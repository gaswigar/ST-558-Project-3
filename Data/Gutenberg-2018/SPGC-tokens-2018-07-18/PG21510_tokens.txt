it
was
the
time
of
sunrise
in
ceyce
the
white
city
placidly
beautiful
capital
of
maccadon
the
university
world
of
the
hub
in
the
colonial
school
sprawling
complex
of
buildings
and
tropical
parks
the
second
student
shift
was
headed
for
breakfast
while
a
larger
part
of
the
fourth
shift
moved
at
a
more
leisurely
rate
toward
their
bunks
the
school
organized
activities
were
not
much
affected
by
the
hour
but
the
big
exercise
quadrangle
was
almost
deserted
for
once
behind
the
railing
of
the
firing
range
a
young
woman
stood
by
herself
gun
in
hand
waiting
for
the
automatic
range
monitor
to
select
a
new
string
of
targets
for
release
she
was
around
slim
and
trim
in
the
school
comfortable
hiking
outfit
tan
shirt
and
shorts
knee
stockings
shoes
her
sun
hat
hung
on
the
railing
and
the
dawn
wind
whipped
strands
of
modishly
hair
along
her
cheeks
she
held
a
small
beautifully
worked
handgun
loosely
beside
her
the
sporting
denton
which
gunwise
citizens
of
the
hub
rated
as
a
weapon
for
the
precisionist
and
expert
only
in
institutions
like
the
colonial
school
it
was
often
seen
at
the
exact
instant
the
monitor
released
its
new
flight
of
targets
she
became
aware
of
the
aircar
gliding
down
toward
her
from
the
administration
buildings
on
the
right
startled
she
glanced
sideways
long
enough
to
identify
the
car
two
occupants
shifted
her
attention
back
to
the
cluster
of
targets
speeding
toward
her
studied
the
flight
pattern
for
another
unhurried
finally
raised
the
denton
the
little
gun
spat
its
noiseless
invisible
needle
of
destruction
eight
times
six
small
puffs
of
crimson
smoke
hung
in
the
air
the
two
remaining
targets
swerved
up
in
a
mocking
curve
and
shot
back
to
their
discharge
huts
the
girl
bit
her
lip
in
moderate
annoyance
safetied
and
holstered
the
gun
and
waved
her
hand
at
the
range
attendant
to
indicate
she
was
finished
then
she
turned
to
face
the
aircar
as
it
settled
slowly
to
the
ground
twenty
feet
away
her
gray
eyes
studied
its
occupants
critically
fine
example
you
set
the
students
she
remarked
flying
right
into
a
hot
gun
range
doctor
plemponi
principal
of
the
colonial
school
smiled
soothingly
eight
years
ago
your
father
bawled
me
out
for
the
very
same
thing
trigger
much
more
abusively
i
must
say
you
know
that
was
my
first
meeting
with
old
runser
argee
and
i
plemp
mihul
chief
of
physical
conditioning
women
division
cautioned
sharply
from
the
seat
behind
him
watch
what
you
doing
you
ass
confused
doctor
plemponi
turned
to
look
at
her
the
aircar
dropped
the
last
four
feet
to
a
jolting
landing
mihul
groaned
plemponi
apologized
trigger
walked
over
to
them
does
he
do
that
often
she
asked
interestedly
every
other
time
mihul
asserted
she
was
a
tall
lean
muscular
slab
of
a
woman
around
forty
she
gave
trigger
a
wink
behind
back
we
keep
the
chiropractors
on
duty
when
we
go
riding
with
plemp
now
then
now
then
doctor
plemponi
said
you
distracted
my
attention
for
a
moment
that
all
now
trigger
the
reason
we
here
is
that
mihul
told
me
at
our
prebreakfast
conference
you
were
entirely
happy
at
the
good
old
colonial
school
so
climb
in
if
you
do
have
much
else
to
do
and
we
run
up
to
the
office
and
discuss
it
he
opened
the
door
for
her
much
else
to
do
trigger
gave
him
a
look
all
right
doctor
run
up
and
discuss
it
she
went
back
for
her
sun
hat
climbed
in
closed
the
door
and
sat
down
beside
him
shoving
the
holstered
denton
forward
on
her
thigh
plemponi
eyed
the
gun
dubiously
brushing
up
in
case
there
another
grabber
raid
he
inquired
he
reached
out
for
the
guide
stick
trigger
shook
her
head
just
working
off
hostility
i
guess
she
waited
till
he
had
lifted
the
car
off
the
ground
in
a
reckless
swoop
that
business
yesterday
it
really
was
a
grabber
raid
we
almost
sure
it
was
mihul
said
behind
her
though
i
did
hear
some
talk
they
might
have
been
after
those
two
plasmoids
in
your
project
not
very
likely
trigger
remarked
the
raiders
were
a
half
mile
away
from
where
they
should
have
come
down
if
the
plasmoids
were
what
they
wanted
and
from
what
i
saw
of
them
they
were
nearly
a
big
enough
gang
for
a
job
of
that
kind
i
thought
so
too
mihul
said
they
were
topflight
professionals
in
any
case
i
got
a
glimpse
of
some
of
their
equipment
knockout
guns
foggers
and
that
was
a
fast
car
very
fast
car
trigger
agreed
it
what
made
me
suspicious
when
i
first
saw
them
come
in
they
also
said
mihul
had
a
interplanetary
hopper
waiting
for
them
in
the
hills
two
more
men
in
it
the
cops
caught
them
too
she
added
they
were
grabbers
all
right
anything
to
indicate
whom
they
were
after
trigger
asked
no
mihul
said
too
many
possibilities
twenty
or
more
of
the
students
in
that
area
at
the
time
had
important
enough
connections
to
class
as
grabber
bait
the
cops
wo
talk
except
to
admit
they
were
tipped
off
about
the
raid
which
was
obvious
the
way
they
popped
up
out
of
nowhere
and
closed
in
on
those
boys
was
a
beautiful
sight
to
see
i
trigger
admitted
did
see
it
when
that
car
homed
in
i
yelled
a
warning
to
the
nearest
bunch
of
students
and
dropped
flat
behind
a
rock
by
the
time
i
risked
a
look
the
cops
had
them
you
showed
very
good
sense
plemponi
told
her
earnestly
i
hope
they
burn
those
thugs
grabbing
a
filthy
business
that
large
object
coming
straight
at
you
mihul
observed
calmly
is
another
aircar
in
this
lane
it
has
the
right
of
way
you
do
not
have
the
right
of
way
got
all
that
plemp
are
you
sure
doctor
plemponi
asked
her
bewilderedly
confound
it
i
shall
blow
my
siren
he
did
trigger
winced
there
plemponi
said
triumphantly
as
the
other
driver
veered
off
in
fright
trigger
told
herself
to
relax
aircars
were
so
nearly
that
even
plemponi
could
do
more
than
snarl
up
traffic
in
one
have
there
been
other
raids
in
the
school
area
since
i
left
she
asked
as
he
shot
up
out
of
the
quadrangle
and
turned
toward
the
balcony
of
his
office
that
was
just
under
four
years
ago
was
it
mihul
said
no
you
were
still
with
us
when
we
had
the
last
one
six
years
back
remember
trigger
did
two
students
had
been
picked
up
on
that
occasion
sons
of
some
federation
official
the
grabbers
had
made
a
clean
getaway
and
it
had
been
several
months
later
before
she
heard
the
boys
had
been
redeemed
safely
plemponi
descended
to
a
teetery
but
gentle
landing
on
the
office
balcony
he
gave
trigger
a
look
see
he
said
tersely
let
go
in
ladies
had
breakfast
yet
trigger
trigger
had
finished
breakfast
a
earlier
but
she
accepted
a
cup
of
coffee
mihul
all
athlete
declined
she
went
over
to
desk
and
stood
leaning
against
it
arms
folded
across
her
chest
calm
blue
eyes
fixed
thoughtfully
on
trigger
with
her
lithe
length
of
body
mihul
sometimes
reminded
trigger
of
a
ferret
but
the
tanned
face
was
a
pleasant
one
and
there
was
humor
around
the
mouth
even
in
pregraduate
days
she
and
mihul
had
been
good
friends
doctor
plemponi
removed
a
crammed
breakfast
tray
from
a
wall
chef
took
a
chair
across
from
trigger
sat
down
with
the
tray
on
his
knees
excused
himself
and
began
to
eat
and
talk
simultaneously
before
we
go
into
that
very
reasonable
complaint
you
made
to
mihul
yesterday
he
said
i
wish
you
let
me
point
out
a
few
things
trigger
nodded
please
do
you
trigger
plemponi
told
her
are
an
honored
guest
here
at
the
colonial
school
you
the
daughter
of
our
late
friend
and
colleague
runser
argee
you
were
one
of
our
star
pupils
not
just
as
a
medallist
either
and
now
you
the
secretary
and
assistant
of
the
famous
precolonial
commissioner
holati
tate
which
makes
you
almost
a
participant
in
what
may
well
turn
out
to
be
the
greatest
scientific
event
of
the
century
i
referring
of
course
plemponi
added
to
tate
discovery
of
the
old
galactic
plasmoids
of
course
agreed
trigger
and
what
is
all
this
leading
up
to
plemp
he
waved
a
piece
of
toast
at
her
no
do
interrupt
i
still
have
to
point
out
that
because
of
the
exceptional
managerial
abilities
you
revealed
under
tate
you
been
sent
here
on
detached
duty
for
the
precolonial
department
to
aid
the
commissioner
and
professor
mantelish
in
the
university
league
plasmoid
project
that
means
you
a
pretty
important
person
trigger
mantelish
for
all
his
idiosyncrasies
is
undoubtedly
the
greatest
living
biologist
in
the
league
and
the
plasmoid
project
here
at
the
school
is
without
question
the
most
important
current
undertaking
so
i
been
told
said
trigger
that
why
i
want
to
find
out
gone
haywire
with
it
in
a
moment
plemponi
said
in
a
moment
he
located
his
napkin
wiped
his
lips
carefully
now
i
mentioned
all
this
simply
to
make
it
very
very
clear
that
we
do
anything
we
can
to
keep
you
satisfied
we
delighted
to
have
you
with
us
we
are
honored
he
beamed
at
her
right
trigger
smiled
if
you
say
so
and
thanks
very
much
for
all
the
lovely
compliments
doctor
but
now
let
get
down
to
business
plemponi
glanced
over
at
mihul
and
looked
evasive
that
being
he
asked
you
know
trigger
said
but
i
put
it
into
specific
questions
if
you
like
where
commissioner
tate
i
do
know
where
is
mantelish
he
shook
his
head
i
do
know
that
either
he
began
to
look
unhappy
oh
said
trigger
who
does
know
then
i
not
allowed
to
tell
you
doctor
plemponi
said
firmly
trigger
raised
an
eyebrow
why
not
federation
security
plemponi
said
frowning
he
added
i
supposed
to
tell
you
that
either
but
what
could
i
do
federation
security
because
of
the
plasmoids
yes
well
i
i
do
know
trigger
sighed
is
it
just
me
you
not
supposed
to
tell
these
things
to
no
no
no
plemponi
said
hastily
nobody
i
not
supposed
to
admit
to
anyone
that
i
know
anything
of
the
whereabouts
of
holati
tate
or
professor
mantelish
fibber
trigger
said
quietly
so
you
know
plemponi
looked
appealingly
at
mihul
she
was
grinning
my
lips
are
sealed
trigger
i
ca
help
it
please
believe
me
let
sum
it
up
then
trigger
said
tapping
the
arm
of
her
chair
with
a
finger
tip
eight
weeks
ago
i
get
pulled
off
my
job
in
the
manon
system
and
sent
here
to
arrange
the
organizational
details
of
this
plasmoid
project
the
only
reason
i
took
on
the
job
as
a
temporary
assignment
was
that
commissioner
tate
convinced
me
it
was
important
to
him
to
have
me
do
it
i
even
let
him
talk
me
into
doing
it
under
the
assumed
name
of
ruya
farn
and
she
reached
up
and
touched
the
side
of
her
head
and
to
dye
my
hair
for
no
sane
reason
that
i
could
discover
he
said
the
had
requested
it
doctor
plemponi
coughed
well
you
know
trigger
how
sensitive
the
league
is
to
personal
notoriety
the
eyebrow
went
up
again
notoriety
not
in
the
wrong
sense
plemponi
said
hastily
but
your
name
become
much
more
widely
known
than
you
may
believe
the
news
viewers
mentioned
you
regularly
in
their
reports
on
harvest
moon
and
the
commissioner
did
they
mihul
mihul
nodded
you
made
good
copy
kid
we
saw
you
in
the
solidopics
any
number
of
times
well
maybe
trigger
said
the
cloak
and
dagger
touches
still
make
much
sense
to
me
but
let
forget
them
and
go
on
when
we
get
here
i
manage
to
see
mantelish
just
once
to
try
to
find
out
what
his
requirements
will
be
he
pretty
vague
about
them
commissioner
tate
is
in
and
out
of
the
project
usually
out
he
also
turned
pretty
vague
about
everything
three
weeks
ago
today
i
told
he
gone
nobody
here
can
or
will
tell
me
where
he
gone
or
how
he
can
be
contacted
the
same
thing
in
the
maccadon
precol
office
same
thing
at
the
evalee
home
office
same
thing
at
the
any
office
then
i
try
to
contact
mantelish
i
informed
he
with
tate
the
two
of
them
have
left
word
i
to
carry
on
she
spread
her
hands
carry
on
with
what
i
done
all
i
can
do
until
i
get
further
instructions
from
the
people
supposedly
directing
this
supposedly
very
urgent
and
important
project
mantelish
does
even
seem
to
have
a
second
in
command
plemponi
nodded
i
was
told
he
had
selected
his
project
assistants
yet
except
said
trigger
for
that
little
flock
of
junior
scientists
who
keep
themselves
locked
in
with
the
plasmoids
they
know
less
than
nothing
and
would
be
too
scared
to
tell
me
that
if
i
asked
them
plemponi
looked
confused
for
a
moment
the
last
sentence
he
checked
himself
well
let
not
quibble
go
on
trigger
said
that
it
holati
did
need
me
on
this
job
to
begin
with
there
nothing
involved
about
the
organizational
aspects
unless
something
begins
to
happen
and
rather
soon
there
no
excuse
for
me
to
stay
here
could
you
plemponi
suggested
regard
this
as
a
kind
of
little
vacation
i
tried
to
regard
it
as
that
holati
impressed
on
me
that
one
of
us
had
to
remain
in
the
area
of
the
project
at
all
times
so
i
have
even
been
able
to
leave
the
school
grounds
i
caught
up
with
my
reading
and
mihul
has
put
me
through
two
of
her
commando
courses
but
the
point
is
that
i
not
on
vacation
i
do
believe
precol
would
feel
that
any
of
my
present
activities
come
under
the
heading
of
detached
duty
work
there
was
a
short
silence
plemponi
stared
down
at
his
empty
tray
said
excuse
me
got
up
and
walked
over
to
the
wall
chef
with
the
tray
wrong
slot
trigger
told
him
he
looked
back
eh
you
want
to
put
it
in
the
disposal
do
you
thanks
plemponi
said
absently
always
doing
that
confusing
them
he
dropped
the
tray
where
it
belonged
shoved
his
hands
into
the
chef
cleaning
recess
and
waved
them
around
then
came
back
still
looking
and
stopped
before
trigger
chair
he
studied
her
face
for
a
moment
commissioner
tate
gave
me
a
message
for
you
he
said
suddenly
trigger
eyes
narrowed
slightly
when
the
day
after
he
left
plemponi
lifted
a
hand
now
wait
you
see
how
it
was
he
called
in
and
said
and
i

you
do
stand
much
of
a
chance
at
keeping
secrets
from
trigger
so
i
give
you
no
unnecessary
secrets
to
keep
if
this
business
we
on
wo
let
us
get
back
to
the
project
in
the
next
couple
of
weeks
she
get
mighty
restless
when
she
starts
to
complain
but
no
earlier
just
tell
her
there
are
reasons
why
i
ca
contact
her
at
present
or
let
her
know
what
i
doing
and
that
i
contact
her
as
soon
as
i
possibly
can
end
of
quote
that
was
all
asked
trigger
yes
he
did
say
a
thing
about
how
long
this
situation
might
continue
no
i
given
you
the
message
word
for
word
my
memory
is
excellent
trigger
so
it
could
be
more
weeks
or
months
yes
possibly
i
imagine
plemponi
had
begun
to
perspire
plemp
said
trigger
will
you
give
holati
a
message
from
me
gladly
said
plemponi
what
oh
oh
he
flushed
right
said
trigger
you
can
contact
him
i
thought
so
doctor
plemponi
looked
reproachful
that
was
unfair
trigger
trigger
shrugged
i
ca
see
any
justification
for
all
this
mystery
that
all
she
stood
up
anyway
here
the
message
tell
him
that
unless
somebody
rather
promptly
gives
me
a
good
sane
reason
for
hanging
around
here
i
ask
precol
to
transfer
me
back
to
the
manon
job
plemponi
gloomily
trigger
he
said
i
do
my
best
about
the
message
but
otherwise
she
smiled
nicely
at
him
i
know
she
said
your
lips
are
sealed
sorry
if
i
disturbed
you
plemp
but
i
just
a
precol
employee
after
all
if
i
to
waste
their
time
i
like
to
know
at
least
why
it
necessary
plemponi
watched
her
walk
out
of
the
room
and
off
down
the
adjoining
hall
in
his
face
consternation
struggled
with
approval
lovely
little
figure
has
she
he
said
to
mihul
he
made
vague
curving
motions
in
the
air
with
one
hand
more
or
less
opposing
ones
with
the
other
that
sort
of
an
lilt
when
she
walks
said
mihul
old
goats
eh
said
doctor
plemponi
i
overheard
you
discussing
trigger
lilt
with
mantelish
plemponi
sat
down
at
his
desk
you
should
eavesdrop
mihul
he
said
severely
i
better
get
that
message
promptly
to
tate
i
suppose
she
meant
what
she
said
do
you
think
every
bit
of
it
said
mihul
tate
warned
me
she
might
get
very
difficult
about
this
time
she
too
conscientious
i
feel
she
also
said
mihul
has
a
boy
friend
in
the
manon
system
been
palsy
ever
since
they
went
through
the
school
here
together
ought
to
get
married
then
plemponi
said
he
shuddered
my
blood
runs
cold
every
time
i
think
of
how
close
those
grabbers
got
to
her
yesterday
mihul
shrugged
relax
they
never
had
a
chance
the
characters
tate
has
guarding
her
are
the
squad
i
ever
saw
go
into
action
that
plemponi
said
reflectively
does
sound
much
like
our
maccadon
police
i
do
think
they
are
imported
talent
of
some
kind
for
my
money
anyway
if
someone
wants
to
pick
up
trigger
argee
here
he
better
come
in
with
a
battleship
plemponi
glanced
nervously
across
the
balcony
at
the
cloudless
blue
sky
about
the
quadrangle
the
impression
i
got
from
holati
tate
he
said
is
that
somebody
might
there
was
a
tube
portal
at
the
end
of
the
hall
outside
doctor
office
mihul
stepped
into
the
portal
punched
the
number
of
her
personal
quarters
waited
till
the
overhead
light
flashed
green
a
few
seconds
later
and
stepped
out
into
another
hall
seventeen
floors
below
plemponi
office
and
a
little
over
a
mile
and
a
half
away
from
it
mihul
crossed
the
hall
went
into
her
apartment
locked
the
door
behind
her
and
punched
a
shield
button
in
her
bedroom
she
opened
a
wall
safe
and
swung
out
a
transmitter
she
switched
the
transmitter
to
active
yes
said
a
voice
mihul
here
said
mihul
quillan
or
the
commissioner
quillan
here
the
transmitter
said
a
few
seconds
later
in
a
different
voice
a
deep
male
one
go
ahead
doll
mihul
grunted
i
calling
she
said
because
i
feel
strongly
that
you
boys
had
better
take
some
immediate
action
in
the
argee
matter
oh
said
the
voice
what
kind
of
action
how
the
devil
would
i
know
i
just
telling
you
i
ca
be
responsible
for
her
here
much
longer
has
something
happened
quillan
asked
quickly
if
you
mean
has
somebody
taken
another
swing
at
her
no
but
she
all
wound
up
to
start
swinging
herself
she
is
going
to
do
much
waiting
either
quillan
said
thoughtfully
has
she
been
that
way
for
quite
a
while
not
like
she
been
the
last
few
days
mihul
hesitated
would
it
be
against
security
if
you
told
me
whether
something
has
happened
to
her
happened
to
her
quillan
repeated
cautiously
to
her
mind
what
makes
you
think
so
mihul
frowned
at
the
transmitter
trigger
always
had
a
temper
she
said
she
was
always
obstinate
she
was
always
an
individualist
and
ready
to
fight
for
her
own
rights
and
anyone
else
but
she
used
to
show
good
sense
she
got
one
of
the
highest
we
ever
processed
through
this
place
the
way
she
acting
now
does
look
too
rational
how
would
she
have
acted
earlier
quillan
asked
mihul
considered
she
would
have
been
very
annoyed
with
commissioner
tate
she
said
i
do
blame
her
for
that
i
be
too
in
the
circumstances
when
he
got
back
she
have
wanted
a
reasonable
explanation
for
what
has
been
going
on
if
she
did
get
one
that
satisfied
her
she
have
quit
but
she
have
waited
till
he
got
back
why
not
after
all
you
do
think
she
going
to
wait
now
i
do
not
mihul
said
she
forwarded
him
a
kind
of
ultimatum
through
plemponi
in
effect
frankly
i
would
care
to
guarantee
she
stay
around
to
hear
the
answer
hm
what
do
you
expect
she
do
take
off
mihul
said
one
way
or
the
other
ungh
quillan
said
disgustedly
you
make
it
sound
like
the
got
space
drives
you
can
stop
her
ca
you
certainly
i
can
stop
her
mihul
said
if
i
can
lock
her
in
her
room
and
sit
on
her
to
make
sure
she
does
leave
by
the
window
but
you
the
one
who
stressed
she
is
to
know
being
watched
true
quillan
said
promptly
i
spoke
like
a
loon
mihul
true
major
quillan
sir
said
mihul
now
try
again
the
transmitter
was
silent
a
few
seconds
could
you
guarantee
her
for
three
days
he
asked
i
could
not
said
mihul
i
could
guarantee
her
another
three
hours
as
bad
as
that
yes
said
mihul
as
bad
as
that
she
was
controlling
herself
with
plemponi
but
i
been
observing
her
in
the
physical
workouts
i
fed
it
to
her
as
heavy
as
i
could
but
there
a
limit
to
what
you
can
do
that
way
she
kept
herself
in
very
good
shape
one
of
the
best
i
been
told
said
quillan
condition
i
meant
said
mihul
anyway
she
trained
down
fine
right
now
any
more
of
it
would
just
make
her
edgier
you
know
how
it
goes
he
said
fighter
nerves
same
deal
mihul
agreed
there
was
a
short
pause
how
about
slapping
a
guard
on
all
colonial
school
exits
he
suggested
can
you
send
me
an
army
no
then
forget
it
she
was
a
student
here
remember
last
year
a
bunch
of
our
students
smuggled
the
stuffed
restructured
mastodon
out
and
left
it
in
the
back
garden
of
the
mayor
of
ceyce
just
for
laughs
too
many
exits
and
trigger
was
a
trickier
monkey
than
most
that
way
when
she
felt
like
it
she
fade
out
of
here
whenever
she
wants
to
it
those
damn
tube
portal
systems
said
quillan
with
feeling
most
gruesome
invention
that
ever
hit
the
tailing
profession
he
sighed
you
win
mihul
the
commissioner
is
in
at
the
moment
but
whether
he
gets
in
or
not
i
have
someone
over
today
to
pick
her
up
matter
of
fact
i
come
along
myself
good
for
you
boy
mihul
said
relievedly
did
you
get
anything
out
of
yesterday
grabbers
a
little
her
do
harm
her
were
their
instructions
otherwise
it
was
like
with
those
other
slobs
a
hole
in
the
head
where
the
real
info
should
be
but
at
least
we
know
for
sure
now
that
someone
is
specifically
after
argee
the
price
was
kind
of
interesting
what
was
it
flat
half
million
credits
mihul
whistled
poor
trigger
well
nobody
very
likely
to
earn
the
money
i
hope
not
she
a
good
kid
all
right
major
signing
off
now
hold
on
a
minute
said
quillan
you
asked
a
while
ago
if
the
girl
had
gone
so
i
did
mihul
said
surprised
you
did
say
i
figured
it
was
against
security
it
probably
is
quillan
admitted
everything
seems
to
be
right
now
i
given
up
trying
to
keep
up
with
that
anyway
i
do
know
that
she
has
neither
does
the
commissioner
but
he
worried
and
argee
has
a
date
she
does
know
about
with
the
psychology
service
four
days
from
now
the
eggheads
mihul
was
startled
what
do
they
want
with
her
you
know
quillan
remarked
reflectively
that
odd
they
think
to
tell
me
why
are
you
letting
me
know
mihul
asked
you
find
out
doll
he
said
the
guard
leaning
against
the
wall
opposite
the
portal
snapped
to
attention
as
it
opened
trigger
stepped
out
he
gave
her
a
fine
flourish
of
a
salute
good
morning
miss
farn
morning
trigger
said
she
flashed
him
a
smile
did
the
mail
get
in
just
twenty
minutes
ago
she
nodded
smiled
again
and
walked
past
him
to
her
office
she
always
got
along
fine
with
cops
of
almost
any
description
and
these
league
boys
were
extraordinarily
pleasant
and
polite
they
were
also
noticed
a
remarkably
muscled
group
she
locked
the
office
door
behind
her
part
of
the
plasmoid
elaborate
security
precautions
went
over
to
her
mail
file
and
found
it
empty
which
meant
that
whatever
had
come
in
was
purely
routine
and
already
being
handled
by
her
skeleton
office
staff
later
in
the
day
she
might
get
a
chance
to
scrawl
ruya
farn
signature
on
a
few
dozen
letters
and
checks
big
job
trigger
sat
down
at
her
desk
she
brooded
there
a
minute
or
two
tapping
her
teeth
with
her
thumbnail
the
honorable
precolonial
commissioner
tate
whatever
else
might
be
said
of
him
undoubtedly
was
one
of
the
brainiest
little
characters
ever
come
across
he
probably
saw
some
quite
valid
reason
for
keeping
her
here
isolated
and
uninformed
the
question
was
what
the
reason
could
be
security
trigger
wrinkled
her
nose
security
did
mean
a
thing
everybody
and
everything
associated
with
the
old
galactic
plasmoids
had
been
wrapped
up
in
federation
security
measures
since
the
day
the
plasmoid
discovery
was
announced
and
she
been
in
the
middle
of
the
operations
concerning
them
right
along
why
should
holati
tate
have
turned
secretive
on
her
now
when
even
blabby
old
plemponi
could
contact
him
it
was
more
than
a
little
annoying
trigger
shrugged
reached
into
a
desk
drawer
and
took
out
a
small
solidopic
she
set
it
on
the
desk
and
regarded
it
moodily
the
face
of
an
almost
improbably
handsome
young
man
looked
back
at
her
startling
eyes
a
strong
chin
curly
brown
hair
there
was
a
gleam
of
white
teeth
behind
the
quick
warm
smile
which
always
awoke
a
responsive
glow
in
her
she
and
brule
inger
had
been
the
nearest
thing
to
engaged
for
the
last
two
and
a
half
years
ever
since
precol
sent
them
out
together
to
its
project
on
manon
planet
they
been
dating
before
that
while
they
were
both
still
attending
the
colonial
school
but
now
she
was
here
perhaps
stuck
here
indefinitely
unless
she
did
something
about
it
and
brule
was
on
manon
planet
by
the
very
fastest
subspace
ships
the
manon
system
was
a
good
nine
days
away
for
the
standard
grand
commerce
express
freighter
or
the
ordinary
liner
it
was
a
solid
run
manon
was
a
way
away
it
was
almost
a
month
since
she
even
heard
from
brule
she
could
make
up
another
personal
tape
to
him
today
if
she
felt
like
it
he
would
get
it
in
fourteen
days
or
so
via
a
federation
packet
but
she
already
sent
him
three
without
reply
brule
was
at
all
good
at
long
distance
and
she
did
blame
him
much
she
was
a
little
awkward
herself
when
it
came
to
feeding
her
personal
feelings
into
a
tape
and
because
of
security
again
there
was
very
little
else
she
could
feed
into
it
she
could
even
let
brule
know
just
where
she
was
she
put
the
solido
back
in
its
drawer
reached
for
one
of
the
bank
of
buttons
on
the
right
side
of
the
desk
and
pushed
it
down
a
desk
panel
slid
up
vertically
in
front
of
her
disclosing
a
news
viewer
switched
to
the
index
of
current
headlines
trigger
glanced
over
the
headlines
while
a
few
items
dissolved
slowly
here
and
there
and
were
replaced
by
more
recent
developments
under
the
science
heading
a
great
deal
seemed
to
be
going
on
as
usual
in
connection
with
plasmoid
experiments
around
the
hub
she
dialed
in
the
heading
skimmed
through
the
first
item
that
appeared
essentially
it
was
a
summary
of
reports
on
hubwide
rumors
that
nobody
could
claim
any
worthwhile
progress
in
determining
what
made
the
old
galactic
plasmoids
tick
which
so
far
as
trigger
knew
was
quite
true
other
rumors
rather
unpleasant
ones
were
that
the
five
hundred
or
so
scientific
groups
to
whom
individual
plasmoids
had
been
issued
by
the
federation
university
league
actually
had
gained
important
information
but
were
keeping
it
to
themselves
the
summary
plowed
through
a
few
of
the
learned
opinions
and
counteropinions
most
recently
obtained
then
boiled
them
down
to
the
statement
that
a
plasmoid
might
be
compared
to
an
engine
which
appeared
to
lack
nothing
but
an
energy
source
or
perhaps
more
correctly
assuming
it
might
have
an
as
yet
unidentified
energy
source
a
starter
button
one
group
claimed
to
have
virtually
duplicated
the
plasmoid
loaned
to
it
by
the
federation
producing
a
biochemical
structure
distinguishable
from
the
old
galactic
model
only
by
the
fact
that
it
had
quite
predictably
fallen
apart
within
hours
but
plasmoids
did
fall
apart
the
specimens
undergoing
study
had
shown
no
signs
of
deterioration
a
few
still
absorbed
nourishment
from
time
to
time
some
had
been
observed
to
move
slightly
but
none
could
be
induced
to
operate
it
was
all
very
puzzling
it
very
puzzling
trigger
conceded
back
in
the
manon
system
when
they
had
been
discovered
the
plasmoids
were
operating
with
high
efficiency
on
the
station
which
the
mysterious
old
galactics
appeared
to
have
abandoned
or
forgotten
about
some
hundreds
of
centuries
ago
it
was
only
when
humans
entered
the
base
and
switched
off
its
mechanical
operations
that
the
plasmoids
stopped
working
and
then
when
the
switches
which
appeared
to
have
kept
them
going
were
expectantly
closed
again
they
had
stayed
stopped
personally
trigger
could
have
cared
less
if
they
never
did
move
it
was
nice
that
old
holati
tate
had
made
an
almost
indecently
vast
fortune
out
of
his
rights
to
the
things
because
she
was
really
very
fond
of
the
commissioner
when
he
was
being
irritating
but
in
some
obscure
way
she
found
the
plasmoids
themselves
and
the
idea
of
unlimited
plastic
life
which
they
embodied
rather
appalling
however
she
was
in
a
minority
there
practically
everybody
else
seemed
to
feel
that
plasmoids
were
the
biggest
improvement
since
the
creation
of
eve
she
switched
the
viewer
presently
to
its
setting
and
dialed
in
the
manon
system
reference
number
keeping
tab
on
what
was
going
on
out
there
had
become
a
private
little
ritual
of
late
occasionally
she
even
picked
up
references
to
brule
inger
who
functioned
nowadays
as
precol
official
greeter
and
contact
man
in
the
system
he
was
very
popular
with
the
numerous
important
hub
citizens
who
made
the
long
run
out
to
the
manon
some
bent
on
getting
a
firsthand
view
of
the
marvels
of
old
galactic
science
and
a
great
many
more
bent
on
getting
an
early
stake
in
the
development
of
manon
planet
which
was
rapidly
approaching
the
point
where
its
status
would
shift
from
precol
project
to
federation
territory
opening
it
to
all
qualified
comers
today
there
was
no
news
about
brule
grand
commerce
had
opened
its
first
business
and
recreation
center
on
manon
not
ten
miles
from
the
precol
headquarters
dome
where
trigger
recently
had
been
working
the
subspace
net
which
was
being
installed
about
the
old
galactic
base
was
very
nearly
completed
the
permanent
hub
population
on
manon
planet
had
just
passed
the
thousand
mark
there
had
been
trigger
recalled
a
trifle
nostalgically
barely
eight
hundred
precol
employees
and
not
another
human
being
on
that
world
in
the
days
before
holati
tate
announced
his
discovery
she
was
just
letting
the
viewer
panel
slide
back
into
the
desk
when
the
office
comweb
gave
forth
with
a
musical
ping
she
switched
it
on
hi
rak
she
said
cheerily
anything
new
the
young
man
looking
out
at
her
wore
the
lusterless
black
uniform
of
a
junior
scientist
his
expression
was
worried
he
said
i
believe
there
is
miss
farn
rak
was
the
group
leader
of
the
junior
scientists
the
league
had
installed
in
the
project
like
all
the
juniors
he
took
his
duties
very
seriously
unfortunately
it
nothing
i
can
discuss
over
a
communicator
would
it
be
possible
for
you
to
come
over
and
meet
with
us
during
the
day
that
trigger
stated
was
a
ridiculous
question
rak
want
me
over
right
now
he
grinned
thanks
miss
farn
in
twenty
minutes
then
i
get
my
advisory
committee
together
and
we
can
meet
in
the
little
conference
room
off
the
exhibition
hall
trigger
nodded
i
be
wandering
around
the
hall
just
send
a
guard
out
to
get
me
when
you
ready
she
switched
off
the
comweb
and
stood
up
rak
and
his
group
were
stuck
with
the
plasmoid
project
a
lot
more
solidly
than
she
was
they
been
established
here
confined
to
their
own
wing
of
the
project
area
when
she
came
in
from
manon
with
the
commissioner
until
the
present
security
rulings
were
relaxed
which
might
not
be
for
another
two
years
they
would
remain
on
the
project
trigger
felt
a
little
sorry
for
them
though
the
junior
scientists
did
seem
to
mind
the
setup
dedication
stood
out
all
over
them
since
about
half
were
young
women
one
could
assume
that
at
any
rate
they
were
condemned
to
a
completely
monastic
existence
a
couple
of
workmen
were
guiding
a
dozen
big
cleaning
robots
around
the
plasmoid
exhibition
hall
which
would
be
open
to
students
or
visitors
for
another
few
hours
trigger
strolled
across
the
floor
of
the
huge
area
toward
a
couple
of
exhibits
that
had
been
there
the
last
time
she
come
through
replicas
of
two
plasmoids
numbers
and
she
discovered
she
regarded
the
lumpish
partially
translucent
forms
with
some
distaste
she
been
all
over
the
old
galactic
station
itself
and
might
have
stood
close
enough
to
the
originals
of
these
models
to
touch
them
not
that
she
would
have
she
glanced
at
her
watch
walked
around
a
scale
model
of
harvest
moon
the
station
which
occupied
the
center
of
the
hall
and
went
on
among
the
exhibits
there
were
views
taken
on
manon
planet
in
one
alcove
mainly
of
manon
aerial
plankton
belt
and
of
the
giant
plasmoids
called
harvesters
which
had
moved
about
the
belt
methodically
engulfing
its
clouds
of
living
matter
a
replica
of
a
harvester
dominated
one
end
of
the
hall
a
giant
sausage
in
external
appearance
though
with
some
extremely
fancy
internal
arrangements
miss
farn
she
turned
a
league
cop
standing
at
the
entrance
of
a
hallway
thirty
feet
away
pitched
her
the
old
flourish
and
followed
it
up
with
a
bow
excellent
manners
these
guard
boys
had
trigger
gave
him
a
smile
coming
she
said
junior
scientist
rak
and
his
advisory
committee
two
other
young
men
and
a
young
woman
were
waiting
in
the
conference
room
for
her
they
all
stood
up
when
she
came
in
this
room
marked
the
border
of
their
territory
they
would
have
violated
several
league
rules
by
venturing
out
into
the
hall
through
which
trigger
had
entered
and
that
would
have
been
unthinkable
rak
did
the
talking
as
on
the
previous
occasions
when
trigger
had
met
with
this
group
the
advisory
committee
simply
sat
there
and
watched
him
as
far
as
trigger
could
figure
it
they
were
present
at
these
sessions
only
to
check
rak
if
it
looked
as
if
he
were
about
to
commit
some
ghastly
indiscretion
we
were
wondering
miss
farn
rak
said
questioningly
whether
you
have
the
authority
to
requisition
additional
university
league
guards
for
the
plasmoid
project
trigger
shook
her
head
i
got
no
authority
of
any
kind
that
i
know
of
as
far
as
the
league
is
concerned
no
doubt
professor
mantelish
could
arrange
it
for
you
rak
nodded
is
it
possible
for
you
to
contact
professor
mantelish
no
trigger
said
she
smiled
is
it
possible
for
you
to
contact
him
rak
glanced
around
his
committee
as
if
looking
for
approval
then
said
no
it
is
as
a
matter
of
fact
miss
farn
we
been
isolated
here
in
the
most
curious
fashion
for
the
past
few
weeks
so
have
i
said
miss
farn
rak
looked
startled
oh
he
said
we
were
hoping
you
would
be
willing
to
give
us
a
little
information
i
would
trigger
assured
him
if
i
had
any
to
give
i
do
unfortunately
she
considered
why
do
you
feel
additional
league
guards
are
required
we
heard
rak
remarked
cautiously
that
there
were
raiders
in
the
colonial
school
area
yesterday
grabbers
trigger
said
they
would
bother
you
your
section
of
the
project
is
supposed
to
be
raidproof
anyway
rak
glanced
at
his
companions
again
and
apparently
received
some
undetectable
sign
of
consent
miss
farn
as
you
know
our
group
has
been
entrusted
with
the
care
of
two
league
plasmoids
here
are
you
aware
that
six
of
the
plasmoids
which
were
distributed
to
responsible
laboratories
throughout
the
hub
have
been
lost
to
unknown
raiders
she
was
startled
no
i
did
know
that
i
heard
there
been
some
unsuccessful
attempts
to
steal
distributed
plasmoids
these
six
attempts
rak
said
primly
were
completely
successful
one
must
assume
that
the
victimized
laboratories
also
had
been
regarded
as
raidproof
trigger
admitted
it
was
a
reasonable
assumption
there
is
another
matter
rak
went
on
when
we
arrived
here
we
understood
doctor
gess
fayle
was
to
bring
plasmoid
unit
to
this
project
it
seems
possible
that
doctor
fayle
failure
to
appear
indicates
that
league
headquarters
does
not
consider
the
project
a
sufficiently
safe
place
for
why
do
you
ask
headquarters
trigger
suggested
they
stirred
nervously
that
would
be
a
violation
of
the
principle
of
the
chain
of
command
miss
farn
rak
explained
oh
she
said
the
juniors
were
overdisciplined
all
right
is
that
such
a
particularly
important
item
if
doctor
fayle
is
in
personal
charge
of
it
rak
said
carefully
i
would
say
yes
recalling
her
meetings
with
doctor
gess
fayle
in
the
manon
system
trigger
silently
agreed
he
was
one
of
the
big
shots
a
political
scientist
who
had
got
himself
appointed
as
mantelish
chief
assistant
when
that
eminent
biologist
was
first
sent
to
manon
to
take
over
league
operations
there
trigger
had
disliked
fayle
on
sight
and
had
changed
her
mind
on
closer
acquaintance
i
remember
that
unit
now
she
said
suddenly
big
ugly
thing
well
that
describes
a
lot
of
them
does
it
rak
and
the
others
looked
quietly
affronted
in
a
moment
trigger
realized
one
of
them
was
going
to
go
into
a
lecture
on
functional
esthetics
unless
she
could
head
them
off
and
she
already
heard
quite
enough
about
functional
esthetics
in
connection
with
the
plasmoids
now
she
hurried
on
is
a
very
small
plasmoid
she
held
her
hands
fifteen
inches
or
so
apart
like
that
and
it
attached
to
the
big
one
correct
rak
nodded
a
little
stiffly
essentially
correct
miss
farn
well
trigger
said
i
ca
blame
you
for
worrying
a
bit
how
about
your
guard
captain
is
it
all
right
to
ask
him
about
reinforcements
rak
pursed
his
lips
yes
and
i
did
this
morning
before
i
called
you
what
did
he
say
rak
grimaced
unhappily
he
implied
miss
farn
that
his
present
guard
complement
could
handle
any
emergency
how
would
he
know
that
his
job
trigger
pointed
out
gently
the
juniors
did
look
badly
worried
he
did
have
any
helpful
ideas
none
said
rak
he
said
that
if
someone
wanted
to
put
up
the
money
to
hire
a
battle
squad
of
special
federation
police
he
could
always
find
some
use
for
them
but
that
hopeless
of
course
trigger
straightened
up
she
reached
out
and
poked
rak
bony
chest
with
a
finger
tip
you
know
something
she
said
it
not
the
four
faces
lit
up
together
the
fact
is
trigger
went
on
that
i
handling
the
project
budget
until
someone
shows
up
to
take
over
so
i
think
i
just
buy
you
that
federation
battle
squad
rak
i
get
on
it
right
away
she
stood
up
the
juniors
bounced
automatically
out
of
their
chairs
you
go
tell
your
guard
captain
she
instructed
them
from
the
hall
door
there
be
a
squad
showing
up
in
time
for
dinner
tonight
the
federation
police
office
in
ceyce
informed
trigger
that
a
class
a
battle
squad
twenty
trained
men
with
full
equipment
would
report
for
two
months
duty
at
the
colonial
school
during
the
afternoon
she
made
them
out
a
check
and
gave
it
the
ruya
farn
signature
via
telewriter
the
figure
on
that
check
was
going
to
cause
some
auditor
eyebrows
to
fly
off
the
top
of
his
head
one
of
these
days
but
if
the
league
insisted
on
remaining
aloof
to
the
problems
of
its
plasmoid
project
a
little
financial
anguish
was
the
least
it
could
expect
in
return
trigger
felt
quite
cheerful
for
a
while
then
she
had
a
call
from
precol
maccadon
office
she
was
requested
to
stand
by
while
a
personal
interstellar
transmission
was
switched
to
her
comweb
it
looked
like
her
day
she
hummed
softly
waiting
she
knew
just
one
individual
affluent
enough
to
be
able
to
afford
personal
interstellar
conversations
and
that
was
commissioner
tate
fast
work
plemp
she
thought
approvingly
but
it
was
brule
inger
face
that
flashed
into
view
on
the
comweb
trigger
heart
jumped
her
breath
caught
in
her
throat
brule
she
yelled
then
she
shot
up
out
of
her
chair
where
are
you
calling
from
brule
eyes
crinkled
around
the
edges
he
gave
her
the
smile
the
good
old
smile
unfortunately
darling
i
still
in
the
manon
system
he
blinked
what
happened
to
your
hair
manon
said
trigger
she
started
to
settle
back
weak
with
disappointment
then
she
shot
up
again
brule
lunatic
you
blowing
a
month
salary
a
minute
on
this
i
love
you
switch
off
fast
brule
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
you
have
changed
much
in
two
months
anyway
do
worry
it
for
free
i
calling
from
the
yacht
of
a
friend
some
friend
trigger
said
startled
it
is
costing
her
anything
either
she
had
to
transmit
to
the
hub
today
anyway
asked
me
if
i
like
to
take
over
the
last
few
minutes
of
contact
and
see
if
i
could
locate
you
been
missing
me
properly
trigger
trigger
smiled
very
properly
well
that
was
lovely
of
her
someone
i
know
hardly
said
brule
nelauk
arrived
a
week
or
so
after
you
left
nelauk
pluly
her
father
the
pluly
lines
let
talk
about
you
the
idea
got
talked
into
it
she
told
him
it
all
the
rage
again
right
now
he
surveyed
her
critically
i
like
you
better
as
a
redhead
so
do
i
oops
trigger
thought
security
girl
so
i
change
back
tonight
she
went
on
quickly
golly
brule
it
nice
to
see
that
homely
old
mug
again
be
a
lot
nicer
when
it
wo
have
to
be
over
a
transmitter
right
you
are
when
are
you
coming
back
she
shook
her
head
glumly
do
know
he
was
silent
a
moment
i
had
to
take
a
bit
of
chitchat
now
and
then
he
remarked
about
you
and
old
tate
vanishing
together
trigger
felt
herself
coloring
so
do
take
it
she
said
shortly
just
pop
them
one
the
smile
returned
would
be
gentlemanly
to
pop
a
lady
would
it
she
smiled
back
so
stay
away
from
the
ladies
somehow
brule
and
holati
tate
never
had
worked
up
a
really
warm
regard
for
each
other
it
had
caused
a
little
trouble
before
okay
to
tell
me
where
you
are
he
asked
afraid
not
brule
precol
home
office
apparently
knows
he
pointed
out
apparently
trigger
admitted
they
looked
at
each
other
a
moment
then
brule
grinned
well
keep
your
little
secret
he
said
all
i
really
want
to
know
is
when
getting
back
very
soon
i
hope
brule
trigger
said
unhappily
then
there
was
a
sudden
burst
of
sound
from
the
comweb
gusts
of
laughing
chattering
voices
a
faint
wash
of
music
brule
glanced
aside
party
going
on
he
explained
and
here
comes
nelauk
she
wanted
to
say
hello
to
you
a
dozen
feet
behind
him
a
figure
strolled
gracefully
into
view
on
the
screen
and
came
forward
a
slender
girl
with
violet
hair
and
eyes
that
very
nearly
matched
the
hair
tint
she
was
dressed
in
something
resembling
a
dozen
blossoms
blossoms
which
in
opinion
had
been
rather
carelessly
scattered
but
presumably
it
was
a
very
elegant
party
costume
she
was
quite
young
certainly
not
yet
twenty
brule
laid
a
brotherly
hand
on
a
powdered
shoulder
meet
trigger
nelauk
nelauk
murmured
it
was
indeed
an
honor
one
she
had
long
looked
forward
to
the
violet
eyes
blinked
sleepily
at
trigger
trigger
gave
her
a
great
big
smile
thanks
so
much
for
arranging
for
the
call
i
been
wondering
how
brule
was
doing
wrong
thing
to
say
probably
she
thought
she
was
right
nelauk
reached
for
it
with
no
effort
oh
he
doing
wonderfully
she
assured
trigger
without
expression
i
keeping
an
eye
on
him
and
this
small
favor
it
was
the
very
least
i
could
do
for
brule
for
you
too
of
course
trigger
dear
trigger
held
the
smile
firmly
thanks
so
much
again
she
said
nelauk
nodded
smiled
back
and
drifted
gracefully
off
the
screen
brule
blew
trigger
a
kiss
they
be
cutting
contact
now
see
you
very
very
soon
trigger
i
hope
his
image
vanished
before
she
could
answer
she
paced
her
office
muttering
softly
she
went
over
to
the
comweb
once
reached
out
toward
it
and
drew
her
hand
back
again
better
think
this
over
it
might
not
be
an
emergency
brule
did
exactly
chase
women
he
let
them
chase
him
now
and
then
long
before
she
left
manon
trigger
had
discovered
without
much
surprise
that
the
wives
daughters
and
girl
friends
of
visiting
hub
tycoons
were
as
susceptible
to
the
inger
charm
as
any
precol
clerks
the
main
difference
was
that
they
were
a
lot
more
direct
about
showing
it
it
had
really
worried
her
in
fact
she
found
brule
slightly
startled
reports
of
maneuverings
of
various
amorous
hub
ladies
very
entertaining
but
she
had
put
in
a
little
worrying
about
something
else
brule
susceptibility
seemed
to
be
more
to
the
overwhelming
mass
display
of
wealth
with
which
he
was
suddenly
in
almost
constant
contact
many
of
the
yachts
he
went
flitting
around
among
as
representative
were
elaborate
spacegoing
palaces
and
it
appeared
brule
inger
was
soon
regarded
as
a
highly
welcome
guest
on
most
of
them
brule
talked
about
that
a
little
too
much
trigger
resumed
her
pacing
little
nelauk
might
be
twenty
yet
but
she
flipped
out
a
challenge
just
now
with
all
the
languid
confidence
of
a
veteran
campaigner
which
trigger
thought
cattily
little
nelauk
undoubtedly
was
and
a
girl
she
added
cattily
whose
father
represented
the
pluly
lines
did
have
some
slight
reason
for
confidence

she

herself

be
honest
about
it

a

she
went
back
to
her

and
sat
down
she
looked
at
the
comweb
a
girl
had
a
right
to
consider
her
own
interests
and
there
was
the
completely
gruesome
possibility
now
that
holati

call
in
at
any
moment
give
her
an
entirely
reasonable
satisfactory
valid
convincing
explanation
for
everything
that

he

cut

she
stared
at
the

feeling
a
little
shaken
all
she
done
was
to
say
she
wanted
to
apply
for
a

undersecretary
rozan
was
one
of
precol
big
four
for
a
moment
trigger
had
an
uncanny
notion
some
strange
madness
was
spreading
insidiously
through
the
hub
she
shook
the
thought
off
a
businesslike
blonde
showed
up
in
the
screen
she
might
be
about
she
smiled
a
small
cold
smile
rozan
she
said
you

i

about

what
the

trigger
looked
at
her
wondering
no

she
said

just
routed
me
through

they

instructed
to
do
so
said
rozan

she
half
turned

a

and
snapped
it
into
her

she
glanced
out
at

your

she
slid
a

into
her
telewriter
shifted
it
twice
as

deposited
thumbprint
and
signature
and
drew
it
out
the
application
will
be
processed
promptly
argee
good
day
not
a
gabby
type
that
rozan
if
not
gabby
the
precol
blonde
was
a
woman
of
her
word
trigger
had
just
started
lunch
when
the
office
receiver
tinkled
brightly
at
her
she
reached
in
took
out
a
flat
plastic
carrier
snapped
it
open
the
paper
that
unfolded
itself
in
her
hand
was
her
retransfer
application
at
the
bottom
of
the
form
was
stamped
application
denied
followed
by
the
signature
of
the
secretary
of
the
department
of
precolonization
home
office
evalee
trigger
gaze
shifted
incredulously
from
the
signature
to
the
two
words
and
back
they
taken
the
trouble
to
get
that
signature
transmitted
from
evalee
just
to
make
it
clear
that
there
were
no
heads
left
to
be
gone
over
in
the
matter
precol
was
not
transferring
her
back
to
manon
that
was
final
then
she
realized
that
there
was
a
second
sheet
attached
to
the
application
form
on
it
in
handwriting
were
a
few
more
words
in
accordance
with
the
instructions
of
commissioner
tate
and
a
signature
rozan
and
three
final
words
destroy
this
note
trigger
crumpled
up
the
application
in
one
hand
her
other
hand
darted
to
the
comweb
then
she
checked
herself
to
fire
an
resignation
back
at
precol
had
been
the
immediate
impulse
but
something
some
vague
warning
chill
was
saying
it
might
be
a
very
poor
impulse
to
follow
she
sat
back
to
think
it
over
it
was
very
probable
that
undersecretary
rozan
disliked
holati
tate
intensely
a
lot
of
the
home
office
big
shots
disliked
holati
tate
stamped
on
their
toes
more
than
once
very
justifiably
but
stamped
the
home
office
would
go
an
inch
out
of
its
way
to
do
something
just
because
commissioner
tate
happened
to
want
it
done
so
somebody
else
was
backing
up
commissioner
tate
instructions
trigger
shook
her
head
helplessly
the
only
somebody
else
who
give
instructions
to
the
precolonization
department
was
the
council
of
the
federation
and
how
could
the
federation
possibly
care
what
trigger
argee
was
doing
she
made
a
small
incredulous
noise
in
her
throat
then
she
sat
there
a
while
feeling
frightened
the
fright
did
really
wear
off
but
it
settled
down
slowly
inside
her
up
on
the
surface
she
began
to
think
again
assume
it
so
she
instructed
herself
it
made
no
sense
but
everything
else
made
even
less
sense
just
assume
it
so
set
it
up
as
a
practical
problem
do
worry
about
the
why
the
problem
became
very
simple
then
she
wanted
to
go
to
manon
the
federation
or
something
else
something
quite
unthinkable
at
the
moment
but
comparable
to
the
federation
in
power
and
influence
wanted
to
keep
her
here
she
uncrumpled
the
application
detached
rozan
note
tore
up
the
note
and
dropped
its
shreds
into
the
wall
disposal
that
obligation
was
cancelled
she
did
have
any
other
obligations
she
liked
holati
tate
when
all
this
was
cleared
up
she
might
find
she
still
liked
him
at
the
moment
she
did
owe
him
a
thing
now
assume
they
had
just
blocked
the
obvious
route
to
manon
they
could
block
all
routes
to
everywhere
that
was
impossible
but
they
could
very
well
be
watching
to
see
that
she
did
simply
get
up
and
walk
off
and
they
might
be
very
well
prepared
to
take
quite
direct
action
to
stop
her
from
doing
it
she
would
trigger
decided
leave
the
method
she
use
to
get
out
of
the
colonial
school
unobserved
to
the
last
that
should
present
any
serious
difficulties
once
she
was
outside
what
would
she
do
principally
she
had
to
buy
transportation
and
that
since
she
had
no
intention
of
spending
a
few
months
on
the
trip
and
since
a
private
citizen
did
have
the
ghost
of
a
chance
at
squeezing
aboard
a
federation
packet
on
the
manon
run
was
going
to
be
expensive
in
fact
it
was
likely
to
take
the
bulk
of
her
savings
under
the
circumstances
however
expense
was
important
if
precol
refused
to
give
her
back
her
job
when
she
showed
up
on
manon
a
number
of
the
industrial
outfits
preparing
to
move
in
as
soon
as
the
plant
got
its
final
clearance
would
be
very
happy
to
have
her
she
already
turned
down
a
dozen
offers
at
considerably
more
than
her
present
salary
so
she
get
off
the
school
grounds
take
a
tube
strip
into
downtown
ceyce
step
into
a
comweb
booth
and
call
grand
commerce
transportation
for
information
on
the
earliest
subspace
runs
to
manon
she
reserve
a
berth
on
the
first
fast
boat
out
in
the
name
of
see
in
the
name
of
birna
drellgannoth
who
had
been
a
friend
of
hers
when
they
were
around
the
age
of
ten
since
manon
was
a
precol
preserve
she
would
have
to
meet
the
problem
of
precise
personal
identification
such
as
one
ran
into
when
booking
passage
to
some
of
the
member
worlds
the
ticket
office
would
have
her
thumbprints
then
that
was
unavoidable
but
there
were
millions
of
thumbprints
being
deposited
every
hour
of
the
day
on
maccadon
if
somebody
started
checking
for
her
by
that
method
it
should
take
them
a
good
long
while
to
sort
out
hers
next
stop
the
ceyce
branch
of
the
bank
of
maccadon
and
it
was
lucky
she
done
all
her
banking
in
ceyce
since
she
was
a
because
she
would
have
to
present
herself
in
person
to
draw
out
her
savings
she
better
lose
no
time
getting
to
the
bank
either
it
was
one
place
where
theoretical
searchers
could
expect
her
to
show
up
she
could
pay
for
her
ship
reservation
at
the
bank
then
to
a
store
for
some
clothes
and
a
suitcase
for
the
trip
and
finally
into
some
big
hotel
where
she
would
stay
quietly
until
a
few
hours
before
the
ship
was
due
to
take
off
that
seemed
to
cover
it
it
probably
was
foolproof
but
trying
to
work
out
a
foolproof
plan
would
be
a
waste
of
time
when
she
did
know
just
what
she
was
up
against
this
should
give
her
a
running
start
a
long
one
when
should
she
leave
right
now
she
decided
commissioner
tate
presumably
would
be
informed
that
she
had
applied
for
a
transfer
and
that
the
transfer
had
been
denied
he
knew
her
too
well
not
to
become
suspicious
if
it
looked
as
if
she
were
just
sitting
there
and
taking
it
she
got
her
secretary
on
the
comweb
i
thinking
of
leaving
the
office
she
said
anything
for
me
to
take
care
of
first
it
was
a
safe
question
she
signed
the
day
mail
and
checks
before
lunch
not
a
thing
miss
farn
fine
said
ruya
farn
if
anyone
wants
me
in
the
next
three
or
four
hours
i
be
either
down
in
the
main
library
or
out
at
the
lake
and
that
would
give
somebody
two
rather
extensive
areas
to
look
for
her
if
and
when
they
started
to
look
along
with
the
fact
that
for
all
anyone
knew
she
might
be
anywhere
between
those
two
points
a
few
minutes
later
trigger
sauntered
humming
blithely
into
her
room
and
gave
it
a
brief
survey
there
were
some
personal
odds
and
ends
she
would
have
liked
to
take
with
her
but
she
could
send
for
them
from
manon
the
denton
however
was
coming
along
the
little
gun
had
a
very
precisely
calibrated
stunner
attachment
and
old
runser
argee
had
instructed
trigger
in
its
use
with
his
customary
thoroughness
before
he
formally
presented
her
with
the
gun
she
had
never
had
occasion
to
turn
the
stunner
on
a
human
being
but
she
used
it
on
game
if
this
cloak
and
dagger
business
became
too
realistic
already
decided
she
would
use
it
as
needed
she
slipped
the
denton
into
the
side
pocket
of
a
lightweight
rain
robe
draped
the
robe
over
her
arm
slung
her
purse
beside
it
picked
up
the
sun
hat
and
left
the
room
the
colonial
school
kitchen
area
was
on
one
of
the
underground
levels
unless
they
modified
their
guard
system
very
considerably
since
trigger
had
graduated
that
was
the
route
by
which
she
would
leave
as
far
as
she
could
tell
they
had
modified
anything
the
whole
kitchen
level
looked
so
unchanged
that
she
had
a
moment
of
nostalgia
groups
of
students
went
chattering
along
the
hallways
between
the
storerooms
and
the
cooking
and
processing
plants
the
big
mess
hall
trigger
noticed
in
passing
smelled
as
good
as
it
always
had
bells
sounded
the
end
of
a
period
and
a
loudspeaker
system
began
directing
class
so
and
so
to
room
such
and
such
standing
around
were
a
few
uniformed
guards
mainly
for
the
purpose
of
helping
out
newcomers
who
had
lost
their
direction
she
came
out
on
the
equally
familiar
big
and
brightly
lit
platform
of
the
loading
ramp
some
sixty
or
seventy
great
cylindrical
vans
floated
alongside
the
platform
most
of
them
disgorging
their
contents
some
still
sealed
trigger
walked
unhurriedly
down
the
ramp
staying
in
the
background
observing
the
movements
of
two
ramp
guards
and
marking
four
vans
which
were
empty
and
looked
ready
to
go
the
driver
of
the
farthest
of
the
four
empties
stood
in
the
back
of
his
vehicle
a
few
feet
above
the
platform
when
trigger
came
level
with
him
he
was
studying
her
he
was
a
big
young
man
with
tousled
black
hair
and
a
look
he
was
grinning
very
faintly
he
knew
the
ways
of
colonial
school
students
trigger
raised
her
left
hand
a
few
inches
three
fingers
up
his
grin
widened
he
shook
his
head
and
raised
both
hands
in
a
corresponding
gesture
eight
fingers
trigger
frowned
at
him
stopped
and
looked
back
along
the
row
of
vans
then
left
hand
up
again
four
fingers
and
thumb
the
driver
made
a
circle
with
finger
and
thumb
a
deal
for
five
maccadon
crowns
which
was
about
standard
fare
for
unauthorized
passage
out
of
the
school
trigger
wandered
on
to
the
end
of
the
platform
turned
and
came
back
still
unhurriedly
but
now
close
to
the
edge
of
the
ramp
down
the
line
another
van
slammed
open
in
back
and
a
stream
of
crates
swooped
out
riding
a
gravity
beam
from
the
roof
toward
a
waiting
storeroom
carrier
the
guard
closest
to
trigger
turned
to
watch
the
process
trigger
took
six
quick
steps
and
reached
her
driver
he
put
down
a
hand
to
help
her
step
up
she
slipped
the
piece
into
his
palm
up
front
he
whispered
hoarsely
next
to
the
driver
seat
and
keep
down
how
far
nearest
tube
line
he
grinned
again
and
nodded
can
do
twenty
minutes
later
trigger
was
in
a
downtown
comweb
booth
there
had
been
a
minor
modification
in
her
plans
and
she
stopped
off
in
a
store
a
few
doors
away
and
picked
up
a
carefully
nondescript
street
dress
and
a
scarf
she
changed
into
the
dress
now
and
bundled
the
school
costume
into
a
deposit
box
which
she
dispatched
to
central
deposit
with
a
piece
getting
a
numbered
slip
in
return
it
had
occurred
to
her
that
there
was
a
chance
otherwise
of
getting
caught
in
a
colonial
school
roundup
if
it
was
brought
to
doctor
plemponi
attention
that
there
appeared
to
be
considerably
more
students
out
on
the
town
at
the
moment
than
could
be
properly
overlooked
or
even
trigger
thought
if
somebody
simply
happened
to
have
missed
trigger
argee
she
slipped
the
rain
robe
over
her
shoulders
dropped
a
coin
into
the
comweb
and
covered
the
hair
with
the
scarf
the
screen
lit
up
she
asked
for
grand
commerce
transportation
waiting
she
realized
suddenly
that
so
far
she
was
rather
enjoying
herself
there
had
been
a
little
argument
with
the
van
driver
who
it
turned
out
had
ideas
of
his
own
about
modifying
trigger
plans
a
complication
she
run
into
frequently
in
her
school
days
too
as
usual
it
did
develop
into
a
very
serious
argument
truckers
who
dealt
with
the
colonial
school
knew
or
learned
in
one
or
two
briefly
horrid
lessons
that
mihul
charges
were
prone
to
ungirlish
methods
of
discouragement
when
argued
with
too
urgently
the
view
screen
switched
on
the
transportation
clerk
glance
flicked
over
trigger
street
dress
when
she
told
him
her
destination
his
expression
remained
bland
yes
the
dawn
city
was
leaving
ceyce
port
for
the
manon
system
tomorrow
evening
yes
it
was
subspace
express
one
of
the
newest
and
fastest
in
fact
his
eyes
slipped
over
the
dress
again
also
one
of
the
most
luxurious
he
might
add
there
would
be
only
two
stops
in
the
hub
beyond
maccadon
one
each
off
evalee
and
garth
then
a
straight
dive
to
manon
unless
of
course
gravitic
storm
shifts
forced
the
ship
to
surface
temporarily
average
time
for
the
dawn
city
on
the
run
was
eleven
days
the
slowest
trip
so
far
had
required
sixteen
but
unfortunately
madam
there
are
only
a
very
few
cabins
left
and
not
very
desirable
ones
i
afraid
he
looked
apologetic
there
has
been
a
vacancy
on
the
manon
run
for
the
past
three
months
i
can
stand
it
i
imagine
trigger
said
how
much
for
the
cheapest
the
clerk
cleared
his
throat
gently
and
told
her
she
could
help
blinking
though
she
was
braced
for
it
but
it
was
more
than
she
had
counted
on
a
great
deal
more
it
would
leave
her
in
fact
with
exactly
one
hundred
and
crowns
out
of
her
entire
savings
plus
the
coins
she
had
in
her
purse
any
extras
she
asked
a
little
hoarsely
he
shrugged
there
traveler
rest
he
said
negligently
nine
hundred
for
the
three
dive
periods
but
rest
is
optional
of
course
some
passengers
prefer
the
experience
of
staying
awake
during
a
subspace
dive
he
smiled
rather
sadistically
trigger
felt
and
added
till
they
lived
through
one
of
them
that
is
trigger
nodded
she
lived
through
quite
a
few
of
them
she
did
like
subspace
particularly
nobody
did
but
except
for
an
occasional
touch
of
nausea
or
dizziness
at
the
beginning
of
a
dive
it
did
bother
her
much
many
people
got
hallucinations
went
into
states
of
panic
or
just
got
very
sick
anything
else
she
asked
just
the
usual
tips
and
things
said
the
clerk
he
looked
surprised
do
you
does
madam
wish
to
make
the
reservation
madam
does
trigger
told
him
coldly
how
long
will
it
hold
it
would
be
good
up
to
an
hour
before
time
she
learned
if
not
claimed
then
it
would
be
filled
from
the
waiting
list
she
left
the
booth
thoughtfully
at
least
the
dawn
city
would
be
leaving
in
less
than
hours
she
would
have
to
spend
much
of
her
remaining
capital
before
she
got
off
maccadon
she
skip
meals
she
decided
except
breakfast
next
morning
which
would
be
covered
by
her
hotel
room
fee
and
it
was
going
to
be
any
hotel
there
was
no
one
obviously
waiting
for
her
at
the
bank
of
maccadon
in
fact
since
that
venerable
institution
covered
a
city
block
with
entrances
running
up
from
the
street
level
to
the
floor
a
small
army
would
have
been
needed
to
make
sure
of
spotting
her
she
had
to
identify
herself
to
get
into
the
vaults
but
there
was
a
solution
to
that
seven
years
ago
when
runser
argee
died
suddenly
and
she
had
to
get
his
property
and
records
straightened
out
a
little
vault
attendant
with
whom
she
dealt
with
had
taken
a
fatherly
interest
in
her
when
she
saw
he
was
still
on
the
job
trigger
was
certain
the
matter
would
go
off
all
right
it
did
he
did
take
a
really
close
look
at
her
until
she
shoved
her
signature
and
federation
identification
in
front
of
him
then
his
head
bobbed
up
briskly
his
eyes
lit
up
trigger
he
bounced
out
of
his
chair
his
right
hand
shot
out
good
to
see
you
again
i
been
hearing
about
you
they
shook
hands
she
put
a
finger
to
her
lips
i
here
incog
she
cautioned
in
a
low
voice
can
you
handle
this
quietly
the
faded
blue
eyes
widened
slightly
but
he
asked
no
questions
trigger
argee
name
was
known
rather
widely
as
a
matter
of
fact
particularly
on
her
home
world
and
as
he
remembered
trigger
she
was
a
girl
go
look
for
a
spotlight
to
stand
in
he
nodded
sure
can
he
glanced
suspiciously
at
the
nearest
customers
then
looked
down
at
what
trigger
had
written
he
frowned
you
drawing
out
everything
not
leaving
ceyce
for
good
are
you
no
trigger
said
i
be
back
this
is
just
a
temporary
emergency
that
was
all
the
explaining
she
had
to
do
four
minutes
later
she
had
her
money
three
minutes
after
that
she
had
paid
for
the
dawn
city
reservation
as
birna
drellgannoth
and
deposited
her
thumbprints
with
the
ticket
office
counting
what
was
left
she
found
it
came
to
just
under
a
hundred
and
definitely
no
dinner
tonight
she
needed
a
suitcase
and
a
change
of
clothing
and
then
she
just
better
go
sit
in
that
hotel
room
the
street
level
traffic
was
moderate
around
the
bank
but
it
began
to
thicken
as
she
approached
a
shopping
center
two
blocks
farther
on
striding
along
neither
hurrying
nor
idling
trigger
decided
she
had
it
made
the
only
real
chance
to
catch
up
with
her
had
been
at
the
bank
and
the
old
vault
attendant
would
talk
half
a
block
from
the
shopping
center
a
row
of
spacers
on
came
rollicking
cheerily
toward
her
uniform
jackets
unbuttoned
three
ceyce
girls
in
formation
among
them
all
happily
high
trigger
shifted
toward
the
edge
of
the
sidewalk
to
let
them
pass
as
the
line
swayed
up
on
her
left
there
was
a
shadowy
settling
of
an
aircar
at
the
curb
to
her
right
with
loud
outcries
of
glad
recognition
and
whoops
of
laughter
the
line
swung
in
about
her
close
bodies
crowded
against
her
a
hand
was
clapped
over
her
mouth
other
hands
held
her
arms
her
feet
came
off
the
ground
and
she
had
a
momentary
awareness
of
being
rushed
expertly
forward
then
she
was
in
the
car
half
on
her
side
over
the
rear
seat
two
very
strong
hands
clamping
her
wrists
together
behind
her
back
as
she
sucked
in
her
breath
for
a
yell
the
door
snapped
shut
behind
her
cutting
off
the
rollicking
and
other
noises
outside
there
was
a
lurching
twist
as
the
aircar
shot
upward
the
man
who
held
trigger
wrists
shifted
his
grip
up
her
arms
and
turned
her
a
little
so
that
she
could
sit
upright
on
the
seat
faced
half
away
from
him
she
had
got
only
a
glimpse
of
him
as
he
caught
her
but
he
seemed
to
be
wearing
the
same
kind
of
commercial
spacer
uniform
as
the
group
which
had
hustled
her
into
the
car
the
other
man
in
the
car
the
driver
sat
up
front
with
his
back
to
them
he
looked
like
any
ordinary
civilian
trigger
let
her
breath
out
slowly
there
was
no
point
in
yelling
now
she
could
feel
her
legs
tremble
a
little
but
she
did
seem
to
be
actually
frightened
at
least
not
yet
spot
anything
so
far
the
man
who
held
her
asked
it
was
a
deep
voice
it
sounded
quite
unexcited
three
possibles
anyway
the
driver
said
with
equal
casualness
he
did
turn
his
head
make
it
two
one
very
definite
possible
now
i
say
better
feed
it
to
her
then
the
driver
did
reply
but
the
car
renewed
surge
of
power
pushed
trigger
down
hard
on
the
seat
she
could
see
much
more
than
a
shifting
piece
of
the
sky
line
through
the
front
view
plate
their
own
car
seemed
to
be
rising
at
a
tremendous
rate
they
were
probably
she
thought
already
above
the
main
traffic
arteries
over
ceyce
now
miss
argee
the
man
sitting
beside
her
said
i
like
to
reassure
you
a
little
first
go
ahead
and
reassure
me
trigger
said
unsteadily
you
in
no
slightest
danger
from
us
he
said
we
your
friends
nice
friends
remarked
trigger
i
explain
it
all
in
a
couple
of
minutes
there
may
be
some
fairly
dangerous
characters
on
our
tail
at
the
moment
and
if
they
start
to
catch
up
which
they
seem
to
be
doing
the
driver
interrupted
hang
on
for
a
few
fast
turns
when
we
hit
the
next
cloud
bank
we
probably
shake
them
there
the
other
man
explained
to
trigger
in
case
we
do
though
i
need
both
hands
free
to
handle
the
guns
so
she
asked
so
i
like
to
slip
a
set
of
cuffs
on
you
for
just
a
few
minutes
been
informed
you
a
fairly
tricky
lady
and
we
do
want
you
to
do
anything
thoughtless
you
wo
have
them
on
very
long
all
right
trigger
bit
her
lip
it
was
all
right
and
she
did
feel
at
all
reassured
so
far
go
ahead
she
said
he
let
go
of
her
left
arm
presumably
to
reach
for
the
handcuffs
she
twisted
around
on
him
and
went
into
fast
action
she
was
fairly
proficient
at
the
practice
of
unarmed
mayhem
the
trouble
was
that
the
big
ape
she
was
trying
the
stuff
on
seemed
at
least
as
adept
and
with
twice
her
muscle
she
lost
a
precious
instant
finding
out
that
the
denton
was
no
longer
in
her
robe
pocket
after
that
she
never
got
back
the
initiative
it
did
help
either
that
the
car
suddenly
seemed
to
be
trying
to
fly
in
three
directions
at
once
all
in
all
about
forty
seconds
passed
before
she
was
plumped
back
on
the
seat
her
hands
behind
her
again
linked
at
the
wrists
by
the
smooth
plastic
cords
of
the
cuffs
the
ape
stood
behind
the
driver
his
hands
resting
on
the
back
of
the
seat
he
was
trigger
observed
bitterly
even
breathing
hard
the
view
plate
was
full
of
the
cottony
whiteness
of
a
cloud
heart
they
seemed
to
be
dropping
again
one
more
violent
swerve
and
they
came
flashing
out
into
wet
gray
and
on
into
brilliant
sunlight
a
few
seconds
passed
then
the
ape
remarked
looks
like
you
lost
them
chum
right
said
the
driver
almost
at
the
river
now
i
turn
north
there
and
drop
down
right
said
the
ape
get
us
that
far
and
we
be
out
of
trouble
a
few
minutes
passed
in
silence
presently
trigger
sensed
they
were
slowing
and
losing
altitude
then
a
line
of
trees
flashed
by
in
the
view
plate
nice
flying
the
ape
said
he
punched
the
driver
approvingly
in
the
shoulder
and
turned
back
to
trigger
they
looked
at
each
other
for
a
few
seconds
he
was
tall
very
deeply
tanned
with
thick
sloping
shoulders
he
probably
more
than
five
or
six
years
older
than
she
was
he
was
studying
her
curiously
and
his
eyes
were
remarkably
steady
something
stirred
in
her
for
a
moment
a
small
chill
of
fear
something
passed
through
her
thoughts
a
vague
odd
impression
like
a
half
aroused
memory
of
huge
cold
dangerous
things
far
away
it
was
gone
before
she
could
grasp
it
more
clearly
she
frowned
the
ape
smiled
it
was
trigger
saw
an
entirely
unpleasant
face
sorry
the
party
got
rough
he
said
will
you
give
parole
if
i
take
those
cuffs
off
and
tell
you
what
this
is
about
she
studied
him
again
better
tell
me
first
she
said
shortly
all
right
we
taking
you
to
commissioner
tate
we
be
there
in
about
an
hour
he
tell
you
himself
why
he
wanted
to
see
you
trigger
eyes
narrowed
for
an
instant
secretly
she
felt
very
much
relieved
holati
tate
at
any
rate
would
let
anything
really
unpleasant
happen
to
her
and
she
would
find
out
at
last
what
had
been
going
on
you
got
an
odd
way
of
taking
people
places
she
observed
he
laughed
the
grabber
party
was
scheduled
you
indicated
you
wanted
to
speak
to
the
commissioner
we
were
sent
to
the
colonial
school
to
pick
you
up
and
escort
you
to
him
when
we
found
out
disappeared
we
had
to
do
some
fast
improvising
not
my
business
to
tell
you
the
reasons
for
that
trigger
said
hesitantly
those
people
who
were
chasing
this
car
what
about
them
he
asked
thoughtfully
were
they
after
well
he
said
they
were
after
me
better
let
the
commissioner
tell
you
about
that
too
now
how
about
parole
she
nodded
till
you
turn
me
over
to
the
commissioner
fair
enough
he
said
you
his
problem
then
he
took
a
small
flat
piece
of
metal
out
of
a
pocket
and
reached
back
of
her
with
it
he
did
seem
to
do
more
than
touch
the
cuffs
but
she
felt
the
slick
coils
loosen
and
drop
away
trigger
rubbed
her
wrists
where
my
gun
she
asked
i
got
it
i
give
it
to
the
commissioner
how
did
you
people
find
me
so
fast
police
keep
bank
entrances
under
hour
visual
survey
we
had
someone
watching
their
screens
you
were
spotted
going
in
he
sat
down
companionably
beside
her
i
introduce
myself
but
i
do
know
if
that
would
fit
in
with
the
commissioner
plans
trigger
shrugged
it
still
was
quite
possible
she
decided
that
her
own
plans
were
completely
spoiled
holati
and
his
friends
necessarily
know
about
that
vault
account
if
they
did
know
she
had
one
and
had
closed
it
out
they
could
make
a
pretty
good
guess
at
what
she
done
with
the
money
but
if
she
just
kept
quiet
there
might
be
an
opportunity
to
get
back
to
ceyce
and
the
dawn
city
by
tomorrow
evening
cigarette
the
commissioner
overmuscled
henchman
inquired
amiably
trigger
glanced
at
him
from
the
side
not
amiably
no
thanks
no
hard
feelings
are
there
he
looked
surprised
yes
she
said
evenly
there
are
maybe
the
driver
suggested
from
the
front
what
miss
argee
could
do
with
is
a
shot
of
puya
flask
in
my
coat
pocket
left
side
there
an
idea
remarked
trigger
companion
he
looked
at
her
very
good
puya
so
choke
on
it
trigger
told
him
gently
she
settled
back
into
the
corner
of
the
seat
and
closed
her
eyes
you
can
wake
me
up
when
we
get
to
the
commissioner
in
some
way
holati
tate
said
this
little
item
here
seems
to
be
at
the
core
of
the
whole
plasmoid
problem
know
what
it
is
trigger
looked
at
the
little
item
with
some
revulsion
dark
green
marbled
with
pink
streakings
it
lay
on
the
table
between
them
rather
like
a
plump
leech
a
foot
and
a
half
long
it
was
motionless
except
that
the
end
nearest
her
shifted
in
a
short
arc
from
side
to
side
as
if
the
thing
suffered
from
a
very
slow
twitch
one
of
the
plasmoids
obviously
she
said
a
jumpy
one
she
blinked
at
it
looks
like
that
is
it
she
glanced
around
commissioner
tate
and
professor
mantelish
who
sat
in
an
armchair
off
to
her
right
were
staring
at
her
eyebrows
up
apparently
surprised
about
something
what
the
matter
she
asked
we
just
wondering
said
holati
how
you
happen
to
remember
in
particular
out
of
the
thousands
of
plasmoids
on
harvest
moon
oh
one
of
the
junior
scientists
on
your
project
mentioned
the
unit
that
brought
it
to
mind
is
this
no
said
holati
tate
but
it
appears
to
be
a
duplicate
of
it
he
was
a
little
man
well
along
in
years
sparse
and
spruce
in
his
precol
uniform
the
small
gray
eyes
in
the
leathery
face
were
really
mild
if
you
considered
them
more
closely
or
if
you
knew
the
commissioner
have
to
fill
you
in
on
some
of
the
background
first
trigger
girl
he
said
when
she
was
brought
to
his
little
private
office
and
inquired
with
some
heat
what
the
devil
was
up
the
tall
grabber
come
into
the
office
with
her
he
asked
the
commissioner
from
the
door
whether
he
should
get
professor
mantelish
to
the
conference
room
and
the
commissioner
nodded
then
the
door
closed
and
the
two
of
them
were
alone
i
know
it
looked
odd
commissioner
tate
admitted
but
the
circumstances
have
been
very
odd
still
are
and
i
did
want
to
worry
you
any
more
than
i
had
to
trigger
unmollified
pointed
out
that
the
methods
he
used
not
to
worry
her
hardly
had
been
soothing
i
know
that
too
said
the
commissioner
but
if
i
told
you
everything
immediately
you
would
have
had
reason
enough
to
be
worried
for
the
past
two
months
rather
than
just
for
a
day
or
so
the
situation
has
improved
now
very
considerably
in
fact
in
another
few
days
you
should
have
any
more
reason
to
worry
at
all
he
smiled
briefly
at
least
no
more
than
the
rest
of
us
trigger
felt
a
bit
suddenly
i
do
at
present
she
asked
you
did
till
today
there
been
some
pretty
heavy
heat
on
you
trigger
girl
we
switching
most
of
it
off
tonight
for
good
i
think
you
mean
some
heat
will
be
left
in
a
way
he
said
but
that
should
be
cleared
up
too
in
the
next
three
or
four
days
anyway
we
can
drop
most
of
the
mystery
act
tonight
trigger
shook
her
head
it
is
being
dropped
very
fast
she
observed
i
told
you
i
could
tell
it
backwards
the
commissioner
said
patiently
all
right
if
we
start
filling
in
the
background
now
i
guess
we
better
she
admitted
fine
said
commissioner
tate
he
got
to
his
feet
then
let
go
join
mantelish
why
the
professor
he
could
help
a
lot
with
the
explaining
if
he
in
the
mood
anyway
he
got
a
kind
of
pet
i
like
you
to
look
at
a
pet
cried
trigger
she
shook
her
head
again
and
stood
up
resignedly
lead
on
commissioner
they
joined
mantelish
and
his
plasmoid
weirdie
in
what
looked
like
the
dining
room
of
what
had
looked
like
an
hunting
lodge
when
the
aircar
came
diving
down
on
it
between
two
mountain
peaks
trigger
was
sure
in
just
what
section
of
the
main
continent
they
were
but
there
were
only
two
or
three
alternatives
it
was
high
in
the
mountains
and
night
came
a
lot
faster
here
than
it
did
around
ceyce
she
greeted
mantelish
and
sat
down
at
the
table
then
the
commissioner
locked
the
doors
and
introduced
her
to
the
professor
pet
it
labelled
he
said
now
even
the
professor
is
certain
he
could
distinguish
between
the
two
right
mantelish
that
is
true
said
mantelish
at
present
he
was
a
very
big
rather
fat
but
old
man
with
a
thick
thatch
of
white
hair
and
a
ruddy
face
without
a
physical
comparison
he
shrugged
what
so
important
about
the
critter
trigger
asked
eyeing
the
leech
again
one
good
thing
about
it
she
thought
it
was
equipped
to
eye
her
back
it
goes
back
to
the
time
the
commissioner
said
when
mantelish
and
fayle
and
azol
were
conducting
the
first
league
investigation
of
the
plasmoids
on
harvest
moon
you
recall
the
situation
if
you
mean
their
attempts
to
get
the
things
to
show
some
signs
of
life
i
do
naturally
one
of
them
got
lively
enough
for
poor
old
azol
did
it
professor
mantelish
rumbled
from
his
armchair
trigger
grimaced
doctor
azol
fate
might
be
one
of
the
things
that
had
given
her
a
negative
attitude
towards
plasmoids
with
mantelish
and
doctor
gess
fayle
azol
had
been
the
third
of
the
three
big
boys
in
charge
of
the
initial
investigation
on
harvest
moon
as
she
remembered
it
it
was
azol
who
discovered
that
plasmoids
occasionally
could
be
induced
to
absorb
food
almost
any
kind
of
food
it
turned
out
so
long
as
it
contained
a
sufficient
quantity
of
protein
what
had
happened
to
azol
looked
like
a
particularly
unfortunate
result
of
the
discovery
it
was
assumed
an
untimely
coronary
had
been
the
reason
he
had
fallen
helplessly
into
the
feeding
trough
of
one
of
the
largest
plasmoids
by
the
time
he
was
found
all
of
him
from
the
knees
on
up
already
had
been
absorbed
i
meant
your
efforts
to
get
them
to
work
she
said
commissioner
tate
looked
at
mantelish
you
tell
her
about
that
part
of
it
he
suggested
mantelish
shook
his
head
i
get
too
technical
he
said
resignedly
i
always
do
at
least
they
say
so
you
tell
her
but
holati
tate
eyes
had
shifted
suddenly
to
the
table
hey
now
he
said
in
a
low
voice
trigger
followed
his
gaze
after
a
moment
she
made
a
soft
sucking
sound
of
alarmed
distaste
ugh
she
remarked
it
moving
so
it
is
holati
said
towards
me
said
trigger
i
think
do
get
startled
mantelish
mantelish
already
was
coming
up
slowly
behind
trigger
chair
move
he
cautioned
her
why
not
said
trigger
hush
my
dear
mantelish
laid
a
large
heavy
hand
on
each
of
her
shoulders
and
bore
down
slightly
it
sensitive
this
is
very
interesting
very
perhaps
it
was
she
kept
watching
the
plasmoid
it
had
thinned
out
somewhat
and
was
gliding
very
slowly
but
very
steadily
across
the
table
definitely
in
her
direction
said
mantelish
in
a
thunderous
murmur
perhaps
it
likes
you
trigger
he
seemed
immensely
pleased
well
trigger
said
helplessly
i
do
like
it
she
wriggled
slightly
under
mantelish
hands
and
i
sooner
get
out
of
this
chair
do
be
childish
trigger
said
the
professor
annoyedly
behaving
as
if
it
were
in
some
manner
offensive
it
is
she
said
hush
my
dear
mantelish
said
absently
putting
on
a
little
more
pressure
trigger
hushed
resignedly
they
watched
in
about
a
minute
the
gliding
thing
reached
the
edge
of
the
table
trigger
gathered
herself
to
duck
out
from
under
mantelish
hands
and
go
flying
out
of
the
chair
if
it
looked
as
if
the
plasmoid
was
about
to
drop
into
her
lap
but
it
stopped
for
a
few
seconds
it
lay
motionless
then
it
gradually
raised
its
front
end
and
began
waving
it
gently
back
and
forth
in
the
air
at
her
trigger
suspected
yipes
she
said
horrified
the
front
end
sank
back
the
plasmoid
lay
still
again
after
a
minute
it
was
still
lying
still
show
over
for
the
moment
i
guess
said
the
commissioner
i
afraid
so
said
professor
mantelish
his
big
hands
went
away
from
trigger
aching
shoulders
you
startled
it
trigger
he
boomed
at
her
accusingly
the
point
of
it
holati
tate
explained
was
that
this
had
been
more
activity
than
normally
displayed
over
a
period
of
a
week
and
was
easily
the
most
active
plasmoid
of
them
all
nowadays
it
is
of
course
possible
mantelish
said
arousing
from
deep
thought
that
it
was
attracted
by
your
body
odor
thank
you
mantelish
said
trigger
you
welcome
my
dear
mantelish
had
pulled
his
chair
up
to
the
table
he
hitched
himself
forward
in
it
we
shall
now
he
announced
try
a
little
experiment
pick
it
up
trigger
she
stared
at
him
pick
it
up
no
mantelish
we
shall
now
try
some
other
little
experiment
mantelish
furrowed
his
jovian
brows
holati
gave
her
a
small
smile
across
the
table
just
touch
it
with
the
tip
of
a
finger
he
suggested
you
can
do
that
much
for
the
professor
ca
you
barely
trigger
told
him
grimly
but
she
reached
out
and
put
a
cautious
finger
tip
to
the
less
lively
end
of
after
a
moment
she
said
hey
she
moved
the
finger
lightly
along
the
thing
surface
it
had
a
velvety
smooth
warm
feeling
rather
like
a
kitten
you
know
she
said
surprised
it
feels
sort
of
nice
it
just
looks
disgusting
disgusting
mantelish
boomed
offended
again
the
commissioner
held
up
a
hand
just
a
moment
he
said
he
picked
up
some
signal
trigger
had
noticed
for
he
went
over
to
the
wall
now
and
touched
something
there
a
release
button
apparently
the
door
to
the
room
opened
trigger
grabber
came
in
the
door
closed
behind
him
he
was
carrying
a
tray
with
a
squat
brown
flask
and
four
rather
small
glasses
on
it
he
gave
trigger
a
grin
she
gave
him
a
tentative
smile
in
return
the
commissioner
had
introduced
him
heslet
quillan
major
heslet
quillan
of
the
subspace
engineers
for
a
subspace
engineer
trigger
had
thought
skeptically
he
was
a
pretty
good
grabber
but
there
was
a
qualified
truce
in
the
room
it
would
last
at
least
until
holati
finished
his
explaining
there
was
no
really
good
reason
not
to
include
major
quillan
in
it
ah
puya
professor
mantelish
exclaimed
advancing
on
the
tray
as
quillan
set
it
on
the
table
mantelish
seemed
to
have
forgotten
about
plasmoid
experiments
for
the
moment
and
trigger
did
intend
to
remind
him
she
drew
her
hand
back
quietly
from
the
professor
unstoppered
the
flask
you
have
some
trigger
i
sure
the
only
really
good
thing
the
benighted
world
of
rumli
ever
produced
my
trigger
remarked
was
a
rumlian
she
watched
him
fill
the
four
glasses
with
a
thin
purple
liquid
i
never
tried
it
but
yes
thanks
quillan
put
one
of
the
glasses
in
front
of
her
and
we
shall
drink
mantelish
suggested
with
a
suave
flourish
of
his
puya
to
your
we
shall
also
suggested
major
quillan
pulling
a
chair
up
to
the
table
for
himself
advise
trigger
to
take
a
very
small
sip
on
her
first
go
at
the
stuff
nobody
had
invited
him
to
sit
down
but
nobody
was
objecting
either
well
that
fitted
trigger
thought
she
sipped
it
was
tart
and
hot
very
hot
she
set
the
glass
back
on
the
table
inhaled
with
difficulty
exhaled
quiveringly
tears
gathered
in
her
eyes
very
good
she
husked
very
good
the
commissioner
agreed
he
put
down
his
empty
glass
and
smacked
his
lips
lightly
and
now
he
said
briskly
let
get
on
with
this
conference
trigger
glanced
around
the
room
while
quillan
refilled
three
glasses
the
small
live
coal
she
had
swallowed
was
melting
away
a
warm
glow
began
to
spread
through
her
it
did
look
like
the
dining
room
of
a
hunting
lodge
the
woodwork
was
dark
worn
with
much
polishing
horned
heads
of
various
formidable
maccadon
adorned
the
walls
but
it
was
open
season
now
on
a
different
kind
of
game
three
men
had
walked
briskly
past
them
when
quillan
brought
her
in
by
the
front
door
they
had
even
looked
at
her
there
were
sounds
now
and
then
from
some
of
the
other
rooms
and
that
general
feeling
of
a
considerable
number
of
people
around
of
being
at
an
operating
headquarters
of
some
sort
which
hummed
with
quiet
activity
one
of
the
things
holati
tate
said
which
had
not
become
public
knowledge
so
far
was
that
professor
mantelish
actually
succeeded
in
getting
some
of
the
plasmoids
on
the
old
galactic
base
back
into
operation
one
plasmoid
in
particular
the
reason
the
achievement
had
been
announced
was
that
for
nearly
six
weeks
no
one
except
the
three
men
directly
involved
in
the
experiments
had
known
about
them
and
during
that
time
other
things
occurred
which
made
subsequent
publicity
seem
very
inadvisable
mantelish
scowled
we
made
up
a
report
to
the
league
the
day
of
the
initial
discovery
he
informed
trigger
it
was
a
complete
and
detailed
report
true
holati
said
but
the
report
the
got
did
happen
to
be
the
one
professor
mantelish
helped
make
up
we
go
into
that
later
the
plasmoid
the
professor
was
experimenting
with
was
the
unit
he
shifted
his
gaze
to
mantelish
still
want
me
to
tell
it
yes
yes
mantelish
said
impatiently
you
will
oversimplify
grossly
of
course
but
it
should
do
for
the
moment
at
a
more
leisurely
time
i
shall
be
glad
to
give
trigger
an
accurate
description
of
the
processes
trigger
smiled
at
him
thank
you
professor
she
took
her
second
sip
of
the
puya
not
bad
well
mantelish
was
dosing
this
plasmoid
with
mild
electrical
stimulations
holati
went
on
he
noticed
suddenly
that
as
he
did
it
other
plasmoids
in
that
section
of
harvest
moon
were
indicating
signs
of
activity
so
he
called
in
doctor
fayle
and
doctor
azol
the
three
scientists
discovered
quickly
that
stimulation
of
the
part
of
the
unit
was
in
fact
producing
random
patterns
of
plasmoid
motion
throughout
the
entire
base
while
an
electrical
prod
at
brought
everything
to
an
abrupt
stop
again
after
a
few
hours
of
this
suddenly
extruded
a
section
of
its
material
which
detached
itself
and
moved
off
slowly
under
its
own
power
through
half
the
station
trailed
with
great
excitement
by
mantelish
and
azol
it
stopped
at
a
point
where
another
plasmoid
had
been
removed
for
laboratory
investigations
climbed
up
and
settled
down
in
the
place
left
vacant
by
its
predecessor
it
then
reshaped
itself
into
a
copy
of
the
predecessor
and
remained
where
it
was
obviously
a
replacement
there
was
dignified
scientific
jubilation
among
the
three
this
was
precisely
the
kind
of
information
the
and
everybody
else
had
been
hoping
to
obtain
tentatively
could
be
assumed
to
be
a
kind
of
monitor
of
the
station
activities
it
could
be
induced
to
go
into
action
and
to
activate
the
other
plasmoids
with
further
observation
and
refinement
of
method
its
action
undoubtedly
could
be
shifted
from
the
random
to
the
purposeful
finally
and
most
importantly
it
had
shown
itself
capable
of
producing
a
different
form
of
plasmoid
life
to
fulfill
a
specific
requirement
in
essence
the
riddles
presented
by
the
old
galactic
station
appeared
to
be
solved
the
three
made
up
their
secret
report
to
the
included
was
a
recommendation
to
authorize
distribution
of
ten
per
cent
of
the
less
significant
plasmoids
to
various
experimental
centers
in
the
hub
the
big
and
important
centers
which
had
been
bringing
heavy
political
pressure
to
bear
on
the
federation
to
let
them
in
on
the
investigation
that
should
keep
them
occupied
while
the
concluded
the
really
important
work
next
day
said
holati
doctor
gess
fayle
presented
mantelish
with
a
transmitted
message
from
headquarters
it
contained
instructions
to
have
fayle
mount
the
unit
immediately
in
one
of
the
league
ships
at
harvest
moon
and
bring
it
quietly
to
maccadon
mantelish
frowned
the
message
was
faked
he
boomed
not
only
that
said
holati
the
actual
report
doctor
fayle
had
transmitted
the
day
before
to
the
league
was
revised
to
the
extent
that
it
omitted
any
reference
to
he
glanced
thoughtfully
at
mantelish
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
almost
a
month
and
a
half
before
league
headquarters
became
aware
of
the
importance
of
the
unit
the
professor
snorted
azol
he
explained
to
trigger
had
become
a
victim
of
his
scientific
zeal
and
i
doctor
azol
said
the
commissioner
as
you
may
remember
had
his
little
mishap
with
the
plasmoid
just
two
days
after
fayle
departed
and
i
mantelish
went
on
was
involved
in
other
urgent
research
how
was
i
to
know
what
that
villain
fayle
had
been
up
to
a
vice
president
of
the
university
league
well
trigger
said
what
had
doctor
fayle
been
up
to
we
do
know
yet
holati
told
her
obviously
he
had
something
in
mind
with
the
faked
order
and
the
alteration
of
the
report
but
the
only
thing
we
can
say
definitely
is
that
he
disappeared
on
the
league
ship
he
had
requisitioned
along
with
its
personnel
and
the
plasmoid
and
has
shown
up
again
and
that
plasmoid
unit
now
appears
to
have
been
almost
certainly
the
key
unit
of
the
entire
old
galactic
station
the
unit
that
kept
everything
running
along
automatically
there
for
thirty
thousand
years
he
glanced
at
quillan
someone
at
the
door
we
hold
it
while
you
see
what
they
want
the
burly
character
who
had
appeared
at
the
door
said
diffidently
that
professor
mantelish
had
wanted
to
be
present
while
his
lab
equipment
was
stowed
aboard
if
the
professor
did
mind
things
were
about
that
far
along
mantelish
excused
himself
and
went
off
with
the
messenger
the
door
closed
quillan
came
back
to
his
chair
we
moving
the
outfit
later
tonight
the
commissioner
explained
mantelish
is
coming
along
plus
around
eight
tons
of
his
lab
equipment
plus
his
special
guards
oh
trigger
picked
up
the
puya
glass
she
looked
into
it
it
was
empty
moving
where
she
asked
manon
said
the
commissioner
tell
you
about
that
later
every
last
muscle
in
trigger
body
seemed
to
go
limp
simultaneously
she
settled
back
slightly
in
the
chair
surprised
by
the
force
of
the
reaction
she
had
realized
by
now
how
keyed
up
she
was
she
sighed
a
small
sigh
then
she
smiled
at
quillan
major
she
said
how
about
a
tiny
little
refill
on
that
puya
about
half
quillan
took
care
of
the
tiny
little
refill
commissioner
tate
said
by
the
way
quillan
does
have
a
degree
in
subspace
engineering
and
gets
assigned
to
the
engineers
now
and
then
but
his
real
job
space
scout
intelligence
trigger
nodded
i
almost
guessed
it
she
gave
quillan
another
smile
she
nearly
gave
a
smile
and
now
said
the
commissioner
we
talk
more
freely
we
tell
mantelish
just
as
little
as
we
can
to
tell
you
the
truth
trigger
the
professor
is
a
terrible
handicap
on
an
operation
like
this
i
understand
he
was
a
great
friend
of
your
father
yes
she
said
going
over
for
visits
to
mantelish
garden
with
my
father
is
one
of
the
earliest
things
i
remember
i
can
imagine
he
a
problem
she
shifted
her
gaze
curiously
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
two
men
what
are
you
people
doing
looking
for
gess
fayle
and
the
key
unit
holati
tate
said
that
about
it
we
one
of
a
few
thousand
federation
groups
assigned
to
the
same
general
job
each
group
works
at
its
specialties
and
the
information
gets
correlated
he
paused
the
federation
council
they
the
ones
we
working
for
directly
the
council
biggest
concern
is
the
very
delicate
political
situation
that
involved
they
feel
it
could
develop
suddenly
into
a
dangerous
one
they
may
be
right
in
what
way
trigger
asked
well
suppose
that
key
unit
is
lost
and
stays
lost
suppose
all
the
other
plasmoids
put
together
do
contain
enough
information
to
show
how
the
old
galactics
produced
the
things
and
got
them
to
operate
somebody
would
get
that
worked
out
pretty
soon
would
they
not
necessarily
or
even
probably
according
to
mantelish
and
some
other
people
who
know
what
happened
there
seem
to
be
too
many
basic
factors
missing
it
might
be
necessary
to
develop
a
whole
new
class
of
sciences
first
and
that
could
take
a
few
centuries
well
trigger
admitted
i
could
get
along
without
the
things
indefinitely
same
here
the
plasmoid
nabob
agreed
ungratefully
weird
beasties
but
let
see
at
present
there
are
twelve
hundred
and
member
worlds
to
the
federation
are
there
more
or
less
and
the
number
of
planetary
confederacies
subplanetary
governments
industrial
financial
and
commercial
combines
assorted
power
groups
etc
and
so
on
is
something
i
hate
to
have
to
calculate
what
are
you
driving
at
she
asked
they
all
been
told
we
heading
for
a
new
golden
age
courtesy
of
the
plasmoid
science
practically
everybody
has
believed
it
now
considerable
doubt
oh
she
said
of
course
practically
everybody
is
going
to
get
very
unhappy
eh
that
said
commissioner
tate
is
only
a
little
of
it
yes
the
thing
is
just
lost
somebody
got
it
very
likely
trigger
nodded
fayle
ship
might
have
got
wrecked
accidentally
of
course
but
the
way
he
took
off
shows
he
planned
to
disappear
a
on
top
of
that
would
be
too
much
of
a
coincidence
so
any
one
of
umpteen
thousands
of
organizations
in
the
hub
might
be
the
one
that
has
that
plasmoid
now
including
said
holati
any
one
of
the
two
hundred
and
fourteen
restricted
worlds
their
treaties
of
limitation
would
have
let
them
get
into
the
plasmoid
pie
until
the
others
had
been
at
it
a
decade
or
so
they
would
have
been
quite
eager
there
was
a
little
pause
then
trigger
said
lordy
the
thing
could
even
set
off
another
string
of
wars
that
a
point
the
council
is
nervous
about
he
said
well
it
certainly
is
a
mess
you
would
have
thought
the
federation
might
have
had
a
security
chief
in
on
that
first
operation
right
there
on
harvest
moon
they
did
he
said
it
was
fayle
oh
pretty
embarrassing
trigger
was
silent
a
moment
holati
could
those
things
ever
become
as
valuable
as
people
keep
saying
it
all
sounded
a
little
exaggerated
to
me
the
commissioner
said
he
wondered
about
it
too
i
not
enough
of
a
biologist
to
make
an
educated
guess
what
it
seems
to
boil
down
to
is
that
they
might
which
would
be
enough
to
tempt
a
lot
of
people
to
gamble
very
high
for
a
chance
to
get
control
of
the
plasmoid
process
and
we
know
definitely
that
some
people
are
gambling
for
it
how
do
you
know
we
been
working
a
couple
of
leads
here
pretty
short
leads
so
far
but
you
work
with
what
you
can
get
he
nodded
at
the
table
we
picked
up
the
first
lead
through
trigger
glanced
down
the
plasmoid
lay
there
some
inches
from
the
side
of
her
hand
you
know
she
said
uncomfortably
old
repulsive
moved
again
while
we
were
talking
towards
my
hand
she
drew
the
hand
away
i
was
watching
it
major
quillan
said
reassuringly
from
the
end
of
the
table
i
would
have
warned
you
but
it
stopped
when
it
got
as
far
as
it
is
now
that
was
around
five
minutes
ago
trigger
reached
back
and
gave
old
repulsive
a
cautious
pat
very
lively
character
he
does
feel
pleasant
to
touch
pleasant
how
did
you
get
a
lead
through
him
mantelish
brought
it
back
to
maccadon
with
him
mainly
because
of
its
similarity
to
he
was
curious
because
he
could
even
guess
at
what
its
function
was
it
was
just
lying
there
in
a
cubicle
so
he
did
considerable
experimenting
with
it
while
he
waited
for
gess
fayle
to
show
up
and
league
headquarters
fidgeted
around
hoping
to
get
the
kind
of
report
from
mantelish
and
fayle
that
mantelish
thought
already
received
they
were
wondering
where
fayle
was
too
but
they
knew
fayle
was
security
so
they
did
like
to
get
too
nosy
trigger
shook
her
head
wonderful
so
what
happened
with
mantelish
began
to
get
results
with
it
the
commissioner
said
one
experiment
was
rather
startling
he
been
trying
that
electrical
stimulation
business
nothing
happened
until
he
had
finished
then
he
touched
the
plasmoid
and
it
fed
the
whole
charge
back
to
him
apparently
it
was
a
fairly
hefty
dose
she
laughed
delightedly
good
for
repulsive
stood
up
for
his
rights
eh
mantelish
gained
some
such
impression
anyway
he
became
more
cautious
with
it
after
that
and
then
he
learned
something
that
should
be
important
he
was
visiting
another
lab
where
they
had
a
couple
of
plasmoids
which
actually
moved
now
and
then
he
had
in
his
coat
pocket
the
two
lab
plasmoids
stopped
moving
while
he
was
there
they
have
moved
since
like
the
harvest
moon
plasmoids
when
they
stimulated
right
he
thought
about
that
and
then
located
another
moving
plasmoid
he
dropped
in
to
look
it
over
with
in
his
pocket
again
and
it
stopped
he
did
the
same
thing
in
one
more
place
and
then
quit
there
are
that
many
moving
plasmoids
around
those
three
labs
are
still
wondering
what
hit
their
specimens
she
studied
curiously
a
mighty
mite
what
does
mantelish
make
of
it
he
thinks
the
unit
forms
a
kind
of
system
the
big
one
induces
plasmoid
activity
the
little
one
modifies
it
this
might
be
a
spare
regulator
but
it
seems
to
be
more
than
a
spare
which
brings
us
to
that
first
lead
we
got
a
gang
of
raiders
crashed
mantelish
lab
one
night
when
was
that
some
months
ago
before
you
and
i
left
manon
the
professor
was
out
and
had
gone
along
in
his
pocket
as
usual
but
his
two
lab
guards
and
one
of
the
raiders
were
killed
the
others
got
away
gess
defection
was
a
certainty
by
then
and
everybody
was
very
nervous
the
feds
got
there
fast
and
the
raider
they
learned
just
two
things
one
he
been
and
could
have
spilled
any
significant
information
even
if
they
had
got
him
alive
the
other
item
they
drew
from
his
brain
was
a
clear
impression
of
the
target
of
the
raid
the
professor
pal
here
trigger
said
lost
in
thought
she
poked
repulsive
lightly
that
would
be
fayle
and
his
associates
then
or
somebody
who
knew
about
them
did
they
want
to
kill
it
or
grab
it
the
commissioner
looked
at
her
grab
it
was
the
report
why
just
wondering
would
make
a
difference
would
it
did
they
try
again
there
been
five
more
attempts
he
said
and
what
everybody
concluded
from
that
they
want
in
a
very
bad
way
so
they
need
it
in
connection
with
the
key
unit
trigger
asked
probably
that
makes
everything
look
very
much
better
does
it
quite
a
little
he
said
the
unit
may
not
work
or
may
not
work
satisfactorily
unless
is
in
the
area
mantelish
talks
of
something
he
calls
proximity
influence
whatever
that
is
has
demonstrated
it
has
it
so
trigger
said
they
might
have
two
thirds
of
what
everybody
wants
and
you
might
have
one
third
right
here
on
the
table
how
many
of
the
later
raiders
did
you
catch
all
of
them
said
the
commissioner
around
forty
we
got
them
dead
we
got
them
alive
it
did
make
much
difference
they
were
hired
hands
very
expensive
hired
hands
but
still
just
that
most
of
them
did
know
a
thing
we
could
use
the
ones
that
did
know
something
were
again
i
thought
trigger
said
reflectively
you
could
someone
like
that
you
can
sometimes
if
you
very
good
at
it
and
if
you
have
time
enough
we
could
afford
to
wait
a
year
they
died
before
they
could
tell
us
anything
there
was
a
pause
then
trigger
asked
how
did
you
get
involved
in
this
personally
more
or
less
by
accident
the
commissioner
said
it
was
in
connection
with
our
second
lead
that
me
huh
she
said
unhappily
yes
why
would
anyone
want
to
grab
me
i
do
know
anything
he
shook
his
head
we
have
found
out
yet
we
hoping
we
will
in
a
very
few
days
is
that
one
of
the
things
you
ca
tell
me
about
i
can
tell
you
most
of
what
i
know
at
the
moment
said
the
commissioner
remember
the
night
we
stopped
off
at
evalee
on
the
way
in
from
manon
yes
she
said
that
big
hotel
about
an
hour
after
you
decided
to
hit
the
bunk
holati
said
i
portaled
back
to
your
rooms
to
pick
up
some
precol
reports
we
been
setting
up
trigger
nodded
i
remember
the
reports
a
couple
of
characters
were
working
on
your
doors
when
i
got
there
they
went
for
their
guns
unfortunately
but
i
called
the
nearest
scout
intelligence
office
and
had
them
why
that
she
asked
it
could
have
been
an
accident
a
couple
of
ordinary
thugs
but
their
equipment
looked
a
little
too
good
for
ordinary
thugs
i
did
know
just
what
to
be
suspicious
of
but
i
got
suspicious
anyway
that
you
all
right
trigger
acknowledged
what
were
they
they
had
an
evalee
record
which
told
us
more
than
the
brains
did
they
were
boys
their
brains
told
us
they
allowed
themselves
to
be
on
this
particular
job
boys
wo
do
that
unless
they
can
set
their
standard
price
very
much
higher
it
look
at
all
any
more
as
if
they
come
to
your
door
by
accident
no
she
admitted
the
feds
got
in
on
it
then
there
been
that
business
in
lab
there
were
similarities
in
the
pattern
you
knew
mantelish
been
on
harvest
moon
with
him
they
thought
there
could
be
a
connection
but
what
connection
she
protested
i
i
do
know
anything
that
could
do
anybody
any
good
he
shrugged
i
ca
figure
it
either
trigger
girl
but
the
upshot
of
it
was
that
i
was
put
in
charge
of
this
phase
of
the
general
investigation
if
there
is
a
connection
it
come
out
eventually
in
any
case
we
want
to
know
who
been
trying
to
have
you
picked
up
and
why
she
studied
his
face
with
troubled
eyes
that
quite
definite
is
it
she
asked
there
could
possibly
still
be
a
mistake
no
it
definite
so
that
what
the
grabber
business
in
the
colonial
school
yesterday
was
about
he
nodded
it
was
their
first
try
since
the
evalee
matter
why
do
you
think
they
waited
so
long
because
they
suspected
you
were
being
guarded
it
difficult
to
keep
an
adequate
number
of
men
around
without
arousing
doubts
in
interested
observers
trigger
glanced
at
the
plasmoid
that
sounds
she
remarked
as
if
you
let
other
interested
observers
feel
you
left
them
a
good
opening
to
get
at
repulsive
he
did
quite
smile
i
might
have
done
that
do
tell
the
council
trigger
pursed
her
lips
i
wo
so
the
grabbers
who
were
after
me
figured
i
was
but
then
they
came
in
anyway
that
seem
very
bright
or
did
you
do
something
again
to
make
them
think
the
road
was
clear
no
he
said
they
were
trying
to
clear
the
road
for
themselves
we
thought
they
would
finally
the
deal
was
set
up
as
a
as
a
what
you
slug
into
what
could
be
a
trap
like
that
with
one
gang
if
it
was
a
trap
they
were
sacrifices
you
hope
the
opposition
will
now
relax
its
precautions
sometimes
it
does
and
a
day
or
so
later
back
for
the
real
raid
that
works
occasionally
anyway
it
was
the
plan
in
this
case
how
do
you
know
they
started
closing
in
for
the
grab
in
ceyce
when
quillan
group
located
you
so
quillan
grabbed
you
first
she
flushed
i
was
as
smart
as
i
thought
was
i
the
commissioner
grunted
smart
enough
to
give
us
a
headache
but
did
have
any
trouble
finding
you
we
discovered
tonight
that
some
kind
of
tracer
material
had
been
worked
into
all
your
clothes
even
the
flimsies
somebody
may
have
been
planted
in
the
school
laundry
but
that
not
important
now
he
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
what
made
you
decide
to
take
off
so
suddenly
he
asked
trigger
shrugged
i
was
getting
pretty
angry
with
you
she
admitted
more
or
less
with
everybody
then
i
applied
for
a
transfer
and
the
application
bounced
from
evalee
i
figured
i
had
enough
and
that
just
quietly
clear
out
so
i
did
or
thought
i
did
ca
blame
you
said
holati
trigger
said
i
still
think
it
would
have
been
smarter
to
keep
me
informed
right
from
the
start
of
what
was
going
on
he
shook
his
head
i
would
be
telling
you
a
thing
even
now
he
said
if
it
had
been
definitely
established
that
you
already
involved
in
the
matter
this
could
develop
into
a
pretty
messy
operation
i
would
have
wanted
you
in
on
it
if
it
could
have
been
avoided
and
if
you
were
going
to
be
in
on
it
i
could
go
spilling
federation
secrets
to
you
i
in
on
it
definitely
eh
he
nodded
for
the
duration
but
you
still
not
telling
me
everything
there
a
few
things
i
ca
tell
you
he
said
i
following
orders
in
that
trigger
smiled
faintly
that
a
switch
i
did
know
you
knew
how
i
followed
plenty
of
orders
in
my
time
the
commissioner
said
when
i
thought
they
made
sense
and
i
think
these
do
trigger
was
silent
a
moment
you
said
a
while
ago
that
most
of
the
heat
was
to
go
off
me
tonight
can
you
talk
about
that
yes
that
all
right
he
considered
i
have
to
tell
you
something
else
again
first
why
we
going
to
manon
she
settled
back
in
her
chair
go
ahead
somebody
got
the
idea
that
one
of
the
things
gess
fayle
might
have
done
is
to
arrange
things
so
he
would
have
to
come
back
to
the
hub
for
a
while
if
he
could
set
up
shop
on
some
outworld
far
enough
away
and
tinker
around
with
that
plasmoid
unit
for
a
year
or
so
until
he
knew
all
about
it
he
might
do
better
for
himself
than
by
simply
selling
it
to
somebody
but
that
would
be
pretty
risky
would
it
said
trigger
with
just
the
equipment
he
could
pack
on
a
league
transport
not
very
much
risk
said
the
commissioner
if
he
had
an
agreement
to
have
an
independent
fleet
meet
him
oh
she
nodded
and
by
what
is
at
all
events
an
interesting
coincidence
the
commissioner
went
on
we
had
word
that
an
outfit
called
fleet
has
been
heard
from
for
some
months
their
area
is
a
long
way
out
beyond
manon
but
fayle
could
have
made
it
there
at
league
ship
speeds
in
about
twenty
days
less
if
vishni
sent
a
few
pilots
to
meet
him
and
guide
him
out
of
subspace
if
he
bought
vishni
had
his
pick
of
a
few
hundred
uncharted
habitable
planets
and
a
few
thousand
very
expert
outworlders
to
see
nothing
happens
to
him
planetside
and
vishni
boys
are
exactly
the
kind
of
crumbs
you
could
buy
for
a
deal
like
that
now
what
been
done
is
to
hire
a
few
of
the
other
around
there
and
set
them
and
as
many
space
scout
squadrons
as
could
be
kicked
loose
from
duty
elsewhere
to
surveying
the
vishni
territory
our
outfit
is
in
charge
of
that
operation
and
manon
of
course
is
a
lot
better
point
from
which
to
conduct
it
than
the
hub
if
something
is
discovered
that
looks
interesting
enough
to
investigate
in
detail
we
only
be
a
week
run
away
so
we
been
ready
to
move
for
the
past
two
weeks
now
which
was
when
the
first
reports
started
coming
in
from
the
vishni
area
negative
reports
so
far
by
the
way
i
kept
stalling
from
day
to
day
because
there
were
also
indications
that
your
grabber
friends
might
be
getting
set
to
swing
at
you
finally
it
seemed
tidier
to
get
that
matter
cleared
up
first
now
they
swung
and
we
go
he
rubbed
his
chin
the
nice
thing
about
it
all
he
remarked
is
that
we
going
there
with
the
two
items
the
opposition
has
revealed
it
wants
we
letting
them
know
those
items
will
be
available
in
the
manon
system
henceforward
they
might
get
discouraged
and
just
drop
the
whole
project
if
they
do
that
fine
we
go
ahead
with
cleaning
up
the
vishni
phase
of
the
operation
but
he
continued
the
indications
are
they
ca
drop
their
project
any
more
than
we
can
drop
looking
for
that
key
unit
so
we
expect
them
to
show
up
in
manon
when
they
do
they
be
working
in
unfamiliar
territory
and
in
a
system
where
they
have
only
something
like
fifty
thousand
people
to
hide
out
in
instead
of
a
planetary
civilization
i
think
they
find
things
getting
very
hot
for
them
very
fast
in
manon
good
said
trigger
that
i
like
but
what
makes
you
think
the
opposition
is
just
one
group
there
might
be
a
bunch
of
them
by
now
maybe
even
fighting
among
themselves
i
bet
on
at
least
two
groups
myself
he
said
and
if
fighting
they
got
our
blessing
they
still
all
opposition
as
far
as
we
concerned
she
nodded
how
are
you
letting
them
know
about
the
move
the
mountains
around
here
are
lousy
with
observers
very
cute
tricks
some
of
them
use
one
boy
has
been
sitting
in
a
hollow
tree
for
weeks
we
let
them
see
what
we
want
to
this
evening
they
saw
you
coming
in
later
tonight
they
see
you
climbing
into
the
ship
with
the
rest
of
the
party
and
taking
off
they
already
picked
up
messages
to
tell
them
just
where
the
ship
going
he
paused
but
you
got
a
job
to
finish
up
here
first
trigger
that
take
about
four
days
so
it
really
be
you
they
see
climbing
into
the
ship
what
she
straightened
up
we
got
a
facsimile
for
you
he
explained
girl
agent
she
goes
along
to
draw
the
heat
to
manon
trigger
felt
herself
tightening
up
slowly
all
over
what
this
job
you
talking
about
she
asked
evenly
ca
tell
you
in
too
much
detail
but
around
four
days
from
now
somebody
is
coming
in
to
maccadon
to
interview
you
interview
me
what
about
he
hesitated
a
moment
there
a
theory
he
said
that
you
might
have
information
you
do
know
you
have
and
that
the
people
who
sent
grabbers
after
you
want
that
information
if
it
true
the
interview
will
bring
it
out
her
mouth
went
dry
suddenly
she
turned
her
head
to
quillan
major
she
said
i
think
i
like
that
cigarette
now
he
came
over
and
lit
one
for
her
trigger
thanked
him
and
puffed
and
she
almost
spilled
everything
she
was
thinking
the
reservation
every
last
thing
i
like
to
get
it
straight
she
said
what
you
talking
about
sounds
like
it
a
job
holati
it
in
that
class
he
said
but
it
wo
be
an
ordinary
the
people
who
are
coming
here
are
top
experts
at
that
kind
of
work
she
nodded
i
do
know
much
about
it
do
they
think
somebody
got
to
me
with
a
or
something
that
i
been
conditioned
something
like
that
i
do
know
trigger
he
said
it
may
be
something
in
that
line
but
whatever
it
is
they
be
able
to
handle
it
trigger
moistened
her
lips
i
was
thinking
you
know
she
said
supposing
i
he
shook
his
head
i
can
tell
you
that
anyway
he
said
we
already
know
you
not
trigger
was
silent
a
moment
then
she
said
after
that
over
i
to
ship
out
to
manon
is
that
it
that
right
but
it
would
depend
on
the
outcome
of
that
interview
too
would
it
trigger
pointed
out
i
mean
you
ca
really
be
sure
what
those
people
might
decide
can
you
yes
i
can
he
said
this
thing
been
all
scheduled
out
trigger
and
the
next
step
of
the
schedule
for
you
is
manon
nothing
else
she
did
believe
him
in
the
least
he
could
know
she
nodded
guess
i
might
as
well
play
along
she
looked
at
him
i
do
think
i
really
had
much
choice
did
i
afraid
not
he
admitted
it
one
of
those
things
that
just
have
to
be
done
but
you
wo
find
it
all
bad
your
companion
by
the
way
for
the
next
three
days
will
be
mihul
mihul
trigger
exclaimed
right
there
said
mihul
voice
trigger
swung
around
in
her
chair
mihul
stood
in
a
door
which
had
appeared
in
the
full
wall
of
the
room
she
gave
trigger
a
smile
trigger
looked
back
at
the
commissioner
i
do
get
it
she
said
oh
mihul
in
scout
intelligence
he
said
would
be
here
if
she
were
been
an
agent
for
eighteen
years
mihul
said
coming
forward
hi
trigger
surprised
yes
trigger
admitted
very
they
brought
me
into
this
job
mihul
said
because
they
figured
you
and
i
would
get
along
together
just
fine
it
was
really
infernally
bad
luck
mihul
was
going
to
be
the
least
easy
of
wardens
to
get
away
from
particularly
in
time
to
catch
a
liner
tomorrow
night
mihul
knew
her
much
too
well
like
to
come
along
and
meet
your
facsimile
now
mihul
inquired
she
grinned
most
people
find
the
first
time
quite
an
experience
trigger
stood
up
resignedly
all
right
she
said
they
were
being
polite
about
it
but
it
was
clear
that
it
was
still
a
cop
and
prisoner
situation
and
old
friend
mihul
she
remembered
something
then
i
believe
major
quillan
has
my
gun
he
looked
at
her
thoughtfully
not
smiling
no
he
said
gave
it
to
mihul
that
right
said
mihul
let
go
kid
they
went
out
through
the
door
that
had
appeared
in
the
wall
it
closed
again
behind
them
the
facsimile
stood
up
from
behind
a
table
at
which
she
had
been
sitting
as
trigger
and
mihul
came
into
the
room
she
gave
trigger
a
brief
impersonal
glance
then
looked
at
mihul
mihul
performed
no
introductions
dress
robe
and
scarf
she
said
to
the
facsimile
the
shoes
are
close
enough
she
turned
to
trigger
she
be
wearing
your
street
clothes
when
she
leaves
she
said
could
we
have
the
dress
now
trigger
pulled
the
dress
over
her
head
tossed
it
to
mihul
and
stood
in
her
underwear
looking
at
her
double
slip
out
of
her
street
clothes
they
did
seem
to
be
a
very
close
match
in
size
and
proportions
watching
the
shifting
play
of
slim
muscles
in
the
long
legs
and
smooth
back
trigger
decided
the
similarity
was
largely
a
natural
one
the
hair
was
the
same
of
course
the
gray
eyes
seemed
almost
identical
and
the
rest
of
the
face
was
a
little
identical
they
must
have
used
a
there
it
was
a
bit
uncanny
like
seeing
one
mirror
image
start
moving
about
independently
if
the
girl
had
talked
it
might
have
reduced
the
effect
but
she
remained
silent
she
put
on
the
dress
trigger
had
been
wearing
and
smoothed
it
down
mihul
surveyed
the
result
she
nodded
perfect
she
took
robe
and
scarf
from
the
back
of
a
chair
where
someone
had
draped
them
and
handed
them
over
you
wo
wear
the
scarf
she
said
just
shove
it
into
a
pocket
of
the
coat
the
girl
slung
the
cloak
over
her
shoulder
and
stood
holding
the
scarf
mihul
looked
her
over
once
more
you
do
she
said
she
smiled
briefly
all
right
the
facsimile
glanced
at
trigger
again
turned
and
moved
attractively
out
of
the
room
trigger
frowned
something
wrong
mihul
asked
she
had
gone
over
to
a
wall
basin
and
was
washing
out
a
tumbler
why
does
she
walk
like
that
the
little
swing
in
the
rear
she
studied
it
mihul
half
filled
the
tumbler
with
water
fished
a
transparent
splinter
of
something
out
of
a
pocket
and
cracked
the
splinter
over
the
edge
of
the
glass
among
your
friends
it
referred
to
as
the
argee
lilt
she
got
you
down
pat
kid
trigger
did
comment
am
i
supposed
to
put
on
her
clothes
no
we
got
another
costume
for
you
mihul
came
over
holding
out
the
glass
this
is
for
you
trigger
looked
at
the
glass
suspiciously
what
in
it
the
blue
eyes
regarded
her
mildly
you
could
call
it
a
sedative
do
need
any
thanks
better
take
it
anyway
mihul
patted
her
hip
with
her
other
hand
little
hypo
gun
here
that
the
alternative
what
that
right
same
type
of
charge
as
in
your
fancy
denton
stuff
in
the
glass
is
easier
to
take
and
wo
leave
you
groggy
what
the
idea
i
known
you
quite
a
while
said
mihul
and
i
was
watching
you
the
last
twenty
minutes
in
that
room
through
a
screen
you
take
off
again
if
you
get
the
least
chance
i
do
blame
you
a
bit
you
being
pushed
around
but
now
it
my
job
to
see
you
do
take
off
and
until
we
get
to
where
you
going
i
want
to
be
sure
you
stay
quiet
she
still
held
out
the
glass
in
a
long
tanned
capable
hand
she
stood
three
inches
taller
than
trigger
weighted
pounds
more
not
an
ounce
of
that
additional
pounds
was
fat
if
she
needed
assistance
the
hunting
lodge
was
full
of
potential
helpers
she
did
i
never
claimed
i
liked
this
arrangement
trigger
said
carefully
i
did
say
i
go
along
with
it
i
will
is
that
enough
sure
mihul
said
promptly
give
word
of
parole
there
was
a
long
pause
no
trigger
said
i
thought
not
drink
or
gun
drink
trigger
said
coldly
she
took
the
glass
how
long
will
it
put
me
out
eight
to
nine
hours
mihul
stood
by
watchfully
while
trigger
emptied
the
tumbler
after
a
moment
the
tumbler
fell
to
the
floor
she
reached
out
and
caught
trigger
as
she
started
down
all
right
she
said
across
her
shoulder
to
the
open
doorway
behind
her
let
move
trigger
awoke
and
instantly
went
taut
with
tension
she
lay
quiet
a
few
seconds
not
even
opening
her
eyes
there
was
cool
sunlight
on
her
eyelids
but
she
was
indoors
there
was
a
subdued
murmur
of
sound
somewhere
after
a
moment
she
knew
it
came
from
a
news
viewer
turned
low
in
some
adjoining
room
but
there
did
seem
to
be
anybody
immediately
around
her
warily
she
opened
her
eyes
she
was
on
a
couch
in
an
airy
spacious
room
furnished
in
the
palest
of
greens
and
ivory
one
entire
side
of
the
room
was
either
a
window
or
a
solido
screen
in
it
was
a
distant
mountain
range
with
many
snowy
peaks
an
almost
cloudless
blue
sky
sun
at
midmorning
or
midafternoon
sun
and
all
had
the
look
of
maccadon
they
probably
still
were
on
the
planet
that
was
where
the
interview
was
to
take
place
but
she
also
could
have
been
sent
on
a
space
cruise
which
would
be
a
rather
good
way
to
make
sure
a
prisoner
stayed
exactly
where
you
wanted
her
this
could
be
a
spaceliner
suite
with
a
packaged
view
of
any
one
of
some
hundreds
of
worlds
and
with
packaged
sunlight
thrown
in
there
was
one
door
to
the
room
it
stood
open
and
the
news
viewer
talk
came
from
there
trigger
sat
up
quietly
and
looked
down
at
the
clothes
she
wore
all
white
a
of
some
soft
rather
heavy
very
comfortable
unfamiliar
stuff
bare
midriff
white
kid
trousers
which
flared
at
the
thighs
and
were
drawn
in
to
a
close
fit
just
above
the
knees
and
down
the
calves
vanishing
into
kid
boots
with
thick
flexible
soles
sporting
outfit
that
meant
maccadon
she
pulled
a
handful
of
hair
forward
and
looked
at
it
they
recolored
it
this
time
to
a
warm
mahogany
brown
she
swung
her
legs
off
the
couch
and
stood
up
quietly
a
dozen
soft
steps
across
the
springy
turf
of
ivory
carpet
took
her
to
the
window
the
news
viewer
clicked
and
went
silent
not
bad
trigger
said
she
saw
a
long
range
of
woodlands
and
open
heath
rising
gradually
into
the
flanks
of
the
mountains
on
the
far
right
was
the
still
silver
glitter
of
two
lakes
where
are
we
byla
uplands
game
preserve
that
the
game
bird
area
before
you
mihul
appeared
in
the
doorframe
in
an
outfit
almost
a
duplicate
of
trigger
in
tones
feel
all
right
feeling
fine
trigger
said
byla
uplands
the
southern
tip
of
the
continent
she
could
make
it
back
to
ceyce
in
two
hours
or
less
she
turned
and
grinned
at
mihul
i
also
feel
hungry
how
long
was
i
out
mihul
glanced
at
her
wrist
watch
eight
hours
ten
minutes
you
woke
up
on
schedule
i
had
breakfast
sent
up
thirty
minutes
ago
i
already
eaten
mine
took
one
sniff
and
plunged
in
it
good
mihul
hair
trigger
saw
had
been
cropped
short
and
a
streak
of
gray
added
over
the
right
side
and
they
changed
the
color
of
her
eyes
to
hazel
she
wondered
what
had
been
done
to
her
along
that
line
want
to
come
in
mihul
said
we
can
talk
while
you
eat
trigger
nodded
after
i
freshened
up
the
bathroom
mirror
showed
they
left
her
eyes
alone
but
there
was
a
very
puzzling
impression
that
she
was
staring
at
an
image
considerably
plumper
shorter
younger
than
it
should
be
a
around
seventeen
or
eighteen
her
eyes
narrowed
if
they
done
on
her
it
could
cause
complications
she
stripped
hurriedly
and
checked
they
had
tampered
with
her
body
so
it
had
to
be
the
clothes
though
it
was
difficult
to
see
how
even
the
most
cunning
cut
could
provide
such
a
very
convincing
illusion
of
being
more
rounded
out
heavier
around
the
thighs
larger
breasts
just
missing
being
dumpy
in
fact
she
dressed
again
looked
again
and
came
out
of
the
bathroom
still
puzzled
choice
of
three
game
birds
for
breakfast
mihul
announced
never
heard
of
any
of
them
all
good
plus
regular
stuff
she
patted
her
flat
midriff
ate
too
much
she
admitted
now
dig
in
and
i
brief
you
trigger
dug
in
i
had
a
look
at
myself
in
the
mirror
she
remarked
what
this
business
of
fifteen
or
so
pounds
of
baby
fat
mihul
laughed
you
do
really
have
it
i
know
that
too
how
do
they
do
it
subcolor
job
in
the
clothes
they
not
really
white
anyone
looking
at
you
gets
his
vision
distorted
a
little
without
realizing
it
takes
a
wider
view
of
certain
areas
for
example
you
can
play
it
around
in
a
lot
of
ways
i
never
heard
of
that
one
trigger
said
you
think
it
would
be
sensational
in
fashions
it
would
be
right
now
it
top
secret
for
as
long
as
intelligence
can
keep
it
that
way
trigger
chewed
a
savory
morsel
of
something
then
why
did
you
tell
me
you
one
of
the
gang
however
reluctant
and
you
good
at
keeping
the
mouth
shut
your
name
by
the
way
is
now
comteen
lod
just
turned
eighteen
i
am
your
dear
mama
you
call
me
drura
we
from
on
evalee
here
for
a
few
days
shooting
trigger
nodded
do
we
do
any
shooting
mihul
pointed
a
finger
at
a
side
table
the
denton
lay
there
looking
like
a
toy
beside
a
standard
sporting
pistol
bet
your
life
comteen
she
said
i
always
been
too
stingy
to
try
out
a
preserve
on
my
own
money
and
this
one
is
class
she
paused
comteen
and
drura
lod
really
exist
we
a
very
fair
copy
of
what
they
look
like
and
they
be
kept
out
of
sight
till
we
done
here
now
she
leaned
back
comfortably
tilting
the
chair
and
clasping
her
hands
around
one
knee
aside
from
the
sport
we
here
because
you
a
convalescent
you
recovering
from
a
rather
severe
attack
of
dykart
fever
heard
of
it
trigger
reflected
something
you
pick
up
in
some
sections
of
the
evalee
tropics
is
it
mihul
nodded
that
what
you
did
child
skipped
your
shots
on
the
last
trip
we
took
and
six
months
later
you
still
paying
for
it
you
were
in
one
of
those
typical
dykart
fever
comas
when
we
brought
you
in
last
night
very
clever
trigger
commented
acidly
very
mihul
pursed
her
lips
the
dykart
bug
causes
temporary
derangements
you
know
spells
during
which
convalescents
talk
wildly
imagine
things
trigger
popped
another
fragment
of
meat
between
her
teeth
and
chewed
thoughtfully
looking
over
at
mihul
very
good
duck
or
whatever
she
said
like
imagining
they
been
more
or
less
kidnapped
you
mean
things
like
that
mihul
agreed
trigger
shook
her
head
i
would
anyway
you
types
are
bound
to
have
all
the
legal
angles
covered
sure
said
mihul
just
thought
i
mention
it
have
you
used
the
denton
much
on
game
not
too
often
trigger
had
been
wondering
whether
they
left
the
stunner
compartment
loaded
but
it
a
very
fair
gun
for
it
i
know
the
other
one
a
yool
good
game
gun
too
you
use
that
trigger
swallowed
she
met
the
calm
eyes
watching
her
i
never
handled
a
yool
why
the
switch
they
easy
to
handle
the
reason
for
the
switch
is
that
you
just
stun
someone
with
a
yool
it
better
if
we
both
stay
armed
though
it
is
really
necessary
so
much
money
comes
to
play
around
here
they
can
afford
to
keep
the
uplands
very
thoroughly
policed
and
they
do
but
an
ace
in
the
hole
never
hurts
she
considered
changed
your
mind
about
that
parole
business
yet
i
had
really
thought
about
it
trigger
said
i
let
you
carry
your
own
gun
then
trigger
looked
reflective
then
shook
her
head
i
rather
not
suit
yourself
mihul
said
agreeably
in
that
case
though
there
should
be
something
else
understood
what
that
we
have
up
to
days
to
spend
here
together
before
whatzzit
shows
up
whatzzit
for
future
reference
mihul
said
whatzzit
will
be
that
which
or
he
or
she
who
wishes
to
have
that
interview
with
you
and
has
arranged
for
it
that
in
case
you
want
to
talk
about
it
i
might
as
well
tell
you
that
i
do
very
little
talking
about
whatzzit
i
thought
trigger
suggested
i
was
one
of
the
gang
i
got
special
instructions
on
the
matter
mihul
said
anyway
whatzzit
shows
up
you
have
your
interview
after
that
we
do
whatever
whatzzit
says
we
to
do
as
you
know
trigger
nodded
meanwhile
said
mihul
we
here
very
pleasant
place
to
spend
days
in
my
opinion
and
i
think
in
yours
very
pleasant
trigger
agreed
i
been
suspecting
it
was
you
who
suggested
it
would
be
a
good
place
to
wait
in
no
mihul
said
though
i
might
have
if
anyone
had
asked
me
but
whatzzit
handling
all
the
arrangements
it
seems
now
we
could
have
fun
here
which
i
suspect
would
be
the
purpose
as
far
as
concerned
fun
trigger
said
to
put
you
into
a
good
frame
of
mind
for
that
interview
might
be
the
idea
mihul
said
i
do
know
three
days
here
should
relax
almost
anyone
get
in
a
little
shooting
loaf
around
the
pools
go
for
rides
things
like
that
the
only
trouble
is
i
afraid
you
nourishing
dark
notions
which
are
likely
to
take
all
the
enjoyment
out
of
it
not
to
mention
the
possibility
of
really
relaxing
like
what
trigger
asked
oh
mihul
said
there
all
sorts
of
possibilities
of
course
she
nodded
her
head
at
the
guns
like
yanking
the
denton
out
of
my
holster
and
feeding
me
a
dose
of
the
stunner
or
picking
up
that
coffee
pot
there
and
tapping
me
on
the
skull
with
it
it
about
the
right
weight
trigger
said
thoughtfully
i
do
think
either
of
those
would
work
they
might
mihul
said
they
just
might
you
fast
you
been
taught
to
improvise
and
there
something
eating
you
you
edgy
as
a
cat
so
trigger
said
so
mihul
said
there
are
a
number
of
alternatives
i
lay
them
out
for
you
you
take
your
pick
for
one
i
could
just
keep
you
doped
three
days
in
dope
wo
hurt
you
and
you
certainly
be
no
problem
then
another
way
i
let
you
stay
awake
but
we
stay
in
our
rooms
i
can
lock
you
in
at
night
and
that
window
is
i
checked
it
would
be
sort
of
boring
but
we
can
have
tapes
and
stuff
brought
up
have
the
guns
put
away
and
i
watch
you
like
a
hawk
every
minute
of
the
day
she
looked
at
trigger
inquiringly
like
either
of
those
not
much
trigger
said
they
safe
mihul
said
quite
safe
maybe
i
should
well
the
heat
off
and
it
just
a
matter
now
of
holding
you
for
whatzzit
there
a
couple
of
other
choices
one
of
them
has
an
angle
you
like
much
either
on
the
other
hand
it
would
give
you
a
sporting
chance
to
take
off
if
you
really
wild
about
it
and
it
entirely
in
line
with
my
instructions
i
warned
them
you
tricky
trigger
stopped
eating
let
hear
that
one
mihul
tilted
the
chair
back
a
little
farther
and
studied
her
a
moment
pretty
much
like
i
said
before
everything
friendly
and
casual
gun
a
bit
swim
a
bit
go
for
a
ride
or
soar
lie
around
in
the
sun
but
because
of
those
notions
of
yours
there
be
one
thing
added
an
an
trigger
repeated
exactly
said
mihul
is
at
all
in
line
with
my
instructions
but
you
a
pretty
dignified
little
character
and
i
think
it
should
work
just
what
does
this
consist
of
trigger
inquired
warily
if
you
make
a
break
and
get
away
mihul
said
that
one
thing
something
eating
you
and
i
not
sure
i
like
the
way
this
been
handled
in
fact
i
do
like
it
so
i
try
to
stop
you
from
leaving
but
if
it
turns
out
i
could
i
wo
hold
any
grudges
even
if
i
wake
up
with
lumps
she
paused
on
the
other
hand
she
said
there
we
are
together
for
days
i
do
want
to
spend
them
fighting
off
attempts
to
clobber
me
every
thirty
seconds
so
any
time
you
try
and
miss
comteen
mama
is
going
to
pin
you
down
fast
and
hot
up
your
seat
with
whatever
is
handiest
trigger
stared
at
her
she
cleared
her
throat
while
i
carrying
a
gun
she
said
shakily
do
be
ridiculous
mihul
you
not
going
to
gun
me
for
keeps
to
get
out
of
a
licking
mihul
said
and
that
all
the
yool
can
do
how
else
will
you
stop
me
trigger
fingernails
drummed
the
table
top
briefly
she
wet
her
lips
i
do
know
she
admitted
of
course
said
mihul
all
this
unpleasantness
can
be
avoided
very
easily
there
always
the
fourth
method
what
that
just
give
parole
no
parole
trigger
said
thinly
all
right
which
of
the
other
ways
will
it
be
trigger
did
hesitate
the
sporting
chance
she
said
the
others
are
choices
fair
enough
said
mihul
she
stood
up
and
went
over
to
the
wall
she
selected
a
holster
belt
from
the
pair
hanging
there
and
fastened
it
around
her
i
rather
thought
you
pick
it
she
said
she
gave
trigger
a
brief
grin
just
make
sure
it
a
good
opening
i
will
trigger
said
mihul
moved
to
the
side
table
took
up
the
denton
looked
at
it
and
slid
it
into
her
holster
she
turned
to
gaze
out
the
window
nice
country
she
said
if
you
done
with
breakfast
how
about
going
out
right
now
for
a
first
try
at
the
birds
trigger
hefted
the
coffee
pot
gently
it
was
about
the
right
weight
at
that
but
the
range
was
a
little
more
than
she
liked
considering
the
besides
it
might
crack
the
monster
skull
she
set
the
pot
gently
down
again
great
idea
she
said
and
i
all
finished
eating
half
an
hour
later
there
still
had
been
any
decent
openings
trigger
was
maintaining
a
somewhat
brooding
silence
at
the
moment
mihul
beside
her
in
the
driver
seat
of
the
tiny
sports
hopper
chatted
pleasantly
about
this
and
that
but
she
did
appear
to
expect
any
answers
there
were
many
left
to
be
wasted
trigger
stared
thoughtfully
out
through
the
telescopic
plate
before
her
while
the
hopper
soared
at
a
thousand
feet
toward
the
square
of
preserve
area
which
had
been
assigned
to
them
to
hunt
over
that
morning
dimly
reflected
in
the
view
plate
she
could
see
the
head
of
the
who
went
with
that
particular
area
lifted
above
the
behind
her
he
was
gazing
straight
ahead
between
the
two
humans
absorbed
in
canine
reflections
there
was
plenty
of
bird
life
down
there
some
were
original
terran
forms
maintained
unchanged
in
the
genetic
banks
probably
many
more
were
inspired
modifications
produced
on
grand
commerce
game
ranches
at
any
other
time
trigger
would
have
found
herself
enjoying
the
outing
almost
as
much
as
mihul
not
now
other
things
kept
running
through
her
head
money
for
example
they
had
returned
her
own
cash
to
her
and
apparently
did
intend
to
at
least
not
until
after
the
interview
but
mihul
was
carrying
at
least
part
of
their
spending
money
in
a
hip
pocket
wallet
the
rest
of
it
might
be
in
a
concealed
room
safe
or
deposited
with
the
resort
hotel
cashier
she
glanced
over
at
mihul
again
good
friend
mihul
never
before
had
looked
quite
so
large
lithe
alert
and
generally
fit
for
a
that
idea
was
fiendishly
ingenious
it
was
difficult
to
plan
things
through
clearly
and
calmly
while
kept
quailing
at
vivid
visualizations
of
the
results
of
making
a
mistake
the
hopper
settled
down
near
the
center
of
their
territory
guided
the
last
half
mile
by
mihul
who
had
fancied
the
looks
of
some
ravines
ahead
trigger
opened
the
door
on
her
side
the
leaped
lightly
across
the
seat
and
came
out
behind
her
he
turned
to
look
over
his
huntresses
and
gave
them
a
wag
a
polite
but
perfunctory
one
then
he
stood
waiting
for
orders
mihul
considered
him
guess
he
in
charge
here
she
said
she
waved
a
hand
at
the
pup
go
find
old
boy
we
string
along
he
loped
off
swiftly
a
lean
brown
houndlike
creature
a
grand
commerce
development
of
some
aristocratic
terran
breed
and
probably
a
considerable
improvement
on
the
best
of
his
progenitors
he
curved
around
a
thick
clump
of
shrubs
like
a
hawk
two
plump
and
crimson
whirred
up
out
of
the
near
side
of
the
shrubbery
saw
the
humans
before
them
and
rose
steeply
picking
up
speed
a
great
many
separate
clearly
detailed
things
seemed
to
be
going
on
within
the
next
four
or
five
seconds
mihul
swore
scooping
the
denton
out
of
its
holster
trigger
already
had
the
yool
out
but
the
gun
was
unfamiliar
she
hesitated
fascinated
she
glanced
from
the
speeding
soaring
to
mihul
watched
the
tall
woman
straighten
for
an
overhead
shot
left
hand
grasping
right
wrist
to
steady
the
lightweight
denton
and
in
that
particular
instant
trigger
knew
exactly
what
was
going
to
happen
next
the
denton
flicked
forth
one
bolt
mihul
stretched
a
little
more
for
the
next
shot
trigger
wheeled
dropping
the
yool
left
elbow
close
in
to
her
side
her
left
fist
rammed
solidly
into
bare
brown
midriff
just
under
the
arch
of
the
rib
cage
that
punch
in
those
precise
circumstances
would
have
paralyzed
the
average
person
it
did
quite
paralyze
mihul
she
dropped
forward
doubled
up
and
struggling
for
breath
but
already
twisting
around
toward
trigger
trigger
stepped
across
her
picked
up
the
denton
shifted
its
setting
thumbed
it
to
stunner
max
and
let
mihul
have
it
between
the
shoulder
blades
mihul
jerked
forward
and
went
limp
trigger
stood
there
shaking
violently
looking
down
at
mihul
and
fighting
the
irrational
conviction
that
she
had
just
committed
murder
the
trotted
up
with
the
one
downed
bird
he
placed
it
reverently
by
mihul
outflung
hand
then
he
sat
back
on
his
haunches
and
regarded
trigger
with
something
of
the
detached
compassion
of
a
good
undertaker
apparently
this
was
his
first
experience
with
a
hunting
casualty
the
story
trigger
babbled
into
the
hopper
communicator
a
minute
later
was
that
drura
lod
had
succumbed
to
an
attack
of
dykart
fever
coma
and
that
an
ambulance
and
a
fast
flit
to
a
hospital
in
the
nearest
city
were
indicated
the
preserve
hotel
was
startled
but
reassuring
that
the
mother
should
be
afflicted
with
the
same
ailment
as
the
daughter
was
news
to
them
but
plausible
enough
within
eight
minutes
a
police
ambulance
was
flying
mihul
and
trigger
at
emergency
speeds
towards
a
small
uplands
city
behind
the
mountains
trigger
never
found
out
the
city
name
three
minutes
after
followed
mihul
floating
stretcher
into
the
hospital
she
quietly
left
the
building
again
by
a
street
entrance
mihul
wallet
had
contained
two
hundred
and
thirteen
crowns
it
was
enough
barely
she
got
a
complete
change
of
clothes
in
the
first
automatic
service
store
she
came
to
and
left
the
store
in
them
carrying
the
sporting
outfit
in
a
bag
the
aircab
she
hired
to
take
her
to
ceyce
had
to
be
paid
for
in
advance
which
left
her
crowns
as
they
went
flying
over
a
lake
a
while
later
the
bag
with
the
sporting
clothes
and
accessories
was
dumped
out
of
the
cab
rear
window
it
was
just
possible
that
the
space
scouts
had
been
able
to
put
that
tracer
material
idea
to
immediate
use
in
ceyce
a
short
two
hours
after
she
felled
mihul
trigger
called
the
interstellar
spaceport
and
learned
that
the
dawn
city
was
open
to
passengers
and
their
guests
birna
drellgannoth
picked
up
her
tickets
and
went
on
board
mingling
unostentatiously
with
a
group
in
a
mood
of
festive
she
went
fading
even
more
unostentatiously
down
a
hallway
when
the
group
stopped
cheerfully
to
pose
for
a
solidopic
girl
from
one
of
the
news
agencies
she
located
her
cabin
after
a
lengthy
search
set
the
door
to
glanced
around
the
cabin
and
decided
to
inspect
it
in
more
detail
later
she
pulled
off
her
slippers
climbed
on
the
outsized
divan
which
passed
here
for
a
bunk
and
stretched
out
she
lay
there
a
while
blinking
at
the
ceiling
and
worrying
a
little
about
mihul
even
theoretically
a
blast
could
cause
mihul
the
slightest
permanent
damage
it
might
however
leave
her
in
a
fairly
peevish
mood
after
the
grogginess
wore
off
since
the
impact
was
supposed
to
be
pleasant
but
mihul
had
stated
she
would
hold
no
grudges
over
a
successful
escape
attempt
and
even
if
they
caught
up
with
her
again
before
she
got
to
manon
this
attempt
certainly
had
to
be
rated
a
technical
success
they
might
catch
up
of
course
trigger
thought
the
federation
must
have
an
enormous
variety
of
means
at
its
disposal
when
it
set
out
seriously
to
locate
one
of
its
missing
citizens
but
the
dawn
city
would
be
some
hours
on
its
way
before
mihul
even
began
to
think
coherently
again
she
spread
the
alarm
then
but
it
should
be
a
while
before
they
started
to
suspect
trigger
had
left
the
planet
maccadon
was
her
home
world
after
all
if
she
just
wanted
to
hole
up
that

where
she
would
have
had
the
best
chance
to
do
it
successfully

the
first
hub

was
only
nine
hours
flight
away
garth

less
than
five
hours
beyond

after
that
there
was
only
the
long
subspace
run
to

they
have
to
work
very
fast
to
keep
her
from
leaving
the
hub
this
time
trigger
glanced
over
at
the
denton
lying
by
the
bedside
comweb
on
a
little
table
at
the
head
of
the
she
was
aware
of
a
feeling
of
great
contentment
of
growing
relaxation
she
closed
her
eyes
by
and
large
she
thought
all
things
considered
she
had
come
off
badly
among
the
cloak
and
dagger
experts
she
was
on
her
way
to
manon
some
hours
later
she
slept
through
the
dawn
city
thunderous
takeoff
when
she
woke
up
next
she
was
in
semidarkness
but
she
knew
where
she
was
and
a
familiar
feeling
of
told
her
the
ship
was
in
flight
she
sat
up
at
her
motion
the
area
about
her
brightened
and
the
cabin
grew
visible
again
it
was
rather
large
there
were
three
closed
doors
in
the
walls
and
the
walls
themselves
were
light
amber
of
oddly
insubstantial
appearance
a
rosy
tinge
was
flowing
up
from
the
floor
level
through
them
and
as
the
color
surged
higher
and
deepened
there
came
an
accompanying
stir
of
barely
audible
music
the
sign
still
reflected
dimly
from
the
interior
panels
of
the
passage
door
trigger
found
its
control
switch
on
the
bedstand
and
shut
it
off
at
once
a
soft
chiming
sounded
from
the
miniature
comweb
on
the
bedstand
its
screen
filled
with
a
pulsing
glow
and
there
was
a
voice
this
is
a
recording
miss
drellgannoth
the
voice
told
her
if
room
service
may
intrude
with
an
audio
message
please
be
so
good
as
to
touch
the
blue
circle
at
the
base
of
your
comweb
trigger
touched
the
blue
circle
go
ahead
she
invited
thank
you
miss
drellgannoth
said
the
voice
for
the
duration
of
the
voyage
your
personal
comweb
will
be
opened
to
callers
for
either
audio
or
visual
intrusion
only
by
your
verbal
permission
or
by
your
touch
on
the
blue
circle
it
stopped
another
voice
picked
up
this
is
your
personal
room
stewardess
miss
drellgannoth
forgive
the
intrusion
but
the
ship
will
dive
in
one
hour
do
you
wish
to
have
a
rest
cubicle
prepared
no
thanks
trigger
said
i
stay
awake
thank
you
miss
drellgannoth
as
a
formality
and
in
accordance
with
federation
regulations
allow
me
to
remind
you
that
federation
law
does
not
permit
the
bearing
of
personal
weapons
by
passengers
during
a
dive
her
glance
went
to
the
denton
all
right
she
said
i
wo
because
of
dive
hallucinations
i
suppose
thank
you
very
much
miss
drellgannoth
yes
it
is
because
of
the
misapprehensions
which
may
be
caused
by
dive
hallucinations
may
i
be
of
service
to
you
at
this
time
perhaps
you
would
like
me
to
demonstrate
the
various
interesting
uses
of
your
personal
comweb
cabinet
trigger
eyes
shifted
to
the
far
end
of
the
cabin
a
rather
large
very
elegant
piece
of
furniture
stood
there
its
function
had
been
immediately
obvious
but
she
had
heard
of
comweb
service
cabinets
she
thanked
the
stewardess
but
declined
the
offer
the
lady
switched
off
apparently
a
trifle
distressed
at
not
having
discovered
anything
birna
drellgannoth
personal
stewardess
might
do
for
birna
right
now
trigger
went
curiously
over
to
the
cabinet
it
opened
at
her
touch
and
she
sat
down
before
it
glancing
over
its
panels
a
remarkable
number
of
uses
were
indicated
which
might
make
it
confusing
to
the
average
hub
citizen
but
she
had
been
trained
in
communications
and
the
service
cabinet
was
as
simple
as
any
gadget
in
its
class
could
get
she
punched
in
the
ship
location
diagram
the
dawn
city
was
slightly
more
than
an
hour
out
of
ceyce
port
but
it
had
yet
cleared
the
subspace
nets
which
created
interlocking
and
impenetrable
fields
of
energy
about
the
maccadon
system
a
ship
could
dive
in
such
an
area
without
risking
immediate
destruction
but
the
nets
were
painstakingly
maintained
insurance
against
a
day
when
subspace
warfare
might
again
explode
through
the
hub
trigger
glanced
over
the
diagrammed
route
ahead
evalee
garth
a
tiny
green
spark
in
the
far
remoteness
of
space
beyond
them
represented
manon
sun
eleven
days
or
so
with
the
money
to
afford
a
rest
cubicle
the
time
could
be
cut
to
a
subjective
three
or
four
hours
but
it
would
have
been
foolish
anyway
to
sleep
through
the
one
trip
on
a
hub
luxury
liner
she
was
ever
likely
to
take
in
her
life
she
set
the
cabinet
to
a
review
of
the
dawn
city
passenger
facilities
and
was
informed
that
everything
would
remain
at
the
disposal
of
waking
passengers
throughout
all
dives
she
glanced
over
bars
fashion
shows
dining
and
gaming
rooms
the
cascade
plunge
from
the
looks
of
it
would
have
been
something
for
mihul
our
large
staff
of
companions
just
what
she
needed
the
solido
auditorium
and
the
inferno
our
sensations
unlimited
hall
a
dulcet
voice
informed
her
regretfully
that
federation
law
did
not
permit
the
transmission
of
full
su
effects
to
individual
cabins
it
did
however
permit
a
few
sample
glimpses
trigger
took
her
glimpses
sniffed
austerely
switched
back
to
the
fashions
there
had
been
a
neat
little
black
suit
on
display
there
while
she
did
intend
to
start
roaming
about
the
ship
until
it
dived
and
the
majority
of
her
fellow
travelers
were
immersed
in
their
rest
cubicles
she
probably
still
would
be
somewhat
conspicuous
in
her
automatic
sales
dress
on
a
boat
like
the
dawn
city
that
little
black
suit
had
looked
at
all
expensive
twelve
hundred
federation
credits
she
repeated
evenly
a
minute
later
i
see
came
to
roughly
eight
hundred
fifty
maccadon
crowns
was
what
she
saw
may
we
model
it
in
your
suite
madam
the
store
manager
inquired
no
thanks
trigger
told
her
just
looking
them
over
a
bit
she
switched
off
frowned
absently
at
a
panel
labeled
your
selection
of
personalized
illusion
arrangements
shook
her
head
snapped
the
cabinet
shut
and
stood
up
it
looked
like
she
had
a
choice
between
being
conspicuous
and
staying
in
her
cabin
and
playing
around
with
things
like
the
creation
of
illusion
scenes
and
she
was
really
a
little
old
for
that
kind
of
entertainment
she
opened
the
door
to
the
narrow
passageway
outside
the
cabin
and
glanced
tentatively
along
it
it
was
very
quiet
here
one
of
the
reasons
this
was
the
cheapest
cabin
they
had
available
presumably
was
that
it
lay
outside
the
main
passenger
areas
to
the
right
the
corridor
opened
on
a
larger
hall
which
ran
past
a
few
hundred
yards
of
storerooms
before
it
came
to
a
stairway
at
the
head
of
the
stairway
one
came
out
eventually
on
one
of
the
passenger
levels
to
the
left
the
corridor
ended
at
the
door
of
what
seemed
to
be
the
only
other
cabin
in
this
section
trigger
looked
back
toward
the
other
cabin
oh
she
said
well
hello
the
other
cabin
door
stood
open
a
rather
little
person
sat
in
a
low
armchair
immediately
inside
it
she
had
lifted
a
thin
arm
in
a
greeting
or
beckoning
gesture
as
trigger
turned
she
repeated
the
gesture
now
come
here
girl
she
called
amiably
in
a
quavery
voice
well
it
could
do
any
harm
trigger
put
on
her
polite
smile
and
walked
down
the
hall
toward
the
open
door
a
quite
tiny
old
woman
it
was
with
a
head
either
shaved
or
naturally
bald
dressed
in
a
kind
of
pajamas
long
glassy
earrings
of
the
same
color
pulled
down
the
lobes
of
her
small
ears
the
oddness
of
the
face
was
due
mainly
to
the
fact
that
she
wore
a
great
deal
of
and
that
the
was
a
matching
green
she
twisted
her
head
to
the
left
as
trigger
came
up
and
chirped
something
another
woman
appeared
behind
the
door
almost
a
duplicate
of
the
first
except
that
this
one
had
gone
all
out
for
pink
tiny
things
they
both
beamed
up
at
her
trigger
beamed
back
she
stopped
just
outside
the
door
greetings
said
the
pink
one
greetings
trigger
replied
wondering
what
world
they
came
from
the
style
was
exactly
like
anything
she
seen
before
we
the
green
lady
informed
her
with
a
not
unkindly
touch
of
condescension
are
with
the
askab
of
elfkund
oh
said
trigger
in
the
tone
of
one
who
is
impressed
elfkund
rung
any
bells
and
with
whom
are
you
girl
the
pink
one
inquired
well
trigger
said
i
not
actually
anybody
the
smiles
faded
abruptly
they
glanced
at
each
other
then
looked
back
at
trigger
rather
severely
it
seemed
did
you
mean
the
green
one
asked
carefully
that
you
are
a
retainer
trigger
nodded
i
from
maccadon
she
explained
the
name
is
birna
drellgannoth
maccadon
the
pink
one
repeated
you
are
a
commoner
then
young
birna
of
course
she
is
the
green
one
looked
offended
maccadon
she
got
out
of
her
chair
with
remarkable
spryness
and
moved
to
the
door
quite
drafty
she
said
looking
pointedly
past
trigger
the
door
closed
on
trigger
face
a
second
later
she
heard
the
lock
snap
shut
a
moment
after
that
the
sign
appeared
well
she
thought
wandering
back
to
her
cabin
it
did
look
as
if
she
were
going
to
be
bothered
with
excessively
friendly
neighbors
on
this
trip
she
had
a
bath
and
then
discovered
a
mechanical
stylist
in
a
recess
beside
the
bathroom
mirror
she
swung
the
gadget
out
into
the
room
set
it
for
a
dye
removal
operation
and
sat
down
beneath
it
a
redhead
again
a
minute
or
so
later
she
switched
the
machine
to
orado
styles
and
left
it
to
make
up
its
electronic
mind
as
to
what
would
be
the
most
suitable
creation
under
the
circumstances
the
stylist
hovered
above
her
for
over
a
minute
muttering
and
clucking
as
it
conducted
an
apparently
disapproving
survey
of
the
job
then
it
went
swiftly
and
silently
to
work
when
it
shut
itself
off
trigger
checked
the
results
in
the
mirror
she
was
too
pleased
an
upswept
arrangement
which
brought
out
the
bone
structure
of
her
face
rather
well
but
did
do
much
else
for
her
possibly
the
stylist
had
included
the
automatic
sales
dress
in
its
computations
well
it
would
have
to
do
for
her
first
tour
of
the
ship
the
bedside
comweb
warned
her
politely
that
it
was
now
ten
minutes
to
dive
point
waking
passengers
who
experienced
subspace
distress
in
any
form
could
obtain
immediate
assistance
by
a
call
on
any
comweb
if
they
preferred
they
could
have
their
cabins
kept
under
the
continuous
visual
supervision
of
their
personal
steward
or
stewardess
the
dawn
city
passenger
areas
still
looked
rather
well
populated
when
trigger
arrived
but
some
of
the
passengers
were
showing
signs
of
regretting
their
decision
to
stay
awake
presently
she
became
aware
of
a
faint
queasiness
herself
it
was
bad
mainly
a
sensation
as
if
the
ship
were
trying
continuously
to
turn
over
on
its
axis
around
her
and
not
quite
making
it
and
she
knew
from
previous
experience
that
after
the
first
hour
or
so
she
would
be
completely
free
of
that
she
walked
into
a
low
dimly
lit
very
gambling
room
still
well
patronized
by
the
hardier
section
of
her
fellow
travelers
searching
for
a
place
where
she
could
sit
down
unobtrusively
for
a
while
and
let
the
subspace
reaction
work
itself
out
a
couch
beside
a
closed
door
near
the
unlit
end
of
the
room
seemed
about
right
for
the
purpose
trigger
sat
down
and
glanced
around
there
were
a
variety
of
games
in
progress
all
unfamiliar
to
her
the
players
were
mostly
men
but
a
remarkable
number
of
beautiful
women
beautifully
gowned
stood
around
the
tables
as
observers
traveler
companions
trigger
realized
suddenly
the
dawn
city
employees
naturally
would
be
inured
to
subspace
effects
from
the
scraps
of
talk
she
could
pick
up
the
stakes
seemed
uniformly
high
a
swirl
of
vertigo
suddenly
built
up
in
her
again
this
one
was
stronger
than
most
for
a
moment
she
could
be
sure
whether
she
was
going
to
be
sick
or
not
she
stood
up
stepped
over
to
the
door
a
few
feet
away
pulled
it
open
and
went
through
drawing
it
shut
behind
her
there
had
been
a
shielding
screen
in
the
doorway
on
the
other
side
was
bottled
sunshine
she
found
herself
on
a
long
balcony
which
overlooked
a
formal
garden
enclosure
thirty
feet
below
there
was
no
one
else
in
sight
she
leaned
back
against
the
wall
beside
the
door
closed
her
eyes
and
breathed
slowly
and
deeply
for
some
seconds
the
sickish
sensation
began
to
fade
when
she
opened
her
eyes
again
she
saw
the
little
yellow
man
he
stood
motionless
at
the
far
end
of
the
garden
next
to
some
flowering
shrubbery
out
of
which
he
might
have
just
stepped
he
seemed
to
be
peering
along
the
sand
path
which
curved
in
toward
the
balcony
and
vanished
beneath
it
below
the
point
where
trigger
stood
it
was
sheer
fright
which
immobilized
her
at
first
because
there
was
not
anything
really
human
about
that
small
squat
manshaped
figure
a
dwarfish
yellow
demon
he
seemed
evil
and
menacing
the
garden
she
realized
suddenly
might
be
an
illusion
scene
or
else
the
thing
moved
in
that
instant
it
became
a
blur
of
motion
along
the
curving
path
and
disappeared
under
the
balcony
after
a
second
or
so
she
heard
the
sound
of
a
door
closing
some
distance
away
the
garden
lay
still
again
trigger
stayed
where
she
was
her
knees
shaking
a
little
the
fright
appeared
to
have
driven
every
trace
of
nausea
out
of
her
and
gradually
her
heartbeat
began
to
return
to
normal
she
took
three
cautious
steps
forward
to
the
balcony
railing
where
the
tip
of
a
swaying
green
tree
branch
was
in
reach
she
put
her
hand
out
hesitantly
felt
the
smooth
vegetable
texture
of
a
leaf
grasped
it
pulled
it
away
she
moved
back
to
the
door
and
examined
the
leaf
it
was
a
quite
real
leaf
thin
sap
formed
a
bead
of
amber
moisture
at
the
break
in
the
stalk
as
she
looked
at
it
no
illusion
structure
could
be
elaborated
to
that
extent
so
she
just
had
her
first
dive
hallucination
and
it
had
been
a
dilly
trigger
dropped
the
leaf
pushed
shakily
at
the
balcony
door
and
stepped
back
through
the
screen
into
the
reassuring
murmur
of
human
voices
in
the
gambling
room
an
hour
later
the
ship
loudspeaker
system
went
on
it
announced
that
the
dawn
city
would
surface
in
fifteen
minutes
because
of
gravitic
disturbances
and
proceed
the
rest
of
the
way
to
evalee
in
normal
space
arriving
approximately
five
hours
behind
schedule
rest
cubicle
passengers
would
not
be
disturbed
unless
this
was
specifically
requested
by
a
qualified
associate
trigger
turned
her
attention
back
to
her
viewer
feeling
rather
relieved
she
had
experienced
any
further
hallucinations
or
other
indications
of
subspace
distress
but
the
one
she
had
would
do
her
for
a
while
the
little
viewer
library
she
was
in
was
otherwise
deserted
and
she
been
going
about
her
studies
there
just
the
least
bit
nervously
subject
of
the
studies
were
the
hub
principal
games
of
chance
identified
a
few
of
those
she
been
watching
and
one
of
them
did
look
as
if
someone
who
went
at
it
with
an
intelligent
understanding
of
the
odds
a
part
of
trigger
kept
and
shaking
its
head
at
such
reckless
notions
but
another
part
pointed
out
that
they
could
be
much
worse
off
financially
than
they
were
right
now
so
what
if
they
arrived
in
manon
instead
of
practically
besides
there
was
the
problem
of
remaining
inconspicuous
till
they
got
there
on
the
dawn
city
no
one
whose
wardrobe
was
limited
to
one
automatic
sales
dress
was
going
to
remain
inconspicuous
very
long
went
on
calculating
the
odds
for
various
possible
play
combinations
she
developed
her
first
betting
system
presently
discovered
several
holes
in
it
and
began
to
develop
another
the
loudspeaker
system
went
on
again
she
was
too
absorbed
to
pay
much
attention
to
it
at
first
then
she
suddenly
straightened
up
and
listened
frowning
the
man
speaking
now
was
the
liner
first
security
officer
he
was
being
very
polite
and
regretful
under
section
such
and
such
number
so
and
so
of
the
federation
legal
code
a
cabin
by
cabin
search
of
the
passenger
area
of
the
dawn
city
had
become
necessary
the
persons
of
passengers
would
not
be
searched
passengers
might
if
they
wished
be
present
while
their
cabins
were
inspected
but
this
was
not
required
baggage
need
not
be
opened
providing
its
spyproofing
was
not
activated
any
information
revealed
by
the
search
which
did
not
pertain
to
a
violation
of
the
code
section
and
number
in
question
would
not
be
recorded
and
could
not
be
introduced
as
future
legal
evidence
under
any
circumstances
complaints
regarding
the
search
could
be
addressed
to
any
planetary
moderator
office
this
was
good
at
all
trigger
stood
up
the
absence
of
luggage
in
her
cabin
might
arouse
more
than
passing
interest
in
the
searchers
her
gun
was
a
different
matter
discreet
inquiries
regarding
a
female
passenger
who
carried
a
sporting
denton
might
be
one
of
the
check
methods
used
by
the
scout
intelligence
boys
if
they
started
thinking
of
liners
which
recently
had
left
maccadon
in
connection
with
trigger
disappearance
there
were
likely
to
be
more
than
two
or
three
guns
of
that
type
on
board
and
it
was
almost
certain
that
she
would
be
the
only
woman
who
owned
one
she
better
go
get
the
denton
immediately
and
then
vanish
again
into
the
public
sections
of
the
ship
some
security
officer
with
a
good
memory
and
a
habit
of
noticing
faces
might
identify
her
otherwise
from
the
news
viewer
pictures
taken
on
manon
and
he
just
might
start
wondering
then
why
she
was
traveling
as
birna
drellgannoth
and
start
to
check
she
paused
long
enough
to
get
the
legal
code
article
referred
to
into
the
viewer
somebody
on
board
appeared
to
have
got
himself
murdered
she
reached
the
cabin
too
late
a
couple
of
young
security
men
already
were
going
over
it
trigger
said
hello
pleasantly
it
was
too
bad
but
it
was
their
fault
they
just
had
a
job
to
do
they
smiled
back
at
her
apologized
for
the
intrusion
and
went
on
with
their
business
she
sat
down
and
watched
them
the
denton
was
there
in
plain
sight
dropping
it
into
her
purse
now
would
be
more
likely
to
fix
it
in
their
memory
than
leaving
it
where
it
was
the
gadgets
they
were
using
were
in
concealing
casings
and
she
guess
what
they
were
looking
for
by
the
way
they
used
them
it
seem
that
either
of
them
was
trying
to
haul
up
an
identifying
memory
about
her
they
did
look
a
little
surprised
when
the
second
cabin
closet
was
opened
and
found
to
be
as
empty
as
the
first
but
no
comments
were
made
about
that
two
minutes
after
trigger
had
come
in
they
were
finished
and
bowed
themselves
out
of
the
cabin
again
they
turned
then
toward
the
cabin
occupied
by
the
ancient
retainers
of
the
askab
of
elfkund
trigger
left
her
door
open
this
she
wanted
to
hear
if
she
could
she
heard
the
elfkund
door
also
stayed
open
while
the
racket
beyond
it
grew
shriller
by
the
moment
finally
a
comweb
chimed
a
feminine
voice
spoke
sternly
the
quavering
outcries
subsided
it
looked
as
if
security
had
been
obliged
to
call
on
someone
higher
up
in
the
elfkund
entourage
to
come
to
its
aid
trigger
closed
her
door
grinning
on
the
screen
of
her
secluded
library
she
presently
watched
a
great
port
shuttle
swing
in
from
evalee
to
meet
the
hovering
dawn
city
it
would
bring
another
five
hundred
or
so
passengers
on
board
and
take
off
the
few
who
had
merely
been
making
the
short
run
from
maccadon
to
evalee
in
style
solidopic
operators
were
quite
likely
to
be
on
the
shuttle
so
she
had
decided
to
keep
away
from
the
entry
area
the
transfer
operation
was
carried
out
very
expeditiously
probably
to
make
up
for
some
of
the
time
lost
on
the
surface
when
the
shuttle
shoved
off
the
loudspeaker
announced
that
normal
space
flight
would
be
maintained
till
after
the
stopover
at
garth
trigger
wandered
thoughtfully
back
to
her
cabin
she
closed
the
door
behind
her
then
she
saw
the
man
sitting
by
the
comweb
cabinet
her
breath
sucked
in
she
crouched
a
little
ready
to
wheel
and
bolt
take
it
easy
trigger
major
quillan
said
he
was
in
civilian
clothes
of
rather
dudish
cut
trigger
swallowed
there
was
too
obviously
no
place
to
bolt
to
how
did
you
find
me
he
shrugged
longish
story
you
not
under
arrest
i
not
no
said
quillan
when
we
get
to
manon
the
commissioner
will
have
a
suggestion
to
make
to
you
suggestion
trigger
said
warily
i
believe
you
to
take
back
your
old
precol
job
in
manon
but
as
cover
for
your
participation
in
our
little
project
if
you
agree
to
it
what
if
i
do
he
shrugged
again
it
seems
you
be
writing
your
own
ticket
from
here
on
out
trigger
stared
at
him
wondering
why
quillan
grinned
new
instructions
have
been
handed
down
he
said
if
you
still
curious
ask
whatzzit
oh
trigger
said
then
why
are
you
here
i
said
quillan
am
to
make
damn
sure
you
get
to
manon
i
brought
a
few
people
with
me
mihul
too
trigger
asked
a
shade
diffidently
no
she
on
maccadon
is
she
how
she
doing
doing
all
right
quillan
said
she
sends
her
regards
and
says
a
little
less
heft
on
the
next
solar
plexus
you
torpedo
should
be
good
enough
trigger
flushed
she
is
sore
is
she
not
the
way
you
mean
he
considered
not
many
people
have
jumped
mihul
successfully
in
her
cockeyed
way
she
seemed
pretty
proud
of
her
student
trigger
felt
the
flush
deepen
i
got
her
off
her
guard
she
said
obviously
said
quillan
in
any
ordinary
argument
she
could
pull
your
legs
off
and
tie
you
up
with
them
still
that
was
bad
have
you
talked
to
anybody
since
you
came
on
board
just
the
room
stewardess
and
a
couple
of
old
ladies
in
the
next
cabin
yeah
he
said
couple
of
old
ladies
what
did
you
talk
about
trigger
recounted
the
conversation
he
reflected
nodded
and
stood
up
i
put
a
couple
of
suitcases
in
that
closet
over
there
he
said
your
personal
stuff
is
in
them
another
thing
somebody
checked
over
your
finances
and
came
to
the
conclusion
you
broke
not
exactly
broke
said
trigger
quillan
reached
into
a
pocket
pulled
out
an
envelope
and
laid
it
on
the
cabinet
here
a
little
extra
spending
money
then
he
said
the
balance
of
your
precol
pay
to
date
i
had
it
picked
up
on
evalee
this
morning
seven
hundred
fc
thanks
trigger
said
i
can
use
some
of
that
they
stood
looking
at
each
other
any
questions
he
asked
sure
trigger
said
but
you
would
answer
them
try
me
doll
said
quillan
but
let
shift
operations
to
the
fanciest
cocktail
lounge
on
this
thing
before
you
start
i
feel
like
relaxing
a
little
for
just
one
girl
you
given
us
a
fairly
rough
time
these
last
hours
i
sorry
trigger
said
i
bet
said
quillan
trigger
glanced
at
the
closet
if
he
brought
everything
along
there
was
a
dress
in
one
of
those
suitcases
that
would
have
been
a
little
too
daring
for
maccadon
it
should
therefore
be
just
about
right
for
a
cocktail
lounge
on
the
dawn
city
and
she
had
had
a
chance
to
wear
it
yet
give
me
ten
minutes
to
change
fine
quillan
started
toward
the
door
by
the
way
i
your
neighbor
now
the
cabin
at
the
end
of
the
hall
she
asked
startled
that
right
he
smiled
at
her
i
be
back
in
ten
minutes
well
that
was
going
to
be
cosy
trigger
found
the
dress
shook
it
out
and
slipped
into
it
enormously
puzzled
but
also
enormously
relieved
that
whatzzit
freshening
up
her
she
wondered
how
he
had
induced
the
elfkund
ladies
to
leave
perhaps
he
managed
to
have
a
better
cabin
offered
to
them
it
must
be
convenient
to
have
that
kind
of
a
pull
well
we
did
just
leave
it
up
to
them
quillan
said
engineering
spotted
a
radiation
leak
in
their
cabin
slight
but
definite
they
got
bundled
out
in
a
squawking
hurry
he
added
they
did
get
a
better
cabin
though
might
have
been
less
trouble
to
get
me
to
move
trigger
remarked
might
have
been
i
did
know
what
mood
you
be
in
trigger
decided
to
let
that
ride
this
cocktail
lounge
was
a
very
curious
place
by
the
looks
of
it
there
were
thirty
or
forty
people
in
their
immediate
vicinity
but
if
one
looked
again
in
a
couple
of
minutes
there
might
be
an
entirely
different
thirty
or
forty
people
around
sitting
in
easy
chairs
or
at
tables
standing
about
in
small
groups
talking
drinking
laughing
they
drifted
past
slowly
overhead
below
sometimes
tilted
at
odd
angles
fading
from
sight
and
presently
returning
in
actual
fact
she
and
quillan
were
in
a
little
room
by
themselves
and
with
more
than
ordinary
privacy
via
an
audio
block
and
a
reconstruct
scrambler
which
quillan
had
switched
on
at
their
entry
i
leave
us
out
of
the
viewer
circuit
he
remarked
until
you
finished
your
questions
viewer
circuit
she
repeated
quillan
waved
a
hand
around
that
he
said
there
are
more
commercial
and
industrial
spies
political
agents
confidence
men
and
whatnot
on
board
this
ship
than
you
probably
believe
a
good
percentage
of
them
are
pretty
fair
lip
readers
and
the
things
you
want
to
talk
about
are
connected
with
the
federation
hottest
current
secret
so
while
it
a
downright
crime
not
to
put
you
on
immediate
display
in
a
place
like
this
we
wo
take
the
chance
trigger
let
that
ride
too
a
group
had
materialized
at
an
oblong
table
eight
feet
away
while
quillan
was
speaking
everybody
at
the
table
seemed
fairly
high
and
two
of
the
couples
were
embarrassingly
amorous
but
she
could
quite
picture
any
of
them
as
somebody
spies
or
agents
she
listened
to
the
muted
chatter
some
hub
dialect
she
know
none
of
those
people
can
see
or
hear
us
then
she
asked
not
until
we
want
them
to
viewer
gives
you
as
much
privacy
as
you
like
most
of
the
crowd
here
just
does
see
much
point
to
privacy
like
those
two
trigger
followed
his
glance
at
a
tilted
angle
above
them
a
matched
pair
of
young
sirens
sat
at
a
small
table
sipping
their
drinks
looking
languidly
around
twins
trigger
said
no
said
quillan
that
blent
and
company
oh
blent
a
lady
of
leisure
and
somewhat
excessively
narcissistic
tendencies
he
explained
he
gave
the
matched
pair
another
brief
study
perhaps
one
ca
really
blame
her
one
of
them
her
facsimile
blent
whichever
it
is
is
never
without
her
face
oh
trigger
said
she
been
studying
the
gowns
that
she
said
a
trifle
enviously
is
why
i
not
at
all
eager
to
go
on
display
here
eh
said
quillan
trigger
turned
to
regard
herself
in
the
wall
mirror
on
the
right
which
she
had
noticed
remained
carefully
unobscured
by
drifting
viewers
and
viewees
a
thoughtful
touch
on
the
lounge
management
part
until
we
walked
in
here
she
explained
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
sharp
little
outfit
i
wearing
hmmm
quillan
said
judiciously
he
made
a
detailed
appraisal
of
the
mirror
image
of
the
slim
green
backless
sheath
which
had
looked
so
and
seductive
in
a
ceyce
display
window
trigger
eyes
narrowed
a
little
the
major
had
appraised
the
dress
in
detail
before
it
about
as
sharp
a
little
outfit
as
you
could
get
for
around
a
hundred
and
fifty
credits
he
remarked
most
of
the
items
the
girls
are
sporting
here
are
personality
conceptions
that
starts
at
around
ten
to
twenty
times
as
high
i
was
talking
about
displaying
the
dress
now
what
were
those
questions
trigger
took
a
small
sip
of
her
drink
considering
she
had
made
up
her
mind
about
major
quillan
but
until
she
could
evaluate
him
more
definitely
it
might
be
best
to
go
by
appearances
the
appearances
so
far
indicated
small
sips
in
his
company
how
did
you
people
find
me
so
quickly
she
asked
next
time
you
want
to
sneak
off
a
civilized
planet
quillan
advised
her
pick
something
like
a
small
freighter
or
hire
a
to
get
you
out
of
the
system
and
flag
down
a
freighter
for
you
plenty
of
tramp
captains
will
make
a
space
stop
to
pick
up
a
paying
passenger
liners
we
can
check
sorry
trigger
said
meekly
i
still
new
at
this
business
and
thank
god
for
that
said
quillan
if
you
have
the
time
and
the
money
it
also
a
good
idea
of
course
to
zig
a
few
times
before
you
zag
towards
where
you
really
heading
actually
i
suppose
the
credit
for
picking
you
up
so
fast
should
go
to
those
collating
computers
oh
yes
major
quillan
looked
broodingly
at
his
drink
for
a
moment
there
they
sit
he
remarked
suddenly
with
their
stupid
plastic
faces
hanging
out
rows
of
them
you
feed
them
something
you
do
understand
they
do
understand
it
either
nobody
can
tell
me
they
can
but
they
kick
it
around
and
giggle
a
bit
and
out
comes
some
ungodly
suggestion
so
they
helped
you
find
me
she
said
cautiously
it
was
clear
that
the
major
had
strong
feelings
about
computers
oh
sure
he
said
it
usually
turns
out
it
was
a
good
idea
to
do
what
those
ccs
say
anything
unusual
that
shows
up
in
the
area
you
working
on
gets
chunked
into
the
things
as
a
matter
of
course
we
were
on
the
liners
dawn
city
reports
back
a
couple
of
murders
city
to
the
head
of
the
list
cry
the
computers
nobody
asks
why
they
just
plow
into
the
ticket
purchase
records
and
right
there
are
the
little
argee
thumbprints
he
looked
at
trigger
my
own
bet
he
said
somewhat
accusingly
was
that
you
were
one
of
those
that
had
just
taken
off
we
did
know
about
that
ticket
reservation
what
i
do
see
trigger
said
changing
the
subject
is
why
two
murders
should
seem
so
very
unusual
there
must
be
quite
a
few
of
them
after
all
true
said
quillan
but
not
murders
that
look
like
catassin
killings
oh
she
said
startled
is
that
what
these
were
that
what
ship
security
thinks
trigger
frowned
but
what
could
be
the
connection
quillan
reached
across
the
table
and
patted
her
hand
you
got
it
he
said
with
approval
exactly
no
connection
some
day
i
going
to
walk
down
those
rows
and
give
them
each
a
blast
where
it
will
do
the
most
good
it
will
be
worth
being
broken
for
trigger
said
i
thought
that
catassin
planet
was
being
guarded
it
is
it
would
be
very
hard
to
sneak
one
out
nowadays
but
breeding
them
in
the
hub
just
a
few
keeps
the
price
up
trigger
grimaced
uncomfortably
she
seen
recordings
of
those
swift
clever
constitutionally
murderous
creatures
in
action
you
say
it
looked
like
catassin
killings
they
have
found
it
no
but
they
think
they
got
rid
of
it
emptied
the
air
from
most
of
the
ship
after
they
surfaced
and
combed
over
the
rest
of
it
with
life
detectors
they
got
a
detector
system
set
up
now
that
would
spot
a
catassin
if
it
moved
twenty
feet
in
any
direction
life
detectors
go
haywire
out
of
normal
space
do
they
she
said
that
why
they
surfaced
then
quillan
nodded
you
a
doll
they
pretty
certain
it
been
sucked
into
space
or
disposed
of
by
its
owner
but
they
go
on
looking
till
we
dive
beyond
garth
who
got
killed
a
rest
warden
and
a
security
officer
in
the
rest
cubicle
area
it
might
have
been
sent
after
somebody
there
apparently
it
ran
into
the
two
men
and
killed
them
on
the
spot
the
officer
got
off
one
shot
and
that
set
off
the
automatic
alarms
so
pussy
cat
could
finish
the
job
that
time
it
all
sort
of
gruesome
is
it
trigger
said
catassins
are
quillan
agreed
that
a
fact
trigger
took
another
sip
she
set
down
her
glass
there
something
else
she
said
reluctantly
yes
when
you
said
you
come
on
board
to
see
i
got
to
manon
i
was
thinking
none
of
the
people
who
been
after
me
on
maccadon
could
know
i
was
on
the
dawn
city
they
might
though
quite
easily
oh
said
quillan
yes
you
see
i
made
two
calls
to
the
ticket
office
one
from
a
street
comweb
and
one
from
the
bank
if
they
already
had
spotted
me
by
that
tracer
material
they
could
have
had
an
audio
on
me
i
suppose
i
think
we
better
suppose
it
said
quillan
you
had
a
tail
when
you
came
out
of
the
bank
anyway
his
glance
went
past
her
we
get
back
to
that
later
right
now
take
a
look
at
that
entrance
will
you
trigger
turned
in
the

doubtfully
they
the
ones
lyad
is
the
current
head
of
the
clan
the
history
of

than
one

so
involved

rapidly
that
its
detailed

engaged
in
only
by
specialists

one
tranest

one
of
the
restricted
planets
now
it
she
ventured
it
is
restriction

supposed
to
be
a
handicap
but
tranest
is
also
one
of
the
wealthiest
individual

in
the

watched
the
woman
with
some
interest
as
the
party
moved
along
a
dim
corridor
followed
by
the
viewer
circuit
invisible
lyad
ermetyne
did
look
more
than
a
few
years
older
than
she
was
herself
rather
small
slender
with
delicately
pretty
features
she
wore
something
and
in
lusterless
gray
with
an
odd
smoky
quality
to
it
is
she
the
empress
of
tranest
or
something
of
the
sort
trigger
asked
quillan
shook
his
head
they
had
no
emperors
there
technically
since
they
had
to
sign
their
treaty
with
the
federation
she
just
owns
the
planet
that
all
what
would
she
be
doing
going
to
manon
i
like
to
know
quillan
said
the
ermetyne
a
lady
of
many
interests
now
see
the
plump
elderly
man
just
behind
her
the
ugly
one
with
the
big
head
who
sort
of
keeps
blinking
that
one
he
belchik
pluly
and
pluly
trigger
interrupted
the
pluly
lines
yes
why
oh
nothing
really
i
heard
a
friend
of
mine
pluly
got
a
yacht
out
in
the
manon
system
and
a
daughter
quillan
nodded
nelauk
how
did
you
know
i
met
her
quite
a
girl
that
nelauk
only
child
of
pluly
old
age
and
he
dotes
on
her
anyway
he
been
on
the
verge
of
being
by
grand
commerce
off
and
on
through
the
past
three
decades
but
nobody
ever
been
able
to
pin
anything
more
culpable
on
him
than
that
he
keeps
skimming
extremely
close
to
the
limits
of
a
large
number
of
laws
he
very
rich
i
imagine
trigger
said
thoughtfully
very
he
be
much
richer
even
if
it
were
for
his
hobby
what
that
harems
the
pluly
harems
rate
among
the
most
intriguing
and
best
educated
in
the
hub
trigger
looked
at
pluly
again
ugh
she
said
faintly
quillan
laughed
the
pluly
salaries
are
correspondingly
high
dropping
the
group
now
so
there
just
one
more
i
like
you
to
notice
the
tall
girl
with
black
hair
in
orange
trigger
nodded
yes
i
see
her
she
beautiful
so
she
is
she
also
space
scout
intelligence
gaya
comes
from
farnhart
where
they
use
the
single
name
system
a
noted
horsewoman
very
wealthy
socially
established
which
is
why
we
like
to
use
her
in
situations
like
this
trigger
was
silent
a
moment
then
she
said
what
kind
of
situation
is
it
i
mean
what
she
doing
with
lyad
ermetyne
and
the
others
she
probably
attached
herself
to
the
group
as
soon
as
she
discovered
lyad
had
come
on
board
which
quillan
said
is
exactly
what
i
would
have
told
gaya
to
do
if
i
spotted
lyad
first
trigger
was
silent
a
little
longer
this
time
were
you
thinking
this
lyad
could
be
one
of
our
suspects
well
said
quillan
judiciously
let
say
lyad
has
all
the
basic
qualifications
since
she
come
on
board
we
better
consider
her
when
something
going
on
that
looks
more
than
usually
tricky
lyad
is
always
worth
considering
and
there
one
point
that
looks
even
more
interesting
to
me
now
than
it
did
at
first
what
that
those
two
little
old
ladies
i
eased
out
of
their
rightful
cabin
trigger
looked
at
him
what
about
them
this
about
them
the
askab
of
elfkund
is
you
might
way
one
of
the
branch
managers
of
the
ermetyne
interests
in
the
hub
he
is
also
a
heel
in
his
own
right
but
he
not
the
right
size
to
be
one
of
the
people
we
thinking
about
lyad
is
he
might
have
been
doing
a
job
for
her
job
she
asked
she
laughed
not
with
those
odd
little
grannies
we
know
the
odd
little
grannies
they
the
askab
poisoners
and
pretty
slick
at
it
they
were
sizing
you
up
while
you
were
having
that
little
chat
doll
probably
not
for
a
coffin
this
time
you
were
just
getting
the
equivalent
of
a
pretty
thorough
medical
presumably
though
for
some
sinister
ultimate
purpose
how
do
you
know
trigger
asked
very
uncomfortably
one
of
those
little
suitcases
in
their
cabin
was
a
diagnostic
recorder
it
would
have
been
standing
fairly
close
to
the
door
while
you
were
there
if
they
did
take
your
recordings
out
before
i
got
there
they
still
inside
they
being
watched
and
they
know
it
it
seemed
like
a
good
idea
to
keep
the
askab
feeling
fairly
nervous
until
we
found
out
whether
those
sweethearts
of
his
had
been
parked
next
door
to
you
on
purpose
apparently
they
were
trigger
admitted
nice
bunch
of
people
oh
they
not
all
bad
lyad
has
her
points
and
old
belchik
for
example
is
really
a
heel
he
just
had
no
ethics
or
morals
and
revolting
habits
anyway
all
this
brings
up
the
matter
of
what
we
should
do
with
you
now
trigger
set
her
glass
down
on
the
table
refill
quillan
inquired
he
reached
for
the
iced
crystal
pitcher
between
them
no
she
said
i
just
want
to
make
a
statement
state
away
he
refilled
his
own
glass
for
some
reason
said
trigger
i
been
acting
lately
the
last
two
days
in
a
remarkably
stupid
manner
quillan
choked
he
set
his
glass
down
hastily
reached
over
and
patted
her
hand
doll
he
said
touched
it
come
to
you
at
last
she
scowled
at
him
i
do
usually
act
that
way
that
said
quillan
was
what
had
me
so
baffled
according
to
the
commissioner
and
others
you
as
bright
in
the
head
as
a
diamond
usually
and
frankly
i
know
it
trigger
said
dangerously
do
rub
it
in
i
apologize
said
quillan
he
patted
her
other
hand
at
any
rate
trigger
said
drawing
her
hands
back
now
that
realized
it
i
going
to
make
up
for
it
from
here
on
out
cooperate
to
the
hilt
she
nodded
to
the
hilt
whatever
that
is
you
ca
imagine
said
quillan
how
much
that
relieves
me
he
filled
her
glass
giving
her
a
relieved
look
i
had
definite
instructions
of
course
not
to
do
anything
like
grabbing
you
by
the
back
of
the
neck
flinging
you
into
a
rest
cubicle
and
sitting
on
it
guns
drawn
until
we
berthed
in
precol
port
but
i
was
tempted
i
can
tell
you
he
paused
and
thought
you
know
he
began
again
that
really
would
be
the
best
no
trigger
said
indignantly
when
i
said
cooperate
i
meant
actively
mihul
said
i
considered
one
of
the
gang
in
this
project
from
now
on
i
behave
like
one
and
i
also
expect
to
be
treated
like
one
hm
said
quillan
well
there
is
something
you
can
do
all
right
what
that
go
on
display
here
now
what
for
she
asked
as
bait
you
sweet
ninny
if
the
boss
grabber
is
on
this
ship
we
should
draw
a
new
nibble
from
him
he
appraised
the
green
dress
in
the
mirror
again
his
expression
grew
absent
it
might
be
best
trigger
suspected
a
trifle
uneasily
to
keep
major
quillan
thoughts
turned
away
from
things
like
nibbling
all
right
she
said
briskly
let
do
that
but
you
have
to
brief
me
she
had
felt
somewhat
for
the
first
two
or
three
minutes
but
it
helped
when
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
their
own
table
drifting
by
among
the
others
and
realized
that
the
smiling
viewer
image
over
there
looked
completely
at
her
ease
it
helped
too
that
major
quillan
turned
suddenly
into
the
type
of
companion
in
the
short
preceding
briefing
he
had
pointed
out
that
a
bit
of
flirting
was
a
necessary
or
at
least
nearly
necessary
part
of
the
act
trigger
was
going
along
with
the
flirting
he
could
be
right
about
that
she
intended
to
stay
on
the
alert
for
the
etc
they
got
nibbles
very
promptly
but
not
quite
the
right
kind
the
concealed
table
comweb
murmured
a
caller
requests
to
be
connected
with
major
quillan
is
it
permitted
oho
quillan
said
poisonously
i
suspected
we
should
have
stayed
off
circuit
who
the
caller
the
name
given
is
keth
deboll
quillan
laughed
give
the
little
wolf
major
quillan
regards
and
tell
him
it
was
a
good
try
i
look
him
up
tomorrow
he
gave
trigger
gentle
wink
let
pant
he
said
at
a
distance
she
smiled
uncertainly
if
he
had
a
mustache
she
thought
he
be
twirling
it
there
were
two
more
calls
in
the
next
few
minutes
of
similar
nature
quillan
rebuffed
them
cheerfully
it
was
rather
flattering
in
a
way
she
wondered
how
so
many
people
in
the
cocktail
lounge
happened
to
know
quillan
by
name
when
the
comweb
reported
the
fourth
caller
it
sounded
awed
the
name
given
is
the
lady
lyad
ermetyne
it
said
quillan
beamed
lyad
bless
her
heart
a
pleasure
put
her
through
a
screen
shaped
itself
on
the
wall
mirror
to
the
right
lyad
face
appeared
in
it
heslet
quillan
she
smiled
so
you
are
permanently
lost
to
your
friends
after
all
it
was
a
light
liquid
voice
it
suited
her
appearance
perfectly
only
to
the
frivolous
ones
quillan
said
his
thick
black
brows
went
up
his
face
took
on
a
dedicated
look
i
headed
for
manon
on
duty
she
nodded
still
with
the
subspace
engineers
and
with
the
rank
of
major
by
now
quillan
said
congratulations
but
i
already
observed
that
your
fabulous
good
fortune
has
deserted
you
in
the
least
lyad
glance
switched
to
trigger
she
smiled
again
it
was
a
pleasant
easy
smile
that
showed
white
teeth
would
you
shield
your
comweb
quillan
shield
it
quillan
looked
surprised
why
certainly
he
reached
under
the
edge
of
the
table
the
drifting
viewer
images
vanished
go
ahead
lyad
eyes
turned
back
to
trigger
they
were
eyes
like
amber
or
a
light
wine
fringed
with
long
black
lashes
very
steady
very
knowing
eyes
trigger
felt
herself
tensing
forgive
me
the
discourtesy
of
inquiring
directly
the
light
voice
said
but
you
are
trigger
argee
are
you
quillan
hand
slapped
the
table
he
looked
at
trigger
and
laughed
better
give
up
trigger
i
told
you
you
were
much
more
widely
known
than
you
believed
well
brule
trigger
muttered
moodily
to
the
solidopic
propped
upright
against
the
pillow
before
her
you
bug
those
pretty
blue
eyes
out
if
you
knew
who
invited
me
to
dinner
brule
smiled
back
winningly
she
lay
on
her
cabin
bed
chin
on
her
crossed
arms
eyes
a
dozen
inches
from
the
pretty
blue
ones
she
studied
brule
features
soberly
major
heslet
quillan
she
announced
suddenly
in
cold
even
tones
is
a
completely
impossible
character
it
was
no
more
than
the
truth
she
did
mind
so
much
that
quillan
would
tell
her
what
he
thought
of
lyad
ermetyne
standing
on
the
suspect
list
now
there
had
really
been
much
opportunity
for
open
conversation
so
far
but
he
and
that
unpleasant
belchik
pluly
had
engaged
in
some
jovial
and
when
he
and
trigger
went
over
to
join
lyad
party
at
her
request
and
quillan
cried
out
merrily
that
he
and
belchik
had
long
had
one
great
interest
in
common
then
those
two
great
buddies
vanished
together
for
a
full
hour
to
take
in
some
very
special
not
publicly
programmed
sensations
unlimited
in
the
dawn
city
inferno
lyad
had
smiled
after
them
as
they
left
are
men
disgusting
she
said
tolerantly
that
reflected
on
her
did
it
she
was
supposed
to
be
very
good
friends
with
somebody
like
that
of
course
quillan
must
have
some
bit
of
intelligence
business
in
mind
with
pluly
but
there
should
be
other
ways
of
going
about
it
and
later
when
she
been
just
a
little
stiff
with
him
quillan
had
had
the
nerve
to
tell
her
not
to
be
a
prude
doll
trigger
shoved
the
solidopic
under
the
pillow
then
she
rolled
on
her
side
and
blinked
at
the
wall
naturally
major
quillan
personal
habits
were
none
of
her
business
it
was
just
that
in
less
than
an
hour
he
was
to
pick
her
up
and
take
her
to
the
ermetyne
suite
for
that
dinner
she
was
wondering
how
she
should
behave
towards
him
reasonably
pleasant
but
cool
she
decided
but
again
not
too
cool
since
she
obligated
herself
to
help
him
find
out
what
the
tranest
tycooness
was
after
any
obvious
lack
of
friendliness
between
them
might
make
the
job
more
difficult
trigger
sighed
things
were
getting
complicated
again
while
quillan
was
indulging
his
baser
nature
among
the
questionable
attractions
of
the
inferno
she
shot
three
hundred
of
her
precol
credits
on
a
formal
black
gown
on
what
yesterday
she
would
have
considered
a
rather
unbelievable
gown
even
at
an
ermetyne
dinner
she
could
actually
look
dowdy
in
it
and
then
accompanied
by
gaya
who
had
turned
out
to
be
a
very
pleasant
but
not
very
communicative
companion
she
headed
for
a
gambling
room
to
make
back
the
price
of
the
gown
it
had
worked
out
the
game
she
particularly
studied
up
on
turned
out
to
have
a
five
hundred
minimum
play
which
finished
that
scheme
the
system
she
planned
to
use
looked
very
sound
but
she
needed
more
than
one
chance
to
try
it
in
she
and
gaya
sat
down
at
another
table
with
a
different
game
where
you
could
get
in
for
fifty
credits
in
eight
minutes
trigger
lost
a
hundred
and
twenty
and
quit
gaya
won
it
had
been
an
interesting
day
but
with
some
unsatisfactory
aspects
to
it
she
hauled
the
solidopic
out
from
under
the
pillow
again
and
you
she
told
brule
warningly
seem
to
be
playing
around
with
some
very
bad
company
my
friend
just
luck
i
coming
back
to
see
you
do
get
into
serious
trouble
she
showered
and
was
studying
the
black
gown
effect
before
the
mirror
when
the
comweb
chimed
permission
for
audio
intrusion
granted
trigger
said
casually
without
looking
around
she
was
getting
used
to
this
sort
of
thing
thank
you
miss
drellgannoth
said
the
comweb

package
from
the
beldon
shop

been
deposited
in

frowned
laid
the
gown
across
a
chair
and
went
over
to
the
transmitter
receptacle
she
opened
it
a
flat
small
green
package
marked
the
styles
of
beldon
slid
out
a
delicate
scent
came
trailing
along
with
it
a
small
white
envelope
clung
to
the
top
inside
the
envelope
was
a
card
it
read
a
peace
offering
would
you
wear
it
to
dinner
in
token
of
forgiveness
very
humbly
q
trigger
found
herself
smiling
and
wiped
off
the
smile
then
she
let
it
come
back
no
point
in
staying
grim
with
the
character
she
pulled
the
package
tab
and
it
opened
up
there
were
three
smaller
packages
inside
she
opened
the
first
of
these
and
for
a
moment
gazed
doubtfully
at
four
objects
like
green
leaf
buds
each
the
size
of
her
thumb
she
laid
them
down
and
opened
the
second
package
this
one
contained
a
pair
of
very
fancy
high
heels
green
and
pale
gold
out
of
the
third
flowed
something
which
was
at
all
events
extraordinarily
beautiful
material
of
some
kind
velvety
green
shimmeringly
alive
its
touch
was
a
caress
its
perfume
was
like
soft
whispers
lifting
one
end
with
great
care
between
thumb
and
finger
trigger
let
it
unfold
itself
to
the
floor
tilting
her
head
to
the
side
she
studied
the
shimmering
featherweight
cat
cradle
of
ribbons
that
hung
there
wear
it
what
it
she
reflected
found
her
dressing
gown
in
one
of
the
suitcases
slipped
it
on
sat
down
before
the
comweb
with
the
mysterious
ribbon
arrangement
and
dialed
gaya
number
the
intelligence
girl
was
in
her
cabin
and
obviously
had
been
napping
but
she
was
wide
awake
now
shielded
here
she
said
quickly
as
soon
as
her
image
cleared
go
ahead
it
nothing
important
trigger
said
hastily
gaya
relaxed
just
she
held
up
the
ribbons
major
quillan
sent
me
this
gaya
uttered
a
small
squeal
oh
beautiful
a
beldon
that
what
it
says
gaya
smiled
he
must
like
you
oh
said
trigger
she
hesitated
gaya
face
grew
questioning
she
asked
is
something
the
matter
probably
not
said
trigger
she
considered
if
you
laugh
she
warned
i
hate
you
she
indicated
the
ribbons
again
what
is
that
beldon
really
gaya
blinked
you
have
been
around
our
decadent
circles
long
enough
she
said
soberly
then
she
did
laugh
do
hate
me
trigger
anyway
it
very
high
fashion
it
also
her
glance
went
quickly
over
trigger
in
excellent
taste
in
this
case
it
a
beldon
gown
a
gown
some
of
the
beautiful
ribbons
were
wider
than
others
none
of
them
looked
as
wide
as
they
should
have
been
not
for
a
gown
dubiously
trigger
wriggled
and
fitted
herself
into
the
high
fashion
item
even
before
she
went
over
to
the
mirror
in
it
she
knew
it
would
do
not
possibly
styles
on
many
hub
worlds
were
rather
bold
of
course
but
she
was
sure
this
effect
was
what
the
beldon
designers
had
intended
she
stepped
in
front
of
the
mirror
her
eyes
widened
brother
she
breathed
that
beldon
did
go
with
a
woman
like
stripes
went
with
a
tiger
after
one
look
you
could
quite
understand
why
nature
had
arranged
for
it
first
but
just
as
obviously
there
was
nearly
enough
beldon
around
at
the
moment
trigger
checked
the
time
and
began
to
feel
harried
probably
she
wind
up
wearing
the
black
gown
anyway
but
at
least
she
wanted
to
get
this
matter
worked
out
before
she
decided
she
dialed
for
a
drink
took
two
swallows
and
reflected
that
she
might
have
put
the
thing
on
backwards
or
upside
down
five
minutes
later
she
sat
at
the
dresser
tapping
her
fingers
on
its
glassy
surface
gazing
at
the
small
pile
of
green
ribbons
before
her
and
whistling
softly
there
was
a
thoroughly
bared
look
on
her
face
suddenly
she
stood
up
and
went
back
to
the
comweb
ribbons
said
the
lady
who
was
the
beldon
shop
manager
that
would
be
a
delightful
little
creation
delightful
said
trigger
may
i
see
it
on
the
model
immediately
madam
a
few
moments
later
a
model
strolled
into
the
view
screen
displaying
an
exquisite
arrangement
of
burnt
sienna
ribbons
plus
four
largish
designs
trigger
glanced
quickly
back
to
the
table
where
she
had
put
down
the
strange
green
buds
they
had
quietly
opened
out
meanwhile
she
thanked
the
manager
switched
off
the
comweb
got
into
the
beldon
again
and
attached
her
leaf
designs
where
the
model
had
carried
them
they
adhered
softly
molding
themselves
to
her
neatly
completing
the
costume
she
stepped
into
the
high
heels
and
looked
in
the
mirror
again
she
breathed
brother
again
maccadon
would
have
approved
she
sure
she
approved
either
but
one
thing
was
certain
there
was
the
remotest
suggestion
of
dowdiness
about
a
beldon
objectively
impersonally
considered
the
effect
was
terrific
feeling
tawny
and
feline
trigger
slowly
lifted
one
shoulder
and
lowered
it
again
she
turned
and
strolled
toward
the
mirror
across
the
cabin
admiring
the
shifts
of
the
beldon
effect
in
the
flow
of
motion
terrific
with
another
drink
she
could
do
it
she
dialed
another
drink
and
settled
down
with
it
beneath
the
mechanical
stylist
for
a
readjustment
in
the
hairdo
department
this
time
the
stylist
purred
as
it
surveyed
and
hummed
while
it
worked
and
when
the
hairdo
was
done
and
trigger
moved
to
get
up
its
flexible
little
tool
pads
pulled
her
back
gently
into
the
seat
and
tilted
up
her
chin
for
a
moment
she
was
startled
then
she
saw
that
the
stylist
had
produced
a
shining
kit
and
was
opening
it
this
time
she
was
getting
the
works
twenty
minutes
later
quillan
voice
informed
her
via
the
comweb
that
he
could
be
outside
her
cabin
any
time
she
was
ready
trigger
told
him
cheerily
to
come
right
over
picked
up
her
purse
and
swaggered
toward
the
door
smiling
a
cool
feline
smile
prude
eh
she
muttered
she
opened
the
door
cried
quillan
shaken
they
were
out
on
a
terrace
near
the
top
of
an
illusion
mountainside
in
a
beautiful
evening
dinner
had
been
and
delicious
served
by
its
creators
two
slim
girls
who
looked
much
too
young
to
have
acquired
such
skills
they
were
natives
of
tranest
lyad
said
proudly
and
two
of
the
finest
food
technicians
in
the
hub
they
were
at
all
events
the
two
finest
food
technicians
trigger
had
run
into
as
yet
the
brandy
which
followed
the
dinner
seemed
to
represent
no
to
the
connoisseurs
around
trigger
she
went
at
it
cautiously
though
she
had
swallowed
a
couple
of
capsules
just
before
they
walked
into
the
ermetyne
suite
the
capsules
took
effect
in
the
middle
of
the
first
course
and
what
she
woke
up
to
was
a
disconcerting
awareness
of
being
the
center
of
much
careful
attention
the
boys
were
all
giving
the
eye
intensively
even
lyad
butler
or
majordomo
or
whatever
she
called
him
named
virod
ogled
coldly
out
of
the
background
trigger
gave
them
the
eye
back
one
after
the
other
in
turn
and
that
stopped
it
lyad
beautifully
wearing
something
which
would
have
passed
muster
at
the
annual
presidential
dinner
in
ceyce
looked
amused
it
was
till
the
end
of
the
second
course
that
trigger
began
to
feel
at
ease
again
after
that
she
forgot
more
or
less
about
the
beldon
the
talk
remained
light
during
dinner
when
they
switched
off
the
illusion
background
for
a
look
at
the
during
the
garth
stopover
she
took
the
occasion
to
study
her
companions
in
more
detail
there
were
three
men
at
the
table
lyad
and
herself
quillan
sat
opposite
her
belchik
pluly
unseemly
person
in
a
black
silk
robe
which
left
his
plump
arms
bare
from
the
elbows
down
was
on
right
the
third
man
fascinated
her
it
was
as
if
some
strange
cold
creature
had
walked
up
out
of
a
polar
sea
to
come
on
board
their
ship
it
was
so
much
his
appearance
though
the
green
tip
of
a
vethi
sponge
lying
coiled
lightly
about
his
neck
probably
had
something
to
do
with
the
impression
trigger
knew
about
vethi
sponges
and
their
addicts
though
she
had
seen
either
before
it
was
so
serious
an
addiction
except
perhaps
in
the
fact
that
it
was
rarely
given
up
again
the
sponges
soothed
jangled
nerves
stabilized
unstable
emotions
balmordan
did
look
like
a
man
who
needed
one
he
was
big
not
as
tall
as
quillan
but
probably
heavier
with
strong
features
a
boldly
jutting
nose
bleak
pale
eyes
he
was
about
fifty
and
wore
a
richly
ornamented
blue
shirt
and
trousers
the
shirt
hung
loose
perhaps
to
conceal
the
flattened
contours
of
his
odd
companion
body
lyad
had
introduced
him
as
a
devagas
scientist
and
in
a
manner
which
indicated
he
was
a
man
of
considerable
importance
that
meant
he
was
almost
certainly
a
member
of
the
devagas
hierarchy
which
in
itself
would
have
made
him
very
interesting
trigger
had
run
into
some
of
the
missionaries
the
devagas
kept
sending
about
the
hub
and
she
sometimes
speculated
curiously
regarding
the
leaders
of
that
chronically
angry
unpredictable
nation
which
on
its
restricted
worlds
formed
more
than
six
percent
of
the
population
of
the
hub
the
devagas
seemed
to
like
nobody
and
certainly
nobody
liked
them
balmordan
did
fit
her
picture
of
a
devagas
leader
too
badly
his
manner
and
talk
were
easygoing
and
agreeable
but
his
particular
brand
of
ogle
when
she
first
became
aware
of
it
had
been
disquieting
rather
like
a
biologist
planning
the
details
of
an
interesting
vivisection
of
course
he
a
biologist
but
trigger
kept
wondering
why
lyad
had
invited
him
to
dinner
she
was
positive
for
one
thing
that
belchik
pluly
was
at
all
happy
about
balmordan
presence
dinner
was
over
before
the
garth
and
they
switched
themselves
back
to
the
mountainside
and
took
other
chairs
a
tanned
sinuous
young
woman
called
flam
appeared
from
time
to
time
to
renew
brandy
glasses
and
pass
iced
fruits
around
she
gave
trigger
coolly
speculative
looks
now
and
then
then
virod
showed
up
again
with
a
flat
tray
of
what
turned
out
to
be
a
very
special
brand
of
tobacco
trigger
declined
the
men
made
sounds
of
high
appreciation
and
everybody
including
lyad
lit
up
small
pipes
of
a
very
special
brand
of
coral
and
puffed
away
happily
quillan
looked
up
at
virod
hi
big
boy
he
said
pleasantly
how
everything
been
with
you
virod
in
a
scarlet
jacket
and
creased
black
trousers
bowed
his
shaved
bullet
head
very
slightly
everything
been
fine
major
quillan
he
said
thank
you
he
turned
and
went
out
of
the
place
trigger
glanced
after
him
virod
awed
her
a
little
he
was
really
huge
moving
about
among
them
he
had
seemed
like
a
softly
padding
elephant
and
there
was
an
elephant
steady
deftness
in
the
way
he
held
out
the
tiny
tobacco
trays
the
ermetyne
winked
at
quillan
quillan
wrestled
virod
to
a
pindown
once
she
said
to
trigger
a
minute
round
was
it
thereabouts
quillan
said
he
added
trigger
does
know
yet
that
i
was
a
sports
bum
in
my
youth
really
trigger
said
he
nodded
come
from
a
long
line
of
sports
bums
as
a
matter
of
fact
but
i
broke
tradition
went
into
business
for
myself
finally
nowadays
i
old
and
soft
eh
belchy
the
two
great
pals
sitting
side
by
side
dug
elbows
at
each
other
and
trigger
winced
still
in
the
same
line
of
business
on
the
side
lyad
inquired
quillan
looked
steadily
at
her
and
grinned
more
or
less
he
said
we
might
lyad
said
thoughtfully
come
back
to
that
later
as
for
that
match
with
virod
she
went
on
to
trigger
it
was
really
a
terrific
event
virod
was
a
tranest
arena
professional
before
i
took
him
into
my
personal
employ
and
he
very
very
rarely
been
beaten
in
any
such
contest
she
laughed
and
before
such
a
large
group
of
people
too
i
afraid
he
never
quite
forgiven
you
for
that
quillan
i
keep
out
of
his
way
quillan
said
easily
did
you
people
know
lyad
said
that
the
trouble
on
the
way
between
maccadon
and
evalee
was
caused
by
a
catassin
killing
there
was
a
touch
of
mischief
in
the
question
trigger
thought
there
were
assorted
startled
responses
the
ermetyne
went
briefly
over
some
of
the
details
quillan
had
told
essentially
it
was
the
same
story
and
do
you
know
belchik
what
the
creature
was
trying
to
do
it
was
trying
to
get
into
the
rest
cubicle
vaults
just
think
it
might
have
been
sent
after
you
it
was
rather
cruel
pluly
head
jerked
and
he
blinked
rapidly
at
lyad
saying
nothing
he
was
a
badly
scared
little
man
at
that
moment
trigger
felt
a
little
sorry
for
him
but
not
too
sorry
belchy
ogle
had
been
of
the
straightforward
drooling
variety
you
safe
when
you
in
one
of
those
things
belchik
quillan
said
reassuringly
would
you
feel
a
little
safer
there
yourself
lyad
if
you
say
they
not
even
sure
they
killed
the
creature
i
probably
shall
have
a
cubicle
set
up
here
lyad
said
but
not
as
protection
against
a
catassin
it
would
never
get
past
pilli
for
one
thing
she
looked
at
trigger
oh
i
forgot
you
have
met
pilli
virod
she
called
virod
appeared
at
the
far
end
of
the
terrace
yes
first
lady
bring
in
pilli
she
told
him
virod
bowed
pilli
is
in
the
room
first
lady
he
glanced
about
went
over
to
a
massive
easy
chair
a
few
feet
way
and
swung
it
aside
something
like
a
huge
ball
of
golden
fur
behind
it
moved
and
sat
up
it
was
an
animal
of
some
sort
its
head
seemed
turned
toward
the
group
but
whatever
features
it
had
remained
hidden
under
the
fur
then
an
arm
like
the
arm
of
a
bear
reached
out
and
trigger
saw
a
great
furred
hand
that
in
shape
seemed
completely
human
clutch
the
chair
edge
he
was
resting
lyad
said
not
sleeping
pilli
does
sleep
he
a
perfect
guardian
come
here
pilli
meet
trigger
argee
pilli
swung
up
on
his
feet
it
was
an
impressively
effortless
motion
there
was
a
thick
wide
torso
on
short
thick
legs
under
the
golden
fur
the
structure
was
pilli
might
weigh
around
four
hundred
pounds
he
started
silently
forward
and
trigger
felt
a
tingle
of
alarm
but
he
stopped
six
feet
away
she
looked
at
him
do
i
say
something
to
pilli
lyad
looked
pleased
no
he
a
biostructure
a
very
intelligent
one
but
speech
is
included
in
his
pattern
trigger
kept
looking
at
the
nightmare
how
can
he
see
to
guard
you
through
all
that
hair
he
does
see
lyad
said
at
least
not
as
we
do
pilli
part
of
one
of
our
tranest
experiments
the
original
stock
came
from
the
maccadon
life
banks
a
small
earth
monkey
the
present
level
of
the
experiment
is
on
the
fancy
side
it
has
four
hearts
for
example
and
what
amounts
to
a
second
brain
at
the
lower
half
of
its
spine
but
it
does
come
equipped
with
visual
organs
pilli
is
one
of
of
the
type
they
have
compensatory
perception
of
a
kind
that
is
still
quite
mysterious
we
hope
to
breed
them
past
the
speech
barrier
so
they
can
tell
us
what
they
do
instead
of
seeing
all
right
pilli
run
along
she
said
to
balmordan
i
believe
he
does
like
that
vethi
thing
of
yours
very
much
balmordan
nodded
i
had
the
same
impression
perhaps
trigger
thought
that
was
why
pilli
had
been
lurking
so
close
to
them
she
watched
the
biostructure
move
off
down
the
terrace
grotesque
and
huge
she
had
got
its
scent
as
it
went
past
her
a
fresh
rather
pleasant
whiff
like
the
smell
of
ripe
apples
an
almost
amiable
sort
of
nightmare
figure
pilli
was
the
apple
smell
went
with
that
seemed
to
fit
it
but
nightmare
was
there
too
she
found
herself
feeling
rather
sorry
for
pilli
in
a
way
lyad
said
pilli
brings
us
to
that
matter
of
business
i
mentioned
this
afternoon
the
group
eyes
shifted
over
to
her
she
smiled
we
have
good
scientists
on
tranest
she
said
as
pilli
i
think
demonstrates
she
nodded
at
balmordan
there
are
good
scientists
in
the
devagas
union
and
everyone
here
is
aware
that
the
treaties
of
restriction
imposed
on
both
our
governments
have
made
it
impossible
for
our
citizens
to
engage
seriously
in
plasmoid
research
trigger
nodded
briefly
as
the
eyes
paused
on
her
for
a
moment
quillan
had
cautioned
her
not
to
show
surprise
at
anything
the
ermetyne
might
say
or
do
if
trigger
did
know
what
to
say
herself
she
was
merely
to
look
inscrutable
i
scrut
he
explained
the
others
wo
i
take
over
then
and
you
just
follow
my
lead
get
it
balmordan
lyad
said
i
understand
you
are
going
to
manon
to
attend
the
seminars
and
demonstrations
on
the
plasmoid
station
that
is
true
first
lady
said
balmordan
now
i
lyad
told
the
company
shall
be
more
honest
the
information
released
in
those
seminars
is
of
no
value
whatever
he
she
nodded
at
the
devagas
scientist
and
i
are
going
to
manon
with
the
same
goal
in
mind
that
is
to
obtain
plasmoids
for
our
government
laboratories
balmordan
smiled
amiably
trigger
asked
how
do
you
intend
to
obtain
them
by
offering
very
large
sums
of
money
or
equivalent
inducements
to
people
who
are
in
a
position
to
get
them
for
me
said
lyad
quillan
disapprovingly
the
first
lady
mind
he
told
trigger
turns
readily
to
illegal
methods
when
necessary
lyad
said
undisturbed
as
it
is
here
how
about
you
sir
quillan
asked
balmordan
are
we
to
understand
that
you
also
would
be
interested
in
the
purchase
of
a
middling
plasmoid
or
two
i
would
be
naturally
balmordan
said
but
not
at
the
risk
of
causing
trouble
for
my
government
of
course
not
quillan
said
he
thought
a
moment
you
belchy
he
asked
pluly
looked
alarmed
no
no
no
he
said
hastily
he
blinked
wildly
i
stick
to
the
shipping
business
it
safer
quillan
patted
him
fondly
on
the
shoulder
that
one
citizen
in
this
group
he
winked
at
trigger
trigger
wondering
he
told
lyad
why
she
and
i
are
being
told
these
things
well
obviously
lyad
said
trigger
and
you
are
in
an
excellent
position
or
will
be
very
soon
to
act
as
middlemen
in
the
matter
wha
trigger
began
astounded
then
as
all
eyes
swiveled
over
to
her
she
checked
herself
did
you
really
think
she
asked
lyad
that
we
agree
to
such
a
thing
certainly
not
said
lyad
i
do
expect
anyone
to
agree
to
anything
tonight
though
it
a
safe
assumption
i
not
the
only
one
here
who
has
made
sure
this
conversation
is
not
being
recorded
and
will
not
be
available
for
reconstruction
well
quillan
she
smiled
how
right
you
are
first
lady
quillan
said
he
tapped
a
breast
pocket
scrambler
and
distorter
present
and
in
action
and
you
balmordan
i
must
admit
balmordan
said
pleasantly
that
i
thought
it
wise
to
take
certain
precautions
very
wise
said
lyad
her
glance
shifted
with
some
amusement
in
it
to
pluly
belchik
you
a
woman
lyad
belchik
said
unhappily
yes
scrambling
of
course
he
shuddered
i
ca
afford
to
take
chances
not
when
you
around
of
course
not
and
even
so
said
lyad
there
are
still
reasons
why
an
unconsidered
word
might
be
embarrassing
in
this
company
so
no
trigger
i
not
expecting
anybody
to
agree
to
anything
tonight
merely
mentioning
that
i
interested
in
the
purchase
of
plasmoids
incidentally
i
be
very
much
more
interested
even
in
seeing
you
and
quillan
enter
my
employ
directly
yes
belchik
pluly
had
begun
giggling
wildly
i
was
having
the
same
idea
he
gasped
about
one
of
of
anyway
i
he
jerked
and
came
to
an
abrupt
stop
transfixed
by
trigger
stare
then
he
reached
for
his
glass
blinking
at
top
speed
excuse
me
he
muttered
hardly
belchik
said
lyad
she
gave
trigger
a
small
wink
but
i
can
assure
you
trigger
argee
that
you
find
my
pay
and
working
conditions
very
attractive
indeed
it
seemed
a
good
moment
to
look
inscrutable
trigger
did
serious
about
that
lyad
asked
quillan
the
ermetyne
said
certainly
i
serious
both
of
you
could
be
of
great
value
to
me
at
present
she
looked
at
him
a
moment
did
you
ever
happen
to
tell
trigger
about
the
manner
in
which
you
the
family
fortune
not
in
any
great
detail
quillan
said
a
very
good
hijacker
and
smuggler
went
to
waste
when
you
signed
up
with
the
engineers
lyad
said
but
perhaps
not
entirely
to
waste
perhaps
not
acknowledged
quillan
he
grinned
but
i
a
modest
man
one
fortune
enough
for
me
there
was
a
time
you
know
lyad
said
when
i
was
rather
afraid
it
would
be
necessary
to
have
you
killed
quillan
laughed
there
was
a
time
he
admitted
when
i
suspected
you
might
be
thinking
along
those
lines
first
lady
did
lose
too
much
did
you
i
lost
enough
lyad
said
she
wrinkled
her
nose
at
him
but
all
over
and
done
with
and
now
no
more
business
tonight
i
promise
she
turned
her
head
a
little
flam
she
called
yes
first
lady
said
the
voice
of
the
girl
bring
us
miss
argee
property
please
flam
brought
in
a
small
package
of
flat
disks
taped
together
lyad
took
them
sometimes
she
told
quillan
the
askab
becomes
a
little
independent
he
been
spoken
to
here
you
keep
them
for
trigger
she
tossed
the
package
lightly
over
to
them
quillan
put
out
a
hand
and
caught
it
thanks
he
said
he
put
the
package
in
a
pocket
i
call
off
my
beagles
suit
yourself
as
to
that
said
the
ermetyne
it
wo
hurt
the
askab
to
stay
frightened
a
little
longer
she
checked
herself
the
room
comweb
was
signaling
virod
went
over
to
it
a
voice
came
through
the
subspace
run
begins
in
one
hour
rest
cubicles
have
been
prepared
that
means
me
belchik
pluly
said
he
climbed
hastily
to
his
feet
ca
stand
dives
get
hallucinations
nasty
ones
he
staggered
a
little
then
and
trigger
realized
for
the
first
time
that
belchy
had
got
pretty
thoroughly
drunk
better
give
our
guest
a
hand
virod
lyad
called
over
her
shoulder
happy
dreams
belchik
are
you
going
by
rest
trigger
no
you
not
of
course
quillan
balmordan
the
devagas
scientist
also
shook
his
head
then
by
all
means
lyad
said
let
stay
together
a
little
while
longer
she
said
trigger
is
a
remarkable
woman
yeah
said
quillan
remarkable
may
i
ask
you
finally
a
few
pertinent
questions
trigger
inquired
humbly
not
here
sweet
stuff
said
quillan
you
a
bossy
sort
of
slob
heslet
quillan
she
said
equably
quillan
did
answer
they
had
come
down
the
stairway
to
the
storerooms
level
and
were
walking
along
the
big
lit
hallway
toward
their
cabins
trigger
felt
pleasantly
relaxed
but
she
did
have
a
great
many
pertinent
questions
to
ask
quillan
now
and
she
wanted
to
get
started
on
them
oh
she
said
suddenly
just
as
suddenly
quillan
hand
was
on
her
shoulder
moving
her
along
hush
now
he
said
and
keep
walking
but
you
saw
it
did
you
trigger
asked
trying
to
look
back
to
the
small
open
door
into
the
storerooms
they
just
passed
quillan
sighed
certainly
he
said
guy
in
space
armor
but
what
he
doing
there
checking
something
i
suppose
his
hand
left
her
shoulder
and
for
just
a
moment
his
finger
rested
lightly
across
her
lips
trigger
glanced
up
at
him
he
was
walking
on
beside
her
not
looking
at
her
all
right
she
thought
she
could
take
a
hint
but
she
felt
tense
and
uncomfortable
now
something
was
going
on
again
apparently
they
turned
into
the
side
passage
and
came
up
to
her
cabin
trigger
started
to
turn
to
face
him
and
quillan
picked
her
up
and
went
on
without
a
noticeable
break
in
his
stride
close
to
her
ear
his
voice
whispered
explain
in
a
moment
dangerous
here
as
the
door
to
the
end
cabin
closed
behind
them
he
put
her
back
on
her
feet
he
looked
at
his
watch
we
can
talk
here
he
said
but
there
may
not
be
much
time
for
conversation
he
gestured
toward
a
table
against
the
wall
take
a
look
at
the
setup
trigger
looked
the
table
was
littered
with
instruments
like
an
electronic
workbench
a
visual
screen
showed
a
view
of
both
her
own
cabin
and
a
section
of
the
passage
outside
it
up
to
the
point
where
it
entered
the
big
hall
what
is
it
she
asked
uncertainly
essentially
said
quillan
we
set
up
a
catassin
trap
catassin
trigger
squeaked
that
right
do
get
too
nervous
though
i
caught
them
before
used
to
be
a
sort
of
specialty
of
mine
and
there
one
thing
about
them
they
blab
their
pointed
little
heads
off
if
you
can
get
one
alive
and
promise
it
its
catnip
he
shucked
off
his
jacket
and
taken
out
of
it
a
very
large
handgun
with
a
mouth
he
laid
the
gun
down
next
to
the
view
screen
in
case
he
said
unreassuringly
now
just
a
moment
he
sat
down
in
front
of
the
view
screen
and
did
something
to
it
all
right
he
said
then
we
here
and
set
probability
period
starts
in
three
minutes
continues
for
sixty
signal
on
any
blip
otherwise
no
gabbing
and
remember
they
do
get
sappy
there
was
no
answer
quillan
did
something
else
to
the
screen
and
stood
up
again
he
looked
broodingly
at
trigger
it
those
damn
computers
again
he
said
i
do
see
any
sense
in
it
in
what
she
asked
shakily
everything
that
happening
around
here
is
being
fed
back
to
them
at
the
moment
he
said
when
they
heard
about
our
invite
to
lyad
dinner
party
and
who
was
to
be
present
they
came
up
with
a
honey
in
the
time
period
i
mentioned
a
catassin
is
supposed
to
show
up
at
your
cabin
they
give
it
a
pretty
high
probability
trigger
did
say
anything
if
she
had
she
probably
would
have
squeaked
again
now
do
worry
he
said
squeezing
her
shoulder
reassuringly
between
a
large
thumb
and
four
slightly
less
large
fingers
nice
muscle
he
said
absently
the
cabin
trapped
and
i
taken
other
precautions
he
massaged
the
muscle
gently
probably
the
only
thing
that
will
happen
is
that
we
sit
around
here
for
an
hour
or
so
and
then
we
have
a
hearty
laugh
together
at
those
foolish
computers
he
smiled
i
thought
trigger
said
without
squeaking
that
everybody
was
pretty
sure
it
was
dead
quillan
frowned
well
that
something
else
again
there
are
at
least
two
ways
i
know
of
to
sneak
it
past
that
search
jump
it
out
and
in
with
a
subtub
is
one
they
could
have
done
that
from
their
own
cabin
as
soon
as
they
had
its
pattern
so
i
do
really
think
it
dead
it
just
quillan
a
tiny
voice
said
from
the
viewer
he
turned
took
two
steps
and
sat
down
fast
before
the
viewer
go
ahead
fast
motion
in
b
section
going
your
way
fast
motion
a
thought
flicked
up
quillan
trigger
began
he
raised
a
shushing
hand
get
a
silhouette
he
asked
his
hands
went
to
a
set
of
control
switches
and
stayed
there
no
pickup
shows
a
haze
like
in
the
reconstruct
an
instant
pause
leaving
b
section
motion
in
c
section
said
another
voice
quillan
said
all
right
it
coming
no
more
verbal
reports
unless
it
changes
direction
if
you
want
to
stay
alive
do
move
unless
in
armor
there
was
silence
quillan
sat
unmoving
eyes
fixed
on
the
screen
trigger
stood
just
behind
him
her
legs
had
begun
to
tremble
better
tell
him
quillan
for
an
instant
in
the
screen
there
was
something
like
heat
shimmer
at
the
far
end
of
the
passage
then
she
saw
her
cabin
door
pop
open
the
interior
of
the
cabin
showed
in
a
brief
flare
of
blue
light
in
it
was
a
shape
it
vanished
instantly
again
she
heard
quillan
make
a
shocked
incredulous
sound
his
left
hand
slashed
at
a
switch
on
the
panel
twenty
feet
from
them
just
behind
the
closed
door
to
the
passage
was
a
splatting
noise
like
a
tremendous
slap
then
another
noise
strangely
like
a
brief
cloudburst
then
silence
again
she
realized
quillan
was
on
his
feet
beside
her
the
oversized
gun
in
his
hand
it
was
pointed
at
the
door
his
eyes
switched
suddenly
from
the
door
to
the
screen
and
back
again
she
felt
him
relaxing
slowly
then
she
discovered
she
was
clutching
a
handful
of
his
shirt
along
with
a
considerable
chunk
of
tough
skin
she
went
on
clutching
it
fly
swatter
got
it
he
said
whew
he
looked
down
and
patted
the
clutching
hand
no
catassin
the
trap
in
the
cabin
just
was
fast
enough
had
a
gravity
mine
outside
our
door
just
in
case
was
barely
fast
enough
for
once
quillan
looked
almost
awed
trigger
began
she
tried
again
like
a
little
yellow
man
you
saw
it
in
the
cabin
yes
never
saw
anything
just
like
it
before
trigger
pressed
her
lips
together
to
make
them
stay
steady
i
have
she
said
that
what
i
was
trying
to
tell
you
quillan
stared
at
her
for
an
instant
you
tell
me
about
it
in
a
couple
of
minutes
i
got
some
quick
work
to
do
first
he
checked
himself
a
wide
grin
spread
suddenly
over
his
face
know
something
doll
what
the
damn
computers
major
quillan
said
happily
they
goofed
the
gravity
mine
would
have
reduced
almost
any
which
moved
into
its
field
to
a
rather
thin
smear
but
there
was
even
that
left
of
the
yellow
something
presumably
something
it
was
carrying
had
turned
it
into
a
small
blaze
of
incandescent
energy
as
the
mine
flattened
it
out
which
explained
the
sound
like
a
cloudburst
that
had
been
the
passage
automatic
fire
extinguishers
going
into
brief
but
correspondingly
violent
action
quillan
group
stayed
out
of
sight
for
the
time
being
he
barely
got
the
mine
put
away
along
with
a
handful
of
warped
metal
slugs
which
was
what
the
mine
had
left
of
their
attacker
mechanical
equipment
and
trigger
cabin
door
locked
again
when
three
visitors
came
zooming
down
the
storerooms
hall
in
a
small
car
a
ship
engineer
and
two
assistants
had
arrived
to
check
on
what
had
started
the
extinguishers
they
may
quillan
said
hopefully
just
go
away
again
he
and
trigger
were
watching
the
engineers
through
the
viewer
which
had
been
extended
to
cover
their
end
of
the
passage
they
did
just
go
away
again
they
checked
the
extinguishers
looked
at
the
floor
still
wet
but
rapidly
absorbing
the
last
drops
of
the
brief
deluge
they
exchanged
puzzled
comment
they
checked
everything
once
more
finally
the
leader
made
use
of
the
door
announcer
and
asked
if
he
might
intrude
quillan
switched
off
the
viewer
come
in
he
said
resignedly
the
door
opened
the
three
glanced
at
quillan
and
then
at
their
eyes
widened
only
slightly
duty
on
the
dawn
city
produced
hardened
men
neither
quillan
nor
trigger
could
offer
the
slightest
explanation
as
to
what
had
started
the
extinguishers
the
engineers
apologized
and
withdrew
the
door
closed
again
quillan
switched
on
the
viewer
their
voices
came
back
into
the
cabin
as
they
climbed
into
their
car
so
that
how
it
happened
one
of
the
assistants
was
saying
reflectively
right
said
the
ship
engineer
like
to
burst
into
flames
myself
they
drove
off
trigger
flushed
she
looked
at
quillan
perhaps
i
ought
to
get
into
something
else
she
said
now
that
the
party
over
perhaps
quillan
admitted
i
have
gaya
bring
something
down
we
want
to
stay
out
of
your
cabin
for
an
hour
or
so
till
everything
been
checked
there
be
a
few
conferences
to
go
through
now
gaya
arrived
next
with
clothes
trigger
retired
to
the
cabin
bathroom
with
them
and
came
out
a
few
minutes
later
dressed
again
meanwhile
the
dawn
city
first
security
officer
also
had
arrived
and
was
setting
up
a
portable
restructure
stage
in
the
center
of
the
cabin
he
looked
rather
grim
but
he
also
looked
like
a
very
much
relieved
man
i
suggest
we
run
your
sequence
off
first
major
he
said
then
we
can
put
them
on
together
and
compare
them
trigger
sat
down
on
a
couch
beside
gaya
to
watch
she
been
told
that
the
momentary
view
of
the
little
in
the
cabin
had
been
deleted
from
security
copy
of
their
own
sequence
and
was
to
be
mentioned
otherwise
there
really
was
not
too
much
to
see
what
the
attacking
creature
had
used
to
blur
the
restructure
was
clear
except
that
it
was
a
standard
scrambler
amplified
to
the
limits
of
clarity
and
stepped
down
in
time
to
the
limit
of
immobility
all
that
emerged
was
a
shifting
haze
of
energy
which
very
faintly
hinted
at
a
dwarfish
human
shape
in
outline
a
rather
unusually
small
and
heavy
catassin
the
security
chief
pointed
out
would
present
such
an
outline
that
something
quite
material
was
finally
undergoing
devastating
structural
disorganization
on
the
gravity
mine
was
unpleasantly
obvious
but
it
produced
no
further
information
the
sequence
ended
with
the
short
blaze
of
heat
which
had
set
off
the
extinguishers
then
they
ran
the
restructure
of
the
preceding
double
killing
trigger
watched
gulping
a
little
till
it
came
to
the
point
where
the
haze
shape
actually
was
about
to
touch
its
victims
then
she
studied
the
carpet
carefully
until
gaya
nudged
her
to
indicate
the
business
was
over
catassins
almost
invariably
used
their
natural
equipment
in
the
kill
it
was
a
swift
process
of
course
but
shockingly
brutal
and
trigger
did
care
to
remember
what
the
results
looked
like
in
a
human
being
both
men
had
been
killed
in
that
manner
and
the
purpose
obviously
was
to
conceal
the
fact
that
the
killer
was
not
a
catassin
but
something
even
more
efficient
along
those
lines
it
did
occur
to
the
security
chief
to
question
trigger
a
temporal
restructure
of
a
recent
event
was
a
far
more
reliable
witness
than
any
set
of
human
senses
and
memory
mechanisms
he
left
presently
reassured
that
the
catassin
incident
was
concluded
it
startled
trigger
to
realize
that
security
did
not
seem
to
be
considering
seriously
the
possibility
of
discovering
the
human
agent
behind
the
murders
quillan
shrugged
whoever
did
it
is
covered
three
ways
in
every
direction
the
chief
knows
it
he
ca
psych
four
thousand
people
on
general
suspicions
and
he
hit
in
every
twentieth
passenger
presently
on
board
if
he
did
anyway
he
knows
we
on
it
and
that
we
have
a
great
deal
better
chance
of
nailing
the
responsible
characters
eventually
more
information
for
the
computers
eh
trigger
said
you
got
this
little
chunk
the
hard
way
i
feel
she
observed
true
quillan
admitted
but
we
have
to
get
it
any
way
we
can
till
we
get
enough
to
move
on
then
we
move
he
looked
at
her
with
an
air
of
regarding
a
new
idea
you
know
he
said
you
do
do
badly
for
an
amateur
she
does
do
badly
gaya
voice
said
behind
trigger
for
anybody
how
do
you
people
feel
about
a
drink
i
thought
i
could
use
one
myself
after
looking
at
the
chief
restructure
trigger
felt
herself
coloring
praise
from
the
cloak
and
dagger
experts
for
some
reason
it
pleased
her
immensely
she
turned
her
head
to
smile
at
gaya
standing
there
with
three
glasses
on
a
tray
thanks
she
said
she
took
one
of
the
glasses
gaya
held
the
tray
out
to
quillan
and
took
the
third
glass
herself
it
was
some
five
minutes
later
when
trigger
remarked
you
know
getting
sleepy
quillan
looked
around
the
viewer
equipment
he
and
gaya
were
dismantling
why
not
hit
the
couch
over
there
and
take
a
nap
he
suggested
be
about
an
hour
before
the
boys
can
get
down
here
for
the
real
conference
good
idea
trigger
yawned
finished
her
drink
put
the
glass
on
a
table
and
wandered
over
to
the
couch
she
stretched
out
on
it
a
drowsy
somnolence
enveloped
her
almost
instantly
she
closed
her
eyes
ten
minutes
later
gaya
standing
over
her
announced
well
out
fine
said
quillan
packaging
the
rest
of
the
equipment
tell
them
to
haul
in
the
rest
cubicle
i
be
done
here
in
a
minute
then
you
and
the
lady
warden
can
take
over
gaya
looked
down
at
trigger
there
was
a
trace
of
regret
in
her
face
i
think
she
said
she
going
to
be
fairly
displeased
with
you
when
she
wakes
up
and
finds
she
on
manon
would
doubt
it
said
quillan
but
from
what
i
seen
of
that
chick
she
going
to
get
fairly
displeased
with
me
from
time
to
time
on
this
operation
anyway
gaya
looked
at
his
back
major
quillan
she
said
would
you
like
a
tip
from
a
operator
go
ahead
ole
op
quillan
said
in
kindly
tones
not
that
you
do
have
it
coming
boy
said
gaya
but
watch
yourself
this
one
is
dangerous
this
one
could
sink
you
for
keeps
you
going
out
of
your
mind
doll
said
quillan
the
precol
headquarters
dome
on
manon
planet
was
still
in
the
spot
where
trigger
had
left
it
looking
unchanged
but
everything
else
in
the
area
seemed
to
have
been
moved
improved
expanded
or
taken
away
entirely
and
unfamiliar
features
had
appeared
in
the
screens
of
commissioner
tate
precol
offices
trigger
could
see
both
the
new
spaceport
on
which
the
dawn
city
had
set
down
that
morning
and
the
towering
glassy
structures
of
the
giant
shopping
and
recreation
center
which
had
been
opened
here
recently
by
grand
commerce
in
its
bid
for
a
cut
of
prospective
outworld
salaries
the
salaries
were
entirely
prospective
either
ten
miles
away
on
the
other
side
of
headquarters
dome
new
squares
of
living
domes
were
sprouting
up
daily
at
this
morning
count
they
housed
thousand
people
the
hub
major
industries
and
assorted
branches
of
federation
government
had
established
a
solid
foothold
on
manon
trigger
turned
her
head
as
holati
tate
came
into
the
office
he
closed
the
door
carefully
behind
him
how
the
little
critter
doing
he
asked
still
absorbing
the
goop
trigger
said
she
held
mantelish
small
mystery
plasmoid
cupped
lightly
between
thumbs
and
fingers
its
bottom
side
down
in
a
shallow
bowl
half
full
of
something
which
mantelish
considered
to
be
nutritive
for
plasmoids
or
at
least
for
this
one
its
sides
pulsed
lightly
and
regularly
against
her
palms
the
level
of
the
stuff
keeps
going
down
she
added
good
said
holati
he
pulled
a
chair
up
to
the
table
and
sat
down
opposite
her
he
looked
broodingly
at
plasmoid
you
really
think
this
thing
me
personally
trigger
inquired
her
boss
said
it
eating
is
it
and
moving
there
were
a
couple
of
days
before
you
got
here
when
it
looked
pretty
dead
to
me
hard
to
believe
trigger
observed
that
a
sort
of
thing
could
distinguish
between
people
this
one
can
do
you
get
any
sensations
while
holding
it
sensations
she
considered
nothing
particular
it
just
like
i
said
the
other
time
little
repulsive
is
rather
nice
to
feel
for
you
he
said
i
did
tell
you
everything
you
rarely
do
trigger
remarked
i
tell
you
now
said
holati
the
day
after
we
left
when
it
started
acting
very
agitated
and
then
very
droopy
mantelish
said
it
might
be
missing
the
female
touch
it
had
got
from
you
he
was
being
facetious
i
think
but
i
could
see
any
reason
not
to
try
it
so
i
called
in
your
facsimile
and
had
her
sit
down
at
the
table
where
the
thing
was
lying
yes
well
first
it
came
flying
up
to
her
crying
not
actually
of
course
then
it
touched
her
hand
and
recoiled
in
horror
trigger
raised
an
eyebrow
it
looked
like
it
he
insisted
we
all
commented
on
it
so
then
she
reached
out
and
touched
it
then
she
recoiled
in
horror
why
she
said
it
had
given
her
a
very
nasty
electric
jolt
apparently
like
the
one
it
gave
mantelish
trigger
glanced
down
dubiously
at
repulsive
gee
thanks
for
letting
me
hold
it
holati
it
seems
to
have
stopped
eating
now
by
the
way
or
whatever
it
does
does
look
much
fatter
if
any
does
it
the
commissioner
looked
no
he
said
and
if
you
weighed
it
probably
find
it
still
weighs
an
exact
three
and
a
half
pounds
mantelish
feels
the
thing
turns
any
food
intake
directly
into
energy
then
it
should
be
able
to
produce
a
very
nice
jolt
at
the
moment
trigger
commented
now
what
do
i
do
with
repulsive
holati
took
a
towel
from
beneath
the
table
and
spread
it
out
absorbent
material
he
said
lay
it
on
that
and
just
let
it
dry
that
what
we
used
to
do
trigger
shook
her
head
next
thing
i
be
changing
its
diapers
it
is
that
bad
the
commissioner
said
anyway
you
will
adopt
baby
wo
you
i
suppose
i
have
to
she
placed
the
plasmoid
on
the
towel
wiped
her
hands
and
stepped
back
from
it
what
happens
if
it
falls
on
the
floor
nothing
holati
said
it
just
moves
on
in
the
direction
it
was
going
pretty
hard
to
hurt
those
things
in
that
case
trigger
said
let
check
out
its
container
now
the
commissioner
took
repulsive
container
out
of
a
desk
safe
and
handed
it
to
her
its
outer
appearance
was
that
of
a
neat
modern
handbag
with
a
shoulder
strap
it
had
an
antigrav
setting
which
would
reduce
its
overall
weight
with
the
plasmoid
inside
down
to
nine
ounces
if
trigger
wanted
it
that
way
it
also
had
a
combination
lock
unmarked
virtually
invisible
the
settings
of
which
trigger
already
had
memorized
without
knowing
the
settings
a
determined
man
using
a
needle
blaster
might
have
opened
the
handbag
in
around
nine
hours
a
very
special
job
trigger
ran
through
the
settings
opened
the
container
and
peered
inside
rather
cramped
she
observed
not
for
one
of
them
we
needed
room
for
the
gadgetry
yes
she
said
subspace
rotation
she
shook
her
head
is
that
another
space
scout
invention
no
said
holati
they
stole
it
from
subspace
engineers
engineers
do
know
we
have
it
yet
far
as
i
know
nobody
else
has
got
it
from
them
go
ahead
give
it
a
try
i
was
going
to
trigger
snapped
the
container
shut
slipped
the
strap
over
her
shoulder
and
stood
straight
left
hand
closed
over
the
lower
rim
of
the
purselike
object
she
shifted
the
ball
of
her
thumb
and
the
tip
of
her
middle
finger
to
the
correct
spots
and
began
to
apply
pressure
then
she
started
handbag
and
strap
had
vanished
feels
odd
she
smiled
and
to
bring
it
back
i
just
have
to
be
here
the
same
place
and
say
those
words
he
nodded
want
to
try
that
now
trigger
waved
her
left
hand
gently
through
the
air
beside
her
what
happens
she
asked
if
the
thing
surfaces
exactly
where
my
hand
happens
to
be
it
wo
surface
if
there
anything
bulkier
than
a
few
dust
motes
in
the
way
that
one
improvement
the
sub
engineers
have
heard
about
yet
well
she
glanced
around
picked
up
a
plastic
ruler
from
the
desk
behind
her
and
moved
back
a
cautious
step
she
waved
the
ruler
tip
gingerly
about
in
the
area
where
the
handbag
had
been
come
fido
she
said
nothing
happened
she
drew
the
ruler
back
come
fido
handbag
and
strap
materialized
in
and
thumped
to
the
floor
convinced
holati
asked
he
picked
up
the
handbag
and
gave
it
back
to
her
it
seems
to
work
how
long
will
that
little
plasmoid
last
if
it
left
in
subspace
like
that
he
shrugged
indefinitely
probably
they
tough
we
know
that
hours
at
a
stretch
wo
bother
it
in
the
least
so
set
that
as
the
limit
it
to
stay
rotated
except
in
emergencies
and
you
and
one
other
person
i
not
to
know
about
but
who
anywhere
near
here
can
also
bring
it
back
yes
if
we
know
the
place
from
which
it
been
rotated
so
the
agreement
is
that
again
except
in
absolute
emergencies
it
will
be
rotated
only
from
one
of
the
six
points
specified
and
known
to
all
three
of
us
trigger
nodded
she
opened
the
container
and
went
over
to
the
table
where
the
plasmoid
still
lay
on
its
towel
it
was
dry
by
now
she
picked
it
up
you
a
lot
of
trouble
repulsive
she
told
it
but
these
people
think
you
must
be
worth
it
she
slipped
it
into
the
container
and
it
seemed
to
snuggle
down
comfortably
inside
trigger
closed
the
handbag
lightened
it
to
half
its
normal
weight
slipped
the
strap
back
over
her
left
shoulder
and
now
she
inquired
what
am
i
to
do
with
the
stuff
i
usually
keep
in
a
purse
you
be
in
precol
uniform
while
you
here
we
had
a
special
uniform
made
for
you
extra
pockets
trigger
sighed
oh
they
quite
inconspicuous
and
convenient
he
assured
her
we
checked
with
the
girls
on
that
i
bet
she
said
did
they
okay
the
porgee
pouch
too
sure
porgee
doping
is
a
big
thing
all
over
the
hub
at
the
moment
among
the
ladies
anyway
shows
you
the
delicate
sort
or
something
like
that
i
forget
what
they
said
want
to
start
carrying
it
hand
it
over
trigger
said
resignedly
i
did
see
quite
a
few
pouches
on
the
ship
might
as
well
get
people
used
to
thinking
i
turned
into
a
porgee
sniffer
holati
went
back
to
the
desk
safe
and
took
out
a
flat
pouch
the
length
of
his
hand
but
narrower
he
gave
it
to
her
it
appeared
to
be
worked
of
gold
thread
one
side
was
studded
with
tiny
pearls
the
opposite
surface
was
plain
trigger
laid
the
plain
side
against
the
cloth
of
her
skirt
just
below
the
right
hip
and
let
go
it
adhered
there
she
stretched
her
right
leg
out
to
the
side
and
considered
the
porgee
pouch
does
look
too
bad
she
conceded
that
real
porgee
in
the
top
section
the
real
article
close
to
nine
hundred
and
fifty
credits
worth
suppose
somebody
wants
to
borrow
a
sniff
would
be
good
to
have
them
fumbling
around
the
pouch
very
much
they
ca
said
the
commissioner
that
why
we
made
it
porgee
when
you
buy
a
supply
it
has
to
be
adjusted
to
your
individual
chemistry
exactly
that
mainly
what
makes
it
expensive
try
using
someone
else
and
it
flip
you
across
the
room
better
get
this
adjusted
to
my
chemistry
then
i
might
have
to
take
a
demonstration
sniff
now
and
then
to
make
it
look
right
we
already
done
that
he
said
good
said
trigger
now
let
see
she
straightened
up
left
hand
closed
lightly
around
the
bottom
of
the
purse
right
hand
loose
at
her
side
her
eyes
searched
the
office
briefly
some
object
around
here
you
do
particularly
value
she
asked
something
largish
several
the
commissioner
said
he
glanced
around
that
overgrown
flower
pot
in
the
corner
is
one
why
just
practicing
said
trigger
she
turned
to
face
the
flower
pot
that
will
do
now
here
i
come
along
thinking
of
nothing
she
started
walking
toward
the
flower
pot
then
suddenly
in
front
of
me
there
stands
a
plasmoid
snatcher
she
stopped
in
handbag
and
strap
vanished
as
her
right
hand
slapped
the
porgee
pouch
the
denton
popped
into
her
palm
the
flower
pot
screeched
and
flew
apart
golly
she
said
startled
come
fido
handbag
and
strap
reappeared
and
she
reached
out
and
caught
the
strap
she
looked
around
at
commissioner
tate
sorry
about
your
pot
holati
i
was
just
going
to
shake
it
up
a
little
i
forgot
you
people
had
been
handling
my
gun
i
keep
it
switched
to
stunner
myself
when
i
carrying
it
she
added
pointedly
perfectly
all
right
about
the
pot
the
commissioner
said
i
should
have
warned
you
otherwise
i
say
all
you
need
is
a
moment
to
see
them
coming
trigger
spun
the
denton
to
its
stunner
setting
and
laid
it
back
inside
the
slit
which
had
appeared
along
the
side
of
the
porgee
pouch
she
ran
thumb
and
finger
tip
along
the
length
of
the
slit
and
the
pouch
was
sealed
again
that
the
part
that
worrying
me
she
admitted
when
trigger
presented
herself
at
commissioner
tate
personal
quarters
early
that
evening
she
found
him
alone
sit
down
he
said
i
been
trying
to
get
hold
of
mantelish
for
the
past
hour
he
over
on
the
other
side
of
the
planet
again
trigger
sat
down
and
lifted
an
eyebrow
should
he
be
i
do
think
so
said
holati
but
i
been
overruled
on
that
still
the
best
man
the
federation
has
working
on
the
various
plasmoid
problems
so
i
not
to
interfere
with
his
investigations
any
more
than
i
can
show
is
absolutely
necessary
it
probably
all
right
those
guards
of
his
are
a
bad
group
if
they
compare
with
the
boys
the
league
had
watching
the
plasmoid
project
they
should
be
just
about
tops
trigger
said
the
space
scouts
thank
you
for
those
kind
words
the
commissioner
told
her
those
were
league
guards
when
it
came
to
deciding
who
was
to
keep
an
eye
on
you
i
overruled
everybody
she
smiled
i
might
have
guessed
it
what
there
for
the
professor
to
be
investigating
on
the
other
side
of
manon
he
hunting
for
some
theoretical
creatures
he
calls
wild
plasmoids
plasmoids
his
idea
is
that
some
of
the
plasmoids
the
old
galactics
were
using
on
manon
might
have
got
away
from
them
or
just
been
left
lying
around
so
to
speak
and
could
have
survived
till
now
he
thinks
they
might
even
be
reproducing
themselves
he
looking
for
them
with
a
special
detector
he
built
trigger
held
up
a
finger
on
which
was
a
slim
gold
ring
with
a
small
green
stone
in
it
like
this
one
she
asked
he
got
a
large
version
of
that
type
of
detector
with
him
too
but
he
thinks
that
if
any
wild
plasmoids
are
around
they
likely
to
be
along
the
lines
of
so
he
also
constructed
a
detector
which
reacts
to
i
see
trigger
was
silent
a
moment
does
mantelish
have
any
idea
why
repulsive
is
the
only
plasmoid
known
to
which
our
ring
detectors
react
apparently
he
does
holati
said
but
when
he
starts
in
on
those
subjects
i
find
him
difficult
to
follow
he
looked
soberly
at
trigger
there
are
times
he
confessed
when
i
suspect
professor
mantelish
is
somewhat
daft
but
probably
he
just
so
brilliant
that
he
keeps
fading
beyond
my
mental
range
trigger
laughed
my
father
used
to
come
home
from
a
session
with
mantelish
muttering
the
same
sort
of
thing
she
glanced
at
the
ring
again
by
the
way
have
any
plasmoids
actually
been
stolen
around
here
for
us
to
detect
he
nodded
quite
a
few
have
been
snitched
from
harvest
moon
and
various
storage
points
by
now
i
would
be
surprised
if
some
of
them
turn
up
here
in
the
dome
eventually
not
that
it
a
serious
loss
what
the
thieves
have
been
getting
away
with
is
small
stuff
plasmoid
nuts
and
bolts
so
to
speak
still
each
of
those
would
still
fetch
around
a
hundred
thousand
credits
if
you
offered
them
to
the
right
people
incidentally
if
asking
you
to
this
conference
has
interfered
with
any
personal
plans
just
say
so
we
can
put
it
off
till
tomorrow
especially
since
it
beginning
to
look
as
if
mantelish
wo
make
it
here
either
either
trigger
said
quillan
already
had
to
cancel
he
got
involved
with
something
during
the
afternoon
oh
she
said
coolly
she
looked
at
her
watch
i
do
have
a
dinner
date
with
brule
inger
in
an
hour
and
a
half
but
you
said
this
meeting
to
take
more
than
an
hour
anyway
did
you
he
nodded
then
i
free
my
quarters
are
arranged
and
i
ready
to
go
back
on
my
old
job
in
the
morning
fine
said
the
commissioner
there
are
things
i
wanted
to
discuss
with
you
privately
anyway
if
we
ca
get
through
to
mantelish
in
another
ten
minutes
we
go
ahead
with
that
i
would
have
liked
to
have
quillan
here
to
fill
us
in
with
data
about
some
of
the
crooks
in
the
hub
they
a
specialty
of
his
i
do
know
too
much
about
them
myself
he
paused
that
lyad
ermetyne
now
he
said
looks
as
if
she
either
already
is
part
of
the
main
problem
or
is
working
very
hard
to
get
there
she
had
a
tranest
warship
stationed
here
for
the
past
two
weeks
a
thing
called
the
aurora
trigger
was
startled
but
warships
are
allowed
in
manon
system
it
is
in
the
system
it
stationed
a
half
away
where
it
has
a
legal
right
to
be
nothing
to
worry
about
as
such
it
just
a
heavy
armed
frigate
which
is
the
limit
tranest
is
allowed
to
build
since
it
lyad
private
boat
i
imagine
it
been
souped
up
with
everything
they
could
throw
in
anyway
the
fact
that
she
sent
it
here
ahead
of
her
indicates
she
is
just
dropping
in
for
a
casual
visit
she
made
that
pretty
clear
herself
trigger
said
why
do
you
think
she
being
so
open
about
it
he
shrugged
might
have
a
number
of
reasons
one
could
be
that
get
the
beady
eye
anyway
as
soon
as
she
showed
up
here
when
lyad
goes
anywhere
it
usually
on
business
after
quillan
reported
on
your
dinner
party
i
got
all
the
information
i
could
on
her
the
first
lady
stacks
up
as
a
tough
cookie
also
smart
most
of
those
ermetynes
wind
up
being
by
some
loving
relative
and
apparently
they
have
to
know
how
to
whip
up
a
sharp
brew
of
poison
before
they
let
into
kindergarten
lyad
been
top
dog
among
them
since
she
was
eighteen
his
head
turned
a
bell
had
begun
pinging
in
the
next
room
he
stood
up
probably
mantelish
outfit
on
the
transmitter
he
said
i
told
them
to
call
as
soon
as
they
located
him
he
stopped
at
the
door
care
for
a
drink
trigger
girl
you
know
where
the
stuff
is
not
just
now
thanks
the
commissioner
came
back
in
a
couple
of
minutes
darn
fool
got
lost
in
a
swamp
they
found
him
finally
but
he
too
tired
to
come
over
now
he
sat
down
and
scratched
his
chin
thoughtfully
do
you
remember
the
time
you
passed
out
on
the
harvest
moon
he
asked
trigger
looked
at
him
puzzled
the
time
i
what
passed
out
fainted
went
out
cold
i
you
out
of
your
mind
holati
i
never
fainted
in
my
life
reason
i
asked
he
said
is
that
i
been
told
a
spell
in
a
rest
cubicle
same
thing
as
a
rest
cubicle
anyway
only
it
used
for
therapy
sometimes
resolves
amnesias
amnesias
what
you
talking
about
the
commissioner
said
i
talking
about
you
this
is
bound
to
be
a
jolt
trigger
girl
might
have
been
easier
after
a
drink
but
i
just
give
it
to
you
straight
about
a
week
after
mantelish
and
his
crew
first
arrived
here
you
did
pass
out
on
one
occasion
while
we
were
on
the
harvest
moon
with
them
and
afterwards
you
did
remember
doing
it
i
did
trigger
said
weakly
no
i
thought
it
might
have
cleared
up
and
you
just
had
some
reason
for
not
wanting
to
mention
it
he
got
to
his
feet
like
that
drink
now
before
i
go
on
with
the
details
she
nodded
holati
tate
brought
her
the
drink
and
went
on
with
the
details
trigger
and
he
and
a
dozen
or
so
of
the
first
group
of
investigators
had
been
in
what
was
now
designated
as
section
of
harvest
moon
the
commissioner
was
by
himself
checking
over
some
equipment
which
had
been
installed
in
one
of
the
compartments
after
a
while
doctor
azol
joined
him
and
told
him
mantelish
and
the
others
had
gone
on
to
another
section
holati
and
azol
finished
the
together
and
were
about
to
leave
the
area
to
catch
up
with
the
group
when
holati
saw
trigger
lying
on
the
floor
in
an
adjoining
compartment
you
seemed
to
be
in
some
kind
of
coma
he
said
we
picked
you
up
and
put
you
into
a
chair
by
one
of
the
survey
screens
and
were
trying
to
get
out
a
call
on
azol
suit
communicator
to
the
ambulance
boat
when
you
suddenly
opened
your
eyes
you
looked
at
me
and
said
there
you
are
i
was
just
going
to
go
looking
for
you
it
was
obvious
that
you
did
realize
anything
unusual
had
happened
azol
started
to
say
something
but
i
stepped
on
his
foot
and
he
caught
on
in
fact
he
caught
on
so
fast
that
i
became
a
little
suspicious
of
him
poor
azol
trigger
said
poor
nothing
the
commissioner
said
cryptically
i
tell
you
about
that
some
other
time
i
cautioned
doctor
azol
to
say
nothing
to
anybody
until
the
incident
had
been
clarified
in
view
of
the
stringent
security
precautions
being
practiced
supposedly
being
practiced
he
amended
then
he
returned
to
manon
planet
with
trigger
immediately
where
she
was
checked
over
by
precol
medical
staff
physically
there
was
a
thing
wrong
with
her
and
that
said
trigger
feeling
a
little
frightened
is
something
else
i
do
remember
well
you
would
the
commissioner
said
you
were
fed
a
first
you
went
out
for
three
hours
when
you
woke
up
you
thought
been
having
a
good
nap
since
the
medics
were
sure
you
had
picked
up
some
odd
plasmoid
infection
i
wanted
to
know
just
what
else
had
happened
on
harvest
moon
one
of
those
scientific
big
shots
might
also
have
used
a
on
you
with
the
idea
of
turning
you
into
a
conditioned
assistant
for
future
shenanigans
trigger
grinned
faintly
you
do
have
a
suspicious
mind
the
grin
faded
was
that
what
they
were
going
to
find
out
in
that
interview
on
maccadon
i
skipped
out
on
it
one
of
the
things
they
might
have
looked
for
he
agreed
trigger
gazed
at
him
very
thoughtfully
for
a
moment
well
i
loused
that
deal
up
she
remarked
but
why
is
everybody
she
shook
her
head
excuse
me
go
on
the
commissioner
went
on
old
doc
leeharvis
was
handling
the
hypnosis
herself
she
hit
what
she
thought
might
be
a
when
she
tried
to
get
you
to
remember
what
happened
we
know
now
it
was
a
but
she
would
monkey
with
you
any
farther
and
told
me
to
get
in
an
expert
so
i
called
the
psychology
service
headquarters
on
orado
trigger
looked
startled
then
laughed
the
eggheads
you
went
right
to
the
top
there
did
you
tried
to
said
holati
tate
it
a
good
idea
when
you
want
real
service
they
told
me
to
stay
calm
and
to
say
nothing
to
you
an
expert
would
be
shipped
out
promptly
was
he
yes
trigger
eyes
narrowed
a
little
same
old
treatment
right
said
commissioner
tate
he
came
sprayed
investigated
then
he
told
me
to
stay
calm
and
went
off
looking
puzzled
puzzled
she
said
if
i
had
known
before
that
experts
come
in
all
grades
the
commissioner
said
i
know
it
now
that
first
one
they
sent
was
just
sharp
enough
to
realize
there
might
be
something
involved
in
the
case
he
was
getting
but
that
was
all
trigger
was
silent
a
moment
so
there
been
more
of
those
investigations
i
do
know
about
she
observed
her
voice
taking
on
an
edge
the
commissioner
said
cautiously
how
many
seven
trigger
flushed
straightened
up
eyes
blazing
and
pronounced
a
very
unladylike
word
excuse
me
she
added
a
moment
later
i
got
carried
away
perfectly
all
right
said
the
commissioner
i
been
getting
just
a
bit
fed
up
anyway
trigger
went
on
voice
and
color
still
high
with
people
knocking
me
for
a
loop
one
way
or
another
whenever
they
happen
to
feel
like
it
do
blame
you
a
bit
he
said
and
please
do
think
i
do
appreciate
your
calling
in
all
those
experts
i
do
it
just
their
sneaky
underhanded
secretive
methods
i
do
go
for
exactly
how
i
feel
about
it
said
the
commissioner
trigger
stared
at
him
suspiciously
you
a
pretty
sneaky
type
yourself
she
said
well
excuse
the
blowup
holati
they
probably
had
some
reason
for
it
have
they
found
out
anything
at
all
with
all
the
spraying
and
investigating
oh
yes
they
seem
to
have
made
considerable
progress
the
last
report
i
had
from
them
about
a
month
ago
shows
that
the
original
amnesia
has
been
completely
resolved
trigger
looked
surprised
if
it
been
resolved
she
said
reasonably
why
do
i
remember
what
happened
you
are
supposed
to
become
conscious
of
it
before
the
final
interview
i
do
know
the
reason
for
that
but
the
memory
is
available
now
on
tap
so
to
speak
they
give
you
a
cue
and
then
remember
it
just
like
that
eh
she
paused
so
the
psychology
service
is
whatzzit
whatzzit
said
the
commissioner
she
explained
about
whatzzit
he
grinned
yes
he
said
they
the
ones
who
been
giving
the
instructions
as
far
as
you
concerned
trigger
was
silent
a
moment
i
heard
she
said
the
eggheads
have
terrific
pull
when
they
want
to
use
it
you
do
hear
much
about
them
otherwise
let
me
think
just
a
little
go
ahead
said
holati
a
minute
ticked
away
what
it
boils
down
to
so
far
trigger
said
then
is
still
pretty
much
what
you
told
me
on
maccadon
the
psychology
service
thinks
i
know
something
that
might
help
clean
up
the
plasmoid
problem
or
at
least
help
explain
it
he
nodded
and
the
people
who
been
trying
to
grab
me
very
probably
are
doing
it
for
exactly
the
same
reason
he
nodded
again
that
almost
certain
do
you
think
the
eggheads
might
already
have
figured
out
what
the
connection
is
the
commissioner
shook
his
head
if
they
had
we
be
doing
something
about
it
the
federation
council
is
very
nervous
well
trigger
said
she
pursed
her
lips
that
lyad
she
said
what
about
her
she
tried
to
hire
me
said
trigger
major
quillan
reported
it
i
suppose
sure
and
it
would
be
just
to
steal
some
stupid
plasmoid
especially
since
you
say
a
number
of
small
ones
are
already
available
then
there
the
ones
that
raiders
picked
up
in
the
hub
she
probably
has
a
collection
by
now
he
nodded
probably
she
seems
to
know
quite
a
bit
about
what
been
going
on
very
likely
she
does
let
grab
her
said
trigger
we
can
do
it
quietly
and
she
too
big
to
be
we
get
part
of
the
answer
perhaps
all
of
it
something
flared
briefly
in
the
commissioner
small
gray
eyes
he
reached
over
and
patted
her
knee
you
a
girl
after
my
own
heart
trigger
girl
he
said
i
for
it
but
half
the
council
would
have
fainted
dead
away
if
they
heard
you
make
that
suggestion
they
as
touchy
as
that
she
asked
disappointed
yes
and
you
ca
quite
blame
them
fumbles
could
be
pretty
bad
when
it
comes
to
someone
around
lyad
level
our
own
group
is
restricted
to
defensive
counteraction
if
we
get
evidence
against
her
it
be
up
to
the
diplomats
to
decide
what
to
be
done
about
it
tactfully
we
would
be
further
involved
trigger
nodded
watching
him
go
on
well
defensive
counteraction
can
cover
a
lot
of
things
of
course
if
we
actually
run
into
the
first
lady
while
we
engaged
in
it
hold
her
as
long
as
we
can
and
from
all
accounts
now
that
showed
up
to
take
personal
charge
of
things
around
here
we
can
expect
some
very
fast
very
direct
action
from
lyad
how
fast
my
own
guess
said
the
commissioner
would
be
around
a
week
if
she
has
moved
by
then
we
might
help
things
along
a
little
make
a
few
of
those
openings
for
her
eh
well
that
does
sound
too
bad
trigger
reflected
then
there
point
number
two
she
said
what
that
she
grimaced
i
not
real
keen
on
it
she
confessed
but
i
think
we
better
do
something
about
that
interview
with
whatzzit
i
ducked
out
of
if
they
still
want
to
talk
to
me
they
do
very
much
so
what
that
business
about
their
saying
it
was
okay
now
for
me
to
go
on
to
manon
commissioner
tate
tugged
gently
at
his
left
ear
lobe
frankly
he
said
that
something
that
shook
me
a
little
shook
you
why
it
that
matter
of
experts
coming
in
grades
the
upper
ranks
in
the
psychology
service
are
extremely
busy
people
i
understand
after
your
first
interview
we
were
shifted
upward
promptly
a
couple
of
middling
investigators
took
over
for
a
while
but
after
the
fourth
interview
i
was
told
i
have
to
bring
you
to
the
hub
to
let
somebody
really
competent
handle
the
next
stage
of
whatever
they
been
doing
they
said
they
could
spare
anybody
of
that
caliber
for
a
trip
to
manon
was
the
real
reason
we
went
to
maccadon
trigger
asked
startled
sure
but
we
still
had
got
anywhere
near
the
service
top
level
then
as
i
get
it
their
topnotchers
do
spend
much
time
on
individual
cases
they
keep
busy
with
things
on
the
scale
of
our
more
bothersome
planetary
cultures
and
there
are
supposed
to
be
only
a
hundred
or
so
of
them
in
that
category
so
i
was
more
than
a
little
surprised
when
the
service
informed
me
finally
one
of
those
people
was
coming
to
maccadon
to
conduct
your
ninth
interview
one
of
the
real
eggheads
trigger
smiled
nervously
and
then
i
just
took
off
they
ca
have
too
good
an
opinion
of
me
at
the
moment
you
know
apparently
that
did
upset
them
in
the
least
the
commissioner
said
they
told
me
to
stay
calm
and
make
sure
you
got
to
manon
all
right
then
they
said
they
had
a
ship
operating
in
this
area
and
route
it
over
to
manon
after
you
arrived
here
a
ship
trigger
asked
i
seen
a
few
of
their
ships
they
looked
like
oversized
flying
mountains
camouflage
jobs
what
they
actually
are
is
spacegoing
superlaboratories
from
what
i
heard
this
one
has
a
couple
of
those
topnotchers
on
board
and
one
of
them
will
take
you
on
it
due
here
in
a
day
or
so
trigger
had
paled
somewhat
you
know
she
said
i
feel
a
little
shaken
myself
now
i
not
surprised
said
the
commissioner
she
shook
her
head
well
if
they
topnotchers
they
must
know
what
they
doing
she
gave
him
a
smile
looks
like
i
something
extremely
unusual
like
a
bothersome
planetary
culture
weak
joke
she
added
the
commissioner
ignored
the
weak
joke
there
another
thing
he
said
thoughtfully
what
that
when
i
mentioned
your
reluctance
about
being
interviewed
they
told
me
not
to
worry
about
it
that
you
would
try
to
duck
out
again
why
i
was
surprised
when
you
brought
up
the
matter
of
the
interview
yourself
just
now
now
that
is
odd
trigger
admitted
after
a
pause
how
would
they
know
right
he
said
he
sighed
guess
we
both
a
little
out
of
our
depth
there
i
come
close
to
getting
impatient
with
them
a
few
times
had
the
feeling
they
were
stalling
me
off
and
holding
back
information
but
presumably
they
do
know
what
they
doing
he
glanced
at
his
watch
that
hour
about
up
now
by
the
way
well
if
there
something
else
that
should
be
discussed
i
can
break
my
dinner
date
trigger
said
somewhat
reluctantly
i
had
a
chance
to
talk
with
brule
at
the
spaceport
for
a
while
when
we
came
in
this
morning
i
was
suggesting
that
said
holati
there
still
are
things
to
be
discussed
but
a
few
hours
one
way
or
the
other
wo
make
any
difference
we
get
together
again
around
lunch
tomorrow
then
be
filled
in
pretty
well
on
all
the
main
points
of
this
business
trigger
nodded
fine
what
i
had
in
mind
right
now
was
that
the
service
people
suggested
having
you
look
over
their
last
report
on
you
after
your
arrival
have
just
enough
time
for
that
before
going
to
keep
your
date
care
to
do
it
i
certainly
would
trigger
said
the
transmitter
signaled
for
attention
while
she
was
studying
the
report
holati
tate
went
off
to
answer
it
the
report
was
rather
lengthy
and
trigger
was
still
going
over
it
when
he
got
back
he
sat
down
again
and
waited
when
she
looked
up
finally
he
asked
can
you
make
much
sense
of
it
not
very
much
trigger
admitted
it
just
states
what
seems
to
have
happened
not
how
or
why
apparently
they
did
get
me
to
develop
a
total
recall
of
that
period
in
the
last
interview
i
even
reported
hearing
you
and
doctor
azol
moving
around
and
talking
in
the
next
compartment
he
nodded
i
remember
enough
of
my
conversation
with
azol
to
be
able
to
verify
that
part
of
it
then
some
time
before
i
actually
fell
down
said
trigger
i
was
apparently
already
in
that
mysterious
coma
getting
deeper
into
it
it
started
when
i
walked
away
from
mantelish
group
without
having
any
particular
reason
for
doing
it
i
just
walked
then
i
was
in
another
compartment
by
myself
and
still
walking
and
the
stuff
kept
getting
deeper
until
i
lost
physical
control
of
myself
and
fell
down
then
i
lay
there
a
while
until
you
came
down
that
aisle
and
saw
me
and
after
you
picked
me
up
and
put
me
in
that
chair
just
like
that
everything
clears
up
except
that
i
do
remember
what
happened
and
think
just
left
mantelish
to
go
looking
for
you
i
do
even
wonder
how
i
happen
to
be
sitting
there
in
a
chair
the
commissioner
smiled
briefly
that
right
you
did
her
slim
fingers
tapped
the
pages
of
the
report
the
green
stone
in
the
ring
he
given
her
to
wear
reflecting
little
flashes
of
light
they
seem
quite
positive
that
nobody
else
came
near
me
during
that
period
and
that
nobody
had
used
a
on
me
or
shot
a
hypodermic
pellet
into
me
anything
like
that
before
the
seizure
or
whatever
it
was
came
on
how
do
you
suppose
they
could
be
so
sure
of
that
i
would
know
holati
said
but
i
think
we
might
as
well
assume
they
right
i
suppose
so
what
it
seems
to
boil
down
to
is
they
saying
i
was
undergoing
something
like
a
very
much
very
profound
emotional
shock
source
still
undetermined
but
profound
enough
to
knock
me
completely
out
for
a
while
only
they
also
say
that
for
a
whole
list
of
reasons
it
could
possibly
have
been
an
emotional
shock
after
all
and
when
the
effect
left
it
went
instantaneously
that
would
be
just
the
reverse
to
the
pattern
of
an
emotional
shock
would
it
yes
he
said
that
occurred
to
me
too
but
it
did
explain
anything
to
me
possibly
it
explained
something
to
the
psychology
service
well
trigger
said
it
certainly
all
very
odd
very
disagreeable
too
she
laid
the
report
down
on
the
arm
of
her
chair
and
looked
at
the
commissioner
guess
i
better
run
now
she
said
but
there
was
something
you
said
before
that
made
me
wonder
there
was
really
very
little
of
doctor
azol
left
after
that
plasmoid
got
through
with
him
he
nodded
true
it
was
azol
was
it
no
man
oh
man
trigger
jumped
up
bent
over
his
chair
and
gave
him
a
quick
peck
on
an
ear
tip
if
i
ask
one
more
question
we
be
sitting
here
the
next
two
hours
i
run
instead
see
you
around
lunchtime
commissioner
right
trigger
he
said
getting
up
he
closed
the
door
behind
her
and
went
back
to
the
transmitter
he
looked
rather
unhappy
yes
said
a
voice
in
the
transmitter
she
just
left
commissioner
tate
said
get
on
the
beam
and
stay
there
well
trigger
said
regarding
brule
critically
i
just
meant
to
say
that
you
getting
the
least
little
bit
plump
here
and
there
under
all
that
tan
i
admit
it
does
show
yet
when
you
dressed
brule
smiled
tolerantly
in
silver
swimming
trunks
and
sandals
he
was
obviously
a
very
handsome
hunk
of
young
man
and
he
knew
it
so
did
trigger
so
did
a
quartet
of
predatory
young
females
eyeing
them
speculatively
from
a
table
only
twenty
feet
away
i
come
swimming
here
quite
a
bit
since
they
opened
the
center
he
said
he
flexed
his
right
arm
and
regarded
his
biceps
complacently
that
just
streamlined
muscle
you
looking
at
sweetheart
trigger
reached
over
and
poked
the
biceps
with
a
finger
tip
muscle
she
said
smiling
at
him
it
dents
see
he
clasped
his
other
hand
over
hers
and
squeezed
it
lightly
oh
golly
brule
she
said
happily
i
so
glad
i
back
he
gave
her
the
smile
you
not
the
only
glad
one
she
looked
around
humming
softly
they
were
having
dinner
in
one
of
the
grand
commerce
center
restaurants
this
one
happened
to
be
beneath
the
surface
of
the
artificial
swimming
lake
installed
in
the
center
a
giant
grotto
surrounded
by
chasms
of
water
on
every
side
underwater
swimmers
and
bottom
walkers
moved
past
beyond
the
wide
windows
a
streak
of
silvery
swiftness
against
a
dark
red
canyon
wall
before
her
was
trying
to
keep
away
from
a
trio
of
pursuing
spear
fishermen
even
the
lake
fish
were
hub
imports
advertised
as
such
by
the
center
her
eyes
widened
suddenly
hey
she
said
what
that
group
of
people
up
there
brule
looked
what
about
them
no
suits
you
idiot
he
grinned
oh
a
lot
of
them
do
that
okay
by
federation
law
you
know
and
seeing
manon
so
close
to
becoming
open
federation
territory
we
have
tried
to
enforce
minor
precol
regulations
much
lately
well
trigger
began
he
was
still
smiling
have
you
been
doing
it
she
inquired
suspiciously
swimming
in
the
raw
certainly
depends
on
the
company
if
you
such
a
little
prude
i
have
suggested
it
tonight
want
to
try
it
later
trigger
colored
prude
again
she
thought
nope
she
said
there
are
limits
he
patted
her
cheek
on
you
it
would
look
cute
she
shook
her
head
aware
of
a
small
fluster
of
guilt
there
had
been
considerably
less
actual
coverage
in
the
beldon
costume
than
there
was
in
the
minute
counterpart
to
brule
silver
trunks
she
wore
at
the
moment
she
have
to
tell
brule
about
the
beldon
stunt
since
it
was
more
than
likely
he
hear
about
it
from
others
nelauk
pluly
for
one
but
not
now
things
were
getting
just
a
little
delicate
along
that
line
at
the
moment
leave
us
change
the
subject
pig
she
said
cheerfully
tell
me
what
else
you
been
doing
besides
acquiring
a
gorgeous
tan
a
couple
of
hours
later
things
began
to
get
delicate
again
same
subject
trigger
had
been
somewhat
startled
at
the
spaceport
when
brule
told
her
he
had
shifted
his
living
quarters
to
a
center
apartment
and
that
a
large
number
of
precol
executives
were
taking
similar
liberties
holati
acting
commissioner
chelly
apparently
had
been
too
successful
at
keeping
up
personnel
discipline
she
had
said
anything
it
was
true
that
manon
was
still
a
precolonial
planet
only
as
a
technicality
they
did
know
quite
as
much
about
it
as
they
had
to
know
before
it
could
be
officially
released
for
unrestricted
settling
but
by
now
there
was
considerable
excuse
for
loosening
up
on
many
of
the
early
precautionary
measures
for
one
thing
there
were
just
so
many
hub
people
around
nowadays
that
it
would
have
been
a
practical
impossibility
to
enforce
all
precol
rules
what
bothered
her
mainly
about
the
business
of
brule
center
apartment
was
that
it
might
make
the
end
of
the
evening
less
pleasant
than
she
wanted
it
to
be
brule
had
become
the
least
bit
swacked
not
at
all
offensively
but
he
tended
to
get
pretty
ambitious
then
and
during
the
past
few
hours
she
noticed
that
something
had
changed
in
his
attitude
toward
her
he
always
been
confident
of
himself
when
it
came
to
women
so
it
was
that
it
was
perhaps
trigger
thought
like
an
unspoken
ultimatum
along
those
lines
and
she
felt
herself
freezing
up
a
little
in
response
to
the
thought
the
apartment
was
very
beautiful
nelauk
she
guessed
or
somebody
else
like
that
brule
taste
was
good
but
he
simply
would
have
thought
of
a
lot
of
the
details
here
neither
trigger
conceded
would
she
some
of
the
details
looked
pretty
expensive
he
came
back
into
the
living
room
in
a
dressing
gown
carrying
a
couple
of
drinks
it
was
going
to
get
awkward
all
right
like
it
he
asked
waving
a
hand
around
it
beautiful
trigger
said
honestly
she
smiled
she
sipped
at
the
drink
and
placed
it
on
the
arm
of
her
chair
somebody
like
an
interior
decorator
help
you
with
it
brule
laughed
and
sat
down
opposite
her
with
his
drink
the
laugh
had
sounded
the
least
bit
annoyed
you
right
he
said
how
did
you
guess
you
never
went
in
for
art
exactly
she
said
this
room
is
a
work
of
art
he
nodded
he
did
look
annoyed
any
more
he
looked
smug
it
is
is
it
he
said
it
did
even
cost
so
very
much
you
just
have
to
know
how
that
all
know
how
about
what
trigger
asked
know
how
to
live
brule
said
know
what
it
all
about
then
easy
he
was
looking
at
her
the
smile
was
there
the
warm
rich
voice
was
there
all
the
old
charm
was
there
it
was
brule
and
it
was
trigger
realized
she
was
twisting
her
hands
together
she
looked
down
at
them
the
little
jewel
in
the
ring
holati
tate
had
given
her
to
wear
blinked
back
with
crimson
gleamings
crimson
she
drew
a
long
slow
breath
brule
she
said
yes
said
brule
at
the
edge
of
her
vision
she
saw
the
smile
turn
eager
trigger
said
give
me
the
plasmoid
she
raised
her
eyes
and
looked
at
him
he
stopped
smiling
brule
looked
back
at
her
a
long
time
at
least
it
seemed
a
long
time
to
trigger
the
smile
suddenly
returned
what
that
supposed
to
mean
he
asked
almost
plaintively
if
a
joke
i
do
get
it
i
just
said
trigger
repeated
carefully
give
me
the
plasmoid
the
one
you
stole
brule
took
a
swallow
of
his
drink
and
put
the
glass
down
on
the
floor
are
you
feeling
well
he
asked
solicitously
give
me
the
plasmoid
honestly
trigger
he
shook
his
head
he
laughed
what
you
talking
about
a
plasmoid
the
one
you
took
the
one
you
got
here
brule
stood
up
he
studied
her
face
blinking
puzzled
then
he
laughed
richly
trigger
i
fed
you
one
drink
too
many
i
never
thought
let
me
do
it
be
sensible
now
if
i
had
a
plasmoid
here
how
could
you
tell
i
can
tell
brule
i
do
know
how
you
took
it
or
why
you
took
it
i
do
really
care
and
that
was
a
lie
trigger
thought
dismally
she
cared
just
give
it
to
me
and
i
put
it
back
we
can
talk
about
it
afterwards
afterwards
brule
said
the
laugh
came
again
but
it
sounded
a
little
hollow
he
moved
a
step
toward
her
stopped
again
hands
on
his
hips
trigger
he
said
soberly
if
i
ever
done
anything
you
approve
of
it
was
done
for
both
of
us
you
realize
that
do
you
i
think
i
do
trigger
said
warily
yes
give
it
to
me
brule
brule
leaped
forward
she
slid
sideways
out
of
the
chair
to
the
floor
as
he
leaped
she
was
crying
inside
she
realized
vaguely
brule
was
going
to
kill
her
now
if
he
could
she
caught
his
left
foot
with
both
hands
as
he
came
down
and
twisted
viciously
brule
shouted
something
his
red
furious
face
swept
by
above
he
thumped
to
the
floor
beside
her
one
leg
flung
across
her
thighs
gripping
in
colonial
school
brule
had
received
the
same
basic
training
in
unarmed
combat
that
trigger
had
he
was
close
to
eighty
pounds
heavier
than
trigger
and
it
was
still
mostly
muscle
but
it
was
nearly
four
years
now
since
he
had
bothered
himself
with
drills
and
he
had
been
put
through
mihul
advanced
students
courses
lately
he
stayed
conscious
a
little
less
than
nine
seconds
the
plasmoids
were
in
a
small
electronic
safe
built
into
a
music
cabinet
the
stamp
to
the
safe
was
in
brule
billfold
there
were
three
of
them
about
the
size
of
mice
lumps
of
translucent
hard
colorless
jelly
they
did
move
trigger
laid
them
in
a
row
on
the
polished
surface
of
a
small
table
and
blinked
at
them
for
a
moment
from
a
streaming
left
eye
the
right
eye
was
swelling
shut
brule
had
got
in
one
wild
wallop
somewhere
along
the
line
she
picked
up
a
small
jar
emptied
some
crumbly
contents
out
on
the
table
dropped
the
plasmoids
inside
closed
the
jar
and
left
the
apartment
with
it
brule
was
just
beginning
to
stir
and
groan
commissioner
tate
had
retired
yet
he
let
her
in
without
a
word
trigger
put
the
jar
down
on
a
table
three
of
your
nuts
and
bolts
in
there
she
said
he
nodded
i
know
i
thought
you
did
said
trigger
thanks
for
the
quick
cure
but
right
at
the
moment
i
do
like
you
very
much
holati
we
can
talk
about
that
in
the
morning
all
right
said
the
commissioner
he
hesitated
anything
that
should
be
taken
care
of
before
then
it
been
taken
care
of
trigger
said
one
of
our
employees
has
been
moderately
injured
i
dialed
the
medics
to
go
pick
him
up
they
have
good
night
you
might
let
me
do
something
for
that
eye
he
said
trigger
shook
her
head
i
got
stuff
in
my
quarters
she
locked
herself
into
her
quarters
got
out
a
jar
of
and
anointed
the
eye
and
a
few
other
minor
bruises
she
put
the
jar
away
made
a
mechanical
check
of
the
newly
installed
devices
dimmed
the
lights
and
climbed
into
her
bunk
for
the
next
twenty
minutes
she
wept
violently
then
she
fell
asleep
an
hour
or
so
later
she
turned
over
on
her
side
and
said
without
opening
her
eyes
come
fido
the
plasmoid
purse
appeared
just
above
the
surface
of
the
bunk
between
trigger
pillow
and
the
wall
it
dropped
with
a
small
thump
and
stood
balanced
uncertainly
trigger
slept
on
five
minutes
after
that
the
purse
opened
itself
a
little
later
again
trigger
suddenly
shifted
her
shoulder
uneasily
frowned
and
made
a
little
cry
then
her
face
smoothed
out
her
breathing
grew
quiet
and
slow
major
heslet
quillan
of
the
subspace
engineers
came
breezing
into
manon
planet
spaceport
very
early
in
the
morning
a
precol
aircar
picked
him
up
and
let
him
out
on
a
platform
of
the
headquarters
dome
near
commissioner
tate
offices
quillan
was
handed
on
toward
the
offices
through
a
string
of
underlings
and
reached
the
door
just
as
it
opened
and
trigger
argee
stepped
through
he
grasped
her
cordially
by
the
shoulders
and
cried
out
a
cheery
hello
trigger
made
a
soft
growling
sound
in
her
throat
her
left
hand
chopped
right
her
right
hand
chopped
left
quillan
grunted
and
let
go
what
the
matter
he
inquired
stepping
back
he
rubbed
one
arm
then
the
other
trigger
looked
at
him
growled
again
walked
past
him
and
disappeared
through
another
door
her
back
very
straight
come
in
quillan
commissioner
tate
said
from
within
the
office
quillan
went
in
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
what
did
i
do
he
asked
bewilderedly
nothing
much
said
holati
you
just
share
the
misfortune
of
being
a
male
human
being
at
the
moment
trigger
against
she
blew
up
the
brule
inger
setup
last
night
oh
quillan
sat
down
i
never
did
like
that
idea
much
he
said
the
commissioner
shrugged
you
do
know
the
girl
yet
if
i
hauled
inger
in
she
would
never
have
really
forgiven
me
for
it
i
had
to
let
her
handle
it
herself
actually
she
understands
that
how
did
it
go
her
cover
reported
it
was
one
hell
of
a
good
fight
for
some
seconds
if
you
looked
closer
you
might
have
just
spotted
the
traces
of
the
shiner
inger
gave
her
it
was
a
beaut
last
night
quillan
went
white
but
if
you
thinking
of
having
a
chat
with
inger
re
that
part
of
it
the
commissioner
went
on
forget
it
he
glanced
at
a
report
from
the
medical
department
on
his
desk
dislocated
shoulder
broken
thumb
moderate
concussion
and
so
on
it
was
the
throat
punch
that
finished
the
matter
he
ca
talk
yet
we
call
it
square
quillan
grunted
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
him
now
nothing
holati
said
we
know
his
contacts
why
bother
he
resign
end
of
the
month
quillan
cleared
his
throat
and
glanced
at
the
door
i
suppose
want
him
put
up
for
rehabilitation
seemed
pretty
fond
of
him
relax
son
said
the
commissioner
trigger
an
individualist
if
inger
goes
up
for
rehabilitation
it
will
be
because
he
wants
it
and
he
does
of
course
being
a
slob
suits
him
fine
he
just
likely
to
be
more
cautious
about
it
in
future
so
we
let
him
go
his
happy
way
now
let
get
down
to
business
how
does
pluly
yacht
harem
stack
up
a
reminiscent
smile
spread
slowly
over
quillan
face
he
shook
his
head
awesome
brother
he
said
plain
awesome
pick
up
anything
useful
nothing
definite
but
whenever
belchy
comes
out
of
the
esthetic
trances
he
a
worried
man
count
him
in
for
sure
yes
all
right
he
in
crack
the
aurora
yet
no
said
quillan
the
girls
are
working
on
it
but
the
ermetyne
keeps
a
mighty
taut
ship
and
a
mighty
disciplined
crew
we
have
a
couple
of
those
boys
wrapped
up
in
another
week
no
earlier
a
week
might
be
soon
enough
said
the
commissioner
it
also
might
not
i
know
it
said
quillan
but
the
aurora
does
look
a
little
bit
obvious
does
she
yes
holati
tate
admitted
just
a
little
bit
by
lunchtime
trigger
was
acting
almost
cordial
again
i
got
the
precol
job
lined
up
she
reported
to
holati
tate
i
handle
it
like
i
used
to
whenever
i
can
when
i
ca
the
kids
will
shift
in
automatically
the
kids
were
the
five
assistants
among
whom
her
duties
had
been
divided
in
her
absence
major
quillan
called
me
up
to
mantelish
lab
around
ten
she
went
on
they
wanted
to
see
repulsive
so
i
took
him
up
there
then
it
turned
out
mantelish
wanted
to
take
repulsive
along
on
a
field
trip
this
afternoon
holati
looked
startled
he
ca
do
that
and
he
knows
it
he
reached
for
the
desk
transmitter
do
bother
commissioner
i
told
mantelish
i
been
put
in
charge
of
repulsive
and
that
he
lose
an
arm
if
he
tried
to
walk
out
of
the
lab
with
him
holati
cleared
his
throat
i
see
how
did
mantelish
react
oh
he
huffed
a
bit
like
he
does
then
he
calmed
down
and
agreed
he
could
get
by
without
repulsive
out
there
so
we
stood
by
while
he
measured
and
weighed
the
thing
and
so
on
after
that
he
got
friendly
and
said
you
asked
him
to
fill
me
in
on
current
plasmoid
theory
so
i
did
said
holati
did
he
he
tried
i
think
but
it
like
you
say
i
got
lost
in
about
three
sentences
and
never
caught
up
she
looked
curiously
at
the
commissioner
i
did
have
a
chance
to
talk
to
major
quillan
alone
so
i
wondering
why
mantelish
was
told
the
in
the
vishni
area
are
hunting
for
planets
with
plasmoids
on
them
i
thought
you
felt
he
was
too
to
be
trusted
we
could
keep
that
from
him
very
well
holati
said
he
was
the
boy
who
thought
of
it
you
did
have
to
tell
him
they
found
some
possibles
did
you
he
did
unfortunately
he
had
those
plasmoid
detectors
of
his
for
about
a
month
but
he
did
happen
to
think
of
mentioning
them
the
reason
he
was
to
come
back
to
manon
originally
was
to
sort
over
the
stuff
the
fleets
have
been
sending
back
here
it
as
weird
a
collection
of
as
i
ever
seen
but
not
plasmoid
mantelish
went
into
a
temper
and
wanted
to
know
why
the
idiots
were
using
detectors
oh
lord
trigger
said
that
what
it
like
when
you
working
with
him
said
the
commissioner
we
started
making
up
detectors
wholesale
and
rushing
them
out
there
but
the
new
results
have
come
in
yet
well
that
explains
it
trigger
looked
down
at
the
desk
a
moment
then
glanced
up
and
met
the
commissioner
eye
she
colored
slightly
incidentally
she
said
i
did
take
the
opportunity
to
apologize
to
major
quillan
for
clipping
him
a
couple
this
morning
i
should
have
done
that
he
did
seem
offended
said
holati
no
not
really
she
agreed
and
i
explained
to
him
that
you
had
a
very
good
reason
to
feel
disturbed
thanks
said
trigger
by
the
way
was
he
really
a
smuggler
at
one
time
and
a
hijacker
yes
very
successful
at
it
it
excellent
cover
for
some
phases
of
intelligence
work
as
i
heard
it
though
quillan
happened
to
scramble
up
one
of
the
hub
nastier
dope
rings
in
the
process
and
was
broken
two
grades
in
rank
broken
trigger
said
why
unwarranted
interference
with
a
political
situation
the
scouts
are
rough
about
that
you
supposed
to
see
those
things
sometimes
you
do
sometimes
you
do
and
go
ahead
anyway
they
may
pat
you
on
the
back
privately
but
they
also
give
you
the
axe
i
see
she
said
she
smiled
just
how
far
did
we
get
in
bringing
you
up
to
date
yesterday
the
commissioner
asked
the
remains
that
were
doctor
azol
trigger
said
if
it
had
been
for
the
funny
business
with
trigger
holati
said
he
might
have
been
immediately
skeptical
about
doctor
azol
supposed
demise
by
plasmoid
during
a
spell
of
unconsciousness
there
had
been
no
previous
indications
that
the
screening
of
its
scientists
in
connection
with
the
plasmoid
find
might
have
been
strategically
loused
up
from
the
start
but
as
things
stood
he
did
look
on
the
event
with
very
considerable
skepticism
doctor
azol
death
in
that
particular
form
seemed
too
much
of
a
coincidence
for
beside
himself
only
azol
knew
that
another
person
already
had
suddenly
and
mysteriously
lost
consciousness
on
harvest
moon
only
azol
therefore
might
expect
that
the
commissioner
would
quietly
inform
the
official
investigators
of
the
preceding
incident
thus
cinching
the
accidental
death
theory
in
azol
case
much
more
neatly
than
the
assumed
heart
attack
had
done
the
commissioner
went
on
from
there
to
the
reflection
that
if
azol
had
chosen
to
disappear
it
might
well
have
been
with
the
intention
of
conveying
important
information
secretly
back
to
somebody
waiting
for
it
in
the
hub
he
saw
to
it
that
the
remains
were
preserved
and
that
word
of
what
could
have
happened
was
passed
on
to
a
high
federation
official
whom
he
knew
to
be
trustworthy
that
was
all
he
was
in
a
position
to
do
or
interested
in
doing
himself
security
men
presently
came
and
took
the
supposed
vestiges
of
doctor
azol
body
back
to
the
hub
it
was
until
some
months
later
when
the
works
blew
up
and
i
was
put
on
this
job
that
i
heard
any
more
about
it
holati
tate
said
it
was
azol
it
was
part
of
some
unidentifiable
cadaver
which
presumably
brought
with
him
for
just
such
a
use
anyway
they
had
gene
patterns
on
record
and
they
did
jibe
his
desk
transmitter
buzzed
and
trigger
took
it
on
an
earphone
extension
argee
she
said
she
listened
a
moment
all
right
coming
over
she
stood
up
replacing
the
earphone
office
tangle
she
explained
guess
they
feel
i
fluffing
now
i
back
i
get
back
here
as
soon
as
straightened
out
oh
by
the
way
yes
the
psychology
service
ship
messaged
in
during
the
morning
arrive
some
time
tomorrow
and
wants
a
station
assigned
to
it
outside
the
system
where
it
wo
be
likely
to
attract
attention
are
they
really
as
huge
as
all
that
i
seen
one
or
two
that
were
bigger
the
commissioner
said
but
not
much
when
they
stationed
they
send
someone
over
in
a
shuttle
to
pick
me
up
the
commissioner
nodded
i
check
on
the
arrangements
for
that
the
idea
of
the
interview
still
bothering
you
well
i
sooner
it
was
necessary
trigger
admitted
but
i
guess
it
is
she
grinned
briefly
anyway
i
be
able
to
tell
my
grandchildren
some
day
that
i
once
talked
to
one
of
the
real
egg
heads
the
psychology
service
woman
who
stood
up
from
a
couch
as
trigger
came
into
the
small
spaceport
lounge
next
evening
looked
startlingly
similar
to
major
quillan
dawn
city
assistant
gaya
standing
you
could
see
that
she
was
considerably
more
slender
than
gaya
she
had
all
of
good
looks
the
name
is
pilch
she
said
she
looked
at
trigger
and
smiled
it
was
a
good
smile
trigger
thought
not
the
professional
job
she
expected
and
everyone
who
knows
gaya
she
went
on
thinks
we
must
be
twins
trigger
laughed
are
you
just
first
cousins
the
voice
was
all
right
too
clear
and
easy
trigger
felt
herself
relax
somewhat
that
one
reason
they
picked
me
to
come
and
get
you
we
already
almost
acquainted
another
is
that
i
been
assigned
to
take
you
through
the
preliminary
work
for
your
interview
after
we
get
to
the
ship
we
can
chat
a
bit
on
the
way
and
that
should
make
it
seem
less
disagreeable
boat
in
the
speedboat
park
over
there
they
started
down
a
short
hallway
to
the
park
area
just
how
disagreeable
is
it
going
to
be
trigger
asked
not
at
all
bad
in
your
case
you
conditioned
to
the
processes
more
than
you
know
your
interviewer
will
just
pick
up
where
the
last
job
ended
and
go
on
from
there
it
when
you
have
to
work
down
through
barriers
that
you
have
a
little
trouble
trigger
was
still
mulling
that
over
as
she
stepped
ahead
of
pilch
into
the
smaller
of
two
craft
parked
side
by
side
pilch
followed
her
in
and
closed
the
lock
behind
them
the
other
one
a
combat
job
she
remarked
our
escort
commissioner
tate
made
very
sure
we
had
one
too
she
motioned
trigger
to
a
low
soft
seat
that
took
up
half
the
space
of
the
tiny
room
behind
the
lock
sat
down
beside
her
and
spoke
at
a
wall
pickup
all
set
let
ride
tinted
sky
moved
past
them
in
the
little
room
viewer
screen
then
a
tilted
landscape
flashed
by
and
dropped
back
pilch
winked
at
trigger
takes
off
like
a
scared
yazong
that
boy
he
race
the
combat
job
to
the
ship
about
those
barriers
supposing
i
told
you
something
like
this
there
no
significant
privacy
invasion
in
this
line
of
work
we
go
directly
to
the
specific
information
we
looking
for
and
deal
only
with
that
your
private
life
your
personal
thoughts
remain
secret
sacred
and
inviolate
what
would
you
say
i
say
you
a
liar
trigger
said
promptly
of
course
that
sort
of
thing
is
sometimes
told
to
nervous
interviewees
we
do
bother
with
it
but
now
supposing
i
told
you
very
sincerely
that
no
recording
will
be
made
of
any
little
personal
glimpses
we
may
get
lying
again
right
again
said
pilch
you
been
scanned
about
as
thoroughly
as
anyone
ever
gets
to
be
outside
of
a
total
therapy
your
personal
secrets
are
already
on
record
and
since
i
doing
most
of
the
preparatory
work
with
you
i
studied
all
the
ones
very
closely
you
a
pretty
good
person
for
my
money
all
right
trigger
studied
her
face
uncomfortably
hardly
all
right
but
i
guess
i
can
stand
it
she
said
as
far
as
you
concerned
anyway
she
hesitated
what
the
egghead
like
old
cranadon
said
pilch
you
wo
mind
her
a
bit
i
think
very
motherly
old
type
let
get
through
the
preparations
first
and
then
i
introduce
you
to
her
if
you
think
it
would
make
you
more
comfortable
i
just
stay
around
while
she
working
i
sat
in
on
her
interviews
before
how
that
sounds
better
trigger
said
she
did
feel
a
good
deal
relieved
they
slid
presently
into
a
lock
of
the
space
vehicle
holati
tate
had
described
as
a
flying
mountain
from
what
trigger
could
see
of
it
in
the
guide
lights
on
the
approach
it
did
rather
closely
resemble
a
very
large
mountain
of
the
craggier
sort
they
went
through
a
series
of
lifts
portals
and
passages
and
wound
up
in
a
small
and
softly
lit
room
with
a
small
desk
a
very
large
couch
a
huge
and
assorted
gadgetry
pilch
sat
down
at
the
desk
and
invited
trigger
to
make
herself
comfortable
on
the
couch
trigger
lay
down
on
the
couch
she
had
a
very
brief
sensation
of
falling
gently
through
dimness
half
an
hour
later
she
sat
up
on
the
couch
pilch
switched
on
a
desk
light
and
looked
at
her
thoughtfully
trigger
blinked
then
her
eyes
widened
first
with
surprise
then
in
comprehension
liar
she
said
said
pilch
yes
that
the
interview
true
then
you
the
egghead
tcha
said
pilch
well
i
believe
i
can
modestly
describe
myself
as
being
like
that
yes
you
another
by
the
way
we
just
smart
about
different
things
not
so
very
different
you
were
smart
about
this
trigger
said
she
swung
her
legs
off
the
couch
and
regarded
pilch
dubiously
pilch
grinned
took
most
of
the
disagreeableness
out
of
it
did
it
yes
trigger
admitted
it
did
now
what
do
we
do
now
said
pilch
i
explain
the
thing
that
had
caught
their
attention
was
a
quite
simple
process
it
just
happened
to
be
a
process
the
psychology
service
had
observed
under
those
particular
circumstances
before
here
what
our
investigators
had
the
last
time
pilch
said
lines
and
lines
of
stuff
of
course
but
here
a
simple
continuity
which
makes
it
clear
your
mother
dies
when
you
six
months
old
then
there
are
a
few
nurses
whom
you
do
like
very
much
good
nurses
but
frankly
much
too
stupid
for
you
though
you
do
know
that
and
they
either
naturally
next
you
seven
years
old
a
bit
over
and
there
a
mud
pond
on
the
farm
near
ceyce
where
you
spend
all
your
vacations
you
just
love
that
old
mud
pond
trigger
laughed
a
smelly
old
hole
actually
full
of
froggy
sorts
of
things
i
went
out
to
that
farm
six
years
ago
just
to
look
around
it
again
but
you
right
i
did
love
that
mud
pond
once
right
up
to
that
seventh
summer
pilch
said
which
was
the
summer
your
father
cousin
spent
her
vacation
on
the
farm
with
you
trigger
nodded
perhaps
i
do
remember
the
time
too
well
well
pilch
said
she
was
a
brilliant
woman
in
some
ways
she
was
about
the
age
your
mother
had
been
when
she
died
she
was
very
and
she
was
she
played
games
with
a
little
girl
sang
to
her
told
her
stories
cuddled
her
trigger
blinked
did
she
i
do
however
said
pilch
she
did
not
play
games
with
tell
stories
to
cuddle
etcetera
little
girls
who
her
voice
went
suddenly
thin
and
edged
in
all
filthy
and
smelling
from
that
dirty
slimy
old
mud
pond
trigger
looked
startled
you
know
she
said
i
do
believe
i
remember
her
saying
that
just
that
way
you
remember
it
said
pilch
now
you
never
saw
her
again
after
that
summer
your
father
had
good
sense
he
did
marry
her
as
he
apparently
intended
to
do
before
he
saw
how
she
was
going
to
be
with
you
you
went
back
to
your
old
mud
pond
just
once
more
on
your
next
vacation
she
was
there
what
had
you
done
you
waded
around
feeling
pretty
sad
and
you
stepped
on
a
sharp
stick
and
cut
your
foot
badly
sort
of
a
she
flipped
over
a
few
pages
of
some
record
on
her
desk
now
before
you
start
asking
what
interesting
about
that
i
run
over
a
few
items
age
twelve
there
that
maccadon
animal
like
a
dryland
jellyfish
a
mingo
is
it
that
swallowed
your
kitten
the
mingo
trigger
said
i
remember
that
i
killed
it
right
you
kicked
it
apart
and
pulled
out
the
kitten
but
the
kitten
was
dead
and
partly
digested
you
bawled
all
day
and
half
the
night
about
that
i
might
have
i
suppose
you
did
now
those
are
two
centering
points
there
other
stuff
connected
with
them
no
need
to
go
into
details
as
classes
stepped
now
and
then
on
things
that
squirmed
or
squashed
bad
smells
etcetera
how
do
you
feel
about
plasmoids
trigger
wrinkled
her
nose
i
just
think
they
unpleasant
things
all
except
oops
she
checked
repulsive
said
pilch
it
quite
all
right
about
repulsive
been
informed
of
that
supersecret
little
item
you
guarding
if
we
had
been
told
we
know
now
of
course
go
ahead
well
it
odd
trigger
remarked
thoughtfully
i
just
said
i
thought
plasmoids
were
rather
unpleasant
but
that
the
way
i
used
to
feel
about
them
i
do
feel
that
way
now
except
again
said
pilch
for
that
little
monstrosity
on
the
ship
if
it
was
a
plasmoid
you
rather
suspect
it
was
do
you
trigger
nodded
that
would
be
pretty
bad
very
bad
said
pilch
plasmoids
generally
you
feel
about
them
now
as
you
feel
about
potatoes
rocks
neutral
things
like
that
that
about
it
trigger
said
she
still
looked
puzzled
we
go
over
what
seems
to
have
changed
your
attitude
there
in
a
minute
or
so
here
another
thing
pilch
paused
a
moment
then
said
night
before
last
about
an
hour
after
you
gone
to
bed
you
had
a
very
light
touch
of
the
same
pattern
of
mental
blankness
you
experienced
on
that
plasmoid
station
while
i
was
asleep
trigger
said
startled
that
right
comparatively
very
light
very
brief
five
or
six
minutes
dream
activity
etcetera
smooths
out
some
blocking
on
various
sense
lines
then
normal
sleep
until
about
five
minutes
before
you
woke
up
at
that
point
there
may
have
been
another
minute
touch
of
the
same
pattern
too
brief
to
be
actually
definable
a
few
seconds
at
most
the
point
is
that
this
is
a
continuing
process
she
looked
at
trigger
a
moment
not
particularly
alarmed
are
you
no
said
trigger
it
just
seems
very
odd
she
added
i
got
rather
frightened
when
commissioner
tate
was
first
telling
me
what
had
been
going
on
yes
i
know
pilch
was
silent
for
some
moments
again
considering
the
as
if
thinking
about
something
connected
with
it
well
we
drop
that
for
now
she
said
finally
let
me
tell
you
what
been
happening
these
months
starting
with
that
first
blankout
on
harvest
moon
the
maccadon
colonial
school
has
sound
basic
psychology
courses
so
there
wo
be
much
explaining
to
do
the
connection
between
those
incidents
i
mentioned
and
your
earlier
feeling
of
disliking
plasmoids
is
obvious
is
it
trigger
nodded
good
when
you
got
the
first
service
at
commissioner
demand
there
was
very
little
to
go
on
the
amnesia
did
lift
immediately
not
very
unusual
the
blankout
might
be
interesting
because
of
the
circumstances
otherwise
the
check
showed
you
were
in
a
good
deal
better
than
normal
condition
outside
of
total
therapy
processes
and
i
believe
you
know
that
a
long
haul
there
was
much
to
be
done
for
you
and
no
particular
reason
to
do
it
so
an
process
was
initiated
and
you
were
left
alone
for
a
while
actually
something
already
was
going
on
at
the
time
but
it
spotted
until
your
next
check
what
it
amounted
to
has
been
a
relatively
minor
but
extremely
precise
and
apparently
purposeful
therapy
process
your
unconscious
memories
of
those
groupings
of
incidents
i
was
talking
about
along
with
various
linked
groupings
have
gradually
been
cleared
up
emotion
has
been
drained
away
fixed
evaluations
have
faded
associative
lines
have
shifted
now
that
nothing
remarkable
in
itself
any
good
therapist
could
have
done
the
same
for
you
and
much
more
rapidly
say
in
a
few
hours
hard
work
spread
over
several
weeks
to
permit
progressive
assimilation
without
conscious
disturbances
the
interesting
thing
is
that
this
orderly
little
process
appears
to
have
been
going
on
all
by
itself
and
that
just
does
happen
you
disturbed
now
trigger
nodded
a
little
mainly
i
wondering
why
somebody
wants
me
to
plasmoids
so
am
i
wondering
said
pilch
somebody
does
obviously
and
a
very
slick
somebody
it
is
we
find
out
by
and
by
incidentally
this
particular
part
of
the
business
has
been
concluded
apparently
somebody
does
intend
to
make
you
wild
for
plasmoids
it
enough
that
you
do
dislike
them
trigger
smiled
i
ca
see
anyone
making
me
wild
for
the
things
whatever
they
tried
pilch
nodded
could
be
done
she
said
rather
easily
you
be
bats
of
course
but
that
very
different
from
a
simple
neutralizing
process
like
the
one
we
been
discussing
now
here
something
else
you
were
pretty
unhappy
about
this
business
for
a
while
that
somebody
fault
that
was
us
i
explain
your
investigators
could
have
interfered
with
the
little
therapy
process
in
a
number
of
ways
that
would
have
taught
them
a
thing
so
they
did
but
on
your
third
check
they
found
something
else
again
it
was
in
the
least
obtrusive
in
someone
else
they
might
have
given
it
a
second
look
but
it
did
fit
at
all
with
your
major
personality
patterns
you
wanted
to
stay
where
you
were
stay
where
i
was
in
the
manon
system
oh
trigger
flushed
a
little
well
i
know
let
go
on
a
moment
we
had
this
inharmonious
inclination
so
we
told
commissioner
tate
to
bring
you
to
the
hub
and
keep
you
there
to
see
what
would
happen
and
on
maccadon
in
just
a
few
weeks
you
begun
working
that
moderate
inclination
to
be
back
in
the
manon
system
up
to
a
dandy
compulsion
trigger
licked
her
lips
i
sure
said
pilch
you
had
to
have
a
good
sensible
reason
you
gave
yourself
one
well
oh
you
were
fond
of
that
young
man
all
right
who
would
be
lug
i
go
for
him
myself
till
i
got
him
on
that
couch
that
is
but
that
was
the
first
time
you
had
been
able
to
stand
a
couple
of
months
away
from
him
it
was
also
the
first
time
started
worrying
about
competition
you
now
had
your
justification
and
we
pilch
said
darkly
had
a
fine
solid
compulsion
with
no
doubt
very
revealing
ramifications
to
it
to
work
on
just
one
thing
went
wrong
with
that
trigger
you
do
have
the
compulsion
any
more
oh
you
do
even
said
pilch
have
the
original
moderate
inclination
now
one
might
have
some
suspicions
there
but
we
let
them
ride
for
the
moment
she
did
something
on
the
desk
the
huge
suddenly
lit
up
a
soft
plane
of
blankness
with
a
suggestion
of
receding
depths
within
it
last
night
shortly
before
you
woke
up
pilch
said
you
had
a
dream
actually
you
had
a
series
of
eight
dreams
during
the
night
which
seem
pertinent
here
but
the
earlier
ones
were
rather
vague
preliminary
structures
in
one
way
and
another
their
content
is
included
in
this
final
symbol
grouping
let
see
what
we
can
make
of
them
a
shape
appeared
on
the
screen
trigger
started
then
laughed
what
do
you
think
of
it
pilch
asked
a
little
green
man
she
said
well
it
could
be
a
sort
of
counterpart
to
the
little
yellow
thing
on
the
ship
could
it
the
good
little
dwarf
and
the
very
bad
little
dwarf
could
be
said
pilch
how
do
you
feel
about
the
notion
good
plasmoids
and
bad
plasmoids
trigger
shook
her
head
no
it
does
feel
right
what
else
feels
right
pilch
asked
the
farmer
the
little
old
man
who
owned
the
farm
where
the
mud
pond
was
liked
him
did
you
very
much
he
knew
a
lot
of
fascinating
things
she
laughed
again
you
know
i
hate
to
have
him
find
out
but
that
little
green
man
also
reminds
me
quite
a
bit
of
commissioner
tate
i
do
think
he
mind
hearing
it
pilch
said
she
paused
a
moment
all
right
what
this
a
second
shape
appeared
a
sort
of
caricature
of
a
wild
mean
horse
trigger
said
she
added
thoughtfully
there
was
a
horse
like
that
on
that
farm
too
i
suppose
you
know
that
yes
any
thoughts
about
it
well
one
the
little
farmer
was
the
only
one
who
could
handle
that
horse
it
was
mutated
horse
actually
one
of
the
life
bank
deals
that
did
work
out
so
well
enormously
strong
it
could
work
hours
at
a
stretch
without
even
noticing
it
but
it
was
just
a
plain
mean
animal
observed
pilch
was
the
dream
feeling
about
it
trigger
nodded
i
remember
i
used
to
think
it
was
crazy
for
that
horse
to
want
to
go
around
kicking
and
biting
things
to
pieces
which
was
about
all
it
really
wanted
to
do
i
imagine
it
was
crazy
at
that
you
were
ever
in
any
danger
from
it
yourself
were
you
trigger
laughed
i
could
have
got
anywhere
near
it
you
should
have
seen
the
kind
of
place
the
old
farmer
kept
it
when
it
was
working
i
did
said
pilch
long
wide
pit
in
the
ground
cover
for
shade
plenty
of
food
running
water
he
was
a
good
farmer
very
high
locked
fence
around
it
to
keep
little
girls
and
anyone
else
from
getting
too
close
to
his
useful
monster
right
said
trigger
she
shook
her
head
when
you
people
look
into
somebody
mind
you
look
we
work
at
it
pilch
said
let
see
what
you
can
do
with
this
one
trigger
was
silent
for
almost
a
minute
before
she
said
in
a
subdued
voice
i
just
get
what
it
shows
it
does
seem
to
mean
anything
what
does
it
show
laughing
giants
stamping
on
a
farm
a
tiny
sort
of
farm
it
looks
like
it
might
be
the
little
green
man
farm
no
wait
it
not
his
but
it
belongs
to
other
little
green
people
how
do
you
feel
about
that
well
i
hate
those
giants
trigger
said
they
cruel
and
they
laugh
about
being
cruel
are
you
afraid
of
them
trigger
blinked
at
the
screen
for
a
few
seconds
no
she
said
in
a
low
sleepy
voice
not
yet
pilch
was
silent
a
moment
she
said
then
one
more
trigger
looked
and
frowned
presently
she
said
i
have
a
feeling
that
does
mean
something
but
all
i
get
is
that
it
the
faces
of
two
clocks
on
one
of
them
the
hands
are
going
around
very
fast
and
on
the
other
they
go
around
slowly
yes
pilch
said
she
waited
a
little
no
other
thought
about
those
clocks
just
that
they
should
mean
something
trigger
shook
her
head
that
all
pilch
hand
moved
on
the
desk
again
the
went
blank
and
the
light
in
the
little
room
brightened
slowly
pilch
face
was
reflective
that
will
have
to
do
for
now
she
said
trigger
this
ship
is
working
on
an
urgent
job
somewhere
else
we
have
to
go
back
and
finish
that
job
but
i
be
able
to
return
to
manon
in
about
ten
days
and
then
we
have
another
session
and
i
think
that
will
get
this
little
mystery
cleared
up
all
of
it
all
of
it
i
say
the
whole
pattern
seems
to
be
moving
into
view
more
details
will
show
up
in
the
interval
and
one
more
cautious
boost
then
should
bring
it
out
in
full
trigger
nodded
that
good
news
i
been
getting
a
little
fed
up
with
being
a
kind
of
walking
enigma
do
blame
you
at
all
pilch
said
sounding
almost
exactly
like
commissioner
tate
incidentally
you
a
busy
lady
at
present
but
if
you
do
have
half
an
hour
to
spare
from
time
to
time
you
might
just
sit
down
comfortably
somewhere
and
listen
to
yourself
thinking
the
way
things
are
going
that
should
bring
quite
a
bit
of
information
to
view
trigger
looked
doubtful
listen
to
myself
thinking
you
find
yourself
getting
the
knack
of
it
rather
quickly
pilch
said
she
smiled
just
head
off
in
that
general
direction
whenever
you
find
the
time
and
do
work
too
hard
at
it
are
there
any
questions
now
before
we
start
back
to
manon
trigger
studied
her
a
moment
there
one
thing
i
like
to
be
sure
about
she
said
but
i
suppose
you
people
have
your
problems
with
security
too
who
does
said
pilch
you
secure
enough
for
me
fire
away
all
right
trigger
said
commissioner
tate
told
me
people
like
you
do
work
much
with
individuals
not
as
much
as
we
like
to
that
true
so
you
would
have
been
working
with
me
if
whatever
has
been
going
on
were
somehow
connected
with
the
plasmoids
oh
yes
i
would
said
pilch
or
old
cranadon
someone
like
that
we
do
give
service
as
required
when
somebody
has
the
good
sense
to
ask
for
it
but
obviously
we
could
have
dropped
that
other
job
just
now
and
come
to
manon
to
clear
up
some
individual
difficulty
so
i
am
involved
with
the
plasmoid
mess
you
right
in
the
middle
of
it
trigger
that
definite
in
just
what
way
is
something
we
should
be
able
to
determine
next
session
pilch
turned
off
the
desk
light
and
stood
up
i
always
hate
to
run
off
and
leave
something
half
finished
like
this
she
admitted
but
have
to
run
anyway
the
plasmoids
are
nowhere
near
the
head
of
the
federation
problem
list
at
present
they
just
coming
up
mighty
fast
when
trigger
reached
her
office
next
morning
she
learned
that
the
psychology
service
ship
had
moved
out
of
the
manon
area
within
an
hour
after
she
been
returned
to
the
headquarters
dome
the
night
before
none
of
the
members
of
the
plasmoid
team
were
around
the
commissioner
who
had
a
poor
opinion
of
sleep
had
been
up
for
the
past
three
hours
he
left
word
trigger
could
reach
him
if
necessary
in
the
larger
of
his
two
ships
parked
next
to
the
dome
in
precol
port
presumably
he
had
the
ship
sealed
up
and
was
sitting
in
the
transmitter
cabinet
swapping
messages
with
the
in
the
vishni
area
he
was
likely
to
be
at
that
for
hours
more
professor
mantelish
had
yet
got
back
from
his
latest
field
trip
and
major
heslet
quillan
just
was
there
it
looked
trigger
decided
not
at
all
reluctantly
like
a
good
day
to
lean
into
her
precol
job
a
bit
she
told
the
staff
to
pitch
everything
not
utterly
routine
her
way
and
leaned
a
set
of
vitally
important
reports
from
precol
giant
planet
survey
squad
had
been
mislaid
somewhere
around
headquarters
during
conferences
she
soothed
down
the
g
p
squad
and
instituted
a
check
search
a
team
of
hub
ecologists
who
had
decided
for
themselves
that
outworld
booster
shots
were
required
on
manon
called
in
nervously
from
a
polar
station
to
report
that
their
hair
was
falling
out
trigger
tapped
the
manon
fever
button
on
her
desk
and
suggested
toupees
the
ecologists
were
displeased
a
medical
emergency
zoomed
out
of
the
dome
to
go
to
their
rescue
and
trigger
gave
it
its
directions
while
dialing
for
the
medical
checker
who
allowed
the
visitors
to
avoid
their
shots
she
had
a
brief
chat
with
the
young
man
and
left
him
twitching
as
the
g
p
squad
came
back
on
to
inquire
whether
the
reports
had
been
found
yet
trigger
began
to
get
a
comfortable
feeling
of
being
back
in
the
good
old
groove
then
a
message
from
the
medical
department
popped
out
on
her
desk
it
was
addressed
to
commissioner
tate
and
stated
that
brule
inger
was
now
able
to
speak
again
trigger
frowned
sighed
bit
her
lip
and
thought
a
moment
she
dialed
for
doctor
leehaven
got
your
message
she
said
how
he
doing
all
right
the
old
medic
said
has
he
said
anything
no
he
scared
if
he
could
get
up
the
courage
he
ask
for
a
personnel
lawyer
yes
i
imagine
tell
him
this
then
from
the
commissioner
not
from
me
there
be
no
charges
but
precol
expects
his
resignation
end
of
the
month
that
on
the
level
doctor
leehaven
demanded
incredulously
of
course
the
doctor
snorted
you
people
are
getting
but
i
tell
him
the
morning
went
on
trigger
was
suspiciously
studying
a
traffic
control
note
stating
that
a
devagas
missionary
ship
had
checked
in
and
berthed
at
the
spaceport
when
the
g
c
center
management
called
in
to
report
with
some
nervousness
that
the
center
much
advertised
roof
had
just
flipped
several
dozen
tons
of
falling
moon
belt
material
into
the
spaceport
area
most
of
it
unfortunately
had
dropped
around
and
upon
a
devagas
missionary
ship
not
damaged
is
it
she
asked
the
center
said
no
but
the
missionary
captain
insisted
on
speaking
to
the
person
in
charge
here
to
whom
should
they
refer
him
refer
him
to
me
trigger
said
expectantly
she
switched
on
the
vision
screen
the
missionary
captain
was
a
tall
man
in
uniform
after
confirming
to
his
satisfaction
that
trigger
was
indeed
in
charge
he
informed
her
in
chilled
tones
that
the
devagas
union
would
hold
her
personally
responsible
for
the
unprovoked
outrage
unless
an
apology
was
promptly
forthcoming
trigger
apologized
promptly
he
acknowledged
with
a
curt
nod
the
ship
will
now
require
new
spacepaint
he
pointed
out
unmollified
trigger
nodded
we
send
a
work
squad
out
immediately
we
the
missionary
captain
said
shall
supervise
the
work
only
the
best
grade
of
paint
will
be
acceptable
the
very
best
only
trigger
agreed
he
gave
her
another
curt
nod
and
switched
off
ass
she
said
she
cut
in
the
barrier
and
dialed
holati
ship
it
took
a
while
to
get
through
he
was
probably
busy
somewhere
in
the
crate
like
belchik
pluly
the
commissioner
while
still
a
very
wealthy
man
would
have
been
a
very
much
wealthier
one
if
it
were
for
his
hobby
in
his
case
the
hobby
was
ships
of
which
he
now
owned
two
what
made
them
expensive
was
that
they
had
been
to
the
commissioner
specifications
and
his
specifications
had
provided
him
with
two
rather
exact
duplicates
of
the
two
types
of
scout
fighting
ships
in
which
squadron
commander
tate
had
made
space
hideous
for
evildoers
in
the
good
old
days
nobody
as
yet
had
got
up
the
nerve
to
point
out
to
him
that
private
battlecraft
definitely
were
not
allowable
in
the
manon
system
he
came
on
finally
trigger
told
him
about
the
devagas
did
you
know
those
characters
were
in
the
area
she
asked
the
commissioner
knew
they
stopped
in
at
the
system
check
station
three
days
before
the
ship
was
clean
their
missionaries
all
go
armed
of
course
but
that
their
privilege
by
treaty
they
been
browsing
around
and
going
hither
and
yon
in
skiffs
the
ship
been
in
orbit
till
this
morning
think
they
here
in
connection
with
whatever
balmordan
is
up
to
trigger
inquired
we
take
that
for
granted
balmordan
by
the
way
attended
a
big
shindig
on
the
pluly
yacht
yesterday
unless
his
tail
goofed
he
still
up
there
apparently
staying
on
as
a
guest
are
you
having
these
other
devagas
watched
not
individually
too
many
of
them
and
they
scattered
all
over
the
place
mantelish
got
back
he
checked
in
an
hour
ago
you
mean
he
upstairs
in
his
quarters
now
she
asked
right
he
had
a
few
more
crates
hauled
into
the
lab
and
he
locked
himself
in
with
them
and
the
place
may
have
got
something
important
and
may
just
be
going
through
one
of
his
secrecy
periods
again
we
find
out
by
and
by
oh
and
here
a
social
note
the
first
lady
of
tranest
is
shopping
in
the
grand
commerce
center
this
morning
well
that
should
boost
business
said
trigger
are
you
going
to
be
back
in
the
dome
by
lunchtime
i
think
so
might
have
some
interesting
news
too
incidentally
fine
she
said
see
you
then
twenty
minutes
later
the
desk
transmitter
gave
her
the
to
be
shielded
signal
up
went
the
barrier
again
major
quillan
face
looked
out
at
her
from
the
screen
he
was
trigger
saw
in
mantelish
lab
mantelish
stood
at
a
work
bench
behind
him
hi
he
said
hi
yourself
when
did
you
get
in
just
now
could
you
pick
up
the
and
bring
it
up
here
right
now
if
you
can
quillan
said
the
professor
got
something
new
he
thinks
i
on
my
way
said
trigger
take
about
five
minutes
she
hurried
down
to
her
quarters
summoned
repulsive
container
into
the
room
and
slung
the
strap
over
her
shoulder
then
she
stood
still
a
moment
frowning
slightly
something
something
like
a
wisp
of
memory
something
she
be
remembering
was
stirring
in
the
back
of
her
mind
then
it
was
gone
trigger
shook
her
head
it
would
keep
she
opened
the
door
and
stepped
out
into
the
hall
she
fell
down
as
she
fell
she
tried
to
give
the
bag
the
squeeze
but
she
could
move
her
fingers
she
could
move
anything
there
were
people
around
her
they
were
doing
things
swiftly
she
was
turned
over
on
her
back
and
for
a
few
moments
then
she
saw
her
own
face
smiling
down
at
her
from
just
a
few
feet
away
she
was
suddenly
in
a
large
room
well
lit
with
elaborate
furnishings
sitting
leaned
back
in
a
soft
chair
before
a
highly
polished
little
table
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
two
people
sat
looking
at
her
with
expressions
of
mild
surprise
one
of
them
was
lyad
ermetyne
the
other
was
a
man
she
did
know
the
man
glanced
aside
at
lyad
very
fast
he
said
he
looked
again
at
trigger
he
was
a
small
man
with
hair
a
deeply
lined
face
beautiful
eyes
very
lyad
said
we
must
remember
that
hello
trigger
hello
trigger
said
her
glance
went
once
around
the
room
and
came
back
to
lyad
amiably
observant
face
repulsive
container
was
nowhere
around
there
seemed
to
be
nobody
else
in
the
room
an
ornamental
comweb
stood
against
one
wall
two
of
the
walls
were
covered
with
heavy
hangings
and
a
great
canopy
bellied
from
the
ceiling
no
doors
or
portals
in
sight
they
might
be
camouflaged
or
behind
those
hangings
any
number
of
people
could
be
in
call
range
and
a
few
certainly
must
be
watching
her
right
now
because
that
small
man
was
no
type
the
small
man
was
regarding
her
with
something
like
restrained
amusement
a
cool
one
he
murmured
very
cool
trigger
looked
at
him
a
moment
then
turned
her
eyes
back
to
lyad
she
did
feel
cool
she
felt
tense
and
scared
cold
this
was
probably
very
bad
what
did
you
want
to
see
me
about
she
asked
lyad
smiled
a
business
matter
do
you
know
where
you
are
not
on
your
ship
first
lady
the
eyes
barely
narrowed
but
lyad
had
become
at
that
moment
very
alert
why
do
you
think
so
she
asked
pleasantly
this
room
said
trigger
you
do
gush
i
think
what
was
the
business
matter
in
a
moment
lyad
said
she
smiled
again
where
else
might
you
be
trigger
thought
she
could
guess
but
she
did
intend
to
not
out
loud
she
shrugged
it
no
place
i
want
to
be
she
settled
back
a
little
in
her
chair
her
right
hand
brushed
the
porgee
pouch
the
porgee
pouch
it
would
have
been
like
the
ermetyne
to
investigate
the
pouch
carefully
take
out
the
gun
and
put
the
pouch
back
but
they
might
not
have
somebody
was
bound
to
be
watching
she
could
find
out
not
until
the
instant
after
she
decided
to
try
the
denton
i
can
believe
that
lyad
said
forgive
me
the
discourtesy
of
so
urgent
an
invitation
trigger
a
quite
recent
event
made
it
seem
necessary
as
to
the
business
as
a
start
this
gentleman
is
doctor
veetonia
he
is
an
investigator
of
extraordinary
talents
along
his
line
at
the
moment
he
is
a
trifle
tired
because
of
the
very
long
hours
he
worked
last
night
doctor
veetonia
turned
his
head
to
look
at
her
i
did
first
lady
well
that
does
explain
this
odd
weariness
did
i
work
well
splendidly
lyad
assured
him
you
were
never
better
doctor
he
nodded
smiled
vaguely
and
looked
back
at
trigger
this
must
go
too
i
suppose
i
afraid
it
must
lyad
said
a
great
pity
doctor
veetonia
said
a
great
pity
it
would
have
been
a
pleasant
memory
this
very
cool
one
the
vague
smile
shifted
in
the
lined
face
again
you
are
so
beautiful
child
he
told
trigger
in
your
anger
and
terror
and
despair
and
above
it
still
the
gauging
purpose
the
strong
quick
thinking
you
will
not
give
in
easily
oh
no
not
easily
at
all
first
lady
doctor
veetonia
said
plaintively
i
should
like
to
remember
this
one
it
should
be
possible
i
think
small
icy
fingers
were
working
up
and
down
trigger
spine
the
ermetyne
gave
her
a
light
wink
i
afraid
it
is
doctor
she
said
there
are
such
very
important
matters
to
be
discussed
besides
trigger
argee
and
i
will
come
to
an
amicable
agreement
very
quickly
no
doctor
veetonia
face
had
turned
very
sullen
no
said
lyad
she
will
agree
to
nothing
any
fool
can
see
that
i
recommend
then
a
simple
chemical
approach
your
creatures
can
handle
it
drain
her
throw
her
away
i
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter
oh
but
doctor
the
ermetyne
protested
that
would
be
so
crude
and
so
very
uncertain
why
we
might
be
here
for
hours
still
he
shook
his
head
lyad
smiled
she
stroked
the
lined
cheek
with
light
finger
tips
have
you
forgotten
the
palace
at
hamal
lake
she
asked
the
great
library
the
laboratories
have
i
been
very
generous
doctor
veetonia
turned
his
face
toward
her
he
smiled
thoughtfully
now
that
is
true
he
admitted
for
the
moment
i
did
forget
he
looked
back
at
trigger
the
first
lady
gives
he
told
her
and
the
first
lady
takes
away
she
has
given
me
wealth
and
much
leisure
she
takes
from
me
now
and
then
a
memory
very
skillfully
since
she
was
my
pupil
but
still
the
mind
must
be
dim
by
a
little
each
time
it
is
done
his
face
suddenly
grew
concerned
he
looked
at
lyad
again
two
more
years
only
he
said
in
two
years
i
shall
be
free
to
retire
lyad
lyad
nodded
that
was
our
bargain
doctor
you
know
i
keep
bargains
doctor
veetonia
said
yes
you
do
it
is
strange
in
an
ermetyne
very
well
i
shall
do
it
he
looked
at
trigger
face
the
eyes
blinked
once
or
twice
she
is
almost
certain
she
is
being
watched
he
said
but
she
has
been
thinking
of
using
the
comweb
the
child
i
believe
is
prepared
to
attack
us
at
any
opportune
moment
he
smiled
show
her
first
why
her
position
is
hopeless
then
we
shall
see
why
it
not
in
the
least
hopeless
lyad
said
and
please
feel
no
concern
about
the
doctor
trigger
his
methods
are
quite
painless
and
involve
none
of
the
indignities
of
a
chemical
investigation
if
you
are
at
all
reasonable
we
just
sit
here
and
talk
for
twenty
minutes
or
so
then
you
will
tell
me
what
sum
you
wish
to
have
deposited
for
you
in
what
bank
and
you
will
be
free
to
go
what
will
we
talk
about
trigger
said
well
for
one
said
the
ermetyne
there
is
that
rather
handsome
little
purse
you
been
carrying
about
lately
my
technicians
inform
me
there
may
be
some
risk
of
damaging
its
contents
if
they
attempt
to
force
it
open
we
do
want
that
so
we
talk
a
bit
about
the
proper
way
of
opening
it
she
gave
trigger
her
little
smile
and
doctor
veetonia
will
verify
the
accuracy
of
any
statements
made
on
the
matter
she
considered
oh
and
then
i
shall
ask
a
few
questions
not
many
and
you
will
answer
them
it
really
will
be
quite
simple
but
now
let
me
tell
you
why
i
so
very
much
wanted
to
see
you
today
we
had
a
guest
here
last
night
a
gentleman
whom
you
met
balmordan
he
was
on
some
quite
important
subjects
and
so
though
the
doctor
and
i
were
very
patient
and
careful
he
died
in
the
end
but
before
he
died
he
had
told
me
as
much
as
i
really
needed
to
know
from
him
now
with
that
information
she
went
on
and
with
the
contents
of
your
purse
and
with
another
little
piece
of
information
which
you
possess
i
shall
presently
go
away
on
orado
a
few
hours
later
ambassador
will
have
a
quiet
talk
with
some
members
of
the
federation
council
and
that
will
be
all
really
she
smiled
no
dramatic
pursuit
no
hue
and
cry
a
few
treaties
will
be
considerably
revised
and
the
whole
hubbub
about
the
plasmoids
will
be
over
she
nodded
because
they
can
be
made
to
work
you
know
and
very
well
doctor
veetonia
had
looked
away
from
trigger
while
lyad
was
speaking
he
said
now
my
congratulations
first
lady
but
the
girl
has
not
been
convinced
in
the
least
that
she
should
cooperate
she
may
hope
to
be
rescued
before
the
information
you
want
can
be
forced
from
her
the
ermetyne
sighed
oh
really
now
trigger
she
very
nearly
pouted
well
if
i
must
explain
about
that
to
you
too
i
shall
she
considered
a
moment
did
you
see
your
facsimile
trigger
nodded
very
briefly
lyad
smiled
how
she
and
my
other
people
passed
in
and
out
of
that
dome
and
how
it
happened
that
your
room
guards
were
found
unconscious
and
were
very
hurriedly
taken
to
the
medical
department
contagious
ward
makes
an
amusing
little
story
but
it
would
be
too
long
in
the
telling
just
now
your
facsimile
is
one
of
tranest
finest
actresses
she
been
studying
and
practicing
being
you
for
months
she
knows
where
to
go
and
what
to
do
in
that
dome
to
avoid
contact
with
people
who
know
you
too
intimately
if
it
seems
that
discovery
is
imminent
she
needs
only
a
minute
by
herself
to
turn
into
an
entirely
different
personality
so
hours
might
pass
without
anyone
even
suspecting
you
were
gone
but
on
the
other
hand
lyad
admitted
fairly
your
double
might
be
caught
immediately
or
within
minutes
she
would
not
be
conscious
then
and
i
doubt
your
fierce
little
commissioner
would
go
to
the
unethical
limits
of
a
live
woman
if
he
did
of
course
he
would
learn
nothing
from
her
let
assume
nevertheless
that
for
one
reason
and
another
your
friends
suspect
me
immediately
and
only
me
at
the
time
you
were
being
taken
from
the
dome
i
was
observed
leaving
the
grand
commerce
center
i
shopped
rather
freely
a
number
of
fairly
large
crates
and
so
forth
were
loaded
into
my
speedboat
and
we
were
observed
returning
to
the
aurora
not
bad
trigger
admitted
another
facsimile
i
suppose
of
course
the
ermetyne
glanced
at
a
small
jeweled
wrist
watch
now
the
aurora
if
my
orders
were
being
followed
and
they
were
dived
approximately
five
minutes
ago
unless
somebody
who
might
be
your
wrathful
rescuers
approached
her
before
that
time
in
which
case
she
dived
then
in
either
case
the
dive
was
seen
by
the
watchers
and
the
proper
conclusions
sooner
or
later
will
be
drawn
from
that
supposing
they
dive
after
her
and
run
her
down
trigger
said
they
might
the
aurora
is
not
an
easy
ship
to
run
down
in
subspace
but
they
might
after
some
hours
it
would
be
of
no
consequence
at
all
would
it
the
amber
eyes
regarded
trigger
with
very
little
expression
for
a
moment
how
many
hours
or
minutes
do
you
think
you
could
hold
out
here
trigger
argee
if
it
became
necessary
to
put
on
real
pressure
i
do
know
trigger
admitted
she
moistened
her
lips
i
could
give
you
a
rather
close
estimate
i
think
the
ermetyne
said
but
forgive
me
for
bringing
up
that
matter
it
was
an
unnecessary
discourtesy
let
assume
instead
that
the
rather
clever
people
with
whom
you
been
working
are
quite
clever
enough
to
see
through
all
these
little
maneuverings
let
assume
further
that
they
are
even
able
to
conclude
immediately
where
you
and
i
must
be
at
the
moment
we
are
as
it
happens
on
the
griffin
which
is
belchik
pluly
outsize
yacht
and
which
is
orbiting
manon
at
present
this
room
is
on
a
sealed
level
of
the
yacht
where
belchik
private
life
normally
goes
on
undisturbed
i
persuaded
him
two
days
ago
to
clear
out
this
section
of
it
for
my
own
use
there
is
only
one
portal
entry
to
the
level
and
that
entry
is
locked
and
heavily
guarded
at
the
moment
there
are
two
portal
exits
one
of
them
opens
into
a
special
lock
in
which
there
is
a
small
speedboat
of
mine
prepared
to
leave
it
a
very
fast
boat
if
there
have
been
faster
ones
built
in
the
hub
i
have
heard
of
them
yet
and
it
can
dive
directly
from
the
lock
she
smiled
at
trigger
you
have
the
picture
now
have
you
if
your
friends
decide
to
board
the
griffin
they
be
able
to
do
it
without
too
much
argument
after
all
we
do
want
to
be
blown
up
accidentally
but
they
have
quite
a
time
working
their
way
into
this
level
if
a
boarding
party
is
reported
we
just
all
quietly
go
away
together
with
no
fuss
or
hurry
i
guarantee
that
no
one
is
going
to
trace
or
overtake
that
boat
you
see
yes
trigger
said
disconsolately
slumping
back
a
little
her
right
hand
dropped
to
her
lap
well
she
thought
last
chance
doctor
veetonia
frowned
first
he
began
trigger
slapped
the
porgee
pouch
and
the
denton
soundless
blast
slammed
the
talented
investigator
back
and
over
in
his
chair
gun
trigger
explained
unnecessarily
the
ermetyne
face
had
turned
white
with
shock
she
flicked
a
glance
down
at
the
man
then
looked
back
at
trigger
there
guns
on
me
too
i
imagine
trigger
said
but
this
one
goes
off
very
easily
first
lady
it
would
take
hardly
any
jolt
at
all
lyad
nodded
slightly
they
no
fools
they
wo
risk
shooting
worry
her
voice
was
careful
but
quite
even
a
tough
cookie
as
the
commissioner
had
remarked
we
wo
bother
about
them
at
the
moment
trigger
said
let
stand
up
together
they
stood
up
we
stay
about
five
feet
apart
trigger
went
on
i
do
know
if
you
the
type
the
ermetyne
almost
smiled
i
not
she
said
no
point
in
taking
chances
trigger
said
five
feet
she
gave
doctor
veetonia
a
quick
glance
he
did
look
very
unpleasantly
dead
we
go
over
to
that
comweb
in
a
moment
she
told
lyad
i
imagine
you
would
have
left
it
on
open
circuit
lyad
shook
her
head
calls
go
through
the
ship
communication
office
your
own
people
on
duty
there
no
pluly
will
they
take
your
orders
certainly
can
they
listen
in
trigger
asked
not
if
we
seal
the
set
here
trigger
nodded
you
do
the
talking
she
said
i
give
you
commissioner
tate
personal
number
tell
them
to
dial
it
the
precol
transmitters
pick
up
comweb
circuits
switch
on
the
screen
after
the
call
is
in
he
want
to
see
me
when
he
comes
on
just
tell
him
happened
where
we
are
what
the
layout
is
he
to
come
over
with
a
squad
to
get
us
i
wo
say
much
if
anything
i
just
keep
the
gun
on
you
if
there
any
fumble
we
both
get
it
there
wo
be
any
fumble
trigger
lyad
said
all
right
let
set
up
the
rest
of
it
before
we
move
after
the
commissioner
signs
off
he
be
up
here
in
three
minutes
flat
or
less
how
about
this
ship
officers
do
they
take
your
orders
too
with
the
obvious
exception
of
yourself
lyad
said
everyone
on
the
griffin
takes
my
orders
at
the
moment
then
just
tell
whoever
in
charge
of
the
yacht
to
let
the
squad
in
before
there
any
shooting
the
commissioner
can
get
awfully
then
get
the
guards
away
from
that
entry
portal
for
their
own
good
the
ermetyne
nodded
will
do
all
right
that
covers
it
i
think
they
looked
at
each
other
for
a
moment
with
the
information
you
got
from
balmordan
trigger
remarked
you
should
still
be
able
to
make
a
very
good
dicker
with
the
council
first
lady
i
understand
they
very
eager
to
get
the
plasmoid
mess
straightened
out
quietly
lyad
lifted
one
shoulder
in
a
brief
shrug
perhaps
she
said
let
move
said
trigger
they
walked
toward
the
comweb
rather
edgily
not
very
fast
not
very
slow
trigger
four
or
five
steps
behind
there
had
been
no
sound
from
the
walls
and
no
other
sign
of
what
must
be
very
considerable
excitement
nearby
trigger
spine
kept
tingling
a
needlebeam
and
a
good
marksman
could
pluck
away
the
denton
and
her
hand
along
with
it
without
much
real
risk
to
ermetyne
but
probably
even
the
smallest
of
risks
was
more
than
the
tranest
people
would
be
willing
to
take
when
the
first
person
was
involved
lyad
reached
the
comweb
and
stopped
trigger
stopped
too
five
feet
away
go
ahead
she
said
quietly
lyad
turned
to
face
her
let
me
make
one
last
well
call
it
an
appeal
she
said
do
be
an
overethical
fool
trigger
argee
the
arrangement
i
planned
will
do
no
harm
to
anybody
come
in
with
me
and
you
can
write
your
own
ticket
for
the
rest
of
your
life
no
ticket
trigger
said
she
waggled
the
denton
slightly
go
ahead
you
can
talk
to
the
council
later
lyad
shrugged
resignedly
turned
again
and
reached
toward
the
comweb
trigger
might
have
relaxed
just
a
trifle
at
that
moment
or
perhaps
there
was
some
other
cue
that
pilli
could
pick
up
there
came
no
sound
from
the
ceiling
canopy
what
she
caught
was
a
sense
of
something
moving
above
her
then
the
great
golden
bulk
landed
with
a
terrifying
lightness
on
the
thick
carpet
between
lyad
and
herself
the
eyeless
nightmare
head
was
three
feet
from
her
own
the
lights
in
the
room
went
out
trigger
flung
herself
backwards
rolled
six
feet
to
one
side
stood
up
backed
away
and
stopped
again
the
blackness
in
the
room
was
complete
she
spun
the
denton
to
kill
there
was
silence
around
her
and
then
a
soft
rustling
at
some
distance
it
might
have
been
the
cautious
shuffle
of
a
heavy
foot
over
thick
carpeting
it
stopped
again
where
was
lyad
her
eyes
shifted
about
trying
to
pierce
the
darkness
she
thought
she
said
lyad
yes
lyad
voice
came
easily
in
the
dark
she
might
be
standing
about
thirty
feet
away
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
call
your
animal
off
trigger
said
quietly
i
do
want
to
kill
it
she
began
moving
in
the
direction
from
which
lyad
had
spoken
pilli
wo
hurt
you
trigger
the
ermetyne
said
he
been
sent
in
to
disarm
you
that
all
throw
your
gun
away
and
he
wo
even
touch
you
she
laughed
do
bother
shooting
in
my
direction
either
not
in
the
room
any
more
trigger
stopped
not
because
of
what
that
hateful
laughing
voice
had
said
but
because
in
the
dark
about
her
a
fresh
pungent
smell
was
growing
the
smell
of
ripe
apples
she
moistened
her
lips
she
whispered
pilli
keep
away
eyeless
the
dark
would
mean
nothing
to
it
seconds
later
she
heard
the
thing
breathing
she
faced
the
sound
it
stopped
for
a
moment
then
it
came
again
a
slow
animal
breathing
it
seemed
to
circle
slowly
to
her
left
after
a
little
it
stopped
then
it
was
coming
toward
her
she
said
softly
almost
pleadingly
pilli
stop
go
back
pilli
silence
pilli
odor
lay
heavily
all
around
trigger
heard
her
blood
drumming
in
her
ears
and
for
a
second
then
she
imagined
she
could
feel
like
a
tangible
fog
the
body
warmth
of
the
monster
standing
in
the
dark
before
her
it
was
imagination
something
like
a
smooth
heavy
pad
of
rubber
closed
around
her
right
wrist
and
tightened
terribly
the
denton
went
off
two
three
four
times
before
she
was
jerked
violently
sideways
flung
away
sent
stumbling
backward
against
some
low
piece
of
furniture
and
sprawling
over
it
the
gun
was
lost
as
she
scrambled
dizzily
to
her
feet
pilli
screamed
it
was
a
thin
high
breathless
sound
like
the
screaming
of
a
terrified
human
child
it
stopped
abruptly
and
as
if
that
had
been
a
signal
the
room
came
full
of
light
again
trigger
blinked
dazedly
against
the
light
virod
stood
before
her
looking
at
her
a
pair
of
opaque
yellow
goggles
shoved
up
on
his
forehead
glasses
the
thing
lay
in
a
great
shapeless
huddle
on
the
floor
twenty
feet
to
one
side
she
could
see
her
gun
but
virod
held
one
pointing
at
her
virod
other
hand
moved
suddenly
its
palm
caught
the
side
of
her
face
in
a
hefty
slap
trigger
staggered
dumbly
sideways
got
her
balance
and
stood
facing
him
again
she
did
even
feel
anger
her
cheek
began
to
burn
stop
amusing
yourself
virod
it
was
lyad
voice
trigger
saw
her
then
standing
in
a
small
door
across
the
room
where
a
wall
hanging
had
been
folded
away
she
appeared
to
be
in
shock
first
lady
virod
explained
blandly
is
pilli
dead
yes
i
have
her
gun
he
got
it
from
her
virod
slapped
a
pocket
of
his
jacket
and
some
part
of
trigger
mind
noted
the
gesture
and
suddenly
came
awake
so
i
saw
well
too
bad
about
pilli
but
it
was
necessary
bring
her
here
then
and
be
reasonably
gentle
lyad
still
sounded
unruffled
and
put
that
gun
in
a
different
pocket
fool
or
she
take
it
away
from
you
she
looked
at
trigger
impersonally
as
virod
brought
her
to
the
little
door
his
left
hand
clamped
on
her
arm
just
above
the
elbow
she
said
too
bad
you
killed
my
expert
trigger
we
have
to
use
a
chemical
approach
now
flam
and
virod
are
quite
good
at
that
but
there
will
be
some
pain
not
too
much
because
i
be
watching
them
but
it
will
be
rather
undignified
i
afraid
and
it
will
take
a
great
deal
longer
tanned
tall
sinuous
flam
stood
in
the
small
room
beyond
the
door
trigger
saw
a
long
low
table
clamps
and
glittering
gadgetry
that
would
have
been
where
balmordan
had
been
able
to
make
it
against
his
finally
there
was
still
one
thing
she
could
do
the
yacht
was
orbiting
that
sort
of
thing
wo
be
at
all
necessary
she
said
shakily
her
voice
shook
with
great
ease
as
if
it
had
been
practicing
it
all
along
no
lyad
said
you
won
trigger
said
resignedly
i
play
along
now
i
show
you
how
to
open
that
handbag
to
start
with
lyad
nodded
how
do
you
open
it
you
have
to
press
it
in
the
right
places
have
them
bring
it
here
show
you
lyad
laughed
you
a
little
too
eager
and
much
too
docile
trigger
considering
what
in
that
handbag
it
not
at
all
likely
it
will
detonate
if
we
brightly
hand
it
to
you
and
let
you
start
pressing
but
something
or
other
of
a
very
undesirable
nature
would
certainly
happen
flam
the
tall
redhead
nodded
and
smiled
she
went
over
to
a
wall
cabinet
unlocked
it
and
took
out
repulsive
container
lyad
said
put
it
on
that
shelf
for
the
moment
then
bring
me
gun
and
hers
i
afraid
you
have
to
go
up
on
that
table
now
trigger
she
said
if
you
really
decided
to
cooperate
it
wo
be
too
bad
and
by
and
by
you
start
telling
us
very
exactly
what
should
be
done
with
that
handbag
and
a
few
other
things
she
might
have
caught
trigger
expression
then
she
added
drily
i
was
informed
a
few
nights
ago
that
you
quite
an
artist
in
tactics
so
are
virod
and
flam
so
if
you
want
to
give
virod
an
opportunity
to
amuse
himself
a
little
go
right
ahead
at
that
point
the
graceful
thing
undoubtedly
would
have
been
to
just
smile
and
get
up
on
the
table
trigger
discovered
she
could
do
it
she
gave
them
a
fast
silent
vicious
tussle
mouth
clenched
breathing
hard
through
her
nose
it
was
quite
insanely
useless
they
letting
her
get
anywhere
near
lyad
after
virod
had
amused
himself
a
little
he
picked
her
up
and
plunked
her
down
on
the
table
a
minute
later
she
was
stretched
out
on
it
face
down
wrists
and
ankles
secured
with
padded
clamps
to
its
surface
flam
took
a
small
knife
and
neatly
slit
the
back
of
the
precol
uniform
open
along
the
line
of
her
spine
she
folded
the
cloth
away
then
trigger
felt
the
thin
icy
touches
of
some
spray
walk
up
her
ending
at
the
base
of
her
skull
it
was
so
very
painful
lyad
had
told
the
truth
about
that
but
presently
it
became
extremely
undignified
then
her
thoughts
were
speeding
up
and
slowing
down
and
swirling
around
in
an
odd
confusing
fashion
and
at
last
her
voice
began
to
say
things
she
did
want
it
to
say
after
this
there
might
have
been
a
pause
she
seemed
to
be
floating
up
out
of
a
small
pool
of
sleep
when
lyad
voice
said
somewhere
with
cold
fury
in
it
there
inside
a
whole
little
series
of
popped
up
suddenly
then
like
a
chain
of
firecrackers
somebody
had
set
off
they
formed
themselves
into
a
pattern
and
there
the
pattern
was
in
trigger
mind
she
looked
at
it
her
eyes
flew
open
in
surprise
she
began
to
laugh
weakly
light
footsteps
came
quickly
over
to
her
where
is
that
plasmoid
trigger
the
ermetyne
was
in
a
fine
towering
rage
she
better
say
something
ask
the
commissioner
she
said
mumbling
a
little
it
wearing
off
first
lady
said
flam
shall
i
trigger
thoughts
went
eddying
away
for
a
moment
and
she
did
hear
lyad
reply
but
then
the
vanilla
smell
was
there
again
and
the
thin
icy
touches
this
time
they
stopped
abruptly
halfway
and
then
there
was
a
very
odd
stillness
all
around
trigger
as
if
everybody
and
everything
had
stopped
moving
together
a
deep
savage
voice
said
i
hope
there
be
no
trouble
folks
i
just
want
her
a
lot
worse
than
you
do
trigger
frowned
in
puzzlement
next
came
an
angry
roar
some
thumping
sounds
a
sudden
crack
oops
the
deep
voice
said
happily
a
little
too
hard
i
afraid
why
of
course
trigger
thought
she
opened
her
eyes
and
twisted
her
head
around
still
awake
trigger
quillan
asked
from
the
door
of
the
room
he
looked
pleasantly
surprised
there
was
a
very
large
bellmouthed
gun
in
his
hand
that
was
an
little
group
in
the
doorway
trigger
felt
on
his
knees
before
quillan
was
a
fat
elderly
man
blinking
dazedly
at
her
he
wore
a
brilliantly
purple
bath
towel
knotted
about
his
loins
and
nothing
else
it
was
a
moment
before
she
recognized
belchik
pluly
old
belchy
and
on
the
floor
before
belchy
motionless
as
if
in
devout
prostration
virod
lay
on
his
face
dead
no
doubt
he
should
have
got
gay
with
quillan
yes
trigger
said
then
remembering
quillan
question
i
got
a
very
fast
but
they
fed
me
a
fresh
load
of
dope
just
a
moment
ago
so
i
saw
said
quillan
his
glance
shifted
beyond
trigger
lyad
he
said
almost
gently
yes
quillan
lyad
voice
came
from
the
other
side
of
trigger
trigger
turned
her
head
toward
it
lyad
and
flam
both
stood
at
the
far
side
of
the
room
their
expressions
were
unhappy
i
do
like
at
all
quillan
said
what
been
going
on
here
not
one
bit
which
is
why
big
boy
got
the
neck
broken
finally

the
rest

left
them
that
way
for
a
moment
there
was
motion
near
her
and
the
wrist
clamps
came
off
in
turn
lyad
moved
down
to
her
feet

gun

quillan

feet

announced
she
saw
them
again
then
on
the
shelf
walked
over
and
picked
up
the
plasmoid
container
she
looked
inside
snapped
it
shut
and
slung
the
strap
over
her
shoulder
she
picked
up
the
denton
looked
at
its
setting
spun
it
and
turned
first
lady
she
said
lyad
went
white
around
the
lips
quillan
made
some
kind
of
startled
sound
trigger
shot
flam
ran
at
her
then
screaming
arms
waving
eyes
wild
and
green
like
an
animal
trigger
half
turned
and
shot
again
she
looked
at
quillan
just
stunned
she
explained
she
waited
quillan
let
his
breath
out
slowly
glad
to
hear
it
he
glanced
down
at
pluly
purse
was
open
he
remarked
significantly
trigger
agreed
how
the
doohinkus
she
laughed
safe
and
sound
believe
me
good
he
said
he
still
looked
somewhat
puzzled
put
the
eye
on
belchy
for
a
few
seconds
then
we
taking
lyad
along
i
have
to
carry
her
now
right
trigger
said
she
felt
rather
jaunty
at
the
moment
she
put
the
eye
on
belchik
belchik
moaned
they
started
out
of
the
little
room
pluly
in
the
van
clutching
his
towel
the
ermetyne
dangling
loosely
over
quillan
left
shoulder
looked
fairly
gruesomely
dead
you
walk
this
side
of
me
trigger
quillan
said
still
all
right
she
nodded
yes
actually
she
was
quite
it
was
mainly
a
problem
with
her
thoughts
which
showed
a
tendency
to
move
along
in
odd
little
leaps
and
bounds
with
short
stops
in
between
as
if
something
were
trying
to
freeze
them
up
but
if
it
was
going
to
be
like
the
first
time
she
should
last
till
they
got
to
wherever
they
were
going
halfway
across
the
room
she
saw
the
golden
thing
like
a
huge
furry
sack
on
the
carpet
and
shivered
poor
pilli
she
said
alas
quillan
said
politely
i
gather
you
did
just
stun
pilli
she
shook
her
head
could
she
said
too
big
too
fast
how
about
the
other
one
oh
him
stunned
he
an
investigator
they
thought
he
was
dead
though
that
what
scared
lyad
and
flam
yeah
quillan
said
thoughtfully
it
would
another
section
of
wall
hanging
had
folded
aside
and
a
wide
door
stood
open
behind
it
they
went
through
the
door
and
turned
into
a
mirrored
passageway
pluly
still
tottering
rapidly
ahead
might
keep
that
gun
ready
trigger
quillan
warned
we
just
could
get
jumped
here
think
so
though
they
have
to
get
past
the
commissioner
oh
he
here
too
she
did
hear
what
quillan
answered
because
things
faded
out
around
then
when
they
faded
in
again
the
passageway
with
the
mirrors
had
disappeared
and
they
were
coming
to
the
top
of
a
short
flight
of
low
wide
stairs
and
into
a
very
beautiful
room
this
room
was
high
and
long
not
very
wide
in
the
center
was
a
small
square
swimming
pool
and
against
the
walls
on
either
side
was
a
long
row
of
tall
square
crystal
pillars
through
which
strange
lights
undulated
slowly
trigger
glanced
curiously
at
the
nearest
pillar
she
stopped
short
galaxy
she
said
startled
quillan
reached
back
and
grabbed
her
arm
with
his
gun
hand
keep
moving
girl
that
just
how
belchik
keeps
his
harem
grouped
around
him
when
he
working
not
too
bad
an
idea
it
does
cut
down
the
chatter
this
is
his
office
office
then
she
saw
the
large
business
desk
with
prosaic
standard
equipment
which
stood
on
the
carpet
on
the
other
side
of
the
pool
they
moved
rapidly
past
the
pool
quillan
still
hauling
at
her
arm
trigger
kept
staring
at
the
pillars
they
passed
supple
and
languid
they
floated
in
their
crystal
cages
in
tinted
shifting
lights
eyes
closed
hair
drifting
about
their
faces
awesome
is
it
quillan
voice
said
yes
said
trigger
awesome
one
in
each
he
is
a
pig
they
look
drowned
he
is
and
they
are
said
quillan
very
lively
girls
when
he
lets
them
out
now
around
this
turn
and
oops
pluly
had
reached
the
turn
at
the
end
of
the
row
of
pillars
moaned
again
and
fallen
forwards
fainted
quillan
said
well
we
do
need
him
any
more
watch
your
step
trigger
dead
one
just
behind
pluly
trigger
stretched
her
stride
and
cleared
the
dead
one
behind
pluly
neatly
there
were
three
more
dead
ones
lying
inside
the
entrance
to
the
next
big
room
she
went
past
them
feeling
rather
dreamy
the
sight
of
a
squat
black
subtub
parked
squarely
on
the
thick
purple
carpeting
ahead
of
her
with
its
canopy
up
did
strike
her
as
unusual
then
she
saw
that
the
man
leaning
against
the
canopy
a
gun
in
one
hand
was
commissioner
tate
she
smiled
she
waved
her
hand
at
him
as
they
came
up
hi
holati
hi
yourself
said
the
commissioner
he
asked
quillan
how
she
doing
not
bad
quillan
said
a
bit
at
the
moment
double
dose
of
ceridim
by
the
smell
of
it
had
a
little
trouble
here
i
see
a
little
the
commissioner
acknowledged
they
went
for
their
guns
very
uninformed
gentlemen
said
quillan
he
let
lyad
limp
form
slide
off
his
shoulder
and
bent
forward
to
lower
her
into
the
subtub
back
seat
trigger
had
been
waiting
for
a
chance
to
get
into
the
conversation
just
who
she
demanded
now
frowning
is
a
bit
at
the
moment
you
said
quillan
you
doped
remember
you
ride
up
front
with
the
commissioner
here
he
picked
her
up
plasmoid
purse
and
all
and
set
her
down
on
the
front
seat
holati
tate
she
discovered
then
was
already
inside
quillan
swung
down
into
the
seat
behind
her
the
canopy
snapped
shut
above
the
commissioner
shifted
the
tub
controls
in
the
screens
the
room
outside
vanished
a
darkness
went
rushing
downwards
past
them
a
thought
suddenly
popped
to
mind
again
and
trigger
burst
into
tears
the
commissioner
glanced
over
at
her
what
the
matter
trigger
girl
i
so
i
killed
pilli
he
then
her
mind
froze
up
with
a
jolt
and
thinking
stopped
completely
quillan
reached
over
the
back
of
the
seat
and
eased
her
over
on
her
side
got
to
her
finally
he
said
he
sat
down
again
he
brooded
a
moment
she
should
get
so
disturbed
about
that
pilli
thing
he
remarked
then
it
could
have
lived
anyway
eh
the
commissioner
said
absently
watching
the
screens
why
not
its
brains
quillan
explained
were
too
far
apart
the
commissioner
blinked
it
getting
to
you
too
son
he
said
trigger
came
out
of
the
ceridim
trance
hours
before
lyad
awoke
from
the
stunner
blast
she
absorbed
the
commissioner
was
sitting
in
a
chair
beside
her
bunk
napping
she
looked
around
a
moment
feeling
very
comfortable
and
secure
this
was
her
personal
cabin
on
commissioner
tate
ship
the
one
he
referred
to
as
the
big
job
modeled
after
the
patrol
ships
of
the
space
scouts
it
was
actually
very
big
but
six
or
seven
people
could
go
traveling
around
in
it
very
comfortably
at
the
moment
it
appeared
to
be
howling
through
subspace
at
its
hellish
rate
again
going
somewhere
well
that
could
keep
trigger
reached
out
and
poked
the
commissioner
knee
hey
holati
she
whispered
wake
up
his
eyes
opened
he
looked
at
her
and
smiled
back
again
eh
he
said
trigger
motioned
at
the
door
close
it
she
whispered
got
something
to
tell
you
talk
away
he
said
quillan
piloting
the
first
lady
out
cold
and
mantelish
got
and
i
doped
him
nobody
else
on
board
trigger
lay
back
and
looked
at
him
this
is
going
to
sound
pretty
odd
she
warned
him
then
she
told
him
what
repulsive
had
done
and
what
he
was
trying
to
do
the
commissioner
looked
badly
shaken
you
sure
of
that
trigger
sure
i
sure
trying
to
talk
to
you
that
it
he
blinked
at
her
i
looked
in
the
bag
and
the
thing
was
gone
lyad
knows
it
was
gone
trigger
said
so
in
case
she
gets
a
chance
to
blab
to
someone
we
say
you
had
it
he
nodded
and
stood
up
you
stay
here
he
said
prescription
for
the
kind
of
treatment
you
had
is
a
day
of
bed
rest
where
are
you
going
i
going
to
go
talk
to
that
psychology
ship
he
said
and
just
let
try
to
stall
me
this
time
he
went
off
up
the
passage
toward
the
transmitter
cabinet
in
the
forward
part
of
the
ship
some
minutes
passed
then
trigger
suddenly
heard
commissioner
tate
voice
raised
in
great
wrath
she
listened
it
appeared
the
psychology
service
had
got
off
on
the
wrong
foot
by
advising
him
once
more
to
stay
calm
he
came
back
presently
and
sat
down
beside
the
bunk
still
a
little
red
in
the
face
they
going
to
follow
us
he
said
if
they
had
i
would
have
turned
back
and
gunned
our
way
on
board
that
lopsided
disgrace
of
theirs
follow
us
where
he
grunted
a
place
called
luscious
we
be
there
in
under
a
week
it
take
them
about
three
but
they
starting
immediately
trigger
blinked
looks
like
the
plasmoids
have
made
it
to
the
head
of
the
problem
list
i
would
be
surprised
said
the
commissioner
i
was
put
through
to
that
pilch
after
a
while
she
said
to
remind
you
to
listen
to
your
thinking
whenever
you
can
get
around
to
it
know
what
she
meant
i
not
sure
i
do
trigger
said
hesitantly
but
she
mentioned
it
i
give
it
a
whirl
why
are
we
going
to
luscious
selan
fleet
found
plasmoids
on
it
it
in
the
vishni
area
what
kind
of
plasmoids
he
shrugged
they
do
amount
to
much
from
what
i
heard
small
stuff
but
definitely
plasmoid
it
looks
like
somebody
might
have
done
some
experimenting
there
for
a
while
and
not
long
ago
did
they
find
the
big
one
not
yet
no
trace
of
any
people
on
luscious
either
he
chewed
his
lip
thoughtfully
for
a
moment
about
an
hour
after
we
picked
you
and
lyad
up
he
said
we
had
a
council
order
transmitted
to
the
ship
told
us
to
swing
off
course
a
bit
and
rendezvous
with
a
fast
courier
boat
of
theirs
what
for
the
order
said
the
courier
was
to
take
lyad
on
board
and
head
for
the
hub
with
her
some
diplomatic
business
he
scratched
his
chin
it
also
instructed
us
to
treat
the
first
lady
of
tranest
with
the
courtesy
due
to
her
station
meanwhile
brother
trigger
said
outraged
just
too
bad
i
could
read
that
message
said
holati
tate
some
gravitic
disturbance
rendezvous
point
hours
behind
us
they
never
catch
up
said
trigger
but
that
being
pretty
insubordinate
holati
it
was
till
just
now
he
said
i
mentioned
that
we
had
lyad
on
board
to
that
pilch
person
she
said
she
speak
to
the
council
we
to
hang
on
to
lyad
and
when
pilch
gets
to
luscious
she
interview
her
trigger
grinned
now
that
she
remarked
gives
me
a
feeling
of
great
satisfaction
somehow
when
pilch
gets
her
little
mitts
on
someone
there
is
much
left
out
i
had
that
impression
meanwhile
we
put
the
ermetyne
through
a
routine
questioning
ourselves
when
she
gets
over
being
groggy
courtesy
will
be
on
the
moderate
side
she
probably
spill
part
of
what
she
knows
especially
if
you
sit
there
and
hand
her
the
beady
stare
from
time
to
time
that
trigger
assured
him
will
be
hardly
an
effort
at
all
i
can
imagine
you
pretty
sure
that
thing
will
show
up
again
trigger
nodded
just
leave
the
handbag
with
me
all
right
he
stood
up
i
got
a
hot
lunch
prepared
for
you
bring
the
bag
along
then
you
can
tell
me
what
happened
after
they
grabbed
you
how
did
you
find
out
i
was
gone
trigger
asked
your
fac
he
said
the
girl
was
darn
good
actually
i
talked
to
you
her
on
office
transmitter
once
and
did
spot
a
sour
note
mostly
she
just
kept
out
of
everybody
way
very
slick
at
it
we
would
have
got
her
fairly
fast
because
we
were
preparing
for
to
luscious
by
then
but
she
spilled
it
herself
how
i
located
her
finally
again
on
transmitter
screen
there
was
no
one
on
her
side
to
impress
she
took
a
sniff
of
porgee
trigger
laughed
delightedly
good
old
porgee
pouch
it
beat
them
twice
but
how
did
you
know
where
i
was
no
problem
there
we
knew
lyad
had
strings
on
pluly
quillan
knew
about
that
sealed
level
on
pluly
yacht
and
got
pluly
to
invite
him
over
to
admire
the
harem
right
after
the
dawn
city
arrived
while
he
was
admiring
he
was
also
recording
floor
patterns
for
a
subtub
jump
that
gimmick
pretty
much
of
a
spilled
secret
now
but
on
a
swap
for
you
and
lyad
it
was
worth
it
we
came
aboard
five
minutes
after
we
nabbed
your
fac
the
ermetyne
figured
you
go
chasing
after
the
aurora
trigger
said
well
the
commissioner
said
tolerantly
the
ermetyne
pretty
young
the
aurora
was
a
bit
obvious
how
come
quillan
did
start
wondering
when
i
did
show
up
in
mantelish
lab
with
repulsive
so
that
what
he
was
for
holati
said
he
rubbed
the
side
of
his
jaw
i
was
curious
about
that
angle
that
was
quillan
that
was
fac
in
mantelish
lab
trigger
said
startled
sure
that
how
they
all
got
in
in
those
specimen
crates
mantelish
has
been
lugging
into
the
dome
the
past
couple
of
days
it
looks
like
the
prof
been
hypnotized
up
to
his
ears
for
months
the
last
five
hours
of
her
day
of
recuperative
rest
trigger
spent
asleep
her
cabin
door
locked
and
the
plasmoid
purse
open
on
the
bunk
beside
her
holati
had
come
by
just
before
to
report
that
the
ermetyne
was
now
awake
but
very
groggy
apparently
more
than
a
little
shocked
and
not
yet
quite
able
to
believe
she
was
still
alive
he
dose
her
with
this
and
that
and
interrogations
would
be
postponed
until
everybody
was
on
their
feet
when
trigger
woke
up
from
her
five
hour
nap
the
purse
was
shut
she
opened
it
and
looked
inside
repulsive
was
down
there
quietly
curled
up
smart
little
bugger
are
you
she
said
not
entirely
with
approval
then
she
reached
in
and
gave
him
a
pat
she
locked
the
purse
got
dressed
and
went
up
to
the
front
of
the
ship
carrying
repulsive
along
all
four
of
the
others
were
up
in
the
lounge
area
which
included
the
partitioned
control
section
the
partition
had
been
slid
into
the
wall
and
the
commissioner
who
was
at
the
controls
at
the
moment
had
swung
his
seat
half
around
toward
the
lounge
he
glanced
at
the
plasmoid
purse
as
trigger
came
in
grinned
and
gave
her
a
small
wink
come
in
and
sit
down
he
said
we
been
waiting
for
you
trigger
sat
down
and
looked
at
them
something
apparently
had
been
going
on
quillan
tanned
face
was
thoughtful
perhaps
a
trifle
amused
mantelish
looked
very
red
and
angry
his
shock
of
white
hair
was
wildly
rumpled
the
ermetyne
appeared
a
bit
wilted
what
been
going
on
trigger
asked
it
was
the
wrong
question
mantelish
took
a
deep
breath
and
began
bellowing
like
a
wounded
trigger
listened
with
some
admiration
it
was
one
of
the
best
jobs
of
huffing
heard
even
from
the
professor
he
ran
down
in
less
than
five
minutes
though
apparently
he
already
let
off
considerable
steam
lyad
had
dehypnotized
him
at
the
commissioner
suggestion
it
had
been
a
lengthy
job
requiring
a
couple
of
hours
but
it
was
a
complete
one
which
was
understandable
since
it
was
the
first
lady
herself
trigger
gathered
gradually
from
the
noise
who
had
put
mantelish
under
the
influence
back
in
his
own
garden
on
maccadon
and
within
two
weeks
after
his
first
return
from
harvest
moon
it
was
again
lyad
who
had
given
mantelish
his
call
to
bemused
duty
via
a
transmitted
verbal
cue
on
her
arrival
in
manon
and
instructed
him
to
get
lost
from
his
league
guards
for
a
few
hours
in
manon
swamps
there
she
had
met
and
conferred
with
him
and
pumped
him
of
all
he
could
tell
her
as
the
final
outrage
she
had
instructed
him
to
lug
her
crated
cohorts
preserved
like
pluly
harem
ladies
into
the
precol
dome
to
care
for
them
tenderly
there
and
at
the
proper
cued
moment
to
release
them
for
action
all
under
the
illusion
that
they
were
priceless
biological
specimens
mantelish
was
in
the
least
appeased
by
the
fact
that
again
at
the
commissioner
suggestion
lyad
had
installed
one
minor
new
which
she
said
would
clear
up
permanently
his
tendency
toward
attacks
of
dive
sickness
but
he
just
ran
down
finally
and
sat
there
glowering
at
the
ermetyne
now
and
then
well
the
commissioner
remarked
this
might
be
as
good
a
time
as
any
to
ask
a
few
questions
got
your
little
quizzer
with
you
quillan
quillan
nodded
lyad
looked
at
both
of
them
in
turn
and
then
briefly
and
for
the
first
time
glanced
in
trigger
direction
it
was
exactly
an
appealing
glance
it
might
have
been
a
questioning
one
and
trigger
discovered
suddenly
that
she
felt
just
a
little
sympathy
for
lyad
lyad
had
lost
out
on
a
very
big
gamble
and
each
in
his
own
way
there
were
three
very
formidable
males
among
whom
she
was
sitting
none
of
them
was
friendly
two
were
oversized
and
the
undersized
one
had
a
fairly
bloodchilling
record
for
anyone
on
the
wrong
side
of
law
and
order
trigger
decided
to
forget
about
beady
stares
for
the
moment
cheer
up
lyad
she
said
nobody
going
to
hurt
you
just
give
the
answers
she
got
another
glance
not
a
grateful
one
exactly
not
an
ungrateful
one
either
temporary
support
had
been
acknowledged
commissioner
tate
has
informed
me
the
ermetyne
said
that
this
group
does
not
recognize
the
principle
of
diplomatic
immunity
in
my
case
under
the
circumstances
i
must
accept
that
and
so
i
shall
answer
any
questions
i
can
she
looked
at
the
pocket
quizzer
quillan
was
checking
over
unhurriedly
but
such
verification
instruments
are
of
no
use
in
questioning
me
why
not
quillan
asked
idly
i
been
conditioned
against
them
of
course
lyad
said
i
an
ermetyne
of
tranest
by
the
time
i
was
twelve
years
old
that
toy
of
yours
could
have
registered
a
reaction
from
me
that
i
did
want
it
to
show
quillan
slipped
the
toy
back
in
his
pocket
true
enough
first
lady
he
said
and
that
one
small
strike
in
your
favor
we
thought
you
might
try
to
gimmick
the
gadget
now
we
just
pitch
you
some
questions
a
recorder
on
do
stall
on
the
answers
and
he
and
the
commissioner
started
flipping
out
questions
the
ermetyne
flipped
back
the
answers
so
far
as
trigger
could
tell
there
was
any
stalling
or
any
time
for
it
azol
doctor
azol
had
been
her
boy
from
the
start
he
was
now
on
tranest
the
main
item
in
his
report
to
her
had
been
the
significance
of
the
plasmoid
unit
he
also
reported
that
trigger
argee
had
become
unconscious
on
harvest
moon
they
considered
the
possibility
that
somebody
was
controlling
trigger
argee
or
attempting
to
control
her
because
of
her
connections
with
the
plasmoid
operations
gess
fayle
lyad
had
been
looking
for
doctor
fayle
as
earnestly
as
everyone
else
after
his
disappearance
she
had
not
been
able
to
buy
him
so
far
as
she
knew
nobody
had
been
able
to
buy
him
doctor
fayle
had
appeared
to
intend
to
work
for
himself
he
was
at
present
well
outside
the
hub
area
of
space
he
still
had
with
him
yes
she
could
become
more
specific
about
the
location
with
the
help
of
star
maps
let
get
them
out
said
commissioner
tate
they
got
them
out
the
ermetyne
presently
circled
a
largish
section
of
the
vishni
fleet
area
the
questions
began
again
professor
mantelish
had
told
her
of
his
experiments
with
this
plasmoid
there
was
an
interruption
here
while
mantelish
huffed
reflexively
but
it
was
very
brief
the
professor
wanted
to
learn
more
about
the
first
lady
depravities
himself
and
its
various
possible
associations
with
the
main
unit
but
by
the
time
this
information
became
available
to
her
had
been
placed
under
heavy
guard
professor
mantelish
had
made
one
attempt
to
smuggle
it
out
to
her
but
had
been
unable
to
walk
past
the
guards
with
it
tranest
agents
had
made
several
unsuccessful
attempts
to
pick
up
the
plasmoid
she
knew
that
another
group
had
made
similarly
unsuccessful
attempts
the
devagas
she
did
not
yet
know
the
specific
nature
of
importance
but
it
was
important
trigger
trigger
argee
might
be
able
to
tell
them
why
trigger
was
important
doctor
fayle
certainly
could
so
could
the
top
ranks
of
the
devagas
hierarchy
lyad
at
the
moment
could
not
she
did
know
that
trigger
argee
importance
was
associated
directly
with
that
of
plasmoid
this
information
had
been
obtained
from
a
devagas
operator
now
dead
not
balmordan
the
operator
had
been
in
charge
of
the
attempted
pickup
on
evalee
the
much
more
elaborate
affair
at
the
colonial
school
had
been
a
tranest
job
a
devagas
group
had
made
attempts
to
interfere
with
it
but
had
been
disposed
of
pluly
lyad
had
strings
on
belchik
he
was
afraid
of
the
devagas
but
somewhat
more
terrified
of
her
his
fear
of
the
devagas
was
due
to
the
fact
that
he
and
an
associate
had
provided
the
hierarchy
with
a
very
large
quantity
of
contraband
materials
the
nature
of
the
materials
indicated
the
devagas
were
constructing
a
major
fortified
outpost
on
a
world
either
airless
or
with
poisonous
atmosphere
pluly
associate
had
since
been
murdered
pluly
believed
he
was
next
in
line
to
be
silenced
balmordan
balmordan
had
been
a
rather
devagas
intelligence
agent
lyad
had
heard
of
him
only
recently
he
had
been
in
charge
of
the
attempts
to
obtain
lyad
had
convinced
him
that
she
would
make
a
very
dangerous
competitor
in
the
manon
area
she
also
had
made
information
regarding
her
activities
there
available
to
him
so
balmordan
and
a
select
group
of
his
gunmen
had
attended
pluly
party
on
pluly
yacht
they
had
been
allowed
to
force
their
way
into
the
sealed
level
and
were
there
caught
in
a
trap
the
gunmen
had
been
killed
balmordan
had
been
questioned
the
questioning
revealed
that
the
devagas
had
found
doctor
fayle
and
the
unit
almost
immediately
after
fayle
disappearance
they
had
succeeded
in
creating
some
working
plasmoids
to
go
into
satisfactory
operation
they
still
needed
balmordan
had
not
known
why
but
they
no
longer
needed
trigger
argee
trigger
argee
was
now
to
be
destroyed
at
the
earliest
opportunity
again
balmordan
had
not
known
why
fayle
and
his
unit
were
in
the
fortress
dome
the
devagas
had
been
building
it
was
in
the
area
lyad
had
indicated
it
was
supposed
to
be
very
thoroughly
concealed
balmordan
might
or
might
not
have
known
its
exact
coordinates
his
investigators
made
the
inevitable
slip
finally
and
triggered
a
violent
reaction
balmordan
had
died
him
had
produced
no
further
relevant
information
the
little
drumfire
of
questions
ended
abruptly
trigger
glanced
at
her
watch
it
had
been
going
on
for
only
fifteen
minutes
but
she
felt
somewhat
dizzy
by
now
the
ermetyne
just
looked
a
little
more
wilted
after
a
minute
commissioner
tate
inquired
politely
whether
there
was
any
further
information
the
first
lady
could
think
of
to
give
them
at
this
time
she
shook
her
head
no
only
professor
mantelish
believed
her
but
the
interrogation
was
over
apparently
quillan
took
over
the
ship
controls
and
the
commissioner
and
trigger
went
with
the
recorder
into
the
little
office
back
of
the
transmitter
cabinet
to
slam
out
some
fast
reports
to
the
hub
and
other
points
lyad
was
apologizing
profoundly
to
mantelish
as
they
left
the
lounge
the
professor
was
huffing
back
at
her
rather
mildly
a
little
while
later
lyad
showing
indications
of
restrained
surprise
was
helping
trigger
prepare
dinner
they
took
it
into
the
lounge
quillan
remained
at
the
controls
while
the
others
started
eating
trigger
fixed
up
a
tray
and
brought
it
to
him
thanks
for
the
rescue
major
she
said
he
grinned
up
at
her
it
was
a
pleasure
trigger
glanced
back
at
the
little
group
in
the
lounge
think
she
was
fibbing
a
bit
sure
mainly
she
decided
in
advance
how
much
to
tell
and
how
much
not
she
thinks
fast
in
action
though
no
slips
what
she
told
of
what
she
knows
makes
a
solid
story
and
with
angles
we
can
check
on
fast
so
it
bound
to
have
plenty
of
information
in
it
it
do
for
the
moment
she
already
started
buttering
up
mantelish
said
trigger
she
do
that
quillan
said
by
the
time
we
reach
luscious
the
prof
probably
might
as
well
be
back
in
the
trances
the
commissioner
intends
to
give
her
a
little
rope
i
think
how
close
is
luscious
to
that
area
she
showed
quillan
flicked
on
their
course
screen
and
superimposed
the
map
lyad
had
marked
red
dot
well
inside
he
pointed
out
that
bit
was
probably
quite
solid
info
he
looked
up
at
her
did
it
bother
you
much
to
hear
the
devagas
have
dropped
the
grab
idea
and
are
out
to
do
you
in
trigger
shook
her
head
not
really
she
said
would
make
much
difference
one
way
or
the
other
would
it
very
little
he
patted
her
hand
well
they
not
going
to
get
you
doll
one
way
the
other
trigger
smiled
i
believe
you
she
said
thanks
she
looked
back
into
the
lounge
again
just
at
present
she
did
have
a
feeling
of
relaxed
unconcerned
security
it
probably
was
going
to
last
though
she
glanced
at
quillan
those
computers
of
yours
she
said
what
did
they
have
to
say
about
that
you
squashed
the
crazy
things
claim
now
it
was
a
plasmoid
quillan
said
revolting
notion
but
it
makes
some
sense
for
once
checks
with
some
of
the
things
lyad
just
told
us
too
do
you
remember
that
vethi
sponge
balmordan
was
carrying
yes
it
did
come
off
the
ship
with
him
he
checked
it
out
as
having
died
en
route
that
is
a
revolting
notion
trigger
said
after
a
moment
well
at
least
we
got
detectors
now
but
the
feeling
of
security
had
faded
somewhat
again
before
dinner
was
half
over
the
transmitters
abruptly
came
to
life
for
the
next
thirty
minutes
or
so
messages
rattled
in
incessantly
as
assorted
headquarters
here
and
there
reacted
to
the
ermetyne
report
the
commissioner
sat
in
the
little
office
and
sorted
over
the
incoming
information
trigger
stayed
at
the
transmitters
feeding
it
to
him
as
it
arrived
none
of
it
affected
them
directly
they
were
already
headed
for
the
point
in
space
a
great
many
other
people
would
now
start
heading
for
very
soon
then
business
dropped
off
again
almost
as
suddenly
as
it
had
picked
up
a
half
dozen
low
priority
items
straggled
in
in
as
many
minutes
the
transmitters
purred
idly
then
the
buzzer
sounded
trigger
punched
the
screen
button
a
voice
pronounced
the
ship
dial
number
acknowledging
trigger
said
who
is
it
orado
comweb
center
said
the
voice
stand
by
for
contact
with
federation
councilman
roadgear
trigger
whacked
the
panic
button
roadgear
was
a
name
standing
by
she
said
commissioner
tate
came
in
through
the
door
and
slipped
into
the
chair
she
already
vacated
trigger
took
another
seat
a
few
feet
away
she
felt
a
little
nervous
but
she
always
wanted
to
see
a
diplomat
in
action
the
screen
lit
up
she
recognized
roadgear
from
his
pics
tall
man
of
the
silvered
sideburns
type
he
was
in
an
armchair
in
a
very
plush
office
congratulations
commissioner
he
said
smiling
i
believe
aware
by
now
that
your
latest
report
has
set
many
wheels
spinning
rapidly
i
rather
expected
it
would
the
commissioner
admitted
he
also
smiled
they
pitched
it
back
and
forth
a
few
times
very
chummy
roadgear
appear
to
be
involved
in
any
specific
way
with
the
operations
which
soon
would
center
about
luscious
trigger
began
to
wonder
what
he
was
after
a
few
of
us
are
rather
curious
to
know
roadgear
said
why
you
acknowledge
the
last
council
order
sent
you
trigger
did
quite
start
nervously
when
was
this
asked
the
commissioner
roadgear
smiled
softly
and
told
him
got
a
record
here
of
some
scrambled
item
that
arrived
about
then
the
commissioner
said
very
good
of
you
to
call
me
about
it
councilman
what
was
the
order
content
it
dated
now
as
it
happens
roadgear
said
actually
i
calling
about
another
matter
the
first
lady
of
tranest
appears
to
have
been
very
obliging
about
informing
you
of
some
of
her
recent
activities
the
commissioner
nodded
yes
very
obliging
and
in
so
short
a
time
after
her
ah
detainment
you
must
have
been
very
persuasive
well
holati
tate
said
no
more
than
usually
yes
said
councilman
roadgear
now
there
been
some
slight
concern
expressed
by
some
members
of
the
council
well
let
say
they
just
like
to
be
reassured
that
the
amenities
one
observes
in
dealing
with
a
head
of
state
actually
are
being
observed
in
this
case
i
sure
they
are
of
course
the
commissioner
was
silent
a
moment
i
was
informed
a
while
ago
he
said
that
full
responsibility
for
this
head
of
state
has
been
assigned
to
my
group
is
that
correct
the
councilman
reddened
very
slightly
quite
he
said
the
official
council
order
should
reach
you
in
a
day
or
so
well
then
said
the
commissioner
i
assure
you
and
you
can
assure
the
councilmen
who
were
feeling
concerned
that
the
amenities
are
being
observed
then
everybody
can
relax
again
is
that
all
right
no
not
quite
roadgear
said
annoyedly
in
fact
the
councilmen
would
very
much
prefer
it
commissioner
if
i
were
given
an
opportunity
to
speak
to
the
first
lady
directly
to
reassure
myself
on
the
point
well
commissioner
tate
said
she
ca
come
to
the
transmitters
right
now
she
washing
the
dishes
the
councilman
reddened
very
considerably
this
time
he
stared
at
the
commissioner
a
moment
longer
then
he
said
in
a
very
soft
voice
oh
the
hell
with
it
he
added
good
luck
commissioner
you
going
to
need
it
some
time
the
screen
went
blank
the
scouts
of
selan
independent
fleet
who
had
first
looked
this
planet
over
and
decided
to
call
it
luscious
had
selected
a
name
trigger
thought
which
probably
would
stick
because
that
was
what
it
was
at
least
in
the
area
where
they
were
camping
she
rolled
over
from
her
side
to
her
face
and
gave
herself
a
push
away
from
the
rock
she
been
regarding
contemplatively
for
the
past
few
minutes
feet
first
she
went
drifting
out
into
a
somewhat
deeper
section
of
plasmoid
creek
none
of
it
was
very
deep
there
were
pools
here
and
there
in
the
stretch
of
the
creek
she
usually
came
to
where
she
could
stand
on
her
toes
in
the
warm
clear
water
and
arms
stretched
straight
up
barely
tickle
the
surface
with
her
finger
tips
but
along
most
of
the
stretch
the
bigger
rocks
were
even
submerged
she
came
sliding
over
the
sand
to
another
rock
turned
on
her
back
and
leaned
up
against
the
rock
blinking
at
sun
reflections
along
the
water
camp
was
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
down
the
valley
its
sounds
cut
off
by
a
rise
of
the
ground
the
commissioner
ship
was
there
plus
a
half
dozen
tents
plus
a
sizable
unit
with
lab
facilities
which
selan
outfit
had
loaned
mantelish
for
the
duration
there
were
some
fifteen
twenty
people
in
all
about
the
camp
at
the
moment
they
knew
she
was
loafing
around
in
the
water
up
here
and
would
disturb
her
strictly
speaking
of
course
she
was
loafing
she
was
learning
how
to
listen
to
herself
think
she
did
feel
she
was
getting
the
knack
of
it
too
quickly
but
it
was
coming
the
best
way
seemed
to
be
to
let
go
mentally
as
much
as
possible
to
wait
without
impatience
really
to
listen
quietly
within
yourself
as
if
you
were
looking
around
in
some
strange
forest
letting
whatever
wanted
to
come
to
view
come
and
fade
again
as
something
else
rose
to
view
instead
the
main
difficulty
was
with
the
business
of
relaxing
mentally
which
was
at
all
her
natural
method
of
approaching
a
problem
but
when
she
could
do
it
information
of
a
kind
that
was
beginning
to
look
very
interesting
was
likely
to
come
filtering
into
her
awareness
whatever
was
at
work
deep
in
her
mind
and
she
could
give
a
pretty
fair
guess
at
what
it
was
now
seemed
as
weak
and
slow
as
the
psychology
service
people
had
indicated
the
traces
of
its
work
were
usually
faint
and
vague
but
gradually
the
traces
were
forming
into
some
very
definite
pictures
lazing
around
in
the
waters
of
plasmoid
creek
for
an
hour
or
so
every
morning
had
turned
out
to
be
a
helpful
part
of
the
process
on
the
flashing
run
to
luscious
subspace
all
the
way
with
the
commissioner
and
quillan
spelling
each
other
around
the
clock
at
the
controls
the
transmitters
clattering
for
attention
every
half
hour
the
ship
housekeeping
had
to
be
handled
and
somebody
besides
mantelish
needed
to
keep
a
moderately
beady
eye
on
the
ermetyne
she
had
even
thought
of
acting
on
pilch
suggestion
but
once
they
landed
there
suddenly
was
much
to
keep
her
busy
and
she
could
shift
priority
to
listening
to
herself
think
it
was
one
of
those
interim
periods
where
everything
was
being
prepared
and
nothing
had
got
started
as
a
plasmoid
planet
luscious
was
pretty
much
of
a
bust
it
was
true
that
plasmoids
were
here
it
was
also
true
that
until
fairly
recently
plasmoids
were
being
produced
here
by
the
simple
method
of
looking
where
they
were
thickest
selan
people
even
had
located
the
plasmoid
which
had
been
producing
the
others
several
days
before
mantelish
arrived
to
confirm
their
find
this
one
by
the
plasmoid
standards
of
luscious
was
a
regular
monster
some
inches
high
a
gray
mummylike
thing
dead
and
half
rotted
inside
it
was
the
first
plasmoid
with
the
possible
exception
of
whatever
had
flattened
itself
out
on
quillan
gravity
mine
known
to
have
died
there
had
been
very
considerable
excitement
when
it
was
first
discovered
because
the
description
made
it
sound
very
much
as
if
finally
located
they
had
this
one
if
trigger
had
followed
mantelish
correctly
could
be
regarded
as
a
cheap
imitation
of
and
its
productions
compared
with
the
working
plastic
life
of
harvest
moon
appeared
to
be
strictly
on
a
kindergarten
level
nuts
and
bolts
and
less
than
that
to
trigger
most
of
the
ones
that
had
been
collected
looked
like
assorted
bugs
and
worms
though
one
at
least
was
the
size
of
a
small
pig
no
form
no
pattern
mantelish
rumbled
was
the
thing
practicing
did
it
attempt
to
construct
an
assistant
and
set
it
down
here
to
test
it
well
now
he
went
off
again
to
incomprehensibilities
apparently
no
longer
entirely
dissatisfied
get
me
he
bellowed
then
this
business
will
be
solved
meanwhile
we
now
at
least
have
plasmoid
material
to
waste
we
can
experiment
boldly
come
lyad
my
dear
and
lyad
followed
him
into
the
lab
unit
where
they
went
to
work
again
dissecting
burning
stimulating
inoculating
and
so
forth
great
numbers
of
more
or
less
subplasmoids
this
morning
trigger
was
getting
down
to
the
best
semidrowsy
level
at
all
readily
and
it
might
very
well
be
that
business
you
know
she
had
told
the
commissioner
thoughtfully
the
day
before
by
the
time
we
done
lyad
will
know
more
about
plasmoids
than
anyone
in
the
hub
except
mantelish
he
did
look
concerned
wo
matter
much
by
the
time
we
done
she
and
the
rest
of
the
ermetynes
will
have
had
to
cough
up
control
of
tranest
they
broken
treaty
with
this
business
oh
trigger
said
does
lyad
know
that
sure
she
also
knows
she
getting
off
easy
if
she
were
a
federation
citizen
she
be
up
for
compulsory
rehabilitation
right
now
she
try
something
if
she
gets
half
a
chance
trigger
warned
she
sure
will
the
commissioner
said
absently
he
went
on
with
his
work
it
did
seem
to
be
lyad
that
was
bothering
trigger
lay
flat
on
her
back
in
the
shallow
sand
bar
arms
behind
her
head
feeling
the
warmth
on
her
closed
eyelids
she
watched
her
thoughts
drifting
by
slowly
it
just
might
be
quillan
ole
major
quillan
the
rescuer
in
time
of
need
the
smasher
quite
a
guy
the
water
murmured
past
her
on
the
ride
out
here
they
run
by
one
another
now
and
then
going
from
job
to
job
after
they
arrived
quillan
was
gone
three
quarters
of
the
time
helping
out
in
the
hunt
for
the
concealed
devagas
fortress
it
was
still
concealed
they
had
yet
picked
up
a
trace
but
every
so
often
he
made
it
back
to
camp
and
every
so
often
when
he
was
back
in
camp
and
did
think
she
was
looking
he
be
sitting
there
looking
at
her
trigger
grinned
happily
ole
major
quillan
being
bashful
well
now
and
that
did
it
she
could
feel
herself
relaxing
slipping
down
and
away
drifting
down
through
her
mind
farther
deeper
toward
the
tiny
voice
that
spoke
in
such
a
strange
language
and
still
was
becoming
daily
more
comprehensible
uh
say
trigger
trigger
gasped
her
eyes
flew
open
she
made
a
convulsive
effort
to
vanish
beneath
the
surface
of
the
creek
being
flat
on
the
sand
as
it
was
that
did
work
so
she
stopped
splashing
about
and
made
rapid
motions
here
and
there
instead
you
got
a
nerve
she
snapped
as
her
breath
came
back
beat
it
fast
ole
bashful
quillan
standing
on
the
bank
fifteen
feet
above
her
looked
hurt
he
also
looked
look
he
said
plaintively
i
just
came
over
to
make
sure
you
were
all
right
wild
animals
around
i
was
studying
the
color
scheme
it
at
once
quillan
inhaled
with
apparent
difficulty
though
now
it
been
mentioned
he
went
on
speaking
rapidly
and
unevenly
there
all
that
brown
and
that
sort
of
pink
and
that
lovely
white
he
was
getting
more
enthusiastic
by
the
moment
trigger
became
afraid
he
would
fall
off
the
bank
and
land
in
the
creek
beside
her
and
the
wet
red
hair
and
the
freckles
he
rattled
along
his
eyes
starting
out
of
his
head
and
the
lovely
quillan
she
yelled
please
quillan
checked
himself
uh
he
said
he
drew
a
deep
breath
the
wild
look
faded
sanity
appeared
to
return
well
it
the
truth
about
those
wild
animals
some
sort
of
large
uncouth
critter
was
observed
just
now
ducking
into
the
forest
at
the
upper
end
of
the
valley
trigger
darted
a
glance
along
the
bank
her
clothes
were
forty
feet
away
just
beside
the
water
i
observing
some
sort
of
large
uncouth
critter
right
here
she
said
coldly
what
worse
it
observing
me
turn
around
quillan
sighed
you
a
hard
woman
argee
he
said
but
he
turned
he
was
carrying
a
holstered
gun
as
a
matter
of
fact
but
he
usually
did
that
nowadays
anyway
this
thing
he
went
on
is
supposed
to
have
a
head
like
a
bat
three
feet
across
it
flies
very
interesting
trigger
told
him
she
decided
he
was
going
to
turn
around
again
so
now
i
just
get
into
my
clothes
and
then
it
came
quietly
out
of
the
trees
around
the
upper
bend
of
the
creek
sixty
feet
away
it
had
a
head
like
a
bat
and
was
blue
on
top
and
yellow
below
its
flopping
wing
tips
barely
cleared
the
bank
on
either
side
the
mouth
was
wide
open
showing
very
long
thin
white
teeth
it
came
skimming
swiftly
over
the
surface
of
the
water
toward
her
they
walked
back
along
the
trail
to
camp
trigger
walked
a
few
steps
ahead
her
back
very
straight
the
worst
of
it
had
been
the
smug
look
on
his
face
heel
she
observed
heel
heel
heel
now
trigger
quillan
said
calmly
behind
her
after
all
it
was
you
who
came
flying
up
the
bank
and
wrapped
yourself
around
my
neck
all
wet
too
i
was
scared
trigger
snarled
who
would
be
you
certainly
hesitate
an
instant
to
take
full
advantage
of
the
situation
true
quillan
admitted
i
dropped
the
bat
there
you
were
hesitate
i
not
out
of
my
mind
she
did
two
dance
steps
of
pure
rage
and
spun
to
face
him
she
put
her
hands
on
her
hips
quillan
stopped
warily
your
mind
she
said
i
hate
to
have
one
like
it
what
do
you
think
i
am
one
of
belchik
houris
for
a
man
his
size
he
was
really
extremely
quick
before
she
could
move
he
was
there
one
big
arm
wrapped
about
her
shoulders
pinning
her
arms
to
her
sides
easy
trigger
he
said
softly
well
others
had
tried
to
hold
her
like
that
when
she
did
want
to
be
held
a
twist
a
jerk
a
heave
and
over
and
down
they
went
trigger
braced
herself
quietly
if
she
was
quick
enough
now
she
twisted
jerked
heaved
she
stopped
discouraged
the
situation
had
altered
appreciably
she
been
afraid
it
was
going
to
work
with
quillan
let
go
she
said
furiously
aiming
a
fast
heel
at
his
instep
but
the
instep
flicked
aside
her
shoe
dug
into
the
turf
of
the
path
the
ape
might
even
have
an
extra
pair
of
eyes
on
his
feet
then
his
free
palm
was
cupped
under
her
chin
tilting
it
carefully
his
other
eyes
appeared
above
hers
very
close
very
dark
i
bite
trigger
whispered
fiercely
i
bi
mmph
mmmph
grrmm
mhm
they
walked
on
along
the
trail
hand
in
hand
they
came
up
over
the
last
little
rise
trigger
looked
down
on
the
camp
she
frowned
pretty
dull
she
observed
eh
quillan
asked
startled
not
that
ape
she
said
she
squeezed
his
hand
your
morals
good
but
dull
it
was
i
meant
generally
we
just
sitting
here
now
waiting
nothing
seems
to
be
happening
it
was
true
at
least
on
the
surface
there
were
a
great
number
of
ships
and
men
around
and
near
luscious
but
they
were
in
view
they
were
ready
to
jump
in
any
direction
at
any
moment
but
they
had
nothing
to
jump
at
yet
the
commissioner
transmitters
had
signaled
more
than
two
or
three
times
in
the
last
two
days
even
the
short
communicators
remained
mostly
silent
cheer
up
doll
quillan
said
something
bound
to
break
pretty
soon
that
evening
a
devagas
ship
came
zooming
in
on
luscious
they
were
prepared
for
it
of
course
that
somebody
came
round
from
time
to
time
to
look
over
the
local
plasmoid
crop
was
only
to
be
expected
as
the
ship
surfaced
in
atmosphere
on
the
other
side
of
the
planet
four
scout
fighters
flashed
in
on
it
from
four
points
of
the
horizon
radiation
screens
up
they
tacked
holding
beams
on
it
and
braced
themselves
a
federation
destroyer
appeared
in
the
air
above
it
the
devagas
ship
could
escape
so
it
blew
itself
up
they
were
prepared
for
that
too
the
devagas
pilot
was
being
three
minutes
later
he
did
know
a
significant
thing
except
the
exact
coordinates
of
an
armed
subterranean
devagas
dome
three
days
run
away
the
scout
ships
that
had
been
hunting
for
the
dome
went
howling
in
toward
it
from
every
direction
the
more
massive
naval
vessels
of
the
federation
followed
behind
there
was
no
hurry
for
the
heavies
the
captured
devagas
ship
attempt
to
beam
a
warning
to
its
base
had
been
smothered
without
effort
the
scouts
were
getting
in
fast
enough
to
block
escape
attempts
and
now
we
split
forces
the
commissioner
said
he
was
the
only
one
trigger
thought
who
did
seem
too
enormously
excited
by
it
all
quillan
you
and
your
group
get
going
they
can
use
you
there
a
whole
lot
better
than
we
can
here
for
just
a
second
quillan
looked
like
a
man
being
dragged
violently
in
two
directions
he
did
look
at
trigger
he
asked
think
it
wise
to
leave
you
people
unguarded
quillan
said
commissioner
tate
that
the
first
time
in
my
life
anybody
has
suggested
i
need
guarding
sorry
sir
said
quillan
you
mean
trigger
said
we
not
going
we
just
staying
here
you
got
an
appointment
remember
the
commissioner
said
quillan
and
company
were
gone
within
the
hour
mantelish
holati
tate
lyad
and
trigger
stayed
at
camp
luscious
looked
very
lonely
it
is
just
the
king
plasmoid
they
hoping
to
catch
there
the
commissioner
told
trigger
and
i
would
care
frankly
if
the
thing
stayed
lost
the
next
few
thousand
years
but
we
had
a
very
odd
report
last
week
the
federation
undercover
boys
have
been
scanning
the
devagas
worlds
and
tranest
very
closely
of
late
naturally
the
report
is
that
there
is
the
slightest
evidence
that
a
single
one
of
the
top
members
of
the
devagas
hierarchy
has
been
on
any
of
their
worlds
in
the
past
two
months
oh
she
said
they
think
they
out
here
in
that
dome
that
what
suspected
but
why
he
scratched
his
chin
if
anyone
knows
they
have
told
me
probably
nothing
nice
trigger
pondered
you
think
they
use
facsimiles
she
said
like
lyad
oh
they
did
he
said
they
did
that
one
of
the
reasons
for
being
pretty
sure
they
gone
they
nowhere
near
as
expert
at
that
facsimile
business
as
the
tranest
characters
a
little
study
of
the
recordings
showed
the
facs
were
just
that
trigger
pondered
again
did
they
find
anything
on
tranest
yes
one
squadron
of
those
frigates
of
the
aurora
class
they
allowed
by
treaty
ca
be
accounted
for
trigger
cupped
her
chin
in
her
hands
and
looked
at
him
is
that
why
we
stayed
on
luscious
holati
the
four
of
us
it
one
reason
that
repulsive
thing
of
yours
is
another
what
about
him
i
have
a
pretty
strong
feeling
he
said
that
while
they
probably
find
the
hierarchy
in
that
devagas
dome
they
wo
find
the
item
there
so
lyad
still
is
gambling
trigger
said
and
we
gambling
we
get
more
out
of
her
next
play
than
she
does
she
hesitated
holati
yes
when
did
you
decide
it
would
be
better
if
nobody
ever
got
to
see
that
king
plasmoid
again
holati
tate
said
about
the
time
i
saw
the
reconstruct
of
that
yellow
monster
of
balmordan
frankly
trigger
there
was
a
good
deal
of
discussion
of
possibilities
along
that
line
before
we
decided
to
announce
the
discovery
of
harvest
moon
if
we
could
have
just
kept
it
hidden
away
for
a
couple
of
centuries
until
there
was
considerably
more
good
sense
around
the
hub
we
probably
would
have
done
it
but
somebody
was
bound
to
run
across
it
sometime
and
the
stuff
did
look
as
if
it
might
be
extremely
valuable
so
we
took
the
chance
and
now
you
like
to
untake
it
if
it
still
possible
half
the
fed
council
probably
would
like
to
see
it
happen
but
they
do
even
dare
think
along
those
lines
there
could
be
a
blowup
that
would
throw
hub
politics
back
into
the
kind
of
snarl
they
have
been
in
for
a
hundred
years
if
anything
is
done
it
will
have
to
look
as
if
it
had
been
something
nobody
could
have
helped
and
that
still
might
be
bad
enough
i
suppose
so
holati
yes
she
shook
her
head
nothing
or
if
it
is
i
ask
you
later
she
stood
up
i
think
i
go
have
my
swim
she
still
went
loafing
in
plasmoid
creek
in
the
mornings
the
bat
had
been
identified
as
an
innocent
victim
of
appearances
a
very
beast
dedicated
to
the
pursuit
and
engulfment
of
huge
mothlike
bugs
which
hung
around
watercourses
luscious
still
looked
like
the
safest
of
all
possible
worlds
for
any
creature
as
vigorous
as
a
human
being
but
she
kept
the
denton
near
now
just
in
case
she
stretched
out
again
in
the
water
selected
a
smooth
rock
to
rest
her
head
on
wriggled
into
the
sand
a
little
so
the
current
would
shift
her
and
closed
her
eyes
she
lay
still
breathing
slowly
contact
was
coming
more
easily
and
quickly
every
morning
but
the
information
which
had
begun
to
filter
through
in
the
last
few
days
was
at
all
calculated
to
make
one
happy
she
was
afraid
now
she
was
going
to
die
in
this
thing
she
had
almost
let
it
slip
out
to
holati
which
would
have
helped
in
the
least
she
have
to
watch
that
in
future
repulsive
had
exactly
said
she
would
die
he
said
maybe
repulsive
was
scared
too
scared
badly
trigger
lay
quiet
her
thoughts
her
attention
drifting
softly
inward
and
down
creek
water
rippled
against
her
cheek
it
was
all
because
that
one
clock
moved
so
slowly
that
was
the
thing
that
could
be
changed
ever
three
mornings
later
the
emergency
signal
called
her
back
to
camp
on
the
double
trigger
ran
over
the
developments
of
the
past
days
in
her
mind
as
she
trotted
along
the
path
getting
dressed
more
or
less
on
the
way
the
devagas
dome
was
solidly
invested
by
now
its
transmitters
blanked
out
it
had
tried
to
communicate
with
its
attackers
on
their
part
the
fed
ships
were
pushing
the
attack
they
were
holding
the
point
waiting
for
the
big
slow
wrecking
boats
to
arrive
which
would
very
gently
and
delicately
start
uncovering
and
opening
the
dome
taking
it
apart
piece
by
piece
the
hierarchy
could
surrender
themselves
and
whatever
they
were
hiding
in
there
at
any
point
in
the
process
they
did
have
a
chance
nobody
and
nothing
had
escaped
the
scouts
had
swatted
down
a
few
devagas
vessels
on
the
way
in
but
those
had
been
headed
toward
the
dome
not
away
from
it
perhaps
the
psychology
service
ship
had
arrived
several
days
ahead
of
time
the
other
three
were
in
camp
but
the
lock
to
the
commissioner
ship
stood
open
trigger
went
in
and
found
them
gathered
up
front
the
commissioner
had
swung
the
transmitter
cabinet
aside
and
was
back
there
prowling
among
the
power
leads
what
wrong
trigger
asked
transmitters
went
out
he
said
do
know
why
yet
grab
some
tools
and
help
me
check
she
slipped
on
her
work
gloves
grabbed
some
tools
and
joined
him
lyad
and
mantelish
watched
them
silently
they
found
the
first
spots
of
the
fungus
a
few
minutes
later
fungus
mantelish
said
startled
he
began
to
rumble
in
his
pockets
my
microscope
i
have
it
lyad
handed
it
to
him
she
looked
at
him
with
concern
you
do
think
it
seems
possible
we
did
come
in
here
last
night
remember
and
we
came
straight
from
the
lab
but
we
had
been
decontaminated
lyad
said
puzzledly
do
try
to
walk
in
here
professor
trigger
warned
as
he
lumbered
forward
we
might
have
to
you
the
commissioner
will
scrape
off
a
sample
and
hand
it
out
this
stuff
if
it
what
you
think
it
might
be
is
poisonous
quite
harmless
to
life
my
dear
said
the
professor
bending
over
the
patch
of
scum
the
commissioner
had
reached
out
to
him
but
ruinous
in
delicate
instruments
that
why
we
so
careful
holati
tate
glanced
at
trigger
better
look
in
the
black
box
trig
he
said
she
nodded
and
wormed
herself
farther
into
the
innards
of
the
transmitters
a
minute
later
she
announced
full
of
it
and
that
the
one
part
we
ca
repair
or
replace
of
course
is
it
your
beast
professor
it
seems
to
be
mantelish
said
unhappily
but
we
have
at
least
a
solvent
which
will
remove
it
from
the
equipment
trigger
came
sliding
out
from
under
the
transmitters
the
detached
black
box
under
one
arm
better
use
it
then
before
the
stuff
gets
to
the
rest
of
the
ship
it
wo
help
the
black
box
she
shook
it
it
tinkled
shot
she
said
there
went
another
quarter
million
of
your
credits
commissioner
mantelish
and
lyad
headed
for
the
lock
to
get
the
solvent
trigger
slipped
off
her
work
gloves
and
turned
to
follow
them
might
be
a
while
before
i
back
she
said
the
commissioner
started
to
say
something
then
nodded
and
climbed
back
into
the
transmitters
after
a
few
minutes
mantelish
came
puffing
in
with
sprayers
and
cans
of
solvent
it
at
least
fortunate
you
tried
to
put
out
a
call
just
now
he
said
it
might
have
done
incalculable
damage
doubt
it
said
holati
a
few
more
instruments
might
have
gone
like
the
communicators
the
main
equipment
is
how
do
you
attach
this
thing
mantelish
showed
him
the
commissioner
thanked
him
he
directed
a
fine
spray
of
the
solvent
into
the
black
box
and
watched
the
fungus
melt
happen
to
notice
where
trigger
and
lyad
went
he
asked
eh
said
mantelish
he
reflected
i
saw
them
walking
down
toward
camp
talking
together
as
i
came
in
he
called
should
i
go
get
them
do
bother
holati
said
they
be
back
they
came
walking
back
into
the
ship
around
half
an
hour
later
both
faces
looked
rather
white
and
strained
lyad
has
something
she
wants
to
tell
you
holati
trigger
said
where
mantelish
in
his
lab
taking
a
nap
i
believe
that
good
we
do
want
him
here
for
this
go
ahead
lyad
just
the
important
stuff
you
can
give
us
the
details
after
we
left
three
hours
later
the
ship
was
well
away
from
luscious
traveling
subspace
traveling
fast
trigger
walked
up
into
the
control
section
mantelish
is
still
asleep
she
said
they
fed
the
professor
a
doped
drink
to
get
him
aboard
without
detailed
explanation
and
argument
about
how
much
of
the
lab
should
be
loaded
on
the
ship
first
shall
i
get
lyad
out
of
her
cabin
for
the
rest
of
the
story
or
wait
till
he
wakes
up
better
wait
said
the
commissioner
he
come
out
of
it
in
about
an
hour
and
he
might
as
well
hear
it
with
us
looks
like
going
to
be
a
little
rough
for
a
spell
anyway
trigger
nodded
and
sat
down
in
the
control
next
to
his
after
a
while
he
glanced
over
at
her
how
did
you
get
her
to
talk
he
asked
we
went
back
into
the
woods
a
bit
i
tied
her
over
a
stump
and
broke
two
sticks
across
the
first
seat
of
tranest
got
the
idea
from
mihul
sort
of
trigger
added
vaguely
when
i
picked
up
a
third
stick
lyad
got
awfully
anxious
to
keep
things
at
just
a
fast
conversational
level
we
kept
it
there
hm
said
the
commissioner
you
do
feel
she
did
any
lying
this
time
i
doubt
it
i
tapped
her
one
now
and
then
just
to
make
sure
she
slow
down
enough
to
do
much
thinking
besides
i
got
the
whole
business
down
on
a
pocket
recorder
and
lyad
knew
it
if
she
makes
one
more
goof
till
this
deal
is
over
the
recording
gets
released
to
the
hub
news
viewer
outfits
yowls
and
all
she
sooner
lose
tranest
than
risk
having
that
happen
she
be
good
yeah
probably
he
said
thoughtfully
about
that
substation
would
you
feel
more
comfortable
if
we
went
after
the
bunch
round
the
devagas
dome
first
and
got
us
an
escort
for
the
trip
sure
trigger
said
but
that
would
just
about
kill
any
chances
of
doing
anything
personally
would
it
i
afraid
so
scout
intelligence
will
go
along
pretty
far
with
me
but
they
could
go
that
far
we
might
be
able
to
contact
quillan
individually
though
he
a
topnotch
man
in
a
fighter
it
does
seem
to
me
trigger
said
that
we
ought
to
run
any
risk
of
being
spotted
till
we
know
exactly
what
this
thing
is
like
well
said
the
commissioner
i
with
you
there
we
should
what
about
mantelish
and
lyad
you
ca
let
them
know
either
the
commissioner
motioned
with
his
head
the
rest
cubicle
back
of
the
cabins
if
we
see
a
chance
to
do
anything
we
pop
them
both
into
rest
i
can
dream
up
something
to
make
that
look
plausible
afterwards
i
think
trigger
was
silent
a
moment
lyad
had
told
them
she
dispatched
the
aurora
to
stand
guard
over
a
subspace
station
where
the
missing
king
plasmoid
presently
was
housed
until
both
she
and
the
combat
squadron
from
tranest
could
arrive
there
the
exact
location
of
that
station
had
been
the
most
valuable
of
the
bits
of
information
she
had
extracted
so
painstakingly
from
balmordan
the
coordinates
were
centered
on
the
commissioner
course
screen
at
the
moment
how
about
that
tranest
squadron
trigger
asked
think
lyad
might
have
risked
a
lie
and
they
could
get
out
here
in
time
to
interfere
no
said
the
commissioner
she
had
to
have
some
idea
of
where
to
send
them
before
starting
them
out
of
the
hub
they
be
doing
fine
if
they
make
it
to
the
substation
in
another
two
weeks
now
the
aurora
if
they
started
for
luscious
right
after
lyad
called
them
last
night
at
best
they
ca
get
there
any
sooner
than
we
can
get
to
the
substation
i
figure
that
at
four
days
if
they
turn
right
around
then
and
start
back
trigger
laughed
you
can
bet
on
that
she
said
the
commissioner
had
used
his
ship
guns
to
brand
the
substation
coordinates
in
figures
into
a
mountain
plateau
above
plasmoid
creek
left
much
more
detailed
information
in
camp
but
there
was
a
chance
it
would
be
overlooked
in
too
hurried
a
search
then
they
show
up
at
the
substation
again
four
or
five
days
behind
us
the
commissioner
said
so
they
no
problem
but
our
own
fastest
ships
can
cut
across
from
the
devagas
dome
in
less
than
three
days
after
their
search
party
messages
from
luscious
to
tell
them
why
we
stopped
transmitting
and
where
we
gone
or
the
psychology
ship
might
get
to
luscious
before
the
search
party
does
and
start
transmitting
about
the
coordinates
in
any
case
said
trigger
it
our
own
boys
who
are
likely
to
be
the
problem
yes
i
say
we
have
two
days
give
or
take
a
few
hours
after
we
get
to
the
station
to
see
if
we
can
do
anything
useful
and
get
it
done
of
course
somebody
might
come
wandering
into
luscious
right
now
and
start
wondering
about
those
coordinate
figures
or
drop
in
at
our
camp
and
discover
we
gone
but
that
not
very
likely
after
all
could
be
helped
anyway
trigger
said
no
if
we
knock
ourselves
out
on
this
job
somebody
besides
tranest
squadron
and
the
devagas
has
to
know
just
where
the
station
is
he
shook
his
head
that
lyad
i
figured
she
know
how
to
run
the
transmitters
so
i
gave
her
the
chance
but
i
never
imagined
she
be
a
good
enough
engineer
to
get
inside
them
and
mess
them
up
without
killing
herself
lyad
has
her
points
trigger
said
too
bad
she
grew
up
a
rat
you
had
a
playback
attachment
stuck
in
there
then
naturally
full
of
the
fungus
i
suppose
full
of
it
said
the
commissioner
well
lyad
still
lost
on
that
maneuver
much
less
comfortably
than
she
might
have
too
i
think
she
agree
with
you
there
trigger
said
lyad
first
assignment
after
professor
mantelish
came
out
of
the
dope
was
to
snap
him
back
into
trance
and
explain
to
him
how
he
had
once
more
been
put
under
hypno
control
and
used
for
her
felonious
ends
by
the
first
lady
of
tranest
they
let
him
work
off
his
rage
while
he
was
still
under
partial
control
then
the
ermetyne
woke
him
up
he
stared
at
her
coldly
you
are
a
deceitful
woman
lyad
ermetyne
he
declared
i
do
wish
to
see
you
about
my
labs
again
at
any
time
under
any
pretext
is
that
understood
yes
professor
lyad
said
and
i
sorry
that
i
believed
it
necessary
to
mantelish
snorted
sorry
necessary
just
to
be
certain
it
happen
again
i
shall
make
up
a
batch
of
antihypno
pills
if
i
can
remember
the
prescription
i
happen
the
ermetyne
ventured
to
know
a
very
good
prescription
for
the
purpose
professor
if
you
will
permit
me
mantelish
stood
up
i
accept
no
prescriptions
from
you
he
said
icily
he
looked
at
trigger
as
he
turned
to
walk
out
of
the
cabin
or
drinks
from
you
either
trigger
argee
he
growled
who
in
the
great
spiraling
galaxy
is
there
left
to
trust
sorry
professor
trigger
said
meekly
in
half
an
hour
or
so
he
calmed
down
enough
to
join
the
others
in
the
lounge
to
get
the
final
story
on
gess
fayle
and
the
missing
king
plasmoid
from
the
ermetyne
doctor
gess
fayle
lyad
reported
had
died
very
shortly
after
leaving
the
manon
system
and
with
him
had
died
every
man
on
board
the
transport
ship
it
might
be
simplest
she
went
on
to
relate
the
first
series
of
events
from
the
plasmoid
point
of
view
point
of
view
professor
mantelish
interrupted
the
plasmoid
has
awareness
then
oh
yes
that
one
does
definitely
oho
but
then
professor
trigger
interrupted
politely
in
turn
may
i
get
you
a
drink
he
glared
at
her
growled
then
grinned
i
shut
up
he
said
lyad
went
on
doctor
fayle
had
resumed
experimentation
with
the
unit
almost
as
soon
as
he
was
alone
with
it
and
one
of
the
first
things
he
did
was
to
detach
the
small
section
from
the
main
one
the
point
doctor
fayle
had
adequately
considered
when
he
took
this
step
was
that
function
appeared
to
be
that
of
a
restraining
limiting
or
counteracting
device
on
its
vastly
larger
partner
the
old
galactics
obviously
had
been
aware
of
dangerous
potentialities
in
their
more
advanced
creations
and
had
used
this
means
of
regulating
them
that
the
method
was
reliable
was
indicated
by
the
fact
that
in
the
thirty
thousand
years
since
the
old
galactics
had
vanished
plasmoid
had
remained
restricted
to
the
operations
required
for
the
maintenance
of
harvest
moon
but
it
had
liked
being
restricted
and
it
had
been
very
much
aware
of
the
possibilities
offered
by
the
new
which
lately
had
intruded
on
harvest
moon
the
instant
it
found
itself
free
it
attempted
to
take
control
of
the
human
minds
in
its
environment
control
mantelish
exclaimed
looking
startled
not
of
course
and
we
been
considering
but
of
minds
lyad
nodded
it
can
contact
human
minds
she
said
though
perhaps
rather
fortunately
it
can
project
that
particular
field
effect
only
within
a
quite
limited
radius
a
little
less
the
devagas
found
later
than
five
miles
mantelish
shook
his
head
frowning
he
turned
toward
the
commissioner
holati
he
said
emphatically
i
believe
that
thing
could
be
dangerous
for
a
moment
they
all
looked
at
him
then
the
commissioner
cleared
his
throat
it
a
possibility
mantelish
he
admitted
we
will
give
it
thought
later
what
trigger
asked
lyad
killed
the
people
on
the
ship
the
attempt
to
control
them
lyad
said
doctor
fayle
apparently
had
died
as
he
was
leaving
the
laboratory
with
the
unit
the
other
men
died
wherever
they
were
the
ship
running
subspace
and
pilotless
plowed
headlong
into
the
next
gravitic
twister
and
broke
up
a
devagas
ship
detectors
picked
up
the
wreckage
three
days
later
balmordan
was
on
board
the
devagas
ship
and
in
charge
the
devagas
at
that
time
were
at
least
as
as
anybody
else
and
knew
they
were
not
likely
to
see
their
hunger
gratified
for
several
decades
the
wreck
of
a
ship
in
the
manon
area
decidedly
was
worth
investigating
if
the
big
plasmoid
had
been
capable
of
learning
from
its
mistakes
the
devagas
investigating
party
also
would
have
died
since
it
could
and
did
learn
they
lived
the
searchers
discovered
human
remains
and
the
crushed
remnants
of
the
unit
in
a
collapsed
section
of
the
ship
then
they
discovered
the
big
plasmoid
alive
in
subspace
undamaged
and
very
conscious
of
the
difficulties
it
now
faced
it
had
already
initiated
its
first
attempt
to
solve
the
difficulties
it
was
incapable
of
outward
motion
and
could
not
change
its
own
structure
but
it
was
no
longer
alone
it
had
constructed
a
small
with
visual
and
manipulating
organs
as
indifferent
to
exposure
to
subspace
as
its
designer
when
the
boarding
party
encountered
the
twain
the
working
plasmoid
apparently
was
attempting
to
perform
some
operation
on
the
frozen
and
shriveled
brain
of
one
of
the
human
cadavers
balmordan
was
a
scientist
of
no
mean
stature
among
the
devagas
he
did
not
understand
immediately
what
he
saw
but
he
realized
the
probable
importance
of
understanding
it
he
had
the
plasmoids
and
their
lifeless
human
research
object
transferred
to
the
devagas
ship
and
settled
down
to
observe
what
they
did
released
the
working
plasmoid
went
back
immediately
to
its
task
it
completed
it
then
balmordan
and
presumably
the
plasmoids
waited
nothing
happened
finally
balmordan
investigated
the
dead
brain
installed
in
it
he
found
what
appeared
to
be
energy
receivers
of
plasmoid
material
there
was
nothing
to
indicate
what
type
of
energy
they
were
to
or
could
receive
devagas
scientists
when
they
happened
to
be
of
the
hierarchy
always
had
enjoyed
one
great
advantage
over
most
of
their
colleagues
in
the
federation
they
had
no
difficulty
in
obtaining
human
volunteers
to
act
as
subjects
for
experimental
work
balmordan
appointed
three
of
his
least
valuable
crew
members
as
volunteers
for
the
experiments
the
first
of
the
three
died
almost
immediately
the
plasmoid
it
turned
out
lacked
understanding
of
among
other
things
the
use
and
need
of
anesthetics
balmordan
accordingly
assisted
obligingly
in
the
second
operation
he
was
delighted
when
it
became
apparent
that
his
assistance
was
being
willingly
and
comprehendingly
accepted
this
subject
did
not
die
immediately
but
he
did
not
regain
consciousness
after
the
plasmoid
devices
had
been
installed
and
some
hours
later
he
did
die
in
convulsions
number
three
was
more
fortunate
he
regained
consciousness
he
complained
of
headaches
and
after
he
had
slept
of
nightmares
the
next
day
he
went
into
shock
for
a
period
of
several
hours
when
he
came
out
of
it
he
reported
tremblingly
that
the
big
plasmoid
was
talking
to
him
though
he
could
not
understand
what
it
said
there
were
two
more
test
operations
both
successful
in
all
three
cases
the
headaches
and
nightmares
stopped
in
about
a
week
the
first
subject
in
the
series
was
beginning
to
understand
the
plasmoid
balmordan
listened
to
his
reports
he
had
his
three
surviving
volunteers
given
very
extensive
physical
and
psychological
tests
they
seemed
to
be
in
fine
condition
balmordan
now
had
the
operation
performed
on
himself
when
he
woke
up
he
disposed
of
his
three
predecessors
then
he
devoted
his
full
attention
to
learning
what
the
plasmoid
was
trying
to
say
in
about
three
weeks
it
became
clear
the
plasmoid
had
established
contact
with
human
beings
because
it
needed
their
help
it
needed
a
base
like
harvest
moon
from
which
to
operate
and
on
which
to
provide
for
its
requirements
it
did
not
have
the
understanding
to
permit
it
to
construct
such
a
base
so
it
made
the
devagas
a
proposition
it
would
work
for
them
somewhat
as
it
had
worked
for
the
old
galactics
if
unlike
the
old
galactics
they
would
work
for
it
balmordan
newly
become
a
person
of
foremost
importance
transmitted
the
offer
to
the
hierarchy
in
the
hub
with
no
hesitation
it
was
accepted
but
balmordan
was
warned
not
to
bring
his
monster
into
the
hub
area
if
it
was
discovered
on
a
devagas
world
the
hierarchy
would
be
faced
with
the
choice
between
another
war
with
the
federation
and
submission
to
more
severely
restrictive
federation
controls
it
did
care
for
either
alternative
it
had
lost
three
wars
with
the
federated
worlds
in
the
past
and
each
time
had
been
reduced
in
strength
they
contacted
vishni
independent
fleet
vishni
area
was
not
too
far
from
balmordan
ship
position
and
the
devagas
had
had
previous
dealings
with
him
and
his
men
this
time
they
hired
the
to
become
the
plasmoid
temporary
caretaker
within
a
few
weeks
it
was
parked
on
luscious
where
it
devoted
itself
to
the
minor
creative
experimentation
which
presently
was
to
puzzle
professor
mantelish
the
devagas
meanwhile
toiled
prodigiously
to
complete
the
constructions
which
were
to
be
a
central
feature
in
the
new
alliance
on
a
base
very
far
removed
from
the
hub
on
a
base
securely
anchored
and
concealed
among
the
gravitic
swirlings
and
shiftings
of
a
subspace
turbulence
area
virtually
indetectable
the
monster
could
make
a
very
valuable
partner
if
it
was
discovered
the
partnership
could
be
disowned
so
could
the
fact
that
they
had
constructed
the
substation
for
it
in
itself
a
grave
breach
of
federation
treaties
they
built
the
substation
they
built
the
armed
subterranean
dome
three
days
travel
away
from
it
the
plasmoid
was
installed
in
its
new
quarters
it
then
requested
the
use
of
the
vishni
fleet
people
for
further
experimentation
the
hierarchy
was
glad
to
grant
the
request
it
would
have
had
to
get
rid
of
those
too
well
informed
hirelings
in
any
case
having
received
its
experimental
material
the
plasmoid
requested
the
devagas
to
stay
away
from
the
substation
for
a
while
the
devagas
said
lyad
while
not
too
happy
with
their
increasingly
independent
attitude
were
more
anxious
than
ever
to
see
the
alliance
progress
to
the
working
stage
as
an
indication
of
its
potential
usefulness
the
monster
had
provided
them
with
a
variety
of
working
plasmoid
robots
built
to
their
own
specifications
what
kind
of
specifications
trigger
inquired
lyad
had
learned
in
detail
but
some
of
the
robots
appeared
to
have
demonstrated
rather
alarming
possibilities
those
possibilities
however
were
precisely
what
intrigued
the
hierarchy
most
mantelish
smacked
his
lips
thoughtfully
and
shook
his
head
not
good
he
said
not
at
all
good
i
beginning
to
think
he
paused
a
moment
go
on
lyad
the
hierarchy
was
now
giving
renewed
consideration
to
a
curious
request
the
plasmoid
had
made
almost
as
soon
as
balmordan
became
capable
of
understanding
it
the
request
had
been
to
find
and
destroy
plasmoid
the
ermetyne
amber
eyes
switched
to
trigger
shall
i
she
asked
trigger
nodded
and
a
specific
human
being
the
devagas
already
had
established
that
this
human
being
must
be
trigger
argee
mantelish
thick
white
eyebrows
shot
up
we
can
understand
it
is
afraid
of
being
in
some
way
brought
back
under
control
but
why
trigger
because
lyad
said
carefully
was
aware
that
intended
to
condition
trigger
into
being
its
interpreter
professor
mantelish
jaw
dropped
he
swung
his
head
toward
trigger
is
that
true
she
nodded
it
true
all
right
we
been
working
on
it
but
we
have
got
too
far
along
tell
you
later
go
ahead
lyad
the
devagas
naturally
had
acted
on
the
king
plasmoid
naive
suggestion
whatever
it
feared
was
more
than
likely
to
be
very
useful
to
them
instead
they
made
preparations
to
bring
both
and
trigger
argee
into
their
possession
they
would
then
have
a
new
strong
bargaining
point
in
their
dealings
with
their
dubious
partner
but
they
discovered
promptly
that
neither
trigger
nor
were
at
all
easy
to
come
by
balmordan
now
suggested
a
modification
of
tactics
the
hierarchy
had
seen
to
it
that
a
number
of
interpreters
were
available
for
balmordan
in
consequence
had
lost
much
of
his
early
importance
and
was
anxious
to
regain
it
his
proposal
was
that
all
efforts
should
be
directed
at
obtaining
once
it
was
obtained
he
himself
would
volunteer
to
become
its
first
interpreter
trigger
argee
because
of
the
information
she
might
reveal
to
others
should
be
destroyed
a
far
simpler
operation
than
attempting
to
take
her
alive
this
was
agreed
to
and
balmordan
was
authorized
to
carry
out
both
operations
mantelish
had
begun
shaking
his
head
again
no
he
said
suddenly
and
loudly
he
looked
at
lyad
then
at
trigger
trigger
he
said
yes
said
trigger
take
that
deceitful
woman
to
her
cabin
mantelish
ordered
lock
her
up
i
have
something
to
say
to
the
commissioner
trigger
arose
all
right
she
said
come
on
lyad
the
two
of
them
left
the
lounge
mantelish
stood
up
and
went
over
to
the
commissioner
he
grasped
the
commissioner
jacket
lapels
holati
old
friend
he
began
emotionally
what
is
it
old
friend
the
commissioner
inquired
what
i
have
to
say
mantelish
rumbled
will
shock
you
profoundly
no
exclaimed
the
commissioner
yes
said
mantelish
that
plasmoid
it
has
of
course
an
almost
inestimable
potential
value
to
civilization
of
course
the
commissioner
agreed
but
it
also
said
mantelish
represents
a
quite
intolerable
threat
to
civilization
mantelish
cried
the
commissioner
it
does
you
do
comprehend
these
matters
as
i
do
holati
that
plasmoid
must
be
destroyed
secretly
if
possible
and
by
us
mantelish
gasped
the
commissioner
you
ca
be
serious
i
am
well
said
commissioner
tate
sit
down
i
open
to
suggestions
drill
had
been
featured
much
in
the
colonial
crowded
curriculum
but
the
commissioner
broke
out
one
of
the
ship
two
suits
and
when
trigger
was
at
the
controls
eating
sleeping
or
taking
care
of
the
ship
housekeeping
with
lyad
and
mantelish
she
drilled
she
was
at
the
controls
too
often
when
she
was
they
had
to
surface
and
proceed
in
normal
space
but
lyad
not
too
surprisingly
turned
out
to
be
a
qualified
subspace
pilot
even
less
surprisingly
she
already
had
made
a
careful
study
of
the
ship
controls
after
a
few
hours
of
instruction
she
went
on
shift
with
the
commissioner
along
the
less
rugged
stretches
in
this
area
none
of
the
stretches
were
smooth
when
not
on
duty
lyad
lay
on
her
bunk
and
brooded
mantelish
tried
to
be
useful
repulsive
might
have
been
brooding
too
he
did
make
himself
noticeable
time
passed
the
stretches
got
rougher
the
last
ten
hours
the
commissioner
did
stir
out
of
the
control
seat
lyad
had
been
locked
in
her
cabin
again
as
the
critical
period
approached
in
normal
space
the
substation
should
have
been
in
clear
detector
range
by
now
here
the
detectors
gave
occasional
blurry
uncertain
indications
that
somewhere
in
the
swirling
energies
about
them
might
be
something
more
solidly
material
it
was
like
creeping
through
jungle
thickets
towards
the
point
where
a
dangerous
quarry
lurked
they
eased
down
on
the
coordinate
points
they
came
sliding
out
between
two
monstrous
twisters
the
detectors
leaped
to
life
ship
said
the
commissioner
he
swore
frigate
class
he
said
an
instant
later
he
turned
his
head
toward
trigger
get
lyad
they
in
communication
range
we
let
her
communicate
trigger
heart
hammering
ran
to
get
lyad
the
commissioner
had
the
communicator
on
when
they
came
hurrying
back
to
the
control
room
together
that
the
aurora
he
asked
lyad
glanced
at
the
outline
in
the
detectors
it
is
her
face
went
white
talk
to
he
ordered
know
their
call
number
of
course
lyad
sat
down
at
the
communicator
her
hands
shook
for
a
moment
then
steadied
what
am
i
to
say
just
find
out
what
happened
to
start
with
why
they
still
here
then
we
improvise
get
them
to
come
to
the
screen
if
you
can
lyad
fingers
flew
over
the
tabs
the
communicator
signaled
contact
lyad
said
evenly
come
in
aurora
this
is
the
ermetyne
there
was
a
pause
a
rather
unaccountably
long
pause
trigger
thought
then
a
voice
said
yes
first
lady
lyad
eyes
widened
for
an
instant
come
in
on
visual
captain
there
was
the
snap
of
command
in
the
words
again
a
pause
then
suddenly
the
communicator
was
looking
into
the
aurora
control
room
a
rather
man
in
uniform
sat
before
the
other
screen
there
were
other
uniformed
men
behind
him
trigger
heard
the
ermetyne
breath
suck
in
and
turned
to
watch
lyad
face
why
have
you
carried
out
your
instructions
captain
the
voice
was
still
even
there
was
a
difficulty
with
the
engines
first
lady
lyad
nodded
very
well
stand
by
for
new
instructions
she
switched
off
the
communicator
she
twisted
around
toward
the
commissioner
get
us
out
of
here
she
said
those
are
my
men
flame
bellowed
about
them
in
subspace
the
commissioner
hand
slapped
a
button
the
flame
vanished
and
stars
shone
all
around
the
engines
hurled
them
forward
twelve
seconds
later
they
angled
and
dived
again
subspace
reappeared
guess
you
were
right
the
commissioner
said
he
idled
the
engines
and
scratched
his
chin
but
what
were
they
everything
about
it
was
wrong
lyad
was
saying
presently
her
face
still
white
their
faces
in
particular
were
deformed
she
looked
at
trigger
you
saw
it
trigger
nodded
she
suspected
she
was
on
the
side
herself
the
captain
she
said
i
did
look
at
the
others
it
looked
as
if
his
cheeks
and
forehead
were
pushed
out
of
shape
there
was
a
short
silence
well
said
the
commissioner
seems
like
that
plasmoid
has
been
doing
some
more
experimenting
question
is
how
did
it
get
to
them
they
did
find
any
answers
to
that
lyad
insisted
the
aurora
had
been
given
specific
orders
to
avoid
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
substation
its
only
purpose
there
was
to
observe
and
report
on
anything
that
seemed
to
be
going
on
in
the
area
she
could
imagine
her
crew
disobeying
the
orders
that
control
business
trigger
said
finally
maybe
found
a
way
of
going
out
to
she
could
see
by
their
faces
that
the
idea
had
occurred
and
that
they
did
like
it
well
neither
did
she
they
pitched
a
few
more
ideas
around
none
of
them
seemed
helpful
unless
we
just
want
to
hightail
it
the
commissioner
said
finally
about
the
only
thing
we
can
do
is
go
back
and
slug
it
out
with
the
frigate
first
we
ca
risk
snooping
around
the
station
while
there
and
likely
to
start
pounding
on
our
backs
any
second
mantelish
looked
startled
holati
he
cautioned
that
a
warship
mantelish
the
commissioner
said
a
trifle
coldly
what
you
been
riding
in
is
a
canoe
he
glanced
at
lyad
i
suppose
you
feel
happier
if
you
were
locked
up
in
your
cabin
during
the
ruckus
lyad
gave
him
a
strained
smile
commissioner
she
said
you
so
right
then
keep
your
seat
he
said
we
start
prowling
they
prowled
it
took
an
hour
to
recontact
the
aurora
presumably
because
the
aurora
was
also
prowling
for
them
suddenly
the
detectors
came
alive
the
ship
guns
went
off
at
once
then
subspace
went
careening
crazily
past
in
the
screens
trigger
looked
at
the
screens
for
a
few
seconds
gulped
and
started
studying
the
floor
whatever
the
plasmoid
had
done
to
the
frigate
crew
they
appeared
to
have
lost
none
of
their
ability
to
give
battle
it
was
a
very
brisk
affair
but
neither
had
the
onetime
squadron
commander
tate
lost
much
of
his
talent
along
those
lines
the
frigate
had
many
more
guns
but
no
better
range
and
he
had
the
faster
ship
four
minutes
after
the
first
shots
were
exchanged
the
aurora
blew
up
the
ripped
hunk
of
the
aurora
hull
which
the
commissioner
presently
brought
into
the
lock
appeared
to
have
had
three
approximately
holes
driven
at
a
slant
through
it
which
subsequently
had
been
plugged
again
the
plugging
material
was
plasmoid
in
character
there
were
two
holes
in
another
piece
the
commissioner
said
very
thoughtfully
if
that
the
average
she
was
punched
in
a
few
thousand
spots
let
go
have
a
better
look
he
and
mantelish
maneuvered
the
gravity
crane
carrying
the
holed
slab
of
into
the
ship
workshop
lyad
was
locked
back
into
her
cabin
and
trigger
went
on
guard
in
the
control
room
and
looked
out
wistfully
at
the
stars
of
normal
space
half
an
hour
later
the
two
men
came
up
the
passage
and
joined
her
they
appeared
preoccupied
it
an
unpleasant
picture
trigger
girl
the
commissioner
said
those
holes
look
sort
of
chewed
through
whatever
did
the
chewing
was
also
apparently
capable
of
sealing
up
the
portion
behind
it
as
it
went
along
what
it
did
to
the
men
when
it
got
inside
we
do
know
mantelish
feels
we
might
compare
it
roughly
to
the
effects
of
ordinary
germ
invasion
it
does
really
matter
it
fixed
them
mighty
large
germs
trigger
said
why
did
their
meteor
reflectors
stop
them
if
the
ship
was
hove
to
and
these
things
just
drifted
in
gradually
oh
i
see
that
would
activate
the
reflectors
then
if
we
keep
moving
ourselves
that
said
the
commissioner
was
what
i
had
in
mind
trigger
could
keep
from
staring
at
the
subspace
station
it
was
unbelievable
one
could
still
tell
that
the
human
construction
gangs
had
put
up
a
standard
type
of
armored
station
down
there
a
very
big
very
massive
one
but
normally
shaped
nearly
spherical
one
could
tell
it
only
by
the
fact
that
at
the
gun
pits
the
original
material
still
showed
through
everywhere
else
it
had
vanished
under
great
black
masses
of
material
which
the
plasmoids
had
added
to
the
station
structure
all
over
that
black
lumpy
lavalike
surface
the
plasmoids
crawled
walked
soared
and
wriggled
there
were
thousands
of
them
perhaps
hundreds
of
different
types
it
looked
like
a
wet
black
rotten
stump
swarming
with
life
inside
and
out
neither
she
nor
the
two
men
had
made
much
mention
of
its
appearance
all
you
could
say
was
that
it
was
horrible
the
plasmoids
they
could
see
ignored
the
ship
they
also
gave
no
noticeable
attention
to
the
eight
space
flares
the
commissioner
had
set
in
a
rough
cube
about
the
station
but
for
the
first
two
hours
after
their
arrival
the
ship
meteor
reflectors
remained
active
an
occasional
tap
at
first
then
an
almost
continuous
pecking
finally
a
drumfire
that
filled
the
reflector
screens
with
madly
dancing
clouds
of
tiny
sparks
suddenly
it
ended
either
the
king
plasmoid
had
exhausted
its
supply
of
that
particular
weapon
or
it
preferred
to
conserve
what
it
had
left
might
test
their
guns
the
commissioner
muttered
he
looked
very
unhappy
trigger
thought
he
circled
off
put
on
speed
came
back
and
flicked
the
ship
past
the
station
flank
he
drew
bursts
from
two
pits
with
a
promptness
which
confirmed
what
already
had
been
almost
a
certainty
that
the
gun
installations
operated
automatically
they
seemed
remarkably
feeble
weapons
for
a
station
of
that
size
the
devagas
apparently
had
had
sense
enough
not
to
give
the
plasmoid
every
advantage
the
commissioner
plunked
a
test
shot
next
into
one
of
the
black
protuberances
a
small
fiery
crater
appeared
it
darkened
quickly
again
out
of
the
biggest
opening
down
near
what
would
have
been
the
foot
of
the
stump
if
it
had
been
a
stump
something
long
red
and
wormlike
wriggled
rapidly
it
flowed
up
over
the
structure
surface
to
the
damaged
point
and
thrust
the
tip
of
its
front
end
into
the
crater
black
material
began
to
flow
from
the
tip
the
plasmoid
moved
its
front
end
back
and
forth
across
the
damaged
area
others
of
the
same
kind
came
out
and
joined
it
the
crater
began
to
fill
out
they
hauled
away
a
little
and
surfaced
normal
space
looked
clean
beautiful
homelike
calmly
shining
none
of
them
except
lyad
had
slept
for
over
twenty
hours
what
do
you
think
the
commissioner
asked
they
discussed
what
they
had
seen
in
subdued
voices
nobody
had
a
plan
they
agreed
that
one
thing
they
could
be
sure
of
was
that
the
vishni
fleet
people
and
any
other
human
beings
who
might
have
been
on
the
station
when
it
was
turned
over
to
the
king
plasmoid
were
no
longer
alive
unless
of
course
something
had
been
done
to
them
much
more
drastic
than
had
happened
to
the
aurora
crew
the
ship
had
passed
by
the
biggest
opening
like
a
low
wide
black
mouth
close
enough
to
make
out
that
it
extended
far
back
into
the
original
station
interior
the
station
was
open
and
airless
as
harvest
moon
had
been
before
the
humans
got
there
some
of
those
things
down
there
the
commissioner
said
had
attachments
that
would
crack
any
suit
wide
open
a
lot
of
them
are
big
and
a
lot
of
them
are
fast
once
we
were
inside
we
have
no
maneuverability
to
speak
of
if
the
termites
did
get
to
us
before
we
got
inside
suits
wo
do
it
here
he
was
a
gambler
and
a
gambler
does
buck
impossible
odds
what
could
you
do
with
the
guns
trigger
asked
not
too
much
they
not
meant
to
take
down
a
fortress
scratching
around
on
the
surface
with
them
would
just
mark
the
thing
up
we
can
widen
that
opening
by
quite
a
bit
and
once
it
widened
i
can
flip
in
the
bomb
but
it
would
be
just
blind
luck
if
we
nailed
the
one
after
that
way
with
a
dozen
bombs
we
could
break
up
the
station
but
we
do
have
them
they
nodded
thoughtfully
the
worst
part
of
that
he
went
on
is
that
it
would
be
completely
obvious
the
council
right
when
it
worries
about
fumbles
here
tranest
and
the
devagas
know
the
thing
is
in
there
if
the
federation
produce
it
both
those
outfits
have
the
council
over
a
barrel
or
we
could
be
setting
the
hub
up
for
fifty
years
of
fighting
among
the
member
worlds
sometime
in
the
next
few
hours
mantelish
and
trigger
nodded
again
more
thoughtfully
nevertheless
mantelish
began
suddenly
he
checked
himself
well
you
right
the
commissioner
said
that
stuff
down
there
just
ca
be
turned
loose
that
all
the
thing
still
only
experimenting
we
do
know
what
it
going
to
wind
up
with
so
i
guess
we
be
trying
the
guns
and
the
bomb
finally
and
then
see
what
else
we
can
do
now
look
we
got
what
is
it
nine
or
ten
hours
left
the
first
of
the
boys
are
pretty
sure
to
come
helling
in
around
then
or
maybe
something
happened
we
do
know
about
and
they
be
here
in
thirty
minutes
we
ca
tell
but
i
in
favor
of
knocking
off
now
and
just
grabbing
a
couple
of
hours
sleep
then
we
get
our
brains
together
again
maybe
by
then
somebody
has
come
up
with
something
like
an
idea
what
do
you
say
where
mantelish
said
is
the
ship
going
to
be
while
we
sleeping
subspace
said
the
commissioner
he
saw
their
expressions
worry
i
put
her
on
a
wide
orbit
and
i
stick
out
every
alarm
on
board
i
also
sleep
in
the
control
chair
but
in
case
somebody
gets
here
early
we
got
to
be
around
to
tell
them
about
that
space
termite
trick
trigger
had
expected
she
would
be
able
to
sleep
not
where
they
were
but
afterwards
she
could
even
remember
getting
stretched
out
all
the
way
on
the
bunk
she
woke
up
less
than
an
hour
later
feeling
very
uncomfortable
repulsive
had
been
talking
to
her
she
sat
up
and
looked
around
the
dark
cabin
with
frightened
eyes
after
a
moment
she
got
out
of
the
bunk
and
went
up
the
passage
toward
the
lounge
and
the
control
section
holati
tate
was
lying
slumped
back
in
his
chair
eyes
closed
breathing
slowly
and
evenly
trigger
put
out
a
hand
to
touch
his
shoulder
and
then
drew
it
back
she
glanced
up
for
a
moment
at
the
plasmoid
station
in
the
screen
seeming
to
turn
slowly
as
they
went
orbiting
by
it
she
noticed
that
one
of
the
space
flares
they
planted
there
had
gone
out
or
else
it
had
been
plucked
away
by
a
passing
twister
touch
she
looked
away
quickly
again
turned
and
went
restlessly
back
through
the
lounge
and
up
the
passage
toward
the
cabins
she
went
by
the
two
suits
of
space
armor
at
the
lock
without
looking
at
them
she
opened
the
door
to
mantelish
cabin
and
looked
inside
the
professor
lay
sprawled
across
the
bunk
in
his
clothes
breathing
slowly
and
regularly
trigger
closed
his
door
again
lyad
might
be
wakeful
she
thought
she
crossed
the
passage
and
unlocked
the
door
to
the
ermetyne
cabin
the
lights
in
the
cabin
were
on
but
lyad
also
lay
there
placidly
asleep
her
face
relaxed
and
young
looking
trigger
put
her
fist
to
her
mouth
and
bit
down
hard
on
her
knuckles
for
a
moment
she
frowned
intensely
at
nothing
then
she
closed
and
locked
the
cabin
door
went
back
up
the
passage
and
into
the
control
room
she
sat
down
before
the
communicator
glanced
up
once
more
at
the
plasmoid
station
in
the
screen
got
up
restlessly
and
went
over
to
the
commissioner
chair
she
stood
there
looking
down
at
him
the
commissioner
slept
on
then
repulsive
said
it
again
no
trigger
whispered
fiercely
i
wo
i
ca
you
ca
make
me
do
it
there
was
a
stillness
then
in
the
stillness
it
was
made
very
clear
that
nobody
intended
to
make
her
do
anything
and
then
the
stillness
just
waited
she
cried
a
little
so
this
was
it
all
right
she
said
the
armor
suit
triple
blazed
into
the
wide
low
black
mouth
rushing
toward
her
it
was
much
bigger
than
she
had
thought
when
looking
at
it
from
the
ship
far
behind
her
the
fire
needles
of
the
single
gun
pit
which
her
passage
to
the
station
had
aroused
still
slashed
mindlessly
about
they
were
geared
to
stop
suits
and
they
had
come
anywhere
near
her
but
the
plasmoids
looked
geared
to
stop
suits
they
were
swarming
in
clusters
in
the
black
mouth
like
maggots
in
a
rotting
skull
part
of
the
swarms
had
spilled
out
over
the
lips
of
the
mouth
clinging
crawling
rippling
swiftly
about
trigger
shifted
the
flight
controls
with
the
fingers
of
one
hand
dropping
a
little
then
straightening
again
she
might
be
coming
in
too
fast
but
she
had
to
get
past
that
mass
at
the
opening
then
the
black
mouth
suddenly
yawned
wide
before
her
her
left
hand
pressed
the
gun
handle
twin
blasts
stabbed
ahead
blinding
white
struck
the
churning
masses
blazed
over
them
they
burned
scattered
exploded
and
rolled
back
burning
and
exploding
in
a
double
wave
to
meet
her
too
fast
repulsive
said
anxiously
much
too
fast
she
knew
it
but
she
could
have
forced
herself
to
do
it
slowly
the
armor
suit
slammed
at
a
slant
into
a
piled
writhing
burning
hardness
of
plasmoid
bodies
bounced
upward
she
went
over
and
over
yanking
down
all
the
way
on
the
flight
controls
she
closed
her
eyes
for
a
moment
when
she
opened
them
again
the
suit
hung
poised
a
little
above
black
uneven
flooring
turned
back
half
toward
the
entrance
mouth
a
black
ceiling
was
less
than
twenty
feet
above
her
head
the
plasmoids
were
there
the
suit
light
beams
played
over
the
massed
moving
ranks
squat
bodies
and
sinuous
ones
immensities
that
scraped
the
ceiling
stalked
limbs
and
gaping
nutcracker
jaws
blurs
of
motion
her
eyes
could
step
down
to
define
into
shapes
some
still
blazed
with
her
guns
white
fire
the
closest
were
thirty
feet
away
they
stayed
there
they
did
come
any
closer
she
swung
the
suit
slowly
away
from
the
entrance
the
ring
was
closed
all
about
her
but
it
was
tightening
repulsive
had
thought
he
could
do
it
she
asked
in
her
mind
which
way
she
got
a
feeling
of
direction
turned
the
suit
a
little
more
and
started
it
gliding
forward
the
ranks
ahead
did
give
way
but
they
went
down
those
that
could
go
down
some
were
built
for
it
the
suit
bumped
up
gently
against
one
huge
bulk
and
a
pale
blue
eye
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
as
she
went
circling
around
it
eyes
for
what
somebody
in
the
back
of
her
mind
wondered
briefly
she
glanced
into
the
suit
rear
view
screen
and
saw
that
the
ones
who
had
gone
down
were
getting
up
again
mixed
with
the
ones
who
came
crowding
after
her
thirty
feet
away
repulsive
was
doing
it
so
far
there
were
any
guns
if
they
hit
guns
that
would
be
her
job
and
the
suit
the
king
plasmoid
should
be
regretting
by
now
that
it
had
wasted
its
experimental
human
material
though
it
might
have
been
really
wasted
it
might
be
incorporated
in
the
stuff
that
came
crowding
after
her
and
kept
going
down
ahead
black
ceiling
black
floor
seemed
to
stretch
on
endlessly
she
kept
the
suit
moving
slowly
along
at
last
the
beams
picked
up
low
walls
ahead
converging
at
the
point
toward
which
the
suit
was
gliding
at
the
point
of
convergence
there
seemed
to
be
a
narrow
passage
plasmoid
bodies
were
wedged
into
it
the
suit
pulled
them
out
one
by
one
its
steel
grippers
clamping
down
upon
things
no
softer
than
itself
but
it
had
power
to
work
with
and
they
did
at
the
moment
behind
the
ones
it
pulled
out
there
were
presently
glimpses
of
the
swiftly
weaving
motion
of
giant
red
sealing
up
the
passage
after
a
while
they
stopped
weaving
each
time
the
suit
returned
and
started
again
as
it
withdrew
dragging
out
another
plasmoid
body
then
the
suit
went
gliding
over
a
stilled
tangle
of
red
worm
bodies
and
there
was
the
sealed
end
of
the
passage
the
stuff
was
still
soft
the
guns
blazed
bit
into
it
ate
it
away
their
brilliance
washing
back
over
the
suit
the
sealing
gave
way
before
the
suit
did
they
went
through
and
came
out
into
she
did
know
what
they
had
come
out
into
it
was
like
a
fog
of
darkness
growing
thicker
as
they
went
sliding
forward
the
light
beams
seemed
to
be
dimming
then
they
quietly
went
out
as
if
they
switched
themselves
off
in
blackness
she
fingered
the
light
controls
and
knew
they
switched
off
repulsive
she
cried
in
her
mind
repulsive
could
help
with
the
blackness
she
got
the
feeling
of
direction
the
blackness
seemed
to
be
soaking
behind
her
eyes
she
held
the
speed
throttle
steady
in
fingers
slippery
with
sweat
and
that
was
the
only
way
she
could
tell
they
were
still
moving
forward
after
a
while
they
bumped
gently
against
something
that
had
to
be
a
wall
it
was
so
big
though
at
first
she
was
sure
it
was
a
wall
they
moved
along
it
for
a
time
then
came
to
the
end
of
it
and
were
moving
in
the
right
direction
again
they
seemed
to
be
in
a
passage
now
a
rather
narrow
one
they
touched
walls
and
ceiling
from
time
to
time
she
thought
they
were
moving
downward
there
was
a
picture
in
front
of
her
she
realized
suddenly
that
she
had
been
watching
it
for
some
time
but
it
was
until
this
moment
that
she
became
really
aware
of
it
the
beast
was
big
strong
and
angry
it
bellowed
and
screamed
shaking
and
covered
with
foam
she
could
see
it
too
clearly
but
she
had
the
impression
of
mad
staring
eyes
and
a
terrible
lust
to
crush
and
destroy
but
something
was
holding
it
something
held
it
quietly
and
firmly
for
all
its
plunging
it
reared
once
more
now
a
gross
lumbering
hugeness
and
came
crashing
down
to
its
knees
then
it
went
over
on
its
side
the
suit
beams
flashed
on
trigger
squeezed
her
eyes
tight
shut
blinded
by
the
light
that
flashed
back
from
black
walls
all
around
then
her
fingers
remembered
the
right
drill
and
dimmed
the
lights
she
opened
her
eyes
again
and
stared
for
a
long
moment
at
the
great
gray
before
one
of
the
black
walls
repulsive
she
asked
in
her
mind
repulsive
did
answer
the
suit
hung
quietly
in
the
huge
black
chamber
she
did
remember
having
stopped
it
she
turned
it
now
slowly
there
were
eight
or
nine
passages
leading
out
of
here
through
walls
ceiling
floor
repulsive
she
cried
plaintively
silence
she
glanced
once
more
at
the
king
plasmoid
against
the
wall
it
stayed
silent
too
and
it
was
as
if
the
two
silences
cancelled
each
other
out
she
remembered
the
last
feeling
of
moving
downward
and
lifted
the
suit
toward
a
passage
that
came
in
through
the
ceiling
she
hung
before
it
considering
far
up
and
back
in
its
darkness
a
bright
light
suddenly
blazed
vanished
and
blazed
again
something
was
coming
down
the
passage
fast
her
hand
started
for
the
gun
handle
then
it
remembered
another
drill
and
flashed
to
the
suit
communicator
a
voice
crashed
in
around
her
trigger
trigger
trigger
it
sobbed
ape
she
screamed
you
are
hurt
mantelish
garden
in
the
highland
south
of
ceyce
had
a
certain
renown
all
over
the
hub
it
had
been
donated
to
the
professor
years
ago
by
the
populace
of
another
federation
world
that
populace
had
negligently
permitted
a
hideous
pestilence
of
some
kind
to
be
imported
and
had
been
saved
in
the
nick
of
time
by
the
appropriate
hastily
developed
and
forwarded
to
it
by
mantelish
in
return
a
lifetime
ambition
had
been
fulfilled
for
him
his
own
private
botanical
garden
plus
an
unlimited
fund
for
stocking
and
upkeep
to
one
side
of
the
big
garden
house
where
mantelish
stayed
whenever
he
found
the
time
to
go
puttering
around
among
his
specimens
stood
a
giant
sequoia
generally
reputed
to
be
the
oldest
living
thing
in
the
hub
outside
of
the
life
banks
it
was
certainly
extremely
old
even
for
a
sequoia
for
the
last
decade
there
had
been
considerable
talk
about
the
advisability
of
removing
it
before
it
collapsed
and
crushed
the
house
and
everyone
in
it
but
it
was
one
of
the
professor
great
favorites
and
so
far
he
had
vetoed
the
suggestion
elbows
propped
on
the
broad
white
balustrade
of
the
porch
before
her
bedroom
trigger
was
studying
the
sequoia
crown
with
a
pair
of
field
glasses
when
pilch
arrived
she
laid
the
glasses
down
and
invited
her
guest
to
pull
up
a
chair
and
help
her
admire
the
view
they
admired
the
view
for
a
little
in
silence
it
certainly
is
a
beautiful
place
pilch
said
then
she
glanced
down
at
professor
mantelish
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
from
the
house
dressed
in
a
pair
of
tanned
shorts
and
busily
grubbing
away
with
a
spade
around
some
new
sort
of
shrub
he
just
planted
and
smiled
i
took
the
first
opportunity
i
had
to
come
see
you
she
said
trigger
looked
at
her
and
laughed
i
thought
you
might
you
satisfied
with
the
reports
then
pilch
said
of
course
not
but
it
was
obvious
the
emergency
was
over
so
i
was
whisked
away
to
something
else
she
frowned
slightly
sometimes
she
admitted
the
service
keeps
me
the
least
bit
busier
than
i
prefer
to
be
so
now
it
been
six
months
i
would
have
come
in
for
another
interview
if
you
called
me
trigger
said
i
know
said
pilch
but
that
would
have
made
it
official
i
can
keep
this
visit
off
the
record
her
eyes
met
trigger
for
a
moment
and
i
have
a
feeling
i
will
also
of
course
i
not
pushing
for
any
answers
you
might
care
to
give
just
push
away
trigger
said
agreeably
well
we
got
the
commissioner
call
from
his
ship
a
worried
man
he
was
so
it
seems
now
that
we
had
one
of
the
old
galactics
around
for
a
while
when
did
you
first
find
out
about
it
on
the
morning
after
our
interview
right
after
i
got
up
how
trigger
laughed
i
watch
my
weight
when
i
noticed
i
turned
three
and
a
half
pounds
heavier
overnight
than
i
averaged
the
past
four
years
i
knew
all
right
pilch
smiled
faintly
you
were
alarmed
at
all
no
i
guess
i
been
prepared
just
enough
by
that
time
but
then
you
know
i
forgot
all
about
it
again
until
lyad
and
flam
opened
that
purse
and
he
was
inside
then
i
remembered
and
after
that
i
forget
again
no
of
course
pilch
slim
fingers
tapped
the
surface
of
the
table
between
them
she
said
then
paying
repulsive
the
highest
compliment
pilch
could
give
it
he
was
a
good
therapist
after
a
moment
she
added
i
had
a
talk
with
commissioner
tate
an
hour
or
so
ago
preparing
to
leave
maccadon
again
i
understand
that
right
he
been
organizing
that
big
exploration
trip
of
mantelish
the
past
couple
of
months
he
be
in
charge
of
it
when
they
take
off
you
not
going
along
pilch
asked
trigger
shook
her
head
not
this
time
ape
and
i
captain
quillan
and
i
that
is
i
heard
pilch
said
she
smiled
you
picked
a
good
one
on
the
second
try
quillan
all
right
trigger
agreed
if
you
watch
him
a
little
anyway
said
pilch
commissioner
tate
seems
to
be
just
the
least
bit
worried
about
you
still
trigger
put
a
finger
to
her
temple
and
made
a
small
circling
motion
a
bit
not
exactly
that
perhaps
but
it
seems
said
pilch
that
you
told
him
a
good
deal
about
the
history
of
the
old
galactics
including
what
ended
them
as
a
race
thousand
years
ago
trigger
face
clouded
a
little
yes
she
said
she
sat
silent
for
a
moment
well
i
got
that
from
repulsive
somewhere
along
the
line
she
said
then
it
did
really
come
clear
until
some
time
after
we
got
back
but
it
was
there
in
those
pictures
in
the
interview
the
giants
stamping
on
the
farm
trigger
nodded
and
the
fast
clock
and
the
slow
one
he
was
trying
to
tell
it
then
the
jesters
that
the
giants
they
fast
and
tough
like
us
apparently
trigger
said
thoughtfully
they
a
good
deal
like
us
in
a
lot
of
ways
but
worse
much
worse
and
the
old
galactics
were
just
slow
they
thought
slow
they
moved
slow
they
did
almost
everything
slow
at
full
gallop
old
repulsive
could
have
kept
up
with
a
healthy
snail
besides
they
just
liked
to
grow
things
and
tinker
with
things
and
so
on
they
did
go
in
for
fighting
and
they
never
got
to
be
at
all
good
at
it
so
they
just
got
wiped
out
practically
the
jesters
were
good
at
fighting
eh
trigger
nodded
very
good
like
us
again
where
did
they
come
from
repulsive
thought
they
were
outsiders
he
was
sure
he
and
that
other
were
on
the
sidelines
running
their
protein
collecting
station
when
the
jesters
arrived
and
it
was
all
over
and
they
were
gone
before
he
had
learned
much
about
it
from
outside
the
galaxy
pilch
said
thoughtfully
she
cleared
her
throat
what
this
business
about
they
might
be
back
again
well
trigger
said
he
thought
they
might
be
just
might
actually
he
believed
the
jesters
got
wiped
out
too
eh
pilch
said
how
that
quite
a
lot
of
the
old
galactics
went
along
with
them
like
repulsive
went
along
with
me
and
one
of
the
things
they
did
know
trigger
said
was
how
to
spread
diseases
like
nobody
business
about
like
we
use
wholesale
they
could
clean
out
the
average
planet
of
any
particular
thing
they
did
want
there
in
about
a
week
so
it
not
really
too
likely
the
jesters
will
be
back
oh
said
pilch
but
if
they
are
coming
repulsive
thought
they
be
due
in
this
area
in
about
another
eight
centuries
that
looked
like
a
very
short
time
to
him
of
course
he
thought
it
would
be
best
to
pass
on
a
warning
you
know
pilch
said
after
a
brief
pause
i
find
myself
agreeing
with
him
there
trigger
i
might
turn
in
a
short
report
on
this
after
all
i
think
you
should
really
trigger
said
she
smiled
suddenly
of
course
it
might
wind
up
with
people
thinking
both
of
us
are
i
risk
that
said
pilch
it
been
thought
of
me
before
if
they
did
come
trigger
said
i
guess
we
take
them
anyway
taken
everything
else
like
that
that
came
long
and
besides
her
voice
trailed
off
thoughtfully
she
studied
the
table
top
for
a
moment
then
she
looked
up
at
pilch
well
she
said
smiling
any
other
questions
a
few
said
pilch
passing
up
the
and
besides
she
considered
did
you
ever
actually
see
him
make
contact
with
you
no
trigger
said
i
was
always
asleep
and
i
suppose
he
made
sure
stay
asleep
they
built
sort
of
like
a
leech
you
know
i
guess
he
knew
i
would
feel
comfortable
about
having
something
like
that
go
oozing
into
the
side
of
my
neck
or
start
oozing
out
again
anyway
he
never
did
let
me
see
it
considerate
little
fellow
said
pilch
she
sighed
well
everything
came
out
very
satisfactorily
much
more
so
than
anyone
could
have
dared
hope
at
one
time
all
that
left
is
a
very
intriguing
mystery
which
the
hub
will
be
chatting
about
for
years
what
happened
aboard
doctor
fayle
vanished
ship
that
caused
the
king
plasmoid
to
awaken
to
awful
life
she
cried
what
equally
mysterious
event
brought
about
its
death
on
that
strangely
hideous
structure
it
had
built
in
subspace
was
it
planning
to
do
there
etcetera
she
smiled
at
trigger
yes
very
good
i
saw
they
camouflaged
out
what
was
still
visible
of
the
original
substation
before
they
let
in
the
news
viewers
trigger
remarked
bright
idea
somebody
had
there
yes
it
was
i
and
the
devagas
hierarchy
is
broken
and
the
ermetynes
run
out
of
tranest
two
very
bad
spots
those
were
i
do
recall
having
heard
what
they
did
to
your
friend
pluly
heard
trigger
said
he
just
got
by
grand
commerce
finally
and
lost
all
his
shipping
concessions
however
his
daughter
is
married
to
an
up
and
coming
young
businessman
who
happened
to
be
on
hand
and
have
the
money
and
other
qualifications
to
pick
up
those
concessions
she
laughed
it
the
inger
lines
now
they
smart
characters
in
a
way
yes
said
pilch
in
a
way
did
you
know
lyad
ermetyne
put
in
for
voluntary
rehabilitation
with
us
and
then
changed
her
mind
and
joined
the
service
i
heard
of
it
trigger
hesitated
did
you
know
lyad
paid
me
a
short
visit
about
an
hour
before
you
got
here
this
morning
i
thought
she
would
pilch
said
we
came
in
to
maccadon
together
trigger
had
been
a
little
startled
when
she
answered
the
doorchime
and
saw
lyad
standing
there
she
invited
the
ermetyne
in
i
thought
i
thank
you
personally
lyad
said
casually
for
a
recording
which
was
delivered
to
me
some
months
ago
that
quite
all
right
trigger
said
also
casually
i
was
sure
i
was
going
to
have
any
use
for
it
lyad
studied
her
face
for
a
moment
to
be
honest
about
it
trigger
argee
she
said
i
still
do
feel
entirely
cordial
toward
you
however
i
did
appreciate
the
gesture
of
letting
me
have
the
recording
so
i
decided
to
drop
by
to
tell
you
there
is
really
too
much
left
in
the
way
of
hard
feelings
on
my
part
they
shook
hands
restrainedly
and
the
ermetyne
sauntered
out
again
the
other
reason
she
came
here
pilch
said
is
to
take
care
of
the
financing
of
mantelish
expedition
i
did
know
that
trigger
said
surprised
it
her
way
of
making
amends
her
legitimate
hub
holdings
are
still
enormous
of
course
she
can
afford
it
well
trigger
said
that
one
thing
about
lyad
she
wholehearted
she
that
said
pilch
rarely
have
i
seen
anyone
rip
into
total
therapy
with
the
verve
displayed
by
the
ermetyne
she
mentioned
on
one
occasion
that
there
simply
had
to
be
some
way
of
getting
ahead
of
you
again
oh
said
trigger
yes
said
pilch
by
the
way
what
are
your
own
plans
nowadays
aside
from
getting
married
trigger
stretched
slim
tanned
arms
over
her
head
and
grinned
no
immediate
plans
she
said
i
resigned
from
precol
got
a
couple
of
checks
from
the
federation
one
to
cover
my
expenses
on
that
plasmoid
business
that
was
the
dawn
city
fare
mainly
and
the
other
for
the
five
weeks
special
duty
they
figured
i
was
on
for
them
so
i
up
to
five
thousand
crowns
again
and
i
thought
i
just
loaf
around
and
sort
of
think
things
over
till
quillan
gets
back
from
his
current
assignment
i
see
when
is
major
quillan
returning
in
about
a
month
it
captain
quillan
at
present
by
the
way
oh
said
pilch
what
happened
that
unwarranted
interference
with
a
political
situation
business
they
broadcast
a
warning
against
taking
individual
action
of
any
kind
against
the
plasmoid
station
but
when
he
got
there
and
heard
the
commissioner
was
in
a
kind
of
coma
and
i
was
even
on
board
he
lost
his
head
and
came
charging
into
the
station
after
me
flinging
grenades
and
so
on
around
the
plasmoids
would
have
finished
him
off
pretty
quick
except
most
of
them
had
started
slowing
down
as
soon
as
repulsive
turned
off
the
main
one
the
lunatic
was
lucky
the
termites
did
get
to
him
before
he
even
reached
the
station
pilch
said
termites
trigger
told
her
about
the
termites
ugh
said
pilch
i
had
heard
about
those
so
they
broke
him
for
that
it
hardly
seems
right
well
you
have
to
have
discipline
trigger
said
tolerantly
ape
a
bit
short
on
that
end
anyway
they
be
upgrading
him
again
fairly
soon
i
imagine
i
might
just
be
going
into
space
scout
intelligence
myself
by
the
way
they
said
they
be
glad
to
have
me
not
at
all
incidentally
remarked
pilch
my
service
also
would
be
glad
to
have
you
would
they
trigger
looked
at
her
thoughtfully
that
includes
that
total
therapy
process
does
it
usually
said
pilch
well
i
might
some
day
but
not
just
yet
she
smiled
let
let
lyad
get
a
head
start
actually
it
just
i
found
out
there
are
so
many
interesting
things
going
on
all
around
that
i
like
to
look
them
over
a
bit
before
i
go
charging
seriously
into
a
career
again
she
reached
across
the
table
and
tapped
pilch
wrist
and
i
show
you
one
interesting
thing
that
going
on
right
here
take
mantelish
big
tree
out
there
the
sequoia
yes
now
just
last
year
it
was
looking
so
bad
they
almost
talked
the
professor
into
having
it
taken
away
hardly
a
green
branch
left
on
it
pilch
shaded
her
eyes
and
looked
at
the
sequoia
crown
far
above
them
it
looks
she
observed
reflectively
in
fairly
good
shape
at
the
moment
i
say
yes
and
it
getting
greener
every
week
mantelish
brags
about
a
new
solvent
he
been
dosing
its
roots
with
you
see
that
great
big
branch
like
an
l
turned
upward
just
a
little
above
the
center
pilch
looked
again
yes
she
said
after
a
moment
i
think
so
just
before
the
l
turns
upward
there
a
little
cluster
of
green
branches
trigger
said
i
see
those
yes
trigger
picked
up
the
field
glasses
and
handed
them
to
her
get
those
little
branches
in
the
glasses
she
said
pilch
said
presently
got
them
trigger
stood
up
and
faced
up
to
the
sequoia
she
cupped
her
hands
to
her
mouth
took
a
deep
breath
and
yelled
down
in
the
garden
mantelish
straightened
and
looked
about
angrily
then
he
saw
trigger
and
smiled
yourself
trigger
he
shouted
and
turned
back
to
his
spading
trigger
watched
pilch
face
from
the
side
she
saw
her
give
a
sudden
start
great
galaxies
pilch
breathed
she
kept
on
looking
that
one
for
the
book
is
it
finally
she
put
the
glasses
down
she
appeared
somewhat
stunned
he
really
is
a
little
green
man
only
when
he
trying
to
be
it
a
sort
of
sign
of
friendliness
what
he
doing
up
there
he
moved
over
into
the
sequoia
right
after
we
got
back
trigger
said
and
that
where
he
probably
stay
indefinitely
now
it
just
the
right
kind
of
place
for
repulsive
have
you
been
doing
any
more
well
talking
no
too
strenuous
both
ways
until
a
few
days
before
we
got
back
here
there
was
even
a
sign
from
him
he
just
about
knocked
himself
out
on
that
big
plasmoid
who
else
knows
about
this
asked
pilch
nobody
i
would
have
told
holati
except
he
still
mad
enough
about
having
been
put
into
a
coma
he
might
go
out
and
chop
the
sequoia
down
well
it
wo
go
into
the
report
then
pilch
said
they
just
want
to
bother
repulsive
i
knew
it
would
be
all
right
to
tell
you
and
here
something
else
very
interesting
that
going
on
at
present
what
that
the
real
reason
for
mantelish
expedition
trigger
explained
is
of
course
to
scout
around
this
whole
area
of
space
with
planetary
plasmoid
detectors
they
do
want
anybody
stumbling
on
another
setup
like
harvest
moon
and
accidentally
activating
another
king
plasmoid
yes
pilch
said
i
heard
that
it
was
mantelish
idea
said
trigger
now
mantelish
is
very
fond
of
that
sequoia
tree
he
got
a
big
comfortable
bench
right
among
its
roots
where
he
likes
to
sit
down
around
noon
and
have
a
little
nap
when
he
out
here
oh
said
pilch
repulsive
been
up
to
his
old
tricks
eh
sure
he
given
mantelish
very
exact
instructions
so
they
going
to
find
one
of
those
setups
all
right
and
they
wo
come
back
with
any
plasmoids
but
they
will
come
back
with
something
they
do
know
about
pilch
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
say
it
trigger
grin
widened
a
little
green
woman
she
said
consider
the
plasmoids
ancient
living
machines
that
after
millennia
of
stillness
suddenly
begin
to
move
under
their
own
power
for
reasons
that
remain
a
mystery
to
men
holati
tate
discovered
them
then
disappeared
trigger
argee
was
his
closest
associate
she
means
to
find
him
she
brilliant
beautiful
and
skilled
in
every
known
martial
art
she
worth
plenty
dead
or
alive
to
more
than
one
faction
in
this
obscure
battle
and
beginning
to
have
a
chilling
notion
that
the
masters
of
the
old
galaxy
were
wise
when
they
exiled
the
plasmoids
to
the
most
distant
and
isolated
world
