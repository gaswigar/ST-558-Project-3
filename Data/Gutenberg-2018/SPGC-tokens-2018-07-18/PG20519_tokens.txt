my
drinking
uncle
don
and
of
course
in
the
founding
days
of
rhine
institute
the
need
arose
for
a
new
punctuation
mark
which
would
indicate
on
the
printed
page
that
the
passage
was
of
mental
origin
just
as
the
familiar
quotation
marks
indicate
that
the
words
between
them
were
of
verbal
origin
accordingly
the
symbol
was
chosen
primarily
because
it
appears
on
every
typewriter
up
to
the
present
time
the
use
of
the
symbol
to
indicate
directed
mental
communication
has
been
restricted
to
technical
papers
term
theses
and
scholarly
treatises
by
professors
scholars
and
students
of
telepathy
here
for
the
first
time
in
any
popular
work
the
symbol
is
used
to
signify
that
the
passage
between
the
marks
was
mental
communication
steve
cornell
stalemate
macklin
said
please
put
that
weapon
down
cornell
let
not
add
attempted
murder
to
your
other
crimes
do
force
me
to
it
then
i
told
him
but
i
knew
i
could
do
it
i
hated
them
all
i
wanted
the
whole
highways
in
hiding
rolled
up
like
an
old
discarded
carpet
with
every
mekstrom
on
earth
rolled
up
in
it
but
i
could
pull
the
trigger
the
survivors
would
have
enough
savvy
to
clean
up
the
mess
before
our
bodies
got
cold
and
the
highways
crowd
would
be
doing
business
at
the
same
old
stand
without
i
might
add
the
minor
nuisance
that
people
call
steve
cornell
what
i
really
wanted
was
to
find
catherine
and
then
it
came
to
me
that
what
i
really
wanted
second
of
all
was
to
possess
a
body
of
mekstrom
flesh
to
be
a
physical
superman
i
i
came
up
out
of
the
blackness
just
enough
to
know
that
i
was
no
longer
pinned
down
by
a
couple
of
tons
of
wrecked
automobile
i
floated
on
soft
sheets
with
only
a
light
blanket
over
me
i
hurt
all
over
like
a
hundred
and
sixty
pounds
of
boil
my
right
arm
was
numb
and
my
left
thigh
was
aching
breathing
felt
like
being
stabbed
with
rapiers
and
the
skin
of
my
face
felt
stretched
tight
there
was
a
bandage
over
my
eyes
and
the
place
was
as
quiet
as
the
grave
but
i
knew
that
i
was
not
in
any
grave
because
my
nose
was
working
just
barely
well
enough
to
register
the
unmistakable
pungent
odor
that
only
goes
with
hospitals
i
tried
my
sense
of
perception
but
like
any
delicate
and
critical
sense
perception
was
one
of
the
first
to
go
i
could
not
dig
out
beyond
a
few
inches
i
could
sense
the
bed
and
the
white
sheets
and
that
was
all
some
brave
soul
had
hauled
me
out
of
that
before
the
fuel
tank
went
up
in
the
fire
i
hope
that
whoever
he
was
he
had
enough
sense
to
haul
catherine
out
of
the
mess
first
the
thought
of
living
without
catherine
was
too
dark
to
bear
and
so
i
just
let
the
blackness
close
down
over
me
again
because
it
cut
out
all
pain
both
physical
and
mental
the
next
time
i
awoke
there
was
light
and
a
pleasant
male
voice
saying
steve
cornell
steve
can
you
hear
me
i
tried
to
answer
but
no
sound
came
out
not
even
a
hoarse
croak
the
voice
went
on
do
try
to
talk
steve
just
think
it
catherine
i
thought
sharply
because
most
medicos
are
telepath
not
perceptive
catherine
is
all
right
he
replied
can
i
see
her
lord
no
he
said
quickly
you
scare
her
half
to
death
the
way
you
look
right
now
how
bad
off
am
i
you
a
mess
steve
broken
ribs
compound
fracture
of
the
left
tibia
broken
humerus
scars
mars
abrasions
some
flashburn
and
shock
and
if
you
interested
not
a
trace
of
mekstrom
disease
mekstrom
disease
was
my
thought
of
horror
forget
it
steve
i
always
check
for
it
because
it
been
my
specialty
do
worry
okay
so
how
long
have
i
been
here
eight
days
eight
days
could
you
do
the
usual
job
you
were
pretty
badly
ground
up
steve
that
what
took
the
time
now
suppose
you
tell
me
what
happened
catherine
and
i
were
eloping
just
like
most
other
couples
do
since
rhine
institute
made
it
difficult
to
find
personal
privacy
then
we
cracked
what
did
it
asked
the
doctor
perceptives
like
you
usually
sense
danger
before
you
can
see
it
catherine
called
my
attention
to
a
peculiar
road
sign
and
i
sent
my
perception
back
to
take
another
dig
we
hit
the
fallen
limb
of
a
tree
and
went
over
and
over
you
know
the
bad
said
the
doctor
but
what
kind
of
a
sign
would
call
your
interest
so
deep
that
you
did
at
least
see
the
limb
even
if
you
were
perceiving
the
sign
peculiar
sign
i
thought
ornamental
wrought
iron
gizmo
with
curlicues
and
a
little
decorative
circle
that
sort
of
looks
like
the
boy
scout
tenderfoot
badge
suspended
on
three
spokes
one
of
the
spokes
were
broken
away
i
got
involved
because
i
was
trying
to
guess
whether
it
had
been
shot
away
by
some
vandal
who
missed
the
central
design
then
blooie
it
really
too
bad
steve
but
you
be
all
right
in
a
while
thanks
doctor
doctor
doctor
sorry
steve
i
forget
that
everybody
is
not
telepath
like
i
am
james
thorndyke
much
later
i
began
to
wake
up
again
and
with
better
clarity
of
mind
i
found
that
i
could
extend
my
esper
as
far
as
the
wall
and
through
the
door
by
a
few
inches
it
was
strictly
hospital
all
right
sere
white
and
stainless
steel
as
far
as
my
esper
could
reach
in
my
room
was
a
nurse
rustling
in
starched
white
i
tried
to
speak
croaked
once
and
then
paused
to
form
my
voice
can
i
see
how
is
where
is
i
stopped
again
because
the
nurse
was
probably
as
esper
as
i
was
and
required
a
full
sentence
to
get
the
thought
behind
it
only
a
telepath
like
the
doctor
could
have
followed
my
jumbled
ideas
but
the
nurse
was
good
she
tried
cornell
you
awake
look
nurse
take
it
easy
i
miss
farrow
i
get
the
doctor
no
wait
i
been
here
eight
days
but
you
were
badly
hurt
you
know
but
the
doctor
he
said
that
she
was
here
too
do
worry
about
it
mr
cornell
but
he
said
that
she
was
not
badly
hurt
she
was
then
why
was
is
she
here
so
long
miss
farrow
laughed
cheerfully
your
christine
is
in
fine
shape
she
is
still
here
because
she
would
leave
until
you
were
well
out
of
danger
now
stop
fretting
you
see
her
soon
enough
her
laugh
was
light
but
strained
it
sounded
because
it
was
as
as
a
of
baldfaced
perjury
she
left
in
a
hurry
and
i
was
able
to
esper
as
far
as
outside
the
door
where
she
leaned
back
against
the
wood
and
began
to
cry
she
was
hating
herself
because
she
had
blown
her
lines
and
she
knew
that
i
knew
it
and
catherine
had
never
been
in
this
hospital
because
if
she
had
been
brought
in
with
me
the
nurse
would
have
known
the
right
name
not
that
it
mattered
to
me
now
but
miss
farrow
was
no
esper
or
have
dug
my
belongings
and
found
catherine
name
on
the
license
miss
farrow
was
a
telepath
i
not
called
my
girl
by
name
only
by
an
affectionate
mental
image
ii
i
was
fighting
my
body
upright
when
doctor
thorndyke
came
running
easy
steve
he
said
with
a
quiet
gesture
he
pushed
me
gently
back
down
in
the
bed
with
hands
that
were
as
soft
as
a
mother
but
as
firm
as
the
kind
that
tie
bow
knots
in
bars
easy
he
repeated
soothingly
catherine
i
croaked
pleadingly
thorndyke
fingered
the
call
button
in
some
code
or
other
before
he
answered
me
steve
he
said
honestly
you
ca
be
kept
in
ignorance
forever
we
hoped
it
would
be
a
little
longer
when
you
were
stronger
stop
beating
around
i
yelled
at
least
it
felt
like
i
was
yelling
but
maybe
it
was
only
my
mind
welling
easy
steve
you
had
a
rough
time
shock
the
door
opened
and
a
nurse
came
in
with
a
hypo
all
loaded
its
needle
buried
in
a
fluff
of
cotton
thorndyke
eyed
it
professionally
and
took
it
the
nurse
faded
quietly
from
the
room
take
it
easy
steve
this
will
no
not
until
i
know
easy
he
repeated
he
held
the
needle
up
before
my
eyes
steve
he
said
i
do
know
whether
you
have
enough
esper
training
to
dig
the
contents
of
this
needle
but
if
you
have
will
you
please
trust
me
this
contains
a
neurohypnotic
it
wo
put
you
under
it
will
leave
you
as
wide
awake
as
you
are
now
but
it
will
disconnect
your
running
gear
and
keep
you
from
blowing
a
fuse
then
with
swift
deftness
that
amazed
me
the
doctor
slid
the
needle
into
my
arm
and
let
me
have
the
full
load
i
was
feeling
the
excitement
rise
in
me
because
something
was
wrong
but
i
could
also
feel
the
stuff
going
to
work
within
half
a
minute
i
was
in
a
frame
of
mind
that
was
capable
of
recognizing
the
facts
but
not
caring
much
one
way
or
the
other
when
he
saw
the
stuff
taking
hold
thorndyke
asked
steve
just
who
is
catherine
the
shock
almost
cut
through
the
drug
my
mind
whirled
with
all
the
things
that
catherine
was
to
me
and
the
doctor
followed
it
every
bit
of
the
way
steve
you
been
under
an
accident
shock
there
was
no
catherine
with
you
there
was
no
one
with
you
at
all
understand
that
and
accept
it
no
one
you
were
alone
do
you
understand
i
shook
my
head
i
sounded
to
myself
like
an
actor
reading
the
script
of
a
play
for
the
first
time
i
wanted
to
pound
on
the
table
and
add
the
vigor
of
physical
violence
to
my
hoarse
voice
but
all
i
could
do
was
to
reply
in
a
calm
voice
catherine
was
with
me
we
were
i
let
it
trail
off
because
thorndyke
knew
very
well
what
we
were
doing
we
were
eloping
in
the
new
definition
of
the
word
rhine
institute
and
its
associated
studies
had
changed
a
lot
of
customs
a
couple
intending
to
commit
matrimony
today
were
inclined
to
take
off
quietly
and
disappear
from
their
usual
haunts
until
they
managed
to
get
intimately
acquainted
with
one
another
elopement
was
a
means
of
finding
some
personal
privacy
we
should
have
stayed
at
home
and
faced
the
crude
jokes
that
changed
since
pithecanthropus
first
discovered
that
sex
was
funny
but
our
mutual
desire
to
find
some
privacy
in
this
modern
had
put
me
in
the
hospital
and
catherine
where
steve
listen
to
me
yeah
i
know
you
espers
you
sensitive
maybe
more
so
than
telepaths
more
imagination
this
was
for
the
birds
in
my
estimation
among
the
customs
that
rhine
has
changed
was
the
old
argument
as
to
whether
women
or
men
were
smarter
now
the
big
argument
was
whether
espers
or
telepaths
could
get
along
better
with
the
rest
of
the
world
thorndyke
laughed
at
my
objections
and
went
on
you
in
accident
shock
you
piled
up
your
car
you
begin
to
imagine
how
terrible
it
would
have
been
if
your
catherine
had
been
with
you
next
you
carefully
build
up
in
your
subconscious
mind
a
whole
and
complete
story
so
well
put
together
that
to
you
it
seems
to
be
fact
but
how
could
anyone
have
taken
a
look
at
the
scene
of
the
accident
and
not
seen
traces
of
woman
my
we
looked
he
said
in
answer
to
my
unspoken
question
there
was
not
a
trace
steve
fingerprints
you
been
dating
her
naturally
thorndyke
nodded
quietly
there
were
a
lot
of
her
prints
on
the
remains
of
your
car
but
no
one
could
begin
to
put
a
date
on
them
or
tell
how
recent
was
the
latest
due
to
the
fire
then
we
made
a
door
to
door
canvas
of
the
neighborhood
to
be
sure
she
had
wandered
off
in
a
daze
and
shock
not
even
a
footprint
nary
a
trace
he
shook
his
head
unhappily
i
suppose
you
going
to
ask
about
that
travelling
bag
you
claim
to
have
put
in
the
trunk
beside
your
own
there
was
no
trace
of
any
travelling
bag
doctor
i
asked
pointedly
if
we
were
together
suppose
you
tell
me
first
why
i
had
a
marriage
license
in
my
pocket
second
how
come
i
made
a
date
with
the
reverend
towle
in
midtown
and
third
why
did
i
bother
to
reserve
the
bridal
suite
in
the
reignoir
hotel
in
westlake
or
was
i
nuts
a
long
time
before
this
accident
maybe
i
added
after
making
reservations
i
had
to
go
out
and
pile
myself
up
as
an
excuse
for
not
turning
up
with
a
bride
i
all
i
can
say
is
that
there
was
not
a
trace
of
woman
in
that
accident
you
been
digging
in
my
mind
did
you
dig
her
telephone
number
he
looked
at
me
blankly
and
you
found
what
when
you
tried
to
call
her
i
er
her
landlady
told
you
that
miss
lewis
was
not
in
her
apartment
because
miss
lewis
was
on
her
honeymoon
operating
under
the
name
of
steve
cornell
that
about
it
all
right
so
now
you
know
then
where
the
hell
is
she
doc
the
drug
was
not
as
as
it
had
been
and
i
was
beginning
to
feel
excitement
again
we
do
know
steve
how
about
the
guy
that
hauled
me
out
of
that
wreck
what
does
he
say
he
was
there
when
we
arrived
the
car
had
been
hauled
off
you
by
block
and
tackle
by
the
time
we
got
there
the
tackle
had
been
burned
and
the
car
was
back
down
again
in
a
crumpled
mass
he
is
a
farmer
by
the
name
of
harrison
he
had
one
of
his
older
sons
with
him
a
man
about
named
phillip
they
both
swore
later
that
there
was
no
woman
in
that
car
nor
a
trace
of
one
oh
he
did
did
he
thorndyke
shook
his
head
slowly
and
then
said
very
gently
steve
there
no
predicting
what
a
man
mind
will
do
in
a
case
of
shock
seen
come
up
with
a
completely
false
identity
all
the
way
back
to
childhood
now
let
take
your
case
once
more
among
the
other
incredible
items
incredible
i
roared
easy
hear
me
out
after
all
am
i
to
believe
your
unsubstantiated
story
or
the
evidence
of
a
whole
raft
of
witnesses
the
police
detail
the
accident
squad
and
the
guys
who
hauled
you
out
of
a
burning
car
before
it
blew
up
as
i
was
saying
how
can
we
credit
much
of
your
tale
when
you
raved
about
one
man
lifting
the
car
and
the
other
hauling
you
out
from
underneath
i
shrugged
that
obviously
a
mistaken
impression
no
one
could
so
when
you
admit
that
one
hunk
of
your
story
is
mistaken
that
does
prove
the
rest
is
false
the
police
have
been
tracking
this
affair
hard
said
the
doctor
slowly
they
gotten
nowhere
tell
me
did
anyone
see
you
leave
that
apartment
with
miss
lewis
no
i
said
slowly
no
one
that
knew
us
thorndyke
shook
his
head
unhappily
that
why
we
have
to
assume
that
you
are
in
shock
i
snorted
angrily
then
explain
the
license
the
date
with
the
reverend
the
hotel
reservation
thorndyke
said
quietly
hear
me
out
steve
this
is
not
my
own
idea
alone
but
the
combined
ideas
of
a
number
of
people
who
have
studied
the
human
mind
in
other
words
i
nuts
no
shock
shock
he
nodded
very
slowly
let
put
it
this
way
let
assume
that
you
wanted
this
marriage
with
miss
lewis
you
made
preparations
furnished
an
apartment
got
a
license
made
a
date
with
a
preacher
reserved
a
honeymoon
suite
and
bought
flowers
for
the
bride
you
take
off
from
work
arrive
at
her
door
only
to
find
that
miss
lewis
has
taken
off
for
parts
unknown
maybe
she
left
you
a
letter
letter
hear
me
out
steve
you
arrive
at
her
apartment
and
find
her
gone
you
read
a
letter
from
her
saying
that
she
can
not
marry
you
this
is
a
rather
deep
shock
to
you
and
you
ca
face
it
know
what
happens
i
blow
my
brains
out
along
a
country
road
at
ninety
miles
per
hour
please
this
is
serious
it
sounds
incredibly
stupid
to
me
you
rejecting
it
in
the
same
way
you
rejected
the
fact
that
miss
lewis
ran
away
rather
than
marry
you
do
go
on
doctor
you
drive
along
the
same
road
you
planned
to
take
but
the
frustration
and
shock
pile
up
to
put
you
in
an
frame
of
mind
you
then
pile
up
not
consciously
but
as
soon
as
you
come
upon
something
like
that
tree
limb
which
can
be
used
to
make
an
accident
authentic
oh
sure
thorndyke
eyed
me
soberly
steve
he
asked
me
in
a
brittle
voice
you
wo
try
to
convince
me
that
any
esper
will
let
physical
danger
of
that
sort
get
close
enough
to
i
told
you
how
it
happened
my
attention
was
on
that
busted
sign
fine
more
evidence
to
the
fact
that
miss
lewis
was
with
you
now
listen
to
me
in
you
not
remember
anything
that
your
mind
did
want
you
to
recall
failure
is
a
hard
thing
to
take
so
now
you
can
blame
your
misfortune
on
that
accident
so
now
you
tell
me
how
you
justify
the
fact
that
catherine
told
landladies
friends
bosses
and
all
the
rest
that
she
was
going
to
marry
me
a
good
long
time
before
i
was
ready
to
be
verbal
about
my
plans
i
suppose
i
succeeded
in
bribing
everybody
to
perjure
themselves
maybe
we
all
had
it
in
for
catherine
and
did
her
in
thorndyke
shrugged
i
do
know
he
said
i
really
do
know
steve
i
wish
i
did
that
makes
two
of
us
i
grunted
has
anybody
thought
of
arresting
me
for
kidnapping
suspicion
of
murder
reckless
driving
and
cluttering
up
the
highway
with
junk
yes
he
said
quietly
the
police
were
most
thorough
they
had
two
of
their
top
men
look
into
you
what
did
they
find
i
asked
angrily
no
man
likes
to
have
his
mind
turned
inside
out
and
laid
out
flat
so
that
all
the
little
wheels
cables
and
levers
are
open
to
the
public
gaze
on
the
other
hand
since
i
was
not
only
innocent
of
any
crime
but
as
baffled
as
the
rest
of
them
i
have
gone
to
them
willingly
to
let
them
dig
to
see
if
they
could
dig
past
my
conscious
mind
into
the
real
truth
they
found
that
your
story
was
substantially
an
honest
one
then
why
all
this
balderdash
about
shock
rejection
and
so
on
he
shook
his
head
none
of
us
are
supermen
he
said
simply
your
story
was
honest
you
were
lying
you
believe
every
word
of
it
you
saw
it
you
went
through
it
that
does
prove
your
story
true
now
see
here
it
does
prove
one
thing
that
you
steve
cornell
did
not
have
any
malicious
premeditated
plans
against
catherine
lewis
they
checked
everything
from
hell
to
breakfast
and
so
far
all
we
can
do
is
make
guesses
as
to
what
happened
i
snorted
in
my
disgust
that
a
telepath
for
you
everything
so
neatly
laid
out
in
rows
of
slats
like
a
snow
fence
me
i
going
to
consult
a
scholar
and
have
him
really
dig
me
deep
thorndyke
shook
his
head
they
had
their
top
men
steve
scholar
redfern
and
scholar
berks
both
of
them
rhine
scholars
cum
i
blinked
as
i
always
do
when
i
am
flabbergasted
i
known
a
lot
of
doctors
of
this
and
that
from
medicine
to
languages
i
even
known
a
scholar
or
two
but
none
of
them
intimately
but
when
a
doctor
of
psi
is
invited
to
take
his
scholarte
at
rhine
that
it
brother
i
pass
thorndyke
smiled
you
were
too
bad
yourself
steve
ran
twelfth
in
your
class
at
illinois
did
you
i
nodded
glumly
i
forgot
to
cover
the
facts
they
called
all
the
bright
boys
out
and
collected
them
under
one
roof
i
majored
in
mechanical
ingenuity
not
psi
hoped
to
get
a
ing
out
of
it
at
least
but
had
to
stop
partly
because
i
not
ingenious
enough
and
partly
because
i
ran
out
of
cash
doctor
thorndyke
nodded
i
know
how
it
is
he
said
i
realized
that
he
was
leading
me
away
from
the
main
subject
gently
but
i
could
see
how
to
lead
him
back
without
starting
another
verbal
hassle
he
had
me
cold
he
could
dig
my
mind
and
get
the
best
way
to
lead
me
away
while
i
could
read
his
i
gave
up
it
felt
better
too
getting
my
mind
off
this
completely
baffling
puzzle
even
for
a
moment
he
caught
my
thoughts
but
his
face
did
twitch
a
bit
as
he
picked
up
his
narrative
smoothly
i
did
make
it
either
he
said
unhappily
i
psi
and
good
but
telepath
and
not
esper
i
weasled
my
way
through
and
medical
by
main
force
and
awkwardness
so
to
speak
he
grinned
at
me
sheepishly
i
not
much
different
than
you
or
any
other
psi
the
espers
all
think
that
perception
is
superior
to
the
ability
to
read
minds
and
vice
versa
i
was
going
to
show
that
a
telepath
can
make
scholar
of
medicine
so
i
my
way
through
med
by
reading
the
minds
of
my
fellows
who
were
all
good
espers
i
got
so
good
that
i
could
read
the
mind
of
an
esper
watching
me
do
a
delicate
dissecting
job
and
move
my
hands
according
to
his
perception
i
could
diagnose
the
deep
ills
with
the
best
of
them
so
long
as
there
was
an
esper
in
the
place
so
what
tripped
you
up
telepaths
make
out
best
dealing
with
people
espers
do
better
with
things
is
medicine
a
field
that
deals
with
people
he
shook
his
head
not
when
a
headache
means
spinal
tumor
or
indigestion
or
a
bad
cold
says
the
patient
a
bad
ache
along
my
left
side
just
below
the
ribs
and
after
you
diagnose
it
turns
out
to
be
acute
appendicitis
you
see
steve
the
patient
know
what
wrong
with
him
only
the
symptoms
a
telepath
can
follow
the
patient
symptoms
perfectly
but
it
takes
an
esper
to
dig
in
his
guts
and
perceive
the
tumor
that
pressing
on
the
spine
or
the
striae
on
his
liver
yeah
so
i
flopped
on
a
couple
of
tests
that
the
rest
of
the
class
sailed
through
just
because
i
was
not
fast
enough
to
read
their
minds
and
put
my
own
ability
to
work
it
made
suspicious
and
so
here
i
am
a
mere
doctor
instead
of
a
scholar
there
are
fields
for
you
i
sure
he
nodded
two
psychiatry
and
psychology
neither
of
which
i
have
any
love
for
and
medical
research
where
the
ability
to
grasp
another
doctor
or
scholar
plan
ideas
and
theories
is
slightly
more
important
than
the
ability
to
dig
esper
into
the
experiments
do
see
that
i
said
with
a
shake
of
my
head
well
steve
let
take
mekstrom
disease
for
instance
let
take
something
simple
what
i
know
about
mekstrom
disease
could
be
carved
on
the
head
of
a
pin
with
a
blunt
butter
knife
let
take
mekstrom
that
my
chance
to
make
scholar
of
medicine
steve
if
i
can
come
up
with
an
answer
to
one
of
the
minor
questions
i
be
in
the
clinical
laboratory
where
the
only
cases
present
are
those
rare
cases
of
mekstrom
the
other
doctors
espers
every
one
of
them
and
the
scholars
over
them
will
dig
the
man
body
right
down
to
the
last
cell
looking
and
combing
you
know
some
of
the
better
espers
can
actually
dig
into
the
constituency
of
a
cell
but
i
be
the
doctor
who
can
collect
all
their
information
correlate
it
and
maybe
come
up
with
an
answer
you
picked
a
dilly
i
told
him
it
was
a
real
one
all
right
otto
mekstrom
had
been
a
at
white
sands
space
station
during
the
first
flight
to
venus
mars
and
moon
with
landings
about
two
weeks
after
the
ship
came
home
otto
mekstrom
left
fingertips
began
to
grow
hard
the
hardening
crawled
up
slowly
until
his
hand
was
like
a
rock
they
studied
him
and
worked
over
him
and
took
all
sorts
of
samples
and
made
all
sorts
of
tests
until
otto
forearm
was
as
hard
as
his
hand
then
they
amputated
at
the
shoulder
but
by
that
time
otto
mekstrom
toes
on
both
feet
were
getting
solid
and
his
other
hand
was
beginning
to
show
signs
of
the
same
on
one
side
of
the
creepline
the
flesh
was
soft
and
normal
but
on
the
other
it
was
all
you
could
do
to
poke
a
sharp
needle
into
the
skin
poor
otto
ended
up
a
basket
case
just
in
time
to
have
the
damned
stuff
start
all
over
again
at
the
stumps
of
his
arms
and
legs
he
died
when
hardening
reached
his
vitals
since
that
day
some
years
ago
there
had
been
about
thirty
cases
a
year
turn
up
all
fatal
despite
amputations
and
everything
else
known
to
modern
medical
science
god
alone
knew
how
many
unfortunate
human
beings
took
to
suicide
without
contacting
the
big
medical
research
center
at
marion
indiana
well
if
thorndyke
could
uncover
something
no
one
could
claim
that
a
telepath
had
no
place
in
medicine
i
wished
him
luck
i
did
not
see
thorndyke
again
in
that
hospital
they
released
me
the
next
day
and
then
i
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
chew
my
fingernails
and
wonder
what
had
happened
to
catherine
iii
i
rather
not
go
into
the
next
week
and
a
half
in
detail
i
became
known
as
the
bridegroom
who
lost
his
bride
and
between
the
veiled
accusations
and
the
snickers
life
was
pretty
miserable
i
talked
to
the
police
a
times
first
as
a
citizen
asking
for
information
and
ending
up
as
a
complainant
against
party
or
parties
unknown
the
latter
got
me
nowhere
apparently
the
police
had
more
lines
out
than
the
grand
bank
fishing
fleet
and
were
getting
no
more
nibbles
than
they
get
in
the
dead
sea
they
admitted
it
the
day
had
gone
when
the
police
gave
out
news
reports
that
an
arrest
was
expected
hourly
meaning
that
they
were
baffled
the
police
with
their
fine
collection
of
psi
boys
were
willing
to
admit
when
they
were
really
baffled
i
talked
to
telepaths
who
could
tell
me
what
i
had
for
breakfast
on
the
day
i
entered
classes
and
espers
who
could
sense
the
color
of
the
clothing
i
wore
yesterday
i
a
poor
primitive
so
to
speak
these
guys
were
good
but
no
matter
how
good
they
were
catherine
lewis
had
vanished
as
neatly
as
ambrose
bierce
i
even
read
charles
fort
although
i
have
no
belief
in
the
supernatural
and
rather
faint
faith
in
the
hereafter
and
people
who
enter
the
hereafter
leave
their
remains
behind
for
evidence
having
to
face
catherine
mother
and
father
who
came
east
to
see
me
made
me
a
complete
mental
wreck
it
is
harder
than
you
think
to
face
the
parents
of
a
woman
you
loved
and
find
that
all
you
can
tell
them
is
that
somehow
you
fouled
your
drive
cracked
up
and
lost
their
daughter
not
even
death
i
think
we
all
could
have
faced
but
this
uncertainty
was
something
that
gnawed
at
the
soul
roots
and
left
it
rotting
to
stand
there
and
watch
the
tears
in
the
eyes
of
a
woman
as
she
asks
you
but
ca
you
remember
son
is
a
little
too
much
and
i
care
to
go
into
details
the
upshot
of
it
was
after
about
ten
days
of
lying
awake
nights
and
wondering
where
she
was
and
why
watching
her
eyes
peer
out
of
a
metal
casting
at
me
from
a
position
sidewise
of
my
head
nightmares
either
the
one
about
us
turning
over
and
over
and
over
or
lewis
pleading
with
me
only
to
tell
her
the
truth
then
having
the
police
inform
me
that
they
were
marking
this
case
down
as
unexplained
i
gave
up
i
finally
swore
that
i
was
going
to
find
her
and
return
with
her
or
i
was
going
to
join
her
in
whatever
strange
unknown
world
she
had
entered
the
first
thing
i
did
was
to
go
back
to
the
hospital
in
the
hope
that
thorndyke
might
be
able
to
add
something
in
my
unconscious
ramblings
there
might
be
something
that
fell
into
a
pattern
if
it
could
be
pieced
together
but
this
was
a
failure
too
the
hospital
super
was
sorry
but
thorndyke
had
left
for
the
medical
research
center
a
couple
of
days
before
nor
could
i
get
in
touch
with
him
because
he
had
a
interim
vacation
and
planned
a
long
slow
jaunt
through
yellowstone
with
neither
schedule
nor
forwarding
addresses
i
was
standing
there
on
the
steps
hoping
to
wave
down
a
cruising
coptercab
when
the
door
opened
and
a
woman
came
out
i
turned
to
look
and
she
recognized
me
it
was
miss
farrow
my
former
nurse
why
cornell
what
are
you
doing
back
here
mostly
looking
for
thorndyke
he
not
here
i
know
is
it
wonderful
though
he
get
his
chance
to
study
for
his
scholarte
now
i
nodded
glumly
yeah
i
said
it
probably
sounded
resentful
but
it
is
hard
to
show
cheer
over
the
good
fortune
of
someone
else
when
your
own
world
has
come
unglued
still
hoping
she
said
it
was
a
statement
and
not
a
question
i
nodded
slowly
i
hoping
i
said
someone
has
the
answer
to
this
puzzle
i
have
to
find
it
myself
everyone
else
has
given
up
i
wish
you
luck
said
miss
farrow
with
a
smile
you
certainly
have
the
determination
i
grunted
it
about
all
i
have
what
i
need
is
training
here
i
am
a
mechanical
engineer
about
to
tackle
the
job
of
a
professional
detective
and
tracer
of
missing
persons
about
all
i
know
about
the
job
is
what
i
have
read
one
gets
the
idea
that
these
writers
must
know
something
of
the
job
the
way
they
write
about
it
but
once
you
faced
with
it
yourself
you
realize
that
the
writer
has
planted
his
own
clues
miss
farrow
nodded
one
thing
she
suggested
have
you
talked
to
the
people
who
got
you
out
from
under
your
car
yet
no
i
have
the
police
talked
to
them
and
claimed
they
knew
nothing
i
doubt
that
i
can
ask
them
anything
that
the
police
have
not
satisfied
themselves
about
miss
farrow
looked
up
at
me
sidewise
you
wo
find
anything
by
asking
people
who
have
never
heard
of
you
i
suppose
not
a
coptercab
came
along
at
that
moment
and
probably
sensing
my
intention
he
gave
his
horn
a
tap
i
have
liked
to
talk
longer
with
miss
farrow
but
a
cab
was
what
i
wanted
so
with
a
wave
i
took
it
and
she
went
on
down
the
steps
to
her
own
business
i
had
to
pause
long
enough
to
buy
a
new
car
but
a
few
hours
afterward
i
was
rolling
along
that
same
highway
with
my
esper
extended
as
far
as
i
could
in
all
directions
i
was
driving
slowly
this
time
both
alert
and
ready
i
went
past
the
scene
of
the
accident
slowly
and
shut
my
mind
off
as
i
saw
the
patch
the
block
was
still
hanging
from
an
overhead
branch
and
the
rope
that
had
burned
off
was
still
dangling
about
two
feet
of
it
looped
through
the
pulleys
and
ending
in
a
tapered
burned
end
i
turned
left
into
a
driveway
toward
the
home
of
the
harrisons
and
went
along
a
winding
dirt
road
growing
more
and
more
conscious
of
a
dead
area
ahead
of
me
it
was
not
a
real
dead
zone
because
i
could
still
penetrate
some
of
the
region
but
as
far
as
really
digging
any
of
the
details
of
the
rambling
harrison
house
i
could
get
more
from
my
eyesight
than
from
any
sense
of
perception
but
even
if
they
could
find
a
really
dead
area
the
harrisons
had
done
very
well
in
finding
one
that
made
my
sense
of
perception
ineffective
it
was
sort
of
like
looking
through
a
light
fog
and
the
closer
i
got
to
the
house
the
thicker
it
became
just
about
the
point
where
the
dead
area
was
first
beginning
to
make
its
effect
tell
i
came
upon
a
tall
browned
man
of
about
who
had
been
probing
into
the
interior
of
a
tractor
up
to
the
time
he
heard
my
car
he
waved
and
i
stopped
mr
harrison
i
phillip
and
you
are
mr
cornell
call
me
steve
like
everybody
else
i
said
how
you
guess
recognized
you
he
said
with
a
grin
i
the
guy
that
pulled
you
out
thanks
i
said
offering
a
hand
he
chuckled
steve
consider
the
hand
taken
and
shook
because
enough
grime
to
muss
up
a
regiment
it
wo
bother
me
i
said
thanks
but
it
still
a
gesture
and
i
appreciate
it
but
let
be
sensible
i
know
you
can
wash
but
let
shake
later
what
can
i
do
for
you
i
like
a
account
phil
not
much
to
tell
dad
and
i
were
pulling
stumps
over
about
a
thousand
feet
from
the
wreck
we
heard
the
racket
i
am
esper
enough
to
dig
that
distance
with
clarity
so
we
knew
we
better
bring
along
the
block
and
tackle
the
tractor
would
go
through
so
we
came
on
the
double
dad
rigged
the
tackle
and
hoisted
and
i
took
a
running
dive
grabbed
and
hauled
you
out
before
the
whole
thing
went
we
were
both
lucky
steve
i
grunted
a
bit
but
managed
to
nod
with
a
smile
i
suppose
you
know
that
i
still
trying
to
find
my
fiancée
i
heard
tell
he
said
he
looked
at
me
sharply
i
a
total
blank
as
a
telepath
like
all
espers
but
i
could
tell
what
he
was
thinking
everybody
is
convinced
that
catherine
was
not
with
me
i
admitted
but
i
not
i
know
she
was
he
shook
his
head
slowly
as
soon
as
we
heard
the
screech
of
brakes
and
rubber
we
esped
the
place
he
said
quietly
we
dug
you
of
course
but
no
one
else
even
if
she
jumped
as
soon
as
that
tree
limb
came
into
view
she
could
not
have
run
far
enough
to
be
out
of
range
as
for
removing
a
bag
she
have
had
to
wait
until
the
was
over
to
get
it
out
and
by
the
time
your
car
was
finished
rolling
dad
and
i
were
on
the
way
with
help
she
was
not
there
steve
you
a
goddam
liar
phillip
harrison
did
not
move
a
muscle
he
was
blank
telepathically
i
was
esping
the
muscles
in
his
stomach
under
his
loose
clothing
for
that
first
tensing
sign
of
anger
but
nothing
showed
he
had
not
been
reading
my
mind
i
smiled
thinly
at
phil
harrison
and
shrugged
he
smiled
back
sympathetically
but
behind
it
i
could
see
that
he
was
wishing
that
i
stop
harping
on
a
dead
subject
i
sincerely
wish
i
could
be
of
help
he
said
in
that
he
was
sincere
but
somewhere
someone
was
not
and
i
wanted
to
find
out
who
it
was
the
impasse
looked
as
though
it
might
go
on
forever
unless
i
turned
away
and
left
i
had
no
desire
to
leave
not
that
phil
could
help
me
but
even
though
this
was
a
dead
end
i
was
loath
to
leave
the
place
because
it
was
the
last
place
where
i
had
been
close
to
catherine
the
silence
between
us
must
have
been
a
bit
strained
at
this
point
but
luckily
we
had
an
interruption
i
perceived
motion
turned
and
caught
sight
of
a
woman
coming
along
the
road
toward
us
my
sister
said
phil
marian
marian
harrison
was
quite
a
girl
if
i
not
been
emotionally
tied
to
catherine
lewis
i
have
been
happy
to
invite
myself
in
marian
was
almost
as
tall
as
i
am
a
dark
woman
with
eyes
of
a
startling
electricity
colored
blue
she
was
about
young
and
healthy
her
skin
was
tanned
toast
brown
so
that
the
bright
blue
eyes
fairly
sparked
out
at
you
her
red
mouth
made
a
pleasing
blend
with
the
tan
of
her
skin
and
her
teeth
gleamed
white
against
the
dark
when
she
smiled
insultingly
i
made
some
complimentary
but
impolite
mental
observations
about
her
figure
but
marion
did
not
appear
to
notice
she
was
no
telepath
you
cornell
she
said
i
remembered
you
she
said
quietly
please
believe
us
cornell
when
we
extend
our
sympathy
thanks
i
said
glumly
please
understand
me
miss
harrison
i
appreciate
your
sympathy
but
what
i
need
is
action
and
information
and
answers
once
i
get
those
the
sympathy
wo
be
needed
of
course
i
understand
she
replied
instantly
we
are
all
aware
that
sympathy
is
a
poor
substitute
all
the
world
grieving
with
you
turn
a
stitch
to
help
you
out
of
your
trouble
all
we
can
do
is
to
wish
with
you
that
it
had
happened
that
the
point
i
said
helplessly
i
do
even
know
what
happened
that
makes
it
even
worse
she
said
softly
marian
had
a
pleasant
voice
throaty
and
low
that
sounded
intimate
even
when
talking
about
something
pragmatic
i
wish
we
could
help
you
steve
i
wish
someone
could
she
nodded
they
asked
me
about
it
too
even
though
i
was
not
present
until
afterward
they
asked
me
she
said
thoughtfully
about
the
mental
attitude
of
a
woman
running
off
to
get
married
i
told
them
that
i
could
speak
for
your
woman
but
that
i
might
be
able
to
speak
for
me
putting
myself
in
the
same
circumstances
she
paused
a
moment
and
her
brother
turned
idly
back
to
his
tractor
and
fitted
a
small
end
wrench
to
a
and
gave
it
a
twist
he
seemed
to
think
that
as
long
as
marian
and
i
were
talking
he
could
well
afford
to
get
along
with
his
work
i
agreed
with
him
i
wanted
information
but
i
did
not
expect
the
entire
world
to
stop
progress
to
help
me
he
spun
the
bolt
and
started
on
another
lost
in
his
job
while
marian
went
on
i
told
them
that
your
story
was
authentic
the
one
about
the
bridal
nightgown
a
very
slight
color
came
under
the
deep
tan
i
told
them
that
i
have
one
too
still
in
its
wrapper
and
that
someday
i
be
planning
marriage
and
packing
a
bag
with
the
gown
shaken
out
and
then
packed
neatly
i
told
them
that
i
be
doing
the
same
thing
no
matter
whether
we
were
having
a
formal
church
wedding
with
a
reception
and
all
the
trimmings
or
a
quiet
elopement
such
as
you
were
i
told
them
that
it
was
the
essentials
that
count
not
the
trimmings
and
the
tinsel
my
questioner
remark
was
to
the
effect
that
either
you
were
telling
the
truth
or
that
you
had
esped
a
woman
about
to
marry
and
identified
her
actions
with
your
own
wishes
i
know
which
i
said
with
a
sour
smile
it
was
both
marian
nodded
then
they
asked
me
if
it
were
probable
that
a
woman
would
take
this
step
completely
unprepared
and
i
laughed
at
them
i
told
them
that
long
before
rhine
women
were
putting
their
nuptial
affairs
in
order
about
the
time
the
gentleman
was
beginning
to
view
marriage
with
an
attitude
slightly
less
than
loathing
and
that
by
the
time
he
popped
the
question
she
been
practicing
writing
her
name
as
and
picking
out
the
and
prospective
names
for
the
children
and
that
if
any
woman
had
ever
been
so
stunned
by
a
proposal
of
marriage
that
she
take
off
without
so
much
as
a
toothbrush
no
one
in
history
had
ever
heard
of
her
then
you
begin
to
agree
with
me
she
shrugged
please
she
said
in
that
low
voice
do
ask
me
my
opinion
of
your
veracity
you
believe
it
but
all
the
evidence
lies
against
you
there
was
not
a
shred
of
anywhere
along
your
course
from
the
point
along
the
road
where
you
first
caught
sight
of
the
limb
that
threw
you
to
the
place
where
you
piled
up
nor
was
there
a
trace
anywhere
in
a
vast
circle
almost
a
half
mile
they
searched
from
the
they
had
doctors
of
psi
digging
for
footprints
shreds
of
clothing
everything
not
a
trace
but
where
did
she
go
i
cried
and
when
i
say
i
mean
just
that
marian
shook
her
head
very
slowly
steve
she
said
in
a
voice
so
low
that
i
could
hardly
hear
her
over
the
faint
shrill
of
bolts
being
unscrewed
by
her
brother
so
far
as
we
know
she
was
never
here
why
do
you
forget
her
i
looked
at
her
she
stood
there
poised
and
a
bit
tensed
as
though
she
were
trying
to
force
some
feeling
of
affectionate
kinhood
across
the
gap
that
separated
us
as
though
she
wanted
to
give
me
both
physical
and
mental
comfort
despite
the
fact
that
we
were
strangers
on
a
there
was
distress
in
her
face
forget
her
i
ground
out
i
rather
die
oh
steve
no
one
hand
went
to
her
throat
and
the
other
came
out
to
fasten
around
my
forearm
her
grip
was
hard
i
stood
there
wondering
what
to
do
next
marian
grip
on
my
arm
relaxed
and
she
stepped
back
i
pulled
myself
together
i
sorry
i
told
her
honestly
i
putting
you
through
a
set
of
emotional
hurdles
by
bringing
my
problems
here
better
take
them
away
she
nodded
very
slowly
please
go
but
please
come
back
once
you
get
yourself
squared
away
no
matter
how
we
all
like
to
see
you
when
you
are
all
tied
up
inside
phil
looked
up
from
the
guts
of
the
tractor
take
it
easy
steve
he
said
and
remember
that
you
do
have
friends
here
blindly
i
turned
from
them
and
stumbled
back
to
my
car
they
were
a
pair
of
very
fine
people
firm
upright
marian
grip
on
my
arm
had
been
no
weaker
than
her
sympathy
and
phil
approach
to
my
trouble
was
no
less
deep
actually
it
was
as
strong
as
his
good
right
arm
loosening
the
head
bolts
of
a
tractor
engine
with
a
small
adjustable
wrench
i
be
back
i
wanted
to
see
them
again
i
wanted
to
go
back
there
with
catherine
and
introduce
them
to
her
but
i
was
definitely
going
to
go
back
i
was
quite
a
way
toward
home
before
i
realized
that
i
had
not
met
the
old
man
i
bet
myself
that
father
harrison
was
quite
the
firm
active
patriarch
iv
the
days
dragged
slowly
i
faced
each
morning
hopefully
at
first
but
as
the
days
dragged
on
and
on
i
began
to
feel
that
each
morning
was
opening
another
day
of
futility
to
be
barely
borne
until
it
was
time
to
flop
down
in
weariness
i
faced
the
night
in
loneliness
and
in
anger
at
my
own
inability
to
do
something
productive
i
pestered
the
police
until
they
escorted
me
to
the
door
and
told
me
that
if
i
came
again
they
take
me
to
another
kind
of
door
and
loose
thereafter
the
key
i
shrugged
and
left
disconsolately
because
by
that
time
i
had
been
able
to
esp
page
by
page
the
entire
file
that
dealt
with
the
case
of
missing
person
lewis
catherine
stamped
inactive
but
not
closed
i
hated
the
words
but
as
the
days
dragged
out
one
after
another
with
no
respite
and
no
hope
my
raw
nervous
system
began
to
heal
it
was
probably
a
case
of
numbness
you
maul
your
thumb
with
a
hammer
and
it
will
hurt
just
so
long
before
it
stops
i
was
numb
for
a
long
time
i
remember
night
after
night
lying
awake
and
staring
into
the
darkness
at
the
wall
i
knew
was
beside
me
and
i
hated
my
esper
because
i
wanted
to
project
my
mind
out
across
some
unknown
space
to
reach
for
catherine
mind
if
we
both
been
telepaths
we
could
cross
the
universe
to
touch
each
other
with
that
affectionate
tenderness
that
mated
telepaths
always
claim
they
have
instead
i
found
myself
more
aware
of
a
perception
of
marian
harrison
as
she
took
my
arm
and
looked
into
my
face
on
that
day
when
i
admitted
that
i
found
little
worth
living
for
i
knew
what
that
meant
nothing
it
was
a
case
of
my
subconscious
mind
pointing
out
that
the
available
present
was
more
desirable
than
the
unavailable
at
first
i
resented
my
apparent
inconstancy
in
forming
an
esper
projection
of
marian
harrison
when
i
was
trying
to
project
my
blank
telepathic
inadequacy
to
catherine
but
as
the
weeks
faded
into
the
past
the
shock
and
the
frustration
began
to
pale
and
i
found
marian
projective
image
less
and
less
an
unwanted
intrusion
and
more
and
more
pleasant
i
had
two
deeply
depressed
spells
in
those
six
weeks
at
the
end
of
the
fourth
week
i
received
a
small
carton
containing
some
of
my
personal
junk
that
had
been
in
catherine
apartment
a
man
ca
date
his
girl
for
weeks
without
dropping
a
few
things
like
a
cigarette
lighter
a
tie
clip
one
odd
some
papers
a
few
letters
some
books
and
stuff
both
valuable
and
worthless
that
had
turned
up
as
gifts
for
one
reason
or
another
it
was
a
shock
to
get
this
box
and
its
arrival
bounced
me
deep
into
a
of
three
or
four
days
then
at
the
end
of
the
sixth
week
i
received
a
card
from
thorndyke
it
contained
a
lithograph
in
stereo
of
some
scene
in
yellowstone
other
than
old
faithful
blowing
its
stack
on
the
message
side
was
a
cryptic
note
i
just
drove
along
that
road
in
the
right
side
of
the
picture
it
reminded
me
of
yours
so
i
writing
because
i
want
to
know
how
you
are
making
out
i
be
at
the
in
a
couple
of
weeks
you
can
write
me
there
jim
i
turned
the
postcard
over
and
eyed
it
critically
then
i
got
it
along
the
roadside
was
a
tall
ornamental
standard
of
wrought
iron
the
same
design
as
the
road
signs
along
that
fatal
highway
of
mine
i
sat
there
with
a
magnifying
glass
on
the
roadsign
its
stereo
image
standing
up
alongside
the
road
in
full
color
and
solidity
it
took
me
back
to
that
moment
when
catherine
had
wriggled
against
my
side
thrilling
me
with
her
warmth
and
eagerness
that
put
me
down
a
few
days
too
another
month
passed
i
come
out
of
my
shell
quite
a
bit
in
the
meantime
i
now
felt
that
i
could
walk
in
a
bar
and
have
a
drink
without
wondering
whether
all
the
other
people
in
the
place
were
pointing
at
me
i
cut
myself
off
from
all
my
previous
friends
and
i
made
no
new
friends
in
the
weeks
gone
by
but
i
was
getting
more
and
more
lonely
and
consequently
more
and
more
inclined
to
speak
to
people
and
want
friends
the
accident
had
paled
from
its
original
horror
the
vital
scene
returned
only
infrequently
catherine
was
assuming
the
position
of
a
lost
love
rather
than
a
sweetheart
expected
to
return
soon
i
remembered
the
warmth
of
her
arms
and
the
eagerness
of
her
kiss
in
a
nostalgic
way
and
my
mind
especially
when
in
a
doze
would
play
me
tricks
i
would
recall
catherine
but
when
she
came
into
my
arms
i
be
holding
marian
brown
and
tawny
with
her
electric
blue
eyes
and
her
vibrant
nature
but
i
did
nothing
about
it
i
knew
that
once
i
had
asked
marian
harrison
for
a
date
i
would
be
emotionally
involved
and
then
if
no
when
catherine
turned
up
i
would
be
torn
between
desires
i
would
wake
up
and
call
myself
all
sorts
of
a
fool
i
had
seen
marian
for
a
total
of
perhaps
fifteen
minutes
in
the
company
of
her
brother
but
eventually
dreaming
loses
its
sting
just
as
futile
waiting
and
searching
does
and
i
awoke
one
morning
in
a
long
and
involved
debate
between
my
id
and
my
conscience
i
decided
at
that
moment
that
i
would
take
that
highway
out
and
pay
a
visit
to
the
harrison
farm
i
was
salving
my
slightly
rusty
conscience
by
telling
myself
that
it
was
because
i
had
never
paid
my
respects
to
father
harrison
but
not
too
deep
inside
i
knew
that
if
father
were
missing
and
daughter
were
present
i
enjoy
my
visit
to
the
farm
with
more
relish
but
my
id
took
a
licking
because
the
doorbell
rang
about
nine
that
morning
and
when
i
dug
the
doorstep
i
came
up
with
two
gentlemen
wearing
gold
badges
in
leather
folders
in
their
jacket
pockets
i
opened
the
door
because
i
could
have
played
absent
to
a
team
consisting
of
one
esper
and
one
telepath
they
both
knew
i
was
home
cornell
we
waste
no
time
we
want
to
know
how
well
you
know
doctor
james
thorndyke
i
did
blink
at
the
bluntness
of
it
it
is
standard
technique
when
an
team
go
investigating
the
telepath
knew
all
about
me
including
the
fact
that
i
dug
their
wallets
and
identification
cards
badges
and
the
serial
numbers
of
the
nasty
little
automatics
they
carried
the
idea
was
to
drive
the
important
question
hard
and
first
it
being
impossible
to
the
several
quick
answers
that
pop
through
your
mind
what
i
knew
about
thorndyke
was
sketchy
enough
but
they
got
it
all
because
i
did
have
any
reason
for
covering
up
i
let
them
know
that
too
finally
that
about
all
i
thought
now
why
the
telepath
half
of
the
team
answered
normally
we
would
answer
cornell
unless
you
said
it
aloud
but
we
do
mind
letting
you
know
which
of
us
is
the
telepath
this
time
to
answer
you
are
the
last
person
to
have
received
any
message
from
thorndyke
i
what
that
postcard
it
was
the
last
contact
thorndyke
made
with
anyone
he
has
disappeared
but
thorndyke
was
due
to
arrive
at
the
medical
research
center
in
marion
indiana
three
weeks
ago
we
been
tracking
him
ever
since
he
failed
to
turn
up
we
been
able
to
retrace
his
meanderings
very
well
up
to
a
certain
point
in
yellowstone
there
the
trail
stops
he
had
a
telephoned
reservation
to
a
small
hotel
there
he
dropped
out
of
sight
now
cornell
may
i
see
that
postcard
certainly
i
got
it
for
them
the
esper
took
it
over
to
the
window
and
eyed
it
in
the
light
and
as
he
did
that
i
went
over
to
stand
beside
him
and
together
we
espered
that
postcard
until
i
thought
the
edges
would
start
to
curl
but
if
there
were
any
codes
concealed
writings
or
any
other
form
of
hidden
meaning
or
message
in
or
on
that
card
i
did
dig
any
i
gave
up
i
no
trained
investigator
but
i
knew
that
thorndyke
was
fairly
well
acquainted
with
the
depth
of
my
perceptive
sense
and
he
would
not
have
concealed
anything
too
deep
for
me
then
the
esper
shook
his
head
he
handed
me
the
card
not
a
trace
the
telepath
nodded
he
looked
at
me
and
smiled
sort
of
thin
and
strained
we
naturally
interested
in
you
cornell
this
seems
to
be
the
second
disappearance
and
you
know
nothing
about
either
i
know
i
said
slowly
the
puzzle
began
to
go
around
and
around
in
my
head
again
all
the
way
back
to
that
gleaming
road
and
the
we
probably
be
back
cornell
you
do
mind
look
i
told
them
rather
firmly
if
this
puzzle
can
be
unwound
be
one
of
the
happiest
men
on
the
planet
if
i
can
do
anything
to
help
just
say
the
word
they
left
after
that
and
so
did
i
was
still
going
to
pay
my
visit
to
the
harrison
farm
another
wild
goose
chase
but
somewhere
along
this
cockeyed
row
there
was
an
angle
honest
people
who
are
healthy
and
fairly
happy
with
good
prospects
ahead
of
them
do
not
just
drop
out
of
sight
without
a
trace
a
couple
of
hours
later
i
was
making
a
good
pace
along
the
highway
again
it
was
getting
familiar
to
me
i
could
not
avoid
letting
my
perceptive
sense
rest
on
the
sign
as
i
drove
past
not
long
enough
to
put
me
in
danger
but
long
enough
to
discover
to
my
surprise
that
someone
had
taken
the
trouble
to
repair
the
broken
spoke
someone
must
have
been
a
perfectionist
the
break
was
so
slight
that
it
seemed
like
calling
in
a
mechanic
because
the
ashtray
in
the
car
is
full
then
i
noticed
other
changes
that
time
had
caused
the
burned
scar
was
fading
in
a
growth
of
tall
weeds
the
limb
of
the
tree
that
hung
out
over
the
scene
from
which
block
and
tackle
had
hung
was
beginning
to
lose
its
appearance
the
block
was
gone
from
the
limb
us
a
i
thought
the
only
remaining
scar
will
be
the
one
on
my
mind
and
even
that
will
be
i
turned
into
the
drive
wound
around
the
homestead
road
and
pulled
up
in
front
of
the
big
rambling
house
it
looked
bleak
the
front
lawn
was
a
bit
shaggy
and
there
were
some
wisps
of
paper
on
the
front
porch
the
venetian
blinds
were
down
and
slatted
shut
behind
closed
windows
since
it
was
summer
by
now
the
closed
windows
and
the
tight
door
neither
of
which
had
flyscreens
installed
quickly
gave
the
fact
away
the
harrisons
were
gone
another
disappearance
i
turned
quickly
and
drove
to
the
nearest
town
and
went
to
the
post
office
i
looking
for
the
harrison
family
i
told
the
man
behind
the
wicket
why
they
moved
several
weeks
ago
moved
i
asked
with
a
voice
the
clerk
nodded
then
he
leaned
forward
and
said
in
a
confidential
whisper
heard
a
rumor
that
the
girl
got
a
touch
of
that
disease
mekstrom
i
blurted
the
clerk
looked
at
me
as
if
i
shouted
a
dirty
word
she
was
a
fine
girl
he
said
softly
it
a
shame
i
nodded
and
he
went
into
the
back
files
i
tried
to
dig
alone
behind
him
but
the
files
were
in
a
small
dead
area
in
the
rear
of
the
building
i
swore
under
my
breath
although
i
expected
to
find
files
in
dead
areas
just
as
rhine
institute
was
opened
the
government
combed
the
countryside
for
dead
or
cloudy
areas
for
their
secret
and
confidential
files
there
had
been
one
mad
rush
with
the
government
about
six
feet
ahead
of
the
rest
of
the
general
public
business
and
the
underworld
he
came
back
with
a
sorrowful
look
they
left
a
concealed
address
he
said
i
felt
like
flashing
a
twenty
at
him
like
a
private
eye
did
in
the
old
but
i
knew
it
would
work
rhine
also
made
it
impossible
for
a
public
official
to
take
a
bribe
so
instead
i
tried
to
look
distressed
this
is
extremely
important
i
say
it
was
a
matter
of
life
and
death
i
sorry
a
concealed
forwarding
address
is
still
concealed
if
you
must
get
in
touch
with
them
you
might
drop
them
a
letter
to
be
forwarded
then
if
they
care
to
answer
they
reply
to
your
home
later
i
told
him
i
probably
be
back
to
mail
it
direct
from
here
he
waved
at
the
writing
desk
i
nodded
and
left
i
drove
back
to
the
farm
slowly
thinking
it
over
wondering
people
did
not
just
go
around
catching
mekstrom
disease
from
what
little
i
knew
of
it
and
somehow
the
idea
of
marian
harrison
withering
away
or
becoming
a
basket
case
or
maybe
taking
the
painless
way
out
was
a
thought
that
my
mind
kept
avoiding
except
for
occasional
flashes
of
horror
i
drove
in
toward
the
farmhouse
again
and
parked
in
front
of
the
verandah
i
was
not
sure
of
why
i
was
there
except
that
i
wanted
to
wander
through
it
to
see
what
i
could
find
before
i
went
back
to
the
to
write
that
card
or
letter
the
back
of
the
house
was
locked
with
an
slide
bolt
that
was
turned
with
what
they
used
to
call
an
e
key
i
shrugged
oiled
my
conscience
and
found
a
bit
of
bent
wire
probing
a
lock
like
that
would
have
been
easy
for
a
total
blank
with
esper
i
lifted
the
simple
keepers
and
slid
back
the
bolt
almost
as
swiftly
as
if
i
had
used
a
proper
key
this
was
no
case
of
disappearance
in
every
one
of
the
fourteen
rooms
were
the
unmistakable
signs
of
a
deliberate
removal
discarded
stuff
was
mixed
with
the
odds
and
ends
of
packing
case
materials
a
scattered
collection
of
temporary
nails
a
but
never
used
box
filled
with
old
clothing
i
pawed
through
this
but
found
nothing
even
though
i
separated
it
from
the
rest
to
help
my
esper
dig
it
without
interference
i
roamed
the
house
slowly
letting
my
perception
wander
from
point
to
point
i
tried
to
the
place
but
that
was
futile
i
did
have
enough
perception
i
caught
only
one
response
it
was
in
one
of
the
upper
bedrooms
but
then
as
i
stopped
in
the
room
where
marian
had
slept
i
began
again
to
doubt
my
senses
it
could
have
been
esper
but
it
was
more
likely
that
i
caught
the
dying
traces
of
perfume
then
i
suddenly
realized
that
the
entire
premises
were
clear
to
me
an
esper
map
of
the
world
looked
sort
of
like
a
mottled
sky
with
bright
places
and
cloudy
patches
strewn
in
disorder
across
it
a
mottled
sky
except
that
the
usually
does
not
change
but
this
house
had
been
in
a
murky
area
if
not
dead
now
it
was
clear
i
left
the
house
and
went
to
the
big
combination
barn
and
garage
it
was
as
unsatisfying
as
the
house
had
been
phillip
harrison
or
someone
had
had
a
workshop
out
there
i
found
the
bench
and
a
small
table
where
oil
marks
and
other
traces
said
that
there
had
been
one
of
those
big
combination
woodworking
machines
there
the
kind
that
combines
circular
saw
drill
lathe
planer
router
dado
and
does
everything
there
had
been
some
stuff
there
too
but
nothing
as
elaborate
as
the
woodshop
mostly
things
like
hacksaws
and
an
electric
drill
and
a
circular
scar
where
a
blowtorch
had
been
sitting
i
do
know
why
i
kept
on
standing
there
esping
the
abandoned
maybe
it
was
because
my
esper
dug
the
fact
that
there
was
something
there
that
i
should
know
about
but
which
was
so
minute
or
remote
that
the
impression
did
not
come
through
i
stood
there
puzzled
at
my
own
reluctance
to
leave
until
something
satisfied
that
almost
imperceptible
impression
idly
i
leaned
down
and
picked
up
a
bit
of
metal
from
the
floor
and
fumbled
it
in
my
hand
nervously
i
looked
around
the
place
with
my
eyes
and
saw
nothing
i
gave
the
whole
garage
a
thorough
scanning
with
my
esper
and
got
zero
for
my
trouble
finally
i
snarled
at
myself
for
being
an
imbecile
and
left
everyone
has
done
what
i
did
time
and
time
again
i
do
not
recall
anything
of
my
walk
back
to
the
car
lost
in
a
whirl
of
thoughts
ideas
plans
and
questions
i
would
probably
have
driven
all
the
way
back
to
my
apartment
with
my
mind
in
that
whirligig
driving
by
habit
and
training
but
i
was
shaken
out
of
it
because
i
could
not
start
my
car
by
poking
that
bit
of
metal
in
the
lock
it
did
not
fit
i
laughed
a
bit
ashamed
of
my
preoccupation
and
flung
the
bit
of
metal
into
the
grass
poked
my
key
in
the
lock
and
then
i
was
out
pawing
the
grass
for
that
piece
of
metal
for
the
small
piece
of
metal
i
had
found
on
the
floor
of
the
abandoned
workshop
was
the
spoke
of
that
road
sign
that
had
been
missing
when
catherine
and
i
cracked
up
i
drove
out
along
the
highway
and
stopped
near
one
of
the
standards
i
esped
the
sign
compared
my
impression
against
my
eyesight
i
made
sure
that
bit
of
metal
a
half
inch
long
and
a
bit
under
a
quarter
inch
in
diameter
with
both
ends
faintly
was
identical
in
size
and
shape
to
the
unbroken
spokes
in
the
sign
then
i
noticed
something
else
the
trefoil
ornament
in
the
middle
did
not
look
the
same
as
i
recalled
them
i
took
thorndyke
card
out
of
my
pocket
and
looked
at
the
stereo
i
compared
the
picture
against
the
real
thing
before
me
and
i
knew
that
i
was
right
the
trefoil
gizmo
was
a
on
the
or
the
boy
scout
tenderfoot
badge
or
the
design
they
use
to
signify
north
on
a
compass
but
the
lower
flare
of
the
leaves
was
wider
than
any
of
the
more
familiar
emblems
almost
as
wide
as
the
top
it
took
a
comparison
to
tell
the
difference
between
one
of
them
and
another
one
one
assumes
for
this
design
that
the
larger
foils
are
supposed
to
be
up
if
that
were
so
then
the
ones
along
that
road
out
there
in
or
near
yellowstone
were
while
the
ones
along
my
familiar
highway
were
i
goaded
myself
memory
have
these
things
been
turned
or
were
they
always
the
last
thing
i
did
as
i
turned
off
the
highway
was
to
stop
and
let
my
esper
dig
that
design
once
more
i
covered
the
design
itself
let
my
perception
roam
along
the
spokes
and
then
around
the
circlet
that
supported
the
spokes
that
held
the
trefoil
emblem
oh
it
was
not
obvious
it
was
designed
in
so
to
speak
if
i
were
asked
even
today
for
my
professional
opinion
i
would
have
to
admit
that
the
way
the
circlet
snapped
into
the
rest
of
the
ornamental
scrollwork
was
a
matter
of
good
assembly
design
and
not
a
design
deliberately
created
so
that
the
emblem
could
be
turned
upside
down
in
fact
if
it
had
not
been
for
that
tiny
broken
spoke
i
found
on
the
floor
of
the
harrison
garage
never
in
a
million
years
would
i
have
considered
these
road
signs
significant
at
the
post
office
i
wrote
a
letter
to
phillip
harrison
phil
was
by
your
old
place
today
and
was
sorry
to
find
that
you
had
moved
i
like
to
get
in
touch
with
you
again
if
i
may
ask
please
send
me
your
forwarding
address
i
keep
it
concealed
if
you
like
or
i
reply
through
the
post
office
concealed
an
item
of
interest
did
you
know
that
your
house
has
lost
its
deadness
a
esper
can
dig
it
with
ease
have
you
ever
heard
of
the
changing
before
and
another
item
that
road
sign
with
the
busted
spoke
has
been
replaced
you
must
be
a
bum
shot
not
to
hit
that
curlicue
in
the
middle
i
found
the
spoke
you
hit
on
the
floor
of
your
garage
if
you
like
it
for
a
souvenir
of
one
close
write
and
let
me
know
how
things
are
going
rumor
has
it
that
marian
contracted
mekstrom
and
if
you
will
pardon
my
mentioning
a
delicate
subject
i
am
doing
so
because
i
really
want
to
help
if
i
am
able
after
all
no
matter
how
lightly
you
hold
it
i
still
owe
you
my
life
this
is
a
debt
i
do
not
intend
to
v
i
did
not
go
to
the
police
they
were
sick
of
my
face
and
already
considering
me
a
candidate
for
the
paranoid
ward
all
i
would
have
to
do
is
go
roaring
into
the
station
to
tell
them
that
i
had
uncovered
some
deep
plot
where
the
underground
was
using
ornamental
road
signs
to
conceal
their
own
network
of
roads
and
directions
and
that
the
disappearance
of
catherine
lewis
thorndyke
and
the
removal
of
the
harrisons
were
all
tied
together
instead
i
closed
my
apartment
and
told
everyone
that
i
was
going
to
take
a
long
rambling
tourist
jaunt
to
settle
my
nerves
that
i
thought
getting
away
from
the
scene
might
finish
the
job
that
time
and
rest
had
started
then
i
started
to
drive
i
drove
for
several
days
not
attempting
to
pace
off
miles
but
covering
a
lot
of
territory
i
was
just
as
likely
to
spend
four
hours
going
north
on
one
highway
and
then
take
the
next
four
coming
back
south
on
a
parallel
highway
and
sometimes
i
even
came
back
to
the
original
starting
place
after
a
week
i
had
come
no
farther
west
than
across
that
sliver
of
west
virginia
into
eastern
ohio
and
in
eastern
ohio
i
saw
some
more
of
the
now
familiar
and
suspicious
road
signs
the
emblem
was
right
side
up
and
the
signs
looked
as
though
they
had
not
been
up
long
i
followed
that
road
for
miles
and
as
i
went
the
signs
kept
getting
newer
and
newer
until
i
finally
came
to
a
truck
loaded
with
pipe
hardware
and
ornamental
ironwork
leading
the
truck
was
one
of
those
iron
mole
things
i
watched
the
automatic
gear
hoist
one
of
the
old
pipe
and
white
and
black
enamel
roadsigns
up
by
its
roots
and
place
it
on
a
truck
full
of
discards
i
watched
the
mole
drive
a
corkscrew
blade
into
the
ground
with
a
roaring
of
engine
and
bucking
of
the
truck
it
paused
pulled
upward
to
bring
out
the
screw
and
its
load
of
dirt
stones
and
gravel
the
crew
placed
one
of
the
new
signs
in
the
cradle
and
i
watched
the
machine
set
the
sign
upright
pour
the
concrete
tamp
down
the
earth
and
then
move
along
down
the
road
there
was
little
point
in
asking
questions
of
the
crew
so
i
just
took
off
and
drove
to
columbus
as
hard
as
i
could
make
it
shined
cleaned
polished
and
very
conservatively
dressed
i
presented
myself
to
the
state
commissioner
of
roads
and
highways
i
toyed
briefly
with
the
idea
of
representing
myself
as
a
minor
official
from
some
distant
state
like
alaska
or
the
virgin
islands
inquiring
about
these
signs
for
official
reasons
but
then
i
knew
that
if
i
bumped
into
a
hot
telepath
i
be
in
the
soup
on
the
other
hand
mere
curiosity
on
the
part
of
a
citizen
well
oiled
with
compliments
would
get
me
at
the
very
least
a
polite
answer
the
commissioner
bucked
me
down
the
hall
another
office
bucked
me
upstairs
a
third
brought
me
to
the
department
of
highways
marking
and
road
maps
a
finally
admitted
that
he
might
be
able
to
help
me
his
name
was
houghton
but
whether
he
was
telepath
or
esper
did
not
matter
because
the
commission
building
was
constructed
right
in
the
middle
of
a
dead
area
i
still
played
it
straight
i
told
him
i
was
a
citizen
of
new
york
interested
in
the
new
road
signs
ohio
was
to
be
commended
et
cetera
i
glad
you
feel
that
way
he
said
beaming
i
presume
these
signs
cost
quite
a
bit
more
than
the
stark
black
and
white
enamel
jobs
on
the
contrary
he
said
with
pride
they
might
but
methods
brought
the
cost
down
you
see
the
enamel
jobs
while
we
buy
several
thousand
of
the
plates
for
any
highway
must
be
set
up
stamped
out
enamelled
and
so
on
the
new
signs
are
all
made
in
one
plant
as
they
are
needed
i
do
suppose
you
know
but
the
highway
number
and
any
other
information
is
put
on
the
plate
from
loose
letters
that
means
we
can
buy
so
many
thousand
of
this
or
that
letter
or
number
and
the
necessary
base
plates
and
put
them
together
as
needed
they
admitted
that
they
were
still
running
at
a
loss
but
if
they
could
get
enough
states
interested
they
eventually
come
out
even
and
maybe
they
could
reduce
the
cost
why
they
even
have
a
in
the
contract
stating
that
if
the
cost
were
lowered
they
would
make
a
rebate
to
cover
it
that
so
the
first
users
will
not
bide
their
time
instead
of
buying
now
he
went
on
and
on
and
on
like
any
bureaucrat
i
was
glad
we
were
in
a
dead
area
because
he
have
thrown
me
out
of
his
office
for
what
i
was
thinking
eventually
houghton
ran
down
and
i
left
i
toyed
around
with
the
idea
of
barging
in
on
the
main
office
of
the
company
but
i
figured
that
might
be
too
much
like
poking
my
head
into
a
hornet
nest
i
pocketed
the
card
he
gave
me
from
the
company
and
i
studied
the
road
map
which
he
had
proudly
supplied
it
pointed
out
in
a
replica
panel
of
the
fancy
signs
that
the
state
of
ohio
was
beautifying
their
highways
with
these
new
signs
at
no
increased
cost
to
the
taxpayer
and
that
the
dates
in
green
on
the
various
highways
here
and
there
gave
the
dates
when
the
new
signs
would
be
installed
the
bottom
of
the
panel
gave
the
road
commissioner
name
in
boldface
with
houghton
name
below
in
slightly
smaller
print
i
smiled
usually
i
get
mad
at
signs
that
proclaim
that
such
and
such
a
tunnel
is
being
created
by
mayor
as
if
the
good
mayor
were
out
there
with
a
shovel
and
hoe
digging
the
tunnel
but
this
sort
of
thing
would
have
been
a
worthy
cause
if
it
had
been
for
the
sinister
side
i
selected
a
highway
that
had
been
completed
toward
cincinnati
and
made
my
way
there
with
no
waste
of
time
the
road
was
new
and
it
was
another
beaut
the
signs
led
me
on
mile
after
mile
and
sign
after
sign
i
did
not
know
what
i
was
following
and
i
was
not
sure
i
knew
what
i
was
looking
for
but
i
was
on
the
trail
of
something
and
a
bit
of
activity
both
mental
and
physical
after
weeks
of
frustration
made
my
spirits
rise
and
my
mental
equipment
sharper
the
radio
in
the
car
was
yangling
with
hillbilly
songs
the
only
thing
you
can
pick
up
in
ohio
but
i
did
care
i
was
looking
for
something
significant
i
found
it
late
in
the
afternoon
about
between
dayton
and
cincinnati
one
of
the
spokes
was
missing
fifty
yards
ahead
was
a
crossroad
i
hauled
in
with
a
whine
of
rubber
and
brakes
and
sat
there
trying
to
reason
out
my
next
move
by
logic
do
i
turn
with
the
missing
spoke
or
do
i
turn
with
the
one
that
is
not
missing
memory
came
to
my
aid
the
ten
spoke
had
been
missing
back
there
near
the
harrison
farm
the
harrisons
had
lived
on
the
left
side
of
the
highway
one
follows
the
missing
spoke
here
the
two
spoke
was
missing
so
i
turned
to
the
right
along
the
crossroad
until
i
came
to
another
sign
that
was
complete
then
wondering
i
and
drove
back
across
the
main
highway
and
drove
for
about
five
miles
watching
the
signs
as
i
went
the
ones
on
my
right
had
that
trefoil
emblem
upside
down
the
ones
on
my
left
were
right
side
up
the
difference
was
so
small
that
only
someone
who
knew
the
significance
would
distinguish
one
from
the
other
so
far
as
i
could
reason
out
it
meant
that
what
i
sought
was
in
the
other
direction
when
the
emblem
was
upside
down
i
was
going
away
from
and
when
right
side
up
i
was
going
toward
away
from
or
toward
what
i
again
and
started
following
the
signs
twenty
miles
beyond
the
main
highway
where
i
seen
the
sign
that
announced
the
turn
i
came
upon
another
missing
spoke
this
indicated
a
turn
to
the
left
and
so
i
slowed
down
until
i
came
upon
a
homestead
road
leading
off
toward
a
farmhouse
i
turned
determined
to
make
like
a
man
lost
and
hoping
that
i
not
bump
into
a
telepath
a
few
hundred
yards
in
from
the
main
road
i
came
upon
a
girl
who
was
walking
briskly
toward
me
i
stopped
she
looked
at
me
with
a
quizzical
smile
and
asked
me
if
she
could
be
of
any
help
brashly
i
nodded
i
looking
for
some
old
friends
of
mine
i
said
have
seen
them
for
years
named
harrison
she
smiled
up
at
me
i
do
know
of
any
harrison
around
here
her
voice
had
the
ohio
twang
no
just
where
do
they
live
i
eyed
her
carefully
hoping
my
glance
did
not
look
like
a
wolf
eyeing
a
lamb
well
they
gave
me
some
crude
directions
said
i
was
to
turn
at
the
main
highway
onto
this
road
and
come
about
twenty
miles
and
stop
on
the
left
side
when
i
came
upon
one
of
those
new
road
signs
where
someone
had
shot
one
of
the
spokes
out
spokes
left
side
she
mumbled
the
words
and
was
apparently
mulling
the
idea
around
in
her
mind
she
was
not
more
than
about
seventeen
and
from
living
in
the
open
i
wondered
about
her
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
she
was
part
and
parcel
of
this
whole
mysterious
affair
no
matter
what
she
said
or
did
it
was
an
obvious
fact
that
the
hidden
road
sign
directions
pointed
to
this
farm
and
since
no
one
at
seventeen
can
be
kept
in
complete
ignorance
of
the
business
of
the
parents
she
must
be
aware
of
some
of
the
ramifications
after
some
thought
she
said
no
i
do
know
of
any
harrisons
i
grunted
i
was
really
making
the
least
of
this
now
that
i
arrived
your
folks
at
home
i
asked
yes
she
replied
i
think
i
drop
in
and
ask
them
too
she
shrugged
go
ahead
she
said
with
the
noncommittal
attitude
of
youth
you
did
happen
to
notice
whether
the
mailbox
flag
was
up
did
you
i
had
but
i
espied
back
quickly
and
said
no
it
is
then
the
mailman
has
been
to
deliver
she
said
mind
if
i
ride
back
to
the
house
with
you
mister
hop
in
she
smiled
brightly
and
got
in
quickly
i
took
off
down
the
road
toward
the
house
at
an
easy
pace
she
seemed
interested
in
the
car
and
finally
said
i
never
been
in
a
car
like
this
before
new
few
weeks
i
responded
fast
if
you
want
to
make
it
go
fast
she
take
this
rocky
road
at
fifty
if
anyone
wants
to
be
so
foolish
let
see
i
laughed
nobody
but
an
idiot
would
tackle
a
road
like
this
at
fifty
i
like
to
go
fast
my
brother
takes
it
at
sixty
that
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
was
youthful
exaggeration
i
was
busy
telling
her
all
the
perils
of
fast
driving
when
a
rabbit
came
barrelling
out
of
the
bushes
along
one
side
and
streaked
across
in
front
of
me
i
twitched
the
wheel
the
car
went
out
of
the
narrow
road
and
up
on
the
shoulder
tilting
quite
a
bit
beyond
the
rabbit
i
swung
back
into
the
road
but
not
before
the
youngster
had
grabbed
my
arm
to
keep
from
being
tossed
all
over
the
front
seat
her
grip
was
like
a
hydraulic
vise
my
arm
went
numb
and
my
fingers
went
limp
on
the
wheel
i
struggled
with
my
left
hand
to
spin
the
wheel
to
keep
on
the
narrow
winding
road
and
my
foot
hit
the
brake
to
bring
the
car
down
but
fast
taking
a
deep
breath
as
we
stopped
i
shook
my
right
hand
by
holding
it
in
my
left
at
the
wrist
i
was
a
mass
of
tingling
pins
and
needles
because
she
had
grabbed
me
just
above
the
elbow
it
felt
as
though
it
would
have
taken
only
a
trifle
more
to
pinch
my
arm
off
and
leave
me
with
a
bloody
stump
sorry
mister
she
said
breathlessly
her
eyes
wide
open
her
face
was
white
around
the
corners
of
the
mouth
and
at
the
edges
of
her
nose
the
whiteness
of
the
flesh
under
the
deep
tan
gave
her
a
completely
frightened
look
far
more
than
the
could
have
produced
i
reached
over
and
took
her
hand
that
a
mighty
powerful
grip
you
the
flesh
of
her
hand
was
hard
and
solid
not
the
meaty
solidity
of
good
tone
fine
training
and
excellent
health
it
was
the
solidity
of
a
all
i
could
think
of
at
the
time
was
a
green
cucumber
i
squeezed
a
bit
and
the
flesh
gave
way
only
a
trifle
i
rubbed
my
thumb
over
her
palm
and
found
it
instead
of
soft
and
yielding
i
wondered
i
had
never
seen
a
case
of
mekstrom
disease
before
i
looked
down
at
the
hand
and
said
young
lady
do
you
realize
that
you
have
an
advanced
case
of
mekstrom
disease
she
eyed
me
coldly
now
she
said
in
a
hard
voice
i
know
you
come
in
something
in
my
objects
violently
to
being
ordered
around
by
a
slip
of
a
girl
i
balance
off
at
about
i
guessed
her
at
about
of
that
say
or
thereabouts
she
said
levelly
a
telepath
yes
she
replied
calmly
and
i
do
mind
letting
you
know
it
so
you
not
try
anything
stupid
i
getting
the
heck
out
of
here
no
you
not
you
are
coming
in
with
me
like
heck
i
exploded
do
be
silly
you
come
in
or
shall
i
lay
one
along
your
jaw
and
carry
you
i
had
to
try
something
anything
to
get
free
yet
now
you
being
she
told
me
insolently
you
should
know
that
you
ca
plan
any
surprise
move
with
a
telepath
and
if
you
try
a
frontal
attack
i
belt
you
so
cold
they
have
to
put
you
in
the
oven
for
a
week
i
just
let
her
ramble
for
a
few
seconds
because
when
she
was
rattling
this
way
she
could
put
her
entire
mental
attention
on
my
thoughts
so
while
she
was
yaking
it
off
i
had
an
idea
that
felt
as
though
it
might
work
she
shut
up
like
a
clam
when
she
realized
that
her
mouthing
had
given
me
a
chance
to
think
and
i
went
into
high
gear
with
my
perception
not
bad
for
a
kid
growing
up
fast
been
playing
hookey
from
momma
leaving
off
your
panties
like
the
big
girls
do
i
can
tell
by
the
elastic
cord
marks
you
had
on
not
long
seventeeners
have
a
lot
more
modesty
than
they
like
to
admit
she
was
stunned
by
my
catalog
of
her
body
just
long
enough
for
me
to
make
a
quick
lunge
across
her
lap
to
the
door
handle
on
her
side
i
flipped
it
over
and
gave
her
a
shove
at
the
same
time
she
went
bottom
over
appetite
in
a
sprawl
that
would
have
jarred
the
teeth
loose
in
a
normal
body
and
might
have
cracked
a
few
bones
but
she
landed
on
the
back
of
her
neck
rolled
and
came
to
her
feet
like
a
cat
i
did
wait
to
close
the
door
i
just
tromped
on
the
and
the
car
leaped
forward
with
a
jerk
that
slammed
the
door
for
me
i
roared
forward
and
left
her
just
as
she
was
making
another
grab
how
i
hoped
to
get
out
of
there
i
did
not
know
all
i
wanted
was
momentary
freedom
to
think
i
turned
this
way
and
that
to
follow
the
road
until
i
came
to
the
house
i
left
the
road
circled
the
house
with
the
turbine
screaming
like
a
banshee
and
the
car
taking
the
corners
on
the
outside
wheels
i
skidded
into
a
turn
like
a
racing
driver
and
ironed
my
wheels
out
flat
on
the
takeaway
rounded
another
corner
and
turned
back
into
the
road
again
going
the
other
way
she
was
standing
there
waiting
for
me
as
i
pelted
past
at
a
good
sixty
and
she
reached
out
one
arm
latched
onto
the
frame
of
the
open
window
on
my
side
and
swung
onto
the
trim
along
the
bottom
of
the
like
a
switchman
hooking
a
freight
car
she
reached
for
the
steering
wheel
with
her
free
hand
i
knew
what
was
to
happen
next
she
casually
haul
and
i
go
off
the
road
into
a
tree
or
pile
up
in
a
ditch
and
while
the
smoke
was
clearing
out
of
my
mind
she
be
untangling
me
from
the
wreck
and
carting
me
over
her
shoulder
without
a
scratch
to
show
for
her
adventure
i
yanked
the
wheel
whip
whap
cutting
an
arc
i
slammed
past
a
tree
missing
it
by
half
an
inch
i
wiped
her
off
the
side
of
the
car
like
a
mailbag
is
clipped
from
the
fast
express
by
the
i
heard
a
cry
of
whoof
as
her
body
hit
the
trunk
of
the
tree
but
as
i
regained
the
road
and
went
racing
on
to
safety
i
saw
in
the
rear
view
mirror
that
she
had
bounced
off
the
tree
sprawled
a
bit
caught
her
balance
and
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
road
shaking
her
small
but
very
dangerous
fist
at
my
tail
license
plate
i
did
stop
driving
at
until
i
was
above
dayton
again
then
i
paused
along
the
road
to
take
stock
stock
what
the
hell
did
i
know
really
i
uncovered
and
confirmed
the
fact
that
there
was
some
secret
organization
that
had
a
program
that
included
their
own
highway
system
concealed
within
the
confines
of
the
united
states
i
was
almost
certain
by
this
time
that
they
had
been
the
prime
movers
in
the
disappearance
of
catherine
and
thorndyke
they
i
suddenly
the
big
willingly
now
no
longer
rejecting
the
memory
i
followed
my
recollection
as
catherine
and
i
went
along
that
highway
at
a
happy
pace
with
care
i
recalled
every
detail
of
catherine
watching
the
road
through
my
mind
and
eyes
how
she
mentioned
the
case
of
the
missing
spoke
and
how
i
projected
back
to
perceive
that
which
i
had
not
been
conscious
of
reminding
myself
that
it
was
past
i
went
through
it
again
deliberately
the
fallen
limb
that
blocked
the
road
my
own
horror
as
the
wheels
hit
it
the
struggle
to
regain
control
of
the
careening
car
as
a
man
watching
a
motion
picture
i
watched
the
sky
and
the
earth
turn
over
and
over
and
i
heard
my
voice
mouthing
wordless
shouts
of
fear
catherine
cry
of
pain
and
fright
came
and
i
listened
as
my
mind
reconstructed
it
this
time
without
wincing
then
the
final
crash
the
horrid
wave
of
pain
and
the
sear
of
the
i
went
through
my
own
horror
and
self
condemnation
and
my
concern
over
catherine
i
did
shut
if
off
i
waded
through
it
now
i
remembered
something
else
something
that
any
normal
sensible
mind
would
reject
as
an
hallucination
beyond
any
shadow
of
a
doubt
there
had
been
no
time
for
a
man
to
rig
a
block
and
tackle
on
a
tree
above
a
burning
automobile
in
time
to
get
the
trapped
victims
out
alive
and
even
more
certain
it
was
that
no
normal
man
of
fifty
would
have
had
enough
strength
to
lift
a
car
by
its
front
bumper
while
his
son
made
a
rush
into
the
flames
that
tackle
had
been
rigged
and
burned
afterward
but
who
would
reject
a
block
and
tackle
in
favor
of
an
impossibly
strong
man
no
with
the
tackle
in
sight
the
recollection
of
a
man
lifting
that
overturned
automobile
like
a
weight
lifter
pressing
up
a
bar
bell
would
be
buried
in
any
mind
as
a
rank
hallucination
then
one
more
item
came
driving
home
hard
so
hard
that
i
almost
jumped
when
the
idea
crossed
my
mind
both
catherine
and
thorndyke
had
been
telepaths
a
telepath
close
to
any
member
of
his
underground
outfit
would
divine
their
purpose
come
to
know
their
organization
and
begin
to
grasp
the
fundamentals
of
their
program
such
a
person
would
be
dangerous
on
the
other
hand
an
esper
such
as
myself
could
be
turned
aside
with
bland
remarks
and
a
convincing
attitude
i
knew
that
i
had
no
way
of
telling
lie
from
truth
and
that
made
my
problem
a
lot
more
difficult
from
the
facts
that
i
did
have
something
smelled
of
overripe
seafood
government
and
charities
were
pouring
scads
of
dough
into
a
joint
called
the
medical
research
center
to
hear
the
scholars
of
medicine
tell
it
mekstrom
disease
was
about
the
last
human
frailty
that
had
been
licked
to
a
standstill
they
boasted
that
if
a
victim
of
practically
anything
had
enough
life
left
in
him
to
crawl
to
a
telephone
and
use
it
his
life
could
be
saved
they
grafted
well
i
heard
tales
of
things
like
fingers
and
i
know
they
were
experimenting
on
hands
arms
and
legs
with
some
success
but
when
it
came
to
mekstrom
they
were
stopped
cold
therefore
the
medical
research
center
received
a
walloping
batch
of
money
for
that
alone
all
the
money
that
used
to
go
to
the
various
heart
lung
spine
and
cancer
funds
it
added
up
well
but
the
medical
research
center
seemed
unaware
that
some
group
had
solved
their
basic
problem
from
the
books
i
read
i
am
well
aware
of
one
of
the
fundamental
principles
of
running
an
underground
it
underground
the
commie
menace
in
these
united
states
might
have
won
out
in
the
middle
of
the
century
if
they
been
able
to
stay
a
secret
organization
so
the
highways
in
hiding
could
stay
underground
and
be
an
efficient
organization
only
until
someone
smoked
them
out
that
one
was
going
to
be
me
but
i
needed
an
especially
and
specifically
i
needed
a
trained
telepath
one
who
would
listen
to
my
tale
and
not
instantly
howl
for
the
attendants
the
were
all
trained
investigators
and
they
used
teams
all
the
time
one
dug
the
joint
while
the
other
dug
the
inhabitant
which
covered
the
situation
to
a
faretheewell
it
would
take
time
to
come
up
with
a
possible
helper
so
i
spent
the
next
hour
driving
toward
chicago
and
by
the
time
i
crossed
the
line
and
hit
richmond
i
had
a
plan
laid
out
i
placed
a
call
to
new
york
and
within
a
few
minutes
i
was
talking
to
nurse
farrow
i
not
go
into
detail
because
there
was
a
lot
of
that
is
not
particularly
interesting
and
a
lot
more
that
covered
my
tracks
since
parted
company
with
her
on
the
steps
of
the
hospital
i
did
not
of
course
mention
my
real
purpose
over
the
telephone
and
miss
farrow
could
not
read
my
mind
from
new
york
the
upshot
of
the
deal
was
that
i
felt
that
i
needed
a
nurse
for
a
while
not
that
i
was
ill
but
that
i
felt
a
bit
woozy
now
and
then
because
i
had
learned
to
slow
down
i
worked
too
fast
and
too
long
and
my
condition
was
not
up
to
it
yet
this
miss
farrow
allowed
as
being
quite
possible
i
repeated
my
offer
to
pay
her
at
the
going
prices
for
registered
nurses
with
a
guarantee
paid
in
advance
that
softened
her
quite
a
bit
then
i
added
that
i
videograph
her
a
check
large
enough
to
cover
the
works
plus
a
round
trip
ticket
she
should
come
out
and
have
a
look
and
if
she
were
satisfied
she
could
return
without
digging
into
her
own
pocket
all
she
lose
was
one
day
and
it
might
be
a
bit
of
a
vacation
if
she
enjoyed
flying
in
a
jetliner
at
sixty
thousand
feet
the
accumulation
of
offers
finally
sold
her
and
she
agreed
to
arrange
a
leave
of
absence
she
meet
me
in
the
morning
of
the
at
central
airport
in
chicago
i
videographed
the
check
and
then
took
off
again
confident
that
i
be
able
to
sell
her
on
the
idea
of
being
the
telepath
half
of
my
amateur
investigation
team
then
because
i
needed
some
direct
information
i
turned
west
and
crossed
the
line
into
indiana
heading
toward
marion
so
far
i
had
a
lot
of
suspicions
but
until
i
was
certain
i
could
do
no
more
than
postulate
ideas
i
had
to
know
definitely
how
to
identify
disease
or
at
least
the
infected
flesh
i
have
a
fairly
good
recall
all
i
needed
now
was
to
have
someone
point
to
a
case
and
say
flatly
that
this
was
a
case
of
mekstrom
disease
then
i
know
whether
what
seen
in
ohio
was
actually
one
hundred
percent
mekstrom
vi
i
walked
into
the
front
office
with
a
lot
of
the
medical
center
was
a
big
rambling
place
with
a
lot
of
and
buildings
that
looked
so
much
like
hospital
that
no
one
in
the
world
would
have
mistaken
them
for
anything
else
the
main
building
was
by
the
road
the
rest
spread
out
behind
as
far
as
i
could
see
beyond
my
esper
range
even
though
the
whole
business
was
set
in
one
of
the
clearest
psi
areas
that
i
even
been
in
i
was
only
mildly
worried
about
telepaths
in
the
first
place
the
only
thing
i
had
to
hide
was
my
conviction
about
a
secret
organization
and
how
part
of
it
functioned
in
the
second
place
the
chances
were
good
that
few
if
any
telepaths
were
working
there
if
the
case
of
thorndyke
carried
any
weight
that
there
were
some
telepaths
i
did
not
doubt
but
these
would
not
be
among
the
help
so
i
sailed
in
and
faced
the
receptionist
who
was
a
blonde
with
a
pale
skin
lovely
complexion
and
figure
to
match
she
greeted
me
with
a
glacial
calm
and
asked
my
business
brazenly
i
lied
i
a
freelance
writer
and
i
looking
for
material
have
you
an
assignment
she
asked
without
a
trace
of
interest
in
the
answer
not
this
time
i
strictly
freelance
i
like
it
better
this
way
because
i
can
write
whatever
i
like
her
glacial
air
melted
a
bit
at
the
inference
that
my
writing
had
not
been
in
vain
where
have
you
been
published
she
asked
i
made
a
fast
stab
in
the
dark
aiming
in
a
direction
that
looked
safe
last
article
was
one
on
the
latest
archeological
findings
in
assyria
got
my
source
material
direct
from
the
oriental
institute
in
chicago
too
bad
i
missed
it
she
said
looking
regretful
i
had
to
grin
carefully
avoided
giving
the
name
of
the
publication
and
the
supposed
date
she
went
on
i
suppose
you
would
not
be
happy
with
the
usual
press
release
handouts
contain
material
all
right
but
they
so
confounded
trite
and
impersonal
people
prefer
to
read
anecdotes
about
the
people
rather
than
a
listing
of
facts
and
figures
she
nodded
at
that
just
a
moment
she
said
then
she
addressed
her
telephone
in
a
voice
that
i
could
hear
when
she
finished
she
smiled
in
a
manner
as
if
to
indicate
that
she
gone
all
out
in
my
behalf
and
that
i
be
a
heel
to
forget
it
i
nodded
back
and
tried
to
match
the
smile
then
the
door
opened
and
a
man
came
in
briskly
he
was
a
tall
man
as
straight
as
a
ramrod
with
a
firm
jaw
and
a
moustache
he
had
an
air
like
a
captain
bligh
when
he
spoke
his
voice
was
as
clipped
and
precise
as
his
moustache
in
fact
it
was
so
precise
that
it
seemed
almost
mechanical
i
am
lyon
sprague
he
clipped
what
may
i
do
for
you
i
steve
cornell
i
said
i
here
after
source
material
for
a
magazine
article
about
mekstrom
disease
i
prefer
not
to
take
my
material
from
a
handout
do
you
hope
to
get
more
he
demanded
i
usually
do
i
seen
your
handouts
i
could
get
as
much
by
taking
last
year
medical
encyclopedia
far
too
dry
too
uninteresting
too
impersonal
just
exactly
what
do
you
have
in
mind
i
eyed
him
with
speculation
here
was
not
a
man
who
would
take
kindly
to
imaginative
conjecture
so
lyon
sprague
was
not
the
man
i
like
to
talk
to
with
an
inward
smile
i
said
i
have
a
rather
new
idea
about
mekstrom
that
i
like
to
discuss
with
the
right
party
he
looked
down
at
me
although
our
eyes
were
on
the
same
level
i
doubt
that
any
layman
could
possibly
come
up
with
an
idea
that
has
not
been
most
thoroughly
discussed
here
among
the
research
staff
in
cold
words
you
feel
that
no
untrained
lunk
has
a
right
to
have
an
idea
he
froze
i
did
not
say
that
you
implied
at
least
that
suggestions
from
outsiders
were
not
welcome
i
begin
to
understand
why
the
medical
center
has
failed
to
get
anywhere
with
mekstrom
in
the
past
twenty
years
what
do
you
mean
he
snapped
merely
that
it
is
the
duty
of
all
scientists
to
listen
to
every
suggestion
and
to
discard
it
only
after
it
has
been
shown
wrong
such
as
he
said
coldly
with
a
curl
of
his
eyebrows
well
just
for
instance
suppose
some
way
were
found
to
keep
a
victim
alive
during
the
vital
period
so
that
he
would
end
up
a
complete
mekstrom
human
the
idea
is
utterly
fantastic
we
have
no
time
for
such
idle
speculation
there
is
too
much
foggy
thinking
in
the
world
already
why
only
last
week
we
had
a
velikovsky
adherent
tell
us
that
mekstrom
had
been
predicted
in
the
bible
there
are
still
people
reporting
flying
saucers
you
know
we
have
no
time
for
foolish
notions
or
utter
nonsense
may
i
quote
you
of
course
not
he
snapped
stiffly
i
merely
pointing
out
that
persons
can
not
have
the
grasp
the
door
opened
again
and
a
second
man
entered
the
new
arrival
had
pleasant
blue
eyes
a
van
dyke
beard
and
a
air
of
and
competence
may
i
cut
in
he
said
to
sprague
certainly
cornell
this
is
scholar
phelps
director
of
the
center
scholar
phelps
this
is
steve
cornell
a
gentleman
of
the
press
he
added
in
a
tone
of
voice
that
made
the
identification
a
sort
of
nasty
name
cornell
has
an
odd
theory
about
mekstrom
disease
that
he
intends
to
publish
unless
we
can
convince
him
that
it
is
not
possible
odd
theory
asked
scholar
phelps
with
some
interest
well
if
cornell
can
come
up
with
something
new
i
be
most
happy
to
hear
him
out
lyon
sprague
decamped
with
alacrity
scholar
phelps
smiled
after
him
then
turned
to
me
and
said
sprague
is
a
diligent
worker
businesslike
and
but
he
lacks
the
imagination
and
the
sense
of
humor
that
makes
a
man
brilliant
in
research
unfortunately
sprague
can
not
abide
anything
that
is
not
laid
out
as
neat
as
an
interlocking
tile
floor
now
cornell
how
about
this
theory
of
yours
first
i
replied
i
like
to
know
how
come
you
turn
up
in
the
nick
of
time
he
laughed
we
always
send
sprague
out
to
interview
visitors
if
the
visitor
can
be
turned
away
easily
all
is
well
and
quiet
sprague
can
do
the
job
with
ease
but
if
the
visitor
like
yourself
cornell
proposes
something
that
distresses
the
good
sprague
and
will
not
be
loftily
dismissed
sprague
blood
pressure
goes
up
we
all
keep
a
bit
of
esper
on
his
nervous
system
and
when
the
fuse
begins
to
blow
we
come
out
and
effect
a
double
rescue
i
laughed
with
him
apparently
the
medical
center
staff
enjoyed
needling
sprague
scholar
phelps
before
i
get
into
my
theory
i
like
to
know
more
about
mekstrom
disease
i
may
not
be
able
to
use
it
in
my
article
but
any
background
material
works
well
with
writers
of
fact
articles
you
quite
right
what
would
you
like
to
know
i
heard
too
many
times
that
no
one
knows
anything
at
all
about
mekstrom
this
is
unbelievable
considering
that
you
folks
have
been
working
on
it
for
some
twenty
years
he
nodded
we
have
some
but
it
precious
little
it
seems
to
me
that
you
could
analyze
the
flesh
he
smiled
we
have
the
state
of
analytical
chemistry
is
well
advanced
we
could
i
think
take
a
dry
scraping
out
of
the
cauldron
used
by
macbeth
witches
and
determine
whether
shakespeare
had
reported
the
formula
correctly
now
young
man
if
you
think
that
something
is
added
to
the
human
flesh
to
make
it
mekstrom
flesh
you
are
wrong
standard
analysis
shows
that
the
flesh
is
composed
of
exactly
the
same
chemicals
that
normal
flesh
contains
in
the
same
proportion
nothing
is
added
as
for
instance
in
the
case
of
calcification
then
what
is
the
difference
the
difference
lies
in
the
structure
by
crystallographic
method
we
have
determined
that
mekstrom
flesh
is
a
formation
interlocked
tightly
scholar
phelps
looked
at
me
thoughtfully
do
you
know
much
about
crystallography
as
a
mechanical
engineer
i
did
but
as
a
writer
of
magazine
articles
i
felt
i
should
profess
some
ignorance
so
i
merely
said
that
i
knew
a
little
about
the
subject
well
cornell
you
may
know
that
in
the
field
of
solid
geometry
there
are
only
five
possible
regular
polyhedrons
like
the
laws
of
topology
that
state
that
no
more
than
four
colors
need
be
used
to
print
a
map
on
a
flat
surface
or
that
no
more
than
seven
colors
are
required
to
print
separate
patches
on
a
toroid
the
laws
of
solid
geometry
prove
that
no
more
than
five
regular
polyhedrons
are
possible
now
in
crystallography
there
are
only
possible
classes
of
crystal
lattice
construction
of
these
only
thirty
have
ever
been
discovered
in
nature
yet
we
know
how
the
other
two
would
appear
if
they
did
emerge
in
natural
formation
i
knew
it
all
right
but
i
made
scribblings
in
my
notebooks
as
if
the
idea
were
of
interest
scholar
phelps
waited
patiently
until
i
made
the
notation
now
cornell
here
comes
the
shock
mekstrom
flesh
is
one
of
the
other
two
classes
this
was
news
to
me
and
i
blinked
then
his
face
faded
into
a
solemn
expression
unfortunately
he
said
in
a
low
voice
knowing
how
a
crystal
should
form
does
not
help
us
much
in
forming
one
to
that
class
we
have
no
real
control
over
the
arrangement
of
atoms
in
a
crystal
lattice
we
can
prevent
the
crystal
formation
we
can
control
the
size
of
the
crystal
as
it
forms
but
we
can
not
change
the
crystal
into
some
other
class
i
suppose
it
sort
of
like
baking
a
cake
once
the
ingredients
are
mixed
the
cake
can
be
big
or
small
or
shaped
to
fit
the
pan
or
you
can
spoil
it
complete
but
if
you
mix
devil
food
it
either
comes
out
devil
food
or
nothing
an
amusing
analogy
and
rather
correct
however
i
prefer
the
one
used
years
ago
by
willy
ley
who
observed
that
analysis
is
fine
but
you
ca
learn
how
a
locomotive
is
built
by
melting
it
down
and
analyzing
the
mess
then
he
went
on
again
to
get
back
to
mekstrom
disease
and
what
we
know
about
it
we
know
that
the
crawl
goes
at
about
a
of
an
inch
per
hour
if
for
instance
you
turned
up
here
with
a
trace
on
your
right
middle
finger
the
entire
first
joint
would
be
mekstrom
flesh
in
approximately
three
days
within
two
weeks
your
entire
middle
finger
would
be
solid
without
anesthesia
we
could
take
a
saw
and
cut
off
a
bit
for
our
research
no
feeling
none
whatever
the
joints
knit
together
the
arteries
become
as
hard
as
steel
tubing
and
the
heart
can
not
function
properly
not
that
the
heart
cares
about
minor
conditions
such
as
the
arteries
in
the
extremities
but
as
the
mekstrom
infection
crawls
up
the
arm
toward
the
shoulder
the
larger
arteries
become
solid
and
then
the
heart
can
not
drive
the
blood
through
them
in
its
accustomed
fashion
it
gets
like
an
advanced
case
of
arteriosclerosis
eventually
the
infection
reaches
and
immobilizes
the
shoulder
this
takes
about
ninety
days
by
this
time
the
other
extremities
have
also
become
infected
and
the
crawl
is
coming
up
all
four
limbs
he
looked
at
me
very
solemnly
at
that
the
rest
is
not
pretty
death
comes
shortly
after
that
i
can
almost
say
that
he
is
blessed
who
catches
mekstrom
in
the
left
hand
for
them
the
infection
reaches
the
heart
before
it
reaches
other
parts
those
whose
initial
infection
is
in
the
toes
are
particularly
cursed
because
the
infection
reaches
the
lower
parts
of
the
body
i
believe
you
can
imagine
the
result
elimination
is
prevented
because
of
the
stoppage
of
peristalsis
death
comes
of
autointoxication
which
is
slow
and
painful
i
shuddered
at
the
idea
the
thought
of
death
has
always
bothered
me
the
idea
of
looking
at
a
hand
and
knowing
that
i
was
going
to
die
by
the
calendar
seemed
particularly
horrible
taking
the
bit
between
my
teeth
i
said
scholar
phelps
i
been
wondering
whether
you
and
your
center
have
ever
considered
treating
mekstrom
by
helping
it
helping
it
he
asked
sure
consider
what
a
man
might
be
if
he
were
mekstrom
all
the
way
through
he
nodded
you
would
have
a
physical
superman
he
said
muscles
driving
flesh
covered
by
a
near
impenetrable
skin
perhaps
such
a
man
would
be
free
of
all
minor
pains
and
ills
imagine
a
normal
bacterium
trying
to
bore
into
flesh
as
hard
as
concrete
mekstrom
flesh
tends
to
be
as
well
as
tough
physically
it
is
not
beyond
the
imagination
to
believe
that
your
mekstrom
superman
might
live
three
times
our
frail
and
ten
but
here
he
paused
not
to
pull
down
your
house
of
cards
this
idea
is
not
a
new
one
some
years
ago
we
invited
a
brilliant
young
doctor
here
to
study
for
his
scholarate
the
unfortunate
fellow
arrived
with
the
first
traces
of
mekstrom
in
his
right
middle
toe
we
placed
about
a
hundred
of
our
most
brilliant
researchers
under
his
guidance
and
he
decided
to
take
this
particular
angle
of
study
he
failed
for
all
his
efforts
he
did
not
stay
his
death
by
a
single
hour
from
that
time
to
the
present
we
have
maintained
one
group
on
this
part
of
the
problem
it
occurred
to
me
at
that
moment
that
if
i
turned
up
with
a
trace
of
mekstrom
i
be
seeking
out
the
highways
in
hiding
rather
than
the
medical
center
that
fast
thought
brought
a
second
suppose
that
thorndyke
learned
that
he
had
a
trace
or
rather
the
highways
found
it
out
what
better
way
to
augment
their
medical
staff
than
to
approach
the
victim
with
a
proposition
you
help
us
work
with
us
and
we
will
save
your
life
that
of
course
led
to
the
next
idea
that
if
the
highways
in
hiding
had
any
honest
motive
they
not
be
hidden
in
the
first
place
and
they
have
taken
their
cure
to
the
medical
center
in
the
second
well
i
had
a
bit
of
something
listed
against
them
so
i
decided
to
let
my
bombshell
drop
scholar
phelps
i
said
quietly
one
of
the
reasons
i
am
here
is
that
i
have
fairly
good
evidence
that
the
cure
for
mekstrom
disease
does
exist
and
that
it
produces
people
of
ultrahard
bodies
and
superhuman
strength
he
smiled
at
me
with
the
same
tolerant
air
that
father
uses
on
the
offspring
who
comes
up
with
one
of
the
standard
juvenile
plans
for
perpetual
motion
what
do
you
consider
good
evidence
suppose
i
claimed
to
have
seen
it
myself
then
i
would
say
that
you
had
misinterpreted
your
evidence
he
replied
calmly
the
flying
saucer
enthusiasts
still
insist
that
the
things
they
see
are
piloted
by
little
green
men
from
venus
even
though
we
have
been
there
and
found
venus
to
be
absolutely
uninhabited
by
anything
higher
than
slugs
grubs
and
little
globby
animals
like
tellurian
leeches
but
this
too
is
an
old
story
he
told
me
with
a
whimsical
smile
it
goes
with
the
standard
routine
about
a
secret
organization
that
is
intending
to
take
over
the
earth
the
outline
has
been
popular
ever
since
charles
fort
now
er
just
tell
me
what
you
saw
i
concocted
a
tale
that
was
about
percent
true
and
the
rest
partly
distorted
it
covered
my
hitting
a
girl
in
ohio
with
my
car
hard
enough
to
clobber
her
but
when
i
stopped
to
help
her
she
got
up
and
ran
away
unhurt
she
had
left
a
trace
of
blood
although
the
front
fender
of
the
car
was
badly
smashed
he
nodded
solemnly
such
things
happen
he
said
the
human
body
is
really
quite
durable
now
and
then
comes
the
lucky
happenstance
when
the
fearful
accident
does
no
more
than
raise
a
slight
bruise
i
read
the
story
of
the
man
whose
parachute
did
not
open
and
who
lived
to
return
it
to
the
factory
in
person
according
to
the
old
joke
but
now
cornell
have
you
ever
considered
the
utter
impossibility
of
running
any
sort
of
secret
organization
in
this
world
of
today
even
before
rhine
it
was
difficult
you
be
adding
to
your
tale
next
some
sort
of
secret
sign
maybe
a
form
of
fraternity
grip
or
perhaps
even
a
system
of
local
clubs
and
hangouts
all
aimed
at
some
dire
purpose
i
squirmed
nervously
for
a
bit
scholar
phelps
was
too
close
to
the
truth
to
make
me
like
it
because
he
was
scoffing
he
went
right
on
making
me
nervous
now
before
we
get
too
deep
i
only
want
to
ask
about
the
probable
motives
of
such
an
organization
you
grant
them
superhuman
strength
perhaps
extreme
longevity
if
they
wanted
to
take
over
the
earth
could
they
do
it
by
a
show
of
force
or
are
they
supermen
only
quietly
interested
in
overrunning
the
human
race
and
waiting
out
the
inevitable
decline
of
normal
homo
sapiens
you
not
endowing
them
with
extraterrestrial
origin
are
you
i
shook
my
head
unhappily
good
that
shows
some
logic
cornell
after
all
we
know
now
that
while
we
could
live
on
mars
or
venus
with
a
lot
of
aid
be
most
uncomfortable
there
we
could
not
live
a
minute
on
any
planet
of
our
solar
system
without
artificial
help
i
might
point
out
that
our
hypothetical
superman
might
be
able
to
stand
a
lot
of
rough
treatment
i
blurted
oh
this
i
grant
if
your
tale
held
any
water
at
all
but
forget
this
fruitless
conjecture
and
take
a
look
at
the
utter
impossibility
of
running
such
an
organization
even
planting
all
of
their
secret
hangouts
in
dead
areas
and
never
going
into
urban
centers
they
still
find
some
telepath
or
esper
on
their
trail
perhaps
a
team
let
go
back
a
step
and
consider
even
without
psi
training
how
long
such
an
outfit
could
function
it
would
run
until
the
first
specimen
had
an
automobile
accident
on
say
times
square
or
until
one
of
them
walked
or
ran
out
of
the
fire
following
a
jetliner
crash
he
then
spared
me
with
a
cold
eye
write
it
as
fiction
cornell
but
leave
my
name
out
of
it
i
thought
you
were
after
facts
i
am
but
the
better
fact
articles
always
use
a
bit
of
speculation
to
liven
it
up
well
he
grunted
one
such
fanciful
suggestion
is
the
possibility
of
such
an
underground
outfit
being
able
to
develop
a
while
we
can
not
we
who
have
had
the
best
of
brains
and
money
for
twenty
years
i
nodded
and
while
i
did
not
agree
with
phelps
i
knew
that
to
insist
was
to
insult
him
to
his
face
and
get
myself
tossed
out
you
do
seem
to
have
quite
a
here
i
said
at
this
point
phelps
offered
to
show
me
around
the
place
and
i
accepted
medical
center
was
far
larger
than
i
had
believed
at
first
it
spread
beyond
my
esper
range
into
the
hills
beyond
the
main
plant
the
buildings
were
arranged
in
a
pattern
out
in
the
back
section
i
say
looking
because
only
a
person
can
dig
a
pattern
the
psi
area
did
not
extend
for
miles
behind
the
main
buildings
it
closed
down
into
the
usual
mottled
pattern
and
the
medical
buildings
had
been
placed
in
the
open
areas
dwellings
and
dormitories
were
in
the
dark
places
a
nice
i
did
not
meet
any
of
the
patients
but
phelps
let
me
stand
in
the
corridor
outside
a
couple
of
rooms
and
use
my
esper
on
the
flesh
it
was
both
distressing
and
instructive
he
explained
the
usual
thing
after
someone
visits
this
way
is
that
the
visitor
goes
out
itching
in
medical
circles
this
is
a
form
of
what
we
call
syndrome
ever
heard
of
it
i
nodded
that
during
the
first
years
at
knowing
all
too
little
of
medicine
every
disease
they
study
produces
the
same
symptoms
that
the
student
finds
in
himself
until
tomorrow
when
they
study
the
next
then
the
symptoms
in
the
student
change
right
so
in
order
to
prevent
syndrome
among
visitors
we
usually
let
them
study
the
real
thing
also
he
added
seriously
like
to
have
as
many
people
as
possible
recognize
the
real
thing
as
early
as
possible
even
though
we
ca
do
anything
for
them
at
the
present
time
someday
we
will
he
stopped
before
a
closed
door
in
here
is
a
girl
of
eighteen
doomed
to
die
in
a
month
his
voice
trailed
off
as
he
tapped
on
the
door
of
the
room
i
froze
a
few
beads
of
cold
sweat
ran
down
my
spine
and
i
fought
myself
into
a
state
of
nervous
calmness
i
put
the
observation
away
buried
it
as
deep
as
i
could
tried
to
think
around
it
and
so
far
as
i
knew
succeeded
the
tap
of
scholar
phelps
finger
against
the
door
panel
was
the
sound
characteristic
of
leather
tapping
wood
scholar
phelps
was
a
mekstrom
i
paid
only
surface
attention
to
the
rest
of
my
visit
i
thanked
my
personal
gods
that
esper
training
had
also
given
me
the
ability
to
dissemble
it
was
impossible
to
not
think
of
something
but
it
is
possible
to
keep
the
mind
so
busy
with
surface
thoughts
that
the
underlying
idea
does
not
come
through
the
interference
eventually
i
managed
to
leave
the
medical
center
without
exciting
anyone
and
when
i
left
i
took
off
like
a
skyrocket
for
chicago
vii
nurse
gloria
farrow
waved
at
me
from
the
ramp
of
the
jetliner
and
i
ran
forward
to
collect
her
baggage
she
eyed
me
curiously
but
said
no
more
than
the
usual
greetings
and
indication
of
which
bag
was
hers
i
knew
that
she
was
reading
my
mind
like
a
psychologist
all
the
time
and
i
let
her
know
that
i
wanted
her
to
i
let
my
mind
merely
ramble
on
with
the
usual
pile
of
irrelevancies
that
the
mind
uses
to
fill
in
blank
spaces
it
came
up
with
a
couple
of
notions
here
and
there
but
nothing
definite
miss
farrow
followed
me
to
my
car
without
saying
a
word
and
let
me
install
her
luggage
in
the
trunk
then
for
the
first
time
she
spoke
steve
cornell
you
as
healthy
as
i
am
i
admit
it
then
what
is
this
all
about
you
do
need
a
nurse
i
need
a
competent
witness
miss
farrow
for
what
she
looked
puzzled
suppose
you
stay
right
here
and
start
explaining
you
listen
to
the
bitter
end
i
two
hours
before
the
next
plane
goes
back
you
have
that
time
to
convince
me
or
else
okay
that
a
deal
i
fumbled
around
for
a
beginning
and
then
i
decided
to
start
right
at
the
beginning
whether
it
sounded
cockeyed
or
not
giving
information
to
a
telepath
is
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
while
i
started
at
the
beginning
i
fumbled
and
finally
ended
up
by
going
back
and
forth
in
a
haphazard
manner
but
miss
farrow
managed
to
insert
the
trivia
in
the
right
chronological
order
so
that
when
i
finished
she
nodded
with
interest
i
posed
the
question
am
i
nuts
no
steve
she
replied
solemnly
i
do
think
so
you
managed
to
accept
data
which
is
obviously
mingled
truth
and
falsehood
and
managed
to
question
the
validity
of
all
of
it
i
grunted
how
about
the
crazy
man
who
questions
his
own
sanity
using
this
personal
question
as
proof
of
his
sanity
since
real
nuts
they
sane
no
nut
can
think
that
deep
into
complication
what
i
mean
is
that
they
can
not
even
question
their
own
sanity
in
the
first
premise
of
postulated
argument
but
forget
that
what
i
wanted
to
know
is
where
you
intend
to
go
from
here
i
shook
my
head
unhappily
when
i
called
you
i
had
it
all
laid
out
like
a
roadmap
i
was
going
to
show
you
proof
and
use
you
as
an
impartial
observer
to
convince
someone
else
then
we
go
to
the
medical
center
and
hand
it
to
them
on
a
platter
since
then
i
had
a
shock
that
i
ca
get
over
or
plan
beyond
scholar
phelps
is
a
mekstrom
that
means
that
the
guy
knows
what
gives
with
mekstrom
disease
and
yet
he
is
running
an
outfit
that
professes
to
be
helpless
in
the
face
of
this
disease
for
all
we
know
phelps
may
be
the
head
of
the
highways
in
hiding
an
organization
strictly
for
profit
of
some
sort
at
the
expense
of
the
public
welfare
you
certain
that
phelps
is
a
mekstrom
not
absolutely
positive
i
had
to
close
my
mind
because
there
might
be
a
telepath
on
tap
but
i
can
tell
you
that
nobody
with
normal
fingers
ever
made
that
solid
rap
a
fingernail
i
shook
my
head
at
her
that
a
click
with
an
ear
at
all
you
note
the
difference
i
accept
it
for
the
moment
but
lacking
your
original
plan
what
are
you
going
to
do
now
i
not
sure
beyond
showing
you
the
facts
maybe
i
should
call
up
that
team
that
called
on
me
after
thorndyke
disappearance
and
put
it
in
their
laps
good
idea
but
why
would
scholar
phelps
be
lying
and
beyond
your
basic
suspicions
what
can
you
prove
very
little
i
admit
that
my
evidence
is
extremely
thin
i
saw
phillip
harrison
turning
head
bolts
on
a
tractor
engine
with
a
small
end
wrench
it
should
require
a
crossbar
socket
and
a
lot
of
muscle
next
is
the
girl
in
ohio
who
should
be
a
bloody
mess
from
the
way
she
was
treated
instead
she
got
up
and
tried
to
chase
me
then
answer
me
a
puzzler
did
the
harrisons
move
because
marian
caught
mekstrom
or
did
they
move
because
they
felt
that
i
was
too
close
to
discovering
their
secret
the
highway
was
relocated
after
that
you
recall
it
sounds
frightfully
complicated
steve
you
bet
it
does
i
grunted
so
next
i
meet
a
guy
who
is
supposed
to
know
all
the
answers
a
man
dedicated
to
the
public
welfare
medicine
and
the
ideal
of
service
a
man
sworn
to
the
hippocratic
oath
or
i
went
on
bitterly
is
it
the
hypocritic
oath
steve
please
please
hell
i
stormed
why
is
he
quietly
sitting
there
in
mekstrom
hide
while
he
is
overtly
grieving
over
the
painful
death
of
his
fellow
man
i
would
know
well
i
tired
of
being
pushed
around
i
growled
pushed
around
she
asked
quietly
with
a
trace
of
scorn
i
said
miss
farrow
i
can
see
two
possible
answers
either
i
am
being
pushed
around
for
some
deliberate
reason
or
i
too
smart
too
cagey
and
too
dangerous
for
them
to
handle
directly
it
takes
only
about
eight
weeks
for
me
to
reluctantly
abandon
the
second
in
favor
of
the
first
but
what
makes
you
think
you
are
being
pushed
she
wanted
to
know
you
ca
tell
me
that
i
am
so
important
that
they
could
erase
me
as
easily
as
they
did
catherine
and
thorndyke
and
now
that
his
name
comes
up
let
ask
why
any
doctor
who
once
met
a
casual
patient
would
go
to
the
bother
of
sending
a
postcard
with
a
message
on
it
that
is
certain
to
cause
me
unhappiness
he
also
the
guy
who
nudged
me
by
calling
my
attention
to
my
hallucination
about
father
harrison
lifting
my
car
while
phillip
harrison
raced
into
the
fire
to
make
the
rescue
add
it
up
i
told
her
sharply
next
he
is
invited
to
medical
center
to
study
mekstrom
only
instead
of
landing
there
he
sends
me
a
postcard
with
one
of
the
highways
in
the
picture
after
which
he
disappears
miss
farrow
nodded
thoughtfully
it
is
all
tied
up
with
your
highways
and
your
mekstrom
people
that
is
all
i
said
how
come
the
harrisons
moved
so
abruptly
you
posing
questions
that
i
ca
answer
complained
miss
farrow
and
i
not
one
hundred
percent
convinced
that
you
are
right
you
are
here
and
if
you
take
a
look
at
what
i
show
you
you
be
convinced
we
put
it
this
way
to
start
something
cockeyed
is
going
on
now
one
more
thing
i
can
add
and
this
is
the
part
that
confuses
me
everything
that
has
been
done
seems
to
point
to
me
so
far
as
i
can
see
they
are
operating
just
as
though
they
want
me
to
start
a
big
hassle
that
will
end
up
by
getting
the
highways
out
of
their
hiding
why
on
earth
would
they
be
doing
that
she
wanted
to
know
i
do
have
the
foggiest
notion
but
i
do
have
that
feeling
and
there
is
evidence
pointing
that
way
they
let
me
in
on
things
that
normally
they
be
able
to
conceal
from
a
highly
trained
telepath
so
i
intend
to
go
along
with
them
because
somewhere
at
the
bottom
of
it
all
we
find
the
answer
she
nodded
agreement
now
i
started
up
the
car
saying
i
going
to
find
us
one
of
the
highways
in
hiding
and
we
follow
it
to
one
of
the
way
stations
then
you
see
for
yourself
that
there
is
something
definitely
fishy
going
on
this
i
like
to
see
she
replied
quietly
almost
too
quietly
i
took
a
dig
at
her
as
i
turned
the
car
out
through
a
tight
corner
of
the
lot
onto
the
road
she
was
sitting
there
with
a
noncommittal
expression
on
her
face
and
i
wondered
why
she
replied
to
my
thought
steve
you
must
face
one
thing
anything
you
firmly
believe
will
necessarily
pass
across
your
mind
as
fact
so
forgive
me
if
i
hold
a
few
small
doubts
until
i
have
a
chance
to
survey
some
of
the
evidence
at
first
hand
sure
i
told
her
the
first
bit
wo
be
hard
i
drove
eagerly
across
illinois
into
iowa
watching
for
road
signs
i
knew
that
once
i
convinced
someone
else
it
would
be
easier
to
convince
a
third
and
a
fourth
and
a
fiftieth
until
the
entire
world
was
out
on
the
warpath
we
drove
all
day
stopping
for
chow
now
and
then
behaving
like
a
couple
out
on
a
vacation
tour
we
stopped
in
a
small
town
along
about
midnight
and
found
a
hotel
without
having
come
upon
any
of
the
hidden
highways
we
met
at
breakfast
talked
our
ideas
over
mildly
and
took
off
again
we
crossed
into
nebraska
about
noon
and
continued
to
meander
until
late
in
the
afternoon
when
we
came
upon
our
first
giveaway
road
sign
there
i
told
her
triumphantly
she
nodded
i
see
the
sign
steve
that
much
i
knew
now
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
show
me
the
up
in
that
emblem
unless
they
changed
their
method
i
told
her
this
one
leads
west
slightly
south
of
i
stopped
the
car
not
many
yards
from
the
sign
and
went
over
it
with
my
sense
of
perception
you
note
the
ease
with
which
the
emblem
could
be
turned
upside
down
i
interjected
note
the
similar
width
of
the
top
and
bottom
trefoil
so
that
only
a
trained
and
interested
observer
can
tell
the
i
drove
along
until
we
saw
one
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
and
we
stopped
again
giving
the
sign
a
thorough
going
over
note
that
the
signs
leading
away
from
the
direction
are
upside
down
i
went
on
i
did
say
a
word
i
was
using
every
ounce
of
energy
in
running
my
perception
over
the
sign
and
commenting
on
its
various
odds
and
ends
now
i
finished
we
drive
along
this
highway
in
hiding
until
we
come
to
some
intersection
or
hideout
then
you
be
she
was
silent
we
took
off
along
that
road
rather
fast
and
we
followed
it
for
miles
passing
sign
after
sign
with
its
emblem
turned
up
along
the
right
side
of
the
road
and
turned
when
the
sign
was
on
the
left
eventually
we
came
to
a
crossing
highway
and
at
that
i
pointed
triumphantly
note
the
missing
spoke
i
said
with
considerable
enthusiasm
now
miss
farrow
we
shall
first
turn
against
it
for
a
few
miles
and
then
we
shall
and
come
back
along
the
cross
highway
with
it
i
beginning
to
be
convinced
steve
we
turned
north
against
the
sign
and
went
forty
or
fifty
miles
just
to
be
sure
the
signs
were
all
against
us
eventually
i
turned
into
a
gas
station
and
filled
the
carte
up
to
the
scuppers
as
we
turned
back
south
i
asked
her
any
more
comment
she
shook
her
head
not
yet
i
nodded
if
you
want
we
take
a
jaunt
along
our
original
course
by
all
means
in
other
words
you
are
more
than
willing
to
be
convinced
yes
she
said
simply
she
went
silent
then
and
i
wondered
what
she
was
thinking
about
but
she
did
bother
to
tell
me
eventually
we
came
back
to
the
crossroad
and
with
a
feeling
of
having
been
successful
i
continued
south
with
a
confidence
that
i
had
not
felt
before
we
stopped
for
dinner
in
a
small
town
ate
hastily
but
well
and
then
had
a
very
mild
debate
shall
we
have
a
drink
and
relax
for
a
moment
i
like
it
she
replied
honestly
but
somehow
i
doubt
that
i
could
relax
i
know
but
it
does
seem
like
a
good
idea
to
take
it
easy
for
a
half
hour
it
might
even
be
better
if
we
stopped
over
and
took
off
again
in
the
morning
steve
she
told
me
the
only
way
i
could
relax
or
go
to
sleep
would
be
to
take
on
a
roaring
load
so
that
i
pass
out
cold
i
rather
not
because
i
get
up
tomorrow
with
a
most
colossal
hangover
frankly
excited
and
i
prefer
to
follow
this
thing
to
a
finish
it
a
deal
i
said
we
go
until
we
have
to
stop
it
was
about
eight
when
we
hit
the
road
again
by
we
covered
something
better
than
two
hundred
miles
followed
another
intersection
turn
according
to
the
missing
spoke
and
were
heading
well
toward
the
upper
corner
of
colorado
on
the
road
map
at
ten
plus
a
few
minutes
we
came
upon
the
roadsign
that
pointed
the
way
to
a
house
set
prettily
on
the
top
of
a
small
knoll
several
hundred
yards
back
from
the
main
road
i
stopped
briefly
a
few
hundred
feet
from
the
road
and
asked
miss
farrow
what
your
telepath
range
you
never
told
me
she
replied
instantly
intense
concentration
directed
at
me
is
about
a
half
mile
superficial
thinking
that
might
include
me
or
my
personality
as
a
about
five
hundred
yards
to
pick
up
a
thought
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
me
or
my
interests
not
much
more
than
a
couple
of
hundred
feet
things
that
are
definitely
none
of
my
business
close
down
to
forty
or
fifty
feet
that
was
about
the
average
for
a
person
with
a
bit
of
psi
training
either
in
telepathy
or
in
esper
it
matched
mine
fairly
well
excepting
that
part
about
things
that
were
none
of
my
business
she
meant
and
not
i
had
always
had
a
hard
time
differentiating
between
things
that
were
none
of
my
damned
business
although
i
do
find
it
more
difficult
to
dig
the
contents
of
a
letter
between
two
unknown
parties
at
a
given
distance
than
it
is
to
dig
a
letter
written
or
addressed
to
a
person
i
know
are
by
and
large
a
lot
less
personal
than
thoughts
if
i
saying
anything
new
well
i
told
her
this
is
it
we
going
to
go
in
close
enough
for
you
to
take
a
keep
your
mind
sensitive
if
you
dig
any
danger
yell
out
i
going
to
extend
my
esper
as
far
as
i
can
and
if
i
suddenly
take
off
like
a
startled
spacecraft
it
because
i
have
uncovered
something
disagreeable
but
keep
your
mind
on
them
and
not
me
because
i
relying
on
you
to
keep
posted
on
their
mental
angle
miss
farrow
nodded
it
hard
to
remember
that
other
people
have
the
ability
to
make
contact
mentally
it
like
a
normal
man
talking
to
a
blind
man
and
referring
constantly
to
visible
things
because
he
understand
i
try
to
remember
i
going
to
back
in
i
said
then
if
trouble
turns
up
i
have
an
advantage
as
soon
as
they
feel
our
minds
coming
in
at
them
know
that
we
not
in
there
for
their
health
so
here
we
go
i
a
good
actor
she
said
no
matter
what
i
say
i
with
you
all
the
way
i
yanked
the
car
forward
and
angled
back
i
hit
the
road
easily
and
started
backing
along
the
driveway
at
a
rather
fast
speed
with
my
eyes
to
give
my
esper
sense
the
full
benefit
of
my
concentration
along
the
road
when
i
was
not
concentrating
on
how
i
was
going
to
turn
the
wheel
at
the
next
curve
i
thought
i
hope
these
folks
know
the
best
way
to
get
to
colorado
springs
from
here
dammit
we
lost
miss
farrow
squeezed
my
arm
gently
letting
me
know
that
she
was
thinking
the
same
general
thoughts
suddenly
she
said
it
a
dead
area
steve
it
was
a
dead
area
all
right
my
perception
came
to
a
barrier
that
made
it
fade
from
full
perception
to
not
being
able
to
perceive
anything
in
a
matter
of
yards
it
always
gives
me
an
eerie
feeling
when
i
approach
a
dead
area
and
find
that
i
can
see
a
building
clearly
and
not
be
able
to
cast
my
perception
beyond
a
few
feet
i
kept
on
backing
up
into
the
fringe
of
that
dead
area
until
i
was
deep
within
the
edge
and
it
took
all
my
concentration
to
perceive
the
road
a
few
feet
ahead
of
my
rear
wheels
so
that
i
could
steer
i
was
inching
now
coming
back
like
a
blind
man
feeling
his
way
we
were
within
about
forty
feet
of
the
ranch
house
when
miss
farrow
yelped
they
surrounding
us
steve
my
hands
whipped
into
action
and
my
heavy
right
foot
came
down
on
the
the
car
shuddered
howled
like
a
wounded
banshee
and
then
leaped
forward
with
a
roar
a
man
sprang
out
of
the
bushes
and
stood
in
front
of
the
car
like
a
statue
with
his
hand
held
up
miss
farrow
screamed
something
unintelligible
and
clutched
at
my
arm
frantically
i
threw
her
hand
off
with
a
snarl
kept
my
foot
rammed
down
hard
and
hit
the
man
dead
center
the
car
bucked
and
i
heard
metal
crumple
angrily
we
lurched
bounced
viciously
twice
as
my
wheels
passed
over
his
floundering
body
and
then
we
were
racing
like
complete
idiots
along
a
road
that
should
not
have
been
covered
at
more
than
twenty
the
main
road
came
into
sight
and
i
sliced
the
car
around
with
a
screech
of
the
rear
tires
controlled
the
deliberate
skid
with
some
fancy
and
some
fast
digging
of
the
surrounding
dangers
then
we
were
tearing
along
the
broad
and
beautifully
clear
concrete
with
the
speedometer
needle
running
into
the
region
steve
said
miss
farrow
breathlessly
that
man
you
hit
in
a
hard
voice
i
said
he
was
getting
to
his
feet
when
i
drove
out
of
range
i
know
she
said
in
a
whimper
i
was
in
his
mind
he
was
not
hurt
god
steve
what
are
we
up
against
her
voice
rose
to
a
wail
i
do
know
exactly
i
said
but
i
know
what
we
going
to
do
but
steve
what
can
we
do
alone
or
together
very
little
but
we
can
bring
one
person
more
out
along
these
highways
and
then
convince
a
fourth
and
a
fifth
and
a
fiftieth
and
a
thousandth
by
then
we
be
shoved
back
off
the
stage
while
the
big
wheels
grind
painfully
slow
but
exceedingly
meticulous
that
take
time
certainly
but
we
got
a
start
look
how
long
it
took
getting
a
start
in
the
first
place
but
what
is
their
purpose
she
asked
that
i
ca
say
i
ca
say
a
lot
of
things
like
how
and
why
and
wherefore
but
i
know
that
now
we
have
a
front
tooth
in
this
affair
we
not
going
to
let
go
i
thought
for
a
moment
i
could
use
thorndyke
he
be
the
next
guy
to
convince
if
we
could
find
him
or
maybe
catherine
if
we
could
find
her
the
next
best
thing
is
to
get
hold
of
that
team
that
called
on
me
there
a
pair
of
characters
that
seem
willing
to
sift
through
a
million
tons
of
ash
to
find
one
valuable
cinder
they
listen
i
miss
farrow
looked
at
her
watch
i
dug
it
as
she
made
the
gesture
eleven
going
to
call
she
asked
no
i
said
it
too
late
it
one
in
new
york
now
and
the
team
would
be
ready
for
a
fast
job
at
this
hour
so
i
have
no
intention
of
placing
a
you
are
ready
call
to
a
number
identified
with
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
not
when
a
full
eight
hours
must
elapse
between
the
call
and
a
reply
too
much
can
happen
to
us
in
the
meantime
but
if
i
call
in
the
morning
we
can
probably
take
care
of
ourselves
well
enough
until
they
arrive
if
we
stay
in
some
place
that
is
positively
teeming
with
citizens
sensible
sounds
reasonable
steve
i
let
the
matter
drop
at
that
i
put
the
down
to
the
floor
and
fractured
a
lot
of
speed
laws
until
we
came
to
denver
we
made
denver
just
before
midnight
and
drove
around
until
we
located
a
hotel
that
filled
our
needs
it
was
large
which
would
prevent
overt
operations
on
the
part
of
the
and
it
was
a
dead
area
which
would
prevent
one
of
them
from
reading
our
minds
while
we
slept
and
so
enable
them
to
lay
counterplans
against
us
the
bellhop
gave
us
a
knowing
leer
as
we
registered
separately
but
i
was
content
to
let
him
think
what
he
wanted
better
that
he
get
the
wrong
idea
about
us
than
the
right
one
he
fiddled
around
in
miss
farrow
room
on
the
ninth
bucking
for
a
big
tip
not
for
good
service
but
for
leaving
us
alone
which
he
did
by
demonstrating
how
big
a
nuisance
he
could
be
if
not
properly
rewarded
but
finally
he
got
tired
of
his
and
and
and
escorted
me
up
to
the
twelfth
i
led
him
out
with
a
five
spot
clutched
in
his
fist
and
the
leer
even
stronger
if
he
expected
me
to
race
downstairs
as
soon
as
he
was
out
of
he
was
mistaken
for
i
hit
the
sack
like
the
proverbial
ton
of
crushed
mortar
it
had
been
literally
weeks
since
i
had
a
pleasant
restful
sleep
that
was
not
broken
by
fitful
dreams
and
now
that
we
had
something
solid
to
work
on
i
could
look
forward
to
some
concrete
action
instead
of
merely
feeling
pushed
around
viii
i
put
in
for
an
eight
call
but
my
sleep
had
been
so
sound
and
perfect
that
i
was
all
slept
out
by
i
was
anxious
to
get
going
so
i
dressed
and
shaved
in
a
hurry
and
cancelled
the
eight
call
then
i
asked
the
operator
to
connect
me
with
a
gruff
angry
male
voice
snarled
out
of
the
earpiece
at
me
i
began
to
apologize
profusely
but
the
other
guy
slammed
the
phone
down
on
the
hook
hard
enough
to
make
my
ear
ring
i
jiggled
my
hook
angrily
and
when
the
operator
answered
i
told
her
that
she
miscued
she
listened
to
my
complaint
and
then
replied
in
a
pettish
tone
but
i
did
ring
sir
i
try
again
i
wanted
to
tell
her
to
just
try
that
there
was
no
about
it
but
i
did
i
tried
to
dig
through
the
murk
to
her
switchboard
but
i
could
dig
a
foot
through
this
area
i
waited
impatiently
until
she
the
connections
at
her
switchboard
and
i
heard
the
burring
of
the
phone
as
the
other
end
rang
then
the
same
voice
delivered
a
number
of
pointed
comments
about
people
who
ring
up
honest
citizens
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
he
hung
up
again
in
the
middle
of
my
apology
i
got
irked
again
and
demanded
that
the
operator
connect
me
with
the
registration
clerk
to
him
i
told
my
troubles
one
moment
sir
he
said
a
half
minute
later
he
returned
with
sorry
sir
there
is
no
farrow
registered
could
i
have
you
no
goddammit
i
snarled
it
farrow
f
as
in
frank
a
as
in
arthur
double
r
as
in
robert
robert
o
as
in
oliver
and
w
as
in
washington
i
saw
her
register
i
went
with
her
and
the
bellhop
to
her
room
number
and
saw
her
installed
then
the
same
took
me
up
to
my
room
in
on
the
twelfth
there
was
another
moment
of
silence
then
he
said
you
cornell
registered
in
room
last
night
approximately
four
minutes
after
midnight
i
know
all
about
me
i
was
there
and
did
it
myself
and
if
i
registered
at
four
after
midnight
miss
farrow
must
have
registered
about
two
after
midnight
because
the
ink
was
still
wet
on
her
card
when
i
wrote
my
name
we
came
in
together
we
were
travelling
together
now
what
gives
i
would
know
sir
we
have
no
guest
named
farrow
see
here
i
snapped
did
you
ever
have
a
guest
named
farrow
not
in
the
records
i
have
available
at
this
desk
perhaps
in
the
past
there
may
have
been
forget
the
past
what
about
the
character
in
the
registration
clerk
returned
and
informed
me
coldly
room
has
been
occupied
by
a
horace
westfield
for
over
three
months
cornell
there
is
no
mistake
his
voice
sounded
professionally
sympathetic
and
i
knew
that
he
would
forget
my
troubles
as
soon
as
his
telephone
was
put
back
on
its
hook
forget
it
i
snapped
and
hung
up
angrily
then
i
went
towards
the
elevators
walking
in
a
sort
of
daze
there
was
a
cold
lump
of
something
concrete
hard
beginning
to
form
in
the
pit
of
my
stomach
wetness
ran
down
my
spine
and
a
drop
of
sweat
dropped
from
my
armpit
and
hit
my
body
a
few
inches
above
my
belt
like
a
pellet
of
icy
hail
my
face
felt
cold
but
when
i
wiped
it
with
the
palm
of
a
shaking
hand
i
found
it
beaded
with
an
oily
sweat
everything
seemed
unreally
horrifying
nine
i
told
the
elevator
operator
in
a
voice
that
sounded
far
away
and
hoarse
i
wondered
whether
this
might
not
be
a
very
vivid
dream
and
maybe
if
i
went
all
the
way
back
to
my
room
took
a
short
nap
and
got
up
to
start
all
over
again
i
would
awaken
to
honest
reality
the
elevator
stopped
at
nine
and
i
walked
the
corridor
that
was
familiar
from
last
night
i
rapped
on
the
door
of
room
the
door
opened
and
a
big
gorilla
gazed
out
and
snarled
at
me
are
you
the
persistent
character
look
i
said
patiently
last
night
a
woman
friend
of
mine
registered
at
this
hotel
and
i
accompanied
her
to
this
door
number
now
a
long
apelike
arm
came
out
and
caught
me
by
the
coat
lapels
he
hauled
and
i
went
in
fast
his
breath
was
sour
and
his
eyes
were
bloodshot
and
he
was
angry
all
the
way
through
his
other
hand
caught
me
by
the
seat
of
the
pants
and
he
danced
me
into
the
room
like
a
jumping
jack
friend
he
ground
out
take
a
look
there
ai
no
woman
in
this
room
see
he
whirled
carrying
me
off
my
feet
he
took
a
lunging
step
forward
and
hurled
me
onto
the
bed
where
i
carried
the
springs
deep
down
to
bounce
up
and
off
and
forward
to
come
up
flat
against
the
far
wall
i
landed
sort
of
flat
and
seemed
to
hang
there
before
i
slid
down
the
wall
to
the
floor
with
a
whump
then
before
i
could
collect
my
wits
or
myself
he
came
over
the
bed
in
one
long
leap
and
had
me
hauled
upright
by
the
coat
lapels
again
the
other
hand
was
cocked
back
level
with
his
shoulder
it
looked
the
size
of
a
pound
sack
of
flour
and
was
probably
as
hard
as
set
cement
i
told
myself
time
you
in
for
it
all
right
i
said
as
apologetically
as
i
knew
how
so
i
made
a
bad
mistake
i
apologize
i
also
admit
that
you
could
wipe
up
the
hotel
with
me
but
do
you
have
to
prove
it
horace
westfield
mental
processes
were
not
slow
cumbersome
and
crude
he
was
as
fast
and
hard
on
his
mental
feet
as
he
was
on
his
physical
feet
he
made
some
remarks
about
my
intelligence
my
upbringing
my
parentage
and
its
legal
status
and
my
unwillingness
to
face
a
superior
enemy
during
this
catalog
of
my
virtueless
existence
he
me
to
the
door
and
opened
it
he
concluded
his
lecture
by
suggesting
that
in
the
future
i
accept
anything
that
any
registration
clerk
said
as
truth
and
if
i
then
held
any
doubts
i
should
take
them
to
the
police
then
he
hurled
me
out
of
the
room
by
just
sort
of
shoving
me
away
i
sailed
across
the
hall
on
my
toes
backward
and
slapped
my
frame
flat
again
and
once
more
i
hung
against
the
wall
until
the
kinetic
energy
had
spent
itself
then
i
landed
on
wobbly
ankles
as
the
door
to
room
came
closed
with
a
violent
slam
i
cursed
the
habit
of
building
hotels
in
dead
areas
although
i
admitted
that
i
steer
clear
of
any
hotel
in
a
clear
area
myself
but
i
need
a
clear
area
nor
a
sense
of
perception
to
inform
me
that
room
was
absolutely
and
totally
devoid
of
any
remote
sign
of
female
habitation
in
fact
i
gathered
the
impression
that
for
all
of
his
brute
strength
and
virile
masculinity
horace
westfield
had
entertained
a
woman
in
that
room
since
he
been
there
there
was
one
other
certainty
it
was
impossible
for
any
agency
short
of
sheer
fairyland
magic
to
have
produced
overnight
a
room
that
displayed
its
occupancy
by
a
character
that
distinctive
sour
smell
takes
a
long
time
to
permeate
the
furnishings
of
any
decent
hotel
i
wondered
why
a
joint
as
well
kept
as
this
one
would
put
up
with
a
bird
as
careless
of
his
person
as
horace
westfield
so
i
came
to
the
reluctant
conclusion
that
room
was
not
occupied
by
nurse
farrow
but
i
was
not
yet
convinced
that
she
was
totally
missing
from
the
premises
instead
of
taking
the
elevator
i
took
to
the
stairs
and
tried
the
eighth
my
perception
was
not
too
good
for
much
in
this
murk
but
i
was
mentally
sensitive
to
nurse
farrow
and
if
i
could
get
close
enough
to
her
i
might
be
able
to
perceive
some
trace
of
her
even
through
the
deadness
i
put
my
forehead
against
the
door
of
room
and
drew
a
blank
i
could
dig
no
farther
than
the
inside
of
the
door
if
farrow
were
in
i
could
dig
a
trace
of
her
so
i
went
to
and
tried
there
i
was
determined
to
try
every
room
on
every
floor
but
as
i
was
standing
with
my
forehead
against
the
door
to
room
someone
came
up
behind
me
quietly
and
asked
in
a
rough
voice
just
what
do
you
think
you
doing
mister
his
dress
indicated
housedick
but
of
course
i
could
dig
the
license
in
his
wallet
any
more
than
he
could
read
my
mental
none
of
your
business
flatfoot
i
said
i
looking
for
a
friend
you
better
come
with
me
he
said
flatly
there
been
complaints
yeah
i
growled
maybe
i
made
one
of
them
myself
want
to
start
something
he
snapped
i
shrugged
and
he
smiled
it
was
a
stony
smile
humorless
as
a
crevasse
in
a
he
kept
that
smile
on
his
face
until
we
reached
the
manager
office
the
manager
was
out
but
one
of
the
assistant
managers
was
in
his
desk
the
little
sign
on
the
desk
said
henry
walton
assistant
manager
walton
said
coldly
what
seems
to
be
the
trouble
mr
cornell
i
decided
to
play
it
just
as
though
i
were
back
at
the
beginning
again
last
night
i
explained
very
carefully
i
checked
into
this
hotel
i
was
accompanied
by
a
woman
companion
a
registered
nurse
miss
gloria
farrow
she
registered
first
and
we
were
taken
by
one
of
your
bellboys
to
rooms
and
respectively
i
went
with
miss
farrow
to
and
saw
her
enter
then
the
bellhop
escorted
me
to
and
left
me
for
the
night
this
morning
i
can
find
no
trace
of
miss
farrow
anywhere
in
this
fleabag
he
bristled
at
the
derogatory
title
but
he
covered
it
quickly
please
be
assured
that
no
one
connected
with
this
hotel
has
any
intention
of
confusing
you
mr
cornell
i
tired
of
playing
games
i
snapped
i
accept
your
statement
so
far
as
the
management
goes
but
someone
is
guilty
of
fouling
up
your
registration
lists
that
rather
harsh
he
replied
coldly
falsifying
or
tampering
with
hotel
registration
lists
is
illegal
what
you
just
said
amounts
to
libel
or
slander
you
know
not
if
it
true
i
half
expected
henry
walton
to
backwater
fast
but
instead
he
merely
eyed
me
with
the
same
expression
of
distaste
that
he
might
have
used
upon
finding
half
of
a
fuzzy
caterpillar
in
his
green
salad
as
cold
as
a
cake
of
carbon
dioxide
snow
he
said
can
you
prove
this
mr
cornell
your
night
crew
you
given
us
a
bit
of
trouble
this
morning
he
informed
me
so
i
taken
the
liberty
of
calling
in
the
night
crew
for
you
he
pressed
a
button
and
a
bunch
came
in
and
lined
up
as
if
for
formal
inspection
boys
said
walton
quietly
suppose
you
tell
us
what
you
know
about
cornell
arrival
here
last
night
they
nodded
their
heads
in
unison
wait
a
minute
i
snapped
i
want
a
reliable
witness
to
listen
to
this
in
fact
if
i
could
i
like
to
have
their
stories
made
under
oath
you
like
to
register
a
formal
charge
perhaps
of
kidnapping
or
maybe
illegal
restraint
just
get
me
an
impartial
witness
i
told
him
sourly
very
well
he
picked
up
his
telephone
and
spoke
into
it
we
waited
a
few
minutes
and
finally
a
very
prim
young
woman
came
in
she
was
followed
by
a
uniformed
policeman
she
was
carrying
one
of
those
silent
typewriters
which
she
set
up
on
its
little
stand
with
a
few
efficient
motions
miss
mason
is
our
certified
public
stenographer
he
said
officer
i
want
your
signature
on
her
copy
when
we
finished
this
is
a
simple
routine
matter
but
it
must
be
legal
to
the
satisfaction
of
cornell
now
boys
go
ahead
and
explain
give
your
name
and
position
first
for
miss
mason
record
it
was
then
that
i
noticed
that
the
night
crew
had
arranged
themselves
in
chronological
order
the
elderly
gent
spoke
first
he
been
the
night
doorman
but
now
he
was
stripped
of
his
admiral
gold
braid
and
he
looked
just
like
any
other
sleepy
man
of
middle
age
george
comstock
he
announced
doorman
as
soon
as
i
saw
the
car
angling
out
of
traffic
i
pressed
the
for
a
bell
boy
peter
wright
came
out
and
was
standing
in
readiness
by
the
time
car
came
to
a
stop
by
the
curb
johnny
olson
was
out
next
and
after
peter
had
taken
cornell
bag
johnny
got
into
cornell
car
and
took
off
for
the
hotel
garage
walton
interrupted
let
each
man
tell
what
he
did
himself
no
prompting
please
well
then
you
heard
my
part
in
it
johnny
olson
took
off
in
cornell
car
and
peter
wright
took
off
with
cornell
bag
and
cornell
followed
peter
the
next
man
in
line
at
a
nod
from
the
assistant
manager
stepped
forward
about
a
half
a
pace
and
said
i
johnny
olson
i
followed
peter
wright
out
of
the
door
and
after
peter
had
collected
bag
i
got
in
cornell
car
and
took
it
to
the
hotel
garage
the
third
was
peter
wright
the
bellhop
i
carried
his
bag
to
the
desk
and
waited
until
he
registered
then
we
went
up
to
room
i
opened
the
door
lit
the
lights
opened
the
window
and
stuff
cornell
tipped
me
five
bucks
and
i
left
him
there
alone
i
thomas
boothe
the
elevator
operator
i
took
cornell
and
peter
wright
to
the
twelfth
peter
said
i
should
wait
because
he
would
be
long
and
so
i
waited
on
the
twelfth
until
peter
got
back
that
all
i
doris
caspary
the
night
telephone
operator
cornell
called
me
about
fifteen
minutes
after
twelve
and
asked
me
to
put
him
down
for
a
call
at
eight
this
morning
then
he
called
at
about
seven
thirty
and
said
that
he
was
already
awake
and
not
to
bother
henry
walton
said
that
about
it
mr
cornell
but
the
policeman
looked
puzzled
what
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
if
to
witness
any
statements
like
these
i
have
to
know
what
for
walton
looked
at
me
i
could
afford
not
to
answer
wearily
i
said
last
night
i
came
in
here
with
a
woman
companion
and
we
registered
in
separate
rooms
she
went
into
and
i
waited
until
she
was
installed
and
then
went
to
my
own
room
on
the
twelfth
this
morning
there
is
no
trace
of
her
i
went
on
to
tell
him
a
few
more
details
but
the
more
i
told
him
the
more
he
lifted
his
eyebrows
done
any
drinking
he
asked
me
curtly
no
certain
absolutely
walton
looked
at
his
crew
they
burst
into
a
chorus
of
well
he
steady
on
his
feet
and
he
did
under
the
influence
and
a
lot
of
other
statements
all
generally
indicating
that
for
all
they
knew
i
could
have
been
gassed
to
the
ears
but
one
of
those
rare
guys
who
do
show
it
the
policeman
smiled
thinly
just
why
was
this
registered
nurse
travelling
with
you
i
gave
them
the
statement
the
one
about
the
accident
and
that
i
felt
that
i
was
still
a
bit
on
the
rocky
side
and
so
forth
about
all
i
did
for
that
was
to
convince
the
policeman
that
i
was
not
a
stable
character
his
attitude
seemed
to
indicate
that
any
man
travelling
with
a
nurse
must
either
be
physically
sick
or
maybe
mentally
out
of
tune
then
with
a
sudden
thought
i
whirled
on
johnny
olson
will
you
get
my
car
i
asked
him
he
nodded
after
a
nod
from
walton
i
said
plenty
of
evidence
in
my
car
in
the
meantime
let
face
one
thing
officer
i
been
accused
of
spinning
a
yarn
i
hardly
be
demanding
witnesses
if
i
were
telling
the
truth
i
was
standing
beside
miss
farrow
when
she
signed
the
register
complete
with
the
title
too
bad
that
hotels
have
taken
to
using
card
files
instead
of
the
old
registration
book
cards
are
so
easy
to
misplace
walton
cut
in
angrily
if
that
an
accusation
i
inclined
to
see
that
you
make
it
in
a
court
of
law
the
policeman
looked
calm
i
take
it
easy
cornell
your
story
is
not
corroborated
but
the
employees
of
the
hotel
bear
one
another
out
and
from
the
record
it
would
appear
that
you
were
under
the
eyes
of
at
least
two
of
them
from
the
moment
your
car
slowed
down
in
front
of
the
main
entrance
up
to
the
time
that
you
were
escorted
to
your
room
i
object
to
being
accused
of
complicity
in
a
kidnapping
put
in
the
assistant
manager
i
object
to
being
accused
of
mental
incompetence
i
snapped
why
do
we
stand
around
accusing
people
back
and
forth
when
there
evidence
if
you
only
uncover
it
we
stood
there
glaring
at
one
another
the
air
grew
tense
the
only
ones
in
the
place
who
did
not
have
chips
on
their
shoulders
were
the
policeman
and
the
certified
stenographer
who
was
clicking
her
silent
keys
in
lightning
manner
taking
down
every
comment
as
it
was
uttered
eventually
olson
returned
to
put
an
end
to
the
thick
silence
outside
he
told
me
angrily
fine
i
said
now
we
go
outside
and
take
a
look
you
find
plenty
of
traces
of
miss
farrow
having
been
there
officer
are
you
telepath
or
perceptive
perceptive
he
said
but
not
in
here
how
far
out
does
this
damned
dead
area
extend
i
asked
walton
about
half
way
across
the
sidewalk
okay
so
let
all
go
we
traipsed
out
to
the
curb
miss
mason
brought
her
little
silent
along
slipping
the
stand
high
up
so
that
she
could
type
from
an
erect
position
we
lined
up
along
the
curb
and
i
looked
into
my
car
with
a
triumphant
feeling
and
then
that
cold
chill
congealed
my
spine
again
my
car
was
clean
and
shining
it
had
been
washed
and
buffed
and
polished
until
it
looked
as
new
as
the
day
i
picked
it
out
on
the
salesroom
floor
walton
looked
blank
and
i
whipped
a
thought
at
him
damned
telepath
he
nodded
perceptibly
and
said
smoothly
i
rather
sorry
we
find
any
fingerprints
because
now
you
see
and
here
he
turned
to
the
policeman
and
went
on
cornell
will
now
accuse
us
of
having
washed
his
car
to
destroy
the
evidence
however
you
find
that
as
a
general
policy
of
the
hotel
the
is
performed
as
a
standard
service
in
fact
if
any
guest
parks
his
car
in
our
garage
and
his
car
is
not
rendered
spick
and
span
someone
is
going
to
get
fired
for
negligence
so
that
was
that
i
took
a
fast
look
around
because
i
knew
that
i
had
to
get
out
of
there
fast
if
i
remained
to
carry
on
any
more
argument
i
be
tapped
for
being
a
nuisance
and
jugged
i
had
no
doubt
at
all
that
the
whole
hotel
staff
were
all
involved
in
nurse
farrow
disappearance
but
they
done
their
job
in
such
a
way
that
if
the
question
were
pushed
hard
i
would
end
up
answering
formal
charges
the
topmost
of
which
might
be
murder
and
concealment
of
the
body
i
could
do
nothing
by
sitting
in
jail
this
was
the
time
to
get
out
first
and
worry
about
farrow
later
so
i
opened
the
car
door
and
slipped
in
i
fiddled
with
the
glove
compartment
and
opened
it
the
maps
were
all
neatly
stacked
and
all
the
flub
had
been
cleaned
out
i
fumbled
inside
and
dropped
a
couple
of
road
maps
to
the
floor
and
while
i
was
down
picking
them
up
i
turned
the
ignition
key
which
olson
had
left
plugged
in
the
lock
i
took
off
with
a
jerk
and
howl
of
tires
there
was
the
sudden
shrill
of
a
police
whistle
but
it
was
stopped
after
one
brief
blast
as
i
turned
the
corner
i
caught
a
fast
backwards
dig
at
them
they
were
filing
back
into
the
hotel
i
did
not
believe
that
the
policeman
was
part
of
the
conspiracy
but
i
was
willing
to
bet
that
walton
was
going
to
slip
the
policeman
a
box
of
fine
cigars
as
a
reward
for
having
helped
them
to
get
rid
of
a
very
embarrassing
screwball
ix
i
put
a
lot
of
miles
between
me
and
my
recent
adventure
before
i
stopped
to
take
stock
the
answer
to
the
mess
was
still
obscure
but
the
elimination
of
nurse
farrow
fell
into
the
pattern
very
neatly
alone
i
was
no
problem
so
long
as
my
actions
were
restricted
to
meandering
up
and
down
the
highways
and
byways
peering
into
nooks
and
crannies
and
crying
catherine
in
a
plaintive
voice
no
one
cared
but
when
i
teamed
up
with
a
telepath
they
moved
in
with
the
efficiency
of
a
machine
and
extracted
the
disturbing
element
in
fact
their
machinations
had
been
so
smooth
that
i
was
beginning
to
believe
that
my
were
really
an
assortment
of
unimportant
facts
shown
to
me
deliberately
for
some
reason
of
their
own
the
only
snag
in
the
latter
theory
was
the
fact
of
our
accident
assuming
that
i
had
to
get
involved
in
the
mess
there
were
easier
ways
to
introduce
me
than
by
planning
a
bad
that
could
have
been
fatal
even
granting
the
close
proximity
of
the
harrison
tribe
to
come
to
the
rescue
the
accident
had
to
be
an
accident
in
the
dictionary
definition
of
the
word
itself
under
the
circumstances
a
planned
accident
could
only
be
accepted
under
an
entirely
different
set
of
conditions
for
instance
let
assume
that
catherine
was
a
mekstrom
and
i
was
about
to
disclose
the
fact
then
she
or
they
could
plan
such
an
accident
knowing
that
she
could
walk
out
of
the
wreck
with
her
hair
barely
mussed
leaving
me
dead
for
sure
but
catherine
was
not
a
mekstrom
i
been
close
enough
to
that
satin
skin
to
know
that
the
body
beneath
it
was
soft
and
yielding
yet
the
facts
as
they
stood
did
not
throw
out
my
theory
it
merely
had
to
be
revised
catherine
was
no
mekstrom
but
if
the
harrisons
had
detected
the
faintest
traces
of
an
incipient
mekstrom
infection
they
could
very
well
have
taken
her
in
i
fumed
at
the
idea
i
could
almost
visualize
them
pointing
out
her
infection
and
then
informing
her
bluntly
that
she
could
either
swear
in
with
them
and
be
cured
or
she
could
die
alone
and
miserably
this
could
easily
explain
her
disappearance
naturally
being
what
they
were
they
cared
nothing
for
me
or
any
other
i
was
no
menace
not
until
i
teamed
up
with
a
telepath
and
they
knew
what
to
do
about
that
completely
angry
i
decided
that
it
was
time
that
i
made
a
noise
like
an
erupting
volcano
with
plans
forming
i
took
off
again
towards
yellowstone
pausing
only
long
enough
at
fort
collins
to
buy
some
armament
colorado
is
still
a
part
of
the
united
states
where
a
man
can
go
into
a
store
and
buy
a
gun
over
the
counter
just
like
any
other
tool
i
picked
out
a
bonanza
because
it
is
small
enough
to
fit
the
hip
pocket
light
because
of
the
new
alloys
so
it
would
unballast
me
and
mostly
because
it
packs
enough
wallop
to
stop
a
charging
hippo
i
did
not
know
whether
it
would
drill
all
the
way
through
a
mekstrom
hide
but
the
impact
would
at
least
set
any
target
back
on
the
seat
of
his
pants
then
i
drove
into
wyoming
and
made
my
way
to
yellowstone
and
one
day
i
was
driving
along
the
same
road
that
had
been
pictured
in
thorndyke
postcard
i
drove
along
it
boldly
loaded
for
bear
and
watching
the
highway
signs
that
led
me
nicely
toward
my
goal
eventually
i
came
to
the
inevitable
missing
spoke
it
pointed
to
a
establishment
that
lay
sprawled
out
in
a
billow
of
dead
area
i
eyed
it
warily
and
kept
on
driving
because
my
plans
did
not
include
marching
up
to
the
front
door
like
a
rug
peddler
instead
i
went
on
to
the
next
town
some
twenty
miles
away
which
i
reached
about
dark
i
stopped
for
a
leisurely
dinner
saw
a
moving
picture
at
the
killed
a
few
at
the
bar
and
started
back
to
the
way
station
about
midnight
the
name
dug
from
the
mailbox
was
macklin
again
i
did
not
turn
in
i
parked
the
car
down
the
highway
by
about
three
miles
figuring
that
only
a
psi
of
doctor
degree
would
be
able
to
dig
anything
at
that
distance
i
counted
on
there
being
no
such
mental
giant
in
this
out
of
the
way
place
i
made
my
way
back
toward
the
ranch
house
across
the
fields
and
among
the
rolling
rock
i
extended
my
perception
as
far
as
i
could
i
made
myself
sensitive
to
danger
and
covered
the
ground
foot
by
foot
digging
for
traps
alarm
lines
photocell
trips
and
parties
who
might
be
lying
in
wait
for
me
i
encountered
no
sign
of
any
trip
or
trap
all
the
way
to
the
fringe
of
the
dead
zone
the
possibility
that
they
knew
of
my
presence
and
were
comfortably
awaiting
me
deep
within
the
zone
occurred
to
me
and
so
i
was
very
cautious
as
i
cased
the
layout
and
decided
to
make
my
entry
at
the
point
where
the
irregular
boundary
of
the
dead
area
was
closest
to
the
house
itself
i
entered
and
became
completely
starlight
cast
just
enough
light
so
that
i
could
see
to
walk
without
falling
into
a
chuck
hole
or
stumbling
over
something
but
beyond
a
few
yards
everything
lost
shape
and
became
a
murky
blob
the
night
was
dead
silent
except
for
an
occasional
hiss
of
wind
through
the
brush
esperwise
i
was
not
covering
much
more
than
my
eyes
could
see
i
stepped
deeper
into
the
zone
and
lost
another
yard
of
perception
i
kept
probing
at
the
murk
sort
of
like
poking
a
finger
at
a
hanging
blanket
it
moved
if
i
dug
hard
enough
in
any
direction
but
as
soon
as
i
released
the
pressure
the
murk
moved
right
back
where
it
was
before
i
crouched
and
took
a
few
more
steps
into
the
zone
got
to
a
place
where
i
could
begin
to
see
the
outlines
of
the
house
itself
dark
silent
it
looked
uninhabited
i
wished
that
there
had
been
a
college
course
in
housebreaking
prowling
and
operations
i
went
at
it
very
slowly
i
took
my
sweet
time
crossing
the
boards
of
the
back
verandah
even
though
the
short
hair
on
the
back
of
my
neck
was
beginning
to
prickle
from
nervousness
i
was
also
scared
at
any
given
moment
they
had
the
legal
right
to
open
a
window
poke
out
a
and
blow
me
into
bloody
ribbons
where
i
stood
the
zone
was
really
a
dead
one
my
esper
range
was
no
more
than
about
six
inches
from
my
forehead
a
motion
picture
of
steve
cornell
sounding
out
the
border
of
a
window
with
his
forehead
would
have
looked
funny
it
was
not
funny
at
the
time
but
i
found
that
the
sash
was
not
locked
and
that
the
flyscreen
could
be
unshipped
from
the
outside
i
entered
a
dining
room
inside
it
was
blacker
than
pitch
i
crossed
the
dining
room
by
sheer
feel
and
instinct
and
managed
to
get
to
the
hallway
without
making
any
racket
at
this
point
i
stopped
and
asked
myself
what
the
heck
i
thought
i
was
trying
to
do
i
had
to
admit
that
i
had
no
plan
in
definite
form
i
was
just
prowling
the
joint
to
see
what
information
i
might
be
able
to
pick
up
down
the
hall
i
found
a
library
i
been
told
that
you
tell
what
kind
of
people
folks
are
by
inspecting
their
library
and
so
i
conned
the
book
titles
by
running
my
head
along
a
row
of
books
the
books
in
the
library
indicated
to
me
that
this
was
a
family
of
some
size
with
rather
broad
tastes
there
was
everything
from
science
fiction
to
shakespeare
everything
from
philosophy
to
adventure
a
short
row
of
kid
books
a
bible
encyclopedia
brittanica
published
in
chicago
in
volumes
but
there
were
no
places
that
were
worn
that
might
give
me
an
idea
as
to
any
special
interest
the
living
room
was
also
blank
of
any
evidence
of
anything
out
or
the
ordinary
i
turned
away
and
stood
in
the
hallway
blocked
by
indecision
i
was
a
fool
i
kept
telling
myself
because
i
did
not
have
any
experience
in
casing
a
joint
and
what
i
knew
had
been
studied
out
of
detective
tales
even
if
the
inhabitants
of
the
place
were
to
let
me
go
at
it
in
broad
daylight
i
not
too
sure
that
i
do
a
good
job
of
finding
something
of
interest
except
for
sheer
luck
but
on
the
other
hand
i
gotten
nowhere
by
dodging
and
ducking
i
was
in
no
mood
to
run
quivering
in
fear
i
was
more
inclined
to
emit
a
bellow
just
to
see
what
would
happen
next
so
instead
of
sneaking
quietly
away
i
found
the
stairs
and
started
to
go
up
very
slowly
it
occurred
to
me
at
about
the
third
step
that
i
must
be
right
anybody
with
any
sense
would
keep
anything
dangerous
in
their
downstairs
library
it
would
be
too
much
like
a
storing
his
nitro
in
the
liquor
cabinet
or
the
murderer
who
hangs
his
weapon
over
the
mantelpiece
yet
everybody
kept
some
sort
of
records
or
had
things
in
their
homes
that
were
not
shown
to
visiting
firemen
and
if
it
were
on
the
second
floor
then
it
might
be
in
the
cellar
if
i
were
caught
first
prowl
the
whole
damned
place
inch
by
inch
avoiding
if
possible
those
rooms
in
which
people
slept
the
fifth
step
squeaked
ever
so
faintly
but
it
sounded
like
someone
pulling
a
spike
out
of
a
packing
case
made
of
green
wood
i
froze
half
aching
for
some
perceptive
range
so
that
i
could
dig
any
sign
of
danger
and
half
remembering
that
if
it
were
for
the
dead
area
i
not
be
this
far
i
have
been
frightened
to
try
it
in
a
clear
zone
eventually
i
went
on
up
and
as
my
head
came
above
the
level
of
the
floor
everything
became
once
more
here
was
as
neat
a
bit
of
home
planning
as
i
have
ever
seen
just
below
the
level
of
the
second
floor
their
dead
area
faded
out
so
that
the
top
floor
was
clean
bright
and
clear
as
day
i
paused
startled
at
it
and
spent
a
few
moments
digging
outside
the
dead
area
billowed
above
the
rooftop
out
of
my
range
from
what
little
i
could
survey
of
the
dark
psi
area
it
must
have
been
shaped
sort
of
like
an
cake
except
that
the
central
hole
did
not
go
all
the
way
down
only
to
the
level
it
was
a
wonderful
for
a
home
privacy
was
granted
on
the
first
floor
and
from
the
road
and
all
the
surrounding
territory
but
on
the
second
floor
there
was
plenty
of
pleasant
esperclear
space
for
the
family
and
friends
their
dead
area
was
shaped
in
the
ideal
form
for
any
ideal
home
then
i
stopped
complimenting
the
architect
and
went
on
about
my
business
because
there
directly
in
front
of
my
nose
i
could
dig
the
familiar
impression
of
a
medical
office
i
went
the
rest
of
the
way
up
the
stairs
and
into
the
medical
office
there
was
no
mistake
the
usual
cabinets
full
of
instruments
a
laboratory
examination
table
shelves
of
little
bottles
and
along
one
wall
was
a
library
of
medical
books
all
it
needed
was
a
sign
on
the
door
macklin
msch
to
make
it
standard
at
the
end
of
the
library
was
a
set
of
looseleaf
notebooks
and
i
pulled
the
more
recent
of
them
out
and
held
it
up
to
my
face
i
did
not
dare
snap
on
a
light
so
i
had
to
go
it
esper
even
in
the
clear
area
this
told
me
very
little
esper
is
not
like
eyesight
any
more
than
you
can
hear
printed
words
or
perhaps
carry
on
a
conversation
by
watching
the
wiggly
green
line
on
an
oscilloscope
i
wished
it
was
instead
esper
gives
you
a
grasp
of
materials
and
shapes
and
things
in
position
with
regard
to
other
things
it
is
sort
of
like
seeing
something
simultaneously
from
all
sides
if
you
can
imagine
such
a
sensation
so
instead
of
being
able
to
the
journal
i
had
to
take
it
letter
by
letter
by
digging
the
shape
of
the
ink
on
the
page
with
respect
to
the
paper
and
the
other
letters
and
since
the
handwriting
was
atrocious
i
could
get
no
more
than
if
the
thing
were
written
in
latin
if
it
had
been
typewritten
or
with
a
stylized
hand
it
would
have
been
far
less
difficult
or
if
it
had
been
any
of
my
damned
business
i
could
have
dug
it
easily
but
as
it
was
looking
for
something
mr
cornell
asked
a
cool
voice
that
dripped
with
acid
sarcasm
at
the
same
instant
the
lights
went
on
i
whirled
clutched
at
my
hip
pocket
and
dropped
to
my
knees
at
the
same
time
the
sights
of
my
centered
in
the
middle
of
a
midriff
she
stood
there
indolently
disdainful
of
the
cannon
that
was
aimed
at
her
she
was
not
armed
i
have
caught
the
esper
warning
of
danger
if
she
come
at
me
with
a
weapon
of
some
sort
even
though
i
was
preoccupied
with
the
bookful
of
evidence
i
stood
up
and
faced
her
and
let
my
esper
run
lightly
over
her
body
she
was
another
mekstrom
which
did
not
surprise
me
a
bit
i
seem
to
have
found
what
i
was
looking
for
i
said
her
laugh
was
scornful
but
not
loud
you
welcome
mr
cornell
telepath
yes
and
a
good
one
who
else
is
awake
just
me
so
far
she
replied
quietly
but
i
be
glad
to
call
out
keep
it
quiet
sister
stop
thinking
like
an
idiot
cornell
quiet
or
not
you
not
leave
this
house
until
i
permit
you
to
go
i
let
my
esper
roam
quickly
through
the
house
an
elderly
couple
slept
in
the
front
bedroom
a
man
slept
alone
in
the
room
beside
them
a
pair
of
young
boys
slept
in
an
bunk
in
the
room
across
the
hall
the
next
room
must
have
been
hers
the
bed
was
tumbled
but
empty
the
room
next
to
the
medical
office
contained
a
man
trussed
in
traction
splints
white
bandages
and
literally
festooned
with
those
little
hanging
bottles
that
contain
everything
from
blood
plasma
to
food
and
water
right
on
down
to
lubrication
for
the
joints
i
tried
to
dig
his
face
under
the
swath
of
bandage
but
i
could
make
out
much
more
than
the
fact
that
it
was
a
face
and
that
the
face
was
half
mekstrom
flesh
he
is
a
mekstrom
patient
said
miss
macklin
quietly
at
this
stage
he
is
unconscious
i
sort
of
sneered
at
her
good
friend
of
yours
no
doubt
not
particularly
she
said
let
say
that
he
is
a
poor
victim
that
would
die
if
we
had
found
his
infection
early
the
tone
and
expression
of
her
voice
made
me
seethe
she
sounded
as
though
she
felt
herself
to
be
a
real
benefactor
to
the
human
race
and
that
she
and
her
outfit
would
do
the
same
for
any
other
poor
guy
that
caught
mekstrom
providing
they
learned
about
this
unfortunate
occurrence
in
time
we
would
mr
cornell
i
grunted
why
dispute
my
word
she
asked
in
the
same
tone
of
innocent
honesty
i
eyed
her
angrily
and
i
felt
my
hand
tighten
on
the
revolver
i
a
reason
to
become
suspicious
i
told
her
in
a
voice
that
i
hoped
was
as
as
her
own
because
three
people
have
disappeared
in
the
past
without
a
trace
but
under
circumstances
that
put
me
in
the
middle
all
of
them
somehow
seem
to
be
involved
with
your
hidden
road
sign
system
and
mekstrom
disease
that
unfortunate
she
said
quietly
i
had
to
grab
myself
to
keep
from
yelling
unfortunate
and
managed
to
muffle
it
down
to
a
mere
sound
people
dying
of
because
you
keeping
this
cure
a
secret
and
i
batted
from
pillar
to
post
because
i
gave
up
on
that
because
i
really
did
not
know
why
it
unfortunate
that
you
had
to
become
involved
she
said
firmly
because
you
it
unfortunate
for
everybody
i
snapped
because
i
going
to
bust
you
all
wide
open
i
afraid
not
you
see
in
order
to
do
that
you
have
to
get
out
of
here
and
that
i
will
not
permit
i
grunted
miss
macklin
you
mekstroms
have
hard
bodies
but
do
you
think
your
hide
will
stop
a
slug
from
this
you
never
know
you
see
cornell
you
do
not
have
the
cold
brittle
determined
guts
that
you
need
to
pull
that
trigger
no
pull
it
she
said
or
do
you
agree
now
that
you
of
age
that
you
ca
bluff
a
telepath
i
eyed
her
sourly
because
she
was
right
she
held
that
strength
that
lies
in
weakness
i
could
not
pull
that
trigger
and
fire
a
inch
slug
into
that
slender
midriff
and
opposite
that
miss
macklin
also
had
a
strength
that
was
strength
itself
she
could
hold
me
aloft
with
one
hand
kicking
and
squirming
while
she
was
twisting
my
arms
and
legs
off
with
her
other
hand
she
held
all
the
big
cards
of
her
sex
too
i
could
slug
her
with
my
fist
even
though
i
knew
that
i
only
break
my
hand
without
even
bruising
her
i
was
in
an
awkward
situation
and
i
knew
it
if
she
been
a
normal
woman
i
could
have
shrugged
my
way
past
her
and
left
but
she
was
determined
not
to
let
me
leave
without
a
lot
of
physical
violence
violence
committed
on
a
woman
gets
the
man
in
dutch
no
matter
how
justified
he
is
yet
in
my
own
weakness
there
was
a
strength
there
was
another
way
out
and
i
took
it
abruptly
and
without
forethought
x
shifting
my
aim
slightly
i
pulled
the
trigger
the
bonanza
went
off
with
a
sound
like
an
atom
bomb
in
a
telephone
booth
and
the
slug
whiffed
between
her
arm
and
her
body
and
drilled
a
crater
in
the
plaster
behind
her
the
roar
stunned
her
stiff
the
color
drained
from
her
face
and
she
swayed
uncertainly
i
found
time
enough
to
observe
that
while
her
body
was
as
hard
as
chromium
her
nervous
system
was
still
human
and
sensitive
enough
to
make
her
faint
from
a
sudden
shock
she
caught
herself
and
stood
there
stiff
and
white
with
one
delicate
but
hand
up
against
her
throat
then
i
dug
the
household
they
were
piling
out
of
the
hay
like
a
bunch
of
trained
firemen
answering
a
still
alarm
they
arrived
in
all
stages
of
nightdress
in
the
following
order
the
man
about
or
three
who
skidded
into
the
room
on
dead
gallop
and
put
on
brakes
with
a
screech
as
he
caught
sight
of
the
with
its
thin
wisp
of
blue
vapor
still
trailing
out
of
the
muzzle
the
twins
aged
about
fourteen
who
might
have
turned
to
run
if
not
been
frightened
stiff
at
the
sight
of
the
cannon
in
my
fist
father
and
then
mother
macklin
who
came
in
briskly
but
without
panic
macklin
said
crisply
may
i
have
an
explanation
mr
cornell
i
a
cornered
rat
i
said
thickly
and
so
i
scared
i
want
out
of
here
in
one
piece
i
so
scared
that
if
i
intercepted
i
may
get
panicky
and
if
i
do
someone
is
likely
to
get
hurt
understand
perfectly
said
macklin
calmly
are
you
going
to
let
him
get
away
with
this
snapped
the
eldest
son
fred
a
nervous
man
with
a
revolver
is
very
dangerous
especially
one
who
lacks
the
rudimentary
training
in
the
simpler
forms
of
burglary
i
could
help
but
admire
the
older
gentleman
bland
young
man
he
said
to
me
you
made
a
bad
mistake
no
i
have
i
snapped
i
been
on
the
trail
of
something
concrete
for
a
long
time
and
now
that
i
found
it
i
not
going
to
let
it
go
easily
i
waved
the
and
they
all
cringed
but
macklin
he
said
please
put
that
weapon
down
cornell
let
not
add
attempted
murder
to
your
other
crimes
do
force
me
to
it
then
get
out
of
my
way
and
let
me
go
he
smiled
i
do
have
to
be
telepath
to
tell
you
that
you
wo
pull
that
trigger
until
you
sorely
driven
he
replied
calmly
he
was
so
right
that
it
made
me
mad
he
added
also
you
got
four
shells
left
since
you
carry
the
firearm
on
an
empty
chamber
not
used
to
guns
are
you
mr
cornell
well
i
was
used
to
wearing
a
gun
now
that
he
mentioned
it
i
remembered
that
it
was
impossible
to
fire
the
shell
under
the
hammer
by
any
means
except
by
pulling
the
trigger
what
he
was
telling
me
meant
that
even
if
i
made
a
careful
but
bloody
sweep
of
it
with
my
four
shells
there
would
be
two
of
them
left
and
even
the
twins
were
more
than
capable
of
taking
me
apart
inch
by
inch
once
my
revolver
was
empty
seems
to
be
an
impasse
cornell
he
said
with
an
amused
smile
you
bunch
of
ah
now
please
he
said
abruptly
my
wife
is
not
accustomed
to
such
language
nor
is
my
daughter
although
my
son
and
the
twins
probably
know
enough
definitions
to
make
them
angry
this
is
an
impasse
cornell
and
it
behooves
all
of
us
to
be
extremely
polite
to
one
another
for
one
wrong
move
and
you
fire
this
will
mean
complete
chaos
for
all
of
us
one
wrong
word
from
you
and
someone
of
us
will
take
offense
which
will
be
equally
fatal
now
let
all
stand
quietly
and
talk
this
over
what
to
talk
over
i
demanded
a
truce
or
call
it
an
armistice
do
go
on
he
looked
at
his
family
and
i
followed
his
gaze
miss
macklin
was
leaning
against
the
wall
with
a
look
of
concentrated
interest
her
elder
brother
fred
was
standing
alert
and
ready
but
not
quite
poised
for
a
leap
macklin
had
a
smile
on
her
face
which
for
some
unknown
reason
she
was
aiming
at
me
in
a
disarming
manner
the
twins
were
standing
close
together
both
of
them
i
wondered
whether
they
were
esper
or
telepath
twins
are
always
the
same
when
they
identical
and
opposite
when
fraternal
the
thing
that
really
bothered
me
was
their
attitude
they
all
seemed
to
look
at
me
as
though
i
were
a
poor
misguided
individual
who
had
unwittingly
tromped
on
their
toes
after
having
fallen
in
among
bad
company
they
reminded
me
of
the
harrisons
who
looked
and
sounded
so
sympathetic
when
i
gone
out
there
seeking
catherine
a
fine
bunch
to
trust
first
they
swipe
my
girl
and
erase
all
traces
of
her
then
when
i
go
looking
they
offer
me
help
and
sympathy
for
my
distress
the
right
hand
giveth
and
the
left
hand
taketh
away
yeah
i
hated
them
all
yet
i
am
not
a
i
wanted
the
whole
highways
in
hiding
rolled
up
like
an
old
discarded
corridor
carpet
with
every
mekstrom
on
earth
rolled
up
in
it
but
even
if
i
been
filled
to
the
scuppers
with
in
favor
of
my
fellow
man
i
could
not
have
pulled
the
trigger
and
started
the
shambles
for
instead
of
blowing
the
whole
thing
wide
open
because
of
a
batch
of
bodies
the
survivors
would
have
enough
savvy
to
clean
up
the
mess
before
our
bodies
got
cold
and
the
old
highways
crowd
would
be
doing
business
at
the
same
old
stand
without
i
might
add
without
the
minor
nuisance
that
people
call
steve
cornell
what
i
really
wanted
was
to
find
catherine
and
then
it
came
to
me
that
what
i
really
wanted
second
of
all
was
to
possess
a
body
of
mekstrom
flesh
to
be
a
physical
superman
suppose
said
miss
macklin
unexpectedly
that
it
is
impossible
impossible
i
roared
what
have
you
got
that
i
have
got
mekstrom
disease
replied
miss
macklin
quietly
fine
i
sneered
so
how
do
i
go
out
and
get
it
you
get
it
naturally
or
not
at
all
she
said
now
see
here
i
started
off
but
macklin
stopped
me
with
an
upraised
hand
cornell
he
said
we
are
in
the
very
awkward
position
of
trying
to
convince
a
man
that
his
preconceived
notion
is
incorrect
we
can
produce
no
direct
evidence
to
support
our
statement
all
we
can
do
is
to
tell
you
that
so
far
as
we
know
and
as
much
as
we
know
about
disease
no
one
has
ever
contracted
the
infection
artificially
and
how
can
i
believe
you
that
our
awkward
position
we
can
not
show
you
anything
that
will
support
our
statement
we
can
profess
the
attitudes
of
honesty
truth
honor
altruism
and
every
other
word
that
means
the
same
thing
we
can
talk
until
doomsday
and
nothing
will
be
said
so
where
is
all
this
getting
us
i
asked
i
hope
it
is
beginning
to
cause
your
mind
to
doubt
the
preconceived
notion
he
said
ask
yourself
why
any
outfit
such
as
ours
would
deliberately
show
you
evidence
i
have
it
and
it
does
not
make
sense
he
smiled
precisely
it
does
not
fred
macklin
interrupted
look
dad
why
are
we
bothering
with
all
this
guff
because
i
have
hopes
that
cornell
can
be
made
to
see
our
point
to
join
as
it
were
our
side
fat
chance
i
snapped
please
i
your
elder
and
not
at
all
inclined
to
waste
my
time
you
came
here
seeking
information
and
you
shall
have
it
you
will
not
believe
it
but
it
will
i
hope
fill
in
some
blank
spots
after
you
have
had
a
chance
to
compare
sort
and
use
your
own
logic
on
the
problem
as
a
mechanical
engineer
you
are
familiar
with
the
line
of
reasoning
that
we
people
call
occam
razor
the
law
of
least
reaction
i
said
automatically
the
what
asked
macklin
miss
macklin
said
i
read
it
from
cornell
mind
mother
the
law
of
least
reaction
can
be
demonstrated
by
the
following
if
a
bucket
of
mixed
and
gasoline
are
heated
there
is
a
calculable
probability
that
the
gasoline
will
catch
fire
first
because
the
gasoline
is
easier
least
reaction
to
set
on
fire
right
i
said
but
how
does
this
apply
to
me
macklin
took
up
the
podium
again
for
one
thing
your
assumption
regarding
catherine
is
correct
at
the
time
of
the
accident
she
was
found
to
have
mekstrom
disease
in
its
earliest
form
the
harrisons
did
take
her
in
to
save
her
life
now
dropping
that
side
of
the
long
story
we
must
follow
your
troubles
the
accident
to
a
certain
group
of
persons
was
a
fortunate
one
it
placed
under
their
medical
care
a
man
you
in
whose
mind
could
be
planted
a
certain
mild
curiosity
about
a
peculiar
road
sign
and
other
evidences
the
upshot
of
this
was
that
you
took
off
on
a
tour
of
investigation
that
sounded
logical
but
there
were
a
lot
of
questions
that
had
open
ragged
ends
flying
loose
macklin
went
on
let
diverge
for
the
moment
cornell
what
is
your
reaction
to
mekstrom
disease
at
this
point
that
was
easy
it
was
a
curse
to
the
human
race
excepting
that
some
outfit
knew
how
to
cure
it
once
cured
it
made
a
physical
superman
of
the
victim
what
stuck
in
my
craw
was
the
number
of
unfortunate
people
who
caught
it
and
died
painfully
or
by
their
own
hand
in
horror
without
the
sign
of
aid
or
assistance
he
nodded
when
i
gone
about
through
my
conclusions
and
before
i
got
mentally
violent
about
them
cornell
you
expressed
your
own
doom
at
certain
hands
you
feel
that
the
human
race
could
benefit
by
exploitation
of
disease
it
could
if
everybody
helped
out
and
worked
together
everybody
he
asked
with
a
sly
look
i
yearned
again
for
the
ability
of
a
telepath
and
i
knew
that
the
reason
why
i
was
running
around
loose
was
because
i
was
only
an
esper
and
therefore
incapable
of
learning
the
truth
directly
i
stood
there
like
a
totem
pole
and
tried
to
think
eventually
it
occurred
to
me
just
as
there
are
people
who
can
not
stand
dictatorships
there
are
others
who
can
not
abide
democracy
in
any
aggregation
like
the
human
race
there
will
be
the
warped
souls
who
feel
superior
to
the
rest
of
humanity
they
welcome
dictatorships
providing
they
can
be
among
the
dictators
and
if
they
are
not
included
they
fight
until
the
other
dictatorship
is
deposed
so
that
they
can
take
over
true
said
macklin
and
yet
if
they
declared
their
intentions
how
long
would
they
last
not
very
long
not
until
they
had
enough
power
to
make
it
stick
i
said
and
above
all
not
until
they
have
the
power
to
grant
this
blessing
to
those
whose
minds
agree
with
theirs
so
now
cornell
i
make
a
statement
that
you
can
accept
as
a
mere
collection
of
words
to
be
used
in
your
arguments
with
yourself
we
assume
two
groups
one
working
to
set
up
a
hierarchy
of
mekstroms
in
which
the
rest
of
the
human
race
will
become
hewers
of
wood
and
drawers
of
water
contrasting
that
group
is
another
group
who
feels
that
no
man
or
even
a
congress
of
men
are
capable
of
picking
and
choosing
the
individual
who
is
to
be
granted
the
body
of
the
physical
superman
we
can
not
hope
to
watch
the
watchers
cornell
and
we
will
not
have
on
our
conscience
the
weight
of
having
to
select
a
over
b
as
being
more
desirable
enough
of
this
you
have
to
argue
it
out
by
yourself
later
later
grunted
fred
macklin
you
not
going
to
i
certainly
am
said
his
father
firmly
cornell
may
yet
be
the
agency
whereby
we
succeed
in
winning
out
he
spoke
to
me
again
neither
group
dares
to
come
into
the
open
cornell
we
can
not
accuse
the
other
group
of
anything
nefarious
any
more
than
they
dare
to
accuse
us
their
mode
of
attack
is
to
coerce
you
into
exposing
us
for
a
group
of
undercover
operators
who
are
making
supermen
look
i
asked
him
why
not
admit
it
you
got
nothing
sinister
in
mind
think
of
all
the
millions
of
people
who
have
not
had
schooling
beyond
the
preparatory
grades
he
said
people
of
latent
psi
ability
instead
of
trained
practice
or
those
poor
souls
who
have
no
psi
ability
worth
mentioning
do
you
know
the
history
of
the
rhine
institute
mr
cornell
only
vaguely
in
the
early
days
of
rhine
work
at
duke
university
there
were
many
scoffers
the
scoffers
and
detractors
naturally
enough
were
those
people
who
had
the
least
amount
of
psi
ability
admitting
that
at
the
time
all
psi
ability
was
latent
they
still
had
less
of
it
but
after
rhine
death
his
associates
managed
to
prove
his
theories
and
eventually
worked
out
a
system
of
training
that
would
develop
the
psi
ability
then
cornell
those
who
are
blessed
with
a
high
ability
in
telepathy
or
perception
the
common
term
of
esper
is
a
misnomer
you
know
because
there
nothing
about
perception
found
themselves
being
suspected
and
hated
by
those
who
had
not
this
delicate
sense
it
took
forty
of
fifty
years
before
common
public
acceptance
got
around
to
looking
at
telepathy
and
perception
in
the
same
light
as
they
saw
a
musician
with
a
trained
ear
or
an
artist
with
a
trained
eye
psi
is
a
talent
that
everybody
has
to
some
degree
and
today
this
is
accepted
with
very
little
angry
jealousy
but
now
he
went
on
thoughtfully
consider
what
would
happen
if
we
made
a
public
announcement
that
we
could
cure
mekstrom
disease
by
making
a
physical
superman
out
of
the
poor
victim
our
main
enemy
would
then
stand
up
righteously
and
howl
that
we
are
concealing
the
secret
he
would
be
believed
we
would
be
tracked
down
and
persecuted
eventually
wiped
out
while
he
sat
behind
his
position
and
went
on
picking
and
choosing
victims
whose
attitude
parallel
his
own
and
who
is
the
character
i
demanded
i
knew
but
i
wanted
him
to
say
it
aloud
he
shook
his
head
i
not
say
it
he
said
because
i
will
not
accuse
him
aloud
any
more
than
he
dares
to
tell
you
flatly
that
we
are
an
underground
organization
that
must
be
rooted
out
he
knows
about
our
highways
and
our
way
stations
and
our
cure
because
he
uses
the
same
cure
he
can
hide
behind
his
position
so
long
as
he
makes
no
direct
accusation
you
know
the
law
mr
cornell
yes
i
knew
the
law
so
long
as
the
accuser
came
into
court
with
a
completely
clean
mind
he
was
safe
but
scholar
phelps
could
hardly
make
the
accusation
nor
could
he
supply
the
tiniest
smidgin
of
direct
evidence
to
me
for
in
my
accusation
i
implicate
him
as
an
and
then
he
would
be
called
upon
to
supply
not
only
evidence
but
a
clear
clean
and
open
mind
in
shorter
words
the
old
stunt
of
pointing
loudly
to
someone
else
as
a
dodge
for
covering
up
your
own
crime
was
a
lost
art
in
this
world
of
telepathic
competence
the
law
of
course
insisted
that
no
man
could
be
convicted
for
what
he
was
thinking
but
only
upon
direct
evidence
of
action
but
a
witness
found
himself
in
deep
trouble
anyway
even
though
crooked
thinking
was
in
itself
no
crime
now
for
one
more
time
said
macklin
consider
a
medical
person
who
can
not
qualify
because
he
is
a
telepath
and
not
a
perceptive
his
very
soul
was
devoted
to
being
a
scholar
of
medicine
like
his
father
and
his
grandfather
but
his
telepath
ability
does
not
allow
him
to
be
the
full
scholar
a
doctor
he
can
be
but
he
can
never
achieve
the
final
training
again
the
ultimate
degree
such
a
man
overcompensates
and
becomes
the
frustrate
a
ripe
disciple
for
the
superman
theory
dr
thorndyke
i
blurted
his
face
was
as
blank
as
noncommittal
as
a
bronze
bust
i
could
neither
detect
affirmation
nor
negation
in
it
he
was
playing
it
flat
i
never
get
any
evidence
from
him
either
so
now
cornell
i
have
given
you
food
for
thought
i
made
no
direct
statements
nothing
that
you
could
point
to
i
defended
myself
as
any
man
will
do
but
only
by
protestations
of
innocence
therefore
i
suggest
that
you
take
your
artillery
and
vacate
the
premises
i
remembered
the
bonanza
that
was
hanging
in
my
hand
shamefacedly
i
slipped
it
back
in
my
hip
pocket
but
look
sir
please
leave
cornell
any
more
i
can
not
say
without
laying
us
wide
open
for
trouble
i
am
sorry
for
you
it
is
no
joy
being
a
pawn
but
i
hope
that
your
will
work
for
our
side
and
i
hope
that
you
will
come
through
it
safely
now
please
leave
us
quietly
i
shrugged
i
left
and
as
i
was
leaving
miss
macklin
touched
my
arm
and
said
in
a
soft
voice
i
hope
you
find
your
catherine
steve
and
i
hope
that
someday
you
be
able
to
join
her
i
nodded
dumbly
it
was
not
until
i
was
all
the
way
back
to
my
car
that
i
remembered
that
her
last
statement
was
something
similar
to
wishing
me
a
case
of
measles
so
that
i
be
afterward
immune
from
them
xi
as
the
miles
separated
me
from
the
macklins
my
mind
kept
whirling
around
in
a
tight
circle
i
had
a
lot
of
the
bits
but
none
of
them
seemed
to
lock
together
very
tight
and
unhappily
too
many
of
the
bits
that
fit
together
were
hunks
that
i
did
not
like
i
knew
the
futility
of
being
had
macklin
given
me
the
truth
or
was
i
being
sold
another
shoddy
bill
of
goods
or
had
he
spun
me
a
yarn
just
to
get
me
out
of
his
house
without
a
riot
of
course
there
had
been
a
riot
and
he
been
expecting
it
if
nothing
else
it
proved
that
i
was
a
valuable
bit
of
material
for
some
undisclosed
reason
i
had
to
grin
i
did
know
the
reason
but
whatever
reason
they
had
it
must
gripe
the
devil
out
of
them
to
be
unable
to
erase
me
then
the
grin
faded
no
one
had
told
me
about
catherine
they
neatly
avoided
the
subject
well
since
i
taken
off
on
this
still
hunt
to
find
catherine
i
continue
looking
even
though
every
corner
i
looked
into
turned
out
to
be
the
hiding
place
for
another
bunch
of
mad
spooks
my
mind
took
another
tack
admitting
that
neither
side
could
rub
me
out
without
losing
why
in
heck
did
they
just
collect
me
and
put
me
in
a
cage
dammit
if
i
had
an
organization
as
well
oiled
as
either
of
them
i
could
collect
the
president
right
out
of
the
new
white
house
and
put
him
in
a
cage
along
with
the
king
of
england
the
shah
of
persia
and
the
dali
lama
to
make
a
fourth
for
bridge
this
was
one
of
those
questions
that
can
not
be
answered
by
the
application
of
logic
reasoning
or
by
applying
either
experience
or
knowledge
i
did
not
know
nor
understand
and
the
only
way
i
would
ever
find
out
was
to
locate
someone
who
was
willing
to
tell
then
it
occurred
to
me
that
aside
from
my
one
experience
in
housebreaking
that
i
been
playing
according
to
the
rules
i
pretty
much
a
citizen
yet
it
did
seem
to
me
that
i
learned
more
during
those
times
when
the
rules
if
not
broken
at
least
were
bent
rather
sharply
so
i
decided
to
try
my
hand
at
busting
a
couple
of
rather
rules
there
was
a
way
to
track
down
catherine
so
i
gassed
up
the
buggy
turned
the
nose
east
and
took
off
like
a
man
with
a
purpose
in
mind
en
route
i
laid
out
my
course
along
that
course
there
turned
out
to
be
seven
way
stations
according
to
the
highway
signs
three
of
them
were
along
on
the
way
from
yellowstone
to
chicago
one
of
them
was
between
chicago
and
hammond
indiana
there
was
another
to
the
south
of
sandusky
ohio
one
was
somewhere
south
of
erie
and
the
last
was
in
the
vicinity
of
newark
there
were
a
lot
of
the
highways
themselves
leading
into
and
out
of
my
main
route
as
well
as
along
it
but
i
ignored
them
all
and
nobody
gave
me
a
rough
time
eventually
i
walked
into
my
apartment
it
was
musty
dusty
and
lonesome
some
of
catherine
things
were
still
on
the
table
where
dropped
them
they
looked
up
at
me
mutely
until
i
covered
them
with
the
walloping
pile
of
mail
that
had
arrived
in
my
long
absence
i
got
a
bottle
of
beer
and
began
to
go
through
the
mail
wastebasketing
the
advertisements
piling
the
magazines
neatly
and
filing
some
offers
of
jobs
which
reminded
me
that
i
was
still
an
engineer
and
that
my
funds
would
last
indefinitely
and
went
on
through
the
mail
until
i
came
to
a
letter
the
letter
cornell
glad
to
hear
from
you
we
moved
not
because
marian
caught
mekstrom
but
because
the
dead
area
shifted
and
left
us
sort
of
living
in
a
is
hale
and
hearty
here
and
we
all
wish
you
the
do
not
think
for
a
moment
that
you
owe
us
anything
rather
be
free
of
your
debt
we
regret
that
catherine
was
not
with
you
maybe
the
accident
might
not
have
happened
but
we
do
all
think
that
we
stand
as
an
association
with
a
very
unhappy
period
in
your
life
and
that
it
will
be
better
for
you
if
you
try
to
forget
that
we
exist
this
is
a
hard
thing
to
say
steve
but
really
all
we
can
do
for
you
is
to
remind
you
of
your
with
love
from
all
of
us
we
like
to
make
this
a
sincerely
sympathetic
and
final
philip
i
grunted
unhappily
it
was
a
letter
but
it
did
not
ring
true
somehow
i
sat
there
digging
it
for
hidden
meanings
but
none
came
i
did
care
in
fact
i
did
really
expect
any
more
than
this
if
they
not
written
me
at
all
i
still
have
done
what
i
did
i
sat
down
and
wrote
phillip
harrison
another
letter
philip
received
your
letter
today
as
i
returned
from
an
extended
trip
through
the
west
i
glad
to
hear
that
marian
is
not
suffering
from
mekstrom
disease
i
am
told
that
it
is
fatal
to
the
i
hope
to
see
you
steve
i
thought
do
it
then
to
help
me
and
my
esper
i
located
a
tiny
silk
handkerchief
of
catherine
one
she
left
after
one
of
her
visits
i
slipped
it
into
the
envelope
and
slapped
a
stamp
and
a
notation
on
the
envelope
that
this
letter
was
to
be
forwarded
to
phillip
harrison
i
dropped
it
in
the
box
about
eleven
that
night
but
i
did
bother
trying
to
follow
it
until
the
morning
ultimately
it
was
picked
up
and
taken
to
the
local
post
office
and
from
there
it
went
to
the
clearing
station
at
pennsylvania
station
at
where
i
hung
around
the
section
until
i
attracted
the
attention
of
a
policeman
looking
for
something
mr
cornell
not
particularly
i
told
the
telepath
cop
why
you
been
digging
every
mailbag
that
comes
out
of
there
am
i
i
asked
ingeniously
can
it
buster
or
we
let
you
dig
your
way
out
of
a
jail
you
ca
arrest
a
man
for
thinking
i
be
happy
to
make
it
loitering
he
said
sharply
i
a
train
ticket
use
it
then
sure
at
train
time
i
use
it
which
train
he
asked
me
sourly
you
missed
three
already
i
waiting
for
a
special
train
officer
then
please
go
and
wait
in
the
bar
mr
cornell
okay
i
sorry
i
caused
you
any
trouble
but
i
a
bit
of
a
personal
problem
it
is
illegal
anything
that
involves
taking
a
perceptive
dig
at
the
mail
is
illegal
said
the
policeman
personal
or
not
it
out
so
either
you
stop
digging
or
else
i
left
there
was
no
sense
in
arguing
with
the
cop
i
just
end
up
short
so
i
went
to
the
bar
and
i
found
out
why
he
recommended
it
it
was
in
a
area
hazy
enough
to
prevent
me
from
taking
a
squint
at
the
baggage
section
i
had
a
couple
of
fast
ones
but
i
could
stand
the
suspense
of
not
knowing
when
my
letter
might
take
off
without
me
since
i
also
pushed
my
i
gave
up
the
only
thing
i
could
hope
for
was
that
the
sealed
forwarding
address
had
been
made
out
at
that
little
town
near
the
harrisons
and
had
been
moved
so
i
went
and
took
a
train
that
carried
no
mail
it
made
my
life
hard
i
had
to
wander
around
that
tank
town
for
hours
keeping
a
on
the
post
office
for
either
the
income
or
the
outgo
of
my
precious
hunk
of
mail
i
caught
some
hard
eyes
from
the
local
yokels
but
eventually
i
discovered
that
my
luck
was
with
me
a
fast
train
whiffled
through
the
town
and
they
a
mailbag
off
the
car
at
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
per
i
found
out
that
the
next
stop
of
that
train
was
albany
i
have
been
out
of
luck
if
i
hoped
to
ride
with
the
bag
then
came
another
period
of
haunting
that
dinky
post
office
mentioned
before
that
it
was
in
a
dead
area
so
i
could
watch
the
insides
only
the
exits
until
at
long
last
i
perceived
my
favorite
bit
of
mail
emerging
in
another
bag
it
was
carted
to
the
railroad
station
and
hung
up
on
another
hook
i
bought
a
ticket
back
to
new
york
and
sat
on
a
bench
near
the
hook
probing
into
the
bag
as
hard
as
my
sense
of
perception
could
dig
i
cursed
the
whole
world
the
bag
was
merely
labelled
forwarding
mail
in
letters
that
could
be
seen
at
ninety
feet
my
own
letter
of
course
i
could
read
very
well
to
every
dotted
and
crossed
and
the
stitching
in
catherine
little
kerchief
but
i
could
not
make
out
the
address
printed
on
the
form
that
was
pasted
across
the
front
of
the
letter
itself
as
i
sat
there
trying
to
probe
that
sealed
address
a
fast
train
came
along
and
scooped
the
bag
off
the
hook
i
caught
the
next
train
i
swore
and
i
squirmed
and
i
groaned
because
that
train
stopped
at
every
wide
spot
in
the
road
paused
to
take
on
milk
swap
cars
and
generally
tried
to
see
how
long
it
could
take
to
make
a
run
of
some
forty
miles
this
was
fate
naturally
any
train
that
stopped
at
my
rattle
burg
would
also
stop
at
every
other
point
along
the
road
where
some
pioneer
had
stopped
to
toss
a
beer
bottle
off
of
his
covered
wagon
at
long
last
i
returned
to
pennsylvania
station
just
in
time
to
perceive
my
letter
being
loaded
on
a
conveyor
for
laguardia
then
the
same
damned
policeman
collared
me
this
is
it
he
said
now
see
here
officer
i
will
you
come
quietly
cornell
or
shall
i
put
the
big
arm
on
you
for
what
you
been
violating
the
section
of
the
federal
communications
act
and
i
know
it
now
look
officer
i
said
this
was
not
illegal
i
not
an
idiot
cornell
i
noted
uncomfortably
that
he
had
dropped
the
formal
address
you
have
been
trailing
a
specific
piece
of
mail
with
the
express
purpose
of
finding
out
where
it
is
going
since
its
destination
is
a
sealed
forwarding
address
your
attempt
to
determine
this
destination
is
a
violation
of
the
act
he
eyed
me
coldly
as
if
to
dare
me
to
deny
it
now
he
finished
shall
i
read
you
chapter
and
verse
he
had
me
cold
the
act
was
an
old
ruling
that
any
transmission
must
not
be
used
for
the
benefit
of
any
handler
when
rhine
came
along
act
was
extended
to
everything
look
officer
it
my
girl
hoping
that
would
make
a
difference
i
know
that
he
told
me
flatly
which
is
why
i
not
running
you
in
i
just
telling
you
to
lay
off
your
girl
went
away
and
left
you
a
sealed
forwarding
address
maybe
she
does
want
to
see
you
again
she
sick
i
said
maybe
her
family
thinks
you
made
her
sick
now
stop
it
and
go
away
and
if
i
ever
find
you
trying
to
dig
the
mail
again
you
dig
iron
bars
now
scat
he
urged
me
towards
the
outside
of
the
station
like
a
hazing
his
flock
i
took
a
cab
to
laguardia
even
though
it
was
not
as
fast
as
the
subway
i
was
glad
to
be
out
of
his
presence
i
connected
with
my
letter
again
at
laguardia
it
was
being
loaded
aboard
a
headed
for
chicago
denver
los
angeles
hawaii
and
manila
i
did
know
how
far
it
was
going
so
i
bought
a
ticket
for
the
route
with
my
travel
card
and
i
got
aboard
just
ahead
of
the
closing
door
my
bit
of
mail
was
in
the
compartment
below
me
and
in
the
hour
travel
time
to
chicago
i
found
out
that
chicago
was
the
destination
for
the
mailbag
although
the
superscript
on
the
letter
was
still
hazy
i
followed
the
bag
off
the
plane
at
chicago
and
stopped
long
enough
to
cancel
the
rest
of
my
ticket
there
was
no
use
wasting
the
money
for
the
unused
fare
from
chicago
to
manila
i
rode
into
the
city
in
a
combination
less
than
six
feet
from
my
little
during
the
ride
i
managed
to
dig
the
superscript
it
forwarded
the
letter
to
ladysmith
wisconsin
and
from
there
to
a
rural
route
that
i
could
understand
although
i
got
the
number
then
i
went
back
to
midway
airport
and
found
to
my
disgust
that
the
chicago
airport
did
not
have
a
bar
i
dug
into
this
oddity
for
a
moment
until
i
found
out
that
the
chicago
airport
was
built
on
public
school
property
and
that
according
to
law
they
could
sell
anything
harder
than
soda
pop
within
three
hundred
feet
of
public
school
property
no
matter
who
rented
it
so
i
dawdled
in
the
bar
across
cicero
avenue
until
plane
time
and
took
an
old
convair
to
eau
claire
on
a
ride
that
stopped
at
every
wide
spot
on
the
course
from
eau
claire
the
mail
bag
took
off
in
the
antediluvian
convair
but
i
took
off
by
train
because
the
bag
was
scheduled
to
be
dropped
by
guided
glider
into
ladysmith
at
ladysmith
i
rented
a
car
checked
the
rural
routes
and
took
off
about
the
same
time
as
my
significant
hunk
of
mail
nine
miles
from
ladysmith
is
a
flagstop
called
bruce
and
not
far
from
bruce
there
is
a
body
of
water
slightly
larger
than
a
duck
pond
called
caley
lake
a
backroad
decorated
with
ornamental
metal
signs
led
me
from
bruce
wisconsin
to
caley
lake
where
the
road
signs
showed
a
missing
spoke
i
turned
in
feeling
like
ferdinand
magellan
must
have
felt
when
he
finally
made
his
passage
through
the
strait
to
discover
the
open
sea
that
lay
beyond
the
new
world
i
had
done
a
fine
job
of
tailing
and
i
wanted
someone
to
pin
a
leather
medal
on
me
the
side
road
wound
in
and
out
for
a
few
hundred
yards
and
then
i
saw
phillip
harrison
he
was
poking
a
long
tool
into
the
guts
of
an
automatic
pump
built
to
lift
water
from
a
deep
well
into
a
water
tower
about
forty
feet
tall
he
did
not
notice
my
arrival
until
i
stopped
my
rented
car
beside
him
and
said
being
a
mechanical
engineer
and
an
esper
phil
i
can
tell
you
that
you
have
a
a
worn
gasket
seal
he
said
it
does
take
an
esper
engineer
to
figure
it
out
how
the
heck
did
you
find
us
out
in
your
mailbox
there
is
a
letter
i
told
him
i
came
with
it
he
eyed
me
humorously
how
much
postage
did
you
cost
or
did
you
come
second
class
mail
i
was
not
sure
that
i
cared
for
the
inference
but
phillip
was
kidding
me
by
the
on
his
face
i
asked
phil
please
tell
me
what
is
going
on
his
faded
he
shook
his
head
unhappily
as
he
said
why
you
leave
alone
my
feelings
welled
up
and
i
blew
my
scalp
let
well
enough
alone
i
roared
i
pushed
from
pillar
to
post
by
everybody
you
steal
my
girl
i
in
hokus
with
the
cops
and
then
you
tell
me
that
i
to
stay
up
the
proverbial
estuary
lacking
the
customary
means
of
locomotion
he
finished
with
a
smile
i
could
see
the
humor
in
it
yeah
i
drawled
humorlessly
you
realize
that
you
probably
as
big
a
liability
with
us
as
you
were
trying
to
find
us
i
grunted
i
could
always
blow
my
brains
out
that
no
solution
and
you
know
it
then
give
me
an
alternative
phillip
shrugged
now
that
you
here
you
here
it
obvious
that
you
know
too
much
steve
you
should
have
left
well
enough
alone
i
did
know
well
enough
besides
i
could
have
been
pushed
better
if
someone
had
slipped
me
i
stopped
stunned
at
the
idea
and
then
i
went
on
in
a
falter
a
suggestion
steve
you
better
come
in
and
meet
marian
maybe
that
what
happened
marian
i
said
hollowly
she
a
telepath
master
of
psi
no
less
my
mind
went
red
as
i
remembered
how
i
catalogued
her
physical
charms
on
our
first
meeting
in
an
effort
to
find
out
whether
she
were
esper
or
telepath
marian
had
fine
control
her
mind
must
have
positively
seethed
at
my
invasion
of
her
privacy
i
did
not
want
to
meet
marian
face
to
face
right
now
but
there
was
a
thing
i
could
do
about
it
phillip
left
his
pump
and
waved
for
me
to
follow
he
took
off
in
his
jeep
and
i
trailed
him
to
the
farmhouse
we
went
through
a
dim
area
that
was
almost
the
ideal
shape
for
a
home
the
ring
was
not
complete
but
the
open
part
faced
the
fields
behind
the
house
so
that
good
privacy
was
ensured
for
all
practical
purposes
on
the
steps
of
the
verandah
stood
marian
sight
of
her
was
enough
to
make
me
forget
my
of
a
few
moments
ago
she
stood
tall
and
lissome
the
picture
of
slender
robust
health
come
in
steve
she
said
holding
out
her
hand
i
took
it
her
grip
was
firm
and
hard
but
it
was
gentle
i
knew
that
she
could
have
pulped
my
hand
if
she
squeezed
hard
i
very
happy
to
see
that
rumor
is
wrong
and
that
not
suffering
from
mekstrom
disease
i
told
her
so
now
you
know
steve
too
bad
why
because
it
adds
a
load
to
all
of
us
even
you
she
looked
at
me
thoughtfully
for
a
moment
then
said
well
come
on
in
and
relax
steve
we
talk
it
out
we
all
went
inside
on
a
divan
in
the
living
room
covered
by
a
light
blanket
resting
in
a
very
light
snooze
was
a
woman
her
face
was
turned
away
from
me
but
the
hair
and
the
line
of
the
figure
and
the
catherine
she
turned
and
sat
up
at
once
alive
and
shocked
awake
she
rubbed
the
sleep
from
her
eyes
with
swift
knuckles
and
then
looked
over
her
hands
at
me
steve
she
cried
and
all
the
world
and
the
soul
of
her
was
in
the
throb
of
her
voice
xii
catherine
took
one
unsteady
step
towards
me
and
then
came
forward
with
a
rush
she
hurled
herself
into
my
arms
pressed
herself
against
me
held
me
tight
it
was
like
being
attacked
by
a
bulldozer
phillip
stayed
my
back
against
her
headlong
rush
or
i
would
have
been
thrown
back
out
through
the
door
across
the
verandah
and
into
the
middle
of
the
yard
the
strength
of
her
crushed
my
chest
and
wrenched
my
spine
her
lips
crushed
mine
i
began
to
black
out
from
the
physical
hunger
of
a
woman
who
did
not
know
the
extent
of
her
body
all
that
catherine
remembered
was
that
once
she
held
me
to
the
end
of
her
strength
and
yearned
for
more
to
hold
me
that
way
now
meant
death
her
body
was
the
same
slenderness
but
the
warm
softness
was
gone
it
was
a
waist
of
flexible
steel
i
was
being
held
by
a
statue
of
bronze
animated
by
some
monster
this
was
no
woman
phillip
and
marian
pried
her
away
from
me
before
she
broke
my
back
phillip
led
her
away
whispering
softly
in
her
ear
marian
carried
me
to
the
divan
and
let
me
down
on
my
face
gently
her
hands
were
gentle
as
she
pressed
the
air
back
into
my
lungs
and
soothed
away
the
awful
wrench
in
my
spine
gradually
i
came
alive
again
but
there
was
pain
left
that
made
me
gasp
at
every
breath
then
the
physical
hurt
went
away
leaving
only
the
mental
pain
the
horror
of
knowing
that
the
girl
that
i
loved
could
never
hold
me
in
her
arms
i
shuddered
all
that
i
wanted
out
of
this
life
was
marriage
with
catherine
and
now
that
i
had
found
her
again
i
had
to
face
the
fact
that
the
first
embrace
would
kill
me
i
cursed
my
fate
just
as
any
invalid
has
cursed
the
malady
that
makes
him
a
responsibility
and
a
burden
to
his
partner
instead
of
a
joy
and
helpmeet
like
the
helpless
i
did
want
it
i
had
asked
for
it
nor
had
i
earned
it
yet
all
i
could
do
was
to
rail
against
the
unfairness
of
the
unwarranted
punishment
without
knowing
that
i
was
asking
i
cried
out
but
why
in
a
plaintive
voice
in
a
gentle
tone
marian
replied
steve
you
can
not
blame
yourself
catherine
was
lost
to
you
before
you
met
her
at
her
apartment
that
evening
what
she
thought
to
be
a
callous
on
her
small
toe
was
really
the
initial
infection
of
mekstrom
disease
we
all
to
mekstrom
disease
steve
so
when
you
cracked
up
and
dad
and
phil
went
on
the
dead
run
to
help
they
caught
a
perception
of
it
naturally
we
had
to
help
her
i
must
have
looked
bitter
look
steve
said
phillip
slowly
you
would
have
wanted
us
not
to
help
after
all
would
you
want
catherine
to
stay
with
you
so
that
you
could
watch
her
die
at
the
rate
of
a
of
an
inch
each
hour
hell
i
snarled
someone
might
have
let
me
know
phillip
shook
his
head
we
could
steve
you
got
to
understand
our
viewpoint
to
heck
with
your
viewpoint
i
roared
angrily
has
anybody
ever
stopped
to
consider
mine
i
did
not
give
a
hoot
that
they
could
wind
me
around
a
doorknob
and
tuck
my
feet
in
the
keyhole
sure
i
was
grateful
for
their
aid
to
catherine
but
why
did
someone
stop
to
think
of
the
poor
benighted
case
who
was
in
the
accident
ward
the
bird
that
had
been
traipsing
all
over
hell
footstool
trying
to
get
a
line
on
his
lost
sweetheart
i
been
through
the
grinder
questioned
by
the
suspected
by
the
police
and
i
been
the
guy
who
been
asked
by
a
grieving
elderly
couple
but
ca
you
remember
son
them
and
their
stinking
point
of
view
easy
steve
warned
phillip
harrison
easy
nothing
what
possible
justification
have
you
for
putting
me
through
my
jumps
look
steve
we
in
a
precarious
position
we
fighting
a
battle
against
an
unscrupulous
enemy
an
undercover
battle
steve
if
we
could
get
something
on
phelps
we
expose
him
and
his
medical
center
like
that
conversely
if
we
slip
a
millimeter
phelps
will
clip
us
so
hard
that
the
sky
will
ring
he
damn
him
has
the
government
on
his
side
we
ca
afford
to
look
suspicious
could
you
have
taken
me
in
too
he
shook
his
head
sadly
no
he
said
there
was
a
bad
accident
you
know
the
authorities
have
every
right
to
insist
that
each
and
every
automobile
on
the
highway
be
occupied
by
a
minimum
of
one
driver
they
also
believe
that
for
every
accident
there
must
be
a
victim
even
though
the
damage
is
no
more
than
a
bad
case
of
fright
i
could
hardly
argue
with
that
changing
the
subject
i
asked
but
what
about
the
others
who
just
drop
out
of
sight
we
see
to
it
that
plausible
letters
of
explanation
are
written
so
who
wrote
me
i
demanded
hotly
he
looked
at
me
pointedly
if
we
known
about
catherine
before
have
disappeared
leaving
you
a
trite
letter
but
no
one
could
think
of
a
letter
to
explain
her
disappearance
from
an
accident
steve
oh
fine
well
you
still
prefer
to
find
her
alive
would
you
could
someone
tell
me
and
have
you
radiating
the
fact
like
a
broadcasting
station
why
could
i
have
joined
her
you
he
shook
his
head
in
the
same
way
that
a
man
shakes
it
when
he
is
trying
to
explain
two
plus
two
are
four
and
not
maybe
five
or
three
and
a
half
steve
he
said
you
have
got
mekstroms
disease
how
do
i
get
it
i
demanded
hotly
nobody
knows
he
said
unhappily
if
we
did
we
be
providing
the
rest
of
the
human
race
with
indestructible
bodies
as
fast
as
we
could
spread
it
and
take
care
of
them
but
could
i
have
been
told
i
pleaded
i
must
have
sounded
like
a
hurt
kitten
marian
put
her
hand
on
my
arm
steve
she
said
you
have
been
smoothed
over
maybe
brought
in
to
work
for
us
in
some
dead
area
but
then
you
turned
up
acting
dangerously
for
all
of
us
who
me
by
the
time
you
came
out
for
your
visit
you
were
dangerous
to
us
what
do
you
mean
let
me
find
out
relax
will
you
steve
i
like
to
read
you
deep
catherine
you
come
in
with
me
what
are
we
looking
for
traces
of
suggestion
it
be
hard
to
find
because
there
will
be
only
traces
of
a
plan
all
put
in
so
that
it
looks
like
natural
logical
reasoning
catherine
looked
doubtful
when
would
they
have
the
chance
she
asked
thorndyke
in
the
hospital
catherine
nodded
and
i
relaxed
at
the
beginning
i
was
very
reluctant
i
did
mind
catherine
digging
into
the
dark
and
dusty
corners
of
my
mind
but
marian
harrison
bothered
me
think
of
the
accident
steve
she
said
then
i
managed
to
lull
my
reluctant
mind
by
remembering
that
she
was
trying
to
help
me
i
relaxed
mentally
and
physically
and
regressed
back
to
the
day
of
the
accident
i
found
it
hard
even
then
to
go
through
the
and
sweet
seriousness
that
went
on
between
catherine
and
me
knowing
that
marian
harrison
was
a
sort
of
mental
spectator
but
i
fought
down
my
reticence
and
went
on
with
it
i
practically
the
accident
it
was
easier
now
that
i
found
catherine
again
it
was
like
a
cleansing
bath
i
began
to
enjoy
it
so
i
went
on
with
my
life
and
adventures
right
up
to
the
present
having
come
to
the
end
i
stopped
marian
looked
at
catherine
did
you
get
it
silence
more
silence
then
it
seems
dim
almost
incredulous
that
it
could
be
with
a
into
thought
again
phillip
snorted
make
with
the
you
two
the
rest
of
us
are
telepaths
you
know
sorry
said
marian
it
sort
of
complicated
and
hard
to
figure
you
know
what
seems
to
be
the
case
is
sort
of
like
this
she
went
on
in
an
uncertain
tone
we
ca
find
any
direct
evidence
of
anything
like
hypnotic
suggestion
the
urge
to
follow
what
you
call
the
highways
in
hiding
is
rather
high
for
a
mere
bump
of
curiosity
but
nothing
definite
i
think
you
were
probably
urged
very
gently
catherine
objects
saying
that
it
would
take
a
brilliant
to
do
a
job
delicate
enough
to
produce
the
urge
without
showing
the
traces
of
the
operation
someone
of
scholar
grade
in
both
psychology
and
telepathy
said
catherine
i
thought
it
over
for
a
moment
it
seems
to
me
that
whoever
did
it
if
it
was
done
was
well
aware
that
a
good
part
of
this
urge
would
be
generated
by
catherine
total
and
unexplicable
disappearance
have
saved
yourselves
a
lot
of
trouble
and
saved
me
a
lot
of
heartache
if
you
let
me
know
something
god
have
you
any
feelings
catherine
looked
at
me
from
hurt
eyes
steve
she
said
quietly
a
billion
girls
have
sworn
that
they
rather
die
than
live
without
their
one
and
only
i
swore
it
too
but
when
your
life
end
is
shown
to
you
on
a
microscope
slide
love
becomes
less
important
what
should
i
do
just
die
painfully
that
was
handing
it
to
me
on
a
platter
it
hurt
but
i
am
not
chuckleheaded
enough
to
insist
that
she
come
with
me
to
die
instead
of
leaving
me
and
living
what
really
hurt
was
not
knowing
steve
said
marian
you
know
that
we
could
have
told
you
the
truth
yeah
i
agreed
disconsolately
let
suppose
that
catherine
wrote
you
a
letter
telling
you
that
she
was
alive
and
safe
but
that
she
reconsidered
the
marriage
you
were
to
forget
her
and
all
that
what
happens
next
unhappily
i
told
him
i
not
have
believed
it
phillip
nodded
next
would
have
been
a
team
maybe
a
perceptive
with
a
temporal
sense
who
could
retrace
that
letter
back
to
the
point
of
origin
teamed
up
with
a
telepath
strong
enough
to
drill
a
hole
through
the
dead
area
that
surrounds
new
washington
why
even
before
rhine
institute
it
was
sheer
folly
for
a
runaway
to
write
a
letter
what
would
it
be
now
i
nodded
what
he
said
was
true
but
it
did
not
ease
the
hurt
then
on
the
other
hand
he
went
on
in
a
more
cheerful
vein
take
another
look
at
us
and
you
steve
tell
me
fellow
where
are
you
now
i
looked
up
at
him
phillip
was
smiling
in
a
sort
of
manner
i
looked
at
marian
she
was
catherine
looked
satisfied
i
got
it
yeah
i
here
you
here
without
having
any
letters
without
leaving
any
broad
trail
of
suspicion
upon
yourself
you
not
disappeared
steve
you
been
up
and
down
the
country
all
on
your
own
decision
where
you
go
and
what
you
do
is
your
own
business
and
nobody
is
going
to
set
up
a
hue
and
cry
after
you
sure
it
took
a
lot
longer
this
way
but
it
was
a
lot
safer
he
grinned
wide
then
as
he
went
on
and
if
you
like
to
take
some
comfort
out
of
it
just
remember
that
you
shown
yourself
to
be
quite
capable
filled
with
dogged
determination
and
ultimately
successful
he
was
right
in
fact
if
i
tried
the
stunt
long
earlier
i
have
been
here
a
lot
sooner
all
right
i
said
so
what
do
we
do
now
we
go
on
and
on
and
on
steve
until
we
successful
successful
he
nodded
soberly
until
we
can
make
every
man
woman
and
child
on
the
face
of
this
earth
as
much
physical
superman
as
we
are
our
job
is
not
finished
i
nodded
i
learned
a
few
of
the
answers
at
the
macklin
place
then
this
does
not
come
as
a
complete
shock
no
not
a
complete
shock
but
there
are
a
lot
of
loose
ends
still
so
the
basic
theme
i
buy
scholar
phelps
and
his
medical
center
are
busy
using
their
public
position
to
create
the
nucleus
of
a
totalitarian
state
or
a
physical
hierarchy
you
and
the
highways
in
hiding
are
busy
tearing
phelps
down
because
you
do
want
to
see
any
more
rule
by
the
divine
right
of
kings
dictators
or
family
lines
go
on
steve
well
why
in
the
devil
do
you
announce
yourselves
no
good
old
man
look
you
yourself
want
to
be
a
mekstrom
even
with
your
grasp
of
the
situation
you
resent
the
fact
that
you
can
not
you
right
phillip
nodded
slowly
let
hypothesize
for
a
moment
taking
a
subject
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
mekstrom
disease
let
take
one
of
the
old
standby
plots
some
cataclysm
is
threatening
the
solar
system
the
future
of
the
earth
is
threatened
and
we
have
only
one
spacecraft
capable
of
carrying
a
hundred
people
to
safety
somewhere
else
how
would
you
select
them
i
shrugged
since
we
hypothecating
i
suppose
that
i
select
the
more
healthy
the
more
intelligent
the
more
virile
the
more
i
struggled
for
another
category
and
then
let
it
stand
right
there
because
i
could
think
of
another
at
that
instant
phillip
agreed
health
and
intelligence
and
all
the
rest
being
pretty
much
a
matter
of
birth
and
upbringing
how
can
you
explain
to
wilbur
zilch
that
oscar
hossenpfeiffer
has
shown
himself
smarter
and
healthier
and
therefore
better
stock
for
survival
maybe
you
can
but
the
is
that
wilbur
zilch
slaughters
oscar
hossenpfeiffer
this
either
provides
an
opening
for
zilch
or
if
he
is
caught
at
it
it
provides
zilch
with
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
he
stopped
the
other
guy
from
getting
what
he
could
not
come
by
honestly
so
what
has
this
to
do
with
mekstrom
disease
and
supermen
the
day
that
we
and
i
mean
either
of
us
announces
that
we
can
mekstrom
disease
and
make
physical
supermen
of
the
former
victims
there
will
be
a
large
scream
from
everybody
to
give
them
the
same
treatment
no
we
tell
them
we
ca
cure
anybody
who
has
caught
it
then
some
pedagogue
will
stand
up
and
declare
that
we
are
suppressing
information
this
will
be
believed
by
enough
people
to
do
us
more
harm
than
good
darn
it
we
not
absolutely
indestructible
steve
we
can
be
killed
we
could
be
wiped
out
by
a
mob
of
angry
citizens
who
saw
in
us
a
threat
to
their
security
neither
we
of
the
highways
nor
phelps
of
the
medical
center
have
enough
manpower
to
be
safe
so
that
i
accept
the
next
awkward
question
comes
up
what
are
we
going
to
do
with
me
you
agreed
that
we
can
not
move
until
we
know
how
to
inoculate
healthy
flesh
we
need
normal
humans
to
be
our
guinea
pigs
will
you
help
bring
to
the
earth
people
the
blessing
that
is
now
denied
them
if
you
are
successful
steve
said
marian
you
go
down
in
history
along
with
otto
mekstrom
you
could
be
the
turning
point
of
the
human
race
you
know
and
if
i
fail
phillip
harrison
face
took
on
a
hard
and
determined
look
steve
there
can
be
no
failure
we
shall
go
on
and
on
until
we
have
success
that
was
a
fine
prospect
old
cornell
celebrating
his
seventieth
birthday
as
the
medical
experimentation
went
on
and
on
catherine
was
leaning
forward
her
eyes
bright
steve
she
cried
you
just
to
just
call
me
the
unwilling
hero
i
said
in
a
drab
voice
and
put
it
down
that
the
condemned
specimen
drank
a
hearty
dinner
i
trust
that
there
is
a
drink
in
the
house
there
was
enough
whiskey
in
the
place
to
provide
the
new
specimen
with
a
anesthesia
the
evening
was
spent
in
forced
badinage
shallow
laughter
and
a
pointed
avoidance
of
the
main
subject
the
whiskey
was
good
i
took
it
undiluted
and
succeeded
in
getting
boiled
to
the
eyebrows
before
they
carted
me
off
to
bed
i
did
not
sleep
well
despite
my
anesthesia
there
was
too
much
on
my
mind
and
very
little
of
it
was
the
fault
of
the
harrisons
one
of
the
things
that
i
had
to
face
was
the
cold
fact
that
part
of
lack
of
communication
with
me
was
caused
by
logic
and
good
sense
both
history
and
fiction
are
filled
with
cases
where
love
was
set
aside
because
consummation
was
impossible
for
any
number
of
good
reasons
so
i
slept
fitfully
and
my
dreams
were
as
unhappy
as
the
thoughts
i
had
during
my
waking
moments
somehow
i
realized
that
i
have
been
far
better
off
if
i
been
able
to
forget
catherine
after
the
accident
if
i
been
able
to
resist
the
urge
to
follow
the
highways
in
hiding
if
i
never
known
that
those
ornamental
road
signs
were
something
more
than
the
desire
of
some
road
commissioner
to
beautify
the
countryside
but
no
i
had
to
go
and
poke
my
big
bump
of
curiosity
into
the
problem
so
here
i
was
resentful
as
all
hell
because
i
was
denied
the
pleasure
of
living
in
the
strong
body
of
a
mekstrom
it
was
not
fair
although
life
itself
is
seldom
fair
it
seemed
to
me
that
life
was
less
fair
to
me
than
to
others
and
then
to
compound
my
feelings
of
persecution
i
woke
up
once
about
three
in
the
morning
with
a
strong
urge
to
take
a
perceptive
dig
down
below
i
should
have
resisted
it
but
of
course
no
one
has
ever
been
able
to
resist
the
urge
of
his
sense
of
perception
down
in
the
living
room
catherine
was
crying
on
phillip
shoulder
he
held
her
gently
with
one
arm
around
her
slender
waist
and
he
was
stroking
her
hair
softly
with
his
other
hand
i
could
begin
to
dig
what
was
being
said
but
the
tableau
was
unmistakable
she
leaned
back
and
looked
at
him
as
he
said
something
her
head
moved
in
a
motion
as
she
took
a
deep
breath
for
another
bawl
she
buried
her
face
in
his
neck
and
sobbed
phillip
held
her
close
for
a
moment
and
then
loosed
one
hand
to
find
a
handkerchief
for
her
he
wiped
her
eyes
gently
and
talked
to
her
until
she
shook
her
head
in
a
visible
effort
to
shake
away
both
the
tears
and
the
unhappy
thoughts
eventually
he
lit
two
cigarettes
and
handed
one
to
her
side
by
side
they
walked
to
the
divan
and
sat
down
close
together
catherine
leaned
against
him
gently
and
he
put
his
arm
over
her
shoulders
and
hugged
her
to
him
she
relaxed
looking
unhappy
but
obviously
taking
comfort
in
the
strength
and
physical
presence
of
him
it
was
a
hell
of
a
thing
to
dig
in
my
mental
condition
i
drifted
off
to
a
sleep
filled
with
unhappy
dreams
while
they
were
still
downstairs
frankly
i
forced
myself
into
fitful
sleep
because
i
did
not
want
to
stay
awake
to
follow
them
as
bad
as
the
nightmare
quality
of
my
dreams
were
they
were
better
for
me
than
the
probable
reality
oh
i
been
infernally
brilliant
when
i
uncovered
the
first
secret
of
the
highways
in
hiding
i
found
out
that
i
did
not
know
of
the
truth
they
had
a
network
of
highways
that
would
make
the
department
of
roads
and
highways
look
like
a
backwood
political
organization
i
believed
for
instance
that
the
highways
were
spotted
only
along
main
arteries
to
and
from
their
way
stations
the
truth
was
that
they
had
a
complete
system
from
one
end
of
the
country
to
the
other
lanes
led
from
maine
and
from
florida
into
a
central
main
highway
that
laid
across
the
breadth
of
the
united
states
then
from
washington
and
from
southern
california
another
branching
network
met
this
main
highway
lesser
lines
served
canada
and
mexico
the
big
main
trunk
ran
from
new
york
to
san
francisco
with
only
one
large
major
division
a
heavy
line
that
led
down
to
a
place
in
texas
called
homestead
texas
was
a
big
center
that
made
scholar
phelps
medical
center
look
like
a
teeny
weeny
village
by
comparison
we
drove
in
marian
car
my
rented
car
of
course
was
returned
to
the
agency
and
my
own
bus
would
be
ferried
out
as
soon
as
it
could
be
arranged
so
that
i
not
be
without
personal
transportation
in
texas
catherine
remained
in
wisconsin
because
she
was
too
new
at
being
a
mekstrom
to
know
how
to
conduct
herself
so
that
the
fact
of
her
body
did
not
cause
a
lot
of
slack
jaws
and
high
suspicion
we
drove
along
the
highways
to
homestead
carrying
a
bag
of
the
mekstrom
mail
the
trip
was
uneventful
xiii
since
this
account
of
my
life
and
adventures
is
not
being
written
without
some
plan
it
is
no
mere
coincidence
that
this
particular
section
comes
under
chapter
thirteen
old
unlucky
thirteen
covers
ninety
days
which
i
consider
the
most
dismal
ninety
days
of
my
life
things
which
had
been
going
along
smoothly
had
suddenly
got
worse
we
started
with
enthusiasm
they
cut
and
they
dug
and
they
poked
needles
into
me
and
trimmed
out
bits
of
my
hide
for
slides
i
helped
them
by
digging
my
own
flesh
and
letting
their
better
telepaths
read
my
results
for
their
records
they
were
nice
to
me
i
got
the
best
of
everything
but
being
nice
to
me
was
not
enough
it
sort
of
made
me
feel
like
gulliver
in
brobdingnag
they
were
so
that
they
did
not
know
their
own
strength
this
was
especially
true
of
the
youngsters
of
mekstrom
parents
i
tried
to
a
baby
one
night
and
got
my
ring
finger
gummed
for
my
efforts
it
was
like
wrestling
bad
cyril
in
a
match
winner
take
all
as
the
days
added
up
into
weeks
their
hope
and
enthusiasm
began
to
fade
the
long
list
of
proposed
experiments
dwindled
and
it
became
obvious
that
they
were
starting
to
work
on
brand
new
ideas
but
brand
new
ideas
are
neither
fast
in
arriving
nor
high
in
quantity
and
time
began
to
hang
dismally
heavy
they
began
to
avoid
my
eyes
they
stopped
discussing
their
attempts
on
me
i
no
longer
found
out
what
they
were
doing
and
how
they
hoped
to
accomplish
the
act
they
showed
the
helplessness
that
comes
of
failure
and
this
feeling
of
utter
futility
was
transmitted
to
me
at
first
i
was
mentally
frantic
at
the
idea
of
failure
but
as
the
futile
days
wore
on
and
the
fact
was
practically
shoved
down
my
throat
i
was
forced
to
admit
that
there
was
no
future
for
steve
cornell
i
began
at
that
time
to
look
forward
to
my
visit
to
reorientation
reorientation
is
a
form
of
mental
suicide
once
reoriented
the
problems
that
make
life
intolerable
are
forgotten
your
personality
is
changed
your
grasp
of
everything
is
revised
your
appreciation
of
all
things
comes
from
an
entirely
new
angle
you
are
a
new
person
then
one
morning
i
faced
my
image
in
the
mirror
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
if
i
could
be
me
i
did
want
to
be
somebody
else
it
is
no
good
to
be
alive
if
i
am
not
me
i
told
my
image
who
obediently
agreed
with
me
i
did
even
wait
to
argue
with
me
i
just
went
out
and
got
into
my
car
and
sloped
it
was
not
hard
everybody
in
homestead
trusted
me
xiv
i
left
homestead
with
a
idea
that
i
was
going
to
visit
bruce
wisconsin
long
enough
to
say
goodbye
to
catherine
and
to
release
her
from
any
matrimonial
involvement
she
may
have
felt
binding
i
did
not
relish
this
idea
but
i
felt
that
getting
it
out
done
and
agreed
was
only
a
duty
but
as
i
hit
the
road
and
had
time
to
think
i
knew
that
my
intention
was
a
sort
of
martyrdom
i
was
going
to
renounce
myself
in
a
fine
welter
of
tears
and
then
go
staggering
off
into
the
setting
sun
to
die
of
my
mental
wounds
i
took
careful
stock
of
myself
and
faced
the
fact
that
my
idea
was
a
sort
of
walking
into
any
mekstrom
way
station
now
was
just
asking
for
capture
and
a
fast
trip
to
their
reorientation
rooms
the
facts
of
my
failure
and
my
would
be
indication
enough
for
catherine
that
i
was
bowing
out
it
would
be
better
for
catherine
too
to
avoid
a
fine
emotional
scene
i
remembered
the
little
bawling
session
in
the
harrison
living
room
that
night
catherine
would
not
die
for
want
of
a
sympathetic
hand
on
her
shoulder
in
fact
as
she
said
pragmatically
well
balanced
people
never
die
of
broken
hearts
having
finally
convinced
myself
of
the
validity
of
this
piece
of
obvious
logic
i
suddenly
felt
a
lot
better
my
morose
feeling
faded
away
my
conviction
of
utter
uselessness
died
and
my
desire
to
investigate
a
highly
hypothetical
hereafter
took
an
abrupt
and
in
place
of
this
collection
of
undesirable
came
a
much
nicer
emotion
it
was
a
fine
feeling
that
royal
anger
that
boiled
up
inside
of
me
i
could
lick
and
i
could
join
so
i
was
going
out
to
pull
something
down
even
if
it
all
came
down
around
my
own
ears
i
stopped
long
enough
to
check
the
bonanza
both
visually
and
perceptively
and
then
loaded
it
full
i
consulted
a
road
map
to
chart
a
course
then
i
took
off
with
the
coal
wide
open
and
the
damper
rods
all
the
way
out
and
made
the
wheels
roll
towards
the
east
i
especially
gave
all
the
highways
a
very
wide
berth
i
went
down
several
but
always
in
the
wrong
direction
and
in
the
meantime
i
kept
my
sense
of
perception
on
the
alert
for
any
pursuit
i
drove
with
my
eyes
alone
i
could
have
made
it
across
the
mississippi
by
nightfall
if
i
not
taken
the
time
to
duck
highway
signs
but
when
i
got
good
and
sick
and
tired
of
driving
i
was
not
very
far
from
the
river
i
found
a
motel
in
a
rather
untravelled
spot
and
sacked
in
for
the
night
i
awoke
at
the
crack
of
dawn
with
a
feeling
of
impending
it
was
not
doom
because
any
would
have
nudged
me
on
the
bump
of
perception
nor
was
it
good
because
i
have
awakened
looking
forward
to
it
something
odd
was
up
and
doing
i
dressed
hastily
and
as
i
pulled
my
clothing
on
i
took
a
slow
dig
at
the
other
cabins
in
the
motel
number
one
contained
a
salesman
type
i
decided
after
digging
through
his
baggage
number
two
was
occupied
by
an
elderly
couple
who
were
loaded
with
junk
and
four
or
five
cameras
number
three
harbored
a
stopover
truck
driver
and
number
four
was
almost
overflowing
with
a
gang
of
schoolgirls
packed
in
the
single
bed
number
five
was
mine
number
six
was
vacant
number
seven
was
also
vacant
but
the
bed
was
tumbled
and
the
water
in
the
washbowl
was
still
running
out
and
the
door
was
still
slamming
and
the
little
front
steps
were
still
clicking
to
the
fast
clip
of
high
heels
and
i
hauled
myself
out
of
my
cabin
on
a
dead
gallop
and
made
a
fast
line
for
my
car
i
hit
the
car
clawed
myself
inside
wound
up
the
turbine
and
let
the
old
heap
in
gear
in
one
unbroken
series
of
motions
the
wheels
spun
and
sent
back
a
hail
of
gravel
then
they
took
a
bite
out
of
the
parking
lot
and
the
snapped
my
head
back
both
esper
and
eyesight
were
very
busy
a
crooked
course
through
the
parking
lot
between
the
parked
cars
and
the
trees
that
were
intended
to
lend
the
outfit
a
rustic
atmosphere
so
i
was
too
busy
to
take
more
than
a
vague
notice
of
a
hand
that
clamped
onto
the
doorframe
until
the
door
opened
and
closed
again
by
then
i
was
out
on
the
highway
and
i
could
relax
a
bit
steve
she
said
why
do
you
do
these
things
yeah
it
was
marian
harrison
i
did
ask
to
get
shoved
into
this
mess
i
growled
you
did
ask
to
be
born
either
she
said
i
did
think
the
argument
was
very
logical
and
i
said
so
life
was
too
hard
to
bear
until
i
met
you
people
i
told
her
sourly
life
would
be
very
pleasant
if
you
go
away
on
the
other
hand
life
is
all
i
got
and
it
far
better
than
the
alternative
so
if
making
your
life
miserable
that
goes
double
for
me
why
not
give
it
up
she
asked
me
i
stopped
the
car
i
eyed
her
dead
center
eye
to
eye
until
she
take
it
any
more
what
would
you
like
me
to
just
give
up
marian
shall
i
please
everybody
by
taking
a
bite
of
my
artillery
sights
whilst
testing
the
trigger
pull
with
one
forefinger
will
it
make
anybody
happy
if
i
walk
into
the
nearest
reorientation
museum
blowing
smoke
out
of
my
nose
and
claiming
that
i
am
a
teakettle
that
got
ta
be
taken
off
the
stove
before
i
blow
my
lid
marian
eyes
dropped
do
you
yourself
really
expect
me
to
seek
blessed
oblivion
she
shook
her
head
slowly
then
for
the
love
of
god
what
do
you
expect
of
me
i
roared
as
i
am
i
neither
flesh
nor
fish
just
foul
i
not
likely
to
give
up
marian
if
i
a
menace
to
you
and
to
your
kind
it
just
too
tough
but
if
you
want
me
out
of
your
hair
you
have
to
wrap
me
up
in
something
suitable
for
framing
and
haul
me
kicking
and
screaming
to
your
department
because
i
not
having
any
on
my
own
understand
i
understand
steve
she
said
softly
i
know
you
we
all
know
you
and
your
type
you
ca
give
up
you
unable
to
not
when
i
been
hypnoed
into
it
i
said
marian
head
tossed
disdainfully
thorndyke
hypnotic
suggestion
was
very
weak
she
explained
he
had
to
plant
the
idea
in
such
a
way
as
to
remain
unidentified
afterwards
no
steve
your
urge
has
always
been
your
own
personal
drive
all
that
thorndyke
did
was
to
point
you
slightly
in
our
direction
and
give
you
a
nudge
you
did
the
rest
well
you
a
telepath
maybe
you
also
capable
of
planting
a
suggestion
that
i
forget
the
whole
idea
i
not
she
said
with
a
sudden
flare
i
looked
at
her
not
being
a
telepath
i
could
read
a
single
thought
but
it
was
certain
that
she
was
telling
the
truth
and
telling
it
in
such
a
manner
as
to
be
convincing
finally
i
said
marian
if
you
know
that
i
not
to
be
changed
by
logic
or
argument
why
do
you
bother
for
a
full
minute
she
was
silent
then
her
eyes
came
up
and
gave
it
back
to
me
with
their
electric
blue
for
the
same
reason
that
scholar
phelps
hoped
to
use
you
against
us
she
said
your
fate
and
your
future
is
tied
up
with
ours
whether
you
turn
out
to
be
friend
or
enemy
i
grunted
sounds
like
a
soap
opera
marian
i
told
her
bitterly
will
catherine
find
solace
in
phillip
arms
will
steve
catch
mekstrom
disease
will
the
dastardly
scholar
phelps
stop
it
she
cried
all
right
i
stop
as
soon
as
you
tell
me
what
you
intend
to
do
with
me
now
that
you
caught
up
with
me
again
she
smiled
steve
i
going
along
with
you
partly
to
play
the
of
your
team
if
you
trust
me
to
deliver
the
truth
and
partly
to
see
that
you
do
get
into
trouble
that
you
ca
get
out
of
again
my
mind
curled
its
lip
pappy
had
tanned
my
landing
gear
until
i
was
out
of
the
habit
of
using
mother
for
protection
against
the
slings
and
arrows
of
outrageous
schoolchums
i
not
taken
sanctuary
behind
a
woman
skirts
since
i
was
eight
so
the
idea
of
running
under
the
protection
of
a
woman
went
against
the
grain
even
though
i
knew
that
she
was
my
physical
superior
by
no
sensible
proportion
being
cared
for
physically
by
a
dame
of
a
eighteen
did
sit
well
on
me
do
you
believe
me
steve
i
got
to
you
here
to
stay
i
a
sucker
for
a
woman
anyway
it
seems
they
tell
me
anything
and
i
not
hardhearted
enough
to
even
indicate
that
i
do
believe
them
she
took
my
arm
impulsively
then
she
let
me
go
before
she
pinched
it
off
at
the
elbow
steve
she
said
earnestly
believe
me
and
let
me
be
your
better
half
i
finished
sourly
please
do
she
said
plaintively
steve
you
simply
to
trust
i
looked
into
her
face
coldly
the
hardest
job
in
the
world
for
a
is
to
locate
someone
he
can
trust
the
next
hardest
is
to
explain
that
to
a
telepath
because
telepaths
ca
see
any
difficulty
in
weeding
out
the
now
you
still
have
faced
the
facts
neither
have
you
marian
you
intend
to
go
along
with
me
ostensibly
to
help
me
in
whatever
i
intend
to
do
that
fine
i
accept
it
but
you
know
good
and
well
that
i
intend
to
carry
on
and
on
until
something
cracks
now
tell
me
honestly
are
you
going
along
to
help
me
crack
something
wide
open
or
just
to
steer
me
into
channels
that
will
not
result
in
a
for
your
side
marian
harrison
looked
down
for
a
moment
i
did
need
telepathy
to
know
that
i
touched
the
sore
spot
then
she
looked
up
and
said
steve
more
than
anything
i
intend
to
keep
you
out
of
trouble
you
should
know
by
now
that
there
is
very
little
you
can
really
do
to
harm
either
side
of
our
own
private
little
war
and
if
i
ca
harm
either
side
i
can
hardly
do
either
side
any
she
nodded
yet
i
must
be
of
some
she
nodded
again
at
that
point
i
almost
gave
up
i
been
around
this
circle
so
many
times
in
the
past
that
i
knew
how
the
back
of
my
head
looked
always
the
same
old
question
le
i
thought
in
bum
french
something
i
had
was
important
enough
to
both
sides
to
make
them
keep
me
on
the
loose
instead
of
erasing
me
and
my
nuisance
value
so
far
as
i
could
see
i
was
as
useless
to
either
side
as
a
coat
of
protective
paint
laid
on
stainless
steel
i
was
immune
to
mekstrom
disease
the
immunity
of
one
who
has
had
everything
tried
on
him
that
scholars
of
the
disease
could
devise
about
the
only
thing
that
ever
took
place
was
the
sudden
disappearance
of
everybody
that
i
came
in
contact
with
marian
touched
my
arm
gently
you
must
think
like
that
steve
she
said
gently
you
done
enough
useless
ca
you
stop
accusing
yourself
of
some
evil
factor
something
that
really
is
not
so
not
until
i
know
the
truth
i
replied
i
certainly
ca
dig
it
no
telepath
perhaps
if
i
were
i
not
be
in
this
awkward
position
again
her
silence
proved
to
me
that
i
hit
a
touchy
spot
what
am
i
i
demanded
sourly
am
i
a
great
big
curse
what
have
i
done
other
than
to
be
present
just
before
several
people
turn
up
missing
makes
me
sort
of
a
male
typhoid
mary
does
it
now
steve
well
maybe
that
the
way
i
feel
everything
i
put
my
great
big
clutching
hands
on
turns
dark
green
and
starts
to
rot
regardless
of
which
side
they
on
it
goes
one
two
three
four
catherine
thorndyke
you
nurse
farrow
steve
what
on
earth
are
you
talking
about
i
smiled
down
at
her
in
a
crooked
sort
of
quirk
you
of
course
have
not
the
faintest
idea
of
what
i
thinking
oh
steve
and
then
again
maybe
you
doing
your
best
to
lead
my
puzzled
little
mind
away
from
what
you
consider
a
dangerous
subject
i
hardly
do
that
sure
you
would
i
do
it
if
our
positions
were
reversed
i
do
think
it
to
defend
one
own
personal
stand
marian
but
not
divert
me
this
time
i
have
a
hunch
that
i
am
a
sort
of
male
typhoid
mary
let
call
me
old
mekstrom
steve
the
carrier
of
disease
who
can
innocently
or
maliciously
go
around
handing
it
out
to
anybody
that
i
contact
is
that
it
marian
it
probably
excellent
logic
steve
but
it
is
true
i
eyed
her
coldly
how
can
i
possibly
believe
you
that
the
trouble
she
said
with
a
plaintive
cry
you
ca
got
to
believe
me
on
faith
steve
i
smiled
crookedly
marian
i
said
that
just
the
right
angle
to
take
since
i
can
not
read
your
mind
i
must
accept
the
old
appeal
to
the
emotions
i
must
tell
myself
that
marian
harrison
just
simply
could
not
lie
to
me
for
many
reasons
among
which
is
that
people
do
not
lie
to
blind
men
nor
cause
the
cripple
any
hurt
well
phooey
whatever
kind
of
gambit
is
being
played
here
it
is
bigger
than
any
of
its
parts
or
pieces
i
something
between
a
queen
and
a
pawn
marian
a
piece
that
can
be
sacrificed
at
any
time
to
further
the
progress
of
the
game
slipping
me
a
lie
or
two
to
cause
me
to
move
in
some
desired
direction
should
come
as
a
natural
but
why
would
we
lie
to
you
she
asked
and
then
she
bit
her
lip
i
think
that
she
slipped
that
she
had
intended
to
urge
me
into
deeper
consideration
of
the
problem
lest
i
succeed
in
making
a
sharp
analysis
after
all
the
way
to
keep
people
from
figuring
things
out
is
to
stop
them
from
thinking
about
the
subject
that
the
first
rule
next
comes
the
process
of
feeding
them
false
information
if
the
first
law
can
not
be
invoked
why
would
you
lie
to
me
i
replied
in
a
sort
of
sneer
i
did
really
want
to
sneer
but
it
came
naturally
in
an
earlier
age
it
might
not
be
necessary
what
she
asked
in
surprise
might
not
be
necessary
i
said
let
assume
that
we
are
living
in
the
before
rhine
steve
cornell
turns
up
being
a
carrier
of
a
disease
that
is
really
a
blessing
instead
of
a
curse
in
such
a
time
marian
either
side
could
sign
me
up
openly
as
a
sort
of
missionary
i
could
go
around
the
country
inoculating
the
right
people
those
citizens
who
have
the
right
kind
of
mind
attitude
or
following
me
could
be
a
corps
to
collect
the
wights
who
been
inoculated
by
my
contact
sounds
reasonable
does
it
without
waiting
for
either
protest
or
that
downcast
look
of
agreement
i
went
on
but
now
we
have
perception
and
telepathy
all
over
the
place
so
steve
cornell
the
carrier
must
be
pushed
around
from
pillar
to
post
meeting
people
and
inoculating
them
without
ever
knowing
what
he
is
doing
because
once
he
knows
what
he
is
doing
his
usefulness
is
ended
in
this
world
of
rhine
institute
steve
she
started
but
i
interrupted
again
about
all
i
have
to
do
now
is
to
walk
down
any
main
street
radiating
my
suspicions
i
said
bitterly
and
it
off
to
medical
center
for
steve
unless
the
highways
catch
me
first
very
quietly
marian
said
we
really
dislike
to
use
reorientation
on
people
it
changes
them
so
but
that
what
i
headed
for
is
it
i
demanded
flatly
i
sorry
steve
angrily
i
went
on
not
caring
that
i
finally
caught
on
and
by
doing
so
had
sealed
my
own
package
so
after
i
have
my
mind
ironed
out
smoothly
i
still
go
on
and
on
from
pillar
to
post
providing
newly
inoculated
mekstroms
for
your
squad
she
looked
up
at
me
and
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
we
were
all
hoping
she
started
were
you
i
asked
roughly
were
you
all
working
to
innoculate
me
at
homestead
or
were
you
really
studying
me
to
find
out
what
made
me
a
carrier
instead
of
a
victim
both
steve
she
said
and
there
was
a
ring
of
honesty
in
her
tone
i
had
to
believe
her
it
made
sense
dismal
prospect
is
it
i
asked
for
a
guy
that
done
nothing
wrong
we
all
sorry
look
i
said
with
a
sudden
thought
why
ca
i
still
go
on
i
could
start
a
way
station
of
some
sort
on
some
pretext
and
go
on
innoculating
the
public
as
they
come
past
then
i
could
go
on
working
for
you
and
still
keep
my
right
mind
she
shook
her
head
scholar
phelps
knows
she
said
above
all
things
we
must
keep
you
out
of
his
hands
he
use
you
for
his
own
purpose
i
grunted
sourly
he
has
already
and
he
will
again
i
told
her
not
only
that
but
phelps
has
had
plenty
of
chance
to
collect
me
on
or
off
the
hook
so
what
you
fear
does
not
make
sense
it
does
now
she
told
me
seriously
so
long
as
you
did
not
suspect
your
own
part
in
the
picture
you
could
do
more
good
for
phelps
by
running
free
now
you
know
and
phelps
careful
herding
of
your
motions
wo
work
do
get
it
watch
she
said
with
a
shrug
they
try
i
do
dare
experiment
steve
or
i
leave
you
right
now
you
find
out
very
shortly
that
you
with
me
because
i
got
here
first
and
knowing
the
score
makes
me
also
dangerous
to
your
highways
likely
to
bring
out
of
hiding
yes
so
now
that
i
dumped
over
the
old
apple
cart
i
can
assume
that
you
here
to
take
me
in
what
else
can
i
do
steve
she
said
unhappily
i
could
answer
that
i
just
sat
there
looking
at
her
and
trying
to
remember
that
her
shapely
one
hundred
and
eighteen
pounds
were
steel
hard
and
monster
strong
and
that
she
could
probably
carry
me
under
one
arm
all
the
way
to
homestead
without
breathing
hard
i
could
cut
and
run
she
could
outrun
me
i
could
slug
her
on
the
jaw
and
get
away
i
break
my
hand
the
bonanza
would
probably
stun
her
but
i
have
not
the
cold
blooded
viciousness
to
pull
a
gun
on
a
woman
and
drill
her
i
grunted
sourly
that
weapon
had
been
about
as
useful
to
me
as
a
stuffed
bear
or
an
authentic
egyptian
obelisk
well
i
not
going
i
said
stubbornly
she
looked
at
me
in
surprise
what
are
you
going
to
do
she
asked
me
i
felt
a
glow
of
if
i
could
not
run
loose
with
guilty
knowledge
of
my
being
a
mekstrom
carrier
it
was
equally
impossible
for
anybody
to
kidnap
me
and
carry
me
across
the
country
i
radiate
like
mad
i
complain
about
the
situation
at
every
crossroad
at
every
filling
station
before
every
farmer
i
complain
mentally
and
bitterly
and
sooner
or
later
someone
would
get
suspicious
do
think
like
an
idiot
she
told
me
sharply
you
drove
across
the
country
before
remember
how
many
people
did
you
convince
i
was
trying
then
how
about
the
people
in
the
hotel
in
denver
she
asked
me
pointedly
what
good
did
you
do
there
very
little
but
one
of
the
advantages
of
a
telepath
is
that
we
ca
be
taken
by
surprise
she
informed
me
because
no
one
can
possibly
work
without
plans
of
some
kind
one
of
the
troubles
of
a
telepath
i
told
her
right
back
is
that
they
get
so
confounded
used
to
knowing
what
is
going
to
happen
next
that
it
takes
all
the
pleasant
element
of
surprise
out
of
their
lives
that
makes
dull
and
the
element
of
surprise
came
in
through
the
back
window
passed
between
us
and
went
against
the
there
was
the
sound
like
someone
chipping
ice
with
a
spike
followed
by
the
distant
bark
of
a
rifle
a
second
slug
came
through
the
back
window
about
the
time
that
the
first
one
landed
on
the
floor
of
the
car
the
second
slug
not
slowed
by
the
glass
in
the
rear
went
through
the
glass
in
the
front
a
third
slug
passed
through
the
same
tunnel
these
were
warning
shots
he
missed
us
intentionally
he
proved
it
by
firing
three
times
through
the
same
hole
from
beyond
my
esper
range
i
wound
up
the
machinery
and
we
took
off
marian
cried
something
about
not
being
foolish
but
her
words
were
swept
out
through
the
hole
in
the
rear
window
just
above
the
marks
on
the
pavement
caused
by
my
tires
as
we
spun
the
wheels
xv
steve
stop
it
cried
marian
as
soon
as
she
could
get
her
breath
nuts
i
growled
i
took
a
long
curve
on
the
outside
wheels
and
ironed
out
again
he
is
after
our
corpse
honey
he
after
our
hide
i
do
care
for
any
the
fourth
shot
went
singing
off
the
pavement
to
one
side
it
whined
into
the
distance
making
that
noise
that
sets
the
teeth
on
edge
and
makes
one
want
to
duck
i
lowered
the
boom
on
the
go
pedal
and
tried
to
make
the
meter
read
off
the
far
end
of
the
scale
i
had
a
notion
that
the
guy
behind
might
shoot
the
tires
out
if
we
were
going
slow
enough
so
that
a
blowout
would
cause
a
bad
wreck
but
he
probably
would
do
it
once
i
got
the
speed
up
he
was
not
after
marian
marian
could
walk
out
of
any
without
a
bruise
but
i
could
we
went
roaring
around
a
curve
i
fought
the
wheel
into
a
nasty
double
curve
to
swing
out
and
around
a
truck
then
back
on
my
own
side
of
the
road
again
to
avoid
an
oncoming
car
i
could
almost
count
the
front
teeth
of
the
guy
driving
the
car
as
we
straightened
out
with
a
coat
of
varnish
to
spare
i
scared
everybody
in
all
three
vehicles
including
me
then
i
passed
a
couple
of
guys
standing
beside
the
road
one
of
them
waved
me
on
the
other
stood
there
peering
past
me
down
the
road
as
we
roared
by
another
group
on
the
other
side
of
the
highway
came
running
out
hauling
a
big
old
hay
wagon
they
set
the
wagon
across
the
road
and
then
sloped
into
the
ditch
on
either
side
of
it
i
managed
to
dig
the
bare
glimmer
of
firearms
before
i
had
to
yank
my
perception
away
from
them
and
slam
it
back
on
the
road
in
front
i
was
none
too
soon
because
dead
ahead
by
a
thousand
feet
or
so
they
were
hauling
a
second
road
block
out
marian
not
possessed
of
esper
cried
out
as
soon
as
she
read
this
new
menace
in
my
mind
i
rode
the
brakes
easily
and
came
to
a
stop
long
before
we
hit
it
in
back
sounded
a
crackle
of
rifle
fire
in
front
three
men
came
out
waving
their
rifles
at
us
i
whipped
the
car
back
spun
it
in
a
seesaw
and
took
off
back
towards
the
first
road
block
half
way
back
i
whirled
my
car
into
a
rough
sideroad
just
as
the
left
hand
rear
tire
went
out
with
a
roar
the
car
sagged
and
dragged
me
to
a
stop
with
my
nose
in
a
little
ditch
the
heap
had
stopped
rocking
yet
before
i
was
out
and
on
the
run
steve
cried
marian
come
back
to
heck
with
i
kept
right
on
running
before
me
by
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
was
a
thicket
of
trees
i
headed
that
way
fast
i
managed
to
sling
a
dig
back
marian
was
joining
the
others
pointing
in
my
direction
one
of
them
raised
the
rifle
but
she
knocked
it
down
i
went
on
running
it
looked
as
though
i
be
all
right
so
long
as
i
did
get
in
the
way
of
an
accidental
shot
my
life
was
once
more
charmed
with
the
fact
that
no
one
wanted
me
dead
the
thicket
of
woods
was
not
as
thick
as
i
have
liked
from
a
distance
they
seemed
almost
impenetrable
but
when
i
was
running
through
them
towards
the
center
they
looked
pitifully
thin
i
could
see
light
from
any
direction
and
the
floor
of
the
woods
was
trimmed
the
underbrush
cleaned
out
and
a
lot
of
it
was
tramped
down
ahead
of
me
i
perceived
a
few
of
them
coming
towards
the
woods
warily
behind
me
there
was
another
gang
closing
in
i
began
to
feel
like
the
caterpillar
on
the
blade
of
grass
in
front
of
the
lawn
mower
i
tried
to
hide
under
a
deadfall
knowing
that
it
was
poor
protection
against
rifle
fire
i
hauled
out
the
bonanza
and
checked
the
cylinder
i
did
know
which
side
i
was
going
to
shoot
at
but
that
did
bother
me
i
was
going
to
shoot
at
the
first
side
that
got
close
a
couple
of
shots
whipped
by
over
my
head
making
noises
like
someone
snapping
a
bullwhip
i
could
tell
which
direction
they
came
from
i
was
too
busy
trying
to
stuff
my
feet
into
a
gopher
hole
under
my
deadfall
i
cast
around
the
thicket
with
my
sense
of
perception
and
caught
the
layout
both
sides
were
spread
out
stalking
forward
like
infantry
advancing
through
disputed
ground
now
and
then
one
of
them
would
raise
his
rifle
and
fire
at
some
unexpected
motion
this
i
gathered
was
more
nervousness
than
fighting
skill
because
no
group
of
telepaths
perceptives
would
be
so
jittery
on
the
trigger
if
they
were
basically
nervous
they
should
as
i
did
have
the
absolute
position
of
both
the
enemy
and
their
own
side
with
a
growing
nervous
sweat
i
dug
their
advances
they
were
avoiding
my
position
trying
to
encircle
me
by
making
long
semicircular
marches
hoping
to
get
between
me
and
the
other
side
this
was
a
rough
maneuver
sort
of
like
two
telepaths
playing
chess
both
sides
knew
to
a
minute
exactly
what
the
other
had
in
mind
where
he
was
and
what
he
was
going
to
do
about
his
position
but
they
kept
shifting
feinting
and
trying
to
gain
the
advantage
of
number
or
position
so
that
the
other
would
be
forced
to
retreat
it
became
a
war
of
nerves
a
game
of
seeing
who
had
the
most
guts
who
could
walk
closer
to
the
muzzle
of
an
enemy
rifle
without
getting
hit
their
rifles
were
mixed
there
were
a
couple
of
deer
guns
a
nice
express
that
fired
a
slug
slightly
smaller
than
a
panetella
cigar
a
few
shotguns
a
carbine
sports
rifle
that
looked
like
it
might
have
been
a
garand
with
the
barrel
shortened
by
a
couple
of
inches
some
revolvers
one
colt
automatic
and
so
on
i
shivered
down
in
my
little
hideout
as
soon
as
the
shooting
started
in
earnest
they
were
going
to
clean
out
this
woods
but
good
it
was
going
to
be
a
fine
barrage
with
guns
going
off
in
all
directions
because
it
is
hard
to
keep
your
head
in
a
melee
esper
and
telepathy
go
by
the
board
when
shooting
starts
i
still
did
know
which
side
was
which
the
gang
behind
me
were
friends
of
marian
harrison
but
that
did
not
endear
them
to
me
any
more
than
knowing
that
the
gang
in
front
were
from
scholar
phelps
medical
center
or
some
group
affiliated
with
him
in
the
midst
of
it
i
managed
to
bet
myself
a
new
hat
that
old
scholar
phelps
did
really
know
what
was
going
on
he
would
be
cagey
enough
to
stay
ignorant
of
any
overt
strife
or
any
other
skullduggery
that
could
be
laid
at
his
door
then
on
one
edge
of
the
woodsy
section
two
guys
of
equal
advanced
came
up
standing
and
faced
one
another
across
fifty
feet
of
open
woods
their
rifles
came
up
and
yelled
at
one
another
like
a
string
of
firecrackers
they
wasted
a
lot
of
powder
and
lead
by
not
taking
careful
aim
one
of
them
emptied
his
rifle
and
started
to
fade
back
to
reload
the
other
let
him
have
it
in
the
shoulder
it
spun
the
guy
around
and
dumped
him
on
his
spine
his
outflung
hand
slammed
his
rifle
against
a
tree
which
broke
it
he
gave
a
painful
moan
and
started
to
crawl
back
his
arm
hanging
but
not
broken
from
behind
me
came
a
roar
and
a
peltering
of
shotgun
pellets
through
the
trees
it
was
answered
by
the
heavy
bark
of
the
express
i
sure
that
in
the
entire
artillery
present
the
only
rifle
heavy
enough
to
really
damage
those
mekstroms
was
that
express
which
would
stop
a
charging
rhino
when
you
get
down
to
facts
my
bonanza
packed
a
terrific
wallop
but
it
did
not
have
the
shocking
power
of
the
heavy
rifle
motion
caught
my
perception
to
one
side
two
of
them
had
let
go
shotgun
blasts
from
guns
they
were
standing
face
to
face
swinging
their
guns
like
a
pair
of
axemen
swing
chop
swing
chop
and
with
each
swing
their
guns
were
losing
shape
splinters
from
the
butts
and
bits
of
machinery
their
clothing
was
in
ribbons
from
the
shotgun
blasts
but
neither
of
them
seemed
willing
to
give
up
there
was
not
a
sign
of
blood
only
a
few
places
on
each
belly
that
looked
on
the
other
side
of
me
one
guy
let
go
with
a
rifle
that
slugged
the
other
bird
in
the
middle
he
folded
over
the
shot
and
his
middle
went
back
and
down
which
whipped
his
head
over
back
and
down
where
it
hit
the
ground
with
an
audible
thump
the
first
guy
leaped
forward
just
as
the
victim
of
his
attack
sat
up
rubbed
his
belly
ruefully
and
drew
a
hunting
knife
with
his
other
hand
the
first
guy
took
a
running
dive
at
the
supine
one
who
swung
the
hunting
knife
in
a
vicious
arc
the
point
hit
the
chest
of
the
man
coming
through
the
air
but
it
stopped
as
though
the
man
had
been
wearing
plate
armor
you
could
dig
the
return
shock
that
stunned
the
arm
when
the
point
turned
all
it
did
was
rip
the
clothing
then
the
pair
of
them
were
at
it
in
a
that
made
the
woods
ring
this
deadly
combat
did
not
last
long
one
of
them
took
aim
with
a
fist
and
let
the
other
have
it
the
rifle
shot
had
stopped
him
but
the
hard
fist
of
another
mekstrom
laid
him
out
colder
than
a
mackerel
iced
for
shipment
the
deadly
express
roared
again
and
there
started
a
concentration
of
troops
heading
towards
the
point
of
origin
i
had
a
hunch
that
the
other
side
did
not
like
anybody
to
be
playing
quite
as
rough
as
a
gun
someone
might
really
get
hurt
by
now
they
were
all
in
close
and
swinging
now
and
then
someone
would
stand
off
and
gain
a
few
moments
of
breathing
space
by
letting
go
with
a
shotgun
or
knocking
someone
off
of
his
feet
with
a
carbine
there
was
some
bloodshed
too
not
all
these
shots
bounced
but
from
what
i
could
perceive
none
of
them
were
fatal
just
painful
the
guy
who
been
stopped
first
with
the
rifle
slug
and
then
the
other
mekstrom
fist
was
still
out
cold
and
bleeding
lightly
from
the
place
in
his
stomach
a
bit
horrified
i
perceived
that
the
pellet
was
embedded
about
a
in
the
two
birds
who
been
hacking
at
one
another
with
the
remains
of
their
shotguns
had
settled
it
barehanded
too
the
loser
was
groaning
and
trying
to
pull
himself
together
the
shiny
spots
on
his
chest
were
shotgun
pellets
stuck
in
the
skin
it
was
one
heck
of
a
fight
mekstroms
could
play
with
guns
and
knives
and
go
around
taking
swings
at
one
another
with
hunks
of
tree
or
clubbed
rifles
or
they
could
stand
off
and
hurl
boulders
such
a
battlefield
was
no
place
for
a
guy
named
steve
cornell
by
now
all
good
sense
and
fine
management
was
gone
if
i
been
spotted
they
have
taken
a
swing
at
me
forgetting
that
i
am
no
mekstrom
so
i
decided
that
it
was
time
for
steve
to
leave
i
cast
about
me
with
my
perception
the
gang
that
marian
had
joined
had
advanced
until
they
were
almost
even
with
my
central
position
there
were
a
couple
of
swinging
matches
to
either
side
and
one
in
front
of
me
i
wondered
about
marian
somehow
i
still
do
like
seeing
a
woman
tangled
up
in
a
marian
was
out
of
esper
range
which
was
all
right
with
me
i
crawled
out
of
my
hideout
cautiously
stood
up
in
a
low
crouch
and
began
to
run
a
couple
of
them
caught
sight
of
me
and
put
up
a
howl
but
they
were
too
busy
with
their
personal
foe
to
take
off
after
me
one
of
them
was
free
i
doubled
him
up
and
dropped
him
on
his
back
with
a
slug
from
my
bonanza
somehow
it
did
not
seem
rough
or
vicious
to
shoot
since
there
was
nothing
lethal
in
it
it
was
more
like
a
game
of
cowboy
and
indian
than
deadly
earnest
warfare
then
i
was
out
and
free
of
them
all
out
of
the
woods
and
running
like
a
deer
i
cursed
the
car
with
its
blown
out
tire
the
old
crate
had
been
a
fine
bus
nicely
broken
in
and
conveniently
fast
but
it
was
as
useful
to
me
now
as
a
pair
of
skids
a
couple
of
them
behind
me
caught
on
and
gave
chase
i
heard
cries
for
me
to
stop
which
i
ignored
like
any
sensible
man
someone
cut
loose
with
a
roar
the
big
slug
from
the
express
whipped
past
and
went
off
a
rock
somewhere
ahead
it
only
added
a
few
more
feet
per
second
to
my
flight
if
they
were
going
to
play
that
rough
i
did
care
to
stay
i
fired
an
unaimed
shot
over
my
shoulder
which
did
no
good
at
all
except
for
lifting
my
morale
i
hoped
that
it
would
slow
them
a
bit
but
if
it
did
i
could
tell
then
i
leaped
over
a
ditch
and
came
upon
a
cluster
of
cars
i
dug
at
them
as
i
approached
and
selected
one
of
the
faster
models
that
still
had
its
key
dangling
from
the
lock
i
was
in
and
off
and
away
as
fast
as
a
scared
man
can
move
they
were
still
yelling
and
fighting
in
the
woods
when
i
raced
out
of
my
range
the
heap
i
jumped
was
a
clinton
special
with
springs
and
a
low
slung
frame
that
hugged
the
ground
like
a
clam
i
was
intent
upon
putting
as
many
miles
as
i
could
between
me
and
the
late
engagement
in
as
short
a
time
as
possible
and
the
clinton
seemed
especially
apt
until
i
remembered
that
the
figure
on
the
dial
meant
kilometers
instead
of
miles
per
hour
then
i
let
her
out
a
bit
more
and
tried
for
the
end
of
the
dial
the
clinton
tried
with
me
and
i
had
to
keep
my
esper
carefully
aimed
at
the
road
ahead
because
i
was
definitely
overdriving
my
eyesight
and
i
was
so
intent
upon
making
feet
that
i
did
not
notice
the
jetcopter
that
came
swooping
down
over
my
head
until
the
howl
of
its
raised
hell
with
my
eardrums
then
i
slowed
the
car
and
lifted
my
perception
at
the
same
time
for
a
quick
dig
the
jetcopter
was
painted
policeman
blue
and
it
sported
a
large
on
its
side
and
inside
the
cabin
were
two
gentlemen
wearing
uniforms
with
brass
buttons
and
that
old
bailey
look
in
their
eye
the
one
on
the
left
was
jingling
a
pair
of
handcuffs
they
passed
over
my
head
at
about
fifteen
feet
swooped
on
past
by
a
thousand
and
dropped
a
bomb
it
flared
briefly
and
let
out
with
a
billow
of
thick
red
smoke
i
leaned
on
the
brakes
hard
enough
to
stand
the
clinton
up
on
its
nose
because
if
i
shoved
my
front
bumper
through
that
cloud
of
red
smoke
it
was
a
signal
for
them
to
let
me
have
it
i
came
to
a
stop
about
a
foot
this
side
of
the
bomb
and
the
jetcopter
came
down
hovering
its
vanes
blew
the
smoke
away
and
the
landed
in
front
of
my
swiped
clinton
special
the
policeman
was
both
curt
and
angry
driver
ticket
registration
and
maybe
your
pilot
license
he
snapped
well
that
was
i
had
a
driver
ticket
all
right
it
did
not
permit
me
to
drive
a
car
that
i
selected
out
of
a
group
willy
nilly
the
car
registration
was
in
the
glove
compartment
where
it
was
supposed
to
be
but
what
it
said
did
not
match
what
the
driver
license
claimed
no
matter
what
i
said
there
would
be
the
devil
to
pay
i
go
quietly
officer
i
told
him
darn
white
of
you
pilot
he
said
cynically
he
was
scribbling
on
a
book
of
tickets
and
it
was
piling
up
deep
speeding
reckless
driving
violation
of
ordinance
by
number
driving
a
car
without
proper
registration
in
the
absence
of
the
rightful
owner
check
for
stolen
car
records
and
so
on
and
on
and
on
until
it
looked
like
a
life
term
in
the
local
jug
move
over
cornell
he
said
curtly
i
taking
you
in
i
moved
politely
the
only
time
it
pays
to
be
arrogant
with
the
police
is
long
after
you
proved
them
wrong
and
then
only
when
you
facing
your
mirror
at
home
telling
yourself
what
you
should
have
said
i
was
driven
to
court
escorted
in
by
the
pair
of
them
and
seated
with
one
on
each
side
the
sign
on
the
judge
table
said
magistrate
hollister
magistrate
hollister
was
an
elderly
gentleman
with
a
cast
iron
jaw
and
a
glance
as
cold
as
a
bucket
of
snow
he
dealt
justice
with
a
shovel
and
his
attitude
seemed
to
be
that
everybody
was
either
guilty
as
charged
or
was
contemplating
some
form
of
evil
to
be
committed
as
soon
as
he
was
out
of
the
sight
of
justice
i
sat
there
squirming
while
he
piled
the
top
on
a
couple
whose
only
crime
was
parking
overtime
i
itched
from
top
to
bottom
while
he
slapped
one
miscreant
in
gaol
for
turning
left
in
violation
of
city
ordinance
his
next
attempt
gave
a
ten
dollar
fine
for
failing
to
come
to
a
full
and
grinding
halt
at
the
sign
of
the
big
red
light
despite
the
fact
that
the
criminal
was
esper
to
a
fine
degree
and
dug
the
fact
that
there
was
no
for
a
half
mile
then
his
honor
licked
his
chops
and
called
my
name
he
speared
me
with
an
and
asked
sarcastically
well
cornell
with
what
form
of
sophistry
are
you
going
to
explain
your
recent
violations
i
blinked
he
aimed
a
cold
glance
at
the
bailiff
who
arose
and
read
off
the
charges
against
me
in
a
deep
hollow
intonation
speak
up
he
snapped
are
you
guilty
or
not
guilty
guilty
i
admitted
he
beamed
a
sort
of
evil
it
was
easy
to
see
that
never
in
his
tenure
of
office
had
he
ever
encountered
a
criminal
as
hardened
and
as
vicious
as
i
nor
one
who
admitted
to
his
turpitude
so
blandly
i
felt
it
coming
and
it
made
me
itch
and
i
knew
that
if
i
tried
to
scratch
his
honor
would
take
the
act
as
a
personal
affront
i
fought
down
the
crazy
desire
to
scratch
everything
i
could
reach
and
it
was
hard
about
the
time
his
honor
added
a
charge
of
endangering
human
life
on
the
highway
to
the
rest
of
my
assorted
crimes
the
itch
had
localized
into
the
ring
finger
of
my
left
hand
that
i
could
scratch
by
rubbing
it
against
the
seam
of
my
trousers
then
his
honor
went
on
delivering
lecture
number
seven
on
crime
delinquency
and
grand
larceny
i
was
going
to
be
an
example
he
vowed
i
was
assumed
to
be
esper
since
no
normal
that
the
word
he
used
which
indicated
that
the
old
bird
was
a
blank
and
hated
everybody
who
was
human
being
would
be
able
to
drive
as
though
he
had
eyes
mounted
a
half
mile
in
front
of
him
not
that
my
useless
life
was
in
danger
or
that
i
was
actually
of
my
car
but
that
my
actions
made
for
panic
among
normal
again
he
used
it
people
who
were
not
blessed
with
either
telepathy
or
perception
by
a
mere
accident
of
birth
the
last
one
proved
it
it
was
not
an
accident
of
birth
so
much
as
it
was
proper
training
to
my
way
of
thinking
magistrate
hollister
hated
people
and
was
out
to
make
examples
of
them
he
polished
off
his
lecture
by
pronouncing
sentence
and
the
law
provides
punishment
by
a
fine
not
to
exceed
one
thousand
dollars
or
a
sentence
of
ninety
days
in
jail
he
rolled
the
latter
off
as
though
he
relished
the
sound
of
the
words
i
waited
impatiently
the
itch
on
my
finger
increased
i
flung
a
fast
dig
at
it
but
there
was
nothing
there
but
sophomore
syndrome
good
old
nervous
association
it
was
the
finger
that
little
snoodles
the
baby
supergirl
had
munched
to
a
faretheewell
darned
good
thing
the
kid
did
have
teeth
but
i
was
old
steve
the
immune
the
carrier
the
well
mr
cornell
i
blinked
yes
your
honor
which
will
it
be
i
am
granting
you
the
leniency
of
selecting
which
penalty
you
prefer
i
could
probably
rake
up
a
thousand
by
selling
some
stock
personal
possessions
and
draining
my
bank
account
the
most
valuable
of
my
possessions
was
parked
in
a
ditch
with
a
blowout
and
probably
a
bent
frame
and
even
so
i
only
owned
about
six
monthly
payments
worth
of
it
your
honor
i
will
prefer
to
pay
the
fine
if
you
grant
me
time
in
which
to
go
and
collect
he
rapped
his
desk
with
his
gavel
cornell
he
boomed
angrily
a
thief
can
not
be
trusted
within
a
matter
of
minutes
you
could
remove
yourself
from
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
unless
a
binding
penalty
is
placed
against
your
person
you
may
go
on
your
search
for
money
but
only
after
posting
bond
to
the
same
amount
as
your
fine
however
unless
you
are
able
to
pay
i
have
no
recourse
but
to
exact
the
prison
sentence
of
ninety
days
bailiff
i
gave
up
it
even
felt
sort
of
good
to
give
up
especially
when
the
turn
is
called
by
someone
too
big
to
be
argued
with
no
matter
what
i
was
going
to
take
ninety
days
off
during
which
i
could
sit
and
think
and
plan
and
wonder
and
chew
my
fingernails
the
itch
in
my
finger
burned
again
deep
this
time
and
not
at
all
easy
to
satisfy
by
rubbing
it
against
my
trousers
i
picked
at
it
with
the
thumbnail
and
the
nail
caught
something
hard
i
looked
down
at
the
itching
finger
and
sent
my
perception
into
it
with
as
much
concentration
as
i
could
my
thumbnail
had
lifted
a
tiny
circle
no
larger
than
the
head
of
a
pin
blood
was
oozing
from
beneath
the
lifted
rim
and
i
nervously
picked
off
the
tiny
patch
of
hard
hard
flesh
and
watched
the
surface
blood
well
out
into
a
tiny
droplet
my
perception
told
me
the
truth
it
was
mekstrom
disease
and
not
a
doubt
the
immune
had
caught
it
the
bailiff
tapped
me
on
the
shoulder
and
said
come
along
cornell
and
i
was
going
to
have
ninety
days
to
watch
that
patch
grow
at
the
inexorable
rate
of
one
of
an
inch
per
hour
xvi
the
bailiff
repeated
come
along
cornell
then
he
added
sourly
or
i
have
to
slip
the
cuffs
on
you
i
turned
with
a
helpless
shrug
i
tried
to
lick
and
i
tried
to
join
and
i
failed
both
then
as
of
this
instant
when
i
might
have
been
able
to
go
join
i
was
headed
for
the
wrong
side
as
soon
as
i
opened
my
big
yap
and
if
i
did
yelp
i
was
a
dead
one
anyway
sooner
or
later
someone
in
the
local
jug
would
latch
on
to
my
condition
and
pack
me
off
to
scholar
phelps
medical
center
once
more
i
was
in
a
situation
where
all
i
could
do
was
to
play
it
by
ear
wait
for
a
break
and
see
if
i
could
make
something
out
of
it
but
before
i
could
take
more
than
a
step
or
two
toward
the
big
door
someone
in
the
back
of
the
courtroom
called
out
your
honor
i
have
some
vital
information
in
this
case
his
honor
looked
up
across
the
court
with
a
great
amount
of
irritation
showing
in
his
face
his
voice
rasped
indeed
i
whirled
shocked
suavely
thorndyke
strode
down
the
aisle
he
faced
the
judge
and
explained
who
he
was
and
why
then
he
backed
it
up
with
a
wallet
full
of
credentials
cards
identification
and
so
forth
the
judge
looked
the
shebang
over
sourly
but
finally
nodded
agreement
thorndyke
smiled
and
then
went
on
facing
me
it
would
be
against
my
duty
to
permit
you
to
incarcerate
this
miscreant
he
said
smoothly
because
cornell
has
disease
everybody
faded
back
and
away
from
me
as
though
he
announced
me
to
be
the
carrier
of
plague
they
looked
at
me
with
horror
and
disgust
on
their
faces
a
couple
of
them
began
to
wipe
their
hands
with
handkerchiefs
one
guy
who
been
standing
where
i
dropped
my
little
patch
of
mekstrom
flesh
backed
out
of
that
uncharmed
circle
some
of
the
spectators
left
hurriedly
his
honor
paled
you
certain
he
demanded
of
thorndyke
i
certain
you
note
the
blood
on
his
finger
cornell
recently
picked
off
a
patch
of
mekstrom
flesh
no
larger
than
the
head
of
a
pin
it
was
his
first
sign
the
doctor
went
on
explaining
normally
this
early
seizure
would
be
difficult
to
detect
except
from
a
clinical
examination
but
since
i
am
telepath
and
cornell
has
perception
his
own
mind
told
me
he
was
aware
of
his
sorry
condition
one
only
need
read
his
mind
or
to
dig
at
the
tiny
bit
of
mekstrom
flesh
that
he
dropped
to
your
floor
the
judge
eyed
me
nastily
maybe
i
should
add
a
charge
of
contaminating
a
courtroom
he
muttered
he
was
running
his
eyes
across
the
floor
from
me
to
wherever
i
been
trying
to
locate
the
little
patch
i
helped
him
by
not
looking
at
it
the
rest
of
the
court
faded
back
from
me
still
farther
i
could
hardly
have
been
less
admired
if
i
been
made
of
pure
cyanide
gas
the
judge
rapped
his
gavel
sharply
i
parole
this
prisoner
in
the
custody
of
thorndyke
who
as
a
representative
of
the
medical
center
will
remove
the
prisoner
to
that
place
where
the
proper
treatment
awaits
him
now
see
here
i
started
but
his
honor
cut
me
off
you
go
as
i
say
he
snapped
unfortunately
the
law
does
not
permit
me
to
enjoy
any
cruel
or
unusual
punishments
or
i
insist
upon
your
sentence
and
watch
you
die
painfully
i
bailiff
remove
this
menace
before
i
forget
my
position
here
and
find
myself
in
contempt
of
the
law
i
have
sworn
to
uphold
i
can
not
be
impartial
before
a
man
who
contaminates
my
court
with
the
world
most
dangerous
disease
i
turned
to
thorndyke
all
right
i
grunted
you
win
he
smiled
again
i
wanted
to
wipe
that
smile
away
with
a
set
of
knuckles
but
i
knew
that
all
i
get
would
be
a
broken
hand
against
flesh
now
cornell
he
said
with
that
clinical
smoothness
let
not
get
the
old
standard
attitude
nearly
everybody
who
contracts
mekstrom
disease
he
said
to
the
judge
takes
on
a
persecution
complex
as
soon
as
he
finds
out
that
he
has
it
some
of
them
have
even
accused
me
of
fomenting
some
big
fantastic
plot
against
them
please
cornell
he
went
on
facing
me
we
give
you
the
best
of
treatment
that
medical
science
knows
yeah
i
grunted
his
honor
rapped
on
the
gavel
once
more
officer
gruenwald
he
snapped
you
will
accompany
the
prisoner
and
thorndyke
to
the
medical
center
and
having
done
that
you
will
return
to
report
to
me
that
you
have
accomplished
your
mission
then
the
judge
glared
around
rapped
once
more
and
cried
case
finished
next
case
i
felt
almost
as
sorry
for
the
next
guy
coming
in
as
i
felt
for
myself
his
honor
was
going
to
be
one
tough
baby
for
some
days
to
come
as
they
escorted
me
out
a
janitor
came
in
and
began
to
swab
the
floor
where
been
standing
he
was
using
something
nicely
corrosive
that
made
the
icy
judicial
eyes
water
all
of
which
discomfort
was
likely
to
be
added
to
the
next
sorry
lot
i
was
in
fine
company
thorndyke
was
a
telepath
and
officer
gruenwald
was
perceptive
they
went
as
a
team
and
gave
me
about
as
much
chance
to
escape
as
if
i
been
a
horned
toad
sealed
in
a
cornerstone
gruenwald
of
course
treated
me
as
though
my
breath
was
deadly
my
touch
foul
and
my
presence
evil
in
gruenwald
eyes
the
only
difference
between
me
and
medusa
the
gorgon
was
that
looking
at
me
did
not
turn
him
to
stone
he
kept
at
least
one
eye
on
me
almost
constantly
i
could
almost
perceive
thorndyke
amusement
with
the
best
of
social
amenities
he
could
hardly
have
spent
a
full
waking
day
in
the
company
of
either
a
telepath
or
a
perceptive
without
giving
away
the
fact
that
he
was
mekstrom
but
with
me
to
watch
over
officer
gruenwald
mental
attention
was
not
to
be
turned
aside
to
take
an
impolite
dig
at
his
companion
even
if
he
had
thorndyke
would
have
been
there
quickly
to
turn
his
attention
aside
i
read
the
early
books
that
contain
predictions
of
how
we
are
supposed
to
operate
the
old
boys
seemed
to
have
the
quaint
notion
that
a
telepath
should
be
able
at
once
to
know
everything
that
goes
on
everywhere
and
a
perceptive
should
be
aware
of
everything
material
about
him
there
should
be
no
privacy
there
was
to
be
no
defense
against
the
mental
peeping
tom
it
ai
necessarily
so
if
gruenwald
had
taken
a
dig
at
hide
the
doctor
would
have
speared
the
policeman
with
a
cold
indignant
eye
and
called
him
for
it
of
course
there
was
no
good
reason
for
gruenwald
to
take
a
dig
at
thorndyke
and
so
he
did
so
i
went
along
with
the
status
quo
and
tried
to
think
of
some
way
to
break
it
up
an
hour
later
i
was
still
thinking
and
the
bleeding
on
my
finger
had
stopped
mekstrom
flesh
had
covered
the
raw
spot
with
a
thin
plate
that
could
not
be
separated
visually
from
the
rest
of
my
skin
as
a
perceptive
observed
thorndyke
in
a
professional
tone
you
notice
the
patch
of
infection
growing
on
cornell
finger
the
rate
of
growth
seems
normal
i
have
to
check
it
accurately
once
i
get
him
to
the
clinic
in
fifty
or
sixty
hours
cornell
finger
will
be
solid
to
the
first
joint
in
ninety
days
his
arm
will
have
become
as
solid
as
the
arm
of
a
marble
statue
i
interjected
and
what
do
we
do
about
it
he
moved
his
head
a
bit
and
eyed
me
in
the
rear
view
mirror
i
hope
we
can
help
you
cornell
he
said
in
a
tone
of
sympathy
that
was
definitely
intended
to
impress
officer
gruenwald
with
his
medical
appreciation
of
the
doctor
debt
to
humanity
i
sincerely
hope
so
for
in
doing
so
we
will
serve
the
human
race
and
he
admitted
with
an
entirely
selfishness
i
may
be
able
to
deliver
a
thesis
on
the
cure
that
will
qualify
me
for
my
scholarate
i
took
a
fast
stab
doctor
how
does
my
flesh
differ
from
yours
thorndyke
parried
this
question
mine
is
of
no
consequence
dig
your
own
above
and
below
the
line
of
infection
cornell
if
your
sense
of
perception
has
been
trained
fine
enough
dig
the
actual
line
of
infection
and
watch
the
molecular
structure
rearrange
can
you
dig
that
fine
officer
cornell
i
hate
to
dwell
at
length
upon
your
misfortune
but
perhaps
i
can
help
you
face
it
by
bringing
the
facts
to
light
like
the
devil
you
hate
to
dwell
doctor
mekstrom
in
the
rear
view
mirror
his
lips
parted
in
a
bland
smile
and
one
eyelid
dropped
in
a
knowing
wink
i
opened
my
mouth
to
make
another
stab
in
the
open
but
thorndyke
got
there
first
officer
gruenwald
he
suggested
you
can
help
by
putting
out
your
perception
along
the
road
ahead
and
seeing
how
it
goes
like
to
make
tracks
with
this
crate
gruenwald
nodded
thorndyke
put
the
down
and
the
car
took
off
with
a
howl
of
passing
wind
he
said
with
a
grin
it
is
very
often
that
i
get
a
chance
to
drive
like
this
but
as
long
as
i
an
officer
with
me
he
was
above
one
forty
by
the
time
he
let
his
voice
trail
off
i
watched
the
back
of
their
heads
for
a
moment
at
this
speed
thorndyke
would
have
both
his
mind
and
his
hands
full
and
the
cop
would
be
digging
at
the
road
as
far
ahead
as
his
perception
could
dig
a
clear
appreciation
of
the
road
and
its
hazards
thorndyke
telepathy
would
be
occupied
in
taking
this
perception
and
using
it
that
left
me
free
to
think
i
cast
a
dig
behind
me
as
far
behind
me
as
my
perception
would
reach
nothing
i
thought
furiously
it
resulted
in
nothing
i
needed
either
a
parachute
or
a
full
set
of
mekstrom
hide
to
get
out
of
this
car
now
with
either
i
might
have
taken
a
chance
and
jumped
but
as
it
was
the
only
guy
who
could
scramble
out
of
this
car
was
james
thorndyke
i
caught
his
dropping
eyelid
in
the
rear
view
mirror
again
and
swore
at
him
under
my
breath
time
and
miles
went
past
one
after
the
other
very
fast
we
hissed
through
towns
where
the
streets
had
been
opened
for
us
and
along
broad
stretches
of
highway
and
between
cars
and
trucks
running
at
normal
speeds
one
thing
i
must
say
for
thorndyke
he
was
almost
as
good
a
driver
as
i
my
second
arrival
at
the
medical
center
was
rather
quiet
i
went
in
the
service
entrance
so
to
speak
and
did
get
a
look
at
the
enamelled
blonde
at
the
front
portal
they
whiffed
me
in
at
a
broad
gate
that
was
opened
by
a
flunky
and
we
drove
for
another
mile
through
the
grounds
far
from
the
main
road
we
ended
up
in
front
of
a
small
brick
building
and
as
we
went
through
the
front
office
into
a
private
place
thorndyke
told
a
secretary
that
she
should
prepare
a
legal
receipt
for
my
person
i
did
not
like
being
bandied
about
like
a
hunk
of
merchandise
but
nobody
seemed
to
care
what
i
thought
it
was
all
very
fast
and
efficient
barely
seated
myself
and
lit
a
cigarette
when
the
nurse
came
in
with
the
document
which
thorndyke
signed
she
witnessed
and
was
subsequently
handed
to
officer
gruenwald
is
there
any
danger
of
me
er
contracting
he
faltered
uncertainly
to
thorndyke
you
notice
that
i
started
to
call
attention
to
calmness
at
being
in
my
presence
and
was
going
to
invite
gruenwald
to
take
a
dig
at
the
doctor
hide
but
once
more
the
doctor
blocked
me
none
of
us
have
ever
found
any
factor
of
contagion
he
said
and
we
live
among
mekstrom
cases
you
notice
miss
clifton
lack
of
concern
miss
clifton
the
nurse
turned
a
calm
face
to
the
policeman
and
gave
him
her
hand
miss
clifton
had
a
face
and
a
figure
that
was
enough
to
make
a
man
forget
anything
she
knew
her
part
very
well
together
the
nurse
and
the
policeman
left
the
office
together
and
i
wondered
just
why
a
would
have
anything
to
do
with
an
outfit
like
this
thorndyke
smiled
and
said
i
wo
tell
you
steve
what
you
do
know
wo
hurt
anybody
mind
telling
me
what
i
slated
for
the
high
jump
going
to
watch
me
writhing
in
pain
as
my
infection
climbs
toward
my
vitals
going
to
amputate
or
are
you
going
to
cut
it
off
inch
by
inch
and
watch
me
suffer
steve
some
things
you
know
already
one
that
you
are
a
carrier
there
have
been
no
other
carriers
we
like
to
know
what
makes
you
a
carrier
the
laboratory
again
i
thought
he
nodded
also
whether
your
final
contraction
of
mekstrom
disease
removes
the
i
said
hopefully
i
suppose
as
a
mekstrom
i
eventually
be
qualified
to
join
you
thorndyke
looked
blank
perhaps
he
said
flatly
to
my
mind
that
flat
was
the
same
sort
of
reply
that
mother
used
to
hand
me
when
i
wanted
something
that
she
did
not
want
to
give
i
been
eleven
before
i
got
walloped
across
the
bazoo
by
pointing
out
to
her
that
really
meant
because
nothing
that
she
said
it
to
ever
came
to
pass
look
thorndyke
let
take
off
our
shoes
and
stop
dancing
i
told
him
i
have
a
pretty
good
idea
of
what
been
going
on
i
like
an
honest
answer
to
what
likely
to
go
on
from
here
i
ca
give
you
that
who
can
he
said
nothing
but
he
began
to
look
at
me
as
though
i
were
quite
bright
that
made
two
of
us
i
was
looking
at
him
in
the
same
manner
my
finger
itched
a
bit
saving
the
situation
i
been
about
to
forget
that
thorndyke
was
a
mekstrom
and
take
a
swing
at
him
he
laughed
at
me
cynically
you
in
a
very
poor
position
to
dictate
terms
he
said
sharply
all
right
i
agreed
reluctantly
so
i
a
prisoner
i
also
under
a
sentence
of
death
do
think
me
unreasonable
if
i
object
to
it
the
trouble
with
your
thinking
is
that
you
expect
all
things
to
be
black
or
white
and
so
defined
you
ask
me
i
going
to
live
or
die
and
expect
me
to
answer
without
qualification
i
can
only
tell
you
that
i
do
know
which
that
it
all
depends
depends
upon
exactly
what
he
eyed
me
with
a
cold
stare
whether
you
worthy
of
living
who
to
decide
we
will
i
grunted
wishing
that
i
knew
more
latin
i
wanted
to
quote
that
latin
platitude
about
who
watches
the
watchers
he
watched
me
narrowly
and
i
expected
him
to
quote
me
the
phrase
after
having
read
my
mind
but
apparently
the
implication
of
the
phrase
did
not
appeal
to
him
and
so
he
remained
silent
i
broke
the
silence
by
saying
what
right
has
any
man
or
collection
of
men
to
decide
whether
i
or
anyone
else
has
the
right
to
live
or
die
it
done
all
the
time
he
replied
succinctly
yeah
criminals
are
i
not
a
criminal
i
violated
no
law
i
not
even
violated
very
many
of
the
ten
commandments
at
least
not
the
one
that
is
punishable
by
death
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
again
then
he
said
steve
you
the
victim
of
loose
propaganda
who
is
i
granted
the
entire
human
race
is
lambasted
by
one
form
of
propaganda
or
another
from
the
time
the
infant
learns
to
sit
up
until
the
elderly
lays
down
and
dies
we
all
guilty
of
loose
thinking
my
own
father
for
instance
had
to
quit
school
before
he
could
take
any
advanced
schooling
had
to
fight
his
way
up
had
to
collect
his
advanced
education
by
study
application
and
hard
practice
he
always
swore
that
this
long
period
of
hardship
strengthened
his
will
and
his
character
and
gave
him
the
guts
to
go
out
and
do
things
that
he
never
have
thought
of
if
he
had
an
easy
life
then
the
old
duck
turns
right
around
and
swears
that
he
never
see
any
son
of
his
take
the
bumps
as
he
took
them
that
beside
the
point
steve
i
know
what
sort
of
propaganda
been
listening
to
it
the
old
line
the
everything
for
anybody
line
the
no
man
must
die
alone
line
is
it
bad
thorndyke
shrugged
you
talked
about
loose
propaganda
he
said
well
in
this
welter
of
loose
propaganda
every
man
had
at
least
the
opportunity
of
choosing
which
line
of
guff
he
intends
to
adhere
to
even
willing
to
admit
that
there
is
both
right
and
wrong
on
both
sides
are
you
i
stifled
a
sour
grin
i
should
because
it
is
a
mistake
in
any
political
argument
to
even
let
on
that
the
other
guy
is
slightly
more
than
an
idiot
but
as
an
engineer
i
admit
it
now
that
a
help
he
said
more
cheerfully
you
objecting
of
course
to
the
fact
that
we
are
taking
the
right
to
pick
choose
and
select
those
people
that
we
think
are
more
likely
to
be
of
good
advantage
to
the
human
race
you
listened
to
that
old
line
about
the
hypothetical
cataclysm
that
threatens
the
human
race
and
how
would
you
choose
the
hundred
people
who
are
supposed
to
carry
on
well
have
you
ever
eyed
the
human
race
in
slightly
another
manner
i
would
know
i
told
him
maybe
have
you
ever
watched
the
proceedings
of
one
of
those
big
trials
where
some
conkpot
has
blown
the
brains
out
of
a
citizens
by
pointing
a
gun
and
emptying
it
at
a
crowd
if
you
have
you
been
appalled
by
the
sob
sisters
and
who
show
that
the
vicious
character
was
momentarily
off
his
toggle
we
must
execute
a
nut
no
matter
how
vicious
he
is
we
got
to
protect
him
feed
him
and
house
him
for
the
next
fifty
years
now
not
only
is
he
doing
society
absolutely
no
damned
good
while
he
locked
up
for
fifty
years
also
eating
up
his
share
of
the
standard
of
living
then
to
top
this
off
so
long
as
this
nut
is
alive
there
is
the
danger
that
some
fathead
will
succeed
in
getting
him
turned
loose
once
more
agreed
i
said
but
you
again
talking
about
criminals
which
i
do
think
applies
in
my
case
no
of
course
not
he
said
quickly
i
used
it
to
prove
to
you
that
this
is
one
way
of
looking
at
a
less
concrete
case
carry
this
soft
headed
thinking
a
couple
of
steps
higher
medical
science
has
made
it
possible
for
the
human
race
to
dilute
its
strength
epileptics
are
saved
to
breed
epileptics
haemophiliacs
are
preserved
neurotics
are
ironed
out
weaknesses
of
all
kinds
are
kept
alive
to
breed
their
strain
of
weakness
just
what
has
this
to
do
with
me
and
my
future
i
asked
quite
a
lot
i
trying
to
make
you
agree
that
there
are
quite
a
lot
of
undeserving
characters
here
on
earth
did
i
ever
deny
it
i
asked
him
pointedly
but
he
took
it
as
not
including
present
company
but
i
could
see
where
thorndyke
was
heading
first
eliminate
the
lice
on
the
body
politic
okay
so
i
am
blind
and
can
not
see
the
sense
of
incarcerating
a
murderer
that
has
to
be
fed
clothed
and
housed
at
my
expense
for
the
rest
of
his
natural
life
then
for
the
second
step
we
get
rid
of
weaklings
both
physical
and
mental
i
call
step
two
passably
okay
but
number
three
includes
grifters
beggars
bums
and
guys
out
for
the
soft
touch
and
here
i
begin
to
wonder
i
known
some
entertaining
grifters
beggars
and
bums
a
few
of
them
chose
their
way
of
life
for
their
own
just
as
i
became
a
mechanical
engineer
the
trouble
with
this
sort
of
philosophy
is
that
it
starts
off
with
an
appeal
to
justice
and
logic
i
quoting
myself
but
it
quickly
gets
dangerous
start
knocking
off
the
then
when
the
lowest
strata
of
society
is
gone
start
on
the
next
carry
this
line
of
reasoning
out
to
straight
aristotelian
logic
and
you
come
up
with
parties
like
you
and
me
who
may
have
been
quite
acceptable
when
compared
to
the
whole
of
humanity
but
who
now
have
no
one
but
his
betters
to
compete
with
i
had
never
reasoned
this
out
before
but
as
i
did
right
there
and
then
i
decided
that
society
can
not
draw
lines
nor
assume
a
static
pose
society
must
move
constantly
either
in
one
direction
or
the
other
and
while
i
object
to
paying
taxes
to
support
some
rattlehead
for
the
rest
of
his
natural
life
i
rather
have
it
that
way
than
to
have
someone
start
a
trend
of
bopping
off
everybody
who
has
not
the
ability
to
absorb
the
educational
level
of
the
scholar
because
if
the
trend
turned
upward
instead
of
downward
that
where
the
dividing
line
would
end
anarchy
at
one
end
is
as
bad
as
tyranny
at
the
other
i
sorry
you
can
not
come
to
a
reasonable
conclusion
said
thorndyke
if
you
can
not
see
the
logic
of
i
cut
him
off
short
look
doc
i
snapped
if
you
ca
see
where
your
line
of
thinking
ends
you
in
bad
shape
he
looked
superior
you
sour
because
you
know
you
have
got
what
it
takes
i
almost
nipped
you
so
damned
dumb
that
you
ca
see
that
in
any
society
of
supermen
you
not
be
qualified
to
clean
out
ash
trays
i
tossed
back
at
him
he
smiled
by
the
time
they
start
looking
at
my
level
if
they
ever
do
you
have
been
gone
long
ago
sorry
cornell
you
do
add
up
well
that
was
nothing
i
did
know
already
in
his
society
i
was
a
nonentity
yet
somehow
if
that
what
the
human
race
was
coming
to
under
the
thorndyke
and
the
phelps
i
did
care
to
stay
around
all
right
i
snapped
which
way
do
i
go
from
here
the
laboratory
or
will
you
dispense
with
the
preliminaries
and
let
me
take
the
high
slide
right
now
before
this
i
held
up
my
infected
finger
gets
to
the
painful
stages
with
the
air
and
tone
of
a
man
inspecting
an
interesting
specimen
impaled
on
a
mounting
pin
thorndyke
replied
oh
we
have
use
for
the
likes
of
you
xvii
it
would
please
me
no
end
to
report
here
that
the
gang
at
the
medical
center
were
crude
rough
vicious
and
that
they
did
give
a
damn
about
human
suffering
unfortunately
for
my
sense
of
moral
balance
i
ca
they
did
cut
huge
slices
out
of
my
hide
without
benefit
of
anaesthesia
they
did
shove
needles
into
me
or
strap
me
on
a
board
and
open
me
up
with
dull
knives
instead
they
treated
me
as
if
i
been
going
to
pay
for
my
treatment
and
ultimately
emerge
from
the
center
to
go
forth
and
extol
its
virtues
i
ate
good
food
slept
in
a
clean
and
comfortable
bed
smoked
free
cigarettes
read
the
best
magazines
and
also
some
of
the
worst
if
i
must
report
the
whole
truth
and
was
permitted
to
mingle
with
the
rest
of
the
patients
guests
victims
personnel
and
so
forth
that
were
attached
to
my
ward
i
was
not
at
any
time
treated
as
though
i
were
anything
but
a
willing
and
happy
member
of
their
team
it
was
known
that
i
was
not
but
if
any
emotion
was
shown
it
was
sympathy
at
my
plight
in
not
being
one
of
them
this
was
viewed
in
the
same
way
as
any
other
accident
of
birth
or
upbringing
in
my
room
was
another
man
about
my
age
he
arrived
a
day
before
me
with
an
early
infection
at
the
tip
of
his
middle
toe
he
was
if
got
to
produce
a
about
of
an
inch
ahead
of
me
he
had
no
worries
he
was
one
of
their
kind
of
thinkers
how
you
connect
i
asked
him
i
did
he
said
scratching
his
infected
toe
vigorously
they
connected
with
me
oh
yeah
i
was
sleeping
tight
and
not
even
dreaming
someone
rapped
on
my
apartment
door
and
i
growled
myself
out
of
bed
and
sort
of
felt
my
way
it
was
three
in
the
morning
guy
stood
there
looking
apologetic
a
message
for
you
he
tells
me
it
wait
until
morning
i
snarl
back
he
says
important
so
i
invite
him
in
he
waste
any
time
at
all
his
first
act
is
to
point
at
an
iron
floor
lamp
in
the
corner
and
ask
me
how
much
i
paid
for
it
i
tell
him
then
this
bird
drops
twice
the
amount
on
the
coffee
table
strides
over
to
the
corner
picks
up
the
lamp
and
ties
the
iron
pipe
into
a
bowknot
he
did
even
grunt
mullaney
he
asks
me
would
you
like
to
be
that
strong
i
did
have
to
think
it
over
i
told
him
right
then
and
there
then
we
spent
from
three
ayem
to
five
thirty
going
through
a
fast
question
and
answer
routine
sort
of
like
a
complicated
test
at
six
i
packed
and
i
on
my
way
here
with
my
case
of
mekstrom
disease
just
like
that
i
asked
mullaney
just
like
that
he
repeated
so
now
what
happens
oh
about
tomorrow
i
go
in
for
treatment
he
said
seems
as
how
they
got
to
start
treatment
before
the
infection
creeps
to
the
first
joint
or
i
lose
the
joint
he
contemplated
me
a
bit
he
was
a
perceptive
and
i
knew
it
you
got
another
day
or
more
because
your
ring
finger
is
longer
than
my
toe
what
the
treatment
like
i
asked
him
that
i
do
know
i
tried
to
dig
the
treatment
but
it
too
far
away
from
here
this
is
just
a
sort
of
preliminary
ward
i
gather
that
they
know
when
to
start
and
so
on
he
veiled
his
eyes
for
a
moment
he
was
undoubtedly
thinking
of
my
fate
chess
he
asked
changing
the
subject
abruptly
why
not
i
grinned
my
mind
was
in
it
he
beat
me
three
out
of
four
i
bedded
down
about
eleven
and
to
my
surprise
i
slept
well
they
must
have
been
shoving
something
into
me
to
make
me
sleep
i
know
me
very
well
and
i
sure
that
i
could
have
closed
an
eye
if
they
had
been
slipping
me
the
old
closeout
powder
for
three
nights
now
i
corked
off
solid
until
seven
ack
emma
and
i
come
alive
in
the
morning
fine
fit
and
fresh
but
on
the
following
morning
mullaney
was
missing
i
never
saw
him
again
at
noon
or
thereabouts
the
end
of
the
ring
finger
on
my
left
hand
was
as
solid
as
a
rock
i
could
squeeze
it
in
a
door
or
burn
it
with
a
cigarette
i
got
into
a
little
habit
of
scratching
kitchen
matches
on
it
as
i
tried
to
dig
into
the
solid
flesh
with
my
perception
i
growled
a
bit
at
my
fate
but
not
much
it
was
about
this
time
too
that
the
slight
itch
began
to
change
you
know
how
a
itch
is
it
can
sometimes
be
pleasant
like
the
itch
that
comes
after
a
fast
swim
in
the
salty
sea
and
a
in
the
bright
sun
when
the
drying
salt
water
makes
your
skin
itch
with
the
vibrant
pleasure
of
just
being
alive
this
is
not
like
the
bite
of
any
bug
but
the
kind
that
makes
you
want
to
take
another
dive
into
the
ocean
instead
of
trying
to
scratch
it
with
your
claws
well
the
itch
in
my
finger
had
been
one
of
the
pleasant
kinds
i
could
sort
of
scratch
it
away
by
taking
the
part
of
my
finger
in
my
other
hand
and
wiggle
briskly
but
now
the
itch
turned
into
a
deep
burning
pain
my
perception
never
good
enough
to
dig
the
finer
structure
clearly
was
good
enough
to
tell
me
that
my
crawling
horror
had
come
to
the
boundary
line
of
the
first
joint
it
was
this
pause
that
was
causing
the
burning
pain
according
to
what
i
been
told
if
someone
did
do
something
about
me
right
now
i
lose
the
end
joint
of
my
finger
nobody
came
to
ease
my
pain
nor
to
ease
my
mind
they
left
me
strictly
alone
i
spent
the
time
from
noon
until
three
examining
my
fingertip
as
i
not
examined
it
before
it
was
rock
hard
but
strangely
flexible
if
i
could
exert
enough
pressure
on
the
flesh
it
still
moved
with
the
flexing
of
my
hands
the
fingernail
itself
was
like
a
chip
of
chilled
steel
i
could
flex
the
nail
neither
with
my
other
hand
nor
by
biting
it
between
my
teeth
it
had
the
uncomfortable
solidity
of
a
sheet
of
metal
that
conveyed
to
my
brain
that
the
old
teeth
should
not
try
to
bite
too
hard
i
tried
prying
on
a
bit
of
metal
with
the
fingernail
inserting
the
nail
in
the
crack
where
a
metal
cylinder
had
been
formed
to
make
a
table
leg
i
might
have
been
able
to
pry
the
crack
wider
but
the
rest
of
my
body
did
not
have
the
power
nor
the
rigidity
necessary
to
drive
the
tiny
lever
that
was
my
fingertip
i
wondered
what
kind
of
they
used
for
a
manicure
at
the
door
to
my
room
opened
and
in
came
scholar
phelps
complete
with
his
benign
smile
and
his
hearty
air
well
he
boomed
we
meet
again
mr
cornell
under
trying
circumstances
i
said
unfortunately
so
he
nodded
however
we
ca
all
be
fortunate
i
dislike
being
a
vital
statistic
so
does
everybody
yet
from
a
philosophical
point
of
view
you
have
no
more
right
to
live
at
the
expense
of
someone
else
than
someone
else
has
a
right
to
live
at
your
expense
it
all
comes
out
even
in
the
final
accounting
and
of
course
if
every
man
were
granted
a
guaranteed
immortality
we
have
one
world
i
had
to
admit
that
he
was
right
but
i
still
could
not
accept
his
statistical
attitude
not
while
i
the
statistic
he
followed
my
thought
even
though
he
was
esper
it
was
hard
to
follow
anyway
all
right
i
admit
that
this
is
no
time
to
sit
around
discussing
philosophy
or
metaphysics
or
anything
of
that
nature
what
you
are
interested
in
is
you
how
absolutely
correct
you
know
of
course
that
you
are
a
carrier
so
i
come
to
believe
at
least
everybody
i
seem
to
have
any
contact
with
either
turns
up
missing
or
comes
down
with
mekstrom
or
both
scholar
phelps
nodded
you
might
have
gone
on
for
quite
some
time
if
it
had
been
so
obvious
i
eyed
him
just
what
went
on
i
asked
casually
did
you
have
a
squad
following
me
all
the
time
picking
up
the
debris
or
did
you
just
pick
up
the
ones
you
wanted
or
did
the
highways
make
you
indulge
in
a
running
competition
too
many
questions
at
once
most
of
which
answers
would
be
best
that
you
did
not
know
best
for
us
that
is
maybe
even
for
you
i
shrugged
we
seem
to
be
bordering
on
philosophy
again
when
the
important
point
is
what
you
intend
to
do
to
me
he
looked
unhappy
cornell
it
is
hard
to
remain
unphilosophical
in
a
case
like
this
so
many
avenues
of
thought
have
been
opened
so
many
ideas
and
angles
come
to
mind
we
readily
admit
what
you
probably
concluded
that
you
as
a
carrier
have
become
the
one
basic
factor
that
we
have
been
seeking
for
some
twenty
years
and
more
you
are
the
dirigible
force
the
last
brick
in
the
building
the
final
answer
or
and
i
hate
to
say
it
were
were
for
all
of
our
knowledge
of
mekstrom
we
know
so
very
little
he
said
in
certain
maladies
the
carrier
is
himself
immune
in
some
we
observe
that
the
carrier
results
from
a
incomplete
infection
with
the
disease
which
immunizes
him
but
does
not
kill
the
bugs
in
others
we
seen
the
carrier
become
normal
after
he
has
finally
contracted
the
disease
what
we
must
know
now
is
is
steve
cornell
the
mekstrom
carrier
now
a
because
he
has
contracted
the
disease
how
are
you
going
to
find
out
i
asked
him
that
a
problem
he
said
thoughtfully
one
school
feels
that
we
should
not
treat
you
since
the
treatment
itself
may
destroy
whatever
unknown
factor
makes
you
a
carrier
the
other
claims
that
if
we
treat
you
you
hardly
live
long
enough
to
permit
comprehensive
research
anyway
a
third
school
believes
that
there
is
time
to
find
out
whether
you
are
still
a
carrier
make
some
tests
and
then
treat
you
after
which
these
tests
are
to
be
repeated
rather
bitterly
i
said
i
suppose
i
have
absolutely
no
vote
hardly
his
face
was
pragmatic
and
to
which
school
do
you
belong
i
asked
sourly
do
you
want
me
to
get
the
cure
or
am
i
to
die
miserably
while
you
take
tabs
on
my
blood
pressure
or
do
i
merely
lose
an
arm
while
you
sitting
with
folded
hands
waiting
for
the
laboratory
report
in
any
case
we
learn
a
lot
about
mekstrom
from
you
he
said
even
if
you
die
as
caustically
as
i
could
i
said
it
nice
to
know
that
i
am
not
going
to
die
in
vain
he
eyed
me
with
contempt
you
not
afraid
to
die
are
you
mr
cornell
that
a
dirty
question
to
ask
any
man
sure
i
afraid
to
die
i
just
do
like
the
idea
of
being
as
bad
as
life
is
it
better
than
nothing
but
the
way
he
put
the
question
he
was
implying
that
i
should
be
happy
to
die
for
the
benefit
of
humanity
in
general
and
that
a
question
that
is
unfairly
loaded
after
all
everybody
is
slated
to
kick
off
there
is
no
other
way
of
resigning
from
the
universe
so
if
i
have
to
die
it
might
as
well
be
for
the
benefit
of
something
and
if
it
happens
to
be
humanity
so
much
the
better
but
when
the
case
is
proffered
on
a
silver
tray
i
feel
somebody
else
not
me
the
next
argument
phelps
would
be
tossing
out
would
be
the
one
that
goes
two
thousand
years
ago
a
man
died
for
humanity
which
always
makes
me
sick
no
matter
how
you
look
at
us
there
is
no
resemblance
between
him
and
me
i
cut
him
short
before
he
could
say
it
whether
or
not
i
afraid
to
die
and
for
good
or
evil
now
or
later
is
beside
the
point
i
have
obviously
nothing
to
say
about
the
time
place
and
the
reasons
we
sat
there
and
glared
at
one
another
he
did
know
whether
to
laugh
or
snarl
and
i
did
care
which
he
did
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
was
leading
up
to
something
that
looked
like
the
end
then
i
get
the
standard
funeral
and
statements
would
be
given
out
that
i
died
because
medical
research
had
not
been
able
to
save
me
and
blah
blah
blah
complete
with
lack
of
funds
and
the
medical
center
charity
drive
the
result
would
mean
more
moola
for
phelps
and
higher
efficiency
for
his
operations
and
to
the
devil
with
the
rest
of
the
world
let
get
along
with
it
i
snapped
i
no
opinion
no
vote
no
right
of
appeal
why
bother
to
ask
me
how
i
feel
calmly
he
replied
because
i
am
not
a
unhuman
monster
cornell
i
would
prefer
that
you
see
my
point
of
view
or
at
least
enough
of
it
to
admit
that
there
is
a
bit
of
right
on
my
side
seems
to
me
i
went
through
that
with
thorndyke
this
is
another
angle
i
speaking
of
my
right
of
discovery
you
speaking
of
what
my
right
of
discovery
you
as
an
engineer
should
be
familiar
with
the
idea
if
i
were
a
poet
i
could
write
an
ode
to
my
love
and
no
one
would
forbid
me
my
right
to
give
it
to
her
and
to
nobody
else
if
i
were
a
cook
with
a
special
recipe
no
one
could
demand
that
i
hand
it
over
unless
i
had
a
special
friend
he
who
discovers
something
new
should
be
granted
the
right
to
control
it
if
this
mekstrom
business
were
some
sort
of
physical
patent
or
some
new
process
i
could
apply
for
a
patent
and
have
it
for
my
exclusive
use
for
a
period
of
seventeen
years
am
i
not
right
yes
but
except
that
my
patent
would
be
infringed
upon
and
i
have
no
control
i
stood
up
suddenly
and
faced
him
angrily
he
did
not
cower
after
all
he
was
a
mekstrom
but
he
did
shut
up
for
a
moment
seems
to
me
i
snarled
that
any
process
that
can
be
used
to
save
human
life
should
not
be
held
secret
patentable
or
under
the
control
of
any
one
man
or
group
this
is
an
argument
that
always
comes
up
you
may
of
course
be
correct
but
happily
for
me
cornell
i
have
the
process
and
you
have
not
and
it
is
my
own
conviction
that
i
have
the
right
to
use
it
on
those
people
who
seem
in
my
opinion
to
hold
the
most
for
the
future
advancement
of
the
human
race
however
i
do
not
care
to
go
over
this
argument
again
it
is
tiresome
and
it
never
ends
as
one
of
the
ancient
greek
philosophers
observed
you
can
not
change
a
man
mind
by
arguing
with
him
the
other
fact
remains
however
that
you
do
have
something
to
offer
us
despite
your
contrary
mental
processes
do
go
on
what
do
i
have
to
do
to
gain
this
benefit
who
do
i
have
to
kill
i
eyed
him
cynically
and
then
added
or
is
it
shall
i
kill
i
like
these
things
to
be
proper
you
know
do
be
sarcastic
i
serious
he
told
me
then
stop
pussyfooting
and
come
to
the
point
i
snapped
you
know
what
the
story
is
i
do
so
if
you
think
i
be
interested
why
not
tell
me
instead
of
letting
me
find
out
the
hard
way
you
of
course
were
a
carrier
maybe
you
still
are
we
can
find
out
in
fact
we
have
to
find
out
before
we
for
god
sake
stop
it
i
yelled
you
meandering
sorry
he
said
in
a
tone
of
apology
that
surprised
me
all
the
way
down
to
my
feet
he
shook
himself
visibly
and
went
on
from
there
you
if
still
a
carrier
can
be
of
use
to
the
medical
center
now
do
you
understand
sure
i
understand
but
good
as
a
normal
human
type
they
held
nothing
over
me
and
just
shoved
me
here
and
there
and
picked
up
the
victims
after
me
but
now
that
i
was
a
victim
myself
they
could
offer
me
their
cure
only
if
i
would
swear
to
go
around
the
country
deliberately
infecting
the
people
they
wanted
among
them
it
was
that
or
lie
there
and
die
miserably
this
had
not
come
to
scholar
phelps
as
a
sudden
flash
of
genius
he
been
planning
this
all
along
had
been
waiting
to
pop
this
delicate
question
after
i
been
pushed
around
had
a
chance
to
torture
myself
mentally
and
was
undoubtedly
soft
for
anything
that
looked
like
salvation
there
is
one
awkward
point
said
scholar
phelps
suavely
once
we
have
cured
you
we
would
have
no
hold
on
you
other
than
your
loyalty
and
your
personal
honor
to
fulfill
a
promise
given
neither
of
us
are
naive
cornell
we
both
know
that
any
honorable
promise
is
only
as
valid
as
the
basic
honor
involved
since
your
personal
opinion
is
that
this
medical
treatment
should
be
used
indiscriminately
and
that
our
program
to
better
the
human
race
by
competitive
selection
is
foreign
to
your
feelings
you
would
feel
to
betray
us
am
i
not
correct
what
could
i
say
to
that
first
i
out
then
i
in
now
i
out
again
what
was
phelps
getting
at
if
our
positions
were
reversed
cornell
i
sure
that
you
seek
some
additional
binding
force
against
me
i
shall
continue
to
seek
some
such
lever
against
you
for
the
same
reason
in
the
meantime
cornell
we
shall
make
a
test
to
see
whether
we
have
any
real
basis
for
any
agreement
at
all
you
may
have
ceased
to
be
a
carrier
you
know
yeah
i
admitted
darkly
in
the
meantime
he
said
cheerfully
the
least
we
can
do
is
to
treat
your
finger
i
hate
to
have
you
hedge
a
deal
because
we
did
not
deliver
your
cured
body
in
the
whole
he
put
his
head
out
of
the
door
and
summoned
a
nurse
who
came
with
a
black
bag
from
the
bag
scholar
phelps
took
a
hypo
and
a
small
metal
box
the
top
of
which
held
a
small
slender
jointed
platform
and
some
tiny
straps
he
strapped
my
finger
to
this
platform
and
then
plugged
in
a
length
of
line
cord
to
the
nearest
wall
socket
the
little
platforms
moved
the
one
nearest
my
wrist
vibrated
rapidly
across
a
very
small
excursion
that
tickled
like
the
devil
the
end
platform
moved
in
an
arc
flexing
the
finger
tip
from
straight
to
about
seventy
degrees
this
moved
fairly
slow
but
regularly
up
and
down
i
not
fool
you
he
said
drily
this
is
going
to
hurt
he
set
the
hypo
on
top
of
the
joint
and
let
it
go
for
a
moment
the
finger
felt
cold
numb
pleasant
then
the
shock
wore
away
and
the
tip
of
my
finger
my
whole
finger
and
part
of
my
hand
shocked
me
with
the
most
excruciating
agony
that
the
hide
of
man
ever
felt
flashes
and
waves
of
pain
darted
up
my
arm
to
the
elbow
and
the
muscles
in
my
forearm
jumped
the
sensitive
nerve
in
my
elbow
sang
and
sent
darting
waves
of
zigzag
needles
up
to
my
shoulder
my
hand
was
a
source
of
searing
heat
and
freezing
cold
and
the
pain
of
being
crushed
and
twisted
and
wrenched
out
of
joint
all
at
the
same
time
phelps
wiped
my
wet
face
with
a
towel
loaded
another
hypo
and
let
me
have
it
in
the
shoulder
gradually
the
stuff
took
hold
and
the
awful
pain
began
to
subside
not
all
the
way
it
just
diminished
from
absolutely
unbearable
to
merely
terrible
i
knew
at
that
moment
why
a
trapped
animal
will
bite
off
its
own
foreleg
to
get
free
of
the
trap
from
the
depths
of
his
bag
he
found
a
bottle
and
poured
a
for
me
it
went
down
like
a
soft
drink
it
had
about
as
much
kick
as
when
you
pour
a
drink
of
water
into
a
highball
glass
that
still
holds
a
dreg
of
melted
ice
and
diluted
liquor
but
it
burned
like
fury
once
it
hit
my
stomach
and
my
mind
began
to
wobble
he
given
me
a
slug
of
the
pure
quill
one
hundred
proof
as
some
sort
of
it
worked
very
gradually
the
awful
pain
in
my
hand
began
to
subside
you
can
take
that
manipulator
off
in
an
hour
or
so
he
told
me
and
in
the
meantime
we
get
along
with
our
testing
i
gathered
that
they
could
stop
this
treatment
anywhere
along
the
process
if
i
did
not
measure
up
xviii
midnight
the
manipulator
had
been
off
my
hand
for
several
hours
and
it
was
obvious
that
my
mekstrom
was
past
the
first
joint
and
creeping
up
towards
the
next
i
eyed
it
with
some
distaste
as
much
as
i
wanted
to
have
a
fine
hard
body
i
was
not
too
pleased
at
having
agony
for
a
companion
every
time
the
infection
crossed
a
joint
i
began
to
wonder
about
the
wrist
this
is
a
nice
complicated
joint
and
should
if
possible
exceed
the
pain
of
the
first
joint
in
the
ring
finger
heard
tell
of
course
that
once
you
reached
the
top
additional
torture
does
not
hurt
any
greater
i
accepted
this
statement
as
it
was
printed
but
now
i
was
not
too
sure
that
what
i
just
been
through
was
not
one
of
those
exceptions
that
take
place
every
now
and
then
to
the
best
of
rules
i
was
still
in
a
dark
and
disconsolate
mood
but
i
managed
to
eat
and
i
shaved
and
showered
and
i
hit
the
hay
because
it
was
as
good
a
place
to
be
as
anywhere
else
i
could
lie
there
and
dig
the
premises
with
my
esper
there
were
very
few
patients
in
this
building
and
none
were
done
up
like
the
character
in
the
macklin
place
they
moved
the
patients
to
some
other
part
of
the
grounds
when
the
cure
started
there
were
very
many
nurses
doctors
scholars
or
other
personnel
around
either
outside
along
one
side
of
a
road
was
a
small
lighted
house
that
was
obviously
a
sort
of
guard
but
it
was
casual
instead
of
being
formal
and
military
in
appearance
the
ground
instead
of
being
patrolled
by
human
guards
which
might
have
caused
some
comment
was
carefully
laid
off
into
checkerboard
squares
by
a
complicated
system
of
photobeams
and
induction
bridges
you
probably
read
about
how
the
job
of
casing
a
joint
should
be
done
i
did
it
the
same
way
i
dug
back
and
forth
collecting
the
layout
from
the
back
door
of
my
building
towards
the
nearest
puff
of
dead
area
this
coign
of
safety
billowed
outward
from
the
pattern
towards
the
building
like
an
arm
of
cumulus
cloud
and
the
top
of
it
rose
like
a
column
to
a
height
above
my
range
it
sort
of
leaned
forward
but
it
did
not
lean
far
enough
to
be
directly
above
the
building
the
far
side
of
the
column
was
just
like
the
rear
side
even
though
i
well
trained
it
always
startles
me
when
i
perceive
the
far
side
of
a
smallish
dead
area
inclined
like
everybody
else
to
consider
perception
on
a
basis
instead
of
on
a
sort
of
grasp
i
let
my
thinker
run
free
if
i
could
direct
a
breakout
from
this
joint
with
a
lot
of
outside
help
i
have
a
hot
jetcopter
pilot
come
down
the
column
with
a
dead
engine
the
medical
center
did
not
have
any
radar
probably
on
the
proposition
that
too
high
a
degree
of
security
indicated
a
high
degree
of
material
to
hide
so
i
come
down
dead
engine
land
and
wait
it
out
timing
would
have
to
be
perfect
because
i
the
prisoner
would
have
to
make
a
fast
gallop
across
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
of
wide
open
psi
area
scale
a
tall
fence
topped
with
barbed
wire
cross
another
fifty
yards
into
the
murk
and
then
find
my
rescuer
the
take
off
would
be
fast
once
i
located
the
in
the
murk
and
everything
would
depend
upon
a
hot
pilot
who
felt
confident
enough
in
his
engine
and
his
rotorjets
to
let
go
with
a
roar
and
a
lift
without
warmup
during
which
time
unfortunately
for
all
plans
the
people
at
the
medical
center
would
have
been
reading
my
mind
and
would
probably
have
that
dead
patch
well
patrolled
with
big
rough
gentlemen
armed
with
stuff
heavy
enough
to
stop
a
tank
lacking
any
sort
of
device
or
doodad
that
would
conceal
my
mind
from
prying
telepaths
about
the
only
thing
i
could
do
was
to
lay
here
in
my
soft
bed
and
daydream
of
making
my
escape
eventually
i
went
to
sleep
and
dreamed
that
i
was
hunting
mallards
with
a
baited
with
a
stale
doughnut
the
only
thing
that
bothered
me
was
a
couple
of
guys
who
thought
that
the
way
to
hunt
mallards
was
with
shotguns
and
their
dress
was
just
as
out
of
taste
as
their
equipment
who
ever
hunted
ducks
from
a
canoe
dressed
in
windbreakers
and
hightopped
boots
eventually
they
bought
some
ducks
from
me
and
went
home
leaving
me
to
my
slumbers
about
eight
in
the
morning
there
was
a
tentative
tap
on
my
door
while
i
was
growling
about
why
they
should
bother
tapping
the
door
opened
and
a
woman
came
in
with
my
breakfast
tray
she
was
not
my
nurse
she
was
the
enamelled
blonde
receptionist
she
had
lost
some
of
her
enamelled
sophistication
it
was
not
evident
in
her
her
dress
or
her
these
were
perfection
in
fact
she
bore
that
look
that
made
me
think
of
an
automaton
triggered
to
make
the
right
noises
and
to
present
the
proper
expression
at
the
correct
time
as
though
she
had
never
had
a
thought
of
her
own
or
an
emotion
that
was
above
the
level
of
very
mild
interest
as
if
the
perfection
of
her
dress
and
the
characterless
beauty
of
her
face
were
more
important
than
anything
else
in
her
life
but
the
loss
of
absolute
impersonality
was
gone
and
it
took
me
some
several
moments
to
dig
it
out
of
her
appearance
then
i
saw
it
her
eyes
they
no
longer
looked
glassily
out
of
that
clear
oval
face
at
a
point
about
three
inches
above
my
left
shoulder
but
they
were
centered
on
me
from
no
matter
what
point
in
the
room
she
be
as
she
went
about
the
business
of
running
open
the
blinds
checking
the
this
and
that
and
the
other
like
any
nurses
helper
finally
she
placed
my
tray
on
the
and
stood
looking
down
at
me
from
my
first
meeting
with
her
i
knew
she
was
no
telepath
so
i
bluntly
said
where
the
regular
girl
where
my
nurse
i
taking
over
for
the
time
she
told
me
her
voice
was
strained
she
been
trying
to
use
that
cultured
tone
she
used
as
the
professional
receptionist
but
the
voice
had
cracked
through
the
training
enough
to
let
some
of
her
natural
tone
come
through
why
then
she
relaxed
completely
or
maybe
it
was
a
matter
of
coming
unglued
her
face
allowed
itself
to
take
on
some
character
and
her
body
ceased
being
that
rigid
type
what
your
trouble
i
asked
her
softly
she
had
something
on
her
mind
that
was
a
bit
too
big
for
her
but
her
training
was
not
broad
enough
to
allow
her
to
get
it
out
i
hoped
to
help
if
i
could
i
also
wanted
to
know
what
she
was
doing
here
if
scholar
phelps
was
thinking
about
putting
a
lever
on
me
of
the
female
type
he
guessed
wrong
she
was
looking
at
me
and
i
could
see
a
fragment
of
fright
in
her
face
is
it
terrible
she
asked
me
in
a
whisper
is
what
terrible
me
me
mekstrom
d
disease
the
last
word
came
out
with
a
couple
of
big
tears
oozing
from
closed
lids
why
i
asked
do
i
look
all
shot
to
bits
she
opened
the
eyes
and
looked
at
me
does
it
hurt
i
remembered
the
agony
of
my
finger
and
tried
to
lie
a
little
i
told
her
but
i
told
that
it
was
because
i
waited
too
long
for
my
first
treatment
i
hoped
that
i
was
correct
maybe
it
was
wishful
thinking
but
i
claim
that
right
i
did
want
to
go
through
the
same
agony
every
time
we
crossed
a
joint
i
reached
over
to
the
bedside
table
and
found
my
cigarettes
i
slipped
two
up
and
offered
one
of
them
to
her
she
put
a
tentative
hand
forward
slowly
a
reluctance
in
her
motion
this
changed
as
her
hand
came
forward
it
was
the
same
sort
of
reluctance
that
you
feel
when
you
start
out
to
visit
the
dentist
for
a
roaring
tooth
the
closer
you
get
to
the
dentist
office
the
less
inclined
you
are
to
finish
the
job
then
at
some
indeterminate
point
you
cross
the
place
of
no
return
and
from
that
moment
you
go
forward
with
increased
determination
she
finally
made
the
cigarette
package
but
she
was
very
careful
not
to
touch
my
hand
as
she
took
out
the
weed
then
as
if
she
reached
that
point
of
no
return
her
hand
slipped
around
the
package
and
caught
me
by
the
wrist
we
were
for
three
heartbeats
then
i
lifted
my
other
hand
took
out
the
cigarette
she
missed
and
held
it
forward
for
her
she
took
it
i
dropped
the
pack
and
let
my
hand
slip
back
until
we
were
holding
hands
practically
she
shuddered
i
flipped
my
lighter
and
let
her
inhale
a
big
puff
before
i
put
the
next
question
why
are
you
here
and
what
goes
on
in
a
flat
dry
voice
she
said
i
supposed
to
and
let
it
trail
away
without
finishing
it
guinea
pig
i
blurted
bluntly
she
collapsed
like
a
deflated
balloon
next
she
had
her
face
buried
in
my
shoulder
bawling
like
a
hurt
baby
i
stroked
her
shoulder
gently
but
she
shuddered
away
from
my
hand
as
though
it
were
poison
i
shoved
her
upright
and
shook
her
a
bit
do
blubber
like
an
idiot
sit
there
and
talk
like
a
human
being
it
took
her
a
minute
of
visible
effort
before
she
said
you
supposed
to
be
a
carrier
i
supposed
to
find
out
whether
you
are
a
carrier
well
i
suspected
something
of
that
sort
shakily
she
asked
me
how
do
i
get
it
mr
cornell
i
eyed
her
sympathetically
then
i
held
up
my
left
hand
and
looked
at
the
infection
this
was
the
finger
that
had
been
gummed
to
bits
by
the
mekstrom
infant
back
in
homestead
with
a
shrug
of
uncertainty
i
lifted
her
hand
to
my
mouth
i
felt
with
my
tongue
and
dug
with
my
perception
until
i
had
a
tiny
fold
of
her
skin
between
my
front
teeth
then
sharply
i
bit
down
drawing
blood
she
jerked
stiffened
closed
her
eyes
and
took
a
deep
breath
but
she
did
not
cry
out
that
if
anything
should
do
it
i
said
flatly
now
go
out
and
get
some
iodine
for
the
cut
is
likely
to
become
infected
with
something
bad
and
i
do
think
antiseptic
will
hurt
the
mekstrom
infection
if
it
taken
place
they
given
me
the
antiseptic
works
in
homestead
i
recalled
now
miss
nameless
you
sit
over
there
and
tell
me
how
come
this
distressing
tableau
oh
i
ca
she
cried
then
she
left
in
a
hurry
sucking
on
her
bleeding
finger
i
did
need
any
explanation
i
just
wanted
my
suspicions
confirmed
someone
had
a
lever
on
her
maybe
someone
she
loved
was
a
mekstrom
and
her
loyalty
was
extracted
because
of
it
the
chances
were
also
high
that
she
been
given
to
understand
that
they
accept
her
as
a
member
if
she
ever
caught
mekstrom
and
they
taken
my
arrival
as
a
fine
chance
to
check
me
and
get
her
at
the
same
time
i
wondered
about
her
she
was
no
i
could
quite
see
the
stratified
society
outlined
by
scholar
phelps
as
holding
a
position
open
for
her
in
the
top
echelon
except
she
was
a
woman
attractive
if
you
like
your
women
beautiful
and
and
she
probably
would
be
happy
to
live
in
a
little
world
bounded
on
all
sides
with
women
magazines
lace
curtains
tv
soap
opera
and
a
corral
full
of
little
mekstrom
kids
i
grinned
funny
how
the
proponents
of
the
stratified
society
always
have
their
comeuppance
by
the
need
of
women
whose
minds
are
bent
on
mundane
things
like
homes
and
families
well
i
hoped
she
caught
it
if
that
what
she
wanted
i
was
willing
to
bet
my
life
that
she
cared
a
lot
more
for
being
with
her
man
than
she
did
for
the
cockeyed
society
he
was
supporting
i
finished
my
breakfast
and
went
out
to
watch
a
couple
of
telepaths
playing
chess
until
lunch
time
and
then
gave
up
telepathic
chess
was
too
much
like
playing
perceptive
poker
then
after
lunch
came
the
afternoon
full
of
laboratory
tests
inspections
experiments
and
so
forth
they
did
do
much
that
been
tried
at
homestead
and
i
surprised
them
again
by
being
able
to
help
in
their
blood
counts
and
stuff
of
that
sort
they
did
not
provide
me
with
a
new
room
mate
so
i
wandered
around
after
dinner
hoping
that
i
could
avoid
both
thorndyke
and
phelps
i
want
to
get
into
another
fool
argument
with
them
and
the
affair
of
the
little
scared
receptionist
was
more
than
likely
to
make
me
say
a
few
words
that
might
well
get
me
cast
into
the
outer
darkness
for
their
mere
semantic
content
once
more
i
hit
the
sack
early
and
once
more
there
came
a
tap
on
my
door
about
eight
it
was
not
a
tentative
little
frightened
tap
this
time
it
was
more
jovial
and
eager
sounding
my
reaction
was
about
the
same
since
it
was
their
show
and
their
property
i
could
see
any
reason
why
they
made
this
odd
to
politeness
it
was
the
receptionist
again
she
came
in
with
a
big
wistful
smile
and
dropped
my
tray
on
the
bed
table
look
she
cried
she
held
up
her
hand
the
bleeding
had
stopped
and
there
was
a
thin
film
over
the
cut
i
dug
at
it
and
nodded
it
was
the
first
show
of
mekstrom
flesh
without
a
doubt
that
it
kid
i
know
she
said
happily
golly
i
could
kiss
you
then
before
i
could
think
of
all
the
various
ways
in
which
the
word
golly
sounded
out
of
character
for
her
she
launched
herself
into
my
arms
and
was
busily
erasing
every
attempt
at
logical
thought
with
one
of
the
warmest
smoocheroo
that
i
enjoyed
for
what
seemed
like
years
since
i
held
catherine
in
my
arms
in
her
apartment
just
before
we
eloped
i
spent
my
time
in
the
company
of
nurse
farrow
who
held
no
emotional
appeal
to
me
and
the
rest
of
my
female
company
had
been
mekstroms
whose
handholding
might
twist
off
a
wrist
if
they
got
a
thrill
out
of
it
about
the
time
i
began
to
respond
with
enthusiasm
and
vigor
she
extricated
herself
from
my
clutch
and
slid
back
to
the
foot
of
the
bed
out
of
reach
a
little
breathlessly
she
said
harry
will
thank
you
for
this
meant
the
infection
in
her
finger
then
she
was
gone
and
i
was
thinking
should
drop
then
i
grinned
at
myself
like
the
cheshire
cat
because
i
realized
that
i
was
so
valuable
a
property
that
they
could
afford
to
let
me
die
no
matter
what
i
be
kept
alive
and
after
having
things
go
so
sour
for
so
long
a
time
things
were
about
to
take
a
fast
turn
and
go
my
way
i
discounted
the
affair
even
if
the
baby
were
another
carrier
it
would
take
a
long
time
before
the
kid
was
old
enough
to
be
trusted
in
his
aim
i
discounted
it
even
more
because
i
had
been
roaring
around
the
countryside
biting
innocent
citizens
mere
contact
was
enough
if
the
bite
did
anything
it
may
have
hastened
the
process
so
here
i
was
a
nice
valuable
property
with
a
will
of
my
own
i
could
either
throw
in
with
phelps
and
bite
only
phelps
chosen
aristocrats
or
i
could
go
back
to
the
highways
and
bite
everybody
in
sight
i
laughed
at
my
image
in
the
mirror
i
am
a
democratic
sort
of
soul
but
when
it
comes
to
biting
there
some
i
rather
bite
than
others
i
bared
my
teeth
at
my
image
but
it
was
more
of
a
leering
smile
of
the
ad
than
a
fierce
snarl
my
image
looked
pensive
it
was
thinking
old
carnivore
ere
you
go
biting
anybody
you
first
got
to
bite
your
way
out
of
the
medical
xix
one
hour
later
they
pulled
my
fangs
without
benefit
of
anaesthesia
thorndyke
came
in
to
inspect
the
progress
of
my
infection
and
allowed
as
how
i
be
about
ready
for
the
full
treatment
in
a
few
days
we
like
to
delay
the
full
treatment
as
long
as
possible
he
told
me
because
it
immobilizes
the
patient
too
long
as
it
is
he
pressed
a
call
bell
waited
and
soon
the
door
opened
to
admit
a
nurses
helper
pushing
a
trundle
cart
loaded
with
medical
junk
i
still
do
know
what
was
on
the
cart
because
i
was
too
flabbergasted
to
notice
it
i
was
paying
all
my
attention
to
catherine
cheerful
in
her
gray
lady
uniform
being
utterly
helpful
bright
gay
and
relaxed
i
was
tongue
tied
geflummoxed
beaten
down
and
well
just
speechless
catherine
was
quite
professional
about
her
help
she
loaded
the
hypo
and
slapped
it
into
thorndyke
open
hand
her
eyes
looked
into
mine
and
they
smiled
reassuringly
her
hand
was
firm
as
she
took
my
arm
she
locked
her
strength
on
my
hand
and
held
it
immobile
while
thorndyke
shot
me
in
the
second
joint
there
was
a
personal
touch
to
her
only
briefly
when
she
breathed
steve
i
so
glad
and
then
went
on
about
her
work
the
irony
of
it
escaped
me
but
later
i
did
recall
the
oddity
of
congratulating
someone
who
just
contracted
a
disease
then
that
wave
of
agony
hit
me
and
the
only
thing
i
can
remember
through
it
was
catherine
folding
a
towel
so
that
the
hem
would
be
on
the
inside
when
she
wiped
the
beads
of
sweat
from
my
face
she
cradled
my
head
between
her
hands
and
crooned
lightly
to
me
until
the
depths
of
the
pain
was
past
then
she
got
efficient
again
and
waved
thorndyke
aside
to
see
to
the
little
straps
on
the
manipulator
herself
she
adjusted
them
delicately
then
she
poured
me
a
glass
of
ice
water
and
put
it
where
i
could
reach
it
with
my
other
hand
she
left
after
one
long
searching
look
into
my
eyes
and
i
knew
that
she
would
be
back
later
to
talk
to
me
alone
this
seemed
all
right
with
thorndyke
the
wily
telepath
who
would
be
able
to
dig
a
reconstruction
of
our
private
talk
with
a
little
urging
on
his
part
after
catherine
was
gone
thorndyke
smiled
down
at
me
with
cynical
there
your
lever
steve
he
said
the
dope
helped
to
kill
all
but
the
worst
waves
of
searing
pain
between
them
i
managed
to
grind
out
how
did
you
sell
her
that
bill
of
goods
thorndyke
his
reply
was
scornful
maybe
she
likes
your
hide
all
in
one
piece
he
grunted
he
left
me
with
my
mind
with
thoughts
and
pain
the
little
manipulator
was
working
my
second
finger
joint
up
and
down
rhythmically
and
with
each
move
came
pain
it
also
exercised
the
old
joint
which
had
grown
so
rigid
that
my
muscles
had
been
able
to
move
it
for
several
hours
that
added
agony
too
the
dope
helped
but
it
also
dimmed
my
ability
to
concentrate
up
to
a
certain
point
everything
was
quite
logical
and
easy
to
understand
catherine
was
here
because
they
had
contacted
her
through
some
channel
and
said
throw
in
with
us
and
we
see
that
your
lover
does
not
die
miserably
so
much
was
reasonable
but
after
that
point
the
whole
thing
began
to
take
on
a
mad
quality
given
normal
circumstances
catherine
would
have
come
to
me
as
swiftly
as
i
have
gone
to
her
if
i
known
how
not
only
that
but
i
probably
have
sworn
eternal
fealty
to
them
for
their
service
even
though
i
could
not
stand
their
way
of
thinking
but
catherine
was
smart
enough
to
realize
that
i
as
the
only
known
carrier
of
mekstrom
disease
was
more
valuable
live
than
dead
why
then
had
catherine
come
here
to
place
herself
in
their
hands
alone
she
might
have
gone
off
in
an
emotional
tizzy
but
the
highways
had
good
advisers
who
should
have
pointed
out
that
steve
cornell
was
one
man
alive
who
could
walk
with
impunity
among
friend
or
foe
why
they
had
even
tried
to
collect
me
until
it
became
evident
that
i
was
in
line
for
the
old
treatment
then
they
had
to
take
me
in
because
the
medical
center
wanted
any
information
they
could
get
above
and
beyond
the
fact
that
i
was
a
carrier
if
someone
from
homestead
had
been
in
that
courtroom
i
now
be
among
friends
then
the
ugly
thought
hit
me
and
my
mind
could
face
it
for
some
time
catherine
cheerful
willingness
to
help
them
must
be
reorientation
and
nothing
else
now
although
i
mentioned
reorientation
before
what
i
actually
know
about
it
is
meager
it
makes
jekylls
out
of
former
hydes
and
the
transformation
is
complete
it
can
be
done
swiftly
the
rapidity
depends
upon
the
strength
of
the
mind
of
the
operator
compared
to
the
mind
of
the
subject
it
is
slightly
harder
to
reorient
a
defiant
mind
than
a
willing
one
it
sticks
unless
someone
else
begins
to
tinker
again
it
is
easier
to
make
a
good
man
out
of
a
bad
one
than
the
reverse
although
the
latter
is
eminently
possible
this
is
too
difficult
a
problem
to
discuss
to
the
satisfaction
of
everybody
but
it
seems
to
go
along
with
the
old
theory
that
good
does
benefit
the
tribe
of
mankind
in
the
long
run
while
bad
things
cause
trouble
i
say
no
more
than
to
point
out
that
no
culture
based
upon
theft
murder
piracy
and
pillage
has
ever
survived
the
thought
of
catherine
mind
being
tampered
with
made
me
seethe
with
anger
i
forgot
my
pain
and
began
to
probe
around
wildly
and
as
i
probed
i
began
to
know
the
real
feeling
of
helpless
futility
for
here
i
was
practically
immobilized
and
certainly
dependent
upon
them
for
help
this
was
no
time
to
attempt
a
rescue
of
my
sweetheart
who
would
only
be
taken
away
kicking
and
screaming
all
the
way
from
here
to
the
first
place
where
i
could
find
a
haven
and
have
her
the
latter
would
not
be
hard
among
the
other
things
i
knew
about
reorientation
was
that
it
could
be
negated
by
some
strong
emotional
ties
and
a
personal
background
that
included
worthy
objection
to
the
new
personality
for
my
perceptive
digging
i
came
up
with
nothing
but
those
things
that
any
hospital
held
patients
nurses
interns
orderlies
a
couple
of
doctors
a
scholar
presiding
over
a
sheaf
of
files
and
finally
catherine
puttering
over
an
autoclave
she
was
setting
out
a
string
of
instruments
under
the
tutelage
of
a
superintendent
of
nurses
who
was
explaining
how
the
job
should
be
done
i
took
a
deep
thankful
breath
her
mind
was
occupied
enough
to
keep
her
from
reading
the
dark
thoughts
that
were
going
through
mine
i
did
not
even
want
a
loved
one
to
know
how
utterly
helpless
and
angry
i
felt
and
then
because
i
was
preoccupied
with
catherine
and
my
own
thoughts
the
door
opened
without
my
having
taken
a
dig
at
the
opener
beforehand
the
arrival
was
all
i
needed
to
crack
wide
open
in
a
howling
fit
of
hysteria
it
was
so
pat
i
could
help
but
let
myself
go
well
this
looks
like
old
home
week
miss
gloria
farrow
registered
nurse
did
not
respond
to
my
awkward
joviality
her
face
if
anything
was
darker
than
my
thoughts
i
doubted
that
she
had
her
telepathy
working
people
who
get
that
wound
up
find
it
hard
to
even
see
and
hear
straight
let
alone
think
right
and
telepathy
or
perception
goes
out
of
kilter
first
because
the
psi
is
a
very
delicate
factor
she
eyed
me
coldly
you
utter
imbecile
she
snarled
you
whoa
baby
i
roared
slow
down
i
a
bit
less
than
bright
but
what
have
i
done
now
i
have
slapped
her
across
the
face
as
an
anodyne
if
she
had
been
mekstrom
farrow
cooled
visibly
then
her
face
sort
of
came
apart
and
she
sort
of
flopped
forward
onto
the
bed
and
buried
her
face
in
my
shoulder
i
could
help
but
make
comparisons
she
was
like
a
hunk
of
marble
warm
and
vibrant
like
having
a
statue
crying
on
my
shoulder
she
sagged
against
me
like
a
loose
bag
of
cement
and
her
hands
clutched
at
my
shoulder
blades
like
a
pair
of
a
big
juicy
tear
dropped
from
her
cheek
to
land
on
my
chest
and
i
was
actually
surprised
to
find
that
a
teardrop
from
a
mekstrom
did
not
land
like
a
drop
of
mercury
it
just
splashed
like
any
other
drop
of
water
spread
out
and
made
my
chest
wet
eventually
i
held
her
up
from
me
tried
to
shake
her
gently
and
said
now
what
the
shooting
all
about
farrow
she
shook
her
head
as
if
to
clear
her
thinking
gear
steve
she
said
in
a
quietly
serious
tone
i
been
such
an
utter
fool
you
not
unique
farrow
i
told
her
people
have
been
doing
damfool
stunts
since
i
know
she
broke
in
then
with
an
effort
at
she
added
there
must
be
a
different
version
of
that
garden
of
eden
story
eve
is
always
blamed
as
having
tempted
adam
somewhere
old
adam
must
have
been
slightly
to
blame
i
did
know
what
she
was
driving
toward
but
i
stroked
her
hair
and
waited
she
was
probably
right
it
still
takes
two
of
a
kind
to
make
one
pair
steve
get
out
of
here
while
you
safe
huh
i
blurted
what
cooks
farrow
i
was
a
nice
patsy
she
said
she
sat
up
and
wiped
her
eyes
i
was
a
fool
steve
if
james
thorndyke
had
asked
me
to
jump
off
the
roof
have
asked
him
direction
that
how
i
am
yes
something
was
beginning
to
form
now
i
led
you
on
steve
that
blinkoed
me
the
phrase
did
jell
the
half
a
minute
she
spent
bawling
on
my
shoulder
with
my
arms
around
her
had
been
the
first
physical
contact
i
ever
had
with
nurse
farrow
it
did
seem
no
steve
not
that
way
i
could
see
you
for
thorndyke
any
more
than
you
could
see
me
for
catherine
her
telepathy
had
returned
obviously
she
was
in
better
control
of
herself
steve
she
said
i
led
you
on
did
everything
that
thorndyke
told
me
to
you
fell
into
it
like
a
rock
oh
it
was
going
to
be
a
big
thing
all
i
had
to
do
was
to
haul
you
deeper
into
this
mess
then
i
disappear
strangely
then
be
tog
ether
we
be
she
started
to
come
unglued
again
but
stopped
the
dissolving
process
just
before
the
wet
and
gooey
stage
set
in
she
seemed
to
put
a
set
in
her
shoulders
and
then
she
looked
down
at
me
with
pity
poor
esper
she
said
softly
you
could
really
know
know
what
i
asked
harshly
he
fooled
me
too
she
said
in
what
sounded
like
a
complete
irrelevancy
look
farrow
try
and
make
a
bit
of
sense
to
a
poor
perceptive
who
ca
read
a
mind
keep
it
running
in
one
direction
please
again
as
apparently
irrelevant
she
said
he
a
top
grade
telepath
he
knows
control
control
i
asked
blankly
you
do
know
she
said
but
a
good
telepath
can
think
in
patterns
that
prevent
lesser
telepaths
from
really
digging
deep
thorndyke
is
brilliant
of
scholar
grade
really
he
let
get
back
to
it
farrow
what
cooking
sternly
she
tossed
her
head
it
was
an
angry
motion
one
that
showed
her
disdain
for
her
own
tears
and
her
own
weakness
your
own
sweet
catherine
i
eyed
her
not
coldly
but
with
a
growing
puzzlement
i
tried
to
formulate
my
own
idea
but
she
went
on
briskly
that
accident
of
yours
was
one
of
the
luckiest
things
that
ever
happened
to
you
steve
how
long
have
i
been
known
to
be
a
mekstrom
carrier
i
asked
bluntly
no
more
than
three
weeks
before
you
met
catherine
lewis
she
told
me
as
bluntly
it
took
the
medical
center
that
long
to
work
her
into
a
position
to
meet
you
steve
that
put
the
icing
on
the
cake
if
nothing
else
it
explained
why
catherine
was
here
willingly
i
did
really
believe
it
because
no
one
can
turn
one
hundred
and
eighty
degrees
without
effort
but
i
deny
the
fact
that
the
evidence
fits
the
claim
if
what
farrow
said
were
true
my
marriage
to
catherine
would
have
provided
them
with
the
same
lever
as
the
little
blonde
receptionist
the
must
have
really
fouled
up
their
plans
it
did
steve
said
farrow
who
had
been
following
my
mental
ramblings
the
highways
had
to
step
in
and
help
this
fouled
things
up
for
both
sides
both
sides
i
asked
completely
baffled
she
nodded
until
the
accident
the
medical
center
did
not
know
that
the
highways
existed
but
when
catherine
dropped
completely
out
of
sight
thorndyke
did
a
fine
job
of
probing
you
that
when
he
came
upon
the
scant
evidence
of
the
highway
sign
and
the
mental
impression
of
the
elder
harrison
lifting
the
car
so
that
phillip
could
get
you
out
then
he
knew
and
farrow
i
snapped
there
are
a
lot
of
holes
in
your
story
for
instance
she
held
up
a
hand
to
stop
me
steve
she
said
quietly
you
know
how
difficult
it
is
for
a
to
find
someone
he
can
trust
but
trying
to
convince
you
that
i
stopped
farrow
this
time
how
can
i
believe
you
now
i
asked
her
pointedly
you
seem
to
have
a
part
in
this
side
of
the
quiet
warfare
nurse
farrow
made
a
wry
face
as
though
she
just
discovered
that
the
stuff
she
had
in
her
mouth
was
a
ball
of
wooly
centipedes
i
a
woman
she
said
simply
i
soft
and
gullible
and
easily
talked
into
complacency
but
i
just
learned
that
their
willingness
to
accept
women
is
based
upon
the
fact
that
no
culture
can
thrive
without
women
to
propagate
the
race
i
find
that
i
am
she
paused
swallowed
and
her
voice
became
strained
with
bitterness
useful
as
a
breeding
animal
just
one
of
the
peasants
whose
glory
lies
in
carrying
their
heirs
but
i
tell
you
steve
and
here
she
became
strong
and
her
voice
rang
out
with
a
vigorous
rejection
of
her
future
i
be
forever
damned
if
i
will
let
my
child
be
raised
with
the
cockeyed
notion
that
he
has
some
right
to
rule
my
vigilant
sense
of
perception
had
detected
a
change
in
the
in
the
building
people
were
moving
no
it
was
one
person
who
was
moving
down
in
the
laboratory
below
and
at
the
other
end
of
the
building
catherine
was
still
working
over
the
autoclave
and
instruments
the
superintendent
had
taken
off
for
somewhere
else
and
while
catherine
was
alone
now
she
was
about
to
be
joined
by
thorndyke
half
afraid
that
my
perception
of
them
would
touch
off
their
own
telepathic
sense
of
danger
i
watched
deliberately
the
door
opened
and
thorndyke
came
in
catherine
turned
from
her
work
and
said
something
which
of
course
i
could
not
possibly
catch
what
are
they
saying
farrow
i
snapped
mentally
i
do
know
they
too
far
for
my
range
i
swore
but
i
did
really
have
to
have
a
dialog
script
nor
did
they
do
the
obvious
what
they
did
was
far
more
telling
catherine
turned
and
patted
his
cheek
they
laughed
at
one
another
and
then
catherine
began
handing
thorndyke
the
instruments
out
of
the
autoclave
which
he
proceeded
to
mix
in
an
unholy
mess
in
the
surgical
tray
catherine
saw
what
he
was
doing
and
made
some
remark
then
threatened
him
with
a
pair
of
haemostats
big
enough
to
clamp
off
a
fire
hose
it
was
pleasant
enough
looking
horseplay
the
sort
of
intimacy
that
people
have
when
they
been
together
for
a
long
time
thorndyke
did
not
look
at
all
frightened
of
the
haemostats
and
catherine
did
not
really
look
as
though
she
follow
through
with
her
threat
they
finally
tangled
in
a
wrestle
for
the
instrument
and
thorndyke
took
it
away
from
her
they
leaned
against
a
cabinet
side
by
side
their
elbows
touching
and
went
on
talking
as
if
they
had
something
important
to
discuss
in
the
midst
of
their
fun
it
could
have
been
reorientation
or
it
could
have
been
catherine
real
self
i
still
could
quite
believe
that
she
had
played
me
false
my
mind
spinned
from
one
side
to
the
other
until
i
came
up
with
a
blunt
question
that
came
to
my
lips
without
any
mental
planning
i
snapped
farrow
what
grade
of
telepath
is
catherine
doctor
grade
she
replied
flatly
might
have
taken
some
training
if
economics
had
interfered
i
not
really
call
her
rhine
scholar
material
but
i
prejudiced
against
her
if
what
farrow
said
was
true
catherine
was
telepath
enough
to
control
and
marshall
her
mind
to
a
faretheewell
she
could
think
and
plan
to
herself
in
the
presence
of
another
telepath
without
giving
her
plots
away
she
was
certainly
smart
enough
to
lead
one
perceptive
around
by
a
ring
in
my
nose
me
i
was
as
big
a
fool
as
farrow
xx
nurse
farrow
caught
my
hand
steve
she
snapped
out
in
a
rapid
flat
voice
think
only
one
thought
think
of
how
catherine
is
here
that
she
came
here
to
protect
your
life
and
your
future
huh
think
it
she
almost
cried
she
coming
i
nearly
fumbled
it
then
i
caught
on
catherine
was
coming
to
remove
the
little
finger
manipulator
and
to
have
a
with
me
i
want
to
see
her
and
i
was
beginning
to
wish
then
i
remembered
that
one
glimmer
out
of
me
that
i
knew
the
truth
and
everything
would
be
higher
than
orbital
station
one
i
shoved
my
mind
into
low
gear
and
started
to
think
idle
thoughts
letting
myself
sort
of
daydream
i
was
convincing
to
myself
it
hard
to
explain
exactly
but
i
was
like
a
dramatist
i
fell
into
it
it
seemed
almost
truth
to
me
as
i
roamed
on
and
on
i
been
trapped
and
catherine
had
come
here
to
hand
herself
over
as
a
hostage
against
my
good
behavior
she
escaped
the
highways
bunch
or
maybe
she
just
left
them
quietly
somehow
phelps
had
seen
to
it
that
catherine
got
word
i
did
know
how
but
that
was
not
important
the
important
thing
was
catherine
being
here
as
a
means
of
keeping
me
alive
and
well
i
went
on
thinking
the
lie
catherine
came
in
shortly
and
saw
what
nurse
farrow
was
doing
i
was
supposed
to
do
that
said
catherine
nurse
farrow
straightened
up
from
her
work
of
loosening
the
straps
on
the
manipulator
sorry
she
said
in
a
cool
crisp
voice
i
know
that
this
is
usually
my
job
it
a
rather
delicate
proposition
you
know
there
was
a
chill
of
professional
rebuff
in
farrow
voice
it
was
the
pert
white
hat
and
the
gold
pin
looking
down
upon
the
gray
uniform
with
no
adornment
catherine
looked
a
bit
uncomfortable
but
she
apparently
had
to
take
it
catherine
tried
lamely
you
see
cornell
is
my
fiancée
farrow
jumped
on
that
one
hard
i
aware
of
that
so
let
not
forget
that
scholars
of
medicine
do
not
treat
their
own
loved
ones
for
ethical
reasons
catherine
took
it
like
a
slap
across
the
face
with
an
iced
towel
sure
that
thorndyke
would
not
have
let
me
take
care
of
him
if
not
been
capable
she
replied
perhaps
thorndyke
did
not
realize
at
the
time
that
cornell
would
be
ready
for
the
treatment
department
or
she
added
slyly
have
you
been
trained
to
prepare
a
patient
for
the
full
treatment
the
full
treatment
thorndyke
did
not
seem
to
think
please
said
farrow
with
that
cold
crispness
coming
out
hard
as
a
nurse
i
must
keep
my
own
opinion
to
myself
as
well
as
keeping
the
opinions
of
doctors
to
myself
i
take
orders
only
and
i
perform
them
that
was
a
sharp
shot
practically
telling
catherine
that
she
as
a
nurses
helper
had
even
less
right
to
go
shooting
off
her
mouth
catherine
started
to
reply
but
gave
it
up
instead
she
came
over
and
looked
down
at
me
she
cooed
and
stroked
my
forehead
ah
steve
she
breathed
so
you
going
for
the
treatment
think
of
me
steve
do
let
it
hurt
too
much
i
smiled
thinly
and
looked
up
into
her
eyes
they
were
soft
and
warm
a
bit
moist
her
lips
were
full
and
red
and
they
were
parted
slightly
the
lower
lip
glistened
slightly
in
the
light
these
were
lips
i
kissed
and
found
sweet
a
face
i
held
between
my
hands
her
hair
fluffed
forward
a
trifle
threatened
to
cascade
down
over
her
shoulders
no
it
was
not
at
all
hard
to
lie
there
and
go
on
thinking
all
the
thoughts
i
once
hoped
might
come
true
she
recoiled
her
face
changing
swiftly
from
its
mask
of
sweet
concern
to
one
of
hard
calculation
i
slipped
with
that
last
hunk
of
thinking
and
given
the
whole
affair
away
catherine
straightened
up
and
turned
to
head
for
the
door
she
took
one
step
and
caved
in
like
a
wet
towel
over
her
body
i
saw
nurse
farrow
calmly
reloading
the
hypo
which
she
used
to
fire
a
second
load
into
the
base
of
catherine
neck
just
below
the
shoulder
blades
that
said
farrow
succinctly
should
keep
her
cold
for
a
week
i
just
wish
i
been
born
with
enough
guts
to
commit
murder
what
get
dressed
she
snapped
it
cold
outside
remember
i
started
to
dress
as
farrow
hurled
my
clothing
out
of
the
closet
at
me
she
went
on
in
the
meantime
i
knew
you
could
keep
it
entirely
concealed
from
her
she
too
good
a
telepath
so
while
you
were
holding
her
attention
i
let
her
have
a
shot
in
the
neck
one
of
the
rather
bad
things
about
being
a
mekstrom
is
that
minor
items
like
the
hypo
do
register
too
well
i
stopped
is
that
bad
seems
to
me
that
i
heard
that
pain
is
a
necessary
factor
for
the
preservation
of
the
stop
yapping
and
dress
snapped
farrow
pain
is
useful
when
needed
it
is
needed
in
the
case
of
a
pin
pricking
the
hide
of
a
mekstrom
when
a
mekstrom
gets
in
the
way
of
something
big
enough
to
damage
him
physically
then
it
hurts
him
sort
of
when
a
locomotive
falls
on
their
head
i
grunted
keep
on
dressing
we
not
out
of
this
jungle
yet
so
have
you
any
plans
she
nodded
soberly
yes
steve
once
you
asked
me
to
be
your
telepath
to
complete
your
team
i
let
you
down
now
i
picked
you
up
again
and
from
here
on
out
i
i
nodded
sold
i
told
her
good
now
steve
dig
the
hallway
i
did
there
was
no
one
there
i
opened
my
mouth
to
tell
her
so
and
then
closed
it
foolishly
dig
the
hallway
down
to
the
left
farther
to
the
door
down
there
three
beyond
the
one
you
perceiving
now
is
there
a
wheelchair
there
wheelchair
i
blurted
steve
this
is
a
hospital
they
do
even
let
a
man
with
an
aching
tooth
walk
to
the
toothache
ward
he
rides
now
you
keep
a
good
esper
watch
on
the
hall
and
if
anybody
looks
out
while
i
gone
just
cast
a
deep
dig
at
their
face
it
possible
that
at
this
close
range
i
can
identify
them
from
the
perceived
image
in
your
mind
although
god
knows
no
two
people
ever
anything
alike
let
alone
perceive
it
she
slipped
out
leaving
me
with
the
recumbent
form
of
my
former
sweetheart
her
face
had
fallen
into
the
relaxed
expression
of
sleep
sort
of
slack
and
unbuttoned
tough
baby
i
thought
as
i
closed
my
eyes
so
that
all
my
energy
could
be
aimed
at
the
use
of
my
perception
farrow
was
going
down
the
hall
like
a
professional
heading
for
the
wheelchair
on
a
strict
order
no
one
bothered
to
look
out
she
reached
the
locker
room
and
dusted
the
wheelchair
just
as
if
she
been
getting
it
for
a
real
patient
the
throb
in
my
finger
returned
for
a
parthian
shot
and
i
remembered
that
i
a
real
patient
she
trundled
the
chair
back
and
into
my
room
in
she
said
and
keep
that
perception
aimed
on
the
hallway
the
elevator
and
the
center
corridor
stairs
she
packed
me
with
a
blanket
tucking
it
so
that
my
shoes
and
overclothing
would
not
show
doing
the
job
briskly
then
she
scooped
catherine
up
from
the
floor
and
dropped
her
into
my
bed
and
then
rolled
catherine
into
one
of
those
hospital
doodads
that
hospitals
use
for
male
and
female
alike
as
bedclothing
anyone
taking
a
fast
dig
in
here
will
think
she
a
patient
unless
the
digger
knows
that
this
room
is
supposed
to
be
occupied
by
one
steve
cornell
obviously
male
now
steve
ready
to
steer
steer
steer
by
esper
i
drive
oh
i
know
the
way
she
told
me
with
a
chuckle
you
just
keep
your
perception
peeled
for
characters
who
might
be
i
handle
the
rest
we
went
along
the
hallway
i
took
fast
digs
at
the
rooms
and
hall
ahead
of
us
the
whole
coast
seemed
clear
waiting
for
the
elevator
was
nerve
wracking
hospitals
always
have
such
poky
elevators
but
eventually
it
came
and
we
trundled
aboard
the
pilot
was
no
he
smiled
at
nurse
farrow
and
nodded
genially
at
me
he
was
probably
a
blank
jockeying
an
elevator
is
about
the
top
job
for
a
these
days
but
as
the
elevator
started
down
a
doctor
came
out
of
one
of
the
rooms
on
the
floor
below
he
took
a
fast
look
at
the
indicator
above
the
elevator
door
and
made
a
dash
to
thumb
the
button
the
elevator
came
to
a
grinding
halt
and
he
got
on
this
bothered
me
but
farrow
merely
simpered
at
the
guy
and
melted
him
down
to
size
she
made
some
remark
to
him
that
i
could
hear
but
from
the
sudden
increase
of
his
pulse
rate
i
gathered
that
she
really
put
him
off
guard
he
replied
in
the
same
unintelligible
tone
and
reached
for
her
hand
she
held
his
hand
and
if
the
guy
was
thinking
of
me
my
name
is
sing
hoy
low
and
i
am
a
chinese
policeman
he
held
her
hand
until
we
hit
the
first
floor
and
he
debarked
with
a
glance
at
nurse
farrow
we
went
on
to
the
ground
floor
and
down
the
lower
corridor
to
the
end
where
farrow
spent
another
lifetime
and
a
half
filling
out
a
white
cardboard
form
the
superintendent
eyed
me
with
a
sniff
i
call
the
car
she
said
i
farrow
to
make
some
objection
but
she
quietly
nodded
and
we
waited
for
another
lifetime
until
a
big
car
whined
to
a
stop
outside
two
big
guys
in
white
coats
came
in
tripped
the
lever
on
back
of
the
wheelchair
and
stretched
me
out
flat
and
on
the
same
wheels
it
was
a
neat
conversion
from
wheelchair
to
wheeled
stretcher
but
as
farrow
trundled
me
out
feet
first
into
the
cold
i
felt
a
sort
of
nervous
chill
somewhere
south
of
my
navel
she
swung
me
around
at
the
last
minute
and
i
was
shoved
head
first
into
the
back
of
the
car
car
this
was
a
ambulance
about
as
long
as
a
city
block
and
as
heavy
as
a
battleship
it
was
completely
fitted
for
everything
that
anybody
could
think
of
including
a
great
big
muscular
power
plant
capable
of
putting
many
miles
per
behind
the
the
door
closed
on
my
feet
and
we
took
off
with
farrow
sitting
right
behind
the
two
big
hospital
attendants
one
of
whom
was
driving
and
the
other
of
whom
was
ogling
farrow
in
a
calculating
manner
she
invited
the
ogle
heck
she
did
it
in
such
a
way
that
i
could
help
ogling
a
bit
myself
if
i
have
said
that
farrow
was
an
attractive
woman
it
was
because
i
had
really
paid
attention
to
her
looks
but
now
i
went
along
and
ogled
realizing
in
the
dimmer
and
more
obscure
recesses
of
my
mind
that
if
i
ogled
in
a
loudly
lewd
perceptive
manner
i
not
be
thinking
of
what
she
was
doing
so
while
i
was
pleasantly
occupied
in
ogling
farrow
slipped
two
more
hypos
out
from
under
her
clothing
she
slipped
her
hands
out
sidewise
on
the
backs
of
their
seats
put
her
face
between
them
and
said
anybody
got
a
cigarette
fellows
the
next
that
took
place
happened
in
order
of
occurrence
as
follows
the
driver
grunted
and
turned
his
head
to
look
at
her
the
other
guy
fumbled
for
a
cigarette
driver
poked
at
the
lighter
on
the
dash
still
dividing
his
attention
between
the
road
and
nurse
farrow
the
man
beside
him
reached
for
the
lighter
when
it
popped
out
and
he
held
it
for
her
while
she
puffed
it
into
action
farrow
fingered
the
triggers
on
the
hypos
the
man
beside
the
driver
replaced
the
lighter
in
its
socket
on
the
dash
the
driver
slid
aside
and
to
the
floor
a
second
before
the
other
hospital
orderly
flopped
down
like
a
deflated
balloon
the
ambulance
took
a
swoop
to
the
right
nosed
down
into
a
shallow
ditch
and
leaped
like
a
shot
deer
out
on
the
other
side
farrow
went
over
the
back
of
the
seat
in
a
flurry
and
i
rolled
off
of
my
stretcher
into
the
angle
of
the
floor
and
the
sidewall
there
was
a
rumble
and
then
a
series
of
crashes
before
we
came
to
a
shuddering
halt
i
came
up
from
beneath
a
pile
of
assorted
medical
supplies
braced
myself
against
the
canted
deck
and
looked
out
the
the
trunk
of
a
tree
split
the
field
of
view
as
close
to
dead
center
as
it
could
be
out
steve
said
farrow
untangling
herself
from
the
steering
wheel
and
the
two
attendants
out
what
next
i
asked
her
we
made
enough
racket
to
wake
the
statue
of
lincoln
out
and
run
for
it
which
way
follow
me
she
snapped
and
took
off
even
in
nurse
shoes
with
those
farrow
made
time
in
a
phenomenal
way
i
lost
ground
steadily
luckily
it
was
still
early
in
the
afternoon
so
i
used
my
perception
to
keep
track
of
her
once
she
got
out
of
sight
she
was
following
the
gently
rolling
ground
keeping
to
the
lower
hollows
and
gradually
heading
toward
a
group
of
buildings
off
in
the
i
caught
up
with
her
just
as
we
hit
a
tiny
patch
of
dead
area
just
inside
the
area
she
stopped
and
we
flopped
on
the
ground
and
panted
our
lungs
full
of
nice
biting
cold
air
then
she
pointed
at
the
collection
of
buildings
and
said
steve
take
a
few
steps
out
of
this
deadness
and
take
a
fast
dig
look
for
cars
i
nodded
in
a
few
steps
i
could
send
my
esper
forward
to
dig
the
fact
that
there
were
several
cars
parked
in
a
row
near
one
of
the
buildings
i
wasted
no
time
in
digging
any
deeper
i
just
retreated
into
the
dead
area
and
told
her
what
i
seen
take
another
dig
steve
take
a
dig
for
ignition
keys
we
got
to
steal
i
do
mind
stealing
i
took
another
trip
into
the
open
section
and
gandered
at
ignition
locks
i
tried
to
memorize
the
ones
with
keys
hanging
in
the
locks
but
failed
to
remember
all
of
them
okay
steve
this
is
where
we
walk
in
boldly
and
walk
up
to
a
couple
of
cars
and
get
in
and
drive
off
yeah
but
why
that
the
only
way
we
ever
get
out
of
here
she
told
me
firmly
i
shrugged
farrow
knew
more
about
the
medical
center
than
i
did
if
that
the
way
she
figured
it
that
the
way
it
had
to
be
we
broke
out
of
the
dead
area
and
as
we
came
into
the
open
farrow
linked
her
arm
in
mine
and
hugged
it
make
like
a
couple
of
fatuous
mushbirds
she
chuckled
we
been
out
walking
and
communing
with
nature
and
getting
acquainted
is
the
fact
that
you
mekstrom
and
i
human
likely
to
cause
some
rather
pointed
comment
it
would
if
we
were
to
stick
around
to
hear
it
she
said
and
if
they
try
to
read
our
minds
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
think
nice
mushy
thoughts
face
it
she
said
quietly
it
wo
be
hard
huh
you
a
rather
nice
guy
steve
you
fast
on
the
uptake
generally
pleasant
you
got
an
awful
lot
of
grit
guts
and
determination
steve
you
no
pinup
boy
steve
but
and
this
may
come
as
a
shock
to
you
women
do
put
the
stock
in
pulchritude
that
men
do
you
hey
whoa
i
bubbled
slow
down
before
you
she
hugged
my
arm
again
steve
she
said
seriously
i
not
in
love
with
you
it
not
possible
for
a
woman
to
be
in
love
with
a
man
who
does
not
return
that
love
you
do
love
me
but
you
ca
help
but
admit
that
i
am
an
attractive
woman
steve
and
perhaps
under
other
circumstances
you
take
on
a
large
load
of
that
old
feeling
i
admit
that
the
reverse
could
easily
take
place
now
let
forget
all
the
odd
angles
and
start
thinking
like
a
pair
of
people
for
whom
the
time
the
place
and
the
opposite
sex
all
turned
up
opportunely
i
could
help
thinking
of
nurse
farrow
as
nurse
farrow
the
name
gloria
did
not
quite
come
out
i
tried
to
submerge
this
mental
attitude
and
so
i
looked
down
at
her
with
what
i
hoped
to
resemble
the
expression
of
a
male
i
think
it
was
closer
to
the
expression
of
a
actor
expressing
lust
and
not
quite
making
the
grade
farrow
giggled
but
as
i
sort
of
leered
down
at
her
i
had
to
admit
upon
proper
examination
of
her
charm
that
nurse
farrow
could
very
easily
become
gloria
if
as
she
said
we
had
the
time
to
let
the
change
occur
another
idea
formed
in
my
mind
if
farrow
had
been
kicked
in
the
emotions
by
thorndyke
i
equally
been
pushed
in
the
face
by
catherine
that
made
us
sort
of
kindred
souls
as
they
used
to
call
it
in
the
early
books
of
the
twentieth
century
gloria
farrow
chuckled
unlike
the
old
of
that
day
she
said
we
rebound
a
bit
too
fast
then
she
let
my
arm
go
and
took
my
hand
we
went
swinging
across
the
field
in
a
sort
of
happy
comradeship
it
must
have
looked
as
though
we
were
friends
she
was
a
good
egg
hurt
and
beaten
down
and
shoved
off
by
thorndyke
but
she
had
a
lot
of
the
good
old
bounce
of
a
sudden
impulse
i
wanted
to
kiss
her
go
ahead
steve
she
said
but
it
be
for
the
probable
onlookers
i
mekstrom
you
know
so
i
did
try
i
just
put
an
arm
around
her
briefly
and
realized
that
any
attempt
at
affection
would
be
like
trying
to
strike
sparks
off
flint
with
a
hunk
of
flannel
we
walked
hand
in
hand
towards
the
buildings
strolled
up
saucily
towards
two
of
the
parked
cars
made
the
sort
of
wave
that
lovers
give
one
another
in
goodbye
when
they
do
really
want
to
demonstrate
their
affection
before
ten
thousand
people
and
stepped
into
two
cars
and
took
off
gloria
farrow
was
in
the
lead
we
went
howling
down
the
road
farrow
in
the
lead
car
by
a
hundred
feet
and
me
behind
her
we
went
roaring
around
a
curve
over
a
hill
and
i
had
my
perception
out
to
its
range
which
was
far
ahead
of
her
car
the
main
gate
came
into
range
and
we
bore
down
upon
that
wire
and
steel
portal
like
a
pair
of
madmen
gloria
farrow
plowed
into
the
gate
without
letting
up
the
gate
went
whirling
in
pieces
glass
flew
and
tires
howled
and
bits
of
metal
and
plastic
sang
through
the
air
her
car
weaved
aside
i
forgot
the
road
ahead
and
put
my
perception
into
her
car
farrow
was
fighting
the
wheel
like
a
racing
driver
in
a
spin
her
hands
wrenched
the
wheel
with
the
swift
strength
of
the
mekstrom
flesh
she
wore
and
the
wheel
bent
under
her
hands
over
and
around
she
went
with
a
tire
blown
and
the
lower
rail
of
the
big
gate
hanging
onto
the
fender
like
a
she
juggled
the
wheel
and
made
a
snaky
path
off
to
one
side
of
the
road
out
of
the
guardhouse
came
a
uniformed
man
with
a
riot
gun
he
did
not
have
time
to
raise
it
farrow
ironed
out
her
course
and
aimed
the
careening
car
dead
center
she
mowed
the
guard
down
and
a
of
a
second
later
she
plowed
into
the
guardhouse
the
structure
erupted
like
a
box
of
hit
with
a
slug
like
a
house
of
cards
and
an
there
was
a
roar
and
a
small
gout
of
flame
and
then
out
of
the
flying
wreckage
on
the
far
side
came
farrow
and
her
stolen
car
out
of
the
mess
of
brimstone
and
shingles
she
came
turning
end
for
end
in
a
crazy
twist
and
spin
she
ground
to
a
broken
halt
before
the
last
of
the
debris
landed
and
then
everything
was
silent
and
then
for
the
first
and
only
time
in
my
life
i
felt
the
penetrant
forceful
impact
of
an
incoming
thought
a
mental
contact
from
another
mind
steve
it
screamed
in
my
mind
get
out
get
going
it
your
move
now
i
put
my
foot
on
the
faucet
and
poured
on
the
oil
xxi
my
car
leaped
forward
and
i
headed
along
the
outside
road
towards
the
nearby
highway
through
the
busted
gate
i
roared
past
the
downed
guard
and
the
smashed
guardhouse
past
the
wreck
of
farrow
car
but
nurse
farrow
was
not
finished
with
this
gambit
yet
as
i
drew
even
with
her
she
pried
herself
out
of
the
messy
tangle
and
came
across
the
field
in
a
dead
run
and
how
that
girl
could
run
as
fast
as
i
was
going
she
caught
up
as
fast
as
it
all
happened
i
had
too
little
time
to
slow
me
down
before
nurse
farrow
closed
the
intervening
distance
from
her
wreck
to
my
car
and
had
hooked
her
arm
in
through
one
open
window
my
car
lurched
with
the
impact
but
i
fought
the
wheel
straight
again
and
farrow
snapped
keep
going
steve
i
kept
going
farrow
snaked
herself
inside
and
flopped
into
the
seat
beside
me
now
she
said
patting
the
dashboard
of
our
car
it
up
to
the
both
of
us
now
do
talk
steve
just
drive
like
crazy
where
she
laughed
a
weak
little
chuckle
anywhere
so
long
as
it
a
long
long
way
from
here
i
nodded
and
settled
down
to
some
fancy
farrow
relaxed
in
the
seat
opened
the
glove
compartment
and
took
out
a
first
aid
kit
it
was
only
then
i
noticed
that
she
was
banged
up
quite
a
bit
for
a
mekstrom
i
not
been
too
surprised
when
she
emerged
from
the
wreck
i
become
used
to
the
idea
of
the
indestructibility
of
the
mekstrom
i
was
a
bit
surprised
at
her
being
banged
up
i
become
so
used
to
their
hide
that
the
idea
of
minor
cuts
scars
mars
and
abrasions
had
occurred
to
me
yes
that
wreck
would
have
mangled
a
normal
man
into
an
unrecognizable
mess
of
hamburger
yet
i
expected
a
mekstrom
to
come
through
it
unscathed
on
the
other
hand
the
damage
to
farrow
body
was
really
minor
she
bled
from
a
long
gash
on
her
thigh
from
a
wound
on
her
right
arm
and
from
a
myriad
of
little
cuts
on
her
face
neck
and
shoulders
so
as
i
drove
away
from
the
medical
center
nurse
farrow
relaxed
in
the
seat
and
applied
adhesive
tape
compresses
and
closed
the
gashes
with
a
batch
of
little
skin
clips
in
lieu
of
sutures
then
she
lit
two
cigarettes
and
handed
one
of
them
to
me
okay
now
steve
she
said
easily
let
drive
a
little
less
crazily
i
pulled
the
car
down
to
a
flat
hundred
and
felt
the
strain
go
out
of
me
as
i
remember
there
one
of
the
highways
not
far
from
here
she
shook
her
head
no
steve
we
do
want
the
highways
in
hiding
either
at
a
mere
hundred
per
i
could
let
my
esper
do
the
so
i
looked
over
at
her
she
was
but
beneath
the
little
smile
was
a
firm
look
of
no
she
said
quietly
we
want
the
highways
if
we
go
there
phelps
and
his
outfit
will
turn
heaven
and
earth
to
break
it
up
now
that
you
become
so
important
you
forget
that
the
medical
center
is
still
being
run
to
look
legal
and
aboveboard
while
the
highways
are
still
in
hiding
phelps
could
make
quite
a
bitter
case
out
of
their
reluctance
to
come
out
into
the
open
well
where
do
we
go
i
asked
west
she
said
simply
west
into
new
mexico
to
my
home
this
sort
of
startled
me
somehow
i
not
connected
farrow
with
any
permanent
home
as
a
nurse
and
later
as
one
of
the
medical
center
come
to
think
of
her
as
having
no
permanent
home
of
her
own
yet
like
the
rest
of
us
nurse
farrow
had
been
brought
up
in
a
home
with
a
mother
and
a
father
and
probably
some
sisters
and
brothers
mine
were
dead
and
the
original
home
disbanded
but
there
was
no
reason
why
i
should
think
of
everybody
else
in
the
same
terms
after
all
catherine
had
had
a
mother
and
a
father
who
come
to
see
me
after
her
disappearance
so
we
went
west
across
southern
illinois
and
over
the
big
bridge
at
louis
into
missouri
and
across
missouri
and
west
west
west
we
parked
nights
in
small
motels
and
took
turns
sleeping
with
one
of
us
always
awake
and
alert
with
esper
and
telepath
senses
geared
high
for
the
first
sight
of
any
threat
we
gave
the
highways
we
came
upon
a
wide
berth
at
no
time
did
we
come
close
to
any
of
their
way
stations
it
made
our
path
crooked
and
much
longer
than
it
might
have
been
if
we
strung
a
line
and
gone
but
eventually
we
ended
up
in
a
small
town
in
new
mexico
and
at
a
small
ranch
house
on
the
edge
of
the
town
it
is
nice
to
have
parents
i
missed
my
own
deeply
when
i
was
reminded
of
the
sweet
wonder
of
having
people
just
plain
glad
to
see
their
children
again
no
matter
what
they
done
under
any
circumstances
even
bringing
a
into
their
homes
for
an
extended
course
of
treatment
john
farrow
was
a
tall
man
with
gray
at
the
temples
and
a
pair
of
sharp
blue
eyes
that
missed
nothing
he
was
a
fair
perceptive
who
might
have
been
quite
proficient
if
he
had
taken
the
full
psi
course
at
some
university
farrow
was
the
kind
of
elderly
woman
that
any
man
would
like
to
have
for
a
mother
she
was
sweet
and
gentle
but
there
was
neither
foolish
softness
or
fatuous
nonsense
about
her
she
was
a
telepath
and
she
knew
her
way
around
and
let
people
know
that
she
knew
what
the
score
was
farrow
had
a
brother
james
who
was
not
at
home
he
lived
in
town
with
his
wife
but
came
out
to
the
old
homestead
about
once
every
week
on
some
errand
or
other
they
took
me
in
as
though
i
come
home
with
their
daughter
for
sentimental
reasons
gloria
sat
with
us
in
their
living
room
and
went
through
the
whole
story
interrupted
now
and
then
by
a
remark
aimed
at
me
they
inspected
my
hand
and
agreed
that
something
must
be
done
they
were
extremely
interested
in
the
mekstrom
problem
and
were
amazed
at
their
daughter
feats
of
strength
and
endurance
my
hand
by
this
time
was
beginning
to
throb
again
the
infection
was
heading
on
a
fine
start
down
the
pinky
and
middle
fingers
the
ring
finger
was
approaching
the
second
joint
to
that
point
where
the
advance
stopped
long
enough
for
the
infection
to
become
complete
before
it
crossed
the
joint
the
first
waves
of
that
particular
pain
were
coming
at
intervals
and
i
knew
that
within
a
few
hours
the
pain
would
become
waves
of
agony
so
deep
that
i
would
not
be
able
to
stand
it
ultimately
farrow
got
her
brother
james
to
come
out
from
town
with
his
tools
and
between
us
all
we
rigged
up
a
small
manipulator
for
my
hand
farrow
performed
the
medical
operations
from
the
kit
in
the
back
of
her
car
we
stolen
from
the
medical
center
then
after
they
put
my
hand
through
the
next
phase
nurse
farrow
looked
me
over
and
gave
the
opinion
that
it
was
now
approaching
the
time
for
me
to
get
the
rest
of
the
full
treatment
one
evening
i
went
to
bed
to
be
in
bed
for
four
solid
months
i
like
to
be
able
to
give
a
blow
by
blow
description
of
those
four
solid
months
unfortunately
i
was
under
dope
so
much
of
the
time
that
i
know
little
about
it
it
was
not
pleasant
my
arm
laid
like
a
log
from
the
petrified
forest
strapped
into
the
machine
that
moved
the
joints
with
regular
motion
and
with
each
motion
starting
a
dart
of
fire
and
mangling
pain
up
to
the
shoulder
needles
entered
the
veins
at
the
elbow
and
the
armpit
and
from
bottles
suspended
almost
to
the
ceiling
to
provide
a
pressurehead
plasma
and
was
trickled
in
to
keep
the
arm
alive
dimly
i
recall
having
the
other
arm
strapped
down
and
the
waves
of
pain
that
blasted
at
me
from
both
sides
the
only
way
i
kept
from
going
out
of
my
mind
with
the
pain
was
living
from
hypo
to
hypo
and
waiting
for
the
blessed
blackness
that
wiped
out
the
agony
only
to
come
out
of
it
hours
later
with
my
infection
advanced
to
another
point
of
pain
when
the
infection
reached
my
right
shoulder
it
stopped
for
a
long
time
the
infection
rose
up
my
left
arm
and
also
stopped
at
the
shoulder
i
came
out
of
the
dope
to
find
james
and
his
father
fitting
one
of
the
manipulators
to
my
right
leg
and
through
that
i
could
feel
the
darting
pains
in
my
calf
and
thigh
at
those
few
times
when
my
mind
was
clear
enough
to
let
me
use
my
perception
i
dug
the
room
and
found
that
i
was
lying
in
a
veritable
forest
of
bottles
and
rubber
tubes
and
a
swathe
of
bandages
utterly
helpless
i
vaguely
knew
that
i
was
being
cared
for
in
every
way
the
periods
of
clarity
were
fewer
now
and
shorter
when
they
came
i
awoke
once
to
find
my
throat
paralyzed
and
again
to
find
that
my
jaw
tongue
and
lower
face
was
a
solid
pincushion
of
darting
needles
of
fire
later
my
ears
reported
not
a
sound
and
even
later
still
i
awoke
to
find
myself
strapped
into
a
portable
resuscitator
that
moved
my
chest
up
and
down
with
an
inexorable
force
that
about
all
i
know
of
it
when
the
smoke
cleared
away
completely
and
the
veil
across
my
eyes
was
gone
it
was
spring
outside
and
i
was
a
mekstrom
i
sat
up
in
bed
it
was
morning
the
sun
was
streaming
in
the
window
brightly
and
the
fresh
morning
air
of
spring
stirred
the
curtains
gently
it
was
quite
warm
and
the
smell
that
came
in
from
the
outside
was
alive
with
newborn
greenery
it
felt
good
just
to
be
alive
the
hanging
bottles
and
festoons
of
rubber
hose
were
gone
the
crude
manipulators
had
been
stowed
somewhere
and
the
bottles
of
medicine
and
stuff
were
missing
from
the
bureau
there
was
even
a
thermometer
in
a
glass
anywhere
within
the
range
of
my
vision
and
frankly
i
was
so
glad
to
be
alive
again
that
i
did
not
see
any
point
to
digging
through
the
joint
with
my
perception
to
find
the
location
of
the
medical
junk
instead
i
just
wanted
to
get
up
and
run
i
did
take
a
swing
at
the
clothes
closet
and
found
my
stuff
then
i
took
a
mild
pass
at
the
house
located
the
bathroom
and
also
assured
myself
that
no
one
was
likely
to
interrupt
me
i
was
going
to
shave
and
shower
and
dress
and
go
downstairs
i
was
just
shrugging
myself
up
and
out
of
bed
when
nurse
farrow
came
bustling
up
the
stairs
and
into
the
room
with
no
preamble
hi
i
greeted
her
i
was
going
to
surprise
us
she
said
quickly
i
know
so
i
came
up
to
see
that
you
do
get
into
trouble
trouble
i
asked
pausing
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
you
a
mekstrom
steve
she
told
me
unnecessarily
then
she
caught
my
thought
and
went
on
it
necessary
to
remind
you
you
have
to
learn
how
to
control
your
strength
steve
i
flexed
my
arms
they
did
feel
any
different
i
pinched
my
muscle
with
my
other
hand
and
it
pinched
just
as
it
always
had
i
took
a
deep
breath
and
the
air
went
in
pleasantly
and
come
out
again
i
do
feel
any
different
i
told
her
she
smiled
and
handed
me
a
common
wooden
lead
pencil
write
your
name
she
directed
think
i
have
to
learn
all
over
i
grinned
i
took
the
pencil
put
my
fist
down
on
the
top
of
the
bureau
above
a
pad
of
paper
and
chuckled
at
farrow
now
let
see
my
first
initial
is
the
letter
made
by
starting
at
the
top
and
coming
around
in
a
sweeping
graceful
curve
like
this
it
did
come
around
in
any
curve
as
the
lead
point
hit
the
paper
it
bore
down
in
flicked
off
the
tip
and
then
crunched
down
breaking
off
the
point
and
splintering
the
thin
whittled
wood
for
about
an
eighth
of
an
inch
the
fact
that
i
could
not
control
it
bothered
me
inside
and
i
instinctively
clutched
at
the
shaft
of
the
pencil
it
cracked
in
three
places
in
my
hand
the
top
end
with
the
eraser
fell
down
over
my
wrist
to
the
bureau
top
and
rolled
in
a
rapid
rattle
to
the
edge
where
it
fell
to
the
floor
see
asked
farrow
softly
but
i
blundered
uncertainly
steve
your
muscles
and
your
nervous
system
have
been
stepped
up
proportionately
you
got
to
the
coordination
between
the
and
the
feedback
information
from
the
work
you
are
doing
i
began
to
see
what
she
meant
i
remembered
long
years
ago
at
school
when
we
been
studying
some
of
the
new
alloys
and
there
had
been
a
sample
of
a
alloy
that
was
machined
into
a
smooth
cylinder
about
four
inches
in
diameter
and
a
foot
long
it
looked
like
hard
steel
people
who
picked
it
up
for
the
first
time
invariably
braced
their
muscles
and
set
both
hands
on
it
but
it
was
so
light
that
their
initial
effort
almost
tossed
the
bar
through
the
ceiling
and
even
long
after
we
all
knew
it
was
hard
not
to
attack
the
bar
without
using
the
experience
of
our
mind
and
sense
that
told
us
that
any
bar
of
metal
big
had
to
be
heavy
i
went
to
a
chair
farrow
said
be
careful
and
i
was
but
it
was
no
trick
at
all
to
take
the
chair
by
one
leg
at
the
bottom
and
lift
it
chin
high
now
go
take
your
shower
she
told
me
but
steve
please
be
careful
of
the
plumbing
you
can
twist
off
the
faucet
handles
you
know
i
nodded
and
turned
to
her
holding
out
a
hand
farrow
you
a
brick
she
took
my
hand
it
was
not
steel
hard
it
was
warm
and
firm
and
pleasant
it
was
holding
hands
with
a
woman
farrow
stepped
back
one
thing
you
have
to
remember
she
said
cheerfully
is
only
to
mix
with
your
own
kind
from
now
on
now
go
get
that
shower
and
shave
i
be
getting
breakfast
showering
was
not
hard
and
i
remembered
not
to
twist
off
the
handles
shaving
was
easy
although
i
had
to
change
razor
blades
three
times
in
the
process
i
broke
all
the
teeth
out
of
the
comb
because
it
was
never
intended
to
be
pulled
through
a
thicket
of
piano
wire
getting
dressed
was
something
else
i
caught
my
heel
in
one
trouser
leg
and
shredded
the
cloth
i
broke
the
buckle
on
my
belt
my
shoelaces
went
like
parting
a
length
of
wet
spaghetti
the
button
on
the
top
of
my
shirt
pinched
off
and
when
i
gave
that
final
jerk
to
my
necktie
it
pulled
the
knot
down
into
something
about
the
size
of
a
pea
breakfast
was
very
pleasant
although
i
bent
the
fork
tines
spearing
a
rasher
of
bacon
and
removed
the
handle
of
my
coffee
cup
without
half
trying
after
breakfast
i
discovered
that
i
could
not
remove
a
cigarette
from
the
package
without
pinching
the
end
down
flat
and
after
i
succeeded
in
getting
one
into
my
mouth
by
treating
both
smoke
and
match
as
if
they
were
made
of
tissue
paper
my
first
drag
on
the
smoke
lit
a
howling
on
the
end
that
consumed
half
of
the
cigarette
in
the
first
puff
you
going
to
take
some
school
before
you
are
fit
to
walk
among
normal
people
steve
said
gloria
with
amused
interest
you
informing
me
i
asked
with
some
dismay
eyeing
the
wreckage
left
in
my
wake
compared
to
the
new
steve
cornell
the
famous
bull
in
the
china
shop
was
gentle
ferdinand
i
picked
up
the
cigarette
package
again
it
squoze
down
even
though
i
tried
to
treat
it
gentle
i
felt
like
lenny
pinching
the
head
off
of
the
mouse
i
also
felt
about
as
much
of
a
bumbling
idiot
as
lenny
too
my
went
on
before
through
and
after
breakfast
i
manhandled
old
books
from
the
attic
i
shredded
newspapers
i
ruined
some
more
lead
pencils
and
finally
broke
the
pencil
sharpener
to
boot
i
put
an
elbow
through
the
middle
panel
of
the
kitchen
door
without
even
feeling
it
and
then
managed
to
twist
off
the
door
knob
generally
operating
like
a
army
of
vandals
i
laid
waste
to
the
farrow
home
having
thus
ruined
a
nice
house
gloria
decided
to
try
my
strength
on
her
car
i
was
much
too
fast
and
too
hard
on
the
brakes
which
of
course
was
not
too
bad
because
my
foot
was
also
too
insensitive
on
the
we
took
off
like
a
rocket
being
launched
and
then
i
tromped
on
the
brakes
bending
the
pedal
which
brought
us
down
sharp
like
hitting
a
haystack
this
allowed
our
heads
to
catch
up
with
the
rest
of
us
sure
that
if
we
been
human
beings
we
have
had
our
spines
snapped
eventually
i
learned
that
everything
had
to
be
handled
as
if
it
were
tissue
paper
and
gradually
my
reflexes
to
take
proper
cognizance
of
the
feedback
data
according
to
my
new
body
we
returned
home
after
a
hectic
twenty
miles
of
roadwork
and
i
broke
the
glass
as
i
slammed
the
car
door
it
going
to
take
time
i
admitted
with
some
reluctance
it
always
does
smiled
farrow
as
cheerfully
as
if
i
had
ruined
their
possessions
i
do
know
how
i
going
to
face
your
folks
farrow
smile
became
cryptic
maybe
they
wo
notice
now
look
farrow
steve
do
forget
for
the
moment
that
you
the
only
known
mekstrom
carrier
in
other
words
your
parents
are
due
for
the
treatment
next
oh
i
was
most
thorough
both
of
them
are
in
the
final
stages
right
now
i
sure
that
anything
you
did
to
the
joint
will
only
be
added
to
by
the
time
they
get
to
the
walking
stage
and
also
anything
you
did
they
feel
well
repaid
i
did
do
anything
for
them
you
provided
them
with
mekstrom
bodies
she
said
simply
they
took
to
it
willingly
yes
as
soon
as
they
were
convinced
by
watching
me
and
my
strength
they
knew
what
it
would
be
like
but
they
were
all
for
it
you
been
a
very
busy
girl
i
told
her
she
just
nodded
then
she
looked
up
at
me
with
troubled
eyes
and
asked
what
are
you
going
to
do
now
steve
i
going
to
haul
the
whole
shebang
down
like
samson
in
the
temple
a
lot
of
innocent
people
are
going
to
get
hurt
if
you
do
that
i
ca
very
well
find
a
cave
in
antarctica
and
hide
i
replied
glumly
think
a
bit
steve
could
either
side
afford
to
let
you
walk
into
new
washington
with
the
living
proof
of
your
mekstrom
body
did
stop
before
i
thought
angrily
and
it
seems
to
me
that
both
sides
were
sort
of
urging
me
to
go
and
do
something
that
would
uncover
the
other
not
deep
enough
said
farrow
that
was
only
during
the
early
phases
go
back
to
the
day
when
you
did
know
what
was
going
on
i
grunted
sourly
look
farrow
tell
me
why
must
i
fumble
my
way
through
this
as
i
fumbled
through
everything
else
because
only
by
coming
to
the
conclusion
in
your
own
way
will
you
be
convinced
that
someone
is
lying
to
you
now
think
it
over
steve
it
made
sense
even
if
i
came
to
the
wrong
conclusion
i
believe
it
more
than
if
someone
had
told
me
farrow
nodded
following
my
thoughts
then
i
plunged
in
first
we
have
a
man
who
is
found
to
be
a
carrier
of
mekstrom
disease
he
does
know
anything
about
the
disease
right
farrow
nodded
slowly
so
now
the
medical
center
puts
an
anchor
onto
their
carrier
by
sicking
an
attractive
dame
on
his
trail
um
at
this
point
i
went
into
a
bit
of
a
mental
trying
to
find
an
answer
to
one
of
the
puzzlers
farrow
just
looked
at
me
with
a
expression
waiting
i
came
out
of
the
after
six
times
around
the
circuit
and
went
on
i
do
know
all
the
factors
obviously
catherine
had
to
lead
me
fast
because
we
had
to
marry
before
she
contracted
the
disease
from
me
but
there
a
discrepancy
farrow
the
little
blonde
receptionist
caught
it
in
hours
steve
said
farrow
this
is
one
i
have
to
explain
since
not
a
medical
person
the
period
of
incubation
depends
upon
the
type
of
contact
you
actually
bit
the
receptionist
that
put
blood
contact
into
it
you
did
draw
any
blood
from
catherine
we
were
pretty
close
i
said
with
a
slight
reddening
of
the
ears
from
a
medical
standpoint
you
were
not
much
closer
to
catherine
than
you
have
been
to
me
or
thorndyke
you
were
closer
to
thorndyke
and
me
say
than
you
been
to
many
of
the
incidental
parties
along
the
path
of
our
travels
well
let
that
angle
go
for
the
moment
anyway
catherine
and
i
had
to
marry
before
the
initial
traces
were
evident
then
i
be
in
the
position
of
a
man
whose
wife
had
contracted
mekstrom
disease
on
our
honeymoon
whereupon
the
medical
center
would
step
in
and
cure
her
and
i
be
in
the
position
of
being
forever
grateful
and
willing
to
do
anything
that
the
medical
center
wanted
me
to
do
and
as
a
poor
i
probably
never
learn
the
truth
right
so
far
she
said
still
in
a
noncommittal
tone
so
now
we
crack
up
along
the
highway
near
the
harrison
place
the
highways
take
her
in
because
they
take
any
victim
in
no
matter
what
i
also
presume
from
what
gone
on
that
catherine
is
a
high
enough
telepath
to
conceal
her
thinking
and
so
to
become
an
undercover
agent
in
the
midst
of
the
highways
organization
and
at
this
point
the
long
long
trail
takes
a
fork
does
it
the
medical
center
gang
did
not
know
about
the
highways
in
hiding
until
catherine
and
i
barrelled
into
it
end
over
end
farrow
face
softened
and
although
she
said
nothing
i
knew
i
was
on
the
right
track
so
at
this
point
i
went
on
silently
medical
center
found
themselves
in
a
mild
quandary
they
could
hardly
put
another
woman
on
my
trail
because
i
was
already
emotionally
involved
with
the
missing
catherine
and
so
they
decided
to
use
me
in
another
way
i
was
shown
enough
to
keep
me
busy
i
was
more
or
less
urged
to
go
track
down
the
highways
in
hiding
for
the
medical
center
after
all
as
soon
as
made
the
initial
discovery
phelps
and
his
outfit
should
have
needed
any
more
a
bit
more
thinking
steve
you
come
up
with
that
answer
before
sure
phelps
wanted
me
to
take
my
tale
to
the
government
about
this
secret
highway
outfit
but
if
neither
side
can
afford
to
have
the
secret
come
out
how
come
i
pondered
this
for
a
long
time
and
admitted
that
it
made
no
sense
to
me
finally
farrow
shook
her
head
and
said
steve
i
got
to
prompt
you
now
and
then
but
remember
that
trying
to
make
you
think
it
out
yourself
now
consider
you
are
running
an
organization
that
must
be
kept
secret
then
someone
learns
the
secret
and
starts
heading
for
the
authorities
what
is
your
next
move
okay
i
replied
so
i
stupid
naturally
i
pull
in
my
horns
hide
my
signs
and
make
like
nothing
was
going
on
so
stopping
the
advance
of
your
organization
which
is
all
that
phelps
really
can
expect
i
thought
some
more
and
the
fact
that
i
was
carrying
a
story
that
would
get
me
popped
into
the
nearest
hatch
for
the
incipient
paranoid
made
it
all
right
she
nodded
and
now
she
asked
me
and
now
i
living
proof
of
my
story
is
that
right
right
and
steve
do
not
forget
for
one
moment
that
the
only
reason
that
you
still
alive
is
because
you
are
valuable
to
both
sides
alive
dead
you
only
good
for
a
small
quantity
of
mekstrom
inoculation
do
follow
i
grunted
as
you
say
i
no
medical
person
alive
your
hair
grows
and
must
be
cut
you
shave
and
trim
off
beard
your
fingernails
are
pared
now
and
then
you
lose
a
small
bit
of
hide
or
a
few
milliliters
of
blood
these
are
things
that
when
injected
under
the
skin
of
a
normal
human
makes
them
mekstrom
dead
your
ground
up
body
would
not
provide
much
substance
pleasant
prospect
i
growled
so
what
do
i
do
to
avert
this
future
steve
i
do
know
i
done
what
i
can
for
you
i
effected
the
cure
and
i
done
it
in
safety
you
still
steve
cornell
xxii
look
i
blurted
with
a
sudden
rush
of
brain
to
the
head
if
i
so
important
to
both
sides
how
come
you
managed
to
sequester
me
for
four
months
we
do
have
the
laws
of
privacy
said
farrow
simply
which
neither
side
can
afford
to
flout
overtly
furthermore
since
neither
side
really
knew
where
you
were
they
been
busily
prowling
one
another
camps
and
locking
up
the
prowlers
from
one
another
camps
and
playing
spy
and
counterspy
and
and
generally
piling
it
up
she
finished
with
a
chuckle
you
got
away
with
following
that
letter
to
catherine
because
uppermost
in
your
mind
was
the
brain
of
a
lover
hunting
down
his
missing
sweetheart
no
one
could
go
looking
for
steve
cornell
mekstrom
carrier
for
reasons
not
intrinsically
private
for
four
months
i
asked
still
incredulous
well
one
of
the
angles
is
that
both
sides
knew
you
were
immobilized
somewhere
going
through
this
cure
having
you
a
full
mekstrom
is
something
that
both
sides
want
so
they
been
willing
to
have
you
cured
so
long
as
someone
does
the
work
huh
right
she
said
seriously
well
then
i
said
with
a
grim
smile
the
obvious
thing
for
me
to
do
is
to
slink
quietly
into
new
washington
and
to
seek
out
some
high
official
in
secrecy
i
put
my
story
and
facts
into
his
hands
make
him
a
mekstrom
have
him
cured
and
then
we
set
up
an
agency
to
provide
the
general
public
with
steve
you
an
engineer
i
presume
you
studied
mathematics
so
let
assume
that
you
can
er
bite
one
person
every
ten
seconds
that
six
persons
per
minute
per
hour
and
ah
per
day
with
one
hundred
and
sixty
million
americans
at
the
last
census
um
sixty
years
without
sleep
i
see
what
you
mean
not
only
that
steve
but
it
would
create
a
panic
if
not
a
global
war
make
an
announcement
like
that
and
certain
of
our
neighbors
would
demand
their
shares
or
else
so
now
add
up
your
time
to
take
care
of
about
three
billion
human
souls
on
this
earth
steve
all
right
so
i
forget
that
cockeyed
notion
but
still
the
government
should
know
if
we
could
be
absolutely
certain
that
every
elected
official
is
a
sensible
honest
man
we
could
said
farrow
the
trouble
is
that
got
enough
demagogues
publicity
hounds
and
to
make
the
secret
impossible
to
keep
i
could
argue
against
that
farrow
was
right
not
only
that
but
government
found
it
hard
enough
to
function
in
this
world
of
rhine
institute
with
honest
secrets
okay
then
i
said
the
only
thing
to
do
is
to
go
back
to
homestead
texas
throw
my
aid
to
the
highways
in
hiding
and
see
what
we
can
do
to
provide
the
earth
with
some
more
sensible
method
of
inoculation
i
obviously
can
not
go
around
biting
people
for
the
rest
of
my
life
i
guess
that
it
steve
i
looked
at
her
i
have
to
borrow
your
car
it
yours
you
be
all
right
she
nodded
eventually
i
be
a
way
station
on
the
highways
i
suppose
can
you
make
it
alone
steve
or
would
you
rather
wait
until
my
parents
are
cured
you
could
still
use
a
telepath
you
know
think
it
safe
for
me
to
wait
it
been
four
months
another
week
or
two
all
right
and
in
the
meantime
i
practice
getting
along
with
this
new
body
of
mine
we
left
it
there
i
roamed
the
house
with
farrow
helping
her
with
her
parents
i
gradually
learned
how
to
control
the
power
of
my
new
muscles
learned
how
to
walk
among
normal
people
without
causing
their
attention
and
one
day
succeeded
in
shaking
hands
with
a
storekeeper
without
giving
away
my
secret
eventually
nurse
farrow
parents
came
out
of
their
treatment
and
we
spent
another
couple
of
days
with
them
we
left
them
too
soon
i
sure
but
they
seemed
willing
that
we
take
off
they
set
up
a
telephone
system
for
getting
supplies
so
that
they
not
have
to
go
into
town
until
they
learned
how
to
handle
their
bodies
properly
and
farrow
admitted
that
there
was
little
more
that
we
could
do
so
we
took
off
because
we
all
knew
that
time
was
running
out
even
though
both
sides
had
left
us
alone
while
i
was
immobilized
both
sides
must
have
a
good
enough
to
predict
my
eventual
cure
in
fact
as
i
think
about
it
now
both
sides
must
have
been
waiting
along
the
outer
edges
of
some
theoretical
area
waiting
for
me
to
emerge
since
they
could
come
plowing
in
without
giving
away
their
purpose
so
we
left
in
farrow
car
and
once
more
hit
the
big
broad
road
we
drove
towards
texas
until
we
came
upon
a
highway
and
then
turned
along
it
looking
for
a
way
station
i
wanted
to
get
in
touch
with
the
highways
i
wanted
close
communication
with
the
harrisons
and
the
rest
of
them
no
matter
what
eventually
we
came
upon
a
sign
with
a
missing
spoke
and
turned
in
the
side
road
wound
in
and
out
leading
us
back
from
the
highway
towards
the
conventional
dead
area
the
house
was
a
white
structure
among
a
light
thicket
of
trees
and
as
we
came
close
to
it
we
met
a
man
busily
tilling
the
soil
with
a
tractor
plow
farrow
stopped
her
car
i
leaned
out
and
started
to
call
but
something
stopped
me
he
is
no
mekstrom
steve
said
farrow
in
a
whisper
but
this
is
a
way
station
according
to
the
road
sign
i
know
but
it
is
according
to
him
he
does
know
any
more
about
mekstrom
disease
than
you
did
before
you
met
catherine
then
what
the
devil
is
wrong
i
do
know
he
perceptive
but
not
too
well
trained
name
william
carroll
let
me
do
the
talking
i
drop
leading
remarks
for
you
to
pick
up
the
man
came
over
amiably
looking
for
someone
he
asked
cheerfully
why
yes
said
gloria
we
sort
of
mildly
acquainted
with
the
mannheims
who
used
to
live
here
sort
of
friends
of
friends
of
theirs
just
dropped
by
to
say
hello
sort
of
she
went
on
covering
up
the
fact
that
she
picked
the
name
of
the
former
occupant
out
of
his
mind
the
mannheims
moved
about
two
months
ago
he
said
sold
the
place
to
us
we
got
a
bargain
do
really
know
of
course
but
the
story
is
that
one
of
them
had
to
move
for
his
health
too
bad
know
where
they
went
no
said
carroll
regretfully
they
seem
to
have
a
lot
of
friends
always
stopping
by
but
i
ca
help
any
so
they
moved
so
fast
that
they
could
even
change
their
highway
sign
i
thought
worriedly
farrow
nodded
at
me
almost
imperceptibly
then
she
said
to
carroll
well
we
wo
keep
you
too
bad
the
mannheims
moved
without
leaving
an
address
yeah
he
said
with
obvious
he
eyed
his
field
and
farrow
started
her
car
we
started
off
and
he
turned
to
go
back
to
his
work
anything
i
asked
no
she
said
but
it
was
a
very
puzzled
voice
nothing
that
i
can
put
a
finger
on
but
what
i
do
know
much
about
real
estate
deals
she
said
i
suppose
that
one
family
could
move
out
and
another
family
move
in
just
in
this
short
a
time
usually
they
do
let
farmlands
lie
fallow
i
pointed
out
if
there
anything
off
color
here
it
the
fact
that
they
changed
their
residence
without
changing
the
highway
sign
unless
i
suggested
brightly
this
is
the
coincidence
maybe
this
sign
is
really
one
that
got
busted
farrow
turned
her
car
into
the
main
highway
and
we
went
along
it
i
could
have
been
right
about
the
spoke
actually
being
broken
instead
of
removed
for
its
directing
purpose
i
hoped
so
in
fact
i
hoped
so
hard
that
i
was
almost
willing
to
forget
the
other
bits
of
evidence
but
then
i
had
to
face
the
truth
because
we
passed
another
highway
sign
and
of
course
its
directional
information
pointed
to
that
farm
the
signs
on
our
side
of
the
highway
were
upside
down
indicating
that
we
were
leaving
the
way
station
the
ones
that
were
posted
on
the
left
hand
side
were
rightside
up
indicating
that
the
drive
was
approaching
a
way
station
that
cinched
it
well
as
i
told
both
farrow
and
me
one
error
does
create
a
trend
let
take
another
look
one
thing
and
another
we
would
either
hit
another
way
station
before
we
got
to
homestead
or
we
would
either
one
could
put
us
wise
so
we
took
off
again
with
determination
and
finally
left
that
side
of
erroneous
highway
signs
when
we
turned
onto
route
we
were
on
route
very
long
because
the
famous
highway
sort
of
trends
to
the
northeast
and
homestead
was
in
a
southern
portion
of
texas
we
left
route
at
amarillo
and
picked
up
which
leads
due
south
not
many
miles
out
of
amarillo
we
came
up
another
set
of
highway
signs
that
pointed
us
on
to
the
south
i
tried
to
remember
whether
this
section
led
to
homestead
by
a
long
route
but
i
had
paid
too
much
attention
to
the
maps
when
i
had
the
chance
and
therefore
the
facts
eluded
me
we
find
out
farrow
and
i
agreed
and
then
before
we
could
think
much
more
about
it
we
came
upon
a
way
station
sign
that
pointed
in
to
another
farmhouse
easy
i
said
you
bet
she
replied
pointing
to
the
mailbox
alongside
the
road
i
nodded
the
box
was
not
new
but
the
lettering
on
the
side
was
still
wet
i
said
with
a
grunt
farrow
slowed
her
car
as
we
approached
the
house
and
i
leaned
out
and
gave
a
cheerful
hail
a
woman
came
out
of
the
front
door
and
waved
at
us
i
trying
to
locate
a
family
named
harrison
i
called
lived
around
here
somewhere
the
woman
looked
thoughtful
she
was
maybe
or
so
clean
but
not
there
was
a
smudge
of
flour
on
her
cheek
and
a
smile
on
her
face
and
she
looked
wholesome
and
honest
why
i
do
really
know
she
said
that
name
sounds
familiar
but
it
is
not
an
uncommon
name
i
know
i
said
uselessly
farrow
nudged
me
on
the
ankle
with
her
toe
and
then
made
a
swift
sign
for
p
in
the
code
why
do
you
come
on
in
invited
the
woman
we
got
an
area
telephone
directory
here
maybe
farrow
nudged
me
once
more
and
made
the
sign
of
m
with
her
swift
fingers
we
had
hit
it
this
time
here
was
a
woman
perceptive
and
a
mekstrom
residing
in
a
way
station
i
took
a
mild
dig
at
her
hands
and
there
was
no
doubt
of
her
a
man
head
appeared
in
the
doorway
above
the
woman
he
had
a
hard
face
and
he
was
tall
and
broad
shouldered
but
there
was
a
smile
on
his
face
that
spread
around
the
pipe
he
was
biting
on
he
called
come
on
in
and
take
a
look
farrow
made
the
sign
of
t
and
m
and
that
told
me
that
he
was
a
telepath
she
had
needed
the
m
sign
because
i
taken
a
fast
glimpse
of
his
hide
as
soon
as
he
appeared
parrying
for
time
and
something
evidential
i
merely
said
no
we
hate
to
intrude
we
were
just
asking
the
man
said
oh
shucks
mister
come
on
in
and
have
a
cup
of
coffee
anyway
his
invitation
was
swift
enough
to
set
me
on
edge
i
turned
my
perception
away
from
him
and
took
a
fast
cast
at
the
surrounding
territory
there
was
a
mildly
dead
area
along
the
road
to
the
left
it
curved
around
in
a
large
arc
and
the
other
horn
of
this
horseshoe
shape
came
up
behind
the
house
and
stopped
abruptly
just
inside
of
their
front
door
the
density
of
this
area
varied
the
end
in
which
the
house
was
built
was
so
total
that
i
could
penetrate
while
the
other
end
that
curved
around
to
end
by
the
road
tapered
off
in
deadness
until
it
was
hard
to
define
the
boundary
if
someone
were
pulling
a
flanking
movement
around
through
that
horseshoe
to
cut
off
our
retreat
it
would
become
evident
very
soon
a
swift
thought
went
through
my
mind
farrow
they
mekstroms
and
he
a
telepath
and
she
a
perceptive
and
they
know
we
friendly
if
they
highways
if
they
connected
with
scholar
phelps
and
his
the
man
repeated
come
on
in
we
some
mail
to
go
to
homestead
that
you
can
take
if
you
will
farrow
made
no
sound
she
just
seesawed
her
car
with
three
rapid
jerks
that
sent
showers
of
stones
from
her
spinning
wheels
we
whined
around
in
a
curve
that
careened
the
car
up
on
its
outside
wheels
then
we
ironed
out
and
showered
the
face
of
the
man
with
stones
from
the
wheels
as
we
took
off
the
shower
of
dust
and
stones
blinded
him
and
kept
him
from
latching
onto
the
tail
of
the
car
and
climbing
in
we
left
him
behind
swearing
and
rubbing
dirt
from
his
eyes
we
whipped
past
the
other
end
of
the
horseshoe
area
just
as
a
jeepster
came
roaring
down
out
of
the
thickened
part
into
the
region
where
my
perception
could
make
out
the
important
things
like
three
burly
gents
wearing
hunting
rifles
for
instance
they
jounced
over
the
rough
ground
and
onto
the
road
just
behind
us
another
few
seconds
of
gab
with
our
friends
and
they
have
been
able
to
cut
us
off
pour
it
on
farrow
i
knew
i
was
a
bit
of
a
cowboy
but
farrow
made
me
look
like
a
tenderfoot
we
rocketed
down
the
winding
road
with
our
wheels
riding
up
on
either
side
like
the
course
in
a
toboggan
run
and
farrow
rode
that
car
like
a
test
pilot
in
a
sudden
thunderstorm
i
was
worried
about
the
hunting
rifles
but
i
need
not
have
been
concerned
we
were
going
too
fast
to
make
good
aim
and
their
jeepster
was
not
a
vehicle
known
for
its
smooth
riding
qualities
they
lost
one
character
over
a
rough
bounce
and
he
went
tail
over
scalp
into
the
grass
along
the
way
he
scared
me
by
leaping
to
his
feet
grabbing
the
rifle
and
throwing
it
up
to
aim
but
before
he
could
squeeze
off
a
round
we
were
out
of
the
road
and
on
the
broad
highway
once
on
the
main
road
again
farrow
put
the
car
hard
down
by
the
nose
and
we
outran
them
the
jeepster
was
a
workhorse
and
could
have
either
pulled
over
the
house
or
climbed
the
wall
and
run
along
the
roof
but
it
was
not
made
for
chase
that
i
said
seems
to
be
that
something
is
bad
agreed
farrow
well
i
doubt
that
they
be
able
to
clean
out
a
place
as
big
as
homestead
so
let
take
our
careful
route
to
homestead
and
find
out
precisely
what
the
devil
is
cooking
know
the
route
no
but
i
know
where
it
is
on
the
map
and
we
can
figure
it
out
from
steve
stop
take
a
very
careful
and
delicate
view
over
to
the
right
digging
for
what
another
car
pacing
us
along
a
road
on
the
other
side
of
that
field
i
tried
and
failed
then
i
leaned
back
in
the
seat
and
closed
my
eyes
and
tried
again
on
this
second
try
i
got
a
very
hazy
perception
of
a
large
moving
mass
that
could
only
have
been
a
car
in
the
car
i
received
a
stronger
impression
of
weapons
it
was
the
latter
that
cinched
it
i
hauled
out
my
roadmap
and
turned
it
to
texas
i
thumbed
the
sectional
maps
of
texas
until
i
located
the
through
which
we
were
passing
and
then
i
identified
this
section
of
precisely
there
was
another
road
parallel
and
a
half
mile
to
the
right
a
dirt
road
according
to
the
it
intersected
our
road
a
few
miles
ahead
my
next
was
a
thorough
covering
of
the
road
behind
as
i
expected
another
car
was
pacing
us
just
beyond
the
range
of
my
perception
for
anything
but
a
rifle
aimed
at
my
hide
pacing
is
quite
the
word
i
use
it
in
the
sense
of
their
keeping
up
with
us
fact
is
that
all
of
us
were
going
about
as
fast
as
we
could
go
with
safety
of
tertiary
importance
anyway
they
were
pacing
us
and
closing
down
from
that
parallel
road
on
the
right
i
took
a
fast
and
very
careful
scanning
of
the
landscape
to
our
left
but
could
find
anything
i
spent
some
time
at
it
then
but
still
came
up
with
a
blank
turn
left
at
that
feeder
road
a
mile
ahead
i
thought
at
farrow
and
she
nodded
there
was
one
possibility
that
i
did
not
like
to
face
we
had
definitely
detected
pursuit
to
our
right
and
behind
but
not
to
our
left
this
did
not
mean
that
the
was
not
covered
it
was
quite
likely
that
the
gang
to
the
rear
were
in
telepathic
touch
with
a
network
of
other
telepaths
the
end
of
which
mental
relay
link
was
far
beyond
range
but
as
close
in
touch
with
our
position
and
action
as
if
we
been
in
sight
the
police
make
nets
that
way
but
the
idea
is
not
exclusive
i
recall
hazing
an
eloping
couple
that
way
once
but
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
take
the
feeder
road
to
the
left
because
the
devil
we
could
see
was
more
dangerous
than
the
devil
we
could
farrow
whipped
into
the
side
road
and
we
tore
along
with
only
a
slight
slowing
of
our
headlong
speed
i
ranged
ahead
worried
suspicious
of
everything
scanning
very
carefully
and
strictly
on
the
watch
for
any
evidence
of
attempted
interception
i
caught
a
touch
of
danger
converging
up
from
the
south
on
a
series
of
small
roads
this
i
did
not
consider
dangerous
after
a
fast
look
at
my
roadmap
because
this
series
of
roads
did
not
meet
our
side
road
for
a
long
time
and
only
after
a
lot
of
turning
and
twisting
so
long
as
we
went
easterly
we
were
okay
from
that
angle
the
gang
behind
of
course
followed
us
staying
at
the
very
edge
of
my
range
you
have
to
fly
farrow
i
told
her
if
that
gang
to
our
south
stays
there
we
not
be
able
to
turn
down
homestead
way
steve
i
holding
this
crate
on
the
road
by
main
force
and
awkwardness
as
it
is
but
she
did
step
it
up
a
bit
at
that
i
kept
a
cautious
and
suspicious
watchout
worrying
in
the
back
of
my
mind
that
someone
among
them
might
turn
up
with
a
jetcopter
so
long
as
the
sky
remained
clear
as
time
went
on
i
perceived
that
the
converging
car
to
the
south
was
losing
ground
because
of
the
convolutions
of
their
road
accordingly
we
turned
to
the
south
making
our
way
around
their
nose
sort
of
and
crossing
their
anticipated
course
to
lead
south
we
hit
to
the
west
of
breckenridge
texas
and
then
farrow
really
poured
on
the
coal
the
idea
was
to
hit
fort
worth
and
lose
them
in
the
city
where
fun
games
and
would
be
viewed
dimly
by
the
peaceloving
citizens
then
we
slope
to
the
south
on
cut
over
to
somewhere
to
the
south
and
take
like
a
cannonball
until
we
turned
off
on
the
familiar
road
to
homestead
fort
worth
was
a
haven
and
a
detriment
to
both
sides
neither
of
us
could
afford
to
run
afoul
of
the
law
so
we
both
cut
down
to
sensible
speeds
and
snaked
our
way
through
the
town
with
farrow
and
me
probing
the
roads
to
the
south
in
hope
of
finding
a
clear
lane
there
were
three
cars
pacing
us
cutting
off
our
retreat
southward
they
hazed
us
forward
to
the
east
like
a
dog
nosing
a
bunch
of
sheep
towards
pappy
barn
then
we
were
out
of
forth
worth
and
on
we
whipped
into
dallas
and
tried
the
same
circumfusion
as
before
and
we
were
as
neatly
barred
so
we
went
out
of
dallas
on
and
as
we
left
the
city
limits
we
poured
on
the
oil
again
hoping
to
get
around
them
so
that
we
could
turn
back
south
towards
homestead
boxed
i
said
looks
like
it
said
farrow
unhappily
i
looked
at
her
she
was
showing
signs
of
weariness
and
i
realized
that
she
been
riding
this
road
for
hours
let
me
take
it
i
said
we
need
your
perception
she
objected
you
ca
drive
and
keep
a
ranging
perception
steve
a
lot
of
good
a
ranging
perception
will
do
once
you
drop
for
lack
of
sleep
and
we
tie
us
up
in
a
ditch
but
we
boxed
i
told
her
we
being
hazed
let
face
it
farrow
they
could
have
surrounded
us
and
glommed
us
any
time
in
the
past
six
hours
why
did
they
she
asked
you
ask
that
because
you
tired
i
said
with
a
grim
smile
any
bunch
that
has
enough
cars
to
throw
a
barrier
along
the
streets
of
cities
like
forth
worth
and
dallas
have
enough
manpower
to
catch
us
if
they
want
to
so
long
as
we
drive
where
they
want
us
to
go
they
cramp
us
down
i
hate
to
admit
it
so
do
i
but
let
swap
farrow
then
you
can
use
your
telepathy
on
them
maybe
and
find
out
what
their
game
is
she
nodded
pulled
the
car
down
to
a
mere
ramble
and
we
swapped
seats
quickly
as
i
let
the
crate
out
again
i
took
one
last
fast
dig
of
the
landscape
and
located
the
cars
that
were
blocking
out
the
passageways
to
the
south
west
and
north
leaving
a
nice
inviting
hole
to
the
way
then
i
had
to
haul
in
my
perception
and
slap
it
along
the
road
ahead
because
i
was
going
to
ramble
far
and
fast
and
see
if
i
could
speed
out
of
the
trailing
horseshoe
and
cut
out
around
the
south
horn
with
enough
leeway
to
double
back
towards
homestead
catch
any
plans
from
them
i
asked
farrow
there
was
no
answer
i
looked
at
her
gloria
farrow
was
in
her
seat
her
eyes
closed
gently
and
her
breath
coming
in
long
pleasant
swells
i
known
she
was
tired
but
i
had
expected
this
absolute
ungluing
a
damned
good
kid
farrow
at
that
last
thought
farrow
moved
slightly
in
her
sleep
and
a
wisp
of
a
smile
crossed
her
lips
briefly
then
she
turned
a
bit
and
snuggled
down
in
the
seat
and
really
hit
the
a
car
came
roaring
at
me
with
flashing
headlamps
and
i
realized
that
dusk
was
coming
i
did
need
the
lights
but
oncoming
drivers
did
so
i
snapped
them
on
the
beams
made
bright
tunnels
in
the
light
and
we
went
along
and
on
and
on
and
on
hour
after
hour
now
and
then
i
caught
a
perceptive
impression
the
crescent
of
cars
that
were
corralling
us
along
and
not
letting
us
off
the
route
i
hauled
out
my
roadmap
and
eyed
the
pages
as
i
drove
by
perception
led
to
louis
and
from
there
due
north
i
had
a
hunch
that
by
the
time
we
played
hide
and
seek
through
louis
and
got
ourselves
hazed
out
to
their
satisfaction
i
be
able
to
give
a
strong
guess
as
to
our
ultimate
destination
i
settled
down
in
my
seat
and
just
drove
still
hoping
to
cut
fast
and
far
around
them
on
my
way
to
homestead
xxiii
three
times
during
the
night
i
tried
to
flip
around
and
cut
my
way
through
their
cordon
and
each
time
i
faced
interception
it
was
evident
that
we
were
being
driven
and
so
long
as
we
went
to
their
satisfaction
they
were
going
to
clobber
us
nurse
farrow
woke
up
along
about
dawn
stretched
and
remarked
that
she
could
use
a
toothbrush
and
a
tub
of
hot
water
and
amusedly
berated
herself
for
not
filling
the
back
seat
before
we
took
off
then
she
became
serious
again
and
asked
for
the
details
of
the
night
which
i
slipped
her
as
fast
as
i
could
we
stopped
long
enough
to
swap
seats
and
i
stretched
out
but
i
sleep
finally
i
said
stop
at
the
next
dog
wagon
farrow
we
going
to
eat
comes
anything
wo
that
be
dangerous
shucks
i
grunted
angrily
they
probably
thank
us
probably
hungry
too
we
find
out
the
smell
of
a
roadside
diner
is
usually
a
bit
on
the
thick
and
greasy
side
but
i
was
so
hungry
that
morning
that
it
smelled
like
kitchen
we
went
in
ordered
coffee
and
orange
juice
and
then
disappeared
into
the
rest
rooms
long
enough
to
clean
up
that
felt
so
good
we
ordered
the
works
and
watched
the
guy
behind
the
fryplate
handle
the
bacon
eggs
and
with
a
deft
efficient
manner
we
pitched
in
fast
hoping
to
beat
the
flies
to
our
breakfast
we
were
so
intent
that
we
paid
no
attention
to
the
car
that
came
into
the
lot
until
a
man
came
in
ordered
coffee
and
a
roll
and
then
carried
it
over
to
our
table
fine
day
for
a
ride
is
it
i
eyed
him
farrow
bristled
and
got
very
tense
i
said
i
doubt
that
i
know
you
friend
quite
likely
but
i
know
you
cornell
i
took
a
fast
dig
there
was
no
sign
of
anything
lethal
except
the
usual
collection
of
tire
irons
screwdrivers
and
other
tools
which
oddly
enough
seldom
come
through
as
being
dangerous
because
they
not
i
not
heeled
cornell
i
just
here
to
save
us
all
some
trouble
telepath
he
nodded
imperceptibly
then
he
said
we
all
save
time
gasoline
and
maybe
getting
into
grief
with
the
cops
if
you
take
route
out
of
st
louis
suppose
i
do
like
get
used
to
it
he
said
with
a
crooked
smile
because
you
take
out
of
louis
whether
you
like
it
or
not
i
returned
his
crooked
smile
i
also
dug
his
hide
and
he
was
a
mekstrom
of
course
friend
i
replied
nothing
would
convince
me
after
what
you
said
that
is
anything
but
a
cowpath
slippery
when
wet
and
impassible
in
the
early
spring
late
summer
and
the
third
thursday
after
michelmas
he
stood
up
cornell
i
can
see
your
point
you
do
like
so
i
help
you
good
people
if
you
do
want
to
drive
along
such
a
lousy
slab
of
concrete
just
say
the
word
and
we
arrange
for
you
to
take
it
in
style
luxury
and
without
a
trace
of
pain
or
strain
i
be
you
and
a
very
pleasant
trip
to
you
miss
farrow
then
the
character
got
up
went
to
the
cashier
and
paid
for
our
breakfast
as
well
as
his
own
he
took
off
in
his
car
and
i
have
never
seen
him
since
farrow
looked
at
me
her
face
white
and
her
whole
attitude
one
of
fright
she
said
in
a
shaky
voice
runs
like
a
stretched
string
from
louis
to
indianapolis
she
did
have
to
tell
me
any
more
about
sixty
miles
north
of
indianapolis
on
indiana
state
highway
lies
the
thriving
metropolis
of
marion
indiana
the
most
important
facet
of
which
to
farrow
and
me
is
an
establishment
called
the
medical
research
center
nothing
was
going
to
make
me
drive
out
of
louis
along
period
end
of
message
no
answer
required
nothing
because
i
was
very
well
aware
of
their
need
to
collect
me
alive
and
kicking
if
i
could
not
roar
out
of
louis
in
the
direction
i
selected
i
was
going
to
turn
my
car
end
for
end
and
have
at
them
not
in
any
mild
manner
but
with
deadly
intent
to
do
deadly
damage
if
make
a
mild
pass
they
undoubtedly
corral
me
by
main
force
and
carry
me
off
kicking
and
screaming
but
if
i
went
at
them
to
kill
or
get
killed
they
have
to
move
aside
just
to
prevent
me
from
killing
myself
i
did
think
i
get
to
the
last
final
blow
of
that
i
win
through
so
we
left
the
diner
after
a
breakfast
on
our
enemy
expense
account
and
took
off
again
i
was
counting
on
louis
the
center
of
the
old
city
is
one
big
shapeless
blob
of
a
dead
area
so
nice
and
cold
that
louis
has
reversed
the
usual
blight
area
growth
ever
since
rhine
the
slum
sections
have
been
moving
out
and
the
new
buildings
have
been
moving
in
so
with
the
dead
area
and
the
wide
streets
and
fancy
traffic
control
louis
was
the
place
to
go
in
along
one
road
get
lost
in
traffic
and
come
out
roaring
along
any
road
desirable
i
could
not
believe
that
any
outfit
hoping
to
work
under
cover
could
collect
enough
manpower
and
cars
to
block
every
road
lane
highway
and
duckrunway
that
led
out
of
a
city
as
big
as
louis
again
they
hazed
us
by
pacing
along
parallel
roads
and
behind
us
with
the
open
end
of
their
crescent
aimed
along
we
went
like
hell
without
slowing
a
bit
we
sort
of
swooped
up
to
louis
and
took
a
fast
dive
into
that
big
dead
area
we
wound
up
in
traffic
and
tied
boy
scout
knots
in
our
course
i
was
concerned
about
overhead
coverage
from
a
even
though
i
been
told
that
the
louis
dead
area
extends
upward
in
some
places
as
high
as
thirteen
thousand
feet
the
only
thing
missing
was
some
device
or
doodad
that
would
let
us
use
our
perception
or
telepathy
in
this
deadness
while
they
could
as
it
was
we
were
as
as
they
were
so
we
had
to
go
along
the
streets
with
our
eyes
carefully
peeled
for
cars
of
questionable
ownership
we
saw
some
passenger
cars
with
licenses
and
gave
them
wide
clearances
one
of
them
hung
on
our
tail
until
i
committed
a
very
neat
coup
by
running
through
a
stoplight
and
sandwiching
my
car
between
two
whopping
big
moving
vans
i
have
enjoyed
the
expression
on
the
driver
face
if
i
could
have
seen
it
but
then
we
were
gone
and
he
was
probably
cussing
i
stayed
between
the
vans
as
we
wound
ourselves
along
the
road
and
turned
into
a
side
street
i
stayed
between
them
too
long
because
the
guy
in
front
slammed
on
his
and
the
big
van
came
to
a
stop
with
a
howl
of
tires
on
concrete
the
guy
behind
did
not
even
slow
down
he
closed
in
on
us
like
an
avalanche
i
took
a
fast
look
around
and
fought
the
wheel
of
my
car
to
turn
aside
but
he
whaled
into
my
tail
and
we
went
sliding
forward
i
was
riding
my
brakes
but
the
mass
of
that
moving
van
was
so
great
that
my
tires
just
wore
flats
on
the
we
were
bearing
down
on
that
stopped
van
and
it
looked
as
though
we
were
going
to
be
driving
a
very
tall
car
with
a
very
short
wheelbase
in
a
very
short
time
then
the
whole
back
panel
of
the
front
van
came
tumbling
towards
me
from
the
top
pivoting
on
a
hinge
at
the
bottom
making
a
fine
ramp
the
van
behind
me
nudged
us
up
the
ramp
and
we
hurtled
forward
against
a
thick
resilient
pad
that
stopped
my
car
without
any
damage
either
to
the
car
or
to
the
inhabitants
then
the
back
panel
closed
up
and
the
van
took
off
two
big
birds
on
each
side
opened
the
doors
of
our
car
simultaneously
and
said
out
the
tall
guy
on
my
side
gave
me
a
cocksure
smile
and
the
short
guy
said
we
about
to
leave
louis
on
cornell
i
hope
you
find
this
journey
too
rough
i
started
to
take
a
swing
but
the
tall
one
caught
my
elbow
and
threw
me
off
balance
the
short
one
reached
down
and
picked
up
a
baseball
bat
use
this
cornell
he
told
me
then
no
one
will
get
hurt
i
looked
at
the
pair
of
them
and
then
gave
up
there
are
odd
characters
in
this
world
who
actually
enjoy
physical
combat
and
do
mind
getting
hurt
if
they
can
hurt
the
other
guy
more
these
were
the
type
taking
that
baseball
bat
and
busting
it
over
the
head
of
either
one
would
be
the
same
sort
of
act
as
kids
use
when
they
square
off
in
an
alley
and
exchange
light
blows
which
they
call
a
cardy
just
to
make
the
fight
legal
all
it
would
get
me
was
a
sore
jaw
and
a
few
cracked
ribs
so
after
my
determination
to
take
after
them
with
murderous
intent
they
pulled
my
teeth
by
scooping
me
up
in
this
van
and
disarming
me
i
relaxed
the
short
one
nodded
although
he
looked
disappointed
that
i
allowed
him
the
fun
of
a
shindy
you
find
less
rough
than
you
expected
he
said
after
all
it
like
life
only
rough
if
you
make
it
rough
go
to
hell
and
stay
there
i
snapped
that
was
about
as
weak
a
rejoinder
as
i
ever
emitted
but
it
was
all
i
could
get
out
the
tall
one
said
take
it
easy
cornell
you
ca
win
all
i
looked
across
the
nose
of
our
trapped
car
to
farrow
she
was
leaning
against
the
hood
facing
her
pair
they
were
just
standing
there
at
ease
one
of
them
was
offering
a
cigarette
and
the
other
held
a
lighter
ready
relax
said
the
one
with
the
smokes
the
other
one
said
might
as
well
miss
farrow
fighting
wo
get
nobody
nowhere
but
where
going
anyway
might
as
well
go
on
your
own
feet
scornfully
farrow
shrugged
why
should
i
smoke
my
own
she
asked
nobody
in
particular
mentally
i
agreed
take
for
all
they
worth
farrow
and
then
i
reached
for
one
too
along
the
side
of
the
van
were
benches
i
sat
down
stretched
out
on
my
back
and
let
the
smoke
trickle
up
i
finished
my
cigarette
and
then
found
that
the
excitement
of
this
chase
having
died
so
abruptly
left
me
with
only
a
desire
to
catch
up
on
sleep
i
dozed
off
thinking
that
it
was
everybody
who
started
off
to
go
to
homestead
texas
and
ended
up
in
marion
indiana
scholar
phelps
did
not
have
the
green
carpet
out
for
our
arrival
but
he
was
present
when
our
mobile
prison
cell
opened
deep
inside
of
the
medical
center
grounds
so
was
thorndyke
thorndyke
and
three
nurses
of
amazon
build
escorted
farrow
off
with
the
air
of
captors
collecting
a
traitor
phelps
smiled
superciliously
at
me
and
said
well
young
sir
given
us
quite
a
chase
give
me
another
chance
and
we
have
another
chase
i
told
him
grumpily
not
if
we
can
help
it
he
boomed
cheerfully
we
big
plans
for
you
have
i
got
a
vote
it
if
i
do
you
too
precipitous
he
told
me
it
is
always
an
error
cornell
to
be
opinionated
have
an
open
mind
to
what
to
everything
he
said
with
an
expansive
gesture
the
error
of
all
thinking
these
days
is
that
people
do
not
think
they
merely
follow
someone
else
thinking
and
i
to
follow
yours
i
prefer
that
of
course
it
would
indicate
that
you
were
possessed
of
a
mind
of
your
own
that
you
were
merely
taking
the
lazy
attitude
and
following
in
the
footsteps
of
your
father
skip
it
i
snapped
your
way
is
now
he
warned
with
a
wave
of
a
forefinger
like
a
prohibitionist
warning
someone
not
to
touch
that
quart
one
must
never
form
an
opinion
on
such
short
notice
remember
all
ideas
are
not
to
be
rejected
just
because
they
do
not
happen
to
agree
with
your
own
preconceived
notions
look
phelps
i
snapped
deliberately
omitting
his
title
which
i
knew
would
bite
a
little
i
do
like
your
personal
politics
and
i
deplore
your
methods
you
ca
go
on
playing
this
way
young
man
you
err
he
said
quietly
he
did
not
even
look
nettled
that
i
addressed
him
in
impolite
if
not
rough
terms
may
i
point
out
that
i
am
far
ahead
of
your
game
thoroughly
outnumbered
and
in
ignorance
of
the
against
me
until
you
so
vigorously
brought
it
to
my
attention
within
a
year
i
have
fought
the
to
a
standstill
caused
the
dispersement
of
their
main
forces
ruined
their
lines
of
communication
and
have
so
consolidated
my
position
that
i
have
now
made
open
capture
of
the
main
roving
factor
the
latter
is
you
young
man
a
very
disturbing
influence
and
so
very
necessary
to
the
conduct
of
this
private
war
you
prate
of
my
attitude
cornell
you
claim
that
such
an
attitude
must
be
defeated
yet
as
you
stand
there
mouthing
platitudes
we
are
preparing
to
make
a
frontal
assault
upon
their
main
base
at
homestead
we
waged
our
war
of
attrition
a
mere
spearhead
will
break
them
and
scatter
them
to
the
far
winds
nice
lecture
i
grunted
who
are
your
writers
let
not
attempt
sarcasm
he
said
crisply
it
sits
ill
upon
you
mr
cornell
i
like
to
sit
on
you
i
snapped
your
humor
is
less
tolerable
than
your
sarcasm
can
it
i
snapped
so
you
collected
me
i
still
you
do
very
little
cornell
he
told
me
your
determination
to
attack
us
tooth
and
nail
was
an
excellent
program
and
with
another
type
of
person
it
might
have
worked
but
i
happen
to
know
that
your
will
to
live
is
very
great
young
man
and
that
in
the
final
blow
you
not
have
the
will
to
die
great
enough
to
carry
your
assault
to
its
completion
know
a
lot
do
you
yes
indeed
i
do
so
now
if
you
through
trying
to
fence
at
words
we
go
to
your
quarters
lead
on
i
said
in
a
hollow
voice
with
an
air
of
politeness
he
indicated
a
door
he
showed
me
out
and
followed
me
he
steered
me
to
a
big
limousine
with
a
chauffeur
and
offered
me
cigarettes
from
a
box
on
the
arm
rest
as
the
driver
started
the
turbine
the
car
purred
with
that
muted
sound
of
power
you
could
be
of
inestimable
value
to
us
he
said
in
a
conversational
tone
i
am
talking
this
way
to
you
because
you
can
be
of
much
more
value
as
a
willing
ally
than
you
would
be
if
unwilling
no
doubt
i
replied
dryly
i
suggest
you
set
aside
your
preconceived
notions
and
employ
a
modicum
of
practical
logic
suggested
scholar
phelps
observe
your
position
from
a
slightly
different
reign
of
vantage
be
convinced
that
no
matter
what
you
do
or
say
we
intend
to
make
use
of
you
to
the
best
of
our
ability
you
are
not
entertaining
any
doubts
of
that
fact
i
sure
i
shrugged
phelps
was
not
asking
me
these
things
the
inquisitor
was
actually
telling
me
he
went
right
on
telling
me
since
you
will
be
used
no
matter
what
you
might
consider
the
advisability
of
being
sensible
cornell
in
blunt
words
we
are
prepared
to
meet
cooperation
with
certain
benefits
which
will
not
be
proffered
otherwise
in
blunter
words
you
are
offering
to
hire
me
scholar
phelps
smiled
in
a
superior
manner
not
that
blunt
cornell
not
that
crude
the
term
implies
the
performance
of
certain
tasks
in
return
for
stipulated
remuneration
no
my
intention
is
to
give
you
a
position
in
this
organization
the
exact
terms
of
which
are
not
clearly
definable
look
young
man
i
indicated
that
your
willing
cooperation
is
more
valuable
to
us
than
otherwise
join
us
and
you
will
enjoy
the
freedom
of
our
most
valued
and
trusted
members
you
will
take
part
in
upper
level
planning
you
will
enjoy
the
income
and
advantages
of
top
executive
personnel
he
stopped
short
and
eyed
me
with
a
peculiar
expression
cornell
you
have
the
most
disconcerting
way
you
actually
caused
me
to
talk
as
if
this
organization
were
some
sort
of
big
business
instead
of
a
cultural
unit
i
eyed
him
with
the
first
bit
of
humor
i
found
in
many
days
you
seem
to
talk
just
as
though
a
cultural
unit
were
set
above
beyond
and
spiritually
divorced
from
anything
so
sordid
as
money
position
and
the
human
equivalent
of
the
barnyard
pecking
order
i
told
him
so
now
let
stop
goofing
off
and
put
it
into
simple
terms
you
want
me
to
join
you
willingly
to
do
your
job
for
you
to
advance
your
program
in
return
for
which
i
shall
be
permitted
to
ride
in
the
solid
gold
cadillac
quaff
rare
champagne
and
select
my
own
office
furniture
is
that
about
it
scholar
phelps
smiled
using
a
benign
expression
that
indicated
that
he
was
pleased
with
himself
but
which
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
his
attitude
towards
me
or
any
of
the
rest
of
the
human
race
cornell
i
am
well
aware
of
the
time
it
may
take
for
a
man
to
effect
a
change
in
his
attitude
in
fact
i
would
be
very
suspicious
if
you
were
to
make
an
abrupt
reversal
however
i
have
outlined
my
position
and
you
may
have
time
to
think
it
over
consider
at
the
very
least
the
fact
that
while
cooperation
will
bring
you
pleasure
and
will
bring
you
pain
the
ultimate
result
will
be
that
we
will
make
use
of
your
ability
in
either
case
now
i
will
say
no
more
for
the
present
the
limousine
had
stopped
in
front
of
a
four
story
brick
building
that
was
only
slightly
different
in
general
architecture
than
others
in
the
medical
center
i
could
sense
some
slight
difference
but
when
i
took
a
dig
at
the
interior
i
found
to
my
amazement
that
this
building
had
been
built
deliberately
in
a
dead
zone
the
dead
area
stood
up
in
the
clarity
like
a
little
blob
of
black
ink
at
the
bottom
of
a
crystal
clear
swimming
pool
seen
just
before
the
ink
began
to
diffuse
scholar
phelps
saw
my
look
of
puzzlement
and
said
suavely
reversed
the
usual
method
of
keeping
unwilling
guests
here
we
know
their
frame
of
mind
and
attitude
therefore
to
build
the
place
in
a
dead
area
keeps
them
from
plotting
among
themselves
i
trust
that
your
residence
herein
will
be
only
temporary
mr
cornell
i
nodded
glumly
i
was
facing
those
last
and
final
words
else
phelps
signed
a
register
at
a
guard
station
in
the
lobby
we
took
a
very
fast
and
efficient
elevator
to
the
third
floor
and
phelps
escorted
me
along
a
hallway
that
was
lined
with
doors
dormitory
style
in
the
center
of
each
door
was
a
bull
eye
that
looked
like
glass
and
undoubtedly
was
i
itched
to
take
a
look
but
phelps
was
not
having
any
he
stopped
my
single
step
with
a
hand
on
my
arm
this
way
he
said
smoothly
i
went
this
way
and
was
finally
shown
into
one
of
the
rooms
my
nice
clean
cell
away
from
home
xxiv
as
soon
as
phelps
was
gone
i
took
a
careful
look
at
my
new
living
quarters
the
room
itself
was
about
fourteen
by
eighteen
but
the
end
in
which
i
was
confined
was
only
fourteen
by
ten
the
other
eight
feet
of
end
being
barred
off
by
a
very
set
of
heavy
metal
rods
and
equally
strong
there
was
a
sliding
door
that
fit
in
place
as
nicely
as
the
door
to
a
bank
vault
it
was
locked
by
heavy
that
slid
up
from
the
floor
and
down
from
the
ceiling
and
they
were
actuated
by
hidden
motors
in
the
barrier
was
a
flat
horizontal
slot
wide
enough
to
take
a
tray
and
high
enough
to
pass
a
teacup
the
bottom
of
this
slot
was
flush
with
a
small
table
that
extended
through
the
barrier
by
a
couple
of
feet
on
both
sides
so
that
a
tray
could
be
set
down
on
the
outside
and
slipped
in
i
tested
the
bars
with
my
hands
but
even
my
new
set
of
muscles
flex
them
more
than
a
few
thousandths
of
an
inch
the
walls
were
steel
all
i
got
as
i
tried
them
was
a
set
of
fingernails
the
floor
was
also
steel
the
ceiling
was
a
bit
too
high
for
me
to
tackle
but
i
assumed
that
it
too
was
steel
the
window
was
barred
from
the
inside
undoubtedly
so
that
any
visitor
from
the
outside
could
not
catch
on
to
the
fact
that
this
building
was
a
private
calaboose
the
er
furnishings
of
this
cold
storage
bin
were
meager
of
minimum
requirements
a
washstand
and
toilet
a
bunk
made
of
metal
girders
welded
to
the
floor
the
bedding
rested
on
wide
resilient
straps
fixed
to
the
at
top
and
bottom
of
the
bed
a
mattress
sheets
and
one
blanket
finished
off
the
bed
it
was
a
cell
designed
by
mekstroms
to
contain
mekstroms
and
by
wiseacres
to
contain
other
wiseacres
the
parts
of
the
room
were
of
course
fireproof
anything
i
could
get
hold
of
was
totally
useless
as
a
weapon
or
lever
or
tool
anything
that
might
have
been
useful
to
a
prisoner
was
welded
down
having
given
up
in
the
escape
department
i
sat
on
my
bunk
and
lit
a
cigarette
i
looked
for
and
found
a
television
lens
set
above
the
door
of
the
room
eight
feet
outside
of
my
steel
barrier
beside
the
lens
was
a
speaker
grille
and
a
smaller
opening
that
looked
like
a
microphone
dust
cover
with
a
grunt
i
flipped
my
cigarette
at
the
television
lens
i
hit
just
above
the
hole
missing
it
by
about
an
inch
immediately
a
voice
said
that
is
not
permitted
cornell
you
are
expected
to
maintain
some
degree
of
personal
cleanliness
since
you
can
not
pick
up
that
cigarette
butt
you
have
placed
an
unwelcome
task
upon
our
personnel
one
more
infraction
of
this
nature
and
you
will
not
be
permitted
the
luxury
of
smoking
go
to
the
devil
i
snapped
there
was
no
reply
not
even
a
haughty
chuckle
the
silence
was
worse
than
any
reply
because
it
pointed
out
the
absolute
superiority
of
their
position
eventually
i
dozed
off
there
being
nothing
else
to
do
when
i
awoke
they
shoved
a
tray
of
food
in
on
my
table
i
ate
unenthusiastically
i
dozed
again
during
which
time
someone
removed
the
tray
when
i
woke
up
the
second
time
it
was
night
and
time
to
go
to
bed
so
i
went
i
woke
up
in
the
morning
to
see
a
burly
guy
enter
with
a
tray
of
breakfast
i
attempted
to
engage
him
in
light
conversation
but
he
did
not
even
let
on
that
i
was
in
the
cell
later
he
removed
the
tray
as
silently
as
brought
it
and
i
was
left
with
another
four
hours
of
utter
boredom
until
the
same
bird
returned
with
a
light
lunch
six
hours
after
lunch
came
a
slightly
more
substantial
dinner
but
no
talk
by
bedtime
the
second
night
i
was
getting
i
hit
the
sack
at
about
nine
thirty
and
tossed
and
turned
unable
to
drop
off
because
i
was
not
actually
tired
i
was
also
wondering
when
they
come
around
with
their
crew
or
maybe
someone
enter
with
an
ultimatum
on
the
following
morning
the
was
thorndyke
who
sat
on
the
chair
on
the
outside
of
my
bars
and
looked
at
me
silently
i
tried
giving
him
stare
for
stare
but
eventually
i
gave
up
and
said
so
now
where
do
we
go
cornell
you
in
a
bad
spot
of
your
own
making
could
be
i
admitted
and
yet
really
you
more
of
a
victim
of
circumstances
forgetting
all
the
sideplay
i
a
prisoner
i
told
him
curtly
face
a
few
facts
thorndyke
and
stop
tossing
this
guff
all
right
he
said
shortly
the
facts
are
these
we
would
prefer
that
you
help
us
willingly
we
further
prefer
to
have
you
as
you
are
that
is
mentally
you
could
afford
to
trust
me
i
grunted
maybe
we
can
it
no
secret
that
we
latched
on
to
quite
a
number
of
your
friends
let
assume
that
they
will
all
be
if
you
agree
to
join
us
willingly
i
sure
that
the
attitude
of
any
of
my
friends
is
such
that
prefer
me
to
stand
my
ground
rather
than
betray
their
notions
of
right
and
wrong
i
told
him
that
a
foolish
premise
he
replied
you
could
no
more
prevail
against
us
than
you
could
overthrow
the
government
having
faced
that
fact
it
becomes
sound
and
sensible
to
accept
the
premise
and
then
see
what
sort
of
niche
you
can
carve
out
of
the
new
order
i
do
like
your
new
order
i
grunted
many
people
will
not
he
admitted
but
then
people
do
not
really
know
what
good
for
them
i
almost
laughed
at
him
look
i
said
i
rather
make
my
own
ignorant
mistakes
than
to
have
some
great
father
supervise
my
life
and
speaking
of
fathers
we
both
got
to
admit
that
god
himself
permits
us
the
complete
freedom
of
our
wills
thorndyke
sneered
at
me
if
we
to
quote
the
scripture
he
said
sourly
i
point
out
that
lord
thy
god
is
a
jealous
god
visiting
his
wrath
even
upon
seven
generations
of
those
who
hate
him
granted
i
replied
calmly
but
whether
we
love
him
or
hate
him
is
entirely
up
to
our
own
particular
notion
now
cornell
stop
talking
like
an
idiot
here
too
you
can
take
your
choice
i
not
ordering
you
i
just
trying
to
point
out
that
whether
you
go
on
suffering
or
enjoying
life
is
entirely
up
to
your
own
decision
and
also
your
decision
will
help
or
hinder
others
you
entirely
too
godlike
i
told
him
well
he
said
think
it
over
go
to
the
devil
now
that
a
very
weak
response
he
said
loftily
doing
nobody
any
good
or
harm
just
talk
so
stop
gabbing
and
think
thorndyke
left
me
with
my
thoughts
sure
i
had
bargaining
power
but
it
was
no
good
i
be
useful
only
until
they
discovered
some
method
of
inoculating
normal
flesh
with
mekstrom
disease
and
once
that
was
taken
care
of
steve
cornell
would
be
a
burden
upon
their
resources
so
that
was
the
morning
of
my
third
day
of
incarceration
and
nothing
more
took
place
all
day
they
did
even
give
me
anything
to
read
and
i
almost
went
nuts
you
have
no
idea
of
how
long
fourteen
hours
can
be
until
you
been
sitting
in
a
cell
with
absolutely
nothing
to
do
i
exercised
by
chinning
myself
on
the
bars
and
playing
gymnastics
i
wanted
to
run
but
there
was
not
enough
room
the
physical
thrill
i
got
out
of
being
able
to
chin
myself
with
one
hand
wore
off
after
a
half
hundred
because
it
was
no
great
feat
for
a
mekstrom
i
did
and
bridges
and
other
stunts
until
i
was
bored
again
and
all
the
while
my
thinking
section
was
going
around
and
around
the
one
main
point
that
i
kept
coming
back
to
was
a
very
unpleasant
future
to
face
it
was
certain
that
no
matter
what
i
did
nor
how
i
argued
i
was
going
to
help
them
out
either
i
would
do
it
willingly
or
they
grow
tired
of
the
lecture
routine
and
take
me
in
for
a
mental
after
which
being
cornell
any
more
i
join
their
ranks
and
do
their
bidding
about
the
only
thing
i
could
look
at
with
was
my
determination
to
hold
out
if
i
was
going
to
join
them
it
would
be
after
i
were
no
longer
the
man
i
am
but
reoriented
into
whatever
design
they
wanted
and
that
resolve
was
weakened
by
the
normal
human
will
to
live
you
ca
make
a
horse
drink
water
but
you
can
lead
a
human
being
to
a
well
and
he
will
drink
it
dry
if
you
keep
a
shotgun
pointed
in
his
direction
and
so
it
ended
up
with
my
always
wondering
if
when
the
cards
were
all
dealt
out
face
up
whether
i
would
have
the
guts
to
keep
on
saying
right
up
to
the
point
where
i
walked
into
their
department
of
in
fact
i
was
rather
afraid
that
in
the
last
moment
weaken
just
to
stay
being
me
that
uncertainty
of
mine
was
of
course
just
the
idea
they
wanted
to
nourish
in
my
mind
they
were
doing
it
by
leaving
me
alone
with
my
mental
again
i
hit
the
sack
out
of
sheer
boredom
and
i
turned
and
tossed
for
what
seemed
like
hours
before
i
dropped
off
to
sleep
wondering
and
dreaming
about
who
was
to
be
the
next
visitor
with
a
bill
of
goods
to
sell
the
next
visitor
came
in
about
midnight
or
thereabouts
i
woke
up
with
the
realization
that
someone
had
come
in
through
the
outer
door
and
was
standing
there
in
the
caused
by
a
bright
moon
shining
in
through
my
barred
window
steve
she
said
in
a
near
whisper
go
away
i
told
her
have
you
done
enough
already
oh
please
steve
i
got
to
talk
to
you
i
sat
on
the
edge
of
my
bunk
and
looked
at
her
she
was
fully
dressed
her
light
printed
silk
was
of
the
same
general
pattern
and
fit
that
she
preferred
in
fact
catherine
looked
as
i
always
seen
her
and
as
pictured
her
during
the
long
hopeless
weeks
of
our
separation
you
got
something
to
add
i
asked
her
coldly
i
got
to
make
you
understand
steve
she
pleaded
understand
what
i
snapped
i
know
already
you
deliberately
set
out
to
marry
or
tie
some
emotional
cable
onto
me
god
knows
that
you
succeeded
if
it
had
been
for
that
accident
i
have
been
nailed
down
tight
that
part
is
true
she
whispered
naturally
you
got
justification
well
i
have
so
has
any
burglar
she
shook
her
head
at
me
steve
you
do
really
understand
if
only
you
could
read
my
mind
and
know
the
truth
she
let
this
trail
off
in
a
helpless
awkwardness
it
was
one
of
those
statements
that
are
meaningless
because
it
can
be
said
by
either
friend
or
foe
and
can
not
be
checked
i
just
looked
at
her
and
suddenly
remembered
something
this
was
the
first
time
in
my
life
that
i
was
in
a
position
to
do
some
verbal
fencing
with
a
telepath
on
even
terms
i
could
say
and
think
with
absolute
impunity
in
fact
i
might
even
have
had
an
edge
since
as
a
poor
i
did
have
some
training
in
subterfuge
falsehood
and
diplomatic
maneuver
that
the
telepath
could
have
catherine
and
i
at
long
last
were
in
the
position
of
the
good
old
days
when
boys
and
girls
could
really
know
the
truth
about
one
another
real
thoughts
so
what
this
truth
i
demanded
steve
answer
me
truly
have
you
ever
been
put
on
an
odious
job
only
to
find
that
the
job
is
really
pleasant
yes
then
hear
me
out
i
in
fact
no
woman
takes
kindly
to
being
directed
to
do
what
i
did
i
was
told
to
meet
you
to
marry
her
face
looked
flustered
and
it
might
have
been
a
bit
flushed
for
all
i
knew
i
could
see
color
enough
in
the
dim
light
to
be
and
then
i
met
you
steve
and
i
found
out
that
you
were
really
a
very
nice
sort
of
guy
well
thanks
do
be
bitter
hear
the
truth
if
otto
mekstrom
had
not
existed
if
there
were
no
such
thing
as
mekstrom
disease
and
i
had
met
you
freely
and
openly
as
men
and
women
meet
i
have
come
to
feel
the
same
steve
i
must
make
you
understand
that
my
emotional
attachment
to
you
was
not
increased
nor
decreased
by
the
fact
that
my
physical
actions
were
directed
at
you
if
anything
my
job
was
just
rendered
pleasantly
easier
i
grunted
and
so
you
were
made
happy
yes
she
whispered
and
i
was
going
to
marry
you
and
live
honestly
with
you
heck
of
a
marriage
with
the
wife
in
the
medical
center
for
disease
and
our
first
child
steve
you
poor
fool
do
you
understand
if
our
child
came
as
predicted
the
first
thing
i
do
would
be
to
have
the
child
inoculate
the
father
then
we
be
um
i
grunted
i
had
thought
of
that
this
was
a
flat
lie
considered
it
since
my
jailing
here
present
the
medical
center
with
a
child
a
mekstrom
and
a
carrier
and
good
old
pappy
would
be
no
longer
needed
well
after
i
found
out
all
about
you
steve
that
what
i
had
in
mind
but
now
now
what
i
urged
her
gently
i
had
a
hunch
that
she
was
leading
up
to
something
but
ducking
shy
about
it
until
she
managed
to
find
out
how
i
thought
it
would
have
been
all
zero
if
we
been
in
a
clear
area
but
as
it
was
i
led
her
gently
on
but
now
i
failed
she
said
with
a
slight
wail
what
do
they
do
with
failures
i
asked
harshly
siberia
or
a
gunny
sack
weighted
down
with
an
anvil
or
do
they
drum
you
out
of
the
corps
i
do
know
i
eyed
her
closely
i
was
forced
to
admit
that
no
matter
how
catherine
thought
she
was
a
mighty
attractive
dish
from
the
physical
standpoint
and
regardless
of
the
trouble
she
put
me
through
i
could
not
overlook
the
fact
that
i
had
been
deep
enough
in
love
to
plan
elopement
and
marriage
i
held
her
slender
body
close
and
either
her
response
had
been
honestly
warm
or
catherine
was
an
actress
of
very
rare
physical
ability
scholar
phelps
could
hardly
have
picked
a
warmer
temptress
in
the
first
place
putting
her
onto
me
now
was
a
stroke
of
i
got
up
from
the
edge
of
my
bunk
and
faced
her
through
my
bars
she
came
close
too
and
we
looked
into
each
other
faces
over
a
of
the
heavy
fence
i
managed
a
wistful
grin
at
her
you
not
really
a
failure
yet
are
you
kid
i
do
quite
know
how
to
to
she
replied
i
looked
around
my
little
cell
with
a
gruesome
gesture
this
is
my
idea
of
a
pleasant
home
and
yet
it
will
be
my
home
until
someone
decides
that
i
too
expensive
to
keep
i
know
she
breathed
taking
the
bit
in
my
teeth
i
said
catherine
even
though
well
heck
i
like
to
help
you
you
mean
that
she
asked
in
almost
an
eager
voice
it
not
impossible
to
forget
that
we
were
eloping
when
all
this
started
it
all
seems
so
long
ago
she
said
with
a
thick
voice
and
i
wish
we
were
back
there
no
steve
i
wish
mekstrom
disease
had
never
happened
i
wish
stop
wishing
and
think
i
told
her
if
there
were
no
mekstrom
disease
the
chances
are
that
we
never
have
met
in
the
first
place
that
the
cruel
part
of
it
all
she
cried
and
i
mean
i
rapped
on
the
metal
bars
with
a
fist
so
here
we
are
i
said
unhappily
i
ca
help
you
now
catherine
she
put
her
hands
through
the
bars
and
held
my
face
between
them
she
looked
searching
into
my
eyes
as
if
straining
to
force
her
blocked
telepath
sense
through
the
deadness
of
the
area
she
leaned
against
the
steel
but
the
barrier
was
very
effective
our
lips
met
through
the
cold
metal
it
was
a
very
unsatisfactory
kiss
because
we
had
to
purse
our
lips
like
a
pair
of
piccolo
players
to
make
them
meet
it
was
like
making
love
through
a
keyhole
this
unsatisfactory
lovemaking
did
not
last
long
unsteadily
catherine
said
i
want
you
steve
inwardly
i
grinned
and
then
with
the
same
feeling
as
if
i
laughed
out
loud
at
a
funeral
i
said
through
these
steel
bars
she
brought
out
a
little
cylindrical
key
then
went
to
a
brass
wall
plate
beside
the
outer
door
inserted
the
key
and
turned
the
sliding
door
to
my
cell
opened
on
noiseless
machined
slides
then
with
a
careful
look
at
me
catherine
slipped
a
little
shutter
over
the
glass
bull
eye
in
the
door
her
hand
reached
up
to
a
hidden
toggle
above
the
door
and
as
she
snapped
it
a
thick
cover
surged
out
above
the
speaker
television
lens
and
microphone
grille
curved
down
and
shut
off
the
with
a
cushioned
sound
apparently
the
top
management
of
the
joint
used
these
cells
for
other
things
than
mere
containment
of
unruly
prisoners
i
almost
grinned
the
society
that
scholar
phelps
proposed
was
not
the
kind
that
flourished
in
an
atmosphere
of
trust
or
privacy
except
for
the
top
brass
catherine
turned
from
her
switch
plate
and
came
across
the
floor
with
her
face
lifted
and
her
lips
parted
hold
me
steve
my
hand
came
forward
in
a
short
jab
that
caught
her
dead
center
in
the
plexus
below
the
ribs
her
breath
caught
in
one
strangled
gasp
and
her
eyes
went
glassy
she
swayed
stiffly
in
my
other
hand
came
up
closing
as
it
rose
until
it
became
a
fist
that
connected
in
a
wallop
on
the
side
of
her
jaw
her
head
snapped
up
and
her
knees
caved
in
she
folded
from
the
hips
and
went
down
bonelessly
from
her
throat
came
the
bubbly
sound
of
air
being
forced
painfully
through
a
flaccid
wet
tube
i
jumped
outside
of
the
cell
barrier
because
i
was
certain
that
they
had
some
means
of
closing
the
cell
from
a
master
control
center
i
know
much
about
penology
but
that
the
way
i
do
it
i
was
that
i
been
able
to
get
away
with
this
much
catherine
stirred
and
moaned
and
i
stopped
long
enough
to
take
the
key
out
of
the
wall
plate
the
cell
door
closed
on
its
silent
slides
i
had
hardly
been
able
to
more
than
run
the
zipper
up
my
shirt
when
the
door
opened
and
i
had
to
dance
like
a
fool
to
get
behind
it
the
door
admitted
a
flood
of
bright
light
from
the
corridor
and
james
thorndyke
the
cell
door
must
have
been
bugged
thorndyke
came
in
behind
a
large
automatic
clutched
in
one
nervous
fist
he
strained
his
eyes
at
the
gloom
that
was
not
cut
by
the
ribbon
of
light
and
then
i
cut
him
down
with
a
solid
slice
of
my
right
hand
to
the
base
of
his
neck
i
remembered
to
jump
off
the
ground
as
the
blow
went
home
there
was
a
sickening
crunch
of
bone
and
muscle
as
thorndyke
caved
forward
to
the
floor
he
dropped
the
gun
luckily
as
his
body
began
to
twitch
and
kick
spasmodically
as
the
life
drained
out
of
him
i
a
mouthful
of
bitter
bile
as
i
reached
down
to
pick
up
his
gun
then
the
room
got
hot
and
unbearably
small
and
i
felt
a
frantic
urge
to
leave
to
close
the
door
upon
that
sight
xxv
i
was
yards
away
from
my
door
before
my
panic
left
me
then
i
remembered
where
and
who
i
was
and
took
a
fast
look
around
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
corridor
of
course
or
i
would
not
have
been
able
to
cut
and
run
as
i
had
but
i
looked
around
anyway
until
my
reasoning
power
told
me
that
i
had
done
little
to
help
my
position
like
the
canary
my
plans
for
escape
ended
once
i
was
outside
of
my
cage
i
literally
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
my
freedom
one
thing
was
becoming
painfully
obvious
i
be
pinned
down
tight
once
i
put
a
foot
outside
of
the
dead
area
in
which
this
building
was
constructed
what
i
needed
was
friends
arms
ammunition
and
a
good
solid
plan
of
escape
i
had
neither
unless
you
call
my
jailed
friends
such
help
and
there
i
could
not
go
the
would
give
me
away
to
the
master
control
center
before
i
could
raise
my
small
and
unarmed
army
so
i
stood
there
in
the
brightly
lighted
corridor
and
tried
to
think
i
got
nowhere
but
i
was
driven
to
action
again
by
the
unmistakable
sound
of
the
elevator
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
i
eyed
the
various
cell
doors
with
suspicion
opening
any
but
an
empty
room
would
cause
some
comment
from
the
occupant
which
again
would
give
me
away
nor
did
i
have
time
to
canvass
the
joint
by
peeking
into
the
bull
eyes
peering
into
a
to
see
which
room
was
empty
so
instead
of
hiding
in
the
corridor
i
sloped
towards
the
elevator
and
the
stairwell
that
surrounded
it
hoping
that
i
could
make
it
before
the
elevator
rose
to
my
floor
i
know
that
my
passage
must
have
sounded
like
a
turbojet
in
full
flight
but
i
made
the
stairway
and
took
a
headlong
leap
down
the
first
short
flight
of
stairs
just
as
the
elevator
door
rolled
open
i
hit
the
wall
with
a
bumping
crash
that
jarred
my
senses
but
i
kept
my
feet
and
looked
back
up
the
stairs
i
caught
a
flash
of
motion
a
guard
sauntering
past
the
top
of
the
well
a
cigarette
in
one
hand
and
a
air
about
him
he
was
expecting
no
trouble
and
so
i
gave
him
none
i
crept
up
the
stairs
and
poked
my
head
out
just
at
the
floor
level
the
guard
obviously
confident
that
nothing
but
nothing
could
ever
happen
in
this
welded
metal
crib
jauntily
peered
into
a
couple
of
the
rooms
at
random
took
a
long
squint
at
the
room
i
recently
vacated
and
then
went
on
to
the
end
of
the
hall
where
he
stuck
a
key
in
a
on
his
way
back
he
paused
again
to
peer
into
my
room
straining
to
see
if
he
could
peer
past
the
little
shutter
over
the
bull
eye
then
he
shrugged
unhappily
and
started
to
return
i
loped
down
the
stairs
to
the
second
floor
and
waited
the
elevator
came
down
stopped
and
the
guard
repeated
his
desultory
search
not
stopping
to
pry
into
any
darkened
rooms
just
above
the
final
flight
i
stopped
and
sprawled
on
the
floor
with
only
my
head
and
the
nose
of
my
gun
over
the
top
step
below
was
the
guard
desk
and
standing
beside
the
desk
with
anger
in
every
line
of
his
ugly
face
was
scholar
phelps
the
elevator
came
down
stopped
and
the
guard
walked
out
to
be
nailed
by
phelps
your
job
snapped
the
good
scholar
coldly
says
you
are
to
walk
well
er
sir
it
walk
stormed
phelps
angrily
you
ca
cover
that
stairway
in
the
elevator
you
fumbling
idiot
but
sir
someone
could
easily
come
down
while
you
go
up
i
know
that
sir
but
then
why
do
you
disobey
roared
phelps
well
you
see
sir
i
know
how
this
place
is
built
and
no
one
has
ever
made
it
yet
who
could
the
guard
looked
mystified
phelps
had
to
face
that
fact
he
did
not
accept
it
gracefully
my
orders
are
orders
he
said
stiffly
you
follow
them
to
the
last
letter
yes
sir
i
will
see
that
you
do
now
i
going
up
i
ride
and
you
walk
meet
me
on
the
fourth
and
bring
the
elevator
down
with
you
yessir
i
sloped
upstairs
like
a
scared
rabbit
up
to
the
third
again
where
i
moved
down
the
corridor
and
slipped
into
the
niche
made
by
a
door
stolidly
the
guard
came
up
the
stairs
crossed
in
front
of
the
elevator
with
his
back
to
me
turned
the
far
corner
and
went
on
up
to
the
fourth
as
his
feet
started
up
the
stairs
i
was
behind
him
by
the
time
he
reached
the
top
i
was
half
way
up
phelps
said
now
from
this
moment
on
waldron
you
follow
every
order
to
the
absolute
letter
and
when
i
ring
do
make
the
error
of
bringing
the
elevator
send
it
it
come
up
and
stop
without
a
pilot
yes
sir
i
sorry
sir
but
you
understand
sir
there
is
really
much
to
guard
sir
then
guard
nothing
but
guard
it
well
because
a
man
in
your
position
is
gauged
in
success
by
the
amount
of
boredom
he
creates
for
himself
the
guard
started
down
and
i
darted
up
to
poke
my
head
out
to
see
where
phelps
was
going
as
i
neared
the
floor
level
i
had
a
shock
like
someone
hurling
twenty
gallons
of
ice
water
in
my
face
the
top
floor
was
the
end
of
the
dead
area
and
i
pulled
my
head
down
into
the
murk
like
a
diver
taking
a
plunge
so
i
stood
there
making
like
a
guppy
with
my
head
sounding
out
the
boundary
of
that
deadness
ducking
down
as
soon
as
the
mental
murk
gave
me
a
faint
perception
of
the
wall
and
ceiling
above
me
then
i
move
aside
and
sound
it
again
eventually
i
found
a
little
billowing
furrow
that
rose
above
the
floor
level
and
i
crawled
out
along
the
floor
still
sounding
and
moving
cautiously
with
my
body
hidden
in
the
deadness
that
rose
and
fell
like
a
cloud
of
murky
mental
smoke
to
my
sense
of
perception
i
would
have
looked
silly
to
any
witness
wallowing
along
the
floor
like
a
porpoise
acting
furtive
in
the
bright
lights
but
then
i
could
go
any
farther
the
deadness
sank
below
the
floor
level
and
left
me
looking
along
a
bare
floor
that
was
also
bare
to
my
sense
of
perception
i
shoved
my
head
out
of
the
dead
zone
and
took
a
fast
dig
then
dropped
back
in
again
and
lay
there
what
i
perceived
mentally
i
did
it
the
second
time
and
the
third
each
time
making
a
rapid
scan
of
some
portion
of
that
fourth
floor
in
three
fast
swings
i
collected
a
couple
of
empty
offices
a
very
complete
hospital
operating
room
and
a
place
that
looked
like
a
consultation
theatre
on
my
fourth
scan
i
whipped
past
scholar
phelps
who
was
apparently
deep
in
some
personal
interest
i
rose
at
once
and
strode
down
the
hall
and
snapped
the
door
open
just
as
phelps
completely
unexpecting
mind
grasped
the
perceptive
fact
that
someone
was
coming
down
his
hallway
wearing
a
great
big
forty
five
automatic
freeze
i
snapped
put
that
weapon
down
cornell
it
nor
its
use
will
get
your
freedom
maybe
all
i
want
out
of
life
is
to
see
you
leave
it
i
told
him
you
not
be
that
foolish
i
sure
he
said
i
might
he
laughed
with
all
the
in
the
world
cornell
you
have
too
much
will
to
live
you
not
the
martyr
type
i
might
turn
out
to
be
the
type
i
told
him
seriously
so
play
it
cagey
phelps
scholar
phelps
please
i
would
disgrace
the
medical
profession
i
told
him
so
so
what
do
you
propose
to
do
about
this
i
getting
out
do
be
ridiculous
one
step
out
of
this
building
and
you
return
within
a
half
minute
how
did
you
get
out
i
was
seduced
out
now
i
advise
you
to
surrender
to
stop
this
hopeless
attempt
to
put
that
weapon
down
you
can
not
escape
there
are
in
this
building
your
mental
and
intellectual
superiors
whose
incarceration
bear
me
witness
i
eyed
him
coldly
and
quietly
i
not
convinced
i
out
and
if
you
could
take
a
dig
below
you
see
a
dead
man
and
an
unconscious
woman
to
bear
me
witness
i
broke
your
thorndyke
neck
with
a
chop
of
my
bare
hand
phelps
i
knocked
catherine
cold
with
a
fist
this
thing
might
not
kill
you
but
i
a
mekstrom
too
and
so
help
me
i
can
cool
you
down
but
good
violence
will
get
you
nothing
try
my
patience
i
bet
my
worthless
hide
on
it
then
i
grinned
at
him
oh
it
is
so
worthless
is
it
one
cry
from
me
cornell
and
and
you
not
live
to
see
what
happens
i
killed
once
tonight
i
did
like
it
but
the
idea
is
not
as
new
now
as
it
was
then
i
kill
you
phelps
if
for
no
other
reason
than
merely
to
keep
my
word
with
a
sneer
phelps
turned
to
his
desk
and
i
stabbed
my
perception
behind
the
papers
and
stuff
to
the
call
button
then
i
launched
myself
across
the
room
like
a
rocket
swinging
my
gun
hand
as
i
soared
the
steel
caught
him
on
the
side
of
the
head
and
drove
him
back
from
his
call
button
before
his
finger
could
press
it
then
i
let
him
have
a
fist
in
the
belly
because
the
pistol
swat
had
much
more
than
dazed
him
the
fist
did
it
he
crumpled
in
a
heap
and
fought
for
breath
unconsciously
i
turned
to
the
wall
he
been
eyeing
with
so
much
attention
there
was
row
upon
row
of
small
kine
tubes
each
showing
the
dark
interior
of
a
cell
below
each
was
a
row
of
pilot
lights
all
dark
on
his
desk
was
a
large
bank
of
push
buttons
a
speaker
and
a
microphone
and
beside
the
push
button
was
a
ledger
containing
a
list
of
names
with
their
cell
numbers
i
found
marian
harrison
pushed
her
button
and
heard
her
ladylike
snore
from
the
speaker
a
green
lamp
winked
under
one
of
the
kine
tubes
and
i
walked
over
and
looked
into
the
darkened
cell
to
see
her
familiar
hair
sprawled
over
a
thick
pillow
i
went
to
the
desk
and
snapped
on
the
microphone
marian
i
said
marian
hey
marian
harrison
in
the
picture
tube
there
was
a
stir
then
she
sat
up
and
looked
around
in
a
sort
of
daze
marian
this
is
steve
cornell
but
do
steve
cry
out
i
finished
uselessly
where
are
you
she
asked
in
a
whisper
i
in
the
con
room
but
how
on
earth
no
time
to
gab
i
be
down
in
a
rush
with
the
key
get
dressed
yes
steve
i
took
off
in
a
headlong
rush
with
the
register
in
one
hand
i
made
the
third
floor
and
marian
cell
in
slightly
more
than
nothing
flat
but
she
was
ready
when
i
came
barging
into
her
room
she
was
out
of
the
cell
before
it
hit
the
backstop
and
following
me
down
the
hall
towards
her
brother
room
what
happened
she
asked
breathlessly
later
i
told
her
i
opened
phillip
harrison
cell
you
go
wake
up
fred
macklin
and
tell
him
to
come
here
then
get
the
macklin
girl
alice
it
says
here
and
the
pair
of
you
wake
up
others
and
start
sending
up
stairs
i
call
you
on
the
telltale
as
soon
as
i
can
marian
took
off
with
the
key
and
the
register
and
i
started
to
shake
phillip
harrison
shoulder
wake
up
i
cried
wake
up
phillip
phillip
made
a
noise
like
a
baby
seal
wake
up
wha
it
steve
cornell
wake
up
with
a
rough
shake
of
his
head
phillip
groaned
and
unwound
himself
out
of
a
tangle
of
bedclothing
he
looked
at
me
through
glassy
eyes
then
he
straightened
and
made
a
perilous
course
to
the
washstand
where
he
sopped
a
towel
in
cold
water
and
applied
it
to
his
face
neck
and
shoulders
when
he
dropped
the
towel
in
the
sink
his
expression
was
fresher
and
his
eyes
were
mingled
curiosity
and
amazement
what
gives
he
asked
starting
to
dress
in
a
hurry
i
busted
out
slugged
scholar
phelps
and
took
over
the
master
control
room
i
need
help
we
ca
keep
it
long
unless
we
move
fast
yeah
man
any
moving
will
be
fast
he
said
sourly
got
any
plans
we
the
door
opened
to
let
fred
macklin
enter
he
carried
his
shirt
and
had
been
dressing
on
the
run
what
goes
on
he
asked
look
i
said
quickly
if
i
have
to
stop
and
give
anybody
a
rundown
we
have
no
time
to
do
what
has
to
be
done
there
are
a
couple
of
sources
of
danger
one
is
the
guard
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairway
the
other
is
the
possible
visitor
you
get
a
couple
of
other
young
ambitious
fellows
and
push
that
guard
post
over
but
quick
right
and
you
i
got
to
keep
our
hostage
cold
i
snapped
and
i
running
the
show
by
virtue
of
being
the
guy
that
managed
to
bust
loose
in
the
hallway
there
was
movement
but
i
left
it
to
head
back
to
scholar
phelps
i
got
there
in
time
to
hear
him
groan
and
make
scratching
noises
on
the
carpet
i
took
no
chances
i
cooled
him
down
with
a
short
jab
to
the
pit
of
the
stomach
and
doubled
him
over
again
he
was
sleeping
painfully
but
soundlessly
when
marian
came
in
i
turned
to
her
you
supposed
to
be
waking
up
i
gave
the
key
and
the
register
to
jo
anne
tweedy
she
said
jo
anne
the
brash
young
teenager
you
took
a
bump
with
in
ohio
competent
steve
and
she
got
the
macklin
twins
to
help
her
waking
up
the
camp
is
a
job
for
the
junior
division
she
eyed
the
recumbent
phelps
distastefully
what
have
you
in
mind
for
him
he
valuable
i
said
we
use
him
to
buy
our
freedom
the
door
opened
again
interrupting
marian
it
was
jonas
harrison
he
stood
there
in
the
frame
of
the
door
and
looked
at
us
with
a
sort
of
grim
smile
i
had
never
met
the
old
patriarch
of
the
harrison
family
before
but
he
lived
up
to
my
every
expectation
he
stood
tall
and
straight
topped
by
a
wealth
of
snow
white
hair
white
eyebrows
and
the
touch
of
a
white
moustache
his
eyes
contrasted
with
the
white
a
rich
and
startling
brown
this
was
a
man
to
whom
i
could
hand
the
basic
problem
of
engineering
our
final
escape
jonas
harrison
was
capable
of
plotting
an
airtight
getaway
his
voice
was
rich
and
resonant
it
had
a
lift
in
its
tone
that
sounded
as
though
his
had
never
been
in
danger
of
a
well
son
you
seem
to
have
accomplished
quite
a
job
this
night
what
shall
we
do
next
get
the
devil
out
of
here
i
replied
wondering
just
exactly
how
i
known
so
instantly
that
this
was
jonas
harrison
the
rich
and
resonant
voice
had
flicked
a
subsurface
recollection
on
a
faint
raw
spot
and
now
something
important
was
swimming
around
in
the
mire
of
my
mind
trying
to
break
loose
and
come
clear
i
turned
from
the
brown
eyes
and
looked
at
marian
she
was
almost
as
i
had
first
seen
her
not
much
if
any
at
all
her
hair
free
of
fancy
dressing
but
neat
her
legs
were
bare
and
i
looked
at
her
and
for
a
half
dozen
heartbeats
her
image
faded
from
my
sight
replaced
by
the
well
remembered
figure
of
catherine
as
i
had
known
her
first
it
was
a
montage
because
my
perception
senses
the
real
figure
of
marian
superimposed
on
the
visual
of
catherine
then
the
false
sight
faded
and
both
perception
and
eyesight
focused
upon
the
true
person
of
marian
harrison
marian
stood
there
her
face
softly
proud
her
eyes
were
looking
straight
into
mine
as
if
she
were
mentally
urging
me
to
fight
that
hidden
memory
into
full
recollection
then
i
both
saw
and
perceived
something
that
i
had
never
noticed
before
a
fine
golden
chain
hung
around
her
throat
its
pendant
hidden
from
sight
beneath
the
edge
of
her
bodice
but
my
sense
of
perception
dug
a
modest
diamond
and
i
could
even
dig
the
tiny
initials
engraved
in
the
metal
circlet
to
dig
anything
that
fine
i
knew
that
it
must
be
of
importance
to
me
and
then
i
knew
that
it
had
once
been
so
very
personally
my
own
business
for
the
submerged
recollection
came
bursting
up
to
the
top
of
my
mind
marian
henderson
had
been
mine
once
long
ago
boldly
i
stepped
forward
and
took
the
chain
between
my
fingers
i
snapped
it
and
held
the
ring
will
you
wear
it
again
my
dear
she
held
up
her
left
hand
for
me
to
slip
it
on
steve
she
breathed
i
never
stopped
wearing
it
not
really
but
i
did
see
it
until
now
jonas
harrison
said
no
steve
you
could
see
it
until
you
remembered
but
look
blame
me
he
said
in
his
firm
determined
voice
the
story
begins
and
ends
with
you
steve
when
marian
contracted
mekstrom
disease
she
herself
insisted
that
you
be
spared
the
emotional
pain
that
the
rest
of
us
could
not
avoid
so
i
erased
her
from
your
mind
steve
and
submerged
any
former
association
then
when
the
highways
in
hiding
came
to
take
us
in
i
left
it
that
way
because
marian
was
still
as
unattainable
to
you
as
if
she
were
dead
if
an
apology
is
needed
i
only
ask
that
you
forgive
my
tampering
with
your
mind
and
personality
apologize
i
exploded
i
here
we
here
and
you
just
provided
me
with
a
way
out
of
this
mousetrap
a
way
out
he
murmured
in
that
absent
way
that
telepaths
have
when
they
concentrating
on
another
mind
fast
comprehension
dawned
in
the
sharp
brown
eyes
and
he
looked
even
more
and
determined
marian
leaned
back
in
my
arms
to
look
into
my
eyes
steve
she
cried
it
simply
got
to
work
gloria
farrow
merely
said
he
have
to
have
medication
of
course
and
went
briskly
to
a
wall
cabinet
and
began
to
fiddle
with
medical
tools
howard
macklin
and
jonas
harrison
went
into
a
deep
telepathic
conference
that
was
interrupted
only
when
jonas
harrison
turned
to
phillip
to
say
you
have
to
provide
us
with
uninterrupted
time
somehow
marian
disengaged
herself
reluctantly
and
started
to
propel
me
out
of
the
room
go
help
him
steve
what
we
are
going
to
do
is
not
for
any
to
watch
outside
phillip
threatened
me
with
the
guard
key
mind
telling
a
what
the
devil
you
cooked
up
i
smiled
if
your
father
has
the
mental
power
to
erase
marian
from
my
mind
he
also
has
the
power
to
do
a
fine
reorientation
job
on
scholar
phelps
once
we
get
the
spiderwebs
cleaned
out
of
the
top
dog
we
start
down
the
pyramid
line
by
line
and
echelon
by
echelon
with
each
reoriented
recruit
adding
to
our
force
once
we
get
this
joint
operating
on
the
level
we
can
all
go
to
work
for
the
rest
of
the
human
race
there
is
little
left
to
tell
the
medical
center
and
the
highways
in
hiding
are
one
agency
dedicated
to
the
conquest
of
the
last
and
most
puzzling
of
the
diseases
and
maladies
that
beset
mankind
we
are
no
closer
to
a
solution
than
we
ever
were
and
so
i
am
still
a
very
busy
man
i
have
written
this
account
and
disclosed
our
secret
because
we
want
no
more
victims
of
mekstrom
disease
to
suffer
so
i
will
write
finish
with
one
earnest
plea
and
one
ray
of
hope
please
do
not
follow
one
of
our
highways
unless
you
are
already
infected
since
i
can
not
hope
to
inoculate
the
entire
human
race
and
will
not
pick
or
choose
certain
worthy
types
for
special
attention
i
will
deal
only
with
those
folks
who
find
mekstrom
disease
among
their
immediate
family
such
people
need
never
be
parted
from
their
loved
ones
the
rest
of
you
will
have
to
wait
your
turn
but
we
get
to
it
sooner
or
later
thirty
days
ago
steve
junior

born

a
healthy
little

impossible
someone
had
stolen
an
important
part
of
steve
cornell
life
it
was
bad
enough
when
his
fiancée
vanished
it
was
infinitely
worse
when
everyone
in
the
world
insisted
it
could
have
happened
the
way
he
knew
it
had
in
a
world
where
esp

were
normal
it
was
difficult
to
keep

but
steve
search
for
his
missing
sweetheart
brought
him
to
the
threshold
of
one
of
the
greatest
secrets
of
all
time
and
it
was
obvious
that
somebody
would
stop
at
nothing

keep
him
from
uncovering

were

symbols
along
