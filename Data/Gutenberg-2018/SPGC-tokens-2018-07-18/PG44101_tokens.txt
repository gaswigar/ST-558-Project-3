preface
to
the
third
edition
the
object
of
this
treatise
is
not
so
much
to
give
a
narrative
history
of
the
countries
included
in
the
empire
italy
during
the
middle
ages
germany
from
the
ninth
century
to
the
nineteenth
as
to
describe
the
holy
empire
itself
as
an
institution
or
system
the
wonderful
offspring
of
a
body
of
beliefs
and
traditions
which
have
almost
wholly
passed
away
from
the
world
such
a
description
however
would
not
be
intelligible
without
some
account
of
the
great
events
which
accompanied
the
growth
and
decay
of
imperial
power
and
it
has
therefore
appeared
best
to
give
the
book
the
form
rather
of
a
narrative
than
of
a
dissertation
and
to
combine
with
an
exposition
of
what
may
be
called
the
theory
of
the
empire
an
outline
of
the
political
history
of
germany
as
well
as
some
notices
of
the
affairs
of
mediæval
italy
to
make
the
succession
of
events
clearer
a
chronological
list
of
emperors
and
popes
has
been
prefixed
the
present
edition
has
been
carefully
revised
and
corrected
throughout
and
a
good
many
additions
have
been
made
to
both
text

in
the
english
newspapers
that
the
emperor
francis
ii
had
announced
to
the
diet
his
resignation
of
the
imperial
crown
there
were
probably
few
who
reflected
that
the
oldest
political
institution
in
the
world
had
come
to
an
end
yet
it
was
so
the
empire
which
a
note
issued
by
a
diplomatist
on
the
banks
of
the
danube
extinguished
was
the
same
which
the
crafty
nephew
of
julius
had
won
for
himself
against
the
powers
of
the
east
beneath
the
cliffs
of
actium
and
which
had
preserved
almost
unaltered
through
eighteen
centuries
of
time
and
through
the
greatest
changes
in
extent
in
power
in
character
a
title
and
pretensions
from
which
all
meaning
had
long
since
departed
nothing
else
so
directly
linked
the
old
world
to
the
new
nothing
else
displayed
so
many
strange
contrasts
of
the
present
and
the
past
and
summed
up
in
those
contrasts
so
much
of
european
history
from
the
days
of
constantine
till
far
down
into
the
middle
ages
it
was
conjointly
with
the
papacy
the
recognised
centre
and
head
of
christendom
exercising
over
the
minds
of
men
an
influence
such
as
its
material
strength
could
never
have
commanded
it
is
of
this
influence
and
of
the
causes
that
gave
it
power
rather
than
of
the
external
history
of
the
empire
that
the
following
pages
are
designed
to
treat
that
history
is
indeed
full
of
interest
and
brilliance
of
grand
characters
and
striking
situations
but
it
is
a
subject
too
vast
for
any
single
canvas
without
a
minuteness
of
detail
sufficient
to
make
its
scenes
dramatic
and
give
us
a
lively
sympathy
with
the
actors
a
narrative
history
can
have
little
value
and
still
less
charm
but
to
trace
with
any
minuteness
the
career
of
the
empire
would
be
to
write
the
history
of
christendom
from
the
fifth
century
to
the
twelfth
of
germany
and
italy
from
the
twelfth
to
the
nineteenth
while
even
a
narrative
of
more
restricted
scope
which
should
attempt
to
disengage
from
a
general
account
of
the
affairs
of
those
countries
the
events
that
properly
belong
to
imperial
history
could
hardly
be
compressed
within
reasonable
limits
it
is
therefore
better
declining
so
great
a
task
to
attempt
one
simpler
and
more
practicable
though
not
necessarily
inferior
in
interest
to
speak
less
of
events
than
of
principles
and
endeavour
to
describe
the
empire
not
as
a
state
but
as
an
institution
an
institution
created
by
and
embodying
a
wonderful
system
of
ideas
in
pursuance
of
such
a
plan
the
forms
which
the
empire
took
in
the
several
stages
of
its
growth
and
decline
must
be
briefly
sketched
the
characters
and
acts
of
the
great
men
who
founded
guided
and
overthrew
it
must
from
time
to
time
be
touched
upon
but
the
chief
aim
of
the
treatise
will
be
to
dwell
more
fully
on
the
inner
nature
of
the
empire
as
the
most
signal
instance
of
the
fusion
of
roman
and
teutonic
elements
in
modern
civilization
to
shew
how
such
a
combination
was
possible
how
charles
and
otto
were
led
to
revive
the
imperial
title
in
the
west
how
far
during
the
reigns
of
their
successors
it
preserved
the
memory
of
its
origin
and
influenced
the
european
commonwealth
of
nations
strictly
speaking
it
is
from
the
year
when
a
king
of
the
franks
was
crowned
emperor
of
the
romans
by
pope
leo
iii
that
the
beginning
of
the
holy
roman
empire
must
be
dated
but
in
history
there
is
nothing
isolated
and
just
as
to
explain
a
modern
act
of
parliament
or
a
modern
conveyance
of
lands
we
must
go
back
to
the
feudal
customs
of
the
thirteenth
century
so
among
the
institutions
of
the
middle
ages
there
is
scarcely
one
which
can
be
understood
until
it
is
traced
up
either
to
classical
or
to
primitive
teutonic
antiquity
such
a
mode
of
inquiry
is
most
of
all
needful
in
the
case
of
the
holy
empire
itself
no
more
than
a
tradition
a
fancied
revival
of
departed
glories
and
thus
in
order
to
make
it
clear
out
of
what
elements
the
imperial
system
was
formed
we
might
be
required
to
scrutinize
the
antiquities
of
the
christian
church
to
survey
the
constitution
of
rome
in
the
days
when
rome
was
no
more
than
the
first
of
the
latin
cities
nay
to
travel
back
yet
further
to
that
jewish
theocratic
polity
whose
influence
on
the
minds
of
the
mediæval
priesthood
was
necessarily
so
profound
practically
however
it
may
suffice
to
begin
by
glancing
at
the
condition
of
the
roman
world
in
the
third
and
fourth
centuries
of
the
christian
era
we
shall
then
see
the
old
empire
with
its
scheme
of
absolutism
fully
matured
we
shall
mark
how
the
new
religion
rising
in
the
midst
of
a
hostile
power
ends
by
embracing
and
transforming
it
and
we
shall
be
in
a
position
to
understand
what
impression
the
whole
huge
fabric
of
secular
and
ecclesiastical
government
which
roman
and
christian
had
piled
up
made
upon
the
barbarian
tribes
who
pressed
into
the
charmed
circle
of
the
ancient
civilization
chapter
ii
the
roman
empire
before
the
invasions
of
the
barbarians
sidenote
the
roman
empire
in
the
second
century
sidenote
obliteration
of
national
distinctions
sidenote
the
capital
that
ostentation
of
humility
which
the
subtle
policy
of
augustus
had
conceived
and
the
jealous
hypocrisy
of
tiberius
maintained
was
gradually
dropped
by
their
successors
till
despotism
became
at
last
recognised
in
principle
as
the
government
of
the
roman
empire
with
an
aristocracy
decayed
a
populace
degraded
an
army
no
longer
recruited
from
italy
the
semblance
of
liberty
that
yet
survived
might
be
swept
away
with
impunity
republican
forms
had
never
been
known
in
the
provinces
at
all
and
the
aspect
which
the
imperial
administration
had
originally
assumed
there
soon
reacted
on
its
position
in
the
capital
earlier
rulers
had
disguised
their
supremacy
by
making
a
slavish
senate
the
instrument
of
their
more
cruel
or
arbitrary
acts
as
time
went
on
even
this
veil
was
withdrawn
and
in
the
age
of
septimius
severus
the
emperor
stood
forth
to
the
whole
roman
world
as
the
single
centre
and
source
of
power
and
political
action
the
warlike
character
of
the
roman
state
was
preserved
in
his
title
of
general
his
provincial
lieutenants
were
military
governors
and
a
more
terrible
enforcement
of
the
theory
was
found
in
his
dependence
on
the
army
at
once
the
origin
and
support
of
all
authority
but
as
he
united
in
himself
every
function
of
government
his
sovereignty
was
civil
as
well
as
military
laws
emanated
from
him
all
officials
acted
under
his
commission
the
sanctity
of
his
person
bordered
on
divinity
this
increased
concentration
of
power
was
mainly
required
by
the
necessities
of
frontier
defence
for
within
there
was
more
decay
than
disaffection
few
troops
were
quartered
through
the
country
few
fortresses
checked
the
march
of
armies
in
the
struggles
which
placed
vespasian
and
severus
on
the
throne
the
distant
crash
of
war
from
the
rhine
or
the
euphrates
was
scarcely
heard
or
heeded
in
the
profound
quiet
of
the
mediterranean
coasts
where
with
piracy
fleets
had
disappeared
no
quarrels
of
race
or
religion
disturbed
that
calm
for
all
national
distinctions
were
becoming
merged
in
the
idea
of
a
common
empire
the
gradual
extension
of
roman
citizenship
through
the
the
working
of
the
equalized
and
equalizing
roman
law
the
even
pressure
of
the
government
on
all
subjects
the
movement
of
population
caused
by
commerce
and
the
slave
traffic
were
steadily
assimilating
the
various
peoples
emperors
who
were
for
the
most
part
natives
of
the
provinces
cared
little
to
cherish
italy
or
conciliate
rome
it
was
their
policy
to
keep
open
for
every
subject
a
career
by
whose
freedom
they
had
themselves
risen
to
greatness
and
to
recruit
the
senate
from
the
most
illustrious
families
in
the
cities
of
gaul
spain
and
asia
the
edict
by
which
caracalla
extended
to
all
natives
of
the
roman
world
the
rights
of
roman
citizenship
though
prompted
by
no
motives
of
kindness
proved
in
the
end
a
boon
annihilating
legal
distinctions
it
completed
the
work
which
trade
and
literature
and
toleration
to
all
beliefs
but
one
were
already
performing
and
left
so
far
as
we
can
tell
only
two
nations
still
cherishing
a
national
feeling
the
jew
was
kept
apart
by
his
religion
the
greek
boasted
his
original
intellectual
superiority
speculative
philosophy
lent
her
aid
to
this
general
assimilation
stoicism
with
its
doctrine
of
a
universal
system
of
nature
made
minor
distinctions
between
man
and
man
seem
insignificant
and
by
its
teachers
the
idea
of
cosmopolitanism
was
for
the
first
time
proclaimed
alexandrian
uniting
the
tenets
of
many
schools
first
bringing
the
mysticism
of
the
east
into
connection
with
the
logical
philosophies
of
greece
had
opened
up
a
new
ground
of
agreement
or
controversy
for
the
minds
of
all
the
world
yet
rome
commanding
position
was
scarcely
shaken
her
actual
power
was
indeed
confined
within
narrow
limits
rarely
were
her
senate
and
people
permitted
to
choose
the
sovereign
more
rarely
still
could
they
control
his
policy
neither
law
nor
custom
raised
them
above
other
subjects
or
accorded
to
them
any
advantage
in
the
career
of
civil
or
military
ambition
as
in
time
past
rome
had
sacrificed
domestic
freedom
that
she
might
be
the
mistress
of
others
so
now
to
be
universal
she
the
conqueror
had
descended
to
the
level
of
the
conquered
but
the
sacrifice
had
not
wanted
its
reward
from
her
came
the
laws
and
the
language
that
had
overspread
the
world
at
her
feet
the
nations
laid
the
offerings
of
their
labour
she
was
the
head
of
the
empire
and
of
civilization
and
in
riches
fame
and
splendour
far
outshone
as
well
the
cities
of
that
time
as
the
fabled
glories
of
babylon
or
persepolis
sidenote
diocletian
and
constantine
scarcely
had
these
slowly
working
influences
brought
about
this
unity
when
other
influences
began
to
threaten
it
new
foes
assailed
the
frontiers
while
the
loosening
of
the
structure
within
was
shewn
by
the
long
struggles
for
power
which
followed
the
death
or
deposition
of
each
successive
emperor
in
the
period
of
anarchy
after
the
fall
of
valerian
generals
were
raised
by
their
armies
in
every
part
of
the
empire
and
ruled
great
provinces
as
monarchs
apart
owning
no
allegiance
to
the
possessor
of
the
capital
the
founding
of
the
kingdoms
of
modern
europe
might
have
been
anticipated
by
two
hundred
years
had
the
barbarians
been
bolder
or
had
there
not
arisen
in
diocletian
a
prince
active
and
politic
enough
to
bind
up
the
fragments
before
they
had
lost
all
cohesion
meeting
altered
conditions
by
new
remedies
by
dividing
and
localizing
authority
he
confessed
that
the
weaker
heart
could
no
longer
make
its
pulsations
felt
to
the
body
extremities
he
parcelled
out
the
supreme
power
among
four
persons
and
then
sought
to
give
it
a
factitious
strength
by
surrounding
it
with
an
oriental
pomp
which
his
earlier
predecessors
would
have
scorned
the
sovereign
person
became
more
sacred
and
was
removed
further
from
the
subject
by
the
interposition
of
a
host
of
officials
the
prerogative
of
rome
was
menaced
by
the
rivalry
of
nicomedia
and
the
nearer
greatness
of
milan
constantine
trod
in
the
same
path
extending
the
system
of
titles
and
functionaries
separating
the
civil
from
the
military
placing
counts
and
dukes
along
the
frontiers
and
in
the
cities
making
the
household
larger
its
etiquette
stricter
its
offices
more
important
though
to
a
roman
eye
degraded
by
their
attachment
to
the
monarch
person
the
crown
became
for
the
first
time
the
fountain
of
honour
these
changes
brought
little
good
heavier

population
decreased

it
was
found
more
difficult
to
raise
native
troops
and
to
pay
any
troops
whatever
the
removal
of
the
seat
of
power
to
byzantium
if
it
prolonged
the
life
of
a
part
of
the
empire
shook
it
as
a
whole
by
making
the
separation
of
east
and
west
inevitable
by
it
rome
that
she
might
romanize
the
world
was
completed
for
though
the
new
capital
preserved
her
name
and
followed
her
customs
and
precedents
yet
now
the
imperial
sway
ceased
to
be
connected
with
the
city
which
had
created
it
thus
did
the
idea
of
roman
monarchy
become
more
universal
for
having
lost
its
local
centre
it
subsisted
no
longer
historically
but
so
to
speak
naturally
as
a
part
of
an
order
of
things
which
a
change
in
external
conditions
seemed
incapable
of
disturbing
henceforth
the
empire
would
be
unaffected
by
the
disasters
of
the
city
and
though
after
the
partition
of
the
empire
had
been
confirmed
by
valentinian
and
finally
settled
on
the
death
of
theodosius
the
seat
of
the
western
government
was
removed
first
to
milan
and
then
to
ravenna
neither
event
destroyed
rome
prestige
nor
the
notion
of
a
single
imperial
nationality
common
to
all
her
subjects
the
syrian
the
pannonian
the
briton
the
spaniard
still
called
himself
a
roman
sidenote
christianity
sidenote
its
alliance
with
the
state
for
that
nationality
was
now
beginning
to
be
supported
by
a
new
and
vigorous
power
the
emperors
had
indeed
opposed
it
as
disloyal
and
revolutionary
had
more
than
once
put
forth
their
whole
strength
to
root
it
out
but
the
unity
of
the
empire
and
the
ease
of
communication
through
its
parts
had
favoured
the
spread
of
christianity
persecution
had
scattered
the
seeds
more
widely
had
forced
on
it
a
firm
organization
had
given
it
and
a
history
when
constantine
partly
perhaps
from
a
genuine
moral
sympathy
yet
doubtless
far
more
in
the
belief
that
he
had
more
to
gain
from
the
zealous
sympathy
of
its
professors
than
he
could
lose
by
the
aversion
of
those
who
still
cultivated
a
languid
paganism
took
christianity
to
be
the
religion
of
the
empire
it
was
already
a
great
political
force
able
and
not
more
able
than
willing
to
repay
him
by
aid
and
submission
yet
the
league
was
struck
in
no
mere
mercenary
spirit
for
the
league
was
inevitable
of
the
evils
and
dangers
incident
to
the
system
then
founded
there
was
as
yet
no
experience
of
that
antagonism
between
church
and
state
which
to
a
modern
appears
so
natural
there
was
not
even
an
idea
among
the
jews
the
state
had
rested
upon
religion
among
the
romans
religion
had
been
an
integral
part
of
the
political
constitution
a
matter
far
more
of
national
or
tribal
or
family
feeling
than
of
personal
both
in
israel
and
at
rome
the
mingling
of
religious
with
civic
patriotism
had
been
harmonious
giving
strength
and
elasticity
to
the
whole
body
politic
so
perfect
a
union
was
now
no
longer
possible
in
the
roman
empire
for
the
new
faith
had
already
a
governing
body
of
her
own
in
those
rulers
and
teachers
whom
the
growth
of
sacramentalism
and
of
sacerdotalism
its
necessary
consequence
was
making
every
day
more
powerful
and
marking
off
more
sharply
from
the
mass
of
the
christian
people
since
therefore
the
ecclesiastical
organization
could
not
be
identical
with
the
civil
it
became
its
counterpart
suddenly
called
from
danger
and
ignominy
to
the
seat
of
power
and
finding
her
inexperience
perplexed
by
a
sphere
of
action
vast
and
varied
the
church
was
compelled
to
frame
herself
upon
the
model
of
the
secular
administration
where
her
own
machinery
was
defective
as
in
the
case
of
doctrinal
disputes
affecting
the
whole
christian
world
she
sought
the
interposition
of
the
sovereign
in
all
else
she
strove
not
to
sink
in
but
to
reproduce
for
herself
the
imperial
system
and
just
as
with
the
extension
of
the
empire
all
the
independent
rights
of
districts
towns
or
tribes
had
disappeared
so
now
the
primitive
freedom
and
diversity
of
individual
christians
and
local
churches
already
circumscribed
by
the
frequent
struggles
against
heresy
was
finally
overborne
by
the
idea
of
one
visible
catholic
church
uniform
in
faith
and
ritual
uniform
too
in
her
relation
to
the
civil
power
and
the
increasingly
oligarchical
character
of
her
government
thus
under
the
combined
force
of
doctrinal
theory
and
practical
needs
there
shaped
itself
a
hierarchy
of
patriarchs
metropolitans
and
bishops
their
jurisdiction
although
still
chiefly
spiritual
enforced
by
the
laws
of
the
state

the

of

so
far
as
she
could
be
said
to
have
a

was
virtually
the
emperor
himself
the
inchoate
right
to
intermeddle
in
religious
affairs
which
he
derived
from
the
office
of
pontifex
maximus
was
readily
admitted
and
the
clergy
preaching
the
duty
of
passive
obedience
now
as
it
had
been
preached
in
the
days
of
nero
and
diocletian
were
well
pleased
to
see
him
preside
in

issue
edicts
against

testify
even
by
arbitrary
measures
his
zeal
for
the
advancement
of
the
faith
and
the
overthrow
of

rites

though
the
tone
of
the

remained

strength
waxed
greater

were
occasions
wanting

revealed
the

that
was
in

it
was
to
the
church
that
the
life
and

of
the
people
sought
more
and
more
to
attach
themselves
and
when
in
the
fifth
century
the
horizon
grew
black
with
clouds
of
ruin
those
who
watched
with
despair
or
apathy
the
approach
of
irresistible
foes
fled
for
comfort
to
the
shrine
of
a
religion

even
those

revered

that
which
we

is
that

wherefore

historians
have
remarked
how
valuable
must
have
been
the
skill
of
roman
officials
to
princes
who
from
leaders
of
tribes
were
become
rulers
of
wide
lands
and
in
particular
how
indispensable
the
aid
of
the
christian
bishops
the
intellectual
aristocracy
of
their
new
subjects
whose
advice
could
alone
guide
their
policy
and
conciliate
the
vanquished
not
only
is
this
true
it
is
but
a
small
part
of
the
truth
one
form
of
that
manifold
and
overpowering
influence
which
the
old
system
exercised
over
its
foes
not
less
than
its
own
children
for
it
is
hardly
too
much
to
say
that
the
thought
of
antagonism
to
the
empire
and
the
wish
to
extinguish
it
never
crossed
the
mind
of
the
barbarians
the
conception
of
that
empire
was
too
universal
too
august
too
enduring
it
was
everywhere
around
them
and
they
could
remember
no
time
when
it
had
not
been
so
it
had
no
association
of
people
or
place
whose
fall
could
seem
to
involve
that
of
the
whole
fabric
it
had
that
connection
with
the
christian
church
which
made
it
and
venerable
sidenote
the
belief
in
its
eternity
there
were
especially
two
ideas
whereon
it
rested
and
from
which
it
obtained
a
peculiar
strength
and
a
peculiar
direction
the
one
was
the
belief
that
as
the
dominion
of
rome
was
universal
so
must
it
be
eternal
nothing
like
it
had
been
seen
before
the
empire
of
alexander
had
lasted
a
short
lifetime
and
within
its
wide
compass
were
included
many
arid
wastes
and
many
tracts
where
none
but
the
roving
savage
had
ever
set
foot
that
of
the
italian
city
had
for
fourteen
generations
embraced
all
the
most
wealthy
and
populous
regions
of
the
civilized
world
and
had
laid
the
foundations
of
its
power
so
deep
that
they
seemed
destined
to
last
for
ever
if
rome
moved
slowly
for
a
time
her
foot
was
always
planted
firmly
the
ease
and
swiftness
of
her
later
conquests
proved
the
solidity
of
the
earlier
and
to
her
more
justly
than
to
his
own
city
might
the
boast
of
the
athenian
historian
be
applied
that
she
advanced
farthest
in
prosperity
and
in
adversity
drew
back
the
least
from
the
end
of
the
republican
period
her
poets
her
orators
her
jurists
ceased
not
to
repeat
the
claim
of
and
confidently
predict
its
eternity
the
proud
belief
of
his
countrymen
which
virgil
had
expressed
ego
nec
metas
rerum
nec
tempora
pono
imperium
sine
fine
dedi
was
shared
by
the
early
christians
when
they
prayed
for
the
persecuting
power
whose
fall
would
bring
antichrist
upon
earth
lactantius
writes
rome
the
head
of
the
world
shall
have
fallen
who
can
doubt
that
the
end
is
come
of
human
things
aye
of
the
earth
itself
she
she
alone
is
the
state
by
which
all
things
are
upheld
even
until
now
wherefore
let
us
make
prayers
and
supplications
to
the
god
of
heaven
if
indeed
his
decrees
and
his
purposes
can
be
delayed
that
that
hateful
tyrant
come
not
sooner
than
we
look
for
he
for
whom
are
reserved
fearful
deeds
who
shall
pluck
out
that
eye
in
whose
extinction
the
world
itself
shall
perish
with
the
triumph
of
christianity
this
belief
had
found
a
new
basis
for
as
the
empire
had
decayed
the
church
had
grown
stronger
and
now
while
the
one
trembling
at
the
approach
of
the
destroyer
saw
province
after
province
torn
away
the
other
rising
in
stately
youth
prepared
to
fill
her
place
and
govern
in
her
name
and
in
doing
so
to
adopt
and
sanctify
and
propagate
anew
the
notion
of
a
universal
and
unending
state
sidenote
sanctity
of
the
imperial
name
the
second
chief
element
in
this
conception
was
the
association
of
such
a
state
with
one
irresponsible
governor
the
emperor
the
hatred
to
the
name
of
king
which
their
earliest
political
struggles
had
left
in
the
romans
by
obliging
their
ruler
to
take
a
new
and
strange
title
marked
him
off
from
all
the
other
sovereigns
of
the
world
to
the
provincials
especially
he
became
an
awful
impersonation
of
the
great
machine
of
government
which
moved
above
and
around
them
it
was
not
merely
that
he
was
like
a
modern
king
the

the

the

his

the

his
interposition
like
that
of
some
terrestrial

so
to

the

from

his

been
hallowed
by
the

of
chief

and
the
tribunician
power
to
swear
by
his

was
considered
the
most
solemn
of
all
oaths
his
effigy
was
sacred
even
on
a

to
him
or
to
his
genius
temples
were
erected
and
divine
honours
paid
while
he
lived
and
when
as
it
was
expressed
he
ceased
to
be
among
men
the
title
of
divus
was
accorded
to
him
after
a
solemn
consecration
in
the
confused
multiplicity
of
mythologies
the
worship
of
the
emperor
was
the
only
worship
common
to
the
whole
roman

was
therefore
that
usually
proposed
as
a
test
to
the
christians

the

the

the

as
state
admitted
at
nicæa
and
habitually
exercised
by
the
sovereigns
of
constantinople
made
the
emperor
hardly
less
essential
to
the
new
conception
of
a
christian
monarchy
than
he
had
been
to
the
military
despotism
of
old
these
considerations
explain
why
the
men
of
the
fifth
century
clinging
to
preconceived
ideas
refused
to
believe
in
that
dissolution
of
the
empire
which
they
saw
with
their
own
eyes
because
it
could
not
die
it
lived
and
there
was
in
the
slowness
of
the
change
and
its
external
aspect
as
well
as
in
the
fortunes
of
the
capital
something
to
favour
the
illusion
the
roman
name
was
shared
by
every
subject
the
roman
city
was
no
longer
the
seat
of
government
nor
did
her
capture
extinguish
the
imperial
power
for
the
maxim
was
now
accepted
where
the
emperor
is
there
is
rome
but
her
continued
existence
not
permanently
occupied
by
any
conqueror
striking
the
nations
with
an
awe
which
the
history
or
the
external
splendours
of
constantinople
milan
or
ravenna
could
nowise
inspire
was
an
ever
new
assertion
of
the
endurance
of
the
roman
race
and
dominion
dishonoured
and
defenceless
the
spell
of
her
name
was
still
strong
enough
to
arrest
the
conqueror
in
the
moment
of
triumph
the
irresistible
impulse
that
drew

one
of

two
points
deserve
special
remark
its
continued
union
with
the
eastern
branch
and
the
way
in
which
its
ideal
dignity
was
respected
while
its
representatives
were
despised
after
stilicho
death
and
invasion
its
fall
was
a
question
of

while
one

the

abandoned
by
the
central

left
either
to
be

when
he
presumed
to
forget
his

though
the
division
between
arcadius
and
honorius
had
definitely
severed
the
two
realms
for
administrative
purposes
they
were
still
supposed
to
constitute
a

and
the

were
bounded
by
the

the
bolder
genius
of
odoacer
general
of
the
barbarian
auxiliaries
resolved
to
abolish
an
empty
pageant
and
extinguish
the
title
and
office
of
emperor
of
the
west
yet
over
him
too
the
spell
had
power
and
as
the
gaulish
warrior
had
gazed
on
the
silent
majesty
of
the
senate
in
a
deserted
city
so
the
herulian
revered
the
power
before
which
the
world
had
bowed
and
though
there
was
no
force
to
check
or
to
affright
him
shrank
from
grasping
in
his
own
barbarian
hand
the
sceptre
of
the
cæsars
when
at
odoacer
bidding
romulus
augustulus
the
boy
whom
a
whim
of
fate
had
chosen
to
be
the
last
native
cæsar
of
rome
had
formally
announced
his
resignation
to
the
senate
a
deputation
from
that
body
proceeded
to
the
eastern
court
to
lay
the
insignia
of
royalty
at
the
feet
of
the
eastern
emperor
zeno
the
west
they
declared
no
longer
required
an
emperor
of
its
own
one
monarch
sufficed
for
the
world
odoacer
was
qualified
by
his
wisdom
and
courage
to
be
the
protector
of
their
state
and
upon
him
zeno
was
entreated
to
confer
the
title
of
patrician
and
the
administration
of
the
italian
provinces
the
emperor
granted
what
he
could
not
refuse
and
odoacer
taking
the
title
of
king
continued
the
consular
office
respected
the
civil
and
ecclesiastical
institutions
of
his
subjects
and
ruled
for
fourteen
years
as
the
nominal
vicar
of
the
eastern
emperor
there
was
thus
legally
no
extinction
of
the
western
empire
at
all
but
only
a
reunion
of
east
and
west
in
form
and
to
some
extent
also
in
the
belief
of
men
things
now
reverted
to
their
state
during
the
first
two
centuries
of
the
empire
save
that
byzantium
instead
of
rome
was
the
centre
of
the
civil
government
the
joint
tenancy
which
had
been
conceived
by
diocletian
carried
further
by
constantine
renewed
under
valentinian
i
and
again
at
the
death
of
theodosius

come
to
an
end
once
more
did
a

sway
the

of

an
undivided
catholic

to
those
who
lived
at

this

was
no
such
epoch
as
it
has
since
become
nor
was
any
impression
made
on
men

commensurate
with
the
real
significance
of
the
event
for
though
it
did
not
destroy
the
empire
in
idea
nor
wholly
even
in
fact
its
consequences
were
from
the
first
great
it
hastened
the
development
of
a
latin
as
opposed
to
greek
and
oriental
forms
of
christianity
it
emancipated
the
popes
it
gave
a
new
character
to
the
projects
and
government
of
the
teutonic
rulers
of
the
west
but
the
importance
of
remembering
its
formal
aspect
to
those
who
witnessed
it
will
be
felt
as
we
approach
the
era
when
the

was
revived
by
charles

not
more
oppressive
than
those
of
his
neighbours
in
gaul
spain
and
africa
but
the
mercenary
who
supported
it
were
a
loose
swarm
of
predatory
tribes
themselves
without
cohesion
they
could
take
no
firm
root
in
italy
during
the
eighteen
years
of
his
reign
no
progress
seems
to
have
been
made
towards
the
of
society
and
the
first
real
attempt
to
blend
the
peoples
and
maintain
the
traditions
of
roman
wisdom
in
the
hands
of
a
new
and
vigorous

sought
no

conquest
easy
as
it
would
have
been
to
tear
away

provinces
from

but
strove
only
to
preserve
and
strengthen
the
ancient
polity
of
rome
to
breathe
into
her
decaying
institutions
the
spirit
of
a
fresh
life

without
endangering
the
military

apace
as

were
changed
by
the

were
narrowed

have
perished

but
for
the
two

had
left
her
church
and
her
law
the
barbarians
had
at
first
associated
christianity
with
the

as
their
only
bulwark
against

the
natural

the
necessary
councillors
of
the
king
their
power
grew
with
the
extinction
of
civil
government
and
the
spread
of
superstition
and
when
the
frank
found
it
too
valuable
to
be
abandoned
to
the
vanquished
people
he
insensibly
acquired
the
feelings
and
policy
of
the
order
he
entered

as
the
empire
fell
to
pieces
and
the
new
kingdoms
which
the
conquerors
had
founded
themselves
began
to
dissolve
the
church
clung
more
closely
to
her
unity
of
faith
and
discipline
the
common
bond
of
all
christian
men
that
unity
must
have
a
centre
that
centre

that
which
she
had
lost
over

only
second
in
importance
to
this
influence
was
that
which
was
exercised
by
the
permanence
of
the
old

of
its

the

of
many

the
most

those
who
read
the

of
an
age
in
the
light
of
those
that
followed
it
to
perceive
that
in
this
men
erred
that
the
tendency
of
events
was
wholly
different
that
society
had
entered
on
a
new
phase
wherein
every
change
did
more
to
localize
authority
and
strengthen
the
aristocratic
principle
at
the
expense
of
the
despotic
we
can
see
that
other
forms
of
life
more
full
of
promise
for
the
distant
future
had
already
begun
to
shew
themselves
they
with
no
type
of
power
or
beauty
but
that
which
had
filled
the
imagination
of
their
forefathers
and
now
loomed
on
them
grander
than
ever
through
the
mist
of
centuries
mistook

it

been

the

nor
although
the
widest
and
strongest
empire
that
had
yet
been
founded
by
a
teutonic
race
was
it
under
the
merovingian
kings
a
united
kingdom
at
all
but
rather
a
congeries
of
principalities
held
together
by
the
predominance
of
a
single
nation
and
a
single
family
who
ruled
in
gaul
as
masters
over
a
subject
race
and
in
germany
exercised
a
sort
of
hegemony
among
kindred
and
scarcely
inferior
tribes
but
towards
the
middle
of
the
eighth
century
a
change
began
under
the
rule
of
pipin
of
herstal
and
his
son
charles
martel
mayors
of
the
palace
to
the
last
feeble
merovingians
the
austrasian
franks
in
the
lower
rhineland
became
acknowledged
heads
of
the
nation
and
were
able
while
establishing
a
firmer
government
at
home
to
direct
its
whole
strength
in
projects
of
foreign
ambition
the
form
those
projects
took
arose
from
a
circumstance
which
has
not
yet
been
mentioned
it
was
not
solely
or
even
chiefly
to
their
own
valour
that
the
franks
owed
their
past
greatness
and
the
yet
loftier
future
which
awaited
them
it
was
to
the
friendship
of
the
clergy
and
the
favour
of
the
apostolic
see
the
other
teutonic
nations
goths
vandals
burgundians
suevians
lombards
had
been
most
of
them
converted
by
arian
missionaries
who
proceeded
from
the
roman
empire
during
the
short
period
when
arian
doctrines
were
in
the
ascendant
the
franks
who
were
among
the
latest
converts
were
catholics
from
the
first
and
gladly
accepted
the
clergy
as
their
teachers
and
allies
thus
it
was
that
while
the
hostility
of
their
orthodox
subjects
destroyed
the
vandal
kingdom
in
africa
and
the
ostrogothic
kingdom
in
italy
the
eager
sympathy
of
the
priesthood
enabled
the
franks
to
vanquish
their
burgundian
and
visigothic
enemies
and
made
it
comparatively
easy
for
them
to
blend
with
the
roman
population

the

of

sidenote
import
of
this
title
as
a
foreshadowing
of
the
higher
dignity
that
was
to
follow
this
title
requires
a
passing
notice
introduced
by
constantine
at
a
time
when
its
original
meaning
had
been
long
forgotten
it
was
designed
to
be
and
for
awhile
remained
the
name
not
of
an
office
but
of
a
rank
the
highest
after
those
of
emperor
and
consul
as
such
it
was
usually
conferred
upon
provincial
governors
of
the
first
class
and
in
time
also
upon
barbarian
potentates
whose
vanity
the
roman
court
might
wish
to
flatter
thus
odoacer
theodoric
the
burgundian
king
sigismund
clovis
himself
had
all
received
it
from
the
eastern
emperor
so
too
in
still
later
times
it
was
given
to
saracenic
and
bulgarian
princes
in
the
sixth
and
seventh
centuries
an
invariable
practice
seems
to
have
attached
it
to
the
byzantine
viceroys
of
italy
and
thus
as
we
may
conjecture
a
natural
confusion
of
ideas
had
made
men
take
it
to
be
in
some
sense
an
official
title
conveying
an
extensive
though
undefined
authority
and
implying
in
particular
the
duty
of
overseeing
the
church
and
promoting
her
temporal
interests
it
was
doubtless
with
such
a
meaning
that
the
romans
and
their
bishop
bestowed
it
upon
the
frankish
kings
acting
quite
without
legal
right
for
it
could
emanate
from
the
emperor
alone
but
choosing
it
as
the
title
which
bound
its
possessor
to
render
to
the
church
support
and
defence
against
her
lombard
foes
hence
the
phrase
is
always
not
as
in
former
times
alone
hence
it
is
usually
associated
with
the
terms
and
and
since
implies
a
corresponding
measure
of
obedience
on
the
part
of
those
who
profit
by
it
there
must
have
been
conceded
to
the
new
patrician

or
less

the
positive
authority
in

was
moderate
in

he

with
a
strange
sense
half
of
sadness
half
of
amusement
that
in
watching
the
progress
of
this
grand
historical
drama
we
recognise
the
meaner
motives
by
which
its
chief
actors
were
influenced
the
frankish
king
and
the
roman
pontiff
were
for
the
time
the
two
most
powerful
forces
that
urged
the
movement
of
the
world
leading
it
on
by
swift
steps
to
a
mighty
crisis
of
its
fate

guided
as
it
might
well
seem
by
the
purest
zeal
for
its
spiritual
welfare
their
words
and
acts
their
whole
character
and
bearing
in
the
sight
of
expectant
christendom
were
worthy
of
men
destined
to
leave
an
indelible
impress
on
their
own
and
many
succeeding
ages
nevertheless
in
them
too
appears
the
undercurrent
of
vulgar
human
desires
and
passions
the
lofty
and
fervent
mind
of
charles
was
not
free
from
the
stirrings
of
personal
ambition
yet
these
may
be
excused
if
not
defended
as
almost
inseparable
from
an
intense
and
restless
genius
which
be
it
never
so
unselfish
in
its
ends

in
pursuing
them
fix
upon
everything
its
grasp
and
raise
out
of
everything
its
monument
the
policy
of
the
popes
was
prompted
by
motives
less
noble
ever
since
the
extinction
of
the
western
empire
had
emancipated
the
ecclesiastical
potentate
from
secular
control
the
first
and
most
abiding
object
of
his
schemes
and
prayers
had
been
the
acquisition
of
territorial
wealth
in
the
neighbourhood

had
indeed

of
justification

crowded
with
poor
for
whom
it
devolved

provide
yet
the
pursuit
was
one
which
could
not
fail
to
pervert
the
purposes
of
the
popes
and
give
a
sinister
character
to
all
they
did
it
was
this
fear
for
the
lands
of
the
church
far
more
than
for
religion
or
the
safety
of
the
city
neither
of
which
were
really
endangered
by
the
lombard
attacks
that
had
prompted
their
passionate
appeals

charles
martel
and
pipin
it
was
now
the
hope
of
having
these
possessions
confirmed
and
extended
by
pipin
greater
son
that
made
the
roman
ecclesiastics
so
forward
in
his
cause
and
it
was
the

lust

wealth

pomp
mingled
with
the
dawning
prospect
of

sullied

by
what
right
it
might
well
be
asked
did
the
factions
of

impose
a
master
on
the
original
seat
of

it
was
time
to
provide
better
for
the
most
august
of
human
offices
an
election
at
rome
was
as
valid
as
at
constantinople
the
possessor
of
the
real
power
should
also
be
clothed
with
the
outward
dignity
nor
could
it
be
doubted
where
that
possessor
was
to
be
found
the
frank
had
been
always
faithful
to
rome
his
baptism
was
the
enlistment
of
a
new
barbarian
auxiliary
his
services
against
arian
heretics
and
lombard
marauders
against
the
saracen
of
spain
and
the
avar
of
pannonia
had
earned
him
the
title
of
champion
of
the
faith
and
defender
of
the
holy
see
he
was
now
unquestioned
lord
of
western
europe
whose
subject
nations
keltic
and
teutonic
were
eager
to
be
called
by
his
name
and
to
imitate
his
customs

charles
the
hero
who
united
under
one
sceptre
so
many
races
who
ruled
all
as
the
vicegerent
of

the
pontiff
might
well
see
as
later
ages
saw
the
new
golden
head
of
a
second

erected
on
the
ruins

charles
remained
in
the
city
for
some
weeks
and
on
he
heard
mass
in
the
basilica

on
the
spot
where
now
the
gigantic
dome
of
bramante

michael

towers
over
the

of
the

the
spot

had
hallowed

constantine
the

erected
the

was
this

those
northern

shadowy

crowded
with

all

its
brightness
its

charles
who
had
exchanged
his

frankish
dress
for
the

and
the
chlamys
of
a
roman
patrician
knelt
in
prayer
by

in

of
all
he
placed
upon

at
the
central
point

end
of

it

well

better
than

i
believe
without
foundation
it
is
now
enclosed
in

gorgeous

of

and
placed

at

empire

of

the
coronation
of
charles
is
not
only
the
central
event
of
the
middle
ages
it
is
also
one
of
those
very
few
events
of
which
taking
them
singly
it
may
be
said
that
if
they
had
not
happened
the
history
of
the
world
would
have
been
different
in
one
sense
indeed
it
has
scarcely
a
parallel
the
assassins
of
julius
cæsar
thought
that
they
had
saved
rome
from
monarchy
but
monarchy
came
inevitable
in
the
next
generation
the
conversion
of
constantine
changed
the
face
of
the
world
but
christianity
was
spreading
fast
and
its
ultimate
triumph
was
only
a
question
of
time
had
columbus
never
spread
his
sails
the
secret
of
the
western
sea
would
yet
have
been
pierced
by
some
later
voyager
had
charles
v
broken
his
to
luther
the
voice
silenced
at
wittenberg
would
have
been
taken
up
by
echoes
elsewhere
but
if
the
roman
empire
had
not
been
restored
in
the
west
in
the
person
of
charles
it
would
never
have
been
restored
at
all
and
the
inexhaustible
train
of
consequences
for
good
and
for
evil
that
followed
could
not
have
been
why
this
was
so
may
be
seen
by
examining
the
history
of
the
next
two
centuries
in
that
day
as
through
all
the
dark
and
middle
ages
two
forces
were
striving
for
the
mastery
the
one
was
the
instinct
of
separation
disorder
anarchy
caused
by
the
ungoverned
impulses
and
barbarous
ignorance
of
the
great
bulk
of
mankind
the
other
was
that
passionate
longing
of
the
better
minds
for
a
formal
unity
of
government
which
had
its
historical
basis
in
the
memories
of
the
old
roman
empire
and
its
most
constant
expression
in
the
devotion
to
a
visible
and
catholic
church
the
former
tendency
as
everything
shews
was
in
politics
at
least
the
stronger
but
the
latter
used
and
stimulated
by
an
extraordinary
genius
like
charles
achieved
in
the
year
a
victory
whose
results
were
never
to
be
lost
when
the
hero
was
gone
the
returning
wave
of
anarchy
and
barbarism
swept
up
violent
as
ever
yet
it
could
not
wholly
obliterate
the
past
the
empire
maimed
and
shattered
though
it
was
had
struck
its
roots
too
deep
to
be
overthrown
by
force
and
when
it
perished
at
last
perished
from
inner
decay
it
was
just
because
men
felt
that
no
one
less
than
charles
could
have
won
such
a
triumph
over
the
evils
of
the
time
by
framing
and
establishing
a
gigantic
scheme
of
government
that
the
excitement
and
hope
and
joy
which
the
coronation
evoked
were
so
intense
their
best
evidence
is
perhaps
to
be
found
not
in
the
records
of
that
time
itself
but
in
the
cries
of
lamentation
that
broke
forth
when
the
empire
began
to
dissolve
towards
the
close
of
the
ninth
century
in
the
marvellous
legends
which
attached
themselves
to
the
name
of
charles
the
emperor
a
hero
of
whom
any
exploit
was
credible
in
the
devout
admiration
wherewith
his
german
successors
looked
back
to
and
strove
in
all
things
to
imitate
their
all
but
superhuman
prototype
sidenote
import
of
the
coronation
as
the
event
of
made
an
unparalleled
impression
on
those
who
lived
at
the
time
so
has
it
engaged
the
attention
of
men
in
succeeding
ages
has
been
viewed
in
the
most
opposite
lights
and
become
the
theme
of
interminable
controversies
it
is
better
to
look
at
it
simply
as
it
appeared
to
the
men
who
witnessed
it
here
as
in
so
many
other
cases
may
be
seen
the
errors
into
which
jurists
have
been
led
by
the
want
of
historical
feeling
in
rude
and
unsettled
states
of
society
men
respect
forms
and
obey
facts
while
careless
of
rules
and
principles
in
england
for
example
in
the
eleventh
and
twelfth
centuries
it
signified
very
little
whether
an
aspirant
to
the
throne
was
next
lawful
heir
but
it
signified
a
great
deal
whether
he
had
been
duly
crowned
and
was
supported
by
a
strong
party
regarding
the
matter
thus
it
is
not
hard
to
see
why
those
who
judged
the
actors
of
as
they
would
have
judged
their
contemporaries
should
have
misunderstood
the
nature
of
that
which
then
came
to
pass
baronius
and
bellarmine
spanheim
and
conring
are
advocates
bound
to
prove
a
thesis
and
therefore
believing
it
nor
does
either
party
find
any
lack
of
plausible
arguments
but
civilian
and
canonist
alike
proceed
upon
strict
legal
principles
and
no
such
principles
can
be
found
in
the
case
or
applied
to
it
neither
the
instances
cited
by
the
cardinal
from
the
old
testament
of
the
power
of
priests
to
set
up
and
pull
down
princes
nor
those
which
shew
the
earlier
emperors
controlling
the
bishops
of
rome
really
meet
the
question
leo
acted
not
as
having
alone
the
right
to
transfer
the
crown
the
practice
of
hereditary
succession
and
the
theory
of
popular
election
would
have
equally
excluded
such
a
claim
he
was
the
spokesman
of
the
popular
will
which
identifying
itself
with
the
sacerdotal
power
hated
the
greeks
and
was
grateful
to
the
franks
yet
he
was
also
something
more
the
act
as
it
specially
affected
his
interests
was
mainly
his
work
and
without
him
would
never
have
been
brought
about
at
all
it
was
natural
that
a
confusion
of
his
secular
functions
as
leader
and
his
spiritual
as
consecrating
priest
should
lay
the
foundation
of
the
right
claimed
afterwards
of
raising
and
deposing
monarchs
at
the
will
of
christ
vicar
the
emperor
was
passive
throughout
he
did
not
as
in
lombardy
appear
as
a
conqueror
but
was
received
by
the
pope
and
the
people
as
a
friend
and
ally
rome
no
doubt
became
his
capital
but
it
had
already
obeyed
him
as
patrician
and
the
greatest
fact
that
stood
out
to
posterity
from
the
whole
transaction
was
that
the
crown
was
bestowed
was
at
least
imposed
by
the
hands
of
the
pontiff
he
seemed
the
trustee
and
depositary
of
the
imperial
authority
sidenote
contemporary
accounts
the
best
way
of
shewing
the
thoughts
and
motives
of
those
concerned
in
the
transaction
is
to
transcribe
the
narratives
of
three
contemporary
or
almost
contemporary
annalists
two
of
them
german
and
one
italian
the
annals
of
lauresheim
say
because
the
name
of

had
now
ceased
among
the

their
empire
was
possessed

it
then
seemed
both
to
leo
the
pope
himself
and
to
all
the
holy
fathers
who
were
present
in
the
selfsame
council
as
well
as
to
the
rest
of
the
christian
people
that
they
ought
to
take
to
be
emperor
charles
king
of
the
franks
who
held
rome
herself
where
the
cæsars
had
always
been
wont
to
sit
and
all
the
other
regions
which
he
ruled
through
italy
and
gaul
and
germany
and
inasmuch
as
god
had
given
all
these
lands
into
his
hand
it
seemed
right
that
with
the
help
of
god
and
at
the
prayer
of
the
whole
christian
people
he
should
have
the
name
of
emperor
also
whose
petition
king
charles
willed
not
to
refuse
but
submitting
himself
with
all
humility
to
god
and
at
the
prayer
of
the
priests
and
of
the
whole
christian
people
on
the
day
of
the
nativity
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
he
took
on
himself
the
name
of
emperor
being
consecrated
by
the
lord
pope
leo
very
similar
in
substance
is
the
account
of
the
chronicle
of
moissac
ad
ann
when
the
king
upon
the
most
holy
day
of
the
lord
birth
was
rising
to
the
mass
after
praying
before
the
confession
of
the
blessed
peter
the
apostle
leo
the
pope
with
the
consent
of
all
the
bishops
and
priests
and
of
the
senate
of
the
franks
and
likewise
of
the
romans
set
a
golden
crown
upon
his
head
the
roman
people
also
shouting
aloud
and
when
the
people
had
made
an
end
of
chanting
the
laudes
he
was
adored
by
the
pope
after
the
manner
of
the
emperors
of
old
for
this
also
was
done
by
the
will
of
god
for
while
the
said
emperor
abode
at
rome
certain
men
were
brought
unto
him
who
said
that
the
name
of
emperor
had
ceased
among
the
greeks
and
that
among
them
the
empire
was
held
by
a
woman
called
irene
who
had
by
guile
laid
hold
on
her
son
the
emperor
and
put
out
his
eyes
and
taken
the
empire
to
herself
as
it
is
written
of
athaliah
in
the
book
of
the
kings
which
when
leo
the
pope
and
all
the
assembly
of
the
bishops
and
priests
and
abbots
heard
and
the
senate
of
the
franks
and
all
the
elders
of
the
romans
they
took
counsel
with
the
rest
of
the
christian
people
that
they
should
name
charles
king
of
the
franks
to
be
emperor
seeing
that
he
held
rome
the
mother
of
empire
where
the
cæsars
and
emperors
were
always
used
to
sit
and
that
the
heathen
might
not
mock
the
christians
if
the
name
of
emperor
should
have
ceased
among
the
christians
these
two
accounts
are
both
from
a
german
source
that
which
follows
is
roman
written
probably
within
some
fifty
or
sixty
years
of
the
event
it
is
taken
from
the
life
of
leo
iii
in
the
pontificum
compiled
by
anastasius
the
papal
librarian
these
things
came
the
day
of
the
birth
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
and
all
men
were
again
gathered
together
in
the
aforesaid
basilica
of
the
blessed
peter
the
apostle
and
then
the
gracious
and
venerable
pontiff
did
with
his
own
hands
crown
charles
with
a
very
precious
crown
then
all
the
faithful
people
of
rome
seeing
the
defence
that
he
gave
and
the
love
that
he
bare
to
the
holy
roman
church
and
her
vicar
did
by
the
will
of
god
and
of
the
blessed
peter
the
keeper
of
the
keys
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
cry
with
one
accord
with
a
loud
voice
charles
the
most
pious
augustus
crowned
of
god
the
great
and
peacegiving
emperor
be
life
and
victory
while
he
before
the
holy
confession
of
the
blessed
peter
the
apostle
was
invoking
divers
saints
it
was
proclaimed
thrice
and
he
was
chosen
by
all
to
be
emperor
of
the
romans
thereon
the
most
holy
pontiff
anointed
charles
with
holy
oil
and
likewise
his
most
excellent
son
to
be
king
upon
the
very
day
of
the
birth
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
and
when
the
mass
was
finished
then
after
the
mass
the
most
serene
lord
emperor
offered
gifts
sidenote
impression
which
they
convey
sidenote
later
theories
respecting
the
coronation
in
these
three
accounts
there
is
no
serious
discrepancy
as
to
the
facts
although
the
italian
priest
as
is
natural
heightens
the
importance
of
the
part
played
by
the
pope
while
the
germans
are
too
anxious
to
rationalize
the
event
talking
of
a
synod
of
the
clergy
a
consultation
of
the
people
and
a
formal
request
to
charles
which
the
silence
of
eginhard
as
well
as
the
other
circumstances
of
the
case
forbid
us
to
accept
as
literally
true
similarly
anastasius
passes
over
the
adoration
rendered
by
the
pope
to
the
emperor
upon
which
most
of
the
frankish
records
insist
in
a
way
which
puts
it
beyond
doubt
but
the
impression
which
the
three
narratives
leave
is
essentially
the
same
they
all
shew
how
little
the
transaction
can
be
made
to
wear
a
strictly
legal
character
the
frankish
king
does
not
of
his
own
might
seize
the
crown
but
rather
receives
it
as
coming
naturally
to
him
as
the
legitimate
consequence
of
the
authority
he
already
enjoyed
the
pope
bestows
the
crown
not
in
virtue
of
any
right
of
his
own
as
head
of
the
church
he
is
merely
the
instrument
of
god
providence
which
has
unmistakeably
pointed
out
charles
as
the
proper
person
to
defend
and
lead
the
christian
commonwealth
the
roman
people
do
not
formally
elect
and
appoint
but
by
their
applause
accept
the
chief
who
is
presented
to
them
the
act
is
conceived
of
as
directly
ordered
by
the
divine
providence
which
has
brought
about
a
state
of
things
that
admits
of
but
one
issue
an
issue
which
king
priest
and
people
have
only
to
recognise
and
obey
their
personal
ambitions
passions
intrigues
sinking
and
vanishing
in
reverential
awe
at
what
seems
the
immediate
interposition
of
heaven
and
as
the
result
is
desired
by
all
parties
alike
they
do
not
think
of
inquiring
into
one
another
rights
but
take
their
momentary
harmony
to
be
natural
and
necessary
never
dreaming
of
the
difficulties
and
conflicts
which
were
to
arise
out
of
what
seemed
then
so
simple
and
it
was
just
because
everything
was
thus
left
undetermined
resting
not
on
express
stipulation
but
rather
on
a
sort
of
mutual
understanding
a
sympathy
of
beliefs
and
wishes
which
augured
no
evil
that
the
event
admitted
of
being
afterwards
represented
in
so
many
different
lights
four
centuries
later
when
papacy
and
empire
had
been
forced
into
the
mortal
struggle
by
which
the
fate
of
both
was
decided
three
distinct
theories
regarding
the
coronation
of
charles
will
be
found
advocated
by
three
different
parties
all
of
them
plausible
all
of
them
to
some
extent
misleading
the
swabian
emperors
held
the
crown
to
have
been
won
by
their
great
predecessor
as
the
prize
of
conquest
and
drew
the
conclusion
that
the
citizens
and
bishop
of
rome
had
no
rights
as
against
themselves
the
patriotic
party
among
the
romans
appealing
to
the
early
history
of
the
empire
declared
that
by
nothing
but
the
voice
of
their
senate
and
people
could
an
emperor
be
lawfully
created
he
being
only
their
chief
magistrate
the
temporary
depositary
of
their
authority
the
popes
pointed
to
the
indisputable
fact
that
leo
imposed
the
crown
and
argued
that
as
god
earthly
vicar
it
was
then
his
and
must
always
continue
to
be
their
right
to
give
to
whomsoever
they
would
an
office
which
was
created
to
be
the
handmaid
of
their
own
of
these
three
it
was
the
last
view
that
eventually
prevailed
yet
to
an
impartial
eye
it
can
not
claim
any
more
than
do
the
two
others
to
contain
the
whole
truth
charles
did
not
conquer
nor
the
pope
give
nor
the
people
elect
as
the
act
was
unprecedented
so
was
it
illegal
it
was
a
revolt
of
the
ancient
western
capital
against
a
daughter
who
had
become
a
mistress
an
exercise
of
the
sacred
right
of
insurrection
justified
by
the
weakness
and
wickedness
of
the
byzantine
princes
hallowed
to
the
eyes
of
the
world
by
the
sanction
of
christ
representative
but
founded
upon
no
law
nor
competent
to
create
any
for
the
future
sidenote
was
the
coronation
a
surprise
it
is
an
interesting
and
somewhat
perplexing
question
how
far
the
coronation
scene
an
act
as
imposing
in
its
circumstances
as
it
was
momentous
in
its
results
was
prearranged
among
the
parties
eginhard
tells
us
that
charles
was
accustomed
to
declare
that
he
would
not
even
on
so
high
a
festival
have
entered
the
church
had
he
known
of
the
pope
intention
even
if
the
monarch
had
uttered
the
secretary
would
hardly
have
recorded
a
falsehood
long
after
the
motive
that
might
have
prompted
it
had
disappeared
of
the
existence
of
that
motive
which
has
been
most
commonly
assumed
a
fear
of
the
discontent
of
the
franks
who
might
think
their
liberties
endangered
little
or
no
proof
can
be
brought
from
the
records
of
the
time
wherein
the
nation
is
represented
as
exulting
in
the
new
dignity
of
their
chief
as
an
accession
of
grandeur
to
themselves
nor
can
we
suppose
that
disavowal
was
meant
to
soothe
the
offended
pride
of
the
byzantine
princes
from
whom
he
had
nothing
to
fear
and
who
were
none
the
more
likely
to
recognise
his
dignity
if
they
should
believe
it
to
be
not
of
his
own
seeking
yet
it
is
hard
to
suppose
the
whole
affair
a
surprise
for
it
was
the
goal
towards
which
the
policy
of
the
frankish
kings
had
for
many
years
pointed
and
charles
himself
in
sending
before
him
to
rome
many
of
the
spiritual
and
temporal
magnates
of
his
realm
in
summoning
thither
his
son
pipin
from
the
war
against
the
lombards
of
benevento
had
shewn
that
he
expected
some
more
than
ordinary
result
from
this
journey
to
the
imperial
city
alcuin
moreover
alcuin
of
york
the
prime
minister
of
charles
in
matters
religious
and
literary
appears
from
one
of
his
extant
letters
to
have
sent
as
a
christmas
gift
to
his
royal
pupil
a
carefully
corrected
and
superbly
adorned
copy
of
the
scriptures
with
the
words
splendorem
imperialis
potentiæ
this
has
commonly
been
taken
for
conclusive
evidence
that
the
plan
had
been
settled
beforehand
and
such
it
would
be
were
there
not
some
reasons
for
giving
the
letter
an
earlier
date
and
looking
upon
the
word
as
a
mere
magniloquent
flourish
more
weight
is
therefore
to
be
laid
upon
the
arguments
supplied
by
the
nature
of
the
case
itself
the
pope
whatever
his
confidence
in
the
sympathy
of
the
people
would
never
have
ventured
on
so
momentous
a
step
until
previous
conferences
had
assured
him
of
the
feelings
of
the
king
nor
could
an
act
for
which
the
assembly
were
evidently
prepared
have
been
kept
a
secret
nevertheless
the
declaration
of
charles
himself
can
neither
be
evaded
nor
set
down
to
mere
dissimulation
it
is
more
just
to
him
and
on
the
whole
more
reasonable
to
suppose
that
leo
having
satisfied
himself
of
the
wishes
of
the
roman
clergy
and
people
as
well
as
of
the
frankish
magnates
resolved
to
seize
an
occasion
and
place
so
eminently
favourable
to
his
plan
while
charles
carried
away
by
the
enthusiasm
of
the
moment
and
seeing
in
the
pontiff
the
prophet
and
instrument
of
the
divine
will
accepted
a
dignity
which
he
might
have
wished
to
receive
at
some
later
time
or
in
some
other
way
if
therefore
any
positive
conclusion
be
adopted
it
would
seem
to
be
that
charles
although
he
had
probably
given
a
more
or
less
vague
consent
to
the
project
was
surprised
and
disconcerted
by
a
sudden
fulfilment
which
interrupted
his
own
carefully
studied
designs
and
although
a
deed
which
changed
the
history
of
the
world
was
in
any
case
no
accident
it
may
well
have
worn
to
the
frankish
and
roman
spectators
the
air
of
a
surprise
for
there
were
no
preparations
apparent
in
the
church
the
king
was
not
like
his
teutonic
successors
in
aftertime
led
in
procession
to
the
pontifical
throne
suddenly
at
the
very
moment
when
he
rose
from
the
sacred
hollow
where
he
had
knelt
among
the
lamps
before
the
holiest
of
christian
relics
the
body
of
the
prince
of
the
apostles
the
hands
of
that
apostle
representative
placed
upon
his
head
the
crown
of
glory
and
poured
upon
him
the
oil
of
sanctification
there
was
something
in
this
to
thrill
the
beholders
with
the
awe
of
a
divine
presence
and
make
them
hail
him
whom
that
presence
seemed
almost
visibly
to
consecrate
the
and
emperor
crowned
of
god
sidenote
theories
of
the
motives
of
charles
the
reluctance
of
charles
to
assume
the
imperial
title
is
ascribed
by
eginhard
to
a
fear
of
the
jealous
hostility
of
the
greeks
who
could
not
only
deny
his
claim
to
it
but
might
disturb
by
their
intrigues
his
dominions
in
italy
accepting
this
statement
the
problem
remains
how
is
this
reluctance
to
be
reconciled
with
those
acts
of
his
which
clearly
shew
him
aiming
at
the
roman
crown
an
ingenious
and
probable
if
not
certain
solution
is
suggested
by
a
recent
historian
who
argues
from
a
minute
examination
of
the
previous
policy
of
charles
that
while
it
was
the
great
object
of
his
reign
to
obtain
the
crown
of
the
world
he
foresaw
at
the
same
time
the
opposition
of
the
eastern
court
and
the
want
of
legality
from
which
his
title
would
in
consequence
suffer
he
was
therefore
bent
on
getting
from
the
byzantines
if
possible
a
transference
of
their
crown
if
not
at
least
a
recognition
of
his
own
and
he
appears
to
have
hoped
to
win
this
by
the
negotiations
which
had
been
for
some
time
kept
on
foot
with
the
empress
irene
just
at
this
moment
came
the
coronation
by
pope
leo
interrupting
these
schemes
irritating
the
eastern
court
and
forcing
charles
into
the
position
of
a
rival
who
could
not
with
dignity
adopt
a
soothing
or
submissive
tone
nevertheless
he
seems
not
even
then
to
have
abandoned
the
hope
of
obtaining
a
peaceful
recognition
irene
crimes
did
not
prevent
him
if
we
may
credit
theophanes
from
seeking
her
hand
in
marriage
and
when
the
project
of
thus
uniting
the
east
and
west
in
a
single
empire
baffled
for
a
time
by
the
opposition
of
her
minister
ætius
was
rendered
impossible
by
her
subsequent
dethronement
and
exile
he
did
not
abandon
the
policy
of
conciliation
until
a
surly
acquiescence
in
rather
than
admission
of
his
dignity
had
been
won
from
the
byzantine
sovereigns
michael
and
nicephorus
sidenote
defect
in
the
title
of
the
teutonic
emperors
whether
supposing
leo
to
have
been
less
precipitate
a
cession
of
the
crown
or
an
acknowledgment
of
the
right
of
the
romans
to
confer
it
could
ever
have
been
obtained
by
charles
is
perhaps
more
than
doubtful
but
it
is
clear
that
he
judged
rightly
in
rating
its
importance
high
for
the
want
of
it
was
the
great
blemish
in
his
own
and
his
successors
dignity
to
shew
how
this
was
so
reference
must
be
made
to
the
events
of
both
the
extinction
of
the
western
empire
in
that
year
and
its
revival
in
have
been
very
generally
misunderstood
in
modern
times
and
although
the
mistake
is
not
in
a
certain
sense
of
practical
importance
yet
it
tends
to
confuse
history
and
to
blind
us
to
the
ideas
of
the
people
who
acted
on
both
occasions
when
odoacer
compelled
the
abdication
of
romulus
augustulus
he
did
not
abolish
the
western
empire
as
a
separate
power
but
caused
it
to
be
reunited
with
or
sink
into
the
eastern
so
that
from
that
time
there
was
as
there
had
been
before
diocletian
a
single
undivided
roman
empire
in
the
very
memory
of
the
separate
western
empire
as
it
had
stood
from
the
death
of
theodosius
till
odoacer
had
so
far
as
appears
been
long
since
lost
and
neither
leo
nor
charles
nor
any
one
among
their
advisers
dreamt
of
reviving
it
they
too
like
their
predecessors
held
the
roman
empire
to
be
one
and
indivisible
and
proposed
by
the
coronation
of
the
frankish
king
not
to
proclaim
a
severance
of
the
east
and
west
but
to
reverse
the
act
of
constantine
and
make
old
rome
again
the
civil
as
well
as
the
ecclesiastical
capital
of
the
empire
that
bore
her
name
their
deed
was
in
its
essence
illegal
but
they
sought
to
give
it
every
semblance
of
legality
they
professed
and
partly
believed
that
they
were
not
revolting
against
a
reigning
sovereign
but
legitimately
filling
up
the
place
of
the
deposed
constantine
the
sixth
the
people
of
the
imperial
city
exercising
their
ancient
right
of
choice
their
bishop
his
right
of
consecration
their
purpose
was
but
half
accomplished
they
could
create
but
they
could
not
destroy
they
set
up
an
emperor
of
their
own
whose
representatives
thenceforward
ruled
the
west
but
constantinople
retained
her
sovereigns
as
of
yore
and
christendom
saw
henceforth
two
imperial
lines
not
as
in
the
time
before
the
conjoint
heads
of
a
single
realm
but
rivals
and
enemies
each
denouncing
the
other
as
an
impostor
each
professing
to
be
the
only
true
and
lawful
head
of
the
christian
church
and
people
although
therefore
we
must
in
practice
speak
during
the
next
seven
centuries
down
till
when
constantinople
fell
before
the
mohammedan
of
an
eastern
and
a
western
empire
the
phrase
is
in
strictness
incorrect
and
was
one
which
either
court
ought
to
have
repudiated
the
byzantines
always
did
repudiate
it
the
latins
usually
although
yielding
to
facts
they
sometimes
condescended
to
employ
it
themselves
but
their
theory
was
always
the
same
charles
was
held
to
be
the
legitimate
successor
not
of
romulus
augustulus
but
of
basil
heraclius
justinian
arcadius
and
all
the
eastern
line
and
hence
it
is
that
in
all
the
annals
of
the
time
and
of
many
succeeding
centuries
the
name
of
constantine
vi
the
in
order
from
augustus
is
followed
without
a
break
by
that
of
charles
the
sidenote
government
of
charles
as
emperor
sidenote
his
authority
in
matters
ecclesiastical
the
maintenance
of
an
imperial
line
among
the
greeks
was
a
continuing
protest
against
the
validity
of
charles
title
but
from
their
enmity
he
had
little
to
fear
and
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
he
seemed
to
step
into
their
place
adding
the
traditional
dignity
which
had
been
theirs
to
the
power
that
he
already
enjoyed
north
italy
and
rome
ceased
for
ever
to
own
the
supremacy
of
byzantium
and
while
the
eastern
princes
paid
a
shameful
tribute
to
the
mussulman
the
frankish
emperor
as
the
recognised
head
of
christendom
received
from
the
patriarch
of
jerusalem
the
keys
of
the
holy
sepulchre
and
the
banner
of
calvary
the
gift
of
the
sepulchre
itself
says
eginhard
from
aaron
king
of
the
persians
out
of
this
peaceful
intercourse
with
the
great
khalif
the
romancers
created
a
crusade
within
his
own
dominions
his
sway
assumed
a
more
sacred
character
already
had
his
unwearied
and
comprehensive
activity
made
him
throughout
his
reign
an
ecclesiastical
no
less
than
a
civil
ruler
summoning
and
sitting
in
councils
examining
and
appointing
bishops
settling
by
capitularies
the
smallest
points
of
church
discipline
and
polity
a
synod
held
at
frankfort
in
condemned
the
decrees
of
the
second
council
of
nicæa
which
had
been
approved
by
pope
hadrian
censured
in
violent
terms
the
conduct
of
the
byzantine
rulers
in
suggesting
them
and
without
excluding
images
from
churches
altogether
forbade
them
to
be
worshipped
or
even
venerated
not
only
did
charles
preside
in
and
direct
the
deliberations
of
this
synod
although
legates
from
the
pope
were
present
he
also
caused
a
treatise
to
be
drawn
up
stating
and
urging
its
conclusions
he
pressed
hadrian
to
declare
constantine
vi
a
heretic
for
enouncing
doctrines
to
which
hadrian
had
himself
consented
there
are
letters
of
his
extant
in
which
he
lectures
pope
leo
in
a
tone
of
easy
superiority
admonishes
him
to
obey
the
holy
canons
and
bids
him
pray
earnestly
for
the
success
of
the
efforts
which
it
is
the
monarch
duty
to
make
for
the
subjugation
of
pagans
and
the
establishment
of
sound
doctrine
throughout
the
church
nay
subsequent
popes
themselves
admitted
and
applauded
the
despotic
superintendence
of
matters
spiritual
which
he
was
wont
to
exercise
and
which
led
some
one
to
give
him
playfully
a
title
that
had
once
been
applied
to
the
pope
himself
episcoporum
sidenote
the
imperial
office
in
its
ecclesiastical
relations
sidenote
capitulary
of
acting
and
speaking
thus
when
merely
king
it
may
be
thought
that
charles
needed
no
further
title
to
justify
his
power
the
inference
is
in
truth
rather
the
converse
of
this
upon
what
he
had
done
already
the
imperial
title
must
necessarily
follow
the
attitude
of
protection
and
control
which
he
held
towards
the
church
and
the
holy
see
belonged
according
to
the
ideas
of
the
time
especially
and
only
to
an
emperor
therefore
his
coronation
was
the
fitting
completion
and
legitimation
of
his
authority
sanctifying
rather
than
increasing
it
we
have
however
one
remarkable
witness
to
the
importance
that
was
attached
to
the
imperial
name
and
the
enhancement
which
he
conceived
his
office
to
have
received
from
it
in
a
great
assembly
held
at
aachen
the
emperor
revised
the
laws
of
all
the
races
that
obeyed
him
endeavouring
to
harmonize
and
correct
them
and
issued
a
capitulary
singular
in
subject
and
tone
all
persons
within
his
dominions
as
well
ecclesiastical
as
civil
who
have
already
sworn
allegiance
to
him
as
king
are
thereby
commanded
to
swear
to
him
afresh
as
cæsar
and
all
who
have
never
yet
sworn
down
to
the
age
of
twelve
shall
now
take
the
same
oath
the
same
time
it
shall
be
publicly
explained
to
all
what
is
the
force
and
meaning
of
this
oath
and
how
much
more
it
includes
than
a
mere
promise
of
fidelity
to
the
monarch
person
firstly
it
binds
those
who
swear
it
to
live
each
and
every
one
of
them
according
to
his
strength
and
knowledge
in
the
holy
service
of
god
since
the
lord
emperor
can
not
extend
over
all
his
care
and
discipline
secondly
it
binds
them
neither
by
force
nor
fraud
to
seize
or
molest
any
of
the
goods
or
servants
of
his
crown
thirdly
to
do
no
violence
nor
treason
towards
the
holy
church
or
to
widows
or
orphans
or
strangers
seeing
that
the
lord
emperor
has
been
appointed
after
the
lord
and
his
saints
the
protector
and
defender
of
all
such
then
in
similar
fashion
purity
of
life
is
prescribed
to
the
monks
homicide
the
neglect
of
hospitality
and
other
offences
are
denounced
the
notions
of
sin
and
crime
being
intermingled
and
almost
identified
in
a
way
to
which
no
parallel
can
be
found
unless
it
be
in
the
mosaic
code
there
god
the
invisible
object
of
worship
is
also
though
almost
incidentally
the
judge
and
political
ruler
of
israel
here
the
whole
cycle
of
social
and
moral
duty
is
deduced
from
the
obligation
of
obedience
to
the
visible
autocratic
head
of
the
christian
state
in
most
of
charles
words
and
deeds
nor
less
distinctly
in
the
writings
of
his
adviser
alcuin
may
be
discerned
the
working
of
the
same
theocratic
ideas
among
his
intimate
friends
he
chose
to
be
called
by
the
name
of
david
exercising
in
reality
all
the
powers
of
the
jewish
king
presiding
over
this
kingdom
of
god
upon
earth
rather
as
a
second
constantine
or
theodosius
than
in
the
spirit
and
traditions
of
the
julii
or
the
flavii
among
his
measures
there
are
two
which
in
particular
recall
the
first
christian
emperor
as
constantine
founds
so
charles
erects
on
a
firmer
basis
the
connection
of
church
and
state
bishops
and
abbots
are
as
essential
a
part
of
rising
feudalism
as
counts
and
dukes
their
benefices
are
held
under
the
same
conditions
of
fealty
and
the
service
in
war
of
their
vassal
tenants
not
of
the
spiritual
person
himself
they
have
similar
rights
of
jurisdiction
and
are
subject
alike
to
the
imperial
the
monarch
tries
often
to
restrict
the
clergy
as
persons
to
spiritual
duties
quells
the
insubordination
of
the
monasteries
endeavours
to
bring
the
seculars
into

by
instituting

but
after
granting
wealth
and
power
the
attempt
was
vain
his
strong
hand
withdrawn
they
laughed
at
control
again
it
was
by
him
first
that
the
payment
of
tithes
for
which
the
priesthood
had
long
been
pleading
was
made
compulsory
in
western

and

sidenote
action
of
charles
on

in
civil
affairs
also
charles
acquired
with
the
imperial
title
a
new
position
later
jurists
labour
to
distinguish
his
power
as
roman
emperor
from
that
which
he
held
already
as
king
of
the
franks
and
their
subject
allies
they
insist
that
his
coronation
gave
him
the
capital
only
that
it
is
absurd
to
talk
of
a
roman
empire
in
regions
whither
the
eagles
had
never
flown
in
such
expressions
there
seems
to
lurk
either
confusion
or
misconception
it
was
not
the
actual
government
of
the
city
that
charles
obtained
in
that
his
father
had
already
held
as
patrician
and
he
had
constantly
exercised
in
the
same
capacity
it
was
far
more
than
the
titular
sovereignty
of
rome
which
had
hitherto
been
supposed
to
be
vested
in
the
byzantine
princes
it
was
nothing
less
than
the
headship
of
the
world
believed
to
appertain
of
right
to
the
lawful
roman
emperor
whether
he
reigned
on
the
bosphorus
the
tiber
or
the
rhine
as
that
headship
although
never
denied
had
been
in
abeyance
in
the
west
for
several
centuries
its
bestowal
on
the
king
of
so
vast
a
realm
was
a
change
of
the
first
moment
for
it
made
the
coronation
not
merely
a
transference
of
the
seat
of
empire
but
a
renewal
of
the
empire
itself
a
bringing
back
of
it
from
faith
to
sight
from
the
world
of
belief
and
theory
to
the
world
of
fact
and
reality
and
since
the
powers
it
gave
were
autocratic
and
unlimited
it
must
swallow
up
all
minor
claims
and
dignities
the
rights
of
charles
the
frankish
king
were
merged
in
those
of
charles
the
successor
of
augustus
the
lord
of
the
world
that
his
imperial
authority
was
theoretically
irrespective
of
place
is
clear
from
his
own
words
and
acts
and
from
all
the
monuments
of
that
time
he
would
not
indeed
have
dreamed
of
treating
the
free
franks
as
justinian
had
treated
his
subjects
nor
would
the
warriors
who
followed
his
standard
have
brooked
such
an
attempt
yet
even
to
german
eyes
his
position
must
have
been
altered
by
the
halo
of
vague
splendour
which
now
surrounded
him
for
all
even
the
saxon
and
the
slave
had
heard
of
rome
glories
and
revered
the
name
of
cæsar
and
in
his
effort
to
weld
discordant
elements
into
one
body
to
introduce
regular
gradations
of
authority
to
control
the
teutonic
tendency
to
localization
by
his
officials
commissioned
to
traverse
each
some
part
of
his
dominions
reporting
on
and
redressing
the
evils
they
found
and
by
his
own
personal
progresses
charles
was
guided
by
the
traditions
of
the
old
empire
his
sway
is
the
revival
of
order
and
culture
fusing
the
west
into
a
compact
whole
whose
parts
are
never
thenceforward
to
lose
the
marks
of
their
connection
and
their
character
gathering
up
all
that
is
left
in
europe
of
spirit
and
wealth
and
knowledge
and
hurling
it
with
the
new
force
of
christianity
on
the
infidel
of
the
south
and
the
masses
of
untamed
barbarism
to
the
north
and
east
ruling
the
world
by
the
gift
of
god
and
the
transmitted
rights
of
the
romans
and
their
cæsar
whom
god
had
chosen
to
conquer
it
he
renews
the
original
aggressive
movement
of
the
empire
the
civilized
world
has
subdued
her
invader
and
now
arms
him
against
savagery
and
heathendom
hence
the

not
more
of
the

than
of
the
cross
against
saxons
avars
slaves
danes

where
monasteries
are
fortresses
and
baptism
the
badge
of
submission
the
overthrow
of
the
irminsûl
in
the
first
saxon
campaign
sums
up
the
changes
of
seven
centuries
the
romanized
teuton
destroys
the
monument
of
his
country
freedom
for
it
is
also
the
emblem
of
paganism
and
barbarism
the
work
of
arminius
is
undone
by
his
successor
sidenote
his
position
as
frankish
king
this
however
is
not
the
only
side
from
which
charles
policy
and
character
may
be
regarded
if
the
unity
of
the
church
and
the
shadow
of
imperial
prerogative
was
one
pillar
of
his
power
the
other
was
the
frankish
nation
the
empire
was
still
military
though
in
a
sense
strangely
different
from
that
of
julius
or
severus
the
warlike
franks
had
permeated
western
europe
their
primacy
was
admitted
by
the
kindred

his
influence
if
not
his
exerted
power
crossed
the

the

of
the
scots
sent
gifts
and
called
him
lord
the
restoration
of
eardulf
to
northumbria
still
more
of
egbert
to
wessex
might
furnish
a
better
ground
for
the
claim
of
suzerainty
than
many
to
which
his
successors
had
afterwards
recourse
as
it
was
by
frankish
arms
that
this
predominance
in
europe
which
the
imperial
title
adorned
and
legalized
had
been
won
so
was
the
government
of
charles
roman
in
semblance
rather
than
in
fact
it
was
not
by
restoring
the
effete
mechanism
of
the
old
empire
but
by
his
own
vigorous
personal
action
and
that
of
his
great
officers
that
he
strove
to
administer
and
reform
with
every
effort
for
a
strong
central
government
there
is
no
despotism
each
nation
retains
its
laws
its
hereditary
chiefs
its
free
popular
assemblies
the
conditions
granted
to
the
saxons
after
such
cruel
warfare
conditions
so
favourable
that
in
the
next
century
their
dukes
hold
the
foremost
place
in

how
little
he
desired
to
make
the
franks
a
dominant
caste
sidenote
general
results
of
his
empire
he
repeats
the
attempt
of
theodoric
to
breathe
a
teutonic
spirit
into
roman
forms
the
conception
was
magnificent
great
results
followed
its
partial
execution
two
causes
forbade
success
the
one
was
the
ecclesiastical
especially
the
papal
power
apparently
subject
to
the
temporal
but
with
a
strong
and
undefined
prerogative
which
only
waited
the
occasion
to
trample
on
what
it
had
helped
to
raise
the
pope
might
take
away
the
crown
he
had
bestowed
and
turn
against
the
emperor
the
church
which
now
obeyed
him
the
other
was
to
be
found
in
the
discordance
of
the
component
parts
of
the
empire
the
nations
were
not
ripe
for
settled
life
or
extensive
schemes
of
polity
the
differences
of
race
language
manners
over
vast
and
lands
baffled
every
attempt
to
maintain
their
connection
and
when
once
the
spell
of
the
great
mind
was
withdrawn
the
mutually
repellent
forces
began
to
work
and
the
mass
dissolved
into
that
chaos
out
of
which
it
had
been
formed
nevertheless
the
parts
separated
not
as
they
met
but
having
all
of
them
undergone
influences
which
continued
to
act
when
political
connection
had
ceased
for
the
work
of
charles
a
genius
creative
was
not
lost
in
the
anarchy
that
followed
rather
are
we
to
regard
his
reign
as
the
beginning
of
a
new
era
or
as
laying
the
foundations
whereon
men
continued
for
many
generations
to
build
sidenote
personal
habits
and
sympathies
no
claim
can
be
more
groundless
than
that
which
the
modern
french
the
sons
of
the
latinized
kelt
set
up
to
the
teutonic
charles
at
rome
he
might
assume
the
chlamys
and
the
sandals
but
at
the
head
of
his
frankish
host
he
strictly
adhered
to
the
customs
of
his
country
and
was
beloved
by
his
people
as
the
very
ideal
of
their
own
character
and
habits
of

and

generally
there
were
in
his

as
in
his
own
mind
two
elements
those
two
from
the
union
and
mutual
action
and
reaction
of
which
modern
civilization
has
arisen
these
vast
domains
reaching
from
the
ebro
to
the
carpathian
mountains
from
the
eyder
to
the
liris
were
all
the
conquests
of
the
frankish
sword
and
were
still
governed
almost
exclusively
by
viceroys
and
officers
of
frankish
blood
but
the
conception
of
the
empire
that
which
made
it
a
state
and
not
a
mere
mass
of
subject
tribes
like
those
great
eastern
dominions
which
rise
and
perish
in
a
lifetime
the
realms
of
sesostris
or
attila
or

was
inherited
from
an
older
and
a
grander
system
was
not
teutonic
but
roman
roman
in
its
ordered
rule
in
its
uniformity
and
precision
in
its
endeavour
to
subject
the
individual
to
the
system
roman
in
its
effort
to
realize
a
certain
limited
and
human
perfection
whose
very
completeness
shall
exclude
the
hope
of
further
progress
and
the
bond
too
by
which
the
empire
was
held
together
was
roman
in
its
origin
although
roman
in
a
sense
which
would
have
surprised
trajan
or
severus
could
it
have
been
foretold
them
the
ecclesiastical
body
was
already
organized
and
centralized
and
it
was
in
his
rule
over
the
ecclesiastical
body
that
the
secret
of
power
lay
every
christian
frank
gaul
or
italian
owed
loyalty
to
the
head
and
defender
of
his
religion
the
unity
of
the
empire
was
a
reflection
of
the
unity
of
the
church
into
a
general
view
of
the
government
and
policy
of
charles
it
is
not
possible
here
to
enter
yet
his
legislation
his
assemblies
his
administrative
system
his
magnificent
works
recalling
the
projects
of
alexander
and
cæsar
the
zeal
for
education
and
literature
which
he
shewed
in
the
collection
of
manuscripts
the
founding
of
schools
the
gathering
of
eminent
men
from
all
quarters
around
him
can
not
be
appreciated
apart
from
his
position
as
restorer
of
the
roman
empire
like
all
the
foremost
men
of
our
race
charles
was
all
great
things
in
one
and
was
so
great
just
because
the
workings
of
his
genius
were
so
harmonious
he
was
not
a
mere
barbarian
warrior
any
more
than
he
was
an
astute
diplomatist
there
is
none
of
all
his
qualities
which
would
not
be
forced
out
of
its
place
were
we
to
characterize
him
chiefly
by
it
comparisons
between
famous
men
of
different
ages
are
generally
as
worthless
as
they
are
easy
the
circumstances
among
which
charles
lived
do
not
permit
us
to
institute
a
minute
parallel
between
his
greatness
and
that
of
those
two
to
whom
it
is
the
modern
fashion
to
compare
him
nor
to
say
whether
he
was
or
could
have
become
as
profound
a
politician
as
cæsar
as
skilful
a
commander
as
napoleon
but
neither
to
the
roman
nor
to
the
corsican
was
he
inferior
in
that
one
quality
by
which
both
he
and
they
chiefly
impress
our
imaginations
that
intense
vivid
unresting
energy
which
swept
him
over
europe
in
campaign
after
campaign
which
sought
a
field
for
its
workings
in
theology
science
literature
no
less
than
in
politics
and
war
as
it
was
this
wondrous
activity
that
made
him
the
conqueror
of
europe
so
was
it
by
the
variety
of
his
culture
that
he
became
her
civilizer
from
him
in
whose
wide
deep
mind
the
whole
mediæval
theory
of
the
world

human
life
mirrored
itself

take
the

which
it

the
traces
whereof
are

great

usually
considered
by

not
a

rather
a
second

something
must
be
said
of

as
having
been
it
was
not
meant

settle

there
was
but
an
extension
of
that
principle
of
the
equality
of
all

which
had
made

it

by
no

though
they
might
think

it
had
passed
to
their

only
because

was
the

the

akin
rather
to

their

it
might
soon
have
become

a
vigorous
rule
which
should
have
organized
it

knit
it
together

resist
attacks
from

therefore
the
attempt
to
establish
such

is
remarkable
for
it

have

before

that

were
the

the

his
ardent

and
successful
struggle
against
the
turbulent
magnates
of

engaged

held
themselves
in
every
way
the
true

accounted
the

nothing
but
an
interregnum

had
suspended

not
impaired
their

the

therefore
to

righteous
as

sidenote
why
the
revival
of
the
empire
was
desired
these
were
the
events
and
circumstances
of
the
time
let
us
now
look
at
the
causes
the
restoration
of
the
empire
by
charles
may
seem
to
be
sufficiently
accounted
for
by
the
width
of
his
conquests
by
the
peculiar
connection
which
already
subsisted
between
him
and
the
roman
church
by
his
commanding
personal
character
by
the
temporary
vacancy
of
the
byzantine
throne
the
causes
of
its
revival
under
otto
must
be
sought
deeper
making
every
allowance
for
the
favouring
incidents
which
have
already
been
dwelt
upon
there
must
have
been
some
further
influence
at
work
to
draw
him
and
his
successors
saxon
and
frankish
kings
so
far
from
home
in
pursuit
of
a
barren
crown
to
lead
the
italians
to
accept
the
dominion
of
a
stranger
and
a
barbarian
to
make
the
empire
itself
appear
through
the
whole
middle
age
not
what
it
seems
now
a
gorgeous
anachronism
but
an
institution
divine
and
necessary
having
its
foundations
in
the
very
nature
and
order
of
things
the
empire
of
the
elder
rome
had
been
splendid
in
its
life
yet
its
judgment
was
written
in
the
misery
to
which
it
had
brought
the
provinces
and
the
helplessness
that
had
invited
the
attacks
of
the
barbarian
now
as
we
at
least
can
see
it
had
long
been
dead
and
the
course
of
events
was
adverse
to
its
revival
its
actual
representatives
the
roman
people
were
a
turbulent
rabble
sunk
in
a
profligacy
notorious
even
in
that
guilty
age
yet
not
the
less
for
all
this
did
men
cling
to
the
idea
and
strive
through
long
ages
to
stem
the
irresistible
fondly
believing
that
they
were
breasting
it
even
while
it
was
sweeping
them
ever
faster
and
faster
away
from
the
old
order
into
a
region
of
new
thoughts
new
feelings
new
forms
of
life
not
till
the
days
of
the
reformation
was
the
illusion
dispelled
sidenote
mediæval
theories
the
explanation
is
to
be
found
in
the
state
of
the
human
mind
during
these
centuries
the
middle
ages
were
essentially
unpolitical
ideas
as
familiar
to
the
commonwealths
of
antiquity
as
to
ourselves
ideas
of
the
common
good
as
the
object
of
the
state
of
the
rights
of
the
people
of
the
comparative
merits
of
different
forms
of
government
were
to
them
though
sometimes
carried
out
in
fact
in
their
speculative
form
unknown
perhaps
incomprehensible
feudalism
was
the
one
great
institution
to
which
those
times
gave
birth
and
feudalism
was
a
social
and
a
legal
system
only
indirectly
and
by
consequence
a
political
one
yet
the
human
mind
so
far
from
being
idle
was
in
certain
directions
never
more
active
nor
was
it
possible
for
it
to
remain
without
general
conceptions
regarding
the
relation
of
men
to
each
other
in
this
world
such
conceptions
were
neither
made
an
expression
of
the
actual
present
condition
of
things
nor
drawn
from
an
induction
of
the
past
they
were
partly
inherited
from
the
system
that
had
preceded
partly
evolved
from
the
principles
of
that
metaphysical
theology
which
was
ripening
into
scholasticism
now
the
two
great
ideas
which
expiring
antiquity
bequeathed
to
the
ages
that
followed
were
those
of
a
and
a
sidenote
the
before
the
conquests
of
rome
men
with
little
knowledge
of
each
other
with
no
experience
of
wide
political
union
had
held
differences
of
race
to
be
natural
and
irremovable
barriers
similarly
religion
appeared
to
them
a
matter
purely
local
and
national
and
as
there
were
gods
of
the
hills
and
gods
of
the
valleys
of
the
land
and
of
the
sea
so
each
tribe
rejoiced
in
its
peculiar
deities
looking
on
the
natives
of
another
country
who
worshipped
other
gods
as
gentiles
natural
foes
unclean
beings
such
feelings
if
keenest
in
the
east

shew
themselves
in
the
early
records
of

and

of

expressions
of

belief
which
made

on
a

of

between

and

as
natural
and

on

original
diversity
of
the
races

rule
and

that
serve

giving
to
many
nations
a
common
speech
and

smote
this
feeling
on
its
political
side
christianity
more
effectually
banished
it
from
the
soul
by
substituting
for
the
variety
of
local
pantheons
the
belief
in
one
god
before
whom
all
men
are
equal
sidenote
coincides
with
the
it
is
on
the
religious
life
that
nations
repose

was

of

had
hitherto

unities
that
of

and
that
of

society
meeting
in
the
higher
unity
of
all
christians
which
may
be
indifferently
called
catholicity
or
romanism
since
in
that
day
those
words
would
have
had
the
same
meaning
that
only
which
had
been
entrusted
to
the
keeping
of
the
church
survived
the
storms
of
the
fifth
century
many
reasons
may
be
assigned
for
the
firmness
with
which
she
clung
to
it
seeing
one
institution
after
another
falling
to
pieces
around
her
seeing
how
countries
and
cities
were
being
severed
from
each
other
by
the
irruption
of
strange
tribes
and
the
increasing
difficulty
of
communication
she
strove
to
save
religious
fellowship
by
strengthening
the
ecclesiastical
organization
by
drawing
tighter
every
bond
of
outward
union
necessities
of
faith
were
still
more
powerful
truth
it
was
said
is
one
and
as
it
must
bind
into
one
body
all
who
hold
it
so
it
is
only
by
continuing
in
that
body
that
they
can
preserve
it
thus
with
the
growing
rigidity
of
dogma
which
may
be
traced
from
the
council
of
jerusalem
to
the
council
of
trent
there
had
arisen
the
idea
of
supplementing
revelation
by
tradition
as
a
source
of
doctrine
of
exalting
the
universal
conscience
and
belief
above
the
individual
and
allowing
the
soul
to
approach
god
only
through
the
universal
consciousness
represented
by
the
sacerdotal
order
principles
still
maintained
by
one
branch
of
the
church
and
for
some
at
least
of
which
far
weightier
reasons
could
be
assigned
then
in
the
paucity
of
written
records
and
the
blind
ignorance
of
the
mass
of
the
people
than
any
to
which
their
modern
advocates
have
recourse
there
was
another
cause
yet
more
deeply
seated
and
which
it
is
hard
adequately
to
describe
it
was
not
exactly
a
want
of
faith
in
the
unseen
nor
a
shrinking
fear
which
dared
not
look
forth
on
the
universe
alone
it
was
rather
the
powerlessness
of
the
untrained
mind
to
realize
the
idea
as
an
idea
and
live
in
it
it
was
the
tendency
to
see
everything
in
the
concrete
to
turn
the
parable
into
a
fact
the
doctrine
into
its
most
literal
application
the
symbol
into
the
essential
ceremony
the
tendency
which
intruded
earthly
madonnas
and
saints
between
the
worshipper
and
the
spiritual
deity
and
could
satisfy
its
devotional
feelings
only
by
visible
images
even
of
these
which
conceived
of
man
aspirations
and
temptations
as
the
result
of
the
direct
action
of
angels
and
devils
which
expressed
the
strivings
of
the
soul
after
purity
by
the
search
for
the
holy
grail
which
in
the
crusades
sent
myriads
to
win
at
jerusalem
by
earthly
arms
the
sepulchre
of
him
whom
they
could
not
serve
in
their
own
spirit
nor
approach
by
their
own
prayers
and
therefore
it
was
that
the
whole
fabric
of
mediæval
christianity
rested
upon
the
idea
of
the
visible
church
such
a
church
could
be
in
nowise
local
or
limited
to
acquiesce
in
the
establishment
of
national
churches
would
have
appeared
to
those
men
as
it
must
always
appear
when
scrutinized
contradictory
to
the
nature
of
a
religious
body
opposed
to
the
genius
of
christianity
defensible
when
capable
of
defence

all

as
a
temporary
resource

the
presence

insuperable
difficulties

this
plan
on
which
so
many
have
dwelt
with
complacency
in
later
times
been
proposed
either
to
the
primitive
church
in
its
adversity
or
to
the
dominant
church
of
the
ninth
century
it
would
have
been
rejected
with
horror
but
since
there
were
as
yet
no
nations
the
plan
was
one
which
did
not
and
could
not
present
itself
the
visible
church
was
therefore
the
church

the

whereof
mention
has

preserved

a
matter

state
had
perished
out
of
the

might

let

however
did
not
so

opposed

the
civil
authority
in
the
seventh
and
eighth
centuries
as
they
came
to
do
in

by
them
chiefly
was
that
idea
expounded
and
enforced
for
many
generations
by
none
more
earnestly

by

had
a

and
may
be
traced
up
to
those
metaphysical
ideas
out
of
which
the

we
call

developed
itself
the

to
be
that
which
was
most
desirable

as
in
life

became
a
search
after
principles
of
classification

simplicity
and
truth
were
held
to
consist
not
in
an
analysis
of
thought
into
its
elements
nor
in
an
observation
of

as
we
have

a
thought
could
then
be
apprehended

it
was
to
unity

the

was
both
by
doctrine
and

found
this
inseparable
from
the

unity

politics
they
saw
that
every
act
of
man
has
a
social
and
public
as
well
as
a
moral
and
personal
bearing
and
concluded
that
the
rules
which
directed
and
the
powers
which
rewarded
or
punished
must
be
parallel
and
similar
not
so
much
two
powers
as
different
manifestations
of
one

souls
of
all
christian
men
should
be

for

they

until
by
the
middle
of
the
eighth
or
at
latest
of

ninth
century
she

a
scheme
which
made
her
the
exact
counterpart
of
the
departed
despotism
the

of

absolute
mistress
of
the

the
character
of
that
scheme
is
best
set
forth
in
the
singular
document
most
stupendous
of
all
the
mediæval
forgeries
which
under
the
name
of
the
donation
of
constantine
commanded
for
seven
centuries
the
unquestioning
belief
of
mankind
itself
a
portentous
falsehood
it
is
the
most
unimpeachable
evidence
of
the
thoughts
and
beliefs
of
the
priesthood
which
framed
it
some
time
between
the
middle
of
the
eighth
and
the
middle
of
the
tenth
century
it
tells
how
constantine
the
great
cured
of
his
leprosy
by
the
prayers
of
sylvester
resolved
on
the
fourth
day
from
his
baptism
to
forsake
the
ancient
seat
for
a
new
capital
on
the
bosphorus
lest
the
continuance
of
the
secular
government
should
cramp
the
freedom
of
the
spiritual
and
how
he
bestowed
therewith
upon
the
pope
and
his
successors
the
sovereignty
over
italy
and
the
countries
of
the
west
but
this
is
not
all
although
this
is
what
historians
in
admiration
of
its
splendid
audacity
have
chiefly
dwelt
upon
the
edict
proceeds
to
grant
to
the
roman
pontiff
and
his
clergy
a
series
of
dignities
and
privileges
all
of
them
enjoyed
by
the
emperor
and
his
senate
all
of
them
shewing
the
same
desire
to
make
the
pontifical
a
copy
of
the
imperial
office
the
pope
is
to
inhabit
the
lateran
palace
to
wear
the
diadem
the
collar
the
purple
cloak
to
carry
the
sceptre
and
to
be
attended
by
a
body
of
chamberlains
similarly
his
clergy
are
to
ride
on
white
horses
and
receive
the
honours
and
immunities
of
the
senate
and
patricians
sidenote
interdependence
of
papacy
and
empire
the
notion
which
prevails
throughout
that
the
chief
of
the
religious
society
must
be
in
every
point
conformed
to
his
prototype
the
chief
of
the
civil
is
the
key
to
all
the
thoughts
and
acts
of
the
roman
clergy
not
less
plainly
seen
in
the
details
of
papal
ceremonial
than
it
is
in
the
gigantic
scheme
of
papal
legislation
the
canon
law
was
intended
by
its
authors
to
reproduce
and
rival
the
imperial
jurisprudence
a
correspondence
was
traced
between
its
divisions
and
those
of
the
corpus
juris
civilis
and
gregory
ix
who
was
the
first
to
consolidate
it
into
a
code
sought
the
fame
and
received
the
title
of
the
justinian
of
the
church
but
the
wish
of
the
clergy
was
always
even
in
the
weakness
or
hostility
of
the
temporal
power
to
imitate
and
rival
not
to
supersede
it
since
they
held
it
the
necessary
complement
of
their
own
and
thought
the
christian
people
equally
imperilled
by
the
fall
of
either
hence
the
reluctance
of
gregory
ii
to
break
with
the
byzantine
princes
and
the
maintenance
of
their
titular
sovereignty
till
hence
the
part
which
the
holy
see
played
in
transferring
the
crown
to
charles
the
first
sovereign
of
the
west
capable
of
fulfilling
its
duties
hence
the
grief
with
which
its
weakness
under
his
successors
was
seen
the
gladness
when
it
descended
to
otto
as
representative
of
the
frankish
kingdom
sidenote
the
roman
empire
revived
in
a
new
character
up
to
the
era
of
there
had
been
at
constantinople
a
legitimate
historical
prolongation
of
the
roman
empire
technically
as
we
have
seen
the
election
of
charles
after
the
deposition
of
constantine
vi
was
itself
a
prolongation
and
maintained
the
old
rights
and
forms
in
their
integrity
but
the
pope
though
he
knew
it
not
did
far
more
than
effect
a
change
of
dynasty
when
he
rejected
irene
and
crowned
the
barbarian
chief
restorations
are
always
delusive
as
well
might
one
hope
to
stop
the
earth
course
in
her
orbit
as
to
arrest
that
ceaseless
change
and
movement
in
human
affairs
which
forbids
an
old
institution
suddenly
transplanted
into
a
new
order
of
things
from
filling
its
ancient
place
and
serving
its
former
ends
the
dictatorship
at
rome
in
the
second
punic
war
was
not
more
unlike
the
dictatorships
of
sulla
and
cæsar
nor
the
of
louis
xiii
to
the
assembly
which
his
unhappy
descendant
convoked
in
than
was
the
imperial
office
of
theodosius
to
that
of
charles
the
frank
and
the
seal
ascribed
to
which
bears
the
legend
romani
imperii
expresses
more
justly
perhaps
than
was
intended
by
its
author
a
second
birth
of
the
roman
empire
it
is
not
however
from
carolingian
times
that
a
proper
view
of
this
new
creation
can
be
formed
that
period
was
one
of
transition
of
fluctuation
and
uncertainty
in
which
the
office
passing
from
one
dynasty
and
country
to
another
had
not
time
to
acquire
a
settled
character
and
claims
and
was
without
the
power
that
would
have
enabled
it
to
support
them
from
the
coronation
of
otto
the
great
a
new
period
begins
in
which
the
ideas
that
have
been
described
as
floating
in
men
minds
took
clearer
shape
and
attached
to
the
imperial
title
a
body
of
definite
rights
and
definite
duties
it
is
this
new
phase
the
holy
empire
that
we
have
now
to
consider
sidenote
position
and
functions
of
the
emperor
sidenote
correspondence
and
harmony
of
the
spiritual
and
temporal
powers
the
realistic
philosophy
and
the
needs
of
a
time
when
the
only
notion
of
civil
or
religious
order
was
submission
to
authority
required
the
to
be
a
monarchy
tradition
as
well
as
the
continuance
of
certain
institutions
gave
the
monarch
the
name
of
roman
emperor
a
king
could
not
be
universal
sovereign
for
there
were
many
kings
the
emperor
must
be
for
there
had
never
been
but
one
emperor
he
had
in
older
and
brighter
days
been
the
actual
lord
of
the
civilized
world
the
seat
of
his
power
was
placed
beside
that
of
the
spiritual
autocrat
of
christendom
his
functions
will
be
seen
most
clearly
if
we
deduce
them
from
the
leading
principle
of
mediæval
mythology
the
exact
correspondence
of
earth
and
heaven
as
god
in
the
midst
of
the
celestial
hierarchy
ruled
blessed
spirits
in
paradise
so
the
pope
his
vicar
raised
above
priests
bishops
metropolitans
reigned
over
the
souls
of
mortal
men
below
but
as
god
is
lord
of
earth
as
well
as
of
heaven
so
must
he
the
t
be
represented
by
a
second
earthly
viceroy
the
emperor
whose
authority
shall
be
of
and
for
this
present
life
and
as
in
this
present
world
the
soul
can
not
act
save
through
the
body
while
yet
the
body
is
no
more
than
an
instrument
and
means
for
the
manifestation
so
must
there
be
a
rule
and
care
of
men
bodies
as
well
as
of
their
souls
yet
subordinated
always
to
the
of
that
which
is
the
purer
and
the
more
enduring
it
is
under
the
emblem
of
soul
and
body
that
the
relation
of
the
papal
and
imperial
power
is
presented
to
us
throughout
the
middle
ages
the
pope
as
vicar
in
matters
spiritual
is
to
lead
men
to
eternal
life
the
emperor
as
vicar
in
matters
temporal
must
so
control
them
in
their
dealings
with
one
another
that
they
may
be
able
to
pursue
undisturbed
the
spiritual
life
and
thereby
attain
the
same
supreme
and
common
end
of
everlasting
happiness
in
the
view
of
this
object
his
chief
duty
is
to
maintain
peace
in
the
world
while
towards
the
church
his
position
is
that
of
advocate
a
title
borrowed
from
the
practice
adopted
by
churches
and
monasteries
of
choosing
some
powerful
baron
to
protect
their
lands
and
lead
their
tenants
in
war
the
functions
of
advocacy
are
twofold
at
home
to
make
the
christian
people
obedient
to
the
priesthood
and
to
execute
their
decrees
upon
heretics
and
sinners
abroad
to
propagate
the
faith
among
the
heathen
not
sparing
to
use
carnal
weapons
thus
does
the
emperor
answer
in
every
point
to
his
antitype
the
pope
his
power
being
yet
of
a
lower
rank
created
on
the
analogy
of
the
papal
as
the
papal
itself
had
been
modelled
after
the
elder
empire
the
parallel
holds
good
even
in
its
details
for
just
as
we
have
seen
the
churchman
assuming
the
crown
and
robes
of
the
secular
prince
so
now
did
he
array
the
emperor
in
his
own
ecclesiastical
vestments
the
stole
and
the
dalmatic
gave
him
a
clerical
as
well
as
a
sacred
character
removed
his
office
from
all
narrowing
associations
of
birth
or
country
inaugurated
him
by
rites
every
one
of
which
was
meant
to
symbolize
and
enjoin
duties
in
their
essence
religious
thus
the
holy
roman
church
and
the
holy
roman
empire
are
one
and
the
same
thing
in
two
aspects
and
catholicism
the
principle
of
the
universal
christian
society
is
also
romanism
that
is
rests
upon
rome
as
the
origin
and
type
of
its
universality
manifesting
itself
in
a
mystic
dualism
which
corresponds
to
the
two
natures
of
its
founder
as
divine
and
eternal
its
head
is
the
pope
to
whom
souls
have
been
entrusted
as
human
and
temporal
the
emperor
commissioned
to
rule
men
bodies
and
acts
sidenote
union
of
church
and
state
in
nature
and
compass
the
government
of
these
two
potentates
is
the
same
differing
only
in
the
sphere
of
its
working
and
it
matters
not
whether
we
call
the
pope
a
spiritual
emperor
or
the
emperor
a
secular
pope
nor
though
the
one
office
is
below
the
other
as
far
as
life
on
earth
is
less
precious
than
his
life
hereafter
is
therefore
on
the
older
and
truer
theory
the
imperial
authority
delegated
by
the
papal
for
as
has
been
said
already
god
is
represented
by
the
pope
not
in
every
capacity
but
only
as
the
ruler
of
spirits
in
heaven
as
sovereign
of
earth
he
issues
his
commission
directly
to
the
emperor
opposition
between
two
servants
of
the
same
king
is
inconceivable
each
being
bound
to
aid
and
foster
the
other
the
of
both
being
needed
in
all
that
concerns
the
welfare
of
christendom
at
large
this
is
the
one
perfect
and
scheme
of
the
union
of
church
and
state
for
taking
the
absolute
coincidence
of
their
limits
to
be
it
assumes
the
infallibility
of
their
joint
government
and
derives
as
a
corollary
from
that
infallibility
the
duty
of
the
civil
magistrate
to
root
out
heresy
and
schism
no
less
than
to
punish
treason
and
rebellion
it
is
also
the
scheme
which
granting
the
possibility
of
their
harmonious
action
places
the
two
powers
in
that
relation
which
gives
each
of
them
its
maximum
of
strength
but
by
a
law
to
which
it
would
be
hard
to
find
exceptions
in
proportion
as
the
state
became
more
christian
the
church
who
to
work
out
her
purposes
had
assumed
worldly
forms
became
by
the
contact
worldlier
meaner
spiritually
weaker
and
the
system
which
constantine
founded
amid
such
rejoicings
which
culminated
so
triumphantly
in
the
empire
church
of
the
middle
ages
has
in
each
succeeding
generation
been
slowly
losing
ground
has
seen
its
brightness
dimmed
and
its
completeness
marred
and
sees
now
those
who
are
most
zealous
on
behalf
of
its
surviving
institutions
feebly
defend
or
silently
desert
the
principle
upon
which
all
must
rest
the
complete
accord
of
the
papal
and
imperial
powers
which
this
theory
as
sublime
as
it
is
impracticable
requires
was
attained
only
at
a
few
points
in
their
history
it
was
finally
supplanted
by
another
view
of
their
relation
which
professing
to
be
a
development
of
a
principle
recognized
as
fundamental
the
superior
importance
of
the
religious
life
found
increasing
favour
in
the
eyes
of
fervent
churchmen
declaring
the
pope
sole
representative
on
earth
of
the
deity
it
concluded
that
from
him
and
not
directly
from
god
must
the
empire
be
held
held
feudally
it
was
said
by
many
and
it
thereby
thrust
down
the
temporal
power

the
fifteenth
nor
need
it
surprise
us
that
we
do
not
find
in
any
one
author
a
statement
of
the
grounds
whereon
it
rested
since
much
of
what
seems

to
us
was
then
too
obvious
to
be
formally
explained
no
one
however
who
examines
mediæval
writings
can
fail
to
perceive
sometimes
from
direct
words
oftener
from
allusions
or
assumptions
that
such
ideas
as
these
are
present
to
the
minds
of
the
authors
that
which
it
is
easiest
to
prove

of
the

with
religion

faith

the

proved
from

very
singular
are
the
reasonings
used
by
which
the
necessity
and
divine
right
of
the
empire
are
proved
out
of
the
bible
the
mediæval
theory
of
the
relation
of
the
civil
power
to
the
priestly
was
profoundly
influenced
by
the
account
in
the
old
testament
of
the
jewish
theocracy
in
which
the
king
though
the
institution
of
his
office
was
a
derogation
from
the
purity
of
the
older
system
appears
divinely
chosen
and
commissioned
and
stood
in
a
peculiarly
intimate
relation
to
the
national
religion
from
the
new
testament
the
authority
and
eternity
of
rome
herself
was
established
every
passage
was
seized
on
where
submission
to
the
powers
that
be
is
enjoined
every
instance
cited
where
obedience
had
actually
been
rendered
to
imperial
officials
a
special
emphasis
being
laid
on
the
sanction
which
christ
himself
had
given
to
roman
dominion
by
pacifying
the
world
through
augustus
by
being
born
at
the
time
of
the
taxing
by
paying
tribute
to

by

from

more
attractive
to
the
mystical
spirit
than
these
direct
arguments
were
those
drawn
from
prophecy
or
based
on
the
allegorical
interpretation
of
scripture
very
early
in
christian
history
had
the
belief
formed
itself
that
the
roman
empire
as
the
fourth
beast
of
daniel
vision
as
the
iron
legs
and
feet
of
image
was
to
be
the
world
last
and
universal
kingdom
from
origen
and
jerome
downwards
it
found
unquestioned
acceptance
and
that
not
unnaturally
for
no
new
power
had
arisen
to
extinguish
the
roman
as
the
persian
monarchy
had
been
blotted
out
by
alexander
as
the
realms
of
his
successors
had
fallen

the
conquering
republic

every
northern
conqueror
goth

had
cherished
her
memory

preserved
her

germany
had
adopted
even
the
name
of

and
terrible
and
strong
exceedingly
and
diverse
from
all
that
were
before
it
to
these
predictions
and
to
many
others
from
the
apocalypse
were
added
those
which
in
the
gospels
and
epistles
foretold
the
advent
of
antichrist
he
was
to
succeed
the
roman
dominion
and
the
popes
are
more
than
once
warned
that
by
weakening
the
empire
they
are
hastening
the
coming
of
the
enemy
and
the
end
of
the
world
it
is
not
only
when
groping
in
the
dark
labyrinths
of
prophecy
that
mediæval
authors
are
quick
in
detecting
emblems
imaginative
in
explaining
them
men
were
wont
in
those
days
to
interpret
scripture
in
a
singular
fashion
not
only
did
it
not
occur
to
them
to
ask
what
meaning
words
had
to
those
to
whom
they
were
originally
addressed
they
were
quite
as
careless
whether
the
sense
they
discovered
was
one
which
the
language
used
would
naturally
and
rationally
bear
to
any
reader
at
any
time
no
analogy
was
too
faint
no
allegory
too
fanciful
to
be
drawn
out
of
a
simple
text
and
once
propounded
the
interpretation
acquired
in
argument
all
the
authority
of
the
text
itself
thus
the
two
swords
of
which
christ
said
is
enough
became
the
spiritual
and
temporal
powers
and
the
grant
of
the
spiritual
to
peter
involves
the
supremacy
of
the
papacy
thus
one
writer
proves
the
eternity
of
rome
from
the
psalm

fear
thee
as
long
as
the

and

endure

holding

were
all

only

begin
to
fancy
that

illustrations
from
mediæval
art
it
would
be
a
task
both
pleasant
and
profitable
to
pass
on
from
the
theologians
to
the
poets
and
artists
of
the
middle
ages
and
endeavour
to
trace
through
their
works
the
influence
of
the
ideas
which
have
been
expounded
above
but
it
is
one
far
too
wide
for
the
scope
of
the
present
treatise
and
one
which
would
demand
an
acquaintance
with
those
works
themselves
such
as
only
minute
and
study
could
give
for
even
a
slight
knowledge
enables
any
one
to
see
how
much
still
remains
to
be
interpreted
in
the
imaginative
literature
and
in
the
paintings
of
those
times
and
how
apt
we
are
in
glancing
over
a
piece
of
work
to
miss
those
seemingly
trifling
indications
of
the
artist
thought
or
belief
which
are
all
the
more
precious
that
they
are
indirect
or
unconscious
therefore
a
history
of
mediæval
art
which
shall
evolve
its
philosophy
from
its
concrete
forms
if
it
is
to
have
any
value
at
all
must
be
minute
in
description
as
well
as
subtle
in
method
but
lest
this
class
of
illustrations
should
appear
to
have
been
wholly
forgotten
it
may
be
well
to
mention
here
two
paintings
in
which
the
theory
of
the
mediæval
empire
is
unmistakeably
set
forth
one
of
them

other

known
as

character

here
too
there
needs
no
comment
the

militant
is
the
perfect
counterpart
of
the
church
triumphant
her
chief
danger
is
from
those
who
would
rend
the
unity
of
her
visible
body
the
seamless
garment
of
her
heavenly
lord
and
that
devotion
to
his
person
which
is
the
sum
of
her
faith
and
the
essence
of
her
being
must
on
earth
be
rendered
to
those
two
lieutenants
whom
he
has
chosen
to
govern
in
his
name
a
theory
such
as
that
which
it
has
been
attempted
to
explain
and
illustrate
is
utterly
opposed
to
restrictions
of
place
or
person
the
idea
of
one
christian
people
all
whose
members
are
equal
in
the
sight
of
god
an
idea
so
forcibly
expressed
in
the
unity
of
the
priesthood
where
no
barrier
separated
the
successor
of
the
apostle
from
the
humblest
curate
and
in
the
prevalence
of
one
language
for
worship
and
government
made
the
post
of
emperor
independent
of
the
race
or
rank
or
actual
resources
of
its
occupant
the
emperor
was
entitled
to
the
obedience
of
christendom
not
as
hereditary
chief
of
a
victorious
tribe
or
feudal
lord
of
a
portion
of
the
earth
surface
but
as
solemnly
invested
with
an
office
not
only
did
he
excel
in
dignity
the
kings
of
the
earth
his
power
was
different
in
its
nature
and
so
far
from
supplanting
or
rivalling
theirs
rose
above
them
to
become
the
source
and
needful
condition
of
their
authority
in
their
several
territories
the
bond
which
joined
them
in
one
harmonious
body
the
vast
dominions
and
vigorous
personal
action
of
charles
the
great
had
concealed
this
distinction
while
he
reigned
under
his
successors
the
imperial
crown
appeared
disconnected
from
the
direct
government
of
the
kingdoms
they
had
established
existing
only
in
the
form
of
an
undefined
suzerainty
as
the
type
of
that
unity
without
which
minds
could
not
rest
it
was
characteristic
of
the
middle
ages
that
demanding
the
existence
of
an
emperor
they
were
careless
who
he
was
or
how
he
was
chosen
so
he
had
been
duly
inaugurated
and
that
they
were
not
shocked
by
the
contrast
between
unbounded
rights
and
actual
helplessness
at
no
time
in
the
world
history
has
theory
pretending
all
the
while
to
control
practice
been
so
utterly
divorced
from
it
ferocious
and
sensual
that
age
worshipped
humility
and
asceticism
there
has
never
been
a
purer
ideal
of
love
nor
a
grosser
profligacy
of
life
the
power
of
the
roman
emperor
can
not
as
yet
be
called
international
though
this
as
we
shall
see
became
in
later
times
its
most
important
aspect
for
in
the
tenth
century
national
distinctions
had
scarcely
begun
to
exist
but
its
genius
was
clerical
and
old
roman
in
nowise
territorial
or
teutonic
it
rested
not
on
armed
hosts
or
wide
lands
but
upon
the
duty
the
awe
the
love
of
its
subjects
footnotes
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
the
system
of
ideas
which
it
is
endeavoured
to
set
forth
in
the
following
pages
was
complete
in
this
particular
form
either
in
the
days
of
charles
or
in
those
of
otto
or
in
those
of
frederick
barbarossa
it
seems
to
have
been
constantly
growing
and
decaying
from
the
fourth
century
to
the
sixteenth
the
relative
prominence
of
its
cardinal
doctrines
varying
from
age
to
age
but
just
as
the
painter
who
sees
the
lights
and
shades
play
over
the
face
of
a
wide
landscape
faster
than
his
brush
can
place
them
on
the
canvas
in
despair
at
representing
their
exact
position
at
any
single
moment
contents
himself
with
painting
the
effects
that
are
broadest
and
most
permanent
and
at
giving
rather
the
impression
which
the
scene
makes
on
him
than
every
detail
of
the
scene
itself
so
here
the
best
and
indeed
the
only
practicable
course
seems
to
be
that
of
setting
forth
in
its
most
form
the
body
of
ideas
and
beliefs
on
which
the
empire
rested
although
this
form
may
not
be
exactly
that
which
they
can
be
asserted
to
have
worn
in
any
one
century
and
although
the
illustrations
adduced
may
have
to
be
taken
sometimes
from
earlier
sometimes
from
later
writers
as
the
doctrine
of
the
empire
was
in
its
essence
the
same
during
the
whole
middle
age

a
general
description

as
a
reviewer
in
the
whose
courtesy
it
is
the
more
pleasant
to
acknowledge
since
his
point
of
view
is
altogether
opposed
to
mine
has
understood
this
passage
as
meaning
that
imagined
the
christian
religion
was
to
last
for
ever
because
the
holy
roman
empire
was
never
to
decay
it
may
be
worth
while
to
say
that
this
is
far
from
being
the
purport
of
the
argument
which
this
chapter
was
designed
to
state
the
converse
would
be
nearer
the
truth
imagined
the
holy
roman
empire
was
never
to
decay
because
the
christian
religion
was
to
last
for
ever
the
phenomen
may
perhaps
be
stated
thus
men
who
were
already
disposed
to
believe
the
roman
empire
to
be
eternal
for
one
set
of
reasons
came
to
believe
the
christian
church
to
be
eternal
for
another
and
to
them
more
impressive
set
of
reasons
seeing
the
two
institutions
allied
in
fact
they
took
their
alliance
and
connection
to
be
eternal
also
and
went
on
for
centuries
believing
in
the
necessary
existence
of
the
roman
empire
because
they
believed
in
its
necessary
union
with
the
catholic
church
augustine
in
the
civitate
his
influence
great
through
all
the
middle

this
was
the
office
which
otto
the

assumed
in

it
was
not
his
only
office
he
was
already
a
german
king

the
new
dignity
by
no

superseded
the
old

union
in
one
person
of
two

a

little
need
be
said
since
it
differs
in
no
essential
respect
from
the
other
kingdoms
of
western
europe
as
they
stood
in
the
tenth
century
the
five
or
six
great
tribes

which
composed
the
german
nation

been
first
brought
together
under
the
sceptre
of
the
carolingians
and
though
still
retaining
marks
of
their
independent
origin
were
prevented
from
separating
by
community
of
speech
and
a
common
pride
in
the
great
frankish
empire
when
the
line
of
charles
the

ended
in
by
the
death
of
lewis

different

feudalism
there
had
been
under

a
singular
mixture
of
the

organization
by

as
we
find
in

from

to
place
the
control
of
the
central
government
in
the
suspension
of
that
government
which
followed
his
days
there
grew
up
a
system
whose
seeds
had
been
sown
as
far
back
as
the
time
of
clovis
a
system
whose
essence
was
the
combination
of
the
tenure
of
land
by
military
service
with
a
peculiar
personal
relation
between
the
landlord
and
his
tenant
whereby
the
one
was
bound
to
render
fatherly
protection
the
other
aid
and
obedience
this
is
not
the
place
for
tracing
the
origin
of
feudality
on
roman
soil
nor
for
shewing
how
by
a
sort
of
contagion
it
spread
into
germany
how
it
struck
firm
root
in
the
period
of
comparative
quiet
under
pipin
and
charles
how
from
the
hands
of
the
latter
it
took
the
impress
which
determined
its
ultimate
form
how
the
weakness
of
his
successors
allowed
it
to
triumph
everywhere
still
less
would
it
be
possible
here
to
examine
its
social
and
moral
influence
politically
it
might
be
defined
as
the
system
which
made
the
owner
of
a
piece
of
land
whether
large
or
small
the
sovereign
of
those
who
dwelt
thereon
an
annexation
of
personal
to
territorial
authority
more
familiar
to
eastern
despotism
than
to
the
free
races
of
primitive
europe
on
this
principle
were
founded
and
by
it
are
explained

his

the
position
which
his

it
is
just
because
the
relation
was
so
uniform
the
principle
so
comprehensive
the
ruling
class
so
firmly
bound
to
its
support
that
feudalism
has
been
able
to
lay

had
been
substituted

and
a
concentration
of

in

of

so
had
the
monarch
lost
his
ancient
character
as

all

he
exercised

less

as
standing
in

the

imitated
from
that
which
had
arisen
upon
roman

west
of
the

south
of

the

was
no

the

been

in
distant

a

of

and
their

bound
to

short

it
unwillingly
where
their

under

charles
were
now

were

not

obsolete

the

in
which
the

sometimes
to

oftener
to
concur
in

this
condition
of
things
was
indeed
better
than
that
utter
confusion
which
had
gone
before
for
a
principle
of
order
had
begun
to
group
and
bind
the
tossing
atoms
and
though
the
union
into
which
it
drove
men
was
a
hard
and
narrow
one
it
was
something
that
they
should
have
learnt
to
unite
themselves
at
all
yet
nascent
feudality
was
but
one
remove
from
anarchy
and
the
tendency
to
isolation
and
diversity
continued
despite
the
efforts
of
the
church
and
the
carolingian
princes
to
be
in
western
europe
the
german
kingdom
was
already
a
bond
between
the
german
races
and
appears
strong
and
united
when
we
compare
it
with
the
france
of
hugh
capet
or
the
england
of
ethelred
ii
yet
its
history
to
the
twelfth
century
is
little
else
than
a
record
of
disorders
revolts
civil
wars
of
a
ceaseless
struggle
on
the
part
of
the
monarch
to
enforce
his
feudal
rights
a
resistance
by
his
vassals
equally
obstinate
and
more
frequently
successful
what
the
issue
of
the
contest
might
have
been
if
germany
had
been
left
to
take
her
own
course
is
matter
of
speculation
though
the
example
of
every
european
state
except
england
and
norway
may
incline
the
balance
in
favour
of
the
crown
but
the
strife
had
scarcely
begun
when
a
new
influence
was
interposed
the
german
king
became
roman
emperor
no
two
systems
can
be
more
unlike
than
those
whose
headship
became
thus
vested
in
one
person
the
one
centralized
the
other
local
the
one
resting
on
a
sublime
theory
the
other
the
rude
offspring
of
anarchy
the
one
gathering
all
power
into
the
hands
of
an
irresponsible
monarch
the
other
limiting
his
rights
and
authorizing
resistance
to
his
commands
the
one
demanding
the
equality
of
all
citizens
as
creatures
equal
before

the
other
bound
up
with
an
aristocracy
the
proudest
and
in
its
gradations
of

the
most
exact
that
europe
had
ever
seen
characters
so
repugnant
could
not
it
might
be
thought
meet
in
one
person
or
if
they
met
must
strive
till
one
swallowed
up
the
other
it
was
not
so
in
the
fusion
which
began
from
the
first
though
it
was
for
a
time
imperceptible
each
of
the
two
characters
gave
and
each
lost
some
of
its
attributes
the
king
became
more
than
german
the
emperor
less
than
roman
till
at
the
end
of
six
centuries
the
monarch
in
whom
two
had
been
united
appeared
as
a
third
different
from
either
of
the
former
and
might
not
inappropriately
be
entitled
emperor
the
nature
and
progress
of
this
change
will
appear
in
the
after
history
of
germany
and
can
not
be
described
here
without
in
some
measure
anticipating
subsequent
events
a
word
or
two
may
indicate
how
the
process
of
fusion
began
sidenote
results
of
this
union
in
one
person
it
was
natural
that
the
great
mass
of
otto
subjects
to
whom
the
imperial
title
dimly
associated
with
rome
and
the
pope
sounded
grander
than
the
regal
without
being
known
as
otherwise
different
should
in
thought
and
speech
confound
them
the
sovereign
and
his
ecclesiastical
advisers
with
far
clearer
views
of
the
new
office
and
of
the
mutual
relation
of
the
two
found
it
impossible
to
separate
them
in
practice
and
were
glad
to
merge
the
lesser
in
the
greater
for
as
lord
of
the
world
otto
was
emperor
north
as
well
as
south
of
the
alps
when
he
issued
an
edict
he
claimed
the
obedience
of
his
teutonic
subjects
in
both
capacities
when
as
emperor
he
led
the
armies
of
the
gospel
against
the
heathen
it
was
the
standard
of
their
feudal
superior
that
his
armed
vassals
followed
when
he
founded
churches
and
appointed
bishops
he
acted
partly
as
suzerain
of
feudal
lands
partly
as
protector
of
the
faith
charged
to
guide
the
church
in
matters
temporal
thus
the
assumption
of
the
imperial
crown
brought
to
otto
as
its
first
result
an
apparent
increase
of
domestic
authority
it
made
his
position
by
its
historical
associations
more
dignified
by
its
religious
more
hallowed
it
raised
him
higher
above
his
vassals
and
above
other
sovereigns
it
enlarged
his
prerogative
in
ecclesiastical
affairs
and
by
necessary
consequence
gave
to
ecclesiastics
a
more
important
place
at
court
and
in
the
administration
of
government
than
they
had
enjoyed
before
great
as
was
the
power
of
the
bishops
and
abbots
in
all
the
feudal
kingdoms
it
stood
nowhere
so
high
as
in
germany
there
the
emperor
double
position
as
head
both
of
church
and
state
required
the
two
organizations
to
be
exactly
parallel
in
the
eleventh
century
a
full
half
of
the
land
and
wealth
of
the
country
and
no
small
part
of
its
military
strength
was
in
the
hands
of
churchmen
their
influence
predominated
in
the
diet
the
archchancellorship
of
the
empire
highest
of
all
offices
belonged
of
right
to
the
archbishop
of
mentz
as
primate
of
germany
it
was
by
otto
who
in
resuming
the
attitude
must
repeat
the
policy
of
charles
that
the
greatness
of
the
clergy
was
thus
advanced
he
is
commonly
said
to
have
wished
to
weaken
the
aristocracy
by
raising
up
rivals
to
them
in
the
hierarchy
it
may
have
been
so
and
the
measure
was
at
any
rate
a
disastrous
one
for
the
clergy
soon
approved
themselves
not
less
rebellious
than
those
whom
they
were
to
restrain
but
in
accusing
otto
judgment
historians
have
often
forgotten
in
what
position
he
stood
to
the
church
and
how
it
behoved
him
according
to
the
doctrine
received
to
establish
in
her
an
order
like
in
all
things
to
that
which
he
found
already
subsisting
in
the
state
sidenote

the
style
which
otto
adopted

tracing
as
we
are
the
history
of

it
is
needless
to
dwell
on
the
significance
of
the
change
charles

of
the
ripuarian

of
probus
had
been
a
frankish
chieftain
on
the
rhine

cheruscan
arminius

rule
his
native

with
a
power
borrowed
from
the
tiber
sidenote
imperial
power
feudalized
nevertheless
the
imperial
element
did
not
in
every
respect
predominate
over
the
royal
the
monarch
might
desire
to
make
good
against
his
turbulent
barons
the
boundless
prerogative
which
he
acquired
with
his
new
crown
but
he
lacked
the
power
to
do
so
and
they
disputing
neither
the
supremacy
of
that
crown
nor
his
right
to
wear
it
refused
with
good
reason
to
let
their
own
freedom
be
infringed
upon
by
any
act
of
which
they
had
not
been
the
authors
so
far
was
otto
from
embarking
on
so
vain
an
enterprise
that
his
rule
was
even
more
direct
and
more
personal
than
that
of
charles
had
been
there
was
no
scheme
of
mechanical
government
no
claim
of
absolutism
there
was
only
the
resolve
to
make
the
energetic
assertion
of
the

feudal

subserve
the
further
aims
of
the
emperor
what
otto
demanded
he
demanded
as
emperor
what
he
received
he
received
as
king
the
singular
result
was
that
in
germany
the
imperial

was
itself
pervaded
and
transformed
by
feudal
ideas

its
origin
the
divided

its
analogies
in
the
roman
tenure
of
emphyteusis
thus
while
germany
was
romanized
the
empire
was
feudalized
and
came
to
be
considered
not
the
antagonist
but
the
perfection
of
an
aristocratic
system
and
it
was
this
adaptation
to
existing
political
facts
that
enabled
it
afterwards
to
assume
an
international
character
nevertheless
even
while
they
seemed
to
blend
there
remained
between
the
genius
of
imperialism
if
one
may
use
a
now
perverted
word
and
that
of
feudalism
a
deep
and
lasting
hostility
and
so
the
rule
of
otto
and
his
successors
was
in
a
measure
adverse
to
feudal
polity
not
from
knowledge
of
what
roman
government
had
been
but
from
the
necessities
of
their
position
raised
as
they
were
to
an
unapproachable
height
above
their
subjects
surrounded
with
a
halo
of
sanctity
as
protectors
of
the
church
thus
were
they
driven
to
reduce
local
independence
and
assimilate
the
various
races
through
their
vast
territories
it
was
otto
who
made
the
germans
hitherto
an
aggregate
of
tribes
a
single
people
and
welding
them
into
a
strong
political
body
taught
them
to
rise
through
its
collective
greatness
to
the
consciousness
of
national
life
never
thenceforth

be
extinguished

expedient
against

which
roman
traditions
as
well
as

might
have
suggested
it
was
scarcely
possible
for

to
use
he
could
not
invoke
the

of
the

to

he
who
begins
to
read
the
history
of
the
middle
ages
is
alternately
amused
and
provoked
by
the
seeming
absurdities
that
meet
him
at
every
step
he
finds
writers
proclaiming
amidst
universal
assent
magnificent
theories
which
no
one
attempts
to
carry
out
he
sees
men
who
are
stained
with
every
vice
full
of
sincere
devotion
to
a
religion
which
even
when
its
doctrines
were
most
obscured
never
sullied
the
purity
of
its
moral
teaching
he
is
disposed
to
conclude
that
such
people
must
have
been
either
fools
or
hypocrites
yet
such
a
conclusion
would
be
wholly
erroneous
every
one
knows
how
little
a
man
actions
conform
to
the
general
maxims
which
he
would
lay
down
for
himself
and
how
many
things
there
are
which
he
believes
without
realizing
believes
sufficiently
to
be
influenced
yet
not
sufficiently
to
be
governed
by
them
now
in
the
middle
ages
this
perpetual
opposition
of
theory
and
practice
was
peculiarly
abrupt
men
impulses
were
more
violent
and
their
conduct
more
reckless
than
is
often
witnessed
in
modern
society
while
the
absence
of
a
criticizing
and
measuring
spirit
made
them
surrender
their
minds
more
unreservedly
than
they
would
now
do
to
a
complete
and
imposing
theory
therefore
it
was
that
while
everyone
believed
in
the
rights
of
the
empire
as
a
part
of
divine
truth
no
one
would
yield
to
them
where
his
own
passions
or
interests
interfered
resistance
to
god
vicar
might
be
and
indeed
was
admitted
to
be
a
deadly
sin
but
it
was
one
which
nobody
hesitated
to
commit
hence
in
order
to
give
this
unbounded
imperial
prerogative
any
practical
efficiency
it
was
found
necessary
to
prop
it
up
by
the
limited
but
tangible
authority
of
a
feudal
king
and
the
one
spot
in
otto
empire
on
which
feudality
had
never
fixed
its
grasp
and
where
therefore
he
was
forced
to
rule
merely
as
emperor
and
not
also
as
king
was
that
in
which
he
and
his
successors
were
never
safe
from
insult
and
revolt
that
spot
was
his
capital
accordingly
an
account
of
what
befel
the
first
saxon
emperor
in
rome
is
a
not
unfitting
comment
on
the
theory
expounded
above
as
well
as
a
curious
episode
in
the
history
of
the
apostolic
chair
sidenote
otto
the
great
in
rome
after
his
coronation
otto
had
returned
to
north
italy
where
the
partizans
of
berengar
and
his
son
adalbert
still
maintained
themselves
in
arms
scarcely
was
he
gone
when
the
restless
john
the
twelfth
who
found
too
late
that
in
seeking
an
ally
he
had
given
himself
a
master
renounced
his
allegiance
opened
negotiations
with
berengar
and
even
scrupled
not
to
send
envoys
pressing
the
heathen
magyars
to
invade
germany
the
emperor
was
soon
informed
of
these
plots
as
well
as
of
the
flagitious
life
of
the
pontiff
a
youth
of
the
most
profligate
if
not
the
most
guilty
of
all
who
have
worn
the
tiara
but
he
affected
to
despise
them
saying
with
a
sort
of
unconscious
irony
is
a
boy
the
example
of
good
men
may
reform
him
when
however
otto
returned
with
a
strong
force
he
found
the
city

shut
and
a
party
within
furious
against
him
john
the
twelfth
was
not
only
pope
but
as
the
heir
of
alberic
the
head
of
a
strong
faction
among
the
nobles
and
a
sort
of
temporal
prince
in
the
city
but
neither
he
nor
they
had
courage
enough
to
stand
a
siege
john
fled
into
the
campagna
to
join
adalbert
and
otto
entering
convoked
a
synod
in
peter
himself
presiding
as
temporal
head
of
the
church
he
began
by
inquiring
into
the
character
and
manners
of
the
pope
at
once
a
tempest
of
accusations
burst
forth
from
the
assembled
clergy
liudprand
a
credible
although
a
hostile
witness
gives
us
a
long
list
of
them
rose
and
witnessed
that
he
had
seen
the
pope
celebrate
mass
and
not
himself
communicate
john
bishop
of
narnia
and
john
declared
that
they
had
seen
him
ordain
a
deacon
in
a
stable
neglecting
the
proper
formalities
they
said
further
that
he
had
defiled
by
shameless
acts
of
vice
the
pontifical
palace
that
he
had
openly
diverted
himself
with
hunting
had
put
out
the
eyes
of
his
spiritual
father
benedict
had
set
fire
to
houses
had
girt
himself
with
a
sword
and
put
on
a
helmet
and
hauberk
all
present
laymen
as
well
as
priests
cried
out
that
he
had
drunk
to
the
devil
health
that
in
throwing
the
dice
he
had
invoked
the
help
of
jupiter
venus
and
other
demons
that
he
had
celebrated
matins
at
uncanonical
hours
and
had
not
fortified
himself
by
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
after
these
things
the
emperor
who
could
not
speak
latin
since
the
romans
could
not
understand
his
native
that
is
to
say
the
saxon
tongue
bade
liudprand
bishop
of
cremona
interpret
for
him
and
adjured
the
council
to
declare
whether
the
charges
they
had
brought
were
true
or
sprang
only
of
malice
and
envy
then
all
the
clergy
and
people
cried
with
a
loud
voice
john
the
pope
hath
not
committed
all
the
crimes
which
benedict
the
deacon
hath
read
over
and
even
greater
crimes
than
these
then
may
the
chief
of
the
apostles
the
blessed
peter
who
by
his
word
closes
heaven
to
the
unworthy
and
opens
it
to
the
just
never
absolve
us
from
our
sins
but
may
we
be
bound
by
the
chain
of
anathema
and
on
the
last
day
may
we
stand
on
the
left
hand
along
with
those
who
have
said
to
the
lord
god
depart
from
us
for
we
will
not
know
thy
ways
the
solemnity
of
this
answer
seems
to
have
satisfied
otto
and
the
council
a
letter
was
despatched
to
john
couched
in
respectful
terms
recounting
the
charges
brought
against
him
and
asking
him
to
appear
to
clear
himself
by
his
own
oath
and
that
of
a
sufficient
number
of
compurgators
john
reply
was
short
and
pithy
the
bishop
the
servant
of
the
servants
of
god
to
all
the
bishops
we
have
heard
tell
that
you
wish
to
set
up
another
pope
if
you
do
this
by
almighty
god
i
excommunicate
you
so
that
you
may
not
have
power
to
perform
mass
or
to
ordain
no
one
sidenote
deposition
of
john
xii
to
this
otto
and
the
synod
replied
by
a
letter
of
humorous
expostulation
begging
the
pope
to
reform
both
his
morals
and
his
latin
but
the
messenger
who
bore
it
could
not
find
john
he
had
repeated
what
seems
to
have
been
thought
his
most
heinous
sin
by
going
into
the
country
with
his
bow
and
arrows
and
after
a
search
had
been
made
in
vain
the
synod
resolved
to
take
a
decisive
step
otto
who
still
led
their
deliberations
demanded
the
condemnation
of
the
pope
the
assembly
deposed
him
by
acclamation
of
his
reprobate
life
and
having
obtained
the
emperor
consent
proceeded
in
an
equally
hasty
manner
to
raise
leo
the
chief
secretary
and
a
layman
to
the
chair
of
the
apostle
sidenote
revolt
of
the
romans
otto
might
seem
to
have
now
reached
a
position
loftier
and
firmer
than
that
of
any
of
his
predecessors
within
little
more
than
a
year
from
his
arrival
in
rome
he
had
exercised
powers
greater
than
those
of
charles
himself
ordering
the
dethronement
of
one
pontiff
and
the
installation
of
another
forcing
a
reluctant
people
to
bend
themselves
to
his
will
the
submission
involved
in
his
oath
to
protect
the
holy
see
was
more
than
compensated
by
the
oath
of
allegiance
to
his
crown
which
the
pope
and
the
romans
had
taken
and
by
their
solemn
engagement
not
to
elect
nor
ordain
any
future
pontiff
without
the
emperor
consent
but
he
had
yet
to
learn
what
this
obedience
and
these
oaths
were
worth
the
romans
had
eagerly
joined
in
the
expulsion
of
john
they
soon
began
to
regret
him
they
were
mortified
to
see
their
streets
filled
by
a
foreign
soldiery
the
habitual
licence
of
their
manners
sternly
repressed
their
most
cherished
privilege
the
right
of
choosing
the
universal
bishop
grasped
by
the
strong
hand
of
a
master
who
used
it
for
purposes
in
which
they
did
not
sympathize
in
a
fickle
and
turbulent
people
disaffection
quickly
turned
to
rebellion
one
night
otto

being
most
of
them
dispersed
in
their
quarters
at
a
distance
the
romans
rose
in
arms
blocked
up
the
tiber
bridges
and
fell
furiously
upon
the
emperor
and
his
creature
the
new
pope
superior
valour
and
constancy
triumphed
over
numbers
and
the
romans
were
overthrown
with
terrible
slaughter
yet
this
lesson
did
not
prevent
them
from
revolting
a
second
time
after
otto
departure
in
pursuit
of
adalbert
john
the
twelfth
returned
to
the
city
and
when
his
pontifical
career
was
speedily
closed
by
the
sword
of
an
injured
husband
the
people
chose
a
new
pope
in
defiance
of
the
emperor
and
his
nominee
otto
again
subdued
and
again
forgave
them
but
when
they
rebelled
for
a
third
time

he
resolved
to
shew
them
what
imperial

too
must
not
presume
on
the
sacredness
of
his
person
to
set
up
any
claims

the
pontiff
as
no
more
than

his
subjects

of

own
will

depositary
of

authority
which
must

to
the

an
absolute
veto
on

obtained
from
his
nominee

a
confirmation
of
this
privilege
which
it
was
afterwards
supposed
that
hadrian
i
had
granted
to
charles
in
a
decree
which
may
yet
be
read
in
the
collections

the
canon

the
vigorous
exercise
of
such
a

might
be
expected

as
to
restrain
the
apostolic
see
and
it
was
for
this
purpose
and
in
noble
honesty
that
the
teutonic
sovereigns
employed
it
but
the
fortunes
of
otto
in
the
city
are
a
type
of
those
which
his
successors
were
destined
to
experience
notwithstanding
their
clear
rights

with
which

were

the

was

two
main
objects
the

considerable
freedom

the

not
unwilling

dared
to
defend

but
when
gregory
vii
declared
that
it
was
sin
for
the
ecclesiastic
to
receive
his
benefice
under
conditions
from
a
layman
and
so
condemned
the
whole

deadly
blow

half
of

absolute
superiority

he
was

gregory
was
not
the
inventor
nor
the
first
propounder
of
these
doctrines
they
had
been
long
before
a
part
of
mediæval
christianity
interwoven
with
its
most
vital
doctrines
but
he
was
the
first
who
dared
to
apply
them
to
the
world
as
he
found
it
his
was
that
rarest
and
grandest
of
gifts
an
intellectual
courage
and
power
of
imaginative
belief
which
when
it
has
convinced
itself
of
aught
accepts
it
fully
with
all
its
consequences
and
shrinks
not
from
acting
at
once
upon
it
a
perilous
gift
as
the
melancholy
end
of
his
own
career
proved
for
men
were
found
less
ready
than
he
had
thought
them
to
follow
out
with
unswerving
consistency
like
his
the
principles
which
all
acknowledged
but
it
was
the
very
suddenness
and
boldness
of
his
policy
that
secured
the
ultimate
triumph
of
his
cause
awing
minds
and
making
that
seem
realized
which
had
been
till
then
a
vague
theory
his
premises
once
admitted
and
no
one
dreamt
of
denying
them
the
reasonings
by
which
he
established
the
superiority
of
spiritual
to
temporal
jurisdiction
were
unassailable
with
his
authority
in
whose
hands
are
the
keys
of
heaven
and
hell
whose
word
can
bestow
eternal
bliss
or
plunge
in
everlasting
misery
no
other
earthly
authority
can
compete
or
interfere
if
his
power
extends
into
the
infinite
how
much
more
must
he
be
supreme
over
things
finite
it
was
thus
that
gregory
and
his
successors
were
wont
to
argue
the
wonder
is
not
that
they
were
obeyed
but
that
they
were
not
obeyed
more
implicitly
in
the
second
sentence
of
excommunication
which
gregory
passed
upon
henry
the
fourth

these
words
now
i
beseech
you
o
most
holy

blessed
fathers

all
the

may

that

ye
are
able
to
bind

to

ye
are
likewise
able

such
as
these
do
indeed
strike
equally
at

were
the
innocents

of

them

however
the
blow
fell
first

as
when

must
suffice
to
describe
the

of

whole
drama
which
was
to
extend
over
centuries
but
of
what
may
be

its

raised
in
rebellion
against
him
but
that
son
the
emperor
henry
the
fifth
so
far
from
conceding
the
points
in
dispute
proved
an
antagonist
more
ruthless
and
not
less
able
than
his
father
he
claimed
for
his
crown
all
the
rights
over
ecclesiastics
that
his
predecessors
had
ever
enjoyed
and
when
at
his
coronation
in
rome
pope
paschal
ii
refused
to
complete
the
rite
until
he
should
have
yielded
henry
seized
both
pope
and

and
compelled
them
by
a
rigorous
imprisonment
to
consent
to
a
treaty
which
he
dictated
once
set
free
the
pope
as
was
natural
disavowed
his
extorted
concessions
and
the
struggle
was
protracted
for
ten
years
longer
until
nearly
half
a
century
had
elapsed
from
the
first
quarrel
between
gregory

and
henry

the
concordat
of

concluded
in
was
in
form
a
compromise
designed
to
spare
either
party
the
humiliation
of
defeat
yet
the
papacy
remained
master
of
the
field
the
emperor
retained
but
of
those
rights
of
investiture
which
had
formerly
been
his
he
could
never

position
of
henry

his
wishes
or

might
influence
the
proceedings
of
a

his

bound
him
from

interference
he
had
entered
the
strife
in
the
fulness
of
dignity
he
came
out
of
it
with
tarnished
glory
and
shattered
power
his
wars
had
been
hitherto
carried
on
with
foreign
foes
or
at
worst
with
a
single
rebel
noble
now
his
steadiest
ally
was
turned
into
his

assailant
and
had
enlisted
against
him
half
his

of

at

might
be

two
other
results
of
this
great
conflict
ought
not
to
pass
unnoticed
the
emperor
was
alienated
from
the
church
at
the
most
unfortunate
of
all
moments
the
era
of
the
crusades

the
faith

the
church
militant
in
her
carnal
as
the
popes
were
accustomed
to
do
in
her
spiritual
strife
this
was
the
very
purpose
for
which
an
emperor
had
been
called
into
being
and
it
was
indeed
in
these
wars
more
particularly
in
the
first
three
of
them
that
the
ideal
of
a
christian
commonwealth
which
the
theory
of
the
mediæval
empire
proclaimed
was
once
for
all
and
never
again
realized
by
the
combined
action
of
the
great
nations
of
europe
had
such
an
opportunity
fallen
to
the
lot
of
henry
iii
he
might
have
used
it
to
win
back
a
supremacy
hardly
inferior
to
that
which
had
belonged
to
the
first
carolingians
but
henry
iv
proscription
excluded
him
from
all
share
in
an
enterprise
which
he
must
otherwise
have
led
nay
more
committed
it
to
the
guidance
of
his
foes
the
religious
feeling
which
the
crusades
evoked
a
feeling
which
became
the
origin
of
the
great
orders
of
chivalry
and
somewhat
later
of
the
two
great
orders
of
mendicant
friars
turned
wholly
against
the
opponent
of
ecclesiastical
claims
and
was
made
to
work
the
will
of
the
holy
see
which
had
blessed
and
organized
the
project
a
century
and
a
half
later
the
pope
did
not
scruple
to
preach
a
crusade
against
the
emperor
himself
again
it
was
now
that
the
first
seeds
were
sown
of
that
fear
and
hatred
wherewith
the
german
people
never
thenceforth
ceased
to
regard
the
encroaching
romish
court
branded
by
the
church
and
forsaken
by
the

henry

retained
the
affections
of

the

of

is
not
its

triumph
of

sidenote
frederick
of
hohenstaufen
the
reign
of
frederick
the
first
better
known
under
his
italian
surname
barbarossa
is
the
most
brilliant
in
the
annals
of
the
empire
its
territory
had
been
wider
under
charles
its
strength
perhaps
greater
under
henry
the
third
but
it
never
appeared
in
such
pervading
vivid
activity
never
shone
with
such
lustre
of
chivalry
as
under
the
prince
whom
his
countrymen
have
taken
to
be
one
of
their
national
heroes
and
who
is
still
as
the
type
of
teutonic
character
honoured
by
picture
and
statue
in
song
and
in
legend
through
the
breadth
of
the
german
lands
the
reverential
fondness
of
his
annalists
and
the
whole
tenour
of
his
life
go
far
to
justify
this
admiration
and
dispose
us
to
believe
that
nobler
motives
were
joined
with
personal
ambition
in
urging
him
to
assert
so
haughtily
and
carry
out
so
harshly
those
imperial
rights
in
which
he
had
such
unbounded
confidence
under
his
guidance
the
transalpine
power
made
its
greatest
effort
to
subdue
the
two
antagonists
which
then
threatened
and
were
fated
in
the
end
to
destroy
it
italian
nationality
and
the
papacy
sidenote
his
relations
to
the
popedom
even
before
gregory
vii
time
it
might
have
been
predicted
that
two
such
potentates
as
the
emperor
and
the
pope
closely
bound
together
yet
each
with
pretensions
wide
and
undefined
must
ere
long
come
into
collision
the
boldness
of
that
great
pontiff
in
enforcing
the
unflinching
firmness
of
his
successors
in
maintaining
the
supremacy
of
clerical
authority
inspired
their
supporters
with
a
zeal
and
courage
which
more
than
compensated
the
advantages
of
the
emperor
in
defending
rights
he
had
long
enjoyed
on
both
sides
the
hatred
was
soon
very
bitter
but
even
had
men
passions
permitted
a
reconciliation
it
would
have
been
found
difficult
to
bring
into
harmony
adverse
principles
each
irresistible
mutually
destructive
as
the
spiritual
power
in
itself
purer
since
exercised
over
the
soul
and
directed
to
the
highest
of
all
ends
eternal
felicity
was
entitled
to
the
obedience
of
all
laymen
as
well
as
clergy
so
the
spiritual
person
to
whom
according
to
the
view
then
universally
accepted
there
had
been
imparted
by
ordination
a
mysterious
sanctity
could
not
without
sin
be
subject
to
the
lay
magistrate
be
installed
by
him
in
office
be
judged
in
his
court
and
render
to
him
any
compulsory
service
yet
it
was
no
less
true
that
civil
government
was
indispensable
to
the
peace
and
advancement
of
society
and
while
it
continued
to
subsist
another
jurisdiction
could
not
be
suffered
to
interfere
with
its
workings
nor
of
the
people
be
altogether
removed
from
its
control
thus
the
emperor
and
the
pope
were
forced
into
hostility
as
champions
of
opposite
systems
however
fully
each
might
admit
the
strength
of
his
adversary

however
bitterly
he
might
bewail
the
violence

which
constantine

adopted
the
candidate
whom
his

had
chosen

the

claimant
alexander

appealed
with
a
confidence

justified

throughout

the
keen
and
long
doubtful
strife
of
twenty
years
that
followed
while
apparently
a
dispute
between

was
in

an
effort
by
the
secular
monarch
to
recover
his

by

words

exaggeration

enhance
the

full
of

for
the
future
than
it
was
solemn
and
affecting
to
the
venetian
crowd
that
thronged
the
church
and
the
piazza
for
it
was
the
renunciation
by
the
mightiest
prince
of
his
time
of
the
project
to
which
his
life
had
been
devoted
it
was
the
abandonment
by
the
secular

vanquished

this

version
of
the
of

sidenote
the
lombard
cities
he
who
had
been
so
stern
to
his
own
capital
was
not
likely
to
deal
more
gently
with
the
rebels
of
milan
and
tortona
in
the
contest
by
which
frederick
is
chiefly
known
to
history
he
is
commonly
painted
as
the
foreign
tyrant
the
forerunner
of
the
austrian
oppressor
crushing
under
the
hoofs
of
his
cavalry
the
home
of
freedom
and
industry
such
a
view
is
unjust
to
a
great
man
and
his
cause
to
the
despot
liberty
is
always
licence
yet
frederick
was
the
advocate
of
admitted
claims
the
aggressions
of
milan
threatened
her
neighbours
the
refusal
where
no
actual
oppression
was
alleged
to
admit
his
officers
and
allow
his
regalian
rights
seemed
a
wanton
breach
of
oaths
and
engagements
treason
against
god
no
less
than
himself
nevertheless
our
sympathy
must
go
with
the
cities
in
whose
victory
we
recognize
the
triumph
of
freedom
and
civilization
their
resistance
was
at
first
probably
a
mere
aversion
to
unused
control
and
to
the
enforcement
of
imposts
less
offensive
in
former
days
than
now
and
by
long

centuries

it
was
under

to

of

partly
to
the
ascendancy
of

the

influence

fully
coincided

kingdoms
must
depend
on
the
empire
a
notion
which
appears
in
conrad
letter
to
john
of
constantinople
and
which
was
countenanced
by
the
submissive
tone
in
which
frederick

was
addressed
by

have

in

he

the
case
finds
a

in
the

to
say
the

as

not

as

a

world
saw
itself
distracted
by
the
interminable
feud
of
rivals

of
whom
had
much
to
allege
on

it
was
easy
for
the
latins
to
call
the
easterns
schismatics
and
their
emperor
an
usurper
but
practically
it
was
impossible
to
dethrone
him
or
reduce
them
to
obedience
while
even
in
controversy
no
one
could
treat
the
pretensions
of
communities
who
had
been
the
first
to
embrace
christianity
and
retained
so
many
of
its
most
ancient
forms
with
the
contempt
which
would
have
been
felt
for
any
western
sectaries
seriously
however
as
the
hostile
position
of
the
greeks
seems
to
us
to
affect
the
claims
of
the
teutonic
empire
calling
in
question
its
legitimacy
and
marring
its
pretended
universality
those
who
lived
at
the
time
seem
to
have
troubled
themselves
little
about
it
finding
themselves
in
practice
seldom
confronted
by
the
difficulties
it
raised
the
great
mass
of
the
people
knew
of
the
greeks
not
even
by
name
of
those
who
did
the
most
thought
of
them
only
as
perverse
rebels
samaritans
who
refused
to
worship
at
jerusalem
and
were
little
better
than
infidels
the
few
ecclesiastics
of
superior
knowledge
and
insight
had
their
minds
preoccupied
by
the
established
theory
and
accepted
it
with
too
intense
a
belief
to
suffer
anything
else
to
come
into
collision
with
it
they
do
not
seem
to
have
even
apprehended
all
that
was
involved
in
this
one
defect
nor
what
is
still
stranger
in
all
the
attacks
made
upon
the
claims
of
the
teutonic
empire
whether
by
its
papal
or
its
french
antagonists
do
we
find
the
rival
title
of
the
greek
sovereigns
adduced
in
argument
against
it
nevertheless
the
eastern
church
was
then
as
she
is
to
this
day
a
thorn
in
the
side
of
the
papacy
and
the
eastern
emperors
so
far
from
uniting
for
the
good
of
christendom
with
their
western
brethren
felt
towards
them
a
bitter
though
not
unnatural
jealousy
lost
no
opportunity
of
intriguing
for
their
evil
and
never
ceased
to
deny
their
right
to
the
imperial
name
the
coronation
of
charles
was
in
their
eyes
an
act
of
unholy
rebellion
his
successors
were
barbarian
intruders
ignorant
of
the
laws
and
usages
of
the
ancient
state
and
with
no
claim
to
the
roman
name
except
that
which
the
favour
of
an
insolent
pontiff
might
confer
the
greeks
had
themselves
long
since
ceased
to
use
the
latin
tongue
and
were
indeed
become
more
than
half
orientals
in
character
and
manners
but
they
still
continued
to
call
themselves

preserved
most
of
the
titles
and
ceremonies
which
had
existed
in
the
time

constantine

justinian
they
were
weak
although
by
no
means
so
weak
as
modern
historians
have
been
till
lately
wont
to
paint
them
and
the
weaker
they
grew
the
higher
rose
their
conceit
and
the
more
did
they
plume
themselves
upon
the
uninterrupted
legitimacy
of
their
crown
and
the
ceremonial
splendour
wherewith
custom
had
surrounded
its
wearer
it
gratified
their
spite
to
pervert

these
ebullitions
were
the
most
conclusive
proof
of
their
weakness
the
byzantine
rulers
sometimes
planned
the
recovery
of
their
former
capital
and
seemed
not
unlikely
to
succeed
under
the
leadership
of
the
conquering

alexander

dignities

happily
not

did
not
therefore
endeavour
to
unite
their
several
kingdoms
but
continued
to
go
through
four
distinct
coronations
at
the
four
capitals
of
their
empire
these
are
concisely
given
in
the
verses
of
godfrey
of

a
notary
of

in

times
at

in

times
he
became

of

or
of
the
lombards
at

he
received
the
double
crown
of
the
roman
empire
says
godfrey
as
et

in

sedet
though
others
hold
that
uniting
the
mitre
to
the
crown
it
typifies
spiritual
as
well
as
secular
authority
the
crown
of
burgundy
or
the
kingdom
of
arles
first
gained
by
conrad
ii
was
a
much
less
splendid
matter
and
carried
with
it
little
effective
power
most
emperors
never
assumed
it
at
all
frederick
i
not
till
late
in
life
when
an
interval
of
leisure
left
him
nothing
better
to
do
these
four
crowns
furnish
matter
of
endless
discussion
to
the
old
writers
they
tell
us
that
the
roman
was
golden
the
german
silver
the
italian
iron
the
metal
corresponding
to
the
dignity
of
each
realm
others
say
that
that
of
aachen
is
iron
and
the
italian
silver
and
give
elaborate
reasons
why
it
should
be
so
there
seems
to
be
no
doubt
that
the
allegory
created
the
fact
and
that
all
three
crowns
were
of
gold
though
in
that
of
italy
there
was
and
is
inserted
a
piece
of
iron
a
nail
it
was
believed
of
the
true
cross
sidenote
meaning
of
the
four
coronations
why
it
may
well
be
asked
seeing
that
the
roman
crown
made
the
emperor
ruler
of
the
whole
habitable
globe
was
it
thought
necessary
for
him
to
add
to
it
minor
dignities
which
might
be
supposed
to
have
been
already
included
in
it
the
reason
seems
to
be
that
the
imperial
office
was
conceived
of
as
something
different
in
kind
from
the
regal
and
as
carrying
with
it
not
the
immediate
government
of
any
particular
kingdom
but
a
general
suzerainty
over
and
right
of
controlling
all
of
this
a
pertinent
illustration
is
afforded
by
an
anecdote
told
of
frederick
barbarossa
happening
once
to
inquire
of
the
famous
jurists
who
surrounded
him
whether
it
was
really
true
that
he
was
of
the
world
one
of
them
simply
assented
another
bulgarus
answered
as
respects
ownership
in
this
dictum
which
is
evidently
conformable
to
the
philosophical
theory
of
the
empire
we
have
a
pointed
distinction
drawn
between
feudal
sovereignty
which
supposes
the
prince
original
owner
of
the
soil
of
his
whole
kingdom
and
imperial
sovereignty
which
is
irrespective
of
place
and
exercised
not
over
things
but
over
men
as
god
rational
creatures
but
the
emperor
as
has
been
said
already
was
also
the
east
frankish
king
uniting
in
himself
to
use
the
legal
phrase
two
wholly
distinct
and
hence
he
might
acquire
more
direct
and
practically
useful
rights
over
a
portion
of
his
dominions
by
being
crowned
king
of
that
portion
just
as
a
feudal
monarch
was
often
duke
or
count
of
lordships
whereof
he
was
already
feudal
superior
or
to
take
a
better
illustration
just
as
a
bishop
may
hold
livings
in
his
own
diocese
that
the
emperors
while
continuing
to
be
crowned
at
milan
and
aachen
did
not
call
themselves
kings
of
the
lombards
and
of
the
franks
was
probably
merely
because
these
titles
seemed
insignificant
compared
to
that
of

of
this

in
this
supreme
title

has
been

were
blent

but
custom
or
prejudice
forbade
the
german

to
assume
it

by
the
pope
matters
of
phrase
and
title
are
never
unimportant
least
of
all
in
an
age
ignorant
and
superstitiously
antiquarian
and
this
restriction
had
the
most
important
consequences
the
first
barbarian
kings
had
been
and
when
they
claimed
a
dominion
which
was
universal
yet
in
a
sense
territorial
they
could
not
separate
their
title
from
the
spot
which
it
was
their
boast
to
possess
and
by
virtue
of
whose
name
they
ruled
says
the
biographer
of
adalbert
that
she
both
is
and
is
called
the
head
of
the
world
and
the
mistress
of
cities
is
alone
able
to
give
to
kings
imperial
power
and
since
she
cherishes
in
her
bosom
the
body
of
the
prince
of
the
apostles
she
ought
of
right
to
appoint
the
prince
of
the
whole
earth
the
crown
was
therefore
too
sacred
to
be
conferred
by
any
one
but
the
supreme
pontiff
or
in
any
city
less
august
than
the
ancient
capital

it

what

shewn
by
the
success
of
a
forgery
so
gross
as

and
the
spell
of
reverence
in
the
teutonic
princes
it
passed
into
an
unquestioned
belief
that
none
ventured
to
use
the
title
till
the
pope
conferred
it
made
it
seem
in
some
manner
to
depend
on
his
will
enabled
him
to
exact
conditions
from
every
candidate
and
gave
a
colour
to
his
pretended
suzerainty
since
by
feudal
theory
every
honour
and
estate
is
held
from
some
superior
and
since
the
divine
commission
has
been
without
doubt
issued
directly
to
the
pope
must
not
the
whole
earth
be
his
fief
and
he
the
lord
paramount
to
whom
even
the
emperor
is
a
vassal
this
argument
which
derived
considerable
plausibility
from
the
rivalry
between
the
emperor
and
other
monarchs
as
compared
with
the
universal
and
undisputed
authority
of
the
pope
was
a
favourite
with
the
high
sacerdotal
party
first
distinctly
advanced
by
hadrian
iv
when
he
set
up
the
picture
representing
lothar
homage
which
had
so
irritated
the
followers
of
barbarossa
though
it
had
already
been
hinted
at
in
gregory
vii
gift
of
the
crown
to
rudolf
of
suabia
with
the
line
dedit
petro
petrus
diadema
rudolfo
nor
was
it
only
by
putting
him
at
the
pontiff
mercy
that
this
dependence
of
the
imperial
name
on
a
coronation
in
the
city
injured
the
german
sovereign
with
strange
inconsistency
it
was
not
pretended
that
the
emperor
rights
were
any
narrower
before
he
received
the
rite
he
could
summon
synods
confirm
papal
elections
exercise
jurisdiction
over
the
citizens
his
claim
of
the
crown
itself
could
not
at
least
till
the
times
of
the
gregorys
and
the
innocents
be
positively
denied
for
no
one
thought
of
contesting
the
right
of
the
german
nation
to
the
empire
or
the
authority
of
the
electoral
princes
strangers
though
they
were
to
give
rome
and
italy
a
master
the
republican
followers
of
arnold
of
brescia
might
murmur
but
they
could
not
dispute
the
truth
of
the
proud
lines
in
which
the
poet
who
sang
the
glories
of
barbarossa
describes
the
result
of
the
conquest
of
charles
the
great

but
the
real
strength
of
the
teutonic
kingdom
was
wasted
in
the
pursuit
of
a
glittering
toy
once
in
his
reign
each
emperor
undertook
a
long
and
dangerous
expedition
and
dissipated
in
an
inglorious
and
ever
to
be
repeated
strife
the
forces
that
might
have
achieved
conquest

or
made
him
feared
and

sidenote
the
title
empire
at
this
epoch
appears
another
title
of
which
more
must
be
said
to
the
accustomed
empire
frederick
barbarossa
adds
the
epithet
of
of
its
earlier
origin
under
conrad
ii
the
salic
which
some
have
supposed
there
is
no
documentary
trace
though
there
is
also
no
proof
to
the
contrary
so
far
as
is
known
it
occurs
first
in
the
famous
privilege
of
austria
granted
by
frederick
in
the
fourth
year
of
his
reign
the
second
of
his
empire
austriæ
quæ
clypeus
et
cor
sacri
imperii
esse
dinoscitur
then
afterwards
in
other
manifestos
of
his
reign
for
example
in
a
letter
to
isaac
angelus
of
byzantium
and
in
the
summons
to
the
princes
to
help
him
against
milan
urbis
et
orbis
gubernacula
tenemus
sacro
imperio
et
divæ
reipublicæ
consulere
debemus
where
the
second
phrase
is
a
synonym
explanatory
of
the
first
used
occasionally
by
henry
vi
and
frederick
ii
it
is
more
frequent
under
their
successors
william
richard
rudolf
till
after
charles
iv
time
it
becomes
habitual
for
the
last
few
centuries
indispensable
regarding
the
origin
of
so
singular
a
title
many
theories
have
been
advanced
some
declared
it
a
perpetuation
of
the
court
style
of
rome
and
byzantium
which
attached
sanctity
to
the
person
of
the
monarch
thus
david
blondel
contending
for
the
honour
of
france
calls
it
a
mere
epithet
of
the
emperor
applied
by
confusion
to
his
government
others
saw
in
it
a
religious
meaning
referring
to
daniel
prophecy
or
to
the
fact
that
the
empire
was
contemporary
with
christianity
or
to
christ
birth
under
it
strong
churchmen
derived
it
from
the
dependence
of
the
imperial
crown
on
the
pope
there
were
not
wanting
persons
to
maintain
that
it
meant
nothing
more
than
great
or
splendid
we
need
not
however
be
in
any
great
doubt
as
to
its
true
meaning
and
purport
the
ascription
of
sacredness
to
the
person
the
palace
the
letters
and
so
forth
of
the
sovereign
so
common
in
the
later
ages
of
rome
had
been
partly
retained
in
the
german
court
liudprand
calls
otto
sanctissimus
still
this
sanctity
which
the
greeks
above
all
others
lavished
on
their
princes
is
something
personal
is
nothing
more
than
the
divinity
that
always
hedges
a
king
far
more
intimate
and
peculiar
was
the
relation
of
the
revived
roman
empire
to
the
church
and
religion
as
has
been
said
already
it
was
neither
more
nor
less
than
the
visible
church
seen
on
its
secular
side
the
christian
society
organized
as
a
state
under
a
form
divinely
appointed
and
therefore
the
name
roman
empire
was
the
needful
and
rightful
counterpart
to
that
of
catholic
church
such
had
long
been
the
belief
and
so
the
title
might
have
had
its
origin
as
far
back
as
the
tenth
or
ninth
century
might
even
have
emanated
from
charles
himself
alcuin
in
one
of
his
letters
uses
the
phrase
christianum
but
there
was
a
further
reason
for
its
introduction
at
this
particular
epoch
ever
since
hildebrand
had
claimed
for
the
priesthood
exclusive
sanctity
and
supreme
jurisdiction
the
papal
party
had
not
ceased
to
speak
of
the
civil
power
as
being
compared
with
that
of
their
own
chief
merely
secular
earthly
profane
it
may
be
conjectured
that
to
meet
this
reproach
no
less
injurious
than
insulting
frederick
or
his
advisers
began
to
use
in
public
documents
the
expression
empire
thereby
wishing
to
assert
the
divine
institution
and
religious
duties
of
the
office
he
held
previous
emperors
had
called
themselves
defensores
now
their
state
itself
is
consecrated
an
earthly
theocracy
romanum
imperium
adversus
schisma
ecclesiæ
præparavit
writes
frederick
to
the
english
henry
ii
the
theory
was
one
which
the
best
and
greatest
emperors
charles
otto
the
great
henry
iii
had
most
striven
to
carry
out
it
continued
to
be
zealously
upheld
when
it
had
long
ceased
to
be
practicable
in
the
proclamations
of
mediæval
kings
there
is
a
constant
dwelling
on
their
divine
commission
power
in
an
age
of
violence
sought
to
justify
while
it
enforced
its
commands
to
make
brute
force
less
brutal
by
appeals
to
a
higher
sanction
this
is
seen
nowhere
more
than
in
the
style
of
the
german
sovereigns
they
delight
in
the
phrases
sacrosancta
divina
ordinante
providentia
pietate
misericordiam
dei
many
of
which
were
preserved
till
like
those
used
now
by
other
european
kings
like
our
own
of
the
faith
they
had
become
at
last
more
grotesque
than
solemn
the

the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century

christian
church
of
christ
head
of
the
faithful
of
the
christian
army
of
palestine
of
general
councils
of
the
catholic
faith
the
title
if
it
added
little
to
the
power
yet
certainly
seems
to
have
increased
the
dignity
of
the
empire
and
by
consequence
the
jealousy
of
other
states
of
france
especially
this
did
not
however
go
so
far
as
to
prevent
its
recognition
by
the
pope
and
the
french
king
and
after
the
sixteenth
century
it
would
have
been
a
breach
of
diplomatic
courtesy
to
omit
it
nor
have
imitators
been
wanting

titles
as

it
is
hardly
necessary
to
observe
that
the
connection
of

with
the

of

recent
origin
and
of
a
purely
dynastic
nature
the
position
of
the
archdukes
of
austria
as
kings
of
hungary
had
nothing
to
do
legally
with
the
fact
that
many
of
them
were
also
chosen
emperors
although
practically
their
possession
of
the
imperial
crown
had
greatly
aided
them

is
almost
superfluous
to
observe
that
the

of
the

has
nothing
to
do
with
the
beginning
of
the
empire
itself
essentially
and
substantially
the
holy
roman
empire
was
as
has
been
shewn
already
the
creation
of
charles

looking
at
it
more
technically
as
the
monarchy
not
of
the
whole

like
that
of
charles
but
of
germany
and
italy
with
a
claim
which
was
never
more
than
a
claim
to
universal
sovereignty
its
beginning
is
fixed
by
most
of
the
german
writers
whose
practice
has
been
followed
in
the
text
at
the

in

three

the
holy
empire
has
been
described
in
what
is
not
only
the
most
brilliant
but
the
most
momentous
period
of
its
history
the
period
of
its
rivalry
with
the
popedom
for
the
chief
place
in
christendom
for
it
was
mainly
through
their
relations
with
the
spiritual
power
by
their
friendship
and
protection
at
first
no
less
than
by
their
subsequent
hostility
that
the
teutonic
emperors
influenced
the
development
of
european
politics
the
reform
of
the
roman
church
which
went
on
during
the
reigns
of
otto
i
and
his
successors
down
to
henry
iii
and
which
was
chiefly
due
to
the
efforts
of
those
monarchs
was
the
true
beginning
of
the
grand
period
of
the
middle
ages
the
first
of
that
long
series
of
movements
changes
and
creations
in
the
ecclesiastical
system
of
europe
which
was
so
to
speak
the
master
current
of
history
secular
as
well
as
religious
during
the
centuries
which
followed
the
first
result
of
henry
purification
of
the
papacy
was
seen
in
hildebrand
attempt
to
subject
all
jurisdiction
to
that
of
his
own
chair
and
in
the
long
struggle
of
the
investitures
which
brought
out
into
clear
light
the
opposing
pretensions
of
the
temporal
and
spiritual
powers
although
destined
in
the
end
to
bear
far
other
fruit
the
immediate
effect
of
this
struggle
was
to
evoke
in
all
classes
an
intense
religious
feeling
and
in
opening
up
new
fields
of
ambition
to
the
hierarchy
to
stimulate
wonderfully
their
power
of
political
organization
it
was
this
impulse
that
gave
birth
to
the
crusades
and
that
enabled
the
popes
stepping
forth
as
the
rightful
leaders
of
a
religious
war
to
bend
it
to
serve
their
own
ends
it
was
thus
too
that
they
struck
the
alliance
strange
as
such
an
alliance
seems
now
with
the
rebellious
cities
of
lombardy
and
proclaimed
themselves
the
protectors
of
municipal
freedom
but
the
third
and
crowning
triumph
of
the
holy
see
was
reserved
for
the
thirteenth
century
in
the
foundation
of
the
two
great
orders
of
ecclesiastical
knighthood
the
dominicans
and
franciscans
the
religious
fervour
of
the
middle
ages
culminated
in
the
overthrow
of
the
only
power
which
could
pretend
to
vie
with
her
in
antiquity
in
sanctity
in
universality
the
papacy
saw
herself
exalted
to
rule
alone
over
the
kings
of
the
earth
of
that
overthrow
following
with
terrible
suddenness

the
days

it
happened
strangely
enough
that
just
while
their
ruin
was
preparing
the
house
of
swabia
gained
over
their
ecclesiastical
foes
what
seemed
likely
to
prove
an
advantage
of
the
first
moment
the
son
and
successor
of
barbarossa
was
henry
vi
a
man
who
had
inherited
all
his
father
harshness
with
none
of
his
father
generosity
by
his
marriage
with
constance
the
heiress
of
the
norman
kings
he
had
become
master
of
naples
and
sicily
emboldened
by
the
possession
of
what
had
been
hitherto
the
stronghold
of
his
predecessors
bitterest
enemies
and
able
to
threaten
the
pope
from
south
as
well
as
north
henry
conceived
a
scheme
which
might
have
wonderfully
changed
the
history
of
germany
and
italy
he
proposed
to
the
teutonic
magnates
to
lighten
their
burdens
by
uniting
these
countries
to
the
empire
to
turn
their
feudal
lands
into
allodial
and
to
make
no
further
demands
for
money
on
the
clergy
on
condition
that
they
should
pronounce
the
crown
hereditary
in
his
family
results
of
the
highest
importance
would
have
followed
this
change
which
henry
advocated
by
setting
forth
the
perils
of
interregna
and
which
he
doubtless
meant
to
be
but
part
of
an
entirely
new
system
of
polity
already
so
strong
in
germany
and
with
an
absolute
command
of
their
new
kingdom
the
hohenstaufen
might
have
dispensed
with
the
renounced
feudal
services
and
built
up
a
firm
centralized
system
like
that
which
was
already
beginning
to
develope
itself
in
france
first
however
the
saxon
princes
then
some
ecclesiastics
headed
by
conrad
of
mentz
opposed
the
scheme
the
pontiff
retracted
his
consent
and
henry
had
to
content
himself
with
getting
his
infant
son
frederick
the
second
chosen
king
of
the
romans
on
henry
untimely
death
the
election
was
set
aside
and
the
contest
which
followed
between
otto
of
brunswick
and
philip
of
hohenstaufen
brother
of
henry
the
sixth
gave
the
popedom
now
guided
by
the
genius
of
innocent
the
third
an
opportunity
of
extending
its
sway
at
the
expense
of
its
antagonist
the
pope
moved
heaven
and

on

of
otto
whose
family
had
been
the
constant
rivals
of

hohenstaufen
and

was
himself
willing
to
promise
all
that

required

became

if

was
a

by

his
acts

along
with

were
other
gifts
inherited
perhaps
from

fostered
by

in
their

the
magnates
could
usurp
the
difficulty
which
the
monarch
returning
found
in
resuming
the
privileges
of
his
crown
the
temptation
to
revolt
and
set
up
pretenders
to
the

the

these
were
the
causes

action
laid
the
foundation
of
that
territorial
independence
which
rose
into
a
stable
fabric
at
the
era
of
the
great
interregnum
frederick
ii
had
by
two
pragmatic
sanctions
and
granted
or
rather
confirmed
rights
already
customary
such
as
to
give
the
bishops
and
nobles
legal
sovereignty
in
their
own
towns
and
territories
except
when
the
emperor
should
be
present
and
thus
his
direct
jurisdiction
became
restricted
to
his
narrowed
domain
and
to
the
cities
immediately
dependent
on
the
crown
with
so
much
less
to
do
an
emperor
became
altogether
a
less
necessary
personage
and
hence
the
seven
magnates
of
the
realm
now
by
law
or
custom
sole
electors
were
in
no
haste
to
fill
up
the
place
of
conrad

the
supporters
of
his
father
frederick
had
acknowledged
william
of
holland
was
in
the
field
but
rejected
by
the
swabian
party
on
his
death
a
new
election
was
called
for
and
at
last
set
on
foot
the
archbishop
of
cologne
advised
his
brethren
to
choose
some
one
rich
enough
to
support
the
dignity
not
strong
enough
to
be
feared
by
the
electors
both
requisites
met
in

richard

of

four
votes
came
to
germany
and
was
crowned
at
aachen
but
three
of
the
electors
finding
that
his
bribe
to
them
was
lower
than
to
the
others
seceded
in
disgust
and
chose
alfonso
x
of
castile
who
shrewder
than
his
competitor
continued
to
watch
the
stars
at
toledo
enjoying
the
splendours
of
his
title
while
troubling
himself
about
it
no
further
than
to
issue
now
and
then
a
proclamation
meantime
the
condition
of
germany
was
frightful
the
new
didius
julianus
the
chosen
of
princes
baser
than
the
prætorians
whom
they
copied
had
neither
the
character
nor
the
outward
power
and
resources
to
make
himself
respected
every
floodgate
of
anarchy
was
opened
prelates
and
barons
extended
their
domains
by
war
infested
the
highways
and
the
rivers
the
misery
of
the
weak
the
tyranny
and
violence
of
the
strong
were
such
as
had
not
been
seen
for
centuries
things
were
even
worse
than
under
the
saxon
and
franconian
emperors
for
the
petty
nobles
who
had
then
been
in
some
measure
controlled
by
their
dukes
were
now
after
the
extinction
of
the
great
houses
left
without
any
feudal
superior
only
in
the
cities
was
shelter
or
peace
to
be
found
those
of
the
rhine
had
already
leagued
themselves
for
mutual
defence
and
maintained
a
struggle
in
the
interests
of
commerce
and
order
against
universal
brigandage
at
last
when
richard
had
been
some
time
dead
it
was
felt
that
such
things
could
not
go
on
for
ever
with
no
public
law
and
no
courts
of
justice
an
emperor
the
embodiment
of
legal
government
was
the
only
resource
the
pope
himself
having
now
sufficiently
improved
the
weakness
of
his
enemy
found
the
disorganization
of
germany
beginning
to
tell
upon
his
revenues
and
threatened
that
if
the
electors
did
not
appoint
an
emperor
he
would
thus
urged
they
chose
in
rudolf
count
of
hapsburg
founder
of
the
house
of
austria
sidenote
change
in
the
position
of
the
empire
from
this
point
there
begins
a
new
era
we
have
seen
the
roman
empire
revived
in
by
a
prince
whose
vast
dominions
gave
ground
to
his
claim
of
universal
monarchy
again
erected
in
on
the
narrower
but
firmer
basis
of
the
german
kingdom
we
have
seen
otto
the
great
and
his
successors
during
the
three
following
centuries
a
line
of
monarchs
of
unrivalled
vigour
and
abilities
strain
every
nerve
to
make
good
the
pretensions
of
their
office
against
the
rebels
in
italy
and
the
ecclesiastical
power
those
efforts
had
now
failed
signally
and
hopelessly
each
successive
emperor
had
entered
the
strife
with
resources
scantier
than
his
predecessors
each
had
been
more
decisively
vanquished
by
the
pope
the
cities
and
the
princes
the
roman
empire
might
and
so
far
as
its
practical
utility
was
concerned
ought
now
to
have
been
suffered
to
expire
nor
could
it
have
ended
more
gloriously
than
with
the
last
of
the
hohenstaufen
that
it
did
not
so
expire
but
lived
on
six
hundred
years
more
till
it
became
a
piece
of
antiquarianism
hardly
more
venerable
than
ridiculous
till
as
voltaire
said
all
that
could
be
said
about
it
was
that
it
was
neither
holy
nor
roman
nor
an
empire
was
owing
partly
indeed
to
the
belief
still
unshaken
that
it
was
a
necessary
part
of
the
world
order
yet
chiefly
to
its
connection
which
was
by
this
time
indissoluble
with
the
german
kingdom
the
germans
had
confounded
the
two
characters
of
their
sovereign
so
long
and
had
grown
so
fond
of
the
style
and
pretensions
of
a
dignity
whose
possession
appeared
to
exalt
them
above
the
other
peoples
of
europe
that
it
was
now
too
late
for
them
to
separate
the
local
from
the
universal
monarch
if
a
german
king
was
to
be
maintained
at
all
he
must
be
roman
emperor
and
a
german
king
there
must
still
be
deeply
nay
mortally
wounded
as
the
event
proved
his
power
to
have
been
by
the
disasters
of
the
empire
to
which
it
had
been
linked
the
time
was
by
no
means
come
for
its
extinction
in
the
unsettled
state
of
society
and
the
conflict
of
innumerable
petty
potentates
no
force
save
feudalism
was
able
to
hold
society
together
and
its
efficacy
for
that
purpose
depended
as
the
anarchy
of
the
recent
interregnum
shewed
upon
the
presence
of
the
recognized
feudal
head
sidenote
decline
of
the
regal
power
in
germany
as
compared
with
france
and
england
that
head
however
was
no
longer
what
he
had
been
the
relative
position
of
germany
and
france
was
now
exactly
the
reverse
of
that
which
they
had
occupied
two
centuries
earlier
rudolf
was
as
conspicuously
a
weaker
sovereign
than
philip
iii
of
france
as
the
franconian
emperor
henry
iii
had
been
stronger
than
the
capetian
philip
i
in
every
other
state
of
europe
the
tendency
of
events
had
been
to
centralize
the
administration
and
increase
the
power
of
the
monarch
even
in
england
not
to
diminish
it
in
germany
alone
had
political
union
become
weaker
and
the
independence
of
the
princes
more
confirmed
the
causes
of
this
change
are
not
far
to
seek
they
all
resolve
themselves
into
this
one
that
the
german
king
attempted
too
much
at
once
the
rulers
of
france
where
manners
were
less
rude
than
in
the
other
transalpine
lands
and
where
the
third
estate
rose
into
power
more
quickly
had
reduced
one
by
one
the
great
feudataries
by
whom
the
first
capetians
had
been
scarcely
recognized
the
english
kings
had
annexed
wales
cumbria
and
part
of
ireland
had
obtained
a
prerogative
great
if
not
uncontrolled
and
exercised
no
doubtful
sway
through
every
corner
of
their
country
both
had
won
their
successes
by
the
concentration
on
that
single
object
of
their
whole
personal
activity
and
by
the
skilful
use
of
every
device
whereby
their
feudal
rights
personal
judicial
and
legislative
could
be
applied
to
fetter
the
vassal
meantime
the
german
monarch
whose
utmost
efforts
it
would
have
needed
to
tame
his
fierce
barons
and
maintain
order
through
wide
territories
occupied
by
races
unlike
in
dialect
and
customs
had
been
struggling
with
the
lombard
cities
and
the
normans
of
south
italy
and
had
been
for
full
two
centuries
the
object
of
the
unrelenting
enmity
of
the
roman
pontiff
and
in
this
latter
contest
by
which
more
than
by
any
other
the
fate
of
the
empire
was
decided
he
fought
under
disadvantages
far
greater
than
his
brethren
in
england
and
france
william
the
conqueror
had
defied
hildebrand
william
rufus
had
resisted
anselm
but
the
emperors
henry
the
fourth
and
barbarossa
had
to
cope
with
prelates
who
were
hildebrand
and
anselm
in
one
the
spiritual
heads
of
christendom
as
well
as
the
primates
of
their
special
realm
the
empire
and
thus
while
the
ecclesiastics
of
germany
were
a
body
more
formidable
from
their
possessions
than
those
of
any
other
european
country
and
enjoying
far
larger
privileges
the
emperor
could
not
or
could
with
far
less
effect
win
them
over
by
invoking
against
the
pope
that
national
feeling
which
made
the
cry
of
gallican
liberties
so
welcome
even
to
the
clergy
of
france
sidenote
relations
of

from
being
able
to
look
down
on
the
papal
could
not
even
maintain
itself
on
an
equal
footing
against
no
pontiff
since
gregory
vii
had
the
monarch
right
to
name
or
confirm
a
pope
undisputed
in
the
days
of
the
ottos
and
of
henry
iii
been
made
good
it
was
the
turn
of
the
emperor
to
repel
a
similar
claim
of
the
holy
see
to
the
function
of
reviewing
his
own
election
examining
into
his
merits
and
rejecting
him
if
unsound
that
is
to
say
impatient
of
priestly
tyranny
a
letter
of
innocent
iii
who
was
the
first
to
make
this
demand
in
terms
was
inserted
by
gregory
ix
in
his
digest
of
the
canon
law
the
inexhaustible
armoury
of
the
churchman
and
continued
to
be
quoted
thence
by
every
canonist
till
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
it
was
not
difficult
to
find
grounds
on
which
to
base
such
a
doctrine
gregory
vii
deduced
it
with
characteristic
boldness
from
the
power
of
the
keys
and
the
superiority
over
all
other
dignities
which
must
needs
appertain
to
the
pope
as
arbiter
of
eternal
weal
or
woe
others
took
their
stand
on
the
analogy
of
clerical
ordination
and
urged
that
since
the
pope
in
consecrating
the
emperor
gave
him
a
title
to
the
obedience
of
all
christian
men
he
must
have
himself
the
right
of
approving
or
rejecting
the
candidate
according
to
his
merits
others
again
appealing
to
the
old
testament
shewed
how
samuel
discarded
saul
and
anointed
david
in
his
room
and
argued
that
the
pope
now
must
have
powers
at
least
equal
to
those
of
the
hebrew
prophets
but
the
ascendancy
of
the
doctrine
dates
from
the
time
of
pope
innocent
iii
whose
ingenuity
discovered
for
it
an
historical
basis
it
was
by
the
favour
of
the
pope
he
declared
that
the
empire
was
taken
away
from
the
greeks
and
given
to
the
germans
in
the
person
of
charles
and
the
authority
which
leo
then
exercised
as
representative
must
abide
thenceforth
and
for
ever
in
his
successors
who
can
therefore
at
any
time
recall
the
gift
and
bestow
it
on
a
person
or
a
nation
more
worthy
than
its
present
holders
this
is
the
famous
theory
of
the
translation
of
the
empire
which
plays
so
large
a
part
in
controversy
down
till
the
seventeenth
century
a
theory
with
plausibility
enough
to
make
it
generally
successful
yet
one
which
to
an
impartial
eye
appears
far
removed
from
the
truth
of
the
facts
leo
iii
did
not
suppose
any
more
than
did
charles
himself
that
it
was
by
his
sole
pontifical
authority
that
the
crown
was
given
to
the
frank
nor
do
we
find
such
a
notion
put
forward
by
any
of
his
successors
down
to
the
twelfth
century
gregory
vii
in
particular
in
a
remarkable
letter
dilating
on
his
prerogative
appeals
to
the
substitution
by
papal
interference
of
pipin
for
the
last
merovingian
king
and
even
goes
back
to
cite
the
case
of
theodosius
humbling
himself
before
ambrose
but
says
never
a
word
about
this
excellently
as
it
would
have
served
his
purpose
sound
or
unsound
however
these
arguments
did
their
work
for
they
were
urged
skilfully
and
boldly
and
none
denied
that
it
was
by
the
pope
alone
that
the
crown
could
be
lawfully
imposed
in
some
instances
the
rights
claimed
were
actually
made
good
thus
innocent
iii
withstood
philip
and
overthrew
otto
iv
thus
another
haughty
priest
commanded
the
electors
to
choose
the
landgrave
of
thuringia
and
was
by
some
of
them
obeyed
thus
gregory
x
compelled
the
recognition
of
rudolf
the
further
pretensions
of
the
popes
to
the
vicariate
of
the
empire
during
interregna
the
germans
never
admitted
still
their
place
was
now
generally
felt
to
be
higher
than
that
of
the
monarch
and
their
control
over
the
three
spiritual
electors
and
the
whole
body
of
the
clergy
was
far
more
effective
than
his
a
spark
of
national
feeling
was
at
length
kindled
by
the
exactions
and
shameless
subservience
to

while
in

the
principle

due
to

the
wish
of

to
gain
an

they

arrangements
under
which
disputed
elections
became
far
less
frequent
remained
undisturbed
till
when
on
the
breaking
out
of
the
thirty
years
war
the
emperor
ferdinand
ii
by
an
unwarranted
stretch
of
prerogative
deprived
the
palsgrave
frederick
king
of
bohemia
and
husband
of
elizabeth
the
daughter
of
james
i
of
england
of
his
electoral
vote
and
transferred
it
to
his
own
partisan
maximilian
of
bavaria
at
the
peace
of
westphalia
the
palsgrave
was
reinstated
as
an
eighth
elector
bavaria
retaining
her
place
the
sacred
number
having
been
once
broken
through
less
scruple
was
felt
in
making
further
changes
in
the
emperor
leopold

conferred
a
ninth
electorate
on
the
house
of
brunswick
lüneburg
which
was
then
in
possession
of
the
duchy
of
hanover
and
succeeded
to
the
throne
of
great
britain
in
and
in
the
assent
of
the
diet
thereto
was
obtained
it
was
in
this
way
that
english
kings
came
to
vote
at
the
election
of
a
roman
emperor
it
is
not
a
little
curious
that
the
only
potentate
who
still
continues
to
entitle
himself
elector
should
be
one
who
never
did
and
of
course
never
can
now
join
in
electing
an
emperor
having
been
under
the
arrangements
of
the
old
empire
a
simple
landgrave
in
napoleon
among
other
sweeping
changes
in
the
germanic
constitution
procured
the
extinction
of
the
electorates
of
cologne
and
treves
annexing
their
territories
to
france
and
gave
the
title
of
elector
as
the
highest
after
that
of
king
to
the
duke
of
würtemburg
the
margrave
of
baden
the
landgrave
of
and
the
archbishop
of
salzburg
three
years
afterwards
the
empire
itself
ended
and
the
title
became
meaningless
as
the
germanic
empire
is
the
most
conspicuous
example
of
a
monarchy
not
hereditary
that
the
world
has
ever
seen
it
may
not
be
amiss
to
consider
for
a
moment
what
light
its
history
throws
upon
the
character
of
elective
monarchy
in
general
a
contrivance
which
has
always
had
and
will
probably
always
continue
to
have
seductions
for
a
certain
class
of
political
theorists
sidenote
objects
of
an
elective
monarchy
how
far
attained
in
germany
sidenote
choice
of
the
fittest
first
of
all
then
it
deserves
to
be
noticed
how
difficult
one
might
almost
say
impossible
it
was
found
to
maintain
in
practice
the
elective
principle
in
point
of
law
the
imperial
throne
was
from
the
tenth
century
to
the
nineteenth
absolutely
open
to
any
orthodox
christian
candidate
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
competition
was
confined
to
a
few
very
powerful
families
and
there
was
always
a
strong
tendency
for
the
crown
to
become
hereditary
in
some
one
of
these
thus
the
franconian
emperors
held
it
from
till
the
hohenstaufen
themselves
the
heirs
of
the
franconians
for
a
century
or
more
the
house
of
luxemburg
kings
of
bohemia
enjoyed
it
through
three
successive
reigns
and
when
in
the
fifteenth
century
it
fell
into
the
tenacious
grasp
of
the
hapsburgs
they
managed
to
retain
it
thenceforth
with
but
one
trifling
interruption
till
it
vanished
out
of
nature
altogether
therefore
the
chief
benefit
which
the
scheme
of
elective
sovereignty
seems
to
promise
that
of
putting
the
fittest
man
in
the
highest
place
was
but
seldom
attained
and
attained
even
then
rather
by
good
fortune
than
design
sidenote
restraint
of
the
sovereign
no
such
objection
can
be
brought
against
the
second
ground
on
which
an
elective
system
has
sometimes
been
advocated
its
operation
in
moderating
the
power
of
the
crown
for
this
was
attained
in
the
fullest
and
most
ruinous
measure
we
are
reminded
of
the
man
in
the
fable
who
opened
a
sluice
to
water
his
garden
and
saw
his
house
swept
away
by
the
furious
torrent
the
power
of
the
crown
was
not
moderated
but
destroyed
each
successful
candidate
was
forced
to
purchase
his
title
by
the
sacrifice
of
rights
which
had
belonged
to
his
predecessors
and
must
repeat
the
same
shameful
policy
later
in
his
reign
to
procure
the
election
of
his
son
feeling
at
the
same
time
that
his
family
could
not
make
sure
of
keeping
the
throne
he
treated
it
as
a
is
apt
to
treat
his
estate
seeking
only
to
make
out
of
it
the
largest
present
profit
and
the
electors
aware
of
the
strength
of
their
position
presumed
upon
it
and
abused
it
to
assert
an
independence
such
as
the
nobles
of
other
countries
could
never
have
aspired
to
sidenote
recognition
of
the
popular
will
sidenote
conception
of
the
electoral
function
modern
political
speculation
supposes
the
method
of
appointing
a
ruler
by
the
votes
of
his
subjects
as
opposed
to
the
system
of
hereditary
succession
to
be
an
assertion
by
the
people
of
their
own
will
as
the
ultimate
fountain
of
authority
an
acknowledgment
by
the
prince
that
he
is
no
more
than
their
minister
and
deputy
to
the
theory
of
the
holy
empire
nothing
could
be
more
repugnant
this
will
best
appear
when
the
aspect
of
the
system
of
election
at
different
epochs
in
its
history
is
compared
with
the
corresponding
changes
in
the
composition
of
the
electoral
body
which
have
been
described
as
in
progress
from
the
ninth
to
the
fourteenth
century
in
very
early
times
the
tribe
chose
a
war
chief
who
was
even
if
he
belonged
to
the
most
noble
family
no
more
than
the
first
among
his
peers
with
a
power
circumscribed
by
the
will
of
his
subjects
several
ages
later
in
the
tenth
and
eleventh
centuries
the
right
of
choice
had
passed
into
the
hands
of
the
magnates
and
the
people
were
only
asked
to
assent
in
the
same
measure
had
the
relation
of
prince
and
subject
taken
a
new
aspect
we
must
not
expect
to
find
in
such
rude
times
any
very
clear
apprehension
of
the
technical
quality
of
the
process
and
the
throne
had
indeed
become
for
a
season
so
nearly
hereditary
that
the
election
was
often
a
mere
matter
of
form
but
it
seems
to
have
been
regarded
not
as
a
delegation
of
authority
by
the
nobles
and
people
with
a
power
of
resumption
implied
but
rather
as
their
subjection
of
themselves
to
the
monarch
who
enjoys
as
of
his
own
right
a
wide
and
prerogative
in
yet
later
times
when
as
has
been
shewn
above
the
assembly
of
the
chieftains
and
the
applauding
shout
of
the
host
had
been
superseded
by
the
secret
conclave
of
the
seven
electoral
princes
the
strict
legal
view
of
election
became
fully
established
and
no
one
was
supposed
to
have
any
title
to
the
crown
except
what
a
majority
of
votes
might
confer
upon
him
meantime
however
the
conception
of
the
imperial
office
itself
had
been
thoroughly
penetrated
by
religious
ideas
and
the
fact
that
the
sovereign
did
not
like
other
princes
reign
by
hereditary
right
but
by
the
choice
of
certain
persons
was
supposed
to
be
an
enhancement
and
consecration
of
his
dignity
the
electors
to
draw
what
may
seem
a
subtle
but
is
nevertheless
a
very
real
distinction
selected
but
did
not
create
they
only
named
the
person
who
was
to
receive
what
it
was
not
theirs
to
give
god
say
the
mediæval
writers
not
deigning
to
interfere
visibly
in
the
affairs
of
this
world
has
willed
that
these
seven
princes
of
germany
should
discharge
the
function
which
once
belonged
to
the
senate
and
people
of
rome
that
of
choosing
his
earthly
viceroy
in
matters
temporal
but
it
is
immediately
from
himself
that
the
authority
of
this
viceroy
comes
and
men
can
have
no
relation
towards
him
except
that
of
obedience
it
was
in
this
period
therefore
when
the
emperor
was
in
practice
the
mere
nominee
of
the
electors
that
the
belief
in
this
divine
right
stood
highest
to
the
complete
exclusion
of
the
mutual
responsibility
of
feudalism
and
still
more
of
any
notion
of
a
devolution
of
authority
from
the
sovereign

these
seven
electoral
princes
acquired
with

marked
and

public
acts

were

to
be
sacred
and
the
seven
mystic
luminaries
of
the
holy

typified
by
the
seven
lamps
of
the
apocalypse
soon
gained
much
of
the

on
popular
reverence
as
well
as
that
actual
power
which
he
lacked
to
charles
who
viewed
the
german
empire
much
as
rudolf
had
viewed

this
result
came
not

in
his
office
a
means
of
serving
personal
ends
and
to
them
while
appearing
to
exalt
by
elaborate
ceremonies
its
ideal
dignity
he
deliberately
sacrificed
what
real
strength
was
left
the
object
which
he
sought
steadily
through
life
was
the
prosperity
of
the
bohemian
kingdom
and
the
advancement
of
his
own
house

thus
alike
at

the
german
king
had
become
practically
powerless
by
the
loss
of
his
feudal
privileges
and
saw
the
authority
that

parcelled
out

in
so
far
as
it
was
anything
more
than
a
tradition
from
times
gone
by
rested
solely
upon
the
belief
that
with
the
visible
church
there
must
be
coextensive
a
single
christian
state
under
one
head
and
governor
but
now
that
the
emperor
headship
had
been
repudiated
by
the
pope
and
his
interference
in
matters
of
religion
denounced
as
a
repetition
of
the
sin
of
uzziah
now
that
the
memory
of
mutual
injuries
had
kindled
an
unquenchable
hatred
between
the
champions
of
the
ecclesiastical
and
those
of
the
civil
power
it
was
natural
that
the
latter
while
they
urged
fervently
as
ever
the
divine
sanction
given
to
the
imperial
office
should
at
the
same
time
be
led
to
seek
some
further
basis
whereon
to
establish
its
claims
what
that
basis
was
and
how
they
were
guided
to
it
will
best
appear
when
a
word
or
two
has
been
said
on
the
nature
of
the
change
that
had
passed
on
europe
in
the
course
of
the
three
preceding
centuries
and
the
progress
of
the
human
mind
during
the
same
period
sidenote
revival
of
learning
and
literature
such
has
been
the
accumulated
wealth
of
literature
and
so
rapid
the
advances
of
science
among
us
since
the
close
of
the
middle
ages
that
it
is
not
now
possible
by
any
effort
fully
to
enter
into
the
feelings
with
which
the
relics
of
antiquity
were
regarded
by
those
who
saw
in
them
their
only
possession
it
is
indeed
true
that
modern
art
and
literature
and
philosophy
have
been
produced
by
the
working
of
new
minds
upon
old
materials
that
in
thought
as
in
nature
we
see
no
new
creation
but
with
us
the
old
has
been
transformed
and
overlaid
by
the
new
till
its
origin
is
forgotten
to
them
ancient
books
were
the
only
standard
of
taste
the
only
vehicle
of
truth
the
only
stimulus
to
reflection
hence
it
was
that
the
most
learned
man
was
in
those
days
esteemed
the
greatest
hence
the
creative
energy
of
an
age
was
exactly
proportioned
to
its
knowledge
of
and
its
reverence
for
the
written
monuments
of
those
that
had
gone
before
for
until
they
can
look
forward
men
must
look
back
till
they
should
have
reached
the
level
of
the
old
civilization
the
nations
of
mediæval
europe
must
continue
to
live
upon
its
memories
over
them
as
over
us
the
common
dream
of
all
mankind
had
power
but
to
them
as
to
the
ancient
world
that
golden
age
which
seems
now
to
glimmer
on
the
horizon
of
the
future
was
shrouded
in
the
clouds
of
the
past
it
is
to
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
centuries
that
we
are
accustomed
to
assign
that
new
birth
of
the
human
spirit
if
it
ought
not
rather
to
be
called
a
renewal
of
its
strength
and
quickening
of
its
sluggish
life
with
which
the
modern
time
begins
and
the
date
is
well
chosen
for
it
was
then
first
that
the
transcendently
powerful
influence
of
greek
literature
began
to
work
upon
the
world
but
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
for
a
long
time
previous
there
had
been
in
progress
a
great
revival
of
learning
and
still
more
of
zeal
for
learning
which
being
caused
by
and
directed
towards
the
literature
and
institutions
of
rome
might
fitly
be
called
the
roman
renaissance
the
twelfth
century
saw
this
revival
begin
with
that
passionate
study
of
the
legislation
of
justinian
whose
influence
on
the
doctrines
of
imperial
prerogative
has
been
noticed
already
the
thirteenth
witnessed
the
rapid
spread
of
the
scholastic
philosophy
a
body
of
systems
most
alien
both
in
subject
and
manner
to
anything
that
had
arisen
among
the
ancients
yet
one
to
whose
development
greek
metaphysics
and
the
theology
of
the
latin
fathers
had
largely
contributed
and
the
spirit
of
whose
reasonings
was
far
more
free
than
the
presumed
orthodoxy
of
its
conclusions
suffered
to
appear
in
the
fourteenth
century
there
arose
in
italy
the
first
great
masters
of
painting
and
song
and
the
literature
of
the
new
languages
springing
into
the
fulness
of
life
in
the
divina
commedia
adorned
not
long
after
by
the
names
of
petrarch
and
chaucer
assumed
at
once
its
place
as
a
great
and
power
in

now
along
with
the

revival
partly
caused

partly
causing
it
there
had
been
also
a
wonderful
stirring
and
uprising
in
the
mind
of
europe
the
yoke
of
church
authority
still
pressed
heavily
on
the
souls
of
men
yet
some
had
been
found
to
shake
it
off
and
many
more
murmured
in
secret
the
tendency
was
one
which
shewed
itself
in
various
and
sometimes
apparently
opposite
directions
the
revolt
of
the
albigenses
the
spread
of
the
cathari
and
other
heretics
the
excitement
created
by
the
writings
of
wickliffe
and
huss
witnessed
to
the
fearlessness
wherewith
it
could
assail
the
dominant
theology
it
was
present
however
skilfully
disguised
among
those
scholastic
doctors
who
busied
themselves
with
proving
by
natural
reason
the
dogmas
of
the
church
for
the
power
which
can
forge
fetters
can
also
break
them
it
took
a
form
more
dangerous
because
of
a
more
direct
application
to
facts
in
the
attacks
so
often
repeated
from
arnold
of
brescia
downwards
upon
the
wealth
and
corruptions
of
the
clergy
and
above
all
of
the
papal
court
for
the
agitation
was
not
merely
speculative
there
was
beginning
to
be
a
direct
and
rational
interest
in
life
a
power
of
applying
thought
to
practical
ends
which
had
not
been
seen
before

life
among
his
fellows
was
no
longer
a
mere
wild
beast

no
more
as
it
had
been
the
victim
of
ungoverned
passion
whether
it
was
awed
by
supernatural
terrors
or
captivated
by
examples
of
surpassing
holiness
manners
were
still
rude
and
governments
unsettled
but
society
was
learning
to
organize
itself
upon
fixed
principles
to
recognize
however
faintly
the
value
of
order
industry
equality
to
adapt
means
to
ends
and
conceive
of
the
common
good
as
the
proper
end
of
its
own
existence
in
a
word
politics
had
begun
to
exist
and
with
them
there
had
appeared
the
first
of
a
class
of
persons
whom
friends
and
enemies
may
both
though
with
different
meanings
call
ideal
politicians
men
who
however
various
have
been
the
doctrines
they
have
held
however
impracticable
many
of
the
plans
they
have
advanced
have
been
nevertheless
alike
in
their
devotion
to
the
highest
interests
of
humanity
and
have
frequently
been
derided
as
theorists
in
their
own
age
to
be
honoured
as
the
prophets
and
teachers
of
the
next
sidenote
separation
of
the
peoples
of
europe
into
hostile
kingdoms
consequent
need
of
an
international
power
now
it
was
towards
the
roman
empire
that
the
hopes
and
sympathies
of
these
political
speculators
as
well
as
of
the
jurists
and
poets
of
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
centuries
were
constantly
directed
the
cause
may
be
gathered
from
the
circumstances
of
the
time
the
most
remarkable
event
in
the
history
of
the
last
three
hundred
years
had
been
the
formation
of
nationalities
each
distinguished
by
a
peculiar
language
and
character
and
by
steadily
increasing
differences
of
habits
and
institutions
and
as
upon
this
national
basis
there
had
been
in
most
cases
established
strong
monarchies
europe
was
broken
up
into
disconnected
bodies
and
the
cherished
scheme
of
a
united
christian
state
appeared
less
likely
than
ever
to
be
realized
nor
was
this
all
sometimes
through
more
often
by
the
jealousy
and
ambition
of
their
sovereigns
these
countries
were
constantly
involved
in
war
with
one
another
violating
on
a
larger
scale
and
with
more
destructive
results
than
in
time
past
the
peace
of
the
religious
community
while
each
of
them
was
at
the
same
time
torn
within
by
frequent
insurrections
and
desolated
by
long
and
bloody
civil
wars
the
new
nationalities
were
too
fully
formed
to
allow
the
hope
that
by
their
extinction
a
remedy
might
be
applied
to
these
evils
they
had
grown
up
in
spite
of
the
empire
and
the
church
and
were
not
likely
to
yield
in
their
strength
what
they
had
won
in
their
weakness
but
it
still
appeared
possible
to
soften
if
not
to
overcome
their
antagonism
what
might
not
be
looked
for
from
the
erection
of
a
presiding
power
common
to
all
europe
a
power
which
while
it
should
oversee
the
internal
concerns
of
each
country
not
dethroning
the
king
but
treating
him
as
an
hereditary
viceroy
should
be
more
especially
charged
to
prevent
strife
between
kingdoms
and
to
maintain
the
public
order
of
europe
by
being
not
only
the
fountain
of
international
law
but
also
the
judge
in
its
causes
and
the
enforcer
of
its
sentences
sidenote
the
popes
as
international
judges
to
such
a
position
had
the
popes
aspired
they
were
indeed
excellently
fitted
for
it
by
the
respect
which
the
sacredness
of
their
office
commanded
by
their
control
of
the
tremendous
weapons
of
excommunication
and
interdict
above
all
by
their
exemption
from
those
narrowing
influences
of
place
or
blood
or
personal
interest
which
it
would
be
their
chiefest
duty
to
resist
in
others
and
there
had
been
pontiffs
whose
fearlessness
and
justice
were
worthy
of
their
exalted
office
and
whose
interference
was
gratefully
remembered
by
those
who
found
no
other
helpers
nevertheless
judging
the
papacy
by
its
conduct
as
a
whole
it
had
been
tried
and
found
wanting
even
when
its
throne
stood
firmest
and
its
purposes
were
most
pure
one
motive
had
always
biassed
its
decisions
a
partiality
to
the
most
submissive
during
the
greater
part
of
the
fourteenth
century
it
was
at
avignon
the
willing
tool
of
france
in
the
pursuit
of
a
temporal
principality
it
had
mingled
in
and
been
contaminated
by
the
unhallowed
politics
of
italy
its
supreme
council
the
college
of
cardinals
was
distracted
by
the
intrigues
of
two
bitterly
hostile
factions
and
while
the
power
of
the
popes
had
declined
steadily
though
silently
since
the
days
of
boniface
the
eighth
the
insolence
of
the
great
prelates
and
the
vices
of
the
inferior
clergy
had
provoked
throughout
western
christendom
a
reaction
against
the
pretensions
of
all
sacerdotal
authority
as
there
is
no
theory
at
first
sight
more
attractive
than
that
which
entrusts
all
government
to
a
supreme
spiritual
power
which
knowing
what
is
best
for
man
shall
lead
him
to
his
true
good
by
appealing
to
the
highest
principles
of
his
nature
so
there
is
no
disappointment
more
bitter
than
that
of
those
who
find
that
the
holiest
office
may
be
polluted
by
the
lusts
and
passions
of
its
holder
that
craft
and
hypocrisy
lead
while
fanaticism
follows
that
here
too
as
in
so
much
else
the
corruption
of
the
best
is
worst
some
such
disappointment
there
was
in
europe
now
and
with
it
a
certain
disposition
to
look
with
favour
on
the
secular
power
a
wish
to
escape
from
the
unhealthy
atmosphere
of
clerical
despotism
to
the
rule
of
positive
law
harsher
it
might
be
yet
surely
less
corrupting
espousing
the
cause
of
the
roman
empire
as
the
chief
opponent
of
priestly
claims
this
tendency
found
it
with
shrunken
territory
and
diminished
resources
fitter
in
some
respects
for
the
office
of
an
international
judge
and
mediator
than
it
had
been
as
a
great
national
power
for
though
far
less
widely
active
it
was
losing
that
local
character
which
was
fast
gathering
round
the
papacy
with
feudal
rights
no
longer
enforcible
and
removed
except
in
his
patrimonial
lands
from
direct
contact
with
the
subject
the
emperor
was
not
as
heretofore
conspicuously
a
german
and
a
feudal
king
and
occupied
an
ideal
position
far
less
marred
by
the
incongruous
accidents
of
birth
and
training
of
national
and
dynastic
interests
sidenote
duties
attributed
to
the
empire
by
the
developed
theory
sidenote
divine
right
of
the
emperor
to
that
position
three
cardinal
duties
were
attached
he
who
held
it
must
typify
spiritual
unity
must
preserve
peace
must
be
a
fountain
of
that
by
which
alone
among
imperfect
men
peace
is
preserved
and
restored
law
and
justice
the
first
of
these
three
objects
was
sought
not
only
on
religious
grounds
but
also
from
that
longing
for
a
wider
brotherhood
of
humanity
towards
which
ever
since
the
barrier
between
jew
and
gentile
greek
and
barbarian
was
broken
down
the
aspirations
of
the
higher
minds
of
the
world
have
been
constantly
directed
placed
in
the
midst
of
europe
the
emperor
was
to
bind
its
tribes
into
one
body
reminding
them
of
their
common
faith
their
common
blood
their
common
interest
in
each
other
welfare
and
he
was
therefore
above
all
things
professing
indeed
to
be
upon
earth
the
representative
of
the
prince
of
peace
bound
to
listen
to
complaints
and
to
redress
the
injuries
inflicted
by
sovereigns
or
people
upon
each
other
to
punish
offenders
against
the
public
order
of
christendom
to
maintain
through
the
world
looking
down
as
from
a
serene
height
upon
the
schemes
and
quarrels
of
meaner
potentates
that
supreme
good
without
which
neither
arts
nor
letters
nor
the
gentler
virtues
of
life
can
rise
and
flourish
the
mediæval
empire
was
in
its
essence
what
the
modern
despotisms
that
mimic
it
profess
themselves
the
empire
was
peace
the
oldest
and
noblest
title
of
its
head
was
pacificus
and
that
he
might
be
the
peacemaker
he
must
be
the
expounder
of
justice
and
the
author
of
its
concrete
embodiment
positive
law
chief
legislator
and
supreme
judge
of
appeal
like
his
predecessor
the
compiler
of
the
corpus
iuris
the
one
and
only
source
of
all
legitimate
authority
in
this
sense
as
governor
and
administrator
not
as
owner
is
he
in
the
words
of
the
jurists
lord
of
the
world
not
that
its
soil
belongs
to
him
in
the
same
sense
in
which
the
soil
of
france
or
england
belongs
to
their
respective
kings
he
is
the
steward
of
him
who
has
received
the
heathen
for
his
possession
and
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
earth
for
his
inheritance
it
is
therefore
by
him
alone
that
the
idea
of
pure
right
acquired
not
by
force
but
by
legitimate
devolution
from
those
whom
god
himself
had
set
up
is
visibly
expressed
upon
earth
to
find
an
external
and
positive
basis
for
that
idea
is
a
problem
which
it
has
at
all
times
been
more
easy
to
evade
than
to
solve
and
one
peculiarly
distressing
to
those
who
could
neither
explain
the
phenomena
of
society
by
reducing
it
to
its
original
principles
nor
inquire
historically
how
its
existing
arrangements
had
grown
up
hence
the
attempt
to
represent
human
government
as
an
emanation
from
divine
a
view
from
which
all
the
similar
but
far
less
logically
consistent
doctrines
of
divine
right
which
have
prevailed
in
later
times
are
borrowed
as
has
been
said
already
there
is
not
a
trace
of
the
notion
that
the
emperor
reigns
by
an
hereditary
right
of
his
own
or
by
the
will
of
the
people
for
such
a
theory
would
have
seemed
to
the
men
of
the
middle
ages
an
absurd
and
wicked
perversion
of
the
true
order
nor
do
his
powers
come
to
him
from
those
who
choose
him
but
from
god
who
uses
the
electoral
princes
as
mere
instruments
of
nomination
having
such
an
origin
his
rights
exist
irrespective
of
their
actual
exercise
and
no
voluntary
abandonment
not
even
an
express
grant
can
impair
them
boniface
the
eighth
reminds
the
king
of
france
and
imperialist
lawyers
till
the
seventeenth
century
repeated
the
claim
that
he
like
other
princes
is
of
right
and
must
ever
remain
subject
to
the
roman
emperor
and
the
sovereigns
of
europe
long
continued
to
address
the
emperor
in
language
and
yield
to
him
a
precedence
which
admitted
the
inferiority
of
their
own
position
there
was
in
this
theory
nothing
that
was
absurd
though
much
that
was
impracticable
the
ideas
on
which
it
rested
are
still
unapproached
in
grandeur
and
simplicity
still
as
far
in
advance
of
the
average
thought
of
europe
and
as
unlikely
to
find
men
or
nations
fit
to
apply
them
as
when
they
were
promulgated
five
hundred
years
ago
the
practical
evil
which
the
establishment
of
such
a
universal
monarchy
was
intended

is

to

the

it

distinguish
the

of
the

by
which
the
men
who
led
these

fancied

animated
was
in

a
pagan
or
at

a
strongly
secular
spirit
in
many
respects
inconsistent
with
the
associations
which
had
now
gathered
round
the
imperial
office
and
this
hostility
did
not
fail
to
shew
itself
when
at
the
beginning
of
the
sixteenth
century
in
the
fulness
of
the
renaissance
a
direct
and
for
the
time
irresistible
sway
was
exercised
by
the
art
and
literature
of
greece
when
the
mythology
of
euripides
and
ovid
supplanted
that
which
had
fired
the
imagination
of
dante
and
peopled
the
visions
of
francis
when
men
forsook
the
image
of
the
saint
in
the
cathedral
for
the
statue
of
the
nymph
in
the
garden
when
the
uncouth
jargon
of
scholastic
theology
was
equally
distasteful
to
the
scholars
who
formed
their
style
upon
cicero
and
the
philosophers
who
drew
their
inspiration
from
plato
that
meanwhile
the
admirers
of
antiquity
did
ally
themselves
with
the
defenders
of
the
empire
was
due
partly
indeed
to
the
false
notions
that
were
entertained
regarding
the
early
cæsars
yet
still
more
to
the
common
hostility
of
both
sects
to
the
papacy
it
was
as
successor
of
old
rome
and
by
virtue
of
her
traditions
that
the
holy
see
had
established
so
wide
a
dominion
yet
no
sooner
did
arnold
of
brescia
and
his
republicans
arise
claiming
liberty
in
the
name
of
the
ancient
constitution
of
the
republic
than
they
found
in
the
popes
their
bitterest
foes
and
turned
for
help
to
the
secular
monarch
against
the
clergy
with
similar
aversion
did
the
romish
court
view
the
revived
study
of
the
ancient
jurisprudence
so
soon
as
it
became
in
the
hands
of
the
school
of
bologna
and
afterwards
of
the
jurists
of
france
a
power
able
to
assert
its
independence
and
resist
ecclesiastical
pretensions
in
the
ninth
century
pope
nicholas
the
first
had
himself
judged
in
the
famous
case
of
teutberga
wife
of
lothar
according
to
the
civil
law
in
the
thirteenth
his
successors
forbade
its
study
and
the
canonists
strove
to
expel
it
from
europe
and
as
the
current
of
educated
opinion
among
the
laity
was
beginning
however
imperceptibly
at
first
to
set
against
sacerdotal
tyranny
it
followed
that
the
empire
would
find
sympathy
in
any
effort
it
could
make
to
regain
its
lost
position
thus
the
emperors
became
or
might
have
become

they
seen
the
greatness
of
the
opportunity
and
been
strong
enough
to
improve

in

at

of

but
the

came
too
late
to
arrest
if
not
to
adorn
the
decline
of
their
office
the
growth
of
a
national
sentiment
in
the
several
countries
of
europe
which
had
already
gone

to
be
arrested

urged
on
by
forces

on
the
resistance
to

usurpation
and
even
on
the
instincts
of
political
freedom
that
form
of
narrowly
local
patriotism
which
they
still
retain
it
can
hardly
be
said
that
upon
any
occasion
except
the
gathering
of
the
council
of
constance
by
sigismund
did
the
emperor
appear
filling
a
truly
international
place
for
the
most
part
he
exerted
in
the
politics
of
europe
no
influence
greater
than
that
of

stood
below

their
timidity

such
their
unwillingness
to

did
not
prevent

extolled

its
denial
was

for

forms
and
phrases
in

middle

sidenote
absence
of
the
idea
of

or
progress
and
all
this
historical
antiquarianism
as
one
might
call
it
which
gathers
round
the
empire
is
but
one
instance
though
the
most
striking
of
that
eager
wish
to
cling
to
the
old
forms
use
the
old
phrases
and
preserve
the
old
institutions
to
which
the
annals
of
mediæval
europe
bear
witness
it
appears
even
in
trivial
expressions
as
when
a
monkish
chronicler
says
of
evil
bishops
deposed
moti
or
talks
of
the
and
people
of
the
franks
when
he
means
a
council
of
chiefs
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
warriors

and
edicts
were
drawn
up
on
roman
precedents

often
traceable

a

villenage

the
offspring
of
the
system
of
under
the
later

even
in
remote

teutonic
invaders
used
roman
ensigns
and
stamped
their

roman
devices

especially
did
the

her
most

institutions

the
traveller
still
sees
emblazoned
the
imperial
eagle
with
the
words
populusque
norimbergensis
and
is
borne
in
thought
from
the
quiet
provincial
town
of
to
the
stirring
republic
of
the
middle
ages
thence
to
the
forum
and
the
capitol
of
her
greater
prototype
for
in
truth
through
all
that
period
which
we
call
the
dark
and
middle
ages
men
minds
were
possessed
by
the
belief
that
all
things
continued
as
they
were
from
the
beginning
that
no
chasm
never
to
be
recrossed
lay
between
them
and
that
ancient
world
to
which
they
had
not
ceased
to
look
back
we
who
are
centuries
removed
can
see
that
there
had
passed
a
great
and
wonderful
change
upon
thought
and
art
and
literature
and
politics
and
society
itself
a
change
whose
best
illustration
is
to
be
found
in
the
process
whereby
there
arose
out
of
the
primitive
basilica
the
romanesque
cathedral
and
from
it
in
turn
the
endless
varieties
of
gothic
but
so
gradual
was
the
change
that
each
generation
felt
it
passing
over
them
no
more
than
a
man
feels
that
perpetual
transformation
by
which
his
body
is
renewed
from
year
to
year
while
the
few
who
had
learning
enough
to
study
antiquity
through
its
contemporary
records
were
prevented
by
the
utter
want
of
criticism
and
of
that
which
we
call
historical
feeling
from
seeing
how
prodigious
was
the
contrast
between
themselves
and
those
whom
they
admired
there
is
nothing
more
modern
than
the
critical
spirit
which
dwells
upon
the
difference
between
the
minds
of
men
in
one
age
and
in
another
which
endeavours
to
make
each
age
its
own
interpreter
and
judge
what
it
did
or
produced
by
a
relative
standard
such
a
spirit
was
before
the
last
century
or
two
wholly
foreign
to
art
as
well
as
to
metaphysics
the
converse
and
the
parallel
of
the
fashion
of
calling
mediæval
offices
by
roman
names
and
supposing
them
therefore
the
same
is
to
be
found
in
those
old
german
pictures
of
the
siege
of
carthage
or
the
battle
between
porus
and
alexander
where
in
the
foreground
two
armies
of
knights
mailed
and
mounted
are
charging
each
other
like
crusaders
lance
in
rest
while
behind
through
the
smoke
of
cannon
loom
out
the
gothic
spires
and
towers
of
the
beleaguered
city
and
thus
when
we
remember
that
the
notion
of
progress
and
development
and
of
change
as
the
necessary
condition
thereof
was
unwelcome
or
unknown
in
mediæval
times
we
may
better
understand
though
we
do
not
cease
to
wonder
how
men
never
doubting
that
the
political
system
of
antiquity
had
descended
to
them
modified
indeed
yet
in
substance
the
same
should
have
believed
that
the
frank
the
saxon
and
the
swabian
ruled
all
europe
by
a
right
which
seems
to
us
not
less
fantastic
than
that
fabled
charter
whereby
alexander
the
great
bequeathed
his
empire
to
the
slavic
race
for
the
love
of
roxolana
it
is
a
part
of
that
perpetual
contradiction
of
which
the
history
of
the
middle
ages
is
full
that
this
belief
had
hardly
any
influence
on
practical
politics
the
more
abjectly
helpless
the
emperor
becomes
so
much
the
more
sonorous
is
the
language
in
which
the
dignity
of
his
crown
is
described
his
power
we
are
told
is
eternal

provinces
having
resumed
their

contumaciously

the
life
of

who
said

is
not
of

man
nature
is

corruptible
and
incorruptible
he
has
therefore
two
ends

on

and
the
enjoyment
of

hereafter
the
one
to
be
attained
by

the
precepts
of

the
other
by
the
theological
virtues
hence
two
guides
are
needed
the
pontiff
and
the
emperor
the
latter
of
whom
in
order
that
he
may
direct
mankind
in
accordance
with
the
teachings
of
philosophy
to
temporal
blessedness
must
preserve
universal
peace
in
the
world
thus
are
the
two
powers
equally
ordained
of
god
and
the
emperor
though
supreme
in
all
that
pertains
to
the
secular
world
is
in
some
things
dependent
on
the
pontiff
since
earthly
happiness
is
subordinate
to

cæsar
therefore
shew
towards
peter
the
reverence
wherewith
a
firstborn
son
honours
his
father
that
being
illumined
by
the
light
of
his

he
may
the

forth

no

no

that
the

of

is
the
legitimate
continuation
of
that
which

by

for

the

quoted
by

it
was
keenly
debated
while
charles
v
and
francis
i
of
france
were
rival
candidates
whether
any
one
but
a
german
was
eligible
by
birth
charles
was
either
a
spaniard
or
a
fleming
but
this
difficulty
his
partisans
avoided
by
holding
that
he
had
been
according
to
the
civil
law
of
maximilian
his
grandfather
however
to
say
nothing
of
the
guidos
and
berengars
of
earlier
days
the
examples
of
richard
and
alfonso
are
conclusive
as
to
the
eligibility
of
others
than
germans
edward
iii
of
england
was
as
has
been
said
actually
elected
henry
viii
was
a
candidate
and
attempts
were
frequently
made
to
elect
the
kings
of
france
the
mediæval
practice
seems
to
have
been
that
which
still
prevails
in
the
roman
catholic
church
to
presume
the
doctrinal
orthodoxy
and
external
conformity
of
every
citizen
whether
lay
or
clerical
until
the
contrary
be
proved
of
course
when
heresy
was
rife
it
went
hard
with
suspected
men
unless
they
could
either
clear
themselves
or
submit
to
recant
but
no
one
was
required
to
pledge
himself
beforehand
as
a
qualification
for
any
office
to
certain
doctrines
and
thus
important
as
an
emperor
orthodoxy
was
he
does
not
appear
to
have
been
subjected
to
any
test
although
the
pope
pretended
to
the
right
of
catechizing
him
in
the
faith
and
rejecting
him
if
unsound
in
the
we
find
a
long
series
of
questions
which
the
pontiff
was
to
administer
but
it
does
not
appear
and
is
in
the
highest
degree
unlikely
that
such
a
programme
was
ever
carried
out
the
charge
of
heresy
was
one
of
the

says
sozomen
in

ninth
book
of
his
ecclesiastical
history
when
alaric
was
hastening
against
rome
a
holy
monk
of
italy
admonished
him
to
spare
the
city
and
not
to
make
himself
the
cause
of
such
fearful
ills
but
alaric
answered
it
is
not
of
my
own
will
that
i
do
this
there
is
one
who
forces
me
on
and
will
not
let
me
rest
bidding
me
spoil
rome
towards
the
close
of
the
tenth
century
the
bohemian
woitech
famous
in
after
legend
as
adalbert
forsook
his
bishopric
of
prague
to
journey
into
italy
and
settled
himself
in
the
roman
monastery
of
sant
alessio
after
some
few
years
passed
there
in
religious
solitude
he
was
summoned
back
to
resume
the
duties
of
his
see
and
laboured
for
awhile
among
his
countrymen
soon
however
the
old
longing
came
over
him
he
resought
his
cell
upon
the
brow
of
the
aventine
and
there
wandering
among
the
ancient
shrines
and
taking
on
himself
the
menial
offices
of
the
convent
he
abode
happily
for
a
space
at
length
the
reproaches
of
his
metropolitan
the
archbishop
of
mentz
and
the
express
commands
of

gregory

drove
him
back
over

and
the

it
was
the

irresistible
impulse
that
drew
the
warrior
the
monk
and
the
scholar
towards
the
mystical
city
which
was
to
mediæval
europe
more
than
delphi
had
been
to
the
greek
or
mecca
to
the
islamite
the
jerusalem

the
city
which

there
was
then
as
there
is
now
something
in
rome
to
attract
men
of
every
class
the
devout
pilgrim
came
to
pray
at
the
shrine
of
the
prince
of

happy

he
could
carry

by
the
bleak
atlantic
shore
the
bone
of

the
shattered
columns
of
the
forum
the
germanic
kings
in
spite
of
pestilence
treachery
and
seditions
came
with
their
hosts
to
seek
in
the
ancient
capital
of
the
world
the
fountain
of
temporal
dominion
nor
has
the
spell
yet
wholly
lost
its
power
to
half
the
christian
nations
rome
is
the
metropolis
of
religion
to
all
the
metropolis
of

in
her
streets
and
hers
alone
among
the
cities
of
the
world
may
every
form
of
human
speech
be
heard
she
is
more
glorious
in
her
decay
and
desolation
than
the
stateliest
seats
of
modern
power
but
while
men
thought
thus
of
rome
what
was
rome
herself
the
modern
traveller
after
his
first
few
days
in
rome
when
he
has
looked
out
upon
the
campagna
from
the
summit
of
peter
paced
the
chilly
corridors
of
the
vatican
and
mused
under
the
echoing
dome
of
the
pantheon
when
he
has
passed
in
review
the
monuments
of
regal
and
republican
and
papal
rome
begins
to
seek
for
some
relics
of
the
twelve
hundred
years
that
lie
between
constantine
and
pope
julius
the
second
he
asks
the
rome
of
the
middle
ages
the
rome
of
alberic
and
hildebrand
and
rienzi
the
rome
which
dug
the
graves
of
so
many
teutonic
hosts
whither
the
pilgrims
flocked
whence
came
the
commands
at
which
kings
bowed
where
are
the
memorials
of
the
brightest
age
of
christian
architecture
the
age
which
reared
cologne
and
rheims
and
westminster
which
gave
to
italy
the
cathedrals
of
tuscany
and
the
palaces
of
venice
to
this
question
there
is
no
answer
rome
the
mother
of
the
arts
has
scarcely
a
building
to
commemorate
those
times
for
to
her
they
were
times
of
turmoil
and
misery
times
in
which
the
shame
of
the
present
was
embittered
by
recollections
of
a
brighter
past
nevertheless
a
minute
scrutiny
may
still
discover
hidden
in
dark
corners
or
disguised
under
an
unbecoming
modern
dress
much
that
carries
us
back
to
the
mediæval
town
and
helps
us
to
realize
its
social
and
political
condition
therefore
a
brief
notice
of
the
state
of
rome
during
the
middle
ages
with
especial
reference
to
those
monuments
which
the
visitor
may
still
examine
for
himself
may
not
be
without
its
use
and
is
at
any
rate
no
unfitting
pendant
to
an
account
of
the
institution
which
drew
from
the
city
its
name
and
its
magnificent
pretensions
moreover
as
will
appear
more
fully
in
the
sequel
the
history
of
the
roman
people
is
an
instructive
illustration
of
the
influence
of
those
ideas
upon
which
the
empire
itself

from

morally

there
was
no

no

have
not
unnaturally
discovered
a
miracle

after
sinking

low
the
papacy
should
ever
have
risen
again
its
rescue

now
watched
with
alarm
the
rapid
extension

its
influence
the

gave
these
feelings
a
definite
direction
it
was
the
time
of
the

hildebrand
and
his
disciples
had
been
striving
to
draw
all
the
things
of
this
world
as
well
as
of
the
next
into
their
grasp
it
was
the
era
of
the
revived
study
of
roman
law
by
which
alone
the
extravagant
pretensions
of
the
decretalists
could
be
resisted
the

were
stirring
the
minds

arnold
of

came
preaching
reform
denouncing
the
corrupt
life
of
the

not
perhaps
like
some
others
of
the
schismatics
of
his
time
denying
the
need
of
a
sacerdotal
order
but
at
any
rate
urging
its
restriction
to

spiritual
duties

treat
the
german

as
their
nominees
and
dependants
to
have
successfully
imitated
the
republican
constitution
of
the
cities
of
northern
italy
would
have
been
much
but
with
this
they
were
not
content
knowing
in
a
vague
ignorant
way
that
there
had
been
a
roman
republic
before
there
was
a
roman
empire
they
fed
their
vanity
with
visions
of
a
renewal
of
all
their
ancient
forms
and
saw
in
fancy
their
senate
and
people
sitting
again
upon
the
seven
hills
and
ruling
over
the
kings
of
the
earth
stepping
as
it
were
into
the
arena
where
pope
and
emperor
were
contending
for
the
headship
of
the
world
they
rejected
the
one
as
a
priest
and
declaring
the
other
to
be
only
their
creature
they
claimed
as
theirs
the
true
and
lawful
inheritance
of
the
which
their
ancestors
had
won
antiquity
was
in
one
sense
on
their
side
and
to
us
now
it
seems
less
strange
that
the
roman
people
should
aspire
to
rule
the
earth
than
that
a
german
barbarian
should
rule
it
in
their
name
but
practically
the
scheme
was
absurd
and
could
not
maintain
itself
against
any
serious
opposition
as
a
modern
historian
aptly
expresses
it
were
setting
up
ruins
they
might
as
well
have
raised
the
broken
columns
that
strewed
their
forum
and
hoped
to
rear
out
of
them
a
strong
and
stately
temple
the
reverence
which
the
men
of
the
middle
ages
felt
for
rome
was
given
altogether
to
the
name
and
to
the
place
nowise
to
the
people
as
for
power
they
had
none
so
far
from
holding
italy
in
subjection
they
could
scarcely
maintain
themselves
against
the
hostility
of
tusculum
but
it
would
have
been
well
worth
the
while
of
the
teutonic
emperors
to
have
made
the
romans
their
allies
and
bridled
by
their
help
the
temporal
ambition
of
the
popes
the
offer
was
actually
made
to
them
first
to
conrad
the
third
who
seems
to
have
taken
no
notice
of
it
and
afterwards
as
has
been
already
stated
to
frederick
the
first
who
repelled
in
the
most
contumelious
fashion
the
envoys
of
the
senate
hating
and
fearing
the
pope
he
always
respected
him
towards
the
romans
he
felt
all
the
contempt
of
a
feudal
king
for
burghers
and
of
a
german
warrior
for
italians
at
the
demand
of
pope
hadrian
whose
foresight
thought
no
heresy
so
dangerous
as
one
which
threatened
the
authority
of
the

arnold
of
brescia
was
seized
by
the
imperial
prefect
put
to
death
and
his
ashes
cast
into
the
tiber
lest
the
people
should
treasure
them
up
as
relics
but
the
martyrdom
of
their
leader
did
not
quench
the
hopes
of
his
followers
the
republican
constitution
continued
to
exist
and
rose
from
time
to
time
during
the
weakness
or
the
absence
of
the

a
brief
and
fitful
activity

awakened

of
the
tribune
rienzi
the
career
of
this
singular
personage
is
misunderstood
by
those
who
suppose
him
to
have
been
possessed
of
profound
political
insight
a
republican
on
modern
principles
he
was
indeed
despite
his
overweening
conceit
and
what
seems
to
us
his
charlatanry
both
a
patriot
and
a
man
of
genius
in
temperament
a
poet
filled
with
soaring
ideas
but
those
ideas
although
dressed
out
in
gaudier
colours
by
his
lively
fancy
were
after
all
only
the
old
ones
memories
of
the
glories
of
the
heathen
republic
and
a
series
of
scornful
contrasts
levelled
at
her
present
oppressors
both
of
them
shewing
no
vista
of
future
peace
except
through
the
revival
of
those
ancient
names
to
which
there
were
no
things
to
correspond
it
was
by
declaiming
on
old
texts
and
displaying
old
monuments
that
the
tribune
enlisted
the
support
of
the
roman
populace
not
by
any
appeal
to
democratic
principles
and
the
whole
of
his
acts
and
plans
though
they
astonished
men
by
their
boldness
do
not
seem
to
have
been
regarded
as
novel
or
impracticable
in
the
breasts
of
men
like
petrarch
who
loved
rome
even
more
than
they
hated
her
people
the
enthusiasm
of
rienzi
found
a
sympathetic
echo
others
scorned
and
denounced
him
as
an
upstart
a
demagogue
and
a
rebel
both
friends
and
enemies
seem
to
have
comprehended
and
regarded
as
natural
his
feelings

designs
which
were
altogether
those
of

however
a

however
illusive
around
which
the
love
and

for

once
clung

been

to
all

worse
than

the

it
remains
only
to
speak
of
the
person
who
should
have
been
to
rome
what
the
national
king
was
to
the
cities
of
france
or
england
or
germany
that
is
to
say
of
the
emperor
as
has
been
said
already
his
power
was
a
mere
chimera
chiefly
important
as
furnishing
a
pretext
to
the
colonna
and
other
ghibeline
chieftains
for
their
opposition
to
the
papal
party
even
his
abstract
rights
were
matter
of
controversy
the
popes
whose
predecessors
had
been
content
to
govern
as
the
lieutenants
of
charles
and
otto
now
maintained
that
rome
as
a
spiritual
city
could
not
be
subject
to
any
temporal
jurisdiction
and
that
she
was
therefore
no
part
of
the
roman
empire
though
at
the
same
time
its
capital
not
only
it
was
urged
had
constantine
yielded
up
rome
to
sylvester
and
his
successors
lothar
the
saxon
had
at
his
coronation
formally
renounced
his
sovereignty
by
doing
homage
to
the
pontiff
and
receiving
the
crown
as
his
vassal
the
popes
felt
then
as
they
feel
now
that
their
dignity
and
influence
would
suffer
if
they
should
even
appear
to
admit
in
their
place
of
residence
the
jurisdiction
of
a
civil
potentate
and
although
they
could
not
secure
their
own
authority
they
were
at
least
able
to
exclude
any
other
hence
it
was
that
they
were
so
uneasy
whenever
an
emperor
came
to
them
to
be
crowned
that
they
raised
up
difficulties
in
his
path
and
endeavoured
to
be
rid
of
him
as
soon
as
possible
and
here
something
must
be
said
of
the
programme
as
one
may
call
it
of
these
imperial
visits
to
rome
and
of
the
marks
of
their
presence
which
the
germans
left
behind
them
remembering
always
that
after
the
time
of
frederick
the
second
it
was
rather
the
exception
than
the
rule
for
an
emperor
to
be
crowned

than
that
of

transalpine

as

the

always
needed
money

and
in
times
when
disorder

corruption
were
at
their
height
the
work
of
building
stopped
altogether
thus
it
was
that
after
the

scarcely
a

was
erected

the

of
the
twelfth

it
befel
that

were
passing
by
successive
steps
from
the

roman

style
it
approached
rome

and
departed
from
her

upon

the

is
a
very
old
one
at

it
is
supposed
to
be
an
abbreviation
of

we
hear
in
the
eleventh

of
a
certain
cencius
who
on
one
occasion
made

thus
in
the

the
parts

are

once

genseric
was
not
a
heathen
but
he
was
a
furious
arian
which
as
far
as
respect
to
the

of
the
orthodox
went
was
nearly
the
same
thing
he
is
supposed
to
have
carried
off
the
candlestick
and
other
vessels
of
the
temple
which
titus
had
brought
from
jerusalem
to
rome
we
are
told
that
one
cause
of
the
ferocity
of
the
german
part
of
the
army
of
charles
was
their
anger
at
the
ruinous
condition
of
the
imperial
palace
under
the
influence
partly
of
this
spirit
partly
of
his
own
restless
vanity
partly
of
a
passion
to
be
doing
something
pope
sixtus
the
fifth
did
a
great
deal
of
mischief
in
the
way
of
destroying
or
spoiling
the
monuments
of
antiquity
these
campaniles
are
generally
supposed
to
date
from
the
ninth
and
tenth
centuries
i
am
informed
however
by
parker
of
oxford
whose
antiquarian
skill
is
well
known
that
he
is
led
to
believe
by
an
examination
of
their
mouldings
that
few
or
none
unless
it
be
that
of
san
prassede
are
older
than
the
twelfth
century
this
of
course
applies
only
to
the
existing
buildings
the
type
of
tower
may
be
and
indeed
no
doubt
is
older
somewhat
similar
towers
may
be
observed
in
many
parts
of
the
italian
alps
especially
in
the
wonderful
mountain
land
north
of
venice
where
such
towers
are
of
all
dates
from
the
eleventh
or
twelfth
down
to
the
nineteenth
century
the
ancient
type
having
in
these
remote
valleys
been
adhered
to
because
the
builder
had
no
other
models
before
him
in
the
valley
of
cimolais
i
have
seen
such
a
campanile
in
course
of
erection
precisely
similar
to
others
in
the
neighbouring
villages
some
eight
centuries
old
the
very
curious
round
towers
of
ravenna
some
four
or
five
of
which
are
still
standing
seem
to
have
originally
had
similar
windows
though
these
have
been
all
or
nearly
all
stopped
up
the
roman
towers
are
all
square
the
palatine
hill
seems
to
have
been
then
as
it
is
for
the
most
part
now
a
waste
of
stupendous
ruins
in
the
great
imperial
palace
upon
its
northern
and
eastern
sides
was
the
residence
of
an
official
of
the
eastern
court
in
the
beginning
of
the
eighth
century
in
the
time
of
charles
some
seventy
years
later
this
palace
was
no
longer
habitable
such
as
we
see
it
in
the
later
and
lesser
churches
of
basilica
form
it
was
thus
that
most
of
the
earlier
teutonic
emperors
and
notably
charles
and
otto
professed
to
have
obtained
the
crown
although
practically
it
was
partly
a
matter
of
conquest
and
partly
of
private
arrangement
with
the
pope
in
later
times
the
seven
germanic
princes
were
recognized
as
the
legally
qualified
electoral
body
but
their
appearance
on
the
stage
was
a
result
of
the
confusion
of
the
german
kingdom
with
the
roman
empire
and
in
strictness
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
roman
crown
at
all
the
right
to
bestow
it
could
only
on
principle
belong
to
some
roman
authority
and
those
who
felt
the
difficulty
were
driven
to
suppose
a
formal
cession
of
their
privilege
by
the
roman
people
to
the
seven
electors

functions
of
his

the
precedents
of

especially
of

had
established
the
principle
that
it

even
more
properly
than
to
the
pope
to
convoke
ecclesiastical
assemblies
from

the
tenet
commended
itself
to
the
reforming
party
in
the

headed
by
gerson
the
chancellor
of
paris
whose
aim
it
was
while
making
no
changes
in
matters
of
faith
to
correct
the
abuses
which
had
grown
up
in
discipline
and
government
and
limit
the
power
of
the
popes
by
exalting
the
authority
of
general

to
whom
there
was
now
attributed
an
immunity
from
error
superior
even
to
that
which
resided
in
the

although
it
was
only
the
sacerdotal
body
not
the
whole
christian
people
who
were
thus
made
the
exponents
of
the
universal
religious
consciousness
the
doctrine
was
nevertheless
a
foreshadowing
of
that
fuller
freedom
which
was
soon
to
follow
the
existence
of
the
holy
empire
and
the
existence
of
general
councils
were
as
has
been
already
remarked
necessary
parts
of
one
and
the
same
theory
and
it
was
therefore
more
than
a
coincidence
that
the
last
occasion
on
which
the
whole
of
latin
christendom
met
to
deliberate
and
act
as
a
single
commonwealth
was
also
the
last
on
which
that
lawful
temporal
head
appeared
in
the

of
his

it
might

whether
he

when
in
the
calamitous
reign
of
frederick
the
third
ended
it
was
impossible
for
the
princes
to
see
with
unconcern
the
condition
into
which
their
selfishness
and
turbulence
had
brought
the
empire
the
time
was
indeed
critical
hitherto
the
germans
had
been
protected
rather
by
the
weakness
of
their
enemies
than
by
their
own
strength
from
france
there
had
been
little
to
fear

the

menaced

side

from

still
less
while
she
was
torn
by
the
strife
of

and

now
throughout
western
europe
the
power
of
the
feudal
oligarchies
was
broken
and
its
chief
countries
were
being
by
the
establishment
of
fixed
rules
of
succession
and
the
absorption
of
the
smaller
into
the
larger
principalities
rapidly
built
up
into
compact
and

spain
became
a

state
by

and

in

there

thus
france
enlarged

to

to
which
this

that
cause
is
to
be
found
in
the

which
regarded
the

as
an
international

among
christian
states
from
the
day
when
otto
the
great
was
crowned
at
rome
the
characters
of
german
king
and
roman
emperor
were
united
in
one
person
and
it
has
been
shewn
how
that
union
tended
more
and
more
to
become
a
fusion
if
the
two
offices
in
their
nature
and
origin
so
dissimilar
had
been
held
by
different
persons
the
roman
empire
would
most
probably
have
soon
disappeared
while
the
german
kingdom
grew
into
a
robust
national
monarchy
their
connection
gave
a
longer
life
to
the
one
and
a
feebler
life
to
the
other
while
at
the
same
time
it
transformed
both
so
long
as
germany
was
only
one
of
the
many
countries
that
bowed
beneath
their
sceptre
it
was
possible
for
the
emperors
though
we
need
not
suppose
they
troubled
themselves
with
speculations
on
the
matter
to
distinguish
their
imperial
authority
as
international
and
more
than
half
religious
from
their
royal
which
was
or
was
meant
to
be
exclusively
local
and
feudal
but
when
within
the
narrowed
bounds
of
germany
these
international
functions
had
ceased
to
have
any
meaning
when
the
rulers
of
england
spain
france
denmark
hungary
poland
italy
burgundy
had
in
succession
repudiated
their
control
and
the
lord
of
the
world
found
himself
obeyed
by
none
but
his
own
people
he
would
not
sink
from
being
lord
of
the
world
into
a
simple
teutonic
king
but
continued
to
play
in
the
more
contracted
theatre
the
part
which
had
belonged
to
him
in
the
wider
thus
did
germany
instead
of
europe
become
the
sphere
of
his
international
jurisdiction
and
her
electors
and
princes
originally
mere
vassals
no
greater
than
a
count
of
champagne
in
france
or
an
earl
of
chester
in
england
stepped
into
the
place
which
it
had
been
meant
that
the
several
monarchs
of
christendom
should
fill
if
the
power
of
their
head
had
been
what
it
was
in
the
eleventh
century
the
additional
dignity
so
assigned
to
them
might
have
signified
very
little
but
coming
in
to
confirm
and
justify
the
liberties
already
won
this
theory
of
their
relation
to
the
sovereign
had
a
great
though
at
the
time
scarcely
perceptible
influence
in
changing
the
german
empire
as
we
may
now
begin
to
call
it
from
a
state
into
a
sort
of
confederation
or
body
of
states
united
indeed
for
some
of
the
purposes
of
government
but
separate
and
independent
for
others
more
important
thus
and
that
in
its
ecclesiastical
as
well
as
its
civil
organization
germany
became
a
miniature
of
christendom
the
pope
though
he
retained
the
wider
sway
which
his
rival
had
lost
was
in
an
especial
manner
the
head
of
the
german
clergy
as
the
emperor
was
of
the
laity
the
three
rhenish
prelates
sat
in
the
supreme
college
beside
the
four
temporal
electors
the
nobility
of
and
abbots
was
as
essential
a
part
of
the
constitution
and
as
influential
in
the
deliberations
of
the
diet
as
were
the
dukes
counts
and
margraves
of
the
empire
the
christian
state
was
to
have
been
governed
by
a
hierarchy
of
spiritual
pastors
whose
graduated
ranks
of
authority
should
exactly
correspond
with
those
of
the
temporal
magistracy
who
were
to
be
like
them
endowed
with
worldly
wealth
and
power
and
to
enjoy
a
jurisdiction
although
distinct
this
system
which
it
was
in
vain
attempted
to
establish
in
europe
during
the
eleventh
and
twelfth
centuries
was
in
its
main
features
that
which
prevailed
in
the
germanic
empire
from
the
fourteenth
century
onwards
and
conformably
to
the
analogy
which
may
be
traced
between
the
position
of
the
archdukes
of
austria
in
germany
and
the
place
which
the
four
saxon
and
the
two
first
franconian
emperors
had
held
in
europe
both
being
recognized
as
leaders
and
presidents
in
all
that
concerned
the
common
interest
in
the
one
case
of
the
christian
in
the
other
of
the
whole
german
people
while
neither
of
them
had
any
power
of
direct
government
in
the
territories
of
local
kings
and
lords
so
the
plan
by
which
those
who
chose
maximilian
emperor
sought
to
strengthen
their
national
monarchy
was
in
substance
that
which
the
popes
had
followed
when
they
conferred
the
crown
of
the
world
on
charles
and
otto
the
pontiffs
then
like
the
electors
now
finding
that
they
could
not
give
with
the
title
the
power
which
its
functions
demanded
were
driven
to
the
expedient
of
selecting
for
the
office
persons
whose
private
resources
enabled
them
to
sustain
it
with
dignity
the
first
frankish
and
the
first
saxon
emperors
were
chosen
because
they
were
already
the
mightiest
potentates
in
europe
maximilian
because
he
was
the
strongest
of
the
german
princes
the
parallel
may
be
carried
one
step
further
just
as
under
otto
and
his
successors
the
roman
empire
was
teutonized
so
now
under
the
hapsburg
dynasty
from
whose
hands
the
sceptre
departed
only

so
many

was
growing
obsolete
and
the
theory

had
wrought
such

on

passed
ere
long
so
completely
from

by
restoring
to
maximilian
the
authority
his

had
once
enjoyed
but
by
setting
up
a
body
which
would
resemble

more

the

the

took

was
therefore
of
at

questionable
validity
each
assumed
after

coronation
the
title
of

employed
this
in
all
documents
issued
in

the

omitted
when

partly
from

of

partly
because
the

regarding

were
forgotten

only
by
antiquaries
he
was
never
called
even
when
formality
was

anything
but
emperor
the
substantial
import
of
another

now
first
introduced
is
the

before

the

the
teutonic

had
called
himself
either
alone

orientalium

had

adding

it
has
been
thought
that
from
a
mixture
of
the
title
king
of
germany
and
that
of
emperor
has
been
formed
the
phrase
emperor
or
less
correctly
of
germany
but
more
probably
the
terms
emperor
and
of
germany
are
nothing
but
convenient
corruptions
of
the
technical
description
of
the
germanic
sovereign
that
the
empire
was
thus
sinking
into
a
merely
german
power
can
not
be
doubted
but
it
was
only
natural
that
those
who
lived
at
the
time
should
not
discern
the
tendency
of
events
again
and
again
did
the
restless
and
sanguine
maximilian
propose
the
recovery
of
burgundy
and
italy
his
last
scheme
was
to
adjust
the
relations
of
papacy
and

by
becoming

were

set

beyond

there
was
a

there
is
perhaps
no

in

great
a

it

a
renewal

primitive

all
these
indeed
to
some
extent
it
was
but
it
was
also
something
more
profound
and
fraught
with
mightier
consequences
than
any
of
them
it
was
in
its
essence
the
assertion
of
the
principle
of
individuality
that
is
to
say
of
true
spiritual
freedom
hitherto
the
personal
consciousness
had
been
a
faint
and
broken
reflection
of
the
universal
obedience
had
been
held
the
first
of
religious
duties
truth
had
been
conceived
as
a
something
external
and
positive
which
the
priesthood
who
were
its
stewards
were
to
communicate
to
the
passive
layman
and
whose
saving
virtue
lay
not
in
its
being
felt
and
known
by
him
to
be
truth
but
in
a
purely
formal
and
unreasoning
acceptance
the
great
principles
which
mediæval
christianity
still
cherished
were
obscured
by
the
limited
rigid
almost
sensuous
forms
which
had
been
forced
on
them
in
times
of
ignorance
and
barbarism
that
which
was
in
its
nature
abstract
had
been
able
to
survive
only
by
taking
a
concrete
expression
the
universal
consciousness
became
the
visible
church
the
visible
church
hardened
into
a
government
and
degenerated
into
a
hierarchy
holiness
of
heart
and
life
was
sought
by
outward
works
by
penances
and
pilgrimages
by
gifts
to
the
poor
and
to
the
clergy
wherein
there
dwelt
often
little
enough
of
a
charitable
mind
the
presence
of
divine
truth
among
men
was
symbolized
under
one
aspect
by
the
existence
on
earth
of
an
infallible
vicar
of
god
the
pope
under
another
by
the
reception
of
the
present
deity
in
the
sacrifice
of
the
mass
in
a
third
by
the
doctrine
that
the
priest
power
to
remit
sins
and
administer
the
sacraments
depended
upon
a
transmission
of
miraculous
gifts
which
can
hardly
be
called

than
physical

of
doctrine
which
might
but
for
the
position
of
the
church
as
a
worldly
and
therefore

power
have
expanded
renewed
and
purified
itself
during
the
four
centuries
that
had
elapsed
since
its
completion
and
thus
remained
in
harmony
with
the
growing
intelligence
of
mankind
was
suddenly
rent
in
pieces
by
the
convulsion
of
the
reformation
and
flung
away
by
the
more
religious
and
more
progressive
peoples
of
europe
that
which
was
external
and
concrete
was
in
all
things
to
be
superseded
by
that
which
was
inward
and
spiritual
it
was
proclaimed
that
the
individual
spirit
while
it
continued
to
mirror
itself
in
the
had
nevertheless
an
independent
existence
as
a
centre
of
force
and
was
to
be
in
all
things
active
rather
than
passive
truth
was
no
longer
to
be
truth
to
the
soul
until
it
should
have
been
by
the
soul
recognized
and
in
some
measure
even
created
but
when
so
recognized
and
felt
it
is
able
under
the
form
of
faith
to
transcend
outward
works
and
to
transform
the
dogmas
of
the
understanding
it
becomes
the
living
principle
within
each
man
breast
infinite
itself
and
expressing
itself
infinitely
through
his
thoughts
and
acts
he
who
as
a
spiritual
being
was
delivered
from
the
priest
and
brought
into
direct
relation
with
the
divinity
needed
not
as
heretofore
to
be
enrolled
a
member
of
a
visible
congregation
of
his
fellows
that
he
might
live
a
pure
and
useful
life
among
them
thus
by
the
reformation
the
visible
church
as
well
as
the
priesthood
lost
that
paramount
importance
which
had
hitherto
belonged
to
it
and
sank
from
being
the
depositary
of
all
religious
tradition
the
source
and
centre
of
religious
life
the
arbiter
of
eternal
happiness
or
misery
into
a
mere
association
of
christian
men
for
the
expression
of
mutual
sympathy
and
the
better
attainment
of
certain
common
ends
like
those
other
doctrines
which
were
now
assailed
by
the
reformation
this
mediæval
view
of
the
nature
of
the
visible
church
had
been
naturally
and
so
it
may
be
said
necessarily
developed
between
the
third
and
the
twelfth
century
and
must
therefore
have
represented
the
thoughts
and
satisfied
the
wants
of
those
times
by
the
visible
church
the
flickering
lamp
of
knowledge
and
literary
culture
as
well
as
of
religion
had
been
fed
and
tended
through
the
long
night
of
the
dark
ages
but
like
the
whole
theological
fabric
of
which
it
formed
a
part
it
was
now
hard
and
unfruitful
identified
with
its
own
worst
abuses
capable
apparently
of
no
further
development
and
unable
to
satisfy
minds
which
in
growing
stronger
had
grown
more
conscious
of
their
strength
before
the
awakened
zeal
of
the
northern
nations
it
stood
a
cold
and
lifeless
system
whose
organization
as
a
hierarchy
checked
the
free
activity
of
thought
whose
bestowal
of
worldly
power
and
wealth
on
spiritual
pastors
drew
them
away
from
their
proper
duties
and
which
by
maintaining
alongside
of
the
civil
magistracy
a
and
rival
government
maintained
also
that
separation
of
the
spiritual
element
in
man
from
the
secular
which
had
been
so
complete
and
so
pernicious
during
the
middle

severs

morality

be
said

we
have
here
to
consider
the
distinction
is
only
apparent
the
holy
empire
is
but
another
name
for
the
visible
church
it
has
been
shewn
already
how
mediæval
theory
constructed
the
state
on
the
model
of
the
church
how
the
roman
empire
was
the
shadow
of
the
popedom
designed
to
rule
men
bodies
as
the
pontiff
ruled
their
souls
both
alike
claimed
obedience
on
the
ground
that
truth
is
one
and
that
where
there
is
one
faith
there
must
be
one
government
and
therefore
since
it
was
this
very
principle
of
formal
unity
that
the
reformation
overthrew
it
became
a
revolt
against
despotism
of
every
kind
it
erected
the
standard
of
civil
as
well
as
of
religious
liberty
since
both
of
them
are
needed
though
needed
in
a
different
measure
for
the
worthy
development
of
the
individual
spirit
the
empire
had
never
been
conspicuously
the
antagonist
of
popular
freedom
and
was
even
under
charles
the
fifth
far
less
formidable
to
the
commonalty
than
were
the
petty
princes
of
germany
but
submission
and
submission
on
the

of
indefeasible
transmitted
right
upon
the
ground

of
the

to
suffer
heresy
and
schism
as
little
as
the
parallel
sins
of
treason
and
rebellion
had
been
its
constant
claim
and
watchword
since
the
days
of
julius
cæsar
it
had
passed
through
many
phases
but
in
none
of
them
had
it
ever
been
a
constitutional
monarchy
pledged
to
the
recognition
of
popular
rights
and
hence
the
indirect
tendency
of
the
reformation
to
narrow
the
province
of
government
and
exalt
the
privileges
of
the
subject
was
as
plainly
adverse
to
the
empire
as
the
protestant
claim
of
the
right
of
private
judgment
was
to
the
pretensions
of
the

the
remark
must
not
be
omitted
in
passing
how
much
less
than
might
have
been
expected
the
religious
movement
did
at
first
actually
effect
in
the
way
of
promoting
either
political
progress
or
freedom
of
conscience
the
habits
of
centuries
were
not
to
be
unlearnt
in
a
few
years
and
it
was
natural
that
ideas
struggling
into
existence
and
activity
should
work
erringly
and
imperfectly
for
a
time
by
a
few
inflammable
minds
liberty
was
carried
into
antinomianism
and
produced
the
wildest
excesses
of
life
and
doctrine
several
fantastic
sects
arose
refusing
to
conform
to
the
ordinary
rules
without
which
human
society
could
not
subsist
but
these
commotions
neither
spread
widely
nor
lasted
long
far
more
pervading
and
more
remarkable
was
the
other
error
if
that
can
be
called
an
error
which
was
the
almost
unavoidable
result
of
the
circumstances
of
the
time
the
principles
which
had
led
the
protestants
to
sever
themselves
from
the
roman
church
should
have
taught
them
to
bear
with
the
opinions
of
others
and
warned
them
from
the
attempt
to
connect
agreement
in
doctrine
or
manner
of
worship
with
the
necessary
forms
of
civil
government
still
less
ought
they
to
have
enforced
that
agreement
by
civil
penalties
for
faith
upon
their
own
shewing
had
no
value
save
when
it
was
freely
given
a
church
which
does
not
claim
to
be
infallible
is
bound
to
allow
that
some
part
of
the
truth
may
possibly
be
with
its
adversaries
a
church
which
permits
or
encourages
human
reason
to
apply
itself
to
revelation
has
no
right
first
to
argue
with
people
and
then
to
punish
them
if
they
are
not
convinced
but
whether
it
was
that
men
only
half
saw
what
they
had
done
or
that
finding
it
hard
enough
to
unrivet
priestly
fetters
they
welcomed
all
the
aid
a
temporal
prince
could
give
the
result
was
that
religion
or
rather
religious
creeds
began
to
be
involved
with
politics
more
closely
than
had
ever
been
the
case
before
through
the
greater
part
of
christendom
wars
of
religion
raged
for
a
century
or
more
and
down
to
our
own
days
feelings
of
theological
antipathy
continue
to
affect
the
relations
of
the
powers
of
europe
in
almost
every
country
the
form
of
doctrine
which
triumphed
associated
itself
with
the
state
and
maintained
the
despotic
system
of
the
middle
ages
while
it
forsook
the
grounds
on
which
that
system
had
been
based
it
was
thus
that
there
arose
national
churches
which
were
to
be
to
the
several
countries
of
europe
that
which
the
church
catholic
had
been
to
the
world
at
large
churches
that
is
to
say
each
of
which
was
to
be
with
its
respective
state
was
to
enjoy
landed
wealth
and
exclusive
political
privilege
and
was
to
be
armed
with
coercive
powers
against
recusants
it
was
not
altogether
easy
to
find
a
set
of
theoretical
principles
on
which
such
churches
might
be
made
to
rest
for
they
could
not
like
the
old
church
point
to
the
historical
transmission
of
their
doctrines
they
could
not
claim
to
have
in
any
one
man
or
body
of
men
an
infallible
organ
of
divine
truth
they
could
not
even
fall
back
upon
general
councils
or
the
argument
whatever
it
may
be
worth
iudicat
orbis
but
in
practice
these
difficulties
were
soon
got
over
for
the
dominant
party
in
each
state
if
it
was
not
infallible
was
at
any
rate
quite
sure
that
it
was
right
and
could
attribute
the
resistance
of
other
sects
to
nothing
but
moral
obliquity
the
will
of
the
sovereign
as
in
england
or
the
will
of
the
majority
as
in
holland
scandinavia
and
scotland
imposed
upon
each
country
a
peculiar
form
of
worship
and
kept
up
the
practices
of
mediæval
intolerance
without
their
justification
persecution
which
might
be
at
least
excused
in
an
infallible
catholic
and
apostolic
church
was
peculiarly
odious
when
practised
by
those
who
were
not
catholic
who
were
no
more
apostolic
than
their
neighbours
and
who
had
just
revolted
from
the
most
ancient
and
venerable
authority
in
the
name
of
rights
which
they
now
denied
to
others
if
union
with
the
visible
church
by
participation
in
a
material
sacrament
be
necessary
to
eternal
life
persecution
may
be
held
a
duty
a
kindness
to
perishing
souls
but
if
the
kingdom
of
heaven
be
in
every
sense
a
kingdom
of
the
spirit
if
saving
faith
be
possible
out
of
one
visible
body
and
under
a
diversity
of
external
forms
persecution
becomes
at
once
a
crime
and
a
folly
therefore
the
intolerance
of
protestants
if
the
forms
it
took
were
less
cruel
than
those
practised
by
the
roman
catholics
was
also
far
less
defensible
for
it
had
seldom
anything
better
to
allege
on
its
behalf
than
motives
of
political
expediency
or
more
often
the
mere
headstrong
passion
of
a
ruler
or
a
faction
to
silence
the
expressions
of
any
opinions
but
their
own
to
enlarge
upon
this
theme
did
space
permit
it
would
not
be
to
digress
from
the
proper
subject
of
this
narrative
for
the
empire
as
has
been
said
more
than
once
already
was
far
less
an
institution
than
a
theory
or
doctrine
and
hence
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
the
ideas
which
have
but
recently
ceased
to
prevail
regarding
the
duty
of
the
magistrate
to
compel
uniformity
in
doctrine
and
worship
by
the
civil
arm
may
all
be
traced
to
the
relation
which
that
doctrine
established
between
the
roman
church
and
the
roman
empire
to
the
conception
in
fact
of
an
empire
church
itself
sidenote
influence
of
the
reformation
on
the
name
and
associations
of
the
empire
two
of
the
ways
in
which
the
reformation
affected
the
empire
have
been
now
described
its
immediate
political
results
and
its
far
more
profound
doctrinal
importance
as
implanting
new
ideas
regarding
the
nature
of
freedom
and
the
province
of
government
a
third
though
apparently
almost
superficial
can
not
be
omitted
its
name
and
its
traditions
little
as
they
retained
of
their
former
magic
power
were
still
such
as
to
excite
the
antipathy
of
the
german
reformers
the
form
which
the
doctrine
of
the
supreme
importance
of
one
faith
and
one
body
of
the
faithful
had
taken
was
the
dominion
of
the
ancient
capital
of
the
world
through
her
spiritual
head
the
roman
bishop
and
her
temporal
head
the
emperor
as
the
names
of
roman
and
christian
had
been
once
convertible
so
long
afterwards
were
those
of
roman
and
catholic
the
reformation
separating
into
its
parts
what
had
hitherto
been
one
conception
attacked
romanism
but
not
catholicity
and
formed
religious
communities
which
while
continuing
to
call
themselves
christian
repudiated
the
form
with
which
christianity
had
been
so
long
identified
in
the
west
as
the
empire
was
founded
upon
the
assumption
that
the
limits
of
church
and
state
are
exactly
a
change
which
withdrew
half
of
its
subjects
from
the
one
body
while
they
remained
members
of
the
other
transformed
it
utterly
destroyed
the
meaning
and
value
of
its
old
arrangements
and
forced
the
emperor
into
a
strange
and
incongruous
position
to
his
protestant
subjects
he
was
merely
the
head
of
the
administration
to
the
catholics
he
was
also
the
defender
and
advocate
of
their
church
thus
from
being
chief
of
the
whole
state
he
became
the
chief
of
a
party
within
it
the
corpus
catholicorum
as
opposed
to
the
corpus
evangelicorum
he
lost
what
had
been
hitherto
his
most
holy
claim
to
the
obedience
of
the
subject
the
awakened
feeling
of
german
nationality
was
driven
into
hostility
to
an
institution
whose
title
and
history
bound
it
to
the
centre
of
foreign
tyranny
after
exulting
for
seven
centuries
in
the
heritage
of
roman
rule
the
teutonic
nations
cherished
again
the
feelings
with
which
their
ancestors
had
resisted
julius
cæsar
and
germanicus
two
mutually
repugnant
systems
could
not
exist
side
by
side
without
striving
to
destroy
one
another
the
instincts
of
theological
sympathy
overcame
the
duties
of
political
allegiance
and
men
who
were
subjects
both
of
the
empire
and
of
their
local
prince
gave
all
their
loyalty
to
him
who
espoused
their

protected
their

was

vengeance
that
the
issue
of

long
protracted

would
have
gone
against
them
but
for
the

of

it
was
the
leading
principle
of
richelieu
policy
to
depress
the
house
of
hapsburg
and
keep
germany
disunited
hence
he
fostered
protestantism
abroad
while
trampling
it
down
at

the
triumph

sealed
in
on

were
at

induced
to
do
so
only
by
their
overmastering
fear
of
the

all
the

seem
to
have
wanted
that
sort
of
genial
heartiness
which
apt
as
it

to
be
stifled

been

by

it

last
stage
in
the
decline
of

the
peace
of
westphalia
is
the
first
and
with
the
exception
perhaps
of
the
treaties
of
vienna
in
the
most
important
of
those
attempts
to
reconstruct
by
diplomacy
the
european
which
have
played
so
large
a
part
in
modern
history
it
is
important
however
not
as
marking
the
introduction
of
new
principles
but
as
winding
up
the
struggle
which
had
convulsed
germany
since
the
revolt
of
luther
sealing
its
results
and
closing
definitively
the
period
of
the
reformation
although
the
causes
of
disunion
which
the
religious
movement
called
into
being
had
now
been
at
work
for
more
than
a
hundred
years
their
effects
were
not
fully
seen
till
it
became
necessary
to
establish
a
system
which
should
represent
the
altered
relations
of
the
german
states
it
may
thus
be
said
of
this
famous
peace
as
of
the
other
law
of
the
empire
the
golden
bull
that
it
did
no
more
than
legalize
a
condition
of
things
already
in
existence
but
which
by
being
legalized
acquired
new
importance
to
all
parties
alike
the
result
of
the
thirty
years
war
was
thoroughly
unsatisfactory
to
the
protestants
who
had
lost
bohemia
and
still
were
obliged
to
hold
an
inferior
place
in
the
electoral
college
and
in
the
diet
to
the
catholics
who
were
forced
to
permit
the
exercise
of
heretical
worship
and
leave
the
church
lands
in
the
grasp
of
sacrilegious
spoilers
to
the
princes
who
could
not
throw
off
the
burden
of
imperial
supremacy
to
the
emperor
who
could
turn
that
supremacy
to
no
practical
account
no
other
conclusion
was
possible
to
a
contest
in
which
every
one
had
been
vanquished
and
no
one
victorious
which
had
ceased
because
while
the
reasons
for
war
continued
the
means
of
war
had
failed
nevertheless
the
substantial
advantage
remained
with
the
german
princes
for
they
gained
the
formal
recognition
of
that
territorial
independence
whose
origin
may
be
placed
as
far
back
as
the
days
of
frederick
the
second
and
the
maturity
of
which
had
been
hastened
by
the
events
of
the
last
preceding
century
it
was
indeed
not
only
recognized
but
justified
as
rightful
and
necessary
for
while
the
political
situation
to
use
a
current
phrase
had
changed
within
the
last
two
hundred
years
the
eyes
with
which
men
regarded
it
had
changed
still
more
never
by
their
fiercest
enemies
in
earlier
times
not
once
by
the
popes
or
lombard
republicans
in
the
heat
of
their
strife
with
the
franconian
and
swabian
cæsars
had
the
emperors
been
reproached
as
mere
german
kings
or
their
claim
to
be
the
lawful
heirs
of
rome
denied
the
protestant
jurists
of
the
sixteenth
or
rather
of
the
seventeenth
century
were
the
first
persons
who
ventured
to
scoff
at
the
pretended
lordship
of
the
world
and
declare
their
empire
to
be
nothing
more
than
a
german
monarchy
in
dealing
with
which
no
superstitious
reverence
need
prevent
its
subjects
from
making
the
best
terms
they
could
for
themselves

controlling

almost

from

of

the
unexpected
moral
that
the
power
of
the
former
has
been
always
dangerous
and
is
now
more
dangerous
than
ever
and
then
launches
out
into
a
long
invective
against
the
policy
of
the
hapsburgs
an
invective
which
the
ambition

harshness
of

failing
this
he
would
have
the

and
provide
means
for
resisting
or
dethroning
him
it
was
by
these
views
which
seem
to
have
made
a
profound
impression
in
germany
that
the
states
or
rather
france
and
sweden
acting
on
their

were
guided
in
the
negotiations

extorting
a
full
recognition
of
the
sovereignty
of
all
the

always

restricted

to
be

the
future

of

confined
to
the
rights
of
granting
titles
and
confirming

in
matters
of

an
exact
though
not
perfectly
reciprocal
equality
was
established
between
the
two
chief
ecclesiastical
bodies
and
the
right
of

is
to
say
of
deciding
questions
in

religion
was
involved

amicable
negotiations

catholic

by

schismatics
to
a
full
share
in
all
those
civil
rights
which
according
to
the
doctrines
of
the
early
middle
age
could
be
enjoyed
by
no
one
who
was
out
of
the
communion
of
the
catholic
church
the
peace
of
westphalia
was
therefore
an
abrogation
of
the
sovereignty
of

and
of
the
theory
of

with

the

seeing
how
at
home
they
opposed
every
scheme
of

which
could
in
the

degree
trench
upon
their
own
prerogative
how
they
strove
to
obstruct
the
imperial

lest
it
should
interfere
with
their

men
were
driven
to
separate
the

when

the

failed
to
leave

to

fate
still
the
old
line
clung
to
the

with
that
hapsburg
gripe
which
has
almost
passed
into
a
proverb
odious
as
austria
was
no
one
could
despise
her
or
fancy
it
easy
to
shake
her
commanding
position
in

fortunate
her
designs
were
steadily
pursued
her
dismembered
territories
always
returned
to
her
though
the
throne
continued
strictly
elective
it
was
impossible
not
to
be
influenced
by
long
prescription
projects
were
repeatedly
formed
to
set
the
hapsburgs
aside
by
electing
a
prince
of
some
other
line
or
by
passing
a
law
that
there
should
never
be
more
than
two
or
four
successive
emperors
of
the
same
house
france
ever
and
anon
renewed
her
warnings
to
the
electors
that
their
freedom
was
passing
from
them
and
the
sceptre
becoming
hereditary
in
one
haughty
family
but
it
was
felt
that
a
change
would
be
difficult
and
disagreeable
and
that
the
heavy
expense
and
scanty
revenues
of
the
empire
required
to
be
supported
by
larger
patrimonial
domains
than
most
german
princes
possessed
the
heads
of
states
like
prussia
and
hanover
states
whose
size
and
wealth
would
have
made
them
suitable
candidates
were
protestants
and
so
excluded
both
by
the
connexion
of
the
imperial
office
with
the
church
and
by
the
majority
of
roman
catholics
in
the
electoral
college
who
however
jealous
they
might
be
of
austria
were
led
both
by
habit
and
sympathy
to
rally
round
her
in
moments
of
peril
the
one
occasion
on
which
these
considerations
were

in

monarchies
both
were
gifted
with
a
strong
and
susceptible
imagination
which
if
it
sometimes
overbore
their
judgment
was
yet
one
of
the

carolingian

a
chief
determined
to
be

yet
unable
to
be

after
the
fashion
of
the

and
seductive
as
was
such
a
connexion
to
the

vanity
of

people
it
was
no
studied
purpose

art
that
led

fully
as

anything
that
the

destiny
which
had
made

had
also

went

ancient
capital
of
the
frankish

to
receive

the

of

that
he
talked

they
had
formed
a

of
the
carolingian

though
they
had
never

stephen

ten
centuries
before

in
the
throne
of
the
last
merovingian
the
same
desire
to
be
regarded
as
lawful
emperor
of
the
west
shewed
itself
in
his
assumption
of
the
lombard
crown
at
milan
in
the
words
of
the
decree
by
which
he
annexed
rome
to
the
empire
revoking
donations
which
my
predecessors
the
french
emperors
have
made
in
the
title
of
rome
which
he
bestowed
on
his
son
in
imitation
of
the
german
of
the
romans
we
are
even
told
that
it
was
at
one
time
his
intention
to
eject
the
hapsburgs
and
be
chosen
roman
emperor
in
their
stead
had
this
been
done
the
analogy
would
have
been
complete
between
the
position
which
the
french
ruler
held
to
austria
now
and
that
in
which
charles
and
otto
had
stood
to
the
feeble
cæsars
of
byzantium
it
was
curious
to
see
the
head
of
the
roman
church
turning
away
from
his
ancient
ally
to
the
reviving
power
of
france
france
where
the
goddess
of
reason
had
been
worshipped
eight
years
before
just
as
he
had
sought
the
help
of
the
first
carolingians
against
his
lombard
enemies
the
difference
was
indeed
great
between
the
feelings
wherewith
pius
the
seventh
addressed
his
dear
son
in
christ
and
those
that
had
pervaded
the
intercourse
of
pope
hadrian
the
first
with
the
son
of
pipin
just
as
the
contrast
is
strange
between
the
principles
that
shaped
napoleon
policy
and
the
vision
of
a
theocracy
that
had
floated
before
the
mind
of
charles
neither
comparison
is
much
to
the
advantage
of
the
modern
but
pius
might
be
pardoned
for
catching
at
any
help
in
his
distress
and
napoleon
found
that
the
protectorship
of
the
church
strengthened
his
position
in
france

gave
him
dignity

so
redistributed

that
it
could
hardly
be

to
exist
in
anything

napoleon
appears
as
the
restorer
of

the
rebuilder
of
the
shattered
edifice
of

the
author
of

code
and
an

which
the

who
dethroned
him
were
glad
to
preserve
abroad
he
was
the
true
child
of
the

conquered
only
to
destroy
it
was
his
mission
a
mission
more
beneficent
in
its
result
than
in
its
means
to
break
up
in
germany
and
italy
the
abominable
system
of
petty
states
to
reawaken
the
spirit
of
the
people
to
sweep
away
the
relics
of
an
effete
feudalism

leave
the

the

of

was
a
time
when
this

that
the

of
the
world
were
at
hand
but
in
the
whirl
of
change
that
had
bewildered
men
since
it
passed
almost
unnoticed
no
one
could
yet
fancy
how
things
would
end
or
what
sort
of
a
new
order
would
at
last
shape
itself
out
of
chaos
when
universal
monarchy
had
dissolved
and
old
landmarks
shewed
themselves
again
above
the
receding
waters
it
was
commonly
supposed
that
the
empire
would
be
on
its
former
footing
such
was
indeed
the
wish
of
many
states
and
among
them
of
hanover
representing
great
britain
though
a
simple
revival
of
the
old
empire
was
plainly
out
of
the
question
it
still
appeared
to
them
that
germany
would
be
best
off
under
the
presidency
of
a
single
head
entrusted
with
the
ancient
office
of
maintaining
peace
among
the
members
of
the
confederation
but
the
new
kingdoms
bavaria
especially
were
unwilling
to
admit
a
superior
prussia
elated
at
the
glory
she
had
won
in
the
war
of
independence
would
have
disputed
the
crown
with
austria
austria
herself
cared
little
to
resume
an
office
shorn
of
much
of
its
dignity
with
duties
to
perform
and
no
resources
to
enable
her
to
discharge
them
use
was
therefore
made
of
an
expression
in
the
peace
of
paris
which
spoke
of
uniting
germany
by
a
federative
bond
and
the
congress
of
vienna
was
decided
by
the
wishes
of
austria
to
establish
a
confederation
thus
was
brought
about
the
present
german
federal
constitution
which
is
itself
confessed
by
the
attempts
so
often
made
to
reform
it
to
be
a
mere
temporary
expedient
oppressive
in
the
hands
of
the
strong
and
useless
for
the
protection
of
the
weak
of
late
years

of
liberal
politicians

indignant
at
their
betrayal

made
to
examine
separately
each
of
the
phases
of
the
empire
little
need
be
said
in
conclusion
upon
its
nature
and
results
in
general
a
general
character
can
hardly
help
being
either
vague
or
false
for
the
aspects
which
the
empire
took
are
as
many
and
as
various
as
the
ages
and
conditions
of
society
during
which
it
continued
to
exist
among
the
exhausted
peoples
around
the
mediterranean
whose
national
feeling
had
died
out
whose
faith
was
extinct
or
turned
to
superstition
whose
thought
and
art
was
a
faint
imitation
of
the
greek
there
arises
a
huge
despotism
first
of
a
city
then
of
an
administrative
system
which
presses
with
equal
weight
on
all
its
subjects
and
becomes
to
them
a
religion
as
well
as
a
government
just
when
the
mass
is
at
length
dissolving
the
tribes
of
the
north
come
down
too
rude
to
maintain
the
institutions
they
found
subsisting
too
few
to
introduce
their
own
and
a
weltering
confusion
follows
till
the
strong
hand
of
the
first
frankish
emperor
raises
the
fallen
image
and
bids
the
nations
bow
down
to
it
once
more
under
him
it
is
for
some
brief
space
a
theocracy
under
his
german
successors
the
first

the
centre
of
european
chivalry
as
feudalism
wanes
it
is
again
transformed
and
after
promising
for
a
time
to
become

hereditary

sinks
at

into
the

not
more
dignified
than
powerless

an
international
league
to
us
moderns
a
perpetuation
under
conditions
so
diverse
of
the
same
name
and
the
same
pretensions
appears
at
first
sight
absurd
a
phantom
too
vain
to
impress
the
most
superstitious
mind
closer
examination
will
correct
such
a
notion
no
power
was
ever
based
on
foundations
so
sure
and
deep
as
those
which
rome
laid
during
three
centuries
of
conquest
and
four
of
undisturbed
dominion
if
her
empire
had
been
an
hereditary
or
local
kingdom
it
might
have
fallen
with
the
extinction
of
the
royal
line
the
conquest
of
the
tribe
the
destruction
of
the
city
to
which
it
was
attached
but
it
was
not
so
limited
it
was
imperishable
because
it
was
universal
and
when
its
power
had
ceased
it
was
remembered
with
awe
and
love
by
the
races
whose
separate
existence
it
had
destroyed
because
it
had
spared
the
weak
while
it
smote
down
the
strong
because
it
had
granted
equal
rights
to
all
and
closed
against
none
of
its
subjects
the
path
of
honourable
ambition
when
the

that
had
escorted

yet
in
no
one
of

has
there
been
that

these
examples
however
are
minor
parallels
the
complement
and
illustration
of
the
history
of
the
empire
is
to
be
found
in
that
of
the
holy
see
the
papacy
whose
spiritual
power
was
itself
the
offspring
of
rome
temporal
dominion
evoked
the
phantom
of
her
parent
used
it
obeyed
it
rebelled
and
overthrew
it
in
its
old
age
once
more
embraced
it
till
in
its
downfall
she
has
heard
the
knell
of
her
own
approaching
doom
both
papacy
and
empire
rose
in
an
age
when
the
human
spirit
was
utterly
prostrated
before
authority
and
tradition
when
the
exercise
of
private
judgment
was
impossible
to
most
and
sinful
to
all
those
who
believed
the
miracles
recorded
in
the
and
did
not
question
the
isidorian
decretals
might
well
recognize
as
ordained
of
god
the
twofold
authority
of
rome
founded
as
it
seemed
to
be
on
so
many
texts
of
scripture
and
confirmed
by
five
centuries
of
undisputed
possession
both
sanctioned
and
satisfied
the
passion
of
the
middle
ages
for
unity
ferocity
violence
disorder
were
the
conspicuous
evils
of
that
time
hence
all
the
aspirations
of
the
good
were
for
something
which
breaking
the
force
of
passion
and
increasing
the
force
of
sympathy
should
teach
the
stubborn
wills
to
sacrifice
themselves
in
the
view
of
a
common
purpose
to
those
men
moreover
unable
to
rise
above
the
sensuous
not
seeing
the
true
connexion
or
the
true
difference
of
the
spiritual
and
the
secular
the
idea
of
the
visible
church
was
full
of
awful
meaning
solitary
thought
was
helpless
and
strove
to
lose
itself
in
the
aggregate
since
it
could
not
create
for
itself
that
which
was
universal
the
schism
that
severed
a
man
from
the
congregation
of
the
faithful
on
earth
was
hardly
less
dreadful
than
the
heresy
which
excluded
him
from
the
company
of
the
blessed
in
heaven
he
who
kept
not
his
appointed
place
in
the
ranks
of
the
church
militant
had
no
right
to
swell
the
rejoicing
anthems
of
the
church
triumphant
here
as
in
so
many
other
cases
the
continued
use
of
traditional
language
seems
to
have
prevented
us
from
seeing
how
great
is
the
difference
between
our
own
times
and
those
in
which
the
phrases
we
repeat
were
first
used
and
used
in
full
sincerity
whether
the
world
is
better
or
worse
for
the
change
which
has
passed
upon
its
feelings
in
these
matters
is
another
question
all
that
it
is
necessary
to
note
here
is
that
the
change
is
a
profound
and
pervading
one
obedience
almost
the
first
of
mediæval
virtues
is
now
often
spoken
of
as
if
it
were
fit
only
for
slaves
or
fools
instead
of
praising
men
are
wont
to
condemn
the
submission
of
the
individual
will
the
surrender
of
the
individual
belief
to
the
will
or
the
belief
of
the
community
some
persons
declare
variety
of
opinion
to
be
a
positive
good
the
great
mass
have
certainly
no
longing
for
an
abstract
unity
of
faith
they
have
no
horror
of
schism
they
do
not
can
not
understand
the
intense
fascination
which
the
idea
of
one
church
exercised
upon
their
mediæval
forefathers
a
life
in
the
church
for
the
church
through
the
church
a
life
which
she
blessed
in
mass
at
morning
and
sent
to
peaceful
rest
by
the
vesper
hymn
a
life
which
she
supported
by
the
constantly
recurring
stimulus
of
the
sacraments
relieving
it
by
confession
purifying
it
by
penance
admonishing
it
by
the
presentation
of
visible
objects
for
contemplation
and
worship
this
was
the
life
which
they
of
the
middle
ages
conceived
of
as
the
rightful
life
for
man
it
was
the
actual
life
of
many
the
ideal
of
all
the
unseen
world
was
so
unceasingly
pointed
to
and
its
dependence
on
the
seen
so
intensely
felt
that
the
barrier
between
the
two
seemed
to
disappear
the
church
was
not
merely
the
portal
to
heaven
it
was
heaven
anticipated
it
was
already
and
complete
in
one
sentence
from
a
famous
mediæval
document
may
be
found
a
key
to
much
which
seems
strangest
to
us
in
the
feelings
of
the
middle
ages
church
is
dearer
to
god
than
heaven
for
the
church
does
not
exist
for
the
sake
of
heaven
but
conversely
heaven
for
the
sake
of
the
church
again
both
empire
and
papacy
rested
on
opinion
rather
than
on
physical
force
and
when
the
struggle
of
the
eleventh
century
came
the
empire
fell
because
its
rival
hold
over
the
souls
of
men
was
firmer
more
direct
enforced
by
penalties
more
terrible
than
the
death
of
the
body
the
ecclesiastical
body
under
alexander
and
innocent
was
animated
by
a
loftier
spirit
and
more
wholly
devoted
to
a
single
aim
than
the
knights
and
nobles
who
followed
the
banner
of
the
swabian
cæsars
its
allegiance
was
undivided
it
comprehended
the
principles
for
which
it
fought
they
trembled
at
even
while
they
resisted
the
spiritual
power
sidenote
papacy
and
empire
compared
as
perpetuations
of
a
name
both
sprang
from
what
might
be
called
the
accident
of
name
the
power
of
the
great
latin
patriarchate
was
a
form
the
ghost
it
has
been
said
of
the
older
empire
favoured
in
its
growth
by
circumstances
but
really
vital
because
capable
of
wonderful
adaptation
to
the
character
and
wants
of
the
time
so
too
though
far
less
perfectly
was
the
empire
its
form
was
the
tradition
of
the
universal
rule
of
rome
it
met
the
needs
of
successive
centuries
by
civilizing
barbarous
peoples
by
maintaining
unity
in
confusion
and
disorganization
by
controlling
brute
violence
through
the
sanctions
of
a
higher
power
by
being
made
the
keystone
of
a
gigantic
feudal
arch
by
assuming
in
its
old
age
the
presidency
of
a
european
confederation
and
the
history
of
both
as
it
shews
the
power
of
ancient
names
and
forms
shews
also
within
what
limits
such
a
perpetuation
is
possible
and
how
it
sometimes
deceives
men
by
preserving
the
shadow
while
it
loses
the
substance
this
perpetuation
itself
what
is
it
but
the
expression
of
the
belief
of
mankind
a
belief
incessantly
corrected
yet
never
weakened
that
their
old
institutions
do
and
may
continue
to
subsist
unchanged
that
what
has
served
their
fathers
will
do
well
enough
for
them
that
it
is
possible
to
make
a
system
perfect
and
abide
in
it
for
ever
of
all
political
instincts
this
is
perhaps
the
strongest
often
useful
often
grossly
abused
but
never
so
natural
and
so
fitting
as
when
it
leads
men
who
feel
themselves
inferior
to
their
predecessors
to
save
what
they
can
from
the
wreck
of
a
civilization
higher
than
their
own
it
was
thus
that
both
papacy
and
empire
were
maintained
by
the
generations
who
had
no
type
of
greatness
and
wisdom
save
that
which
they
associated
with
the
name
of
rome
and
therefore
it
is
that
no
examples
shew
so
convincingly
how
hopeless
are
all
such
attempts
to
preserve
in
life
a
system
which
arose
out
of
ideas
and
under
conditions
that
have
passed
away
though
it
never
could
have
existed
save
as
a
prolongation
though
it
was
and
remained
through
the
middle
ages
an
anachronism
the
empire
of
the
tenth
century
had
little
in
common
with
the
empire
of
the
second
much
more
was
the
papacy
though
it
too
hankered
after
the
forms
and
titles
of
antiquity
in
reality
a
new
creation
and
in
the
same
proportion
as
it
was
new
and
represented
the
spirit
not
of
a
past
age
but
of
its
own
was
it
a
power
stronger
and
more
enduring
than
the
empire
more
enduring
because
younger
and
so
in
fuller
harmony
with
the
feelings
of
its
contemporaries
stronger
because
at
the
head
of
the
great
ecclesiastical
body
in
and
through
which
rather
than
through
secular
life
all
the
intelligence
and
political
activity
of
the
middle
ages
sought
its
expression
the
famous
simile
of
gregory
the
seventh
is
that
which
best
describes
the
empire
and
the
popedom
they
were
indeed
the
lights
in
the
firmament
of
the
militant
church
the
lights
which
illumined
and
ruled
the
world
all
through
the
middle
ages
and
as
moonlight
is
to
sunlight
so
was
the
empire
to
the
papacy
the
rays
of
the
one
were
borrowed
feeble
often
interrupted
the
other
shone
with
an
unquenchable
brilliance
that
was
all
her
own
sidenote
in
what
sense
was
the
empire
roman
the
empire
it
has
just
been
said
was
never
truly
mediæval
was
it
then
roman
in
anything
but
name
and
was
that
name
anything
better
than
a
piece
of
fantastic
antiquarianism
it
is
easy
to
draw
a
comparison
between
the
antonines
and
the
ottos
which
should
shew
nothing
but
unlikeness
what
the
empire
was
in
the
second
century
every
one
knows
in
the
tenth
it
was
a
feudal
monarchy
resting
on
a
strong
territorial
oligarchy
its
chiefs
were
barbarians
the
sons
of
those
who
had
destroyed
varus
and
baffled
germanicus
sometimes
unable
even
to
use
the
tongue
of
rome
its
powers
were
limited
it
could
scarcely
be
said
to
have
a
regular
organization
at
all
whether
judicial
or
administrative
it
was
consecrated
to
the
defence
nay
it
existed
by
virtue
of
the
religion
which
trajan
and
marcus
had
persecuted
nevertheless
when
the
contrast
has
been
stated
in
the
strongest
terms
there
will
remain
points
of
resemblance
the
thoroughly
roman
idea
of
universal
denationalization
survived
and
drew
with
it
that
of
a
certain
equality
among
all
free
subjects
it
has
been
remarked
already
that
the
world
highest
dignity
was
for
many
centuries
the
only
civil
office
to
which
any
christian
was
legally
eligible
and
there
was
also
during
the
earlier
ages
that
indomitable
vigour
which
might
have
made
trajan
or
severus
seek
their
true
successors
among
the
woods
of
germany
rather
than
in
the
palaces
of
byzantium
where
every
office
and
name
and
custom
had
floated
down
from
the
court
of
constantine
in
a
stream
of
unbroken
legitimacy
the
ceremonies
of
henry
the
seventh
coronation
would
have
been
strange
indeed
to
caius
julius
cæsar
octavianus
augustus
but
how
much
nobler
how
much
more
roman
in
force
and
truth
than
the
childish
and
unmeaning
forms
with
which
a
palæologus
was
installed
it
was
not
in
purple
buskins
that
the
dignity
of
the
luxemburger
lay
to
such
a
boast
the
germanic
empire
had
long
ere
its
death
lost
right
it
had
lived
on
when
honour
and
nature
bade
it
die
it
had
become
what
the
empire
of
the
moguls
was
and
that
of
the
ottomans
is
now
a
curious
relic
of
antiquity
over
which
the
imaginative
might
muse
but
which
the
mass
of
men
would
push
aside
with
impatient
contempt
but
institutions
like
men
should
be
judged
by
their
prime
sidenote
roman
french
and
mediæval
sidenote
political
character
of
the
teutonic
and
gallic
races
the
comparison
of
the
old
roman
empire
with
its
germanic
representative
raises
a
question
which
has
been
a
good
deal
canvassed
of
late
years
that
wonderful
system
which
julius
cæsar
and
his
subtle
nephew
erected
upon
the
ruins
of
the
republican
constitution
of
rome
has
been
made
the
type
of
a
certain
form
of
government
and
of
a
certain
set
of
social
as
well
as
political
arrangements
to
which
or
rather
to
the
theory
whereof
they
are
a
part
there
has
been
given
the
name
of
imperialism
the
sacrifice
of
the
individual
to
the
mass
the
concentration
of
all
legislative
and
judicial
powers
in
the
person
of
the
sovereign
the
centralization
of
the
administrative
system
the
maintenance
of
order
by
a
large
military
force
the
substitution
of
the
influence
of
public
opinion
for
the
control
of
representative
assemblies
are
commonly
taken
whether
rightly
or
wrongly
to
characterize
that
theory
its
enemies
can
not
deny
that
it
has
before
now
given
and
may
again
give
to
nations
a
sudden
and
violent
access
of
aggressive
energy
that
it
has
often
achieved
the
glory
whatever
that
may
be
of
war
and
conquest
that
it
has
a
better
title
to
respect
in
the
ease
with
which
it
may
be
made
as
it
was
by
the
flavian
and
antonine
cæsars
of
old
and
at
the
beginning
of
this
century
by
napoleon
in
france
the
instrument
of
comprehensive
reforms
in
law
and
government
the
parallel
between
the
roman
world
under
the
cæsars
and
the
french
people
now
is
indeed
less
perfect
than
those
who
dilate
upon
it
fancy
that
equalizing
despotism
which
was
a
good
to
a
medley
of
tribes
the
force
of
whose
national
life
had
spent
itself
and
left
them
languid
yet
restless
with
all
the
evils
of
isolation
and
none
of
its
advantages
is
not
necessarily
a
good
to
a
country
already
the
strongest
and
most
united
in
europe
a
country
where
the
administration
is
only
too
perfect
and
the
pressure
of
social
uniformity
only
too
strong
but
whether
it
be
a
good
or
an
evil
no
one
can
doubt
that
france
represents
and
has
always
represented
the
imperialist
spirit
of
rome
far
more
truly
than
those
whom
the
middle
ages
recognized
as
the
legitimate
heirs
of
her
name
and
dominion
in
the
political
character
of
the
french
people
whether
it
be
the
result
of
the
five
centuries
of
roman
rule
in
gaul
or
rather
due
to
the
original
instincts
of
the
gallic
race
is
to
be
found
their
claim
a
claim
better
founded
than
any
which
napoleon
put
forward
to
be
the
romans
of
the
modern
world
the
tendency
of
the
teuton
was
and
is
to
the
independence
of
the
individual
life
to
the
mutual
repulsion
if
the
phrase
may
be
permitted
of
the
social
atoms
as
contrasted
with
keltic
and
romanic
peoples
among
which
the
unit
is
more
completely
absorbed
in
the
mass
who
live
possessed
by
a
common
idea
which
they
are
driven
to
realize
in
the
concrete
teutonic
states
have
been
little
more
successful
than
their
neighbours
in
the
establishment
of
free
constitutions
their
assemblies
meet
and
vote
and
are
dissolved
and
nothing
comes
of
it
their
citizens
endure
without
greatly
resenting
outrages
that
would
raise
the
more
excitable
french
or
italians
in
revolt
but
whatever
may
have
been
the
form
of
government
the
body
of
the
people
have
in
germany
always
enjoyed
a
freedom
of
thought
which
has
made
them
comparatively
careless
of
politics
and
the
absolutism
of
the
elbe
is
at
this
day
no
more
like
that
of
the
seine
than
a
revolution
at
dresden
is
to
a
revolution
at
paris
the
rule
of
the
hohenstaufen
had
nothing
either
of
the
good
or
the
evil
of
the
imperialism
which
tacitus
painted
or
of
that
which
the
panegyrists
of
the
present
system
in
france
paint
in
colours
somewhat
different
from
his
sidenote
essential
principles
of
the
mediæval
empire
there
was
nevertheless
such
a
thing
as
mediæval
imperialism
a
theory
of
the
nature
of
the
state
and
the
best
form
of
government
which
has
been
described
once
already
and
need
not
be
described
again
it
is
enough
to
say
that
from
three
leading
principles
all
its
properties
may
be
derived
the
first
and
the
least
essential
was
the
existence
of
the
state
as
a
monarchy
the
second
was
the
exact
coincidence
of
the
state
limits
and
the
perfect
harmony
of
its
workings
with
the
limits
and
the
workings
of
the
church
the
third
was
its
universality
these
three
were
vital
forms
of
political
organization
the
presence
or
absence
of
constitutional
checks
the
degree
of
liberty
enjoyed
by
the
subject
the
rights
conceded
to
local
authorities
all
these
were
matters
of
secondary
importance
but
although
there
brooded
over
all
the
shadow
of
a
despotism
it
was
a
despotism
not
of
the
sword
but
of
law
a
despotism
not
chilling
and
blighting
but
one
which
in
germany
at
least
looked
with
favour
on
municipal
freedom
and
everywhere
did
its
best
for
learning
for
religion
for
intelligence
a
despotism
not
hereditary
but
one
which
constantly
maintained
in
theory
the
principle
that
he
should
rule
who
was
found
the
fittest
to
praise
or
to
decry
the
empire
as
a
despotic
power
is
to
misunderstand
it
altogether
we
need
not
because
an
unbounded
prerogative
was
useful
in
ages
of
turbulence
advocate
it
now
nor
need
we
with
sismondi
blame
the
frankish
conqueror
because
he
granted
no
charter
to
all
the
nations
that
obeyed
him
like
the
papacy
the
empire
expressed
the
political
ideas
of
a
time
and
not
of
all
time
like
the
papacy
it
decayed
when
those
ideas
changed
when
men
became
more
capable
of
rational
liberty
when
thought
grew
stronger
and
the
spiritual
nature
shook
itself
more
free
from
the
bonds
of
sense
sidenote
influence
of
the
holy
empire
on
germany
the
influence
of
the
empire
upon
germany
is
a
subject
too
wide
to
be
more
than
glanced
at
here
there
is
much
to
make
it
appear
altogether
unfortunate
for
many
generations
the
flower
of
teutonic
chivalry
crossed
the
alps
to
perish
by
the
sword
of
the
lombards
or
the
deadlier
fevers
of
rome
italy
terribly
avenged
the
wrongs
she
suffered
those
who
destroyed
the
national
existence
of
another
people
forfeited
their
own
the
german
kingdom
crushed
beneath
the
weight
of
the
roman
empire
could
never
recover
strength
enough
to
form
a
compact
and
united
monarchy
such
as
arose
elsewhere
in
europe
the
race
whom
their
neighbours
had
feared
and
obeyed
till
the
fourteenth
century
saw
themselves
down
even
to
our
own
day
the
prey
of
intestine
feuds
and
their
country
the
battlefield
of
europe
spoiled
and
insulted
by
a
neighbour
restlessly
aggressive
and
superior
in
all
the
arts
of
success
they
came
to
regard
france
as
the
persecuted
slave
regards
them
the
want
of
national
union
and
political
liberty
from
which
germany
has
suffered
and
to
some
extent
suffers
still
can
not
be
attributed
to
the
differences
of
her
races
for
conspicuous
as
that
difference
was
in
the
days
of
otto
the
great
it
was
no
greater
than
in
france
where
intruding
franks
goths
burgundians
and
northmen
were
mingled
with
primitive
kelts
and
basques
not
so
great
as
in
spain
or
italy
or
britain
rather
is
it
due
to
the
decline
of
the
central
government
which
was
induced
by
its
strife
with
the
popedom
its
endless
italian
wars
and
the
passion
for
universal
dominion
which
made
it
the
assailant
of
all
the
neighbouring
countries
the
absence
or
the
weakness
of
the
monarch
enabled
his
feudal
vassals
to
establish
petty
despotisms
debarring
the
nation
from
united
political
action
and
greatly
retarding
the
emancipation
of
the
commons
thus
while
the
princes
became
shamelessly
selfish
justifying
their
resistance
to
the
throne
as
the
defence
of
their
own
liberty
liberty
to
oppress
the
subject
and
ready
on
the
least
occasion
to
throw
themselves
into
the
arms
of
france
the
body
of
the
people
were
deprived
of
all
political
training
and
have
found
the
lack
of
such
experience
impede
their
efforts
to
this
day
for
these
misfortunes
however
there
has
not
been
wanting
some
compensation
the
inheritance
of
the
roman
empire
made
the
germans
the
ruling
race
of
europe
and
the
brilliance
of
that
glorious
dawn
can
never
fade
entirely
from
their
name
a
peaceful
people
now
peaceful
in
sentiment
even
now
when
they
have
become
a
great
military
power
submissive
to
paternal
government
and
given
to
the
quiet
enjoyments
of
art
music
and
meditation
they
delight
themselves
with
memories
of
the
time
when
their
conquering
chivalry
was
the
terror
of
the
gaul
and
the
slave
the
lombard
and
the
saracen
the
national
life
received
a
keen
stimulus
from
the
sense
of
exaltation
which
victory
brought
and
from
the
intercourse
with
countries
where
the
old
civilization
had
not
wholly
perished
it
was
this
connexion
with
italy
that
raised
the
german
lands
out
of
barbarism
and
did
for
them
the
work
which
roman
conquest
had
performed
in
gaul
spain
and
britain
from
the
empire
flowed
all
the
richness
of
their
mediæval
life
and
literature
it
first
awoke
in
them
a
consciousness
of
national
existence
its
history
has
inspired
and
served
as
material
to
their
poetry
to
many
ardent
politicians
the
splendours
of
the
past
have
become
the
beacon
of
the
future
there
is
a
bright
side
even
to
their
political
disunion
when
they
complain
that
they
are
not
a
nation
and
sigh
for
the
harmony
of
feeling
and
singleness
of
aim
which
their
great
rival
displays
the
example
of
the
greeks
may
comfort
them
to
the
variety
which
so
many
small
governments
have
produced
may
be
partly
attributed
the
breadth
of
development
in
german
thought
and
literature
by
virtue
of
which
it
transcends
the
french
hardly
less
than
the
greek
surpassed
the
roman
paris
no
doubt
is
great
but
a
country
may
lose
as
well
as
gain
by
the
predominance
of
a
single
city
and
germany
need
not
mourn
that
she
alone
among
modern
states
has
not
and
never
has
had
a
capital
sidenote
austria
as
heir
of
the
holy
empire
the
merits
of
the
old
empire
were
not
long
since
the
subject
of
a
brisk
controversy
among
several
german
professors
of
history
the
spokesmen
of
the
austrian
or
roman
catholic
party
a
party
which
ten
years
ago
was
not
less
powerful
in
some
of
the
minor
south
german
states
than
in
vienna
claimed
for
the
hapsburg
monarchy
the
honour
of
being
the
legitimate
representative
of
the
mediæval
empire
and
declared
that
only
by
again
accepting
hapsburg
leadership
could
germany
win
back
the
glory
and
the
strength
that
once
were
hers
the
north
german
liberals
ironically
applauded
the
comparison
they
replied
austrian
empire
as
it
calls
itself
is
the
true
daughter
of
the
old
despotism
not
less
tyrannical
not
less
aggressive
not
less
retrograde
like
its
progenitor
the
friend
of
priests
the
enemy
of
free
thought
the
trampler
upon
the
national
feeling
of
the
peoples
that
obey
it
it
is
you
whose
selfish
and
policy
blasts
the
hope
of
german
unity
now
as
otto
and
frederick
blasted
it
long
ago
by
their
schemes
of
foreign
conquest
the
dream
of
empire
has
been
our
bane
from
first
to
last
it
is
possible
one
may
hope
to
escape
the
alternative
of
admiring
the
austrian
empire
or
denouncing
the
holy
roman
austria
has
indeed
in
some
things
but
too
faithfully
reproduced
the
policy
of
the
saxon
and
swabian
cæsars
like
her
they
oppressed
and
insulted
the
italian
people
but
it
was
in
the
defence
of
rights
which
the
italians
themselves
admitted
like
her
they
lusted
after
a
dominion
over
the
races
on
their
borders
but
that
dominion
was
to
them
a
means
of
spreading
civilization
and
religion
in
savage
countries
not
of
pampering
upon
their
revenues
a
hated
court
and
aristocracy
like
her
they
strove
to
maintain
a
strong
government
at
home
but
they
did
it
when
a
strong
government
was
the
first
of
political
blessings
like
her
they
gathered
and
maintained
vast
armies
but
those
armies
were
composed
of
knights
and
barons
who
lived
for
war
alone
not
of
peasants
torn
away
from
useful
labour
and
condemned
to
the
cruel
task
of
perpetuating
their
own
bondage
by
crushing
the
aspirations
of
another
nationality
they
sinned
grievously
no
doubt
but
they
sinned
in
the
dim
twilight
of
a
age
not
in
the
noonday
blaze
of
modern
civilization
the
enthusiasm
for
mediæval
faith
and
simplicity
which
was
so
fervid
some
years
ago
has
run
its
course
and
is
not
likely
soon
to
revive
he
who
reads
the
history
of
the
middle
ages
will
not
deny
that
its
heroes
even
the
best
of
them
were
in
some
respects
little
better
than
savages
but
when
he
approaches
more
recent
times
and
sees
how
during
the
last
three
hundred
years
kings
have
dealt
with
their
subjects
and
with
each
other
he
will
forget
the
ferocity
of
the
middle
ages
in
horror
at
the
heartlessness
the
treachery
the
injustice
all
the
more
odious
because
it
sometimes
wears
the
mask
of
legality
which
disgraces
the
annals
of
the
military
monarchies
of
europe
with
regard
however
to
the
pretensions
of
modern
austria
the
truth
is
that
this
dispute
about
the
worth
of
the
old
system
has
no
bearing
upon
them
at
all
the
day
of
imperial
greatness
was
already
past
when
rudolf
the
first
hapsburg
reached
the
throne
while
during
what
may
be
called
the
austrian
period
from
maximilian
to
francis
ii
the
holy
empire
was
to
germany
a
mere
clog
and
incumbrance
which
the
unhappy
nation
bore
because
she
knew
not
how
to
rid
herself
of
it
the
germans
are
welcome
to
appeal
to
the
old
empire
to
prove
that
they
were
once
a
united
people
nor
is
there
any
harm
in
their
comparing
the
politics
of
the
twelfth
century
with
those
of
the
nineteenth
although
to
argue
from
the
one
to
the
other
seems
to
betray
a
want
of
historical
judgment
but
the
one
thing
which
is
wholly
absurd
is
to
make
francis
joseph
of
austria
the
successor
of
frederick
of
hohenstaufen
and
justify
the
most
sordid
and
ungenial
of
modern
despotisms
by
the
example
of
the
mirror
of
mediæval
chivalry
the
noblest
creation
of
mediæval
thought
sidenote
bearing
of
the
empire
upon
the
progress
of
european
civilization
sidenote
influence
upon
modern
jurisprudence
we
are
not
yet
far
enough
from
the
empire
to
comprehend
or
state
rightly
its
bearing
on
european
progress
the
mountain
lies
behind
us
but
miles
must
be
traversed
before
we
can
take
in
at
a
glance
its
peaks
and
slopes
and
buttresses
picture
its
form
and
conjecture
its
height
of
the
perpetuation
among
the
peoples
of
the
west
of
the
arts
and
literature
of
rome
it
was
both
an
effect
and
a
cause
a
cause
only
less
powerful
than
the
church
it
would
be
endless
to
shew
in
how
many
ways
it
affected
the
political
institutions
of
the
middle
ages
and
through
them
of
the
whole
civilized
world
most
of
the
attributes
of
modern
royalty
to
take
the
most
obvious
instance
belonged
originally
and
properly
to
the
emperor
and
were
borrowed
from
him
by
other
monarchs
the
once
famous
doctrine
of
divine
right
had
the
same
origin
to
the
existence
of
the
empire
is
chiefly
to
be
ascribed
the
prevalence
of
roman
law
through
europe
and
its
practical
importance
in
our
own
days
for
while
in
southern
france
and
central
italy
where
the
subject
population
greatly
outnumbered
their
conquerors
the
old
system
would
have
in
any
case
survived
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
in
germany
as
in
england
a
body
of
customary
teutonic
law
would
have
grown
up
had
it
not
been
for
the
notion
that
since
the
german
monarch
was
the
legitimate
successor
of
justinian
the
corpus
juris
must
be
binding
on
all
his
subjects
this
strange
idea
was
received
with
a
faith
so
unhesitating
that
even
the
aristocracy
who
naturally
disliked
a
system
which
the
emperors
and
the
cities
favoured
could
not
but
admit
its
validity
and
before
the
end
of
the
middle
ages
roman
law
prevailed
through
all
germany
when
it
is
considered
how
great
are
the
services
which
german
writers
have
rendered
and
continue
to
render
to
the
study
of
scientific
jurisprudence
this
result
will
appear
far
from
insignificant
but
another
of
still
wider
import
followed
when
by
the
peace
of
westphalia
a
crowd
of
petty
principalities
were
recognized
as
practically
independent
states
the
need
of
a
code
to
regulate
their
intercourse
became
pressing
that
code
grotius
and
his
successors
formed
out
of
what
was
then
the
private
law
of
germany
which
thus
became
the
foundation
whereon
the
system
of
international
jurisprudence
has
been
built
up
during
the
last
two
centuries
that
system
is
indeed
entirely
a
german
creation
and
could
have
arisen
in
no
country
where
the
law
of
rome
had
not
been
the
fountain
of
legal
ideas
and
the
groundwork
of
positive
codes
in
germany
too
was
it
first
carried
out
in
practice
and
that
with
a
success
which
is
the
best
some
might
say
the
only
title
of
the
later
empire
to
the
grateful
remembrance
of
mankind
under
its
protecting
shade
small
princedoms
and
free
cities
lived
unmolested
beside
states
like
saxony
and
bavaria
each
member
of
the
germanic
body
feeling
that
the
rights
of
the
weakest
of
his
brethren
were
also
his
own
sidenote
influence
of
the
empire
upon
the
history
of
the
church
sidenote
nature
of
the
question
at
issue
between
the
emperors
and
the
popes
the
most
important
chapter
in
the
history
of
the
empire
is
that
which
describes
its
relation
to
the
church
and
the
papacy
of
the
ecclesiastical
power
it
was
alternately
the
champion
and
the
enemy
in
the
ninth
and
tenth
centuries
the
emperors
extended
the
dominion
of
peter
chair
in
the
tenth
and
eleventh
they
rescued
it
from
an
abyss
of
guilt
and
shame
to
be
the
instrument
of
their
own
downfall
the
struggle
which
gregory
the
seventh
began
although
it
was
political
rather
than
religious
awoke
in
the
teutonic
nations
a
hostility
to
the
pretensions
of
the
romish
court
that
struggle
ended
with
the
death
of
the
last
hohenstaufen
in
the
victory
of
the
priesthood
a
victory
whose
abuse
by
the
insolent
and
greedy
pontiffs
of
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
centuries
made
it
more
ruinous
than
a
defeat
the
anger
which
had
long
smouldered
in
the
breasts
of
the
northern
nations
of
europe
burst
out
in
the
sixteenth
with
a
violence
which
alarmed
those
whom
it
had
hitherto
defended
and
made
the
emperors
once
more
the
allies
of
the
popedom
and
the
partners
of
its
declining
fortunes
but
the
nature
of
that
alliance
and
of
the
hostility
which
had
preceded
it
must
not
be
misunderstood
it
is
a
natural
but
not
the
less
a
serious
error
to
suppose
as
modern
writers
often
seem
to
do
that
the
pretensions
of
the
empire
and
the
popedom
were
mutually
exclusive
that
each
claimed
all
the
rights
spiritual
and
secular
of
a
universal
monarch
so
far
was
this
from
being
the
case
that
we
find
mediæval
writers
and
statesmen
even
emperors
and
popes
themselves
expressly
recognizing
a
divinely
appointed
duality
of
government
two
potentates
each
supreme
in
the
sphere
of
his
own
activity
peter
in
things
eternal
cæsar
in
things
temporal
the
relative
position
of
the
two
does
indeed
in
course
of
time
undergo
a
signal
alteration
in
the
days
of
charles
the
barbarous
age
of
modern
europe
when
men
were
and
could
not
but
be
governed
chiefly
by
physical
force
the
emperor
was
practically
if
not
theoretically
the
grander
figure
four
centuries
later
in
the
era
of
pope
innocent
the
third
when
the
power
of
ideas
had
grown
stronger
in
the
world
and
was
able
to
resist
or
to
bend
to
its
service
the
arms
and
the
wealth
of
men
we
see
the
balance
inclined
the
other
way
spiritual
authority
is
conceived
of
as
being
of
a
nature
so
high
and
holy
that
it
must
inspire
and
guide
the
civil
administration
but
it
is
not
proposed
to
supplant
that
administration
nor
to
degrade
its
head
the
great
struggle
of
the
eleventh
and
two
following
centuries
does
not
aim
at
the
annihilation
of
one
or
other
power
but
turns
solely
upon
the
character
of
their
connexion
hildebrand
the
typical
representative
of
the
popedom
requires
the
obedience
of
the
emperor
on
the
ground
of
his
own
personal
responsibility
for
the
souls
of
their
common
subjects
he
demands
not
that
the
functions
of
temporal
government
shall
be
directly
committed
to
himself
but
that
they
shall
be
exercised
in
conformity
with
the
will
of
god
whereof
he
is
the
exponent
the
imperialist
party
had
no
means
of
meeting
this
argument
for
they
could
not
deny
the
spiritual
supremacy
of
the
pope
nor
the
transcendant
importance
of
eternal
salvation
they
could
therefore
only
protest
that
the
emperor
being
also
divinely
appointed
was
directly
answerable
to
god
and
remind
the
pope
that
his
kingdom
was
not
of
this
world
there
was
in
truth
no
way
out
of
the
difficulty
for
it
was
caused
by
the
attempt

of
no
severance

and

life
for
the
future
and
life
in
the
present
what
it
is
most
pertinent
to
remark
is
that
neither
combatant
pushed
his
theory
to
extremities
since
he
felt
that
his
adversary
title
rested
on
the
same
foundations
as
his
own
the
strife
was
keenest
at
the
time
when
the
whole
world
believed
fervently
in

forsaken

that
which
may
be
called
the
inner

momentous
in

minds
of
men
than
were
its
outward
dealings
with
the
roman
church

her
greatness
and

the
middle
ages
men
conceived
of
the
communion
of
the
saints
as
the
formal
unity
of
an
organized
body
of
worshippers
and
found
the
concrete
realization
of
that
conception
in

subsists
or

subsist
between
the
church
and

state
this
is
not
the
place
to
inquire
that
the
form
which
it
took
in
the
middle
ages
was
always
imperfect
and
became
eventually
rigid
and
unprogressive
was
sufficiently
proved
by
the
event
but
by
it
the
european
peoples
were
saved
from
the
isolation
and
narrowness
and
jealous
exclusiveness
which
had
checked
the
growth
of
the
earlier
civilizations
of
the
world
and
which
we
see
now
lying
like
a
weight
upon
the
kingdoms
of
the
east

were
brought
into
that
mutual
knowledge
and
which
is
the
condition
if
it
be
not
the
source
of
all
true
culture
and
progress
for
as
by
the
roman
empire
of
old
the
nations
were
first
forced
to
own
a
common
sway
so
by
the
empire
of
the
middle
ages
was
preserved
the
feeling
of
a
brotherhood
of
mankind
a
commonwealth
of
the
whole

sublime
unity
transcended
every
minor

be
ventured
no

more
frequent

and
the

have
done
much
to
change
the
character

for

prejudice
and
hatred
a
genial
sympathy
and
the
sense
of
a

have
not

no

however
great
her
energy

material
resources
to
repeat
in
modern

the
part
of
ancient
rome
to
gather
into
one
vast
political
body
races
whose
national
individuality
has
grown
more
and
more
marked
in
each
successive
age
nevertheless
it
is
in
great
measure
due
to
rome
and
to
the
roman
empire
of
the
middle
ages
that
the
bonds
of
national
union
are
on
the
whole
both
stronger
and
nobler

there
came

a
tranquil
evening
after
a
sultry

the

broke
once
more
upon

began
their

the

is
it
also
the
glory
of
charles
the

founder
and
of
more
than
one
amongst
his
teutonic
successors
the
work
of
the
mediæval
empire

and
it
fostered
while
seeming
to
oppose
the

that
were

replace

of

the

of
antiquity
in
times
of

oppression
it
set
before
its
subjects
the
duty
of
rational
obedience
to
an
authority
whose
watchwords
were
peace
and
religion
it
kept
alive
when
national
hatreds
were
most
bitter
the
notion
of
a
great
european
commonwealth
and
by
doing
all
this
it
was
in
effect
abolishing
the
need
for
a
centralizing
and
despotic
power
like
itself
it
was
making
men
capable
of
using
national
independence
aright
it
was
teaching
them
to
rise
to
that
conception
of
spontaneous
activity
and
a
freedom
which
is
above
law
but
not
against
it
to
which
national
independence
itself
if
it
is
to
be
a
blessing
at
all
must
be
only
a
means
those
who
mark
what
has
been
the
tendency
of
events
since
and
who
remember
how
many
of
the
crimes
and
calamities
of
the
past
are
still
but
half
redressed
need
not
be
surprised
to
see
the
principle
of
nationalities
advocated
with
honest
devotion
as
the
final
and
perfect
form
of
political
development
but
such
undistinguishing
advocacy
is
after
all
only
the
old
error
in
a
new
shape
if
all
other
history
did
not
bid
us
beware
the
habit
of
taking
the
problems
and
the
conditions
of
our
own
age
for
those
of
all
time
the
warning
which
the
empire
gives
might
alone
be
warning
enough
from
the
days
of
augustus
down
to
those
of
charles
the
fifth
the
whole
civilized
world
believed
in
its
existence
as
a
part
of
the
eternal
fitness
of
things
and
christian
theologians
were
not
behind
heathen
poets
in
declaring
that
when
it
perished
the
world
would
perish
with
it
yet
the
empire
is
gone
and
the
world
remains
and
hardly
notes
the
change
sidenote
difficulties
arising
from
the
nature
of
the
subject
this
is
but
a
small
part
of
what
might
be
said
upon
an
almost
inexhaustible
theme
inexhaustible
not
from
its
extent
but
from
its
profundity
not
because
there
is
so
much
to
say
but
because
pursue
we
it
never
so
far
more
will
remain
unexpressed
since
incapable
of
expression
for
that
which
it
is
at
once
most
necessary
and
least
possible
to
do
is
to
look
at
the
empire
as
a
whole
a
single
institution
in
which
centres
the
history
of
eighteen
centuries
whose
outer
form
is
the
same
while
its
essence
and
spirit
are
constantly
changing
it
is
when
we
come
to
consider
it
in
this
light
that
the
difficulties
of
so
vast
a
subject
are
felt
in
all
their
force
try
to
explain
in
words
the
theory
and
inner
meaning
of
the
holy
empire
as
it
appeared
to
the
saints
and
poets
of
the
middle
ages
and
that
which
we
can
not
but
conceive
as
noble
and
fertile
in
its
life
sinks
into
a
heap
of
barren
and
scarcely
intelligible
formulas

has
been
able
to
describe
the
papacy
in
the
power
it
once
wielded
over
the
hearts
and
imaginations
of
men

persons

nothing

a

of

are
hardly
further
from
entering
into
the
mystery
of
its
being

the
complacent

who
explains
in
neat
phrases
the
process
of
its

analyses
it
as
a
clever
piece
of

enumerates

measures
the
interests
it
appealed
to
and
gives
in
conclusion
a
sort
of
tabular

of
its
results

good
and
for
evil

too
is
the

not
that
it
is
impossible
to
discover
the

sustained

that
the

of
those
beliefs
can
not
be
adequately
apprehended
by
men
whose
minds
have
been
differently
trained

whose
imaginations
are
fired
by
different

something
yet
still
how
little
we
should
know
of
it

we
knew
what
were
the

fairly
than
we
still
living
in

all
that

hope
to
do

to
whom
it

we
can
not
so
much
as

of

and
holstein
the
history
of
the
relations
of
denmark
and
the
duchies
to
the
empire
is
a
very
small
part
of
the
great
controversy
but
having
been
unnecessarily
mixed
up
with
two
questions
properly
quite
distinct
the
first
as
to
the
relation
of
schleswig
to
holstein
and
of
both
jointly
to
the
danish
crown
the
second
as
to
the
diplomatic
engagements
which
the
danish
kings
have
in
recent
times
contracted
with
the
german
powers
it
has
borne
its
part
in
making
the
whole
question
the
most
intricate
and
interminable
that
has
vexed
europe
for
two
centuries
and
a
half
setting
aside
irrelevant
matter
the
facts
as
to
the
empire
are
as
follows
i
the
danish
kings
began
to
own
the
supremacy
of
the
frankish
emperors
early
in
the
ninth
century
having
recovered
their
independence
in
the
confusion
that
followed
the
fall
of
the
carolingian
dynasty
they
were
again
subdued
by
henry
the
fowler
and
otto
the
great
and
continued
tolerably
submissive
till
the
death
of
frederick
ii
and
the
period
of
anarchy
which
followed
since
that
time
denmark
has
been
always
independent
although
her
king
was
until
the
treaty
of
a
member
of
the
german
confederation
for
holstein
ii
schleswig
was
in
carolingian
times
danish
the
eyder
being
as
eginhard
tells
us
the
boundary
between
saxonia
transalbiana
holstein
and
the
terra
nortmannorum
wherein
lay
the
town
of
sliesthorp
inhabited
by
the
scandinavian
heathen
otto
the
great
conquered
all
schleswig
and
it
is
said
jutland
also
and
added
the
southern
part
of
schleswig
to
the
immediate
territory
of
the
empire
erecting
it
into
a
margraviate
so
it
remained
till
the
days
of
conrad
ii
who
made
the
eyder
again
the
boundary
retaining
of
course
his
suzerainty
over
the
kingdom
of
denmark
as
a
whole
but
by
this
time
the
colonization
of
schleswig
by
the
germans
had
begun
and
ever
since
the
numbers
of
the
danish
population
seem
to
have
steadily
declined
and
the
mass
of
the
people
to
have
grown
more
and
more
disposed
to
sympathize
with
their
southern
rather
than
their
northern
neighbours
iii
holstein
always
was
an
integral
part
of
the
empire
as
it
is
at
this
day

note
on
certain
imperial
titles
and
ceremonies
this
subject
is
a
great
deal
too
wide
and
too
intricate
to
be
more
than
touched
upon
here
but
a
few
brief
statements
may
have
their
use
for
the
practice
of
the
germanic
emperors
varied
so
greatly
from
time
to
time
that
the
reader
becomes
hopelessly
perplexed
without
some
clue
and
if
there
were
space
to
explain
the
causes
of
each
change
of
title
it
would
be
seen
that
the
subject
dry
as
it
may
appear
is
very
far
from
being
a
barren
or
a
dull
one

is
usually
said
to
have
introduced
the
form
imperator
augustus
but
some
authorities
state
that
it
occurs
in
documents
of
the
time
of
lewis
henry
ii
and
his
successors
not
daring
to
take
the
title
of
emperor
till
crowned
at
rome
in
conformity
with
the
superstitious
notion
which
had
begun
with
charles
the
bald
but
anxious
to
claim
the
sovereignty
of
rome
as
indissolubly
attached
to
the
german
crown
began
to
call
themselves
romanorum
the
title
did
not
however
become
common
or
regular
till
the
time
of
henry
iv
in
whose
proclamations
it
occurs
constantly
from
the
eleventh
century
till
the
sixteenth
the
invariable
practice
was
for
the
monarch
to
be
called
rex
semper
augustus
till
his
coronation
at
rome
by
the
pope
after
it
imperator
semper
augustus
in
maximilian

being
refused
a

by
the

a
bull
from

julius
ii
permitting
him
to
call
himself
electus
erwählter
kaiser
this
title
ferdinand
i
brother
of
charles
v
and
all
succeeding
emperors
took
immediately
upon
their
german
coronation
and
it
was
till
their
strict
legal
designation
and
was
always
employed
by
them
in
proclamations
or
other
official
documents
the
term
was
however
omitted
even
in
formal
documents
when
the
sovereign
was
addressed
or
spoken
of
in
the
third
person
and
in
ordinary
practice
he
was
simply
emperor
maximilian
added
the
title
rex
which
had
never
been
known
before
although
the
phrase
germanorum
may
be
found
employed
once
or
twice
in
early
times
teutonicorum
teutonicum
occur
often
in
the
tenth
and
eleventh
centuries
a
great
many
titles
of
less
consequence
were
added
from
time
to
time
charles
the
fifth
had
not
of
course
as
emperor
but
in
virtue
of
his
vast
hereditary
possessions
it
is
perhaps
worth
remarking
that
the
word
emperor
has
not
at
all
the
same
meaning
now
that
it
had
even
so
lately
as
two
centuries
ago
it
is
now
a
commonplace
not
to
say
vulgar
title
somewhat
more
pompous
than
that
of
king
and
supposed
to
belong
especially
to
despots
it
is
given
to
all
sorts
of
barbarous
princes
like
those
of
china
and
abyssinia
in
default
of
a
better
name
it
is
peculiarly
affected
by
new
dynasties
and
has
indeed
grown
so
fashionable
that
what
with
emperors
of
brazil
of
hayti
and
of
mexico
the
good
old
title
of
king
seems
in
a
fair
way
to
become
obsolete
but
in
former
times
there
was
and
could
be
but
one
emperor
he
was
always
mentioned
with
a
certain
reverence
his
name
summoned
up
a
host
of
thoughts
and
associations
which
we
can
not
comprehend
or
sympathize
with
his
office
unlike
that
of
modern
emperors
was
by
its
very
nature
elective
and
not
hereditary
and
so
far
from
resting
on
conquest
or
the
will
of
the
people
rested
on
and
represented
pure
legality
war
could
give
him
nothing
which
law
had
not
given
him
already
the
people
could
delegate
no
power
to
him
who
was
their
lord
and
the
viceroy
of
god
ii
the
crowns
of
the
four
crowns
something
has
been
said
in
the
text
they
were
those
of
germany
taken
at
aachen
of
burgundy
at
arles
of
italy
sometimes
at
pavia
more
usually
at
milan
or
monza
of
the
world
at
rome
the
german
crown
was
taken
by
every
emperor
after
the
time
of
otto
the
great
that
of
italy
by
every
one
or
almost
every
one
who
took
the
roman
down
to
frederick
iii
by
none
after
him
that
of
burgundy
it
would
appear
by
four
emperors
only
conrad
ii
henry
iii
frederick
i
and
charles
iv
the
imperial
crown
was
received
at
rome
by
most
emperors
till
frederick
iii
after
him
by
none
save
charles
v
who
obtained
both
it
and
the
italian
at
bologna
in
a
somewhat
informal
manner
but
down
to
every
emperor
bound
himself
by
his
capitulation
to
proceed
to
rome
to
receive
it
it
should
be
remembered
that
none
of
these
inferior
crowns
was
necessarily
connected
with
that
of
the
roman
empire
which
might
have
been
held
by
a
simple
knight
without
a
foot
of
land
in
the
world
for
as
there
had
been
emperors
lothar
i
lewis
ii
lewis
of
provence
son
of
boso
guy
lambert
and
berengar
who
were
not
kings
of
germany
so
there
were
several
all
those
who
preceded
conrad
ii
who
were
not
kings
of
burgundy
and
others
arnulf
for
example
who
were
not
kings
of
italy
and
it
is
also
worth
remarking
that
although
no
crown
save
the
german
was
assumed
by
the
successors
of
charles
v
their
wider
rights
remained
in
full
force
and
were
never
subsequently
relinquished
there
was
nothing
except
the
practical
difficulty
and
absurdity
of
such
a
project
to
prevent
francis
ii
from
having
himself
crowned
at
arles
milan
and
rome
iii
the
king
of
the
romans
römischer
könig
it
has
been
shewn
above
how
and
why
about
the
time
of
henry
ii
the
german
monarch
began
to
entitle
himself
rex
now
it
was
not
uncommon
in
the
middle
ages
for
the
to
a
throne
to
be
crowned
during
his
father
lifetime
that
at
the
death
of
the
latter
he
might
step
at
once
into
his
place
coronation
it
must
be
remembered
which
is
now
merely
a
spectacle
was
in
those
days
not
only
a
sort
of
sacrament
but
a
matter
of
great
political
importance
this
plan
was
specially
useful
in
an
elective
monarchy
such
as
germany
was
after
the
twelfth
century
for
it
avoided
the
delays
and
dangers
of
an
election
while
the
throne
was
vacant
but
as
it
seemed
against
the
order
of
nature
to
have
two
emperors
at
once
and
as
the
sovereign
authority
in
germany
depended
not
on
the
roman
but
on
the
german
coronation
the
practice
came
to
be
that
each
emperor
during
his
own
life
procured
if
he
could
the
election
of
his
successor
who
was
crowned
at
aachen
in
later
times
at
frankfort
and
took
the
title
of
of
the
romans
during
the
presence
of
the
emperor
in
germany
he
exercised
no
more
authority
than
a
prince
of
wales
does
in
england
but
on
the
emperor
death
he
succeeded
at
once
without
any
second
election
or
coronation
and
assumed
after
the
time
of
ferdinand
i
the
title
of
elect
before
ferdinand
time
he
would
have
been
expected
to
go
to
rome
to
be
crowned
there
while
the
hapsburgs
held
the
sceptre
each
monarch
generally
contrived
in
this
way
to
have
his
son
or
some
other
near
relative
chosen
to
succeed
him
but
many
were
foiled
in
their
attempts
to
do
so
and
in
such
cases
an
election
was
held
after
the
death
according
to
the
rules
laid
down
in
the
golden
bull
the
first
person
who
thus
became
king
of
the
romans
in
the
lifetime
of
an
emperor
seems
to
have
been
henry
vi
son
of
frederick

it
was
in

of
this
title
that
napoleon

says
that
the

may

in

of

but
not
in

there
is
some
reason
to
think
that
towards
the
end
of
the
empire
people
had
begun
to
fancy
that
did
not
mean
but
cf
note
these
expressions
seem
to
have
been
intended
to
distinguish
the
kingdom
of
the
eastern
or
germanic
franks
from
that
of

western

being

it
is
right
to
remark
that
what
is
stated
here
can
be
taken
as
only
generally
and
probably
true
so
great
are
the
discrepancies
among
even
the
most
careful
writers
on
the
subject
and
so
numerous
the
forgeries
of
a
later
age
which
are
to
be
found
among
the
genuine
documents
of
the
early
empire
goldast
for
instance
are
full
of
forgeries
and
anachronisms
detailed
information
may
be
found
in
pfeffinger
moser
and
pütter
and
in
the
host
of
writers
to
whom
they
refer
we
in
england
may
be
thought
to
have
made
some
slight
movement
in
the
same
direction
by
calling
the
united
great
council
of
the
three
kingdoms
the
imperial
parliament
although
to
be
sure
the
burgundian
dominions
had
all
passed
from
the

to

the
