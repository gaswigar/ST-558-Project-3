preface
voltaire
lengthy
correspondences
do
not
contain
anything
that
might
indicate
the
period
in
which
was
published
the
engraved
title
of
the
edition
that
i
believe
to
be
the
original
displays
no

abbot
trublet
in
his
of
does
not
hesitate
to
say
that
is
directed
against
fontenelle
but
does
not
speak
of
the
date
of
publication
i
have
therefore
retained
that
given
by
the
kehl
editions
however
there
is
an
edition
carrying
the
date
of
is
this
date
authentic
i
would
not
make
this
claim
far
from
it
i
have
therefore
followed
the
kehl
editions
in
which
is
preceded
by
this
warning
this
novel
can
be
seen
as
an
imitation
of
gulliver
travels
it
contains
many
allusions
the
dwarf
of
saturn
is
fontenelle
despite
his
gentleness
his
carefulness
his
philosophy
all
of
which
should
endear
him
to
voltaire
he
is
linked
with
the
enemies
of
this
great
man
and
appears
to
share
if
not
in
their
hate
at
least
in
their
preemptive
censures
he
was
deeply
hurt
by
the
role
he
played
in
this
novel
and
perhaps
even
more
so
due
to
the
justness
though
severe
of
the
critique
the
strong
praise
given
elsewhere
in
the
novel
only
lends
more
weight
to
the
rebukes
the
words
that
end
this
work
do
not
soften
the
wounds
and
the
good
that
is
said
of
the
secretary
of
the
academy
of
paris
does
not
console
fontenelle
for
the
ridicule
that
is
permitted
to
befall
the

at
the

the

voyage
of
an
inhabitant
of
the
sirius
star
to
the
planet
saturn
on
one
of
the
planets
that
orbits
the
star
named
sirius
there
lived
a
spirited
young
man
who
i
had
the
honor
of
meeting
on
the
last
voyage
he
made
to
our
little
ant
hill
he
was
called
micromegas
a
fitting
name
for
anyone
so
great
he
was
eight
leagues
tall
or
geometric
paces
of
five
feet
each
from
small
and
from
large
b
certain
geometers
always
of
use
to
the
public
will
immediately
take
up
their
pens
and
will
find
that
since
micromegas
inhabitant
of
the
country
of
sirius
is
paces
tall
which
is
equivalent
to
feet
and
since
we
citizens
of
the
earth
are
hardly
five
feet
tall
and
our
sphere
leagues
around
they
will
find
i
say
that
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
the
sphere
that
produced
him
was
times
greater
in
circumference
than
our
little
earth
nothing
in
nature
is
simpler
or
more
orderly
the
sovereign
states
of
germany
or
italy
which
one
can
traverse
in
a
half
hour
compared
to
the
empires
of
turkey
moscow
or
china
are
only
feeble
reflections
of
the
prodigious
differences
that
nature
has
placed
in
all
beings
this
is
how
the
text
reads
in
the
first
editions
others
in
place
of
geometers
put
algebraists
b
his
excellency
size
being
as
great
as
i
have
said
all
our
sculptors
and
all
our
painters
will
agree
without
protest
that
his
belt
would
have
been
feet
around
which
gives
him
very
good
proportions
his
nose
taking
up
one
third
of
his
attractive
face
and
his
attractive
face
taking
up
one
seventh
of
his
attractive
body
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
nose
of
the
sirian
is
feet
plus
a
fraction
which
is
manifest
i
restore
this
sentence
in
accordance
with
the
first
editions
b
as
for
his
mind
it
is
one
of
the
most
cultivated
that
we
have
he
knows
many
things
he
invented
some
of
them
he
was
not
even
years
old
when
he
studied
as
is
customary
at
the
most
celebrated
colleges
of
his
planet
where
he
managed
to
figure
out
by
pure
willpower
more
than
of
euclid
propositions
that
makes
more
than
blaise
pascal
who
after
having
figured
out
while
screwing
around
according
to
his
sister
reports
later
became
a
fairly
mediocre
geometer
and
a
very
bad
metaphysician
towards
his
year
near
the
end
of
his
infancy
he
dissected
many
small
insects
no
more
than
feet
in
diameter
which
would
evade
ordinary
microscopes
he
wrote
a
very
curious
book
about
this
and
it
gave
him
some
income
the
mufti
of
his
country
an
extremely
ignorant
worrywart
found
some
suspicious
rash
disagreeable
and
heretical
propositions
in
the
book
smelled
heresy
and
pursued
it
vigorously
it
was
a
matter
of
finding
out
whether
the
substantial
form
of
the
fleas
of
sirius
were
of
the
same
nature
as
those
of
the
snails
micromegas
gave
a
spirited
defense
he
brought
in
some
women
to
testify
in
his
favor
the
trial
lasted
years
finally
the
mufti
had
the
book
condemned
by
jurisconsults
who
had
not
read
it
and
the
author
was
ordered
not
to
appear
in
court
for
years
in
place
of
the
most
celebrated
that
one
finds
in
the
first
edition
subsequent
editions
read
some
jesuit
b
pascal
became
a
very
great
geometer
not
in
the
same
class
as
those
that
contributed
to
the
progress
of
science
with
great
discoveries
like
descartes
newton
but
certainly
ranked
among
the
geometers
whose
works
display
a
genius
of
the
first
order
the
edition
that
i
believe
to
be
original
reads
rash
smelling
heresy
the
present
text
is
dated
b
voltaire
had
been
persecuted
by
the
theatin
boyer
for
having
stated
in
his
on
the
that
our
souls
develop
at
the
same
time
as
our
organs
just
like
the
souls
of
animals
he
was
thereby
dealt
the
minor
affliction
of
being
banished
from
a
court
that
consisted
of
nothing
but
harassment
and
pettiness
he
wrote
an
amusing
song
at
the
expense
of
the
mufti
which
the
latter
hardly
noticed
and
he
took
to
voyaging
from
planet
to
planet
in
order
to
develop
his
heart
and
mind
as
the
saying
goes
those
that
travel
only
by
stage
coach
or
sedan
will
probably
be
surprised
learn
of
the
carriage
of
this
vessel
for
we
on
our
little
pile
of
mud
can
only
conceive
of
that
to
which
we
are
accustomed
our
voyager
was
very
familiar
with
the
laws
of
gravity
and
with
all
the
other
attractive
and
repulsive
forces
he
utilized
them
so
well
that
whether
with
the
help
of
a
ray
of
sunlight
or
some
comet
he
jumped
from
globe
to
globe
like
a
bird
vaulting
itself
from
branch
to
branch
he
quickly
spanned
the
milky
way
and
i
am
obliged
to
report
that
he
never
saw
throughout
the
stars
it
is
made
up
of
the
beautiful
empyrean
sky
that
the
vicar
derham
boasts
of
having
seen
at
the
other
end
of
his
telescope
i
do
not
claim
that
derham
has
poor
eyesight
god
forbid
but
micromegas
was
on
site
which
makes
him
a
reliable
witness
and
i
do
not
want
to
contradict
anyone
micromegas
after
having
toured
around
arrived
at
the
planet
saturn
as
accustomed
as
he
was
to
seeing
new
things
he
could
not
upon
seeing
the
smallness
of
the
planet
and
its
inhabitants
stop
himself
from
smiling
with
the
superiority
that
occasionally
escapes
the
wisest
of
us
for
in
the
end
saturn
is
hardly
nine
times
bigger
than
earth
and
the
citizens
of
this
country
are
dwarfs
no
more
than
a
thousand
fathoms
tall
or
somewhere
around
there
he
and
his
men
poked
fun
at
them
at
first
like
italian
musicians
laughing
at
the
music
of
lully
when
he
comes
to
france
but
as
the
sirian
had
a
good
heart
he
understood
very
quickly
that
a
thinking
being
is
not
necessarily
ridiculous
just
because
he
is
only
feet
tall
he
got
to
know
the
saturnians
after
their
shock
wore
off
he
built
a
strong
friendship
with
the
secretary
of
the
academy
of
saturn
a
spirited
man
who
had
not
invented
anything
to
tell
the
truth
but
who
understood
the
inventions
of
others
very
well
and
who
wrote
some
passable
verses
and
carried
out
some
complicated
calculations
i
will
report
here
for
the
reader
satisfaction
a
singular
conversation
that
micromegas
had
with
the
secretary
one
day
see
my
note
page
b
this
note
in
zadig
says
this
line
is
mostly
written
at
the
expense
of
rollin
who
often
employs
these
expressions
in
his
on
voltaire
returns
to
it
often
see
in
the
present
volume
chapter
i
of
micromegas
and
in
volume
xxxiv
chapter
xi
of
man
of
forty
chapter
ix
of
white
and
volume
xi
the
second
verse
of
song
viii
of
young
b
english
savant
author
of
and
several
other
works
that
seek
to
prove
the
existence
of
god
through
detailing
the
wonders
of
nature
unfortunately
he
and
his
imitators
are
often
mistaken
in
their
explanation
of
these
wonders
they
rave
about
the
wisdom
that
is
revealed
in
a
phenomenon
but
one
soon
discovers
that
the
phenomenon
is
completely
different
than
they
supposed
so
it
is
only
their
own
fabrications
that
give
them
this
impression
of
wisdom
this
fault
common
to
all
works
of
its
type
discredited
them
one
knows
too
far
in
advance
that
the
author
will
end
up
admiring
whatever
he
has
chosen
to
discuss
chapter
ii
conversation
between
the
inhabitant
of
sirius
and
that
of
saturn
after
his
excellency
laid
himself
down
to
rest
the
secretary
approached
him
you
have
to
admit
said
micromegas
that
nature
is
extremely
varied
yes
said
the
saturnian
nature
is
like
a
flower
bed
wherein
the
flowers
ugh
said
the
other
leave
off
with
flower
beds
the
secretary
began
again
nature
is
like
an
assembly
of
blonde
and
girls
whose
jewels
what
am
i
supposed
to
do
with
your
girls
said
the
other
then
she
is
like
a
gallery
of
paintings
whose
features
certainly
not
said
the
voyager
i
say
again
that
nature
is
like
nature
why
bother
looking
for
comparisons
to
please
you
replied
the
secretary
i
do
not
want
to
be
pleased
answered
the
voyager
i
want
to
be
taught
tell
me
how
many
senses
the
men
of
your
planet
have
we
only
have
said
the
academic
and
we
always
complain
about
it
our
imagination
surpasses
our
needs
we
find
that
with
our
senses
our
ring
our
five
moons
we
are
too
restricted
and
in
spite
of
all
our
curiosity
and
the
fairly
large
number
of
passions
that
result
from
our
senses
we
have
plenty
of
time
to
get
bored
i
believe
it
said
micromegas
for
on
our
planet
we
have
almost
senses
and
yet
we
still
have
a
kind
of
vague
feeling
a
sort
of
worry
that
warns
us
that
there
are
even
more
perfect
beings
i
have
traveled
a
bit
and
i
have
seen
mortals
that
surpass
us
some
far
superior
but
i
have
not
seen
any
that
desire
only
what
they
truly
need
and
who
need
only
what
they
indulge
in
maybe
someday
i
will
happen
upon
a
country
that
lacks
nothing
but
so
far
no
one
has
given
me
any
word
of
a
place
like
that
the
saturnian
and
the
sirian
proceeded
to
wear
themselves
out
in
speculating
but
after
a
lot
of
very
ingenious
and
very
dubious
reasoning
it
was
necessary
to
return
to
the
facts
how
long
do
you
live
said
the
sirian
oh
for
a
very
short
time
replied
the
small
man
from
saturn
same
with
us
said
the
sirian
we
always
complain
about
it
it
must
be
a
universal
law
of
nature
alas
we
only
live
through
revolutions
around
the
sun
said
the
saturnian
this
translates
to
about
years
by
our
standards
you
can
see
yourself
that
this
is
to
die
almost
at
the
moment
one
is
born
our
existence
is
a
point
our
lifespan
an
instant
our
planet
an
atom
hardly
do
we
begin
to
learn
a
little
when
death
arrives
before
we
get
any
experience
as
for
me
i
do
not
dare
make
any
plans
i
see
myself
as
a
drop
of
water
in
an
immense
ocean
i
am
ashamed
most
of
all
before
you
of
how
ridiculously
i
figure
in
this
world
micromegas
replied
if
you
were
not
a
philosopher
i
would
fear
burdening
you
by
telling
you
that
our
lifespan
is
times
longer
than
yours
but
you
know
very
well
when
it
is
necessary
to
return
your
body
to
the
elements
and
reanimate
nature
in
another
form
which
we
call
death
when
this
moment
of
metamorphosis
comes
to
have
lived
an
eternity
or
to
have
lived
a
day
amounts
to
precisely
the
same
thing
i
have
been
to
countries
where
they
live
a
thousand
times
longer
than
we
do
and
they
also
die
but
people
everywhere
have
the
good
sense
to
know
their
role
and
to
thank
the
author
of
nature
he
has
scattered
across
this
universe
a
profusion
of
varieties
with
a
kind
of
admirable
uniformity
for
example
all
the
thinking
beings
are
different
and
all
resemble
one
another
in
the
gift
of
thought
and
desire
matter
is
extended
everywhere
but
has
different
properties
on
each
planet
how
many
diverse
properties
do
you
count
in
yours
if
you
mean
those
properties
said
the
saturnian
without
which
we
believe
that
the
planet
could
not
subsist
as
it
is
we
count
of
them
like
extension
impenetrability
mobility
gravity
divisibility
and
the
rest
apparently
replied
the
voyager
this
small
number
suffices
for
what
the
creator
had
in
store
for
your
dwelling
i
admire
his
wisdom
in
everything
i
see
differences
everywhere
but
also
proportion
your
planet
is
small
your
inhabitants
are
as
well
you
have
few
sensations
your
matter
has
few
properties
all
this
is
the
work
of
providence
what
color
is
your
sun
upon
examination
a
very
yellowish
white
said
the
saturnian
and
when
we
divide
one
of
its
rays
we
find
that
it
contains
seven
colors
our
sun
strains
at
red
said
the
sirian
and
we
have
primary
colors
there
is
no
one
sun
among
those
that
i
have
gotten
close
to
that
resembles
it
just
as
there
is
no
one
face
among
you
that
is
identical
to
the
others
after
numerous
questions
of
this
nature
he
learned
how
many
essentially
different
substances
are
found
on
saturn
he
learned
that
there
were
only
about
thirty
like
god
space
matter
the
beings
with
extension
that
sense
the
beings
with
extension
that
sense
and
think
the
thinking
beings
that
have
no
extension
those
that
are
penetrable
those
that
are
not
and
the
rest
the
sirian
whose
home
contained
and
who
had
discovered
of
them
in
his
voyages
prodigiously
surprised
the
philosopher
of
saturn
finally
after
having
told
each
other
a
little
of
what
they
knew
and
a
lot
of
what
they
did
not
know
after
having
reasoned
over
the
course
of
a
revolution
around
the
sun
they
resolved
to
go
on
a
small
philosophical
voyage
together
chapter
iii
voyage
of
the
two
inhabitants
of
sirius
and
saturn
our
two
philosophers
were
just
ready
to
take
off
into
atmosphere
with
a
very
nice
provision
of
mathematical
instrument
when
the
ruler
of
saturn
who
had
heard
news
of
the
departure
came
in
tears
to
remonstrate
she
was
a
pretty
petite
brunette
who
was
only
fathoms
tall
but
who
compensated

our
two
explorers
left
all
the
same
they
alighted
first
on
the
ring
which
they
found
to
be
fairly
flat
as
conjectured
by
an
illustrious
inhabitant
of
our
little
sphere
from
there
they
went
easily
from
moon
to
moon
a
comet
passed
by
the
last
they
flew
onto
it
with
their
servants
and
their
instruments
when
they
had
traveled
about
one
hundred
fifty
million
leagues
they
met
with
the
satellites
of
jupiter
they
stopped
at
jupiter
and
stayed
for
a
week
during
which
time
they
learned
some
very
wonderful
secrets
that
would
have
been
forthcoming
in
print
if
not
for
the
inquisition
which
found
some
of
the
propositions
to
be
a
little
harsh
but
i
have
read
the
manuscript
in
the
library
of
the
illustrious
archbishop
of
who
with
a
generosity
and
goodness
that
is
impossible
to
praise
allowed
me
to
see
his
books
i
promised
him
a
long
article
in
the
first
edition
of
moréri
and
i
will
not
forget
his
children
who
give
such
a
great
hope
of
perpetuating
the
race
of
their
illustrious
father
huygens
see
volume

page
b
but
let
us
now
return
to
our
travelers
upon
leaving
jupiter
they
traversed
a
space
of
around
one
hundred
million
leagues
and
approached
the
planet
mars
which
as
we
know
is
five
times
smaller
than
our
own
they
swung
by
two
moons
that
cater
to
this
planet
but
have
escaped
the
notice
of
our
astronomers
i
know
very
well
that
father
castel
will
write
perhaps
even
agreeably
enough
against
the
existence
of
these
two
moons
but
i
rely
on
those
who
reason
by
analogy
these
good
philosophers
know
how
unlikely
it
would
be
for
mars
so
far
from
the
sun
to
have
gotten
by
with
less
than
two
moons
whatever
the
case
may
be
our
explorers
found
it
so
small
that
they
feared
not
being
able
to
land
on
it
and
they
passed
it
by
like
two
travelers
disdainful
of
a
bad
village
cabaret
pressing
on
towards
a
neighboring
city
but
the
sirian
and
his
companion
soon
regretted
it
they
traveled
a
long
time
without
finding
anything
finally
they
perceived
a
small
candle
it
was
earth
this
was
a
pitiful
sight
to
those
who
had
just
left
jupiter
nevertheless
from
fear
of
further
regret
they
resolved
to
touch
down
carried
by
the
tail
of
a
comet
and
finding
an
aurora
borealis
at
the
ready
they
started
towards
it
and
arrived
at
earth
on
the
northern
coast
of
the
baltic
sea

chapter
iv
what
happened
on
planet
earth
after
resting
for
some
time
they
ate
two
mountains
for
lunch
which
their
crew
fixed
up
pretty
nicely
then
they
decided
to
get
to
know
the
small
country
they
were
in
they
went
first
from
north
to
south
the
usual
stride
of
the
sirian
and
his
crew
was
around
feet
the
dwarf
from
saturn
who
clocked
in
at
no
more
than
a
thousand
fathoms
trailed
behind
breathing
heavily
he
had
to
make
twelve
steps
each
time
the
other
took
a
stride
imagine
if
it
is
alright
to
make
such
a
comparison
a
very
small
lapdog
following
a
captain
of
the
guards
of
the
prussian
king
since
our
strangers
moved
fairly
rapidly
they
circumnavigated
the
globe
in
hours
the
sun
in
truth
or
rather
the
earth
makes
a
similar
voyage
in
a
day
but
you
have
to
imagine
that
the
going
is
much
easier
when
one
turns
on
one
axis
instead
of
walking
on
feet
so
there
they
were
back
where
they
started
after
having
seen
the
nearly
imperceptible
pond
we
call
and
the
other
little
pool
that
under
the
name
encircles
the
molehill
the
dwarf
never
got
in
over
his
knees
and
the
other
hardly
wet
his
heels
on
their
way
they
did
all
they
could
to
see
whether
the
planet
was
inhabited
or
not
they
crouched
laid
down
felt
around
everywhere
but
their
eyes
and
their
hands
were
not
proportionate
to
the
little
beings
that
crawl
here
they
could
not
feel
in
the
least
any
sensation
that
might
lead
them
to
suspect
that
we
and
our
associates
the
other
inhabitants
of
this
planet
have
the
honor
of
existing
the
dwarf
who
was
a
bit
hasty
sometimes
decided
straightaway
that
the
planet
was
uninhabited
his
first
reason
was
that
he
had
not
seen
anyone
micromegas
politely
indicated
that
this
logic
was
rather
flawed
for
said
he
you
do
not
see
with
your
little
eyes
certain
stars
of
the
magnitude
that
i
can
perceive
very
distinctly
do
you
conclude
that
these
stars
do
not
exist
but
said
the
dwarf
i
felt
around
a
lot
but
answered
the
other
you
have
pretty
weak
senses
but
replied
the
dwarf
this
planet
is
poorly
constructed
it
is
so
irregular
and
has
such
a
ridiculous
shape
everything
here
seems
to
be
in
chaos
you
see
these
little
rivulets
none
of
which
run
in
a
straight
line
these
pools
of
water
that
are
neither
round
nor
square
nor
oval
nor
regular
by
any
measure
all
these
little
pointy
specks
scattered
across
the
earth
that
grate
on
my
feet
this
was
in
reference
to
mountains
look
at
its
shape
again
how
it
is
flat
at
the
poles
how
it
clumsily
revolves
around
the
sun
in
a
way
that
necessarily
eliminates
the
climates
of
the
poles
to
tell
the
truth
what
really
makes
me
think
it
is
uninhabited
is
that
it
seems
that
no
one
of
good
sense
would
want
to
stay
well
said
micromegas
maybe
the
inhabitants
of
this
planet
are
not
of
good
sense
but
in
the
end
it
looks
like
this
may
be
for
a
reason
everything
appears
irregular
to
you
here
you
say
because
everything
on
saturn
and
jupiter
is
drawn
in
straight
lines
this
might
be
the
reason
that
you
are
a
bit
puzzled
here
have
i
not
told
you
that
i
have
continually
noticed
variety
in
my
travels
all
the
editions
that
precede
those
of
kehl
read
it
might
be
for
this
b
the
saturnian
responded
to
all
these
points
the
dispute
might
never
have
finished
if
it
were
not
for
micromegas
who
getting
worked
up
had
the
good
luck
to
break
the
thread
of
his
diamond
necklace
the
diamonds
fell
they
were
pretty
little
carats
of
fairly
irregular
size
of
which
the
largest
weighed
four
hundred
pounds
and
the
smallest
fifty
the
dwarf
recaptured
some
of
them
bending
down
for
a
better
look
he
perceived
that
these
diamonds
were
cut
with
the
help
of
an
excellent
microscope
so
he
took
out
a
small
microscope
of
feet
in
diameter
and
put
it
up
to
his
eye
and
micromegas
took
up
one
of
feet
in
diameter
they
were
excellent
but
neither
one
of
them
could
see
anything
right
away
and
had
to
adjust
them
finally
the
saturnian
saw
something
elusive
that
moved
in
the
shallow
waters
of
the
baltic
sea
it
was
a
whale
he
carefully
picked
it
up
with
his
little
finger
and
resting
it
on
the
nail
of
his
thumb
showed
it
to
the
sirian
who
began
laughing
for
a
second
time
at
the
ludicrously
small
scale
of
the
things
on
our
planet
the
saturnian
persuaded
that
our
world
was
inhabited
figured
very
quickly
that
it
was
inhabited
only
by
whales
and
as
he
was
very
good
at
reasoning
he
was
determined
to
infer
the
origin
and
evolution
of
such
a
small
atom
whether
it
had
ideas
a
will
liberty
micromegas
was
confused
he
examined
the
animal
very
patiently
and
found
no
reason
to
believe
that
a
soul
was
lodged
in
it
the
two
voyagers
were
therefore
inclined
to
believe
that
there
is
no
spirit
in
our
home
when
with
the
help
of
the
microscope
they
perceived
something
as
large
as
a
whale
floating
on
the
baltic
sea
we
know
that
a
flock
of
philosophers
was
at
this
time
returning
from
the
arctic
circle
where
they
had
made
some
observations
which
no
one
had
dared
make
up
to
then
the
gazettes
claimed
that
their
vessel
ran
aground
on
the
coast
of
bothnia
and
that
they
were
having
a
lot
of
difficulty
setting
things
straight
but
the
world
never
shows
its
cards
i
am
going
to
tell
how
it
really
happened
artlessly
and
without
bias
which
is
no
small
thing
for
an
historian
chapter
experiments
and
reasonings
of
the
two
voyagers
micromegas
slowly
reached
his
hand
towards
the
place
where
the
object
had
appeared
extended
two
fingers
and
withdrew
them
for
fear
of
being
mistaken
then
opened
and
closed
them
and
skillfully
seized
the
vessel
that
carried
these
fellows
putting
it
on
his
fingernail
without
pressing
it
too
hard
for
fear
of
crushing
it
here
is
a
very
different
animal
from
the
first
said
the
dwarf
from
saturn
the
sirian
put
the
animal
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
the
passengers
and
the
crew
who
believed
themselves
to
have
been
lifted
up
by
a
hurricane
and
who
thought
they
were
on
some
sort
of
boulder
scurried
around
the
sailors
took
the
barrels
of
wine
threw
them
overboard
onto
micromegas
hand
and
followed
after
the
geometers
took
their
quadrants
their
sextants
two
lappland
girls
and
descended
onto
the
sirian
fingers
they
made
so
much
fuss
that
he
finally
felt
something
move
tickling
his
fingers
it
was
a
baton
being
pressed
into
his
index
finger
he
judged
by
this
tickling
that
it
had
been
ejected
from
some
small
animal
that
he
was
holding
but
he
did
not
suspect
anything
else
at
first
the
microscope
which
could
barely
distinguish
a
whale
from
a
boat
could
not
capture
anything
as
elusive
as
a
man
i
do
not
claim
to
outrage
anyone
vanity
but
i
am
obliged
to
ask
that
important
men
make
an
observation
here
taking
the
size
of
a
man
to
be
about
five
feet
the
figure
we
strike
on
earth
is
like
that
struck
by
an
animal
of
about
six
hundred
thousandths
the
height
of
a
flea
on
a
ball
five
feet
around
imagine
something
that
can
hold
the
earth
in
its
hands
and
which
has
organs
in
proportion
to
ours
and
it
may
very
well
be
that
there
are
such
things
conceive
i
beg
of
you
what
these
things
would
think
of
the
battles
that
allow
a
vanquisher
to
take
a
village
only
to
lose
it
later
see
the
notes
to
the
speech
in
verse
on
moderation
volume
xii
and
those
of
russia
to
paris
volume
xiv
the
edition
that
i
take
to
be
original
reads
sixty
thousandths
i
do
not
doubt
that
if
ever
some
captain
of
some
troop
of
imposing
grenadiers
reads
this
work
he
will
increase
the
size
of
the
hats
of
his
troops
by
at
least
two
imposing
feet
but
i
warn
him
that
it
will
have
been
done
in
vain
that
he
and
his
will
never
grow
any
larger
than
infinitely
small
what
marvelous
skill
it
must
have
taken
for
our
philosopher
from
sirius
to
perceive
the
atoms
i
have
just
spoken
of
when
leuwenhoek
and
hartsoëker
tinkered
with
the
first
or
thought
they
saw
the
grains
that
make
us
up
they
did
not
by
any
means
make
such
an
astonishing
discovery
what
pleasure
micromegas
felt
at
seeing
these
little
machines
move
at
examining
all
their
scurrying
at
following
them
in
their
enterprises
how
he
cried
out
with
what
joy
he
placed
one
of
his
microscopes
in
the
hands
of
his
traveling
companion
i
see
them
they
said
at
the
same
time
look
how
they
are
carrying
loads
stooping
getting
up
again
they
spoke
like
that
hands
trembling
from
the
pleasure
of
seeing
such
new
objects
and
from
fear
of
losing
them
the
saturnian
passing
from
an
excess
of
incredulity
to
an
excess
of
credulity
thought
he
saw
them
mating
ah
he
said
i
have
caught
nature
in
the
act
but
he
was
fooled
by
appearances
which
happens
only
too
often
whether
one
is
using
a
microscope
or
not
pris

a
happy
turn
of
phrase
expressed
by
fontenelle
upon
making
some
observations
of
natural
history
chapter
vi
what
happened
to
them
among
men
micromegas
a
much
better
observer
than
his
dwarf
clearly
saw
that
the
atoms
were
speaking
to
each
other
and
pointed
this
out
to
his
companion
who
ashamed
of
being
mistaken
about
them
reproducing
did
not
want
to
believe
that
such
a
species
could
communicate
he
had
the
gift
of
language
as
well
as
the
sirian
he
could
not
hear
the
atoms
talk
and
he
supposed
that
they
did
not
speak
moreover
how
could
these
impossibly
small
beings
have
vocal
organs
and
what
would
they
have
to
say
to
speak
one
must
think
more
or
less
but
if
they
think
they
must
therefore
have
the
equivalent
of
a
soul
but
to
attribute
the
equivalent
of
a
soul
to
this
species
seemed
absurd
to
him
but
said
the
sirian
you
believed
right
away
that
they
made
love
do
you
believe
that
one
can
make
love
without
thinking
and
without
uttering
one
word
or
at
least
without
making
oneself
heard
do
you
suppose
as
well
that
it
is
more
difficult
to
produce
an
argument
than
an
infant
both
appear
to
be
great
mysteries
to
me
i
do
not
dare
believe
or
deny
it
said
the
dwarf
i
have
no
more
opinions
we
must
try
to
examine
these
insects
and
reason
after
that
is
very
well
said
echoed
micromegas
and
he
briskly
took
out
a
pair
of
scissors
with
which
he
cut
his
fingernails
and
from
the
parings
of
his
thumbnail
he
improvised
a
kind
of
like
a
vast
funnel
and
put
the
end
up
to
his
ear
the
circumference
of
the
funnel
enveloped
the
vessel
and
the
entire
crew
the
weakest
voice
entered
into
the
circular
fibers
of
the
nails
in
such
a
way
that
thanks
to
his
industriousness
the
philosopher
above
could
hear
the
drone
of
our
insects
below
perfectly
in
a
small
number
of
hours
he
was
able
to
distinguish
words
and
finally
to
understand
french
the
dwarf
managed
to
do
the
same
though
with
more
difficulty
the
voyagers
surprise
redoubled
each
second
they
heard
the
mites
speak
fairly
intelligently
this
performance
of
nature
seemed
inexplicable
to
them
you
may
well
believe
that
the
sirian
and
the
dwarf
burned
with
impatience
to
converse
with
the
atoms
the
dwarf
feared
that
his
thunderous
voice
and
assuredly
micromegas
would
deafen
the
mites
without
being
understood
they
had
to
diminish
its
force
they
placed
toothpicks
in
their
mouths
whose
tapered
ends
fell
around
the
ship
the
sirian
put
the
dwarf
on
his
knees
and
the
ship
with
its
crew
on
a
fingernail
he
lowered
his
head
and
spoke
softly
finally
relying
on
these
precautions
and
many
others
he
began
his
speech
like
so
invisible
insects
that
the
hand
of
the
creator
has
caused
to
spring
up
in
the
abyss
of
the
infinitely
small
i
thank
him
for
allowing
me
to
uncover
these
seemingly
impenetrable
secrets
perhaps
those
at
my
court
would
not
deign
to
give
you
audience
but
i
mistrust
no
one
and
i
offer
you
my
protection
if
anyone
has
ever
been
surprised
it
was
the
people
who
heard
these
words
they
could
not
figure
out
where
they
were
coming
from
the
chaplain
of
the
vessel
recited
the
exorcism
prayers
the
sailors
swore
and
the
philosophers
of
the
vessel
constructed
systems
but
no
matter
what
systems
they
came
up
with
they
could
not
figure
out
who
was
talking
the
dwarf
from
saturn
who
had
a
softer
voice
than
micromegas
told
them
in
a
few
words
what
species
they
were
dealing
with
he
told
them
about
the
voyage
from
saturn
brought
them
up
to
speed
on
what
micromegas
was
and
after
lamenting
how
small
they
were
asked
them
if
they
had
always
been
in
this
miserable
state
so
near
nothingness
what
they
were
doing
on
a
globe
that
appeared
to
belong
to
whales
whether
they
were
happy
if
they
reproduced
if
they
had
a
soul
and
a
hundred
other
questions
of
this
nature
a
reasoner
among
the
troop
more
daring
than
the
others
and
shocked
that
someone
might
doubt
his
soul
observed
the
interlocutor
with
pointed
at
a
quarter
circle
from
two
different
stations
and
at
the
third
spoke
thusly
you
believe
then
sir
that
because
you
are
a
thousand
fathoms
tall
from
head
to
toe
that
you
are
a
a
thousand
fathoms
cried
the
dwarf
good
heavens
how
could
he
know
my
height
a
thousand
fathoms
you
can
not
mistake
him
for
a
flea
this
atom
just
measured
me
he
is
a
surveyor
he
knows
my
size
and
i
who
can
only
see
him
through
a
microscope
i
still
do
not
know
his
yes
i
measured
you
said
the
physician
and
i
will
measure
your
large
companion
as
well
the
proposition
was
accepted
his
excellency
laid
down
flat
for
were
he
to
stay
upright
his
head
would
have
been
among
the
clouds
our
philosophers
planted
a
great
shaft
on
him
in
a
place
that
doctor
swift
would
have
named
but
that
i
will
restrain
myself
from
calling
by
its
name
out
of
respect
for
the
ladies
next
by
a
series
of
triangles
linked
together
they
concluded
that
what
they
saw
was
in
effect
a
young
man
of
feet
the
edition
i
believe
to
be
original
reads
a
beautiful
young
of
feet
b
so
micromegas
delivered
these
words
i
see
more
than
ever
that
one
must
not
judge
anything
by
its
apparent
size
oh
god
you
who
have
given
intelligence
to
substance
that
appears
contemptible
the
infinitely
small
costs
you
as
little
as
the
infinitely
large
and
if
it
is
possible
that
there
are
such
small
beings
as
these
there
may
just
as
well
be
a
spirit
bigger
than
those
of
the
superb
animals
that
i
have
seen
in
the
heavens
whose
feet
alone
would
cover
this
planet
one
of
the
philosophers
responded
that
he
could
certainly
imagine
that
there
are
intelligent
beings
much
smaller
than
man
he
recounted
not
every
fabulous
thing
virgil
says
about
bees
but
what
swammerdam
discovered
and
what
réaumur
has
anatomized
he
explained
finally
that
there
are
animals
that
are
to
bees
what
bees
are
to
man
what
the
sirian
himself
was
for
the
vast
animals
he
had
spoken
of
and
what
these
large
animals
are
to
other
substances
before
which
they
looked
like
atoms
little
by
little
the
conversation
became
interesting
and
micromegas
spoke
thusly
chapter
vii
conversation
with
the
men
oh
intelligent
atoms
in
which
the
eternal
being
desired
to
make
manifest
his
skill
and
his
power
you
must
no
doubt
taste
pure
joys
on
your
planet
for
having
so
little
matter
and
appearing
to
be
entirely
spirit
you
must
live
out
your
life
thinking
and
loving
the
veritable
life
of
the
mind
nowhere
have
i
seen
true
bliss
but
it
is
here
without
a
doubt
at
this
all
the
philosophers
shook
their
heads
and
one
of
them
more
frank
than
the
others
avowed
that
if
one
excepts
a
small
number
of
inhabitants
held
in
poor
regard
all
the
rest
are
an
assembly
of
mad
vicious
and
wretched
people
we
have
more
substance
than
is
necessary
he
said
to
do
evil
if
evil
comes
from
substance
and
too
much
spirit
if
evil
comes
from
spirit
did
you
know
for
example
that
as
i
am
speaking
with
you
there
are
madmen
of
our
species
wearing
hats
killing
other
animals
wearing
turbans
or
being
massacred
by
them
and
that
we
have
used
almost
surface
of
the
earth
for
this
purpose
since
time
immemorial
we
saw
at
the
end
of
chapter
iii
that
the
story
occurs
in
voltaire
is
referring
to
the
war
between
the
turks
and
the
russians
from
to
b
the
sirian
shuddered
and
asked
the
reason
for
these
horrible
quarrels
between
such
puny
animals
it
is
a
matter
said
the
philosopher
of
some
piles
of
mud
as
big
as
your
heel
it
is
not
that
any
of
these
millions
of
men
that
slit
each
other
throats
care
about
this
pile
of
mud
it
is
only
a
matter
of
determining
if
it
should
belong
to
a
certain
man
who
we
call
or
to
another
who
we
call
for
whatever
reason
neither
one
has
ever
seen
nor
will
ever
see
the
little
piece
of
earth
and
almost
none
of
these
animals
that
mutually
kill
themselves
have
ever
seen
the
animal
for
which
they
kill
crimea
which
all
the
same
was
not
reunited
with
russia
until
b
oh
cruel
fate
cried
the
sirian
with
indignation
who
could
conceive
of
this
excess
of
maniacal
rage
it
makes
me
want
to
take
three
steps
and
crush
this
whole
anthill
of
ridiculous
assassins
do
not
waste
your
time
someone
responded
they
are
working
towards
ruin
quickly
enough
know
that
after
ten
years
only
one
hundredth
of
these
scoundrels
will
be
here
know
that
even
if
they
have
not
drawn
swords
hunger
fatigue
or
intemperance
will
overtake
them
furthermore
it
is
not
they
that
should
be
punished
it
is
those
sedentary
barbarians
who
from
the
depths
of
their
offices
order
while
they
are
digesting
their
last
meal
the
massacre
of
a
million
men
and
who
subsequently
give
solemn
thanks
to
god
the
voyager
was
moved
with
pity
for
the
small
human
race
where
he
was
discovering
such
surprising
contrasts
since
you
are
amongst
the
small
number
of
wise
men
he
told
these
sirs
and
since
apparently
you
do
not
kill
anyone
for
money
tell
me
i
beg
of
you
what
occupies
your
time
we
dissect
flies
said
the
philosopher
we
measure
lines
we
gather
figures
we
agree
with
each
other
on
two
or
three
points
that
we
do
not
understand
it
suddenly
took
the
sirian
and
the
saturnian
fancy
to
question
these
thinking
atoms
to
learn
what
it
was
they
agreed
on
what
do
you
measure
said
the
saturnian
from
the
dog
star
to
the
great
star
of
the
gemini
they
responded
all
at
once
and
a
half
degrees
what
do
you
measure
from
here
to
the
moon
radii
of
the
earth
even
how
much
does
your
air
weigh
he
thought
he
had
caught
them
but
they
all
told
him
that
air
weighed
around
times
less
than
an
identical
volume
of
the
purest
water
and
times
less
than
a
gold
ducat
the
little
dwarf
from
saturn
surprised
at
their
responses
was
tempted
to
accuse
of
witchcraft
the
same
people
he
had
refused
a
soul
fifteen
minutes
earlier
the
edition
i
believe
to
be
original
reads
put
them
off
in
place
of
caught
them
finally
micromegas
said
to
them
since
you
know
what
is
exterior
to
you
so
well
you
must
know
what
is
interior
even
better
tell
me
what
your
soul
is
and
how
you
form
ideas
the
philosophers
spoke
all
at
once
as
before
but
they
were
of
different
views
the
oldest
cited
aristotle
another
pronounced
the
name
of
descartes
this
one
here
malebranche
another
leibnitz
another
locke
an
old
peripatetic
spoke
up
with
confidence
the
soul
is
an
entelechy
and
a
reason
gives
it
the
power
to
be
what
it
is
this
is
what
aristotle
expressly
declares
page
of
the
louvre
edition
he
cited
the
passage
here
is
the
passage
such
as
it
is
transcribed
in
the
edition
dated
tis
esi
kai
toû
toude
this
passage
of
aristotle
the
book
ii
chapter
ii
is
translated
thusly
by
casaubon
quaedam
perfectio
et
actus
ac
ratio
est
quod
potentiam
habet
ut
ejusmodi
b
i
do
not
understand
greek
very
well
said
the
giant
neither
do
i
said
the
philosophical
mite
why
then
the
sirian
retorted
are
you
citing
some
man
named
aristotle
in
the
greek
because
replied
the
savant
one
should
always
cite
what
one
does
not
understand
at
all
in
the
language
one
understands
the
least
the
cartesian
took
the
floor
and
said
the
soul
is
a
pure
spirit
that
has
received
in
the
belly
of
its
mother
all
metaphysical
ideas
and
which
leaving
that
place
is
obliged
to
go
to
school
and
to
learn
all
over
again
what
it
already
knew
and
will
not
know
again
it
is
not
worth
the
trouble
responded
the
animal
with
the
height
of
eight
leagues
for
your
soul
to
be
so
knowledgeable
in
its
mother
stomach
only
to
be
so
ignorant
when
you
have
hair
on
your
chin
but
what
do
you
understand
by
the
mind
you
are
asking
me
said
the
reasoner
i
have
no
idea
we
say
that
it
is
not
matter
but
do
you
at
least
know
what
matter
is
certainly
replied
the
man
for
example
this
stone
is
grey
has
such
and
such
a
form
has
three
dimensions
is
heavy
and
divisible
well
said
the
sirian
this
thing
that
appears
to
you
to
be
divisible
heavy
and
grey
will
you
tell
me
what
it
is
you
see
some
attributes
but
behind
those
are
you
familiar
with
that
no
said
the
so
you
do
not
know
what
matter
is
so
micromegas
addressing
another
sage
that
he
held
on
a
thumb
asked
what
his
soul
was
and
what
it
did
nothing
at
all
said
the
malebranchist
philosopher
god
does
everything
for
me
i
see
everything
in
him
i
do
everything
in
him
it
is
he
who
does
everything
that
i
get
mixed
up
in
see
the
opuscule
entitled
all
in
god
in
it
would
be
just
as
well
not
to
exist
retorted
the
sage
of
sirius
and
you
my
friend
he
said
to
a
leibnitzian
who
was
there
what
is
your
soul
it
is
answered
the
leibnitzian
the
hand
of
a
clock
that
tells
the
time
while
my
body
rings
out
or
if
you
like
it
is
my
soul
that
rings
out
while
my
body
tells
the
time
or
my
soul
is
the
mirror
of
the
universe
and
my
body
is
the
border
of
the
mirror
all
that
is
clear
a
small
partisan
of
locke
was
nearby
and
when
he
was
finally
given
the
floor
i
do
not
know
said
he
how
i
think
but
i
know
that
i
have
only
ever
thought
through
my
senses
that
there
are
immaterial
and
intelligent
substances
i
do
not
doubt
but
that
it
is
impossible
for
god
to
communicate
thought
to
matter
i
doubt
very
much
i
revere
the
eternal
power
it
is
not
my
place
to
limit
it
i
affirm
nothing
and
content
myself
with
believing
that
many
more
things
are
possible
than
one
would
think
the
animal
from
sirius
smiled
he
did
not
find
this
the
least
bit
sage
while
the
dwarf
from
saturn
would
have
kissed
the
sectarian
of
locke
were
it
not
for
the
extreme
disproportion
but
there
was
unfortunately
a
little
animalcule
in
a
square
hat
who
interrupted
all
the
other
animalcule
philosophers
he
said
that
he
knew
the
secret
that
everything
would
be
found
in
the
of
saint
thomas
he
looked
the
two
celestial
inhabitants
up
and
down
he
argued
that
their
people
their
worlds
their
suns
their
stars
had
all
been
made
uniquely
for
mankind
at
this
speech
our
two
voyagers
nearly
fell
over
with
that
inextinguishable
laughter
which
according
to
homer
is
shared
with
the
gods
their
shoulders
and
their
stomachs
heaved
up
and
down
and
in
these
convulsions
the
vessel
that
the
sirian
had
on
his
nail
fell
into
one
of
the
saturnian
trouser
pockets
these
two
good
men
searched
for
it
a
long
time
found
it
finally
and
tidied
it
up
neatly
the
sirian
resumed
his
discussion
with
the
little
mites
he
spoke
to
them
with
great
kindness
although
in
the
depths
of
his
heart
he
was
a
little
angry
that
the
infinitely
small
had
an
almost
infinitely
great
pride
he
promised
to
make
them
a
beautiful
philosophical
book
written
very
small
for
their
usage
and
said
that
in
this
book
they
would
see
the
point
of
everything
indeed
he
gave
them
this
book
before
leaving
it
was
taken
to
the
academy
of
science
in
paris
but
when
the
ancient
secretary
opened
it
he
saw
nothing
but
blank
pages
ah
he
said
i
suspected
as
much
illiad
i
b
the
edition
that
i
believe
to
be
original
and
the
one
dated
reads
philosophical
book
that
would
teach
them
of
admirable
things
and
show
them
the
goodness
of
things
although
this
scene
occurs
in
as
one
saw
in
pages
to
one
could
assign
the
epithet
of
old
to
fontenelle
who
was
at
that
point
and
who
died
years
later
in
he
resigned
from
his
position
as
perpetual
secretary

of
the
history
