no
recommendation
its
fame
has
been
long
since
established
and
its
fascination
has
already
held
sway
over
multitudes
of
delighted
readers
recognizing
fully
its
merits
the
publishers
of
this
edition
decided
to
put
it
in
the
way
of
a
still
greater
circulation
and
in
order
to
facilitate
this
it
has
been
thoroughly

adina
the
suppositious
writer
of
the
following
letters
is
the
daughter
of
a
jew
who
resides
in
alexandria
egypt
she
has
come
to
jerusalem
during
the
most
stirring
period
of
earth
history
and
from
thence
for
the
period
of
three
years
she
keeps
her
father
apprized
of
the
marvelous
events
occurring
about
her
during
that
time
the
publishers
letters
from
adina
letter
i
my
dear
father
my
first
duty
as
it
is
my
highest
pleasure
is
to
comply
with
your
command
to
write
you
as
soon
as
i
should
arrive
at
jerusalem
and
this
letter
while
it
conveys
intelligence
of
my
arrival
will
confirm
to
you
my
filial
obedience
my
journey
hither
occupied
many
days
when
we
traveled
in
sight
of
the
sea
which
we
did
for
three
days
i
enjoyed
the
majesty
of
the
prospect
it
seemed
so
like
the
sky
stretched
out
upon
the
earth
i
also
had
the
good
fortune
to
see
several
ships
which
the
rabbi
informed
me
were
roman
galleys
bound
some
to
sidon
and
others
into
the
nile
and
after
one
of
these
latter
as
it
was
going
to
you
i
sent
a
prayer
and
a
wish
just
as
we
were
leaving
the
to
turn
off
into
the
desert
i
saw
a
wrecked
vessel
it
looked
so
helpless
and
bulky
with
its
huge
black
body
all
out
of
the
water
that
it
seemed
to
me
like
a
great
stranded
and
dying
and
i
felt
like
pitying
it
how
terrible
a
tempest
must
be
upon
the
sea
i
was
in
hopes
to
have
seen
a
leviathan
but
was
not
gratified
in
the
wish
the
good
rabbi
who
seemed
to
know
all
about
these
things
told
me
that
they
seldom
appear
now
in
the
middle
sea
but
are
seen
beyond
the
pillar
of
hercules
at
the
world
end
at
gaza
we
stopped
two
days
and
from
thence
we
proceeded
to
our
destination
the
morning
of
the
last
day
of
our
journey
but
one
having
lost
our
way
and
wandered
many
hours
eastwardly
we
caught
sight
of
the
sea
of
sodom
and
gomorrah
at
a
great
distance
to
the
east
how
my
pulse
quickened
at
beholding
that
fearful
spot
i
seemed
to
see
in
imagination
the
heavens
on
fire
above
it
and
the
flames
and
smoke
ascending
as
from
a
great
furnace
as
on
that
fearful
day
when
they
were
destroyed
with
all
that
beautiful
surrounding
plain
which
we
are
told
was
one
vast
garden
of
beauty
how
calm
and
still
lay
now
that
sluggish
sea
beneath
a
cloudless
sky
we
held
it
in
sight
many
hours
and
once
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
jordan
north
of
it
looking
like
a
silver
thread
yet
near
as
it
appeared
to
be
i
was
told
it
was
a
good
day
journey
for
a
camel
to
reach
its
shores
after
losing
sight
of
this
melancholy
lake
our
way
lay
along
a
narrow
valley
for
some
time
and
the
next
day
on
reaching
an
eminence
jerusalem
appeared
as
if
risen
out
of
the
earth
i
can
not
my
dear
father
describe
to
you
my
emotions
on
beholding
the
holy
city
they
have
been
experienced
by
millions
of
our
people
they
were
similar
to
your
own
as
you
related
them
to
me
all
the
past
with
its
mighty
men
who
walked
with
jehovah
rushed
to
my
memory
and
compelled
me
to
bow
my
head
and
worship
and
adore
at
the
sight
of
the
temple
where
god
once
alas
why
does
he
no
longer
visit
earth
and
his
holy
house
dwelt
in
the
flaming
shechinah
and
made
known
the
oracles
of
his
will
we
entered
the
city
just
before
the
sixth
hour
of
the
evening
and
were
soon
at
the
house
of
our
relative
amos
the
levite
i
was
received
as
if
i
had
a
daughter
claim
to
their
embraces
and
with
the
luxuries
with
which
they
surrounded
me
in
my
gorgeously
furnished
apartments
i
am
sure
my
kinsfolk
here
mean
to
tempt
me
to
forget
the
joys
of
the
dear
home
i
have
left
the
rabbi
amos
and
his
family
all
desire
to
be
commended
to
you
he
seems
to
be
a
man
of
piety
and
benevolence
and
greatly
loves
his
children
i
have
been
once
to
the
temple
its
outer
court
seemed
like
a
vast
caravanserai
or
being
thronged
with
the
men
who
sell
animals
for
sacrifice
which
crowded
all
parts
thousands
of
doves
in
large
cages
were
sold
on
one
side
and
on
another
were
stalls
for
lambs
sheep
calves
and
oxen
the
noise
and
bleating
of
which
with
the
confusion
of
tongues
made
the
place
appear
like
anything
else
than
the
temple
of
jehovah
it
appears
like
desecration
to
use
the
temple
thus
dear
father
and
seems
to
show
a
want
of
that
holy
love
of
house
that
once
characterized
our
ancestors
on
reaching
the
court
i
was
sensible
of
being
in
the
temple
by
the
magnificence
which
surrounded
me
with
what
awe
i
bowed
my
head
in
the
direction
of
the
holy
of
holies
i
never
felt
before
so
near
to
god
clouds
of
incense
floated
above
the
heads
of
the
multitude
and
rivers
of
blood
flowed
down
the
marble
steps
of
the
altar
of
burnt
offering
alas
how
many
innocent
victims
bleed
every
morning
and
evening
for
the
sins
of
israel
what
a
sea
of
blood
has
been
poured
out
in
ages
that
have
passed
what
a
strange
fearful
mystery
that
the
blood
of
an
innocent
lamb
should
atone
for
sins
i
have
done
there
must
be
some
deeper
meaning
in
these
sacrifices
dear
father
yet
unrevealed
to
us
as
i
was
returning
from
the
temple
i
met
many
persons
who
seemed
to
be
crowding
out
of
the
gate
on
some
unusual
errand
i
have
since
learned
that
they
were
going
to
see
a
very
extraordinary
man
a
true
prophet
of
god
it
is
believed
by
many
who
dwells
in
the
wilderness
eastward
near
jordan
and
who
preaches
with
power
unknown
in
the
land
since
the
days
of
elijah
and
elisha
i
hope
he
is
a
true
prophet
of
heaven
and
that
god
is
once
more
about
to
remember
israel
but
the
days
of
the
prophets
have
long
passed
away
and
i
fear
this
man
is
only
an
enthusiast
farewell
dear
father
and
let
us
ever
pray
for
the
glory
of
israel
your
affectionate
adina
letter
ii
my
dear
father
the
street
in
which
we
dwell
is
elevated
and
from
the
roof
of
the
house
where
i
love
to
walk
in
the
evening
watching
the
stars
that
hang
over
egypt
there
is
commanded
a
wide
prospect
of
the
holy
city
yesterday
morning
i
was
early
on
the
to
behold
the
first
cloud
of
the
sacrifice
rise
from
the
bosom
of
the
temple
when
i
had
turned
my
gaze
towards
the
sacred
summit
i
was
awed
by
the
profound
silence
which
reigned
over
the
vast
pile
that
crowned
mount
moriah
the
sun
was
not
yet
risen
but
the
east
blushed
with
a
roseate
purple
and
the
morning
star
was
melting
into
its
depth
night
and
silence
still
held
united
empire
over
the
city
and
the
altar
of
god
i
was
i
stood
with
my
hands
crossed
upon
my
bosom
and
my
head
reverently
bowed
for
in
the
absence
of
man
and
his
voice
i
believed
angels
were
all
around
in
heavenly
hosts
the
guardian
armies
of
this
wondrous
city
of
david
lances
of
light
now
shot
upward
and
across
the
purple
sea
in
the
east
and
fleeces
of
clouds
that
reposed
upon
it
like
barks
catching
the
red
rays
of
the
yet
unrisen
sun
blazed
like
burning
ships
each
moment
the
darkness
fled
and
the
splendor
of
the
dawn
increased
and
when
i
expected
to
see
the
sun
appear
over
the
battlemented
heights
of
mount
moriah
i
was
thrilled
by
the
startling
peal
of
the
trumpets
of
the
priests
a
thousand
silver
trumpets
blown
at
once
from
the
walls
of
the
temple
and
shaking
the
very
foundations
of
the
city
with
their
mighty
voice
instantly
the
everywhere
around
were
alive
with
worshipers
jerusalem
started
as
one
man
from
its
slumbers
and
with
their
faces
towards
the
temple
a
hundred
thousand
men
of
israel
stood
waiting
a
second
trumpet
peal
clear
and
musical
as
the
voice
of
god
when
he
spake
to
our
father
moses
in
horeb
caused
every
knee
to
bend
and
every
tongue
to
join
in
the
morning
song
of
praise
the
murmur
of
voices
was
like
the
continuous
roll
of
the
surge
upon
the
beach
and
the
walls
of
the
lofty
temple
echoed
it
back
simultaneously
with
the
swell
of
the
adoring
hymn
i
beheld
a
pillar
of
black
smoke
ascend
from
the
midst
of
the
temple
and
spread
itself
above
the
court
like
a
canopy
it
was
accompanied
by
a
blue
wreath
of
lighter
and
more
misty
appearance
which
threaded
in
and
out
and
entwined
about
the
other
like
a
silvery
strand
woven
into
a
sable
cord
this
latter
was
the
smoke
of
the
incense
which
accompanied
the
burnt
sacrifice
as
i
saw
it
rise
higher
and
higher
and
finally
overtop
the
heavy
cloud
which
was
instantly
enlarged
by
volumes
of
dense
smoke
that
rolled
upward
from
the
consuming
victim
and
slowly
disappeared
melting
into
heaven
i
also
kneeled
remembering
that
on
the
wings
of
the
incense
went
up
the
prayers
of
the
people
and
ere
it
dissolved
wholly
i
entrusted
to
it
dear
father
prayers
for
thee
and
me
the
evening
sacrifice
is
if
possible
more
imposing
than
that
of
the
morning
just
as
the
sun
dips
beyond
the
hill
of
gibeah
there
is
heard
a
prolonged
note
of
a
trumpet
blown
from
one
of
the
western
of
zion
its
mellow
tones
reach
farthest
ear
within
the
gates
of
the
city
all
labor
at
once
ceases
every
man
raises
his
face
towards
the
summit
of
the
house
of
god
a
deep
pause
as
if
all
held
their
breath
in
expectation
succeeds
suddenly
the
very
skies
seem
to
be
riven
and
shaken
with
the
thunder
of
the
company
of
trumpeters
that
rolls
wave
on
wave
of
sound
from
the
battlements
of
the
temple
the
dark
cloud
of
sacrifice
ascends
in
solemn
grandeur
and
sometimes
heavier
than
the
evening
air
falls
like
a
descending
curtain
around
the
mount
till
the
whole
is
veiled
from
sight
but
above
it
is
seen
to
soar
the
purer
incense
to
the
invisible
jehovah
followed
by
a
myriad
eyes
and
the
utterance
of
a
nation
prayers
as
the
daylight
faded
the
light
of
the
altar
hidden
from
us
by
the
lofty
walls
of
the
outer
court
of
the
temple
blazed
high
and
and
lent
a
wild
solemnity
to
the
towers
and
pinnacles
that
crowned
moriah
illustration
panorama
of
jerusalem
there
was
however
my
dear
father
last
evening
one
thing
which
painfully
marred
the
holy
character
of
the
sacred
hour
after
the
blast
of
the
silver
trumpets
of
the
levites
had
ceased
and
while
all
hearts
and
eyes
were
ascending
to
jehovah
with
the
mounting
wreaths
of
incense
there
came
from
the
roman
castle
adjoining
the
city
of
david
a
loud
martial
clangor
of
brazen
bugles
and
other
barbarian
war
instruments
of
music
while
a
smoke
like
the
smoke
of
sacrifice
rose
from
the
heights
of
david
fortified
hill
i
was
told
that
it
was
the
romans
engaged
in
worshiping
jupiter
alas
how
truly
now
are
the
prophecies
fulfilled
which
are
to
be
found
in
the
lamentations
the
lord
hath
cast
off
his
altar
he
hath
given
up
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
the
walls
of
her
palaces
they
have
made
a
noise
in
the
house
of
the
lord
as
in
the
day
of
a
solemn
feast
for
these
things
i
weep
my
dear
father
nearly
three
hundred
years
have
passed
since
we
have
had
a
prophet
that
divine
and
youthful
malachi
since
his
day
rabbi
amos
confesses
that
jehovah
has
made
no
sign
of
having
heard
the
prayers
or
heeded
the
sacrifices
that
have
been
offered
to
him
in
his
time
i
inquired
of
the
intelligent
rabbi
if
it
would
always
be
thus
he
replied
that
when
shiloh
came
there
would
be
a
restoration
of
all
things
that
the
glory
of
jerusalem
then
would
fill
the
whole
earth
with
the
splendor
of
the
sun
and
that
all
nations
should
come
up
from
the
ends
of
the
world
to
worship
in
the
temple
my
conversation
with
rabbi
amos
dear
father
led
me
to
examine
the
book
of
the
prophet
malachi
i
find
that
after
plainly
alluding
to
our
present
shame
and
reproaching
the
priests
for
causing
the
people
to
stumble
he
thus
prophesies
behold
i
will
send
my
messenger
and
he
shall
prepare
the
way
before
me
and
the
lord
whom
ye
seek
shall
suddenly
come
to
his
temple
and
he
shall
sit
as
a
refiner
and
purifier
of
silver
and
he
shall
purify
the
sons
of
levi
and
purge
them
as
gold
and
silver
that
they
may
offer
unto
the
lord
an
offering
in
righteousness
behold
adds
the
divine
seer
i
will
send
you
elijah
the
prophet
before
the
coming
of
the
great
and
dreadful
day
of
the
lord
these
words
i
read
to
rabbi
amos
indeed
i
was
reading
them
when
rabbi
ben
israel
came
in
to
say
that
he
departs
the
excellent
amos
looked
grave
i
feared
i
had
offended
him
by
my
boldness
and
approaching
him
was
about
to
embrace
him
when
i
saw
tears
were
sparkling
in
his
eyes
he
took
my
hand
and
smiling
while
a
glittering
drop
danced
down
his
beard
and
broke
into
liquid
diamonds
upon
my
hand
he
said
you
have
done
no
wrong
child
sit
down
by
me
and
be
at
peace
with
thyself
it
is
too
true
in
this
day
what
the
prophet
malachi
writeth
o
ben
israel
he
said
sadly
to
the
alexandrian
rabbi
the
priests
of
the
temple
have
indeed
become
corrupt
save
a
few
here
and
there
it
must
have
been
at
this
day
the
prophet
aimed
his
words
save
in
the
outward
form
i
fear
the
great
body
of
our
levites
have
little
more
true
religion
and
just
knowledge
of
the
one
god
jehovah
than
the
priests
of
the
roman
idolatry
alas
i
fear
me
god
regards
our
sacrifices
with
no
more
favor
than
he
looks
upon
theirs
while
i
was
in
the
temple
and
was
serving
at
the
altar
with
the
priests
these
words
of
isaiah
came
into
my
thoughts
and
would
not
be
put
aside
what
purpose
is
the
multitude
of
your
sacrifices
unto
me
saith
the
lord
i
am
full
of
the
burnt
offerings
of
rams
and
the
fat
of
fed
beasts
and
i
delight
not
in
the
blood
of
bullocks
or
of
lambs
or
of
bring
no
more
vain
oblations
incense
is
an
abomination
unto
me
i
am
weary
to
bear
them
yea
when
ye
spread
forth
your
hands
i
will
hide
mine
eyes
from
you
yea
when
ye
make
many
prayers
i
will
not
hear
your
hands
are
full
of
blood
wash
you
make
you
clean
cease
to
do
evil
learn
to
do
well
i
have
noticed
said
ben
israel
that
there
is
less
reverence
now
in
the
temple
than
when
i
was
in
jerusalem
a
young
man
but
i
find
that
the
magnificence
of
the
ceremonies
is
increased
yes
responded
rabbi
amos
with
a
look
of
sorrow
yes
as
the
soul
of
piety
dies
out
from
within
they
gild
the
outside
the
increased
richness
of
the
worship
is
copied
from
the
romans
so
low
are
we
fallen
our
worship
with
all
its
gorgeousness
is
as
a
sepulchre
to
conceal
the
rottenness
within
you
may
be
convinced
my
dear
father
that
this
confession
from
such
a
source
deeply
humbled
me
if
then
we
are
not
worshiping
god
what
do
we
worship
naught
we
are
worse
off
than
our
barbarian
conquerors
for
we
have
no
god
while
they
at
least
have
gods
many
and
lords
many
such
as
they
are
since
writing
the
last
line
i
have
been
interrupted
by
mary
who
has
brought
to
see
me
a
youth
nephew
of
a
noble
jewish
ruler
who
was
slain
by
the
romans
for
his
patriotic
devotion
to
his
country
he
dwells
near
the
gaza
gate
with
his
widowed
mother
who
is
a
noble
lady
honored
by
all
between
this
young
man
whose
name
is
john
and
mary
there
exists
a
beautiful
attachment
which
is
each
day
ripening
into
the
deepest
emotion
he
has
just
returned
from
the
vicinity
of
jericho
where
he
has
been
for
some
days
past
drawn
thither
by
curiosity
to
see
and
hear
the
new
prophet
who
is
drawing
thousands
into
the
wilderness
to
listen
to
the
eloquence
that
flows
from
his
mouth
the
young
man
had
been
giving
mary
so
interesting
an
account
of
him
that
she
desired
me
also
to
be
a
listener
in
my
next
i
will
write
you
all
i
heard
your
affectionate
and
devoted
daughter
adina
letter
iii
my
dear
father
this
morning
as
i
was
coming
from
the
temple
i
noticed
a
vast
pile
of
edifices
crowning
the
opposite
rock
which
i
was
told
was
the
tower
of
antonia
it
seemed
to
frown
sternly
upon
the
temple
and
upon
its
battlements
glittered
at
intervals
numerous
roman
eagles
i
had
so
often
heard
you
relate
historical
events
connected
with
this
celebrated
castle
that
i
regarded
it
with
peculiar
interest
you
seemed
to
stand
by
my
side
as
i
gazed
upon
it
the
insolence
and
power
of
the
roman
garrison
have
made
the
beautiful
walk
about
the
base
of
the
tower
almost
deserted
but
of
this
i
was
not
aware
and
attended
only
by
my
ethiopian
slave
onia
i
lingered
to
admire
the
splendor
of
the
cloister
once
surrounding
the
of
the
temple
with
its
terraces
supported
by
white
marble
pillars
fifteen
cubits
high
when
two
roman
soldiers
approached
it
was
then
that
i
saw
i
was
alone
i
drew
my
veil
closely
and
would
have
passed
them
rapidly
when
one
of
them
placed
himself
in
my
path
and
catching
hold
of
my
veil
tried
to
detain
me
i
left
it
in
his
grasp
and
was
flying
when
the
other
soldier
arrested
me
this
was
in
full
view
of
the
castle
and
at
my
shrieks
the
barbarians
in
the
castle
laughed
aloud
at
this
crisis
appeared
a
young
centurion
who
was
on
horseback
coming
down
the
rocky
path
that
ascends
the
rock
of
zion
and
shouting
to
them
he
galloped
forward
and
with
his
sword
put
the
men
to
immediate
flight
and
rescued
me
in
order
to
escort
me
safely
to
the
streets
below
he
alighted
from
his
horse
and
leading
him
by
the
rein
walked
by
my
side
i
confess
to
you
dear
father
i
had
not
reached
the
house
of
my
relative
before
my
prejudices
against
the
romans
were
greatly
modified
i
had
found
in
one
of
them
as
courteous
a
person
as
i
had
ever
met
with
among
my
own
countrymen
and
for
his
sake
i
was
willing
to
think
better
of
his
barbaric
land
and
people
illustration
tower
of
antonia
while
i
was
writing
the
above
a
commotion
without
drew
me
to
the
lattice
which
overlooks
the
street
that
goes
out
of
the
gate
to
bethany
one
of
the
most
frequented
thoroughfares
in
the
city
the
sight
that
met
my
eyes
was
truly
imposing
but
made
my
heart
sink
with
shame
it
was
a
pageant
with
banners
eagles
trumpets
and
gilded
chariots
but
not
the
pageant
of
a
king
of
israel
like
those
which
dazzled
the
streets
of
jerusalem
in
the
days
of
solomon
and
king
david
not
the
triumphant
passage
of
an
israelitish
prince
but
of
the
roman
governor
preceded
by
a
cohort
of
horse
he
rode
in
a
gilded
lolling
at
his
ease
beneath
a
silken
shade
of
blue
silk
fringed
with
gold
the
horses
were
and
covered
with
silver
mail
and
adorned
with
plumes
he
was
followed
by
another
body
of
cavalry
and
at
the
head
of
them
looking
more
like
a
ruler
and
prince
than
did
the
indolent
pilate
i
beheld
the
generous
centurion
who
had
aided
my
escape
from
the
two
soldiers
his
eye
sought
the
lattice
at
which
i
stood
and
i
drew
back
but
not
before
he
had
seen
me
and
saluted
me
certainly
father
this
youth
is
noble
and
courteous
enough
to
be
a
jew
and
should
any
providence
cause
us
to
meet
again
i
shall
try
to
convert
him
from
his
idolatry
to
serve
the
living
jehovah
you
will
remember
dear
father
that
i
alluded
to
an
excitement
that
is
increasing
every
day
in
reference
to
a
new
prophet
who
is
preaching
in
the
wilderness
of
jericho
for
three
weeks
past
several
parties
of
citizens
have
been
to
the
valley
of
jordan
to
see
and
hear
him
and
have
so
far
been
carried
away
by
him
as
to
have
been
baptized
of
him
in
jordan
confessing
their
sins
among
them
is
john
the
cousin
and
betrothed
of
mary
upon
his
return
we
saw
that
his
countenance
was
animated
beyond
its
wont
for
he
is
usually
of
a
sad
and
gentle
aspect
and
that
his
fine
eyes
beamed
with
an
ardent
hope
that
seemed
to
his
soul
he
thus
recounted
to
us
his
visit
to
the
prophet
of
jordan
after
leaving
the
gate
of
the
city
i
soon
reached
the
pretty
town
of
bethpage
where
at
the
inn
i
beheld
several
horsemen
just
mounting
to
go
in
the
direction
of
jericho
on
joining
the
cavalcade
i
learned
they
were
for
the
most
part
drawn
out
of
jerusalem
on
the
same
errand
with
myself
one
of
them
a
wealthy
young
noble
of
arimathea
was
actuated
by
the
same
holy
desire
that
burned
in
my
bosom
a
desire
that
we
might
in
the
prophet
who
was
called
john
discover
a
man
sent
from
god
the
others
were
bent
on
commerce
on
pleasure
or
mere
idle
curiosity
as
joseph
of
arimathea
and
i
rode
together
we
conversed
about
the
man
we
expected
to
see
my
companion
seemed
to
believe
that
he
was
a
true
prophet
for
being
very
well
read
in
the
scriptures
he
said
that
the
seventy
weeks
of
daniel
were
now
about
completed
when
the
messiah
was
to
come
i
then
asked
him
if
he
believed
that
the
messiah
who
was
to
be
a
and
king
and
have
dominion
from
the
sea
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
would
come
in
the
wilderness
clad
in
the
skin
of
wild
beasts
to
this
he
replied
that
he
could
not
regard
this
prophet
as
the
messiah
for
when
the
christ
should
come
he
was
to
come
to
the
temple
and
that
we
should
doubtless
first
see
him
there
but
that
he
was
greatly
in
hopes
that
the
prophet
we
were
going
to
see
would
prove
to
be
the
forerunner
foretold
by
malachi
who
heard
him
said
joseph
as
we
rode
into
the
village
of
bethany
that
he
publicly
proclaims
himself
the
forerunner
of
the
messiah
the
opinion
of
the
more
ignorant
who
have
listened
to
him
is
that
it
is
elijah
himself
returned
to
the
earth
others
assert
that
it
is
enoch
come
down
from
heaven
and
not
a
few
believe
him
to
be
isaiah
at
this
point
of
the
narrative
of
the
cousin
of
mary
dear
father
i
will
close
this
letter
in
my
next
i
will
resume
his
narrative
for
when
i
have
given
it
to
you
wholly
i
have
many
things
to
ask
you
to
which
it
gives
rise
in
my
mind
may
the
blessing
of
the
god
of
israel
be
upon
thee
my
dearest
father
adina
letter
iv
my
dear
father
i
have
had
the
pleasure
not
only
of
hearing
from
you
but
of
being
assured
of
your
continued
welfare
the
messages
of
parental
affection
contained
in
your
letter
are
cherished
in
my
heart
you
need
not
fear
my
dear
father
that
i
shall
be
carried
away
from
the
faith
of
israel
by
any
strange
doctrines
i
will
take
counsel
by
your
wisdom
and
be
cautious
how
i
venture
in
my
inquiries
upon
sacred
ground
in
my
last
letter
i
commenced
giving
you
the
narrative
of
john
with
which
i
shall
now
proceed
having
passed
out
of
the
city
of
jericho
my
friend
of
arimathea
and
myself
crossed
the
plain
toward
jordan
the
morning
was
balmy
the
sun
made
all
nature
glad
the
dew
reflected
a
myriad
lesser
suns
and
the
earth
appeared
strewn
with
diamonds
for
a
little
way
the
road
lay
between
fields
of
corn
and
gardens
but
soon
it
crossed
the
open
plain
on
which
were
droves
of
wild
asses
which
lifted
their
small
spirited
heads
on
our
approach
eyed
us
with
timid
curiosity
and
then
bounded
off
to
the
wilderness
southward
with
the
speed
of
antelopes
as
the
great
body
of
the
people
took
their
way
obliquely
across
the
plain
we
knew
the
prophet
must
be
in
that
direction
we
at
length
found
him
on
the
banks
of
jordan
below
the
landing
and
ford
which
is
opposite
jericho
on
the
great
caravan
road
to
balbec
we
drew
near
a
dark
mass
of
human
beings
which
we
had
beheld
afar
off
assembled
around
a
small
eminence
near
the
river
upon
it
raised
a
few
cubits
taller
than
their
heads
stood
a
man
upon
whom
all
eyes
were
fixed
and
to
whose
words
every
ear
was
attentive
his
clear
rich
earnest
tones
had
reached
us
as
we
approached
before
we
could
distinguish
what
he
said
he
was
a
young
man
not
above
thirty
with
a
countenance
such
as
the
medallions
of
egypt
give
to
joseph
of
our
nation
once
their
prince
his
hair
was
long
and
wildly
free
about
his
neck
he
wore
a
loose
sack
of
camel
hair
and
his
right
arm
was
naked
to
the
shoulder
his
attitude
was
as
free
and
commanding
as
that
of
a
caucasian
warrior
yet
every
gesture
was
gentle
and
graceful
with
all
his
ringing
and
persuasive
eloquence
there
was
an
air
of
the
deepest
humility
upon
his
countenance
combined
with
an
expression
of
the
holiest
enthusiasm
his
theme
was
the
messiah
israel
return
unto
the
lord
thy
god
for
thou
hast
fallen
by
thine
iniquity
he
was
saying
as
we
came
up
as
if
in
continuation
of
what
had
gone
before
with
you
words
and
turn
unto
the
lord
and
say
unto
him
take
away
all
iniquity
and
receive
us
graciously
behold
he
cometh
who
will
heal
your
backsliding
and
will
love
you
freely
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
whosoever
shall
call
on
the
name
of
the
lord
shall
be
delivered
for
beside
him
there
is
no
savior
whom
speaketh
the
prophet
these
things
asked
one
who
stood
near
me
messiah
listen
answered
him
a
scribe
near
as
if
not
pleased
to
have
his
attention
interrupted
by
this
side
talk
words
are
plain
hear
him
ye
the
trumpet
in
zion
for
the
day
of
the
lord
cometh
continued
the
prophet
in
a
voice
like
that
of
a
silver
trumpet
behold
the
day
is
at
hand
when
i
will
bring
again
the
captivity
of
judah
put
ye
in
the
sickle
for
the
harvest
is
ripe
the
day
is
at
hand
when
the
lord
shall
roar
out
of
zion
and
utter
his
voice
from
jerusalem
thou
not
elias
asked
one
aloud
am
he
of
whom
it
is
written
the
voice
of
one
crying
in
the
wilderness
make
straight
a
highway
for
our
god
the
day
of
the
lord
is
at
hand
i
am
but
the
herald
who
is
sent
before
to
prepare
the
way
of
the
lord
thou
not
the
messiah
asked
a
woman
who
stood
near
him
and
seemed
to
worship
his
very
lips
who
cometh
after
me
is
mightier
than
i
whose
shoes
i
am
not
worthy
to
bear
he
responded
in
an
exultant
tone
strangely
at
variance
with
his
words
repent
ye
repent
ye
take
words
and
return
unto
the
lord
our
god
repent
and
be
baptized
for
the
remission
of
your
sins
then
he
added
turning
to
some
of
the
priests
even
now
is
the
axe
laid
unto
the
root
of
the
trees
every
tree
therefore
that
bringeth
not
forth
good
fruit
is
hewn
down
and
cast
into
the
fire
said
a
levite
thou
speak
these
things
to
us
who
are
of
israel
or
to
these
gentiles
and
samaritans
for
there
were
not
a
few
roman
soldiers
among
the
multitude
drawn
hither
by
curiosity
and
also
many
people
from
samaria
and
cry
in
the
ears
of
jerusalem
saith
the
lord
for
my
people
have
committed
two
evils
they
have
forsaken
me
the
fountain
of
living
waters
and
hewn
them
out
cisterns
broken
cisterns
that
can
hold
no
water
and
yet
thou
sayest
o
israel
thou
hast
not
sinned
thine
own
wickedness
shall
correct
thee
and
thy
backsliding
shall
reprove
thee
repent
and
do
works
meet
for
repentance
every
one
of
you
for
ye
have
polluted
the
land
neither
say
where
is
the
lord
that
brought
us
up
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
trust
not
to
lying
words
saying
the
temple
of
the
lord
the
temple
of
the
lord
the
temple
of
the
lord
ye
have
made
it
a
den
of
robbers
your
sacrifices
therein
are
become
an
abomination
would
touch
us
who
are
priests
master
said
a
priest
with
a
crimson
brow
are
not
robbers
saith
the
lord
answered
the
youthful
prophet
as
if
it
were
god
himself
speaking
from
horeb
so
that
we
trembled
be
unto
the
pastors
that
destroy
my
sheep
how
is
the
gold
become
dim
how
is
the
most
fine
gold
changed
the
precious
sons
of
zion
comparable
to
fine
gold
how
are
they
esteemed
woe
unto
you
ye
priests
for
ye
have
transgressed
my
people
have
transgressed
for
lack
of
knowledge
therefore
doth
the
land
mourn
and
every
one
that
dwelleth
therein
languisheth
therefore
do
swearing
and
lying
and
killing
and
stealing
and
committing
adultery
break
out
in
the
land
because
there
is
no
truth
nor
mercy
nor
knowledge
of
god
in
the
land
woe
unto
you
ye
priests
many
of
the
levites
then
turned
and
left
him
and
went
away
greatly
murmuring
and
they
would
gladly
have
done
the
prophet
a
mischief
but
they
feared
the
multitude
who
said
he
had
spoken
only
the
truth
of
them
the
elders
of
israel
who
are
not
priests
who
spring
from
abraham
shall
be
saved
by
abraham
master
asserted
or
rather
inquired
a
rich
ruler
of
our
city
after
the
tumult
caused
by
the
withdrawal
of
the
levites
had
a
little
subsided
the
youthful
prophet
rested
his
dark
eyes
like
two
suns
upon
the
old
man
face
and
said
impressively
not
to
say
within
yourself
we
have
abraham
to
our
father
for
i
say
unto
you
he
added
pointing
to
the
pebbles
at
his
feet
god
is
able
of
these
stones
to
raise
up
children
unto
abraham
he
is
of
abraham
who
doth
righteousness
therefore
repent
and
bring
forth
fruits
meet
for
repentance
here
was
heard
some
murmuring
among
a
group
of
many
pharisees
and
sadducees
at
these
words
when
sending
his
lightning
glance
towards
them
as
if
he
could
read
their
very
hearts
he
cried
generation
of
vipers
who
hath
warned
you
to
flee
from
the
wrath
to
come
the
day
cometh
when
he
who
is
to
come
shall
sit
as
a
purifier
by
his
furnace
bring
forth
therefore
fruits
meet
for
repentance
turn
thy
heart
from
wickedness
that
thou
mayest
be
saved
repent
ye
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
at
hand
o
israel
am
i
a
god
at
hand
and
not
a
god
afar
off
saith
the
lord
hear
ye
the
message
of
the
most
high
for
the
day
hath
come
when
jehovah
shall
once
more
visit
the
earth
and
talk
face
to
face
with
his
creatures
behold
the
day
hath
come
saith
the
lord
that
i
will
raise
unto
david
a
righteous
branch
and
a
king
to
reign
and
prosper
who
shall
execute
judgment
and
justice
on
the
earth
the
day
hath
come
saith
the
lord
in
which
judah
shall
be
saved
and
israel
shall
dwell
safely
when
i
will
set
up
shepherds
over
them
which
shall
feed
them
and
they
shall
lack
nothing
shine
for
thy
light
is
come
and
the
glory
of
the
lord
is
risen
upon
thee
darkness
covereth
the
earth
and
gross
darkness
the
people
as
saith
esaias
but
the
lord
shall
rise
upon
thee
and
his
glory
shall
be
seen
upon
thee
the
gentiles
shall
come
to
his
light
and
kings
to
the
brightness
of
his
rising
he
shall
be
called
the
lord
of
our
righteousness
and
shall
be
a
crown
of
glory
in
the
hand
of
the
lord
and
a
royal
diadem
in
the
hand
of
thy
god
the
spirit
of
the
lord
is
upon
me
to
proclaim
the
acceptable
year
of
his
coming
he
hath
set
me
a
watchman
upon
thy
walls
o
israel
and
i
may
neither
hold
my
peace
day
nor
night
nor
keep
silence
nor
seek
rest
till
he
come
who
hath
sent
me
forth
his
messenger
before
his
face
how
can
i
refrain
from
my
message
of
joy
how
shall
i
not
speak
of
his
fame
incline
your
ear
and
come
unto
him
hear
and
your
soul
shall
live
unto
the
lord
a
new
song
and
his
praise
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
for
thus
saith
god
the
lord
i
have
put
my
spirit
upon
him
a
bruised
reed
shall
he
not
break
and
the
smoking
flax
shall
he
not
quench
i
the
lord
saith
jehovah
addressing
the
only
begotten
i
have
called
thee
in
righteousness
and
will
hold
thy
hand
and
keep
thee
and
will
give
thee
for
a
covenant
of
the
people
for
a
light
of
the
gentiles
to
open
the
blind
eyes
to
bring
out
the
prisoners
from
the
prison
i
have
made
him
my
higher
than
the
kings
of
the
earth
look
unto
him
and
be
ye
saved
all
the
ends
of
the
earth
the
lord
of
hosts
is
his
name
the
holy
one
of
israel
all
this
was
spoken
with
an
enthusiasm
and
fire
that
made
every
pulse
bound
such
said
john
was
the
extraordinary
style
of
this
mighty
prophet
preaching
i
fancied
i
had
only
to
look
around
to
behold
the
messiah
the
immense
multitude
stood
awed
and
silent
when
he
had
ceased
leaving
the
eminence
he
said
and
i
thought
he
fixed
his
eyes
upon
me
who
desire
to
be
baptized
for
the
remission
of
sins
that
your
hearts
may
be
cleansed
for
the
visitation
of
this
holy
one
of
god
follow
me
to
the
river
side
thousands
obeyed
and
i
one
of
the
first
i
trembled
all
over
with
a
sweet
pleasure
when
he
took
me
by
the
hand
and
asked
me
if
i
believed
in
him
who
was
to
come
and
would
prepare
the
way
for
his
abode
in
my
heart
by
being
baptized
which
rite
also
was
to
be
a
sign
and
pledge
that
when
i
should
behold
the
shiloh
rising
i
should
acknowledge
him
not
less
than
one
thousand
were
baptized
by
him
that
day
in
jordan
confessing
their
sins
and
hopes
of
pardon
through
the
name
of
the
unknown
one
who
was
soon
to
come
after
the
baptism
the
whole
company
dispersed
in
groups
and
the
prophet
returned
into
the
wilderness
till
the
cool
of
the
evening
where
his
repast
was
locusts
and
the
wild
honey
of
the
desert
with
this
dear
father
i
close
my
long
letter
i
make
no
comments
i
will
only
say
that
my
expectations
are
actively
awake
and
that
i
am
looking
with
thousands
of
others
for
the
near
advent
of
the
messiah
your
daughter
adina
letter
my
dear
father
after
the
prophet
had
ended
his
second
discourse
and
baptized
full
two
hundred
more
in
the
sparkling
waters
of
jordan
resumed
the
eloquent
cousin
of
mary
he
sent
them
away
to
the
city
to
lodge
and
buy
meat
for
few
in
their
eagerness
to
hear
him
had
brought
provisions
with
them
many
before
leaving
him
drew
near
to
receive
his
blessing
of
love
and
it
was
touching
to
see
venerable
men
with
locks
shining
like
silver
and
leaning
upon
the
staff
bend
their
aged
heads
before
the
youthful
elias
as
if
in
acknowledgment
of
his
divine
commission
mothers
also
brought
their
infants
that
he
might
bless
them
and
youths
and
maidens
knelt
reverently
at
his
feet
in
tears
of
love
and
penitence
calmly
he
stood
upon
the
green
shores
like
an
angel
alighted
upon
earth
and
blessed
them
in
words
all
new
to
our
ears
but
which
thrilled
to
our
hearts
with
some
secret
power
that
agitated
us
with
trembling
joy
the
name
of
the
lamb
of
god
i
bless
thee
can
be
the
meaning
of
these
words
asked
mary
with
her
gentle
earnestness
her
betrothed
could
only
reply
that
he
knew
not
at
length
one
after
another
the
multitude
departed
save
a
few
who
encamped
beneath
trees
on
the
banks
of
the
river
joseph
of
arimathea
and
i
were
left
almost
alone
standing
near
the
prophet
and
regarding
him
with
reverential
curiosity
the
sun
was
just
disappearing
over
the
distant
towers
of
jericho
and
painting
with
the
richest
purple
the
hills
between
the
river
and
jerusalem
jordan
catching
its
reddening
radiance
rolled
past
like
a
river
of
liquid
gold
embanked
in
emerald
the
brow
of
the
prophet
lighted
up
by
a
that
shone
between
the
branches
of
a
pomegranate
tree
seemed
like
the
face
of
moses
when
he
came
down
from
sinai
a
glory
of
light
he
appeared
rapt
in
heavenly
meditation
and
we
stood
silent
and
gazed
upon
him
not
daring
to
speak
at
length
he
turned
towards
us
smiled
and
saluting
us
grasped
the
crook
or
staff
on
which
he
had
been
leaning
for
he
was
weary
and
pale
with
his
labors
of
the
day
and
slowly
walked
down
the
shore
in
the
direction
of
the
wilderness
he
had
not
advanced
many
steps
when
i
felt
an
irresistible
impulse
to
follow
him
i
therefore
said
to
my
companion
us
follow
him
and
learn
more
of
these
great
things
which
we
have
this
day
heard
we
proceeded
slowly
after
him
as
he
moved
in
a
contemplative
mood
along
the
desert
path
the
sun
had
already
gone
down
and
the
full
moon
rose
on
the
opposite
shore
and
the
prophet
stopped
as
if
to
gaze
upon
its
autumnal
beauty
we
drew
near
to
him
he
beheld
us
but
did
not
avoid
us
seeing
which
i
advanced
with
timid
confidence
and
said
prophet
of
the
most
high
god
wilt
thou
permit
two
young
men
of
israel
to
speak
to
thee
for
our
hearts
yearn
towards
thee
with
love
and
chiefly
would
we
inquire
of
thee
touching
the
advent
of
the
mighty
personage
whose
near
coming
thou
dost
foretell
said
the
prophet
in
a
calm
and
serene
manner
am
a
dweller
in
the
desert
and
alone
from
choice
i
approach
men
only
to
proclaim
my
message
the
delights
of
earth
are
not
for
me
my
mission
is
one
its
duration
is
short
its
aim
worthy
the
greatest
prophet
of
god
yet
am
i
the
least
of
them
not
worthy
to
be
called
a
prophet
and
before
the
splendor
of
him
whom
i
announce
to
the
world
i
am
the
dust
of
the
balance
if
thou
hast
sought
me
to
search
after
knowledge
come
and
sit
down
with
me
upon
this
rock
and
let
me
hear
what
thou
hast
to
ask
of
me
that
i
may
answer
thee
and
go
my
way
this
was
said
softly
gently
almost
sadly
and
in
a
tone
that
made
me
love
him
more
and
more
i
could
have
cast
myself
upon
his
bosom
and
wept
there
we
seated
ourselves
one
on
either
side
of
him
the
scene
and
the
hour
were
well
fitted
for
such
a
converse
as
we
were
about
to
hold
the
broad
disc
of
the
moon
poured
a
flood
of
radiance
full
upon
us
and
lent
a
hallowed
softness
to
the
divine
countenance
of
the
youthful
prophet
the
jordan
dark
as
india
dye
darted
swiftly
past
at
our
feet
between
its
banks
sending
up
to
our
ears
the
faintest
murmur
of
its
pebbly
passage
above
our
heads
swelled
the
vaulted
arch
of
the
temple
of
jehovah
with
its
myriad
of
altar
fires
behind
us
stretched
the
desert
waste
cheerless
and
yet
grand
in
its
desolate
distances
afar
off
rose
upon
the
air
and
was
borne
to
us
at
intervals
the
voice
of
a
singer
in
one
of
the
camps
and
near
us
upon
an
acacia
tree
sat
a
solitary
bulbul
which
ceaselessly
sang
its
sweet
and
varied
hymn
to
the
listening
moon
things
praise
god
shall
we
be
silent
said
the
prophet
us
sing
the
evening
hymn
of
the
temple
he
then
commenced
in
a
rich
melodious
chant
such
as
i
have
never
heard
from
the
priests
our
sacred
psalm
to
the
whole
creation
of
god
we
joined
our
voices
with
his
and
the
tide
of
praise
floated
over
the
waters
and
echoed
and
from
the
opposing
shores
as
if
the
banks
and
stream
trees
hills
and
sky
had
found
voice
as
well
as
we
praise
praise
ye
the
lord
praise
him
in
the
heights
praise
him
in
the
seas
praise
him
men
of
israel
praise
ye
the
lord
for
he
exalteth
high
his
people
and
reigneth
evermore
him
all
ye
angels
praise
him
all
ye
hosts
praise
him
sun
and
moon
and
all
ye
stars
of
light
praise
him
fire
and
hail
praise
him
storm
and
snows
for
he
judgeth
the
earth
in
righteousness
and
reigneth
evermore
praise
praise
ye
the
lord
praise
him
winged
fowl
and
herds
cattle
and
all
beasts
praise
him
kings
and
people
princes
priests
and
judges
praise
him
youths
and
maidens
old
men
and
children
the
name
let
them
praise
the
name
praise
the
name
of
the
lord
god
of
hosts
for
his
name
alone
is
excellent
his
glory
above
the
heavens
israel
is
his
a
people
praise
let
israel
therefore
praise
him
praise
him
evermore
evermore
ever
evermore
never
shall
i
forget
the
effect
produced
upon
my
inmost
being
by
this
hymn
the
prophet
sang
as
if
he
were
leading
a
choir
of
angels
my
heart
leaped
at
the
chorus
as
if
it
would
break
out
take
wing
and
leave
the
earth
when
we
called
on
the
winds
and
the
fowls
of
the
air
to
praise
jehovah
with
us
the
thrilling
voice
of
the
bulbul
seemed
to
pour
from
its
throat
a
wilder
richer
more
joyous
tide
of
song
and
the
audible
wind
bent
the
adoring
trees
and
mingled
its
mystic
whispers
with
the
psalm
of
men
surely
thought
i
it
is
good
for
me
to
be
here
for
this
is
none
other
than
the
gate
of
paradise
after
a
few
moments
silence
the
prophet
spoke
and
said
sought
me
brethren
of
israel
can
i
do
aught
for
you
would
hear
more
great
prophet
touching
this
mighty
one
who
is
to
come
after
thee
said
joseph
can
tell
thee
but
little
my
brethren
save
what
thou
hast
heard
from
me
this
day
the
future
is
veiled
i
bear
a
message
indeed
but
i
may
not
break
the
seal
and
read
to
you
it
will
be
given
to
know
what
is
now
unknown
to
me
if
it
be
permitted
me
to
see
him
it
will
be
but
for
a
brief
space
for
when
he
cometh
i
depart
my
errand
is
done
blessed
are
those
who
live
to
witness
his
glory
and
to
hear
the
gracious
voice
of
god
that
proceeds
from
his
anointed
lips
when
will
be
his
advent
and
with
what
form
and
power
cometh
this
divine
being
i
asked
a
man
but
not
with
comeliness
of
form
that
men
should
desire
him
his
appearance
will
be
humble
lowly
and
meek
you
said
rabbi
i
continued
his
power
should
be
infinite
and
that
of
his
kingdom
there
should
be
no
end
you
spoke
of
the
glory
of
his
dominions
and
the
humiliation
of
gentile
kings
beneath
his
sceptre
i
can
not
explain
it
is
a
mystery
to
me
i
speak
as
god
by
whom
i
am
sent
gives
me
utterance
i
know
that
he
who
cometh
after
me
is
greater
than
i
the
latchet
of
whose
shoes
i
am
not
worthy
to
unloose
taught
us
this
evening
holy
prophet
that
he
would
be
the
lord
from
heaven
and
yet
that
esaias
saith
he
will
be
despised
and
rejected
of
men
wounded
for
our
transgressions
and
bruised
for
our
iniquities
spirit
of
god
teaches
me
that
these
words
apply
to
shiloh
but
i
can
not
comprehend
how
these
things
can
be
he
answered
with
deep
sadness
i
remind
you
good
rabbi
said
joseph
you
taught
us
how
this
divine
personage
should
die
though
lord
of
life
and
be
numbered
in
his
death
with
transgressors
though
the
holy
one
of
god
such
will
be
the
events
that
are
to
happen
but
seek
not
to
know
what
no
man
hath
had
revealed
to
him
the
divine
messiah
himself
must
be
his
own
interpreter
blessed
will
be
the
eyes
that
behold
him
and
listen
to
the
wisdom
of
his
mouth
and
keep
the
law
of
his
lips
i
ask
you
holy
prophet
of
the
lord
said
joseph
is
it
that
he
whom
you
are
sent
by
god
to
bear
witness
to
can
be
the
deliverer
of
israel
when
you
predict
for
him
so
sad
a
fate
messiah
is
to
restore
jerusalem
and
the
glory
of
the
temple
so
saith
esaias
so
say
ezra
and
jeremiah
we
therefore
in
the
messiahs
of
the
prophets
have
looked
for
a
powerful
potentate
who
shall
reign
in
jerusalem
over
the
whole
earth
and
subdue
all
nations
kingdom
is
not
of
this
earth
answered
the
prophet
impressively
then
can
we
interpret
the
prophet
david
who
maketh
the
lord
to
say
i
have
set
my
king
upon
my
holy
hill
of
zion
also
how
shall
we
interpret
those
sayings
of
esaias
who
prophesying
of
the
blessed
christ
of
god
hath
these
words
of
the
increase
of
his
government
and
peace
there
shall
be
no
end
upon
the
throne
of
david
and
upon
his
kingdom
to
order
it
and
to
establish
it
with
judgment
and
with
justice
from
henceforth
even
forever
know
not
these
secrets
are
with
god
this
i
know
that
the
least
child
and
the
lowliest
hireling
that
liveth
in
the
day
of
messias
is
greater
than
i
am
the
last
of
the
prophets
it
is
for
me
to
open
the
last
door
that
leads
out
from
the
night
of
prophecy
into
the
glorious
dawn
of
the
day
of
fulfillment
but
i
am
not
permitted
to
enter
beyond
the
threshold
or
share
in
its
blessings
all
who
come
after
me
will
be
preferred
before
me
but
let
me
rejoice
that
the
is
about
to
rise
though
his
beams
shine
on
all
the
earth
but
me
this
was
said
with
the
most
touching
pathos
we
were
both
deeply
moved
i
myself
even
to
tears
i
sank
on
my
knees
and
kissing
his
hand
bathed
it
with
my
tears
he
gently
raised
me
and
said
in
a
sweet
voice
beloved
thou
shalt
see
him
to
whom
i
bear
witness
and
he
will
love
thee
and
thou
shalt
repose
in
his
bosom
i
burst
into
tears
and
rising
i
walked
a
little
ways
apart
and
lifting
up
my
eyes
toward
heaven
i
prayed
the
god
of
our
fathers
that
i
might
be
found
worthy
of
this
blessed
honor
shall
i
also
behold
this
mighty
son
of
god
asked
joseph
with
solicitude
the
prophet
took
his
hand
in
his
and
fixing
upon
him
his
eyes
of
prophetic
brightness
said
slowly
and
in
tones
and
painfully
sorrowful
shalt
one
day
bear
him
in
thine
arms
and
lay
him
upon
a
couch
which
thou
hast
prepared
for
thine
own
repose
thou
knowest
not
now
what
i
say
but
thou
shalt
remember
it
when
it
cometh
to
pass
when
he
had
thus
spoken
he
arose
and
waving
his
hand
to
us
both
he
walked
rapidly
away
towards
the
darkening
desert
thou
hear
him
at
length
after
some
minutes
pause
asked
joseph
of
me
can
his
words
mean
they
are
prophetic
of
some
fearful
event
his
eyes
betrayed
some
terrible
meaning
my
heart
is
troubled
mine
rejoiceth
i
answered
shall
see
him
i
shall
be
near
him
oh
if
he
be
like
this
sweet
prophet
of
god
i
shall
love
him
with
all
my
soul
being
how
wonderful
that
we
are
to
be
thus
associated
with
this
divine
person
welcome
the
hour
of
his
blessed
advent
thou
welcome
the
advent
of
a
sufferer
said
a
voice
so
near
that
it
startled
us
by
its
abruptness
and
looking
round
we
saw
standing
within
the
shadow
of
a
wild
olive
tree
a
young
man
who
was
a
stranger
but
to
whom
i
afterwards
became
deeply
attached
his
face
was
pale
and
intellectual
and
his
form
slight
but
of
the
most
symmetrical
elegance
his
question
at
once
made
me
sorrowful
for
it
recalled
the
sad
prophecy
of
esaias
is
also
to
be
king
and
monarch
of
the
world
and
infinitely
holy
and
good
i
said
thou
hast
been
near
thou
hast
heard
the
glorious
things
the
prophet
has
spoken
of
him
have
been
near
i
was
reclining
beneath
this
tree
when
you
seated
yourselves
there
be
not
deceived
the
divine
man
who
is
to
come
is
to
be
a
man
of
sorrows
and
acquainted
with
grief
he
is
to
be
rejected
by
israel
and
despised
by
judah
those
whom
he
comes
to
bless
will
despise
him
for
his
lowliness
and
obscurity
his
life
will
be
a
life
of
tears
and
toil
and
heaviness
of
heart
and
he
will
at
last
be
cut
off
from
among
the
living
with
the
ignominy
due
only
to
a
transgressor
dost
thou
welcome
the
advent
of
a
sufferer
how
knowest
thou
this
art
thou
a
prophet
i
asked
with
surprise
and
admiration
brother
but
i
have
read
the
prophets
i
heard
moreover
the
words
of
this
holy
man
sent
from
god
and
he
dwells
more
on
the
humility
of
the
christ
than
on
his
kingly
grandeur
believe
me
the
kingdom
of
shiloh
is
not
of
this
world
it
can
not
be
of
this
world
if
such
is
to
be
his
life
and
death
and
that
it
is
to
be
his
life
esaias
clearly
states
let
me
read
to
you
his
words
he
then
took
a
roll
of
parchment
from
his
bosom
and
read
by
the
clear
tropical
moonlight
that
mysterious
and
inexplicable
passage
which
beginneth
with
the
words
hath
believed
our
report
when
he
had
ended
he
resumed
is
not
the
history
of
a
prosperous
earthly
monarch
but
rather
the
painful
record
of
a
life
of
humiliation
of
shame
and
of
contempt
thou
dost
not
say
brother
said
joseph
with
some
warmth
the
sacred
person
borne
witness
to
by
this
prophet
is
to
be
an
object
of
contempt
not
esaias
say
that
he
will
be
despised
beaten
with
stripes
rejected
of
men
imprisoned
and
put
to
death
like
a
transgressor
of
the
law
can
be
no
question
but
that
esaias
speaks
of
the
messiah
i
remarked
prophet
of
jordan
now
bears
full
testimony
to
esaias
and
plainly
maketh
application
of
his
words
to
him
whom
he
has
come
beforehand
to
proclaim
answered
the
young
man
with
singularly
graceful
eloquence
in
all
he
said
us
who
have
been
baptized
this
day
for
the
remission
of
our
sins
expect
a
messiah
of
sorrows
not
a
conquering
prince
let
us
behold
one
who
is
to
humble
himself
beneath
the
yoke
of
human
infirmities
that
he
may
be
exalted
and
draw
all
men
after
him
to
a
kingdom
in
the
heavens
the
throne
of
david
objected
joseph
at
the
right
hand
of
god
jerusalem
and
its
rule
over
the
nations
that
is
above
will
be
over
all
his
kingdom
that
is
to
be
everlasting
where
life
is
everlasting
how
can
he
rule
an
everlasting
realm
here
on
earth
without
living
forever
and
his
subjects
also
read
not
the
prophets
so
as
adam
fell
and
lost
paradise
so
messias
like
a
second
adam
must
as
man
humble
himself
in
human
nature
to
repurchase
the
kingdom
of
paradise
for
the
race
of
man
it
is
this
kingdom
which
this
prophet
proclaims
as
being
at
hand
he
being
the
bearer
of
our
iniquities
we
shall
thereby
escape
their
chastisement
healed
by
his
stripes
we
shall
be
free
from
our
sins
laid
upon
him
will
be
the
transgressions
of
the
world
and
by
one
mighty
sacrifice
of
himself
thus
laden
as
a
he
shall
offer
an
atonement
to
make
one
with
jehovah
the
great
family
of
adam
such
is
to
be
our
messiah
alas
while
we
look
for
him
let
us
mingle
tears
with
our
gladness
that
one
so
holy
and
excellent
should
be
destined
to
endure
these
things
for
our
sakes
and
when
we
behold
him
let
us
sink
at
his
feet
in
grateful
adoration
of
his
love
when
the
young
man
had
spoken
he
walked
away
impelled
by
an
unconquerable
impulse
i
followed
and
took
him
in
my
arms
and
embracing
him
said
a
truth
thou
art
a
prophet
thy
words
come
home
to
my
heart
like
the
echo
of
ancient
prophecy
i
have
learned
these
things
from
the
study
of
the
scripture
he
said
with
angelic
candor
and
modesty
i
have
been
aided
how
much
i
have
no
words
to
tell
thee
by
one
who
hath
wisdom
and
truth
abiding
in
him
above
all
men
and
whom
it
is
my
happiness
to
have
my
bosom
friend
as
he
is
near
my
own
age
if
i
am
wise
or
virtuous
or
good
or
know
the
scriptures
it
is
that
he
hath
been
my
counselor
and
teacher
is
his
name
i
asked
i
also
would
go
and
learn
of
him
withdraws
from
the
public
eye
and
hath
little
converse
but
with
few
and
shuns
all
notice
without
his
permission
i
could
not
take
thee
to
him
is
his
appearance
and
where
doth
he
dwell
i
inquired
more
deeply
interested
abides
at
present
at
bethany
my
own
city
he
is
so
beloved
by
us
that
we
detain
him
as
our
guest
but
he
dwelleth
at
other
times
with
his
mother
a
holy
widow
of
great
sanctity
and
matronly
dignity
living
at
nazareth
in
humble
condition
and
he
contributes
by
labor
to
her
support
with
the
most
exemplary
filial
piety
no
person
ever
approaches
and
speaks
with
him
without
leaving
a
wiser
and
better
man
said
joseph
and
i
together
have
only
increased
our
desire
to
behold
him
his
appearance
must
be
noble
sits
upon
his
brow
a
serene
dignity
tempered
with
mildness
that
commands
the
respect
of
age
and
wins
the
confiding
love
of
childhood
his
eyes
beam
with
a
light
calm
and
pure
as
if
shining
from
interior
holy
thoughts
and
they
rest
upon
you
when
he
speaks
with
a
tenderness
that
is
like
the
dewy
light
of
the
young
gaze
when
she
bends
in
silent
happiness
and
tears
over
the
face
of
her
his
face
is
one
soft
sunshine
of
smiling
rays
tempered
in
an
indescribable
manner
with
a
settled
look
of
sadness
an
almost
imperceptible
shade
of
permanent
sorrow
that
seems
to
foreshadow
a
life
of
trial
and
suffering
must
be
another
prophet
said
joseph
with
deep
earnestness
does
not
prophesy
nor
preach
answered
the
young
man
is
his
name
i
asked
the
nazarene
as
the
young
man
was
then
about
to
move
away
i
asked
him
his
name
as
he
had
greatly
drawn
out
my
heart
towards
him
and
i
felt
that
if
i
could
be
his
friend
and
the
friend
of
the
wise
young
man
of
nazareth
i
should
be
perfectly
happy
and
have
no
other
desire
save
indeed
to
live
till
the
messiah
came
that
i
might
behold
him
and
lay
my
head
upon
his
sacred
bosom
name
is
lazarus
the
scribe
he
answered
what
interrupted
mary
then
i
know
him
well
he
is
the
brother
of
mary
and
martha
my
friends
at
bethany
where
i
passed
a
week
last
year
just
before
the
passover
the
next
day
continued
john
we
renewed
our
acquaintance
and
after
three
days
departed
together
homeward
upon
arriving
at
bethany
lazarus
learned
that
his
friend
had
gone
to
cana
in
galilee
on
a
visit
with
his
mother
to
the
house
of
one
of
her
kinfolk
whose
daughter
is
soon
to
be
married
having
now
my
dear
father
communicated
to
you
all
that
john
related
to
us
you
will
see
what
grounds
there
are
to
look
upon
the
prophet
of
jordan
as
a
man
sent
from
god
or
to
believe
that
he
is
the
true
elias
whom
malachi
hath
foretold
and
who
as
the
most
learned
of
the
scribes
say
must
first
come
to
proclaim
the
approach
of
the
prince
of
peace
the
shiloh
of
israel
hopes
the
account
brought
by
john
has
set
rabbi
amos
to
studying
the
prophets
and
indeed
all
men
are
looking
into
them
with
interest
unknown
before
may
god
be
indeed
about
to
bless
his
people
and
remember
his
inheritance
your
affectionate
daughter
adina
letter
vi
my
dear
father
your
letter
dear
father
commands
me
to
banish
this
novelty
from
my
mind
and
continue
humbly
to
worship
jehovah
after
the
manner
of
our
fathers
i
trust
this
i
shall
ever
do
my
dear
father
and
did
i
discover
in
this
prophet
any
disposition
to
bring
in
a
new
faith
opposed
to
the
ancient
faith
of
abraham
i
should
tremble
to
entertain
it
for
a
moment
you
say
that
this
man
must
be
a
false
and
base
prophet
or
he
would
not
herald
a
master
so
low
and
despised
as
he
professes
will
be
the
christ
he
bears
witness
to
the
kingdom
of
messias
is
not
a
kingdom
of
repentance
and
humiliation
you
add
but
one
of
victory
of
glory
and
dominion
illustration
the
temple
of
herod
in
the
time
of
christ
this
cut
is
designed
after
the
model
prepared
by
the
student
and
traveler
sir
james
ferguson
how
can
i
write
to
you
my
dear
father
that
which
is
now
rushing
to
my
pen
after
such
an
expression
of
your
sentiments
as
you
have
made
in
this
extract
from
your
letter
but
i
know
you
are
wise
and
will
not
evade
truth
in
whatever
form
it
may
offer
itself
to
you
and
i
therefore
with
confidence
in
your
justice
and
wisdom
will
faithfully
make
known
to
you
the
events
relating
to
the
prophet
which
have
transpired
you
will
remember
how
that
john
mary
cousin
stated
that
many
priests
and
others
were
offended
at
the
plain
preaching
of
the
prophet
whom
they
went
out
into
the
wilderness
to
see
when
they
returned
to
jerusalem
and
made
known
to
the
other
members
of
the
house
of
the
priests
what
had
been
spoken
against
them
by
the
application
to
them
of
the
words
of
esaias
and
jeremias
and
other
prophets
there
arose
at
once
a
great
outcry
against
him
at
length
annas
who
is
high
priest
with
caiaphas
sent
two
of
the
most
learned
men
of
the
temple
levites
of
weight
of
character
to
invite
the
prophet
to
jerusalem
for
annas
is
a
wise
man
and
not
easily
carried
away
by
popular
feeling
and
as
rabbi
amos
hath
told
me
he
is
disposed
to
look
upon
the
preaching
of
this
john
with
a
serious
and
reverential
eye
the
messengers
returned
after
the
fifth
day
and
made
their
report
openly
in
the
court
of
the
temple
where
the
high
priests
sat
to
receive
them
at
length
the
assembly
being
convened
the
two
learned
and
venerable
levites
both
rose
up
and
declared
that
they
had
delivered
the
message
to
john
the
son
of
zacharias
the
prophet
of
jordan
and
that
his
answer
was
given
with
the
reverence
due
to
the
station
of
the
high
priest
who
had
sent
to
him
and
say
to
the
noble
high
priest
said
he
i
am
the
voice
of
one
crying
in
the
wilderness
as
it
is
written
in
the
book
of
the
words
of
esaias
the
prophet
who
foreseeing
my
day
saith
the
voice
of
one
crying
in
the
wilderness
prepare
ye
the
way
of
the
lord
make
his
paths
straight
he
who
would
hear
my
testimony
to
him
who
is
to
come
after
me
let
him
seek
me
in
the
wilderness
whence
only
i
am
commanded
to
lift
up
my
voice
till
shiloh
come
when
the
priests
heard
this
answer
they
were
greatly
enraged
and
many
fiercely
cried
one
thing
and
many
another
some
that
he
should
be
sought
out
and
stoned
to
death
for
defying
the
high
priest
others
that
he
should
be
accused
to
the
procurator
pontius
pilate
governor
of
judea
as
a
seditious
and
dangerous
person
and
fermenter
of
insurrections
caiaphas
was
of
the
latter
opinion
but
the
milder
annas
viewed
the
whole
matter
in
a
different
light
and
said
men
and
brethren
let
nothing
be
done
hastily
if
this
man
be
a
false
prophet
he
will
soon
perish
and
we
shall
hear
no
more
of
him
if
peradventure
as
it
would
appear
he
is
sent
from
god
let
us
not
make
haste
to
do
him
a
mischief
lest
haply
we
be
found
contending
against
the
lord
of
hosts
this
moderation
found
favor
with
but
few
and
of
these
few
rabbi
amos
was
one
but
if
the
priests
who
thronged
the
outer
court
in
presence
of
the
high
priest
were
deeply
moved
at
the
report
of
the
answer
their
excitement
became
uncontrollable
when
both
melchi
and
heli
their
messengers
rose
up
waving
their
hands
for
silence
and
declared
that
after
having
listened
to
the
prophet
to
whom
they
had
been
sent
they
were
convinced
of
the
truth
of
his
words
and
of
his
divine
commission
and
had
been
baptized
of
him
in
jordan
confessing
their
sins
only
the
sanctity
of
the
temple
prevented
the
five
hundred
priests
rushing
upon
them
and
smiting
them
when
they
heard
this
they
were
at
once
placed
under
arrest
by
order
of
the
high
priest
caiaphas
for
acting
in
a
manner
unbecoming
a
priest
of
the
most
high
god
the
people
who
had
heard
john
preach
however
were
only
prevented
from
rescuing
the
two
priests
by
the
presence
of
a
guard
of
roman
soldiers
for
which
caiaphas
promptly
sent
from
this
account
my
dear
father
you
can
form
some
idea
of
the
excitement
which
the
preaching
of
this
new
prophet
is
producing
among
all
classes
if
the
prince
of
glory
should
indeed
suddenly
appear
there
could
be
scarcely
more
excitement
though
it
would
be
of
a
different
nature
as
next
week
rabbi
amos
does
not
serve
in
his
course
in
the
temple
and
as
he
will
have
some
affairs
that
take
him
to
gilgal
he
has
yielded
to
the
desire
of
his
daughter
mary
and
myself
to
accompany
him
for
he
does
not
conceal
from
us
that
he
shall
make
it
a
point
to
visit
and
hear
the
prophet
as
it
will
be
but
two
hours
travel
from
gilgal
to
the
place
where
he
preaches
you
will
i
fear
me
object
to
this
journey
but
if
the
worship
of
our
fathers
has
nothing
to
fear
from
falsehood
it
surely
has
naught
to
fear
from
truth
and
in
either
case
i
as
a
true
daughter
of
israel
have
nothing
to
fear
if
the
prophet
teach
what
is
false
i
shall
remain
true
and
if
he
teach
that
which
is
true
shall
i
not
be
the
gainer
one
thing
is
clear
if
the
christ
that
john
prophesies
be
the
true
son
of
the
highest
and
is
in
reality
to
make
his
appearance
ere
long
in
humiliation
and
poverty
his
rejection
by
the
high
priests
and
by
the
rich
and
powerful
of
judah
is
certain
may
god
then
remove
blindness
from
our
eyes
that
if
this
be
the
very
messias
indeed
israel
may
recognize
their
king
when
he
cometh
and
not
do
so
fearful
a
thing
in
their
pride
as
to
reject
him
openly
you
will
remember
the
young
roman
centurion
to
whose
courtesy
i
was
indebted
for
rescuing
me
from
the
rudeness
of
the
two
gentile
soldiers
he
has
preserved
since
then
acquaintance
with
rabbi
amos
who
speaks
of
him
with
respect
and
as
he
has
of
late
expressed
some
interest
in
knowing
what
the
studies
are
which
occupy
the
rabbi
so
constantly
when
he
calls
to
see
him
the
rabbi
sent
for
me
to
come
into
the
marble
hall
of
the
corridor
where
they
sat
by
the
fountain
under
the
shade
of
the
acacia
which
amos
says
you
took
with
your
own
hands
from
grave
and
planted
here
many
years
ago
and
which
i
therefore
call
my
father
tree
come
hither
adina
said
my
uncle
in
his
benevolent
tones
here
you
behold
a
noble
roman
youth
whom
you
must
be
too
generous
to
have
forgotten
i
bowed
and
scarcely
lifted
my
eyelids
from
the
tesselated
floor
for
there
was
a
fire
in
the
glance
of
the
handsome
youth
that
they
could
not
encounter
he
said
some
words
of
salutation
but
i
only
heard
the
voice
which
fell
upon
my
heart
with
a
strange
vibration
like
the
effects
of
music
the
roman
centurion
continued
amos
hath
desired
to
know
something
of
the
sacred
books
of
our
nation
of
which
he
saith
he
hath
heard
much
and
of
the
prophecies
from
which
he
believes
the
famed
sibylline
books
were
composed
then
turning
to
the
centurion
here
is
an
egyptian
maiden
who
can
interpret
for
thee
in
the
idiom
of
grecia
or
of
italia
and
i
will
place
the
sacred
roll
in
her
hands
while
i
listen
come
adina
open
and
read
the
beginning
of
the
book
of
moses
to
this
narrative
the
youthful
warrior
listened
with
the
profoundest
respect
and
attention
he
asked
if
the
messias
had
yet
come
who
was
to
restore
all
things
and
if
not
when
he
was
to
be
looked
for
this
inquiry
led
to
a
conversation
upon
the
preaching
of
john
in
the
wilderness
and
his
predictions
of
the
near
advent
of
shiloh
rabbi
amos
seeing
that
he
was
becoming
deeply
interested
in
the
subject
made
me
turn
to
the
particular
prophecies
of
daniel
esaias
david
and
others
and
read
them
to
him
both
those
which
described
in
golden
words
the
glory
and
dominion
of
his
power
and
those
which
represented
him
as
despised
and
rejected
the
young
man
remained
some
time
very
thoughtful
at
length
he
said
with
animation
i
can
now
comprehend
why
men
run
into
the
wilderness
i
should
like
to
hear
this
prophet
when
amos
told
him
that
he
contemplated
journeying
to
gilgal
the
next
week
and
intended
to
visit
the
desert
to
hear
him
he
at
once
asked
permission
to
be
of
his
company
saying
i
will
accompany
you
with
a
squadron
of
horse
as
the
roads
are
not
safe
for
no
longer
ago
than
yesterday
we
received
a
rumor
that
the
celebrated
robber
chief
barabbas
at
the
head
of
a
large
band
has
made
his
appearance
again
on
the
hills
between
ephraim
and
jericho
it
is
therefore
decided
dear
father
that
we
leave
early
next
week
for
jericho
and
gilgal
on
my
return
i
shall
not
fail
to
write
you
without
delay
till
then
withhold
your
judgment
and
have
confidence
in
mine
with
holy
aspirations
for
the
coming
of
the
kingdom
of
david
and
the
restoration
of
his
throne
in
zion
i
remain
with
filial
love
your
daughter
adina
letter
vii
my
dear
father
you
will
recollect
that
in
my
last
epistle
i
made
mention
of
our
intention
to
go
to
gilgal
where
john
the
betrothed
of
mary
was
to
meet
us
and
accompany
us
to
jordan
it
was
faint
dawn
when
we
rose
from
our
couches
to
prepare
for
the
journey
the
mules
upon
which
we
were
to
ride
were
brought
into
the
court
by
the
two
swarthy
gibeonite
serfs
whom
rabbi
amos
holds
in
his
service
and
caparisoned
with
rich
saddles
covered
with
persian
embroidered
with
gold
the
two
pack
mules
were
also
made
ready
on
one
of
which
was
the
traveling
equipage
of
my
cousin
mary
and
myself
which
rabbi
amos
smilingly
said
took
up
more
space
than
the
goods
and
traveling
wares
of
a
damascus
merchant
at
sunrise
after
we
had
kneeled
upon
the
housetop
in
view
of
the
temple
and
sent
up
our
prayers
with
its
sacrifices
and
clouds
of
ascending
incense
we
descended
to
the
to
mount
for
the
road
the
morning
was
bright
and
cheerful
with
the
golden
sun
pouring
its
light
over
temple
and
tower
castle
and
roof
wall
and
rampart
hill
and
grove
valley
and
brook
as
we
turned
the
street
leading
to
the
sheep
gate
we
passed
the
house
of
caiaphas
the
high
priest
whom
i
saw
standing
upon
the
marble
porch
of
his
superb
palace
he
was
not
arrayed
in
his
sumptuous
robes
with
the
of
dazzling
stones
and
kingly
cap
as
i
had
seen
him
in
the
temple
but
was
dressed
in
a
flowing
black
robe
over
which
was
thrown
a
scarf
of
white
linen
and
upon
his
locks
he
wore
a
scarlet
hood
a
dress
common
to
all
the
priests
so
that
if
i
had
not
recognized
him
by
his
tall
and
commanding
form
and
flowing
white
hair
and
piercing
eye
as
he
surveyed
us
i
should
have
known
that
it
was
the
high
priest
a
little
further
on
we
met
a
party
coming
from
the
country
beyond
kedron
with
large
cages
upon
their
mules
laden
with
turtle
doves
and
young
pigeons
which
they
were
carrying
to
the
temple
to
be
sold
there
for
sacrifices
my
heart
pitied
the
innocent
things
whose
blue
pretty
heads
were
thrust
by
the
dozen
through
the
rough
bars
of
their
as
they
cast
their
soft
eyes
up
at
me
as
if
asking
me
to
deliver
them
from
their
bondage
as
mary
was
riding
behind
me
in
order
to
let
the
laden
mules
pass
with
their
immense
cages
one
of
the
turtle
doves
affrighted
by
the
noise
of
the
streets
extricated
itself
from
between
the
bars
and
spreading
its
wings
flew
into
the
air
and
then
taking
its
flight
for
the
country
soared
far
above
the
city
walls
and
disappeared
in
the
distance
i
felt
rejoiced
at
the
innocent
escape
and
sent
my
good
wishes
for
its
safe
return
to
its
lodge
in
the
wilderness
just
before
we
reached
the
sheep
gate
by
which
we
were
to
gain
the
jericho
road
we
met
a
poor
blind
man
leading
a
lamb
or
rather
being
led
by
a
tame
lamb
he
also
had
two
pigeons
in
his
bosom
he
was
asked
by
rabbi
amos
who
knew
him
whither
he
was
going
he
answered
that
he
was
going
to
the
temple
to
sacrifice
them
nay
said
amos
with
surprise
thou
wilt
not
sacrifice
thy
lamb
bartimeus
it
is
an
offering
to
god
rabbi
amos
but
thy
lamb
leadeth
thee
everywhere
it
is
eyes
to
thee
thou
canst
not
do
without
it
and
thy
doves
thou
earnest
by
them
many
a
mite
in
a
day
they
are
so
well
taught
in
cunning
and
pleasant
tricks
to
please
children
if
thou
wilt
sacrifice
spare
these
so
needful
to
thee
and
here
is
money
to
buy
doves
and
another
lamb
answered
my
benevolent
uncle
hear
what
i
have
to
say
answered
bartimeus
my
father
became
sick
and
was
likely
to
die
the
next
day
my
mother
who
has
nourished
my
childhood
and
loved
me
though
i
was
born
blind
with
all
her
heart
was
also
taken
sick
the
same
night
my
little
daughter
my
little
blind
daughter
whose
face
i
never
saw
and
who
never
saw
her
father
face
was
sick
nigh
unto
death
my
father
my
mother
my
child
are
now
restored
and
in
my
joy
i
am
on
my
way
to
the
temple
to
offer
these
gifts
of
god
to
him
it
will
not
be
hard
to
part
with
them
since
in
giving
all
that
i
have
i
but
show
my
love
to
god
with
these
words
he
went
on
the
lamb
obeying
the
string
which
he
held
softly
moving
on
before
while
i
could
see
the
sightless
eyes
of
the
righteous
son
and
pious
father
trickle
tears
as
he
kissed
and
kissed
again
the
precious
doves
that
lay
in
his
bosom
this
little
occurrence
made
me
sad
yet
i
honored
the
resolute
piety
of
this
poor
man
whose
eyes
though
they
saw
not
men
seemed
to
see
god
and
feel
his
presence
there
is
still
humble
piety
in
the
land
my
dear
father
and
finding
it
not
among
the
proud
and
splendid
priests
we
must
look
for
it
in
the
hearts
of
the
poor
and
humble
like
bartimeus
once
outside
the
gates
the
air
blew
fresh
from
the
hills
of
olives
after
being
so
long
confined
within
the
walls
and
narrow
streets
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
just
broken
out
of
my
cage
like
the
pretty
turtle
dove
and
i
felt
like
winging
my
way
too
to
the
free
deserts
we
had
hardly
reached
the
place
where
the
two
roads
meet
when
we
heard
to
the
west
the
sound
of
the
galloping
of
a
large
body
of
horse
and
the
next
moment
the
young
roman
centurion
came
in
sight
riding
at
the
head
of
a
troop
of
horse
whose
martial
appearance
with
the
ringing
of
their
armor
and
the
melody
of
their
bugles
made
my
blood
leap
æmilius
looked
like
a
prince
and
his
burnished
armor
shone
in
the
sun
like
armor
of
fire
at
his
side
rode
a
youth
who
bore
the
eagle
of
his
band
but
the
centurion
himself
carried
in
his
hand
only
the
badge
of
his
rank
which
was
a
bound
with
rings
of
gold
he
saluted
us
with
that
courtesy
which
distinguishes
his
every
motion
and
then
dividing
his
troop
into
two
bodies
half
of
whom
trotting
on
ahead
led
the
van
and
the
other
half
falling
behind
served
as
a
he
then
gave
the
word
to
move
forward
farewell
dear
father
till
my
next
when
i
will
resume
my
narrative
of
the
events
which
have
taken
place
since
i
left
jerusalem
the
god
of
our
father
abraham
be
your
defence
and
shield
your
affectionate
daughter
adina
letter
viii
my
dear
father
my
last
letter
ended
with
an
account
of
the
roman
escort
under
the
authority
of
the
young
roman
centurion
who
as
i
have
before
written
to
you
with
so
much
courtesy
proffered
its
protection
to
our
little
party
the
day
was
yet
early
and
the
air
was
of
that
buoyant
elasticity
so
agreeable
to
breathe
and
which
strikes
me
as
one
of
the
peculiar
blessings
of
this
holy
land
of
our
fathers
as
i
rode
along
i
felt
as
if
i
would
gladly
mount
the
arabian
of
the
desert
and
fly
across
the
sandy
seas
of
edom
with
the
fleetness
which
amazes
me
whenever
i
see
the
children
of
the
desert
ride
for
a
band
of
thirty
came
boldly
near
us
from
a
gorge
as
we
approached
bethany
and
after
watching
us
a
few
moments
scoured
away
into
the
recesses
of
the
hills
like
the
wind
as
a
detachment
of
our
roman
escort
was
ordered
to
gallop
towards
them
we
were
fortunate
in
having
such
strong
protection
we
soon
afterwards
reached
the
summit
of
the
ridge
above
bethany
from
which
eminence
we
had
a
gorgeous
view
of
the
holy
city
of
god
with
its
lofty
temple
glittering
in
the
sunbeams
the
tower
of
antonia
darkly
contrasted
with
its
splendor
and
the
citadel
of
david
frowned
over
the
walls
with
a
warlike
majesty
that
deeply
impressed
me
i
drew
rein
and
entreated
rabbi
amos
to
delay
a
few
moments
while
i
surveyed
jerusalem
but
he
was
too
far
ahead
to
hear
me
and
the
centurion
riding
up
to
my
side
stopped
respectfully
with
a
portion
of
his
command
and
said
he
would
await
my
leisure
i
could
not
but
thank
him
for
his
civility
and
then
turning
towards
the
city
i
was
soon
lost
to
all
else
but
the
awful
contemplation
of
it
you
should
see
rome
said
the
centurion
who
had
watched
my
emotion
evidently
with
surprise
it
is
a
city
of
grandeur
unequalled
it
covers
six
times
more
space
than
this
city
and
it
contains
three
hundred
and
temples
while
jerusalem
contains
but
one
there
is
no
god
but
one
i
answered
impressively
we
believe
there
is
one
god
who
is
the
author
of
a
great
multitude
of
lesser
gods
and
to
each
we
erect
a
temple
he
said
firmly
yet
respectfully
illustration
rome
upon
this
touched
with
pity
that
one
so
noble
in
mind
and
person
should
be
so
ignorant
of
the
truth
i
began
to
show
him
from
the
prophets
that
god
was
one
and
that
all
things
were
made
by
him
but
he
plucking
a
blossom
from
a
tree
within
reach
said
it
is
beneath
the
dignity
of
the
father
of
the
gods
the
great
jove
to
descend
to
make
a
flower
like
this
or
shape
a
crystal
or
color
the
ruby
or
create
that
which
flutters
among
those
fragrant
blossoms
he
made
the
sun
and
moon
and
stars
and
earth
but
left
the
lesser
works
to
inferior
deities
talk
to
me
of
thy
one
god
and
prove
to
me
maiden
that
he
made
all
things
and
is
one
and
thy
god
shall
be
my
god
we
now
rode
forward
through
the
street
of
bethany
and
soon
came
to
the
house
of
our
former
friend
rabbi
abel
who
died
many
years
ago
at
alexandria
when
he
went
there
with
merchandise
and
after
the
welfare
of
whose
children
you
desired
me
to
make
inquiries
it
was
a
plain
and
humble
dwelling
before
which
rabbi
amos
assisted
me
to
alight
but
there
was
an
air
of
neatness
and
sweet
domestic
repose
about
it
that
at
once
came
home
to
my
heart
and
made
me
love
the
place
even
before
i
had
seen
the
inmates
on
hearing
of
my
arrival
there
came
out
a
fair
young
girl
of
with
the
most
amiable
expression
of
affectionate
welcome
and
approaching
me
with
mingled
respect
and
love
she
embraced
me
while
rabbi
amos
pronounced
our
names
to
each
other
i
felt
immediately
as
if
i
were
in
a
sister
arms
and
that
i
should
love
her
always
next
came
forth
a
young
man
of
about
thirty
years
of
age
with
a
countenance
of
an
exceedingly
interesting
expression
full
of
intellect
and
good
will
he
was
pale
and
habitually
thoughtful
but
a
fine
friendly
light
beamed
in
his
dark
handsome
eyes
as
he
extended
his
hand
to
welcome
me
you
have
already
had
a
full
description
of
him
and
of
his
character
in
one
of
my
former
letters
and
need
not
be
told
that
it
was
lazarus
the
son
of
your
friend
at
the
threshold
martha
the
eldest
sister
met
me
but
with
more
ceremony
and
made
an
apology
for
receiving
me
the
rich
heiress
of
alexandria
as
she
termed
me
into
so
lowly
a
dwelling
but
i
embraced
her
so
affectionately
that
this
feeling
passed
away
instantly
martha
busied
herself
at
once
to
prepare
refreshments
for
us
and
soon
set
before
us
a
frugal
but
agreeable
repast
mary
in
the
meanwhile
and
lazarus
sat
on
either
side
of
me
and
asked
me
many
questions
about
alexandria
i
can
not
describe
to
you
the
loveliness
of
the
person
of
mary
and
yet
not
so
much
the
perfection
of
features
as
the
soul
which
animates
them
and
lends
them
a
charm
that
i
can
not
adequately
convey
to
you
martha
the
oldest
is
of
a
more
lively
disposition
yet
more
commanding
in
her
aspect
being
taller
and
almost
queenly
in
her
mien
her
eyes
and
her
hair
are
jet
black
the
former
mild
and
beaming
with
intelligence
like
those
of
her
brother
lazarus
whom
she
resembles
she
has
a
winning
voice
and
a
manner
that
leads
you
to
feel
strong
confidence
in
her
friendship
she
seemed
to
take
the
whole
management
of
our
entertainment
upon
herself
lazarus
conversed
chiefly
with
rabbi
amos
who
questioned
him
with
much
interest
about
the
prophet
john
of
the
wilderness
after
our
repast
martha
showed
me
three
beautiful
bands
of
embroidery
which
she
was
working
for
the
new
vail
of
the
temple
to
be
put
on
next
year
for
the
sisters
live
by
working
for
the
temple
and
lazarus
makes
copies
of
the
laws
and
psalms
for
the
priests
he
showed
me
his
and
the
rolls
of
parchment
upon
it
some
partly
inscribed
in
beautiful
characters
some
quite
complete
he
also
showed
me
a
copy
of
the
book
of
isaiah
which
had
occupied
him
one
hundred
and
seven
days
it
was
exquisitely
executed
seeing
upon
the
table
a
richly
worked
of
silk
and
velvet
with
the
letters
embroidered
in
olive
leaves
upon
it
i
asked
mary
if
that
being
so
elegant
was
not
for
the
high
priest
no
answered
martha
with
brightening
eyes
speaking
before
her
sister
could
reply
that
is
for
our
friend
and
the
friend
and
brother
of
lazarus
what
is
his
name
i
asked
jesus
of
nazareth
i
have
heard
john
speak
of
this
person
said
my
cousin
mary
with
animation
i
should
feel
happy
to
know
him
also
if
you
had
been
here
a
few
days
ago
replied
martha
you
would
have
seen
him
he
left
us
after
being
with
us
three
weeks
to
return
to
nazareth
but
he
requested
to
meet
lazarus
at
bethabara
on
the
third
day
from
this
for
some
important
reason
and
my
brother
will
go
for
he
loves
him
so
that
he
would
cross
the
seas
to
meet
him
then
said
rabbi
amos
to
lazarus
if
you
are
to
journey
so
soon
towards
jordan
to
meet
your
friend
you
had
best
join
our
company
and
share
our
escort
to
this
lazarus
consented
i
left
this
blessed
abode
with
regret
and
felt
that
i
should
be
perfectly
happy
if
i
could
be
admitted
as
a
fifth
link
in
the
wealth
of
their
mutual
love
about
noon
we
stopped
at
a
caravanserai
half
the
way
to
jericho
from
bethany
here
we
overtook
a
friend
of
rabbi
amos
the
venerable
and
learned
scholar
and
lawyer
gamaliel
accompanying
the
lawyer
gamaliel
was
a
young
man
who
was
his
disciple
and
who
went
with
him
as
a
companion
by
the
way
his
name
is
saul
and
i
noticed
him
particularly
because
i
overheard
the
venerable
lawyer
say
that
he
was
the
most
remarkable
young
man
who
had
ever
sat
at
his
feet
to
learn
the
mysteries
of
the
law
this
young
law
disciple
and
lazarus
rode
together
and
talked
long
and
earnestly
by
the
way
the
former
thinking
that
nothing
but
mischief
would
come
of
the
new
prophet
preaching
while
the
latter
warmly
defended
him
and
his
mission
as
divine
to
their
conversation
the
roman
centurion
listened
with
the
closest
attention
for
saul
was
learned
in
the
prophets
and
drew
richly
from
its
stores
to
prove
that
the
true
messias
can
never
be
heralded
by
so
mean
a
messenger
as
this
preacher
of
repentance
in
the
wilderness
i
now
write
to
thee
beneath
the
roof
of
the
country
residence
of
rabbi
amos
early
we
are
going
to
bethabara
a
little
village
beyond
jordan
but
situated
on
its
banks
near
which
we
learn
john
is
now
baptizing
lazarus
has
gone
on
with
saul
and
the
learned
gamaliel
with
many
lawyers
and
doctors
in
company
who
desire
to
see
and
hear
this
prophet
of
the
wilderness
that
the
hope
of
israel
may
not
be
long
deferred
and
that
we
may
receive
the
messias
when
he
cometh
in
humble
faith
in
honor
and
in
love
is
the
prayer
of
your
affectionate
daughter
adina
letter
ix
my
dear
father
in
these
letters
to
you
i
hope
you
will
pardon
the
details
which
i
enter
into
for
it
is
my
earnest
desire
that
you
should
see
everything
with
my
eyes
as
if
you
had
been
present
with
me
in
order
that
you
may
be
able
to
judge
of
the
remarkable
events
of
which
i
have
undertaken
to
give
you
a
complete
history
after
rabbi
amos
had
reached
the
house
in
the
wheat
fields
of
gilgal
he
kindly
told
us
that
he
was
ready
to
accompany
my
cousin
mary
and
myself
to
the
jordan
to
hear
the
prophet
we
had
not
ridden
a
great
way
from
the
house
when
we
overtook
two
men
on
foot
with
staves
in
their
hands
and
wallets
upon
their
shoulders
as
we
passed
one
of
them
bowed
with
respect
to
rabbi
amos
who
from
his
rank
as
a
priest
and
his
venerable
appearance
always
commands
the
homage
of
all
men
whither
goest
thou
at
such
a
pace
friend
matthew
said
rabbi
amos
returning
his
salutation
canst
thou
leave
thy
these
busy
times
to
go
into
the
wilderness
the
person
who
was
a
man
of
stout
figure
with
dark
hair
and
beard
and
a
look
of
intelligence
but
whose
costume
was
plain
and
smiled
and
answered
if
a
man
would
find
the
payers
of
tribute
nowadays
good
master
he
must
not
stay
at
home
forsooth
but
go
into
the
wilderness
of
jordan
verily
this
new
prophet
emptieth
our
towns
and
we
publicans
must
remain
idle
in
our
seat
of
customs
or
go
with
the
tide
and
thinkest
thou
continued
my
uncle
as
the
two
men
walked
along
by
the
side
of
his
mule
thinkest
thou
this
prophet
is
a
true
son
of
the
prophets
he
works
no
miracles
unless
indeed
the
power
of
his
preaching
be
a
miracle
answered
matthew
this
man
is
an
impostor
there
can
be
no
prophet
unless
he
prove
his
mission
by
miracles
suddenly
said
the
companion
of
matthew
speaking
up
abruptly
in
a
sharp
and
unpleasing
voice
now
neither
mary
nor
i
liked
the
face
of
this
man
from
the
first
he
was
low
in
height
was
and
his
attire
was
mean
but
he
had
a
suspicious
air
combined
with
a
cringing
deference
to
rabbi
amos
that
made
me
think
he
must
be
a
hypocrite
he
smiled
with
his
mouth
and
teeth
but
at
the
same
time
looked
sinister
out
of
his
eyes
an
air
of
humility
seemed
to
me
to
be
put
on
to
conceal
the
pride
and
wickedness
of
his
character
he
looked
like
a
man
who
could
artfully
deceive
to
gain
his
selfish
ends
and
who
would
kneel
to
you
to
overturn
you
the
sound
of
his
voice
confirmed
my
first
impression
of
him
upon
speaking
rabbi
amos
fixed
his
eyes
upon
him
as
if
he
did
not
like
the
manner
of
his
breaking
in
upon
the
conversation
what
is
thy
companion
name
friend
matthew
he
asked
aside
as
the
other
walked
on
ahead
his
name
is
judas
called
iscariot
he
hath
been
engaged
by
me
to
bear
the
moneys
i
collect
in
the
country
villages
and
as
we
are
to
gather
taxes
both
at
gilgal
and
bethabara
he
cometh
with
me
at
length
dear
father
after
hastening
the
speed
of
our
mules
and
riding
pleasantly
for
two
hours
along
the
verdant
banks
of
jordan
we
came
in
sight
of
a
square
tower
of
stone
peering
above
the
trees
which
marked
the
site
of
the
village
of
bethabara
that
tower
said
rabbi
amos
stands
over
a
cave
in
which
elijah
long
dwelt
from
the
summit
of
yonder
hill
at
the
left
the
prophet
was
caught
up
and
ascended
to
heaven
upon
the
chariot
of
fire
and
near
where
you
see
the
single
rock
elisha
divided
jordan
with
the
fallen
mantle
left
him
by
the
ascending
prophet
of
god
while
my
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
hill
and
my
imagination
presented
to
me
elijah
standing
upon
the
chariot
of
heaven
disappearing
amid
the
clouds
there
was
an
opening
in
the
wood
before
us
and
all
at
once
we
beheld
a
scene
that
made
my
heart
cease
to
beat
it
was
so
new
and
wonderful
near
the
place
the
winding
river
takes
a
broad
curve
and
the
opposite
village
of
bethabara
lies
in
the
hollow
of
it
forming
the
center
of
half
a
circle
this
widely
curving
shore
was
alive
with
the
human
heads
that
filled
it
and
of
this
vast
multitude
every
eye
was
concentrated
upon
the
prophet
he
was
standing
near
the
opposite
shore
the
jordan
here
is
very
narrow
and
can
be
forded
in
the
water
addressing
the
countless
assembly
that
stood
opposite
to
and
half
encircling
him
near
him
behind
and
on
either
side
sat
his
disciples
upon
the
bank
at
least
a
hundred
in
number
chiefly
young
men
the
clear
voice
of
the
youthful
prophet
of
the
wilderness
fell
distinctly
on
our
ears
so
great
was
the
stillness
of
the
vast
audience
to
my
surprise
i
saw
john
the
cousin
of
mary
standing
close
to
the
prophet
and
listening
with
the
deepest
and
most
reverent
attention
to
every
syllable
he
uttered
the
subject
of
the
discourse
was
as
before
and
as
always
the
coming
of
the
messias
oh
that
i
could
give
you
my
dear
father
the
faintest
idea
of
the
power
and
eloquence
of
his
language
do
you
ask
me
if
the
blood
of
bulls
and
goats
take
not
away
sin
i
answer
and
say
unto
you
that
the
lord
hath
said
that
he
delighteth
not
in
these
rivers
of
blood
he
continued
earnestly
for
what
then
great
prophet
asked
one
of
the
chief
levites
who
stood
near
him
for
what
then
are
the
sacrifices
ordained
by
the
law
of
moses
for
what
then
the
altar
in
the
temple
and
the
daily
sacrifice
of
the
lamb
for
what
repeated
the
prophet
with
his
eyes
beaming
with
the
earnest
light
of
inspiration
for
what
but
as
types
and
shadows
of
the
real
and
true
sacrifice
appointed
by
god
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
think
ye
a
man
can
give
the
lamb
of
his
flock
for
himself
nay
men
of
israel
the
day
has
come
when
your
eyes
shall
be
opened
the
hour
is
at
hand
when
the
true
meaning
of
the
daily
sacrifice
shall
be
understood
lo
the
messiah
cometh
and
ye
shall
see
and
believe
there
now
came
several
persons
towards
him
who
desired
baptism
while
he
was
baptizing
these
persons
both
men
and
women
i
saw
appear
on
a
little
mound
near
the
tower
lazarus
the
brother
of
martha
accompanied
by
a
man
of
about
his
own
years
of
an
indescribable
dignity
and
grace
of
aspect
combined
with
an
air
of
benevolence
and
peace
that
at
once
attracted
me
he
was
wrapped
in
a
vesture
of
dark
blue
cloth
which
was
folded
about
his
form
his
head
was
bare
and
his
hair
flowed
like
a
nazarene
down
about
his
shoulders
he
seemed
so
unlike
all
other
men
in
a
certain
majesty
united
with
sweetness
that
marked
his
whole
air
that
i
could
not
withdraw
my
gaze
from
him
the
prophet
at
the
same
moment
rested
his
eyes
upon
him
and
as
he
did
so
i
saw
a
change
come
over
his
face
as
if
he
had
seen
an
angel
his
eyes
shone
with
unearthly
brilliancy
his
lips
parted
as
if
he
would
speak
yet
had
lost
the
power
and
then
with
his
right
hand
stretched
forth
towards
the
noble
stranger
he
stood
for
a
moment
like
a
statue
all
eyes
followed
his
and
the
direction
of
his
arm
suddenly
he
exclaimed
and
oh
how
like
the
trumpet
of
horeb
his
voice
rang
behold
there
was
not
a
face
in
that
vast
multitude
that
was
not
directed
towards
the
little
eminence
ye
have
asked
wherefore
is
slain
the
daily
lamb
continued
the
prophet
the
day
has
come
when
the
lamb
of
sacrifice
which
can
take
away
no
sin
shall
cease
behold
and
here
he
stretched
forth
both
arms
towards
the
dignified
stranger
behold
him
who
taketh
away
the
transgressions
of
men
he
it
is
who
coming
after
me
is
preferred
before
me
he
it
is
to
whom
i
bear
witness
as
the
messiah
the
son
of
the
highest
there
stands
the
christ
of
god
the
only
true
lamb
whose
blood
can
take
away
the
iniquities
of
us
all
he
hath
dwelt
among
you
he
hath
walked
your
streets
he
hath
sat
in
your
homes
and
i
knew
him
not
till
i
now
behold
on
him
the
sign
of
the
messiah
when
the
prophet
had
thus
spoken
in
a
voice
that
thrilled
to
every
bosom
we
beheld
the
august
stranger
advance
towards
the
prophet
he
moved
on
alone
lazarus
had
fallen
prostrate
on
his
face
as
he
continued
to
come
forward
all
was
expectation
in
the
immense
multitude
the
mass
of
heads
swayed
this
way
and
that
to
get
a
sight
of
his
face
which
i
could
see
was
serene
but
pale
and
earnest
john
the
cousin
of
mary
seeing
him
approach
lowly
knelt
and
bowed
his
head
in
reverential
awe
and
love
those
who
stood
between
him
and
the
prophet
moved
involuntarily
apart
and
left
an
open
path
for
him
to
the
he
walked
at
a
slow
and
even
pace
with
an
air
of
humility
veiling
the
native
dignity
of
his
kingly
port
the
prophet
on
seeing
him
come
near
regarded
him
as
it
seemed
to
me
with
far
more
awe
than
all
others
what
wouldst
thou
of
thy
servant
o
messiah
prophet
of
god
mighty
to
save
he
said
in
tremulous
tones
as
the
stranger
came
even
some
paces
into
the
water
towards
him
to
be
baptized
of
thee
answered
the
christ
in
a
still
quiet
voice
that
was
heard
to
the
remotest
bounds
of
the
crowd
never
oh
never
shall
i
forget
the
sounds
of
that
voice
as
it
fell
upon
my
ears
i
have
need
to
be
baptized
of
thee
and
comest
thou
to
me
answered
the
prophet
with
the
lowliest
humility
and
awe
of
manner
and
with
looks
expressive
of
his
amazement
it
becometh
us
to
fulfill
all
righteousness
answered
messiah
mildly
and
when
he
had
said
this
the
prophet
though
still
with
a
manner
of
doubt
and
with
the
holiest
reverence
administered
then
unto
him
in
the
sight
of
all
the
people
the
like
baptism
which
he
had
administered
to
his
disciples
and
now
my
dear
father
comes
to
be
related
the
most
extraordinary
thing
that
ever
took
place
in
israel
since
the
law
was
given
from
sinai
no
sooner
did
the
baptized
stranger
go
up
out
of
the
water
than
there
was
heard
above
all
our
heads
a
noise
as
of
rolling
thunder
although
the
sky
was
cloudless
and
when
in
great
fear
we
looked
up
we
beheld
a
dazzling
glory
far
brighter
than
the
sun
and
from
the
midst
of
this
celestial
splendor
there
darted
with
arrowy
velocity
a
ray
of
light
which
descended
and
lit
upon
the
head
of
the
christ
some
of
the
people
said
it
thundered
and
others
that
it
lightened
but
judge
of
the
amazement
and
admiration
of
all
and
the
dread
awe
that
shook
every
soul
when
amid
the
glory
above
his
head
was
seen
the
form
of
a
dove
of
fire
with
outspread
wings
overshadowing
him
as
it
were
and
from
the
heavens
what
was
supposed
to
be
thunder
shaped
itself
into
a
voice
which
uttered
these
words
in
the
hearing
of
every
ear
this
is
my
beloved
son
in
whom
i
am
well
pleased
at
hearing
these
words
from
the
skies
a
great
part
of
the
multitude
fell
on
their
faces
every
cheek
was
pale
and
each
man
gazed
on
his
neighbor
in
wonder
and
fear
when
the
majestic
yet
terrible
voice
had
given
utterance
to
these
words
the
light
disappeared
the
dove
to
the
skies
and
was
lost
to
sight
leaving
a
halo
of
divine
glory
resting
upon
the
head
of
this
son
of
god
he
alone
seemed
unmoved
and
calm
amid
all
this
awful
scene
and
going
up
the
river
bank
disappeared
mysteriously
and
suddenly
from
my
earnest
gaze
at
length
when
men
came
a
little
to
themselves
and
would
gaze
on
him
whom
all
knew
now
to
be
the
christ
no
one
could
find
him
so
effectually
had
he
withdrawn
himself
from
their
homage
your
affectionate
adina
letter
x
my
dear
father
i
shall
now
resume
the
narrative
interrupted
by
the
close
of
my
last
letter
the
excitement
which
the
sudden
disappearance
of
jesus
produced
led
to
a
universal
separation
of
the
multitude
no
one
knew
whence
he
had
gone
save
john
mary
cousin
and
lazarus
who
reverently
followed
him
the
prophet
john
of
jordan
appeared
to
me
to
be
more
surprised
at
what
had
taken
place
than
any
others
he
looked
constantly
around
for
jesus
and
then
with
his
hands
clasped
together
and
uplifted
gazed
heavenward
as
if
satisfied
with
the
thousands
around
him
that
he
had
been
received
up
into
heaven
rabbi
amos
and
our
party
remained
standing
near
the
water
for
he
desired
to
speak
with
john
who
stood
alone
in
the
midst
of
the
water
precisely
where
he
had
baptized
jesus
not
one
of
his
disciples
remained
with
him
rabbi
amos
drew
near
and
said
to
him
holy
prophet
knowest
thou
what
man
if
man
he
may
be
called
was
just
baptized
by
thee
the
prophet
whose
eyes
had
been
steadfastly
raised
all
the
while
bent
his
looks
with
tearful
tenderness
upon
rabbi
amos
and
said
plaintively
and
touchingly
this
is
he
of
whom
i
spake
after
me
cometh
a
man
which
is
preferred
before
me
for
he
was
before
me
and
i
knew
him
not
but
he
that
sent
me
to
baptize
with
water
the
same
said
unto
me
upon
whom
thou
shalt
see
the
spirit
descending
and
remaining
on
him
the
same
is
he
that
baptizeth
with
the
holy
ghost
and
i
saw
the
spirit
descending
like
a
dove
and
i
saw
and
bear
record
that
this
is
the
son
of
god
and
whither
oh
holy
prophet
of
jordan
asked
rabbi
amos
with
deep
and
sacred
interest
whither
has
he
departed
that
i
know
not
he
must
increase
and
i
must
decrease
whether
he
remaineth
on
earth
or
has
been
taken
up
into
heaven
my
mission
is
now
drawing
to
its
close
for
he
to
whom
i
have
borne
witness
is
come
thus
speaking
he
turned
and
walked
out
of
the
water
on
the
side
towards
bethabara
and
disappeared
among
the
trees
that
fringed
the
bank
i
now
looked
in
the
face
of
rabbi
amos
upon
whose
arm
mary
was
tearfully
leaning
his
face
was
grave
and
thoughtful
i
said
uncle
dost
thou
believe
all
that
thou
hast
seen
and
heard
i
know
not
what
to
say
he
answered
only
that
the
things
which
i
have
beheld
this
day
are
evidences
that
god
has
not
forgotten
his
people
israel
he
said
no
more
we
left
the
banks
of
the
jordan
in
silence
and
awe
and
remounting
our
mules
returned
towards
my
house
at
gilgal
on
the
way
we
constantly
passed
crowds
of
people
all
in
high
talk
about
the
wonderful
events
which
had
taken
place
at
the
river
the
impression
seemed
universally
to
be
that
jesus
had
gone
up
into
heaven
after
he
was
baptized
but
my
dear
father
it
is
with
deep
joy
that
i
am
able
to
tell
you
that
this
wonderful
person
is
still
on
the
earth
i
stated
that
my
cousin
john
and
lazarus
had
kept
their
eyes
upon
him
from
the
first
and
that
they
had
seen
him
pass
down
the
river
where
some
projecting
and
overhanging
trees
hid
him
at
once
from
view
though
they
often
lost
sight
of
him
they
yet
followed
him
by
the
print
of
his
sandals
in
the
wet
sand
of
the
shore
and
at
length
came
in
view
of
him
as
he
was
leaving
the
river
bank
and
going
towards
the
desert
between
two
low
hills
which
hid
him
from
their
eyes
they
went
on
but
though
they
moved
forward
rapidly
they
next
saw
him
far
distant
crossing
the
arid
plain
that
stretches
south
towards
jericho
and
the
desert
they
ran
very
swiftly
and
at
length
coming
near
him
called
master
good
master
stay
for
us
for
we
would
follow
and
learn
of
thee
he
stopped
and
turned
upon
them
a
visage
so
pale
and
marred
with
sadness
and
anguish
that
they
both
stood
still
and
gazed
upon
him
with
amazement
at
beholding
such
a
change
the
glory
of
his
beauty
had
passed
away
and
the
beaming
splendor
which
shone
upon
his
countenance
was
wholly
gone
the
expression
of
unutterable
sorrow
that
remained
pierced
them
to
the
heart
lazarus
who
had
been
so
long
his
bosom
friend
wept
aloud
weep
not
thou
shalt
see
me
another
day
my
friends
he
said
i
now
go
to
the
wilderness
in
obedience
to
the
spirit
which
guideth
me
thither
thou
shalt
after
a
time
behold
me
again
it
is
expedient
for
you
that
i
go
whither
i
go
nay
but
we
will
go
with
thee
said
lazarus
earnestly
if
thou
art
to
endure
evil
we
will
be
with
thee
there
must
be
none
to
help
there
must
be
none
to
uphold
he
said
firmly
but
sadly
i
must
tread
the
winepress
of
temptation
alone
he
then
left
them
waving
his
hand
for
them
to
go
back
they
obeyed
sorrowfully
wondering
what
his
words
meant
and
wherefore
it
was
needful
for
him
to
go
into
the
desert
where
certain
mysterious
trials
seemed
to
wait
for
him
and
they
wondered
most
of
all
at
the
change
in
his
countenance
which
from
being
lustrous
with
celestial
light
was
now
said
lazarus
marred
more
than
the
sons
of
men
from
time
to
time
the
two
young
men
looked
backward
to
watch
the
receding
figure
of
the
christ
till
they
no
longer
distinguished
him
in
the
distance
of
the
desert
towards
the
dreadful
solitudes
of
which
he
steadfastly
kept
his
face
the
two
friends
came
on
to
the
house
of
rabbi
amos
at
gilgal
the
same
night
and
we
sat
together
late
at
night
upon
the
porch
under
the
fig
trees
talking
of
jesus
now
my
dear
father
how
wonderful
is
all
this
that
a
great
prophet
is
among
us
can
not
be
denied
the
star
of
john
the
baptizer
fame
dwindles
into
a
before
the
glory
of
this
son
of
god
that
he
will
draw
all
men
unto
him
even
into
the
wilderness
if
he
takes
up
his
abode
there
can
not
be
questioned
but
all
is
mystery
awe
curiosity
wonder
and
excitement
just
now
may
the
god
of
our
fathers
house
come
forth
indeed
from
the
heavens
for
the
salvation
of
his
people
your
devoted
and
loving
adina
letter
xi
my
dear
father
in
my
last
letter
to
you
i
spoke
of
our
return
from
jordan
to
gilgal
at
the
house
were
assembled
not
only
john
the
cousin
of
mary
and
the
noble
lazarus
but
also
gamaliel
and
saul
the
court
of
the
dwelling
was
thronged
with
strangers
and
the
common
people
who
being
far
from
their
homes
and
without
food
had
freely
been
invited
to
lodgings
and
food
by
the
hospitable
priest
as
we
sat
up
late
conversing
with
deep
interest
upon
the
remarkable
events
of
the
day
an
observation
made
by
john
when
speaking
of
the
change
in
the
face
of
jesus
that
his
face
was
marred
more
than
the
sons
of
men
led
the
venerable
gamaliel
to
say
to
us
those
are
the
words
of
the
prophet
esaias
and
are
truly
spoken
by
him
of
messias
when
he
shall
come
let
us
consult
esaias
then
and
see
what
further
he
hath
said
cried
rabbi
amos
mary
bring
hither
the
roll
of
the
prophets
my
cousin
mary
returned
and
placed
the
book
on
a
small
stand
before
him
read
aloud
worthy
rabbi
said
the
philosopher
gamaliel
we
will
all
listen
for
though
i
do
not
believe
this
young
man
who
was
baptized
is
messias
and
the
christ
who
is
to
restore
all
things
to
us
yet
i
am
prepared
to
reverence
him
as
a
great
prophet
and
answered
rabbi
amos
if
we
find
the
prophecies
do
meet
in
him
that
which
we
look
for
to
meet
in
messias
when
he
cometh
wilt
thou
believe
venerable
father
i
will
believe
and
reverently
adore
answered
the
sage
bowing
his
head
till
his
flowing
white
beard
almost
touched
his
knees
read
adina
for
thy
eyes
are
young
said
my
uncle
and
i
read
as
follows
my
servant
shall
deal
prudently
he
shall
be
exalted
and
extolled
and
be
very
high
as
many
were
astonished
at
thee
his
visage
was
so
marred
more
than
any
man
and
his
form
more
than
the
sons
of
men
how
completely
said
john
those
words
describe
his
appearance
on
the
verge
of
the
desert
and
yet
i
used
them
unconsciously
but
said
saul
gamaliel
disciple
if
this
be
prophesied
of
the
christ
then
we
are
to
have
a
christ
of
humiliation
and
not
one
of
honor
and
glory
read
one
part
which
you
have
omitted
maiden
i
read
on
as
follows
my
servant
shall
be
exalted
and
extolled
and
be
very
high
he
shall
sprinkle
many
nations
the
kings
shall
shut
their
mouths
at
him
he
shall
lift
up
his
hand
to
the
gentiles
and
set
up
his
standard
to
the
people
kings
shall
bow
down
to
him
with
their
faces
to
the
earth
and
lick
up
the
dust
of
his
feet
there
such
is
our
messias
exclaimed
saul
yes
it
is
a
christ
of
power
and
dominion
who
is
to
redeem
israel
added
gamaliel
not
an
unknown
young
man
scarcely
thirty
years
of
age
who
came
from
whence
no
one
knoweth
and
hath
gone
as
he
came
as
for
the
christ
we
shall
know
whence
he
cometh
at
hearing
this
great
and
good
man
thus
discourse
dear
father
my
heart
sank
within
me
for
lazarus
had
already
told
us
that
his
friend
jesus
was
of
humble
birth
a
carpenter
son
and
his
mother
a
widow
that
he
had
known
him
from
boyhood
but
known
him
only
to
love
him
i
now
looked
towards
him
but
i
took
courage
when
i
saw
that
the
words
of
gamaliel
did
not
in
the
least
dim
the
light
of
faith
and
confidence
which
brightly
sparkled
in
his
eyes
that
his
friend
jesus
was
truly
messias
of
god
but
my
eye
fell
on
what
follows
and
as
i
read
it
i
gained
more
confidence
he
hath
no
form
nor
comeliness
and
when
we
shall
see
him
there
is
no
beauty
that
we
should
desire
him
if
the
first
part
of
this
prophecy
said
lazarus
his
fine
eyes
lighting
up
as
he
looked
at
saul
be
of
the
christ
as
you
have
just
now
confessed
then
is
this
last
of
him
and
the
fact
that
you
reject
him
is
but
the
fulfillment
of
this
part
of
the
prophecy
hereupon
arose
a
very
warm
discussion
between
gamaliel
and
saul
on
one
side
and
rabbi
amos
john
and
lazarus
on
the
other
but
let
this
be
as
it
may
said
john
after
the
arguments
on
both
sides
had
been
mainly
exhausted
how
will
you
o
gamaliel
and
you
saul
get
over
the
extraordinary
voice
and
fiery
appearance
which
distinguished
the
baptism
that
must
have
been
a
phenomenon
of
nature
or
done
by
the
art
of
the
famed
babylonish
sorcerer
whom
i
saw
prominent
in
the
multitude
answered
the
philosopher
did
you
not
hear
the
words
asked
rabbi
amos
yes
rabbi
nevertheless
they
may
have
been
thrown
into
the
air
from
the
lungs
of
this
sorcerer
for
they
do
marvelous
things
would
you
suppose
that
a
sorcerer
would
be
disposed
to
apply
the
sacred
words
of
the
lord
asked
john
earnestly
by
no
means
he
answered
reverently
if
rabbi
amos
will
allow
me
i
will
show
you
the
very
words
in
king
david
prophecies
of
messias
all
looked
with
interest
on
john
as
he
took
from
his
mantle
a
roll
of
the
psalms
he
opened
it
and
read
as
follows
do
the
rulers
take
counsel
together
against
the
lord
and
against
his
anointed
i
will
declare
the
decree
the
lord
hath
said
unto
me
thou
art
my
son
upon
hearing
this
read
gamaliel
was
thoughtful
it
is
extraordinary
answered
he
i
will
search
the
scriptures
when
i
reach
jerusalem
to
see
if
these
things
be
so
but
said
saul
with
some
vehemence
listen
while
i
read
some
prophecies
also
and
he
unrolled
the
book
of
the
prophets
and
read
these
words
bethlehem
ephratah
though
thou
be
little
among
the
thousands
of
judah
yet
out
of
thee
shall
he
come
forth
unto
me
that
is
to
be
ruler
in
israel
whose
goings
forth
have
been
from
of
old
from
everlasting
now
you
will
confess
rabbi
amos
he
added
with
a
look
of
triumph
that
this
word
refers
to
our
expected
messias
without
doubt
answered
my
uncle
but
wait
i
beseech
you
learned
rabbi
said
saul
until
i
read
you
another
prophecy
and
he
read
have
made
a
covenant
with
david
thy
seed
will
i
establish
forever
and
build
up
thy
throne
to
all
generations
his
seed
shall
endure
forever
and
his
throne
as
the
sun
before
me
behold
the
days
come
saith
the
lord
that
i
will
raise
unto
david
a
righteous
branch
now
you
will
all
admit
brethren
that
these
prophecies
refer
to
messias
he
is
therefore
to
come
of
the
lineage
of
david
and
he
is
to
be
born
in
bethlehem
show
me
that
this
jesus
the
nazarene
fulfills
both
conditions
in
his
own
person
and
i
will
prepare
to
believe
in
him
this
was
said
haughtily
and
with
the
air
of
one
who
can
not
be
answered
but
immediately
lazarus
rose
to
his
feet
and
said
although
i
did
not
recollect
this
prophecy
that
christ
was
to
be
born
in
bethlehem
yet
i
am
overjoyed
to
find
the
fact
respecting
jesus
fulfills
it
he
was
born
in
bethlehem
of
judah
this
i
have
known
some
years
and
here
while
my
heart
was
bounding
with
joy
gamaliel
said
sternly
i
thought
this
man
was
born
in
nazareth
he
has
lived
answered
lazarus
in
nazareth
from
childhood
only
during
the
days
when
cæsar
augustus
issued
a
decree
that
all
the
world
should
be
taxed
his
mother
and
joseph
her
husband
went
up
to
the
city
of
david
to
be
taxed
which
is
bethlehem
and
there
jesus
was
born
as
i
have
often
heard
from
her
lips
admitting
then
that
he
was
born
in
bethlehem
said
saul
you
have
to
prove
his
lineage
from
david
line
wherefore
did
his
parents
go
to
bethlehem
david
city
unless
they
were
of
his
royal
line
asked
rabbi
amos
for
none
went
to
any
other
city
to
be
taxed
than
that
of
their
own
family
the
fact
that
they
went
there
is
strong
evidence
that
they
were
of
david
house
every
one
born
in
the
city
of
david
remarked
gamaliel
is
not
of
necessity
of
david
house
but
it
is
surprising
if
this
jesus
really
was
born
in
bethlehem
but
may
not
his
lineage
be
ascertained
without
a
doubt
from
the
records
of
the
tribes
and
of
their
families
kept
by
command
of
the
law
of
the
temple
i
asked
of
my
uncle
without
question
these
books
of
the
generations
of
our
people
are
to
be
relied
on
he
answered
in
fact
said
gamaliel
they
are
kept
with
the
greatest
accuracy
and
it
is
so
ordained
by
god
for
the
very
reason
that
when
messias
cometh
we
may
know
whether
he
who
claims
to
be
such
be
of
the
house
of
david
or
no
i
will
examine
the
book
of
the
generations
and
see
if
his
mother
and
father
come
of
the
stock
and
seed
of
david
and
if
you
find
that
they
do
asked
john
with
emotion
can
you
doubt
any
longer
whether
jesus
be
the
christ
will
not
the
fact
of
his
being
born
in
bethlehem
and
of
the
lineage
of
david
not
to
speak
of
the
witness
of
god
own
audible
voice
heard
by
our
ears
this
day
will
not
these
facts
lead
you
to
believe
that
he
is
the
christ
they
will
prevent
me
from
actually
rejecting
him
answered
the
cold
philosopher
but
every
child
born
in
bethlehem
and
of
the
house
of
david
and
there
are
many
of
them
in
judah
fulfills
so
far
the
conditions
of
these
two
prophecies
these
are
not
therefore
messiahs
what
more
can
you
ask
for
asked
mary
with
feeling
for
she
strongly
believed
that
jesus
was
the
christ
miracles
answered
the
disciple
of
gamaliel
glancing
at
the
face
of
his
master
inquiringly
yes
miracles
also
answered
the
sage
the
messiah
is
to
heal
the
sick
by
a
word
restore
sight
to
the
blind
cast
out
devils
and
even
raise
the
dead
if
he
restore
the
blind
and
raise
the
dead
i
will
doubt
no
longer
answered
saul
there
was
at
this
moment
an
interruption
caused
by
noisy
altercations
in
the
court
among
some
of
john
the
baptist
disciples
rabbi
amos
as
host
went
out
to
put
an
end
to
these
disputings
when
gamaliel
retired
to
his
chamber
and
the
conversation
was
not
renewed
your
daughter
adina
letter
xii
my
dear
father
let
me
resume
the
interesting
subject
of
which
my
letters
have
been
so
full
it
is
now
eight
weeks
since
our
return
from
gilgal
for
five
weeks
after
we
reached
jerusalem
we
heard
nothing
of
jesus
until
john
son
of
elisaph
reappeared
he
and
lazarus
came
into
the
city
together
and
to
the
house
of
rabbi
amos
our
first
inquiry
was
have
you
seen
him
have
you
heard
anything
from
him
john
has
seen
him
answered
lazarus
seriously
ask
him
and
he
will
tell
you
all
we
looked
at
john
who
sat
sad
and
pensive
as
if
he
were
dwelling
in
his
mind
upon
some
painful
yet
tender
sorrow
the
eyes
of
my
cousin
mary
which
always
caught
their
lustre
from
his
were
shaded
with
an
inquiring
look
of
sympathy
and
solicitude
you
are
not
well
i
fear
she
said
placing
her
fair
hand
upon
his
white
brow
and
putting
back
the
hair
from
his
temples
you
have
been
long
away
and
are
weary
and
weary
mary
i
shall
never
complain
of
weariness
again
after
what
i
have
beheld
what
have
you
seen
i
asked
jesus
in
the
desert
and
when
i
remember
him
there
i
shall
forget
to
smile
more
you
have
found
him
then
i
eagerly
asked
yes
after
days
of
painful
search
i
found
him
in
the
very
center
of
the
desert
of
ashes
where
foot
of
man
had
never
trodden
before
i
saw
him
upon
his
knees
and
heard
his
voice
in
prayer
i
laid
down
the
sack
of
bread
and
fishes
and
the
skin
of
water
i
had
brought
with
me
to
succor
him
and
with
awe
drew
near
where
he
stood
as
i
came
closer
to
him
i
heard
him
groan
in
spirit
and
he
seemed
to
be
borne
down
to
the
earth
by
some
mortal
agony
he
was
as
it
were
talking
to
some
invisible
evil
beings
who
assailed
him
good
master
i
said
have
brought
thee
food
and
water
pardon
me
if
i
have
intruded
upon
thy
awful
loneliness
which
is
sacred
to
some
deep
grief
but
i
weep
with
thee
for
thy
woes
and
in
all
thy
afflictions
i
am
afflicted
eat
that
thou
mayest
have
strength
to
endure
thy
mysterious
sufferings
he
turned
his
pale
countenance
full
upon
me
and
extended
towards
me
his
emaciated
hands
while
he
smiled
faintly
and
blessed
me
and
said
thou
art
very
dear
to
me
thou
shalt
one
day
be
afflicted
for
me
but
not
now
and
then
understand
wherefore
i
am
now
a
sufferer
in
the
desert
me
remain
with
thee
divine
messias
i
said
believest
then
that
i
am
he
he
answered
regarding
me
with
love
i
replied
by
casting
myself
at
his
feet
and
bathing
them
with
my
tears
he
raised
me
and
said
thy
way
presently
when
the
time
of
my
fasting
and
temptation
is
past
i
will
see
thee
again
i
will
not
leave
thee
i
asserted
thou
lovest
me
beloved
thou
wilt
obey
me
he
answered
with
a
tone
of
gentle
reproof
thou
wilt
first
eat
of
the
bread
i
have
brought
and
drink
of
the
water
i
entreated
knowest
not
what
temptation
thou
art
offering
to
me
he
replied
sadly
hast
not
enough
for
thine
own
needs
go
and
leave
me
to
gain
the
victory
over
satan
the
prince
of
this
world
for
which
i
was
led
by
the
spirit
thither
i
once
more
cast
myself
at
his
feet
and
he
lifted
me
up
kissing
me
and
sent
me
away
oh
you
would
not
have
known
him
worn
and
emaciated
by
long
abstinence
weak
through
suffering
he
looked
but
the
shadow
of
himself
he
could
not
have
lived
thus
if
there
had
not
been
a
divine
power
within
to
sustain
him
his
existence
so
long
for
he
had
been
in
the
desert
five
weeks
without
food
when
i
found
him
was
a
miracle
in
itself
proving
the
power
of
god
to
be
in
him
for
what
mighty
work
among
men
is
god
preparing
him
said
rabbi
amos
with
emotion
surely
he
is
a
prophet
come
from
god
think
you
he
still
lives
i
asked
with
anxious
fears
scarcely
trusting
my
voice
above
a
whisper
yes
answered
john
i
am
come
to
tell
you
he
was
divinely
sustained
through
all
and
after
forty
days
he
came
forth
from
the
wilderness
and
suddenly
presented
himself
on
the
banks
of
jordan
among
disciples
i
was
standing
near
the
baptizer
discoursing
of
the
christ
and
marvelling
when
his
exile
to
the
desert
would
terminate
when
the
prophet
lifting
his
eyes
cried
with
a
loud
voice
full
of
joy
again
the
lamb
of
god
upon
whom
the
spirit
of
god
descended
he
hath
come
from
the
furnace
like
gold
seven
times
tried
in
the
fire
he
it
is
who
alone
taketh
away
the
sins
of
the
world
i
turned
and
beheld
jesus
advancing
he
was
pale
and
wore
an
expression
of
gentle
uncomplaining
suffering
on
his
benign
and
spiritualized
countenance
i
hastened
to
meet
him
and
was
kneeling
in
joy
at
his
feet
when
he
embraced
me
as
a
brother
and
said
and
full
of
love
wilt
thou
follow
me
will
nevermore
leave
thee
i
answered
dwellest
thou
divine
master
then
asked
one
of
disciples
andrew
by
name
who
was
with
me
my
friends
and
see
he
answered
and
we
went
after
him
with
joy
unutterable
he
entered
the
village
of
bethabara
and
approaching
the
house
of
a
widow
where
he
abode
went
in
we
followed
him
and
by
his
request
took
up
our
abode
with
him
oh
how
shall
i
be
able
to
make
known
by
words
added
john
the
sweet
expression
of
his
discourse
in
one
day
in
his
presence
i
grew
wise
his
words
filled
the
soul
like
new
wine
and
made
the
heart
glad
the
next
day
he
wished
to
go
into
galilee
and
so
on
to
nazareth
where
his
mother
dwelleth
and
as
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
follow
him
as
his
disciple
henceforth
i
have
only
come
hither
to
make
known
my
purpose
to
mary
and
to
arrange
my
affairs
in
the
city
i
will
leave
again
to
join
this
my
dear
lord
at
cana
of
galilee
canst
thou
divine
at
all
his
purpose
asked
rabbi
amos
of
john
whether
he
intends
to
found
a
school
of
wisdom
to
preach
like
the
prophets
to
reign
like
david
or
to
conquer
like
his
warrior
namesake
joshua
i
know
not
save
that
he
said
he
came
to
redeem
that
which
was
lost
and
to
establish
a
kingdom
that
shall
have
no
end
upon
hearing
this
all
our
hearts
bounded
with
hope
and
confidence
in
him
and
we
all
together
burst
forth
into
a
voice
of
thanksgiving
and
sang
this
hymn
of
praise
o
sing
unto
the
lord
a
new
song
he
hath
done
marvelous
things
his
right
hand
and
his
holy
arm
hath
gotten
the
victory
the
lord
hath
made
known
his
salvation
his
righteousness
hath
he
openly
shewed
in
the
sight
of
the
heathen
he
hath
remembered
his
mercy
and
his
truth
towards
the
house
of
israel
all
the
ends
of
the
earth
have
seen
the
salvation
of
our
god
there
was
this
morning
dear
father
no
little
excitement
produced
among
the
chief
priests
by
a
formal
inquiry
sent
by
pilate
to
caiaphas
the
high
priest
asking
whether
this
new
prophet
was
to
be
acknowledged
by
them
as
their
messiah
for
if
he
is
to
be
it
will
be
my
duty
said
the
governor
to
place
him
under
arrest
inasmuch
as
we
understand
the
jewish
messias
is
to
declare
himself
king
upon
this
there
was
a
tumultuous
assembling
together
of
the
priests
in
the
porch
of
the
temple
and
with
many
invectives
they
agreed
to
send
answer
to
pilate
that
they
did
not
acknowledge
jesus
of
nazareth
to
be
the
christ
what
pilate
will
conclude
to
do
i
know
not
rabbi
amos
informed
us
that
the
procurator
had
got
some
news
by
courier
that
morning
that
jesus
on
his
way
to
cana
had
been
followed
by
a
full
thousand
people
who
hailed
him
as
the
christ
thus
you
see
my
dear
father
that
this
divine
person
is
already
taking
hold
of
the
hearts
of
the
people
and
arousing
the
jealousy
of
our
enemies
be
assured
that
the
day
will
come
when
he
will
lift
up
his
standard
to
the
gentiles
and
draw
all
men
unto
him
your
loving
adina
letter
xiii
my
dear
father
since
i
last
wrote
you
my
faith
has
been
confirmed
by
the
testimony
which
in
one
of
your
letters
you
demanded
you
said
let
me
hear
that
he
has
done
an
authentic
miracle
in
attestation
of
the
divinity
of
his
mission
such
a
miracle
as
was
prophesied
messias
shall
do
as
healing
the
sick
by
a
word
restoring
the
blind
to
sight
and
raising
the
dead
and
i
will
prepare
to
believe
in
him
miracle
he
has
performed
dear
father
and
one
the
genuineness
of
which
is
not
disputed
by
any
one
i
can
give
you
the
particulars
best
by
extracting
from
a
letter
written
by
john
to
mary
a
few
days
after
his
departure
to
join
jesus
at
nazareth
upon
reaching
nazareth
says
the
letter
i
was
guided
to
the
humble
dwelling
occupied
by
the
mother
of
jesus
by
a
large
concourse
of
people
gathered
about
it
of
whom
inquiring
i
learned
that
it
was
to
see
the
new
prophet
they
had
thus
assembled
new
prophet
i
asked
wishing
to
know
what
the
multitude
thought
of
jesus
one
of
whom
john
of
the
wilderness
foretold
answered
one
say
he
is
messias
replied
another
is
the
christ
boldly
asserted
a
third
hereupon
a
levite
standing
by
said
scornfully
christ
come
out
of
the
country
of
galilee
you
read
the
prophets
to
little
purpose
if
you
see
therein
any
christ
prophesied
to
come
out
of
nazareth
of
galilee
hereupon
seeing
the
faith
of
many
staggered
i
said
christ
is
truly
to
be
of
bethlehem
and
verily
jesus
though
now
he
dwelleth
in
this
place
was
born
in
bethlehem
canst
not
prove
it
man
said
the
levite
angrily
stranger
speaketh
truly
spoke
up
both
an
old
man
and
a
woman
in
the
crowd
know
that
he
was
not
born
here
and
that
when
his
parents
moved
hither
when
he
was
an
infant
they
then
said
he
was
born
in
bethlehem
we
all
remember
this
well
hereupon
the
levite
seeing
that
he
had
not
the
people
with
him
passed
on
his
way
while
i
went
to
the
door
of
the
house
where
jesus
dwelt
with
his
mother
there
were
two
doors
one
of
which
led
into
a
workshop
where
i
noticed
the
bench
and
tools
of
the
occupation
at
which
he
had
toiled
to
support
himself
and
his
mother
but
when
as
i
entered
the
dwelling
i
saw
him
standing
teaching
those
who
hung
on
his
lips
and
listened
to
his
calm
voice
and
heard
the
sublime
wisdom
of
his
instructions
beheld
the
dignity
of
his
aspect
and
felt
the
heavenly
benignity
of
his
manner
i
forgot
the
carpenter
i
forgot
the
man
and
seemed
to
behold
in
him
only
messiah
the
prince
the
son
of
god
upon
beholding
me
he
extended
his
hand
and
received
me
graciously
and
said
pointing
to
five
men
who
stood
near
him
regarding
him
with
mingled
love
and
reverence
are
thy
brethren
who
have
also
come
out
of
the
world
to
follow
me
of
these
one
was
andrew
who
had
been
as
well
as
myself
disciple
another
was
andrew
brother
whose
name
is
simon
whom
jesus
from
the
firmness
and
immovable
zeal
of
his
character
which
he
seemed
to
understand
called
also
peter
or
stone
the
fourth
disciple
was
of
bethsaida
his
name
was
philip
and
he
followed
jesus
from
having
been
prepared
by
john
the
baptist
to
receive
him
he
was
moreover
so
overjoyed
at
finding
the
christ
that
he
ran
to
the
house
of
his
kinsman
nathaniel
and
finding
him
in
his
garden
beneath
a
fig
tree
at
prayer
exclaimed
have
found
him
of
whom
moses
in
the
law
and
the
prophets
did
write
the
messias
of
god
is
he
that
i
may
behold
him
asked
his
relative
rising
is
jesus
of
nazareth
the
son
of
joseph
philip
answered
upon
hearing
this
answer
the
countenance
of
nathaniel
fell
and
he
replied
there
any
good
thing
come
out
of
nazareth
thou
and
see
for
thyself
answered
philip
nathaniel
then
went
with
him
where
jesus
was
when
jesus
saw
him
approaching
he
said
to
those
about
him
an
israelite
indeed
in
whom
there
is
no
guile
knowest
thou
me
asked
nathaniel
with
surprise
for
he
had
heard
the
words
which
were
spoken
jesus
answered
and
said
philip
called
thee
when
thou
wast
under
the
fig
tree
i
saw
thee
upon
hearing
this
nathaniel
who
knew
that
he
was
all
alone
in
his
garden
and
unseen
at
prayer
when
his
brother
came
regarded
the
serene
face
of
jesus
steadfastly
and
then
as
if
he
beheld
therein
the
expression
of
omnipresence
he
cried
before
all
the
people
thou
art
the
son
of
god
thou
art
the
king
of
israel
jesus
looked
upon
him
as
if
pleased
at
his
confession
and
said
i
said
unto
thee
i
saw
thee
under
the
fig
tree
believest
thou
thou
shalt
see
greater
things
than
these
verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
hereafter
ye
shall
see
heaven
open
and
the
angels
of
god
ascending
and
descending
upon
the
son
of
man
the
next
day
james
my
brother
and
i
went
to
the
sea
of
tiberias
but
two
hours
distant
to
see
our
father
zebedee
and
transfer
our
interests
to
him
and
during
the
afternoon
jesus
passed
near
the
shore
on
his
way
to
cana
when
calling
us
we
forever
left
our
ships
and
our
father
and
joined
him
his
mother
and
many
of
her
kinsfolk
were
of
the
company
all
going
to
a
marriage
of
the
cousin
of
the
family
upon
our
arrival
at
cana
we
were
ushered
into
the
guest
chamber
the
marriage
feast
at
length
commenced
the
wine
which
should
have
come
from
damascus
had
not
arrived
the
caravan
having
been
delayed
by
the
insurrection
near
cesarea
and
the
chief
ruler
of
the
town
presiding
at
the
feast
seeing
that
the
wine
had
given
out
bade
the
servants
to
place
more
upon
the
board
the
mother
of
jesus
who
knew
that
the
wine
was
out
and
that
looking
upon
this
as
an
ill
omen
the
family
of
the
bride
were
in
great
distress
turned
to
jesus
and
said
have
no
wine
the
holy
prophet
of
god
looked
grave
and
said
applying
to
her
the
title
which
we
deem
most
honorable
of
all
others
what
have
i
to
do
with
thee
mine
hour
is
not
yet
come
she
must
have
understood
his
words
all
mysterious
as
they
were
to
me
for
turning
to
the
servants
she
beckoned
to
them
while
her
cheek
borrowed
a
rich
color
from
her
hidden
joy
and
her
eyes
kindled
with
loving
sympathy
for
those
about
to
be
relieved
in
their
distress
when
two
or
three
of
the
servants
had
approached
she
said
to
them
he
saith
unto
you
do
it
the
face
of
jesus
ever
calm
and
dignified
now
seemed
to
assume
a
look
of
majesty
inexpressible
and
his
eyes
to
express
a
certain
consciousness
of
power
within
that
awed
me
casting
his
glance
upon
several
stone
vases
which
stood
by
the
door
empty
he
said
to
the
servants
the
water
pots
with
water
in
the
court
in
full
sight
from
the
table
was
a
well
to
which
the
servants
forthwith
went
with
jars
which
i
saw
them
fill
with
water
bear
it
in
upon
their
heads
and
pour
it
out
into
the
water
pots
until
they
had
filled
them
all
to
the
brim
in
the
meantime
the
governor
of
the
feast
and
the
majority
of
the
guests
were
absorbed
in
conversation
and
did
not
observe
what
was
taking
place
out
now
and
bear
unto
the
governor
of
the
feast
said
jesus
to
the
servants
they
obeyed
and
pouring
rich
wine
from
the
jars
which
i
and
others
had
seen
filled
up
with
simple
water
from
the
well
the
amazed
servants
bore
it
to
the
chief
of
the
feast
he
had
no
sooner
filled
his
goblet
and
tasted
it
than
he
called
to
the
bridegroom
who
sat
in
the
middle
of
the
table
and
said
man
at
the
beginning
doth
set
forth
good
wine
and
when
men
have
well
drunk
then
that
which
is
worse
but
thou
hast
kept
the
good
wine
until
now
hath
brought
this
wine
asked
the
bridegroom
drinking
of
the
water
that
was
made
wine
it
came
sir
i
know
not
then
the
servants
and
others
told
that
they
had
filled
the
six
water
pots
with
water
to
the
brim
at
the
command
of
jesus
the
prophet
and
that
when
they
drew
out
behold
it
flowed
forth
wine
instead
of
water
upon
this
there
was
a
general
exclamation
of
surprise
and
the
governor
of
the
feast
crying
out
great
prophet
indeed
hath
been
among
us
and
we
knew
it
not
rose
to
approach
and
do
honor
to
jesus
but
he
had
already
conveyed
himself
away
at
once
rising
and
passing
out
through
the
door
and
seeking
the
solitude
of
the
gardens
the
rumor
of
the
miracle
at
cana
has
reached
jerusalem
since
i
began
this
letter
and
i
hear
that
it
has
produced
no
little
excitement
in
the
and
courts
of
the
temple
rabbi
amos
on
his
return
from
sacrifice
a
few
minutes
ago
said
that
he
saw
in
the
court
of
the
temple
more
than
thirty
priests
with
rolls
of
the
prophets
in
their
hands
engaged
in
looking
up
the
prophecies
of
the
christ
your
affectionate
daughter
adina
letter
xiv
my
dear
father
you
will
not
require
the
testimony
of
my
letters
to
enable
you
to
appreciate
the
fame
of
the
wonderful
young
man
of
nazareth
jesus
of
whose
works
you
must
have
heard
ere
this
his
fame
for
wisdom
for
knowledge
of
the
scriptures
for
power
to
teach
and
for
miracles
has
gone
abroad
through
all
syria
so
that
they
bring
to
him
sick
persons
both
rich
and
poor
even
from
damascus
to
be
healed
of
him
and
he
heals
all
who
are
brought
unto
him
whether
possessed
of
devils
lunatic
or
having
the
palsy
while
i
now
write
a
company
is
passing
the
open
window
bearing
upon
beds
two
wealthy
men
of
jerusalem
given
over
by
their
physicians
who
are
going
to
him
to
be
cured
so
great
is
the
multitude
which
everywhere
follows
jesus
writes
john
to
mary
that
he
is
often
compelled
to
withdraw
from
them
by
stealth
to
get
to
some
of
quiet
where
he
can
refresh
his
wearied
strength
for
a
few
days
at
such
times
we
who
are
his
immediate
followers
have
the
benefit
of
his
teaching
and
private
instructions
but
he
can
not
remain
long
away
from
the
people
they
soon
penetrate
his
retirement
how
wonderful
is
he
who
thus
holds
in
his
hands
divine
power
the
authority
of
kings
is
nothing
before
that
which
he
possesses
in
his
voice
yet
he
is
serene
humble
oh
how
humble
to
our
shame
and
always
calm
and
gentle
he
spends
much
time
in
private
prayer
to
god
whom
he
always
addresses
as
his
father
never
was
such
a
man
on
earth
we
who
know
him
most
intimately
stand
most
in
awe
of
him
yet
with
our
deep
reverence
for
his
holy
character
is
combined
the
purest
affection
in
one
and
the
same
breath
i
feel
that
i
adore
him
as
my
lord
and
love
him
even
as
my
brother
so
we
all
feel
toward
him
such
my
dear
father
is
the
tenor
of
all
john
letters
when
we
shall
see
jesus
at
jerusalem
i
shall
be
able
from
personal
observation
to
write
to
you
more
particularly
concerning
his
doctrines
and
miracles
what
is
also
of
importance
it
has
been
proven
by
the
results
of
the
examination
made
by
some
of
the
scribes
of
the
temple
that
he
was
truly
born
in
bethlehem
and
that
both
his
mother
mary
and
joseph
her
husband
are
lineal
descendants
of
the
house
of
david
moreover
phineas
the
venerable
priest
whom
you
know
hath
borne
testimony
to
the
fact
that
when
jesus
was
an
infant
during
the
reign
of
the
elder
herod
there
arrived
in
jerusalem
three
eminent
princes
men
of
wisdom
and
learning
one
of
these
came
from
persia
one
from
the
grecian
province
of
media
and
one
from
arabia
and
brought
with
them
gifts
of
gold
and
spices
and
were
attended
by
retinues
these
three
princes
reached
jerusalem
the
same
day
by
three
different
ways
and
entered
by
three
different
gates
each
unknowing
to
the
other
presence
or
object
till
they
met
in
the
city
before
herod
palace
one
represented
himself
descended
from
shem
another
from
japhet
the
third
from
ham
and
they
mysteriously
it
is
said
typified
all
the
races
of
the
earth
who
by
them
recognized
and
adored
the
savior
of
men
in
the
child
jesus
the
king
hearing
that
these
three
strangers
had
arrived
in
jerusalem
sent
to
know
wherefore
they
had
honored
his
kingdom
with
a
visit
they
answered
says
phineas
that
they
came
to
do
homage
to
the
young
prince
who
was
born
king
of
the
jews
and
when
herod
asked
what
prince
they
spoke
of
they
answered
we
have
seen
his
star
in
the
east
and
are
come
to
worship
him
hereupon
says
phineas
the
king
issued
an
edict
for
all
the
chief
priests
and
scribes
of
the
people
to
assemble
in
the
council
chamber
of
his
palace
he
then
addressed
them
to
whom
is
given
the
care
of
the
books
of
the
law
and
the
prophets
whose
study
they
are
and
in
whom
lies
the
skill
to
interpret
the
prophecies
search
therein
and
tell
me
truly
where
the
christ
is
to
be
born
behold
here
present
these
august
and
wise
men
who
have
come
from
afar
to
do
him
homage
nay
more
as
they
aver
to
worship
him
as
god
let
us
have
the
courtesy
to
give
them
the
answer
that
they
seek
and
let
us
not
be
found
more
ignorant
of
these
things
than
those
who
dwell
in
other
lands
several
of
the
chief
priests
then
rose
and
said
is
known
o
king
to
all
who
are
jews
and
who
read
the
prophets
that
messias
cometh
of
the
house
of
david
of
the
town
of
bethlehem
for
thus
it
is
written
by
the
prophet
and
thou
bethlehem
in
the
land
of
judah
art
not
least
among
the
princes
of
judah
for
out
of
thee
shall
come
a
governor
that
shall
rule
my
people
israel
this
question
being
thus
decided
continued
phineas
herod
dismissed
the
council
and
retiring
to
his
own
private
room
secretly
sent
to
the
three
princes
of
the
east
to
inquire
of
them
what
time
the
star
appeared
he
then
said
to
them
have
my
permission
noble
strangers
to
go
to
bethlehem
and
search
for
the
young
child
and
when
ye
have
found
him
bring
me
word
again
that
i
may
come
and
worship
him
also
then
they
left
the
presence
of
herod
and
it
being
dark
when
they
left
the
palace
they
were
overjoyed
to
behold
the
star
which
they
saw
in
the
east
going
before
them
they
followed
it
until
it
left
jerusalem
by
the
bethlehem
gate
and
it
led
them
on
to
the
town
of
bethlehem
and
stopped
above
an
humble
dwelling
therein
when
they
were
come
into
the
house
they
saw
the
rays
of
the
star
resting
upon
the
head
of
an
infant
in
the
arms
of
its
mother
mary
the
wife
of
joseph
they
at
once
acknowledged
and
hailed
him
as
prince
and
king
of
israel
and
falling
down
worshiped
him
and
opening
their
treasures
they
presented
unto
him
gold
frankincense
and
myrrh
gifts
that
are
offered
on
the
altar
to
god
alone
when
phineas
was
asked
by
caiaphas
how
he
knew
this
fact
he
answered
that
he
himself
prompted
by
curiosity
to
see
the
prince
they
had
come
to
worship
had
followed
them
out
of
the
palace
of
herod
out
of
the
gate
and
even
into
bethlehem
and
witnessed
their
prostrations
and
offerings
to
the
infant
child
of
mary
and
he
added
if
this
be
doubted
there
are
many
jews
now
living
in
jerusalem
and
a
certain
hebrew
captain
now
stricken
in
years
who
can
testify
to
the
slaughter
by
herod
command
of
the
infants
of
bethlehem
for
this
captain
jeremias
led
on
the
soldiers
and
wherefore
this
slaughter
asked
caiaphas
it
is
not
on
record
kings
do
not
record
their
deeds
of
violence
answered
phineas
herod
kept
it
hushed
up
when
he
found
that
he
gained
nothing
by
it
but
hatred
he
slew
them
in
order
that
the
infant
jesus
might
be
destroyed
among
them
for
the
three
wise
men
instead
of
returning
through
jerusalem
to
their
own
country
and
informing
him
where
they
had
found
the
child
departed
by
another
way
but
the
child
escaped
doubtless
by
god
powerful
protection
dost
thou
believe
in
him
also
asked
caiaphas
with
angry
surprise
looking
sternly
on
phineas
i
will
first
see
and
hear
him
speak
and
if
he
be
proven
to
me
to
be
messias
i
will
gladly
worship
him
hereupon
said
rabbi
amos
there
arose
a
great
uproar
some
crying
that
jesus
was
the
christ
and
others
that
phineas
should
be
stoned
to
death
thus
you
see
my
dear
father
how
the
evidence
increases
in
value
and
importance
proving
jesus
to
be
the
messiah
tell
me
is
not
this
the
christ
your
affectionate
and
loving
adina
letter
xv
my
dear
father
the
inquiry
you
made
in
your
last
letter
what
hath
become
of
the
prophet
of
jordan
since
the
fame
of
jesus
hath
so
eclipsed
his
own
i
can
answer
but
with
sadness
the
mission
on
which
john
came
terminated
when
jesus
came
soon
afterwards
he
left
the
wilderness
and
entered
jericho
where
herod
chanced
to
be
visiting
here
he
preached
in
the
public
places
and
in
the
market
and
on
the
very
steps
of
the
governor
palace
now
while
he
was
thus
speaking
to
the
people
and
the
officers
and
soldiers
of
the
tetrarch
guard
herod
himself
came
forth
upon
the
balcony
to
listen
the
prophet
no
sooner
beheld
him
than
he
boldly
addressed
him
and
sternly
reproved
him
for
the
sin
of
having
married
the
wife
of
his
brother
philip
contrary
to
the
law
now
herod
it
is
said
did
not
show
resentment
at
his
plain
dealings
but
inviting
the
prophet
into
his
hall
talked
much
with
him
and
in
parting
offered
him
gifts
which
john
refused
to
touch
the
next
day
he
sent
for
him
again
to
ask
him
some
questions
touching
the
messias
of
whom
he
preached
now
herodia
when
it
was
reported
to
her
after
the
return
of
herod
from
jericho
to
his
tetrarchy
how
that
the
prophet
had
publicly
spoken
against
her
marriage
with
herod
became
very
angry
and
when
she
found
that
john
was
still
favored
by
her
husband
she
sent
for
herod
and
said
that
if
he
would
please
her
he
must
throw
the
prophet
of
jordan
into
prison
at
length
herod
yielded
against
his
own
will
and
gave
orders
for
the
arrest
of
the
prophet
who
the
same
night
was
thrown
into
the
ward
of
the
castle
for
some
weeks
this
holy
man
whose
only
offense
was
that
he
had
the
courage
to
reprove
sin
in
high
places
remained
in
bonds
while
herod
each
day
sought
to
find
some
excuse
for
releasing
him
without
displeasing
herodia
of
whose
anger
he
stood
in
great
fear
being
an
abject
slave
to
his
love
for
her
at
length
the
birthday
of
herod
arrived
and
he
conveyed
word
to
john
that
in
honor
of
the
day
he
would
send
and
fetch
him
out
of
prison
as
soon
as
he
should
obtain
the
consent
of
his
wife
which
he
believed
she
would
accord
to
him
on
such
an
anniversary
now
after
the
feast
philippa
the
daughter
of
herodia
and
of
her
former
husband
philip
came
in
and
danced
before
prince
herod
and
being
beautiful
in
person
and
full
of
grace
in
every
motion
she
so
pleased
her
that
he
made
a
great
oath
having
drunk
much
wine
with
his
guests
that
he
would
give
her
whatsoever
she
would
ask
were
it
the
half
of
his
kingdom
her
mother
then
called
her
and
whispered
to
her
imperatively
give
me
said
the
maiden
turning
towards
herod
the
head
now
of
john
the
baptist
in
a
charger
the
tetrarch
no
sooner
heard
this
request
than
he
turned
pale
and
said
fiercely
thy
mother
hath
been
tampering
with
thine
ears
girl
ask
half
of
my
kingdom
and
i
will
give
it
thee
but
let
me
not
shed
blood
on
my
birthday
wilt
thou
falsify
thine
oath
asked
his
wife
scornfully
for
mine
oath
sake
and
for
those
who
have
heard
it
i
will
grant
thy
desire
he
at
length
answered
with
a
sigh
of
regret
and
he
then
turned
to
the
captain
of
the
guard
and
commanded
him
to
slay
john
baptist
in
prison
and
bring
presently
there
his
head
upon
a
charger
at
the
end
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
which
was
passed
by
herod
in
great
excitement
walking
up
and
down
the
floor
and
by
his
guests
in
silent
expectation
the
door
opened
and
the
captain
of
the
guard
entered
followed
by
the
executioner
who
carried
a
brazen
platter
upon
which
lay
the
gory
head
of
the
eloquent
forerunner
of
christ
give
it
to
her
cried
herod
sternly
waving
him
towards
the
beautiful
maiden
who
stood
near
the
inner
door
the
executioner
placed
the
charger
in
her
hands
and
with
a
smile
of
triumph
she
bore
it
to
her
mother
who
had
retired
to
an
inner
room
all
the
disciples
of
the
murdered
prophet
then
went
where
jesus
was
preaching
and
healing
and
told
him
what
had
been
done
to
john
when
jesus
heard
of
the
death
of
john
he
was
very
sorrowful
writes
john
to
mary
and
went
away
into
a
desert
place
apart
in
the
meanwhile
the
disciples
of
john
baptist
fled
some
into
the
deserts
while
others
sought
jesus
to
protect
and
counsel
them
at
length
he
found
himself
surrounded
by
a
great
multitude
chiefly
of
john
disciples
besides
many
who
had
come
to
hear
him
preach
and
be
healed
of
him
the
place
was
a
desert
and
far
from
any
town
forgetful
of
all
else
save
following
jesus
they
were
without
food
which
says
john
writing
to
rabbi
amos
we
who
were
his
disciples
seeing
suggested
that
jesus
should
send
them
away
to
the
villages
to
buy
themselves
victuals
but
jesus
answered
us
and
said
quietly
need
not
go
away
give
ye
them
to
eat
and
simon
said
where
can
we
get
bread
for
so
many
we
have
among
us
but
five
loaves
and
two
small
fishes
upon
hearing
this
jesus
said
is
enough
bring
them
hither
to
me
we
collected
the
bread
and
fishes
and
i
myself
laid
them
upon
a
rock
before
jesus
he
then
said
to
us
the
multitude
to
sit
down
on
the
grass
and
when
they
were
all
seated
he
took
the
five
loaves
and
laying
his
hands
upon
them
and
upon
the
two
fishes
he
looked
up
to
heaven
and
blessed
them
and
then
breaking
them
into
fragments
he
gave
them
to
us
his
disciples
and
bade
us
distribute
to
the
people
as
often
as
we
would
return
for
more
we
found
the
loaves
and
the
fishes
undiminished
and
i
saw
with
wonder
how
when
this
prophet
of
god
would
break
off
a
piece
of
one
of
the
fishes
or
of
a
loaf
the
same
part
would
immediately
be
seen
thereon
as
if
it
had
not
been
separated
and
in
this
manner
he
continued
to
break
and
distribute
to
us
for
nearly
an
hour
until
all
ate
as
much
as
they
would
when
no
one
demanded
more
he
commanded
us
to
gather
up
the
fragments
which
lay
by
his
side
and
there
were
twelve
baskets
full
over
and
above
what
was
needed
the
number
that
was
thus
miraculously
fed
was
about
five
thousand
men
besides
nearly
an
equal
number
of
women
and
children
and
this
mighty
prophet
who
could
thus
feed
an
army
voluntarily
suffered
forty
days
and
nights
the
pangs
of
hunger
in
the
desert
he
seems
a
man
in
suffering
a
god
in
creating
this
wonderful
miracle
my
dear
father
is
one
that
has
too
many
witnesses
to
be
denied
not
a
day
passes
that
we
do
not
hear
of
some
still
more
extraordinary
exhibition
of
his
power
than
the
preceding
every
morning
when
men
meet
in
the
market
places
or
in
the
corridors
of
the
temple
the
first
inquiry
is
what
new
wonder
has
he
performed
have
you
heard
of
another
miracle
of
this
mighty
prophet
the
priests
alone
are
offended
and
speak
evil
of
him
through
envy
they
even
have
gone
so
far
as
to
assert
that
he
performs
his
miracles
by
magic
or
by
the
aid
of
beelzebub
the
prince
of
the
devils
if
we
suffer
him
to
take
men
minds
as
he
doth
said
caiaphas
to
rabbi
amos
yesterday
when
he
heard
that
jesus
had
walked
on
the
sea
to
join
his
disciples
in
their
ship
and
stilled
a
tempest
with
a
word
the
worship
in
the
temple
will
be
at
an
end
and
the
sacrifice
will
cease
he
draweth
all
men
unto
him
you
have
asked
dear
father
in
your
letter
where
is
elias
who
is
to
precede
messias
according
to
the
prophet
malachi
this
question
jesus
himself
has
answered
says
john
when
a
rabbi
put
it
to
him
he
replied
thus
elias
has
come
already
and
ye
have
done
unto
him
whatsoever
ye
listed
dost
thou
speak
of
john
the
baptist
asked
those
about
him
when
they
heard
this
john
came
in
the
spirit
and
power
of
elias
and
therefore
was
he
thus
called
by
the
prophet
was
the
answer
of
jesus
i
did
not
tell
you
that
besides
the
six
disciples
whom
i
have
named
he
has
chosen
six
others
which
twelve
he
keeps
near
his
person
as
his
more
favored
followers
and
whom
he
daily
instructs
in
the
doctrines
he
came
down
from
heaven
to
teach
of
the
thousands
who
never
weary
of
going
from
place
to
place
in
his
train
he
has
also
selected
seventy
men
whom
he
has
despatched
by
twos
into
every
city
and
village
of
judea
commanding
them
to
proclaim
the
kingdom
of
god
is
at
hand
and
that
the
time
when
men
everywhere
should
repent
and
turn
to
god
has
come
it
is
now
commonly
reported
that
he
will
be
here
at
the
passover
i
shall
then
behold
him
and
like
the
wise
men
i
shall
worship
him
with
mingled
awe
and
love
i
will
again
write
you
dear
father
after
i
see
and
hear
him
till
then
believe
me
your
affectionate
daughter
adina
letter
xvi
my
dear
father
while
i
write
the
city
is
agitated
like
a
tumultuous
sea
the
loud
murmurs
of
the
multitudes
in
the
streets
and
even
in
the
distant
reach
my
startled
ears
a
squadron
of
roman
cavalry
has
just
thundered
past
towards
the
temple
where
the
uproar
is
greatest
for
a
rumor
of
an
insurrection
begun
among
the
people
has
come
to
pilate
the
procurator
i
will
relate
to
you
the
circumstance
in
detail
yesterday
mary
cousin
john
returned
and
came
unexpectedly
into
the
hall
of
the
fountain
in
the
rear
of
the
house
where
we
were
all
seated
in
the
cool
of
the
vines
uncle
amos
was
in
the
act
of
reading
to
us
from
the
prophet
jeremiah
a
prophecy
relating
to
the
messias
that
is
to
come
nay
that
is
come
dear
father
when
john
appeared
mary
blushes
welcomed
him
and
showed
how
dear
he
was
to
her
uncle
amos
embraced
and
kissed
him
and
seated
him
by
us
and
called
for
a
servant
to
bathe
his
feet
for
he
was
dusty
and
from
him
we
learned
that
his
beloved
master
jesus
had
reached
bethany
and
was
reposing
from
his
fatigues
at
the
hospitable
though
humble
house
of
lazarus
mary
and
martha
when
we
heard
this
we
were
all
very
glad
and
uncle
amos
particularly
seemed
to
experience
the
deepest
satisfaction
if
he
come
into
jerusalem
said
he
warmly
he
shall
be
my
guest
bid
him
to
my
roof
o
john
that
my
household
may
be
blessed
in
having
a
prophet
of
god
step
across
its
threshold
i
will
tell
my
beloved
master
thy
wish
rabbi
amos
answered
john
doubtless
as
he
has
no
home
nor
friends
in
the
city
he
will
remain
under
your
roof
say
not
no
friends
i
exclaimed
we
are
all
his
friends
here
and
fain
would
be
his
disciples
what
rabbi
amos
also
cried
john
with
a
glance
of
pleasure
and
surprise
at
the
venerable
priest
of
god
yes
i
am
ready
after
all
that
i
have
seen
and
heard
i
am
ready
to
confess
him
a
prophet
sent
from
god
he
is
far
more
than
a
prophet
o
rabbi
amos
answered
john
never
prophet
did
the
works
jesus
does
it
seems
that
all
power
is
at
his
command
if
you
witnessed
what
i
witness
daily
as
he
traverses
judea
you
would
say
that
he
was
jehovah
descended
to
earth
in
human
form
nay
do
not
blaspheme
young
man
said
rabbi
amos
with
some
severity
of
reproof
john
bowed
his
head
in
reverence
to
the
rebuke
of
the
rabbi
but
nevertheless
answered
respectfully
and
firmly
never
man
did
like
him
if
he
be
not
god
in
the
flesh
he
is
an
angel
in
flesh
invested
with
divine
power
if
he
be
the
messiah
i
said
he
can
not
be
an
angel
for
are
not
the
prophecies
clear
that
the
messiah
shall
be
man
of
sorrows
is
he
not
to
be
seed
of
the
woman
a
man
and
not
an
angel
yes
answered
john
you
remember
well
the
prophecies
i
firmly
believe
jesus
to
be
the
messiah
the
son
of
god
yet
what
he
is
more
than
man
what
he
is
less
than
god
is
incomprehensible
to
me
and
to
my
we
wonder
love
and
adore
at
one
moment
we
feel
like
embracing
him
as
a
brother
dearly
beloved
at
another
we
are
ready
to
fall
at
his
feet
and
worship
him
i
have
seen
him
weep
at
beholding
the
miseries
of
the
diseased
wretches
which
were
dragged
into
his
presence
and
then
with
a
touch
with
a
word
heal
them
and
they
would
stand
before
him
in
the
purity
and
beauty
of
health
and
strong
manhood
and
yet
said
nicodemus
a
rich
pharisee
who
entered
as
john
was
first
speaking
and
listened
without
interrupting
and
yet
young
man
i
heard
you
say
that
jesus
of
whom
you
and
all
men
relate
such
mighty
deeds
has
remained
at
bethany
to
recover
from
his
fatigue
how
can
a
man
who
holds
all
sickness
in
his
power
be
subject
to
mere
weariness
of
body
i
would
say
unto
him
physician
heal
thyself
this
was
spoken
with
a
tone
of
incredulity
by
this
learned
ruler
of
the
jews
and
stroking
his
snowy
beard
he
waited
of
john
a
reply
so
far
as
i
can
learn
the
character
of
jesus
replied
john
his
healing
power
over
diseases
is
not
for
his
own
good
he
uses
his
power
to
work
miracles
for
the
benefit
of
others
through
love
and
compassion
being
a
man
with
this
divine
power
dwelling
in
him
for
us
he
is
subject
to
infirmities
as
a
man
he
hungers
thirsts
wearies
suffers
as
a
man
i
have
seen
him
heal
a
nobleman
son
by
a
word
and
the
next
moment
seat
himself
supporting
his
aching
head
upon
his
hand
looking
pale
and
languid
for
his
labors
of
love
are
vast
and
he
is
often
overcome
by
them
once
simon
peter
seeing
him
ready
to
sink
with
weariness
after
healing
all
day
asked
him
and
said
thou
givest
strength
to
others
why
suffer
thyself
when
all
health
and
strength
are
in
thee
as
in
a
living
well
to
be
weary
is
not
my
desire
to
escape
human
infirmities
by
any
power
my
father
hath
bestowed
upon
me
for
the
good
of
men
through
suffering
only
can
i
draw
all
men
after
me
he
replied
john
said
this
so
sadly
as
if
he
were
repeating
the
very
tones
in
which
jesus
had
spoken
it
that
we
all
remained
silent
for
a
few
moments
i
felt
tears
fill
my
eyes
and
i
was
glad
to
see
that
the
proud
pharisee
nicodemus
looked
moved
after
a
full
minute
serious
pause
he
said
this
man
is
doubtless
no
common
prophet
when
he
comes
into
the
city
i
shall
be
glad
to
hear
from
his
own
mouth
his
doctrines
and
to
witness
some
potent
miracle
prophet
he
is
without
doubt
answered
amos
it
is
not
the
question
now
whether
he
be
a
prophet
or
not
for
the
hundreds
he
has
healed
are
living
witnesses
that
he
has
the
spirit
and
power
of
the
old
prophets
and
is
truly
a
prophet
the
question
that
remains
is
whether
he
be
the
messiah
or
not
nicodemus
slowly
and
negatively
shook
his
head
and
then
answered
messias
cometh
not
out
of
galilee
at
this
moment
a
sudden
wild
joyful
cry
from
mary
thrilled
our
nerves
and
looking
towards
the
door
we
saw
her
folded
in
the
arms
of
a
young
man
whom
i
had
never
seen
before
my
surprise
had
not
time
to
form
itself
into
any
definite
explanation
of
what
i
saw
when
i
beheld
the
young
man
who
was
exceedingly
handsome
and
the
picture
of
health
after
kissing
the
clinging
mary
upon
her
cheeks
leave
her
to
throw
himself
into
the
arms
of
rabbi
amos
crying
my
father
my
dear
father
my
uncle
who
had
stood
amazed
and
wonderingly
gazing
on
him
as
if
he
could
not
believe
what
his
eyes
beheld
now
burst
into
profound
expressions
of
grateful
joy
and
as
he
clasped
the
young
stranger
to
his
heart
fell
upon
his
neck
and
wept
with
scarcely
power
to
articulate
the
words
my
son
my
son
lost
but
found
again
this
is
the
lord
doing
and
is
marvelous
in
our
eyes
john
also
embraced
the
and
the
ruler
stood
silent
with
wonder
while
i
was
looking
bewildered
upon
the
scene
mary
ran
and
said
to
me
with
tears
of
gladness
shining
in
her
dark
fine
eyes
it
is
benjamin
my
lost
brother
beloved
adina
i
did
not
know
you
had
a
brother
i
answered
in
surprise
we
have
long
regarded
him
as
dead
she
replied
with
mingled
emotions
seven
years
ago
he
became
lunatic
and
fled
to
the
tombs
without
the
city
where
he
has
long
dwelt
with
many
others
who
were
possessed
with
devils
for
years
he
has
neither
spoken
to
nor
known
us
but
oh
now
now
behold
him
it
seems
a
vision
see
how
manly
noble
like
himself
he
is
with
the
same
intelligent
smiling
eyes
she
then
flew
to
take
him
by
the
hand
and
lead
him
toward
me
all
eyes
being
fixed
upon
him
as
if
he
had
been
a
spirit
when
he
saw
their
wondering
gaze
he
said
it
is
i
both
son
and
brother
to
those
dearest
to
me
i
am
in
my
right
mind
and
well
who
has
effected
this
change
so
extraordinary
oh
my
son
inquired
rabbi
amos
with
trembling
lips
and
keeping
his
hand
on
shoulder
as
if
he
feared
he
would
vanish
away
it
was
jesus
the
prophet
of
the
highest
answered
he
with
solemn
gratitude
jesus
we
all
exclaimed
in
one
voice
i
could
have
said
so
answered
john
calmly
rabbi
nicodemus
thou
knowest
this
young
man
well
thou
hast
known
him
in
childhood
and
beheld
him
in
the
madness
of
his
lunacy
among
the
tombs
dost
thou
doubt
now
whether
jesus
be
the
very
christ
nicodemus
made
no
reply
but
i
saw
from
the
expression
of
his
face
that
he
believed
how
was
this
done
to
thee
young
man
he
asked
with
deep
and
visible
emotion
i
was
wandering
near
bethany
this
morning
answered
the
restored
one
with
modesty
when
i
beheld
a
crowd
which
i
madly
followed
as
i
drew
near
i
beheld
in
their
midst
a
man
whom
i
had
no
sooner
cast
my
eyes
upon
than
i
felt
seize
me
an
ungovernable
propensity
to
destroy
him
the
same
fury
possessed
seven
others
my
comrades
in
madness
and
together
we
rushed
upon
him
with
great
stones
and
knives
in
our
hands
the
crowd
gave
way
and
fell
back
aghast
and
called
him
to
save
himself
but
he
moved
not
but
left
alone
in
a
wide
space
stood
calmly
awaiting
us
we
were
within
a
few
feet
of
him
and
i
was
nearest
ready
to
strike
him
to
the
earth
when
he
quietly
lifted
one
finger
and
said
we
stood
immovable
without
power
to
stir
a
foot
while
our
rage
and
hatred
increased
with
our
inability
to
harm
him
we
howled
and
foamed
at
the
mouth
before
him
for
we
then
knew
that
he
was
the
son
of
god
come
to
destroy
us
out
of
the
men
and
depart
quickly
he
said
in
a
tone
of
command
as
if
to
us
but
really
to
the
demons
within
us
at
this
word
i
fell
at
his
feet
in
a
dreadful
convulsion
and
my
whole
body
writhed
as
if
it
had
been
wrestling
with
an
invisible
demon
jesus
then
stooped
and
laid
his
hand
upon
my
brow
and
said
arise
thou
art
made
whole
at
these
words
a
black
cloud
seemed
to
be
lifted
from
my
mind
the
glory
of
a
new
existence
appeared
to
dawn
upon
my
soul
while
his
voice
melted
my
heart
within
me
bursting
into
tears
the
first
i
have
shed
for
seven
years
i
fell
at
his
feet
and
kissed
and
embraced
them
when
benjamin
had
done
speaking
we
all
gave
glory
to
god
who
had
given
him
back
to
us
and
who
had
sent
so
great
a
prophet
among
men
i
commenced
this
letter
dearest
father
by
an
allusion
to
a
great
commotion
which
is
agitating
the
whole
city
but
as
i
have
taken
up
so
much
of
this
letter
in
relating
what
passed
yesterday
in
the
hall
of
the
fountain
i
will
leave
the
account
of
the
tumult
for
my
next
letter
which
i
shall
write
this
evening
may
the
god
of
our
fathers
be
with
you
and
bless
you
and
the
holy
people
of
the
promise
adina
letter
xvii
my
dear
father
when
on
the
morning
of
the
passover
it
was
noised
abroad
that
the
prophet
of
galilee
was
entering
the
city
by
the
gate
of
jericho
the
whole
city
was
stirred
and
from
houses
and
shops
poured
forth
crowds
which
turned
their
steps
in
that
direction
mary
and
i
went
upon
the
hoping
to
see
something
but
far
and
near
was
visible
only
a
sea
of
heads
from
which
a
deep
murmuring
arose
like
the
ceaseless
voice
of
the
ocean
chafing
upon
a
rocky
shore
the
top
of
the
was
visible
from
the
place
where
we
stood
but
it
was
black
with
the
people
who
had
crowded
upon
it
to
look
down
there
was
heard
at
length
an
immense
shout
as
of
one
voice
which
was
followed
by
a
swaying
and
onward
pressure
of
the
crowds
the
prophet
must
have
entered
the
gate
said
my
cousin
mary
breathlessly
how
they
do
him
honor
it
is
the
reception
of
a
king
we
were
in
hopes
he
would
pass
by
our
house
as
we
were
on
one
of
the
chief
thoroughfares
but
were
disappointed
as
he
ascended
the
hill
of
moriah
to
the
temple
a
part
of
the
ascent
to
the
house
of
the
lord
is
visible
from
our
roof
and
we
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
the
prophet
at
a
distance
we
knew
him
only
because
he
was
in
advance
the
nighest
one
to
him
mary
said
was
her
cousin
john
though
at
that
distance
i
could
not
have
recognized
him
the
head
of
the
multitude
disappeared
beneath
the
arch
of
the
temple
and
thousands
upon
thousands
followed
after
and
in
the
rear
rode
the
young
roman
centurion
whom
i
have
before
spoken
of
at
the
head
of
four
hundred
horse
to
keep
order
in
the
vast
mass
mary
could
not
recognize
him
saying
it
was
too
far
to
tell
who
he
was
but
i
knew
him
not
only
by
his
air
and
bearing
but
by
the
scarlet
pennon
that
fluttered
from
his
iron
lance
and
which
i
had
bestowed
upon
him
for
he
told
me
he
had
lost
one
his
fair
roman
sister
tullia
had
given
him
and
as
he
so
much
regretted
its
loss
i
supplied
its
place
by
another
worked
by
my
own
hands
illustration
street
in
jerusalem
the
multitude
as
many
as
could
gain
admission
having
entered
the
great
gate
of
the
temple
for
a
few
minutes
there
was
a
profound
stillness
mary
said
he
is
worshiping
or
sacrificing
now
perhaps
i
said
he
is
addressing
the
people
and
they
listen
to
his
words
while
i
was
speaking
there
arose
from
the
bosom
of
the
temple
a
loud
irregular
strange
outcry
of
a
thousand
voices
pitched
to
high
excitement
the
people
without
the
gate
responded
by
a
universal
shout
and
then
we
beheld
those
nighest
the
walls
retreat
down
the
hillside
in
terrified
confusion
while
to
increase
the
tumult
the
roman
horse
charged
up
the
hill
seeking
to
penetrate
the
masses
to
reach
the
gate
out
of
which
the
people
poured
like
a
living
and
river
before
which
the
head
of
the
cohort
recoiled
or
was
overwhelmed
and
i
held
my
breath
in
dreadful
suspense
not
knowing
the
cause
of
the
fearful
scene
we
beheld
nor
to
what
it
might
lead
mary
sank
almost
insensible
by
my
side
a
quarter
of
an
hour
had
not
passed
when
young
samuel
ben
azel
who
had
the
day
before
come
up
from
nain
to
the
passover
with
his
mother
entered
and
explained
to
us
the
cause
of
the
scene
i
had
witnessed
the
prophet
jesus
having
entered
into
the
temple
found
all
the
courts
filled
with
merchants
changers
of
money
and
sellers
of
cattle
to
the
sacrificers
portions
of
the
sacred
place
were
divided
off
by
fences
in
which
hundreds
of
sheep
and
cattle
were
stalled
on
his
way
to
the
inner
temple
the
prophet
found
his
path
so
obstructed
by
the
stalls
and
the
tables
of
the
brokers
that
he
had
to
go
around
them
and
often
to
turn
back
and
take
a
less
avenue
at
length
finding
upon
the
very
lintel
of
the
court
of
the
priests
a
priest
himself
engaged
at
a
table
as
a
and
near
him
a
levite
keeping
a
stall
for
selling
doves
and
sparrows
to
the
worshipers
he
stopped
upon
the
step
and
turning
round
cast
his
eye
which
now
beamed
with
an
awful
majesty
and
power
over
the
scene
of
noisy
commerce
and
bartering
every
face
was
turned
towards
him
in
expectation
the
bargain
was
suspended
and
buyer
and
seller
directed
their
gaze
as
by
a
sort
of
fascination
not
unmingled
with
a
strange
fear
and
awe
upon
him
those
who
had
crowded
about
him
drew
back
farther
and
farther
slowly
but
irresistibly
widening
the
space
between
them
and
him
they
knew
not
by
what
impulse
till
he
stood
alone
save
near
him
remained
john
his
disciple
the
uproar
of
the
buying
and
selling
suddenly
subsided
and
the
loud
lowing
of
the
cattle
and
the
bleating
of
the
sheep
stopped
as
if
a
supernatural
awe
had
seized
even
the
brute
creation
at
his
presence
and
only
the
soft
cooing
of
doves
stirred
the
vast
stillness
of
the
place
a
moment
before
a
scene
of
oaths
cries
shouts
of
running
to
and
fro
buying
and
selling
the
ringing
of
money
and
the
buzz
of
ten
thousand
voices
it
was
as
if
a
hurricane
sweeping
with
deafening
uproar
of
the
elements
over
the
lashed
ocean
had
been
suddenly
arrested
and
followed
by
a
great
calm
the
silence
was
dreadful
it
stopped
the
very
beating
of
my
heart
every
eye
of
the
vast
multitude
seemed
to
fasten
itself
on
the
prophet
in
expectation
of
some
dread
event
the
step
of
the
temple
upon
which
he
stood
seemed
to
be
a
throne
and
the
people
before
him
expecting
judgment
suddenly
the
silence
was
broken
by
a
young
man
near
me
who
gave
a
piercing
shriek
and
fell
insensible
upon
the
marble
floor
there
was
a
general
thrill
of
horror
yet
the
same
awful
stillness
succeeded
this
startling
interruption
that
one
intense
shriek
had
spoken
for
us
all
suddenly
the
voice
of
the
prophet
was
heard
clear
authoritative
and
ringing
like
the
trumpet
that
shook
sinai
when
the
law
was
given
is
written
my
father
house
shall
be
called
a
house
of
prayer
but
ye
have
made
it
a
den
of
thieves
he
then
picked
up
from
the
pavement
at
his
feet
a
small
cord
which
some
one
had
thrown
down
and
doubling
it
in
the
form
of
a
scourge
he
advanced
before
his
presence
fled
the
changers
of
money
priests
and
levites
sellers
of
oxen
sellers
of
sheep
sellers
of
doves
leaving
their
property
to
its
fate
these
things
hence
cried
the
prophet
not
my
house
a
house
of
merchandise
such
a
scene
of
confusion
and
flight
was
never
witnessed
as
now
followed
in
the
moment
of
panic
i
was
borne
along
with
the
current
money
tables
were
overturned
on
all
sides
but
not
the
most
avaricious
one
present
thought
at
that
moment
of
stopping
to
gather
any
of
the
gold
and
silver
which
the
rushing
thousands
trampled
beneath
their
feet
it
was
not
the
whip
of
small
cords
before
which
we
fled
for
he
touched
no
man
therewith
but
it
was
from
the
majesty
of
his
countenance
to
the
eyes
of
all
the
little
whip
seemed
to
blaze
and
flash
above
their
heads
as
if
it
were
the
fiery
sword
of
a
destroying
angel
in
a
few
moments
the
priests
court
of
the
temple
was
cleared
of
every
soul
as
we
fled
towards
the
south
gate
on
looking
back
i
saw
that
the
prophet
pursued
not
but
stood
alone
master
and
lord
of
the
temple
the
whip
was
no
longer
in
his
hand
and
his
whole
attitude
and
expression
of
face
seemed
changed
from
their
late
impress
to
an
air
of
the
profoundest
compassion
as
he
looked
after
us
still
flying
from
his
presence
my
uncle
rabbi
amos
who
on
his
return
from
the
temple
corroborated
what
samuel
had
stated
added
that
as
jesus
stood
alone
possessor
of
the
floors
of
the
courts
of
the
temple
the
high
priest
advanced
towards
him
and
with
awe
not
unmixed
with
anger
demanded
of
him
by
what
authority
he
did
these
things
his
answer
was
my
father
house
must
not
be
made
a
house
of
merchandise
art
thou
the
christ
asked
the
high
priest
still
standing
some
distance
off
from
him
if
i
tell
thee
that
i
am
ye
will
not
believe
what
sign
showest
thou
that
thou
art
sent
and
hast
authority
to
do
what
thou
doest
here
within
the
temple
hast
thou
not
had
proof
of
my
power
from
heaven
answered
jesus
stretching
forth
his
hand
towards
the
still
multitude
and
then
laying
it
upon
his
breast
he
added
destroy
this
temple
and
in
three
days
i
will
raise
it
up
be
this
to
you
o
priest
and
to
all
judea
the
sign
that
i
am
sent
by
my
father
who
is
in
heaven
as
he
hath
given
me
commandment
so
i
do
at
this
there
was
a
great
murmuring
said
rabbi
amos
for
many
of
the
priests
with
annas
also
had
got
boldness
and
drawn
near
to
hear
he
can
not
be
a
just
man
said
annas
nor
doth
he
honor
god
if
he
would
have
us
destroy
the
temple
yet
if
he
be
not
sent
of
god
whence
hath
he
this
power
over
men
answered
another
he
doeth
this
by
beelzebub
whose
prophet
he
doubtless
is
said
annas
in
a
loud
tone
for
a
true
prophet
would
not
seek
the
destruction
of
god
holy
house
thereupon
there
was
a
multitude
of
voices
some
crying
one
thing
and
some
another
caiaphas
at
length
obtained
silence
and
said
to
him
with
awe
art
thou
that
christ
of
the
prophets
i
am
calmly
and
firmly
answered
the
prophet
and
raising
his
eyes
to
heaven
he
added
impressively
i
am
come
down
from
god
when
adds
my
uncle
annas
heard
this
he
lifted
up
his
voice
in
an
exclamation
of
horror
and
cried
out
hear
ye
this
blasphemer
let
us
cast
him
forth
from
the
temple
which
he
pollutes
but
no
man
dared
approach
the
prophet
bear
witness
then
said
he
sorrowfully
rather
than
in
anger
that
i
have
come
unto
my
own
and
ye
have
received
me
not
this
temple
of
my
father
from
which
you
would
drive
me
forth
shall
no
longer
be
the
dwelling
place
and
altar
of
jehovah
the
day
cometh
when
your
priesthood
shall
be
taken
away
and
given
to
others
and
among
the
gentiles
shall
arise
my
father
name
on
every
hill
and
in
every
valley
of
the
earth
holy
temples
wherein
he
shall
delight
to
dwell
and
men
shall
no
longer
need
to
worship
god
in
zion
but
in
all
places
shall
prayer
and
praise
be
offered
to
the
most
high
this
temple
which
ye
have
polluted
shall
be
overthrown
and
ye
shall
be
scattered
among
the
nations
thus
speaking
the
prophet
quitted
the
temple
leaving
the
high
priest
and
priests
and
levites
standing
gazing
after
him
without
power
to
utter
a
word
such
my
dear
father
is
the
account
given
by
rabbi
amos
of
what
passed
in
the
temple
that
jesus
is
the
christ
is
now
beyond
question
for
he
has
openly
acknowledged
it
to
the
high
priest
adieu
dearest
father
the
servants
are
bringing
in
boughs
for
the
booths
and
i
must
close
this
letter
with
prayers
to
our
fathers
god
for
your
peace
and
welfare
adina
letter
xviii
my
dear
father
you
say
in
your
letter
which
i
received
from
the
hands
of
the
roman
courier
that
you
have
read
with
interest
all
my
letters
and
more
especially
those
which
relate
to
jesus
of
galilee
you
say
that
you
are
ready
to
acknowledge
him
as
a
prophet
sent
from
god
but
you
add
he
can
have
no
claim
to
be
the
christ
because
he
comes
out
of
galilee
to
this
objection
dear
father
rabbi
amos
desires
me
to
say
that
he
has
investigated
the
records
of
births
kept
in
the
temple
and
finds
as
i
have
before
named
to
you
that
jesus
was
born
in
bethlehem
he
afterwards
removed
with
his
parents
to
egypt
and
thence
returning
to
judea
settled
in
galilee
where
he
was
brought
up
of
these
facts
in
his
history
not
only
rabbi
amos
is
satisfied
but
nicodemus
also
whose
learning
you
will
not
gainsay
and
the
latter
very
much
to
our
surprise
and
my
own
delight
added
yesterday
when
we
were
talking
over
the
subject
at
supper
there
is
a
prophecy
o
rabbi
amos
which
strengthens
this
mighty
prophet
claim
to
be
the
messias
what
is
it
let
me
hear
all
that
can
strengthen
i
asked
earnestly
not
dear
father
that
my
confidence
in
him
needs
confirmation
but
i
wish
others
to
believe
you
will
find
it
in
the
prophet
hoseas
answered
nicodemus
and
thus
it
readeth
have
called
my
son
out
of
egypt
my
heart
bounded
with
joy
dear
father
at
hearing
this
prophecy
named
but
judge
my
emotion
when
nicodemus
taking
the
roll
of
the
prophet
isaiah
in
his
hand
read
the
words
that
follow
and
applied
them
to
jesus
beyond
jordan
in
galilee
of
the
gentiles
the
people
which
sat
in
darkness
have
seen
a
great
light
this
changes
the
objection
to
his
coming
from
galilee
into
additional
proof
of
his
claim
to
be
the
messias
in
my
last
letter
i
informed
you
that
rabbi
amos
had
invited
him
to
sojourn
with
us
during
the
passover
he
graciously
accepted
the
invitation
and
came
hither
yesterday
after
he
had
quitted
the
temple
from
which
he
had
with
such
commanding
power
driven
forth
the
merchants
and
hearing
while
expecting
him
the
rumor
flying
along
the
streets
the
prophet
comes
the
prophet
comes
uttered
by
hundreds
of
voices
of
men
and
children
i
hastened
to
the
the
whole
way
was
a
sea
of
heads
the
multitude
came
rolling
onward
like
a
mighty
river
as
i
have
seen
the
dark
nile
flow
when
pouring
its
freshening
floods
along
its
confined
banks
mary
stood
by
my
side
we
tried
to
single
out
the
central
person
around
whom
undulated
the
sea
of
heads
but
all
was
so
wildly
confused
with
the
waving
of
palm
branches
that
we
could
distinguish
nothing
clearly
while
i
was
straining
my
gaze
to
make
out
the
form
of
the
prophet
mary
touched
me
and
bade
me
look
in
the
opposite
direction
as
i
did
so
i
beheld
æmilius
tullius
the
young
roman
centurion
now
prefect
of
pilate
legion
advancing
at
the
head
of
two
hundred
horsemen
at
full
spur
in
order
to
meet
and
turn
back
the
advancing
column
of
people
as
he
came
opposite
the
house
he
looked
up
and
seeing
us
upon
the
parapet
he
gracefully
waved
his
gleaming
sword
saluted
us
and
was
dashing
past
when
mary
cried
out
noble
sir
there
is
no
insurrection
as
some
of
the
people
have
doubtless
told
thee
but
this
vast
crowd
moving
hitherwards
is
only
an
escort
to
the
prophet
of
nazareth
who
cometh
to
be
my
father
guest
i
have
orders
from
pilate
to
arrest
him
lady
as
a
disturber
of
the
peace
of
the
capital
shall
a
prophet
suffer
because
his
mighty
deeds
draw
crowds
after
his
footsteps
noble
roman
if
thy
troops
advance
there
will
be
a
collision
with
the
people
if
thou
wilt
withdraw
them
a
little
thou
wilt
see
that
when
the
prophet
crosses
my
father
threshold
they
will
go
away
in
peace
the
prefect
said
nothing
but
seemed
to
look
at
me
for
some
words
which
seeing
i
earnestly
entreated
him
to
do
the
prophet
no
violence
for
thy
wishes
sake
lady
i
will
here
halt
my
troop
especially
as
i
see
that
the
people
are
unarmed
the
centurion
then
gave
orders
to
his
horsemen
to
draw
up
in
line
opposite
the
house
the
multitude
now
came
near
but
many
of
those
in
advance
seeing
the
roman
horse
stopped
or
fell
into
the
rear
so
that
i
beheld
jesus
appear
in
front
walking
at
an
even
calm
pace
john
at
his
side
also
rabbi
amos
was
with
him
as
he
came
nigher
the
people
for
fear
of
the
long
roman
spears
kept
back
and
he
advanced
almost
alone
i
saw
john
point
out
to
him
our
house
the
prophet
raised
his
face
and
gazed
upon
it
an
instant
i
saw
his
features
full
his
countenance
was
not
that
of
a
young
man
but
of
a
person
past
the
middle
age
of
life
though
he
is
but
thirty
his
hair
was
mingled
with
gray
and
in
his
finely
shaped
oval
face
were
carved
evidently
by
care
and
sorrow
deep
lines
his
flowing
beard
fell
upon
his
breast
his
eyes
appeared
to
be
fixed
upon
us
both
for
an
instant
with
benignity
and
peace
deep
sadness
gentle
not
stern
seemed
to
be
the
characteristic
expression
of
his
noble
and
princely
visage
there
was
an
air
of
manly
dignity
in
his
carriage
and
mien
and
as
he
walked
amid
his
followers
he
was
truly
kingly
yet
simplicity
and
humility
qualified
this
native
majesty
of
port
he
seemed
to
draw
out
both
the
awe
and
love
of
those
who
saw
him
to
command
equally
our
homage
and
sympathy
passing
the
troop
of
horse
john
and
rabbi
amos
conducted
jesus
to
our
door
but
before
they
reached
it
there
was
a
loud
cry
from
several
harsh
voices
to
the
roman
to
arrest
him
on
looking
from
whence
these
shouts
came
i
saw
that
they
proceeded
from
several
of
the
priests
headed
by
annas
who
were
pressing
forward
through
the
crowd
crying
menacingly
we
call
upon
you
o
prefect
to
arrest
this
man
shame
on
thee
rabbi
amos
hast
thou
also
believed
in
the
impostor
we
charge
this
galilean
o
roman
with
having
made
sedition
he
has
taken
possession
of
the
temple
and
unless
you
see
to
it
he
will
have
the
citadel
out
of
your
hands
if
you
arrest
him
not
we
will
not
answer
for
the
consequences
that
may
befall
the
city
and
the
people
i
see
nothing
to
fear
from
this
man
o
ye
jews
answered
æmilius
he
is
unarmed
and
without
troops
stand
back
keep
ye
to
your
temple
it
is
from
your
outcries
comes
all
the
confusion
back
to
your
altars
if
commotions
arise
in
the
city
pilate
will
make
you
accountable
all
the
rest
of
the
people
are
peaceable
save
yourselves
we
will
take
our
complaint
before
the
procurator
cried
annas
who
was
the
chief
speaker
and
followed
by
a
large
company
of
angry
priests
and
levites
with
staves
in
their
hands
he
took
his
way
towards
the
palace
of
the
roman
governor
i
looked
my
gratitude
to
æmilius
for
so
fearlessly
taking
part
with
the
prophet
the
multitude
now
began
to
retire
as
the
roman
horse
slowly
moved
up
the
street
jesus
was
received
into
the
house
by
mary
and
taken
into
the
inner
hall
where
water
being
brought
rabbi
amos
himself
removed
the
sandals
of
the
prophet
and
reverently
washed
his
feet
while
mary
to
do
him
all
honor
dried
them
with
a
rich
veil
which
she
had
just
worked
in
anticipation
of
her
coming
bridal
with
her
cousin
john
it
was
at
this
moment
i
entered
the
hall
there
were
in
the
room
not
only
amos
and
john
and
mary
but
the
priest
elias
cousin
to
caiaphas
who
desirous
of
hearing
from
the
lips
of
the
prophet
his
sublime
teachings
had
come
in
with
him
there
were
also
present
five
men
whom
i
never
saw
before
but
who
john
said
were
his
disciples
i
however
had
no
eye
or
ear
for
any
one
but
jesus
i
saw
that
he
seemed
very
weary
and
pale
and
for
the
first
time
i
noticed
he
seemed
to
suffer
as
from
time
to
time
he
raised
his
hand
to
his
temples
desirous
of
serving
so
holy
a
person
i
hastened
to
prepare
a
restorative
which
bringing
it
into
the
hall
i
was
about
to
give
to
him
when
the
priest
elias
put
me
rudely
back
and
said
nay
maiden
let
us
witness
a
miracle
he
then
turned
to
the
prophet
and
said
master
we
have
heard
much
of
thy
power
to
do
miracles
but
have
seen
none
by
thee
if
thou
wilt
presently
show
me
a
miracle
i
will
believe
i
and
all
my
house
thou
hast
a
pain
in
thy
forehead
heal
it
with
a
touch
and
i
will
acknowledge
thee
the
christ
the
son
of
the
blessed
jesus
turned
his
eyes
upon
him
and
said
elias
thou
readest
the
prophets
and
shouldest
know
whether
he
who
speaketh
unto
thee
be
the
christ
or
no
search
the
scriptures
that
thou
mayest
know
that
the
time
of
his
visitation
is
come
and
that
i
am
he
i
do
no
miracles
to
relieve
my
own
suffering
i
came
into
this
world
to
suffer
isaiah
wrote
of
me
as
a
man
of
sorrows
and
acquainted
with
grief
blessed
are
they
who
not
seeing
shall
believe
but
master
said
the
aged
levite
asher
we
know
whence
thou
art
even
from
galilee
but
when
christ
cometh
no
man
knoweth
whence
he
is
it
is
true
o
man
of
israel
ye
both
know
me
and
whence
i
am
yet
ye
know
not
him
who
sent
me
ye
do
not
understand
the
scriptures
or
ye
would
indeed
know
me
whence
i
am
and
who
hath
sent
me
but
ye
know
neither
me
nor
him
that
sent
me
for
i
am
come
out
from
god
if
ye
had
known
him
ye
would
know
me
also
the
time
cometh
when
ye
shall
know
whence
i
am
and
believe
in
me
but
now
your
hearts
are
darkened
through
ignorance
and
unbelieving
when
he
had
thus
spoken
with
great
dignity
and
power
there
were
many
present
who
were
offended
and
some
voices
murmured
against
him
then
rabbi
amos
led
him
forth
to
the
apartment
he
had
prepared
for
him
in
going
to
it
the
prophet
had
to
cross
the
court
and
as
i
was
watching
his
retiring
footsteps
i
saw
four
men
who
had
climbed
to
the
from
the
side
street
the
doors
being
closed
let
down
a
fifth
in
a
blanket
at
the
very
feet
of
jesus
it
was
a
man
afflicted
with
the
palsy
and
their
own
father
jesus
seeing
their
filial
love
stopped
and
said
kindly
young
men
what
would
ye
have
me
to
do
heal
our
aged
father
holy
rabbi
believe
ye
that
i
can
do
this
he
asked
fixing
his
gaze
earnestly
on
them
yes
lord
we
believe
that
thou
art
the
christ
the
son
of
the
living
god
all
things
are
possible
unto
thee
jesus
looked
benignantly
upon
them
and
then
taking
the
venerable
man
by
the
hand
he
said
to
him
in
a
loud
voice
so
that
all
who
were
looking
on
heard
him
aged
father
i
say
unto
thee
arise
and
walk
the
palsied
man
instantly
rose
to
his
feet
whole
and
strong
and
after
casting
a
glance
around
upon
himself
he
threw
himself
at
the
feet
and
bathed
them
in
tears
the
four
sons
followed
their
example
while
all
the
people
who
witnessed
the
miracle
shouted
glory
to
god
who
hath
given
such
power
unto
men
such
my
dear
father
are
the
increasing
testimonies
jesus
bears
by
miracles
as
well
as
by
words
to
his
being
messias
the
god
of
our
fathers
keep
you
in
health
your
loving
daughter
adina
letter
xix
my
dear
father
the
visit
of
the
prophet
jesus
to
the
city
has
produced
results
of
the
most
amazing
character
the
priesthood
is
divided
caiaphas
has
publicly
recognized
him
as
a
prophet
while
annas
has
publicly
declared
that
he
is
an
impostor
and
thus
two
parties
are
formed
in
the
city
headed
by
the
two
priests
and
most
men
have
taken
sides
with
one
or
the
other
but
the
majority
of
the
common
people
are
in
favor
of
jesus
believing
him
to
be
the
christ
the
pharisees
most
oppose
him
because
he
boldly
reproves
their
sins
and
hypocrisies
even
nicodemus
who
at
first
was
inclined
to
accept
jesus
as
a
prophet
finding
the
pharisees
against
him
and
being
unwilling
to
lose
his
popularity
with
them
kept
away
from
the
house
where
jesus
was
by
day
but
his
curiosity
to
learn
more
of
him
led
him
to
visit
the
holy
prophet
secretly
by
night
this
he
did
twice
coming
alone
in
the
darkness
and
being
let
in
by
his
friend
rabbi
amos
what
the
results
of
these
interviews
was
i
can
only
tell
you
from
mary
account
she
overheard
their
conversation
her
window
opening
upon
the
corridor
where
jesus
was
seated
after
supper
alone
in
the
moonlight
for
full
an
hour
gazing
meditatively
heavenward
his
pale
and
chiseled
features
in
the
white
moonlight
seemed
radiant
as
marble
when
rabbi
amos
came
and
announced
the
ruler
nicodemus
as
desirous
of
speaking
with
him
bid
him
come
in
and
see
me
if
he
has
aught
to
say
to
me
answered
the
prophet
turning
towards
him
nicodemus
added
my
cousin
mary
then
came
to
the
corridor
wrapped
carefully
in
his
mantle
and
looking
about
to
see
if
he
was
unobserved
he
dropped
it
from
his
face
and
bowing
reverently
said
to
the
prophet
me
o
rabbi
that
i
come
to
thee
by
night
but
by
day
thy
time
is
taken
up
with
healing
and
teaching
i
am
glad
to
find
thee
alone
great
prophet
for
i
would
ask
thee
many
things
nicodemus
and
i
will
listen
to
thy
words
answered
the
prophet
said
the
ruler
of
the
pharisees
know
thou
art
a
teacher
come
from
god
for
no
man
can
do
these
things
that
thou
doest
except
god
be
with
him
that
thou
art
a
mighty
prophet
i
believe
as
do
all
men
but
art
thou
messias
tell
us
plainly
we
read
that
messias
is
to
be
a
king
who
will
rule
the
whole
earth
kingdom
o
ruler
of
the
pharisees
is
not
of
this
world
i
am
indeed
a
king
but
of
a
spiritual
kingdom
my
kingdom
unlike
earthly
kingdoms
has
no
end
and
those
who
enter
it
must
be
born
again
if
not
they
can
not
see
or
desire
this
kingdom
again
answered
nicodemus
with
surprise
can
a
man
be
born
a
second
time
o
rabbi
thou
speakest
in
parables
verily
i
say
unto
thee
answered
the
prophet
a
man
be
born
of
water
and
of
the
spirit
he
can
not
enter
my
kingdom
he
that
is
born
again
is
born
a
spiritual
man
and
of
my
kingdom
marvel
not
then
that
i
say
unto
thee
ye
must
be
born
again
when
nicodemus
left
him
rabbi
amos
said
it
indeed
true
o
master
that
thou
art
to
establish
a
kingdom
rabbi
amos
a
kingdom
in
which
dwelleth
righteousness
answered
the
prophet
shalt
yet
behold
me
on
my
throne
o
amos
raised
above
the
earth
and
drawing
all
men
unto
me
thou
have
thy
throne
in
the
clouds
of
heaven
o
master
that
thou
shalt
be
raised
above
the
earth
upon
it
asked
rabbi
amos
throne
shall
be
set
on
calvary
and
the
ends
of
the
earth
shall
look
unto
me
and
acknowledge
my
empire
thou
knowest
not
these
things
now
but
hereafter
thou
shalt
remember
that
i
told
thee
of
them
jesus
then
rose
and
bidding
his
host
retired
to
the
apartment
which
was
assigned
him
and
mary
remained
wondering
on
his
sayings
thus
dear
father
it
is
made
certain
from
his
own
words
that
jesus
is
the
christ
and
that
he
is
to
establish
a
kingdom
but
why
his
throne
shall
be
on
calvary
instead
of
mount
zion
rabbi
amos
wonders
greatly
for
calvary
is
a
place
of
skulls
and
of
public
executions
and
is
covered
with
roman
crosses
where
every
week
some
malefactor
is
crucified
for
his
crimes
this
morning
as
jesus
was
going
forth
from
the
house
to
depart
into
the
country
a
man
lame
from
his
youth
seated
upon
the
threshold
caught
him
by
the
robe
saying
master
heal
me
son
thy
sins
be
forgiven
thee
answered
jesus
and
then
passed
on
but
the
scribes
and
pharisees
who
stood
about
cried
this
man
be
he
prophet
or
no
blasphemeth
for
god
alone
can
forgive
sins
jesus
stopped
and
turning
to
them
said
which
is
easier
to
say
to
this
man
sins
be
forgiven
thee
or
to
say
and
walk
that
ye
may
know
that
the
son
of
god
hath
power
on
earth
to
forgive
sins
behold
then
in
a
loud
voice
the
prophet
said
to
the
lame
man
arise
take
up
thy
bed
and
go
to
thine
house
immediately
the
man
rose
to
his
feet
leaping
and
praising
god
and
taking
up
the
mattress
upon
which
they
had
brought
him
to
the
door
he
ran
swiftly
away
to
show
himself
to
his
kinsfolk
while
all
the
people
shouted
and
praised
god
thus
did
jesus
publicly
show
men
that
he
could
forgive
sins
if
he
could
heal
as
the
power
to
do
either
came
equally
from
god
does
not
this
power
prove
that
he
is
the
son
of
god
you
should
have
seen
him
dear
father
as
he
left
our
house
to
go
away
into
galilee
the
street
was
lined
with
all
the
afflicted
of
jerusalem
and
as
he
moved
on
between
the
rows
of
wretched
sufferers
whose
hollow
eyes
and
shrivelled
arms
were
turned
imploringly
towards
him
he
healed
by
words
addressed
to
them
as
he
moved
on
so
that
where
he
found
disease
before
him
stretched
on
beds
he
left
behind
him
health
and
empty
couches
we
all
wept
at
his
departure
and
followed
him
to
the
damascus
gate
here
there
was
assembled
a
large
company
of
levites
and
priests
among
whom
were
mingled
some
of
the
most
desperate
characters
in
jerusalem
knowledge
of
this
fact
reached
rabbi
amos
who
at
once
sent
a
message
to
æmilius
our
roman
friend
informing
him
that
he
apprehended
that
there
would
be
an
attempt
made
to
assassinate
jesus
at
the
going
out
of
the
gate
and
asking
his
aid
æmilius
placed
himself
at
the
head
of
fifty
horse
and
reaching
the
gate
pressed
the
crowd
back
and
took
possession
of
it
when
jesus
had
passed
through
the
armed
guard
beneath
the
arch
the
young
roman
courteously
offered
him
an
escort
to
the
next
village
æmilius
who
informed
me
of
these
things
conducted
him
as
far
as
ephraim
and
then
was
about
to
leave
him
to
return
to
the
city
when
four
lepers
came
from
the
cemetery
of
the
tombs
near
the
village
and
crying
out
afar
off
said
thou
blessed
christ
have
mercy
on
us
jesus
stopped
and
called
to
the
lepers
to
approach
as
they
obeyed
the
whole
company
of
people
as
well
as
the
roman
soldiers
drew
back
to
a
distance
in
horror
at
the
sight
of
these
men
they
came
timidly
within
twenty
paces
of
jesus
and
stood
still
tremblingly
fear
not
said
he
i
will
make
you
whole
he
then
advanced
towards
them
and
laying
his
hand
upon
each
of
them
they
all
at
the
touch
were
instantly
changed
to
well
men
with
the
buoyant
form
clear
eye
and
rich
bloom
of
health
when
æmilius
saw
this
miracle
he
dismounted
from
his
horse
and
falling
at
jesus
feet
worshiped
him
now
my
dear
father
i
have
thus
far
faithfully
written
all
that
i
have
heard
and
witnessed
respecting
jesus
as
you
desire
you
must
see
that
he
is
more
than
a
prophet
and
must
be
the
very
christ
the
son
of
the
blessed
withhold
oh
withhold
not
your
belief
longer
your
affectionate
and
loving
daughter
adina
letter
xx
my
dear
father
we
are
now
at
the
humble
abode
of
sarah
at
nain
whither
i
have
come
to
breathe
the
fresh
mountain
air
for
a
time
her
cottage
stands
in
a
garden
from
which
is
a
sublime
view
of
tabor
in
all
the
majesty
of
his
mountain
grandeur
one
day
while
i
was
in
the
garden
walking
two
men
dusty
and
stopped
at
the
gate
and
saluting
us
said
peace
be
to
this
house
maiden
and
all
who
dwell
therein
enter
said
the
widow
overhearing
them
enter
and
ye
shall
have
water
for
your
feet
and
bread
for
your
hunger
the
two
men
then
entered
and
seated
themselves
and
having
been
refreshed
by
the
poor
but
hospitable
widow
one
of
them
rose
and
said
day
is
salvation
come
to
this
house
we
are
ambassadors
of
jesus
of
nazareth
and
go
from
city
to
city
proclaiming
the
day
of
the
lord
at
hand
for
messiah
is
come
will
he
then
come
to
nain
asked
the
widow
with
emotion
i
should
be
willing
to
die
so
that
i
could
lay
my
eyes
once
upon
so
great
and
holy
a
man
yes
he
will
come
hither
answered
the
men
and
when
we
shall
report
to
him
your
hospitality
to
us
he
will
visit
your
house
for
he
never
forgets
a
cup
of
water
given
to
one
of
his
disciples
the
men
then
departed
again
calling
the
peace
of
god
upon
our
abode
they
had
not
been
gone
many
minutes
before
we
heard
a
great
commotion
in
the
near
by
upon
going
to
the
we
beheld
these
two
men
standing
upon
an
elevation
and
preaching
the
kingdom
of
christ
at
hand
upon
this
some
cried
out
against
jesus
and
others
threw
stones
at
the
two
men
and
when
we
reached
the
we
saw
one
of
them
remove
his
sandals
and
shake
the
dust
from
them
saying
in
a
loud
voice
as
ye
reject
the
words
of
life
your
sins
remain
upon
you
as
i
return
to
you
the
dust
of
your
city
they
then
departed
followed
by
levites
who
fairly
drove
them
from
the
town
while
we
were
grieving
at
this
enmity
against
a
prophet
sent
from
god
whose
life
is
a
series
of
good
deeds
there
entered
hastily
a
fair
young
maid
whose
name
was
ruth
she
held
an
open
letter
in
her
hand
and
her
beautiful
face
glowed
rosily
with
some
secret
joy
which
contrasted
strangely
with
the
present
sadness
of
our
own
we
knew
ruth
well
and
loved
her
as
if
she
had
been
a
sister
she
was
an
orphan
and
dwelt
with
her
uncle
elihaz
the
levite
a
man
of
influence
in
the
town
she
was
artless
unsuspecting
and
very
interesting
in
all
her
ways
what
good
news
dear
ruth
asked
mary
smiling
in
response
to
her
bright
smiles
a
letter
from
whom
for
sarah
answered
the
pretty
maid
blushing
so
timidly
and
consciously
that
we
half
suspected
the
truth
but
that
is
not
telling
us
from
whom
persevered
mary
with
a
little
playfulness
you
can
guess
she
answered
glancing
over
her
white
shoulder
as
she
bounded
away
from
us
into
the
house
we
were
soon
after
her
and
heard
her
as
she
cried
on
putting
the
letter
into
the
dear
widow
hand
from
samuel
god
be
blessed
cried
the
widow
my
son
liveth
and
is
well
read
dear
sarah
cried
the
maiden
he
was
at
alexandria
when
he
wrote
this
and
will
soon
be
at
home
oh
happy
happy
day
added
the
overjoyed
girl
quite
forgetful
of
our
presence
nay
said
the
widow
my
eyes
are
filled
with
tears
of
gladness
i
can
not
see
to
read
do
thou
read
it
aloud
let
adina
and
mary
also
know
what
he
writeth
ruth
then
cast
a
bright
look
upon
us
and
read
aloud
the
letter
from
over
the
sea
which
told
that
the
writer
would
return
in
the
first
ship
bound
to
sidon
or
cesarea
when
he
hoped
to
behold
her
and
his
mother
face
to
face
and
to
receive
as
his
bride
the
maiden
he
had
so
long
loved
and
cherished
in
his
heart
at
length
as
the
day
drew
near
for
me
to
leave
we
were
all
filled
with
delightful
surprise
at
the
appearance
of
the
son
and
lover
in
the
midst
of
our
happy
circle
mary
and
i
had
once
seen
him
and
we
were
now
impressed
with
his
manly
and
beauty
his
bold
air
and
frank
ingenuous
manner
we
could
not
but
agree
that
the
pretty
ruth
had
shown
fine
taste
but
alas
my
dear
father
our
joy
was
little
did
we
anticipate
how
speedily
our
rejoicing
was
to
end
in
mourning
the
very
night
of
his
return
he
was
seized
with
a
malignant
fever
which
he
had
brought
from
africa
with
him
and
we
were
all
overwhelmed
with
grief
it
would
be
impossible
to
paint
the
anguish
of
the
mother
the
distress
of
his
betrothed
unconscious
of
their
presence
he
raved
wildly
and
sometimes
fancied
himself
suffering
thirst
on
the
burning
sands
of
africa
and
at
others
battling
with
barbarians
for
his
life
all
that
physicians
could
do
was
of
no
avail
this
morning
the
third
day
after
his
return
he
expired
amid
the
most
distressing
agonies
alas
instead
of
a
bridal
behold
a
funeral
already
the
bearers
are
at
the
door
and
in
a
few
minutes
he
will
be
borne
forth
upon
the
to
the
without
the
city
oh
sighs
mary
near
me
as
i
write
oh
that
jesus
the
mighty
prophet
had
been
here
he
could
have
healed
him
john
has
sent
to
her
a
message
saying
that
jesus
is
traveling
this
way
on
his
mission
of
healing
and
teaching
and
may
be
here
this
evening
but
what
will
it
avail
dear
father
even
jesus
may
not
return
the
dead
to
life
oh
if
he
could
have
been
here
yesterday
his
power
over
disease
would
have
enabled
him
to
save
this
precious
life
i
hear
the
heavy
tread
of
the
in
the
court
below
the
shrieks
and
wails
of
the
thrill
my
soul
with
awe
but
above
all
pierces
the
wild
cry
of
anguish
of
the
bereaved
mother
ruth
voice
is
hushed
she
has
been
for
the
last
hour
inanimate
as
marble
only
by
her
pulse
can
it
be
said
she
lives
poor
maiden
the
blow
is
too
terrible
for
her
to
bear
my
cousin
mary
has
at
this
moment
received
a
small
roll
of
parchment
which
from
the
flush
on
her
cheek
i
know
to
be
from
her
betrothed
she
smiles
sadly
and
with
tears
in
her
eyes
hands
it
to
me
i
have
read
it
dear
father
it
is
as
follows
gadara
beyond
judea
the
bearer
beloved
is
one
of
the
disciples
of
jesus
his
name
is
bartimeus
he
was
blind
and
poor
and
subsisted
by
begging
and
as
you
see
his
sight
is
restored
and
he
insists
now
on
going
from
town
to
town
where
he
has
been
known
as
a
blind
man
to
proclaim
what
jesus
has
done
for
him
this
letter
cometh
beseeching
thee
maiden
that
as
we
love
one
another
unfeignedly
so
may
we
soon
be
united
in
that
holy
union
which
god
hath
blessed
and
commanded
but
having
much
to
say
hereupon
i
will
not
commit
it
to
paper
and
ink
but
by
or
the
day
after
i
trust
to
come
to
you
and
speak
with
you
dearly
beloved
face
to
face
upon
those
things
which
now
come
to
my
lips
farewell
lady
peace
be
with
you
and
all
in
your
house
greet
thy
friends
in
my
name
letting
them
know
that
we
shall
shortly
be
with
you
oh
that
the
mighty
prophet
had
come
one
day
sooner
cried
mary
what
woe
and
anguish
would
have
been
spared
poor
ruth
and
his
mother
but
the
will
of
jehovah
be
done
we
hear
now
dear
father
the
voice
of
the
governor
of
the
funeral
bidding
us
come
down
to
bury
the
dead
farewell
my
father
i
know
you
will
shed
a
tear
to
the
memory
of
the
noble
youth
whose
death
has
this
day
filled
all
nain
with
mourning
as
i
look
from
the
lattice
i
see
the
concourse
of
people
to
be
immense
filling
all
the
street
now
may
the
god
of
our
father
abraham
preserve
and
keep
you
and
suffer
us
once
more
to
meet
face
to
face
in
joy
and
peace
your
dutiful
and
sorrowful
daughter
adina
letter
xxi
my
dear
father
i
seize
my
pen
which
i
laid
down
an
hour
ago
in
order
to
follow
to
his
burial
the
son
of
our
hostess
to
recount
to
you
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
things
which
ever
happened
i
fear
my
trembling
fingers
will
scarcely
express
legibly
what
i
have
to
tell
you
when
the
burial
train
of
samuel
had
formed
to
go
to
the
grave
the
deep
grief
of
poor
ruth
overcame
her
wholly
and
i
led
her
to
her
room
where
she
sank
insensible
upon
her
couch
i
could
not
leave
her
in
her
situation
and
the
procession
went
forth
from
the
house
without
me
as
the
funeral
train
passed
the
lattice
it
seemed
endless
but
at
length
it
passed
by
and
i
was
left
alone
with
the
motionless
ruth
as
i
gazed
on
the
marble
countenance
of
the
bereaved
maiden
i
could
not
but
pray
that
she
might
never
recover
from
her
swoon
to
revive
to
the
bitter
realization
of
her
loss
suddenly
i
heard
a
great
shout
i
started
and
hastened
to
the
lattice
it
was
repeated
louder
and
with
a
glad
tone
it
seemed
to
come
from
beyond
the
city
walls
and
from
a
hundred
voices
raised
in
unison
i
knew
that
the
overlooked
the
walls
and
seeing
ruth
moved
not
i
ascended
rapidly
to
the
parapet
the
shouts
and
glad
cries
still
increasing
as
i
went
up
upon
reaching
the
flat
roof
and
stepping
on
the
parapet
i
saw
coming
along
the
street
towards
the
house
with
the
speed
of
the
antelope
elec
our
gibeonite
slave
he
was
waving
his
hands
wildly
and
crying
out
something
which
i
could
not
distinctly
hear
behind
him
i
saw
two
youths
running
also
appearing
to
be
the
bearers
of
some
great
tidings
i
knew
something
wonderful
must
have
occurred
but
could
not
divine
what
it
could
be
on
looking
towards
the
gate
from
which
direction
the
shouts
at
intervals
continued
to
approach
i
discovered
on
the
hillside
of
the
cemetery
many
people
crowded
together
and
evidently
surrounding
some
person
in
their
midst
for
the
whole
order
of
the
procession
was
broken
up
the
bier
i
could
not
discern
nor
could
i
comprehend
how
the
solemnity
of
the
march
of
the
funeral
train
was
suddenly
changed
to
a
confused
multitude
rending
the
sky
with
loud
acclamations
the
whole
body
of
people
was
pressing
back
towards
the
city
the
persons
whom
i
had
first
seen
running
along
the
street
now
made
themselves
audible
as
they
drew
nigher
he
is
alive
he
is
alive
shouted
elec
he
has
risen
from
the
dead
cried
the
young
man
next
behind
him
he
lives
and
is
walking
back
to
the
city
called
the
third
who
who
is
alive
i
eagerly
demanded
of
elec
as
he
passed
beneath
the
parapet
what
is
this
shouting
o
elec
he
looked
up
to
me
with
a
face
expressive
of
the
keenest
delight
mixed
with
awe
and
said
young
rabbi
samuel
is
come
to
life
he
is
no
longer
dead
you
will
soon
see
him
for
they
are
escorting
him
back
to
the
city
and
everybody
is
mad
with
joy
where
is
ruth
the
maiden
i
am
come
to
tell
her
the
glorious
news
with
emotion
that
i
can
not
describe
hardly
believing
what
i
heard
i
hastened
to
ruth
in
order
to
prevent
the
effects
of
too
sudden
joy
upon
reaching
the
apartment
i
found
that
the
voice
of
elec
who
had
shouted
the
news
of
which
he
was
the
bearer
into
her
ears
had
aroused
her
from
her
stupor
of
grief
she
was
looking
at
him
wildly
and
incomprehensively
i
ran
to
her
and
folding
her
in
my
arms
said
dear
ruth
there
is
news
good
news
it
must
be
true
hear
the
shouts
of
gladness
in
all
the
town
lives
she
repeated
shaking
her
head
no
no
no
yes
there
she
said
raising
her
beautiful
glittering
eyes
to
heaven
and
pointing
upward
but
on
earth
also
cried
elec
with
positiveness
i
saw
him
sit
up
and
heard
him
speak
as
well
as
ever
he
was
how
was
it
let
me
know
all
i
cried
how
who
could
have
done
such
a
miracle
but
the
mighty
prophet
we
saw
at
jerusalem
he
answered
jesus
i
exclaimed
with
joy
who
else
could
it
be
yes
he
met
the
bier
just
outside
the
but
here
they
come
elec
was
interrupted
in
his
narrative
by
the
increased
noise
of
voices
in
the
streets
and
the
tramp
of
hundreds
of
feet
the
next
moment
the
room
was
filled
with
a
crowd
of
the
most
excited
persons
some
weeping
some
laughing
as
if
beside
themselves
in
their
midst
i
beheld
samuel
walking
alive
and
well
his
mother
clinging
to
him
like
a
vine
upon
an
oak
where
is
ruth
he
cried
oh
where
is
she
let
me
make
her
happy
with
my
presence
i
gazed
upon
him
with
awe
as
if
i
had
seen
a
spirit
ruth
no
sooner
heard
his
voice
than
she
uttered
a
shriek
of
joy
he
lives
he
indeed
lives
and
springing
forward
she
was
saved
from
falling
to
the
ground
by
being
clasped
to
his
manly
breast
let
us
kneel
and
thank
god
he
said
for
a
few
minutes
the
scene
was
solemn
and
touching
beyond
any
spectacle
ever
exhibited
on
earth
when
he
had
performed
this
first
sacred
duty
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
received
all
our
embraces
hundreds
came
in
to
see
his
face
and
every
tongue
was
eloquent
in
praise
of
the
power
of
jesus
and
where
is
the
holy
prophet
i
asked
of
mary
shall
he
be
forgotten
amid
all
our
joy
we
thanked
him
there
with
all
our
hearts
and
bathed
his
hands
with
tears
of
gratitude
she
answered
but
when
they
would
have
brought
him
into
the
city
in
triumph
he
conveyed
himself
away
in
the
confusion
and
no
one
could
see
aught
of
him
but
john
who
was
with
him
told
me
he
would
come
into
the
city
after
quiet
was
restored
by
and
by
and
he
would
bring
him
to
our
abode
oh
i
shall
then
behold
him
and
thank
him
also
i
cried
make
known
to
me
mary
the
particulars
of
this
wonderful
miracle
as
we
went
weeping
forth
said
mary
slowly
following
the
bier
and
had
passed
the
gate
we
saw
coming
along
the
path
through
the
valley
leading
to
tabor
a
party
of
twelve
or
thirteen
men
on
foot
they
were
followed
by
a
crowd
of
men
women
and
children
from
the
country
and
were
so
journeying
that
they
would
meet
us
at
the
crossing
of
the
stone
bridge
hearing
some
one
say
aloud
is
the
prophet
of
nazareth
with
his
disciples
i
looked
earnestly
forward
and
joyfully
recognized
jesus
at
their
head
with
john
walking
by
his
side
that
jesus
had
been
in
nain
when
thy
son
was
sick
i
said
to
the
widow
pointing
him
out
to
her
as
he
and
his
company
stopped
at
the
entrance
to
the
bridge
recollecting
how
he
might
have
prevented
her
son
dying
had
he
been
in
nain
the
poor
lady
could
no
longer
command
her
grief
and
covering
her
face
with
her
veil
she
wept
so
violently
that
all
eyes
were
piteously
fastened
upon
her
i
observed
that
the
holy
prophet
gaze
rested
upon
her
with
compassion
and
as
she
came
opposite
where
he
stood
he
advanced
towards
us
and
said
in
a
voice
of
thrilling
sympathy
not
mother
thy
son
shall
live
again
know
it
o
rabboni
at
the
last
day
she
answered
if
thou
hadst
been
here
my
son
need
not
have
died
thy
word
would
have
healed
him
but
now
he
is
dead
dead
dead
weep
not
i
will
restore
thy
son
saith
he
cried
some
pharisees
who
were
in
the
funeral
he
will
raise
a
dead
man
this
is
going
too
far
god
only
can
raise
the
dead
and
they
smiled
and
scoffed
but
jesus
laid
his
hand
upon
the
pall
over
the
body
and
said
to
those
who
bore
the
corpse
the
bier
upon
the
ground
they
instantly
stood
still
and
obeyed
him
he
then
advanced
amid
a
hushed
silence
and
uncovering
the
marble
visage
touched
the
hand
of
the
dead
young
man
and
said
in
a
loud
and
commanding
voice
man
i
say
unto
thee
arise
there
was
a
moment
painful
stillness
through
the
vast
multitude
every
eye
was
fixed
upon
the
bier
the
voice
was
heard
by
the
spirit
of
the
dead
and
it
came
back
to
his
body
there
was
at
first
visible
a
living
trembling
emotion
of
the
hitherto
motionless
corpse
color
flushed
the
livid
cheek
the
eyelids
opened
and
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
jesus
then
he
raised
his
hand
and
his
lips
moved
the
next
moment
he
sat
up
on
the
bier
and
spake
aloud
in
his
natural
voice
saying
here
i
am
jesus
then
took
him
by
the
hand
and
assisting
him
to
alight
upon
his
feet
from
the
bier
led
him
to
his
mother
and
delivered
him
to
her
saying
behold
thy
son
upon
seeing
this
miracle
the
people
shouted
with
joy
and
wonder
has
indeed
visited
his
people
israel
a
great
prophet
is
risen
up
among
us
the
messias
is
come
and
jesus
is
the
very
christ
with
the
keys
of
death
and
hell
i
sought
out
jesus
to
cast
myself
at
his
feet
but
he
shrunk
from
the
homage
and
gratitude
which
his
mercy
to
us
had
awakened
thus
humility
is
an
element
of
all
power
such
my
dear
father
is
the
narrative
of
the
restoration
to
life
again
of
samuel
the
son
of
sarah
widow
of
nain
this
miracle
has
caused
hundreds
this
day
to
confess
his
name
and
to
believe
in
jesus
as
the
anointed
shiloh
of
israel
many
of
the
doctors
have
been
to
see
samuel
through
the
day
and
have
put
profound
questions
to
him
touching
the
state
of
the
soul
out
of
the
body
but
he
could
give
them
no
satisfaction
all
appearing
to
him
like
shining
fragments
of
a
gorgeous
vision
mary
is
to
become
the
bride
of
john
and
jesus
will
be
present
at
the
wedding
for
while
he
severely
rebukes
sin
and
folly
he
sanctifies
by
his
presence
the
holy
rite
of
marriage
on
the
eve
of
the
eighth
day
from
this
i
shall
depart
hence
with
john
and
mary
for
jerusalem
whence
i
will
write
you
again
your
loving
daughter
adina
letter
xxii
once
more
my
dear
father
i
address
a
letter
to
you
from
this
holy
city
this
morning
when
i
awoke
at
the
sound
of
the
silver
trumpets
of
the
priests
ringing
melodiously
from
the
top
of
mount
moriah
i
experienced
anew
that
profound
devotion
which
the
children
of
abraham
must
always
feel
in
the
city
of
god
and
in
the
presence
of
his
very
temple
it
was
a
joyous
morning
to
me
dear
father
for
æmilius
the
noble
roman
prefect
was
this
day
voluntarily
to
present
himself
at
the
temple
to
be
made
a
proselyte
to
the
holy
faith
of
israel
the
morning
was
therefore
additionally
lovely
to
me
i
thought
i
had
never
seen
the
olive
groves
on
the
hillside
beyond
the
king
gardens
so
green
nor
the
harvest
so
yellow
as
they
undulated
in
the
soft
breeze
of
the
opening
morn
the
lofty
palms
everywhere
appeared
to
bend
and
wave
their
verdant
fans
with
joyous
motion
the
birds
in
the
palace
gardens
sang
sweeter
and
louder
and
jerusalem
itself
seemed
more
beautiful
than
ever
while
i
was
gazing
upon
the
scene
and
adoring
god
and
thanking
him
for
the
conversion
of
æmilius
rabbi
amos
came
and
said
that
he
would
take
us
to
the
temple
we
were
soon
on
our
way
climbing
the
paved
pathway
to
moriah
oh
how
sublimely
towered
the
divine
temple
above
our
heads
seemingly
lost
in
the
blue
of
the
far
heaven
the
great
gates
opening
north
and
south
to
the
east
and
west
were
thronged
with
the
multitude
pressing
through
while
from
the
galleries
above
each
gate
pealed
forth
continually
the
trumpets
of
god
in
ceaseless
reverberation
my
uncle
pointed
out
to
me
the
massive
doors
all
overlaid
with
sheets
of
beaten
gold
and
the
floor
of
green
marble
on
which
we
trod
he
bade
me
notice
the
costly
entablature
of
colored
stones
exquisitely
worked
with
the
grecian
chisel
and
especially
the
roof
of
fretted
silver
set
with
precious
stones
the
onyx
beryl
sapphire
carbuncle
and
jasper
i
was
dazzled
by
the
magnificence
and
awed
by
the
vast
extent
of
the
space
of
splendor
surrounding
me
while
ten
thousands
of
people
were
to
be
seen
moving
towards
the
altar
of
sacrifice
from
that
superb
court
i
was
led
into
a
hall
nearly
a
hundred
cubits
in
length
its
ceiling
of
pure
gold
sustained
by
a
thousand
and
one
columns
of
porphyry
and
white
marble
ranged
alternately
i
was
not
permitted
to
approach
the
sacred
chamber
where
stood
the
four
thousand
vessels
of
gold
of
ophir
used
in
the
sacrifices
on
great
days
and
this
being
a
high
day
i
saw
no
less
than
six
hundred
priests
standing
about
the
altar
each
with
a
golden
censer
in
his
hand
beyond
is
the
holy
ark
of
the
covenant
over
which
the
cherubim
hover
their
wings
meeting
and
between
them
is
the
as
this
was
the
holy
of
holies
i
was
not
permitted
to
see
it
but
its
position
was
pointed
out
to
me
within
the
veil
which
conceals
from
all
eyes
but
that
of
the
high
priest
once
a
year
the
place
of
god
throne
on
the
earth
alas
now
left
vacant
since
the
glory
of
the
shechinah
departed
from
the
holy
of
holies
the
air
of
the
vast
temple
was
delicious
with
the
fragrance
of
burning
frankincense
as
the
victims
bled
and
the
smoke
ascended
the
people
fell
on
their
faces
and
worshiped
god
after
a
few
moments
silence
a
startling
trumpet
note
thrilled
every
soul
in
the
countless
multitude
it
was
followed
by
a
peal
of
music
that
shook
the
air
from
a
choir
of
two
thousand
singers
male
and
female
of
the
sons
and
daughters
of
levi
who
served
in
the
temple
entering
from
the
southern
court
they
advanced
in
long
procession
singing
sacred
chants
and
playing
on
sacbut
and
harp
psalter
and
nebble
chinna
and
tympana
as
they
ascended
to
the
choir
their
voices
mingling
with
the
instruments
filled
all
the
temple
i
never
heard
before
such
sublime
harmony
especially
when
on
reaching
the
elevated
choir
a
thousand
levites
with
manly
voices
joined
them
and
the
whole
company
chanted
one
of
the
sublimest
of
the
psalms
of
david
when
the
chant
was
concluded
the
whole
multitude
responded
amen
and
amen
like
the
deep
voice
of
a
mighty
wind
suddenly
shaking
the
foundations
of
the
temple
at
length
i
beheld
a
train
of
priests
following
the
high
priest
as
he
marched
thrice
around
the
altar
in
that
procession
i
discovered
a
company
of
proselytes
escorted
by
twelve
aged
levites
with
long
snowy
beards
and
clad
in
vestments
of
the
purest
white
among
the
proselytes
i
discerned
the
tall
and
noble
figure
of
the
roman
æmilius
he
was
robed
in
a
black
garment
from
head
to
foot
but
upon
approaching
the
baptismal
basin
two
young
priests
removed
this
outer
sable
dress
and
robed
him
in
white
i
then
saw
him
baptized
into
the
family
of
abraham
and
a
new
name
given
him
that
of
eleazer
i
heard
the
silver
trumpets
proclaim
the
conversion
and
the
multitude
shouting
their
joy
of
the
rest
of
the
ceremony
i
have
no
recollection
as
after
the
baptism
of
æmilius
i
was
too
happy
to
see
or
think
of
anything
else
while
i
was
lifting
up
my
heart
in
gratitude
for
the
happy
conversion
of
æmilius
and
while
the
jews
were
crowding
about
him
to
extend
to
him
the
hand
of
fellowship
rejoicing
that
so
noted
a
person
should
embrace
our
faith
uncle
amos
drew
my
attention
by
exclaiming
with
gladness
behold
there
is
jesus
the
prophet
we
at
once
made
our
way
but
with
difficulty
towards
the
spot
where
we
had
discovered
him
the
rumor
that
the
christ
was
in
the
temple
rapidly
spread
and
the
whole
multitude
pressed
towards
the
same
point
at
length
we
obtained
our
object
so
as
to
get
within
a
few
feet
of
him
here
a
tall
greek
addressed
rabbi
amos
saying
sir
tell
me
who
that
youthful
jew
is
whose
countenance
is
stamped
with
firmness
and
benevolence
so
finely
combined
in
its
expression
whose
air
possesses
such
dignity
and
wisdom
whose
noble
eyes
seem
filled
with
a
holy
sadness
and
whose
glance
is
full
of
innocence
and
sweetness
he
seems
born
to
love
men
and
to
command
them
all
seek
to
approach
him
pray
sir
who
is
he
that
o
stranger
is
jesus
of
nazareth
the
jewish
prophet
answered
uncle
amos
delighted
to
point
him
out
to
a
foreigner
then
i
am
well
rewarded
for
my
journey
in
turning
aside
to
jerusalem
answered
the
grecian
i
have
even
heard
of
his
fame
in
macedonia
and
am
rejoiced
to
behold
him
think
you
he
will
do
some
great
miracle
he
performs
miracles
not
to
gratify
curiosity
but
to
bear
testimony
to
the
truths
he
teaches
that
they
are
delivered
to
him
of
god
hark
he
speaks
cried
my
uncle
every
voice
was
hushed
as
that
of
jesus
rose
clear
and
sweet
and
thrilling
like
a
celestial
clarion
speaking
and
he
preached
dear
father
a
sermon
so
full
of
wisdom
of
love
to
man
of
love
to
god
of
knowledge
of
our
hearts
of
divine
and
convincing
power
that
thousands
wept
thousands
were
chained
to
the
spot
with
awe
and
delight
and
all
were
moved
as
if
an
angel
had
addressed
them
they
cried
never
man
spake
like
this
man
the
priests
seeing
that
he
had
carried
the
hearts
of
all
the
people
were
greatly
enraged
and
not
being
able
to
vent
their
hatred
and
fear
in
any
other
way
they
hired
a
vile
person
by
the
name
of
gazeel
a
robber
who
taking
one
of
the
sacrificing
knives
by
the
altar
crept
towards
him
behind
the
column
and
securing
a
favorable
position
to
execute
the
deed
raised
his
hand
to
strike
the
prophet
from
behind
when
jesus
turning
his
head
arrested
the
hand
of
the
assassin
in
by
a
look
unable
to
move
a
muscle
gazeel
stood
betrayed
to
all
eyes
in
this
murderous
attitude
like
a
statue
of
stone
return
to
those
who
hired
thee
my
hour
is
not
yet
come
nor
can
they
yet
have
any
power
over
me
the
assassin
bowed
his
head
in
abject
shame
and
terror
the
knife
dropped
from
his
hand
and
rang
upon
the
marble
floor
and
he
sank
at
jesus
feet
imploring
forgiveness
the
people
would
instantly
have
torn
gazeel
in
pieces
but
jesus
said
let
him
depart
in
peace
the
day
shall
come
when
he
will
be
willing
to
lay
down
his
life
to
save
mine
ye
priests
go
about
to
kill
me
he
added
fixing
his
clear
gaze
upon
the
group
which
had
sent
gazeel
for
what
do
ye
seek
my
life
i
have
come
to
my
own
and
to
my
temple
and
ye
receive
me
not
the
day
cometh
when
this
temple
shall
be
thrown
down
and
not
one
stone
left
upon
another
and
some
who
hear
me
shall
behold
and
mourn
in
that
day
oh
jerusalem
thou
that
killest
the
prophets
and
stonest
them
that
are
sent
unto
thee
how
oft
would
i
have
gathered
thy
children
together
as
a
hen
gathereth
her
chickens
under
her
wings
and
ye
would
not
thou
shalt
be
left
desolate
and
cast
out
among
cities
because
thou
knewest
not
the
day
of
thy
visitation
fly
ye
to
the
jerusalem
which
is
above
and
which
is
above
all
whose
foundation
is
eternal
and
whose
temple
is
the
lord
god
almighty
who
is
also
the
light
and
glory
thereof
upon
hearing
these
words
there
arose
a
great
cry
from
ten
thousand
voices
hail
to
jesus
the
king
of
israel
and
judah
hosanna
to
the
prince
of
david
we
will
have
no
king
but
jesus
at
this
shout
which
was
caught
up
and
repeated
beyond
the
four
gates
of
the
temple
the
priests
cried
aloud
that
the
people
were
in
insurrection
pilate
who
was
with
his
guard
just
leaving
the
court
of
the
gentiles
hearing
it
turned
to
ask
what
it
meant
one
of
the
priests
desirous
of
having
jesus
slain
quickly
answered
that
the
people
had
proclaimed
jesus
the
nazarene
king
hearing
this
pilate
sent
off
messengers
to
the
castle
of
david
for
soldiers
and
with
his
turned
back
to
the
temple
gate
charging
the
people
sword
in
hand
the
tumult
was
now
fearful
and
the
bloodshed
would
have
been
great
but
jesus
suddenly
appeared
before
him
none
saw
how
he
had
reached
the
place
and
said
o
roman
i
seek
no
kingdom
but
such
as
my
father
hath
given
me
my
kingdom
is
not
of
this
world
pilate
was
seen
to
bend
his
proud
head
with
low
obeisance
before
the
prophet
and
said
graciously
i
have
no
wish
to
arrest
thee
thy
word
o
prophet
is
sufficient
for
me
of
thee
i
have
hitherto
heard
much
wilt
thou
come
with
me
to
my
palace
and
let
me
hear
thee
and
see
some
miracle
thou
shalt
see
me
in
thy
palace
but
not
and
thou
shalt
behold
a
miracle
but
not
now
when
jesus
had
thus
said
he
withdrew
himself
from
pilate
presence
and
those
who
would
have
sought
him
to
make
him
a
king
could
nowhere
discover
him
the
result
of
this
attempt
of
the
people
to
make
the
prophet
their
king
and
under
his
direction
to
overthrow
the
roman
power
is
that
the
roman
authorities
instigated
by
annas
and
the
priests
look
upon
jesus
with
eyes
of
jealousy
and
pilate
this
morning
told
a
deputation
of
priests
who
waited
on
him
to
petition
him
to
arrest
and
imprison
the
prophet
that
on
the
first
proof
they
could
bring
him
of
his
hostility
to
cæsar
he
would
send
soldiers
to
take
him
jesus
was
refreshing
himself
in
our
house
when
several
scribes
and
pharisees
came
in
i
saw
by
their
dark
looks
they
meditated
evil
and
secretly
sent
elec
with
a
message
to
æmilius
now
eleazer
asking
him
to
be
at
hand
to
protect
jesus
for
æmilius
is
devoted
to
him
as
we
are
and
jesus
takes
delight
in
teaching
him
the
things
of
the
kingdom
of
god
jesus
knowing
the
hearts
of
these
bad
men
said
to
them
after
they
had
seated
themselves
and
remained
some
minutes
in
silence
wherefore
are
ye
come
master
said
zadoc
a
levite
of
great
fame
among
the
people
we
have
heard
how
boldly
thou
speakest
at
all
times
that
not
even
pilate
nor
herod
yea
nor
cæsar
could
make
thee
refrain
from
what
thou
choosest
to
utter
is
it
lawful
for
us
jews
the
peculiar
nation
of
god
to
pay
tribute
to
cæsar
who
is
an
idolater
is
it
lawful
for
us
to
obey
the
laws
of
pilate
rather
than
of
moses
we
ask
this
as
jews
to
a
jew
tell
us
frankly
jesus
looked
fixedly
upon
them
as
if
he
read
their
wicked
designs
and
said
show
me
the
tribute
money
zadoc
handed
him
a
penny
the
roman
coin
sent
into
judea
by
cæsar
as
our
currency
and
which
we
return
to
rome
again
in
tribute
when
jesus
had
taken
the
money
he
looked
at
the
head
of
augustus
stamped
upon
one
side
and
then
turning
to
them
said
whose
image
and
whose
name
is
here
impressed
cæsar
eagerly
answered
the
whole
party
then
render
unto
cæsar
the
things
that
be
cæsar
and
unto
god
the
things
that
be
god
was
his
calm
and
wonderful
answer
i
breathed
again
for
i
feared
he
would
answer
openly
that
tribute
ought
not
to
be
paid
which
they
hoped
he
would
do
when
they
would
immediately
have
accused
him
to
pilate
as
teaching
that
we
ought
not
to
pay
tribute
to
rome
and
so
fomenting
rebellion
but
the
divine
wisdom
of
his
answer
relieved
all
our
minds
while
the
scribes
and
levites
his
enemies
looked
upon
him
with
amazement
interchanged
glances
of
conscious
defeat
and
left
the
house
i
remain
your
affectionate
daughter

letter
xxiii
my
dear
father
i
have
received
with
joy
your
letter
in
which
you
say
you
shall
leave
egypt
with
the
next
passover
caravan
in
order
to
visit
jerusalem
my
happiness
is
augmented
to
know
that
you
will
be
here
while
jesus
is
in
the
city
for
it
is
said
and
john
mary
husband
asserts
that
he
will
certainly
be
at
the
passover
last
week
eli
the
paralytic
whom
you
knew
a
scribe
of
the
levites
whose
hand
has
been
withered
nine
years
so
that
he
had
been
dependent
on
the
alms
of
the
worshipers
in
the
temple
for
his
bread
hearing
of
the
power
of
jesus
sought
him
at
the
house
of
uncle
amos
where
he
was
abiding
jesus
was
reclining
with
our
family
at
the
evening
meal
at
the
close
of
the
day
on
which
the
uproar
had
taken
place
in
the
temple
when
eli
came
and
stood
within
the
door
humble
and
doubting
his
knees
trembled
and
he
timidly
and
wistfully
looked
towards
jesus
but
did
not
speak
i
knew
at
once
what
the
afflicted
man
came
for
and
approached
him
saying
fear
not
eli
ask
him
and
he
will
make
thee
whole
jesus
did
not
see
the
poor
man
his
face
being
turned
towards
rabbi
amos
but
leaving
this
conversation
he
said
in
a
gentle
voice
without
turning
round
come
to
me
eli
and
ask
what
is
in
thy
heart
and
fear
not
for
if
thou
believest
thou
shalt
receive
all
thy
wish
at
this
eli
ran
forward
and
casting
himself
at
jesus
feet
kissed
them
and
said
rabboni
i
am
a
poor
sinful
man
i
believe
that
thou
art
the
christ
the
son
of
the
blessed
dost
thou
believe
eli
that
i
have
power
to
make
thee
whole
asked
jesus
looking
steadily
upon
him
i
believe
my
lord
answered
eli
bowing
his
face
to
the
ground
thy
sins
then
be
forgiven
thee
rise
and
go
to
thy
house
and
sin
no
more
lest
a
worse
thing
come
upon
thee
this
man
forgiveth
he
sins
also
cried
a
venerable
priest
manasses
who
was
at
the
table
he
is
a
blasphemer
for
god
alone
forgiveth
sins
will
he
call
himself
god
and
he
rose
quickly
up
and
rent
his
robe
and
spat
upon
the
floor
in
detestation
manasses
said
jesus
mildly
tell
me
whether
it
is
an
easier
thing
to
do
to
say
unto
this
man
kneeling
here
sins
be
forgiven
thee
or
to
say
forth
thine
hand
whole
as
the
other
it
would
be
more
difficult
to
do
the
latter
answered
manasses
surprised
at
the
question
god
alone
who
made
him
can
do
that
jesus
turned
to
the
paralytic
i
say
unto
thee
eli
stretch
forth
thy
hand
whole
the
man
looking
upon
jesus
face
and
seeming
to
derive
confidence
from
its
expression
of
power
made
a
convulsive
movement
with
his
arm
which
was
bared
to
the
shoulder
exhibiting
all
its
hideous
deformity
and
stretched
it
forth
at
full
length
immediately
the
arm
was
rounded
with
flesh
and
muscles
the
pulse
filled
and
leaped
with
the
warm
and
it
became
whole
as
the
other
the
change
was
so
instantaneous
that
it
was
done
before
we
could
see
how
it
was
done
the
amazed
and
wonderingly
delighted
eli
bent
his
elbow
and
expanded
and
contracted
the
fingers
felt
the
flesh
and
pressed
it
with
his
other
hand
before
he
could
realize
he
was
healed
then
casting
himself
at
the
feet
of
the
prophet
he
cried
thou
art
not
a
man
but
gabriel
the
angel
of
god
thou
art
now
healed
eli
said
jesus
impressively
worship
god
and
go
and
sin
no
more
who
dear
father
but
messias
could
do
this
miracle
my
mind
is
overwhelmed
i
am
filled
with
astonishment
and
awe
when
i
reflect
upon
the
might
power
and
majesty
of
jesus
and
i
fear
to
ask
myself
who
more
than
man
is
he
is
he
verily
the
awful
and
terrible
jehovah
of
sinai
visible
in
the
human
form
oh
wondrous
and
incomprehensible
mystery
i
dare
not
trust
my
thoughts
to
penetrate
the
mystery
in
which
he
walks
among
us
in
the
veiled
godhead
of
his
power
his
beloved
disciple
john
said
that
jesus
has
told
him
the
day
is
not
far
off
when
this
veil
will
be
removed
and
when
we
shall
then
know
him
who
he
is
and
wherefore
he
has
come
into
the
world
and
the
infinite
results
to
men
of
his

letter
xxiv
my
dear
father
as
i
was
closing
my
last
letter
to
you
intelligence
reached
my
uncle
amos
that
lazarus
the
amiable
brother
of
martha
and
mary
was
very
ill
the
message
was
brought
by
elec
the
gibeonite
slave
who
with
tears
in
his
eyes
communicated
to
us
the
sad
news
my
cousin
mary
and
i
at
once
set
out
to
bethany
with
him
knowest
thou
elec
the
disease
that
has
so
suddenly
seized
my
cousin
asked
mary
as
we
wound
slowly
up
the
path
that
leads
around
the
steepest
side
of
olivet
ah
dear
me
noble
lady
i
know
not
answered
elec
shaking
his
head
he
had
just
returned
from
the
city
where
he
had
been
staying
night
and
day
for
a
week
laboring
industriously
to
complete
a
copy
of
the
five
books
of
the
blessed
moses
for
the
procurator
chief
captain
for
which
he
was
to
receive
a
large
sum
in
roman
gold
what
was
the
name
of
this
captain
who
seeks
to
obtain
our
holy
books
i
asked
hope
half
answering
the
question
in
my
heart
æmilius
the
brave
knight
they
say
who
was
made
a
proselyte
at
the
last
passover
i
was
rejoiced
to
hear
this
proof
of
the
steady
desire
of
the
princely
roman
knight
to
learn
our
sacred
laws
you
may
be
assured
dearest
father
but
elec
went
on
speaking
and
said
it
was
his
hard
work
to
complete
this
copy
which
made
him
ill
for
he
slept
not
nor
ceased
to
toil
until
he
had
completed
it
and
when
he
came
home
with
the
roll
in
his
hand
and
laid
it
upon
the
table
before
his
sisters
he
fell
at
the
same
moment
fainting
to
the
ground
alas
poor
lazarus
we
both
exclaimed
and
urged
our
mules
forward
at
a
faster
pace
our
hearts
bleeding
for
the
sorrow
of
his
sisters
and
for
his
sad
condition
at
length
half
an
hour
after
leaving
the
gate
of
the
city
we
drew
near
to
bethany
and
beheld
the
roof
of
the
house
of
lazarus
upon
it
watching
the
road
towards
jerusalem
for
us
we
discovered
the
graceful
form
of
mary
in
a
few
moments
we
were
in
her
arms
mingling
our
tears
together
does
he
yet
live
i
asked
scarcely
daring
to
inquire
as
she
led
us
into
the
house
yes
lives
but
fails
hourly
answered
mary
with
forced
composure
god
bless
you
both
for
hastening
to
me
at
this
moment
martha
pale
and
suffering
face
beautiful
even
in
its
pallor
appeared
in
the
door
of
the
inner
room
upon
seeing
us
she
advanced
and
taking
both
our
hands
in
hers
said
in
a
touching
whisper
you
have
come
sweet
friends
to
see
my
brother
die
she
then
led
us
into
the
room
where
lay
upon
a
couch
the
form
of
the
invalid
he
has
slept
a
little
said
martha
softly
to
me
but
his
fever
is
consuming
him
he
has
now
closed
his
eyes
again
and
seems
heavy
but
his
slumbers
are
restless
as
you
see
and
he
seems
to
think
his
dear
friend
jesus
the
prophet
is
by
him
or
he
talks
of
rachel
as
if
she
were
not
present
and
who
is
rachel
dear
martha
i
asked
as
i
was
about
to
follow
her
out
of
the
room
leaving
her
brother
to
his
weary
repose
alas
it
was
for
rachel
gentle
love
sake
he
now
lies
there
she
answered
there
is
the
sweet
maiden
kneeling
on
the
other
side
of
his
couch
her
tearful
face
buried
in
the
folds
of
the
curtains
i
turned
and
regarded
with
tender
interest
the
graceful
and
form
of
the
young
girl
as
she
bent
over
his
pillow
her
hand
clasped
by
his
at
this
moment
she
looked
up
and
directed
her
gaze
towards
me
her
face
was
inexpressibly
lovely
bathed
as
it
was
in
its
glittering
and
her
large
glorious
eyes
shone
like
starry
heavens
of
tenderness
and
love
her
hair
would
have
been
raven
black
save
that
rays
of
golden
bronze
enriched
its
waving
masses
with
every
play
of
the
light
upon
it
as
our
eyes
met
she
seemed
to
receive
me
into
her
soul
and
my
heart
to
embrace
hers
lazarus
now
moved
and
murmured
her
name
when
she
dropped
her
eyes
and
bent
like
an
angel
over
him
who
is
this
marvelously
lovely
maiden
i
asked
of
martha
as
we
went
into
the
court
of
the
hall
the
betrothed
bride
of
our
beloved
brother
answered
she
sit
with
me
here
in
the
shade
beneath
this
vine
and
i
will
tell
thee
their
sad
story
lazarus
you
know
dearest
adina
is
a
writer
in
the
temple
and
by
his
labors
has
surrounded
us
all
with
many
comforts
nay
luxuries
his
attachment
to
us
led
him
to
forego
the
pleasure
of
all
other
society
as
he
said
he
found
in
our
sweet
bond
of
sisterly
love
all
that
he
required
to
render
him
happy
but
a
few
weeks
ago
as
he
was
engaged
late
and
alone
in
the
of
the
temple
upon
a
roll
which
the
noble
æmilius
had
ordered
he
was
startled
by
the
sudden
entrance
of
a
young
girl
in
great
terror
who
seemed
to
be
flying
from
pursuit
upon
beholding
him
she
bounded
towards
him
and
casting
herself
at
his
feet
implored
his
protection
amazed
and
interested
he
promptly
promised
it
but
had
hardly
spoken
the
words
before
annas
entered
and
advanced
towards
her
his
face
was
flushed
with
rage
and
his
voice
was
loud
and
fierce
as
he
demanded
her
at
the
hand
of
my
brother
my
lord
annas
answered
lazarus
boldly
a
dove
to
seek
shelter
from
a
hawk
in
my
bosom
i
would
protect
it
much
more
a
distressed
maiden
of
the
daughters
of
abraham
and
he
placed
himself
before
the
fugitive
thou
protect
from
me
she
is
my
child
a
wicked
and
disobedient
daughter
of
belial
resign
her
to
me
young
scrivener
or
i
will
have
thee
sent
to
the
lowest
dungeon
of
the
castle
of
david
save
me
save
me
cried
the
young
girl
as
annas
advanced
to
seize
her
am
not
his
child
i
am
the
orphan
of
rabbi
levi
who
left
me
and
my
estate
to
this
false
priest
as
a
sacred
charge
he
would
now
sell
me
in
unholy
marriage
to
a
greek
captain
in
the
roman
legion
who
offers
him
large
bribes
in
gold
for
me
rather
than
be
given
into
the
hands
of
this
fierce
and
terrible
grecian
i
will
cast
myself
down
from
the
height
of
the
temple
and
to
the
surprise
and
horror
of
lazarus
she
bounded
from
the
lattice
and
stood
upon
the
edge
of
the
rock
which
looks
sheer
three
hundred
feet
down
into
the
valley
beneath
seest
o
annas
to
what
thy
cupidity
for
gold
will
drive
this
maiden
has
the
land
of
israel
sunk
so
low
that
its
chief
priest
will
sell
the
daughters
of
the
land
for
gold
to
the
lust
of
the
gentiles
is
this
the
way
thou
givest
protection
to
orphans
leave
her
and
until
i
find
a
protector
for
her
she
shall
be
a
sacred
guest
with
my
sisters
in
their
humble
abode
life
shall
pay
for
this
arrogance
young
man
answered
the
priest
have
power
and
will
exercise
it
to
the
danger
and
wrong
of
this
maiden
my
lord
annas
whom
jehovah
will
protect
since
she
has
trustingly
sought
the
sheltering
wing
of
his
altars
answered
my
brother
firmly
thou
continue
to
persecute
her
i
will
appeal
to
the
procurator
pontius
pilate
against
thee
the
result
was
continued
martha
that
the
wicked
priest
alarmed
by
the
threat
of
appeal
to
pilate
relinquished
his
present
purpose
and
left
them
breathing
menaces
against
my
brother
the
same
day
lazarus
conducted
the
maiden
whom
you
already
guess
to
be
rachel
to
our
house
she
has
since
then
been
our
guest
and
has
won
all
our
hearts
as
well
as
our
dear
brother
is
there
no
hope
for
him
i
asked
after
listening
to
her
touching
narrative
none
the
physicians
say
that
he
will
never
rise
again
there
is
one
hope
left
i
said
eagerly
what
is
that
demanded
martha
jesus
i
answered
send
to
him
o
martha
and
he
will
yet
save
him
and
raise
him
up
to
life
and
health
i
had
no
sooner
spoken
than
mary
who
overheard
me
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
yes
jesus
has
the
power
to
heal
him
and
jesus
loves
him
he
will
come
and
save
him
the
moment
he
hears
of
his
danger
immediately
mary
wrote
on
a
slip
of
parchment
these
brief
and
touching
words
lord
behold
he
whom
thou
lovest
is
sick
hasten
to
come
to
us
that
he
may
live
for
nothing
is
impossible
with
thee
this
message
was
forthwith
despatched
by
the
hands
of
a
young
friend
to
bethabara
beyond
jordan
where
we
learned
jesus
at
present
abides
we
have
therefore
no
hope
for
our
dear
relative
but
in
the
power
of
the
prophet
i
will
write
as
soon
as
we
hear
i
remain
dear
father
your
attached
daughter
adina
letter
xxv
my
dear
and
honored
father
it
is
with
emotions
of
the
deepest
grief
that
i
convey
to
you
the
sad
intelligence
of
the
death
of
lazarus
the
hand
of
the
lord
hath
fallen
heavily
upon
this
household
and
stricken
down
its
prop
smitten
the
oak
around
which
clung
these
sisters
in
their
dependence
upon
him
and
confiding
trust
in
his
wisdom
and
love
now
prostrate
in
the
dust
they
lie
stunned
by
the
sudden
and
mysterious
stroke
of
god
providence
i
have
told
you
dear
father
something
of
this
family
what
a
happy
household
i
have
seen
it
when
jesus
completed
the
number
for
he
stayed
so
much
with
them
when
not
preaching
or
when
wishing
to
rest
a
day
or
two
from
his
weary
toil
that
they
came
to
regard
him
as
one
of
their
family
martha
seemed
ever
to
be
thinking
what
and
how
she
should
administer
to
his
comfort
by
providing
every
delicacy
for
her
table
but
so
that
jesus
could
find
listeners
to
his
words
of
truth
and
wisdom
like
mary
who
loved
to
sit
at
his
feet
and
hear
the
golden
language
fall
from
his
sacred
lips
he
thought
not
of
meat
or
drink
one
day
when
i
with
mary
and
lazarus
was
listening
to
his
heavenly
teachings
wrapt
in
wonder
and
absorbing
interest
martha
who
was
preparing
the
meal
came
and
desired
mary
to
come
and
assist
her
but
the
dear
pious
girl
heeded
not
nor
heard
her
feeding
forgetful
of
all
else
upon
the
celestial
food
that
fell
from
the
lips
of
jesus
at
length
martha
finding
that
mary
had
not
heard
appealed
to
jesus
saying
somewhat
sharply
lord
dost
thou
not
care
that
my
sister
hath
left
me
to
serve
alone
bid
her
therefore
that
she
help
me
we
turned
with
surprise
to
hear
her
who
was
usually
so
gentle
and
good
thus
forget
what
was
due
to
the
presence
of
the
prophet
and
lazarus
was
about
to
speak
and
excuse
his
sister
who
looked
as
if
she
were
much
worried
with
her
domestic
troubles
when
jesus
said
kindly
to
her
martha
martha
thou
art
careful
and
troubled
about
many
things
but
one
thing
is
needful
and
mary
hath
chosen
that
good
part
which
shall
not
be
taken
away
from
her
while
thou
carest
much
for
the
wants
of
the
body
she
careth
for
those
of
the
spirit
think
not
beloved
martha
of
sumptuous
living
for
me
who
have
no
earthly
goods
nor
even
where
to
lay
my
head
say
not
thus
oh
say
not
so
dear
lord
cried
martha
suddenly
bursting
into
tears
at
jesus
touching
words
and
casting
herself
impulsively
at
his
feet
this
house
is
thy
home
ever
beneath
its
roof
while
i
have
one
above
me
shalt
thou
have
where
to
lay
thy
head
say
not
so
my
lord
we
were
all
moved
at
martha
pathetic
earnestness
jesus
raised
her
up
and
said
gently
it
is
thy
love
for
me
i
well
know
that
maketh
thee
so
careful
and
troubled
to
provide
for
me
at
thy
bountiful
table
but
i
have
meat
to
eat
that
ye
know
not
of
to
teach
the
truths
of
god
as
thou
findest
me
doing
to
these
is
to
me
meat
and
drink
for
therein
i
am
doing
my
father
will
who
sent
me
my
last
letter
closed
with
informing
you
of
the
departure
of
the
messenger
to
jesus
after
he
had
gone
out
of
sight
from
the
door
and
the
last
echo
of
his
horse
hoofs
ceased
to
be
heard
by
the
ears
of
his
sister
martha
i
the
room
where
lazarus
lay
he
was
as
white
as
marble
his
large
black
eyes
seemed
to
be
twice
their
usual
size
and
brilliancy
he
breathed
with
difficulty
and
every
few
moments
he
would
be
compelled
to
have
his
head
raised
in
order
to
free
his
mouth
from
the
welling
blood
that
was
constantly
bubbling
up
from
the
broken
fountains
of
his
life
mary
tender
privilege
it
was
assisted
by
rachel
to
render
him
this
service
of
love
as
she
bent
over
him
looking
downward
with
anxious
fondness
into
his
pale
intellectual
face
watching
every
shadow
of
the
change
that
the
sable
wing
of
advancing
death
cast
over
it
i
thought
i
had
never
gazed
on
a
more
lovely
being
i
forgot
for
the
moment
the
dying
young
man
about
whose
form
her
arms
were
entwined
his
head
reclining
upon
her
bosom
her
raven
tresses
bronzed
with
a
changing
light
all
unbound
and
floating
above
him
and
over
his
pillow
like
a
rich
veil
interwoven
of
sable
silken
floss
and
threads
of
gold
i
commenced
this
letter
by
informing
you
of
the
departure
of
the
good
and
generous
and
pious
lazarus
he
fell
asleep
in
death
as
an
infant
sinks
to
slumber
in
its
mother
arms
all
too
late
was
jesus
sent
for
his
burial
will
take
place
alas
how
suddenly
has
perished
the
noblest
young
man
in
judea
farewell
dear
father
my
heart
is
full
i
can
now
write
no
more
the
god
of
abraham
preserve
you
in
your
journey
and
bring
you
in
safety
to
the
embraces
of
your
loving
daughter
adina
letter
xxvi
my
dear
father
in
my
last
letter
i
told
you
that
lazarus
was
dead
i
write
this
to
say
that
he
who
was
dead
is
alive
lazarus
lives
he
whom
i
saw
dead
and
buried
and
sealed
up
within
the
rocky
cave
of
the
tomb
is
alive
again
from
the
dead
and
at
this
moment
while
i
am
penning
this
extraordinary
account
i
hear
his
voice
from
the
porch
how
my
dear
father
how
shall
i
find
adequate
language
to
tell
you
all
that
has
happened
here
within
the
last
hours
the
funeral
procession
was
so
very
long
that
strangers
pausing
asked
what
great
master
in
israel
or
person
of
note
was
being
taken
to
the
sepulchre
some
answered
lazarus
the
industrious
scribe
others
said
a
young
man
who
has
devoted
his
life
to
honor
his
mother
others
answered
as
lazarus
himself
were
he
alive
would
have
had
them
it
is
lazarus
the
friend
of
jesus
the
place
where
they
were
to
lay
him
was
the
cave
in
which
his
father
and
mother
were
entombed
it
was
in
a
deep
shady
vale
thickly
shaded
by
cypress
palm
and
pomegranate
trees
and
a
large
tamarind
grew
with
its
stately
branches
overclasping
the
summit
of
the
secluded
place
of
sepulchre
the
remote
swell
of
a
roman
bugle
from
the
head
of
a
cohort
which
was
just
issuing
from
a
defile
came
softly
and
musically
to
our
ears
as
we
stood
in
silence
about
the
grove
wherein
we
were
to
place
the
dead
æmilius
my
betrothed
was
also
present
wearing
a
white
scarf
above
his
silver
cuirass
in
token
of
grief
for
he
also
loved
lazarus
of
him
dear
father
i
have
not
of
late
spoken
for
should
i
begin
to
write
of
him
i
should
have
no
room
in
my
letters
for
any
other
theme
the
sacred
observances
at
the
grove
being
over
they
raised
the
body
of
the
dead
young
man
from
the
bier
and
four
youths
aided
by
æmilius
at
the
head
to
support
it
conveyed
it
into
the
yawning
cavern
a
moment
they
lingered
on
the
threshold
that
mary
and
martha
might
take
one
more
look
imprint
upon
its
icy
cold
lips
one
last
kiss
press
once
more
his
unconscious
head
to
their
loving
and
bursting
hearts
the
young
men
moved
slowly
forward
into
the
gloom
of
the
cave
mary
rushed
in
and
with
disheveled
hair
cried
oh
take
him
not
away
forever
from
the
sight
of
my
eyes
oh
my
brother
my
brother
would
that
i
had
died
for
thee
for
i
am
willing
to
lie
down
with
the
worm
and
call
it
my
sister
and
sleep
in
the
arms
of
death
as
on
the
breast
of
my
mother
so
thou
couldst
live
oh
brother
brother
let
them
not
take
thee
forever
from
the
sight
of
my
eyes
without
thee
how
shall
life
be
life
illustration
rolling
stone
closing
a
sepulchre
æmilius
entered
the
tomb
and
tenderly
raising
her
from
the
body
on
which
she
had
cast
herself
in
the
eloquent
abandonment
of
her
wild
grief
he
led
her
forth
and
beckoning
to
me
placed
her
in
my
arms
the
body
being
placed
in
a
niche
hollowed
out
in
the
rock
was
decently
covered
with
a
grave
mantle
all
but
the
calm
face
which
was
bound
about
by
a
napkin
maidens
of
the
village
advanced
and
cast
flowers
upon
his
head
and
many
many
were
the
sincere
tears
both
from
beneath
manly
lids
and
those
of
virgins
which
bore
tribute
to
his
worth
the
burial
ceremonies
being
ended
five
strong
men
replaced
the
ponderous
stone
door
closely
fitting
the
entrance
to
the
cave
and
so
secured
it
by
letting
it
into
a
socket
that
it
would
require
a
like
number
to
remove
it
as
they
were
retiring
with
heavy
hearts
from
performing
this
last
duty
to
the
beloved
dead
the
sun
sank
beyond
the
blue
hills
of
ajalon
in
the
west
in
a
lake
of
gold
to
enjoy
the
sunset
and
to
relieve
our
emotions
of
sadness
i
walked
apart
with
mary
to
the
top
of
the
hill
from
which
i
beheld
the
sun
gilding
the
pinnacle
of
the
temple
and
making
it
appear
like
a
gigantic
spear
elevated
into
the
sky
from
the
levites
at
evening
sacrifice
came
mellowed
by
distance
the
deep
chant
of
the
temple
service
uttered
by
a
thousand
voices
the
cloud
from
the
altar
sacrifice
ascended
slowly
into
the
still
air
and
catching
the
splendor
of
the
sun
last
beams
shone
as
if
the
pillar
of
cloud
and
of
fire
which
stood
above
the
tabernacle
in
the
wilderness
the
laborers
in
the
harvest
were
hastening
towards
the
gates
ere
they
should
be
shut
out
for
the
night
by
the
roman
guards
and
dwellers
in
the
village
were
hurrying
forth
lest
they
should
be
held
in
the
city
over
night
there
was
a
sacred
hush
in
the
sleepy
atmosphere
that
seemed
in
sympathy
and
touching
harmony
with
the
scene
in
which
we
had
just
borne
a
part
with
mary
leaning
sobbing
upon
my
shoulder
i
sat
upon
a
rock
giving
my
heart
up
to
the
sweet
influences
of
the
hour
we
were
alone
save
æmilius
who
had
ridden
after
us
anxious
for
our
safety
and
who
sat
upon
his
horse
near
by
gazing
upon
the
beauty
of
the
evening
scene
i
am
calmer
now
said
mary
after
a
while
raising
her
head
and
looking
into
my
face
her
splendid
eyes
glittering
brimful
with
tears
the
peace
of
the
sweet
holy
skies
seems
to
have
descended
and
entered
my
heart
the
spirit
of
lazarus
pervades
all
and
hallows
all
i
see
i
will
weep
no
more
he
is
happy
now
very
happy
and
let
us
try
to
be
holy
and
go
to
him
for
he
can
not
come
back
to
us
at
this
moment
we
heard
the
tramp
of
horses
hoofs
æmilius
startled
thereby
from
his
reverie
recovered
his
seat
and
laid
his
hand
upon
his
sword
the
next
moment
around
a
rock
projecting
from
the
shoulder
of
olivet
appeared
a
horseman
in
the
wild
warlike
costume
of
an
ishmaelite
of
the
desert
brandishing
a
long
spear
in
the
air
then
another
and
another
similarly
clad
and
armed
and
mounted
on
superb
horses
of
the
desert
dashed
in
sight
these
were
immediately
followed
by
a
tall
young
man
in
a
rich
costume
half
grecian
half
arabic
though
his
dark
handsome
features
were
decidedly
israelitish
he
rode
a
superb
abyssinian
charger
and
sat
upon
his
back
like
the
heathen
centaur
i
have
read
of
in
the
latin
books
which
æmilius
has
given
me
to
read
upon
seeing
us
he
drew
rein
and
smiled
and
waved
his
jewelled
hand
with
splendid
courtesy
but
at
the
sight
of
æmilius
his
dark
eyes
flashed
and
leaping
to
his
feet
in
his
stirrups
he
shook
his
glittering
falchion
towards
him
and
rode
with
a
cry
full
upon
him
the
brave
roman
soldier
received
the
charge
by
turning
his
horse
slightly
and
catching
the
point
of
the
weapon
upon
the
blade
of
his
short
sword
we
meet
at
last
o
roman
cried
this
wild
dashing
chief
as
he
wheeled
his
horse
like
lightning
and
once
more
rode
upon
the
roman
knight
ay
barabbas
and
with
joy
i
hail
thee
responded
æmilius
placing
a
bugle
to
his
lips
at
hearing
the
clear
voice
of
the
bugle
awaking
the
echoes
of
olivet
the
dread
robber
chief
said
haughtily
and
with
a
glance
of
contempt
thou
a
knight
of
the
tribune
and
commander
of
a
legion
call
for
aid
when
i
offer
thee
equal
battle
hand
to
hand
and
ask
not
for
aid
of
my
own
men
spears
i
know
no
equal
battle
with
a
robber
i
would
hunt
thee
as
i
would
do
the
wolf
and
the
wild
beasts
of
thy
deserts
answered
æmilius
pressing
him
closely
at
a
signal
from
the
robber
chief
his
four
men
who
had
reined
up
a
short
distance
off
near
the
tomb
of
lazarus
sent
up
a
shrill
eaglelike
scream
that
made
my
blood
stand
still
and
then
rode
down
like
the
wind
to
overcome
æmilius
hitherto
i
had
remained
as
one
stupefied
at
being
an
involuntary
spectator
of
a
sudden
battle
but
on
seeing
his
danger
i
was
at
his
side
scarce
knowing
how
i
reached
the
place
retire
dear
adina
he
said
authoritatively
i
shall
have
to
defend
both
thee
and
myself
and
these
barbarians
will
give
both
my
hands
enough
to
do
as
he
spoke
he
turned
his
horse
head
to
meet
the
forefold
shock
and
i
escaped
i
know
not
how
with
the
impulse
to
hasten
to
bethany
for
succor
but
heaven
interposed
its
aid
a
detachment
of
the
of
pilate
hearing
the
recall
of
their
chief
bugle
came
now
cantering
up
the
hill
at
the
sight
barabbas
and
his
party
fled
like
wild
pigeons
pursued
by
a
cloud
of
iturean
hawks
barabbas
however
turned
more
than
once
to
fling
back
defiance
to
his
foes
æmilius
soon
reached
his
side
seized
the
crimson
sash
which
encircled
his
waist
and
held
him
thus
both
fighting
as
they
rode
the
roman
troop
came
up
and
after
a
desperate
battle
the
celebrated
chief
was
taken
alive
though
bleeding
with
many
wounds
and
bound
with
his
own
sash
to
the
column
of
one
of
the
tombs
æmilius
says
that
barabbas
will
assuredly
be
crucified
for
his
numerous
crimes
dreadful
punishment
and
for
one
so
young
as
this
desert
robber
to
come
to
such
an
ignominious
and
agonizing
death
doomed
to
hang
for
hours
under
the
sunbeams
by
his
lacerated
hands
and
feet
till
death
at
last
comes
from
slow
exhaustion
of
all
the
powers
of
nature
i
am
amazed
that
so
polite
and
humane
a
nation
as
the
roman
can
inflict
such
a
cruel
and
agonizing
death
even
upon
their
malefactors
ignominious
indeed
must
the
life
of
a
man
have
been
for
him
to
be
doomed
justly
to
suffer
such
a
death
in
this
letter
dearest
father
i
intended
to
relate
to
you
how
lazarus
has
been
restored
to
life
but
it
is
already
taken
up
with
so
much
that
i
defer
it
to
my
next
suffice
it
for
me
to
tell
you
at
the
close
of
this
letter
that
it
was
jesus
who
raised
him
from
the
dead
and
will
you
say
that
he
is
an
impostor
that
he
has
done
this
wonderful
thing
is
alone
evidence
enough
to
me
that
he
is
indeed
the
messias
of
the
prophets
the
son
of
god
your
affectionate
daughter
adina
letter
xxvii
my
dear
father
your
letter
has
filled
me
with
joy
that
i
can
poorly
express
by
my
pen
it
assures
me
that
you
are
certain
to
leave
at
the
new
moon
and
after
a
few
days
delay
at
gaza
that
you
will
be
with
me
not
many
days
afterward
this
letter
i
shall
send
to
meet
you
at
gaza
in
it
i
shall
make
known
to
you
the
particulars
of
the
greatest
miracle
of
power
and
love
above
all
those
wonders
which
jesus
has
done
when
mary
and
martha
had
despatched
the
message
to
jesus
as
i
have
already
stated
they
began
to
be
more
cheerful
with
hope
saying
if
our
dear
rabbi
the
holy
prophet
comes
he
will
heal
him
with
a
word
as
he
has
done
so
many
of
the
sick
yes
many
whom
he
knew
not
he
has
restored
to
health
by
a
touch
remarked
martha
how
much
more
lazarus
whom
he
loves
as
a
brother
oh
that
the
messenger
may
press
forward
with
all
haste
if
lazarus
should
die
ere
he
come
hesitatingly
remarked
my
gentle
cousin
the
wife
of
john
the
disciple
he
could
bring
him
to
life
again
even
as
he
did
the
son
of
the
widow
of
nain
yes
without
doubt
unless
it
were
too
late
remarked
martha
shrinking
at
the
thought
that
her
brother
should
die
but
if
he
be
long
dead
it
will
be
impossible
nothing
is
impossible
with
jesus
answered
mary
her
eyes
brightening
with
trusting
faith
thus
the
hours
passed
between
mingled
hopes
and
fears
but
ere
jesus
came
lo
the
mantle
of
death
was
laid
over
the
face
of
their
dead
brother
lazarus
is
dead
and
jesus
is
far
away
was
the
bitter
and
touching
cry
made
by
the
bereaved
sisters
as
they
wept
in
each
arms
the
next
day
the
burial
took
place
and
yet
no
messenger
came
from
jesus
the
morning
of
the
third
day
the
man
returned
and
said
that
he
had
found
the
prophet
on
the
farther
bank
of
jordan
where
john
had
baptized
abiding
in
a
humble
cottage
in
the
suburbs
of
bethabara
with
his
disciples
the
bearer
of
the
sad
tidings
from
the
two
sisters
delivered
his
simple
and
touching
message
lord
behold
he
whom
thou
lovest
is
sick
and
what
said
he
how
did
his
countenance
appear
asked
martha
of
the
man
he
betrayed
no
surprise
but
said
calmly
to
me
i
know
it
this
sickness
shall
not
be
unto
death
it
shall
be
for
the
glory
of
god
for
hereby
will
my
father
permit
me
to
be
glorified
that
men
may
see
and
believe
truly
that
i
came
out
from
god
alas
he
knew
not
how
ill
his
friend
was
said
mary
or
he
would
not
have
said
it
was
not
unto
death
and
would
surely
have
hastened
with
you
he
has
forgotten
us
answered
martha
he
should
be
here
to
console
us
in
our
deep
affliction
though
he
came
not
to
heal
our
brother
nay
sister
do
not
think
hardly
of
the
blessed
friend
of
lazarus
said
mary
with
soothing
tones
as
she
caressed
her
elder
sister
i
feel
that
if
he
had
seen
fit
he
could
have
raised
up
our
brother
even
speaking
the
word
from
bethabara
it
was
not
needful
he
should
see
him
to
heal
him
for
dost
thou
remember
how
he
healed
lucius
the
centurion
son
yet
at
the
time
he
was
a
day
journey
distant
from
him
then
why
oh
why
did
he
not
save
lazarus
exclaimed
martha
bitterly
in
that
he
did
not
sweet
sister
answered
mary
gently
it
was
for
the
best
did
he
not
say
to
the
messenger
his
sickness
should
be
to
the
glory
of
his
power
but
not
his
death
mary
not
his
death
he
is
dead
four
days
already
and
how
can
the
grave
give
glory
to
the
power
of
jesus
will
he
raise
him
up
since
corruption
hath
begun
nay
begun
ere
we
laid
him
in
the
cold
sepulchre
oh
speak
not
to
me
of
the
prophet
he
loved
not
lazarus
or
he
had
not
the
power
to
save
him
nay
leave
me
mary
to
the
bitterness
of
my
grief
ah
dear
martha
how
soon
is
thy
faith
in
jesus
when
tried
become
naught
said
mary
bending
upon
her
from
her
dark
earnest
eyes
looks
of
sad
reproach
shall
one
day
overturn
your
years
of
holy
friendship
for
him
because
he
answered
not
our
prayer
to
come
to
lazarus
think
you
he
loved
him
not
and
is
indifferent
to
our
anguish
he
is
wronged
by
your
reproof
and
injured
by
your
want
of
confidence
in
his
love
and
care
for
us
while
they
were
thus
discoursing
one
came
running
swiftly
towards
the
house
and
breathless
with
haste
cried
to
them
and
to
the
jews
sitting
there
who
had
come
to
comfort
them
concerning
their
brother
the
prophet
the
nazarene
he
comes
almost
at
the
same
moment
elec
the
gibeonite
entered
and
said
jesus
messias
of
god
is
at
hand
he
already
entereth
the
village
followed
by
his
disciples
at
this
intelligence
the
mourners
who
sat
with
mary
and
martha
in
the
vine
porch
rose
up
to
go
and
meet
him
but
martha
shrieking
with
the
reaction
of
sudden
joy
sprang
up
and
more
quickly
than
they
reached
the
street
and
flying
with
great
speed
came
where
jesus
was
mary
who
had
received
the
news
without
betraying
any
other
emotion
than
the
secret
and
holy
joy
of
a
heart
that
had
confidence
all
along
in
her
lord
instead
of
hastening
to
meet
him
rending
her
hair
with
grief
like
her
sister
proceeded
to
prepare
a
room
for
the
hospitable
entertainment
of
the
beloved
prophet
when
he
should
come
in
thus
taking
martha
usual
place
and
when
she
had
arranged
all
she
sat
down
with
me
in
the
house
her
heart
filled
with
joy
and
her
face
expressive
of
calm
and
quiet
happiness
when
martha
had
come
near
jesus
whom
she
met
just
entering
bethany
walking
with
four
of
his
disciples
along
the
dusty
road
and
looking
weary
and
she
ran
and
threw
herself
at
his
feet
crying
lord
if
thou
hadst
been
here
my
brother
had
not
died
jesus
taking
her
hand
raised
her
up
and
said
with
emotion
for
he
seemed
deeply
moved
by
her
grief
death
to
those
whom
my
father
loveth
is
sleep
the
good
die
not
lazarus
is
not
dead
but
sleepeth
and
he
shall
rise
again
i
know
o
rabboni
that
he
shall
rise
again
in
the
resurrection
at
the
last
day
jesus
then
said
to
her
lifting
his
celestial
glances
towards
heaven
i
am
the
resurrection
and
the
life
he
that
believeth
in
me
though
he
were
dead
yet
shall
he
live
and
whosoever
liveth
and
believeth
in
me
shall
never
die
believest
thou
this
daughter
yea
lord
i
believe
that
thou
art
the
christ
the
son
of
god
which
should
come
into
the
world
i
know
that
whatsoever
thou
wilt
ask
of
god
god
will
give
it
thee
and
that
even
now
thou
couldst
bring
lazarus
back
again
corruption
and
the
worm
have
begun
their
work
said
a
proud
and
unbelieving
pharisee
near
on
hearing
this
whatever
may
have
been
the
state
of
the
ruler
daughter
and
of
the
son
of
her
of
nain
lazarus
the
scribe
at
least
is
dead
to
this
speech
jesus
made
no
reply
but
turning
to
martha
said
softly
this
day
my
father
shall
be
glorified
and
the
world
shall
truly
know
that
i
am
come
from
him
who
is
life
and
the
giver
of
life
go
thou
and
tell
thy
sister
that
i
am
here
and
would
have
her
come
and
speak
with
me
martha
then
overjoyed
and
wondering
that
jesus
should
have
known
her
thoughts
so
as
to
reproach
her
for
her
little
faith
as
he
had
done
hastened
to
her
sister
and
entering
cried
i
have
seen
the
lord
he
calleth
for
thee
mary
come
and
see
him
as
he
sits
by
isaiah
fountain
near
the
mary
rose
quickly
and
went
out
certain
of
her
jewish
friends
from
jerusalem
at
that
moment
met
her
at
the
door
and
began
to
comfort
her
and
to
ask
her
if
they
also
should
go
with
her
to
weep
at
the
grave
of
lazarus
for
they
said
one
to
another
she
goes
unto
the
grave
to
weep
there
she
goes
to
see
jesus
the
friend
of
lazarus
for
he
calleth
her
answered
martha
smiling
with
eagerness
and
speaking
with
an
animation
that
presented
a
singular
contrast
to
her
late
deep
grief
mary
hastened
to
where
jesus
sat
by
the
fountain
bathing
his
dusty
and
wounded
feet
lord
she
said
in
her
sister
words
and
with
deep
emotion
if
thou
lord
hadst
been
here
my
brother
had
not
died
then
bowing
her
head
to
the
edge
of
the
marble
basin
she
wept
very
heavily
the
jews
men
and
women
who
stood
about
being
touched
with
her
sorrow
also
wept
while
glittering
tears
coursed
their
way
down
the
face
of
the
beloved
john
his
disciple
who
stood
near
jesus
sighed
deeply
and
groaned
in
spirit
as
he
beheld
her
grief
and
their
mourning
with
her
his
sacred
countenance
was
marred
with
the
anguish
of
his
soul
rise
let
us
go
to
the
grave
where
he
lieth
he
said
to
them
where
have
ye
laid
him
come
dear
lord
and
see
answered
mary
holding
him
reverently
by
the
sleeve
of
the
robe
and
gently
yet
eagerly
drawing
him
towards
the
place
of
the
tombs
in
the
vale
of
olivet
in
the
meanwhile
at
home
martha
had
been
diligently
and
with
strange
cheerfulness
getting
in
readiness
the
room
of
lazarus
she
swept
and
dusted
it
and
garnished
it
with
fresh
flowers
which
she
gathered
in
the
little
garden
this
is
the
rose
he
set
out
and
loved
this
is
the
violet
which
blooms
immortal
i
will
place
it
upon
his
pillow
she
said
with
a
joyous
hilarity
softened
by
the
most
lovely
look
of
peace
while
hope
shone
in
her
eyes
like
twin
morning
stars
ushering
in
a
glorious
day
she
spoke
scarcely
above
her
breath
and
moved
on
tiptoe
for
whom
is
this
preparation
dearest
martha
for
jesus
i
asked
oh
no
the
holy
prophet
own
room
is
ready
mary
has
prepared
that
this
is
lazarus
room
and
i
am
decorating
it
for
him
dost
thou
truly
believe
that
he
is
coming
back
from
the
dead
i
asked
between
doubt
and
strange
fear
believe
oh
yes
i
know
that
nothing
is
impossible
with
jesus
i
doubt
no
more
my
faith
trembles
no
longer
he
will
raise
up
my
brother
and
this
day
he
shall
sit
down
at
our
table
with
us
again
and
this
night
rest
his
head
in
peaceful
slumber
upon
this
pillow
which
i
am
strewing
with
his
favorite
flowers
never
had
house
two
such
guests
as
we
shall
have
this
day
the
messias
of
god
and
one
come
back
alive
from
the
dead
at
this
moment
we
heard
the
noise
of
the
multitude
passing
by
and
it
being
told
us
that
jesus
was
going
to
the
grave
martha
embracing
me
with
a
heavenly
smile
drew
me
gently
after
her
to
follow
the
blessed
prophet
to
the
tomb
all
bethany
was
in
his
footsteps
how
shall
i
describe
jesus
as
he
then
appeared
he
wore
a
blue
robe
woven
without
seam
throughout
the
affectionate
work
and
gift
of
the
two
sisters
his
face
was
very
pale
and
sad
yet
a
certain
divine
majesty
rested
thereon
so
that
his
calm
high
forehead
looked
as
if
it
were
a
throne
his
holy
earnest
eyes
were
full
of
sorrow
his
mouth
compressed
betrayed
the
effort
he
made
to
suppress
the
outbursting
of
his
heart
deep
grief
slowly
he
moved
onward
and
entering
the
cemetery
he
soon
stood
before
the
tomb
of
his
beloved
friend
for
a
few
moments
he
stood
gazing
upon
the
closed
stone
door
of
the
cave
in
silence
there
reigned
an
expectant
hush
among
the
vast
throng
mary
knelt
at
his
feet
gazing
up
into
his
countenance
with
a
sublime
expression
of
hope
and
trust
martha
drew
softly
near
and
fell
upon
her
knees
by
the
side
of
her
sister
jesus
looked
tenderly
upon
them
and
resting
his
eyes
upon
the
tomb
wept
large
glittering
tears
rolled
down
his
cheeks
and
glanced
from
his
flowing
beard
to
the
ground
i
knelt
by
the
side
of
the
sisters
behold
how
he
loved
him
whispered
the
jews
present
with
surprise
others
said
could
not
this
man
which
opened
the
eyes
of
the
blind
have
caused
that
even
this
man
should
not
have
died
jesus
heaving
a
deep
sigh
now
came
nearer
the
grave
with
a
slight
movement
of
his
right
hand
to
those
who
stood
by
he
said
in
a
tone
that
though
low
was
heard
by
the
whole
people
so
solemn
was
the
surrounding
stillness
take
ye
away
the
stone
lord
said
martha
by
this
time
the
body
is
offensive
for
he
hath
been
dead
four
days
daughter
said
jesus
looking
on
her
believe
and
thou
shalt
behold
the
power
of
god
the
men
then
with
some
difficulty
took
away
the
stone
from
the
door
of
the
sepulchre
and
stood
upon
one
side
the
dark
vault
yawned
with
gloomy
horrors
and
so
corrupt
was
the
air
that
rushed
out
all
fell
back
from
it
save
jesus
and
mary
retiring
several
steps
from
the
entrance
jesus
stood
looking
into
the
cave
where
as
our
eyes
became
accustomed
to
the
darkness
within
we
could
discern
the
corpse
of
lazarus
covered
with
the
grave
mantle
and
his
face
bound
with
a
napkin
which
was
already
discolored
with
the
sepulchral
damp
of
the
grave
raising
his
hands
towards
heaven
and
lifting
up
his
spiritual
eyes
which
were
yet
moist
with
tears
jesus
spoke
in
a
voice
of
indescribable
pathos
and
earnestness
of
appeal
and
with
a
manner
of
the
most
awful
reverence
as
follows
father
i
thank
thee
that
thou
hast
heard
me
and
i
know
that
thou
hearest
me
always
but
because
of
the
people
which
stand
by
do
i
offer
unto
thee
this
prayer
that
they
may
believe
that
the
power
i
have
cometh
from
thee
and
that
they
may
believe
that
thou
hast
sent
me
and
now
o
holy
father
may
i
glorify
thee
on
the
earth
with
the
power
which
thou
hast
given
me
he
then
turned
towards
the
tomb
and
stretching
forth
his
hand
he
cried
with
a
loud
voice
that
made
every
heart
quake
lazarus
come
forth
my
blood
stood
still
in
my
veins
scarcely
daring
to
behold
i
looked
and
beheld
what
all
eyes
also
saw
the
corpse
rise
and
stand
up
within
the
vault
turn
round
with
its
face
towards
us
and
come
forth
wrapped
hand
and
foot
with
the
and
his
face
bound
about
with
a
napkin
his
countenance
was
like
marble
for
whiteness
and
his
eyes
which
were
open
beamed
supernaturally
brilliant
at
beholding
him
a
simultaneous
shriek
burst
from
the
lips
of
the
people
and
there
was
a
terrified
backward
rush
of
all
who
were
nighest
the
cave
martha
wildly
uttering
her
brother
name
fell
forward
upon
her
face
insensible
loose
him
and
let
him
go
free
said
jesus
calmly
addressing
the
petrified
and
amazed
men
who
had
taken
away
the
stone
mary
was
the
first
one
who
had
the
firmness
to
approach
him
and
as
she
began
removing
the
napkin
from
the
sides
of
his
face
others
taking
courage
by
her
example
hastened
to
unswathe
his
arms
and
feet
in
a
few
moments
he
was
free
from
his
outer
and
the
healthful
color
of
his
cheeks
coming
to
him
his
lips
flushed
brilliantly
with
red
his
eyes
looked
natural
beaming
with
wonder
and
love
as
he
gazed
about
him
perceiving
jesus
he
was
about
to
cast
himself
at
his
feet
in
gratitude
for
he
seemed
to
have
consciousness
of
all
that
had
happened
but
the
mighty
prophet
drew
him
to
his
embrace
and
kissed
him
but
my
pen
refuses
to
find
language
to
express
the
unspeakable
emotions
of
joy
and
gratitude
words
of
love
and
praise
that
filled
all
hearts
now
the
great
prophet
now
lazarus
and
now
jesus
again
received
the
plaudits
of
the
vast
throng
of
people
hymns
were
chanted
to
jehovah
as
we
passed
through
the
streets
and
so
many
fell
down
to
worship
jesus
that
it
was
long
before
we
crossed
the
threshold
of
the
dwelling
which
jesus
did
indeed
enter
with
lazarus
by
his
side
and
martha
did
see
her
brother
sit
at
the
table
and
that
night
his
head
rested
in
deep
slumber
upon
the
pillow
which
her
faith
and
love
had
prepared
for
him
with
the
hope
of
soon
embracing
you
i
remain
as
ever
your
loving
daughter
adina
letter
xxviii
my
dear
father
like
all
my
letters
the
theme
of
this
will
be
jesus
whose
claims
to
be
the
messiah
i
unspeakably
rejoice
to
hear
you
are
beginning
to
regard
with
more
favorable
eyes
now
jesus
whose
power
to
work
miracles
you
yourself
my
dear
father
have
confessed
must
be
conferred
by
jehovah
alone
asserts
distinctly
and
everywhere
that
he
is
messias
the
son
of
god
the
shiloh
of
israel
of
whom
moses
and
the
prophets
so
eloquently
wrote
besides
claiming
for
himself
this
high
character
he
was
heard
by
both
my
uncle
amos
and
myself
in
the
synagogue
at
bethany
two
days
after
he
raised
lazarus
from
the
dead
to
read
from
esaias
the
words
following
and
apply
them
to
himself
which
he
had
done
before
at
nazareth
the
spirit
of
the
lord
is
upon
me
because
he
hath
anointed
me
to
preach
the
gospel
to
the
poor
he
hath
sent
me
to
heal
the
to
preach
deliverance
to
the
captives
and
recovering
of
sight
to
the
blind
to
set
at
liberty
them
that
are
bruised
to
preach
the
acceptable
year
of
the
lord
the
synagogue
was
thronged
so
that
people
trod
upon
one
another
all
eyes
were
now
intent
and
all
ears
were
ready
to
hear
what
he
should
speak
he
then
said
unto
them
this
day
is
this
scripture
fulfilled
in
your
ears
ye
ask
me
o
scribes
and
men
of
israel
to
tell
you
plainly
who
i
am
whether
i
am
the
christ
or
no
what
saith
the
prophet
of
messias
when
he
shall
come
ye
have
just
heard
his
words
if
such
works
as
he
prophesieth
do
show
forth
themselves
in
me
know
ye
not
who
i
am
here
a
voice
cried
out
in
the
assembly
tell
us
plainly
art
thou
the
christ
the
son
of
the
highest
at
this
direct
inquiry
there
was
intense
interest
shown
to
hear
the
reply
jesus
seemed
about
to
answer
when
a
man
who
stood
near
the
reading
desk
in
whom
was
an
unclean
spirit
cried
out
with
a
shrieking
voice
of
mingled
terror
and
awe
let
me
alone
leave
me
as
i
am
thou
jesus
of
nazareth
art
thou
come
hither
to
destroy
me
i
know
thee
who
thou
art
the
holy
one
of
god
jesus
rebuked
the
devil
which
possessed
the
man
and
said
in
the
voice
of
a
master
commanding
a
bond
slave
hold
thy
peace
satan
the
son
of
man
needeth
not
though
thou
givest
it
thy
testimony
hold
thy
peace
and
come
out
of
the
man
at
this
word
the
man
uttered
a
fearful
cry
of
despair
and
rage
and
foaming
at
the
mouth
cast
himself
or
rather
was
thrown
down
by
the
devil
within
him
to
the
ground
where
after
a
moment
terrific
struggle
with
contortions
of
bodily
anguish
he
lay
senseless
as
if
dead
jesus
took
him
by
the
hand
and
he
stood
up
and
looking
in
the
face
of
the
prophet
with
earnestness
and
wonder
burst
into
tears
of
gratitude
exclaiming
i
am
escaped
as
a
bird
out
of
the
snare
of
the
fowler
the
snare
is
broken
and
i
am
escaped
god
hath
delivered
me
out
of
the
hand
of
my
enemy
he
then
sat
at
the
feet
of
jesus
calm
grateful
happy
and
in
his
right
mind
all
gazed
on
him
with
wonder
while
from
the
great
mass
of
the
people
rose
a
great
shout
for
they
were
all
amazed
saying
this
is
none
other
than
the
christ
the
son
of
david
this
is
the
king
of
israel
while
the
loud
shouts
of
hosanna
hosanna
hosanna
cheered
by
a
thousand
voices
hosanna
to
our
king
shook
like
a
passing
storm
the
synagogue
when
the
noise
had
a
little
subsided
some
of
the
scribes
and
pharisees
said
reproving
him
for
not
rebuking
these
cries
who
is
this
that
suffereth
himself
to
be
hailed
as
king
this
is
treason
to
the
emperor
jesus
then
said
in
a
loud
clear
voice
my
kingdom
is
not
of
this
world
i
seek
not
an
earthly
throne
or
earthly
sceptre
my
kingdom
is
from
above
ye
say
truly
i
am
king
he
added
with
indescribable
majesty
and
hereafter
ye
shall
behold
me
sitting
upon
the
throne
of
heaven
when
he
had
thus
far
spoken
he
could
not
proceed
farther
on
account
of
the
sudden
and
immense
uproar
which
his
words
produced
some
shouted
hosanna
others
said
he
blasphemed
one
cried
for
the
roman
guard
another
for
the
priests
to
eject
him
from
the
tribune
many
rushed
towards
him
to
cast
themselves
at
his
feet
while
many
putting
their
fingers
in
their
ears
hurried
forth
from
the
synagogue
crying
his
blasphemies
will
cause
the
house
to
fall
upon
us
and
crush
us
never
was
such
an
uproar
heard
in
the
midst
of
it
jesus
conveyed
himself
away
none
knew
whither
and
when
i
returned
to
the
house
of
martha
i
heard
his
low
earnest
touching
voice
in
prayer
to
god
in
his
little
chamber
he
had
sought
its
sacred
quiet
to
be
alone
with
his
father
in
heaven
at
times
i
could
hear
him
praying
and
supplicating
in
tones
of
the
most
pathos
at
others
the
silence
of
his
room
was
only
broken
at
intervals
by
sighs
and
pitiful
groans
that
seemed
to
come
from
a
breaking
and
crushed
heart
oh
what
hand
may
remove
the
veil
and
reveal
what
passed
there
in
that
holy
retirement
between
the
prophet
and
his
god
it
was
late
in
the
day
when
he
came
forth
martha
having
softly
tapped
at
his
door
to
say
that
the
evening
meal
was
prepared
and
alone
waited
for
him
when
he
appeared
his
face
was
colorless
and
bore
traces
of
weeping
and
though
he
smiled
kindly
upon
us
all
as
he
was
wont
to
do
there
was
a
sorrow
upon
his
countenance
that
brought
tears
to
my
eyes
æmilius
joined
us
at
the
table
and
with
dear
lazarus
and
with
uncle
amos
we
passed
a
sacred
hour
for
the
prophet
ate
not
but
talked
to
us
much
and
sweetly
of
the
love
of
god
and
as
all
listened
the
viands
were
forgotten
pardon
me
dearest
father
if
i
am
too
warm
and
urgent
in
my
efforts
to
bring
you
to
accept
jesus
as
the
christ
convinced
as
i
am
that
he
is
messias
i
can
not
but
ardently
desire
that
you
also
should
come
to
the
knowledge
of
this
truth
what
he
is
yet
to
be
how
he
is
yet
to
develop
his
majesty
and
power
is
unknown
to
us
all
some
do
think
that
he
will
enter
jerusalem
ere
long
attended
by
tens
of
thousands
of
his
followers
and
that
before
him
pilate
will
peaceably
vacate
his
procuratorial
chair
and
retire
not
only
from
the
holy
city
but
from
judea
with
his
legions
that
jesus
will
ascend
the
throne
of
david
and
the
glory
of
the
age
of
solomon
be
revived
under
his
rule
such
dear
father
is
the
future
of
the
prophet
as
looked
for
by
all
his
disciples
save
one
and
this
is
john
the
husband
of
my
cousin
mary
john
on
hearing
our
views
of
the
coming
glory
of
the
prophet
looks
compassionate
and
says
his
kingdom
is
not
of
this
world
he
has
naught
to
do
with
the
splendors
of
earth
his
glory
you
will
behold
but
it
is
a
glory
of
the
spirit
ere
perceiving
it
fully
we
may
first
pass
through
the
valley
of
darkness
the
gate
of
the
tomb
he
has
distinctly
said
to
me
must
first
suffer
many
things
at
the
hands
of
men
before
i
enter
upon
my
reign
of
glory
the
jews
will
seek
me
to
kill
me
and
i
shall
be
taken
from
among
you
but
let
not
sorrow
fill
your
hearts
death
can
have
no
power
over
me
save
such
as
i
permit
it
to
hold
i
lay
down
my
life
and
i
take
it
again
through
much
tribulation
and
sorrow
must
the
son
of
god
win
the
sceptre
of
this
earth
the
hearts
of
men
i
shall
conquer
but
to
do
so
i
must
fall
yet
fear
not
my
death
shall
be
the
gateway
to
paradise
for
you
all
thus
dear
father
do
we
discourse
together
about
this
wonderful
prophet
whose
future
life
is
all
a
mystery
save
that
from
the
prophecies
we
know
it
is
to
be
inconceivably
glorious
from
his
own
lips
to
be
inconceivably
sorrowful
but
whether
on
a
throne
giving
laws
to
the
world
or
in
the
dust
borne
down
by
the
deepest
woe
i
shall
still
love
honor
reverence
him
and
trust
in
him
as
my
savior
my
prince
and
the
holy
one
of
god
your
devoted
and
loving
adina
letter
xxix
my
dearest
father
with
what
emotions
of
grief
and
amazement
i
commence
this
letter
you
can
form
no
just
conception
jesus
the
prophet
of
god
is
a
prisoner
to
the
roman
power
but
i
fear
not
the
issue
he
can
not
be
holden
of
his
foes
save
by
his
own
free
will
he
can
with
a
word
turn
his
chains
into
bands
of
sand
and
by
a
glance
render
his
guards
dead
men
he
will
therefore
escape
their
bonds
they
can
have
no
power
over
him
it
seems
that
after
eating
the
passover
with
his
twelve
chosen
friends
and
instituting
a
new
and
peculiar
feast
with
wine
and
bread
which
he
told
them
impressively
would
be
his
last
supper
with
them
he
went
forth
towards
olivet
and
there
seating
himself
beneath
the
shade
of
a
tree
he
talked
with
them
very
sadly
saying
that
his
hour
was
come
that
he
had
ended
his
work
and
that
he
was
about
to
be
delivered
into
the
hands
of
sinful
men
john
gave
the
following
narrative
it
was
evening
and
the
south
side
of
olivet
lay
in
deep
shadow
we
were
all
sorrowful
we
felt
each
one
of
us
as
if
some
grievous
evil
was
pending
over
us
the
tones
of
our
beloved
master
voice
moved
us
to
tears
quite
as
much
as
his
words
which
latter
were
full
of
mystery
we
were
all
present
except
iscariot
who
had
remained
in
the
city
to
discharge
the
costs
he
being
our
of
the
passover
supper
and
pay
for
the
hire
of
the
room
at
that
supper
jesus
had
said
very
plainly
that
one
of
our
number
would
betray
him
into
the
hands
of
the
priests
at
hearing
our
lord
say
these
strange
words
in
accents
of
touching
reproach
we
were
all
deeply
moved
and
peter
and
the
rest
at
once
questioned
him
individually
if
it
were
they
is
it
i
and
another
is
it
i
i
was
resting
at
the
moment
with
my
face
on
the
shoulder
of
jesus
and
said
softly
who
is
it
that
betrayeth
thee
i
will
forthwith
lay
hands
upon
him
and
prevent
his
doing
thee
harm
jesus
shook
his
head
and
smiling
gently
said
beloved
brother
thou
knowest
not
what
thou
would
do
the
son
of
man
must
needs
be
betrayed
by
his
own
friends
but
woe
unto
him
who
betrayeth
me
mark
which
of
the
twelve
dippeth
bread
with
me
into
the
dish
i
looked
and
saw
judas
reach
forward
and
dip
into
the
dish
at
the
same
instant
with
jesus
but
in
his
eagerness
or
from
conscious
guilt
his
hand
trembled
he
spilled
the
salt
over
the
board
and
the
sop
fell
from
his
grasp
into
the
bowl
upon
which
jesus
gave
him
the
piece
he
held
saying
to
him
with
a
remarkable
expression
in
his
clear
piercing
eyes
that
thou
doest
do
quickly
instantly
judas
rose
from
the
table
and
without
a
reply
or
casting
a
look
at
any
of
us
went
out
for
a
few
moments
after
his
footsteps
had
ceased
to
be
heard
there
prevailed
a
heavy
silence
in
the
chamber
for
a
strange
fear
had
fallen
upon
us
why
we
could
not
tell
and
looking
into
one
faces
and
then
into
our
dear
master
we
seemed
to
await
some
dread
event
his
face
was
placid
and
full
of
affection
as
he
looked
upon
us
the
momentary
cloud
which
shaded
the
noble
profile
when
he
spoke
to
judas
had
all
passed
off
and
there
was
the
serenity
of
a
cloudless
sky
in
his
face
what
was
the
mysterious
feast
which
he
instituted
asked
mary
interrupting
john
here
you
may
properly
call
it
mysterious
he
answered
as
we
were
eating
the
passover
jesus
took
up
bread
and
blessing
it
by
a
solemn
act
of
consecration
broke
it
with
his
hands
and
gave
a
portion
to
each
of
us
saying
with
it
eat
this
is
my
body
awed
and
impressed
by
his
manner
and
the
act
we
all
received
and
ate
it
as
he
commanded
us
to
do
as
reverently
as
if
it
were
the
holy
of
the
temple
dedicated
to
god
use
when
we
had
eaten
in
silence
what
we
perceived
was
the
inauguration
of
a
new
and
most
sacred
feast
by
his
own
hand
he
took
up
the
cup
of
wine
and
consecrated
it
also
by
giving
thanks
and
blessing
the
hallowed
cup
he
now
offered
to
each
one
of
us
we
all
drank
of
it
with
deep
devotion
for
he
said
to
us
will
drink
no
more
with
you
the
fruit
of
the
vine
until
that
day
that
i
drink
it
new
in
the
kingdom
of
god
he
also
said
of
the
wine
is
my
blood
and
how
do
you
understand
these
words
that
the
bread
consecrated
was
his
body
and
the
wine
was
his
blood
i
asked
of
the
disciple
that
is
an
inquiry
i
can
not
answer
said
john
it
is
a
mystery
but
the
lord
says
it
shall
be
made
clear
to
us
by
and
by
we
then
sang
the
passover
hymn
to
god
and
went
out
at
his
command
to
go
to
olivet
as
we
went
he
discoursed
with
us
children
he
said
am
to
be
with
you
but
a
little
while
longer
the
hour
of
my
departure
is
at
hand
remember
my
last
words
love
one
another
in
this
shall
all
men
know
that
ye
are
my
disciples
cried
peter
will
go
with
thee
thou
shalt
not
leave
us
nor
go
without
us
thus
we
all
eagerly
and
tearfully
gathered
around
him
alarmed
and
grieved
at
the
words
he
had
said
he
regarded
us
lovingly
and
said
children
i
must
leave
you
whither
i
go
you
can
not
come
thou
wentest
to
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
sea
i
will
follow
thee
my
master
and
lord
exclaimed
peter
goest
thou
that
we
may
not
follow
i
will
lay
down
my
life
for
thee
and
so
will
all
these
illustration
an
oriental
supper
scene
thou
die
for
me
peter
asked
jesus
gazing
on
him
with
a
sad
sweet
look
verily
peter
thou
little
knowest
thyself
the
cock
shall
not
crow
twice
ere
thou
shalt
thrice
deny
that
thou
knowest
me
thee
lord
repeated
peter
with
amazed
grief
and
horror
in
his
looks
peter
answered
jesus
firmly
but
kindly
that
thou
ever
knewest
me
for
the
time
draweth
near
when
there
shall
be
safety
only
in
confessing
ignorance
of
jesus
the
nazarene
and
all
ye
he
added
while
his
voice
grew
tremulous
and
tears
glistened
in
his
eyes
ye
shall
be
offended
because
of
me
this
night
ye
shall
be
ashamed
that
ye
are
my
disciples
and
ye
will
think
me
a
deceiver
and
will
be
displeased
at
me
yea
every
one
of
you
shall
desert
me
for
thus
it
is
written
the
shepherd
shall
be
smitten
and
the
sheep
shall
be
scattered
when
he
saw
that
our
hearts
were
troubled
and
that
we
were
sad
and
that
the
faithful
philip
sobbed
aloud
at
being
supposed
capable
of
abandoning
his
master
he
added
not
your
hearts
be
troubled
i
go
to
prepare
a
place
for
you
in
my
father
house
father
lord
no
longer
liveth
in
nazareth
and
were
he
alive
there
are
but
two
small
apartments
in
his
humble
house
said
thomas
sayest
thou
that
we
are
all
to
lodge
there
thou
canst
understand
only
what
thine
eyes
see
i
speak
of
my
father
who
is
in
heaven
in
his
house
are
many
mansions
jesus
then
as
we
drew
near
cedron
began
plainly
to
tell
us
that
he
was
to
die
and
that
by
his
death
we
should
be
admitted
into
a
heavenly
paradise
and
live
forever
we
could
not
understand
all
he
said
but
we
knew
that
he
was
soon
to
be
taken
from
us
and
sorrow
filled
all
our
hearts
after
discoursing
with
us
in
the
most
touching
words
he
at
length
said
let
us
go
over
cedron
to
the
side
of
olivet
into
the
garden
we
so
much
love
to
walk
in
we
went
with
him
inclosing
him
as
a
guard
to
conceal
his
person
from
the
jewish
spies
as
well
as
to
defend
him
peter
and
james
went
before
the
full
moon
shone
brightly
and
by
its
light
glancing
on
the
face
of
jesus
by
whom
i
walked
i
saw
that
it
was
sadder
than
its
wont
while
he
spoke
but
little
we
at
length
crossed
the
brook
and
entered
the
dark
groves
of
olivet
familiar
with
all
the
paths
we
advanced
to
a
central
group
of
venerable
olive
trees
beneath
which
tradition
says
abraham
used
to
sit
and
there
jesus
turning
to
us
said
in
a
voice
of
the
deepest
woe
the
hour
of
my
time
of
trial
is
come
my
work
is
ended
i
would
be
alone
remain
you
here
and
watch
for
we
shall
be
sought
for
come
with
me
peter
and
you
also
james
i
am
going
to
pray
yonder
me
also
dear
lord
i
said
sorrowfully
thou
art
always
with
me
beloved
he
answered
will
not
leave
thee
now
so
leaving
the
eight
friends
to
keep
watch
against
the
intrusion
of
his
enemies
who
were
known
to
be
everywhere
seeking
him
he
walked
away
to
the
most
secluded
recesses
of
the
garden
he
stopped
at
the
place
near
the
rock
where
adam
is
said
to
have
hidden
from
jehovah
and
saying
to
us
in
a
sorrowful
tone
ye
here
while
i
go
apart
and
pray
to
my
father
he
went
from
us
about
a
stone
cast
and
kneeled
down
where
a
thick
olive
branch
hanging
low
to
the
ground
concealed
him
from
our
view
i
was
so
solicitous
lest
he
should
leave
us
and
we
should
see
him
no
more
that
i
soon
softly
advanced
near
to
the
spot
and
beheld
him
prostrate
on
the
ground
while
deep
groans
broke
from
his
heart
i
heard
his
voice
murmuring
but
could
not
distinguish
the
words
broken
by
grief
only
the
tones
were
those
of
strange
horror
and
dread
as
he
prayed
thus
in
great
agony
i
suddenly
beheld
a
swift
light
pass
by
me
as
if
from
the
skies
and
lo
an
angel
stood
by
the
side
of
jesus
bending
over
him
and
raising
him
up
from
the
ground
a
soft
bright
glory
shone
around
the
spot
so
that
peter
seeing
it
advanced
towards
me
supposing
some
one
had
entered
the
garden
bearing
a
torch
i
beckoned
to
peter
to
be
motionless
and
he
gazed
with
me
in
speechless
astonishment
and
admiration
upon
the
form
of
the
angel
from
whose
glorious
face
was
emitted
the
radiance
which
illumined
the
place
where
jesus
was
as
the
angel
raised
jesus
from
the
ground
we
saw
that
his
divine
countenance
was
convulsed
with
anguish
and
upon
his
brow
stood
great
shining
drops
of
sweat
mingled
with
blood
which
oozed
from
his
pallid
temples
and
rolling
down
his
marble
cheeks
dropped
to
the
ground
never
had
we
beheld
a
human
visage
so
marred
by
sorrow
so
deeply
graven
with
the
lines
of
agony
the
angel
seemed
to
utter
soothing
words
and
pointed
with
his
shining
hand
towards
heaven
as
if
to
encourage
him
with
hope
and
give
him
strength
the
face
of
jesus
grew
more
serene
he
raised
his
eyes
heavenward
with
a
divine
expression
of
holy
love
and
cried
in
a
strong
voice
will
not
mine
o
god
be
done
the
angel
then
embraced
him
as
if
strengthening
him
and
soaring
upward
disappeared
like
a
star
returning
into
the
blue
depths
of
heaven
while
peter
and
i
stood
by
wondering
and
full
of
awe
at
what
we
beheld
we
remained
for
some
time
conversing
together
upon
the
wonderful
vision
we
had
seen
which
confirmed
us
in
the
certainty
that
jesus
came
from
god
and
was
in
truth
the
messias
that
should
come
but
at
length
wearied
with
our
day
excitements
we
must
have
fallen
asleep
for
we
were
suddenly
startled
by
the
voice
of
our
dear
master
saying
sleep
ye
children
but
the
hour
is
past
for
watching
ye
may
sleep
on
now
for
though
your
flesh
is
weary
your
spirit
is
willing
i
need
your
aid
no
longer
while
he
was
speaking
we
saw
many
torches
gleaming
through
the
trees
along
king
david
walk
and
the
tramp
of
feet
fell
on
our
ears
we
soon
saw
a
large
party
advancing
into
the
midst
of
the
garden
who
walked
rapidly
and
spoke
only
in
undertones
we
at
once
took
the
alarm
and
said
to
jesus
dear
master
let
us
ascend
the
hill
and
escape
by
the
way
of
bethany
for
these
are
enemies
answered
our
dear
master
must
needs
be
that
i
deliver
myself
into
the
hands
of
these
men
how
else
shall
the
scriptures
be
fulfilled
seek
safety
in
flight
for
yourselves
but
i
must
go
whither
they
will
lead
me
so
lord
answered
peter
is
time
for
thee
to
escape
or
if
not
we
will
stand
by
thee
and
defend
thee
so
said
all
the
disciples
jesus
shook
his
head
and
said
with
a
sad
smile
know
not
what
ye
say
or
would
do
mine
hour
is
come
while
he
yet
spake
the
multitude
drew
nearer
and
those
who
had
the
lead
raising
their
torches
high
above
their
heads
discovered
us
with
jesus
in
the
midst
to
my
surprise
i
beheld
judas
acting
as
their
guide
for
he
alone
knew
where
his
master
was
to
be
found
at
that
hour
upon
discovering
jesus
this
wicked
man
ran
forward
with
expressions
of
friendship
in
his
face
and
kissed
jesus
on
the
cheek
saying
master
i
am
glad
i
have
found
thee
said
jesus
thou
the
son
of
man
with
a
kiss
when
judas
heard
this
he
turned
to
the
multitude
at
the
head
of
which
i
recognized
some
of
the
chief
priests
and
of
the
most
learned
scribes
of
the
temple
and
cried
aloud
is
he
seize
him
and
hold
him
fast
thereupon
the
crowd
to
the
number
of
full
ten
score
men
among
whom
were
the
vilest
sort
of
people
rushed
forward
to
lay
hands
upon
jesus
the
moon
and
torches
together
shedding
almost
the
bright
light
of
day
into
the
garden
upon
the
whole
group
illustration
mount
of
olives
at
seeing
them
advance
so
furiously
with
spears
and
clubs
and
swords
peter
and
james
placed
themselves
before
jesus
to
defend
him
while
i
being
unarmed
cast
myself
across
his
breast
to
shield
his
heart
with
my
body
the
more
bold
men
in
the
crowd
coming
too
near
peter
smote
one
of
them
with
his
sword
as
he
was
reaching
out
his
arm
to
grasp
jesus
by
the
shoulder
and
clave
off
his
ear
at
seeing
this
the
crowd
uttered
a
fierce
shout
and
were
pressing
upon
us
when
jesus
raised
the
palm
of
his
hand
and
said
quietly
seek
ye
instantly
the
whole
mass
rolled
backward
like
a
receding
billow
rebounding
from
the
face
of
an
immovable
rock
and
every
man
thereof
fell
with
his
forehead
to
the
ground
where
they
all
lay
for
a
minute
stunned
we
twelve
alone
stood
for
judas
had
not
been
struck
down
and
now
remained
gazing
with
amazement
and
terror
upon
the
prostrate
enemies
of
jesus
cried
peter
astonished
thou
canst
thus
repel
thy
foes
thou
needest
not
fear
them
more
shall
i
smite
judas
also
put
up
thy
sword
peter
let
him
remain
to
witness
my
power
that
he
may
know
that
he
nor
his
have
any
power
over
me
save
that
i
give
them
while
he
was
thus
speaking
the
people
and
soldiers
rose
to
their
feet
and
instead
of
flying
they
seemed
to
be
infuriated
at
their
discomfiture
and
the
chief
priests
crying
out
that
it
was
by
sorcery
that
they
had
been
thus
stricken
down
they
rushed
madly
forward
and
laid
their
hands
upon
jesus
and
upon
us
all
in
vain
i
contended
against
numbers
to
rescue
jesus
overpowered
we
were
defeated
and
driven
from
the
garden
leaving
jesus
in
the
hands
of
his
enemies
when
john
had
gone
thus
far
in
his
relation
dear
father
our
tears
and
his
were
mingled
but
we
try
and
comfort
ourselves
with
the
word
of
his
promise
ye
know
not
now
but
ye
shall
know
by
and
by
and
shall
believe
truly
that
i
came
out
from
god
what
now
seems
to
you
mysterious
shall
be
made
clear
as
light
wait
and
have
faith
and
all
shall
be
made
known
which
now
you
understand
not
let
no
trials
and
degradations
ye
see
me
pass
through
cause
your
faith
to
fail
i
am
come
into
this
world
to
conquer
but
if
i
stoop
it
is
to
raise
up
the
world
with
me
when
i
rise
again
i
have
omitted
to
mention
to
you
what
more
john
related
as
wonderful
touching
the
arrest
of
the
prophet
as
the
chief
priests
bound
and
laid
their
hands
on
him
there
was
he
said
heard
in
the
air
the
sound
of
myriads
of
rushing
wings
and
notes
like
the
gathering
signal
of
a
trumpet
echoing
and
in
the
skies
as
if
a
countless
host
of
invisible
beings
were
marshaling
armies
by
armies
in
at
these
fearful
and
sublime
sounds
all
raised
their
heads
but
could
behold
nothing
then
jesus
said
with
a
majestic
and
commanding
look
such
as
i
had
never
before
beheld
upon
his
face
hear
that
i
am
not
without
heavenly
friends
i
have
only
to
pray
to
my
father
which
is
in
heaven
and
he
will
bid
twelve
legions
of
his
angels
now
hovering
in
the
air
and
yearning
to
defend
me
from
my
foes
descend
to
my
aid
but
i
desire
not
to
use
my
powers
for
myself
thus
dear
father
was
jesus
borne
away
by
a
fierce
multitude
and
dragged
into
the
city
john
whose
interest
in
and
affection
for
jesus
led
him
to
follow
them
heard
all
this
but
jesus
made
no
answer
only
walking
quietly
along
patiently
enduring
all
they
said
and
did
as
they
entered
the
city
gate
the
roman
guard
seeing
the
immense
crowd
and
uproar
stopped
them
to
learn
the
cause
of
the
commotion
have
here
a
traitor
and
conspirator
o
captain
of
the
guard
answered
eli
the
chief
priest
pestilent
fellow
who
calls
himself
christ
a
king
we
have
therefore
with
this
band
of
hired
soldiers
taken
him
as
he
was
met
secretly
with
twelve
of
his
plotting
to
overthrow
the
government
of
cæsar
and
make
himself
king
of
judea
live
cæsar
long
live
the
emperor
shouted
the
roman
soldiers
have
no
king
but
augustus
imperator
upon
this
many
of
the
soldiers
cried
him
before
the
procurator
he
will
give
him
his
deserts
who
would
take
his
procuratorship
away
from
him
to
pilate
to
pilate
annas
shouted
the
jews
to
annas
then
with
some
shouting
one
thing
and
others
another
thing
he
was
hurried
towards
the
house
of
annas
when
annas
knew
that
the
prisoner
was
jesus
he
uttered
a
fearful
oath
expressive
of
his
joy
and
wicked
satisfaction
and
hastily
robing
and
coming
down
into
the
court
he
bade
them
bring
the
prisoner
in
but
the
calm
majesty
of
jesus
abashed
him
and
checked
the
course
of
insulting
questions
he
began
putting
to
him
at
length
finding
that
the
prophet
would
make
no
reply
he
caused
him
to
be
bound
still
more
closely
with
more
cords
lest
he
should
like
samson
rend
his
bonds
and
escape
on
the
way
and
sent
him
to
caiaphas
the
high
priest
saying
to
him
will
find
voice
for
thy
tongue
o
prophet
so
thou
wouldst
destroy
the
temple
and
callest
thyself
the
son
of
the
lord
jehovah
out
blasphemer
away
with
him
or
the
house
will
be
swallowed
up
with
the
presence
of
one
so
impious
away
with
the
man
by
the
crown
of
david
pilate
will
make
thee
king
in
truth
and
give
thee
a
roman
throne
to
which
so
that
thou
mayest
not
presently
fall
from
it
he
will
nail
thee
foot
and
hand
at
this
the
cruel
crowd
shouted
their
approbation
and
many
cried
to
the
cross
to
the
cross
with
him
but
others
said
but
to
caiaphas
the
captain
of
the
roman
soldiers
resolved
that
he
should
be
taken
before
pilate
and
led
the
way
thither
jesus
bound
in
the
midst
with
renewed
uproar
they
tumultuously
pressed
forward
their
way
lighted
by
the
red
glare
of
a
hundred
torches
insulting
the
roman
soldiers
with
seditious
cries
john
followed
but
being
recognized
as
one
of
his
disciples
by
a
soldier
in
æmilius
legion
he
was
seized
and
only
escaped
by
leaving
his
apparel
in
the
grasp
of
the
rude
roman
five
of
the
disciples
who
have
escaped
arrest
are
now
in
this
house
whither
john
fled
also
on
eluding
the
grasp
of
the
soldier
leaving
his
linen
garment
in
his
hand
we
are
all
so
sad
and
anxious
to
move
in
favor
of
jesus
is
only
to
share
his
fate
and
do
him
no
service
yet
through
all
dear
father
i
do
trust
in
him
and
hope
oh
i
can
not
doubt
his
truth
and
power
i
have
seen
him
bring
lazarus
up
from
the
grave
and
i
will
not
believe
but
that
he
can
save
himself
and
will
save
himself
from
their
hands
it
is
only
when
i
shall
behold
him
really
no
more
see
him
really
dead
that
my
faith
in
his
divine
mission
will
waver
with
eyes
blinded
with
tears
i
can
scarcely
subscribe
myself
your
sad
but
loving
daughter
adina
letter
xxx
my
dear
father
i
know
not
how
to
write
i
know
not
what
to
say
dismay
and
sorrow
fill
my
heart
i
feel
as
if
life
were
a
burden
too
heavy
to
hear
they
have
crucified
him
verily
fear
and
a
snare
are
come
upon
us
desolation
and
destruction
o
my
father
we
know
not
which
way
to
turn
he
in
whom
we
trusted
has
proved
as
one
of
us
weak
and
impotent
and
has
suffered
death
without
power
to
save
himself
he
that
saved
others
could
not
escape
the
death
of
the
roman
cross
while
i
write
i
hear
the
priest
abner
in
the
court
below
mocking
my
uncle
amos
in
a
loud
voice
your
messias
is
dead
a
famous
great
prophet
surely
you
nazarenes
have
chosen
born
in
a
manger
and
crucified
as
a
thief
said
i
not
that
he
who
could
speak
against
the
temple
and
the
priesthood
was
of
beelzebub
rabbi
amos
makes
no
reply
shame
and
despair
seal
his
lips
thus
our
enemies
triumph
over
us
and
we
answer
only
with
confusion
of
face
this
unexpected
this
startling
result
has
stupefied
me
and
not
only
me
but
all
who
have
been
so
led
by
fascination
as
to
trust
in
him
even
john
the
beloved
disciple
i
hear
now
pacing
the
floor
of
the
adjoining
room
sobbing
as
if
his
noble
heart
would
burst
mary
my
cousin
sweet
voice
i
catch
from
time
to
time
trying
to
soothe
him
although
she
is
stricken
like
us
all
to
the
very
earth
the
unhappy
john
i
hear
despairingly
answer
her
do
not
try
to
comfort
me
mary
there
is
no
ground
for
hope
more
he
is
dead
dead
all
is
lost
we
who
trusted
in
him
have
only
to
fly
if
we
would
save
our
wretched
lives
into
galilee
and
return
once
more
to
our
nets
the
sun
which
shone
so
dazzlingly
has
proved
a
phantom
light
and
gone
out
in
darkness
he
whom
i
could
not
but
love
i
see
that
i
loved
too
well
since
he
proves
not
what
i
believed
him
to
be
oh
how
could
he
be
so
like
the
son
of
god
and
yet
not
be
yet
i
loved
and
adored
him
as
if
he
were
the
very
son
of
the
highest
but
i
have
seen
him
die
as
a
man
i
have
gazed
on
his
lifeless
body
i
have
beheld
the
deep
wound
made
into
his
very
heart
by
the
roman
spear
i
cast
myself
upon
him
when
he
was
taken
down
from
the
cross
and
implored
him
by
his
love
for
me
to
give
some
sign
that
he
was
not
holden
by
death
i
placed
my
trembling
hands
over
his
heart
it
was
still
still
motionless
as
stone
like
any
other
dead
man
he
was
dead
dead
with
him
die
all
our
hopes
the
hopes
of
israel
he
may
live
again
said
mary
softly
and
hesitatingly
as
if
she
herself
had
no
such
hope
he
raised
lazarus
thou
dost
remember
yes
for
jesus
was
living
to
do
it
answered
john
stopping
in
his
walk
but
how
can
the
dead
raise
the
dead
no
he
will
never
move
speak
nor
breathe
again
but
i
will
not
further
delay
the
account
of
his
trial
and
condemnation
for
you
will
be
anxious
to
know
how
such
a
man
could
be
condemned
to
a
malefactor
death
in
my
last
letter
i
spoke
of
his
arrest
through
the
traitorous
part
enacted
by
judas
led
by
his
captors
bound
by
the
wrists
with
a
cord
jesus
was
taken
from
the
dark
groves
of
olivet
where
he
had
been
found
at
prayer
and
conducted
with
great
noise
into
the
city
by
cæsar
gate
it
is
near
this
archway
that
rabbi
amos
lives
i
will
copy
for
you
my
cousin
mary
account
of
it
to
martha
of
bethany
just
written
by
her
instead
of
adding
any
more
to
my
own
i
went
out
upon
the
basilica
which
overlooked
the
streets
says
mary
and
beheld
a
multitude
advancing
with
torches
flashing
and
soon
they
came
opposite
the
house
at
least
two
hundred
men
in
number
half
clad
and
savage
looking
with
fierce
eyes
and
scowling
looks
here
and
there
among
them
was
a
levite
urging
them
on
and
i
also
beheld
abner
the
priest
firing
their
passions
by
loud
oratory
and
eager
gesticulations
behind
rode
five
roman
horsemen
with
levelled
spears
guarding
a
young
man
who
walked
with
a
firm
step
i
burst
into
tears
it
was
jesus
his
locks
were
dishevelled
his
beard
torn
his
face
marred
and
his
garments
rent
he
was
pale
and
suffering
yet
walked
with
a
firm
step
i
burst
into
tears
and
so
did
adina
who
had
come
out
to
see
what
was
passing
he
looked
up
and
said
touchingly
not
for
me
he
would
have
said
more
but
the
priest
smote
him
rudely
upon
the
mouth
and
the
crowd
following
his
example
would
have
done
him
further
insult
but
for
the
roman
soldiers
who
turned
their
spears
every
way
to
guard
him
from
violence
for
they
had
rescued
him
from
the
terrible
rage
of
the
jews
by
their
centurion
orders
and
were
commanded
to
bring
him
safely
before
pilate
so
thus
guarded
and
escorted
by
the
men
who
thirsted
for
his
blood
he
was
led
onward
to
the
pretorium
where
the
roman
procurator
resided
gradually
the
whole
multitude
disappeared
in
the
distance
when
silence
a
dread
and
unearthly
silence
succeeded
i
turned
and
looked
in
adina
face
she
was
leaning
as
colorless
as
marble
against
one
of
the
columns
of
the
basilica
can
all
this
mean
she
said
with
emotion
it
be
possible
he
has
suffered
himself
to
be
taken
he
who
could
destroy
or
make
alive
with
a
word
what
means
this
dreadful
scene
we
have
just
witnessed
i
could
not
answer
all
i
knew
was
what
my
eyes
just
beheld
that
jesus
our
prophet
our
king
our
messias
on
whom
all
our
hopes
and
the
joy
of
israel
rested
was
dragged
a
prisoner
through
the
streets
helpless
and
without
a
helper
i
trembled
with
i
knew
not
what
unknown
forebodings
suddenly
adina
cried
can
not
be
harmed
he
can
not
die
he
is
a
mighty
prophet
and
has
power
that
will
strike
his
enemies
dead
let
us
not
fear
he
has
yielded
himself
only
the
more
terribly
to
defeat
and
destroy
his
foes
we
will
not
fear
what
pilate
or
the
priests
will
do
they
can
not
harm
the
anointed
shiloh
of
the
lord
while
we
were
yet
talking
dear
martha
a
dark
figure
passed
stealthily
along
beneath
the
basilica
and
seemed
to
court
the
shadows
of
the
house
at
this
moment
my
father
rabbi
amos
opened
the
outer
gate
with
a
torch
in
his
hand
to
follow
at
our
request
the
crowd
of
people
and
see
what
should
befall
jesus
the
light
glared
full
upon
the
tall
spare
form
of
peter
the
galilean
fisherman
his
dark
stern
features
wore
an
expression
of
earnest
anxiety
it
thou
peter
exclaimed
my
father
is
all
this
who
has
ordered
the
arrest
of
jesus
what
has
he
done
hateful
and
envious
man
caiaphas
seeks
to
destroy
him
and
has
bribed
with
large
lures
of
gold
the
baser
jews
to
do
this
thing
come
with
me
rabbi
and
let
us
die
with
him
and
the
galilean
pressed
eagerly
forward
at
a
pace
with
which
my
father
could
not
keep
up
and
this
was
an
hour
ago
and
yet
no
news
has
come
from
the
pretorium
but
from
time
to
time
a
dreadful
shout
from
the
hill
on
which
the
palace
of
caiaphas
stands
breaks
upon
my
ears
and
the
glare
of
unseen
torches
illumines
the
atmosphere
high
above
the
towers
of
the
palace
it
is
a
fearful
night
of
agony
and
suspense
adina
in
her
painful
uncertainty
but
for
my
entreaties
would
go
forth
alone
towards
the
pretorium
to
hear
and
know
all
i
can
keep
myself
calm
only
by
writing
to
you
adina
has
also
commenced
a
letter
to
her
father
recording
these
sad
things
but
she
drops
her
pen
to
start
to
the
balcony
at
every
sound
when
will
this
fearful
night
end
what
will
the
morrow
reveal
it
is
an
hour
since
i
wrote
the
last
line
the
interval
has
been
one
of
agony
rumors
have
reached
us
that
the
priests
insist
on
passing
sentence
of
death
on
the
prophet
the
cries
him
crucify
him
have
distinctly
reached
our
ears
john
is
now
here
about
half
an
hour
after
jesus
passed
he
reached
our
house
nearly
destitute
of
apparel
his
clothing
having
been
torn
from
off
him
by
the
jews
in
their
efforts
to
make
him
their
prisoner
also
he
is
calm
and
confiding
saying
that
his
beloved
master
can
never
be
injured
by
them
and
that
he
will
ere
many
hours
deliver
himself
from
his
foes
and
proclaim
himself
king
of
israel
with
power
such
as
man
never
had
before
may
the
god
of
jacob
defend
him
john
has
just
gone
up
to
the
temple
to
get
news
in
disguise
of
a
priest
wearing
my
father
robes
i
have
just
seen
a
messenger
passing
in
great
haste
along
the
street
and
his
horse
falling
cast
him
almost
upon
our
threshold
it
was
the
page
of
æmilius
the
noble
roman
knight
who
is
betrothed
to
my
cousin
adina
she
hastened
to
his
aid
he
was
but
stunned
and
soon
was
able
to
say
that
he
bore
a
message
from
lucia
metella
the
fair
and
youthful
bride
of
pilate
urging
him
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
prophet
but
to
give
him
his
liberty
for
she
had
just
awakened
from
an
impressive
dream
in
which
she
saw
him
sitting
on
the
throne
of
the
universe
crowned
with
the
stars
of
heaven
the
earth
a
footstool
beneath
his
feet
and
all
nations
assembled
and
doing
him
homage
this
report
of
the
page
has
filled
our
hearts
with
joy
and
hope
inexpressible
confident
that
jesus
is
the
son
of
god
we
will
not
fear
what
man
can
do
unto
him
my
father
has
returned
it
is
day
he
says
nothing
can
save
jesus
but
his
own
divine
power
the
jews
are
in
number
many
thousands
and
cry
for
his
blood
pilate
has
but
a
cohort
of
soldiers
and
fears
to
use
force
lest
the
exasperated
people
break
into
open
revolt
and
take
the
city
from
his
hands
which
they
can
with
ease
do
if
they
will
unite
trembles
said
my
father
fear
to
condemn
the
innocent
and
dread
of
the
vengeance
of
the
jews
if
he
let
him
go
nothing
can
save
the
prophet
but
his
own
mighty
power
he
who
has
saved
others
will
surely
save
himself
while
my
father
was
speaking
a
man
rushed
into
our
presence
he
was
low
in
stature
with
a
stiff
reddish
beard
narrow
eyes
and
sharp
unpleasant
visage
his
attire
was
ragged
and
mean
as
was
his
whole
aspect
he
grasped
in
his
right
hand
a
small
bag
which
rung
with
coin
as
his
shaking
fingers
held
it
he
trembled
all
over
and
seizing
my
father
by
the
arm
with
the
quick
nervous
grasp
of
a
lunatic
cried
hoarsely
he
let
them
will
he
will
he
he
what
iscariot
of
whom
do
you
speak
art
thou
crazed
thou
shouldst
well
be
after
thy
deed
he
let
them
kill
him
will
he
die
will
he
die
think
you
he
will
escape
he
can
if
he
will
cords
to
him
are
ropes
of
sand
no
he
is
bound
hand
and
foot
answered
my
father
sadly
makes
no
defense
i
fear
he
will
let
them
do
as
they
will
with
him
he
makes
no
effort
to
save
his
life
at
this
judas
for
it
was
that
wicked
man
beat
his
knitted
forehead
in
a
frenzied
manner
with
the
bag
of
silver
and
with
a
look
of
horrible
despair
rushed
forth
crying
as
he
went
will
save
him
the
priests
shall
have
their
money
again
he
shall
not
die
if
i
had
believed
he
would
not
do
some
miracle
to
escape
them
i
never
would
have
sold
him
i
hoped
to
get
their
money
and
trusted
if
they
bound
him
for
him
to
escape
by
his
own
power
i
did
not
dream
that
he
would
not
exert
it
to
save
himself
i
will
save
thee
innocent
man
of
god
for
i
not
thou
alone
am
guilty
oh
if
i
had
suspected
this
but
he
shall
not
die
with
these
ravings
he
disappeared
towards
the
pretorium
leaving
us
all
amazed
at
what
we
had
heard
the
sun
is
up
the
fate
of
jesus
is
sealed
the
procurator
has
signed
the
sentence
of
death
and
he
is
to
be
crucified
but
with
judas
i
believe
that
he
can
not
die
and
that
he
will
signalize
the
hour
by
some
wonderful
miracle
of
personal
deliverance
thus
tremblingly
we
hope
and
wait
here
terminates
my
dear
father
what
my
cousin
has
written
to
martha
and
lazarus
your
sorrowing
but
loving
daughter
adina
letter
xxxi
dearest
father
i
have
only
terminated
my
last
letter
to
take
up
my
pen
for
the
beginning
of
another
for
i
find
relief
only
in
writing
to
you
from
the
deep
affliction
which
has
struck
me
to
the
earth
if
anything
can
add
to
my
mortification
at
the
death
of
the
nazarene
jesus
it
is
that
i
shall
have
endeavored
so
earnestly
to
make
you
believe
in
him
also
oh
i
shall
never
have
confidence
in
a
human
being
again
and
the
more
lovely
the
more
holy
the
more
heavenly
the
character
of
any
one
the
wiser
and
purer
their
teachings
the
more
distrustful
shall
i
be
of
them
but
i
will
turn
from
these
painful
thoughts
and
as
i
promised
in
my
last
will
give
you
an
account
of
what
passed
at
his
trial
it
is
now
the
morning
following
the
crucifixion
and
i
am
calmer
than
i
was
yesterday
and
will
be
able
to
write
with
more
coherency
hours
have
passed
since
he
was
nailed
to
the
cross
his
followers
have
been
since
his
arrest
hunted
like
wild
beasts
of
the
wilderness
annas
has
hired
and
filled
with
wine
fierce
roman
soldiers
and
sent
them
everywhere
to
seize
the
fugitive
nazarenes
john
was
especially
sought
out
and
the
emissaries
of
annas
came
at
midnight
last
night
to
the
house
to
take
him
but
we
assisted
him
in
making
his
escape
by
means
of
the
subterranean
passage
that
leads
from
the
dwelling
of
rabbi
amos
to
the
catacombs
beneath
the
temple
æmilius
though
only
recently
a
convert
from
the
paganism
of
rome
is
firm
in
his
faith
that
jesus
will
rise
again
to
life
and
instead
of
giving
up
all
as
we
do
he
says
that
he
should
not
be
amazed
to
be
suddenly
told
by
the
soldiers
whom
he
left
to
guard
his
tomb
that
he
had
burst
forth
alive
from
the
dead
but
i
have
forgotten
that
i
am
to
narrate
to
you
dear
father
the
particulars
of
his
accusation
trial
and
condemnation
as
i
was
not
present
in
the
pretorium
i
am
indebted
for
the
further
details
which
i
shall
give
in
part
to
john
and
in
part
to
rabbi
amos
as
soon
as
the
mob
of
jews
who
had
jesus
under
arrest
and
which
i
saw
pass
the
house
reached
the
abode
of
rabbi
annas
he
asked
them
whom
they
had
in
custody
and
when
they
answered
that
it
was
the
great
nazarene
prophet
he
said
with
joy
him
into
the
lower
court
that
i
may
see
him
by
the
rod
of
aaron
i
would
have
him
do
some
notable
miracle
for
me
and
thus
speaking
the
old
man
hastened
down
to
the
court
which
on
reaching
he
found
thronged
with
the
infuriated
multitude
it
was
with
difficulty
he
made
a
passage
to
where
jesus
stood
both
imprisoned
and
defended
by
a
glittering
lattice
of
roman
spears
after
regarding
him
attentively
he
said
with
curiosity
yet
with
sarcasm
thou
then
the
king
of
the
jews
hast
thou
come
to
reign
on
the
throne
of
david
show
me
a
sign
from
heaven
and
i
will
acknowledge
thee
o
nazarene
but
jesus
stood
calm
and
dignified
making
no
answer
annas
then
angrily
plucked
him
by
the
beard
and
a
messenger
at
the
same
moment
arrived
to
say
to
him
that
caiaphas
the
high
priest
demanded
to
have
jesus
brought
before
him
upon
this
he
said
in
a
loud
voice
him
to
the
palace
caiaphas
my
would
see
the
man
who
would
destroy
the
temple
and
rebuild
it
in
three
days
there
now
arose
a
dreadful
shout
from
the
priests
and
people
who
rushing
upon
jesus
cried
him
and
attempted
to
grasp
his
person
as
they
guarded
him
along
the
streets
but
in
protecting
him
as
they
had
been
commanded
to
do
the
romans
wounded
several
of
the
jews
hereupon
there
was
a
great
cry
of
sedition
and
shouts
of
with
the
roman
eagles
down
with
the
barbarians
death
to
the
gentiles
these
cries
were
followed
up
by
a
fearful
rush
of
the
mass
of
men
upon
the
handful
of
guards
they
were
forced
back
their
spears
broken
like
straws
or
turned
aside
and
jesus
successfully
wrested
from
their
power
but
in
the
height
of
the
battle
æmilius
appeared
with
a
portion
of
the
legion
of
which
he
was
prefect
and
instantly
charging
the
people
who
fled
before
the
breasts
of
his
horses
rescued
the
prophet
said
æmilius
to
the
prophet
with
compassionate
respect
know
thou
hast
power
from
god
to
disperse
as
chaff
this
rabble
of
fiends
speak
and
let
them
perish
at
thy
divine
command
my
son
i
am
come
into
the
world
for
this
hour
answered
jesus
also
is
a
part
of
my
mission
from
my
father
it
becomes
me
to
endure
all
things
even
death
can
not
die
my
lord
said
æmilius
warmly
i
not
see
thee
raise
lazarus
from
the
tomb
die
i
came
into
this
world
but
not
for
myself
i
lay
down
my
life
and
i
can
take
it
again
these
men
could
have
no
power
over
me
except
my
father
did
grant
it
to
them
and
what
my
father
willeth
i
will
also
seek
not
my
son
to
deliver
me
these
words
passed
between
them
beneath
the
portico
as
æmilius
was
loosing
the
sharp
cords
from
the
bleeding
wrists
of
the
youthful
prophet
caiaphas
to
caiaphas
now
cried
the
multitude
who
had
been
for
a
moment
awed
by
the
bold
charge
of
the
roman
horse
but
now
grew
bolder
as
some
men
removed
the
dead
and
wounded
out
of
sight
the
palace
with
the
blasphemer
for
he
who
calls
himself
god
is
by
our
law
to
be
punished
with
death
to
the
high
priest
with
him
can
rescue
you
great
prophet
said
æmilius
resolutely
me
the
word
and
you
are
mounted
on
my
horse
and
safe
in
the
castle
of
david
high
priest
has
sent
for
me
he
must
be
obeyed
answered
jesus
and
æmilius
surprised
at
his
refusal
to
escape
reluctantly
escorted
him
to
the
palace
the
windows
already
glared
with
torches
and
the
superb
hall
of
aaron
was
alight
with
a
hundred
flambeaux
caiaphas
was
already
upon
his
throne
although
it
was
long
past
the
hour
of
midnight
an
unwonted
time
for
him
to
sit
in
the
council
chamber
but
his
desire
to
have
jesus
brought
before
him
led
him
to
hold
an
extraordinary
court
a
score
of
the
elders
and
chief
priests
were
standing
about
him
their
dark
eager
faces
earnestly
watching
the
entrance
to
get
a
look
at
the
approaching
prophet
as
jesus
serenely
entered
led
by
the
sorrowful
æmilius
caiaphas
bent
his
tall
gaunt
form
forward
thrust
his
neck
and
huge
head
in
advance
and
with
keen
eyes
and
sharp
scrutinizing
glances
surveyed
him
whom
he
jealously
looked
upon
as
his
foe
the
multitude
pressing
in
soon
filled
the
vast
hall
and
even
crowded
upon
the
rostrum
upon
which
were
seated
the
scribes
elders
and
many
of
the
principal
priests
the
roman
soldiers
with
clanging
steel
marched
in
and
arrayed
themselves
on
either
side
of
the
high
throne
leaving
jesus
standing
alone
before
its
footstool
contrasting
with
the
brilliancy
of
the
gorgeous
hall
and
the
glittering
robes
of
the
priests
surged
and
heaved
and
moved
below
the
dark
masses
of
the
people
in
their
gray
and
brown
caps
and
cloaks
for
the
night
was
cold
and
they
wore
their
winter
garments
and
all
this
wild
ocean
of
human
forms
gleamed
with
ten
thousand
eyes
flashing
like
the
phosphorescent
stars
that
glitter
on
the
surface
of
the
upheaving
sea
when
the
shadow
of
the
hangs
above
it
and
the
winds
are
about
to
be
unbound
to
lash
it
into
fury
so
seemed
this
terrible
sea
of
human
heads
jesus
the
center
of
their
looks
and
of
their
hate
he
alone
of
all
that
countless
host
he
alone
was
calm
serene
fearless
caiaphas
now
waved
his
hand
with
a
gesture
for
silence
and
addressed
jesus
then
he
spoke
with
haughty
irony
art
jesus
the
galilean
prophet
men
say
thou
canst
raise
the
dead
we
would
fain
behold
a
miracle
thinkest
thou
if
we
put
thee
to
death
presently
thou
canst
raise
thyself
saith
rabbi
amos
who
stood
near
him
and
saw
all
remained
unmoved
his
bearing
was
marked
by
a
certain
divine
dignity
while
an
expression
of
holy
resignation
sat
upon
his
features
he
looked
like
peace
incarnate
in
the
form
of
man
a
soft
influence
seemed
to
flow
from
his
presence
producing
a
universal
but
momentary
emotion
of
sympathy
caiaphas
perceived
it
and
cried
in
his
harsh
stern
voice
have
brought
this
man
before
me
men
of
jerusalem
of
what
do
you
accuse
him
let
those
who
have
accusations
come
forward
and
make
them
he
is
a
jew
and
shall
have
justice
by
our
laws
jews
have
no
power
to
try
a
man
for
his
life
most
noble
caiaphas
said
æmilius
lives
of
all
your
nation
are
in
the
hand
of
cæsar
and
of
his
tribunals
you
can
put
no
man
to
death
æmilius
had
spoken
in
hopes
that
if
jesus
could
be
brought
before
pilate
the
procurator
he
might
be
by
him
released
for
he
knew
pilate
had
no
envy
or
feeling
against
the
prophet
sayest
well
noble
roman
answered
caiaphas
for
the
crime
of
blasphemy
against
the
temple
we
are
permitted
by
cæsar
to
judge
our
people
by
the
laws
of
moses
and
this
man
if
rumor
comes
nigh
the
truth
has
been
guilty
of
blasphemy
but
we
will
hear
the
witnesses
hereupon
several
of
the
chief
priests
and
scribes
who
had
been
going
in
and
out
among
the
crowd
brought
forward
certain
men
whose
very
aspect
showed
them
to
be
of
the
baser
sort
one
of
these
men
testified
that
he
had
heard
jesus
say
that
he
would
destroy
the
temple
and
could
again
in
three
days
rebuild
it
more
magnificently
than
it
was
in
the
days
of
solomon
the
mighty
upon
this
testimony
all
the
priests
shouted
and
called
for
jesus
to
be
stoned
to
death
a
second
witness
was
now
produced
by
abijah
the
most
passionate
of
the
scribes
who
testified
that
jesus
had
taught
in
samaria
that
men
would
soon
no
longer
worship
in
the
temple
but
that
the
whole
earth
would
be
a
temple
for
jews
and
gentiles
this
was
no
sooner
heard
than
some
of
the
men
gnashed
at
jesus
with
their
teeth
and
but
for
the
gestures
and
loud
voice
of
the
high
priest
they
would
have
made
an
attempt
to
get
him
into
their
power
a
third
witness
a
man
who
had
been
notorious
for
his
crimes
now
came
up
he
carried
on
his
wrist
a
cock
with
steel
gaffs
upon
the
spurs
as
if
he
had
just
been
brought
up
from
the
to
bear
testimony
for
such
were
the
sort
of
fellows
suborned
by
the
priests
he
testified
that
jesus
said
that
the
day
would
soon
come
when
not
one
stone
should
be
left
upon
another
of
the
temple
that
he
had
called
it
den
of
thieves
the
priests
guides
and
the
scribes
and
the
pharisees
but
the
fourth
and
fifth
witnesses
contradicted
each
other
as
also
did
others
such
opposite
testimony
perplexed
and
irritated
caiaphas
and
confounded
the
chief
priests
and
scribes
the
high
priest
now
began
to
perceive
that
jesus
would
have
to
be
released
for
want
of
testimony
against
him
galilean
and
blasphemer
of
god
and
his
temple
answerest
thou
nothing
cried
the
high
priest
thou
not
what
these
witness
against
thee
but
jesus
remained
silent
caiaphas
was
about
to
break
the
silence
by
some
fierce
words
when
a
voice
was
overheard
the
other
side
of
the
columns
on
the
left
of
the
throne
where
was
a
fireplace
in
which
was
burning
a
large
fire
about
which
stood
many
persons
rabbi
amos
at
once
recognized
in
the
violent
speaker
peter
who
had
come
in
with
him
and
john
the
latter
of
whom
in
the
disguise
of
a
priest
stood
not
far
from
jesus
gazing
tenderly
upon
him
and
listening
with
the
most
painful
interest
to
all
that
they
testified
against
him
but
peter
stood
farther
off
by
the
fire
yet
not
less
eagerly
attending
to
all
that
passed
art
one
of
the
nazarene
followers
cried
the
voice
of
a
maid
who
brought
wood
to
feed
the
fire
needest
not
to
deny
it
i
am
of
galilee
and
knew
thee
when
thou
wert
a
fisherman
seize
him
for
he
is
one
of
them
i
swear
by
the
altar
and
ark
of
god
and
by
the
sacred
tables
i
know
not
the
fellow
i
never
saw
galilee
speech
betrayeth
thee
now
thou
hast
spoken
cried
the
woman
art
a
galilean
and
thy
name
is
simon
i
know
thee
well
and
how
three
years
ago
you
and
your
brother
andrew
left
your
nets
to
follow
this
nazarene
the
thunders
of
horeb
and
the
curse
of
jehovah
follow
me
if
what
thou
sayest
be
true
woman
thou
mistakest
me
for
some
other
man
i
swear
to
you
by
the
head
of
my
father
men
and
brethren
that
i
never
saw
his
face
before
i
know
not
the
man
as
he
spoke
said
john
he
cast
his
angry
looks
towards
the
place
where
jesus
stood
he
caught
his
master
eyes
bent
upon
him
with
a
tender
and
reproving
gaze
so
full
of
sorrowing
compassion
mingled
with
forgiveness
that
i
saw
peter
start
as
if
smitten
with
lightning
he
then
pressed
his
two
hands
to
his
face
and
uttering
a
cry
of
anguish
and
despair
that
made
the
high
priest
look
and
which
went
to
every
heart
he
rushed
out
by
the
open
door
into
the
darkness
and
disappeared
as
he
did
so
the
cock
which
was
held
tied
upon
the
wrist
of
the
third
witness
crowed
twice
in
a
loud
tone
i
then
remembered
the
words
of
jesus
to
peter
spoken
but
twelve
hours
before
night
even
before
the
cock
crow
the
first
watch
of
the
morning
thou
shalt
thrice
deny
that
thou
knowest
me
upon
this
added
john
my
confidence
in
my
master
came
back
full
and
strong
and
i
felt
that
he
would
not
could
not
be
harmed
for
he
foreknew
all
things
that
could
happen
to
him
and
would
yet
escape
death
at
length
after
great
excitement
and
dissension
among
the
elders
chief
priests
and
scribes
caiaphas
placed
jesus
before
their
great
council
at
their
demand
their
hall
adjoined
his
own
here
they
as
well
as
caiaphas
questioned
him
closely
and
said
thou
the
christ
the
son
of
the
blessed
i
adjure
thee
by
the
living
god
tell
us
plainly
jesus
then
elevated
his
princely
form
and
bending
his
eyes
upon
the
face
of
the
high
priest
with
a
look
so
brightly
celestial
that
caiaphas
involuntarily
dropped
his
eyelids
to
the
ground
answered
and
said
have
said
that
which
i
am
the
expression
of
his
countenance
says
john
seemed
to
shine
as
he
had
seen
it
in
the
mount
when
he
was
transfigured
before
him
of
israel
and
judah
ye
hear
his
words
cried
the
high
priest
rending
down
the
blue
lace
from
his
ephod
ye
his
blasphemy
what
think
ye
need
we
any
further
witness
than
his
own
mouth
is
guilty
of
death
cried
abner
in
a
hoarse
voice
his
eyes
red
with
being
up
all
the
night
glaring
like
a
leopard
and
advancing
to
where
jesus
stood
bound
and
bleeding
he
spat
in
his
face
thrice
this
was
followed
by
a
loud
outcry
for
his
death
and
several
vile
fellows
also
spat
upon
him
and
pulled
him
by
the
beard
this
jewish
justice
cried
æmilius
indignantly
to
caiaphas
you
condemn
and
kill
a
man
without
witness
stand
back
for
romans
are
not
used
to
see
men
condemned
without
law
back
fellows
or
your
blood
will
flow
sooner
than
his
for
which
you
thirst
at
this
determined
attitude
they
gave
back
for
a
moment
and
left
jesus
standing
in
the
midst
sad
but
serene
john
ran
to
him
and
wiped
the
blood
and
uncleanness
from
his
lips
and
cheeks
and
beard
and
gave
him
water
which
the
woman
who
had
recognized
peter
compassionately
brought
in
a
ewer
use
thy
power
and
escape
from
them
whispered
john
tempt
me
not
beloved
he
answered
power
is
not
for
my
deliverance
but
for
that
of
the
world
for
you
i
can
do
mighty
works
but
for
myself
i
do
nothing
i
came
not
to
save
my
life
but
to
lay
it
down
mine
hour
is
at
hand
not
a
handful
of
romans
frighten
you
men
of
jerusalem
cried
abner
is
not
a
legion
in
all
the
city
here
we
are
masters
if
we
will
it
to
the
rescue
let
me
hear
the
lion
of
judah
roar
in
his
might
and
the
eagle
of
rome
will
shriek
and
fly
away
to
the
rescue
men
and
brethren
cried
caiaphas
who
had
judgment
enough
to
see
that
the
first
blow
would
be
the
beginning
of
a
revolution
that
would
bring
down
upon
the
city
the
roman
army
quartered
in
syria
and
end
in
the
destruction
of
the
nation
madmen
but
his
voice
was
drowned
amid
the
roar
of
the
human
tempest
æmilius
and
his
men
were
borne
away
on
the
crest
of
the
surge
and
so
pressed
by
the
bodies
of
the
jews
that
they
could
not
make
use
of
their
weapons
in
the
wild
confusion
jesus
was
carried
by
fierce
hands
to
the
opposite
end
of
the
council
chamber
while
caiaphas
strove
to
appease
the
wrath
of
æmilius
who
insisted
that
the
fate
of
jesus
should
be
left
with
pilate
the
procurator
when
æmilius
aided
by
the
authority
of
caiaphas
at
length
came
where
jesus
had
been
dragged
they
found
him
standing
blindfolded
among
a
crowd
of
the
basest
fellows
of
jerusalem
who
were
diverting
themselves
by
slapping
his
cheeks
and
asking
him
to
tell
by
his
divine
knowledge
of
all
things
who
did
it
they
would
also
hold
money
before
his
blinded
eyes
and
ask
him
to
name
its
value
or
inscription
and
when
he
still
kept
silence
they
struck
him
will
let
thee
go
nazarene
said
one
thou
wilt
tell
how
many
hairs
i
have
in
my
beard
let
him
divine
cried
another
i
gave
for
my
passover
lamb
in
the
market
and
the
name
of
the
samaritan
of
whom
i
bought
it
with
your
lambs
kish
shouted
a
third
fellow
thrusting
himself
forward
me
hear
him
prophesy
what
galilean
silent
and
sullen
i
will
make
thee
speak
and
he
let
a
blow
of
his
staff
fall
upon
the
head
of
jesus
which
would
have
struck
him
to
the
earth
but
for
the
voice
of
caiaphas
which
had
arrested
in
part
its
force
of
israel
he
cried
aloud
this
pestilent
nazarene
is
a
blasphemer
we
have
heard
with
our
ears
and
by
our
law
he
ought
to
die
because
he
hath
made
himself
the
son
of
god
but
cæsar
hath
taken
the
power
of
life
and
death
out
of
our
hands
we
jews
can
put
no
man
to
death
but
the
romans
only
that
he
hath
spoken
against
cæsar
and
is
a
seditionist
can
be
proved
let
us
take
him
before
pilate
with
this
accusation
this
speech
pleased
the
people
and
having
rebound
jesus
more
securely
they
cried
all
with
one
voice
pilate
to
the
pretorium
the
multitude
then
poured
out
of
the
gates
of
the
palace
like
a
foaming
and
chafing
river
which
hath
overflowed
its
banks
and
with
terrible
cries
which
we
heard
even
in
our
house
took
the
direction
towards
the
pretorium
it
was
with
difficulty
that
æmilius
could

the
prophet
in
safety
up
the
hill
and
to
the
entrance
of
the
pretorium
which
he
entered
with
his
prisoner
just
as
the
sun
gilded
the
loftiest
pinnacles
of
the
temple

dear
father
i
will
continue
the
account
of
his
trial
the
remembrance
of
which
while
i
now
write
of
it
almost
rekindles
again
all
my
love
faith
devotion
and
confidence

borne
so
meekly
all
this

adina
letter
xxxii
my
dear
father
this
is
the
evening
of
the
great
day
of
the
feast
and
the
second
day
since
the
ignominious
execution
of
him
whom
we
all
believed
to
have
been
the
christ
the
son
of
the
blessed
yet
he
still
lies
dead
in
the
tomb
alas
that
one
so
good
and
noble
and
wise
should
have
been
a
deceiver
henceforth
i
have
no
faith
in
goodness
i
have
wept
till
i
can
weep
no
more
it
is
now
the
close
of
the
high
day
of
the
feast
the
slanting
rays
of
the
setting
sun
linger
yet
upon
the
gilded
lances
that
terminate
the
lesser
pinnacles
of
the
holy
house
of
the
lord
the
smoke
of
incense
curls
lazily
up
from
the
sky
from
its
unseen
altar
and
the
deep
voices
of
the
choir
of
levites
increased
by
those
of
the
tens
of
thousands
of
judah
who
crowd
all
the
courts
of
the
temple
fall
upon
my
ears
like
muffled
thunder
i
never
heard
anything
so
solemn
above
the
temple
has
hung
since
the
crucifixion
yesterday
the
cloud
of
the
smoke
of
the
sacrifices
and
it
immovably
depends
over
all
the
city
like
a
pall
the
sun
does
not
penetrate
it
though
its
light
falls
upon
the
earth
outside
of
the
city
but
all
jerusalem
remains
in
shadow
this
cloud
is
a
fearful
sight
and
all
men
have
been
watching
it
and
talking
of
it
and
wondering
it
seems
to
be
in
the
form
of
black
gigantic
wings
spreading
a
league
broad
over
jerusalem
there
it
now
hangs
visible
from
my
window
but
we
are
in
some
sort
used
to
its
dreadful
presence
and
cease
to
fear
but
we
are
lost
in
wonder
this
morning
when
a
high
wind
arose
blowing
from
the
great
sea
eastward
every
one
expected
and
hoped
to
see
the
cloud
sail
away
before
it
in
the
direction
of
the
desert
but
the
only
effect
the
wind
produced
was
to
agitate
its
whole
surface
in
tumultuous
billows
while
the
mass
still
retained
its
position
above
the
city
the
shadow
it
casts
is
supernatural
and
fearful
like
the
dread
obscurity
which
marks
an
eclipse
of
the
sun
and
this
reminds
me
my
dear
father
to
mention
what
in
the
multiplicity
of
subjects
that
rush
to
my
pen
for
expression
i
have
omitted
to
state
to
you
and
what
is
unaccountable
unless
men
have
in
truth
crucified
in
jesus
the
very
son
of
god
at
the
time
of
his
death
the
sun
disappeared
from
the
and
darkness
like
that
of
night
followed
over
all
the
earth
so
that
the
stars
became
visible
and
the
hills
on
which
jerusalem
stands
shook
as
if
an
earthquake
had
moved
them
and
many
houses
were
thrown
down
and
where
the
dead
are
buried
outside
of
the
city
the
earth
and
rocks
were
rent
tombs
broken
up
and
many
bodies
of
the
dead
were
heaved
to
the
surface
and
exposed
to
all
eyes
these
bodies
have
lain
all
for
the
jews
dare
not
touch
them
to
them
for
fear
of
being
defiled
all
this
is
fearful
and
unaccountable
it
is
known
too
that
as
jesus
expired
the
vail
of
the
temple
was
rent
in
twain
and
exposed
the
holy
of
holies
to
every
common
gaze
what
will
be
the
end
of
these
things
is
known
only
to
the
god
of
abraham
never
was
so
fearful
a
passover
before
faces
are
pale
and
all
look
as
though
some
dread
calamity
had
befallen
the
nation
my
last
letter
my
dear
father
closed
with
the
termination
of
the
examination
of
jesus
before
caiaphas
guarded
by
æmilius
who
was
his
true
friend
to
the
last
he
was
led
to
the
house
of
pilate
the
pretorian
gates
were
shut
by
the
roman
guards
as
the
tumultuous
crowd
advanced
for
pilate
believed
the
jews
were
in
insurrection
and
was
prepared
to
defend
his
palace
for
so
few
are
the
troops
with
him
in
the
city
that
he
has
for
some
weeks
held
only
the
name
of
power
rather
than
the
reality
but
when
æmilius
explained
to
the
captain
of
the
guard
that
the
jews
desired
to
accuse
jesus
the
nazarene
of
sedition
before
the
procurator
he
was
admitted
with
the
chief
men
of
the
city
into
the
outer
court
of
antiochus
and
at
their
call
pilate
came
forth
to
them
when
he
saw
the
vast
concourse
of
people
with
caiaphas
and
the
chief
priests
and
many
rich
sadducees
with
the
leading
men
of
jerusalem
in
the
advance
and
jesus
bound
and
disfigured
by
the
insults
he
had
undergone
and
æmilius
and
his
few
soldiers
enclosing
him
with
their
protecting
spears
and
heard
the
loud
voices
of
the
multitude
as
of
wolves
baying
for
the
blood
of
a
defenceless
lamb
he
stood
with
amazement
for
a
few
moments
surveying
the
scene
what
means
this
æmilius
he
demanded
of
the
young
prefect
who
is
this
captive
it
is
jesus
called
the
christ
my
lord
the
prophet
of
galilee
the
jews
desire
his
death
accusing
him
of
blaspheming
their
god
and
but
i
have
no
concern
with
their
religion
or
the
worship
of
their
god
let
them
judge
him
after
their
own
way
said
pilate
indifferently
and
with
an
indolent
air
but
most
noble
roman
said
caiaphas
advancing
to
the
portico
on
which
the
procurator
stood
by
our
law
he
should
suffer
death
and
thou
knowest
though
we
can
condemn
as
we
now
have
done
this
galilean
we
have
no
power
to
execute
sentence
of
death
this
is
well
said
but
would
you
have
me
put
one
of
your
nation
to
death
for
blaspheming
your
god
so
far
as
that
is
concerned
o
priest
added
pilate
smiling
contemptuously
we
romans
blaspheme
him
daily
for
we
worship
him
not
and
will
have
naught
to
do
with
your
faith
let
the
man
go
i
see
no
cause
of
death
in
him
he
then
spoke
to
æmilius
and
desired
him
to
lead
jesus
to
the
spot
where
he
stood
pilate
regarded
him
with
mingled
pity
and
interest
after
surveying
him
a
moment
he
turned
to
one
of
his
officers
and
said
aside
a
form
divine
and
fit
for
apollo
or
any
of
the
greater
gods
his
bearing
is
like
a
hero
mehercule
the
chisel
of
praxiteles
nor
of
phidias
traced
the
outlines
of
limbs
and
neck
like
these
he
is
the
very
incarnation
of
human
symmetry
and
dignity
the
courtiers
nodded
assent
to
these
cool
criticisms
of
the
indolent
and
voluptuous
italian
jesus
in
the
meanwhile
stood
motionless
before
his
judge
his
eyes
downcast
and
full
of
a
holy
sadness
and
his
lips
compressed
with
immovable
patience
pilate
now
turned
to
him
and
said
thou
art
then
that
jesus
of
whom
men
talk
so
widely
men
say
o
jesus
that
thou
art
wiser
than
ordinary
men
that
thou
canst
do
works
of
necromancy
and
art
skilled
in
the
subtle
mysteries
of
astrology
i
would
question
thee
upon
these
things
wilt
thou
read
my
destiny
for
me
in
the
stars
if
thou
answerest
well
i
will
befriend
thee
and
deliver
thee
from
thy
countrymen
who
seem
to
howl
for
thy
blood
my
lord
cried
caiaphas
furiously
thou
must
not
let
this
man
go
he
is
a
deceiver
and
traitor
to
cæsar
i
charge
him
and
formally
accuse
him
before
thy
tribunal
with
making
himself
king
of
judea
to
this
the
whole
multitude
assented
in
one
deep
voice
of
rage
and
fierce
denunciation
that
shook
the
very
walls
of
the
pretorium
what
sayest
thou
demanded
pilate
art
thou
a
king
methinks
if
thou
wert
such
these
jews
have
little
need
to
fear
thee
and
the
roman
cast
a
careless
glance
over
the
mean
and
torn
apparel
and
limbs
of
the
prophet
before
jesus
could
reply
which
he
seemed
about
to
do
there
was
heard
a
sudden
commotion
in
the
lower
part
of
the
court
of
gabbatha
and
a
loud
hoarse
voice
was
heard
crying
make
way
give
back
he
is
innocent
all
eyes
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
archway
when
a
man
was
seen
forcing
his
path
towards
the
door
of
the
judgment
hall
in
front
of
which
pilate
was
standing
with
jesus
a
step
or
two
below
what
means
this
madman
cried
the
procurator
some
of
you
arrest
him
i
am
not
mad
he
is
innocent
i
have
betrayed
the
innocent
blood
cried
iscariot
for
it
was
he
leaping
into
the
space
in
front
of
the
portico
take
back
thy
money
and
let
this
holy
prophet
of
god
go
free
i
swear
to
you
by
the
altar
he
is
innocent
and
if
thou
harm
him
thou
wilt
be
accursed
with
the
vengeance
of
jehovah
take
back
thy
silver
for
he
is
innocent
what
is
that
to
us
see
thou
to
that
answered
abner
the
priest
haughtily
while
the
eyes
of
caiaphas
falling
under
the
withering
glance
of
the
roman
procurator
betrayed
his
guilt
wilt
thou
not
release
him
if
i
give
thee
back
the
pieces
cried
judas
in
accents
of
despair
taking
caiaphas
by
the
mantle
and
then
kneeling
to
him
imploringly
but
caiaphas
angrily
shook
him
off
at
last
in
a
frenzied
manner
he
threw
himself
at
the
knees
of
jesus
and
cried
in
the
most
thrilling
accents
oh
master
master
thou
hast
the
power
release
thyself
no
judas
answered
the
prophet
shaking
his
head
and
gazing
down
compassionately
upon
his
betrayer
and
without
one
look
of
resentment
at
his
having
betrayed
him
mine
hour
is
come
for
this
hour
i
came
into
the
world
i
believed
surely
thou
wouldst
not
suffer
thyself
to
be
arrested
it
is
my
avarice
that
hath
slain
thee
oh
god
oh
god
i
see
now
it
is
too
late
thus
crying
in
a
voice
of
despair
he
arose
and
rushed
with
his
face
hid
in
his
cloak
forth
from
the
presence
of
all
towards
the
outer
gate
this
extraordinary
interruption
produced
a
startling
effect
upon
all
present
and
a
few
moments
elapsed
before
pilate
could
resume
his
examination
of
jesus
which
he
did
by
entering
the
judgment
hall
and
taking
his
seat
on
the
throne
he
then
repeated
his
question
but
with
more
deference
than
before
art
thou
a
king
then
thou
sayest
that
which
i
am
a
king
jesus
answered
with
a
dignity
truly
regal
in
its
bearing
for
all
the
time
bound
and
marred
as
he
was
by
the
hands
of
his
enemies
pale
with
suffering
and
with
standing
a
sleepless
and
fearful
night
upon
his
feet
exposed
to
cold
and
to
insults
yet
he
had
a
kingly
air
and
there
seemed
to
float
about
his
head
a
divine
glory
as
if
a
sunbeam
had
been
shining
down
upon
him
thou
thyself
hearest
him
exclaimed
caiaphas
standing
upon
the
threshold
of
the
judgment
hall
of
the
gentile
governor
which
he
would
not
enter
for
fear
of
defilement
he
has
everywhere
publicly
proclaimed
that
he
has
been
ordained
of
god
to
the
kingdom
of
judah
and
overthrow
the
power
of
cæsar
in
jerusalem
added
the
governor
of
the
temple
lifting
his
voice
so
as
to
be
heard
above
the
voices
of
the
priests
and
scribes
who
all
speaking
together
vehemently
accused
him
of
many
other
things
pilate
at
length
obtained
comparative
silence
and
then
said
to
jesus
hearest
thou
these
accusations
hast
thou
no
answer
to
make
behold
how
many
things
they
witness
against
thee
pilate
spoke
as
if
he
had
taken
a
deep
interest
in
jesus
and
would
give
him
an
opportunity
of
defending
himself
he
hath
perverted
the
nation
a
most
pestilent
and
dangerous
fellow
exclaimed
caiaphas
he
is
a
blasphemer
above
all
men
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
your
religion
if
he
hath
blasphemed
your
gods
take
ye
him
and
judge
him
according
to
your
laws
answered
pilate
thou
knowest
o
noble
roman
that
we
have
no
power
to
execute
to
the
death
therefore
do
we
accuse
him
before
thee
i
am
no
jew
priest
what
care
i
for
your
domestic
and
religious
quarrels
he
hath
done
nothing
that
i
can
learn
for
which
the
laws
of
imperial
rome
which
now
prevail
here
can
adjudge
him
to
death
i
therefore
command
his
release
upon
this
the
jews
sent
up
a
cry
of
unmingled
ferocity
and
vindictiveness
caiaphas
forgetting
his
fear
of
defilement
advanced
several
steps
into
the
judgment
hall
and
shaking
his
open
hands
at
pilate
cried
if
thou
lettest
this
man
go
thou
art
not
cæsar
friend
thou
art
in
league
with
him
he
that
sets
himself
up
as
a
king
in
all
the
wide
bounds
of
cæsar
dominions
wars
against
cæsar
as
well
at
jerusalem
as
at
rome
if
thou
release
this
man
i
and
my
nation
will
accuse
thee
to
thy
master
tiberius
of
favoring
this
galilean
sedition
when
pilate
heard
the
name
of
galilee
he
asked
if
the
prisoner
were
a
galilean
upon
being
answered
in
the
affirmative
by
the
excited
priests
he
said
to
æmilius
hold
loose
not
his
bonds
just
now
herod
the
tetrarch
of
galilee
last
night
came
up
to
the
passover
feast
of
the
hebrew
god
and
is
now
at
the
old
maccabean
palace
with
his
retinue
conduct
your
prisoner
to
him
and
let
herod
judge
his
own
subjects
the
chief
priests
and
scribes
now
shouted
with
approbation
at
this
decision
for
they
began
to
fear
that
pilate
would
release
jesus
and
they
knew
that
the
vacillating
and
reckless
herod
would
do
whatsoever
would
gain
popular
applause
to
herod
to
the
tetrarch
of
galilee
with
him
arose
the
cry
but
caiaphas
frowning
and
dissatisfied
remained
behind
and
pilate
glad
to
get
rid
of
the
delicate
affair
of
condemning
an
innocent
man
smilingly
came
out
and
spoke
to
the
gloomy
high
priest
thou
knowest
i
can
condemn
men
only
for
crimes
committed
against
the
laws
of
the
empire
this
jesus
hath
done
nothing
worthy
of
death
noble
governor
answered
caiaphas
stopping
in
his
angry
strides
up
and
down
the
porphyry
floor
of
the
outer
portico
thou
forgettest
that
i
brought
him
not
before
thee
on
this
charge
of
blasphemy
alone
but
for
sedition
by
the
altar
of
god
this
is
a
crime
known
to
thy
laws
i
wot
true
you
charge
a
young
defenceless
quiet
powerless
man
destitute
of
money
men
or
arms
an
obscure
fisherman
or
carpenter
of
galilee
with
setting
up
a
throne
and
kingdom
against
that
of
tiberius
cæsar
the
ruler
of
the
earth
the
idea
is
absurd
it
should
be
treated
only
with
ridicule
so
will
herod
say
when
he
understands
the
affair
so
will
not
cæsar
say
my
lord
answered
caiaphas
with
a
sneer
upon
his
curled
lip
if
you
let
this
man
go
the
jewish
nation
will
draw
up
a
memorial
accusing
you
to
the
emperor
of
protecting
treason
you
will
be
summoned
by
the
senate
to
answer
the
charge
and
though
you
should
succeed
in
clearing
yourself
you
will
have
lost
your
government
given
to
another
and
for
your
fair
name
you
will
live
ever
after
under
cæsar
suspicion
pilate
turned
pale
and
bit
his
lips
with
vexation
my
lord
priest
thou
art
bent
i
see
on
this
innocent
man
death
i
am
no
jew
to
understand
how
he
has
drawn
upon
himself
thy
terrible
wrath
and
that
of
thy
nation
i
will
see
what
herod
will
say
who
being
a
jew
is
familiar
with
your
customs
pilate
now
reseated
himself
upon
his
throne
to
give
hearing
to
other
complaints
after
the
lapse
of
half
an
hour
a
youth
threw
himself
from
his
horse
at
the
door
of
the
court
and
drew
near
the
procurator
what
aileth
thee
alexander
demanded
pilate
on
seeing
blood
on
his
temples
and
that
he
seemed
faint
but
a
trifle
now
my
lord
i
was
thrown
from
my
horse
who
was
startled
at
a
burning
torch
lying
on
the
ground
and
was
detained
at
a
hospitable
house
until
i
was
able
to
remount
which
brings
me
hither
late
and
why
come
at
all
what
news
sends
my
fair
wife
that
she
should
despatch
you
from
my
house
in
bethany
at
this
early
hour
no
evil
tidings
boy
none
my
lord
save
this
note
the
greek
page
then
handed
his
master
a
small
roll
of
parchment
tied
with
scarlet
thread
he
cut
the
knot
with
his
dagger
and
reading
the
contents
became
deadly
pale
caiaphas
watched
him
closely
as
if
he
would
read
reflected
in
his
eyes
the
contents
of
the
note
which
had
so
deeply
moved
him
caiaphas
said
the
procurator
this
prisoner
must
be
released
illustration
jesus
before
pilate
it
is
either
his
destruction
proud
roman
or
thine
answered
the
high
priest
turning
and
walking
haughtily
away
pilate
looked
after
him
with
a
troubled
air
and
then
the
hall
of
judgment
and
seating
himself
upon
his
throne
again
read
the
parchment
nothing
to
do
with
this
just
man
he
read
half
aloud
i
have
suffered
many
things
this
day
in
a
dream
because
of
him
the
very
gods
seem
to
take
sides
with
this
extraordinary
young
prisoner
he
exclaimed
would
to
jove
that
herod
may
have
sense
enough
to
release
him
and
relieve
me
of
this
unpleasant
business
while
he
was
yet
speaking
and
musing
with
himself
unconsciously
aloud
there
was
heard
a
great
noise
of
voices
in
the
direction
of
the
maccabean
palace
and
as
it
grew
nearer
and
more
distinct
pilate
started
up
and
cried
it
is
as
i
feared
herod
gives
them
no
satisfaction
and
they
come
again
to
me
oh
that
the
gods
would
give
me
wisdom
and
nerve
for
this
trying
hour
so
that
i
condemn
not
the
innocent
nor
bring
myself
into
the
power
of
an
accusation
to
cæsar
from
these
wicked
jews
at
this
moment
the
multitude
increased
if
it
were
possible
in
numbers
and
in
vindictiveness
reappeared
pressing
jesus
before
them
this
time
he
was
alone
æmilius
having
been
separated
from
him
in
the
palace
and
kept
by
the
crowd
from
rejoining
him
he
was
now
unbound
and
upon
his
head
was
a
crown
of
thorns
piercing
the
tender
temples
till
the
blood
trickled
all
down
his
face
upon
his
shoulders
was
clasped
an
old
purple
robe
once
worn
by
herod
in
his
state
of
petty
king
and
his
hand
held
a
reed
as
a
scepter
and
as
he
walked
along
the
bitterest
among
the
priests
as
well
as
the
vilest
of
the
common
fellows
mockingly
bent
the
knee
before
him
crying
hail
king
jesus
hail
royal
nazarene
all
hail
others
went
before
him
carrying
mock
standards
while
still
others
acting
as
heralds
ran
shouting
make
way
for
the
king
of
the
jews
do
homage
all
men
to
cæsar
this
is
the
great
tiberius
emperor
of
nazareth
behold
his
glittering
crown
mark
his
royal
robes
and
see
his
dazzling
sceptre
bend
the
knee
bend
the
knee
men
of
judah
before
your
king
when
pilate
saw
this
spectacle
and
heard
these
words
he
trembled
and
was
heard
to
say
either
this
man
or
i
must
perish
these
jews
are
become
madmen
with
rage
and
demand
a
sacrifice
one
of
us
must
fall
oh
that
i
could
write
all
i
feel
but
i
am
compelled
my
dear
father
to
end
here
your
affectionate
child
adina
letter
xxxiii
my
dear
father
in
this
letter
will
be
continued
my
account
of
the
trial
if
such
it
can
be
called
of
jesus
john
the
faithful
and
yet
trusting
disciple
whom
jesus
loved
still
kept
near
his
captive
master
and
sought
to
cheer
him
by
affectionate
looks
and
where
he
could
do
it
with
safety
by
kind
acts
more
than
once
he
was
rudely
thrust
aside
by
the
fiercer
jews
and
once
several
men
seized
upon
him
and
would
have
done
him
violence
if
caiaphas
to
whom
john
is
remotely
related
and
who
knows
him
well
had
not
interposed
and
while
john
was
thus
doing
all
that
he
could
to
soften
the
asperity
of
his
friend
treatment
we
at
home
were
exerting
ourselves
to
soothe
the
maternal
solicitude
of
mary
of
nazareth
his
noble
and
heartbroken
mother
herod
the
tetrarch
of
galilee
was
breaking
his
fast
with
fruit
and
wine
at
a
table
overlooking
by
a
window
the
street
of
the
gentiles
when
the
noise
of
the
advancing
thousands
of
the
jews
reached
his
ear
he
started
from
the
table
and
said
these
people
are
surely
up
in
insurrection
against
pilate
no
great
prince
answered
the
lad
abel
his
cupbearer
who
is
related
to
john
and
has
told
me
many
of
these
things
they
have
taken
the
nazarene
prophet
jesus
and
are
trying
him
for
sedition
this
uproar
proceeds
from
no
trial
but
from
a
wild
mob
in
motion
and
they
seem
to
be
approaching
was
his
answer
to
him
as
herod
spoke
he
went
to
the
lattice
of
his
basilica
and
beheld
the
head
of
the
multitude
just
emerging
into
the
street
there
are
spears
and
romans
in
the
van
and
i
see
priests
and
peasants
mixed
together
i
now
see
the
cause
of
all
the
tumult
a
mere
youth
bound
and
soiled
and
pale
as
marble
what
sirs
this
is
not
the
great
prophet
of
whose
fame
i
have
heard
he
said
turning
to
his
officers
what
mean
they
by
bringing
him
hither
yet
per
baccho
i
am
glad
to
get
a
sight
of
him
the
crowd
like
the
swelling
nile
flowed
towards
the
gates
roaring
and
chafing
like
its
mighty
cataracts
so
that
there
was
something
fearfully
sublime
in
this
display
of
the
power
of
human
passions
æmilius
with
difficulty
succeeded
in
getting
his
prisoner
into
the
piazza
of
the
palace
most
royal
prince
said
æmilius
kneeling
before
herod
and
presenting
a
signet
i
am
sent
by
his
excellency
pontius
pilate
the
roman
procurator
of
judea
to
bring
before
you
this
person
accused
of
blasphemy
ignorant
of
your
customs
and
faith
the
governor
desires
that
you
who
are
of
his
nation
would
examine
him
and
moreover
pilate
learning
that
he
is
a
galilean
and
a
subject
of
your
jurisdiction
courteously
declines
interfering
with
your
authority
when
herod
antipas
heard
delivered
so
courteous
a
message
from
the
procurator
with
whom
he
had
been
some
time
at
enmity
he
was
pleased
say
thou
sir
knight
to
his
excellency
the
most
noble
and
princely
governor
of
judea
that
i
appreciate
his
extraordinary
civility
and
that
nothing
will
give
me
more
pleasure
in
return
for
such
distinguished
courtesy
than
to
be
considered
by
him
his
friend
and
that
i
regret
any
occurrence
that
has
hitherto
estranged
us
æmilius
upon
receiving
this
answer
arose
and
bowed
and
then
said
with
the
boldness
which
characterizes
him
most
gracious
and
royal
tetrarch
i
pray
you
heed
not
the
charges
of
these
jews
touching
this
prisoner
they
have
conceived
against
him
a
bitter
hatred
without
just
cause
he
has
done
nothing
worthy
of
death
pilate
could
find
nothing
whatsoever
in
him
deserving
of
the
attention
of
the
dignity
of
a
roman
tribunal
let
the
prisoner
fear
not
answered
herod
at
the
same
time
regarding
jesus
attentively
as
he
stood
before
him
in
the
calm
majesty
of
innocence
i
will
not
take
pilate
prerogative
of
judgment
out
of
his
hand
so
handsomely
tendered
to
me
if
he
hath
blasphemed
mehercule
the
high
priest
and
priests
of
the
temple
itself
he
added
laughing
do
that
every
day
of
their
lives
for
religion
is
at
a
low
ebb
among
the
hypocritical
knaves
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
their
charge
of
blasphemy
or
i
would
have
them
all
stoned
to
death
without
mercy
i
will
first
see
some
miracles
wrought
by
thy
prisoner
noble
æmilius
and
then
send
him
back
to
my
illustrious
friend
pontius
whom
his
gods
prosper
in
all
things
herod
then
fixing
his
eyes
curiously
upon
jesus
who
had
stood
silently
before
him
seemingly
the
only
unmoved
person
in
the
vast
concourse
said
to
the
soldiers
unbind
him
by
the
staff
of
jacob
he
hath
been
roughly
handled
men
of
israel
it
becomes
not
such
as
you
to
do
violence
to
a
man
before
he
is
condemned
while
he
was
speaking
john
arranged
jesus
mantle
about
his
form
herod
regarded
with
interest
and
looks
of
compassion
the
pale
and
countenance
of
the
prisoner
and
seemed
struck
with
the
indescribable
majesty
of
his
aspect
and
bearing
art
thou
the
nazarene
jesus
of
whom
i
have
heard
so
much
he
asked
in
deferential
tones
i
am
he
was
the
quiet
answer
then
gladly
do
i
meet
thee
for
i
have
long
time
desired
to
see
thee
and
i
would
fain
behold
thee
do
some
miracles
does
rumor
belie
thy
powers
what
art
thou
silent
dost
thou
not
know
who
it
is
that
speaks
to
thee
come
hither
fellow
he
called
to
a
samaritan
muleteer
who
stood
in
the
crowd
whose
oval
face
and
jewish
eyes
showed
him
to
be
both
of
assyrian
and
israelitish
descent
and
whose
arm
had
been
taken
off
by
a
sword
in
a
contest
with
barabbas
and
his
robbers
come
hither
and
let
this
prophet
prove
his
power
and
mission
by
restoring
thy
arm
whole
like
as
the
other
the
man
alertly
came
forward
and
all
eyes
were
directed
eagerly
upon
him
and
upon
jesus
but
he
thrust
the
stump
of
his
arm
by
order
in
vain
before
jesus
the
eyes
of
the
prophet
moved
not
from
their
meditative
look
upon
the
ground
art
thou
mocking
us
thou
false
christ
cried
the
tetrarch
angrily
wilt
thou
neither
speak
nor
act
if
thou
art
not
an
impostor
do
a
miracle
before
us
all
and
we
will
believe
in
thee
jesus
remained
motionless
yet
preserved
a
firm
and
majestic
countenance
he
is
a
deceiver
he
performed
his
works
through
beelzebub
who
has
now
deserted
him
cried
the
priests
nazarene
said
herod
i
am
a
jew
also
if
thou
wilt
prove
to
me
by
a
sign
that
i
will
name
that
thou
art
the
christ
i
will
not
only
become
thy
follower
but
will
let
thee
go
free
thy
silence
is
an
insult
to
my
power
thou
seest
yonder
marble
statue
of
judas
maccabeus
command
the
sword
in
its
hand
to
wave
thrice
above
its
helmeted
head
and
i
will
bend
the
knee
to
thee
nay
wilt
not
i
will
give
thee
then
something
easier
to
do
seest
thou
the
carved
pomegranates
in
the
entablature
of
the
wall
bid
the
one
which
hangs
over
this
column
become
ripe
natural
fruit
and
fall
at
my
feet
no
he
has
no
power
his
friend
beelzebub
hath
given
him
up
into
our
hands
death
to
the
necromancer
were
the
terrible
words
which
now
made
the
hall
tremble
see
the
whirlwind
thou
hast
raised
o
nazarene
cried
herod
rising
if
thou
art
a
prophet
no
harm
can
they
do
thee
and
if
thou
art
an
impostor
if
they
kill
thee
thou
deservest
thy
fate
i
give
thee
up
into
their
hands
save
thyself
if
thou
be
the
christ
scarcely
had
herod
spoken
these
words
relinquishing
jesus
into
the
hands
of
his
foes
than
with
a
savage
cry
as
the
famished
jackals
in
the
desert
rush
upon
their
prey
they
rushed
upon
their
victim
æmilius
could
not
protect
him
nay
some
of
herod
soldiers
whom
the
jews
had
half
intoxicated
with
wine
joined
them
as
soon
as
they
saw
their
master
antipas
had
cast
him
off
and
began
to
scoff
and
mock
him
and
one
of
them
thrust
a
helmet
on
his
head
and
pulled
the
visor
down
over
his
eyes
nay
said
herod
on
seeing
this
as
he
calls
himself
a
king
remove
the
helmet
and
crown
him
and
robe
him
royally
and
place
a
sceptre
in
his
hand
and
lo
yonder
block
will
make
him
a
proper
throne
we
must
show
pilate
how
we
jews
serve
men
who
usurp
the
power
of
his
master
cæsar
one
of
his
men
of
war
brought
a
robe
of
purple
which
belonged
to
herod
and
with
loud
shouts
of
laughter
and
coarse
jests
they
robed
him
in
it
unresisting
as
the
lamb
wreathed
for
the
sacrifice
some
one
then
twined
the
creeping
thorn
which
grew
on
the
outer
wall
and
twisting
it
into
the
shape
of
a
crown
handed
it
over
the
heads
of
the
men
to
abner
when
abner
saw
the
crown
he
smiled
with
malicious
gratification
and
nodding
approvingly
to
the
man
said
this
is
what
we
needed
nothing
could
have
done
better
and
with
his
two
hands
he
placed
it
upon
the
head
of
jesus
pressing
cruelly
the
sharp
thorns
into
his
temples
till
the
blood
trickled
from
a
dozen
wounds
jesus
made
no
complaint
but
the
pain
forced
large
bright
tears
from
his
eyes
which
rolled
down
his
cheeks
and
fell
among
the
purple
robe
like
glittering
pearls
here
is
also
a
sceptre
for
our
king
exclaimed
the
samaritan
with
one
arm
using
the
one
to
reach
a
piece
of
reed
from
which
a
passover
lamb
had
been
slung
to
those
who
were
arraying
jesus
this
was
thrust
into
the
prophet
grasp
and
he
held
it
patiently
his
submission
his
silence
his
endurance
of
pain
his
constant
dignity
and
the
majestic
submission
which
he
seemed
to
manifest
to
all
their
insults
and
tortures
brought
tears
into
the
eyes
of
æmilius
even
herod
stood
amazed
at
such
forbearance
and
said
to
his
chief
captain
if
this
man
is
not
the
son
of
god
he
is
worthy
to
be
deified
such
sublime
patience
is
more
than
human
it
is
divine
you
romans
æmilius
would
make
a
hero
of
such
a
man
and
when
he
died
worship
him
as
a
god
then
mighty
prince
why
suffer
him
to
be
thus
treated
asked
æmilius
it
is
his
own
choice
i
have
entreated
him
fairly
i
asked
of
him
but
one
of
those
miracles
men
say
he
works
as
proof
of
his
messiahship
and
he
works
me
none
shows
me
no
sign
the
inference
is
that
he
can
do
none
and
therefore
he
is
an
impostor
most
royal
prince
said
abner
aloud
thou
now
beholdest
the
king
of
the
jews
crowned
robed
and
sceptred
and
he
pointed
to
jesus
hail
most
puissant
and
potent
sovereign
of
galilee
hail
king
of
fishermen
cried
herod
mocking
him
and
seemingly
greatly
amused
at
the
jest
hail
powerful
king
what
fellows
and
all
ye
gapers
bend
ye
not
the
knee
before
this
royal
personage
do
homage
to
your
king
upon
this
many
who
were
around
him
kneeled
and
some
mockingly
even
prostrated
themselves
before
the
prophet
but
he
stood
so
very
like
a
monarch
that
others
who
were
about
to
mock
him
refrained
while
herod
turned
away
with
a
troubled
look
saying
abruptly
take
him
back
to
the
procurator
once
more
the
vast
multitude
were
in
motion
and
with
cries
and
insults
escorted
jesus
from
the
presence
of
herod
back
to
the
pretorium
when
pilate
beheld
their
return
in
this
manner
he
was
greatly
vexed
when
once
more
jesus
stood
before
him
arrayed
as
i
have
described
in
the
gorgeous
robe
and
crown
pilate
turning
towards
caiaphas
and
the
priests
said
angrily
what
more
will
ye
have
why
bring
this
man
again
before
me
behold
i
have
examined
him
before
you
and
have
found
no
fault
in
him
ye
proved
nothing
by
your
witnesses
touching
those
things
whereof
ye
accuse
him
i
then
sent
you
with
him
to
herod
and
lo
the
tetrarch
of
galilee
one
of
your
own
nation
finds
naught
in
him
worthy
of
death
doubtless
he
has
said
something
about
not
paying
tribute
and
deserves
for
this
a
light
punishment
but
not
death
i
will
chastise
him
charge
him
that
he
be
more
cautious
and
let
him
go
if
thou
let
this
man
go
thou
art
an
enemy
of
tiberius
answered
caiaphas
seest
thou
what
a
commotion
he
has
raised
in
the
city
if
he
is
released
there
will
be
a
revolution
in
the
name
of
olympian
jove
o
nazarene
what
hast
thou
done
to
incense
these
jews
if
thou
art
their
king
prove
it
to
them
or
to
me
demanded
pilate
greatly
troubled
my
kingdom
is
not
of
the
earth
answered
jesus
if
my
kingdom
were
an
earthly
one
then
would
my
servants
fight
that
i
should
not
be
delivered
to
the
jews
but
my
kingdom
is
not
of
this
world
then
thou
confessest
thyself
a
king
exclaimed
pilate
with
surprise
thou
sayest
that
which
i
am
a
king
to
this
end
was
i
born
and
for
this
cause
came
i
into
the
world
that
i
should
bear
witness
to
the
truth
truth
what
is
truth
asked
the
roman
but
without
waiting
for
jesus
to
reply
and
seeing
that
the
jews
outside
of
the
hall
were
becoming
more
and
more
impatient
he
hurriedly
went
out
to
them
and
said
i
find
in
the
prisoner
no
fault
at
all
but
ye
have
a
custom
that
i
should
at
the
passover
pardon
a
criminal
out
of
prison
as
an
act
of
clemency
in
honor
of
the
day
will
ye
therefore
that
i
pardon
and
release
unto
you
this
of
the
jews
no
sooner
had
pilate
made
this
proposal
than
they
all
with
one
voice
and
furious
gestures
cried
no
no
not
this
man
we
will
not
have
him
released
barabbas
barabbas
was
echoed
and
by
ten
thousand
voices
this
barabbas
dear
father
is
the
same
fierce
bandit
of
whom
i
have
spoken
who
was
that
day
to
have
been
crucified
with
two
of
his
lieutenants
but
at
the
loud
demand
of
the
people
pilate
was
forced
to
send
to
the
officer
of
the
wards
to
let
him
go
free
pilate
therefore
finding
that
the
jews
would
be
content
with
nothing
less
than
the
blood
of
jesus
returned
sorrowfully
into
the
judgment
hall
the
residue
of
my
narrative
of
the
condemnation
and
crucifixion
i
will
give
in
the
morning
dear
father
your
loving
daughter
adina
letter
xxxiv
my
dearest
father
jesus
had
from
very
weakness
sunk
upon
the
steps
of
the
throne
of
the
hall
of
judgment
john
knelt
by
him
bathing
the
wounds
in
his
temples
from
off
which
he
had
boldly
taken
the
crown
of
thorns
when
pilate
after
giving
the
order
to
release
the
robber
chief
barabbas
came
again
where
jesus
was
he
stopped
and
regarded
him
attentively
and
with
an
expression
of
sorrow
and
admiration
at
length
he
spoke
if
thou
be
indeed
a
god
o
heroic
young
man
as
thy
patience
would
seem
to
prove
thee
to
be
thou
needest
not
to
fear
these
bloodhounds
that
bay
so
fiercely
for
thy
blood
if
thou
art
an
impostor
and
a
seditionist
thou
verily
meritest
death
i
regard
thee
but
as
a
youthful
enthusiast
and
would
let
thee
go
free
but
i
can
not
protect
thee
if
i
release
thee
not
only
thou
but
also
all
my
troops
will
be
massacred
for
we
are
but
a
handful
in
their
grasp
tell
me
truly
art
thou
a
son
of
the
divine
jupiter
when
jesus
instead
of
replying
remained
silent
the
procurator
said
sternly
what
speakest
thou
not
unto
me
knowest
thou
not
that
i
have
power
to
crucify
thee
as
a
malefactor
and
power
if
i
choose
to
meet
the
risk
to
release
thee
jesus
looked
up
and
calmly
said
thou
couldst
have
no
power
against
me
except
it
were
given
thee
from
above
therefore
he
that
delivered
me
into
thy
hands
hath
the
greater
sin
and
as
jesus
said
these
words
in
an
impressive
tone
he
glanced
fixedly
at
caiaphas
who
was
looking
in
at
the
door
as
if
designating
the
high
priest
upon
this
pilate
pressed
his
hands
against
his
forehead
and
paced
several
times
to
and
fro
before
the
judgment
seat
as
if
greatly
troubled
caiaphas
seeing
his
irresolution
cried
harshly
if
thou
lettest
this
king
go
o
governor
thou
art
not
cæsar
friend
pilate
brow
grew
dark
he
took
jesus
by
the
hand
and
leading
him
to
the
portal
pointed
to
him
and
said
aloud
behold
your
king
what
will
you
that
i
should
do
with
him
looks
he
like
a
man
to
be
feared
we
have
no
king
but
cæsar
crucify
him
to
the
cross
with
the
false
prophet
death
to
the
usurper
long
live
cæsar
death
to
the
nazarene
to
the
cross
to
the
cross
with
him
let
him
be
crucified
these
were
the
various
cries
from
ten
thousand
throats
that
responded
to
the
procurator
address
remembering
the
warning
message
sent
him
by
his
young
and
beautiful
wife
who
held
great
influence
over
him
he
trembled
with
indecision
why
will
you
compel
me
to
crucify
an
innocent
man
what
evil
hath
he
done
crucify
him
crucify
him
was
the
deafening
response
i
will
chastise
him
and
let
him
go
at
your
peril
release
him
o
roman
exclaimed
caiaphas
in
a
menacing
tone
either
he
or
you
must
die
this
day
for
the
people
blood
must
flow
to
appease
this
tempest
when
the
procurator
saw
that
he
could
prevail
nothing
but
that
rather
the
tumult
increased
he
called
for
water
which
was
brought
to
him
in
a
basin
by
his
page
and
in
the
presence
of
the
whole
multitude
he
washed
his
hands
saying
i
am
innocent
of
the
blood
of
this
just
person
see
ye
to
it
o
jews
ye
and
your
high
priest
his
blood
be
upon
us
and
on
our
children
answered
caiaphas
and
all
the
people
his
language
ay
on
us
and
on
our
children
rest
the
guilt
of
his
blood
be
it
so
answered
the
procurator
with
a
dark
brow
and
face
as
pale
as
the
dead
take
ye
him
and
crucify
him
and
may
the
god
he
worships
judge
you
not
me
for
this
day
deed
pilate
then
turned
away
from
them
and
said
to
jesus
thou
art
i
feel
an
innocent
man
but
thou
seest
that
i
can
not
save
thee
i
know
thou
wilt
forgive
me
and
that
death
can
have
no
terrors
for
one
of
fortitude
like
thine
jesus
made
him
no
answer
and
pilate
turning
from
him
with
a
sad
countenance
walked
slowly
away
and
left
the
judgment
hall
as
he
did
so
one
of
his
captains
said
to
him
shall
i
scourge
him
my
lord
according
to
the
roman
law
which
commands
all
who
are
sentenced
to
die
to
be
scourged
do
as
the
law
commands
answered
the
roman
his
disappearance
was
the
signal
for
a
general
rush
towards
jesus
chiefly
by
the
rabble
who
indifferent
about
gentile
defilement
crossed
the
threshold
into
the
hall
which
the
chief
priests
had
refrained
from
doing
these
base
fellows
seized
jesus
and
aided
by
the
dragged
him
forth
into
the
outer
or
common
hall
here
they
stripped
him
and
by
order
of
the
chief
captain
a
soldier
scourged
him
with
forty
stripes
save
one
all
this
jesus
still
bore
with
majesty
not
a
murmur
escaped
his
lips
not
a
glance
of
resentment
kindled
the
holy
depths
of
his
eyes
which
from
time
to
time
were
uplifted
to
heaven
as
if
he
sought
for
help
and
strength
from
thence
not
only
æmilius
but
john
was
now
separated
from
him
but
my
uncle
the
rabbi
stood
near
in
order
to
see
what
would
follow
and
to
use
his
influence
if
possible
to
induce
the
chief
priests
to
abandon
the
idea
of
killing
him
good
rabbi
said
jesus
to
him
let
them
do
with
me
what
they
list
my
father
hath
given
me
into
their
hands
i
die
but
not
for
myself
i
can
keep
or
yield
up
my
life
as
i
will
oh
then
dear
master
cried
my
uncle
why
not
save
thyself
why
shouldst
thou
suffer
all
this
and
death
also
if
thou
hast
the
power
over
thy
life
if
i
die
not
then
were
ye
all
dead
the
scripture
must
be
fulfilled
which
spoke
of
me
was
led
like
a
lamb
to
the
slaughter
here
rabbi
amos
could
speak
no
more
to
him
for
the
crowd
dragged
him
off
out
of
the
court
of
gabbatha
and
so
down
the
steep
street
in
the
direction
of
the
gate
of
the
kings
that
leads
out
to
calvary
the
public
place
of
execution
rabbi
amos
accompanied
the
multitude
keeping
as
nigh
to
jesus
as
the
roman
soldiers
who
marched
on
each
side
of
him
would
permit
on
the
way
as
they
crossed
the
open
space
where
once
stood
the
palace
and
statue
of
antiochus
seleucus
the
eyes
of
the
rabbi
were
attracted
by
the
cries
and
pointed
fingers
of
many
of
the
people
to
the
body
of
a
man
lying
dead
at
the
foot
of
a
withered
fig
tree
upon
drawing
nearer
he
recognized
the
features
of
the
man
judas
who
had
so
basely
betrayed
his
master
the
spectacle
which
he
exhibited
was
revolting
and
horrid
to
look
upon
about
his
neck
was
wound
a
fragment
of
his
girdle
the
other
half
being
still
secured
to
a
limb
of
the
tree
showing
how
he
had
met
his
fate
by
this
time
the
people
who
were
dragging
jesus
to
death
were
got
well
beyond
the
gate
when
a
cross
of
heavy
cypress
was
obtained
by
the
centurion
from
a
yard
near
the
lodge
two
others
were
also
brought
out
and
laid
upon
the
shoulders
of
two
men
the
lieutenants
of
barabbas
who
were
also
that
day
to
be
crucified
by
the
time
the
great
crowd
had
passed
the
gate
it
was
known
throughout
all
jerusalem
that
pilate
had
given
orders
for
the
crucifixion
of
the
nazarene
prophet
and
with
one
mind
all
who
had
known
him
and
believed
in
him
or
loved
him
left
their
houses
to
go
out
after
him
to
witness
the
crucifixion
for
i
forgot
to
say
that
caiaphas
had
promised
if
jesus
were
delivered
up
that
his
followers
should
not
be
molested
therefore
every
person
went
out
of
the
gate
towards
calvary
mary
his
mother
my
cousin
mary
martha
and
her
sister
lazarus
john
peter
and
thomas
and
some
women
relatives
from
galilee
and
many
others
also
went
when
we
got
without
the
walls
we
seemed
to
leave
a
deserted
city
behind
us
as
far
as
the
eye
could
embrace
there
was
a
countless
multitude
jesus
was
borne
in
front
where
we
could
now
and
then
catch
the
gleam
of
a
roman
spear
we
hastened
to
get
near
him
and
with
difficulty
made
our
way
to
the
head
of
the
throng
both
foes
and
friends
giving
back
when
they
saw
his
weeping
mother
among
us
at
the
approach
to
calvary
we
found
that
from
some
cause
the
course
of
the
mighty
current
of
human
beings
was
checked
we
soon
learned
the
reason
jesus
had
sunk
to
the
ground
under
the
weight
of
the
wooden
beams
on
which
he
was
to
die
and
fainted
he
is
dead
was
the
cry
of
those
about
him
but
as
we
drew
near
he
was
just
reviving
some
one
having
offered
wine
to
his
lips
and
poured
water
upon
his
brow
he
stood
up
looking
mildly
around
when
meeting
his
mother
gaze
he
said
touchingly
weep
not
my
mother
remember
what
i
have
often
told
thee
of
this
hour
and
believe
mine
hour
is
come
thus
speaking
he
smiled
upon
his
mother
and
upon
us
with
a
certain
look
of
divine
peace
illuminating
his
countenance
barabbas
the
robber
chief
who
had
in
some
degree
taken
the
lead
of
the
mob
now
with
the
aid
of
three
men
raised
the
cross
again
to
the
shoulders
of
jesus
and
the
soldier
ordered
him
to
move
on
but
the
young
victim
sank
at
once
beneath
the
insupportable
load
upon
this
they
were
at
a
loss
what
to
do
for
it
is
ignominious
for
jew
or
gentile
to
aid
in
bearing
a
malefactor
cross
and
not
a
roman
would
touch
it
at
this
crisis
they
discerned
a
merchant
simon
of
cyrene
a
venerable
man
well
known
to
all
in
jerusalem
this
man
was
for
some
reason
particularly
obnoxious
to
abner
and
on
seeing
him
he
pointed
him
out
to
the
centurion
as
one
of
the
nazarenes
and
suggested
that
he
should
be
compelled
to
bear
the
cross
after
jesus
the
cyrenian
merchant
was
at
once
dragged
from
his
mule
and
led
to
the
place
where
the
cross
lay
believing
he
was
about
to
be
himself
executed
but
when
he
beheld
jesus
standing
pale
and
bleeding
by
the
fallen
cross
and
knew
what
was
required
of
him
he
burst
into
tears
and
kneeling
at
his
feet
said
if
they
compel
me
to
do
this
lord
think
not
that
i
aid
thy
death
i
know
that
thou
art
a
prophet
come
from
god
we
brought
thee
not
here
to
prate
old
man
but
to
work
thou
art
up
with
this
end
of
the
cross
and
go
on
after
him
cried
the
chief
priests
simon
who
is
a
powerful
man
though
threescore
years
of
age
raised
the
extremity
of
the
beam
and
jesus
essayed
to
move
under
the
weight
of
the
other
but
he
failed
let
me
bear
it
alone
master
answered
the
stout
simon
i
am
the
stronger
thou
hast
enough
to
bear
the
weight
of
thine
own
sorrow
if
it
be
a
shame
to
bear
a
cross
after
thee
i
glory
in
my
shame
as
would
my
two
sons
were
they
here
this
day
thus
speaking
he
lifted
the
cross
and
bore
it
on
his
shoulders
after
jesus
who
weak
from
loss
of
blood
and
sleep
and
weary
unto
death
had
to
lean
for
support
against
one
arm
of
the
instrument
of
death
ah
my
dear
father
what
a
place
was
this
across
which
we
moved
skulls
lay
scattered
beneath
our
footsteps
and
everywhere
human
bones
bleached
in
the
air
and
we
trod
in
heaps
of
ashes
where
the
romans
had
burned
the
bodies
of
many
of
those
whom
they
crucified
the
crosses
carried
by
the
thieves
were
now
thrown
down
by
them
by
one
with
an
execration
by
the
other
with
a
sigh
as
he
anticipated
the
anguish
he
was
to
suffer
upon
it
the
larger
cross
of
the
three
was
that
for
jesus
it
was
taken
by
three
soldiers
from
the
back
of
the
old
cyrenian
merchant
and
cast
heavily
upon
the
earth
it
was
now
that
a
crisis
approached
of
the
most
painful
interest
the
centurion
ordered
his
soldiers
to
clear
a
circle
about
the
place
where
the
crosses
were
to
be
planted
with
their
spears
the
jews
who
had
crowded
near
in
eager
thirst
for
their
victim
blood
gave
back
slowly
and
reluctantly
before
the
sharp
points
of
the
roman
lances
pushed
against
their
breasts
for
the
centurion
had
with
him
full
threescore
besides
a
part
of
herod
guard
john
however
held
his
place
close
by
his
master
he
relates
that
jesus
continued
to
evince
the
same
sublime
composure
when
the
centurion
commanded
the
crucifiers
to
advance
and
nail
the
malefactors
to
their
crosses
the
ishmerai
who
was
an
edomite
upon
seeing
the
man
approach
with
the
basket
containing
the
spikes
and
hammers
scowled
fiercely
upon
him
and
looked
defiance
he
was
instantly
seized
by
four
parthian
soldiers
of
the
roman
guard
and
stripped
and
thrown
upon
his
back
upon
the
cross
his
struggles
for
he
was
an
athletic
man
were
so
violent
that
it
took
six
persons
to
keep
him
held
down
upon
the
arms
of
the
cross
and
his
palms
spread
open
to
receive
the
entering
nail
which
one
of
the
crucifiers
with
naked
and
brawny
arms
pressing
one
knee
upon
the
wrist
drove
in
through
the
flesh
and
wood
by
three
quick
and
powerful
blows
with
his
short
hammer
thus
secured
he
was
left
bleeding
and
writhing
by
the
six
crucifiers
for
there
are
four
to
bind
the
victim
one
to
hold
the
spikes
and
the
sixth
to
drive
them
home
with
his
hammer
and
from
the
glance
i
caught
of
their
and
figures
they
were
worthy
to
hold
the
dreadful
office
which
made
all
men
shun
them
as
if
they
were
leprous
they
now
approached
omri
the
other
robber
who
was
a
young
man
with
a
mild
look
and
a
face
whose
noble
lineaments
did
not
betray
his
profession
he
was
the
son
of
a
wealthy
citizen
in
jericho
and
had
by
riotous
living
spent
his
patrimony
and
joined
barabbas
he
had
heard
jesus
preach
in
the
wilderness
of
jordan
and
had
once
asked
him
with
deep
interest
many
things
touching
the
doctrines
he
taught
when
the
crucifiers
with
their
cords
basket
nails
and
iron
hammer
drew
near
him
he
said
i
will
not
compel
you
to
throw
me
down
i
can
die
as
i
have
lived
without
fear
as
i
have
broken
the
laws
i
am
ready
to
suffer
the
penalty
of
the
laws
thus
speaking
he
stretched
himself
upon
his
cross
and
extending
his
palms
along
the
transverse
beam
he
suffered
them
to
nail
him
to
the
wood
uttering
not
a
moan
he
glanced
towards
jesus
at
the
same
time
with
an
expression
of
courage
as
if
he
sought
to
show
him
that
the
pain
could
be
borne
by
a
brave
man
and
perhaps
indeed
jesus
looked
as
if
he
needed
an
heroic
example
before
him
to
show
him
how
to
die
without
shrinking
for
his
cheek
was
like
the
marble
of
paros
in
its
whiteness
and
he
seemed
ready
to
drop
to
the
earth
from
weakness
his
youth
his
almost
divine
beauty
which
not
even
his
tangled
hair
and
torn
beard
and
countenance
could
wholly
hide
the
air
of
celestial
innocence
that
beamed
from
his
eyes
drew
upon
him
many
glances
of
sympathy
even
from
some
of
his
foes
the
centurion
who
was
a
tall
man
with
a
grizzly
beard
and
with
the
hardy
exterior
of
an
old
roman
warrior
looked
upon
him
with
a
sad
gaze
and
said
i
do
not
see
what
men
hate
thee
for
for
thou
seemest
more
to
be
a
man
of
love
but
i
must
do
my
duty
and
i
hope
thou
wilt
forgive
me
what
i
do
a
soldier
honor
is
to
obey
jesus
smiled
forgiveness
upon
him
so
sweetly
that
the
stern
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
he
placed
his
gauntleted
hand
to
his
face
to
conceal
his
emotion
but
my
dear
father
i
can
go
on
no
longer
now
with
my
sad
narrative
i
am
weary
weeping
at
the
recollections
it
calls
before
me
and
at
our
present
affliction
in
my
next
i
will
complete
my
account
of
the
unhappy
crucifixion
of
the
prophet
of
nazareth
your
affectionate
daughter
adina
letter
xxxv
third
morning
after
the
my
dear
father
as
i
resume
my
pen
by
the
faint
light
of
the
dawn
to
continue
the
particulars
of
the
crucifixion
of
the
unhappy
son
of
mary
who
widowed
and
childless
still
remains
with
us
mourning
over
her
dead
son
my
heart
involuntarily
shrinks
from
the
painful
subject
and
bleeds
afresh
but
there
is
a
fascination
associated
with
all
that
concerns
him
even
now
that
he
is
dead
and
has
proved
himself
as
weak
a
mortal
as
other
men
which
urges
me
to
write
of
him
and
which
fills
my
thoughts
only
with
him
i
have
just
alluded
to
his
mother
alas
there
is
no
consolation
for
her
her
loss
is
not
like
that
of
other
mothers
her
son
has
not
only
been
taken
from
her
by
death
but
has
died
ignominiously
on
a
roman
cross
executed
between
two
vile
malefactors
as
if
he
himself
were
the
greatest
criminal
of
the
three
and
not
only
this
but
executed
as
a
false
prophet
as
a
deceiver
of
israel
yet
her
love
for
her
son
that
deathless
maternal
love
which
seems
immortal
in
its
nature
is
not
buried
with
him
she
with
dearest
mary
and
martha
has
just
gone
out
secretly
before
the
jews
are
astir
to
pay
the
last
duties
to
his
dead
body
ere
we
all
depart
for
an
asylum
in
bethany
until
they
return
from
this
sad
mission
of
love
i
will
continue
my
subject
the
crucifixion
when
the
centurion
to
whom
was
committed
by
pilate
the
charge
of
conducting
the
crucifixion
of
jesus
gave
orders
to
bind
him
also
to
the
cross
which
lay
upon
the
ground
like
an
altar
awaiting
its
victim
the
four
parthian
soldiers
his
brutal
crucifiers
laid
hold
upon
him
and
began
to
strip
him
of
his
garments
for
his
enemies
had
put
again
on
him
his
own
clothes
when
they
led
him
out
of
the
hall
of
pilate
he
wore
a
mantle
woven
without
seam
by
mary
and
martha
and
which
had
been
a
present
to
him
by
the
sisters
as
a
token
of
their
gratitude
for
raising
from
the
dead
their
brother
lazarus
his
mother
supported
by
john
could
no
longer
gaze
upon
her
son
and
was
borne
afar
off
crying
thrillingly
oh
let
me
not
hear
the
crashing
of
the
nails
into
his
feet
and
hands
my
son
my
son
oh
that
thou
wouldst
now
prove
to
thy
mother
that
thou
art
a
true
prophet
what
means
this
wailing
cried
the
fierce
abner
who
is
this
woman
the
mother
of
jesus
i
answered
indignantly
the
mother
of
the
blasphemer
let
her
be
accursed
he
cried
in
a
savage
tone
thou
seest
woman
what
is
the
end
of
bringing
up
an
impostor
to
blaspheme
jehovah
and
the
temple
thy
hopes
and
his
o
wretched
woman
have
this
day
miserably
perished
so
die
all
false
christs
and
false
prophets
mary
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
and
wept
on
my
shoulder
i
could
not
look
towards
the
place
where
jesus
stood
i
dreaded
to
hear
the
first
blow
upon
the
dreadful
nails
and
as
she
stopped
her
ears
i
would
have
closed
mine
also
but
that
my
hands
supported
her
i
could
hear
the
awful
preparations
the
rattling
of
the
hard
cord
as
they
bound
him
to
the
cross
and
the
low
eager
voices
of
the
four
busy
parthians
and
then
the
ringing
of
the
spikes
and
then
silence
like
that
of
the
grave
suddenly
a
blow
of
a
hammer
broke
the
moment
of
suspense
a
shriek
burst
from
the
soul
of
the
mother
that
echoed
far
and
wide
among
the
tombs
of
golgotha
i
could
see
hear
no
more
john
having
left
the
stricken
mother
with
me
he
and
lazarus
had
gone
back
to
where
they
were
unrobing
the
prophet
in
order
to
bind
him
to
the
wood
they
caught
the
eyes
of
their
master
said
lazarus
who
gazed
upon
them
calmly
and
affectionately
they
said
they
had
never
beheld
him
appear
so
majestic
and
great
he
looked
as
the
centurion
afterwards
said
like
a
god
surrendering
himself
to
death
for
the
safety
of
his
universe
nothing
but
the
ferocious
madness
of
the
chief
priests
and
jews
added
john
could
have
prevented
them
from
being
awed
by
the
majesty
of
his
presence
and
besides
there
sat
upon
his
brow
heroic
courage
with
a
certain
divine
humility
and
resignation
not
the
rough
hands
of
the
barbaric
soldiers
nor
the
indignity
of
being
stripped
before
the
eyes
of
thousands
not
the
sight
of
the
cross
nor
of
the
thieves
nailed
and
writhing
on
theirs
moved
him
to
depart
by
look
or
bearing
from
that
celestial
dignity
which
through
all
had
never
left
him
he
made
no
resistance
continued
john
who
told
me
what
follows
when
bound
upon
the
cross
but
resigned
himself
passively
into
the
hands
of
his
executioners
like
a
lamb
receiving
its
death
he
said
raising
his
holy
eyes
to
heaven
them
for
they
know
not
what
they
do
great
drops
of
sweat
when
they
nailed
his
feet
to
the
wood
stood
upon
his
forehead
added
john
who
remained
near
to
see
his
master
die
and
to
comfort
and
strengthen
him
and
when
the
four
men
raised
him
and
the
cross
together
from
the
earth
and
let
the
end
into
a
hole
a
foot
deep
the
shock
bringing
his
whole
weight
upon
the
nails
in
his
hands
tore
and
lacerated
them
nearly
dislocating
the
shoulders
at
the
same
time
while
every
sinew
and
muscle
of
his
arms
and
chest
was
drawn
out
like
cords
to
sustain
this
unwonted
weight
upon
them
the
first
thief
fainted
from
pain
at
the
shock
caused
by
the
setting
of
his
own
cross
and
the
second
cool
and
defiant
as
he
had
been
uttered
a
loud
outcry
of
agony
but
jesus
made
no
moan
though
the
unearthly
pallor
of
his
countenance
showed
how
inexpressible
was
his
torture
ah
my
dear
father
i
would
draw
a
veil
over
this
scene
for
it
is
too
painful
for
me
to
dwell
upon
to
the
last
john
believed
his
master
would
not
die
that
he
would
not
suffer
but
when
he
saw
how
that
pain
and
anguish
seized
heavily
upon
him
and
how
that
he
suffered
like
other
men
without
power
to
prevent
it
he
greatly
wondered
and
began
to
believe
that
all
the
miracles
that
he
had
seen
him
perform
must
have
been
illusions
he
could
not
reconcile
the
calmness
and
dignity
the
heroic
composure
and
air
of
innocence
with
which
he
came
to
the
cross
with
imposture
yet
his
death
would
assuredly
seal
as
imposture
all
his
previous
career
with
his
mother
we
all
drew
as
near
the
cross
as
we
were
permitted
to
come
jesus
then
turned
his
head
towards
his
mother
and
looking
down
with
the
profoundest
tenderness
and
love
upon
her
committed
her
to
the
filial
care
of
the
weeping
john
who
stood
supporting
her
there
we
waited
in
expectation
of
seeing
him
do
some
mighty
miracle
from
the
cross
and
descend
unharmed
showing
to
the
world
thereby
his
title
to
be
the
messias
of
god
the
centurion
having
placed
a
guard
about
the
crosses
to
keep
the
friends
of
the
crucified
from
attempting
their
rescue
stood
watching
them
the
soldiers
who
had
nailed
jesus
to
the
tree
now
began
to
divide
with
noisy
oaths
his
garments
among
themselves
as
well
as
those
of
the
two
thieves
these
being
by
the
roman
law
the
fee
of
the
executioner
this
division
being
made
after
some
time
but
not
without
high
talking
and
drawing
of
their
long
syrian
knives
upon
each
other
they
were
at
a
loss
what
to
do
with
the
large
mantle
without
seam
which
the
sisters
of
lazarus
had
woven
for
the
friend
of
their
once
dead
brother
a
group
of
the
roman
guard
being
seated
near
astride
upon
the
four
arms
of
a
fallen
cross
playing
at
dice
suggested
that
the
parthians
should
decide
by
lot
whose
it
should
be
this
the
latter
consented
to
and
taking
the
in
their
bloody
hands
each
of
them
threw
the
dice
the
highest
number
fell
to
the
most
ferocious
of
the
four
fellows
who
proposed
to
sell
the
cloak
which
john
joyfully
purchased
of
him
at
a
great
price
by
means
of
the
jewels
of
several
of
the
women
who
gladly
took
rings
from
their
ears
and
bracelets
from
their
arms
i
giving
dear
father
the
emerald
which
you
bought
for
me
at
cairo
but
i
could
not
see
the
robe
which
jesus
had
worn
thus
desecrated
after
jesus
had
hung
about
an
hour
upon
the
cross
æmilius
came
from
pilate
and
bore
the
inscription
which
it
is
usual
to
place
above
the
heads
of
malefactors
showing
their
name
and
the
crime
for
which
they
are
crucified
above
the
head
of
jesus
by
means
of
a
small
ladder
was
placed
this
inscription
in
greek
latin
and
hebrew
this
is
jesus
the
king
of
the
jews
when
the
wicked
abner
read
this
he
turned
angrily
to
the
centurion
and
to
æmilius
who
stood
sadly
near
the
cross
write
not
o
roman
that
he
is
of
the
jews
but
that
he
said
he
was
king
of
the
jews
i
have
placed
above
him
what
pilate
has
ordered
to
be
written
answered
the
centurion
abner
upon
this
mounted
a
mule
and
hastened
into
the
city
to
the
procurator
and
laid
his
complaint
before
him
what
i
have
written
i
have
written
sir
priest
we
have
heard
that
the
procurator
coldly
answered
but
you
then
have
crucified
this
man
for
being
our
king
which
we
deny
retorted
abner
i
will
take
his
word
before
that
of
all
the
jews
in
cæsar
empire
answered
pilate
angrily
he
said
he
was
a
king
and
if
ever
a
king
stood
before
a
human
tribunal
i
have
had
a
true
and
very
king
before
me
and
i
have
signed
the
warrant
for
his
execution
but
his
blood
be
on
your
heads
leave
my
presence
jew
abner
left
his
presence
abashed
and
returned
to
the
place
of
crucifixion
the
jews
in
the
meanwhile
mocked
jesus
and
wagged
their
heads
at
him
and
reminded
him
of
his
former
miracles
and
prophecies
thou
that
raisedst
lazarus
save
thyself
from
death
said
a
pharisee
if
thou
art
the
son
of
god
prove
it
by
coming
down
from
the
cross
cried
the
leader
of
the
sadducees
eli
thou
who
saidst
if
a
man
kept
thy
sayings
he
should
never
see
death
let
us
see
if
thou
canst
avoid
death
thyself
said
iddo
the
chief
of
the
essenes
he
saved
others
himself
he
can
not
save
mocked
ezekias
one
of
the
chief
priests
æmilius
finding
it
impossible
to
save
the
prophet
from
crucifixion
had
come
out
to
guard
him
from
the
usual
insults
of
the
rabble
while
he
was
dying
he
had
now
lost
faith
in
jesus
as
a
jewish
prophet
but
he
loved
him
still
as
a
man
and
pitied
him
for
his
sufferings
he
talked
with
him
and
earnestly
prayed
him
as
he
hung
if
he
were
indeed
a
god
to
show
his
power
jesus
at
first
made
no
reply
but
he
shortly
said
in
a
faint
voice
i
thirst
the
generous
knight
ran
and
filled
a
sponge
with
the
preparation
of
sour
wine
and
hyssop
usually
given
to
malefactors
after
they
have
suffered
awhile
in
order
to
stupefy
them
and
render
them
insensible
to
their
sufferings
while
æmilius
was
affixing
a
sponge
dipped
in
this
vessel
of
vinegar
upon
a
reed
split
at
the
end
to
hold
it
firmly
ishmerai
the
robber
who
all
the
while
as
he
hung
had
uttered
execrations
upon
his
crucifiers
and
upon
pilate
called
howling
fiercely
to
jesus
if
thou
be
the
son
of
god
save
thyself
and
us
if
thou
didst
raise
a
man
once
from
the
dead
thou
canst
surely
keep
us
from
dying
thou
art
a
vile
wretch
if
thou
hast
power
as
a
prophet
and
will
not
use
it
for
me
when
thou
seest
how
heavy
i
am
of
body
and
how
my
great
weight
tortures
me
with
infernal
racking
and
rending
of
every
joint
but
omri
rebuking
his
fellow
said
dost
thou
not
fear
god
seeing
thou
art
in
the
same
condemnation
we
suffer
justly
for
our
crimes
and
do
receive
the
due
reward
of
our
transgressions
but
this
young
man
hath
done
nothing
amiss
save
to
preach
against
the
wickedness
of
the
priests
and
for
being
holier
than
they
lord
i
believe
that
thou
art
the
son
of
god
none
but
the
christ
could
do
the
works
that
thou
hast
done
or
suffer
patiently
as
thou
art
doing
lord
remember
me
when
thou
comest
into
thy
kingdom
jesus
turned
his
bleeding
head
towards
him
and
with
a
smile
of
ineffable
glory
radiating
his
pale
face
said
verily
i
say
unto
thee
this
day
shalt
thou
be
with
me
in
paradise
omri
upon
this
looked
inexpressibly
happy
and
seemed
to
rise
superior
to
his
sufferings
the
other
cursed
the
prophet
aloud
and
gnashed
at
him
with
his
teeth
with
looks
of
demoniacal
hatred
at
this
moment
æmilius
came
near
with
his
dripping
sponge
and
presented
the
reed
upwards
to
the
parched
lips
of
the
suffering
jesus
when
he
tasted
it
he
would
not
drink
for
he
perceived
it
was
the
opiate
which
was
usually
administered
in
compassion
to
shorten
the
anguish
of
the
crucified
the
robber
ishmerai
now
eagerly
cried
for
the
oblivious
sponge
and
the
prefect
giving
the
reed
to
a
soldier
the
latter
placed
it
to
the
mouth
of
the
robber
whose
swollen
tongue
protruded
he
drank
of
it
with
a
sort
of
mad
thirst
the
other
man
also
gladly
assuaged
his
burning
fever
with
it
and
soon
afterwards
both
of
them
sunk
into
insensibility
all
at
once
just
as
the
sixth
hour
was
sounded
from
the
temple
by
the
trumpets
of
the
levites
the
cloud
which
formed
by
the
smoke
of
the
numerous
sacrifices
had
hung
all
day
above
the
temple
was
seen
to
become
suddenly
of
inky
blackness
and
to
advance
towards
calvary
spreading
and
expanding
in
the
most
appalling
manner
as
it
approached
us
and
in
a
few
minutes
not
only
all
jerusalem
but
calvary
the
valley
of
kedron
the
mount
of
olives
and
all
the
country
were
involved
in
its
fearful
darkness
the
sun
which
had
before
been
shining
with
noonday
brilliancy
became
black
as
sackcloth
of
hair
and
a
dreadful
unearthly
indescribable
night
overshadowed
the
world
out
of
the
center
of
the
cloud
above
the
crosses
shot
forth
angry
lightnings
in
every
direction
but
there
was
no
thunder
attending
it
only
a
dead
sepulchral
suffocating
silence
of
the
thousands
who
had
been
gazing
upon
the
crucifixion
every
one
was
now
fallen
prostrate
upon
the
earth
in
terror
jerusalem
was
blotted
out
from
our
view
only
an
angry
spot
of
light
as
it
were
the
terrible
eye
of
god
itself
was
visible
above
the
temple
over
the
place
of
the
holy
of
holies
the
crosses
were
no
longer
visible
save
by
the
fearful
shine
of
the
lightnings
flashing
fiercely
from
the
dread
and
silent
cloud
the
form
of
jesus
amid
the
universal
gloom
shone
as
if
divinely
transfigured
and
a
soft
halo
of
celestial
light
encircled
his
brow
like
a
crown
of
glory
while
the
dark
bodies
of
the
two
robbers
could
scarcely
be
discerned
save
by
the
faint
radiance
emanating
from
his
own
men
talked
to
each
other
in
whispers
an
indefinable
dread
was
upon
each
mind
for
the
sudden
overspreading
of
the
darkness
was
as
unaccountable
as
it
was
frightful
mary
his
mother
and
lazarus
exclaimed
with
awe
both
speaking
together
this
is
his
power
he
has
produced
this
miracle
and
we
shall
behold
him
next
descend
from
the
cross
cried
rabbi
amos
let
us
take
courage
three
hours
three
long
and
awful
hours
this
supernatural
light
continued
and
all
that
while
the
vast
multitude
remained
fixed
and
moaning
waiting
they
knew
not
what
at
length
the
cloud
parted
above
the
cross
with
a
loud
peal
of
thunder
while
a
shower
of
terrible
lightning
fell
like
lances
of
fire
all
around
the
form
of
jesus
which
immediately
lost
its
halo
and
its
translucent
radiance
his
face
at
the
same
time
became
expressive
of
the
most
intense
sorrow
of
soul
a
hundred
voices
exclaimed
with
horror
see
he
is
deserted
and
punished
by
the
almighty
we
ourselves
were
amazed
and
appalled
our
rising
hopes
were
blasted
by
the
livid
lightnings
which
seemed
to
blast
him
heaven
as
well
as
man
seemed
to
war
against
him
his
mother
gave
utterance
to
a
groan
of
agony
and
sank
upon
the
ground
satisfied
that
her
son
was
truly
accursed
of
god
at
this
moment
as
if
to
confirm
all
our
fears
he
cried
in
the
hebrew
tongue
eloi
eloi
my
god
my
god
why
hast
thou
forsaken
me
upon
this
some
pitying
his
sufferings
ran
to
give
him
wine
and
hyssop
to
deaden
them
nay
let
him
live
let
us
see
if
elias
will
save
him
answered
abner
he
calleth
for
elisha
the
prophet
suddenly
the
darkness
which
had
filled
all
the
air
seemed
now
to
concentrate
and
gather
about
the
cross
so
that
he
who
hanged
thereon
became
invisible
from
the
midst
of
it
his
thrilling
voice
was
once
more
heard
as
clear
and
strong
as
it
rang
over
the
waters
of
galilee
when
he
preached
from
a
boat
to
the
thousands
thronging
the
shore
it
is
finished
father
into
thy
hands
i
commend
my
spirit
as
he
uttered
these
words
a
supernatural
glory
shone
around
him
and
with
a
deep
sigh
he
bowed
his
head
upon
his
breast
and
gave
up
the
ghost
the
general
exclamation
of
surprise
that
followed
these
clear
was
suddenly
checked
by
a
terrible
trembling
of
the
earth
beneath
our
feet
so
that
vast
numbers
of
people
were
cast
down
the
rocks
of
calvary
were
rent
and
thrown
upwards
while
the
whole
city
shook
with
the
convulsive
throes
of
an
earthquake
the
temple
seemed
on
fire
and
above
its
pinnacle
appeared
a
flaming
sword
which
seemed
to
us
to
cleave
the
walls
to
their
foundations
and
while
we
looked
the
sword
changed
into
the
shape
of
a
cross
of
dazzling
light
standing
high
in
the
air
over
the
altar
and
from
its
golden
beams
poured
rays
so
bright
that
all
jerusalem
and
the
hill
country
for
a
wide
extent
became
as
light
as
the
ground
still
continued
to
rock
and
the
sepulchres
of
the
kings
with
the
tombs
of
ancient
prophets
were
riven
by
vast
chasms
and
the
green
earth
was
strewn
with
the
bones
and
bodies
of
the
dead
the
dark
cloud
which
had
begun
to
form
first
with
the
smoke
of
the
sacrifices
of
the
temple
was
now
dissipated
by
the
light
of
the
fiery
cross
and
the
sun
reappeared
before
it
the
glorious
vision
over
the
temple
gradually
faded
out
and
disappeared
the
natural
order
of
things
gradually
returned
and
men
smiting
their
breasts
began
to
move
towards
the
city
filled
with
awe
and
dread
at
what
they
had
witnessed
the
centurion
who
stood
watching
these
fearful
things
said
aloud
to
æmilius
this
man
spake
the
truth
he
was
a
god
truly
responded
æmilius
this
was
none
other
than
the
son
of
god
the
very
christ
of
the
jewish
prophets
all
things
in
the
air
and
on
the
earth
sympathize
with
his
death
as
if
the
god
of
nature
had
expired
sad
and
weeping
we
left
the
dismal
scene
hanging
our
heads
in
despondency
having
even
while
wondering
at
these
mighty
events
connected
with
his
crucifixion
abandoned
forever
all
hope
that
this
was
he
who
should
have
redeemed
our
nation
and
restored
the
royal
splendor
of
judah
and
the
throne
of
the
house
of
david

letter
xxxvi
third
morning
after
the
my
dear
father
on
the
day
on
which
the
wonderful
events
took
place
which
i
have
detailed
at
large
in
my
last
letter
the
chief
priests
at
the
head
of
whom
was
annas
met
pilate
as
he
was
riding
forth
from
the
city
attended
by
a
score
of
to
survey
the
deep
rents
made
by
the
earthquake
and
to
hear
from
the
mouths
of
all
the
people
the
particulars
of
the
marvels
which
attended
the
crucifixion
of
jesus
when
they
came
near
him
they
besought
him
that
he
would
command
his
soldiers
to
take
down
the
bodies
as
the
next
day
was
a
and
that
it
was
contrary
to
their
customs
to
have
criminals
executed
or
left
hanging
on
that
day
what
think
ye
demanded
pilate
reining
up
and
soothing
his
syrian
which
startled
at
the
dead
bodies
that
lay
near
for
they
were
crossing
the
place
of
the
opened
tombs
had
for
some
time
tramped
and
plunged
madly
what
think
ye
priests
have
ye
crucified
a
man
or
a
god
we
think
these
mighty
wonders
tell
us
that
he
was
more
than
a
man
the
priests
looked
troubled
and
seemed
unable
to
answer
but
terah
chief
priest
of
the
house
of
mariah
answered
and
said
my
lord
these
were
wonderful
phenomena
but
they
would
have
happened
if
this
nazarene
had
not
died
here
is
a
famous
astrologer
from
arabia
who
studies
the
skies
who
says
that
this
darkness
was
caused
by
an
eclipse
of
the
sun
the
dark
cloud
was
but
the
smoke
of
the
sacrifices
while
the
earthquake
was
but
a
natural
and
usual
occurrence
stay
sir
priest
answered
pilate
we
at
rome
though
called
barbarians
by
you
polished
jews
have
some
scholarship
in
astrology
we
know
well
that
an
eclipse
of
the
sun
can
take
place
only
when
the
moon
is
new
it
is
on
this
eve
of
the
at
its
full
and
will
rise
nearly
opposite
the
sun
it
was
no
eclipse
sir
priest
and
thy
arabian
is
a
false
astrologer
these
events
occurred
because
that
divine
man
your
king
has
been
executed
thus
speaking
the
roman
procurator
spurred
on
towards
the
place
followed
by
his
now
avoiding
an
open
grave
now
leaping
one
of
the
freshly
opened
chasms
now
turning
aside
from
some
body
cast
up
by
the
earthquake
when
he
came
in
front
of
the
crosses
he
saw
that
jesus
hung
as
if
dead
while
the
thieves
still
breathed
and
from
time
to
time
heaved
groans
of
anguish
although
partly
insensible
from
the
effects
of
the
opiate
which
had
been
administered
to
them
think
you
romulus
that
he
has
any
life
in
him
asked
pilate
in
a
subdued
tone
of
voice
gazing
sorrowfully
and
with
looks
of
upon
the
drooping
form
of
his
victim
he
is
dead
an
hour
ago
answered
the
centurion
he
expired
when
the
earthquake
shook
the
city
and
the
flaming
sword
was
unsheathed
in
the
air
above
the
temple
it
was
a
fearful
sight
sir
and
the
more
wonderful
to
see
it
change
in
the
shape
of
a
cross
of
fire
i
fear
sir
we
have
crucified
one
of
the
gods
in
the
shape
of
a
man
it
would
appear
so
centurion
answered
pilate
shaking
his
head
i
would
it
had
not
been
done
but
is
past
the
jews
desire
their
bodies
to
be
removed
before
their
great
sabbath
let
them
have
their
desire
pilate
then
turned
his
horse
and
rode
slowly
and
sadly
away
from
the
spot
romulus
gave
orders
to
his
soldiers
to
remove
the
bodies
when
the
soldiers
came
to
jesus
they
saw
that
he
was
already
dead
let
us
not
break
his
legs
said
one
to
the
other
it
were
sacrilege
to
mar
such
a
manly
form
yet
we
must
insure
his
death
ere
he
can
be
taken
away
responded
the
other
i
will
pierce
him
to
make
sure
thus
speaking
the
soldier
directed
his
spear
to
the
side
of
jesus
and
cleaved
the
flesh
to
his
heart
john
who
stood
near
and
saw
and
heard
all
upon
seeing
this
done
bowed
his
head
to
the
earth
in
total
abandonment
of
hope
when
he
raised
his
head
to
gaze
upon
his
crucified
master
he
saw
flowing
from
the
rent
in
his
side
two
fountains
together
one
of
crimson
blood
and
lo
the
other
of
crystal
water
he
could
not
believe
what
he
saw
until
the
soldiers
and
the
centurion
expressed
aloud
their
wonder
at
such
a
marvel
never
was
such
a
man
crucified
before
exclaimed
the
centurion
in
the
meanwhile
rabbi
joseph
the
counsellor
of
arimathea
who
stands
high
in
favor
with
pilate
met
the
governor
as
he
was
skirting
the
wall
of
the
city
with
his
cohort
and
asked
him
if
after
jesus
should
be
pronounced
dead
he
might
take
down
the
body
and
give
it
sepulchre
go
and
receive
the
body
of
this
wonderful
man
said
pilate
methinks
thou
art
one
who
knew
him
well
what
thinkest
thou
of
him
rabbi
joseph
perceived
that
pilate
asked
the
question
with
deep
interest
seemingly
very
greatly
troubled
in
mind
and
he
answered
him
boldly
i
believe
that
he
was
a
prophet
sent
from
god
your
excellency
and
that
has
died
on
calvary
the
most
virtuous
the
wisest
and
the
most
innocent
man
in
cæsar
empire
my
conscience
echoes
your
words
answered
pilate
gloomily
and
putting
spurs
to
his
horse
he
galloped
forward
in
the
direction
of
the
gethsemane
gardens
proceeding
to
the
cross
joseph
by
the
aid
of
lazarus
simon
peter
mary
martha
and
rabbi
amos
took
it
out
of
the
socket
in
the
rock
with
its
precious
burden
and
gently
laid
it
upon
the
ground
with
the
body
still
extended
upon
it
in
the
still
holy
twilight
of
that
dread
day
the
west
all
shadowy
gold
and
mellow
light
the
air
asleep
and
a
sacred
silence
reigning
in
heaven
and
on
earth
they
bore
away
from
the
hill
of
death
the
body
of
the
dead
prophet
the
shoulders
of
nicodemus
of
peter
of
lazarus
and
of
john
gently
sustained
the
loving
weight
of
him
they
once
honored
above
all
men
and
whom
though
proved
by
his
death
as
they
believed
to
have
fatally
deceived
himself
as
to
his
divine
mission
as
the
christ
they
still
loved
for
his
sorrows
so
patiently
borne
for
his
virtues
so
vividly
remembered
slowly
the
little
group
wound
their
way
along
the
rocky
surface
of
golgotha
the
last
to
leave
that
fearful
place
in
the
coming
darkness
their
measured
tread
their
low
whispers
the
subdued
wail
of
the
women
who
followed
the
rude
bier
of
branches
the
lonely
path
they
trod
all
combined
to
render
the
spectacle
one
of
touching
solemnity
the
shades
of
evening
were
gathering
thick
around
them
they
took
secret
ways
for
fear
of
the
jews
but
some
that
met
them
turned
aside
with
awe
when
they
knew
what
corpse
was
borne
along
for
the
impression
of
the
appalling
scenes
of
the
day
had
not
yet
wholly
passed
away
from
their
minds
at
length
they
reached
a
gate
in
the
wall
of
the
garden
attached
to
the
noble
abode
of
the
wealthy
rabbi
joseph
who
went
before
and
with
a
key
unlocked
it
and
admitted
them
into
the
secluded
enclosure
here
the
thickness
of
the
foliage
of
olive
and
fig
trees
created
complete
darkness
for
by
this
time
the
evening
star
was
burning
like
a
lamp
in
the
roseate
west
they
rested
the
bier
upon
the
pavement
beneath
the
arch
and
awaited
in
silence
and
darkness
the
appearance
of
torches
which
rabbi
joseph
had
sent
for
to
his
house
the
servants
bearing
them
were
soon
seen
advancing
the
flickering
light
from
the
flambeaux
giving
all
things
visible
by
it
a
wild
aspect
in
keeping
with
the
hour
follow
me
said
joseph
in
a
low
voice
that
was
full
charged
with
deep
sorrow
as
the
servants
preceded
him
with
their
torches
the
sad
bearers
of
the
dead
body
of
jesus
raised
their
sacred
burden
from
the
ground
and
trod
onward
their
measured
echoing
among
the
aisles
of
the
garden
at
its
farther
extremity
where
the
rock
hangs
beetling
over
the
valley
and
forms
at
this
place
the
wall
of
the
garden
was
a
shallow
flight
of
stone
steps
leading
to
a
new
tomb
hewn
out
of
the
rock
it
had
been
constructed
for
the
rabbi
himself
and
had
just
been
completed
and
in
it
no
man
had
ever
been
laid
the
servants
by
command
of
joseph
rolled
back
the
stone
and
exposed
the
dark
vault
of
the
gaping
sepulchre
how
is
it
most
worthy
rabbi
said
a
roman
centurion
suddenly
apprizing
them
of
his
presence
by
his
voice
that
you
bury
thus
with
honor
a
man
who
has
proved
himself
unable
to
keep
the
dazzling
promises
he
has
allured
so
many
of
you
with
all
present
turned
with
surprise
at
seeing
not
only
the
centurion
but
half
a
score
of
on
whose
helmets
and
cuirasses
the
torches
brightly
gleamed
marching
across
the
grass
towards
the
spot
what
means
this
intrusion
roman
asked
rabbi
joseph
i
am
sent
hither
by
command
of
the
procurator
answered
the
centurion
the
chief
jews
have
had
an
interview
with
him
informing
him
that
the
man
whom
he
had
crucified
had
foretold
that
after
three
days
he
would
rise
again
they
therefore
asked
a
guard
to
be
given
them
to
place
over
the
sepulchre
till
the
third
day
lest
his
disciples
secretly
withdraw
the
body
and
report
that
their
master
is
risen
pilate
therefore
has
commanded
me
to
keep
watch
with
my
men
we
bury
him
with
this
deference
and
respect
centurion
answered
rabbi
joseph
because
we
believe
him
to
have
been
deceived
not
a
deceiver
he
was
gifted
by
god
with
vast
power
and
therefore
doubtless
believed
he
could
do
all
things
he
was
too
holy
wise
and
good
to
deceive
he
has
fallen
a
victim
to
his
own
wishes
for
the
weal
of
israel
which
were
impossible
by
man
to
be
realized
the
body
of
jesus
wrapped
in
its
shroud
of
spotless
linen
and
surrounded
by
the
preserving
spices
of
arabia
was
then
borne
into
the
tomb
and
laid
reverently
upon
the
table
of
stone
which
joseph
had
prepared
for
his
own
last
simon
peter
was
the
last
to
quit
the
side
of
the
body
by
which
he
knelt
as
if
he
would
never
leave
it
shedding
all
the
while
great
tears
of
bitter
grief
john
only
at
last
drawing
him
gently
forth
enabled
the
centurion
and
soldiers
to
close
the
heavy
door
of
the
tomb
having
secured
it
evenly
by
revolving
it
in
its
socket
the
of
the
procurator
who
had
come
with
the
soldiers
placed
a
mass
of
wax
melted
by
a
torch
upon
each
side
of
it
over
the
crevices
and
stamped
each
with
the
imperial
signet
which
to
break
is
death
the
jews
who
were
present
seeing
that
the
sepulchre
was
thus
made
sure
by
the
sealing
of
the
stone
and
by
the
setting
of
the
vigilant
roman
watch
of
eighteen
men
took
their
departure
rabbi
joseph
nicodemus
and
the
rest
of
the
friends
of
jesus
then
slowly
retired
leaving
a
sentinel
pacing
to
and
fro
before
the
tomb
and
others
grouped
about
beneath
the
trees
or
on
the
steps
of
the
sepulchre
playing
at
their
favorite
game
of
dice
or
gazing
upon
the
broad
moon
conversing
or
singing
their
native
italian
airs
yet
with
their
arms
at
hand
ready
to
spring
to
their
feet
at
the
least
alarm
or
word
of
alert
something
fearful
must
this
instant
have
happened
for
the
house
has
just
shaken
as
if
with
an
earthquake
what
can
be
the
meaning
of
these
wonders
this
morning
mary
and
martha
with
others
have
gone
to
visit
tomb
in
joseph
garden
as
i
have
already
said
for
the
purpose
of
embalming
the
body
and
on
their
return
we
are
to
go
to
bethany
for
a
few
days
until
the
violent
hostility
of
the
jews
to
his
followers
subsides
i
hear
now
the
voices
of
mary
and
martha
in
the
court
of
the
street
returning
from
the
tomb
they
are
pitched
to
a
wild
note
of
joy
what
can
mean
the
commotion
the
exclamations
the
running
and
shouting
all
through
the
corridors
and
court
i
must
close
and
fly
to
learn
what
new
terror
or
wonder
has
occurred
in
haste
your
affectionate
daughter
adina
letter
xxxvii
first
day
of
the
my
dear
father

shall
i
make
known
to
you

words

marvelous
joyous

and
most
wonderful
news
which
i
have
to
tell

with
rapture
while
a
sense
of
profound
awe
impresses
all
my
soul
jesus
is
alive
jesus
has
risen
from
the
dead
jesus
has
proved
himself
to
be
the
son
of
god
i
can
scarcely
hold
my
pen
for
joy
and
wonder
or
collect
my
thoughts
for
very
amazement
at
what
has
transpired
upon
hearing
my
name
called
by
mary
and
others
in
eager
tones
i
hastened
to
go
down
on
reaching
the
staircase
i
met
my
cousin
ascending
almost
flying
wonder
love
and
happiness
inexpressible
beamed
from
her
beautiful
countenance
meeting
me
she
threw
her
arms
about
my
neck
and
essayed
to
utter
something
but
her
heart
was
too
full
and
bursting
into
sobs
she
wept
convulsively
upon
my
bosom
in
an
ecstasy
of
delirious
joy
amazed
and
confounded
not
knowing
what
had
happened
i
held
her
to
my
heart
and
tried
to
soothe
her
emotion
what
oh
what
hath
happened
speak
dear
mary
i
asked
unable
to
wait
longer
in
suspense
she
raised
her
head
and
through
her
tears
and
smiles
at
length
said
brokenly
he
he
is
risen
oh
he
is
risen
from
the
tomb
who
i
cried
half
believing
yet
doubting
the
lord
our
mighty
master
jesus
the
very
son
of
god
the
blessed
he
is
alive
adina
come
delay
not
i
have
flown
into
the
city
to
tell
thee
and
mary
has
told
peter
and
john
whom
she
met
at
the
door
and
who
doubting
as
thou
hast
done
have
run
to
see
if
these
things
be
so
they
will
find
the
sepulchre
empty
haste
to
go
with
us
while
overwhelmed
with
wonder
and
trembling
with
joy
i
was
preparing
to
accompany
her
martha
appeared
her
face
radiant
with
celestial
happiness
you
have
heard
the
tidings
of
great
joy
o
adina
can
they
be
true
martha
i
asked
earnestly
yes
for
i
have
seen
him
walking
heard
his
voice
and
touched
him
you
also
shall
see
him
for
he
hath
sent
us
to
tell
his
disciples
i
wept
for
joy
at
the
gateway
we
met
mary
of
bethany
and
we
three
now
hastened
together
towards
the
garden
of
joseph
i
wishing
my
feet
wings
that
i
might
reach
the
sepulchre
sooner
fearing
that
the
vision
of
jesus
would
be
vanished
ere
i
arrived
as
we
were
going
out
of
the
gate
we
were
met
by
four
or
five
roman
soldiers
who
with
aspects
stamped
with
fear
were
running
past
us
into
the
city
what
means
this
flight
and
terror
men
cried
the
captain
of
the
gate
you
fly
as
if
you
were
in
full
retreat
from
an
enemy
speak
marius
you
seem
to
have
your
senses
he
demanded
of
the
youngest
of
the
soldiers
an
officer
under
a
centurion
we
paused
to
hear
what
he
said
per
dian
captain
we
have
been
terrified
beyond
measure
answered
the
soldier
my
heart
beats
yet
as
if
it
were
an
you
see
we
were
a
part
of
the
guard
left
in
charge
of
the
sepulchre
of
this
jewish
prophet
crucified
three
days
ago
before
dawn
this
morning
as
i
was
pacing
to
and
fro
before
the
tomb
there
suddenly
shone
round
about
us
a
light
like
a
descending
meteor
accompanied
by
a
rushing
as
if
of
a
legion
of
wings
the
men
started
to
their
feet
in
amazement
on
looking
about
us
i
saw
a
dazzling
form
in
the
with
broad
wings
of
gold
sparkling
with
myriads
of
stars
every
feather
a
star
and
clad
in
raiment
white
and
gleaming
as
the
summer
lightning
this
terrible
presence
like
that
of
one
of
the
dii
immortales
made
us
fear
exceedingly
beyond
any
terror
we
had
before
experienced
but
when
we
saw
this
mighty
being
descend
straight
towards
the
tomb
and
beheld
the
resplendent
majesty
of
his
celestial
visage
which
blinded
us
our
hearts
failed
within
us
the
angel
or
god
alighted
amid
a
blaze
of
radiance
at
the
door
of
the
sepulchre
and
as
his
foot
touched
the
earth
it
trembled
as
if
with
a
great
earthquake
the
soldiers
shook
with
terror
and
fell
to
the
ground
before
his
presence
as
dead
men
i
stood
unable
to
move
frozen
by
fear
to
a
statue
he
touched
the
great
stone
door
with
one
of
his
fingers
and
it
rolled
outward
at
his
feet
as
if
a
catapult
had
struck
it
and
like
jove
taking
his
throne
he
sat
upon
it
but
one
thing
more
continued
the
soldier
was
wanting
to
fill
my
cup
of
terror
to
the
full
and
it
followed
i
saw
the
crucified
prophet
rise
up
from
the
slab
on
which
he
was
laid
and
stand
upon
his
feet
and
walk
forth
alive
with
the
tread
of
some
mighty
conqueror
the
celestial
being
so
terrible
in
his
majestic
splendor
veiled
his
face
with
his
wings
before
his
presence
and
prostrated
himself
at
his
feet
as
if
in
homage
to
one
greater
than
himself
i
saw
no
more
but
fell
insensible
with
terror
to
the
earth
when
at
length
i
came
to
myself
the
tomb
was
filled
with
dazzling
forms
of
resplendent
beauty
the
air
rang
with
music
such
as
mortals
never
before
heard
and
i
fled
pursued
by
my
fears
the
rest
of
the
soldiers
rising
and
following
me
each
man
fearing
to
look
back
but
bewildered
we
lost
our
way
the
soldiers
hurried
forward
into
the
city
while
confirmed
now
in
the
certainty
that
jesus
was
risen
i
hastened
with
martha
and
mary
in
the
direction
of
the
garden
how
and
where
did
you
behold
him
mary
i
interrogated
as
we
drew
near
to
the
steep
path
leading
to
the
gate
of
joseph
garden
when
we
reached
the
tomb
with
our
spices
and
precious
ointments
to
embalm
the
body
we
found
it
open
and
the
soldiers
who
had
guarded
it
lying
about
upon
the
ground
like
dead
men
upon
the
stone
sat
the
archangel
but
the
resplendent
light
of
his
apparel
and
countenance
was
so
tempered
to
our
eyes
that
although
we
believed
it
was
an
angel
we
were
not
terrified
for
his
looks
were
serene
and
the
aspect
of
his
face
divinely
beautiful
combined
with
a
terrible
and
indescribable
majesty
we
shook
with
fear
and
stood
still
unable
to
move
gazing
on
him
in
silent
expectation
not
said
he
in
a
voice
that
seemed
to
fill
the
air
about
us
with
undulating
music
not
daughters
of
abraham
i
know
that
ye
seek
jesus
which
was
crucified
he
is
not
here
but
is
risen
as
he
foretold
lo
see
the
place
where
the
lord
of
life
and
conqueror
of
death
hath
lain
we
then
timidly
approached
and
looked
in
and
saw
the
sepulchre
empty
but
a
soft
light
filled
the
whole
place
and
tell
his
disciples
that
the
lord
is
risen
added
the
angel
that
he
will
go
before
them
into
galilee
there
shall
they
see
him
not
many
days
hence
when
the
angel
had
thus
spoken
to
us
continued
mary
we
departed
quickly
from
the
sepulchre
with
fear
and
great
joy
and
ran
to
go
into
the
city
to
bring
his
disciples
word
according
to
the
command
of
the
angel
but
i
had
not
advanced
so
far
as
the
gate
of
the
garden
being
behind
the
rest
when
i
beheld
jesus
himself
standing
in
my
path
i
stopped
between
terror
and
joy
hail
daughter
of
israel
he
said
not
afraid
i
am
living
that
was
dead
go
mary
and
tell
my
mother
and
my
brethren
and
peter
and
john
and
lazarus
that
i
am
risen
and
that
i
have
spoken
with
you
be
not
afraid
i
am
the
resurrection
and
the
life
i
then
cast
myself
at
his
feet
and
worshiped
him
with
awe
and
when
i
looked
up
he
was
gone
the
others
did
not
see
him
we
now
continued
on
to
the
city
as
if
we
had
wings
but
see
we
are
now
at
the
gate
of
the
garden
added
mary
of
bethany
in
a
low
tone
of
awe
he
must
be
near
us
but
we
approached
the
tomb
without
seeing
any
man
having
arrived
before
peter
and
john
who
had
been
delayed
some
time
at
the
jaffa
gate
we
therefore
found
no
one
at
the
sepulchre
it
was
open
and
empty
the
stone
in
front
on
which
the
archangel
sat
was
vacant
as
we
drew
near
a
bright
light
suddenly
shone
out
from
the
tomb
and
upon
going
higher
i
beheld
two
angels
clothed
in
white
robes
and
with
countenances
of
divine
radiance
seated
one
at
the
head
and
the
other
at
the
foot
of
the
slab
of
marble
on
which
the
body
of
jesus
had
lain
be
not
afraid
daughters
of
jerusalem
said
one
of
the
angels
speaking
to
us
in
the
hebrew
tongue
he
whom
ye
seek
liveth
he
is
risen
from
the
tomb
which
could
not
hold
him
but
through
his
consent
for
jesus
is
lord
of
life
and
victor
over
death
and
hell
for
evermore
go
your
way
and
tell
his
disciples
that
he
awaits
them
by
the
seaside
the
angels
then
vanished
from
our
sight
and
at
the
same
moment
john
and
peter
came
running
and
seeing
the
stone
rolled
away
john
stooped
down
and
looked
in
and
said
that
he
saw
the
linen
clothes
in
which
the
body
of
jesus
had
been
wrapped
lying
folded
together
and
also
the
napkin
which
had
been
bound
about
his
head
peter
now
coming
up
breathless
with
eagerness
and
haste
no
sooner
saw
the
tomb
open
than
he
went
boldly
in
and
carefully
examined
all
for
himself
when
we
made
known
to
them
what
the
angels
had
said
to
us
that
jesus
would
go
before
and
meet
them
in
galilee
they
rejoiced
greatly
and
shortly
afterwards
departed
to
hasten
into
galilee
i
also
returned
with
them
to
convey
the
news
to
mary
the
mother
of
jesus
who
had
scarcely
left
her
couch
in
her
great
sorrow
since
the
day
of
the
crucifixion
mary
of
bethany
however
remained
lingering
near
the
tomb
hoping
that
jesus
had
not
yet
left
the
garden
and
that
she
might
once
more
behold
him
seated
upon
the
steps
of
the
tomb
weeping
for
joy
at
his
resurrection
and
wishing
once
more
to
behold
him
she
heard
a
footstep
behind
her
and
turning
round
saw
a
man
standing
near
her
it
was
jesus
himself
and
kneeling
she
was
about
to
clasp
his
feet
when
he
said
to
her
touch
me
not
mary
i
am
not
yet
ascended
to
my
father
but
go
and
tell
lazarus
and
my
brethren
and
my
mother
that
i
ascend
ere
many
days
unto
my
father
and
your
father
and
unto
my
god
and
your
god
jesus
then
vanished
out
of
her
sight
and
she
came
and
told
all
these
things
to
us
and
to
the
disciples
but
what
pen
can
describe
my
dear
father
the
amazement
and
consternation
of
caiaphas
and
the
chief
priests
and
the
rest
of
his
enemies
caiaphas
hearing
the
uproar
of
the
soldiers
sprang
from
his
couch
to
inquire
the
cause
and
on
being
assured
by
his
servants
that
jesus
had
burst
his
tomb
and
risen
alive
from
the
dead
he
quaked
and
became
deadly
pale
when
pilate
received
the
account
from
the
centurion
of
the
guard
he
said
we
have
crucified
a
god
as
i
believed
henceforth
i
am
accursed
and
leaving
his
hall
of
judgment
he
went
and
shut
himself
up
in
his
own
room
which
he
has
not
since
left
caiaphas
and
the
chief
priests
and
scribes
in
the
meanwhile
assembled
together
in
full
sanhedrim
and
hearing
the
testimony
of
the
centurion
were
convinced
that
the
fact
could
not
be
concealed
of
resurrection
who
has
seen
him
alive
demanded
the
high
priest
i
have
seen
him
my
lord
answered
the
centurion
i
saw
his
pierced
feet
and
hands
as
he
walked
past
me
and
the
morning
breeze
blew
aside
his
mantle
and
exposed
to
my
eyes
the
open
wound
made
by
the
spear
of
my
soldier
philippus
he
was
alive
and
in
full
strength
of
limb
thou
sawest
a
vision
roman
answered
caiaphas
come
aside
with
us
and
let
us
talk
with
thee
in
a
few
minutes
afterwards
the
centurion
left
the
court
of
the
high
priest
palace
followed
by
a
gibeonite
slave
bearing
after
him
a
vase
of
persian
gold
he
has
told
every
one
since
that
he
must
have
seen
a
spirit
for
the
disciples
of
jesus
came
by
night
and
stole
away
the
body
of
their
master
while
they
slept
overcome
with
watching
his
soldiers
have
also
been
bribed
to
tell
the
same
tale
such
is
the
false
version
that
now
goes
about
the
city
my
dear
father
but
there
are
few
that
give
it
credence
even
of
our
enemies
as
æmilius
who
is
filled
with
great
joy
at
the
resurrection
of
jesus
very
justly
says
if
these
soldiers
slept
on
guard
they
merited
death
therefor
by
the
military
laws
of
the
empire
if
while
sleeping
their
charge
the
dead
body
of
jesus
was
taken
away
they
deserve
death
for
failing
to
prevent
it
why
then
are
they
not
placed
under
arrest
by
orders
if
this
story
be
true
because
pilate
well
knows
that
it
is
not
true
he
knows
because
he
has
privately
examined
many
of
the
soldiers
that
jesus
did
burst
his
tomb
and
that
angels
rolled
away
the
stone
without
breaking
his
seals
which
could
not
have
been
left
unmarred
but
by
a
miracle
he
knows
that
jesus
has
arisen
for
it
is
believed
that
he
has
also
beheld
him
at
least
such
is
the
rumor
at
the
pretorium
it
was
the
form
of
jesus
visible
before
him
doubtless
that
drove
him
in
such
amazement
from
his
hall
to
his
secret
chamber
for
it
was
remarked
that
he
started
turned
deadly
pale
and
essayed
to
address
the
invisible
space
before
him
as
if
he
saw
a
spirit
besides
the
facts
which
i
have
stated
is
the
increasing
testimony
of
the
thousands
who
have
gone
out
of
the
city
to
see
the
sepulchre
where
he
was
laid
they
say
both
enemies
of
jesus
as
well
as
our
friends
that
it
was
impossible
for
the
door
to
have
been
opened
by
any
human
being
not
by
pilate
himself
without
marring
the
seals
they
also
assert
that
to
remove
the
stone
by
night
which
would
require
four
men
and
to
bear
forth
the
body
would
have
been
impossible
if
the
guard
had
been
present
and
if
they
had
been
asleep
they
must
have
been
awakened
with
the
heavy
noise
made
by
rolling
the
massive
door
along
the
hollow
pavement
outside
the
sepulchre
if
say
the
common
people
the
watch
slept
why
does
not
the
procurator
put
them
to
death
this
question
remains
unanswered
and
the
watch
go
about
the
streets
unharmed
my
dear
father
remember
no
more
my
unbelief
but
with
me
believe
in
jesus
that
he
is
the
son
of
god
the
savior
of
israel
the
immortal
christ
of
the
prophets
your
affectionate

letter
xxxviii
house
of
mary
and
martha
a
month
after
the
i
deeply
regret
my
dearest
father
the
delays
which
have
detained
you
so
long
from
arriving
at
jerusalem
but
trust
that
ere
many
days
the
caravan
for
which
you
wait
will
reach
gaza
and
that
you
will
be
enabled
to
resume
your
journey
to
the
holy
city
i
am
now
at
bethany
where
i
have
been
some
time
making
my
home
uncle
amos
has
retired
for
the
present
to
his
farm
near
jericho
but
will
be
here
to
remain
with
us
therefore
when
you
come
near
to
jerusalem
instead
of
going
directly
into
the
city
turn
aside
by
the
road
leading
past
the
king
gardens
and
go
up
the
brook
of
kedron
into
the
way
to
bethany
i
pray
that
god
may
preserve
you
in
safety
and
soon
permit
me
the
happiness
of
once
more
embracing
you
after
three
long
years
of
separation
and
what
events
have
transpired
in
these
three
years
once
more
my
dear
father
read
carefully
over
the
whole
narrative
and
answer
to
yourself
this
inquiry
is
not
this
man
the
son
of
god
is
not
he
the
very
christ
the
messias
isaias
prophesied
of
the
christ
whom
he
saw
afar
off
that
he
should
be
a
man
of
sorrows
that
he
should
be
despised
and
rejected
of
men
that
he
should
be
taken
from
prison
and
judgment
and
cut
off
from
the
land
of
the
living
that
he
should
be
numbered
with
the
wicked
in
his
death
and
make
his
grave
with
the
rich
how
light
how
clear
how
plain
all
these
prophecies
now
are
to
me
and
to
us
all
how
wonderfully
in
their
minuteness
they
have
been
fulfilled
you
already
know
his
resurrection
also
was
foretold
by
himself
but
we
did
not
understand
his
words
until
now
when
he
spoke
of
destroying
the
temple
and
raising
it
in
three
days
he
spoke
of
the
tabernacle
of
his
body
oh
how
many
sayings
which
when
spoken
by
his
sacred
lips
we
understood
not
now
rush
upon
us
in
all
their
meaning
proving
to
us
that
every
step
of
his
life
was
foreknown
to
him
that
he
went
forward
to
his
death
aware
of
all
things
whatsoever
that
were
going
to
befall
him
but
his
resurrection
was
also
foretold
by
the
holy
david
when
he
said
thou
wilt
not
leave
his
soul
in
hell
nor
suffer
thy
holy
one
to
see
corruption
and
his
arraignment
before
pilate
caiaphas
and
herod
was
foretold
by
david
when
he
said
the
kings
of
the
earth
set
themselves
and
the
rulers
take
counsel
together
against
the
lord
and
against
his
anointed
yet
the
lord
saith
thou
art
my
son
this
day
have
i
begotten
thee
also
my
dear
father
turn
to
the
psalms
of
king
david
and
compare
the
following
words
which
speak
of
messias
with
what
i
have
described
in
my
previous
letters
they
shoot
out
the
lip
at
me
they
shake
the
head
they
laugh
me
to
scorn
they
say
he
trusted
in
the
lord
that
he
would
deliver
him
thou
hast
brought
me
into
the
dust
of
death
read
the
same
psalm
of
the
holy
king
a
little
farther
and
you
will
see
these
words
which
were
put
by
the
royal
prophet
into
the
lips
of
his
future
messias
the
assembly
of
the
wicked
have
enclosed
me
they
pierced
my
hands
and
my
feet
they
part
my
garments
among
them
and
upon
my
vesture
cast
lots
read
and
compare
these
prophecies
of
messias
with
the
accounts
in
my
letters
dear
father
and
you
will
not
only
be
convinced
that
jesus
is
the
messias
but
you
will
perceive
that
his
humiliation
and
sufferings
before
pilate
and
caiaphas
his
agony
on
the
cross
his
death
and
burial
instead
as
we
ignorantly
conceived
of
being
evidences
that
he
was
not
the
christ
are
proof
that
he
was
the
very
son
of
the
highest
the
shiloh
of
jehovah
foretold
by
the
prophets
the
anointed
king
of
israel
oh
wonderful
is
all
this
how
marvelous
these
things
passing
before
our
eyes
now
all
is
dazzlingly
clear
the
prophets
are
unveiled
to
our
sight
and
we
see
that
these
things
must
have
happened
to
him
oh
our
darkness
our
blindness
to
have
seen
in
the
prophecies
of
messias
only
the
passages
which
speak
of
his
glory
and
power
read
the
prophets
no
longer
my
dearest
father
with
a
veil
before
your
eyes
see
in
all
you
read
jesus
as
the
end
of
the
prophets
the
goal
of
all
their
prophecies
the
veritable
and
sure
realization
of
their
prophetic
visions
thus
my
dear
father
has
jesus
in
all
particulars
proved
himself
to
be
the
subject
of
all
prophecy
the
king
of
israel
but
you
will
now
ask
is
he
to
the
throne
of
david
and
live
forever
yes
but
not
a
jerusalem
of
earthly
splendor
oh
how
clear
are
all
things
to
my
apprehension
now
the
jerusalem
in
which
his
throne
is
to
be
placed
is
heavenly
and
the
true
jerusalem
of
which
the
present
one
is
but
the
material
type
what
the
body
is
to
the
soul
of
man
jesus
has
talked
with
me
since
his
resurrection
and
explained
all
this
to
me
and
much
more
that
is
wonderful
and
full
of
joy
it
is
now
four
weeks
since
he
arose
and
in
that
time
he
has
been
not
only
seen
by
all
the
disciples
but
by
hundreds
of
his
followers
the
only
change
in
his
usual
appearance
dear
father
to
the
eye
is
a
transparent
paleness
which
gives
a
soft
radiance
to
his
whole
aspect
and
a
certain
majestic
reserve
which
awes
all
who
draw
near
to
him
so
that
men
speak
in
his
presence
in
subdued
whispers
his
mother
happiest
of
women
now
as
she
was
before
the
most
wretched
ever
sits
at
his
feet
and
silently
enjoys
his
sacred
presence
seldom
speaking
and
looking
up
to
him
rather
as
a
worshiper
to
her
god
than
a
mother
upon
her
son
that
he
is
in
the
flesh
in
reality
and
not
a
spirit
he
has
proven
to
his
disciples
by
eating
with
them
and
in
a
remarkable
way
to
an
incredulous
disciple
called
thomas
who
not
believing
that
jesus
was
risen
in
his
real
body
from
the
dead
was
told
by
the
divine
lord
to
place
his
fingers
into
his
hands
and
his
hand
into
his
side
which
thomas
convinced
with
awe
refused
to
do
but
falling
at
his
feet
in
amazement
and
adoration
worshiped
him
as
god
his
disciples
are
with
him
in
the
gardens
of
david
at
bethlehem
where
he
is
holding
daily
a
solemn
council
with
the
eleven
unfolding
to
them
the
glory
of
his
kingdom
and
opening
their
understandings
to
the
clear
apprehension
of
all
which
the
prophets
have
written
concerning
him
john
who
is
a
member
of
this
divine
council
says
that
the
power
of
jesus
the
extent
and
majesty
of
his
kingdom
the
infinite
results
of
his
death
and
resurrection
are
not
to
be
conceived
of
by
those
who
have
not
listened
to
these
sublime
revelations
of
his
own
lips
he
hath
shown
us
said
john
how
that
his
true
office
as
son
of
god
and
son
of
man
is
to
be
a
mediator
he
showed
us
that
he
himself
was
the
high
priest
and
how
that
the
cross
was
the
veritable
altar
of
this
great
world
sacrifice
and
its
temple
the
whole
earth
and
heavens
how
wonderful
dear
father
is
all
this
he
further
teaches
his
disciples
that
he
will
shortly
ascend
from
the
earth
to
enter
upon
his
celestial
reign
and
that
his
subjects
there
are
to
be
all
who
love
him
and
keep
his
commandments
it
is
to
be
a
kingdom
of
holiness
and
none
will
enter
there
but
the
pure
in
heart
he
says
further
that
as
we
do
now
confess
our
sins
over
the
blood
of
the
victim
we
sacrifice
for
ourselves
in
the
temple
so
henceforth
we
must
look
to
him
by
faith
when
we
shall
see
him
no
longer
slain
a
sacrifice
for
us
and
confess
our
sins
to
the
father
for
his
sake
jesus
has
moreover
taught
his
disciples
that
the
gentiles
are
to
share
equally
with
the
children
of
abraham
the
benefits
of
his
death
and
resurrection
that
this
good
news
shall
be
proclaimed
to
them
by
his
disciples
and
that
they
will
gladly
hear
it
and
believe
the
fountain
of
my
everlasting
kingdom
saith
he
truly
shall
be
laid
upon
earth
in
the
hearts
of
men
but
the
building
is
with
god
eternal
in
the
heavens
the
tomb
through
which
i
have
passed
is
its
gate
and
all
who
would
come
after
me
and
enter
in
must
follow
in
my
footsteps
thomas
then
asked
his
lord
whither
he
would
go
and
the
way
how
he
would
leave
the
earth
since
he
could
die
no
more
thou
shalt
see
for
thyself
ere
many
days
pass
answered
jesus
in
that
i
have
risen
all
whom
my
father
giveth
me
shall
rise
also
from
the
dead
and
those
whom
i
raise
up
i
will
take
with
me
the
way
i
go
for
where
i
am
they
shall
evermore
be
with
me
also
such
dear
father
is
a
brief
account
of
what
john
has
told
us
touching
the
divine
teaching
of
messias
the
son
of
god
respecting
his
kingdom
yet
much
is
still
mysterious
but
we
know
enough
to
be
willing
to
trust
ourselves
to
him
for
this
life
and
for
that
which
is
to
come
we
know
that
all
power
is
given
into
his
hands
and
that
he
can
save
all
men
who
believe
in
and
accept
him
what
is
remarkable
dear
father
notwithstanding
the
jews
have
heard
that
jesus
walks
everywhere
through
jewry
yet
no
efforts
are
made
to
lay
hands
on
him
at
his
presence
crowds
of
his
enemies
fly
like
the
stricken
multitude
before
the
advancing
sirocco
his
presence
in
judea
is
a
present
dread
like
some
great
evil
to
those
who
fear
him
but
like
a
celestial
blessing
to
more
who
love
him
pilate
on
the
eve
of
making
a
journey
last
week
to
bethel
before
quitting
the
city
dispatched
couriers
in
advance
to
ascertain
whether
jesus
the
crucified
was
on
the
line
of
his
route
caiaphas
having
occasion
to
go
to
jericho
a
few
days
after
the
passover
hearing
that
jesus
had
been
seen
with
his
disciples
on
the
road
made
a
circuit
round
by
luz
and
shiloh
in
order
not
to
meet
him
the
gates
of
the
city
are
kept
constantly
shut
lest
he
should
enter
within
the
walls
some
of
the
chief
priests
fearing
greatly
to
behold
his
face
while
others
imagine
that
he
is
engaged
in
raising
an
army
to
advance
upon
and
take
jerusalem
from
the
romans
i
rejoice
to
see
by
your
last
letter
that
you
may
be
expected
to
reach
here
the
week
after
next
oh
that
you
were
here
now
that
you
might
be
taken
by
john
to
see
jesus
for
from
what
he
says
he
will
not
long
remain
visible
among
us
whither
he
goeth
or
how
he
goeth
away
no
man
can
say
faithfully
your
loving
daughter
adina
letter
xxxix
forty
days
after
the
my
dearest
father
with
emotions
that
nearly
deprive
me
of
the
power
to
hold
my
pen
and
with
trembling
fingers
that
make
the
words
i
write
almost
illegible
i
sit
down
to
make
known
to
you
the
extraordinary
event
which
will
mark
this
day
in
all
future
time
as
the
most
worthy
to
be
noted
among
men
on
the
fortieth
day
after
the
resurrection
my
dear
father
early
in
the
morning
jesus
left
the
house
of
mary
and
lazarus
where
he
had
sat
up
with
us
all
night
speaking
to
us
of
the
glories
of
the
life
above
and
the
excellency
of
heart
and
purity
of
life
required
of
all
who
should
enter
it
lord
said
martha
as
he
went
forth
whither
goest
thou
come
and
see
he
answered
whither
i
go
ye
shall
know
and
the
way
ye
shall
know
for
where
i
am
ye
shall
also
be
and
all
those
who
believe
in
me
lord
said
mary
kneeling
at
his
feet
return
at
noon
and
remain
with
us
during
the
heat
of
the
day
mary
said
jesus
laying
his
hand
gently
upon
her
forehead
i
am
going
to
my
father
house
there
thou
shalt
dwell
with
me
in
mansions
not
made
with
hands
thus
speaking
he
walked
slowly
onward
towards
the
hill
of
bethany
not
far
from
the
place
where
lazarus
was
buried
he
was
followed
not
only
by
mary
martha
lazarus
and
john
my
cousin
mary
and
myself
but
by
all
the
disciples
there
were
at
least
five
hundred
persons
in
all
moving
on
with
him
ere
he
reached
the
green
hillside
beyond
the
village
for
all
followed
him
expecting
to
hear
more
glorious
revelations
from
his
lips
he
goes
to
the
hill
to
pray
said
one
of
his
disciples
nay
he
goeth
to
show
us
some
mighty
miracle
from
the
expression
of
power
and
majesty
in
his
aspect
said
thomas
to
me
gazing
upon
the
lord
with
awe
for
each
moment
as
he
ascended
the
hill
his
countenance
grew
more
glorious
with
a
certain
majesty
and
shone
as
the
face
of
moses
descending
from
mount
sinai
we
all
hung
back
with
adoring
awe
and
alone
he
proceeded
onward
a
wide
space
being
left
by
us
between
ourselves
and
him
yet
there
was
no
terror
in
the
glory
which
surrounded
and
shined
out
from
him
but
rather
a
holy
radiance
that
seemed
to
be
the
very
light
of
holiness
and
peace
so
looked
he
said
john
to
us
when
we
beheld
him
transfigured
in
the
mount
with
elias
and
moses
the
hill
which
is
not
lofty
was
soon
surmounted
by
his
sacred
feet
he
stood
upon
its
apex
alone
we
kept
back
near
the
brow
of
the
hill
for
his
raiment
shone
now
like
the
sun
while
his
countenance
was
as
lightning
we
shaded
our
eyes
to
behold
him
all
was
now
expectation
and
a
looking
for
some
mighty
event
what
we
knew
not
john
drew
nearest
to
him
and
upon
his
knees
with
clasped
hands
looked
towards
him
earnestly
for
he
knew
as
he
afterwards
told
us
what
would
take
place
joy
and
yet
tears
were
on
his
face
as
he
gazed
with
blinded
eyes
as
one
gazes
on
the
noonday
sun
upon
his
divine
master
it
was
a
scene
dear
father
impressive
beyond
expression
jesus
seemed
for
a
moment
to
survey
the
scenes
of
his
sufferings
of
his
ignominy
and
death
with
the
look
of
a
divine
conqueror
he
then
turned
to
his
disciples
and
said
ye
have
been
with
me
in
my
sorrows
and
you
shall
now
begin
to
behold
my
glory
remember
all
things
which
i
have
taught
you
concerning
my
kingdom
go
forth
and
teach
the
glad
tidings
of
salvation
to
all
men
and
baptize
all
nations
in
the
name
of
the
father
and
of
the
son
and
of
the
holy
ghost
and
lo
i
am
with
you
alway
even
unto
the
end
of
the
world
thus
speaking
in
a
voice
that
thrilled
every
bosom
with
emotions
indescribable
he
extended
his
hands
above
their
heads
and
blessed
them
while
we
all
fell
upon
our
faces
to
the
ground
also
to
receive
his
blessing
he
then
lifted
up
his
eyes
to
the
calm
blue
depths
of
heaven
and
said
in
the
same
words
he
had
spoken
on
the
night
of
the
passover
as
john
had
told
me
and
now
o
father
glorify
thou
me
with
thine
own
self
with
the
glory
which
i
had
with
thee
before
the
world
was
as
he
spoke
we
raised
our
faces
from
the
ground
to
behold
him
leaving
the
earth
rising
from
the
hilltop
into
the
air
with
a
slow
and
majestic
ascension
his
hands
outspread
over
us
who
were
beneath
as
if
shedding
down
blessings
upon
us
all
the
loud
burst
of
surprise
which
rose
from
five
hundred
voices
at
seeing
him
soar
away
into
the
atmosphere
was
followed
by
a
profound
and
awful
silence
as
we
watched
him
rise
and
still
rise
ascending
and
still
ascending
into
the
upper
air
his
whole
form
growing
brighter
and
brighter
as
the
distance
widened
between
his
feet
and
the
earth
upon
our
knees
in
speechless
wonder
we
followed
his
ascent
with
our
amazed
eyes
not
a
word
being
spoken
by
any
soul
nay
hearts
might
have
been
heard
beating
in
the
intense
expectation
of
the
moment
lo
in
the
height
of
heaven
we
beheld
suddenly
appear
a
bright
cloud
no
larger
than
a
man
hand
but
each
instant
it
expanded
and
grew
broader
and
brighter
and
swift
as
the
winged
lightning
descended
through
the
firmament
downward
until
we
beheld
it
evolve
itself
into
a
glittering
host
of
angels
which
no
man
could
number
countless
as
the
stars
of
heaven
as
these
shining
legions
descended
they
parted
into
two
bands
and
sweeping
along
the
air
met
the
ascending
son
of
god
in
the
rushing
of
their
ten
thousand
times
ten
thousand
wings
was
heard
as
the
sound
of
many
waters
surrounding
jesus
like
a
shining
cloud
they
received
him
into
their
midst
and
hid
him
from
our
eyes
amid
the
glories
of
their
celestial
splendor
now
came
to
our
ears
the
sounds
of
heavenly
song
a
sublimer
chorus
than
earth
ever
heard
before
from
the
squadrons
of
seraphim
and
cherubim
encircling
with
their
linked
wings
the
son
of
god
came
like
the
unearthly
music
one
hears
in
the
dreams
of
night
these
words
receding
as
they
mounted
upward
with
the
conqueror
of
death
and
hell
lift
up
your
heads
o
ye
gates
and
be
ye
lifted
up
ye
everlasting
doors
and
the
king
of
glory
shall
come
in
this
chorus
seemed
to
be
answered
from
the
inmost
heavens
as
if
an
archangel
were
standing
at
its
portals
keeping
watchful
guard
over
the
entrance
facing
the
earth
who
is
the
king
of
glory
the
lord
strong
and
mighty
even
the
lord
mighty
in
battle
against
principalities
and
powers
was
chanted
back
from
the
ascending
escort
of
jesus
in
the
sublimest
strains
of
triumphant
joy
lift
up
your
heads
o
ye
gates
and
be
ye
lifted
up
ye
everlasting
doors
and
the
king
of
glory
shall
come
in
upon
this
we
heard
a
mighty
voice
as
it
were
in
heaven
accompanied
by
the
sound
of
a
trumpet
and
ten
thousand
voices
about
the
throne
of
jehovah
seemed
to
say
god
is
coming
up
with
a
shout
he
rideth
upon
the
heavens
he
ascendeth
on
high
he
hath
led
captivity
captive
and
received
gifts
for
men
o
clap
your
hands
all
ye
people
of
earth
shout
his
triumph
ye
hosts
of
heaven
fling
wide
your
gates
o
city
of
god
be
ye
lifted
up
ye
everlasting
doors
for
the
king
of
glory
enters
in
ascending
and
still
ascending
receding
and
still
receding
fainter
and
fainter
came
down
to
earth
the
angelic
choruses
when
at
length
the
brightest
cloud
of
angels
faded
away
into
the
upper
heaven
the
son
of
god
shining
in
their
midst
like
a
central
sun
surrounded
by
a
luminous
halo
till
finally
like
a
star
they
remained
a
few
moments
longer
and
then
the
heavens
received
him
out
of
our
sight
while
we
stood
gazing
up
into
the
far
skies
hoping
expecting
yet
doubting
if
we
should
ever
behold
him
again
two
bright
stars
seemed
to
be
descending
from
the
height
of
heaven
above
us
in
a
few
seconds
we
saw
that
they
were
angels
alighting
on
the
place
where
jesus
had
left
they
said
to
the
eleven
why
gaze
ye
up
into
heaven
ye
men
of
galilee
this
same
jesus
whom
ye
have
seen
go
into
heaven
shall
so
come
in
like
manner
as
ye
have
now
seen
him
ascend
thus
speaking
they
vanished
out
of
our
sight
such
my
dear
father
is
the
appropriate
crowning
event
of
the
extraordinary
life
of
jesus
both
lord
and
christ
his
kingdom
is
therefore
my
dear
father
clearly
not
of
this
world
as
he
said
to
pilate
the
procurator
but
it
is
above
doubt
then
no
longer
dearest
father
jesus
the
son
of
mary
in
his
human
nature
was
the
son
of
god
in
his
divine
nature
an
incomprehensible
and
mysterious
union
whereby
he
had
brought
together
in
harmony
the
two
natures
separated
far
apart
by
sin
by
giving
his
own
body
as
an
offering
to
reconcile
both
in
one
immaculate
body
upon
the
cross
there
is
now
no
more
condemnation
to
them
who
believe
in
him
and
accept
him
but
i
can
not
write
all
i
would
say
to
you
dearest
father
when
we
meet
which
you
rejoice
me
in
saying
will
be
on
the
first
day
of
the
week
at
jerusalem
i
will
unfold
to
you
all
that
the
divine
and
glorified
jesus
has
taught
me
doubt
not
that
he
is
messias
hesitate
not
to
accept
him
for
he
is
the
end
of
moses
and
of
the
law
and
of
the
prophets
the
very
shiloh
who
should
come
and
restore
all
things
to
whom
be
