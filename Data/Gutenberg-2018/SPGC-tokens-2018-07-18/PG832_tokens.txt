chapter
i
how
robin
hood
became
an
outlaw
list
and
hearken
gentlemen
that
be
of
blood
i
shall
you
tell
of
a
good
yeoman
his
name
was
robin
hood
robin
was
a
proud
outlaw
while
as
he
walked
on
the
ground
so
courteous
an
outlaw
as
he
was
one
was
never
none
else
found
in
the
days
of
good
king
harry
the
second
of
england
he
of
the
warring
sons
there
were
certain
forests
in
the
north
country
set
aside
for
the
king
s
hunting
and
no
man
might
shoot
deer
therein
under
penalty
of
death
these
forests
were
guarded
by
the
king
s
foresters
the
chief
of
whom
in
each
wood
was
no
mean
man
but
equal
in
authority
to
the
sheriff
in
his
walled
town
or
even
to
my
lord
bishop
in
his
abbey
one
of
the
greatest
of
royal
preserves
was
sherwood
and
barnesdale
forests
near
the
two
towns
of
nottingham
and
barnesdale
here
for
some
years
dwelt
one
hugh
fitzooth
as
head
forester
with
his
good
wife
and
son
robert
the
boy
had
been
born
in
lockesley
town
in
the
year
stern
records
say
and
was
often
called
lockesley
or
rob
of
lockesley
he
was
a
comely
stripling
and
as
soon
as
he
was
strong
enough
to
walk
his
chief
delight
was
to
go
with
his
father
into
the
forest
as
soon
as
his
right
arm
received
thew
and
sinew
he
learned
to
draw
the
long
bow
and
speed
a
true
arrow
while
on
winter
evenings
his
greatest
joy
was
to
hear
his
father
tell
of
bold
will
o
the
green
the
outlaw
who
for
many
summers
defied
the
king
s
foresters
and
feasted
with
his
men
upon
king
s
deer
and
on
other
stormy
days
the
boy
learned
to
whittle
out
a
straight
shaft
for
the
long
bow
and
tip
it
with
gray
goose
feathers
the
fond
mother
sighed
when
she
saw
the
boy
s
face
light
up
at
these
woodland
tales
she
was
of
gentle
birth
and
had
hoped
to
see
her
son
famous
at
court
or
abbey
she
taught
him
to
read
and
to
write
to
doff
his
cap
without
awkwardness
and
to
answer
directly
and
truthfully
both
lord
and
peasant
but
the
boy
although
he
took
kindly
to
these
lessons
of
breeding
was
yet
happiest
when
he
had
his
beloved
bow
in
hand
and
strolled
at
will
listening
to
the
murmur
of
the
trees
two
playmates
had
rob
in
these
gladsome
early
days
one
was
will
gamewell
his
father
s
brother
s
son
who
lived
at
gamewell
lodge
hard
by
nottingham
town
the
other
was
marian
fitzwalter
only
child
of
the
earl
of
huntingdon
the
castle
of
huntingdon
could
be
seen
from
the
top
of
one
of
the
tall
trees
in
sherwood
and
on
more
than
one
bright
day
rob
s
white
signal
from
this
tree
told
marian
that
he
awaited
her
there
for
you
must
know
that
rob
did
not
visit
her
at
the
castle
his
father
and
her
father
were
enemies
some
people
whispered
that
hugh
fitzooth
was
the
rightful
earl
of
huntingdon
but
that
he
had
been
defrauded
out
of
his
lands
by
fitzwalter
who
had
won
the
king
s
favor
by
a
crusade
to
the
holy
land
but
little
cared
rob
or
marian
for
this
enmity
however
it
had
arisen
they
knew
that
the
great
green
wood
was
open
to
them
and
that
the
wide
wide
world
was
full
of
the
scent
of
flowers
and
the
song
of
birds
days
of
youth
speed
all
too
swiftly
and
troubled
skies
come
all
too
soon
rob
s
father
had
two
other
enemies
besides
fitzwalter
in
the
persons
of
the
lean
sheriff
of
nottingham
and
the
fat
bishop
of
hereford
these
three
enemies
one
day
got
possession
of
the
king
s
ear
and
whispered
therein
to
such
good
or
evil
purpose
that
hugh
fitzooth
was
removed
from
his
post
of
king
s
forester
he
and
his
wife
and
rob
then
a
youth
of
nineteen
were
descended
upon
during
a
cold
winter
s
evening
and
dispossessed
without
warning
the
sheriff
arrested
the
forester
for
treason
of
which
poor
man
he
was
as
guiltless
as
you
or
i
and
carried
him
to
nottingham
jail
rob
and
his
mother
were
sheltered
over
night
in
the
jail
also
but
next
morning
were
roughly
bade
to
go
about
their
business
thereupon
they
turned
for
succor
to
their
only
kinsman
squire
george
of
gamewell
who
sheltered
them
in
all
kindness
but
the
shock
and
the
winter
night
s
journey
proved
too
much
for
dame
fitzooth
she
had
not
been
strong
for
some
time
before
leaving
the
forest
in
less
than
two
months
she
was
no
more
rob
felt
as
though
his
heart
was
broken
at
this
loss
but
scarcely
had
the
first
spring
flowers
begun
to
blossom
upon
her
grave
when
he
met
another
crushing
blow
in
the
loss
of
his
father
that
stern
man
had
died
in
prison
before
his
accusers
could
agree
upon
the
charges
by
which
he
was
to
be
brought
to
trial
two
years
passed
by
rob
s
cousin
will
was
away
at
school
and
marian
s
father
who
had
learned
of
her
friendship
with
rob
had
sent
his
daughter
to
the
court
of
queen
eleanor
so
these
years
were
lonely
ones
to
the
orphaned
lad
the
bluff
old
squire
was
kind
to
him
but
secretly
could
make
nothing
of
one
who
went
about
brooding
and
as
though
seeking
for
something
he
had
lost
the
truth
is
that
rob
missed
his
old
life
in
the
forest
no
less
than
his
mother
s
gentleness
and
his
father
s
companionship
every
time
he
twanged
the
string
of
the
long
bow
against
his
shoulder
and
heard
the
gray
goose
shaft
sing
it
told
him
of
happy
days
that
he
could
not
recall
one
morning
as
rob
came
in
to
breakfast
his
uncle
greeted
him
with
i
have
news
for
you
rob
my
lad
and
the
hearty
old
squire
finished
his
draught
of
ale
and
set
his
pewter
tankard
down
with
a
crash
what
may
that
be
uncle
gamewell
asked
the
young
man
here
is
a
chance
to
exercise
your
good
long
bow
and
win
a
pretty
prize
the
fair
is
on
at
nottingham
and
the
sheriff
proclaims
an
archer
s
tournament
the
best
fellows
are
to
have
places
with
the
king
s
foresters
and
the
one
who
shoots
straightest
of
all
will
win
for
prize
a
golden
arrow
a
useless
bauble
enough
but
just
the
thing
for
your
lady
love
eh
rob
my
boy
here
the
squire
laughed
and
whacked
the
table
again
with
his
tankard
rob
s
eyes
sparkled
twere
indeed
worth
shooting
for
uncle
mine
he
said
i
should
dearly
love
to
let
arrow
fly
alongside
another
man
and
a
place
among
the
foresters
is
what
i
have
long
desired
will
you
let
me
try
to
be
sure
rejoined
his
uncle
well
i
know
that
your
good
mother
would
have
had
me
make
a
clerk
of
you
but
well
i
see
that
the
greenwood
is
where
you
will
pass
your
days
so
here
s
luck
to
you
in
the
bout
and
the
huge
tankard
came
a
third
time
into
play
the
young
man
thanked
his
uncle
for
his
good
wishes
and
set
about
making
preparations
for
the
journey
he
traveled
lightly
but
his
yew
bow
must
needs
have
a
new
string
and
his
arrows
must
be
of
the
straightest
and
soundest
one
fine
morning
a
few
days
after
rob
might
have
been
seen
passing
by
way
of
lockesley
through
sherwood
forest
to
nottingham
town
briskly
walked
he
and
gaily
for
his
hopes
were
high
and
never
an
enemy
had
he
in
the
wide
world
but
twas
the
very
last
morning
in
all
his
life
when
he
was
to
lack
an
enemy
for
as
he
went
his
way
through
sherwood
whistling
a
blithe
tune
he
came
suddenly
upon
a
group
of
foresters
making
merry
beneath
the
spreading
branches
of
an
they
had
a
huge
meat
pie
before
them
and
were
washing
down
prodigious
slices
of
it
with
nut
brown
ale
one
glance
at
the
leader
and
rob
knew
at
once
that
he
had
found
an
enemy
twas
the
man
who
had
usurped
his
father
s
place
as
head
forester
and
who
had
roughly
turned
his
mother
out
in
the
snow
but
never
a
word
said
he
for
good
or
bad
and
would
have
passed
on
his
way
had
not
this
man
clearing
his
throat
with
a
huge
gulp
bellowed
out
by
my
troth
here
is
a
pretty
little
archer
where
go
you
my
lad
with
that
tupenny
bow
and
toy
arrows
belike
he
would
shoot
at
nottingham
fair
ho
ho
a
roar
of
laughter
greeted
this
sally
rob
flushed
for
he
was
mightily
proud
of
his
shooting
my
bow
is
as
good
as
yours
he
retorted
and
my
shafts
will
carry
as
straight
and
as
far
so
i
ll
not
take
lessons
of
any
of
they
laughed
again
loudly
at
this
and
the
leader
said
with
frown
show
us
some
of
your
skill
and
if
you
can
hit
the
mark
here
s
twenty
silver
pennies
for
you
but
if
you
hit
it
not
you
are
in
for
a
sound
drubbing
for
your
pick
your
own
target
quoth
rob
in
a
fine
rage
i
ll
lay
my
head
against
that
purse
that
i
can
hit
it
shall
be
as
you
say
retorted
the
forester
angrily
your
head
for
your
sauciness
that
you
hit
not
my
now
at
a
little
rise
in
the
wood
a
herd
of
deer
came
grazing
by
distant
full
fivescore
yards
they
were
king
s
deer
but
at
that
distance
seemed
safe
from
any
harm
the
head
forester
pointed
to
them
if
your
young
arm
could
speed
a
shaft
for
half
that
distance
i
d
shoot
with
done
cried
rob
my
head
against
twenty
pennies
i
ll
cause
yon
fine
fellow
in
the
lead
of
them
to
breathe
his
and
without
more
ado
he
tried
the
string
of
his
long
bow
placed
a
shaft
thereon
and
drew
it
to
his
ear
a
moment
and
the
quivering
string
sang
death
as
the
shaft
whistled
across
the
glade
another
moment
and
the
leader
of
the
herd
leaped
high
in
his
tracks
and
fell
prone
dyeing
the
sward
with
his
heart
s
blood
a
murmur
of
amazement
swept
through
the
foresters
and
then
a
growl
of
rage
he
that
had
wagered
was
angriest
of
all
know
you
what
you
have
done
rash
youth
he
said
you
have
killed
a
king
s
deer
and
by
the
laws
of
king
harry
your
head
remains
forfeit
talk
not
to
me
of
pennies
but
get
ye
gone
straight
and
let
me
not
look
upon
your
face
rob
s
blood
boiled
within
him
and
he
uttered
a
rash
speech
i
have
looked
upon
your
face
once
too
often
already
my
fine
forester
tis
you
who
wear
my
father
s
and
with
this
he
turned
upon
his
heel
and
strode
away
the
forester
heard
his
parting
thrust
with
an
oath
red
with
rage
he
seized
his
bow
strung
an
arrow
and
without
warning
launched
it
full
af
rob
well
was
it
for
the
latter
that
the
forester
s
foot
turned
on
a
twig
at
the
critical
instant
for
as
it
was
the
arrow
whizzed
by
his
ear
so
close
as
to
take
a
stray
strand
of
his
hair
with
it
rob
turned
upon
his
assailant
now
twoscore
yards
away
ha
said
he
you
shoot
not
so
straight
as
i
for
all
your
bravado
take
this
from
the
tupenny
bow
straight
flew
his
answering
shaft
the
head
forester
gave
one
cry
then
fell
face
downward
and
lay
still
his
life
had
avenged
rob
s
father
but
the
son
was
outlawed
forward
he
ran
through
the
forest
before
the
band
could
gather
their
scattered
wits
still
forward
into
the
great
greenwood
the
swaying
trees
seemed
to
open
their
arms
to
the
wanderer
and
to
welcome
him
home
toward
the
close
of
the
same
day
rob
paused
hungry
and
weary
at
the
cottage
of
a
poor
widow
who
dwelt
upon
the
outskirts
of
the
forest
now
this
widow
had
often
greeted
him
kindly
in
his
boyhood
days
giving
him
to
eat
and
drink
so
he
boldly
entered
her
door
the
old
dame
was
right
glad
to
see
him
and
baked
him
cakes
in
the
ashes
and
had
him
rest
and
tell
her
his
story
then
she
shook
her
head
tis
an
evil
wind
that
blows
through
sherwood
she
said
the
poor
are
despoiled
and
the
rich
ride
over
their
bodies
my
three
sons
have
been
outlawed
for
shooting
king
s
deer
to
keep
us
from
starving
and
now
hide
in
the
wood
and
they
tell
me
that
twoscore
of
as
good
men
as
ever
drew
bow
are
in
hiding
with
where
are
they
good
mother
cried
rob
by
my
faith
i
will
join
nay
nay
replied
the
old
woman
at
first
but
when
she
saw
that
there
was
no
other
way
she
said
my
sons
will
visit
me
stay
you
here
and
see
them
if
you
so
rob
stayed
willingly
to
see
the
widow
s
sons
that
night
for
they
were
men
after
his
own
heart
and
when
they
found
that
his
mood
was
with
them
they
made
him
swear
an
oath
of
fealty
and
told
him
the
haunt
of
the
band
a
place
he
knew
right
well
finally
one
of
them
said
but
the
band
lacks
a
leader
one
who
can
use
his
head
as
well
as
his
hand
so
we
have
agreed
that
he
who
has
skill
enough
to
go
to
nottingham
an
outlaw
and
win
the
prize
at
archery
shall
be
our
rob
sprang
to
his
feet
said
in
good
time
cried
he
for
i
had
started
to
that
fair
and
all
the
foresters
and
all
the
sheriff
s
men
in
christendom
shall
not
stand
between
me
and
the
center
of
their
target
and
though
he
was
but
barely
grown
he
stood
so
straight
and
his
eye
flashed
with
such
fire
that
the
three
brothers
seized
his
hand
and
shouted
a
lockesley
a
lockesley
if
you
win
the
golden
arrow
you
shall
be
chief
of
outlaws
in
sherwood
forest
so
rob
fell
to
planning
how
he
could
disguise
himself
to
go
to
nottingham
town
for
he
knew
that
the
foresters
had
even
then
set
a
price
on
his
head
in
the
it
was
even
as
rob
had
surmised
the
sheriff
of
nottingham
posted
a
reward
of
two
hundred
pounds
for
the
capture
dead
or
alive
of
one
robert
fitzooth
outlaw
and
the
crowds
thronging
the
streets
upon
that
busy
fair
day
often
paused
to
read
the
notice
and
talk
together
about
the
death
of
the
head
forester
but
what
with
wrestling
bouts
and
bouts
with
and
wandering
minstrels
there
came
up
so
many
other
things
to
talk
about
that
the
reward
was
forgotten
for
the
nonce
and
only
the
foresters
and
sheriff
s
men
watched
the
gates
with
diligence
the
sheriff
indeed
spurring
them
to
effort
by
offers
of
largess
his
hatred
of
the
father
had
descended
to
the
son
the
great
event
of
the
day
came
in
the
afternoon
it
was
the
archer
s
contest
for
the
golden
arrow
and
twenty
men
stepped
forth
to
shoot
among
them
was
a
a
sorry
looking
fellow
with
leggings
of
different
colors
and
brown
scratched
face
and
hands
over
a
tawny
shock
of
hair
he
had
a
hood
drawn
much
like
that
of
a
monk
slowly
he
limped
to
his
place
in
the
line
while
the
mob
shouted
in
derision
but
the
contest
was
open
to
all
comers
so
no
man
said
him
nay
side
by
side
with
rob
for
it
was
he
stood
a
muscular
fellow
of
swarthy
visage
and
with
one
eye
hid
by
a
green
bandage
him
also
the
crowd
jeered
but
he
passed
them
by
with
indifference
while
he
tried
his
bow
with
practiced
hand
a
great
crowd
had
assembled
in
the
amphitheater
enclosing
the
lists
all
the
gentry
and
populace
of
the
surrounding
country
were
gathered
there
in
eager
expectancy
the
central
box
contained
the
lean
but
pompous
sheriff
his
bejeweled
wife
and
their
daughter
a
supercilious
young
woman
enough
who
it
was
openly
hinted
was
hoping
to
receive
the
golden
arrow
from
the
victor
and
thus
be
crowned
queen
of
the
day
next
to
the
sheriff
s
box
was
one
occupied
by
the
fat
bishop
of
hereford
while
in
the
other
side
was
a
box
wherein
sat
a
girl
whose
dark
hair
dark
eyes
and
fair
features
caused
rob
s
heart
to
leap
twas
maid
marian
she
had
come
up
for
a
visit
from
the
queen
s
court
at
london
town
and
now
sat
demurely
by
her
father
the
earl
of
huntingdon
if
rob
had
been
grimly
resolved
to
win
the
arrow
before
the
sight
of
her
sweet
face
multiplied
his
determination
an
hundredfold
he
felt
his
muscles
tightening
into
bands
of
steel
tense
and
true
yet
withal
his
heart
would
throb
making
him
quake
in
a
most
unaccountable
way
then
the
trumpet
sounded
and
the
crowd
became
silent
while
the
herald
announced
the
terms
of
the
contest
the
lists
were
open
to
all
comers
the
first
target
was
to
be
placed
at
thirty
ells
distance
and
all
those
who
hit
its
center
were
allowed
to
shoot
at
the
second
target
placed
ten
ells
farther
off
the
third
target
was
to
be
removed
yet
farther
until
the
winner
was
proved
the
winner
was
to
receive
the
golden
arrow
and
a
place
with
the
king
s
foresters
he
it
was
also
who
crowned
the
queen
of
the
day
the
trumpet
sounded
again
and
the
archers
prepared
to
shoot
rob
looked
to
his
string
while
the
crowd
smiled
and
whispered
at
the
odd
figure
he
cut
with
his
legs
and
little
cape
but
as
the
first
man
shot
they
grew
silent
the
target
was
not
so
far
but
that
twelve
out
of
the
twenty
contestants
reached
its
inner
circle
rob
shot
sixth
in
the
line
and
landed
fairly
being
rewarded
by
an
approving
grunt
from
the
man
with
the
green
blinder
who
shot
seventh
and
with
apparent
carelessness
yet
true
to
the
bull
the
mob
cheered
and
yelled
themselves
hoarse
at
this
even
marksmanship
the
trumpet
sounded
again
and
a
new
target
was
set
up
at
forty
ells
the
first
three
archers
again
struck
true
amid
the
loud
applause
of
the
onlookers
for
they
were
general
favorites
and
expected
to
win
indeed
twas
whispered
that
each
was
backed
by
one
of
the
three
dignitaries
of
the
day
the
fourth
and
fifth
archers
barely
grazed
the
center
rob
fitted
his
arrow
quietly
and
with
some
confidence
sped
it
unerringly
toward
the
shining
circle
the
beggar
the
beggar
yelled
the
crowd
another
bull
for
the
beggar
in
truth
his
shaft
was
nearer
the
center
than
any
of
the
others
but
it
was
not
so
near
that
blinder
as
the
mob
had
promptly
christened
his
neighbor
did
not
place
his
shaft
just
within
the
mark
again
the
crowd
cheered
wildly
such
shooting
as
this
was
not
seen
every
day
in
nottingham
town
the
other
archers
in
this
round
were
disconcerted
by
the
preceding
shots
or
unable
to
keep
the
pace
they
missed
one
after
another
and
dropped
moodily
back
while
the
trumpet
sounded
for
the
third
round
and
the
target
was
set
up
fifty
ells
distant
by
my
halidom
you
draw
a
good
bow
young
master
said
rob
s
queer
comrade
to
him
in
the
interval
allowed
for
rest
do
you
wish
me
to
shoot
first
on
this
trial
nay
said
rob
but
you
are
a
good
fellow
by
this
token
and
if
i
win
not
i
hope
you
may
keep
the
prize
from
yon
and
he
nodded
scornfully
to
the
three
other
archers
who
were
surrounded
by
their
admirers
and
were
being
made
much
of
by
retainers
of
the
sheriff
the
bishop
and
the
earl
from
them
his
eye
wandered
toward
maid
marian
s
booth
she
had
been
watching
him
it
seemed
for
their
eyes
met
then
hers
were
hastily
averted
blinder
s
quick
eye
followed
those
of
rob
a
fair
maid
that
he
said
smilingly
and
one
more
worthy
the
golden
arrow
than
the
sheriff
s
haughty
rob
looked
at
him
swiftly
and
saw
naught
but
kindliness
in
his
glance
you
are
a
shrewd
fellow
and
i
like
you
well
was
his
only
comment
now
the
archers
prepared
to
shoot
again
each
with
some
little
care
the
target
seemed
hardly
larger
than
the
inner
ring
had
looked
at
the
first
trial
the
first
three
sped
their
shafts
and
while
they
were
fair
shots
they
did
not
more
than
graze
the
inner
circle
rob
took
his
stand
with
some
misgiving
some
flecking
clouds
overhead
made
the
light
uncertain
and
a
handful
of
wind
frolicked
across
the
range
in
a
way
quite
disturbing
to
a
bowman
s
nerves
his
eyes
wandered
for
a
brief
moment
to
the
box
wherein
sat
the
girl
his
heart
leaped
she
met
his
glance
and
smiled
at
him
reassuringly
and
in
that
moment
he
felt
that
she
knew
him
despite
his
disguise
and
looked
to
him
to
keep
the
honor
of
old
sherwood
he
drew
his
bow
firmly
and
taking
advantage
of
a
momentary
lull
in
the
breeze
launched
the
arrow
straight
and
across
the
range
to
the
center
of
the
target
the
beggar
the
beggar
a
bull
a
bull
yelled
the
fickle
mob
who
from
jeering
him
were
now
his
warm
friends
can
you
beat
that
blinder
the
last
archer
smiled
scornfully
and
made
ready
he
drew
his
bow
with
ease
and
grace
and
without
seeming
to
study
the
course
released
the
winged
arrow
forward
it
leaped
toward
the
target
and
all
eyes
followed
its
flight
a
loud
uproar
broke
forth
when
it
alighted
just
without
the
center
and
grazing
the
shaft
sent
by
rob
the
stranger
made
a
gesture
of
surprise
when
his
own
eyes
announced
the
result
to
him
but
saw
his
error
he
had
not
allowed
for
the
fickle
gust
of
wind
which
seized
the
arrow
and
carried
it
to
one
side
but
for
all
that
he
was
the
first
to
congratulate
the
victor
i
hope
we
may
shoot
again
quoth
he
in
truth
i
care
not
for
the
golden
bauble
and
wished
to
win
it
in
despite
of
the
sheriff
for
whom
i
have
no
love
now
crown
the
lady
of
your
and
turning
suddenly
he
was
lost
in
the
crowd
before
rob
could
utter
what
it
was
upon
his
lips
to
say
that
he
would
shoot
again
with
him
and
now
the
herald
summoned
rob
to
the
sheriff
s
box
to
receive
the
prize
you
are
a
curious
fellow
enough
said
the
sheriff
biting
his
lip
coldly
yet
you
shoot
well
what
name
go
you
by
marian
sat
near
and
was
listening
intently
i
am
called
rob
the
stroller
my
lord
sheriff
said
the
archer
marian
leaned
back
and
smiled
well
rob
the
stroller
with
a
little
attention
to
your
skin
and
clothes
you
would
not
be
so
bad
a
man
said
the
sheriff
how
like
you
the
idea
of
entering
my
service
rob
the
stroller
has
ever
been
a
free
man
my
lord
and
desires
no
the
sheriff
s
brow
darkened
yet
for
the
sake
of
his
daughter
and
the
golden
arrow
he
dissembled
rob
the
stroller
said
he
here
is
the
golden
arrow
which
has
been
offered
to
the
best
of
archers
this
day
you
are
awarded
the
prize
see
that
you
bestow
it
at
this
point
the
herald
nudged
rob
and
half
inclined
his
head
toward
the
sheriff
s
daughter
who
sat
with
a
thin
smile
upon
her
lips
but
rob
heeded
him
not
he
took
the
arrow
and
strode
to
the
next
box
where
sat
maid
marian
lady
he
said
pray
accept
this
little
pledge
from
a
poor
stroller
who
would
devote
the
best
shafts
in
his
quiver
to
serve
my
thanks
to
you
rob
in
the
hood
replied
she
with
a
roguish
twinkle
in
her
eye
and
she
placed
the
gleaming
arrow
in
her
hair
while
the
people
shouted
the
queen
the
queen
the
sheriff
glowered
furiously
upon
this
ragged
archer
who
had
refused
his
service
taken
his
prize
without
a
word
of
thanks
and
snubbed
his
daughter
he
would
have
spoken
but
his
proud
daughter
restrained
him
he
called
to
his
guard
and
bade
them
watch
the
beggar
but
rob
had
already
turned
swiftly
lost
himself
in
the
throng
and
headed
straight
for
the
town
gate
that
same
evening
within
a
forest
glade
a
group
of
men
some
twoscore
clad
in
lincoln
green
sat
round
a
fire
roasting
venison
and
making
merry
suddenly
a
twig
crackled
and
they
sprang
to
their
feet
and
seized
their
weapons
i
look
for
the
widow
s
sons
a
clear
voice
said
and
i
come
instantly
the
three
men
stepped
forward
tis
rob
they
cried
welcome
to
sherwood
forest
rob
and
all
the
men
came
and
greeted
him
for
they
had
heard
his
story
then
one
of
the
widow
s
sons
stout
will
stepped
forth
and
said
comrades
all
ye
know
that
our
band
has
sadly
lacked
a
leader
one
of
birth
breeding
and
skill
belike
we
have
found
that
leader
in
this
young
man
and
i
and
my
brothers
have
told
him
that
the
band
would
choose
that
one
who
should
bring
the
sheriff
to
shame
this
day
and
capture
his
golden
arrow
is
it
not
so
the
band
gave
assent
will
turned
to
rob
what
news
bring
you
from
nottingham
town
asked
he
rob
laughed
in
truth
i
brought
the
sheriff
to
shame
for
mine
own
pleasure
and
won
his
golden
arrow
to
boot
but
as
to
the
prize
ye
must
e
en
take
my
word
for
i
bestowed
it
upon
a
and
seeing
the
men
stood
in
doubt
at
this
he
continued
but
i
ll
gladly
join
your
band
and
you
take
me
as
a
common
archer
for
there
are
others
older
and
mayhap
more
skilled
than
then
stepped
one
forward
from
the
rest
a
tall
swarthy
man
and
rob
recognized
him
as
the
man
with
the
green
blinder
only
this
was
now
removed
and
his
freed
eye
gleamed
as
stoutly
as
the
other
one
rob
in
the
hood
for
such
the
lady
called
you
said
he
i
can
vouch
for
your
tale
you
shamed
the
sheriff
e
en
as
i
had
hoped
to
do
and
we
can
forego
the
golden
arrow
since
it
is
in
such
fair
hands
as
to
your
shooting
and
mine
we
must
let
future
days
decide
but
here
i
will
stutely
declare
that
i
will
serve
none
other
chief
save
only
then
good
will
stutely
told
the
outlaws
of
rob
s
deeds
and
gave
him
his
hand
of
fealty
and
the
widow
s
sons
did
likewise
and
the
other
members
every
one
right
gladly
because
will
stutely
had
heretofore
been
the
truest
bow
in
all
the
company
and
they
toasted
him
in
nut
brown
ale
and
hailed
him
as
their
leader
by
the
name
of
robin
hood
and
he
accepted
that
name
because
maid
marian
had
said
it
by
the
light
of
the
the
band
exchanged
signs
and
passwords
they
gave
robin
hood
a
horn
upon
which
he
was
to
blow
to
summon
them
they
swore
also
that
while
they
might
take
money
and
goods
from
the
unjust
rich
they
would
aid
and
befriend
the
poor
and
the
helpless
and
that
they
would
harm
no
woman
be
she
maid
wife
or
widow
they
swore
all
this
with
solemn
oaths
while
they
feasted
about
the
ruddy
blaze
under
the
greenwood
tree
and
that
is
how
robin
hood
became
an
outlaw
chapter
ii
how
robin
hood
met
little
john
o
here
is
my
hand
the
stranger
reply
d
i
ll
serve
you
with
all
my
whole
heart
my
name
is
john
little
a
man
of
good
mettle
ne
er
doubt
me
for
i
ll
play
my
his
name

be

quoth
william
stutely
and
i
will
his
godfather
be
prepare
then
a
feast
and
none
of
the
least
for
we
will
be
merry
quoth
he
all
that
summer
robin
hood
and
his
merry
men
roamed
in
sherwood
forest
and
the
fame
of
their
deeds
ran
abroad
in
the
land
the
sheriff
of
nottingham
waxed
wroth
at
the
report
but
all
his
traps
and
excursions
failed
to
catch
the
outlaws
the
poor
people
began
by
fearing
them
but
when
they
found
that
the
men
in
lincoln
green
who
answered
robin
hood
s
horn
meant
them
no
harm
but
despoiled
the
oppressor
to
relieve
the
oppressed
they
gan
to
have
great
liking
for
them
and
the
band
increased
by
other
stout
hearts
till
by
the
end
of
the
summer
fourscore
good
men
and
true
had
sworn
fealty
but
the
days
of
quiet
which
came
on
grew
irksome
to
robin
s
adventurous
spirit
up
rose
he
one
gay
morn
and
slung
his
quiver
over
his
shoulders
this
fresh
breeze
stirs
the
blood
my
lads
quoth
he
and
i
would
be
seeing
what
the
gay
world
looks
like
in
the
direction
of
nottingham
town
but
tarry
ye
behind
in
the
borders
of
the
forest
within
earshot
of
my
bugle
thus
saying
he
strode
merrily
forward
to
the
edge
of
the
wood
and
paused
there
a
moment
his
agile
form
erect
his
brown
locks
flowing
and
his
brown
eyes
watching
the
road
and
a
goodly
sight
he
made
as
the
wind
blew
the
ruddy
color
into
his
cheeks
the
highway
led
clear
in
the
direction
of
the
town
and
thither
he
boldly
directed
his
steps
but
at
a
bend
in
the
road
he
knew
of
a
leading
across
a
brook
which
made
the
way
nearer
and
less
open
into
which
he
turned
as
he
approached
the
stream
he
saw
that
it
had
become
swollen
by
recent
rains
into
quite
a
pretty
torrent
the
log
was
still
there
but
at
this
end
of
it
a
puddle
intervened
which
could
be
crossed
only
with
a
leap
if
you
would
not
get
your
feet
wet
but
robin
cared
little
for
such
a
handicap
taking
a
running
start
his
nimble
legs
carried
him
easily
over
and
balanced
neatly
upon
the
end
of
the
broad
log
but
he
was
no
sooner
started
across
than
he
saw
a
tall
stranger
coming
from
the
other
side
thereupon
robin
quickened
his
pace
and
the
stranger
did
likewise
each
thinking
to
cross
first
midway
they
met
and
neither
would
yield
an
inch
give
way
fellow
roared
robin
whose
leadership
of
a
band
i
am
afraid
had
not
tended
to
mend
his
manners
the
stranger
smiled
he
was
almost
a
head
taller
than
the
other
nay
he
retorted
fair
and
softly
i
give
way
only
to
a
better
man
than
give
way
i
say
repeated
robin
or
i
shall
have
to
show
you
a
better
his
opponent
budged
not
an
inch
but
laughed
loudly
now
by
my
halidom
he
said
i
would
not
move
after
hearing
that
speech
even
if
minded
to
it
before
for
this
better
man
i
have
sought
my
life
long
therefore
show
him
to
me
an
it
please
that
will
i
right
soon
quoth
robin
stay
you
here
a
little
while
till
i
cut
me
a
cudgel
like
unto
that
you
have
been
twiddling
in
your
so
saying
he
sought
his
own
bank
again
with
a
leap
laid
aside
his
long
bow
and
arrows
and
cut
him
a
stout
staff
of
oak
straight
knotless
and
a
good
six
feet
in
length
but
still
it
was
a
full
foot
shorter
than
his
opponent
s
then
back
came
he
boldly
i
mind
not
telling
you
fellow
said
he
that
a
bout
with
archery
would
have
been
an
easier
way
with
me
but
there
are
other
tunes
in
england
besides
that
the
arrow
here
he
whirred
the
staff
about
his
head
by
way
of
practice
so
make
you
ready
for
the
tune
i
am
about
to
play
upon
your
ribs
have
at
you
one
two
three
roared
the
giant
smiting
at
him
instantly
well
was
it
for
robin
that
he
was
quick
and
nimble
of
foot
for
the
blow
that
grazed
a
hair
s
breadth
from
his
shoulder
would
have
felled
an
ox
nevertheless
while
swerving
to
avoid
this
stroke
robin
was
poising
for
his
own
and
back
came
he
forthwith
whack
whack
parried
the
other
whack
whack
whack
whack
the
fight
waxed
fast
and
furious
it
was
strength
pitted
against
subtlety
and
the
match
was
a
merry
one
the
mighty
blows
of
the
stranger
went
whistling
around
robin
s
ducking
head
while
his
own
swift
undercuts
were
fain
to
give
the
other
an
attack
of
indigestion
yet
each
stood
firmly
in
his
place
not
moving
backward
or
forward
a
foot
for
a
good
half
hour
nor
thinking
of
crying
enough
though
some
chance
blow
seemed
likely
to
knock
one
or
the
other
off
the
narrow
the
giant
s
face
was
getting
red
and
his
breath
came
snorting
forth
like
a
bull
s
he
stepped
forward
with
a
furious
onslaught
to
finish
this
audacious
fellow
robin
dodged
his
blows
lightly
then
sprang
in
swiftly
and
unexpectedly
and
dealt
the
stranger
such
a
blow
upon
the
short
ribs
that
you
would
have
sworn
the
tanner
was
trimming
down
his
hides
for
market
the
stranger
reeled
and
came
within
an
ace
of
falling
but
regained
his
footing
right
quickly
by
my
life
you
can
hit
hard
he
gasped
forth
giving
back
a
blow
almost
while
he
was
yet
staggering
this
blow
was
a
lucky
one
it
caught
robin
off
his
guard
his
stick
had
rested
a
moment
while
he
looked
to
see
the
giant
topple
into
the
water
when
down
came
the
other
upon
his
head
whack
robin
saw
more
stars
in
that
one
moment
than
all
the
astronomers
have
since
discovered
and
forthwith
he
dropped
neatly
into
the
stream
the
cool
rushing
current
quickly
brought
him
to
his
senses
howbeit
he
was
still
so
dazed
that
he
groped
blindly
for
the
swaying
reeds
to
pull
himself
up
on
the
bank
his
assailant
could
not
forbear
laughing
heartily
at
his
plight
but
was
also
quick
to
lend
his
aid
he
thrust
down
his
long
staff
to
robin
crying
lay
hold
of
that
an
your
fists
whirl
not
so
much
as
your
head
robin
laid
hold
and
was
hauled
to
dry
land
for
all
the
world
like
a
fish
except
that
the
fish
would
never
have
come
forth
so
wet
and
dripping
he
lay
upon
the
warm
bank
for
a
space
to
regain
his
senses
then
he
sat
up
and
gravely
rubbed
his
pate
by
all
the
saints
said
he
you
hit
full
stoutly
my
head
hums
like
a
hive
of
bees
on
a
summer
then
he
seized
his
horn
which
lay
near
and
blew
thereon
three
shrill
notes
that
echoed
against
the
trees
a
moment
of
silence
ensued
and
then
was
heard
the
rustling
of
leaves
and
crackling
of
twigs
like
the
coming
of
many
men
and
forth
from
the
glade
burst
a
score
or
two
of
stalwart
yeomen
all
clad
in
lincoln
green
like
robin
with
good
will
stutely
and
the
widow
s
three
sons
at
their
head
good
master
cried
will
stutely
how
is
this
in
sooth
there
is
not
a
dry
thread
on
your
why
marry
replied
robin
this
fellow
would
not
let
me
pass
the
footbridge
and
when
i
tickled
him
in
the
ribs
he
must
needs
answer
by
a
pat
on
the
head
which
landed
me
then
shall
he
taste
some
of
his
own
porridge
quoth
will
seize
him
lads
nay
let
him
go
free
said
robin
the
fight
was
a
fair
one
and
i
abide
by
it
i
surmise
you
also
are
quits
he
continued
turning
to
the
stranger
with
a
twinkling
eye
i
am
content
said
the
other
for
verily
you
now
have
the
best
end
of
the
cudgel
wherefore
i
like
you
well
and
would
fain
know
your
why
said
robin
my
men
and
even
the
sheriff
of
nottingham
know
me
as
robin
hood
the
then
am
i
right
sorry
that
i
beat
you
exclaimed
the
man
for
i
was
on
my
way
to
seek
you
and
to
try
to
join
your
merry
company
but
after
my
unmannerly
use
of
the
cudgel
i
fear
we
are
still
nay
never
say
it
cried
robin
i
am
glad
i
fell
in
with
you
though
sooth
to
say
i
did
all
the
falling
and
amid
a
general
laugh
the
two
men
clasped
hands
and
in
that
clasp
the
strong
friendship
of
a
lifetime
was
begun
but
you
have
not
yet
told
us
your
name
said
robin
bethinking
himself
whence
i
came
men
call
me
john
enter
our
company
then
john
little
enter
and
welcome
the
rites
are
few
the
fee
is
large
we
ask
your
whole
mind
and
body
and
heart
even
unto
i
give
the
bond
upon
my
life
said
the
tall
man
thereupon
will
stutely
who
loved
a
good
jest
spoke
up
and
said
the
infant
in
our
household
must
be
christened
and
i
ll
stand
godfather
this
fair
little
stranger
is
so
small
of
bone
and
sinew
that
his
old
name
is
not
to
the
here
he
paused
long
enough
to
fill
a
horn
in
the
stream
hark
ye
my
son
standing
on
tiptoe
to
splash
the
water
on
the
giant
take
your
new
name
on
entering
the
forest
i
christen
you
little
at
this
jest
the
men
roared
long
and
loud
give
him
a
bow
and
find
a
full
sheath
of
arrows
for
little
john
said
robin
joyfully
can
you
shoot
as
well
as
fence
with
the
staff
my
friend
i
have
hit
an
ash
twig
at
forty
yards
said
little
john
thus
chatting
pleasantly
the
band
turned
back
into
the
woodland
and
sought
their
secluded
dell
where
the
trees
were
the
thickest
the
moss
was
the
softest
and
a
secret
path
led
to
a
cave
at
once
a
retreat
and
a
stronghold
here
under
a
mighty
oak
they
found
the
rest
of
the
band
some
of
whom
had
come
in
with
a
brace
of
fat
does
and
here
they
built
a
ruddy
fire
and
sat
down
to
the
meat
and
ale
robin
hood
in
the
center
with
will
stutely
on
the
one
hand
and
little
john
on
the
other
and
robin
was
right
well
pleased
with
the
day
s
adventure
even
though
he
had
got
a
drubbing
for
sore
ribs
and
heads
will
heal
and
tis
not
every
day
that
one
can
find
a
recruit
as
stout
of
bone
and
true
of
soul
as
little
john
chapter
iii
how
robin
hood
turned
butcher
and
entered
the
sheriff
s
service
the
butcher
he
answered
jolly
robin
no
matter
where
i
do
dwell
for
a
butcher
am
i
and
to
nottingham
am
i
going
my
flesh
to
the
next
morning
the
weather
had
turned
ill
and
robin
hood
s
band
stayed
close
to
their
dry
and
friendly
cave
the
third
day
brought
a
diversion
in
the
shape
of
a
trap
by
a
roving
party
of
the
sheriff
s
men
a
fine
stag
had
been
struck
down
by
one
of
will
stutely
s
fellows
and
he
and
others
had
stepped
forth
from
the
covert
to
seize
it
when
twenty
bowmen
from
nottingham
appeared
at
the
end
of
the
glade
down
dropped
will
s
men
on
all
fours
barely
in
time
to
hear
a
shower
of
arrows
whistle
above
their
heads
then
from
behind
the
friendly
trees
they
sent
back
such
a
welcome
that
the
sheriff
s
men
deemed
it
prudent
not
to
tarry
in
their
steps
two
of
them
in
sooth
bore
back
unpleasant
wounds
in
their
shoulders
from
the
encounter
when
they
returned
to
town
the
sheriff
waxed
red
with
rage
what
he
gasped
do
my
men
fear
to
fight
this
robin
hood
face
to
face
would
that
i
could
get
him
within
my
reach
once
we
should
see
then
we
should
see
what
it
was
the
sheriff
would
see
he
did
not
state
but
he
was
to
have
his
wish
granted
in
short
space
and
you
and
i
will
see
how
he
profited
by
it
the
fourth
day
and
the
one
following
this
friendly
bout
little
john
was
missing
one
of
his
men
said
that
he
saw
him
talking
with
a
beggar
but
did
not
know
whither
they
had
gone
two
more
days
passed
robin
grew
uneasy
he
did
not
doubt
the
faith
of
little
john
but
he
was
fearful
lest
a
roving
band
of
foresters
had
captured
him
at
last
robin
could
not
remain
quiet
up
sprang
he
with
bow
and
arrows
and
a
short
sword
at
his
side
i
must
away
to
nottingham
town
my
men
he
cried
the
goodly
sheriff
has
long
desired
to
see
me
and
mayhap
he
can
tell
me
tidings
of
the
best
in
the
shire
meaning
little
john
others
of
the
band
besought
him
to
let
them
go
with
him
but
he
would
not
nay
he
said
smilingly
the
sheriff
and
i
are
too
good
friends
to
put
doubt
upon
our
meeting
but
tarry
ye
in
the
edge
of
the
wood
opposite
the
west
gate
of
the
town
and
ye
may
be
of
service
ere
so
saying
he
strode
forward
to
the
road
leading
to
nottingham
and
stood
as
before
looking
up
and
down
to
see
if
the
way
was
clear
back
at
a
bend
in
the
road
he
heard
a
rumbling
and
a
lumbering
when
up
drove
a
stout
butcher
whistling
gaily
and
driving
a
mare
that
sped
slowly
enough
because
of
the
weight
of
meat
with
which
the
cart
was
loaded
a
good
morrow
to
you
friend
hailed
robin
whence
come
you
and
where
go
you
with
your
load
of
meat
a
good
morrow
to
you
returned
the
butcher
civilly
enough
no
matter
where
i
dwell
i
am
but
a
simple
butcher
and
to
nottingham
am
i
going
my
flesh
to
sell
tis
fair
week
and
my
beef
and
mutton
should
fetch
a
fair
penny
and
he
laughed
loudly
at
his
jest
but
whence
come
you
a
yeoman
am
i
from
lockesley
town
men
call
me
robin
the
saints
forefend
that
you
should
treat
me
ill
said
the
butcher
in
terror
oft
have
i
heard
of
you
and
how
you
lighten
the
purses
of
the
fat
priests
and
knights
but
i
am
naught
but
a
poor
butcher
selling
this
load
of
meat
perchance
for
enough
to
pay
my
quarter
s
rest
you
my
friend
rest
you
quoth
robin
not
so
much
as
a
silver
penny
would
i
take
from
you
for
i
love
an
honest
saxon
face
and
a
fair
name
with
my
neighbors
but
i
would
strike
a
bargain
with
here
he
took
from
his
girdle
a
purse
and
continued
i
would
fain
be
a
butcher
this
day
and
sell
meat
at
nottingham
town
could
you
sell
me
your
meat
your
cart
your
mare
and
your
without
loss
for
five
marks
heaven
bless
ye
good
robin
cried
the
butcher
right
joyfully
that
can
i
and
he
leaped
down
forthwith
from
the
cart
and
handed
robin
the
reins
in
exchange
for
the
purse
one
moment
more
laughed
robin
we
must
e
en
change
garments
for
the
nonce
take
mine
and
scurry
home
quickly
lest
the
king
s
foresters
try
to
put
a
hole
through
this
lincoln
so
saying
he
donned
the
butcher
s
blouse
and
apron
and
climbing
into
the
cart
drove
merrily
down
the
road
to
the
town
when
he
came
to
nottingham
he
greeted
the
scowling
blithely
and
proceeded
to
the
boldly
he
led
his
shuffling
horse
to
the
place
where
the
butchers
had
their
stalls
he
had
no
notion
of
the
price
to
ask
for
his
meat
but
put
on
a
foolish
and
simple
air
as
he
called
aloud
his
wares
hark
ye
lasses
and
dames
hark
ye
good
meat
come
buy
come
buy
three
pen
orths
go
for
one
penny
and
a
kiss
is
good
say
i
now
when
the
folk
found
what
a
simple
butcher
he
was
they
crowded
around
his
cart
for
he
really
did
sell
three
times
as
much
for
one
penny
as
was
sold
by
the
other
butchers
and
one
or
two
with
twinkling
eyes
liked
his
comely
face
so
well
that
they
willingly
gave
boot
of
a
kiss
but
the
other
butchers
were
wroth
when
they
found
how
he
was
taking
their
trade
and
they
accordingly
put
their
heads
together
one
said
he
is
a
prodigal
and
has
sold
his
father
s
land
and
this
is
his
first
venture
in
another
said
he
is
a
thief
who
has
murdered
a
butcher
and
stolen
his
horse
and
robin
heard
these
sayings
but
only
laughed
merrily
and
sang
his
song
the
louder
his
made
the
people
laugh
also
and
crowd
round
his
cart
closely
shouting
uproariously
when
some
buxom
lass
submitted
to
be
kissed
then
the
butchers
saw
that
they
must
meet
craft
with
craft
and
they
said
to
him
come
brother
butcher
if
you
would
sell
meat
with
us
you
must
e
en
join
our
guild
and
stand
by
the
rules
of
our
we
dine
at
the
sheriff
s
mansion
said
another
and
you
must
take
one
of
our
accurst
of
his
heart
said
jolly
robin
that
a
butcher
will
deny
i
ll
go
with
you
my
brethren
true
and
as
fast
as
i
can
whereupon
having
sold
all
his
meat
he
left
his
horse
and
cart
in
charge
of
a
friendly
hostler
and
prepared
to
follow
his
mates
to
the
mansion
house
it
was
the
sheriff
s
custom
to
dine
various
guilds
of
the
trade
from
time
to
time
on
fair
days
for
he
got
a
pretty
profit
out
of
the
fees
they
paid
him
for
the
right
to
trade
in
the
the
sheriff
was
already
come
with
great
pomp
into
the
banqueting
room
when
robin
hood
and
three
or
four
butchers
entered
and
he
greeted
them
all
with
great
condescension
and
presently
the
whole
of
a
large
company
was
seated
at
a
table
groaning
beneath
the
good
cheer
of
the
feast
now
the
sheriff
bade
robin
sit
by
his
right
hand
at
the
head
of
the
board
for
one
or
two
butchers
had
whispered
to
the
official
that
fellow
is
a
right
mad
blade
who
yet
made
us
much
sport
he
sold
more
meat
for
one
penny
than
we
could
sell
for
three
and
he
gave
extra
weight
to
whatsoever
lass
would
buss
and
others
said
he
is
some
prodigal
who
knows
not
the
value
of
goods
and
may
be
plucked
by
a
shrewd
man
right
the
sheriff
was
will
to
pluck
a
prodigal
with
the
next
man
and
he
was
moreover
glad
to
have
a
guest
who
promised
to
enliven
the
feast
so
as
i
have
told
you
he
placed
robin
by
his
side
and
he
made
much
of
him
and
laughed
boisterously
at
his
jests
though
sooth
to
say
the
laugh
were
come
by
easily
for
robin
had
never
been
in
merrier
mood
and
his
quips
and
jests
soon
put
the
whole
table
at
a
roar
then
my
lord
bishop
of
hereford
came
in
last
of
all
to
say
a
ponderous
grace
and
take
his
seat
on
the
other
side
of
the
sheriff
the
prelate
s
fat
body
showing
up
in
goodly
contrast
to
the
other
s
lean
bones
after
grace
was
said
and
while
the
servants
clattered
in
with
the
meat
platters
robin
stood
up
and
said
an
amen
say
i
to
my
lord
bishop
s
thanks
how
now
my
fine
fellows
be
merry
and
drink
deep
for
the
shot
i
ll
pay
ere
i
go
my
way
though
it
cost
me
five
pounds
and
more
so
my
lords
and
gentlemen
all
spare
not
the
wine
but
fall
to
hear
hear
shouted
the
butchers
now
are
you
a
right
jolly
soul
quoth
the
sheriff
but
this
feast
is
mine
own
howbeit
you
must
have
many
a
head
of
horned
beasts
and
many
an
acre
of
broad
land
to
spend
from
your
purse
so
aye
that
have
i
returned
robin
his
eyes
all
a
twinkle
five
hundred
horned
beasts
have
i
and
my
brothers
and
none
of
them
have
we
been
able
to
sell
that
is
why
i
have
turned
butcher
but
i
know
not
the
trade
and
would
gladly
sell
the
whole
herd
an
i
could
find
a
at
this
the
sheriff
s
greed
gan
to
rise
since
this
fool
be
plucked
thought
he
why
should
not
he
do
the
plucking
five
hundred
beasts
say
you
he
queried
sharply
five
hundred
and
ten
fat
beasts
by
actual
count
that
i
would
sell
for
a
just
figure
aye
to
him
who
will
pay
me
in
right
money
would
i
sell
them
for
twenty
pieces
of
gold
is
that
too
much
to
ask
lording
was
there
ever
such
an
idiot
butcher
thought
the
sheriff
and
he
so
far
forgot
his
dignity
as
to
nudge
the
bishop
in
his
fat
ribs
nay
good
fellow
quoth
he
chuckling
i
am
always
ready
to
help
any
in
my
shire
an
you
can
not
find
a
buyer
for
your
herd
at
this
just
figure
i
will
e
en
buy
them
at
this
generosity
robin
was
quite
overcome
and
fell
to
praising
the
sheriff
to
the
skies
and
telling
him
that
he
should
not
have
cause
to
forget
the
kindness
tut
tut
said
the
sheriff
tis
naught
but
a
trade
drive
in
your
herd
tomorrow
to
the
and
you
shall
have
money
nay
excellence
said
robin
that
can
i
not
easily
do
for
they
are
grazing
in
scattered
fashion
but
they
are
over
near
gamewell
not
more
than
a
mile
therefrom
at
most
will
you
not
come
and
choose
your
own
beasts
tomorrow
aye
that
i
will
said
the
sheriff
his
cupidity
casting
his
caution
to
the
winds
tarry
with
me
over
night
and
i
will
go
with
you
in
the
this
was
a
poser
for
robin
since
he
liked
not
the
idea
of
staying
over
night
at
the
sheriff
s
house
he
had
hoped
to
appoint
a
for
the
other
but
now
saw
that
this
might
excite
doubt
he
looked
around
at
the
company
by
this
time
you
must
know
the
feast
had
progressed
far
and
the
butchers
were
deep
in
their
cups
the
sheriff
and
robin
had
talked
in
a
low
voice
and
my
lord
bishop
was
almost
asleep
agreed
said
robin
presently
and
the
words
were
no
sooner
out
of
his
mouth
than
the
door
opened
and
a
entered
bearing
tray
of
mulled
wine
at
sight
of
the
fellow
s
face
robin
gave
an
involuntary
start
of
surprise
which
was
instantly
checked
the
other
also
saw
him
stood
still
a
moment
and
as
if
forgetting
something
turned
about
and
left
the
hall
it
was
little
john
a
dozen
questions
flashed
across
robin
s
mind
and
he
could
find
answer
for
none
of
them
what
was
little
john
doing
in
the
sheriff
s
house
why
had
he
not
told
the
band
was
he
true
to
them
would
he
betray
him
but
these
questions
of
distrust
were
dismissed
from
robin
s
open
mind
as
soon
as
they
had
entered
he
knew
that
little
john
was
faithful
and
true
he
recovered
his
spirits
and
began
again
upon
a
vein
of
foolish
banter
for
the
amusement
of
the
sheriff
and
his
guests
all
being
now
merry
with
wine
a
song
one
of
them
shouted
and
the
cry
was
taken
up
round
the
table
robin
mounted
his
chair
and
trolled
forth
a
lass
and
a
butcher
of
nottingham
agreed
twixt
them
for
to
says
he
i
ll
give
ye
the
meat
fair
dame
and
ye
will
give
me
the
then
they
joined
in
the
chorus
amid
a
pounding
of
cups
upon
the
board
with
a
hey
and
a
ho
and
a
hey
nonny
no
a
butcher
of
nottingham
while
the
song
was
at
its
height
little
john
reappeared
with
other
servants
and
refilled
the
cups
he
came
up
to
robin
and
as
if
asking
him
if
he
would
have
more
wine
said
softly
meet
me
in
the
pantry
robin
nodded
and
sang
loudly
the
day
was
already
far
spent
and
presently
the
company
broke
up
with
many
hiccupy
bows
of
the
sheriff
and
little
notice
of
the
drowsy
bishop
when
the
company
was
dispersed
the
sheriff
bade
a
servant
show
robin
to
his
room
and
promised
to
see
him
at
breakfast
the
next
day
robin
kept
his
word
and
met
little
john
that
night
and
the
sheriff
next
day
but
little
john
has
been
doing
so
much
in
the
meantime
that
he
must
be
allowed
a
chapter
to
himself
so
let
us
turn
to
another
story
that
was
sung
of
in
the
ballads
of
olden
time
and
find
out
how
little
john
entered
the
sheriff
s
service
chapter
iv
how
little
john
entered
the
sheriff
s
service
list
and
hearken
gentlemen
all
ye
that
now
be
here
of
little
john
that
was
knight
good
mirth
ye
now
shall
hear
it
had
come
around
another
fair
day
at
nottingham
town
and
folk
crowded
there
by
all
the
gates
goods
of
many
kinds
were
displayed
in
gaily
colored
booths
and
at
every
a
free
show
was
in
progress
here
and
there
stages
had
been
erected
for
the
play
at
a
highly
popular
sport
there
was
a
fellow
one
eric
of
lincoln
who
was
thought
to
be
the
finest
man
with
the
staff
for
miles
around
his
feats
were
sung
about
in
ballads
through
all
the
shire
a
great
boaster
was
he
withal
and
he
strutted
about
on
one
of
these
corner
stages
and
vaunted
of
his
prowess
and
offered
to
crack
any
man
s
crown
for
a
shilling
several
had
tried
their
skill
with
eric
but
he
had
soon
sent
them
spinning
in
no
gentle
manner
amid
the
jeers
and
laughter
of
the
onlookers
a
sat
over
against
eric
s
stage
and
grinned
every
time
a
pate
was
cracked
he
was
an
uncouth
fellow
ragged
and
dirty
and
unshaven
eric
caught
sight
of
his
leering
face
at
one
of
his
boasts
for
there
was
a
lull
in
the
game
because
no
man
else
wanted
to
come
within
reach
of
eric
s
blows
eric
i
say
noticed
the
grinning
at
him
rather
impudently
and
turned
toward
him
sharply
how
now
you
dirty
villain
quoth
he
mend
your
manners
to
your
betters
or
by
our
lady
i
ll
dust
your
rags
for
the
still
grinned
i
am
always
ready
to
mend
my
manners
to
my
betters
said
he
but
i
am
afraid
you
can
not
teach
me
any
better
than
you
can
dust
my
come
up
come
up
roared
the
other
flourishing
his
staff
that
will
i
said
the
beggar
getting
up
slowly
and
with
difficulty
it
will
pleasure
me
hugely
to
take
a
braggart
down
a
notch
an
some
good
man
will
lend
me
a
stout
at
this
a
score
of
idlers
reached
him
their
staves
being
ready
enough
to
see
another
man
have
his
head
cracked
even
if
they
wished
to
save
their
own
and
he
took
the
stoutest
and
heaviest
of
all
he
made
a
sorry
enough
figure
as
he
climbed
awkwardly
upon
the
stage
but
when
he
had
gained
it
he
towered
full
half
a
head
above
the
other
for
all
his
awkwardness
nathless
he
held
his
stick
so
clumsily
that
the
crowd
laughed
in
great
glee
now
each
man
took
his
place
and
looked
the
other
up
and
down
watching
warily
for
an
opening
only
a
moment
stood
they
thus
for
eric
intent
on
teaching
this
rash
beggar
a
lesson
and
sweeping
him
speedily
off
the
stage
launched
forth
boldly
and
gave
the
other
a
sounding
crack
on
the
shoulder
the
beggar
danced
about
and
made
as
though
he
would
drop
his
staff
from
very
pain
while
the
crowd
roared
and
eric
raised
himself
for
another
crushing
blow
but
just
then
the
awkward
beggar
came
to
life
straightening
himself
like
a
flash
he
dealt
eric
a
blow
the
like
of
which
he
had
never
before
seen
down
went
the
boaster
to
the
floor
with
a
sounding
thump
and
the
fickle
people
yelled
and
laughed
themselves
purple
for
it
was
a
new
sight
to
see
eric
of
lincoln
eating
dust
but
he
was
up
again
almost
as
soon
as
he
had
fallen
and
right
quickly
retreated
to
his
own
ringside
to
gather
his
wits
and
watch
for
an
opening
he
saw
instantly
that
he
had
no
easy
antagonist
and
he
came
in
cautiously
this
time
and
now
those
who
stood
around
saw
the
merriest
game
of
that
was
ever
played
inside
the
walls
of
nottingham
town
both
men
were
on
their
guard
and
fenced
with
fine
skill
being
well
matched
in
prowess
again
and
again
did
eric
seek
to
force
an
opening
under
the
other
s
guard
and
just
as
often
were
his
blows
parried
the
beggar
stood
sturdily
in
his
tracks
contenting
himself
with
beating
off
the
attack
for
a
long
time
their
blows
met
like
the
steady
crackling
of
some
huge
forest
fire
and
eric
strove
to
be
wary
for
he
now
knew
that
the
other
had
no
mean
wits
or
mettle
but
he
grew
right
mad
at
last
and
began
to
send
down
blows
so
fierce
and
fast
that
you
would
have
sworn
a
great
was
pounding
on
the
shingles
over
your
head
yet
he
never
so
much
as
entered
the
tall
beggar
s
guard
then
at
last
the
stranger
saw
his
chance
and
changed
his
tune
of
fighting
with
one
upward
stroke
he
sent
eric
s
staff
whirling
through
the
air
with
another
he
tapped
eric
on
the
head
and
with
a
third
broad
swing
ere
the
other
could
recover
himself
he
swept
him
clear
off
the
stage
much
as
you
would
brush
a
fly
off
the
window
pane
now
the
people
danced
and
shouted
and
made
so
much
ado
that
the
left
their
stalls
and
others
came
running
from
every
direction
the
victory
of
the
queer
beggar
made
him
immensely
popular
eric
had
been
a
great
bully
and
many
had
suffered
defeat
and
insult
at
his
hands
so
the
ragged
stranger
found
money
and
food
and
drink
everywhere
at
his
disposal
and
he
feasted
right
comfortably
till
the
afternoon
then
a
long
bow
contest
came
on
and
to
it
the
beggar
went
with
some
of
his
new
friends
it
was
held
in
the
same
arena
that
robin
had
formerly
entered
and
again
the
sheriff
and
lords
and
ladies
graced
the
scene
with
their
presence
while
the
people
crowded
to
their
places
when
the
archers
had
stepped
forward
the
herald
rose
and
proclaimed
the
rules
of
the
game
how
that
each
man
should
shoot
three
shots
and
to
him
who
shot
best
the
prize
of
a
yoke
of
fat
steers
should
belong
a
dozen
bowmen
were
there
and
among
them
some
of
the
best
fellows
in
the
forester
s
and
sheriff
s
companies
down
at
the
end
of
the
line
towered
the
tall
who
must
needs
twang
a
with
the
best
of
them
the
sheriff
noted
his
queer
figure
and
asked
who
is
that
ragged
fellow
tis
he
that
hath
but
now
so
soundly
cracked
the
crown
of
eric
of
lincoln
was
the
reply
the
shooting
presently
began
and
the
targets
soon
showed
a
fine
reckoning
last
of
all
came
the
beggar
s
turn
by
your
leave
he
said
loudly
i
d
like
it
well
to
shoot
with
any
other
man
here
present
at
a
mark
of
my
own
and
he
strode
down
the
lists
with
a
slender
peeled
sapling
which
he
stuck
upright
in
the
ground
there
said
he
is
a
right
good
mark
will
any
man
try
it
but
not
an
archer
would
risk
his
reputation
on
so
small
a
target
whereupon
the
beggar
drew
his
bow
with
seeming
carelessness
and
split
the
wand
with
his
shaft
long
live
the
beggar
yelled
the
bystanders
the
sheriff
swore
a
full
great
oath
and
said
this
man
is
the
best
archer
that
ever
yet
i
and
he
beckoned
to
him
and
asked
him
how
now
good
fellow
what
is
your
name
and
in
what
country
were
you
born
in
holderness
i
was
born
the
man
replied
men
call
me
reynold
you
are
a
sturdy
fellow
reynold
greenleaf
and
deserve
better
apparel
than
that
you
wear
at
present
will
you
enter
my
service
i
will
give
you
twenty
marks
a
year
above
your
living
and
three
good
suits
of
three
good
suits
say
you
then
right
gladly
will
i
enter
your
service
for
my
back
has
been
bare
this
many
a
long
then
reynold
turned
him
about
to
the
crowd
and
shouted
hark
ye
good
people
i
have
entered
the
sheriff
s
service
and
need
not
the
yoke
of
steers
for
prize
so
take
them
for
yourselves
to
feast
at
this
the
crowd
shouted
more
merrily
than
ever
and
threw
their
caps
high
into
the
air
and
none
so
popular
a
man
had
come
to
nottingham
town
in
many
a
long
day
as
this
same
reynold
greenleaf
now
you
may
have
guessed
by
this
time
who
reynold
greenleaf
really
was
so
i
shall
tell
you
that
he
was
none
other
than
little
john
and
forth
went
he
to
the
sheriff
s
house
and
entered
his
service
but
it
was
a
sorry
day
for
the
sheriff
when
he
got
his
new
man
for
little
john
winked
his
shrewd
eye
and
said
softly
to
himself
by
my
faith
i
shall
be
the
worst
servant
to
him
that
ever
yet
had
he
two
days
passed
by
little
john
it
must
be
confessed
did
not
make
a
good
servant
he
insisted
upon
eating
the
sheriff
s
best
bread
and
drinking
his
best
wine
so
that
the
steward
waxed
wroth
nathless
the
sheriff
held
him
in
high
esteem
and
made
great
talk
of
taking
him
along
on
the
next
hunting
trip
it
was
now
the
day
of
the
banquet
to
the
butchers
about
which
we
have
already
heard
the
banquet
hall
you
must
know
was
not
in
the
main
house
but
connected
with
it
by
a
corridor
all
the
servants
were
bustling
about
making
preparations
for
the
feast
save
only
little
john
who
must
needs
lie
abed
the
greater
part
of
the
day
but
he
presented
himself
at
last
when
the
dinner
was
half
over
and
being
desirous
of
seeing
the
guests
for
himself
he
went
into
the
hall
with
the
other
servants
to
pass
the
wine
first
however
i
am
afraid
that
some
of
the
wine
passed
his
own
lips
while
he
went
down
the
corridor
when
he
entered
the
banqueting
hall
whom
should
he
see
but
robin
hood
himself
we
can
imagine
the
start
of
surprise
felt
by
each
of
these
bold
fellows
upon
seeing
the
other
in
such
strange
company
but
they
kept
their
secrets
as
we
have
seen
and
arranged
to
meet
each
other
that
same
night
meanwhile
the
proud
sheriff
little
knew
that
he
harbored
the
two
chief
outlaws
of
the
whole
countryside
beneath
his
roof
after
the
feast
was
over
and
night
was
beginning
to
advance
little
john
felt
faint
of
stomach
and
remembered
him
that
he
had
eaten
nothing
all
that
day
back
went
he
to
the
pantry
to
see
what
eatables
were
laid
by
but
there
locking
up
the
stores
for
the
night
stood
the
fat
steward
good
sir
steward
said
little
john
give
me
to
dine
for
it
is
long
for
greenleaf
to
be
the
steward
looked
grimly
at
him
and
rattled
the
keys
at
his
girdle
sirrah
quoth
he
tis
late
in
the
day
to
be
talking
of
eating
since
you
have
waited
thus
long
to
be
hungry
you
can
e
en
take
your
appetite
back
to
bed
now
by
mine
appetite
that
will
i
not
do
cried
little
john
your
own
paunch
of
fat
would
be
enough
for
any
bear
to
sleep
on
through
the
winter
but
my
stomach
craves
food
and
food
it
shall
have
saying
this
he
brushed
past
the
steward
and
tried
the
door
but
it
was
locked
fast
whereat
the
fat
steward
chuckled
and
jangled
his
keys
again
then
was
little
john
right
mad
and
he
brought
down
his
huge
fist
on
the
with
a
blow
that
shivered
an
opening
you
could
thrust
your
hand
into
little
john
stooped
and
peered
through
the
hole
to
see
what
food
lay
within
reach
when
crack
went
the
steward
s
keys
upon
his
crown
and
the
worthy
danced
around
him
playing
a
tattoo
that
made
little
john
s
ears
ring
at
this
he
turned
upon
the
steward
and
gave
him
such
a
rap
that
his
back
went
nigh
in
two
and
over
went
the
fat
fellow
rolling
on
the
floor
lie
there
quoth
little
john
till
ye
find
strength
to
go
to
bed
meanwhile
i
must
be
about
my
and
he
kicked
open
the
buttery
door
without
ceremony
and
brought
to
light
a
venison
pasty
and
cold
roast
pheasant
goodly
sights
to
a
hungry
man
placing
these
down
on
a
convenient
shelf
he
fell
to
with
right
good
will
so
little
john
ate
and
drank
as
much
as
he
would
now
the
sheriff
had
in
his
kitchen
a
cook
a
stout
man
and
bold
who
heard
the
rumpus
and
came
in
to
see
how
the
land
lay
there
sat
little
john
eating
away
for
dear
life
while
the
fat
steward
was
rolled
under
the
table
like
a
bundle
of
rags
i
make
my
vow
said
the
cook
you
are
a
shrewd
hind
to
dwell
thus
in
a
household
and
ask
thus
to
so
saying
he
laid
aside
his
spit
and
drew
a
good
sword
that
hung
at
his
side
i
make
my
vow
said
little
john
you
are
a
bold
man
and
hardy
to
come
thus
between
me
and
my
meat
so
defend
yourself
and
see
that
you
prove
the
better
and
he
drew
his
own
sword
and
crossed
weapons
with
the
cook
then
back
and
forth
they
clashed
with
sullen
sound
the
old
ballad
which
tells
of
their
fight
says
that
they
thought
nothing
for
to
flee
but
stiffly
for
to
stand
there
they
fought
sore
together
two
miles
away
and
more
but
neither
might
the
other
harm
for
the
space
of
a
full
hour
i
make
my
vow
cried
little
john
you
are
the
best
swordsman
that
ever
yet
i
saw
what
say
you
to
resting
a
space
and
eating
and
drinking
good
health
with
me
then
we
may
fall
to
again
with
the
agreed
said
the
cook
who
loved
good
fare
as
well
as
a
good
fight
and
they
both
laid
by
their
swords
and
fell
to
the
food
with
hearty
will
the
venison
pasty
soon
disappeared
and
the
roast
pheasant
flew
at
as
lively
a
rate
as
ever
the
bird
itself
had
sped
then
the
warriors
rested
a
space
and
patted
their
stomachs
and
smiled
across
at
each
other
like
bosom
friends
for
a
man
when
he
as
dined
looks
out
pleasantly
upon
the
world
and
now
good
reynold
greenleaf
said
the
cook
we
may
as
well
settle
this
brave
fight
we
have
in
a
true
saying
rejoined
the
other
but
first
tell
me
friend
for
i
protest
you
are
my
friend
henceforth
what
is
the
score
we
have
to
settle
naught
save
who
can
handle
the
sword
best
said
the
cook
by
my
troth
i
had
thought
to
carve
you
like
a
capon
ere
and
i
had
long
since
thought
to
shave
your
ears
replied
little
john
this
bout
we
can
settle
in
right
good
time
but
just
now
i
and
my
master
have
need
of
you
and
you
can
turn
your
stout
blade
to
better
service
than
that
of
the
whose
service
would
that
be
asked
the
cook
mine
answered
a
butcher
entering
the
room
and
i
am
robin
chapter
v
how
the
sheriff
lost
three
good
servants
and
found
them
again
make
good
cheer
said
robin
hood
sheriff
for
charity
and
for
the
love
of
little
john
thy
life
is
granted
thee
the
cook
gasped
in
amazement
this
robin
hood
and
under
the
sheriff
s
very
roof
now
by
my
troth
you
are
a
brave
fellow
he
said
i
have
heard
great
tales
of
your
prowess
and
the
half
has
not
been
told
but
who
might
this
tall
slasher
be
men
do
call
me
little
john
good
then
little
john
or
reynold
greenleaf
i
like
you
well
on
my
honor
as
much
the
miller
s
son
and
you
too
bold
robin
hood
an
you
take
me
i
will
enter
your
service
right
spoken
like
a
stout
man
said
robin
seizing
him
by
the
hand
but
i
must
back
to
my
own
bed
lest
some
sleepy
warden
stumble
upon
me
and
i
be
forced
to
run
him
through
lucky
for
you
twain
that
wine
flowed
so
freely
in
the
house
else
the
noise
of
your
combat
would
have
brought
other
onlookers
besides
robin
hood
now
if
ye
would
flee
the
house
i
will
join
you
in
the
good
greenwood
but
good
master
said
the
cook
you
would
not
stay
here
over
night
verily
it
is
running
your
head
into
a
noose
come
with
us
the
sheriff
has
set
strict
watch
on
all
the
gates
since
tis
fair
week
but
i
know
the
warden
at
the
west
gate
and
could
bring
us
through
safely
you
will
be
nay
that
will
i
not
laughed
robin
for
i
shall
go
through
with
no
less
escort
than
the
sheriff
himself
now
do
you
little
john
and
do
you
much
the
miller
s
son
go
right
speedily
in
the
borders
of
the
wood
you
will
find
my
merry
men
tell
them
to
kill
two
fine
harts
against
eve
for
we
shall
have
great
company
and
lordly
and
robin
left
them
as
suddenly
as
he
had
come
comrade
then
said
little
john
we
may
as
well
bid
the
sheriff
s
roof
farewell
but
ere
we
go
it
would
seem
a
true
pity
to
fail
to
take
such
of
the
sheriff
s
silver
plate
as
will
cause
us
to
remember
him
and
also
grace
our
special
tis
well
said
indeed
quoth
the
cook
thereupon
they
got
a
great
sack
and
filled
it
with
silver
plate
from
the
shelves
where
it
would
not
at
once
be
missed
and
they
swung
the
sack
between
them
and
away
they
went
out
of
the
house
out
of
the
town
and
into
the
friendly
shelter
of
sherwood
forest
the
next
morning
the
servants
were
late
astir
in
the
sheriff
s
house
the
steward
awoke
from
a
heavy
sleep
but
his
cracked
head
was
still
in
such
a
whirl
that
he
could
not
have
sworn
whether
the
sheriff
had
ever
owned
so
much
as
one
silver
dish
so
the
theft
went
undiscovered
for
the
nonce
robin
hood
met
the
sheriff
at
breakfast
when
his
host
soon
spoke
of
what
was
uppermost
in
his
heart
the
purchase
of
the
fine
herd
of
cattle
near
gamewell
twas
clear
that
a
vision
of
them
purchased
for
twenty
paltry
gold
pieces
had
been
with
him
all
through
the
night
in
his
dreams
and
robin
again
appeared
such
a
silly
fellow
that
the
sheriff
saw
no
need
of
dissembling
but
said
that
he
was
ready
to
start
at
once
to
look
at
the
herd
accordingly
they
set
forth
robin
in
his
little
butcher
s
cart
behind
the
lean
mare
and
the
sheriff
mounted
on
a
horse
out
of
nottingham
town
through
gates
open
wide
they
proceeded
and
took
the
hill
road
leading
through
sherwood
forest
and
as
they
went
on
and
plunged
deeper
among
the
trees
robin
whistled
blithely
and
sang
snatches
of
tunes
why
are
you
so
gay
fellow
said
the
sheriff
for
sooth
to
say
the
silence
of
the
woods
was
making
him
uneasy
i
am
whistling
to
keep
my
courage
up
replied
robin
what
is
there
to
fear
when
you
have
the
sheriff
of
nottingham
beside
you
quoth
the
other
pompously
robin
scratched
his
head
they
do
say
that
robin
hood
and
his
men
care
little
for
the
sheriff
he
said
pooh
said
the
sheriff
i
would
not
give
for
their
lives
if
i
could
once
lay
hands
upon
and
he
snapped
his
fingers
angrily
but
robin
hood
himself
was
on
this
very
road
the
last
time
i
came
to
town
said
the
other
the
sheriff
started
at
the
crackling
of
a
twig
under
his
horse
s
feet
and
looked
around
did
you
see
him
he
asked
aye
that
did
i
he
wanted
the
use
of
this
mare
and
cart
to
drive
to
nottingham
he
said
he
would
fain
turn
butcher
but
see
as
he
spoke
he
came
to
a
turn
in
the
road
and
there
before
them
stood
a
herd
of
the
king
s
deer
feeding
robin
pointed
to
them
and
continued
there
is
my
herd
of
cattle
good
master
sheriff
how
do
you
like
them
are
they
not
fat
and
fair
to
see
the
sheriff
drew
rein
quickly
now
fellow
quoth
he
i
would
i
were
well
out
of
this
forest
for
i
care
not
to
see
such
herds
as
these
or
such
faces
as
yours
choose
your
own
way
therefore
whoever
you
be
and
let
me
go
nay
laughed
robin
seizing
the
sheriff
s
bridle
i
have
been
at
too
much
pains
to
cultivate
your
company
to
forego
it
now
so
easily
besides
i
wish
you
to
meet
some
of
my
friends
and
dine
with
me
since
you
have
so
lately
entertained
me
at
your
so
saying
he
clapped
a
horn
on
his
lips
and
winded
three
merry
notes
the
deer
bounded
away
and
before
the
last
of
them
was
seen
there
came
a
running
and
a
rustling
and
out
from
behind
covert
and
tree
came
full
twoscore
of
men
clad
in
lincoln
green
and
bearing
good
yew
bows
in
their
hands
and
short
swords
at
their
sides
up
they
ran
to
robin
hood
and
doffed
their
caps
to
him
respectfully
while
the
sheriff
sat
still
from
very
amazement
welcome
to
the
greenwood
said
one
of
the
leaders
bending
the
knee
with
mock
reverence
before
the
sheriff
the
sheriff
glared
it
was
little
john
woe
the
worth
reynold
greenleaf
he
said
you
have
betrayed
me
i
make
my
vow
said
little
john
that
you
are
to
blame
master
i
was
misserved
of
my
dinner
when
i
was
at
your
house
but
we
shall
set
you
down
to
a
feast
we
hope
you
will
well
spoken
little
john
said
robin
hood
take
you
his
bridle
and
let
us
do
honor
to
the
guest
who
has
come
to
feast
with
then
turning
abruptly
the
whole
company
plunged
into
the
heart
of
the
forest
after
twisting
and
turning
till
the
sheriff
s
bewildered
head
sat
dizzily
upon
his
shoulders
the
greenwood
men
passed
through
a
narrow
alley
amid
the
trees
which
led
to
a
goodly
open
space
flanked
by
oaks
under
the
largest
of
these
a
pleasant
fire
was
crackling
and
near
it
two
fine
harts
lay
ready
for
cooking
around
the
blaze
were
gathered
another
company
of
yeomen
quite
as
large
as
that
which
came
with
robin
hood
up
sprang
they
as
the
latter
advanced
and
saluted
their
leader
with
deference
but
with
hearty
gladness
to
see
him
back
again
that
merry
wag
will
stutely
was
in
command
and
when
he
saw
the
palefaced
sheriff
being
led
in
like
any
culprit
he
took
his
cloak
and
laid
it
humbly
upon
the
ground
and
besought
the
sheriff
to
alight
upon
it
as
the
ground
of
sherwood
was
unused
to
such
dignitaries
bestir
yourselves
good
fellows
cried
robin
hood
and
while
our
new
cook
whom
i
see
with
us
is
preparing
a
feast
worthy
of
our
high
guest
let
us
have
a
few
games
to
do
him
honor
then
while
the
whole
glade
was
filled
with
the
savory
smell
of
roasting
venison
and
fat
capons
and
brown
pasties
warmed
beside
the
blaze
and
mulled
wine
sent
forth
a
cordial
fragrance
robin
hood
placed
the
sheriff
upon
a
knoll
beneath
the
largest
oak
and
sat
himself
down
by
him
first
stepped
forward
several
pairs
of
men
armed
with
the
the
widow
s
sons
among
them
and
so
skilfully
did
they
thrust
and
parry
and
beat
down
guards
that
the
sheriff
who
loved
a
good
game
as
well
as
any
man
clapped
his
hands
forgetting
where
he
was
and
shouted
well
struck
well
struck
never
have
i
seen
such
blows
at
all
the
fairs
of
nottingham
then
the
best
archers
of
the
band
set
up
a
small
wand
at
eightscore
paces
distant
and
thereon
they
affixed
a
wreath
of
green
and
the
archers
began
to
shoot
and
he
who
shot
not
through
the
garland
without
disturbing
its
leaves
and
tendrils
was
fain
to
submit
to
a
good
sound
buffet
from
little
john
but
right
cunning
was
the
shooting
for
the
men
had
spent
a
certain
time
in
daily
practice
and
many
were
the
shafts
which
sped
daintily
through
the
circle
nathless
now
and
again
some
luckless
fellow
would
shoot
awry
and
would
be
sent
winding
from
a
long
arm
blow
from
the
tall
lieutenant
while
the
glade
roared
with
laughter
and
none
more
hearty
a
guffaw
was
given
than
came
from
the
sheriff
s
own
throat
for
the
spirit
of
the
greenwood
was
upon
him
but
presently
his
high
mood
was
dashed
the
company
sat
down
to
meat
and
the
guest
was
treated
to
two
more
disturbing
surprise
the
cook
came
forward
to
serve
the
food
when
the
sheriff
beheld
in
him
his
own
former
servant
and
one
whom
he
supposed
was
at
the
moment
in
the
scullery
at
nottingham
much
the
miller
s
son
grinned
by
way
of
answer
to
the
sheriff
s
amazement
and
served
the
plates
and
placed
them
before
the
party
then
did
the
sheriff
gasp
and
fairly
choke
with
rage
the
service
was
his
own
silverware
from
the
mansion
house
you
rascals
you
rogues
he
spluttered
was
it
not
enough
to
defraud
me
out
of
three
of
my
servants
that
you
must
also
rob
me
of
my
best
silver
service
nay
by
my
life
but
i
will
not
touch
your
food
but
robin
hood
bade
him
pause
gramercy
quoth
he
servants
come
and
go
in
merry
england
and
so
does
service
the
platters
are
but
used
to
do
your
worship
honor
and
as
for
your
life
it
is
forfeit
to
your
eagerness
to
buy
my
herd
of
cattle
so
cheaply
now
sit
you
down
again
and
make
good
cheer
sheriff
for
charity
and
for
the
love
of
little
john
your
life
is
granted
you
so
the
sheriff
sat
him
down
again
with
the
best
face
he
could
assume
and
soon
the
cook
s
viands
were
disappearing
down
his
gullet
as
rapidly
as
the
next
man
s
and
they
feasted
royally
and
clinked
each
other
s
cups
until
the
sun
had
ceased
to
print
the
pattern
of
the
leaves
upon
the
forest
carpet
then
the
sheriff
arose
and
said
i
thank
you
robin
hood
butcher
and
you
little
john
beggar
and
you
much
cook
and
all
you
good
men
who
have
entertained
me
in
sherwood
so
well
promises
i
make
not
as
to
how
i
shall
requite
you
when
next
you
come
to
nottingham
for
i
am
in
the
king
s
service
so
for
the
present
the
score
rests
with
you
but
the
shadows
grow
long
and
i
must
away
if
you
will
be
pleased
to
pilot
me
to
the
then
robin
hood
and
all
his
men
arose
and
drank
the
sheriff
s
health
and
robin
said
if
you
must
needs
go
at
once
we
will
not
detain
you
except
that
you
have
forgotten
two
what
may
they
be
asked
the
sheriff
while
his
heart
sank
within
him
you
forget
that
you
came
with
me
to
buy
a
herd
of
horned
beasts
likewise
that
he
who
dines
at
the
greenwood
inn
must
pay
the
the
sheriff
fidgeted
like
a
small
boy
who
has
forgotten
his
lesson
nay
i
have
but
a
small
sum
with
me
he
began
apologetically
what
is
that
sum
gossip
questioned
little
john
for
my
own
wage
should
also
come
out
of
it
and
mine
said
much
and
mine
smiled
robin
the
sheriff
caught
his
breath
by
my
troth
are
all
these
silver
dishes
worth
anything
the
outlaws
roared
heartily
at
this
i
ll
tell
you
what
it
is
worship
said
robin
we
three
rascally
servants
will
compound
our
back
wages
for
those
plates
and
we
will
keep
the
herd
of
cattle
free
for
our
own
use
and
the
king
s
but
this
little
tavern
bill
should
be
settled
now
what
sum
have
you
about
you
i
have
only
those
twenty
pieces
of
gold
and
twenty
others
said
the
sheriff
and
well
it
was
that
he
told
the
truth
for
once
for
robin
said
count
it
little
little
john
turned
the
sheriff
s
wallet
inside
out
tis
true
enough
he
said
then
you
shall
pay
no
more
than
twenty
pieces
for
your
entertainment
excellence
decreed
robin
speak
i
soothly
men
of
greenwood
good
echoed
the
others
the
sheriff
should
swear
by
his
patron
saint
that
he
will
not
molest
us
said
will
stutely
and
his
addition
was
carried
unanimously
so
be
it
then
cried
little
john
approaching
the
sheriff
now
swear
by
your
life
and
your
patron
saint
i
will
swear
it
by
george
who
is
patron
of
us
all
said
the
sheriff
vigorously
that
i
will
never
disturb
or
distress
the
outlaws
in
but
let
me
catch
any
of
you
of
sherwood
thought
he
to
himself
then
the
twenty
pieces
of
gold
were
paid
over
and
the
sheriff
once
more
prepared
to
depart
never
had
we
so
worshipful
a
guest
before
said
robin
and
as
the
new
moon
is
beginning
to
silver
the
leaves
i
shall
bear
you
company
myself
for
part
of
the
way
twas
i
who
brought
you
into
the
nay
i
protest
against
your
going
needlessly
far
said
sheriff
but
i
protest
that
i
am
loath
to
lose
your
company
replied
robin
the
next
time
i
may
not
be
so
and
he
took
the
sheriff
s
horse
by
the
bridle
rein
and
led
him
through
the
lane
and
by
many
a
thicket
till
the
main
road
was
reached
now
fare
you
well
good
sheriff
he
said
and
when
next
you
think
to
despoil
a
poor
prodigal
remember
the
herd
you
would
have
bought
over
against
gamewell
and
when
next
you
employ
a
servant
make
certain
that
he
is
not
employing
so
saying
he
smote
the
nag
s
haunch
and
off
went
the
sheriff
upon
the
road
to
nottingham
and
that
is
how
you
will
find
from
many
ballads
that
came
to
be
sung
at
the
sheriff
s
expense
and
which
are
known
even
to
the
present
day
that
i
say
is
how
the
sheriff
lost
three
good
servants
and
found
them
again
chapter
vi
how
robin
hood
met
will
scarlet
the
youngster
was
clothed
in
scarlet
red
in
scarlet
fine
and
gay
and
he
did
frisk
it
o
er
the
plain
and
chanted
a
roundelay
one
fine
morning
soon
after
the
proud
sheriff
had
been
brought
to
grief
robin
hood
and
little
john
went
strolling
down
a
path
through
the
wood
it
was
not
far
from
the
foot
bridge
where
they
had
fought
their
memorable
battle
and
by
common
impulse
they
directed
their
steps
to
the
brook
to
quench
their
thirst
and
rest
them
in
the
cool
bushes
the
morning
gave
promise
of
a
hot
day
the
road
even
by
the
brook
was
dusty
so
the
cooling
stream
was
very
pleasing
and
grateful
to
their
senses
on
each
side
of
them
beyond
the
dusty
highway
stretched
out
broad
fields
of
tender
young
corn
on
the
yon
side
of
the
fields
uprose
the
sturdy
oaks
and
beeches
and
ashes
of
the
forest
while
at
their
feet
modest
violets
peeped
out
shyly
and
greeted
the
loiterers
with
an
odor
which
made
the
heart
glad
over
on
the
far
side
of
the
brook
in
a
tiny
bay
floated
three
and
from
amid
some
clover
blossoms
on
the
bank
an
industrious
bee
rose
with
the
hum
of
busy
contentment
it
was
a
day
so
brimful
of
quiet
joy
that
the
two
friends
lay
flat
on
their
backs
gazing
up
at
the
scurrying
clouds
and
neither
caring
to
break
the
silence
presently
they
heard
some
one
coming
up
the
road
whistling
gaily
as
though
he
owned
the
whole
world
and
twas
but
made
to
whistle
in
anon
he
chanted
a
roundelay
with
a
merry
note
by
my
troth
a
gay
bird
quoth
robin
raising
up
on
his
elbow
let
us
lie
still
and
trust
that
his
purse
is
not
as
light
as
his
so
they
lay
still
and
in
a
minute
more
up
came
a
smart
stranger
dressed
in
scarlet
and
silk
and
wearing
a
jaunty
hat
with
a
curling
cock
feather
in
it
his
whole
costume
was
of
scarlet
from
the
feather
to
the
silk
hosen
on
his
legs
a
goodly
sword
hung
at
his
side
its
scabbard
all
embossed
with
tilting
knights
and
weeping
ladies
his
hair
was
long
and
yellow
and
hung
clustering
about
his
shoulders
for
all
the
world
like
a
schoolgirl
s
and
he
bore
himself
with
as
mincing
a
gait
as
the
pertest
of
them
little
john
clucked
his
teeth
drolly
at
this
sight
by
my
troth
a
gay
bird
he
said
echoing
the
other
s
words
then
added
but
not
so
bad
a
build
for
all
his
prettiness
look
you
those
calves
and
thighs
are
well
rounded
and
straight
the
arms
for
all
that
cloak
hang
stoutly
from
full
shoulders
i
warrant
you
the
fop
can
use
his
dainty
sword
right
well
on
nay
retorted
robin
he
is
naught
but
a
ladies
man
from
court
my
gainst
a
plugged
shilling
that
he
would
run
and
bellow
lustily
at
sight
of
a
stay
you
behind
this
bush
and
i
will
soon
get
some
rare
sport
out
of
him
belike
his
silk
purse
may
contain
more
pennies
than
the
law
allows
to
one
man
in
sherwood
or
so
saying
robin
hood
stepped
forth
briskly
from
the
covert
and
planted
himself
in
the
way
of
the
scarlet
stranger
the
latter
had
walked
so
slowly
that
he
was
scarce
come
to
their
and
now
on
beholding
robin
he
neither
slackened
nor
quickened
his
pace
but
sauntered
idly
straight
ahead
looking
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
with
the
finest
air
in
the
world
but
never
once
at
robin
hold
quoth
the
outlaw
what
mean
ye
by
running
thus
over
a
wayfarer
rough
shod
wherefore
should
i
hold
good
fellow
said
the
stranger
in
a
smooth
voice
and
looking
at
robin
for
the
first
time
because
i
bid
you
to
replied
robin
and
who
may
you
be
asked
the
other
as
coolly
as
you
please
what
my
name
is
matters
not
said
robin
but
know
that
i
am
a
public
and
equalizer
of
shillings
if
your
purse
have
more
than
a
just
number
of
shillings
or
pence
i
must
e
en
lighten
it
somewhat
for
there
are
many
worthy
people
round
about
these
borders
who
have
less
than
the
just
amount
wherefore
sweet
gentleman
i
pray
you
hand
over
your
purse
without
more
ado
that
i
may
judge
of
its
weight
in
proper
the
other
smiled
as
sweetly
as
though
a
lady
were
paying
him
a
compliment
you
are
a
droll
fellow
he
said
calmly
your
speech
amuses
me
mightily
pray
continue
if
you
have
not
done
for
i
am
in
no
hurry
this
i
have
said
all
with
my
tongue
that
is
needful
retorted
robin
beginning
to
grow
red
under
the
collar
nathless
i
have
other
arguments
which
may
not
be
so
pleasing
to
your
dainty
skin
prithee
stand
and
deliver
i
promise
to
deal
fairly
with
the
said
the
stranger
with
a
little
shrug
of
his
shoulders
i
am
deeply
sorrowful
that
i
can
not
show
my
purse
to
every
rough
lout
that
asks
to
see
it
but
i
really
could
not
as
i
have
further
need
of
it
myself
and
every
farthing
it
contains
wherefore
pray
stand
nay
that
will
i
not
and
twill
go
the
harder
with
you
if
you
do
not
yield
at
good
fellow
said
the
other
gently
have
i
not
heard
all
your
speech
with
patience
now
that
is
all
i
promised
to
do
my
conscience
is
salved
and
i
must
go
on
my
way
he
caroled
making
as
though
to
depart
hold
i
say
quoth
robin
hotly
for
he
knew
how
little
john
must
be
chuckling
at
this
from
behind
the
bushes
hold
i
say
else
i
shall
have
to
bloody
those
fair
locks
of
yours
and
he
swung
his
threateningly
alas
moaned
the
stranger
shaking
his
head
the
pity
of
it
all
now
i
shall
have
to
run
this
fellow
through
with
my
sword
and
i
hoped
to
be
a
peaceable
man
henceforth
and
sighing
deeply
he
drew
his
shining
blade
and
stood
on
guard
put
by
your
weapon
said
robin
it
is
too
pretty
a
piece
of
steel
to
get
cracked
with
common
oak
cudgel
and
that
is
what
would
happen
on
the
first
pass
i
made
at
you
get
you
a
stick
like
mine
out
of
yon
undergrowth
and
we
will
fight
fairly
man
to
the
stranger
thought
a
moment
with
his
usual
slowness
and
eyed
robin
from
head
to
foot
then
he
unbuckled
his
scabbard
laid
it
and
the
sword
aside
and
walked
deliberately
over
to
the
oak
thicket
choosing
from
among
the
shoots
and
saplings
he
found
a
stout
little
tree
to
his
liking
when
he
laid
hold
of
it
without
stopping
to
cut
it
and
gave
a
tug
up
it
came
root
and
all
as
though
it
were
a
stalk
of
corn
and
the
stranger
walked
back
trimming
it
as
quietly
as
though
pulling
up
trees
were
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
little
john
from
his
saw
the
feat
and
could
hardly
restrain
a
long
whistle
by
our
lady
he
muttered
to
himself
i
would
not
be
in
master
robin
s
boots
whatever
robin
thought
upon
seeing
the
stranger
s
strength
he
uttered
not
a
word
and
budged
not
an
inch
he
only
put
his
oak
staff
at
parry
as
the
other
took
his
stand
there
was
a
threefold
surprise
that
day
by
the
brookside
the
stranger
and
robin
and
little
john
in
the
bushes
all
found
a
combat
that
upset
all
reckoning
the
stranger
for
all
his
easy
strength
and
cool
nerve
found
an
antagonist
who
met
his
blows
with
the
skill
of
a
woodman
robin
found
the
stranger
as
hard
to
hit
as
though
fenced
in
by
an
oak
hedge
while
little
john
rolled
over
and
over
in
silent
joy
back
and
forth
swayed
the
fighters
their
cudgels
pounding
this
way
and
that
knocking
off
splinters
and
bark
and
threatening
direst
damage
to
bone
and
muscle
and
skin
back
and
forth
they
pranced
kicking
up
a
cloud
of
dust
and
gasping
for
fresh
air
from
a
little
way
off
you
would
have
vowed
that
these
two
men
were
trying
to
put
out
a
fire
so
thickly
hung
the
cloud
of
battle
over
them
thrice
did
robin
smite
the
scarlet
man
with
such
blows
that
a
less
stout
fellow
must
have
bowled
over
only
twice
did
the
scarlet
man
smite
robin
but
the
second
blow
was
like
to
finish
him
the
first
had
been
delivered
over
the
knuckles
and
though
twas
a
glancing
stroke
it
well
nigh
broke
robin
s
fingers
so
that
he
could
not
easily
raise
his
staff
again
and
while
he
was
dancing
about
in
pain
and
muttering
a
oath
the
other
s
staff
came
swinging
through
the
cloud
at
one
side
zip
and
struck
him
under
the
arm
down
went
robin
as
though
he
were
a
flat
down
into
the
dust
of
the
road
but
despite
the
pain
he
was
bounding
up
again
like
an
india
rubber
man
to
renew
the
attack
when
little
john
interfered
hold
said
he
bursting
out
of
the
bushes
and
seizing
the
stranger
s
weapon
hold
i
say
nay
retorted
the
stranger
quietly
i
was
not
offering
to
smite
him
while
he
was
down
but
if
there
be
a
whole
nest
of
you
hatching
here
by
the
waterside
cluck
out
the
other
chicks
and
i
ll
make
shift
to
fight
them
not
for
all
the
deer
in
sherwood
cried
robin
you
are
a
good
fellow
and
a
gentleman
i
ll
fight
no
more
with
you
for
verily
i
feel
sore
in
wrist
and
body
nor
shall
any
of
mine
molest
you
sooth
to
say
robin
did
not
look
in
good
fighting
trim
his
clothes
were
coated
with
dirt
one
of
his
hosen
had
slipped
halfway
down
from
his
knee
the
sleeve
of
his
jerkin
was
split
and
his
face
was
streaked
with
sweat
and
dirt
little
john
eyed
him
drolly
how
now
good
master
quoth
he
the
sport
you
were
to
kick
up
has
left
you
in
sorry
plight
let
me
dust
your
coat
for
marry
it
has
been
dusted
enough
already
replied
robin
and
i
now
believe
the
scripture
saying
that
all
men
are
but
dust
for
it
has
sifted
me
through
and
through
and
lined
my
gullet
an
inch
deep
by
your
leave
and
he
went
to
the
brookside
and
drank
deep
and
laved
his
face
and
hands
all
this
while
the
stranger
had
been
eyeing
robin
attentively
and
listening
to
his
voice
as
though
striving
to
recall
it
if
i
mistake
not
he
said
slowly
at
last
you
are
that
famous
outlaw
robin
hood
of
you
say
right
replied
robin
but
my
fame
has
been
tumbling
sadly
about
in
the
dust
now
why
did
i
not
know
you
at
once
continued
the
stranger
this
battle
need
not
have
happened
for
i
came
abroad
to
find
you
and
thought
to
have
remembered
your
face
and
speech
know
you
not
me
rob
my
lad
hast
ever
been
to
gamewell
lodge
ha
will
gamewell
my
dear
old
chum
will
gamewell
shouted
robin
throwing
his
arms
about
the
other
in
sheer
affection
what
an
ass
i
was
not
to
recognize
you
but
it
has
been
years
since
we
parted
and
your
gentle
schooling
has
polished
you
off
will
embraced
his
cousin
no
less
heartily
we
are
quits
on
not
knowing
kinsmen
he
said
for
you
have
changed
and
strengthened
much
from
the
stripling
with
whom
i
used
to
run
foot
races
in
old
but
why
seek
you
me
asked
robin
you
know
i
am
an
outlaw
and
dangerous
company
and
how
left
you
mine
uncle
and
have
you
heard
aught
of
late
of
of
maid
marian
your
last
question
first
answered
will
laughing
for
i
perceive
that
it
lies
nearest
your
heart
i
saw
maid
marian
not
many
weeks
after
the
great
shooting
at
nottingham
when
you
won
her
the
golden
arrow
she
prizes
the
bauble
among
her
dearest
possessions
though
it
has
made
her
an
enemy
in
the
sheriff
s
proud
daughter
maid
marian
bade
me
tell
you
if
i
ever
saw
you
that
she
must
return
to
queen
eleanor
s
court
but
she
could
never
forget
the
happy
days
in
the
greenwood
as
for
the
old
squire
he
is
still
hale
and
hearty
though
rheumatic
withal
he
speaks
of
you
as
a
sad
young
dog
but
for
all
that
is
secretly
proud
of
your
skill
at
the
bow
and
of
the
way
you
are
pestering
the
sheriff
whom
he
likes
not
twas
for
my
father
s
sake
that
i
am
now
in
the
open
an
outlaw
like
yourself
he
has
had
a
steward
a
surly
fellow
enough
who
while
i
was
away
at
school
his
way
to
favor
until
he
lorded
it
over
the
whole
house
then
he
grew
right
saucy
and
impudent
but
my
father
minded
it
not
deeming
the
fellow
indispensable
in
managing
the
estate
but
when
i
came
back
it
irked
me
sorely
to
see
the
fellow
strut
about
as
though
he
owned
the
place
he
was
sly
enough
with
me
at
first
and
would
the
squire
only
while
i
was
out
of
earshot
it
chanced
one
day
however
that
i
heard
loud
voices
through
an
open
window
and
paused
to
hearken
that
vile
servant
called
my
father
a
meddling
old
fool
fool
and
meddler
art
thou
thyself
varlet
i
shouted
springing
through
the
window
for
thy
impudence
and
in
my
heat
i
smote
him
a
blow
mightier
than
i
intended
for
i
have
some
strength
in
mine
arm
the
fellow
rolled
over
and
never
breathed
afterwards
i
think
i
broke
his
neck
or
something
the
like
then
i
knew
that
the
sheriff
would
use
this
as
a
pretext
to
hound
my
father
if
i
tarried
so
i
bade
the
squire
farewell
and
told
him
i
would
seek
you
in
now
by
my
halidom
said
robin
hood
for
a
man
escaping
the
law
you
took
it
about
as
coolly
as
one
could
wish
to
see
you
come
tripping
along
decked
out
in
all
your
gay
plumage
and
trolling
forth
a
roundelay
one
would
think
you
had
not
a
care
in
all
the
world
indeed
i
remarked
to

hoped

robin

little

and
they
all

hands
again
and
swore

true

to
the
other
and
to
robin

men
in

forest
chapter
vii
how
robin
hood
met
friar
tuck
the
friar
took
robin
hood
on
his
back
deep
water
he
did
bestride
and
spake
neither
good
word
nor
bad
till
he
came
at
the
other
side
in
summer
time
when
leaves
grow
green
and
flowers
are
fresh
and
gay
robin
hood
and
his
merry
men
were
all
disposed
to
play
thus
runs
a
quaint
old
ballad
which
begins
the
next
adventure
then
some
would
leap
and
some
would
run
and
some
try
archery
and
some
ply
the
and
some
fall
to
with
the
good
broad
sword
some
again
would
try
a
round
at
buffet
and
fisticuff
and
thus
by
every
variety
of
sport
and
exercise
they
perfected
themselves
in
skill
and
made
the
band
and
its
prowess
well
known
throughout
all
england
it
had
been
a
custom
of
robin
hood
s
to
pick
out
the
best
men
in
all
the
countryside
whenever
he
heard
of
one
more
than
usually
skilled
in
any
feat
of
arms
he
would
seek
the
man
and
test
him
in
personal
encounter
which
did
not
always
end
happily
for
robin
and
when
he
had
found
a
man
to
his
liking
he
offered
him
service
with
the
bold
fellows
of
sherwood
forest
thus
it
came
about
that
one
day
after
a
practice
at
shooting
in
which
little
john
struck
down
a
hart
at
five
hundred
feet
distance
robin
hood
was
fain
to
boast
god
s
blessing
on
your
heart
he
cried
clapping
the
burly
fellow
on
the
shoulder
i
would
travel
an
hundred
miles
to
find
one
who
could
match
you
at
this
will
scarlet
laughed
full
roundly
there
lives
a
curtall
friar
in
fountain
s
abbey
tuck
by
name
who
can
beat
both
him
and
you
he
said
robin
pricked
up
his
ears
at
this
free
speech
by
our
lady
he
said
i
ll
neither
eat
nor
drink
till
i
see
this
same
and
with
his
usual
impetuosity
he
at
once
set
about
arming
himself
for
the
adventure
on
his
head
he
placed
a
cap
of
steel
underneath
his
lincoln
green
he
wore
a
coat
of
chain
metal
then
with
sword
and
buckler
girded
at
his
side
he
made
a
goodly
show
but
he
also
took
with
him
his
stout
yew
bow
and
a
sheaf
of
chosen
arrows
so
he
set
forth
upon
his
way
with
blithe
heart
for
it
was
a
day
when
the
whole
face
of
the
earth
seemed
glad
and
rejoicing
in
pulsing
life
steadily
he
pressed
forward
by
winding
ways
till
he
came
to
a
green
broad
pasture
land
at
whose
edge
flowed
a
stream
dipping
in
and
out
among
the
willows
and
rushes
on
the
banks
a
pleasant
stream
it
was
but
it
flowed
calmly
as
though
of
some
depth
in
the
middle
robin
did
not
fancy
getting
his
feet
wet
or
his
fine
suit
of
mail
rusted
so
he
paused
on
the
hither
bank
to
rest
and
take
his
bearings
as
he
sat
down
quietly
under
the
shade
of
a
drooping
willow
he
heard
snatches
of
a
jovial
song
floating
to
him
from
the
farther
side
then
came
a
sound
of
two
men
s
voices
arguing
one
was
upholding
the
merits
of
hasty
pudding
and
the
other
stood
out
stoutly
for
meat
pie
especially
quoth
this
one
when
flavored
with
young
onions
gramercy
muttered
robin
to
himself
that
is
a
tantalizing
speech
to
a
hungry
man
but
odds
bodikins
did
ever
two
men
talk
more
alike
than
those
two
fellows
yonder
in
truth
robin
could
well
marvel
at
the
speech
for
the
voices
were
curiously
alike
presently
the
willows
parted
on
the
other
bank
and
robin
could
hardly
forebear
laughing
out
right
his
mystery
was
explained
it
was
not
two
men
who
had
done
all
this
singing
and
talking
but
one
and
that
one
a
stout
curtall
friar
who
wore
a
long
cloak
over
his
portly
frame
tied
with
a
cord
in
the
middle
on
his
head
was
a
knight
s
helmet
and
in
his
hand
was
a
no
more
warlike
weapon
than
a
huge
pasty
pie
with
which
he
sat
down
by
the
water
s
edge
his
twofold
argument
was
finished
the
meat
pie
had
triumphed
and
no
wonder
for
it
was
the
present
witness
soon
to
give
its
own
testimony
but
first
the
friar
took
off
his
helmet
to
cool
his
head
and
a
droll
picture
he
made
his
head
was
as
round
as
an
apple
and
eke
as
smooth
in
spots
a
fringe
of
close
curling
black
hair
grew
round
the
base
of
his
skull
but
his
crown
was
bare
and
shiny
as
an
egg
his
cheeks
also
were
smooth
and
red
and
shiny
and
his
little
gray
eyes
danced
about
with
the
funniest
air
imaginable
you
would
not
have
blamed
robin
hood
for
wanting
to
laugh
had
you
heard
this
serious
talk
and
then
seen
this
jovial
man
good
humor
and
fat
living
stood
out
all
over
him
yet
for
all
that
he
looked
stout
enough
and
able
to
take
care
of
himself
with
any
man
his
short
neck
was
thick
like
that
of
a
berkshire
bull
his
shoulders
were
set
far
back
and
his
arms
sprouted
therefrom
like
two
oak
limbs
as
he
sat
him
down
the
cloak
fell
apart
disclosing
a
sword
and
buckler
as
stout
as
robin
s
own
nathless
robin
was
not
dismayed
at
sight
of
the
weapons
instead
his
heart
fell
within
him
when
he
saw
the
meat
pie
which
was
now
in
fair
way
to
be
devoured
before
his
very
eyes
for
the
friar
lost
no
time
in
thrusting
one
hand
deep
into
the
pie
while
he
crossed
himself
with
the
other
thereupon
robin
seized
his
bow
and
fitted
a
shaft
hey
friar
he
sang
out
carry
me
over
the
water
or
else
i
can
not
answer
for
your
the
other
started
at
the
unexpected
greeting
and
laid
his
hand
upon
his
sword
then
he
looked
up
and
beheld
robin
s
arrow
pointing
full
upon
him
put
down
your
bow
fellow
he
shouted
back
and
i
will
bring
you
over
the
brook
tis
our
duty
in
life
to
help
each
other
and
your
keen
shaft
shows
me
that
you
are
a
man
worthy
of
some
so
the
friar
knight
got
him
up
gravely
though
his
eyes
twinkled
with
a
cunning
light
and
laid
aside
his
beloved
pie
and
his
cloak
and
his
sword
and
his
buckler
and
waded
across
the
stream
with
waddling
dignity
then
he
took
robin
hood
upon
his
back
and
spoke
neither
good
word
nor
bad
till
he
came
to
the
other
side
lightly
leaped
robin
off
his
back
and
said
i
am
much
beholden
to
you
good
beholden
say
you
rejoined
the
other
drawing
his
sword
then
by
my
faith
you
shall
e
en
repay
your
score
now
mine
own
affairs
which
are
of
a
spiritual
kind
and
much
more
important
than
yours
which
are
carnal
lie
on
the
other
side
of
this
stream
i
see
that
you
are
a
likely
man
and
one
moreover
who
would
not
refuse
to
serve
the
church
i
must
therefore
pray
of
you
that
whatsoever
i
have
done
unto
you
you
will
do
also
unto
me
in
short
my
son
you
must
e
en
carry
me
back
courteously
enough
was
this
said
but
so
suddenly
had
the
friar
drawn
his
sword
that
robin
had
no
time
to
unsling
his
bow
from
his
back
whither
he
had
placed
it
to
avoid
getting
it
wet
or
to
unfasten
his
scabbard
so
he
was
fain
to
temporize
nay
good
father
but
i
shall
get
my
feet
wet
he
commenced
are
your
feet
any
better
than
mine
retorted
the
other
i
fear
me
now
that
i
have
already
wetted
myself
so
sadly
as
to
lay
in
a
store
of
rheumatic
pains
by
way
of
i
am
not
so
strong
as
you
continued
robin
that
helmet
and
sword
and
buckler
would
be
my
undoing
on
the
uncertain
footing
amidstream
to
say
nothing
of
your
holy
flesh
and
then
i
will
lighten
up
somewhat
replied
the
other
calmly
promise
to
carry
me
across
and
i
will
lay
aside
my
war
agreed
said
robin
and
the
friar
thereupon
stripped
himself
and
robin
bent
his
stout
back
and
took
him
up
even
as
he
had
promised
now
the
stones
at
the
bottom
of
the
stream
were
round
and
slippery
and
the
current
swept
along
strongly
in
the
middle
robin
had
a
heavier
load
than
the
other
had
borne
nor
did
he
know
the
ford
so
he
went
stumbling
along
now
stepping
into
a
deep
hole
now
stumbling
over
a
boulder
in
a
manner
that
threatened
to
unseat
his
rider
or
plunge
them
both
clear
under
current
but
the
fat
friar
hung
on
and
dug
his
heels
into
his
steed
s
ribs
in
as
gallant
manner
as
if
he
were
riding
in
a
tournament
while
as
for
poor
robin
the
sweat
ran
down
him
in
torrents
and
he
gasped
like
the
winded
horse
he
was
but
at
last
he
managed
to
stagger
out
on
the
bank
and
deposit
his
unwieldy
load
no
sooner
had
he
set
the
friar
down
than
he
seized
his
own
sword
now
holy
friar
quoth
he
panting
and
wiping
the
sweat
from
his
brow
what
say
the
scriptures
that
you
quote
so
glibly
be
not
weary
of
well
doing
you
must
carry
me
back
again
or
i
swear
that
i
will
make
a
out
of
your
jacket
the
friar
s
gray
eyes
once
more
twinkled
with
a
cunning
gleam
that
boded
no
good
to
robin
but
his
voice
was
as
calm
and
courteous
as
ever
your
wits
are
keen
my
son
he
said
and
i
see
that
the
waters
of
the
stream
have
not
quenched
your
spirit
once
more
will
i
bend
my
back
to
the
oppressor
and
carry
the
weight
of
the
so
robin
mounted
again
in
high
glee
and
carried
his
sword
in
his
hand
and
went
prepared
to
tarry
upon
the
other
side
but
while
he
was
bethinking
himself
what
great
words
to
use
when
he
should
arrive
thither
he
felt
himself
slipping
from
the
friar
s
broad
back
he
clutched
frantically
to
save
himself
but
had
too
round
a
surface
to
grasp
besides
being
hampered
by
his
weapon
so
down
went
he
with
a
loud
splash
into
the
middle
of
the
stream
where
the
crafty
friar
had
conveyed
him
there
quoth
the
holy
man
choose
you
choose
you
my
fine
fellow
whether
you
will
sink
or
swim
and
he
gained
his
own
bank
without
more
ado
while
robin
thrashed
and
spluttered
about
until
he
made
shift
to
grasp
a
willow
wand
and
thus
haul
himself
ashore
on
the
other
side
then
robin
s
rage
waxed
furious
despite
his
wetting
and
he
took
his
bow
and
his
arrows
and
let
fly
one
shaft
after
another
at
the
worthy
friar
but
they
rattled
harmlessly
off
his
steel
buckler
while
he
laughed
and
minded
them
no
more
than
if
they
had
been
shoot
on
shoot
on
good
fellow
he
sang
out
shoot
as
you
have
begun
if
you
shoot
here
a
summer
s
day
your
mark
i
will
not
shun
so
robin
shot
and
passing
well
till
all
his
arrows
were
gone
when
from
very
rage
he
began
to
revile
him
you
bloody
villain
shouted
he
you
hypocrite
you
reviler
of
good
hasty
pudding
come
but
within
reach
of
my
sword
arm
and
friar
or
no
friar
i
ll
shave
your
tonsure
closer
than
ever
monk
was
shaven
before
soft
you
and
fair
said
the
friar
unconcernedly
hard
words
are
cheap
and
you
may
need
your
wind
presently
an
you
would
like
a
bout
with
swords
meet
me
halfway
i
the
and
with
this
speech
the
friar
waded
into
the
brook
sword
in
hand
where
he
was
met
halfway
by
the
impetuous
outlaw
thereupon
began
a
fierce
and
mighty
battle
up
and
down
in
and
out
back
and
forth
they
fought
the
swords
flashed
in
the
rays
of
the
declining
sun
and
then
met
with
a
clash
that
would
have
shivered
less
sturdy
weapons
or
disarmed
less
sturdy
wielders
many
a
smart
blow
was
landed
but
each
perceived
that
the
other
wore
an
undercoat
of
linked
mail
which
might
not
be
pierced
nathless
their
ribs
ached
at
the
force
of
the
blows
once
and
again
they
paused
by
mutual
consent
and
caught
breath
and
looked
hard
each
at
the
other
for
never
had
either
met
so
stout
a
fellow
finally
in
a
furious
onset
of
lunge
and
parry
robin
s
foot
stepped
on
a
rolling
stone
and
he
went
down
upon
his
knees
but
his
antagonist
would
not
take
this
advantage
he
paused
until
robin
should
get
upon
his
feet
now
by
our
lady
cried
the
outlaw
using
his
favorite
oath
you
are
the
fairest
swordsman
that
i
have
met
in
many
a
long
day
i
would
beg
a
boon
of
what
is
it
said
the
other
give
me
leave
to
set
my
horn
to
my
mouth
and
blow
three
blasts
that
will
i
do
said
the
curtall
friar
blow
till
your
breath
fails
an
it
please
then
says
the
old
ballad
robin
hood
set
his
horn
to
mouth
and
blew
mighty
blasts
and
half
a
hundred
yeomen
bows
bent
came
raking
over
the
lee
whose
men
are
these
said
the
friar
that
come
so
hastily
these
men
are
mine
said
robin
hood
feeling
that
his
time
to
laugh
was
come
at
last
then
said
the
friar
in
his
turn
a
boon
a
boon
the
like
i
gave
to
you

me

my
fist
to
my
mouth
and
whistle

do
said
robin
or
else
i
were
lacking
in
the
friar
set
his
fist
to
his
mouth
and
put
the
horn
to
shame
by
the
piercing
whistles
he
blew
whereupon
half
a
hundred
great
dogs
came
running
and
jumping
so
swiftly
that
they
had
reached
their
bank
as
soon
as
robin
hood
s
men
had
reached
his
side
then
followed
a
rare
foolish
conflict
stutely
much
little
john
and
the
other
outlaws
began
sending
their
arrows
whizzing
toward
the
opposite
bank
but
the
dogs
which
were
taught
of
the
friar
dodged
the
missiles
cleverly
and
ran
and
fetched
them
back
again
just
as
the
dogs
of
catch
sticks
i
have
never
seen
the
like
of
this
in
my
days
cried
little
john
amazed
tis
rank
sorcery
and
take
off
your
dogs
friar
tuck
shouted
will
scarlet
who
had
but
then
run
up
and
who
now
stood
laughing
heartily
at
the
scene
friar
tuck
exclaimed
robin
astounded

years

tended
the
abbey
here
preached
o
sundays
and
married
and
christened
and
buried
folk
and
fought
too
if

and
if
it
smacks
not
too
much
of
boasting
i
have
not
yet
met
the
knight
or
trooper
or
yeoman
that
i
would
yield
before
but
yours
is

would
fain
know

robin

outlaw
who
has
been
assisting
you
at
this
christening
said
will
scarlet
glancing
roguishly
at
the
two
opponents
dripping
garments
and
at
this
sally
the
whole
bad
burst
into
a
shout
of
laughter
in
which
robin
and
friar
tuck
joined
robin
hood
cried
the
good
friar
presently
holding
his
sides
are
you
indeed
that
famous
yeoman
then
i
like
you
well
and
had
i
known
you
earlier

carried
you
across
and
shared
my
pasty
pie
with
to

soothly
replied
robin
gaily
twas
that
same
pie
that
led
me
to
be
rude
now
therefore

greenwood
chapter
viii
how
s
wooing
was
prospered
what
is
thy
name
then
said
robin
hood
come
tell
me
without
any
fail
by
the
faith
o
my
body
then
said
the
young
man
my
name
it
is
friar
tuck
and
much
the
miller
s
son
soon
became
right
good
friends
over
the
steaming
stew
they
jointly
prepared
for
the
merry
men
that
evening
tuck
was
mightily
pleased
when
he
found
a
man
in
the
forest
who
could
make
pasties
and
who
had
cooked
for
no
less
person
than
the
high
sheriff
himself
while
much
marveled
at
the
friar
s
knowledge
of
herbs
and
simples
and
woodland
things
which
savored
a
stew
greatly
so
they
gabbled
together
like
two
old
gossips
and
between
them
made
such
a
tasty
mess
that
robin
hood
and
his
stout
followers
were
like
never
to
leave
off
eating
and
the
friar
said
grace
too
with
great
unction
over
the
food
and
robin
said
amen
and
that
henceforth
they
were
always
to
have
mass
of
sundays
so
robin
walked
forth
into
the
wood
that
evening
with
his
stomach
full
and
his
heart
therefore
in
great
contentment
and
love
for
other
men
he
did
not
stop
the
first
as
his
manner
often
was
and
desire
a
fight
instead
he
stepped
behind
a
tree
when
he
heard
a
man
s
voice
in
song
and
waited
to
behold
the
singer
perhaps
he
remembered
also
the
merry
chanting
of
will
scarlet
and
how
he
had
tried
to
give
it
pause
a
few
days
before
like
will
this
fellow
was
clad
in
scarlet
though
he
did
not
look
quite
as
fine
a
gentleman
nathless
he
was
a
sturdy
yeoman
of
honest
face
and
a
voice
far
sweeter
than
will
s
he
seemed
to
be
a
strolling
minstrel
for
he
bore
a
harp
in
his
hand
which
he
thrummed
while
his
lusty
tenor
voice
rang
out
with
hey
down
and
a
down
and
a
down
i
ve
a
lassie
back
i
the
town
come
day
come
night
come
dark
or
light
she
will
wed
me
back
i
the
town
robin
let
the
singer
pass
caroling
on
his
way
tis
not
in
me
to
disturb
a
lover
this
night
he
muttered
a
memory
of
marian
coming
back
to
him
pray
heaven
she
may
be
true
to
him
and
the
wedding
be
a
gay
one
back
i
the
town
so
robin
went
back
to
his
camp
where
he
told
of
the
minstrel
if
any
of
ye
set
on
him
after
this
quoth
he
in
ending
bring
him
to
me
for
i
would
have
speech
with
the
very
next
day
his
wish
was
gratified
little
john
and
much
the
miller
s
son
were
out
together
on
a
foraging
expedition
when
they
espied
the
same
young
man
at
least
they
thought
it
must
be
he
for
he
was
clad
in
scarlet
and
carried
a
harp
in
his
hand
but
now
he
came
drooping
along
the
way
his
scarlet
was
all
in
tatters
and
at
every
step
he
fetched
a
sigh
alack
and
a
then
stepped
forth
little
john
and
much
the
miller
s
son
ho
do
not
wet
the
earth
with
your
weeping
said
little
john
else
we
shall
all
have
no
sooner
did
the
young
man
catch
sight
of
them
than
he
bent
his
bow
and
held
an
arrow
back
to
his
ear
stand
off
stand
off
he
said
what
is
your
will
with
me
put
by
your
weapon
said
much
we
will
not
harm
you
but
you
must
come
before
our
master
straight
under
yon
greenwood
so
the
minstrel
put
by
his
bow
and
suffered
himself
to
be
led
before
robin
hood
how
now
quoth
robin
when
he
beheld
his
sorry
countenance
are
you
not
he
whom
i
heard
no
longer
ago
than
yesternight
caroling
so
blithely
about
a
lassie
back
i
the
town

same
in
body

the
other
sadly

my
spirit

grievously

me
your
tale
said
robin
courteously
belike
i
can
help
that
can

man

earth

said
the
stranger
nathless
i
ll
tell
you
the
tale
yesterday
i
stood
pledged
to
a
maid
and
thought
soon
to
wed
her
but
she
has
been
taken
from
me
and
is
to
become
an
old
knight
s
bride
this
very
day
and
as
for
me
i
care
not
what
ending
comes
to
my
days
or

robin
how

the
old
knight
so
sudden
vantage

this
way

us
and

great
favor
that

old
returned
crusader
coveted
the
land
whereon
my
lady
dwells
the
estate
is
not
large
but
all
in
her
own
right
whereupon
her
brother
says
she
shall
wed
a
title
and
he
and
the
old
knight
have
fixed
it
up
for
nay
but

robin

the
other

sorry
dog

threw
one
of
his
varlets
into
a
thorn
hedge
and
another
into
a
and
a
third
landed
into
a
ditch
but
i
couldn
t
do

love
i
swear
upon

book
that

true
servant

five
miles
from
here
and
at
three
o
the
then
to
plympton

cried
robin
suddenly
springing
into
action
and
he
gave
out
orders
like
a
general

stutely
do

good
men
over
against
plympton
church
gainst
three
o

friar
tuck
hold
yourself
in
readiness
good
book
in
hand
at
the
church
mayhap
you
had
best
go
ahead
of
us
the
fat
bishop
of
hereford
was
full
of
pomp
and
importance
that
day
at
plympton
church
he
was
to
celebrate
the
marriage
of
an
old
knight
a
returned
crusader
and
a
landed
young
woman
and
all
the
gentry
thereabout
were
to
grace
the
occasion
with
their
presence
the
church
itself
was
gaily
festooned
with
flowers
for
the
ceremony
while
out
in
the
at
one
side
brown
ale
flowed
freely
for
all
the
servitors
already
were
the
guests
beginning
to
assemble
when
the
bishop
back
in
the
vestry
saw
a
minstrel
clad
in
green
walk
up
boldly
to
the
door
and
peer
within
it
was
robin
hood
who
had
borrowed
allan
s
harp
for
the
time
now
who
are
you
fellow
quoth
the
bishop
and
what
do
you
here
at
the
with
you
harp
and
saucy
air
may
it
please
your
reverence
returned
robin
bowing
very
humbly
i
am
but
a
strolling
harper
yet
likened
the
best
in
the
whole
north
countree
and
i
had
hope
that
my
thrumming
might
add
zest
to
the
wedding
what
tune
can
you
harp
demanded
the
bishop
i
can
harp
a
tune
so
merry
that
a
forlorn
lover
will
forget
he
is
jilted
said
robin
i
can
harp
another
tune
that
will
make
a
bride
forsake
her
lord
at
the
altar
i
can
harp
another
tune
that
will
bring
loving
souls
together
though
they
were
up
hill
and
down
dale
five
good
miles
away
from
each
then
welcome
good
minstrel
said
the
bishop
music
pleases
me
right
well
and
if
you
can
play
up
to
your
prattle
twill
indeed
grace
your
ceremony
let
us
have
a
sample
of
your
nay
i
must
not
put
finger
to
string
until
the
bride
and
groom
have
come
such
a
thing
would
ill
fortune
both
us
and
have
it
as
you
will
said
the
bishop
but
here
comes
the
party
then
up
the
lane
to
the
church
came
the
old
knight
preceded
by
ten
archers
liveried
in
scarlet
and
gold
a
brave
sight
the
archers
made
but
their
master
walked
slowly
leaning
upon
a
cane
and
shaking
as
though
in
a
palsy
and
after
them
came
a
sweet
lass
leaning
upon
her
brother
s
arm
her
hair
did
shine
like
glistering
gold
and
her
eyes
were
like
blue
violets
that
peep
out
shyly
at
the
sun
the
color
came
and
went
in
her
cheeks
like
that
tinting
of
a
and
her
face
was
flushed
as
though
she
had
been
weeping
but
now
she
walked
with
a
proud
air
as
though
she
defied
the
world
to
crush
her
spirit
she
had
but
two
maids
with
her
finikin
lasses
with
black
eyes
and
broad
bosoms
who
set
off
their
lady
s
more
delicate
beauty
well
one
held
up
the
bride
s
gown
from
the
ground
the
other
carried
flowers
in
plenty
now
by
all
the
wedding
bells
that
ever
were
rung
quoth
robin
boldly
this
is
the
worst
matched
pair
that
ever
mine
eyes
beheld
silence
miscreant
said
a
man
who
stood
near
the
bishop
had
hurriedly
donned
his
gown
and
now
stood
ready
to
meet
the
couple
at
the
chancel
but
robin
paid
no
heed
to
him
he
let
the
knight
and
his
ten
archers
pass
by
then
he
strode
up
to
the
bride
and
placed
himself
on
the
other
side
from
her
brother
courage
lady
he
whispered
there
is
another
minstrel
near
who
mayhap
may
play
more
to
your
the
lady
glanced
at
him
with
a
frightened
air
but
read
such
honesty
and
kindness
in
his
glance
that
she
brightened
and
gave
him
a
grateful
look
stand
aside
fool
cried
the
brother
wrathfully
nay
but
i
am
to
bring
good
fortune
to
the
bride
by
accompanying
her
through
the
said
robin
laughing
thereupon
he
was
allowed
to
walk
by
her
side
unmolested
up
to
the
chancel
with
the
party
now
strike
up
your
music
fellow
ordered
the
bishop
right
gladly
will
i
quoth
robin
an
you
will
let
me
choose
my
instrument
for
sometimes
i
like
the
harp
and
other
times
i
think
the
horn
makes
the
merriest
music
in
all
the
and
he
drew
forth
his
bugle
from
underneath
his
green
cloak
and
blew
three
winding
notes
that
made
the
church
rafters
ring
again
seize
him
yelled
the
bishop
there
s
mischief
afoot
these
are
the
tricks
of
robin
hood
the
ten
liveried
archers
rushed
forward
from
the
rear
of
the
church
where
they
had
been
stationed
but
their
rush
was
blocked
by
the
onlookers
who
now
rose
from
their
pews
in
alarm
and
crowded
the
aisles
meanwhile
robin
had
leaped
lightly
over
the
chancel
rail
and
stationed
himself
in
a
nook
by
the
altar
stand
where
you
are
he
shouted
drawing
his
bow
the
first
man
to
pass
the
rail
dies
the
death
and
all
ye
who
have
come
to
witness
a
wedding
stay
in
your
seats
we
shall
e
en
have
one
since
we
are
come
into
the
church
but
the
bride
shall
choose
her
own
swain
then
up
rose
another
great
commotion
at
the
door
and
good
bowmen
came
marching
in
with
will
stutely
at
their
head
and
they
seized
the
ten
liveried
archers
and
the
bride
s
scowling
brother
and
the
other
men
on
guard
and
bound
them
prisoners
then
in
came
decked
out
gaily
with
will
scarlet
for
best
man
and
they
walked
gravely
down
the
aisle
and
stood
over
against
the
chancel
before
a
maiden
weds
she
chooses
an
the
laws
of
good
king
harry
be
just
ones
said
robin
now
maiden
before
this
wedding
continues
whom
will
you
have
to
husband
the
maiden
answered
not
in
words
but
smiled
with
a
glad
light
in
her
eyes
and
walked
over
to
allan
and
clasped
her
arms
about
his
neck
that
is
her
true
love
said
robin
young
allan
instead
of
the
gouty
knight
and
the
true
lovers

be
married
at
this
time
before
we
depart
away
now
my
lord
bishop
proceed
with
the
ceremony
nay
that
shall
not
be
protested
the
bishop
the
banns
must
be
cried
three
times
in
the
church
such
is
the
law
of
our
come
here
little
john
called
robin
impatiently
and
plucked
off
the
bishop
s
frock
from
his
back
and
put
it
on
the
yeoman
now
the
bishop
was
short
and
fat
and
little
john
was
long
and
lean
the
gown
hung
loosely
over
little
john
s
shoulders
and
came
only
to
his
waist
he
was
a
fine
comical
sight
and
the
people
began
to
laugh
consumedly
at
him
by
the
faith
o
my
body
said
robin
this
cloth
makes
you
a
man
you
re
the
finest
bishop
that
ever
i
saw
in
my
life
now
cry
the
so
little
john
clambered
awkwardly
into
the
quire
his
short
gown
fluttering
gaily
and
he
called
the
banns
for
the
marriage
of
the
maid
and
once
twice
and
thrice
that
s
not
enough
said
robin
your
gown
is
so
short
that
you
must
talk
then
little
john
asked
them
in
the
church
four
five
six
and
seven
times
good
enough
said
robin
now
belike
i
see
a
worthy
friar
in
the
back
of
this
church
who
can
say
a
better
service
than
ever
my
lord
bishop
of
hereford
my
lord
bishop
shall
be
witness
and
seal
the
papers
but
do
you
good
friar
bless
this
pair
with
book
and
so
friar
tuck
who
all
along
had
been
back
in
one
corner
of
the
church
came
forward
and
allan
and
his
maid
kneeled
before
him
while
the
old
knight
held
an
unwilling
witness
gnashed
his
teeth
in
impotent
rage
and
the
friar
began
with
the
ceremony
when
he
asked
who
giveth
this
woman
robin
stepped
up
and
answered
in
a
clear
voice
i
do
i
robin
hood
of
barnesdale
and
sherwood
and
he
who
takes
her
from
shall
buy
her
full
so
the
twain
were
declared
man
and
wife
and
duly
blessed
and
the
bride
was
kissed
by
each
sturdy
yeoman
beginning
with
robin
hood
now
i
can
not
end
this
jolly
tale
better
than
in
the
words
of
the
ballad
which
came
out
of
the
happening
and
which
has
been
sung
in
the
villages
and
countryside
ever
since
and
thus
having
end
of
this
merry
wedding
the
bride
lookt
like
a
queen
and
so
they
returned
to
the
merry
greenwood
amongst
the
leaves
so
chapter
ix
how
the
widow
s
three
sons
were
rescued
now
robin
hood
is
to
nottingham
gone
with
a
link
a
down
and
a
down
and
there
he
met
with
the
proud
sheriff
was
walking
along
the
town
the
was
a
merry
one
that
left
plympton
church
i
ween
but
not
so
merry
were
the
ones
left
behind
my
lord
bishop
of
hereford
was
stuck
up
in
the
and
left
gownless
and
fuming
the
ten
liveried
archers
were
variously
disposed
about
the
church
to
keep
him
company
two
of
them
being
locked
in
a
tiny
crypt
three
in
the
belfry
to
ring
us
a
wedding
peal
as
robin
said
and
the
others
under
quire
seats
or
in
the
vestry
the
bride
s
brother
at
her
entreaty
was
released
but
bidden
not
to
return
to
the
church
that
day
or
interfere
with
his
sister
again
on
pain
of
death
while
the
rusty
old
knight
was
forced
to
climb
a
high
tree
where
he
sat
insecurely
perched
among
the
branches
feebly
cursing
the
party
as
it
departed
it
was
then
approaching
sundown
but
none
of
the
retainers
or
villagers
dared
rescue
the
imprisoned
ones
that
night
for
fear
of
robin
hood
s
men
so
it
was
not
until
sunup
the
next
day
that
they
were
released
the
bishop
and
the
old
knight
stiff
as
they
were
did
not
delay
longer
than
for
breakfast
but
so
great
was
their
rage
and
shame
made
straight
to
nottingham
and
levied
the
sheriff
s
forces
the
sheriff
himself
was
not
anxious
to
try
conclusions
again
with
robin
in
the
open
perhaps
he
had
some
slight
scruples
regarding
his
oath
but
the
others
swore
that
they
would
go
straight
to
the
king
if
he
did
not
help
them
so
he
was
fain
to
consent
a
force
of
an
hundred
picked
men
from
the
royal
foresters
and
swordsmen
of
the
shire
was
gathered
together
and
marched
straightway
into
the
greenwood
there
as
fortune
would
have
it
they
surprised
some
score
of
outlaws
hunting
and
instantly
gave
chase
but
they
could
not
surround
the
outlaws
who
kept
well
in
the
lead
ever
and
anon
dropping
behind
a
log
or
boulder
to
speed
back
a
shaft
which
meant
mischief
to
the
pursuers
one
shaft
indeed
carried
off
the
sheriff
s
hat
and
caused
that
worthy
man
to
fall
forward
upon
his
horse
s
neck
from
sheer
terror
while
five
other
arrows
landed
in
the
fleshy
parts
of
foresters
arms
but
the
attacking
party
was
not
wholly
unsuccessful
one
outlaw
in
his
flight
stumbled
and
fell
when
two
others
instantly
stopped
and
helped
to
put
him
on
his
feet
again
they
were
the
widow
s
three
sons
stout
will
and
lester
and
john
the
pause
was
an
unlucky
one
for
them
as
a
party
of
sheriff
s
men
got
above
them
and
cut
them
off
from
their
fellows
swordsmen
came
up
in
the
rear
and
they
were
soon
hemmed
in
on
every
side
but
they
gave
good
account
of
themselves
and
before
they
had
been
overborne
by
force
of
numbers
they
had
killed
two
and
disabled
three
more
the
infuriated
attackers
were
almost
on
the
point
of
hewing
the
stout
outlaws
to
pieces
when
the
sheriff
cried
hold
bind
the
villains
we
will
follow
the
law
in
this
and
take
them
to
the
town
jail
but
i
promise
ye
the
biggest
public
hanging
that
has
been
seen
in
this
shire
for
many
changes
of
the
moon
so
they
bound
the
widow
s
three
sons
and
carried
them
back
speedily
to
nottingham
now
robin
hood
had
not
chanced
to
be
near
the
scene
of
the
fight
or
with
his
men
so
for
a
time
he
heard
nothing
of
the
happening
but
that
evening
while
returning
to
the
camp
he
was
met
by
the
widow
herself
who
came
weeping
along
the
way
what
news
what
news
good
woman
said
robin
hastily
but
courteously
for
he
liked
her
well
god
save
ye
master
robin
said
the
dame
wildly
god
keep
ye
from
the
fate
that
has
met
my
three
sons
the
sheriff
has
laid
hands
on
them
and
they
are
condemned
to
now
by
our
lady
that
cuts
me
to
the
heart
stout
will
and
lester
and
merry
john
the
earliest
friends
i
had
in
the
band
and
still
among
the
bravest
it
must
not
be
when
is
this
hanging
set
middle
the
tinker
tells
me
that
it
is
for
tomorrow
noon
replied
the
dame
by
the
truth
o
my
body
quoth
robin
you
could
not
tell
me
in
better
time
the
memory
of
the
old
days
when
you
freely
bade
me
sup
and
dine
would
spur
me
on
even
if
three
of
the
bravest
lads
in
all
the
shire
were
not
imperiled
trust
to
me
good
woman
the
old
widow
threw
herself
on
the
ground
and
embraced
his
knees
tis
dire
danger
i
am
asking
ye
to
face
she
said
weeping
and
yet
i
knew
your
brave
true
heart
would
answer
me
heaven
help
ye
good
master
robin
to
answer
a
poor
widow
s
prayers
then
robin
hood
sped
straightway
to
the
where
he
heard
the
details
of
the
skirmish
how
that
his
men
had
been
five
to
one
but
got
off
safely
as
they
thought
until
a
count
of
their
members
had
shown
the
loss
of
the
widow
s
three
sons
we
must
rescue
them
my
men
quoth
robin
even
from
out
the
shadow
of
the
rope
itself
whereupon
the
band
set
to
work
to
devise
ways
and
means
robin
walked
apart
a
little
way
with
his
head
leaned
thoughtfully
upon
his
breast
for
he
was
sore
troubled
when
whom
should
he
meet
but
an
old
begging
palmer
one
of
a
devout
order
which
made
pilgrimages
and
wandered
from
place
to
place
supported
by
charity
this
old
fellow
walked
boldly
up
to
robin
and
asked
alms
of
him
since
robin
had
been
wont
to
aid
members
of
his
order
what
news
what
news
thou
foolish
old
man
said
robin
what
news
i
do
thee
pray
three
squires
in
nottingham
town
quoth
the
palmer
are
condemned
to
die
belike
that
is
greater
news
than
the
shire
has
had
in
some
then
robin
s
idea
came
to
him
like
a
flash
come
change
thine
apparel
with
me
old
man
he
said
and
i
ll
give
thee
forty
shillings
in
good
silver
to
spend
in
beer
or
o
thine
apparel
is
good
the
palmer
protested
and
mine
is
ragged
and
torn
the
holy
church
teaches
that
thou
should
st
ne
er
laugh
an
old
man
to
i
am
in
simple
earnest
i
say
come
change
thine
apparel
with
mine
here
are
twenty
pieces
of
good
broad
gold
to
feast
they
brethren
right
so
the
palmer
was
persuaded
and
robin
put
on
the
old
man
s
hat
which
stood
full
high
in
the
crown
and
his
cloak
patched
with
black
and
blue
and
red
like
joseph
s
coat
of
many
colors
in
its
old
age
and
his
breeches
which
had
been
sewed
over
with
so
many
patterns
that
the
original
was
scarce
discernible
and
his
tattered
hose
and
his
shoes
cobbled
above
and
below
and
while
as
he
made
the
change
in
dress
he
made
so
many
whimsical
comments
also
about
a
man
s
pride
and
the
dress
that
makes
a
man
that
the
palmer
was
like
to
choke
with
cackling
laughter
i
warrant
you
the
two
were
comical
sights
when
they
parted
company
that
day
nathless
robin
s
own
mother
would
not
have
known
him
had
she
been
living
the
next
morning
the
whole
town
of
nottingham
was
early
astir
and
as
soon
as
the
gates
were
open
began
to
pour
in
for
a
triple
hanging
was
not
held
there
every
day
in
the
week
and
the
bustle
almost
equated
a
fair
day
robin
hood
in
his
palmer
s
disguise
was
one
of
the
first
ones
to
enter
the
gates
and
he
strolled
up
and
down
and
around
the
town
as
though
he
had
never
been
there
before
in
all
his
life
presently
he
came
to
the
and
beheld
thereon
three
gallows
erected
who
are
these
builded
for
my
son
asked
he
of
a
rough
soldier
standing
by
for
three
of
robin
hood
s
men
answered
the
other
and
it
were
robin
himself
twould
be
thrice
as
high
i
warrant
ye
but
robin
is
too
smart
to
get
within
the
sheriff
s
clutches
the
palmer
crossed
himself
they
say
that
he
is
a
bold
fellow
he
whined
ha
said
the
soldier
he
may
be
bold
enough
out
behind
stumps
i
the
forest
but
the
open
is
another
who
is
to
hang
these
three
poor
wretches
asked
the
palmer
that
hath
the
sheriff
not
decided
but
here
he
comes
now
to
answer
his
own
and
the
soldier
came
to
stiff
attention
as
the
sheriff
and
his
stalked
pompously
up
to
inspect
the
gallows
o
heaven
save
you
worshipful
sheriff
said
the
palmer
heaven
protect
you
what
will
you
give
a
silly
old
man
to
be
your
hangman
who
are
you
fellow
asked
the
sheriff
sharply
naught
save
a
poor
old
palmer
but
i
can
shrive
their
souls
and
hang
their
bodies
most
very
good
replied
the
other
the
fee
is
thirteen
pence
and
i
will
add
thereunto
some
suits
of
clothing
for
that
ragged
back
of
god
bless
ye
said
the
palmer
and
he
went
with
the
soldier
to
the
jail
to
prepare
his
three
men
for
execution
just
before
the
stroke
of
noon
the
doors
of
the
prison
opened
and
the
procession
of
the
condemned
came
forth
down
through
the
long
lines
of
packed
people
they
walked
to
the
the
palmer
in
the
lead
and
the
widow
s
three
sons
marching
firmly
erect
between
soldiers
at
the
gallows
foot
they
halted
the
palmer
whispered
to
them
as
though
offering
last
words
of
consolation
and
the
three
men
with
arms
bound
tightly
behind
their
backs
ascended
the
scaffold
followed
by
their
confessor
then
robin
stepped
to
the
edge
of
the
scaffold
while
the
people
grew
still
as
death
for
they
desired
to
hear
the
last
words
uttered
to
the
victims
but
robin
s
voice
did
not
quaver
forth
weakly
as
formerly
and
his
figure
had
stiffened
bolt
upright
beneath
the
black
robe
that
covered
his
rags
hark
ye
proud
sheriff
he
cried
i
was
ne
er
a
hangman
in
all
my
life
nor
do
i
now
intend
to
begin
that
trade
accurst
be
he
who
first
set
the
fashion
of
hanging
i
have
but
three
more
words
to
say
listen
to
them
and
forth
from
the
robe
he
drew
his
horn
and
blew
three
loud
blasts
thereon
then
his
keen
flew
forth
and
in
a
trice
stout
will
lester
and
merry
john
were
free
men
and
had
sprung
forward
and
seized
the
halberds
from
the
nearest
soldiers
guarding
the
gallows
seize
them
tis
robin
hood
screamed
the
sheriff
an
hundred
pounds
if
ye
hold
them
dead
or
alive
i
make
it
two
hundred
roared
the
fat
bishop
but
their
voices
were
drowned
in
the
uproar
that
ensued
immediately
after
robin
blew
his
horn
he
himself
had
drawn
his
sword
and
leaped
down
the
stairs
from
the
scaffold
followed
by
his
three
men
the
guard
had
closed
around
them
in
vain
effort
to
disarm
them
when
a
rescuer
shouted
will
stutely
s
clear
voice
on
one
side
of
them
and
a
rescue
bellowed
little
john
s
on
the
other
and
down
through
the
crowd
rushed
fourscore
men
in
lincoln
green
their
force
seeming
twice
that
number
in
the
confusion
with
swords
drawn
they
fell
upon
the
guard
from
every
side
at
once
there
was
a
brief
clash
of
hot
weapons
then
the
guard
scattered
wildly
and
robin
hood
s
men
formed
in
a
compact
mass
around
their
leader
and
forced
their
way
slowly
down
the
seize
them
in
the
king
s
name
shrieked
the
sheriff
close
the
gates
in
truth
the
peril
would
have
been
even
greater
had
this
last
order
been
carried
out
but
will
scarlet
and
had
foreseen
that
event
and
had
already
overpowered
the
two
warders
so
the
gates
stood
wide
open
and
toward
them
the
band
of
outlaws
headed
the
soldiers
rallied
a
force
of
twice
their
number
and
tried
resolutely
to
pierce
their
center
but
the
retreating
force
turned
thrice
and
sent
such
volleys
of
keen
arrows
from
their
good
yew
bows
that
they
kept
a
distance
between
the
two
forces
and
thus
the
gate
was
reached
and
the
long
road
leading
up
the
hill
and
at
last
the
protecting
greenwood
itself
the
soldiers
dared
come
no
farther
and
the
widow
s
three
sons
i
warrant
you
supped
more
heartily
that
night
than
ever
before
in
their
whole
lives
chapter
x
how
a
beggar
filled
the
public
eye
good
robin
accost
him
in
his
way
to
see
what
he
might
be
if
any
beggar
had
money
he
thought
some
part
had
he
one
bright
morning
soon
after
the
stirring
events
told
in
the
last
chapter
robin
wandered
forth
alone
down
the
road
to
barnesdale
to
see
if
aught
had
come
of
the
sheriff
s
pursuit
but
all
was
still
and
serene
and
peaceful
no
one
was
in
sight
save
a
solitary
beggar
who
came
sturdily
along
his
way
in
robin
s
direction
the
beggar
caught
sight
of
robin
at
the
same
moment
as
he
emerged
from
the
trees
but
gave
no
sign
of
having
seen
him
he
neither
slackened
nor
quickened
his
pace
but
jogged
forward
merrily
whistling
as
he
came
and
beating
time
by
punching
holes
in
the
dusty
road
with
the
stout
in
his
hand
the
curious
look
of
the
fellow
arrested
robin
s
attention
and
he
decided
to
stop
and
talk
with
him
the
fellow
was
and
and
wore
a
long
shift
of
a
shirt
fastened
with
a
belt
about
his
neck
hung
a
stout
bulging
bag
which
was
buckled
by
a
good
piece
of
leather
thong
he
had
three
hats
upon
his
head
together
sticked
fast
he
cared
neither
for
the
wind
nor
wet
in
lands
where
er
he
past
the
fellow
looked
so
fat
and
hearty
and
the
wallet
on
his
shoulder
seemed
so
well
filled
that
robin
thought
within
himself
ha
this
is
a
lucky
beggar
for
me
if
any
of
them
have
money
this
is
the
chap
and
marry
he
should
share
it
with
us
poorer
so
he
flourished
his
own
stick
and
planted
himself
in
the
traveler
s
path
sirrah
fellow
quoth
he
whither
away
so
fast
tarry
for
i
would
have
speech
with
ye
the
beggar
made
as
though
he
heard
him
not
and
kept
straight
on
with
his
faring
tarry
i
say
fellow
said
robin
again
for
there
s
a
way
to
make
folks
obey
nay
tis
not
so
answered
the
beggar
speaking
for
the
first
time
i
obey
no
man
in
all
england
not
even
the
king
himself
so
let
me
pass
on
my
way
for
tis
growing
late
and
i
have
still
far
to
go
before
i
can
care
for
my
stomach
s
now
by
my
troth
said
robin
once
more
getting
in
front
of
the
other
i
see
well
by
your
fat
countenance
that
you
lack
not
for
good
food
while
i
go
hungry
therefore
you
must
lend
me
of
your
means
till
we
meet
again
so
that
i
may
hie
to
the
nearest
i
have
no
money
to
lend
said
the
beggar
crossly
methinks
you
are
as
young
a
man
as
i
and
as
well
able
to
earn
a
supper
so
go
your
way
and
i
ll
go
mine
if
you
fast
till
you
get
aught
out
of
me
you
ll
go
hungry
for
the
next
not
while
i
have
a
stout
stick
to
thwack
your
saucy
bones
cried
robin
stand
and
deliver
i
say
or
i
ll
dust
your
shirt
for
you
and
if
that
will
not
teach
you
manners
then
we
ll
see
what
a
broad
arrow
can
do
with
a
beggar
s
skin
the
beggar
smiled
and
answered
boast
with
boast
come
on
with
your
staff
fellow
i
care
no
more
for
it
than
for
a
pudding
stick
and
as
for
your
pretty
bow
for
it
and
with
amazing
quickness
he
swung
his
around
and
knocked
robin
s
bow
clean
out
of
his
hand
so
that
his
fingers
smarted
with
pain
robin
danced
and
tried
to
bring
his
own
staff
into
action
but
the
beggar
never
gave
him
a
chance
biff
whack
came
the
smiting
him
soundly
and
beating
down
his
guard
there
were
but
two
things
to
do
either
stand
there
and
take
a
sound
drubbing
or
beat
a
hasty
retreat
robin
chose
the
latter
as
you
or
i
would
probably
have
done
and
scurried
back
into
the
wood
blowing
his
horn
as
he
went
fie
for
shame
man
jeered
the
bold
beggar
after
him
what
is
your
haste
we
had
but
just
begun
stay
and
take
your
money
else
you
will
never
be
able
to
pay
your
reckoning
at
the
tavern
but
robin
answered
him
never
a
word
he
fled
up
hill
and
down
dale
till
he
met
three
of
his
men
who
were
running
up
in
answer
to
his
summons
what
is
wrong
they
asked
tis
a
saucy
beggar
said
robin
catching
his
breath
he
is
back
there
on
the
highroad
with
the
hardest
stick
i
ve
met
in
a
good
many
days
he
gave
me
no
chance
to
reason
with
him
the
dirty
scamp
the
men
much
and
two
of
the
widow
s
sons
could
scarce
conceal
their
mirth
at
the
thought
of
robin
hood
running
from
a
beggar
nathless
they
kept
grave
faces
and
asked
their
leader
if
he
was
hurt
nay
he
replied
but
i
shall
speedily
feel
better
if
you
will
fetch
me
that
same
beggar
and
let
me
have
a
fair
chance
at
so
the
three
yeomen
made
haste
and
came
out
upon
the
highroad
and
followed
after
the
beggar
who
was
going
smoothly
along
his
way
again
as
though
he
were
at
peace
with
all
the
world
the
easiest
way
to
settle
this
beggar
said
much
is
to
surprise
him
let
us
cut
through
yon
neck
of
woods
and
come
upon
him
before
he
is
the
others
agreed
to
this
and
the
three
were
soon
close
upon
their
prey
now
quoth
much
and
the
other
two
sprang
quickly
upon
the
beggar
s
back
and
wrested
his
from
his
hand
at
the
same
moment
much
drew
his
dagger
and
flashed
it
before
the
fellow
s
breast
yield
you
my
man
cried
he
for
a
friend
of
ours
awaits
you
in
the
wood
to
teach
you
how
to
fight
give
me
a
fair
chance
said
the
beggar
valiantly
and
i
ll
fight
you
all
at
but
they
would
not
listen
to
him
instead
they
turned
him
about
and
began
to
march
him
toward
the
forest
seeing
that
it
was
useless
to
struggle
the
beggar
began
to
parley
good
my
masters
quoth
he
why
use
this
violence
i
will
go
with
ye
safe
and
quietly
if
ye
insist
but
if
ye
will
set
me
free
i
ll
make
it
worth
your
while
i
ve
a
hundred
pounds
in
my
bag
here
let
me
go
my
way
and
ye
shall
have
all
that
s
in
the
the
three
outlaws
took
council
together
at
this
what
say
you
asked
much
of
the
others
our
master
will
be
more
glad
to
see
this
beggar
s
wallet
than
his
sorry
the
other
two
agreed
and
the
little
party
came
to
a
halt
and
loosed
hold
of
the
beggar
count
out
your
gold
speedily
friend
said
much
there
was
a
brisk
wind
blowing
and
the
beggar
turned
about
to
face
it
directly
they
had
unhanded
him
it
shall
be
done
gossips
said
he
one
of
you
lend
me
your
cloak
and
we
will
spread
it
upon
the
ground
and
put
the
wealth
upon
the
cloak
was
handed
him
and
he
placed
his
wallet
upon
it
as
though
it
were
very
heavy
indeed
then
he
crouched
down
and
fumbled
with
the
leather
fastenings
the
outlaws
also
bent
over
and
watched
the
proceeding
closely
lest
he
should
hide
some
of
the
money
on
his
person
presently
he
got
the
bag
unfastened
and
plunged
his
hands
into
it
forth
from
it
he
drew
not
shining
gold
but
handfuls
of
fine
meal
which
he
dashed
into
the
eager
faces
of
the
men
around
him
the
wind
aided
him
in
this
and
soon
there
arose
a
blinding
cloud
which
filled
the
eyes
noses
and
mouths
of
the
three
outlaws
till
they
could
scarcely
see
or
breathe
while
they
gasped
and
choked
and
sputtered
and
felt
around
wildly
for
that
rogue
of
a
beggar
he
finished
the
job
by
picking
up
the
cloak
by
its
corners
and
shaking
it
vigorously
in
the
faces
of
his
suffering
victims
then
he
seized
a
stick
which
lay
conveniently
near
and
began
to
rain
blows
down
upon
their
heads
shoulders
and
sides
all
the
time
dancing
first
on
one
leg
then
on
the
other
and
crying
villains
rascals
here
are
the
hundred
pounds
i
promised
how
do
you
like
them
i
faith
you
ll
get
all
that
s
in
the
whack
whack
whack
whack
went
the
stick
emphasizing
each
word
howls
of
pain
might
have
gone
up
from
the
sufferers
but
they
had
too
much
meal
in
their
throats
for
that
their
one
thought
was
to
flee
and
they
stumbled
off
blindly
down
the
road
the
beggar
following
them
a
little
way
to
give
them
a
few
parting
fare
ye
well
my
masters
he
said
finally
turning
the
other
way
and
when
next
i
come
along
the
barnesdale
road
i
hope
you
will
be
able
to
tell
gold
from
meal
dust
with
this
he
departed
an
easy
victor
and
again
went
whistling
on
his
way
while
the
three
outlaws
rubbed
the
meal
out
of
their
eyes
and
began
to
catch
their
breath
again
as
soon
as
they
could
look
around
them
clearly
they
beheld
robin
hood
leaning
against
a
tree
trunk
and
surveying
them
smilingly
he
had
recovered
his
own
spirits
in
full
measure
on
seeing
their
plight
god
save
ye
gossips
he
said
ye
must
in
sooth
have
gone
the
wrong
way
and
been
to
the
mill
from
the
looks
of
your
then
when
they
looked
shamefaced
and
answered
never
a
word
he
went
on
in
a
soft
voice
did
ye
see
aught
of
that
bold
beggar
i
sent
you
for
lately
in
sooth
master
responded
much
the
miller
s
son
we
heard
more
of
him
than
we
saw
him
he
filled
us
so
full
of
meal
that
i
shall
sweat
meal
for
a
week
i
was
born
in
a
mill
and
had
the
smell
of
meal
in
my
nostrils
from
my
very
birth
you
might
say
and
yet
never
before
did
i
see
such
a
quantity
of
the
stuff
in
so
small
and
he
sneezed
violently
how
was
that
asked
robin
demurely
why
we
laid
hold
of
the
beggar
as
you
did
order
when
he
offered
to
pay
for
his
release
out
of
the
bag
he
carried
upon
his
the
same
i
coveted
quoth
robin
as
if
to
himself
so
we
agreed
to
this
went
on
much
and
spread
a
cloak
down
and
he
opened
his
bag
and
shook
it
thereon
instantly
a
great
cloud
of
meal
filled
the
air
whereby
we
could
neither
see
nor
breathe
and
in
the
midst
of
this
cloud
he
vanished
like
a
but
not
before
he
left
certain
black
and
blue
spots
to
be
remembered
by
i
see
commented
robin
he
was
in
league
with
the
evil
one
said
one
of
the
widow
s
sons
rubbing
himself
ruefully
then
robin
laughed
outright
and
sat
him
down
upon
the
gnarled
root
of
a
tree
to
finish
his
merriment
four
bold
outlaws
put
to
rout
by
a
sorry
beggar
cried
he
i
can
laugh
at
ye
my
men
for
i
am
in
the
same
boat
with
ye
but
twould
never
do
to
have
this
tale
get
abroad
even
in
the
greenwood
how
that
we
could
not
hold
our
own
with
the
odds
in
our
favor
so
let
us
have
this
little
laugh
all
to
ourselves
and
no
one
else
need
be
the
wiser
the
others
saw
the
point
of
this
and
felt
better
directly
despite
their
itching
desire
to
get
hold
of
the
beggar
again
and
none
of
the
four
ever
told
of
the
adventure
but
the
beggar
must
have
boasted
of
it
at
the
next
tavern
or
a
little
bird
perched
among
the
branches
of
a
neighboring
oak
must
have
sung
of
it
for
it
got
abroad
as
such
tales
will
and
was
put
into
a
right
droll
ballad
which
i
warrant
you
the
four
outlaws
did
not
like
to
hear
chapter
xi
how
robin
hood
fought
guy
of
gisborne
i
dwell
by
dale
and
down
quoth
he
and
robin
to
take
i
m
sworn
and
when
i
am
called
by
my
right
name
i
am
guy
of
good
some
weeks
passed
after
the
rescue
of
the
widow
s
three
sons
weeks
spent
by
the
sheriff
in
the
vain
effort
to
entrap
robin
hood
and
his
men
for
robin
s
name
and
deeds
had
come
to
the
king
s
ears
in
london
town
and
he
sent
word
to
the
sheriff
to
capture
the
outlaw
under
penalty
of
losing
his
office
so
the
sheriff
tried
every
manner
of
means
to
surprise
robin
hood
in
the
forest
but
always
without
success
and
he
increased
the
price
put
upon
robin
s
head
in
the
hope
that
the
best
men
of
the
kingdom
could
be
induced
to
try
their
skill
at
a
capture
now
there
was
a
certain
guy
of
gisborne
a
hireling
knight
of
the
king
s
army
who
heard
of
robin
and
of
the
price
upon
his
head
sir
guy
was
one
of
the
best
men
at
the
bow
and
the
sword
in
all
the
king
s
service
but
his
heart
was
black
and
treacherous
he
obtained
the
king
s
leave
forthwith
to
seek
out
the
forester
and
armed
with
the
king
s
scroll
he
came
before
the
sheriff
at
nottingham
i
have
come
to
capture
robin
hood
quoth
he
and
mean
to
have
him
dead
or
right
gladly
would
i
aid
you
answered
the
sheriff
even
if
the
king
s
seal
were
not
sufficient
warrant
how
many
men
need
you
none
replied
sir
guy
for
i
am
convinced
that
forces
of
men
can
never
come
at
the
bold
robber
i
must
needs
go
alone
but
do
you
hold
your
men
in
readiness
at
barnesdale
and
when
you
hear
a
blast
from
this
silver
bugle
come
quickly
for
i
shall
have
the
sly
robin
within
my
very
good
said
the
sheriff
marry
it
shall
be
and
he
set
about
giving
orders
while
guy
of
gisborne
sallied
forth
disguised
now
as
luck
would
have
it
will
scarlet
and
little
john
had
gone
to
barnesdale
that
very
day
to
buy
suits
of
lincoln
green
for
certain
of
the
yeomen
who
had
come
out
at
the
knees
and
elbows
but
not
deeming
it
best
for
both
of
them
to
run
their
necks
into
a
noose
together
they
parted
just
outside
the
town
and
will
went
within
the
gates
while
john
tarried
and
watched
at
the
brow
of
the
hill
on
the
outside
presently
whom
should
he
see
but
this
same
will
flying
madly
forth
from
the
gates
again
closely
pursued
by
the
sheriff
and
threescore
men
over
the
moat
will
sprang
through
the
bushes
and
briars
across
the
swamp
over
stocks
and
stones
up
the
woodland
roads
in
long
leaps
like
a
scared
jack
rabbit
and
after
him
puffed
the
sheriff
and
his
men
their
force
scattering
out
in
the
flight
as
one
man
would
tumble
into
a
ditch
another
mire
up
in
the
swamp
another
trip
over
a
rolling
stone
and
still
others
sit
down
on
the
roadside
and
gasp
for
wind
like
fish
out
of
water
little
john
could
not
forbear
laughing
heartily
at
the
scene
though
he
knew
that
twould
be
anything
but
a
laughing
matter
if
will
should
stumble
and
in
truth
one
man
was
like
to
come
upon
him
it
was
the
best
runner
among
the
sheriff
s
men
he
had
come
within
twenty
feet
of
scarlet
and
was
leaping
upon
him
with
long
bounds
like
a
greyhound
when
john
rose
up
quickly
drew
his
bow
and
let
fly
one
of
his
fatal
shafts
it
would
have
been
better
for
to
have
been
abed
with
sorrow
says
the
ballad
than
to
be
that
day
in
the
greenwood
slade
to
meet
with
little
john
s
arrow
he
had
run
his
last
race
the
others
halted
a
moment
in
consternation
when
the
shaft
came
hurtling
down
from
the
hill
but
looking
up
they
beheld
none
save
little
john
and
with
a
cry
of
fierce
joy
they
turned
upon
him
meanwhile
will
scarlet
had
reached
the
brow
of
the
hill
and
sped
down
the
other
side
i
ll
just
send
one
more
little
message
of
regret
to
the
sheriff
said
little
john
before
i
join
but
this
foolhardy
deed
was
his
undoing
for
just
as
the
arrow
left
the
string
the
good
yew
bow
that
had
never
before
failed
him
snapped
in
twain
woe
worth
woe
worth
thee
wicked
wood
that
ere
thou
grew
on
a
tree
cursed
little
john
and
planted
his
feet
resolutely
in
the
earth
resolved
to
sell
the
path
dearly
for
the
soldiers
were
now
so
close
upon
him
that
he
dared
not
turn
and
a
right
good
account
of
himself
he
gave
that
day
dealing
with
each
man
as
he
came
up
according
to
his
merit
and
so
winded
were
the
pursuers
when
they
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
that
he
laid
out
the
first
ten
of
them
right
and
left
with
huge
blows
of
his
brawny
fist
but
if
five
men
can
do
more
than
three
a
score
can
overcome
one
a
body
of
archers
stood
off
at
a
prudent
distance
and
covered
little
john
with
their
arrows
now
yield
you
panted
the
sheriff
yield
you
little
john
or
reynold
greenleaf
or
whatever
else
name
you
carry
this
day
yield
you
or
some
few
of
these
shafts
will
reach
your
heart
marry
my
heart
has
been
touched
by
your
words
ere
now
said
little
john
and
i
yield
so
the
sheriff
s
men
laid
hold
of
little
john
and
bound
him
fast
with
many
cords
so
fearful
were
they
lest
he
should
escape
and
the
sheriff
laughed
aloud
in
glee
and
thought
of
how
he
should
avenge
his
stolen
plate
and
determined
to
make
a
good
day
s
work
of
it
by
the
saints
he
said
you
shall
be
drawn
by
dale
and
down
and
hanged
high
on
a
hill
in
barnesdale
this
very
hang
and
be
hanged
retorted
the
prisoner
you
may
fail
of
your
purpose
if
it
be
heaven
s
back
down
the
hill
and
across
the
moor
went
the
company
speedily
for
they
feared
a
rescue
and
as
they
went
the
stragglers
joined
them
here
a
man
got
up
feebly
out
of
the
ditch
and
rubbed
his
pate
and
fell
in
like
a
chicken
with
the
pip
going
for
its
dinner
yonder
came
hobbling
a
man
with
a
lame
ankle
or
another
with
his
shins
torn
by
the
briars
or
another
with
his
jacket
all
muddy
from
the
marsh
so
in
truth
it
was
a
tatterdemalion
crew
that
limped
and
straggled
and
wandered
back
into
barnesdale
that
day
yet
all
were
merry
for
the
sheriff
had
promised
them
flagons
of
wine
and
moreover
they
were
to
hang
speedily
the
boldest
outlaw
in
england
next
to
robin
hood
himself
the
gallows
was
quickly
put
up
and
a
new
rope
provided
now
up
with
you
commanded
the
sheriff
and
let
us
see
if
your
greenwood
tricks
will
avail
you
i
would
that
i
had
bold
robin
s
horn
muttered
poor
john
methinks
tis
all
up
with
me
even
as
the
sheriff
hath
in
good
sooth
the
time
was
dire
and
pressing
the
rope
was
placed
around
the
prisoner
s
neck
and
the
men
prepared
to
haul
away
are
you
ready
called
the
sheriff
one
two
but
before
the
three
left
his
lips
the
faint
sound
of
a
silver
bugle
came
floating
over
the
hill
by
my
troth
that
is
sir
guy
of
gisborne
s
horn
quoth
the
sheriff
and
he
bade
me
not
to
delay
answering
its
summons
he
has
caught
robin
pardon
excellency
said
one
of
his
men
but
if
he
has
caught
robin
hood
this
is
a
merry
day
indeed
and
let
us
save
this
fellow
and
build
another
gallows
and
hang
them
both
that
s
a
brave
thought
said
the
sheriff
slapping
his
knee
take
the
rascal
down
and
bind
him
fast
to
the
against
our
so
little
john
was
made
fast
to
the
while
the
sheriff
and
all
his
men
who
could
march
or
hobble
went
out
to
get
robin
hood
and
bring
him
in
for
the
double
hanging
let
us
leave
talking
of
little
john
and
the
sheriff
and
see
what
has
become
of
robin
hood
in
the
first
place
he
and
little
john
had
come
near
having
a
quarrel
that
morning
because
both
had
seen
a
curious
looking
yeoman
and
each
wanted
to
challenge
him
singly
but
robin
would
not
give
way
to
his
lieutenant
and
that
is
why
john
in
a
huff
had
gone
with
will
to
barnesdale
meanwhile
robin
approached
the
curious
looking
stranger
he
seemed
to
be
a
creature
at
first
sight
but
on
coming
nearer
you
would
have
seen
that
twas
really
naught
but
a
poorly
clad
man
who
for
a
freak
had
covered
up
his
rags
with
a
nothing
more
nor
less
than
the
skin
of
a
horse
complete
with
head
tail
and
mane
the
skin
of
the
head
made
a
helmet
while
the
tail
gave
the
curious
appearance
good
fellow
said
robin
cheerily
methinks
by
the
bow
you
bear
in
your
hand
that
you
should
be
a
good
indifferent
good
said
the
other
returning
his
greeting
but
tis
not
of
archery
that
i
am
thinking
this
morning
for
i
have
lost
my
way
and
would
fain
find
it
by
my
faith
i
could
have
believed
twas
your
wits
you
d
lost
thought
robin
smiling
then
aloud
i
ll
lead
you
through
the
wood
quoth
he
an
you
will
tell
me
your
business
for
belike
your
speech
is
much
gentler
than
your
who
are
you
to
ask
me
my
business
asked
the
other
roughly
i
am
one
of
the
king
s
rangers
replied
robin
set
here
to
guard
his
deer
against
curious
looking
curious
looking
i
may
be
returned
the
other
but
no
stroller
hark
ye
since
you
are
a
ranger
i
must
e
en
demand
your
service
i
am
on
the
king
s
business
and
seek
an
outlaw
men
call
him
robin
hood
are
you
one
of
his
men
eyeing
him
keenly
nay
god
forbid
said
robin
but
what
want
you
with
him
that
is
another
tale
but
i
d
rather
meet
with
that
proud
outlaw
than
forty
good
pounds
of
the
king
s
robin
now
saw
how
the
land
lay
come
with
me
good
yeoman
said
he
and
belike
a
little
later
in
the
day
i
can
show
you
robin
s
haunts
when
he
is
at
home
meanwhile
let
us
have
some
pastime
under
the
greenwood
tree
let
us
first
try
the
mastery
at
shooting
the
other
agreed
and
they
cut
down
two
willow
wands
of
a
summer
s
growth
that
grew
beneath
a
brier
and
set
them
up
at
a
distance
of
threescore
yards
lead
on
good
fellow
quoth
robin
the
first
shot
to
nay
by
my
faith
said
the
other
i
will
follow
your
so
robin
stepped
forth
and
bent
his
bow
carelessly
and
sent
his
shaft
whizzing
toward
the
wand
missing
it
by
a
scant
inch
he
of
the
followed
with
more
care
yet
was
a
good
breadth
away
on
the
second
round
the
stranger
led
off
and
landed
cleverly
within
the
small
garland
at
the
top
of
the
wand
but
robin
shot
far
better
and
clave
the
wand
itself
clean
at
the
middle
a
blessing
on
your
heart
shouted
never
saw
i
such
shooting
as
that
belike
you
are
better
than
robin
hood
himself
but
you
have
not
yet
told
me
your
nay
by
my
faith
quoth
robin
i
must
keep
it
secret
till
you
have
told
me
your
i
do
not
disdain
to
tell
it
said
the
other
i
dwell
by
dale
and
down
and
to
take
bold
robin
am
i
sworn
this
would
i
tell
him
to
his
face
were
he
not
so
great
a
craven
when
i
am
called
by
my
right
name
i
am
guy
of
this
he
said
with
a
great
show
of
pride
and
he
strutted
back
and
forth
forgetful
that
he
had
just
been
beaten
at
archery
robin
eyed
him
quietly
methinks
i
have
heard
of
you
elsewhere
do
you
not
bring
men
to
the
gallows
for
a
living
aye
but
only
outlaws
such
as
robin
but
pray
what
harm
has
robin
hood
done
you
he
is
a
highway
robber
said
sir
guy
evading
the
question
has
he
ever
taken
from
the
rich
that
he
did
not
give
again
to
the
poor
does
he
not
protect
the
women
and
children
and
side
with
weak
and
helpless
is
not
his
greatest
crime
the
shooting
of
a
few
king
s
deer
have
done
with
your
sophistry
said
sir
guy
impatiently
i
am
more
than
ever
of
opinion
that
you
are
one
of
robin
s
men
i
have
told
you
i
am
not
quoth
robin
briefly
but
if
i
am
to
help
you
catch
him
what
is
your
plan
do
you
see
this
silver
bugle
said
the
other
a
long
blast
upon
it
will
summon
the
sheriff
and
all
his
men
when
once
i
have
robin
within
my
grasp
and
if
you
show
him
to
me
i
ll
give
you
the
half
of
my
forty
pounds
i
would
not
help
hang
a
man
for
ten
times
forty
pounds
said
the
outlaw
yet
will
i
point
out
robin
to
you
for
the
reward
i
find
at
my
sword
s
point
i
myself
am
robin
hood
of
sherwood
and
then
have
at
you
cried
the
other
springing
swiftly
into
action
his
sword
leaped
forth
from
beneath
the
horse
s
hide
with
the
speed
born
of
long
practice
and
before
robin
had
come
to
guard
the
other
had
smitten
at
him
full
and
foul
robin
eluded
the
lunge
and
drew
his
own
weapon
a
scurvy
trick
quoth
he
grimly
to
strike
at
a
man
then
neither
spoke
more
but
fell
sternly
to
work
lunge
and
thrust
and
ward
and
parry
for
two
full
hours
the
weapons
smote
together
sullenly
and
neither
robin
hood
nor
sir
guy
would
yield
an
inch
i
promise
you
that
if
you
could
have
looked
forth
on
the
fight
from
behind
the
trunk
of
some
friendly
tree
you
would
have
seen
deadly
sport
such
as
few
men
beheld
in
sherwood
forest
for
the
fighters
glared
sullenly
at
each
other
the
fires
of
hatred
burning
in
their
eyes
one
was
fighting
for
his
life
the
other
for
a
reward
and
the
king
s
favor
still
circled
the
bright
blades
swiftly
in
the
air
now
gleaming
in
the
peaceful
sunlight
again
hissing
like
maddened
serpents
neither
had
yet
touched
the
other
until
robin
in
an
unlucky
moment
stumbled
over
the
projecting
root
of
a
tree
when
sir
guy
instead
of
giving
him
the
chance
to
recover
himself
as
any
courteous
knight
would
have
done
struck
quickly
at
the
falling
man
and
wounded
him
in
the
left
side
ah
dear
lady
in
heaven
gasped
robin
uttering
his
favorite
prayer
shield
me
now
twas
never
a
man
s
destiny
to
die
before
his
and
adroitly
he
sprang
up
again
and
came
straight
at
the
other
with
an
awkward
but
unexpected
stroke
the
knight
had
raised
his
weapon
high
to
give
a
final
blow
when
robin
reached
beneath
and
across
his
guard
one
swift
lunge
and
sir
guy
of
gisborne
staggered
backward
with
a
deep
groan
robin
s
sword
through
his
throat
robin
looked
at
the
slain
man
regretfully
you
did
bring
it
upon
yourself
said
he
and
traitor
and
hireling
though
you
were
i
would
not
willingly
have
killed
he
looked
to
his
own
wound
it
was
not
serious
and
he
soon
staunched
the
blood
and
bound
up
the
cut
then
he
dragged
the
dead
body
into
the
bushes
and
took
off
the
horse
s
hide
and
put
it
upon
himself
he
placed
his
own
cloak
upon
sir
guy
and
marked
his
face
so
none
might
tell
who
had
been
slain
robin
s
own
figure
and
face
were
not
unlike
the
other
s
pulling
the
well
over
himself
so
that
the
helmet
hid
most
of
his
face
robin
seized
the
silver
bugle
and
blew
a
long
blast
it
was
the
blast
that
saved
the
life
of
little
john
over
in
barnesdale
for
you
and
i
have
already
seen
how
it
caused
the
fond
sheriff
to
prick
up
his
ears
and
stay
the
hanging
and
go
scurrying
up
over
the
hill
and
into
the
wood
with
his
men
in
search
of
another
victim
in
minutes
up
came
running
a
score
of
the
sheriff
s
best
archers
did
you
signal
us
lording
they
asked
approaching
robin
aye
said
he
going
to
meet
the
puffing
sheriff
what
news
what
news
sir
guy
said
that
officer
robin
hood
and
guy
of
gisborne
had
a
fight
and
he
that
wears
robin
s
cloak
lies
under
the
covert
the
best
news
i
have
heard
in
all
my
life
exclaimed
the
sheriff
rubbing
his
hands
i
would
that
we
could
have
saved
him
for
the
hanging
though
i
can
not
now
the
hanging
repeated
robin
yes
this
is
our
lucky
day
on
the
calendar
after
you
left
me
we
narrowly
missed
running
one
of
the
fellows
i
believe
twas
will
scarlet
to
earth
and
another
who
came
to
his
relief
we
were
just
about
to
hang
when
your
horn
who
was
the
other
asked
the
disguised
outlaw
whom
do
you
suppose
laughed
the
sheriff
the
best
man
in
the
greenwood
next
to
robin
hood
himself
little
john
reynold
greenleaf
for
the
sheriff
could
not
forget
the
name
little
john
had
borne
under
his
own
roof
at
nottingham
little
john
thought
robin
with
a
start
verily
that
was
a
lucky
blast
of
the
bugle
but
i
see
you
have
not
escaped
without
a
scratch
continued
the
sheriff
becoming
talkative
through
pure
glee
here
one
of
you
men
give
sir
guy
of
gisborne
your
horse
while
others
of
you
bury
that
dog
of
an
outlaw
where
he
lies
and
let
us
hasten
back
to
barnesdale
and
finish
hanging
the
so
they
put
spurs
to
their
horses
and
as
they
rode
robin
forced
himself
to
talk
merrily
while
all
the
time
he
was
planning
the
best
way
to
succor
little
john
a
boon
sheriff
he
said
as
they
reached
the
gates
of
the
town
what
is
it
worthy
sir
you
have
but
to
i
do
not
want
any
of
your
gold
for
i
have
had
a
brave
fight
but
now
that
i
have
slain
the
master
let
me
put
an
end
to
the
man
so
it
shall
be
said
that
guy
of
gisborne
despatched
the
two
greatest
outlaws
of
england
in
one
have
it
as
you
will
said
the
sheriff
but
you
should
have
asked
a
knight
s
fee
and
double
your
reward
and
it
would
have
been
yours
it
isn
t
every
man
that
can
take
robin
no
excellency
answered
robin
i
say
it
without
boasting
that
no
man
took
robin
hood
yesterday
and
none
shall
take
him
then
he
approached
little
john
who
was
still
tied
to
the
and
he
said
to
the
sheriff
s
men
now
stand
you
back
here
till
i
see
if
the
prisoner
has
been
and
he
stooped
swiftly
and
cut
little
john
s
bonds
and
thrust
into
his
hands
sir
guy
s
bow
and
arrows
which
he
had
been
careful
to
take
tis
i
robin
he
whispered
but
in
truth
little
john
knew
it
already
and
had
decided
there
was
to
be
no
hanging
that
day
then
robin
blew
three
loud
blasts
upon
his
own
horn
and
drew
forth
his
own
bow
and
before
the
astonished
sheriff
and
his
men
could
come
to
arms
the
arrows
were
whistling
in
their
midst
in
no
uncertain
fashion
and
look
through
the
gates
and
over
the
walls
came
pouring
another
flight
of
arrows
will
scarlet
and
will
stutely
had
watched
and
planned
a
rescue
ever
since
the
sheriff
and
robin
rode
back
down
the
hill
now
in
good
time
they
came
and
the
sheriff
s
demoralized
force
turned
tail
and
ran
while
robin
and
little
john
stood
under
the
harmless
gallows
and
sped
swift
arrows
after
them
and
laughed
to
see
them
go
then
they
joined
their
comrades
and
hasted
back
to
the
good
greenwood
and
there
rested
they
had
got
enough
sport
for
one
day
chapter
xii
how
maid
marian
came
back
to
sherwood
forest
also
how
robin
hood
came
before
queen
eleanor
but
robin
hood
he
himself
had
disguis
d
and
marian
was
strangely
attir
d
that
they
proved
foes
and
so
fell
to
blows
whose
valor
bold
robin
admir
d
and
when
he
came
at
london
s
court
he
fell
down
on
his
knee
thou
art
welcome
lockesley
said
the
queen
and
all
thy
good
now
it
fell
out
that
one
day
not
long
thereafter
robin
was
minded
to
try
his
skill
at
hunting
and
not
knowing
whom
he
might
meet
in
his
rambles
he
stained
his
face
and
put
on
a
jacket
and
a
long
cloak
before
he
sallied
forth
as
he
walked
the
peacefulness
of
the
morning
came
upon
him
and
brought
back
to
his
memory
the
early
days
so
long
ago
when
he
had
roamed
these
same
glades
with
marian
how
sweet
they
seemed
to
him
now
and
how
far
away
marian
too
the
dainty
friend
of
his
youth
would
he
ever
see
her
again
he
had
thought
of
her
very
often
of
late
and
each
time
with
increasing
desire
to
hear
her
clear
voice
and
musical
laugh
and
see
her
eyes
light
up
at
his
coming
perhaps
the
happiness
of
and
his
lady
had
caused
robin
s
to
vibrate
more
strongly
perhaps
too
the
coming
of
will
scarlet
but
certes
robin
was
anything
but
a
hunter
this
bright
morning
as
he
walked
along
with
head
drooping
in
a
most
way
presently
a
hart
entered
the
glade
in
full
view
of
him
grazing
peacefully
and
instantly
the
man
of
action
awoke
his
bow
was
drawn
and
a
shaft
all
but
loosed
when
the
beast
fell
suddenly
pierced
by
a
clever
arrow
from
the
far
side
of
the
glade
then
a
handsome
little
page
sprang
gleefully
from
the
covert
and
ran
toward
the
dying
animal
this
was
plainly
the
archer
for
he
flourished
his
bow
aloft
and
likewise
bore
a
sword
at
his
side
though
for
all
that
he
looked
a
mere
lad
robin
approached
the
hart
from
the
other
side
how
dare
you
shoot
the
king
s
beasts
stripling
he
asked
severely
i
have
as
much
right
to
shoot
them
as
the
king
himself
answered
the
page
haughtily
how
dare
you
question
me
the
voice
stirred
robin
strongly
it
seemed
to
chime
into
his
memories
of
the
old
days
he
looked
at
the
page
sharply
and
the
other
returned
the
glance
straight
and
unafraid
who
are
you
my
lad
robin
said
more
civilly
no
lad
of
yours
and
my
name
s
my
own
retorted
the
other
with
spirit
softly
fair
and
softly
sweet
page
or
we
of
the
forest
will
have
to
teach
you
manners
said
robin
not
if
stand
for
the
forest
cried
the
page
whipping
out
his
sword
come
draw
and
defend
yourself
he
swung
his
blade
valiantly
and
robin
saw
nothing
for
it
but
to
draw
likewise
the
page
thereupon
engaged
him
quite
fiercely
and
robin
found
that
he
had
many
pretty
little
tricks
at
fencing
nathless
robin
contented
himself
with
parrying
and
was
loth
to
exert
all
his
superior
strength
upon
the
lad
so
the
fight
lasted
for
above
a
quarter
of
an
hour
at
the
end
of
which
time
the
page
was
almost
spent
and
the
hot
blood
flushed
his
cheeks
in
a
most
charming
manner
the
outlaw
saw
his
distress
and
to
end
the
fight
allowed
himself
to
be
pricked
slightly
on
the
wrist
are
you
satisfied
fellow
asked
the
page
wincing
a
little
at
sight
of
the
blood
aye
honestly
replied
robin
and
now
perhaps
you
will
grant
me
the
honor
of
knowing
to
whom
i
owe
this
scratch
i
am
richard
partington
page
to
her
majesty
queen
eleanor
answered
the
lad
with
dignity
and
again
the
sound
of
his
voice
troubled
robin
sorely
why
come
you
to
the
greenwood
alone
master
partington
the
lad
considered
his
answer
while
wiping
his
sword
with
a
small
lace
kerchief
the
action
brought
a
dim
confused
memory
to
robin
the
lad
finally
looked
him
again
in
the
eye
forester
whether
or
no
you
be
a
king
s
man
know
that
i
seek
one
robin
hood
an
outlaw
to
whom
i
bring
amnesty
from
the
queen
can
you
tell
me
aught
of
him
and
while
awaiting
his
answer
he
replaced
the
kerchief
in
his
shirt
as
he
did
so
the
gleam
of
a
golden
trophy
caught
the
outlaw
s
eye
robin
started
forward
with
a
joyful
cry
ah
i
know
you
now
by
the
sight
of
yon
golden
arrow
won
at
the
sheriff
s
tourney
you
are
she
on
whom
i
bestowed
it
and
none
other
than
maid
marian
you
are
gasped
marian
for
it
was
she
not
robin
robin
s
self
said
he
gaily
and
forthwith
clad
as
he
was
in
rags
and
stained
of
face
he
clasped
the
dainty
page
close
to
his
breast
and
she
forsooth
yielded
right
willingly
but
robin
she
exclaimed
presently
i
knew
you
not
and
was
rude
and
wounded
you
twas
nothing
he
replied
laughingly
so
long
as
it
brought
me
but
she
made
more
ado
over
the
sore
wrist
than
robin
had
received
for
all
his
former
hurts
put
together
and
she
bound
it
with
the
little
kerchief
and
said
now
twill
get
well
and
robin
was
convinced
she
spoke
the
truth
for
he
never
felt
better
in
all
his
life
the
whole
woods
seemed
tinged
with
a
roseate
hue
since
marian
had
come
again
but
she
while
happy
also
was
ill
at
ease
and
robin
with
a
man
s
slow
discernment
at
last
saw
that
it
was
because
of
her
boy
s
attire
he
thought
bluntly
that
there
was
naught
to
be
ashamed
of
yet
smilingly
handed
her
his
tattered
long
cloak
which
she
blushingly
put
on
and
forthwith
recovered
her
spirits
directly
then
they
began
to
talk
of
each
other
s
varied
fortunes
and
of
the
many
things
which
had
parted
them
and
so
much
did
they
find
to
tell
that
the
sun
had
begun
to
decline
well
into
the
afternoon
before
they
realized
how
the
hours
sped
i
am
but
a
sorry
host
exclaimed
robin
springing
to
his
feet
i
have
not
once
invited
you
to
my
wild
and
i
am
but
a
sorry
page
replied
marian
for
i
had
clean
forgot
that
i
was
richard
partington
and
really
did
bring
you
a
message
from
queen
eleanor
tell
me
on
our
way
home
and
there
you
shall
be
entrusted
to
mistress
dale
while
the
first
of
my
men
we
meet
will
i
send
back
for
your
so
she
told
him
as
they
walked
back
through
the
glade
how
that
the
fame
of
his
prowess
had
reached
queen
eleanor
s
ears
in
london
town
and
the
queen
had
said
fain
would
i
see
this
bold
yeoman
and
behold
his
skill
at
the
and
the
queen
had
promised
him
amnesty
if
he
and
four
of
his
archers
would
repair
to
london
against
the
next
tournament
the
week
following
there
to
shoot
against
king
henry
s
picked
men
of
whom
the
king
was
right
vain
all
this
marian
told
in
detail
and
added
when
i
heard
her
majesty
say
she
desired
to
see
you
i
asked
leave
to
go
in
search
of
you
saying
i
had
known
you
once
and
the
queen
was
right
glad
and
bade
me
go
and
sent
this
gold
ring
to
you
from
off
her
finger
in
token
of
her
then
robin
took
the
ring
and
bowed
his
head
and
kissed
it
loyally
by
this
token
will
i
go
to
london
town
quoth
he
and
ere
i
part
with
the
queen
s
pledge
may
the
hand
that
bears
it
be
stricken
off
at
the
wrist
by
this
time
they
were
come
to
the
grove
before
the
cave
and
robin
presented
maid
marian
to
the
band
who
treated
her
with
the
greatest
respect
will
scarlet
was
especially
delighted
to
greet
again
his
old
time
friend
while
and
his
good
wife
bustled
about
to
make
her
welcome
in
their
tiny
thatched
cottage
that
evening
after
they
had
supped
royally
upon
the
very
hart
that
marian
had
slain
allan
sang
sweet
songs
of
northern
minstrelsy
to
the
fair
guest
as
she
sat
by
robin
s
side
the
golden
arrow
gleaming
in
her
dark
hair
the
others
all
joined
in
the
chorus
from
will
scarlet
s
baritone
to
friar
tuck
s
heavy
bass
even
little
john
essayed
to
sing
although
looked
at
threateningly
by
much
the
miller
s
son
then
robin
bade
marian
repeat
her
message
from
the
queen
which
marian
did
in
a
way
befitting
the
dignity
of
her
royal
mistress
after
which
the
yeomen
gave
three
cheers
for
the
queen
and
three
more
for
her
page
and
drank
toasts
to
them
both
rising
to
their
feet
ye
have
heard
quoth
robin
standing
forth
how
that
her
majesty
whom
god
preserve
wishes
but
four
men
to
go
with
me
wherefore
i
choose
little
john
and
will
stutely
my
two
lieutenants
will
scarlet
my
cousin
and
my
minstrel
mistress
dale
also
can
go
with
her
husband
and
be
company
for
the
queen
s
page
we
will
depart
with
early
morning
decked
in
our
finest
so
stir
ye
my
lads
and
see
that
not
only
your
tunics
are
fresh
but
your
swords
bright
and
your
bows
and
arrows
fit
for
we
must
be
a
credit
to
the
queen
as
well
as

good
greenwood

much
with
stout
will
lester
and
john

widow

three
sons
shall
have
command
of
the
band
while
we
are
away
and
friar
tuck
shall
preside
over
the
needs
of
your
souls
and
the
orders
were
received
with
shouts
of
approval
and
toasts
all
around
were
drunk
again
in
ale
ere
the
company
dispersed
to
rest
after
making
ready
for
the
journey
the
next
morning
was
as
fine
a
summer
s
day
as
ever
you
want
to
see
and
the
green
leaves
of
the
forest
made
a
pleasing
background
for
the
gay
picture
of
the
yeomen
setting
forth
says
the
old
ballad
it
was
a
seemly
sight
to
see
how
robin
hood
himself
had
dressed
and
all
his
yeomanry
he
clothed
his
men
in
lincoln
green
and
himself
in
scarlet
red
with
hats
of
black
and
feathers
white
to
bravely
deck
each
head
nor
were
the
two
ladies
i
ween
at
the
bedecking
thus
the
chosen
party
of
seven
sallied
forth
being
accompanied
to
the
edge
of
the
wood
by
the
whole
band
who
gave
them
a
merry
parting
and
godspeed
the
journey
to
london
town
was
made
without
incident
the
party
proceeded
boldly
along
the
king
s
highroad
and
no
man
met
them
who
was
disposed
to
say
them
nay
besides
the
good
queen
s
warrant
and
ring
would
have
answered
for
them
as
indeed
it
did
at
the
gates
of
london
so
on
they
sped
and
in
due
course
came
to
the
palace
itself
and
awaited
audience
with
the
queen
now
the
king
had
gone
that
day
to
finsbury
field
where
the
tourney
was
soon
to
be
held
in
order
to
look
over
the
lists
and
see
some
of
his
picked
men
whom
he
expected
to
win
against
all
comers
so
much
had
he
boasted
of
these
men
that
the
queen
had
secretly
resolved
to
win
a
wager
of
him
she
had
heard
of
the
fame
of
robin
hood
and
his
yeomen
as
marian
had
said
and
marian
on
her
part
had
been
overjoyed
to
be
able
to
add
a
word
in
their
favor
and
to
set
out
in
search
of
them
the
queen
sat
in
her
private
chatting
pleasantly
with
her
ladies
when
in
came
mistress
marian
fitzwalter
attired
again
as
befitted
her
rank
of
she
courtesied
low
to
the
queen
and
awaited
permission
to
speak
how
now
said
the
queen
smiling
is
this
my
lady
marian
or
the
page
richard
partington
both
an
it
please
your
majesty
richard
found
the
man
you
sought
while
marian
brought
him
to
where
is
he
asked
queen
eleanor
eagerly
awaiting
your
audience
he
and
four
of
his
men
likewise
a
lady
of
whose
wooing
and
wedding
i
can
tell
you
a
pretty
story
at
another
have
them
so
marian
gave
orders
to
a
herald
and
presently
robin
hood
and
his
little
party
entered
the
room
now
the
queen
had
the
men
to
be
rude
and
uncouth
in
appearance
because
of
their
wild
life
in
the
forest
but
she
was
delightfully
disappointed
indeed
she
started
back
in
surprise
and
almost
clapped
her
hands
for
sooth
to
say
the
yeomen
made
a
brave
sight
and
in
all
the
court
no
more
gallant
men
could
be
found
marian
felt
her
cheeks
glow
with
pride
at
sight
of
the
looks
of
admiration
sent
forth
by
the
other
robin
had
not
forgot
the
gentle
arts
taught
by
his
mother
and
he
wore
his
fine
red
velvet
tunic
and
breeches
with
the
grace
of
a
courtier
we
have
seen
before
what
a
dandified
gentleman
will
scarlet
was
and
the
minstrel
was
scarcely
less
goodly
to
look
upon
while
the
giant
little
john
and
will
stutely
made
up
in
stature
what
little
they
lacked
in
outward
polish
mistress
dale
on
her
part
looked
even
more
charming
if
possible
than
on
the
momentous
day
when
she
went
to
plympton
church
to
marry
one
man
and
found
another
thus
came
the
people
of
the
greenwood
before
queen
eleanor
in
her
own
private
audience
room
and
robin
advanced
and
knelt
down
before
her
and
said
here
i
am
robin
hood
i
and
my
chosen
men
at
your
majesty
s
bidding
am
i
come
bearing
the
ring
of
amnesty
which
i
will
protect
as
i
would
protect
your
majesty
s
honor
with
my
life
thou
art
welcome
lockesley
said
the
queen
smiling
graciously
thou
art
come
in
good
time
thou
and
all
thy
brave
then
robin
presented
each
of
his
men
in
turn
and
each
fell
on
his
knee
and
was
greeted
with
most
kindly
words
and
the
queen
kissed
fair
mistress
dale
upon
the
cheek
and
bade
her
remain
in
the
palace
with
her
ladies
while
she
was
in
the
city
and
she
made
all
the
party
be
seated
to
rest
themselves
after
their
long
journey
fine
wines
were
brought
and
cake
and
rich
food
for
their
refreshment
and
as
they
ate
and
drank
the
queen
told
them
further
of
the
tourney
to
be
held
at
finsbury
field
and
of
how
she
desired
them
to
wear
her
colors
and
shoot
for
her
meantime
she
concluded
they
were
to
lie
by
quietly
and
be
known
of
no
man
to
do
all
this
robin
and
his
men
pledged
themselves
full
heartily
then
at
the
queen
s
request
they
related
to
her
and
her
ladies
some
of
their
merry
adventures
whereat
the
listeners
were
vastly
entertained
and
laughed
heartily
then
marian
who
had
heard
of
the
wedding
at
plympton
church
told
it
so
drolly
that
tears
stood
in
the
queen
s
eyes
from
merriment
my
lord
bishop
of
hereford
she
said
twas
indeed
a
comical
business
for
him
i
shall
keep
that
to
twit
his
bones
i
promise
you
so
this
is
our
minstrel
she
added
presently
turning
to
methinks
i
have
already
heard
of
him
will
he
not
harp
awhile
for
us
allan
bowed
low
and
took
a
harp
which
was
brought
to
him
and
he
thrummed
the
strings
and
sang
full
sweetly
the
border
songs
of
the
north
countree
and
the
queen
and
all
her
ladies
listened
in
rapt
silence
till
all
the
songs
were
ended

in

and
after

and
all
his
yeomen
gay
the
morning
of
the
great
archery
contest
dawned
fair
and
bright
bringing
with
it
a
fever
of
impatience
to
every
citizen
of
london
town
from
the
proudest
courtier
to
the
lowest
kitchen
wench
aye
and
all
the
surrounding
country
was
early
awake
too
and
began
to
wend
their
way
to
finsbury
field
a
fine
broad
stretch
of
practice
ground
near
moorfields
around
three
sides
of
the
field
were
erected
tier
upon
tier
of
seats
for
the
spectators
with
the
royal
boxes
and
booths
for
the
nobility
and
gentry
in
the
center
down
along
one
end
were
pitched
gaily
colored
tents
for
the
different
bands
of
king
s
archers
there
were
ten
of
these
bands
each
containing
a
score
of
men
headed
by
a
captain
of
great
renown
so
there
were
ten
of
the
pavilions
each
bearing
aloft
the
royal
arms
and
pennants
which
fluttered
lightly
in
the
fresh
morning
breeze
each
captain
s
flag
was
of
peculiar
color
and
device
first
came
the
royal
purple
streamer
of
tepus
own
to
the
king
and
esteemed
the
finest
archer
in
all
the
land
then
came
the
yellow
of
clifton
of
buckinghamshire
and
the
blue
of
gilbert
of
the
white
hand
he
who
was
renowned
in
nottinghamshire
and
the
green
of
elwyn
the
welshman
and
the
white
of
robert
of
cloudesdale
and
after
them
five
other
captains
of
bands
each
a
man
of
proved
prowess
as
the
queen
had
said
aforetime
the
king
was
mightily
proud
of
his
archers
and
now
held
this
tourney
to
show
their
skill
and
mayhap
to
recruit
their
forces
the
uprising
tiers
of
seats
filled
early
upon
this
summer
morning
and
the
merry
chatter
of
the
people
went
abroad
like
the
hum
of
bees
in
a
hive
the
royal
party
had
not
yet
put
in
an
appearance
nor
were
any
of
the
king
s
archers
visible
so
the
crowd
was
content
to
hide
its
impatience
by
laughing
jibes
passed
from
one
section
to
another
and
crying
the
colors
of
their
favorite
archers
in
and
out
among
the
seats
went
hawkers
their
arms
laden
with
small
pennants
to
correspond
with
the
rival
tents
other
vendors
of
pie
and
small
cakes
and
cider
also
did
a
thrifty
business
for
so
eager
had
some
of
the
people
been
to
get
good
seats
that
they
had
rushed
away
from
home
without
their
breakfast
suddenly
the
gates
at
the
far
end
next
the
tents
opened
wide
and
a
courier
in
scarlet
and
gold
mounted
upon
a
white
horse
rode
in
blowing
lustily
upon
the
trumpet
at
his
lips
and
behind
him
came
six
riding
abreast
the
populace
arose
with
a
mighty
cheer
king
harry
had
entered
the
arena
he
bestrode
a
fine
white
charger
and
was
clad
in
a
rich
dark
suit
of
slashed
velvet
with
satin
and
gold
facings
his
hat
bore
a
long
curling
ostrich
plume
of
pure
white
and
he
doffed
it
graciously
in
answer
to
the
shouts
of
the
people
by
his
side
rode
queen
eleanor
looking
regal
and
charming
in
her
long
brocade
while
immediately
behind
them
came
prince
richard
and
prince
john
each
attired
in
knightly
coats
of
mail
and
helmets
lords
and
ladies
of
the
realm
followed
and
finally
the
ten
companies
of
archers
whose
progress
round
the
field
was
greeted
with
hardly
less
applause
than
that
given
the
king
himself
the
king
and
queen
dismounted
from
their
steeds
ascended
the
steps
of
the
royal
box
and
seated
themselves
upon
two
thrones
decked
with
purple
and
gold
trapping
upon
a
dais
sheltered
by
striped
canvas
in
the
booths
at
each
side
the
members
of
the
court
took
their
places
while
comely
pages
ran
hither
and
thither
bearing
the
royal
commands
twas
a
lordly
sight
i
ween
this
shifting
of
proud
courtiers
flashing
of
jeweled
fans
and
commingling
of
bright
colors
with
costly
gems
now
the
herald
arose
to
command
peace
and
soon
the
clear
note
of
his
bugle
rose
above
the
roar
of
the
crowd
and
hushed
it
to
silence
the
tenscore
archers
ranged
themselves
in
two
long
rows
on
each
side
of
the
lists
a
gallant
array
while
their
captains
as
a
special
mark
of
favor
stood
near
the
royal
box
come
hither
tepus
said
the
king
to
his
come
measure
me
out
this
line
how
long
our
mark
must

is
the
reward
then
asked
the
queen
that
will
the
herald
presently
proclaim
answered
the
king
for
first
prize
we
have
offered
a
purse
containing
twoscore
golden
pounds
for

a
purse
containing

of
english

and

five
of
the

a
princely
wager
added
king
harry
laughingly
up
spake
bold
clifton
secure
in
the
king
s
favor
measure
no
marks
for
us
most
sovereign
liege
quoth
he
for
such
largess
as
that
we
ll
shoot
at
the
sun
and
the
twill
not
be
so
far
as
that
said
the
king
but
get
a
line
of
good
length
tepus
and
set
up
the
targets
at
tenscore
forthwith
tepus
bowed
low
and
set
up
ten
targets
each
bearing
the
pennant
of
a
different
company
while
the
herald
stood
forth
again
and
proclaimed
the
rules
and
prizes
the
entries
were
open
to
all
comers
each
man
also
of
the
king
s
archers
should
shoot
three
arrows
at
the
target
bearing
the
colors
of
his
band
until
the
best
bowman
in
each
band
should
be
chosen
these
ten
chosen
archers
should
then
enter
a
contest
for
an
open
target
three
shots
apiece
and
here
any
other
bowman
whatsoever
was
asked
to
try
his
skill
the
result
at
the
open
targets
should
decide
the
tourney
then
all
the
people
shouted
again
in
token
that
the
terms
of
the
contest
pleased
them
and
the
archers
waved
their
bows
aloft
and
wheeled
into
position
facing
their
respective
targets
the
shooting
now
began
upon
all
the
targets
at
once
and
the
multitude
had
so
much
ado
to
watch
them
that
they
forgot
to
shout
besides
silence
was
commanded
during
the
shooting
of
all
the
fine
shooting
that
morning
i
have
not
now
space
to
tell
you
the
full
score
of
men
shot
three
times
at
each
target
and
then
three
times
again
to
decide
a
tie
for
more
than
once
the
arrow
shot
by
one
man
would
be
split
wide
open
by
his
successor
every
man
s
shaft
bore
his
number
to
ease
the
counting
and
so
close
would
they
stick
at
the
end
of
a
round
that
the
target
looked
like
a
big
bristle
hairbrush
then
must
the
spectators
relieve
their
tense
spirits
by
great
cheering
while
the
king
looked
mighty
proud
of
his
skilled
bowmen
at
last
the
company
targets
were
decided
and
tepus
as
was
expected
led
the
score
having
made
six
exact
centers
in
succession
gilbert
of
the
white
hand
followed
with
five
and
clifton
with
four
two
other
captains
had
touched
their
center
four
times
but
not
roundly
while
in
the
other
companies
it
so
chanced
that
the
captains
had
been
by
some
of
the
men
under
them
the
winners
then
saluted
the
king
and
queen
and
withdrew
for
a
space
to
rest
and
renew
their
for
the
keenest
contest
of
all
while
the
lists
were
cleared
and
a
new
target
the
open
one
was
set
up
at
twelvescore
paces
at
the
bidding
of
the
king
the
herald
announced
that
the
open
target
was
to
be
shot
at
to
decide
the
title
of
the
best
archer
in
all
england
and
any
man
there
present
was
privileged
to
try
for
it
but
so
keen
had
been
the
previous
shooting
that
many
yeomen
who
had
come
to
enter
the
lists
now
would
not
do
so
and
only
a
dozen
men
stepped
forth
to
give
in
their
names
by
my
halidom
said
the
king
these
must
be
hardy
men
to
pit
themselves
against
my
archers
think
you
that
your
ten
chosen
fellows
are
the
best
bowmen
in
all
england
asked
the
queen
aye
and
in
all
the
world
beside
answered
the
king
and
thereunto
i
would
stake
five
hundred
i
am
minded
to
take
your
wager
said
the
queen
musingly
and
will
e
en
do
so
if
you
grant
me
a
what
is
it
asked
the
king
if
i
produce
five
archers
who
can
your
ten
will
you
grant
my
men
full
grace
and
amnesty
assuredly
quoth
the
king
in
right
good
humor
nathless
i
tell
you
now
your
wager
is
in
jeopardy
for
there
never
were
such
bowmen
as
tepus
and
clifton
and
gilbert
hum
said
the
queen
puckering
her
brow
still
as
though
lost
in
thought
i
must
see
if
there
be
none
present
to
aid
me
in
my
wager
boy
call
hither
sir
richard
of
the
lea
and
my
lord
bishop
of
hereford
the
two
summoned
ones
who
had
been
witnessing
the
sport
came
forward
sir
richard
said
she
thou
art
a
full
knight
and
good
would
st
advise
me
to
meet
a
wager
of
the
king
s
that
i
can
produce
other
archers
as
good
as
tepus
and
gilbert
and
clifton
nay
your
majesty
he
said
bending
his
knee
there
be
none
present
that
can
match
them
howbeit
he
added
dropping
his
voice
i
have
heard
of
some
who
lie
hid
in
sherwood
forest
who
could
show
them
strange
the
queen
smiled
and
dismissed
him
come
hither
my
lord
bishop
of
hereford
quoth
she
would
st
thou
advance
a
sum
to
support
my
wager
gainst
the
king
nay
your
majesty
said
the
fat
bishop
an
you
pardon
me
i
d
not
lay
down
a
penny
on
such
a
bet
for
by
my
silver
mitre
the
king
s
archers
are
men
who
have
no
but
suppose
i
found
men
whom
to
be
masters
at
the
bow
she
insisted
roguishly
would
st
thou
not
back
them
belike
i
have
heard
that
there
be
men
round
about
nottingham
and
plympton
who
carry
such
matters
with
a
high
hand
the
bishop
glanced
nervously
around
as
if
half
expecting
to
see
robin
hood
s
men
standing
near
then
turned
to
find
the
queen
looking
at
him
with
much
amusement
lurking
in
her
eyes
odds
bodikins
the
story
of
my
misadventure
must
have
preceded
me
he
thought
ruefully
aloud
he
said
resolved
to
face
it
out
your
majesty
such
tales
are
idle
and
exaggerated
an
you
pardon
me
i
would
add
to
the
king
s
wager
that
his
men
are
as
it
pleases
thee
replied
the
queen
imperturbably
how
much
here
is
my
purse
said
the
bishop
uneasily
it
contains
fifteen
score
nobles
or
near
a
hundred
i
ll
take
it
at
even
money
she
said
dismissing
him
and
your
majesty
turning
to
the
king
who
had
been
conversing
with
the
two
princes
and
certain
of
the
nobles
i
accept
your
wager
of
five
hundred
very
good
said
the
king
laughing
as
though
it
were
a
great
jest
but
what
had
minded
you
to
take
such
interest
in
the
sport
of
a
sudden
it
is
as
i
have
said
i
have
found
five
men
whom
i
will
pit
against
any
you
may
then
we
will
try
their
skill
speedily
quoth
the
king
how
say
you
if
first
we
decide
this
open
target
and
then
match
the
five
best
thereat
against
your
unknown
champions
agreed
said
the
queen
thereupon
she
signed
to
maid
marian
to
step
forward
from
a
booth
where
she
sat
with
other
and
whispered
something
in
her
ear
marian
courtesied
and
withdrew
now
the
ten
chosen
archers
from
the
king
s
bands
came
forth
again
and
took
their
stand
and
with
them
stood
forth
the
twelve
untried
men
from
the
open
lists
again
the
crowd
was
stilled
and
every
eye
hung
upon
the
speeding
of
the
shafts
slowly
but
skilfully
each
man
shot
and
as
his
shaft
struck
within
the
inner
ring
a
deep
breath
broke
from
the
multitude
like
the
sound
of
the
wind
upon
the
seashore
and
now
gilbert
of
the
white
hand
led
the
shooting
and
twas
only
by
the
space
of
a
hairsbreadth
upon
the
line
that
tepus
tied
his
score
stout
elwyn
the
welshman
took
third
place
one
of
the
private
archers
named
geoffrey
come
fourth
while
clifton
must
needs
content
himself
with
fifth
the
men
from
the
open
lists
shot
fairly
true
but
nervousness
and
fear
of
ridicule
wrought
their
undoing
the
herald
then
came
forward
again
and
instead
of
announcing
the
proclaimed
that
there
was
to
be
a
final
contest
two
men
had
tied
for
first
place
declared
his
majesty
the
king
and
three
others
were
entitled
to
honors
now
all
these
five
were
to
shoot
again
and
they
were
to
be
pitted
against
five
other
of
the
queen
s
choosing
men
who
had
not
yet
shot
upon
that
day
a
thrill
of
astonishment
and
excitement
swept
around
the
arena
who
were
these
men
of
the
queen
s
choosing
was
upon
every
lip
the
hubbub
of
eager
voices
grew
intense
and
in
the
midst
of
it
all
the
gate
at
the
far
end
of
the
field
opened
and
five
men
entered
and
escorted
a
lady
upon
horseback
across
the
arena
to
the
royal
box
the
lady
was
instantly
recognized
as
mistress
marian
of
the
queen
s
household
but
no
one
seemed
to
know
the
faces
of
her
escort
four
were
clad
in
lincoln
green
while
the
fifth
who
seemed
to
be
the
leader
was
dressed
in
a
brave
suit
of
scarlet
red
each
man
wore
a
close
fitting
cap
of
black
decked
with
a
curling
white
feather
for
arms
they
carried
simply
a
stout
bow
a
sheaf
of
new
arrows
and
a
short
when
the
little
party
came
before
the
dais
on
which
the
king
and
queen
sat
the
yeomen
doffed
their
caps
humbly
while
maid
marian
was
assisted
to
dismount
your
gracious
majesty
she
said
addressing
the
queen
these
be
the
men
for
whom
you
sent
me
and
who
are
now
come
to
wear
your
colors
and
service
you
in
the
the
queen
leaned
forward
and
handed
them
each
a
scarf
of
green
and
gold
lockesley
she
said
in
a
clear
voice
i
thank
thee
and
thy
men
for
this
service
know
that
i
have
laid
a
wager
with
the
king
that
ye
can
outshoot
the
best
five
whom
he
has
found
in
all
his
the
five
men
pressed
the
scarfs
to
their
lips
in
token
of
fealty
the
king
turned
to
the
queen
inquiringly
who
are
these
men
you
have
brought
before
us
asked
he
up
came
the
worthy
bishop
of
hereford
growing
red
and
pale
by
turns
your
pardon
my
liege
lord
cried
he
but
i
must
denounce
these
fellows
as
outlaws
yon
man
in
scarlet
is
none
other
than
robin
hood
himself
the
others
are
little
john
and
will
stutely
and
will
scarlet
and
all
famous
in
the
north
countree
for
their
deeds
of
as
my
lord
bishop
personally
knows
added
the
queen
significantly
the
king
s
brows
grew
dark
the
name
of
robin
hood
was
well
known
to
him
as
to
every
man
there
present
is
this
true
he
demanded
sternly
aye
my
lord
responded
the
queen
demurely
but
bethink
you
i
have
your
royal
promise
of
grace
and
that
will
i
keep
said
the
king
holding
in
check
his
ire
by
a
mighty
effort
but
look
you
only
forty
days
do
i
grant
of
respite
when
this
time
has
elapsed
let
these
bold
outlaws
look
to
their
safety
then
turning
to
his
five
victorious
archers
who
had
drawn
near
he
added
ye
have
heard
my
men
how
that
i
have
a
wager
with
the
queen
upon
your
prowess
now
here
be
men
of
her
choosing
certain
free
shafts
of
sherwood
and
barnesdale
wherefore
look
well
to
it
gilbert
and
tepus
and
geoffrey
and
elwyn
and
clifton
if
ye
outshoot
these
knaves
i
will
fill
your
caps
with
silver
pennies
aye
and
knight
the
man
who
stands
first
but
if
ye
lose
i
give
the
prizes
for
which
ye
have
just
striven
to
robin
hood
and
his
men
according
to
my
royal
robin
hood
and
his
men
the
saying
flew
round
the
arena
with
the
speed
of
and
every
neck
craned
forward
to
see
the
famous
fellows
who
had
dared
to
brave
the
king
s
anger
because
of
the
queen
another
target
was
now
set
up
at
the
same
distance
as
the
last
and
it
was
decided
that
the
ten
archers
should
shoot
three
arrows
in
turn
gilbert
and
robin
tossed
up
a
penny
for
the
lead
and
it
fell
to
the
king
s
men
so
clifton
was
bidden
to
shoot
first
forth
he
stood
planting
his
feet
firmly
and
wetting
his
fingers
before
plucking
the
string
for
he
was
resolved
to
better
his
losing
score
of
that
day
and
in
truth
he
did
so
for
the
shaft
he
loosed
sped
true
and
landed
on
the
black
bull
though
not
in
the
exact
center
again
he
shot
and
again
he
hit
the
black
on
the
opposite
rim
the
third
shaft
swerved
downward
and
came
within
the
second
ring
some
two
fingers
breadths
away
nathless
a
general
cry
went
up
as
this
was
the
best
shooting
clifton
had
done
that
day
will
scarlet
was
chosen
to
follow
him
and
now
took
his
place
and
carefully
chose
three
round
and
arrows
careful
my
sweet
coz
quoth
robin
in
a
low
tone
the
knave
has
left
wide
space
at
the
center
for
all
of
your
but
robin
gave
will
the
wrong
caution
for
care
spoiled
his
aim
his
first
shaft
flew
wide
and
lodged
in
the
second
ring
even
further
away
than
the
worst
shot
of
clifton
your
pardon
coz
quoth
robin
hastily
bid
care
go
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
and
do
you
loose
your
string
before
it
sticks
to
your
fingers
and
will
profited
by
this
hint
and
loosed
his
next
two
shafts
as
freely
as
though
they
flew
along
a
sherwood
glade
each
struck
upon
the
bull
and
one
even
nearer
the
center
than
his
rival
s
mark
yet
the
total
score
was
adjudged
in
favor
of
clifton
at
this
will
scarlet
bit
his
lip
but
said
no
word
while
the
crowd
shouted
and
waved
yellow
flags
for
very
joy
that
the
king
s
man
had
overcome
the
outlaw
they
knew
also
that
this
demonstration
would
please
the
king
the
target
was
now
cleared
for
the
next
two
contestants
geoffrey
and
whereat
it
was
noticed
that
many
ladies
in
the
queen
s
booths
boldly
flaunted
allan
s
colors
much
to
the
honest
pride
which
glowed
in
the
cheeks
of
one
who
sat
in
their
midst
in
good
truth
said
more
than
one
lady
to
mistress
dale
if
thy
husband
can
handle
the
longbow
as
skilfully
as
the
harp
his
rival
has
little
show
of
winning
the
saying
augured
well
geoffrey
had
shot
many
good
shafts
that
day
and
indeed
had
risen
from
the
ranks
by
virtue
of
them
but
now
each
of
his
three
shots
though
well
placed
in
triangular
fashion
around
the
rim
of
the
bull
yet
allowed
an
easy
space
for
allan
to
graze
within
his
shooting
moreover
was
so
prettily
done
that
he
was
right
heartily
applauded
the
ladies
and
their
gallants
leading
in
the
now
you
must
know
that
there
had
long
been
a
friendly
rivalry
in
robin
hood
s
band
as
to
who
was
the
best
shot
next
after
robin
himself
he
and
will
stutely
had
lately
decided
their
marksmanship
and
will
had
found
that
robin
s
skill
was
now
so
great
as
to
place
the
leader
at
the
head
of
all
good
bowmen
in
the
forest
but
the
second
place
lay
between
little
john
and
stutely
and
neither
wished
to
yield
to
the
other
so
they
looked
narrowly
at
their
leader
to
see
who
should
shoot
third
robin
read
their
faces
at
a
glance
and
laughing
merrily
broke
off
two
straws
and
held
them
out
the
long
straw
goes
next
he
decided
and
it
fell
to
stutely
elwyn
the
welshman
was
to
precede
him
and
his
score
was
no
whit
better
than
geoffrey
s
but
stutely
failed
to
profit
by
it
his
besetting
sin
at
archery
had
ever
been
an
undue
haste
and
carelessness
these
were
increased
by
a
certain
moodiness
that
little
john
had
outranked
him
so
his
first
two
shafts
flew
swiftly
one
after
the
other
to
lodging
places
outside
the
welshman
s
mark
man
man
cried
robin
entreatingly
you
do
forget
the
honor
of
the
queen
and
the
credit
of
sherwood
i
ask
your
pardon
master
quoth
will
humbly
enough
and
loosing
as
he
spoke
his
last
shaft
it
whistled
down
the
course
unerringly
and
struck
in
the
exact
center
the
best
shot
yet
made
now
some
shouted
for
stutely
and
some
shouted
for
elwyn
but
elwyn
s
total
mark
was
declared
the
better
whereupon
the
king
turned
to
the
queen
what
say
you
now
quoth
he
in
some
triumph
two
out
of
the
three
first
rounds
have
gone
to
my
men
your
outlaws
will
have
to
shoot
better
than
that
in
order
to
save
your
wager
the
queen
smiled
gently
yea
my
lord
she
said
but
the
twain
who
are
left
are
able
to
do
the
shooting
you
forget
that
i
still
have
little
john
and
robin
and
you
forget
my
lady
that
i
still
have
tepus
and
so
each
turned
again
to
the
lists
and
awaited
the
next
rounds
in
silent
eagerness
i
ween
that
king
harry
had
never
watched
the
invasion
of
an
enemy
with
more
anxiety
than
he
now
felt
tepus
was
chosen
to
go
next
and
he
fell
into
the
same
error
with
will
scarlet
he
held
the
string
a
moment
too
long
and
both
his
first
and
second
arrows
came
to
grief
one
of
them
however
came
within
the
black
rim
and
he
followed
it
up
by
placing
his
third
in
the
full
center
just
as
stutely
had
done
in
his
last
these
two
centers
were
the
fairest
shots
that
had
been
made
that
day
and
loud
was
the
applause
which
greeted
this
second
one
but
the
shouting
was
as
nothing
to
the
uproar
which
followed
little
john
s
shooting
that
giant
seemed
determined
to
outdo
tepus
by
a
tiny
margin
in
each
separate
shot
for
the
first
and
the
second
shafts
grazed
his
rival
s
on
the
inner
side
while
for
the
third
little
john
did
the
old
trick
of
the
forest
he
shot
his
own
arrow
in
a
graceful
curve
which
descended
from
above
upon
tepus
s
final
center
shaft
with
a
glancing
blow
that
drove
the
other
out
and
left
the
outlaw
s
in
its
place
the
king
could
scarce
believe
his
eyes
by
my
halidom
quoth
he
that
fellow
deserves
either
a
dukedom
or
a
hanging
he
must
be
in
league
with
satan
himself
never
saw
i
such
the
score
is
tied
my
lord
said
the
queen
we
have
still
to
see
gilbert
and
robin
gilbert
now
took
his
stand
and
slowly
shot
his
arrows
one
after
another
into
the
bull
twas
the
best
shooting
he
had
yet
done
but
there
was
still
the
smallest
of
spaces
left
if
you
looked
closely
at
the
very
center
well
done
gilbert
spoke
up
robin
hood
you
are
a
foeman
worthy
of
being
shot
he
took
his
own
place
as
he
spoke
now
if
you
had
placed
one
of
your
shafts
loosing
one
of
his
own
and
another
out
sped
the
second
and
another
the
third
was
launched
mayhap
the
king
would
have
declared
you
the
best
bowman
in
all
england
but
the
last
part
of
his
merry
speech
was
drowned
in
the
wild
tumult
of
applause
which
followed
his
exploit
his
first
two
shafts
had
packed
themselves
into
the
small
space
left
at
the
bull
while
his
third
had
split
down
between
them
taking
half
of
each
and
making
all
three
appear
from
a
distance
as
one
immense
arrow
up
rose
the
king
in
amazement
and
anger
gilbert
is
not
yet
beaten
he
cried
did
he
not
shoot
within
the
mark
thrice
and
that
is
allowed
a
best
in
all
the
rules
of
robin
bowed
low
as
it
please
your
majesty
quoth
he
but
may
i
be
allowed
to
place
the
mark
for
the
second
shooting
the
king
waved
his
hand
thereupon
robin
prepared
another
old
trick
of
the
greenwood
and
got
him
a
light
peeled
willow
wand
which
he
set
in
the
ground
in
place
of
the
target
there
friend
gilbert
called
he
gaily
belike
you
can
hit
that
i
can
scarce
see
it
from
here
said
gilbert
much
less
hit
it
nathless
for
the
king
s
honor
i
will
but
this
final
shot
proved
his
undoing
and
his
shaft
flew
harmlessly
by
the
thin
white
streak
then
came
robin
to
his
stand
again
and
picked
his
arrow
with
exceeding
care
and
tried
his
string
amid
a
breathless
pause
he
drew
the
good
yew
bow
back
to
his
ear
glanced
along
the
shaft
and
let
the
feathered
missile
fly
straight
it
sped
singing
a
keen
note
of
triumph
as
it
went
the
willow
wand
was
split
in
twain
as
though
it
had
met
a
hunter
s
knife
verily
i
think
your
bow
is
armed
with
witchcraft
cried
gilbert
for
i
did
not
believe
such
shooting
you
should
come
to
see
our
merry
lads
in
the
greenwood
retorted
robin
lightly
for
willow
wands
do
not
grow
upon
the
cobblestones
of
london
meanwhile
the
king
in
great
wrath
had
risen
to
depart
first
signing
the
judges
to
distribute
the
prizes
never
a
word
said
he
of
good
or
ill
to
the
queen
but
mounted
his
horse
and
followed
by
his
sons
and
knights
rode
off
the
field
the
archers
dropped
upon
one
knee
as
he
passed
but
he
gave
them
a
single
baleful
look
and
was
gone
then
the
queen
beckoned
the
outlaws
to
approach
and
they
did
so
and
knelt
at
her
feet
right
well
have
ye
served
me
she
said
and
sorry
am
i
that
the
king
s
anger
is
aroused
thereby
but
fear
ye
not
his
word
and
grace
hold
true
as
to
these
prizes
ye
have
gained
i
add
others
of
mine
own
the
wagers
i
have
won
from
his
majesty
the
king
and
from
the
lord
bishop
of
hereford
buy
with
some
of
these
moneys
the
best
swords
ye
can
find
in
london
for
all
your
band
and
call
them
the
swords
of
the
queen
and
swear
with
them
to
protect
all
the
poor
and
the
helpless
and
the
women
kind
who
come
your
we
swear
said
the
five
yeomen
solemnly
then
the
queen
gave
each
of
them
her
hand
to
kiss
and
arose
and
departed
with
all
her
ladies
and
after
they
were
gone
the
king
s
archers
came
crowding
around
robin
and
his
men
eager
to
get
a
glimpse
of
the
fellows
about
whom
they
had
heard
so
much
and
back
of
them
came
a
great
crowd
of
the
spectators
pushing
and
jostling
in
their
efforts
to
come
nearer
verily
laughed
little
john
they
must
take
us
for
a
merry
andrew
show
now
the
judges
came
up
and
announced
each
man
his
prize
according
to
the
king
s
command
to
robin
was
give
the
purse
containing
twoscore
golden
pounds
to
little
john
the
twoscore
silver
pennies
and
to
the
fine
inlaid
bugle
much
to
his
delight
for
he
was
skilled
at
blowing
sweet
tunes
upon
the
horn
hardly
less
than
handling
the
harp
strings
but
when
the
rhenish
wine
and
english
beer
and
harts
of
dallom
lea
were
spoken
of
robin
said
nay
what
need
we
of
wine
or
beer
so
far
from
the
greenwood
and
twould
be
like
carrying
coals
to
newcastle
to
drive
those
harts
to
sherwood
now
gilbert
and
tepus
and
their
men
have
shot
passing
well
wherefore
the
meat
and
drink
must
go
to
them
an
they
will
accept
it
of
right
gladly
replied
gilbert
grasping
his
hand
ye
are
good
men
all
and
we
will
toast
you
every
one
in
memory
of
the
greatest
day
at
archery
that
england
has
ever
seen
or
ever
will
see
thus
said
all
the
king
s
archers
and
the
hand
of
was
given
amid
much
shouting
and
clapping
on
the
and
so
ended
king
harry
s
tourney
whose
story
has
been
handed
down
from
sire
to
son
even
unto
the
present
day
chapter
xiv
how
robin
hood
was
sought
of
the
tinker
and
while
the
tinker
fell
asleep
robin
made
haste
away
and
left
the
tinker
in
the
lurch
for
the
great
shot
to
pay
king
henry
was
as
good
as
his
word
robin
hood
and
his
party
were
suffered
to
depart
from
london
the
parting
bringing
keen
sorrow
to
marian
and
for
forty
days
no
hand
was
raised
against
them
but
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
royal
word
was
sent
to
the
worthy
sheriff
at
nottingham
that
he
must
lay
hold
upon
the
outlaws
without
further
delay
as
he
valued
his
office
indeed
the
exploits
of
robin
and
his
band
ending
with
the
great
tourney
in
finsbury
field
had
made
a
mighty
stir
through
all
england
and
many
there
were
to
laugh
boldly
at
the
nottingham
official
for
his
failures
to
capture
the
outlaws
the
sheriff
thereupon
planned
three
new
expeditions
into
the
greenwood
and
was
even
brave
enough
to
lead
them
since
he
had
men
at
his
beck
and
call
each
time
but
never
the
shadow
of
an
outlaw
did
he
see
for
robin
s
men
lay
close
and
the
sheriff
s
men
knew
not
how
to
come
at
their
chief
in
the
cove
before
the
cavern
now
the
sheriff
s
daughter
had
hated
robin
hood
bitterly
in
her
heart
ever
since
the
day
he
refused
to
bestow
upon
her
the
golden
arrow
and
shamed
her
before
all
the
company
his
tricks
also
upon
her
father
were
not
calculated
to
lessen
her
hatred
and
so
she
sought
about
for
means
to
aid
the
sheriff
in
catching
the
enemy
there
is
no
need
to
go
against
this
man
with
force
of
arms
she
said
we
must
meet
his
tricks
with
other
tricks
of
our
would
that
we
could
groaned
the
sheriff
the
fellow
is
becoming
a
nightmare
unto
let
me
plan
a
while
she
replied
belike
i
can
cook
up
some
scheme
for
his
agreed
said
the
sheriff
and
if
anything
comes
of
your
planning
i
will
e
en
give
you
an
hundred
silver
pennies
for
a
new
gown
and
a
double
reward
to
the
man
who
catches
the
now
upon
that
same
day
while
the
sheriff
s
daughter
was
racking
her
brains
for
a
scheme
there
came
to
the
mansion
house
a
strolling
tinker
named
middle
a
great
gossip
and
braggart
and
as
he
pounded
away
upon
some
pots
and
pans
in
the
scullery
he
talked
loudly
about
what
would
do
if
he
once
came
within
reach
of
that
rascal
robin
hood
it
might
be
that
this
simple
fellow
could
do
something
through
his
very
simplicity
mused
the
sheriff
s
daughter
overhearing
his
prattle
odds
bodikins
twill
do
no
harm
to
try
his
service
while
i
bethink
myself
of
some
better
and
she
called
him
to
her
and
looked
him
over
a
big
brawny
fellow
enough
with
an
honest
look
about
the
eye
and
a
countenance
so
open
that
when
he
smiled
his
mouth
seemed
the
only
country
on
the
map
i
am
minded
to
try
your
skill
at
outlaw
catching
she
said
and
will
add
goodly
measure
to
the
stated
reward
if
you
succeed
do
you
wish
to
make
good
your
boasted
prowess
the
tinker
grinned
broadly
yes
your
ladyship
he
said
then
here
is
a
warrant
made
out
this
morning
by
the
sheriff
himself
see
that
you
keep
it
safely
and
use
it
to
good
and
she
dismissed
him
middle
departed
from
the
house
mightily
pleased
with
himself
and
proud
of
his
commission
he
swung
his
recklessly
in
his
glee
so
recklessly
that
he
imperiled
the
shins
of
more
than
one
angry
and
vowed
he
d
crack
the
ribs
of
robin
hood
with
it
though
he
was
surrounded
by
every
outlaw
in
the
whole
greenwood
spurred
on
by
the
thoughts
of
his
own
coming
bravery
he
left
the
town
and
proceeded
toward
barnesdale
the
day
was
hot
and
dusty
and
at
noontime
he
paused
at
a
wayside
inn
to
refresh
himself
he
began
by
eating
and
drinking
and
dozing
in
turn
then
sought
to
do
all
at
once
mine
host
of
the
seven
does
stood
by
discussing
the
eternal
robin
with
a
drover
folk
do
say
that
my
lord
sheriff
has
sent
into
lincoln
for
more
and
horses
and
that
when
he
has
these
behind
him
he
ll
soon
rid
the
forest
of
these
of
whom
speak
you
asked
the
tinker
sitting
up
of
robin
hood
and
his
men
said
the
host
but
go
to
sleep
again
you
will
never
get
the
reward
and
why
not
asked
the
tinker
rising
with
great
show
of
dignity
where
our
sheriff
has
failed
and
the
stout
guy
of
gisborne
and
many
more
beside
it
behoves
not
a
mere
tinker
to
the
tinker
laid
a
heavy
hand
upon
the
innkeeper
s
fat
shoulder
and
tried
to
look
impressive
there
is
your
reckoning
host
upon
the
table
i
must
e
en
go
upon
my
way
because
i
have
more
important
business
than
to
stand
here
gossiping
with
you
but
be
not
surprised
if
the
next
time
you
see
me
i
shall
have
with
me
no
less
person
than
robin
hood
himself
and
he
strode
loftily
out
the
door
and
walked
up
the
hot
white
road
toward
barnesdale
he
had
not
gone
above
a
quarter
of
a
mile
when
he
met
a
young
man
with
curling
brown
hair
and
merry
eyes
the
young
man
carried
his
light
cloak
over
his
arm
because
of
the
heat
and
was
unarmed
save
for
a
light
sword
at
his
side
the
newcomer
eyed
the
perspiring
tinker
in
a
friendly
way
and
seeing
he
was
a
stout
fellow
accosted
him
to
you
said
he
to
you
said
the
tinker
and
a
morrow
less
aye
laughed
the
other
whence
come
you
and
know
you
the
news
what
is
the
news
said
the
gossipy
tinker
pricking
up
his
ear
i
am
a
tinker
by
trade
middle
by
name
and
come
from
over
against
why
as
for
the
news
laughed
the
stranger
i
hear
that
two
tinkers
were
set
i
the
stocks
for
drinking
too
much
ale
and
if
that
be
all
your
news
retorted
middle
i
can
beat
you
clear
to
the
end
of
the
what
news
have
you
seeing
that
you
go
from
town
to
town
i
ween
you
can
outdo
a
poor
country
yokel
at
all
i
have
to
tell
said
the
other
is
that
i
am
especially
commissioned
he
felt
mightily
proud
of
these
big
words
especially
commissioned
to
seek
a
bold
outlaw
which
they
call
robin
so
said
the
other
arching
his
brows
how
especially
commissioned
i
have
a
warrant
from
the
sheriff
sealed
with
the
king
s
own
seal
to
take
him
where
i
can
and
if
you
can
tell
me
where
he
is
i
will
e
en
make
a
man
of
let
me
see
the
warrant
said
the
other
to
satisfy
myself
if
it
be
right
and
i
will
do
the
best
i
can
to
bring
him
to
that
will
i
not
replied
the
tinker
i
will
trust
none
with
it
and
if
you
ll
not
help
me
to
come
at
him
i
must
forsooth
catch
him
by
and
he
made
his
whistle
shrill
circles
in
the
air
the
other
smiled
at
the
tinker
s
simplicity
and
said
the
middle
of
the
road
on
a
hot
july
day
is
not
a
good
place
to
talk
things
over
now
if
you
re
the
man
for
me
and
i
m
the
man
for
you
let
s
go
back
to
the
inn
just
beyond
the
bend
of
road
and
quench
our
thirst
and
cool
our
heads
for
marry
come
up
quoth
the
tinker
that
will
i
for
though
i
ve
just
come
from
there
my
thirst
rises
mightily
at
the
sound
of
your
so
back
he
turned
with
the
stranger
and
proceeded
to
the
seven
the
landlord
arched
his
eyebrows
silently
when
he
saw
the
two
come
in
but
served
them
willingly
the
tinker
asked
for
wine
and
robin
for
ale
the
wine
was
not
the
most
cooling
drink
in
the
cellar
nor
the
clearest
headed
nathless
the
tinker
asked
for
it
since
it
was
expensive
and
the
other
man
had
invited
him
to
drink
they
lingered
long
over
their
cups
master
middle
emptying
one
after
another
while
the
stranger
expounded
at
great
length
on
the
best
plans
for
coming
at
and
capturing
robin
hood
in
the
end
the
tinker
fell
sound
asleep
while
in
the
act
of
trying
to
get
a
tankard
to
his
lips
then
the
stranger
deftly
opened
the
snoring
man
s
pouch
took
out
the
warrant
read
it
and
put
it
in
his
own
wallet
calling
mine
host
to
him
he
winked
at
him
with
a
half
smile
and
told
him
that
the
tinker
would
pay
the
whole
score
when
he
awoke
thus
was
master
middle
left
in
the
lurch
for
the
great
shot
to
nathless
the
stranger
seemed
in
no
great
hurry
he
had
the
whim
to
stay
awhile
and
see
what
the
droll
tinker
might
do
when
he
awoke
so
he
hid
behind
a
window
shutter
on
the
outside
and
awaited
events
presently
the
tinker
came
to
himself
with
a
prodigious
yawn
and
reached
at
once
for
another
drink
what
were
you
saying
friend
about
the
best
plan
for
catching

fellow

the

and
i
marvel
greatly
to
hear
you
speak
in
such
fashion
of
your
friend
robin
hood
of
barnesdale
for
was
he
not
with
you
in
all
robin
hood
gasped
middle
with
staring
eyes
why
did
you
not
tell
me
faith
saw
no
need
o
telling
you
did
you
not
tell
me
the
first
time
you
were
here
that
i
need
not
be
surprised
if
you
came
back
with
no
less
person
than
robin
hood
himself
jesu
give
me
pardon
moaned
the
tinker
i
see
it
all
now
he
got
me
to
drinking
and
then
took
my
warrant
and
my
pennies
and
my
crust
yes

interrupted
the
host
i
know
all
about
that
but
pay
me
the
score
for
both
of
but
i
have
no
money
gossip
let
me
go
after
that
vile
and
i
ll
soon
get
it
out
of
not
so
replied
the
other
if
i
waited
for
you
to
collect
from
robin
hood
i
would
soon
close
up
what
is
the
account
asked
middle
ten
shillings
then
take
here
my
and
my
good
hammer
too
and
if
i
light
upon
that
knave
i
will
soon
come
back
after
give
me
your
leathern
coat
as
well
said
mine
host
the
hammer
and
bag
of
tools
are
as
naught
to
gramercy
cried
master
middle
losing
what
was
left
of
his
temper
it
seems
that
i
have
escaped
one
thief
only
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
another
if
you
will
but
walk
with
me
out
into
the
middle
of
the
road
i
ll
give
you
such
a
crack
as
shall
drive
some
honesty
into
your
thick
you
are
wasting
your
breath
and
my
time
retorted
the
landlord
give
me
your
things
and
get
you
gone
after
your
man
middle
thought
this
to
be
good
advice
so
he
strode
forth
from
the
seven
does
in
a
black
mood
ere
he
had
gone
half
a
mile
he
saw
robin
hood
walking
demurely
among
the
trees
a
little
in
front
of
him
ho
there
you
villain
roared
the
tinker
stay
your
steps
i
am
desperately
in
need
of
you
this
day
robin
turned
about
with
a
surprised
face
what
knave
is
this
he
asked
gently
who
comes
shouting
after
me
no
knave
no
knave
at
all
panted
the
other
rushing
up
but
an
honest
man
who
would
have
that
warrant
and
the
money
for
drink
why
as
i
live
it
is
our
honest
tinker
who
was
seeking
robin
hood
did
you
find
him
gossip
marry
that
did
i
and
i
m
now
going
to
pay
him
my
respects
and
he
plunged
at
him
making
a
sweeping
stroke
with
his
robin
tried
to
draw
his
sword
but
could
not
do
it
for
a
moment
through
dodging
the
other
s
furious
blows
when
he
did
get
it
in
hand
the
tinker
had
reached
him
thrice
with
resounding
thwacks
then
the
tables
were
turned
for
he
dashed
in
right
manfully
with
his
shining
blade
and
made
the
tinker
give
back
again
the
greenwood
rang
with
the
noise
of
the
fray
twas
steel
against
wood
and
they
made
a
terrible
clattering
when
they
came
together
robin
thought
at
first
that
he
could
hack
the
cudgel
to
pieces
for
his
blade
was
one
of
toledo
finely
tempered
steel
which
the
queen
had
given
him
but
the
had
been
fired
and
hardened
and
seasoned
by
the
tinker
s
arts
until
it
was
like
a
bar
of
iron
no
pleasant
neighbor
for
one
s
ribs
robin
presently
found
this
out
to
his
sorrow
the
long
reach
and
long
stick
got
to
him
when
twas
impossible
for
him
to
touch
his
antagonist
so
his
sides
began
to
ache
sorely
hold
your
hand
tinker
he
said
at
length
i
cry
a
boon
of
before
i
do
it
said
the
tinker
i
d
hang
you
on
this
but
even
as
he
spoke
robin
found
the
moment
s
grace
for
which
he
longed
and
immediately
grasped
his
horn
and
blew
the
three
blasts
of
the
greenwood
a
murrain
seize
you
roared
the
tinker
commencing
afresh
up
to
your
old
tricks
again
are
you
well
i
ll
have
time
to
finish
my
job
if
i
but
robin
was
quite
able
to
hold
his
own
at
a
pinch
and
they
had
not
exchanged
many
lunges
and
passes
when
up
came
little
john
and
will
scarlet
and
a
score
of
yeomen
at
their
heels
middle
was
seized
without
ceremony
while
robin
sat
himself
down
to
breathe
what
is
the
matter
quoth
little
john
that
you
should
sit
so
weariedly
upon
the
highway
side
faith
that
rascally
tinker
yonder
has
paid
his
score
well
upon
my
hide
answered
robin
ruefully
that
tinker
then
said
little
john
must
be
itching
for
more
work
fain
would
i
try
if
he
can
do
as
much
for
or
me
said
will
scarlet
who
like
little
john
was
always
willing
to
swing
a
cudgel
nay
laughed
robin
belike
i
could
have
done
better
an
he
had
given
me
time
to
pull
a
young
tree
up
by
the
roots
but
i
hated
to
spoil
the
queen
s
blade
upon
his
tough
stick
or
no
less
tough
hide
he
had
a
warrant
for
my
arrest
which
i
stole
from
also
item
twelve
silver
pennies
interposed
the
tinker
unsubdued
item
one
crust
of
bread
gainst
my
supper
item
one
lump
of
solder
item
three
pieces
of
twine
item
six
single
keys
item
yes
i
know
quoth
the
merry
robin
i
stood
outside
the
landlord
s
window
and
heard
you
count
over
your
losses
here
they
are
again
and
the
silver
pennies
are
turned
by
magic
into
gold
here
also
if
you
will
is
my
i
take
it
heartily
with
the
pence
cried
middle
by
my
leathern
coat
and
tools
which
i
shall
presently
have
out
of
that
sly
host
i
swear
that
i
never
yet
met
a
man
i
liked
as
well
as
you
an
you
and
your
men
here
will
take
me
i
swear
i
ll
serve
you
honestly
do
you
want
a
tinker
nay
but
verily
you
must
who
else
can
mend
and
grind
your
swords
and
patch
your
pannikins
and
fight
too
when
occasion
serve
mend
your
pots
mend
your
and
he
ended
his
speech
with
the
sonorous
cry
of
his
craft
by
this
time
the
whole
band
was
laughing
uproariously
at
the
tinker
s
talk
what
say
you
fellows
asked
robin
would
not
this
tinker
be
a
good
recruit
that
he
would
answered
will
scarlet
clapping
the
new
man
on
the
back
he
will
keep
friar
tuck
and
much
the
miller
s
son
from
having
the
so
amid
great
merriment
and
right
good
fellowship
the
outlaws
shook
middle
by
the
hand
and
he
took
oath
of
fealty
and
thought
no
more
of
the
sheriff
s
daughter
chapter

how
robin
hood
was
tanned
of
the
tanner
in
nottingham
there
lived
a
jolly
tanner
with
a
hey
down
down
a
down
down
his
name
was
there
was
ne
er
a
squire
in
nottinghamshire
dare
bid
bold
arthur
stand
and
as
he
went
forth
in
a
summer
s
morning
with
a
hey
down
down
a
down
down
to
the
forest
of
merrie
sherwood
to
view
the
red
deer
that
range
here
and
there
there
met
he
with
bold
robin
hood
the
sheriff
s
daughter
bided
for
several
days
in
the
faint
hope
that
she
might
hear
tidings
of
the
prattling
tinker
but
never
a
word
heard
she
and
she
was
forced
to
the
conclusion
that
her
messenger
had
not
so
much
as
laid
eyes
upon
the
outlaw
little
recked
she
that
he
was
even
then
grinding
and
sharpening
arrows
out
in
the
good
greenwood
while
whistling
blithely
or
chatting
merrily
with
the
good
friar
tuck
then
she
bethought
herself
of
another
good
man
one
a
tanner
who
dwelt
in
nottingham
town
and
was
in
the
tourneys
round
about
he
had
done
some
pretty
tricks
at
archery
but
was
strongest
at
wrestling
and
the
for
three
years
he
had
cast
all
comers
to
the
earth
in
wrestling
until
the
famous
eric
o
lincoln
broke
a
rib
for
him
in
a
mighty
tussle
howsoever
at
he
had
never
yet
met
his
match
so
that
there
was
never
a
squire
in
nottinghamshire
dare
bid
bold
arthur
stand
with
a
long
on
his
shoulder
so
well
he
could
clear
his
way
that
by
two
and
three
he
made
men
flee
and
none
of
them
could
stay
thus
at
least
runs
the
old
song
which
tells
of
his
might
this
is
just
the
man
for
me
thought
the
sheriff
s
daughter
to
herself
and
she
forthwith
summoned
him
to
the
mansion
house
and
commissioned
him
to
seek
out
robin
hood
the
warrant
was
quite
to
arthur
s
liking
for
he
was
happiest
when
out
in
the
forest
taking
a
sly
peep
at
the
king
s
deer
and
now
he
reckoned
that
he
could
look
at
them
boldly
instead
of
by
the
rays
of
the
moon
he
could
say
to
any
king
s
forester
who
made
bold
to
stop
him
i
am
here
on
the
king
s
business
gramercy
no
more
and
and
the
smell
of
hides
quoth
he
gaily
i
shall
e
en
see
what
the
free
air
of
heaven
tastes
like
when
it
sweeps
through
the
open
so
the
tanner
departed
joyfully
upon
his
errand
but
much
more
interested
in
the
dun
deer
of
the
forest
than
in
any
rovers
therein
this
interest
had
in
fact
caused
the
foresters
to
keep
a
shrewd
eye
upon
him
in
the
past
for
his
tannery
was
apt
to
have
plenty
of
meat
in
it
that
was
more
like
venison
than
the
law
allowed
as
for
the
outlaws
arthur
bore
them
no
indeed
he
had
felt
a
secret
envy
in
his
heart
at
their
free
life
but
he
was
not
afraid
to
meet
any
two
men
who
might
come
against
him
nathless
the
sheriff
s
daughter
did
not
choose
a
very
good
messenger
as
you
shall
presently
see
away
sped
the
tanner
a
piece
of
bread
and
some
wine
in
his
wallet
a
good
longbow
and
arrows
slung
across
his
shoulder
his
stout
in
his
hand
and
on
his
head
a
cap
of
trebled
so
tough
that
it
would
turn
the
edge
of
a
broadsword
he
lost
no
time
in
getting
out
of
the
hot
sun
and
into
the
welcome
shade
of
the
forest
where
he
stalked
cautiously
about
seeking
some
sign
of
the
dun
deer
now
it
so
chanced
that
upon
that
very
morning
robin
hood
had
sent
little
john
to
a
neighboring
village
to
buy
some
cloth
of
lincoln
green
for
new
suits
for
all
the
band
some
of
the
money
recently
won
of
the
king
was
being
spent
in
this
fashion
gainst
the
approach
of
winter
will
scarlet
had
been
sent
on
a
similar
errand
to
barnesdale
some
time
before
if
you
remember
only
to
be
chased
up
the
hill
without
his
purchase
so
little
john
was
chosen
and
for
sweet
company
s
sake
robin
went
with
him
a
part
of
the
way
until
they
came
to
the
seven
does
the
inn
where
robin
had
recently
played
his
prank
upon
middle
the
tinker
here
they
drank
a
glass
of
ale
to
refresh
themselves
withal
and
for
good
luck
and
robin
tarried
a
bit
while
little
john
went
on
his
errand
presently
robin
entered
the
edge
of
the
wood
when
whom
should
he
see
but
busily
creeping
after
a
graceful
deer
that
browsed
alone
down
the
glade
now
by
saint
george
and
the
dragon
quoth
robin
to
himself
i
much
fear
that
yon
same
fellow
is
a
rascally
poacher
come
after
our
own
and
the
king
s
meat
for
you
must
know
by
a
curious
process
of
reasoning
robin
and
his
men
had
hunted
in
the
royal
preserves
so
long
that
they
had
come
to
consider
themselves
joint
owners
to
every
animal
which
roamed
therein
nay
he
added
this
must
be
looked
into
that
cap
in
sooth
must
hide
a
scurvy
varlet
and
forthwith
he
crept
behind
a
tree
and
thence
to
another
stalking
our
friend
arthur
as
busily
as
arthur
was
stalking
the
deer
this
went
on
for
quite
a
space
until
the
tanner
began
to
come
upon
the
deer
and
to
draw
his
bow
in
order
to
tickle
the
victim
s
ribs
with
a
shaft
but
just
at
this
moment
robin
unluckily
trod
upon
a
twig
which
snapped
and
caused
the
tanner
to
turn
suddenly
robin
saw
that
he
was
discovered
so
he
determined
to
put
a
bold
face
on
the
matter
and
went
forward
with
some
smart
show
of
authority
hold
he
cried
stay
your
hand
why
who
are
you
bold
fellow
to
range
so
boldly
here
in
sooth
to
be
brief
ye
look
like
a
thief
that
has
come
to
steal
the
king
s
marry
it
is
scant
concern
of
yours
what
i
look
like
retorted
who
are
you
who
speak
so
bravely
you
shall
soon
find
out
who
i
am
quoth
robin
determining
to
find
some
sport
in
the
matter
i
am
a
keeper
of
this
forest
the
king
knows
that
i
am
looking
after
his
deer
for
him
and
therefore
we
must
stay
have
you
any
assistants
friend
asked
the
tanner
calmly
for
it
is
not
one
man
alone
who
can
stop
nay
truly
gossip
replied
robin
i
have
a
good
yew
bow
also
a
right
sharp
blade
at
my
side
nathless
i
need
no
better
assistant
than
a
good
like
unto
yours
give
me
a
baker
s
dozen
of
minutes
with
it
and
it
shall
pleasure
me
to
crack
that
pate
of
yours
for
your
sauciness
softly
my
man
fair
and
softly
big
words
never
killed
so
much
as
a
mouse
least
of
all
yon
deer
which
has
got
away
while
you
were
filling
all
the
woods
with
your
noisy
breath
so
choose
your
own
playthings
for
your
sword
and
your
bow
i
care
not
a
straw
nor
for
all
your
arrows
to
boot
if
i
get
but
a
knock
at
you
twill
be
as
much
as
you
ll
now
by
our
lady
will
you
listen
to
the
braggart
cried
robin
in
a
fine
rage
marry
but
i
ll
teach
ye
to
be
more
mannerly
so
saying
he
unbuckled
his
belt
and
flinging
his
bow
upon
the
ground
he
seized
hold
of
a
young
sapling
that
was
growing
near
by
his
hunting
knife
soon
had
it
severed
and
lopped
into
shape
now
come
fellow
said
seeing
that
he
was
ready
and
if
i
do
not
tan
your
hide
for
you
in
better
shape
than
ever
was
turned
into
may
a
murrain
seize
me
stay
said
robin
methinks
my
cudgel
is
half
a
foot
longer
than
yours
i
would
have
them
of
even
length
before
you
begin
your
i
pass
not
for
length
bold
arthur
replied
my
staff
is
long
enough
as
you
will
shortly
find
out
eight
foot
and
a
half
and
twill
knock
down
a
calf
here
he
made
it
whistle
in
the
air
and
i
hope
it
will
knock
down
forthwith
the
two
men
spat
on
their
hands
laid
firm
hold
upon
their
cudgels
and
began
slowly
circling
round
each
other
looking
for
an
opening
now
it
so
chanced
that
little
john
had
fared
expeditiously
with
his
errand
he
had
met
the
merchant
from
whom
he
was
wont
to
buy
lincoln
green
coming
along
the
road
and
had
made
known
his
wants
in
few
words
the
merchant
readily
undertook
to
deliver
the
suits
by
a
certain
day
in
the
following
month
so
little
john
glad
to
get
back
to
the
cool
shelter
of
the
greenwood
hasted
along
the
road
lately
taken
by
robin
presently
he
heard
the
sound
of
angry
voices
one
of
which
he
recognized
as
his
captain
s
now
heaven
forfend
quoth
he
that
robin
hood
has
fallen
into
the
clutches
of
a
king
s
man
i
must
take
a
peep
at
this
so
he
cautiously
made
his
way
from
tree
to
tree
as
robin
had
done
till
he
came
to
the
little
open
space
where
robin
and
arthur
were
circling
about
each
other
with
angry
looks
like
two
dogs
at
bay
ha
this
looks
interesting
muttered
little
john
to
himself
for
he
loved
a
good
bout
above
anything
else
in
the
world
and
was
the
best
man
at
it
in
all
the
greenwood
and
he
crawled
quietly
underneath
a
friendly
bush
much
as
he
had
done
when
robin
undertook
to
teach
will
scarlet
a
lesson
and
chuckled
softly
to
himself
and
slapped
his
thigh
and
prepared
to
watch
the
fight
at
his
ease
indeed
it
was
both
exciting
and
laughable
you
would
have
chuckled
one
moment
and
caught
your
breath
the
next
to
see
those
two
stout
fellows
swinging
their
sticks
each
half
as
long
again
as
the
men
were
and
thick
as
their
arm
and
edging
along
sidewise
neither
wishing
to
strike
the
first
blow
at
last
robin
could
no
longer
forbear
and
his
good
right
arm
swung
round
like
a
flash
ping
went
the
stick
on
the
back
of
the
other
s
head
raising
such
a
welt
that
the
blood
came
but
the
tanner
did
not
seem
to
mind
it
at
all
for
bing
went
his
own
staff
in
return
giving
robin
as
good
as
he
had
sent
then
the
battle
was
on
and
furiously
it
waged
fast
fell
the
blows
but
few
save
the
first
ones
landed
being
met
in
by
a
till
the
thwacking
sticks
sounded
like
the
steady
roll
of
a
and
the
oak
bark
flew
as
fine
as
it
had
ever
done
in
s
tannery
round
and
round
they
fought
digging
their
heels
into
the
ground
to
keep
from
slipping
so
that
you
would
have
vowed
there
had
been
a
yoke
of
oxen
ploughing
a
round
and
round
up
and
down
in
and
out
their
arms
working
like
went
the
yeoman
and
the
tanner
for
a
full
hour
each
becoming
more
astonished
every
minute
that
the
other
was
such
a
good
fellow
while
little
john
from
underneath
his
bushy
covert
had
much
ado
to
keep
from
roaring
aloud
in
pure
joy
finally
robin
saw
his
chance
and
brought
a
full
arm
blow
straight
down
upon
the
other
s
head
with
a
force
that
would
have
felled
a
bullock
but
arthur
s
trebled
cap
here
stood
him
in
good
stead
the
blow
glanced
off
without
doing
more
than
stunning
him
nathless
he
reeled
and
had
much
ado
to
keep
from
falling
seeing
which
robin
stayed
his
hand
to
his
own
sorrow
for
the
tanner
recovered
his
wits
in
a
marvelous
quick
space
and
sent
back
a
sidelong
blow
which
fairly
lifted
robin
off
his
feet
and
sent
him
tumbling
on
to
the
grass
hold
your
hand
hold
your
hand
roared
robin
with
what
little
breath
he
had
left
hold
i
say
and
i
will
give
you
the
freedom
of
the
why
said
arthur
i
may
thank
my
staff
for
that
not
well
well
gossip
let
be
as
it
may
but
prithee
tell
me
your
name
and
trade
i
like
to
know
fellows
who
can
hit
a
blow
like
that
same
i
am
a
tanner
replied
in
nottingham
long
have
i
wrought
and
if
you
ll
come
to
me
i
swear
i
ll
tan
your
hides
for
odds
bodikins
quoth
robin
ruefully
mine
own
hide
is
tanned
enough
for
the
present
howsoever
there
be
others
in
this
wood
i
would
fain
see
you
tackle
harkee
if
you
will
leave
your
and
come
with
me
as
sure
as
my
name
is
robin
hood
you
shan
t
want
gold
or
by
the
breath
o
my
body
said
arthur
that
will
i
do
and
he
gripped
him
gladly
by
the
hand
but
i
am
minded
that
i
clean
forgot
the
errand
that
brought
me
to
sherwood
i
was
commissioned
by
some
under
the
sheriff
s
roof
to
capture
so
was
a
certain
tinker
now
in
our
service
said
robin
smilingly
verily
tis
a
new
way
to
recruit
forces
said
the
tanner
laughing
loudly
but
tell
me
good
robin
hood
where
is
little
john
i
fain
would
see
him
for
he
is
a
kinsman
on
my
mother
s
here
am
i
good
said
a
voice
and
little
john
literally
rolled
out
from
under
the
bush
to
the
sward
his
eyes
were
full
of
tears
from
much
laughter
which
had
left
him
powerless
to
get
on
his
feet
as
soon
as
the
astonished
tanner
saw
who
it
was
he
gave
little
john
a
mighty
hug
around
the
neck
and
lifted
him
up
on
his
feet
and
the
two
pounded
each
other
on
the
back
soundly
so
glad
were
they
to
meet
again
o
man
man
said
little
john
as
soon
as
he
had
got
his
breath
never
saw
i
so
fine
a
sight
in
all
my
born
days
you
did
knock
him
over
like
as
he
were
a
ninepin
and
you
do
joy
to
see
me
thwacked
about
on
the
ribs
asked
robin
with
some
choler
nay
not
that
master
said
little
john
but
tis
the
second
time
i
have
had
special
tickets
to
a
show
from
beneath
the
bushes
and
i
can
not
forbear
my
delight
howsoever
take
no
shame
unto
yourself
for
this
same
is
the
best
man
at
the
in
all
nottinghamshire
it
commonly
takes
two
or
three
men
to
hold

eric
o
lincoln
said
arthur
modestly
and
i
well
know
how
you
paid
him
out
at
the
say
no
more
said
robin
springing
to
his
feet
for
well
i
know
that
i
have
done
good
business
this
day
and
a
few
bruises

with

and
cowhides
i
ll
follow
you
two
in
the
sweet
open
air
to
the
very
ends
of
earth
chapter
xvi
how
robin
hood
met
sir
richard
of
the
lea
then
answered
him
the
gentle
knight
with
words
both
fair
and
thee
god
save
thee
my
good
robin
and
all
thy
company
now
you
must
know
that
some
months
passed
by
the
winter
dragged
its
weary
length
through
sherwood
forest
and
robin
hood
and
his
merry
men
found
what
cheer
they
could
in
the
big
crackling
fires
before
their
woodland
cave
friar
tuck
had
built
him
a
little
hermitage
not
far
away
where
he
lived
comfortably
with
his
numerous
dogs
the
winter
i
say
reached
an
end
at
last
and
the
blessed
spring
came
and
went
another
summer
passed
on
apace
and
still
neither
king
nor
sheriff
nor
bishop
could
catch
the
outlaws
who
meanwhile
thrived
and
prospered
mightily
in
their
outlawry
the
band
had
been
increased
from
time
to
time
by
picked
men
such
as
and
david
of
doncaster
he
who
was
the
jolliest
cobbler
for
miles
around
until
it
now
numbered
a
full
sevenscore
of
men
seven
companies
each
with
its
stout
lieutenant
serving
under
robin
hood
and
still
they
relieved
the
purses
of
the
rich
and
aided
the
poor
and
feasted
upon
king
s
deer
until
the
lank
sheriff
of
nottingham
was
distracted
indeed
that
official
would
probable
have
lost
his
office
entirely
had
it
not
been
for
the
fact
of
the
king
s
death
henry
passed
away
as
all
kings
will
in
common
with
ordinary
men
and
richard
of
the
lion
heart
was
proclaimed
as
his
successor
then
robin
and
his
men
after
earnest
debate
resolved
to
throw
themselves
upon
the
mercy
of
the
new
king
swear
allegiance
and
ask
to
be
organized
into
royal
foresters
so
will
scarlet
and
will
stutely
and
little
john
were
sent
to
london
with
this
message
which
they
were
first
to
entrust
privately
to
maid
marian
but
they
soon
returned
with
bad
tidings
the
new
king
had
formerly
set
forth
upon
a
crusade
to
the
holy
land
and
prince
john
his
brother
was
impossible
to
deal
with
being
crafty
cruel
and
treacherous
he
was
laying
his
hands
upon
all
the
property
which
could
easily
be
seized
among
other
estates
that
of
the
earl
of
huntingdon
robin
s
old
enemy
and
marian
s
father
who
had
lately
died
marian
herself
was
in
sore
straits
not
only
had
her
estates
been
taken
away
and
the
maid
been
deprived
of
the
former
protection
of
the
queen
but
the
evil
prince
john
had
persecuted
her
with
his
attentions
he
thought
that
since
the
maid
was
defenseless
he
could
carry
her
away
to
one
of
his
castles
and
none
could
gainsay
him
no
word
of
this
peril
reached
robin
s
ears
although
his
men
brought
him
word
of
the
seizure
of
the
huntingdon
lands
nathless
he
was
greatly
alarmed
for
the
safety
of
maid
marian
and
his
heart
cried
out
for
her
strongly
she
had
been
continually
in
his
thoughts
ever
since
the
memorable
shooting
at
london
town
one
morning
in
early
autumn
when
the
leaves
were
beginning
to
turn
gold
at
the
edges
the
to
swell
with
promise
of
fatness
and
the
whole
wide
woodland
was
redolent
with
the
ripe
fragrance
of
fruit
and
flower
robin
was
walking
along
the
edge
of
a
small
open
glade
busy
with
his
thoughts
the
peace
of
the
woods
was
upon
him
despite
his
broodings
of
marian
and
he
paid
little
heed
to
a
group
of
does
quietly
feeding
among
the
trees
at
the
far
edge
of
the
glade
but
presently
this
sylvan
picture
was
rudely
disturbed
for
him
a
stag
wild
and
furious
dashed
suddenly
forth
from
among
the
trees
scattering
the
does
in
swift
alarm
the
vicious
beast
eyed
the
tunic
of
robin
and
lowering
it
head
charged
at
him
impetuously
so
sudden
was
its
attack
that
robin
had
no
time
to
bend
his
bow
he
sprang
behind
a
tree
while
he
seized
his
weapon
a
moment
later
the
wild
stag
crashed
blindly
into
the
with
a
shock
which
sent
the
beast
reeling
backward
while
the
dislodged
leaves
from
the
shivering
tree
fell
in
a
small
shower
over
robin
s
head
by
my
halidom
i
am
glad
it
was
not
me
you
struck
my
gentle
friend
quoth
robin
fixing
an
arrow
upon
the
string
sorry
indeed
would
be
any
one
s
plight
who
should
encounter
you
in
this
black
scarcely
had
he
spoken
when
he
saw
the
stag
veer
about
and
fix
its
glances
rigidly
on
the
bushes
to
the
left
side
of
the
glade
these
were
parted
by
a
delicate
hand
and
through
the
opening
appeared
the
slight
figure
of
a
page
it
was
maid
marian
come
back
again
to
the
greenwood
she
advanced
unconscious
alike
of
robin
s
horrified
gaze
and
the
evil
fury
of
the
stag
she
was
directly
in
line
with
the
animal
so
robin
dared
not
launch
an
arrow
her
own
bow
was
slung
across
her
shoulder
and
her
small
sword
would
be
useless
against
the
beast
s
charge
but
now
as
she
caught
sight
of
the
stag
she
pursed
her
lips
as
though
she
would
whistle
to
it
for
the
love
of
god
dear
lady
cried
robin
and
then
the
words
died
in
his
throat
with
a
savage
snort
of
rage
the
beast
rushed
at
this
new
and
inviting
target
rushed
so
swiftly
and
from
so
short
a
distance
that
she
could
not
defend
herself
she
sprang
to
one
side
as
it
charged
down
upon
her
but
a
side
blow
from
its
antlers
stretched
her
upon
the
ground
the
stag
stopped
turned
and
lowered
its
head
preparing
to
gore
her
to
death
already
its
cruel
horns
were
coming
straight
for
her
while
she
white
of
face
and
bewildered
by
the
sudden
attack
was
struggling
to
rise
and
draw
her
sword
a
moment
more
and
the
end
would
come
but
the
sharp
voice
of
robin
and
already
spoken
down
marian
he
cried
and
the
girl
instinctively
obeyed
just
as
the
shaft
from
robin
s
bow
went
whizzing
close
above
her
head
and
struck
with
terrific
force
full
in
the
center
of
the
stag
s
forehead
the
beast
stumbled
in
its
charge
and
fell
dead
across
the
body
of
the
fainting
maid
robin
was
quickly
by
her
side
and
dragged
the
beast
from
off
the
girl
picking
her
up
in
his
strong
arms
he
bore
her
swiftly
to
the
side
of
one
of
the
many
brooks
which
watered
the
vale
he
dashed
cool
water
upon
her
face
roughly
almost
in
his
agony
of
fear
that
the
she
was
already
dead
and
he
could
have
shed
tears
of
joy
to
see
those
poor
closed
eyelids
tremble
he
redoubled
his
efforts
and
presently
she
gave
a
little
gasp
where
am
i
what
is
t
you
are
in
sherwood
dear
maid
tho
i
faith
we
gave
you
a
rude
reception
she
opened
her
eyes
and
sat
up
methinks
you
have
rescued
me
from
sudden
danger
sir
she
said
then
she
recognized
robin
for
the
first
time
and
a
radiant
smile
came
over
her
face
together
with
the
rare
blush
of
returned
vitality
and
her
head
sank
upon
his
shoulder
with
a
little
tremble
and
sigh
of
relief
oh
robin
it
is
you
she
murmured
aye
tis
i
thank
heaven
i
was
at
hand
to
do
you
service
robin
s
tones
were
deep
and
full
of
feeling
i
swear
dear
marian
that
i
will
not
let
you
from
my
care
not
another
word
was
spoken
for
some
moments
while
her
head
still
rested
confidingly
upon
his
breast
then
recollecting
he
suddenly
cried
gramercy
i
make
but
a
poor
nurse
i
have
not
even
asked
if
any
of
your
bones
were
no
not
any
she
answered
springing
lightly
to
her
feet
to
show
him
that
foolish
dizziness
o
ercame
me
for
the
nonce
but
we
can
now
proceed
on
our
nay
i
meant
not
that
he
protested
why
should
we
haste
first
tell
me
of
the
news
in
london
town
and
of
so
she
told
him
how
that
the
prince
had
seized
upon
her
father
s
lands
and
had
promised
to
restore
them
to
her
if
she
would
listen
to
his
suit
and
how
that
she
knew
he
meant
her
no
good
for
he
was
even
then
suing
for
a
princess
s
hand
that
is
all
robin
she
ended
simply
and
that
is
why
i
donned
again
my
page
s
costume
and
came
to
you
in
the
robin
s
brow
had
grown
fiercely
black
at
the
recital
of
her
wrong
and
he
had
laid
stern
hand
upon
the
hilt
of
his
sword
by
this
sword
which
queen
eleanor
gave
me
he
said
impetuously
and
which
was
devoted
to
the
service
of
all
womankind
i
take
oath
that
prince
john
and
all
his
armies
shall
not
harm
you
so
that
is
how
maid
marian
came
to
take
up
her
abode
in
the
greenwood
where
the
whole
band
of
yeomen
welcomed
her
gladly
and
swore
fealty
and
where
the
sweet
lady
of
made
her
fully
at
home
but
this
was
a
day
of
deeds
in
sherwood
forest
and
we
gan
to
tell
you
another
happening
which
led
to
later
events
while
robin
and
marian
were
having
their
encounter
with
the
stag
little
john
much
the
miller
s
son
and
will
scarlet
had
sallied
forth
to
watch
the
highroad
leading
to
barnesdale
if
perchance
they
might
find
some
haughty
knight
or
fat
priest
whose
wallet
needed
lightening
they
had
scarcely
watched
the
great
road
known
as
watling
street
which
runs
from
dover
in
kent
to
chester
town
for
many
minutes
when
they
espied
a
knight
riding
by
in
a
very
forlorn
and
careless
manner
all
dreary
was
his
semblance
and
little
was
his
pride
his
one
foot
in
the
stirrup
stood
his
other
waved
beside
his
visor
hung
down
o
er
his
eyes
he
rode
in
single
array
a
sorrier
man
than
he
was
one
rode
never
in
summer
s
day
little
john
came
up
to
the
knight
and
bade
him
stay
for
who
can
judge
of
a
man
s
wealth
by
his
looks
the
outlaw
bent
his
knee
in
all
courtesy
and
prayed
him
to
accept
the
hospitality
of
the
forest
my
master
expects
you
to
dine
with
him
quoth
he
and
indeed
has
been
fasting
while
awaiting
your
coming
these
three
who
is
your
master
asked
the
knight
none
other
than
robin
hood
replied
little
john
laying
his
hand
upon
the
knight
s
bridle
seeing
the
other
two
outlaws
approaching
the
knight
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
replied
indifferently
tis
clear
that
your
invitation
is
too
urgent
to
admit
of
refusal
quoth
he
and
i
go
with
you
right
willingly
my
friends
my
purpose
was
to
have
dined
at
blyth
or
doncaster
but
nothing
matters
so
in
the
same
lackadaisical
fashion
which
had
marked
all
his
actions
that
day
the
knight
suffered
his
horse
to
be
led
to
the
rendezvous
of
the
band
in
the
greenwood
marian
had
not
yet
had
time
to
change
her
page
s
attire
when
the
three
escorts
of
the
knight
hove
in
sight
she
recognized
their
captive
as
sir
richard
of
the
lea
whom
she
had
often
seen
at
court
and
fearing
lest
he
might
recognize
her
she
would
have
fled
but
robin
asked
her
with
a
twinkle
if
she
would
not
like
to
play
page
that
day
and
she
in
roguish
mood
consented
to
do
so
welcome
sir
knight
said
robin
courteously
you
are
come
in
good
time
for
we
were
just
preparing
to
sit
down
to
god
save
and
thank
you
good
master
robin
returned
the
knight
and
all
your
company
it
likes
me
well
to
break
the
fast
with
so
while
his
horse
was
cared
for
the
knight
laid
aside
his
own
heavy
gear
and
laved
his
face
and
hands
and
sat
down
with
robin
and
all
his
men
to
a
most
plentiful
repast
of
venison
swans
pheasants
various
small
birds
cake
and
ale
and
marian
stood
behind
robin
and
filled
his
cup
and
that
of
the
guest
after
eating
right
heartily
of
the
good
cheer
the
knight
brightened
up
greatly
and
vowed
that
he
had
not
enjoyed
so
good
a
dinner
for
nigh
three
weeks
he
also
said
that
if
ever
robin
and
his
fellows
should
come
to
his
domains
he
would
strive
to
set
them
down
to
as
good
a
dinner
on
his
own
behalf
but
this
was
not
exactly
the
sort
of
payment
which
robin
had
expected
to
receive
he
thanked
the
knight
therefore
in
set
phrase
but
reminded
him
that
a
yeoman
like
himself
might
hardly
offer
such
a
dinner
to
a
knight
as
a
gift
of
charity
i
have
no
money
master
robin
answered
the
knight
frankly
i
have
so
little
of
the
world
s
goods
in
sooth
that
i
should
be
ashamed
to
offer
you
the
whole
of
money
however
little
always
jingles
merrily
in
our
pockets
said
robin
smiling
pray
you
tell
me
what
you
deem
a
little
i
have
of
my
own
ten
silver
pennies
said
the
knight
here
they
are
and
i
wish
they
were
ten
times
as
he
handed
little
john
his
pouch
and
robin
nodded
carelessly
what
say
you
to
the
total
little
john
he
asked
as
though
in
jest
tis
true
enough
as
the
worthy
knight
hath
said
responded
the
big
fellow
gravely
emptying
the
contents
on
his
cloak
robin
signed
to
marian
who
filled
a
bumper
of
wine
for
himself
and
his
guest
pledge
me
sir
knight
cried
the
merry
outlaw
and
pledge
me
heartily
for
these
sorry
times
i
see
that
your
armor
is
bent
and
that
your
clothes
are
torn
yet
methinks
i
saw
you
at
court
once
upon
a
day
and
in
more
prosperous
guise
tell
me
now
were
you
a
yeoman
and
made
a
knight
by
force
or
have
you
been
a
bad
steward
to
yourself
and
wasted
your
property
in
lawsuits
and
the
like
be
not
bashful
with
us
we
shall
not
betray
your
i
am
a
saxon
knight
in
my
own
right
and
i
have
always
lived
a
sober
and
quiet
life
the
sorrowful
guest
replied
tis
true
you
have
seen
me
at
court
mayhap
for
i
was
an
excited
witness
of
your
shooting
before
king
harry
god
rest
his
bones
my
name
is
sir
richard
of
the
lea
and
i
dwell
in
a
castle
not
a
league
from
one
of
the
gates
of
nottingham
which
has
belonged
to
my
father
and
his
father
and
his
father
s
father
before
him
within
two
or
three
years
ago
my
neighbors
might
have
told
you
that
a
matter
of
four
hundred
pounds
one
way
or
the
other
was
as
naught
to
me
but
now
i
have
only
these
ten
pennies
of
silver
and
my
wife
and
in
what
manner
have
you
lost
your
riches
asked
robin
through
folly
and
kindness
said
the
knight
sighing
i
went
with
king
richard
upon
a
crusade
from
which
i
am
but
lately
returned
in
time
to
find
my
son
a
goodly
youth
grown
up
he
was
but
twenty
yet
he
had
achieved
a
squire
s
training
and
could
play
prettily
in
jousts
and
tournaments
and
other
knightly
games
but
about
this
time
he
had
the
ill
luck
to
push
his
sport
too
far
and
did
accidentally
kill
a
knight
in
the
open
lists
to
save
the
boy
i
had
to
sell
my
lands
and
mortgage
my
ancestral
castle
and
this
not
being
enough
in
the
end
i
have
had
to
borrow
money
at
a
ruinous
interest
from
my
lord
of
a
most
worthy
bishop
said
robin
ironically
what
is
the
sum
of
your
debt
four
hundred
pounds
said
sir
richard
and
the
bishop
swears
he
will
foreclose
the
mortgage
if
they
are
not
paid
have
you
any
friends
who
would
become
surety
for
you
not
one
if
good
king
richard
were
here
the
tale
might
be
fill
your
goblet
again
sir
knight
said
robin
and
he
turned
to
whisper
a
word
in
marian
s
ear
she
nodded
and
drew
little
john
and
will
scarlet
aside
and
talked
earnestly
with
them
in
a
low
tone
here
is
health
and
prosperity
to
you
gallant
robin
said
sir
richard
tilting
his
goblet
i
hope
i
may
pay
your
cheer
more
worthily
the
next
time
i
ride
will
scarlet
and
little
john
had
meanwhile
fallen
in
with
marian
s
idea
for
they
consulted
the
other
outlaws
who
nodded
their
heads
thereupon
little
john
and
will
scarlet
went
into
the
cave
near
by
and
presently
returned
bearing
a
bag
of
gold
this
they
counted
out
before
the
astonished
knight
and
there
were
four
times
one
hundred
gold
pieces
in
it
take
this
loan
from
us
sir
knight
and
pay
your
debt
to
the
bishop
then
said
robin
nay
no
thanks
you
are
but
exchanging
creditors
mayhap
we
shall
not
be
so
hard
upon
you
as
the
christian
bishop
yet
again
we
may
be
harder
who
can
tell
there
were
actual
tears
in
sir
richard
s
eyes
as
he
essayed
to
thank
the
foresters
but
at
this
juncture
much
the
miller
s
son
came
from
the
cave
dragging
a
bale
of
cloth
the
knight
should
have
a
suit
worthy
of
his
rank
master
think
you
not
so
measure
him
twenty
ells
of
it
ordered
robin
give
him
a
good
horse
also
whispered
marian
tis
a
gift
which
will
come
back
for
this
is
a
worthy
man
i
know
him
so
the
horse
was
given
also
and
robin
bade
ride
with
the
knight
as
far
as
his
castle
as
esquire
the
knight
was
sorrowful
no
longer
yet
he
could
hardly
voice
his
thanks
through
his
broken
utterance
and
having
spent
the
night
in
rest
after
listening
to
s
singing
he
mounted
his
new
steed
the
following
morning
an
altogether
different
man
god
save
you
comrades
and
keep
you
all
said
he
with
deep
feeling
in
his
tones
and
give
me
a
grateful
heart
we
shall
wait
for
you
twelve
months
from
here
in
this
place
said
robin
shaking
him
by
the
hand
and
then
you
will
repay
us
the
loan
if
you
have
been
i
shall
return
it
to
you
within
the
year
upon
my
honor
as
sir
richard
of
the
lea
and
for
all
time
pray
count
on
me
as
a
steadfast
so
saying
the
knight
and
his
esquire
rode
down
the
forest
glade
till
they
were
lost
to
view
chapter
xvii
how
the
bishop
was
dined
o
what
is
the
matter
then
said
the
bishop
or
for
whom
do
you
make
this
or
why
do
you
kill
the
king
s
venison
when
your
company
is
so
few
we
are
shepherds
quoth
bold
robin
hood
and
we
keep
sheep
all
the
year
and
we
are
disposed
to
be
merrie
this
day
and
to
kill
of
the
king
s
fat
not
many
days
after
sir
richard
of
the
lea
came
to
sherwood
forest
word
reached
robin
hood
s
ears
that
my
lord
bishop
of
hereford
would
be
riding
that
way
betimes
on
that
morning
twas
the
knight
s
quondam
esquire
who
brought
the
tidings
and
robin
s
face
brightened
as
he
heard
it
now
by
our
lady
quoth
he
i
have
long
desired
to
entertain
my
lord
in
the
greenwood
and
this
is
too
fair
a
chance
to
let
slip
come
my
men
kill
me
a
venison
kill
me
a
good
fat
deer
the
bishop
of
hereford
is
to
dine
with
me
today
and
he
shall
pay
well
for
his
shall
we
dress
it
here
as
usual
asked
much
the
miller
s
son
nay
we
play
a
droll
game
on
the
churchman
we
will
dress
it
by
the
highway
side
and
watch
for
the
bishop
narrowly
lest
he
should
ride
some
other
so
robin
gave
his
orders
and
the
main
body
of
his
men
dispersed
to
different
parts
of
the
forest
under
will
stutely
and
little
john
to
watch
other
roads
while
robin
hood
himself
took
six
of
his
men
including
will
scarlet
and
much
and
posted
himself
in
full
view
of
the
main
road
this
little
company
appeared
funny
enough
i
assure
you
for
they
had
disguised
themselves
as
shepherds
robin
had
an
old
wool
cap
with
a
tail
to
it
hanging
over
his
ear
and
a
shock
of
hair
stood
straight
up
through
a
hole
in
the
top
besides
there
was
so
much
dirt
on
his
face
that
you
would
never
have
known
him
an
old
tattered
cloak
over
his
hunter
s
garb
completed
his
the
others
were
no
less
ragged
and
unkempt
even
the
foppish
will
scarlet
being
so
badly
run
down
at
the
heel
that
the
court
ladies
would
hardly
have
had
speech
with
him
they
quickly
provided
themselves
with
a
deer
and
made
great
preparations
to
cook
it
over
a
small
fire
when
a
little
dust
was
seen
blowing
along
the
highway
and
out
of
it
came
the
portly
bishop
cantering
along
with
ten
at
his
heels
as
soon
as
he
saw
the
fancied
shepherds
he
spurred
up
his
horse
and
came
straight
toward
them
who
are
ye
fellows
who
make
so
free
with
the
king
s
deer
he
asked
sharply
we
are
shepherds
answered
robin
hood
pulling
at
his
forelock
awkwardly
heaven
have
mercy
ye
seem
a
sorry
lot
of
shepherds
but
who
gave
you
leave
to
cease
eating
mutton
tis
one
of
our
feast
days
lording
and
we
were
disposed
to
be
merry
this
day
and
make
free
with
a
deer
out
here
where
they
are
so
by
me
faith
the
king
shall
hear
of
this
who
killed
yon
beast
give
me
first
your
name
excellence
so
that
i
may
speak
where
tis
fitting
replied
robin
stubbornly
tis
my
lord
bishop
of
hereford
fellow
interposed
one
of
the
guards
fiercely
see
that
you
keep
a
civil
tongue
in
your
if
tis
a
churchman
retorted
will
scarlet
he
would
do
better
to
mind
his
own
flocks
rather
than
concern
himself
with
ye
are
saucy
fellows
in
sooth
cried
the
bishop
and
we
will
see
if
your
heads
will
pay
for
your
manners
come
quit
your
stolen
roast
and
march
along
with
me
for
you
shall
be
brought
before
the
sheriff
of
nottingham
pardon
excellence
said
robin
dropping
on
his
knees
pardon
i
pray
you
it
becomes
not
your
lordship
s
coat
to
take
so
many
lives
faith
i
ll
pardon
you
said
the
bishop
i
ll
pardon
you
when
i
see
you
hanged
seize
upon
them
my
men
but
robin
had
already
sprung
away
with
his
back
against
a
tree
and
from
underneath
his
ragged
cloak
he
drew
his
trusty
horn
and
winded
the
piercing
notes
which
were
wont
to
summon
the
band
the
bishop
no
sooner
saw
this
action
than
he
knew
his
man
and
that
there
was
a
trap
set
and
being
an
arrant
coward
he
wheeled
his
horse
sharply
and
would
have
made
off
down
the
road
but
his
own
men
spurred
on
the
charge
blocked
his
way
at
almost
the
same
instant
the
bushes
round
about
seemed
literally
to
become
alive
with
outlaws
little
john
s
men
came
from
one
side
and
will
stutely
s
from
the
other
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
it
the
worthy
bishop
found
himself
a
prisoner
and
began
to
crave
mercy
from
the
men
he
had
so
lately
been
ready
to
sentence
o
pardon
o
pardon
said
the
bishop
o
pardon
i
you
pray
for
if
i
had
known
it
had
been
you
i
d
have
gone
some
other
i
owe
you
no
pardon
retorted
robin
but
i
will
e
en
treat
you
better
than
you
would
have
treated
me
come
make
haste
and
go
along
with
me
i
have
already
planned
that
you
shall
dine
with
me
this
so
the
unwilling
prelate
was
dragged
away
cheek
by
jowl
with
the
venison
upon
the
back
of
his
own
horse
and
robin
and
his
band
took
charge
of
the
whole
company
and
led
them
through
the
forest
glades
till
they
came
to
an
open
space
near
barnesdale
here
they
rested
and
robin
gave
the
bishop
a
seat
full
courteously
much
the
miller
s
son
fell
to
roasting
the
deer
afresh
while
another
and
fatter
beast
was
set
to
frizzle
on
the
other
side
of
the
fire
presently
the
appetizing
odor
of
the
cooking
reached
the
bishop
s
nostrils
and
he
sniffed
it
eagerly
the
morning
s
ride
had
made
him
hungry
and
he
was
nothing
loath
when
they
bade
him
come
to
the
dinner
robin
gave
him
the
best
place
beside
himself
and
the
bishop
prepared
to
fall
to
nay
my
lord
craving
your
pardon
but
we
are
accustomed
to
have
grace
before
meat
said
robin
decorously
and
as
our
own
chaplain
is
not
with
us
will
you
be
good
enough
to
say
it
for
us
the
bishop
reddened
but
pronounced
grace
in
the
latin
tongue
hastily
and
then
settled
himself
to
make
the
best
of
his
lot
red
wines
and
ale
were
brought
forth
and
poured
out
each
man
having
a
horn
tankard
from
which
to
drink
laughter
bubbled
among
the
diners
and
the
bishop
caught
himself
smiling
at
more
than
one
jest
but
who
in
sooth
could
resist
a
freshly
broiled
venison
streak
eaten
out
in
the
open
air
to
the
tune
of
jest
and
good
fellowship
stutely
filled
the
bishop
s
beaker
with
wine
each
time
he
emptied
it
and
the
bishop
got
mellower
and
mellower
as
the
afternoon
shades
lengthened
on
toward
sunset
then
the
approaching
dusk
warned
him
of
his
position
i
wish
mine
host
quoth
he
gravely
to
robin
who
had
soberly
drunk
but
one
cup
of
ale
that
you
would
now
call
a
reckoning
tis
late
and
i
fear
the
cost
of
this
entertainment
may
be
more
than
my
poor
purse
can
for
he
bethought
himself
of
his
friend
the
sheriff
s
former
experience
verily
your
lordship
said
robin
scratching
his
head
i
have
enjoyed
your
company
so
much
that
i
scarce
know
how
to
charge
for
lend
me
your
purse
my
lord
said
little
john
interposing
and
i
ll
give
you
the
reckoning
by
and
the
bishop
shuddered
he
had
collected
sir
richard
s
debt
only
that
morning
and
was
even
then
carrying
it
home
i
have
but
a
few
silver
pennies
of
my
own
he
whined
and
as
for
the
gold
in
my
tis
for
the
church
ye
surely
would
not
levy
upon
the
church
good
but
little
john
was
already
gone
to
the
and
returning
he
laid
the
bishop
s
cloak
upon
the
ground
and
poured
out
of
the
portmantua
a
matter
of
four
hundred
glittering
gold
pieces
twas
the
identical
money
which
robin
had
lent
sir
richard
a
short
while
before
ah
said
robin
as
though
an
idea
had
but
just
then
come
to
him
the
church
is
always
willing
to
aid
in
charity
and
seeing
this
goodly
sum
reminds
me
that
i
have
a
friend
who
is
indebted
to
a
churchman
for
this
exact
amount
now
we
shall
charge
you
nothing
on
our
own
account
but
suffer
us
to
make
use
of
this
in
aiding
my
good
nay
nay
began
the
bishop
with
a
wry
face
this
is
requiting
me
ill
indeed
was
this
not
the
king
s
meat
after
all
that
we
feasted
upon
furthermore
i
am
a
poor
poor
forsooth
answered
robin
in
scorn
you
are
the
bishop
of
hereford
and
does
not
the
whole
countryside
speak
of
your
oppression
who
does
not
know
of
your
cruelty
to
the
poor
and
ignorant
you
who
should
use
your
great
office
to
aid
them
instead
of
oppress
have
you
not
been
guilty
of
far
greater
robbery
than
this
even
though
less
open
of
myself
and
how
you
have
pursued
me
i
say
nothing
nor
of
your
unjust
enmity
against
my
father
but
on
account
of
those
you
have
despoiled
and
oppressed
i
take
this
money
and
will
use
it
far
more
worthily
than
you
would
god
be
my
witness
in
this
there
is
an
end
of
the
matter
unless
you
will
lead
us
in
a
song
or
dance
to
show
that
your
body
had
a
better
spirit
than
your
mind
come
strike
up
the
harp
allan
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
will
i
do
snarled
the
bishop
faith
then
we
must
help
you
said
little
john
and
he
and
seized
the
fat
struggling
churchman
and
commenced
to
hop
up
and
down
the
bishop
being
shorter
must
perforce
accompany
them
in
their
gyrations
while
the
whole
company
sat
and
rolled
about
over
the
ground
and
roared
to
see
my
lord
of
hereford
s
queer
capers
at
last
he
sank
in
a
heap
fuddled
with
wine
and
quite
exhausted
little
john
picked
him
up
as
though
he
were
a
log
of
wood
and
carrying
him
to
his
horse
set
him
astride
facing
the
animal
s
tail
and
thus
fastened
him
leading
the
animal
toward
the
highroad
and
starting
the
bishop
more
dead
than
alive
toward
nottingham
chapter
xviii
how
the
bishop
went
the
bishop
he
came
to
the
old
woman
s
house
and
called
with
furious
mood
come
let
me
soon
see
and
bring
unto
me
that
traitor
robin
the
easy
success
with
which
they
had
got
the
better
of
the
good
bishop
led
robin
to
be
a
little
careless
he
thought
that
his
guest
was
too
great
a
coward
to
venture
back
into
the
greenwood
for
many
a
long
day
and
so
after
lying
quiet
for
one
day
the
outlaw
ventured
boldly
upon
the
highway
the
morning
of
the
second
but
he
had
gone
only
half
a
mile
when
turning
a
sharp
bend
in
the
road
he
plunged
full
upon
the
prelate
himself
my
lord
of
hereford
had
been
so
deeply
smitten
in
his
pride
that
he
had
lost
no
time
in
summoning
a
considerable
body
of
the
sheriff
s
men
offering
to
double
the
reward
if
robin
hood
could
be
come
upon
this
company
was
now
at
his
heels
and
after
the
first
shock
of
mutual
surprise
the
bishop
gave
an
exultant
shout
and
spurred
upon
the
outlaw
it
was
too
late
for
robin
to
retreat
by
the
way
he
had
come
but
quick
as
a
flash
he
sprang
to
one
side
of
the
road
dodged
under
some
bushes
and
disappeared
so
suddenly
that
his
pursuers
thought
he
had
truly
been
swallowed
up
by
magic
after
him
yelled
the
bishop
some
of
you
beat
up
the
woods
around
him
while
the
rest
of
us
will
keep
on
the
main
road
and
head
him
off
on
the
other
side
for
truth
to
tell
the
bishop
did
not
care
to
trust
his
bones
away
from
the
highroad
about
a
mile
away
on
the
other
side
of
this
neck
of
woods
wherein
robin
had
been
trapped
was
a
little
tumbledown
cottage
twas
where
the
widow
lived
whose
three
sons
had
been
rescued
robin
remembered
the
cottage
and
saw
his
one
chance
to
escape
doubling
in
and
out
among
the
underbrush
and
heather
with
the
agility
of
a
hare
he
soon
came
out
of
the
wood
in
the
rear
of
the
cottage
and
thrust
his
head
through
a
tiny
window
the
widow
who
had
been
at
her
spinning
wheel
rose
up
with
a
cry
of
alarm
quiet
good
mother
tis
i
robin
hood
where
are
your
three
sons
they
should
be
with
you
robin
well
do
you
know
that
do
they
not
owe
their
lives
to
you
if
that
be
so
i
come
to
seek
payment
of
the
debt
said
robin
in
a
breath
the
bishop
is
on
my
heels
with
many
of
his
i
ll
cheat
the
bishop
and
all
cried
the
woman
quickly
here
robin
change
your
raiment
with
me
and
we
will
see
if
my
lord
knows
an
old
woman
when
he
sees
good
said
robin
pass
your
gray
cloak
out
the
window
and
also
your
spindle
and
twine
and
i
will
give
you
my
green
mantle
and
everything
else
down
to
my
bow
and
while
they
were
talking
robin
had
been
nimbly
changing
clothes
with
the
old
woman
through
the
window
and
in
a
jiffy
he
stood
forth
complete
even
to
the
spindle
and
twine
presently
up
dashed
the
bishop
and
his
men
and
at
sight
of
the
cottage
and
the
old
woman
gave
pause
the
crone
was
hobbling
along
with
difficulty
leaning
heavily
upon
a
gnarled
stick
and
bearing
the
spindle
on
her
other
arm
she
would
have
gone
by
the
bishop
s
company
while
muttering
to
herself
but
the
bishop
ordered
one
of
his
men
to
question
her
the
soldier
laid
his
hand
upon
her
shoulder
mind
your
business
croaked
the
woman
or
i
ll
curse
ye
come
come
my
good
woman
said
the
soldier
who
really
was
afraid
of
her
curses
i
ll
not
molest
you
but
my
lord
bishop
of
hereford
wants
to
know
if
you
have
seen
aught
of
the
outlaw
robin
hood
and
why
shouldn
t
i
see
him
she
whined
where
s
the
king
or
law
to
prevent
good
robin
from
coming
to
see
me
and
bring
me
food
and
raiment
that
s
more
than
my
lord
bishop
will
do
i
warrant
ye
peace
woman
said
the
bishop
harshly
we
want
none
of
your
opinions
but
we
ll
take
you
to
barnesdale
and
burn
you
for
a
witch
if
you
do
not
instantly
tell
us
when
you
last
saw
robin
mercy
good
my
lord
chattered
the
crone
falling
on
her
knees
robin
is
there
in
my
cottage
now
but
you
ll
never
take
him
we
ll
see
about
that
cried
the
bishop
triumphantly
enter
the
cottage
my
men
fire
it
if
need
be
but
i
ll
give
a
purse
of
gold
pieces
above
the
reward
to
the
man
who
captures
the
outlaw
the
old
woman
being
released
went
on
her
way
slowly
but
it
might
have
been
noticed
that
the
farther
she
got
away
from
the
company
and
the
nearer
to
the
edge
of
the
woods
the
swifter
and
straighter
grew
her
pace
once
inside
the
shelter
of
the
forest
she
broke
into
a
run
of
surprising
swiftness
gadzooks
exclaimed
little
john
who
presently
spied
her
who
comes
here
never
saw
i
witch
or
woman
run
so
fast
methinks
i
ll
send
an
arrow
close
over
her
head
to
see
which
it
o
hold
your
hand
hold
your
hand
panted
the
supposed
woman
tis
i
robin
hood
summon
the
yeomen
and
return
with
me
speedily
we
have
still
another
score
to
settle
with
my
lord
of
when
little
john
could
catch
his
breath
from
laughing
he
winded
his
horn
now
mistress
robin
quoth
he
grinning
lead
on
we
ll
be
close
to
your
meanwhile
back
at
the
widow
s
cottage
the
bishop
was
growing
more
furious
every
moment
for
all
his
bold
words
he
dared
not
fire
the
house
and
the
sturdy
door
had
thus
far
resisted
all
his
men
s
efforts
break
it
down
break
it
down
he
shouted
and
let
me
soon
see
who
will
fetch
out
that
traitor
robin
hood
at
last
the
door
crashed
in
and
the
men
stood
guard
on
the
threshold
but
not
one
dared
enter
for
fear
a
sharp
arrow
should
meet
him
halfway
here
he
is
cried
one
fellow
peering
in
i
see
him
in
the
corner
by
the
cupboard
shall
we
slay
him
with
our
pikes
nay
said
the
bishop
take
him
alive
if
you
can
we
ll
make
the
biggest
public
hanging
of
this
that
the
shire
ever
but
the
joy
of
the
bishop
over
his
capture
was
short
lived
down
the
road
came
striding
the
shabby
figure
of
the
old
woman
who
had
helped
him
set
the
trap
and
very
wrathy
was
she
when
she
saw
that
the
cottage
door
had
been
battered
in
stand
by
you
lazy
rascals
she
called
to
the
soldiers
may
all
the
devils
catch
ye
for
hurting
an
old
woman
s
hut
stand
by
i
say
hold
your
tongue
ordered
the
bishop
these
are
my
men
and
carrying
out
my
swore
the
beldame
harshly
things
have
come
to
a
pretty
pass
when
our
homes
may
be
treated
like
common
gaols
couldn
t
all
your
men
catch
one
poor
forester
without
this
ado
come
clear
out
you
and
your
robber
on
the
instant
or
i
ll
curse
every
mother
s
son
of
ye
eating
and
drinking
and
sleeping
seize
on
the
hag
shouted
the
bishop
as
soon
as
he
could
get
in
a
word
we
ll
see
about
a
witch
s
cursing
back
to
town
she
shall
go
alongside
of
robin
not
so
fast
your
worship
she
retorted
clapping
her
hands
and
at
the
signal
a
goodly
array
of
greenwood
men
sprang
forth
from
all
sides
of
the
cottage
with
bows
drawn
back
threateningly
the
bishop
saw
that
his
men
were
trapped
again
for
they
dared
not
stir
nathless
he
determined
to
make
a
fight
for
it
if
one
of
you
but
budge
an
inch
toward
me
you
rascals
he
cried
it
shall
sound
the
death
of
your
master
robin
hood
my
men
have
him
here
under
their
pikes
and
i
shall
command
them
to
kill
him
without
faith
i
should
like
to
see
the
robin
you
have
caught
said
a
clear
voice
from
under
the
widow
s
cape
and
the
outlaw
chief
stood
forth
with
bared
head
smilingly
here
am
i
my
lord
in
no
wise
imperiled
by
your
men
s
fierce
pikes
so
let
us
see
whom
you
have
been
guarding
so
the
old
woman
who
in
the
garb
of
robin
hood
had
been
lying
quiet
in
the
cottage
through
all
the
uproar
jumped
up
nimbly
at
this
in
the
bald
absurdity
of
her
disguise
she
came
to
the
doorway
and
bowed
to
the
bishop
give
you
my
lord
bishop
she
piped
in
a
shrill
voice
and
what
does
your
grace
at
my
humble
door
do
you
come
to
bless
me
and
give
me
alms
aye
that
does
he
answered
robin
we
shall
see
if
his
contain
enough
to
pay
you
for
that
battered
now
by
all
the
saints
began
the
bishop
take
care
they
are
all
watching
you
interrupted
robin
so
name
them
not
upon
your
unchurchly
lips
but
i
will
trouble
you
to
hand
over
that
purse
of
gold
you
had
saved
to
pay
for
my
i
ll
see
you
hanged
first
raged
the
bishop
stating
no
more
than
what
would
have
been
so
if
he
could
do
the
ordering
of
things
have
at
them
my
men
and
hew
them
down
in
their
tracks
hold
retorted
robin
see
how
we
have
you
at
our
and
aiming
a
sudden
shaft
he
shot
so
close
to
the
bishop
s
head
that
it
carried
away
both
his
hat
and
the
which
he
always
wore
leaving
him
quite
bald
the
prelate
turned
as
white
as
his
shiny
head
and
clutched
wildly
at
his
ears
he
thought
himself
dead
almost
help
murder
he
gasped
do
not
shoot
again
here
s
your
purse
of
gold
and
without
waiting
for
further
parley
he
fairly
bolted
down
the
road
his
men
being
left
leaderless
had
nothing
for
it
but
to
retreat
after
him
which
they
did
in
sullen
order
covered
by
the
bows
of
the
yeomen
and
thus
ended
the
bishop
of
hereford
s
great
in
the
forest
chapter
xix
how
the
sheriff
held
another
shooting
match
to
tell
the
truth
i
m
well
informed
yon
match
it
is
a
wile
the
sheriff
i
know
devises
this
us
archers
to
now
the
sheriff
was
so
greatly
troubled
in
heart
over
the
growing
power
of
robin
hood
that
he
did
a
very
foolish
thing
he
went
to
london
town
to
lay
his
troubles
before
the
king
and
get
another
force
of
troops
to
cope
with
the
outlaws
king
richard
was
not
yet
returned
from
the
holy
land
but
prince
john
heard
him
with
scorn
pooh
said
he
shrugging
his
shoulders
what
have
i
to
do
with
all
this
art
thou
not
sheriff
for
me
the
law
is
in
force
to
take
thy
course
of
them
that
injure
thee
go
get
thee
gone
and
by
thyself
devise
some
tricking
game
to
trap
these
rebels
and
never
let
me
see
thy
face
at
court
again
until
thou
hast
a
better
tale
to
so
away
went
the
sheriff
in
sorrier
pass
than
ever
and
cudgeled
his
brain
on
the
way
home
for
some
plan
of
action
his
daughter
met
him
on
his
return
and
saw
at
once
that
he
had
been
on
a
poor
mission
she
was
minded
to
upbraid
him
when
she
learned
what
he
had
told
the
prince
but
the
words
of
the
latter
started
her
to
thinking
afresh
i
have
it
she
exclaimed
at
length
why
should
we
not
hold
another
tis
fair
year
as
you
know
and
another
tourney
will
be
expected
now
we
will
proclaim
a
general
amnesty
as
did
king
harry
himself
and
say
that
the
field
is
open
and
unmolested
to
all
comers
belike
robin
hood
s
men
will
be
tempted
to
twang
the
bow
and
then
and
then
said
the
sheriff
jumping
up
with
alacrity
we
shall
see
on
which
side
of
the
gate
they
stop
so
the
sheriff
lost
no
time
in
proclaiming
a
tourney
to
be
held
that
same
fall
at
the
fair
it
was
open
to
all
comers
said
the
proclamation
and
none
should
be
molested
in
their
going
and
coming
furthermore
an
arrow
with
a
golden
head
and
shaft
of
should
be
given
to
the
winner
who
would
be
heralded
abroad
as
the
finest
archer
in
all
the
north
countree
also
many
rich
prizes
were
to
be
given
to
other
clever
archers
these
tidings
came
in
due
course
to
robin
hood
under
the
greenwood
tree
and
fired
his
impetuous
spirit
come
prepare
ye
my
merry
men
all
quoth
he
and
we
ll
go
to
the
fair
and
take
some
part
in
this
with
that
stepped
forth
the
merry
cobbler
david
of
doncaster
master
quoth
he
be
ruled
by
me
and
stir
not
from
the
greenwood
to
tell
the
truth
i
m
well
informed
yon
match
is
naught
but
a
trap
i
know
the
sheriff
has
devised
it
to
beguile
us
archers
into
some
that
word
savors
of
the
coward
replied
robin
and
pleases
me
not
let
come
what
will
i
ll
try
my
skill
at
that
same
then
up
spoke
little
john
and
said
come
listen
to
me
how
it
shall
be
that
we
will
not
be
our
mantles
all
of
behind
us
we
will
leave
we
ll
dress
us
all
so
several
they
shall
not
us
one
shall
wear
white
another
red
one
yellow
another
blue
thus
in
disguise
to
the
exercise
we
ll
go
whate
er
this
advice
met
with
general
favor
from
the
adventurous
fellows
and
they
lost
no
time
in
putting
it
into
practice
maid
marian
and
mistress
dale
assisted
by
friar
tuck
prepared
some
costumes
and
gainst
the
fair
day
had
fitted
out
the
sevenscore
men
till
you
would
never
have
taken
them
for
other
than
villagers
decked
for
the
holiday
and
forth
went
they
from
the
greenwood
with
hearts
all
firm
and
stout
resolved
to
meet
the
sheriff
s
men
and
have
a
merry
bout
along
the
highway
they
fell
in
with
many
other
bold
fellows
from
the
countryside
going
with
their
lasses
toward
the
gates
of
nottingham
so
in
through
the
gates
trooped
the
whole
gay
company
robin
s
men
behaving
as
awkwardly
and
laughing
and
talking
as
noisily
as
the
rest
while
the
sheriff
s
scowling
stood
round
about
and
sought
to
find
one
who
looked
like
a
forester
but
without
avail
the
herald
now
set
forth
the
terms
of
the
contest
as
on
former
occasions
and
the
shooting
presently
began
robin
had
chosen
five
of
his
men
to
shoot
with
him
and
the
rest
were
to
mingle
with
the
crowd
and
also
watch
the
gates
these
five
were
little
john
will
scarlet
will
stutely
much
and
the
other
competitors
made
a
brave
showing
on
the
first
round
especially
gilbert
of
the
white
hand
who
was
present
and
never
shot
better
the
contest
later
narrowed
down
between
gilbert
and
robin
but
at
the
first
lead
when
the
butts
were
struck
so
truly
by
various
well
known
archers
the
sheriff
was
in
doubt
whether
to
feel
glad
or
sorry
he
was
glad
to
see
such
skill
but
sorry
that
the
outlaws
were
not
in
it
some
said
if
robin
hood
were
here
and
all
his
men
to
boot
sure
none
of
them
could
pass
these
men
so
bravely
do
they
aye
quoth
the
sheriff
and
scratched
his
head
i
thought
he
would
be
here
i
thought
he
would
but
tho
he
s
bold
he
durst
not
now
this
word
was
privately
brought
to
robin
by
david
of
doncaster
and
the
saying
vexed
him
sorely
but
he
bit
his
lip
in
silence
ere
long
he
thought
to
himself
we
shall
see
whether
robin
hood
be
here
or
not
meantime
the
shooting
had
been
going
forward
and
robin
s
men
had
done
so
well
that
the
air
was
filled
with
shouts
one
cried
blue
jacket
another
cried
brown
and
a
third
cried
brave
yellow
but
the
fourth
man
said
yon
man
in
red
in
this
place
has
no
for
that
was
robin
hood
himself
for
he
was
clothed
in
red
at
every
shot
the
prize
he
got
for
he
was
both
sure
and
dead
thus
went
the
second
round
of
the
shooting
and
thus
the
third
and
last
till
even
gilbert
of
the
white
hand
was
fairly
beaten
during
all
this
shooting
robin
exchanged
no
word
with
his
men
each
treating
the
other
as
a
perfect
stranger
nathless
such
great
shooting
could
not
pass
without
revealing
the
archers
the
sheriff
thought
he
discovered
in
the
winner
of
the
golden
arrow
the
person
of
robin
hood
without
peradventure
so
he
sent
word
privately
for
his
to
close
round
the
group
but
robin
s
men
also
got
wind
of
the
plan
to
keep
up
appearances
the
sheriff
summoned
the
crowd
to
form
in
a
circle
and
after
as
much
delay
as
possible
the
arrow
was
presented
the
delay
gave
time
enough
for
the
soldiers
to
close
in
as
robin
received
his
prize
bowed
awkwardly
and
turned
away
the
sheriff
letting
his
zeal
get
the
better
of
his
discretion
grasped
him
about
the
neck
and
called
upon
his
men
to
arrest
the
traitor
but
the
moment
the
sheriff
touched
robin
he
received
such
a
buffet
on
the
side
of
his
head
that
he
let
go
instantly
and
fell
back
several
paces
turning
to
see
who
had
struck
him
he
recognized
little
john
ah
rascal
greenleaf
i
have
you
now
he
exclaimed
springing
at
him
just
then
however
he
met
a
new
check
this
is
from
another
of
your
devoted
servants
said
a
voice
which
he
knew
to
be
that
of
much
the
miller
s
son
and
thwack
went
his
open
palm
upon
the
sheriff
s
cheek
sending
that
worthy
rolling
over
and
over
upon
the
ground
by
this
time
the
conflict
had
become
general
but
the
sheriff
s
men
suffered
the
disadvantage
of
being
hampered
by
the
crowd
of
innocent
whom
they
could
not
tell
from
the
outlaws
and
so
dared
not
attack
while
the
other
outlaws
in
the
rear
fell
upon
them
and
put
them
in
confusion
for
a
moment
a
fierce
rain
of
blows
ensued
then
the
clear
from
robin
ordered
a
retreat
the
two
warders
at
the
nearest
gate
tried
to
close
it
but
were
shot
dead
in
their
tracks
david
of
doncaster
threw
a
third
soldier
into
the
moat
and
out
through
the
gate
went
the
foresters
in
good
order
keeping
a
respectful
distance
between
themselves
and
the
advancing
soldiery
by
means
of
their
shafts
but
the
fight
was
not
to
go
easily
this
day
for
the
soldiery
smarting
from
their
recent
discomfiture
at
the
widow
s
cottage
and
knowing
that
the
eyes
of
the
whole
shire
were
upon
them
fought
well
and
pressed
closely
after
the
retreating
outlaws
more
than
one
ugly
wound
was
given
and
received
no
less
than
five
of
the
sheriff
s
men
were
killed
outright
and
a
dozen
others
injured
while
four
of
robin
s
men
were
bleeding
from
severe
flesh
cuts
then
little
john
who
had
fought
by
the
side
of
his
chief
suddenly
fell
forward
with
a
slight
moan
an
arrow
had
pierced
his
knee
robin
seized
the
big
fellow
with
almost
superhuman
strength
up
he
took
him
on
his
back
and
bare
him
well
a
mile
many
a
time
he
laid
him
down
and
shot
another
while
meanwhile
little
john
grew
weaker
and
closed
his
eyes
at
last
he
sank
to
the
ground
and
feebly
motioned
robin
to
let
him
lie
master
robin
said
he
have
i
not
served
you
well
ever
since
we
met
upon
the
bridge
truer
servant
never
man
had
answered
robin
then
if
ever
you
loved
me
and
for
the
sake
of
that
service
draw
your
bright
brown
sword
and
strike
off
my
head
never
let
me
fall
alive
into
the
hand
of
the
sheriff
of
not
for
all
the
gold
in
england
would
i
do
either
of
the
things
you
god
forbid
cried
hurrying
to
the
rescue
and
packing
his
wounded
kinsman
upon
his
own
broad
shoulders
he
soon
brought
him
within
the
shelter
of
the
forest
once
there
the
sheriff
s
men
did
not
follow
and
robin
caused
litters
of
boughs
to
be
made
for
little
john
and
the
other
four
wounded
men
quickly
were
they
carried
through
the
wood
until
the
hermitage
of
friar
tuck
was
reached
where
their
wounds
were
dressed
little
john
s
hurt
was
pronounced
to
be
the
most
serious
of
any
but
he
was
assured
that
in
two
or
three
weeks
time
he
could
get
about
again
whereat
the
active
giant
groaned
mightily
that
evening
consternation
came
upon
the
hearts
of
the
band
a
careful
was
taken
to
see
it
all
the
yeomen
had
escaped
when
it
was
found
that
will
stutely
was
missing
and
maid
marian
also
was
nowhere
to
be
found
robin
was
seized
with
dread
he
knew
that
marian
had
gone
to
the
fair
but
felt
that
she
would
hardly
come
to
grief
her
absence
however
portended
some
danger
and
he
feared
that
it
was
connected
with
will
stutely
the
sheriff
would
hang
him
speedily
and
without
mercy
if
he
were
captured
the
rest
of
the
band
shared
their
leader
s
uneasiness
though
they
said
no
word
they
knew
that
if
will
were
captured
the
battle
must
be
fought
over
again
the
next
day
and
will
must
be
saved
at
any
cost
but
no
man
flinched
from
the
prospect
that
evening
while
the
sheriff
and
his
wife
and
daughter
sat
at
meat
in
the
mansion
house
the
sheriff
boasted
of
how
he
would
make
an
example
of
the
captured
outlaw
for
stutely
had
indeed
fallen
into
his
hands
he
shall
be
strung
high
he
said
in
a
loud
voice
and
none
shall
dare
lift
a
finger
i
now
have
robin
hood
s
men
on
the
run
and
we
shall
soon
see
who
is
master
in
this
shire
i
am
only
sorry
that
we
let
them
have
the
golden
as
he
spoke
a
missive
sped
through
a
window
and
fell
clattering
upon
his
plate
causing
him
to
spring
back
in
alarm
it
was
the
golden
arrow
and
on
its
feathered
shaft
was
sewed
a
little
note
which
read
this
from
one
who
will
take
no
gifts
from
liars
and
who
henceforth
will
show
no
mercy
look
well
to
yourself
chapter
xx
how
will
stutely
was
rescued
forth
of
the
greenwood
are
they
gone
yea
all
courageously
resolving
to
bring
stutely
home
or
every
man
to
die
the
next
day
dawned
bright
and
sunny
the
whole
face
of
nature
seemed
gay
as
if
in
despite
of
the
tragedy
which
was
soon
to
take
place
in
the
walls
of
nottingham
town
the
gates
were
not
opened
upon
this
day
for
the
sheriff
was
determined
to
carry
through
the
hanging
of
will
stutely
undisturbed
no
man
therefore
was
to
be
allowed
entrance
from
without
all
that
morning
and
until
after
the
fatal
hour
of
noon
when
will
s
soul
was
to
be
launched
into
eternity
early
in
the
day
robin
had
drawn
his
men
to
a
point
as
near
as
he
dared
in
the
wood
where
he
could
watch
the
road
leading
to
the
east
gate
he
himself
was
clad
in
a
bright
scarlet
dress
while
his
men
a
goodly
array
wore
their
suits
of
sober
lincoln
green
they
were
armed
with
broadswords
and
each
man
carried
his
bow
and
a
full
quiver
of
new
arrows
straightened
and
sharpened
cunningly
by
middle
the
tinker
over
their
greenwood
dress
each
man
had
thrown
a
rough
mantle
making
him
look
not
unlike
a
friar
i
hold
it
good
comrades
then
said
robin
hood
to
tarry
here
in
hiding
for
a
season
while
we
sent
some
one
forth
to
obtain
tidings
for
in
sooth
twill
work
no
good
to
march
upon
the
gates
if
they
be
look
master
quoth
one
of
the
widow
s
sons
there
comes
a
palmer
along
the
road
from
the
town
belike
he
can
tell
us
how
the
land
ties
and
if
stutely
be
really
in
jeopardy
shall
i
go
out
and
engage
him
in
speech
go
answered
robin
so
stout
will
went
out
from
the
band
while
the
others
hid
themselves
and
waited
when
he
had
come
close
to
the
palmer
who
seemed
a
slight
youngish
man
he
doffed
his
hat
full
courteously
and
said
i
crave
your
pardon
holy
man
but
can
you
tell
me
tidings
of
nottingham
town
do
they
intend
to
put
an
outlaw
to
death
this
day
yea
answered
the
palmer
sadly
tis
true
enough
sorry
be
the
day
i
have
passed
the
very
spot
where
the
is
going
up
tis
out
upon
the
roadway
near
the
sheriff
s
castle
one
will
stutely
is
to
be
hung
thereon
at
noon
and
i
could
not
bear
the
sight
so
came
the
palmer
spoke
in
a
muffled
voice
and
as
his
hood
was
pulled
well
over
his
head
stout
will
could
not
discern
what
manner
of
man
he
was
over
his
shoulder
he
carried
a
long
staff
with
the
fashion
of
a
little
cross
at
one
end
and
he
had
sandaled
feet
like
any
monk
stout
will
notice
idly
that
the
feet
were
very
small
and
white
but
gave
no
second
thought
to
the
matter
who
will
shrive
the
poor
wretch
if
you
have
come
away
from
him
he
asked
reproachfully
the
question
seemed
to
put
a
new
idea
into
the
palmer
s
head
he
turned
so
quickly
that
he
almost
dropped
his
hood
do
you
think
that
i
should
undertake
this
holy
office
by
saint
peter
and
the
blessed
virgin
i
do
indeed
else
who
will
do
it
the
bishop
and
all
his
whining
clerks
may
be
there
but
not
one
would
say
a
prayer
for
his
but
i
am
only
a
poor
palmer
the
other
began
hesitatingly
nathless
your
prayers
are
as
good
as
any
and
better
than
some
replied
will
right
gladly
would
i
go
then
said
the
palmer
but
i
fear
me
i
can
not
get
into
the
city
you
may
know
that
the
gates
are
fast
locked
for
this
morning
to
all
who
would
come
in
although
they
let
any
pass
out
who
come
with
me
said
stout
will
and
my
master
will
see
that
you
pass
through
the
so
the
palmer
pulled
his
cloak
still
closer
about
him
and
was
brought
before
robin
hood
to
whom
he
told
all
he
knew
of
the
situation
he
ended
with
if
i
may
make
so
bold
i
would
not
try
to
enter
the
city
from
this
gate
as
tis
closely
guarded
since
yesterday
but
on
the
far
side
no
attack
is
looked
my
thanks
gentle
palmer
quoth
robin
your
suggestion
is
good
and
we
will
deploy
to
the
gate
upon
the
far
so
the
men
marched
silently
but
quickly
until
they
were
near
to
the
western
gate
then
asked
leave
to
go
ahead
as
a
scout
and
quietly
made
his
way
to
a
point
under
the
tower
by
the
gate
the
moat
was
dry
on
this
side
as
these
were
times
of
peace
and
arthur
was
further
favored
by
a
stout
ivy
vine
which
grew
out
from
an
upper
window
swinging
himself
up
boldly
by
means
of
this
friendly
vine
he
crept
through
the
window
and
in
a
moment
more
had
sprung
upon
the
warder
from
behind
and
gripped
him
hard
about
the
throat
the
warder
had
no
chance
to
utter
the
slightest
sound
and
soon
lay
bound
and
gagged
upon
the
floor
while
slipped
himself
into
his
uniform
and
got
hold
of
his
keys
twas
the
work
of
but
a
few
moments
more
to
open
the
gates
let
down
the
bridge
and
admit
the
rest
of
the
band
and
they
lot
inside
the
town
so
quietly
that
none
knew
of
their
coming
fortune
also
favored
them
in
the
fact
that
just
at
this
moment
the
prison
doors
had
been
opened
for
the
march
of
the
condemned
man
and
every
soldier
and
idle
lout
in
the
had
trooped
thither
to
see
him
pass
along
presently
out
came
will
stutely
with
firm
step
but
dejected
air
he
looked
eagerly
to
the
right
hand
and
to
the
left
but
saw
none
of
the
band
and
though
more
than
one
curious
face
betrayed
friendship
in
it
he
knew
there
could
be
no
aid
from
such
source
will
s
hands
were
tied
behind
his
back
he
marched
between
rows
of
soldiery
and
the
sheriff
and
the
bishop
brought
up
the
rear
on
horses
looking
mightily
puffed
up
and
important
over
the
whole
proceeding
he
would
show
these
sturdy
rebels
would
the
sheriff
whose
word
was
law
he
knew
that
the
gates
were
tightly
fastened
and
further
he
believed
that
the
outlaws
would
hardly
venture
again
within
the
walls
even
if
the
gates
were
open
and
as
he
looked
around
at
the
fivescore
archers
and
pikemen
who
lined
the
way
to
the
gallows
he
smiled
with
grim
satisfaction
seeing
that
no
help
was
nigh
the
prisoner
paused
at
the
foot
of
the
scaffold
and
spoke
in
a
firm
tone
to
the
sheriff
my
lord
sheriff
quoth
he
since
i
must
needs
die
grant
me
one
boon
for
my
noble
master
ne
er
yet
had
a
man
that
was
hanged
on
a
tree
give
me
a
sword
all
in
my
hand
and
let
me
be
unbound
and
with
thee
and
thy
men
will
i
fight
till
i
lie
dead
on
the
but
the
sheriff
would
by
no
means
listen
to
his
request
but
swore
that
he
should
be
hanged
a
shameful
death
and
not
die
by
the
sword
valiantly
o
no
no
no
the
sheriff
said
thou
shalt
on
the
gallows
die
aye
and
so
shall
they
master
too
if
ever
it
in
me
o
dastard
coward
stutely
cried
peasant
slave
if
ever
my
master
do
thee
meet
thou
shalt
thy
payment
have
my
noble
master
thee
doth
scorn
and
all
thy
cowardly
crew
such
silly
imps
unable
are
bold
robin
to
this
brave
speech
was
not
calculated
to
soothe
the
sheriff
to
the
gallows
with
him
he
roared
giving
a
sign
to
the
hangman
and
stutely
was
pushed
into
the
rude
cart
which
was
to
bear
him
under
the
gallows
until
his
neck
was
leashed
then
the
cart
would
be
drawn
roughly
away
and
the
unhappy
man
would
swing
out
over
the
tail
of
it
into
another
world
but
at
this
moment
came
a
slight
interruption
a
palmer
stepped
forth
and
said
your
excellency
let
me
at
least
shrive
this
poor
wretch
s
soul
ere
it
be
hurled
into
no
shouted
the
sheriff
let
him
die
a
dog
s
death
then
his
damnation
will
rest
upon
you
said
the
monk
firmly
you
my
lord
bishop
can
not
stand
by
and
see
this
wrong
the
bishop
hesitated
like
the
sheriff
he
wanted
no
delay
but
the
people
were
beginning
to
mutter
among
themselves
and
move
about
uneasily
he
said
a
few
words
to
the
sheriff
and
the
latter
nodded
to
the
monk
ungraciously
perform
your
duty
sir
priest
quoth
he
and
be
quick
about
it
then
turning
to
his
soldiers
watch
this
palmer
narrowly
he
commanded
belike
he
is
in
league
with
those
rascally
but
the
palmer
paid
no
heed
to
his
last
words
he
began
to
tell
his
beads
quickly
and
to
speak
in
a
low
voice
to
the
condemned
man
but
he
did
not
touch
his
bonds
then
came
another
stir
in
the
crowd
and
one
came
pushing
through
the
press
of
people
and
soldiery
to
come
near
to
the
scaffold
i
pray
you
will
before
you
die
take
leave
of
all
your
friends
cried
out
the
voice
of
much
the
miller
s
son
at
the
word
the
palmer
stepped
back
suddenly
and
looked
to
one
side
the
sheriff
also
knew
the
speaker
seize
him
he
shouted
tis
another
of
the
crew
he
is
the
villain
cook
who
once
did
rob
me
of
my
silver
plate
we
ll
make
a
double
hanging
of
this
not
so
fast
good
master
sheriff
retorted
much
first
catch
your
man
and
then
hang
him
but
meanwhile
i
would
like
to
borrow
my
friend
of
you
and
with
one
stroke
of
his
keen
he
cut
the
bonds
which
fastened
the
prisoner
s
arms
and
stutely
leaped
lightly
from
the
cart
treason
screamed
the
sheriff
getting
black
with
rage
catch
the
varlets
so
saying
he
spurred
his
horse
fiercely
forward
and
rising
in
his
stirrups
brought
down
his
sword
with
might
and
main
at
much
s
head
but
his
former
cook
dodged
nimbly
underneath
the
horse
and
came
up
on
the
other
side
while
the
weapon
whistled
harmlessly
in
the
air
nay
sir
sheriff
he
cried
i
must
e
en
borrow
your
sword
for
the
friend
i
have
thereupon
he
snatched
the
weapon
deftly
from
the
sheriff
s
hand
here
stutely
said
he
the
sheriff
has
lent
you
his
own
sword
back
to
back
with
me
man
and
we
ll
teach
these
knaves
a
trick
or
two
meanwhile
the
soldiers
had
recovered
from
their
momentary
surprise
and
had
flung
themselves
into
the
fray
a
clear
had
also
sounded
the
same
which
the
soldiers
had
learned
to
dread
twas
the
rallying
note
of
the
green
wood
men
cloth
yard
shafts
began
to
hurtle
through
the
air
and
robin
and
his
men
cast
aside
their
cloaks
and
sprang
forward
crying
lockesley
lockesley
a
rescue
a
rescue
on
the
instant
a
terrible
scene
of
hand
to
hand
fighting
followed
the
sheriff
s
men
though
once
more
taken
by
surprise
were
determined
to
sell
this
rescue
dearly
they
packed
in
closely
and
stubbornly
about
the
condemned
man
and
much
and
the
palmer
and
it
was
only
by
desperate
rushes
that
the
foresters
made
an
opening
in
the
square
ugly
cuts
and
bruises
were
exchanged
freely
and
lucky
was
the
man
who
escaped
with
only
these
many
of
the
onlookers
who
had
long
hated
the
sheriff
and
felt
sympathy
for
robin
s
men
also
plunged
into
the
conflict
although
they
could
not
well
keep
out
of
it
in
sooth
and
aided
the
rescuers
no
little
at
last
with
a
mighty
onrush
robin
cleaved
a
way
through
the
press
to
the
scaffold
itself
and
not
a
second
too
soon
for
two
men
with
pikes
had
leaped
upon
the
cart
and
were
in
the
act
of
thrusting
down
upon
the
palmer
and
will
stutely
a
mighty
upward
blow
from
robin
s
good
blade
sent
the
pike
flying
from
the
hand
of
one
while
a
arrow
from
the
outskirt
pierced
the
other
fellow
s
throat
god
save
you
master
cried
will
stutely
joyfully
i
had
begun
to
fear
that
i
would
never
see
your
face
a
rescue
shouted
the
outlaws
afresh
and
the
soldiery
became
fainthearted
and
gan
to
give
back
but
the
field
was
not
yet
won
for
they
retreated
in
close
order
toward
the
east
gate
resolved
to
hem
the
attackers
within
the
city
walls
here
again
however
they
were
in
error
since
the
outlaws
did
not
go
out
by
their
nearest
gate
they
made
a
sally
in
that
direction
in
order
to
mislead
the
soldiery
then
abruptly
turned
and
headed
for
the
west
gate
which
was
still
guarded
by
the
sheriff
s
men
raised
an
exultant
shout
at
this
thinking
they
had
the
enemy
trapped
down
they
charged
after
them
but
the
outlaws
made
good
their
lead
and
soon
got
through
the
gate
and
over
the
bridge
which
had
been
let
down
by
close
upon
their
heels
came
the
soldiers
so
close
that
arthur
had
no
time
to
close
the
gate
again
or
raise
the
bridge
so
he
threw
away
his
key
and
fell
in
with
the
yeomen
who
now
began
their
retreat
up
the
long
hill
to
the
woods
on
this
side
the
town
the
road
leading
to
the
forest
was
long
and
almost
unprotected
the
greenwood
men
were
therefore
in
some
distress
for
the
archers
shot
at
them
from
in
the
walls
and
the
pikemen
were
reinforced
by
a
company
of
mounted
men
from
the
castle
but
the
outlaws
retreated
stubbornly
and
now
and
again
turned
to
hold
their
pursuers
at
bay
by
a
volley
of
arrows
stutely
was
in
their
midst
fighting
with
the
energy
of
two
and
the
little
palmer
was
there
also
but
took
no
part
save
to
keep
close
to
robin
s
side
and
mutter
silent
words
as
though
in
prayer
robin
put
his
horn
to
his
lips
to
sound
a
rally
when
a
flying
arrow
from
the
enemy
pierced
his
hand
the
palmer
gave
a
little
cry
and
sprang
forward
the
sheriff
who
followed
close
with
the
men
on
horseback
also
saw
the
wound
and
gave
a
great
huzza
ha
you
will
shoot
no
more
bows
for
a
season
master
outlaw
he
shouted
you
lie
retorted
robin
fiercely
wrenching
the
shaft
from
his
hand
despite
the
streaming
blood
i
have
saved
one
shot
for
you
all
this
day
here
take
it
and
he
fitted
the
same
arrow
which
had
wounded
him
upon
the
string
of
his
bow
and
let
it
fly
toward
the
sheriff
s
head
the
sheriff
fell
forward
upon
his
horse
in
mortal
terror
but
not
so
quickly
as
to
escape
unhurt
the
sharp
point
laid
bare
a
deep
gash
upon
his
scalp
and
must
certainly
have
killed
him
if
it
had
come
closer
the
fall
of
the
sheriff
discomfited
his
followers
for
the
moment
and
robin
s
men
took
this
chance
to
speed
on
up
the
hill
the
palmer
had
whipped
out
a
small
white
handkerchief
and
tried
to
staunch
robin
s
wound
as
they
went
at
sight
of
the
palmer
s
hand
robin
turned
with
a
start
and
pushed
back
the
other
s
hood
marian
he
exclaimed
you
here
it
was
indeed
maid
marian
who
had
helped
save
will
and
been
in
the
stress
of
battle
from
the
first
now
she
hung
her
head
as
though
caught
in
wrong
i
had
to
come
robin
she
said
simply
and
i
knew
you
would
not
let
me
come
their
further
talk
was
interrupted
by
an
exclamation
from
will
scarlet
by
the
saints
we
are
trapped
he
said
and
pointed
to
the
top
of
the
hill
toward
which
they
were
pressing
there
from
out
a
gray
castle
poured
a
troop
of
men
armed
with
pikes
and
axes
who
shouted
and
came
running
down
upon
them
at
the
same
instant
the
sheriff
s
men
also
renewed
the
pursuit
alas
cried
poor
marian
we
are
undone
there
is
no
way
of
escape
courage
dear
heart
said
robin
drawing
her
close
to
him
but
his
own
spirit
sank
as
he
looked
about
for
some
outlet
then
oh
joyful
sight
he
recognized
among
the
foremost
of
those
coming
from
the
castle
the
once
doleful
knight
sir
richard
of
the
lea
he
was
smiling
now
and
greatly
excited
a
hood
a
hood
he
cried
a
rescue
a
rescue
never
were
there
more
welcome
sights
and
sounds
than
these
with
a
great
cheer
the
outlaws
raced
up
the
hill
to
meet
their
new
friends
and
soon
the
whole
force
had
gained
the
shelter
of
the
castle
bang
went
the
bridge
as
it
swung
back
with
great
clanking
of
chains
clash
went
one
great
door
upon
the
other
as
they
shut
in
the
outlaw
band
and
shut
out
the
sheriff
who
dashed
up
at
the
head
of
his
men
his
bandaged
face
streaked
with
blood
and
inflamed
with
rage
chapter
xxi
how
sir
richard
of

turret

curtly
my
word
is
enough
am
i
not
sheriff
of
nottingham
if
you
are
in
sooth
retorted
the
knight
you
should
know
that
you
have
no
authority
within
my
lands
unless
you
bear
the
king
s
order
in
the
meantime
go
mend
your
manners
and
sir
richard
snapped
his
fingers
and
disappeared
from
the
walls
the
sheriff
after
lingering
a
few
moments
longer
in
hope
of
further
parley
was
forced
to
withdraw
swearing
fiercely
the
king
s
order
muttered
he
that
shall
i
have
without
delay
as
well
as
this
upstart
knight
s
estates
for
king
richard
is
lately
returned
i
hear
from
the
holy
meanwhile
the
knight
had
gone
back
to
robin
hood
and
the
two
men
greeted
each
other
right
gladly
well
met
bold
robin
cried
he
taking
him
in
his
arms
well
met
indeed
the
lord
has
lately
prospered
me
and
i
was
minded
this
day
to
ride
forth
and
repay
my
debt
to
and
so
you
have
answered
robin
gaily
nay
twas
nothing
this
small
service
said
the
knight
i
meant
the
moneys
coming
to
they
have
all
been
repaid
said
robin
my
lord
of
hereford
himself
gave
them
to
the
exact
sum
asked
the
knight
the
exact
sum
answered
robin
winking
solemnly
sir
richard
smiled
but
said
no
more
at
the
time
robin
was
made
to
rest
until
dinner
should
be
served
meanwhile
a
leech
bound
up
his
hand
with
ointment
promising
him
that
he
should
soon
have
its
use
again
some
halfscore
others
of
the
yeomen
had
been
hurt
in
the
fight
but
luckily
none
of
grave
moment
they
were
all
bandaged
and
made
happy
by
bumpers
of
ale
at
dinner
sir
richard
presented
robin
to
his
wife
and
son
the
lady
was
stately
and
gracious
and
made
much
of
marian
whom
she
had
known
as
a
little
girl
and
who
was
now
clothed
more
seemly
for
a
dinner
than
in
monkish
garments
the
young
esquire
was
a
goodly
youth
and
bade
fair
to
make
as
stout
a
knight
as
his
father
the
feast
was
a
joyous
event
there
were
two
long
tables
and
two
hundred
men
sat
down
at
them
and
ate
and
drank
and
afterward
sang
songs
an
hundred
and
forty
of
these
men
wore
lincoln
green
and
called
robin
hood
their
chief
never
i
ween
had
there
been
a
more
gallant
company
at
table
in
lea
castle
that
night
the
foresters
tarried
within
the
friendly
walls
and
the
next
day
took
leave
though
sir
richard
protested
that
they
should
have
made
a
longer
stay
and
he
took
robin
aside
to
his
strong
room
and
pressed
him
again
to
take
the
four
hundred
golden
pounds
but
his
guest
was
firm
keep
the
money
for
it
is
your
own
said
robin
i
have
but
made
the
bishop
return
that
which
he
extorted
sir
richard
thanked
him
in
a
few
earnest
words
and
asked
him
and
all
his
men
to
visit
the
armory
before
they
departed
and
therein
they
saw
placed
apart
an
hundred
and
forty
stout
yew
bows
of
cunning
make
with
fine
waxen
silk
strings
and
an
hundred
and
forty
sheaves
of
arrows
every
shaft
was
a
just
ell
long
set
with
peacock
s
feathers
and
notched
with
silver
and
sir
richard
s
fair
lady
came
forward
and
with
her
own
hands
gave
each
yeoman
a
bow
and
a
sheaf
in
sooth
these
are
poor
presents
we
have
made
you
good
robin
hood
said
sir
richard
but
they
carry
with
them
a
thousand
times
their
weight
in
the
sheriff
made
good
his
threat
to
inform
the
king
forth
rode
he
to
london
town
upon
the
week
following
his
scalp
wound
having
healed
sufficiently
to
permit
him
to
travel
this
time
he
did
not
seek
out
prince
john
but
asked
audience
with
king
richard
of
the
lion
heart
himself
his
majesty
had
but
lately
returned
from
the
crusades
and
was
just
then
looking
into
the
state
of
his
kingdom
so
the
sheriff
found
ready
audience
then
to
him
the
sheriff
spoke
at
length
concerning
robin
hood
how
that
for
many
months
the
outlaws
had
defied
the
king
and
slain
the
king
s
deer
how
robin
had
gathered
about
him
the
best
archers
in
all
the
countryside
and
finally
how
the
traitorous
knight
sir
richard
of
the
lea
had
rescued
the
band
when
capture
seemed
certain
and
refused
to
deliver
them
up
to
justice
the
king
heard
him
through
with
attention
and
quoth
he
meseems
i
have
heard
of
this
same
robin
hood
and
his
men
and
also
seen
somewhat
of
their
prowess
did
not
these
same
outlaws
shoot
in
a
royal
tourney
at
finsbury
field
they
did
your
majesty
under
a
royal
in
this
speech
the
sheriff
erred
for
the
king
asked
quickly
how
came
they
last
to
the
fair
at
nottingham
by
stealth
yes
your
did
you
forbid
them
to
come
no
your
majesty
that
is
speak
out
for
the
good
of
the
shire
began
the
sheriff
again
falteringly
we
did
proclaim
an
amnesty
but
twas
because
these
men
had
proved
a
menace
now
by
my
halidom
quoth
the
king
while
his
brow
grew
black
such
treachery
would
be
unknown
in
the
camp
of
the
saracen
and
yet
we
call
ourselves
a
christian
people
the
sheriff
kept
silence
through
very
fear
and
shame
then
the
king
began
speech
again
nathless
my
lord
sheriff
we
promise
to
look
into
this
matter
those
outlaws
must
be
taught
that
there
is
but
one
king
in
england
and
that
he
stands
for
the
so
the
sheriff
was
dismissed
with
very
mixed
feelings
and
went
his
way
home
to
nottingham
town
a
fortnight
later
the
king
began
to
make
good
his
word
by
riding
with
a
small
party
of
knights
to
lea
castle
sir
richard
was
advised
of
the
cavalcade
s
approach
and
quickly
recognized
his
royal
master
in
the
tall
knight
who
rode
in
advance
hasting
to
open
wide
his
castle
gates
he
went
forth
to
meet
the
king
and
fell
on
one
knee
and
kissed
his
stirrup
for
sir
richard
also
had
been
with
the
king
to
the
holy
land
and
they
had
gone
on
many
adventurous
quests
together
the
king
bade
him
rise
and
dismounted
from
his
own
horse
to
greet
him
as
a
brother
in
arms
and
they
went
into
the
castle
while
bugles
and
trumpets
sounded
forth
joyous
welcome
in
honor
of
the
great
occasion
after
the
king
had
rested
and
supped
he
turned
upon
the
knight
and
with
grave
face
inquired
what
is
this
i
hear
about
your
castle
s
becoming
a
nest
and
harbor
for
outlaws
the
sir
richard
of
the
lea
divining
that
the
sheriff
had
been
at
the
king
s
ear
with
his
story
made
a
clean
breast
of
all
he
knew
how
that
the
outlaws
had
befriended
him
in
sore
need
as
they
had
befriended
others
and
how
that
he
had
given
them
only
knightly
protection
in
return
the
king
liked
the
story
well
for
his
own
soul
was
one
of
chivalry
and
he
asked
other
questions
about
robin
hood
and
heard
of
the
ancient
wrong
done
his
father
before
him
and
of
robin
s
own
enemies
and
of
his
manner
of
living
in
sooth
cried
king
richard
springing
up
i
must
see
this
bold
fellow
for
myself
an
you
will
entertain
my
little
company
and
be
ready
to
sally
forth
upon
the
second
day
in
quest
of
me
if
need
were
i
shall
e
en
fare
alone
into
the
greenwood
to
seek
an
adventure
with
but
of
this
adventure
you
shall
be
told
in
the
next
tale
for
i
have
already
shown
you
how
sir
richard
of
the
lea
repaid
his
debt
with
interest
chapter
xxii
how
king
richard
came
to
sherwood
forest
king
richard
hearing
of
the
pranks
of
robin
hood
and
his
men
he
much
admired
and
more
desired
to
see
both
him
and
them
then
robin
takes
a
can
of
ale
come
let
us
now
begin
and
every
man
shall
have
his
can
here
s
a
health
unto
the
king
friar
tuck
had
nursed
little
john
s
wounded
knee
so
skilfully
that
it
was
now
healed
in
sooth
the
last
part
of
the
nursing
depended
more
upon
strength
than
skill
for
it
consisted
chiefly
of
holding
down
the
patient
by
main
force
to
his
cot
little
john
had
felt
so
well
that
he
had
insisted
upon
getting
up
before
the
wound
was
healed
and
he
would
have
done
so
if
the
friar
had
not
piled
some
holy
books
upon
his
legs
and
sat
upon
his
stomach
under
this
vigorous
treatment
little
john
was
constrained
to
lie
quiet
until
the
friar
gave
him
leave
to
get
up
at
last
he
had
this
leave
and
he
and
the
friar
went
forth
to
join
the
rest
of
the
band
who
were
right
glad
to
see
them
you
may
be
sure
they
sat
around
a
big
fire
for
twas
a
chilly
evening
and
they
feasted
and
made
merry
in
great
content
a
cold
rain
set
in
later
but
the
friar
wended
his
way
back
nathless
to
his
little
hermitage
there
he
made
himself
a
cheerful
blaze
and
changed
his
dripping
robe
and
had
sat
himself
down
with
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
before
a
tankard
of
hot
mulled
wine
and
a
pasty
when
suddenly
a
voice
was
heard
on
the
outside
demanding
admission
his
kennel
of
dogs
set
up
furious
uproar
on
the
instant
by
way
of
proving
the
fact
of
a
stranger
s
presence
now
by
saint
peter
growled
the
friar
who
comes
here
at
this
unseemly
hour
does
he
take
this
for
a
hostelry
move
on
friend
else
my
mulled
wine
will
get
cold
so
saying
he
put
the
tankard
to
his
lips
when
a
thundering
rap
sounded
upon
the
making
it
to
quiver
and
causing
tuck
almost
to
drop
his
tankard
while
an
angry
voice
shouted
ho
within
there
open
i
say
go
your
way
in
peace
roared
back
the
friar
i
can
do
nothing
for
you
tis
but
a
few
miles
to
gamewell
if
you
know
the
but
i
do
not
know
the
road
and
if
i
did
i
would
not
budge
another
foot
tis
wet
without
and
dry
within
so
open
without
further
parley
a
murrain
seize
you
for
disturbing
a
holy
man
in
his
prayers
muttered
tuck
savagely
nathless
he
was
fain
to
unbar
the
door
in
order
to
keep
it
from
being
battered
down
then
lighting
a
torch
at
his
fire
and
whistling
for
one
of
his
dogs
he
strode
forth
to
see
who
his
visitor
might
be
the
figure
of
a
tall
knight
clad
in
a
black
coat
of
mail
with
plumed
helmet
stood
before
him
by
his
side
stood
his
horse
also
caparisoned
in
rich
armor
have
you
no
supper
brother
asked
the
black
knight
curtly
i
must
beg
of
you
a
bed
and
a
bit
of
roof
for
this
night
and
fain
would
refresh
my
body
ere
i
i
have
no
room
that
even
your
steed
would
deign
to
accept
sir
knight
and
naught
save
a
crust
of
bread
and
pitcher
of
i
faith
i
can
smell
better
fare
than
that
brother
and
must
e
en
force
my
company
upon
you
though
i
shall
recompense
it
for
gold
in
the
name
of
the
church
as
for
my
horse
let
him
but
be
blanketed
and
put
on
the
sheltered
side
of
the
and
without
further
parley
the
knight
boldly
strode
past
tuck
and
his
dog
and
entered
the
hermitage
something
about
his
masterful
air
pleased
tuck
in
spite
of
his
churlishness
sit
you
down
sir
knight
quoth
he
and
i
will
fasten
up
up
your
steed
and
find
him
somewhat
in
the
shape
of
grain
half
also
of
my
bed
and
board
is
yours
this
night
but
we
shall
see
later
who
is
the
better
man
and
is
to
give
the
orders
with
all
my
soul
said
the
knight
laughing
i
can
pay
my
keeping
in
blows
or
gold
as
you
the
friar
presently
returned
and
drew
up
a
small
table
near
the
fire
now
sir
knight
quoth
he
put
off
your
sword
and
helm
and
such
other
as
it
pleases
you
and
help
me
lay
this
table
for
i
am
passing
the
knight
did
as
he
was
told
and
put
aside
the
visor
which
had
hid
his
face
he
was
a
bronzed
and
bearded
man
with
blue
eyes
and
hair
shot
with
gold
haughty
but
handsome
withal
then
once
again
the
priest
sat
him
down
to
his
pasty
and
mulled
wine
right
hopefully
he
spoke
his
grace
with
some
haste
and
was
surprised
to
hear
his
guest
respond
fittingly
in
the
latin
tongue
then
they
attacked
the
wine
and
pasty
valiantly
and
the
black
knight
made
good
his
word
of
being
in
need
of
refreshment
tuck
looked
ruefully
at
the
rapidly
disappearing
food
but
came
to
grudge
it
not
by
reason
of
the
stories
with
which
his
guest
enlivened
the
meal
the
wine
and
warmth
of
the
room
had
cheered
them
both
and
they
were
soon
laughing
uproariously
as
the
best
of
comrades
in
the
world
the
black
knight
it
seemed
had
traveled
everywhere
he
had
been
on
crusades
had
fought
the
courteous
saladin
had
been
in
prison
and
often
in
peril
but
now
he
spoke
of
it
lightly
and
laughed
it
off
and
made
himself
so
friendly
that
friar
tuck
was
like
to
choke
with
merriment
so
passed
the
time
till
late
and
the
two
fell
asleep
together
one
on
each
side
of
the
table
which
had
been
cleared
to
the
platters
in
the
morning
friar
tuck
awoke
disposed
to
be
surly
but
was
speedily
mollified
by
the
sight
of
the
black
knight
who
had
already
risen
gay
as
a
lark
washed
his
face
and
hands
and
was
now
stirring
a
hot
gruel
over
the
fire
by
my
faith
i
make
a
sorry
host
cried
tuck
springing
to
his
feet
and
later
as
they
sat
at
breakfast
he
added
i
want
not
your
gold
of
which
you
spoke
last
night
but
instead
i
will
do
what
i
can
to
speed
you
on
your
way
whenever
you
wish
to
then
tell
me
said
the
knight
how
i
may
find
robin
hood
the
outlaw
for
i
have
a
message
to
him
from
the
king
all
day
yesterday
i
sought
him
but
found
him
friar
tuck
lifted
up
his
hands
in
holy
horror
i
am
a
lover
of
peace
sir
knight
and
do
not
consort
with
robin
s
bold
nay
i
think
no
harm
of
master
hood
said
the
knight
but
much
i
yearn
to
have
speed
with
him
in
mine
own
if
that
be
all
mayhap
i
can
guide
you
to
his
haunts
said
tuck
who
foresaw
in
this
knight
a
possible
for
robin
in
sooth
i
could
not
well
live
in
these
woods
without
hearing
somewhat
of
the
outlaws
but
matters
of
religion
are
my
chief
joy
and
i
will
go
with
you
brother
said
the
black
knight
so
without
more
ado
they
went
their
way
into
the
forest
the
knight
riding
upon
his
charger
and
tuck
pacing
along
demurely
by
his
side
the
day
had
dawned
clear
and
bright
and
now
with
the
sun
a
good
three
hours
high
a
sweet
autumn
fragrance
was
in
the
air
the
wind
had
just
that
touch
of
coolness
in
it
which
sets
the
hunter
s
blood
to
tingling
and
every
creature
of
nature
seemed
bounding
with
joyous
life
the
knight
sniffed
the
fresh
air
in
delight
by
my
halidom
quoth
he
but
the
good
greenwood
is
the
best
place
to
live
in
after
all
what
court
or
capital
can
equal
this
for
men
none
of
this
earth
replied
tuck
smilingly
and
once
more
his
heart
warmed
toward
the
courteous
stranger
they
had
not
proceeded
more
than
three
or
four
miles
along
the
way
from
fountain
abbey
to
barnesdale
when
of
a
sudden
the
bushes
just
ahead
of
them
parted
and
a
man
with
curling
brown
hair
stepped
into
the
road
and
laid
his
hand
upon
the
knight
s
bridle
it
was
robin
hood
he
had
seen
friar
tuck
a
little
way
back
and
shrewdly
suspected
his
plan
tuck
however
feigned
not
to
know
him
at
all
hold
cried
robin
i
am
in
charge
of
the
highway
this
day
and
must
exact
an
accounting
from
all
who
is
it
bids
me
hold
asked
the
knight
quietly
i
am
not
i
the
habit
of
yielding
to
one
then
here
are
others
to
keep
me
company
said
robin
clapping
his
hands
and
instantly
a
other
stalwart
fellows
came
out
of
the
bushes
and
stood
beside
him
we
be
yeomen
of
the
forest
sir
knight
continued
robin
and
live
under
the
greenwood
tree
we
have
no
means
of
support
thanks
to
the
tyranny
of
our
other
than
the
aid
which
fat
churchmen
and
goodly
knights
like
yourselves
can
give
and
as
ye
have
churches
and
rents
both
and
gold
in
great
plenty
we
beseech
ye
for
saint
charity
to
give
us
some
of
your
i
am
but
a
poor
monk
good
sir
said
friar
tuck
in
a
whining
voice
and
am
on
my
way
to
the
shrine
of
saint
dunstan
if
your
worshipfulness
will
tarry
a
space
with
us
answered
robin
biting
back
a
smile
and
we
will
speed
you
on
your
the
black
knight
now
spoke
again
but
we
are
messengers
of
the
king
quoth
he
his
majesty
himself
tarries
near
here
and
would
have
speech
with
robin
god
save
the
king
said
robin
doffing
his
cap
loyally
and
all
that
wish
him
well
i
am
robin
hood
but
i
say
cursed
be
the
man
who
denies
our
liege
king
s
sovereignty
have
a
care
said
the
knight
or
you
shall
curse
yourself
nay
not
so
replied
robin
curtly
the
king
has
no
more
devoted
subject
than
i
nor
have
i
despoiled
aught
of
his
save
mayhap
a
few
deer
for
my
hunger
my
chief
war
is
against
the
clergy
and
barons
of
the
land
who
bear
down
upon
the
poor
but
i
am
glad
he
continued
that
i
have
met
you
here
and
before
we
end
you
shall
be
my
friend
and
taste
of
our
greenwood
but
what
is
the
reckoning
asked
the
knight
for
i
am
told
that
some
of
your
feasts
are
nay
responded
robin
waving
his
hands
you
are
from
the
king
nathless
how
much
money
is
in
your
purse
i
have
no
more
than
forty
gold
pieces
seeing
that
i
have
lain
a
fortnight
at
nottingham
with
the
king
and
have
spent
some
goodly
amounts
upon
other
lordings
replied
the
knight
robin
took
the
forty
pounds
and
gravely
counted
it
one
half
he
gave
to
his
men
and
bade
them
drink
the
king
s
health
with
it
the
other
half
he
handed
back
to
the
knight
sir
said
he
courteously
have
this
for
your
spending
if
you
lie
with
kings
and
lordings
overmuch
you
are
like
to
need
gramercy
replied
the
other
smiling
and
now
lead
on
to
your
greenwood
so
robin
went
on
the
one
side
of
the
knight
s
steed
and
friar
tuck
on
the
other
and
the
men
went
before
and
behind
till
they
came
to
the
open
glade
before
the
caves
of
barnesdale
then
robin
drew
forth
his
bugle
and
winded
the
three
signal
blasts
of
the
band
soon
there
came
a
company
of
yeomen
with
its
leader
and
another
and
a
third
and
a
fourth
till
there
were
sevenscore
yeomen
in
sight
all
were
dressed
in
new
livery
of
lincoln
green
and
carried
new
bows
in
their
hands
and
bright
short
swords
at
their
belts
and
every
man
bent
his
knee
to
robin
hood
ere
taking
his
place
before
the
board
which
was
already
set
a
handsome
page
stood
at
robin
s
right
hand
to
pour
his
wine
and
that
of
the
knightly
guest
while
the
knight
marveled
much
at
all
he
saw
and
said
within
himself
these
men
of
robin
hood
s
give
him
more
obedience
than
my
fellows
give
to
at
the
signal
from
robin
the
dinner
began
there
was
venison
and
fowl
and
fish
and
wheaten
cake
and
ale
and
red
wine
in
great
plenty
and
twas
a
goodly
sight
to
see
the
smiles
upon
the
hungry
yeomen
s
faces
first
they
listened
to
an
unctuous
grace
from
friar
tuck
and
then
robin
lifted
high
a
tankard
of
ale
come
let
us
now
begin
quoth
he
and
every
man
shall
have
his
can
in
honor
of
our
guest
who
comes
with
royal
word
here
s
a
health
unto
the
king
the
guest
responded
heartily
to
this
toast
and
round
about
the
board
it
went
the
men
cheering
noisily
for
king
richard
after
the
feast
was
over
robin
turned
to
his
guest
and
said
now
you
shall
see
what
life
we
lead
so
that
you
may
report
faithfully
for
good
or
bad
unto
the
so
at
a
signal
from
him
the
men
rose
up
and
smartly
bent
their
bows
for
practice
while
the
knight
was
greatly
astonished
at
the
smallness
of
the
their
targets
a
wand
was
set
up
far
down
the
glade
and
thereon
was
balanced
a
garland
of
roses
whosoever
failed
to
speed
his
shaft
through
the
garland
without
knocking
it
off
the
wand
was
to
submit
to
a
buffet
from
the
hand
of
friar
tuck
ho
ho
cried
the
knight
as
his
late
traveling
companion
rose
up
and
bared
his
brawny
arm
ready
for
service
so
you
my
friend
are
friar
tuck
i
have
not
gainsaid
it
replied
tuck
growling
at
having
betrayed
himself
but
chastisement
is
a
rule
of
the
church
and
i
am
seeking
the
good
of
these
stray
the
knight
said
no
more
though
his
eyes
twinkled
and
the
shooting
began
david
of
doncaster
shot
first
and
landed
safely
through
the
rose
garland
then
came
and
little
john
and
stutely
and
scarlet
and
many
of
the
rest
while
the
knight
held
his
breath
from
very
amazement
each
fellow
shot
truly
through
the
garland
until
middle
the
tinker
not
to
be
outdone
stepped
up
for
a
trial
but
alas
while
he
made
a
fair
shot
for
a
townsman
the
arrow
never
came
within
a
of
the
outer
rim
of
the
garland
come
hither
fellow
said
little
john
coaxingly
the
priest
would
bless
thee
with
his
open
then
because
middle
made
a
wry
face
as
though
he
had
already
received
the
buffet
and
loitered
in
his
steps
and
will
stutely
seized
him
by
the
arms
and
stood
him
before
the
friar
tuck
s
big
arm
flashed
through
the
air
whoof
and
stopped
suddenly
against
the
tinker
s
ear
while
middle
himself
went
rolling
over
and
over
on
the
grass
he
was
stopped
by
a
small
bush
and
up
he
sat
thrusting
his
head
through
it
rubbing
his
ear
and
blinking
up
at
the
sky
as
though
the
stars
had
fallen
and
struck
him
the
yeomen
roared
with
merriment
and
as
for
the
knight
he
laughed
till
the
tears
came
out
of
his
blue
eyes
and
rolled
down
his
face
after
middle
s
mishap
others
of
the
band
seemed
to
lose
their
balance
and
fared
in
the
same
fashion
the
garland
would
topple
over
in
a
most
impish
way
at
every
breath
although
the
arrows
went
through
it
so
middle
gan
to
feel
better
when
he
saw
this
one
and
that
one
tumbling
on
the
sward
at
last
came
robin
s
turn
he
shot
carefully
but
as
ill
luck
would
have
it
the
shaft
was
and
swerved
sidewise
so
that
it
missed
the
garland
by
full
three
fingers
then
a
great
roar
went
up
from
the
whole
company
for
twas
rare
that
they
saw
their
leader
miss
his
mark
robin
flung
his
bow
upon
the
ground
from
very
vexation
a
murrain
take
it
quoth
he
the
arrow
was
sadly
winged
i
felt
the
poor
feather
upon
it
as
it
left
my
fingers
then
suddenly
seizing
his
bow
again
he
sped
three
shafts
as
fast
as
he
could
sent
them
and
every
one
went
clean
through
the
garland
by
saint
george
muttered
the
knight
never
before
saw
i
such
shooting
in
all
christendom
the
band
cheered
heartily
at
these
last
shots
but
will
scarlet
came
up
gravely
to
robin
pretty
shooting
master
quoth
he
but
twill
not
save
you
from
paying
for
the
bad
arrow
so
walk
up
and
take
your
medicine
nay
that
may
not
be
protested
robin
the
good
friar
belongs
to
my
company
and
has
no
authority
to
lift
hands
against
me
but
you
sir
knight
stand
as
it
were
for
the
king
i
pray
you
serve
out
my
not
so
said
friar
tuck
my
son
you
forget
i
stand
for
the
church
which
is
greater
even
than
the
not
in
merry
england
said
the
knight
in
a
deep
voice
then
rising
to
his
feet
he
added
i
stand
ready
to
serve
you
master
now
out
upon
ye
for
an
upstart
knight
cried
friar
tuck
i
told
you
last
night
sirrah
that
we
should
yet
see
who
was
the
better
man
so
we
will
e
en
prove
it
now
and
thus
settle
who
is
to
pay
robin
good
said
robin
for
i
want
not
to
start
a
dispute
between
church
and
good
also
said
the
knight
tis
an
easy
way
to
end
prattling
come
friar
strike
and
ye
dare
i
will
give
you
first
you
have
the
advantage
of
an
iron
pot
on
your
head
and
gloves
on
your
hands
said
the
friar
but
have
at
ye
down
you
shall
go
if
you
were
goliath
of
once
more
the
priest
s
brawny
arm
flashed
through
the
air
and
struck
with
a
whoof
but
to
the
amazement
of
all
the
knight
did
not
budge
from
his
tracks
though
the
upper
half
of
his
body
swerved
slightly
to
ease
the
force
of
the
blow
a
loud
shout
burst
from
the
yeomen
at
this
for
the
friar
s
fist
was
proverbial
and
few
of
those
present
had
not
felt
the
force
of
it
in
times
past
now
tis
my
turn
said
his
antagonist
coolly
casting
aside
his
gauntlet
and
with
one
blow
of
his
fist
the
knight
sent
the
friar
spinning
to
the
ground
if
there
had
been
uproar
and
shouting
before
it
was
as
naught
to
the
noise
which
now
broke
forth
every
fellow
held
his
sides
or
rolled
upon
the
ground
from
laughter
every
fellow
save
one
and
that
was
robin
hood
out
of
the
into
the
fire
thought
he
i
wish
i
had
let
the
friar
box
my
ears
after
all
robin
s
plight
did
indeed
seem
a
sorry
one
before
the
steel
muscles
of
his
stranger
but
he
was
saved
from
a
tumble
heels
over
head
by
an
diversion
a
horn
winded
in
the
glade
and
a
party
of
knights
were
seen
approaching
to
your
arms
cried
robin
hurriedly
seizing
his
sword
and
bow
tis
sir
richard
of
the
lea
cried
another
as
the
troop
came
nearer
and
so
it
was
sir
richard
spurred
forward
his
horse
and
dashed
up
to
the
camp
while
the
outlaws
stood
at
stiff
attention
when
he
had
come
near
the
spot
where
the
black
knight
stood
he
dismounted
and
knelt
before
him
i
trust
your
majesty
has
not
needed
our
arms
before
he
said
humbly
it
is
the
king
cried
will
scarlet
falling
upon
his
knees
the
king
echoed
robin
hood
after
a
moment
of
dumb
wonderment
and
he
and
all
his
men
bent
reverently
upon
their
knees
as
one
man
chapter
xxiii
how
robin
hood
and
maid
marian
were
wed
stand
up
again
then
said
the
king
i
ll
thee
thy
pardon
give
stand
up
my
friend
who
can
contend
when
i
give
leave
to
live
then
robin
hood
began
a
health
to
marian
his
only
dear
and
his
yeomen
all
both
comely
and
tall
did
quickly
bring
up
the
rear
your
pardon
sire
exclaimed
robin
hood
pardon
from
your
royal
bounty
for
these
my
men
who
stand
ready
to
serve
you
all
your
days
richard
of
the
lion
heart
looked
grimly
about
over
the
kneeling
band
is
it
as
your
leader
says
he
asked
aye
my
lord
king
burst
from
sevenscore
throats
at
once
we
be
not
outlaws
from
choice
alone
continued
robin
but
have
been
driven
to
outlawry
through
oppression
grant
us
grace
and
royal
protection
and
we
will
forsake
the
greenwood
and
follow
the
richard
s
eyes
sparkled
as
he
looked
from
one
to
another
of
this
stalwart
band
and
he
thought
within
himself
that
here
indeed
was
a
royal
bodyguard
worth
the
while
swear
he
said
in
his
full
rich
voice
swear
that
you
robin
hood
and
all
your
men
from
this
day
henceforth
will
serve
the
king
we
swear
came
once
more
the
answering
shout
from
the
yeomen
arise
then
said
king
richard
i
give
you
all
free
pardon
and
will
speedily
put
your
service
to
the
test
for
i
love
such
archers
as
you
have
shown
yourselves
to
be
and
it
were
a
sad
pity
to
decree
such
men
to
death
england
could
not
produce
the
like
again
for
many
a
day
but
in
sooth
i
can
not
allow
you
to
roam
in
the
forest
and
shoot
my
deer
nor
to
take
the
law
of
the
land
into
your
own
hands
therefore
i
now
appoint
you
to
be
royal
archers
and
mine
own
especial
there
be
one
or
two
civil
matters
to
settle
with
certain
norman
noblemen
in
which
i
crave
your
aid
thereafter
the
half
of
your
number
as
may
later
be
determined
shall
come
back
to
these
woodlands
as
royal
foresters
mayhap
you
will
show
as
much
zeal
in
protecting
my
preserves
as
you
have
formerly
shown
in
hunting
them
where
now
is
that
outlaw
known
as
little
john
stand
forth
here
sire
quoth
the
giant
doffing
his
cap
good
master
little
john
said
the
king
looking
him
over
approvingly
could
your
weak
sinews
stand
the
strain
of
an
office
in
the
shire
if
so
you
are
this
day
sheriff
of
nottingham
and
i
trust
you
will
make
a
better
official
than
the
man
you
i
shall
do
my
best
sire
said
little
john
great
astonishment
and
gladness
in
his
heart
master
scarlet
stand
forth
said
the
king
and
then
addressing
him
i
have
heard
somewhat
of
your
tale
quoth
he
and
that
your
father
was
the
friend
of
my
father
now
therefore
accept
the
royal
pardon
and
resume
the
care
of
your
family
estates
for
your
father
must
be
growing
old
and
come
you
to
london
next
court
day
and
we
shall
see
if
there
be
a
knighthood
likewise
the
king
called
for
will
stutely
and
made
him
chief
of
the
royal
archers
then
he
summoned
friar
tuck
to
draw
near
i
crave
my
king
s
pardon
said
the
priest
humbly
enough
for
who
am
i
to
lift
my
hand
against
the
lord
s
anointed
nay
the
lord
sent
the
smiter
to
thee
without
delay
returned
richard
smiling
and
tis
not
for
me
to
continue
a
quarrel
between
church
and
state
so
what
can
i
do
for
you
in
payment
of
last
night
s
hospitality
can
i
find
some
fat
living
where
there
are
no
wicked
to
chastise
and
where
the
work
is
easy
and
comfortable
not
so
my
lord
replied
tuck
i
wish
only
for
peace
in
this
life
mine
is
a
simple
nature
and
i
care
not
for
the
fripperies
and
follies
of
court
life
give
me
a
good
meal
and
a
cup
of
right
brew
health
and
enough
for
the
day
and
i
ask
no
richard
sighed
you
ask
the
greatest
thing
in
the
world
brother
contentment
it
is
not
mine
to
give
or
to
deny
but
ask
your
god
for
it
an
if
belike
he
grant
it
then
ask
it
also
in
behalf
of
your
he
glanced
around
once
more
at
the
foresters
which
one
of
you
is
he
asked
and
allan
came
forward
so
said
the
king
with
sober
face
you
are
that
errant
minstrel
who
stole
a
bride
at
plympton
despite
her
groom
and
attending
bishop
i
heard
something
of
this
in
former
days
now
what
excuse
have
you
to
make
only
that
i
loved
her
sire
and
she
loved
me
said
allan
simply
and
the
norman
lord
would
have
married
her
perforce
because
of
her
which
have
since
been
forfeited
by
the
bishop
of
hereford
added
richard
but
my
lord
bishop
must
disgorge
them
and
from
tomorrow
you
and
mistress

to
return
to
them
and
live
in
peace
and
loyalty
and
if
ever
i
need
your
harp
at
court
stand
ready
to
attend
me
and
bring
also
the
lady
speaking
of
ladies
he
continued
turning
to
robin
hood
who
had
stood
silent
wondering
if
a
special
punishment
was
being
reserved
for
him
did
you
not
have
a
sweetheart
who
was
once
at
court
one
mistress
marian
what
has
become
of
her
that
you
should
have
forgotten
her
nay
your
majesty
said
the
page
coming
forward
blushingly
robin
has
not
forgotten
me
so
said
the
king
bending
to
kiss
her
small
hand
in
all
gallantry
verily
as
i
have
already
thought
within
myself
this
master
hood
is
better
served
than
the
king
in
his
palace
but
are
you
not
the
only
child
of
the
late
earl
of
huntingdon
i
am
sire
though
there
be
some
who
say
that
robin
hood
s
father
was
formerly
the
rightful
earl
of
huntingdon
nathless
neither
he
is
advantaged
nor
i
for
the
estates
are
then
they
shall
be
restored
forthwith
cried
the
king
and
lest
you
two
should
revive
the
ancient
quarrel
over
them
i
bestow
them
upon
you
jointly
come
forward
robin
robin
came
and
knelt
before
his
king
richard
drew
his
sword
and
touched
him
upon
the
shoulder
rise
robin
fitzooth
earl
of
huntingdon
he
exclaimed
while
a
mighty
cheer
arose
from
the
band
and
rent
the
air
of
the
forest
the
first
command
i
give
you
my
lord
earl
continued
the
king
when
quiet
was
restored
is
to
marry
mistress
marian
without
may
i
obey
all
your
majesty
s
commands
as
willingly
cried
the
new
earl
of
huntingdon
drawing
the
old
earl
s
daughter
close
to
him
the
ceremony
shall
take
place
an
this
maid
is
she
makes
little
protest
said
the
king
so
i
shall
e
en
give
away
the
bride
myself
then
the
king
chatted
with
others
of
the
foresters
and
made
himself
as
one
of
them
for
the
evening
rejoicing
that
he
could
have
this
careless
freedom
of
the
woods
and
much
the
miller
s
son
and
and
middle
and
stutely
and
scarlet
and
little
john
and
others
played
at
the
giving
and
getting
many
lusty
blows
then
as
the
shades
of
night
drew
on
the
whole
company
knights
and
foresters
supped
and
drank
around
a
blazing
fire
while
allen
sang
sweetly
to
the
thrumming
of
the
harp
and
the
others
joined
in
the
chorus
twas
a
happy
night
this
last
one
together
under
the
greenwood
tree
robin
could
not
help
feeling
an
undertone
of
sadness
that
it
was
to
be
the
last
for
the
charm
of
the
woodland
was
still
upon
him
but
he
knew
twas
better
so
and
that
the
new
life
with
marian
and
in
the
service
of
his
king
would
bring
its
own
joys
then
the
night
deepened
the
fire
sank
but
was
replenished
and
the
company
lay
down
to
rest
the
king
at
his
own
request
spent
the
night
in
the
open
thus
they
slept
king
and
subject
alike
out
under
the
stars
cared
for
lovingly
by
nature
kind
mother
of
us
all
in
the
morning
the
company
was
early
astir
and
on
their
way
to
nottingham
it
was
a
goodly
cavalcade
first
rode
king
richard
of
the
lion
heart
with
his
tall
figure
set
forth
by
the
black
armor
and
waving
plume
in
his
helm
then
came
sir
richard
of
the
lea
with
fourscore
knights
and
and
after
them
came
robin
hood
and
maid
marian
riding
upon
steeds
also
escorted
mistress
dale
on
horseback
for
she
was
to
be
at
the
wedding
these
were
followed
by
sevenscore
archers
clad
in
their
bravest
lincoln
green
and
with
their
new
bows
unstrung
in
token
of
peace
outside
the
gates
of
nottingham
town
they
were
halted
who
comes
here
asked
the
warder
s
surly
voice
open
to
the
king
of
england
came
back
the
clear
answer
and
the
gates
were
opened
and
the
bridge
let
down
without
delay
almost
before
the
company
had
crossed
the
moat
the
news
spread
through
the
town
like
wildfire
the
king
is
here
the
king
is
here
and
hath
taken
robin
hood
from
every
corner
flocked
the
people
to
see
the
company
pass
and
wildly
did
they
cheer
for
the
king
who
rode
smilingly
with
bared
head
down
through
the
at
the
far
end
of
it
he
was
met
by
the
sheriff
who
came
up
puffing
in
his
haste
to
do
the
king
honor
he
fairly
turned
green
with
rage
when
he
saw
sir
richard
of
the
lea
and
robin
hood
in
the
royal
company
but
made
low
obeisance
to
his
master
sir
sheriff
quoth
the
king
i
have
come
to
rid
the
shire
of
outlaws
according
to
my
promise
there
be
none
left
for
all
have
now
taken
service
with
their
king
and
lest
there
should
be
further
outbreak
i
have
determined
to
place
in
charge
of
this
shire
a
man
who
fears
no
other
man
in
it
master
little
john
is
hereby
created
sheriff
of
nottingham
and
you
will
turn
over
the
keys
to
him
the
sheriff
bowed
but
dared
utter
no
word
then
the
king
turned
to
the
bishop
of
hereford
who
had
also
come
up
to
pay
his
respects
harkee
my
lord
bishop
quoth
he
the
stench
of
your
evil
actions
had
reached
our
nostrils
we
shall
demand
strict
accounting
for
certain
seizures
of
the
lands
and
certain
acts
of
oppression
which
ill
become
a
churchman
but
of
this
later
this
afternoon
you
must
officiate
at
the
wedding
of
two
of
our
company
in
nottingham
church
so
make
you
the
bishop
also
bowed
and
departed
glad
to
escape
a
severer
censure
for
the
time
the
company
then
rode
on
to
the
mansion
house
where
the
king
held
high
levee
through
all
the
noon
hours
and
the
whole
town
made
a
holiday
in
the
afternoon
the
way
from
the
mansion
house
to
nottingham
church
was
lined
with
cheering
people
as
the
wedding
party
passed
by
the
famous
bowmen
were
gazed
at
as
curiously
as
though
they
had
been
wild
animals
but
were
cheered
none
the
less
robin
who
had
long
been
held
in
secret
liking
was
now
doubly
popular
since
he
had
the
king
s
favor
along
the
way
ahead
of
the
king
and
the
smiling
bride
and
groom
to
be
ran
little
maids
strewing
flowers
while
streamers
floated
in
greeting
from
the
windows
i
ween
the
only
hearts
that
were
not
glad
this
day
were
those
of
the
old
sheriff
and
of
his
proud
daughter
who
peered
between
the
shutters
of
her
window
and
was
like
to
eat
out
her
heart
from
envy
and
hatred
at
last
the
party
reached
the
church
where
the
king
dismounted
lightly
from
his
horse
and
helped
the
bride
to
alight
while
will
scarlet
the
best
man
assisted
mistress
dale
within
the
church
they
found
the
bishop
robed
in
state
and
by
his
side
friar
tuck
who
had
been
especially
deputed
to
assist
the
service
was
said
in
latin
while
the
organ
pealed
forth
softly
the
king
gave
away
the
bride
as
he
had
said
and
afterwards
claimed
first
kiss
for
his
pains
then
the
happy
party
dispersed
and
robin
and
marian
passed
out
again
through
the
portal
man
and
wife
out
through
the
cheering
streets
they
fared
while
the
greenwood
men
ran
ahead
and
flung
gold
pennies
right
and
left
in
their
joy
and
bade
the
people
drink
the
health
of
the
young
couple
and
the
king
then
the
whole
party
took
horse
at
will
scarlet
s
earnest
wish
and
went
down
to
gamewell
lodge
where
the
old
squire
george
wept
for
joy
at
seeing
his
son
and
the
king
and
the
wedding
party
that
night
they
spent
there
and
feasted
and
the
next
day
sir
richard
of
the
lea
claimed
them
and
thus
amid
feasting
and
rejoicing
and
kingly
favor
robin
hood
the
new
earl
of
huntingdon
and
his
bride
began
their
wedded
life
chapter
xxiv
how
robin
hood
met
his
death
give
me
my
bent
bow
in
my
hand
and
a
broad
arrow
i
ll
let
flee
and
where
this
arrow
is
taken
up
there
shall
my
grave
digg
d
now
by
good
rights
this
story
should
end
with
the
wedding
of
robin
hood
and
maid
marian
for
do
not
many
pleasant
tales
end
with
a
wedding
and
the
saying
and
they
lived
happy
ever
but
this
is
a
true
account
in
so
far
as
we
can
find
the
quaint
old
ballads
which
tell
of
it
and
so
we
must
follow
one
more
of
these
songs
and
learn
how
robin
after
living
many
years
longer
at
last
came
to
seek
his
grave
and
the
story
of
it
runs
in
this
wise
robin
hood
and
his
men
now
the
royal
archers
went
with
king
richard
of
the
lion
heart
through
england
settling
certain
private
disputes
which
had
arisen
among
the
norman
barons
while
the
king
was
gone
to
the
holy
land
then
the
king
proceeded
amid
great
pomp
and
rejoicing
to
the
palace
at
london
and
robin
the
new
earl
of
huntingdon
brought
his
countess
thither
where
she
became
one
of
the
finest
ladies
of
the
court
the
royal
archers
were
now
divided
into
two
bands
and
of
them
were
retained
in
london
while
the
other
half
returned
to
sherwood
and
barnesdale
there
to
guard
the
king
s
preserves
several
months
passed
by
and
robin
began
to
chafe
under
the
restraint
of
city
life
he
longed
for
the
fresh
pure
air
of
the
greenwood
and
the
rollicking
society
of
his
yeomen
one
day
upon
seeing
some
lads
at
archery
practice
upon
a
green
he
could
not
help
but
lament
saying
woe
is
me
i
fear
my
hand
is
fast
losing
its
old
time
cunning
at
the
finally
he
became
so
distraught
that
he
asked
leave
to
travel
in
foreign
lands
and
this
was
granted
him
he
took
maid
marian
with
him
and
together
they
went
through
many
strange
countries
finally
in
an
eastern
land
a
great
grief
came
upon
robin
marian
sickened
of
a
plague
and
died
they
had
been
married
but
five
years
and
robin
felt
as
though
all
the
light
had
gone
out
of
his
life
he
wandered
about
the
world
for
a
few
months
longer
trying
to
forget
his
grief
then
came
back
to
the
court
at
london
and
sought
some
commission
in
active
service
but
unluckily
richard
was
gone
again
upon
his
adventures
and
prince
john
who
acted
as
regent
had
never
been
fond
of
robin
he
received
him
with
a
sarcastic
smile
go
forth
into
the
greenwood
said
he
coldly
and
kill
some
more
of
the
king
s
deer
belike
then
the
king
will
make
you
prime
minister
at
the
very
least
upon
his
the
taunt
fired
robin
s
blood
he
had
been
in
a
morose
mood
ever
since
his
dear
wife
s
death
he
answered
prince
john
hotly
and
the
prince
bade
his
guards
seize
him
and
cast
him
into
the
tower
after
lying
there
for
a
few
weeks
he
was
released
by
the
faithful
stutely
and
the
remnant
of
the
royal
archers
and
all
together
they
fled
the
city
and
made
their
way
to
the
greenwood
there
robin
blew
the
old
familiar
call
which
all
had
known
and
loved
so
well
up
came
running
the
remainder
of
the
band
who
had
been
royal
foresters
and
when
they
saw
their
old
master
they
embraced
his
knees
and
kissed
his
hands
and
fairly
cried
for
joy
that
he
had
come
again
to
them
and
one
and
all
forswore
fealty
to
prince
john
and
lived
quietly
with
robin
in
the
greenwood
doing
harm
to
none
and
only
awaiting
the
time
when
king
richard
should
come
again
but
king
richard
came
not
again
and
would
never
need
his
royal
guard
more
tidings
presently
reached
them
of
how
he
had
met
his
death
in
a
foreign
land
and
how
john
reigned
as
king
in
his
stead
the
proof
of
these
events
followed
soon
after
when
there
came
striding
through
the
glade
the
big
familiar
form
of
little
john
art
come
to
arrest
us
called
out
robin
as
he
ran
forward
and
embraced
his
old
comrade
nay
i
am
not
come
as
the
sheriff
of
nottingham
thanks
be
answered
little
john
the
new
king
has
deposed
me
and
tis
greatly
to
my
liking
for
i
have
long
desired
to
join
you
here
again
in
the
then
were
the
rest
of
the
band
right
glad
at
this
news
and
toasted
little
john
royally
the
new
king
waged
fierce
war
upon
the
outlaws
soon
after
this
and
sent
so
many
scouting
parties
into
sherwood
and
barnesdale
that
robin
and
his
men
left
these
woods
for
a
time
and
went
into
derbyshire
near
haddon
hall
a
curious
pile
of
stone
is
shown
to
this
day
as
the
ruins
of
robin
s
castle
where
the
bold
outlaw
is
believed
to
have
defied
his
enemies
for
a
year
or
more
at
any
rate
king
john
found
so
many
troubles
of
his
own
after
a
time
that
he
ceased
troubling
the
outlaws
but
in
one
of
the
last
sorties
robin
was
wounded
the
cut
did
not
seem
serious
and
healed
over
the
top
but
it
left
a
lurking
fever
daily
his
strength
ebbed
away
from
him
until
he
was
in
sore
distress
one
day
as
he
rode
along
on
horseback
near
kirklees
abbey
he
was
seized
with
so
violent
a
rush
of
blood
to
the
head
that
he
reeled
and
came
near
falling
from
his
saddle
he
dismounted
weakly
and
knocked
at
the
abbey
gate
a
woman
shrouded
in
black
peered
forth
who
are
you
that
knock
here
for
we
allow
no
man
within
these
walls
she
said
open
for
the
love
of
heaven
he
begged
i
am
robin
hood
ill
of
a
fever
and
in
sore
at
the
name
of
robin
hood
the
woman
started
back
and
then
as
though
bethinking
herself
unbarred
the
door
and
admitted
him
assisting
his
fainting
frame
up
a
flight
of
stairs
and
into
a
front
room
she
loosed
his
collar
and
bathed
his
face
until
he
was
revived
then
she
spoke
hurriedly
in
a
low
voice
your
fever
will
sink
if
you
are
bled
see
i
have
provided
a
lancet
and
will
open
your
veins
while
you
lie
so
she
bled
him
and
he
fell
into
a
stupor
which
lasted
nearly
all
that
day
so
that
he
awoke
weak
and
exhausted
from
loss
of
blood
now
there
is
a
dispute
as
to
this
abbess
who
bled
him
some
say
that
she
did
it
in
all
kindness
of
heart
while
others
aver
that
she
was
none
other
than
the
former
sheriff
s
daughter
and
found
her
revenge
at
last
in
this
cruel
deed
be
that
as
it
may
robin
s
eyes
swam
from
very
weakness
when
he
awoke
he
called
wearily
for
help
but
there
was
no
response
he
looked
longingly
through
the
window
at
the
green
of
the
forest
but
he
was
too
weak
to
make
the
leap
that
would
be
needed
to
reach
the
ground
he
then
bethought
him
of
his
horn
which
hung
down
at
his
knee
he
set
his
horn
unto
his
mouth
and
blew
out
weak
blasts
three
little
john
was
out
in
the
forest
near
by
or
the
blasts
would
never
have
been
heard
at
their
sound
he
sprang
to
his
feet
woe
woe
he
cried
i
fear
my
master
is
near
dead
he
blows
so
wearily
so
he
made
haste
and
came
running
up
to
the
door
of
the
abbey
and
knocked
loudly
for
admittance
failing
to
get
reply
he
burst
in
the
door
with
frenzied
blows
of
his
mighty
fist
and
soon
came
running
up
to
the
room
where
robin
lay
white
and
faint
alas
dear
master
cried
little
john
in
great
distress
i
fear
you
have
met
with
treachery
if
that
be
so
grant
me
one
last
boon
i
what
is
it
asked
robin
let
me
burn
with
fire
and
all
its
nay
good
comrade
answered
robin
hood
gently
i
can
not
grant
such
a
boon
the
dear
christ
bade
us
forgive
all
our
enemies
moreover
you
know
i
never
hurt
woman
in
all
my
life
nor
man
when
in
woman
s
he
closed
his
eyes
and
fell
back
so
that
his
friend
thought
him
dying
the
great
tears
fell
from
the
giant
s
eyes
and
wet
his
master
s
hand
robin
slowly
rallied
and
seized
his
comrade
s
outstretched
arm
lift
me
up
good
little
john
he
said
brokenly
i
want
to
smell
the
air
from
the
good
greenwood
once
again
give
me
my
good
yew
bow
here
fix
a
broad
arrow
upon
the
string
out
yonder
among
the
oaks
where
this
arrow
shall
fall
let
them
dig
my
and
with
one
last
mighty
effort
he
sped
his
shaft
out
of
the
open
window
straight
and
true
as
in
the
days
of
old
till
it
struck
the
largest
oak
of
them
all
and
dropped
in
the
shadow
of
the
trees
then
he
fell
back
upon
the
sobbing
breast
of
his
devoted
friend
tis
the
last
he
murmured
tell
the
brave
hearts
to
lay
me
there
with
the
green
sod
under
my
head
and
feet
and
let
them
lay
my
bent
bow
at
my
side
for
it
has
made
sweet
music
in
mine
he
rested
a
moment
and
little
john
scarce
knew
that
he
was
alive
but
on
a
sudden
robin
s
eye
brightened
and
he
seemed
to
think
himself
back
once
more
with
the
band
in
the
open
forest
glade
he
struggled
to
rise
ha
tis
a
fine
stag
will
and
allan
thou
never
didst
thrum
the
harp
more
sweetly
how
the
light
blazes
and
marian
tis
my
marian
come
at
last
so
died
the
body
of
robin
hood
but
his
spirit
lives
on
through
the
centuries
in
the
deathless
ballads
which
are
sung
of
him
and
in
the
hearts
of
men
who
love
freedom
and
chivalry
they
buried
him
where
his
last
arrow
had
fallen
and
they
set
a
stone
to
mark
the
spot
and
on
the
stone
were
graven
these
words
here
underneath
his
little
stone
lies
robert
earl
of
huntingdon
never
archer
as
he
so
good
and
people
called
him
robin
hood
such
outlaws
as
he
and
his
men
will
england
never
see
again
