not

i

resolutions
on
this
wintry
day
cold
and
sunny
the
small
town
breathed
hard
in
its
excitement
it
might
have
climbed
rapidly
from
a
lower
land
so
heightened
now
were
its
pulses
so
light
and
rare
the
air
it
drank
so
raised
its
mood
so
wide
so
very
wide
the
opening
prospect
old
houses
old
gardens
old
high
leafless
trees
out
it
looked
from
its
place
between
the
mountain
ranges
its
point
of
view
its
position
in
space
had
each
its
value
whether
a
lesser
value
or
a
greater
value
than
other
points
and
positions
only
the
judge
of
all
can
determine
the
little
town
tried
to
see
clearly
and
to
act
rightly
if
in
this
time
so
troubled
so
obscured
by
mounting
clouds
so
tossed
by
winds
of
passion
and
of
prejudice
it
felt
the
proudest
assurance
that
it
was
doing
both
at
least
that
was
shared
all
around
the
compass
the
town
was
the
red
brick
and
white
pillars
set
on
rising
ground
and
encircled
by
trees
the
court
house
rose
like
a
guidon
planted
there
by
english
stock
around
it
gathered
a
great
crowd
breathlessly
listening
it
listened
to
the
reading
of
the
botetourt
resolutions
offered
by
the
president
of
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
and
now
delivered
in
a
solemn
and
a
ringing
voice
the
season
was
december
and
the
year
people
of
botetourt
county
in
general
meeting
assembled
believe
it
to
be
the
duty
of
all
the
citizens
of
the
commonwealth
in
the
present
alarming
condition
of
our
country
to
give
some
expression
of
their
opinion
upon
the
threatening
aspect
of
public
affairs
in
the
controversies
with
the
mother
country
growing
out
of
the
effort
of
the
latter
to
tax
the
colonies
without
their
consent
it
was
virginia
who
by
the
resolution
against
the
stamp
act
gave
the
example
of
the
first
authoritative
resistance
by
a
legislative
body
to
the
british
government
and
so
imparted
the
first
impulse
to
the
revolution
virginia
declared
her
independence
before
any
of
the
colonies
and
gave
the
first
written
constitution
to
mankind
by
her
instructions
her
representatives
in
the
general
congress
introduced
a
resolution
to
declare
the
colonies
independent
states
and
the
declaration
itself
was
written
by
one
of
her
sons
she
furnished
to
the
confederate
states
the
father
of
his
country
under
whose
guidance
independence
was
achieved
and
the
rights
and
liberties
of
each
state
it
was
hoped
perpetually
established
she
stood
undismayed
through
the
long
night
of
the
revolution
breasting
the
storm
of
war
and
pouring
out
the
blood
of
her
sons
like
water
on
every
battlefield
from
the
ramparts
of
quebec
to
the
sands
of
a
cheer
broke
from
the
throng
that
she
did
that
she
did
virginia
never
tire
her
unaided
efforts
the
northwestern
territory
was
conquered
whereby
the
mississippi
instead
of
the
ohio
river
was
recognized
as
the
boundary
of
the
united
states
by
the
treaty
of
peace
to
secure
harmony
and
as
an
evidence
of
her
estimate
of
the
value
of
the
union
of
the
states
she
ceded
to
all
for
their
common
benefit
this
magnificent
region
an
empire
in
itself
when
the
articles
of
confederation
were
shown
to
be
inadequate
to
secure
peace
and
tranquillity
at
home
and
respect
abroad
virginia
first
moved
to
bring
about
a
more
perfect
union
at
her
instance
the
first
assemblage
of
commissioners
took
place
at
annapolis
which
ultimately
led
to
a
meeting
of
the
convention
which
formed
the
present
constitution
the
instrument
itself
was
in
a
great
measure
the
production
of
one
of
her
sons
who
has
been
justly
styled
the
father
of
the
constitution
the
government
created
by
it
was
put
into
operation
with
her
washington
the
father
of
his
country
at
its
head
her
jefferson
the
author
of
the
declaration
of
independence
in
his
cabinet
her
madison
the
great
advocate
of
the
constitution
in
the
legislative
and
each
of
the
three
cried
a
voice
left
on
record
his
judgment
as
to
the
integral
rights
of
the
federating
states
the
leading
of
virginia
statesmen
the
revolution
of
was
brought
about
louisiana
was
acquired
and
the
second
war
of
independence
was
waged
throughout
the
whole
progress
of
the
republic
she
has
never
infringed
on
the
rights
of
any
state
or
asked
or
received
an
exclusive
benefit
on
the
contrary
she
has
been
the
first
to
vindicate
the
equality
of
all
the
states
the
smallest
as
well
as
the
greatest
but
claiming
no
exclusive
benefit
for
her
efforts
and
sacrifices
in
the
common
cause
she
had
a
right
to
look
for
feelings
of
fraternity
and
kindness
for
her
citizens
from
the
citizens
of
other
states
and
that
the
common
government
to
the
promotion
of
which
she
contributed
so
largely
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
justice
and
ensuring
domestic
tranquillity
would
not
whilst
the
forms
of
the
constitution
were
observed
be
so
perverted
in
spirit
as
to
inflict
wrong
and
injustice
and
produce
universal
insecurity
these
reasonable
expectations
have
been
grievously
disappointed
there
arose
a
roar
of
assent
that
the
truth
that
the
plain
truth
north
and
south
we
leagues
asunder
we
do
think
alike
we
feel
alike
and
we
do
interpret
the
constitution
alike
i
tell
you
how
the
north
interprets
it
government
by
the
north
for
the
north
and
over
the
south
go
on
judge
allen
go
on
view
of
this
state
of
things
we
are
not
inclined
to
rebuke
or
censure
the
people
of
any
of
our
sister
states
in
the
south
suffering
from
injury
goaded
by
insults
and
threatened
with
such
outrages
and
wrongs
for
their
bold
determination
to
relieve
themselves
from
such
injustice
and
oppression
by
resorting
to
their
ultimate
and
sovereign
right
to
dissolve
the
compact
which
they
had
formed
and
to
provide
new
guards
for
their
future
south
carolina
georgia
too
will
be
out
in
alabama
as
well
mississippi
and
go
on
have
we
any
doubt
of
the
right
of
any
state
there
being
no
common
umpire
between
coequal
sovereign
states
to
judge
for
itself
on
its
own
responsibility
as
to
the
mode
and
manner
of
redress
the
states
each
for
itself
exercised
this
sovereign
power
when
they
dissolved
their
connection
with
the
british
empire
they
exercised
the
same
power
when
nine
of
the
states
seceded
from
the
confederation
and
adopted
the
present
constitution
though
two
states
at
first
rejected
it
the
articles
of
confederation
stipulated
that
those
articles
should
be
inviolably
observed
by
every
state
and
that
the
union
should
be
perpetual
and
that
no
alteration
should
be
made
unless
agreed
to
by
congress
and
confirmed
by
every
state
notwithstanding
this
solemn
compact
a
portion
of
the
states
did
without
the
consent
of
the
others
form
a
new
compact
and
there
is
nothing
to
show
or
by
which
it
can
be
shown
that
this
right
has
been
or
can
be
diminished
so
long
as
the
states
continue
the
right
the
right
of
and
it
inherent
and
inalienable
we
fought
for
it
when
did
we
fight
for
it
when
we
cease
to
fight
for
it
then
chaos
and
night
go
on
go
on
confederation
was
assented
to
by
the
legislature
for
each
state
the
constitution
by
the
people
of
each
state
for
such
state
alone
one
is
as
binding
as
the
other
and
no
more
so
the
constitution
it
is
true
established
a
government
and
it
operates
directly
on
the
individual
the
confederation
was
a
league
operating
primarily
on
the
states
but
each
was
adopted
by
the
state
for
itself
in
the
one
case
by
the
legislature
acting
for
the
state
in
the
other
by
the
people
not
as
individuals
composing
one
nation
but
as
composing
the
distinct
and
independent
states
to
which
they
respectively
belong
the
foundation
therefore
on
which
it
was
established
was
federal
and
the
state
in
the
exercise
of
the
same
sovereign
authority
by
which
she
ratified
for
herself
may
for
herself
abrogate
and
annul
the
operation
of
its
powers
whilst
the
state
remains
in
the
confederacy
is
national
and
consequently
a
state
remaining
in
the
confederacy
and
enjoying
its
benefits
can
not
by
any
mode
of
procedure
withdraw
its
citizens
from
the
obligation
to
obey
the
constitution
and
the
laws
passed
in
pursuance
thereof
but
when
a
state
does
secede
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states
cease
to
operate
therein
no
power
is
conferred
on
congress
to
enforce
them
such
authority
was
denied
to
the
congress
in
the
convention
which
framed
the
constitution
because
it
would
be
an
act
of
war
of
nation
against
nation
not
the
exercise
of
the
legitimate
power
of
a
government
to
enforce
its
laws
on
those
subject
to
its
jurisdiction
the
assumption
of
such
a
power
would
be
the
assertion
of
a
prerogative
claimed
by
the
british
government
to
legislate
for
the
colonies
in
all
cases
whatever
it
would
constitute
of
itself
a
dangerous
attack
on
the
rights
of
the
states
and
should
be
promptly
there
was
a
great
thunder
of
assent
that
is
our
doctrine
bred
in
the
bone
dyed
in
the
weaving
jefferson
madison
marshall
washington
henry
further
back
yet
further
back
back
to
magna
charta
principles
resulting
from
the
nature
of
our
system
of
confederate
states
can
not
admit
of
question
in
virginia
in
our
people
in
convention
by
their
act
of
ratification
declared
and
made
known
that
the
powers
granted
under
the
constitution
being
derived
from
the
people
of
the
united
states
may
be
resumed
by
them
whenever
they
shall
be
perverted
to
their
injury
and
oppression
from
what
people
were
these
powers
derived
confessedly
from
the
people
of
each
state
acting
for
themselves
by
whom
were
they
to
be
resumed
or
taken
back
by
the
people
of
the
state
who
were
then
granting
them
away
who
were
to
determine
whether
the
powers
granted
had
been
perverted
to
their
injury
or
oppression
not
the
whole
people
of
the
united
states
for
there
could
be
no
oppression
of
the
whole
with
their
own
consent
and
it
could
not
have
entered
into
the
conception
of
the
convention
that
the
powers
granted
could
not
be
resumed
until
the
oppressor
himself
united
in
such
resumption
they
asserted
the
right
to
resume
in
order
to
guard
the
people
of
virginia
for
whom
alone
the
convention
could
act
against
the
oppression
of
an
irresponsible
and
sectional
majority
the
worst
form
of
oppression
with
which
an
angry
providence
has
ever
afflicted
humanity
whilst
therefore
we
regret
that
any
state
should
in
a
matter
of
common
grievance
have
determined
to
act
for
herself
without
consulting
with
her
sister
states
equally
aggrieved
we
are
nevertheless
constrained
to
say
that
the
occasion
justifies
and
loudly
calls
for
action
of
some
kind
in
view
therefore
of
the
present
condition
of
our
country
and
the
causes
of
it
we
declare
almost
in
the
words
of
our
fathers
contained
in
an
address
of
the
freeholders
of
botetourt
in
february
to
the
delegates
from
virginia
to
the
continental
congress
that
we
desire
no
change
in
our
government
whilst
left
to
the
free
enjoyment
of
our
equal
privileges
secured
by
the
constitution
but
that
should
a
tyrannical
sectional
majority
under
the
sanction
of
the
forms
of
the
constitution
persist
in
acts
of
injustice
and
violence
toward
us
they
only
must
be
answerable
for
the
consequences
that
liberty
is
so
strongly
impressed
upon
our
hearts
that
we
can
not
think
of
parting
with
it
but
with
our
lives
that
our
duty
to
god
our
country
ourselves
and
our
posterity
forbid
it
we
stand
therefore
prepared
for
every
resolved
therefore
in
view
of
the
facts
set
out
in
the
foregoing
preamble
it
is
the
opinion
of
this
meeting
that
a
convention
of
the
people
should
be
called
forthwith
that
the
state
in
its
sovereign
character
should
consult
with
the
other
southern
states
and
agree
upon
such
guarantees
as
in
their
opinion
will
secure
their
equality
tranquillity
and
within
the
union
the
applause
shook
the
air
yes
yes
within
the
union
they
not
quite
mad
not
even
the
black
republicans
we
save
the
union
we
made
it
and
we
save
it
unless
the
north
takes
leave
of
its
go
on
in
the
event
of
a
failure
to
obtain
such
guarantees
to
adopt
in
concert
with
the
other
southern
or
alone
measures
as
may
seem
most
expedient
to
protect
the
rights
and
ensure
the
safety
of
the
people
of
the
reader

stood
with
dignity

then
a
beginning

beginning

grew
it
became
deep

with

the
currents
of
the
air
fixed
it
in
the
south
at
no
far
day
we
will
pass
from
under
it
in
the
mean
time
we
would
not
have
it
in
that
case
underneath
it
would
lie
ruined
fields
and
wrecked
homes
and
out
of
its
elements
would
come
a
fearful
pestilence
triumph
of
the
republican
no
slight
darkening
of
the
air
is
that
no
drifting
mist
of
the
morning
it
is
the
triumph
of
that
party
which
proclaims
the
constitution
a
covenant
with
death
and
an
agreement
with
hell
of
that
party
which
tolled
the
bells
and
fired
the
minute
guns
and
draped
its
churches
with
black
and
as
saint
and
martyr
the
instigator
of
a
bloody
and
servile
insurrection
in
a
sister
state
the
felon
and
murderer
john

the
radical
the
black
republican
faction
sectional
rule
fanaticism
violation
of
the

aggression
tyranny
and
wrong
all
these
are
in
the
bosom
of
that
cloud
sovereignty
of
the
where
is
the
tempest
which
threatens
here
here
virginians
but
in
the
pleasing
assertion
of
the
north
is
no
sovereignty
of
the
state
state
is
merely
to
the
union
what
a
county
is
to
a
state
o
shades
of
john
randolph
of
roanoke
of
patrick
henry
of
mason
and
madison
of
washington
and
jefferson
o
shade
of
john
marshall
even
whom
we
used
to
think
too
federal
the
union
we
thought
of
the
union
as
a
golden
thread
at
the
most
we
thought
of
it
as
a
strong
servant
we
had
made
between
us
we
thirteen
artificers
a
beautiful
talus
to
walk
our
coasts
and
cry
well
we
thought
so
by
the
gods
we
think
so
yet
that
our
union
the
golden
thread
the
faithful
servant
not
the
monster
that
frankenstein
made
not
this
minotaur
swallowing
states
sovereignty
of
the
state
virginia
fought
seven
years
for
the
sovereignty
of
virginia
wrung
it
eighty
years
ago
from
great
britain
and
has
not
since
resigned
it
being
different
in
most
things
possibly
the
north
is
different
also
in
this
it
may
be
that
those
states
have
renounced
the
liberty
they
fought
for
possibly
massachusetts
the
years
and
to
the
contrary
does
regard
herself
as
a
county
possibly
connecticut
for
all
that
there
was
a
hartford
convention
sees
herself
in
the
same
light
possibly
saith
is
so
and
brutus
is
an
honourable
man
but
virginia
has
not
renounced
eighty
years
ago
she
wrote
a
certain
motto
on
her
shield
the
letters
burn
bright
unterrified
then
she
entered
this
league
from
which
we
hoped
so
much
unterrified
should
a
slurring
hand
be
laid
upon
that
shield
will
she
leave
it
allan
gold
from
the
schoolhouse
on
thunder
run
listened
with
a
swelling
heart
then
amid
the
applause
which
followed
the
last
speaker
edged
his
way
along
the
crowded
old
brick
pavement
to
where
not
far
from
the
portico
he
made
out
the
broad
shoulders
the
waving
dark
hair
and
the
slouch
hat
of
a
young
man
with
whom
he
was
used
to
discuss
these
questions
hairston
breckinridge
glanced
down
at
the
pressure
upon
his
arm
recognized
the
hand
and
pursued
half
aloud
the
current
of
his
thought
i
do
believe
i
go
back
to
the
university
i
believe
any
of
us
will
go
back
to
the
hello
allan
i
for
the
preservation
of
the
union
said
allan
i
ca
help
it
we
made
it
and
we
loved
it
i
for
it
too
answered
the
other
in
reason
i
not
for
it
out
of
reason
in
these
affairs
out
of
reason
is
out
of
honour
there
nothing
sacred
in
the
word
that
men
should
bow
down
and
worship
it
the
thing
behind
the
word
that
counts
and
whoever
says
that
massachusetts
and
virginia
and
illinois
and
texas
are
united
just
now
is
a
fool
or
a
liar
who
this
colonel
anderson
is
bringing
forward
ah
we
have
the
union
now
who
is
it
albemarle
man
staying
at
major
in
the
army
home
on
whig
i
been
at
his
brother
place
near
charlottesville
from
the
portico
came
a
voice
i
am
sure
that
few
in
botetourt
need
an
introduction
here
we
no
more
than
others
are
free
from
vanity
and
we
think
we
know
a
hero
by
intuition
men
of
botetourt
we
have
the
honour
to
listen
to
major
fauquier
cary
who
carried
the
flag
up
chapultepec
amid
applause
a
man
of
perhaps
forty
years
spare
bronzed
and
soldierly
entered
the
clear
space
between
the
pillars
threw
out
his
arm
with
an
authoritative
gesture
and
began
to
speak
in
an
odd
dry
attractive
voice
you
are
too
good
he
said
clearly
i
afraid
you
do
know
fauquier
cary
very
well
after
all
he
no
hero
worse
luck
he
only
a
virginian
trying
to
do
the
right
as
he
sees
it
out
yonder
on
the
plains
with
the
apaches
and
the
comanches
and
the
sage
brush
and
the
desert
there
was
an
interruption
how
about
chapultepec
and
the
rio
grande
did
we
hear
something
about
a
fight
in
texas
the
speaker
laughed
a
fight
in
texas
folk
folk
if
you
knew
how
many
fights
there
are
in
texas
and
how
meritorious
it
is
to
keep
out
of
them
no
i
only
a
virginian
out
there
he
regarded
the
throng
with
his
magnetic
smile
his
slight
and
fine
air
of
gaiety
in
storm
as
you
know
i
am
by
no
means
the
only
virginian
and
they
are
heroes
the
others
if
you
like
real
heroes
brave
as
the
warriors
in
homer
and
a
long
sight
better
men
i
am
happy
to
report
to
his
kinsmen
here
that
general
joseph
johnston
is
in
health
still
loving
astronomy
still
reading
du
guesclin
still
studying
the
art
of
war
he
a
soldier
soldier
and
that
in
its
way
is
as
fine
a
thing
as
a
poet
poet
i
see
men
before
me
who
are
of
the
blood
of
the
lees
out
there
by
the
rio
grande
is
a
colonel
robert
lee
of
whom
virginia
may
well
be
proud
there
are
few
heights
in
those
western
deserts
but
he
carries
his
height
with
him
he
marked
for
greatness
and
there
are
stuart
and
dabney
maury
the
best
of
fellows
and
edward
dillon
and
walker
and
george
thomas
and
many
another
good
man
and
true
first
and
last
there
a
deal
of
old
virginia
following
mars
out
yonder
we
got
hardee
too
from
georgia
and
van
dorn
from
mississippi
and
albert
sidney
johnston
from
kentucky
no
better
men
in

better

and
there
are
others
as

with
whom
i
graduated
at
west

and
away

out
yonder
in
the
midst
of
sage
brush
and
apaches
when
any
of
us
chance
to
meet
around
a
there
we
sit
while
coyotes
are
yelling
off
in
the
dark
there
we
sit
and
tell
stories
of
home
of
virginia
and
pennsylvania
of
georgia
and
new
hampshire
he
paused
drew
himself
up
looked
out
over
the
throng
to
the
mountains
studied
for
a
moment
their
long
clean
line
then
dropped
his
glance
and
spoke
in
a
changed
tone
with
a
fiery
suddenness
a
lunge
as
of
a
tried
rapier
quick
and
startling
men
of
botetourt
i
speak
for
my
fellow
soldiers
of
the
army
of
the
united
states
when
i
say
that
out
yonder
we
are
blithe
to
fight
with
marauding
comanches
with
wolves
and
with
grizzlies
but
that
we
are
not
oh
we
are
not
ready
to
fight
with
each
other
brother
against
brother
comrade
against
comrade
friend
against
friend
to
quarrel
in
the
same
tongue
and
to
slay
the
man
with
whom
you
faced
a
thousand
dangers
no
we
are
not
ready
for
that
virginians
i
will
not
believe
that
the
permanent
dissolution
of
this
great
union
is
come
i
will
not
believe
that
we
stand
in
danger
of
internecine
war
men
of
botetourt
go
slow
go
slow
the
right
of
the
state
i
grant
it
i
was
bred
in
that
doctrine
as
were
you
all
albemarle
no
whit
behind
botetourt
in
that
the
botetourt
resolutions
amen
to
much
to
very
much
in
the
botetourt
resolutions
south
carolina
let
south
carolina
go
in
peace
it
is
her
right
remembering
old
comradeship
old
battlefields
old
defeats
old
victories
we
shall
still
be
friends
if
the
gulf
states
go
still
it
is
their
right
immemorial
incontrovertible
the
right
of
we
are
of
one
blood
and
the
country
is
wide
both
to
lot
and
to
abraham
on
some
sunny
future
day
may
their
children
draw
together
and
take
hands
again
so
much
for
the
seceding
states
but
virginia
but
virginia
made
possible
the
union
let
her
stand
fast
in
it
in
this
day
of
storm
in
this
convention
let
her
voice
be
heard
as
i
know
it
will
be
heard
for
wisdom
for
moderation
for
patience
so
or
soon
or
late
she
will
mediate
between
the
states
she
will
once
again
make
the
ring
complete
she
will
be
the
saviour
of
this
great
historic
confederation
which
our
fathers
made
a
minute
or
two
more
and
he
ended
his
speech
as
he
moved
from
between
the
pillars
there
was
loud
applause
the
county
was
largely
whig
honestly
longing
having
put
on
record
what
it
thought
of
the
present
mischief
and
the
makers
of
it
for
a
peaceful
solution
of
all
troubles
as
for
the
army
county
and
state
were
proud
of
the
army
and
proud
of
the
virginians
within
it
it
was
amid
cheering
that
fauquier
cary
left
the
portico
at
the
head
of
the
steps
however
there
came
a
question
one
moment
major
cary
what
if
the
north
declines
to
evacuate
fort
sumter
what
if
she
attempts
to
reinforce
it
what
if
she
declares
for
a
union
cary
paused
a
moment
she
will
not
she
will
not
there
are
politicians
in
the
north
whom
i
not
defend
but
the
people
the
people
the
people
are
neither
fools
nor
knaves
they
were
born
north
and
we
were
born
south
and
that
is
the
chief
difference
between
us
a
union
that
is
a
contradiction
in
terms
individuals
and
states
harmoniously
minded
unite
for
the
sweetness
of
union
and
for
the
furtherance
of
common
interests
when
the
minds
are
discordant
and
the
interests
opposed
one
may
be
bound
to
another
by
conquest
not
otherwise
what
said
hamilton
coerce
a
state
would
be
one
of
the
maddest
projects
ever
devised
he
descended
the
court
house
steps
to
the
grassy
crowded
yard
here
acquaintances
claimed
him
and
here
at
last
the
surge
of
the
crowd
brought
him
within
a
yard
of
allan
gold
and
his
companion
the
latter
spoke
major
cary
you
do
remember
me
hairston
breckinridge
sir
and
i
been
once
or
twice
to
greenwood
with
edward
i
was
there
christmas
before
last
when
you
came
home
wounded
the
older
man
put
out
a
ready
hand
yes
yes
i
do
remember
we
had
a
merry
christmas
i
am
glad
to
meet
you
again
breckinridge
is
this
your
brother
no
sir
it
allan
gold
from
thunder
run
i
am
pleased
to
meet
you
sir
said
allan
you
have
been
saying
what
i
should
like
to
have
been
able
to
say
myself
i
am
pleased
that
you
are
pleased
are
you
too
from
the
university
no
sir
i
could
go
i
teach
the
school
on
thunder
run
allan
knows
more
said
hairston
breckinridge
than
many
of
us
who
are
at
the
university
but
we
must
keep
you
sir
in
effect
they
could
do
so
no
longer
major
cary
was
swept
away
by
acquaintances
and
connections
the
day
was
declining
the
final
speaker
drawing
to
an
end
the
throng
beginning
to
shiver
in
the
deepening
cold
the
speaker
gave
his
final
sentence
the
town
band
crashed
in
determinedly
with
home
sweet
home
to
its
closing
strains
the
county
people
afoot
on
horseback
in
old
roomy
carriages
took
this
road
and
that
the
townsfolk
still
excited
still
discussing
lingered
awhile
round
the
court
house
or
on
the
verandah
of
the
old
hotel
but
at
last
these
groups
dissolved
also
the
units
betook
themselves
home
to
fireside
and
supper
and
the
sun
set
behind
the
alleghenies
allan
gold
striding
over
the
hills
toward
thunder
run
caught
up
with
the
miller
from
mill
creek
and
the
two
walked
side
by
side
until
their
roads
diverged
the
miller
was
a
slow
man
but
there
was
a
red
in
his
cheek
and
a
light
in
his
eye
just
so
he
said
shortly
they
must
keep
out
of
my
mill
race
or
they
get
caught
in
the
wheel
green
said
allan
how
much
of
all
this
trouble
do
you
suppose
is
really
about
the
negro
i
was
brought
up
to
wish
that
virginia
had
never
held
a
slave
so
were
most
of
us
you
do
hold
any
no
no
more
i
do
no
more
does
tom
watts
nor
anderson
west
nor
the
taylors
nor
five
sixths
of
the
farming
folk
about
here
nor
seven
eighths
of
the
townspeople
we
do
own
a
negro
and
i
do
know
that
we
ever
did
own
one
not
long
ago
i
asked
colonel
anderson
a
lot
of
questions
about
the
matter
he
says
the
census
this
year
gives
virginia
one
million
and
fifty
thousand
white
people
and
of
these
the
fifty
thousand
hold
slaves
and
the
one
million
do
the
fifty
mostly
in
the
counties
too
mighty
little
of
it
on
this
side
the
blue
ridge
ai
anybody
ever
accused
virginians
of
not
being
good
to
servants
and
it
do
take
half
an
eye
to
see
that
the
servants
love
their
white
people
for
slavery
itself
i
quarrelling
for
it
and
neither
was
colonel
anderson
he
said
it
was
abhorrent
in
the
sight
of
god
and
man
he
said
the
old
house
of
burgesses
used
to
try
to
stop
the
bringing
in
of
negroes
and
that
the
colony
was
always
appealing
to
the
king
against
the
traffic
he
said
that
in
two
years
after
virginia
declared
her
independence
she
passed
the
statute
prohibiting
the
slave
trade
he
said
that
she
was
the
first
country
in
the
civilized
world
to
stop
the
trade
passed
her
statute
thirty
years
before
england
he
said
that
all
our
great
revolutionary
men
hated
slavery
and
worked
for
the
emancipation
of
the
negroes
who
were
here
that
men
worked
openly
and
hard
for
it
until
then
came
the
nat
turner
insurrection
when
they
killed
all
those
women
and
children
and
then
rose
the
abolition
people
stirring
gunpowder
with
a
lighted
stick
holding
on
like
grim
death
and
in
perfect
safety
fifteen
hundred
miles
from
where
the
explosion
was
due
and
as
they
denounce
without
thinking
so
a
lot
of
men
have
risen
with
us
to
advocate
without
thinking
and
underneath
all
the
clamour
there
goes
on
all
the
time
quiet
and
steady
a
freeing
of
negroes
by
deed
and
will
a
settling
them
in
communities
in
free
states
a
belonging
to
and
supporting
colonization
societies
there
are
now
forty
thousand
free
negroes
in
virginia
and
heaven
knows
how
many
have
been
freed
and
established
elsewhere
it
is
our
best
people
who
make
these
wills
freeing
their
slaves
and
in
virginia
at
least
everybody
sooner
or
later
follows
the
best
people
manumission
green
that
what
colonel
anderson
said
colonization
in
africa
if
possible
the
difficulties
are
enough
to
turn
a
man
hair
grey
but
said
he
knell
has
struck
and
put
an
end
to
it
in
virginia
peacefully
and
with
some
approach
to
wisdom
if
only
they
stop
stirring
the
gunpowder
the
miller
raised
his
large
head
with
its
effect
of
white
powder
from
the
mill
and
regarded
the
landscape
all
mighty
blind
poor
creatures
as
the
preacher
says
but
i
reckon
one
day
we
find
the
right
way
both
for
us
and
for
that
half
million
poor
lovable
people
that
king
james
and
king
charles
and
king
george
saddled
us
with
not
much
to
their
betterment
and
to
our
certain
hurt
i
reckon
we
find
it
but
i
damned
if
i
going
to
take
the
north
word
for
it
that
she
has
the
way
her
old
way
was
to
sell
her
negroes
south
i
thought
and
thought
said
allan
people
mean
well
and
yet
there
such
a
dreadful
lot
of
tragedy
in
the
world
i
agree
with
you
there
quoth
the
miller
and
i
certainly
do
deny
that
slavery
responsible
for
a
lot
of
bitter
talk
and
a
lot
of
feeling
for
some
suffering
to
some
negroes
too
and
for
a
deal
of
harm
to
almost
all
whites
and
i
for
one
will
be
powerful
glad
when
every
negro
man
and
woman
is
free
they
can
never
really
grow
until
they
are
free
i
acknowledge
that
and
if
they
want
to
go
back
to
their
own
country
i
pay
my
mite
to
help
them
along
i
think
i
owe
it
to
them
even
though
as
far
as
i
know
i
have
a
forbear
that
ever
did
them
wrong
trouble
is
do
any
of
them
want
to
go
back
you
scare
them
worse
than
to
tell
them
you
were
going
to
help
them
back
to
their
fatherland
the
lauderdale
negroes
for
instance
never
see
one
that
he
is
laughing
and
tullius
at
three
oaks
say
he
could
possibly
think
of
going
must
stay
at
three
oaks
and
look
after
miss
margaret
and
the
children
no
it
is
an
easy
subject
look
at
it
any
way
you
will
but
as
between
us
and
the
north
it
ai
the
main
subject
of
quarrel
not
by
a
long
shot
it
ai
the
quarrel
that
a
man
wants
to
take
all
the
grist
mine
as
well
as
his
and
grind
it
in
his
mill
well
i
wo
let
him
that
all
and
here
your
road
to
thunder
run
allan
strode
on
alone
over
the
frozen
hills
before
him
sprang
the
rampart
of
the
mountains
magnificently
drawn
against
the
eastern
sky
to
either
hand
lay
the
fallow
fields
rolled
the
brown
hills
rose
the
shadowy
bulk
of
forest
trees
showed
the
green
of
winter
wheat
the
evening
was
cold
but
without
wind
and
soundless
the
birds
had
flown
south
the
cattle
were
stalled
the
sheep
folded
there
was
only
the
earth
field
and
hill
and
mountain
the
up
and
down
of
a
narrow
road
and
the
glimmer
of
a
distant
stream
the
sunset
had
been
red
and
it
left
a
colour
that
flared
to
the
zenith
the
young
man
tall
blond
with
eyes
and
short
fair
beard
covered
with
long
strides
the
frozen
road
it
led
him
over
a
lofty
hill
whose
summit
commanded
a
wide
prospect
allan
reaching
this
height
hesitated
a
moment
then
crossed
to
a
grey
zigzag
of
rail
fence
and
leaning
his
arms
upon
it
looked
forth
over
hill
and
vale
forest
and
stream
the
afterglow
was
upon
the
land
he
looked
at
the
mountains
the
great
mountains
long
and
clean
of
line
as
the
marching
rollers
of
a
giant
sea
not
split
or
jagged
but
even
unbroken
and
old
old
the
oldest
almost
in
the
world
now
the
ancient
forest
clothed
them
while
they
were
given
by
some
constant
trick
of
the
light
the
distant
dreamy
blue
from
which
they
took
their
name
the
blue
ridge
the
blue
ridge
and
then
the
hills
and
the
valleys
and
all
the
rushing
creeks
and
the
grandeur
of
the
trees
and
to
the
east
steel
clear
between
the
sycamores
and
the
willows
the
river
the
upper
reaches
of
the
river
james
the
glow
deepened
from
a
farmhouse
in
the
valley
came
the
sound
of
a
bell
allan
straightened
himself
lifting
his
arms
from
the
grey
old
rails
he
spoke
aloud
breathes
there
the
man
with
soul
so
dead
the
bell
rang
again
the
rose
suffused
the
sky
to
the
zenith
the
young
man
drew
a
long
breath
and
turning
began
to
descend
the
hill
before
him
at
a
turn
of
the
road
and
overhanging
a
precipitous
hollow
in
the
spring
carpeted
with
bloodroot
but
now
thick
with
dead
leaves
lay
a
giant
oak
long
ago
struck
down
by
lightning
the
branches
had
been
cut
away
but
the
blackened
trunk
remained
and
from
it
as
vantage
point
one
received
another
great
view
of
the
rolling
mountains
and
the
valleys
between
allan
gold
coming
down
the
hill
became
aware
first
of
a
horse
fastened
to
a
wayside
sapling
then
of
a
man
seated
upon
the
fallen
oak
his
back
to
the
road
his
face
to
the
darkening
prospect
below
him
the
winter
wind
made
a
rustling
in
the
dead
leaves
evidently
another
had
paused
to
admire
the
view
or
to
collect
and
mould
between
the
hands
of
the
soul
the
crowding
impressions
of
a
decisive
day
it
was
apparently
the
latter
purpose
for
as
allan
approached
the
ravine
there
came
to
him
out
of
the
dusk
in
a
controlled
but
vibrant
voice
the
following
statement
repeated
three
times
we
are
going
to
have
we
are
going
to
have
we
are
going
to
have
war
allan
sent
his
own
voice
before
him
i
trust
in
god
that
not
true
it
richard
cleave
there
is
it
the
figure
on
the
oak
swinging
itself
around
sat
outlined
against
the
violet
sky
yes
richard
cleave
it
a
night
to
make
one
think
allan
to
make
one
think
to
make
one
think
laying
his
hand
on
the
trunk
beside
him
he
sprang
lightly
down
to
the
roadside
where
he
proceeded
to
brush
dead
leaf
and
bark
from
his
clothing
with
an
old
gauntlet
when
he
spoke
it
was
still
in
the
same
moved
vibrating
voice
war
my
that
a
curious
thing
to
be
said
by
a
country
lawyer
in
peaceful
old
virginia
in
this
year
of
grace
but
like
many
another
curious
thing
it
true
i
was
never
on
a
field
of
battle
but
i
know
all
about
a
field
of
battle
he
shook
his
head
lifted
his
hand
and
flung
it
out
toward
the
mountains
i
do
want
war
mind
you
allan
that
is
the
great
stream
at
the
bottom
does
want
it
war
is
a
word
that
means
agony
to
many
and
a
to
all
reason
tells
me
that
and
my
heart
wishes
the
world
neither
agony
nor
and
i
give
my
word
for
peace
only
only
before
this
life
i
must
have
fought
all
along
the
line
his
eyes
lightened
against
the
paling
sky
in
the
wintry
air
his
powerful
frame
not
tall
but
looked
larger
than
life
i
do
talk
this
way
often
as
you
grant
he
said
and
laughed
but
i
suppose
loosed
all
our
tongues
lifted
every
man
out
of
himself
if
war
came
said
allan
it
could
be
a
long
war
could
it
after
the
first
battle
we
come
to
an
understanding
would
we
answered
the
other
would
we
god
knows
in
the
past
it
has
been
that
the
more
equal
the
tinge
of
blood
the
fiercer
was
the
war
as
he
spoke
he
moved
across
to
the
sapling
where
was
fastened
his
horse
loosed
him
and
sprang
into
the
saddle
the
horse
a
magnificent
bay
took
the
road
and
the
three
began
the
long
descent
it
was
very
cold
and
still
a
crescent
moon
in
the
sky
and
lights
beginning
to
shine
from
the
farmhouses
in
the
valley
though
i
teach
school
said
allan
i
like
the
open
i
like
to
do
things
with
my
hands
and
i
like
to
go
in
and
out
of
the
woods
perhaps
all
the
way
behind
us
i
was
a
hunter
with
a
taste
for
books
my
grandfather
was
a
scout
in
the
revolution
and
his
father
was
a
ranger
god
knows
do
want
war
but
if
it
comes
i
go
all
go
i
reckon
yes
we
all
go
said
cleave
we
need
to
go
the
one
rode
the
other
walked
in
silence
for
a
time
then
said
the
first
i
shall
ride
to
lauderdale
after
supper
and
talk
to
fauquier
cary
you
and
he
are
cousins
are
you
third
cousins
his
mother
was
a
dandridge
unity
dandridge
i
like
him
it
like
old
wine
and
blue
steel
and
a
cavalier
poet
that
type
yes
it
is
old
and
fine
in
men
and
in
women
he
does
not
want
war
no
hairston
breckinridge
says
that
he
wo
discuss
the
possibility
at
all
he
only
say
what
he
said
that
every
one
should
work
for
peace
and
that
war
between
brothers
is
horrible
it
is
no
he
wears
a
uniform
he
can
not
talk
they
went
on
in
silence
for
a
time
over
the
winter
road
through
the
crystal
air
between
the
branches
of
the
trees
the
sky
showed
intense
and
cold
the
crescent
moon
above
a
black
mass
of
mountains
golden
and
sharp
the
lights
in
the
valley
near
enough
to
be
gathered
if
there
should
be
war
asked
allan
what
will
they
do
all
the
virginians
in
the
army
lee
and
johnston
and
stuart
maury
and
thomas
and
the
rest
they
come
home
resigning
their
commissions
resigning
their
commissions
allan
sighed
that
would
be
a
hard
thing
to
have
to
do
they
do
it
would
you
the
teacher
from
thunder
run
looked
from
the
dim
valley
and
the
household
lamps
up
to
the
marching
stars
yes
if
my
state
called
i
would
do
it
this
is
what
will
happen
said
cleave
there
are
times
when
a
man
sees
clearly
and
i
see
clearly
the
north
does
not
intend
to
evacuate
fort
sumter
instead
sooner
or
later
she
try
to
reinforce
it
that
will
be
the
beginning
of
the
end
south
carolina
will
reduce
the
fort
the
north
will
preach
a
holy
war
war
there
will
be
whether
holy
or
not
remains
to
be
seen
virginia
will
be
called
upon
to
furnish
her
quota
of
troops
with
which
to
coerce
south
carolina
and
the
gulf
states
back
into
the
union
well
do
you
think
she
will
give
them
allan
gave
a
short
laugh
no
that
is
what
will
happen
and
then
and
then
a
greater
state
than
any
will
be
forced
into
secession
and
then
the
virginians
in
the
army
will
come
home
the
wood
gave
way
to
open
country
softly
swelling
fields
willow
copses
and
clear
running
streams
in
the
crystal
air
the
mountain
walls
seemed
near
at
hand
above
shone
orion
icily
brilliant
the
lawyer
from
a
dim
old
house
in
a
grove
of
oaks
and
the
from
thunder
run
went
on
in
silence
for
a
time
then
the
latter
spoke
hairston
breckinridge
says
that
major
cary
niece
is
with
him
at
lauderdale
yes
judith
cary
that
the
beautiful
one

it
they
are
all
said
to
be
beautiful
the
three
greenwood
carys
but
yes
that
is
the
beautiful
one
he
began
to
hum
a
song
and
as
he
did
so
he
lifted
his
wide
soft
hat
and
rode
bareheaded
it
strange
to
me
said
allan
presently
that
any
one
should
be
gay
as
he
spoke
he
glanced
up
at
the
face
of
the
man
riding
beside
him
on
the
great
bay
there
was
yet
upon
the
road
a
faint
enough
light
to
reveal
that
there
were
tears
on
cleave
cheek
involuntarily
allan
uttered
an
exclamation
the
other
breaking
off
his
chant
quite
simply
put
up
a
gauntleted
hand
and
wiped
the
moisture
away
gay
he
repeated
i
not
gay
what
gave
you
such
an
idea
i
tell
you
that
though
i
never
been
in
a
war
i

came
a
little
later
to
his
own
house
old
and
not
large
crowning
a
grassy
slope
above
a
running
stream
he
left
the
highway
opened
a
gate
and
passed
between
fallow
fields
to
a
second
gate
opened
this
and
skirting
a
knoll
upon
which
were
set
three
gigantic
oaks
rode
up
a
short
and
drive
it
led
him
to
the
back
of
the
house
and
afar
off
his
dogs
began
to
give
him
welcome
when
he
had
dismounted
before
the
porch
a
negro
boy
with
a
lantern
took
his

the
hall
was
cold
and
in
but
through
the
door
of
his
mother
chamber
came
a
gush
of
firelight
warm
and
bright
her
voice
reached
him
richard
he
entered
she
was
sitting
in
a
great
old
chair
by
the
fire
idle
for
a
wonder
her
hands
fine
and
slender
clasped
over
her
knees
the
light
struck
up
against
her
fair
brooding
face
it
is
late
she
said
late
and
cold
come
to
the
fire
ailsy
will
have

minute
he
came
and

is
always
warm
in

where

the
children
down
at
tullius

drew
before
the
fire
the
chair
that

been
his
father
sank
into
it
and
taking
the
ash
stick
from
the
corner
stirred
the
glowing
logs
judge
allen

read
and
carried
fauquier
cary
spoke
many
others
did
not
you
no
they
asked
me
to
but
with
so
many
there
was
no
need
people
were
much
moved
he
broke
off
sitting
stirring
the
fire
his
mother
watched
the
deep
hollows
with
him
closely
resembling
as
he
did
his
long
dead
father
the
inner
tie
strong
and
fine
was
rather
between
him
and
the
woman
who
had
given
him
birth
wedded
ere
she
was
seventeen
a
mother
at
eighteen
she
sat
now
beside
her
still
beautiful
and
crowned
by
a
lovely
life
she
had
kept
her
youth
and
he
had
come
early
to
a
responsibilities
for
years
now
they
had
walked
together
caring
for
the
farm
which
was
not
large
for
the
handful
of
servants
for
the
two
younger
children
will
and
miriam
the
eighteen
years
between
them
was
cancelled
by
their
common
interests
his
maturity
of
thought
her
quality
of
the
summer
time
she
broke
the
silence
what
did
fauquier

he
spoke
strongly
for

to
his
feet

upstairs
for
a
moment
margaret

put
out
a
detaining
hand
one
moment
richard
are
you
quite
quite
sure
that
she
likes
maury
stafford
so
well
why
should
she
not
like
him
he
a
likable
fellow
so
are
many
people
so
are
you
cleave
gave
a
short
and
wintry
laugh
i
i
am
only
her
cousin
rather
a
dull
cousin
too
who
does
nothing
much
in
the
law
and
is
not
even
a
very
good
farmer
am
i
sure
yes
i
am
sure
enough
his
hand
closed
on
the
back
of
her
chair
the
wood
shook
under
the
sombre
energy
of
his
grasp
did
i
not
see
how
it
was
last
summer
that
week
i
spent
at
greenwood
was
he
not
always
with
her
supple
and
keen
easy
and
strong
with
his
face
like
a
picture
with
all
the
advantages
i
did
not
have
education
travel
wealth
why
edward
told
me
and
could
i
not
see
for
myself
it
was
in
the
air
of
the
place
not
a
servant
but
knew
he
had
come
but
there
was
no
engagement
then
had
there
been
we
should
have
known
it
no
engagement
then
perhaps
but
certainly
no
discouragement
he
was
there
again
in
the
autumn
he
was
with
her
the
chair
shook
again
and
this
morning
fauquier
cary
talking
to
me
laughed
and
said
that
albemarle
had
set
their
wedding
day
his
mother
sighed
oh
i
am
sorry
sorry
i
should
never
have
gone
to
greenwood
last
summer
never
have
spent
there
that
unhappy
week
before
that
it
was
just
a
fancy
and
then
i
must
go
and
let
it
bite
into
heart
and
brain
and
life
he
dropped
his
hand
abruptly
and
turned
to
the
door
well
i
got
to
try
now
to
think
only
of
the
country
god
knows
things
have
come
to

pass

her
sons
should
think
only
of
her

time
mother
the
birds
are

now
save

those
two
upstairs
in
his
bare
room
his
hasty
toilet
made
he
stood
upon
the
hearth
beside
the
leaping
fire
and
looked
about
him
of
late
since
the
summer
everything
was
clarifying
there
was
at
work
some
great
solvent
making
into
naught
the
dross
of
custom
and
habitude
the
glass
had
turned
outlines
were
clearer
than
they
had
been
the
light
was
strong
and
striking
from
a
changed
angle
both
the
sight
of
a
face
and
the
thought
of
an
endangered
state
had
worked
to
make
the
light
intenser
his
old
familiar
room
looked
strange
to
him
a
tall
bookcase
faced
him
he
went
across
and
stood
before
it
staring
through
the
diamond
panes
at
the
backs
of
the
books
here
were
his
coke
and
blackstone
vattel
henning
kent
and
tucker
and
here
were
other
books
of
which
he
was
fonder
than
of
those
and
here
were
a
few
volumes
of
the
poets
of
them
all
only
the
poets
managed
to
keep
a
familiar
look
he
took
out
a
volume
old
and
opened
it
at
random
her
face
so
faire
as
flesh
it
seemed
not
but
hevenly
pourtraict
of
bright
angels
hew
cleare
as
the
sky
withouten
blame
or
blot
a
bell
rang
below
youthful
and
gay
shattering
the
quiet
of
the
house
a
burst
of
voices
proclaimed
the
children
return
from
cabin
when
in
another
moment
cleave
came
downstairs
it
was
to
find
them
both
in
wait
at
the
foot
illumined
by
the
light
from
the
door
miriam
laid
hold
of
him
richard
richard
tell
me
quick
which
was
the
greatest
achilles
or
hector
will
slight
and
fair
home
for
the
holidays
from
lexington
and
by
virtue
of
his
cadetship
in
the
virginia
military
institute
an
authority
on
most
things
had
a
movement
of
impatience
girls
are
so
stupid
tell
her
it
was
hector
and
let
go
to
supper
she
believe
you
within
the
at
the
round
table
before
the
few
pieces
of
tall
beaded
silver
and
the
china
while
mehalah
the
waitress
brought
the
cakes
from
the
kitchen
and
the
fire
burned
softly
on
the
hearth
below
the
saint
memin
of
a
general
and
talk
fell
at
once
upon
the
event
of
the
day
the
meeting
that
had
passed
the
botetourt
resolutions
miriam
with
her
wide
sensitive
mouth
her
nose
her
hazel
eyes
her
air
of
some
quaint
bright
garden
flower
swaying
on
its
stem
was
for
war
and
music
and
both
her
brothers
to
become
generals
or
richard
can
be
the
general
and
you
be
a
cavalryman
like
cousin
fauquier
richard
can
fight
like
napoleon
and
you
may
fight
like
ney
the
cadet
stiffened
thank
you
for
nothing
missy
anyhow
i
sulk
in
my
tents
like
your
precious
achilles
just
for
a
girl
richard
jack
says
i
wish
will
murmured
his
mother
that
you
say
jackson
the
boy
laughed
jack
is
what
we
call
him
the
other
would
be
respectful
he
never
jackson
except
when
trying
to
teach
natural
philosophy
on
the
drill
ground
he
jack
richard
he
says
old
jack
says
that
not
a
man
since
napoleon
has
understood
the
use
of
cavalry
cleave
sitting
with
his
eyes
upon
the
portrait
of
his
grandfather
answered
dreamily
old
jack
is
probably
in
the
right
of
it
will
cavalry
is
a
great
arm
but
i
shall
choose
the
artillery
his
mother
set
down
her
coffee
cup
with
a
little
noise
miriam
shook
her
hair
out
of
her
eyes
and
came
back
from
her
own
dream
of
the
story
she
was
reading
and
will
turned
as
sharply
as
if
he
were
on
the
parade
ground
at
lexington
you
do
think
then
that
it
is
just
all
talk
richard
you
are
sure
that
we
going
to
fight
you
fight
cried
miriam
why
you
are
sixteen
will
flared
up
plenty
of
soldiers
have
at
sixteen
missy
jack
knows
if
you
do
children
children
said
margaret
cleave
in
a
quivering
voice
it
is
enough
to
know
that
not
a
man
of
this
family
but
would
fight
now
for
virginia
just
as
they
fought
eighty
odd
years
ago
yes
and
we
women
did
our
part
then
and
we
would
do
it
now
but
i
pray
god
night
and
day
and
miriam
you
should
pray
too
that
this
storm
will
not
burst
as
for
you
two
who
always
been
sheltered
and
fed
who
never
had
a
blow
struck
you
who
grown
like
tended
plants
in
a
garden
you
know
what
war
is
it
a
great
and
deep
cup
of
trembling
it
a
scourge
that
reaches
the
backs
of
all
it
universal
destruction
and
the
gift
that
the
world
should
pray
for
is
to
build
in
peace
that
is
true
it
richard
yes
it
is
true
said
richard
do
will
as
the
boy
began
to
speak
do
let
talk
any
more
about
it
after
all
a
deal
of
storms
go
by
and
it
a
wise
man
who
can
read
time
he
rose
from
the
table
it
like
the
fable
the
king
may
die
the
ass
may
die
the
philosopher
may
die
and
next
christmas
maybe
the
peacefullest
on
record
i
going
to
ride
to
lauderdale
for
a
little
while
and
if
you
like
i
ask
about
that
shotgun
for
you
a
few
minutes
later
and
he
was
out
on
the
starlit
road
to
lauderdale
as
he
rode
he
thought
not
of
the
botetourt
resolutions
nor
of
fauquier
cary
nor
of
allan
gold
nor
of
the
supper
table
at
three
oaks
nor
of
a
case
which
he
must
fight
through
at
the
court
house
three
days
hence
but
of
judith
cary
dundee
hoofs
beat
it
out
on
the
frosty
ground
cary
judith
cary
judith
cary
he
thought
of
greenwood
of
the
garden
there
of
a
week
last
summer
of
maury
stafford
stafford
whom
at
first
meeting
he
had
thought
most
likable
he
did
not
think
him
so
there
at
silver
hill
ready
to
go
to
lauderdale
cary
judith
cary
judith
he
saw
stafford
beside
her
stafford
beside
her
stafford
beside
her
if
she
love
him
said
cleave
half
aloud
he
must
be
worthy
i
will
not
be
so
petty
nor
so
bitter
i
wish
her
cary
judith
if
she
love
him
to
the
left
a
little
stream
brawled
through
frosty
meadows
to
the
right
rose
a
low
hill
black
with
cedars
along
the
southern
horizon
stretched
the
blue
ridge
a
wall
of
the
titans
a
rampart
in
the
night
the
line
was
long
and
clean
behind
it
was
an
effect
of
light
a
gleaming
above
blazed
the
winter
stars
if
she
love
him
if
she
love
him
he
determined
that
at
lauderdale
he
would
try
to
see
her
alone
for
a
minute
he
would
find
out
he
must
find
out
if
there
were
any
doubt
he
would
resolve
it
the
air
was
very
still
and
clear
he
heard
a
carriage
before
him
on
the
road
it
was
coming
toward
him
a
horseman
too
evidently
riding
beside
it
just
ahead
the
road
crossed
a
bridge
not
a
good
place
for
passing
in
the
cleave
drew
a
little
aside
reining
in
dundee
with
a
hollow
rumbling
the
carriage
passed
the
streams
it
proved
to
be
an
coach
with
lamps
drawn
by
strong
slow
grey
horses
cleave
recognized
the
silver
hill
equipage
silver
hill
must
have
been
supping
with
lauderdale
immediately
he
divined
who
was
the
horseman
the
carriage
drew
alongside
the
lamps
making
a
small
ring
of
light
mr
stafford
said
cleave
the
other
raised
his
hat
cleave
is
it

voice

within

in
savage
pain

spoke
quietly
in

controlled
but
vibrant
voice
he
had
used
on
the
hilltop

until
cleave
had

it
has
been
an
exciting
day
he
said
i

the
parting
of

think

with
fauquier
cary
a
little
longer
that

quite
true
said
cleave
slowly
i
do
not

and
so
i
will
pursue
my
road
to
lauderdale
and
make
the
most
of
him
he
turned
his
horse
lifted
his
hat
stafford
did
likewise
they
parted
and
cleave
presently
heard
the
rapid
hoofbeat
overtake
the
silver
hill
coach
and
at
once
change
to
a
slower
rhythm
now
is
speaking
with
her
through
the
window
the
sound
of
wheel
and
hoof
died
away
cleave
shook
dundee

and
went
on
toward

at

rested
upon

couch
by
the
fire

curled
on
the
rug
with
a
book
an
apple
and
tabitha
the
cat
will
mended
a
and
discoursed
of
old
jack
it
a
fact
wilson
worked
the
problem
gave
the
solution
and
got
from
old
jack
a
regular
withering
up
they
all
tell
you
that
he
excels
in
withering
up
are
wrong
wilson
says
he
in
that
tone
of
his
dry
as
tinder
and
makes
you
stop
like
a
are
always
wrong
go
to
your
seat
sir
well
old
wilson
went
of
course
and
sat
there
so
angry
he
was
shivering
you
see
he
was
right
and
he
knew
it
well
the
day
went
on
about
as
usual
it
set
in
to
snow
and
by
night
there
was
what
a
western
man
we
got
calls
a
barracks
like
an
ice
house
and
snowing
so
you
could
see
across
the
campus
was
so
deadly
cold
and
the
lights
so
dismal
that
we
rather
looked
forward
to
taps
up
comes
an
orderly
wilson
to
the
commandant
office
well
old
wilson
looked
startled
for
he
done
anything
but
off
he
marches
the
rest
of
us
predicting
hanging
well
whom
d
ye
reckon
he
found
in
the
commandant
office
old
jack
good
marksmanship
it
was
old
jack
snow
all
over
snow
on
his
coat
on
his
big
boots
on
his
beard
on
his
cap
he
lives
most
a
mile
from
the
institute
and
the
weather
was
bad
sure
enough
well
old
wilson
know
what
to
expect
most
likely
hot
shot
grape
and
canister
with
musketry
fire
thrown
in
but
he
saluted
and
stood
fast
wilson
says
old
jack
returning
home
and
going
over
with
closed
eyes
after
supper
as
is
my
custom
the
day
work
i
discovered
that
you
were
right
this
morning
and
i
was
wrong
your
solution
was
correct
i
felt
it
to
be
your
due
that
i
should
tell
you
of
my
mistake
as
soon
as
i
discovered
it
i
apologise
for
the
statement
that
you
were
always
wrong
you
may
go
sir
well
old
wilson
never
could
tell
what
he
said
but
anyhow
he
accepted
the
apology
and
saluted
and
got
out
of
the
room
somehow
and
back
to
barracks
and
we
breathed
on
the
window
and
made
a
place
through
which
we
watched
old
jack
over
the
campus
ploughing
back
to
jack
through
the
blizzard
so
you
see
things
like
that
make
us
lenient
to
old
jack
sometimes
though
he
is
awfully
dull
and
has
very
peculiar
notions
margaret
cleave
sat
up
is
that
you
richard
miriam
put
down
tabitha
and
rose
to
her
knees
did
you
see
cousin
judith
is
she
as
beautiful
as
ever
will
hospitably
gave
up
the
big
chair
you
must
have
galloped
dundee
both
ways
did
you
ask
about
the
shotgun
cleave
took
his
seat
at
the
foot
of
his
mother
couch
yes
will
you
may
have
fauquier
sent
his
love
to
you
mother
and
to
miriam
they
leave
for
greenwood
and
cousin
judith
persisted
miriam
what
did
she
have
on
did
she
sing
to
you
cleave
picked
up
her
fallen
book
and
smoothed
the
leaves
she
was
not
there
the
silver
hill
people
had
taken
her
for
the
night
i
passed
them
on
the
road
there
be
thick
ice
will
if
this
weather
lasts
later
when
had
been
said
and
he
was
alone
in
his
bare
room
he
looked
not
at
his
law
books
nor
at
the
words
left
lying
on
the
table
but
he
drew
a
chair
before
the
fireplace
and
from
its
depths
he
raised
his
eyes
to
his
sword
slung
above
the
he
sat
there
long
with
the
sword
before
him
then
he
rose
took
a
book
from
the
case
trimmed
the
candles
and
for
an
hour
read
of
the
campaigns
of
fabius
and
hannibal
chapter
iv
greenwood
the
april
sunshine
streaming
in
at
the
long
windows
filled
the
greenwood
with
dreamy
gold
it
lit
the
ancient
where
the
shepherds
and
shepherdesses
wooed
between
garlands
of
roses
and
it
aided
the
tone
of
time
among
the
portraits
the
boughs
of
peach
and
cherry
blossoms
in
the
old
potpourri
jars
made
it
welcome
and
the
dark
waxed
floor
let
it
lie
in
faded
pools
miss
lucy
cary
was
glad
to
see
it
as
she
sat
by
the
fire
knitting
fine
white
wool
into
a
sacque
for
a
baby
there
was
a
fire
of
hickory
but
it
burned
low
as
though
it
knew
the
winter
was
over
the
knitter
needles
glinted
in
the
sunshine
she
was
and
unmarried
and
it
was
her
delight
to
make
beautiful
soft
little
sacques
and
shoes
and
coverlets
for
every
actual
or
prospective
baby
in
all
the
wide
circle
of
her
kindred
and
friends
a
tap
at
the
door
and
the
old
greenwood
butler
entered
with
the
miss
lucy
laying
down
her
knitting
took
it
from
him
with
eager
fingers
a
la
in
eighteen
hundred
and
she
untied
the
string
emptied
letters
and
papers
upon
the
table
beside
her
and
began
to
sort
them
julius
a
spare
and
venerable
piece
of
ebony

autocrat
of
exquisite
manners
and
great
family
pride
stood
back
a
little
and
waited
for
directions
miss

taking
up
one
after

the
contents
of
the

made
her
comments
half
aloud

an
intense
and
chivalric
devotion

for
years
his
sister

taken
the
head
of
his
table
and
cared
like
a
mother
for
his
children
she
sat
now
at
work
beneath
the
portrait
of
her
own
mother
as
good
as
gold
as
true
as
steel
and
active
capable
and
of
a
sunny
humour
she
kept
her
place
in
the
hearts
of
all
who
knew
her
not
a
great
beauty
as
had
been
her
mother
she
was

a
handsome
woman
clear
brunette
with
bright
dark
eyes
and
a
most
likable
mouth

a
thing

the
way

young
people

enough
to
bring
down
a
judgment
upon
us
it
like
sir
walter
crying
bonny
to
the
jagged
lightnings
you
are
eighty
years
away
from
a
great
war
and
you
do
know
what
you
are
talking
about
and
may
you
never
be
any
nearer
yes
julius
that
all
tell
easter
jim
to
go
right
now
molly
this
is
the
island
and
here

fort
moultrie
and
here
fort
sumter
i
used
to
know
charleston
when
i
was
a
girl
i
can
see
now
the
battery
and
the
blue
sky
and
the
roses
and
the
roses
she
took
up
her
knitting
and
made
a
few
stitches
mechanically
then
laid
it
down
and
applied
herself
to
fauquier
cary
letter
molly
ensconced
in
a
window
was
already
busy
with
her
own
presently
she
spoke
miriam
cleave
says
that
will
passed
his
examination
higher
than
any
one
that
is
good
said
miss
lucy
they
all
have
fine
minds
the
cleaves
what
else
does
she
say
she
says
that
richard
has
given
her
a
silk
dress
for
her
birthday
and
she
going
to
have
it
made
with
angel
sleeves
and
wear
a
hoop
with
it
she
sixteen
just
like
me
richard
a
good
brother
she
says
that
richard
has
gone
to
richmond
something
about
arms
for
his
company
of
volunteers
aunt
lucy
yes
dear
i
think
that
richard
loves
judith
molly
molly
stop
romancing
i
am
not
romancing
i
do
believe
in
it
that
week
last
summer
he
used
to
watch
her
and
stafford
and
there
was
a
look
in
his
eyes
like
the
knight
in
the
molly
molly
and
everybody
knew
that
stafford
was
a
suitor
knew
it
easter
told
me
and
everybody
thought
that
judith
was
going
to
make
him
happy
only
she
does
seem
to
have
done
so
at
least
not
yet
and
there
was
the
big
tournament
and
richard
and
dundee
took
all
the
rings
though
i
know
that
stafford
had
expected
to
and
judith
let
richard
crown
her
queen
but
she
looked
just
as
pale
and
still
and
richard
had
a
line
between
his
brows
and
i
think
he
thought
she
would
rather
have
had
the
maid
of
honour
crown
that
stafford
won
and
gave
to
just
a
little
girl
molly
i
am
going
to
lock
up
every
poetry
book
in
the
house
and
that
was
one
day
and
the
next
morning
richard
looked
stern
and
fine
and
rode
away
he
is
really
handsome
not
like
edward
that
is
only
he
has
a
way
of
looking
so
and
judith
molly
you
uncanny
i
not
uncanny
i
ca
help
seeing
and
the
night
after
the
tournament
i
slept
in
judith
room
and
i
woke
up
three
times
and
each
time
there
was
judith
still
sitting
in
the
window
in
the
moonlight
and
the
roses
richard
had
crowned
her
with
beside
her
in
lowestoft
bowl
and
each
time
i
asked
her
do
you
come
to
bed
judith
and
each
time
she
said
not
sleepy
then
in
the
morning
richard
rode
away
and
the
next
day
was
sunday
and
judith
went
to
church
both
morning
and
evening
and
that
night
she
took
so
long
to
say
her
prayers
she
must
have
been
praying
for
the
whole
world
miss
lucy
rose
with
energy
stop
molly
i
should
have
let
you
ever
begin
it
not
kind
to
watch
people
like
that
i
was
watching
judith
said
molly
i
scorn
to
do
such
a
thing
i
was
just
seeing
and
i
never
said
a
word
about
her
and
richard
until
this
instant
when
the
sunshine
came
in
somehow
and
started
it
and
i
do
know
that
she
likes
richard
any
more
i
think
she
trying
hard
to
like
stafford
he
wants
her
to
so
much
stop
talking
honey
and
do
have
so
many
fancies
and
do
read
so
much
poetry
who
is
it
coming
up
the
drive
it
wood
on
his
old
grey
horse
like
a
nice
quiet
knight
out
of
the
queen
did
you
ever
notice
aunt
lucy
how
everybody
really
belongs
in
a
book
on
the
old
broad
pillared
porch
the
two
found
the
second
miss
cary
and
young
hairston
breckinridge
apparently
in
training
the
roses
they
had
discovered
a
thorn
they
sat
in
silence
at
opposite
sides
of
the
steps
nursing
the
recollection
breckinridge
regarded
the
toe
of
his
boot
unity
the
distant
blue
ridge
until
corbin
wood
and
his
grey
horse
coming
into
view
between
the
oaks
they
regarded
him
the
air
said
miss
lucy
from
the
doorway
is
turning
cold
what
did
you
fall
out
about
south
carolina
answered
unity
with
serenity
it
not
unlikely
that
our
grandchildren
will
be
falling
out
about
south
carolina
breckinridge
is
a
democrat
and
a
anyhow
virginia
is
not
going
to
secede
just
because
he
wants
her
to
the
angry
young
disciple
of
calhoun
opposite
was
moved
to
reply
but
at
that
moment
corbin
wood
arriving
before
the
steps
he
must
perforce
run
down
to
greet
him
and
help
him
dismount
a
negro
had
hardly
taken
the
grey
and
wood
was
yet
speaking
to
the
ladies
upon
the
porch
when
two
other
horsemen
appeared
mounted
on
much
more
fiery
steeds
and
coming
at
a
gait
that
approached
the
ancient
planter
pace
edward
and
hilary
preston
said
miss
lucy
and
away
down
the
road
i
see
judith
and
mr
stafford
the
two
in
advance
riding
up
the
drive
beneath
the
mighty
oaks
and
dismounting
the
gravel
space
before
the
porch
became
a
scene
of
animation
with
beautiful
spirited
horses
leaping
dogs
negro
servants
and
gay
horsemen
edward
cary
sprang
up
the
steps
aunt
lucy
you
remember
hilary
preston
and
this
is
my
sister
unity
preston
the
quakeress
we
call
her
and
this
is
molly
the
little
one
mr
wood
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
sir
aunt
lucy
virginia
page
the
two
masons
and
nancy
carter
are
coming
over
after
supper
with
cousin
william
and
i
fancy
that
peyton
and
dabney
and
rives
and
lee
will
arrive
about
the
same
time
we
might
have
a
little
dance
eh
here
stafford
with
judith
now
in
the
greenwood
after
they
had
the
little
dance
negro
fiddlers
two
of
them
born
musicians
came
from
the
quarter
they
were
dressed
in
an
elaborate
best
they
were
as
suavely
happy
as
tropical
children
and
beamingly
eager
for
the
credit
in
the
dance
as
in
all
things
else
of
de
fambly
down
came
the
bow
upon
the
strings
out
upon
the
april
night
floated
money
musk
all
the
furniture
was
pushed
aside
the
polished
floor
gave
back
the
lights
from
the
walls
men
and
women
of
the
past
smiled
upon
a
stage
they
no
longer
trod
and
between
garlands
of
roses
the
shepherds
and
shepherdesses
pursued
their
long
long
courtship
the
night
was
mild
the
windows
partly
open
the
young
girls
dancing
in
gowns
of
summery
stuff
their
very
wide
skirts
were
printed
over
with
pale
flowers
their
bodices
were
cut
low
with
a
fall
of
lace
against
the
white
bosom
the
hair
was
worn
smooth
and
drawn
over
the
ear
with
on
either
side
a
bright
cluster
of
blossoms
the
fiddlers
played
malbrook
guerre
laughter
quick
and
gay
or
low
and
ripplingly
sweet
flowed
through
the
old
room
the
dances
were
all
square
for
there
existed
in
the
country
a
prejudice
against
round
dancing
once
edward
cary
pushed
a
friend
down
on
the
piano
stool
and
whirled
with
nancy
carter
into
the
middle
of
the
room
in
a
waltz
but
miss
lucy
shook
her
head
at
her
nephew
and
cousin
william
gazed
sternly
at
nancy
and
the
fiddlers
looked
scandalized
scipio
the
old
old
one
who
could
remember
the
lafayette
ball
held
his
bow
awfully
poised
judith
cary
dressed
in
a
soft
strange
dull
blue
and
wearing
a
little
crown
of
rosy
flowers
danced
along
like
the
lady
of
saint
agnes
eve
maury
stafford
marked
how
absent
was
her
gaze
and
he
hoped
that
she
was
dreaming
of
their
ride
that
afternoon
of
the
clear
green
woods
and
the
dogwood
stars
and
of
some
words
that
he
had
said
in
these
days
he
was
hoping
against
hope
well
off
and
good
to
look
at
pleasant
of
speech
at
times
indolent
at
times
ardent
a
little
silent
on
the
whole
and
never
failing
to
match
the
occasion
with
just
the
right
shade
of
intelligence
a
certain
grip
and
essence
in
this
man
made
itself
felt
like
the
firm
bed
of
a
river
beneath
the
flowing
water
he
was
not
of
albemarle
he
was
of
a
county
but
he
came
to
albemarle
and
stayed
with
kindred
and
no
one
doubted
that
he
strove
for
an
albemarle
bride
it
was
the
opinion
of
the
county
people
that
he
would
win
her
it
was
hard
to
see
why
he
should
not
he
was
desperately
in
love
and
far
too
determined
to
take
the
first
no
for
an
answer
until
the
last
eight
months
it
had
been
his
own
conclusion
that
he
would
win
the
old
clock
in
the
hall
struck
ten
in
an
interval
between
the
dances
judith
slipped
away
stafford
wished
to
follow
her
but
cousin
william
held
him
like
the
ancient
mariner
and
talked
of
the
long
past
on
the
eastern
shore
judith
entering
the
library
came
upon
the
reverend
corbin
wood
deep
in
a
great
chair
and
a
volume
come
in
come
in
judith
my
dear
and
tell
me
about
the
dance
it
is
a
pretty
dance
said
judith
do
you
think
it
would
be
very
wrong
of
you
to
watch
it
wood
the
long
thin
fingers
of
one
hand
lightly
touching
the
long
thin
fingers
of
the
other
hand
considered
the
matter
why
no
he
said
in
a
mellow
and
genial
voice
why
no
it
is
always
hard
for
me
to
think
that
anything
beautiful
is
wrong
it
is
this
way
i
go
into
the
and
watch
you
it
is
as
you
say
a
very
pretty
sight
but
if
i
find
it
so
and
still
keep
a
long
face
i
am
to
myself
something
of
a
hypocrite
and
if
i
testify
my
delight
if
i
am
absorbed
in
your
evolutions
and
think
only
of
springtime
and
growing
things
and
show
my
thought
then
to
every
one
of
you
and
indeed
to
myself
too
my
dear
i
am
something
out
of
my
character
so
it
seems
better
to
sit
here
and
read
jeremy
taylor
you
have
the
book
upside
down
said
judith
softly
her
old
friend
put
on
his
glasses
gravely
looked
and
reversed
the
volume
he
laughed
and
then
he
sighed
i
was
thinking
of
the
country
judith
it
the
only
book
that
is
interesting
now
and
the
recital
tragic
my
dear
the
recital
tragic
from
the
hall
came
edward
cary
voice
judith
judith
we
want
you
for
the
reel
in
the
the
music
quickened
scipio
played
with
all
his
soul
his
eyes
uprolled
his
lips
parted
his
woolly
head
nodding
his
vast
foot
beating
time
young
eli
black
and
shining
seconded
him
ably
without
the
doors
and
windows
gathered
the
house
servants
absorbed
admiring
laughing
without
noise
the
april
wind
fragrant
of
greening
forests
ploughed
land
and
fruit
trees
blew
in
and
out
the
long
thin
curtains
faster
went
the
bow
upon
the
fiddle
the
room
became
more
brilliant
and
more
dreamy
the
flowers
in
the
old
old
blue
jars
grew
pinker
mistier
the
lights
had
halos
the
portraits
smiled
forthright
but
from
greater
distances
the
loud
ticking
of
the
clock
without
the
door
changed
to
a
great
rhythm
as
though
time
were
using
a
violin
string
the
laughter
swelled
waves
of
brightness
went
through
the
ancient
room
they
danced
the

a
smile

thought
but
that
not
possible
miss
lucy
half
rose
then
took
her
seat
again
cousin
william
listened
the
air
very
clear
and
there
must
be
an
echo
it
does
sound
like
a
great
body
of
horsemen
coming
out
of
the
distance
balance
corners
called
eli
swing
yo
partners
the
music
drew
to
a
height
the
lights
burned
with
a
fuller
power
the
odour
of
the
flowers
spread
subtle
and
intense
the
dancers
moved
more
and
more
quickly
there
are
only
three
horses
said
cousin
william
two
in
front
and
one
behind
two
gentlemen
and
a
servant

the
little
bridge

excited
and
joyous
barking

the
reel
ended
suddenly
there
was
a
sound
of
dismounting
a
step
upon
the
porch
a
voice
father
father
cried
judith
and
ran
into
the
hall
a
minute
later
the
master
of
greenwood
his
children
about
him
entered
the
behind
him
came
richard
cleave
there
was
a
momentary
confusion
of
greeting
it
passed
and
from
the
two
men
fatigued
pale
with
some
suppressed
emotion
there
sped
to
the
gayer
company
a
subtle
wave
of
expectation
and
alarm
miss
lucy
was
the
first
whom
it
reached
what
is
it
brother
she
said
quickly
cousin
william
followed
for
god
sake
cary
what
has
happened
edward
spoke
from
beside
the
piano
has
it
come
father
with
his
words
his
hand
fell
upon
the
keys
suddenly
and
startlingly
upon
the
bass
the
vibrations
died
away
yes
it
has
come
edward
said
the
master
holding
up
his
hand
for
silence
he
moved
to
the
middle
of
the
room
and
stood
there
beneath
the
lit
candles
the
swinging
prisms
of
the
chandelier
peale
portrait
of
his
father
hung
upon
the
wall
the
resemblance
was
strong
between
the
dead
and
the
living
be
quiet
every
one
he
said
now
speaking
very
quietly
himself
is
all
the
household
here
open
the
window
wide
julius
let
the
house
servants
come
inside
if
there
are
men
and
women
from
the
quarter
on
the
porch
tell
them
to
come
closer
so
that
all
may
hear
julius
opened
the
long
windows
the
negroes
came
in
mammy
in
her
turban
easter
and
chloe
the
seamstresses
the
cook
the
housemaids
the
boys
the
young
girls
who
waited
upon
the
daughters
of
the
house
isham
the
coachman
shirley
the
master
boy
jeames
and
the
nondescript
half
dozen
who
helped
the
others
the
ruder
sort
upon
the
porch
outdoor
negroes
drawn
by
the
music
and
the
spectacle
from
the
quarter
approached
the
windows
together
they
made
a
background
dark
and
exotic
splashed
with
bright
colour
for
the
aryan
stock
ranged
to
the
front
the
was
filled
corbin
wood
had
come
noiselessly
in
from
the
library
none
was
missing
guests
family
and
servants
stood
motionless
there
was
that
in
the
bearing
of
the
master
which
seemed
in
the
silence
to
detach
itself
and
to
come
toward
them
like
an
emanation
cold
pure
and
quiet
determined
and
imposing
he
spoke
i
supposed
that
you
had
heard
the
news
along
the
railroad
and
in
charlottesville
it
was
known
there
were
great
crowds
i
see
it
has
not
reached
you
lincoln
has
called
for
thousand
troops
with
which
to
procure
south
carolina
and
the
gulf
states
return
into
the
union
he
the
north
demands
of
virginia
eight
thousand
men
to
be
used
for
this
purpose
she
will
not
give
them
we
have
fought
long
and
patiently
for
peace
now
we
fight
no
more
on
that
field
matters
have
brought
me
for
a
few
hours
to
albemarle
i
return
to
richmond
to
the
convention
to
do
that
which
i
never
thought
to
do
to
give
my
voice
for
the
secession
of
virginia
there
was
a
general
movement
throughout
the
room
so
said
corbin
wood
very
softly
cousin
william
rose
from
the
sofa
drew
a
long
breath
and
smote
his
hands
together
it
had
to
come
cary
it
had
to
come
north
and
south
we
pulled
in
different
directions
for
sixty
years
the
cord
had
to
snap
from
among
the
awed
servants
came
the
voice
of
old
isham
the
coachman
what
dat
wuhd
marster
that
word
answered
warwick
cary
means
isham
that
virginia
leaves
of
her
free
will
a
union
that
she
entered
of
her
free
will
the
terms
of
that
union
have
been
broken
she
can
not
within
it
preserve
her
integrity
her
dignity
and
her
liberty
therefore
she
uses
the
right
which
she
reserved
the
right
of
unterrified
she
entered
the
union
unterrified
she
leaves
it
he
paused
standing
in
the
white
light
of
the
candles
among
his
children
kinsmen
friends
and
slaves
to
the
last
if
ingrained
affection
tolerance
and
understanding
quiet
guidance
patient
care
a
kindly
heart
a
ready
ear
a
wise
and
simple
dealing
with
a
simple
not
wise
folk
are
true
constituents
of
friendship
he
was
then
their
friend
as
well
as
their
master
they
with
all
the
room
hung
now
upon
his
words
the
light
wind
blew
the
curtains
out
like
streamers
the
candles
flickered
petals
from
the
blossoms
in
the
jars
fell
on
the
floor
the
clock
that
had
ticked
in
the
hall
for
a
hundred
years
struck
eleven
there
will
be
war
said
the
master
there
should
not
be
but
there
will
be
how
long
it
will
last
how
deadly
its
nature
no
man
can
tell
the
north
has
not
thought
us
in
earnest
but
the
north
is
mistaken
we
are
in
earnest
war
will
be
for
us
a
desperate
thing
we
are
utterly
unprepared
we
are
seven
million
against
twenty
million
an
agricultural
country
against
a
manufacturing
one
we
have
little
shipping
they
have
much
they
will
gain
command
of
the
sea
if
we
can
get
our
cotton
to
europe
we
will
have
gold
therefore
if
they
can
block
our
ports
they
will
do
it
there
are
those
who
think
the
powers
will
intervene
and
that
we
will
have
england
or
france
for
our
ally
i
am
not
of
them
the
odds
are
greatly
against
us
we
have
struggled
for
peace
apparently
we
can
not
have
it
now
we
will
fight
for
the
conviction
that
is
in
us
it
will
be
for
us
a
war
of
defence
with
the
north
for
the
invader
and
virginia
will
prove
the
i
hold
it
very
probable
that
there
are
men
here
who
will
die
in
battle
you
women
are
going
to
suffer
to
suffer
more
than
we
i
think
of
my
mother
and
of
my
wife
and
i
know
that
you
will
neither
hold
us
back
nor
murmur
all
that
is
courageous
all
that
is
heroically
devoted
virginia
expects
and
will
receive
from
you
he
turned
to
face
more
fully
the
crowding
negroes
to
every
man
and
woman
of
you
here
not
the
less
my
friends
that
you
are
called
my
servants
emancipated
at
my
death
every
one
of
you
by
that
will
which
i
read
to
you
years

each
of
you
having
long

came
the
of
the
guests
of
all
who
were
not
to
sleep
that
night
at
greenwood
maury
stafford
was
to
stay
and
corbin
wood
of
those
going
cousin
william
was
the
only
one
of
years
the
others
were
all
young
young
men
young
women
on
the
edge
of
an
experience
on
the
brink
of
a
bitter
tempestuous
wintry
sea
they
did
not
see
it
so
there
was
danger
of
course
but
they
thought
of
splendour
and
heroism
of
trumpet
calls
and
waving
banners
they
were
much
excited
the
young
girls
half
frightened
the
men
wild
to
be
at
home
with
plans
for
volunteering
and
and
again
and
when
it
all
over
it
will
be
over
in
three
months
will
it
not
sir
we
finish
the
reel
the
large
old
coach
and
the
saddle
horses
were
brought
around
they
drove
or
rode
away
through
the
april
night
by
the
forsythia
and
the
flowering
almond
between
the
towering
oaks
over
the
bridge
with
a
hollow
sound
those
left
behind
upon
the
greenwood
porch
clustered
at
the
top
of
the
steps
between
the
white
pillars
stood
in
silence
until
the
noise
of
departure
had
died
away

his
arm
around

in

cheek
resting
against
his
shoulder
then
spoke
it
is
the
last
poor
children
well
and
tide
run
through
the
longest
day
he
disengaged
himself
kissed
each
of
his
daughters
and
turned
toward
the
lighted
hall
there
are
papers
in
the
library
which
i
must
go
over
edward
you
had
best
come
with
me
father
and
son
left
the
porch
miss
lucy
too
went
indoors
called
julius
and
began
to
give
directions
ready
and
energetic
she
never
wasted
time
in
wonder
at
events
the
event
once
squarely
met
she
struck
immediately
into
the
course
it
demanded
cheerfully
without
repining
and
with
as
little
attention
as
possible
to
forebodings
her
voice
died
away
toward
the
back
of
the
house
the
moon
was
shining
and
the
lawn
lay
chequered
beneath
the
trees
corbin
wood
who
had
been
standing
in
a
brown
study
began
to
descend
the
steps
i
take
a
little
walk
judith
my
dear
he
said
and
think
it
over
i
let
myself
in
he
was
gone
walking
rapidly
not
toward
the
big
gate
and
the
road
but
across
to
the
fields
a
little
stream
and
a
strip
that
had
been
left
of
primeval
forest
unity
and
molly
moving
back
to
the
doorstep
sat
there
whispering
together
in
the
light
from
the
hall
judith
and
richard
were
left
almost
alone
judith
leaning
against
a
white
pillar
cleave
standing
a
step
or
two
below
her
you
have
been
in
richmond
she
said
molly
had
a
letter
from
miriam
yes
i
went
to
find
if
possible
rifled
muskets
for
my
company
i
did
not
do
as
well
as
i
had
hoped
the
supply
is
dreadfully
small
but
i
secured
a
few
two
thirds
of
us
will
have
to
manage
until
we
can
do
better
with
the
smoothbore
and
even
with
the
old
flintlock
i
have
seen
a
made
in
the
north
i
wish
to
god
we
had
it
you
are
going
back
to
botetourt
as
soon
as
it
is
dawn
the
company
will
at
once
offer
its
services
to
the
governor
every
moment
now
is
important
at
dawn
you
will
be
its
captain
i
suppose
so
we
will
hold
immediately
an
election
of
officers
and
that
as
pernicious
a
method
of
officering
companies
and
regiments
as
can
be
imagined
are
volunteers
offering
all
they
can
be
trusted
to
choose
their
leaders
i
do
perceive
the
sequence
i
think
that
you
will
make
a
good
captain
he
smiled
why
then
the
clumsy
thing
will
work
for
once
i
try
to
be
a
good
the
clock
is
striking
i
do
not
know
when
nor
how
i
shall
see
greenwood
again
judith
you
wish
me
well
will
i
wish
you
well
richard
yes
i
will
wish
you
well
do
not
go
at
dawn
he
looked
at
her
do
you
ask
me
to
wait
yes
i
ask
you
wait
till
till
later
in
the
morning
it
is
so
sad
to
say
i
will
wait
then
the
light
from
the
hall
lay
unbroken
on
the
doorstep
molly
and
unity
had
disappeared
a
little
in
yellow
lamplight
chiefly
in
silver
moonlight
the
porch
lay
deserted
and
quiet
before
the
murmuring
oaks
above
the
fair
downward
sweep
of
grass
and
flowers
it
is
long
said
cleave
since
i
have
been
here
the
day
after
the
tournament
yes
he
came
nearer
judith
was
it
so
hard
to
forgive
that
tournament
you
had
both
crowns
after
all
i
do
not
know
said
judith
what
you
mean
do
you
remember
do
you
remember
last
christmas
when
going
to
lauderdale
i
passed
you
on
your
way
to
silver
hill
yes
i
remember
i
was
on
my
way
to
lauderdale
not
to
see
fauquier
but
to
see
you
i
wished
to
ask
you
a
question
i
wished
to
make
certain
and
then
you
passed
me
going
to
silver
hill
and
i
said
is
certainly
so
i
have
believed
it
to
be
so
i
believe
it
now
and
yet
i
ask
you
judith
you
ask
me
what
said
judith
here
is
mr
stafford
maury
stafford
came
into
the
silver
space
before
the
house
glanced
upward
and
mounted
the
steps
i
walked
as
far
as
the
gate
with
breckinridge
he
tells
me
cleave
that
he
is
of
your
company
of
volunteers
yes
i
shall
turn
my
face
toward
the
sea
heigho
war
is
folly
at
the
best
and
you
i
leave
greenwood
in
the
morning
the
other
leaning
against
a
pillar
drew
toward
him
a
branch
of
climbing
rose
the
light
from
the
hall
struck
against
him
he
always
achieved
the
looking
as
though
he
had
stepped
from
out
a
this
was
strongly
so
in
the
morning
you
waste
no
time
unfortunately
i
can
not
get
away
for
another
hours
he
let
the
rose
bough
go
and
turned
to
judith
his
voice
when
he
spoke
to
her
became
at
once
low
and
musical
there
was
light
enough
to
see
the
flush
in
his
cheek
the
ardour
in
his
eye
what
a
word
to
use
in
leaving
greenwood
no
for
me
most
fortunately
i
must
wait
another
four
and
twenty
hours
greenwood
said
judith
will
be
lonely
without
old
friends
as
she
spoke
she
moved
toward
the
house
door
in
passing
a
great
porch
chair
her
dress
caught
on
the
twisted
wood
both
men
started
forward
but
stafford
was
much
the
nearer
to
her
released
she
thanked
him
with
grave
kindness
went
on
to
the
doorway
and
there
turned
standing
a
moment
in
her
drapery
of
dim
blue
in
the
two
lights
she
had
about
her
a
long
scarf
of
black
lace
and
now
she
drew
it
closer
holding
it
beneath
her
chin
with
a
hand
slender
fine
and
strong
she
said
it
is
not
long
to
morning
now
stafford
richard
the
that
stafford
breathed
after
her
needed
no
commentary
it
was
that
of
the
lover
confessed
cleave
from
his
side
of
the
porch
looked
across
and
thought
i
will
be
a
fool
no
longer
she
was
merely
kind
to
me
a
kindness
she
could
afford
not
go
till
morning
there
was
a
silence
on
the
greenwood
porch
a
space
paced
ere
this
by
lovers
and
rivals
it
was
broken
by
corbin
wood
returning
from
the
fields
and
mounting
the
moonlit
steps
i
have
thought
it
out
he
said
i
am
going
as
chaplain
he
touched
stafford
of
whom
he
was
fond
on
the
shoulder
it
the
sweetest
night
and
as
i
came
along
i
loved
every
leaf
of
the
trees
and
every
blade
of
grass
it
home
it
fatherland
it
sacred
soil
mother
dear
virginia
he
broke
off
said
and
entered
the
house
the
younger
men
prepared
to
follow
the
next
time
that
we
meet
said
stafford
may
be
in
the
thunder
of
the
fight
i
have
an
idea
that
know
it
if
you
there
i
look
out
for
you
and
i
for
you
said
cleave
each
had
spoken
with
entire
courtesy
and
a
marked
lack
of
amity
there
was
a
moment
pause
a
feeling
as
of
the
edge
of
things
cleave
not
tall
but
strongly
made
with
his
thick
dark
hair
his
tanned
clean
shaven
squarely
cut
face
stood
very
straight
in
earnest
and
formidable
the
other
leaning
against
the
pillar
was
the
fairer
to
look
at
and
certainly
not
without
his
own
strength
the
one
thought
i
will
know
and
the
other
thought
i
believe
you
to
be
my
foe
of
foes
if
i
can
make
you
leave
this
place
early
without
speaking
to
her
i
will
do
it
cleave
turned
squarely
you
have
reason
to
regret
leaving
greenwood
stafford
straightened
himself
against
the
pillar
studied
for
a
moment
the
seal
ring
which
he
wore
then
spoke
with
deliberation
yes
it
is
hard
to
quit
paradise
for
even
such
a
tourney
as
we
have
before
us
ah
well
when
one
comes
riding
back
the
welcome
will
be
the
sweeter
they
went
indoors
later
alone
in
a
pleasant
bedroom
the
man
who
had
put
a
face
upon
matters
which
the
facts
did
not
justify
opened
wide
the
window
and
looked
out
upon
hill
and
vale
do
i
despise
myself
he
thought
if
it
was
false
i
may
yet
make
it
truth
all
fair
in
love
and
war
and
god
knows
my
all
is
in

war

he
stared
into
the
night
moodily
enough
his
room
was
at
the
side
of
the
house
below
lay
a
slope
of
flower
garden
then
a
meadow
a
little
stream
and
beyond

by

on

a
part
of
the
april
night
crouching
there
in
the
scented
air
beneath
the
large
mild
stars
she
tried
to
think
of
virginia
and
the
coming
war
but
at
the
end
of
every
avenue
she
came
upon
a
morning
hour
perhaps
it
would
be
in
the
flower
garden
perhaps
in
the
perhaps
in
the
plantation
woods
where
the
windflower
and
the
judas
tree
were
in

her
heart
was
hopeful
so
lifted
and
swept

the
world
so
ready
for
great
things
that
her
great
thing
also
ought
to
happen

of

said
to
herself

lodged
at
the
tollgate
halfway
down
the
mountain
his
parents
were
dead
his
brothers
moved
away
the
mountain
girls
were
pretty
and
fain
and
matches
were
early
made
allan
made
none
he
taught
with
conscientiousness
thirty
youngsters
read
what
books
he
could
get
and
worked
in
the
tollgate
keeper
small
bright
garden
he
had
a
passion
for
flowers
he
loved
too
to
sit
with
his
pipe
upon
the
rude
porch
of
the
fanned
by
the
marvellous
mountain
air
and
look
down
over
ridges
of
chestnut
and
oak
to
the
mighty
valley
below
and
across
to
the
far
blue
wall
of
the
alleghenies
the
schoolhouse
stood
a
mile
from
the
road
across
the
mountains
upon
a
higher
level
in
a
fairy
meadow
below
the
mountain
clearings
a
walnut
tree
shaded
it
thunder

leaped
by
in
cascades
on
either
side
the
footpath
allan
had
planted
larkspur
and
marigolds
here
on
a
may
morning
he
rang
the
bell
then
waited
patiently
until
the
last
imp
elected
to
leave
the
delights
of
a
pool
a
newly
discovered
redbird
nest
and
a
blockhouse
in
process
of
construction
against
imaginary
indians
at
last
all
were
seated
upon
the
rude
benches
in
the
dusky
room
small
jacks
and
jills
heirs
to
a
field
of
wheat
or
oats
a
diminutive
tobacco
patch
a
log
cabin
a
piece
of
uncleared
forest
or
perhaps
the
blacksmith
forge
a
small
mountain
store
or
the
sawmill
down
the
stream
allan
read
aloud
the
parable
of
the
sower
and
they
all
said
the
lord
prayer
then
he
called
the
blue
back
speller
class
the
spelling
done
they
read
from
the
same
book
about
the
martyr
and
his
family
geography
followed
with
an
account
of
the
and
an
illustration
of
a
pagoda
after
which
the
took
the
front
bench
and
read
of
little
hugh
and
old
toil
this
over
the
whole
school
fell
to
ciphering
they
ciphered
for
half
an
hour
and
then
they
had
a
history
lesson
which
told
of
one
curtius
who
leaped
into
a
gulf
to
save
his
country
history
being
followed
by
the
writing
lesson
all
save
the
littlest
present
began
laboriously
to
copy
a
proverb
of
solomon
eleven
and
recess
drawing
on
the
scholars
grew
restless
could
the
bird
nest
still
be
there
were
the
minnows
gone
from
the
pool
had
the
blockhouse
fallen
down
would
writing
go
on
forever
the
bell
rang
the
teacher
whom
they
liked
well
enough
was
speaking
more
school
recess
forever
or
until
next
year
which
was
the
same
thing
no
more
geography
reading
writing
arithmetic
and
spelling
no
more
school
hurrah
of
course
the
redbird
nest
was
swinging
on
the
bough
and
the
minnows
were
in
the
pool
and
the
blockhouse
was
standing
and
the
sun
shining
with
all
its
might

i
marked
the
place
he
left
his
rude
old
desk
and
the
little
platform
and
stepping
down
amongst
his
pupils
gave
to
each
his
hand
then
he
divided
among
them
the
scanty
supply
of
books
patiently
answered
a
scurry
of
questions
and
outside
upon
the
sunshiny
sward
with
the
wind
in
the
walnut
tree
and
the
larkspur

up

along

leaped
from

but
one
party
party
of
the
a
month
ago
there
was
division
of
opinion
it
does
not
exist
it
died
in
the
hour
when
we
were
called
upon
to
deny
our
convictions
to
sacrifice
our
principles
to
juggle
with
the
constitution
to
play
fast
and
loose
to
blow
hot
and
cold
to
say
one
thing
and
do
another
to
fling
our
honour
to
the
winds
and
to
assist
in
coercing
sovereign
states
back
into
a
union
which
they
find
intolerable
it
died
in
the
moment
when
we
saw
no
longer
the
confederation
of
republics
to
which
we
had
acceded
but
a
land
whirling
toward
empire
it
is
dead

took
his

beat
a

upon

sunken
floor
his

blue
eyes
set
in
a
thousand
wrinkles
stared
down
upon

across
the
great
view
of

seated
herself
not

waved
her
but
upon
the
edge
of
the

with
her
back
to

and
the
heartsease
at
her
feet
ran
together
into
a
little
sea
of
purple
and
gold
she
took
the
cape
of
her
sunbonnet
and
with
it
wiped
away
the
unaccustomed
tears

a
coloured
handkerchief
and
drew
from

a
little
bag
of
flowered
chintz
roses
and
tulips
drawn
up
with
a
blue
ribbon
my
that
pretty
exclaimed
sairy

with
soft
pride
last

bucket
o
blackberries
down
to
three
oaks
an
sold
them
to

for
her
tester

an
i

a
big
piece
an
i
put
it
away
in
my
picture
box
with
my
glass
beads
for
the
ribbon
i
saved
a
little
my
berry
money
an
i
walked
to
buchanan
an
bought
it
she
drew
a
long
breath
my
land
was
fine
in
the
town
high
street
just
crowded
with
volunteers
and
the
drums
were
beating
her
eyes
shone
like
stars
it
right
hard
on
women
to
stay
at
home
an
have
all
the
excitement

away
there

seem
to
be
nothin
to
make

little
pair
of
scissors

but
i
did

right
useful
i
reckon
to
a
soldier
but
i

get
them
i
wondered
if
the
bag
ought
to
be
smaller
but
he
have
room
for
it
i
reckon

it
right
pretty
old
tom
cole
leaned
over
took
the
tiny
flowery
affair
and
balanced
it
gently
upon
a
horny
hand
of
course
he
have
room
for
it
an
jest
as
pretty
as
they
make
them
an
here
he
comes
now
down
the
mountain
to
thank
ye
himself
allan
gold
thanked
christianna
with
simplicity
he
had
never
had
so
pretty
a
thing
and
he
would
keep
it
always
and
every
time
he
looked
at
it
he
would
see
thunder
run
and
hear
the
bees
in
the
flowers
it
was
very
kind
of
her
to
make
it
for
him
and
and
he
would
keep
it
always
christianna
listened
and
then
with
her
eyes
upon
the
heartsease
began
to
say
in
her
soft
drawling
voice

a
pan
of
biscuits
for

in
her
hand
looked
after
them
there
a
deal
of
things

the
wagon
lumbered
down
the
springtime
road
and
the
man
on
horseback
followed
the
tollgate
keeper
hobbled
back
to
his
chair
and
sairy
returned
to
her
dinner
allan
was
going
away
and
she
was
making
gingerbread
because
he
liked
it
the
spicy
warm
fragrance
permeated
the
air
homely
and
pleasant
as
the
curl
of
blue
smoke
above
the
chimney
the
little
sunny
porch
the
buzzing
of
the
bees
in
the
lilacs
allan
now
said
tom
hey
allan

must
have
gone
a
good
bit
o
the
way
i
went
all
the
way
answered
allan
lifting
the
gourd
of
to
his
lips
poor
little
thing
she
is
breaking
her
heart
over
going
sairy
cutting
the
gingerbread
into
squares
held
the
knife
suspended
have
ye
been
talkin
about
billy
all
this
time
yes
said
allan
i
saw
that
she
was
unhappy
and
i
tried
to
cheer
her
up
i
look
out
for
the
boy
in
every
way
i
can
he
took
the
little
bag
of
chintz
from
the
bench
where
he
had
laid
it
when
he
went
with
christianna
and
turned
to
the
rude
stair
that
led
to
his
room
in
the
half
story
he
was
not
kin
to
the
tollgate
keepers
but
he
had
lived
long
with
them
and
was
very
fond
of
both
i
be
down
in
a
moment
aunt
sairy
he
said
i
wonder
when
i
smell
or
taste
your
gingerbread
again
and
i
do
see
how
i
am
going
to
tell
you
and
tom
he
was
gone
humming
annie
laurie
as
he
went
would
be
just
right
an
fittin
remarked
cole
if
half
the
men
in
the
world
went
about
with
a
piece
of
pasteboard
round
their
necks
an
written
on
it
the
blind
dinner
most
ready
tom
an
i
do
see
how
i
goin
to
tell
him
myself
an
hour
later
in
his
small
bare
room
underneath
the
mossy
roof
with
the
small
square
window
through
which
the
breezes
blew
allan
stood
and
looked
about
him
dinner
was
over
it
had
been
something
of
a
feast
with
unusual
dainties
and
a
bunch
of
lilacs
upon
the
table
sairy
had
on
a
sunday
apron
the
three
had
not
been
silent
either
they
had
talked
a
good
deal
but
without
much
thought
of
what
was
said
perhaps
it
was
because
of
this
that
the
meal
had
seemed
so
vague
and
that
nothing
had
left
a
taste
in
the
mouth
it
was
over
and
allan
was
making
ready
to
depart
on
the
floor
beside
the
chest
of
drawers
stood
a
small
hair
trunk
a
neighbour
with
a
road
wagon
had
offered
to
take
it
and
allan
too
down
the
mountain
at
three
in
the
spring
of
one
out
of
every
two
confederate
privates
had
a
trunk
one
must
preserve
the
decencies
of
life
one
must
make
a
good
appearance
in
the
field
allan
was
small
and
modest
enough
god
knows
but
such
as
it
was
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
to
doubt
the
propriety
of
taking
it
it
stood
there
neatly
packed
the
shirts
that
sairy
had
been
ironing
laid
atop
the
young
man
kneeling
beside
it
placed
in
this
or
that
corner
the
last
few
articles
of
his
outfit
all
was
simple
clean
and
new
only
the
books
that
he
was
taking
with
him
were
old
they
were
his
bible
his
shakespeare
a
volume
of
plutarch
lives
and
a
latin
book
or
two
beside
in
a
place
to
themselves
were
other
treasures
a
daguerreotype
of
his
mother
a
capacious
huswife
that
sairy
had
made
and
stocked
for
him
the
little
box
of
paper
to
write
home
on
that
had
been
tom
present
various
trifles
that
the
three
had
agreed
might
come
in
handy
among
these
he
now
placed
christianna
gift
it
was
soft
and
full
and
bright
he
had
the
same
pleasure
in
handling
it
that
he
would
have
felt
in
touching
a
damask
rose
he
shut
it
in
and
rose
from
his
knees
he
had
on
his
uniform
they
had
been
slow
in
coming
the
uniforms
from
richmond
it
was
only
cleave
patient
insistence
that
had
procured
them
at
last
some
of
the
companies
were
not
uniformed
at
all
so
enormous
was
the
press
of
business
upon
the
authorities
so
limited
was
the
power
of
an
almost
purely
agricultural
world
suddenly
to
clothe
alike
these
thousands
of
volunteers
suddenly
to
arm
them
with
something
better
than
a
or
a
revolutionary
flintlock
that
the
wonder
is
not
that
they
did
so
badly
but
that
they
did
so
well
pending
the
arrival
of
the
uniforms
the
men
had
drilled
in
strange
array
with
an
attempt
at
similarity
and
a
picturesque
taste
of
their
own
most
of
them
wore
linsey
shirts
and
big
black
hats
tucked
up
on
one
side
with
a
rosette
of
green
ribbon
one
man
donned
his
grandfather
continental
blue
and
buff
on
the
breast
was
a
dark
stain
won
at
king
mountain
others
drilled
and
were
now
ready
to
march
as
they
came
from
the
plough
the
mill
or
the
forge
but
cleave
company
by
virtue
of
cleave
himself
was
fairly
equipped
the
uniforms
had
come
and
there
was
a
decent
showing
of
modern
arms
billy
and
spear
would
be
changed
on
the
morrow
for
a
musket
though
in
billy
case
the
musket
would
certainly
be
the
old
smoothbore
calibre
allan
own
gun
left
him
by
his
father
rested
against
the
wall
the
young
man
for
all
his
quietude
his
conscientious
ways
his
daily
work
with
children
his
love
of
flowers
and
his
dreams
of
books
inherited
from
frontiersmen
whose
lives
had
depended
upon
watchfulness
quickness
of
wit
accuracy
of
eye
and
steadiness
of
aim
he
rarely
missed
his
mark
and
he
read
intuitively
and
easily
the
language
of
wood
sky
and
road
on
the
bed
lay
his
slouch
hat
his
haversack
knapsack
and
canteen
and
belt
and
slung
over
the
back
of
a
chair
was
his
roll
of
blanket
all
was
in
readiness
allan
went
over
to
the
window
below
him
were
the
flowers
he
had
tended
then
the
great
forests
in
their
may
freshness
cataracts
of
green
falling
down
down
to
the
valley
over
all
hung
the
sky
divinely
blue
a
wind
went
rustling
through
the
forest
joining
its
voice
to
the
voice
of
thunder
run
allan
knelt
touching
with
his
forehead
the
o
lord
god
he
said
o
lord
god
keep
us
all
north
and
south
and
bring
us
through
winding
ways
to
thy
end
at
last
as
he
rose
he
heard
the
wagon
coming
down
the
road
he
turned
put
the
roll
of
blanket
over
one
shoulder
and
beneath
the
other
arm
assumed
knapsack
haversack
and
canteen
dragged
the
hair
trunk
out
upon
the
landing
returned
took
up
his
musket
looked
once
again
about
the
small
familiar
room
then
left
it
and
went
downstairs
sairy
and
tom
were
upon
the
porch
the
owner
of
the
wagon
with
them
i
tote
down
yo
trunk
said
the
latter
and
presently
emerged
from
the
house
with
that
article
upon
his
shoulder
i
reckon
i
volunteer
myself
just
as
soon
harvest
over
he
remarked
genially
but
gosh
be
back
by
then
telling
how
you
did
it
he
went
down
the
path
whistling
and
tossed
the
trunk
into
the
wagon
i
hate
said
allan
i
wish
i
had
stolen
away
last
night
do
ye
get
killed
answered
sairy
sharply
that
what
i
afraid
of
i
know
you
go
riskin
yourself
god
bless
you
said
tom
you

like
a
son
to
us
these
five
years
do
you
forget
to
write
i
wo
answered
allan
i
write
you
long
letters
and
i
wo
get
killed
aunt
sairy
i
take
the
best
of
care
he
took
the
old
woman
in
his
arms
you
two
have
been
just
as
good
as
a
father
and
mother
to
me
thank
you
for
it
i
never
forget
toward
five
the
wagon
rolled
into
the
village
whence
certain
of
the
botetourt
companies
were
to
march
away
it
was
built
beside
the
river
two
long
parallel
streets
one
upon
the
water
level
the
other
much
higher
with
intersecting
lanes
there
were
brick
and
frame
houses
modest
enough
there
were
three
small
churches
many
locust
and
ailanthus
trees
a
covered
bridge
thrown
across
the
river
to
a
village
upon
the
farther
side
and
surrounding
all
a
noble
frame
of
mountains
there
was
in
those
days
no
railroad
cleave
hundred
men
having
the
town
at
large
for
their
friend
stood
in
no
lack
of
quarters
some
had
volunteered
from
this
place
or
its
neighbourhood
others
had
kinsmen
and
associates
not
one
was
so
forlorn
as
to
be
without
a
host
the
village
was
in
a
high
fever
of
hospitality
had
the
companies
marching
from
botetourt
been
so
many
brigades
it
would
still
have
done
its
utmost
from
the
potomac
to
the
dan
from
the
eastern
shore
to
the
alleghenies
the
flame
of
patriotism
burned
high
and
clear
there
were
skulkers
there
were
braggarts
there
were
knaves
and
fools
in
virginia
as
elsewhere
but
by
comparison
they
were
not
many
and
theirs
was
not
the
voice
that
was
heard
the
mass
of
the
people
were
very
honest
stubbornly
convinced
showing
to
the
end
a
most
heroic
and
devoted
ardour
this
village
was
not
behindhand
all
her
young
men
were
going
she
had
her
company
too
she
welcomed
men
gathered
for
the
momentarily
expected
order
to
the
front
and
lavished
upon
them
as
on
two
other
companies
within
her
bounds
every
hospitable
care
the
wagon
driver
deposited
allan
gold
and
his
trunk
before
the
porch
of
the
old
red
brick
hotel
shook
hands
with
a
mighty
grip
and
rattled
on
toward
the
lower
end
of
town
the
host
came
out
to
greet
the
young
man
two
negro
boys
laid
hold
of
his
trunk
a
passing
volunteer
in
butternut
with
a
musket
as
long
as
natty
bumpo
hailed
him
and
a
cluster
of
elderly
men
sitting
with
tilted
chairs
in
the
shade
of
a
locust
tree
rose
and
gave
him
welcome
it
allan
gold
from
thunder
run
is
it
sir
ca
have
too

going

be
a
parade
presently
an
hour
later
in
the
sunset
glow
in
a
meadow
by

the

paraded
the
new

the
bright

the
silken

the

playing

the

every

every

out

in

out
into

and
low
street
in
the
moonlight
under
the
odour
of
the
white
locust
clusters
the
churches
were
lit
and
open
in

there
was
brief
service
well
attended
later
from
the
porch
of
the
old
hotel
there
was
speaking
it
drew
toward
eleven
the

all
housed
the

spent
with
the
strain
of
the
day
also
gone
to
their

or
their
friends
homes
the
volunteers
and
a
faithful
few
were
left
they
could
not
sleep
if
war
was
going
to
be
always
as
exciting
as
this
how
did
soldiers
ever
sleep
there
was
not
among
them
a
man
who
had
ever
served
in
war
so
the
question
remained
unanswered
a
thunder
run
man
volunteered
the
information
that
the
captain
was
asleep
he
had
been
to
the
house
where
the
captain
lodged
and
his
mother
had
come
to
the
door
with
her
finger
on
her
lips
and
he
had
looked
past
her
and
seen
captain
cleave
lying
on
a
sofa
fast
asleep
thunder
run
comrades
listened
but
they
rather
doubted
the
correctness
of
his
report
it
surely
was
very
to
sleep
even
upon
a
sofa
the
night
before
marching
away
the
lieutenants
were
asleep
hairston
breckinridge
had
a
map
spread
out
upon
a
bench
before
the
post
office
and
was
demonstrating
to
an
eager
dozen
the
indubitable
fact
that
the
big
victory
would
be
either
at
harper
ferry
or
alexandria
young
matthew
coffin
was
in
love
and
might
be
seen
through
the
hotel
window
writing
candles
all
around
him
at
a
table
covering
one
pale
blue
sheet
after
another
with
impassioned
farewells
sergeants
and
corporals
and
men
were
wakeful
some
of
these
too
were
writing
letters
sending
messages
others
joined
in
the
discussion
as
to
the
theatre
of
war
or
made
knots
of
their
own
centres
of
conjectures
and
prophecy
others
roamed
the
streets
or
down
by
the
river
bank
watched
the
dark
stream
of
these
a
few
proposed
to
strip
and
have
a
swim
who
knew
when
they
see
the
old
river
again
but
the
notion
was
frowned

be
dressed

moment

might

were
not
asleep
young
matthew
coffin
sealing
his
letter
some
time
after
midnight
and
coming
out
into
the
moonlight
and
the
fragrance
of
the
locust
trees
had
an
inspiration
all
was
in
readiness
for
the
order
when
it
should
come
and
who
in
the
meantime
wanted
to
do
so
prosaic
a
thing
as
rest
boys
let
us
serenade
the
ladies
the
silver
night
wore
on
so
many
of
the
boys
had
sisters
that
there
were
many
pretty
ladies
staying
in
the
town
or
at
the
two
or
three
pleasant
old
houses
upon
its
outskirts
two
three
passed
and
there
were
yet
windows
to
sing
beneath
old
love
songs
floated
through
the
soft
and
dreamy
air
there
was
a
sense
of
angelic
beings
in
the
unlit
rooms
above
even
of
the
flutter
of
their
wings
then
at
the
music
dying
fall
flowers
were
thrown
there
seemed
to
descend
a
breath
a
whisper
adieu
heroes
adored
adored
heroes
a
scramble
for
the
flowers
then
out
at
the
gate
and
on
to
the
next
house
and
so
dawn
though
the
stars
were
yet
shining
began
to
make
itself
felt
a
coldness
was
in
the
air
a
mist
arose
from
the
river
there
came
a
sensation
of
arrest
of
somewhere
an
icy
finger
upon
the
pulse

the
virginia
infantry
colonel
valentine
brooke
was
encamped
to
the
north
of
winchester
in
the
valley
of
virginia
in
a
meadow
through
which
ran
a
stream
and
upon
a
hillside
beneath
a
hundred
chestnut
trees
covered
with
white
tassels
of
bloom
to
its
right
lay

the

and

forming
with
the
the
first

general
jackson
the
battery
attached
the
rockbridge
artillery
occupied
an
adjacent
apple
orchard
to
the
left
in
other

meadows
and
over
other
hills
were
spread
the
brigades
of
bee
bartow
and
elzey
somewhere
in
the
distance
behind
the
screen
of
haze
were
stuart
and
his
cavalry
across
the
stream
a
brick
farmhouse
ringed
with
mulberry
trees
made
the
headquarters
of
joseph
johnston
commanding
the
forces
of
the
confederacy
an
experienced
able
and
wary
soldier
engaged
just
now
with
eleven
thousand
men
in
watching
patterson
with
fifteen
thousand
on
the
one
hand
and
mcdowell
with
thousand
on
the
other
and
in
listening
attentively
for
a
voice
from
beauregard
with
twenty
thousand
at
manassas
it
was
the
middle
of
july
first
brigade
headquarters
was
a
tree
an
especially
big
tree
a
little
removed
from
the
others
beneath
it
stood
a
kitchen
chair
and
a
wooden
table
requisitioned
from
the
nearest
cabin
and
scrupulously
paid
for
at
one
side
was
an
extremely
small
tent
but
jackson
rarely
occupied
it
he
sat
beneath
the
tree
upon
the
kitchen
chair
his
feet
in
enormous
cavalry
boots
planted
precisely
before
him
his
hands
rigid
at
his
sides
here
he
transacted
the
business
of
each
day
and
here
when
it
was
over
he
sat
facing
the
north
an
awkward
inarticulate
and
peculiar
man
with
strange
notions
about
his
health
and
other
matters
there
was
about
him
no
breath
of
grace
romance
or
pomp
of
war
he
was
ungenial
ungainly
with
large
hands
and
feet
with
poor
eyesight
and
a
stiff
address
there
did
not
lack
spruce
and
handsome
youths
in
his
command
who
were
vexed
to
the
soul
by
the
idea
of
being
led
to
battle
by
such
a
figure
the
facts
that
he
had
fought
very
bravely
in
mexico
and
that
he
had
for
the
enemy
a
cold
and
formidable
hatred
were
for
him
most
other
things
against
him
he
drilled
his
troops
seven
hours
a
day
his
discipline
was
of
the
sternest
his
censure
a
thing
to
make
the
boldest
officer
blench
a
blunder
a
slight
negligence
any
disobedience
of
orders
down
came
reprimand
suspension
arrest
with
an
iron
certitude
a
relentlessness
quite
like
nature
apparently
he
was
without
imagination
he
had
but
little
sense
of
humour
and
no
understanding
of
a
joke
he
drank
water
and
sucked
lemons
for
dyspepsia
and
fancied
that
the
use
of
pepper
had
caused
a
weakness
in
his
left
leg
he
rode
a
nag
named
little
sorrel
he
carried
his
sabre
in
the
oddest
fashion
and
said
oblike
instead
of
oblique
he
found
his
greatest
pleasure
in
going
to
the
presbyterian
church
twice
on
sundays
and
to
prayer
meetings
through
the
week
now
and
then
there
was
a
gleam
in
his
eye
that
promised
something
but
the
battles
had
not
begun
and
his
soldiers
hardly
knew
what
it
promised
one
or
two
observers
claimed
that
he
was
ambitious
but
these
were
chiefly
laughed
at
to
the
brigade
at
large
he
seemed
prosaic
tedious
and
strict
enough
performing
all
duties
with
the
exactitude
monotony
and
expression
of
a
clock
keeping
all
plans
with
the
secrecy
of
the
sepulchre
rarely
sleeping
rising
at
dawn
and
requiring
his
staff
to
do
likewise
praying
at
all
seasons
and
demanding
an
implicity
of
obedience
which
might
have
been
in
order
with
some
great
and
glorious
captain
some
idolized
napoleon
but
which
seemed
hardly
the
due
of
the
late
professor
of
natural
philosophy
and
artillery
tactics
at
the
virginia
military
institute
true
it
was
that
at
harper
ferry
where
as
colonel
jackson
he
had
commanded
until
johnston
arrival
he
had
begun
to
bring
order
out
of
chaos
and
to
weave
from
a
rabble
of
volunteers
a
web
that
the
world
was
to
acknowledge
remarkable
true
too
that
on
the
second
of
july
in
the
small
affair
with
patterson
at
falling
waters
he
had
seemed
to
the
critics
in
the
ranks
not
altogether
unimposing
he
emerged
from
falling
waters
jackson
and
his
men
though
with
some
mental
reservations
began
to
call
him
old
jack
the
epithet
implied
approval
but
approval
hugely
qualified
they
might
have
said
in
fact
they
did
say
that
every
fool
knew
that
a
crazy
man
could
fight
the
army
of
the
shenandoah
was
a
civilian
army
a
slightly
organized
more
or
less
undisciplined
totally
inexperienced
in
war
impatient
and
youthful
body
of
men
with
the
lesson
yet
to
learn
that
the
shortest
distance
between
two
points
is
sometimes
a
curve
in
its
eyes
patterson
at
bunker
hill
was
exclusively
the
blot
upon
the
escutcheon
and
the
whole
game
of
war
consisted
in
somehow
doing
away
with
that
blot
there
was
great
chafing
at
the
inaction
it
was
hot
argumentative
july
weather
the
encampment
to
the
north
of
winchester
in
the
valley
of
virginia
hummed
with
the
comments
of
the
strategists
in
the
ranks
patterson
should
have
been
attacked
after
falling
waters
what
if
he
was
entrenched
behind
stone
walls
at
martinsburg
patterson
should
have
been
attacked
upon
the
fifteenth
at
bunker
hill
what
if
he
has
fifteen
thousand
men
what
if
he
has
thousand
what
if
mcdowell
is
preparing
to
cross
the
potomac
and
now
on
the
seventeenth
patterson
is
at
charlestown
creeping
eastward
evidently
going
to
surround
the
army
of
the
shenandoah
patterson
is
the
burning
reality
and
mcdowell
the
dream
and
yet
johnston
wo
move
to
the
westward
and
attack
lord
we
did
come
from
home
just
to
watch
these
chestnuts
get
ripe
all
the
generals
are
crazy
it
was
nine
in
the
morning
of
thursday
the
eighteenth
a
scorching
day
the
locusts
were
singing
of
the
heat
the
grass
wherever
men
horses
and
wagon
wheels
had
not
ground
it
into
dust
was
parched
to
a
golden
brown
the
mint
by
the
stream
looked
wilted
the
morning
drill
was
over
the
lounging
beneath
the
trees
it
was
almost
too
hot
to
fuss
about
patterson
almost
too
hot
to
pity
the
sentinels
almost
too
hot
to
wonder
where
stuart
cavalry
had
gone
that
morning
and
why
old
joe
quartered
behind
the
mulberries
in
the
brick
farmhouse
had
sent
a
staff
officer
to
old
jack
and
why
bee
and
bartow
and
brigades
had
been
similarly
visited
almost
too
hot
to
play
checkers
to
whittle
a
set
of
chessmen
to
finish
that
piece
of
greek
to
read
ivanhoe
and
resolve
to
fight
like

leading

regiment
by
regiment
from

and
the

out
upon
the

over

the

from

and
he
says

minutes

with

sick
in
winchester
the
first
brigade
followed
by
bee
bartow
and
elzey
marched
sullenly
down
the
turnpike
into
winchester
and
through
its
dusty
streets
the
people
were
all
out
old
men
boys
and
women
thronging
the
brick
sidewalks
the
army
had
seventeen
hundred
sick
in
the
town
pale
faces
looked
out
of
upper
windows
men
just
recovering
from
dysentery
from
measles
from
fever
stumbled
out
of
shady
front
yards
and
fell
into
line
others
more
helpless
started

wavered
back

go
marching
away
several
of
the
older
women
were
weeping
the
younger
looked
scornful
up
men
close
up
close
up
the
first
brigade
was
glad
when
it
was
through
the
town
before
it
leading
southward
through
the
valley
of
virginia
stretched
the
great
pike
a
hundred
and
twenty
miles
of
road
traversing
as
fair
rich
and
happy
a
region
as
war
ever
found
a
paradise
and
left
a
desolation
to
the
east
towered
the
blue
ridge
to
west
the
great
north
and
shenandoah
mountains
twenty
miles
to
the
south
massanutton
rose
like
a
gibraltar
from
the
rolling
fields
of
wheat
and
corn
the
orchard
lands
and
pleasant
pastures
the
region
was
one
of
old
mills
turning
flashing
wheels
of
comfortable
red
brick
houses
and
barns
of
fair
market
towns
of
a
noble
breed
of
horses
and
of
great
wagons
of
clear
waters
and
sweet
gardens
of
an
honest
thrifty
brave
and
intelligent
people
it
was
a
fair
country
and
many
of
the
army
were
at
home
there
but
the
army
had
at
the
moment
no
taste
for
its
beauties
it
wanted
to
see
patterson
long
blue
lines
it
wanted
to
drive
them
out
of
virginia
across
the
potomac
back
to
where
they
came
from
the
first
brigade
was
dispirited
and
critical
and
as
it
had
not
yet
learned
to
control
its
mood
it
marched
as
a
dispirited
and
critical
person
would
be
apt
to
march
in
the
brazen
middle
of
a
july
day
every
spring
and
rivulet
every
blackberry
bush
and
apple
tree
upon
the
road
gathered
recruits
the
halts
for
no
purpose
were
interminable
the
perpetual
up
close
up
men
of
the
exasperated
officers
as
unavailing
as
the
droning
in
the
heat
of
the
burnished
the
brigade
had
no
intention
of
not
making
known
its
reluctance
to
leave
patterson
it
took
an
hour
to
make
a
mile
from
winchester
general
jackson
rode
down
the
column
on
little
sorrel
and
said
something
to
the
colonel
of
each
regiment
which
something
the
colonels
passed
on
to
the
captains
the
next
mile
was
made
in
half
an
hour
the
july
dust
rose
from
the
pike
in
clouds
hot
choking
thick
as
the
rain
of
ash
from
a
volcano
it
lay
heavy
upon
coat
cap
haversack
and
knapsack
upon
the
muskets
and
upon
the
colours
drooping
in
the
heat
drooping
at
the
idea
of
turning
back
upon
patterson
and
going
off
heaven
and
old
joe
knew
where
tramp
tramp
over
the
hot
pike
sullenly
southward
hot
without
and
hot
within
the
knapsack
was
heavy
the
haversack
was
heavy
the
musket
was
heavy
sweat
ran
down
from
under
cap
or
felt
hat
and
made
grimy
trenches
down
cheek
and
chin
the
men
had
too
thick
underwear
they
carried
overcoat
and
blanket
it
was
hot
hot
and
every
pound
like
ten
keep
to
throw
away
to
keep
to
throw
away
the
beat
of
feet
kept
time
to
that
pressing
question
and
to
marching
to
be
marching
reckon
old
joe
thinks
it
and
to
in
hell
are
we
going
anyway
through
the
enormous
dust
cloud
that
the
army
raised
the
trees
of
the
valley
appeared
as
brown
smudges
against
an
ochreish
sky
the
farther
hills
and
the
mountains
were
not
seen
at
all
the
stone
fences
on
either
side
the
road
the
blackberry
bushes
the
elder
the
occasional
apple
or
cherry
tree
were
all
but
dun
lines
and
blotches
oh
hot
hot
a
man
swung
his
arm
and
a
rolled
overcoat
landed
in
the
middle
of
a
briar
patch
a
second
followed
suit
a
third
a
fourth
a
great
fellow
from
some
mountain
clearing
jerked
at
the
lacing
of
his
shoes
and
in
a
moment
was
marching
barefoot
the
offending
leather
swinging
from
his
arm
to
right
and
left
he
found
imitators
a
corpulent
man
a
merchant
used
to
a
big
chair
set
in
the
shady
front
of
a
village
store
suffered
greatly
pale
about
the
lips
and
with
his
breath
coming
in
wheezing
gasps
his
overcoat
went
first
then
his
roll
of
blanket
finally
he
gazed
a
moment
sorrowfully
enough
at
his
knapsack
then
dropped
it
too
quietly
in
a
fence
corner
up
men
close
up
a
wind
arose
and
blew
the
dust
maddeningly
to
and
fro
in
the
colour
company
of
the
a
boy
began
to
cough
uncontrollably
with
a
hollow
sound
those
near

the
doctor
the
first
thing
after
cheer
up
men
no
one
going
to
send
you
home
without
fighting
from
the
rear
came
a
rumble
shouted
orders
a
cracking
of
whips
the
column
swerved
to
one
side
of
the
broad
road
and
the
rockbridge
artillery
passed
a
vision
of
horses
guns
and
men
wrapped
in
a
dun
whirlwind
and
disappearing
in
the
blast
they
were
gone
in
thunder
through
the
heat
and
haze
the
virginia
wondered
to
a
man
why
it
had
not
chosen
the
artillery
out
of
a
narrow
way
stretching
westward
came
suddenly
at
a
gallop
a
handful
of
troopers
black
plumed
and
magnificently
mounted
swinging
into
the
pike
and
disappearing
in
a
pillar
of
dust
toward
the
head
of
the
column
back
out
of
the
cloud
sounded
the
jingling
of
accoutrements
the
neighing
of
horses
a
shouted
order
the
infantry
groaned
ten
of
the
black
horse
where
are
the
rest
of
them
i
wonder
oh
ai
they
lucky
dogs
stuart
men
have
the
sweetest
time
just
galloping
over
the
country
and
making
love
and
listening

have
a
good
time

the

the
road

was
shady
like
that
a
bugle
blew
the
command
to

ran
down
the
column
the
first
brigade
came
to
a
stand
upon
the
dusty
pike
in
the
heat
and
glare
the
was
the
third
in
column
the
and
the
leading
suddenly
from
the
there
burst
a
cheer
a
loud
and
high
note
of
relief
and
exultation
a
moment
and
the
infection
had
spread
to
the
it
too
was
cheering
wildly
apparently
there
were
several
couriers
no
staff
officers
the
saw
the
gold
lace
with
some
message
or
order
from
the
commanding
general
now
well
in
advance
with
his
guard
of
black
horse
they
were
riding
down
the
line
old
jack
was
with
them
the
and
the
were
cheering
like
mad
the
colonel
of
the
rode
forward
there
was
a
minute
parley
then
he
turned

broke
off
and
waved
forward

what
a
terror
to
we
going
after
the
aide
a
young
man
superbly
mounted
laughed
raised
his
voice
the
army
of
the
valley
is
going
through
ashby
gap
to
piedmont
and
from
piedmont
by
rail
to
manassas
junction
general

still
at
winchester
amusing
general
patterson
at
manassas
our
gallant
army
under
general
beauregard
is
attacked
by
mcdowell
with
overwhelming
numbers
the
commanding
general
hopes
that
his
troops
will
step
out
like
men
and
make
a
forced
march
to
save
the
country
he
was
gone
the
other
staff
officers
were
gone
old
jack
was
gone
they
passed
the
shouting
and
presently
from
down
the
line
came
the
cheers
of
the
and
virginia
old
jack
rode
back
alone
the
length
of
his
brigade
and
so
overflowing
was
the
enthusiasm
of
the
men
that
they
cheered
him
cheered
lustily
he
touched
his
old
forage
cap
went
stiffly
by
upon
little
sorrel
from
the
rear
far
down
the
road
could
be
heard
the
voices
of
bee
bartow
and
elzey
ardour
elasticity
strength
returned
to
the
army
of
the
shenandoah
with
a
triumphant
cry
the
first
brigade
wheeled
into
the
road
that
led
eastward
through
the
blue
ridge
by
ashby
gap
two
three
four
came
and
passed
enthusiasm
carried
the
men
fast
and
far
but
they
were
raw
troops
and
they
suffered
the
sun
too
was
enthusiastic
burning
with
all
its
might
the
road
proved
neither
cool
nor
shady
all
the
springs
seemed
suddenly
to
have
dried
up
out
of
every
hour
there
was
a
halt
of
ten
minutes
and
it
was
needed
the
men
dropped
by
the
roadside
upon
the
parched
grass
beneath
the
shadow
of
the
sumach
and
the
elder
bushes
and
lay
without
speaking
the
small
farmers
the
mountaineers
the
hunters
the
ploughmen
fared
not
so
badly
but
the
planters
of
many
acres
the
lawyers
the
doctors
the
divines
the
merchants
the
millers
and
the
innkeepers
the
undergraduates
from
the
university
the
youths
from
classical
academies
county
stores
village
banks
lawyers
offices
all
who
led
a
horseback
or
sedentary
existence
and
the
elderly
men
and
the
very
young
these
suffered
heavily
the
mounted
officers
were
not
but
they
also
had
heat
thirst
and
hunger
and
in
addition
responsibility
inexperience
and
the
glance
of
their
brigadier
the
ten
minutes
were
soon
over
in
fall
in
men
the
short
rest
made
the
going
worse
the
soldiers
rose
so
stiff
and
sore
the
men
had
eaten
before
leaving
the
camp
above
winchester
but
that
was
days
ago
now
as
they
went
through
clarke
county
there
appeared
at
at
plantation
gates
at
stiles
leading
into
green
fields
ladies
young
and
old
bearing
baskets
of
good
things
hastily
snatched
from
pantry
and
table
they
had
pitchers
too
of
iced
tea
of
cold
milk
even
of
raspberry
acid
and
sangaree
how
good
it
all
was
and
how
impossible
to
go
around
but
fed
or
hungry
refreshed
or
thirsty
the
men
blessed
the
donors
and
that
reverently
with
a
purity
of
thought
a
chivalrousness
of
regard
a
shade
of
feeling
youthful
and
sweet
and
yet
virile
enough
which
went
with
the
confederate
soldier
into
the
service
and
abode
to
the
end
the
long
afternoon
wore
to
a
close
the
heat
decreased
but
the
dust
remained
and
the
weariness
grew
to
gigantic
proportions
the
first
brigade
was
well
ahead
of
bee
bartow
and
elzey
it
had
started
in
advance
and
it
had
increased
the
distance
if
there
was
any
marching
in
men
jackson
forced
it
out
they
went
a
league
for
him
where
another
would
have
procured
but
a
mile
but
even
he
even
enthusiasm
and
the
necessity
of
relieving
beauregard
got
upon
this
march
less
than
two
miles
an
hour
most
happily
mcdowell
advancing
on
beauregard
and
bull
run
and
fearing
masked
batteries
marched
much
more
slowly
at
sunset
the
first
brigade
reached
the
shenandoah
the
mounted
officers
took
up
one
and
sometimes
two
men
beside
them
and
the
horses
struggled
bravely
through
the
cold
rapid
current
behind
them
company
by
company
the
men
stripped
off
coat
and
trousers
piled
clothing
and
ammunition
upon
their
heads
held
high
their
muskets
and
so
crossed
the
guns
and
wagons
followed
before
the
river
was
passed
the
night
fell
dark
the
heat
was
now
gone
by
the
dust
was
washed
away
the
men
had
drunk
their
fill
from
the
haversacks
they
took
the
remnant
of
the
food
cooked
that
morning
the
biscuit
and
the
bacon
tasted
very
good
not
enough
of
either
it
was
true
but
still
something
the
road
above
the
river
rose
steeply
for
here
was
the
blue
ridge
lofty
and
dark
rude
with
rock
and
shaggy
with
untouched
forests
this
was
the
pass
through
the
mountains
this
was
ashby
gap
the
brigade
climbed
with
the
road
tired
and
silent
and
grim
the
day
had
somehow
been
a
foretaste
of
war
the
men
had
a
new
idea
of
the
draught
and
of
the
depth
of
the
cup
they
felt
older
and
the
air
blowing
down
from
the
mountains
seemed
the
air
of
a
far
country
toward
which
they
had
been
travelling
almost
without
knowing
it
they
saw
now
that
it
was
a
strange
country
much
unlike
that
in
which
they
had
hitherto
lived
they
climbed
slowly
between
dark
crag
and
tree
and
wearily
all
song
and
jest
had
died
they
were
tired
soldiers
hungry
now
for
sleep
up
men
close
up
they
came
to
the
height
of
the
pass
marked
by
a
giant
poplar
whose
roots
struck
deep
into
four
counties
here
again
there
was
a
ten
minutes
halt
the
men
sank
down
upon
the
soft
beds
of
leaf
and
mould
their
eyelids
drooped
they
were
in
a
dream
at
once
and
in
a
dream
heard
the
in
fall
in
men
the
column
stumbled
to
its
feet
and
began
the
descent
of
the
mountain
clouds
came
up
at
midnight
when
they
reached
the
lower
slope
it
was
raining
later
they
came
to
the
outskirts
of
the
village
of
paris
to
a
grove
of
mighty
oaks
and
here
the
brigade
was
halted
for
the
night
the
men
fell
upon
the
ground
and
slept
no
food
was
taken
and
no
sentries
were
posted
an
aide
very
asked
if
guard
should
not
be
set
no
sir
answered
the
general
let
them
sleep
and
you
sir
i
do
feel
like
it
i
see
that
there
is
no
alarm
with
his
cloak
about
him
with
his
old
cadet
cap
pulled
down
over
his
eyes
awkward
and
simple
and
plain
he
paced
out
the
night
beneath
the
trees
or
sat
upon
a
broken
rail
fence
watching
his
sleeping
soldiers
and
the
aide
thought
praying
the
light
rain
ceased
the
sky
cleared
the
pale
dawn
came
up
from
the
east
in
the
first
pink
light
the
bugles
sounded
up
rose
the
first
brigade
cooked
and
ate
its
breakfast
swung
out
from
the
oak
grove
upon
the
highroad
and
faced
the
rising
sun
the
morning
was
divinely
cool
the
men
in
high
spirits
piedmont
and
the
railway
were
but
six
miles
down
the
road
the
first
brigade
covered
the
distance
by
eight
there
was
the
station
there
was
the
old
manassas
gap
railroad
there
was
the
train
of
freight
and
cattle
cars
ever
so
many
freight
and
cattle
cars
company
after
company
the
men
piled
in
by
ten
every
car
was
filled
and
the
platforms
and
roofs
had
their
quota
the
crazy
old
engine
blew
its
whistle
the
first
brigade
was
off
for
manassas
bee
bartow
and
elzey
arriving
at
piedmont
in
the
course
of
the
morning
were
not
so
fortunate
the
railroad
had
promised
barring
accident
to
place
the
four
brigades
in
manassas
by
sunrise
of
the
twentieth
the
accident
duly
arrived
there
was
a
collision
the
track
was
obstructed
and
only
the
and
georgia
got
through
the
remainder
of
the
infantry
waited
perforce
at
piedmont
a
portion
of
it
for
two
mortal
days
and
that
without
rations
the
artillery
and
the
cavalry
the
latter
having
now
come
up
marched
by
the
wagon
road
and
arrived
in
fair
time
from
ten
in
the
morning
until
sunset
the
first
brigade
and
the
manassas
gap
train
crept
like
a
tortoise
through
the
july
weather
by
rustling
cornfields
by
stream
and
wood
by
farmhouse
and
village
it
was
hot
in
the
freight
and
cattle
cars
hot
cinderish
and
noisy
with
here
and
there
an
exception
the
men
took
off
their
coats
loosened
the
shoes
from
their
feet
made
themselves
easy
in
any
way
that
suggested
itself
the
subtle
the
slip
out
of
convention
and
restraint
back
toward
a
less
trammelled
existence
the
faint
return
of
the
more
purely
physical
the
slight
withdrawal
of
the
more
purely
mental
the
rapid
breaking
down
of
the
sheer
artificial
these
and
other
marks
of
one
of
the
many
predicates
of
war
began
to
show
themselves
in
this
journey
but
at
the
village
stations
there
came
a
change
women
and
girls
were
gathered
here
in
muslin
freshness
with
food
and
drink
for
our
heroes
the
apparel
discarded
between
stations
was
assiduously
reassumed
whenever
the
whistle
blew
our
heroes
looked
out
of
freight
and
cattle
car
somewhat
grimy
perhaps
but
clothed
and
in
their
right
mind
with
a
becoming
bloom
upon
them
of
eagerness
deference
and
patriotic
willingness
to
die
in
virginia
defence
the
dispensers
of
nectar
and
ambrosia
loved
them
all
sped
them
on
to
manassas
with
many
a
prayer
and
god
bless
you
at
sunset
the
whistle
shrieked
its
loudest
it
was
their
destination
the
train
jolted
and
jerked
to
a
halt
regiment
by
regiment
out
poured
the
first
brigade
fell
into
line
and
was
four
miles
to
mitchell
ford
and
a
pine
wood
where
hungry
thirsty
dirty
and
exhausted
the
ranks
were
broken
this
was
the
night
of
the
nineteenth
at
piedmont
the
brigade
had
heard
of
yesterday
minor
affair
at
this
ford
between
tyler
division
and
longstreet
the
honours
of
the
engagement
resting
with
the
confederate
in
the
pine
wood
there
was
a
line
of
fresh
graves
on
the
brown
needles
lay
boughs
that
shell
had
cut
from
the
trees
there
were
certain
stains
upon
the
ground
the
first
brigade
ate
and
slept
the
last
somewhat
feverishly
the
night
passed
without
alarm
an
attack
in
force
was
expected
in
the
morning
but
it
did
not
come
mcdowell
amazingly
enough
still
rested
confident
that
patterson
had
detained
johnston
in
the
valley
possessed
by
this
belief
he
was
now
engaged
in
a
reconnoissance
by
stealth
his
object
being
to
discover
a
road
whereby
to
cross
bull
run
above
the
stone
bridge
and
turn
beauregard
left
this
proceeding
and
an
afternoon
rest
in
camp
occupied
him
the
whole
of
the
twentieth
on
this
day
johnston
himself
reached
manassas
bringing
with
him
bee
mississippi
and
alabama
and
bartow
and
georgia
stuart
having
successfully
amused
patterson
was
also
on
hand
the
remainder
of
the
army
of
the
shenandoah
detained
by
the
break
upon
the
manassas
gap
was
yet
missing
and
many
an
anxious
glance
the
generals
cast
that
way
the
first
brigade
undiscovered
by
the
reconnoissance
by
stealth
rested
all
day
saturday
beneath
the
pines
at
mitchell
ford
and
at
night
slept
quietly
no
longer
minding
the
row
of
graves
at
dawn
of
sunday
a
cannon
woke
the
men
loud
and
startling
mcdowell
signal
gun
fired
from
centreville
and
announcing
to
the
federal
host
that
the
interrupted
march
the
on
to
richmond
blazoned
on
banners
and
chalked
on
trunks
would
now
be
resumed
willy
nilly
the
rebel
horde
on
the
southern
bank
of
bull
run
chapter
vii
the
dogs
of
war
in
the
east
was
a
great
flare
of
pink
with
small
golden
clouds
floating
across
all
seen
uncertainly
between
branches
of
pine
a
mist
lay
above
bull
run
on
the
high
opposite
bank
the
woods
rose
huddled
indistinct
and
the
air
was
still
cool
and
pure
a
sunday
morning
waiting
for
church
bells
there
were
no
bells
the
silence
was
shattered
by
all
the
drums
of
the
brigade
beating
the
long
roll
men
rose
from
the
pine
needles
shook
themselves
caught
up
musket
and
ammunition
belt
the
echoes
from
mcdowell
signal
cannon
had
hardly
died
when
upon
the
wooded
banks
of
bull
run
the
first
brigade
stood
in
arms
minutes
passed
mitchell
ford
marked
the
confederate
centre
here
and
at
blackburn
ford
were
bonham
bee
bartow
longstreet
and
jackson
down
the
stream
at
maclean
ford
and
union
mills
early
and
ewell
and
jones
held
the
right
to
the
left
up
bull
run
beyond
bee
and
beyond
stuart
at
the
island
ball
and
lewis
fords
were
cocke
brigade
and
hampton
legion
and
farther
yet
at
the
stone
bridge
evans
with
a
small
brigade
upon
the
northern
bank
of
the
run
in
the
thick
woods
opposite
mitchell
and
blackburn
fords
was
believed
to
be
the
mass
of
the
invaders
there
had
been
a
certitude
that
the
battle
would
join
about
these
fords
beauregard
plan
was
to
cross
at
maclean
and
fall
upon
the
federal
left
johnston
had
acceded
and
with
the
first
light
orders
had
gone
to
the
brigadiers
hold
yourselves
in
readiness
to
cross
and
to
attack
now
suddenly
from
the
extreme
left
away
in
the
direction
of
the
stone
bridge
burst
an
unexpected
sound
both
of
musketry
and
artillery
it
was
distant
it
waxed
and
waned
and
waxed
again
the
first
brigade
nervous
impatient
chilled
by
the
dawn
peered
across
its
own
reach
of
misty
stream
and
saw
naught
but
the
woods
tyler
division
was
over
there
it
knew
when
would
firing
begin
along
this
line
when
would
the
brigade
have
orders
to
move
when
would
it
cross
when
would
things
begin
to
happen
an
hour
passed
ranks
were
broken
and
the
men
allowed
to
cook
and
eat
a
hasty
breakfast
how
good
in
the
wood
tasted
the
scalding
coffee
how
good
the
cornbread
and
the
bacon
the
last
crumb
swallowed
they
waited
again
lying
on
the
brown
earth
beneath
the
pines
the
mounted
officers
advanced
upon
the
bank
of
the
stream
and
seen
through
the
mist
loomed
larger
man
and
horse
than
life
jackson
sat
very
quiet
upon
little
sorrel
his
lips
moving
far
up
the
stream
the
firing
continued
the
and
virginia
fidgeted
groaned
swore
with
impatience
suddenly
the
nearer
echoes
awoke
a
federal
battery
posted
on
the
hills
beyond
the
fringe
of
thick
wood
on
the
northern
bank
opened
a
slow
and
ineffective
fire
against
the
hills
and
woods
across
the
stream
the
confederates
kept
their
position
masked
made
no
reply
the
shells
fell
short
and
did
harm
only
to
the
forest
and
its
creatures
nearly
all
fell
short
but
one
a
shell
from
a
parrott
entered
the
pine
wood
by
mitchell
ford
fell
among
the
wagons
of
the
and
exploded
a
driver
was
killed
a
mule
mangled
so
that
it
must
be
shot
and
an
ambulance
split
into
kindling
wood
few
in
the
first
brigade
had
seen
such
a
thing
before
the
men
brushed
the
pine
needles
and
the
earth
from
their
coats
and
looked
at
the
furrowed
ground
and
at
the
headless
body
of
the
driver
with
a
startled
curiosity
there
was
a
sense
of
a
sudden
and
vivid
flash
from
behind
the
veil
and
they
as
suddenly
perceived
that
the
veil
was
both
cold
and
dark
this
then
was
one
of
the
ways
in
which
death
came
shrieking
like
this
ugly
and
resistless
the
july
morning
was
warm
and
bright
but
more
than
one
of
the
volunteers
in
that
wood
shivered
as
though
it
were
winter
jackson
rode
along
the
front
they
do
attack
in
force
at
the
stone
bridge
a
feint
i
think
he
stopped
before
the
colour
company
of
the
captain
cleave
yes
sir
you
have
hunters
from
the
mountains
after
the
battle
send
me
the
man
you
think
would
make
the
best
scout
an
intelligent
man
very
well
sir
the
other
turned
little
sorrel
head
toward
the
stream
and
stood
listening
the
sound
of
the
distant
cannonade
increased
the
pine
wood
ran
back
from
the
water
grew
thinner
and
gave
place
to
mere
copse
and
a
field
of
broomsedge
from
this
edge
of
the
forest
came
now
a
noise
of
mounted
men
black
horse
i
reckon
said
the
wish
they
go
ask
old
joe
what
he
and
beauregard
have
got
against
us
no
black
horse
i
see
them
through
the
trees
gray
slouch
hats
and
no
feathers
in
them
infantry
too
more
infantry
than
horse
hampton
maybe
no
they
look
like
home
folk
a
horseman
appeared
in
the
wood
guiding
a
powerful
black
stallion
with
a
light
hand
between
the
pines
and
checking
him
with
a
touch
beside
the
bank
upon
which
little
sorrel
was
planted
general
jackson
inquired
a
dry
agreeable
voice
yes
sir
i
am
general
jackson
what
troops
have
you
over
there
the
virginia
legion
jackson
put
out
a
large
hand

am
glad
to
see
you

mexico
but
i
heard
of
you

heard
of
you
the
other
gave
his
smile
quick
and
magnetic
and
i
of
you
general
magruder
chanted
your
praises
day
and
night
our
good
old
fuss
and
feathers
too
oh
mexico
jackson
countenance
so
rigid
plain
restrained
altered
as
through
some
effect
of
soft
and
sunny
light
the
blue
of
the
eye
deepened
the
iris
enlarged
a
smile
came
to
his
lips
his
stiffly
held
awkwardly
erect
figure
relaxed
though
very
slightly
i
loved
it
in
mexico
i
have
never
forgotten
it
land
of
the
daughters
of
spain
the
light
went
indoors
again
that
demonstration
upstream
is
increasing
colonel
evans
will
need
support
yes
we
must
have
orders
shortly
turning
in
his
saddle
cary
gazed
across
the
stream
andrew
porter
and
burnside
are
somewhere
over
there
i
wonder
if
burnside
remembers
the
last
time
he
was
in
virginia
he
laughed
dabney
maury
wedding
in
at
cleveland
and
burnside
happy
as
a
king
singing
virginia
never
tire
stealing
kisses
from
the
bridesmaids
hunting
with
the
hardest
dancing
till
cockcrow
and
asking
twenty
times
a
day
do
we
do
like
this
in
indiana
i
wonder
i
wonder
he
laughed
again
good
old
burnside

an
odd
world
we
live
in
general
the
world
sir

as
god
made
it
and
as
satan
darkened
it
cary
regarded
him
somewhat
whimsically
well
we
agree
on
god
now
and
perhaps
before
this
struggle
over
we
agree
on
satan
that
firing
growing
louder
i
think
there

cousin
of
mine
in
the
yonder
by
the
colours

i
speak
to
him

i
have
noticed

him
with
readiness
he
beckoned
and
when

little
sorrel
to
the
edge
of
the
stream

with
a
folded
bit
of
paper
jackson
took
and
opened
the
missive
with
his
usual
deliberation
glanced
over
the
contents
and
pushed
little
sorrel
nearer
to

he
read
aloud

in
a
low
voice

gathered
up
his
reins
thank
you
general
and
laurels
to
us
all
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
to
cleave
he
was
gone
crashing
through
the
thinning
pines
to
the
broomsedge
field
and
his
waiting
men
it
was
nine
hot
and
clear
the
stone
bridge
three
miles
away
the
first
brigade
went
at
a
double
quick
guided
by
the
sound
of
musketry
growing
in
volume
the
pines
were
left
behind
oak
copse
succeeded
then
the
up
and
down
of
grassy
fields
wooden
fences
stretched
across
the
way
streamlets
presented
themselves
here
and
there
gaped
a
ravine
ragged
and
deep
on
and
on
and
over
all
bee
and
bartow
were
ahead
and
hampton
and
the
virginia
legion
the
sound
of
the
guns
grew
louder

got
but
six
regiments
on

get
on
the
fields
were
very
rough
all
things
uneven
and
retarding
only
the
sun
had
no
obstacles
he
rose
high
and
there
set
in
a
scorching
day
the
men
climbed
a
bank
of
red
earth
and
struck
across
a
great
cornfield
they
stumbled
over
the
furrows
they
broke
down
the
stalks
they
tore
aside
the
intertwining
small
blue
wet
with
the
dew
of
the
field
they
left
it
and
dipped
again
into
woods
the
shade
did
not
hold
now
they
were
traversing
an
immense
and
wasted
stretch
where
the
dewberry
caught
at
their
ankles
and
the
sun
had
an
unchecked
sway
ahead
the
firing
grew
louder
on
men
get
on
allan
gold
hurrying
with
his
hurrying
world
found
in
life
this
july
morning
something
he
had
not
found
before
apparently
there
were
cracks
in
the
firmament
through
which
streamed
a
dazzling
light
an
invigorating
air
after
all
there
was
something
wide
it
seemed
in
war
something
sweet
it
was
bright
and
hot
they
were
going
clean
and
childlike
to
help
their
fellows
at
the
bridge
when
near
at
hand
a
bugle
blew
high
as
a
lark
above
the
stress
he
followed
the
sound
with
a
clear
delight
he
felt
no
fatigue
and
he
had
never
seen
the
sky
so
blue
the
woods
so
green
chance
brought
him
for
a
moment
in
line
with
his
captain
well
allan
i
seem
to
have
waked
up
said
allan
then
very
soberly
i
am
going
to
like
this
thing
cleave
laughed
you
have
the
air
of
a
norse
sea
king
for
nothing
they
dipped
into
a
bare
red
gully
scrambled
up
the
opposite
bank
and
fought
again
with
the
dewberry
vines
when
the
battle
over
you
to
report
to
general
jackson
say
that
i
sent
you
that
you
the
man
he
asked
for
this
morning
the
entangling
vines
abruptly
gave
up
the
fight
a
soft
hillside
of
pasturage
succeeded
down
which
the
men
ran
like
schoolboys
a
gray
zigzag
of
rail
fence
a
little
plashy
stream
another
hillside
and
at
the
top
planted
against
a
horizon
of
haze
and
sound
a
courier
hatless
upon
a
reeking
horse
general
jackson

at
a
run
they
plunged
again
into
the
trough
of
those
low
waves
the
first
brigade
had
proved
its
mettle
but
here
it
began
to
lose
men

out
of

and
were
left
behind
in
virginia

july
sunshine

no
bagatelle

beat
hard

many
in
these
ranks

awful
strangeness
at
home

ice
and
cooling
fans
a
pleasant
and
shady
ride
to
a
pleasant
shady
church
a
little
dozing
through
a
comfortable
sermon
then
friends
and
crops
and
politics
in
the
twilight
dells
of
an
old
churchyard

home
and

in
the
first

the
friendly
fence
and
found
itself
upon
a
stretch
of
road
in
a
dust
cloud
that
neatly
capped
all
previous
ills
at
some
distance
rose
the
low
hill
covered
upon
this
side
by
a
second
growth
of
pines
that
the
henry

steep
to
the

marshy

you
see
the
cleared
ground
when
you
get
on
top
a
bowshot
from
the
wood
the
head
of
the
column
was
met
by
a
second
courier
a
boy
from
the
alabama
river
riding
like
jehu
pale
with
excitement
when
you
get
to
the
top
of
the
hill
you
see
thicker
than
bees
from
a
sweet
gum
they
thicker
than
bolls
in

they
got
three
thousand

trees
were
small
bundles
of
hard
bright
green
needles
aloft
on
slender
trunks
out
of
which
in
the
strong
sunshine
resin
was
oozing
they
were
set
well
apart
the
grass
beneath
dry
and
slippery
strewn
with
cones
the
sky
was
intensely
blue
the
air
hot
and
without
moisture
the
scent
of
the
pines
strong
in
the
nostril
another

and
the
came
upon
the

of

invisible

of

seen
accidents
men
injured
in
various
ways
but
never
had
it
viewed
so
many
nor
so
much
blood
and
never
before
had
it
rushed
past
the
helpless
and
the
agonizing
there
were
surgeons
and
ambulances
there
seemed
to
be
a

of
planks
on

onward
between

presently
in

narrow
road

without
panic

about

still
the
pine
thicket
blazed
upon
by
the
sun
shrilled
in
by
winged
legions
before
them
was
the
field
of

a
tableland
cut
by
gullies
furred
with
knots
of

in

a

and
a
small
house
the

in
which
too
old
and
ill
to

the

were
the

rose
the

hill
ranged
upon
this
height
ricketts

and
many
another

were
sending
shrieking
shells
against
the
henry
hill
north
and
east
and
west
of
the
batteries
ran
long
radii
of
blue
pointed
with
bright
banners
and
out
of
the
hollow
between
the
hills
came
a
smoke
and
noise
as
of
the
nethermost
pit
there
beneath
that
sulphurous
cloud
the
north
and
the
south
were
locked
in
an
embrace
that
was
not
of
love
chapter

a
christening
imboden
had
been
joined
by
the
rockbridge
artillery
and
the
alexandria
and
loudoun
batteries
a
little
later
there
came
up
two
of
the
new
orleans
guns
all
unlimbered
in
front
of
the
pine
wood
where
was
couched
the
first
brigade
trained
the
sixteen
guns
upon
the
mathews
hill
and
began
firing
griffin
and
ricketts
and
arnold
answered
with
parrotts
and
howitzers
throwing
elongated
cylindrical
shell
that
came
with
the
screech
of
a
banshee
but
the
federal
range
was
too
long
and
the
fuses
of
many
shells
were
uncut
two
of
rockbridge
horses
were
killed
a
caisson
of
stanard
exploded
scorching
the
gunners
a
lieutenant
was
wounded
in
the
thigh
but
the
batteries
suffered
less
than
did
the
infantry
in
the

here
more
than
one
exploding
horror
wrought
destruction
immediately
in

the

down
in

just
sheltered
by
the
final
fringe
of
pines
the
younger
officers
stood
up
or
stepping
into
the
clearing
seated
themselves
not
without
ostentation
upon
pine
stumps
to
the
laudable
end
that
the

should
know
where
to
find
them
jackson
rode
back
and
forth
behind
the

the
thundering
voices
grew
louder
shaking
the

the

brigade
could
not
see
the
infantry
swept
now
from
the
mathews
hill
and
engaged
about
the

and
the
stream
by
stretching
necks
it

roof
of

hiding
pandemonium
beneath
that
deeper
thunder
of

the
crackling
unintermittent
sound
of

the

between

no

the

the

threw
up
his

out
an

and
turned
to
speak
to

whose
profanity
he
had
apparently
forgiven
as
in
any
other
july
hour
a
cloud
of
gnats
might
have
swum
above

every

drew
out
a
handkerchief
wrapped
it
around
the

and
rode
on
down
the
right
of
his
line
up
to
meet
him
from
the
foot
of
the

out
of
the

at
a

bearing
a

about

struck
spur
into
the
roan
and
galloped
across
the
plateau
out
of
one
of
the
furrowing
ravines
a
sunbaked
and
wrinkled
trough
springing
from
the
turnpike
below
and
running
up
and
across
the
henry
hill
toward
the
crest
of
pine
and
oak
came
now
a
handful
of
men
grey
shadows
reeling
seeking
the
forest
and
night
another
followed
another
then
a
stream
a
grey
runlet
of
defeat
which
grew
in
proportions
a
moment
more
and
the
ravine
fed
from
the
below
overflowed
the
red
light
shifted
to
the
henry
hill
it
was
as
though
a
closed
fan
laid
upon
that
uneven
ground
had
suddenly
opened
the
rout
was
not
hideous
the
men
had
fought
long
and
boldly
against
great
odds
they
fled
now
before
the
storm
but
all
cohesion
was
not
lost
nor
presence
of
mind
some
turned
and
fired
some
listened
to
their
shouting
officer
and
strove
to
form
about
the
tossed
colours
some
gave
and
took
advice
but
every
gun
of
the
federal
batteries
poured
shot
and
shell
upon
that
hilltop
and
the
lines
of

he
rose
in
his
stirrups
and
held
his
sword
aloft
standing
against
the
sky
upon
the
rim
of
the
ravine
he
looked
colossal

cried
aloud

standing
like

the

along
the
summit
just
in

of
a

ran
a
stone
wall
grey
irregular
touched
here
by
sunlight
there
by
shadow
and
shrouded
in
part
by
the
battle
smoke
some
one
had
planted
upon
it
a

for
a
full

leap
victorious
up
the

the

torn

the

and

fell
around
the
guns
of

the
guns
were
not
silenced

loudoun
and
their
fellows
answered
with
their
virginia
military
institute
with
their
howitzers
with
their
one
or
two
napoleons
but
ricketts
and
griffin
held
fast
the
great
shells
came
hurtling
death
screaming
its
message
and
sweeping
the
pine
wood
the
stone
wall
suffered
here
and
there
the
units
dropped
from
place
jackson
holding
up
his
wounded
hand
came
to
the

get
these
guns
out
of
my
way
i
am
going
to
give
them
the
bayonet
the
bugler
put
the
bugle
to
his

the
guns
limbered
up
moving
out
by
the
right
flank
and
taking
position
elsewhere
upon
the
plateau
jackson
returned
to
his
troops
fix
bayonets
now
men
charge
and
take
those
batteries
the
first
brigade
rose
from
beneath
the
pines
it
rose
it
advanced
between
the
moving
guns
it
shouted
the
stone
wall
became
an
avalanche
and
started
down
the
slope
it
began
for
the
pine
wood
where
it
had
lain
curved
around
ricketts
and
griffin
like
a
hand
from
the
finger
nearest
the
doomed
batteries
sprang
the
virginia
in
the
dust
of
the
field
all
uniforms
were
now
of
one
neutral
hue
griffin
trained
his
guns
upon
the
approaching
body
but
his
chief
stopped
him
they
our
own
man
a
supporting
regiment
the
virginia
came
on
halted
at
two
hundred
feet
and
poured
upon
the
batteries
a
withering
fire
alas
for
ricketts
and
griffin
brave
men
handling
brave
guns
their
cannoneers
fell
and
the
scream
of
their
horses
shocked
the
field
ricketts
was
badly
wounded
his
lieutenant
ramsay
lay
dead
the
stone
wall
blazed
again
the
federal
infantry
supporting
the
guns
broke
and
fled
in
confusion
other

michigan
and

this
time
came
up
the
hill
a
officer
heintzleman
seated
sideways
in
his
saddle
upon
a
hillock
appealing
cheering
commanding
was
conspicuous
for
his
gallant
bearing
the
hotly
pushed
fell
back
into
the
curving
wood
only
to
emerge
again
and
bear
down
upon
the
prize
of
the
guns
the
whole
of
the
first
brigade
was
now
in
action
and
the
plateau
of
the
henry
hill
roared
like
the
forge
of
vulcan
when
it
welded
the
armour
of
mars
it
was
three
in
the
afternoon
of
midmost
july
there
arose
smoke
and
shouts
and
shrieks
the
thunder
from
the
mathews
hill
of
the
north
uncrippled
artillery
and
from
the
plateau
the
answering
thunder
of
the
southern
with
the
under
song
incessant
of
the
muskets
men
tongues
clave
to
the
roofs
of
their
mouths
the
sweat
streamed
forth
and
the
sweat
dried
black
cartridge
marks
were
about
their
lips
and
their
eyes
felt
metallic
heated
balls
distending
the
socket
there
was
a
smell
of
burnt
cloth
of
powder
of
all
heated
and
brazen
things
indescribable
unforgettable
the
effluvia
of
the
battlefield
the
palate
savoured
brass
and
there
was
not
a
man
of
those
thousands
who
was
not
thirsty
oh
very
very
thirsty
time
went
in
waves
with
hollows
between
of
negation
a
movement
took
hours
surely
we
have
been
at
it
since
last
year
another
passed
in
a
lightning
flash
we
were
there
beneath
the
pines
on
the
ground
zouaves
and
united
states
marines
above
us
a
noisy
shell
the
voice
of
the
general
coming
dry
and
far
like
a
grasshopper
through
the
din
we
are
here
in
a
trampled
flower
garden
beside
the
stumps
of
locust
trees
in
the
midst
of
yells
and
trampling
hands
again
upon
the
guns
there
was
no
time
between
the
men
who
were
left
of
ricketts
and
griffin
fought
well
they
were
brave
fighters
the
wisconsin
came
up
the
hill
then
the
and
new
york
an
impact
followed
that
seemed
to
rock
the
globe
wisconsin
and
new
york
retired
whence
they
came
and
it
was
all
done
in
a
moment
other
regiments
took
their
places
mcdowell
was
making
a
frontal
attack
and
sending
in
his
brigades
piecemeal
the
plateau
was
uneven
low
ridges
shallow
hollows
with
clumps
of
pine
and
oak
one
saw
at
a
time
but
a
segment
of
the
field
the
nature
of
the
ground
split
the
troops
as
with
wedges
over
all
the
henry
hill
the
fighting
now
became
from
hand
to
hand
in
the
woods
and
in
the
open
small
squad
against
small
squad
that
night
a
man
insisted
that
this
phase
had
lasted
twelve
hours
he
said
that
he
remembered
how
the
sun
rose
over
the
henry
house
and
how
when
it
went
down
it
left
a
red
wall
behind
a
gun
on
the
mathews
hill
and
he
had
seen
both
events
from
a
ring
of
pines
out
of
which
he
with
two
others
was
keeping
twenty
rhode
islanders
ricketts
and
griffin
forty
men
upon
the
ground
twice
that
number
of

dead
or
disabled
tried
to
drag
away
the
guns
down
upon
them
roared
the
no
alignment
broken
and
fierce
as
a
mountain
torrent
as
thunder
run
when
the
rains
were
out
and
the
snows
had
melted
it
took
again
the
guns
it
met
a
regiment
from
the
northwest
also
stark
fighters
and
hunters
and
turned
it
back
it
seized
the
guns
and
drew
them
toward
the
pine

rising

all

blazed
and
thundered
from

at
the

out

a

a

a

hoarse
din
maine

wisconsin
and
minnesota
new

and
rhode
island
saw
and
heard
there
was
a
waver
as
of
grain
beneath
wind
over
the
field
then
the
grain
stood
stiff
against
the
wind
and
all
the
muskets
flamed
again
the
lost
brigade
of
the
army
of
the
shenandoah
seventeen
hundred
infantry
and
beckham
battery
swept
by
the
lewis

received
instructions
from

and
advanced
against
the
right
flank
kirby
smith
led
them
heated
exhausted
parched
with
thirst
the
regiments
came
upon
the
plateau
not
till
then
did
they
see
the
enemy
the
awaited
the
foe
the
giant
whose
voice
they
had
heard
at
manassas
they
saw
him
now
and
they
yelled
recognition
from
a
thousand
dusty
throats
came
a
cry
involuntary
individual
indescribably
fierce
a
high
and
shrill
and
wild
expression
of
anger
and
personal
opinion
there
was
the
enemy
they
saw
him
they
yelled
without
premeditation
without
cooperation
each
man
for
himself
yai
yaai
yaai
yai
yaai
that
cry
was
to
be
heard
on
more
than
two
thousand
battlefields
it
lasts
with
the
voice
of
stentor
and
with
the
horn
of
roland
it
has
gone
down
to
history
as
the
rebel
yell
as
they
reached
the
oak
woods
kirby
smith
was
shot
desperately
wounded
he
fell
from
his

elzey
took

the
troops
swept
out
by
the
chinn
house
upon
the
plateau
beckham
battery
unlimbered
and
came
with
decisive
effect
into
action
mcdowell
with
a
last
desperate
rally
formed
a
line
of
battle
a
gleaming
formidable
crescent
half
hid
by

down
upon

and
held
them
stuart
standing
in
his
stirrups
and
chanting
his
commands
rounded
the
base
of
the
hill
and
completed
the
rout
the
federals
turned
almost
to
a
man
their
officers
did
well
there
were
many
privates
of
a
like
complexion
sykes
regulars
not
now
upon
the
henry
hill
but
massed
across
the
branch
behaved
throughout
the
day
like
trained
and
disciplined
soldiers
no
field
could
have
witnessed
more
gallant
conduct
than
that
of
griffin
and
ricketts
heintzleman
had
been
conspicuously
energetic
franklin
and
willcox
had
done
their
best
mcdowell
himself
had
not
lacked
in
dash
and
grit
nor
to
say
sooth
in
strategy
it
was
the
federal
tactics
that
were
at
fault
but
all
the
troops
barring
sykes
and
ricketts
and
the
quite
unused
cavalry
were
raw
untried
undisciplined
few
were
good
marksmen
and
to
tell
the
truth
few
were
possessed
of
a
patriotism
that
would
stand
strain
that
virtue
awoke
later
in
the
army
of
the
potomac
it
was
not
present
in
force
on
the
field
of
bull
run
many
were
men
their
term
of
service
about
to
expire
and
in
their
minds
no
slightest
intention
of
reenlistment
they
were
close
kin
to
the
troops
whose
term
expiring
on
the
eve
of
battle
had
this
morning
marched
to
the
rear
to
the
sound
of
the
enemy
cannon
many
were
men
and
boys
merely
out
for
a
lark
and
almost
ludicrously
astonished
at
the
nature
of
the
business
new
englanders
had
come
to
battle
as
to
a
town
meeting
placid
farmers
and
village
youths
of
the
middle
states
had
never
placed
in
the
meadows
of
their
imaginations
events
like
these
while
the
more
alert
and
restless
folk
of
the
cities
discovered
that
the
newspapers
had
been
hardly
explicit
the
men
of
the
northwest
had
a
more
adequate
conception
there
was
promise
in
these
of
stark
fighting
to
all
is
to
be
added
a
rabble
of
camp
followers
of
sutlers
musicians
teamsters
servants
congressmen
in
carriages
even
here
and
there
a
congressman
wife
all
the
hurrah
and
vain
parade
the
strut
and
folly
and
civilian
ignorance
the
unwarlike
softness
and
the
misdirected
pride
with
which
these
greeks
had
set
out
to
take
in
a
night
that
troy
now
a
confusion
fell
upon
them
and
a
rout
such
as
was
never
seen
again
in
that
war
they
left
the
ten
guns
mute
enough
now
they
gave
no
heed
to
their
frantic
officers
they
turned
and
fled
one
moment
they
stood
that
charge
the
next
the
slopes
of
the
henry
hill
were
dark
blue
with
fugitives
there
was
no
cohesion
mere
inability
to
find
each
an
unencumbered
path
crowded
them
thus
they
looked
a
swarm
of
bees
but
there
was
no
spirit
of
the
hive
the
confederate
batteries
strewed
their
path
with
shot
and
shell
the
wild
and
singular
cry
first
heard
upon
that
field
rang
still
within
their
ears
they
reached
the
foot
of
the
hill
the
warrenton
turnpike
the
sudley
and
newmarket
road
and
the
marshy
fields
through
which
flowed
young
branch
up
to
this
moment
courtesy
might
have
called
the
movement
a
not
too
disorderly
retreat
but
now
upon
the
crowded
roads
and
through
the
bordering
meadows
it
became
mere
rout
a
panic
quite
simple
naked
and
unashamed
in
vain
the
officers
commanded
and
implored
in
vain
sykes
regulars
took
position
on
the
mathews
hill
a
nucleus
around
which
the
broken
troops
might
have
reformed
the
mob
had
neither
instinct
nor
desire
for
order
the
regulars
retreating
finally
with
the
rest
could
only
guard
the
rear
and
hinder
the
confederate
pursuit
the
panic
grew
ravens
in
the
air
brought
news
true
and
false
of
the
victors
beckham
battery
screaming
upon
the
heels
of
the
rout
was
magnified
a
there
was
no
doubt
that
battalions
of
artillery
were
hurling
unknown
and
deadly
missiles
blocking
the
way
to
the
potomac
jeb
stuart
was
following
on
the
sudley
road
and
another
cavalry
fiend
munford
on
the
turnpike
four
hundred
troopers
between
them
no
and
each
riding
like
the
headless
horseman
with
terror
in
his
hand
there
was
confederate
infantry
upon
the
turnpike
a
couple
of
regiments
a
legion
a
battery
they
were
making
for
a
point
they
knew
this
side
centreville
where
they
might
intercept
the
fleeing
army
it
behoved
the
army
to
get
there
first
to
cross
bull
run
to
cross
cub
run
and
to
reach
centreville
with
the
utmost
possible
expedition
the
ravens
croaked
of
the
confederate
troops
four
miles
down
bull
run
at
the
lower
fords
they
would
cross
they
would
fall
upon
miles
and
tyler
they
would
devour
alive
the
federal
reserves
they
would
get
first
to
centreville
that
catastrophe
at
least
the
mob
did
its
best
to
prevent
it
threw
away
its
muskets
it
dropped
its
colours
it
lightened
itself
of
accoutrements
it
fled
as
if
each
tired
and
inexperienced
grey
soldier
behind
it
had
been
death
in
the
apocalypse
each
man
ran
for
himself
swore
for
himself
prayed
for
himself
found
in
fate
a
personal
foe
and
strove
to
propitiate
her
with
the
rags
of
his
courage
the
men
stumbled
and
fell
lifted
themselves
and
ran
again
ambulances
wagons
carriages
blocked
the
road
they
streamed
around
and
under
these
riderless
horses
tore
the
veil
of
blue
artillery
teams
unguided
maddened
infected
by
all
this
human
fear
rent
it
further
and
behind
them
the
folds
heard
again
the
confederate
yell
centreville
centreville
first
and
a
little
food
all
the
haversacks
had
been
thrown
away
but
no
stopping
at
centreville
no
beyond
centreville
the
potomac
washington
home
and
safety
maine
or
massachusetts
new
york
or
vermont
as
the
case
might
be
the
sun
went
down
and
left
the
fleeing
army
streaming
northward
by
every
road
or
footpath
which
it
conceived
might
lead
to
the
potomac
in
the
summer
dusk
back
at
the
lewis
house
a
breathless
courier
brought
to
beauregard
a
circumstantial
statement
from
major
rhett
at
manassas
general
the
federal
reserves
have
been
observed
crossing
below
maclean
a
strong
column
they
take
us
in
the
rear
or
they
fall
upon
manassas
that
mcdowell
would
use
his
numerous
reserves
was
so
probable
a
card
that
bonham
and
longstreet
started
upon
the
pursuit
were
recalled
ewell
and
holmes
had
just
reached
the
battlefield
they
were
faced
about
and
beauregard
with
them
back
to
maclean
ford
to
find
no
miles
or
richardson
or
runyon
for
them
to
attack
it
was
a
mistake
and
a
confusion
of
identity
the
crossing
troops
were
confederates

the

were
much
exhausted
the
routed
army
by
now
at
centreville
beauregard
did
the
only
thing
that
could
be
done
ordered
the
men
to
halt
and
bivouac
for
the
night
in
the
woods
about
the
stream
back
upon
the
sudley
road
stuart
and
his
troopers
followed
for
twelve
miles
the
fugitive
army
there
was
a
running
fight
here
and
there
the
enemy
was
cut
off
great
spoil
and
many
prisoners
were
taken
encumbered
with
all
of
these
stuart
at

called
off

and
halted
for
the
night
at
the

with
a
handful
of
the
black
horse
and
the
chesterfield

and

meeting
the
retreat
as
it
debouched
into
the
warrenton
turnpike
heaped
rout
on
rout
and
confounded
confusion
a
wagon
was
upset
upon
the
bridge
it
became
impassable
and
panic
found
that
she
must
get
away
as
best
she
might
she
left
her
carriages
her
wagons
of
subsistence
and
her
wagons
of
ammunition
her
guns
and
their
caissons
her
flags
and
her
wounded
in

she
cut
the
traces
of
the
horses
and
freed
them
from
pleasure
carriage

carriage
ammunition
wagon
and
ambulance
with
these
horses
and
afoot
she
dashed
through
the
water
of
cub
run
and
with
the
long
wail
of
the
helpless
behind
her
fled
northward
through
the
dusk
a
little
later
bugles
sounding
here
and
there
beneath
the
stars
called
off
the
pursuit
the

of

history
has
not
been
backward
with
a
question
why
did
not
the
confederate
forces
press
the
pursuit
to
the
potomac
miles
away
why
did
they
not
cross
that
river
why
did
they
not
take
washington
history
depones
that
it
was
a
city
and
that
it
might
have
been
stormed
and
so
perhaps
the
great
war
ended
ere
it
had
well
begun
why
did
you
not
pursue
from
manassas
to
washington
the
tongue
of
the
case
answers
thus
we
were
a
victorious
army
but
we
had
fought
long
and
hard
we
had
not
many
fresh
troops
even
those
which
were
not
engaged
had
been
marching
and
countermarching
the
enemy
had
many
more
than
we
heavy
reserves
to
whom
panic
might
or
might
not
have
been
communicated
these
were
between
us
and
centreville
and
the
night
had
fallen
our
cavalry
was
the
best
in
the
land
but
cruelly
small
in
force
and
very
weary
by
that
midnight
we
were
scant
of
provisions
scant
of
transportation
scant
of
ammunition
what
if
the
federal
reserves
had
not
stood
but
had
fled
with
the
rest
and
we
had
in
some
fashion
achieved
the
potomac
there
were
strong
works
at
arlington
and
alexandria
lined
with
troops
and
in
easy
distance
were
patterson
and
his
unused
men
there
was
a
river
a
mile
wide
patrolled
by
gunboats
and
beyond
it
a
city
with
how
many
troops
we
knew
not
certainly
with
strong
earthworks
and
mounted
guns
being
only
men
and
not
clairvoyants
we
did
not
know
that
the
city
was
so
crazed
with
fear
that
perhaps
after
all
had
we
ever
gotten
there
we
might
have
stormed
it
with
a
few
weary
regiments
we
never
saw
the
like
in
our
own
capital
at
any
after
date
and
we
did
not
know
we
were
under
arms
from
dawn
until
the
stars
came
out
we
had
fought
through
the
heat
of
a
july
day
in
virginia
we
were
hungry
we
were
thirsty
we
were
drunk
with
need
of
rest
most
of
us
were
under
we
had
met
and
vanquished
heavy
odds
but
we
ourselves
like
those
who
fled
were
soldiers
all
untried
victory
disorganized
us
as
defeat
disorganized
them
not
in
the
same
measure
but
to
the
extent
that
all
commands
were
much
broken
men
astray
in
the
darkness
seeking
their
companies
companies
calling
out
the
number
of
their
regiments
most
of
us
went
hungry
that
night
and
all
around
were
the
dead
and
wounded
and
above
us
like
a
pall
the
strangeness
of
this
war
at
last
the
july
night
passed
like
a
fevered
dream
men
sleeping
on
the
earth
men
seeking
their
commands
men
riding
to
and
fro
men
wandering
with
lanterns
over
the
battlefield
at
three
came
down
the
rain
it
was
as
though
the
heavens
were
opened
no
one
had
ever
seen
such
a
downpour
all
day
long
it
rained
and
in
the
rain
we
buried
our
comrades
there
were
two
brothers
holmes
and
tucker
conrad
boys
from
the
university
holmes
was
shot
through
the
heart
just
on
the
edge
of
a
ravine
on
the
henry
hill
tucker
across
the
ravine
saw
him
fall
he
was
down
one
side
and
up
the
other
before
a
man
could
draw
breath
he
lifted
holmes
and
as
he
did
so
he
too
was
killed
we
found
them
lying
in
each
other
arms
holmes
smiling
and
we
buried
them
so
we
buried
many
friends
and
comrades
and
kindred
we
were
all
more
or
less
akin
and
perhaps
being
young
to
war
that
solemn
battlefield
loomed
to
us
so
large
that
it
obstructed
the
view
of
the
routed
invasion
now
across
the
potomac
out
of
virginia
we
held
then
and
we
hold
still
that
our
generals
that
day
were
sagacious
and
brave
and
we
think
history
may
take
their
word
for
it
that
any
effective
pursuit
looking
to
the
crossing
of
the
potomac
was
a
military
impossibility
it
is
true
that
stonewall
jackson
as
history
reminds
us
was
heard
to
exclaim
while
the
surgeon
was
dressing
his
hand
me
ten
thousand
fresh
troops
and
i
will
be
in
washington
but
there
were
not
the
ten
thousand
troops
to
give
chapter
ix
winchester
the
december
afternoon
was
drawing
to
a
quiet
close
the
season
had
proved
extraordinarily
mild
it
seemed
indian
summer
still
rather
than
only
a
fortnight
from
christmas
farming
folk
prophesied
a
cold
january
while
the
neighbourhood
negroes
held
that
the
unusual
warmth
proceeded
from
the
comet
which
blazed
this
year
in
the
skies
an
old
woman
whom
the
children
called
a
witch
sat
in
the
sun
on
her
doorstep
and
shook
her
head
at
every
a
green
christmas
makes
a
fat
down
pussy
down
down
a
green
christmas
makes
a
fat
graveyard
did
ye
hear
the
firing
yesterday
an
amethyst
haze
filled
the
valley
town
of
winchester
ordinarily
in
weather
such
as
this
the
wide
streets
had
a
dream
quality
and
the
gardens
where
the
chrysanthemums
yet
lingered
and
the
brick
sidewalks
all
strewn
with
russet
leaves
and
the
faint
smell
of
wood
smoke
and
the
old
gilt
of
the
sunshine
all
carried
back
as
to
some
vanished
song
or
story
sweet
while
it
lasted
but
if
this
was
true
once
of
winchester
and
might
be
true
again
it
was
hardly
true
of
of
winchester
in
december
of
winchester
with
jackson
commanding
the
department
of
the
valley
quartered
in
the
town
and
the
stonewall
brigade
commanded
by
garnett
encamped
upon
its
edge
and
the
valley
troopers
commanded
by
ashby
flashing
by
on
their
way
to
reconnoitre
the
federal
general
banks
of
winchester
with
bands
playing
dixie
with
great
wagons
going
endlessly
through
the
streets
with
soldiers
passing
and
repassing
or
drilling
drilling
drilling
in
the
fields
without
or
thronging
the
taylor
house
or
coming
to
supper
in
the
hospitable
brick
mansions
where
the
pretty
girls
could
never
never
never
look
aught
but
kindly
on
any
man
who
wore
the
grey
of
winchester
in
short
in
war
time
the
sun
slipped
low
in
the
heavens
out
of
the
purple
haze
to
the
south
a
wagon
from
staunton
way
drawn
by
oxen
and
piled
high
with
forage
came
up
a
side
street
the
ancient
negro
who
drove
was
singing
i

the
wagon
passed
on
a
picket
squad
swung
up
the
middle
of
the
street
turned
and
went
marching
toward
the
sunset
the
corner
house
was
a
warehouse
fitted
for
a
hospital
faces
showed
at
the
windows
when
for
a
moment
a
sash
was
lifted
a
racking
cough
made
itself
heard
just
now
no
wounded
lodged
in
the
warehouse
but
all
the
diseases
were
there
with
which
raw
troops
are
scourged
there
were
measles
and
mumps
there
were
fevers
typhoid
and
malarial
there
were
intestinal
troubles
there
were
pleurisy
and
pneumonia
some
of
the
illnesses
were
slight
and
some
of
the
men
would
be
discharged
by
death
the
glow
of
the
sun
made
the
window
glass
red
it
was
well
for
the
place
needed
every
touch
of
cheer
the
door
opened
and
two
ladies
came
out
the
younger
with
an
empty
basket
the
oppression
of
the
place
they
were
leaving
stayed
with
them
for
some
distance
down
the
wider
street
but
at
last
in
the
rosy
light
with
a
bugle
sounding
from
the
camp
without
the
town
the
spirits
of
the
younger
at
least
revived
she
drew
a
long
breath
well
as
long
as
will
is
in
a
more
comfortable
place
and
is
getting
better
and
richard
is
well
and
strong
and
they
all
say
he
is
a
born
soldier
and
his
men
adore
him
and
there
is
a
battle
and
if
there
were
we
win
and
this
weather
lasts
and
a
colonel
and
a
captain
and
two
privates
are
coming
to
supper
and
one
of
them
draws
and
the
other
has
a
voice
like
an
angel
and
my
silk
dress
is
almost
as
good
as
new
i
ca
be
terribly
unhappy
mother
margaret
cleave
laughed
i
do
want
you
to
be
i
am
not
unhappy
myself
despite
those
poor
poor
boys
in
the
warehouse
i
am
thankful
about
will
and
i
am
thankful
about
richard
and
war
is
war
and
we
must
all
stand
it
we
must
stand
it
with
just
as
high
and
exquisite
a
courage
as
we
can
muster
if
we
can
add
a
gaiety
that
is
thoughtless
so
much
the
better
we
got
to
do
it
for
virginia
and
for
the
south
yes
and
for
every
soul
who
is
dear
to
us
and
for
ourselves
i
lace
your
silk
dress
and
i
play
fairfax
accompaniments
with
much
pleasure
and
we
come
back
to
the
warehouse
with
a
full
basket
i
wish
the
coffee
was
not
getting
so
low
a
soldier
a
staff
officer
equipped
for
the
road
came
rapidly
up
the
brick
sidewalk
overtook
the
two
and
spoke
their
names
holding
out
his
hand
i
was
sure
was
you
nowadays
one
meets
one
world
in
no
matter
how
unlikely
a
place
not
that
winchester
is
an
unlikely
place
dear
and
hospitable
little
town
nor
perhaps
should
i
be
surprised
i
knew
that
captain
cleave
was
in
the
stonewall
brigade
he
took
the
basket
from
miriam
and
walked
beside
them
my
youngest
son
has
been
ill
said
margaret
he
is
in
the
kind
friends
took
him
home
and
cared
for
him
but
miriam
and
i
were
unhappy
at
three
oaks
so
we
closed
the
house
and
came
will
always
was
a
baby
volunteered
miriam
when
the
fever
made
him
delirious
and
they
thought
he
was
going
to
die
he
kept
calling
for
mother
and
sometimes
he
called
for
me
now
he
better
and
the
sister
of
a
man
in
his
mess
is
reading
aloud
to
him
and
spoiled
to
death
richard
always
did
spoil
him
her
mother
smiled
i
do
think
he
really
spoiled
not
that
is
by
when
did
you
come
to
town
major
stafford
last
night
answered
stafford
from
general
loring
near
monterey
i
am
the
advance
of
the
army
of
the
northwest
we
are
ordered
to
join
general
jackson
and
ten
days
or
so
should
see
the
troops
in
winchester
what
is
going
to
happen
then
dear
madam
i
do
not
know
miriam
chose
to
remain
petulant
general
jackson
is
the
most
dreadful
martinet
he
drills
and
drills
and
drills
the
poor
men
until
they
too
tired
to
stand
he
makes
people
get
up
at
dawn
in
december
and
he
let
officers
leave
camp
without
a
pass
and
he
has
prayer
meetings
all
the
time
ever
so
many
people
think
he
crazy
miriam
but
they
do
mother
of
course
not
richard
richard
knows
how
to
be
a
soldier
and
will
will
would
be
loyal
to
a
piece
of
cement
out
of
the
virginia
military
institute
and
of
course
the
stonewall
brigade
say
it
nor
the
rockbridge
artillery
nor
any
of
ashby
men
soldiers
too
but
i
heard
the
say
it
maury
stafford
laughed
then
i
wo
i
only
confide
to
you
that
the
army
of
the
northwest
thinks
that
general
jackson
is
is
well
is
general
jackson
to
burn
our
stores
of
subsistence
to
leave
unguarded
the
passes
along
a
hundred
miles
of
mountain
to
abandon
quarters
just
established
to
get
our
sick
somehow
to
the
rear
and
to
come
up
here
upon
some
wild
winter
campaign
or
other
all
on
the
representation
of
the
rather
singular
commander
of
the
army
of
the
valley
he
took
off
his
cap
and
lifted
his
handsome
head
to
the
breeze
from
the
west
but
what
can
you
do
with
professors
of
military
institutes
and
generals
with
one
battle
to
their
credit
nothing
when
they
have
managed
to
convert
to
their
way
of
thinking
both
the
commanding
general
and
the
government
at
richmond
you
look
grave
cleave
i
should
not
have
said
that
i
know
pray
forget
it
and
do
believe
that
i
am
given
to
such
indiscretions
he
laughed
there
were
representations
which
i
was
to
make
to
general
jackson
well
i
made
them
in
point
of
fact
i
made
them
but
an
hour
ago
hence
this
unbecoming
temper
they
were
received
quite
in
the
manner
of
a
stone
wall
without
comment
and
without
removal
from
the
ground
occupied
well
why
not
expect
the
thing
to
show
its
nature
is
this
pleasant
old
house
your
goal
they
had
come
to
a
white
old
mansion
with
steps
running
up
to
a
narrow
yard
and
a
small
porch
yes
we
are
staying
here
will
you
not
come
in
thank
you
no
i
ride
as
far
as
woodstock
i
have
not
seen
captain
cleave
indeed
i
have
not
seen
him
since
last
spring
he
is
acting
just
now
as
aide
to
general
jackson
you
have
been
all
this
while
with
general
magruder
on
the
peninsula
yes
until
lately
we
missed
manassas
he
stood
beside
the
garden
wall
his
gauntleted
hand
on
the
gatepost
a
creeper
bearing
yet
a
few
leaves
hung
from
a
tree
above
and
one
of
the
crimson
points
touched
his
grey
cap
i
am
now
on
general
loring
staff
where
he
goes
at
present
i
go
and
where
general
jackson
goes
apparently
we
all
go
heigho
how
do
you
like
war
miss
miriam
miriam
regarded
him
with
her
air
of
a
brown
and
gold
gilliflower
she
thought
him
very
handsome
and
oh
she
liked
the
cap
and
the
fine
white
gauntlet
there
is
something
to
be
said
on
both
sides
she
stated
sedately
i
should
like
it
very
much
did
not
you
all
run
into
danger
stafford
looked
at
her
amused
but
some
of
us
run
out
again
ah
cleave
came
from
the
house
and
down
the
path
to
the
gate
moving
in
a
red
sunset
glow
beneath
trees
on
which
yet
hung
a
few
russet
leaves
he
greeted
his
mother
and
sister
then
turned
with
courtesy
to
stafford
sandy
pendleton
told
me
you
were
in
town
from
general
loring
are
you
not
you
are
gathering
all
our
mountain
laurels
gauley

and
greenbriar
and
news
of
the
allegheny
engagement
you
seem
to
be
bent
said
stafford
on
drawing
us
from
the
monterey
line
before
we
can
gather
any
more
we
will
be
here
next
week
you
do
not
like
the
idea
the
other
shrugged
i
why
should
i
care
it
is
war
to
go
where
you
are
sent
but
this
weather
is
much
too
good
to
last
and
i
fail
to
see
what
can
be
done
to
the
northward
when
winter
is
once
let
loose
and
we
leave
the
passes
open
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
rosecrans
from
pushing
a
force
through
to
staunton
that
is
the
best
thing
that
could
happen
draw
them
into
the
middle
valley
and
they
are
ours
stafford
made
a
gesture
ducdame
ducdame
cleave
there
is
no
help
for
it
we
are
bewitched
and
all
by
a
stone
wall
in
an
old
cadet
cap
cleave
laughed
no
no
but
it
is
i
think
apparent
you
will
not
go
in
i
will
walk
with
you
then
as
far
as
the
hotel
margaret
cleave
held
out
her
hand
major
stafford
we
think
day
and
night
of
all
you
soldiers
god
bless
you
all
wherever
you
may
be
in
the
sunset
light
the
two
men
turned
their
faces
toward
the
taylor
house
it
is
a
good
thing
to
have
a
mother
said
stafford
mine
died
when
i
was
a
little
well
what
do
you
think
of
affairs
in
general
i
think
that
last
summer
we
won
a
pyrrhic
victory
i
share
your
opinion
it
was
disastrous
how
confident
we
are
with
our
to
four
our
not
quantity
our
contempt
for
mass
to
listen
to
the
newspapers
one
would
suppose
that
the
fighting
animal
was
never
bred
north
of
the
potomac
maryland
alone
an
honourable
exception
france
and
england
too
they
be
our
active
allies
not
a
minute
later
than
april
fool
day
you
are
bitter
it
is
the
case
is
it
not
yes
said
cleave
gravely
and
the
blockade
is
daily
growing
more
effective
and
yet
before
we
are
closed
in
a
ring
of
fire
we
do
not
get
our
cotton
out
nor
our
muskets
in
send
the
cotton
to
europe
and
sell
it
and
so
fill
the
treasury
with
honest
gold
not
with
this
delusion
of
wealth
these
sheafs
of
promises
to
pay
the
government
is
issuing
five
million
bales
of
cotton
idle
in
the
south
with
every
nerve
strained
with
daring
commensurate
to
the
prize
we
could
get
them
out
even
now
it
will
be
too
late
the
blockade
will
be
complete
and
we
shall
rest
as
isolated
as
the
other
side
of
the
moon
well
few
countries
or
men
are
wise
till
after
the
event
you
are
not
bitter
cleave
shook
his
head
i
do
not
believe
in
bitterness
and
if
the
government
is
not
altogether
wise
so
are
few
others
the
people
are
heroic
we
will
see
what
we
will
see
i
had
a
letter
from
the
peninsula
the
other
day
fauquier
cary
is
there
with
his
legion
he
says
that
mcclellan
will
organize
and
organize
and
organize
again
until
springtime
it
what
he
does
best
then
if
only
he
can
be
set
going
he
will
bring
into
the
field
an
army
that
is
an
army
and
if
he
not
thwarted
by
his
own
government
he
try
to
reach
richmond
from
the
correct
direction
and
that
by
sea
to
old
point
and
up
both
banks
of
the
james
all
of
which
means
heavy
fighting
on
the
peninsula
so
cary
thinks
and
i
dare
say
he
knows
his
man
they
were
classmates
and
served
together
in
mexico
they
approached
the
old
colonnaded
hotel
stafford
horse
stood
at
the
rack
a
few
soldiers
were
about
the
place
and
down
the
street
in
the
warm
dusk
a
band
was
playing
you
ride
up
the
valley
said
cleave
when
you
return
to
winchester
you
must
let
me
serve
you
in
any
way
i
can
you
are
very
good
how
red
the
sunsets
are
look
at
that
bough
across
the
sky
were
you
asked
cleave
were
you
in
albemarle
this
autumn
yes
for
one
day
in
october
the
country
looked
its
loveliest
the
old
ride
through
the
woods
by
the
mill
i
remember
said
cleave
my
cousins
were
well
quite
well
enchanted
princesses
guarded
by
the
sable
julius
the
old
place
was
all
one
drift
of
red
and
yellow
leaves
they
reached
the
hotel
cleave
spoke
abruptly
i
am
to
report
presently
at
headquarters
so
i
will
say
here
the
two
touched
hands
a
pleasant
gallop
you
have
a
moon
and
the
road
is
good
if
you
see
randolph
of
taliaferro
tell
him
to
bring
that
book
of
mine
he
has
he
walked
away
stalwart
in
the
afterglow
stafford
watched
him
from
the
porch
under
other
circumstances
he
thought
i
might
have
liked
you
well
enough
now
i
do
not
care
if
you
lead
your
mad
general
next
mad
charge
the
night
fell
mild
as
milk
with
a
great
white
moon
above
the
treetops
it
made
like
the
small
grey
house
with
pointed
windows
occupied
this
december
by
stonewall
jackson
a
clock
in
the
hall
was
striking
nine
as
cleave
lifted
the
knocker
an
old
negro
came
to
the
door
jim
will
you
tell
the
general
some
one
spoke
from
down
the
hall
is
that
captain
cleave
come
here
sir
passing
an
open
door
through
which
could
be
seen
a
clerk
writing
and
an
aide
with
his
hands
behind
him
studying
an
engraving
of
washington
crossing
the
delaware
cleave
went
on
to
the
room
whence
the
voice
had
issued
come
in
and
close
the
door
it
said
again
the
room
was
small
furnished
with
a
spartan
simplicity
but
with
two
good
lamps
and
with
a
log
of
hickory
burning
on
the
hearth
a
table
held
a
number
of
outspread
maps
and
three
books
the
bible
a
dictionary
and
napoleon
maxims
general
jackson
was
seated
on
a
small
chair
beside
the
table
by
the
window
stood
a
soldier
in
nondescript
grey
attire
much
the
worse
for
mud
and
brambles
captain
cleave
said
the
general
were
you
ever
on
the
chesapeake
and
ohio
canal
no
sir
do
you
know
the
stretch
of
the
potomac
north
of
us
i
have
ridden
over
the
country
between
harper
ferry
and
bath
do
you
know
where
is
dam
no
yes
sir
come
nearer
gold
said
the
general
go
on
with
your
report
i
counted
thirty
boats
going
up
general
said
allan
all
empty
there
a
pretty
constant
stream
of
them
just
now
they
get
the
coal
at
cumberland
and
turn
back
toward
washington
in
about
ten
days
it
is
estimated
that
a
thousand
tons
a
day
will
go
down
the
canal
some
of
it
for
private
use
in
washington
but
the
greater
part
for
the
warships
and
the
factories
the
flatboats
carry
a
large
amount
of
forage
the
yankees
are
using
them
too
to
transport
troops
there
is
no
attempt
to
rebuild
the
section
of
the
baltimore
and
ohio
that
we
destroyed
they
seem
willing
to
depend
upon
the
canal
but
if
dam
no
were
cut
it
would
dry
that
canal
like
a
bone
for
miles
the
river
men
say
that
if
any
considerable
breach
were
made
it
could
not
be
mended
this
winter
as
for
the
troops
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
he
drew
out
a
slip
of
paper
and
read
from
it
upon
the
maryland
side
of
the
potomac
from
point
of
rocks
to
hancock
say
hundred
men
two
thirds
of
this
force
above
dam
no
at
williamsport
colonel
leonard
with
three
regiments
and
several
guns
at
four
locks
a
troop
at
dam
no
several
companies
of
infantry
encamped
at
hancock
a
considerable
force
perhaps
two
regiments
a
detachment
at
clear
spring
cavalry
over
against
sleepy
creek
cherry
run
and
sir
john
run
concentration
easy
at
any
point
up
and
down
the
river
a
system
of
signals
both
for
the
other
side
and
for
any
of
their
scouts
who
may
have
crossed
to
this
troops
reported
below
point
of
rocks
and
at
the
mouth
of
the
monocacy
the
remainder
of
general
banks
division
perhaps
fifteen
thousand
men
in
winter
quarters
at
frederick
city
that
is
all
i
have
to
report
general
very
good
said
jackson
give
me
your
memorandum
captain
cleave
yes
sir
stonewall
jackson
rose
from
the
chair
and
walked
with
his
slow
stiff
stride
to
the
mantelpiece
from
behind
a
china
vase
he
took
a
saucer
holding
a
lemon
which
had
been
cut
in
two
then
standing
very
rigidly
before
the
fire
he
slowly
and
meditatively
sucked
the
lemon
cleave
beside
the
table
had
a
whimsical
thought
the
general
about
to
open
slightly
the
door
of
reticence
and
impart
information
was
stimulating
himself
to
the
effort
he
put
the
lemon
down
and
returned
to
the
table
captain
cleave
while
i
am
waiting
for
general
loring
i
propose
to
break
this
dam
dam
no
yes
sir
i
shall
go
almost
immediately
to
martinsburg
taking
with
me
general
garnett
brigade
and
two
of
the
rockbridge
guns
it
will
be
necessary
to
cover
the
operation
the
work
may
take
several
days
by
the
time
the
dam
is
broken
general
loring
will
be
up
his
eyes
moved
toward
the
mantel
allan
gold
stepped
noiselessly
across
the
room
and
brought
back
the
saucer
with
the
lemon
setting
it
on
the
table
thank
you
said
jackson
gently
and
sucked
the
acid
treasure
with
this
reinforcement
i
am
going
against
kelly
at
romney
if
god
gives
us
the
victory
there
i
shall
strike
past
kelly
at
rosecrans
i
hope
that
he
will
give
it
sir
that
part
of
virginia
is
worth
making
an
effort
for
that
is
my
opinion
sir
while
i
march
toward
romney
the
government
at
washington
may
thrust
general
banks
across
the
potomac
i
do
not
want
him
in
my
rear
nor
between
me
and
general
johnston
he
again
sucked
the
lemon
the
secretary
of
war
writes
that
our
spies
report
a
clamour
at
washington
for
some
movement
before
spring
it
is
thought
at
richmond
that
general
banks
has
been
ordered
to
cross
the
potomac
as
soon
as
practicable
effecting
if
possible
a
junction
with
kelly
and
descending
upon
winchester
general
mcclellan
at
the
same
time
to
advance
against
general
johnston
at
manassas
maybe
it
is
so
maybe
not
of
one
thing
i
am
sure
general
mcclellan
will
not
move
until
general
banks
is
on
this
side
of
the
river
yesterday
colonel
ashby
captured
a
courier
of
bearing
a
letter
to
banks
the
letter
which
demands
an
answer
asks
to
know
explicitly
what
are
banks
instructions
from
washington
he
put
the
lemon
down
captain
cleave
i
very
particularly
wish
to
know
what
are
general
banks
instructions
from
washington
were
jarrow
here
he
would
find
out
for
me
but
i
have
sent
jarrow
on
other
business
i
want
to
know
within
four
days
there
was
a
moment
stillness
in
the
room
then
very
well
sir
said
cleave
i
remember
said
jackson
that
you
sent
me
the
scout
here
he
does
good
service
he
is
at
your
disposal
for
the
next
few
days
drawing
ink
and
paper
toward
him
he
wrote
a
few
lines
go
to
the
adjutant
for
anything
you
may
need
cleave
on
special
here
too
is
the
name
and
address
of
a
catholic
priest
in
frederick
city
he
may
be
depended
upon
for
some
readiness
of
mind
and
for
that
is
all
i
think
captain
in
four
days
if
you
please
you
will
find
me
somewhere
between
martinsburg
and
the
river
you
spoke
sir
said
cleave
of
a
captured
dispatch
from
general
kelly
may
i
see
it
jackson
took
it
from
a
box
upon
the
table
there
it
is
do
you
object
sir
to
its
reaching
general
banks
the
other
retook
the
paper
glanced
over
it
and
gave
it
back
no
not
if
it
goes
by
a
proper
courier
has
the
former
courier
been
sent
to
richmond
not
yet
he
wrote
another
line
this
if
you
wish
to
see
the
courier
that
is
all
sir
that
is
all
captain
within
four
days
near
martinsburg
the
two
soldiers
saluted
and
left
the
room
going
softly
through
the
hall
past
the
door
where
the
aide
was
now
studying
the
capture
of
andre
and
out
into
the
moonlight
they
walked
down
the
long
board
path
to
the
gate
unlatched
this
and
turned
their
faces
toward
the
camp
for
some
distance
they
were
as
silent
as
the
street
before
them
then
if
ever
you
had
taught
school
said
allan
you
would
know
how
headings
out
of
reading
books
and
sentences
that
you
set
for
the
children
to
copy
have
a
way
of
starting
up
before
you
at
every
corner
post
of
honour
is
the
post
of
i
can
see
that
in
round
hand
but
what
i
ca
see
is
how
you
are
going
to
do
it
i
want
said
the
other
one
quite
to
myself
then
i
think
i
know
here
the
picket
the
word
the
stonewall
brigade
was
encamped
in
the
fields
just
without
the
town
it
was
early
in
the
war
and
there
were
yet
tents
long
line
of
canvas
a
stretching
in
the
moonlight
far
over
the
rolling
ground
where
the
tents
failed
there
had
been
erected
tiny
cabins
very
rude
with
abundant
ventilation
and
the
strangest
chimneys
a
few
field
officers
were
quartered
in
the
town
and
jackson
had
with
him
there
his
permanent
staff
but
captains
and
lieutenants
stayed
with
the
men
the
general
of
them
all
ruled
with
a
rod
of
iron
for
the
most
part
it
swayed
lightly
with
a
certain
moral
effect
only
over
the
head
of
the
rank
and
file
but
it
grew
to
a
crushing
beam
for
the
who
did
not
with
alacrity
habitually
attend
to
his
every
duty
great
or
small
the
the
popinjay
the
intractable
the
the
remonstrant
the
thought
the
is
due
to
my
dignity
none
of
these
flourished
in
the
army
of
the
valley
the
tendencies
had
been
there
of
course
they
came
up
like
the
flowers
of
spring
but
each
poor
bloom
as
it
appeared
met
an
icy
blast
the
root
beneath
learned
to
send
up
to
the
sky
a
sturdier
growth
company
a
virginia
numbered
in
its
ranks
men
who
knew
all
about
log
cabins
it
was
well
lodged
and
the
captain
hut
did
it
credit
richard
cleave
and
allan
entering
found
a
fire
and
tullius
nodding
beside
it
at
their
step
he
roused
himself
rose
and
put
on
another
log
he
was
a
negro
of
sixty
years
tall
and
hale
a
dignified
master
of
foraging
a
being
simple
and
taciturn
and
strong
with
a
love
for
every
clod
of
earth
at
three
oaks
where
he
had
been
born
cleave
spoke
where

for
twenty
minutes
he
propped
his

on
his
hands
and
stared
at
the
boards
allan
seated
himself
on
a
box
beside
the
fire
tullius
took
from
a
flat
heated
stone
a
battered
tin
poured
into
an
earthenware
cup
some
smoking
mixture
and
brought
it
to
the

an
impromptu
cupboard
he
brought
a
plate
of
small
round
cakes
miriam

spoke
from
the
table
his
voice
was
dreamy
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
surface
before
him
as
though
he
were
studying
ocean
depths
tullius

me
a
dozen
coffee
berries
er
of
coffee
you

tullius
brought
a
small
tin
box
tilted
it
and
poured
on
the
table
something
like
the
required
number
thar
all
thar
is
he
returned
to
his
corner
of
the
fire
and
it
purred
and
flamed
upon
the
crazy
hearth
between
him
and
the
scout
the
latter
his
rifle
across
his
knees
now
watched
the
flames
now
the
man
at
the
table
cleave
had
strung
the
coffee
berries
along
a
crack
between
the
boards
now
he
advanced
one
small
brown
object
now
retired
another
now
crossed
them
from
one
side
to
the
other
following
these
manoeuvres
he
sat
with
his
chin
upon
his
hand
for
five
minutes
then
began
to
make
a
circle
with
the
berries
he
worked
slowly
dropping
point
after
point
in
place
the
two
ends
met
he
rose
from
the
table

he
and

went
out
together
tullius
restored
the
coffee
berries
to
the
tin
box
and
the
box
to
the
cupboard
sat
down
by
the
fire
and
fell
again
into
a
nodding
dream
of
three
oaks
of
the
garden
and
of
his
grandchildren
in
the

chapter
x
lieutenant
mcneil
the
williamsport
came
slowly
across
the
potomac
from
the
maryland
to
the
virginia
side
the
clear
deep
water
lay
faintly
blue
beneath
the
winter
sky
and
the
woods
came
so
close
that
long
branches
of
sycamore
swept
the
flood
in
that
mild
season
every
leaf
had
not
fallen
up
and
down
the
river
here
the
dull
red
of
an
oak
met
the
eye
and
there
the
faded
gold
of
a
willow
the
flatboat
a
brown
shadow
beneath
a
creaking
wire
and
pulley
came
slowly
to
the
southern
side
of
the
stream
the
craft
squat
to
the
water
and
railed
on
either
side
was
in
the
charge
of
an
old
negro
clustered
in
the
middle
of
the
boat
appeared
a
tall
marylander
in
blue
jeans
two
soldiers
in
blue
cloth
and
a
small
darky
in
a
shirt
of
blue
gingham
all
these
stared
at
a
few
yards
of
virginia
road
shelving
and
overarched
by
an
oak
that
was
yet
touched
with
maroon
and
stared
at
a
horseman
in
high
boots
a
blue
army
overcoat
and
a
blue
and
gold
cap
who
mounted
upon
a
great
bay
horse
was
waiting
at
the
water
edge
the
boat
crept
into
the
shadow
of
the
trees
one
of
the
blue
soldiers
stood
watchfully
his
hands
upon
an
enfield
rifle
the
other
a
who
had
been
leaning
against
the
rail
straightened
himself
and
spoke
being
now
within
a
few
feet
of
the
man
on
horseback
your
signal
was
all
right
he
said
and
your
coat
all
right
but
how
did
your
coat
get
on
this
side
of
the
river
it
been
on
this
side
for
some
time
explained
the
man
on
horseback
with
a
smile
ever
since
uncle
sam
presented
it
to
me
at
wheeling
and
that
was
before
bull
run
he
addressed
the
negro
is
this
the
fastest
this
boat
can
travel
i
been
waiting
here
half
an
hour
the
persisted
your
coat
all
right
and
your
all
right
and
if
it
had
ha
been
our
sharpshooters
would
left
much
of
you
by
now
your
coat
all
right
and
your
signal
all
right
but
i
damned
if
your
voice
ai
southern
the
head
of
the
boat
touched
the
shore
and
the
dress
of
the
horseman
was
seen
more
lieutenant
ended
the
speaker
with
a
change
of
tone
the
rider
dismounting
led
his
horse
down
the
yard
or
two
of
road
and
into
the
boat
so
dandy
just
think
it
the
south
branch
and
come
on
thirty
miles
since
breakfast
and
still
so
gaily
horse
and
man
entered
the
boat
which
moved
out
into
the
stream
i
was
once
stated
the
though
still
in
the
proper
tone
of
respect
toward
a
lieutenant
i
was
once
in
virginia
for
a
month
down
on
the
pamunkey
and
the
people
all
said
they
say
it
still
answered
the
rider
not
so
much
though
in
my
part
of
virginia
it
tuckahoe
not
cohee
i
from
the
valley
of
the
south
branch
between
romney
and
moorefield
the
heretofore
silent
blue
soldier
shifted
his
rifle
what
in
hell
he
muttered
the
looked
at
the
virginia
shore
looked
at
the
stranger
standing
with
his
arm
around
his
horse
neck
and
looked
at
the
williamsport
landing
and
the
cannon
frowning
from
hill
in
the
back
of
his
head
there
formed
a
little
picture
a
drumhead
a
provost
guard
a
tree
and
a
rope
then
came
the
hand
of
reason
and
wiped
the
picture
away
pshaw
spies
do
southern
and
by
jiminy
one
might
smile
with
his
lips
but
he
smile
with
his
eyes
like
that
and
he
lieutenant
and
there
such
a
thing
tom
miller
as
being
too
smart
he
leaned
upon
the
rail
and
being
an
observant
fellow
he
looked
to
see
if
the
lieutenant
hand
trembled
at
all
where
it
lay
upon
the
horse
neck
it
did
not
it
rested
as
quiet
as
an
empty
glove
the
tall
marylander
began
to
speak
with
a
slow
volubility
there
was
a
man
from
the
great
kanawha
to
williamsport
other
day
a
storekeeper
a
big
fat
man
with
a
beard
like
abraham
in
the
bible
i
heard
him
to
the
colonel
the
union
men
in
northwestern
virginia
are
on
the
ohio
side
of
the
mountains
said
he
the
ohio
we
all
for
the
union
said
he
more
northern
blood
than
southern
in
that
section
anyway
said
he
all
this
side
of
the
alleghenies
is
different
and
as
for
the
valley
of
the
south
branch
the
valley
of
the
south
branch
is
a
hotbed
of
rebels
that
what
he
said
hotbed
of
rebels
for
the
mountain
folk
in
between
he
says
hunt
with
guns
and
the
men
in
the
valley
hunt
with
dogs
and
there
ai
any
love
lost
between
them
at
the
best
of
times
then
too
it
the
feud
that
settles
it
if
a
mountain
man
hereditary
enemy
names
his
baby
jefferson
davis
then
the
first
man
he
names
his
abraham
lincoln
and
shoots
at
the
other
man
from
behind
a
bush
and
so
it
goes
but
the
valley
of
the
south
branch
is
old
stock
he
says
a
hotbed
of
rebels
when
it
taken
by
and
large
that
is
true
said
the
horseman
with
coolness
but
there
are
exceptions
to
all
rules
and
there
are
some
union
men
along
the
south
branch
he
stroked
his
horse
neck
so
dandy
are
there
exceptions
to
all
rules
he
a
plumb
beauty
that
horse
remarked
the
i
ride
much
myself
but
if
i
had
a
horse
like
that
and
a
straight
road
and
weather
like
this
i
would
ask
any
odds
between
here
and
milikenville
illinois
i
guess
he
a
jim
dandy
to
travel
lieutenant
mcneill
said
the
virginian
it
is
lovely
weather
you
do
often
have
a
december
like
this
in
your
part
of
the
world
no
we
do
and
i
only
hope
will
last
i
hope
it
will
assented
mcneill
it
bad
marching
in
bad
weather
i
do
guess
said
the
that
we
do
much
marching
before
springtime
no
i
reckon
not
answered
the
man
from
the
south
branch
i
came
from
romney
yesterday
general
kelly
is
letting
the
men
build
cabins
there
that
does
look
like
moving
we
doing
the
same
here
said
the
and
they
say
that
the
army
just
as
cosy
at
frederick
as
a
bug
in
a
rug
yes
sir
in
the
air
that
we
give
the
rebels
rope
till
springtime
the
touched
the
northern
bank
here
were
a
little
rocky
shore
an
expanse
of
swampy
ground
a
towpath
a
canal
a
road
cut
between
two
hills
and
in
the
background
a
village
with
one
or
two
church
spires
the
two
hills
were
white
with
tents
and
upon
the
brow
cannon
were
planted
to
rake
the
river
here
and
there
between
the
river
and
the
hills
were
knots
of
blue
soldiers
a
freight
boat
loaded
with
hay
passed
down
the
canal
it
was
a
splendid
early
afternoon
cool
still
and
bright
the
tall
marylander
and
the
three
blue
soldiers
left
the
boat
the
man
from
romney
leading
his
horse
headquarters
he
demanded
i
go
report
and
then
get
something
to
eat
for
both
dandy
and
myself
we
got
to
make
frederick
city
the
large
wall
tents
over
there
on
the
hill
directed
the
it
a
long
way
to
frederick
but
lord
with
that
horse
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
then
spoke
up
in
a
courageous
fashion
i
hope
you
have
a
pleasant
ride
lieutenant
i
guess
i
was
a
little
good
manners
calls
for
just
at
first
you
see
there
been
so
much
talk
of
of
of
and
your
voice
is
southern
if
your
politics
ai
is
my
usual
way
lieutenant
mcneill
smiled
i
am
sure
of
that
sergeant
as
you
say
there
has
been
a
deal
of
masquerading
and
this
side
of
the
river
naturally
looks
askance
at
the
other
but
you
see
general
kelly
over
there
and
he
happens
just
now
to
want
to
communicate
with
general
banks
his
smile
grew
broader
it
perfectly
natural
but
it
right
hard
on
the
man
acting
courier
lord
knows
i
had
trouble
enough
running
ashby
gauntlet
without
being
fired
on
from
this
side
that
so
that
so
answered
the
sergeant
cordially
well
good
luck
to
you
getting
back
you
may
find
some
friends
here
we
a
company
or
two
of
virginians
from
the
ohio
general
kelly
messenger
proceeded
to
climb
the
hill
to
the
wall
tents
indicated
there
was
a
short
delay
then
he
found
himself
in
the
presence
of
the
colonel
commanding
at
williamsport
from
general
kelly
at
romney
how
did
you
get
here
i
left
romney
sir
yesterday
morning
and
i
came
by
bridle
paths
through
the
mountains
i
was
sent
because
i
have
hunted
over
every
mile
of
that
country
and
i
could
keep
out
of
ashby
way
i
struck
the
river
above
bath
and
i
worked
down
through
the
woods
to
the
ferry
i
have
a
letter
for
general
banks
drawing
out
a
wallet
he
opened
it
and
handed
to
the
other
the
missive
in
question
if
i
was
chased
i
was
to
destroy
it
before
capture
he
said
the
slip
with
it
is
a
line
general
kelly
gave
me
the
colonel
commanding
at
williamsport
glanced
at
the
latter
document
a
native
of
the
south
branch
valley
he
said
crisply
that
a
disaffected
region
yes
sir
it
is
but
there
are
one
or
two
loyal
families
you
wish
to
go
on
to
frederick
this
afternoon
yes
sir
as
soon
as
my
horse
is
a
little
rested
my
orders
are
to
use
all
dispatch
back
to
romney
with
general
banks
answer
the
colonel
seated
at
a
table
weighed
general
kelly
letter
in
his
hand
looked
at
the
superscription
turned
it
over
and
studied
the
seal
do
the
rebels
on
the
other
side
show
any
signs
of
coming
activity
our
secret
service
men
have
not
been
very
successful
they
make
statements
that
it
is
hard
to
credit
i
should
be
glad
of
any
reliable
information
what
did
you
see
or
hear
coming
through
the
lieutenant
studied
the
floor
a
moment
shrugged
and
spoke
out
ashby
active
enough
sir
since
yesterday
i
have
just
grazed
three
picket
posts
he
has
vedettes
everywhere
the
report
is
that
he
has
fifteen
hundred
troopers
nearly
all
valley
men
born
to
the
saddle
and
knowing
every
crook
and
cranny
of
the
land
they
move
like
a
whirlwind
and
deal
in
surprises
the
assyrian
came
down
like
the
wolf
on
the
fold
only
these
cohorts
are
grey
not
purple
and
gold
that
ashby
on
the
other
hand
jackson
at
winchester
need
not
perhaps
be
taken
into
account
the
general
impression
is
that
he
stay
where
he
is
until
spring
i
managed
to
extract
some
information
from
a
mountain
man
above
sleepy
creek
jackson
is
drilling
his
men
from
daylight
until
dark
it
is
said
that
he
is
crazy
on
the
subject
on
most
subjects
in
fact
that
he
thinks
himself
a
cromwell
and
is
bent
upon
turning
his
troops
into
ironsides
of
course
should
general
banks
make
any
movement
to
cross
preparatory
say
to
joining
with
general
kelly
jackson
might
swing
out
of
winchester
and
give
him
check
otherwise
he
probably
keep
on
drilling
the
winter
too
far
advanced
said
the
colonel
for
any
such
movement
upon
our
part
as
soon
as
it
is
spring
we
go
over
there
and
trample
out
this
rebellion
he
weighed
kelly
letter
once
more
in
his
hand
then
restored
it
to
the
bearer
it
all
right
lieutenant
mcneill
i
pass
you
you
read
byron
yes
said
lieutenant
mcneill
briefly
he
a
great
poet
juan
now
and
suvaroff
at
ismail
he
made
no
answer
but
he
took
the
city
the
bivouac
too
in
mazeppa
he
restored
general
kelly
letter
and
the
accompanying
slip
to
his
wallet
thank
you
sir
if
i
am
to
make
frederick
before
bedtime
i
had
better
be
going
an
aide
of
general
banks
remarked
the
colonel
is
here
and
is
returning
to
frederick
this
afternoon
he
is
an
englishman
i
believe
of
birth
you
might
ride
together
very
opportunely
here
he
is
a
tall
blond
being
for
the
road
had
loomed
in
dark
blue
before
the
tent
door
captain
marchmont
said
the
colonel
let
me
make
you
acquainted
with
lieutenant
mcneill
a
virginian
bearing
a
letter
from
general
kelly
to
general
banks
a
gentleman
with
a
taste
too
for
your
great
poet
byron
as
you
are
both
riding
to
frederick
you
may
find
it
pleasant
to
ride
in
company
i
must
ride
rapidly
said
mcneill
but
if
captain
marchmont
i
always
ride
rapidly
answered
the
captain
learned
it
in
texas
in
at
your
service
lieutenant
whenever
you
ready
the
road
to
frederick
lay
clear
over
hill
and
dale
past
forest
and
stream
through
a
gap
in
the
mountain
by
mill
and
barn
and
farmhouse
straight
through
a
number
of
miles
of
crystal
afternoon
out
of
williamsport
conversation
began
when
you
want
a
purchaser
for
that
horse
i
your
man
said
the
aide
by
any
chance
you
want
to
sell
mcneill
laughed
not
captain
he
stroked
the
brown
shoulder
not
dun
dandy
what
his
name
dundandy
no
replied
the
lieutenant
just
dandy
i
rather
fond
of
him
i
think
we
see
it
out
together
yes
they
are
bad
comrades
said
the
other
amicably
in
when
i
was
with
lopez
in
cuba
i
had
a
little
black
mare
that
was
just
as
well
worth
dying
for
as
a
woman
or
a
man
or
most
causes
but
damn
me
she
died
for
me
carried
me
past
a
murderous
ambuscade
got
a
bullet
for
her
pains
and
never
dropped
until
she
reached
our
camp
he
coughed
what
pleasant
weather
was
it
difficult
getting
through
lines
yes
rather
they
rode
for
a
time
in
silence
between
fields
of
dead
aster
and
goldenrod
when
i
was
in
italy
with
garibaldi
said
captain
marchmont
thoughtfully
i
saw
something
of
kinsmen
divided
in
war
it
looked
a
very
unnatural
thing
you
a
virginian
now
yes
i
am
a
virginian
and
you
are
fighting
against
virginia
curious
the
other
smiled
to
be
where
you
are
you
must
believe
in
the
inviolability
of
the
union
oh
i
answered
marchmont
coolly
i
believe
in
it
of
course
i
am
fighting
for
it
it
chanced
you
see
that
i
was
in
france
and
out
of
service
and
damnably
out
at
elbows
too
when
europe
heard
of
bull
run
i
took
passage
at
once
in
a
merchant
ship
from
havre
it
was
my
understanding
that
she
was
bound
for
new
orleans
but
instead
she
put
into
boston
harbour
i
had
no
marked
preference
fighting
being
fighting
under
whatever
banner
it
occurs
so
the
next
day
i
offered
my
sword
to
the
governor
of
massachusetts
north
and
south
they
none
of
mine
but
were
i
in
england
where
i
have
been
of
late
years
and
a
row
turned
up
i
should
fight
with
england
no
doubt
answered
the
other
your
mind
travels
along
the
broad
and
simple
lines
of
the
matter
but
with
us
there
are
many
subtle
and
intricate
considerations
passing
now
through
woods
they
started
a
covey
of
partridges
the
small
brown
and
white
shapes
vanished
in
a
skurry
of
dead
leaves
no
doubt
no
doubt
said
the
soldier
of
fortune
at
any
rate
i
have
rubbed
off
particularity
in
such
matters
live
and
let
live
and
each
man
to
run
the
great
race
according
to
his
inner
vision
if
he
really
conflicts
with
me
i
let
him
know
it
they
rode
on
now
talking
now
silent
to
either
side
beyond
stone
walls
the
fields
ran
bare
and
brown
to
distant
woods
the
shadow
of
the
wayside
trees
grew
longer
and
the
air
more
deep
and
cold
they
passed
a
string
of
wagons
bearing
forage
for
the
army
the
sun
touched
the
western
hills
rimming
them
as
with
a
forest
fire
the
horsemen
entered
a
defile
between
the
hills
travelled
through
twilight
for
a
while
then
emerged
upon
a
world
still
softly
lighted
in
the
country
at
home
said
the
englishman
the
waits
are
practicing
christmas
carols
i
wish
answered
the
virginian
that
we
had
kept
that
old
custom
i
should
like
once
to
hear
english
carols
sung
beneath
the
windows
on
a
snowy
night
as
he
rode
he
began
to
sing
aloud
in
a
voice
not
remarkable
but
good
enough
to
give
pleasure
as
joseph
was
he
heard
an
angel
sing
night
shall
be
born
our
heavenly
king
yes
i
remember
that
one
quite
well
said
captain
marchmont
and
proceeded
to
sing
in
an
excellent
bass
he
neither
shall
be
born
in
housen
nor
in
hall
nor
in
the
place
of
paradise
but
in
an
ox
stall
do
you
know
the
next
verse
yes
said
mcneill
he
neither
shall
be
clothed
in
purple
nor
in
pall
but
all
in
fair
linen
as
are
babies
all
that
it
nodded
the
other
and
the
next
goes
he
neither
shall
be
rocked
in
silver
nor
in
gold
but
in
a
wooden
cradle
that
rocks
on
the
mould
alternately
they
sang
the
carol
through
the
sun
went
down
but
the
pink
stayed
in
the
sky
and
was
mirrored
in
a
tranquil
stream
which
they
crossed
it
faded
at
last
into
the
quiet
dusk
a
cricket
chirped
from
a
field
of
dried
michaelmas
daisies
they
overtook
and
passed
an
infantry
regiment
coming
up
an
officer
told
them
from
harper
ferry
the
night
fell
cold
and
still
with
many
stars
we
are
not
far
from
frederick
said
marchmont
you
were
never
here
before
no
i
take
you
at
once
to
general
banks
you
go
back
to
kelly
at
romney
just
as
soon
as
general
banks
shall
have
answered
general
letter
you
have
an
occasional
fight
over
there
yes
up
and
down
the
line
ashby
command
is
rather
active
by
george
i
wish
i
were
returning
with
you
when
you
reported
look
after
you
if
you
allow
me
pleasant
enough
major
hertz
whom
i
knew
in
prussia
captain
wingate
of
your
old
army
and
one
or
two
others
i
exceedingly
obliged
said
mcneill
but
i
have
ridden
hard
of
late
and
slept
little
and
i
should
prove
dull
company
moreover
there
a
good
priest
in
frederick
who
is
a
friend
of
a
friend
of
mine
i
have
a
message
for
him
and
if
general
banks
permits
i
shall
sleep
soundly
and
quietly
at
his
house
very
good
said
marchmont
you
get
a
better
night
there
though
i
sorry
not
to
have
you
with
there
are
the
lights
of
frederick
and
here
the
picket
you
have
your
pass
from
williamsport
mcneill
gave
it
to
a
blue
soldier
who
called
a
corporal
who
read
it
by
a
swinging
lantern
very
good
pass
lieutenant
mcneill
the
two
rode
on
to
left
and
right
were
lighted
streets
of
tents
varied
here
and
there
by
substantial
cabins
commissary
quarters
appeared
sutlers
shops
booths
places
of
entertainment
guardhouses
a
chapel
soldiers
were
everywhere
dimly
seen
within
the
tents
where
the
door
flap
was
fastened
back
plain
to
view
about
the
in
open
places
clustering
like
bees
in
the
small
squares
from
which
ran
the
camp
streets
thronging
the
trodden
places
before
the
sutlers
everywhere
apparent
in
the
foreground
and
divined
in
the
distance
from
somewhere
came
the
strains
of
yankee
doodle
a
gust
of
wind
blew
out
the
folds
of
the
stars
and
stripes
fastened
above
some
regimental
headquarters
the
city
of
tents
and
of
frame
structures
hasty
and
crude
of
fires
in
open
places
of
sutlers
shops
and
cantines
and
booths
of
strolling
players
of
chapels
and
hospitals
of
fluttering
flags
and
wandering
music
of
restless
blue
soldiers
oscillating
like
motes
in
some
searchlight
of
the
giants
persisted
for
a
long
distance
at
last
it
died
away
there
came
a
quiet
field
or
two
then
the
old
maryland
town
of
frederick
chapter
xi
as
joseph
was
at
eleven
that
night
by
the
frederick
clocks
an
orderly
found
an
englishman
a
prussian
a
new
yorker
and
a
man
from
somewhere
west
of
the
mississippi
playing
poker
general
banks
would
like
to
speak
to
captain
marchmont
for
a
moment
sir
the
aide
laid
down
his
cards
and
adjusted
his
plumage
before
a
long
mirror
lieber
gott
said
major
hertz
i
wish
our
general
would
go
sleep
and
leafe
us
play
the
game
captain
marchmont
proceeding
to
a
handsomely
furnished
apartment
knocked
entered
saluted
and
was
greeted
by
a
general
in
a
disturbed
frame
of
mind
look
here
captain
you
rode
from
williamsport
with
that
fellow
of
kelly
did
you
notice
anything
out
of
the
usual
the
aide
deliberated
he
had
a
splendid
horse
sir
and
the
man
himself
seemed
rather
a
mettled
personage
if
that
out
of
the
usual
i
noticed
that
oh
of
course
he
all
right
said
the
general
kelly
letter
is
perfectly
and
so
i
make
no
doubt
are
mcneill
passport
and
paper
of
instructions
i
gave
the
letter
back
or
i
show
you
the
signatures
it
only
that
i
got
to
thinking
awhile
ago
after
gone
he
took
a
turn
across
the
roses
upon
the
carpet
a
man
been
in
politics
knows
there
are
so
many
dodges
our
spies
say
that
general
jackson
is
very
acute
i
got
to
thinking
he
came
back
to
the
table
did
you
talk
of
the
military
situation
coming
along
very
little
sir
he
was
inquisitive
did
criticise
or
draw
you
on
to
talk
ask
about
my
troops
and
my
movements
he
did
not
sir
the
general
sighed
it
all
right
of
course
you
see
he
seemed
an
intelligent
man
and
we
got
to
talking
i
wrote
my
answer
to
general
kelly
he
has
it
now
is
to
start
to
romney
with
it
at
dawn
then
i
asked
some
questions
and
we
got
to
talking
it
all
straight
of
course
but
on
looking
back
i
find
that
i
said
some
things
he
seemed
an
intelligent
man
and
in
his
general
confidence
well
i
dismissed
him
at
last
and
he
saluted
and
went
off
to
get
some
rest
before
starting
and
then
somehow
i
got
to
thinking
i
have
never
been
south
and
all
these
places
are
only
names
to
me
but
he
unrolled
upon
the
table
a
map
of
large
dimensions
look
here
a
moment
captain
this
is
a
map
the
department
furnishes
us
it
black
you
see
for
the
utterly
disloyal
sections
shaded
for
the
doubtful
and
white
where
there
are
unionists
all
virginia
black
except
this
northwest
section
and
that
largely
shaded
what
asked
marchmont
is
this
long
black
patch
in
the
midst
of
the
shading
that
the
valley
of
the
south
branch
of
the
potomac
see
it
marked
now
this
man
from
that
locality
h
m
dark
as
erebus
apparently
along
the
south
branch
just
so
general
banks
paced
again
the
roses
pshaw
it
all
right
i
never
saw
a
straighter
looking
fellow
i
just
thought
i
would
ask
you
the
nature
of
his
talk
along
the
road
it
was
hardly
of
military
matters
sir
but
if
you
wish
to
detain
him
general
kelly
must
have
my
letter
i
not
to
move
and
it
important
that
he
should
know
it
why
not
question
him
again
the
general
came
back
to
the
big
chair
beside
the
table
i
have
no
doubt
he
as
honest
as
i
am
he
looked
at
the
clock
after
midnight
and
i
been
reviewing
troops
all
day
do
you
think
worth
while
captain
in
war
very
little
things
are
worth
while
sir
but
you
were
with
him
all
afternoon
and
he
seemed
perfectly
all
right
yes
sir
i
liked
him
very
well
he
pulled
at
his
long
yellow
moustache
there
was
only
one
little
circumstance
if
you
are
doubtful
sir
the
papers
of
course
might
be
forged
the
late
governor
of
massachusetts
rested
irresolute
except
that
he
was
born
in
virginia
there
is
a
reason
for
suspecting
him
and
our
policy
to
conciliate
all
this
shaded
corner
up
here
the
clock
struck
the
general
banks
looked
longingly
toward
his
bedroom
i
been
through
the
mill
it
pretty
hard
on
a
man
this
working
over
where
he
lodging
mcneill
sir
he
said
he
would
find
quarters
with
some
connection
or
other
a
catholic
priest
a
catholic
there
again
the
general
looked
perturbed
rising
he
took
from
a
desk
two
or
three
pages
of
blue
official
paper
covered
with
writing
i
got
that
from
washington
from
the
secret
service
department
read
it
captain
marchmont
read
without
exception
the
catholic
priests
in
frederick
city
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
the
catholics
throughout
maryland
are
secessionists
distrust
all
maryland
in
fact
the
jesuits
have
a
house
at
frederick
city
they
are
suspected
of
furnishing
information
keep
them
under
such
surveillance
as
your
judgment
shall
humph
general
banks
sighed
poured
out
something
from
a
decanter
and
drank
it
i
guess
captain
you
had
better
go
and
bring
that
man
from
the
south
branch
back
here
take
a
few
men
and
do
it
quietly
he
seems
a
gentleman
and
there
may
be
absolutely
nothing
wrong
tell
him
something
to
add
to
general
kelly
letter
here
a
list
of
the
priests
in
frederick
father
tierney
seems
the
most
looked
up
to
and
i
gave
him
a
subscription
yesterday
for
his
orphan
asylum
half
an
hour
later
marchmont
and
two
men
found
themselves
before
a
small
square
stone
house
standing
apart
from
its
neighbours
in
a
small
square
yard
from
without
the
moonbeams
flooded
it
from
within
came
no
pinpoint
of
light
it
was
past
the
middle
of
the
night
and
almost
all
the
town
lay
still
and
dark
marchmont
lifted
the
brass
knocker
and
let
it
fall
the
sound
deep
and
reverberant
should
have
reached
every
ear
within
however
inattentive
he
waited
but
there
came
no
answering
footfall
he
knocked
again
no
light
nor
sound
again
only
interstellar
quiet
he
shook
the
door
go
around
to
the
back
roberts
and
see
if
you
can
get
in
roberts
departed
marchmont
picked
up
some
pieces
of
gravel
from
the
path
and
threw
them
against
the
window
panes
to
no
effect
roberts
came
back
that
an
awful
heavy
door
sir
heavier
than
this
and
the
windows
are
high
up
very
good
said
the
captain
this
one
looks
stronger
than
it
really
is
stand
back
you
two
he
put
his
shoulder
to
the
door
wait
a
minute
sir
somebody
lit
a
candle
upstairs
the
candle
passed
leisurely
from
window
to
window
was
lost
for
a
minute
and
then
through
a
small
above
the
door
was
observed
descending
the
stairs
a
bolt
creaked
then
another
the
door
opened
and
father
tierney
hastily
gowned
and
blinking
stood
before
the
invaders
he
shaded
his
candle
with
his
hand
and
the
light
struck
back
showing
a
strong
and
rosy
and
likable
face
faith
he
said
an
i
thought
i
was
after
hearin
a
noise
gentlemen
or
rather
for
it
must
be
toward
cockcrow
what
it
not
so
late
as
that
interrupted
marchmont
i
wish
i
had
your
recipe
for
sleeping
father
it
would
be
invaluable
when
a
man
want
to
be
waked
up
however
my
business
is
not
with
you
but
holy
powers
said
father
tierney
did
ye
not
know
that
i
live
here
by
myself
father
lavalle
is
at
the
other
end
of
town
and
father
lives
by
the
noviciate
sure
and
any
one
could
have
told
you
father
lavalle
and
father
said
the
aide
are
nothing
to
the
question
you
have
a
guest
with
you
father
tierney
looked
enlightened
oh
av
coorse
there
always
business
on
hand
between
soldiers
was
it
lieutenant
mcneill
you
be
looking
after
marchmont
nodded
there
are
some
instructions
that
general
banks
neglected
to
give
him
it
is
late
but
the
general
wishes
to
get
it
all
straight
before
he
sleeps
i
am
sorry
to
disturb
lieutenant
mcneill
for
he
must
be
fatigued
but
orders
are
orders
you
know
av
coorse
av
coorse
agreed
father
tierney
man
having
authority
say
unto
this
man
go
and
he
goeth
and
to
another
come
and
he
cometh
so
father
if
you
be
good
enough
to
explain
to
lieutenant
mcneill
or
if
you
tell
me
which
is
his
room
the
light
of
the
candle
showed
a
faint
trouble
in
father
tierney
face
sure
it
too
bad
do
you
think
my
son
the
matter
is
of
importance
would
be
after
being
just
a
little
of
directions
perhaps
said
marchmont
but
orders
are
orders
father
and
i
must
awaken
lieutenant
mcneill
indeed
it
hard
to
think
that
asleep
he
is
aslape
then
will
you
be
so
good
as
to
tell
him
indeed
and
i
wish
i
could
do
that
same
thing
my
son
but
it
is
in
nature
general
banks
aide
made
a
gesture
of
impatience
i
ca
dawdle
here
any
longer
either
you
or
i
father
he
pushed
into
the
hall
where
is
his
room
holy
virgin
exclaimed
father
tierney
it
vexed
he
be
when
he
learns
that
the
general
was
done
with
him
there
the
room
captain
darlint
but
marchmont
eyes
followed
the
pointing
of
the
candlestick
there
he
exclaimed
the
door
was
immediately
upon
the
left
not
five
feet
from
the
portal
he
had
lately
belaboured
then
was
against
his
window
that
i
flung
the
gravel
with
an
oath
he
crossed
the
hall
and
struck
his
hand
against
the
panel
indicated
no
answer
he
knocked
again
with
peremptoriness
then
tried
the
door
it
was
unlocked
and
opened
quietly
to
his
touch
all
beyond
was
silent
and
dark
father
tierney
i
thank
you
for
that
candle
the
priest
gave
it
and
the
aide
held
it
up
displaying
a
chill
and
vacant
chamber
furnished
with
monastic
spareness
there
was
a
narrow
couch
that
had
been
slept
in
marchmont
crossed
the
bare
floor
bent
and
felt
the
bedclothing
quite
cold
you
been
gone
some
time
my
friend
h
m
things
look
rather
black
for
you
father
tierney
spoke
from
the
middle
of
the
room
it
sorry
the
lieutenant
will
be
sure
and
he
thought
he
had
the
general
last
word
until
you
wake
my
son
says
i
will
give
us
breakfast
at
eight
no
father
says
he
kelly
is
wearying
for
this
letter
from
general
banks
if
i
get
it
through
prompt
it
will
be
remembered
for
me
he
says
will
be
a
point
toward
promotion
he
says
horse
has
had
a
couple
of
hours
rest
and
he
a
trojan
beside
he
says
sleep
an
hour
myself
and
then
i
be
taking
the
road
back
to
romney
ashby
over
on
the
other
side
he
says
the
sooner
i
get
ashby
off
my
mind
the
better
pleased
i
be
he
says
and
thereupon
he
slept
for
an
hour
marchmont
still
regarded
the
bed
i
be
damned
if
i
know
my
friend
whether
you
blue
or
grey
how
long
has
he
been
gone
father
tierney
pondered
the
question
by
the
seven
holy
candles
my
son
i
was
that
deep
asleep
when
you
knocked
that
i
do
rightly
know
the
time
of
night
maybe
he
has
been
gone
an
hour
maybe
more
and
how
did
he
know
the
countersign
faith
and
i
understood
that
the
general
himself
gave
him
the
word
h
m
said
marchmont
and
tugged
at
his
moustache
he
stood
in
silence
for
a
moment

sharply
blue
or
grey

damned

and
presint
my
respects
to
the
general
sure
was
a
fine
donation
for
the
orphans
he
donated
it
was
two
of
a
moonlight
night
when
captain
marchmont
and
his
troopers
took
the
road
to
williamsport
they
passed
through
the
silent
camp
gave
the
word
to
the
last
sentry
and
emerged
upon
the
quiet
countryside
was
a
courier
before
them
yes
sir
a
man
on
a
great
bay
horse
said
he
had
important
dispatches
the
road
hard
beneath
the
hoofs
of
the
horses
stretched
south
and
west
unmarked
by
any
moving
creature
marchmont
rode
in
advance
his
horse
was
strong
and
fresh
clear
of
the
pickets
he
put
him
to
the
gallop
an
hour
went
by
nothing
but
the
cold
still
moonshine
the
sound
of
hoofs
upon
the
metalled
road
and
now
and
then
in
some
wayside
house
the
stealthy
lifting
of
a
sash
as
man
or
woman
looked
forth
upon
the
riders
at
a
tollgate
the
aide
drew
rein
leaned
from
his
saddle
and
struck
against
the
door
with
a
pistol
butt
a
man
opened
a
window
has
a
courier
passed
going
to
williamsport
yes
sir
a
man
on
a
great
bay
horse
three
quarters
of
an
hour
ago
was
he
riding
fast
yes
riding
fast
marchmont
galloped
on
his
two
troopers
behind
him
their
steeds
were
good
but
not
so
good
as
was
his
he
left
them
some
way
behind
the
night
grew
old
the
moon
which
had
risen
late
was
high
in
the
heavens
the
englishman
traversed
a
shadowy
wood
then
went
by
silvered
fields
a
cabin
door
creaked
an
old
negro
put
out
a
cautious
head
has
a
courier
passed
going
to
williamsport
yaas
sah
er
big
man
on
er
big
bay
half
er
hour
ergo
sah
marchmont
galloped
on
he
looked
back
over
his
shoulder
his
men
were
a
mile
in
the
rear
and
when
i
come
up
with
you
my
friend
what
then
on
the
whole
i
do
think
i
ask
you
to
turn
with
me
we
go
on
to
williamsport
and
there
we
hold
the
court
of
inquiry
he
touched
his
horse
with
the
spur
the
miles
of
road
ran
past
the
air
eager
and
cold
pressed
sharply
there
came
a
feeling
of
the
morning
he
was
now
upon
a
level
stretch
of
road
before
him
a
mile
away
a
long
bare
hill
he
crossed
a
bridge
hollowly
sounding
through
the
night
and
neared
the
hill
his
vision
was
a
trained
one
exercised
by
war
in
many
lands
there
was
a
dark
object
on
the
road
before
him
it
grew
in
size
but
it
grew
very
slowly
it
too
was
moving
you
a
tired
horse
though
lieutenant
said
the
aide
strain
as
you
may
i
catch
you
up
his
own
horse
devoured
the
ground
steadily
galloping
by
the
frosty
fields
through
the
air
of
earliest
dawn
suddenly
before
him
the
courier
from
kelly
halted
mounted
against
a
faint
light
in
the
southwestern
sky
he
stood
upon
the
hilltop
and
waited
for
the
horseman
from
frederick
the
latter
took
at
a
gallop
the
remainder
of
the
level
road
but
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
changed
to
a
trot
above
him
the
waiting
horseman
grew
he
waited
very
quietly
marchmont
observed
sitting
turned
in
his
saddle
against
the
sky
of
dawn
damned
if
i
know
if
you
truly
blue
or
grey
thought
the
aide
did
you
stop
to
disarm
suspicion
because
you
saw
you
be
overtaken
another
minute
and
the
two
were
in
speaking
distance
another
and
they
were
together
on
the
hilltop
said
mcneill
what
haste
to
williamsport
he
bent
forward
in
the
light
that
was
just
strong
enough
to
see
by
why
it
is
yesterday
comrade
captain
marchmont
we
must
have
started
said
marchmont
somewhere
near
the
same
hour
i
have
a
communication
from
general
banks
for
the
commander
at
williamsport
if
the
other
raised
his
brows
over
the
aide
acting
courier
twice
in
hours
the
action
did
not
appear
in
the
yet
uncertain
light
apparently
mcneill
took
the
statement
easily
upon
its
face
value
in
that
case
he
said
with
amicableness
i
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
your
company
a
little
longer
we
must
be
about
six
miles
out
i
should
think
about
that
distance
agreed
the
other
and
as
at
this
unearthly
hour
i
certainly
can
not
see
the
colonel
and
as
your
horse
is
evidently
spent
why
go
the
rest
of
the
way
at
a
gallop
it
was
my
idea
said
mcneill
to
pass
the
river
early
if
i
can
gain
the
big
woods
before
the
day
is
old
so
much
the
better
dandy
is
tired
it
is
true
but
he
has
a
certain
staying
quality
however
we
will
go
more
slowly
now
they
put
themselves
in
motion
two
men
are
behind
us
remarked
the
man
from
romney
yes
there
they
come
through
the
fields
two
troopers
who
are
riding
with
me
regulars
they
accommodate
their
pace
to
ours
very
good
said
the
other
with
serenity
and
the
two
rode
on
marchmont
men
a
little
way
behind
by
now
the
stars
had
faded
the
moon
looked
wan
there
was
a
faint
rose
in
the
east
far
in
a
vale
to
the
left
a
cock
crew
and
was
answered
from
across
a
stream
to
the
south
visible
between
and
above
the
fringing
trees
a
ribbon
of
mist
proclaimed
the
river
the
two
men
rode
not
in
silence
but
still
not
with
yesterday
freedom
of
speech
there
was
however
no
quietude
that
the
chill
ebb
of
the
hour
and
the
weariness
of
overwork
might
not
account
for
they
spoke
of
this
and
that
briefly
but
amicably
will
you
report
at
headquarters
asked
marchmont
before
attempting
the
virginia
shore
i
do
not
yet
know
there
is
no
occasion
as
i
have
all
instructions
from
general
banks
i
wish
to
make
no
unnecessary
delay
have
you
the
countersign
yes
will
you
cross
by
the
ferry
i
hardly
think
so
ashby
may
be
watching
that
and
the
ford
below
there
is
a
place
farther
up
the
river
that
i
may
try
that
is
after
you
pass
through
williamsport
yes
a
mile
or
two
beyond
the
light
increased
gold
clouds
barred
the
east
the
cocks
crew
and
crows
came
cawing
from
the
woods
to
the
vast
brown
cornfields
the
road
now
ran
at
no
great
distance
from
the
canal
and
the
river
first
came
the
canal
mirroring
between
trodden
banks
the
red
east
then
the
towpath
a
cornfield
a
fringe
of
sycamore
oak
and
willow
then
the
potomac
veiled
with
mist
they
were
drawing
near
to
williamsport
the
day
travel
had
begun
they
met
or
overtook
workers
upon
the
road
sutlers
carts
ordnance
wagons
a
squad
of
artillerymen
conducting
a
gun
a
country
doctor
in
an
old
buggy
two
boys
driving
calves
yoked
together
the
road
made
a
curve
to
the
north
like
a
sickle
on
the
inland
side
it
ran
beneath
a
bluff
on
the
other
a
rail
fence
rimmed
a
embankment
dropping
to
a
streamlet
and
a
wide
field
where
the
corn
stood
in
shocks
here
at
a
debouching
from
the
north
into
the
pike
they
encountered
a
company
of
infantry
marchmont
checked
his
horse
i
not
sure
but
i
think
i
know
the
officer
be
so
good
as
to
await
me
a
moment
lieutenant
he
rode
up
to
the
captain
in
blue
and
the
two
talked
in
low
voices
the
infantrymen
broke
lines
a
little
leaned
on
their
rifles
and
discussed
arrangements
for
breakfast
among
them
were
a
number
of
tall
men
lean
and
sinewy
with
a
sweep
of
line
and
unconstraint
of
gesture
that
smacked
of
hunters
ways
and
mountain
exercise
the
two
troopers
from
frederick
city
came
up
the
place
of
the
showed
animated
and
blue
the
sun
pushed
its
golden
ball
above
the
hilltops
and
all
the
rifle
barrels
gleamed
in
the
light
marchmont
and
the
captain
approached
the
courier
from
kelly
sitting
his
horse
in
the
middle
of
the
road
lieutenant
mcneill
said
the
aide
with
quietness
there
seemed
at
frederick
some
irregularity
in
your
papers
doubtless
everything
can
be
explained
and
your
delay
in
reaching
romney
will
be
slight
it
is
my
duty
to
conduct
you
to
williamsport
headquarters
and
to
report
the
matter
to
the
colonel
commanding
i
regret
the
interruption
not
a
long
continued
one
i
trust
to
our
pleasant
relations
mcneill
had
made
a
movement
of
surprise
and
his
brows
had
come
together
it
was
but
for
an
instant
then
he
smiled
and
smiled
with
his
eyes
if
such
are
your
orders
sir
neither
you
nor
i
can
help
the
matter
to
headquarters
of
course
the
sooner
the
better
i
can
have
no
possible
objection
he
touched
his
horse
and
advanced
a
little
farther
into
the
road
all
the
blue
soldiers
were
about
him
a
brought
for
the
moment
opposite
him
uttered
an
exclamation
you
know
this
officer
miller
called
the
captain
of
infantry
miller
saluted
no
sir
but
i
was
in
the
when
he

i

the
captain
that

them
here
he
raised
his
voice
men
from
northwest
virginia
advance
a
detachment
swung
forward
lean
men
and
tall
stamped
as
hunters
frontiersmen
projected
to
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
do
any
of
you
men

the
south
branch
of
the
potomac
three
voices
made
themselves

like
i

said
a
fourth
voice
the
mcneills
the
courier
from
kelly
glanced
at
him
sharply
and
what
have
you
got
my
man
against
the
mcneills
i
got
something
stated
the
mountaineer
doggedly
something
ever
since
afore

mexican

something
against
them
when
i
heard
over
there
in

other
side
root
and

and
root
and
branch
they
damned
rebels

know
demanded
the
captain
this
one
this
is
lieutenant
mcneill
the
man
looked
general
kelly
courier
facing
him
squarely
there
was
a
silence
upon
the
road
to
williamsport
the
mountaineer
spat
he
may
be
a
lieutenant
but
he
ai
a
mcneill
not
from
the
south
branch
valley
he
ai
he
says
he
is
do
you
think
my
friend
asked
the
man
in
question
and
he
looked
amused
that
you
really
know
all
the
mcneills
or
their
party
the
valley
of
the
south
branch
is
long
and
wide
and
the
families
are
large
one
mcneill
has
simply
escaped
your
observation
there
ai
said
the
man
with
grimness
a
damned
one
of
them
that
has
escaped
my
observation
and
there
ai
one
of
them
that
ai
a
damned
rebel

and
those
of
them
that
ai
with
ashby

with
jackson
and
you
may
be
abraham
lincoln
or
general
banks
but
you
ai
a
mcneill
the
ranks
opened
and
there
emerged
a
stout
german
musician
herr
captain
i
was
in
winchester
before
i
ran
away
and
joined
der
union
herr
captain
i

richard
cleave
dot

dundee
exclaimed
marchmont
that
the
circumstance
you
started
to
say
he
gave
an
abrupt
laugh
on
the
whole
i
like
you
even
better
than
i
did
but
it
a
question
now
for
a
drumhead
and
a
provost
guard
sorry
the
other
hand
had
been
resting
upon
his
horse
neck
suddenly
there
was
a
motion
of
his
knee
a
pressure
of
this
hand
a
curious
sound
half
speech
half
cry
addressed
to
the
bay
beneath
him
dundee
backed
gathered
himself
together
arose
in
air
cleared
the
rail
fence
overpassed
the
embankment
and
the
rivulet
beneath
touched
the
frosted
earth
of
the
cornfield
and
was
away
like
an
arrow
toward
the
misty
white
river
out
of
the
tumult
upon
the
road
rang
a
shot
marchmont
the
smoking
pistol
still
in
hand
urged
his
horse
to
the
leap
touched
in
turn
the
field
below
and
at
top
speed
followed
the
bay
he
shouted
to
the
troopers
behind
him
their
horses
made
some
difficulty
but
in
another
moment
they
too
were
in
pursuit
rifles
flashed
from
the
road
but
the
bay
had
reached
a
copse
that
gave
a
moment
shelter
horse
and
rider
emerged
unhurt
from
the
friendly
walls
of
cedar
and
locust
forward
sharpshooters
cried
the
infantry
captain
a
lieutenant
and
half
a
dozen
men
made
all
haste
across
the
fence
down
the
low
bluff
and
over
the
field
as
they
ran
one
fired
then
another
but
the
fleeing
horse
kept
on
the
rider
close
to
the
neck
in
their
sight
beyond
the
water
the
virginia
shore
the
bay
moved
as
though
he
knew
not
fatigue
but
only
a
friend
dire
need
the
stock
told
many
a
race
had
been
won
by
his
forefathers
what
his
rider
hand
and
voice
conveyed
can
not
be
precisely
known
but
that
which
was
effected
was
an
access
of
love
courage
and
understanding
of
the
end
desired
he
moved
with
every
power
drawn
to
the
point
in
hand
marchmont
only
a
few
lengths
behind
fired
again
the
ball
went
through
cleave
sleeve
grazing
his
arm
and
dundee
shoulder
the
two
shot
on
marchmont
behind
then
the
two
mounted
men
then
the
sharpshooters
running
afoot
from
the
road
the
remainder
of
the
company
watched
with
immemorial
interest
the
immemorial
incident
he
wounded
the
bay
wounded
too
get
him
at
the
canal
thar
a
bridge
around
the
bend
but
he
know
it
climb
atop
the
fence
ye
can
see
better
the
canal
deep
between
willowy
banks
a
moat
to
be
overpassed
without
drawbridge
lay
ahead
of
the
foremost
horse
and
rider
a
moment
and
the
two
burst
through
the
screen
of
willows
another
and
from
the
high
bare
bank
they
had
leaped
into
the
narrow
deep
and
sluggish
stream
that
horse
wounded
he
sinking
no
by
god
he
ai
whar
the
captain
from
frederick
thar
he
is

into
the
belt

the

the
bank
before
him
up
to
the
towpath
was
of
loose
earth
and
stone
steep
and
difficult
he
climbed
it
like
a
as
he
reached
the
towpath
marchmont
appeared
before
the
willows
his
horse
a
powerful
sorrel
took
the
water
unhesitatingly
but
the
opposite
bank
made
trouble
it
was
but
a
short
delay
while
the
soldiers
on
the
road
held
their
breath
he
was
up
and
away
across
the
wide
field
between
canal
and
river
the
troopers
too
had
thundered
across
the
bridge
the
sharpshooters
were
behind
them
blue
moving
points
between
the
shocked
corn
the
field
was
wide
rough
and
furrowed
bordered
on
its
southern
side
by
a
line
of
sycamores
leafless
and
tall
a
lacework
of
white
branches
against
the
now
brilliant
sky
beyond
the
sycamores
lay
the
wide
river
beyond
the
river
lay
virginia

red
of
eye
and
nostril
foam
streaked
and
quivering
raced
on
his
rider
talking
to
him
as
to
a
lover
but
the
bay
was
sore
tired
and
the
sorrel
gained
marchmont
sent
his
voice
before
him

hard
answered
cleave
between
his
teeth
he
caressed
his
horse
he
made
their
two
hearts
one
he
talked
to
him
he
crooned
an
air
the
stallion
knew
then
fling
ope
your
gates
and
let
me
go
free
for
it
up
with
the
bonnets
of
bonnie
dundee
superbly
the
bay
answered
but
the
sorrel
too
was
a
thoroughbred
fresh
when
he
left
frederick
stride
by
stride
he
gained
cleave
crashed
into
the
belt
of
sycamores
before
him
was
the
potomac
cold
wide
he
heard
marchmont
break
into
the
wood
and
turned
the
aide
arm
was
raised
and
a
shaft
of
red
sunlight
struck
the
barrel
of
his
pistol
before
his
finger
could
move

the
sorrel
pierced
through

plunged

but
unseating

passed
harmlessly
between
the
branches
of
trees
the
bay
and
his
master
sprang
from
the
low
bank
into
the
flood
so
veiled
was
it
by
the
heavy
mist
that
six
strokes
from
shore
all
outlines
grew
indistinct
the
two
troopers
reached
the
shore
where
is
he
sir
out
there
they
emptied
their
pistols
it
was
firing
into
a
cloud
the
sharpshooters
arrived
skilful
and
grim
they
raised
their
rifles
scanned
the
expanse
of
woolly
white
before
them
and
fired
at
what
now
here
now
there
they
conceived
might
be
a
moving
object
the
mist
lay
close
to
the
river
like
a
pall
they
fired
and
fired
again
other
infantrymen
arriving
talked
excitedly

it
was
a
piece
of
drift
across
the

tall
against
the
south
wreathed
and
linked
by
lianas
of
grape
showed
far
withdrawn
and
shadowy
the
trees
of
the
virginia
shore
the
rifles
continued
to
blaze
but
the
mist
held
and
there
came
no
answering
scream
of
horse
or
cry
of
man
marchmont
spoke
at
last
curtly
that
enough
he
either
hit
and
drowned
or
he
has
reached
home
i
wish
we
were
on
the

one
of
the
troopers
uttered
an
exclamation
hear
that
sir
across
damned
if
he
is
halloaing
to
tell
us
so
faintly
from
the
southern
shore
came
a
voice
it
was
raised
in
a
line
of
song
as
joseph

the

a

in

came
with
suddenness
upon

beneath

the

his

now
from
another
direction
out
of
the

amethyst

that
closed
each

came
a
horse
stepping
high
over
the
fallen

the
rider
not

with
a
pale
handsome

sat
like
a

for

in
a

where

well
his

the

with

the

wore
on
sunny
and
cold
in

sunny
and
cold
above
the

the
water
clear
now
of
mist
sparkled
a
stream
of
diamonds
from

except
where
rose

no

the
diamonds
fell
in
cataracts
a
space
of

falling
gems
another
bit
of
dry

in
the
sun
then
again
brilliancy
and
thunder
of
water
over
the

this
in
sequence
to
the
maryland
side
that
side
reached
there
came
a
mere
ribbon
of
brown
earth
and
beyond
this
ran
the
chesapeake

ohio
canal
boats
from
cumberland
were
going
down
the

with
coal
and
forage
and
boats
from
harper
ferry
were
coming
up
with
a
reinforcing
regiment
of
soldiers
for

at
hancock
it
was
bright
and
lively

and
the
negroes
talked
to
the

on

the
conductors
of

hailed
the

and
the

the

there

a
rebel
spy

away
this
morning
galloped
down
a
cliff
like

took
to

and
if

they
do

no
he
was

he
got
away

he

the

the
echoing

over
on
the
virginia
side
behind
the
friendly
woods
paced
through
by
ashby
men
the
height
of
the
afternoon
saw
the
arrival
of
the
advance
guard
of
that
portion
of
the
army
of
the
valley
which
was
to
cover
operations
against
dam
no
later
in
the
day
came
garnett
with
the
remainder
of
the
stonewall
brigade
and
a
detachment
of
the
rockbridge
artillery
and
by
sunset
the
militia
regiments
were
up
camp
was
pitched
behind
a
line
of
hills
within
the
peninsula
made
by
the
curve
of
the
river
this
rising
ground
masked
the
movement
moreover
with
ashby
between
any
body
of
infantry
and
an
enemy
not
in
unreasonable
force
that
body
worked
and
ate
and
slept
in
peace
of

six
miles
down
the
river
over
on
the
maryland
side
was
williamsport
with
an
infantry
command
and
with
artillery
opposite
dam
no
in
the
maryland
fields
beyond
the
canal
troops
were
posted
guarding
that
very
stretch
of
river
from
a
little
hill
above
the
tents
frowned
their
cannon
at
hancock
at
hagerstown
and
at
frederick
were
other
thousands
and
all
from
the
general
of
the
division
to
the
corporal
drilling
an
awkward
squad
in
the
fields
beside
the
canal
thought
of
the
army
of
the
valley
as
at
winchester
with
the
confederate
advance
guard
riding
little
sorrel
his
cadet
cap
over
his
eyes
his
uniform
whole
and
clean
but
discoloured
like
a
november
leaf
from
rain
and
dust
and
dust
and
rain
with
great
boots
and
heavy
cavalry
spurs
with
his
auburn
beard
and
his
eyes
with
his
forehead
broad
and
high
and
his
aquiline
nose
and
his
mouth
wide
and
came
jackson
the
general
tent
was
a
rude
affair
his
soldiers
pitched
it
beneath
a
pine
beside
a
small
trickling
stream
half
choked
with
leaves
the
staff
was
quartered
to
right
and
left
and
a
clump
of
pines
in
the
rear
served
for
an
arcadian
kitchen
a
and
a
table
made
of
a
board
laid
upon
two
stumps
of
trees
furnished
the
terrace
before
the
tent
here
cleave
coming
to
report
found
his
commander
jackson
was
sitting
feet
planted
as
usual
arms
at
side
as
usual
listening
to
his
chief
of
staff
he
acknowledged
cleave
salute
with
a
glance
a
slight
nod
of
the
head
and
a
motion
of
the
hand
to
one
side
the
young
man
waited
standing
by
a
black
haw
upon
the
bank
of
the
little
stream
the
respectful
murmur
of
the
chief
of
staff
came
to
an
end
very
good
major
you
will
send
a
courier
back
to
falling
waters
to
halt
general
carson
there
he
is
to
be
prepared
to
make
a
diversion
against
williamsport
in
the
morning
i
will
give
precise
instructions
later
what
of
this
mill
by
the
river
it
is
a
very
strong
old
stone
mill
sir
with
windows
it
would
command
any
attack
upon
the
workers
good
good
we
will
put
riflemen
there
as
soon
as
general
garnett
is
up
send
him
to
me
from
the
road
came
a
heavy
rumble
of
wheels
and
the
sound
of
horses
feet
there
are
the
guns
now
sir
yes
they
must
wait
until
nightfall
to
get
into
position
send
captain
mclaughlin
to
me
in
half
an
hour
time
yes
sir
captain
colston
of
the
is
here
very
good
i
will
see
him
now
that
is
all
major
the
chief
of
staff
withdrew
captain
colston
of
the
approached
from
the
shadows
beyond
the
big
pine
and
saluted
you
are
from
this
region
captain
yes
sir
the
colstons
this
stone
mill
is
upon
your
land
yes
sir
my
mother
owns
it
you
have
been
about
the
dam
as
a
boy
yes
sir
in
the
water
above
it
and
in
the
water
below
it
i
know
every
log
i
reckon
it
works
the
mill
if
we
break
it
it
will
work
the
mill
no
longer
in
addition
if
the
enemy
cross
they
will
probably
destroy
the
property
yes
sir
my
mother
and
i
would
not
let
that
weigh
with
us
as
i
know
the
construction
i
should
esteem
it
an
honour
sir
if
i
might
lead
the
party
i
think
i
may
say
that
i
know
where
the
cribs
could
be
most
easily
cut
very
good
then
sir
you
will
report
for
duty
at
nine
captain
holliday
of
the
and
captain
robinson
of
the
with
a
number
of
their
men
have
volunteered
for
this
service
it
is
not
without
danger
as
you
know
that
is
all
captain
colston
departed
now
captain
cleave
said
the
general
a
few
minutes
later
the
report
ended
jackson
refolded
general
letter
to
general
kelly
and
put
it
into
his
good
good
he
said
and
turned
slightly
on
the
so
as
to
face
the
river
and
the
north
it
all
right
captain
it
all
right
i
wish
sir
said
cleave
that
with
ten
times
the
numbers
you
have
you
were
leading
us
across
the
river
we
might
force
a
peace
i
think
and
that
right
quickly
jackson
nodded
yes
sir
i
ought
to
have
every
soldier
in
virginia
if
they
could
be
gotten
here
in
time
every
soldier
in
the
carolinas
there
would
then
be
but
a
streamlet
of
blood
where
now
there
is
going
to
be
a
great
river
the
streamlet
should
run
through
the
land
of
them
with
whom
we
are
righteously
at
war
as
it
is
the
great
river
will
run
through
ours
he
rose
you
have
done
your
mission
well
sir
the
will
be
up
presently
it
took
three
days
to
cut
dam
no
on
the
fourth
the
brigade
went
back
to
winchester
a
week
later
came
loring
with
the
army
of
the
kanawha
and
on
the
third
of
january
the
whole
force
found
itself
again
upon
the
road
in
the
afternoon
the
weather
changed
the
new
year
had
come
in
smiling
mild
as
april
dust
in
the
roads
a
blue
sky
overhead
the
withered
goldenrod
and
gaunt
mullein
stalks
and
dead
asters
by
the
wayside
almost
seemed
to
bloom
again
while
the
winter
wheat
gave
an
actual
vernal
touch
the
long
column
winding
somewhere
no
one
knew
where
but
anyhow
on
the
pugh
town
road
and
in
a
northwesterly
direction
even
old
jack
could
keep
them
from
knowing
that
they
were
going
northwest
was
in
high
spirits
at
least
the
stonewall
brigade
was
in
spirits
it
was
said
that
loring
men
did
want
to
come
anyhow
the
men
whistled
and
sang
laughed
joked
were
lavish
of
opinions
as
to
all
the
world
in
general
and
the
confederate
service
in
particular
they
were
sarcastic
the
confederate
private
was
always
sarcastic
but
throughout
the
morning
there
had
been
small
sting
in
their
remarks
breakfast
at
early
dawn
was
good
and
plentiful
three
days
rations
had
been
served
and
cooked
and
stowed
in
haversacks
but
so
lovely
was
the
weather
so
oppressive
in
the
sunshine
would
be
a
heavy
weight
to
carry
so
obliging
were
the
wagon
drivers
so
easy
in
many
regiments
the
confederate
discipline
that
overcoats
blankets
and
in
very
many
instances
haversacks
had
been
consigned
before
starting
to
the
friendly
care
of
the
wagons
in
the
rear
the
troops
marched
light
and
in
a
good
humour
true
old
jack
seemed
bent
on
getting
there
wherever
there
was
in
a
tremendous
hurry
over
every
smooth
stretch
the
men
were
and
there
was
an
unusual
animus
against
stragglers
there
grew
too
a
moral
certitude
that
from
the
ten
minutes
lawful
rest
in
each
hour
at
least
five
minutes
was
being
filched
another
and
still
more
certain
conclusion
was
that
the
wagon
train
was
getting
very
far
behind
however
the
morning
was
still
sweet
and
the
column
as
a
whole
cheerful
it
was
a
long
column
the
stonewall
brigade
three
brigades
of
loring
five
batteries
and
a
few
cavalry
companies
eight
thousand
five
hundred
men
in
all
arrived
and
the
halt
for
dinner
alas
for
the
men
without
haversacks
they
looked
as
though
they
had
borne
all
the
burdens
of
the
march
there
was
hunger
within
and
scant
sympathy
without
did
the
damned
fools
know
that
old
jack
always
keeps
five
miles
ahead
of
wagon
trains
and
hell
fire
here
saunders
take
these
corn
pones
over
to
those
damned
idiots
with
the
compliments
of
mess
no
we
know
that
they
have
cherrystone
oysters
ducks
terrapin
and
peach
brandy
in
their
haversacks
and
that
they
meant
to
ask
us
to
join
them
so
unfortunate
the
cavalry
marched
on
the
artillery
marched
on
the
infantry
marched
on
the
bright
skies
subtly
changed
the
blue
grew
fainter
a
haze
white
harsh
and
cold
formed
gradually
and
a
slight
wind
began
to
blow
the
aster
and
goldenrod
the
dried
ironweed
and
sumach
the
red
rose
hips
and
magenta
pokeberry
stalks
looked
dead
enough
now
dead
and
dreary
upon
the
weary
weary
road
the
men
sang
no
more
the
more
weakly
shivered
before
long
the
sky
was
an
even
and
the
wind
had
much
increased
coming
from
the
northwest
it
struck
the
column
in
the
face
moreover
it
grew
colder
and
colder
all
types
shivered
now
the
strong
and
the
weak
the
mounted
officer
and
the
private
the
men
with
overcoats
and
the
men
without
the
column
moved
slower
and
slower
all
heads
bent
before
the
wind
which
now
blew
with
violence
it
raised
too
a
blinding
dust
a
curt
order
ran
down
the
lines
for
less
delay
the
regiments
changed
gait
tried
quick
time
along
a
level
stretch
and
left
behind
a
large
number
of
stragglers
the
burst
of
speed
was
for
naught
they
went
the
slower
thereafter
and
coming
to
a
long
bleak
hill
crept
up
it
like
tortoises
but
without
protecting
shells
by
sunset
the
cold
was
intense
word
came
back
that
the
head
of
the
column
was
going
into
camp
and
a
sigh
of
approbation
arose
from
all
but
when
brigade
by
brigade
halted
deployed
and
broke
ranks
it
appeared
that
going
into
camp
was
rather
a
barren
phrase
the
wagons
had
not
come
up
there
were
no
tents
no
blankets
no
provisions
a
northwester
was
blowing
and
the
said
that
there
would
be
snow
ere
morning
the
regiments
spread
over
bare
fields
enclosed
by
rail
fences
there
were
a
small
rapidly
freezing
stream
and
thick
woods
skirting
the
fields
in
the
woods
were
fallen
boughs
and
pine
cones
enough
to
make
the
axes
in
the
company
wagons
not
greatly
missed
and
detachments
were
sent
to
gather
fagots
the
men
cold
and
exhausted
went
but
they
looked
wistfully
at
the
rail
fences
all
around
them
so
easy
to
demolish
so
splendid
to
burn
orders
on
the
subject
were
stringent
will
be
held
responsible
for
any
destruction
of
property
we
are
here
to
protect
and
defend
not
to
the
men
gathered
dead
branches
and
broke
down
others
heaped
them
together
in
the
open
fields
and
made
their
the
rockbridge
artillery
occupied
a
fallow
field
covered
with
fox
grass
dead
michaelmas
daisy
and
drifted
leaves
it
was
a
good
place
for
the
poor
horses
the
battery
thought
but
the
high
wind
blew
sparks
from
the
fires
and
lighted
the
grass
the
flames
spread
and
the
horses
neighed
with
terror
the
battery
was
forced
to
move
taking
up
position
at
last
in
a
ploughed
field
where
the
frozen
furrows
cut
the
feet
and
the
wind
had
the
sweep
of
an
unchained
demon
an
infantry
regiment
fared
better
it
was
in
a
stretch
of
fenced
field
between
the
road
and
the
freezing
brook
a
captain
native
of
that
region
spoke
to
the
and
the
latter
spoke
to
the
men
captain
says
that
we
are
camping
upon
his
land
and
he
sorry
he
ca
give
us
a
better
welcome
but
we
can
have
his
fence
rails
give
him
a
cheer
and
build
your
fires
the
men
cheered
lustily
and
tore
the
rails
apart
and
had
rousing
fires
and
were
comfortable
but
the
next
morning
stonewall
jackson
suspended
from
duty
the
donor
of
his
own
fences
the
brigades
of
loring
undoubtedly
suffered
the
most
they
had
seen
upon
the
monterey
line
on
the
kanawha
the
gauley
and
the
greenbriar
rough
and
exhausting
service
and
then
just
when
they
were
happy
at
last
in
winter
quarters
they
must
pull
up
stakes
and
hurry
down
the
valley
to
join
fool
tom
jackson
of
the
virginia
military
institute
and
one
brief
day
of
glory
at
manassas
loring
a
gallant
and
dashing
officer
was
popular
with
them
fool
tom
jackson
was
not
they
complained
and
they
very
honestly
thought
that
they
had
upon
their
side
justice
common
sense
and
common
humanity
to
say
nothing
of
military
insight
the
bitter
night
was
bitterer
to
them
for
their
discontent
many
were
from
eastern
virginia
or
from
the
states
to
the
south
not
yet
inured
to
the
winter
heights
and
stonewall
jackson
way
they
slept
on
frozen
ground
surrounded
by
grim
mountains
and
they
dreamed
uneasily
of
the
milder
lowlands
of
the
yet
green
tangles
of
bay
and
myrtle
of
quiet
marshes
and
wide
unfreezing
waters
in
the
the
clouds
thickened
and
there
came
down
a
fine
rain
mixed
with
snow
in
the
morning
fields
hillsides
and
road
appeared
glazed
with
ice
and
the
wagons
were
not
up
the
country
grew
rougher
lonelier
a
series
of
low
mountains
and
partly
cleared
levels
to
a
few
in
the
creeping
column
it
may
have
occurred
that
jackson
chose
unfrequented
roads
therefore
narrow
therefore
worse
than
other
roads
to
the
end
that
his
policy
of
utter
secrecy
might
be
the
better
served
but
to
the
majority
his
course
seemed
sprung
from
a
certain
cold
wilfulness
a
harshness
without
object
unless
his
object
were
to
wear
out
flesh
and
bone
the
road
such
as
it
was
was
sheeted
with
ice
the
wind
blew
steadily
from
the
northwest
striking
the
face
like
a
whip
and
the
fine
rain
and
snow
continued
to
fall
and
to
freeze
as
it
fell
what
the
evening
before
had
been
hardship
now
grew
to
actual
misery
the
column
faltered
delayed
halted
and
still
the
order
came
back
the
general
commanding
wishes
the
army
to
press
on
the
army
stumbled
to
its
now
bleeding
feet
and
did
its
best
with
a
hill
like
calvary
up
and
down
the
column
was
heard
the
report
of
muskets
men
falling
and
accidentally
discharging
their
pieces
the
company
officers
lifted
monotonous
voices
weary
and
harsh
as
reeds
by
a
winter
pond
up
men
close
up
close
up
in
the
afternoon
loring
riding
at
the
head
of
his
brigades
sent
a
staff
officer
forward
with
representations
the
latter
spurred
his
horse
but
rapid
travelling
was
impossible
upon
that
road
it
was
long
before
he
overtook
the
rear
of
the
stonewall
brigade
buffeted
by
the
wind
the
grey
uniforms
pale
under
a
glaze
of
sleet
the
red
of
the
colours
the
only
gleam
of
cheer
the
line
crawled
over
a
long
hill
icy
unwooded
swept
by
the
shrieking
wind
stafford
in
passing
exchanged
greetings
with
several
of
the
mounted
officers
these
were
in
as
bad
case
as
their
men
nigh
frozen
themselves
distressed
for
the
horses
beneath
them
and
for
the
staggering
ranks
striving
for
anger
with
the
many
stragglers
and
finding
only
compunction
in
blank
ignorance
as
to
where
they
were
going
and
for
what
knowing
only
that
whereas
they
had
made
seventeen
miles
the
day
before
they
were
not
likely
to
make
seven
he
passed
the
infantry
and
came
up
with
the
artillery
the
steep
road
was
ice
the
horses
were
smooth
shod
the
poor
brutes
slipped
and
fell
cutting
themselves
cruelly
the
men
were
down
in
the
road
lifting
the
horses
dragging
with
them
at
gun
and
caisson
the
crest
of
the
hill
reached
the
carriages
must
be
held
back
kept
from
sliding
sideways
in
the
descent
going
down
was
worse
than
coming
up
the
horses
slipped
and
fell
the
weight
of
gun
and
caisson
came
upon
them
together
they
rolled
to
the
foot
where
they
must
be
helped
up
and
urged
to
the
next
ascent
oaths
went
here
and
there
upon
the
wind
hurt
whinnies
words
of
encouragement
cracking
of
whips
straining
and
groaning
of
gun
carriages
stafford
left
the
artillery
behind
slowly
climbed
another
hill
and
more
slowly
yet
picked
his
way
down
the
glassy
slope
before
him
lay
a
great
stretch
of
meadow
white
with
sleet
and
beyond
it
he
saw
the
advance
guard
disappearing
in
a
fold
of
the
wrinkled
hills
as
he
rode
he
tried
to
turn
his
thoughts
from
the
physical
cold
and
wretchedness
to
some
more
genial
chamber
of
the
brain
he
had
imaginative
power
ability
to
build
for
himself
out
of
the
void
it
had
served
him
well
in
the
past
but
not
so
well
the
last
year
or
two
he
tried
now
to
turn
the
ring
and
pass
from
the
bitter
day
and
road
into
some
haunt
of
warmth
and
peace
albemarle
and
summer
greenwood
and
a
quiet
garden
that
did
not
answer
harassment
longing
sore
desire
check
and
bitterness
unhappiness
there
as
here
he
tried
other
resting
places
that
once
had
answered
poets
meadows
of
asphodel
days
and
nights
culled
like
a
bouquet
from
years
spent
in
a
foreign
land
old
snatches
out
of
boyhood
these
answered
no
longer
nor
did
a
closing
of
the
eyes
and
a
sinking
downward
downward
through
the
stratas
of
being
into
some
cavern
reckonless
and
quiet
of
the
it
as
little
served
to
front
the
future
and
try
to
climb
like
jack
of
the
beanstalk
to
some
plane
above
and
beyond
war
and
disappointment
and
denying
he
was
unhappy
and
he
spoke
wearily
to
his
horse
then
shut
his
lips
and
faced
the
siberian
road
entering
in
his
turn
the
fold
of
the
hills
he
soon
came
up
with
the
advance
as
he
passed
the
men
on
foot
a
sudden
swirl
of
snow
came
in
larger
flakes
from
the
leaden
skies
before
him
were
a
dozen
horsemen
riding
slowly
the
air
was
now
filled
with
the
great
white
flakes
the
men
ahead
in
their
caped
overcoats
with
their
hats
drawn
low
plodding
on
tired
horses
between
the
hills
all
seen
vaguely
through
the
snow
veil
had
a
sudden
wintry
desolate
and
seeming
he
said
to
himself
that
they
were
ghosts
from
fifty
years
back
ghosts
of
the
grand
army
in
the
grasp
of
general
january
he
made
what
haste
he
could
and
came
up
with
stonewall
jackson
riding
with
ashby
and
with
his
staff
all
checked
their
horses
the
general
a
little
advanced
stafford
facing
him
from
general
loring
sir
good
what
does
he
want
there
is
much
suffering
among
his
men
sir
they
have
seen
hard
service
and
they
have
faced
it
gallantly
are
his
men
insubordinate
not
at
all
sir
but
you
are
i
believe
the
officer
whom
general
loring
sent
me
once
before
yes
general
many
of
the
men
are
without
rations
others
are
almost
barefoot
the
great
number
are
unused
to
mountain
work
or
to
so
rigorous
a
climate
the
commanding
general
sat
regarding
the
emissary
with
a
curious
chill
blankness
in
peace
to
the
outward
eye
he
was
a
commonplace
man
in
war
he
changed
the
authority
with
which
he
was
clothed
went
no
doubt
for
much
but
it
was
rather
perhaps
that
a
door
had
been
opened
for
him
his
inner
self
became
visible
and
that
imposingly
the
man
was
there
a
firm
man
indomitable
a
thunderbolt
of
war
a
praying
and
worshipping
more
or
less
ambitious
not
always
just
patriotically
devoted
fatalist
and
enthusiast
a
mysterious
and
commanding
genius
of
an
iron
sort
when
he
was
angered
it
was
as
though
the
offender
had
managed
to
antagonize
some
natural
law
or
force
or
mass
such
an
one
had
to
face
not
an
irritated
human
organism
but
a
gibraltar
armed
for
the
encounter
the
men
who
found
themselves
confronted
by
this
anger
could
and
did
brace
themselves
against
it
but
it
was
with
some
hopelessness
of
feeling
as
of
hostility
upon
a
plane
where
they
were
at
a
disadvantage
the
man
now
sitting
his
horse
before
him
on
the
endless
winter
road
was
one
not
easily
daunted
by
outward
aspects
nevertheless
he
had
at
this
moment
in
the
back
of
his
head
a
weary
consciousness
that
war
was
roseate
only
to
young
boys
and
girls
that
the
day
was
cold
and
drear
the
general
hostile
the
earth
overlaid
with
dull
misery
that
the
immortals
if
there
were
any
must
be
clamouring
for
the
curtain
to
descend
forever
upon
this
shabby
human
stage
painful
and
sordid
with
its
strutting
tragedians
and
its
bellman
cry
of
the
snow
came
down
thickly
in
large
flakes
a
horse
shook
himself
rubbed
his
nose
against
his
neck
and
whinnied
mournfully
the
pause
which
had
seemed
long
was
not
really
so
jackson
turned
toward
the
group
of
waiting
officers
major
cleave
cleave
pushed
his
horse
a
little
into
the
road
sir
you
will
return
with
this
officer
to
general
loring
command
it
is
far
in
the
rear
you
will
give
general
loring
this
note
as
he
spoke
he
wrote
upon
a
leaf
torn
from
his
the
words
as
he
traced
them
read
jackson
compliments
to
general
loring
he
has
some
fault
to
find
with
the
zeal
of
general
loring
his
officers
and
men
general
loring
will
represent
to
himself
that
in
war
soldiers
are
occasionally
called
upon
to
travel
in
winter
weather
campaigns
can
not
always
be
conducted
in
seasons
of
roses
general
loring
will
urge
his
men
forward
without
further
complaint
jackson
he
folded
the
leaf
and
gave
it
to
richard
cleave
then
touched
little
sorrel
with
his
heavy
spur
and
with
ashby
and
the
staff
rode
on
through
the
falling
snow
between
the
hills
the
small
cavalry
advance
passed
too
grey
and
in
the
grasp
of
general
january
disappearing
within
the
immense
and
floating
veil
of
the
snow
when
all
were
gone
stafford
and
cleave
turned
their
horses
heads
toward
the
distant
column
vaguely
seen
in
the
falling
day
stafford
made
an
expressive
sound
i
am
sorry
said
cleave
gravely
but
when
you
have
been
with
him
longer
you
will
understand
him
better
i
think
that
he
is
really
mad
the
other
shook
his
head
he
is
not
mad
do
get
that
idea
stafford
it
hard
on
the
troops
poor
fellows
how
the
snow
falls
we
had
better
turn
out
and
let
the
guns
pass
they
moved
into
the
untrodden
snow
lying
in
the
fence
corners
and
watched
the
guns
the
horses
and
men
strain
past
with
a
sombre
noise
officers
and
men
knew
richard
cleave
and
several
hailed
him
where
in
hell
are
we
going
cleave
old
jack
likes
you
tell
him
wo
you
that
it
damned
hard
on
the
horses
and
we
have
much
to
eat
ourselves
tell
him
even
the
guns
are
complaining
tell
him
yes
sir
get
up
there
selim
pull
flora
pull
whoa
damnation
come
lay
a
hand
to
this
gun
boys
where
hetterich
hetterich
this
damned
wheel
off
again
the
delay
threatening
to
be
considerable
the
two
men
rode
on
picking
their
way
keeping
to
the
low
bank
or
using
the
verge
of
the
crowded
road
at
last
they
left
the
artillery
and
found
themselves
again
upon
a
lonely
way
i
love
that
arm
said
cleave
there
is
a
gun
there
that
is
alive
to
me
he
turned
in
his
saddle
and
looked
back
at
the
last
caisson
vanishing
over
the
hill
shall
you
remain
with
the
staff
no
only
through
this
campaign
i
prefer
the
line
the
snow
fell
so
fast
that
the
trampled
and
discoloured
road
was
again
whitening
beneath
it
half
a
mile
ahead
was
visible
the
stonewall
brigade
coming
very
slowly
beaten
by
the
wind
blinded
by
the
snow
a
spectral
grey
serpent
upon
the
winding
road
stafford
spoke
abruptly
i
am
in
your
debt
for
the
arrangements
i
found
made
for
me
in
winchester
i
have
had
no
opportunity
to
thank
you
you
were
extremely
good
so
to
trouble
yourself
it
was
no
trouble
as
i
told
you
once
before
i
am
anxious
to
serve
you
they
met
the
brigade
garnett
riding
at
the
head
richard
cleave
he
said
we
are
all
bound
for
siberia
i
think
company
by
company
the
regiments
staggered
by
in
the
whirling
snow
the
colours
gripped
by
stiffening
hands
there
were
blood
stains
on
the
frozen
ground
oh
the
shoes
the
shoes
that
a
country
with
closed
ports
had
to
make
in
haste
and
send
its
soldiers
oh
the
muskets
heavy
dull
ungleaming
weighting
the
fiercely
aching
shoulders
oh
the
snow
mounded
on
cap
on
cartridge
box
on
rolled
blanket
and
haversack
oh
the
northwest
wind
like
a
lash
the
pinched
stomach
the
dry
lips
the
wavering
sight
the
weariness
excessive
the
strong
men
were
breathing
hard
their
brows
drawn
together
and
upward
the
weaker
soldiers
had
a
ghastly
look
as
of
life
shrunk
to
a
point
up
men
close
up
close
up
farther
down
the
line
on
the
white
bank
to
which
they
tried
to
keep
the
column
almost
filling
the
narrow
road
cleave
checked
his
horse
i
have
a
brother
in
this
regiment
and
he
has
been
ill
a
company
came
stumbling
by
heads
bent
before
the
bitter
wind
he
spoke
to
its
captain
the
captain
spoke
to
a
lieutenant
the
lieutenant
to
a
private
in
the
colour
guard
who
at
once
fell
out
of
line
and
sprang
somewhat
stiffly
across
the
wayside
depression
to
the
two
horsemen
drawn
up
upon
the
bank
well
richard
it
snowing
have
you
had
anything
to
eat

and
it
was
lovely
so
far
as

he
laughed
ruefully
only
i
still
that
typhoid
fever
appetite
his
brother
took
from
under
the
cape
of
his
coat
a
small
parcel
here

some
slices
of
bread
and
meat

glistened
as
he
put
out
a
gaunt
young
hand
and
took
the
parcel
wo
rat
and
i
have
a
feast
we
were
just
talking
of
old
judge
at
the
institute
and
of
how
good
his
warm
loaves
used
to
taste
seems
like
an
answer
to
prayer
thank
you
richard
miriam
comforter
there
a
fellow
a
clerk
from
the
store
at
balcony
falls
who
much
stamina
and
no
shoes
at
all
they
were
bad
when
he
started
and
one
fell
to
pieces
yesterday
and
he
left
most
of
the
other
on
that
bad
piece
of
road
this
morning
so
at
the
last
halt
we
cut
my
comforter
in
two
and
tied
up
his
feet
with
it
i
did
need
it
anyway
he
looked
over
his
shoulder
well
i
better
be
catching
up
richard

a
hand
upon
his
arm

an
oilcloth
oh

could
sleep
now
he
spoke
dreamily
right
in
that
fence
corner
does
it
look
soft
and
white
like
a
feather
bed
with
lovely
clean
sheets
the
fence
rails
make
it
look
like
my
old
crib
at
home
he
pulled
himself
together
with
a
jerk
you
take
care
of
yourself
richard
i
all
right
rat
and
i
were
soldiers
before
the
war
broke
out
he
was
gone
stumbling
stiffly
across
to
the
road
running
stiffly
to
overtake
his
company
his
brother
looked
after
him
with
troubled
eyes
then
with
a
sigh
picked
up
the
reins
and
followed
stafford
toward
the
darkening
east
the
two
going
one
way
the
haggard

seemed
interminable

glanced
disconsolately
down
at
a
torn
cuff
and
a
great
smear
of
frozen
mire
adorning
his

i
rather
glad

the

went
by
there
was
again
a
stretch
of
horribly
cut
road
empty
save
for
here
and
there
poor
stragglers
sitting
dismally
huddled
together
beneath
a
cedar
or
limping
on
painful
feet
hoping
somewhere
to
overtake
the
boys
a
horse
had
fallen
dead
and
had
been
dragged
out
of
the
road
and
through
a
gap
in
the
fencing
into
a
narrow
field
beyond
this
on
the
farther
boundary
of
grey
rails
three
buzzards
were
sitting
seen
like
hobgoblins
through
the
veiling
snow
the
afternoon
was
closing
in
it
could
only
be
said
that
the
world
was
a
dreary
one
the
army
of
the
kanawha
loring
three
brigades
with
the
batteries
attached
came
into

a
long
way
off
grey
streaks
upon
the
road
before
the
two
horsemen
reached
it
it
had
halted
for
the
night
broken
ranks
and
flowed
into
the
desolate
fields
there
was
yet
an
hour
of
daylight
but
discontent
had
grown
marked
the
murmuring
loud
and
the
halt
was
made
a
few
of
the
wagons
were
up
and
a
dark
and
heavy
wood
filling
a
ravine
gave
fagots

the

corbin
wood
chaplain
to
one
of
loring
regiments
coming
down
from
the
hillside
where
he
had
spent
the
night
very
literally
like
a
shepherd
found
the
little
stream
at
its
foot
frozen
to
the
bottom
no
morning
bath
for
a
lover
of
cleanliness
there
had
been
little
water
indeed
to
expend
on
any
toilet
since
leaving
winchester
corbin
wood
tried
snow
for
his
face
and
hands
but
the
snow
was
no
longer
soft
as
it
had
fallen
the
day
before
it
was
frozen
and
harsh
and
the
holy
hermits
and
the
saints
on
pillars
never
had
a
bath
apparently
never
wanted
one
reveille
sounded
drearily
enough
from
the
surrounding
mountains
the
fires
sprang
up
but
they
did
not
burn
brightly
in
the
livid
day
the
little
there
was
to
eat
was
warmed
and
eaten
when
afterwards
the
rolls
were
called
there
were
silences
mr
faint
heart
mr
fearing
and
also
mr
honesty
really
too
ill
to

somewhere
on
the

by

like

grey
and
cold
sluggish
unburnished
dull
and
bewildered
the
column
took
the
road
deeply
cut
the
day
before
by
the
cavalry
by
garnett
brigade
and
by
the
artillery
the
road
was
horrible
what
had
been
ridged
snow
was
now
ridged
ice
corbin
wood
and
his
old
grey
horse
were
loved
by
their
regiment
the
chaplain
was
not
physically
a
strong
man
and
his
ways
were
those
of
a
scholar
but
the
regiment
found
them
lovable
pluto
the
horse
was
very
wise
very
old
very
strong
and
gentle
upon
the
march
he
was
of
use
to
many
beside
his
master
the
regiment
had
grown
accustomed
to
the
sight
of
the
chaplain
walking
through
dust
or
mud
at
the
bridle
of
the
grey
saying
now
and
then
a
word
in
a
sober
and
cheerful
fashion
to
the
or
wholly
weary
private
seated
in
his
saddle
he
was
forever
giving
some
one
a
lift
along
the
road
certain
things
that
have
had
small
place
in
the
armies
of
the
world
were
commonplaces
in
the
confederate
service
the
man
on
horseback
was
a
more
fortunate
but
not
a
better
man
not
even
a
better
born
or
educated
man
than
he
on
foot
the
long
grey
lines
saw
nothing
strange
in
a
dismounted
officer
giving
a
cast
of
the
road
to
a
comrade
in
the
ranks
so
the
horse
was
rather
for
everybody
than
for
the
chaplain
himself

old
college
mate
slipping
stiffly
to
earth
after
five
inestimable
minutes

the
sleet
fell
and
fell
and
it
was
intensely
cold
the
wagons
were
invisible
it
was
rumoured
that
they
had
taken
another
road
the
country
was
almost
a
wilderness
at
long
intervals
the

came
upon
a
lonely
farmhouse
or
a

cabin
a
mill
a

a
foraging
party
with
orders
to
purchase
all
supplies
hardly
anything
was
gotten
little
had
been
made
this
year
and
little
stored
moreover
latterly
the
yankees
at

had
taken
all
the
stock
and
poultry
and
corn

paying
for
it

certain
as
it
sleeting
where
old
jack
going
the
news
running
along
the
column
awoke
a
small
flare
of
interest

it
filled
no
empty

dissipated

numbing
cold
the
momentary
enthusiasm
passed

and
all
the

in

a
corps
of

broke
with
pickaxes
the
solid
and
treacherous
surface
roughening
the

it
was
impossible

could
not
be
given
over
grey
glass
with
the
closing
in
of
the
ghostly
day
in
a
stretch
of
fields
beside
a
frozen
stream
the
column
halted
there
were
no
tents
and
there
was
scarcely
anything
to
eat
one
of
the
fields
was
covered
by
stacked
corn
and
it
was
discovered
that
the
ear
had
been
left
in
the
driving
sleet
the
men
tore
apart
the
shocks
and
with
numbed
fingers
stripped
from
the
grain
the
sere
rough
and
icy
husks
they
and
the
horses
ate
the
yellow
corn
all
night
stupid
with
misery
the
soldiers
dozed
and
muttered
beside
the
wretched
fires
one
a
lawyer
clerk
cried
like
a
child
with
his
hands
scored
till
they
bled
by
the
frozen
corn
husks
down
the
stream
stood
a
deserted
sawmill
and
here
the
rockbridge
men
found
planks
with
which
they
made
for
themselves
little
pens
the
sleet
sounded
for
hours
on
the
boards
that
served
for
roof
but
at
last
it
died
away
the
exhausted
army
slept
but
when
in
the
grey
dawn
it
stirred
and
rose
to
the
wailing
of
the
bugles
it
threw
off
a
weight
of
snow
all
the
world
was
white
again
beneath
a
livid
sky
this
day
they
made
four
miles
the
grey
trees
were
draped
with
ice
the
grey
zigzag
of
the
fences
was
gliding
ice
under
the
hands
that
caught
at
it
the
hands
of
the
sick
and
weak
motion
resolved
itself
into
a
dead
march
few
notes
and
slow
with
rests
the

moved

stateliness

that
night
they
lay
down
and
slept
behind
a
screen
of

and
awoke
in
an
amethyst
dawn
to
a
sky
of
promise
the
light

from

glorious
the

the

suddenly
swung
from
the
main
road
and
moved
across
the
fields
to
the
ridges
overlooking
the
town
apparently
they
had
gathered
their
strength
into
a
ball
for
they
went
with
energy
over
the
snow
the
afternoon
before

and

had
been
detached
disappearing
to

right

ran
through

up

with
rapidity
when

reached
the
crest
the

saw
the

far
before

below
them
charging
upon
the
town
and
shouting
after
the

came
a
body
of
skirmishers
then
pouring
down
the
hillside
the
tennessee
and
the
virginia
yelling
as
they
ran
from
the
town
burst
a
loud
rattle
of
musketry
and
from
a
height
beyond
a
cannon
thundered
all
the

sides

hills
no
bagatelle
they
were
not
in
time
to
secure
the
roads
the
confederate
cavalry
dividing
followed
full
tilt
the
retreating
foe
a
courier
brought
back
to
the
artillery
a
curt
order
from
jackson
to
push
on
by
the
hancock
road
as
he
turned
his
mare
slipped
and
the
two
came
crashing
down
upon
the
icy
road
when
they
had
struggled
up
and
out
of
the
way
the
batteries
passed
rumbling
through
the
town
old
men
and
boys
were
out
upon
the
trampled
sidewalks
and
at
window
and
door
women
and
children
waved
handkerchiefs
clapped
hands
at
a
corner
in
the
middle
of
the
street
lay
a
horse
just
lifeless
covered
with
blood
the
sight
maddened
the
battery
horses
they
reared
and
plunged
but
at
last
went
trembling
by
from
the
patriarchs
and
the
eager
boys
came
information
the
yankees
were
gone
but
not
their
baggage
and
stores
everything
had
been
left
behind
there
were
army
blankets
tents
oilcloths
clothing
cords
of
firewood
forage
for
the
horses
flour
and
fresh
meat
sugar
coffee
sutlers
stores
of
every
kind
wines
spirits
cigars
oh
everything
the
artillery
groaned
and
swore
but
obeyed
orders
leaving
capua
behind
it
strained
along
the
hancock
road
in
the
wake
of
the
pursuing
cavalry
and
the
fleeing
federals
the
main
body
of
the
latter
well
in
advance
and
with
no
exhausting
march
behind
them
to
weaken
horse
and
man
reached
the
potomac
by
the
hancock
road
at
a
point
where
they
had
boats
moored
and
got
clean
away
joining
lander
on
the
maryland
shore
the
lesser
number
making
for
sir
john
run
and
the
big
cacapon
and
followed
by
some
companies
of
ashby
did
not
so
quickly
escape
the
confederate
advance
came
artillery
horse
and
skirmishers
upon
the
river
bank
at
sunset
all
around
were
great
rolling
hills
quite
bare
of
trees
and
covered
with
snow
over
which
the
setting
sun
threw
a
crimson
tinge
below
was
the
river
hoarsely
murmuring
and
immediately
upon
the
other
side
the
clustering
maryland
village
with
a
church
spire
tall
and
tapering
against
the
northern
sky
about
the
village
was
another
village
of
tents
and
upon
a
hilltop
frowned
a
line
of
guns
dusk
as
it
was
the
confederate
batteries
unlimbered
and
there
opened
an
artillery
duel
shells
screaming
from
north
to
south
and
south
to
north
across
the
river
yet
stained
with
the
sunset
glow
that
night
the
infantry
remained
at
bath
warmed
and
comforted
by
the
captured
stores
they
came
like
a
gift
from
the
gods
and
as
is
usual
with
that
gift
they
disappeared
in
a
twinkling
in
the
afternoon
the
three
arms
met
on
the
river
bank
the
sky
was
again
a
level
grey
it
was
evident
that
a
snowstorm
was
brewing
there
was
not
a
house
except
for
the
fringe
along
the
water
edge
there
was
hardly
a
tree
the
hills
were
all
bare
the
snow
was
packed
so
hard
and
so
mingled
with
ice
that
when
in
the
cannonading
the
federal
missiles
struck
and
tore
it
up
the
fragments
were
as
keen
and
troublesome
almost
as
splinters
of
shell
there
was
no
shelter
little
wood
for
burning
the
men
gazed
about
them
with
a
frown
of
uneasiness
the
storm
set
in
with
a
whirl
of
snow
and
with
a
wind
that
raved
like
a
madman
and
broke
the
spectral
white
arms
of
the
sycamores
by
the
river
in
a
short
time
there
was
a
shifting
wonderful
numbing
veil
streaming
silent
from
the
grey
heavens
it
was
almost
a
relief
when
dark
came
and
wrapped
the
great
lonely
ghostly
countryside
this
night
the
men
disregarded
the
taboo
and
burned
every
available
fence
rail
in
the
morning
a
boat
was
put
across
the
river
it
bore
a
summons
to
lander
to
surrender
the
alternative
being
a
bombardment
of
the
town
retaliation
for
shepherdstown
read
jackson
missive
ashby
bore
the
summons
and
was
led
blindfold
through
the
streets
to
headquarters
lander
looking
momently
for
reinforcements
from
williamsport
declined
to
surrender
ashby
passed
blindfolded
out
of
the
town
entered
the
boat
and
came
back
to
stonewall
jackson
the
latter
waited
two
hours
then
began
to
throw
shells
into
the
town
since
early
morning
a
force
had
been
engaged
in
constructing
two
miles
up
the
river
a
rude
bridge
by
which
the
troops
might
cross
the
evening
before
there
had
been
skirmishes
at
sir
john
run
and
at
the
big
cacapon
a
regiment
of
loring
destroyed
the
railroad
bridge
over
the
latter
stream
the
federals
withdrew
across
the
river
leaving
no
command
in
morgan
county
throughout
the
afternoon
mclaughlin
battery
dropped
shells
into
hancock
but
an
hour
before
dark
came
orders
to
cease
firing
a
scout
allan
gold
brought
tidings
of
heavy
reinforcements
pouring
into
the
town
from
williamsport
and
hagerstown
so
heavy
were
they
that
jackson
after
standing
for
five
minutes
with
his
face
to
the
north
sent
orders
to
discontinue
work
upon
the
bridge
romney
when
all
was
said
not
hancock
was
his
destination
kelly
eight
thousand
in
virginia
not
lander
brigades
across
the
line
doubtless
it
had
been
his
hope
to
capture
every
federal
in
bath
to
reach
and
cross
the
potomac
inflict
damage
and
retire
before
those
reinforcements
could
come
up
but
the
infantry
which
he
commanded
was
not
yet
his
foot
cavalry
and
neither
knew
nor
trusted
him
as
it
was
to
know
and
trust
the
forces
about
him
were
not
homogeneous
they
pulled
two
ways
they
were
not
moulded
and
coloured
as
they
were
to
be
moulded
and
coloured
not
instinct
with
the
one
man
view
as
they
were
to
become
instinct
they
were
not
iron
as
he
was
iron
nor
yet
thunderbolts
of
war
they
could
not
divine
the
point
and
hour
of
attack
and
sooth
to
say
they
received
scant
assistance
from
the
actual
wizard
they
were
patriot
forces
simple
and
manly
souls
ready
enough
to
die
for
their
cause
but
few
were
yet
at
the
arrowhead
of
concentration
as
was
this
man
they
were
to
attain
it
but
not
yet
he
looked
at
the
north
and
he
looked
at
his
complaining
legions
and
he
strode
off
to
his
bivouac
beneath
a
solitary
tree
here
a
little
later
he
gave
orders
to
his
brigadiers
the
army
of
the
northwest
would
resume
the
march
at
early
dawn
in
the
harsh
coldness
of
the
morning
they
retraced
the
road
to
bath
a
frightful
road
a
road
over
which
an
army
had
passed
at
noon
they
came
to
bath
but
there
was
hardly
a
pause
in
the
town
beneath
a
sky
of
lead
in
a
harsh
and
freezing
wind
the
troops
swung
slowly
into
a
narrow
road
running
west
through
a
meagre
valley
low
hills
were
on
either
side
low
and
bleak
scrub
oak
and
pine
grew
sparsely
and
along
the
edges
of
the
road
dead
milkweed
and
mullein
stood
gaunt
above
the
snow
the
troops
passed
an
old
cider
press
and
a
cabin
or
two
out
of
which
negroes
stared
before
long
they
crossed
a
creek
and
began
to
climb
all
the
landscape
was
now
mountainous
to
the
right
as
the
way
mounted
opened
a
great
view
white
dales
and
meadows
far
winter
forests
and
the
long
long
wall
of
north
mountain
there
was
small
care
for
the
view
among
the
struggling
soldiers
the
hills
seemed
perpendicular
the
earth
treacherous
glass
going
up
the
artillerymen
must
drag
with
the
horses
at
gun
and
caisson
going
down
the
carriages
must
be
held
back
else
they
would
slide
sideways
and
go
crashing
over
the
embankment
again
and
again
going
down
the
horses
slipped
and
fell
the
weight
of
metal
behind
coming
upon
them
the
whole
slid
in
a
heap
to
the
bottom
there
they
must
be
gotten
to
their
feet
the
poor
trembling
brutes
and
set
to
the
task
of
another
hill
the
long
grey
halting
stumbling
creeping
line
saw
no
beauty
in
the
winter
woods
in
the
arched
fern
over
the
snow
in
the
vivid
fairy
plots
of
moss
in
the
smooth
tall
ailanthus
stems
by
the
wayside
in
the
swinging
leafless
lianas
of
grape
pendent
from
the
highest
trees
in
the
imposing
view
of
the
mountains
the
line
was
sick
sick
to
the
heart
numbed
and
shivering
full
of
pain
every
ambulance
and
wagon
used
as
ambulance
was
heavy
laden
at
every
infrequent
cabin
or
lonely
farmhouse
were
left
the
too
ill
to
travel
farther
the
poor
servants
of
whom
there
were
some
in
each
company
were
in
pitiable
plight
no
negro
likes
the
cold
for
him
all
the
hot
sunshine
he
can
get
they
shivered
now
in
the
rear
of
the
companies
their
bodies
drawn
together
their
faces
grey
the
nature
of
most
was
of
an
abounding
cheerfulness
but
it
was
not
possible
to
be
cheerful
on
this
january
road
to
romney
the
army
crossed
sleepy
creek
it
was
frozen
to
the
bottom
the
cedars
along
its
shore
stood
so
funereally
so
and
dark
the
sycamores
were
so
and
long
of
arm
the
great
birds
slowly
circling
above
a
neighbouring
wood
of
so
dreary
a
significance
that
the
heart
sank
and
sank
was
this
war
war
heroic
and
glorious
with
banners
trumpets
and
rewarded
enterprise
manassas
had
been
war
for
one
brief
summer
day
but
ever
since
there
was
only
marching
tenting
suffering
and
fatigue
and
fatigue
and
fatigue
maury
stafford
and
the
reverend
corbin
wood
found
themselves
riding
side
by
side
with
other
mounted
officers
in
advance
of
leading
regiment
the
chaplain
had
experienced
the
day
before
an
ugly
fall
his
knee
was
badly
wrenched
and
so
perforce
he
rode
though
as
often
as
he
thought
the
grey
could
stand
it
he
took
up
a
man
behind
him
now
however
he
was
riding
single
indeed
for
the
last
mile
he
had
uttered
no
pitiful
comment
and
given
no
invitation
moreover
he
talked
persistently
and
was
forever
calling
his
attention
to
the
beauty
of
the
view
at
last
after
a
series
of
short
answers
it
occurred
to
stafford
to
regard
him
more
closely
there
was
a
colour
in
the
chaplain
cheek
and
he
swayed
ever
so
slightly
and
rhythmically
in
his
saddle
stafford
checked
his
horse
drew
his
hand
out
of
an
gauntlet
and
leaning
over
laid
it
on
the
which
was
bare
the
chaplain
skin
was
burning
hot
stafford
made
a
sound
of
concern
and
rode
forward
to
the
colonel
in
a
minute
he
returned
now
you
and
i
wood
will
fall
out
here
and
just
quietly
wait
until
the
wagons
come
by
then
the
doctor
will
fix
you
up
nicely
in
the
ambulance
oh
yes
you
are
you
ill
enough
to
want
to
lie
down
for
awhile
some
one
else
you
know
can
ride
pluto
corbin
wood
pondered
the
matter
that
true
that
very
true
my
dear
maury
fontaine
now
behind
us
in
the
ranks
his
shoes
are
all
worn
out
fontaine
eh
fontaine
knows
more
greek
than
any
man
and
he
be
good
to
pluto
pluto
almost
worn
out
himself
he
not
immortal
like
xanthius
and
balius
do
you
know
maury
it
little
wonder
that
gulliver
found
the
houyhnhnms
so
detesting
war
horses
have
a
dreadful
lot
in
war
and
the
quarrel
never
theirs
do
but
look
at
that
stream
how
cool
and
pleasant
winding
between
the
willows
stafford
got
him
to
one
side
of
the
road
to
a
small
plateau
beneath
an
overhanging
bank
the
column
was
now
crawling
through
a
ravine
with
a
sheer
descent
on
the
right
to
the
frozen
creek
below
to
the
left
covering
the
were
masses
of
evergreen
kalmia
and
above
them
tall
and
leafless
trees
in
whose
branches
the
wind
made
a
grating
sound
the
sleet
was
falling
again
a
veil
of
sleet
the
two
waiting
for
the
ambulance
looked
down
upon
the
grey
soldiers
grey
weary
and
bent
before
the
wind
who
would
ever
have
thought
said
the
chaplain
that
dante
took
an
idea
from
virginia
in
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
i
remember
things
being
so
happy
and
comfortable
but
it
must
have
been
long
ago
yes
my
people
long
ago
dropping
the
bridle
he
raised
his
arm
in
a
gesture
usual
with
him
in
the
pulpit
in
the
fading
light
there
was
about
him
an
illusion
of
black
and
white
he
moved
his
arm
as
though
it
were
clad
in
the
sleeve
of
a
surplice
i
am
not
often
denunciatory
he
said
but
i
denounce
this
weary
going
to
and
fro
this
turning
like
a
dervish
this
finding
that
every
straight
line
is
but
a
fraction
of
a
circle
this
squirrel
cage
with
the
greenwood
never
reached
this
interminable
drama
this
dance
of
midges
through
a
circle
that
ever
returneth
in
to
the
selfsame
spot
and
much
of
madness
and
more
of
sin
and
horror
the
soul
of
the
plot
is
it
not
wonderful
the
gold
light
on
the
mountains
at
last
the
ambulance
appeared
a
good
one
captured
at
manassas
the
chaplain
still
talking
was
persuaded
stiffly
to
dismount
to
give
pluto
bridle
into
stafford
hand
and
to
enter
there
were
other
occupants
two
rows
of
them
stafford
saw
his
old
friend
laid
in
a
corner
on
a
wisp
of
straw
then
finding
fontaine
in
the
ranks
gave
over
the
grey
and
joined
the
staff
creeping
creeping
on
tired
horses
through
the
sleet
cavalry
and
infantry
and
wagon
train
wound
at
the
close
of
day
over
a
vast
bare
hilltop
toward
unger
store
where
it
was
known
would
be
the
bivouac
the
artillery
in
the
rear
found
it
impossible
to
finish
out
the
march
two
miles
from
unger
the
halt
was
ordered
it
was
full
dark
neither
man
nor
brute
could
stumble
farther
all
came
to
a
stand
high
up
on
the
hill
the
guns
were
left
in
the
road
the
horses
led
down
the
slope
and
picketted
in
the
lee
of
a
poor
stable
placed
there
it
seemed
by
some
pitying
chance
in
the
stable
there
was
even
found
some
hay
and
corn
the
men
had
no
supper
or
only
such
crumbs
as
were
found
in
the
haversacks
they
made
their
fires
on
the
hillside
and
crouched
around
them
nodding
uneasily
trying
to
sleep
with
faces
scorched
by
the
flame
and
freezing
backs
they
put
their
feet
in
the
sodden
shoes
to
the
fire
and
the
poor
leather
fell
into
yet
greater
holes
there
was
some
conjecture
as
to
how
far
the
thermometer
stood
below
zero
some
put
it
at
forty
but
the
more
conservative
declared
for
twenty
it
was
impossible
to
sleep
and
every
one
was
hungry
and
the
tobacco
was
all
out
were
they
doing
at
home
by
the
fire
after
supper
with
the
children
playing
about
at
dawn
the
bugles
blew
stiff
and
sore
racked
with
pains
and
aches
coughing
limping
savagely
hungry
the
men
rose
time
was
to
come
when
even
a
dawn
like
this
would
be
met
by
the
confederate
soldier
with
whimsical
cheer
with
greetings
as
to
an
friend
with
a
courage
quaint
pathetic
and
divinely
high
but
the
time
was
not
yet
the
men
swore
and
groaned
the
haversacks
were
quite
empty
there
would
be
no
breakfast
until
the
wagons
were
caught
up
with
at
unger
the
drivers
went
down
the
hillside
for
the
horses
when
they
came
to
the
strength
that
had
drawn
the
guns
and
looked
there
was
a
silence
hetterich
the
blacksmith
was
with
the
party
and
hetterich
wept
if
i
was
god
i
would
have
it
i
would
have
a
horse
treated
so
just
look
at
flora
just
look
at
her
knees
ah
the
poor
brute
so
frequent
had
been
the
falls
of
the
day
before
so
often
had
the
animals
been
cut
by
the
carriages
coming
upon
them
that
many
were
scarred
in
a
dreadful
fashion
the
knees
of
flora
had
been
badly
cut
and
what
hetterich
pointed
at
were
long
red
icicles
hanging
from
the
wounds
at
unger
the
evening
before
in
a
narrow
valley
between
the
silver
hills
the
infantry
stacked
arms
broke
ranks
and
listened
with
sullen
brows
to
two
pieces
of
news
at
hanging
rock
between
unger
and
romney
the
advance
composed
of
a
regiment
of
militia
and
a
section
of
artillery
had
come
into
touch
with
the
enemy
the
militia
had
broken
the
two
guns
had
been
lost
fool
tom
jackson
was
reported
to
have
said
good
good
and
lifted
that
right
hand
of
his
to
the
sky
the
other
tidings
were
to
the
effect
that
the
troops
would
rest
at
for
three
days
to
the
end
chiefly
that
the
horses
might
be
rest
delicious
sound
but
unger
to
the
east
the
unutterably
bleak
hills
over
which
they
had
toiled
to
the
west
capon
mountain
high
and
stark
against
the
livid
skies
to
the
south
a
dark
forest
with
the
snow
beneath
the
trees
to
the
north
long
low
hills
with
faded
broomsedge
waving
in
the
wind
upon
a
hilltop
perched
a
country
store
a
blacksmith
shop
and
one
or
two
farmhouses
forlorn
and
lonely
in
the
twilight
and
by
the
woods
ran
buffalo
run
ice
upon
the
shallows
to
either
bank
in
the
morning
when
the
artillery
was
up
when
breakfast
was
over
roll
called
orders
read
the
army
fell
to
the
duties
upon
which
paramount
stress
had
been
laid
all
the
farriers
the
drivers
the
men
who
had
to
do
with
horses
went
to
work
with
these
poor
wretched
lame
and
wounded
friends
feeding
them
currying
them
dressing
their
hurts
and
above
all
them
in
preparation
for
the
icy
mountains
ahead
the
clink
of
iron
against
iron
made
a
pleasant
sound
moreover
this
morning
the
sun
shone
very
cold
as
it
was
there
was
cheer
in
the
sky
even
the
crows
cawing
above
the
woods
did
not
sound
so
dolefully
a
thunder
run
man
found
a
tree
laden
with
shrivelled
persimmons
he
was
up
it
like
a
squirrel
simmon
tree
simmon
tree
comrades
came
hurrying
over
the
snow
the
fruit
was
dropped
into
upheld
caps
lifted
toward
eager
mouths
suddenly
there
flamed
a
generous
impulse
boys
them
poor
sick
fellows
with
nothing
but
hardtack
the
persimmons
were
carried
to
the
hospital
tents
before
the
sun
was
halfway
to
the
meridian
a
curious
spectacle
appeared
along
the
banks
of
buffalo
run
every
hundred
feet
or
so
was
built
a
large
fire
over
it
hung
a
camp
kettle
full
of
water
water
hot
as
the
fire
could
make
it
up
and
down
the
stream
an
improvised
laundry
went
into
operation
while
squad
by
squad
the
men
performed
their
personal
ablutions
it
was
the
eighth
of
january
they
had
left
winchester
upon
the
first
and
small
indeed
since
then
had
been
the
use
of
washing
water
in
the
dire
cold
with
the
streams
frozen
cleanliness
had
not
tempted
the
majority
and
indeed
latterly
the
men
had
been
too
worn
out
to
care
sleep
and
food
and
warmth
had
represented
the
sum
of
earthly
desire
a
number
with
ostentation
had
each
morning
broken
the
ice
from
some
pool
or
other
and
bathed
face
and
hands
but
few
extended
the
laved
area
the
general
order
appointing
a
washerman
day
came
none
too
soon
up
and
down
buffalo
run
in
the
zero
weather
the
men
stripped
and
bathed
soap
was
not
yet
the
scarce
and
valuable
commodity
it
was
to
become
there
was
soap
enough
for
all
and
the
camp
kettles
were
filled
from
the
stream
as
soon
as
emptied
underclothing
too
flannel
and
cotton
must
be
washed
there
came
discoveries
made
amid
ughs
of
disgust
the
more
fastidious
threw
the
whole
business
undergarment
and
parasites
into
the
fire
others
more
reasonable
or
without
a
change
of
clothing
scalded
their
apparel
with
anxious
care
the
episode
marked
a
stage
in
warfare
that
night
lieutenant
coffin
writing
a
letter
on
his
last
scrap
of
pale
blue
paper
sat
with
scrupulously
washed
hands
well
back
from
the
board
he
was
using
as
a
table
his
boyish
face
flushed
his
lips
quivered
as
he
wrote
he
wrote
of
lilies
and
moss
and
the
purity
of
women
and
he
said
there
was
a
side
of
war
which
walter
scott
had
never
painted
three
bleak
pinched
days
later
the
army
again
took
the
road
to
romney
four
miles
from
unger
they
began
to
climb
sleepy
creek
mountain
mounting
the
great
sparsely
wooded
slope
like
a
long
line
of
warrior
ants
to
either
hand
the
view
was
very
fine
north
mountain
to
the
left
capon
mountain
to
the
right
in
between
a
sea
of
hills
and
long
deep
vales
very
fine
and
utterly
unappreciated
the
earth
was
hostile
the
sky
was
hostile
the
commanding
general
was
hostile
snow
began
to
fall
allan
gold
marching
with
company
a
began
to
think
of
thunder
run
the
schoolhouse
and
the
tollgate
the
was
now
high
upon
the
and
the
view
had
vastly
widened
the
men
looked
out
and
over
toward
the
great
main
valley
of
virginia
and
they
looked
wistfully
to
many
of
the
men
home
was
over
there
home
wife
child
mother
all
hopelessly
out
of
reach
allan
gold
had
no
wife
nor
child
nor
mother
but
he
thought
of
sairy
and
tom
and
he
wondered
if
sairy
were
making
gingerbread
he
tried
to
smell
it
again
and
to
feel
the
warmth
of
her
kitchen
but
then
he
knew
too
well
that
she
was
not
making
gingerbread
tom
last
letter
had
spoken
of
the
growing
scarcity
flour
so
high
sugar
so
high
everybody
was
living
very
plainly
and
the
poor
were
going
to
suffer
allan
thought
of
the
schoolhouse
it
was
closed
he
could
see
just
how
it
looked
a
small
unused
building
mournful
deserted
crumbling
while
past
it
rushed
the
strong
and
wintry
torrent
he
thought
suddenly
of
christianna
he
saw
her
plainly
more
plainly
than
ever
he
had
done
before
she
looked
starved
defeated
he
thought
of
the
country
how
long
would
the
war
last
in
may
they
had
thought
three
months
in
the
flush
of
triumph
after
manassas
they
had
said
it
is
over
but
it
was
over
marching
and
camping
had
followed
fights
on
the
peninsula
fights
on
the
kanawha
at
leesburg
at
cheat
mountain
affairs
in
the
far
south
and
now
mcclellan
drilling
organizing
organizing
below
washington
with
rumours
of
another
on
to
richmond
when
would
the
war
be
over
allan
wondered
the
column
turning
to
the
right
began
to
descend
the
mountain
a
long
slipping
stumbling
downward
going
with
the
snow
falling
heavily
and
the
wind
screaming
like
a
banshee
at
the
foot
was
a
stretch
of
bottom
land
then
steep
and
rocky
grimly
waiting
to
be
crossed
rose
bear
garden
ridge
high
top
loomed
behind
the
infantry
could
see
the
cavalry
creeping
up
bear
garden
moving
slowly
slowly
bent
before
the
blast
through
the
falling
snow
from
far
in
the
rear
back
of
the
stonewall
brigade
back
of
loring
came
a
dull
sound
the
artillery
and
the
wagon
train
climbing
sleepy
creek
mountain
it
was
three
in
the
afternoon
oh
leaden
weariness
hunger
cold
sickness
shoes
back
upon
the
mountain
top
in
the
ambulance
taken
at
manassas
corbin
wood
better
than
he
had
been
for
several
days
but
still
feverish
propped
himself
upon
the
straw
and
smiled
across
at
will
cleave
who
half
carried
by
his
brother
had
appeared
beside
the
ambulance
an
hour
before
swaying
as
he
stood
the
boy
protested
to
the
last
that
he
could
march
just
as
well
as
the
other
fellows
that
they
would
think
him
a
baby
that
richard
would
ruin
his
reputation
that
he
was
giddy
that
the
doctor
in
winchester
had
told
him
that
after
you
got
well
from
typhoid
fever
you
were
stronger
than
you
ever
had
been
before
that
rat
would
think
he
was
malingering
that
that
that
richard
lifted
him
into
the
ambulance
and
laid
him
upon
the
straw
which
several
of
the
sick
pushed
forward
and
patted
into
place
the
surgeon
gave
a
restorative
the
elder
brother
waited
until
the
eyes
opened
stooped
and
kissed
him
on
the
forehead
and
went
away
now
will
said
that
he
was
rested
and
that
it
was
all
a
fuss
about
nothing
anyway
and
it
was
funny
travelling
like
animals
in
a
circus
and
it
most
feeding
time
anyway
corbin
wood
had
a
bit
of
bread
which
he
shared
and
two
or
three
convalescents
in
a
corner
took
up
the
circus
idea
there
ai
going
to
be
another
performance
this
year
we
going
into
winter
quarters

where

oh
hell
beg
your
pardon
sir
it
just
slipped
out
like
one
of
the
snake
charmer
rattlers
boys

of
a
real
circus
with
all
the
women
folk
an
the
tarletan
an
the
spangles
an
the
pink
lemonade
the
little
fellers
slipping
under

damned
clown
do
they
call
him
fool
tom
will
rose
from
the
straw
while
i
am
by
i
allow
no
man
to
reflect
upon
the
general
commanding
this
army
a
georgian
of
loring
tall
gaunt
parched
haggard
a
college
man
and
high
private
astray
from
his
own
brigade
rose
to
a
sitting
posture
what
in
hell
is
that
young
cockerel
crowing
about
is
it
about
the
damned
individual
at
the
head
of
this
army
i
take
it
that
it
is
then
i
will
answer
him
the
individual
at
the
head
of
this
army
is
not
a
general
he
is
a
schoolmaster
napoleon
or
caesar
or
marlborough
or
eugene
or
cromwell
or
turenne
or
frederick
would
turn
their
heads
to
look
at
him
as
they
passed
but
every
little
martinet
would
he
a
pedagogue
by
god
he
the
falerian
pedagogue
who
sold
his
pupils
to
the
romans
oh
the
pupils
trooping
after
him
through
flowers
and
sunshine
straight
into
the
hands
of
kelly
at
romney
with
rosecrans
and
twenty
thousand
just
beyond
yaaah
a
schoolmaster
leading
loring
and
all
of
us
let
him
go
back
to
lexington
and
teach
the
rule
of
three
for
by
god
he
never
demonstrate
the
rule
of
one
he
waved
a
hand
kindly
do
not
interrupt
stiff
fanatic
inhuman
callous
cold
half
mad
and
wholly
rash
without
military
capacity
ambitious
as
lucifer
and
absurd
as
hudibras
i
ask
again
what
is
this
person
doing
at
the
head
of
this
army
has
any
one
confidence
in
him
has
any
one
pride
in
him
has
any
one
love
for
him
in
all
this
frozen
waste
through
which
he
is
dragging
us
you
could
find
an
echo
to
say
oh
you
need
shout
you
not
an
echo
only
a
misguided
cadet
and
you
do
count
either
chaplain
with
all
respect
to
you
you
a
and
that
valley
man
over
there
he
does
count
either
he
belongs
to
the
stonewall
brigade
he
one
of
jackson
pet
lambs
favourites
all
they
got
to
do
is
to
cheer
for
their
hip
hip
hooray
here
old
jack
with
his
hand
lifted
and
his
old
cap
pulled
low
and
his
sabre
carried
and
his
has
been
very
good
to
us
men
yaaah
look
out
what
are
you
about
the
cadet
and
the
valley
man
threw
themselves
across
the
straw
upon
the
georgian
corbin
wood
crawled
over
and
separated
them
boys
boys
you
quarrelling
just
because
you
sick
and
tired
and
cold
and
fretful
try
to
be
good
children
i
predict
there
come
a
day
when
we
cheer
like
mad
our
friend
from
georgia
too
all
cheer
like
mad
when
general
jackson
goes
by
leading
us
to
victory
be
good
now
i
was
at
the
circus
once
when
i
was
a
little
boy
when
the
animals
got
to
fighting
the
way
over
bear
garden
was
steep
the
road
a
mere
track
among
boulders
there
were
many
fallen
trees
in
places
they
lay
across
the
road
abatis
thrown
there
by
the
storm
to
be
removed
by
hands
while
the
horses
stood
and
whinnied
the
winter
day
was
failing
when
stonewall
jackson
ashby
and
a
portion
of
the
cavalry
with
the
small
infantry
advance
came
down
by
precipitous
paths
into
bloomery
gap
here
in
a
dim
hollow
and
pass
of
the
mountains
beside
a
shallow
frozen
creek
they
bivouacked
from
the
other
side
of
bear
garden
general
loring
again
sent
stafford
forward
with
a
statement
couched
in
terms
of
courtesy
and
icy
the
aide
a
favourite
with
his
general
had
ventured
to
demur
i
do
think
general
jackson
likes
me
sir
would
not
some
other
loring
the
old
blizzard
of
two
years
later
had
sworn
damn
you
maury
whom
does
he
like
not
any
one
out
of
the
stonewall
brigade
you
got
a
limberer
wit
than
most
and
he
ca
make
you
cower
by
the
lord
i
seen
him
make
others
do
it
you
go
ahead
and
when
there
talk
indigo
presbyterian
there
was
a
space
of
trampled
snow
underneath
a
giant
pine
a
picket
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
stream
pointed
it
out
three
hundred
yards
away
a
dark
sentinel
towering
above
the
forest
he
thar
his
this
side
by
the
pawpaw
bushes
stafford
crossed
the
stream
shallow
and
filled
with
floating
ice
climbed
the
shelving
bank
and
coming
to
the
pawpaw
bushes
found
richard
cleave
stooping
over
the
small
flame
that
tullius
had
kindled
and
was
watchfully
feeding
with
pine
cones
cleave
straightened
himself
stafford
come
to
my
tiny
tiny
fire
i
ca
give
you
coffee
worse
luck
but
tullius
has
a
couple
of
sweet
potatoes
i
ca
stay
thank
you
said
the
other
general
jackson
is
over
yonder
yes
by
the
great
pine
i
will
take
you
to
him
the
two
stepped
from
out
the
ring
of
pawpaws
stafford
walking
leading
his
horse
general
loring
complains
again
has
he
not
reason
to
stafford
looked
about
him
ugh
steppes
of
russia
you
think
it
a
moscow
march
perhaps
it
is
but
i
doubt
if
ney
complained
you
think
that
we
complain
too
much
what
do
you
think
of
it
stafford
stood
still
they
were
beside
a
dark
line
of
cedars
skirting
the
forest
stretching
toward
the
great
pine
it
was
twilight
all
the
narrow
valley
drear
and
mournful
horses
and
men
like
phantoms
on
the
muffled
earth
i
think
said
stafford
deliberately
that
to
a
napoleon
general
loring
would
not
complain
nor
i
bear
his
message
of
complaint
but
to
general
jackson
we
will
in
the
interests
of
all
continue
to
make
representations
in
the
interests
of
all
exclaimed
cleave
i
beg
that
you
will
qualify
that
statement
garnett
brigade
and
ashby
cavalry
have
not
complained
no
many
disagreeable
duties
are
left
to
the
brigades
of
general
loring
i
challenge
that
statement
sir
it
is
not
true
stafford
laughed
not
true
you
will
not
get
us
to
believe
that
i
think
you
will
find
that
representations
will
be
forwarded
to
the
government
at
richmond
representations
of
disaffected
soldiers
no
sir
representations
of
gentlemen
and
patriots
remonstrances
of
brave
men
against
the
leadership
of
a
petty
tyrant
a
diseased
mind
a
presbyterian
deacon
crazed
for
personal
distinction
cleave
let
his
hand
fall
on
the
other
wrist
stop
sir
you
will
remember
that
i
am
of
garnett
brigade
and
at
present
of
general
jackson
military
family
stafford
jerked
his
wrist
away
he
breathed
hard
all
the
pent
weariness
irritation
wrath
of
the
past
most
wretched
days
all
the
chill
discomfort
of
the
hour
the
enmity
toward
cleave
of
which
he
was
increasingly
conscious
the
very
unsoundness
of
his
position
and
dissatisfaction
with
his
errand
pushed
him
on
quarrel
was
in
the
air
eight
thousand
men
had
found
their
temper
on
edge
it
was
not
surprising
that
between
these
two
a
flame
leaped
member
of
brigade
and
member
of
general
jackson
military
family
to
the
contrary
said
stafford
these
are
russian
steppes
and
this
is
a
march
from
moscow
and
the
general
in
command
is
no
napoleon
but
a
fool
and
a
pedant
i
give
you
warning
a
crazy
barebones
masquerading
as
a
cromwell
the
other
two
hands
on
the
shoulders
of
general
loring
aide
had
undoubtedly
the
weight
of
the
body
being
thrown
forward
the
appearance
of
an
assault
stafford
foot
slipped
upon
the
freezing
snow
down
he
came
to
the
earth
cleave
upon
him
a
voice
behind
them
spoke
with
a
kind
of
steely
curtness
stand
up
and
let
me
see
who
you
are
the
two
arose
and
faced
stonewall
jackson
he
had
come
upon
them
silently
out
from
the
screen
of
blackening
cedars
now
he
blocked
their
path
his
lips
iron
his
eyes
a
mere
gleaming
line
two
squabblers
rolling
in
the
snow
two
staff
officers
brawling
before
a
disheartened
army
what
have
you
to
say
for
yourselves
nothing
stafford
broke
the
silence
major
cleave
has
my
leave
to
explain
his
action
sir
jackson
eyes
drew
to
a
yet
narrower
line
your
leave
is
not
necessary
sir
what
was
this
brawl
about
major
cleave
we
quarrelled
sir
said
cleave
slowly
major
stafford
gave
utterance
to
certain
sentiments
with
which
i
did
not
agree
and
we
quarrelled
what
sentiments
yes
sir
i
order
you
to
answer
major
stafford
made
certain
statements
as
to
the
army
and
the
campaign
statements
which
i
begged
to
contradict
i
can
say
no
more
sir
you
will
tell
me
what
statements
major
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
do
that
sir
my
orders
are
always
possible
of
execution
sir
you
will
answer
me
cleave
kept
silence
the
twilight
settled
closer
the
dark
wall
of
the
cedars
seemed
to
advance
a
hollow
wind
blew
through
the
forest
why
i
will
tell
you
sir
said
stafford
impatiently
i
said
jackson
cut
him
short
be
silent
sir
i
have
not
asked
you
for
your
report
major
cleave
i
am
waiting
cleave
made
a
slight
gesture
sullen
weary
and
determined
i
am
very
sorry
sir
major
stafford
made
certain
comments
which
i
resented
hence
the
action
of
a
moment
that
is
all
that
i
can
say
sir
stafford
spoke
with
curt
rapidity
i
said
that
these
were
russian
steppes
and
that
this
was
a
march
from
moscow
but
that
we
had
not
a
napoleon
to
soften
privation
for
us
i
said
that
the
stonewall
brigade
was
unduly
favoured
that
the
general
commanding
was
he
got
no
further
silence
sir
said
jackson
or
i
will
bring
you
before
a
court
martial
you
will
come
with
me
now
to
my
tent
i
will
hear
general
loring
latest
communication
there
he
turned
upon
cleave
as
for
you
sir
you
will
consider
yourself
under
arrest
first
for
disobedience
of
orders
second
for
brawling
in
camp
you
will
march
in
the
rear
of
your
regiment
he
towered
a
moment
then
with
a
jerk
of
his
hand
went
away
taking
with
him
the
officer
from
loring
stafford
had
a
moment
in
which
to
make
a
gesture
of
anger
and
deprecation
a
gesture
which
the
other
acknowledged
with
a
nod
then
he
was
gone
looking
back
once
cleave
returned
to
tullius
and
the
small
fire
by
the
pawpaw
bushes
an
hour
later
when
his
regiment
came
down
into
bloomery
gap
he
found
the
colonel
and
made
his
report
why
damn
it
all
said
the
colonel
we
were
backing
you
for
the
brush
hunting
weather
and
a
clean
run
and
all
the
dogs
of
war
to
fawn
upon
you
at
the
end
and
here
a
paltry
hedge
and
a
bad
tumble
never
you
mind
you
pick
yourself
up
old
jack
likes
you
cleave
laughed
it
does
much
look
like
it
sir
well
i
back
with
the
regiment
anyway
all
that
night
it
snowed
snowed
hard
when
the
day
broke
the
valley
had
the
seeming
of
a
crowded
graveyard
numberless
white
mounds
stretching
north
and
south
in
the
feeble
light
a
bugle
blew
silver
chill
the
men
beneath
the
snow
stirred
moaned
arose
all
white
all
that
day
they
marched
and
at
dusk
crossed
the
capon
and
bivouacked
below
the
shoulder
of
sand
mountain
in
the
morning
they
went
up
the
mountain
the
road
was
deep
sand
intolerably
toilsome
the
column
ascended
in
long
curves
through
a
wood
of
oak
and
hickory
with
vast
tangles
of
grape
hanging
from
the
trees
cavalry
infantry
artillery
wagon
train
stragglers
the
army
came
slowly
slowly
down
sand
mountain
crossed
the
slender
levels
and
climbed
lovett
mountain
lovett
was
long
and
high
but
at
last
lovett
too
was
overpassed
the
column
crept
through
a
ravine
with
a
stream
to
the
left
grey
cliffs
appeared
fern
and
laurel
growing
in
the
clefts
below
lay
deep
snowdrifts
with
blue
shadows
ahead
overarching
the
road
appeared
a
grey
mass
that
all
but
choked
the
gorge
hanging
rock
quoth
some
one
that
where
the
guns
were
lost
the
army
woke
to
interest
hanging
rock
how
we
going
to
get
by
that
ai
a
road
it
just
a
cow
path
powerful
good
place
for
an
ambush
the
column
passed
the
rock
and
leaving
the
pass
came
into
open
country
before
the
leading
brigade
was
a
creek
an
old
covered
bridge
now
almost
burned
away
and
the
charred
ruin
of
a
house
by
the
roadside
lay
a
dead
cow
in
the
field
were
others
and
buzzards
were
circling
above
a
piece
of
woods
a
little
farther
a
dog
a
big
brown
shepherd
lay
in
the
middle
of
the
road
its
throat
had
been
cut
by
the
blackened
chimney
on
the
stone
hearth
drifted
over
by
the
snow
stood
a
child
cradle
nothing
living
was
to
be
seen
all
the
of
the
farm
and
the
barn
were
burned
it
was
the
beginning
of
a
track
of
desolation
from
hanging
rock
to
romney
the
confederate
column
traversed
a
country
where
kelly
troops
had
been
before
it
to
all
of
the
grey
rank
and
file
the
vision
came
with
strangeness
they
were
to
grow
used
to
such
sights
used
used
but
now
they
flamed
white
with
wrath
they
exclaimed
they
stammered
what
what
just
look
at
that
thar
tannery
they
slit
the
hides
to
ribbons
that
po
ole
white
horse
what
he
done
i
wonder
what
that
trampled
in
the
mud
that
a
doll
baby
o
lord
pick
it
up
tom
maybe
was
a
mill
once
but
wo
never
any
more
water
go
over
that
wheel
making
war
on
children
and
doll
babies
and
dumb
animals
and
mills
now
as
hereafter
the
immediate
effect
was
almost
that
of
warmth
and
rest
food
and
wine
suddenly
the
men
began
to
say
old
jack
wait
till
old
jack
gets
there
just
wait
till
old
jack
and
us
gets
there
i
reckon
there
be
something
doing
there
be
some
shooting
i
reckon
that
ai
practised
on
a
man
oxen
i
reckon
we
better
step
up
boys
naw
my
foot
do
hurt
no
more
a
mounted
officer
came
by
general
jackson
says
forward
men
the
men
did
their
best
it
was
very
cold
with
a
high
bitter
wind
another
low
mountain
presented
itself
the
road
edged
by
banks
of
purplish
slate
to
either
hand
great
stretches
of
dogwood
showing
scarlet
berries
or
sumach
lifting
torches
in
which
colour
yet
smouldered
the
column
came
down
a
steep
descent
crossed
a
creek
and
saw
before
it
jersey
mountain
jersey
mountain
proved
ghastly
long
high
bare
blown
against
by
all
the
winds
there
had
been
upon
jersey
a
few
cabins
a
smithy
a
mountain
school
now
there
were
only
blackened
chimneys
the
men
panted
as
they
climbed
the
wind
howled
along
the
crest
the
snow
began
to
swirl
at
a
turn
of
the
road
where
had
been
a
cabin
high
upon
the
bank
above
the
men
stood
a
mountain
woman
her
linsey
skirt
wrapped
about
her
by
the
wind
her
thick
pale
saxon
hair
lifted
and
carried
out
to
its
full
length
her
arms
raised
above
her
head
air
ye
going
against
them
air
ye
going
against
them
the
lightning
go
with
ye
and
the
fire
go
with
ye
and
the
hearts
of
your
mothers
go
with
ye
shoot
them
down
it
was
as
though
jersey
would
never
be
overpassed
there
grew
before
the
men
eyes
upon
the
treeless
plateau
which
marked
the
summit
a
small
country
church
and
graveyard
inexpressibly
lonely
they
looked
against
the
stormy
sky
lonely
and
beckoning
from
company
to
company
ran
a
statement
when
you
get
to
that
church
you
just
three
miles
from
romney
up
and
up
they
mounted
the
cavalry
and
advance
guard
seen
for
a
moment
against
a
level
horizon
disappeared
beyond
the
church
over
the
brink
of
the
hill
the
main
column
climbed
on
through
the
wind
and
the
snow
the
rear
came
far
behind
the
stonewall
brigade
led
the
main
body
as
it
reached
the
crest
of
jersey
a
horse
and
rider
a
courier
of
jackson
coming
from
the
west
met
it
rose
in
his
stirrups
and
shouted
the
damned
vandals
have
gone
the
yankees
have
gone
gotten
across
the
river
away
to
cumberland
you
were
quick
enough
general
jackson
says
god
you
are
too
slow
the
courier
even
in
his
anger
caught
himself
say
god
general
jackson
says
are
too
slow
they
gone
only
ashby
at
their
heels
they
left
their
stores
in
romney
but
they
gone
every
devil
of
them
by
god
general
jackson
says
should
have
marched
faster
he
was
gone
past
the
brigade
on
to
loring
with
his
tidings
the
stonewall
brigade
left
behind
the
graveyard
and
the
church
and
began
the
long
descent
at
first
a
great
flame
of
anger
kept
up
the
hearts
of
the
men
but
as
they
marched
as
they
toiled
down
jersey
as
the
realization
of
the
facts
pressed
upon
them
there
came
a
change
the
enemy
had
been
gone
from
bath
the
enemy
had
been
inaccessible
at
hancock
now
the
enemy
was
not
at
romney
cumberland
cumberland
was
many
a
wintry
mile
away
on
the
other
side
of
the
potomac
here
here
on
jersey
there
were
cold
hunger
weariness
sickness
clothing
grown
ragged
shoes
between
a
laugh
and
a
groan
the
snow
falling
the
wind
rising
the
day
declining
and
misery
flapping
dark
wings
above
the
head
of
the
army
of
the
northwest
over
the
troops
flowed
resistless
a
wave
of
reaction
nausea
disappointment
melancholy
the
step
changed
toward
the
foot
of
jersey
came
another
courier
yes
sir
on
toward
new
creek
general
jackson
says
forward
the
stonewall
brigade
tried
to
obey
and
somewhat
dismally
failed
how
could
it
quicken
step
again
night
was
coming
the
snow
was
falling
everybody
was
sick
at
heart
hobbling
limping
the
up
the
on
men
of
the
officers
thin
like
a
fretful
wail
was
taken
up
by
the
wind
and
lost
with
romney
well
in
sight
came
a
third
courier
general
jackson
says
forward
no
sir
he
did
say
anything
else
but
i
been
speaking
with
a
courier
of
ashby
says
there
are
three
railroad
bridges
one
across
patterson
creek
and
two
across
the
river
if
they
were
destroyed
the
enemy
communications
would
be
cut
he
thinks
we
headed
that
way
it
miles
the
other
side
of
romney
he
passed
down
the
column
general
jackson
says
forward
forward
press
forward
it
went
like
the
tolling
of
a
bell
on
and
on
toward
the
rear
past
the
stonewall
brigade
past
the
artillery
on
to
loring
yet
climbing
jersey
miles
beyond
romney
railroad
bridges
to
cut
frozen
creeks
frozen
rivers
steel
in
a
world
of
snow
kelly
probably
already
at
cumberland
and
rosecrans
beyond
at
wheeling
hunger
cold
winter
in
the
spurs
of
the
alleghenies
disease
stragglers
weariness
shoes
horses
disappointment
disillusion
a
very
very
strange
commanding
general
suddenly
confidence
heretofore
a
somewhat
limping
attendant
of
the
army
vanished
quite
away
the
shrill
derisive
wind
the
grey
wraiths
of
snow
the
dusk
of
the
mountains
took
her
conveyed
her
from

and
left
the

of
the

to
the
task
of
following

shaking
his
head
julius
left

miss

went

stood
before
the
portrait
of
her

unity
she
said
would
you
send
the
great
coffee
urn
to
richmond
for
the
gunboat
fair
or
would
you
send
lace
unity
pondered
the
question
the
lace
would
be
easier
to
send
but
maybe
they
would
rather
have
the
silver
i
do
see
who
is
to
buy
at
the
fair
every
one
is
oh
i
wish
we
had
a
thousand
gunboats
and
a
hundred
a
door
banged
in
the
distance
and
the
windows
of
the

rattled
the

darker
i
knew
we
should
have
a
storm

miss
lucy

judith
came
in
suddenly
there
going
to
be
a
great
storm
the
wind
is
blowing
the
elms
almost
to
the
ground
there
are
black
clouds
in
the
east
i
hope
that
there
are
clouds
over
the
ocean
and
over
chesapeake
and
over
hampton
roads
except
where
the
merrimac
lies
i
hope
that
there
it
is
still
and
sunny
clouds

wind

stood
a

on

side
of
the

frame
facing
the
darkened
sky
and
the

behind

in

touching
the

her
dark
eyes
upon

bending
oaks

of
their

gone
down

unity
came
and
stood
beside

the
oaks
outside
like
the
elms
at
the
back
of

moving

low
down

the

the

showed
in

the

a

jarred
the

you
were

her

looked
at

with

it

i
follow
all
the

i
follow
with
my

the
troops
upon
the
march
and
the
ships
on
the

i
do
not
hate
the
ships
they
are
beautiful
with
the
green
waves
about
them
and
the
with
shining
wings
and
yet
i
wish
that
they
would
sink
down
down
quickly
before
there
was
much
suffering
before
the
men
on
them
had
time
for
thought
they
should
go
like
a
stone
to
the
bottom
without
suffering
and
they
should
lie
there
peacefully
until
their
spirits
are
called
again
and
our
ports
should
be
open
and
less
blood
would
be
shed
less
blood
less

edward
edward
edward
darling
came
down
clean
faintly
perfumed
shaven
thin
extremely
handsome
and
debonair
supper
went
off
beautifully
with
the
last
of
the
coffee
poured
from
the
urn
that
had
not
yet
gone
to
the
gunboat
fair
with
the
greenwood
ladies
dressed
in
the
best
of
their
last
year
gowns
with
flowers
in
judith
hair
and
at
unity
throat
with
a
reckless
use
of
candles
with
julius
and
tom
the
boy
duskily
smiling
in
the
background
with
the
spring
rain
beating
against
the
panes
with
the
burning
on
the
hearth
with
churchill
and
cary
and
dandridge
portraits
now
in
shadow
now
in
gleam
upon
the
walls
with
all
the
cheer
the
light
the
gracious
warmth
of
home
none
of
the
women
spoke
of
how
seldom
they
burned
candles
now
of
how
the
coffee
had
been
saved
against
an
emergency
and
of
the
luxury
white
bread
was
becoming
they
ignored
too
the
troubles
of
the
plantation
they
would
not
trouble
their
soldier
with
the
growing
difficulty
of
finding
food
for
the
servants
and
for
the
stock
of
the
plough
horses
gone
and
no
seed
for
the
sowing
of
the
problem
it
was
to
clothe
the
men
women
and
children
with
osnaburgh
at
cents
a
yard
with
the
difficulties
of
healing
the
sick
medicine
having
been
declared
contraband
of
war
and
the
home
supply
failing
they
would
not
trouble
him
with
the
makeshifts
of
women
their
forebodings
as
to
shoes
as
to
letter
paper
their
windings
here
and
there
through
a
maze
of
difficulties
strange
to
them
as
a
landscape
of
the
moon
they
would
learn
and
it
was
but
little
harder
than
being
in
the
field
not
that
they
thought
of
it
in
that
light
they
thought
the
field
as
much
harder
as
it
was
more
glorious
nothing
was
too
good
for
their
soldier
they
would
have
starved
a
week
to
have
given
him
the
white
bread
the
loaf
sugar
and
the
mocha
supper
over
he
went
down
to
the
house
quarter
to
speak
to
the
men
and
women
there
then
in
the
parlour
at
the
piano
he
played
with
his
masterly
touch
the
last
waltz
and
then
he
came
to
the
fire
took
his
grandfather
chair
and
described
to
the
women
the
battle
at
sea
we
were
encamped
on
the
warwick
river
infantry
and
a
cavalry
company
and
a
battalion
from
new
orleans
around
us
were
green
flats
black
mud
winding
creeks
waterfowl
earthworks
and
what
guns
they
could
give
us
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
across
the
channel
we
had
sunk
twenty
canal
boats
to
the
end
that
burnside
should
not
get
by
besides
the
canal
boats
and
the
guns
and
the
waterfowl
there
was
a
deal
of
fever
malarial
of
exposure
of
wet
of
mouldy
bread
of
homesickness
and
general
desolation
some
courage
existed
too
and
singing
at
times
we
had
been
down
there
a
long
time
among
the
marshes
all
winter
in
fact
about
two
weeks
ago
oh
edward
were
you
very
homesick
devilish
for
the
certain
production
of
a
very
curious
feeling
give
me
picket
duty
on
a
wet
marsh
underneath
the
stars
poetic
places
marshes
with
a
strong
suggestion
about
them
of
the
last
man
where
was
i
down
to
our
camp
one
morning
about
two
weeks
ago
came
el
capitan
colorado
general
magruder
you
know
gold
lace
stars
and
black
plume
with
him
came
lieutenant
wood
we
were
paraded
edward
try
as
i
may
i
can
not
get
over
the
strangeness
of
your
being
in
the
ranks
edward
laughed
there
many
a
better
man
than
i
in
them
aunt
lucy
they
make
the
best
of
from
which
to
spy
on
life
and
that
is
what
i
always
wanted
to
do
to
spy
on
life
the
men
were
paraded
and
lieutenant
wood
made
us
a
speech
old
merrimac
you
know
men
that
was
burnt
last
year
when
the
yankees
left
norfolk
well
raised
her
and
cut
her
down
to
her
berth
deck
and
made
of
her
what
we
call
an
an
is
a
new
that
going
to
take
the
place
of
the
old
the
merrimac
is
not
a
frigate
any
longer
the
virginia
and
we
rather
think
she
going
to
make
her
name
remembered
she
over
there
at
the
gosport
navy
yard
and
she
almost
ready
she
covered
over
with
iron
plates
and
she
got
an
iron
beak
or
ram
and
she
carries
ten
guns
on
the
whole
she
the
ugliest
beauty
that
you
ever
saw
she
almost
ready
to
send
to
davy
jones
locker
a
yankee
ship
or
two
commodore
buchanan
commands
her
and
you
know
who
he
is
she
got
her
full
quota
of
officers
and
the
speaker
excepted
they
as
fine
a
set
as
you
find
on
the
high
seas
but
men
are
scarcer
my
friends
than
hen
teeth
it
what
comes
of
having
no
maritime
population
every
man
jack
that
is
on
our
few
little
ships
is
in
the
army
and
the
virginia
wants
a
crew
of
three
hundred
of
the
bravest
of
the
brave
now
i
am
talking
to
virginians
and
louisianians
many
of
you
are
from
new
orleans
and
that
means
that
some
of
you
may
very
well
have
been
seamen
seamen
at
an
emergency
anyhow
anyhow
when
it
comes
to
an
emergency
virginians
and
louisianians
are
there
to
meet
it
on
sea
or
on
land
just
now
there
is
an
emergency
the
virginia
got
to
have
a
crew
general
magruder
for
all
he
got
only
a
small
force
with
which
to
hold
a
long
line
general
magruder
like
the
patriot
that
he
is
has
said
that
i
may
ask
this
morning
for
volunteers
men
any
seaman
among
you
has
the
chance
to
gather
laurels
from
the
strangest
deck
of
the
strangest
ship
that
ever
you
saw
no
fear
for
the
laurels
they
fresh
and
green
even
under
our
belching
smokestack
the
merrimac
is
up
like
the
phoenix
and
the
last
state
of
her
is
greater
than
the
first
and
her
name
is
going
down
in
history
louisianians
and
virginians
who
volunteers
about
two
hundred
volunteered
edward
what
did
you
know
about
seamanship
precious
little
chiefly
unity
what
you
have
read
to
me
from
novels
but
the
laurels
sounded
enticing
and
i
was
curious
about
the
ship
well
wood
chose
about
eighty
all
who
had
been
seamen
or
gunners
and
a
baker
dozen
of
ignoramuses
beside
i
came
in
with
that
portion
of
the
elect
and
off
we
went
in
boats
across
the
james
to
the
southern
shore
and
to
the
gosport
navy
yard
that
was
a
week
before
the
battle
what
does
it
look
like
edward
the
merrimac
it
looks
judith
like
hamlet
cloud
sometimes
there
is
an
appearance
of
a
barn
with
everything
but
the
roof
submerged
or
of
noah
ark
three
fourths
under
water
sometimes
when
the
flag
is
flying
she
has
the
air
of
a
piece
of
earthworks
mysteriously
floated
off
into
the
river
ordinarily
though
she
is
rather
like
a
turtle
with
a
chimney
sticking
up
from
her
shell
the
shell
is
made
of
pitch
pine
and
oak
and
it
is
covered
with
thick
plates
of
tredegar
iron
the
beak
is
of
cast
iron
standing
four
feet
out
from
the
bow
that
with
the
rest
of
the
old
berth
deck
is
just
awash
both
ends
of
the
shell
are
rounded
for
pivot
guns
over
the
gun
deck
is
an
iron
grating
on
which
you
can
walk
at
need
there
is
the
covered
with
iron
and
there
is
the
smokestack
below
are
the
engines
and
boilers
condemned
after
the
merrimac
last
cruise
and
since
then
lying
in
the
ooze
at
the
bottom
of
the
river
they
are
very
wheezy
trembling
poor
old
men
of
the
sea
it
was
hard
work
to
get
the
coal
for
them
to
eat
it
was
brought
at
last
from
away
out
in
montgomery
county
from
the
price
the
guns
are
two
rifles
two
rifles
and
six
smoothbores
ten
in
yes
call
her
a
turtle
plated
with
iron
she
looks
as
much
like
that
as
like
anything
else
when
we
eighty
men
from
the
warwick
first
saw
her
she
was
swarming
with
workmen
they
continued
to
cover
her
over
and
to
make
impossible
any
drill
or
exercise
upon
her
hammer
hammer
upon
belated
plates
from
the
tredegar
tinker
tinker
with
the
poor
old
engines
make
shift
here
and
make
shift
there
work
through
the
day
and
work
through
the
night
for
there
was
a
rumour
abroad
that
the
ericsson
that
we
knew
was
building
was
coming
down
the
coast
there
was
no
chance
to
drill
to
become
acquainted
with
the
turtle
and
her
temperament
her
species
had
never
gone
to
war
before
and
when
you
looked
at
her
there
was
room
for
doubt
as
to
how
she
would
behave
officers
and
men
were
strange
to
one
another
and
the
gunners
could
not
try
the
guns
for
the
swarming
workmen
there
was
so
much
of
the
montgomery
coal
that
it
could
be
wasted
on
experiments
in
firing
up
and
indeed
it
seemed
wise
not
to
experiment
at
all
with
the
ancient
engines
so
we
stood
about
the
navy
yard
and
looked
down
the
elizabeth
and
across
the
flats
to
hampton
roads
where
we
could
see
the
cumberland
the
congress
and
the
minnesota
federal
ships
lying
off
newport
news
and
the
workmen
rivetted
the
last
plates
and
smoke
began
to
come
out
of
the
smokestack
and
suddenly
commodore
buchanan
with
his
lieutenants
behind
him
appeared
between
us
and
the
merrimac
or
the
virginia
most
of
us
still
call
her
the
merrimac
it
was
the
morning
of
the
eighth
the
sun
shone
brightly
and
the
water
was
very
blue
blue
and
still
there
were
i
remember
flying
overhead
screaming
as
they
flew
and
the
marshes
were
growing
emerald
yes
yes
what
did
commodore
buchanan
want
do
be
impatient
molly
you
women
do
in
the
least
look
like
griseldas
aunt
lucy
has
the
air
of
her
pioneer
who
has
heard
an
indian
calling
and
as
for
judith
judith
yes
edward
come
back
to
greenwood
you
looked
a
listening
jeanne
what
did
you
hear
i
heard
the
engines
working
and
the
sea
fowl
screaming
and
the
wind
in
the
rigging
of
the
cumberland
go
on
edward
we
soldiers
turned
seamen
came
to
attention
on
board
men
said
commodore
buchanan
are
going
out
in
the
roads
and
introduce
a
new
era
so
off
the
workmen
came
and
on
we
went
the
flag
officers
and
the
lieutenants
and
the
midshipmen
and
the
surgeons
and
the
volunteer
aides
and
the
men
the
engineers
were
already
below
and
the
gunners
were
looking
at
the
guns
the
smoke
rolled
up
very
black
the
ropes
were
cast
off
a
bugle
blew
out
streamed
the
stars
and
bars
all
the
workmen
on
the
dock
swung
their
hats
and
down
the
elizabeth
moved
the
merrimac
she
moved
slowly
enough
with
her
poor
old
engines
and
she
steered
badly
and
she
drew
feet
and
she
was
ugly
ugly
ugly
poor
thing
now
we
were
opposite
craney
island
at
the
mouth
of
the
elizabeth
there
a
battery
there
you
know
part
of
general
colston
line
and
there
are
forts
upon
the
main
along
the
james
all
these
were
now
crowded
with
men
hurrahing
waving
their
caps
as
we
passed
craney
they
were
singing
so
we
came
out
into
the
james
to
hampton
roads
now
all
the
southern
shore
from
willoughby
spit
to
ragged
island
is
as
grey
as
a
dove
and
all
the
northern
shore
from
old
point
comfort
to
newport
news
is
blue
where
the
enemy
has
settled
in
between
are
the
shining
roads
between
the
rip
raps
and
old
point
swung
at
anchor
the
roanoke
the
saint
lawrence
a
number
of
gunboats
store
ships
and
transports
and
also
a
french
far
and
near
over
the
roads
were
many
small
craft
the
minnesota
a
large
ship
lay
halfway
between
old
point
and
newport
news
at
the
latter
place
there
is
a
large
federal
garrison
and
almost
in
the
shadow
of
its
batteries
rode
at
anchor
the
frigate
congress
and
the
sloop
cumberland
the
first
had
fifty
guns
the
second
thirty
the
virginia
or
the
merrimac
or
the
turtle
creeping
out
from
the
elizabeth
crept
slowly
and
puffing
black
smoke
into
the
south
channel
the
pilot
in
his
no
bigger
than
a
hickory
nut
put
her
head
to
the
northwest
the
turtle
began
to
swim
toward
newport
news
until
now
not
a
few
of
us
within
her
shell
and
almost
all
of
the
soldiers
and
the
forts
along
the
shore
had
thought
her
upon
a
trial
trip
only
down
the
elizabeth
past
craney
island
turn
at
point
and
back
to
the
dock
of
the
gosport
navy
yard
when
she
did
not
turn
the
cheering
on
the
shore
stopped
you
felt
the
breathlessness
when
she
passed
the
point
and
took
to
the
south
channel
when
her
head
turned
upstream
when
she
came
abreast
of
the
middle
ground
when
they
saw
that
the
turtle
was
going
to
fight
from
along
the
shore
to
craney
and
from
sewell
point
there
arose
a
yell
every
man
in
grey
yelled
they
swung
hat
or
cap
they
shouted
themselves
hoarse
all
the
flags
streamed
suddenly
out
trumpets
blared
the
sky
lifted
and
we
drank
the
sunshine
in
like
wine
that
is
some
of
us
did
to
others
it
came
cold
like
hemlock
against
the
lip
fear
is
a
horrible
sensation
i
was
dreadfully
afraid
edward
dreadfully
but
you
see
i
did
tell
any
one
i
was
afraid
and
that
makes
all
the
difference
besides
it
wore
off
it
was
a
spring
day
and
high
tide
and
the
federal
works
at
newport
news
and
the
congress
and
the
cumberland
and
the
more
distant
minnesota
all
looked
asleep
in
the
calm
sweet
weather
washing
day
it
was
on
the
congress
and
clothes
were
drying
in
the
rigging
that
aspect
as
of
painted
ships
painted
breastworks
a
painted
lasted
until
the
turtle
reached
then
the
other
side
woke
up
upon
the
shore
appeared
a
blue
swarm
men
running
to
and
fro
bugles
signalled
a
commotion
too
arose
upon
the
congress
and
the
cumberland
her
head
toward
the
latter
ship
the
turtle
puffed
forth
black
smoke
and
wallowed
across
the
channel
an
uglier
poor
thing
you
never
saw
nor
a
bolder
squat
to
the
water
belching
black
smoke
her
engines
wheezing
and
repining
unwieldy
of
management
her
bottom
scraping
every
hummock
of
sand
in
all
the
shoaly
roads
ah
she
was
ugly
and
courageous
our
two
small
gunboats
the
raleigh
and
the
beaufort
coming
from
norfolk
now
overtook
us
we
went
on
together
i
was
forward
with
the
crew
of
the
pivot
gun
i
could
see
through
the
port
above
the
muzzle
officers
and
men
we
were
all
cooped
under
the
turtle
shell
in
order
by
the
open
ports
and
the
guns
all
ready
we
came
to
within
a
mile
of
the
cumberland
tall
and
graceful
with
her
masts
and
spars
and
all
the
blue
sky
above
she
looked
a
swan
and
we
the
ugly
duckling
our
ram
you
know
was
under
water
seventy
feet
of
the
old
berth
deck
ending
in
a
beak
of
cast
iron
we
came
nearer
at
three
quarters
of
a
mile
we
opened
with
the
bow
gun
the
cumberland
answered
and
the
congress
and
their
gunboats
and
shore
batteries
then
began
a
frightful
uproar
that
shook
the
marshes
and
sent
the
sea
birds
screaming
smoke
arose
and
flashing
fire
and
an
excitement
an
excitement
an
then
it
was
ladies
that
i
forgot
to
be
afraid
the
turtle
swam
on
toward
the
cumberland
swimming
as
fast
as
montgomery
coal
and
the
engines
that
had
lain
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
could
make
her
go
there
was
a
frightful
noise
within
her
shell
a
humming
a
shaking
the
congress
the
gunboats
and
the
shore
batteries
kept
firing
broadsides
there
was
an
enormous
thundering
noise
and
the
air
was
grown
sulphurous
cloud
their
shot
came
pattering
like
hail
and
like
hail
it
rebounded
from
the
we
passed
the
congress
very
close
to
her
tall
side
she
gave
us
a
withering
fire
we
returned
it
and
steered
on
for
the
cumberland
a
word
ran
from
end
to
end
of
the
turtle
shell
are
going
to
ram
her
stand
by
men
within
easy
range
we
fired
the
pivot
gun
i
was
of
her
crew
half
naked
we
were
and
streaming
with
sweat
the
shell
she
sent
burst
above
the
cumberland
stern
pivot
killing
or
wounding
most
of
her
crew
that
served
it
we
went
on
through
the
port
i
could
now
see
the
cumberland
plainly
her
starboard
side
just
ahead
of
us
men
in
the
shrouds
and
running
to
and
fro
on
her
deck
when
we
were
all
but
on
her
her
starboard
blazed
that
broadside
tore
up
the
carriage
of
our
pivot
gun
cut
another
off
at
the
trunnions
and
the
muzzle
from
a
third
riddled
the
smokestack
and
carried
away
an
anchor
and
killed
or
wounded
nineteen
men
the
virginia
answered
with
three
guns
a
cloud
of
smoke
came
between
the
and
the
armed
sloop
it
lifted
and
we
were
on
her
we
struck
her
under
the
fore
rigging
with
a
dull
and
grinding
sound
the
iron
beak
with
which
we
were
armed
was
wrested
off
the
virginia
shivered
hung
a
moment
then
backed
clear
of
the
cumberland
in
whose
side
there
was
now
a
ragged
and
a
gaping
hole
the
pilot
in
the
turned
her
head
upstream
the
water
was
shoal
she
had
to
run
up
the
james
some
way
before
she
could
turn
and
come
back
to
attack
the
congress
her
keel
was
in
the
mud
she
was
creeping
now
like
a
land
turtle
and
all
the
iron
shore
was
firing
at
her
she
turned
at
last
in
freer
water
and
came
down
the
roads
through
the
port
we
could
see
the
cumberland
that
we
had
rammed
she
had
listed
to
port
and
was
sinking
the
water
had
reached
her
main
deck
all
her
men
were
now
on
the
spar
deck
where
they
yet
served
the
pivot
guns
she
fought
to
the
last
a
man
of
ours
stepping
for
one
moment
through
a
port
to
the
outside
of
the
turtle
shell
was
cut
in
two
as
the
water
rose
and
rose
the
sound
of
her
guns
was
like
a
lessening
thunder
one
by
one
they
stopped
to
the
last
she
flew
her
colours
the
cumberland
went
down
by
now
there
had
joined
us
the
small
small
james
river
squadron
that
had
been
anchored
far
up
the
river
the
patrick
henry
had
twelve
guns
the
jamestown
had
two
and
the
teaser
one
down
they
scurried
like
three
valiant
marsh
hens
to
aid
the
turtle
with
the
beaufort
and
the
raleigh
there
were
five
valiant
pygmies
and
they
fired
at
the
shore
batteries
and
the
shore
batteries
answered
like
an
angry
jove
with
solid
shot
with
shell
with
grape
and
with
canister
a
shot
wrecked
the
boiler
of
the
patrick
henry
scalding
to
death
the
men
who
were
near
the
turtle
sank
a
transport
steamer
lying
alongside
the
wharf
at
newport
news
and
then
she
rounded
the
point
and
bore
down
upon
the
congress
the
frigate
had
showed
discretion
which
is
the
better
part
of
valour
noting
how
deeply
we
drew
she
had
slipped
her
cables
and
run
aground
in
the
shallows
where
she
was
safe
from
the
ram
of
the
merrimac
we
could
get
no
nearer
than
two
hundred
feet
there
we
took
up
position
and
there
we
began
to
rake
her
the
beaufort
the
raleigh
and
the
jamestown
giving
us
what
aid
they
might
she
had
fifty
guns
and
there
were
the
heavy
shore
batteries
and
below
her
the
minnesota
this
ship
also
aground
in
the
middle
channel
now
came
into
action
with
a
roar
a
hundred
guns
were
trained
upon
the
merrimac
the
iron
hail
beat
down
every
point
not
that
showed
above
our
shell
the
muzzle
of
two
guns
were
shot
away
the
stanchions
the
boat
davits
the
flagstaff
again
and
again
the
flagstaff
fell
and
again
and
again
we
replaced
it
at
last
we
tied
the
colours
to
the
smokestack
beside
the
nineteen
poor
fellows
that
the
cumberland
guns
had
mowed
down
we
now
had
other
killed
and
wounded
commodore
buchanan
was
badly
hurt
and
the
flag
lieutenant
minor
the
hundred
guns
thundered
against
the
merrimac
and
the
merrimac
thundered
against
the
congress
the
tall
frigate
and
her
fifty
guns
wished
herself
an
the
swan
would
have
blithely
changed
with
the
ugly
duckling
we
brought
down
her
mainmast
we
disabled
her
guns
we
strewed
her
decks
with
blood
and
anguish
war
is
a
wild
beast
nothing
more
and
i
hail
the
day
when
it
lies
slain
we
smashed
in
her
sides
and
we
set
her
afire
she
hauled
down
her
colours
and
ran
up
a
white
flag
the
merrimac
ceased
firing
and
signalled
to
the
beaufort
the
beaufort
ran
alongside
and
the
frigate
ranking
officer
gave
up
his
colours
and
his
sword
the
beaufort
and
the
congress
own
boats
removed
the
crew
and
the
wounded
the
shore
batteries
the
minnesota
the
picket
boat
zouave
kept
up
a
heavy
firing
all
the
while
upon
the
merrimac
upon
the
raleigh
and
the
jamestown
and
also
upon
the
beaufort
we
waited
until
the
crew
was
clear
of
the
congress
and
then
we
gave
her
a
round
of
hot
shot
that
presently
set
her
afire
from
stem
to
stern
this
done
we
turned
to
other
work
the
minnesota
lay
aground
in
the
north
channel
to
her
aid
hurrying
up
from
old
point
came
the
roanoke
and
the
saint
lawrence
our
own
batteries
at
sewell
point
opened
upon
these
two
ships
as
they
passed
and
they
answered
with
broadsides
we
fed
our
engines
and
under
a
billow
of
black
smoke
ran
down
to
the
minnesota
like
the
congress
she
lay
upon
a
sand
bar
beyond
fear
of
ramming
we
could
only
manoeuvre
for
deep
water
near
enough
to
her
to
be
deadly
it
was
now
late
afternoon
i
could
see
through
the
port
of
the
bow
pivot
the
slant
sunlight
upon
the
water
and
how
the
blue
of
the
sky
was
paling
the
minnesota
lay
just
ahead
very
tall
she
looked
another
of
the
congress
breed
the
old
warships
singing
their
death
song
as
we
came
on
we
fired
the
bow
gun
then
lying
nearer
her
began
with
broadsides
but
we
could
not
get
near
enough
she
was
lifted
high
upon
the
sand
the
tide
was
going
out
and
we
drew
feet
we
did
her
great
harm
but
we
were
not
disabling
her
an
hour
passed
and
the
sun
drew
on
to
setting
the
roanoke
turned
and
went
back
under
the
guns
of
old
point
but
the
saint
lawrence
remained
to
thunder
at
the
turtle
iron
shell
the
merrimac
was
most
unhandy
and
on
the
ebb
tide
there
would
be
shoals
enough
between
us
and
a
berth
for
the
night
the
minnesota
could
not
get
away
at
dawn
she
would
be
yet
aground
and
we
would
then
take
her
for
our
prize
till
dusk
and
the
blessed
old
iron
box
will
ground
herself
where
noah
flood
wo
float
her
the
pilot
ruled
and
in
the
gold
and
purple
sunset
we
drew
off
as
we
passed
the
minnesota
blazed
with
all
her
guns
we
answered
her
and
answered
too
the
saint
lawrence
the
evening
star
was
shining
when
we
anchored
off
point
the
wounded
were
taken
ashore
for
we
had
no
place
for
wounded
men
under
the
turtle
shell
commodore
buchanan
leaving
us
lieutenant
catesby
ap
rice
jones
took
command
i
do
not
remember
what
we
had
for
supper
we
had
not
eaten
since
early
morning
so
we
must
have
had
something
but
we
were
too
tired
to
think
or
to
reason
or
to
remember
we
dropped
beside
our
guns
and
slept
but
not
for
long
three
hours
perhaps
we
slept
and
then
a
whisper
seemed
to
run
through
the
merrimac
it
was
as
though
the
herself
had
spoken
watch
the
congress
die
most
of
us
arose
from
beside
the
guns
and
mounted
to
the
iron
grating
above
to
the
top
of
the
shell
it
was
a
night
as
soft
as
silk
the
water
smooth
in
long
faint
olive
swells
a
in
the
sky
there
were
lights
across
at
old
point
lights
on
the
battery
at
the
rip
raps
lights
in
the
frightened
shipping
huddled
under
the
guns
of
fortress
monroe
lights
along
either
shore
there
were
lanterns
in
the
rigging
of
the
minnesota
where
she
lay
upon
the
sand
bar
and
lanterns
on
the
saint
lawrence
and
the
roanoke
as
we
looked
a
small
moving

want
to
look
at
the
congress
four
miles
away
off
newport
news
lay
the
burning
congress
in
the
still
clear
night
she
seemed
almost
at
hand
all
her
masts
her
spars
and
her
rigging
showed
black
in
the
heart
of
a
great
ring
of
firelight
her
hull
lifted
high
by
the
sand
bank
which
held
her
had
round
red
eyes
her
ports
were
windows
lit
from
within
she
made
a
vision
of
beauty
and
of
horror
one
by
one
as
they
were
reached
by
the
flame
her
guns
exploded
a
loud
and
awful
sound
in
the
night
above
the
roads
we
stood
and
watched
that
sea
picture
and
we
watched
in
silence
we
are
seeing
giant
things
and
ere
this
war
is
ended
we
shall
see
more
at
two
in
the
morning
the
fire
reached
her
powder
magazine
she
blew
up
a
column
like
the
israelite
pillar
shot
to
the
zenith
there
came
an
earthquake
sound
sullen
and
deep
when
all
cleared
there
was
only
her
hull
upborne
by
the
sand
and
still
burning
it
burned
until
the
dawn
when
it
smouldered
and
went
out
the
narrator
arose
walked
the
length
of
the
parlour
and
came
back
to
the
four
women
have
you
had
enough
for
unity
looks
sleepy
and
judith
knitting

lain
this
on

judith
says
that
if
there
is
fighting
around
richmond
she
is
going
there
to
the
hospitals
to
be
a
nurse
the
doctors
here
say
that
she
does
better
than

go
on
edward
said
judith
what
happened
at
dawn
we
got
the
turtle
in
order
and
those
ancient
mariners
our
engines
began
to
work
wheezing
and
slow
we
ran
up
a
new
flagstaff
and
every
man
stood
to
the
guns
and
the
merrimac
moved
from
sewell
point
her
head
turned
to
the
minnesota
away
across
grounded
on
a
sand
bank
in
the
north
channel
the
sky
was
as
pink
as
the
inside
of
a
shell
and
a
thin
white
mist
hung
over
the
marshes
and
the
shore
and
the
great
stretch
of
hampton
roads
it
was
so
thin
that
the
masts
of
the
ships
huddled
below
fortress
monroe
rose
clear
of
it
into
the
flush
of
the
coming
sun
all
their
pennants
were
flying
the
french
and
the
northern
ships
at
that
hour
the
are
abroad
searching
for
their
food
they
went
past
the
ports
screaming
and
moving
their
silver
wings
the
minnesota
grew
in
size
every
man
of
us
looked
eagerly
from
the
from
the
bow
ports
and
as
we
drew
parallel
with
her
from
the
ports
of
the
side
we
fired
the
bow
gun
as
we
came
on
and
the
shot
told
there
was
some
cheering
the
morning
air
was
so
fine
and
the
prize
so
sure
the
turtle
was
in
spirits
poor
old
turtle
with
her
battered
shell
and
her
flag
put
back
as
fast
as
it
was
torn
away
her
engines
this
morning
were
mortal
slow
and
weak
they
wheezed
and
whined
and
she
drew
so
deep
that
in
that
shoaly
water
she
went
aground
twice
between
sewell
point
and
the
stretch
she
had
now
reached
of
smooth
pink
water
with
the
dipping
between
her
and
the
minnesota
despite
the
engines
she
was
happy
and
the
gunners
were
all
ready
at
the
starboard
ports
leaning
over
he
took
the
poker
and
stirred
the
fire
the
best
laid
plans
of
mice
and

gang
agley
miss
lucy
needles
clicked
yes
the
papers
told
us
the
ericsson
there
came
said
edward
there
came
from
behind
the
minnesota
a
on
a
shingle
it
had
lain
there
hidden
by
her
bulk
since
midnight
it
was
its
single
light
that
we
had
watched
and
thought
no
more
of
a
on
a
shingle
and
now
it
darted
into
the
open
as
though
a
boy
arm
had
sent
it
it
was
little
beside
the
minnesota
it
was
little
even
beside
the
turtle
there
was
a
silence
when
we
saw
it
a
silence
of
astonishment
it
had
come
so
quietly
upon
the
scene
a
ex
indeed
dropped
from
the
clouds
between
us
and
our
prey
in
a
moment
we
knew
it
for
the
ericsson
the
other
we
knew
to
be
the
monitor
they
call
it
the
shingle
was
just
awash
the
turned
out
to
be
a
revolving
turret
and
carrying
two
large
modern
guns
the
whole
thing
was
armoured
had
the
best
of
engines
and
drew
only
twelve
feet
well
the
merrimac
had
a
startled
breath
to
be
sure
there
is
no
denying
the
drama
of
the
monitor
appearance
and
then
she
righted
and
began
firing
she
gave
to
the
or
to
the
armoured
turret
one
after
the
other
three
broadsides
the
turret
blazed
and
answered
and
the
balls
rebounded
from
each
armoured
champion
he
laughed
by
heaven
it
was
like
our
old
favourites
ivanhoe
and
de
bois
guilbert
the
ugliest
squat
gnomes
of
an
ivanhoe
and
of
a
brian
de
bois
guilbert
that
ever
came
out
of
a
nightmare
we
thundered
in
the
lists
and
then
we
passed
each
other
turned
and
again
encountered
sometimes
we
were
a
long
way
apart
and
sometimes
there
was
not
ten
feet
of
water
between
those
sunken
decks
from
which
arose
the
iron
shell
of
the
merrimac
and
the
iron
turret
of
the
monitor
she
fired
every
seven
minutes
we
as
rapidly
as
we
could
load
now
it
was
the
bow
gun
now
the
after
pivot
now
a
full
broadside
once
or
twice
we
thought
her
done
for
but
always
her
turret
revolved
and
her
guns
opened
again
in
her
lighter
draught
she
had
a
great
advantage
she
could
turn
and
wind
where
we
could
not
the
minnesota
took
a
hand
and
an
iron
battery
from
the
shore
we
were
striving
to
ram
the
ericsson
but
we
could
not
get
close
to
her
our
iron
beak
too
was
sticking
in
the
side
of
the
sunken
cumberland
we
could
only
ram
with
the
blunt
prow
the
minnesota
as
we
passed
gave
us
all
her
broadside
guns
a
tremendous
fusillade
at
range
which
would
have
sunk
any
ship
of
the
swan
breed
the
turtle
shook
off
shot
and
shell
grape
and
canister
and
answered
with
her
bow
gun
the
shell
which
it
threw
entered
the
side
of
the
frigate
and
bursting
amidship
exploded
a
store
of
powder
and
set
the
ship
on
fire
leaving
disaster
aboard
the
minnesota
we
turned
and
sunk
the
tugboat
dragon
then
came
manoeuvre
and
manoeuvre
to
gain
position
where
we
could
ram
the
monitor
we
got
it
at
last
the
engines
made
an
effort
like
the
leap
of
the
spirit
before
expiring
ahead
full
speed
we
went
we
bore
down
upon
the
monitor
now
in
deeper
water
but
at
the
moment
that
we
saw
victory
she
turned
our
bow
lacking
the
iron
beak
gave
but
a
glancing
stroke
it
was
heavy
as
it
was
the
monitor
shook
like
a
man
with
the
ague
but
she
did
not
share
the
fate
of
the
cumberland
there
was
no
ragged
hole
in
her
side
her
armour
was
good
and
held
she
backed
gathered
herself
together
then
rushed
forward
striving
to
ram
us
in
her
turn
but
our
armour
too
was
good
and
held
then
she
came
upon
the
merrimac
quarter
laid
her
bow
against
the
shell
and
fired
her
guns
twice
in
succession
we
were
so
close
each
to
the
other
that
it
was
as
though
two
duelists
were
standing
upon
the
same
cloak
frightful
enough
was
the
concussion
of
those
guns
that
charge
drove
in
the
merrimac
iron
side
three
inches
or
more
the
shots
struck
above
the
ports
of
the
after
guns
and
every
man
at
those
guns
was
knocked
down
by
the
impact
and
bled
at
the
nose
and
ears
the
monitor
dropped
astern
and
again
we
turned
and
tried
to
ram
her
but
her
far
lighter
draught
put
her
where
we
could
not
go
our
bow
too
was
now
twisted
and
splintered
our
powder
was
getting
low
we
did
not
spare
it
we
could
not
we
sent
shot
and
shell
continuously
against
the
monitor
and
she
answered
in
kind
monitor
and
merrimac
we
went
now
this
way
now
that
the
ericsson
much
the
lighter
and
quickest
the
merrimac
fettered
by
her
poor
old
engines
and
her
great
length
and
her
feet
draught
it
was
two
in
the
afternoon
the
duelists
stepped
from
off
the
cloak
tried
operations
at
a
distance
hung
for
a
moment
in
the
wind
of
indecision
then
put
down
the
match
from
the
gunners
hands
the
monitor
darted
from
us
her
head
toward
the
shoal
water
known
as
the
middle
ground
she
reached
it
and
rested
triumphant
out
of
all
danger
from
our
ram
and
yet
where
she
could
still
protect
the
minnesota
a
curious
silence
fell
upon
the
roads
sullen
like
the
hush
before
a
thunderstorm
and
yet
not
like
that
for
we
had
had
the
thunderstorm
it
was
the
stillness
perhaps
of
exhaustion
it
was
late
afternoon
the
fighting
had
been
heavy
the
air
was
filled
with
smoke
in
the
water
were
floating
spars
and
wreckage
of
the
ships
we
had
destroyed
the
weather
was
sultry
and
still
the
dogged
booming
of
a
gun
from
a
shore
battery
sounded
lonely
and
remote
as
a
bell
buoy
the
tide
was
falling
there
were
enough
between
us
and
sewell
point
we
waited
an
hour
the
monitor
was
rightly
content
with
the
middle
ground
and
would
not
come
back
for
all
our
charming
we
fired
at
intervals
upon
her
and
upon
the
minnesota
but
at
last
our
powder
grew
so
low
that
we
ceased
the
tide
continued
to
fall
and
the
pilot
had
much
to
say
the
red
sun
sank
in
the
west
the
engineers
fed
the
ancient
mariners
with
montgomery
coal
black
smoke
gushed
forth
and
pilots
felt
their
way
into
the
south
channel
and
slowly
slowly
back
toward
sewell
point
the
day
closed
in
a
murky
evening
with
a
taste
of
smoke
in
the
air
in
the
the
monitor
went
down
the
roads
to
fortress
monroe
and
in
the
morning
we
took
the
merrimac
into
dry
dock
at
norfolk
her
armour
was
dented
all
over
though
not
pierced
her
bow
was
bent
and
twisted
the
iron
beak
lost
in
the
side
of
the
cumberland
her
boats
were
gone
and
her
smokestack
as
full
of
holes
as
any
colander
and
the
engines
at
the
last
gasp
several
of
the
guns
were
injured
and
coal
and
powder
and
ammunition
all
lacked
we
put
her
there
the
dear
and
ugly
warship
the
first
of
the
we
put
her
there
in
dry
dock
and
there

there
goes
the
artillery
now
there
goes
rockbridge
yes
sir
fall
in
in
double
column
almost
the
entire
fighting
force
of
the
army
of
the
valley
crossed
the
endless
open
meadow
beneath
kimball
batteries
that
the
latter
range
was
poor
was
a
piece
of
golden
fortune
the
shells
crossed
to
the
wood
or
exploded
high
in
blue
air
harmless
they
might
be
but
undeniably
they
were
trying
involuntarily
the
men
stared
fascinated
at
each
round
white
cloud
above
them
involuntarily
jerked
their
heads
at
each
rending
explosion
from
a
furrowed
ridge
below
the
guns
musketry
took
a
hand
the
army
of
the
valley
here
first
met
with
minie
balls
the
sound
with
which
they
came
curdled
the
blood
that
what
that
that
something
new
infernal
things
billy
maydew
walking
with
his
eyes
on
the
minies
stumbled
over
a
fairy
ring
and
came
to
his
knees
lieutenant
coffin
swore
at
gawking
and
gaping
as
though
christmas
and
roman
candles
going
off
getup
billy
arose
and
marched
on
i
air
to
kill
him
yes
sir
i
air
to
kill
him
yet
shoo
said
the
man
beside
him
he
do
mean
no
harm
he
jest
as
nervous
as
a
filly
and
he
got
to
take
it
out
on
some
one
next
of
officers
he
be
down
and
sho
how
them
things
do
screech
the
meadow
closed
with
a
wooded
hill
the
grey
lines
reaching
shelter
gasped
with
relief
the
way
was
steep
however
and
the
shells
still
rained
an
oak
struck
and
split
by
solid
shot
fell
across
the
way
a
line
of
ambulances
coming
somehow
upon
the
hillside
fared
badly
up
the
men
strained
to
the
top
which
proved
to
be
a
wide
level
the
rockbridge
battery
passed
them
at
a
gallop
to
be
greeted
by
a
shell
thrown
from
a
pounder
on
the
federal
right
it
struck
a
wheel
horse
of
one
of
the
howitzers
burst
and
made
fearful
havoc
torn
flesh
and
blood
were
everywhere
a
second
horse
was
mangled
only
less
horribly
than
the
first
the
third
a
strong
white
mare
was
so
covered
with
the
blood
of
her
fellows
and
from
a
wound
of
her
own
that
she
looked
a
roan
the
driver
spine
was
crushed
the
foot
of
a
gunner
was
taken
off
clean
at
the
ankle
as
by
a
scythe
the
noise
was
dreadful
the
shriek
that
the
mare
gave
echoed
through
the
march
woods
the
other
guns
of
the
battery
together
with
carpenter
and
waters
swept
round
the
ruin
and
over
the
high
open
ground
toward
a
stone
wall
that
ran
diagonally
across
the
infantry
followed
and
came
out
on
an
old
field
strewn
with
rocks
and
blackberry
bushes
in
the
distance
stretched
another
long
stone
wall
beyond
it
on
the
gentle
slopes
were
guns
enough
and
blue
soldiers
enough
blue
soldiers
with
bright
flags
above
them
and
somewhere
still
that
insistent
music
they
huzzahed
when
they
saw
the
confederates
and
the
confederates
answered
with
that
strangest
battle
shout
that
wild
and
high
and
ringing
cry
called
the
rebel
yell
in
the
woods
along
the
ridge
and
in
the
old
field
itself
the
infantry
deployed
there
were
portions
of
three
brigades
fulkerson
burk
and
the
stonewall
fulkerson
held
the
left
burk
with
the
irish
battalion
the
right
and
garnett
the
centre
the
position
was
commanding
the
confederate
strength
massed
before
the
federal
right
shields
centre
well
to
the
eastward
and
his
left
under
sullivan
in
the
air
on
the
other
side
of
the
pike
it
was
stonewall
desire
to
turn
that
right
flank
to
crumple
it
back
upon
the
centre
and
to
sweep
by
on
the
road
to
winchester
the
loved
valley
town
so
near
that
one
might
see
its
bourgeoning
trees
hear
its
church
bells
he
rode
on
little
sorrel
up
and
down
the
forming
lines
and
he
spoke
only
to
give
orders
quiet
and
curt
much
in
his
tone
he
was
all
brown
like
a
leaf
with
valley
dust
and
sun
and
rain
the
old
cadet
cap
was
older
yet
the
ancient
boots
as
grotesquely
large
the
curious
lift
of
his
hand
to
heaven
no
less
curious
than
it
had
always
been
he
was
as
awkward
as
hypochondriac
as
literal
as
strict
as
ever
moreover
there
should
have
hung
about
him
the
cloud
of
disfavour
and
hostility
raised
by
that
icy
march
to
romney
less
than
three
months
ago
and
yet
and
yet
what
had
happened
since
then
not
much
indeed
the
return
of
the
stonewall
brigade
to
winchester
loring
representations
the
war
department
interference
and
resignation
from
the
service
and
request
to
be
returned
to
the
virginia
military
institute
general
johnston
remonstrance
and
the
withdrawal
of
old
jack
resignation
there
had
been
some
surprise
among
the
men
at
the
effect
upon
themselves
of
this
withdrawal
they
had
greeted
the
news
with
hurrahs
they
had
been
all
that
day
in
extraordinary
spirits
why
to
save
them
they
could
not
have
told
he
had
not
won
any
battles
he
had
been
harsh
hostile
pedantic
suspected
and
detested
upon
that
unutterable
bath
and
romney
trip
and
yet
and
yet
he
was
cheered
when
at
winchester
it
was
known
that
the
army
of
the
valley
and
not
the
virginia
military
institute
was
to
have
jackson
services
he
was
cheered
when
at
short
intervals
in
the
month
or
two
there
in
camp
he
reviewed
his
army
he
was
cheered
when
a
month
ago
the
army
left
winchester
left
the
loving
and
loved
town
to
be
occupied
by
the
enemy
left
it
and
moved
southward
to
new
market
he
was
cheered
loudly
when
two
days
before
had
come
the
order
to
march
to
march
northward
back
along
the
pike
back
toward
winchester
he
was
cheered
now
as
he
rode
quietly
to
and
fro
forming
his
line
of
battle
fulkerson
and
virginia
on
the
left
then
the
supported
by
the
in
the
second
line
the
the
the
the
a
little
back
the
irish
battalion
and
at
the
bottom
of
the
ridge
the
keeping
touch
with
ashby
toward
the
pike
it
was
two
of
the
afternoon
beautiful
and
bright
a
brigadier
meeting
him
said
we
were
not
sure
general
that
you
would
fight
it
is
sunday
the
other
fastened
upon
him
his
steady
eyes
the
god
of
battles
sir
as
a
great
general
will
understand
i
trust
that
every
regiment
may
have
service
in
winchester

your
skirmishers
and
send
a
regiment
to
support
carpenter

the
virginia
target
for
a
withering
artillery
fire
crossed
the
open
and
disappeared
in
a
strip
of
march
wood
high
and
keen
and
brown
against
the
fleckless
sky
behind
it
two
long
grey
lines
moved
slowly
forward
out
now
in
the
old
field
the
men
talked
as
they
went
wish
there
was
nice
ripe
blackberries
on
these
bushes
wish
i
was
a
little
boy
again
with
a

his
voice
their
fire
is
do
reckon
they
tired
of
it
sir
hope
their
ammunition
out
from
the
rear
galloped
a
courier
where
general
jackson
drawing
off
a
big
body
horse
and
foot
is
backing
toward
winchester
glory
hallelujah
said
the
men
maybe
we
wo
have
to
fight
on
sunday
after
all
out
of
the
march
woods
ahead
broke
a
thunderclap
of
sound
settling
into
a
roar
of
musketry
it
endured
for
some
minutes
then
forth
from
the
thickets
and
shadow
of
the
forest
back
from
barton
woods
into
the
ragged
old
field
reeled
the

down

and
half
carried

by
his

there
were
fifty

the

most
of

were
helped
back
by
their

he
deployed
his
men
under

but
now
they
were
out
in
a
great
and
ragged
field
all
up
and
down
with
boggy
hollows
scarred
too
by
rail
fences
and
blurred
by
briar
patches
diagonally
across
it
many
yards
away
ran
one
of
the
stone
fences
of
the
region
a
long
dike
of
loosely
piled
and
rounded
rock
beyond
it
the
ground
kept
the
same
nature
but
gradually
lifted
to
a
fringe
of
tall
trees
emerging
from
this
wood
came
now
a
federal
line
of
battle
it
came
with
pomp
and
circumstance
the
sun
shone
on

thousand
bayonets
bright
colours

in

that
the
man
they
called
stonewall
jackson
meant
to
turn
his
right
and
he
began
to
mass
his
regiments
and
he
sent
for

the

and
eyed
the

a
hunter
from

hills
we
a
long
sight
better
have
it
than
those
fellows
sh
the

speaking
fulkerson
speech
was
a
shout
for
there
had
arisen
a
deafening
noise
of
artillery

the

as
they
ran
the

threw
forward
their
muskets
and
fired
that
volley

at
close
range

it
was
discharged
by

along

and
fired
the

withstood
that
volley
even
continued
its
advance
but
a

poured
in

they
surged
back
to
the

to
the

a
fence
at

angles
with
that
held
by
the
confederates
now
began
upon
the

the
fight
of
the
stone
wall
hours
of
raging
battle
of
high
quarrel
for
this
barrier
the
regiments
composing
the
grey
centre
found
time
to
cheer
for
fulkerson
the
rumour
of
the
fight
reached
the
right
where
ashby
squadron
held
the
pike
jackson
himself
came
on

sorrel
looked
at
the

and
the
line
of
men
powder
grimed
about
the
lips
plying
the
ramrods
shouldering
the
muskets
keeping
back
tyler
regiments
and
said
good
good
across
a
mile
of
field
thundered
an
artillery
duel
loud
and
prolonged
the
blue
had
many
guns
the
grey
eighteen
in
action
there
were
indeed
but
seventeen
for
a
tredegar

disabled
in
crossing
the

the
blue
were
the
stronger
cannon
modern
powerful
the
grey
were
inferior
there
also
the
grey
must
reach
deeper
and
deeper
into
caisson
and
limber
chest
must
cast
anxious
backward
glances
toward
ordnance
wagons
growing
woefully
light
the
fire
of
the
blue
was
extremely
heavy
the
fire
of
the
grey
as
heavy
as
possible
considering
the
question
of
ammunition
rockbridge
worked
its
guns
in
a
narrow
clearing
dotted
with
straw
stacks
a
section
under
lieutenant
poague
was
sent
at
a
gallop
half
a
mile
forward
to
a
point
that
seemed
of
vantage
here
the
unlimbering
guns
found
themselves
in
infantry
company
a
regiment
lying
flat
awaiting
orders
hello
said
the
gunners

going
to

at

could
see
us
a
shell
fell
beside
the
howitzer
and
burst
with
appalling
sound
the
gun
was
blown
from
position
and
out
of
the
smoke
came
a
fearful
cry
of
wounded
men
o
god
o

the
smoke
cleared
all
who
had
served
that
gun
were
down
their

came
swaying
down
allan
jerked
a
musket
from
a
dead
man
grasp
and
together
he
and
billy
somehow
fastened
the
flag
to
the
bayonet
and
lifted
it
high
the
line
halted
under
a
momentary
cover
made
by
the
rising
side
of
a
hollow
rimmed
by
a
few
young
locust
trees
cleave
came
along
it
close
ranks
men

general

looking
fix
bayonets
forward
charge
up
out
of
the
hollow
and
over
the
field
went
the
in
a
wild
charge
the
noise
of
a
thousand
seas
was
in
the
air
and
the
smoke
of
the
bottomless
pit
the
yellow
flashes
of
the
guns
came
through
it
and
a
blur
of
colour
the
flag
on
the
bank
on
went
their
own
great
slanting
forward
as
billy
maydew
ran
the
bank
flamed
and
roared
a
bullet
passed
through
the
fleshy
part
of
the
boy
arm
he
looked
sideways
at
the
blood
those
durned
bees
sure
do
sting
i
air
to
plant
this
here
flag
on
that
thar
bank
jest
the

as
if

in

garden
fulkerson
fought
on
grimly
by
the
stone
wall
garnett
and
the
other
stonewall

struggled
with
desperation
to
hold
the

the

thundered
from

mounted
first
allan
followed
then
billy

the
thunder
run
men
the
regiment
pouring
after
hot
was
the
welcome
they
got
and
fierce
was
their
answering
grip
in
places
men
could
load
and
fire
but
bayonet
and
musket
butt
did
much
of
the
work
there
was
a
great
clamour
the
acrid
smell
of
powder
the
indescribable
taste
of
battle
the
flag
was
down
the
red
with
the
blue
cross
in
its
place
there
was
a
surge
of
the
western
regiment
toward
it
a
battle
around
it
that
strewed
the
bank
and
the
shallow
ditch
beneath
with
many
a
blue
figure
many
a
grey
step
by
step
the
grey
pushed
the
blue
back
away
from
the
bank
back
toward
the
wood
arising
shadowy
from
a
base
of
eddying
smoke
out
of
the
smoke
suddenly
came
hurrahing
it
was
deep
and
loud
issuing
from
many
throats
the
western
regiment
began
to
hurrah
too
they
coming
to

from

to
reinforce
the
blue
wave
in
front
the
struggled
with
thrice
its
numbers
and
there
was
a
noise
from
the
wood
which
portended
more
back
inch
by
inch
gave
the
grey
fighting
desperately
they
loaded
fired
loaded

they
used
bayonet
and
musket

the
blue
fell
thick
but
always
others
came
to
take
their
places
the
grey
fell
and
the
ranks

close
with
none

bleeding
from
a
bayonet
thrust
in

ordered
the
retreat
on
the
crest
of

there
was
confusion
and
clamour
shots
and
shouts
the
groans
of

it
was
almost
dusk
to
the
green
and
rolling
world
about
the
field
of
kernstown
upon
that
field
beneath
the
sulphurous
battle
cloud
it
was
dusk
indeed
the
fighting
line
was
everywhere
and
for
the
confederates
there
were
no
reinforcements
fulkerson
yet
held
the
left
garnett
with
conspicuous
gallantry
the
centre
with
the
stonewall
regiments
the
batteries
yet
thundered
upon
the
right
but
ammunition
was
low
and
for
three
hours
ashby
mistake
as
to
the
enemy
numbers
had
received
full
demonstration
shields
brigadiers
did
well
and
the
blue
soldiers
did
well
a
body
of
troops
coming
from
the
wood
and
crowding
through
a
gap
in
a
stone
fence
descended
upon
the
rockbridge
battery
four
regiments
of
the
stonewall
brigade
clung
desperately
to
the
great
uneven
field
which
marked
the
centre
the
musket
barrels
were
burningly
hot
to
the
touch
of
the
men
their
fingers
must
grope
for
the
cartridges
rattling
in
the
cartridge
boxes
their
weariness
was
horrible
their
eyes
were
glazed
their
lips
baked
with
thirst
long
ago
they
had
fought
in
a
great
bright
glaring
daytime
then
again
long
ago
they
had
begun
to
fight
in
a
period
of
dusk
an
age
of
dusk
the
men
loaded
fired
loaded
rammed
fired
quite
automatically
they
had
been
doing
this
for
a
long
long
time
probably
they
would
do
it
for
a
long
time
to
come
only
the
cartridges
were
not
automatically
supplied
it
even
seemed
that
they
might
one
day
come
to
an
end
the
dusk
deepened
they
had
beneath
the
battle
clouds
a
glimpse
of
garnett
a
general
chivalric
and
loved
standing
in
his
stirrups
looking
out
and
upward
toward
the
dark
wood
and
sullivan
fresh
regiments
a
sergeant
came
along
the
line
stretching
a
haversack
open
with
his
hands
in
it
were
cartridges
i
gathered
all
the
dead
had
many
you
got
to
shoot
to
kill
boys
a
man
with
a
ball
through
the
end
of
his
spine
lying
not
far
from
a
hollow
of
the
earth
half
pool
half
bog
began
to
cry
aloud
in
an
agonizing
fashion
water
water
oh
some
one
give
me
water
water
for
the
love
of
god
water
a
grey
soldier
started
out
of
line
toward
him
in
a
second
both
were
killed
garnett
settled
down
in
his
saddle
and
came
back
to
the
irregular
swaying
line
he
spoke
to
his
colonels
there
are
three
thousand
fresh
bayonets
at
the
back
of
these
woods
general
jackson
does
not
wish
a
massacre
i
will
withdraw
the
brigade
the
troops
were
ready
to
go
they
had
held
the
centre
very
long
the
cartridges
were
all
but
spent
the
loss
was
heavy
they
were
deadly
tired
they
wanted
water
to
drink
and
to
hear
the
command
ranks
garnett
was
gallant
and
brave
they
saw
that
he
did
what
he
did
with
reason
and
their
judgment
acquiesced
there
was
momently
a
fresh
foe
without
much
alignment
fighting
in
squads
or
singly
firing
as
they
went
from
thicket
and
hollow
at
the
heavy
masses
the
stonewall
brigade
fell
back
upon
the
wood
to
the
south
the
blue
wave
saw
victory
and
burst
into
a
shout
of
triumph
kimbal
batteries
too
began
a
jubilant
thunder
over
the
field
from
fulkerson
on
the
left
to
the
broken
centre
and
the
withdrawing
troops
came
a
sorrel
urged
to
a
furious
gallop
upon
it
a
figure
all
dusk
in
the
dusk
a
of
a
man
angered
now
to
a
degree
with
an
eye
like
steel
and
a
voice
like
ice
he
rode
up
to
garnett
as
though
he
would
ride
him
down
general
garnett
what
are
you
doing
go
back
at
once
sir
as
he
spoke
he
threw
himself
from
the
saddle
and
closed
his
gauntleted
hand
with
force
on
the
arm
of
a
drummer
boy
beat
the
rally
he
commanded
the
rapid
and
continuous
rolling
filled
like
a
sound
of
the
sea
the
ears
of
the
stonewall
brigade
garnett
in
a
strange
voice
gave
the
the
men
uttered
a
hard
and
painful
gasp
they
looked
and
saw
stonewall
jackson
lifted
above
them
an
iron
figure
in
a
storm
of
shot
and
shell
he
jerked
his
hand
into
the
air
he
shouted
back
men
give
them
the
bayonet
the
drum
beat
on
colonels
and
captains
and
lieutenants
strove
to
aid
him
and
to
change
the
retreat
into
an
advance
in
vain
the
commands
were
shattered
the
fighting
line
all
broken
and
dispersed
the
men
did
not
shamefully
flee
they
retreated
sullenly
staying
here
and
there
where
there
were
yet
cartridges
to
fire
upon
the
foe
but
they
continued
to
go
back
the
and
the
with
funsten
small
cavalry
command
came
hastening
to
the
broken
centre
and
there
made
a
desperate
fight
the

the

the

broke

gave

and

as
best
he
might
rockbridge
and
carpenter
and
waters
no
longer
thundered
from
the
heights
the
grey
infantry
wildly
scattered
came
in
a
slow
surge
back
through
the
woods
where
dead
men
lay
among
the
spring
flowers
and
down
the
ridge
and
through
the
fields
grey
and
dank
in
the

toward

night
and
the
lost
battle
weighed
upon
the
army
the
shadowy
ambulances
the
lights
of
the
gatherers
of
the
wounded
flitting
few
and
far
over
the
field
made
for
a
ghastly
depression
sick
at
heart
in
a
daze
of
weariness
hunger
and
thirst
drunk
with
sleep
mad
for
rest
command
by
command
stumbled
down
the
pike
or
through
the
fields
to
where
several
miles
to
the
south
stretched
the
meadows
where
their
trains
were
parked
there
was
no
pursuit

and
fields
were

sometimes
a

i
do
believe
that

just
now
indeed
it
not

that
mcclellan
will
have
to

with

they

if

and
moaning
as
they
slept
the
stars
were
very
bright
in
the
clear
cold
windy
night
he
looked
at
them
and
thought
of
the
battle
and
of
the
dead
and
the
wounded
and
of
judith
and
of
his
mother
and
sister
and
of

rude

stonewall
jackson
and
his
army
in
slow
retreat
up
the
valley
came
the
second
day
after
kernstown
to
the
gorge
of
cedar
creek
a
bridge
had
once
been
here
there
remained
the
blackened
and
a
portion
of
the
flooring
the
water
below
was
cold
deep
and
rapid
rather
than
breast
it
the
army
made
shift
to
cross
on
the
charred
wood
an
infantry
command
stepping
gingerly
heard
behind
it
shots
and
shouts
a
federal
cavalry
charge
upon
the
rear
guard
several
of
the
men
listening
too
absorbedly
or
not
content
with
the
present
motion
suddenly
left
the
timbers
and
entered
the
rough
and
swollen
creek
that
poured
beneath
their
exclamations
in
this
berth
were
piteous
and
their
comrades
fished
them
out
with
bayonets
and
laughter
upon
the
night
of
the
banks
troopers
occupied
the
northern
shore
of
tom
brook
ashby
held
the
southern
side
and
held
it
fast
behind
that
safe
and
vigilant
and
valiant
screen
the
army
of
the
valley
moved
quietly
and
in
good
spirits
to
the
points
its
general
had
in
mind
the
army
never
knew
what
were
these
points
until
it
found
itself
actually
upon
the
ground
it
is
morally
certain
that
had
he
lived
a
recalcitrant
in
former
days
no
amount
of
forte
et
would
have
opened
the
lips
of
stonewall
jackson
had
he
willed
to
keep
them
closed
during
their
earlier
acquaintance
officers
and
men
alike
had
made
many
an
ingenious
endeavour
to
learn
the
plans
they
thought
they
ought
to
know
they
set
quaint
traps
they
made
remarks
they
guided
right
they
guided
left
they
blazed
beautiful
trails
straight
they
thought
to
the
moment
of
revelation
it
never
came
he
walked
past
and
around
and
over
their
traps
inquisitive
officers
found
themselves
not
only
without
a
straw
of
information
but
under
displeasure
brilliant
leading
remarks
shone
a
moment
by
their
own
brilliancy
then
went
out
the
troops
conjectured
one
road
they
went
by
another
natives
described
the
beauties
of
the
village
before
which
they
were
sure
to
break
ranks
at
eve
they
experienced
the
hospitalities
of
quite
another
town
generals
in
the
ranks
demonstrated
that
they
were
going
to
turn
on
shields
or
that
they
were
going
east
by
the
old
manassas
gap
and
whip
geary
or
northeast
and
whip
abercrombie
they
did
none
of
the
three
they
marched
on
up
the
valley
to
rude
hill
near
mount
jackson
about
this
time
or
a
little
later
men
and
officers
gave
it
up
began
to
admire
and
to
follow
blindly
a
sergeant
one
evening
put
it
to
his
mess
if
we
do
know
then
banks
and
shields
and
fremont
and
milroy
and
mcclellan
and
lincoln
and
stanton
do
know
either
the
mess
grew
thoughtful
presently
it
took
the
pipe
from
its
mouth
to
answer
it
martin
that
true
never
saw
it
just
that
way
before
rude
hill
formed
a
strong
natural
position
there
was
water
there
were
woods
there
was
an
excellent
space
for
a
directions
as
to
were
always
characteristically
explicit
you
will
see
that
a
camp
is
chosen
where
there
are
wood
water
and
a
emphasis
on
the
at
rude
hill
they
drilled
and
drilled
and
drilled
every
morning
rang
out
adjutant
call
every
morning
there
were
infantry
evolutions
artillery
evolutions
the
artillery
had
some
respite
for
turn
by
turn
the
sections
went
forward
ten
miles
to
do
picket
duty
for
ashby
chew
horse
artillery
being
continually
engaged
with
the
federal
outposts
but
the
infantry
drilled
on
drilled
and
wondered
at
banks
one
week
two
weeks
and
the
general
in
blue
with
nineteen
thousand
men
still
on
the
farther
side
of
brook
despite
the
drilling
the
army
of
the
valley
had
a
good
time
at
hill
below
brawled
the
shenandoah
just
to
the
east
sprang
the
massanuttens
there
was
much
rain
but
day
by
day
through
the
silver
veil
or
the
shattered
golden
light
lovelier
and
more
lovely
grew
the
spring
the
army
liked
to
see
her
coming
in
its
heart
it
felt
a
springtime
too
a
gush
of
hope
and
ardour
the
men
hardly
counted
kernstown
a
defeat
it
was
known
that
old
jack
had
said
to
one
of
the
aides
i
may
say
that
i
am
satisfied
sir
and
congress
had
thanked
the
army
of
the
valley
and
all
the
newspapers
sang
its
praises
the
battle
of
pea
ridge
in
arkansas
the
shelling
of
newbern
in
north
carolina
the
exploits
of
the
merrimac
in
hampton
roads
the
battle
of
kernstown
in
the
valley
so
at
the
moment
ran
the
newspapers
and
day
by
day
recruits
were
coming
in
comrades
as
well
who
had
been
in
hospital
or
home
on
furlough
in
that
fortnight
the
army
of
the
valley
grew
to
number
nearly
six
thousand
men
at
rude
hill
there
was
an
election
of
company
officers
the
proceedings
amazing
enough
to
the
professional
soldier
put
into
camp
life
three
days
of
excitement
and
salt
given
a
people
of
strong
political
proclivities
suddenly
turned
soldier
given
human
grudges
and
likings
admirations
and
contempts
given
the
ballot
in
military
as
in
civil
life
given
a
chance
to
inject
champagne
into
the
ennui
of
camp
existence
and
in
lieu
of
gun
practice
to
send
off
and
catherine
wheels
given
a
warm
personal
interest
in
each
private
bosom
as
to
whom
for
the
next
twelfth
month
if
the
war
lasted
that
long
he
was
going
to
obey
and
there
resulted
a
shattering
of
monotony
comparable
to
a
pitched
battle
the
elections
were
held
in
beautiful
vernal
groves
that
there
would
be
changes
it
was
believed
change
was
in
the
air
for
days
beforehand
the
character
for
conduct
courage
and
general
agreeableness
of
every
man
who
wore
three
bars
on
his
collar
or
two
or
one
or
who
carried
chevrons
of
silk
or
chevrons
of
worsted
had
been
strictly
in
the
zone
of
fire
certain
officers
nearing
certain
felt
caucuses
dissolving
at
their
approach
into
an
innocence
of
debating
societies
engaged
with
fabius
maximus
or
scipio
africanus
certain
sergeants
and
corporals
dreamed
bars
instead
of
chevrons
and
certain
high
privates
conscious
of
merit
saw
worsted
chevrons
silk
chevrons
and
gold
bars
all
in
one
blissful
night
but
when
election
day
dawned
bright
and
clear
with
a
fine
chorus
of
birds
and
an
especial
performance
by
the
regimental
bands
when
roll
call
was
over
and
camp
duties
were
over
and
morning
drill
was
over
no
relaxation
here
there
was
only
one
day
in
the
week
on
which
old
jack
let
up
on
drill
and
that
was
election
day
and
the
pickets
had
reluctantly
marched
away
leaving
their
votes
behind
them
and
a
section
of
artillery
had
gone
off
swearing
to
relieve
chew
and
the
men
could
at
last
get
down
to
work
to
happy
babbling
happy
speechifying
happy
minding
the
polls
and
when
in
the
cool
of
the
afternoon
the
returns
were
announced
there
were
fewer
changes
than
had
been
predicted
after
all
most
of
the
officers
were
satisfactory
why
let
them
down
with
a
jolt
and
the
privates
were
satisfactory
too
why
take
a
capital
comrade
a
good
cook
and
forager
and
and
make
him
uncomfortable
by
turning
him
into
an
officer
he
was
nice
enough
as
he
was
not
that
there
were
no
alterations
several
companies
had
new
captains
some
lieutenants
stepped
down
and
there
was
a
shifting
of
officers
in
company
a
of
the
lieutenant
mathew
coffin
lost
out
the
men
wished
to
put
up
allan
gold
for
the
lieutenancy
but
allan
declined
he
had
rather
he
said
be
scout
than
lieutenant
and
what
was
the
use
in
changing
anyhow
lieutenant
coffin
was
all
right
had
he
been
as
brave
as
a
lion
at
kernstown
and
any
man
is
liable
to
lose
his
temper
at
times
and
would
we
hate
him
to
have
to
write
back
to
that
young
lady
at
home
the
last
plea
almost
settled
it
for
the
confederate
heart
might
be
trusted
to
melt
at
the
mention
of
any
young
lady
at
home
but
all
the
thunder
run
men
were
against
coffin
and
thunder
run
turned
the
scale
in
the
main
however
throughout
the
army
company
officers
were
retained
and
retained
because
they
were
efficient
the
election
was
fun
and
the
men
cheered
the
returns
then
listened
to
the
orders
of
the
evening
from
the
same
old
bars
and
chevrons
the
sun
went
down
on
a
veritable
love
feast
special
rations
special
music
special
fires
and
between
supper
and
tattoo
an
entertainment

the

tent
was
not

there
were
a
table
and
two
stools
on

of

sat
jackson
in
his
characteristic
position
large
feet
accurately
paralleled
on
the
table
beside
the
candle
lay
three
books
the
bible

and
went
on

page
having
here
signed
his
name
he
dropped
the
quill
and
slightly
turned
so
as
to

waiting
officer

high
bronzed
forehead

had
been
thus
summoned
since
that
unlucky
winter
evening
at
bloomery
gap
he
remembered
that
evening
and
he
did
not
suppose
that
his
general
had
forgotten
it
he
did
not
suppose
that
jackson
forgot
anything
but
apparently
it
was
no

counted

face
wore
the
quiet
friendly
somewhat
sweet
expression
usual
to
it
when
all
was
calm
within
as
for

himself

nature
owned
a
certain
primal
flow
and
bigness
there
were

fixed
and
rigid
barriers
injured
pride
and
resentment
did
not
lift
themselves
into
reefs
against
which
the
mind
must
break
in
torment
rather
his
being
swept
fluid
making
no
great
account
of
obstacles
accepting
all
turns
of
affairs
drawing
them
into
its
main
current

moving
onward

goal
hardly

simple
humane
and
universal
the

might
have
felt

passed
away

ewell
and
myself
he
wishes
to

seems
to
think
it
natural
that

should
tell
him
them
i
am
not
a
great
letter
writer
you
will
give
him
all
the
information
that

the
army

a
great
deal

it
is
not
sir
you
are
at
liberty
to
give
to
general
ewell
your
own
observations
and
expectations

will
however
represent
them
as
your
own
may
i
ask
sir
when
this
junction
is
to
occur
i
have
not
decided
sir
does
general
ewell
know
when
it
will
occur
not
precisely
he
will
be
told
in
good
time
whether
when
you
move
you
move
north
or
west
or
south
or
east
is
i
suppose
sir
purely
a
matter
of
conjecture
purely
sir
but
the
of
the
army
its
efficiency
and
spirit
may
be
freely
praised
and
imparted

want
from

your
impression
of

the
greenwood
carriage
rolled
out
of
the
town
into
the
april
country
the
fruit
trees
were
in
bloom
the
woods
feathering
green
the
quiet
and
the
golden
light
inestimable
after
the
moaning
wards
the
carriage
went
slowly
for
the
roads
were
heavy
moreover
the
former
carriage
horses
were
gone
to
the
war
these
were
two
from
the
farm
somewhat
old
and
stiff
willing
but
plodders
they
went
half
asleep
in
the
soft
sunshine
and
isham
on
the
box
went
half
asleep
too
judith
would
have
been
willing
to
sleep
but
she
could
not
she
sat
with
her
gaze
upon
the
fair
spring
woods
and
the
amethystine
hills
rising
to
blue
skies
the
carriage
stopped

then
said
judith
there
is
some
message
perhaps
while
they
waited
she
sat
with
folded
hands
her
eyes
upon
the
purple
hills
her
thoughts
away
from
albemarle
the
sound
that
isham
made
of
surprise
and
satisfaction
did
not
reach
her
until
she
saw
cleave
face
at
the
window
she
thought
him
somewhere
in
the
valley
fighting
fighting
in
battle
and
danger
perhaps
that
very
day
her
eyes
widened
her
face
had
the
hush
of
dawn
it
was
turned
toward
him
but
she
sat
perfectly
still
without
speaking
only
the
door
was
between
them
the
glass
down
he
rested
his
clasped
hands
on
the
ledge
and
his
dark
moved
face
looked
in
upon
her
judith
he
said
i
did
not
i
thought
it
was
one
of
the
others
i
hope
that
you
are
a
little
glad
to
see
me
judith
looked
at
him
a
moment
longer
then
swayed
a
little
forward
she
bent
her
head
her
cheek
touched
his
clasped
hands
he
felt
her
kiss
upon
them
and
her
forehead
resting
there
there
was
a
moment
silence
deep
breathless
then
cleave
spoke
judith

i
mad

believe
that

he
said

the
carriage
on
she
did
so
the
road
was
quiet
deserted
a
wide
bright
path
between
the
evening
hills
dundee
following
them
they
walked
a
little
way
until
they
came
to
a
great
rock
sunk
in
the
velvet
sward
that
edged
a
wood
here
they
sat
down
the
gold
light
bathing
them
behind
them
fairy
vistas
fountains
of
living
green
stars
of
the
dogwood
and
purple
sprays
of
judas
tree
how
i
misunderstood
is
no
matter
now
said
cleave
i
love
you
and
you
say
that
you
love
me
thank
god
for
it
they
sat
with
clasped
hands
their
cheeks
touching
their
breath
mingling
judith
judith

lovely
are
you
i
have
seen
you
always
always

have
seen
your
eyes
from
the
height
of
every
thought
you
have
beckoned
further
now
now
it
is
like
a
wonderful
and
yet
you
are
still
there
above
the
mountains
beckoning
drawing
there
and
here
here
in
my
arms
judith

short
furlough
i

not
willing
that

i
know
that
you

in
danger
every

rock

on
to
the
house
i
must
turn
at
once
but
i
could
speak
to
them
no
aunt
lucy
is
in
town
unity
too
let
say
before
we
reach
the
carriage
they
went
slowly
by
the
quiet
road
beneath
the
flowering
trees
the
light
was
now
only
on
the
hilltops
the
birds
were
silent
only
the
frogs
in
the
lush
meadows
kept
up
their
quiring
a
sound
quaintly
mournful
weirdly
charming
a
bend
of
the
road
showed
them
isham
the
farm
horses
and
the
great
old
carriage
waiting
beneath
a
tulip
tree
the
lovers
stopped
took
hands
moved
nearer
each
to
the
other
rested
each
in
the
other
arms
her
head
was
thrown
back
his
lips
touched
her
hair
her
forehead
her
lips
he
put
her
in
the
carriage
kissed
her
hands
as
they
lay
on
the
door
ledge
and
stood
back
it
was
not
far
to
the
greenwood
gates
the
old
slow
horses
moved
on
the
carriage
rounded
a
leafy
turn
the
road
was
left
to
the
soldier
and
his
horse
cleave
rode
to
gordonsville
that
night
as
though
he
carried
heaven
with
him
the
road
was
fair
the
moon
was
high
beautiful
odours
filled
the
air
the
red
ploughed
earth
sent
its
share
the
flowering
fruit
trees
theirs
the
flowers
in
the
wood
the
mint
by
the
stream
a
light
wind
swung
them
as
from
a
censer
the
moved
air
touched
the
young
man
forehead
he
took
off
his
hat
he
rode
rapidly
with
head
held
high
he
rode
for
hours
dundee
taking
the
way
with
even
power
a
magnificently
silent
friend
behind
on
an
iron
grey
came
the
orderly
riding
thus
together
away
from
organization
and
discipline
the
relations
between
the
two
men
officer
and
private
were
perfectly
democratic
from
rude
hill
across
the
massanuttons
and
from
swift
run
gap
to
charlottesville
they
had
been
simply
comrades
and
fellow
virginians
they
were
from
adjoining
counties
where
the
one
had
practised
law
and
the
other
had
driven
a
stage
there
were
differences
in
breeding
education
and
employment
but
around
these
recognized
by
both
stretched
the
enormous
plane
of
humanity
they
met
there
in
simple
brotherliness
however
cleave
had
spoken
for
silence
i
want
to
be
quiet
for
a
while
there
is
something
i
have
to
think
of
illustration
the
lovers
the
night
was
all
too
short
for
what
he
had
to
think
of
the
pink
flush
of
dawn
the
distant
view
of
ewell
tents
came
too
soon
it
was
hard
to
lower
the
height
and
swell
of
the
mind
to
push
back
the
surging
thoughts
to
leave
the
lift
and
wonder
the
moonlight
and
the
flowering
way
here
however
were
the
pickets
and
while
he
waited
for
the
corporal
of
the
guard
standing
with
harris
on
a
little
hill
before
them
the
pink
sky
below
them
a
peach
orchard
pink
too
with
a
mist
wreathing
the
trees
he
put
golden
afternoon
and
moonlight
night
in
the
bottom
of
his
heart
and
laid
duty
atop
ewell
camp
spread
over
the
rolling
hills
and
lighted
by
a
splendid
sunrise
lay
imposingly
to
the
eyes
of
the
men
from
the
valley
the
ordered
white
tents
of
trimble
and
taylor
and
the
maryland
line
had
an
air
luxuriously
martial
everything
seemed
to
gleam
and
shine
the
guns
of
the
parked
batteries
gave
back
the
light
the
colours
seemed
silken
and
fine
the
very
sunrise
gun
had
a
sonorousness
lacking
to
chew
blakeley
or
to
mclaughlin
and
the
bugles
blowing
reveille
a
silvery
quality
most
remarkable
as
for
the
smoke
from
the
lord
save
us
said
harris
i
believe
they
broiling
partridges
of
all
the
dandy
places
cleave
laughed
it
not
that
they
are
so
fine
but
that
we
are
so
and
rusty
they
only
in
good
trim
have
to
polish
up
at
rude
hill
this
is
the
maryland
on
the
hillside
said
the
guide
the
corporal
had
given
there
with
the
blue
flag
mighty
fine
feathers
but
i
reckon
they
gamecocks

right

energetically

eagerly

side

darky
cook
in
front
a
pine
table
over
which
a
coloured

began
upon
frumenty
all
right
i
move
and
i
suppose
when
i
get
there
old
jackson
vouchsafe
another
bob
you
damned
ethiopian
where
are
your
wits
fill
major
cleave
glad
to
welcome
you
major
to
camp
ewell
pretty
tidy
place
do
you
think
i
do
indeed
sir
have
you
seen
dick
taylor
beauties
his
creoles
and
tigers
and
harry
hayes
louisiana
the
maryland
line
too
and
trimble
and
elzey
damned
fine
army
how
about
yours
over
there
he
indicated
the
blue
ridge
with
a
jerk
and
helped
himself
again
to
frumenty
your
description
applies
there
too
sir
it
a
little
rough
and
ready
but
it
a
damned
fine
army
kernstown
did
shake
it
kernstown
was
as
much
a
victory
as
a
defeat
sir
no
it
did
shake
it
good
extraordinarily
so
that
army
is
all
right
sir
i
wish
said
ewell
plaintively
that
i
knew
what
to
make
of
general
jackson
what
do
you
make
of
him
major
i
make
a
genius
sir
ewell
raised
his
shoulder
and
ducked
his
head
his
bright
round
eyes
much
like
a
robin
and
he
is
crazy
not
in
the
very
least
well
i
had
my
doubts
i
am
glad
to
hear
you
say
that
i
want
to
think
mighty
well
of
the
man
who
leads
me
that
romney
trip
now
of
course
i
only
heard
loring
side
he
does
just
wind
in
and
out
of
mountains
for
the
fun
of
doing
it
i
think
that
generally
speaking
he
has
some
other
object
in
view
sir
i
think
that
acquaintance
with
general
jackson
will
show
you
what
i
mean
it
develops
confidence
in
a
very
marked
fashion
ewell
listened
i
am
glad
to
hear
you
say
that
for
damn
me
confidence
is
what
i
want
i
want
sir
to
be
that
my
commanding
officer
is
forever
and
eternally
right
and
then
i
want
to
be
let
go
ahead
i
want
to
be
let
feel
just
as
though
i
were
a
captain
of
fifty
dragoons
and
nothing
to
do
but
to
get
back
to
post
by
the
sunset
gun
and
report
the
work
done
and
so
you
think
that
when
my
force
and
old
jackson
force
get
together
we
do
big
things
fairly
big
sir
it
is
fortunate
to
expect
them
they
will
arrive
the
sooner
ewell
bobbed
his
head
yes
yes
that
true
now
major
i
going
to
review
the
troops
this
morning
and
then
i
write
an
answer
for
general
jackson
and
you
take
it
to
him
and
tell
him
i
coming
on
by
stanardsville
just
as
he
says
and
that
i
rest
on
sunday
maybe
even
we
find
a
church
presbyterian
he
rose
you
better
come
with
i
got
some
more
questions
to
ask
better
see
my
troops
too
old
jackson
might
as
well
know
what
beautiful
children
i
got
have
you
any
idea
yourself
what
i
expected
to
do
at
stanardsville
i
do
know
what
general
jackson
expects
sir
but
my
own
idea
is
that
you
not
be
long
at
stanardsville
he
whistle
again
will
he
i
think
so
but
i
speak
without
authority
there
an
idea
abroad
that
he
means
to
leave
the
valley
come
east
cross
the
mountains
himself
instead
of
my
crossing
them
what
do
you
think
of
that
i
am
not
in
his
council
sir
the
valley
people
would
hate
to
see
him
go
well
all
that
i
can
say
is
that
i
hope
banks
is
puzzled
too
jim
jim
damn
you
where
my
sword
and
sash
as
they
went
ewell
talked
on
in
his
piping
voice
general
jackson
must
fling
my
brigades
against
windmills
or
lose
them
in
the
mountains
i
fair
to
confess
i
feel
anxious
out
on
the
plains
when
we
chase
apaches
we
chase
we
do
go
deviating
like
a
love
vine
all
over
that
harry
hayes
band
playing
some
frenchy
thing
or
other
cavalry
over
there
i
know
you
got
ashby
but
flournoy
and
munford
are
right
wicked
too
the
virginia
is
with
you
sir
yes
fine
regiment
you
know
it
i
know
one
of
its
officers
major
stafford
oh
we
all
know
maury
stafford
fine
fellow
but
damned
restless
general
taylor
says
he
is
in
love
i
was
in
love
once
myself
but
i
do
remember
that
i
was
restless
he
is
he
was
with
loring
but
you
went
to
romney
together
yes
we
went
together
fine
fellow
but
unhappy
canker
somewhere
i
should
say
here
we
are
and
if
general
jackson
do
treat
my
army
well
i
i
i
know
he
crazy
the
review
was
at
last
over
back
under
the
wine
sap
ewell
wrote
his
answer
to
jackson
then
curled
in
a
remarkable
attitude
on
the
bench
beneath
the
tree
i
a
nervous
sir
ca
help
it
did
sleep
ca
sleep
put
cleave
through
a
catechism
searching
and
shrewd
his
piping
treble
voice
his
varied
oaths
and
quaintly
petulant
talk
his
roughness
of
rind
and
inner
sweetness
made
him
crumpled
under
the
apple
tree
in
his
grey
garb
and
cavalry
boots
with
his
bright
sash
and
bright
eyes
a
figure
mellow
and
olden
out
of
an
ancient
story
cleave
also
more
largely
built
more
muscular
a
little
taller
with
a
dark
thin
keen
face
the
face
of
a
thinking
clad
in
grey
clean
but
worn
seated
on
a
low
stool
beneath
the
tinted
boughs
his
sword
between
his
knees
his
hands
clasped
over
the
hilt
his
chin
on
his
hands

too
speaking
of
skirmishes
of
guns
and
horsemen
of
the
massed
enemy
of
mountain
passes
and
fordable
rivers
had
the
value
of
a
figure
from
a
flemish
or
venetian
canvas
the
form
of
the
moment
was
of
old
time
old
as
the
smell
of
apple
blossoms
or
the
buzzing
of
the
bees
old
as
these
and
yet
persistently
too
of
the
present
as
were
these
the
day
wore
on
to
afternoon
and
at
last
the
messenger
from
jackson
was
released
the
virginia
had
its
encampment
upon
the
edge
of
a
thick
and
venerable
wood

and
oak

and
hickory
regimental
headquarters
was
indeed
within
the
forest
half
a
dozen
tents
pitched
in
a
glade
sylvan
enough
for
robin
hood
here
cleave
found
stafford
sitting
writing
before
the
adjutant
tent
he
looked
up
laid
down
his
pen
and
rose
ah
where
did
you
come
from
i
thought
you
in
the
valley
in
training
for
a
brigadier
he
came
forward
holding
out
his
hand
i
am
glad
to
see
you
welcome
to
camp
ewell
cleave
hand
made
no
motion
from
his
side
thank
you
he
said
it
is
good
when
a
man
can
feel
that
he
is
truly
welcome
the
other
was
not
dull
nor
did
he
usually
travel
by
indirection
you
will
not
shake
hands
he
said
i
think
we
have
not
been
thrown
together
since
that
wretched
evening
at
bloomery
gap
do
you
bear
malice
for
that
do
you
think
that
i
do
the
other
shrugged
why
i
should
not
have
thought
so
what
is
it
then
let
us
go
where
we
can
speak
without
interruption
the
woods
down
there
they
moved
down
one
of
the
forest
aisles
the
earth
was
carpeted
with
dead
leaves
from
beneath
which
rose
the
wild
flowers
the
oak
was
putting
forth
tufts
of
rose
velvet
the
beech
a
veil
of
pale
and
satiny
green
the
sky
above
was
blue
but
the
sun
being
low
the
space
beneath
the
lacing
boughs
was
shadowy
enough
the
two
men
stopped
beside
the
bole
of
a
giant
beech
splashed
with
lichens
quiet
enough
here
said
stafford
well
what
is
it
richard
cleave
i
have
not
much
to
say
said
cleave
i
will
not
keep
you
many
moments
i
will
ask
you
to
recall
to
mind
the
evening
of
the
seventeenth
of
last
april
well
i
have
done
so
it
is
not
difficult
no
it
would
i
imagine
come
readily
upon
that
evening
maury
stafford
you
lied
to
me
i
do
said
cleave
why
should
you
make
it
worse
the
impression
which
that
evening
you
deliberately
gave
me
you
on
every
after
occasion
as
deliberately
strengthened
your
action
then
and
since
brands
you
sir
for
what
you
are
and
where
demanded
stafford
hoarsely
where
did
you
get
this
precious
information
or
misinformation
who
was
at
the
pains
to
persuade
you
no
hard
matter
i
warrant
that
i
was
dealing
falsely
your
informant
sir
was
mistaken
and
i
a
shaft
of
sunshine
striking
between
the
boughs

in
which
they
stood

a
hard
and
painful

did
she
tell
you
that
no
she
does

why
i
misunderstood
nor
shall

her
you

loves
you

is
going
to

you

very
quiet

up
among
the
boughs

leaned
against
the
trunk
of
the
beech
he
was
breathing
heavily
he
looked
veritably
a
wounded
man
i
will
go
now
said
cleave
i
had
to
speak
to
you
and
i
had
to
warn
you
he
turned
the
leaves
crisp
beneath
his
footfall
wait
said
stafford
one
moment
he
drew
himself
up
against
the
beech
i
wish
to
tell
you
why
i
as
you
phrase
it
lied
to
you
i
allowed
you
to
rest
under
that
impression
which
i
am
not
sure
that
i
myself
gave
you
because
i
thought
her
yet
trembling
between
us
and
that
your
withdrawal
would
be
advantageous
to
my
cause
not
for
all
of
heaven
would
i
have
had
her
turn
to
you
now
that
apparently
i
have
lost
her
irrevocably
i
will
tell
you
that
you
do
not
love
her
as
i
do
have
i
not
watched
you
did
she
die
you
would
go
on
with
your
for
me
i
would
kill
myself
on
her
grave
where
you
and
i
were
rivals
and
enemies
now
we
are
enemies
look
out
for
me
richard

began
to
laugh
a
broken
and
mirthless
sound

out
for
me
richard

i
shall
said
cleave
i
will
not
keep
a
watch
upon
you
in
such
a
moment
nor
remember
it
i
doubt
neither
your
passion
nor
your
suffering
but
in
one
thing
maury
stafford
you
have
lied
again
i
love
as
strongly
and
i
love
more
highly
than
you
do
as
for
your
threats

there

no

for
us
at
the
gap
the
general
just
behind
head
of
main
column
jerked
that
right
hand
of
his
into
the
air
sixteen
times
since
we
left
harrisonburg
day
before
yesterday
and
the
staff
says

most
powerful
done
a
little
praying

to
one
side

the
lord

want
too
to
speak
to

where

nice

and
gallantry
enough
for
a
dozen
i
tell

wish
you

me
swear

do
believe

responsible
it
is
in
the
least
like
his
usual
conduct
old
jack
backing
away
from
cannons
and
such
quitting
parade
ground
before

time
marching
off

little
sorrel
was
met
with
further
on
imperturbable
and
with
his
uniform
his
great
boots
his
dreadful
cap
he
exhibited
as
he
rode
a
demeanour
in
which
there
was
neither
heaviness
nor
lightness
never
jovial
seldom
genial
he
was
on
one
day
much
what
he
was
on
another
saving
always
battle
days
riding
with
his
steadfast
eyes
level
before
him
he
communed
with
himself
or
with
heaven
certainly
not
with
his
dissatisfied
troops
he
acknowledged
cleave
salute
and
took
the
letter
which
the
other
produced

questions

major
cleave
rode
back
to
the
presently
the
sun
now
brilliantly
up
the
army
of
the
valley
in
no
sunny
mood
crossed
the
bridge
over
the
shenandoah
there
was
a
short
halt
a
company
of
ashby
galloped
from
the
rear
and
drew
off
into
a
strip
of
level
beside
the
bridge
a
section
of
artillery
followed
suit
the
army
understood
that
for
some
reason
or
other
and
for
some
length
of
time
or
other
the
bridge
was
to
be
guarded
but
it
understood
nothing
more
presently
the
troops
passed
store
where
the
old
negro
reinforced
now
by
the
dozen
white
inhabitants
gaped
at
the
tramping
column
the
white
men
asked
stuttering
questions
and
as
the
situation
dawned
upon
them
they
indulged
in
irritating
comment
say
boys
where
in
the
lord
name

going
we
want
you
on
this
side
of
the
blue
ridge

leavin

he

on
sullen
and
sorry
the
army
marched
on
and
at
noon
came
to
elk
run
valley
on
the
edge
of
swift
run
gap
when
the
men
stacked
arms
and
broke
ranks
it
was
upon
the
supposition
that
dinner
over
they
would
resume
the
march
they
did
not
so
they
stayed
ten
days
in
elk
run
valley
all
around
were
the
mountains
heavily
timbered
bold
and
pathless
beyond
conrad
store
covering
jackson
front
rushed
the
shenandoah
the
bridge
guarded
by
ashby
men
there
were
pickets
enough
between
the
river
and
the
camp
north
south
and
east
rose
the
mountains
and
on
the
other
side
of
swift
run
gap
near
stanardsville
lay
ewell
and
his
eight
thousand
the
encampment
occupied
low
and
flat
ground
through
which
ran
a
swollen
creek
the
spring
had
been
on
the
whole
inclement
and
now
with
suddenness
winter
came
back
for
a
final
word
one
day
there
was
a
whirl
of
snow
another
was
cold
and
harsh
on
the
third
there
set
in
a
chilly
rain
it
rained
and
rained
and
all
the
mountain
streams
came
down
in
torrents
and
still
further
swelled
the
turbid
creek
one
night
about
halfway
through
their
stay
the
creek
came
out
of
its
banks
and
flooded
the
surrounding
land
all
tents
huts
and
shelters
of
boughs
for
a
hundred
feet
each
side
acquired
a
liquid
flooring
there
arose
an
outcry
on
the
midnight
air
wet
and
cursing
half
naked
and
all
men
disentangled
themselves
from
their
soaked
blankets
snatched
up
clothing
and
accoutrements
and
splashed
through
a
foot
of
icy
water
to
slightly
dryer
quarters
on
the
rising
ground
snow
rain
freeze
thaw
impatience
listlessness
rabid
conjecture
apathetic
acquiescence
quarrels
makeups
discomfort
ennui
a
deal
of
swearing
carefully
suppressed
around
headquarters
drill
whenever
practicable
two
sunday
services
and
one
prayer
meeting
the
last
week
of
april
in
elk
run
valley
was
one
to
be
forgotten
without
a
pang
there
was
an
old
barn
which
the
artillery
had
seized
upon
that
leaked
like
a
sieve
and
there
was
a
deserted
tannery
that
still
filled
the
air
with
an
evil
odour
and
there
was
change
of
pickets
and
there
were
couriers
to
be
observed
coming
and
going
never
anything
to
be
gotten
out
of
them
and
there
were
the
mountains
hung
with
grey
clouds
the
wood
was
always
wet
and
would
not
burn
coffee
was
so
low
that
it
was
served
only
every
other
day
besides
being
half
chicory
and
the
commissary
had
been
cheated
into
getting
a
lot
of
poor
tobacco
the
guardhouse
accommodated
more
men
than
usual
a
squad
of
ashby
brought
in
five
deserters
all
found
on
the
backward
road
to
the
valley
one
said
that
he
was
sick
and
that
his
mother
had
always
nursed
him
another
that
he
was
only
going
to
see
that
the
yankees
had
touched
the
farm
and
meant
to
come
right
back
another
that
the
war
was
over
anyhow
another
that
he
had
had
a
bad
dream
and
could
rest
until
he
saw
that
his
wife
was
alive
the
fifth
that
he
was
tired
of
living
and
the
sixth
said
nothing
at
all
jackson
had
the
six
put
in
irons
and
it
was
thought
that
after
the
court
martial
they
would
be
shot
on
the
ashby
from
the
other
side
of
the
shenandoah
made
a
demonstration
in
force
against
the
enemy
at
harrisonburg
and
the
next
day
encountering
the
federal
cavalry
drove
them
back
to
the
town
that
same
afternoon
the
army
of
the
valley
quitting
without
regret
elk
run
valley
found
itself
travelling
an
apparently
bottomless
road
that
wound
along
the
base
of
the
mountains
for
the
lord
sake
where
are
we
going
now
this
is
the
worst
road
to
port
republic
why
are
we
going
to
port
republic
boys
i
do
know
anyway
we
ai
going
through
the
gap
we
still
in
the
valley
by
gosh
i
heard
the
captain
give
some
mighty
good
guesses
going
to
ask
captain
what
d
ye
reckon
we
camped
ten
days
in
that
mud
hole
for
hairston
breckinridge
gave
the
question
consideration
well
tom
maybe
there
were
reasons
after
all
general
ewell
for
instance
he
could
have
joined
us
there
any
minute
they
say
he
going
to
take
our
place
at
elk
run
that
so
wish
him
joy
of
the
mud
hole
and
we
could
have
been
quickly
reinforced
from
richmond
general
banks
would
know
all
that
and
would
make
him
even
less
eager
than
he
seems
to
be
to
leave
the
beaten
way
and
come
east
himself
nobody
wants
you
know
on
the
other
side
of
the
blue
ridge
that
so
and
for
all
he
knew
if
he
moved
north
and
west
to
join
fremont
we
might
pile
out
and
strike
milroy
and
if
he
went
south
and
west
to
meet
milroy
he
might
hear
of
something
happening
to
fremont
that
so
and
if
he
moved
south
on
staunton
he
might
find
himself
caught
like
a
scalybark
in
a
nut
cracker
edward
johnson
on
one
side
and
the
army
of
the
valley
on
the
other
that
so
the
other
day
i
asked
major
cleave
if
general
jackson
never
amused
himself
in
any
way
never
played
any
game
chess
for
instance
he
said
at
all
which
was
lucky
for
the
other
chess
player
well
he
ought
to
know
for
he
a
mighty
good
chess
player
himself
and
you
think
i
think
general
banks
has
had
to
stay
where
he
is
and
where
are
we
going
now
besides
port
republic
i
have
any
idea
but
i
willing
to
bet
that
we
going
somewhere
the
dirt
roads
after
the
incessant
rains
were
mud
mud
mud
ordinarily
to
the
ankles
extraordinarily
to
the
knees
of
the
marching
infantry
the
wagon
train
moved
in
front
and
the
heavy
wheels
made
for
the
rest
a
track
something
like
christian
through
the
slough
of
despond
the
artillery
brought
up
the
rear
and
fared
worst
of
all
guns
and
caissons
slid
heavily
into
deep
mud
holes
the
horses
strained
poor
brutes
but
their
iron
charges
stuck
fast
the
drivers
used
whip
and
voice
the
officers
swore
there
arose
calls
for
sergeant
jordan
appearing
that
steed
tamer
picked
his
way
to
the
horses
heads
spoke
to
them
patted
them
and
in
a
reasonable
voice
said
get
up
they
did
it
and
the
train
dragged
on
to
the
next
bog
deeper
than
before
then
stuck
wheels
straining
teams
oaths
adjuration
at
last
sergeant
jordan
so
abominable
was
the
road
that
the
army
went
like
a
tortoise
a
mud
tortoise
twilight
found
it
little
more
than
five
miles
from
its
and
the
bivouac
that
night
was
by
the
comfortless
roadside
in
the
miry
bushes
with
fires
of
wet
wood
and
small
and
poor
rations
clouds
were
lowering
and
a
chilly
wind
fretted
the
forests
of
the
blue
ridge
around
one
of
the
dismal
smoky
fires
an
especially
dejected
mess
found
a
spokesman
with
a
vocabulary
rich
in
comminations
sh
breathed
one
of
the
ring
officer
coming
by
heard
you
too
williams
all
that
about
old
jack
a
figure
wrapped
in
a
cloak
passed
just
upon
the
rim
of
the
firelight
i
do
think
men
said
a
voice
that
you
are
in
a
position
to
judge
if
i
have
brought
you
by
this
road
it
is
for
your
own
good
he
passed
on
the
darkness
taking
him
day
dawned
as
best
it
might
through
grey
sheets
of
rain
breakfast
was
a
mockery
damp
hardtack
holding
the
centre
of
the
stage
a
very
few
men
had
cold
coffee
in
their
canteens
but
when
they
tried
to
heat
it
the
miserable
fire
went
out
on
marched
the
army
of
the
valley
in
and
out
of
the
great
mountains
on
the
worst
road
to
port
republic
road
surrounding
levels
and
had
somehow
lost
identity
one
was
like
the
other
and
none
had
any
bottom
each
gun
had
now
a
corps
of
pioneers
who
casting
stone
and
brushwood
into
the
morass
laboriously
built
a
road
for
the
piece
whole
companies
of
infantry
were
put
at
this
work
the
officers
helped
the
staff
dismounted
and
helped
the
commanding
general
was
encountered
a
log
on
his
shoulder
or
a
great
stone
in
his
hands
all
this
day
they
made
but
five
miles
and
at
night
they
slept
in
something
like
a
lake
with
a
gibing
wind
above
to
whisper
it
for
it
for
may
the
second
was
of
a
piece
with
may
the
first
on
the
morning
of
may
the
third
the
clouds
broke
and
the
sun
came
out
it
found
the
troops
bivouacked
just
east
of
the
village
of
port
republic
and
it
put
into
them
life
and
cheer
something
else
helped
and
that
was
the
fact
that
before
them
clear
and
shining
in
the
morning
light
stretched
not
the
neglected
mountain
road
they
had
been
travelling
but
a
fair
valley
road
the
road
to
staunton
jackson
and
his
staff
had
their
quarters
at
the
neighbouring
house
of
general
lewis
at
breakfast
one
of
the
ladies
remarked
that
the
staunton
road
was
in
good
condition
and
asked
the
guest
of
honour
how
long
it
would
take
the
army
to
march
the
eighteen
miles
is
that
the
exact
distance
asked
the
general
eighteen
miles
yes
sir
just
about
eighteen
you
should
get
there
should
you
not
by
night
you
are
fortunate
said
the
general
in
having
a
great
natural
curiosity
at
your
very
doors
i
have
long
wanted
to
see
weyers
cave
a
vast
cavern
like
that
hollowed
out
by
god
finger
hung
with
stalactites
with
shells
and
banners
of
stone
filled
with
sounding
aisles
run
through
by
dark
rivers
in
which
swim
blind
fish
how
wonderful
a
piece
of
his
handiwork
i
have
always
wished
to
see
it
the
more
so
that
my
wife
has
viewed
it
and
told
me
of
its
marvels
i
always
wish
madam
to
rest
my
eyes
where
my
wife
have
rested
the
bugles
ringing
fall
in
were
positively
sweet
to
the
ears
of
the
soldiers
of
the
valley
fall
in
with
pleasure
sir
eighteen
miles
what
eighteen
miles
when
you

home

fine
old
road

more
butterflies

damn
what

of
the
valley
says
milroy
is
within
ten
miles
of
staunton
and
banks
just
waiting
a
little
longer
before
he
pulls
up
stakes
at
harrisonburg
and
comes
down
the
pike
to
join
him
says
edward
johnson
ai
got
but
a
handful
and
that
the
staunton
women
are
hiding
their
silver

here
old
jack

to

back
to
goshen
one
cheer
ai
enough
cheers
for
general
jackson
jackson
stiffly
lifting
the
old
forage
cap
galloped
by
upon
little
sorrel
his
staff
behind
him
he
came
to
the
head
of
the
column
where
it
was
drawn
up
on
the
fair
road
leading
through
port
republic
south
and
west
to
staunton
close
on
the
eastern
horizon
rose
the
blue
ridge
to
this
side
turned
off
a
rougher
narrower
way
piercing
at
brown
gap
the
great
mountain
barrier
between
the
valley
and
piedmont
virginia
the
column
was
put
into
motion
the
troops
stepping
out
briskly
warm
and
lovely
was
the
sunshine
mildly
still
the
air
big
cherry
trees
were
in
bloom
by
the
wayside
there
was
a
buzzing
of
honey
bees
a
slow
fluttering
of
yellow
butterflies
above
the
fast
drying
mud
puddles
throughout
the
ranks
sounded
a
clearing
of
throats
it
was
evident
that
the
men
felt
like
singing
presently
would
sing
the
head
of
the
column
came
to
the
brown
gap
road
what
that
stony
old
road
asked
a
winchester
man
that
a
road
over
the
mountains
into
albemarle
thank
the
lord
march
it
rang
infernally
march
not
a
freight
boat
horn
winding
up
the
james
at
night
not
the
minie
long
screech
not
gabriel
trump
not
anything
could
have
sounded
at
this
moment
so
mournfully
in
the
ears
of
the
army
of
the
valley
it
wheeled
to
the
left
it
turned
its
back
to
the
valley
it
took
the
stony
road
to
brown
gap
it
deeply
tasted
the
spring
of
tragic
disappointment
the
road
climbed
and
climbed
through
the
brilliant
weather
spur
and
wall
the
blue
ridge
shimmered
in
may
greenery
was
wrapped
in
happy
light
and
in
sweet
odours
was
carpeted
with
wild
flowers
and
ecstatic
with
singing
birds
only
the
army
of
the
valley
was
melancholy
desperately
melancholy
here
and
there
through
openings
like
great
casements
in
the
foliage
wide
views
might
be
had
of
the
valley
they
were
leaving
town
and
farm
and
mill
with
turning
wheel
were
there
ploughed
land
and
wheat
fields
valley
roads
and
valley
orchards
green
hills
and
vales
and
noble
woods
all
the
great
vale
between
mountain
chains
two
hundred
miles
from
north
to
south
from
blue
ridge
to
alleghenies
the
men
looked
wistfully
with
grieved
children
faces
at
the
top
of
the
mountain
there
was
a
short
halt
the
pull
had
been
hard
enough
heavy
hearts
and
all
the
men
dropped
upon
the
earth
between
the
pine
trees
of
the
crest
for
the
most
part
they
lay
in
the
sullen
silence
with
which
they
had
climbed
some
put
their
heads
upon
their
arms
tilted
hat
or
cap
over
their
eyes
others
chewed
a
twig
or
stalk
of
grass
and
gazed
upon
the
valley
they
were
leaving
or
upon
the
vast
eastward
stretch
of
piedmont
visible
also
from
the
mountain
top
it
was
bright
and
quiet
up
here
above
the
world
the
sunshine
drew
out
the
strong
odour
of
the
pines
the
ground
was
dry
and
warm
it
should
have
been
a
pleasant
place
to
drowse
in
and
be
happy
but
the
valley
soldiers
were
not
happy
jackson
riding
by
a
recumbent
group
spoke
from
the
saddle
that
right
men
you
rest
all
over
lying
down
in
the
morning
this
group
had
cheered
him
loudly
now
it
saluted
in
a
genuine
bath
to
romney
silence
he
rode
by
imperturbable
his
chief
engineer
was
with
him
and
they
went
on
to
a
flat
rock
commanding
both
the
great
views
east
and
west
here
they
dismounted
and
between
them
unfurled
a
large
map
weighting
its
corners
with
pine
cones
the
soldiers
below
them
gazed
dully
old
jack
or
jackson
or
fool
tom
jackson
was
forever
looking
at
maps
it
was
a
trick
of
his
as
useless
as
saying
good
good
or
jerking
his
hand
in
the
air
in
that
old
way
that
evening
the
army
of
the
valley
slept
in
emerald
meadows
beside
meechum
river
in
albemarle
coming
down
the
mountain
it
had
caught
distant
glimpses
of
white
spirals
of
smoke
floating
from
the
overworked
engines
of
the
virginia
central
and
now
it
lay
near
a
small
country
station
and
there
on
the
switch
were
empty
cars
and
empty
cars
to
go
to
richmond
the
army
groaned
and
got
its
supper
took
out
its
pipe
and
began
though
reluctantly
enough
to
regard
the
situation
with
a
philosophic
eye
what
was
done
was
done
the
blue
ridge
lay
between
it
and
the
valley
and
after
all
old
joe
must
be
wanting
soldiers
pretty
badly
down
at
richmond
the
landscape
was
lovely
the
evening
tranquil
and
sweet
the
army
went
to
bed
early
and
went
in
a
frame
of
mind
approaching
resignation

its
old
hotel
its
stores
its

staunton
had
had
in
the
past
twelve
months
many
an
unwonted
throb
and
thrill
it
was
in
a
condition
of
genuine
dull
steady
anxiety
now
and
then
shot
through
by
a
fiercer
pang
there
had
been
in
town
a
number
of
sick
and
convalescent
soldiers
all
these
were
sent
several
days
before
eastward
across
the
mountains
in
the
place
were
public
and
military
stores
at
the
same
time
a

with
a
peremptory
order
those

where
they
staunton
grumbled
and
wondered
but
obeyed
and
now
the
evening
before
had
come
from
port
republic
eighteen
miles
toward
the
blue
ridge
a
breathless
boy
on
a
breathless
horse
with
tidings
that
jackson
was
at
last
and
finally
gone
from
the

had
crossed
at

moving
down
the

this
very
night
in
the
dark
of

west
on

reported
to

that

itself

at

time
the
pews
were
well
filled
chiefly
old
men
and
women
and
young
boys
the
singing
was
fervent
the
prayers
were
yet
more
so
the
people
prayed
very
humbly
and
heartily
for
their
confederacy
for
their
president
and
his
cabinet
and
for
congress
for
their
capital
so
endangered
for
their

and
their

benediction
pronounced
the
congregation
came
out
of
the
churchyards
in
time
to
greet
with
delight
not
unmixed
with
a
sense
of
the
pathos
of
it
certain
just
arrived
reinforcements
four
companies
of
virginia
military
institute
cadets
who
their

at

had
been

hovering
closer
excited
country
people
flocked
into
town
farmers
whose
sons
were
with
jackson
came
for
advice
from
leading
citizens
ought
they
to
bring
in
the
women
and
children
no
end
of
foreigners
with
the
blue
coats
and
foreigners
are
rough
customers
and
stock
better
drive
the
cows
up
into
the
mountains
and
hide
the
horses
tom
watson
says
they
awful
wanton
take
what
they
want
and
kill
the
rest
and
no
more
think

paying
says
too
they
burning

what
think
we
better
do
sir
there
were
dunkards
in
the
valley
who
refused
to
go
to
war
esteeming
it
a
sin
some
of
these
were
in
town
coming
in
on
horseback
or
in
their
wagons
and
bringing
wife
or
daughter
the
men
were
and
venerable
of
aspect
the
women
had
peaceful
quaker
faces
framed
by
the
prim
close
bonnet
of
their
peculiar
garb
these
quiet
folk
too
were
they
would
not
resist
evil
but
their
homes
and
barns
were
dear
to
their
hearts
by
rights
the
cadets
should
have
been
too
leg
weary
for
parade
but
if
staunton
and
the
young
ladies
wished
to
see
how
the
did
things
why
of
course
in
the
rich
afternoon
light
band
playing
major
smith
at
their
head
the
corps
of
defence
marched
down
the
street
toward
a
green
field

for
evolutions
with
it
on
either
sidewalk
went
the

at
large
specifically
the
supremely
happy
small

the
pretty

were
already
in
the
field
seated

skirted
beneath
the

locust
trees
home
guard
and
attendant
throng
neared
the

a
whistle
shrieked
down
the

shrieked
with
enormous
vigour
that
train
due

not
due
for
an
hour
always
late
then
better
halt
until
it
pulls
in
ca
imagine
the
engine
appeared
an
old
timer
of
the
virginia
central
excitedly
puffing
dark
smoke
straining
in
like
a
racer
to
the
goal
behind
it
cars
and

four
days
later
on
sitlington
hill
on
the
bull
pasture
mountain
thirty
miles
to
the
west
of
staunton
a
man
sat
at
nightfall
in
the
light
of
a
great
and
wrote
a
dispatch
to
his
government
there
waited
for
it
a
swift
rider
watching
the
stars
while
the
general
wrote
or
the
surgeons
lanterns
like
fireflies
wandering
up
and
down
the
long
green
slopes
where
the
litter
bearers
lifted
the
wounded
friend
and
foe
the
man
seated
on
the
log
wrote
with
slow
precision
a
long
dispatch
covering
several
pages
of
paper
then
he
read
it
over
and
then
he
looked
for
a
minute
or
two
at
the
flitting
lanterns
and
then
he
slowly
tore
the
dispatch
in
two
and
fed
the
fire
with
the
pieces
the
courier
watching
him
write
a
much
shorter
message
half
put
forth
his
hand
to
take
it
for
his
horse
whinnied
upon
the
road
far
below
and
the
way
to
staunton
was
long
and
dark
however
jackson
eyes
again
dwelt
on
the
grey
slopes
before
him
and
on
the
alleghenies
visited
by
stars
and
then
as
slowly
as
before
he
tore
this
dispatch
also
across
and
across
and
dropped
the
pieces
on
the
brands
when
they
were
burned
he
wrote
a
single
line
signed
and
folded
it
and
gave
it
to
the
courier
the
latter
in
the
first
pink
light
in
the
midst
of
a
jubilant
staunton
read
it
to
the
excited
operator
in
the
little
telegraph

thank
you
said
allan
i
reckon
just
so
long
as
there
are
such
women
in
the
valley
there
be
men
there
too
you
all
surely
done
your
share
now
you
got
the
pot
of
apple
butter
and
the
bucket
with
the
honeycomb
and
the
piece
of
bacon
and
the
light
bread
if
you
come
a
little
earlier
i
could
have
let
you
have
some
eggs
i
got
a
feast
for
a
all
these
fighting
men
going
up
and
down
the
valley
are
going
to
eat
you
out
of
house
and
i
got
some
pay
two
months
ago
and
i
enough
left
to
make
it
fairer
he
drew
out
a
confederate
note
the
woman
on
the
doorstep
looked
at
it
admiringly
and
taking
it
from
him
examined
either
side
they
make
them
pretty
as
a
picture
she
said
i
was
in
richmond
and
saw
the
capitol
that
a
good
picture
of
it
and
that
statue
of
general
washington
my
his
horse
just
dancing
as
they
say
ashby
does
to
music
one
of
those
bronze
men
around
the
base
is
a
forbear
of
mine
she
gave
back
the
note
i
had
a
little
mite
of
real
coffee
that
have
liked
to
give
you
but
it
all
gone
howsoever
you
wo
go
hungry
with
what
you
got
have
you
a
nice
place
to
sleep
in
the
nicest
in
the
world
a
bed
of
oak
leaves
and
a
roof
all
stars
you
could
stay
here
i
got
a
spare
room
you
just
as
good
as
gold
said
allan
but
i
want
to
be
out
where
i
can
hear
the
news
i
a
scout
you
see
i
thought
that
watching
you
come
up
the
path
we
learning
fast
used
to
be
i
just
thought
a
soldier
was
a
soldier
i
never
thought
of
there
being
different
kinds
do
you
think
the
army
come
this
way
i
should
be
surprised
said
allan
indeed
i
rather
expecting
it
but
you
never
know
how
many
of
your
people
are
in
it
a
lot
of
cousins
but
my
sons
are
with
johnston
richmond
a
hundred
miles
away
i
reckon
but
all
last
night
i
thought
i
heard
the
cannon
well
i
mighty
glad
to
see
you
all
again
in
the
valley
be
sure
to
come
back
for
your
breakfast
and
if
the
army
passes
i
got
enough
for
one
or
two
besides
god
bless
you
allan
left
behind
the
small
brick
farmhouse
stopped
for
a
drink
at
the
spring
then
climbed
a
rail
fence
and
made
across
a
rolling
field
of
bright
green
clover
to
a
width
of
blossoming
woods
beyond
which
ran
the
mt
solon
and
bridgewater
road
from
the
forest
issued
a
curl
of
blue
vapour
and
a
smell
of
wood
smoke
the
scout
entering
found
a
cheerful
unnecessarily
large
fire
stretched
beside
it
upon
the
carpet
of
last
year
leaves
lay
billy
maydew
for
whose
company
he
had
applied
upon
quitting
a
week
before
the
army
between
mcdowell
and
franklin
allan
snuffed
the
air
you
build
too
big
a
fire
billy
is
a
good
scout
way
of
doing
billy
laid
down
horizontally
upon
the
leaves
the
stick
he
had
been
whittling
thar
ai
anybody
but
home
folks
to
smell
it
did
we
see
ashby
on
the
black
stallion
draw
a
line
like
that
thar
stick
across
the
valley
with
a
picket
post
for
every
knot
he
sat
up
did
you
get
anything
to
eat
i
certainly
did
there
surely
are
good
women
in
the
land
allan
disburdened
himself
rake
the
coals
out
and
get
the
skillet
afterwards
they
lay
prone
upon
the
leaves
and
talked
they
had
much
of
life
in
common
they
were
as
at
home
with
each
other
as
two
squirrels
frequenting
the
same
tree
now
as
they
lay
beneath
two
clouds
from
two
they
dwelt
for
some
time
upon
thunder
run
then
from
that
delectable
region
turned
to
the
here
and
now
allan
had
taught
billy
finding
him
a
most
unsatisfactory
pupil
billy
had
in
those
days
acquired
little
book
learning
but
a
very
real
respect
for
the
blond
giant
now
lying
opposite
to
him
since
coming
to
the
army
he
had
been
led
to
deplore
his
deficiencies
and
a
week
ago
he
had
suggested
to
allan
that
in
the
interim
of
active
scouting
the
latter
should
continue
his
education
when
thar
air
a
chance
i
want
to
swap
into
the
artillery
three
bands
of
red
thar
he
drew
a
long
finger
across
his
sleeve
air
my
ambition
i
reckon
then
christianna
and
all
the
thunder
run
girls
would
stop
saying
they
say
maydew
an
artillery
sergeant
got
to
be
head
in
ciphering
and
he
got
to
be
able
to
read
words
of
mor
one
one
syllable
that
it
now
they
are
any
printed
books
hereabouts
but
you
got
it
all
in
your
head
i
ca
teach
you
much
allan
had
said
soberly
whispering
under
bushes
and
listening
for
schenck
cavalry
we
might
do
something
though
you
were
an
awful
poor
speller
spell
now
now
in
the
week
billy
had
made
progress
more
progress
than
in
a
session
on
thunder
run
now
lying
in
the
woods
a
little
west
of
mt
solon
waiting
for
the
army
moving
back
to
the
valley
this
time
from
the
west
from
the
allegheny
fastnesses
he
accomplished
with
eclat
some
oral
arithmetic
if
two
yankee
parrotts
are
fired
every
eight
minutes
and
in
our
battery
we
serve
the
howitzer
every
nine
minutes
the
napoleon
every
ten
the
two
every
eleven
and
if
the
yankees
limber
up
and
leave
at
the
end
of
an
hour
how
many
shells
will
have
been
thrown
if
it
is
a
hundred
and
ten
miles
from
harrisonburg
to
the
potomac
and
if
old
jack
foot
cavalry
advances
miles
a
day
and
if
we
lay
off
a
day
for
a
battle
and
if
we
have
three
skirmishes
each
occupying
two
hours
and
if
banks
makes
a
stand
of
half
a
day
at
winchester
and
if
fremont
executes
a
flank
movement
and
delays
us
six
hours
just
how
long
will
it
be
before
old
jack
pushes
banks
into
the
potomac
if
company
a
had
ninety
men
when
it
started
war
a
full
hundred
and
five
men
died
of
measles
and
pneumonia
were
six
and
if
we
recruited
three
at
falling
springs
and
six
were
killed
at
manassas
and
sixteen
wounded
half
of
whom
never
came
back
and
we
got
twelve
recruits
at
centreville
and
seven
more
at
winchester
and
if
five
straggled
on
the
bath
and
romney
trip
and

and
if

and
if
ten
more

and
if
we
left
four
sick
at
magaheysville
and
if
we
lost
none
at
mcdowell
not
being
engaged
but
two
in
a
skirmish
since
and
if
steve
dagg
straggled
three
times
but
was
brought
back
and
tried
to
desert
twice
but
never
got
any
further
than
the
guardhouse
how
many
men
are
in
company
a
if
this
was
billy
if
i
have
any
luck
in
the
next
battle
and
if
i
air
found
to
have
a
speaking
acquaintance
with
every
damned
word
the
captain
asks
me
about
and
i
get
to
be
a
sergeant
and
i
air
swapped
into
the
artillery
and
thar
a
big
fight
and
my
battery
and
company
a
are
near
and
sergeant
mathew
coffin
gets
into
trouble
right
next
door
to
me
and
he
cried
out
a
hundred
times
lying
right
thar
in
the
zone
of
fire
come
take
me
out
of
hell
and
the
company
all
was
forced
back
and
all
the
gunners
and
i
was
left
thar
serving
my
gun
just
as
pretty
and
straight
and
he
cried
out
hundred
times
maydew
come
pick
me
up
and
carry
me
out
of
hell
and
i
just
served
on
a
hundred
times
only
looking
at
him
every
time
the
gun
thundered
and
i
straightened
up
for
shame
cried
allan
i
heard
steve
dagg
say
something
like
that
about
richard
cleave
billy
sat
up
indignant
it
air
not
like
that
at
all
the
major
air
what
he
is
and
steve
dagg
air
what
he
is
sergeant
mathew
coffin
air
what
somebody
or
other
called
somebody
else
in
that
thar
old
history
book
you
used
to
make
us
learn
he
air
petty
tyrant
he
air
that
and
thunder
run
do
like
that
kind
he
air
not
going
to
tyrannize
much
longer
over
billy
maydew
and
do
you
be
comparing
me
to
steve
dagg
i
ai
like
that
and
i
never
was
he
lay
prone
again
insulted
and
would
not
go
on
with
the
lesson
allan
took
it
calmly
made
a
placating
remark
or
two
and
lapsed
into
a
friendly
silence
it
was
pleasant
in
the
woods
where
the
birds
flitted
to
and
fro
and
the
pink
honeysuckle
grew
around
and
from
a
safe
distance
a
chipmunk
daintily
watched
the
intruders
the
scout
lay
drowsily
happy
the
sunshine
making
spun
gold
of
his
hair
and
beard
his
carbine
resting
near
back
on
thunder
run
at
the
moment
christianna
in
her
pink
sunbonnet
a
pansy
from
the
tollgate
at
her
throat
rested
upon
her
hoe
in
the
garden
she
was
making
and
looked
out
over
the
great
sea
of
mountains
visible
from
the
thunder
run
eyrie
shadows
of
clouds
moved
over
them
then
the
sun
shone
out
and
they
lay
beneath
in
an
amethystine
dream
christianna
had
had
her
dream
the
night
before
in
her
sleep
she
had
come
upon
a
dark
pool
beneath
alders
and
she
had
knelt
upon
the
black
bank
and
plunged
her
arms
to
the
shoulders
into
the
water
it
seemed
in
her
dream
that
there
was
something
at
the
bottom
that
she
wanted
a
breastpin
or
a
piece
of
money
and
she
had
drawn
up
something
that
weighed
heavily
and
filled
her
arms
when
she
had
lifted
it
halfway
out
of
the
water
the
moon
came
out
and
it
was
allan
gold
she
stood
now
in
her
steep
mountain
garden
bordered
with
phlox
and
larkspur
and
looked
far
out
over
the
long
and
many
ridges
she
knew
in
which
general
direction
to
look
and
with
her
mind
eye
she
tried
to
see
the
fighting
men
the
fighting
men
and
then
she
shook
her
head
and
bent
to
her
hoeing
far
back
and
high
up
on
thunder
run
thirty
leagues
away
in
the
flowering
wood
by
the
mt
solon
road
allan
sat
up
i
was
nearly
asleep
he
said
back
on
the
above
thunder
run
he
listened
horses
hoofs
a
squad
at
a
trot
coming
east
some
of
ashby
of
course
but
you
stay
here
and
put
earth
on
the
fire
while
i
take
a
look
rifle
in
hand
he
threaded
the
thick
undergrowth
between
the
camp
and
the
road
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
but
the
road
lay
yet
in
sunshine
between
the
clover
and
the
wheat
the
bloomy
orchards
and
the
woods
of
may
allan
precautions
had
been
largely
instinctive
there
were
no
federals
he
had
reason
to
be
sure
south
of
strasburg
he
looked
to
see
some
changing
picket
post
of
ashby
but
the
five
horsemen
who
came
in
sight
three
riding
abreast
two
a
little
behind
had
not
a
valley
air
tidewater
men
said
allan
to
himself
how
far
is
it
to
swift
run
gap
should
wonder
if
general
ewell
a
minute
later
the
party
came
in
line
with
the
woods
allan
after
another
deliberate
look
stepped
from
behind
a
flowering
thorn
the
party
drew
up
my
man
said
the
stars
and
wreath
in
the
centre
in
a
high
piping
voice
alone
are
you
ai
straggling
i
hope
far
too
many
stragglers
curse

this
service
civilians

armies
before
him
and
only
a
handful
gallop
across
and
find
out
the
crazy
man

says
the
in
the
middle
he
turned
with
the
suddenness
of
a
bird
to
allan
by
god
i
hungry
as
a
coyote
have
you
got
anything
to
eat
i
some
bread
and
bacon
and
a
few
eggs

a
pot

piece
of
honeycomb
sir

foster
brother

though
there

enough
for
four
deane
and
edmondson
you
ride
on
to
that
mill
i
see
in
front
of
us
and
ask
if
the
folks
wo
give
you
supper
we
pick
you
up
in
an
hour
or
so
now
my
friend
in
need
we
build
a
fire
and
if
got
a
skillet
i
show
you
how
an
omelette
ought
to
be
made
and
generally
is
within
the
covert
billy
made
up
the
fire
again
and
general
ewell
beneath
the
amused
eyes
of
his
aides
sliced
bacon
broke
eggs
into
the
skillet
and
produced
an
omelette
which
was
a
triumph
he
was
in
truth
a
master
cook
and
everything
was
good
and
savoury
and
the
trio
was
very
hungry
ewell
had
cigars
and
smoked
them
like
a
spaniard
generous
too
giving
freely
to
the
others
as
often
as
it
burned
low
billy
threw
dried
sticks
upon
the
fire
the
evening
was
cool
the
shadows
advancing
the
crackling
light
and
warmth
grateful
enough
the
newcomers
asked
questions
they
were
eager
to
know
all
the
country
was
to
know
of
events
were
duly
appreciated
the
scout
had
been
at
mcdowell
yes
but
not
in
the
battle
the
stonewall
brigade
not
being
engaged
georgia
did
best
and
the
virginia
georgia
held
the
crest
there
was
one
man
just
a
boy
like
billy
there
eighteen
from
billy
could
anybody
keep
him
back
behind
the
rise
where
our
troops
were
lying
down
did
come
all
this
way
to
hide
from
yankees
he
cried
and
he
rushed
out
and
down
upon
them
poor
fellow
that
the
spirit
in
the
morning
you
followed
on
yes
but
milroy
and
schenck
did
not
do
badly
that
was
a
good
fetch
of
theirs
firing
the
forest
everywhere
a
great
murk
with
tongues
of
flame
smoke
in
nostril
and
eyes
and
the
wind
blowing
fast
it
looked
like
the
end
of
the
world
old
jack
beg
pardon
sir
general
jackson
general
jackson
could
but
smile
it
was
such
excellent
tactics
we
drew
off
at
last
near
franklin
and
the
army
went
into
camp
for
a
bit
billy
and
i
have
been
with
a
squadron
of
ashby
keeping
fremont
back
yes
general
jackson
wanted
the
passes
blocked
we
did
it
pretty
thoroughly
how
burned
all
the
bridges
cut
down
trees
in
one
place
a
mile
of
them
and
made
abatis
toppled
boulders
over
the
cliffs
and
choked
the
roads
if
fremont
wants
to
get
through
he
have
to
go
round
robin
hood
barn
to
do
it
he
out
of
the
counting
for
awhile
i
reckon
at
least
he
wo
interfere
with
our
communications
ashby
has
three
companies
toward
the
mountains
he
picketed
the
valley
straight
across
below
woodstock
banks
ca
get
even
a
spy
through
from
strasburg
heard
an
officer
say
you
know
him
major
stafford
major
cleave
heard
him
say
that
general
jackson
uses
cavalry
as
napoleon
did
and
as
no
one
has
done
since
ewell
lit
another
cigar
well
i
free
to
confess
that
old
jackson
is
as
crazy
as
an
idiot
called
dick
ewell
thought
him
as
milton
says
method
in
his
madness
shakespeare
was
it
morris
do
read
much
out
on
the
plains
the
younger
aide
had
been
gleeful
throughout
the
recital
stonewall
a
good
name
by
george
but
by
george
they
ought
to
call
him
the
artful
dodger
maury
stafford
burst
into
laughter
by
heaven
morris
you
better
tell
him
that
have
you
ever
seen
him
no
they
say
he
real
pious
and
as
simple
as
they
make
them
but
lord
there
has
been
anything
simple
about
his
late
proceedings
stafford
laughed
again
religious
as
cromwell
and
artless
as
macchiavelli
begins
his
orders
with
an
honourable
mention
of
god
closes
them
with
all
deserters
in
irons
and
in
between
gives
points
to
reynard
the
fox
ewell
took
his
cigar
from
his
lips
do
be
so
damned
sarcastic
maury
it
worse
than
drink
well
deane
one
of
his
troopers
had
appeared
a
courier
has
arrived
general
with
a
letter
from
general
jackson
i
left
him
at
the
mill
and
came
back
to
report
there
a
nice
little
office
there
with
a
light
and
writing
materials
dusk
filled
the
forest
the
night
came
and
the
stars
shone
between
the
branches
a
large
white
moon
uprose
and
made
the
neighbouring
road
a
milky
ribbon
stretched
east
and
west
a
zephyr
just
stirred
the
myriad
leaves
somewhere
deeper
in
the
woods
an
owl
hooted
at
intervals
very
solemnly
billy
heaped
wood
upon
the
fire
laid
his
gun
carefully
just
so
stretched
himself
beside
it
and
in
three
minutes
reached
the
deepest
basin
of
sleep
allan
sat
with
his
back
to
the
hickory
and
the
firelight
falling
upon
the
leaves
of
a
book
he
had
borrowed
from
some
student
in
the
ranks
it
was
a
volume
of
shelley
and
the
young
man
read
with
serious
appreciation
he
was
a
lover
of
poetry
and
he
was
glad
to
meet
with
this
poet
whose
works
he
had
not
been
able
as
yet
to
put
upon
his
back
in
the
little
room
under
the
eaves
of
the
tollgate
he
read
on
bent
forward
the
firelight
upon
his
ample
frame
gold
of
hair
and
beard
and
barrel
of
the
musket
lying
on
the
leaves
beside
him
o
love
who
bewailest
the
frailty
of
all
things
here
why
choose
you
the
frailest
for
your
cradle
your
home
and
your
bier
allan
made
the
fire
yet
brighter
listened
a
moment
to
the
hooting
of
the
owl
then
read
on
its
passions
will
rock
thee
as
the
storms
rock
the
ravens
on
high
bright
reason
will
mock
thee
he
ceased
to
read
turning
his
head
for
he
heard
a
horse
upon
the
road
coming
from
the
direction
of
the
mill
it
came
slowly
with
much
of
weariness
in
the
very
hoof
sounds
then
left
the
road
for
the
woodside
and
stopped
ensued
a
pause
while
the
rider
fastened
it
to
some
sapling
then
through
the
bushes
the
former
came
toward
the
he
proved
to
be
maury
stafford
the
courier
says
general
jackson
will
reach
mt
solon
about
midnight
general
ewell
is
getting
an
hour
sleep
at
the
mill
i
am
not
sleepy
and
your
fire
is
attractive
may
i
keep
you
company
for
awhile
allan
was
entirely
hospitable
certainly
sir
spread
your
cloak
just
there
the
wind
will
blow
the
smoke
the
other
way
well
we
all
be
glad
to
see
the
army
what
are
you
reading
allan
showed
him
humph
its
passions
will
rock
thee
as
the
storms
rock
the
ravens
on
high
bright
reason
will
mock
thee
well
we
all
know
the
man
was
a
seer
he
laid
the
book
down
upon
the
grey
cloak
lined
with
red
and
sat
with
his
chin
in
his
hand
staring
at
the
fire
some
moments
elapsed
before
he
spoke
then
you
have
known
richard
cleave
for
a
long
time
yes
ever
since
we
were
both
younger
than
we
are
now
i
like
him
better
than
any
one
i
know
and
i
think
he
fond
of
me
he
seems
to
have
warm
friends
he
has
he
true
as
steel
and
he
in
and
out
a
little
clumsily
simple
sometimes
do
you
not
think
lawyer
and
soldier
grafted
on
piers
ploughman
and
the
seams
not
well
hidden
i
would
say
there
a
lack
of
grace
i
have
not
noticed
it
said
allan
dryly
he
a
very
good
leader
the
other
smiled
though
only
with
the
lips
oh
i
am
not
decrying
him
why
should
i
i
have
heard
excellent
things
of
him
he
is
a
favourite
is
he
not
with
general
jackson
i
do
think
that
general
jackson
has
favourites
at
least
he
is
no
longer
in
disfavour
i
remember
toward
the
close
of
the
romney
expedition
oh
that
said
allan
that
was
nothing
he
put
down
his
pipe
let
me
see
if
i
can
explain
to
you
the
ways
of
this
army
you
do
know
general
jackson
as
we
do
who
have
been
with
him
ever
since
a
year
ago
and
harper
ferry
in
any
number
of
things
he
as
gentle
as
a
woman
in
a
few
others
he
is
in
some
things
he
like
iron
he
rigid
in
his
discipline
and
he
tolerate
no
shade
of
insubordination
or
disobedience
or
neglect
of
duty
he
got
the
defect
of
his
quality
and
sometimes
he
see
those
things
where
they
are
not
he
understand
making
allowances
or
forgiving
he
rebuke
a
man
in
general
orders
hold
him
up
if
he
an
officer
before
the
troops
and
all
for
something
that
another
general
would
hardly
notice
he
make
an
officer
march
without
his
sword
for
whole
days
in
the
rear
of
his
regiment
and
all
for
something
that
just
a
reprimand
would
have
done
for
as
you
say
he
made
the
very
man
we
talking
of
do
that
from
bloomery
gap
to
romney
and
nobody
ever
knew
why
just
the
other
day
there
were
some
poor
fools
of
men
in
one
of
our
regiments
who
concluded
they
did
want
to
reenlist
they
said
they
go
home
and
cried
out
for
their
discharge
and
they
had
forgotten
all
about
the
conscription
act
that
congress
had
just
passed
so
when
the
discharge
was
refused
they
got
dreadfully
angry
and
threw
down
their
arms
the
colonel
went
to
the
general
and
the
general
almost
put
him
under
arrest
does
colonel
grigsby
come
to
me
to
learn
how
to
deal
with
mutineers
shoot
them
where
they
stand
kernstown
too
there
hardly
a
man
of
the
stonewall
that
does
think
general
garnett
justified
in
ordering
that
retreat
and
yet
look
at
garnett
under
arrest
and
the
commanding
general
preferring
charges
against
him
says
he
did
not
wait
for
orders
lost
the
battle
and
so
on
with
garnett
it
is
a
deadly
serious
matter
rank
and
fame
and
name
for
courage
all
in
peril
i
see
but
with
richard
cleave
it
was
not
serious
not
in
the
least
these
smaller
arrests
and
censures
not
even
the
best
can
avoid
them
i
should
think
they
were
pleasant
for
sometimes
they
are
mentioned
in
reports
and
sometimes
they
get
home
to
the
womenfolk
but
his
officers
understand
him
by
now
and
they
keep
good
discipline
and
they
had
rather
be
led
by
stonewall
jackson
than
by
an
easier
man
as
for
richard
cleave
i
was
with
him
on
the
march
to
mcdowell
and
he
looked
a
happy
man
ah
the
conversation
dropped
the
scout
having
said
his
say
easily
relapsed
into
silence
his
visitor
half
reclining
upon
his
cloak
beneath
an
old
gnarled
tree
was
still
the
firelight
played
strangely
over
his
face
for
now
it
seemed
the
face
of
one
man
now
that
of
another
in
the
one
aspect
he
looked
intent
as
though
in
his
mind
he
mapped
a
course
in
the
other
he
showed
only
weariness
dashed
with
something
tragic
a
handsome
brooding
melancholy
face
they
stayed
like
this
for
some
time
the
fire
burning
before
them
the
moon
flooding
the
forest
the
owl
hooting
from
his
hole
in
some
decaying
tree
at
last
however
another
sound
intruded
a
very
low
subdued
sound
like
a
distant
ground
swell
or
like
thunder
without
resonance
it
grew
dull
yet
it
became
deep
allan
knocked
the
ashes
from
his
pipe
that
is
a
sound
he
said
that
when
you
have
once
heard
you
do
forget
the
army
coming
stafford
rose
i
must
get
back
to
general
ewell
thank
you
gold
for
your
hospitality
not
at
all
not
at
all
said
allan
heartily
i
am
glad
that
i
could
put
that
matter
straight
for
you
it
would
blight
like
black
frost
to
have
stonewall
jackson
hand
and
mind
set
against
you
and
richard
cleave
is
not
the
least
in
that
predicament
the
army
of
the
valley
advance
and
main
column
and
rearguard
artillery
and
wagon
train
came
down
the
road
having
marched
twenty
miles
since
high
noon
on
either
hand
stretched
pleasant
pastures
a
running
stream
fair
woods
company
by
company
the
men
left
the
road
were
halted
stacked
arms
broke
ranks
cessation
from
motion
was
sweet
sweet
the
feel
of
turf
beneath
their
feet
they
had
had
supper
three
hours
before
now
they
wanted
sleep
and
without
much
previous
ado
they
lay
down
and
took
it
stonewall
jackson
foot
cavalry
sleeping
under
the
round
moon
by
mt
solon
at
the
mill
there
was
a
meeting
and
a
conference
a
figure
in
an
old
cloak
and
a
shabby
forage
cap
dismounted
ungracefully
enough
from
a
tired
nag
and
crossed
the
uncovered
porch
to
the
wide
mill
door
there
he
was
met
by
his
future
trusty
and
trusted
lieutenant
dear
dick
ewell
jackson
greeting
was
simple
to
baldness
ewell
had
the
precision
of
a
captain
of
dragoons
together
they
entered
the
small
mill
office
where
the
aides
placed
lights
and
writing
materials
then
withdrew
the
generals
sat
down
one
on
this
side
of
the
deal
table
one
on
that
jackson
took
from
his
pocket
a
lemon
very
deliberately
opened
a
knife
and
cutting
the
fruit
in
two
put
one
half
of
the
sour
treasure
to
his
lips
ewell
fidgeted
then
as
the
other
sucked
on
determined
to
set
the
ball
rolling
damn
me
general
if
i
am
not
glad
to
have
the
pleasure
at
last
jackson
sent
across
the
table
a
glance
then
gently
put
down
one
half
of
the
lemon
and
took
up
the
other
why
the
deuce
should
he
look
at
me
in
that
damned
reproachful
fashion
thought
ewell
he
made
another
start
there
a
damned
of
advices
from
richmond
i
hate
uncertainty
like
the
devil
and
so
i
thought
i
ride
across
general
ewell
said
jackson
gently
you
will
oblige
me
by
not
swearing
profanity
sir
is
most
distasteful
to
me
now
you
rode
across
ewell
swallowed
rode
across
rode
across
i
rode
across
sir
from
swift
run
gap
and
i
brought
with
me
two
late
dispatches
from
general
johnston
and
general
lee
i
thought
some
expression
perhaps
to
them
of
your
opinion
following
the
late
victory
and
all
the
other
took
and
read
laid
down
the
dispatches
and
applied
himself
to
his
lemon
presently
i
will
telegraph
to
general
johnston
and
general
lee
i
shall
advise
that
you
enter
the
valley
as
first
intended
as
for
richmond
we
may
best
serve
richmond
by
threatening
washington
threatening
washington
at
present
you
are
in
my
district
and
form
part
of
my
command
you
will
at
once
move
your
troops
forward
a
day
march
upon
receipt
of
advices
from
general
johnston
and
general
lee
and
if
they
are
of
the
tenour
i
expect
you
will
move
with
promptness
to
luray
and
then
with
promptness
to
luray
i
strongly
value
swiftness
of
movement
i
understand
that
sir
double
the
distance
in
half
the
time
good
when
instructions
are
given
it
is
desirable
that
those
instructions
be
followed
i
assume
the
responsibility
of
giving
the
proper
instructions
i
understand
general
obey
and
ask
no
questions
just
so
be
careful
of
your
ammunition
wagons
but
otherwise
as
little
impedimenta
as
possible
i
understand
sir
the
road
to
glory
can
not
be
followed
with
much
baggage
jackson
put
out
his
long
arm
and
gently
touched
the
other
hand
good
i
should
be
surprised
if
we
did
get
on
very
well
together
now
i
will
write
a
telegram
to
general
lee
and
then
you
shall
get
back
to
swift
run
gap
the
fewer
hours
a
general
is
away
from
his
troops
the
better
he
rose
and
opened
the
door
lieutenant
meade
the
aide
appeared
send
me
a
courier
the
one
with
the
freshest
horse
order
general
ewell
horses
to
be
saddled
this
was
the
seventeenth
two
days
later
the
army
of
the
valley
moving
down
the
valley
pike
in
a
beautiful
confidence
that
it
was
hurling
itself
against
banks
at
strasburg
swerved
to
the
east
about
new
market
with
a
suddenness
that
made
it
dizzy
straight
across
its
path
now
ran
the
strange
and
bold
wall
of
the
massanuttons
architectural
freak
of
nature
planted
midway
of
the
smiling
valley
the
army
groaned
always
climbing
mountains
this
time
i
reckon
we
climb
it
back
again
nothing
over
on
the
other
side
but
the
luray
valley
up
and
up
went
the
army
through
luxuriant
forests
where
the
laurel
was
in
bloom
by
the
cool
dash
of
mountain
waters
past
haunts
of
stag
and
doe
through
fern
over
pine
needles
under
azure
sky
then
down
it
sank
long
winding
after
winding
moss
and
fern
and
richest
forest
here
velvet
shadow
there
highest
light
down
and
down
to
the
lovely
luray
valley
to
the
crossing
of
the
shenandoah
to
green
meadows
and
the
bugles
ringing
halt
how
short
the
time
between
tattoo
and
reveille
the
dawn
was
rosy
still
not
cold
the
river
running
near
the
men
with
leave
to
rid
themselves
of
the
dust
of
yesterday
long
march
in
they
plunged
all
along
the
south
fork
of
the
shenandoah
into
the
cool
and
wholesome
flood
there
were
laughters
shoutings
games
of
dolphins
then
out
they
came
and
while
they
cooked
their
breakfasts
they
heard
the
drums
and
fifes
of
ewell
eight
thousand
marching
down
from
conrad
store
the
night
before
at
washington
where
there
was
much
security
and
much
triumph
over
the
fall
of
richmond
the
secretary
of
war
received
a
dispatch
from
general
banks
at
strasburg
in
the
valley
of
virginia
thirty
miles
from
winchester
my
force
at
strasburg
is
infantry
two
brigades
cavalry
parrott
guns
and
smoothbore
pieces
i
have
on
the
manassas
gap
railroad
between
strasburg
and
manassas
infantry
companies
cavalry
and
pieces
artillery
there
are
companies
cavalry
first
maine
near
strasburg
of
the
enemy
i
received
information
last
night
direct
from
new
market
that
jackson
has
returned
to
within
miles
of
harrisonburg
west
i
have
no
doubt
that
force
is
near
harrisonburg
and
that
ewell
still
remains
at
swift
run
gap
i
shall
communicate
more
at
length
the
condition
of
affairs
and
the
probable
plans
of
the
enemy
in
pursuance
of
his
promise
general
banks
wrote
at
length
from
strasburg
the
evening
of
the
sir
the
return
of
the
rebel
forces
of
general
jackson
to
the
valley
after
his
forced
march
against
generals
milroy
and
schenck
increases
my
anxiety
for
the
safety
of
the
position
i
occupy
that
he
has
returned
there
can
be
no
doubt
from
all
the
information
i
can
gather
and
i
do
not
wish
to
excite
alarm
unnecessarily
i
am
compelled
to
believe
that
he
meditates
attack
here
i
regard
it
as
certain
that
he
will
move
north
as
far
as
new
market
a
position
which
enables
him
also
to
cooperate
with
general
ewell
who
is
still
at
swift
run
gap
once
at
new
market
they
are
within
miles
of
strasburg
i
have
forborne
until
the
last
moment
to
make
this
representation
well
knowing
how
injurious
to
the

hot
the

of

beyond

a
gleam
of

a

of

suddenly
out
of

rose
the
neigh

rattle
and
a
leaden
hail
out

swallowed
up

came
on

yelling
death
to
envelop
the
luckless

of

down
from

the

swept
on

across

to
the

where
the

had
made
a

fired
two

tore
down

his

of

fired
with
steadiness
greeting
with
hurrahs
every

the

pressed
on

behind

came
the

a

the

it
was
hot
work
as
the

speedily
found
crossing
the

over
the

one

licked
the

canopied
the

the

the

hurled
into

some
came
out
of
the
western
mouth
of
the
bridge
stamping
with
the
pain
of

the
point
was
that
they

off

some
might

escape
or
it
might
please
the

to
let

meet
with

his
guns
ceased
with
their
canister
and
limbering
up
thundered
away
toward
the
sun
now
low
and
red
in
the
heavens
the
infantry
followed
the
small
cavalry
force
bringing
up
the

now
rallying
and
threatening
the

footmen
the
shenandoah
was
impetuous
deep
turbid
with
many
eddies
lifted
by
the
spring
rains
almost
level
with
its
banks
the
horses
liked
it
not
poor
brutes
they
shuddered
whinnied
glared
with
distended
bloodshot
eyes
once
in
they
patiently
did
their
best
each
was
owned
by
its
rider
and
was
his
good
friend
as
well
as
servant
the
understanding
between
the
two
could
not
be
disturbed
no
not
even
by
the

soft
words

of

little
enough
in

and
of

the

responded
the
god
above
or
beside
him
wished
it
thus
and
certainly
should
be
obeyed
and
that
with
love
the
rough
torrent
the
eddies
the
violent
current
were
nothing
at
least
not
much
in
column
of
twos
the
horses
breasted
the
river
the
gods
above
them
singing
of
praise
and
reward
they
neared
the
western
shore
and
the
green
overhanging
trees
touched

plunged
a
little

came
out

high
on

jackson
with
flournoy
and
his
aides
the
first

watched
that
passage
of
the
squadrons
little
sorrel
slow
and
patient
had
perhaps
been
in
his
own
traversing
the
one
steed
to
hear
no
especial
word
of
endearment
nor
much
of
promise
he
did
not
seem
to
miss
them
he
and
jackson
apparently
understood
each
other
the
men
said
that
he
could
run
only
one
way
and
that
toward
the
enemy
far
down
the
front

it

it

in

corners
lay
dead

wounded
men
while
in
the
farmhouses
of

women
drew
the

gathered
the
children
about
them
and
sat
trembling
the
blue
cavalry
was
hard
put
to
it
the
grey
infantrymen
were
good
marksmen
and
their
line
was
long
drawn
across
the

the
up

down
of
the

here
and
there
now
and
again
a
trooper
went
down
to
the
dust

the

galloping
to

leaving

green
between

and
it
out
of
the

cloud
toward
the

now
rose
a
thud
of
many
hoofs
a
body
of
horse
coming
at
a
trot
the
sound
deepened
drew
nearer
changed
measure
the
horses
were
galloping
though
not
at
full
speed
they
could
be
seen
now
in
two
lines
under
bright
guidons
eating
up
the
waves
of
earth
galloping
toward
the
sunset
in
dust
and
heat
and
thunder
at
first
sight
like
toy
figures
men
and
horses
were
now
grown
they
threatened
in
the
act
of
passing
to
become
gigantic
the
sun
had
set
but
it
left
walls
and
portals
of
cloud
tinged
and
rimmed
with
fire
the
horsemen
seemed
some
aerial
race
so
straight
they
rode
into
the
west
the
ground
shook
the
dust
rose
higher
the
figures
enlarged
the
gallop
increased
energy
at
its
height
of
a
sudden
all
the
trumpets
blew
illustration
bugle
call
music
past
the
grey
infantry
frantically
yelling
its
welcome
swept
a
tremendous
charge
knee

knee
shouting

horse

man
one
war
shaft
endued
with
soul
and
lifted
to
an
ecstasy
they
went
by
flecked
with
foam
in
a
whirlwind
of
dust
in
an
infernal
clangour
with
the
blare
and
fury
the
port
and
horror
of
mars
attended
the
horses
stretched
neck
shook
mane
breathed
fire
the
horsemen
drained
to
the
lees
the
encrusted
heirloom
the
cup
of
warlike
passion
frenzied
they
all
rode
home
the
small
cavalry
force
opposed
gasped
at
the
apparition
certainly
their
officers
tried
to
rally
the
men
but
certainly
they
knew
it
for
futility
some
of
the
troopers
fired
their
carbines
at
the
approaching
tide
hoar
yelling
coming
now
so
swiftly
that
every
man
rode
as
a
giant
and
every
steed
seemed
a
spectre

others
did
not
all

fled
in

mad
gallop

own
kenly
infantry

in

packed
in
a
road
none
too
wide
between
ragged
banks
topped
by
rail
fences
two
panels
of
these
had
been
taken
down
preparatory
to
deploying
in
the
fields
but
the
movement
was
not
yet
made
kenly
had
his
face
turned
to
the
west
straining
his
eyes
for
the
guns
or
for
the
reinforcements
which
happily
general
banks
might
send
a
shout
arose
look
out
look
out
oh
good
lord
first
there
was
seen
a
horrible
dust
cloud
heard
a
great
thunder
of
hoofs
then
out
of
all
came
bloodshot
eyes
of
horses
stiffened
manes
blue
figures
downward
bent
on
the
necks
oaths
prayers
sounds
of
unnerved
nature
here
and
there
of
grim
fury
impotent
in
the
torrent
as
a
protesting
straw
into
the
blue
infantry
rode
the
blue
cavalry
all
down
the
road
ensued
a
dreadful
confusion
danger
and
uproar
men
sprang
for
their
lives
to
this
side
and
that
they
caught
at
jutting
roots
and
pulled
themselves
out
of
the
road
up
the
crumbling
banks
where
they
could
they
reached
the
rail
fences
tumbled
over
them
and
lay
gasping
close
alongside
the
majority
could
not
get
out
of
the
road
they
pressed
themselves
flat
against
the
shelving
banks
and
let
the
wedge
drive
through
many
were
caught
overturned
felt
the
fierce
blows
of
the
hoofs
regardless
of
any
wreck
behind
them
on
and
over
and
down
the
winchester
road
tore
the
maddened
horses
the
appalled
troopers
the
luckless
infantry
when
at
last
their
own
had
passed
had
no
time
to
form
before
the
confederate
charge
was
upon
them
at
the
highest
key
the
fiercest
light
the
extremest
motion
sound
and
sight
procuring
for
them
a
mighty
bass
and
background
came
jackson
charging
squadrons
they
swallowed
the
road
and
the
fields
on
either
hand
kenly
with
the
foremost
company
fired
once
a
volley
received
at
twenty
yards
and
emptying
ten
saddles
of
the
central
squadron
it
could
not
stay
the
unstayable
in
a
moment
in
a
twinkling
of
the
eye
with
indescribable
noise
with
roaring
as
of
undammed
waters
with
a
lapse
of
all
colours
into
red
with
smell
of
sweat
and
powder
hot
metal
and
burning
cloth
with
savour
of
poisoned
brass
in
furred
mouths
with
an
impact
of
body
with
sabre
blow
and
pistol
shot
with
blood
spilled
and
bone
splintered
with
pain
and
tremendous
horror
and
invading
nausea
with
delirium
with
resurgence
of
the
brute
with
jungle
triumph
berserker
rage
and
battle
ecstasy
came
the
shock
then
in
a
moment
the
melee
kenly
vainly
striving
to
rally
a
handful
about
the
colours
fell
all
but
mortally
wounded
in
the
wild
quarter
of
an
hour
that
elapsed
before
the
surrender
of
the
whole
many
of
the
blue
were
killed
many
more
wounded
far
and
wide
the
men
scattered
but
far
and
wide
they
were
ridden
down
one
of
the
guns
was
taken
almost
at
once
the
other
a
little
later
overtaken
a
mile
or
two
down
the
road
a
few
artillerymen
a
squad
or
two
of
cavalry
with
several
officers
marchmont
among
them
got
away
they
were
all
who
broke
the
trap
kenly
himself
twenty
officers
and
nine
hundred

the
dead
the
wounded
the
surrendered
together
with
a
section
of
artillery
some
unburned
stores
and
the
northern
colours
and
guidons
rested
in
jackson
hands
that
night
in

when
the

steven

waked
by

groaned
raised
himself
from
his
couch
ran
his
fingers
through
his
hair
kneaded
neck
arms
and
ankles
and
groaned
more
heavily
yet
he
was
dreadfully
stiff
and
sore
in

days
the

marched
more
than
eighty
miles

afoot
from

did
have
the
fun
of
the
battle
neither
remarked
steve
in
a
savagely
injured
tone
leastwise
none
of
us
but
the
damned
three
companies
and
a
platoon
of
ours
that
went
ahead
to
skirmish
they
knew
the
type
of

the

him
for
mirror

growled
steve
and
his
toilet
ended

across
to

my

it
my
lasting
hope
that
sh
fool
tom
jackson
break
you
same
as
he
broke
garnett
the
morning
at
first
divinely
cool
and
sweet
turned
hot
and
languid
humid
and
without
air
it
made
the
perspiration
stream
and
then
the
dust
rose
from
the
road
and
the
two
together
caused
the
most
discomfortable
grime
it
marked
all
faces
and
it
lodged
between
neck
and
neckband
and
wrist
and
wristband
where
it
chafed
the
skin
it
got
deep
into
the
shoes
through
holes
enough
god
knows
and
there
the
matter
became
serious
for
many
a
foot
was
galled
and
raw
it
got
into
eyes
and
they
grew
red
and
smarting
it
stopped
ear
and
nostril
it
lined
the
mouth
it
sifted
down
the
neck
and
made
the
body
miserable
at
the
starting
as
the
men
quit
the
green
banks
of
shenandoah
several
of
the
aesthetic
sort
had
been
heard
to
comment
upon
the
beauty
of
the
scenery
possibly
the
soul
for
beauty
lasted
but
as
for
the
scenery
it
vanished
the
brigade
was
now
upon
the
front
royal
and
winchester
pike
moving
in
the
foot
and
wheel
prints
of
the
advance
and
under
and
through
an
extended
cirrhus
cloud
of
dirty
saffron
the
scenery
could
not
be
viewed
through
it
mere
red
blotches
and
blurs
it
was
so
heavy
that
it
served
for
darkness
men
saw
each
other
dimly
at
the
distance
of
ten
feet
and
mounted
officers
and
couriers
went
by
dun
and
shapeless
through
the
thick
powder
steve
could
not
be
said
to
mind
grime
sergeant
mathew
coffin
did
he
was
forever
wiping
it
away
with
what
remained
to
him
of
a
handkerchief
but
the
stuff
in
his
shoes
made
his
feet
hurt
horribly
it
was
in
his
mouth
besides
where
it
made
him
thirsty
he
eyed
an
object
dangling
from
the
belt
of
the
man
next
him
and
since
from
long
habit
it
had
become
easy
to
him
to
break
the
tenth
commandment
he
broke
it
again
into
a
thousand
pieces
at
last
where
did
you
get
that
canteen
picked
it
up
at
mcdowell
ef

covered
with
dust
you

i
could

dry
sorry
reckon
we
come
to
a
stream
bimeby
saving
the
milk
an
emergency
it
did
not
appear
that
we
would
come
to
a
stream
or
a
spring
or
a
well
or
anything
liquid
to
anything
but
awful
miles
of
dust
and
heat
trudged
over
by
anything
but
boots
despite
the
spur
of
winder
speech
the
brigade
moved
with
dispiriting
slowness
it
was
not
the
first
in
column
there
were
troops
ahead
and
troops
behind
and
it
would
perhaps
have
said
that
it
was
not
its
part
to
overpass
the
one
and
outstrip
the
other
the
whole
line
lagged
close
up
men
close
up
cried
the
officers
through
throats
if
it
as
hot
as
ginger
then
let
the
ginger
show
step
out
back
from
the
head
of
the
column
came
peremptory
aides
press
on
general
jackson
says
on
yes
he
knows
you
marched
miles
yesterday
and
that
it
hot
weather
all
the
same
we
got
to
get
there
thank
you
colonel
i
will
take
a
swallow
i
damned
tired
myself
between
nine
and
ten
they
came
to
a
village
boys
and
women
stood
in
the
dusty
street
with
buckets
of
water
a
few
buckets
a
little
water
the
women
looked
pale
as
though
they
would
swoon
beads
of
sweat
stood
on
the
boys
brows
and
their
lips
worked
thousands
of
soldiers
had
passed
or
were
passing
all
thirsty
all
crying
water
please
water
please
women
and
boys
had
with
haste
drawn
bucket
after
bucket
from
the
wells
of
the
place
pumped
them
full
from
a
cistern
or
run
to
a
spring
and
come
panting
back
to
the
road
and
not
one
soldier
in
ten
could
get
his
tin
cup
filled
they
went
by
an
endless
line
a
few
refreshed
the
vast
majority
thirstier
for
the
tantalus
failure
the
water
bearers
were
more
deadly
tired
than
they
after
it
was
all
over
the
last
regiment
passed
the
women
went
indoors
trembling
in
every
limb
o
jesus
this
war
is
going
to
be
a
dreadful
thing
the
column
marching
on
and
passing
a
signpost
each
unit
read
what
it
had
to
say
miles
to
seven
miles
to
hell
some
time
later
the
brigade
made
a
discovery
they
are
willows
yes
they
are
running
cross
field
through
the
blur
whoever
toting
the
water
bucket
get
it
ready
the
halt
came
jackson
ten
minutes
out
of
an
hour
halt
the
water
buckets
were
ready
and
there
were
the
willows
that
the
dust
had
made
as
sere
as
autumn
but
where
was
the
stream
the
thin
trickle
of
water
had
been
overpassed
churned
trampled
into
mire
and
dirt
by
half
the
army
horse
and
foot
the
men
stared
in
blank
disappointment
a
polecat
could
drink
here
try
it
up
and
down
said
the
colonel
it
will
be
clearer
away
from
the
road
but
every
one
of
you
listen
for
the
steve
wandered
off
he
did
not
wait
for
clean
water
there
was
a
puddle
not
half
so
bad
as
thirst
settling
down
upon
his
hands
he
leaned
forward
and
drank
it
up
refreshed
he
rose
got
out
of
the
mire
back
to
the
bank
and
considered
a
deeper
belt
of
willows
farther
down
the
stream
they
were
on
the
edge
of
the
dust
belt
they
had
an
air
faintly
green
extremely
restful
steve
looked
over
his
shoulder
all
the
boys
were
drinking
or
seeking
a
place
to
drink
and
the
dust
was
like
a
red
twilight
furtively
swift
as
any
thunder
run
crittur
he
made
for
the
willows
they
formed
a
deep
little
copse
nobody
within
their
round
and
oh
joy
shade
and
a
little
miry
pool
steve
sat
down
and
drew
off
his
shoes
taking
some
pains
lest
in
the
action
side
and
sole
part
company
undoubtedly
his
feet
were
sore
and
swollen
red
and
fevered
he
drank
from
the
miry
pool
and
then
trousers
rolled
to
his
knees
sunk
foot
and
ankle
in
the
delicious
coolness
presently
he
lay
back
feet
yet
in
mud
and
water
body
flat
upon
cool
black
earth
overhead
a
thick
screen
of
willow
leaves
ef
i
had
a
corn
pone
and
never
had
to
move
i
would
change
for
heaven
o
gawd
that
damned
bugle
in
fall
in
fall
in
fall
in
with
a
deep
groan
steve
picked
up
his
shoes
and
dragged
himself
to
the
edge
of
the
copse
he
looked
out
danged
fools
running
back
to
line
like
chicks
when
the
hen
squawks
o
gawd
my
foot
too
sore
to
run
he
stood
looking
cautiously
out
of
an
opening
he
had
made
in
the
willow
branches
the
regiments
were
already
in
column
the
leading
one
the
formed
and
disappearing
in
the
dust
of
the
turnpike
air
ye
going
now
and
have
every
damned
officer
swearing
at
you
what
do
they
care
if
your
foot
cut
and
your
back
aches
and
you
could
come
no
sooner
ai
eyes
filled
with
tears
he
felt
sublimely
virtuous
a
martyr
from
the
first
what
does
anybody
there
care
for
they
would
care
if
i
dropped
dead
right
in
line
well
i
ai
to
gratify
them
what
war
anyhow
it
a
trap
to
catch
decent
folk
in
and
the
decenter
you
are
the
quicker
you
try
to
get
out
of
it
he
closed
the
willow
branches
and
stepped
back
to
his
lair
let
bellow
for
steve
just
as
loud
as
they
like
i
ai
got
no
call
to
fight
banks
on
this
here
foot
if
a
damned
comes
along
why
i
just
fell
asleep
and
could
help
it
so
tired
was
he
and
so
soothing
still
his
retreat
that
to
fall
asleep
was
precisely
what
he
did
the
sun
was
twenty
minutes
nearer
the
zenith
when
noise
roused
him
voices
up
and
down
the
stream
he
crawled
across
the
black
earth
and
looked
out
taliaferro
brigade
getting
watered
all
i
ask
is
you
just
let
me
and
my
willows
alone
he
might
ask
but
taliaferro
seemed
hardly
likely
to
grant
taliaferro
had
a
harder
time
even
than
the
stonewall
finding
water
there
was
less
there
to
find
and
it
was
muddier
the
men
swearing
at
their
luck
ranged
up
and
down
the
stream
it
was
presently
evident
that
the
search
might
bring
any
number
around
or
through
steve
cool
harbour
he
cursed
them
then
in
a
sudden
panic
picked
up
his
shoes
and
slipped
out
at
the
copse
back
door
stragglers
when
caught
were
liable
to
be
carried
on
and
summarily
deposited
with
their
rightful
companies
deserters
fared
worse
on
the
whole
steve
concluded
to
seek
safety
in
flight
at
a
little
distance
rose
a
belt
of
woods
roughly
parallel
with
the
road
steve
took
to
the
woods
and
found
sanctuary
behind
the
bole
of
an
oak
his
eye
advanced
just
beyond
the
bark
he
observed
the
movement
of
troops
with
something
like
a
grin
on
the
whole
he
thought
perhaps
he
would
rejoin
taliaferro
men
hardly
seemed
happy
up
and
down
the
trodden
miry
runlet
wuz
a
time
they
would
think
a
dog
could
drink
there
and
now
just
look
at
them
lapping
it
up
so
many
fine
fellows
too
gentlemen
and
yah
the
brigade
moved
on
as
had
done
the
stonewall
there
grew
in
the
wood
a
sound
what
that
scrambling
up
he
went
forward
between
the
trees
and
presently
came
full
upon
a
narrow
wood
road
with
a
thin
growth
of
forest
upon
the
other
side
the
sound
increased
steve
knew
it
well
he
stamped
upon
the
moss
with
the
foot
that
hurt
him
least
artillery
coming
and
all
them
damned
gunners
with
eyes
like
lynxes
he
crossed
the
road
and
the
farther
strip
of
woods
behind
him
the
approaching
wheels
rumbled
loudly
before
him
a
narrow
lane
stretched
through
a
ploughed
field
to
a
grassy
dooryard
and
a
small
house
on
the
edge
of
the
wood
was
a
mass
of
elderbush
just
coming
into
bloom
he
worked
his
way
into
the
centre
of
this
squatted
down
and
regarded
the
house
from
between
the
green
stems
smoke
rose
from
the
chimney
it
must
be
near
eleven
thought
steve
she
getting
dinner
behind
him
through
the
wood
on
toward
middletown
rumbled
the
passing
battery
the
heavy
sound
brought
a
young
woman
to
the
door
she
stood
looking
out
her
hands
shading
her
eyes
then
the
train
disappearing
went
back
to
her
work
steve
waited
until
the
sound
was
almost
dead
then
left
the
elder
went
up
the
lane
and
made
his
appearance
before
the
open
door
the
woman
turned
from
the
hearth
where
she
was
baking
bread
sir
morning
miss
said
steve
could
you
spare
a
poor
sick
soldier
a
bite
to
eat
he
ended
with
a
hollow
groan
and
the
weight
of
his
body
against
the
lintel
the
young
woman
dragged
forward
a
armchair
sit
right
down
there
of
course
i
give
you
something
to
eat
it
anything
catching
is
it
steve
sank
into
the
chair
it
was
pneumonia
and
my
strength
ai
come
back
yet
i
only
asked
because
i
have
to
think
of
my
baby
she
glanced
toward
a
cradle
by
the
window
pneumonia
is
dreadful
weakening
how
come
they
let
you
march
why
i
did
said
steve
want
to
be
left
behind
i
wanted
to
be
in
the
fight
with
the
rest
of
the
boys
so
the
captain
said
says
he
you
can
try
it
for
we
need
all
the
good
fighters
we
got
but
if
you
find
you
too
weak
to
go
on
fall
out
maybe
some
good
seraphim
will
give
you
i
ca
give
you
because
there
just
the
baby
and
myself
james
being
with
ashby
but
i
can
give
you
dinner
i
have
got
much
but
what
i
got
you
quite
welcome
to
you
kin
rest
here
till
evening
maybe
a
wagon
come
along
and
give
you
a
lift
so
you
can
get
there
in
time
get
where
why
wherever
the
battle
going
to
be
yaas
yaas
said
steve
it
surely
hard
lines
when
those
who
kin
fight
have
to
take
a
back
seat
of
illness
and
watch
the
other
kind
go
front
he
groaned
again
and
closed
his
eyes
i
do
suppose
you
got
a
drop
of
spirits
handy
the
woman
she
was
hardly
more
than
a
girl
hesitated
because
the
most
were
heroic
and
for
the
sake
of
that
most
all
confederate
soldiers
wore
the
garland
it
was
not
in
this
or
any
year
of
the
war
that
confederate
women
lightly
doubted
the
entire
heroism
of
the
least
of
individuals
so
that
he
wore
the
grey
it
was
to
them
most
nobly
most
pathetically
a
sacred
investiture
priest
without
but
brute
within
wolf
in
shepherd
clothing
were
to
them
not
more
nor
abhorrent
than
were
coward
traitor
or
shirk
enwrapped
in
the
pall
and
purple
of
the
grey
fine
lines
came
into
the
forehead
of
the
girl
standing
between
steve
and
the
hearth
she
remembered
suddenly
that
james
had
said
there
were
plenty
of
scamps
in
the
army
and
that
not
every
straggler
was
lame
or
ill
some
were
plain
deserters
i
have
got
any
spirits
she
answered
i
did
have
a
little
bottle
but
i
gave
it
to
a
sick
neighbour
anyhow
it
is
good
for
weak
lungs
steve
looked
at
her
with
cunning
eyes
you
did
give
it
all
away
he
thought
you
got
a
little
hid
somewhere
o
gawd
i
want
a
drink
so
bad
i
was
making
potato
soup
for
myself
said
the
girl
and
my
father
sent
me
half
a
barrel
of
flour
from
harrisonburg
and
i
was
baking
a
small
loaf
of
bread
for
it
sunday
it
done
now
and
slice
it
for
you
and
give
you
a
plate
of
soup
that
better
for
you
than
where
do
you
think
we
fight
where
oh
anywhere
the
damned
fools
strike
each
other
he
stumbled
to
the
table
which
she
was
spreading
she
glanced
at
him
there
a
basin
and
a
roller
towel
on
the
back
porch
and
the
pump
handy
would
you
like
to
wash
your
face
and
hands
steve
shook
his
tousled
head
naw
i
so
burned
the
skin
would
come
off
o
gawd
this
soup
is
good
people
getting
over
fevers
and
lung
troubles
do
usually
burn
they
stay
white
and
peaked
even
out
of
doors
in
july
i
reckon
i
ai
that
kind
i
take
another
plateful
gawd
what
a
pretty
arm
you
got
the
girl
ladled
out
for
him
the
last
spoonful
of
soup
then
went
and
stood
with
her
foot
upon
the
cradle
rocker
i
reckon
you
ai
that
kind
she
said
beneath
her
breath
if
you
ever
had
pneumonia
i
bet
it
was
before
the
war
steve
finished
his
dinner
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
stretched
himself
gawd
if
i
just
had
a
nip
look
here
i
do
believe
you
gave
all
that
apple
brandy
away
you
look
and
see
if
you
was
mistaken
there
is
any
you
got
too
pretty
a
mouth
to
be
lying
the
doctor
prescribed
it
you
had
dinner
and
you
rested
there
a
wood
road
over
there
that
cuts
off
a
deal
of
distance
to
middletown
it
rough
but
shady
i
believe
if
you
tried
you
could
get
to
middletown
almost
as
soon
as
the
army
did
i
tell
you
i
had
a
furlough
where
you
keep
that
peach
brandy
when
you
had
it
i
looking
for
james
home
any
minute
now
he
patrolling
between
here
and
the
pike
you
lying
you
said
he
was
with
ashby
and
ashby
away
north
to
newtown
the
damned
west
that
marches
at
the
head
of
the
brigade
said
so
you
have
got
the
truth
in
you
and
that
a
pity
for
otherwise
i
like
your
looks
he
rose
i
going
foraging
for
that
mountain
dew
the
girl
moved
toward
the
door
pushing
the
cradle
in
front
of
her
steve
stepped
between
slammed
the
door
and
locked
it
putting
the
key
in
his
pocket
now
you
jest
stay
still
where
you
are
or
it
be
the
worse
for
you
and
for
the
baby
too
do
be
figuring
on
the
window
or
the
back
door
i
got
eyes
in
the
side
of
my
head
and
catch
you
before
you
get
there
that
thar
cupboard
looks
promising
the
cupboard
not
only
promised
it
fulfilled
steve
groping
hand
closed
upon
and
drew
forth
a
small
old
revolutionary
brandy
bottle
quite
full
over
his
shoulder
he
shot
a
final
look
at
once
precautionary
and
triumphant
you
purty
liar
jest
you
wait
till
i
had
my
dram
an
old
lustre
mug
stood
upon
the
shelf
he
filled
this
almost
to
the
brim
then
lifted
it
from
the
board
there
was
a
sound
from
by
the
door
familiar
enough
to
steve
namely
the
cocking
of
a
trigger
you
put
that
mug
down
said
the
voice
of
his
hostess
or
i
put
a
bullet
through
you
shut
that
cupboard
door
go
and
sit
down
in
that
chair
loaded
i
drew
the
cartridge
you
do
remember
whether
you
did
or
not
and
you
are
willing
for
me
to
try
and
find
out
you
set
down
there
that
it
right
there
where
i
can
see
you
my
grandmother
birthday
mug
yes
and
she
saw
her
mother
kill
an
indian
right
here
right
where
the
old
log
cabin
used
to
stand
well
i
reckon
i
can
manage
a
dirty
sneaking
hound
like
you
grandmother
cup
indeed
that
i
do
even
let
james
drink
out
of

gun
down
and
listen
to
reason
i
listening
to
something
else
there

or
four
horses

down
the
road

that
gun
down

just
as
peaceable
and
whether

or
grey

hope

god
they
take
you
off
my
hands
there
they
turned
up
the
lane
they
coming
by
the
house
she
raised
a
strong
young
voice
help

made
them

waked
the

round
to
the
window
bye
baby
bye
the
dismounted
cavalryman
an
officer
appeared
outside
the
open
window
his
eyes
rested
a
moment
upon
the
interior
then
he
put
hands
upon
the
sill
and
swung
himself
up
and
into
the
room
what
all
this
has
this
soldier
annoyed

thanks

man

orderly

him
up
behind
and
when
we

middletown
i
turn
him
over
with
my
report
to
his
captain
if
any
more
of
his
kind
come
around
i
would
advise
you
just
to
shoot
them
at
now
you
sir
in
front
of
march
the
five
horsemen
detail
of
flournoy
sent
upon
some
service
the
night
before
mounted
a
hill
from
which
was
visible
a
great
stretch
of
country
from
the
east
came
the
front
royal
road
north
and
south
stretched
that
great
artery
the
valley
turnpike
dust
lay
over
the
front
royal
road
dust
hung
above
the
valley
pike
hung
from
strasburg
to
middletown
and
well
beyond
middletown
out
of
each
extended
cloud
now
at
right
angles
came
rumblings
as
of
thunder
the
column
beneath
the
front
royal
cloud
was
moving
rapidly
halts
and
delays
apparently
over
lassitude
gone
energy
raised
to
a
forward
blowing
flame
that
on
the
valley
pike
the
retreat
from
strasburg
was
making
too
a
progress
not
unrapid
considering
the
immensity
of
its
wagon
train
and
the
uncertainty
of
the
commanding
general
as
to
what
on
the
whole
it
might
be
best
to
do
the
confederate
advance
it
was
evident
would
strike
the
pike
at
middletown
in
less
than
fifteen
minutes
stafford
and
his
men
left
the
hill
entered
a
body
of
woods
running
toward
the
village
and
three
minutes
later
encountered
a
detachment
of
blue
horsemen
flankers
of
hatch
large
cavalry
force
convoying
the
federal
wagon
train
there
was
a
shout
and
an
interchange
of
pistol
shots
the
blue
outnumbered
the
grey
four
to
one
the
latter
wheeled
their
horses
used
spur
and
voice
outstripped
a
shower
of
bullets
and
reached
middletown
when
breathless
they
drew
rein
before
a
street
down
which
grey
infantry
poured
to
the
onslaught
one
of
the
men
pressing
up
to
stafford
made
his
report
that
damned
deserter
sir
in
the
scrimmage
a
moment
ago
he
must
have
slipped
off
sorry
but
i
do
reckon
he
much
loss
steve
had
taken
refuge
behind
the
lock
of
a
rail
fence
draped
with
creeper
on
the
whole
he
meant
to
stay
there
until
the
two
armies
had
wended
their
ways
when
it
was
all
done
and
over
he
would
make
a
change
somehow
and
creep
to
the
southward
and
get
a
doctor
certificate
all
this
in
the
first
gasp
of
relief
at
the
end
of
which
moment
it
became
apparent
that
the
blue
cavalry
had
seen
him
run
to
cover
a
couple
of
troopers
rode
toward
the
rail
fence
steve
stepped
from
behind
the
creepers
and
surrendered
thar
are
daggs
up
north
anyway
he
explained
to
the
man
who
took
his
musket
i
a
pack
of
third
cousins
in
them
parts
somewhere
i
should
wonder
if
they
were
fighting
on
your
side
this
minute
i
reckon
i
as
lief
fight
there
myself
the
soldier
took
him
to
his
officer
it
a
damned
deserter
sir
says
he
got
cousins
with
us
says
he
as
soon
fight
on
one
side
as
the
other
i
ca
very
well
fight
nowhere
whined
steve
if
you
be
so
good
as
to
look
at
my
foot
sir
i
see
you
deserted
and
they
picked
you
up
very
well
deserter
i
want
some
information
and
you
the
man
to
give
it
to
me
steve
gave
it
without
undue
reluctance
what
in
hell
does
it
matter
anyway
he
thought
they
find
out
damned
quick
anyhow
about
numbers
and
that
we
are
only
ewell
gawd
old
jack
struck
them
this
very
minute
i
hear
the
guns
so
did
the
company
to
which
he
had
deserted
hell
and
damnation
artillery
to
shake
the
earth
middletown
all
the
wagons
to
pass
and
the
it
is
just
ewell
division
he
says
he
says
it
all
of
them
and
stonewall
jackson
take
the
fellow
up
somebody
and
bring
him
along
right
forward
five
minutes
later
they
reached
the
pike
south
of
middletown
it
proved
a
seething
stream
of
horse
and
foot
and
wagon
train
forms
shadowy
and
umber
moving
in
the
whirling
dust
over
all
hung
like
a
vast
and
black
streamer
a
sense
of
panic
underneath
it
every
horse
was
restive
and
every
voice
had
an
edge
steve
gathered
that
there
were
teamsters
who
wished
to
turn
and
go
back
to
strasburg
he
saw
wagon
masters
plying
long
black
whips
about
the
shoulders
of
these
unwilling
he
heard
officers
shouting
the
guns
ahead
boomed
out
and
there
came
a
cry
of
ashby
the
next
instant
found
him
violently
unseated
and
hurled
into
the
dust
of
the
middle
road
from
which
he
escaped
by
rolling
with
all
the
velocity
of
which
he
was
capable
into
the
depression
at
the
side
he
hardly
knew
what
had
happened
there
had
been
he
thought
a
runaway
team
dragging
an
ordnance
wagon
he
seemed
to
remember
a
moving
thickness
in
the
dust
and
visible
for
an
instant
a
great
painted
on
the
wagon
side
then
shouts
general
scatteration
some
kind
of
a
crash
he
rubbed
a
bump
upon
his
forehead
large
as
a
guinea
hen
egg
gawd
i
wish
i
never
come
into
this
here
world
the
world
was
indeed
rather
like
a
bad
dream
like
one
of
those
dim
and
tangled
streams
of
things
strange
and
frightful
at
once
grotesquely
unfamiliar
and
sickeningly
real
which
one
neighbours
for
a
time
in
sleep
steve
picked
himself
out
of
the
ditch
being
much
in
danger
even
there
of
trampling
hoofs
or
wagons
gone
amuck
and
attained
how
he
could
not
tell
a
rank
wayside
clump
of
jamestown
weed
and
pokeberry
in
the
midst
of
this
he
squatted
gathered
into
as
small
a
bunch
as
was
physically
possible
he
was
in
a
panic
the
sweat
cold
upon
the
back
of
his
hands
action
or
inaction
in
this
world
sitting
standing
or
going
seemed
alike
ugly
and
dangerous
first
of
all
this
world
was
and
he
was
dressed
in
grey
it
was
in
a
wild
hurry
the
main
stream
striving
somehow
to
gain
middletown
which
must
be
passed
hook
or
crook
aid
of
devil
or
aid
of
saint
while
a
second
current
surged
with
increasing
strength
back
toward
strasburg
all
was
confusion
they
would
never
stop
to
listen
to
explanations
as
to
a
turned
coat
steve
was
sure
that
they
would
simply
shoot
him
or
cut
him
down
before
he
could
say
i
am
one
of
you
they
would
kill
him
like
a
stray
bee
in
the
hive
and
go
their
way
one
way
or
the
other
whichever
way
they
were
going
the
contending
motions
made
him
giddy
an
aide
in
blue
galloping
madly
from
the
front
encountered
beside
the
pokeberry
clump
an
officer
directing
with
his
sword
steve
was
morally
assured
that
they
had
seen
him
had
stopped
in
short
to
hale
him
forth
as
they
did
not
only
excitedly
shouted
each
at
the
other
he
drew
breath
again
he
could
see
the
two
but
dimly
close
though
they
were
because
of
the
dust
suddenly
there
came
to
him
a
thought
that
same
veil
must
make
him
invisible
more
than
that
the
dust
lay
so
thickly
on
all
things
that
colour
in
any
uniform
was
a
debatable
quality
he
did
believe
anybody
was
noticing
the
extreme
height
to
which
his
courage
ever
attained
was
at
once
his
he
felt
almost
the
aide
was
shouting
so
that
he
might
be
heard
through
the
uproar
where
are
the
guns
colonel
hatch
says
for
the
good
lord
sake
hurry
them
up
hell
broke
loose
and
occupied
middletown
ashby
there
and
they
say
jackson
they
planted
guns
they
strung
thousands
of
men
behind
stone
fences
they
using
our
own
wagons
for
breastworks
the
cavalry
was
trying
to
get
past
listen
to
that
the
other
officer
shouted
also
waving
his
sword
there
a
battery
behind
here
it
comes
we
ought
to
have
started
last
night
the
general
said
he
must
develop
the
forces
of
the
enemy
he
developing
them
all
right
well
meet
in
washington
the
battery
passed
with
uproar
clanging
toward
the
front
scattering
men
to
either
side
like
spray
steve
wayside
bower
was
invaded
get
out
of
here
this
ai
no
time
to
be
sitting
on
your
tail
thinking
of
going
fishing
steve
went
covered
with
dust
the
shade
of
the
uniform
below
never
noticed
in
the
furious
excitement
of
the
road
life
there
was
at
fever
point
aware
that
death
was
hovering
and
struggling
to
escape
in
the
dust
and
uproar
the
blare
and
panic
he
was
aware
that
he
was
moving
toward
middletown
where
they
were
fighting
fighting
was
not
precisely
that
for
which
he
was
looking
and
yet
he
was
moving
that
way
and
he
could
not
help
it
the
noise
in
front
was
frightful
the
head
of
the
column
of
which
he
now
formed
an
unwilling
part
the
head
of
the
snake
must
be
somewhere
near
newtown
the
rattling
tail
just
out
of
strasburg
the
snake
was
trying
to
get
clear
trying
to
get
out
of
the
middle
valley
to
winchester
fifteen
miles
away
it
was
trying
to
drag
its
painful
length
through
the
village
just
ahead
there
were
scorpions
in
the
village
on
both
sides
the
pike
on
the
hills
above
stonewall
jackson
with
his
old
sabre
with
his
good
good
was
hacking
at
the
snake
just
there
in
its
middle
the
old
sabre
had
not
yet
cut
quite
through
but
there
was
hope
or
fear
the
deserter
positively
did
not
know
which
that
presently
it
would
be
done
a
tall
soldier
beside
whom
in
the
dream
torrent
steve
found
himself
began
to
talk
got
any
water
no
nobody
has
i
guess
it
pouring
down
rain
in
new
bedford
this
very
minute
all
the
little
streams
running
he
sighed
no
use
in
fussing
i
do
remember
to
have
ever
seen
you
before
but
then
we
all
mixed
up
we
are
said
steve
ai
the
racket
awful
awful
is
going
to
be
like
running
the
gauntlet
to
run
that
town
and
we
most
there
if
i
do
get
out
alive
and
if
you
ever
go
to
new
bedford
whoa
there
look
out
steve
thrust
by
the
press
away
from
the
pike
into
a
middletown
street
looked
for
a
cellar
door
through
which
he
might
descend
and
be
in
darkness
all
the
street
was
full
of
struggling
forms
a
man
on
horseback
tall
and
horrible
in
the
nightmare
cut
at
him
with
a
sabre
as
long
as
himself
steve
ducked
went
under
the
horse
belly
and
came
up
to
have
a
pistol
shot
take
the
cap
from
his
head
with
a
yell
he
ran
beneath
the
second
horse
arching
neck
the
animal
reared
a
third
horseman
raised
his
carbine
there
was
an
overturned
conestoga
wagon
in
the
middle
of
the
street
its
white
top
like
a
bubble
in
all
the
wild
swirl
and
eddy
of
the
place
steve
and
the
ball
from
the
carbine
passed
under
the
arch
at
the
same
instant
the
bullet
lodging
somewhere
in
the
wagon
bed
steve
at
first
thought
he
might
be
dead
for
it
was
cool
and
dark
under
the
tilted
canvas
and
there
was
a
momentary
effect
of
quietness
the
carbine
had
been
fired
perhaps
the
bullet
was
in
his
brain
the
uncertainty
held
but
a
second
outside
the
fracas
burst
forth
again
and
beneath
him
something
moved
in
the
straw
it
proved
to
be
the
driver
of
the
wagon
wounded
and
fallen
back
from
the
seat
in
front
he
spoke
now
in
a
curious
dreamy
voice
get
off
the
top
of
my
broken
leg
damn
you
to
everlasting
hell
steve
squirmed
to
one
side
sorry
gawd
knows
i
wish
i
was
any
nearer
it
than
the
peaks
of
otter
there
was
a
triangular
tear
in
the
canvas
he
drew
down
the
flap
and
looked
out
they
were
ashby
men
all
those
three
he
began
to
cry
though
noiselessly
they
had
ought
to
cut
at
me
like
that
shooting
too
without
looking
they
ought
to
ha
seen
i
was
no
damned
yank
the
figure
in
the
straw
moved
steve
turned
sick
with
apprehension
did
you
hear
what
i
said
i
was
just
gawd
it
enough
to
make
a
man
wish
he
was
a
johnny
reb
hey
what
did
you
say
but
the
figure
in
blue
said
nothing
or
only
some
useless
thing
about
wanting
water
steve
reassured
looked
again
out
of
window
his
refuge
lay
a
few
feet
from
the
pike
and
the
pike
was
a
road
through
pandemonium
he
could
see
upon
a
height
dimly
through
the
dust
and
smoke
the
rockbridge
battery
yellow
flashes
came
from
it
then
sound
a
federal
force
horse
foot
and
guns
had
hastily
formed
in
the
opposite
fields
seized
a
crest
planted
cannon
these
sent
screaming
shells
in
between
the
iron
giants
roared
the
melee
ashby
jousting
with
hatch
convoying
cavalry
the
louisiana
troops
firing
in
a
long
battle
line
from
behind
the
stone
fences
a
horrible
jam
of
wagons
overturned
or
overturning
mules
drivers
raving
out
oaths
using
mercilessly
long
snaky
black
whips
heat
dust
thirst
and
thunder
wild
excitement
blood
and
death
there
were
all
manner
of
wagons
ambulances
were
there
with
inmates
fantastic
sickrooms
with
glare
for
shade
tartarean
heat
for
coolness
cannon
thunder
and
shouting
for
quietness
grey
enemies
for
nursing
women
and
for
home
a
battlefield
in
a
hostile
land
heavy
ordnance
wagons
far
from
the
guns
they
were
meant
to
feed
traces
cut
and
horses
gone
rested
for
the
tides
to
break
against
travelling
forges
kept
them
company
and
wagons
bearing
luggage
beneath
several
the
mules
were
pinned
dreadful
sight
could
any
there
have
looked
or
pitied
looming
through
there
were
the
great
supply
wagons
with
others
of
lighter
stores
holding
boxes
and
barrels
of
wines
and
fruits
commodities
of
all
sorts
fripperies
luxuries
of
all
manner
poured
across
the
potomac
for
her
soldiers
by
the
north
sutlers
wagons
did
not
lack
garishly
stocked
forlorn
as
harlequin
in
the
day
stress
in
and
around
and
over
all
these
stranded
hulls
roared
the
opposing
forces
steve
saw
ashby
on
the
black
stallion
directing
with
a
gauntleted
hand
four
great
draught
horses
drawing
a
loaded
van
without
a
driver
maddened
with
fright
turned
into
this
street
up
and
down
which
there
was
much
fighting
a
shout
arose
carbines
cracked
one
of
the
leaders
came
down
upon
his
knees
the
other
slipped
in
blood
and
fell
the
van
overturned
pinning
beneath
it
one
of
the
wheel
horses
its
fall
immediately
beside
the
conestoga
blocked
steve
window
he
turned
to
crawl
to
the
other
side
as
he
did
so
the
wounded
soldier
in
the
straw
had
a
remark
to
make
he
made
it
in
the
dreamy
voice
he
had
used
before
do
you
smell
cloth
burning
steve
did
in
an
instant
saw
it
burning
as
well
first
the
corner
of
the
canvas
cover
then
the
straw
beneath
he
gave
a
screech
we
on
fire
gawd
i
got
to
get
out
of
this
the
man
in
the
straw
talked
dreamily
on
i
got
a
bullet
through
the
end
of
my
backbone
i
ca
sit
up
i
been
lying
here
studying
the
scoop
of
this
here
old
wagon
it
looks
to
me
like
the
firmament
at
night
with
all
the
stars
there
no
end
of
texts
about
stars
as
one
star
differeth
from
another
he
began
to
cough
there
seems
to
be
smoke
i
guess
you
have
to
drag
me
out
brother
at
the
end
of
the
village
a
stone
fence
ran
between
two
houses
on
the
other
side
of
a
little
garden
slope
planted
with
potatoes
in
the
shadow
of
the
wall
a
line
of
men
kneeling
rested
rifle
barrel
upon
the
coping
and
fired
on
hatch
cavalry
now
much
broken
wavering
toward
dispersion
at
first
the
line
was
hidden
by
a
swirl
of
smoke
this
lifted
and
steve
recognized
a
guidon
they
had
planted
then
the
men
themselves
they
were
the
louisiana
tigers
wheat
battalion
upgathered
from
levee
and
wharf
and
new
orleans
purlieu
among
many
of
a
better
cast
not
lacking
rufflers
and
bravos
soldiers
of
fortune
whom
pappenheim
might
not
have
scorned
their
stone
wall
leaped
fire
again
steve
looked
to
heaven
and
earth
and
as
far
around
as
the
dun
cloud
permitted
then
moved
with
swiftness
across
the
potato
patch
all
about
in
the
mingled
dust
and
smoke
showed
a
shifting
pageantry
of
fighting
men
upon
the
black
earth
below
the
rank
green
leaves
and
purple
blooms
lay
in
postures
hardly
conceivable
the
dead
and
wounded
in
the
line
by
the
stone
fence
was
here
and
there
a
gap
steve
head
between
shoulders
made
for
the
breastwork
and
sank
into
one
of
these
openings
his
neighbour
upon
one
hand
an
irish
roustabout
on
the
other
a
creole
from
a
sugar
plantation
he
explained
his
own
presence
i
got
kind
of
separated
from
my
company

virginia

had
an
awful
fight
with
three
damned
yanks
and

the
valley
pike
as
he
moved
away
from
the
stone
house
the
vicinity
of
ashby
and
the
line
of
tigers
behind
the
fence
he
became
aware
that
not
a
small
portion
of
wheat
battalion
had
broken
ranks
and
was
looting
the
wagons
there
were
soldiers
like
grey
ants
about
a
sutler
wagon
steve
struggling
and
shouldering
boldly
enough
now
managed
to
get
within
hailing
distance
men
were
standing
on
the
wheels
drawing
out
boxes
and
barrels
and
throwing
them
down
into
the
road
where
the
ants
swarmed
to
the
attack
not
the
tigers
alone
but
a
number
of
ashby
men
as
well
engaged
in
the
general
business
the
latter
either
not
so
hungry
or
more
valiant

half

from

they
came
up
with
a
forlorn
little
company
on
a
high
bank
above
the
road
huddled
beneath
three
cedars
appeared
the
theatrical
troupe
which
had
amused
general
banks
army
in
strasburg
men
and
women
there
were
a
dozen
actors
and
they
had
with
them
a
cart
bearing
their
canvas
booth
and
the
poor
finery
of
their
wardrobe
one
of
the
women
nursed
a
baby
they
all
looked
down
like
wraiths
upon
the
passing
soldiers

broke
out
ahead
newtown
said
the
men
beside
steve
i
got
friends
there
told
when
we
came
up
the
valley
after
kernstown
come
down
again
here
we
are
bigger
life
and
twice
as
natural
that
rockbridge
making
that
awful
noise
must
be
a
yankee
battery
there
it
opens
oh
we
going
to
have
a
chance
too
they
were
moving
at
steve
simulated
a
stumble
caught
himself
groaned
and
fell
out
of
line
the
wall
to
the
left
blazed
he
uttered
a
yell
and
sprang
back
that
right
said
the
man
taken
most
a
year
to
learn
it
but
you
feel
a
whole
heap
safer
in
line
than
out
of
it
when
firing
going
on
that
a
nice
little
what
d
call
it
they
planted
there
avalanche
panted
steve
o
gawd
a
minie
ball
had
pierced
the
other
brain
he
fell
without
a
sound
and
steve
went
on
the
troops
entered
the
hamlet
at
a
run
passing
two
of
the
rockbridge
guns
planted
on
a
hillock
and
hurling
shell
against
a
federal
battery
at
the
far
end
of
the
street
there
was
hot
fighting
through
the
place
then
the
enemy
rallied
here
broke
again
and
dispersed
to
the
westward
the
grey
soldiers
swept
through
the
place
and
the
people
with
tears
and
laughter
cried
them
welcome
on
the
porch
of
a
comfortable
house
stood
a
comfortable
comely
matron
pale
with
ardent
patriotism
the
happy
tears
running
down
her
cheeks
parched
as
were
their
throats
the
troops
found
voice
to
cheer
as
always
when
they
passed
through
these
valley
towns
they
waved
their
colours
vigorously
their
ragged
bit
of
a
band
played
old
virginny
never
tire
the
motherly
soul
on
the
porch
unconscious
of
self
uplifted
tremulous
with
emotion
opened
wide
her
arms
all
of
you
run
here
and
kiss
me
late
afternoon
came
and
the
army
yet
skirmished
marched
marched
skirmished
on
the
valley
pike
the
heat
decreased
but
dust
and
thirst
remained
fatigue
was
the
abominable
thing
gawd
thought
steve
i
ca
stand
it
any
longer
i
got
ter
quit
and
ef
i
could
shoot
that
lieutenant
i
would
the
man
whom
the
closing
of
the
ranks
had
brought
upon
his
left
began
to
speak
in
a
slow
refined
voice
there
was
a
book
published
in
england
a
year
or
so
ago
it
brings
together
old
observations
shoots
and
theories
welds
them
and
produces
a
hammer
that
likely
to
crack
some
heads
once
upon
a
time
it
seems
we
went
on
four
feet
it
a
pity
to
have
lost
so
valuable
a
faculty
oh
jupiter
we
are
tired
a
man
behind
put
in
his
word
sunday
two
sundays
ago
we
were
at
meechum
river
and
since
then
we
marched
most
two
hundred
miles
and
fought
two
battles
and
a
heap
of
skirmishes
i
reckon
there
be
a
big
fight
with
old
jack
jerking
his
hand
in
the
air
as
they
say
he
been
doing
all
to
the
sound
of
church
bells
oh
moses
i
tired
at
sunset
the
bugles
blew
halt
the
men
dropped
down
on
the
tarnished
earth
on
the
vast
spectacular
road
to
winchester
they
cared
not
so
much
for
supper
faint
as
they
were
they
wanted
sleep
supper
they
had
all
that
could
be
obtained
from
the
far
corners
of
haversacks
and
all
that
with
abounding
willingness
the
neighbouring
farmhouses
could
scrape
together
but
when
it
came
to
sleep
with
nodding
heads
the
men
waited
longingly
for
roll
call
and
tattoo
and
instead
there
came
an
order
from
the
front
night
march
o
lord
have
mercy
for
stonewall
jackson
never
does
in
fall
in
column
forward
when
they
came
to
the
opequon
they
had
a
skirmish
with
a
massachusetts
regiment
which
fired
a
heavy
volley
into
the
cavalry
ahead
driving
it
back
upon
the
virginia
next
in
column
the
broke
then
rallied
other
of
the
stonewall
regiments
deployed
in
the
fields
and
the
advanced
against
the
opposing
force
part
of
banks
rearguard
it
gave
way
disappearing
in
the
darkness
of
the
woods
the
grey
column
pushing
across
the
opequon
came
into
a
zone
of
federal
skirmishers
and
sharpshooters
ambushed
behind
stone
fences
somewhere
about
midnight
steve
walking
in
about
the
worst
dream
he
had
ever
had
determined
that
no
effort
was
too
great
if
directed
toward
waking
it
was
a
magic
lantern
dream
black
slides
painted
only
with
stars
and
fireflies
succeeded
by
slides
in
which
there
was
a
moment
violent
illumination
stone
fences
leaping
into
being
as
the
musket
fire
ran
along
a
halt
a
company
deployed
the
foe
dispersed
streaming
off
into
the
darkness
the
hurt
laid
to
one
side
for
the
ambulances
forward
sometimes
a
gun
was
unlimbered
trained
upon
the
threatening
breastwork
and
fired
once
a
shell
burst
beneath
a
wagon
that
had
been
drawn
into
the
fields
it
held
it
appeared
inflammable
stores
wagon
and
contents
shot
into
the
air
with
a
great
sound
and
glare
and
out
of
the
light
about
the
place
came
a
frightful
crying
men
ran
to
right
and
left
to
escape
the
rain
of
missiles
then
the
light
died
out
and
the
crying
ceased
the
column
went
on
slowly
past
dark
slides
its
progress
seemed
that
of
a
snail
army
winchester
lay
the
fewest
of
miles
away
but
somewhere
there
was
legerdemain
the
fewest
of
miles
stretched
like
a
rubber
band
the
troops
marched
for
three
minutes
halted
marched
again
halted
marched
halted
to
sleep
to
sleep
forward
column
forward
there
was
a
bridge
to
cross
over
a
wide
ditch
steve
hardly
broke
his
dream
but
here
he
changed
the
current
how
he
managed
he
could
scarce
have
told
but
he
did
find
himself
under
the
bridge
where
at
once
he
lay
down
the
mire
and
weed
was
like
a
blissful
bed
he
closed
his
eyes
three
feet
above
was
the
flooring
and
all
the
rearguard
passing
over
it
was
like
lying
curled
in
the
hollow
of
a
drum
a
drum
beaten
draggingly
and
slow
gawd
thought
steve
it
sounds
like
a
dead
march
he
slept
despite
the
canopy
of
footsteps
he
might
have
lain
like
a
log
till
morning
but
that
at
last
the
flooring
of
the
bridge
rebelled
a
section
of
a
battery
kept
for
some
hours
at
middletown
found
itself
addressed
by
a
courier
jaded
hoarse
as
a
raven
of
the
night
general
jackson
says
up
these
guns
he
says
haste
the
battery
limbered
up
and
came
with
a
heavy
noise
down
the
pike
through
the
night
before
it
was
the
rearguard
the
artillery
heard
the
changed
sound
as
the
men
crossed
the
wooden
bridge
the
rearguard
went
on
the
guns
arrived
also
at
the
ditch
and
the
overtaxed
bridge
the
tredegar
iron
gun
went
over
and
on
gaining
on
the
foot
with
intent
to
pass
the
howitzer
following
proved
the
last
straw
the
bridge
broke
a
gun
wheel
went
down
and
amid
the
oaths
of
the
drivers
a
frightened
screech
came
from
below
o
gawd
lem
me
get
out
of
this
pulled
out
he
gave
an
account
of
his
cut
foot
piteous
enough
the
lieutenant
listened
the
scamp
i
reckon
but
flesh
is
weak
has
been
exactly
a
circus
parade
for
any
of
us
let
him

ever
we

one
hour
you

lie
down
in
the
first
grey
streak
of
dawn
a
battery
which
had
passed
in
turn
each
segment
of
the
column
came
up
with
the
van
beyond
kernstown
battlefield
and
halted
upon
a
little
rise
of
ground
all
around
stretched
grey
fields
and
woods
and
all
around
lay
an
army
sleeping
strange
sight
in
the
still
and
solemn
light
with
the
birds
cheeping
overhead
the
guns
stopped
the
men
got
down
from

beyond

great
breach
that
had
been
made
in

fence
arose
from

cloak
he
had
spread
in

came

thickens
and
the
crow
makes
wing
to
the
rooky
wood
the
poor

even
they
look
overmarched
as
he
spoke
he
stroked
the
howitzer
as
though
it
had
been
a
living
thing
we
got
with
us
a
stray
of
yours
said
the
artilleryman
says
he
has
a
cut
foot
but
looks
like
a
skulker
here
you
come
from
behind
that
caisson
out
of
a
wood
road
a
misty
opening
overarched
by
tall
and
misty
trees
came
two
or
three
horsemen
the
foremost
of
whom
rode
up
to
the
battery
randolph

on

royal
road
he
has
eaten
breakfast
and
is
clanking
his
spurs
and
swearing
as
they
swore
in
flanders
he
pointed
with
his
gauntleted
hand
turning
as
he
did
so
in
the
saddle
the
action
brought
recognition
of
cleave
presence
upon
the
road
stafford
ceased
speaking
and
sat
still
observing
the
other
with
narrowed
eyes
cleave
addressed
the
figure
which
there
being
no

for
it
had
come
from
behind

you
dagg

this
time

left
of
it
now
let
me
see
is
that
the
cut
that
scratch
above
the
ankle
it
ai
how
deep
it
is
it
how
it
hurts
there
is
no
infantryman
who
is
not
footsore
and
tired
only
the
straggler
or
deserter
has
as
few
marks
as
you
to
show
there
is
the
company
down
the
road
in
the
field
i
shall
find
out
if
you
have
been
with
it
all
the
day
go

disgrace
the
very
mountains
where
you
were
born
beyond

guns
was
a
misty
bend
of
the
road
the
light
was
stronger
in
the
east
a
slender
streamer
of
carnation
the
air
dank
cool
and
still
on
the
edge
of
kernstown
battlefield
a
cock
crew
a
second
horn
came
faintly
very
near
at
hand
sounded
a
jingle
of
accoutrement
stonewall
jackson
two
or
three
of
the
staff
with
him
came
around
the
turn
and
stopped
beside
the
guns
the
men
about
them
and
the
horses
and
on
the
roadside
drew
themselves
up
and
saluted
jackson
gave
his
slow
quiet
nod
he
was
all
leaf
bronze
from
head
to
foot
his
eyes
just
glinting
beneath
the
old
forage
cap
he
addressed
the
lieutenant
you
will
advance
sir
in
just
three
quarters
of
an
hour
there
are
batteries
in
place
upon
the
ridge
before
us
you
will
take
position
there
and
you
will
not
leave
until
ordered
his
eyes
fell
upon
stafford
have
you
come
from
general
ewell
yes
general
he
sends
his
compliments
and
says
he
is
ready
good
good
what
is
this
soldier
doing
here
he
looked
at
steve
it
is
a
straggler
sir
from
my
regiment
lieutenant
randolph
picked
him
up
found
him
under
a
bridge
sir
i
call
him
a
deserter
steve
writhed
as
though
literally
the
eyes
were
cold
steel
and
had
pinned
him
down
gawd
general
i
did
desert
cross
my
heart
and
may
i
go
to
hell
if
i
did
i
was
awful
tired
hungry
and
thirsty
and
my
head
swimming
i
just
dropped
out
meaning
to
catch
up
after
a
bit
i
had
a
sore
foot
major
cleave
awful
hard
on
me
you
a
disgrace
to
your
company
said
cleave
if
we
did
not
need
even
shadows
and
half
men
you
would
be
drummed
home
to
thunder
run
there
to
brag
loaf
and
rot
steve
began
to
whine
i
meant
to
catch
up
i
truly
did
his
eyes
shifting
from
side
to
side
met
those
of
stafford
gawd
i
lost
stafford
regarded
his
quondam
prisoner
curiously
enough
his
gaze
had
in
it
something
of
cruelty
of
pondering
and
of
question
steve
writhed
i
ai
any
better
anybody
else
life
awful
everybody
in
the
world
agin
me
gawd
knows
major
cleave
so
cleave
made
a
sound
of
contempt
stafford
spoke
i
do
not
think
he
actually
a
deserter
i
remember
his
face
i
met
him
near
middletown
and
he
gave
me
his
regiment
and
company
there
are
many
stragglers
steve
could
have
fallen
and
worshipped
do
care
whether
he
did
it
for
me
or
jest
he
hates
that
other
one
he
does
hate
him
i
hate
him
too
sending
me
to
the
guardhouse
every
this
to
himself
outside
he
tried
to
look
as
though
he
had
carried
the
colours
from
front
royal
only
dropping
them
momentarily
at
that
unfortunate
bridge
jackson
regarded
him
with
a
eye
unreconciled
but
finally
made
his
peculiar
gesture
of
dismissal
the
thunder
run
man
saluted
and
stumbled
from
the
roadside
into
the
field
the
dead
musket
in
the
hollow
of
his
arm
his
face
turned
toward
company
a
back
in
the
road
jackson
turned
his
eyes
on
cleave
major
in
half
an
hour
you
will
advance
with
your
skirmishers
do
as
well
as
you
have
done
heretofore
and
you
will
do
well
very
well
the
effect
of
colonel
brooke
wound
is
graver
than
was
thought
he
has
asked
to
be
retired
after
winchester
you
will
have
your
promotion
with
his
staff
he
rode
away
a
leaf
brown
figure
looming
large
in
the
misty
half
light
against
the
red
guidons
of
the
east
stafford
went
with
him
randolph
his
cannoneers
and
drivers
dropped
beside
the
pieces
and
were
immediately
asleep
half
an
hour
now
was
all
they
had
the
horses
cropped
the
pearled
wayside
grass
far
away
the
cocks
were
crowing
in
the
east
the
red
bannerols
widened
there
came
a
faint
blowing
of
bugles
cleave
stooped
and
took
up
his
cloak
steve
stumbling
back
over
the
wet
field
between
the
ranks
of
sleeping
men
found
company
a
that
portion
of
it
not
with
the
skirmishers
every
soul
was
asleep
the
men
lay
heavily
some
drawn
into
a
knot
others
with
arms
flung
wide
others
on
their
faces
they
lay
in
the
dank
and
chilly
dawn
as
though
death
had
reaped
the
field
steve
lay
down
beside
them
gawd
when
will
this
war
be
over
he
dreamed
that
he
was
back
at
thunder
run
crouching
behind
a
certain
boulder
at
a
turn
of
the
road
that
wound
up
from
the
valley
he
had
an
old
flintlock
but
in
his
dream
he
did
not
like
it
and
it
changed
to
one
of
the
beautiful
modern
rifles
they
were
beginning
to
take
from
the
yankees
there
were
no
yankees
on
thunder
run
steve
felt
assured
of
that
in
his
dream
very
secure
and
comfortable
richard
cleave
came
riding
up
the
road
on
dundee
steve
lifted
the
rifle
to
his
shoulder
and
sighted
very
carefully
it
seemed
that
he
was
not
alone
behind
the
boulder
a
shadowy
figure
with
a
sword
and
a
star
on
his
collar
said
aim
at
the
heart
in
the
dream
he
fired
but
before
the
smoke
could
clear
so
that
he
might
know
his
luck
the
sound
of
the
shot
changed
to
clear
trumpets
long
and
wailing
steve
turned
on
his
side
reveille
o
gawd
the
men
arose
the
ranks
were
formed
breakfast
hairston
breckinridge

he
wild
about
a
girl
in
winchester
says
his
mother
and
sister

too
and
he
sleep
for
thinking
of
the
enemy
all
about
them
children
sure
do
grow
up
quick
in
war
time
a
lot
of
things
grow
up
quick
and
a
lot
of
things
do
grow
at
all
there
goes
the
long
and
steady
our
turn
next
steve
again
saw
from
afar
the
approach
of
the
nightmare
it
stood
large
on
the
opposite
bank
of
abraham
creek
and
he
must
go
to
meet
it
he
was
wedged
between
comrades
sergeant
coffin
was
looking
straight
at
him
with
his
melancholy
eyes
he
could
not
fall
out
drop
behind
the
backs
of
his
hands
began
to
grow
cold
and
his
unwashed
forehead
was
damp
beneath
matted
elf
locks
from
considerable
experience
he
knew
that
presently
sick
stomach
would
set
in
when
the
company
splashed
through
abraham
creek
he
would
not
look
at
the
running
water
but
when
he
looked
at
the
slopes
he
was
expected
presently
to
climb
he
saw
that
there
was
fighting
there
and
that
the
nightmare
attended
steve
closed
his
eyes
o
gawd
take
care
of
me
later
on
when
the
ridge
was
won
he
found
himself
still
in
the
company
of
the
nightmare
cowering
close
to
the
lock
of
a
rail
fence
that
zigzagged
along
the
crest
how
he
got
there
he
really
did
not
know
he
had
his
musket
still
clutched
his
mountaineer
instinct
served
for
that
presently
he
made
the
discovery
that
he
had
been
firing
had
fired
thrice
it
appeared
from
his
cartridge
box
he
remembered
neither
firing
nor
loading
though
he
had
some
faint
recollection
of
having
been
upon
his
knees
behind
a
low
stone
wall
he
saw
it
now
at
right
angles
with
the
rail
fence
a
clover
field
he
remembered
because
some
one
had
said
something
about
clovers
and
then
a
shell
had
come
by
and
the
clover
turned
red
seized
with
panic
he
bit
a
cartridge
and
loaded
the
air
was
rocking
moreover
with
the
heavier
waves
came
a
sharp
heaven
and
earth
blurred
together
blended
by
the
giant
brush
of
eddying
smoke
steve
tasted
powder
smelled
powder
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence
from
a
battery
lower
down
the
slope
to
the
guns
beyond
him
two
men
were
running
running
very
swiftly
with
bent
heads
they
ran
like
people
in
a
pelting
rain
and
between
them
they
carried
a
large
bag
or
bundle
slung
in
an
oilcloth
they
were
tall
and
hardy
men
and
they
moved
with
a
curious
air
of
determination
carrying
powder
gawd
before
i
be
sech
a
fool
a
shell
came
and
burst
burst
between
the
two
men
there
was
an
explosion
a
part
of
the
fence
was
wrecked
a
small
cedar
tree
torn
into
kindling
steve
put
down
his
musket
laid
his
forehead
upon
the
rail
before
him
and
vomited
the
guns
were
but
a
few
yards
above
him
planted
just
below
the
crest
their
muzzles
projecting
over
steve
recognized
rockbridge
he
must
he
thought
have
been
running
away
not
knowing
where
he
was
going
and
infernally
managed
to
get
up
here
the
nightmare
abode
with
him
his
joints
felt
like
water
his
heart
was
straightened
stretched
and
corded
in
his
bosom
like
a
man
upon
the
rack
he
pressed
close
into
the
angle
of
the
fence
made
himself
of
as
little
compass
as
his
long
and
gangling
limbs
allowed
and
held
himself
still
as
an
opossum
feigning
death
only
his
watery
blue
eyes
wandered
not
for
curiosity
but
that
he
might
see
and
dodge
a
coming
harm
before
him
the
ridge
ran
steeply
down
to
a
narrow
depression
a
little
vale
two
hundred
yards
across
on
the
further
side
the
land
rose
again
to
as
high
a
hill
here
was
a
stone
fence
which
even
as
he
looked
leaped
fire
above
it
were
ranged
the
blue
cannon
three
batteries
well
served
north
and
south
muzzle
to
muzzle
the
guns
roared
across
the
green
hollow
the
blue
musketrymen
behind
the
wall
were
using
minies
of
all
things
steve
most
hated
these
they
came
with
so
unearthly
a
sound
a
devil
noise
a
death
that
shrieked
taunted
and
triumphed
they
made
his
blood
like
water
he
crouched
close
a
mere
lump
of
demoralization
behind
a
veil
of
wild
buckwheat
rockbridge
was
suffering
heavily
both
from
the
opposing
parrotts
and
from
sharpshooters
behind
the
wall
a
belated
gun
came
straining
up
the
slope
the
horses
doing
mightily
the
men
cheering
there
was
an
opening
in
a
low
stone
wall
across
the
hillside
below
steve
the
gate
had
been
wrenched
away
and
thrown
aside
but
the
thick
gatepost
remained
and
it
made
the
passage
narrow
too
narrow
for
the
gun
team
and
the
carriage
to
pass
all
stopped
and
there
was
a
colloquy
we
got
an
axe
yes
captain
john
agnor
you
felled
many
a
tree
take
the
axe
and
cut
that
post
down
captain
i
will
be
killed
then
you
will
be
killed
doing
your
duty
john
get
down
agnor
got
the
axe
swung
it
and
began
chopping
the
stone
wall
across
the
hollow
blazed
more
fiercely
the
sharpshooters
diverted
their
attention
from
the
men
and
horses
higher
upon
the
hill
agnor
swung
the
axe
with
steadiness
the
chips
flew
far
the
post
was
cut
almost
through
before
his
bullet
came
in
falling
he
clutched
the
weakened
obstruction
and
the
two
came
down
together
the
gun
was
free
to
pass
and
it
passed
each
cannoneer
and
driver
looking
once
at
john
agnor
lying
dead
with
a
steady
face
it
found
place
a
few
yards
above
steve
in
his
corner
and
joined
in
the
roar
of
its
fellows
throwing
solid
shot
and
canister
a
hundred
yards
and
more
to
the
rear
stood
a
barn
the
wounded
from
all
the
guns
strung
like
black
beads
along
the
crest
dragged
themselves
or
were
carried
to
this
shelter
hope
rose
in
steve
heart
gawd
creep
through
the
clover
and
git
there
myself
he
started
on
hands
and
knees
but
once
out
of
his
corner
and
the
shrouding
mass
of
wild
buckwheat
terror
took
him
the
minies
were
singing
like
so
many
birds
a
line
of
blue
musketrymen
posted
behind
cover
somewhat
higher
than
the
grey
were
firing
alike
at
gunners
horses
and
the
men
passing
to
and
fro
behind
the
fighting
line
steve
saw
a
soldier
hobbling
to
the
barn
throw
up
his
arms
and
pitch
forward
two
carrying
a
third
between
them
were
both
struck
the
three
tried
to
drag
themselves
further
but
only
the
one
who
had
been
borne
by
the
others
succeeded
a
shell
pierced
the
roof
of
the
barn
burst
and
set
the
whole
on
fire
steve
turned
like
a
lizard
and
went
back
to
the
lock
of
the
fence
and
the
tattered
buckwheat
he
could
hear
the
men
talking
around
the
gun
just
beyond
they
spoke
very
loud
because
the
air
was
shaken
like
an
ocean
in
storm
they
were
all
clad
only
in
trousers
and
shirt
the
shirt
open
over
the
breast
and
sleeves
rolled
up
they
stood
straight
or
bent
or
crept
about
the
guns
all
their
movements
swift
and
rhythmic
sometimes
they
were
seen
clearly
sometimes
the
smoke
swallowed
them
when
seen
they
looked
larger
than
life
when
only
heard
their
voices
came
as
though
earth
and
air
were
speaking
sponge
all
right
fire
hot
while
it
lasts
but
it
wo
last
long
i
have
every
confidence
in
old
jack
and
old
dick
drat
that
primer
all
right
three
seconds
jerusalem
that
created
a
sensation
the
louisianians
are
coming
up
that
cleft
between
the
hills
all
the
stonewall
regiments
in
the
centre
ewell
to
flank
their
left

give
you
our
word
let
them
enfilade
ahead
but
you
better
go
back
sir
thank
you
captain
but
i
wish
to
see
a
minie
ball
imbedded
itself
in
a
rail
beside
steve
cheek
before
he
could
recover
from
this
experience
a
shell
burst
immediately
in
front
of
his
panel
he
was
covered
with
earth
a
fragment
of
shell
sheared
away
the
protecting
buckwheat
and
a
piece
of
rail
struck
him
in
the
back
with
force
he
yelled
threw
down
his
musket
and
ran
he
passed
john
agnor
lying
dead
by
the
gateway
and
he
reached
somehow
the
foot
of
the
hill
and
the
wide
fields
between
the
embattled
ridges
and
the
valley
pike
the
woods
and
the
front
royal
road
he
now
could
see
the
federal
line
of
battle
drawn
on
both
sides
of
the
pike
but
preponderantly
to
the
westward
they
were
there
horse
and
foot
and
bellowing
artillery
and
they
did
not
look
their
flags
were
flying
their
muskets
gleaming
they
had
always
vastly
more
and
vastly
better
bands
than
had

had
been
tending

was
asleep

gone
to
sleep
calling
her
maman
and
babbling
of
on

she
kissed
him
lightly
on
the
forehead
for
will

somewhere
on
the

battling
in
heat
and
dust
battling
for
the

who
little
more
than
a
year

her
baby
whom
she
kissed
each
night
when
he
went
to
sleep
in
his
little
room
next
hers
at
three
oaks
she
straightened
herself
and
looked
around
for
more
work
the
large
room
the
chamber
of
the
old
and
quiet
house
in
which
she
and
miriam
had
stayed
on
when
in
march
the
army
had
withdrawn
from
winchester
held
three
wounded
upon
the

and

a
dying
officer
his
wife
was
with
him
and
a
surgeon
who
had
found
the
ball
but
could
not
stop
the
hemorrhage
a
little
girl
sat
on
the
bed
and
every
now
and
then
put
forth
a
hand
and
timidly
stroked
her
wrist
on
the
floor
on
a
mattress
matching
the
one
on
which
the
boy
lay
was
stretched
a
gaunt
giant
from
some
backwoods
or
mountain
clearing
margaret
knelt
beside
him
and
he
smiled
up
at
her
i

and
i
ai

ef
this

cut
the
shirt
from
a
sabre
wound
with
the
scissors
hanging
at
her
waist
then
bringing
water
bathed
away
the
grime
and
dried
blood
you
right
she
said
it
is
much
of
a
cut
it
will
soon
heal
they
spoke
in
whispers
not
to
disturb
the
central
group
but
you
do
look
easy
you
are
still
suffering
what
is
it
it
ai
nothing

anybody
for

they
might
want
to
cut
it
off
she
looked
and
made
a
pitying
sound
the
officer
on
the
bed
had
now
breathed
his
last
she
brought
the
unneeded
surgeon
to
the
crushed
ankle
summoned
to
help
him
another
of
the
women
in
the
house
then
moved
to
the
and
aided
the
tearless
widow
young
and
soon
again
to
become
a
mother
to
lay
the
dead
calm
and
straight
the
little
girl
began
to
shake
and
shudder
she
took
her
in
her
arms
and
carried
her
out
of
the
room
she
found
miriam
helping
in
the
storeroom
get
the
child
doll
and
take
her
into
the
garden
for
a
little
while
she
is
cold
as

she
begins
to

do
stop
her
when
she
is

her
to

they
entered
a
room
together
the
parlour
this
time
with
the
windows
flung
wide
and
the
afternoon
sunlight
lying
in
pools
among
the
roses
of
the
carpet
two
mahogany
tables
had
been
put
together
and
the
soldier
lay
atop
the
crushed
leg
bared
and
waiting
the
surgeon
had
an
assistant
and
the
young
servant
was
praying
in
a
corner
margaret
uttered
a
low
pained
exclamation
this
young
lieutenant
had
been
well
liked
last
winter
in
winchester
he
had
been
much
at
this
house
he
had
a
good
voice
and
she
had
played
his
accompaniments
while
he
sang
oh
the
most
sentimental
of
ditties
miriam
had
liked
him
very
well
they
had
read
together
the
pilgrims
of
the
rhine
goldsmith
bernardin
de

he
had
a
trick
of
serenading
danced
well
she
put
her
cheek
down
to
his
hand
my
poor
poor
boy
my
poor
brave
boy
the
lieutenant
smiled
at
her
rather
a
twisted
smile
shining
out
of
a
drawn
white
face
i
got
to
be
brave
on
one
leg
anyhow
cleave
i
can
still
sing
and

the
assistant
placed
a
basin
and

of
his
head

late
in
the
afternoon
as
she
was
crossing
the
hall
upon
some
other
of
the
long
day
tasks
she
heard
a
group
of
soldiers
talking
there
were
infantry
officers
from
the
regiments
left
in
town
and
a
dusty
cavalryman
or
two
riders
from
the
front
with
dispatches
or
orders
one
with
an
old
cut
glass
goblet
of
water
in
his

talked
and

wait
old
dick

in

he
was
behind
took
the
aide
two
hours
to
find
him
sitting
on
rifle
swearing
because
he
did
see
the
cavalry
well
he
made
the
air
around
him
blue
and
sent
back
highly
orders
steuart
promptly
forward
vigorously
but
lord
banks
was
halfway
to
the
potomac
his
troops
streaming
by
every
cow
path
stonewall
and
the
infantry
advance
behind
him
but

touched
one
of
the

upon

swung
round
in
the

darkening
toward

and
swept
off
his
hat

a
nook
for
the
little
girl
and
put
her
to
bed
the
officers
went
away
there
were
a
thousand
things
to
do
and
also
they
must
snatch
some
sleep
or
the
brain
would
reel
the
surgeon
grey
with
fatigue
dropping
for

thank
you
i
see
the
step
i
come
back
about
midnight
the
old
yards
up
and
down
the
old
street
were
much
trampled
shrubbery
broken
fences
down
the
street
thick
dust
and
still
strewn
with
accoutrements
that
had
been
thrown
away
with
here
and
there
a
broken
wagon
street
and
pavement
there
was
passing
and
repassing
the
life
of
the
rear
of
an
army
and
the
faring
to
and
fro
on
many
errands
of
the
people
of
the
relieved
town
there
were
the
hospitals
and
there
were
the
wounded
in
private
houses
there
were
the
dead
and
all
the
burials
for
the
morrow
the
negroes
digging
in
the
old
graveyard
and
the
children
gathering
flowers
there
were
the
living
to
be
cared
for
the
many
hungry
to
be
fed
all
the
town
was
exalted
devoted
bent
on
service
a
little
city
raised
suddenly
to
a
mountain
platform
set
in
a
strange
high
light
fanned
by
one
of
the
oldest
winds
and
doing
well
with
a
clear
intensity
miriam
came
and
stood
beside
her
mother
leaning
her
head
upon
the
other
breast
the
two
seemed
like
elder
and
younger
sister
no
more
there
was
a
white
jasmine
over
the
porch
in
the
yard
the
fireflies
were
beginning
to
sparkle
through
the
dusk
dear
child
are
you
very
tired
i
am
not
tired
at
all
that
louisiana
boy
called
me
your
eyes
are
darker
but
your
lips
are
not
so
red
he
said
he
kept
all
my
letters
over
his
heart
only
he
tore
them
up
before
the
battle
tore
them
into
little
bits
and
gave
them
to
the
wind
so
that
if
he
fell
into
his
hands
might
not
read
them
the
doctor
says
that
he
will
do
well
he
is
like
will
oh
mother
i
feel
ten
thousand
years
old
i
feel
as
though
i
had
always
lived
i
too
dear
always
i
have
always
borne
children
and
they
have
always
gone
forth
to
war
they
say
there
will
be
no
fighting
she
put
her
daughter
slightly
from
her
and
leaned
forward
listening
that
is
richard
his
foot
strikes
that
way
upon
the
street
in
the
night
in
his
mother
chamber
cleave
waked
from
three
hours
of
dreamless
sleep
she
stood
beside
him
my
poor
dead
man
i
hated
to
keep
my
word
he
smiled
it
would
have
been
as
hard
to
wake
up
at
the
end
of
a
week
mother
i
am
so
dirty
the
servants
have
brought
you
plenty
of
hot
water
and
we
have
done
the
best
we
could
with
your
uniform
here
is
fresh
underwear
and
a
beautiful
shirt
i
went
myself
down
to
the
officer
in
charge
of
captured
stores
he
was
extremely
good
and
let
me
have
all
i
wished
tullius
is
here
he
came
in
an
hour
ago
with
dundee
i
will
send
him
up
when
you
are
dressed
come
into
the
hall
i
will
have
something
there
for
you
to
eat
richard
drew
her
hand
to
his
lips
i
wonder
who
first
thought
of
so
blessed
an
institution
as
a
mother
only
a
mother
could
have
thought
of
it
and
so
there
you
are
again
in
the
circle
when
he
was
dressed
he
found
in
the
wide
upper
hall
without
his
door
spread
upon
a
small
leaf
table
a
meal
frugal
and
delicate
a
breeze
came
through
the
open
window
and
with
it
the
scent
of
jasmine
the
wind
blew
the
candle
flame
until
his
mother
stepping
lightly
brought
a
glass
shade
and
set
it
over
the
silver
stick
small
moths
flew
in
and
out
and
like
a
distant
ground
swell
came
the
noise
of
the
fevered
town
the
house
itself
was
quiet
after
the
turmoil
of
the
day
large
halls
and
stair
in
dimness
the
ill
or
wounded
quiet
or
at
least
not
loudly
complaining
now
and
then
a
door
softly
opened
or
closed
a
figure
or
that
of
some
coloured
servant
passed
from
dimness
to
dimness
they
passed
and
the
whole
was
quiet
again
mother
and
son
spoke
low
i
will
not
wake
miriam
until
just
time
to
say
she
is
overwrought
poor
child
she
had
counted
so
on
seeing
will
we
will
press
on
now
i
think
to
harper
ferry
but
events
may
bring
us
this
way
again
the
is
bivouacked
by
a
little
stream
and
i
saw
him
fast
asleep
he
is
growing
strong
hardy
bronzed
it
is
striking
twelve
tullius
is
saddling
dundee
there
will
be
no
fighting
in
the
morning
no
not
perhaps
until
we
reach
harper
ferry
banks
will
get
across
to
williamsport
for
the
present
he
is
off
the
board
saxton
at
harper
ferry
has
several
thousand
men
and
he
will
be
at
once
heavily
reinforced
from
washington
it
is
well
for
us
and
for
richmond
that
that
city
is
so
nervous
general
jackson
is
doing
wonderful
work
is
he
not
richard
yes
it
is
strange
to
see
how
the
heart
of
the
army
has
turned
to
him
jack
can
do
no
wrong
but
he
is
not
satisfied
with
work
but
if
they
are
out
of
virginia
they
should
be
in
virginia
prisoners
of
war
it
was
a
cavalry
well
it
can
not
be
helped
will
you
cross
at
harper
ferry
with
all
my
heart
i
wish
we
might
defensive
war
should
always
be
waged
in
the
enemy
territory
but
i
am
certain
that
we
are
working
with
the
explicit
purpose
of
preventing
mcdowell
junction
with
mcclellan
and
the
complete
investment
of
richmond
which
would
follow
that
junction
we
are
going
to
threaten
washington
the
government
there
may
be
trusted
i
think
to
recall
mcdowell
probably
also
they
will
bring
upon
our
rear
fremont
from
the
south
branch
that
done
we
must
turn
and
meet
them
both
oh
war
over
a
year
now
it
has
lasted
there
are
so
many
in
black
and
the
church
bells
have
always
a
tolling
sound
and
then
the
flowers
bloom
and
we
hear
laughter
as
we
knit
all
colours
are
brighter
and
all
sounds
are
deeper
if
there
is
horror
there
is
also
much
that
is
not
horror
and
there
is
nobility
as
well
as
baseness
and
the
mind
adapts
itself
and
the
ocean
is
deeper
than
we
think
somewhere
of
course
lies
the
shore
of
brotherhood
and
beyond
that
the
shore
of
oneness
it
is
not
unlikely
i
think
that
we
may
reinforce
johnston
at
richmond
then
miriam
and
i
will
make
our
way
there
also
how
long
will
it
last
richard
the
war
it
may
last
one
year
and
it
may
last
ten
the
probability
is
perhaps
five
five
years
all
the
country
will
be
war
is
a
forge
mother
many
things
will
be
forged
more
of
iron
perhaps
than
of
gold
you
have
no
doubt
of
the
final
victory
if
i
ever
have
i
put
it
from
me
i
do
not
doubt
the
armies
nor
the
generals
and
god
knows
i
do
not
doubt
the
women
at
home
if
i
am
not
so
sure
in
all
ways
of
the
government
at
least
no
man
doubts
its
integrity
and
its
purpose
the
president
if
he
is
clear
and
narrow
rather
than
clear
and
broad
if
he
sometimes
plays
the
bigot
if
he
is
a
good
field
officer
rather
than
the
great
man
of
affairs
we
need
yet
he
is
earnest
disinterested
able
a
patriot
and
congress
does
its
best
is
at
least
eloquent
and
fires
the
heart
our
crowding
needs
are
great
and
our
resources
small
it
does
what
it
can
the
departments
work
hard
benjamin
mallory
randolph
meminger
they
are
all
good
men
and
the
railroad
men
and
the
engineers
and
the
chemists
and
the
mechanics
all
so
wonderfully
and
pathetically
ingenious
labouring
day
and
night
working
miracles
without
material
making
bricks
without
straw
arsenals
foundries
workshop
manufactories
all
in
a
night
out
of
the
wheat
fields
and
the
runners
of
blockades
and
the
river
steamer
men
the
special
agents
the
clerks
the
workers
of
all
kind
a
territory
large
as
europe
and
every
man
and
woman
in
the
field
in
one
aspect
or
another
if
patriotism
can
save
and
ability
fortitude
endurance
we
are
saved
and
yet
i
think
of
my
old
lives
and
of
all
the
causes
that
have
been
lost
and
sometimes
in
the
middle
of
the
night
i
see
all
our
blocked
ports
and
the
mississippi
slipping
from
our
hands
i
do
not
believe
that
england
will
come
to
our
help
there
is
a
sentiment
for
us
undoubtedly
but
like
the
island
mists
it
stays
at
home
he
rose
from
the
table
and
yet
the
brave
man
fights
and
must
hope
hope
is
the
sky
above
him
and
the
skies
have
never
really
fallen
i
do
not
know
how
i
will
come
out
of
war
i
know
how
i
went
into
it
but
no
man
knows
with
what
inner
change
he
will
come
out
enough
now
being
in
to
serve
with
every
fibre
she
shaded
her
eyes
with
her
hand
with
her
soft
brown
hair
with
her
slender
maturity
with
the
thin
fine
bit
of
lace
at
her
neck
against
the
blowing
curtains
and
in
the
jasmine
scent
she
suggested
something
fine
and
strong
and
sweet
of
old
time
of
all
time
i
know
that
you
will
serve
with
every
fibre
she
said
i
know
it
because
i
also
shall
serve
that
way
presently
she
dropped
her
hand
and
looked
up
at
him
with
a
face
young
soft
and
bright
lit
from
within
and
so
at
last
richard
you
are
happy
in
the
lovely
ways
he
put
something
in
her
hand
would
you
like
to
see
it
she
sent
it
to
me
two
weeks
ago
it
does
not
do
her
justice
margaret
laughed
they
never
do
but
i
agree
with
you
and
yet
it
is
lovely
her
eyes
were
always
wonderful
and
she
smiles
like
some
old
picture
i
shall
love
her
well
richard
and
she
you
mother
the
country
lies
on
my
heart
i
see
a
sky
and
many
graveyards
and
i
hear
now
now
a
dead
march
and
yet
through
it
all
there
runs
a
singing
stream
under
a
blue
heaven
a
little
later
miriam
having
waked
he
said
a
lingering
fond
and
leaving
them
both
at
the
gate
in
the
dead
hour
before
the
dawn
rode
away
on
dundee
tullius
following
him
down
the
pike
toward
the
sleeping
army
he
passed
the
pickets
and
came
to
the
first
regiment
before
dawn
to
the
just
as
the
red
signals
showed
in
the
east
it
was
a
dawn
like
yesterday
far
and
wide
lay
the
army
thousands
of
men
motionless
on
the
earth
acorns
fallen
from
the
tree
of
war
he
met
an
officer
plodding
through
the
mist
trying
to
read
in
the
dim
light
a
sheaf
of
orders
which
he
carried

richard

laughed
a

jest
and
determination
both
of

settled

at
sixteen
one
day
when
i
was
ploughing

how
they
all
look
scattered

reveille
sounded
and
the
army
arose
breakfast
was
a
sumptuous
thing
delicately
flavoured
with
compliments
upon
the
taste
range
and
abundance
of
the
federal
commissariat
roll
call
followed
with
the
moment
full
pause
after
names
that
were
not
answered
to
a
general
order
was
read
four
weeks
this
army
has
made
long
and
rapid
marches
fought
six
combats
and
two
battles
signally
defeating
the
enemy
in
each
one
captured
several
stands
of
colours
and
pieces
of
artillery
with
numerous
prisoners
and
vast
medical
ordnance
and
army
stores
and
finally
driven
the
host
that
was
ravaging
our
country
into
utter
rout
the
general
commanding
would
warmly
express
to
the
officers
and
men
under
his
command
his
joy
in
their
achievements
and
his
thanks
for
their
brilliant
gallantry
in
action
and
their
patient
obedience
under
the
hardship
of
forced
marches
often
more
painful
to
the
brave
soldier
than
the
dangers
of

the
explanation
of
the
severe
exertions
to
which
the
commanding
general
called
the
army
which
were
endured
by
them
with
such
cheerful
confidence
in
him
is
now
given
in
the
victory
of
yesterday
he
receives
this
proof
of
their
confidence
in
the
past
with
pride
and
gratitude
and
asks
only
a
similar
confidence
in
the
his
chief
duty
and
that
of
the
army
is
to
recognize
devoutly
the
hand
of
a
protecting
providence
in
the
brilliant
successes
of
the
last
three
days
and
to
make
the
oblation
of
our
thanks
to
god
for
his
mercies
to
us
and
to
our
country
in
heartfelt
acts
of
religious
worship
for
this
purpose
the
troops
will
remain
in
camp
suspending
as
far
as
practicable
all
military
exercises
and
the

hold

sat

it

the
subject
of

to
leave

clandestinely
has
had
some
attention
from
me
and
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
is
a
yankee
trick
that
should
have
immediate
attention
from
the
governmental
authorities
of
this
country
the
pretence
is
that
we
must
let
it
go
forward
to
buy
arms
and
munitions

and
i
fear
the
fate
of
the

the
destination
of
these

they
are

the

as

exist

to
make
every

to
diminish
its

this

george

at
the
risk
of
seeming
tedious
permit
me
to
say
that
my
impression
that
you
were
mistaken
last
night
in
your
recollection
of
the
extent
to
which
louis
napoleon
used
railroads
in
transporting
his
army
into
sardinia
is
this
morning
confirmed
by
a
gentleman
who
is
a
most
experienced
and
railroad
officer
and
is
also
the
most
devoted
student
of
geography
and
military
history
with
the
most
accurate
and
extraordinary
memory
for
every
detail
however
minute
of
battles
and
all
other
military
operations
that
i
have
ever
met
with
he
is
positive
in
his
recollection
that
not
less
than
and
probably
more
of
that
army
were
gradually
concentrated
at
toulon
and
sent
thence
by
sea
to
genoa
and
the
rest
were
during
some
weeks
being
concentrated
at
a
little
town
on
the
confines
of
france
and
italy
whence
they
were
transferred
partly
on
foot
and
partly
on
a
railroad
into
sardinia
the
capacity
of
a
railroad
adequately
equipped
like
the
european
railroads
may
be
moderately
computed
at
five
times
that
of
a
road
like
those
of
the
confederate
states
for
the
sudden
and
rapid
movement
of
a
vanguard
of
an
army
to
hold
in
check
an
enemy
till
reinforced
or
of
a
rear
guard
to
cover
a
retreat
or
of
any
other
portion
of
an
army
which
must
move
suddenly
and
rapidly
and
for
the
transportation
of
ordnance
ammunition
commissary
and
other
military
supplies
railroads
are
available
and
invaluable
to
an
army
and
when
these
objects
of
prime
necessity
are
attained
they
can
advantageously
carry
more
troops
according
to
the
amount
of
the
other
transportation
required
the
distance
their
force
and
equipment
etc
but
to
rely
on
them
as
a
means
of
transporting
any
large
body
of
troops
beside
what
is
needed
to
supply
and
maintain
them
is
certainly
a
most
dangerous
delusion
and
must
inevitably
result
in
the
most
grievous
disappointments
and
fatal
consequence
very
respectfully
and
truly
yours

me
to
advocate
the
opposite
theory
about
this
matter
for
troops
constitute
the
most
profitable
if
not
the
only
profitable
part
of
any
transportation
by
railroads
but
i
can
not
be
less
a
citizen
and
patriot
because
i
am
a

officer
good
good
the
next
jarrow
copy
of
resolutions
declaring
the
sense
of
congress
whereas
the
united
states
are
waging
war
against
the
confederate
states
with
the
avowed
purpose
of
compelling
the
latter
to
reunite
with
them
under
the
same
constitution
and
government
and
whereas
the
waging
of
war
with
such
an
object
is
in
direct
opposition
to
the
sound
republican
maxim
that
government
rests
upon
the
consent
of
the
governed
and
can
only
tend
to
consolidation
in
the
general
government
and
the
consequent
destruction
of
the
rights
of
the
states
and
whereas
this
result
being
attained
the
two
sections
can
only
exist
together
in
the
relation
of
the
oppressor
and
the
oppressed
because
of
the
great
preponderance
of
power
in
the
northern
section
coupled
with
dissimilarity
of
interest
and
whereas
we
the
representatives
of
the
people
of
the
confederate
states
in
congress
assembled
may
be
presumed
to
know
the
sentiments
of
said
people
having
just
been
elected
by
them
therefore
be
it
resolved
by
the
congress
of
the
confederate
states
of
america
that
this
congress
do
solemnly
declare
and
publish
to
the
world
that
it
is
the
unalterable
determination
of
the
people
of
the
confederate
states
in
humble
reliance
upon
almighty
god
to
suffer
all
the
calamities
of
the
most
protracted
war
just
so
that
will
do
for
this
packet
now

that
the
seat
of

will
be
changed
of
late
the
army
has
grown
like
a
rolling
snowball
perhaps
thirty
thousand
here
an

uttered
a
startled
laugh

a
large

nearer

the
time
good
determined
men
i
truly
feel
that
we
are
invincible
i

the
next
my
dear
fitzhugh
papers
reports
will
give
you
the
details
suffice
it
that
we
had
a
lovely
time
a
minie
drew
some
blood
from
me
not
much
and
spilt
in
a
good
cause
as
you
see
i
am
writing
with
my
left
hand
the
other
arm
in
a
sling
the
army
in
the
highest
spirits
south
going
north
on
a
visit
all
the
grey
bonnets
are
over
the
border
we
hear
that
all
of
you
in
and
about
richmond
are
in
excellent
health
and
spirits
and
that
in
the
face
of
the
young
napoleon
stronger
too
than
he
thinks
we
hear
that
mcdowell
is
somewhere
between
you
and
fredericksburg
just
keep
him
there

you
rather
not
have
him
up
here
just
yet
give
my
love
to
all
my
cousins
will
write
the
other
side
of
the
yours
as
ever
peter
francisco
of
course
this
is
not
official
but
the
impression
is
strong
in
the
army
that
the
defensive
has
been
dropped
and
that
the
geese
in
the
other
capitol
ought
to
be
cackling
if
they
are
not
jarrow
drew
the
whole
together
i
thought
the
three
would
be
enough
sir
i
never
like
to
overdo
you
have
the
correct
idea
jarrow
bring
the

the
black

went
far
ahead
with
his
cavalry
the
army
moved
with
vigour
in
high
spirits
and
through
fine
weather
a
bright
cool
day
with
round
white
clouds
in
an
intense
blue
sky
when
halts
were
made
and
the
generals
rode
by
the
resting
troops
they
were
loudly
cheered
the
men
were
talkative
they
indulged
in
laughter
and
lifted
voice
in
song
speculation
ran
to
and
fro
but
she
wore
no
anxious
mien
the
army
felt
a
calm
confidence
a
mood
it
had
come
into
a
childlike
trust
in
its
commanding
general
and
that
made
all
the
difference
in
the
world
where
are
we
going

it
altogether
a
merchant
from
martinsburg
well
known
came
to
inform
me
that
in
a
confidential
conversation
with
a
very
prominent
secessionist
also
merchant
of
that
town
he
was
informed
that
the
policy
of
the
south
was
changed
that
they
would
abandon
richmond
virginia
everything
south
and
invade
maryland
and
washington
that
every
union
soldier
would
be
driven
out
of

the
party
talking
one
who

know
the
rebel
plans
a
prisoner
was
captured
near

he
told
the
truth
i
am
satisfied
as
far
as
he
pretended
to
know
he
was
in
the
fight
at
front
royal
and
passed
through
winchester
two
hours
after
our
engagement
he
says
the
rebel
force
was
very
large
not
less
than
thousand
at
winchester
and
or
at
front
royal
that
the
idea
was
general
among
the
men
that
they
were
to
invade
maryland
he
passed
ashby
yesterday
who
had
companies
of
cavalry
under
his

returning
from

and
moving
under
orders
his
men
said
to
berryville
there
were
rebels
at
martinsburg
when
he
passed
that
town
yesterday
these
reports
came
to
me
at
the
same
time
i
received

and
the
statement
from
my

friday
evening
the
thirtieth
was
as
dark
as
erebus
clouds
had
been
boiling
up
since
dark
huge
portentous
masses
rose
on
all
sides
and
blotted
out
the
skies
the
air
was
for
a
time
oppressively
hot
and
still
the
smoke
from
the
guns
which
had
wrangled
during
the
day
long
and
loud
hung
low
the
smell
of
powder
clung
the
grey
troops
massed
on
loudoun
heights
and
along
the
shenandoah
wiped
the
sweat
from
their
brows
against
the
piled
clouds
burned
dull
and
red
stars
of
war
communicating
through
the
sultry
night
the
clouds
rose
higher
yet
and
the
lightnings
began
to
play
a
stir
began
in
the
leaves
of
the
forests
blended
with
the
murmur
of
the
rivers
and
became
rushing
sound
thunder
burst
clap
after
clap
reverberating
through
the
mountains
the
air
began
to
smell
of
rain
grew
suddenly
cool
through
the
welcome
freshness
the
grey
troops
advanced
beyond
bolivar
heights
there
followed
a
long
crackle
of
musketry
and
a
body
of
blue
troops
retreated
across
the
river
the
guns
opened
again
the
grey
cannon
trained
upon
the
maryland
heights
the
maryland
heights
answering
sullenly
down
came
the
rain
in
torrents
the
lightning
flashed
the
thunder
rolled
the
lightnings
came
jaggedly
bayonets
of
the
storm
stabbing
downward
the
artillery
of
the
skies
dwarfed
all
sound
below
for
an
hour
there
was
desultory
fighting
then
it
ceased
the
grey
troops
awaiting
orders
wondered
are
we
going
to
cross
the
river
after
them
oh
let
it
alone

toward
midnight
in
the

fighting
was
renewed
it
was
not
for
long
the

fell
silent
again
upon

ashby

ashby

were
alike
smarting
from
a
late
rebuke
administered
in
general
orders
they
felt
it
stingingly
the
confederate
soldier
enthroned
on
high
his
personal
honour
and
a
slur
there
was
a
slur
indeed
now
the
memory
of
the
reprimand
was
a
strong
spur
to
endeavour
the

meant
to
distinguish
itself

pined
for

with
pride

made

made
a

the

like

the
rest
was
not
long
between

the

were
again
in

a

had
come
from

winder
you

press
silent
with
long
steady
swinging
tread
the
stonewall
moved
up
the
valley
before
it
pale
undulating
mysterious
beneath
the
stars
ran
the
turnpike
the
wonderful
valley
road
the
highway
that
had
grown
familiar
to
the
army
as
its
hand
the
army
of
the
valley
endowed
the
valley
pike
with
personality
they
spoke
of
it
as
her
they
blamed
her
for
mud
and
dust
for
shadeless
waterless
stretches
for
a
habit
she
was
acquiring
of
furrows
and
worn
places
for
the
aid
which
she
occasionally
gave
to
hostile
armies
for
the
hills
which
she
presented
for
the
difficulties
of
her
bordering
stone
walls
when
troops
must
be
deployed
for
the
weeds
and
nettles
thistles
and
briars
with
which
she
had
a
trick
of
decking
her
sides
for
her
length
you
kin
march
most
to
kingdom
come
on
this
here
old
road
for
the
heat
of
the
sun
the
chill
of
the
frost
the
strength
of
the
blast
in
blander
moods
they
caressed
her
name
wish
i
could
see
the
old
pike
once
more
any
road
in
the
world
like
the
valley
pike
and
never
was
never
behaved
herself
like
this
damned
drunken
zigzag
cow
track
it
was
not
only
the
road
all
nature
had
new
aspects
for
the
confederate
soldier
day
by
day
a
deeper
shade
of
personality
so
much
of
him
was
farmer
that
he
was
no
stranger
to
the
encampment
of
the
earth
he
was
knew
the
soil
named
the
trees
could
himself
had
a
fighting
knowledge
too
of
blight
and
drouth
hail
frost
high
wind
flood
too
little
and
too
much
of
sun
fire
probably
he
had
thought
that
he
knew
all
that
was
to
be
told
when
he
volunteered
it
was
not
with
the
expectation
of
learning
any
other
manual
than
that
of
arms
as
is
generally
the
case
he
learned
that
what
he
expected
was
but
a
mask
for
what
he
did
not
expect
he
learned
other
manuals
among
them
that
of
earth
air
fire
and
water
his
ideas
of
the
four
underwent
modification
first
of
all
he
learned
that
they
were
combatants
active
participants
in
the
warfare
which
he
had
thought
a
matter
only
of
armies
clad
in
blue
and
armies
clad
in
grey
apparently
nothing
was
passive
nothing
neutral
bewilderingly
also
nothing
was
of
a
steadfast
faith
sun
moon
darkness
and
light
heat
and
cold
snow
rain
mud
dust
mountain
forest
hill
dale
stream
bridge
road
wall
house
dew
mist
storm
everything
they
fought
first
on
one
side
then
on
the
other
sometimes
they
did
this
in
rapid
succession
sometimes
they
seemed
to
fight
on
both
sides
at
once
the
only
attitude
they
never
took
was
one
immaterial
to
the
business
in
hand
moreover
they
were
vitally
for
or
against
the
individual
soldier
now
his
friend
now
his
foe
now
flattering
caressing
bringing
gifts
now
snatching
away
digging
pitfalls
working
wreck
and
ruin
they
were
stronger
than
he
strong
and
capricious
beyond
all
reckoning
sometimes
he
loved
these
powers
sometimes
he
cursed
them
indifference
only
was
gone
he
and
they
were
alike
sentient
active
conscious
inextricably
mingled
the
pike
was
cool
and
hard
there
were
clouds
above
but
not
heavy
streams
of
stars
ran
between
to
either
side
of
the
road
lay
fields
of
wheat
of
clover
of
corn
banded
and
broken
by
shadowy
forest
massanutton
loomed
ahead
there
was
a
wind
blowing
together
with
the
sound
of
marching
feet
the
jingle
of
accoutrements
the
striking
of
the
horses
hoofs
against
loose
stones
the
heavy
noise
of
the
guns
in
the
rear
it
filled
the
night
like
the
roar
of
a
distant
cataract
the
men
marched
along
without
speech
now
and
then
a
terse
order
nothing
more
the
main
army
was
before
them
at
strasburg
they
must
catch
up
to
the
west
somewhat
near
at
hand
in
the
darkness

be
lying

somewhere
in

to

jackson
and
his

passing
between
the
upper
and
the
nether
millstone
which
should
have
joined
to
crush
the

began
to
pale
the
east
to
redden
faintly
faintly
the
swell
and
roll
of
the
earth
gathered
colour
a
cock
crew
from
some
distant
farmhouse
the
stonewall
swung
on
the
leading
its
colonel
richard
cleave
at
its
head
the
regiment
liked
to
see
him
there
it
loved
him
well
and
obeyed
him
well
and
he
in
his
turn
would
have
died
for
his
men
undoubtedly
he
was
responsible
for
much
of
the
tone
and
temper
it
was
good
stuff
in
the
beginning
but
something
of
its
firm
modelling
was
due
to
the
man
now
riding
dundee
at
its
head
the
was
acquiring
a
reputation
and
that
in
a
brigade
whose
deeds
had
been
ringing
like
a
great
bell
sonorously
through
the
land
the
good
conduct
of
the
the
reliable
always
the
with
its
accustomed
courage
the
disciplined
intelligent
and
courageous
the
gallantry
of
the

strengthened
pickets
were
reached
they
belonged

lying
in

to
either
side
of

the

passed
them
still
figures
against
the

ahead
lay
strasburg
its
church
spires
in
the
morning
air
later
as
the
sun
pushed
a
red
rim
above
the
hills
the
brigade
stacked
arms
in
a
fair
green
meadow
between
it
and
the
town
lay
taliaferro
elzey
and
campbell
were
in
the
fields
to
the
east
general
jackson
and
his
staff
occupied
a
knoll
just
above
the
road
the
stonewall
fell
to
getting
breakfast
big
tin
cups
of
scalding
coffee
sugar
fresh
meat
double
allowance
of
meal
they
broiled
the
meat
on
sharpened
sticks
using
the
skillets
for
batter
bread
they
grinned
at
the
sugar
before
they
dropped
it
in
they
purred
over
the
coffee
mingling
with
the
entrancing
odours
was
the
consciousness
of
having
marched
well
fought
well
deserved
well
down
the
pike
where
taylor
kept
the
rear
burst
a
rattle
of
musketry
the
stonewall
scrambled
to
its
feet

to
the
sound
of

up
the

there
was
skirmishing
in
plenty
dashes
by

repulsed
by

sunset
came
a
splendid
flare
of
colour
behind
the
great

the
army
halted
for
the
night
the
louisiana
brigade
still
formed
the

drawn
upon

to
either

of

it
lighted
no

and
rested
on
its

next
it

the
night
was
clear
and
dark
the

a
pale

gleam
between
the
shadowy

there
sounded
a
clattering
of

somewhere
on

firing
burst
out
on

it
proved
an
affair
of

later
shots
rang
out
close
at
hand
fremont
having
ordered
a
cavalry
reconnoissance
the
grey
met
it
with
clangour
and
pushed
it
back
wheat
battalion
was
ordered
northward
and
went
swinging
down

the

swarmed
again
whereupon

a

gun
it
had
intent
to
rake
the

but
was
trained
too
high
the
shells
hurtled
overhead
exploding
high
in

the
cannonade
ceased
as
suddenly
as
it
had
begun
day
began
to
break
in
violet
and
daffodil
as
the
hours
went
on
they
became

hot
and
dry
the

cloud
was
high
again

with

the

horribly

all
suffered

there
was
no

fremont
using

hung
upon

passed
up

blue

menaced

deployed

with

the

a
minute
later
jackson
appeared
wherever
matters
drew
suddenly
to
a
point
there
he
was
miraculously
found
he
looked
at
the

and
jerked
his

in
the

the

undisturbed
the
second
of
june
burned
onward
to
its
close
through
heat
dust
thirst
and
relentlessly
rapid
marching
in
the
late
afternoon
occurred
a
monstrous
piling
up
of
thunder
clouds
a
whistling
of
wind
and
a
great
downpour
of
rain
it
beat
down
the
wheat
and
pattered
like
elfin
bullets
on
the
forest
leaves
through
this
fusillade
the
army
came
down
to
the
west
fork
of
the
shenandoah
pioneers
laid
a
bridge
of
wagons
and
brigade
by
brigade
the
army
crossed
high
on
the
bank
in
the
loud
wind
and
dashing
rain
jackson
on
little
sorrel
watched
the
transit
by
dusk
all
were
over
and
the
bridge
was
taken
up
on
the
further
shore
ashby
now
kept
guard
between
fremont
and
the
host
in
grey
as
for
shields
he
was
on
the
far
side
of
the
massanuttons
before
him
a
bridgeless
swollen
torrent
and
a
guarded
mountain
pass
before
becoming
dangerous
he
must
move
south
and
round
the
massanuttons
far
from
achieving
junction
space
had
widened
between
shields
and
fremont
the
army
of
the
valley
had
run
the
gauntlet
and
in
doing
so
had
pushed
the
walls
apart
the
men
climbing
from
the
shenandoah
saluting
their
general
above
them
there
in
the
wind
and
the
rain
thought
the
voice
with
which
he
answered
them
unusually
gentle
he
almost
always
spoke
to
his
troops
gently
but
there
was
almost
a
fatherly
tone
and
though
he
jerked
his
hand
into
the
air
it
was
meditatively
done
a
quiet
salute
to
some
observant
commander
up
there
later
in
the
deep
darkness
the
army
bivouacked
near
new
market
headquarters
was
established
in
an
old
mill
here
a
dripping
courier
unwrapped
from
a
bit
of
cloth
several
leaves
of

paper
of
the
confederacy
and
gave
them
into
the
hand
next

at

there
has
been
a
great
battle
before

at
a
place
called

day
before

general
johnston
attacked

the

raged
all
day
with
varying
fortune
at
sunset
general
johnston
in
the
thickest
of
the
fight
was
struck
from
his

by

he
is
desperately
wounded
the

general

the
battle
was
resumed
yesterday
morning
and
lasted
until
late
in
the
day
each
side
claims
the
victory
our
loss
is
perhaps
five
thousand
we
hold
that
the
enemy
was
as
great

the

across

up

showed

massing
beneath

were

of

the
roaring

the

the

somewhat
dulled

a
tall
man
with

and
marvellously
long
moustaches
sat
his

beneath

he
pointed
to

up

down
the

there
the

could
play
at
that
game
the
flash
from

the
rattle
of

were
met
from
the
southern
by
as
vivid
a
leaping
spark
as
loud

look
at

no

he
says

precious
the

leader
put
to
his
lips
the
fairy
clarion
slung
from
his
shoulder
and
sounded
the
retreat
the
flaming
bridge
lit
all
the
place
and
showed
the
great
black
horse
and
him
upon
it
the
english
adventurer
across
the
water
had
with
him
sharpshooters
in
the
light
that
wavered
leaped
and

sprang
again

to

succeeded

ashby
dropped
the

threw
his

over

sprang

sank

no
i

not
hurt
but
black

he
stroked
black
conrad
kissed
him
between

and
drew
his
pistol
chew
fired
the
blakeley
again
drowning
all
lesser
sound
suddenly
the
supports
of
the
bridge
gave
way
a
great
part
of
the
roaring
mass
fell
into
the
stream
the
remainder
toward
the
southern
shore
flamed
higher
and
higher
the
long
rattle
of
the
federal
carbines
had
an
angry
sound
they
might
have
marched
more
swiftly
after
all
seeing
that
stonewall
jackson
would
not
march
more
slowly
build
a
bridge
how
could
they
build
a
bridge
over
the
wide
stream
angry
itself
hoarsely
and
violently
thrusting
its
way
under
an
inky
tempestuous
sky
they
had
no
need
to
spare
ammunition
and
so
they
fired
recklessly
cannon
carbine
and
revolvers
into
the
night
after
the
grey
retiring
squadrons
stafford
no
great
favourite
with
the
mass
of
the
men
but
well
liked
by
some
rode
beside
a
fellow
officer
this
was
a
man
genial
and
shrewd
who
played
the
game
of
war
as
he
played
that
of
whist
eyes
half
closed
and
memory
holding
every
card
he
spoke
cheerfully
shenandoah
beautifully
swollen
do
believe
fremont
has
pontoons
he
out
of
the
reckoning
for
at
least
a
day
and
a
night
probably
longer
nice
for
us
all
it
has
been
a
remarkable
campaign
tell
you
what
it
like
stafford
it
like
napoleon
italian
campaign
you
think
so
well
it
may
be
true
hear
the
wind
in
the
pines
tell
you
what
you
lack
stafford
you
lack
interest
in
the
war
you
are
too
damned
perfunctory
you
take
orders
like
an
automaton
and
you
go
execute
them
like
an
automaton
i
do
say
that
they
not
beautifully
executed
they
are
but
the
soul
not
there
the
other
day
at
tom
brook
i
watched
you
walk
your
horse
up
to
the
muzzle
of
that
fellow
wyndham
guns
and
by
god
i
do
believe
you
knew
any
more
than
an
automaton
that
the
guns
were
there
yes
i
did
well
you
may
have
known
it
with
one
half
of
your
brain
you
with
the
other
half
to
a
certain
extent
i
can
read
your
hand
got
a
big
war
of
your
own
in
a
country
of
your
own
eh
perhaps
you
are
not
altogether
wrong
such
things
happen
sometimes
yes
they
do
but
i
think
it
a
pity
this
war
he
jerked
his
head
toward
the
environing
night
is
big
enough
with
horribly
big
stakes
if
i
were
you
i
drum
the
individual
out
of
camp
think
only
of
the
general
i
wish
i
could
well
ca
you
no
not
yet
there
are
only
two
things
barring
disease
which
can
so
split
the
brain
in
two
send
the
biggest
part
off
or
saracen
into
some
country
and
keep
the
other
piece
here
in
virginia
to
crack
invaders
skulls
one
love
and
one
hate
never
both
and
saracen
in
one
that
difficult
nothing
is
so
difficult
as
life
nor
so
strange
and
perhaps
love
and
hate
are
both
illnesses
sometimes
i
think
so
a
happy
recovery
then
you
are
too
good
a
fellow
i
am
not
a
good
fellow
you
are
not
at
least
an
amiable
one
do
let
the
fever
get
too
high
will
you
listen
said
stafford
to
the
wind
in
the
pines
and
did
you
ever
see
the
automatic
two
days

having
bridged

the
blakeley
and
the

spoke
in

breath
while
the
echoes
were
yet
thundering
burst
a
fierce
volley
from
all
the
confederate
short
rifles
down
went
the

down
went
other
troopers
in

down

their
headlong
gallop
they
surged
upon
and
over

the
blakeley
blazed
again
and
the
grey
carbines
rang
the
englishman
was
on

and
was
shouting
like

savage
urging
the

on
and
up
for
the
third

the

flamed
and
rang
the
blue
lines

some

wyndham
ashby
put
his

to
his
lips
clear
and
sweet
rose
the
notes
a
silver
tempest
ashby
shouted
the
grey
lines
and
charged
ashby
out
of
the
woods
and
down
the
hill
they
came
like
undyked
waters
the
two
tides
met
and
clashed
there
followed
a
wild
melee
a
shouting
an
unconscious
putting
forth
of
great
muscular
energy
a
seeing
as
through
red
glasses
besmirched
with
powder
smoke
a
poisonous
odour
a
sense
of
cotton
in
the
mouth
a
feeling
as
of
struggle
on
a
turret
far
far
up
with
empty
space
around
and
below
the
grey
prevailed
the
blue
turned
and
fled
for
a
moment
it
seemed
as
though
they
were
flying
through
the
air
falling
falling
the
grey
had
a
sense
of
dizziness
as
they
struck
spur
in
flank
and
pursued
headlong
all
seemed
to
be
sinking
through
the
air
then
suddenly
they
felt
ground
exhaled
breath
and
went
thundering
up
the
port
republic
road
toward
harrisonburg
in
front
strained
the
blue
presently
reaching
the
wood
a
gun
boomed
from
a
slope
beyond
ashby
checked
the
pursuit
and
listened
to
the
report
of
a
vedette
fremont
pushing
forward
horse
and
guns
and
the
german
division
hm
he
sat
the

the

the

numbered
four
officers
and
forty

they
were
all
in
a
group
in
the
sunshine
which
lay
with
softness
upon
the
short
grass
and
the
little
pine
trees
the
dead
lay
huddled
while
over
them
flitted
the
butterflies
ashby
surgeons
were
busy
with
the
wounded
a
man
with
a
shattered
jaw
was
making
signs
deliberately
talking
in
the
alphabet
which
perhaps
he
had
learned
for
some
friend
or
relative
sake
a
younger

his

clenched
over

a

drew
himself
out
of
the
sun
under
one
of
the
little

died
some
of

gleaming
in

their

flags
azure
and

and
beside

streaming
the
red
with
the

cross
as
they
approached
there
also
began
to
show
at
the
edge
of
the
forest
which
cut
the
western
horizon
the
federal
horse
and
foot
before
these
was
a
space
of
rolling
fields
then
a
ragged
line
of
timber
a
straggling
copse
of
underbrush
and
tall
trees
cresting
a
wave
of
earth
a
body
of
blue
cavalry
started
out
of
the
wood
across
the
field
at
once
chew
opened
with
the
blakeley
and
the
two
parrotts
there
ensued
confusion
and
the
horse
fell
back
a
blue
infantry
regiment
issued
at
a
run
crossed
the
open
and
attained
the
cover
of
the
coppice
which
commanded
the
road
and
the
eastern
stretch
of
fields
a
second
prepared
to
follow
the
maryland
line
swung
through
the
woods
with
orders
to
flank
this
movement
ashby
galloped
to
the
forward
and
clear
that

he
rode
on
to

at

of

i

they
leave

the
advanced
steadily
over

open
when
it
was
almost
upon
the
coppice
it
fired
then
fixed

the
discharge
had
been
aimed
at
the
wood
merely
the
shadows
were
lengthening
the
undergrowth
was
thick
they
could
not
see
their
opponents
suddenly
the
coppice
blazed
a
and
fatal
volley
the
regiment
that
held
this
wood
had
a
good
record
and
meant
to
better
it
its
target
was
visible
enough
and
close
full
before
it
in
the
last
golden
light
a
grey
officer
fell

that
he
had
brandished

desperately
continued
its

the

the

seized
the

another

down
there
were
gaps
in

under

and
the

reached
the

of
the

there
was
disorder
wavering
from
underfoot
groans
and
cries
so
wrapped
in
smoke
was
the
scene
so
dusk
with
the
ragged
and
mournful
woods
hiding
the
low

that
it

the

in

when

drew

retreating
sullenly
to

the

were
all
out
when

carried

to

he
lay
at
midnight
in
a
room
of
an
old

of

they
had
laid
him
upon
a
narrow
bed
an

with

and
valance
the
white
canopy
above
the
fall
of
the

below
had
an
effect
of

the
whole
looked
like
an
old

in
some
dim
abbey
the

was
half
in

half
in

the

had

there
was
no

he
lay
in

upon

his

beside
him
his

in

his

watched
in
the

seated
with
bowed
heads
beside
the
open
window
an
hour
before
dawn
some
one
spoke
to
the
sentry
without
the

then
gently
turned
the
handle
and
entered
the
chamber
the

arose
stood
at

this

there
was

the

watched
both

of
the

the

rested
in
the
rich

that
covered

a

looked
down
upon

from

and
upon
the
road
by
which
shields
must
emerge
from
the

the

officer
looking
through
his

saw
also
a
road
that
ran
from

by
brown

over
the

ridge
into

and
along
this
road
moved

war
a
short
word
to
say
all
it
says
fremont
rested
at
harrisonburg
after
yesterday
repulse
on
the
other
side
of
massanutton
was
shields
moving
south
from

under
the
remarkable
impression
that
jackson
was
at
rude
hill
and
fremont
effectively
dealing
with
the
demoralized
rebels
on
the
sixth
he
began
to
concentrate
his

on

on

in

the
enemy
has
flung
away
everything
and
their
stragglers
fill
the

they
need
only
a
movement
on
the
flank
to
them
and
break
them
into
fragments
no
man
has
had
such
a
chance
since

commenced
you
are
within

of

who
still
hangs
together
ten
thousand
germans
are
on
his
rear
who
hang
on
like
bull
dogs
you
have
only
to
throw
yourself
down
on
waynesborough
before
him
and
your
cavalry
will
capture
thousands
seize
his
train
and
abundant
supplies
in
chase
of
this
so
beautiful
a
chance
shields
set
forth
down
the
eastern
side
of
massanutton
with
intent
to
round
the
mountain
at
port
republic
turn
north
again
and
somewhere
on
the
valley
pike
make
that
junction
with
fremont
and
stamp
out
rebellion
but
of
late
it
had
rained
much
and
the
roads
were
muddy
and
the
streams
swollen
his
army
was
split
into
sections
here
a
brigade
and
there
a
brigade
the
advance
south
of
conrad
store
the
rear
yet
at
luray
he
had
however
the
advantage
of
moving
through
leagues
of
forest
heavy
shaggy
dense
it
was
not
easy
to
observe
the
details
of
his
operations
sunday
morning
dawned
a
pearly
mist
wrapped
the
north
fork
and
the
south
fork
of
the
shenandoah
and
clung
to
the
shingle
roofs
and
bowery
trees
of
the
village
between
the
south
fork
was
shallow
and
could
be
forded
the
north
fork
was
deep
and
strong
and
crossed
by
a
covered
bridge
toward
the
bridge
now
winding
down
from
the
height
on
which
the
brigade
had
camped
came
a
detail
from
the
twenty
men
led
by
sergeant
mathew
coffin
they
were
chiefly
company
a
men
and
they
were
going
to
relieve
the
pickets
along
the
south
fork
thanks
to
commissary
banks
they
had
breakfasted
well
the
men
were
happy
not
hilariously
so
but
in
a
placid
equable
fashion
as
they
came
down
over
the
wet
grass
from
the
bluff
they
talked
mist
over
the
shenandoah
just
like
mist
over
the
james
no
is
like
mist
over
the
james
well
the
bridge
like
the
bridge
at
home
anyway
is
much
like
it
has
got
sidewalks
inside
yes
it
has
no
it

i
know
better
i
been
through
it
been
through
it
was
through
it
after
elk
run
a
month
ago

has
you
mistaken
i

nohow
if
i
was
at
home
i
thrash
you
mathew
coffin
turned
his
head
who
that
jowering
back
there
stop
it
sunday
morning
and
all
he
went
on
holding
his
head
straight
a
trig
slender
figure
breathing
irritation
his
oval
face
with
its
little
black
moustache
was
set
as
hard
as
its
boyish
curves
permitted
and
his
handsome
dark
eyes
had
two
parallel
lines
above
them
he
marched
as
he
marched
always
nowadays
with
a
mien
aggrieved
and
haughty
he
never
lost
the
consciousness
that
he
was
wearing
chevrons
who
had
worn
bars
and
he
was
quite
convinced
that
the
men
continually
compared
his
two
states
the
progress
down
hill
to
the
bridge
was
short
before
the
party
the
long
structure
loomed
through
the
mist
the
men
entered
and
found
it
dusk
and
warm
smelling
of
horses
the
river
fifteen
feet
below
showing
through
the
cracks
between
the
heavy
logs
of
the
floor
the
marching
feet
sounded
hollowly
voices
reverberated
just
like
our
bridge
told
you
was
ai
it
like
billy
maydew
it
air
said
billy
i
air
certainly
glad
that
we
air
on
a
bridge
the
shenandoah
air
a
to
swim
how
did
you
feel
billy
when
you
got
away
at
first
just
like
school
was
out
said
billy
but
when
a
whole
picket
post
started
after
me
i
run
fer
it
the
trees
put
out
arms
to
stop
me
the
dewberry
crawling
on
the
ground
said
to
itself
let
make
a
trap
when
the
rail
fences
all
hollered
out
goin
to
turn
agin
you
when
a
bit
of
swamp
hollered
louder
than
any
suck
down
billy
maydew
suck
down
billy
maydew
when
a
lot
o
bamboo
vines
running
over
cedars
up
with
him
fast
until
you
hear
a
bullet
whizzing
i
got
to
the
shenandoah
and
there
no
bridge
the
shenandoah
says
just
as
soon
drown
men
as
look
at
them
when
all
them
things
talked
so
i
knew
just
how
the
critturs
feel
in
the
woods
i
ai
so
crazy
about
hunting
as
i
was
and
i
say
again
this
here
air
a
most
bridge
with
his
musket
butt
he
struck
the
boarded
side
the
noise
was
so
resoundingly
greater
than
he
had
expected
that
he
laughed
and
the
men
with
him
now
sergeant
mathew
coffin
was
as
nervous
as
a
witch
he
had
been
marching
along
with
his
thoughts
moodily
hovering
over
the
battery
he
would
take
almost
or
the
ambush
he
would
dislodge
and
so
procure
promotion
indeed
at
the
noise
of
the
stick
he
started
violently
who
did
that
oh
i
see
and
i
might
have
known
it
report
you
for
extra
duty
report
ahead
said
billy
under
his
breath
coffin
halted
what
was
that
you
said
maydew
i
did
speak
to
you
sir
well
you
speak
to
me
now
what
was
it
you
said
then
he
came
nearer
his
arm
thrown
up
though
but
in
an
angry
gesture
if
i
struck
you
thought
billy
i
be
sorry
for
it
so
i
wo
do
it
but
one
thing
sure
i
certainly
should
like
to
if
you
do
answer
me
said
coffin
thickly
i
report
you
for
disobedience
as
well
as
for
disorderly
conduct
what
was
it
you
said
then
i
said
ahead
and
be
damned
to
you
coffin
lips
shut
hard
very
good
we
see
how
three
days
of
guardhouse
tastes
to
you
forward
the
party
cleared
the
bridge
and
almost
immediately
found
itself
in
the
straggling
village
street
the
mist
clung
here
as
elsewhere
houses
and
trees
dim
shapes
the
surrounding
hills
and
the
dense
woods
beyond
the
south
fork
hardly
seen
at
all
coffin
marched
with
flushed
face
and
his
brows
drawn
together
he
was
mentally
writing
a
letter
on
pale
blue
paper
and
in
it
he
was
enlarging
upon
ingratitude
the
men
sympathized
with
billy
and
their
feet
sounded
resentfully
upon
the
stones
billy
alone
marched
with
elaborate
lightness
quite
as
though
he
were
walking
on
air
and
loved
the
very
thought
of
the
guardhouse
headquarters
was
an
old
corner
house
that
had
flung
open
its
doors
to
general
jackson
with
an
almost
tremulous
eagerness
a
flag
waved
before
the
door
and
there
was
a
knot
beneath
of
couriers
and
orderlies
with
staff
officers
coming
and
going
opposite
was
a
store
closed
of
course
upon
sunday
but
boasting
a
deep
porch
with
benches
to
say
nothing
of
convenient
kegs
and
boxes
here
the
village
youth
and
age
alike
found
business
to
detain
them
the
exchanged
remarks
sleep
no
i
could
sleep
might
as
well
see
what
to
be
seen
i
ai
got
long
to
see
anything
and
so
i
told
susan

i
was

blue
coat
and
a
cocked
hat
and

having
his
customary
morning
with
his
heads
of
departments
an
invariably
recurring
period
in
his
quiet
and
ordered
existence
it
was
omitted
only
when
he
fought
in
the
morning
he
sat
as
usual

among

ring
around

an
owl
hooted
or
a
bat
flitted
they
had
been
telling
stories
of
and
they
swore

saw
general

the

invaluable
they
and
the
better

trust
sir
that
i
acted
rightly
you
acted
rightly
you
saw
nothing
of
general
shields
nothing
sir
it
is
true
that
the
woods
for
miles
are
extremely
thick
it
would
perhaps
be
possible
for
a
small
force
to
move
unseen
but
we
made
out
nothing
jackson
rose
and
drew
closer
the
sabre
and
the
bible
that
is
all
gentlemen
after
religious
services
you
will
return
to
your
respective
duties
the
sun
was
now
above
the
mountain
tops
the
mist
beginning
to
lift
it
lay
heavily
however
over
the
deep
woods
and
the
bottom
lands
of
the
south
fork
through
which
ran
the
luray
road
and
on
the
south
fork
clatter
clatter
shots
and
cries
shouting
the
alarm
as
they
came
splashing
through
the
ford
stopping
on
the
hither
bank
for
one
scattering
volley
back
into
the
woolly
veil
came
confederate
infantry
pickets
and
vedettes
yankee
cavalry
look
out
look
out
yankees
in
the
mist
the
foremost
man
ran
against
the
detail
from
the
coffin
seized
him
where
where
the
other
gasped
coming
drove
us
in
whole
lot
of
them
got
two
guns
all
of
shields
i
reckon
right
behind
he
broke
away
tearing
with
his
fellows
into
the
village
sergeant
coffin
and
his
men
stared
into
the
mist
they
heard
a
great
splashing
a
jingling
and
shouting
and
in
another
instant
were
aware
of
something
looming
like
a
herd
of
elephants
from
the
village
behind
them
burst
the
braying
of
their
own
bugles
headquarters
summoning
baggage
train
on
the
staunton
road
summoning
the
sound
was
shrill
insistent
the
shapes
in
the
mist
grew
larger
there
came
a
flash
of
rifles
pale
yellow
through
the
drift
as
of
lawn
zzzzzz
zzzzzz
sang
the
balls
the
twenty
men
of
the
proceeded
to
save
themselves
some
of
them
tore
down
a
side
street
straight
before
the
looming
onrush
others
leaped
fences
and
brushed
through
gardens
rich
and
dank
others
found
house
doors
suddenly
and
quietly
opening
before
them
houses
with
capacious
dark
garrets
and
cellars
all
the
dim
horde
more
and
more
of
it
came
splashing
through
the
ford
a
brazen
rumbling
arose
announcing
guns
the
foremost
of
the
horde
blurred
of
outline
preternaturally
large
huzzaing
and
firing
charged
into
the
streets
of
port
republic
in
a
twinkling
the
village
passed
from
her
sunday
atmosphere
to
one
of
a
highly
monday
the
blue
cavalry
began
to
harry
the
place
the
townspeople
hurried
home
trumpets
blared
shots
rang
out
oaths
shouts
of
warning
men
in
grey
belonging
with
the
wagon
train
ran
headlong
toward
their
posts
others
made
for
headquarters
where
the
flag
was
and
stonewall
jackson
a
number
headed
off
were
captured
at
once
others
indoors
when
the
alarm
arose
were
hidden
by
the
women
three
staff
officers
had
walked
after
leaving
jackson
council
toward
a
house
holding
pretty
daughters
whom
they
meant
to
take
to
church
when
the
clangour
broke
out
they
had
their
first
stupefied
moment
after
which
they
turned
and
ran
with
all
their
might
toward
headquarters
there
was
fighting
up
and
down
the
street
half
a
dozen
huzzaing
and
sabring
troopers
saw
the
three
and
shouted
to
others
nearer
yet
officers
cut
them
off
you
there
the
three
were
taken
a
captain
astride
of
a
great
reeking
horse
towered
above
them
staff
you
staff
is
jackson
in
the
town
and
where
quick
now
eh
what
that
a
lovely
horse
looks
exactly
i
imagine
like
rozinante
on
the
whole
i
should
say
that
mcclellan
might
be
finding
richmond
like
those
mirages
travellers
tell
about
the
nearer
he
gets
to
it
the
further
it
is
away
it
has
occurred
to
me
that
if
after
the
evacuation
of
corinth
beauregard
should
come
back
to
virginia
the
captain
in
blue
hot
and
breathless
bewildered
by
the
very
success
of
the
dash
into
town
kept
saying
where
is
jackson
what
quick
there
you
where
behind
him
a
corporal
spoke
out
cavalierly
they
are
going
to
tell
you
sir
there
a
large
house
down
there
got
something
like
a
flag
before
it
i
think
too
that
we
ought
to
go
take
the
bridge
the
streams
of
blue
troopers
flowed
toward
the
principal
street
and
united
there
some
one
saw
the
flag
more
plainly
that
a
headquarters
what
if
jackson
were
there
good
lord
what
if
we
took
jackson
a
bugler
blew
a
vehement
rally
of
you
come
on
all
of
you
come
on
the
stream
increased
in
volume
began
to
move
a
compact
body
down
the
street
there
are
horses
before
that
door
look
at
that
nag
that
jackson
horse
yes
saw
it
at
kernstown
forward
stonewall
jackson
came
out
of
the
house
with
the
flag
before
it
behind
him
were
those
of
his
staff
who
had
not
left
headquarters
when
the
invasion
occurred
while
holding
the
horses
before
the
door
waited
a
knot
of
most
anxious
orderlies
one
brought
little
sorrel
jackson
mounted
with
his
usual
slow
deliberation
then
turning
in
the
saddle
looked
back
to
the
shouting
blue
horsemen
they
saw
him
and
dug
spurs
into
flanks
first
he
pulled
the
forage
cap
over
his
eyes
and
then
he
jerked
his
hand
into
the
air
these
gestures
executed
he
touched
little
sorrel
with
the
rowel
and
his
suite
behind
him
started
off
down
the
street
toward
the
bridge
over
the
shenandoah
one
would
not
have
said
that
he
went
like
a
swift
arrow
there
was
indeed
an
effect
of
slowness
of
a
man
traversing
in
deep
thought
a
solitary
plain
but
for
all
that
he
went
so
fast
that
the
space
between
him
and
the
enemy
did
not
decrease
they
came
thunderingly
on
a
whole
federal
charge
but
he
kept
ahead
seeing
that
he
did
so
they
began
to
discharge
carbine
and
pistol
some
aiming
at
little
sorrel
some
at
the
grey
figure
riding
stiffly
bolt
upright
and
elbows
out
little
sorrel
shook
his
head
snorted
and
went
on
ahead
loomed
the
bridge
a
dusky
warm
tunnel
below
an
arch
of
wood
under
it
rolled
with
a
heavy
sound
the
shenandoah
across
the
river
upon
the
green
hilltops
had
arisen
a
commotion
all
the
drums
were
beating
the
long
roll
stonewall
jackson
and
little
sorrel
came
on
the
trodden
rise
of
earth
leading
to
the
bridge
mouth
the
blue
cavalry
shouted
and
spurred
their
carbines
cracked
the
balls
pockmarked
the
wooden
arch
jackson
dragged
the
forage
cap
lower
and
disappeared
within
the
bridge
the
four
or
five
with
him
turned
and
drew
across
the
gaping
mouth
the
blue
cavalry
came
on
firing
as
they
came
staff
and
orderlies
the
grey
answered
with
pistols
behind
in
the
bridge
sounded
the
hollow
thunder
of
little
sorrel
hoofs
the
sound
grew
fainter
horse
and
rider
were
nearly
across
staff
and
orderlies
fired
once
again
then
just
as
the
blue
were
upon
them
turned
dug
spur
shouted
and
disappeared
beneath
the
arch
the
federal
cavalry
massed
before
the
bridge
and
in
the
field
to
either
side
swore
and
swore
he
out
jackson
out
there
he
goes
up
the
road
fire
damn
it
all
what
the
use
he
charmed
we
almost
got
him
good
lord
we
all
have
been
a
patrol
galloped
up
they
got
a
great
wagon
train
sir
at
the
other
end
of
the
village
ordnance
reserve
supply
everything
it
is
in
motion
it
trying
to
get
off
by
the
staunton
road
the
cavalry
divided
a
strong
body
stayed
by
the
bridge
while
one
as
large
turned
and
galloped
away
those
staying
chafed
with
impatience
why
do
the
infantry
come
up
damned
creeping
snails
yes
we
could
cross
but
when
we
got
to
the
other
side
what
then
no
dare
to
burn
the
bridge
do
know
what
the
general
would
say
listen
to
those
drums
over
there
if
stonewall
jackson
brings
all
those
hornets
down
on
us
if
we
had
a
gun
speak
of
the
angels
unlimber
right
here
lieutenant
got
plenty
of
canister
now
if
the
damned
infantry
would
only
come
on
thought
it
was
just
behind
us
when
we
crossed
the
ford
what
that
off
there
that
was
a
sharp
sputter
of
musketry
firing
who
are
they
firing
at
there
are
any
rebels
we
took
them
all
prisoners
there
fighting
anyway
wagon
escort
maybe
the
devil
look
across
the
river
look
all
the
hornets
are
coming
down
of
the
detail
from
the
coffin
and
two
others
stood
their
ground
until
the
foremost
of
the
herd
was
crossing
the
ford
near
at
hand
large
threatening
trumpeting
then
the
three
ran
like
hares
hearts
pounding
at
their
sides
the
ocean
roaring
in
their
ears
and
in
every
cell
in
their
bodies
an
accurate
impression
that
they
had
been
seen
and
that
the
trumpeting
herd
meant
to
run
down
kill
or
capture
every
grey
soldier
in
port
republic
underfoot
was
wet
knot
grass
difficult
and
slippery
around
was
the
shrouding
mist
they
thought
the
lane
ran
through
to
another
street
but
it
proved
a
something
rose
mistily
before
them
it
turned
out
to
be
a
cowshed
they
flung
themselves
against
the
door
but
the
door
was
padlocked
behind
the
shed
between
it
and
a
stout
board
fence
sprang
a
great
clump
of
wet
elder
tall
and
rank
with
spreading
leaves
underneath
black
miry
earth
into
this
they
crowded
squatted
on
the
earth
turned
face
toward
the
passage
up
which
they
had
come
and
brought
their
rifles
to
the
front
a
hundred
yards
away
the
main
herd
went
by
gigantic
in
the
mist
the
three
in
the
elder
breathed
deep
all
gone
gone
no
there
a
squad
coming
up
here
the
three
kneeling
in
the
mire
watching
through
triangular
spaces
between
the
branchy
leaves
grew
suddenly
amazingly
calm
what
was
the
sense
in
being
frightened
you
could
get
away
was
there
anywhere
to
go
to
one
might
feel
agitation
enough
but
there
was
coffin
handled
his
rifle
with
the
deliberation
of
a
woman
smoothing
her
long
hair
the
man
next
him
jim
watts
even
while
he
settled
forward
on
his
knees
and
raised
his
musket
turned
his
head
aside
and
spat
derned
old
fog
always
gits
in
my
throat
a
branch
of
elder
was
cutting
billy
line
of
vision
he
broke
it
off
with
noiseless
care
and
raised
to
his
shoulder
the
enfield
rifle
which
he
had
acquired
at
winchester
there
loomed
at
thirty
feet
away
colossal
beasts
bestridden
by
giants
suddenly
the
mist
thinned
lifted
the
demon
steeds
and
riders
resolved
themselves
into
six
formidable
looking
federal
troopers
from
the
main
street
rang
the
federal
bugles
vehemently
rallying
imperative
shouting
too
broke
out
savage
triumphant
pointed
with
pistol
shots
the
bugle
called
again
to
the
colours
rally
i
calculate
said
one
of
the
six
blue
horsemen
that
the
boys
have
found
stonewall
then
they
need
us
all
swore
the
trooper
leading
if
anybody
in
the
they
can
wait
about
face
forward
trot
the
men
within
the
elder
settled
down
on
the
wet
black
earth
might
as
well
stay
here
i
suppose
said
coffin
jim
watts
began
to
shiver
it
awful
damp
and
cold
i
got
an
awful
pain
in
the
pit
of
my
stomach
he
rolled
over
and
lay
groaning
ca
i
go
sir
asked
billy
i
kind
of
feel
more
natural
in
the
open
now
mathew
coffin
had
just
been
thinking
that
while
this
elder
bush
springing
from
muddy
earth
with
a
manure
heap
near
was
damned
uncomfortable
it
was
better
than
being
outside
while
those
devils
were
slashing
and
shooting
perhaps
they
would
ride
away
or
the
army
might
come
over
the
bridge
and
there
would
be
final
salvation
he
had
even
added
a
line
to
the
letter
he
was
writing
an
elder
bush
afforded
me
some
slight
cover
from
which
to
fire
and
now
billy
maydew
wanted
to
go
outside
and
be
taken
prisoner
immediately
he
became
angry
again
you
no
fonder
of
the
open
than
i
am
he
said
and
his
upper
lip
twitched
one
side
away
from
his
white
teeth
billy
his
legs
already
out
of
the
bush
looked
at
him
with
large
calm
grey
eyes
kin
i
go
go
where
you
get
killed
you
would
grieve
if
i
did
would
you
i
kinder
thought
i
might
get
by
a
back
street
to
the
wagons
a
cousin
of
mine
a
wagon
master
and
he
ai
going
ter
give
up
easy
i
kinder
thought
i
might
help
i
just
waiting
said
coffin
until
jim
here
gets
over
his
spasm
then
i
give
the
word
jim
groaned
i
feel
a
yaller
dog
after
a
fight
you
know
i
did
mind
at
all
when
they
were
really
here
you
two
go
on
i
come
after
awhile
coffin
and
billy
found
the
back
street
it
lay
clear
warm
sunny
empty
they
all
down
at
the
bridge
said
billy
bang
bang
bang
they
came
to
a
house
blinds
all
closed
shrinking
behind
its
trees
houses
like
everything
else
had
personality
in
this
war
a
town
occupied
changed
its
mien
according
to
the
colour
of
the
uniform
in
possession
as
the
two
hurrying
grey
figures
approached
a
woman
starting
from
the
window
beside
which
she
had
been
kneeling
watching
through
a
crevice
ran
out
of
the
house
and
through
the
yard
to
the
gate
you
two
men
come
right
in
here
do
you
know
the
yankees
are
in
town
she
was
young
and
pretty
coffin
swept
off
his
cap
that
the
reason
we
trying
to
get
to
the
edge
of
town
to
help
the
men
with
the
wagon
train
her
eyes
grew
luminous
how
brave
you
are
go
and
god
bless
you
the
two
ran
on
mathew
coffin
added
another
line
to
his
letter
a
lady
besought
me
to
enter
her
house
saying
that
i
would
surely
be
killed
and
that
she
could
conceal
me
until
the
enemy
was
gone
but
i
they
were
nearly
out
of
town
they
could
see
the
long
train
hurriedly
moving
on
the
staunton
road
there
was
a
sudden
burst
of
musketry
a
voice
reached
them
from
the
street
below
halt
you
two
confeds
running
there
come
on
over
here
rally
to
the
colours
there
was
a
flash
of
the
stars
and
bars
waved
vigorously
oh
ha
ha
cried
billy
thar
was
some
of
us
was
taken
are
you
glad
we
did
stay
behind
the
cowshed
it
came
into
coffin
head
that
billy
might
tell
that
his
sergeant
had
wished
to
stay
behind
the
cowshed
the
blood
rushed
to
his
face
he
saw
the
difficulty
of
impressing
men
who
knew
about
the
cowshed
with
his
abilities
in
the
way
of
storming
batteries
he
had
really
a
very
considerable
share
of
physical
courage
and
naturally
he
esteemed
it
something
larger
than
it
was
he
began
to
burn
with
the
injustice
of
billy
maydew
thinking
him
backward
in
daring
and
so
reporting
him
around
as
he
ran
he
grew
angrier
and
angrier
and
not
far
from
the
shaken
flag
in
a
little
grassy
hollow
which
hid
them
from
view
he
called
upon
the
other
to
halt
billy
sense
of
discipline
brought
him
to
a
stop
but
did
not
keep
him
from
saying
what
for
they
were
only
two
soldiers
out
of
the
presence
of
others
and
in
a
pretty
tight
place
together
mathew
coffin
but
three
years
older
than
he
and
no
great
shakes
anyhow
what
for
asked
billy
i
just
want
to
say
to
you
said
coffin
thickly
that
as
to
that
shed
it
was
my
duty
to
protect
my
men
just
as
it
is
my
duty
as
an
officer
to
report
you
for
disobedience
and
bad
language
addressed
to
an
officer
billy
brow
clouded
i
had
forgotten
all
about
that
i
was
going
along
very
nicely
with
you
you
were
really
behaving
yourself
like
a
like
a
gentleman
the
was
all
right
you
are
brave
enough
when
it
comes
to
fighting
and
now
you
bringing
it
all
up
again
who
are
you
to
judge
of
a
gentleman
billy
looked
at
him
calmly
i
air
one
of
i
air
from
stand
you
are
going
to
the
guardhouse
for
disobedience
and
bad
language
and
impertinence
it
would
be
right
hard
said
billy
if
i
had
to
leave
outside
with
my
musket
but
i
do
coffin
red
in
the
face
made
at
him
the
thunder
run
man
supple
as
a
moccasin
swerved
aside
air
you
finished
speaking
sergeant
fer
if
you
have
if
you
do
mind
i
think
i
run
along
i
air
only
fighting
yankees
this
mornin
an
aide
of
jackson
cut
off
from
headquarters
and
taking
shelter
in
the
upper
part
of
the
town
crept
presently
out
of
hiding
and
finding
the
invaders
eyes
turned
toward
the
bridge
proceeded
with
dispatch
and
quietness
to
gather
others
from
dark
havens
when
he
had
a
score
or
more
he
proceeded
to
bolder
operations
in
the
field
and
on
the
staunton
road
all
was
commotion
wagons
with
their
teams
moving
in
double
column
up
the
road
negro
teamsters
clamouring
with
ashen
looks
dose
damn
yanks
knowed
we
did
see
dat
ghos
fer
nothin
las
night
wagon
masters
shouted
guards
and
sentries
looked
townward
with
anxious
eyes
the
aide
got
a
flag
from
the
quartermaster
tent
found
moreover
a
very
few
artillery
reserves
and
an
old
cranky
howitzer
with
all
of
these
he
returned
to
the
head
of
the
main
street
and
about
the
moment
the
cavalry
at
the
bridge
divided
succeeded
in
getting
his
forces
admirably
placed
in
a
strong
defensive
position
coffin
and
billy
maydew
joined
just
as
an
outpost
brought
a
statement
that
about
two
hundred
yankee
cavalry
were
coming
up
the
street
the
two
guns
federal
parrott
confederate
howitzer
belching
smoke
made
in
twenty
minutes
the
head
of
the
street
all
murk
in
the
first
charge
coffin
received
a
sabre
cut
over
the
head
the
blood
blinded
him
at
first
and
when
he
had
wiped
it
away
and
tied
a
beautiful
new
handkerchief
from
a
broadway
shop
about
the
wound
he
found
it
still
affected
sight
and
hearing
he
understood
that
their
first
musketry
fire
had
driven
the
cavalry
back
indeed
he
saw
two
or
three
riderless
horses
galloping
away
he
understood
also
that
the
yankees
had
brought
up
a
gun
and
that
the
captain
was
answering
with
the
superannuated
howitzer
he
was
sure
too
that
he
himself
was
firing
his
musket
with
great
precision
load
fire
load
fire
one
two
one
two
but
his
head
he
was
equally
sure
was
growing
larger
it
was
now
larger
than
the
globe
pictured
on
the
first
page
of
the
geography
he
had
studied
at
school
it
was
the
globe
and
he
was
atlas
holding
it
load

now
the
head
was
everything
and
all
life
was
within
it
there
was
a
handsome
young
man
named
coffin
very
brave
but
misunderstood
by
all
save
one
he
was
brave
and
handsome
he
could
take

the

struck

to
see
it
go
down
instead
with
a
roar
it
sprang
triple
brass
height
on
height
to
the
skies
the
stars
fell
and
suddenly
in
the
darkness
an
ocean
appeared
and
went
over
him
he
lay
beneath
the
overturned
federal
gun
and
the
grey
rush
that
had
silenced
the
gunners
and
taken
the
piece
went
on
for
a
long
time
he
lay
in
a
night
without
a
star
then
day
began
to
break
it
broke
curiously
palely
light
for
an
instant
then
obscured
by
thick
clouds
then
faint
light
again
some
part
of
his
brain
began
to
think
his
head
was
not
now
the
world
the
world
was
lying
on
his
shoulder
and
arm
crushing
it
with
one
piece
of
his
brain
he
began
to
appeal
to
people

another
piece

came
down
from
the
heights
with
the
impetuosity
of
a
torrent
behind
them
poured
other
grey
troops
on
the
cliff
heads
poague
and
carpenter
came
into
position
and
began
with
grape
and
canister
the
blue
parrott
full
before
the
bridge

menacing
the
lane
within
answered
with
a
shriek
of
shells
the
and
jackson
left
the
road
plunged
down
the
ragged
slope
of
grass
and
vines
and
came
obliquely
toward
the
dark
tunnel
jackson
and
little
sorrel
had
slipped
into
their
battle
aspect
you
would
have
said
that
every
auburn
hair
of
the
general
head
and
beard
was
a
vital
thing
his
eyes
glowed
as
though
there
were
lamps
behind
and
his
voice
rose
like
a
trumpet
of
promise
and
doom
halt

at
the

the
rushed
in

through

volley
the
unwounded
among
the

artillerymen
strove
to
plant
a
shell
within
the
dusky
lane
but
most
of
the
gunners
were
down
or
the
fuse
was
wrong
the
grey
torrent
leaped
out
of
the
tunnel
and
upon
the
gun
they
took
it
and
turned
it
against
the
horsemen
the
blue
cavalry
fled
on
the
bluff
heads
above
the
river
three
grey
batteries
came
into
action
the
virginia
began
to
sweep
the
streets
of
port
republic
the
blue
cavalry
leaving
the
guns
leaving
prisoners
they
had
taken
and
their
wounded
turned
alike
from
the
upper
end
of
the
village
and
rode
for
the
south
fork
one
and
all
they
splashed
through
not

in
hot
sunshine
the

from

a
mile
or
two
in

deep
woods
they
met
shields
infantry
advance
there
followed
a
movement
toward
the
town
futile
enough
for
as
the
vanguard
approached
the
confederate
batteries
across
the
river
limbered
up
trotted
or
galloped
to
other
positions
on
the
green
bluff

and
trained
the
guns
on
the
ground
between
port
republic
and
the
head
of
the

and
took

halted
listening
to
the
guns
at
cross

sitting
little
sorrel
at
the
northern
end
of
the
bridge
stonewall
jackson
watched
taliaferro
men
break

to

on
his

the
cannon
of
cross
keys
and
with
a
glass
made
out
the
battle
smoke
for
an
hour
they
gazed
and
listened
anxious
and
eager
then
the
horsemen
remounted
the
ambulance
moved
from
the
boulder
and
all
went
slowly
down
the
long
loops
of
road
down
and
down
they
wound
from
the
cool
blowing
air
of

of
the
passenger
coach
and
four
officers
followed
as
its
guard
the
escort
was
slight
never
were
there
many
men
spared
for
these
duties
the
dead
would
have
been
the
first
to
speak
against
it
every
man
in
life
was
needed
at
the
front
the
dozen
troopers
stalled
their
horses
in
two
of
the
box
cars
and
themselves
took
possession
of
a
third
the
bell
rang
slowly
and
tollingly
the
train
moved
toward
charlottesville
and
the
little
crowd
of
country
folk
was
left
in
the
june
sunshine
with
the
empty
ambulance
in
the
gold
afternoon
the
bell
slowly
ringing
the
train
crept
into
charlottesville
in
this
town
convenient
for
hospitals
and
stores
midway
between
richmond
and
the
valley
a
halting
place
for
troops
moving
east
and
west
there
were
soldiers
enough
for
a
soldier
escort
to
his
resting
place
the
concourse
at
the
station
was
large
and
a
long
train
followed
the
bier
of
the
dead
general
out
through
the
town
to
the
university
of
virginia
and
the
graveyard
beyond
there
were
no
students
now
at
the
university
in
the
rotunda
surgeons
held
council
and
divided
supplies
in
the
ranges
where
were
the
students
rooms
and
in
the
professors
houses
lay
the
sick
and
wounded
from
room
to
room
between
the
pillars
moved
the
nursing
women
the
rotunda
was
cleared
surgeons
and
nurses
snatched
one
and
with
the
families
from
the
professors
houses
and
the
men
about
the
place
and
the
servants
gathered
upon
the
rotunda
steps
or
upon
the
surrounding
grassy
slopes
to
watch
the
return
of
an
old
student
it
was
not
long
before
they
heard
the
dead
march
for
an
hour
the
body
lay
between
the
white
columns
before
the
rotunda
that
jefferson
had
built
soldiers
and
civilians
women
and
children
passing
before
the
bier
looked
upon
the
marble
face
and
the
hand
that
clasped
the
sword
then
toward
sunset
the
coffin
lid
was
closed
the
bearers
took
the
coffin
up
the
dead
march
began
again
and
all
moved
toward
the
graveyard
dusk
gathered
soft
and
warm
and
filled
with
fireflies
the
greenwood
carriage
with
the
three
sisters
and
miss

slowly
through
the
scented
air
up

they
sat
at

in

scarcely
touching
supper
but
in
the
parlour
afterward
judith
turned
at
bay
even
aunt
lucy
of
all
people
in
the
world
aunt
lucy
if
you
do
not
smile
this
instant
i
hope
all
the
greenwood
shepherdesses
will
step
from
out
the
roses
and
disown
you
and
unity
if
you
do
play
sing
look
cheerful
my
heart
will
break
who
calls
it
loss
this
afternoon
he
left
a
thought
of
him
that
will
guide
men
on
who
doubts
that
morning
we
shall
hear
that
cross
keys
was
won
oh
i
know
that
you
are
thinking
most
of
general
ashby
but
i
am
thinking
most
of
cross
keys
judith
judith
you
are
the
strongest
of
us
all
judith
darling
nothing
going
to
hurt
richard
i
just
feel
it
hush
molly
judith
not
afraid
no
i
am
not
afraid
i
think
the
cannon
have
stopped
at
cross
keys
and
that
they
are
resting
on
the
now
for
us
women
i
do
not
think
that
we
do
badly
now
we
serve
all
day
and
half
the
night
and
we
keep
up
the
general
heart
i
think
that
if
in
any
old
romance
we
read
of
women
like
the
women
of
the
south
in
this
war
we
would
say
women
were
heroic
we
have
been
at
war
for
a
year
and
two
months
i
see
no
end
of
it
it
is
a
desert
and
no
one
knows
how
wide
it
is
we
may
travel
for
years
beside
every
marching
soldier
there
marches
invisible
a
woman
soldier
too
we
are
in
the
field
as
they
are
in
the
field
and
doing
our
part
no
we
have
not
done
at
all
badly
but
now
let
us
give
it
all
there
is
a
plane
where
every
fibre
is
heroic
let
us
draw
to
full
height
lift
eyes
and
travel
boldly
we
have
to
cross
the
desert
but
from
the
desert
one
sees
all
the
stars
let
us
be
too
wise
for
such
another
drooping
hour
she
came
and
kissed
her
aunt
and
clung
to
her
i
was
scolding
aunt
lucy
how
could
i
but
i
simply
have
to
be
strong
i
have
to
look
at
the
stars
for
the
desert
is
full
of
terrible
shapes
some
one
said
that
the
battle
with
shields
may
be
fought
i
have
to
look
at
the
stars
she
lifted
herself
we
finished
did
we
oh
yes
i
did
like
the
ending
well
let
us
begin
park
molly
have
you
seen
my
knitting
having
with
his
fellows
of
the
escort
from
port
republic
seen
the
earth
heaped
over
the
dead
cavalry
leader
maury
stafford
lay
that
night
in
charlottesville
at
an
old
friend
house
he

the
friend

up
and
down

the
night

the
morning

was
at
the
university
miss
cary
she

here
in
about
half
an
hour
if
you
wait
i
wait
said
stafford
he
sat
down
beneath
an
elm
and
with
his
eyes
upon
the
road
by
which
must
approach
the
greenwood
carriage
waited
the
it
passed
the
carriage
drew
up
and
judith
stepped
from
it
her
eyes
rested
upon
him
with
a
quiet
friendliness
he
had
been
her
suitor
but
he
was
so
no
longer
months
ago
he
had
his
answer
all
the
agitation
the
strong
controlling
interest
of
his
world
must
perforce
have
made
him
forget
she
touched
his
hand

did
not

seems
that

ewell
division

but
it
was
largely
an
artillery
battle
i
saw
a
copy
of
general
jackson
characteristic
telegram
to
richmond
gave
us
the
victory
at
cross
keys
fremont
has
drawn
off
to
harrisonburg
there
is
a
rumour
of
a
battle
with
shields
he
thought
that
afternoon
as
he
passed
through
the
road
gates
and
into
the
drive
between
the
oaks
that
he
had
never
seen
the
greenwood
place
look
so
fair
the
sun
was
low
and
there
were
shadows
but
where
the
light
rays
touched
all
lay
mellow
and
warm
golden
and
gay
and
sweet
on
the
porch
he
found
unity
sitting
with
her
guitar
singing
to
a
ragged
grey
youth
thin
and
pale
with
big
hollow
eyes
she
smiled
and
put
out
her
hand
judith
said
you
were
coming

in
a
moment
major
stafford
captain
howard
go
on
singing
very
well
soft
the
fountain
lingering
falls
the
southern

why
is
it
that
convalescent
soldiers
want
the
very
most
sentimental
ditties
that
can
be
sung
far
the
mountain
breaks
the
day
too
soon
i
know
that
string
is
going
to
snap
presently
then
where
would
i
buy
guitar
strings
in
a
land
without
a

judith
came
down
in
a
soft
old
muslin
pale
violet
open
at
the
throat
it
went
well
with
that
warm
column
with
the
clear
beauty
of
her
face
and
her
dark
liquid
eyes
she
had
a
scarf
in
her
hand
it
chanced
to
be
the
long
piece
of
black
lace
that
stafford
remembered
her
wearing
that
april
it
is
a
lovely
evening
suppose
we
walk
there
was
a
path
through
the
flower
garden
down
a
slope
of
grass
across
a
streamlet
in
a
meadow
then
gently
up
through
an
ancient
wood
and
more
steeply
to
the
top
of
a
green
hill
a
hill
of
hills
from
which
to
watch
the
sunset
stafford
unlatched
the
gate
the
roses
are
blooming
as
though
there
were
no
war
said
judith
look
at
george
the
fourth
and
the
seven
sisters
and
my
old
giant
of
battle
sometimes
you
are
like
one
flower
answered
stafford
and
sometimes
like
another
in
that
dress
you
are
like
heliotrope
judith
wondered
is
it
wise
to
go
on
if
he
has
forgotten
so
little
as
that
she
spoke
aloud
i
have
hardly
been
in
the
garden
for
days
suppose
we
rest
on
the
arbour
steps
and
talk
there
is
so
much
i
want
to
know
about
the
valley
stafford
looked
pleadingly
no
no
let
us
go
the
old
path
and
see
the
sunset
over
greenwood
always
when
i
ride
from
here
i
say
to
myself
may
never
see
this
place
again
they
walked
on
between
the
box
the
box
has
not
been
clipped
this
year
i
do
not
know
why
except
that
all
things
go
unpruned
the
garden
itself
may
go
back
to
wilderness
you
have
noticed
that
it
is
always
so
in
times
like
these
we
leave
the
artificial
things
have
a
hardier
growth
feeling
breaks
its
banks
custom
is
not
listened
to
it
is
not
so
bad
as
that
said
judith
smiling
and
we
will
not
really
let
the
box
grow
out
of
all
proportion
now
tell
me
of
the
valley
they
left
the
garden
and
dipped
into
the
green
meadow
stafford
talked
of
battles
and
marches
but
he
spoke
in
a
monotone
distrait
and
careless
as
of
a
scholar
reciting
his
lesson
such
as
it
was
the
recital
lasted
across
the
meadow
into
the
wood
yet
lit
by
yellow
light
a
place
itself
for
day
dreams
no
i
did
not
see
him
fall
he
was
leading
an
infantry
regiment
he
was
happy
in
his
death
i
think
one
whom
the
gods
wait
your
scarf
has
caught
he
loosed
it
from
the
branch
she
lifted
the
lace
put
it
over
her
head
and
held
it
with
her
slender
hand
beneath
her
chin
he
looked
at
her
and
his
breath
came
sharply
a
shaft
of
light
deeply
gold
struck
across
the
woodland
path
he
stood
within
it
on
slightly
rising
ground
that
lifted
him
above
her
the
quality
of
the
light
gave
him
a
singular
aspect
he
looked
a
visitant
from
another
world
a
worn
spirit
of
fine
temper
but
somewhat
haggard
somewhat
stained
lines
came
into
brow
she
stepped
more
quickly
and
they
passed
from
out
the
wood
to
a
bare
hillside
grass
and
field
flowers
to
the
summit
the
little
path
that
zigzagged
upward
was
not
wide
enough
for
two
he
moved
through
the
grass
and
flowers
beside
her
a
little
higher
still
and
between
her
and
the
sun
his
figure
was
dark
no
longer
lighted
as
it
was
in
the
wood
judith
sighed
inwardly
i
am
so
tired
that
i
am
fanciful
i
should
not
have
come
she
talked
on
when
we
were
children
and
read
progress
unity
and
i
named
this
the
hill
difficulty
and
we
named
the
blue
ridge
the
delectable
mountains
war
puts
a
stop
to
reading
yes
the
hill
difficulty
on
the
other
side
was
the
valley
of
humiliation
was
it
not
yes
where
christian
met
apollyon
we
are
nearly
up
and
the
sunset
will
be
beautiful
at
the
top
around
a
solitary
tree
had
been
built
a
bench
the
two
sat
down
the
sun
was
sinking
behind
the
blue
ridge
above
the
mountains
sailed
a
fleet
of
little
clouds
in
a
sea
of
pale
gold
shut
in
by
purple
headlands
here
and
there
on
the
earth
the
yellow
light
lingered
judith
sat
with
her
head
thrown
back
against
the
bark
of
the
tree
her
eyes
upon
the
long
purple
coast
and
the
golden
sea
stafford
his
sword
drawn
forward
rested
his
clasped
hands
upon
the
hilt
and
his
cheek
on
his
hands
are
they
not
like
the
delectable
mountains
she
said
almost
you
can
see
the
shepherds
and
the
flocks
hear
the
pilgrims
singing
look
where
that
shaft
of
light
is
striking
there
is
heliotrope
all
around
me
he
answered
i
see
nothing
know
nothing
but
that
you
do
very
wrongly
she
said
you
pain
me
and
you
anger
me
judith
judith
i
can
not
help
it
if
the
wildest
tempest
were
blowing
about
this
hilltop
a
leaf
upon
this
tree
might
strive
and
strive
to
cling
to
the
bough
to
remain
with
its
larger
self
yet
would
it
be
twisted
off
and
carried
whither
the
wind
willed
my
passion
is
that
tempest
and
my
soul
is
that
leaf
it
is
more
than
a
year
since
first
i
told
you
that
i
could
not
return
your
feeling
last
october
that
day
we
rode
to
the
old
mill
i
told
you
so
again
and
told
you
that
if
we
were
to
remain
friends
it
could
only
be
on
condition
that
you
accepted
the
truth
as
truth
and
let
the
storm
you
speak
of
die
you
promised
even
pale
friendship
judith
i
wanted
that
if
you
wish
it
still
all
talk
like
this
must
cease
after
october
i
thought
it
was
quite
over
all
through
the
winter
those
gay
wonderful
letters
that
you
wrote
kept
us
up
at
greenwood
i
could
hear
from
you
only
on
those
terms
i
kept
them
until
they
too
were
of
no
use
when
i
wrote
to
you
last
month
i
knew
of
your
happiness
before
you
wrote
i
learned
it
from
one
nearly
concerned
i
i
he
put
his
hand
to
his
throat
as
if
he
were
choking
arose
and
walked
a
few
paces
and
came
back
it
was
over
there
near
gordonsville
under
a
sunset
sky
much
like
this
what
did
i
do
that
night
i
have
a
memory
of
all
the
hours
of
blackness
that
men
have
ever
passed
lying
under
forest
trees
with
their
faces
against
the
earth
you
see
me
standing
here
but
i
tell
you
my
face
is
against
the
earth
at
your
feet
it
is
madness
said
judith
you
see
not
me
but
a
goddess
of
your
own
making
it
is
a
chain
of
the
imagination
break
it
true
goddesses
do
not
wish
such
love
at
least
true
women
do
not
i
can
not
break
it
it
is
too
strong
sometimes
i
wish
to
break
it
sometimes
not
judith
rose
let
us
go
the
sun
is
down
she
took
the
narrow
path
and
he
walked
beside
and
above
her
as
before
darker
crimson
had
come
into
the
west
but
the
earth
beneath
had
yet
a
glow
and
warmth
they
took
a
path
which
led
not
by
way
of
the
wood
but
by
the
old
greenwood
graveyard
the
of
the
carys
at
the
foot
of
the
lone
tree
hill
they
came
again
side
by
side
and
so
mounted
the
next
low
rise
of
ground
forgive
me
said
stafford
i
have
angered
you
i
am
very
wretched
forgive
me
they
were
beside
the
low
graveyard
wall
she
turned
leaning
against
it
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
you
all
come
and
you
go
away
and
the
next
day
brings
news
that
such
and
such
an
one
is
dead
with
the
sound
of
death
wings
always
in
the
air
how
can
any
one
i
do
not
wish
to
be
angry
if
you
choose
we
will
talk
like
friends
like
a
man
and
a
woman
of
the
south
if
you
do
not
i
can
but
shut
my
ears
and
hasten
home
and
henceforth
be
too
wise
to
give
you
opportunity
i
go
back
to
the
front
be
patient
with
me
these
few
minutes
and
i
judith
i
will
cling
with
all
my
might
to
the
tree

touch
like
sunlight

upon
him
of
his
old
fine
grace
charming

and
strong
i
wo
let
go
how
lovely
it
is
and
still
the
elm

and
beyond
that
gold
sky
and
the
mountains
all
the
fighting
let
us
go
through
the
graveyard
it
is
so
still
and
all
their
troubles
are
over
within
the
graveyard
too
was
an
old
bench
around
an
elm
a
few
minutes
only
pleaded
stafford
presently
i
must
ride
back
to
town
and
in
the
morning
i
return
to
the
valley
they
sat
down
before
them
was
a
flat
tombstone
sunk
in
ivy
a
white
rose
at
the
head
stafford
leaning
forward
drew
aside
with
the
point
of
his
scabbard
the
dark
sprays
that
mantled
the
graved
coat
of
arms
ludwell
cary

have
seen
many
die
this
year
who
wished
to
live
if
death
were
forgetfulness
i
do
not
believe
it
i
shall
persist
and
still
feel
the
blowing
wind
listen
to
the
said
judith
there
shows
the
evening

can
a
woman
know
what
love
is
this
envelope
of
the
soul

thereby
i
might
gain
you
your
presence
always
with
me
in
waves
of
light
and
sound
and
you
can
not
truly
see
nor
hear
me

you
do

said
clearly
that

pass
major
stafford
she
was
gone
over
the
dark
trailing
periwinkle
through
the
little
gate
canopied
with
honeysuckle
for
a
minute
he
stayed
beneath
the
elms
calling
himself
fool
and
treble
fool
then
he
followed
though
at
a
little
distance
she
went
before
him
in
her
pale
violet
through
the
gathering
dusk
unlatched
for
herself
the
garden
gate
and
passed
into
the
shadow
of
the
box
a
few
moments
later
he
too
entered
the
scented
alley
and
saw
her
waiting
for
him
at
the
gate
that
gave
upon
the
lawn
he
joined
her
and
they
moved
without
speaking
to
the
house
they
found
the
family
gathered
on
the
porch
an
old
horse
waiting
on
the
gravel
below
and
an
elderly
plain
man

neighbouring

halfway
up

chilling

came
on
night

and
a
drifting
mist
hid
the
army
of

the
next
morning
fremont
withdrew
down
the

toward

the

buried
the
dead
of

in

and
then
it
too
vanished
to
the
last
wagon
wheel
to
the
last
poor
straggler
all
was
gone
it
was
an
idiosyncrasy
of
jackson
to
gather
and
take
with
him
every
filing
he
travelled
like
a
magnet
all
that
belonged
to
him
went
with
him
long
after
dark
high
on
the
an
aide
appeared
in
the
rain
facing
the
head
of
the
rear
brigade
the
general
says
have
you
brought
off
every
inch
of
the
captured
guns
tell
him
all
but
one
unserviceable
caisson
we
did
not
have
horses
for
that
the
aide
galloped
forward
reported
turned
and
galloped
back
general
jackson
says
sir
that
if
it
takes
every
horse
in
your
command
that
caisson
is
to
be
brought
up
before
daylight
the

something
told
me
i
better
do
it
in
the
first
place
brigade
after
brigade
the
army
of
the
valley
climbed
the
blue
ridge
at
first
the
rain
had
been
welcome
so
weary
and
heated
were
the
men
but
it
never
took
long
for
the
novelty
of
rain
to
wear
off
wet
and
silent
the
troops
climbed
through
the
darkness
they
had
won
a
victory
they
were
going
to
win
others
old
jack
was
as
great
a
general
as
napoleon
and
two
or
three
hours
ago
it
had
seemed
possible
to
his
soldiers
that
history
might
rank
them
with
the
old
guard
but
the
rain
was
chill
and
the
night
mournfully
dark
when
had
they
eaten
they
hardly
remembered
and
it
was
an
effort
to
lift
one
leg
after
the
other
numbers
of
men
were
dropping
with
sleep
all
shivered
all
felt
the
reaction
back
on
the
plain
by
the
river
lay
in
trenches
some
hundreds
of
their
comrades
in
the
rear
toiled
upwards
ambulances
filled
with
wounded
there
were
not
ambulances
enough
the
wounded
rode
wherever
there
was
room
in
any
wagon
the
less
badly
hurt
sat
or
lay
dully
suffering
on
caissons
all
as
they
toiled
upward
had
visions
of
the
field
behind
them
it
had
not
been
a
great
battlefield
as
to
extent
and
numbers
engaged
but
a
horrible
one
the
height
where
the
six
guns
had
been
the
gun
which
the
louisianians
took
the
old
charcoal
kiln
where
the
guns
had
been
planted
the
ground
around
the
side
of
the
ravine
these
made
an
ugly
sight
between
eyelid
and
ball
so
many
dead
horses
eighty
of
them
in
one
place
one
standing
upright
where
he
had
reared
and
dying
had
been
caught
and
propped
by
a
blasted
pine
so
many
dead
men
grey
and
blue
lying
as
in
pattern
and
then
the
plain
beneath
and
the
desperate
fight
and
the
battle
in
the
wheat
the
federal
cannon
had
sheared
the
heads
from
the
men
the
soldiers
mounting
through
the
darkness
in
the
whistling
wind
and
rain
saw
again
these
headless
bodies
one
only
the
body
of
a
young
soldier
of
the
virginia
a
brother
of
the
colonel
of
the
the
army
was
carrying
with
it
the
brother
wounded
himself
had
begged
the
body
at
the
first
village
where
the
army
halted
he
would
get
a
coffin
and
lay
the
boy
in
a
grave
he
could
mark
his
mother
and
sister
could
visit
it
then
permission
was
given
it
lay
now
in
an
ambulance
covered
with
a
flag
cleave
lay
upon
the
straw
beside
it
his
arm
flung
across
the
breast
at
its
feet
sat
a
dark
and
mournful
figure
old
tullius
with
his
chin
propped
on
his
knees
the
rain
came
down
fine
as
needles
points
and
cold
somewhere
far
below
a
mountain
stream
was
rushing
and
in
the
darkness
the
wind
was
sighing
the
road
wound
higher
the
lead
horses
drawing
a
gun
stepped
too
near
the
edge
of
the
road
the
wet
earth
gave
way
the
unfortunate
brutes
plunged
struggled
went
down
and
over
the
embankment
dragging
the
wheel
horses
after
them
gun
carriage
and
caisson
followed
the
echoes
awoke
dismally
the
infantry
climbing
above
looked
down
the
far
wooded
slopes
but
incuriously
the
infantry
was
tired
cold
and
famished
it
was
not
interested
in
artillery
accidents
perhaps
at
times
the
old
guard
had
felt
thus
with
a
sick
and
cold
depression
kibed
spirits
as
well
as
heels
empty
of
enthusiasm
as
of
food
resolution
lost
somewhere
in
the
darkness
sonority
gone
even
from
and
slowly
amid
drizzling
rain
brigade
after
brigade
made
brown
gap
and
bivouacked
within
the
dripping
forest
morning
brought
a
change
the
rain
yet
fell
but
the
army
was
recovering
from
the
battlefield
it
took
not
long
nowadays
to
recover
the
army
was
learning
to
let
the
past
drop
into
the
abyss
and
not
to
listen
for
the
echoes
it
seemed
a
long
time
that
the
country
had
been
at
war
and
each
day
events
drove
across
and
hid
the
event
of
the
day
before
speculation
as
to
the
morrow
remained
but
even
this
hung
loosely
upon
the
army
of
the
valley
wonderment
as
to
the
next
move
partook
less
of
deep
anxiety
than
of
the
tantalization
of
guessing
at
a
riddle
with
the
answer
always
just
eluding
you
the
army
guessed
and
guessed
bothering
with
the
riddle
made
its
chief
occupation
while
it
rested
for
two
days
and
nights
beside
smoky
in
a
cold
june
rain
in
the
cramped
area
of
brown
gap
but
so
assured
was
it
that
old
jack
knew
the
proper
answer
and
would
give
it
in
his
own
good
time
that
the
guessing
had
little
fretfulness
or
edge
of
temper
by
now
officers
and
men
the
confidence
was
implicit
tell
general
jackson
that
we
will
go
wherever
he
wishes
us
to
go
and
do
whatever
he
wishes
us
to
do
on
the
morning
of
the
twelfth
at
early
dawn
the
army
found
itself
again
in
column
the
rain
had
ceased
the
clouds
were
gone
presently
up
rose
the
sun
the
army
turned
its
back
upon
the
sun
the
army
went
down
the
western
side
of
the
mountains
down
again
into
the
great
valley
the
men
who
had
guessed
richmond
were
crestfallen
they
who
had
stoutly
held
that
old
jack
had
mounted
to
this
eyrie
merely
the
better
again
to
swoop
down
upon
fremont
shields
or
banks
crowed
triumphantly
knew
it
tuesday
when
the
ambulances
obliqued
at
the
top
and
went
on
down
toward
staunton
he
sends
his
wounded
in
front
he
never
leaves
them
behind
knew
it
was
richmond
brigade
by
brigade
the
army
wound
down
the
mountain
passed
below
port
republic
and
came
into
a
lovely
verdurous
country
soft
green
grass
and
stately
trees
set
well
apart
here
it
rested
five
days
and
here
the
commanding
general
received
letters
from
lee
recent
successes
have
been
the
cause
of
the
liveliest
joy
in
this
army
as
well
as
in
the
country
the
admiration
excited
by
your
skill
and
boldness
has
been
constantly
mingled
with
solicitude
for
your
situation
the
practicability
of
reinforcing
you
has
been
the
subject
of
the
gravest
consideration
it
has
been
determined
to
do
so
at
the
expense
of
weakening
this
army
lawton
with
six
regiments
from
georgia
is
on
his
way
to
you
and
whiting
with
eight
veteran
regiments
leaves
here
the
object
is
to
enable
you
to
crush
the
forces
opposed
to
you
leave
your
enfeebled
troops
to
watch
the
country
and
guard
the
passes
covered
by
your
artillery
and
cavalry
and
with
your
main
body
including
ewell
division
and
lawton
and
commands
move
rapidly
to
ashland
by
rail
or
otherwise
as
you
find
most
advantageous
and
sweep
down
between
the
chickahominy
and
the
pamunkey
cutting
up
the
enemy
communications
while
this
army
attacks
mcclellan
in
front
he
will
then
i
think
be
forced
to
come
out
of
his
entrenchments
where
he
is
strongly
posted
on
the
chickahominy
and
apparently
preparing
to
move
by
gradual
approaches
on
and
of
a
slightly
earlier
date
there
be
nothing
requiring
your
attention
in
the
valley
so
as
to
prevent
your
leaving
it
in
a
few
days
and
you
can
make
arrangements
to
deceive
the
enemy
and
impress
him
with
the
idea
of
your
presence
please
let
me
know
that
you
may
unite
at
the
decisive
moment
with
the
army
near
it
may
be
safely
assumed
that
these
directions
could
have
been
given
to
no
man
more
scrupulously
truthful
in
the
least
of
his
personal
relations
and
to
no
commander
in
war
more
gifted
in
all
that
pertains
to
deceiving
the
enemy
and
impressing
him
with
an
idea
of
your
presence
infantry
and
artillery
the
army
of
the
valley
rested
at
mt
meridian
under
noble
trees
the
cavalry
moved
to
harrisonburg
munford
had
succeeded
ashby
in
command
and
munford
came
to
take
his
orders
from
his
general
he
found
him
with
the
dictionary
the
bible
the
maxims
and
a
lemon
you
will
draw
a
cordon
quite
across
north
of
harrisonburg
see
from
here
to
here
he
drew
a
map
toward
him
and
touched
two
points
with
a
strong
brown
finger
very
well
sir
you
will
arrest
all
travellers
up
and
down
the
valley
none
is
to
pass
going
north
or
going
south
very
well
sir
i
wish
the
cavalry
outposts
to
have
no
communication
with
the
infantry
if
they
know
nothing
of
the
latter
movements
they
can
not
accidentally
transmit
information
you
will
give
this
order
and
you
will
be
held
accountable
for
its
very
well
sir
you
will
proceed
to
act
with
boldness
masking
caution
press
the
outposts
of
the
enemy
and
if
possible
drive
him
still
further
northward
he
broke
off
and
sucked
the
lemon
very
well
sir
create
in
him
the
impression
that
you
are
strongly
supported
drive
it
into
his
mind
that
i
am
about
to
advance
against
him
general
lee
is
sending
reinforcements
from
richmond
i
do
not
object
to
his
knowing
this
nor
to
his
having
an
exaggerated
idea
of
their
number
you
will
regard
these
instructions
as
important
i
will
do
my
best
sir
good
good
that
is
all
colonel
munford
returned
to
harrisonburg
drew
his
cordon
across
the
valley
and
pushed
his
outposts
twelve
miles
to
the
northward
here
they
encountered
a
federal
flag
of
truce
an
officer
with
several
surgeons
and
a
demand
from
fremont
for
the
release
of
his
wounded
men
the
outposts
passed
the
embassy
on
to
munford
headquarters
at
harrisonburg
that
cavalryman
stated
that
he
would
take
pleasure
in
forwarding
general
demand
to
general
jackson
far
oh
no
it
is
not
far
in
the
mean
time
it
was
hoped
that
the
federal
officers
would
find
such
and
such
a
room
comfortable
lodging
they
found
it
so
discovered
too
that
it
was
next
to
munford
own
quarters
and
that
the
wall
between
was
thin
nothing
more
indeed
than
a
slight
partition
an
hour
or
two
later
the
federal
officers
sitting
quietly
heard
the
confederate
cavalryman
enter
ask
for
writing
materials
demand
of
an
aide
if
the
courier
had
yet
returned
from
general
jackson
place
himself
at
a
table
and
fall
to
writing
one
of
the
blue
soldiers
tiptoed
to
the
wall
found
a
chair
conveniently
placed
and
sat
down
with
his
ear
to
the
boards
for
five
minutes
scratch
scratch
went
munford
pen
at
the
expiration
of
this
time
there
was
heard
in
the
hall
without
a
jingling
of
spurs
and
a
clanking
of
a
sabre
the
scratching
ceased
the
pen
was
evidently
suspended
come
in
the
listeners
in
the
next
room
heard
more
jingling
a
heavy
entrance
munford
voice
again
very
good
gilmer
what
did
the
general
say
he
says
sir
that
general
fremont
is
to
be
told
that
our
surgeons
will
continue
to
attend
their
wounded
as
we
are
not
monsters
they
will
be
as
carefully
attended
to
as
are
our
own
the
only
lack
in
the
matter
will
be
medicines
and
anaesthetics
very
good
gilmer
i
will
so
report
to
the
officer
in
charge
of
the
flag
of
well
what
is
it
man
you
look
as
though
you
were
bursting
with
news
i
am
sir
whiting
and
hood
and
lawton
and
the
lord
knows
who
besides
are
coming
over
the
rockfish
gap
i
saw
them
with
my
own
eyes
on
the
staunton
road
about
fifteen
thousand
i
reckon
of
lee
best
gorgeous
batteries
gorgeous
troops
hood
texans
thousands
of
georgians
all
of
them
playing
and
hurrahing
and
asking
everybody
they
see
to
point
out
jackson
no
sir
i
not
dreaming
i
know
we
thought
that
they
could
get
here
for
several
days
yet
but
here
they
are
good
lord
i
would
for
a
pretty
miss
the
hunting
down
the
valley
the
blue
soldiers
heard
munford
and
the
courier
go
out
an
hour
later
they
were
conducted
to
the
colonel
presence
i
am
sorry
major
but
general
jackson
declines
acceding
to
general
fremont
request
he
says
the
party
with
the
flag
of
truce
went
back
to
fremont
they
went
like
lieutenant
gilmer
bursting
with
news
the
next
day
munford
pushed
his
advance
to
new
market
fremont
promptly
broke
up
his
camp
retired
to
strasburg
and
began
to
throw
up
fortifications
his
spies
brought
bewilderingly
conflicting
reports
a
deserter
who
a
little
later
deserted
back
again
confided
to
him
that
stonewall
jackson
was
simply
another
cromwell
that
he
was
making
his
soldiers
into
ironsides
that
they
were
presbyterian
to
a
man
and
believed
that
god
almighty
had
planned
this
campaign
and
sent
jackson
to
execute
it
that
he
the
deserter
being
of
cavalier
descent
could
stand
it
and
got
out
there
was
an
affair
of
outposts
in
which
several
prisoners
were
taken
these
acknowledged
that
a
very
large
force
of
cavalry
occupied
harrisonburg
and
that
jackson
was
close
behind
having
rebuilt
the
bridge
at
fort
republic
across
the
shenandoah
and
advanced
by
the
keezletown
road
an
old

the
condition
of
affairs
here
imperatively
requires
that
some
position
be
immediately
made
strong
enough
to
be
maintained
reinforcements
should
be
sent
here
without
an
hour
delay
whether
from
richmond
or
elsewhere
forces
of
the
enemy
are
certainly
coming
into
this
region
casualties
have
reduced
my
force
the
small
corps
scattered
about
the
country
are
exposed
to
sudden
attack
by
greatly
superior
force
of
an
enemy
to
whom
intimate
knowledge
of
country
and
universal
friendship
of
inhabitants
give
the
advantage
of
rapidity
and
secrecy
of
movements
i
respectfully
submit
this
representation
to
the
president
taking
it
for
granted
that
it
is
the
duty
of
his
generals
to
offer
for
his
consideration
such
impressions
as
are
made
by
knowledge
gained
in
operations
on
the
ground
south
of
the
impenetrable
grey
curtain
stretched
across
the
valley
began
a
curious
series
of
moves
a
number
of
federal
prisoners
on
their
way
from
port
republic
to
richmond
saw
pass
them
three
veteran
brigades
the
guards
were
communicative
who
are
those
those
are
whiting
and
hood
and
lawton
on
their
way
to
reinforce
stonewall
if
we
did
have
to
leave
this
railroad
you
might
see
division
it
just
behind
how
can
lee
spare
it
oh
beauregard
up
from
the
south
to
take
its
place
the
prisoners
arrived
in
richmond
to
their
surprise
and
gratification
the
officers
found
themselves
paroled
and
that
at
once
they
had
a
glimpse
of
an
imposing
review
they
passed
under
escort
lines
of
entrenchments
batteries
and
troops
their
passage
northward
to
mcdowell
lines
at
fredericksburg
was
facilitated
in
a
remarkably
short
space
of
time
they
were
in
washington
insisting
that
longstreet
had
gone
to
the
valley
and
that
beauregard
was
up
from
the
south
they
had
an
impression
that
in
that
glimpse
of
a
big
review
they
had
seen
him
certainly
they
had
seen
somebody
who
looked
as
though
his
name
ought
to
be
pierre
gustave
toutant
beauregard
in
the
mean
time
hood
lawton
and
whiting
actually
arrived
in
the
valley
they
came
into
staunton
in
good
order
veteran
troops
ready
to
march
against
shields
or
fremont
or
banks
or
sigel
to
keep
the
valley
or
to
proceed
against
washington
quite
as
stonewall
jackson
should
desire
seven
thousand
troops
georgia
texas
north
carolina
and
virginia
lean
bronzed
growing
ragged
tall
men
with
eyes
set
well
apart
good
marchers
good
fighters
good
lovers
and
good
there
suddenly
appeared
before
them
on
the
pike
at
staunton
stonewall
jackson
ridden
through
the
night
from
mt
meridian
the
three
brigades
paraded
jackson
rode
up
and
down
the
line
his
fame
had
mounted
high
to
do
with
a
few
men
and
at
a
little
cost
what
by
all
the
rules
of
war
should
have
involved
strong
armies
and
much
bloodshed
that
took
a
generalship
for
which
the
world
was
beginning
to
give
him
credit
with
cross
keys
and
port
republic
began
that
sustained
enthusiasm
which
accompanied
him
to
the
end
now
on
the
march
and
on
the
battlefield
when
he
passed
his
men
cheered
him
wildly
and
throughout
the
south
the
eyes
of
men
and
women
kindled
at
his
name
at
staunton
the
reinforcing
troops
the
greater
number
of
whom
saw
him
for
the
first
time
shouted
for
him
and
woke
the
echoes
grave
and
unsmiling
he
lifted
the
forage
cap
touched
little
sorrel
with
the
spur
and
went
on
by
it
is
not
to
be
doubted
that
he
was
ambitious
and
it
lies
not
in
ambitious
man
no
nor
in
man
of
any
type
to
feel
no
joy
in
such
a
cry
of
recognition
if
he
felt
it
however
he
did
not
evince
it
he
only
jerked
his
hand
into
the
air
and
went
by
two
hours
later
he
rode
back
to
mt
meridian
the
three
brigades
under
orders
to
follow
stayed
only
to
cook
a
day
rations
and
to
repack
their
wagons
their
certainty
was
absolute
we
will
join
the
army
of
the
valley
it
may
then
we
will
march
against
shields
or
fremont
or
maybe
against
banks
or
sigel
breaking
camp
in
the
afternoon
they
moved
down
the
pike
through
a
country
marvellous
to
the
georgians
and
texans
sunset
came
and
still
they
marched
dark
and
still
they
marched
midnight
and
extremely
weary
they
halted
in
a
region
of
hills
running
up
to
the
stars
reveille
sounded
startlingly
soon
the
troops
had
breakfast
while
the
stars
were
fading
and
found
themselves
in
column
on
the
pike
under
the
first
pink
streakings
of
the
dawn
they
looked
around
for
the
army
of
the
valley
a
little
to
the
northeast
showed
a
few
light
curls
of
smoke
such
as
might
be
made
by
picket
fires
they
fancied
too
that
they
heard
from
behind
the
screen
of
hills
faint
bugle
answering
bugle
like
the
cocks
at
morn
if
it
were
so
they
were
thin
and
far
away
horns
of
elfland
evidently
the
three
brigades
must
restrain
their
impatience
for
an
hour
or
two
in
the
upshot
it
proved
that
they
were
not
yet
to
fraternize
with
the
army
of
the
valley
when
presently
they
marched
it
was
the
valley
back
along
the
pike
toward
staunton
the
three
brigadiers
conferred
together
whiting
the
senior
a
veteran
soldier
staunch
and
determined
was
angry
reasonable
men
should
not
be
treated
so
will
start
at
four
general
whiting
and
march
until
midnight
when
you
will
bivouac
at
early
dawn
a
courier
will
bring
you
further
instructions
very
good
we
march
and
bivouac
and
here
the
courier
brigades
of
whiting
hood
and
lawton
will
return
to
staunton
there
they
will
receive
further
instructions
whiting
swore
we
are
getting
a
taste
of
his
quality
with
a
vengeance
very
well
very
well
it
all
right
if
he
wins
through
i
applaud
too
but
by
god
he
ought
to
treat
reasonable
men
so
forward
under
the
stately
trees
at
mt
meridian
in
the
golden
june
weather
the
army
of
the
valley
settled
to
its
satisfaction
that
it
was
about
to
invade
maryland
quite
an
unusual
number
of
straws
showed
which
way
the
wind
was
blowing
northern
news
arrived
by
grapevine
and
northern
papers
told
the
army
that
was
what
it
was
going
to
do
invade
maryland
and
move
on
washington
sixty
thousand
rebels
look
here
boys
look
here
multiplication
by
division
the
yanks
have
split
each
of
us
into
four
richmond
papers
received
by
way
of
staunton
divulged
the
fact
that
troops
had
been
sent
to
the
valley
and
opined
that
the
other
side
of
mason
and
dixon
needed
all
the
men
at
home
the
engineers
received
an
order
to
prepare
a
new
and
elaborate
series
of
maps
of
the
valley
they
were
not
told
to
say
nothing
about
it
so
presently
the
army
knew
that
old
jack
was
having
every
rabbit
track
and
rail
fence
put
down
on
paper
poor
old
valley
wo
she
have
a
scouring
the
sole
question
was
when
would
the
operations
begin
the
foot
cavalry
grew
tired
of
verdant
meads
june
flowers
and
warbling
birds
true
there
were
clear
streams
and
commissary
banks
soap
and
the
clothes
got
gloriously
washed
uniforms
too
got
cleaned
and
patched
going
calling
must
make
a
show
and
shoes
were
cobbled
cartridge
boxes
surreptitiously
cut
to
pieces
for
this
morning
drills
occurred
of
course
and
camp
duties
and
divine
services
but
for
all
these
diversions
the
army
wearied
of
mt
meridian
and
wanted
to
march
twenty
miles
a
day
even
thirty
if
old
jack
put
a
point
on
it
the
foot
cavalry
drew
the
line
at
it
had
tried
this
once
and
once
was
enough
in
small
clasped
diaries
the
front
leaves
given
over
to
a
calendar
a
table
of
weights
and
measures
a
few
census
returns
and
the
list
of
presidents
of
the
united
states
stopping
at
james
buchanan
the
army
recorded
that
nothing
of
interest
happened
at
mt
meridian
and
that
the
boys
were
tired
of
loafing
how
long
were
they
going
to
stay
the
men
pestered
the
company
officers
the
company
asked
the
regimental
field
asked
staff
staff
shook
its
head
and
had
no
idea
a
brigadier
put
the
question
to
ewell
and
old
dick
made
a
statement
which
reached
the
drummer
boys
that
evening
we
are
resting
here
for
just
a
few
days
until
all
the
reinforcements
are
in
and
then
we
will
proceed
to
beat
up
banks
quarters
again
about
strasburg
and
winchester
on
the
morning
of
the
seventeenth
there
was
read
a
general
order
to
be
more
strictly
policed
regimental
and
brigade
drill
ordered
bridge
to
be
constructed
across
the
shenandoah
chapel
to
be
erected
day
of
fasting
and
prayer
for
the
success
of
our
arms
on
the
why
we
are
going
to
stay
here
forever
the
regimental
commanders
walking
away
from
drill
each
found
himself
summoned
to
the
presence
of
his
brigadier
colonel
just
received
this
order
two
days
rations
and
pack
your
wagons
do
it
quietly
by
evening
the
troops
were
in
motion
ewell
leading
brigade
standing
under
arms
upon
a
country
road
the
red
sunset
thrown
back
from
every
musket
barrel
the
brigadier
approached
old
dick
where
he
sat
rifle
beneath
a
locust
tree
might
i
be
told
in
which
direction
sir
ewell
looked
at
him
with
his
bright
round
eyes
bobbed
his
head
and
swore
by
god
general
taylor
i
do
not
know
whether
we
are
to
march
north
south
east
or
west
or
to
march
at
all
there
was
shouting
down
the
line
either
old
jack
or
a
rabbit
five
minutes
and
jackson
came
by
you
will
march
south
general
ewell
the
three
brigades
of
whiting
hood
and
lawton
having
like
the
king
of
france
though
not
with
thirty
thousand
men
marched
up
the
hill
and
down
again
found
at
staunton
lines
of
beautifully
shabby
virginia
central
cars
the
faithful
rickety
engines
the
faithful
overworked
railroad
men
and
a
sealed
order
from
general
jackson
the
cars
and
go
to
gordonsville
go
at
the
reinforcements
from
lee
left
the
valley
of
virginia
without
having
laid
eyes
upon
the
army
they
were
supposed
to
strengthen
they
had
heard
its
bugles
over
the
hilltops
that
was
all
the
army
of
the
valley
marched
south
and
at
waynesboro
struck
the
road
through
rockfish
gap
moving
east
through
magnificent
scenery
it
passed
the
wall
of
the
blue
ridge
and
left
for
a
time
the
valley
of
virginia
cavalry
went
before
the
main
body
cavalry
guarded
the
rear
far
out
on
the
northern
flank
rode
munford
troopers
at
night
picket
duty
proved
heavy
in
the
morning
before
the
bivouacs
were
left
the
troops
were
ordered
to
have
no
conversation
with
people
upon
the
road
if
anybody
asks
you
questions
you
are
to
answer
i
do
know
the
troops
went
on
through
lovely
country
through
the
june
weather
and
they
did
not
know
whither
they
were
going
wandering
in
the
wilderness
said
the
men
good
lord
they
wandered
in
the
wilderness
for
forty
years
oh
that
was
moses
old
jack
us
through
on
in
three
days
the
morning
of
the
nineteenth
found
the
army
bivouacked
near
charlottesville
an
impression
prevailed
heaven
knows
how
or
why
that
banks
had
also
crossed
the
blue
ridge
and
that
the
army
was
about
to
move
to
meet
him
in
madison
county
in
reality
it
moved
to
gordonsville
here
it
found
whiting
hood
and
lawton
come
in
by
train
from
staunton
now
they
fraternized
and
now
the
army
numbered
thousand
men
at
gordonsville
some
hours
were
spent
in
wondering
one
of
the
chaplains
was
however
content
the
presbyterian
pastor
of
the
place
told
him
in
deep
confidence
that
he
had
gathered
at
headquarters
that
at
early
dawn
the
army
would
move
toward
orange
court
house
and
culpeper
thence
on
to
washington
the
army
moved
at
early
dawn
but
it
was
toward
louisa
court
house
cavalry
artillery
and
wagon
trains
proceeded
by
the
red
and
heavy
roads
but
from
gordonsville
on
the
virginia
central
helped
the
infantry
as
best
it
might
the
cars
were
few
and
the
engine
almost
as
overworked
as
the
train
men
but
the
road
did
its
best
the
trains
moved
back
and
forth
took
up
in
succession
the
rear
brigade
and
forwarded
them
on
the
march
the
men
enjoyed
these
lifts
they
scrambled
aboard
hung
out
of
the
window
from
the
platform
and
from
roof
encouraged
the
engine
offered
to
push
the
train
and
made
slighting
remarks
on
the
tameness
of
the
scenery
not
like
god
country
back
over
the
mountains
they
yelled
encouragement
to
the
toiling
column
on
the
red
roads
step
spryer
your
turn
next
being
largely
valley
of
virginia
virginians
louisianians
georgians
texans
and
north
carolinians
the
army
had
acquaintance
slight
or
none
with
the
country
through
which
it
was
passing
gordonsville
left
behind
unfamiliarity
began
what
this
county
what
that
place
over
there
what
that
river
ca
be
the
potomac
can
it
naw
aint
wide
enough
gentlemen
i
think
it
is
the
rappahannock
go
away
it
is
the
headwaters
of
the
york
rapidan
maybe
or
rivanna
probably
pamunkey
or
the
piankatank
where
the
bullfrogs
jump
from
bank
to
bank
why
not
say
the
james
because
it
is
we
know
the
james
maybe
it
the
chickahominy
i
sure
we
marched
far
enough
think
i
hear
mcclellan
cannon
anyhow
say
captain
is
that
the
river
dan
to
give
names
good
lord
i
like
to
see
no
i
would
like
to
see
old
jack
in
the
inquisition
i
was
down
here
once
and
i
think
it
is
the
south
anna
it
could
be
it
could
be
acquia
creek
boys
acquia
creek
absurd
you
are
even
warm
it
might
be
the
north
anna
gentlemen
cease
this
idle
discussion
it
is
the
tiber
on
a
sunny
morning
somewhere
in
this
one
of
texans
chanced
during
a
halt
to
stray
into
a
where
an
cherry
tree
rose
lusciously
above
a
stake
and
rider
fence
the
texan
looked
set
his
musket
against
the
rails
and
proceeded
to
mount
to
a
green
and
leafy
world
where
the
cherries
bobbed
against
his
nose
a
voice
came
to
him
from
below
what
are
you
doing
up
there
sir
the
texan
settled
himself
astride
a
bough
i
do
really
know
do
know
to
what
command
do
you
belong
i
do
know
you
do
know
what
is
your
state
really
and
truly
i
do
o
lord
the
texan
scrambled
down
saluted
most
shamefacedly
the
horseman
looked
hard
and
grim
enough
well
sir
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
and
can
you
give
me
any
reason
why
you
should
not
mount
guard
for
a
month
tears
were
in
the
texan
eyes
general
general
i
did
know
was
you
give
you
my
word
sir
i
thought
it
was
just
anybody
we
had
orders
every
morning
to
say
do
know
and
it
gotten
to
be
a
joke
and
i
was
just
fooling
of
course
sir
i
do
mean
that
it
has
gotten
to
be
a
joke
only
that
we
all
say
do
know
when
we
ask
each
other
questions
and
i
hope
sir
that
you
understand
that
i
did
know
that
was
you
i
understand
said
jackson
you
might
get
me
a
handful
of
cherries
on
the
the
leading
brigades
reached
fredericksburg
is
sunday
said
the
men
that
ought
to
mean
a
battle
while
wood
and
water
were
being
gotten
that
evening
a
rumour
went
like
a
zephyr
from
company
to
company
we
wait
here
until
every
regiment
is
up
then
we
move
north
to
fredericksburg
and
meet
mcdowell
the
morrow
came
a
warm
bright
sunday
the
last
brigade
got
up
the
artillery
arrived
the
head
of
the
ammunition
train
appeared
down
the
road
there
were
divine
services
but
no
battle
the
men
rested
guessing
fredericksburg
and
mcdowell
guessing
richmond
and
mcclellan
guessing
return
to
the
valley
and
shields
fremont
banks
and
sigel
they
knew
now
that
they
were
within
fifty
miles
of
richmond
but
if
they
were
going
there
anyhow
why
why
why
in
the
name
of
common
sense
had
general
lee
sent
whiting
hood
and
lawton
to
the
valley
was
it
reasonable
to
suppose
that
he
had
marched
them
a
hundred
and
twenty
miles
just
to
march
them
back
a
hundred
and
twenty
miles
the
men
agreed
that
it
was
common
sense
still
a
number
had
richmond
firmly
fixed
in
their
minds
others
conceived
it
not
impossible
that
the
army
of
the
valley
might
be
on
its
way
to
tennessee
to
take
memphis
or
even
to
vicksburg
to
sweep
the
foe
from
mississippi
the
men
lounged
beneath
the
trees
or
watched
the
weary
virginia
central
bringing
in
the
fag
end
of
things
fredericksburg
was
now
the
road
terminus
beyond
the
line
had
been
destroyed
by
a
cavalry
raid
of
mcclellan
stonewall
jackson
made
his
headquarters
in
a
quiet
home
shaded
with
trees
and
with
flowers
in
the
yard

space
of
light
both
the
sergeant
and
billy
saw
his
face
the
sergeant
hand

up

with
an
involuntary
jerk
he

he

his
voice
and
not
riding

him
the
sergeant

him
just
so
you
were
obeying
orders
and
watching
and
handling
your
gun
all
right
he
did
care
i
gather
you
did
use
any
cuss
words
he
seemed
kind
of
satisfied
with
you
the
night
was
dark
louisa
county
roads
none
of
the
best
as
the
cocks
were
crowing
a
worthy
farmer
living
near
the
road
was
awakened
by
the
sound
of
horses

who
that
tired
horses

of
them
gone
lame
they
stopping
here
he
slipped
out
of

and
went
to
the
window

light
enough
to
see
by
who
there

confederate
officers
on
important
business

officer
on

business

an
order
from
general
whiting
authorizing
me
to

the
farmer
came
out
of
the
house
into
the
chill
dawn
one
of
the
two
strangers
took
the
stable
key
and
went
off
to
the
building
looming
in
the
background
the
other
sat
stark
and
stiff
in
the
grey
light
the
first
returned
two
in
very
good
condition
sir
if
you
dismount
i
change
saddles
and
leave
our
two
in
the
stalls
the
officer
addressed
took
his
large
feet
out
of
the
stirrups
tucked
his
sabre
under
his
arm
and
stiffly
dismounted
waiting
for
the
fresh
horses
he
looked
at
the
angry
farmer
it
is
for
the
good
of
the
state
sir
moreover
we
leave
you
ours
in
their
places

virginian
as

of
my
folks
in
the
army
and

good
as

other

the
second
soldier
returned
with
the
horses
the
first
mounted
stiffly
pulled
a
forage
cap
over
his
eyes
and
gathered
up
the
reins
the
light
had
now
really
strengthened
all
things
were
less
like
shadows
the
louisa
county
man
saw
his
visitor
somewhat
plainly
and
it
came
into
his
mind
that
he
had
seen
him
before
though
where
or
when
he
was
all
wrapped
up
in
a
cloak
with
a
cap
over
his
eyes
the
two
hurried
away
down
the
richmond
road
and
the
despoiled
farmer
began
to
think
where

see
him

it
beat
quick

bright
marking
the
passage
of
some
regiment
from

to
the

there
it
beat
deep
and
slow
a
muffled
drum
a
dead
march
some
officer
killed
in
a
skirmish
or
dying
in
a
hospital
borne
now
to

elsewhere
quick
and
bright
again
it
meant
home
guards
going
to
drill
from
the
outskirts
of
the
town
might
be
heard
the

blowing
from

the
curls
of

went
up
straight
white
and
feathery
with

might
be
seen
at
various
points
the
crimson

lay
warm
on

on
mellow
red

on
pale
grey

it
touched
old

and
it
gilded

by

through
all
the
leafy
streets
there
was
vivid
movement
in
this
time
and
place
life
was
so
near
to
death
the
ocean
of
pain
and
ruin
so
evidently
beat
against
its
shores
that
from
very
contrast
and
threatened
doom
life
took
a
higher
light
a
deeper
splendour
all
its
notes
resounded
nor
did
it
easily
relinquish
the
major
key
in
the
town
were
many
hospitals
these
were
being
cleaned
aired
and
put
in
order
against
the
impending
battles
the
wounded
in
them
now
chiefly
men
from
the
field
of
seven
pines
looked
on
and
hoped
for
the
best
taking
them
by
and
large
the
wounded
were
a
cheerful
set
many
could
sit
by
the
windows
in
the
perfumed
air
and
watch
the
women
of
the
south
in
their
soft
full
gowns
going
about
their
business
many
of
the
gowns
were
black
about
the
hotels
the
president
house
the
governor
mansion
and
the
capitol
the
movement
was
of
the
official
world
here
were
handsome
men
in
broadcloth
grown
somewhat
thin
somewhat
rusty
but
carefully
preserved
and
brushed
some
were
of
the
old
school
and
still
affected
stocks
and
ruffled
shirts
as
a
rule
they
were
slender
and
tall
and
as
a
rule
wore
their
hair
a
little
long
many
were
good
latinists
most
were
good
speakers
one
and
all
they
served
their
states
as
best
they
knew
how
overworked
and
anxious
facing
privation
here
in
richmond
with
the
knowledge
that
things
were
going
badly
at
home
sitting
long
hours
in
congress
in
the
hall
of
delegates
in
courts
or
offices
struggling
there
with
herculean
difficulties
rising
to
go
out
and
listen
to
telegrams
or
to
read
bulletins
sons
brothers
kinsmen
and
friends
were
in
the
field
this
golden
afternoon
certain
of
the
latter
had
ridden
in
from
the
lines
upon
this
or
that
business
connected
with
their
commands
they
were
not
many
for
all
the
world
knew
there
would
be
a
deadly
fighting
presently
deadly
and
prolonged
men
and
officers
must
stay
within
those
who
were
for
an
hour
in
richmond
in
their
worn
grey
uniforms
with
the
gold
lace
grown
tarnished
impossible
of
replacement
with
their
swords
not
tarnished
their
netted
silk
sashes
their
clear
bright
eyes
and
keen
thin
faces
found
friends
enough
as
they
went
to
and
fro
more
eager
questioners
and
eager
listeners
than
they
could
well
attend
to
one
a
general
officer
a
man
of
in
a
hat
with
a
long
black
plume
with
the
most
charming
blue
eyes
and
a
long
bronze
silky
rippling
beard
which
he
constantly
stroked
could
hardly
move
for
the
throng
about
him
finally
in
the
capitol
square
he
backed
his
horse
against
the
railing
about
the
great
equestrian
washington
the
horse
a
noble
animal
arched
his
neck
there
was
around
it
a
wreath
of
bright
flowers

rider

in
an
enchanting
voice

gentleman
and
he
got
a
fine
army
except
for
poor
latane
we
did
not
lose
a
man
but
i
left
a
general
behind
me
a
general
general
who
stuart
gave
his
golden
laugh
general
consternation
the
sun
slipped
lower
two
horsemen
came
in
by
the
deep
run
road
and
passed
rapidly
eastward
through
the
town
the
afternoon
was
warm
but
the
foremost
wore
a
great
horseman
cloak
it
made
all
outlines
indefinite
and
hid
any
insignia
of
rank
there
was
a
hat
or
cap
too
pulled
low
it
was
dusty
he
rode
fast
and
in
a
cloud
and
there
came
no
recognition
out
of
the
town
on
the
road
he
showed
the
officer
of
the
guard
who
stopped
him
a
pass
signed
lee
and
entered
the
confederate
lines
general
lee
headquarters
they
were
pointed
out
an
old
house
shaded
by
oaks
he
rode
hither
gave
his
horse
to
the
courier
with
him
and
spoke
to
the
aide
who
appeared
tell
general
lee
some
one
from
the
valley
the
aide
shot
a
quick
glance
then
opened
a
door
to
the
left
general
lee
will
be
at
leisure
presently
will
you
wait
here
sir
he
from
the
valley
entered
it
was
a
large
simply
furnished
room
with
steel
engravings
on
the
walls
the
house
of
burgesses
spotswood
on
the
crest
of
the
blue
ridge
with
his
golden
horseshoe
knights
patrick
henry
in
old
john
jefferson
writing
the
declaration
of
independence
washington
receiving
the
sword
of
cornwallis
the
windows
were
open
to
the
afternoon
breeze
and
the
birds
were
singing
in
a
rosebush
outside
there
were
three
men
in
the
room
one
having
a
large
frame
and
a
somewhat
heavy
face
kept
the
chair
beside
the
table
with
a
kind
of
granite
and
stubborn
air
he
rested
like
a
boulder
on
a
mountain
slope
marked
with
old
scars
only
waiting
to
be
set
in
motion
again
to
grind
matters
small
the
second
man
younger
slender
with
a
short
red
beard
leaned
against
the
window
smelled
the
roses
and
listened
to
the
birds
the
third
a
man
of
forty
with
a
gentle
manner
and
very
honest
and
kindly
eyes
studied
the
engravings
all
three
wore
the
stars
of
the
man
from
the
valley
entering
dropped
his
cloak
and
showed
the
same
insignia
hill
leaving
the
engravings
came
forward
and
took
him
by
both
hands
the
two
had
married
sisters
moreover
each
was
possessed
of
fiery
religious
convictions
and
hill
though
without
the
genius
of
the
other
was
a
cool
intelligent
and
determined
fighter
the
two
had
not
met
since
jackson
fame
had
come
upon
him
it
clothed
him
now
like
a
mantle
the
man
sitting
by
the
table
got
ponderously
to
his
feet
the
one
by
the
window
left
the
contemplation
of
the
rosebush
you
know
one
another
by
name
only
i
believe
gentlemen
said
hill
general
jackson
general
longstreet
general
ambrose
powell
hill
the
four
sat
down
jackson
resting
his
sabre
across
his
knees
he
had
upon
him
the
dust
of
three
counties
he
was
all
one
neutral
hue
like
a
faded
leaf
save
that
his
eyes
showed
through
intense
enough
though
quiet
he
was
worn
to
spareness
longstreet
spoke
in
his
heavy
voice
well
general
fate
is
making
of
your
valley
the
flanders
of
this
war
god
made
it
a
highway
sir
we
must
take
it
as
we
find
it
well
said
hill
smiling
since
we
have
a
marlborough
for
that
flanders
jackson
shifted
the
sabre
a
little
marlborough
is
not
my
he
had
circumstances
too
much
with
him
an
inner
door
opened
the
artillery
near
cold
harbour
said
a
voice
cadenced
and
manly
in
a
moment
lee
entered
the
four
rose
he
went
straight
to
stonewall
jackson
laid
one
hand
on
his
shoulder
the
other
on
his
breast
the
two
had
met
perhaps
in
mexico
not
since
now
they
looked
each
other
in
the
eyes
both
were
tall
men
though
lee
was
the
tallest
both
in
grey
both
thin
from
the
fatigue
of
the
field
here
the
resemblance
ended
lee
was
a
model
of
manly
beauty
his
form
like
his
character
was
justly
proportioned
he
had
a
great
head
grandly
based
a
face
of
noble
sweetness
a
step
light
and
dauntless
there
breathed
about
him
something
knightly
something
kingly
an
antique
glamour
sunny
shreds
of
the
golden
age
you
are
welcome
general
jackson
he
said
very
welcome
you
left
frederickshall
last
night
sir
the
army
is
there
it
is
there
sir
you
have
become
a
name
to
conjure
with
general
i
think
that
your
valley
will
never
forget
you
he
took
a
chair
beside
the
table
sit
down
gentlemen
i
have
called
this
council
and
now
the
sun
is
sinking
and
general
jackson
has
far
to
ride
and
we
must
hasten
here
are
the
maps
the
drew
about
the
table
lee
pinned
down
a
map
with
the
small
objects
upon
the
board
then
leaned
back
in
his
chair
this
is
our
first
council
with
general
jackson
we
wait
but
for
the
army
of
the
valley
to
precipitate
certainly
one
great
battle
perhaps
many
battles
i
think
that
the
fighting
about
richmond
will
be
heavier
than
all
that
has
gone
before
an
aide
entered
noiselessly
with
a
paper
in
his
hand
from
the
president
sir
he
said
lee
rose
and
took
the
note
to
the
window
the
four
at
table
spoke
together
in
low
tones
it
is
the
most
difficult
ground
in
the
world
said
hill
have
another
of
it
than
in
your
valley
general
no
broad
pike
through
the
marshes
of
the
chickahominy
are
there
good
maps
no
said
longstreet
damned
bad
jackson
stiffened
hill
came
in
hastily
it
rather
difficult
to
draw
them
accurately
with
a
hundred
and
ten
thousand
yankees
lying
around
loose
they
should
have
been
made
last
year
lee
returned
yes
the
next
ten
days
will
write
a
page
in
blood
he
sighed
i
do
not
like
war
gentlemen
now
to
begin
again
we
are
agreed
that
to
defend
richmond
is
imperative
when
richmond
falls
the
confederacy
falls
it
is
our
capital
and
seat
of
government
here
only
have
we
railroad
communications
with
the
far
south
here
are
our
arsenals
and
military
manufactories
our
depots
of
supply
our
treasury
our
hospitals
our
refugee
women
and
children
the
place
is
our
heart
and
arm
and
brain
must
guard
it
leave
richmond
and
we
must
withdraw
from
virginia
abandon
virginia
and
we
can
on
our
part
no
longer
threaten
the
northern
capital
then
general
jackson
can
not
create
a
panic
every
other
day
nor
will
stanton
then
withdraw
on
every
fresh
alarm
a
division
from
mcclellan
he
leaned
his
head
on
his
hand
while
with
the
firm
fingers
of
the
other
he
measured
the
edge
of
the
table
no
it
is
the
game
of
the
two
capitals
and
the
board
is
the
stretch
of
country
between
to
the
end
they
will
attempt
to
reach
richmond
to
the
end
we
must
prevent
that
mate
let
us
see
their
possible
roads
last
year
mcdowell
tried
it
by
manassas
and
he
failed
it
is
a
strategic
point
manassas
there
may
well
be
fighting
there
again
the
road
by
fredericksburg
they
have
not
tried
that
yet
and
yet
it
has
a
value
now
the
road
that
mcclellan
has
taken
by
sea
to
fortress
monroe
and
so
here
before
us
by
the
york
seeing
that
the
merrimac
kept
him
from
the
james
it
is
the
best
way
yet
though
with
a
modification
it
would
be
better
there
is
a
key
position
which
i
trust
he
not
discover
he
wo
said
hill
succinctly
the
fairies
at
his
cradle
did
give
him
intuition
and
they
made
him
extremely
cautious
he
a
good
fellow
though
lee
nodded
i
have
very
genuine
respect
for
general
mcclellan
he
is
a
gentleman
a
gallant
soldier
and
a
good
general
he
pushed
the
map
before
him
away
and
took
another
of
late
richmond
strongest
defence
has
been
general
jackson
in
the
valley
well
mcdowell
and
fremont
and
banks
may
be
left
awhile
to
guard
that
capital
which
is
so
very
certain
it
is
in
danger
i
propose
now
to
bring
general
jackson
suddenly
upon
mcclellan
right
jackson
who
had
been
holding
himself
with
the
rigidity
of
a
warrior
on
a
tomb
slightly
shifted
the
sabre
and
drew
his
chair
an
inch
nearer
the
his
right
is
on
the
north
bank
of
the
chickahominy
yes
general
stuart
brought
me
much
information
that
i
desired
fitz
john
porter
commands
there
the
army
corps
thousand
men
i
propose
general
that
you
bring
your
troops
as
rapidly
as
possible
from
frederickshall
to
ashland
that
from
ashland
you
march
by
the
ashcake
road
and
merry
oaks
church
to
the
totopotomoy
creek
road
and
that
moving
by
this
to
beaver
dam
creek
you
proceed
to
turn
and
dislodge
porter
and
his
thousand
crumpling
them
back
upon
mcclellan
centre
here
he
pointed
with
a
quill
which
he
took
from
the
good
good
and
the
frontal
attack
general
hill
and
his
division
will
make
that
the
batteries
on
the
chickahominy
will
cover
his
passage
of
the
bridge
general
longstreet
will
support
him
general
magruder
with
general
huger
and
the
reserve
artillery
will
be
left
before
richmond
they
will
so
demonstrate
as
to
distract
general
mcclellan
attention
from
the
city
and
from
his
right
and
general
porter
general
stuart
will
take
position
on
your
line
of
march
from
ashland
and
general
hill
will
support
you
good
good
this
is
the
afternoon
of
the
yes
frederickshall
is
forty
miles
from
this
point
he
touched
the
map
again
now
general
when
can
you
be
here
thursday
morning
the
sir
that
is
very
soon
time
is
everything
in
war
sir
that
is
perfectly
true
but
the
time
is
short
and
the
manoeuvre
delicate
you
and
your
troops
are
at
the
close
of
a
campaign
as
arduous
as
it
is
amazing
the
fatigue
and
the
strain
must
be
great
you
and
general
hill
are
far
apart
and
the
country
between
is
rough
and
unmapped
yet
victory
depends
on
the
simultaneous
blow
jackson
sat
rigid
again
his
hand
stiffly
placed
upon
the
sabre
it
is
not
given
to
man
to
say
with
positiveness
what
he
can
do
sir
but
it
is
necessary
that
this
right
be
turned
before
mcclellan
is
aware
of
his
danger
each
day
makes
it
more
difficult
to
conceal
the
absence
of
my
army
from
the
valley
between
the
danger
of
forced
marching
and
the
obvious
danger
that
lies
in
delay
i
should
choose
the
forced
marching
better
lose
one
man
in
marching
than
five
in
a
battle
not
of
our
selecting
a
straw
may
bring
failure
as
a
straw
may
bring
victory
i
may
fail
but
the
risk
should
be
taken
napoleon
failed
at
eylau
but
his
plan
was
correct
very
well
said
lee
then
the
morning
of
the
be
it
final
orders
shall
await
you
at
ashland
jackson
rose
good
good
by
now
my
horses
will
have
been
changed
i
will
get
back
the
army
was
to
advance
this
morning
to
beaver
dam
station
he
rode
hard
through
the
country
all
night
it
being
the
second
he
had
spent
in
the
saddle
beaver
dam
station
and
the
bivouacking
army
of
the
valley
saw
him
on
tuesday
morning
the
old
jack
back
from
wherever
he
been
went
the
rumour
headquarters
was
established
in
a
hut
or
two
near
the
ruined
railroad
arriving
here
he
summoned
his
staff
and
sent
for
ewell
while
the
former
gathered
he
read
a
report
forwarded
from
munford
in
the
rear
scout
gold
and
jarrow
in
from
the
valley
fremont
still
fortifying
at
strasburg
thinks
you
may
be
at

royal
shields
at

considers
that
you
may
have
gone
to
richmond
but
that
ewell
remains
in
the
valley
with
forty
thousand
men
banks
at
winchester
thinks
you
may
have
gone
against
shields
at
luray
or
king
at
catlett
or
doubleday
at
fredericksburg
or
gone
to
richmond
but
that
ewell
is
moving
west
on
moorefield
good
good
said
jackson
staff
arrived
and
he
proceeded
to
issue
rapid
and
precise
orders
all
given
staff
hurried
off
and
the
general
spoke
to
jim
call
me
when
general
ewell
comes
he
stretched
himself
on
a
bench
in
the
hut
i
am
suffering
he
said
from
fever
and
a
feeling
of
debility
he
drew
his
cloak
about
him
and
closed
his
eyes
it
was
but
half
an
hour
however
that
he
slept
or
did
not
sleep
for
ewell
was
fiery
prompt
the
army
of
the
valley
entered
upon
a
forced
march
through
country
both
difficult
and
strange
it
had
been
of
late
in
the
possession
of
the
enemy
and
the
enemy
had
stretched
felled
trees
across
forest
roads
and
burned
the
bridges
spanning
deep
and
sluggish
creeks
guides
were
at
fault
directions
most
uncertain
the
wood
grew
intolerably
thick
and
the
dust
of
the
roads
was
atrocious
the
air
cut
away
by
the
tall
green
walls
on
either
hand
the
sun
like
a
furnace
seven
times
heated
provisions
had
not
come
up
in
time
at
beaver
dam
station
and
the
troops
marched
upon
gone
were
the
mountains
and
the
mountain
air
present
was
the
languorous
breath
of
the
low
country
it
had
an
upas
quality
dulling
the
brain
retarding
the
step
the
men
were
very
tired
it
was
hot
and
a
low
fever
hung
in
the
air
they
marched
until
late
of
a
night
without
a
moon
and
the
bugles
waked
them
long
ere
dawn
a
mist
hung
over
all
the
levels
presaging
heat
forward
was
a
repetition
of
yesterday
only
accented
the
sun
girded
himself
with
greater
strength
the
dust
grew
more
stifling
the
water
was
bad
gnats
and
mosquitoes
made
a
painful
cloud
the
feet
in
the
ragged
shoes
were
more
stiff
more
swollen
more
abraded
the
moisture
in
the
atmosphere
weakened
like
a
vapour
bath
the
entire
army
foot
cavalry
and
all
marched
with
a
dreadful
slowness
forward
press
forward
press
forward
press
forward
it
grew
to
be
like
the
humming
insects
on
either
hand
a
mere
noise
to
be
expected
going
to
richmond
going
to
richmond
yes
of
course
we
going
to
richmond
unless
indeed
we
going
a
roundabout
way
against
mcdowell
at
fredericksburg
richmond
will
keep
it
has
kept
a
long
time
ever
since
william
byrd
founded
it
general
lee
is
there
and
so
it
is
all
right
and
we
ca
go
any
faster
war
is
all
it
cracked
up
to
be
oh
hot
hot
hot
and
skeetery
and
general
humidity
lives
down
this
way
forward
press
forward
press
forward
if
that
noise
stop
i
up
with
my
musket
butt
and
beat
somebody
brains
out
ashland
was
not
reached
until
the
late
evening
of
this
day
the
men
fell
upon
the
earth
even
under
the
bronze
there
could
be
seen
dark
circles
under
their
eyes
and
their
lips
were
without
colour
jackson
rode
along
the
lines
and
looked
there
were
circles
beneath
his
own
eyes
and
his
lips
shut
thin
and
grey
let
them
rest
he
said
imperturbably
until
dawn
there
rode
beside
him
an
officer
from
lee
he
had
now
the
latter
general
order
and
he
was
almost
a
day
behind
somewhat
later
in
the
house
which
he
occupied

chief

at

the
bugles
blew
again
there
was
incalculable
delay
the
sun
was
up
ere
the
army
of
the
valley
left
ashland
it
was
marching
now
in
double
column
jackson
by
the
ashcake
road
and
merry
oaks
church
ewell
striking
across
country
the
rendezvous
pole
green
church
a
little
north
and
east
of
mechanicsville
and
the
federal
right
the
distance
that
each
must
travel
was
something
like
sixteen
miles
the
spell
of
yesterday
persisted
and
became
the
spell
of
sixteen
miles
would
have
been
nothing
in
the
valley
in
these
green
and
glamoury
lowlands
they
became
like
fifty
stuart
cavalry
began
to
appear
patrols
here
patrols
there
vedettes
rising
stark
from
the
broom
sedge
or
looming
double
horsemen
and
shadow
above
and
within
some
piece
of
water
dark
still
and
clear
time
was
when
the
army
of
the
valley
would
have
been
curious
and
excited
enough
over
jeb
stuart
troopers
but
now
it
regarded
them
indifferently
with
eyes
glazed
with
fatigue
at
nine
the
army
crossed
the
ruined
line
of
the
virginia
central
texans
leading
an
hour
later
it
turned
southward
stuart
on
the
long
column
left
flank
screening
it
from
observation
and
skirmishing
hotly
through
the
hours
that
ensued
the
army
crossed
crump
creek
passed
taliaferro
mill
crossed
other
creeks
crept
southward
through
hot
thick
woods
came
and
passed
the
head
of
the
column
turned
east
and
came
shortly
to
a
here
awaiting
it
was
stuart
himself
in
his
fighting
jacket
jackson
drew
up
little
sorrel
beside
him
general
general
or
rather
i
had
hoped
to
see
you
many
hours
ago
my
men
are
not
superhuman
sir
there
have
occurred
delays
but
god
is
over
us
still
he
rode
on
stuart
looking
after
him
raised
his
brows
in
my
opinion
hill
is
waiting
for
a
man
in
a
trance
the
army
turned
southward
again
marching
now
toward
totopotomoy
creek
the
head
of
the
column
approaching
it
at
three
smoke
before
the
men
thick
pungent
told
a
tale
to
which
they
were
used
bridge
on
fire
it
was
and
on
the
far
side
of
the
creek
appeared
a
party
in
blue
engaged
in
obstructing
the
road
hood
texans
gave
a
faint
cheer
and
dashed
across
disappearing
in
flame
emerging
from
it
and
falling
upon
the
blue
working
party
reilly
battery
was
brought
up
a
shell
or
two
fired
the
blue
left
the
field
and
the
grey
pioneers
somehow
fought
the
flames
and
rebuilt
the
bridge
an
hour
was
gone
before
the
advance
could
cross
on
a
trembling
structure
over
at
last
the
troops
went
on
southward
still
to
hundley
corner
here
ewell
division
joined
them
and
here
to
the
vague
surprise
of
an
exhausted
army
came
the
order
to
halt
the
army
of
the
valley
went
into
bivouac
three
miles
north
of
that
right
which
hours
before
it
was
to
have
turned
it
was
near
sunset
as
the
troops
stacked
arms
to
the
south
of
them
on
the
other
side
of
beaver
dam
creek
burst
out
an
appalling
cannonade
trimble
a
veteran
warrior
was
near
jackson
that
has
the
sound
of
a
general
engagement
sir
shall
we
advance
jackson
looked
at
him
with
a
curious
serenity
it
is
the
batteries
on
the
chickahominy
covering
general
hill
passage
of
the
stream
he
will
bivouac
over
there
and
will
see
the
battle
have
you
ever
given
much
attention
general
to
the
subject

chapter
xxx
at
the
a
large
warehouse
on
main
street
in
richmond
had
been
converted
into
a
hospital
conveniently
situated
it
had
received
many
of
the
more
desperately
wounded
from
williamsburg
and
seven
pines
and
from
the
skirmishes
about
the
chickahominy
and
up
and
down
the
peninsula
typhoid
and
malarial
cases
sent
in
from
the
lines
were
also
here
in
abundance
to
a
great
extent
as
june
wore
on
the
wounded
from
williamsburg
and
seven
pines
had
died
and
been
buried
or
recovered
and
returned
to
their
regiments
or
in
case
of
amputations
been
carried
away
after
awhile
by
their
relatives
typhoid
and
malaria
could
hardly
be
said
to
decrease
but
yet
two
days
before
the
battle
of
mechanicsville
the
warehouse
seemed
comparatively
speaking
a
cool
and
empty
place
it
was
being
prepared
against
the
battles
for
which
the
beleaguered
city
waited
waited
heartsick
and
aghast
or
lifted
and
fevered
as
the
case
might
be
on
the
whole
the
tragic
mask
was
not
worn
the
city
determinedly
smiled
the
three
floors
of
the
warehouse
roughly
divided
into
wards
smelled
of
strong
soap
and
water
and
disinfectants
the
windows
were
wide
swish
swish
went
the
mops
upon
the
floors
a
soldier
with
his
bandaged
leg
stretched
on
a
chair
before
him
took
to
scolding
women
certainly
are
funny
what
the
sense
of
wiping
down
walls
and
letting
james
river
run
over
the
floors
might
be
some
sense
in
doing
it
the
battle
here
sukey
do
splash
that
water
this
wo
keep
the
blood
from
the
floor
when
they
all
come
piling
in
here
and
makes
all
of
us
damned
uncomfortable
beg
your
pardon
randolph
did
see
you
yes
i
should
like
a
game
of
checkers
if
we
can
find
an
island
to
play
on
the
day
wore
on
in
the
hospital
floors
and
walls
were
all
scrubbed
glistening
a
sunday
freshness
everywhere
the
men
agreed
that
housecleaning
was
all
right
after
it
was
over
the
remnant
of
the
wounded
occupied
the
lower
floor
typhoid
malaria
and
other
ills
were
upstairs
stores
were
being
brought
in
packages
of
clothing
and
lint
received
at
the
door
a
favorite
surgeon
made
his
rounds
he
was
cool
and
jaunty
his
hands
in
his
pockets
a
rose
in
his
buttonhole
what
are
you
malingerers
doing
here
anyhow
you
eating
your
white
bread
with
honey
on
it
you
are
propped
up
and
walking
around
mcguire
reading
to
you
randolph
smilingly
letting
you
beat
her
at
her
own
game
miss
cooper
writing
beautiful
letters
for
you
miss
cary
leaving
really
ill
people
upstairs
just
because
one
of
you
is
an
albemarle
man
and
might
recognize
a
home
face
well
eat
the
whole
slice
up
honey
and
all
for
most
of
you
are
going
home
yes
yes
you
well
enough
and
we
want
all
the
room
we
can
get
he
went
on
judith
cary
with
him
whew
we
must
be
going
to
have
a
fight
said
the
men
seven
pines
seven
pines
was
big
enough
that
was
what
i
thought
facing
casey
guns
your
move
mrs
randolph
the
surgeon
and
nurse
went
on
through
cool
almost
empty
spaces
this
is
going
said
the
surgeon
crisply
to
be
an
awful
big
war
i
should
be
surprised
if
it
makes
a
napoleonic
thunder
down
the
ages
becomes
a
mighty
legend
like
greece
and
troy
and
do
you
know
miss
cary
the
keystone
of
the
arch
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
is
a
composition
of
three
the
armies
in
the
field
the
women
of
the
south
and
the
servants
you
mean
i
mean
that
the
conduct
of
the
negroes
everywhere
is
an
everlasting
refutation
of
much
of
the
bitter
stuff
which
is
said
by
the
other
side
this
war
would
crumble
like
that
if
with
all
the
white
men
gone
there
were
on
the
plantations
faithlessness
to
trust
hatred
violence
outrage
if
there
were
among
us
in
virginia
alone
half
a
million
incendiaries
there
are
thank
god
instead
we
owe
a
great
debt
of
gratitude
to
a
dark
the
world
knows
pretty
well
what
are
the
armies
in
the
field
but
for
the
women
miss
cary
i
doubt
if
the
world
knows
that
the
women
keep
plantations
servants
armies
and
confederacy
going
i
think
said
judith
that
the
surgeons
should
have
a
noble
statue
even
if
we
do
cut
off
limbs
that
might
have
been
saved
hey
god
knows
they
often
might
and
that
there
haste
and
waste
enough
here
sam
bringing
in
a
visitor
a
general

looks
like
a
titian
i
saw
once
it
is
my
father
said
judith
he
told
me
he
would
come
for
me
a
little
later
father
and
daughter
moving
through
the
ward
found
the
man
from
albemarle
not
one
of
those
who
would
go
away
he
lay
gaunt
and
shattered
with
strained
eyes
and
fingers
picking
at
the
sheet

mocket
roused
himself
for
one
moment
course
i
know
you
general
crops
mighty
fine
this
year
never
saw
such
wheat
the
light
sank
in
his
eyes
his
face
grew
as
it
was
before
and
his
fingers
picked
at
the
sheet
he
spoke
in
a
monotone
we
had
such
a
hard
time
since
we
left
home
we
had
such
a
hard
time
since
we
left
home
we
had
such
a
hard
time
since
we
left
home
we
judith
dashed
her
hand
across
her
eyes
come
away
he
says
just
that
all
the
time
they
moved
through
the
ward
warwick
cary
speaking
to
all
no
men
i
ca
tell
you
just
when
will
be
the
battle
but
we
must
look
for
it
soon
for
one
or
for
many
almost
any
day
now
no
i
can
not
tell
you
if
general
jackson
is
coming
it
is
not
impossible
artillery
that
a
command
to
be
proud
of
let
me
see
your
tiger
head
he
looked
at
the
badge
with
its
motto
and
gave
it
back
smilingly
well
we
do
try
you
do
we
not
on
every
possible
occasion
fifth
north
carolina
wounded
at
williamsburg
king
william
artillery
did
you
hear
what
general
hill
said
at
seven
pines
he
said
that
he
would
rather
be
captain
of
the
king
william
artillery
than
president
of
the
confederate
barksdale
mississippians
why
men
you
are
all
the
men
agreed
with
him
happily
you
got
pretty
gallant
fellows
yourself
general
the
king
william
man
cleared
his
throat
he
got
a
daughter
too
that
i
like
to
i
like
to
that
so
general
said
the
men
that
so
she
a
chip
of
the
old
block
father
and
daughter
laughed
and
went
on
out
of
this
ward
and
into
another
quite
empty
the
two
stood
by
the
door
and
looked
and
that
sadly
enough
all
the
cots
all
the
pallets
said
cary
in
a
low
voice
and
out
in
the
lines
they
who
will
lie
upon
them
and
they
can
not
see
them
stretching
across
their
path
i
do
not
know
which
place
seems
now
the
most
ghostly
here
or
there
it
was
hard
to
get
mattresses
enough
so
many
hospitals
and
every
one
has
given
and
given
and
beds
must
be
kept
for
those
who
will
be
taken
to
private
houses
so
at
last
some
one
thought
of
pew
cushions
they
have
been
taken
from
every
church
in
town
see
sewed
together
they
do
very
well
they
passed
into
a
room
where
a
number
of
tables
were
placed
and
from
this
into
another
where
several
women
were
arranging
articles
on
broad
wooden
shelves
if
you
will
wait
here
i
will
go
slip
on
my
outdoor
dress
one
of
the
women
turned
judith
cousin
cary
come
look
at
these
quilts
which
have
been
sent
from
over
in
chesterfield
she
was
half
laughing
half
crying
rising
suns
and
morning
stars
and
gourds
oh
me
oh
me
i
can
see
the
poor
souls
wrapped
in
them
the
worst
of
it
is
they
all
be
used
and
we
be
thankful
for
them
and
wish
for
more
look
at
this
pile
too
from
town
tarletan
dresses
cut
into
nets
and
these
surgeons
aprons
made
from
damask
tablecloths
and
the
last
fringed
towels
that
somebody
was
saving
with
the
monogram
so
beautifully
done
she
opened
a
closet
door
look
i
scrape
lint
in
my
sleep
every
night
for
a
hundred
years
the
young
girls
rolled
all
these
bandages
another
called
her
attention
will
you
give
me
the
storeroom
key
haxall
has
just
sent
thirty
loaves
of
bread
and
says
she
bake
again
there
more
wine
too
from
laburnum
the
first
came
back
the
room
seems
full
of
things
and
yet
we
have
seen
how
short
a
way
will
go
what
seems
so
much
and
every
home
gets
barer
and
barer
the
merchants
are
as
good
as
gold
they
send
and
send
but
the
stores
are
getting
bare
too
kent
and
paine
gave
bales
and
bales
of
cotton
goods
we
made
them
up
into
these
she
ran
her
hand
over
great
piles
of
nightshirts
and
drawers
but
now
we
see
that
we
have
nothing
like
enough
and
the
store
has
given
as
much
again
and
in
every
lecture
room
in
town
we
are
sewing
hard
to
get
more
and
yet
more
done
in
time
the
country
people
are
so
good
they
have
sent
in
quantities
of
bar
soap
and
we
needed
it
more
than
almost
anything
and
candles
and
coarse
towelling
and
meal
and
bacon
and
hard
enough
to
spare
i
do
doubt
it
all
is
and
look
here
cousin
cary
she
indicated
a
pair
of
crutches
worn
smooth
with
use
to
one
a
slip
of
paper
was
tied
with
a
thread
her
kinsman
bent
forward
and
read
it
kin
mannedge
with
a
judith
returned
in
her
last
year
muslin
soft
and
full
in
the
shady
eugenie
hat
which
had
been
sent
her
from
paris
two
years
ago
it
went
well
with
the
oval
face
the
heavy
bands
of
soft
dark
hair
the
mouth
of
sweetness
and
strength
the
grave
and
beautiful
eyes
father
and
daughter
out
they
stepped
into
the
golden
late
afternoon
main
street
was
crowded
a
battery
four
guns
each
with
six
horses
came
up
it
with
a
heavy
and
jarring
sound
over
the
cobblestones
behind
rode
a
squad
or
two
of
troopers
the
people
on
the
sidewalk
called
to
the
cannoneers
cheerful
greetings
and
inquiries
and
the
cannoneers
and
the
troopers
returned
them
in
kind
the
whole
rumbled
and
clattered
by
then
turned
into
ninth
street
ordered
out
on
mechanicsville
pike
that
all
they
know
said
a
man
the
two
carys
freeing
themselves
from
the
throng
mounted
toward
the
capitol
square
entered
it
and
walked
slowly
through
the
terraced
green
and
leafy
place
there
was
passing
and
repassing
but
on
the
whole
the
place
was
quiet
i
return
to
the
lines
said
warwick
cary
the
battle
can
not
be
long
postponed
i
know
that
you
will
not
repeat
what
i
say
and
so
i
tell
you
that
i
am
sure
general
jackson
is
on
his
way
from
the
valley
any
moment
he
may
arrive
and
then
there
will
be
terrible
fighting
yes
terrible
fighting
look
at
the
squirrels
on
the
grass
as
always
in
the
square
there
were
squirrels
in
the
great
old
trees
and
on
the
ground
below
and
as
always
there
were
negro
nurses
bright
turbaned
aproned
ample
formed
and
capable
with
them
were
their
charges
in
perambulators
or
if
older
flitting
like
white
butterflies
over
the
slopes
of
grass
a
child
of
three
in
her
hand
a
nut
for
the
squirrel
started
to
cross
the
path
tripped
and
fell
general
cary
picked
her
up
and
kneeling
brushed
the
dust
from
her
frock
wooing
her
to
smiles
with
a
face
and
voice
there
was
no
resisting
she
presently
fell
in
love
with
the
stars
on
his
collar
then
transferred
her
affection
to
his
sword
hilt
her
mammy
came
hurrying
ef
i
tuhn
my
haid
sumpin
bound
ter
happen
happen
dat
minute
dar
now
you

released
the

went
on
have
you
seen
edward
yes
three
days
ago
pagan
insouciant
and
happy
the
men
adore
him
fauquier
is
here
oh
i
have
not
seen
him
for
so
long
he
will
be
at
the
president
i
think
you
had
best
go
with
me
if
you
think
so
father
i
know
dear
child
that
poor
brave
boy
in
his
cadet
grey
and
but
richard
is
a
brave
man
and
their
mother
is
heroic
it
is
of
the
living
we
must
think
and
this
cause
of
ours
we
are
on
the
eve
of
something
terrible
judith
when
jackson
comes
general
lee
will
have
thousand
men
without
reinforcements
with
mcdowell
still
away
mcclellan
must
number
an
hundred
and
ten
thousand
north
and
south
we
are
going
to
grapple
in
swamp
and
poisoned
field
and
dark
forest
we
are
gladiators
stripped
and
which
will
conquer
the
gods
alone
can
tell
but
we
ourselves
can
tell
that
we
are
determined
that
each
side
is
determined
and
that
the
grapple
will
be
of
giants
well
i
think
the
officers
who
chance
to
be
in
town
will
go
to
the
president
house
with
these
thoughts
in
mind
we
return
to
the
lines
and
a
great
battle
chant
will
be
written
before
we
tread
these
streets
again
for
us
it
may
be
a
paean
or
it
may
be
a
dirge
and
only
the
gods
know
which
we
salute
our
flag
the
government
that
may
last
as
lasted
greece
or
rome
or
the
government
which
may
perish
not
two
years
old
i
think
that
general
lee
will
be
there
for
a
short
time
it
is
something
like
a
recognition
of
the
moment
a
libation
and
whether
to
life
or
to
death
to
an
oak
that
shall
live
a
thousand
years
or
to
a
dead
child
among
nations
there
is
not
one
living
soul
that
knows
i
will
go
father
of
course
will
you
come
for
me
i
or
fauquier
i
am
going
to
leave
you
here
at
the
gates
there
is
something
i
wish
to
see
the
governor
about
at
the
mansion
he
kissed
her
and
let
her
go
stood
watching
her
out
of
the
square
and
across
the
street
then
with
a
sigh
turned
away
to
the
mansion
judith
now
on
the
pavement
by
paul
hesitated
a
moment
there
was
an
afternoon
service
women
whom
she
knew
and
women
whom
she
did
not
know
were
going
in
silent
or
speaking
each
to
each
in
subdued
voices
men
too
were
entering
though
not
many
a
few
were
in
uniform
others
as
they
came
from
the
capitol
or
from
office
or
department
judith
too
mounted
the
steps
she
was
very
tired
and
her
religion
was
an
one
but
there
came
upon
her
a
craving
for
the
quiet
within
paul
and
for
the
beautiful
old
sonorous
words
she
entered
found
a
shadowy
pew
beneath
the
gallery
and
knelt
a
moment
as
she
rose
another
having
perhaps
marked
her
as
she
entered
paused
at
the
door
of
the
pew
she
saw
who
it
was
put
out
a
hand
and
drew
her
in
margaret
cleave
in
her
black
dress
smiled
touched
the
younger
woman
forehead
with
her
lips
and
sat
beside
her
the
church
was
not
half
filled
there
were
no
people
very
near
them
and
when
presently
there
was
singing
the
sweet
lines
beat
distantly
on
the
shores
of
their
consciousness
they
sat
hand
in
hand
each
thinking
of
battlefields
the
one
with
a
constant
vision
of
port
republic
the
other
of
some
vast
melancholy
plain
as
was
not
infrequently
the
case
in
the
afternoon
an
army
chaplain
read
the
service
one
stood
now
before
the
lectern
corbin
wood
whispered
judith
margaret
nodded
i
know
we
nursed
him
last
winter
in
winchester
he
came
to
see
me
yesterday
he
knew
about
will
he
told
me
little
things
about
him
dear
things
it
seems
they
were
together
in
an
ambulance
on
the
romney
march
her
whisper
died
she
sat
pale
and
smiling
her
beautiful
hands
lightly
folded
in
her
lap
for
all
the
years
between
them
she
was
in
many
ways
no
older
than
judith
herself
sometimes
the
latter
called
her
cousin
margaret
sometimes
simply
margaret
corbin
wood
read
in
a
mellow
voice
that
made
the
words
a
part
of
the
late
sunlight
slanting
in
the
windows
he
raised
his
arm
in
an
occasional
gesture
and
the
sunbeams
showed
the
grey
uniform
beneath
the
robe
and
made
the
bright
buttons
brighter
turnest
man
to
destruction
and
sayest
return
ye
children
of
men
for
a
thousand
years
in
thy
sight
are
but
as
yesterday
when
it
is
past
and
as
a
watch
in
the
the
hour
passed
and
men
and
women
left
paul
the
two
beneath
the
gallery
waited
until
all
were
gone
then
they
themselves
passed
into
the
sunset
street
i
will
walk
home
with
you
said
judith
how
is
miriam
she
is
beginning
to
learn
answered
the
other
just
beginning
poor
darling
child
it
is
fearful
to
be
young
and
to
meet
the
beginning
but
she
is
rousing
herself
she
will
be
brave
at
last
judith
softly
took
the
hand
beside
her
and
lifted
it
to
her
lips
i
do
see
how
your
children
could
help
being
brave
you
are
well
cared
for
where
you
are
yes
indeed
though
if
my
old
friend
had
not
taken
us
in
i
do
not
know
what
we
should
have
done
the
city
is
fearfully
crowded
i
walked
from
the
hospital
with
father
he
says
that
the
battle
will
be
very
soon
i
know
the
cannon
grow
louder
every
night
i
feel
an
assurance
too
that
the
army
is
coming
from
the
valley
sometimes
said
judith
i
say
to
myself
is
a
dream
all
but
one
thing
now
it
is
time
to
wake
up
only
remembering
that
the
one
thing
is
true
but
the
dream
goes
on
and
it
gets
heavier
and
more
painful
yes
said
margaret
but
there
are
great
flashes
of
light
through
it
judith
they
were
walking
beneath
linden
trees
fragrant
and
filled
with
murmurous
sound
the
street
here
was
quiet
only
a
few
passing
people
as
the
two
approached
the
corner
there
turned
it
a
slight
figure
a
girl
dressed
in
homespun
with
a
blue
sunbonnet
in
her
hands
was
a
cheap
covered
with
roses
and
pansies
she
looked
tired
and
discouraged
and
she
set
the
down
on
the
worn
brick
pavement
and
waited
until
the
two
ladies
came
near
please
could
you
tell
me
she
began
in
a
soft
drawling
voice
which
broke
suddenly
oh
cleave
it
mrs
cleave
oh
oh
christianna
maydew
why
christianna
christianna
was
crying
though
evidently
they
were
joyful
tears
i
i
was
so
frightened
in
this
lonely
place
an
an
thunder
run
so
far
away
an
an
billy
an
pap
an
dave
are
here
after
all
an
i
never
saw
so
many
strange
people
an
then
i
saw
oh
oh
so
brushed
aside
in
this
war
city
were
all
unnecessary
conventions
that
the
three
sat
down
quite
naturally
upon
a
wide
church
step
an
old
and
wrinkled
nurse
in
a
turban
like
a
red
tulip
made
room
for
them
moving
aside
a
perambulator
holding
a
sleeping
babe
de
mountains
she
she
oughter
stayed
up
dar
close
ter
hebben
christianna
dried
her
eyes
her
sunbonnet
had
fallen
back
she
looked
like
a
wild
rose
dashed
with
dew
i
am
such
a
fool
to
cry
said
christianna
i
ought
to
be
laughin
an
clappin

a
terrible

as
simply

given
she
began
to
look
fair
and
happy
a
wild
rose
in
sunshine
she
was
in
richmond
and
she
had
found
a
friend
and
the
army
was
surely
coming
as
the
three
rose
from
the
church
step
there
passed
a
knot
of
mounted
soldiers
it
chanced
to
be
the
president
staff
with
several
of
stuart
captains
and
the
plumage
of
these
was
yet
bright
the
confederate
uniform
was
a
handsome
one
these
who
wore
it
were
young
and
handsome
men
from
spur
to
hat
and
plume
they
exercised
a
charm
somewhere
in
the
distance
a
band
was
playing
and
their
noble
mettled
horses
pranced
to
the
music
as
they
passed
they
raised
their
hats
one
who
recognized
judith
swept
his
aside
with
a
gesture
appropriate
to
a
minuet
with
sword
and
spur
with
horses
stepping
to
music
by
they
went
christianna
looked
after
them
with
dazzled
eyes
she
drew
a
fluttering
breath
i
did
know
things
like
that
were
in
the
world
a
little
later
the
three
reached
the
gate
of
the
house
which
sheltered
margaret
and
miriam
i
wo
go
in

smiled
upon
her
it
right
of
course

not
think
that
i
shall
ever
misunderstand

judith
the
other
kissed
her
clinging
for
a
moment
to
her
oh
mother
mother
i
hear
the
cannon
too
louder
and
louder
she
broke
away
i
must
cry
we
must
all
have
large
bright
eyes
like
the
women
in
brussels
when
was
revelry
by
night
is
it
fortunate
that
the
heart
does
show
the
town
was
all
soft
dusk
when
she
came
to
the
kinsman
house
which
had
opened
to
her
crowded
though
it
was
with
refugee
kindred
with
soldier
sons
coming
and
going
it
had
managed
to
give
her
a
small
quiet
niche
a
little
room
in
the
very
arms
of
a
great
old
tulip
tree
the
window
opened
to
the
east
and
the
view
was
obstructed
only
by
the
boughs
of
the
tree
beyond
them
through
leafy
openings
night
by
night
she
watched
a
red
glare
on
the
eastern
horizon
mcclellan
entering
presently
this
room
she
lit
two
candles
placed
them
on
the
dressing
table
and
proceeded
to
make
her
toilette
for
the
president
house
through
the
window
came
the
sound
of
the
restless
city
it
was
like
the
beating
of
a
distant
sea
with
a
ground
swell
presaging
storm
the
wind
blowing
from
the
south
brought
too
the
voice
of
the
river
passionate
over
its
myriad
rocks
around
its
thousand
islets
there
were
odours
of
flowers
somewhere
there
was
jasmine
white
moths
came
in
at
the
window
and
judith
rising
put
glass
over
the
candles
she
sat
brushing
her
long
hair
fevered
with
the
city
fever
she
saw
not
herself
in
the
glass
but
all
the
stress
that
had
been
and
the
stress
that
was
to
be
cleave
latest
letter
had
rested
in
the
bosom
of
her
dress
now
the
thin
oblong
of
bluish
paper
lay
before
her
on
the
dressing
table
the
river
grew
louder
the
wind
from
the
south
stirred
the
masses
of
her
hair
the
jasmine
odour
deepened
she
bent
forward
spreading
her
white
arms
over
the
dark
and
smooth
mahogany
drooped
her
head
upon
them
rested
lip
and
cheek
against
the
paper
the
sound
of
the
warrior
city
the
river
and
the
wind
beat
out
a
rhythm
in
the
room
death
love
death
dear
love
dark
death
eternal
she
rose
laid
the
letter
with
others
from
him
in
an
old
sandalwood
box
coiled
her
hair
and
quickly
dressed
a
little
later
descending
she
found
awaiting
her
in
the
old
formal
quaint
parlour
fauquier
cary
the
two
met
with
warm
affection
younger
by
much
than
was
the
master
of
greenwood
he
was
to
the
latter
children
like
one
of
their
own
generation
an
elder
brother
only
he
held
her
from
him
and
looked
at
her
you
are
a
lovely
woman
judith
did
it
run
the
blockade
judith
laughed
no
i
wear
nothing
that
comes
that
way
it
is
an
old
dress
and
it
is
fortunate
that
easter
darns
so
exquisitely
warwick
will
meet
us
at
the
house
we
both
ride
back
before
dawn
why
i
have
not
seen
you
since
last
summer
no
just
before
manassas
they
went
out
i
should
have
brought
a
carriage
for
you
but
they
are
hard
to
get
i
would
rather
walk
it
is
not
far
you
look
for
the
battle
that
depends
i
imagine
on
jackson
perhaps
perhaps
the
next
day
it
will
be
bloody
fighting
when
it
comes
heigho
the
bricks
of
the
pavement
know
that
said
judith
sometimes
fauquier
you
can
see
horror
on
the
faces
of
these
houses
just
as
plain
and
at
night
i
hear
the
river
reading
the
bulletin
poor
child
yes
we
make
all
nature
a
partner
judith
i
was
glad
to
hear
of
richard
cleave
happiness
as
glad
as
i
was
surprised
why
i
hardly
know
and
yet
i
had
it
firmly
in
mind
that
it
was
maury
stafford
judith
spoke
in
a
pained
voice
i
can
not
imagine
why
so
many
people
should
have
thought
that
yes
and
richard
himself
it
never
was
and
i
know
i
am
no
coquette
no
you
are
not
a
coquette
ideas
like
that
arrive
one
never
knows
how
like
thistledown
in
the
air
and
suddenly
they
are
planted
and
hard
to
uproot
stafford
himself
breathed
it
somehow
that
offends
you
naturally
but
i
should
say
there
was
never
a
man
more
horribly
in
love
it
was
perhaps
a
fixed
idea
with
him
that
he
would
win
you
and
others
misread
it
well
i
am
sorry
for
him
but
i
like
richard
best
and
he
will
make
you
happier
he
talked
on
in
his
dry
attractive
voice
moving
beside
her
slender
wiry
resolute
trained
muscle
and
nerve
from
head
to
foot
i
was
at
the
officer
hospital
this
morning
to
see
carewe
he
was
wounded
at
port
republic
and
his
son
and
an
old
servant
got
him
here
somehow
he
was
talking
about
richard
he
knew
his
father
he
says
he

a
brigadier

first
vacancy
and
that
if
the
war

wo
stop
there
he
go
very
high
you
know
carewe
how
he
talks
by
god
sir
dick
cleave
son
got
the
stuff
in
him
always
was
a
kind
of
dumb
heroic
race
lot
of
iron
ore
in
that
soil
some
gold
too
only
needed
the
prospector
big
public
interest
to
come
along
wonder
if
he
carved
his
name
pretty
high
on
the
cliff
now
judith
i
have
stopped
beneath
this
lamp
just
to
see
you
look
the
transfigured
lover
happier
at
praise
of
him
than
at
garlands
and
garlands
for
yourself
hm
drawn
to
the
life
now
we
go
on
to
the
house
the
president
house
on
shockoe
hill
was
all
alight
men
and
women
entering
between
white
pillars
from
the
long
windows
music
floating
beyond
the
magnolias
and
the
garden
the
ground
dropped
suddenly
far
and
wide
a
vast
horizon
there
showed
the
eastern
sky
and
far
and
wide
below
the
summer
stars
there
flared
along
it
a
reddish
light
the
of
two
armies
the
grey
the
nearer
the
blue
beyond
faint
faint
you
could
hear
the
bugles
it
was
a
dark
night
no
moon
only
the
flicker
of
fireflies
in
magnolias
and
roses
and
the
gush
of
light
from
the
tall
house
the
violins
within
were
playing
trovatore
warwick
cary
an
aide
with
him
came
from
the
direction
of
the
capitol
and
joined
his
daughter
and
brother
the
three
entered
together
there
was
little
formality
in
these
gatherings
at
the
white
house
of
the
confederacy
the
times
were
too
menacing
the
city
too
conversant
with
alarm
bells
sudden
shattering
bugle
notes
thunderclaps
of
cannon
men
and
women
too
close
companions
of
great
and
stern
presences
for
the
exhibition
of
much
care
for
the
minuter
social
embroidery
no
necessary
and
fitting
tracery
was
neglected
but
life
moved
now
in
a
very
intense
white
light
so
deep
and
intense
that
it
drowned
many
things
which
in
other
days
had
had
their
place
in
the
field
of
vision
there
was
an
old
butler
at
the
president
door
and
a
coloured
maid
hovered
near
to
help
with
scarf
or
flounce
if
needed
in
the
hall
were
found
two
volunteer
aides
young
handsome
gay
known
to
all
striking
at
once
the
note
of
welcome
close
within
the
door
stood
a
member
of
the
president
staff
colonel
ives
and
beside
him
his
wife
a
young
graceful
and
accomplished
woman
these
smilingly
greeted
the
coming
or
said
farewell
to
the
parting
guest
the
large
was
fitted
for
conversation
sofas
with
carved
rosewood
backs
flanked
and
faced
by
chairs
were
found
in
corners
and
along
the
walls
an
adjoining
room
not
so
brightly
lit
afforded
further
harbourage
while
without
was
the
pillared
portico
with
roses
and
fireflies
and
a
view
of
the
flare
upon
the
horizon
from
some
hidden
nook
the
violins
played
italian
opera
on
the
mantles
and
on
one
or
two
tables
midsummer
flowers
bloomed
in
parian
vases
scattered
in
groups
through
the
large
room
were
men
in
uniform
and
civilians
in
broadcloth
and
fine
linen
so
peculiarly
constituted
were
the
confederate
armies
that
it
was
usual
to
find
here
a
goodly
number
of
private
soldiers
mingling
with
old
schoolmates
friends
kindred
wearing
the
bars
and
stars
of
lieutenants
captains
majors
colonels
and
brigadiers
but
all
privates
and
all
company
officers
were
with
their
regiments
there
were
not
many
even
of
field
and
staff
it
was
known
to
be
the
eve
of
a
fight
a
very
great
fight
passes
into
town
were
not
easy
to
obtain
those
in
uniform
who
were
here
counted
they
were
high
in
rank
mingling
with
them
were
men
of
the
civil
government
cabinet
officers
senators
congressmen
judges
heads
of
bureaus
and
with
these
men
of
other
affairs
hardly
a
man
but
was
formally
serving
the
south
if
he
were
not
in
the
field
he
was
of

legislatures
if
not
there
then

in

with
the
problem
of

and
wondering
where
the
next
roll
of
paper
was
to
come
from
or
in
the
telegraph
service
shaking
his
head
over
the
latest

or
he
was
experimenting
with

at

a
courage
to
which
were
added
a
certain
colour
and
not
without
value
on
her
page
of
history
the
men
not
in

here
were
doing
their
part
and
it
was
recognized
that
they
were
doing
it
the
women
no
less
of
whom
there
were
a
number
at
the
president
house
this
evening
with
soft
southern
voices
with
flowers
banded
in
their
hair
with
bare
throat
and
arms
with
wide
filmy
effective
dresses
they
moved
through

on

had
come
from

and
they
were
here
now
in
the
lights

lying
there
on

staring
at
that
light
in
the
sky
here
is
the

its
entrance
borne
by
two
servants
was
noted
the
violins
were
hushed
the

she
sang
to
it
in
a
rich
throbbingly
sweet
voice
song
after
song
as
they
were
demanded
conversation
through
the
large
room
did
not
cease
but
voices
were
lowered
and
now
and
then

will
notice
how
emphatic
is
the
testimony
to
song
and
dance
and
gaiety
on
the
eve
of
events
which
are
to
change
the

the

follow
after

a

was
felt
and
the

became
riveted
the

moved
again

have
noticed
that
when
you
hear
music
just
before
battle
the
strain
is
apt
to
run
persistently
in
your
mind
she
ought
to
sing

on
the
portico
in
the
warm
air
there
was
no
moon
and
the
light
in
the
east
was
very
marked
if
we
strike
mcclellan
right
said
the
artillerist
all
this
hill
and
the
ground
to
the
north
of
it
will
be
the
place
from
which
to
watch
the
battle
if
it
lasts
after
nightfall
you
will
see
the
exploding
shells
beautifully
they
stood
at
the
eastern
end
judith
leaning
against
one
of
the
pillars
here
a
poet
and
editor
of
the
literary
joined
them
with
him

young
man
a

the
thorns

and
sweet
there
will
still
be
roses

judith
if
i
could
paint
washington
i
would
take
that
gleam
on
the
horizon
yes
is
it
not
fine
it
is
a
subject
however
for
a
mystic
i
have
an
idea
myself
for
a
picture
if
i
can
get
the
to
paint
it
on
and
if
some
brushes
and
tubes
i
sent
for
ever
get
through
the
block
if
i
had
a
tent
i
certainly
would
give
it
to
you
said
pelham
what
would
you
paint
a
thing
that
happened
ten
days
ago

burial
of
latane
the
women
buried
him
you

at
summer
mrs
brockenborough
and
her
and

me
a
letter
about
it
so
simple
it
wrung
your
heart
god
i
said
roman
things
happen
still
and
i
thought
i
like
to
paint
the
picture
i
read
the
letter
too

the
poet
i
am
making
some
verses
about
it
see
if
you
like
them
for
woman
voice
in
accents
soft
and
low
trembling
with
pity
touched
with
pathos
read
his
hallowed
dust
the
ritual
for
the
dead
is
sown
in
weakness
it
is
raised
in
power
softly
the
promise
floated
on
the
air
while
the
low
breathings
of
the
sunset
hour
came
back
responsive
to
the
mourner
prayer
gently
they
laid
him
underneath
the
sod
and
left
him
with
his
fame
his
country
and
his
god
yes
said
judith
sweetly
and
gravely
how
can
we
but
like
them
and
i
hope
that
you
will
find
the
mr
washington
reentering
presently
the
large
room
they
found
a
vague
stir
people
beginning
to
say
and
yet
lingering

growing
late

some
one
and

an
one
in
his
progress
toward

through
the
streets
like
a

from
the
sun

by
all
kinds
of
people
lacking
only
soldiers
there
seemed
no
soldiers
in
town
miriam
alternately
listless
and
feverishly
animated
explained
matters
to
the
mountain
girl
when
there
to
be
a
battle
every
one
goes
to
the
look
at
that
old
old
old
man
hobbling
on
his
stick

think
that
death
was
right
beside
him
would
you
ready
to
tap
him
on
the
shoulder
and
say
fall

figures
on
a
frieze
come
to
life
the
room
in
which
the
two
girls
sat
was
on
the
ground
floor
of
a
small
house
outside
the
window
was
a
tiny
balcony
with
a
graceful
ironwork
railing
and
heavy
ropes
and
twists
of
wistaria
shaded
this
and
the
window
the
old
brick
sidewalk
was
almost
immediately
below
for
the
most
part
the
people
who
passed
went
by
silently
but
when
there
was
talking
the
two
behind
the
wistaria

hear
a
nurse

his
forehead

a
large
white
handkerchief

from

opposite
direction
a
young
man
a
case
of
surgeon
instruments

monotonously
to

fro
christianna
crooned
shining
river
and
then
shady
grove
outside
on
the
brick
pavement
the
sound
of
feet
went
by
in
a
slender
stream
shady
grove
shady
grove
going
to
church
in
shady
grove
the
stream
without
grew
wide
and
deep
then
hurrying
christianna
looked
over
her
shoulder
then
at
miriam
the
latter
long
lashes
lay
on
her
cheek
beneath
them
glistened
a
tear
but
her
slight
girlish
bosom
rose
and
fell
regularly
christianna

boom

miriam
started
up
with
a
cry
outside
the
window
a
hoarse
and
loud
voice
called
to
some
one
across
the
street
that
beyond
meadow
bridge
ye

boom

miriam
rose
threw
off
the
muslin
sacque
and
began
to
dress
her
eyes
were
narrowed
her
fingers
rapid
and
steady
christianna
opened
the
the
sound
of
the
hurrying
feet
came
strongly
in
and
with
it
voices
the
top
of
the
capitol
see
best
from
there
i
think

hills
toward
the
almshouse

brook

picketed
the
hill
by

president
house

it
christianna
turning
found
miriam
taking
a
hat
from
the
closet
shelf
oh
miss
miriam
you
must
go
miriam
a
changed
creature
steady
and
sure
as
a
fine
rapier
turned
upon
her
yes
i
am
going
christianna
if
you
like
you
may
come
with
me
yes
i
am
well
no
mother

back
she
would
understand
if
i
lay
there
and
listened
i
should
go
mad
get
your
bonnet
and
come
the
cannon
shook
the
air
christianna
got
her
sunbonnet
and
tied
the
strings
with
trembling
fingers
all
the
wild
rose
had
fled
from
her
cheeks
her
lips
looked
pinched
her
eyes
large
and
startled
miriam
glanced
her
way
then
came
and
kissed
her
i
forgot
it
was
your
first
battle
i
got
used
to
them
in
winchester
do
be
afraid
they
went
out
into
the
hot
sunshine
by
now
the
greater
part
of
the
stream
had
hurried
by
they
saw
that
it
flowed
eastward
and
they
followed
the
sun
blazed
down
the
pavement
burned
their
feet
the
mountain
girl
walked
like
a
piece
of
thistledown
miriam
light
and
quick
in
all
her
actions
moved
beside
her
almost
as
easily
it
was
as
though
the
hot
wind
rushing
down
the
street
behind
them
carried
them
on
with
the
dust
and
loosened
leaves
there
were
other
women
with
children
clinging
to
their
hands
one
or
two
had
babes
in
their
arms
there
were
old
men
too
and
several
cripples
the
and
unencumbered
were
blown
ahead
the
dull
sound
rocked
the
air
this
was
a
residence
portion
of
the
city
and
the
houses
looked
lifeless
the
doors
were
wide
the
inmates
gone
only
where
there
was
illness
were
there
faces
at
the
window
looking
out
pale
and
anxious
asking
questions
of
the
hurrying
pale
and
anxious
folk
below
the
cannonading
was
not
yet
continuous
it
spoke
rather
in
sullen
thunders
with
spaces
between
in
which
the
heart
began
to
grow
quiet
then
it
thundered
again
and
the
heart
beat
to
suffocation
the
wind
blew
miriam
and
christianna
toward
the
president
house
tall
austere
it
stood
a
little
coldly
in
the
heat
before
the
door
were
five
saddle
horses
with
a
groom
or
two
the
staff
came
from
the
house
then
the
president
in
grey
confederate
cloth
and
soft
hat
he
spoke
to
one
of
the
officers
in
his
clear
incisive
voice
then
mounted
his
grey
arab
a
child
waved
to
him
from
an
upper
window
he
waved
back
lifted
his
hat
to
the
two
girls
as
they
passed
then
his
staff
behind
him
rode
rapidly
off
toward
the
sound
of
the
firing
miriam
and
christianna
turning
a
little
northward
found
themselves
on
a
hillside
thronged
with
people
it
was
like
a
section
of
an
amphitheatre
and
it
commanded
a
great
stretch
of
lowland
broken
here
and
there
by
slight
elevations
much
of
the
plain
was
in
forest
but
in
some
places
the
corn
was
waving
and
in
others
the
wheat
stood
in
shocks
there
were
marshes
and
boggy
green
meadows
and
old
fields
of
pine
and
broom
sedge
several
roads
could
be
seen
they
all
ran
into
a
long
and
low
cloud
of
smoke
it
veiled
the
northern
horizon
and
out
of
it
came
the
thunder
first
appeared
dull
orange
flashes
then
above
the
thickness
the
small
white
expanding
cloud
made
by
the
bursting
shell
then
to
the
ear
rushed
the
thunder
on
the
plain
from
the
defences
which
rimmed
the
city
northward
to
the
battle
cloud
numbers
of
grey
troops
were
visible
some
motionless
some
marching
they
looked
like
toy
soldiers
the
sun
heightened
red
splashes
that
were
known
to
be
horsemen
could
be
seen
galloping
from
point
to
point
in
the
intervals
between
the
thunders
the
hillside
heard
the
tap
of
drum
and
the
bugles
blowing
the
moving
soldiers
were
going
toward
the
cloud
miriam
and
christianna
sank
down
beneath
a
little
tree
they
were
on
a
facet
of
the
hill
not
quite
so
advantageous
as
others
the
crowded
slopes
were
beyond
however
one
could
see
the
smoke
cloud
and
hear
the
cannon
and
that
was
all
that
could
be
done
anyhow
there
were
men
and
women
about
them
children
boys
the
women
were
the
most
silent
pale
and
silent
the
men
uttered
low
exclamations
or
soliloquies
or
talked
together
the
boys
were
all
but
gleeful
save
when
they
looked
at
the
grown
people
and
then
they
tried
for
solemnity
some
of
the
children
went
to
sleep
a
mother
nursed
her
babe
near
the
foot
of
this
hill
through
a
hollow
there
ran
a
branch
bacon
quarter
branch
here
in
the
seventeenth
century
had
occurred
an
indian
massacre
the
heavy
primeval
woods
had
rung
to
the
whoop
of
the
savage
the
groan
of
the
settler
the
scream
of
english
woman
and
child
the
woods
had
been
long
cut
and
the
red
man
was
gone
war
remained
he
had
only
changed
his
war
paint
and
cry
and
weapons
miriam
clasped
her
thin
brown
hands
about
her
knee
rested
her
chin
on
them
and
fastened
her
great
brown
eyes
on
the
distant
battle
cloud
christianna
her
sunbonnet
pushed
back
looked
too
with
limpid
gaze
were
pap
and
dave
and
billy
fighting
in
that
cloud
it
was
thicker
than
the
morning
mist
in
the
hollow
below
thunder
run
mountain
and
it
was
not
fleecy
pure
and
white
it
was
yellowish
fierce
and
ugly
and
the
sound
that
came
from
it
made
her
heart
beat
thick
and
hard
was
he
there
was
allan
gold
there
in
the
cloud
she
felt
that
she
could
not
sit
still
she
wished
to
walk
toward
it
that
being
impossible
she
began
to
make
a
little
moaning
sound
a
woman
in
black
sitting
on
the
grass
near
her
looked
across
do
she
said
if
you
do
that
all
of
us
will
do
it
we
got
to
keep
calm
if
we
let
go
it
would
be
like
rachel
weeping
try
to
be
quiet
christianna
who
had
moaned
as
she
crooned
hardly
knowing
it
at
once
fell
silent
another
woman
spoke
to
her
would
you
mind
holding
my
baby
my
head
aches
so
i
must
lie
down
here
on
the
grass
just
a
minute
christianna
took
the
baby
she
handled
it
skilfully
and
it
was
presently
cooing
against
her
breast
were
pap
and
dave
over
there
shooting
and
cutting
and
billy
billy
with
a
gun
now
instead
of
the
spear
the
blacksmith
had
made
him
and
allan
gold
was
not
teaching
in
the
schoolhouse
on
thunder
run
the
woman
took
the
baby
back
the
sun
blazed
down
there
came
a
louder
burst
of
sound
a
man
with
a
standing
near
uttered
a
tchk
of
despair
impenetrable
curtain
the
ancients
managed
things
better
they
did
not
fight
in
a
fog
he
seemed
a
person
having
authority
and
the
people
immediately
about
him
appealed
for
information
he
looked
through
the
glass
and
gave
it
and
was
good
too
about
lending
the
glass
it
hill
sure
with
longstreet
to
support
him
it
hill
brigades
that
are
moving
into
the
smoke
most
of
that
firing
is
from
our
batteries
along
the
chickahominy
we
are
going
undoubtedly
to
cross
to
the
north
bank
yes
mcclellan
right
wing
fitz
john
porter
a
good
soldier
oh
he
have
about
thousand
men
a
boy
breathing
excitement
from
top
to
toe
sent
up
a
shrill
voice
is
jackson
coming
sir
are
they
looking
for
jackson
the
soldier
who
had
drunk
the
milk
was
discovered
by
miriam
and
christianna
near
their
tree
he
gave
his
voice
surely
he
have
come
down
from
ashland
and
hill
is
crossing
here
that
an
army
north
and
a
big
lot
of
troops
south
and
fitz
john
porter
is
between
like
a
nut
in
a
nut
cracker
the
cracker
has
only
to
work
all
right
and
crush
goes
the
filbert
he
raised
himself
and
peered
under
puckered
brows
at
the
horizon
yes
he
surely
over
there
going
to
flank
fitz
john
porter
then
we
hear
a
hell
of
a
fuss
there
a
battery
galloping
to
the
front
said
the
man
with
the
glass
look
one
of
you
wipe
the
glass
it
gets
misty
if
it
the
purcell
i
got
two
sons
the
soldier
took
the
glass
turning
it
deftly
with
one
hand
yes
think
it
is
the
purcell
do
you
worry
sir
they
all
right
artillerymen
are
hard
to
kill
that
pender
brigade
going
now
christianna
clutched
miriam
look
look
oh
what
is
it
it
soared
into
the
blue
above
the
smoke
the
sunlight
struck
it
and
it
became
a
beautiful
iridescent
bubble
large
as
the
moon
oh
oh
cried
the
boy
look
at
the
balloon
the
hillside
kept
silence
for
a
moment
while
it
gazed
then
is
it
ours
no
it
is
theirs
it
is
going
up
from
the
hill
behind
beaver
dam
oh
it
is
lovely
lovely
no
no
it
is
horrible
look
look
there
is
another
a
young
man
a
mechanic
with
sleeves
rolled
up
began
to
expatiate
on
ours
we
have
got
but
one
it
was
made
in
savannah
by
langon
cheves
maybe
they
send
it
up
maybe
not
i
seen
it
like
joseph
coat
in
the
bible
they
say
the
ladies
gave
their
silk
dresses
for
it
here
be
a
strip
of
purple
and
here
one
of
white
with
roses
on
it
and
here
it
is
black
and
here
it
is
yellow
as
gold
they
melted
rubber
in
naphtha
and
varnished
it
with
that
and
they
going
to
fill
it
with
city
gas
at
the
gas
works
the
bubbles
floated
in
the
clear
air
above
and
beyond
the
zone
of
smoke
it
was
now
between
four
and
five
in
the
afternoon
the
slant
rays
of
the
sun
struck
them
and
turned
them
an
old
man
lifted
a
dry
thin
voice
like
a
grasshopper
once
i
went
to
niagara
and
there
was
a
balloon
ascension
everybody
held
their
breath
when
the
fellow
went
up
and
he
got
into
some
trouble
i
do
remember
just
what
it
was
and
we
almost
died
of
anxiety
until
he
came
down
and
when
he
landed
we
almost
cried
we
were
so
glad
and
we
patted
him
on
the
back
and
hurrahed
and
he
was
a
yankee
too
and
now
it
war
time
and
there
nothing
i
like
better
than
to
empty
a
revolver
into
that
fine
windbag
the
sound
in
the
air
became
heavier
a
man
on
horseback
spurred
along
the
base
of
the
hill
the
people
nearest
stopped
him
tell
you
i
ca
tell
you
nobody
ever
knows
anything
about
a
battle
till
over
and
not
much
then
is
jackson
over
there
i
do
know
he
ought
to
be
so
i
reckon
he
is
if
he
is
it
hill
battle
all
alone
he
was
gone
i
do
believe
it
much
more
than
firing
yet
said
the
soldier
our
batteries
on
the
chickahominy
and
they
are
answering
from
somewhere
beyond
beaver
dam
creek
no
musketry
hello
the
tune
changing
it
changed
with
such
violence
that
after
a
moment
exclamation
the
people
sat
or
stood
in
silence
pale
and
awed
speculation
ceased
the
plunging
torrent
of
sound
whelmed
the
mind
and
stilled
the
tongue
the
soldier
held
out
a
moment
close
range
now
the
north
always
going
to
beat
us
when
it
comes
to
metal
soldiers
i
wonder
how
many
they
got
over
there
anyhow
then
he
too
fell
silent
the
deep
and
heavy
booming
shook
air
and
earth
it
came
no
longer
in
distinct
shocks
but
with
a
continuous
roar
the
smoke
screen
grew
denser
and
taller
mounting
toward
the
balloons
there
was
no
seeing
for
that
curtain
it
could
only
be
noted
that
bodies
of
grey
troops
moved
toward
it
went
behind
it
a
thin
elderly
man
a
borrowed
the
glass
fixed
it
but
could
see
nothing
he
gave
it
back
with
a
shake
of
the
head
sat
down
again
on
the
parched
grass
and
veiled
his
eyes
with
his
hand
is
murky
he
said
no
lull
occurred
in
the
firing
the
sun
as
it
sank
reddened
the
battle
cloud
that
by
now
had
blotted
out
the
balloons
when
it
is
dark
said
the
soldier
it
will
be
like
fireworks
an
hour
later
the
man
with
the
glass
discovered
a
string
of
wagons
on
one
of
the
roads
it
was
coming
citywards
ambulances
he
said
in
a
shaking
voice
ambulances
ambulances
the
word
went
through
the
crowd
like
a
sigh
it
broke
the
spell
most
on
the
hillside
might
have
an
interest
there
parents
wives
brothers
sisters
children
they
rose
they
went
away
in
the
twilight
like
blown
leaves
the
air
was
rocking
orange
and
red
lights
began
to
show
as
the
shells
exploded
christianna

her
hand
on
miriam

brother
might
be
there
the
long
june
dusk
melted
into
night
and
still
the
city
shook
to
the
furious
cannonading
with
the
dark
it
saw
as
it
had
not
seen
in
the
sunshine
as
the
soldier
said
it
was
like
fireworks
beginning
at
twilight
the
wagons
with
the
wounded
came
all
night
long
ambulances
farm
wagons
carts
family
carriages
they
rumbled
over
the
cobblestones
with
the
sound
of
the
tumbrels
in
the
terror
it
was
stated
that
a
number
of
the
wounded
were
in
the
field
hospitals
in
the
morning
the
knowledge
was
general
that
very
many
had
lain
crying
for
water
all
night
in
the
slashing
before
beaver
dam
creek
all
the
houses
in
richmond
were
lighted
through
the
streets
poured
a
tide
of
fevered
life
news
news
news
demanded
from
chance
couriers
from
civilian
spectators
of
the
battle
arriving
pale
and
exhausted
from
the
drivers
of
wagon
cart
and
carriage
from
the
less
badly
wounded
ours

in
the
hot
summer

exaltation
fever
it
breathed
in
the
hot
wind
it
flickered
in
the
lights
it
sounded
in
the
voice
of
the
river
for
many
there
sounded
woe
as
well
woe
and
wailing
for
the
dead
for
others
for
many
many
others
there
was
a
misery
of
searching
a

the
cannon
stopped
at
nine
the
stonewall
hospital
was
poorly
lighted
in

the
oil
lamps
stuck
in
brackets
along
the
walls
smoked
at
one
end
where
two
pine
tables
were
placed
the
air
from
the
open
window
blew
the
flames
distractingly
a
surgeon
half
dead
with
fatigue
strained
to
the
point
of
tears
exclaimed
upon
it
that
damned
wind

the
window

the
window
as

did
so
she
looked
once
at
the
light
on
the
northern
horizon
the
firing
shook
the
the
flame
of
the
lamp
now
stood
straight
she
turned
the
wick
higher
then
lifted
a
pitcher
and
poured
water
into
a
basin
and
when
the
surgeon
had
washed
his
hands
took
away
the
reddened
stuff
two
negroes
laid
a
man
on
the
table
a
gaunt
north
carolinian
his
hand
clutching
a
shirt
all
stiffened
blood
between
his
eyelids
showed
a
gleam
of

his
breath

a
whistling

rigid
fingers

the
surgeon
hold

firmly

just
there
he
turned
to
the
adjoining
table
where
a
younger
man
was
sewing
up
a
forearm
ripped
from
wrist
to
elbow
by
a
piece
of
shell

the
younger
surgeon
having
finished
the
cut
wiped
away
with
a
towel
the
sweat
that
blinded
him

in
an
the
next
the
ward
was
long
low
ceiled
with
brown
walls
and
rafters
between
the
patches
of

the
shadows
lay
wide
and
heavy
the
cots
the
pallets
the

cushions
sewed
together
were
placed

close
by
each
a
narrow
aisle
ran
between
the
rows
by

low
bed
there
was
just
standing

the
beds
were
all
filled
and
the
wagons
bringing
more
rumbled
on
the
cobblestones
without
all
the
long
place
was
reekingly
hot
with
a
strong
smell
of
human
effluvia
of
clothing
of
blood
and
powder
grime
there
was
not
much
crying
aloud
only
when
a
man
was
brought
in
raving
or
when
there
came
a
sharp
scream
from
some
form
under
the
surgeon
knife
but
the
place
seemed
one
groan
a
sound
that
swelled
or
sank
but
never
ceased
the
shadows
on
the
wall
fantastically
dancing
mocked
this
with
nods
and
becks
and
waving
arms
mocked
the
groaning
mocked
the
heat
mocked
the
smell
mocked
the
thirst
mocked
nausea
agony
delirium
and
the
rattle
in
the
throat
mocked
the
helpers
and
the
helped
mocked
the
night
and
the

and
the
dying
and
the
dead

broke
cold
and
pure
the

slowly
slowly
turning
to
chill
ethereal

of
violets
the

more
slowly

the

shadowy

deep

that
they
were
under
the
mysterious
light
in
the
realm
of
the
hour
whose
finger
is
at
her
lips
the

made
them
seem
still
and
yet
they
were
not
still
they
and
the
old

and

and
the
wild
and
tangled
banks
of
sluggish
and
the
narrow
hidden
roads
and
the
low

and
all
the
vast
overgrown
and

were
filled
with
the
breathing
of
two
armies
in
the
cold
glory
of

there
faced
each

hundred
and
eighty
thousand
men
bent
on
mutual
destruction

of

marching
toward

all
towered
toward

their
tops
and

pressed
against
their
immemorial
trunks
it
was

solemn
within
such

passed

down

falling

tell
you
that
if

has
well
we
beat

anyhow
this

of

had
done
hard

was

to
rest

in
the
underbrush
in
the
misty
light
beneath
the
tall
treetops
where
the
birds
were
cheeping
in
the
meantime
a
federal
balloon
mounting
into
the
amethyst
air
discovered
that
this
stretch
of
woodland
was
thronged
with
grey
soldiers
and
signalled
as
much
to
fitz
john
porter
falling
back
with
steadiness
to
his
second
line
at
gaines
mill
he
posted
several
batteries
and
ordered
them
to
shell
the
wood
in
the
purple
light
the
guns
began
the
men
in
grey
had
to
take
the
storm
they
were
in
the
wood
and
orders
had
not
come
to
leave
it
they
took
it
in
various
ways
some
sullenly
some
contemptuously
some
with
nervous
twitchings
of
head
and
body
many
with
dry
humour
and
a
quizzical
front
the
confederate
soldier
was
fast
developing
a
characteristic
which
stayed
with
him
to
the
end
he
joked
with
death
and
gave
a
careless
hand
to
suffering
a
few
of
the
more
imaginative
and
aesthetically
minded
lost
themselves
in
contemplation
of
the
bestormed
forest
and
its
behaviour
the
cannonade
was
furious
and
though
not
many
of
the
grey
soldiers
suffered
the
grey
trees
did
great
and
small
branches
were
lopped
off
in
the
dim
light
they
came
tumbling
down
they
were
borne
sideways
tearing
through
the
groves
and
coverts
or
caught
by
an
exploding
shell
and
torn
twig
from
twig
they
fell
in
a
shower
of
slivers
or
chopped
clean
from
the
trunk
down
they
crashed
from
leafy
level
to
level
till
they
reached
the
forest
floor
beneath
them
rose
shouts
of
warning
came
a
scattering
of
grey
mortals
younger
trees
were
cut
short
off
their
woodland
race
was
run
down
they
rushed
with
their
festoons
of
vines
crushing
the
undergrowth
of
laurel
and
hazel
other
shells
struck
the
red
brown
resinous
bodies
of
pines
set
loose
dangerous
mists
of
bark
and
splinter
as
by
a
whirlwind
the
air
was
filled
with
torn
and
flying
growth
with
the
dull
crash
and
leafy
fall
of
the
forest
the
light
was
no
longer
pure
it
was
murky
here
as
elsewhere
the
violet
fields
and
the
vermeil
gardens
were
blotted
out
and
in
the
shrieking
of
the
shells
the
birds
could
not
have
been
heard
to
sing
even
were
they
there
they
were
not
there
they
were
all
flown
far
away
it
was
dark
in
the
wood
dark
and
full
of
sound
and
of
moving
bodies
charged
with
danger
the
whirlwind
swept
it
the
treetops
snapped
off
the
grey
soldiers
were
glad
to
hear
the
word
march
they
were
blithe
to
hear
the
order
and
to
leave
the
wood
they
moved
out
into
old
fields
grown
with
sedge
and
sassafras
here
and
there
dwarf
pines
apparently
the
cannon
had
lost
them
at
any
rate
for
a
time
the
firing
ceased
the
east
was
now
pink
the
air
here
very
pure
and
cool
and
still
each
feather
of
broom
sedge
holding
its
row
of
diamond
dewdrops
the
earth
was
much
cut
up
batteries
been
along
here
said
the
men
ours
too
know
the
wheel
marks
hello
what
you
got
carter
somebody
dropped
his
photograph
album
the
man
in
front
and
the
man
behind
and
the
man
on
the
other
side
all
looked
one
of
those
folding
things
pretty
children
one
two
three
four
and
their
keep
it
for
him
henry
think
the
crenshaw
battery
or
braxton
or
the
king
william
or
the
dixie
was
over
this
way
beyond
the
poisoned
field
were
more
woods
dipping
to
one
of
the
innumerable
sluggish
creeks
of
the
region
there
was
a
bridge
weak
and
shaken
but
still
a
bridge
this
crossed
at
last
the
troops
climbed
a
slippery
bank
beneath
a
wild
tangle
of
shrub
and
vine
and
came
suddenly
into
view
of
a
line
of
breastworks
three
hundred
yards
away
there
was
a
halt
skirmishers
were
thrown
forward
these
returned
without
a
trigger
having
been
pulled
deserted
sir
they
fallen
back
guns
and
all
but
there
a
meadow
between
us
and
the
earthworks
sir
that
that
that
the
column
began
to
move
across
the
meadow
not
a
wide
meadow
a
little
green
boggy
place
commanded
by
the
breastworks
apparently
grey
troops
had
made
a
charge
here
the
evening
before
the
trees
that
fringed
the
small
irregular
oval
and
the
great
birds
that
sat
in
the
trees
and
the
column
whose
coming
had
made
the
birds
to
rise
looked
upon
a
meadow
set
as
thick
with
dead
men
as
it
should
have
been
with
daisies
they
lay
thick
thick
two
hundred
and
fifty
of
them
perhaps
heart
pierced
temple
pierced
by
minie
balls
or
all
the
body
shockingly
torn
by
grape
and
canister
the
wounded
had
been
taken
away
only
the
dead
were
here
watched
by
the
great
birds
the
treetops
and
the
dawn
they
lay
fantastically
some
rounded
into
a
ball
some
spread
eagle
some
with
their
arms
over
their
eyes
some
in
the
posture
of
easy
sleep
at
one
side
was
a
swampy
place
and
on
the
edge
of
this
a
man
sunk
to
the
thigh
kept
upright
the
living
men
thought
him
living
too
more
than
one
started
out
of
line
toward
him
but
then
they
saw
that
half
his
head
was
blown
away
they
left
the
meadow
and
took
a
road
that
skirted
another
great
piece
of
forest
the
sun
came
up
drank
off
the
vagrant
wreaths
of
mist
and
dried
the
dew
from
the
sedge
there
was
promise
of
a
hot
fierce
dazzling
day
another
halt
what
the
matter
this
time
asked
the
men
god
i
want
to
march
on
into
something
happening
rumour
came
back
woods
in
front
of
us
full
of
something
do
know
yet
whether
it
buzzards
or
yankees
get
ready
to
open
fire
anyway
all
ready
the
men
waited
until
she
came
again
it
men
anyhow
woods
just
full
of
bayonets
gleaming
better
throw
your
muskets
forward
the
column
moved
on
but
cautiously
with
a
strong
feeling
that
it
in
its
turn
was
being
watched
with
muskets
thrown
forward
then
suddenly
came
recognition
grey
grey

the
flag

this
army
trained
too
till
it
is
any
more

wonderful
breastworks
mac
a
master
engineer
now
i
clear
out
and
let
you
and
cary
talk
the
two
cousins
sat
down
on
the
grass
beneath
the
sycamore
for
a
little
they
eyed
each
other
in
silence
edward
cary
was
more
beautiful
than
ever
and
apparently
happy
though
one
of
his
shoes
was
nothing
more
than
a
sandal
and
he
was
innocent
of
a
collar
and
his
sleeve
demanded
a
patch
he
was
thin
and
bronzed
and
he
handled
his
rifle
with
lazy
expertness
and
he
looked
at
his
cousin
with
a
genuine
respect
and
liking
richard
i
heard
about
will
i
know
you
were
like
a
father
to
the
boy
i
am
very
sorry
i
know
that
you
are
edward
i
would
rather
not
talk
about
it
please
when
the
country
bleeds
one
must
put
away
private
grief
he
sat
in
the
shade
of
the
tree
thin
and
bronzed
and
like
his
cousin
though
not
ragged
dundee
grazed
at
hand
and
scattered
upon
the
edge
of
the
wood
beneath
the
little
dogwood
trees
lay
like
acorns
his
men
fraternizing
with
the
tuckahoe
regiment
your
father
and
fauquier
both
somewhere
in
this
land
what
a
wilderness
of
creeks
and
woods
it
is
i
slept
last
night
in
a
swamp
and
at
reveille
a
beautiful
moccasin
lay
on
a
log
and
looked
at
me
i
do
think
either
father
or
fauquier
were
engaged
last
evening
pender
and
ripley
bore
the
brunt
of
it
judith
is
in
richmond
yes
i
had
a
letter
from
her
before
we
left
the
valley
i
am
glad
richard
it
is
you
we
were
all
strangely
at
sea
somehow
she
is
a
noble
woman
when
i
look
at
her
i
always
feel
reassured
as
to
the
meaning
and
goal
of
humanity
i
know
i
love
her
dearly
dearly
if
i
outlive
this
battle
i
will
try
to
get
to
see
her
off
somewhere
on
the
left
a
solitary
cannon
boomed
the
grey
soldiers
turned
their
heads
a
signal
somewhere
we
spread
over
all
creation
crossing
here
and
crossing
there
and
every
losing
your
way
it
like
the
maze
we
used
to
read
about
this
bottomless
mountainless
creeky
swampy
feverish
damned
lowland
the
two
beneath
the
sycamore
smiled
to
our
mountains
eh
said
edward
cleave
regarded
the
forest
somewhat
frowningly
we
are
not
he
said
in
a
very
good
humour
this
morning
yesterday
was
a
day
in
which
things
went
wrong
it
was
a
sickening
disappointment
acknowledged
edward
we
listened
and
listened
he
got
a
tremendous
reputation
you
know
jackson
foreordained
and
predestined
to
be
at
the
crucial
point
at
the
critical
moment
backed
alike
by
calvin
and
god
so
we
looked
for
a
comet
to
strike
fitz
john
porter
and
instead
we
were
treated
to
an
eclipse
it
was
a
frightful
slaughter
i
saw
general
lee
afterwards
magnanimous
calm
and
grand
what
was
really
the
reason
cleave
moved
restlessly
i
can
not
say
perhaps
i
might
hazard
a
guess
but
it
no
use
talking
of
guesswork
i
hope
for
a
change
you
consider
him
a
great
general
a
very
great
one
but
he
sprung
from
earth
ascended
like
the
rest
of
us
for
him
as
for
you
and
me
there
the
heel
undipped
and
the
unlucky
day
the
officers
of
the
first
grey
regiment
began
to
bestir
themselves
in
fall
in
fall
in
edward
rose
well
we
shall
see
what
we
shall
see
richard
the
two
shook
hands
warmly
cary
ran
to
his
place
in
the
line
the
tuckahoe
regiment
cheered
by
the
swung
from
the
forest
road
into
a
track
leading
across
an
expanse
of
broom
sedge
it
went
rapidly
the
dew
was
dried
the
mist
lifted
the
sun
blazing
with
all
his
might
during
the
night
the
withdrawing
federals
had
also
travelled
this
road
it
was
cut
by
it
was
strewn
with
abandoned
wagons
ambulances
accoutrements
of
all
kinds
there
were
a
number
of
dead
horses
they
lay
across
the
road
or
to
either
hand
in
the
melancholy
fields
of
sedge
from
some
dead
trees
the
buzzards
watched
one
horse
far
out
in
the
yellow
sedge
lifted
his
head
and
piteously
neighed
the
troops
came
into
the
neighbourhood
of
gaines
mill
through
grille
after
grille
of
woven
twig
and
bamboo
vine
they
descended
to
another
creek
sleeping
and
shadowed
crossed
it
somehow
and
came
up
into
forest
again
before
them
through
the
trees
was
visible
a
great
open
space
hundreds
of
acres
here
and
there
it
rose
into
knolls
and
on
these
were
planted
grey
batteries
beyond
the
open
there
showed
a
horseshoe
of
a
creek
fringed
with
swamp
growth
a
wild
and
tangled
woodland
beyond
this
again
a
precipitous
slope
almost
a
cliff
mounting
to
a
wide
plateau
all
the
side
of
the
ascent
was
occupied
by
admirable
breastworks
triple
lines
one
above
the
other
while
at
the
base
between
hill
and
creek
within
the
enshadowing
forest
was
planted
a
great
abattis
of
logs
and
felled
trees
behind
the
breastwork
and
on
the
plateau
rested
fitz
john
porter
reinforced
during
the
night
by
slocum
and
now
commanding
thousand
disciplined
and
courageous
troops
batteries
frowned
upon
the
plain
below
the
federal
drums
were
beating
beating
beating
the
grey
soldiers
lay
down
in
the
woods
and
awaited
orders
they
felt
rather
than
saw
that
other
troops
were
all
about
them
hill
longstreet
couched
in
the
wide
woods
strung
in
the
brush
that
bordered
creek
and
swamp
massed
in
the
shelter
of
the
few
low
knolls
they
waited
long
the
sun
blazed
high
and
higher
then
a
grey
battery
just
in
front
of
this
strip
of
woods
opened
with
a
howitzer
the
shell
went
singing
on
its
errand
exploded
before
one
of
the
triple
tiers
the
plateau
answered
with
a
the
missile
came
toward
the
battery
overpassed
it
and
exploded
above
the
wood
it
looked
as
large
as
a
beehive
it
came
with
an
awful
sound
and
when
it
burst
the
atmosphere
seemed
to
rock
the
men
lying
on
the
earth
beneath
jerked
back
their
heads
threw
an
arm
over
their
eyes
made
a
dry
clicking
sound
with
their
tongue
against
their
teeth
the
howitzer
and
this
shell
opened
the
battle
again
hill
battle
over
in
the
forest
on
the
left
near
cold
harbour
where
stonewall
jackson
had
his
four
divisions
his
own
hill
ewell
and
whiting
there
was
long
long
waiting
the
men
had
all
the
rest
they
wanted
and
more
besides
they
fretted
they
grew
querulous
oh
good
god
why
do
we
move
there
firing
heavy
firing
on
the
right
are
we
going
to
lie
here
in
these
swamps
and
fight
mosquitoes
all
day
thought
we
were
brought
here
to
fight
yankees
the
general
walking
in
the
forest
and
saying
his
prayers
oh
go
to
hell
a
battery
far
over
on
the
edge
of
a
swamp
broke
loose
tearing
the
sultry
air
with
shell
after
shell
tossed
against
a
federal
breastwork
on
the
other
side
of
the
marsh
the
stonewall
brigade
grew
vividly
interested
that
hill
over
there
hill
is
a
fighter
from
way
back
o
lord
why
do
we
fight
too
holy
moses
what
a
racket
the
blazing
noon
filled
with
crash
and
roar
ten
of
fitz
john
guns
opened
on
the
adventurous
battery
it
had
nerve
sheer
grit
enough
for
a
dozen
but
it
was
one
by
one
its
guns
were
silenced
most
of
the
horses
down
most
of
the
cannoneers
hill
recalled
it
a
little
later
he
received
an
order
from
jackson
general
hill
will
withdraw
his
troops
to
the
left
of
the
road
in
rear
of
his
present
position
where
he
will
await
further
orders

with
shut

o
god
have
mercy
this
the

of
the
valley
allan
gold
detached
at
dawn
on
scout
duty
found
himself
about
this
time
nearer
to
the
confederate
centre
than
to
his
own
base
of
operations
at
the
left
he
had
been
marking
the
windings
of
creeks
observing
where
there
were
bridges
and
where
there
were
none
the
depth
of
channels
and
the
infirmness
of
marshes
he
had
noted
the
federal
positions
and
the
amount
of
stores
abandoned
set
on
fire
good
rice
and
meat
good

had
given

had
killed
with
the
butt
of
his
rifle
a
hissing
and
coiled
snake
he
had
turned
his
eyes
away
from
the
black

winged
covering
of
a
dead
horse
and
rider
kneeling
at
last
to
drink
at
a
narrow
hidden
creek
slumbering
between
trees
he
had
raised
his
eyes
and
on
the
other
side
marked
a
blue
scout
looking
startled
out
of
a
hazel
bush
there
was
a
click
from
two
muskets
then
allan
said

said
allan
and
have
a
beautiful
wedding
the
blue
vanished
in
the
underbrush
the
grey
went
on
his
way
through
the
heavy
forest
he
was
moving
now
toward
sound
heavy
increasing
presaging
a
realm
of
jarred
air
and
ringing
ahead
he
saw
a
column
of
swiftly
moving
troops
half
running
he
overtook
the
rear
file
scout
yes
stonewall
brigade
all
right
all
right
this
is
hill
going
into
battle
come
on
if
you
want
to
through
the
thinning
woods
showed
a
great
open
plain
with
knolls
where
batteries
were
planted
the
regiment
to
which
allan
had
attached
himself
lay
down
on
the
edge
of
the
wood
near
one
of
the
eminences
allan
stretched
himself
beneath
a
black
gum
at
the
side
of
the
road
everywhere
was
a
rolling
smoke
everywhere
terrific
sound
a
battery
thundered
by
at
a
gallop
six
horses
to
each
gun
straining
it
struck
across
a
corner
of
the
plain
over
it
burst
the
shells
a
horse
went
down
the
drivers
cut
the
traces
a
caisson
was
struck
exploded
with
frightful
glare
and
sound
about
it
when
the
smoke
cleared
writhed
men
and
horses
but
the
gun
was
dragged
off
through
the
rain
of
shells
the
battery
gained
a
lift
of
ground
toiled
up
it
placed
the
guns
unlimbered
and
began
to
fire
a
south
carolina
brigade
started
with
a
yell
from
the
woods
to
the
right
tore
in
a
dust
cloud
across
the
old
fields
furrowed
with
gullies
and
was
swallowed
in
the
forest
about
the
creek
which
laved
the
base
of
the
federal
position
this
rose
from
the
level
like
a
gibraltar
and
about
it
now
beat
a
wild
shouting
and
rattle
of
musketry
allan
rose
to
his
knees
then
to
his
feet
then
drawn
as
by
a
magnet
crept
through
a
finger
of
sumach
and
sassafras
outstretched
from
the
wood
to
a
better
vantage
point
just
in
rear
of
the
battery
behind
him
through
the
woods
came
a
clatter
of
horses
hoofs
it
was
met
and
followed
by
cheering
turning
his
head
he
saw
a
general
and
his
staff
and
though
he
had
never
seen
lee
he
knew
that
this
was
lee
and
himself
began
to
cheer
the
lifted
his
grey
hat
came
down
the
dim
overarched
road
between
the
cheering
troops
with
his
staff
he
left
the
wood
for
the
open
riding
beneath
the
shelter
by
the
finger
of
sumach
and
sassafras
toward
the
battery
he
saw
allan
and
reined
up
traveller
you
do
not
belong
to
this
a
scout
general
jackson
ah
well
i
expect
general
jackson
to
strike
those
people
on
the
right
any
moment
now
he
rode
up
to
the
battery
the
shells
were
raining
bursting
above
around
in
the
shelter
of
the
hill
the
battery
horses
had
at
first
veteran
undisturbed
cropped
the
parched
grass
but
now
one
was
wounded
and
now
another
an
arm
was
torn
from
a
gunner
a
second
stooping
over
a
limber
chest
was
struck
between
the
shoulders
crushed
flesh
and
bone
into
pulp
the
artillery
captain
came
up
to
the
general
lee
wo
you
go
away
gentlemen
wo
you
tell
him
that
danger
the
staff
reinforced
the
statement
but
without
avail
general
lee
shook
his
head
and
with
his
continued
to
gaze
toward
the
left
whence
should
arise
the
dust
the
smoke
the
sound
of
jackson
flanking
movement
there
was
no
sign
on
the
left
but
here
in
the
centre
the
noise
from
the
woods
beyond
the
creek
was
growing
infernal
he
lowered
the
glass
captain
chamberlayne
will
you
go
tell
general
longstreet
out
of
the
woods
back
from
creek
and
swamp
and
briar
and
slashing
from
abattis
of
bough
and
log
from
the
shadow
of
that
bluff
head
with
its
earthworks
one
above
the
other
from
the
scorching
flame
of
twenty
batteries
and
the
wild
singing
of
the
minies
rushed
the
south
carolina
troops
the
brigadier
maxey
gregg
the
regimental
the
company
officers
with
shouts
with
appeals
with
waved
swords
strove
to
stop
the
rout
the
command
rallied
then
broke
again
hell
was
in
the
wood
and
the
men
faces
were
grey
and
drawn
we
must
rally
those
troops
said
lee
and
galloped
forward
he
came
into
the
midst
of
the
disordered
throng
men
men
remember
your
state
do
your
duty
they
recognized
him
rallied
formed
on
the
colours
swept
past
him
with
a
cheer
and
reentered
the
deep
and
fatal
wood
the
battery
in
front
of
allan
began
to
suffer
dreadfully
the
horses
grew
infected
with
the
terror
of
the
plain
they
jerked
their
heads
back
they
neighed
mournfully
some
left
the
grass
and
began
to
gallop
aimlessly
across
the
field
the
shells
came
in
a
stream
great
hurtling
missiles
where
they
struck
flesh
or
ploughed
into
the
earth
it
was
with
a
deadened
sound
when
they
burst
in
air
it
was
like
crackling
thunder
the
blue
sky
was
gone
a
battle
pall
wrapped
the
thousands
and
thousands
of
men
the
guns
the
horses
forest
swamp
creeks
old
fields
the
great
strength
of
the
federal
position
the
grey
brigades
dashing
against
it
hurled
back
like
atlantic
combers
it
should
be
about
three
allan
thought
but
he
did
not
know
every
nerve
was
tingling
the
blood
pounding
in
his
veins
time
and
space
behaved
like
waves
charged
with
strange
driftwood
he
felt
a
mad
excitement
was
sure
that
if
he
stood
upright
or
tried
to
walk
he
would
stagger
an
order
ran
down
the
line
of
the
brigade
he
had
adopted
illustration
the
battle
he
found
himself
on
his
feet
and
in
line
steady
clear
of
head
as
though
he
trod
the
path
by
thunder
run
march
the
brigade
cleared
the
wood
and
in
line
of
battle
passed
the
exhausted
battery
allan
noted
a
soldier
beneath
a
horse
a
contorted
purple
frozen
face
held
between
the
brute
the
air
was
filled
with
whistling
shells
the
broom
sedge
was
on
fire
shoulder
shift
arms
charge
somewhere
about
halfway
over
the
plain
he
became
convinced
that
his
right
leg
from
the
hip
down
was
gone
to
sleep
he
had
an
idea
that
he
was
not
keeping
up
a
line
passed
him
another
he
must
let
the
others
get
ahead
and
for
a
minute
he
ran
quite
rapidly
there
was
a
yellow
gulley
before
him
the
charge
swept
down
one
side
and
up
the
other
this
crack
in
the
earth
was
two
thirds
of
the
way
across
the
open
beyond
were
the
wood
the
creek
the
abattis
the
climbing
lines
of
breastworks
the
thousand
in
blue
and
the
tremendous
guns
the
grey
charge
was
yelling
high
and
clear
preparing
to
deliver
its
first
fire
the
air
a
roar
of
sound
and
a
glaring
light
allan
went
down
one
side
of
the
gulley
with
some
ease
but
it
was
another
thing
to
climb
the
other
however
up
he
got
almost
to
the
top
and
then
pitched
forward
clutching
at
the
growth
of
sedge
along
the
crest
it
held
him
steady
and
he
settled
into
a
rut
of
yellow
earth
and
tried
to
think
it
over
endeavouring
to
draw
himself
a
little
higher
a
minie
ball
went
through
his
shoulder
the
grey
charge
passed
him
roaring
on
to
the
shadowy
wood
he
helped
himself
as
best
he
could
staunched
some
blood
drew
his
own
conclusions
as
to
his
wounds
he
was
not
suffering
much
not
over
much
by
nature
he
matched
increasing
danger
with
increasing
coolness
all
that
he
especially
wanted
was
for
that
charge
to
succeed
for
the
grey
to
succeed
his
position
here
on
the
rim
of
the
gully
was
an
admirable
one
for
witnessing
all
that
the
shifting
smoke
might
allow
to
be
witnessed
it
was
true
that
a
keening
minie
or
one
of
the
monstrous
shells
might
in
an
instant
shear
his
thread
of
life
probably
would
do
so
all
the
probabilities
lay
that
way
but
he
was
cool
and
courageous
and
had
kept
himself
ready
to
go
an
absorbing
interest
in
the
field
of
gaines
mill
a
passionate
desire
that
victory
should
wear
grey
dominated
all
other
feeling
half
in
the
seam
of
the
gully
half
in
the
sedge
at
the
top
he
made
himself
as
easy
as
he
could
and
rested
a
spectator
the
battle
smoke
now
heavily
settling
now
drifting
like
clouds
before
a
wind
now
torn
asunder
and
lifting
from
the
scene
made
the
great
field
to
come
and
go
in
flashes
or
like
visions
of
the
night
he
saw
that
hill
was
sending
in
his
brigades
brigade
after
brigade
he
looked
to
the
left
whence
should
come
jackson
but
over
there
just
seen
through
the
smoke
the
forest
stood
sultry
and
still
behind
him
however
in
the
wood
at
the
base
of
the
armed
hill
there
rose
a
clamour
and
deep
thunder
as
of
armageddon
like
a
grey
wave
broken
against
an
iron
shore
the
troops
with
whom
he
had
charged
streamed
back
disordered
out
of
the
shadowy
wood
into
the
open
where
in
the
gold
sedge
lay
many
a
dead
man
and
many
a
wounded
allan
saw
the
crimson
flag
with
the
blue
cross
shaken
held
on
high
heard
the
officers
crying
back
men
back
virginians
do
your
duty
the
wave
formed
again
he
tried
to
rise
so
that
he
might
go
with
it
but
could
not
it
returned
into
the
wood
before
him
racing
toward
the
gully
came
another
wave
branch
brigade
yelling
as
it
charged
he
saw
it
a
moment
like
a
grey
wall
with
the
colours
tossing
then
it
poured
down
into
the
gully
and
up
and
past
him
he
put
up
his
arms
to
shield
his
face
but
the
men
swerved
a
little
and
did
not
trample
him
the
worn
shoes
digging
into
the
loose
earth
covered
him
with
dust
the
moving
grey
cloth
the
smell
of
bodies
of
powder
of
leather
of
hot
metal
the
panting
breath
the
creak
and
swing
the
sudden
darkening
heat
and
pressure
the
passage
of
that
wave
took
his
own
breath
from
him
left
him
white
and
sick
branch
went
on
he
looked
across
the
gully
and
saw
another
wave
coming
pender
this
time
pender
came
without
yelling
grim
and
grey
and
pender
had
suffered
before
beaver
dam
creek
there
was
not
much
more
than
half
a
brigade
it
too
passed
a
determined
wave
allan
saw
field
in
the
distance
coming
up
he
was
tormented
with
thirst
three
yards
from
the
gully
lay
stretched
the
trunk
of
a
man
the
legs
blown
away
he
was
almost
sure
he
caught
the
glint
of
a
canteen
he
lay
flat
in
the
sedge
and
dragged
himself
to
the
corpse
there
was
the
canteen
indeed
marked
with
a
great
spoil
taken
perhaps
at
williamsburg
or
at
seven
pines
it
was
empty
drained
dry
as
a
bone
there
was
another
man
near
allan
dragged
himself
on
he
thought
this
one
dead
too
but
when
he
reached
him
he
opened
large
blue
eyes
and
breathed
water
allan
sorrowfully
shook
his
head
the
blue
eyes
did
not
wink
nor
close
they
glazed
and
stayed
open
the
scout
dropped
beside
the
body
exhausted
field
charge
passed
over
him
when
he
opened
his
eyes
this
portion
of
the
plain
was
like
a
sea
between
cross
winds
all
the
broken
waves
were
wildly
tossing
here
they
recoiled
fled
even
across
the
gully
here
they
seethed
inchoate
there
regathering
form
and
might
they
readvanced
to
the
echoing
hill
with
its
three
breastworks
and
its
eighty
cannon
death
gorged
himself
in
the
tangled
slashing
on
the
treacherous
banks
of
the
creek
hill
was
a
superb
fighter
he
sent
in
his
brigades
they
returned
broken
he
sent
them
in
again
they
went
the
and
north
carolina
passed
the
three
lines
of
blazing
rifles
got
to
the
head
of
the
cliff
found
themselves
among
the
guns
in
vain
artillerymen
morrell
infantry
pushed
them
back
and
down
down
the
hillside
back
into
the
slashing
the
georgia
launched
itself
like
a
thunderbolt
and
pierced
the
lines
but
it
too
was
hurled
down
gregg
south

regulars
locked
and
swayed
archer
and
pender
field
and
branch
charged
and
were
repelled
to
charge
again
save
in
marksmanship
the
confederate
batteries
could
not
match
the
federal
strength
was
with
the
great
blue
rifled
guns
and
yet
the
grey
cannoneers
wrought
havoc
on
the
plateau
and
amid
the
breastworks
the
sound
was
enormous
a
complex
tumult
that
crashed
and
echoed
in
the
head
the
whole
of
the
field
existed
in
the
throbbing
expanded
brain
all
battlefields
all
life
all
the
world
and
other
worlds
all
problems
solved
and
insoluble
the
grey
battlefront
was
now
convex
to
the
foe
the
rolling
dense
smoke
flushed
momently
with
a
lurid
glare
in
places
the
forest
was
afire
in
others
the
stubble
of
the
field
from
horn
to
horn
of
the
sickle
galloped
the
riderless
horses
now
and
again
a
wounded
one
among
them
screamed
fearfully
allan
dragged
himself
back
to
the
gully
it
was
safer
there
because
the
charging
lines
must
lessen
speed
break
ranks
a
little
they
would
not
be
so
resistlessly
borne
on
and
over
him
he
was
not
or
he
thought
he
was
not
he
lay
on
the
rim
of
the
gully
that
was
now
trampled
into
a
mere
trough
of
dust
and
he
looked
at
the
red
light
on
the
rolling
vapour
where
it
lifted
he
saw
as
in
a
pageant
war
in
sound
too
had
organized
he
could
have
beaten
time
to
the
gigantic
rhythm
it
rose
and
sank
it
was
made
up
of
groaning
shouting
breathing
of
men
gasping
and
the
sounds
that
horses
make
with
louder
and
louder
the
thunder
of
the
inanimate
the
congregated
sound
of
the
allies
man
had
devised
the
saltpetre
he
had
digged
the
powder
he
had
made
the
rifles
he
had
manufactured
the
cannon
he
had
moulded
the
solid
shot
grape
canister
shrapnel
minie
balls
the
shells
were
fearful
allan
was
fain
to
acknowledge
they
passed
like
whistling
winds
they
filled
the
air
like
great
rocks
from
a
blasting
the
staunchest
troops
blanched
a
little
jerked
the
head
sidewise
as
the
shells
burst
and
showered
ruin
there
came
into
allan
mind
a
picture
in
the
old
geography
rocks
thrown
up
by
vesuvius
he
thought
he
was
speaking
to
the
geography
class
i
show
you
how
they
look
i
was
lying
you
see
at
the
edge
of
the
crater
and
they
were
all
overhead
the
picture
passed
away
and
he
began
to
think
that
the
unearthly
shriek
was
much
like
the
winter
wind
round
thunder
run
mountain
sairy
and
tom
was
sairy
baking
gingerbread
of
course
not
they
did
have
gingerbread
now
besides
you
did
want
gingerbread
when
you
were
thirsty
water
water
water
water
tom
might
be
taking
the
toll
if
there
was
anybody
to
pay
it
and
if
they
kept
the
roads
up
roses
in
bloom
and
the
bees
in
them
and
over
the
pansies
the
wrens
sang
and
christianna
came
down
the
road
roses
and
pansies
with
their
funny
little
faces
and
sairy
blue
gingham
apron
and
the
blue
sky
the
on
the
porch
with
the
gourd
he
began
to
mutter
a
little
time
to
take
in
children
did
you
hear
the
bell
i
rang
it
loudly
i
am
ringing
it
now
listen
loud
loud
like
church
bells
and
cannons
the
old
lesson
curtius
and
the
gulf
in
the
next
onrush
a
man
stumbled
and
came
to
his
knees
beside
him
not
badly
hurt
he
was
about
to
rise
allan
caught
his
arm
for
sake
if
you
got
any
water
the
man
a
tall
alabamian
looked
down
nodded
jerked
loose
another
canteen
and
dropped
it
into
the
other
hand
all
right
all
right
not
at
all
not
at
all
he
ran
on
joining
the
hoar
and
shouting
wave
allan
the
flask
set
to
his
lips
found
not
water
but
a
little
cold
and
weak
coffee
it
was
nectar
it
was
happiness
it
was
life
though
he
could
have
drunk
ten
times
the
amount
the
cool
draught
and
the
strength
that
was
in
it
revived
him
drew
his
wandering
mind
back
from
thunder
run
to
gaines
mill
again
he
wished
to
know
where
was
the
army
of
the
valley
it
might
be
over
there
in
the
smoke
pall
turning
fitz
john
porter
right
but
he
did
not
believe
it
brigade
after
brigade
had
swept
past
him
had
been
broken
had
reformed
had
again
swept
by
into
the
wood
that
was
so
thick
with
the
dead
hill
continued
to
hurl
them
in
standing
magnificent
fighter
his
eyes
on
the
dark
and
bristling
stronghold
on
the
hill
behind
the
climbing
breastworks
and
the
iron
giants
atop
fitz
john
porter
good
and
skilful
soldier
withdrew
from
the
triple
lines
his
decimated
regiments
put
others
in
their
places
scoured
with
the
hail
of
his
batteries
the
plain
of
the
confederate
centre
all
the
attack
was
here
all
the
attack
was
here
and
the
grey
brigades
were
thinning
like
mist
wreaths
the
dead
and
wounded
choked
field
and
gully
and
wood
and
swamp
allan
struck
his
hands
together
what
had
happened
what
was
the
matter
how
long
had
he
lain
here
two
hours
at
the
least
and
always
it
was
hill
battle
and
always
the
grey
brigades
with
a
master
courage
dashed
themselves
against
the
slope
of
fire
and
always
the
guns
repelled
them
it
was
growing
late
the
sun
could
not
be
seen
plain
and
woods
were
darkening
darkening
and
filled
with
groaning
it
was
about
him
like
a
melancholy
wind
the
groaning
he
raised
himself
on
his
hands
and
saw
how
many
indeed
were
scattered
in
the
sedge
or
in
the
bottom
of
the
yellow
gully
or
slanted
along
its
sides
he
had
not
before
so
loudly
heard
the
complaining
that
they
made
and
for
a
moment
the
brain
wondered
why
then
he
was
aware
that
the
air
was
less
filled
with
missiles
that
the
long
musketry
rattle
and
the
baying
of
the
war
dogs
was
a
little
hushed
even
as
he
marked
this
the
lull
grew
more
and
more
perceptible
he
heard
the
moaning
of
the
wounded
because
now
the
ear
could
take
cognizance
the
shadow
deepened
a
horse
with
a
saddle
unhurt
himself
approached
him
stood
nickering
for
a
moment
then
again
lashed
out
with
his
heels
and
fled
all
the
plain
the
sedge
below
the
rolling
canopy
above
was
tinged
with
reddish
umber
the
sighing
wind
continued
but
the
noise
of
firing
died
and
died
for
all
the
moaning
of
the
wounded
there
seemed
to
fall
a
ghastly
silence
over
allan
came
a
feeling
as
of
a
pendulum
forever
stopped
as
of
time
but
a
wreck
on
the
shore
of
space
and
space
a
deserted
coast
an
experiment
of
some
power
who
found
it
ineffective
and
tossed
it
away
the
now
and
here
petrified
forever
desolate
forever
an
obscure
bubble
in
the
sea
of
being
a
faint
tracing
on
the
eternal
mind
to
be
overlaid
and
forgotten
here
it
rested
and
would
rest
the
field
would
stay
and
the
actors
would
stay
both
forever
as
they
were
standing
lying
in
motion
or
at
rest
suffering
thirsting
tasting
the
sulphur
and
feeling
the
heat
held
here
forever
in
a
vise
grey
shadows
suffering
like
substance
knowing
the
lost
battle
a
deadly
weakness
and
horror
came
over
him
o
god
let
us
die
from
the
rear
to
hill
right
where
was
longstreet
broke
a
faint
yelling
it
grew
clearer
came
nearer
from
another
direction
from
the
left
burst
a
like
sound
increasing
likewise
high
wild
and
clear
like
a
breath
over
the
field
went
the
conviction
jackson
at
last
allan
dropped
in
the
broom
sedge
his
arm
beneath
his
head
the
grey
sleeve
was
wet
with
tears
the
pendulum
was
swinging
he
was
home
in
the
dear
and
dread
world
the
sound
increased
the
earth
began
to
shake
with
the
tread
of
men
the
tremendous
guns
began
again
their
bellowing
longstreet
swung
into
action
with
the
brigades
of
kemper
anderson
pickett
willcox
pryor
and
featherstone
on
the
left
with
his
own
division
with
ewell
with

jackson
struck
at
last
like
jackson
whiting
with
two
brigades
should
have
been
with
jackson
but
missing
his
way
in
the
wood
came
instead
to
longstreet
and
with
him
entered
the
battle
the
day
was
descending
all
the
plain
was
smoky
or
luridly
lit
a
vast
shield
of
mars
with
war
in
action
with
longstreet
and
with
jackson
up
at
last
lee
put
forth
his
full
strength
fifty
thousand
men
in
grey
thousand
men
in

were
at
once
engaged
in
three
hundred
years
there
had
been
in
the
western
hemisphere
no
battle
so
heavy
as
this
one
the
artillery
jarred
even
the
distant
atmosphere
and
the
high
mounting
clouds
were
tinged
with
red
six
miles
away
richmond
listened
aghast
allan
forgot
his
wounds
forgot
his
thirst
forgot
the
terror
sick
and
cold
of
the
minute
past
he
no
longer
heard
the
groaning
the
storm
of
sound
swept
it
away
he
was
a
fighter
with
the
grey
all
his
soul
was
in
the
prayer
let
them
come
let
them
conquer
he
thought
the
war
bleed
and
the
mighty
he
saw
a
charge
approaching
willingly
would
he
have
been
stamped
into
the
earth
would
it
further
the
feet
on
their
way
the
grey
line
hung
an
instant
poised
on
the
further
rim
of
the
gully
then
swept
across
and
onward
until
the
men
were
by
him
it
was
thick
night
thick
and
stifling
they
passed
he
heard
the
yelling
as
they
charged
the
slope
the
prolonged
tremendous
rattle
of
musketry
the
shouts
the
foiled
assault
and
the
breaking
of
the
wave
another
came
a
wall
of
darkness
in
the
closing
day
over
it
hung
a
long
cloud
allan
prayed
aloud
o
god
of
battles
o
god
of
battles
the
wave
came
on
it
resolved
itself
into
a
moving
frieze
a
wide
battle
line
of
tall
men
led
by
a
tall
gaunt
general
with
blue
eyes
and
flowing
tawny
hair
in
front
was
the
red
ground
and
blue
cross
beside
it
dipped
and
rose
a
blue
flag
with
a
single
star
the
smoke
rolled
above
about
the
line
bursting
overhead
a
great
shell
lit
all
with
a
fiery
glare
the
frieze
began
to
sing
the
race
is
not
to
them
that
got
the
longest
legs
to
run
nor
the

that
people
that

down

up

he
did
not
care
he
had
a
vision
of
keen
bronze
faces
hands
on
the

him
with

in

concussion

conflagration

i

so
general
such
a

of

i
have
never

they

it

have
you

no
not

i
do

very
dark

not

what
that

i
do

mcclellan
may

have
you

out
yes
what
do
you

i
think
sir
the
rout
outweighs
the
reinforcements
i
think
we
should
press
on
at
once
if
we
had
cavalry
said
winder
impatiently
however
general
stuart
has
swept
down
toward
the
pamunkey
that
will
be
their
line
of
retreat
to
the

there
is
the
chance
said

that
general
mcclellan
will
abandon
that
line

make
instead
for
the
james

the

at

hill
nodded
yes
it
a
possibility
general
lee
is
aware
of
it
not
unmask
richmond
and
come
altogether
on

the

higher

i
do
not

sir
there

i
believe
that
the
grapevine
is
their
only
road
you
believe
colonel
but
you
do
not
know
what
do
you
think
general
winder
i
think
sir
with
colonel
cleave
that
we
should
push
down
through
the
woods
to
the
right
of
the
grapevine
bridge
they
too
are
exhausted
their

jaded
their

spent
we
could
gather
a

poague
battery
is

they
are
crushed

we
could

two

three

perhaps
be

when

on

now
a

all

just
the

the

shouting
brigades
and
our
centre
and
right
on
the
other
side
of
the
creek
i
do
dare
do
it
gentlemen
not
on
my
own
responsibility
what
do
you
think
general
lawton
i
think
you
are
right
sir
more
and
more
troops
are
coming
upon
the
plateau
said
winder
general
hill
if
you
will
order
us
to
go
we
will
see
to
it
that
you
do
not
repent
they
are
defeated
and
retreating
sir
said
cleave
if
they
are
crossing
the
river
it
is
at
least
in
the
realm
of
probability
that
they
have
but
the
one
path
no
one
knows
better
than
you
what
resolute
pressure
might
now
accomplish
every
moment
that
we
wait
they
gain
in
steadiness
and
other
reserves
will
come
up
make
their
junction
with
their
centre
and
we
fight
a
terrific
battle
where
a
lesser
struggle
might
secure
a
greater
victory
speaking
largely
that
is
true
said
hill
but
i
wish
general
jackson
were
here
i
think
you
know
gentlemen
that
personally
i
could
wish
at
this
minute
to
be
down
there
in
the
woods
beside
the
grapevine
bridge
but
with
the
knowledge
that
the
enemy
is
bringing
up
reserves
with
the
darkness
so
thick
with
no
great
force
and
that
exhausted
and
with
no
artillery
i
can
not
take
the
responsibility
of
the
advance
if
general
jackson
were
here
may
i
send
in
search
of
him
sir
yes
general
winder
you
may
do
that
and
if
he
says
there
one
of
you
be
happier
than
i
we
know
that
cleave
i
am
going
to
send
you
you
far
the
likeliest
we
want
him
to
come
and
lead
us
to
the
completest
victory
by
god
we
want
front
royal
and
port
republic
again
cleave
turning
disappeared
into
the
darkness
see
to
your
men
general
winder
get
them
ready
said
hill
i
going
a
little
way
into
the
woods
to
see
what
i
can
see
myself
he
went
lawton
with
him
before
many
minutes
had
passed
they
were
back
nearly
walked
into
their
lines
strung
across
the
grapevine
road
massed
thick
between
us
and
the
chickahominy
scattered
like
acorns
through
the
woods
pretty
miserable
i
gather
passed
party
hunting
water
speech
bewrayeth
the
man
so
did
say
anything
heard
the
pickets
talking
was
meagher
and
french
came
up
they
building
great
fires
by
the
water
looks
as
though
they
meant
to
cross
nothing
of
general
jackson
yet
no
sir
not
yet
well
i
going
into
the
house
for
a
morsel
of
food
send
for
me
the
moment
you
hear
anything
i
wish
the
artillery
were
up
who
this
colonel
fauquier
cary
in
the
darkness
could
tell
yes
general
winder
thinks
so
too
we
sent
to
ask
general
jackson
come
with
me
cary
to
the
house
faugh
this
stifling
heat
and
that
was
sykes
we
were
fighting
against
george
sykes
remember
he
was
my
roommate
at
the
point
the
short
path
to
mcgehee
house
was
not
trodden
without
difficulty
all
the
great
plateau
was
cumbered
with
debris
of
the
struggle
on
the
cut
and
furrowed
ground
one
stumbled
upon
abandoned
stores
and
arms
there
were
overturned
wagons
and
ambulances
with
dead
horses
there
were
ruined
there
were
wrecked
litters
fallen
tents
dead
men
and
the
wounded
here
and
on
the
plain
below
the
lanterns
of
the
surgeons
and
their
helpers
moved
like
glowworms
they
gathered
the
wounded
blue
and
grey
treat
the
whole
field
alike
had
said
lee
everywhere
were
troops
seeking
their
commands
hoarsely
calling
joining
at
last
their
comrades
fires
had
been
kindled
dim
dim
in
the
southwestern
sky
beyond
the
yet
rolling
vapour
showed
a
gleaming
where
was
richmond
hill
and
fauquier
cary
went
indoors
an
aide
managed
to
find
some
biscuits
and
there
was
water
from
the
well
i
touched
food
since
daybreak
said
the
general
nor
i
much
as
i
like
him
i
am
loath
to
let
fitz
john
porter
strike
down
the
york
river
line
if
that
his
road
or
cross
the
chickahominy
if
that
the
road
we
have
a
victory
press
it
home
and
fix
it
there
i
believe
that
you
are
right
surely
jackson
will
see
it
so
where
is
general
jackson
god
knows
thank
you
reid
poor
fare
cary
but
familiar
come
reid
get
your
share
they
ate
the
hard
biscuits
and
drank
the
the
air
was
still
and
sultry
through
the
windows
they
heard
afar
off
the
bugles
their
own
and
those
of
the
foe
high
over
all
the
melancholy
bugle
grieves
moths
came
in
to
the
candle
with
his
hand
cary
warned
them
away
one
lit
on
his
sleeve
i
wonder
what
you
think
of
it
he
said
and
put
him
out
of
window
there
was
a
stir
at
the
door
a
sergeant
appeared
gathering
up
the
wounded
general
and
we
found
a
yankee
officer
under
the
trees
just
here
and
he
said
you
know
him
but
he
fainted
dead
away
he
moved
aside
litters
gave
out
long
ago
so
we
taking
blankets
four
men
carrying
by
the
corners
a
blanket
with
an
unconscious
man
upon
it
came
into
the
room
the
confederate
officers
looked
no
i
know
him
why
wait
yes
i
do
it
clitz
clitz
that
was
so
young
and
and
our
pet
at
the
point
yes
and
one
day
in
mexico
his
regiment
filed
past
going
into
a
fight
and
he
looked
so
like
a
gallant
boy
that
i
prayed
to
god
that
clitz
might
not
be
hurt
reid
have
him
put
in
a
room
here
see
that
mott
sees
him
at
o
god
cary
this
fratricidal
war
fighting
george
sykes
all
day
and
now
this
boy
yes
said
cary
once
i
was
opposed
to
fitz
john
porter
he
looked
at
me
out
of
a
cloud
and
i
looked
at
him
out
of
one
and
the
battle
roared
between
i
always
liked
him
he
walked
across
the
room
looked
out
of
the
window
upon
the
battlefield
and
came
back
but
he
said
grimly
it
is
a
war
of
invasion
what
do
you
think
is
wrong
with
jackson
the
other
looked
at
him
with
his
fine
kindly
eyes
why
let
me
tell
you
cary
since
it
wo
go
any
further
i
am
as
good
a
presbyterian
as
he
is
but
i
think
he
has
prayed
too
much
i
see
said
cary
well
i
would
be
willing
to
put
up
a
petition
of
my
own
just
delay
delay
we
have
set
opportunity
against
a
wall
and
called
out
the
firing
party
he
rose
thanks
for
the
biscuits
i
feel
another
man
i
go
now
and
look
after
my
wounded
there
are
enough
of
them
poor
souls
another
stir
occurred
at
the
door
the
aide
appeared
they
taken
some
prisoners
in
the
wood
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
sir
one
of
them
says
he
general
reynolds
reynolds
good
god
reynolds
bring
him
in
general
reynolds
came
in
reynolds
hill
how
are
you
reynolds
good
lord
it
fauquier
cary
the
aide
put
a
chair
the
prisoner
sank
into
it
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
presently
he
let
them
drop
hill
we
ought
not
to
be
enemies
messmates
and
for
a
year
it
ghastly
i
agree
with
you
there
reynolds
it
ghastlier
than
you
are
hurt
outside
over
the
great
hilltop
upon
which
richard
cleave
was
moving
the
darkness
might
be
felt
the
air
smelled
strongly
of
burned
powder
was
yet
thickened
by
smoke
where
fires
had
been
kindled
the
ruddy
light
went
up
like
pillars
to
sustain
a
cloudy
roof
there
were
treetops
burnished
high
in
air
then
all
the
land
fell
to
the
swampy
shores
of
the
creek
and
beyond
to
the
vast
and
sombre
battle
plain
where
the
shells
had
rained
the
masses
of
grey
troops
upon
it
resting
on
their
arms
could
be
divined
by
the
red
points
of
lanterns
also
were
wandering
like
marsh
lights
up
and
down
and
to
and
fro
here
on
the
plateau
it
was
the
same
they
danced
like
giant
fireflies
he
passed
a
blazing
log
about
which
were
gathered
a
dozen
men
some
wag
of
the
mess
had
said
something
jocular
to
a
man
they
were
laughing
convulsively
had
they
been
blamed
they
would
perhaps
have
answered
that
it
was
better
to
laugh
than
to
cry
cleave
passed
them
with
no
inclination
to
blame
and
came
to
where
under
the
trees
the
was
gathered
here
too
there
were
fires
his
men
were
dropped
like
acorns
on
the
ground
making
a
little
coosh
frying
a
little
bacon
attending
to
slight
hurts
cognizant
of
the
missing
but
not
referring
to
them
loudly
glad
of
victory
burying
all
loss
with
a
wide
swing
of
courage
making
the
best
of
it
in
the
darkness
when
they
saw
cleave
they
suspended
all
other
operations
long
enough
to
cheer
him
he
smiled
waved
his
hand
spoke
a
short
word
to
hairston
breckinridge
and
hurried
on
he
passed
the
virginia
mourning
its
colonel
colonel
allen
fallen
in
the
front
of
the
charge
he
passed
other
bivouacs
men
of
rodes
of
garland
of
trimble
where
is
general
jackson
ca
tell
you
sir
here
is
general
ewell
old
dick
squatted
by
a
was
broiling
a
bit
of
bacon

on
one
side
as
he
looked
up
with
bright
round
eyes
at
cleave
whom
he
liked
that
you
richard
cleave
by
god
sir
if
i
were
as
excellent
a
as
i
am
a
cook

a
bit
well
we
wolloped
them
they
fought
like
men
and
we
fought
like
men
and
by
god
i
ca
get
the
cannon
out
of
my
ears
general
jackson
i
thought
he
was
in
front
with
hill
going
to
do
anything
more
it
pretty
late
but
i
ready
nothing
without
general
jackson
said
cleave
thank
you
general
if
i
might
have
a
mouthful
of
coffee
i
have
the
least
idea
when
i
have
eaten
ewell
handed
him
the
tin
cup
he
drank
hastily
and
went
on
now
it
was
by
a
field
hospital
ghastly
sights
and
ghastly
sounds
pine
boughs
set
for
torches
he
shut
his
eyes
in
a
moment
faintness
it
looked
a
demoniac
place
a
platform
in
some
inferno
circle
he
met
a
staff
officer
coming
up
from
the
plain
general
lee
has
ridden
to
the
right
he
is
watching
for
mcclellan
next

a
rumour

everything

it
true

dreadfully
kept
mcclellan
beautifully
general
jackson
on
the
slope
of
the
hill
by
the
breastworks
a
red
light
proclaimed
the
place
as
cleave
approached
it
it
seemed
a
solitary
flame
night
around
it
and
a
sweep
of
scarped
earth
cleave
coming
into
the
glow
found
only
the
old
negro
jim
squat
beside
it
like
a
gnome
his
eyes
upon
the
jewelled

cleave
descended
the
embankment
and
entered
a
heavy
wood
a
voice
spoke
jackson
very
curtly
who
is
it
and
what
is
your
business
it
is
the
colonel
of
the
virginia
sir
general
winder
sends
me
with
the
approval
of
general
hill
from
the
advance
by
the
mcgehee
house
a
part
of
the
shadow
detached
itself
and
came
forward
as
jackson
it
stalked
past
cleave
out
of
the
belt
of
trees
and
over
the
bare
red
earth
to
the
fire
the
other
man
followed
and
in
the
glare
faced
the
general
again
the
leaping
flame
showed
jackson
bronzed
face
with
the
brows
drawn
down
the
eyes
looking
inward
and
the
lips
closed
as
though
no
force
could
part
them
cleave
knew
the
look
and
inwardly
set
his
own
lips
at
last
the
other
spoke
well
sir
the
enemy
is
cramped
between
us
and
the
chickahominy
sir
our
pickets
are
almost
in
touch
of
theirs
if
we
are
scattered
and
disorganized
they
are
more
so
confused
distressed
we
are
the
victors
and
the
troops
still
feel
the
glow
of
victory
well
there
might
be
a
completer
victory
we
need
only
you
to
lead
us
sir
you
are
mistaken
the
men
are
wearied
they
worked
very
hard
in
the
valley
they
need
not
do
it
all
they
are
not
so
wearied
sir
there
is
comment
i
think
on
what
the
army
of
the
valley
has
not
done
in
the
last
two
days
we
have
our
chance
to
refute
it
all
general
lee
is
the
general
lee
will
give
orders
general
lee
has
said
to
himself
did
so
wonderfully
in
the
valley
i
do
not
doubt
he
will
do
as
wonderfully
here
i
leave
him
free
strike
when
it
is
time
it
is
time
now
sir
sir
you
are
forgetting
yourself
sir
i
wish
to
rouse
you
jackson
walked
past
the
fire
to
a
fallen
tree
sat
himself
down
and
looked
across
to
the
other
man
the
low
flame
more
deeply
bronzed
his
face
his
eyes
looked
preternaturally
sunken
he
sat
characteristically
rigid
a
figure
in
grey
stone
there
was
about
him
a
momentary
air
of
an
indian
he
looked
so
ruthless
if
it
was
not
that
thought
cleave
then
it
was
that
he
looked
fanatic
whichever
it
might
be
he
perceived
that
he
himself
stood
in
arctic
air
he
had
been
liked
he
knew
now
he
saw
the
mist
of
disfavour
rise
jackson
voice
came
gratingly
who
sent
you
general
winder
and
general
h
hill
you
will
tell
general
hill
that
i
shall
make
no
further
attack
i
have
other
important
duties
to
perform
i
know
what
i
risk
said
cleave
and
i
do
not
risk
it
lightly
have
you
thought
of
how
you
fell
on
them
at
front
royal
and
at
winchester
here
too
they
are
confused
retreating
a
greater
force
to
strike
a
greater
result
to
win
a
greater
service
to
do
for
the
country
a
greater
name
to
make
for
yourself
morning
all
the
world
may
say
struck
napoleon
napoleon
confidence
in
his
star
was
pagan
only
god
rules
and
the
man
who
accepts
opportunity
is
he
not
his
servant
may
we
not
sir
may
we
not
make
the
attack
no
sir
not
we
have
marred
too
many
sundays
it
is
not
sunday
jackson
looked
across
with
an
iron
countenance
so
little
the
fighter
knows
see
what
war
does
but
i
will
keep
in
part
at
least
the
sabbath
you
may
go
sir
general
jackson
this
is
friday
evening
colonel
cleave
did
you
hear
my
order
go
sir
and
think
yourself
fortunate
that
you
do
not
go
under
arrest
sir
sir
jackson
rose
one
other
word
and
i
take
your
sword
it
occurs
to
me
that
i
have
indulged
you
in
a
freedom
that
go
cleave
turned
with
sharp
precision
and
obeyed
three
paces
took
him
out
of
the
firelight
into
the
overhanging
shadow
he
made
a
gesture
of
sorrow
and
anger
who
says
that
magic
dead
now
how
long
will
that
potion
hold
him
he
stumbled
in
the
loose
bare
earth
swamp
and
creek
below
him
he
looked
down
into
that
trough
of
death
i
gained
nothing
and
i
have
done
for
myself
if
i
know
him
ugh
he
shook
himself
went
on
through
the
sultry
smoky
night
alternate
of
glare
and
darkness
to
the
eastern
face
of
the
plateau
here
he
found
winder
reported
and
with
him
encountered
hill
coming
with
fauquier
cary
from
the
mcgehee
house
what
that
said
hill
he
wo
pursue
very
well
that
settles
it
maybe
they
be
there
in
the
morning
maybe
not
look
here
winder
reynolds
taken
you
remember
reynolds
cary
and
cleave
had
a
moment
apart
all
well
fauquier
the
general
edward
i
think
so
i
saw
warwick
for
a
moment
a
minie
had
hurt
his
hand
not
serious
he
said
edward
i
have
not
seen
i
had
a
glimpse
of
him
this
this
morning
yes
long
ago
is
it
not
you
get
your
brigade
after
this
the
other
looked
at
him
oddly
will
i
i
strongly
doubt
it
well
it
seems
not
a
large
thing
beyond
the
main
battlefield
where
hill
and
shattered
brigades
lay
on
their
arms
beyond
the

waked
and
watched
beyond
the
chickahominy
and
its
swamps
beyond

and

lay
richmond
under

eastwardly
within

without

that
brilliant
and
histrionic

john

magruder
el
capitan
colorado
with
a
lisping
tongue
a

like
bayard
and
a

kept
general
mcclellan
under
the
impression
confirmed
by
the
whole
pinkerton
force
that
at

eighty
thousand

had
remained
to
guard
richmond
when
lee
with
at

eighty
thousand

had
crossed

richmond
knew
better
but
richmond
was
stoically
calm
as
to
the
possibility
of
a
storming
what
it
had
been
hard
to
be
calm
over
was
the
sound
this
friday
of
the
guns
beyond
the
chickahominy
mechanicsville
yesterday
was
bad
enough
but
this
was
frightful
heavy
continuous
it
took
away
the
breath
and
held
the
heart
in
an
iron
grip
all
the
loved
ones
there
all
the
loved
ones
there
and
heavier
and
heavier
toward
night
grew
the
fearful
sound
then
began
the
coming
of
the
wounded
in
the
long
dusk
of
the
summer
evening
the
cannonading
ceased
a
little
after
nine
arrived
couriers
announcing
the
victory
the
church
bells
of
richmond
not
yet
melted
into
cannon
began
to
ring
it
was
a
victory
it
was
a
victory
said
the
people
to
one
another
but
the
wounded
continued
to
come
in
ambulance
cart
and
wagon
rolling
like
tumbrels
over
the
stones
to
many
a
mother
was
brought
tidings
of
the
death
of
her
son
and
many
a
wife
must
say
i
am
widowed
and
many
children
cried
that
night
for
their
father
the
heat
was
frightful
the
city
tossed
and
moaned
without
sleep
or
nursed
or
watched
or
wandered
fevered
through
the
streets
the
noise
of
the
james
around
its
rocky
islands
was
like
the
groaning
of
the
distant
battlefield
the
odour
of
the
june
flowers
made
the
city
like
a
chamber
of
death
all
windows
were
open
wide
to
the
air
most
houses
lighted
sometimes
from
these
there
came
forth
a
sharp
cry
sometimes
forms
restless
in
the
night
searching
again
the
hospitals
he
might
be
here
he
might
be
at
this
one
sometimes
before
such
or
such
a

cart
or

at

the
night
before

gone
home
bathed
drawn
the
shutters
of
her
small
room
lain
down
and
resolutely
closed
her
eyes
she
must
sleep
she
knew
must
gather
strength
for
the
afternoon
and
night
the
house
was
quiet
last
night
the
eldest
son
had
been
brought
in
wounded
the
mother
her
cousin
had
him
in
her
chamber
she
and
his
mammy
and
the
old
family
doctor
his
sister
a
young
wife
was
possessed
by
the
idea
that
her
husband
might
be
in
one
of
the
hospitals
delirious
unable
to
tell
where
he
belonged
calling
upon
her
and
no
one
understanding
she
was
gone
in
the
feverish
heat
upon
her
search
there
came
no
sounds
from
below
after
the
thunder
which
had
been
in
the
ear
after
the
sounds
of
the
hospital
all
the
world
seemed
as
silent
as
a
cavern
or
as
the
depth
of
the
sea
judith
closed
her
eyes
determinedly
stilled
her
heart
drew
regular
breath
put
herself
out
of
richmond
back
in
a
certain
cool
and
green
forest
recess
which
she
loved
and
there
wooed
sleep
it
came
at
last
with
a
not
unhappy
dream
she
thought
she
was
walking
on
the
hills
back
of
greenwood
with
her
aunt
lucy
the
two
said
they
were
tired
and
would
rest
and
entered
the
graveyard
and
sat
down
upon
the
bank
of
ivy
beside
ludwell
cary
grave
that
was
all
natural
enough
a
thing
they
had
done
many
times
they
were
taught
at
greenwood
that
there
was
nothing
mournful
there
shells
lay
about
them
beneath
the
earth
but
the
beneficent
activities
had
escaped
and
were
active
still
beneficent
still
the
word
shells
in
the
dream
turned
the
page
she
was
upon
a
great
sea
beach
and
quite
alone
she
sat
and
looked
at
the
waves
coming
rolling
in
and
presently
one
laid
richard
at
her
feet
she
bandaged
the
cut
upon
his
forehead
and
called
him
by
his
name
and
he
looked
at
her
and
smiled
out
of
the
ocean
into
the
ocean
he
said
all
of
us
a
going
forth
and
a
returning
she
felt
herself
in
the
dream
in
his
arms
and
found
it
sweet
the
waves
were
beneath
them
they
lay
now
on
the
crests
now
in
the
hollows
and
there
seemed
no
port
this
endured
a
long
while
until
she
thought
she
heard
the
singing
then
there
came
a
booming
sound
and
she
thought
this
is
the
port
or
perhaps
it
is
an
island
that
we
are
passing
she
asked
richard
which
it
was
but
he
did
not
answer
and
she
turned
upon
the
wave
and
found
that
he
was
not
there
it
was
seaweed
about
her
arms
the
booming
grew
louder
rattled
the
she
opened
her
eyes
pushed
her
dark
loosened
hair
from
her
arms
and
bosom
and
sat
up
the
cannon
again
she
looked
at
her
watch
it
was
two
rising
she
put
on
her
dark
thin
muslin
and
took
her
shady
hat
the
room
seemed
to
throb
to
the
booming
guns
all
the
birds
had
flown
from
the
tulip
tree
outside
she
went
downstairs
and
tapped
at
her
cousin
door
how
is
he
conscious
now
thank
god
my
dear
the
doctor
says
he
will
be
spared
how
the
house
shakes
and
walter
and
ronald
out
there
you
are
going
back
yes
do
not
look
for
me
there
will
be
so
much
to
be
done
yes
yes
my
dear
louder
and
louder
and
ronald
is
so
reckless
you
must
have
something
to
eat
shirley
will
give
me
a
glass
of
milk
tell
rob
to
get
well
she
kissed
her
cousin
drank
her
glass
of
milk
in
the
where
the
silver
was
jingling
on
the
sideboard
and
went
out
into
the
hot
air
at
three
she
was
at
her
post
in
the
hospital
the
intermittent
thunder
heavier
than
any
on
the
continent
before
was
stilled
at
last
at
nine
as
had
happened
the
night
before
the
mazed
city
shook
the
mist
from
before
its
eyes
and
settled
to
the
hot
work
with
the
wagons
bringing
the
dead
and
the
wounded
dull
on
the
cobblestones
to
the
ear
but
loud
loud
to
the
heart
all
that
night
the
stonewall
hospital
was
a
grisly
place
by
the
next
morning
every
hospital
in
town
was
choked
with
the
wounded
and
few
houses
but
had
their
quota
the
surgeons
looked
like
wraiths
the
nursing
women
had
dark
rings
beneath
their
eyes
set
burningly
in
pale
faces
the
negroes
who
valiantly
helped
had
a
greyish
look
more
emotional
than
the
whites
they
burst
now
and
then
into
a
half
wail
half
chant
so
heavy
was
the
burden
so
inadequate
the
small
beleaguered
city
provision
for
the
weight
of
helpless
anguish
that
at
first
there
was
a
moment
of
paralysis
as
easy
to
strive
with
the
tornado
as
with
this
wind
of
pain
and
death
then
the
people
rallied
and
somewhat
outstripped
a
best
from
the
troops
immediately
about
the
city
came
the
funeral
escorts
all
day
the
dead
march
from
saul
wailed
through
the
streets
out
to
hollywood
the
churches
stayed
open
old
and
young
every
man
in
the
city
white
or
black
did
his
part
and
so
did
all
the
women
the
need
was
so
great
that
the
very
young
girls
heretofore
spared
found
place
now
in
hospital
or
house
beside
the
beds
the
pallets
the
mere
blanket
or
no
blanket
on
the
floor
they
could
keep
away
the
tormenting
flies
drawn
by
the
heat
the
glare
the
blood
and
effluvia
could
give
the
parched
lips
water
could
watch
by
the
less
terrifically
hurt
all
the
city
laboured
putting
aside
the
personal
anguish
the
private
loss
known
suspected
or
but
fearfully
dreaded
glad
of
the
victory
but
with
only
calamity
beneath
its
eyes
the
city
wrestled
with
crowding
pain
death
and
grief
margaret
cleave
was
at
one
of
the
great
hospitals
an
hour
later
came
too
miriam
and
christianna
yes
you
can
help
miriam
you
are
used
to
it
hold
this
bandage
so
until
the
doctor
comes
if
it
grows
like
this
one
call
some
one
at
once
christianna
you
are
mrs
preston
let
her
have
the
bucket
of
water
go
up
and
down
between
the
rows
and
give
water
to
those
who
want
it
if
they
can
not
lift
themselves
help
them
so
christianna
took
the
wooden
bucket
and
the
tin
dipper
for
all
she
looked
like
a
wild
rose
she
was
strong
and
she
had
a
certain
mountain
skill
and
light
certainty
of
movement
she
went
down
the
long
room
giving
water
to
all
who
moaned
for
it
they
lay
very
thick
the
wounded
side
by
side
in
the
heat
the
glare
of
the
room
where
all
the
light
possible
must
be
had
some
lay
outstretched
and
rigid
some
much
contorted
some
were
delirious
others
writhed
and
groaned
some
were
most
pathetically
silent
and
patient
nearly
all
were
thirsty
clutched
the
dipper
with
burning
fingers
drank
with
their
hollow
eyes
now
on
the
girl
who
held
it
now
on
mere
space
some
could
not
help
themselves
she
knelt
beside
these
raised
the
head
with
one
hand
put
water
to
the
lips
with
the
other
she
gained
her
mountain
steadiness
and
did
well
crooning
directions
in
her
calm
drawling
voice
this
bucket
emptied
she
found
where
to
fill
it
again
and
pursued
her
task
stepping
lightly
between
the
huddled
painful
rows
among
the
hurrying
forms
of
nurses
and
surgeons
and
coloured
helpers
at
the
very
end
of
the
long
lane
she
came
upon
a
blanket
spread
on
the
floor
on
it
lay
a
man
blond
and
straight
closed
eyes
with
a
line
between
them
hand
across
his
breast
touching
his
shirt
where
it
was
stiff
with
dried
blood
air
you
thirsty
began
christianna
then
set
the
bucket
suddenly
down
allan
opened
his
eyes
very
thirsty
i
reckon
i
am
not
on
thunder
run
am
i
the
frightful
day
wore
on
to
late
afternoon
no
guns
shook
the
air
in
these
hours
richmond
understood
that
out
beyond
the
entrenchments
there
was
a
pause
in
the
storm
mcclellan
was
leaving
his
own
wonderful
earthworks
but
would
he
retreat
down
the
peninsula
by
the
way
he
had
come
or
would
he
strike
across
and
down
the
james
to
his
gunboats
by
westover
the
city
gathered
that
general
lee
was
waiting
to
find
out
in
the
meantime
the
day
that
was
set
to
the
dead
march
in
saul
passed
somehow
in
the
june
heat
and
the
odour
of
flowers
and
blood
toward
five
judith
left
the
stonewall
hospital
she
had
not
quitted
it
for
hours
and
she
came
now
into
the
light
and
air
like
a
form
emerging
from
hades
very
palely
smiling
with
the
grey
of
the
underworld
its
breath
and
its
terror
still
about
her
there
was
hardly
yet
a
consciousness
of
fatigue
twelve
hours
before
she
had
thought
if
i
do
not
rest
a
little
i
shall
fall
but
she
had
not
been
able
to
rest
and
the
feeling
had
died
for
the
last
twelve
she
had
moved
like
an
automaton
swift
sure
without
a
thought
of
herself
it
was
as
though
her
will
stood
somewhere
far
above
and
swayed
her
body
like
a
wand
even
now
she
was
going
home
because
the
will
said
she
must
must
rest
two
hours
and
come
back
fresher
for
the
night
as
she
came
out
into
the
golden
light
cleave
left
the
group
of
young
and
old
about
the
door
and
met
her
in
the
plane
along
which
life
now
moved
nothing
was
unnatural
certainly
richmond
did
not
find
it
so
that
a
lover
and
his
beloved
should
thus
encounter
in
the
street
a
moment
between
battles
her
dark
eyes
and
his
grey
ones
met
to
find
him
there
seemed
as
natural
as
it
had
been
in
her
dream
the
street
was
no
more
to
her
than
the
lonely
beach
they
crossed
it
went
up
toward
the
capitol
square
and
entering
found
a
green
dip
of
earth
with
a
bench
beneath
a
linden
tree
behind
them
rose
the
terraced
slope
to
the
pillared
capitol
as
always
in
this
square
children
voices
were
heard
with
their
answering
nurses
and
the
squirrels
ran
along
the
grass
or
upon
the
boughs
above
but
the
voices
were
somewhat
distant
and
the
squirrels
did
not
disturb
it
was
a
leafy
quiet
nook
the
few
men
or
women
who
passed
pale
distrait
hurrying
from
one
quarter
of
the
city
to
another
heeded
as
little
as
they
were
heeded
meetings
lovers
partings
soldiers
women
who
loved
them
faces
pale
and
grave
yet
raised
hands
in
hands
low
voices
in
leafy
places
man
and
woman
together
in
the
golden
light
in
the
breathing
space
before
the
cannon
should
begin
again
richmond
was
growing
used
to
that
all
life
was
now
in
public
for
the
most
part
a
clear
altruism
swayed
the
place
and
time
and
in
the
glow
smallness
of
comment
or
of
thought
was
drowned
certainly
it
mattered
not
to
cleave
and
judith
that
it
was
the
capitol
square
and
that
people
went
up
and
down
i
have
but
the
shortest
while
he
said
i
came
this
morning
with
allen
body
the
colonel
of
the
i
ride
back
directly
i
hope
that
we
will
move
following
mcclellan
to
get
across
his
path
if
possible
there
will
be
another
battle
yes
more
than
one
perhaps
i
have
believed
that
you
were
safe
i
do
not
see
that
i
could
have
lived
else
many
have
fallen
many
are
hurt
i
found
allan
gold
in
the
hospital
he
will
not
die
however
judith
how
often
do
i
see
your
face
beside
the
flag
when
i
was
asleep
i
dreamed
of
you
we
were
drifting
together
far
out
at
sea
your
arm
here
she
lifted
his
hand
drew
his
arm
about
her
rested
her
head
on
his
breast
i
love
you
i
love
you
i
love
you
they
stayed
in
the
leafy
place
and
the
light
for
half
an
hour
speaking
little
sitting
sometimes
with
closed
eyes
but
hand
in
hand
it
was
much
as
though
they
were
drifting
together
at
sea
understanding
perfectly
but
weary
from
battling
and
with
great
issues
towering
to
the
inner
vision
they
would
have
been
less
nobly
minded
had
their
own
passion
inexorably
claimed
them
all
about
them
were
suffering
and
death
and
the
peril
of
their
cause
for
one
they
drew
happiness
from
the
darkly
gigantic
background
but
it
was
a
quiet
and
lofty
form
though
sweet
sweet
with
whom
they
companioned
when
the
time
was
passed
the
two
rose
and
cleave
held
her
in
his
arms
love
love
when
he
was
gone
she
waited
awhile
beneath
the
trees
then
slowly
crossed
the
capitol
square
and
moved
toward
the
small
room
behind
the
tulip
tree
the
streets
were
flooded
with
a
sunset
glow
into
franklin
from
main
came
marching
feet
then
dull
dull
the
muffled
drums
soldiers
and
furled
colours
and
the
coffin
atop
it
the
dead
man
cap
and
gauntlets
and
sword
behind
pacing
slowly
his
war
horse
stirrups
crossed
over
saddle
soldiers
soldiers
and
the
drums
beating
like
breaking
hearts
she
moved
back
to
a
doorstep
and
let
the
dead
march
from
saul
go
by
chapter
xxxiv
the
railroad
gun
the
troops
moving
at
dawn
to
the
chickahominy
over
a
road
and
through

fitz
john

and
the

corps
were
across
somewhere
between
the
river
and
savage
station
leaving
only
in
the
thick
wood
above
the
stream
a
party
of
sharpshooters
and
a
battery
when
the
grey
pioneers
advanced
to
their
work
these
opened
fire
the
bridge
must
be
rebuilt
and
the
grey
worked
on

with
delays
and
difficulties
hill
leading

brought
up
two
batteries
and
shelled
the
opposite
side
the
blue
guns
and
riflemen
moved
to
another
position
and
continued
at
short
intervals
to
fire
on
the
pioneers
it
was
sunday
the
fearfully
hot
by
the
mcgehee
house
and
on
turkey
hill
and
in
the
dense
midsummer
woods
and
in
the
bogs
and
swamps
through
which
meandered
the
chickahominy
the
river
spread
out
as
many
arms
as
briareus
short
stubby
creeks
slow
waters
prone
to
overflow
and
creep
between
high
knotted
roots
of
and
cypress
into
thickets
of
bog
myrtle
the
soil
hereabouts
was
black
and
wet

troops
drew
the
most
uncomplimentary
comparisons
to
a
man
they
preferred
mountains
firm
rolling
champaign
clean
rivers
with
rocky
bottoms
sound
roads
and
a
different
vegetation
they
were
not
in
a
good
humour
anyhow
ewell

at
dispatch
station
seven
miles
below

and
tearing
up
the

river
railroad
stuart
was
before
him
sweeping
down
on
the
white
house
burning
mcclellan
stations
and
stores
making
that
line
of
retreat
difficult
enough
for
an
encumbered
army
but
mcclellan
had
definitely
abandoned
any
idea
of
return
upon
yorktown
the
head
of
his
column
was
set
for
the
james
for
landing
and
the
gunboats
there
were
difficult
miles
to
go
he
had
something
like
a
hundred
thousand
men
he
had
five
thousand
wagons
heavy
artillery
trains
enormous
stores
a
rabble
of
camp
followers
a
vast
melancholy
freight
of
sick
and
wounded
he
left
his
camps
and
burned
his
depots
and
plunged
into
the
heavy
still
and
torrid
forest
this
sunday
morning
the
the
entrenchments
before
richmond
skilful
elaborate
pieces
of
engineering
were
found
by
magruder
and
huger
scouts
deserted
by
all
but
the
dead
and
a
few
score
of
sick
and
wounded
too
far
gone
to
be
moved
later
columns
of
smoke
rising
from
various
quarters
of
the
forest
betrayed
other
burning
camps
or
depots
this
was
followed
by
tidings
which
served
to
make
his
destination
certain
he
was
striking
down
toward
white
oak
swamp
there
the
defeated
right
coming
from
the
chickahominy
would
join
him
and
the
entire
great
force
move
toward

passed
behind
magruder
and
took
the
darbytown
road
a
courier
dispatched
to
ewell
ordered
him
to
rejoin
jackson
the
latter
was
directed
to
cross
the
chickahominy
with
all
his
force
by
the
grapevine
bridge
and
to
pursue
with
eagerness
he
had
the
directest
shortest
road
immediately
before
him
the
corps
which
had
been
defeated
at
gaines
mill
with
hill
with
whiting
and
lawton
he
had
now
fourteen
brigades
say
twenty
thousand
men
the
hours
passed
in
languid
sunshine
on
the
north
bank
of
the
chickahominy
the
troops
were
under
arms
but
the
bridge
was
not
finished
the
smoke
and
sound
of
the
rival
batteries
the
crack
of
the
hidden
rifles
on
the
southern
side
concerned
only
those
immediately
at
issue
and
the
doggedly
working
pioneers
mere
casual
cannonading
amusement
of
sharpshooters
no
longer
possessed
the
slightest
tang
of
novelty
where
the
operation
was
petty
and
a
man
in
no
extreme
personal
danger
he
could
not
be
expected
to
be
much
interested
the
troops
yawned
some
of
the
men
slept
others
fretted
why
ca
we
swim
the
damned
old
trough
they
get
away
thank
the
lord
i
was
born
in
tidewater
virginia
oh
i
like
to
see
the
shenandoah
the
virginia
occupied
a
rise
of
sandy
ground
covered
with
hazel
bushes
company
a
had
the
brink
of
it
looking
out
toward
the
enormously
tall
trees
towering
erect
from
the
river
margin
of
swamp
the
hazel
bushes
gave
little
shade
and
kept
off
the
air
the
blue
above
was
intense
the
buzzards
sailing
muskets
were
stacked
the
men
sprawling
at
ease
a
private
who
at
home
was
a
sunday
school
superintendent
read
his
bible
another
a
lawyer
tickled
a
hop
toad
with
a
spear
of
grass
another
a
blacksmith
rebound
the
injured
ankle
of
a
schoolboy
some
slept
snoring
in
the
scanty
shade
some
compared
diaries
or
related
scrappily
enough
battle
experiences
yes
and
robinson
was
scouting
and
he
was
close
to
garland
line
and
gosh
he
said
it
was
short
enough
and
garland
rode
along
it
and
he
said
said
he
you
are
not
many
but
you
are
a
noble
few
some
listened
to
the
booming
of
the
sparring
batteries
two
or
three
who
had
lost
close
friends
or
kinsmen
moped
aside
the
frank
sympathy
of
all
for
these
made
itself
apparent
the
shadiest
hazel
bushes
unobtrusively
came
into
their
possession
there
was
an
evident
intention
of
seeing
that
they
got
the
best
fare
when
dinner
was
called
a
collection
of
tobacco
had
been
taken
and
quietly
pushed
their
way
some
examined
knapsack
and
haversacks
good
oilcloths
belts
rolled
blankets
canteens
and
cartridges
picked
up
upon
the
road
others
seriously
did
incline
to
search
for
certain
intruders
along
the
seams
of
shirt
and
trousers
others
merely
lay
on
their
backs
and
looked
up
into
heaven
billy
maydew
was
one
of
these
and
steve
dagg
overturned
the
contents
of
a
knapsack
it
was
well
filled
but
with
things
steve
did
not
want
o
gawd
picters
and
pincushions
and
testaments
with
united

flags
in
them

sergeant
coffin
turned
from
contemplation
of
a
bursting

above
the
grapevine
crossing
if
anybody

a
chorus
arose

a
dozen
pesky
yankee
parrotts
the
gentle
zephyrs
speak
of
thee
and
so
does
the
hot
simoom
that
blows
from
chickahominy
bringing
an
inordinate
number
of
mosquitoes
i
behold
thy
sinuous
grace
in
the
curls
of
smoke
from
reilly
battery
and
also
in
the
slide
and
swoop
of
black
buzzards
over
a
multitude
of
dead
horses
in
the
woods
darling
chloe
we
are
stranded
on
an
ant
heap
which
down
here
they
call
a
hill
and
why
in
hell
we
do
swim
the
river
is
more
than
at
the
moment
i
can
tell
you
it
rumoured
that
old
jack
attending
church
in
the
neighbourhood
but
we
are
left
outside
to
praise
god
from
whom
all
blessings
flow
darling
chloe
this
company
is
not
so
unpopular
with
me
as
once
it
was
war
is
teaching
it
a
damned
lot
good
temper
and
pretty
ways
and
what
not
it
is
teaching
it
who
says
it
is
not
darling
chloe
if
you
could
see
how
long
and
lean
and
brown
we
are
and
how
ragged
we
are
and
how
lousy
of
course
of
course
sergeant
you
not
only
the
high
private
in

rear
rank

one
of
those
damned
crows
down
there
and
sail
over
these
damned
flats
and

feet
in
country
beyond

mountains

more
use

a
bombproof
than
we
have
i
ca
retract
handsomer
than
that
darling
chloe
the
company
grown
amiable
but
it
do
think
much
so
far
of
its
part
in
this
campaign
heretofore
in
tableaux
and
amateur
theatricals
it
has
had
a
star
role
and
in
this
damned
richmond
play
it
nothing
but
a
walking
shadow
darling
chloe
we
want
somebody
to
whoop
things
up
we
demand
the
centre
of
the
stage
it
was
so
hot
on
the
little
sandy
hill
that
there
was
much
straggling
down
through
the
woods
to
some
one
of
the
mesh
of
the
men
nearest
steve
were
all
turned
toward
the
discourser
to
chloe
who
sat
on
a
lift
of
sand
like
an
eastern
scribe
mathew
coffin
near
him
looked
half
pleased
half
sulky
at
the
teasing
since
port
republic
he
was
a
officer
billy
maydew
again
flat
on
his
back
stared
at
the
blue
sky
steve
stole
a
tin
cup
and
slipped
quietly
off
through
the
hazel
bushes
he
found
a
muddy
runlet
straying
off
from
the
river
and
quenched
his
thirst
then
turning
surveyed
through
the
trees
the
hump
of
earth
he
had
left
and
the
company
upon
it
beyond
it
were
other
companies
the
regiment
the
brigade
out
there
it
was
hot
and
glaring
in
here
there
was
black
cool
miry
loam
shade
and
water
steve
was
a
sybarite
born
and
he
lingered
here
he
did
mean
to
straggle
for
he
was
afraid
of
this
country
and
afraid
now
of
his
colonel
he
merely
lingered
and
roamed
about
a
little
beneath
the
immensely
tall
trees
and
in
the
thick
undergrowth
in
doing
this
he
presently
came
over
quaking
soil
and
between
the
knees
of
cypresses
flush
with
the
chickahominy
itself
he
sat
down
took
his
own
knees
in
his
arms
and
looked
at
it
it
was
not
so
wide
but
it
looked
stiller
than
the
sky
and
bottomless
the
banks
were
so
low
that
the
least
rain
lifted
it
over
it
strayed
now
here
and
there
between
tree
roots
there
was
no
such
word
as
sinister
in
steve
vocabulary
he
only
said
gawd
i
would
live
here
for
choice
the
country
across
the
stream
engaged
his
attention
seen
from
this
bank
it
appeared
all
forest
clad
but
where
his
own
existence
from
moment
to
moment
was
in
question
steve
could
read
the
signboards
as
well
as
another
certain
distant
southward
moving
yellowish
streaks
he
pronounced
dust
clouds
there
were
roads
beneath
and
moving
troops
and
wagon
trains
he
counted
four
columns
of
smoke
of
varying
thickness
the
heavier
meant
a
cluster
of
buildings
holding
stores
probably
the
thinner
some
farmhouse
or
barn
or
mill
from
other
signs
he
divined
that
there
were
clearings
over
there
and
that
the
blue
troops
were
burning
hayricks
and
fences
as
well
as
buildings
sound
too
it
seemed
deathly
still
here
on
the
brim
of
this
dead
water
and
yet
there
was
sound
the
batteries
of
course
down
the
stream
where
they
built
the
bridge
but
also
a
dull
low
dreary
murmur
from
across
from
the
thick
forest
and
the
lost
roads
and
the
swamps
through
which
guns
were
dragged
from
the
clearings
the
corn
and
wheat
fields
the
burning
depots
and
encampments
and
houses
of
the
people
the
sound
of
a
hostile
army
rising
from
the
country
where
two
months
before
it
had
settled
all
was
blended
there
came
simply
a
whirring
murmur
out
of
the
forest
beyond
the
chickahominy
steve
rose
yawned
and
began
again
to
prowl
every
rood
of
this
region
had
been
in
possession
of
that
humming
army
over
there
all
manner
of
desirable
articles
were
being
picked
up
orders
were
strict
weapons
even
injured
weapons
ammunition
even
ammunition
ramrods
bayonets
belts
all
these
must
be
turned
in
to
the
field
ordnance
officer
the
south
gleaned
her
battlefields
of
every
ounce
of
lead
or
iron
every
weapon
or
part
of
a
weapon
every
manufactured
article
of
war
this
done
the
men
might
appropriate
or
themselves
distribute
apparel
food
or
other
matters
steve
wandering
now
his
eyes
on
earth
saw
nothing
the
black
wet
soil
the
gnarled
roots
the
gloomy
meanders
of
the
stream
looked
terribly
lonely
gawd
even
the
do
come
here
thought
steve
and
on
his
way
back
to
the
hill
entered
a
thicket
of
low
bushes
with
shiny
green
leaves
here
he
all
but
stumbled
over
a
dead
soldier
in
a
blue
uniform
he
lay
on
his
face
arms
out
hands
clutching
at
some
grass
his
rifle
was
beside
him
haversack
all
undisturbed
picket
said
steve
o
gawd
ai
war
glorious
not
at
all
without
imagination
he
had
no
fondness
for
touching
dead
men
but
there
were
several
things
about
this
one
that
he
wanted
he
saw
that
the
shoes
would
fit
and
so
he
left
them
alone
his
own
rifle
was
back
there
stacked
with
the
others
on
the
hot
hillside
and
he
had
no
intention
of
bothering
with
this
one
if
the
ordnance
officer
wanted
it
let
him
come
himself
and
get
it
he
exchanged
and
took
the
other
rolled
oilcloth
and
then
he
looked
into
the
haversack
rising
to
his
feet
he
glanced
about
him
with
quick
furtive
motions
of
his
head
cool
shade
stillness
a
creepy
loneliness
taking
the
haversack
he
left
the
thicket
and
went
back
to
the
brink
of
chickahominy
here
he
sat
down
between
the
cypress
knees
and
drew
out
of
the
haversack
the
prize
of
prizes
it
fixed
a
grin
upon
his
lean
narrow
face
the
sight
and
smell
of
it
the
black
squat
bottle
he
held
it
up
to
the
light
it
was
three
quarters
full
the
cork
came
out
easily
he
put
it
to
his
lips
and
drank
gawd
it
ai
so
damned
lonely
after
all
the
sun
climbed
to
the
meridian
the
pioneers
wrought
as
best
they
might
on
the
grapevine
bridge
the
blue
battery
and
the
blue
sharpshooters
persisted
in
their
hindering
and
the
grey
battery
continued
to
interfere
with
the
blue
in
the
woods
and
over
the
low
hills
back
of
the
chickahominy
the
grey
brigades
of
stonewall
jackson
rested
impatiently
wondering
staring
at
the
river
staring
at
the
smoke
of
conflagrations
on
the
other
side
and
the
dust
streaks
moving
southward
down
on
the
swampy
bank
squat
between
the
cypress
knees
steve
drank
again
and
then
again
in
fact
emptied
the
squat
black
bottle
the
stuff
filled
him
with
a
tremendous
courage
and
conferred
upon
him
great
fluency
of
thought
he
waxed
eloquent
to
the
cypress
roots
upon
the
conduct
of
the
war
gawd
if
they
listen
ter
me
i
te
tell
them
how
bui
build
a
bridge
for
the
whole
rotten
army
to
cross
on
ef
it
broke
i
bui
build
another
yah
they
do
a
man
when
they
see
him
gawd
they
damn
slow
and
ai
a
man
over
here
got
anything
to
drink
it
all
over
there
he
wept
a
little
o
gawd
make
them
hurry
up
so
i
kin
git
across
he
put
the
bottle
to
his
lips
and
jerked
his
head
far
back
but
there
was
not
a
drop
left
to
trickle
forth
he
flung
it
savagely
far
out
into
the
water
ef
i
thought
there
was
another
like
you
over
there
his
courage
continued
to
mount
as
he
went
further
from
himself
he
stood
up
and
felt
a
giant
stretched
out
his
arm
and
admired
the
muscle
kicked
a
clod
of
black
earth
into
the
stream
and
rejoiced
in
the
swing
of
his
leg
then
he
smiled
a
grin
wrinkling
the
cheek
to
the
ear
then
he
took
off
his
grey
jacket
letting
it
drop
upon
the
cypress
roots
then
he
waded
into
the
chickahominy
and
began
to
swim
to
the
further
shore
the
stream
was
deep
but
not
swift
he
was
lank
and
lean
but
strong
and
there
was
on
the
other
side
a
pied
piper
piping
of
bestial
sweetnesses
several
times
arms
and
legs
refused
to
cooperate
and
there
was
some
likelihood
of
a
death
by
drowning
but
each
time
instinct
asserted
herself
righted
matters
and
on
he
went
she
pulled
him
out
at
last
on
the
southern
bank
and
he
lay
gasping
among
the
tree
roots
somewhat
sobered
by
the
drenching
but
still
on
the
whole
a
courageous
giant
he
triumphed
yah
i
got
across
goo
ye
darned
fools
squattin
on
the
hillside
he
left
the
chickahominy
and
moved
through
the
woods
he
went
quite
at
random
and
with
a
peculiar
gait
his
eyes
on
the
ground
looking
for
another
haversack
but
just
hereabouts
there
showed
nothing
of
the
kind
it
was
a
solemn
wood
of
pines
and
cedars
not
overtrampled
as
yet
by
war
steve
shivered
found
a
small
opening
where
the
sun
streamed
in
planted
himself
in
the
middle
of
the
warmth
and
presently
toppled
over
on
the
pine
needles
and
went
to
sleep
he
slept
an
hour
or
more
when
he
was
waked
by
a
party
of
officers
riding
through
the
wood
they
stopped
steve
sat
up
and
blinked
the
foremost
a
florid
magnificently
soldierly
personage
wearing
a
very
fine
grey
uniform

the
unlucky
steve
forward
march
dhirty
desartin
crayture
that
ye
be
thrott
beyond
the
pine
wood
the
two
came
into
an
area
which
had
been
overtrampled
indescribably
dreary
under
the
hot
sun
looked
the
smouldering
heaps
and
mounds
of
foodstuffs
the
wrecked
wagons
the
abandoned
picks
and
spades
and
shovels
the
smashed
camp
equipage
broken
kettles
pots
and
pans
the
blankets
bedding
overcoats
torn
and
trampled
in
the
mire
or
piled
together
and
a
dull
red
fire
slow
creeping
through
the
mass
had
been
split
by
a
blow
of
the
axe
the
vials
shivered
and
a
black
mire
made
by
the
liquids
ruined
weapons
glinted
in
the
sun
between
the
furrows
of
a
ruined
cornfield
bags
of
powder
boxes
of
cartridges
great
chests
of
shot
and
shell
showed
half
submerged
in
a
tortuous
creek
at
the
edge
of
the
field
there
was
a
cannon
spiked
and
overturned
here
too
were
dead
horses
and
here
too
were
the
black
birds
there
was
a
trench
as
well
a
long
trench
just
filled
with
two
or
three
little
head
boards
bearing
some
legend
holy
virgin
said
the
courier
if
i
was
a
horse
a
child
or
a

hathred
steve

i
will
you

along
out
of
this
plundering
mess
ordered
the
courier
thinking
i
drop
you
soon
but
it
wo
be
just
here
step
lively
now
the
two
went
on
through
the
blazing
afternoon
sunshine
and
in
a
straggling
wood
came
upon
a
deserted
field
hospital
it
was
a
ghastly
place
the
courier
whistled
reflectively
while
the
imaginative
steve
felt
a
sudden
sinking
at
the
pit
of
the
stomach
together
with
a
cold
dizziness
and
perspiration
on
the
backs
of
his
hands
the
mind
of
the
courier
striking
out
vigorously
for
some
kind
of
a
stimulant
laid
hold
of
anger
as
the
nearest
efficient
bedad
he
cried
ye
desartin
dhirty
hound
it
right
here
i
be
afther
lavin

with
the
naked
dead
and
the
piles
of

and
legs

of
my
bridle
or
i
strike
you
with
my
pistol
butt
ughrrrrr
get
out
of
this
peggy
they
left
mare
and
man
in
a
cloud
of
pine
needles
and
parched
earth
steve
uttered
something
like
a
howl
and
went
too
running
without
regard
to
an
in
truth
not
mythical
sore
foot
he
ran
after
the
disappearing
courier
and
when
presently
he
reached
a
vast
patch
of
whitened
raspberry
bushes
giving
on
a
not
wide
and
very
dusty
road
and
halted
panting
it
was
settled
forever
that
he
could
go
back
to
the
plundering
possibilities
or
to
his
original
station
by
the
chickahominy
since
to
do
so
would
be
to
pass
again
the
abandoned
field
hospital
he
kept
his
face
turned
from
the
river
and
somewhat
to
the
east
and
straggled
on
a
signpost
told
him
that
the
dusty
ribbon
was
the
road
presently
among
the
berry
bushes
he
came
upon
a
grey
artilleryman
sitting
winding
a
strip
of
cloth
around
a
wound
in
his
leg
the
artilleryman
gave
him
further
information
magruder
moving
this
way
i
was
ahead
with
my
battery
griffith
brigade
and
some
stinking
sharpshooters
sitting
with
the
buzzards
in
the
trees
let
fly
at
us
result
i
got
to
hobble
in
at
the
end
of
the
parade
what
the
matter
with
you
captain
said
steve
asked
for
a
volunteer
to
swim
the
river
on
the
other
side
and
find
out
the
currents
i
swam
it
and
gawd
jest
then
a
yankee
battery
opened
and
i
could
get
back
be
over
after
awhile
i
reckon
the
two
sat
down
among
the
berry
bushes
the
road
was
visible
and
upon
it
a
great
approaching
pillar
of
dust
head
of
our
column
said
the
artilleryman
four
roads
and
four
pursuing
forces
and
if
we
can
only
all
strike
mac
at
once
there
be
a
battle
that
lay
over
friday
and
if
he
gets
to
his
gunboats
at
all
it
will
be
in
a
damaged
condition
magruder
bearing
toward
savage
station
and
if
jackson
across
the
chickahominy
we
might
do
for
fitz
john
porter
eh
we
might
agreed
steve
i
lie
a
little
flatter
because
the
sun
and
the
wetting
has
made
my
head
ache
they
fine
troops
the
grey
regiments
went
by
long
swinging
tread
and
jingling
accoutrements
a
riding
at
the
head
of
the
column
had
the
air
of
a
roman
consul
round
strong
bullet
head
which
he
had
bared
to
the
breeze
that
was
springing
up
black
hair
short
black
beard
high
nose
bold
eyes
a
red
in
his
cheeks
general
lafayette
mclaws
volunteered
the
artilleryman
that
general
kershaw
with
him
it
kershaw
brigade
see
the
palmetto
on
the
flags
kershaw
went
by
behind

another
high
and
thick
dust
cloud
cobb
and
toombs
and
barksdale
and
kemper
and
semmes
said
the
artilleryman
suppose
we
canter
on
i
break
a
staff
from
those
little
heaven
trees
there
we
might
get
to
see
the
show
after
all
york
river
just
over
there
they
went
on
first
to
the
ailanthus
bushes
then
leaving
the
road
to
the
troops
they
struck
across
a
ruined
cornfield
stalk
and
blade
and
tassel
and
the
intertwining
small
all
were
down
horses
hoofs
feet
of
men
had
made
of
naught
the
sower
pains
the
rail
fence
all
around
was
burning
in
a
furrow
the
two
found
a
knapsack
and
in
it
biscuit
and
jerked
beef
my
aunt
eliza
i
was
hungry
said
the
artilleryman
know
how
the
israelites
felt
when
they
gathered
manna
off
the
ground
out
of
the
cornfield
they
passed
into
a
shaggy
finger
of
forest
suddenly
firing
broke
out
ahead
steve
started
like
a
squirrel
that
close
to
us
there
the
railroad
said
the
other
there
fair
oaks
station
they
had
entrenchments
there
but
the
scouts
say
they
evacuated
them
this
morning

they
make
a
stand
reckon
it
be
at
savage
station
that
musketry
popping
down
the
line
come
on
i
can
go
pretty
fast
he
plied
his
staff
they
came
into
another
ragged
field
narrow
and
sloping
to
a
stretch
of
railroad
track
and
the
smoking
ruins
of
a
wooden
station
around
were
numerous
earthworks
all
abandoned
beyond
the
station
on
either
side
the
road
grey
troops
were
massing
the
firing
ahead
was
as
yet
desultory
just
skirmishers
passing
the
time
of
day
said
the
artilleryman
hello
what
they
doing
on
the
railroad
track
well
i
should
think
so
across
the
track
immediately
below
them
had
been
thrown
by
the
retreating
army
a
very
considerable
barricade
broken
wagons
felled
trees
logs
and
a
great
mass
of
earth
spanned
it
like
a
landslide
over
and
about
it
worked
a
grey
company
detailed
to
clear
the
way
from
the
edge
of
a
wood
not
many
yards
up
the
track
came
an
impatient
chorus
hurry

want
to

railroad

over

steve

for
the
return
of
a
staff
officer

he
had
sent
to
the
grapevine
bridge
three
miles
away
the
shell
which
had
burst
over
the
party
clearing
the
railroad
track
was
but
the
first
of
many
concealed
by
the
heavy
woods

of
the
centre
and
began
to
answer
the
blue
guns
a
courier
arrived
from

dense

a
dead
silence

mclaws

roman
directness
in
my
opinion
there

two
jacksons
the
one
that
came
down
here
left
the
other
one
in
the

shriek
and
exploded

head
of
the
mississippi
brigade
the
mississippians

the
railroad
in
the
long
shadows
of
the
late
afternoon
the
working
party
cleared
away
the
last
layer
of
earth
and
log
and
stood
back
happy
come
on
you
old
railroad
gun
and
stop
your
blaspheming

the
engine
blush
for
you
the
railroad
gun
puffed
up
cannoneers
picturesquely
draped
where
there
was
hold
for
foot
or
hand
there
was
a
momentary
pause
filled
with
an
interchange
of
affectionate
oaths
and
criticism
the
lame
artilleryman
laid
hold
of
the
flat
car

kershaw
griffith

brigades
advancing
in
line
through
light
and
shadow
wood
and
clearing
came
presently
into
touch
with
the
enemy
there
followed
a
running
fight
the
federals
slowly
retreating
everywhere
through
wood
and
clearing
appeared
mcclellan
earthworks
behind
these
the
blue
made
stand
but
at
last
from
line
to
line
the
grey
pressed
them
back
a
deep
cut
appeared
over
which
ran
a
railroad
bridge
then
woods
fields
a
second
ruined
railroad
station
beside
which
were
burning
cars
filled
with
quartermaster
stores
beyond
these
a
farmhouse
a
peach
orchard
and
a
field
crossed
by
long
rows
of
hospital
tents
before
the
farmhouse
appeared
a
strong
federal
line
of
battle
and
from
every
little
eminence
the
blue
cannon
blazed
kershaw
charged
furiously
the
two
lines
clashed
and
clanged
semmes
brigade
came
into
action
on
the
right
kemper
battery
supporting
griffith
now
barksdale
joined
battle
with
a
yell
the
mississippians
bent
on
avenging
griffith
the
air
filled
with
smoke
the
roar
of
guns
and
the
rattle
of
musketry
there
occurred
in
the
late
afternoon
a
bloody
fight
between
forces
not
large
and
fairly
matched
the
engine
pushing
the
railroad
gun
alternately
puffed
and
shrieked
through
dark
woodland
and
clearing
a
courier
appeared
signalling
with
his
hat
general
magruder
there
by
the
bridge
over
the
cut
says
on
says
the
bridge
and
get
into
battery
in
the
field
beyond
says
up
the
and
the
engine
hurried
with
a
wild
rattle
and
roar
the
crew
all
yelling
black
smoke
everywhere
and
the
whistle
screaming
like
a
new
kind
of
shell
the
whole
came
out
of
the
wood
upon
the
railroad
bridge
instantly
there
burst
from
the
blue
batteries
a
tremendous
raking
fire
shot

through

into

by

the

where
they
and
the

stubbornly
engaged
on

the

to

the

rested
on

the

took
up

their

toward

they
left
in
the
hands
of
the
grey
their
dead
several
hundred
prisoners
and
hundred
men
in
hospital
in
the
hot
and
sultry
night
dark
with
presage
of
a
storm
through
a
ruined
country
by
the
light
of
their
own
burning
stores
the
blue
column
wound
slowly
on
by
the
single
road
toward
white
oak
swamp
and
its

the

found
food
where

went

where
there
was
none
answered
to

and
listened
to
the
silence
after
many
names
then
lay
down
in
field
and
wood
beneath
the
gathering
clouds
some
time
between
sunset
and
the
first
star
steve
dagg
found
himself
he
hardly
knew
how
crouching
in
a
line
of
pawpaw
bushes
bordering
a
shallow
ravine
the
clay
upon
his
shirt
and
trousers
made
it
seem
probable
that
he
had
rolled
down
the
embankment
from
the
railroad
gun
to
the
level
below
that
he
was
out
of
breath
panting
in
hard
painful
gasps
might
indicate
that
he
had
run
like
a
hare
across
the
field
he
could
not
remember
anyhow
here
he
was
a
little
out
of
hell
just
fringing
it
as
it
were
lying
close
to
earth
between
the
smooth
pawpaw
stems
the
large
leaves
making
a
for
him
steve
felt
deadly
sick
o
gawd
why
i
volunteer
in
seein
i
ca
volunteer
out
behind
him
he
heard
the
roaring
of
the
guns
the
singing
of
the
minies
a
chance
shell
went
over
his
head
dug
itself
into
the
soil
at
the
bottom
of
the
ravine
and
exploded
the
earth
came
pattering
upon
the
pawpaw
leaves
steve
curled
up
like
a
hedgehog
o
gawd
i
ai
got
a
friend
in
the
world
why
did
i
stay
on
thunder
run
and
marry
lucinda
heard
at
dark
the
guns
ceased
in
the
silence
his
nausea
lessened
and
the
chill
sweat
dried
upon
him
he
lay
quiet
for
awhile
and
then
he
parted
the
pawpaw
bushes
and
crept
out
he
looked
over
his
shoulder
at
the
field
of
battle
i
ai
going
and
meet
that
gunner
again
damn
him
to
everlasting
hell
he
looked
across
the
ravine
toward
the
west
but
a
vision
came
to
him
of
the
hospital
in
the
wood
and
of
how
the
naked
dead
men
and
the
severed
legs
and
arms
might
stir
at
night
he
shivered
and
grew
sick
again
southward
there
was
a
glare
upon
all
that
horizon
and
a
sound
of
distant
explosions
the
yankees
were
sweeping
through
the
woods
that
way
and
they
might
kill
him
on
sight
without
waiting
for
him
to
explain
a
grey
army
was
also
over
there
lee
and
longstreet
and
hill
he
was
as
afraid
of
the
grey
as
of
the
blue
after
the
railroad
gun
he
was
afraid
of
a
shadow
finally
he
turned
northward
toward
the
chickahominy
again
the
night
so
dark
and
hot
presently
became
darker
by
reason
of
masses
of
clouds
rising
swiftly
from
the
horizon
and
blotting
out
the
stars
they
hung
low
they
pressed
heavily
beneath
them
a
and
breathless
air
lightnings
began
to
flash
thunder
to
mutter
yah
whimpered
steve
i
going
to
get
wet
again
it
true
agin
me
he
came
again
upon
the
swampy
margin
of
the
chickahominy
it
was
wide
threaded
by
motionless
waters
barred
and
banded
with
swamp
shrubs
set
with
enormously
tall
and
solemn
trees
steve
creeping
between
protruding
roots
heard
a
screech
owl
in
the
distance
it
cried
and
cried
but
then
the
thunder
rolled
more
loudly
and
drowned
its
hooting
he
came
flush
with
the
dark
stretch
of
the
river
gawd
do
i
want
to
get
across
or
do
i
want
to
stay
here
i
wish
i
was
dead
no
i
do
he
faced
the
lightning
gawd
that
was
jes
a
mistake
take
any
notice
of
it
yaaah
he
had
set
his
foot
on
a
log
which
gave
beneath
it
and
sank
into
deep
water
with
a
screech
like
the
owl
he
drew
back
and
squeezed
himself
trembling
between
the
roots
of
a
he
concluded
that
he
would
stay
here
until
the
dawn
the
storm
drew
nearer
with
long
lightnings
and
thunder
that
crashed
and
rolled
through
the
swamp
a
vivid
flash
holding
a
second
or
more
showed
the
stretch
of
the
river
and
several
hundred
yards
above
nook
a
part
of
a
high
railroad
bridge
the
gaunt
trestle
ran
out
past
midstream
then
stopped
all
the
portion
toward
the
northern
shore
burned
away
it
stood
against
the
intensely
lit
sky
and
stream
like
the
skeleton
of
some
antediluvian
monster
then
vanished
into
stygian
darkness
the
thunder
crashed
at
once
an
clap
followed
by
long
reverberations
as
these
died
in
the
span
of
silence
before
should
come
the
next
flash
and
crash
steve
became
conscious
of
another
sound
dull
and
distant
at
first
then
nearer
and
rushingly
loud
train
on
the
track
down
there
what
in
hell
it
ca
cross
he
stood
up
held
by
a
sapling
and
craned
his
neck
to
look
up
the
river
a
great
flash
showed
the
bridge
again

about
here

fighting
what
they
doing
with
the

they
must
have
burned
the

themselves
gawd
a
wildly
vivid
orange
flash
lit
water
wood
and
sky
and
the
gaunt
half
of
a
bridge
stopping
dead
short
in
the
middle
of
the
chickahominy
the
thunder
crashed
and
rolled
then
out
of
that
sound
grew
another
the
noise
of
a
rushing
train
something
huge
and
dark
roared
from
the
wooded
banks
out
upon
the
bridge
it
belched
black
smoke
mingled
with
sparks
behind
it
were
cars
and
these
were
burning
the
whole
came
full
upon
the
broken
bridge
it
swayed
beneath
the
weight
but
before
it
could
fall
and
before
the
roaring
engine
reached
the
gap
the
flames
of
the
kindled
cars
touched
the
huge
stores
of
ammunition
sent
thus
to
destruction
by
the
retreating
column
in
the
night
over
the
chickahominy
occurred
a
rending
and
awful
explosion
steve
coming
to
himself
rose
to
his
knees
in
the
black
mire
the
lightning
flashed
and
he
stared
with
a
contorted
face
the
bridge
too
was
gone
there
was
only
the
churned
water
filled
with
scantlings
and
torn
branches
of
trees
the
rain
was
falling
a
great
hissing
sweep
of
rain
and
the
wind
howled
beneath
the
thunder
steve
turned
blindly
he
did
not
know
where
he
was
going
but
he
had
a
conviction
that
the
river
was
rising
and
would
come
after
him
a
hundred
yards
from
the
water
in
the
midnight
wood
as
he
hurried
over
earth
that
the
rain
was
fast
turning
into
morass
he
stumbled
over
some
obstacle
and
fell
putting
out
his
hands
they
came
flat
against
a
dead
man
face
he
rose
and
fled
with
a
screech
southwardly
now
in
the
direction

richard

riding
at
the

of

opined
that
it
was
as
clear
as
the

a
reconnoitring
party
brought
him
news
about
something
or
other
to
the
eastward
he
jerked
his
head
swore
reflectively
and
asked
where
was
old

he
rode
ahead
sir

stafford
went
riding
through
the
cool
high
glory
of
the
morning
he
found
jackson
and
magruder
at
the
edge
of
the
peach
orchard
all
around
were
magruder
troops
and
every
man
head
was
turned
toward
the
stark
and
figure
on
the
nag
the
first
had
come
from
the
valley
with
a
towering
reputation
nor
indeed
did
the
last
lack
bards
to
sing
of
him
whatever
tarn
cap
the
one
had
worn
during
the
past
three
days
however
bewildering
had
been
his
inaction
his
reputation
held
this
was
jackson
there
must
have
been
some
good
reason
this
was
stonewall
jackson
magruder
brigades
cheered
him
vehemently
and
he
looked
at
them
unsmiling
with
a
mere
motion
of
his
hand
toward
the
rusty
old
cadet
cap
magruder
magnificently
soldierly
with
much
of
manner
and
rich
colour
magnanimously
forgetful
this
morning
of
other
important
duties
and
affably
debonair
though
his
eyelids
dropped
for
want
of
sleep
came
gradually
to
halt

jackson
gathered
up
his
reins
nodded
and
rode
off
the
troops
cheering
as
he
went
by
stafford
coming
up
with
him
saluted
and
gave
his
message
jackson
received
it
with
impassivity
and
rode
on
conceiving
it
to
be
his
duty
to
attend
an
answer
the
staff
officer
accompanied
him
though
a
little
in
the
rear
here
were
an
aide
and
a
courier
and
the
three
rode
silently
behind
their
silent
chief
at
the
williamsburg
road
there
came
a
halt
jackson
checked
little
sorrel
and
sat
looking
toward
richmond
down
the
road
in
the
sunrise
light
came
at
a
canter
a
knot
of
horsemen
handsomely
mounted
and
equipped
the
one
in
front
tall
and
riding
an
stafford
recognized
the
jackson
sat
very
still
beneath
a
honey
locust
the
night
before
in
a
wood
hard
by
the
mississippi
had
run
into
a
federal
brigade
the
latter
had
fired
at
point
blank
a
withering
volley
many
a
tall
mississippian
had
fallen
now
in
the
early
light
their
fellow
soldiers
had
gone
seeking
them
in
the
wood
drawn
them
forth
and
laid
them
in
a
row
in
the
wet
sedge
beside
the
road
nearly
every
man
had
been
shot
through
the
brain
they
lay
ghastly
wet
with
rain
staring
at
the
cool
and
pure
concave
of
the
sky
two
or
three
soldiers
were
moving
slowly
up
and
down
the
line
bent
on
identifications
presumably
jackson
was
aware
of
that
company
of
the
dead
but
their
presence
could
not
be
said
to
disturb
him
he
sat
with
his
large
hands
folded
over
the
with
the
forage
cap
cutting
all
but
one
gleam
of
his
eyes
still
as
stone
wall
or
mountain
or
the
dead
across
the
way
as
the
horsemen
came
nearer
his
lips
parted
that
is
general
lee
yes
general
good
lee
staff
halted
lee
himself
came
on
checked
the
dismounted
and
walked
toward
the
honey
locust
jackson
swung
himself
stiffly
out
of
the
saddle
and
stepped
forward
the
two
met
lee
stretched
out
his
hand
said
something
in
his
gracious
voice
the
piteous
row
of
dead
men
with
their
open
eyes
caught
his
glance
he
drew
his
brows
together
pressed
his
lips
hard
parted
them
in
a
sigh
and
went
on
with
his
speech
the
two
men
so
different
in
aspect
talked
not
long
together
the
staff
could
not
hear
what
was
said
but
lee
spoke
the
most
and
very
earnestly
jackson
nodded
said
good
several
times
and
once
it
is
in
god
hands
general
lee
the
courier
holding
traveller
brought
him
up
lee
mounted
tarried
a
great
and
gallant
figure
a
moment
longer
then
rode
toward
magruder
at
the
peach
orchard
his
staff
followed
saluting
stonewall
jackson
as
they
passed
he
too
remounted
in
his
stiff
and
awkward
fashion
and
turned
little
sorrel
head
down
the
williamsburg
road
behind
him
now
in
the
clear
bright
morning
could
be
heard
the
tramp
of
his
brigades
stafford
pushed
his
horse
level
with
the
sorrel
your
pardon
general
but
may
i
ask
if
there
any
order
for
general
ewell
there
is
none
sir
then
shall
i
return
no
you
will
wait
sir
from
the
i
may
send
directions
they
rode
on
by
wood
and
field
overhead
was
a
clear
high
azure
sky
no
clouds
but
many
black
sailing
specks
around
on
the
sandy
road
and
in
the
shaggy
bordering
growth
were
witnesses
enough
to
the
federal
retreat
a
confused
medley
of
abandoned
objects
broken
and
wagons
appeared
like
wreckage
from
a
storm
there
did
not
lack
dead
or
dying
horses
nor
here
and
there
dead
or
wounded
men
in
the
thicker
woods
or
wandering
through
the
ruined
fields
appeared
forlornly
stragglers
from
the
federal
column
hill
leading
the
grey
advance
swept
up
hundreds
of
these
from
every
direction
spirals
of
smoke
rose
into
the
crystal
air
barns
and
farmhouses
mills
fences
hayricks
and
monster
heaps
of
federal
stores
set
on
fire
in
that
memorable
change
of
base
for
all
the
sunshine
of
the
june
morning
the
air
the
singing
birds
in
the
jewelled
green
of
the
forest
there
was
something
in
the
time
and
place
inexpressibly
sinister
and
sad
or
so
thought
maury
stafford
riding
silently
with
the
aide
and
the
courier
at
gaines
mill
he
had
won
emphatic
praise
for
a
cool
and
daring
ride
across
the
battlefield
and
for
the
quick
rallying
and
leading
into
action
of
a
command
whose
officers
were
all
down
with
ewell
at
dispatch
station
he
had
volunteered
for
duty
at
the
crossing
of
the
chickahominy
and
in
a
fight
with
a
retiring
federal
regiment
he
and
his
detachment
had
acquitted
themselves
supremely
well
as
far
as
this
warfare
went
he
had
reason
to
be
satisfied
but
he
was
not
so
and
as
he
rode
he
thought
the
morning
scene
of
a
twilight
dreariness
he
had
no
enthusiasm
for
war
in
every
aspect
of
life
save
one
that
he
dealt
with
he
carried
a
cool
and
level
head
and
he
thought
war
barbarous
and
its
waste
a
great
tragedy
martial
music
and
charges
moved
him
for
a
moment
as
they
moved
others
for
an
hour
or
a
day
the
old
instinctive
response
passed
with
swiftness
and
he
settled
to
the
base
of
a
steadfast
conclusion
that
humanity
turned
aside
to
the
jungle
many
times
too
often
in
a
century
that
individually
he
had
turned
into
a
certain
other
allied
jungle
he
was
conscious
not
sardonically
conscious
for
here
all
his
judgment
was
warped
but
conscious
his
mind
ranged
in
this
jungle
with
an
unhappy
fury
hardly
modern
as
he
rode
he
looked
toward
richmond
he
knew
though
he
scarcely
knew
how
he
knew
that
judith
cary
was
there
he
had
himself
meant
to
ride
to
richmond
that
idle
then
had
come
the
necessity
of
accompanying
ewell
to
dispatch
station
and
his
chance
was
gone
the
stonewall
brigade
had
been
idle
enough
perhaps
the
colonel
of
the
had
gone
it
was
a
thick
and
bitter
jungle
and
he
gathered
every
thorn
within
it
to
himself
and
smelled
of
every
poisonous
flower
the
small
silent
cavalcade
came
to
a
jackson
stopped
sitting
little
sorrel
beneath
a
tall
gaunt
pine
the
three
with
him
waited
a
few
feet
off
behind
them
they
heard
the
column
hill
leading
then
jackson
own
division
the
sun
was
above
the
treetops
the
sky
cloudless
all
the
forest
glistening
the
minutes
passed
jackson
sat
like
a
stone
at
last
from
the
heavy
wood
pierced
by
the
came
a
rapid
clatter
of
hoofs
munford
appeared
behind
him
fifty
of
his
cavalry
the
fifty
checked
their
horses
the
leader
came
on
and
saluted
jackson
spoke
in
the
peculiar
voice
he
used
when
displeased
colonel
munford
i
ordered
you
to
be
here
at
sunrise
munford
explained
the
men
were
much
scattered
sir
they
do
know
the
country
and
in
the
storm
last
night
and
the
thick
wood
they
could
see
their
horses
ears
they
had
nothing
to
eat
and
he
came
to
a
pause
no
amount
of
good
reasons
ever
for
long
rolled
fluently
off
the
tongue
before
jackson
he
spoke
now
still
in
the
concentrated
monotony
of
his
voice
of
displeasure
yes
sir
but
colonel
i
ordered
you
to
be
here
at
sunrise
move
on
with
your
men
if
you
meet
the
enemy
drive
in
his
pickets
and
if
you
want
artillery
colonel
crutchfield
will
furnish
you
munford
moved
on
his
body
of
horse
increasing
in
size
as
the
lost
troopers
emerged
in
twos
and
threes
or
singly
from
the
forest
and
turned
down
the
road
to
join
the
command
the
proceeding
gave
an
effect
of
disordered
ranks
jackson
beckoned
the
courier
go
tell
colonel
munford
that
his
men
are
straggling
badly
the
courier
went
and
presently
returned
munford
was
with
him
general
i
thought
i
had
best
come
myself
and
explain
they
straggling
we
were
all
separated
in
the
dark
night
and
yes
sir
but
i
ordered
you
to
be
here
at
sunrise
move
on
now
and
drive
in
the
enemy
pickets
and
if
you
want
artillery
colonel
crutchfield
will
furnish
you
munford
and
the
virginia
went
on
disappearing
around
a
bend
in
the
road
the
sound
of
the
artillery
coming
up
was
now
loud
in
the
clear
air
jackson
listened
a
moment
then
left
the
shadow
of
the
pine
and
with
the
two
attending
officers
and
the
courier
resumed
the
way
to
white
oak
swamp
brigade
by
brigade
thousand
men
in
grey
passed
savage
station
and
followed
stonewall
jackson
the
air
was
fresh
the
troops
in
spirits
nobody
was
going
to
let
mcclellan
get
to
the
james
after
all
the
brigades
broke
into
song
they
laughed
they
joked
they
cheered
every
popular
field
officer
as
he
passed
they
genially
discussed
the
heretofore
difficulties
of
the
campaign
and
the
roseate
promise
of
the
day
they
knew
it
was
the
crucial
day
that
mcclellan
must
be
stopped
before
sunset
or
he
would
reach
the
shelter
of
his
gunboats
they
were
in
a
fourth
of
july
humour
they
meant
to
make
the
day
remembered
life
seemed
bright
again
and
much
worth
while
they
even
grudgingly
agreed
that
there
was
a
curious
kind
of
attractiveness
about
all
this
flat
country
and
the
still
waters
and
the
very
tall
trees
and
labyrinthine
vivid
green
undergrowth
intermittent
fevers
had
begun
to
appear
but
one
and
all
the
invalids
declared
that
this
was
their
good
day
shucks
what
a
little
ague
anyhow
it
go
away
when
we
get
back
to
the
valley
going
back
to
the
valley
well
we
should
think
so
this
country
got
an
eerie
kind
of
good
looks
and
it
raises
sweet
potatoes
all
right
but
for
steady
company
give
us
mountains
we
drop
mcclellan
in
one
of
these
swamps
and
we
have
a
review
at
the
fair
grounds
at
richmond
so
all
the
ladies
can
see
us
and
then
we
go
back
to
the
valley
pike
and
massanutton
and
commissary
banks
they
must
be
missing
us
awful
somebody
sing
something
old
grimes
is
dead
that
good
old
man
whom
we
shall
see
no
more
he
wore
a
grey
confederate
coat
all
buttoned
down
before
do
like
it
that
way
all
right
he
wore
a
blue
coat
all
buttoned
down
before
the
stonewall
brigade
passed
a
grave
in
a
small
graveyard
from
which
the
fence
had
been
burned
a
little
further
on
they
came
to
a
burned
smithy
the
blacksmith
house
beside
it
also
a
ruin
black
and
charred
on
a
stone
between
two
sat
a
very
old
man
beside
him
stood
a
girl
a
handsome
creature
dark
and
send
them
to
hell
boys
send
them
to
hell
quavered
the
old
man
the
girl
raised
a
sweet
and
vibrant
voice
send
them
to
hell
men
send
them
to
hell
we
do
our
best
we
do
our
best
answered
the
stonewall
the
sun
mounted
high
they
were
moving
now
through
thick
woods
broken
by
deep
creeks
and
bits
of
swamp
all
about
were
evidences
enough
that
an
army
had
travelled
before
them
and
that
that
army
was
exceedingly
careless
of
its
belongings
all
manner
of
impediments
lay
squandered
waste
and
ruin
were
everywhere
sometimes
the
men
caught
an
odour
of
burning
meat
of
rice
and
breadstuffs
in
a
marshy
meadow
a
number
of
wrecked
wagons
showed
like
a
patch
of
mushrooms
giant
and
dingy
in
a
forest
glade
rested
like
a
siegfried
smithy
an
abandoned
travelling
forge
hacked
in
two
were
met
with
and
boxes
of
sutlers
wares
smashed
to
fragments
the
dead
horses
were
many
and
there
was
disgust
with
the
buzzards
they
rose
or
settled
in
such
clouds
the
troops
stooping
to
drink
from
the
creeks
complained
that
the
water
was
foul
very
deep
woods
appeared
on
the
horizon

anyway
god

the

been
growing
on
us
for
a
week
munford
sent
back
a
courier
to
jackson
riding
well
before
the
head
of
the
column
bridge
is
burned
sir
they
in
strong
force
on
the
other
side
good
said
jackson
tell
colonel
crutchfield
to
bring
up
the
guns
he
rode
on
the
aide
the
courier
and
maury
stafford
yet
with
him
they
passed
a
deserted
federal
camp
and
hospital
and
came
between
tall
trees
and
through
dense
swamp
undergrowth
to
a
small
stream
with
many
arms
it
lay
still
beneath
the
blue
sky
overhung
by
many
a
graceful
tree
the
swamp
growth
stretched
for
some
distance
on
either
side
and
through
openings
in
the
foliage
the
blue
glint
of
the
arms
could
be
seen
to
the
right
there
was
some
cleared
ground
in
front
the
road
stopped
short
the
one
bridge
had
been
burned
by
the
retreating
federal
rearguard
two
blue
divisions
three
batteries
in
all
over
twenty
thousand
men
now
waited
on
the
southern
bank
to
dispute
the
white
oak
crossing
stafford
again
pushed
his
horse
beside
jackson
well
sir
i
hunted
once
through
this
swamp
general
there
is
an
old
crossing
near
the
bridge
passable
for
cavalry
sir
passable
by
cavalry
and
infantry
sir
even
the
guns
might
somehow
be
gotten
across
i
asked
sir
if
it
was
passable
for
cavalry
it
is
sir
jackson
turned
to
his
aide
go
tell
colonel
crutchfield
i
want
to
see
him
crutchfield
appeared
where
are
your
guns
colonel
general
their
batteries
on
the
ridge
over
there
command
the
road
and
the
thick
woods
below
their
guns
are
filled
with
sharpshooters
i
want
to
get
the
guns
behind
the
crest
of
the
hill
on
this
side
and
i
am
opening
a
road
through
the
wood
over
there
they
be
up
directly
seven
batteries
carter
hardaway
nelson
rhett
reilly
and
balthis
we
open
then
at
a
thousand
yards
and
take
them
i
think
by
surprise
very
good
colonel
that
is
all
the
infantry
began
to
arrive
brigade
by
brigade
as
it
came
up
turned
to
right
or
to
left
standing
under
arms
in
the
wood
above
the
white
oak
swamp
as
the
stonewall
brigade
came
under
tall
trees
and
over
earth
that
gave
beneath
the
feet
flush
with
the
stream
itself
the
grey
guns
now
in
place
upon
the
low
ridge
to
the
right
opened
of
them
with
simultaneous
thunder
crutchfield
manoeuvre
had
not
been
observed
the
guns
blazed
without
warning
and
the
blue
artillery
fell
into
confusion
the
parrotts
blazed
in
turn
four
times
then
they
limbered
up
in
haste
and
left
the
ridge
crutchfield
sent
wooding
battery
tearing
down
the
slope
to
the
road
immediately
in
front
of
the
burned
bridge
wooding
opened
fire
and
drove
out
the
infantry
support
from
the
opposite
forest
jackson
riding
toward
the
stream
encountered
munford
colonel
move
your
men
over
the
creek
and
take
those
guns
munford
looked
i
do
know
that
we
can
cross
it
sir
yes
you
can
cross
it
colonel
try
munford
and
a
part
of
the
virginia
dashed
in
the
stream
was
in
truth
narrow
enough
and
though
it
was
deep
here
with
a
shifting
bottom
and
though
the
debris
from
the
ruined
bridge
made
it
full
of
snares
the
horsemen
got
across
and
pushed
up
the
shore
toward
the
guns
a
thick
and
leafy
wood
to
the
right
leaped
fire
another
and
unsuspected
body
of
blue
infantry
the
echoes
were
yet
ringing
when
from
above
an
unseen
battery
opened
on
the
luckless
cavalry
the
blue
rifles
cracked
again
the
horses
began
to
rear
and
plunge
several
men
were
hit
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
get
somehow
back
to
the
north
bank
munford
and
his
men
pushed
out
of
the
rain
of
iron
through
the
wood
for
some
distance
down
the
stream
and
there
recrossed
not
without
difficulty
the
guns
shelled
the
wood
which
had
last
spoken
and
drove
out
the
skirmishers
with
whom
it
was
filled
these
took
refuge
in
another
deep
and
leafy
belt
still
commanding
the
stream
and
the
ruined
causeway
a
party
of
grey
pioneers
fell
to
work
to
rebuild
the
bridge
from
the
crest
on
the
southern
side
behind
the
deep
foliage
two
federal
batteries
before
unnoted
opened
on
the
grey
cannoneers
wooding
on
the
road
before
the
bridge
had
to
fall
back
under
cover
of
the
guns
the
blue
infantry
swarmed
again
into
the
wood
shell
and
bullet
hissed
and
pattered
into
the
water
by
the
abutments
of
the
ruined
bridge
the
working
party
drew
back
damnation
they
must
fling
them
minies
round
loose
like
that
wright
brigade
of
huger
division
came
up
wright
made
his
report
we
tried
brackett
ford
a
mile
up
stream
sir
could
manage
it
got
two
companies
over
by
the
skin
of
our
teeth
they
drove
in
some
pickets
on
the
other
side
road
through
the
swamp
over
there
covered
by
felled
trees
beyond
is
a
small
meadow
and
beyond
that
rising
ground
almost
free
of
trees
there
are
yankee
batteries
on
the
crest
and
a
large
force
of
infantry
lying
along
the
side
of
the
ridge
they
command
the
meadow
and
the
swamp
so
tall
were
the
trees
so
thick
the
undergrowth
so
full
the
midsummer
foliage
that
the
guns
thundering
at
each
other
across
the
narrow
stream
never
saw
their
antagonists
sharpshooters
and
skirmishers
were
as
hidden
except
as
regarded
the
pioneers
striving
with
the
bridge
neither
side
could
see
the
damage
that
was
done
the
noise
was
tremendous
echoing
loudly
from
the
opposing
low
ridges
and
rolling
through
the
swamp
the
hollow
filled
with
smoke
above
the
treetops
a
dull
saffron
veil
was
drawn
across
the
sky
the
firing
was
without
intermission
a
monotonous
thunder
beneath
which
the
working
party
strove
spasmodically
at
the
bridge
the
cavalry
chafed
to
and
fro
and
the
infantry
filling
all
the
woods
and
the
little
clearings
to
the
rear
began
to
swear
is
it
the
red
sea
down
there
why
ca
we
cross
without
a
bridge
nobody
going
to
get
drowned
ai
a
hundred
men
been
drowned
since
this
war
began
o
great
day
in
the
morning
tired
of
doing
nothing
general
wade
hampton
of
hill
division
leaving
his
brigade
in
a
pine
wood
went
with
his
son
and
with
an
aide
rawlins
lowndes
on
a
reconnoitring
expedition
of
his
own
he
was
a
woodsman
and
hunter
with
experience
of
swamps
and
bayous
returning
he
sought
out
jackson
and
found
him
sitting
on
a
fallen
pine
by
the
roadside
near
the
slowly
slowly
mending
bridge
hampton
dismounted
and
made
his
report
we
got
over
three
of
us
general
a
short
way
above
it
was
difficult
the
stream
clear
of
obstructions
there
and
has
a
sandy
bottom
we
could
see
through
the
trees
on
the
other
side
there
a
bit
of
level
and
a
hillside
covered
with
troops
a
strong
position
but
we
got
across
the
stream
sir
yes
can
you
make
a
bridge
there
i
can
make
one
for
infantry
sir
not
i
think
for
the
artillery
cutting
a
road
would
expose
our
position
very
good
make
the
bridge
general
hampton
men
cut
saplings
and
threw
a
rude
across
the
stream
where
he
had
traversed
it
he
returned
and
reported
they
are
quiet
and
unsuspecting
beyond
sir
the
crossing
would
be
slow
and
there
may
be
an
accident
but
cross
we
certainly
can
jackson
still
seated
on
the
fallen
pine
sat
as
though
he
had
been
there
through
eternity
and
would
remain
through
eternity
the
gun
thundered
the
minies
sang
one
of
the
latter
struck
a
tree
above
his
head
and
severed
a
leafy
twig
it
came
floating
down
touched
his
shoulder
like
an
accolade
and
rested
on
the
pine
needles
by
his
foot
he
gave
it
no
attention
sitting
like
a
graven
image
with
clasped
hands
listening
to
the
south
carolinian
report
hampton
ceased
to
speak
and
waited
it
was
the
height
of
the
afternoon
he
stood
three
minutes
in
silence
perhaps
then
glanced
toward
the
man
on
the
log
jackson
eyes
were
closed
his
head
slightly
lifted
praying
thought
the
south
carolinian
well
there
a
time
for
everything
jackson
opened
his
eyes
drew
the
forage
cap
far
down
over
them
and
rose
from
the
pine
the
other
looked
for
him
to
speak
but
he
said
nothing
he
walked
a
little
way
down
the
road
and
stood
among
the
whistling
minies
looking
at
the
slowly
slowly
building
bridge
hampton
did
as
wright
and
munford
had
done
before
him
went
back
to
his
men
hill
after
an
interview
of
his
own
had
retired
to
the
artillery
yes
yes
rhett
go
ahead
do
something
make
a
noise
do
something
infantry
kept
home
from
school
measles
i
reckon
or
maybe
it
lockjaw
about
three
there
was
caught
from
the
southward
between
the
loud
wrangling
of
the
batteries
above
white
oak
another
sound
first
two
or
three
detonations
occurring
singly
then
a
prolonged
and
continuous
roar
the
batteries
above
white
oak
swamp
the
sharpshooters
and
skirmishers
the
grey
chafing
cavalry
the
grey
masses
of
unemployed
infantry
all
held
breath
and
listened
the
sound
was
not
three
miles
away
and
it
was
the
sound
of
the
crash
of
long
there
was
a
curious
movement
among
the
men
nearest
the
grey
with
their
bodies
bent
forward
they
looked
his
way
expecting
short
quick
orders
he
rested
immobile
his
eyes
just
gleaming
beneath
the
cap
little
sorrel
cropping
the
marsh
grass
beside
him
munford
coming
up
ventured
a
remark
general
longstreet
or
general
hill
has
joined
with
their
centre
i
suppose
general
the
firing
is
very
heavy
yes
the
troops
that
have
been
lying
before
richmond
general
lee
will
see
that
they
do
what
is
right
stafford
near
him
spoke
again
the
sound
comes
i
think
sir
from
a
place
called
glendale
glendale
or
frayser
farm
yes
sir
said
jackson
very
probably
the
thunder
never
lessened
artillery
and
infantry
franklin
corps
on
the
south
bank
of
white
oak
began
again
to
pour
an
iron
hail
against
the
opposing
guns
and
the
working
party
at
the
bridge
but
in
every
interval
between
the
explosions
from
these
cannon
there
rolled
louder
and
louder
the
thunder
from
frayser
farm
a
sound
like
a
grating
wind
in
a
winter
forest
ran
through
the
idle
grey
brigades
it
hill
battle
again
a
hill
or
longstreet
magruder
and
huger
and
holmes
and
hill
and
longstreet
and
we
out
of
it
again
on
the
wrong
side
of
white
oak
swamp
and
they
looking
for
us
to
help
i
was
dead
the
virginia
had
its
place
some
distance
up
the
stream
in
a
tangled
wood
by
the
water
facing
southward
it
held
the
extreme
right
beyond
it
only
morass
tall
trees
swaying
masses
of
vine
on
the
left
an
arm
of
the
creek
thickly
screened
by
tree
and
bush
divided
it
from
the
remainder
of
the
brigade
it
rested
in
and
its
ten
companies
stared
in
anger
at
the
narrow
stream
and
the
deep
woods
beyond
listening
to
the
thunder
of
longstreet
and
unsupported
attack
and
the
answering
roar
of
the
federal
army
corps
it
was
a
sullen
noise
deep
and
unintermittent
the
waiting
for
orders
could
have
wept
as
the
orders
did
not
come
get
across
well
if
general
jackson
would
just
give
us
leave
to
try
oh
hell
listen
to
that
colonel
ca
you
do
something
for
us
where
the
colonel
gone
cleave
was
beyond
their
vision
he
had
rounded
a
little
point
of
land
and
now
dundee
hoofs
in
water
stood
gazing
at
the
darkly
wooded
opposite
shore
he
stood
a
moment
thus
then
spoke
to
the
horse
and
they
entered
the
stream
it
was
not
deep
and
though
there
were
obstructions
old
stakes
and
drowned
brushwood
cleave
and
dundee
crossed
the
air
was
full
of
booming
sound
but
there
was
no
motion
in
the
wood
into
which
they
rose
from
the
water
all
its
floor
was
marshy
water
in
pools
and
threads
a
slight
growth
of
cane
and
above
the
tall
and
solemn
trees
cleave
saw
that
there
was
open
meadow
beyond
dismounting
he
went
noiselessly
to
the
edge
of
the
swamp
an
open
space
covered
with
some
low
growth
beyond
it
a
hillside
wood
and
meadow
and
hill
all
lay
quiet
and
lonely
in
the
late
sunlight
he
went
back
to
dundee
remounted
passed
again
through
the
sombre
wood
over
the
boggy
earth
entered
the
water
and
recrossed
turning
the
little
point
of
the
swamp
he
rode
before
his
regiment
on
his
way
to
find
winder
his
men
greeted
him
colonel
if
you
could
just
get
us
over
there
we
do
anything
in
the
world
for
you
this
place
is
getting
awful
hard
to
bear
look
at
dundee
even
he
drooping
his
head
you
know
we
follow
you
through
hell
sir
and
if
you
could
just
manage
it
so
we
could
follow
you
through
white
oak
swamp
cleave
passed
the
arm
of
the
creek
separating
the
from
the
rest
of
the
brigade
and
asked
of
winder
from
the
first
troops
beyond
the
screen
of
trees
general
winder
has
ridden
down
to
the
bridge
to
see
general
jackson
cleave
following
found
his
leader
indeed
before
jackson
just
finishing
his
representations
whatever
they
were
and
somewhat
perturbed
by
the
commanding
general
highly
developed
silence
this
continuing
unbroken
winder
after
an
awkward
minute
of
waiting
fell
a
little
back
a
flush
on
his
cheeks
and
his
lips
hard
together
the
action
disclosed
cleave
just
come
up
his
hand
checking
dundee
his
grey
eyes
earnestly
upon
jackson
when
the
latter
spoke
it
was
not
to
the
brigadier
but
to
the
colonel
of
the
why
are
you
not
with
your
regiment
sir
i
left
it
but
a
moment
ago
sir
to
bring
information
i
thought
it
my
duty
to
bring
what
information
the
is
on
general
winder
extreme
right
sir
the
stream
before
it
is
fordable
how
do
you
know
sir
i
forded
it
the
infantry
could
cross
without
much
difficulty
the
would
be
happy
sir
to
lead
the
way
winder
opened
his
lips
the
whole
stonewall
brigade
is
ready
sir
jackson
without
regarding
continued
to
address
himself
to
cleave
his
tone
had
been
heard
before
by
the
latter
in
his
own
case
on
the
night
of
the
as
well
as
once
before
and
in
the
case
of
others
where
there
had
been
what
was
construed
as
remonstrance
or
negligence
or
disobedience
he
had
heard
him
speak
so
to
garnett
after
kernstown
the
words
were
simple
enough
they
always
were
you
will
return
to
your
duty
sir
it
lies
where
your
regiment
is
and
that
is
not
here
go
cleave
obeyed
the
ford
was
there
his
regiment
might
have
crossed
the
rest
of
the
stonewall
following
together
they
might
traverse
the
swamp
and
the
bit
of
open
pass
the
hillside
and
strike
franklin
upon
the
flank
while
brigade
by
brigade
the
rest
of
the
division
followed
by
that
ford
rout
franklin
and
push
forward
to
help
hill
it
had
appeared
his
duty
to
give
the
information
he
was
possessed
of
he
had
given
it
and
his
skirts
were
cleared
there
was
anger
in
him
as
he
turned
away
he
had
a
compressed
lip
a
sparkling
eye
not
till
he
turned
did
he
see
stafford
sitting
his
horse
in
the
shadow
behind
jackson
the
two
men
stared
full
at
each
other
for
a
perceptible
moment
but
stafford
face
was
in
the
shadow
and
as
for
cleave
his
mind
was
full
of
anger
for
the
tragedy
of
the
inaction
at
the
moment
he
gave
small
attention
to
his
own
life
its
heights
or
depths
past
or
future
he
saw
stafford
but
he
could
not
be
said
to
consider
him
at
all
he
turned
from
the
road
into
the
wood
and
pushed
the
great
bay
over
spongy
ground
toward
the
isolated
stafford
saw
that
he
gave
him
no
thought
and
it
angered
him
on
the
highroad
of
his
life
it
would
not
have
done
so
but
he
had
left
the
road
and
was
lost
in
the
jungle
there
were
few
things
that
richard
cleave
might
do
which
would
not
now
work
like
madness
on
the
mind
astray
in
that
place
the
cannonading
over
white
oak
swamp
continued
and
the
sound
of
the
battle
of
frayser
farm
continued
on
a
difficult
and
broken
ground
longstreet
attacked
driving
back
mccall
division
mccall
was
reinforced
and
longstreet
hard
pressed
lee
loosed
hill
and
the
battle
became
furious
he
looked
for
jackson
but
jackson
was
at
white
oak
swamp
for
huger
but
a
road
covered
with
felled
trees
delayed
huger
for
magruder
but
in
the
tangle
of
wood
and
swamp
magruder
too
went
astray
for
holmes
but
fitz
john
porter
held
holmes
in
check
longstreet
and
hill
strove
unsupported
fifty
thousand
grey
troops
in
hearing
of
their
guns
the
battle
swayed
to
and
fro
long
loud
and
sanguinary
with
much
work
much
use
of
bayonets
and
over
all
a
shriek
of
grape
and
canister
back
on
white
oak
swamp
franklin
on
the
southern
side
jackson
on
the
northern
blue
and
grey
alike
caught
the
noise
of
battle
they
themselves
were
cannonading
loudly
and
continuously
one
federal
battery
used
fifteen
hundred
rounds
the
grey
were
hardly
less
lavish
not
much
damage
was
done
except
to
the
trees
the
trough
through
which
crept
the
sluggish
water
was
filled
with
smoke
it
drifted
through
the
swamp
and
the
woods
and
along
the
opposing
hillsides
it
drifted
over
and
about
the
idle
infantry
until
one
command
was
hidden
from
another
stonewall
jackson
seated
on
the
stump
of
a
felled
oak
his
sabre
across
his
knees
his
hands
rigid
upon
it
his
great
booted
feet
squarely
planted
his
cap
drawn
low
sent
the
aide
beside
him
with
some
order
to
the
working
party
at
the
bridge
a
moment
later
the
courier
went
too
to
hill
with
a
query
about
prisoners
the
thunders
continued
the
smoke
drifted
heavily
veiling
all
movements
jackson
spoke
without
turning
whoever
is
there
no
one
was
there
at
the
moment
but
maury
stafford
he
came
forward
you
will
find
the
brigade
said
jackson
tell
general
winder
to
move
it
nearer
the
stream
tell
him
to
cross
from
his
right
with
caution
a
small
reconnoitring
party
let
it
find
out
the
dispositions
of
the
enemy
return
and
report
stafford
went
riding
westward
through
the
forest
and
came
presently
to
the
stonewall
brigade
and
to
winder
walking
up
and
down
disconsolately
an
order
from
general
jackson
sir
you
will
move
your
brigade
nearer
the
stream
also
you
will
cross
from
your
right
with
caution
a
small
reconnoitring
party
it
will
discover
the
dispositions
of
the
enemy
return
and
report
very
good
said
winder
i
move
at
once
the
is
already
on
the
brink
there
to
the
right
beyond
the
swamp
perhaps
you
take
the
order
on
to
colonel
cleave
very
good
tell
him
to
send
a
picked
squad
quietly
across
and
find
out
what
he
can
i
hope
to
god
there
come
another
order
for
us
all
to
cross
at
its
heels
stafford
riding
on
presently
found
himself
in
a
strip
of
bog
and
thicket
and
tall
trees
masking
a
narrow
sluggish
piece
of
water
the
brigade
behind
him
was
hidden
the
regiment
in
front
not
yet
visible
despite
the
booming
of
the
guns
there
was
here
an
effect
of
stillness
it
seemed
a
lonely
place
stafford
traversing
it
slowly
because
the
ground
gave
beneath
his
horse
feet
became
aware
of
a
slight
movement
in
a
laurel
thicket
and
of
two
eyes
gleaming
behind
the
leaves
he
reined
in
his
horse
what
are
you
doing
in
there
straggling
or
deserting
come
out
there
was
a
pause
then
steve
dagg
emerged
major
i
ai
either
stragglin
or
desertin
i
was
just
seperated
i
got
seperated
last
night

down
there
i
crept
down
an
saw

join
right
away

me
to
hell
if
i
ai
though
gawd
knows
my
foot
awful
sore
stafford
regarded
him
closely
i
seen
you
before
ah
i
remember
on
the
valley
pike
moving
toward
winchester
poor
scoundrel
steve
his
back
against
a
swamp
magnolia
undertook
to
show
that
he
too
remembered
and
that
gratefully
yes
sir
you
saved
me
from
markin
time
on
a
major
an
my
foot
sore
an
i
was
desertin
that
time
any
this
time
an
i
was
as
obleeged
to
you
as
i
could
be
the
colonel
awful
hard
on
the
men
is
he
said
stafford
gratingly
they
seem
to
like
him
he
sat
his
horse
before
the
laurel
thicket
and
despised
himself
for
holding
conference
with
this
poor
thief
or
rather
some
fibre
in
his
brain
told
him
that
out
of
this
jungle
if
ever
he
came
out
of
it
he
would
despise
himself
had
he
really
done
so
now
he
would
have
turned
away
he
did
not
so
he
sat
in
the
heart
of
the
jungle
and
compared
hatreds
with
steve
the
latter
glanced
upward
a
moment
with
his
ferret
eyes
then
turned
his
head
aside
and
spat
if
there
any
of
my
way
of
thinkin
they
like
him
but
they
all
fools
crept
down
through
the
swamp
a
little
ago
an
heard
it
get
us
across
somehow
wo
you
fight
like
hell
ca
men
i
have
any
orders
yaah
i
wish
he
take
the
regiment
over
without
them
and
then
be
and
shot
for
doing
it
steve
spat
again
i
seed
long
ago
that
you
did
like
him
either
major
he
gets
along
too
fast
all
the
prizes
come
his
way
yes
said
stafford
from
the
heart
of
the
jungle
they
come
his
way
and
he
standing
there
at
the
edge
of
the
water
hoping
for
orders
to
cross
steve
beneath
the
swamp
magnolia
had
a
widening
of
the
lips
turned
agin
him
one
way
though
he
out
of
favour
with
old
jack
the
regiment
do
know
why
but
it
saw
it
mighty
plain
day
before
yesterday
after
the
big
battle
gawd
knows
i
like
to
see
him
so
deep
in
trouble
he
never
get
out
and
so
would
you
major
prizes
would
stop
coming
his
way
then
and
he
might
lose
those
he
has
if
i
entertain
a
devil
said
stafford
i
not
be
hypocrite
enough
to
object
to
his
conversation
nor
if
i
take
his
suggestion
is
there
any
sense
in
covering
him
with
reprobation
so
go
your
way
miserable
imp
while
i
go
mine
but
steve
kept
up
with
him
at
his
stirrup
i
got
to
rejoin
it
jest
off
one
battlefield
on
to
another
and
there
ai
nowhere
else
to
go
this
world
a
sickenin
place
for
men
like
me
so
i
got
to
rejoin
ef
there
ever
anything
i
kin
do
for
you
major
at
the
head
of
the
dividing
arm
of
the
creek
they
heard
behind
them
a
horseman
and
waited
for
a
courier
to
come
up
you
are
going
on
to
the
yes
sir
i
belong
there
i
was
kept
by
general
winder
for
some
special
duty
and
i
just
through
it
i
have
an
order
said
stafford
from
general
winder
to
colonel
cleave
there
are
others
to
carry
and
time
presses
i
entrust
it
to
you
listen
now
and
get
it
straight
he
gave
an
order
the
courier
listened
nodded
energetically
repeated
it
after
him
and
gathered
up
the
reins
i
am
powerfully
glad
to
carry
that
order
sir
it
means
does
it
he
rode
off
southward
to
the
stream
in
which
direction
steve
had
already
shambled
stafford
returned
through
wood
and
swamp
to
the
road
by
the
bridge
above
and
around
the
deep
inner
jungle
his
intellect
worked
he
knew
that
he
had
done
a
villainy
knew
it
and
did
not
repent
a
nature
fine
enough
in
many
ways
lay
bound
hand
and
foot
deep
in
miasmas
and
primal
heat
captive
to
a
master
and
consuming
passion
to
create
a
solitude
where
he
alone
might
reach
one
woman
figure
he
would
have
set
a
world
afire
he
rode
back
now
through
the
woods
to
a
general
commanding
who
never
forgave
nor
listened
overmuch
to
explanations
and
he
rode
with
quietude
the
very
picture
of
a
gallant
soldier
back
on
the
edge
of
white
oak
swamp
richard
cleave
considered
the
order
he
had
received
he
found
an
ambiguity
in
the
wording
a
choice
of
constructions
he
half
turned
to
send
the
courier
again
to
winder
to
make
absolutely
sure
that
the
construction
which
he
strongly
preferred
was
correct
as
he
did
so
though
he
could
not
see
the
brigade
beyond
the
belt
of
trees
he
heard
it
in
motion
down
through
the
woods
to
cross
the
stream
in
the
rear
of
the
he
looked
at
the
ford
and
the
silent
woods
beyond
from
frayser
farm
so
short
a
distance
away
came
a
deeper
roll
of
thunder
it
had
a
solemn
and
a
pleading
sound
long
are
we
to
wait
for
any
help
cleave
knit
his
brows
then
with
a
decisive
gesture
of
his
hand
he
dismissed
the
doubt
and
stepped
in
front
of
his
colour
company
into
column
forward
on
the
road
leading
down
to
the
bridge
stafford
met
his
own
division
general
riding
rifle
back
to
his
command
hello
major
stafford
said
old
dick
i
thought
i
had
lost
you
general
jackson
detained
me
general
yes
yes
you
are
the
only
one
but
let
me
tell
you
major
coming
out
of
his
spell
you
think
it
was
a
spell
then
sir
sure
of
it
old
jackson
simply
has
been
here
at
all
hill
thinks
he
been
broken
down
and
ill
and
somebody
else
is
poetical
and
says
his
star
never
shines
when
another
is
above
it
which
is
nonsense
and
somebody

malvern
hill
star
by
star
the
heavens
paled
the
dawn
came
faintly
and
mournfully
up
from
the
east
beneath
it
the
battlefield
of
frayser
farm
lay
hushed
and
motionless
like
the
sad
canvas
of
a
painter
the
tragic
dream
of
a
poet
it
was
far
flung
over
broken
ground
and
strewn
with
wrecks
of
war
dead
men
and
dying
very
many
of
them
for
the
fighting
had
been
heavy
lay
stretched
in
the
ghostly
light
and
beside
them
dead
and
dying
horses
eighteen
federal
guns
had
been
taken
they
rested
on
ridged
earth
black
against
the
cold
grey
sky
stark
and
silent
far
and
wide
rolled
the
field
beneath
the
cold
mysterious
changing
light
beside
the
dead
men
there
were
sleeping
troops
regiments
lying
on
their
arms
fallen
last
night
where
they
were
halted
slumbering
heavily
through
the
summer
night
as
the
sky
grew
purple
and
the
last
star
went
out
the
bugles
began
to
blow
the
living
men
rose
if
the
others
heard
a
reveille
it
was
in
far
countries
edward
cary
lying
down
in
the
darkness
near
one
of
the
guns
had
put
out
a
hand
and
touched
a
bedfellow
the
soldier
seemed
asleep
and
edward
slept
too
weary
enough
to
have
slept
in
hades
now
as
the
bugles
called
he
sat
up
and
looked
at
his
companion
who
did
not
rise
i
thought
you
lay
very
still
said
edward
he
sat
a
moment
on
the
dank
earth
beside
the
still
grey
figure
the
gun
stood
a
little
above
him
through
a
wheel
as
through
a
rose
window
he
saw
the
flush
of
dawn
the
dead
soldier
eyes
were
open
they
too
stared
through
the
at
the
dawn
edward
closed
them
i
never
could
take
death
seriously
he
said
which
is
fortunate
i
suppose
two
hours
later
his
regiment
moving
down
the
quaker
road
came
to
a
halt
before
a
small
pillared
country
church
a
group
of
officers
sat
their
horses
near
the
portico
lee
was
in
front
quiet
and
grand
out
of
the
cluster
warwick
cary
pushed
his
horse
across
to
the
halted
regiment
father
and
son
were
presently
holding
converse
beneath
a
dusty
roadside
cedar
i
am
thankful
to
see
you
said
edward
we
heard
of
the
great
charge
you
made
please
take
better
care
of
yourself
father
the
past
week
has
been
like
a
dream
answered
the
other
one
of
those
dreams
in
which
over
and
over
some
undertaking
vital
to
you
and
tremendous
is
about
to
march
then
over
and
over
comes
some
pettiest
obstacle
and
the
whole
vast
matter
is
turned
awry
yesterday
should
have
been
ours
yes
general
lee
had
planned
as
he
always
plans
we
should
have
crushed
mcclellan
instead
we
fought
alone
and
we
lost
four
thousand
men
and
though
we
made
the
enemy
lose
as
many
he
has
again
drawn
himself
out
of
our
grasp
and
is
before
us
i
think
that
we
will
have
a
fearful
fight
jackson
is
over
at
last
yes
close
behind
us
whiting
is
leading
i
saw
him
a
moment
there
a
report
that
one
of
the
stonewall
regiments
crossed
and
was
cut
in
pieces
late
yesterday
afternoon
i
hope
it
was
richard
i
hope
not
i
have
a
curious
boding
feeling
about
there
beat
your
drums
again
he
leaned
from
his
saddle
and
kissed
his
son
then
backed
his
horse
across
the
road
to
the
generals
by
the
pillared
church
the
regiment
marched
away
and
as
it
passed
it
cheered
general
lee
he
lifted
his
hat
thank
you
men
do
your
best
do
your
best
we
mind
you
marse
robert
we
mind
you
cried
the
troops
and
went
by
shouting
somewhere
down
the
quaker
road
the
word
malvern
hill
seemed
to
drop
from
the
skies
malvern
hill
malvern
hill
they
all
massed
on
malvern
hill
three
hundred
and
forty
guns
and
on
the
james
the
gunboats
malvern
hill
malvern
hill
malvern
hill
a
man
in
line
with
edward
described
the
place
my
last
year
at
william
and
mary
i
spent
christmas
at
westover
we
hunted
over
all
malvern
hill
it
rises
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
and
the
top
a
mile
across
about
the
base
there
are
thick
forests
and
swamps
and
turkey
creek
goes
winding
winding
to
the
james
you
see
the
james
the
wide
old
yellow
river
with
the
birds
going
screaming
overhead
there
were
no
gunboats
on
it
that
day
no
monitors
or
galenas
or
maritanzas
and
if
told
us
up
there
on
malvern
hill
that
the
next
time
we
climbed
it
at
westover
after
supper
they
told
indian
stories
and
stories
of
tarleton
troopers
and
in
the
night
we
listened
for
the
tap
of
evelyn
byrd
slipper
on
the
stair
we
said
we
heard
it
anyhow
we
did
hear
gunboats
and
three
hundred
pounders
only
beauty
eyes
did
rake
us
fore
and
aft
when
only
beaux
used
powder
and
cupid
was
the
shaft
sang
edward
fatal
was
the
war
and
pleasant
to
be
slain
beat
out
the
marching
feet
hill
malvern
hill
malvern
there
was
a
deep
wood
out
from
which
ran
like
spurs
shallow
ravines
clad
with
briar
and
bush
and
young
trees
there
was
a
stretch
of
rail
fence
and
there
was
a
wheat
field
where
the
grain
stood
in
shocks
because
of
the
smoke
however
nothing
could
be
seen
plainly
and
because
of
the
most
awful
sound
few
orders
were
distinctly
heard
evidently
officers
were
shouting
in
the
rents
of
the
veil
one
saw
waved
arms
open
mouths
gesticulations
with
swords
but
the
guns
spoke
by
the
score
and
the
blast
bore
the
human
voice
away
the
regiment
in
which
was
edward
cary
divined
an
order
and
ceased
firing
lying
flat
in
sedge
and
sassafras
while
a
brigade
from
the
rear
roared
by
edward
looked
at
his
fingers
barrel
burn
them
asked
a
neighbour
reckon
they
use
muskets
in
hell
wish
you
could
see
your
lips
edward
round
black
o
biting
cartridges
for
a
living
and
it
used
to
be
when
you
read
plutarch
that
you
were
all
for
the
peaceful
heroes
you
have
a
that
would
look
at
you
now
oh
take
those
lips
away
that
so
blackly
are
enshrined
here
comes
a
a
a
the
gunboats
on
the
river
threw
the
the
long
and
horrible
shells
arrived
with
a
noise
that
was
indescribable
a
thousand
shrieking
rockets
perhaps
with
at
the
end
an
explosion
and
a
rain
of
fragments
like
rocks
from
vesuvius
they
had
a
peculiar
faculty
for
getting
on
the
nerves
the
men
watched
their
coming
with
something
like
shrinking
with
raised
arms
and
narrowed
eyes
look
out
for
the
look
out
for
the
look
out
aaahhhh
before
long
the
regiment
was
moved
a
hundred
yards
nearer
the
here
it
became
entangled
in
the
ebb
of
a
charge
the
brigade
which
had
rushed
by
coming
back
piecemeal
broken
and
driven
by
an
iron
flail
it
would
reform
and
charge
again
but
now
there
was
confusion
all
the
field
was
confused
dismal
and
dreadful
beneath
the
smoke
the
smoke
rolled
and
billowed
a
curtain
of
strange
texture
now
parting
now
closing
and
when
it
parted
disclosing
immemorial
death
and
wounds
with
some
attendant
martial
pageantry
the
commands
were
split
as
by
wedges
the
uneven
ground
driving
them
asunder
and
the
belching
guns
they
went
up
to
hell
mouth
brigade
by
brigade
even
regiment
by
regiment
and
in
the
breaking
and
reforming
and
twilight
of
the
smoke
through
the
falling
of
officers
and
the
surging
to
and
fro
the
troops
became
interwoven
warp
of
one
division
woof
of
another
the
sound
was
shocking
when
now
and
then
there
fell
a
briefest
interval
it
was
as
though
the
world
had
stopped
had
fallen
into
a
gulf
of
silence
edward
cary
found
beside
him
a
man
from
another
regiment
a
small
slight
fellow
young
and
simple
a
shock
of
wheat
gave
both
a
protection
hot
work
said
edward
with
his
fine
camaraderie
you
made
a
beautiful
charge
we
almost
thought
you
would
take
them
the
other
looked
at
him
vacantly
i
added
up
figures
in
the
old
warehouse
he
said
in
a
high
thin
voice
i
added
up
figures
in
the
old
warehouse
and
when
i
went
home
at
night
i
used
to
read
plays
i
added
up
figures
in
the
old
warehouse
do
you
remember
hotspur
i
always
liked
him
and
that
part
pluck
bright
honour
from
the
moon
or
dive
into
the
bottom
of
the
deep
he
stood
up
edward
rose
to
his
knees
and
put
out
a
hand
to
draw
him
down
it
enough
to
make
you
crazy
i
confess
but
you
stand
up
like
that
the
downward
drawing
hand
was
too
late
there
were
blue
sharpshooters
in
a
wood
in
front
a
ball
entered
the
clerk
breast
and
he
sank
down
behind
the
wheat
i
added
up
figures
in
the
old
warehouse
he
again
told
cary
and
when
i
went
home
at
night
i
read
plays
the
figure
stiffened
in
edward
grasp
he
laid
it
down
and
from
behind
the
wheat
shock
watched
a
grey
battery
in
process
of
being
knocked
to
pieces
it
had
arrived
in
this
quarter
of
the
field
in
a
wild
gallop
and
with
a
happy
insouciance
had
unlimbered
and
run
up
the
guns
back
of
a
little
crest
topped
with
sumach
taking
pains
meanwhile
to
assure
the
infantry
that
now
it
was
safe
the
infantry
had
grinned
like
you
artillery
willing
to
bet
on
the
gunners
but
the
guns
are
a
small
and
few
do
know
that
we
feel
so
safe
the
grey
began
four
shells
flew
up
the
long
slope
and
burst
among
the
iron
rows
that
made
a
great
triple
crown
for
malvern
hill
the
grey
gunners
cheered
and
the
appreciative
infantry
cheered
and
the
first
began
to
reload
while
the
second
flat
in
scrub
and
behind
the
wheat
condescended
to
praise
artillery
does
just
about
as
well
as
can
be
expected
awful
arm
but
look
out
look
eeehhh
the
iron
crown
that
had
been
blazing
toward
other
points
of
the
compass
now
blazed
toward
this
adversity
came
to
the
insouciant
grey
battery
adversity
quickening
to
disaster
the
first
thunder
blast
thickened
to
a
howling
storm
of
shrapnel
grape
and
canister
at
the
first
gun
gunner
no
ramming
home
a
charge
was
blown
into
fragments
at
the
second
the
arm
holding
the
sponge
staff
was
severed
from
gunner
no
shoulder
a
great
shell
bursting
directly
over
the
third
killed
two
men
and
horribly
mangled
others
the
carriage
of
the
fourth
was
crushed
and
set
on
fire
this
in
the
beginning
of
the
storm
as
it
swelled
total
destruction
threatened
from
the
murk
the
captain
went
up
and
down
try
it
a
little
longer
men
try
it
a
little
longer
men
we
got
to
make
up
in
quality
you
know
we
got
to
make
up
in
quality
you
know
marse
robert
looking
i
see
him
over
there
try
it
a
little
longer
try
it
a
little
longer
an
aide
arrived
for
god
sake
take
what
you
got
left
away
yes
it
an
order
your
being
massacred
wo
help
look
out
look
no
one
in
battle
ever
took
account
of
time
or
saw
any
especial
reason
for
being
now
here
and
now
in
quite
a
different
place
or
ever
knew
exactly
how
the
places
had
been
exchanged
edward
was
practically
certain
that
he
had
taken
part
in
a
charge
that
his
brigade
had
driven
a
body
of
blue
infantry
from
a
piece
of
woods
at
any
rate
they
were
no
longer
in
the
wheat
field
but
in
a
shady
wood
where
severed
twigs
and
branches
floated
pleasantly
down
lying
flat
chin
on
hand
he
watched
a
regiment
storm
and
take
a
thick
abattis
felled
trees
filled
with
sharpshooters
masking
a
hastily
thrown
up
earthwork
the
regiment
was
reserving
its
fire
and
losing
heavily
an
elderly
man
led
it
riding
a
large
old
steady
horse
that
smith
said
the
regiment
in
the
wood
that
extra
billy
he
a
corker
next
time
he
runs
going
to
get
all
the
votes
the
regiment
tried
twice
to
pass
the
abattis
but
each
time
fell
back
the
brigadier
had
ordered
it
not
to
fire
until
it
was
past
the
trees
it
obeyed
but
sulkily
enough
men
were
dropping
the
went
down
there
was
an
outcry
colonel
we
ca
stand
this
we
all
get
killed
before
we
fire
a
shot
the
general
do
know
how
we
fixed
extra
billy
agreed
with
them
he
rose
in
his
stirrups
turned
and
nodded
vigorous
assent
of
course
you
ca
stand
it
boys
you
ought
to
be
expected
to
it
all
this
infernal
tactics
and
west
tomfoolery
damn
it
fire
and
flush
the
game
edward
laughed
from
the
fuss
it
was
apparent
that
the
abattis
and
earthwork
had
succumbed
at
any
rate
the
old
governor
and
his
regiment
were
gone
he
was
of
the
and
all
the
were
laughing
did
you
ever
see
him
go
into
battle
with
his
old
blue
umbrella
up
trotting
along
same
as
to
a
caucus
whole
constituency
following
fine
old
political
roman
look
out
yedward
whole
pine
tree
coming
down
the
scene
changed
again
and
it
was
the
side
of
a
ravine
with
a
fine
view
of
the
river
and
with
morell
and
couch
blazing
somewhere
above
the
shells
went
overhead
bellowing
monsters
charging
a
grey
battery
on
a
hillock
and
a
distant
line
of
troops
that
pegram
that
battery
said
some
one
he
does
well
has
any
one
any
idea
of
the
time
asked
another
sun
so
hidden
there
no
guessing
do
believe
we
ever
see
his
blessed
light
again
a
fisherman
from
the
eastern
shore
stated
that
it
was
nearly
five
fogs
ca
fool
me
day
drawing
down
and
tide
going
out
the
appeared
somebody
with
an
order
has
been
shot
coming
through
the
cornfield
toward
us
three
volunteers
to
bring
him
in
edward
and
the
eastern
shore
man
and
a
lean
and
dry
and
lawyer
from
king
and
queen
bent
their
heads
beneath
their
shoulders
and
plunged
into
the
corn
all
the
field
was
like
a
miniature
abattis
stalk
and
blade
shot
down
and
crossed
and
recrossed
in
the
wildest
tangle
to
make
way
over
it
was
difficult
enough
and
before
the
three
had
gone
ten
feet
the
minies
took
a
hand
the
wounded
courier
lay
beneath
his
horse
and
the
horse
screamed
twice
the
sound
rising
above
the
roar
of
the
guns
a
ball
pierced
edward
cap
another
drew
blood
from
the
lawyer
hand
the
fisherman
was
a
tall
and
wiry
man
as
he
ran
he
swayed
like
a
mast
in
storm
the
three
reached
the
courier
dragged
him
from
beneath
the
horse
and
found
both
legs
crushed
he
looked
at
them
with
lustreless
eyes
you
ca
do
anything
for
me
boys
the
general
says
please
try
to
take
those
three
guns
up
there
he
going
to
charge
the
line
beyond
and
they
are
in
the
way
all
right
we
will
said
the
lawyer
now
you
put
one
arm
round
neck
and
one
round
mine
but
the
courier
shook
his
head
you
leave
me
here
i
awful
tired
you
go
take
the
guns
instead
ai
no
use
i
tell
you
i
like
to
see
the
children
but
in
the
act
of
speaking
as
they
lifted
him
a
ball
went
through
his
throat
the
three
laid
the
body
down
and
heads
bent
between
shoulders
ran
over
and
through
the
corn
toward
the
ravine
two
thirds
of
the
way
across
the
fisherman
was
shot
he
came
to
his
knees
and
in
falling
clutched
edward
mast
overboard
he
cried
in
a
rattling
voice
cut
her
loose
damn
you
i
take
the
helm
he
too
died
cary
and
the
lawyer
got
back
to
the
gully
and
gave
the
order
the
taking
of
those
guns
was
no
simple
matter
it
resembled
child
play
only
in
the
and
close
attention
which
went
to
its
accomplishment
the
regiment
that
reached
them
at
last
and
took
them
and
took
what
was
left
of
the
blue
gunners
was
not
much
more
than
half
a
regiment
the
murk
up
here
on
this
was
thick
to
choking
the
odour
and
taste
of
the
battle
poisoned
brass
on
the
tongue
the
colour
that
of
a
sand
storm
the
heat
like
that
of
a
battleship
in
action
and
all
the
place
shook
from
the
thunder
and
recoil
of
the
tiers
of
great
guns
beyond
untaken
not
to
be
taken
a
regiment
rushed
out
of
the
rolling
smoke
by
the
half
regiment
mississippi
mississippi
well
even
mississippi
going
to
do
the
impossible
as
the
line
went
by
tall
and
swinging
and
yelling
itself
hoarse
the
colonel
was
wounded
and
fell
the
charge
went
on
while
the
officer
he
was
an
old
man
very
stately
looking
dragged
himself
aside
and
sitting
in
the
sedge
tied
a
large
bright
handkerchief
above
a
wound
in
his
leg
the
charge
dashed
itself
against
the
hillside
and
the
tier
of
guns
flamed
a
death
sickle
and
mowed
it
down
breathless
broken
the
regiment
fell
back
when
it
reached
the
old
man
with
the
bright
handkerchief
it
would
have
lifted
him
and
carried
him
with
it
to
the
rear
he
would
not
go
he
said
tell
the
they
ca
get
me
till
they
take
those
guns
the
mended
its
gaps
and
charged
again
the
old
man
set
his
hat
on
his
sword
waved
it
in
the
air
and
cheered
his
men
as
they
passed
they
passed
him
but
to
return
to
go
up
against
those
lines
of
bellowing
guns
was
mere
heroic
madness
bleeding
exhausted
the
men
put
out
their
hands
for
the
old
man
he
drew
his
revolver
i
shoot
anybody
who
touches
me
tell
the
they
ca
get
their
colonel
till
they
take
those
guns
the
charged
a
third
time
in
vain
it
came
back
a
part
of
it
came
back
the
old
man
had
fainted
and
his
men
lifted
and
bore
him
away
from
the
platform
where
he
lay
in
the
shadow
of
the
three
guns
edward
cary
looked
out
over
malvern
hill
the
encompassing
lowland
marsh
and
forest
and
fields
the
winding
turkey
creek
and
western
creek
and
to
the
south
the
james
a
wind
had
sprung
up
and
was
blowing
the
battle
smoke
hither
and
yon
here
it
hung
heavily
and
here
a
long
lane
was
opened
the
sun
was
low
and
red
behind
a
filmy
veil
dark
and
ragged
like
torn
crape
he
saw
four
gunboats
on
the
river
they
were
throwing
the
long
howling
shells
the
monitor
was
there
an
old
foe
the
cheese
box
on
a
shingle
edward
shut
his
eyes
and
saw
again
hampton
roads
and
how
the
monitor
had
looked
darting
from
behind
the
minnesota
the
old
turtle
the
old
merrimac
and
now
she
lay
a
charred
hull
far
far
beneath
the
james
by
craney
island
the
private
on
his
right
was
a
learned
man
edward
addressed
him
have
you
ever
thought
doctor
how
fearfully
dramatic
is
this
world
yes
it
one
of
those
facts
that
are
too
colossal
to
be
seen
shakespeare
says
all
the
world
a
stage
that
only
a
the
world
a
player
like
the
rest
of
us
below
this
niche
stretched
the
grey
above
it
on
the
hilltop
by
the
cannon
and
over
half
the
slope
beneath
spread
the
blue
a
forest
stood
behind
the
grey
out
of
it
came
the
troops
to
the
charge
the
flags
tossing
in
front
the
upward
reaching
fingers
of
coppice
and
brush
had
their
occupants
fragments
of
commands
under
cover
bands
of
sharpshooters
and
everywhere
over
the
open
raked
by
the
guns
were
dead
and
dying
men
they
lay
thickly
now
and
again
the
noise
of
the
torment
of
the
wounded
made
itself
heard
a
most
doleful
and
ghostly
sound
coming
up
like
a
wail
from
the
inferno
there
were
too
many
dead
or
dying
horses
others
still
unhurt
galloped
from
end
to
end
of
the
field
of
death
in
the
there
were
several
of
the
old
warriors
who
stood
and
ate
of
the
shocked
grain
there
arrived
a
hush
over
the
battlefield
one
of
those
pauses
which
occur
between
exhaustion
and
renewed
effort
effort
at
its
height
the
guns
fell
silent
the
musketry
died
away
the
gunboats
ceased
to
throw
those
great
shells
by
contrast
with
the
clangour
that
had
prevailed
the
stillness
seemed
that
of
a
desert
waste
a
dead
world
over
toward
a
there
could
be
made
out
three
figures
on
horseback
the
captain
of
edward
company
was
an
old
college
mate
lying
down
with
his
men
he
now
drew
himself
over
the
ground
and
loaned
cary
his
it
general
lee
and
general
jackson
and
general
h
hill
a
body
of
grey
troops
came
to
occupy
a
finger
of
woods
below
the
three
captured
guns
that
cary
legion
said
the
captain
here
comes
the
colonel
now
the
two
commands
were
but
a
few
yards
apart
fauquier
cary
dismounting
walked
up
the
sedgy
slope
and
asked
to
speak
to
his
nephew
the
latter
left
the
ranks
and
the
two
found
a
trampled
space
beside
one
of
the
great
pounders
a
dead
man
or
two
lay
in
the
parched
grass
but
there
was
nothing
else
to
disturb
the
quiet
yet
held
over
north
and
south
and
the
earth
that
gave
them
standing
room
i
have
but
a
moment
said
the
elder
man
this
is
but
the
hush
before
the
final
storm
we
came
by
jackson
troops
and
one
of
his
officers
whom
i
knew
at
the
point
rode
beside
me
a
little
way
they
all
crossed
white
oak
swamp
by
starlight
this
morning
and
apparently
jackson
is
again
the
jackson
of
the
valley
it
was
a
curious
eclipse
the
force
of
the
man
is
such
that
while
his
officers
acknowledge
the
eclipse
it
makes
no
difference
to
them
he
is
stonewall
jackson
and
that
suffices
but
that
is
not
what
i
have
to
tell
i
saw
father
a
moment
this
morning
he
said
there
was
a
rumour
about
one
of
the
stonewall
regiments
yes
it
was
the
cut
to
pieces
yes
richard
richard
was
not
killed
no
but
many
were
hairston
breckinridge
was
killed
and
some
of
the
thunder
run
men
and
very
many
others
almost
destroyed
carlton
said
they
crossed
at
sunset
there
were
a
swamp
and
a
wood
and
a
hollow
commanded
by
hills
the
enemy
was
in
force
behind
the
hill
and
there
was
beside
a
considerable
command
in
ambush
concealed
in
the
woods
by
the
swamp
these
had
a
gun
or
two
all
opened
on
the
it
was
cut
to
pieces
in
the
swamp
and
in
a
little
marshy
meadow
only
a
remnant
got
back
to
the
northern
side
of
the
creek
richard
is
under
arrest
he
was
acting
under
orders
so
carlton
says
he
says
but
general
jackson
says
there
was
no
such
order
that
he
disobeyed
the
order
that
was
given
and
now
tries
to
screen
himself
carlton
says
jackson
is
more
than
usual
and
we
know
how
it
fared
with
garnett
and
with
others
there
will
be
a
i
am
very
anxious
i
am
not
said
edward
stoutly
there
will
be
an
honourable
acquittal
we
must
write
and
tell
judith
that
she
not
to
worry
richard
cleave
did
nothing
that
he
should
not
have
done
of
course
we
know
that
but
carlton
says
that
on
the
face
of
it
an
ugly
affair
and
general
jackson
well
we
can
only
await
developments
poor
judith
and
his
sister
and
mother
poor
women
the
other
made
a
gesture
of
assent
and
sorrow
well
i
must
go
back
take
care
of
yourself
edward
there
will
be
the
devil
own
work
presently
he
went
and
edward
returned
to
his
fellows
the
silence
yet
held
over
the
field
the
westering
sun
glowed
dull
red
behind
the
smoke
the
three
figures
rested
still
by
the
the
mass
of
frowning
metal
topped
malvern
hill
like
a
giant
de
out
of
the
brushwood
to
the
left
of
the
regiment
straight
by
it
upward
towards
the
guns
and
then
at
a
tangent
off
through
the
fields
to
the
woods
sped
a
rabbit
legs
to
earth
it
hurried
with
all
its
might
the
regiment
was
glad
of
a
diversion
the
waiting
was
growing
so
intolerable
the
men
cheered
the
rabbit
go
it
molly
cottontail
go
it
molly
go
it
molly
hi
do
go
them
yankees
they
cut
your
head
off
go
way
that
it
go
it
molly
damn
was
for
my
character
i
go
with
you
the
rabbit
disappeared
the
regiment
settled
back
to
waiting
a
very
intolerable
employment
the
sun
dipped
lower
and
lower
the
hush
grew
portentous
the
guns
looked
old
mailed
dead
warriors
the
gunboats
sleeping
forms
the
grey
troops
in
a
great
war
picture
the
three
horsemen
by
the
a
significant
group
in
the
same
the
dead
and
wounded
over
all
the
fields
upon
the
slope
in
the
woods
by
the
marshes
the
jetsam
still
and
heavy
of
war
at
its
worst
for
a
moment
longer
the
wide
and
dreary
stretch
rested
so
then
with
a
wild
suddenness
sound
and
furious
motion
rushed
upon
the
scene
the
gunboats
recommenced
with
their
long
and
horrible
shells
a
grey
battery
opened
on
berdan
sharpshooters
strung
in
a
line
of
trees
below
the
great
crown
of
guns
the
crown
flamed
toward
the
battery
scorched
and
mangled
it
by
the
the
three
figures
separated
going
in
different
directions
presently
galloping
horses
aides
couriers
crossed
the
plane
of
vision
they
went
from
hill
in
the
centre
to
brigades
on
the
left
and
magruder
on
the
right
they
had
a
mile
of
open
to
cross
and
the
iron
crown
and
the
sharpshooters
flamed
against
them
some
galloped
on
and
gave
the
orders
some
threw
up
their
arms
and
fell
or
crashing
to
earth
with
a
wounded
horse
disentangled
themselves
and
stumbled
on
through
the
iron
rain
the
sun
drew
close
to
the
vast
and
melancholy
forests
across
the
river
through
a
rift
in
the
smoke
there
came
a
long
and
crimson
shaft
it
reddened
the
river
then
struck
across
the
shallows
to
malvern
hill
suffused
with
a
bloody
tinge
wood
and
field
and
the
marshes
by
the
creeks
then
splintered
against
the
hilltop
and
made
a
hundred
guns
to
gleam
the
wind
heightened
lifting
the
smoke
and
driving
it
northward
it
bared
to
the
last
red
light
the
wild
and
dreary
battlefield
from
the
centre
rose
the
confederate
yell
rodes
brigade
led
by
gordon
charged
it
had
half
a
mile
of
open
to
cross
and
it
was
caught
at
once
in
the
storm
that
howled
from
the
crest
of
malvern
hill
every
regiment
suffered
great
loss
the
alabama
saw
half
its
number
slain
or
wounded
the
men
yelled
again
and
sprang
on
in
the
teeth
of
the
storm
they
reached
the
slope
almost
below
the
guns
gordon
looked
behind
for
the
supporting
troops
which
hill
had
promised
they
were
coming
that
grim
fighter
leading
them
but
they
were
coming
far
off
under
clanging
difficulties
through
a
hell
of
shrapnel
rodes
brigade
alone
could
not
wrest
that
triple
crown
from
the
hilltop
no
not
if
the
men
had
been
giants
sons
of
anak
they
were
halted
they
lay
down
put
muskets
to
shoulder
and
fired
steadily
and
fired
again
on
the
blue
infantry
it
grew
darker
on
the
plain
brigades
were
coming
from
the
left
the
right
the
centre
there
had
been
orders
for
a
general
advance
perhaps
the
aides
carrying
them
were
among
the
slain
perhaps
this
perhaps
that
the
event
was
that
brigades
charged
singly
sometimes
even
regiments
crossed
with
a
cry
the
twilight
groaning
plain
and
charged
malvern
hill
unsupported
the
place
flamed
death
and
destruction
ten
thousand
men
pressed
forward
with
the
order
of
a
review
the
shot
and
shell
met
them
like
a
tornado
the
men
fell
by
hundreds
the
lines
closed
rushed
on
the
federal
infantry
joined
the
artillery
musketry
and
cannon
the
din
became
a
prolonged
and
fearful
roar
of
battle
the
sun
disappeared
there
sprang
out
in
the
western
sky
three
long
red
bands
of
clouds
on
the
darkening
slope
and
plain
hill
was
crushed
back
before
and
among
his
lines
a
horror
of
exploding

jackson
threw

had
rushed

the

in

and
again
the
ranks
closed
with
diminished
numbers
but
no
slackening
of
courage
the
grey
soldiers
again
dashed
themselves
against
malvern
hill
the
red
bars
in
the
west
faded
slowly
to
a
deep
purple
above
them
in
a
clear
space
of

showed
the
silver
venus
upon
her
cooling
globe
in
a
day
to
come
intelligent

might
rend
itself
as
here
the
old
horror
the
old
tragedy
the
old
stained
sublimity
over
again
all
the
drifting
smoke
was
now
red
lit
and
beneath
it
lay
in
their
blood
elderly
men
and
men
in
their
prime
and
young
men
very
many
oh
very
many
young
men
as
the
night
deepened
there
sprang
beneath
the
thunder
over
all
the
field
a
sound
like
wind
in
reeds
it
was
a
sighing
sound
a
low
and
grievous
sound
the
blue
lost
heavily
for
the
charges
were
wildly
heroic
but
the
guns
were
never
disabled
and
the
loss
of
the
grey
was
the
heaviest
brigade
by
brigade
the
grey
faced
the
storm
and
were
beaten
back
only
again
to
reel
forward
upon
the
slope
where
death
stood
and
swung
his
scythe

their

a
woman
allan
gold
lying
in
a
corner
of
the
stonewall
hospital
turned
his
head
toward
the
high
window
it
showed
him
little
merely
a
long
strip
of
blue
sky
above
housetops
the
window
was
open
and
the
noises
of
the
street
came
in
he
knew
them
checked
them
off
in
his
mind
he
was
doing
well
a
body
superbly
healthful
might
stand
out
boldly
against
a
minie
ball
or
two
just
as
calm
nerves
courage
and
serene
judgement
were
of
service
in
a
war
hospital
such
as
this
if
he
was
restless
now
it
was
because
he
was
wondering
about
christianna
it
was
an
hour
past
her
time
for
coming
the
ward
was
fearfully
crowded
this
however
was
the
end
by
the
stair
and
he
had
a
little
place
to
himself
many
in
the
ward
yet
lay
on
the
floor
on
a
blanket
as
he
had
done
that
first
morning
in
the
afternoon
of
that
day
a
wide
bench
had
been
brought
into
his
corner
a
thin
flock
mattress
laid
upon
it
and
he
himself
lifted
from
the
floor
he
had
protested
that
others
needed
a
bed
much
more
that
he
was
used
to
lying
on
the
earth
but
christianna
had
been
firm
he
wondered
why
she
did
not
come

farm
malvern
hill
dire
echoes
of
the
seven
days
fighting
had
thronged
into
this
hospital
as
into
all
others
as
into
the
houses
of
citizens
and
the
public
buildings
and
the
streets
all
manner
of
wounded
soldiers
told
the
story
ever
so
many
soldiers
and
ever
so
many
variants
of
the
story
the
dead
bore
witness
and
the
wailing
of
women
which
was
now
and
then
heard
in
the
streets
not
often
for
the
women
were
mostly
silent
with
pressed
lips
and
the
ambulances
jolting
by
and
the
sound
of
funerals
and
the
church
bells
tolling
tolling
all
these
bore
witness
and
day
and
night
there
was
the
thunder
of
the
cannon
from
mechanicsville
and
gaines
mill
it
had
rolled
near
and
loud
from
savage
station
somewhat
less
so
white
oak
swamp
and
frayser
farm
had
carried
the
sound
yet
further
off
and
from
malvern
hill
it
came
but
distantly
but
loud
or
low
near
or
far
day
by
day
and
into
each
night
richmond
heard
the
cannon
at
first
the
vibration
played
on
the
heart
like
a
giant
hand
on
giant
strings
but
at
last
the
tune
grew
old
and
the
town
went
about
its
business
there
was
so
much
to
do
one
could
not
stop
to
listen
to
cannon
richmond
was
a
vast
hospital
pain
and
fever
in
all
places
and
around
the
shadow
of
death
hardly
a
house
but
mourned
a
kinsman
or
kinsmen
early
and
late
the
dirges
wailed
through
the
streets
so
breathlessly
filled
were
the
days
that
often
the
dead
were
buried
at
night
the
weather
was
hot
days
and
nights
hot
close
and
still
men
and
women
went
swiftly
through
them
swift
and
direct
as
weavers
shuttles
privation
early
comrade
of
the
south
was
here
scant
room
scant
supplies
not
too
much
of
wholesome
food
for
the
crowded
town
few
medicines
or
alleviatives
much
to
be
done
and
done
at
once
with
the
inadequatest
means
there
was
little
time
in
which
to
think
in
general
terms
all
effort
must
go
toward
getting
done
the
immediate
thing
the
lift
and
tension
of
the
time
sloughed
off
the
immaterial
weak
act
or
thought
there
were
present
a
heroic
simplicity
a
naked
verity
a
full
cup
of
service
a
high
and
noble
altruism
the
plane
was
epic
and
the
people
did
well
the
sky
within
allan
range
of
vision
was
deep
blue
the
old
brick
of
houses
mellow
and
old
against
it
a
soldier
with
a
broken
leg
and
a
great
sabre
cut
over
the
head
just
brought
into
the
ward
brought
with
him
the
latest
news
he
talked
loudly
and
all
down
the
long
room
crowded
to
suffocation
the
less
desperately
wounded
raised
themselves
on
their
elbows
to
hear
others
shot
through
stomach
or
bowels
or
fearfully
torn
by
shells
or
with
the
stumps
of
amputated
limbs
not
doing
well
raved
on
in
delirium
or
kept
up
their
pitiful
moaning
the
soldier
raised
his
voice
higher
and
those
leaning
on
elbows
listened
with
avidity
evelington
heights
where
evelington
heights
between
westover
and

there
was
an
awful
noise
of
all
the
night
long
so
the
sentries

and
the
surgeons
and
the
wounded
and
i
reckon
the
generals

cold
pouring
rain
and
everywhere
there
were
dead
men
dead
men
dead
men
lying
there
in
the
wet
and
the
ambulances
were
wandering
round
like
ghosts
of
wagons
and
the
wood
was
too
dripping
to
make
a
fire
and
three
men
out
of
my
mess
were
killed
and
one
was
a
boy
that
we

yarn
every
time

want
me
to
the
ward
heard
no
more
about
evelington
heights
it
knew
however
that
it
had
been
no
great
affair
it
knew
that
mcclellan
with
his
exhausted
army
less
many
thousand
dead
wounded
and
prisoners
less
guns
and
thousand
small
arms
less
enormous
stores
captured
or
destroyed
less
some
confidence
at
washington
rested
down
the
james
by
westover
in
the
shadow
of
gunboats
the
ward
guessed
that
for
a
time
at
least
richmond
was
freed
from
the
northern
embrace
it
knew
that
lee
and
his
exhausted
army
less
even
more
of
dead
and
wounded
than
had
fallen
on
the
other
side
rested
between
that
enemy
and
richmond
lee
was
watching
the
enemy
would
come
no
nearer
for
this
while
for
all
its
pain
for
all
the
heat
the
blood
the
fever
thirst
and
woe
the
ward
the
hospital
all
the
hospitals
experienced
a
sense
of
triumph
it
was
so
with
the
whole
city
allan
knew
this
lying
looking
with
eyes
at
the
blue
summer
sky
and
the
old
and
mellow
roofs
the
city
mourned
but
also
it
rejoiced
there
stretched
the
black
thread
but
twisted
with
it
was
the
gold
a
paean
sounded
as
well
as
a
dirge
seven
days
and
nights
of
smoke
and
glare
upon
the
horizon
of
the
cannon
roar
of
the
pouring
in
of
the
wounded
of
processions
to
hollywood
of
anguish
ceaseless
labour
sick
waiting
dizzy
hope
descending
despair
now
at
last
above
it
all
the
bells
rang
for
victory
a
young
girl
coming
through
the
ward
had
an
armful
of
flowers
white
lilies
citron
aloes
mignonette
and
phlox
she
gave
her
posies
to
all
who
stretched
out
a
hand
and
went
out
with
her
smiling
face
allan
held
a
great
stalk
of
garden
phlox
white
and
sweet
it
carried
him
back
to
the
tollgate
and
to
the
log
schoolhouse
by
thunder
run
twelve
was
not
christianna
coming
at
all
this
was
not
judith
cary
ward
but
now
she
entered
it
allan
watching
the
narrow
path
between
the
wounded
saw
her
coming
from
the
far
door
he
did
not
know
who
she
was
he
only
looked
from
the
flower
in
his
hand
and
had
a
sense
of
strength
and
sweetness
of
something
noble
approaching
nearer
she
paused
to
ask
a
question
of
one
of
the
women
answered
she
came
straight
on
he
saw
that
she
was
coming
to
the
corner
by
the
stair
and
instinctively
he
straightened
a
little
the
covering
over
him
in
a
moment
she
was
standing
beside
him
in
her
cool
hospital
dress
with
her
dark
hair
knotted
low
with
a
flower
at
her
breast
you
are
allan
gold
she
said
yes
my
name
is
judith
cary
perhaps
you
have
heard
of
me
i
have
been
to
lauderdale
and
to
three
oaks
yes
said
allan
i
have
heard
of
you
i
there
was
an
empty
box
beside
the
wall
judith
drew
it
nearer
to
his
bed
and
sat
down
you
have
been
looking
for
christianna
i
came
to
tell
you
about
poor
little
christianna
and
and
other
things
father
has
been
killed
allan
uttered
an
exclamation
isham
maydew
i
never
thought
of
his
going
poor
child
so
she
thought
she
ought
not
to
come
had
there
been
strong
reason
many
people
dependent
upon
her
she
would
have
come
poor
christianna
poor
wild
rose
it
ghastly
this
war
there
is
nothing
too
small
and
harmless
for
its
grist
i
agree
with
you
nothing
too
great
nothing
too
small
nothing
too
base
as
there
is
nothing
too
noble
isham
maydew
he
was
lean
and
tough
and
still
like
death
in
a
picture
where
was
he
killed
it
was
at
white
oak
swamp
at
white
oak
swamp
the
day
before
malvern
hill
allan
looked
at
her
there
was
more
in
her
voice
than
the
of
christianna
than
the
death
of
isham
maydew
she
had
spoken
in
a
clear
low
tone
that
held
somehow
the
ache
of
the
world
he
was
simple
and
direct
and
he
spoke
at
once
out
of
his
thought
he
knew
that
all
the
men
of
her
house
were
at
the
front
you
have
had
a
loss
of
your
own
she
shook
her
head
i
no
i
have
had
no
loss
now
thought
allan
there
something
proud
in
it
he
looked
at
her
with
his
kindly
eyes
in
some
chamber
of
the
brain
there
flashed
out
a
picture
the
day
of
the
botetourt
resolutions
winter
dusk
after
winter
sunset
and
cleave
and
himself
going
homeward
over
the
long
hilltop
with
talk
among
other
things
of
visitors
at
lauderdale
this
was
the
beautiful
one
he
remembered
the
lift
of
cleave
head
and
his
voice
judith
large
dark
eyes
had
been
raised
transparent
showing
always
the
soul
within
as
did
his
own
they
now
met
allan
the
she
said
was
cut
to
pieces
the
words
dragged
out
as
they
were
left
a
shocked
silence
here
in
the
corner
by
the
stair
the
arch
of
wood
partially
obscuring
the
ward
with
the
still
blue
sky
and
the
still
brick
gables
they
seemed
for
the
moment
cut
away
from
the
world
met
on
desert
sands
to
tell
and
hear
a
dreadful
thing
cut
to
pieces
breathed
allan
the
cut
to
pieces
the
movement
which
he
made
displaced
the
bandage
about
his
shoulder
she
left
the
box
kneeled
by
him
and
straightened
matters
then
went
back
to
her
seat
it
was
this
way
she
said
and
told
him
the
story
as
she
had
heard
it
from
her
father
and
from
fauquier
cary
she
spoke
with
simplicity
in
the
low
tone
that
held
the
ache
of
the
world
allan
listened
with
his
hand
over
his
eyes
his
regiment
that
he
loved
all
the
old
familiar
faces
yes
he
was
killed
hairston
breckinridge
was
killed
fighting
gallantly
he
died
they
say
before
he
knew
the
trap
they
were
caught
in
and
christianna
father
was
killed
and
others
of
the
thunder
run
men
and
very
many
from
the
county
and
from
other
counties
i
do
not
know
how
many
fauquier
called
it
slaughter
said
no
worse
thing
has
happened
to
any
single
command
richard
got
what
was
left
back
across
the
swamp
allan
groaned
the
general
jackson
himself
called
it
fighting
just
a
remnant
of
it
left
left
of
the
yes
the
roll
was
called
and
so
many
did
not
answer
they
say
other
stonewall
regiments
wept
allan
raised
himself
upon
the
bench
she
started
forward
do
do
that
and
with
her
hand
pressed
him
gently
down
again
i
knew
she
said
that
you
were
here
and
i
have
heard
richard
speak
of
you
and
say
how
good
and
likable
you
were
and
i
have
worked
hard
all
the
morning
and
just
now
i
thought
must
speak
to
some
one
who
knows
and
loves
him
or
i
will
die
and
so
i
came
i
knew
that
the
ward
might
hear
of
the
any
moment
now
and
begin
to
talk
of
it
so
i
was
not
afraid
of
hurting
you
but
you
must
lie
quiet
very
well
i
will
i
want
to
know
about
richard
cleave
about
my
colonel
her
dark
eyes
met
the
ones
fully
he
is
under
arrest
she
said
general
jackson
has
preferred
charges
against
him
charges
of
what
of
disobedience
to
orders
of
sacrificing
the
regiment
of
of
retreating
at
last
when
he
should
not
have
done
so
and
leaving
his
men
to
perish
of
of
i
have
seen
a
copy
of
the
charge
the
said
colonel
of
the
did
her
voice
broke
oh
if
i
were
god
there
was
a
moment
silence
silence
here
in
the
corner
by
the
stair
though
none
beyond
in
the
painful
moaning
ward
a
bird
sailed
across
the
strip
of
blue
sky
the
stalk
of
phlox
on
the
soldier
narrow
bed
lay
withering
in
the
light
allan
spoke
general
jackson
is
very
stern
with
failure
he
may
believe
that
charge
i
do
see
how
he
can
but
if
he
made
it
he
believes
it
but
you
you
do
believe
it
believe
it
she
said
no
more
than
god
believes
it
the
question
is
now
how
to
help
richard
have
you
heard
from
him
she
took
from
her
dress
a
folded
leaf
torn
from
a
you
are
his
friend
you
may
read
it
wait
i
will
hold
it
she
laid
it
before
him
holding
it
in
her
slight
fine
strong
fingers
he
read
you
will
hear
of
the
fate
of
the
how
it
happened
i
do
not
yet
understand
it
is
like
death
on
my
heart
you
will
hear
too
of
my
own
trouble
as
to
me
believe
only
that
i
could
sit
beside
you
and
talk
as
we
talked
awhile
ago
in
the
sunset
she
refolded
the
paper
and
put
it
back
the
evidence
will
clear
him
said
allan
it
must
the
very
doubt
is
absurd
her
face
lightened
general
jackson
will
see
that
he
was
hasty
unjust
i
can
understand
such
anger
at
first
but
later
when
he
reflects
richard
will
be
declared
innocent
yes
an
honourable
acquittal
it
will
surely
be
so
i
am
glad
i
came
you
have
always
known
him
and
been
his
friend
let
me
tell
you
the
kind
of
things
i
know
of
richard
cleave
no
it
does
hurt
me
to
talk
i
can
stay
a
little
longer
yes
tell
me
allan
spoke
at
some
length
in
his
frank
quiet
voice
she
sat
beside
him
with
her
cheek
on
her
hand
the
blue
sky
and
old
house
roofs
above
her
when
he
ceased
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
she
would
not
let
them
fall
if
i
began
to
cry
i
should
never
stop
she
said
and
smiled
them
away
presently
she
rose
i
must
go
now
christianna
will
be
back
she
went
away
passing
up
the
narrow
path
between
the
wounded
and
out
at
the
further
door
allan
watched
her
going
then
turned
a
little
on
the
flock
bed
and
lifting
his
unbandaged
arm
laid
it
across
his
eyes
cut
to
pieces
the
cut
to
pieces
at
sunset
judith
went
home
the
small
room
up
in
the
branches
of
the
tulip
tree
she
hardly
knew
how
many
months
or
years
she
had
inhabited
it
there
had
passed
of
course
only
weeks
but
time
had
widened
its
measure
to
all
intents
and
purposes
she
had
been
a
long
while
in
richmond
this
high
quiet
niche
was
familiar
familiar
familiar
the
old
slender
inlaid
and
the
long
thin
curtains
and
the
engraving
of
charlotte
corday
familiar
the
cool
green
tree
without
the
window
and
the
nest
upon
a
bough
familiar
the
far
view
and
wide
horizon
by
day
by
night
the
smoke
was
lifted
now
the
eye
saw
further
than
it
had
seen
for
days
the
room
seemed
as
quiet
as
a
tomb
for
a
moment
the
silence
oppressed
her
and
then
she
remembered
that
it
was
because
the
cannon
had
stopped
she
sat
beside
the
window
through
the
dusk
until
the
stars
came
out
then
went
downstairs
and
took
her
part
at
the
table
about
which
the
soldier
sons
of
the
house
were
gathering
they
brought
comrades
with
them
the
wounded
eldest
son
was
doing
well
the
army
was
victorious
the
siege
was
lifted
the
house
must
be
made
gay
for
the
boys
no
house
was
ever
less
bright
for
judith
now
she
smiled
and
listened
and
the
young
men
thought
she
did
not
realize
the
seriousness
of
the
army
talk
about
the
they
themselves
were
careful
not
to
mention
the
matter
they
talked
of
a
thousand
heroisms
a
thousand
incidents
of
the
seven
days
but
they
turned
the
talk
if
any
one
unwary
drew
it
that
way
from
white
oak
swamp
they
mistook
her
feeling
she
would
rather
they
had
spoken
out
her
comfort
was
when
afterwards
she
went
for
a
moment
into
the
chamber
to
see
the
wounded
eldest
he
was
a
rough
diamond
fond
of
his
cousin
what

damned
stuff

finding
le
vicomte
de
bragelonne
face
down
on
the
counterpane

to
read
to
him
you
would
rather
talk
about
richard
he
said
i
know
you
would
so

i
it
all
the
damnedest

a
charge
as
that

it
well
stonewall
jackson

cromwell

course

nobler
cause
but
still

to
listen
to
the
truth
he
did
it
and
so
will
stonewall
jackson
such
damned
stuff
and
nonsense
it
hurts
me
worse
than
that
old
bayonet
jab

could
i
like
to
hear
what
edward

he
says

the
stupidest
beast
yes
it
is
cousin
margaret
with
richard

she
not
with
him
that
could
be
they
said
but
she
and
miriam
have
gone
to
merry
mount
it
in
the
lines
i
have
had
a
note
from
her
what
did
she
say
you
do
mind
judith
no
rob
i
do
mind
it
was
just
a
verse
from
a
psalm
she
said
had
fainted
unless
i
had
believed
to
see
the
goodness
of
the
lord
in
the
land
of
the
living
be
of
good
courage
and
he
shall
strengthen
thy
later
in
her
room
again
she
sat
by
the
window
through
the
greater
part
of
the
night
the
stars
were
large
and
soft
the
airs
faint
the
jasmine
in
the
garden
below
smelled
sweet
the
hospital
day
stretched
before
her
she
must
sleep
so
that
she
could
work
she
never
thought
in
that
city
and
time
no
woman
thought
of
ceasing
from
service
because
of
private
grief
moreover
work
was
her
salvation
she
would
be
betimes
at
the
hospital
and
she
would
leave
it
late
she
bent
once
more
a
long
look
upon
the
east
where
were
the
of
lee
and
stonewall
jackson
in
imagination
she
passed
the
sentries
she
moved
among
the
sleeping
brigades
she
found
one
tent
or
perhaps
it
would
be
instead
a
rude
cabin
she
stretched
her
arms
upon
the
and
they
and
her
thick
fallen
hair
were
wet
at
last
with
her
tears
three
days
passed
on
the
third
afternoon
she
left
the
hospital
early
and
went
to
paul
she
chose
again
the
dusk
beneath
the
gallery
and
she
prayed
dumbly
fiercely
o
god
o
god
the
church
was
fairly
filled
the
grey
army
was
now
but
a
little
way
without
the
city
it
had
come
back
to
the
seven
hills
after
the
seven
days
it
had
come
back
the
hero
the
darling
richmond
took
the
cypress
from
her
doors
put
off
the
purple
pall
and
tragic
mask
last
july
richmond
was
to
fall
and
this
july
richmond
was
to
fall
and
lo
she
sat
secure
on
her
seven
hills
and
her
sons
did
her
honour
and
for
them
she
would
have
made
herself
a
waste
place
she
yet
toiled
and
watched
yet
mourned
for
the
dead
and
hung
over
the
beds
of
the
wounded
and
more
and
more
she
wondered
whence
were
to
appear
the
next
day
yard
of
cloth
and
measure
of
flour
but
in
these
days
she
overlaid
her
life
with
gladness
and
made
her
house
pleasant
for
her
sons
the
service
at
paul
this
afternoon
was
one
of
thankfulness
the
hymns
rang
triumphantly
there
were
many
soldiers
two
officers
came
in
together
judith
knew
general
lee
but
the
other
in
a
moment
she
saw
that
it
was
general
jackson
her
heart
beat
to
suffocation
she
sank
down
in
the
gold
dusk
of
her
corner
o
god
let
him
see
the
truth
o
god
let
him
see
the
truth
outside
as
she
went
homeward
in
the
red
sunset
she
paused
for
a
moment
to
speak
to
an
old
free
negro
who
was
begging
for
alms
she
gave
him
something
and
when
he
had
shambled
on
she
stood
still
a
moment
here
at
the
corner
of
the
street
with
her
eyes
upon
the
beautiful
rosy
west
there
was
a
garden
wall
behind
her
and
a
tall
crape
myrtle
as
she
stood
with
the
light
upon
her
face
maury
stafford
rode
by
he
saw
her
as
she
saw
him
his
brooding
face
flushed
he
made
as
if
to
check
his
horse
but
did
not
so
he
lifted
his
hat
high
and
rode
on
out
of
the
town
back
to
the
encamped
army
judith
had
made
no
answering
motion
she
stood
with
lifted
face
and
unchanged
look
the
rosy
light
flooding
her
the
rosy
tree
behind
her
when
he
was
gone
she
shivered
a
little
it
is
not
happiness
that
hates
it
is
misery
she
thought
when
i
was
happy
i
never
felt
like
this
i
hate
him
he
is
of
peril
that
night
she
did
not
sleep
at
all
but
sat
bowed
together
in
the
window
her
arms
about
her
knees
her
forehead
upon
them
and
her
dark
hair
loose
about
her
she
sat
like
a
sibyl
till
the
dawn
then
rose
and
bathed
and
dressed
and
was
at
the
hospital
earliest
of
all
the
workers
of
that
day
in
the
evening
again
just
at
dusk
she
reentered
the
room
and
presently
again
took
her
seat
by
the
window
the
red
light
of
the
was
beginning
to
show
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
judith
rose
and
opened
to
a
turbaned
coloured
girl
yes
dilsey
miss
judith
de
air
downstairs
he
say
ax
you
kin
he
come
up
to
yo
room
yes
yes
dilsey
tell
him
to
come
when
her
father
came
he
found
her
standing
against
the
wall
her
hands
outstretched
behind
her
resting
on
it
the
last
soft
bloom
of
day
was
upon
her
indefinably
with
her
hands
so
the
wall
behind
her
and
her
lifted
head
she
looked
a
soldier
facing
a
firing
party
tell
me
quickly
she
said
the
exact
truth
warwick
gary
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
came
toward
her
the
court
found
him
guilty
judith
as
she
still
stood
the
light
from
without
upon
her
face
he
took
her
in
his
arms
drew
her
from
the
wall
and
made
her
sit
in
the
chair
by
the
window
then
placed
himself
beside
her
and
leaning
over
took
her
hands
in
his
strong
clasp
many
a
court
has
found
many
a
man
guilty
judith
whom
his
own
soul
cleared
that
is
true
she
answered
your
own
judgment
has
not
changed
no
judith
no
she
lifted
his
hand
and
kissed
it
just
a
moment
and
then
you
tell
me
they
sat
still
in
the
soft
summer
air
the
stars
were
coming
out
off
to
the
east
showed
the
long
red
light
where
was
the
army
judith
eyes
rested
here
he
saw
it
and
saw
presently
courage
lift
into
her
face
it
came
steady
with
a
deathless
look
now
she
said
and
loosed
her
hands
it
is
very
bad
he
answered
slowly
the
evidence
was
more
adverse
than
i
could
have
dreamed
only
on
the
last
count
was
there
acquittal
the
last
count
the
charge
of
personal
cowardice
her
eyelids
trembled
a
little
i
am
glad
she
said
that
they
had
a
gleam
of
reason
the
other
uttered
a
short
laugh
proud
and
troubled
yes
it
would
not
have
occurred
to
me
just
that
accusation
well
he
stood
cleared
of
that
but
the
other
charges
judith
the
others
he
rested
his
hands
on
his
sword
hilt
and
gazed
broodingly
into
the
deepening
night
the
court
could
only
find
as
it
did
i
myself
sitting
there
listening
to
that
testimony
it
is
inexplicable
tell
me
all
general
jackson
order
was
plain
a
staff
officer
carried
it
to
general
winder
with
perfect
correctness
winder
repeated
it
to
the
court
and
word
for
word
jackson
corroborated
it
the
same
officer
carrying
it
on
from
winder
to
the
came
up
with
a
courier
belonging
to
the
regiment
to
this
man
an
educated
reliable
trusted
soldier
he
gave
the
order
he
should
not
have
done
so
it
is
easy
to
say
that
to
blame
because
this
time
there
a
snarl
to
unravel
the
thing
is
done
often
enough
it
should
not
be
done
but
it
is
staff
service
with
us
is
far
too
irregular
the
officer
stands
to
receive
a
severe
reprimand
but
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
he
did
not
give
the
order
to
the
courier
with
all
the
accuracy
with
which
he
had
already
delivered
it
to
winder
he
testified
that
he
did
so
give
it
repeated
it
word
for
word
to
the
court
he
entrusted
it
to
the
courier
taking
the
precaution
to
make
the
latter
say
it
over
to
him
and
then
he
returned
to
general
jackson
down
the
stream
before
the
bridge
they
were
building
that
closed
his
testimony
he
received
the
censure
of
the
court
but
what
he
did
has
been
done
before
the
courier
testified
no
that
is
the
link
that
drops
out
the
courier
was
killed
a
thunder
run
man
steven
dagg
testified
that
he
had
been
separated
from
the
regiment
returning
to
it
along
the
wooded
bank
of
the
creek
he
arrived
just
behind
the
courier
he
heard
him
give
the
order
to
the
colonel
he
repeat
it
he
did
so
and
it
was
accurately
jackson
order
richard
what
did
richard
say
he
said
the
man
lied
ah
the
courier
fell
before
the
first
volley
from
the
troops
in
the
woods
he
died
almost
at
once
but
two
men
testified
as
to
the
only
thing
he
had
said
it
was
ought
never
all
of
us
to
have
crossed
tell
old
jack
i
carried
the
order
straight
he
rose
and
with
a
restless
sigh
began
to
pace
the
little
room
i
see
a
tangle
something
not
understood
some
laid
by
laws
beyond
our
vision
we
can
not
even
define
it
can
not
even
find
its
edges
we
do
not
know
its
nature
things
happen
so
sometimes
in
this
strange
world
i
do
not
think
that
richard
himself
understands
how
the
thing
chanced
he
testified
yes
oh
yes
he
repeated
to
the
court
the
order
he
had
received
it
was
not
the
order
that
jackson
had
given
and
that
winder
had
sent
on
to
him
though
it
differed
in
only
two
points
and
neither
and
there
judith
there
is
a
trouble
neither
was
it
with
entire
explicitness
an
order
to
do
that
which
he
did
do
he
acknowledged
that
quite
simply
he
had
found
at
the
time
an
ambiguity
he
had
thought
of
sending
again
for
confirmation
to
winder
and
then
unfortunate
man
something
happened
to
strengthen
the
interpretation
which
when
all
is
said
he
preferred
to
receive
and
upon
which
he
acted
time
pressed
he
took
the
risk
if
there
was
a
risk
and
crossed
the
stream
father
do
you
blame
him
he
blames
himself
judith
somewhat
cruelly
but
i
think
it
is
because
just
now
of
the
agony
of
memory
he
loved
his
no
what
sense
in
blaming
where
had
there
followed
success
you
would
have
praised
then
it
would
have
been
proper
daring
now
i
could
say
that
he
had
been
wiser
to
wait
but
i
do
not
know
that
in
his
place
i
should
have
waited
he
was
rash
perhaps
but
who
is
there
to
tell
had
he
chosen
another
interpretation
and
delayed
and
been
mistaken
then
too
commination
would
have
fallen
no
i
blame
him
less
than
he
blames
himself
judith
but
the
fact
remains
even
by
his
own
showing
there
was
a
doubt
even
accepting
his
statement
of
the
order
he
received
he
took
it
upon
himself
to
decide
they
did
not
accept
his
statement
no
judith
they
judged
that
he
had
received
general
jackson
order
and
had
disobeyed
i
know
i
know
to
us
it
is
monstrous
but
the
court
must
judge
by
the
evidence
and
the
verdict
was
to
be
expected
it
was
his
sole
word
and
where
his
own
safety
was
at
stake
not
the
dead
courier
a
reputation
for
reliability
for
accuracy
had
and
he
would
not
lay
the
blame
there
besmirching
a
brave
man
name
then
did
not
know
it
was
so
that
he
had
received
the
order
judith
judith
i
have
rarely
seen
truth
so
helpless
as
in
this
case
she
drew
a
difficult
breath
no
help
and
they
said
he
was
pronounced
guilty
of
the
first
charge
that
carried
with
it
the
verdict
as
to
the
second
the
sacrifice
of
the
regiment
there
too
guilty
only
the
third
there
was
no
sustaining
the
loss
was
fearful
but
there
were
men
enough
left
to
clear
him
from
that
charge
he
struggled
with
desperation
to
retrieve
his
error
if
error
it
were
he
escaped
death
himself
as
by
a
miracle
and
he
brought
off
a
remnant
of
the
command
which
in
weaker
hands
might
have
been
utterly
swallowed
up
on
that
count
he
is
clear
but
on
the
others
guilty
and
without
mitigation
he
came
back
to
the
woman
by
the
window

rather
put

into
the
night
her
gaze
went
straight
to
the

light
in

there
was
an
effect
as
though
the
force
impalpable
real
which
was
herself
had
gone
too
flown
from
the
window
straight
toward
that
horizon
leaving
here
but
a
fair
ivory
shell
it
was
but
momentary
the
chains
held
and
she
turned
back
to

seen
him
yes
how
he
has
much
of
his
mother
in
him
judith
eventually
he
will
i
think
take
it
that
way
but
now
it
is
his
father
that
shows
he
is
very
silent
grey
and
hard
and
silent
where
is
he
at
present
yet
under
guard
it
will
all
be
over
he
will
be
free
you
mean
yes
he
will
be
free
she
came
and
put
her

around
her

neck
father
you
know
what
i
want
to
do
then
to
do
just
as
soon
as
i
shall
have
seen
him
and
made
him
realize
that
it
is
for
my
happiness
i
want
to
marry
him
ah
do
look
at
me
so
saying
nothing
she
withdrew
herself
a
little
standing
with
her
clasped
hands
against
his
breast
you
expected
that
did
you
not
why
what
else
father
i
am
not
afraid
of
you
you
will
let
me
do
it
he
regarded
her
with
a
grave
compassionate
face
no
you
need
not
fear
me
judith
it
is
hardly
father
and
child
with
you
and
me
it
is
soul
and
soul
and
i
trust
your
soul
with
its
own
concerns
moreover
if
it
is
pain
to
consider
what
you
would
do
the
pang
would
be
greater
to
find
you
not
capable
yes
i
would
let
you
do
it

not

not

too
were

they
were
the
wonder
was
that
the
creatures
could
fight
even
it
appeared
fight
to
effect
around
and
over
the

the

grew
to

that
there
must

in

gift
of

all
was
seen
confusedly
but
with
a
mounting
mounting
interest
the
world
gaped
at
the
clang
and
smoke
and
roar
military
men
in
clubs
demonstrated
to
a
nicety
just
how
long
the
fortress
might
hold
out
and
just
how
it
must
be
taken

armies
of

what
to
do
with
mcclellan
at
present
summering
on
the
james
miles
below
richmond
came
upon
the
board
mcclellan
claimed
quite
rightly
that
here
and
now
with
his
army
on
both
sides
of
the
james
he
held
the
key
position
and
that
with
sufficient
reinforcements
he
could
force
the
evacuation
of
richmond
only
give
him
reinforcements
with
which
to
face
lee
not
less
than
two
hundred
thousand
recall
the
army
of
the
potomac
and
it
might
be

pope
had
come
out
of
the

to
take

command
of

mcdowell
he
had
an
attitude
had

at
the

forty
thousand
men
behind

the
armies
were
too
widely
separated
mcclellan
location
notoriously
unhealthy
impossible
to
furnish
reinforcements
to
the
tune
asked
for
washington
might
at
any
moment
be
in
peril
it
was
understood
that
stonewall
jackson
had
left
richmond
on
the
thirteenth
marching
toward
gordonsville
the
james
river
might
be
somewhat
unhealthy
for
strangers
that
summer
and
stonewall
jackson
had
marched
toward
gordonsville
the
desire
at
the
moment
most
at
the
heart
of
general
robert
edward
lee
was
that
general
mcclellan
should
be
recalled
therefore
he
guarded
richmond
with
something
less
than
sixty
thousand
men
and
he
made
rumours
to
spread
of
gunboats
building
and
he
sent
jackson
northward
with
twelve
thousand
men
in
this
july
month
there
was
an
effect
of
suspense
the
fortress
was
taking
muster
telling
its
strength
soldering
its
flag
to
the
staff
and
the
staff
to
the
keep
the
besiegers
were
gathering
the
world
was
watching
expectant
of
the
grimmer
struggle
there
came
a
roar
and
clang
from
the
outer
walls
from
the
mississippi
above
vicksburg
from
the
georgian
coast
from
murfreesboro
in
tennessee
from
arkansas
from
morgan
raids
in
kentucky
there
was
fire
and
sound
enough
but
the
battles
that
were
to
tell
were
looked
for
on
virginia
soil
hot
and
still
were
the
july
days
hot
and
still
was
the
air
and
charged
with
a
certain
sentiment
thunderbolts
were
forging
all
concerned
knew
that
and
very
subtly
life
and
death
and
the
blue
sky
and
the
green
leaves
came
freshlier
across
the
senses
jackson
arriving
at
gordonsville
the
nineteenth
of
july
found
pope
before
him
with
thousand
men
he
asked
for
reinforcements
and
lee
detaching
yet
another
twelve
thousand
from
the
army
at
richmond
sent
him
hill
and
the
light
division
hill
arrived
on
the
second
of
august
splendid
fighter
in
his
hunting
shirt
with
his
red
beard
that
evening
in
jackson
quarters
some
one
showed
him
a
captured
copy
of
pope
orders
numbers
and
he
read
crumpled
the
papers
and
tossed
them
aside
then
turned
to
jackson
sitting
sucking
a
lemon
well
general
here
a
new
candidate
for
your
attention
jackson
looked
up
yes
sir
by
god
blessing
he
shall
have
it
he
sucked
on
studying
a
map
of
the
country
between
slaughter
mountain
and
manassas
which
hotchkiss
had
made
him
in
a
letter
to
his
wife
from
richmond
he
had
spoken
of
fever
and
debility
attending
him
during
his
stay
in
that
section
of
the
country
if
it
were
so
he
had
apparently
left
them
in
the
rear
when
he
came
up
here
he
sat
now
tranquil
as
a
stone
wall
in
sight
of
the
mountains
sucking
his
lemon
and
studying
his
maps
this
was
the
second
on
the
sixth
of
august
pope
began
to
cross
the
rappahannock
on
the
afternoon
of
the
seventh
the
grey
army
was
in
motion
all
the
eighth
it
was
in
column
the
heat
intense
the
dust
stifling
an
entanglement
of
trains
and
a
misunderstanding
of
orders
on
the
part
of
hill
and
ewell
resulting
in
a
confused
and
retarded
march
night
fell
hot
and
breathless
thousand
grey
soldiers
moving
toward
orange
court
house
made
the
dark
road
vocal
with
statements
as
to
the
reeking
heat
the
dust
the
condition
of
their
shoes
and
the
impertinence
of
the
cavalry
the
latter
was
more
irritating
than
were
the
flapping
soles
the
dust
in
the
throat
and
the
sweat
pouring
into
the
eyes
the
infantry
swore
swerving
again
and
again
to
one
side
of
the
narrow
road
to
let
small
bodies
of
horsemen
go
by
it
was
dark
the
road
going
through
an
interminable
hot
close
wood
officers
and
men
were
liberal
in
their
vituperation
thank
the
lord
it
ai
my
arm
here
you
fellows
damn
you
look
where
you
are
going
trampling
innocent
bystanders
that
way
why
in
hell
did
you
stay
back
where
you
belong
of
course
if
you
positively
got
to
get
to
the
front
and
ca
find
any
other
road
it
our
place
to
give
you
this
one
just
wait
a
moment
and
we
ask
the
colonel
if
we
ca
it
be
easier
to
ride
over
us
that
oh
go
to
hell
the
parties
passed
the
ranks
of
the
infantry
straightened
out
again
on
the
dark
road
the
column
wound
on
through
the
hot
midnight
wood
more
another
party
of
cavalry
to
be
let
by
they
passed
the
infantry
in
the
darkness
pushing
the
broken
line
into
the
ditch
and
scrub
in
the
pitchy
blackness
an
impatient
command
lost
at
this
juncture
its
temper
the
men
swore
an
officer
called
out
to
the
horsemen
a
savage
halt
the
party
pressed
on
the
officer
furious
caught
a
bridle
rein
halt
damn
you
stop
them
men
now
you
cavalry
have
got
to
learn
a
thing
or
two
one
is
that
the
infantry
is
the
important
thing
in
war
it
the
aristocracy
damn
you
the
other
is
that
we
were
on
this
road
first
anyhow
now
you
just
turn
out
into
the
woods
yourself
and
the
next
time
i
tell
you
to
halt
damn
you
halt
this
sir
said
a
voice
is
general
jackson
and
his
staff
the
officer
stammered
forth
apologies
it
is
all
right
sir
said
the
voice
in
the
darkness
the
cavalry
must
be
more
careful
but
colonel
true
aristocrats
do
not
curse
and
swear
an
hour
later
the
column
halted
in
open
country
a
pleasant
farmhouse
with
a
cool
grassy
yard
surrounded
by
an
ornamental
fence
white
paling
gleaming
in
the
waved
lights
flung
wide
its
doors
to
stonewall
jackson
the
troops
bivouacked
around
in
field
and
meadow
a
rain
came
up
a
chilly
downpour
an
aide
appeared
before
the
brigade
encamped
immediately
about
the
farmhouse
the
general
says
sir
that
the
men
may
take
the
rail
fence
over
there
but
the
regimental
officers
are
to
see
that
under
no
circumstances
is
the
fence
about
wilson
yard
to
be
touched
the
night
passed
officers
had
had
a
hard
day
they
slept
perhaps
somewhat
soundly
wrapped
in
their
oilcloths
in
the
chilly
rain
by
the
smallest
of
sputtering
the
rain
stopped
at
three
the
august
dawn
came
up
gloriously
with
a
cool
freshness
reveille
sounded
stonewall
jackson
came
from
the
farmhouse
looked
about
him
and
then
walked
across
the
grassy
yard
a
little
later
five
colonels
of
five
regiments
found
themselves
ordered
to
report
to
the
general
commanding
the
brigade
gentlemen
as
you
came
by
did
you
notice
the
condition
of
the
ornamental
fence
about
the
yard

did
sir
one
panel

gone
i
suppose
the
men
were
tempted
it
was
a
confounded
cold
rain
the
brigadier
pursed
his
lips
well
colonel
you
heard
the
order
all
of
you

the
order
i
regret
to
say
so
did
tiredness
and
profound
slumber

no
excuse

to
have
heard
them
at
the
palings

ordered
you
all
under
arrest
five
of
us
sir
five
of
you
damn

of

the
five

at
one
another
and
looked
at
their
brigadier

would
you
advise
sir
the
brigadier
was
very
red
i
have
sent
one
of
my
staff
to
wilson
gentlemen
to
enquire
the
cost
of
the
entire
ornamental
fence
advise
that
we
pay
and
if
we
got
any
pay
in
gold
by
eight
the
column
was
in
motion
a
fair
day
and
a
fair
country
with
all
the
harvest
fields
and
the
deep
wooded
hills
and
the
august
sky
after
the
rain
the
roads
were
just
pleasantly
wet
dewdrops
hung
on
the
corn
blades
blackberries
were
ripening
daisies
fringed
the
banks
of
red
earth
the
head
of
the
column
coming
to

an
old
plain
country

in
a
faded
sunbonnet
and
faded
check
apron

had
a

of
the
road

through
the
bright
august
forenoon
the
day
grew
hot
and
the
dust
whirled
up
and
the
cavalry
skirmished
at
intervals
with
detached
blue
clouds
of
horsemen
on
the
horizon
appeared
at
some
distance
a
conical
mountain
what
that
sugar
loaf
over
there
that
slaughter
mountain
south
of
culpeper
cedar
run
beyond
the
day
wore
on
slaughter
mountain
grew
larger
the
country
between
was
lovely
green
and
rolling
despite
the
heat
and
the
dust
and
the
delay
the
troops
were
in
spirits
they
were
going
against
john
pope
and
they
liked
the
job
the
old
army
of
the
valley
now
a
part
of
the
army
of
northern
virginia
rather
admired
shields
had
no
especial
objection
to
mcdowell
and
felt
a
real
gratitude
toward
commissary
banks
but
it
was
prepared
to
fight
pope
with
a
vigour
born
of
detestation
a
man
of
the
old
army
marching
with
ewell
began
to
sing
pope
told
a
flattering
tale
which
proved
to
be
bravado
about
the
streams
that
spout
like
ale
on
the
llano
estacado
that
the
staked
plains
you
know
awful
hot
out

as
the
day
declined
the
battle
swelled
in
smoke
and
thunder
the
blue
batteries
were
well
placed
and
against
them
thundered
grey
rifled
guns
two
parrotts
of

at
the

of
the

tore
down
the
long
slope
and
came
into

an
open
field
skirted
by
a
wood
behind
was
the
stonewall
brigade
in
column
of
regiments
the
guns
were
placed
the
horses
taken
away
the
ball
opened
with
canister
immediately
the
federal
guns
answered
got
the
range
of
the
grey
and
began
to
do
deadly
mischief
all
around
young
trees
were
cut
off
short
the
shells
came
thick
black
and
screaming
the
place
proved
fatal
to
officers
carpenter
was
struck
in
the
head
by
a
piece
of
shell
mortally
wounded
the
chief
of
artillery
major
snowden

desperately
injured

was
hurt
then
lieutenant

the
gunners
worked
like
mad
the
guns
thundered
recoiled
thundered
again
the
blue
shells
arrived
in
a
deadly
stream
all
was
smoke
whistling
limbs
of
trees
glare
and
roar
general
winder
came
up
on
foot
standing
by
a
grey
parrott
he
tried
with
his
field
glass
to
make
out
the
federal
batteries
lowering
the
glass
he
shouted
some
direction
to
the
men
about
the
gun
below
him
the
noise
was
hideous
deafening
seeing
that
he
was
not
understood
he
raised
his
arm
and
hollowed
his
hand
above
his
mouth
a
shell
passed
beneath
his
arm
through
his
side
he
fell
stiffly
back
mangled
and
dying
there
was
a
thick
piece
of
woods
deep
and
dark
stretching
westward
the
left
of

here
ewell

shirt
at
its

not

up
jubal
early
forming
a
line
of

in
the
rolling
fields
an
aide
came
to
old
jube
general
jackson
compliments
to
general
early
and
he
says
you
will
advance
on
the
enemy
and
general
winder

had
a
thin
high
drawling
voice
my
compliments
to
general
jackson
and
tell
him
i
will
do
it
the
stonewall
brigade
drawn
up
in
the
rear
of
the
artillery
stood
waiting
its
orders
from
winder
there
came
a
rumor
the
general
is
killed
general
winder
is
killed
the
stonewall
chose
to
be
incredulous
it
is
not
so
we
do
believe
it
the
cut
to
pieces
at
white
oak
swamp
had
renewed
itself
recruits
boys
and
elderly
men
a
few
melancholy
conscripts
a
number
of
transferals
from
full
commands
had
closed
its
ranks
the
smaller
now
of
diluted
quality
but
even
so
dogged
and
promising
well
the
waiting
on
the
edge
of
a
wheat
field
looked
across
it
to
taliaferro
and
campbell
brigades
and
the
dark
wood
in
front
billy
maydew
was
sergeant
now
and
matthew
coffin
was
first
lieutenant
of
company
a
the
two
had
some
talk
under
a
big
walnut
tree
artillery
been
shouting
for
two
hours
said
coffin
they
got
a
hell
lot
of
cavalry
too
but

billy
it

lonesomer

thar
when
lonesome
things

blaze
out
the
worst
the
colonel
of
the

too
true
men

lost
general
winder
well
we
avenge
him
look
there
is
jubal
early
advancing
early
line
of
battle
was
a
beautiful
sight
it
moved
through
the
fields
and
up
a
gentle
hillside
and
pushed
before
it
bright
clusters
of
federal
cavalry
when
the
grey
lines
came
to
the
hilltop
the
federal
batteries
opened
fiercely

loudly
answered

the

gathered
the
beautiful
blue

many
and
gallant
ewell
with
trimble
south
carolinians
and
harry
louisianians
held
the
slope
of
the
mountain
and
from
these
heights
bellowed
latimer
guns
over
hill
and
vale
the
light
division
was
seen
coming
ten
thousand
men
in
grey
led
by
hill
it
surely
air
a
sight
to
see
said
billy
i
never
even
dreamed
it
back
thar
on

run
there
the
yankees
come

damn
you
billy
what
the
matter

the

answered
billy
thar
something
coming
out
of
the
lonesome
wood
on
the
left
the

virginia
were
the
advance

out
of
the

startling
unexpected
burst
a
long
blue
battle
line
banks
a
brave
man
if
not
a
wise
one
interpreted
pope
orders
somewhat
to
suit
himself
and
attacked
without
waiting
for
sigel
or
mcdowell
in
this
instance
valor
seemed
likely
to
prove
the
better
part
of
discretion
of
the
grey
generals
hill
was
not
up

was
hotly
engaged
the

ronald

place
made
with
despatch
a
line
of
battle
the
smoke
was
everywhere
rolling
and
thick
out
of
it
came
abruptly
a
voice
i
have
always
depended
upon
this
brigade
forward
billy
had
an
impression
of
wheat
stubble
beneath
his
feet
wheat
stubble
thick
strewn
with
men
silent
or
lamentably
crying
out
and
about
his
ears
a
whistling
storm
of
minies
there
was
too
a
whirl
of
grey
forms
there
was
no
alignment
regiments
were
dashed
to
pieces
everybody
was
mixed
up
it
was
like
an
overturned
beehive
then
in
the
swirling
smoke
in
the
swarm
and
shouting
and
grey
rout
he
saw
little
sorrel
and
stonewall
jackson
standing
in
his
stirrups
he
had
drawn
his
sabre
it
flashed
above
his
head
like
a
gleam
from
the
sinking
sun
billy
spoke
aloud
i
been
with
him
from
the
first
and
this
air
the
first
time
i
ever
saw
him
do
that
as
he
spoke
he
caught
hold
of
a
fleeing
grey
soldier
stand
still
and
fight
thar
ai
nothing
in
the
rear
but
damned
safety
the
grey
surge
hung
poised
the
tide
one
moment
between
ebb
and
flow
the
noise
was
hellish
sounds
of
triumph
sounds
of
panic
of
anger
encouragement
appeal
despair
woe
and
pain
with
the
callous
roar
of
musketry
and
the
loud
indifference
of
the
guns
above
it
all
the
man
on
the
quaint
war
horse
made
himself
heard
from
the
blue
line
of
steel
above
his
head
from
the
eyes
below
the
forage
cap
from
the
bearded
lips
from
the
whole
man
there
poured
a
magic
control
he
shouted
and
his
voice
mastered
the
storm

give

the
cavalry
with

fine

staunch
at
this
moment
it
undertook
a
charge
useless
but
magnificent
with
clarion
sound
with
tossing
colours
with
huzzas
and
waving
sabres
a
glorious
and
fearful
sight
the
cavalry
rushed
diagonally
across
the
trampled
field
its
flank
exposed
to
the
north

these
opened
a
blasting
fire
while

met
it

with
pleasure
under

there
was
rough
somewhat
rolling
ground
in
the
dark
night
men
dropped
down
without
particularity
as
to
couch
or
bedchamber
nature
and
the
time
combined
to
spread
for
them
a
long
and
echoing
series
of
sleeping
rooms
carpeted
and
tapestried
according
to
nature
whim
vaulted
with
whistling
storm
or
drift
of
clouds
or
pageantry
of

the
troops
took
the
quarters
indicated
sometimes
with
sometimes
without
remark
there
was
little
speech
of
any
kind
before
falling
into
dreamless
slumber

coral
tinge
overspread
that
far
and
cold
eastern
heaven
the
men
were
busied
about
breakfast
but
now

group
and
presently
that
suspended

faint
awe
a
creeping
horror

were
that
day

seems
so
long
ago
and
yet
it
comes
back

and
longstreet
colonel
fauquier
cary
riding
by
heard
the
last
remark
and
answered
it
marse
robert
and
longstreet
are
marching
by
the
road
we
marched
before
them
perhaps
we
be
again
a
united
family
colonel
are
we
going
to
have
a
battle
i
was
at
the
council
friends
but
i
can
tell
you
what
i
think
yes
yes
we
think
that
you
think
pretty
straight
mccall
and
heintzelman
and
fitz
john
porter
have
joined
general
pope
yes
so
we
hear
and
others
of
the
army
of
the
potomac
are
on
the
way
yes
undoubtedly
but
are
not
here
yet
no
well
then
i
think
that
the
thing
above
all
others
that
general
lee
wants
is
an
immediate
battle
he
rode
on
the
men
to
whom
he
had
been
speaking
looked
after
him
approvingly
he
a
fine
piece
of
steel
always
liked
that
whole
family
is
he
a
cousin
of
yes
wonder
what
he
thinks
about
that
matter
heigho
look
at
the
stealing
light
and
the
grey
shadows
manassas
cary
riding
by
ewell
lines
came
upon
maury
stafford
lying
stretched
beneath
an
oak
studying
too
the
old
battlefield
the
sun
was
up
the
morning
cool
fresh
and
pure
dismounting
cary
seated
himself
beside
the
other
you
were
not
in
the
battle
here
on
the
peninsula
were
you
not
yes
with
magruder
look
at
that
shaft
of
light
yes
it
strikes
the
crest
of
the
hill
just
where
was
the
stonewall
brigade
silence
fell
the
two
sat
brooding
over
the
scene
each
with
his
own
thoughts
this
field
will
be
red
again
said
stafford
at
last
no
doubt
yes
red
again
i
look
for
heavy
fighting
i
saw
you
when
you
came
in
with
hill
on
the
second
but
we
have
not
spoken
together
i
think
since
richmond
no
said
cary
not
since
richmond
one
of
your
men
told
me
that
coming
up
you
stopped
in
albemarle
yes
i
went
home
for
a
few
hours
all
at
greenwood
are
well
and
happy
all
at
greenwood
are
well
southern
women
are
not
precisely
happy
they
are
however
extremely
courageous
may
i
ask
if
miss
cary
is
at
greenwood
she
remained
at
her
work
in
richmond
through
july
then
the
need
at
the
hospital
lessening
she
went
home
yes
she
is
at
greenwood
thank
you
i
am
going
to
ask
another
question
answer
it
or
not
as
you
see
fit
does
she
know
that
most
unfortunately
it
was
i
who
carried
that
order
from
general
jackson
to
general
winder
i
do
not
think
that
she
knows
it
he
rose
the
bugles
are
sounding
i
must
get
back
to
hill
general
lee
will
be
up
i
hope
until
he
comes
we
are
rather
in
the
lion
mouth
happily
john
pope
is
hardly
the
desert
king
he
mounted
his
horse
and
went
stafford
laid
himself
down
beneath
the
oak
looked
sideways
a
moment
at
bull
run
and
the
hills
and
the
woods
then
flung
his
arm
upward
and
across
his
eyes
and
went
in
mind
to
greenwood
the
day
passed
in
a
certain
still
and
steely
watchfulness
in
the
august
afternoon
jeb
stuart
feather
in
hat
around
his
horse
neck
a
garland
of
purple
ironweed
and
yarrow
rode
into
the
lines
and
spoke
for
ten
minutes
with
general
jackson
then
spurred
away
to
the
warrenton
turnpike
almost
immediately
ewell
and
taliaferro
divisions
were
under
arms
and
moving
north
near
groveton
they
struck
the
force
they
were
going
against
division
of
mcdowell
corps
moving
tranquilly
toward
centreville
the
long
blue
column
doubleday
patrick
gibbon
and
brigades
showed
its
flank
it
moved
steadily
with
jingle
and
creak
of
accoutrements
with
soldier
chat
and
laughter
with
a
band
playing
a
quickstep
with
the
rays
of
the
declining
sun
bright
on
and
bayonet
and
with
the
deep
rumble
of
the
accompanying
batteries
the
head
of
the
column
came
in
the
gold
light
to
a
farmhouse
and
an
apple
orchard
out
of
the
peace
and
repose
of
the
scene
burst
a
roar
of
grey
artillery
the
fight
was
fierce
and
bloody
and
marked
by
a
certain
savage
picturesqueness
gibbon
and
doubleday
somehow
deployed
and
seized
a
portion
of
the
orchard
the
grey
held
the
farmhouse
and
the
larger
part
of
the
fair
slopes
the
blue
brought
their
artillery
into
action
the
grey
batteries
posted
high
threw
their
shot
and
shell
over
the
heads
of
the
grey
skirmishers
into
the
opposing
ranks
wooding
poague
and
carpenter
did
well
and
then
thundering
through
the
woods
came
john
pelham
of
stuart
horse
artillery
and
he
too
did
well
as
for
the
infantry
grey
and
blue
they
were
seasoned
troops
there
was
no
charging
this
golden
afternoon
they
merely
stood
blue
and
grey
one
hundred
yards
apart
in
the
apple
orchard
and
then
in
a
twilight
apple
orchard
and
then
in
an
apple
orchard
with
the
stars
conceivably
shining
above
the
roof
of
smoke
and
directed
each
against
the
other
a
great
storm
of
musketry
round
shot
and
canister
it
lasted
two
and
a
half
hours
that
tornado
and
it
never
relaxed
in
intensity
it
was
a
bitter
fight
and
there
was
bitter
loss
doubleday
and
gibbon
suffered
fearfully
and
ewell
and
taliaferro
suffered
grey
and
blue
they
stood
grimly
and
the
tornado
raged
the
ghosts
of
the
quiet
husbandmen
who
had
planted
the
orchard
of
the
lovers
who
may
have
walked
there
of
the
children
who
must
have
played
beneath
the
trees
these
were
scared
far
far
from
the
old
peaceful
haunt
it
was
a
bitter
fight
stafford
was
beside
ewell
when
the
latter
fell
a
shell
dreadfully
shattering
his
leg
the
younger
man
caught
him
drew
him
quite
from
poor
old
rifle
and
with
the
help
of
the
men
about
got
him
behind
the
slight
slight
shelter
of
one
of
the
little
curtsying
trees
old
dick
face
twitched
but
he
could
speak
of
course
i
lost
that
leg
old
jackson
is
around
is
he
never
mind
occasion
must
excuse
go
along
gentlemen
need
you
all
there
doctors
and
chaplains
and
the
teamsters
and
dick
ewell
will
forgather
all
right
damn
you
maury
i
do
want
you
to
stay
what
that
that
man
says
taliaferro
badly
wounded
gentlemen
one
and
all
you
are
ordered
back
to
your
posts
i
lost
a
leg
but
i
not
going
to
lose
this
battle
night
came
with
each
stark
battle
line
engaged
in
giving
and
receiving
as
deadly
a
bombardment
as
might
well
be
conceived
the
orchard
grew
a
place
tawny
and
red
and
roaring
with
sound
and
then
at
nine
the
sound
dwindled
and
the
light
sank
the
blue
withdrew
in
good
order
taking
with
them
their
wounded
the
battle
was
drawn
the
grey
rested
on
the
field
the
loss
of
both
was
heavy
back
of
the
apple
orchard
on
the
long
natural
terrace
where
he
had
posted
his
six
guns
that
tall
blond
very
youthful
officer
whom
a
little
later
stuart
called
the
heroic
chivalric
pelham
whom
lee
called
the
gallant
pelham
of
whom
stonewall
jackson
said
every
army
should
have
a
pelham
on
each
flank
major
john
pelham
surveyed
the
havoc
among
his
men
and
horses
then
like
a
good
and
able
leader
he
brought
matters
shipshape
and
later
announced
that
the
horse
artillery
would
stay
where
it
was
for
the
night
the
farmhouse
in
the
orchard
had
been
turned
into
a
field
hospital
thither
pelham
wounded
were
borne
of
the
hurt
horses
those
that
might
be
saved
were
carefully
tended
the
others
shot
the
pickets
were
placed
fires
were
kindled
and
from
a
supply
wagon
somewhere
in
the
rear
scanty
rations
brought
an
embassy
went
to
the
farmhouse
the
major
major
pelham
says
kin
we
please
have
a
few
roasting
ears
the
embassy
returned
she
says
sir
just
to
help
ourselves
corn
apples
anything
we
want
and
she
wishes
it
were
more
the
six
guns
gleamed
red
in
the
light
of
the
kindled
fires
the
men
sat
or
lay
between
them
tasting
rest
after
battle
below
this
platform
in
the
orchard
and
on
the
turnpike
and
in
the
woods
beyond
showed
also
fires
and
moving
lights
the
air
was
yet
smoky
the
night
close
and
warm
there
were
no
tents
nor
roofs
of
any
nature
officers
and
men
rested
in
the
open
beneath
the
august
stars
pelham
had
a
log
beneath
a
lombardy
poplar
with
a
wide
outlook
toward
the
old
field
of
manassas
here
he
talked
with
one
of
his
captains
too
many
men
lost
i
feel
it
through
and
through
that
there
is
going
to
be
heavy
fighting
we
have
to
fill
up
somehow
everybody
from
this
region
in
already
we
might
get
some
or
some
though
or
we
might
ask
the
department
for
conscripts
do
like
the
latter
material
prefer
the
first
well
we
think
about
it
it
late
late
haralson
wait
said
haralson
here
a
man
wants
to
speak
to
you
running
up
the
hillside
from
the
platform
where
were
the
guns
to
a
little
line
of
woods
dark
against
the
starlit
sky
was
a
cornfield
between
it
and
the
log
and
the
poplar
only
a
little
grassy
depression
a
man
had
come
out
of
the
cornfield
he
stood
ten
feet
away
a
countryman
apparently
poorly
dressed
well
who
are
you
demanded
pelham
and
how
did
you
get
in
my
lines
i
been
said
the
man
tramping
it
over
from
the
mountains
and
when
i
got
into
this
county
i
found
it
chock
full
of
armies
i
want
to
be
taken
up
by
the
yankees
and
so
i
been
mostly
travelling
by
night
i
was
in
that
wood
up
there
while
you
all
were
fighting
i
had
a
good
view
of
the
battle
when
it
was
over
i
said
to
myself
all
they
my
folk
and
i
came
down
through
the
corn
i
was
lying
there
between
the
stalks
i
heard
you
say
you
needed
gunners
i
said
to
myself

well

to
join
one
way
or
another
that
clear
and

more

got
a
blow
on
the
head
in
a
saw
mill
on
briony
creek
and
it
made
me
just
as
useless
as
a
bit
of
pith
the
doctor
says
i
am
all
right
now
sir
i
got
tired
of
staying
on
briony

steady
bearded
face

much
obliged
to
you
sir
i
have
any
awkward

into
which
to

him
and
enroll
him

him
over
to
dreux
and
the
howitzer

that
all
day
broke
over
the
field
of
groveton
over
the
plains
of
manassas
stonewall
jackson
moved
in
force
westward
from
the
old
south
of
bull
run
between
young
branch
and
stony
ridge
ran
an
unfinished
railroad
it
was
bordered
by
woods
and
rolling
fields
there
were
alternate
embankments
and
deep
railroad
cuts
behind
was
the
long
ridge
and
catharpin
run
in
front
sloping
gently
to
the
little
stream
green
fields
broken
to
the
north
by
one
deep
wood
stonewall
jackson
laid
his
hand
on
the
railroad
with
those
deep
cuts
and
on
the
rough
and
rising
ground
beyond
in
the
red
dawn
there
stretched
a
battle
front
of
nearly
two
miles
hill
had
the
left
trimble
and

centre

rocky
ridge

stuart
guarded
the
flanks
the
chill
moisture
of
the
morning
the
earth
the
quiet
woods
the
rose
light
in
the
sky
the
troops
moving
here
and
there

their
assigned
positions
exchanged
opinions
ai
it
like

the
boys
behind

embankment
well
if

is
the
breastwork

bandaged
a
flesh
wound
in
the
arm
edward
cary
straightened
himself
and
wiped
away
the
sweat
and
powder
grime
which
blinded
him
an
officer
voice
came
out
of
the
murk
the
general
asks
for
volunteers
to
strip
the
field
of
cartridges
there
were
four
men
lying
together
killed
by
the
same
shell
the
head
of
one
was
gone
the
legs
of
another
the
third
was
disembowelled
the
fourth
had
his
breast
crushed
in
their
cartridge
boxes
when
opened
were
found
to
be
half
full
edward
emptied
them
into
the
haversack
he
carried
and
went
on
to
the
next
this
was
a
boy
of
sixteen
not
dead
yet
moaning
like
a
wounded
hound
edward
gave
him
the
little
water
that
was
in
his
canteen
took
four
cartridges
from
his
box
and
crept
on
a
minie
sang
by
him
struck
a
yard
away
full
in
the
forehead
of
the
dead
man
toward
whom
he
was
making
the
dead
man
had
a
smile
upon
his
lips
it
was
as
though
he
mocked
the
bullet
all
the
field
running
back
from
the
railroad
cuts
and
embankment
was
overstormed
by
shot
and
shell
and
everywhere
from
the
field
rose
groans
and
cries
for
water
the
word
water
never
ceased
from
use
water
water
water
water
on
it
went
mournfully
like
a
water
edward
gathered
cartridges
steadily
all
manner
of
things
were
wont
to
come
into
his
mind
just
now
it
was
a
certain
field
behind
greenwood
covered
with
blackberry
bushes
and
the
hot
august
sunshine
and
he
and
easter
jim
gathering
blackberries
while
mammy
watched
from
beneath
a
tree
he
heard
again
the
little
thud
of
the
berries
into
the
bucket
he
took
the
cartridges
from
two
young
men
brothers
from
the
resemblance
and
from
the
fact
that
falling
together
one
the
younger
had
pillowed
his
head
on
the
other
breast
while
the
elder
arm
was
around
him
they
lay
like
children
in
sleep
the
next
man
was
elderly
a
lonely
person
with
a
face
slightly
contorted
and
a
great
hole
in
his
breast
the
next
that
edward
came
to
was
badly
hurt
but
not
too
badly
to
take
an
interest
cartridges
yes
five
i
awful
thirsty
well
never
mind
maybe
it
will
rain
who
charging
now
heintzelman

too
i

just
loading
when
i
got
hit
well
sorry
you
got
to
go
it
mighty
lonely
lying
here
edward
returned
to
the
front
gave
up
his
haversack
and
got
another
as
he
turned
to
resume
the
cartridge
quest
there
arose
a
cry
steady
men
steady
hooker
has
had
enough
edward
too
saw
the
blue
wall
coming
through
the
woods
on
the
other
side
of
the
railroad
he
took
a
musket
from
a
dead
man
near
by
and
with
all
the
other
grey
soldiers
lay
flat
in
the
grass
above

the
long

sprang
to
its

and
fired
dropped
and
loaded
rose
and
fired
a
leaden
storm
visited
the
wood
across
the
track
the
august
grass
was
long
and
dry
sparks
set
it
afire
flames
arose
and
caught
the
oak
scrub
through
it
all
and
through
the
storm
of
bullets
the

it
came
down
on

he
turned
his

kearney

on
the

run
the
general
from
the
west
where
we
have
always
seen
the
backs
of
our
enemy
sent
a
remarkable
telegram
to
halleck
at
washington
we
fought
a
terrific
battle
here
yesterday
with
the
combined
forces
of
the
enemy
which
lasted
with
continuous
fury
from
daylight
until
dark
by
which
time
the
enemy
was
driven
from
the
field
which
we
now
occupy
the
enemy
is
still
in
our
front
but
badly
used
up
we
lost
not
less
than
eight
thousand
men
killed
and
wounded
but
from
the
appearance
of
the
field
the
enemy
lost
two
to
one
the
news
has
just
reached
me
from
the
front
that
the
enemy
is
retreating
toward
the
mountains
the
delusion
holding
he
at
noon
of
the
thirtieth
ordered
a
general
advance
the
troops
to
be
immediately
thrown
forward
in
pursuit
of
the
enemy
and
to
press
him
vigorously
one
of
his
officers
undertook
a
comment
by
the
lord
harry
it
will
be
the
shortest
pursuit
that
even
he
ever
saw
why
damn
it
all
they
still
here
i
tell
you
the
place
is
unlucky
twenty
thousand
blue
soldiers
formed
the
front
that
came
down
from
the
hills
and
moved
toward
the
groveton
wood
and
the
railroad
track
behind
them
were
supporting
masses
forty
thousand
strong
on
every
slope
gleamed
the
great
blue
guns
the
guns
opened
they
shelled
with
vehemence
the
wood
the
railroad
cut
and
embankment
the
field
immediately
beyond
a
line
of
grey
pickets
was
seen
to
leave
the
wood
and
make
across
the
track
and
into
cover
pope
at
the
stone
house
saw
these
with
his
field
glass
the
last
of
their
rear
guard
he
said
one
of
his
generals
spoke
their
guns
are
undoubtedly
yet
on
that
ridge
sir
i
am
perfectly
well
aware
of
that
sir
but
they
will
not
be
there
long
after
our
line
has
crossed
the
track
either
we
will
gloriously
take
them
or
they
will
limber
up
and
scamper
after
jackson
he
i
take
it
is
well
on
his
way
to
thoroughfare
gap
all
that
we
need
is
expedition
crush
him

then
when

up

on

give
you
my
word

the

cut
on
the

side
of
the

ran
a
stretch
of
field
and
scrub
mounting
to
stony
ridge
that
rose
from
the
base
of
the
woods
stony
ridge
looked
grey
itself
and
formidable
and
all
about
it
was
the
smoke
of
the
forty
grey
guns
the
twenty
thousand
bayonets
pressed
on
there
came
a
blare
of
bugles
loud
and
high
they
rang
the
bugles
of
the
light
division
of
ewell
of
jackson
own
they
pierced
the
thunder
of
the
guns
they
came
from
the
wood
at
the
base
of
stony
ridge
there
was
a
change
in
the
below
the
twenty
thousand
bayonets
porter
and
ricketts

stared
and
saw
start
from
the

it
moved
fast
it
approached
with
a
certain
impetuous
steadiness
behind
it
were

of
the
road
a
piece
of
bronze
played
round
by
lightning
one
of
the
brigadiers
was
speaking
to
him
the
cartridges
are
soaking
wet
sir
i
do
not
know
that
i
can
hold
my
position
jackson
voice
came
deep
and
curt
yes
sir
you
can
if
your
muskets
wo
go
off
neither
will
the
enemy
you
are
to
hold
it
whether
you
can
or
not
go
and
do
it
the
brigadier
went
stafford
gave
his
information
and
received
an
order
go
back
along
the
road
until
you
find
the
horse
artillery
tell
major
pelham
to
bring
his
guns
to
the
knoll
yonder
with
the
blasted
tree
stafford
turned
his
horse
and
started
the
rain
and
wind
were
now
at
his
back
a
hundred
paces
and
the
road
lonely
save
for
stragglers
the
grey
troops
the
battle
in
front
was
all
sheeted
and
shrouded
in
the
darkly
drifting
storm
the
fitful
bursts
of
musketry
were
lost
beneath
the
artillery
of
the
clouds
he
travelled
a
mile
found
pelham
and
gave
his
order
then
stood
aside
under
the
tossing
pines
while
the
horse
artillery
went
by
it
went
by
in
the
dusk
of
the
storm
in
the
long
howl
of
the
wind
and
the
dash
of
the
rain
like
the
iron
chariots
of
pluto
the
horses
galloping
the
gunners
clinging
wherever
they
might
place
hand
or
foot
the
officers
and
mounted
men
spurring
alongside
stafford
let
them
all
turn
a
bend
in
the
road
then
followed
all
this
stretch
of
road
and
field
and
wood
had
been
skirmished
over
stuart
and
the
blue
cavalry
having
been
in
touch
through
the
earlier
part
of
the
day
the
road
was
level
with
the
mournful
boggy
fields
with
the
wild
bending
woods
in
the
fields
and
in
the
woods
there
were
dark
objects
which
might
be
mounds
of
turf
or
huge
twisted
roots
or
which
might
be
dead
men
and
horses
stafford
riding
through
wind
and
rain
had
no
sooner
thought
this
than
he
saw
indeed
what
seemed
a
mere
hummock
beneath
a
clump
of
cedars
undoubtedly
move
he
looked
as
closely
as
he
might
for
the
war
of
water
air
and
fire
and
made
out
a
horse
outstretched
and
stark
and
a
man
pinned
beneath
the
man
spoke
hello
upon
the
road
there
come
and
do
a
christian
turn
stafford
left
his
horse
and
stepping
through
a
quagmire
of
watery
turf
came
into
the
ring
of
cedars
the
man
who
had
called
upon
him
a
tall
person
in
blue
one
arm
and
booted
leg
painfully
caught
beneath
the
dead
steed
spoke
in
a
voice
curt
with
suffering
grey
are
you
do
care
ca
help
it
get
this
infernal
weight
off
me
wo
you
the
other
bent
to
the
task
and
at
last
managed
to
free
the
blue
soldier
there
that
position
must
have
been
no
joke
how
long
the
blue
cavalryman
proceeded
to
feel
bone
and
flesh
slowly
and
cautiously
to
move
the
imprisoned
limbs
he
drew
a
breath
of
relief
nothing
broken
how
long
well
to
reckon
by
one
feeling
i
should
say
about
a
week
say
however
since
about
noon
we
drove
against
a
party
under
stuart
he
got
the
best
of
us
and
poor
caliph
got
a
bullet
i
could
see
the
road
everything
grey
grey
as
the
sea
why
did
you
call
before
any
one
would
have
helped
you
the
other
continued
to
rub
his
arm
and
leg
you
have
got
a
drop
of
brandy
eh
yes
i
have
i
should
have
thought
of
that
before
he
gave
the
other
a
small
flask
the
cavalryman
drank
ah
in
when
i
was
with
walker
in
nicaragua
i
got
pinned
like
that
beneath
a
falling
cottonwood
he
gave
the
flask
back
you
are
the
kind
of
samaritan
i
like
to
meet
i
feel
a
new
man
thanks
awfully
it
was
foolish
of
you
to
lie
there
for
hours
the
other
leaned
his
back
against
a
cedar
well
i
thought
i
might
hold
out
perhaps
until
we
beat
you
and
i
was
again
in
the
house
of
my
friends
i
do
however
object
to
acknowledging
that
you
hard
to
beat
could
manage
it
growing
cold
and
faint
head
ringing
waited
as
long
as
i
could
then
called
they
say
your
prisons
are
very
bad
they
are
no
worse
than
yours
that
may
be
any
of
them
are
bad
we
are
a
ravaged
and
blockaded
country
it
is
with
some
difficulty
that
we
feed
and
clothe
our
armies
in
the
field
as
for
medicines
with
which
to
fight
disease
you
will
not
let
them
pass
not
for
our
women
and
children
and
sick
at
home
and
not
for
your
own
men
in
prison
and
for
all
our
representations
you
will
not
exchange
prisoners
if
there
is
undue
suffering
i
think
you
must
share
the
blame
yes
yes
it
is
all
hellish
enough
well
on
one
side
of
the
dice
prisoner
of
war
on
the
other
death
here
under
poor
caliph
might
escape
from
prison
no
escape
from
death
by
jove
what
a
thunderclap
it
stonewall
jackson
pursuing
us
eh
yes

stafford
serving
on
general
ewell
yes
pelham
he
straightened
himself
i
must
be
getting
back
to
the
front
it
is
hard
to
hear
for
the
wind
and
rain
and
thunder
but
i
think
the
musketry
is
recommencing
he
looked
about
him
we
came
through
these
woods
this
morning
stuart
has
patrols
everywhere
but
i
think
that
dip
between
the
hills
may
be
clear
you
are
pretty
pale
yet
you
had
better
keep
the
brandy
flask
are
you
sure
that
you
can
walk
walk
beside

into
your
lines
you
mean
no
i
mean
try
a
way
out
between
the
hills
i
am
not
your
prisoner
no
marchmont
pulled
at
his
moustaches
yes
i
think
i
can
walk
i
deprive
you
of
your
flask
but
if
i
might
have
another
mouthful
thank
you
he
rose
stiffly
if
at
any
time
i
can
serve
you
i
trust
that
you
will
remember
my
name
francis
marchmont
colonel
marchmont
invincibles
send
me
a
slip
of
paper
a
word
anything
will
do
and
you
will
find
me
at
your
service
yes
the
firing
is
beginning
again
stafford
once
more
upon
the
road
travelled
northward
in
an
unabated
storm
tree
and
bush
weed
flower
and
grass
writhed
and
shrank
beneath
the
anger
of
the
air
the
rain
hissed
and
beat
the
lightning
glared
the
thunder
crashed
between
the
flashes
all
was
dusk
before
him
the
rattle
of
musketry
the
booming
of
the
guns
grew
louder
he
saw
to
the
right
on
a
bare
rise
of
ground
pelham
guns
there
came
an
attempted
flanking
movement
of
the
blue
a
dash
of
cavalry
met
by
stuart
and
followed
by
a
movement
of
two
of
hill
brigades
the
action
barred
the
road
and
fields
before
stafford
he
watched
it
a
moment
then
turned
aside
and
mounted
the
rise
of
ground
to
guns
a
great
lit
them
ranged
above
him
all
their
wet
metal
gleamed
about
them
moved
the
gunners
a
man
with
a
lifted
sponge
staff
looked
an
unearthly
figure
against
the
fantastic
castles
and
battlements
the
peaks
and
abysses
of
the
boiling
clouds
the
light
vanished
stafford
came
level
with
the
guns
in
the
dusk
pelham
welcomed
him
in
god
and
keep
your
powder
dry
eh
major
it
the
kind
of
storm
you
read
about
hello
they
brought
up
another
battery
stafford
dismounted
one
of
the
guns
had
the
vent
so
burned
and
enlarged
that
it
was
useless
it
rested
cold
and
silent
beside
its
bellowing
fellows
stafford
seated
himself
on
the
limber
and
watched
the
double
storm
it
raged
above
the
little
hill
with
its
chain
lightnings
with
wind
with
reverberations
of
thunder
and
it
raged
below
between
some
thousands
of
grey
and
blue
figures
small
small
in
the
dusk
shadowy
manikins
sending
from
metal
tubes
flashes
he
sat
with
his
chin
in
his
hand
pondering
the
scene
pelham
came
heavily
into
action
there
was
a
blue
battery
on
the
opposite
hill
the
two
spoke
in
whispers
beneath
the
storm
the
gunners
now
in
darkness
now
in
the
vivid
lightning
moved
about
the
guns
now
they
bent
low
now
they
stood
upright
the
officer
gestured
to
them
and
they
to
each
other
several
were
killed
or
wounded
and
as
now
this
section
now
that
was
more
deeply
engaged
there
was
some
shifting
among
the
men
occasional
changes
of
place
the
dusk
increased
it
was
evident
that
soon
night
and
the
storm
would
put
an
end
to
the
battle
stafford
watching
made
out
that
even
now
the
blue
and
grey
forms
in
the
tossing
woods
and
boggy
meadows
were
showing
less
and
less
their
fires
were
beginning
to
move
apart
the
guns
above
them
boomed
more
slowly
with
intervals
between
their
speech
the
thunder
came
now
not
in
cracks
but
with
long
rolling
peals
with
spaces
between
filled
only
by
the
wind
and
the
rain
the
human
voice
might
be
heard
and
the
officers
shouted
not
gestured
their
orders
the
twilight
deepened
the
men
about
the
gun
nearest
stafford
looked
but
shadows
bending
leaning
across
rising
upright
they
talked
however
and
the
words
were
now
audible
yes
if
you
could
handle
lightning
take
one
of
them
zigzags
and
turn
it
loose
on
blue
people
that
battery
is
tired
it
going
home
right
tired
myself
reckon
we
all
tired
but
old
jack
he
do
never
get
tired
this
is
a
pretty
behaving
gun
that
so
and
she
got
good
men
they
do
that
so
even
the
new
one
good
good
he
learned
that
gun
same
as
though
they
artillery
wherever
he
came
from
briery
creek
no
briony
creek
hey
deaderick
briony
creek
stafford
dropped
his
hand
who
spoke
the
question
had
been
breathed
not
loudly
uttered
no
one
answered
the
gunners
continued
their
movements
about
the
guns
stooping
handling
lifting
themselves
upright
it
was
all
but
night
the
lightning
less
and
less
violent
revealing
little
beyond
mere
shape
and
action
stafford
sank
back
storm
within
and
storm
without
they
breed
delusions
the
blue
battery
opposite
limbered
up
and
went
away
the
musketry
fire
in
the
hollows
between
the
hills
grew
desultory
a
slow
crackle
of
shots
would
be
followed
by
silence
then
might
come
with
fierce
energy
a
sudden
volley
silence
followed
it
too
or
what
by
comparison
seemed
silence
the
thunder
rolled
more
and
more
distantly
the
wind
lashed
the
trees
the
rain
beat
upon
the
guns
officers
and
men
of
the
horse
artillery
were
too
tired
too
wet
and
too
busy
for
much
conversation
but
still
human
voices
came
and
went
in
the
lessening
blast
in
the
and
the
streaming
rain
there
was
a
gunner
near
stafford
who
worked
in
silence
and
rested
from
his
work
in
silence
stafford
became
conscious
of
him
during
one
of
the
latter
periods
a
silent
man
leaning
against
his
gun
he
was
not
ten
feet
away
but
the
twilight
was
now
deep
and
he
rested
indistinct
a
shadow
against
a
shadow
once
there
came
a
pale
lightning
flash
but
his
arm
was
raised
as
if
to
shield
his
eyes
and
there
was
seen
but
a
strongly
made
gunner
with
a
sponge
staff
darkness
came
again
at
once
the
impression
that
remained
with
stafford
was
that
the
gunner
face
was
turned
toward
him
that
he
had
indeed
when
the
flash
came
been
regarding
him
somewhat
closely
that
was
nothing
a
man
not
of
the
battery
a
staff
officer
sitting
on
a
disabled
gun
waiting
till
he
could
make
his
way
back
to
his
chief
a
moment
curiosity
on
an
artilleryman
part
exhibited
in
a
lull
between
fighting
stafford
had
a
certain
psychic
development
a
thinker
he
was
adventurous
in
that
world
to
him
the
true
world
of
action
the
passion
that
had
seized
and
bound
him
had
come
with
the
force
of
an
invader
of
a
barbaric
horde
from
a
world
that
he
ordinarily
ignored
it
held
him
helpless
an
enslaved
spirit
but
around
it
vaguely
worked
the
old
habits
of
mind
now
it
interested
him
though
only
to
a
certain
degree
that
in
some
subtle
fashion
and
for
some
reason
which
he
could
not
explain
the
gunner
with
the
sponge
staff
could
so
make
himself
felt
across
space
he
wondered
a
little
about
this
man
and
then
insensibly
he
began
to
review
the
past
he
had
resolution
enough
and
he
did
not
always
choose
to
review
the
past
it
was
perhaps
the
atmosphere
the
commotion
of
the
elements
the
harp
of
the
wind
the
scourging
rain
at
any
rate
he
reviewed
it
and
fully
when
the
circle
was
completed
and
his
attention
touched
again
the
storm
and
the
twilight
hill
near
chantilly
and
he
lifted
his
eyes
from
the
soaked
and
trodden
ground
it
was
to
find
the
double
shadow
still
before
him
he
felt
that
the
eyes
of
the
gunner
with
the
sponge
staff
were
on
him
had
been
on
him
for
some
time
quite
involuntarily
he
moved
with
a
sudden
gesture
as
though
he
evaded
a
blow
a
sergeant
voice
came
through
the
twilight
the
wind
and
the
rain
deaderick
the
man
by
the
gun
moved
took
up
the
sponge
staff
that
had
rested
beside
him
turned
in
the
darkness
and
went
away
a
little
later
stafford
left
the
hilltop
the
cannon
had
ceased
their
booming
except
for
here
and
there
a
fitful
burst
the
musketry
fire
had
ceased
pope
rearguard
lee
advance
the
two
drew
off
and
the
engagement
rested
indecisive
blue
and
grey
a
thousand
or
two
men
suffered
death
or
wounding
they
lay
upon
the
miry
earth
beneath
the
pelting
storm
among
the
blue
kearney
and
stevens
were
killed
through
the
darkness
that
wrapped
the
scene
stafford
found
at
last
his
way
to
his
general
he
found
him
with

was

run
mountain
faint
reds
and
yellows
were
beginning
to
show
in
the
maple
leaves
while
the
gum
trees
dwelling
in
the
hollows
had
a
deeper
tinge
of
crimson
but
the
mass
of
the
forest
was
yet
green
the
september
sun
was
like
balm
amber
days
at
once
alert
and
the
september
nights
were
chilly
but
the
war
that
pinched
and
starved
and
took
away
on
all
hands
left
the
forest
and
the
wood
for
fires
on
thunder
run
the
women
cut
the
wood
and
the
children
gathered
dead
boughs
and

cones
the
road
over
the
mountain
was
in
a
bad
condition
it
had
not
been
worked
for
a
year
that
mattered
the
less
perhaps
that
it
was
now

every

tom

sat
in

on
the

the
box
for
the
toll
beside
him
and
listened
for
wheels
or
horses
hoofs
it
was
an
event
now
when
he
could
hobble
out
to
the
gate
take
the
toll
and
pass
the
time
of
day
he
grew
querulous
over
the
state
of
the
road
there
surely
be
more
travel
if
war
so
bad
oh
yes
i
know
there
are
many
left
hereabouts
to
travel
and
what
there
are
have
got
the
means
but
there
surely
would
be
more
going
over
the
mountain
if
the
road
wa
so
bad
he
had
a
touch
of
fever
and
he
babbled
about
the
road
all
night
and
how
hard
it
was
not
to
see

happily
welcomed
by
the
noise
of

thar

sairy
ai
it
a
real
picnic
feeling
to
get
back
to

tom
went
out
to
the
gate
with
the
tobacco
box
a
road

slight
slight
from

no

tom
sat
in
the
sun
on
the
porch
and
the
big
yellow
cat
slept
beside
him
and
the
china
asters
bloomed
in
the
tiny
yard
sairy
was
drying
apples
she
had
them
spread
on
boards
in
the
sun
now
and
then
she
came
from
the
kitchen
to
look
at
them
and
with
a
peach
bough
to
drive
the
bees
away
the
close
of
summer
found
as
ever
thunder
run
shrunken
to
something
like
old
age
but
even
so
his
murmur
was
always
there
like
a
wind
in
the
trees
this
morning
there
was
a
fleet
of
clouds
in
the
september
sky
their
shadows
drove
across
the
great
landscape
the
ridges
and
levels
of
the
earth
out
upon
which
thunder
run
mountain
looked
so
steadily
a
woman
a
neighbour
living
a
mile
beyond
the
schoolhouse

by
sairy

over
to
the
little
picket
fence
and
the

talked
how

the
child
born
dead
sairy
struck
her
tongue
against
the
roof
of
her
mouth
sho
war
even
thar
the
mountain
woman
spoke
on
in
the
slow
mountain
voice
she
had
awful
dreams

fool
enough
to
tell
her
how
dreadful
thirsty
wounded
folk
get
lyin
thar
all
round
the
clock

no

comin
some
other

she
thought
she
was
a
soldier
an
when

she
thought
she
was
wounded
she
thought
she
was
all
mangled
and
torn
by
a
cannon
ball
yes
it
was
pitiful
an
she
said
thar
was
a
high
hill
it
was
five
miles
high
she
said
an
she
said
thar
was
water
at
the
top
which
was
foolish
but
she
could
help
that
an
god
knows
women
go
through
enough
to
make
them
foolish
she
said
thar
was
jest
one
path
an
thar
was
two
children
playing
on
it
an
she
could
make
them

on
up
thunder
run
mountain
sairy
turned
again
the
drying
apples
then
brought
her
patching
out
upon
the
porch
and
sat
down
in
a
low
chair
opposite
tom
the
yellow
cat
at
her
feet
yawned
stretched
and
went
back
to
sleep
the
china

odours
of
thyme
and
rue
and
tansy

the
edge
of
the
porch
her
back
against
the
pillar
she
took
off
her
sunbonnet
violetta
learned
to
do
a
heap
of
things
while

was
down
t
richmond

took
a
heap
of
them

time
than

used
to
have
somehow
i
jest
wander
round
tom
took
a
tin
box
from
beside
the
tobacco
box

be
awful
if

ten
days
or
two
weeks
reckon
i
go
plumb
crazy
an
so
would
sairy
sairy
turned
the
garment
she
was
patching
sho
i
would
go
crazy
what
the
use
when
it
happening
all
the
time
i
ai
denying
that
most
of
the
light
would
go
out
of
things
stop
imaginin
an
read
christianna
what
he
says
about
furin
parts
after
gaines
mill
it
was
twelve
days
said
tom
an
the
twelfth
day
we
did
say
a
word
only
sairy

the
bible
an
now
he
well
and
rejoined
at
leesburg
he
cleared
his
throat
dear
aunt
sairy
and
tom
it
fine
to
get
back
to
the
army
it
an
army
that
you
can
love
i
do
love
it
but
i
love
thunder
run
and
the
school
house
and
tom
and
sairy
cole
too
and
sometimes
i
miss
them
dreadfully
i
rejoined
at
leesburg
the
i
ca
speak
of
the
you
know
why
it
breaks
my
heart
but
reorganized
the
boys
were
glad
to
see
me
and
i
was
glad
to
see
them
tell
christianna
that
billy
all
right
he
sergeant
now
and
he
does
fine
and
dave
all
right
too
and
the
rest
of
the
thunder
run
men
the
war
done
a
heap
for
mathew
coffin
it
made
a
real
man
of
him
tom
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
us
fording
the
potomac
it
was
like
a
picture
book
all
a
pretty
silver
morning
with
grey
plovers
wheeling
overhead
and
the
maryland
shore
green
and
sweet
and
the
water
cool
to
your
waist
and
the
men
laughing
and
calling
and
singing
my
maryland
fitzhugh
lee
was
ahead
with
the
cavalry
it
was
pretty
to
see
the
horses
go
over
and
the
blessed
guns
that
we
know
and
love
every
iron
man
of
them
and
all
the
white
covered
wagons
our
division
crossed
last
old
jack
at
the
head
when
we
came
up
from
the
river
into
maryland
we
turned
toward
frederick
the
country
much
like
our
own
and
the
people
pleasant
enough
you
know
we
got
the
maryland
line
and
a
number
besides
they
fine
men
a
little
dashing
but
mighty
steady
too
they
expressed
themselves
straight
along
as
positively
certain
that
all
maryland
would
rise
and
join
us
there
a
line
of
the
song
you
know
huzzah
huzzah
she
breathes
she
burns
she
come
she
come
maryland
my
maryland
she
has
come
yet
the
people
evidently
do
dislike
us
and
as
a
matter
of
course
we
are
giving
them
any
reason
to
but
their
farms
are
all
nice
and
green
and
well
tilled
and
we
have
seen
a
burned
house
or
mill
and
the
children
are
going
to
school
and
the
stock
is
all
sleek
and
well
fed
and
if
they
have
seen
they
heard
of
the
desolation
on
our
side
of
the
river
they
got
a
pretty
good
idea
of
what
war
is
and
they
where
more
people
would
be
if
they
had
that
idea
beforehand
they
are
willing
to
keep
out
of
so
they
respectful
and
friendly
and
they
crowd
around
to
try
to
get
a
glimpse
of
general
lee
and
general
jackson
but
they
do
volunteer
not
in
shoals
as
the
marylanders
said
they
would
the
maryland
line
looks
disdain
at
them
mathew
coffin
is
dreadfully
fretted
about
the
way
we
dressed
he
says
that
the
reason
maryland
wo
come
but
the
mess
laughs
at
him
it
says
that
if
virginia
does
mind
maryland
need
i
wish
you
could
see
us
aunt
sairy
when
i
think
of
how
i
went
away
from
you
and
tom
with
that
trunk
full
of
lovely
clean
things
now
we
are
gaunt
and
ragged
and
shoeless
and
dirty
tom
stopped
to
wipe
his
spectacles
sairy
threaded
a
needle
all
that
less
lasting
than
some
other
things
they
air
i
reckon
they
leave
a
brighter
streak
than
a
deal
of
folk
who
are
gaunt
an
ragged
an
shoeless
an
dirty
i
do
ever
see
them
so
said
christianna
in
her
soft
drawling
voice
i
see
them
just
like
a
piece
we
had
in
a
book
of
reading
pieces
at
school
it
was
a
hard
piece
but
i
learned
it
all
furnished
all
in
arms
all
plumed
like
estridges
that
with
the
wind
bated
like
eagles
having
lightly
bathed
glittering
in
golden
coats
like
images
no
i
reckon
if
virginia
do
mind
maryland
need
tom
began
again
we
got
a
lovely
camp
here
and
it
good
to
lie
and
rest
on
the
green
grass
the
army
has
had
hard
fighting
and
hard
marching
second
manassas
was
a
big
battle
it
in
the
air
that

another

you
worry
about
me

never
forget
that

loved
you

thought
of

the
very
last

hard

sometimes
for
it
getting
hard
everywhere
and
you
ca
see
the
end
i
wish
i
had
some
pay
to
send
you
but
we
are
getting
any
now

war

to
be
fought
without
food

sairy
just
right
honestly
how
you
are
getting
on
it
getting
toward
winter
when
i
say
my
prayers
i
pray
now
that
it
wo
be
a
hard
winter
a
lot
of
us
are
praying
that
right
pitiful
the
men
with
wives
and
children
at
home
and
the
country
growing
to
look
like
a
but
that
gloomy
talk
and
if
one
thing
more
than
another
we
got
to
avoid
it
being
gloomy
tell
me
everything
when
you
write
write
to
winchester
that
our
base
of
supplies
and
rendezvous

of
all

me
about
yourselves
give
my
very
best
regards
to
christianna
she
surely
was
good
to
me
in
richmond
i
do
know
what
i
would
have
done
without
her
at
first
before
i
sairy

it
to
me
tom

drying
apples

touched
the

the
shoulder
very
gently
they
all
fools
christianna

i
met
a
woman

trembling
hands

it
carefully
atop
of
the
others
in
the
tin
box
and
took
off
and
wiped
his
glasses

the
slight
homespun
figure
disappeared
around
the
bend
of
the
road
sairy
sewed
in
silence
tom
went
back
to
the
newspaper
the
yellow
cat
slept
on
the
bees
buzzed
and
droned
the
sweet
mountain
air
brushed
through
the
trees
a
robin
sang
half
an
hour
passed
tom
raised
his
head
i
hear
some
one
coming
he
reached
for
the
tobacco
box
it
proved
to
be
an
old
country
doctor
on
a
white
horse
with
his
saddle
bags
before
him
sairy
hurried
out
too
to
the
gate
doctor
i
want
to
ask
you
something
about
tom
psha
i
all
right
said
tom
wo
you
get
down
and
set
a
little
doctor
the
doctor
would
and
did
and
after
he
had
prescribed
for
the
tollgate
keeper
a
two
hours
nap
every
day
and
not
to
get
too
excited
over
war
news
tom
read
him
allan
letter
and
they
got
into
a
hot
discussion
of
the
next
battle
sairy
turned
the
drying
apples
brushed
away
the
bees
and
brought
fresh
water
from
the
well
then
sat
down
again
with
her
mending
doctor
how
the
girl
at
three
oaks
the
doctor
came
back
from
maryland
to
his
own
county
and
to
the
fold
which
he
tended
without
sleep
without
rest
and
with
little
pay
save
in
loving
hearts
miriam
cleave
she
better
cole
she
better
i
mighty
glad
to
hear
it
said
sairy
ai
a
decline
then
no
no
just
shock
on
shock
coming
to
a
delicate
child
her
mother
will
bring
her
through
and
there
a
great
woman
that
so
that
so
assented
tom
cordially
a
great
woman
sairy
nodded
drawing
her
thread
across
a
bit
of
beeswax
for
once
you
are
both
right
he
is
there
now
doctor
no
he
was
there
but
a
week
or
two
you
do
no
tom
i
do
know
where
he
has
gone
they
have
some
land
in
the
far
south
down
somewhere
on
the
gulf
he
may
have
gone
there
i
reckon
said
tom
he
could
stand
it
in
virginia
all
the
earth
beginnin
to
tremble
under
marchin
feet
and
everybody
askin
the
army
i
reckon
he
could
stand
it
i
could
allan
believe
he
did
it
an
i
do
believe
it
either
nor
i
said
sairy
he
came
up
here
said
tom
just
as
quiet
an
grave
an
simple
as
you
or
me
an
he
sat
there
in
his
lawyer
clothes
with
his
back
to
that
thar
pillar
an
he
told
sairy
an
me
all
about
allan
he
told
us
how
good
he
was
an
how
all
the
men
loved
him
an
how
valuable
he
was
to
the
service
an
he
said
that
the
wound
he
got
at
gaines
mill
was
so
bad
after
all
as
it
might
have
been
and
that
allan
would
soon
be
rejoining
an
he
said
that
being
a
scout
was
as
glorious
maybe
but
it
was
just
as
necessary
as
being
a
general
an
that
he
had
always
loved
allan
an
always
would
an
he
told
us
about
something
allan
did
at
mcdowell
and
then
again
at
kernstown
an
sairy
cried
an
so
did
i
sairy
folded
her
work
i
was
crying
so
much
for
allan
an
then
he
asked
for
a
drink
of
water
we
talked
a
little
about
the
crops
he
went
down
the
mountain
an
sairy
an
i
do
believe
he
did
it
the
doctor
drew
his
hand
downward
over
mouth
and
white
beard
well
cole
i
do
either
the
decisions
of
courts
and
judges
always
decide
there
always
a
chance
of
an
important
witness
called
truth
having
been
absent
i
did
see
richard
cleave
but
once
while
he
was
at
three
oaks
he
looked
and
acted
then
just
like
richard
cleave
only
older
and
graver
it
was
beautiful
to
see
him
and
his
mother
together
the
doctor
rose
but
i
reckon
it
as
tom
says
and
he
could
stand
it
and
has
gone
where
he
does
hear
army
the
army
the
army
all
day
long
cleave
has
said
anything
and
i
would
ask
the
last
time
i
saw
her
and
i
think
he
had
just
gone
she
looked
like
a
woman
a
great
artist
might
have
met
in
a
dream
the
doctor
gazed
out
over
the
autumn
sea
of
mountains
and
up
at
the
pure
serene
of
the
heavens
and
then
at
his
old
patient
white
horse
with
the
saddle
bags
across
the
saddle
cole
all
you
got
to
do
is
to
keep
tom

the
doctor
rode
on
down
the
mountain
tom
and
sairy
had
a
frugal
dinner
then
the
former
lay
down
to
take
the
prescribed
nap
and
the
latter
set
her
washtub
on
a
box
in
the
yard
beneath
the
peach
trees
tom
sleep
long
he
said
every
time
he
was
about
to
drop
off

thought
he
heard
wheels
he
came
back
to
his
chair
on
the
porch
the
tobacco
box
for
the
toll
the
tin
box
with
allan
letters
and
the
view
across
the
china
asters
of
the
road
the
afternoon
was
past
its
height
but
bright
yet
with
the
undersong
of
the
wind
and
of
thunder
run
the
yellow
cat
had
had
his
dinner
too
and
after
sauntering
around
the
yard
and
observing
the
robin
on
the
locust
tree
again
curled
himself
on
the
porch
and
slept
sairy

from
the
washtub
somebody
comin
up
the
road

a

and
crinkled
upon
her
apron

a
soldier
tom
maybe
one
of
the
boys

too
quickly

staggered
and

to

at
the
sapling
that

the
pillar

they

tom
cole

that
he
had
no
opinion

sairy
pursed
her
lips
but
a
soldier

a
soldier
steve

and

down
on

edge
of

porch
beside
the
china
asters

i
been
through
chapter
xlii
special
orders
no
in
lee
tent
pitched
in
a
grove
a
mile
from
frederick
was
held
a
council
of
war
lee
stonewall
jackson
longstreet
jeb
stuart
lee
sat
beside
the
table
jackson
faced
him
sabre
across
knees
longstreet
had
his
place
a
little
to
one
side
and
stuart
stood
his
shoulder
against
the
tent
pole
the
had
been
speaking
he
now
ended
with
i
think
i
may
say
sir
that
hardly
a
rabbit
has
gotten
past
my
pickets
he
a
fine
fellow
little
mac
is
but
he
mighty
cautious
and
you
could
exactly
call
him
swift
as
lightning
he
still
a
score
of
miles
to
the
east
of
us
and
he
knows
mighty
little
what
we
are
about
jackson
spoke
general
mcclellan
does
not
know
if
the
whole
army
has
crossed
or
only
part
of
it
has
crossed
he
does
not
know
whether
we
are
going
to
move
against
washington
or
move
against
baltimore
or
invade
pennsylvania
always
mystify
mislead
and
deceive
the
enemy
as
far
as
possible
longstreet
spoke
well
by
the
time
he
makes
those
twenty
miles
the
troops
should
be
rested
and
in
condition
we
have
another
battle
and
another
victory
lee
spoke
addressing
stuart
you
have
done
your
work
most
skilfully
general
it
is
not
every
army
that
has
a
jeb
stuart
he
paused
then
spoke
to
all
mcclellan
will
not
be
up
for
several
days
across
the
river
in
virginia
are
yet
fourteen
thousand
of
the
enemy
i
had
hoped
that
scattered
as
they
are
washington
would
withdraw
them
when
it
heard
of
our
crossing
it
has
not
done
so
however
it
is
not
well
to
have
in
our
rear
that
entrenched
camp
at
harper
ferry
it
is
my
idea
gentlemen
that
it
might
be
possible
to
repeat
the
manoeuvre
of
second
manassas
stonewall
jackson
hitched
his
chair
closer
stuart
chuckled
joyously
longstreet
looked
dubious
do
you
mean
general
that
you
would
again
divide
the
army
lee
rested
his
crossed
hands
on
the
table
before
him
gentlemen
did
i
have
the
northern
generals
numbers
i
too
might
be
cautious
having
only
robert
lee
numbers
i
advance
another
policy
it
is
my
idea
again
to
divide
the
army
in
the
enemy
country
we
have
not
thousand
fighting
strength
yes
in
the
enemy
country
and
i
know
that
we
have
not
thousand
fighting
strength
my
plan
is
this
gentlemen
general
stuart
has
proved
his
ability
to
hold
all
roads
and
mask
all
movements
we
will
form
two
columns
and
behind
the
screen
which
his
cavalry
provides
one
column
will
move
north
and
one
column
will
move
south
by
advancing
toward
hagerstown
the
first
will
create
the
impression
that
pennsylvania
is
to
be
invaded
moreover
catoctin
and
south
mountain
are
strong
defensive
positions
the
other
column
will
move
with
expedition
recrossing
the
potomac
it
will
invest
and
capture
harper
ferry
that
done
it
will
return
at
once
into
maryland
rejoining
me
before
mcclellan
is
up
longstreet
swore
by
god
that
is
a
bold
plan
what
if
mcclellan
should
learn
it
as
against
that
we
must
trust
in
general
stuart
these
people
must
be
driven
out
of
harper
ferry
all
our
communications
are
threatened
longstreet
was
blunt
well
sir
i
think
it
is
madness
pray
do
send
me
on
any
such
errand
lee
smiled
general
jackson
what
is
your
opinion
jackson
spoke
with
brevity
i
might
prefer
sir
to
attack
mcclellan
first
and
then
turn
upon
harper
ferry
but
i
see
no
madness
in
the
other
plan
if
the
movement
is
rapid
sometimes
to
be
bold
is
the
sanest
thing
you
can
do
it
is
necessary
of
course
that
the
enemy
should
be
kept
in
darkness
then
general
you
will
undertake
the
reduction
of
harper
ferry
if
you
order
me
to
do
it
sir
i
will
do
it
very
good
you
will
start
at
dawn
besides
your
own
you
shall
have
mclaws
and
anderson
divisions
the
remainder
of
the
army
will
leave
frederick
an
hour
or
two
later
colonel
chilton
will
at
once
issue
the
order
of
march
he
drew
a
piece
of
paper
toward
him
and
with
a
pencil
made
a
memorandum
special
orders
no
the
remainder
of
the
ninth
of
september
passed
the
tenth
of
september
passed
and
the
eleventh
mild
balmy
and
extremely
still
the
twelfth
found
the
landscape
for
miles
around
frederick
still
dozing
at
noon
however
upon
this
day
things
changed
mcclellan
strong
cavalry
advance
came
into
touch
with
jeb
stuart
a
league
or
two
to
the
east
there
ensued
a
skirmish
approaching
in
dignity
to
an
engagement
finally
the
grey
drew
off
though
not
to
the
federal
surprise
in
the
direction
of
frederick
instead
they
galloped
north
the
blue
advance
trotted
on
sabre
to
hand
ready
for
the
dash
into
frederick
pierced
at
last
was
the
grey
movable
screen
now
with
the
infantry
close
behind
with
the
magnificent
artillery
rumbling
up
with
mcclellan
grim
from
the
seven
days
now
for
the
impact
which
should
wipe
out
the
memory
of
the
defeat
of
a
fortnight
ago
of
the
second
bull
run
an
impact
that
should
grind
rebellion
small
they
came
to
frederick
and
found
a
quiet
shell
there
was
no
one
there
to
sabre
information
abounded
mcclellan
riding
in
with
his
staff
toward
evening
found
himself
in
a
sandstorm
of
news
through
which
nothing
could
be
distinctly
observed
prominent
citizens
were
brought
before
him
yes
general
they
undoubtedly
went
north
yes
sir
the
morning
of
the
tenth
two
columns
but
starting
one
just
after
the
other
and
on
the
same
road
yes
sir
some
of
our
younger
men
did
follow
on
horseback
after
an
hour
or
two
they
could
just
see
the
columns
still
moving
north
then
they
ran
against
stuart
cordon
and
they
had
to
turn
back
frederick
been
just
like
a
desert
island
nobody
coming
and
nobody
getting
away
for
all
he
as
frisky
as
a
puppy
jeb
stuart
a
mighty
good
watch
dog
mcclellan
laughed
stuart
i
wish
i
had
him
here
he
grew
grave
again

general
jackson
purposes

answer
you

recent
maps
also
i

i
said
and
i
got
thim
down
rather
disappointed
having
thought
him
interested
in
colonial
maryland
and
maybe
in
the
location
of
missions
do
you

i
still
polite
though
i
had
lost
interest
map
of
pennsylvania
said
he

map
of
pennsylvania
ames
get
your
notebook
there
and
i
unrolled
it
and
he
looked
at
it
hard
road
to
waynesboro
he
said
and
says
i
my
son
fair
and
says
he
may
take
this
map
to
general
jackson
said
i
i
hope
you
soon
be
so
good
as
to
return
it
will
said
he
said
i
ribils
are
right
good
at
returning
things
i
say
that
for
you
said
i
and
he
rolled
up
the
map
and
put
it
under
his
arm
the
general
drew
a
long
breath
pennsylvania
invaded
by
way
of
waynesboro
i
am
much
obliged
father
wait
wait
my
son
i
not
done
yet
and
thin
says
he
jackson
wants
a
map
of
the
country
due
east
from
here
one
says
he
shows
the
roads
to
baltimore
baltimore
you
got
that
one
says
he
says
i
and
unrolled
it
and
he
looked
at
it
carefully
and
long
see
says
he
by
going
north
from
frederick
to
double
pipe
creek
you
would
strike
there
the
turnpike
running
east
thank
you
father
may
i
take
this
one
too
and
he
rolled
it
up
and
put
it
under
his
arm
baltimore
said
mcclellan
baltimore
now
father
says
he
you
one
of
the
region
between
here
and
washington
do
be
afther
apologizing
general
there
are
times
when
i
want
a
strong
word
meself
so
i
got
that
map
too
and
he
looked
at
it
steadily
understand
says
he
going
west
by
north
you
would
strike
a
road
that
leads
you
south
again
thrue
said
i
and
he
looked
at
the
map
long
and
steadily
again
and
he
asked
what
was
the
precise
distance
from
point
of
rocks
to
washington
point
of
rocks
good
lord
ames
get
ready
to
take
these
telegrams
and
thin
he
said
i
have
this
too
father
and
he
rolled
it
up
and
said
general
jackson
would
certainly
be
obliged
and
would
return
thim
in
good
order
which
he
did
and
thin
he
took
up
his
cap
and
sword
and
said
good
avenin
and
went
that
all
that
i
know
of
the
matter
general
saving
and
excepting
that
the
ribil
columns
certainly
next
morning
with
their
faces
toward
the
great
state
of
pennsylvania
do
mention
it
general
though
if
you
are
interested
in
good
works
and
i
not
doubting
the
same
there
an
orphan
asylum
here
having
arrived
at
a
without
a
signpost
mcclellan
characteristically
hesitated
the
activity
of
the
next
twelve
hours
was
principally
electrical
and
travelled
by
wire
from
frederick
to
washington
and
washington
to
frederick
the
cavalry
indeed
was
pushed
forward
toward
boonsboro
but
for
the
remainder
of
the
army
as
it
came
up
corps
by
corps
the
night
passed
in
inaction
and
morning
dawned
on
inaction
march
north
toward
pennsylvania
and
leave
washington
to
be
bombarded
turn
south
and
east
toward
washington
and
hear
a
cry
of
protest
and
anger
from
an
invaded
state
turn
due
east
to
baltimore
and
be
awakened
by
the
enemy
cannon
thundering
against
the
other
sides
of
the
figure
leave
baltimore
out
of
the
calculation
and
lose
perhaps
the
whole
of
maryland
mcclellan
was
disturbed
enough
and
then
in
the
great
drama
of
real
life
there
occurred
an
incident
an
aide
appeared
in
the
doorway
of
the
room
in
which
were
gathered
mcclellan
and
several
of
his
generals
the
discussion
had
been
a
heated
one
all
the
men
looked
haggard
disturbed
what
is
it
asked
mcclellan
sharply
the
aide
held
something
in
his
hand
this
has
just
been
found
sir
it
seems
to
have
been
dropped
at
a
street
corner
leaves
and
rubbish
had
been
blown
over
it
the
soldier
who
found
it
brought
it
here
he
thought
it
important
and
i
think
it
is
sir
he
crossed
the
floor
and
gave
it
to
the
general
three
cigars
wrapped
in
a
piece
of
paper
why
what
a
piece
of
paper
wrapped
around
three
cigars
open
the
shutters
more
widely

drove

in

were
farmers
ploughing
in
the

gathering

they
stopped
and
stared

half
of

barefoot

the

stacked

broke

in

rolling
autumn
fields
and

a
mile
or
two
ahead
was
the
village
of
boonsboro
jackson
sent
forward
to
make
enquiries
major
kyd
douglas
of
his
staff
that
officer
took
a
cavalryman
with
him
and
trotted
off
the
little
place
looked
like
a
sweet
auburn
of
the
vale
so
tranquilly
innocent
did
it
lie
beneath
the
rosy
west
the
two
officers
commented
upon
it
and
the
next
moment
ran
into
a
federal
cavalry
company
sent
to
sweet
auburn
from
hancock
for
forage
or
recruits
or
some
such
matter
the
blue
troopers
set
up
a
huzzah
and
charged
the
two
in
grey
turned
and
dug
spur
past
ran
the
fields
past
ran
the
woods
the
thundering
pursuit
fired
its
revolvers
the
grey
turned
in
saddle
and
emptied
theirs
then
bent
head
to
horse
neck
and
plied
the
spur
before
them
the
road
mounted
pass
the
hill
and
we
are
safe
pass
the
hill
and
we
are
safe
thought
the
grey
and
the
spur
drew
blood
behind
came
the
blue
a
dozen
troopers
stop
there
you
damned
rebels
stop
there
if
you
do
when
we
catch
you
we
cut
you
to
pieces
almost
at
the
hilltop
one
of
the
grey
uttered
a
cry
good
god
the
general
stonewall
jackson
was
coming
toward
them
he
was
walking
apparently
in
deep
thought
and
leading
little
sorrel
he
was
quite
alone
the
two
officers
shouted
they
saw
him
look
up
take
in
the
situation
and
put
his
hand
on
the
saddle
bow
then
to
give
him
time
the
two
turned
yaaiih
yaaaaiiahh
they
yelled
and
charged
the
enemy
the
blue
taken
by
surprise
misinterpreted
the
first
shout
and
the
ensuing
action
there
must
of
course
be
coming
over
the
hill
a
grey
force
detached
on
some
reconnoissance
or
other
from
the
rebel
horde
known
to
be
reposing
at
frederick
presumably
it
would
be
cavalry
and
coming
at
a
gallop
to
stop
to
cut
down
these
two
yelling
grey
devils
might
be
to
invite
destruction
the
blue
troopers
first
emptied
their
revolvers
then
wheeled
horse
and
retired
to
sweet
auburn
out
of
which
a
little
later
the
grey
cavalry
did
indeed
drive
them
in
the
last
of
the
rosy
light
the
two
officers
now
again
at
the
hilltop
saw
the
camp
outspread
below
it
and
coming
at
a
double
quick
the
regiment
which
jackson
had
sent
to
the
rescue
one
checked
his
horse
what
that
asked
the
other
the
general
gloves
he
dropped
them
when
he
mounted
he
stooped
from
his
horse
and
gathered
them
up
later
back
in
camp
he
went
to
headquarters
jackson
was
talking

with
his
chief
of

gleaming
a
little
in

a
week
ago
upon

crossing
of
the
potomac
you

certain
sir
that

come
to
beg
sir
that
i
may
be
released
from
arrest
till
the
battle
is
over
stonewall
jackson
sitting
stiffly
looked
at
the
other
standing
tense
energetic
before
him
something
stole
into
his
face
that
without
being
a
smile
was
like
a
smile
it
gave
a
strange
effect
of
mildness
tenderness
it
was
gone
almost
as
soon
as
it
had
come
but
it
had
been
there
i
can
understand
your
feeling
sir
he
said
a
battle

he
himself
made
a

and
came
upon

from

west
the
hundred

could
retire

a
thing
hardly
to

they

themselves
into

as
was

they
chose
the

course
stonewall
jackson
entered

amid

here
he

small
country
churches
the
prince
of
peace
if
he
indwelled
here
must
have
bowed
his
head
and
mourned
sunrise
struck
upon
its
white
walls
then
came
a
shell
and
pierced
them
the
church
became
the
core
of
the
turmoil
the
white
still
reef
against
which
beat
the
wild
seas
in
storm
fighting
joe
hooker
came
out
of
the
north
wood
his
battle
flags
were
bright
and
he
had
drums
and
brazen
horns
loud
and
in
time
regular
as
a
beat
in
music
came
the
huzzah
huzzah
of
his
fourteen
thousand
men
he
crossed
the
turnpike
he
came
down
on
the
dunkard
church
yaii
yaaaii
yaaaaaaaaiihhh
yelled
the
grey
sea
no
time
at
all
only
fierce
determination
sometimes
a
grey
drum
beat
or
bugle
called
but
there
was
no
other
music
save
the
thunder
of
the
guns
and
the
long
rattle
never
ceasing
of
the
musketry
there
were
battle
flags
squares
of
crimson
with
a
starry
andrew
cross
they
went
forward
they
shrank
back
were
killed
gaunt
hands
caught
at
the
staves
lifted
them
the
went
forward
again
doubleday
struck
and
ricketts
they
charged
against
stonewall
jackson
and
the
narrow
grey
sea
all
the
ground
was
broken
alignment
was
lost
blue
waves
and
grey
went
this
way
and
that
in
a
broken
tumultuous
fray
but
the
blue
waves
were
the
heavier
in
mass
alone
they
outdid
the
grey
they
pushed
the
grey
sea
back
back
back
toward
the
dark
wood
about
the
dunkard
church
then
stonewall
jackson
came
along
the
front
riding
in
a
pelting
leaden
rain
steady
men
steady
god
is
over
us
his
men
received
him
with
a
cry
of
greeting
and
enthusiasm
that
was
like
a
shriek
it
was
so
wild
and
high
his
power
upon
them
had
grown
and
grown
he
was
stonewall
jackson
he
was
stonewall
jackson
first
they
would
die
for
those
and
the
cause
they
represented
second
they
would
die
for
one
another
comrades
brethren
third
they
would
die
for
stonewall
jackson
they
lifted
their
voices
for
him
now
gaunt
and
ragged
troops
with
burning
eyes
jackson

jackson

virginia
virginia
the

the

he
turned
his
horse
standing
in
the
whistling
leaden
rain
forward
and
drive
them
lawton
and
hill
leaped
against
meade
he
was
a
staunch
fighter
but
he
gave
back
the
wood
about
the
dunkard
church
appeared
to
writhe
like
dante
wood
it
was
so
full
of
groaning
of
maimed
men
beside
the
tree
trunks
the
dead
lay
where
they
fell
and
the
living
stepped
upon
them
meade
gave
back
back
and
then
mansfield
came
in
thunder
to
reinforce
the
blue
the
grey
fought
as
even
in
this
war
they
had
hardly
fought
before
they
were
so
gaunt
they
were
so
ragged
they
were
so
tired
but
something
ethnic
was
coming
more
and
more
rapidly
to
the
front
they
were
near
again
to
savage
nature
the
maryland
woods
might
have
been
thicker
darker
the
small
church
might
have
been
some
boulder
altar
beside
some
early
old
world
river
they
were
a
tribe
again
and
they
were
fighting
another
and
much
larger
tribe
whom
they
had
reason
reason
reason
to
hate
their
existence
was
at
stake
and
the
existence
of
all
that
their
hearts
held
dear
they
fought
with
fury
about
each
were
his
tribesmen
all
were
brothers
brother
fought
for
brother
brother
saw
brother
fall
brother
sprang
to
avenge
brother
their
lips
were
blackened
from
tearing
cartridges
their
eyes
large
in
their
thin
bronzed
faces
burned
against
the
enemy
their
fingers
were
quick
quick
at
the
musket
lock
the
spirit
was
the
spirit
behind
hurled
stones
of
old
swung
clubs
thrown
javelins
they
had
a
loved
leader
a
great
strong
head
man
who
ruled
them
well
and
led
them
on
to
victory
they
fought
for
him
too
for
his
scant
and
curt
praise
for
his
good
good
they
fought
for
their
own
lives
each
man
for
his
own
life
for
their
tribe
their
possessions
for
women
at
home
and
children
for
their
brethren
their
leader
their
cause
something
else
too
of
the
past
was
there
in
force
hatred
of
him
who
opposed
they
fought
for
hate
at
sharpsburg
as
they
fought
for
love
the
great
star
drew
the
iron
thong
fell
led
and
driven
the
tribe
fought
gigantically
the
battle
became
furious
within
the
din
of
artillery
and
musketry
human
voices
loud
imperative
giving
orders
shouting
wailing
died
like
a
low
murmur
in
the
blast
out
of
the
wildly
drifting
smoke
now
dark
now
forms
emerged
singly
or
in
great
bodies
then
the
smoke
drew
together
hiding
the
struggle
there
was
blackness
and
grime
as
from
the
ash
of
a
volcano
the
blood
pounded
behind
the
temples
the
eyeballs
started
the
tongue
was
thick
in
the
mouth
battle
smell
and
battle
taste
a
red
light
and
time
in
crashes
like
an
city
the
inequalities
of
the
ground
became
exaggerated
mere
hillocks
changed
into
rocky
islands
seize
them
fortify
them
take
them
before
the

the
tall
maize
grew
gigantically
taller
break
through
these
miles
of
cane
as
often
before

broken
through

the

before

the

the

and
grinning
the

to

around

wood
and

filled
with
clangour
the

pressed
in

were
giving

were
giving

an
company
raised
a
cry
they
flanking
us
something
like

passed
over
the

then
grey
and
haggard
they
tore
another

stonewall
jackson
voice
came
from
behind
a

of

stand

there
are

on

from

ferry
it
is
general
mclaws
stand
fast
it
was
mclaws
with
his
black
bullet
head
his
air
of
a
roman
consul
in
he
thundered
with
his
hundred
men
tawny
with
the
dust
of
the
seventeen
miles
from
harper
ferry
he
struck
sedgwick
full
for
five
minutes
there
was
brazen
clangour
and
shouting
and
an
agony
of
effort
then
the
blue
streamed
back
past
the
dunkard
wood
and
church
back
into
the
dreadful
cornfield
maury
stafford
sent
with
a
statement
to
the
crossed
in
one
prolonged
risk
of
life
from
the
wild
left
to
the
only
less
centre
here
a
strong
blue
current
french
and
richardson
strove
against
a
staunch
grey
ledge
a
part
of
line
with
anderson
to
support
here
was
a
sunken
road
that
later
was
given
a
descriptive
name
here
was
the
bloody
lane
lee
was
found
standing
upon
a
knoll
calm
and
grand
i
yet
look
for
hill
he
said
he
has
a
talent
for
appearing
at
identically
the
right
moment
stafford
gave
his
statement
all
over
the
field
the
staff
had
suffered
heavily
some
were
dead
many
were
wounded
those
who
were
left
did
treble
duty
lee
sent
this
officer
on
to
longstreet
holding
the
long
ridge
on
the
right
stafford
rode
through
the
withering
storm
across
that
withered
field
there
seemed
no
light
from
the
sky
the
light
was
the
glare
from
the
guns
he
marked
through
a
rift
in
the
smoke
a
battery
where
it
stood
upon
a
height
above
felled
trees
he
thought
it
was
pelham
the
horse
artillery
it
stood
for
a
moment
outlined
against
the
cloud
then
like
an
army
of
wraiths
the
smoke
came
between
and
hid
it
his
horse
frightened
at
a
dead
man
in
his
path
the
start
and
plunging
were
unusual
and
the
rider
looked
to
see
the
reason
the
soldier
had
drawn
letters
from
his
breast
and
had
died
with
them
in
his
hands
the
unfolded
fluttering
sheets
stirred
as
though
they
had
life
stafford
riding
on
found
the
right
and
found
longstreet
looking
sombrely
like
an
old
eagle
from
his
eyrie
i
told
general
lee
he
said
that
we
ought
never
to
have
divided
i
do
see
hill
you
tell
general
lee
that
i
only
got
jones
and
the
knowledge
that
we
fight
like
hell
and
that
burnside
is
before
me
with
fourteen
thousand
men
stafford
retraced
his
way
the
ground
beneath
was
burned
and
scarred
the
battle
cloud
rolled
dark
the
minies
sang
beside
his
ear
now
he
was
in
a
barren
place
tasting
of
powder
smelling
of
smoke
now
lit
now
darkened
but
vacant
of
human
life
and
now
he
was
in
a
press
of
men
grey
forms
advancing
and
retreating
or
standing
firing
and
now
he
was
where
fighting
had
been
and
there
was
left
a
wrack
of
the
dead
and
dying
he
reached
the
centre
and
gave
his
message
then
turned
toward
the
left
again
a
few
yards
and
his
horse
was
killed
under
him
he
disengaged
himself
and
presently
caught
at
the
bridle
and
stayed
another
there
were
many
riderless
horses
on
the
field
of
sharpsburg
but
he
had
hardly
mounted
before
this
one
too
was
killed
he
went
on
afoot
he
entered
a
sunken
road
dropped
between
rough
banks
overhung
by
a
few
straggling
trees
the
road
was
filled
with
men
lying
down
all
in
shadow
beneath
the
rolling
battle
smoke
stafford
thought
it
a
regiment
waiting
for
orders
then
he
saw
that
they
were
all
dead
men
he
must
go
back
to
the
dunkard
wood
and
this
seemed
his
shortest
way
he
entered
the
lane
and
went
up
it
as
quickly
as
he
might
for
the
forms
that
lay
thick
in
the
discoloured
light
it
looked
as
though
the
earth
were
bleeding
and
all
the
people
were
fantastic
about
him
some
lay
as
straight
as
on
a
sculptured
tomb
and
some
were
hooped
and
some
lay
like
a
cross
and
some
were
headless
as
he
stepped
with
what
care
he
might
a
fierce
yelling
broke
out
on
the
side
that
was
the
grey
side
there
was
a
charge
coming
already
he
saw
the
red
squares
tossing
he
moved
to
the
further
side
of
the
sunken
road
and
braced
himself
against
the
bank
putting
his
arm
about
a
twisted
protruding
cedar
hill
north
carolinians
hung
a
moment
tall
gaunt
yelling
then
swooped
down
into
the
sunken
lane
passed
over
the
dead
mounted
the
other
ragged
bank
and
went
on
stafford
waited
to
hear
the
shock
it
came
full
against
a
deep
blue
wave
richardson
had
been
killed
and
hancock
commanded
here
the
blue
wave
was
strong
the
sound
of
the
melee
was
frightful
then
out
of
it
burst
a
loud
huzzahing
stafford
straightened
himself
the
grey
were
coming
back
and
after
them
the
blue
almost
before
he
could
unclasp
his
arm
from
the
cedar
the
first
spray
of
gaunt
exhausted
bleeding
men
came
over
and
down
into
the
sunken
lane
all
the
grey
wave
followed
at
the
moment
there
outburst
a
renewed
and
tremendous
artillery
battle
the
smoke
drifting
across
the
bloody
lane
was
like
the
fall
of
night
a
night
of
cloud
and
storm
orange
flashes
momentarily
lit
the
scene
and
the
sullen
thunders
rolled
the
grey
gaunt
and
haggard
but
their
colours
with
them
overpassed
the
dead
and
wounded
now
choking
the
sunken
road
behind
them
were
heard
the
blue
advancing
and
huzzahing
the
grey
wave
remounted
the
bank
down
which
it
plunged
fifteen
minutes
before
at
the
top
it
stayed
a
moment
thin
and
grey
spectral
in
the
smoke
pall
the
battle
flags
like
hovering
crimson
birds
a
line
of
flame
leaped
one
long
crackle
of
musketry
then
it
resumed
its
retreat
falling
back
on
the
west
wood
the
blue
checked
a
moment
by
that
last
volley
now
poured
down
into
the
sunken
road
overpassed
the
thick
ranks
of
the
dead
and
wounded
mounted
and
swept
on
in
a
counter
charge
maury
stafford
had
left
the
cedar
and
started
across
with
the
last
broken
line
of
the
grey
going
down
the
crumbling
bank
his
spur
caught
in
a
gnarled
and
sprawling
root
the
check
was
absolute
and
brought
him
violently
to
his
knees
before
he
could
free
himself
the
grey
had
reached
the
opposite
crest
fired
its
volley
and
gone
on
he
started
to
follow
he
heard
the
blue
coming
and
it
was
expedient
to
get
out
of
this
trap
before
him
from
the
figures
covering
the
earth
like
thrown
jackstraws
an
arm
was
suddenly
lifted
the
hand
clutched
at
him
passing
he
looked
down
it
was
a
boy
of
nineteen
with
a
ghastly
face
the
voice
came
up
whoever
you
are
you
alive
and
well
and
dying
you
take
it
and
put
a
stamp
on
it
and
mail
it
wo
you
dying
people
ought
to
do
things
when
the
dying
ask
them
to
stafford
looked
behind
him
then
down
again
do
what
quick
coming
the
hand
would
not
relax
its
clasp
but
its
fellow
fumbled
at
the
grey
jacket
it
my
letter
they
wo
know
if
they
do
get
it
my
side
hurts
but
it
do
hurt
like
knowing
they
wo
know
that
i
was
sorry
the
face
worked
it
here
but
i
ca
please
get
it
you
must
let
me
go
said
stafford
and
tried
to
unclasp
the
hand
stay
any
longer
and
i
will
be
killed
or
taken
the
hand
closed
desperately
both
hands
now
for
god
sake
i
believe
you
got
so
hard
a
heart
take
it
and
stamp
it
and
mail

if
they
do
know
they
never
understand
and
i
die
knowing

for
god
sake
stafford
knelt
beside
him
opened
the
grey
jacket
and
took
out
the
letter
blood
was
upon
it
but
the
address
was
legible
die
easy
stamp
and
mail
it
i
will
send
a
word
with
it
too
if
you
like
a
light
came
into
the
boy
face
tell
them
that
i
was
like
the
prodigal
son
but
that
i
going
home
i
going
home
the
arms
fell
the
breast
ceased
to
heave
the
head
drew
backward
death
came
and
stamped
the
light
upon
the
face
before
stafford
could
get
to
his
feet
the
blue
wave
had
plunged
into
the
trough
he
remembered
using
his
pistol
and
he
remembered
a
dizziness
of
being
borne
backward
he
remembered
that
a
phrase
had
gone
through
his
mind
the
instability
of
all
material
things
then
came
a
blank
he
did
not
assume
that
he
had
lost
consciousness
but
simply
he
could
not
remember
he
had
been
wrecked
in
a
turbulent
hostile
ocean
it
had
made
him
and
others
captives
and
now
they
were
together
at
a
place
which
he
remembered
was
called
the
roulette
house
an
hour
might
have
passed
two
hours
he
really
could
not
tell
there
were
a
number
of
prisoners
most
of
them
badly
wounded
they
lay
in
the
back
yard
of
the
place
on
the
steps
of
with
blue
soldiers
for
guards
a
surgeon
came
through
the
yard
and
helped
a
little
the
more
agonizedly
hurt
he
glanced
at
stafford
star
and
sash
came
across
and
offered
to
bind
up
the
cut
across
his
forehead
an
awful
field
he
said
this
war
is
getting
horrible
you
a
virginian
are
you
yes
used
to
know
a
lot
of
virginia
doctors
liked
them
first
rate
now
we
are
enemies
and
it
seems
to
me
a
pity
guess
it
as
shakespeare
says
fools
these
mortals
be
i
know
war
getting
to
seem
to
me
an
awful
foolishness
that
cornfield
out
there
is
sickening
now
that
bleeding
stopped
on
the
left
around
and
before
the
dunkard
church
the
very
fury
of
the
storm
brought
about
at
last
a
sudden
failing
a
stillness
and
cessation
that
seemed
like
those
of
death
sound
enough
there
was
undoubtedly
and
in
the
centre
the
battle
yet
roared
but
by
comparison
there
seemed
a
dark
and
sultry
calm
far
and
near
lay
the
fallen
it
was
now
noon
and
since
dawn
twelve
thousand
men
had
been
killed
or
wounded
on
this
left
attacked
by
fighting
joe
hooker
held
by
stonewall
jackson
fifteen
general
officers
were
dead
or
disabled
hardly
a
brigade
not
many
regiments
were
officered
as
they
had
been
when
the
sun
rose
there
was
an
exhaustion
franklin
had
entered
on
the
field
and
one
might
have
thought
that
the
grey
would
yet
be
overpowered
but
all
the
blue
forces
were
broken
disorganized
there
came
an
exhaustion
a
lassitude
mcclellan
sent
an
order
forbidding
another
attack
cornfield
and
wood
lay
heavy
hot
and
dark
and
by
comparison
still
stonewall
jackson
sat
little
sorrel
near
the
dunkard
church
they
brought
him
reports
of
the
misery
of
the
wounded
and
their
great
numbers
his
medical
director
of
whom
he
was
fond
came
to
him
general
it
is
very
bad
the
field
hospital
looks
as
though
all
the
fields
of
the
world
had
given
tribute
i
know
that
you
do
not
like
hospitals
but
would
you
come
and
look
sir
the
general
shook
his
head
what
is
the
use
of
looking
there
have
to
be
wounded
do
the
utmost
that
you
can
doctor
i
have
thought
sir
that
seeing
the
day
is
not
ended
and
they
are
so
overwhelmingly
in
force
and
the
potomac
is
not
three
miles
in
our
rear
i
have
thought
that
we
might
manage
to
get
the
less
badly
hurt
across
if
they
attack
again
and
the
day
should
end
in
defeat
what
have
you
got
there
asked
jackson
apples
yes
sir
i
passed
beneath
a
tree
and
gathered
half
a
dozen
would
you
like
yes
i
breakfasted
very
early
he
took
the
rosy
fruit
and
began
to
eat
his
eyes
just
glinting
under
the
forage
cap
surveyed
the
scene
before
him
trampled
wood
where
the
shells
had
cut
through
bough
and
branch
trampled
cornfields
where
it
seemed
that
a
whirlwind
had
passed
his
resting
shattered
commands
the
dead
and
the
dying
the
dead
horses
the
disabled
guns
the
drifting
sulphurous
smoke
and
across
the
turnpike
in
the
fields
and
by
the
east
wood
the
masses
of
blue
overcanopied
also
by
sulphurous
smoke
he
finished
the
apple
took
out
a
handkerchief
and
wiped
fingers
and
lips
mcguire
they
have
done
their
worst
and
never
use
the
word
defeat
he
jerked
his
hand
into
the
air
do
your
best
for
the
wounded
doctor
do
all
that
is
humanly
possible
but
do
it
i
am
going
now
to
the
centre
to
see
general
lee
behind
the
wood
in
a
grassy
hollow
moderately
sheltered
from
the
artillery
fire
at
the
edge
of
the
ghastly
field
hospital
a
young
surgeon
sleeves
rolled
up
and
blood
from
head
to
foot
met
the
medical
director
doctor
the
virginia
legion

on
with

brought
their
colonel

straightened
himself
on
the
boards
where
the
men
had
laid
him
sedgwick
too
sedgwick
and
i
striking
at
each
other
like
two
savages
decked
with
beads
and
scalps
fratricidal
strife
if

there
was
fratricidal
strife
all

fair
quantity

amount

could
use
now
the
man
stretched
on
the
boards
motioned
with
the
hand
that
had
not
been
torn
by
the
exploding
shell
no

i
do
want

for
some
one
with
a
leg

charming
twisted
smile

into
a
grimace
of
pain

as

my
edward

for
the
next
all
right
i
ready
on
the
knoll
by
sharpsburg
lee
and
jackson
stood
and
looked
toward
the
right
mcclellan
had
apparently
chosen
to
launch
three
battles
in
one
day
in
the
early
morning
against
the
confederate
left
at
midday
against
its
centre
now
against
its
right
a
message
came
from
longstreet
burnside
is
in
motion
i
got
jones
and
hundred
men
it
was
evident
that
burnside
was
in
motion
with
fourteen
thousand
men
he
came
over
the
stone
bridge
across
the
antietam
they
were
fresh
troops
their
flags
were
flying
their
drums
were
beating
their
bugles
braying
the
line
moved
with
huzzahs
toward
the
ridge
held
by
longstreet
from
the
left
came
tearing
past
the
knoll
the
confederate
batteries
lee
was
massing
them
in
the
centre
training
them
against
the
eastern
foot
of
the
ridge
there
had
been
a
lull
in
the
storm
now
pelham
opened
with
loud
thunders
other
guns
followed
the
federal
batteries
began
to
blaze
there
broke
out
a
madness
of
sound
in
the
midst
of
it
jones
with
his
hundred
men
clashed
with
burnside
leading
brigades
stonewall
jackson
pulled
the
forage
cap
lower
jerked
his

into
the

all
upon
the

turned
and
gazed
air
and
light
played
with
the

smoke
drove
it
somewhat
to
one
side
and
showed
for
a
few
seconds
a
long
and
sunlit
road
the
road
from
harper
ferry
one
of
the
staff
began
a
low
uncontrollable
laughter
by
god
i
see
his
red

by

i
see
his
red

lee
with
a
glance
checked
the
sound
he
himself
looked
nobly
lifted
grave
and
thankful
the
battle
smoke
closed
obscuring
the
road
but
the
sound
of
marching
men
came
along
it
distinguishable
even
beneath
the
artillery
fire
good
good
said
jackson
hill
is
a
good
soldier
tawny
with
the
dust
of
the
seventeen
miles
at
a
double

yelling
the

slanting
forward

swung
the
light
division
jones
rallied
decimated
but
dangerous
the
aiding
regiments
from
the
left
did
well
the
grey
guns
worked
with
a
certain
swift
and
steadfast
grimness
from
all
the
ridges
of
the
antietam
the
blue
cannon
thundered
thundered
blue
and
grey
the

rose
into
terrific

the

artillery

the

now
upon

the

occupied
a

like
a
headland
jutting
into
a
grassy
field
below
above
behind
the

rolled
in

the
flame
leaped
from
their
guns
the

was
a
great
background
of
battle
cloud
lit
every
ten
seconds
by
the
glare
from
an
opposing
battery
john
pelham
stood
directing
six
guns
were
in
fierce
and
continuous
action
the
men
serving
them
were
picked
artillery
men
to
and
fro
they
moved
down
they
stooped
up
they

stepped
backward
from
the

at

moved
forward
at
recoil
fell
again
to
the
loading
with
the
precision
of
the
drill
ground
they
were
half
naked
they
were
black
with
powder
glistening
with
sweat
some
were
bleeding
in
the
light
from
the
guns
all
came
boldly
into
relief
in
the
intermediate
deep
murk
they
sank
from
sight
became
of
the
clouds
cloudy
mere
shapes
in
the
stonewall
jackson
returning
to
the
dunkard
church
and
passing
behind
this
headland
turned
little
sorrel
head
and
came
upon
the
plateau

met
him
yes

we
doing
well
yes

it
holding
out
caissons
were
partly
filled
during
the

said
jackson
he
dismounted
and
walked
forward
to
the
guns
pelham
followed
i
do
think
you
should
be
out
here
general
they
got
our
range
very
accurately
the
other
apparently
did
not
notice
the
remark
he
stood
near
one
of
the
guns
and
turned
his
eyes
upon
the

on
the

strikes
a

he
and

will
push

back
colonel

at
the

pelham
moved
toward
the
further
guns
the
howitzer
nearest
jackson
was
fired
reloaded
fired
again
the
men
beside
it
stood
back
it
blazed
thundered
recoiled
a
great
black
cylindrical
shell
came
with
a
demoniac
shriek
at
the
moment
the
platform
was
lit
with
the
battle
glare
its
fall
was
seen
it
fell
smoking
immediately
beside
stonewall
jackson
such
was
the
concussion
of
the
air
that
for
a
moment
he
was
stunned
involuntarily
his
arm
went
up
before
his
eyes
he
made
a
backward
step
pelham
returning
from
the
further
guns
and
still
some
yards
away
gave
a
shout
of
warning
and
horror
from
all
the
men
who
had
seen
the
thing
there
burst
a
similar
cry
with
the
motion
almost
of
the
shell
itself
a
man
of
the
crew
of
the
howitzer
reached
the
torn
earth
and
the
cylinder
his
body
half
naked
blackened
brushed
in
passing
the
general
he
put
his
hands
beneath
the
heated
smoking
bottle
of
death
lifted
it
and
rushed
on
to
the
edge
of
the
escarpment
fifty
feet
away
here
he
swung
it
with
force
threw
it
from
him
with
burned
hands
halfway
to
the
field
below
it
exploded
pelham
very
pale
protested
with
some
sternness
you
ca
stay
here
general
my
men
ca

you
here
it
does
matter
about
us
but
it
does
matter

the
man
who
took
up
the
shell
pelham
turned
to
the
howitzer
which
of
you
was
it
half
a
dozen
voices
were
raised
in
answer
deaderick
sir
but
he
burned
his
hands
badly
and
he
asked
the
lieutenant
if
he
could
go
to
the
rear
good
good
said
stonewall
jackson
he
did
well
but
there
are
many
brave
men
in
this
army
he
went
back
to
little
sorrel
where
he
stood
cropping
the
dried
grass
and
stiffly
mounted
as
he
turned
from
the
platform
and
the
guns
all
lit
again
by
the
orange
glare
there
came
from
the
right
an
accession
of
sound
then
high
shrill
and
triumphant
the
confederate
yell
a
shout
arose
from
the

a
triumph

for

the
bloody
prolonged
and
indecisive
struggle
blue
and
grey
one
hundred
and
thirty
thousand
men
fought
that
battle
when
the
pale
moon
came
up
she
looked
on
thousand
dead
and
wounded
the
living
ranks
sank
down
and
slept
beside
the
dead
lee
on
traveller
waited
by
the
highroad
until
late
night
man
by
man
his
generals
came
to
him
and

their
report
their
ghastly
report

the
potomac
if
general
mcclellan
wants
to
fight
in
the
morning
i
will

and
now
we
are
all
very
tired
the
sun
came
up
dim
behind
the
mist
the
mist
rose
the
morning
advanced
the
september
sunshine
lay
like
vital
warmth
upon
the
height
and
vale
upon
the
dunkard
church
and
the
wood
about
it
upon
the
cornfields
and
burnside
bridge
and
the
bloody
lane
and
upon
all
the
dead
men
in
the
cornfields
in
the
woods
upon
the
heights
beside
the
stream
in
the
lane
the
sunshine
lay
upon
the

as
the
prophet
upon
the
shunamite
child
but
it
could
not
reanimate
grey
and
blue
the
living

the
top
of
the
hill
past
dead
men
and
horses
and
much
wreckage
of
caissons

the
other
lifted
the
and
with
it
swept
the
antietam
and
the
fields
and
ridges
beyond
it
he
looked
at
the
federal
left
and
he
looked
at
the
federal
centre
and
he
looked
along
the
federal
right
which
was
opposite
then
he
lowered
the
glasses
general
they
have
a
very
strong
position
and
they
are
in
great
force
good
i
wish
you
to
take
fifty
pieces
of
artillery
and
crush
that
force
stephen
lee
was
a
brave
man
he
said
nothing
now
but
he
stood
a
moment
in
silence
and
then
he
took
his
and
looked
again
he
looked
now
at
the
many
and
formidable
federal
batteries
clustered
like
dark
fruit
above
the
antietam
and
now
at
the
masses
of
blue
infantry
and
now
at
the
positions
under
artillery
and
musketry
fire
which
the
confederate
batteries
must
take
he
put
the
glass
down
again
yes
general
where
shall
i
get
the
fifty
guns
how
many
have
you
i
had
thirty
some
were
lost
a
number
disabled
i
have
twelve
just
so
well
colonel
i
could
give
you
a
few
and
general
lee
tells
me
he
can
furnish
some
the
other
fingered
a
button
on
his
coat
for
a
moment
then
yes
general
shall
i
go
for
the
guns
no
not
yet
stonewall
jackson
laid
his
large
hands
in
their
worn
old
brown
gauntlets
one
over
the
other
upon
his
saddle
bow
he
too
looked
at
the
federal
right
and
the
guns
on
the
heights
like
dark
fruit
his
eyes
made
just
a
glint
of
blue
light
below
the
forage
cap
colonel
lee
can
you
crush
the
federal
right
with
fifty
guns
the
artillerist
drew
a
quick
breath
let
the
button
alone
and
raised
his
head
higher
i
can
try
general
i
can
do
it
if
any
one
can
that
is
not
what
i
asked
you
sir
if
i
give
you
fifty
guns
can
you
crush
the
federal
right
the
other
hesitated
general
i
do
know
what
you
want
of
me
is
it
my
technical
opinion
as
an
artillery
officer
or
do
you
want
to
know
if
i
will
make
the
attempt
if
you
give
me
the
order
of
course
i
will
make
it
yes
colonel
but
i
want
your
positive
opinion
yes
or
no
can
you
crush
the
federal
right
with
fifty
guns
the
artillerist
looked
again
steadying
arm
and
glass
against
a
charred
bough
general
it
can
not
be
done
with
fifty
guns
and
the
troops
you
have
here
hilltop
and
withered
wood
hung
a
moment
silent
in
the
air
sunny
but
yet
with
a
taste
of
all
the
powder
that
had
been
burned
then
said
jackson
good
let
us
ride
back
colonel
they
turned
their
horses
but
stephen
lee
with
some
emotion
began
to
put
the
case
you
forced
me
general
to
say
what
i
did
say
if
you
send
the
guns
i
beg
of
you
not
to
give
them
to
another
i
will
fight
them
to
the
last
extremity
he
looked
to
the
other
anxiously
to
say
to
stonewall
jackson
that
you
must
despair
and
die
where
he
sent
you
in
to
conquer
but
jackson
had
no
grimness
of
aspect
he
looked
quietly
thoughtful
it
was
even
with
a
smile
of
sweetness
that
he
cut
short
the
pleading
it
all
right
colonel
it
all
right
everyone
knows
that
you
are
a
brave
officer
and
would
fight
the
guns
well
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
he
checked
little
sorrel
we
part
here
colonel
you
go
at
once
to
general
lee
tell
him
all
that
has
happened
since
he
sent
you
to
me
tell
him
that
you
examined
the
federal
position
tell
him
that
i
forced
you
to
give
the
technical
opinion
of
an
artillery
officer
and
tell
him
what
that
opinion
is
that
is
all
colonel
the
september

wore
on

watched

go
onward
in
the
steady
chilling

there
motionless
as
a

those

made
no
further
effort
this
september
to
invade

the

waited
another
day
above

then
withdrew
a
few
miles
to
the
banks
of
the
opequon
the
opequon
a
clear
and
pleasing
stream
meandered
through
the
lower
reaches
of
the
great
valley
through
a
fertile
lovely
country
as
yet
not
greatly
scored
and
blackened
by
war
torch
and
harrow
an
easy
ride
to
the
westward
and
you
arrived
in
winchester
beloved
of
jackson
and
the
army
corps
as
the
autumn
advanced
the
banks
of
the
opequon
the
yet
thick
forests
that
stretched
toward
the
potomac
the
great
maples
and
oaks
and
gums
and
hickories
that
rose
singly
or
in
clusters
from
the
rolling
farm
lands
put
on
a
most
gorgeous
colouring
the
air
was
mellow
and
sunny
from
the
far
and
near
there
came
always
a
faint
pungent
smell
of
wood
smoke
curls
of
blue
vapour
rose
from
every
glade
the
land
seemed
bathed
in
indian
summer
through
it
in
the
mellow
sunlight
beneath
the
crimson
of
the
gums
the
lighter
red
of
the
maples
the
yellow
of
the
hickories
the
army
corps
found
itself
for
weeks
back
on
the
drill
ground
the
old
army
of
the
valley
crowed
and
clapped
on
the
back
the
light
division
and
hill

after
a
while
lord
it
used
to
be
hours
a
day
not
only
did
the
corps
drill
it
refitted
mysteriously
there
came
from
winchester
a
really
fair
amount
of
shoes
and
clothing
only
the
fewest
were
now
actually
barefoot
in
every
regiment
there
went
on
too
a
careful
cobbling
if
by
any
means
a
shoe
could
be
made
to
do
it
was
put
in
that
position
uniforms
were
patched
and
cleaned
and
every
day
was
washing
day
all
the
hillsides
were
spread
with
soldiers
shirts
the
red
leaves
drifting
down
on
them
looked
like
but
the
leaves
could
be
brushed
away
the
men
standing
in
the
opequon
whistled
as
they
rubbed
and
wrung
every
day
the
recovered
from
hospitals
and
the
footsore
stragglers
and
the
men
detached
or
furloughed
came
home
to
camp
there
came
in

who
last

october
drifted
on
smooth
as
the
opequon
red
and
yellow
leaves
drifted
down
wood
smoke
arose
sound
was
wrapped
as
in
fine
wool
dulled
everywhere
to
sweetness
whirring
insects
rippling
water
the
axe
the
whistling
soldiers
the
the
all
were
swept
into
a
smooth
current
steady
almost
droning
somewhat
the
corps
would
have
said
that
it
was
a
long
time
on
the
opequon
but
that
on
the
whole
it
found
the
place
a
pleasing
land
of
visitors
came
to
the
opequon
parties
from
winchester
officers
from
the
corps
commanded
by
longstreet
and
encamped
a
few
miles
to
the
eastward
officers
from
the
headquarters
of
the
general
lee
came
himself
on
traveller
and
with
stonewall
jackson
rode
along
the
opequon
under
the
scarlet
maples
one
day
there
appeared
a
cluster
of
englishmen
colonel
the
honourable
garnet
wolseley
the
special
correspondent
of
the
the
honourable
francis
lawley
and
the
special
correspondent
of
the
london
frank
vizetelly
general
lee
had
sent
them
over
under
the
convoy
of
an
officer
with
a
note
to
stonewall
jackson
my
dear
general
these
gentlemen
very
especially
wish
to
make
your
acquaintance
yours
lee
they
made
it
beneath
a
beautiful
tall
crimson
gum
tree
where
on
a
floor
of
fallen
leaves
jackson
tent
was
pitched
a
a
wooden
chair
and
two
boxes
were
placed
there
was
a
respectful
silence
while
the
opequon
murmured
by
then
garnet
wolseley
spoke
of
the
great
interest
which
england
virginia
mother
country
was
taking
in
this
struggle
yes
sir
said
jackson
it
would
be
natural
for
a
mother
to
take
an
even
greater
interest
and
the
admiration
general
with
which
we
have
watched
your
career
the
career
of
genius
if
i
may
say
so
by
jove
yes
sir
it
is
not
my
career
god
has
the
matter
in
hand
well
he
knows
how
to
pick
his
lieutenants
you
have
the
most
ideal
place
for
a
camp
general
but
i
suppose
before
these
coloured
leaves
all
fall
you
will
be
moving
it
is
an
open
secret
i
suppose
sir
said
the
correspondent
of
the
that
when
mcclellan
does
see
fit
to
cross
you
will
meet
him
east
of
the
blue
ridge
may
i
ask
sir
said
the
correspondent
of
the
what
you
think
of
this
latest
move
on
the
political
i
mean
lincoln
proclamation
of
emancipation
the
leaves
are
said
jackson
a
beautiful
colour
i
was
in
england
one
autumn
colonel
wolseley
but
i
did
not
observe
our
autumn
colours
in
your
foliage
climate
doubtless
but
what
was
my
admiration
were
your
cathedrals
yes
general
wonderful
are
they
not
music
in
stone
should
mcclellan
cross
would
the
fredericksburg
route
good
good
music
in
stone
which
of
your
great
church
structures
do
you
prefer
sir
why
sir
i
might
prefer
westminster
abbey
would
good
westminster
abbey
a
soldier
answer
i
remember
that
i
especially
liked
durham
i
liked
the
galilee
chapel
and
the
tomb
of
the
venerable
bede
cuthbert
is
buried
there
too
is
he
not
i
really
do
remember
sir
is
he
mr
lawley
i
believe
so
yes
he
is
you
have
got
any
cathedrals
here
general
jackson
but
you
got
about
the
most
interesting
army
on
the
globe
will
mcclellan
i
like
the
solidity
of
the
early
norman
the
foundations
were
laid
in
i
believe
very
probably
general
has
general
lee
it
has
a
commanding
situation
an
advantage
which
all
of
your
cathedrals
do
not
possess
i
liked
the
windows
best
at
york
what
do
you
think
colonel
i
think
that
you
are
right
general
when
your
wars
are
over
i
hope
that
you
will
visit
england
again
i
suppose
that
you
can
not
say
how
soon
that
will
be
sir
no
sir
only
god
can
say
that
i
should
like
to
see
ely
and
canterbury
he
rose
gentlemen
it
has
been
pleasant
to
meet
you
i
hear
the
adjutant
call
if
you
would
like
to
find
out
how
my
men
colonel
johnson
may
take
you
to
the
later
there
arrived
beneath
the
crimson
gum
four
of
jeb
officers
gallantly
mounted
and
equipped
young
and
fine
their
usual
careless
dash
was
tempered
by
something
of
important
gravity
if
their
eyes
danced
it
was
beneath
lids
they
did
not
smile
outright
but
their
lips
twitched
behind
them
an
orderly
bore
a
long
pasteboard
box
the
foremost
officer
was
major
heros
von
borcke
of
general
stuart
staff
all
dismounted
jackson
came
out
of
his
tent
the
air
was
golden
warm
the
earth
was
level
before
the
tent
and
on
the
carpet
of
small
bright
leaves
was
yet
the
table
the
chair
the
and
the
boxes
it
made
a
fine
room
of
audience
the
cavalry
saluted
jackson
touched
the
forage
cap
and
sat
down
the
staff
officer
simple
big
and
genuine
stood
forward
major
von
borcke
is
it
not
well
major
what
is
general
stuart
about
just
now
general
he
is
watching
his
old
schoolmate
general
mcclellan
my
general
i
come
on
a
graceful
errand
a
little
gift
from
general
stuart
bearing
he
has
so
great
an
esteem
and
friendship
for
you
general
he
asks
that
you
accept
so
slight
a
token
of
that
esteem
and
friendship
and
he
would
say
affection
and
he
does
say
reverence
he
says
that
from
richmond
he
has
for
this
sent
major
heros
von
borcke
made
a
signal
the
orderly
advanced
and
placed
upon
the
pine
table
the
box
the
other
cavalry
officers
stepped
a
little
nearer
two
or
three
of
stonewall
jackson
military
family
came
also
respectfully
closer
the
red
gum
leaves
made
a
rustling
underfoot
general
stuart
is
extremely
kind
said
jackson
i
have
a
high
esteem
for
jeb
stuart
you
will
tell
him
so
major
slowly
slowly
came
off
the
lid
slowly
slowly
came
away
a
layer
of
silver
paper
where
on
earth
they
got
in
richmond
in
the
gay
box
the
silver
paper
passes
comprehension
the
staff
thought
it
looked
parisian
and
nursed
the
idea
that
it
had
once
held
a
ball
gown
slowly
slowly
out
came
the
gift
a
startled
sound
immediately
suppressed
was
uttered
by
the
military
family
jackson
merely
looked
a
stone
wall
the
old
servant
jim
was
now
also
upon

the
review
this
afternoon
general
wo

he
did
at
first
the
men
did
not
know
him
then
there
mounted
a
wild
excitement
suppressed
with
difficulty
during
the
actual
evolutions
it
burst
into
flower
when
the
ranks
were
broken
the
sun
was
setting
in
a
flood
of
gold
there
hung
a
fairy
light
over
the
green
fields
and
the
opequon
and
the
vivid
woods
the
place
rang
to
the
frolic
shouting

in
a
rain
and
drift
of
leaves
into
a
russet
november
the
curls
of
wood
smoke
showed
plainer
down
the
glades
the
crows
were
cawing
the
migratory
birds
going
south
but
the
days
were
yet
mild
and
still
wrapped
in
a
balm
of
pale
sunshine
a
faint
purplish
indian
summer
haze
the
corps
was
hale
and
soberly
happy
it
was
the
chaplain
season
there
occurred
in
the
army
of
northern
virginia
a
religious
revival
a
and
lasting
deepening
of
feeling
for
many
nights
in
many
forest
glades
there
were
meetings
with
prayer
and
singing
old
hundred
floated
through
the
air
from
tents
and
huts
of
boughs
came
the
soldiers
they
sat
upon
the
earth
thick
carpeted
now
with
the
faded
leaves
or
upon
gnarled
roots
of
oak
and
beech
above
shone
the
moon
there
was
a
touch
of
frost
in
the
air
the
chaplain
had
some
improvised
pulpit
a
great
fire
or
perhaps
a
torch
fastened
to
a
bough
gave
light
whereby
to
read
the
book
the
sound
of
the
voice
the
sound
of
the
singing
blended
with
the
voice
of
the
opequon
rushing
all
rushing
toward
the
great
sea
come
humble
sinner
in
whose
breast
a
thousand
thoughts
revolve
it
made
a
low
thunder
so
many
soldiers
voices
always
on
these
nights
in
some
glade
or
meadow
with
some
regiment
or
other
there
was
found
the
commander
of
the
corps
beneath
the
cathedral
roof
of
the
forest
or
beneath
the
stars
in
the
open
sat
stonewall
jackson
worshipping
the
god
of
battles
undoubtedly
he
was
really
and
deeply
happy
his
place

hills
with
joab

laid
his
mailed
hand
upon
the

it
was
not
yet
the
straining
clutch
of
later
days
but
it
was
bad
enough
the
indian
summer
wrapped
with
a
soft
touch
of
mourning
purple
much
of
desolation
much
of
untilled
earth
and
charred
and
broken
walls
the
air
was
soft
and
gentle
lying
balmy
and
warm
on
the
road
and
ragged
fields
and
the
haze
so
hid
the
distances
that
the
column
thought
not
so
much
of
how
the
land
was
scarred
as
of
the

that
thronged

riding

be
supposed
to

his

rode

standing
with

on

he
watched
for
a
while
his
thousands
passing
stuart
gay
present
had
taken
the

but
once
here
was
the
old
familiar
array
leaf
brown
from

and
dust
and

patched

patched
there
dull
of

the

passed

shouted
for

nodded
and

a

close

judith
judith

us
do
something
judith
looked
at
her
with
a
twisted
smile
this
morning
very
early
we
went
with
aunt
lucy
over
the
storeroom
and
the
and
then
we
went
down
to
the
quarter
and
got
them
all
together
and
told
them
how
careful
now
we
would
all
have
to
be
with
meal
and
bacon
and
baby
had
died
in
the
night
and
we
had
to
comfort
susan
and
this
afternoon
we
buried
the
baby
after
breakfast
we
scraped
almost
the
last
of
the
tablecloths
into
lint
and
molly
made
envelopes
and
daddy
ben
and
i
talked
about
shoes
and
how
we
could
make
them
at
home
then
aunt
lucy
and
i
went
into
town
to
the
hospitals
there
is
a
rumour
of
smallpox
but
i
am
sure
it
is
only
a
rumour
it
has
been
a
hard
day
a
number
of
sick
were
brought
in
from
fredericksburg
so
much
pneumonia
an
old
man
and
woman
came
up
from
north
carolina
looking
for
their
son
i
took
them
through
the
wards
oh
it
was
pitiful
no
he
was
not
there
probably
he
was
killed
and
unity
went
to
the
and
has
been
there
sewing
hard
all
day
and
then
we
came
home
and
found
julius
almost
in
tears
and
molly
triumphant
with
the
parlour
carpet
all
up
and
ready
to
be
cut
into
squares
soldiers
sleeping
in
the
snowy
winter
under
tulips
and
roses
and
then
we
read
father
letter
and
that
was
a
comfort
a
comfort
and
then
we
took
susan
little
baby
and
buried
it
and
did
what
we
could
for
susan
and
then
we
walked
down
to
the
gate
and
stopped
to
gather
chrysanthemums
and
now

drifting
down

was
what
they
thought
of

miss
lucy
having
read
the
paper
through
the
greenwood
ladies
went
to
supper
that
frugal
meal
over
they
came
back
to
the
library
the
parlour
looking
somewhat
desolate
with
the
carpet
up
and
rolled
in
one
corner
waiting
for
the
shears
the
shepherds
and
shepherdesses
look
said
unity
as
though
they
were
shivering
a
little
i
do
suppose
they
ever
thought
they
live
to
see
a
wilton
carpet
cut
into
blankets
for
carys
and
other
soldiers
gone
to
war
impossible
not
to
laugh
when
you
think
of
edward
drawing
one
of
those
coverlets
over
him
oh
me
if
edward
gets
a
furlough
this
winter
said
judith
suddenly
we
must
give
him
a
party
with
the
two
companies
in
town
and
some
of
the
surgeons
there
will
be
men
enough
then
virginia
and
nancy
and
deb
and
maria
and
betty
and
agatha
and
all
the
refugeeing
girls
we
could
have
a
real
party
once
more
just
leaving
out
the
things
to
eat
said
unity
and
wearing
very
old
clothes
we
do
it
wo
we
aunt
lucy
aunt
lucy
thought
it
an
excellent
idea
we
must
get
old
before
our
time
we
must
keep
brightness
about
the
place
i
have
seen
my
mother
laugh
and
look
all
the
gayer
out
of
her
beautiful
black
eyes
when
other
folk
would
have
been
weeping
i
hear
company
coming
now
it
cousin
william
i
think
cousin
william
it
was
not
gone
to
the
war
because
of
years
and
a
rich
inheritance
of
gout
he
came
in
ruddy
as
an
apple
ridden
over
to
cheer
up
the
greenwood
folk
and
hear
and
tell
news
from
the
front
he
had
sons
there
himself
and
a
letter
which
he
would
read
for
the
thirtieth
time
when
judith
had
made
him
take
the
great
armchair
and
miss
lucy
had
rung
for
julius
and
a
glass
of
wine
and
unity
had
trimmed
the
light
and
molly
replenished
the
fire
he
read
and
as
in
these
days
no
one
ever
read
anything
perfunctorily
the
reading
was
more
telling
than
an
actor
could
have
made
it
in
places
cousin
william
himself
and
his
hearers
laughed
and
in
places
reader
and
listener
brushed
hand
across
eyes
your
loving
son
he
read
and
folded
the
sheets
carefully
for
they
were
becoming
a
little
worn
now
your
news
lucy
have
you
heard
from
fauquier
yes
yesterday
he
has
reached
fredericksburg
from
winchester
it
is
one
of
his
old
dry
charming
letters
only
only
a
little
hard
to
make
out
in
places
because
he
not
yet
used
to
writing
with
his
left
hand
miss
lucy
face
worked
for
a
moment
then
she
smiled
again
with
a
certain
high
courage
and
sweetness
and
taking
the
letter
from
her
read
it
to
cousin
william
he
listened
nodding
his
head
at
intervals
yes
yes
to
be
sure
to
be
sure
you
ca
remember
uncle
edward
churchill
lucy
but
i
can
he
used
to
read
swift
to
me
though
i
did
care
for
it
much
except
for
gulliver
fauquier
reminds
me
of
him
often
except
that
uncle
edward
was
bitter
though
it
was
because
of
his
empty
sleeve
it
was
for
other
fredericksburg
there
be
another
terrible
battle
and
warwick
we
heard
from
him
a
short
letter
hurriedly
written
but
oh
like
warwick
like
warwick
she
read
this
too
it
was
followed
by
a
silence
in
the
old
greenwood
library
then
said
cousin
william
softly
it
is
worth
while
to
get
such
letters
there
are
many
like
warwick
cary
he
the
kind
that
proves
the
future
shows
it
is
just
a
noble
dream
and
edward
a
letter
three
days
ago
just
after
you
were
here
the
last
time
the
room
smiled
it
was
what
edward
calls
a
screed
said
molly
there
was
a
thing
about
war
in
it
unity
stirred
the
fire
making
the
sparks
go
up
chimney
five
pages
about
massanutton
in
her
autumn
robes
and
a
sonnet
to
the
shenandoah
i
like
edward
at
ten
cousin
william
rode
away
the
greenwood
women
had
prayers
and
then
linked
together
they
went
up
the
broad
old
shallow
stairs
to
the
gallery
above
and
kissed
one
another
in
her
own
room
judith
laid
pine
knots
upon
the
brands
up
flared
the
light
and
reddened
all
the
pleasant
chamber
she
unclad
herself
slipped
on
her
brushed
and
braided
her
dusky
hair
rippling
long
and
thick
then
fed
again
the
fire
took
letters
from
her
rosewood
box
and
in
the
light
from
the
hearth
read
them
for
the
thousandth
time
there
was
none
from
richard
cleave
after
july
none
none
sitting
in
a
low
chair
that
had
been
her
mother
she
bowed
herself
over
the
letters
over
the
letters
there
had
been
but
two
months
of
bliss
two
months
she
read
them
again
although
she
had
them
all
by
heart
she
held
her
hand
as
though
it
held
a
pen
and
traced
the
words
so
that
she
might
feel
here
and
so
his
hand
rested
she
put
the
paper
to
her
cheek
against
her
lips
she
slipped
to
her
knees
laid
her
arms
along
the
seat
of
the
chair
and
her
head
upon
them
and
prayed
o
god
my
lover
hast
thou
put
far
from
o
god
my
lover
hast
thou
put
far
from
me
she
knelt
there
long
but
at
last
she
rose
laid
the
letters
in
the
box
and
took
from
another
compartment
margaret
cleave
these
were
since
july
a
letter
every
fortnight
judith
read
again
the
later
ones
the
ones
of
the
late
summer
dear
child
dearest
child
i
can
not
tell
you
only
be
forever
sure
that
wherever
he
is
at
three
oaks
or
elsewhere
he
loves
you
loves
you
no
i
do
not
know
that
his
is
the
course
that
i
should
take
but
then
women
are
different
i
do
not
think
i
would
ever
think
of
pride
or
of
the
world
and
the
world
opinion
if
you
cried
to
me
i
would
go
and
the
world
should
not
hold
me
back
but
men
have
been
trained
to
uphold
that
kind
of
pride
i
did
not
think
that
richard
had
it
but
i
see
now
all
his
father
in
him
darling
child
i
do
not
think
that
it
will
last
but
just
now
oh
just
now
you
must
possess
your
heart
in
patience
the
words
blurred
before
judith
eyes
she
sunk
her
head
upon
her
knees
possess
my
heart
in
patience
possess
my
heart
in
patience
oh
god
i
am
not
old
enough
yet
to
do
it
she
read
another
letter
one
of
later
date
judith
i
promised
i
can
not
tell
you
but
he
is
well
oh
believe
that
and
believe
too
that
he
is
doing
his
work
he
is
not
the
kind
to
rest
from
work
he
must
work
and
slowly
slowly
that
brings
salvation
you
are
a
noble
woman
be
noble
still
and
wait
awhile
and
wait
awhile
it
come
right
miriam
is
better
the
woods
about
three
oaks
are
gorgeous
she
read
another
child
he
is
not
at
three
oaks
now
you
must
rest
rest
and
wait
judith
put
the
letters
in
the
rosewood
box
she
arose
locked
her
hands
behind
her
head
and
walked
softly
up
and
down
the
room
rest
rest
and
wait
patience
quietude
tranquillity
strength
fortitude
endurance
rest
patience
calm
quietude
it
worked
but
partially
presently
when
she
lay
down
it
was
to
lie
still
enough
but
sleepless
late
in
the
night
she
slept
but
it
was
to
dream
again
much
as
she
had
dreamed
during
the
seven
days
great
and
tragic
visions
dawn
waked
her
she
lay
staring
at
the
white
ceiling
then
she
arose
it
was
not
cold
the
earth
lay
still
at
this
season
yet
wrapped
and
warmed
and
softened
with
the
memories
of
summer
judith
looked
out
of
the
window
there
was
a
glow
in
the
eastern
sky
the
trees
were
motionless
the
brown
path
over
the
hills
showed
like
a
beckoning
finger
she
dressed
put
a
cloak
about
her
went
softly
downstairs
and
left
the
house
the
path
across
the
meadow
through
the
wood
up
the
lone
tree
hill
she
would
see
the
sunrise
she
would
get
above
the
world
she
walked
quickly
lightly
through
the
dank
stillness
there
was
mist
in
the
meadow
above
the
little
stream
the
wood
was
shadowy
mist
like
ghosts
between
the
trees
she
passed
through
it
and
came
out
on
the
bare
hillside
rising
to
the
one
tree
with
the
bench
around
it
the
eastern
sky
was
burning
gold
judith
stood
still
there
was
a
man
seated
upon
the
bench
on
the
side
that
overlooked
greenwood
he
sat
with
his
head
buried
in
his
hands
she
could
not
yet
tell
but
she
thought
he
was
in
uniform
with
the
thought
she
moved
onward
she
never
remembered
afterwards
whether
she
recognized
him
then
or
whether
she
thought
a
soldier
sleeping
through
the
night
up
here
why
did
he
not
come
to
the
house
she
made
no
noise
on
the
bare
moist
earth
of
the
path
she
was
within
thirty
feet
of
the
bench
when
cleave
lifted
his
head
from
his
hands
rose
stood
still
a
moment
then
with
a
gesture
weary
and
determined
turned
to
descend
the
hill
on
the
side
away
from
greenwood
toward
a
road
she
called
to
him
richard
it
was
rapture
all
beneath
the
rising
sun
forgotten
save
only
this
hilltop
with
its
tree
from
eden
garden
but
since
it
was
earth
and
paradise
not
yet
real
and
there
were
checks
and
bars
enough
in
their
human
lot
they
came
back
from
that
seraph
flight
this
was
the
lone
tree
hill
above
greenwood
and
a
november
day
though
and
philip
deaderick
must
get
back
to
the
section
of
pelham
artillery
refitting
at
what
do
you
mean
you
are
a
soldier
you
are
back
in
the
army
but
you
have
another
name
oh
richard
i
see
i
see
oh
i
might
have
known
a
gunner
with
pelham
oh
my
gunner
with
pelham
why
did
you
not
come
before
cleave
wrung
her
hands
clasped
in
his
then
bent
and
kissed
them
judith
i
will
speak
to
you
as
to
a
comrade
because
you
would
be
the
truest
comrade
ever
man
had
what
would
you
do
what
would
you
have
done
in
my
place
what
would
you
do
now
in
my
place
but
say
but
say
love
you
let
me
go
i
said
judith
what
would
i
have
done
i
would
have
reentered
the
army
as
you
have
reentered
it
i
would
serve
again
as
you
are
serving
again
if
it
were
necessary
oh
i
see
that
it
was
necessary
i
would
serve
disguised
as
you
are
disguised
but
but
when
it
came
to
judith
cary
judith
say
that
it
was
not
you
and
i
but
some
other
disgraced
soldier
and
one
of
your
sisters
you
are
not
a
disgraced
soldier
the
innocent
can
not
be
disgraced
who
knows
that
i
was
innocent
my
mother
and
you
judith
know
it
my
kinspeople
and
certain
friends
believe
it
but
all
the
rest
of
the
country
the
army
the
people
they
do
believe
it
let
my
name
be
known
and
by
evening
a
rougher
dismissal
than
before
do
you
not
see
do
you
not
see
judith
i
see
partly
i
see
that
you
must
serve
i
see
that
you
walk
with
dangers
i
see
that
that
you
could
not
even
write
i
see
that
i
must
possess
my
soul
in
patience
i
see
that
we
must
wait
oh
god
it
is
all
waiting
waiting
waiting
but
i
do
not
see
and
i
to
see
richard
anything
at
the
end
of
it
all
but
love
happiness
union
home
for
you
and
me
he
held
her
close
judith
i
do
not
know
the
right
i
am
not
sure
that
i
see
the
right
my
soul
is
so
that
day
at
white
oak
swamp
if
i
could
cleanse
that
day
bring
it
again
into
line
with
the
other
days
of
my
life
poor
and
halting
though
they
may
have
been
though
they
may
be
if
i
could
make
all
men
say
life
was
a
whole
one
life
not
two
he
had
no
twin
a
disobedient
soldier
a
liar
and
betrayer
as
it
was
said
he
had
if
i
could
do
that
judith
i
do
not
see
how
i
will
do
it
and
yet
it
is
my
intention
to
do
it
that
done
then
darling
darling
i
will
make
true
love
to
you
if
it
is
not
done
but
i
will
not
think
of
that
only
only
how
to
do
it
how
to
do
it
that
maddens
me
at
times
is
it
that
then
we
must
think
of
that
they
are
not
all
dead
who
could
tell
maury
stafford
is
not
dead
maury
stafford
what
has
he
to
do
with
it
cleave
laughed
a
sound
sufficiently
grim
what
has
he
not
to
do
with
it
with
that
order
which
he
carried
from
general
jackson
to
general
winder
and
from
general
winder
not
before
god
to
me
winder
is
dead
and
the
courier
who
could
have
told
is
dead
and
others
whom
i
might
have
called
are
dead
dead
i
will
avow
because
of
my
choice
of
action
though
still
given
that
false
order
i
justify
that
choice
and
now
we
hear
that
major
stafford
was
among
those
taken
prisoner
at
sharpsburg
judith
stood
upright
her
hand
at
her
breast
her
eyes
narrowed
until
this
hour
i
never
knew
the
name
of
that
officer
i
never
thought
to
ask
i
never
thought
of
the
mistake
lying
there
the
mistake
all
these
months
i
have
thought
of
it
as
a
mistake
as
one
of
those
misunderstandings
mishappenings
accidental
incomprehensible
that
wound
and
blister
human
life
i
never
saw
it
in
a
lightning
flash
for
what
it
was
till
now
she
looked
about
her
still
with
an
intent
and
narrowed
gaze
the
lone
tree
hill
it
is
a
good
place
to
see
it
from
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
join
this
day
to
a
day
last
june
the
day
of
port
republic
raising
her
hands
she
pressed
them
to
her
eyes
as
though
to
shut
out
a
veritable
lightning
glare
then
dropped
them
she
stood
very
straight
young
slender
finely
and
strongly
fibred
he
said
he
would
do
the
worst
he
could
and
he
has
done
it
and
i
said
your
peril
and
at
his
peril
it
shall
be
and
the
harm
that
he
has
done
he
shall
undo
it
she
turned
richard
he
shall
undo
it
cleave
stood
beside
her
love
love
how
beautiful
the
light
is
over
greenwood
i
thought
sitting
here
will
not
wait
for
the
sunshine
i
will
go
while
all
things
are
in
shadow
and
i
turned
to
go
and
then
came
the
sunshine
i
must
go
now
away
from
the
sunshine
i
had
but
an
hour
and
half
of
it
was
gone
before
the
sunshine
came
how
shall
i
know
she
said

snow
lay
deep
on
the

in

up

down

on

about
the
little
city
on

bold

of
the
northern

on

of

the

with

twenty
thousand

appointed
this
day
to
pass
the
rappahannock
a

that
flowed
across
the

to
richmond
he
had
been
responsible
for
choosing
this
route
to
the
keep
of

he
must
make

his
reiterated
genial
assurances
of
success

there
the

say
so

may
be

well
we
crush
longstreet
we
build
our
bridges
under

of
this
fortunate
fog
and
go
over
and
defeat
longstreet
and
be

powerfully
made

old
barksdale
knew

they
opened

on

were
somewhat
sheltered
by

the

had
the

with
which
to

it
did
not

the

had
keen

were
gallant

beaten
back
from

they
came
again
and
again
but
again
and
again
the
eyes
of
the
swamp
hunters
ran
along
the
gleaming
barrels
and
a
thousand
bronzed
fingers
pulled
a
thousand
triggers
past
the
middle
of
the
day
the
fog
lifted
the
town
lay
defined
and
helpless
beneath
a
pallid
sky
the
artillery
of
the

of
the
potomac
opened
upon
it
one
hundred
and
forty
heavy
guns
set
in
tiers
upon

to
the
north
fired
each
into
fredericksburg
fifty
rounds
under
that
terrible
cover
the
blue
began
to
cross
on
pontoons
a
number
of
the
women
and
children
had
been
sent
from
the
town
during
the
preceding
days
not
all
however
were
gone
many
had
no
place
to
go
to
some
were
ill
and
some
were
nursing
the
ill
many
had
husbands
sons
brothers
there
at
hand
in
the
army
of
northern
virginia
and
would
not
go
now
with
the
beginning
of
the
bombardment
they
must
go
there
were
grey
imperative
orders
at
once
at
once
go
god
knows
but
go
they
went
almost
all
in
the
snow
beneath
the
pallid
sky
with
the
shells
shrieking
behind
them
they
carried
the
children
they
half
carried
the
sick
and
the
very
old
they
stumbled
on
between
the
frozen
hills
by
the
dark
pointed
cedars
over
the
bare
white
fields
behind
them
home
was
being
destroyed
before
them
lay
desolation
and
all
around
was
winter
they
had
perhaps
thought
it
out
and
were
headed
the
various
forlorn
lines
for
this
or
that
country
house
but
they
looked
lost
remnant
of
a
world
become
glacial
whirled
with
suddenness
into
the
sidereal
cold
cold
and
the
loneliness
of
cold
the
older
children
were
very
brave
but
there
were
babes
too
and
these
wailed
and
wailed
their
wailing
made
a
strange
futile
sound
beneath
the
thundering
of
the
guns
one
of
these
parties
came
through
the
snow
to
a
swollen
creek
on
which
the
ice
cakes
were
floating
cross
yes
but
how
the
leaders
consulted
together
then
went
up
the
stream
to
find
a
possible
ford
and
came
in
sight
of
a
grey
battery
waiting
among
the
hills
oh
soldiers
oh
soldiers
come
and
help
down
hastened
a
detachment
eager
respectful
a
lieutenant
directing
the
very
battery
horses
looking
anxious
responsible
a
soldier
in
the
saddle
a
child
in
front
a
child
behind
the
old
steady
horses
planting
their
feet
carefully
in
the
icy
rushing
stream
over
went
the
children
then
the
women
crossed
their
hands
resting
on
the
shoulders
all
were
over
all
thanked
the
soldiers
the
soldiers
took
off
their
caps
wished
with
all
their
hearts
that
they
had
at
command
palaces
and
a
banquet
set
having
neither
being
themselves
without
shelter
or
food
and
ordered
not
to
build
fires
they
could
only
bare
their
heads
and
watch
the
other
soldiers
out
of
sight
carrying
the
children
half
carrying
the
old
and
sick
stumbling
through
the
snow
by
the
dark
pointed
cedars
and
presently
lost
to
view
among
the
frozen
hills
the
shells
rained
destruction
into
fredericksburg
houses
were
battered
and
broken
houses
were
set
on
fire
through
the
smoke
and
uproar
the
explosions
and
detonations
and
tongues
of
flame
the
mississippians
beat
back
another
attempt
at
the
bridges
and
opened
fire
on
boat
after
boat
now
pushing
from
the
northern
shore
but
the
boats
came
bravely
on
bravely
manned
hundreds
might
be
driven
from
the
but
other
hundreds
sprang
to
take
their
places
and
always
from
the
heights
came
the
rain
of
iron
smashing
shivering
setting

tearing
up
the

the
shortest
of

before

up
from

in

upgathered
with

by

great

martial
picture

in
a
moment
of
vastness

epic
sublime
the

afire
smoke

went
up

a
sky
not

wholly
azure
banded
and
barred
with
clouds
from
behind
which
the
light
came
in
rays
fierce
and
bright
with
an
effect
of
threatening
there
was
a
ruined
house
on
a
high
hill
it
gave
the
appearance
of
a
grating
in

a
small
dungeon
grating
beyond
the
burning
town
was
the
river
crossed
now
by
six

there
were
troops
one
of

caught
the
bayonets
from

to

north
rose
the
heights
and
they
had
an
iron
crown
from
which
already
came
lightnings
and
thunders
there
were
paths
leading
down
to
the
river
and
these
showed
blue
moving
streams
bright
points
which
were
flags
moving
with
them
that
for
the
far
side
of
the
rappahannock
but
on
this
side
over
the
plain
that
stretched
south
and
west
of
the
town
there
moved
a
blue
sea
indeed
eighty
thousand
men
were
on
that
plain
they
moved
here
they
moved
there
into
battle
formation
and
they
moved
to
the
crash
of
music
to
the
horn
and
to
the
drum
the
long
rays
that
the
sun
was
sending
made
a
dazzle
of
bayonet

thousands
and
thousands
and
thousands
of

the
gleaming

deepening
the

his

crossed
the

to
the

was
a
tiny

beyond

a
ragged
bank
topped
by
brushwood
suddenly
from

opened
two
of

beneath

fire
the

brought
up
four

and

all
these
came
fiercely
into
action
when
they
got
his
range
pelham
moved
his
two
guns
and
began
again
a
raking
fire
again
the
blue
gunners
found
the
range
and
again
he
moved
with
deliberate
swiftness
and
again
he
opened
with
a
hot
and
raking
fire
one
gun
was
disabled
he
fought
with
the
other
he
fought
until
the
limber
chests
were
empty
and
there
came
an
imperious
message
from
jeb

get
back
from
destruction
you
infernal
gallant
fool

an
hour
the
heavily
timbered

except
for
the
crack
and
crash
of
severed
boughs
the

gave
no
sign
at
the
end
of
this
period
meade
resumed
his
advance
on
came
the
blue
lines
staunch
determined
troops
seasoned
now
as
the
grey
were
seasoned
they
meant
to
take
that
empty
line
of
hills
a
few
confederate
guns
that
done
they
would
be
in
a
position
to
flank
longstreet
already
attacked
in

by
grand

on
they
came
with
a
martial
front
steady
swinging
uninterrupted
they
marched
to
within
a
few
hundred
yards
of
prospect
hill
suddenly
the
woods
that
loomed
before
them
so
dark
and
quiet
blazed
and
rang
fifty
guns
were
within
that
cover
and
the
fifty
cast
their
thunderbolts
full
against
the
dark
blue
line
from
either
side
the
grey
artillery
burst
the

musketry
and
above
the
crackling
thunder
rose
the

meade
pennsylvanians
were
gallant
fighters
but
they
broke
beneath
that
withering

they
fell
back
in
strong
disorder
grey

north
and
south
there
were
gathered
upon
and
above
the
field
of
fredericksburg
four
hundred
guns
all
came
into
action
where
earlier
there
had
been
fog
over
the
plain
fog
wreathing
the
hillsides
there
was
now
smoke
dark
and
rolling
it
invaded
the
ruined
town
it
mantled
the
flowing
rappahannock
it
surmounted
the
hills
red
flashes
pierced
it
and
over
and
under
and
through
roared
the
enormous
sound
there
came
reinforcements
to
meade
division
after
division
in
the
meantime
sumner
was
hurling
brigades
against

and
longstreet
was
hurling
them
back

the

listened
to
the

from

giving

a

you

we
ought
to
have
occupied
that
tongue
of

so
in
sooth
thought
others
presently
it
was
a
marshy
dense
and
tangled
coppice
projecting
like
a
sabre
tooth
between
the
brigades
of
lane
and
archer
so
thick
was
the
growth
so
boggy
the
earth
that
at
the
last
it
had
been
pronounced
impenetrable
and
left
unrazed
now
the
mistake
was
paid
for
in
bloody
coin
meade

rushed
across
the
open
brushed
the
edge
of
the
coppice
discovered
that
it
was
empty
and
plunging
in
found
cover
the
grey
batteries
could
not
reach
them
almost
before
the
situation
was
realized
forth
burst
the
blue
from
the
thicket
lane
was
flanked
in
uproar
and
confusion
the
grey
gave
way
meade
sent
in
another
brigade
it
left
the
first
to
lane
hurled
itself
on
and
at
the
outskirt
of
the
wood
struck
archer
left
taking
archer
by
surprise
and
creating
a
a
third
brigade
entered
on
the
path
of
the
first
and
second
the
latter
leaving
archer
to
this
new
strength
hurled
itself
across
the
military
road
and
upon
a
thick
and
tall
wood
held
by
maxey
gregg
and
his
south
carolinians
smoke
cloud
and
forest
growth
it
was
hard
to
distinguish
colours
hard
to
tell
just
what
was
happening
gregg
thought
that
the
line
was
archer
falling
back
he
withheld
his
fire
the
line
came
on
and
in
a
moment
amid
shouts
struck
his
right
a
bullet
brought
down
gregg
himself
mortally
wounded
his
troops
broke
then
rallied
a

the

very
gallantly
receded

them
as

the

at

there
was

in

late
afternoon

were

much
of

boys
said

you
stand
killing
better
than
any
i
ever
saw
they
stood
it
well
both
blue
and
grey
it
was
stern
fighting
at
fredericksburg
and
grey
and
blue
they
fought
it
sternly
and
well
the
afternoon
closed
in
cold
and
still
with
a
red
sun
yet
veiled
by
drifts
of
smoke
the
army
of
the
potomac
torn
decimated
rested
huddled
in
fredericksburg
and
on
the
river
banks
the
army
of
northern
virginia
rested
with
few
or
no
on
the
southern
hills
between
the
two
foes
stretched
the
freezing
plain
and
on
the
plain
lay
thick
the
federal
dead
and
wounded
they
lay
thick
thick
before
the
stone
wall
at
hand
full
target
for
the
fire
of
either
force
was
a
small
white
house
in
the
house
lived
martha
stevens
she
would
not
leave
before
the
battle
though
warned
and
warned
again
to
do
so
she
said
she
had
an
idea
that
she
could
help
she
stayed
and
wounded
men
dragged
themselves
or
were
dragged
upon

little
porch

within
her
doors

ghastly
wounded
past

the

bullets
imbedded
themselves
in
its

to

fro
went
martha
stevens
doing
what
she
could
bandaging
hurts
till
the
bandages
gave
out
she
tore
into
strips
what
cloth
there
was
in
the
little
meagre
house
her
sheets
her
towels
her
tablecloths
her
poor
wardrobe
when
all
was
gone
she
tore
her
calico
dress
when
she
saw
from
the
open
door
a
man
who
could
not
drag
himself
that
far
she
went
and
helped
him
with
as
little
reck
as
may
be
conceived
of
shell
or
minie
the
sun
sank
a
red
ball
staining
the
snow
with
red
the
dark
came
rapidly
a
very
cold
dark
night
with
myriads
of
stars
the
smoke
slowly
cleared
the
great
opposed
forces
lay
on
their
arms
the
one
closely
drawn
by
the
river
the
other
on
the
southern
hills
between
was
the
plain
and
the
plain
was
a
place
of
drear
sound
oh
of
drear
sound
neither
army
showed
any
lights
for
all
its
antagonist
knew
either
might
be
feverishly
in
the
darkness
preparing
an
attack
grey
and
blue
the
guns
yet
dominated
that
wide
and
mournful
level
over
which
to
leap
upon
the
other
either
foe
must
pass
grey
and
blue
there
was
little
sleeping
it
was
too
cold
and
there
was
need
for
watchfulness
and
the
plain
was
too
unhappy
the
plain
was
too
unhappy
the
smoke
vanished
slowly
from
the
air
the
night
lay
sublimely
still
fearfully
clear
and
cold
about
ten
nature
provided
a
spectacle
the
grey
troops
huddled
upon
the
hillsides
drew
a
quickened
breath
a
florida
regiment
showed
alarm
what
that
look
at
that
light
in
the
sky
great
shafts
of
light
streaming
up
look
opening
like
a
fan
what
that
chaplain
what
that
do
reckon
the
lord
tired
of
fighting
and
it
the
judgment
day
no
no
boys
it
an
aurora
borealis
say
it
over
please
oh
northern
lights
well
we
heard
of
them
before
but
we
never
saw
them
having
a
lot
of
experiences
here
in
virginia
well
it
beautiful
any
way
and
i
think
it
terrible
i
wish
those
northern
lights
would
do
something
for
the
northern
wounded
down
there
nothing
else
that
northern
seems
likely
to
do
it
look
at
them
look
at
them
pale
red
and
dancing
i
heard
them
called
merry
dancers
there
a
shooting
star
they
say
that
every
time
a
star
shoots
some
one
dies
that
not
so
if
it
were
the
whole
sky
would
be
full
of
falling
stars
look
at
that
red
ray
going
up
to
the
zenith
o
god
make
the
plain
stop
groaning
the
display
in
the
heavens
continued
luminous
rays
faintly
shifting
from
east
to
west
streaming
upward
until
they
were
lost
in
the
starry
vault
elsewhere
the
sky
was
dark
intensely
clear
the
winter
stars
like
diamonds
there
was
no
wind
the
wide
unsheltered
plain
across
which
had
stormed
across
which
had
receded
the
federal
charges
was
sown
thick
with
soldiers
who
had
dropped
from
the
ranks
many
and
many
lay
still
dead
and
cold
their
marchings
and
their
tentings
and
their
battles
over
they
had
fought
well
they
had
died
they
lay
here
now
stark
and
pale
but
in
the
vast
pictured
web
of
the
whole
their
threads
are
strong
and
their
colour
holds
but
on
the
plain
of
fredericksburg
many
and
many
and
many
were
not
dead
and
resting
hundreds
and
hundreds
they
lay
and
could
not
rest
for
mortal
anguish
they
writhed
and
tossed
they
dragged
themselves
a
little
way
and
fell
again
they
idly
waved
a
hat
or
sword
or
empty
hand
for
help
they
cried
for
aid
they
cried
for
water
those
who
could
not
lift
their
voices
moaned
moaned
some
had
grown
delirious
and
upon
that
plain
there
was
even
laughter
all
the
various
notes
taken
together
blended
into
one
long
dreary
weird
dull
and
awful
sound
steady
as
a
wind
in
miles
of
frozen
reeds
they
were
all
blue
soldiers
and
they
lay
where
they
fell
there
was
a
long
fringe
of
them
near
the
stone
wall
and
near
the
railway
embankment
behind
which
now
rested
the
light
division
and
taliaferro
and
early
the
wind
here
was
loud
rattling
a
thicker
growth
of
reeds
above
the
long
silent
flickering
lights
mocked
with
their
rosy
hue
and
the
glittering
stars
mocked
and
the
empty
concave
of
the
night
mocked
and
the
sound
of
the
rappahannock
mocked
a
river
moving
by
like
the
river
of
death
and
they
could
not
even
get
to
the
river
to
drink
drink
drink
a
figure
kneeling
by
a
wounded
man
spoke
in
a
guarded
voice
to
an
upright
approaching
form
this
man
could
be
saved
i
have
given
him
water
i
went
myself
to
the
general
and
he
said
that
if
we
could
get
any
into
the
hospital
behind
the
hill
we
might
do
so
but
i
not
strong
enough
to
lift
him
i
air
said
billy
he
set
down
the
bucket
that
he
carried
i
jest
filled
it
from
the
creek
it
do
last
any
time
they
air
so
thirsty
you
take
it
and
i
take
him
he
put
his
arms
under
the
blue
figure
lifted
it
like
a
child
and
moved
away
noiseless
in
the
darkness
corbin
wood
took
the
bucket
and
dipper
presently
it
must
be
refilled
by
the
creek
he
met
an
officer
sent
down
from
the
hillside
you
twenty
men
out
there
have
got
to
be
very
careful
if
their
sentries
see
or
hear
you
moving
you

with
the
whole
of
us
behind
and
every

will
be

your
pardon

all
be
very
quiet
old
jack
would
say
that
mercy
all
right

you
must
alarm

jackson
rode
by

with
a
face
that

a

a

watched
him

stood
and
faced
each

there
was
sharpshooting
there
was

alive
upon
that
plain
the

in

died
to
a
ghostly

there
came
up
a
terrible

to
come

tell
me
what
that

tell

chapter
xlvii
the
wilderness
fifteen
by
twenty
miles
stretched
the
wilderness
out
of
a
thin
soil
grew
pine
trees
and
pine
trees
scrub
oak
and
scrub
oak
the
growth
was
of
the
densest
mile
after
mile
of
dense
growth
a
few
slight
farms
and
clearings
appeared
like
islands
all
around
them
was
the
sea
the
sea
of
tree
and
bush
it
stretched
here
it
stretched
there
it
touched
all
horizons
vanishing
beyond
them
in
an
amethyst
haze
several
forest
tracks
traversed
it
but
they
were
narrow
and
worn
and
it
was
hard
to
guess
their
presence
or
to
find
it
when
guessed
there
were
however
two
fair
roads
the
old
turnpike
and
the
plank
road
these
also
were
sunken
in
the
thick
thick
growth
a
traveller
upon
them
saw
little
save
the
fact
that
he
had
entered
the
wilderness
near
the
turnpike
stood
a
small
white
church
the
tabernacle
church
a
little
south
of
the
heart
of
the
place
lay
an
old
old
abandoned
iron
furnace
catherine
furnace
as
much
to
the
north
rose
a
large
old
house
chancellorsville
to
the
westward
was
dowdall
tavern
around
all
swept
the
pine
and
the
scrub
oak
just
varied
by
other
trees
and
blossoming
shrubs
the
ground
was
level
or
only
slightly
rolling
look
where
one
might
there
was
tree
and
bush
tree
and
bush
a
sense
of
illimitable
woodland
of
far
horizons
of
a
not
unhappy
sameness
of
stillness
of
beauty
far
removed
from
picturesqueness
of
vague
diffused
charm
of
silence
of
sadness
not
too
sad
of
mystery
not
too
baffling
of
sunshine
very
still
and
golden
a
man
knew
he
was
in
the
wilderness
mayday
here
was
softly
bright
enough
pure
sunshine
and
pine
odours
sky
without
clouds
gentle
warmth
the
wild
azalea
in
bloom
here
and
there
white
stars
of
the
dogwood
showing
red
birds
singing
pine
martens
busy
too
with
their
courtship
pale
butterflies
flitting
the
bee
haunting
the
honeysuckle
the
snake
awakening
beauty
was
everywhere
and
in
portions
of
the
great
forest
great
as
a
principality
quiet
in
these
regions
indeed
the
stillness
might
seem
doubled
reinforced
for
from
other
stretches
of
the
wilderness
specifically
from
those
which
had
for
neighbour
the
roads
quiet
had
fled
to

of

lafayette
mclaws
with
his
able
roman
air
and
troops
in

at
the
church
they
rested
until
eleven
then
gathering
up
anderson
they
plunged
more
deeply
yet
into
the
wilderness
they
moved
in
two
columns
mclaws
leading
by
the
turnpike
anderson
in
advance
on

road
jackson
himself
with
the

of

ennobled

army
of

all

and
all

who

salute
you
going
into
the
wilderness
this
may
day
with
the
red
birds
singing
on
swing
the
two
columns
long
easy
bayonets
gleaming
accoutrements
jingling
colours
deep
glowing
in
the
sunshine
to
either
hand
swept
the
wilderness
great
as
a
desert
green
and
jewelled
in
the
desert
were
other
bands
great
and
hostile
bands
grey
and
blue
there
came
presently
a
clash
that
shook
the
forest
and
sent
quiet
a
fugitive
to
those
deeper
distant
haunts
three
bands
of
blue
three
grey
attacks
the
air
rocked
and
swung
the
pure
sunlight
changed
to
murk
the
birds
and
the
beasts
scampered
far
the
wilderness
filled
with
shouting
the
blue
gave
back
gave
back
somewhat
too
easily
the
grey
followed
would
have
followed
at
height
of
speed
keen
and
shouting
but
there
rode
to
the
front
a
leader
on
a
sorrel
nag
general
anderson
halt
your
men
throw
out
skirmishers
and
flanking
parties
and
advance
with
caution
mclaws
on
the
turnpike
had
like
orders
through
the
wilderness
through
the
gold
afternoon
all
went
quietly
sound
of
marching
feet
beat
of
hoof
creak
of
leather
rumble
of
wheel
orders
were
there
but
no
singing
laughing
talking
skirmishers
and
flanking
parties
were
alert
but
the
men
in
the
main
column
moved
dreamily
the
spell
of
the
place
upon
them
with
flowering
thorn
and
dogwood
and
the
purple
smear
of
the
judas
tree
with
the
faint
gilt
of
the
sunshine
and
with
wandering
gracious
odours
with
its
tangled
endlessness
and
feel
as
of
old
time
its
taste
of
sadness
its
hint
of
patience
it
was
such
a
of
woodland
as
might
have
environed
the
court
palace
and
princess
the
great
dome
of
the
sky
sprung
cloudless
there
was
no
wind
all
things
seemed
halted
as
if
they
had
been
thus
forever
the
men
almost
nodded
as
they
marched
back
steadily
though
slowly
gave
the
blue
skirmishers
before
the
grey
skirmishers
so
thickly
grew
the
wilderness
that
it
was
somewhat
like
indian
fighting
and
no
man
saw
a
hundred
yards
in
front
of
him
stonewall
jackson
eyes
glinted
under
the
forage
cap
perhaps
he
saw
more
than
a
hundred
yards
ahead
of
him
but
if
so
he
saw
with
the
eyes
of
the
mind
he
was
moving
very
slowly
more
like
a
tortoise
than
a
thunderbolt
the
men
said
that
old
jack

spring
fever
grey
columns
grey
artillery
grey

all
came
under

to
within
a

sunken
in

and
misty
wilderness
where
the
shadows
were
lengthening
and
the
birds
were
at
evensong
in
a
moment
the
evensong
was
hushed
and
the
birds
flew
away
the

explanation
of

two
hours
of

from

great
entrenchments
on
the

along

on
the
plateau
of

grove
burst
a
raking
artillery
fire
the
shells
shrieked
across
the
open
plunged
into
the
wood
and
exploded
before
every
hooker
had
guns

commanded

on
three
sides

formidable
position
he
had
seized

wish
you
to
ride
with

to
some
point
from
which

enfiladed
order
major

forward
with
a

this
was
the
heart
of
the
wilderness
thick
thick
grew
the
trees
and
the
underbrush
stuart
and
stonewall
jackson
staff
behind
them
pursued
a
bridle
path
overarched
by
dogwood
and
judas
tree
it
led
at
last
to
a
rise
of
ground
covered
by
matted
growth
towered
above
by
a
few
pines
four
guns
of
the
horse
artillery
strove
too
to
reach
the
place
they
made
it
at
last
over
and
through
the
wild
tangle
but
so
narrow
was
the
clearing
made
hurriedly
to
either
side
of
the
path
that
but
one
gun
at
a
time
could
be
brought
into
position
beckham
commanding
now
where
pelham
had
commanded
sent
a
shell
singing
against
the
not
distant
line
of
smoke
and
flame
the
muzzle
had
hardly
blazed
when
two
masked
batteries
opened
upon
the
rise
of
ground
the
four
guns
the
artillerymen
and
artillery
horses
and
upon
stonewall
jackson
stuart
and
the
staff
the
great
blue
guns
were
firing
at
short
range
a
howling
storm
of
shot
and
shell
broke
and
continued
through
it
came
a
curt
order
major
beckham
get
your
guns
back
general
stuart
gentlemen
of
the
staff
push
out
of
range
through
the
underwood
the
guns
with
their
maddened
horses
strove
to
turn
but
the
place
was
narrow
ere
the
movement
could
be
made
there
was
bitter
loss
horses
reared
and
fell
dreadfully
hurt
men
were
mown
down
falling
beside
their
pieces
it
was
a
moment
requiring
action
decisive
desperately
gallant
heroically
intelligent
the
horse
artillery
drew
off
their
guns
even
got
their
wounded
out
of
the
intolerable
zone
of
fire
stonewall
jackson
with
stuart
watched
them
do
it
he
nodded
good
good
out
of
the
raking
fire
back
in
the
scrub
and
pine
there
came
to
a
halt
near
him
a
gun
a
howitzer
he
sat
little
sorrel
in
the
last
golden
light
a
light
that
bathed
also
the
piece
and
its
gunners
the
federal
batteries
were
lessening
fire
there
was
a
sense
of
pause
the
two
foes
had
seen
each
other
now
army
of
northern
virginia
army
of
the
potomac
they
must
draw
breath
a
little
before
they
struck
before
they
clenched
the
sun
was
setting
the
cannonade
ceased
jackson
sat
very
still
in
the
gold
patch
where
between
two
pines
the
west
showed
clear
the
aureate
light
streaming
on
beat
full
upon
the
howitzer
and
on
the
living
and
unwounded
of
its
men
stonewall
jackson
spoke
to
an
aide
tell
the
captain
of
the
battery
that
i
should
like
to
speak
to
him
the
captain
came
captain
what
is
the

there
the

by
the
limber
with
his
head
turned
away
the

looked
deaderick
sir
philip
deaderick
when
did
he
volunteer
the
other
considered
i
think
general
it
was
just
before
it
was
just
after
the
battle
of
groveton
sir
sharpsburg
i
remember
now
so
he
rejoined
at
manassas
he
had
been
in
earlier
sir
he
had
an
accident
he
said
he
a
fine
soldier
but
he
a
silent
kind
of
a
man
he
keeps
to
himself
he
wo
take
promotion
tell
him
to
come
here
deaderick
came
the
gold
in
this
open
place
before
the
clear
west
was
very
light
and
fine
it
illuminated
also
the
place
was
a
little
withdrawn
no
one
very
near
and
by
comparison
with
the
tornado
which
had
raged
the
stillness
seemed
complete
the
gunner
stood
before
the
general
quiet
stonewall
jackson
his
gauntleted
hands
folded
over
the
saddle
bow
gazed
upon
him
fully
and
long
the
gold
light
held
and
the
hush
of
the
place
in
the
distance
in
the
wilderness
the
birds
began
again
their
singing
at
last
jackson
spoke
the
army
will
rest
headquarters
will
be
yonder
by
the
road
report
to
me
there
at
ten
i
will
listen
to
what
you
have
to
say
that
is
all
now
night
stole
over
the
wilderness
a
night
of
large
mild
stars
of
vagrant
airs
of
balm
and
sweetness
earth
lay
in
a
tender
dream
all
about
her
her
wild
flowers
and
her
trees
the
grey
and
the
blue
soldiers
slept
too
and
one
dreamed
of
this
and
one
dreamed
of
that
alike
they
dreamed
of
home
and
country
and
cause
of
loved
women
and
loved
children
and
of
their
comrades
grey
and
blue
these
two
armies
fought
each
for
an
idea
and
they
fought
well
as
people
fight
who
fight
for
an
idea
and
that
it
was
not
a
material
thing
for
which
they
fought
but
a
concept
lifted
from
them
something
of
the
grossness
of
physical
struggle
carried
away
as
with
a
strong
wind
much
of
the
pettiness
of
war
brought
their
strife
upon
the
plane
of
heroes
there
is
a
beauty
and
a
strength
in
the
thought
of
them
grey
and
blue
sleeping
in
the
wilderness
under
the
gleam
of
worlds
the
generals
did
not
sleep
in
the
chancellor
house
north
of
the
pike
fighting
joe
hooker
held
council
with
his
commanders
of
corps
with
meade
and
sickles
and
slocum
and
howard
and
couch
out
in
the
wilderness
near
the
plank
road
with
the
light
from
a
turning
to
bronze
and
the
young
oak
leaves
about
them
there
held
council
robert
edward
lee
and
stonewall
jackson
near
them
a
war
horse
neighed
there
came
the
tramp
of
the
sentry
then
quiet
stole
upon
the
scene
the
staff
was
near
at
hand
but
staff
and
couriers
held
themselves
stiller
than
still
there
was
something
in
the
air
of
the
wilderness
they
knew
not
what
it
was
but
it
was
there
lee
and
jackson
sat
opposite
each
other
the
one
on
a
box
the
other
on
a
great
fallen
tree
on
the
earth
between
them
lay
an
unrolled
map
and
now
one
took
it
up
and
pondered
it
and
now
the
other
and
now
they
spoke
together
in
quiet
low
voices
their
eyes
on
the
map
at
their
feet
in
the
red
light
lee
spoke
i
went
myself
and
looked
upon
their
left
it
is
very
strong
an
assault
upon
their
centre
impossible
i
sent
major
talcott
and
captain
boswell
again
to
reconnoitre
they
report
the
front
fairly
impregnable
and
i
agree
with
them
that
it
is
so
the
right
here
is
general
stuart
now
to
tell
us
something
of
that
in
fighting
jacket
and
plume
jeb
stuart
came
into
the
light
he
saluted
general
lee
their
right
rests
on
the
brock
road
and
the
brock
road
is
as
clean
of
defences
as
if
gunpowder
had
never
been
invented
nor
breastworks
thought
of
he
knelt
and
took
up
the
map
here
sir
is
hunting
creek
and
here
dowdall
tavern
and
the
wilderness
church
and
here
through
the
deep
woods
runs
the
old
furnace
road
intersecting
with
the
brock
road
lee
and
his
great
lieutenant
looked
and
nodded
listening
to
his
further
report
thank
you
general
stuart
said
at
last
the
you
bring
news
upon
which
i
think
we
may
act
a
flanking
movement
by
the
furnace
and
brock
roads
it
must
be
made
with
secrecy
and
in
great
strength
and
with
rapidity
general
jackson
will
you
do
it
yes
sir
turn
his
right
and
gain
his
rear
i
shall
have
my
entire
command
yes
general
generals
mclaws
and
anderson
will
remain
with
me
demonstrate
against
these
people
and
divert
their
attention
when
can
you
start
i
will
start
at
four
sir
lee
rose
very
good
then
we
had
better
try
to
get
a
little
sleep
i
see
tom
spreading
my
blanket
the
wilderness
general
do
you
remember
in
mexico
the
trees
and
their
great
scarlet
flowers
they
grew
all
about
the
church
of
our
lady
of
i
do
know
why
i
think
of
them
a
round
of
barren
ground
towered
over
by
pines
hedged
in
by
the
oak
scrub
made
the
headquarters
of
the
commander
of
the
corps
jim
had
built
a
fire
for
the
night
wind
was
strengthening
blowing
cool
he
had
not
spared
the
pine
boughs
the
flames
leaped
and
made
the
place
ruddy
as
a
jewel
jackson
entered
an
aide
behind
him
find
out
if
a
soldier
named
deaderick
is
here
the
soldier
named
deaderick
appeared
jackson
nodded
to
the
aide
who
withdrew
then
crossing
to
the
fire
he
seated
himself
upon
a
log
it
was
late
far
and
wide
the
troops
lay
sleeping
a
pale
moon
looked
down
somewhere
off
in
the
distance
an
owl
hooted
the
wilderness
lay
still
as
the
men
then
roused
itself
and
whispered
a
little
then
sank
again
into
deathlike
quiet
the
two
men
general
and
disgraced
soldier
held
themselves
for
a
moment
quiet
as
the
wilderness
cleave
knew
most
aspects
of
the
man
sitting
on
the
log
in
the
gleam
of
the
fire
he
saw
that
there
was
not
the
mood
cold
convinced
and
stubborn
the
wintry
harshness
the
granite
hardness
which
stonewall
jackson
chiefly
used
toward
offenders
he
did
not
know
what
it
was
but
he
thought
that
his
general
had
softened
with
the
perception
there
came
a
change
in
himself
he
had
entered
this
ring
in
the
wilderness
with
a
constriction
of
the
heart
a
quick
farewell
to
whatever
in
life
he
yet
held
dear
a
farewell
certainly
to
the
soldier
life
to
the
army
to
the
guns
to
the
service
of
the
country
an
iron
bracing
of
every
nerve
to
meet
an
iron
thrust
and
now
the
thrust
had
not
yet
come
and
the
general
looked
at
him
quietly
as
one
man
looks
at
another
who
also
means
well
he
had
suffered
much
and
long
something
rose
into
his
throat
the
muscles
of
his
face
worked
slightly
he
turned
his
head
aside
jackson
waited
another
moment
then
the
other
having
recovered
himself
spoke
with
quietness
you
did
at
white
oak
swamp
take
it
upon
yourself
to
act
although
there
existed
in
your
mind
a
doubt
as
to
whether
your
orders
the
orders
you
say
you
received
would
bear
that
construction
yes
general
and
your
action
proved
a
wrong
action
it
proved
a
mistaken
action
sir
it
is
the
same
thing
it
entailed
great
loss
with
peril
of
greater
yes
general
had
the
brigade
followed
there
might
have
ensued
a
general
and
disastrous
engagement
the
enemy
were
in
force
there
i
your
action
brought
almost
the
destruction
of
your
regiment
it
brought
the
death
of
many
brave
men
and
to
a
certain
extent
endangered
the
whole
that
is
so
yes
general
it
is
so
good
there
was
an
order
delivered
to
you
the
man
from
whose
lips
you
took
it
is
dead
his
reputation
was
that
of
a
valiant
intelligent
and
trustworthy
man
hardly
one
to
misrepeat
an
important
order
that
is
so
it
is
entirely
so
sir
good
you
say
that
he
brought
to
you
such
and
such
an
order
the
order
in
effect
which
even
so
you
improperly
construed
and
improperly
acted
upon
an
order
however
which
was
never
sent
by
me
a
soldier
who
was
by
testifies
that
it
was
that
order
well
that
soldier
sir
was
a
known
liar
with
a
known
hatred
to
his
officers
yes
he
repeated
the
order
word
for
word
as
i
sent
it
how
did
that
happen
sir
i
do
not
know
the
officer
to
whom
i
gave
the
order
and
who
wrongly
enough
transferred
it
to
another
messenger
swears
that
he
gave
it
thus
and
so
yes
general
he
swears
it
a
silence
reigned
in
the
ring
the
red
light
showed
form
and
feature
clearly
jackson
sitting
on
the
log
his
large
hands
resting
on
the
sabre
across
his
knees
was
full
within
the
glow
it
beat
even
more
strongly
upon
cleave
where
he
stood
you
believe
said
jackson
that
he
swore
falsely
yes
general
it
is
a
question
between
your
veracity
and
his
yes
general
there
was
enmity
between
you
yes
general
where
is
he
now
he
is
somewhere
in
prison
he
was
taken
at
sharpsburg
there
fell
another
silence
the
sentry
tread
was
heard
the
crackle
of
the
fire
seizing
upon
pine
cone
and
bough
a
low
sighing
wind
in
the
wilderness
jackson
spoke
briefly
after
this
campaign
if
matters
so
arrange
themselves
if
the
officer
returns
if
you
think
you
can
provide
new
evidence
or
the
old
i
will
forward
approved
your
appeal
for
a
court
of
inquiry
i
thank
you
sir
with
all
my
heart
stonewall
jackson
slightly
changed
his
position
on
the
log
jim
tiptoed
into
the
ring
and
fed
again
the
fire
there
was
a
whinnying
of
some
battery
horses
the
sound
of
changing
guard
then
silence
again
in
the
wilderness
cleave
stood
straight
and
still
beneath
the
pondering
long
and
steady
gaze
an
aide
appeared
at
an
opening
in
the
scrub
general
fitzhugh
lee
sir
jackson
rose
you
will
return
to
your
battery
bring
general
lee
here
captain
the
night
passed
the
dawn
came
red
bird
and
wren
and
robin
began
a
cheeping
in
the
wilderness
a
light
mist
was
over
the
face
of
the
earth
within
it
began
a
vast
shadowy
movement
of
shadowy
troops
silence
was
so
strictly
ordered
that
something
approaching
it
was
obtained
there
was
a
certain
eeriness
in
the
hush
in
which
the
column
was
formed
the
grey
column
in
the
grey
dawn
in
the
wilderness
where
the
birds
were
cheeping
and
the
mist
hung
faint
and
cold
by
the
roadside
on
a
little
knoll
set
round
with
flowering
dogwood
sat
general
lee
on
grey
traveller
a
swirl
of
mist
below
the
two
detached
them
from
the
wide
earth
and
marching
troops
made
them
like
a
piece
of
sculpture
seen
against
the
morning

below
them
moved

noiseless
as
might
be

saluted
and
all
his

virginia
and
south
carolina
the
guns
began
to
pass
quiet
as
was
constitutionally
possible
the
very
battery
horses
looked
as
though
they
understood
that
people
who
were
going
to
turn
the
flank
of
a
gigantic
army
in
a
strong
position
proceed
upon
the
business
without
noise
up
rose
the
sun
while
the
iron
fighting
men
were
yet
going
by
the

and

gilded
the

of

and
his

and
the

upon

collar
the
sun
began
to
drink
up
the
mist
and
all
the
birds
sang
loudly
the
sky
was
cloudless
the
low
thick
woodland
divinely
cool
and
sweet
violet
and

were
all
bespangled
bespangled
with

while
the
guns
were
yet
quietly
rumbling
by
stonewall
jackson
appeared
upon
the
rising
ground
he
saluted
lee
put
out
his
hand
and
clasped
the
other
general
i
feel
every
confidence
i
am
sure
that
you
are
going
forth
to
victory
yes
sir
i
think
that
i
i
will
send
a
courier
back
every
half
hour
yes
that
is
as
soon
as
your
wagons
are
by
i
will
make
disposition
of
the
twelve
thousand
left
with
me
i
propose
a
certain
display
of
artillery
and
a
line
of
battle
so
formed
as
to
deceive
and
deceive
greatly
as
to
its
strength
if
necessary
we
will
skirmish
hotly
throughout
the
day
i
will
create
the
impression
that
we
are
about
to
assault
it
is
imperative
that
they
do
not
come
between
us
and
cut
the
army
in
two
i
will
march
as
rapidly
as
may
be
sir
the
furnace

the
brock

then
turn
eastward
on
the
plank
road
and
strike
their
flank
good
he
jerked
his
hand
into
the
air
i
will
go
now
general
lee
bent
across
again
the
two
clasped
hands
god
be
with
you
general
jackson
and
with
you
general
lee
little
sorrel
left
the
hillock
the
staff
came
up
stonewall
jackson
turned
in
his
saddle
and
the
staff
following
his
action
raised
his
hand
in
salute
to
the
figure
on
grey
traveller
above
them
in
the
sunlight
lee
lifted
his
hat
held
it
so
the
others
filed
by
turned
sharply
southward
and
were
lost
in
the
jewelled
wilderness
the
sun
cleared
the
tallest
pines
there
set
in
a
splendid
day
the
long
long
column
cavalry
rodes
division
the
light
division
the
artillery
ordnance
wagons
and
ambulances
thousand
grey
soldiers
with
stonewall
jackson
at
their
head
the
long
long
column
wound
through
the
wilderness
by
narrow
hidden
roads
close
came
the
scrub
and
pine
and
all
the
flowering
trees
of
may
the
horsemen
put
aside
vine
and
bough
the
pink
honeysuckle
brushed
the
gun
wheels
long
stretches
of
the
road
were
through
the
woods
to
the
right
by
paths
nearer
yet
to
the
federal
front
paced
ten
guardian
squadrons
all
went
silently
all
went
swiftly
in
the
confederate
service
there
were
no
automata
these
thousands
of
lithe
bronzed
tattered
men
knew
that
something
something
something
was
being
done
something
important
that
they
must
all
help
old
jack
with
forbidden
to
talk
they
speculated
inwardly
south
by
west
is
a
thoroughfare
gap
march
they
all
here
in
the
wilderness
we
leaving
their
centre
their
right
somewhere
over
there
in
the
brush
should
wonder
allan
gold
what
the
latin
for
flank
lieutenant
we
were
just
whispering
yes
all
right
sir
we
wo
make
no
more
noise
than
so
many
wet
cartridges
on
they
swung
through
the
fairy
forest
grey
steady
rapidly
moving
the
steel
above
their
shoulders
gleaming
bright
the
worn
colours
like
flowers
amid
the
tender
green
the
head
of
the
column
came
to
a
dip
in
the
wilderness
through
which
flowed
a
little
creek
it
was
about
nine
in
the
morning
all
the
men
looked
to
the
right
for
they
could
see
the
plateau
of
hazel
grove
and
the
great
federal
intrenchments
if
those
fellows
look
right
hard
they
can
see
us
too
ca
help
it
march
fast
and
get
oh
that
what
the
officers
think
too
the
column
crossed
the
tiny
vale
beyond
it
the
narrow
road
of
bends
and
turns
plunged
due
south
now
general
birney
stationed
on
the
high
level
of
hazel
grove
observed
though
somewhat
faintly
that
movement
he
sent
a
courier
to
hooker
at
chancellorsville
rebel
column
seen
to
pass
across
my
front
all
arms
and
wagon
train
it
has
turned
to
the
southward
to
the
south
said
hooker
turned
southward
now
what
does
that
mean
it
might
mean
that
sedgwick
at
fredericksburg
has
seized
and
is
holding
the
road
to
richmond
it
might
mean
that
lee
contemplated
an
unobstructed
retreat
through
this
wilderness
section
southward
to
gordonsville
which
is
not
far
away
from
gordonsville
he
would
fall
back
on
richmond
say
that
is
what
he
planned
then
finding
me
in
strength
across
his
path
he
would
naturally
make
some
demonstration
and
behind
it
inaugurate
a
forced
march
southward
out
of
this
wild
place
a
retreat
to
gordonsville
it
the
most
probable
move
i
will
send
general
sickles
toward
catherine
furnace
to
find
out
exactly
birney
from
hazel
grove
sickles
from
chancellorsville
advanced
at
catherine
furnace
they
found
the
georgia
and
on
both
sides
of
the
plank
road
discovered
anderson
division
now
began
hot
fighting
in
the
wilderness
the
brigades
of
anderson
did
gloriously
the
georgia
surrounded
at
the
furnace
saw
fall
in
that
square
of
the
wilderness
three
hundred
officers
and
men
but
those
georgians
who
yet
stood
did
well
did
well
full
in
the
front
of
chancellorsville
mclaws
with
his
able
roman
air
his
high
colour
short
black
beard
and
crisp
speech

his
troops
like
a
rightly
trusted
captain
of
caesar
he
kept
the
enemy
attention
strained
in
his
direction
standing
yet
upon
the
little
hillock
in
the
midst
of
the
flowering
dogwood
a
greater
than
mclaws
overlooked
and
directed
all
the
grey
pieces
upon
the
board
before
chancellorsville
played
all
day
like
a
master
a
skilfully
complicated
game
far
in
the
wilderness
miles
now
to
the
westward
the
rolling
musketry
came
to
the
ears
of
stonewall
jackson
he
was
riding
with
rodes
at
the
head
of
the
column
good
good
he
said
that
musketry
is
at
the
furnace
general
hooker
will
attempt
to
drive
between
me
and
general
lee
an
aide
of
hill
approached
at
a
gallop
he
saluted
gained
breath
and
spoke
they
cutting
the
georgia
to
pieces
sir
general
anderson
is
coming
into
action
a
deeper
thunder
rolling
now
through
the
wilderness
corroborated
his
words
good
good
said
jackson
imperturbably
my
compliments
to
general
hill
and
he
will
detach
archer
and
thomas
brigades
and
a
battalion
of
artillery
they
are
to
cooperate
with
general
anderson
and
protect
our
rear
the
remainder
of
the
light
division
will
continue
the
march
on
past
the
noon
point
swung
light
and
shadow
on
through
the
languorous
may
warmth
travelled
westward
the
long
column
it
went
with
marked
rapidity
emphatic
even
for
the
foot
cavalry
went
without
swerving
without
straggling
went
like
a
long
gleaming
thunderbolt
firmly
held
and
swung
behind
it
sank
in
the
distance
the
noise
of
battle
the
army
of
northern
virginia
knew
itself
divided
cut
in
two
far
back
in
the
flowering
woods
before
chancellorsville
the
man
on
the
grey
horse
directing
here
directing
there
his
twelve
thousand
men
played
his
master
game
with
equanimity
trusting
in
stonewall
jackson
rushing
toward
the
federal
right
westward
in
the
wilderness
swiftly
nearing
the
brock
road
the
man
on
the
sorrel
nag
travelled
with
no
backward
look
in
his
right
hand
was
the
thunderbolt
and
near
at
hand
the
place
from
which
to
hurl
it
he
rode
like
incarnate
intention
the
officer
beside
him
said
something
as
to
that
enormous
peril
in
the
rear
driving
like
a
wedge
between
this
hurrying
column
and
the
grey
twelve
thousand
before
chancellorsville
yes
sir
yes
said
jackson
but
i
trust
first
in
god
and
then
in
general
lee
the
infantry
swung
into
the
brock
road
it
ran
northward
it
lay
bare
sunny
sleepy
walled
in
by
emerald
leaves
and
white
and
purple
bloom
the
grey
thunderbolt
travelled
fast
fast
and
at
three
its
head
reached
the
plank
road
far
to
the
east
in
the
wilderness
the
noise
of
the
battle
yet
rolled
but
it
came
fainter
with
a
diminishing
sound
anderson
thomas
and
archer
had
driven
back
sickles
there
was
a
pause
by
chancellorsville
and
catherine
furnace
through
it
and
all
the
while
the
man
on
grey
traveller
kept
with
a
skill
so
exquisite
that
it
shaded
into
a
grave
simplicity
those
thousands
and
thousands
and
thousands
of
hostile
eyes
turned
quite
from
their
real
danger
centred
only
on
a
finely
painted
mask
of
danger
at
the
intersection
of
the
brock
and
the
plank
roads
stonewall
jackson
found
massed
the
virginia
cavalry
upon
the
road
and
to
either
side
in
the
flowering
woods
roan
and
bay
and
black
tossed
their
heads
and
moved
their
limbs
amid
silver

and
rose

the

the

looked
at

anxious
and
exultant
fitzhugh

met
the

in

the

spoke
three
proceed
at

down

i

sir
said
the
other
that
you
will
ride
with
me
to
the
top
of
this
roll
of
ground
in
front
of
us
i
can
show
you
the
strangest
thing
the
two
went
attended
only
by
a
courier
the
slight
eminence
all
clad
with
all
carpeted
with
wild
flowers
was
reached
the
horsemen
turned
and
looked
eastward
the
scrub
the
few
young
trees
sheltering
them
from
view
they
looked
eastward
and
in
the
distance
they
saw
dowdall
tavern
but
it
was
not
dowdall
tavern
that
was
the
strangest
thing
the
strangest
thing
was
nearer
than
dowdall
it
was
at
no
great
distance
at
all
it
was
a
long
abattis
and
behind
the
abattis
long
breastworks
behind
the
breastworks
overlooked
by
the
little
hill
and
occupying
an
old
clearing
in
the
wilderness
was
a
large
encampment
the
encampment
in
short
of
the
army
corps
howard
commanding
twenty
regiments
and
six
batteries
from
the
little
hill
where
the
violets
purpled
the
ground
stonewall
jackson
and
the
cavalry
leader
looked
and
looked
in
silence
the
blue
soldiers
lay
at
ease
on
the
tender
sward
it
was
far
in
the
wilderness
the
arms
were
stacked
the
arms
were
stacked
there
were
cannon
planted
by
the
roadside
but
where
were
the
cannoneers
not
very
near
the
guns
but
asleep
on
the
grass
or
propped
against
trees
smoking
excellent
tobacco
or
in
the
square
on
the
greensward
playing
cards
with
laughter
battery
horses
were
grazing
where
they
would
far
and
wide
were
scattered
the
infantry
squandered
like
plums
on
the
grass
they
lay
or
strolled
about
in
the
slant
sunshine
in
the
balmy
air
in
the
magic
wilderness
they
never
even
glanced
toward
the
stacked
arms
on
the
flowery
slope
across
the
road
stonewall
jackson
sat
little
sorrel
and
gazed
upon
the
pleasant
drowsy
scene
his
eyes
had
a
glow
his
cheek
a
warm
colour
beneath
the
bronze
staff
and
indeed
the
entire
corps
had
remarked
from
time
to
time
this
spring
upon
old
evident
good
health
getting
younger
all
the
time
this
war
climate
suits
him
time
the
peace
articles
are
signed
he
be
just
a
boy
again
arrived
at
what
do
you
call
it
perennial
youth
now
he
and
little
sorrel
stood
upon
the
flowering
hilltop
and
his
lips
moved
old
praying
old
jack
praying
thought
the
courier
fitz
lee
said
something
but
the
general
did
not
attend
in
another
moment
however
he
spoke
curt
decisive
final
he
spoke
to
the
courier
tell
general
rodes
to
move
the
plank
road
he
is
to
halt
at
the
turnpike
i
will
join
him
there
move
quietly
the
courier
turned
and
went
stonewall
jackson
regarded
again
the
scene
before
him
abattis
and
breastworks
and
untenanted
guns
lonely
in
the
slanting
sunlight
lines
of
stacked
arms
tents
fluttering
flags
the
horses
straying
at
their
will
cropping
the
tender
grass
in

of

butchering

regarded
the

regarded

and
wisconsin
camped
about
the
wilderness
church
up
from
the
clearing
across
to
the
thick
forest
floated
an
indescribable
humming
sound
a
confused
droning
as
from
a
giant
race
of
bees
the
shadows
of
the
trees
were
growing
long
the
sun
hung
just
above
the
pines
of
the

stonewall
jackson
his
eyes
beneath
the
old
old

a
sapphire
depth
and
gleam
a
colour
was
in
his
cheek
good
good
he
said
and
jerked
his
hand
into
the
air
suddenly
turning
little
sorrel
he
left
the
hill
riding
fast
elbows
out
and
big
feet
down
into

high
over

the

there
followed
a
rush
of
bodies
through
the

in
a
moment
was
heard
the
crackling
fire
of
the
skirmishers
from
ahead
came
a

beating

rang
the

several
miles
to

the
large

of

set
upon
rising
ground
reflected
the
sun
from
its
westerly
windows
all
about
it
rolled
the
wilderness
shadowy
beneath
the
vivid
skies
it
lay
like
a
sea
touching
all
the
horizon
on
the
deep
porch
of
the
house
tasting
the
evening
coolness
sat
fighting
joe
hooker
and
several
of
his
officers
eastward
there
was
firing
as
there
had
been
all
day
but
it
too
was
decreased
in

broken
in

the

body
thought
the

must
be
about
ready
to
draw
off

the

advance
in
its
desperate
attempt

get
out

to
get
off

eastward
there
had
a
desultory
waiting
sound
from
the
south
several
miles
into
the
depth
of
the
wilderness
came
a
slow
uninterrupted
booming
of
cannon
pleasanton
and
sickles
were
down
there
somewhere
beyond
catherine
furnace
pleasanton
and
sickles
were
giving
chase
to
the
rebel
detachment
whatever
it
was
stonewall
jackson
and
a
division
probably
that
was
trying
to
get
out
of
the

at
any
rate
the

force
was
divided
when
morning
dawned
it
should
be
pounded
small
piece

by
the

we
got
the

we
got

we
got
the
finest

dropped
the

the

to

it

there
was
a
perception
of
a
vastness
not
comprehended
one
of
the
men
upon
the
chancellor
porch
cleared
his
throat
there
an
awful
feeling
about
this
place
it
poetic
i
suppose
anyhow
it
makes
you
feel
that
anything
might
happen
the
stranger
it
was
the
likelier
to
happen
i
do
feel
that
way
it
just
a
great
big
rolling
plain
with
woods
upon
it
no
mountains
or
water
well
i
always
thought
that
if
i
were
a
great
big
thing
going
to
happen
i
would
choose
a
chopped
up
picturesque
place
to
happen
in

in

uproar
the

had
slipped
they
lost
themselves
in
the

there
came
perforce
a
pause
a
quest
for
organization
and
alignment
a
drawing

a
compressing

rode
along

there
was
a

drawn
across
this
way
through
the

on
the

and
in
the
woods
on
either
hand
in
places
in
the
wilderness
the
scrub
that
fearfully
burned
the
next
day
and
the
next
was
even
now
afire
and
gave
though
uncertainly
and
dimly
a
certain
illumination
by
it
the

it
seemed
composed
of
tall
and
shadowy

they
stood
and
listened
hooker
reserves
were
up
about
the
chancellor
house
on
the
chancellorsville
ridge
they
were
throwing
up
entrenchments
they
were
digging
the
earth
with
bayonets
they
were
heaping
it
up
with
their
hands
there
was
a
ringing
of
axes
they
were
cutting
down
the
young
spring

they
were
making

a
dead

mantling
a

sat
his

and
looked

off

he
said
never

he
jerked
his
hand
into
the
air
turning
little
sorrel
he
rode
back
along
the
plank
road
toward
his
own
lines
the
light
of
the
burning
brush
had
sunken
the
cannon
smoke
floating
in

the
very
thick

carolinians
awaiting

a
little
to

broke
out
in
the
wilderness
a
sudden
rattling
fire
sinking
rising
sinking
again
the
blue
and
grey
skirmishers
now
in
touch
all
through
the
vast
dark
tangled
beating
heart
of
the
place
sprang
into
being
a
tension
the
grey
lines
listened
for
the
word
the
musket
rested
on
the
shoulder
the
foot
quivered
eyes
front
tried
to
pierce
the
darkness
sound
was
unceasing
and
yet
the
mind
found
a
stillness
a
lake
of
calm
it
was
the
moment
before
the
moment
stonewall
jackson
came
toward
the
carolinians
he
rode
quickly
past
the
dark
shell
of
a
house
sunken
among
pines
there
were
with
him
seven
or
eight
persons
the
horses
hoofs
made
a
trampling
on
the
plank
road
the
woods
were
deep
the
obscurity
great
suddenly
out
of
the
brush
rang
a
shot
an
accidentally
discharged
rifle
some
grey
soldier
among
tensely
waiting
ranks
dressed
in
the
woods
to
the
right
of
the
road
spoke
from
the
core
of
a
fearful
dream
yankee
cavalry
called
an
officer
of
the
north
carolina
the
volley
striking
diagonally
across
the
road
emptied
several
saddles
stonewall
jackson
the
aides
and
wilbourne
wheeled
to
the
left
dug
spur
and
would
have
plunged
into
the
wood
said
the
carolinians
dressed
to
the
left
of
the
road
and
fired
little
sorrel
maddened
dashed
into
the
wood
an
oak
bough
struck
his
rider
almost
bearing
him
from
the
saddle
with
his
right
hand
from
which
the
blood
was
streaming
in
which
a
bullet
was
imbedded
he
caught
the
bridle
managed
to
turn
the
agonized
brute
into
the
road
again
there
seemed
a
wild
sound
a
confusion
of
voices
some
one
had
stopped
the
firing
my
god
men
you
are
firing
into
in
the
road
were
the
aides
they
caught
the
rein
stopped
the

wilbourne
put
up
his

general
general

hold

morrison
leigh
they
laid
him
on
the
ground
beneath
the
pines
and
they
fired
the
brushwood
for
a
light
one
rode
off
for
mcguire
and
another
with
a
penknife
cut
away
the
sleeve
from
the
left
arm
through
which
had
gone
two
bullets
a
mounted
man
came
at
a
gallop
and
threw
himself
from
his
horse
it
was
hill

hill
drew
off
the
gauntlets
that
were
all
blood
soaked
and
with
his
handkerchief
tried
to
bind
up
the
arm
shattered
and
with
the
main
artery
cut
a
courier
came
up
sir
sir
a
body
of
the
enemy
is
close
at
hand
the
aides
lifted
the
wounded
general
no
one
said
hill
must
tell
the
troops
who
was
wounded
the
other
opened
his
eyes
tell
them
simply
that
you
have
a
wounded

you
are
in

now
press
right
on
with
a
gesture
of
sorrow
hill
went
returning
to
the
front
the
others
rested
at
the
edge
of
the
road
at
that
moment
the
federal
batteries
opened
a
hissing
storm
of
shot
and
shell
a
tornado
meant
measurably
to
retard
that
anticipated
grey
onrush
the
range
was
high
aides
and
couriers
laid
the
wounded
leader
on
the
earth
and
made
of
their
bodies
a
screen
the
trees
were
cut
the
earth
was
torn
up
there
was
a
howling
as
of
unchained
fiends
there
passed
what
seemed
an
eternity
and
was
but
ten
minutes
the
great
blue
guns
slightly
changed
the
direction
of
their
fire
the
storm
howled
away
from
the
group
by
the
road
and
the
men
again
lifted
jackson
he
stood
now
on
his
feet
and
because
troops
were
heard
approaching
and
because
it
must
not
be
known
that
he
was
hurt
all
moved
into
the
darkness
of
the
scrub
the
troops
upon
the
road
came
on
pender
brigade
pender
riding
in
advance
saw
the
group
and
asked
who
was
wounded
a
field
officer
answered
one
but
there
came
from
some
direction
a
glare
of
light
and
by
it
pender
knew
he
sprang
from
his
horse
do
say
anything
about
it
general
pender
said
jackson

a

and
brought
and

laid
upon

the
little
procession
moved
toward
dowdall

a
shot
pierced
the
arm
of
one
of
the
bearers
loosening
his
hold
of
the
litter
it
tilted
the
general
fell
heavily
to
the
ground
injuring
afresh
the
wounded
limb
striking
and
bruising
his
side
they
raised
him
pale
now
and
silent
and
at
last
they
struggled
through
the
wood
to
a
little
clearing
where
they
found
an
ambulance
now
too
came
the
doctor
a
man
whom
he
loved

knelt
beside
him

note
and

it
to
the
field
hospital
near
dowdall
tavern
i
can
not
express
my
regret

your
skill
and
energy

respectfully
your
obedient
servant

it
to
stonewall
jackson
where
he
lay
very
quiet
in
the
deeps
of
the
wilderness
for
a
minute
he
did
not
speak
then
he
said
general
lee
is
very
kind
but
he
should
give
the
praise
to
god
for
four
days
yet
they
fought
in
the
wilderness
at
salem
church
at
the
fords
of

they
rested

potomac
back
on
the

jackson
was
carefully
moved
from
the
wilderness
to
guiney
station
here
was
a
large
old
residence
the
chandler
house
within
a
sweep
of
grass
and
trees
about
it
one
or
two
small
buildings
the
great
house
was
filled
crowded
to
its
doors
with
wounded
soldiers
so
they
laid
stonewall
jackson
in
a
rude
cabin
among
the
trees
the
left
arm
had
been
amputated
in
the
field
hospital
he
was
thought
to
be
doing
well
though
at
times
he
complained
of
the
side
which
in
the
fall
from
the
litter
had
been
struck
and
bruised
at
daylight
on
thursday
he
had
his
physician
called
i
am
suffering
great
pain
he
said
see
what
is
the
matter
with
me
and
presently
is
it
pneumonia
that
afternoon
his
wife
came
he
was
roused
to
speak
to
her
greeted
her
with
love
then
sank
into
something
like
stupor
from
time
to
time
he
awakened
from
this
but
there
were
also
times
when
he
was
slightly
delirious
he
gave
orders
in
a
shadow
of
the
old
voice
you
must
hold
out
a
little
longer
men
you
must
hold
out
a
little
longer

major
pelham
friday
went
by
and
saturday
the
afternoon
of
this
day
he
asked
for
his
chaplain
lacy
later
in
the
twilight
his
wife
sang
to
him
old
hymns
that
he
loved
sing
the
psalm
in
verse
he
said
she
sang
show
pity
lord
o
lord
forgive
the
night
passed
and
sunday
the
tenth
dawned
he
lay
quiet
his
right
hand
on
his
breast
one
of
the
staff
came
for
a
moment
to
his
bedside
who
is
preaching
at
headquarters
he
was
told
and
said
good
i
wish
i
might
be
there
the
officer
voice
broke
general
general
the
whole
army
is
praying
for
you
there
a
message
from
general
lee
yes
yes
give
it
he
sends
you
his
love
he
says
that
you
must
recover
that
you
have
lost
your
left
arm
but
that
he
would
lose
his
right
arm
he
says
tell
you
that
he
prayed
for
you
last
night
as
he
had
never
prayed
for
himself
he
repeats
what
he
said
in
his
note
that
for
the
good
of
virginia
and
the
south
he
could
wish
that
he
were
lying
here
in
your
place
the
soldier
on
the
bed
smiled
a
little
and
shook
his
head
better
ten
jacksons
should
lie
here
than
one
lee
it
was
sunny
weather
fair
and
sweet
with
all
the
bloom
of
may
the
bright
trees
waving
the
long
grass
rippling
waters
flowing
the
sky
azure
bees
about
the
flowers
the
birds
singing
piercingly
sweet
mother
earth
so
beautiful
the
sky
the
light
of
the
sun
so
gracious
warm
and
vital
a
little
before
noon
kneeling
beside
him
his
wife
told
stonewall
jackson
that
he
would
die
he
smiled
and
laid
his
hand
upon
her
bowed
head
you
are
frightened
my
child
death
is
not
so
near
i
may
yet
get
well
the
doctor
came
to
him
doctor
anna
tells
me
that
i
am
to
die
is
it
so
oh
general
general
it
is
so
he
lay
silent
a
moment
then
he
said
very
good
very
good
it
is
all
right
throughout
the
day
his
mind
was
now
clouded
now
clear
in
one
of
the
latter
times
he
said
there
was
something
he
was
trying
to
remember
there
followed
a
of
broken
sleep
and
wandering
in
the
course
of
which
he
twice
spoke
a
name
deaderick
once
he
said
horse
artillery
and
once
white
oak
swamp
the
alternate
clear
moments
and
the
lapses
into
stupour
or
delirium
were
like
the
sinking
or
rising
of
a
strong
swimmer
exhausted
at
last
the
prey
at
last
of
a
shoreless
sea
at
times
he
came
head
and
shoulders
out
of
the
sea
in
such
a
moment
he
opened
his
eyes
full
on
one
of
his
staff
all
the
staff
was
gathered
in
grief
about
the
bed
when
richard
cleave
he
said
asks
for
a
court
of
enquiry
let
him
have
it
tell
general
lee
the
sea
drew
him
under
again
it
hardly
let
him
go
any
more
moment
by
moment
now
it
wore
out
the
strong
swimmer
the
day
drew
on
to
afternoon
he
lay
straight
upon
the
bed
silent
for
the
most
part
but
now
and
then
wandering
a
little
his
wife
bowed
herself
beside
him
in
a
corner
wept
the
old
man
jim
outside
the
windows
there
seemed
a
hush
as
of
death
pass
the
infantry
to
the
front
ordered
stonewall
jackson
tell
hill
to
prepare
for
action
the
voice
sank
there
came
a
long
silence
there
was
only
heard
the
old
man
crying
in
the
corner
then
for
the
last
time
in
this
phase
of
being
the
great
soldier
opened
his
eyes
in
a
moment
he
spoke
in
a
very
sweet
and
calm
voice
let
us
cross
over
the
river
and
rest
under
the
shade
of
the
trees
he
died
the
bells
tolled
the
bells
tolled
in
richmond
tolled
from
each
of
her
seven
hills
sombre
was
the
sound
of
the
minute
guns
shaking
the
heart
of
the
city
oh
this
capital
knew
the
dead
march
in
saul
as
a
child
knows
his
lullaby
it
had
a
depth
and
a
height
and
was
a
dirge
indeed
it
wailed
for
a
chieftain
wailed
through
the
streets
where
the
rose
and
magnolia
bloomed
wailed
as
may
have
wailed
the
trumpets
when
priam
brought
hector
home
the
great
throng
to
either
side
the
streets
shivered
beneath
the
wailing
beneath
the
low
thunder
of
the
drums
there
was
lacking
no
pomp
of
war
war
who
must
have
gauds
with
which
to
hide
his
naked
horror
the
guns
boomed
the
bells
tolled
the
muffled
drums
beat
beat
regiments
marched
with
reversed
arms
with
colours
furled
there
was
mournful
civic
pomp
mournful
official
there
came
a
great
black
hearse
drawn
by
four
white
horses
on
it
lay
the
body
of
stonewall
jackson
and
over
it
was
drawn
the
deep
blue
flag
with
the
arms
of
virginia
and
likewise
the
starry
banner
of
the
eleven
confederate
states
oh
were
the
minute
guns
and
the
tolling
tolling
bells
and
the
deep
slow
heroic
music
and
the
sobbing
of
the
people
it
was
a
cloudless
day
and
filled
with
grief
behind
the
hearse
trod
little
sorrel
beneath
arching
trees
by
houses
of
mellow
red
brick
houses
of
pale
grey
stucco

the

march
rang
and
all
the
people
on

slopes
of

historic
place
uncovered
their
heads
and
wept
the
coffin
passed
upward
and
between
the
great
white
doric
columns
it
passed
into
the
capitol
and
into
the
hall
of
the

house

was

a

tall

with
a
quiet
studious

he
looked
now
at
the
vaulted
roof
as
though
he
saw
instead
the
sky
he
spoke
in
a
controlled

voice
what
stonewall

always
said
was
just
this
forward
