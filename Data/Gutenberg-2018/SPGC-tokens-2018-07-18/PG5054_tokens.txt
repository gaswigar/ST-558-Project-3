the
dream
doctor
jameson
i
want
you
to
get
the
real
story
about
that
friend
of
yours
professor
kennedy
announced
the
managing
editor
of
the
star
early
one
afternoon
when
i
had
been
summoned
into
the
sanctum
from
a
batch
of
letters
that
had
accumulated
in
the
litter
on
the
top
of
his
desk
he
selected
one
and
glanced
over
it
hurriedly
for
instance
he
went
on
reflectively
here
a
letter
from
a
constant
reader
who
asks
this
professor
craig
kennedy
really
all
that
you
say
he
is
and
if
so
how
can
i
find
out
about
his
new
scientific
detective
method
he
paused
and
tipped
back
his
chair
now
i
do
want
to
file
these
letters
in
the
waste
basket
when
people
write
letters
to
a
newspaper
it
means
something
i
might
reply
in
this
case
that
he
is
as
real
as
science
as
real
as
the
fight
of
society
against
the
criminal
but
i
want
to
do
more
than
that
the
editor
had
risen
as
if
shaking
himself
momentarily
loose
from
the
ordinary
routine
of
the
office
you
get
me
he
went
on
enthusiastically
in
other
words
your
assignment
jameson
for
the
next
month
is
to
do
nothing
except
follow
your
friend
kennedy
start
in
right
now
on
the
first
and
out
of
his
life
just
one
month
an
average
month
take
things
just
as
they
come
set
them
down
just
as
they
happen
and
when
you
get
through
give
me
an
intimate
picture
of
the
man
and
his
work
he
picked
up
the
schedule
for
the
day
and
i
knew
that
the
interview
was
at
an
end
i
was
to
get
kennedy
often
i
had
written
snatches
of
craig
adventures
but
never
before
anything
as
ambitious
as
this
assignment
for
a
whole
month
at
first
it
staggered
me
but
the
more
i
thought
about
it
the
better
i
liked
it
i
hastened
uptown
to
the
apartment
on
the
heights
which
kennedy
and
i
had
occupied
for
some
time
i
say
we
occupied
it
we
did
so
during
those
hours
when
he
was
not
at
his
laboratory
at
the
chemistry
building
on
the
university
campus
or
working
on
one
of
those
cases
which
fascinated
him
fortunately
he
happened
to
be
there
as
i
burst
in
upon
him
well
he
queried
absently
looking
up
from
a
book
one
of
the
latest
untranslated
treatises
on
the
new
psychology
from
the
pen
of
the
eminent
scientist
freud
of
vienna
what
brings
you
uptown
so
early
briefly
as
i
could
i
explained
to
him
what
it
was
that
i
proposed
to
do
he
listened
without
comment
and
i
rattled
on
determined
not
to
allow
him
to
negative
it
and
i
added
warming
up
to
the
subject
i
think
i
owe
a
debt
of
gratitude
to
the
managing
editor
he
has
crystallised
in
my
mind
an
idea
that
has
long
been
latent
why
craig
i
went
on
that
is
exactly
what
you
want
to
show
people
how
they
can
never
hope
to
beat
the
modern
scientific
detective
to
show
that
the
have
gone
ahead
faster
even
than
the
telephone
tinkled
insistently
without
a
word
kennedy
motioned
to
me
to
listen
in
on
the
extension
on
my
desk
which
he
had
placed
there
as
a
precaution
so
that
i
could
corroborate
any
conversation
that
took
place
over
our
wire
his
action
was
quite
enough
to
indicate
to
me
that
at
least
he
had
no
objection
to
the
plan
this
is
leslie
the
coroner
can
you
come
to
the
municipal
hospital
right
away
right
away
doctor
answered
craig
hanging
up
the
receiver
walter
you
come
too
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
we
were
in
the
courtyard
of
the
largest
hospital
in
the
balmy
sunshine
the
convalescing
patients
were
sitting
on
benches
or
slowly
trying
their
strength
walking
over
the
grass
clad
in
faded
hospital
bathrobes
we
entered
the
office
and
quickly
were
conducted
by
an
orderly
to
a
little
laboratory
in
a
distant
wing
what
the
matter
asked
craig
as
we
hurried
along
i
do
know
exactly
replied
the
man
except
that
it
seems
that
price
maitland
the
broker
you
know
was
picked
up
on
the
street
and
brought
here
dying
he
died
before
the
doctors
could
relieve
him
leslie
was
waiting
impatiently
for
us
what
do
you
make
of
that
professor
kennedy
the
coroner
spread
out
on
the
table
before
us
a
folded
of
typewriting
and
searched
craig
face
eagerly
to
see
what
impression
it
made
on
him
we
found
it
stuffed
in
maitland
outside
coat
pocket
he
explained
it
was
dateless
and
brief
dearest
madeline
may
god
in
his
mercy
forgive
me
for
what
i
am
about
to
do
i
have
just
seen
ross
he
has
told
me
the
nature
of
your
illness
i
can
not
bear
to
think
that
i
am
the
cause
so
i
am
going
simply
to
drop
out
of
your
life
i
can
not
live
with
you
and
i
can
not
live
without
you
do
not
blame
me
always
think
the
best
you
can
of
me
even
if
you
could
not
give
me
all
your
distracted
husband
price
at
once
the
idea
flashed
over
me
that
maitland
had
found
himself
suffering
from
some
incurable
disease
and
had
taken
the
quickest
means
of
settling
his
dilemma
kennedy
looked
up
suddenly
from
the
note
do
you
think
it
was
a
suicide
asked
the
coroner
suicide
craig
repeated
suicides
do
usually
write
on
typewriters
a
hasty
note
scrawled
on
a
sheet
of
paper
in
trembling
pen
or
pencil
that
is
what
they
usually
leave
no
some
one
tried
to
escape
the
handwriting
experts
this
way
exactly
my
idea
agreed
leslie
with
evident
satisfaction
now
listen
maitland
was
conscious
almost
up
to
the
last
moment
and
yet
the
hospital
doctors
tell
me
they
could
not
get
a
syllable
of
an
statement
from
him
you
mean
he
refused
to
talk
i
asked
no
he
replied
it
was
more
perplexing
than
that
even
if
the
police
had
not
made
the
usual
blunder
of
arresting
him
for
intoxication
instead
of
sending
him
immediately
to
the
hospital
it
would
have
made
no
difference
the
doctors
simply
could
not
have
saved
him
apparently
for
the
truth
is
professor
kennedy
we
do
even
know
what
was
the
matter
with
him
leslie
seemed
much
excited
by
the
case
as
well
he
might
be
maitland
was
found
reeling
and
staggering
on
broadway
this
morning
continued
the
coroner
perhaps
the
policeman
was
not
really
at
fault
at
first
for
arresting
him
but
before
the
wagon
came
maitland
was
speechless
and
absolutely
unable
to
move
a
muscle
leslie
paused
as
he
recited
the
strange
facts
then
resumed
his
eyes
reacted
all
right
he
seemed
to
want
to
speak
to
write
but
could
a
frothy
saliva
dribbled
from
his
mouth
but
he
could
not
frame
a
word
he
was
paralysed
and
his
breathing
was
peculiar
they
then
hurried
him
to
the
hospital
as
soon
as
they
could
but
it
was
of
no
use
kennedy
was
regarding
the
doctor
keenly
as
he
proceeded
leslie
paused
again
to
emphasise
what
he
was
about
to
say
here
is
another
strange
thing
it
may
or
may
not
be
of
importance
but
it
is
strange
nevertheless
before
maitland
died
they
sent
for
his
wife
he
was
still
conscious
when
she
reached
the
hospital
could
recognise
her
seemed
to
want
to
speak
but
could
neither
talk
nor
move
it
was
pathetic
she
was
of
course
but
she
did
not
faint
she
is
not
of
the
fainting
kind
it
was
what
she
said
that
impressed
everyone
knew
it
i
knew
it
she
cried
she
had
dropped
on
her
knees
by
the
side
of
the
bed
felt
it
only
the
other
night
i
had
the
horrible
dream
i
saw
him
in
a
terrific
struggle
i
could
not
see
what
it
was
it
seemed
to
be
an
invisible
thing
i
ran
to
him
then
the
scene
shifted
i
saw
a
funeral
procession
and
in
the
casket
i
could
see
through
the
wood
his
face
oh
it
was
a
warning
it
has
come
true
i
feared
it
even
though
i
knew
it
was
only
a
dream
often
i
have
had
the
dream
of
that
funeral
procession
and
always
i
saw
the
same
face
his
face
oh
it
is
horrible
terrible
it
was
evident
that
leslie
at
least
was
impressed
by
the
dream
what
have
you
done
since
asked
craig
i
have
turned
loose
everyone
i
could
find
available
replied
leslie
handing
over
a
sheaf
of
reports
kennedy
glanced
keenly
over
them
as
they
lay
spread
out
on
the
table
i
should
like
to
see
the
body
he
said
at
length
it
was
lying
in
the
next
room
awaiting
leslie
permission
to
be
removed
at
first
explained
the
doctor
leading
the
way
we
thought
it
might
be
a
case
of
drops
chloral
you
know
or
perhaps
chloral
and
whiskey
a
combination
which
might
unite
to
make
chloroform
in
the
blood
but
no
we
have
tested
for
everything
we
can
think
of
in
fact
there
seems
to
be
no
trace
of
a
drug
present
it
is
inexplicable
if
maitland
really
committed
suicide
he
must
have
taken
something
and
as
far
as
we
can
find
out
there
is
no
trace
of
anything
as
far
as
we
have
gone
we
have
always
been
forced
back
to
the
original
idea
that
it
was
a
natural
death
perhaps
due
to
shock
of
some
kind
or
organic
weakness
kennedy
had
thoughtfully
raised
one
of
the
lifeless
hands
and
was
examining
it
not
that
he
corrected
even
if
the
autopsy
shows
nothing
it
does
prove
that
it
was
a
natural
death
look
on
the
back
of
the
hand
was
a
tiny
red
swollen
mark
leslie
regarded
it
with
lips
as
though
not
knowing
whether
it
was
significant
or
not
the
tissues
seemed
to
be
thickly
infiltrated
with
a
reddish
serum
and
the
congested
he
remarked
slowly
there
was
a
frothy
mucus
in
the
bronchial
tubes
the
blood
was
liquid
dark
and
clot
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
autopsical
research
revealed
absolutely
nothing
but
a
general
disorganisation
of
the
a
most
peculiar
thing
but
one
the
significance
of
which
none
of
us
here
can
fathom
if
it
was
poison
that
he
took
or
that
had
been
given
to
him
it
was
the
most
subtle
intangible
elusive
that
ever
came
to
my
knowledge
why
there
is
absolutely
no
trace
or
clue
nor
any
use
in
looking
for
one
in
that
way
broke
in
kennedy
decisively
if
we
are
to
make
any
progress
in
this
case
we
must
look
elsewhere
than
to
an
autopsy
there
is
no
clue
beyond
what
you
have
found
if
i
am
right
and
i
think
i
am
right
it
was
the
venom
of
the
cobra
cobra
venom
repeated
the
coroner
glancing
up
at
a
row
of
technical
works
yes
no
it
no
use
trying
to
look
it
up
there
is
no
way
of
verifying
a
case
of
cobra
poisoning
except
by
the
symptoms
it
is
not
like
any
other
poisoning
in
the
world
leslie
and
i
looked
at
each
other
aghast
at
the
thought
of
a
poison
so
subtle
that
it
defied
detection
you
think
he
was
bitten
by
a
snake
i
blurted
out
half
incredulous
oh
walter
on
broadway
no
of
course
not
but
cobra
venom
has
a
medicinal
value
it
is
sent
here
in
small
quantities
for
various
medicinal
purposes
then
too
it
would
be
easy
to
use
it
a
scratch
on
the
hand
in
the
passing
crowd
a
quick
shoving
of
the
letter
into
the
pocket
of
the
victim
and
the
murderer
would
probably
think
to
go
undetected
we
stood
dismayed
at
the
horror
of
such
a
scientific
murder
and
the
meagreness
of
the
materials
to
work
on
in
tracing
it
out
that
dream
was
indeed
peculiar
ruminated
craig
before
we
had
really
grasped
the
import
of
his
quick
revelation
you
do
mean
to
say
that
you
attach
any
importance
to
a
dream
i
asked
hurriedly
trying
to
follow
him
kennedy
merely
shrugged
his
shoulders
but
i
could
see
plainly
enough
that
he
did
you
have
given
this
letter
out
to
the
press
he
asked
not
yet
answered
leslie
then
do
until
i
say
to
do
so
i
shall
need
to
keep
it
the
cab
in
which
we
had
come
to
the
hospital
was
still
waiting
we
must
see
maitland
first
said
kennedy
as
we
left
the
nonplused
coroner
and
his
assistants
the
maitlands
lived
we
soon
found
in
a
large
brownstone
house
just
off
fifth
avenue
kennedy
card
with
the
message
that
it
was
very
urgent
brought
us
in
as
far
as
the
library
where
we
sat
for
a
moment
looking
around
at
the
quiet
refinement
of
a
more
than
home
on
a
desk
at
one
end
of
the
long
room
was
a
typewriter
kennedy
rose
there
was
not
a
sound
of
any
one
in
either
the
hallway
or
the
adjoining
rooms
a
moment
later
he
was
bending
quietly
over
the
typewriter
in
the
corner
running
off
a
series
of
characters
on
a
sheet
of
paper
a
sound
of
a
closing
door
upstairs
and
he
quickly
jammed
the
paper
into
his
pocket
retraced
his
steps
and
was
sitting
quietly
opposite
me
again
maitland
was
a
tall
perfectly
formed
woman
of
baffling
age
but
with
the
impression
of
both
youth
and
maturity
which
was
very
fascinating
she
was
calmer
now
and
although
she
seemed
to
be
of
anything
but
a
hysterical
nature
it
was
quite
evident
that
her
nervousness
was
due
to
much
more
than
the
shock
of
the
recent
tragic
event
great
as
that
must
have
been
it
may
have
been
that
i
recalled
the
words
of
the
note
ross
has
told
me
the
nature
of
your
illness
but
i
fancied
that
she
had
been
suffering
from
some
nervous
trouble
there
is
no
use
prolonging
our
introduction
maitland
began
kennedy
we
have
called
because
the
authorities
are
not
yet
fully
convinced
that
maitland
committed
suicide
it
was
evident
that
she
had
seen
the
note
at
least
not
a
suicide
she
repeated
looking
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
masterson
on
the
wire
whispered
a
maid
do
you
wish
to
speak
to
him
he
begged
to
say
that
he
did
not
wish
to
intrude
but
he
felt
that
if
there
yes
i
will
talk
to
him
in
my
room
she
interrupted
i
thought
that
there
was
just
a
trace
of
confusion
as
she
excused
herself
we
rose
kennedy
did
not
resume
his
seat
immediately
without
a
word
or
look
he
completed
his
work
at
the
typewriter
by
abstracting
several
blank
sheets
of
paper
from
the
desk
a
few
moments
later
maitland
returned
calmer
in
his
note
resumed
kennedy
he
spoke
of
ross
and
oh
she
cried
ca
you
see
ross
about
it
really
i
i
to
be
questioned
in
this
way
not
now
so
soon
after
what
i
had
to
go
through
it
seemed
that
her
nerves
were
getting
unstrung
again
kennedy
rose
to
go
later
come
to
see
me
she
pleaded
but
now
you
must
realise
it
is
too
much
i
can
not
talk
i
can
not
maitland
had
no
enemies
that
you
know
of
asked
kennedy
determined
to
learn
something
now
at
least
no
no
none
that
would
do
that
you
had
had
no
quarrel
he
added
no
we
never
quarrelled
oh
price
why
did
you
how
could
you
her
feelings
were
apparently
rapidly
getting
the
better
of
her
kennedy
bowed
and
we
withdrew
silently
he
had
learned
one
thing
she
believed
or
wanted
others
to
believe
in
the
note
at
a
public
telephone
a
few
minutes
later
kennedy
was
running
over
the
names
in
the
telephone
book
let
me
see
here
an
arnold
masterson
he
considered
then
turning
the
pages
he
went
on
now
we
must
find
this
ross
there
sheldon
ross
specialist
in
nerve
diseases
that
must
be
the
one
he
lives
only
a
few
blocks
further
uptown
handsome
well
built
tall
dignified
in
fact
distinguished
ross
proved
to
be
a
man
whose
very
face
and
manner
were
magnetic
as
should
be
those
of
one
who
had
chosen
his
branch
of
the
profession
you
have
heard
i
suppose
of
the
strange
death
of
price
maitland
began
kennedy
when
we
were
seated
in
the
doctor
office
yes
about
an
hour
ago
it
was
evident
that
he
was
studying
us
maitland
i
believe
is
a
patient
of
yours
yes
maitland
is
one
of
my
patients
he
admitted
interrogatively
then
as
if
considering
that
kennedy
manner
was
not
to
be
mollified
by
anything
short
of
a
show
of
confidence
he
added
she
came
to
me
several
months
ago
i
have
had
her
under
treatment
for
nervous
trouble
since
then
without
a
marked
improvement
and
maitland
asked
kennedy
was
he
a
patient
too
maitland
admitted
the
doctor
with
some
reticence
had
called
on
me
this
morning
but
no
he
was
not
a
patient
did
you
notice
anything
unusual
he
seemed
to
be
much
worried
ross
replied
guardedly
kennedy
took
the
suicide
note
from
his
pocket
and
handed
it
to
him
i
suppose
you
have
heard
of
this
asked
craig
the
doctor
read
it
hastily
then
looked
up
as
if
measuring
from
kennedy
manner
just
how
much
he
knew
as
nearly
as
i
could
make
out
he
said
slowly
his
reticence
to
outward
appearance
gone
maitland
seemed
to
have
something
on
his
mind
he
came
inquiring
as
to
the
real
cause
of
his
wife
nervousness
before
i
had
talked
to
him
long
i
gathered
that
he
had
a
haunting
fear
that
she
did
not
love
him
any
more
if
ever
i
fancied
that
he
even
doubted
her
fidelity
i
wondered
why
the
doctor
was
talking
so
freely
now
in
contrast
with
his
former
secretiveness
do
you
think
he
was
right
shot
out
kennedy
quickly
eying
ross
keenly
no
emphatically
no
he
was
not
right
replied
the
doctor
meeting
craig
scrutiny
without
flinching
maitland
he
went
on
more
slowly
as
if
carefully
weighing
every
word
belongs
to
a
large
and
growing
class
of
women
in
whom
to
speak
frankly
sex
seems
to
be
suppressed
she
is
a
very
handsome
and
attractive
woman
you
have
seen
her
yes
you
must
have
noticed
though
that
she
is
really
frigid
cold
intellectual
the
doctor
was
so
sharp
and
positive
about
his
first
statement
and
so
careful
in
phrasing
the
second
that
i
at
least
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
maitland
might
have
been
right
after
all
i
imagined
that
kennedy
too
had
his
suspicions
of
the
doctor
have
you
ever
heard
of
or
used
cobra
venom
in
any
of
your
medical
work
he
asked
casually
ross
wheeled
in
his
chair
surprised
why
yes
he
replied
quickly
you
know
that
it
is
a
test
for
blood
diseases
one
of
the
most
recently
discovered
and
used
parallel
to
the
old
tests
it
is
known
as
the
weil
test
do
you
use
it
often
n
no
he
replied
my
practice
ordinarily
does
not
lie
in
that
direction
i
used
it
not
long
ago
once
though
i
have
a
patient
under
my
care
a
he
came
to
me
originally
arnold
masterson
asked
craig
yes
how
did
you
know
his
name
guessed
it
replied
craig
laconically
as
if
he
knew
much
more
than
he
cared
to
tell
he
was
a
friend
of
maitland
was
he
not
i
should
say
not
replied
ross
without
hesitation
he
was
quite
ready
to
talk
without
being
urged
ordinarily
he
explained
confidentially
professional
ethics
seals
my
lips
but
in
this
instance
since
you
seem
to
know
so
much
i
may
as
well
tell
more
i
hardly
knew
whether
to
take
him
at
his
face
value
or
not
still
he
went
on
maitland
is
as
i
have
hinted
at
what
we
specialists
would
call
a
consciously
frigid
but
unconsciously
passionate
woman
as
an
intellectual
woman
she
suppresses
nature
but
nature
does
and
will
assert
herself
we
believe
often
you
will
find
an
intellectual
woman
attracted
unreasonably
to
a
purely
physical
man
i
mean
speaking
generally
not
in
particular
cases
you
have
read
ellen
key
i
presume
well
she
expresses
it
well
in
some
of
the
things
she
has
written
about
affinities
now
do
misunderstand
me
he
cautioned
i
am
speaking
generally
not
of
this
individual
case
i
was
following
ross
closely
when
he
talked
so
he
was
a
most
fascinating
man
maitland
he
resumed
has
been
much
troubled
by
her
dreams
as
you
have
heard
doubtless
the
other
day
she
told
me
of
another
dream
in
it
she
seemed
to
be
attacked
by
a
bull
which
suddenly
changed
into
a
serpent
i
may
say
that
i
had
asked
her
to
make
a
record
of
her
dreams
as
well
as
other
data
which
i
thought
might
be
of
use
in
the
study
and
treatment
of
her
nervous
troubles
i
readily
surmised
that
not
the
dream
but
something
else
perhaps
some
recollection
which
it
recalled
worried
her
by
careful
questioning
i
discovered
that
it
was
a
broken
engagement
yes
prompted
kennedy
the
she
admitted
had
a
face
the
face
of
arnold
masterson
was
ross
desperately
shifting
suspicion
from
himself
i
asked
very
strange
very
ruminated
kennedy
that
reminds
me
again
i
wonder
if
you
could
let
me
have
a
sample
of
this
cobra
venom
surely
excuse
me
i
get
you
some
the
doctor
had
scarcely
shut
the
door
when
kennedy
began
prowling
around
quietly
in
the
which
was
now
deserted
stood
a
typewriter
quickly
craig
ran
over
the
keys
of
the
machine
until
he
had
a
sample
of
every
character
then
he
reached
into
drawer
of
the
desk
and
hastily
stuffed
several
blank
sheets
of
paper
into
his
pocket
of
course
i
need
hardly
caution
you
in
handling
this
remarked
ross
as
he
returned
you
are
as
well
acquainted
as
i
am
with
the
danger
attending
its
careless
and
unscientific
uses
i
am
and
i
thank
you
very
much
said
kennedy
we
were
standing
in
the
you
will
keep
me
advised
of
any
progress
you
make
in
the
case
the
doctor
asked
it
complicates
as
you
can
well
imagine
my
treatment
of
mrs
maitland
i
shall
be
glad
to
do
so
replied
kennedy
as
we
departed
an
hour
later
found
us
in
a
handsomely
appointed
bachelor
apartment
in
a
fashionable
hotel
overlooking
the
lower
entrance
to
the
park
masterson
i
believe
inquired
kennedy
as
a
slim
debonair
man
entered
the
room
in
which
we
had
been
waiting
i
am
that
same
he
smiled
to
what
am
i
indebted
for
this
pleasure
we
had
been
gazing
at
the
various
curios
with
which
he
had
made
the
room
a
veritable
den
of
the
connoisseur
you
have
evidently
travelled
considerably
remarked
kennedy
avoiding
the
question
for
the
time
yes
i
have
been
back
in
this
country
only
a
few
weeks
masterson
replied
awaiting
the
answer
to
the
first
question
i
called
proceeded
kennedy
in
the
hope
that
you
masterson
might
be
able
to
shed
some
light
on
the
rather
peculiar
case
of
maitland
of
whose
death
i
suppose
you
have
already
heard
i
you
have
known
maitland
a
long
time
ignored
kennedy
we
went
to
school
together
and
were
engaged
were
you
not
masterson
looked
at
kennedy
in
surprise
yes
but
how
did
you
know
that
it
was
a
secret
only
between
us
two
i
thought
she
broke
it
off
not
i
she
broke
off
the
engagement
prompted
kennedy
yes
a
story
about
an
escapade
of
mine
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
you
know
but
by
jove
i
like
your
nerve
sir
masterson
frowned
then
added
i
prefer
not
to
talk
of
that
there
are
some
incidents
in
a
man
life
particularly
where
a
woman
is
concerned
that
are
forbidden
oh
i
beg
pardon
hastened
kennedy
but
by
the
way
you
would
have
no
objection
to
making
a
statement
regarding
your
trip
abroad
and
your
recent
return
to
this
country
subsequent
to
ah
the
incident
which
we
will
not
refer
to
none
whatever
i
left
new
york
in
disgusted
with
everything
in
general
and
life
here
in
particular
would
you
object
to
jotting
it
down
so
that
i
can
get
it
straight
asked
kennedy
just
a
brief
resume
you
know
no
have
you
a
pen
or
a
pencil
i
think
you
might
as
well
dictate
it
it
will
take
only
a
minute
to
run
it
off
on
the
typewriter
masterson
rang
the
bell
a
young
man
appeared
noiselessly
wix
he
said
take
this
left
new
york
in
travelling
on
the
continent
mostly
in
paris
vienna
and
rome
latterly
i
have
lived
in
london
until
six
weeks
ago
when
i
returned
to
new
york
will
that
serve
yes
perfectly
said
kennedy
as
he
folded
up
the
sheet
of
paper
which
the
young
secretary
handed
to
him
thank
you
i
trust
you
consider
it
an
impertinence
if
i
ask
you
whether
you
were
aware
that
ross
was
maitland
physician
of
course
i
knew
it
masterson
replied
frankly
i
have
given
him
up
for
that
reason
although
he
does
not
know
it
yet
i
most
strenuously
object
to
being
the
subject
of
what
shall
i
call
it
his
mental
vivisection
do
you
think
he
oversteps
his
position
in
trying
to
learn
of
the
mental
life
of
his
patients
queried
craig
i
would
rather
say
nothing
further
on
that
either
replied
masterson
i
was
talking
over
the
wire
to
maitland
a
few
moments
ago
giving
her
my
condolences
and
asking
if
there
was
anything
i
could
do
for
her
immediately
just
as
i
would
have
done
in
the
old
days
only
then
of
course
i
should
have
gone
to
her
directly
the
reason
i
did
not
go
but
telephoned
was
because
this
ross
seems
to
have
put
some
ridiculous
notions
into
her
head
about
me
now
look
here
i
do
want
to
discuss
this
i
told
you
more
than
i
intended
anyway
masterson
had
risen
his
suavity
masked
a
final
determination
to
say
no
more
ii
the
soul
analysis
the
day
was
far
advanced
after
this
series
of
very
unsatisfactory
interviews
i
looked
at
kennedy
blankly
we
seemed
to
have
uncovered
so
little
that
was
tangible
that
i
was
much
surprised
to
find
that
apparently
he
was
well
contented
with
what
had
happened
in
the
case
so
far
i
shall
be
busy
for
a
few
hours
in
the
laboratory
walter
he
remarked
as
we
parted
at
the
subway
i
think
if
you
have
nothing
better
to
do
that
you
might
employ
the
time
in
looking
up
some
of
the
gossip
about
maitland
and
masterson
to
say
nothing
of
ross
he
emphasised
drop
in
after
dinner
there
was
not
much
that
i
could
find
of
maitland
there
was
practically
nothing
that
i
already
did
not
know
from
having
seen
her
name
in
the
papers
she
was
a
leader
in
a
certain
set
which
was
devoting
its
activities
to
various
social
and
moral
propaganda
masterson
early
escapades
were
notorious
even
in
the
younger
smart
set
in
which
he
had
moved
but
his
years
abroad
had
mellowed
the
recollection
of
them
he
had
not
distinguished
himself
in
any
way
since
his
return
to
set
gossip
afloat
nor
had
any
tales
of
his
doings
abroad
filtered
through
to
new
york
clubland
ross
i
found
to
my
surprise
was
rather
better
known
than
i
had
supposed
both
as
a
specialist
and
as
a
man
about
town
he
seemed
to
have
risen
rapidly
in
his
profession
as
physician
to
the
ills
of
society
nerves
i
was
amazed
after
dinner
to
find
kennedy
doing
nothing
at
all
what
the
matter
i
asked
have
you
struck
a
snag
no
he
replied
slowly
i
was
only
waiting
i
told
them
to
be
here
between
eight
and
nine
who
i
queried
leslie
he
answered
he
has
the
authority
to
compel
the
attendance
of
maitland
ross
and
masterson
the
quickness
with
which
he
had
worked
out
a
case
which
was
to
me
one
of
the
most
inexplicable
he
had
had
for
a
long
time
left
me
standing
speechless
one
by
one
they
dropped
in
during
the
next
and
as
usual
it
fell
to
me
to
receive
them
and
smooth
over
the
rough
edges
which
always
obtruded
at
these
little
enforced
parties
in
the
laboratory
leslie
and
ross
were
the
first
to
arrive
they
had
not
come
together
but
had
met
at
the
door
i
fancied
i
saw
a
touch
of
professional
jealousy
in
their
manner
at
least
on
the
part
of
ross
masterson
came
as
usual
ignoring
the
seriousness
of
the
matter
and
accusing
us
all
of
conspiring
to
keep
him
from
the
first
night
of
a
light
opera
which
was
opening
maitland
followed
the
unaccustomed
pallor
of
her
face
heightened
by
the
plain
black
dress
i
felt
most
uncomfortable
as
indeed
i
think
the
rest
did
she
merely
inclined
her
head
to
masterson
seemed
almost
to
avoid
the
eye
of
ross
glared
at
leslie
and
absolutely
ignored
me
craig
had
been
standing
aloof
at
his
laboratory
table
beyond
a
nod
of
recognition
paying
little
attention
to
anything
he
seemed
to
be
in
no
hurry
to
begin
great
as
science
is
he
commenced
at
length
it
is
yet
far
removed
from
perfection
there
are
for
instance
substances
so
mysterious
subtle
and
dangerous
as
to
set
the
most
delicate
tests
and
powerful
lenses
at
naught
while
they
carry
death
most
horrible
in
their
train
he
could
scarcely
have
chosen
his
opening
words
with
more
effect
chief
among
them
he
proceeded
are
those
from
nature
own
laboratory
there
are
some
sixty
species
of
serpents
for
example
with
deadly
venom
among
these
as
you
doubtless
have
all
heard
none
has
brought
greater
terror
to
mankind
than
the
the
naja
tripudians
of
india
it
is
unnecessary
for
me
to
describe
the
cobra
or
to
say
anything
about
the
countless
thousands
who
have
yielded
up
their
lives
to
it
i
have
here
a
small
quantity
of
the
venom
he
indicated
it
in
a
glass
beaker
it
was
obtained
in
new
york
and
i
have
tested
it
on
it
has
lost
none
of
its
potency
i
fancied
that
there
was
a
feeling
of
relief
when
kennedy
by
his
actions
indicated
that
he
was
not
going
to
repeat
the
test
this
venom
he
continued
dries
in
the
air
into
a
substance
like
small
scales
soluble
in
water
but
not
in
alcohol
it
has
only
a
slightly
acrid
taste
and
odour
and
strange
to
say
is
inoffensive
on
the
tongue
or
mucous
surfaces
even
in
considerable
quantities
all
we
know
about
it
is
that
in
an
open
wound
it
is
deadly
swift
in
action
it
was
difficult
to
sit
unmoved
at
the
thought
that
before
us
in
only
a
few
grains
of
the
stuff
was
enough
to
kill
us
all
if
it
were
introduced
into
a
scratch
of
our
skin
until
recently
chemistry
was
powerless
to
solve
the
enigma
the
microscope
to
detect
its
presence
or
pathology
to
explain
the
reason
for
its
deadly
effect
and
even
now
about
all
we
know
is
that
autopsical
research
reveals
absolutely
nothing
but
the
general
disorganisation
of
the
blood
corpuscles
in
fact
such
poisoning
is
best
known
by
the
peculiar
symptoms
the
vertigo
weak
legs
and
falling
jaw
the
victim
is
unable
to
speak
or
swallow
but
is
fully
sensible
he
has
nausea
paralysis
an
accelerated
pulse
at
first
followed
rapidly
by
a
weakening
with
breath
slow
and
laboured
the
pupils
are
contracted
but
react
to
the
last
and
he
dies
in
convulsions
like
asphyxia
it
is
both
a
blood
and
a
nerve
poison
as
kennedy
proceeded
maitland
never
took
her
large
eyes
from
his
face
kennedy
now
drew
from
a
large
envelope
in
which
he
protected
it
the
typewritten
note
which
had
been
found
on
maitland
he
said
nothing
about
the
suicide
as
he
quietly
began
a
new
line
of
accumulating
evidence
there
is
an
increasing
use
of
the
typewriting
machine
for
the
production
of
spurious
papers
he
began
rattling
the
note
significantly
it
is
partly
due
to
the
great
increase
in
the
use
of
the
typewriter
generally
but
more
than
all
is
it
due
to
the
erroneous
idea
that
fraudulent
typewriting
can
not
be
detected
the
fact
is
that
the
typewriter
is
perhaps
a
worse
means
of
concealing
identity
than
is
disguised
handwriting
it
does
not
afford
the
effective
protection
to
the
criminal
that
is
supposed
on
the
contrary
the
typewriting
of
a
fraudulent
document
may
be
the
direct
means
by
which
it
can
be
traced
to
its
source
first
we
have
to
determine
what
kind
of
machine
a
certain
piece
of
writing
was
done
with
then
what
particular
machine
he
paused
and
indicated
a
number
of
little
instruments
on
the
table
for
example
he
resumed
the
lovibond
tintometer
tells
me
its
story
of
the
colour
of
the
ink
used
in
the
ribbon
of
the
machine
that
wrote
this
note
as
well
as
several
standard
specimens
which
i
have
been
able
to
obtain
from
three
machines
on
which
it
might
have
been
written
that
leads
me
to
speak
of
the
quality
of
the
paper
in
this
that
was
found
on
maitland
sometimes
such
a
may
be
mated
with
the
other
half
from
which
it
was
torn
as
accurately
as
if
the
act
were
performed
before
your
eyes
there
was
no
such
good
fortune
in
this
case
but
by
measurements
made
by
the
vernier
micrometer
caliper
i
have
found
the
precise
thickness
of
several
samples
of
paper
as
compared
to
that
of
the
suicide
note
i
need
hardly
add
that
in
thickness
and
quality
as
well
as
in
the
tint
of
the
ribbon
the
note
points
to
person
as
the
author
no
one
moved
and
there
are
other
proofs
unescapable
kennedy
hurried
on
for
instance
i
have
counted
the
number
of
threads
to
the
inch
in
the
ribbon
as
shown
by
the
letters
of
this
note
that
also
corresponds
to
the
number
in
one
of
the
three
ribbons
kennedy
laid
down
a
glass
plate
peculiarly
ruled
in
little
squares
this
he
explained
is
an
alignment
test
plate
through
which
can
be
studied
accurately
the
spacing
and
alignment
of
typewritten
characters
there
are
in
this
pica
type
ten
to
the
inch
horizontally
and
six
to
the
inch
vertically
that
is
usual
perhaps
you
are
not
acquainted
with
the
fact
that
typewritten
characters
are
in
line
both
ways
horizontally
and
vertically
there
are
nine
possible
positions
for
each
character
which
may
be
assumed
with
reference
to
one
of
these
little
standard
squares
of
the
test
plate
you
can
not
fail
to
appreciate
what
an
immense
impossibility
there
is
that
one
machine
should
duplicate
the
variations
out
of
the
true
which
the
microscope
detects
for
several
characters
on
another
not
only
that
but
the
faces
of
many
letters
inevitably
become
broken
worn
battered
as
well
as
out
of
alignment
or
slightly
shifted
in
their
position
on
the
type
bar
the
type
faces
are
not
flat
but
a
little
concave
to
conform
to
the
roller
there
are
thousands
of
possible
divergences
scars
and
deformities
in
each
machine
such
being
the
case
he
concluded
typewriting
has
an
individuality
like
that
of
the
bertillon
system
or
the
portrait
parle
he
paused
then
added
quickly
what
machine
was
it
in
this
case
i
have
samples
here
from
that
of
boss
from
a
machine
used
by
masterson
secretary
and
from
a
machine
which
was
accessible
to
both
and
mrs
maitland
kennedy
stopped
but
he
was
not
yet
prepared
to
relieve
the
suspense
of
two
of
those
whom
his
investigation
would
absolve
just
one
other
point
he
resumed
mercilessly
a
point
which
a
few
years
ago
would
have
been
inexplicable
if
not
positively
misleading
and
productive
of
actual
mistake
i
refer
to
the
dreams
of
mrs
maitland
i
had
been
expecting
it
yet
the
words
startled
me
what
must
they
have
done
to
her
but
she
kept
admirable
control
of
herself
dreams
used
to
be
treated
very
seriously
by
the
ancients
but
until
recently
modern
scientists
rejecting
the
ideas
of
the
dark
ages
have
scouted
dreams
however
we
study
them
scientifically
for
we
believe
that
whatever
is
has
a
reason
ross
i
think
is
acquainted
with
the
new
and
remarkable
theories
of
sigmund
freud
of
vienna
ross
nodded
i
dissent
vigorously
from
some
of
conclusions
he
hastened
let
me
state
them
first
resumed
craig
dreams
says
freud
are
very
important
they
give
us
the
most
reliable
information
concerning
the
individual
but
that
is
only
possible
kennedy
emphasised
the
point
if
the
patient
is
in
entire
rapport
with
the
doctor
now
the
dream
is
not
an
absurd
and
senseless
jumble
but
a
perfect
mechanism
and
has
a
definite
meaning
in
penetrating
the
mind
it
is
as
though
we
had
two
streams
of
thought
one
of
which
we
allow
to
flow
freely
the
other
of
which
we
are
constantly
repressing
pushing
back
into
the
subconscious
or
unconscious
this
matter
of
the
evolution
of
our
individual
mental
life
is
too
long
a
story
to
bore
you
with
at
such
a
critical
moment
but
the
resistances
the
psychic
censors
of
our
ideas
are
always
active
except
in
sleep
then
the
repressed
material
comes
to
the
surface
but
the
resistances
never
entirely
lose
their
power
and
the
dream
shows
the
material
distorted
seldom
does
one
recognise
his
own
repressed
thoughts
or
unattained
wishes
the
dream
really
is
the
guardian
of
sleep
to
satisfy
the
activity
of
the
unconscious
and
repressed
mental
processes
that
would
otherwise
disturb
sleep
by
keeping
the
censor
busy
in
the
case
of
a
nightmare
the
watchman
or
censor
is
aroused
finds
himself
overpowered
so
to
speak
and
calls
on
consciousness
for
help
there
are
three
kinds
of
dreams
those
which
represent
an
unrepressed
wish
as
fulfilled
those
that
represent
the
realisation
of
a
repressed
wish
in
an
entirely
concealed
form
and
those
that
represent
the
realisation
of
a
repressed
wish
in
a
form
insufficiently
or
only
partially
concealed
dreams
are
not
of
the
future
but
of
the
past
except
as
they
show
striving
for
unfulfilled
wishes
whatever
may
be
denied
in
reality
we
nevertheless
can
realise
in
another
way
in
our
dreams
and
probably
more
of
our
daily
life
conduct
moods
beliefs
than
we
think
could
be
traced
to
preceding
dreams
ross
was
listening
attentively
as
craig
turned
to
him
this
is
perhaps
the
part
of
freud
theory
from
which
you
dissent
most
strongly
freud
says
that
as
soon
as
you
enter
the
intimate
life
of
a
patient
you
begin
to
find
sex
in
some
form
in
fact
the
best
indication
of
abnormality
would
be
its
absence
sex
is
one
of
the
strongest
of
human
impulses
yet
the
one
subjected
to
the
greatest
repression
for
that
reason
it
is
the
weakest
point
in
our
cultural
development
in
a
normal
life
he
says
there
are
no
neuroses
let
me
proceed
now
with
what
the
freudists
call
the
psychanalysis
the
soul
analysis
of
mrs
maitland
it
was
startling
in
the
extreme
to
consider
the
possibilities
to
which
this
new
science
might
lead
as
he
proceeded
to
illustrate
it
maitland
he
continued
your
dream
of
fear
was
a
dream
of
what
we
call
the
fulfilment
of
a
suppressed
wish
moreover
fear
always
denotes
a
sexual
idea
underlying
the
dream
in
fact
morbid
anxiety
means
surely
unsatisfied
love
the
old
greeks
knew
it
the
gods
of
fear
were
born
of
the
goddess
of
love
consciously
you
feared
the
death
of
your
husband
because
unconsciously
you
wished
it
it
was
startling
dramatic
cruel
perhaps
merciless
this
dissecting
of
the
soul
of
the
handsome
woman
before
us
but
it
had
come
to
a
point
where
it
was
necessary
to
get
at
the
truth
maitland
hitherto
pale
was
now
flushed
and
indignant
yet
the
very
manner
of
her
indignation
showed
the
truth
of
the
new
psychology
of
dreams
for
as
i
learned
afterward
people
often
become
indignant
when
the
freudists
strike
what
is
called
the
main
complex
there
are
other
motives
just
as
important
protested
boss
here
in
america
the
money
motive
ambition
let
me
finish
interposed
kennedy
i
want
to
consider
the
other
dream
also
fear
is
equivalent
to
a
wish
in
this
sort
of
dream
it
also
as
i
have
said
denotes
sex
in
dreams
animals
are
usually
symbols
now
in
this
second
dream
we
find
both
the
bull
and
the
serpent
from
time
immemorial
symbols
of
the
continuing
of
the
dreams
are
always
based
on
experiences
or
thoughts
of
the
day
preceding
the
dreams
you
maitland
dreamed
of
a
man
face
on
these
beasts
there
was
every
chance
of
having
him
suggested
to
you
you
think
you
hate
him
consciously
you
reject
him
unconsciously
you
accept
him
any
of
the
new
psychologists
who
knows
the
intimate
connection
between
love
and
hate
would
understand
how
that
is
possible
love
does
not
extinguish
hate
or
hate
love
they
repress
each
other
the
opposite
sentiment
may
very
easily
grow
the
situation
was
growing
more
tense
as
he
proceeded
was
not
kennedy
actually
taxing
her
with
loving
another
the
dreamer
he
proceeded
remorselessly
is
always
the
principal
actor
in
a
dream
or
the
dream
centres
about
the
dreamer
most
intimately
dreams
are
personal
we
never
dream
about
matters
that
really
concern
others
but
ourselves
years
ago
he
continued
you
suffered
what
the
new
psychologists
call
a
trauma
a
you
were
engaged
but
your
censored
consciousness
rejected
the
manner
of
life
of
your
fiance
in
pique
you
married
price
maitland
but
you
never
lost
your
real
subconscious
love
for
another
he
stopped
then
added
in
a
low
tone
that
was
almost
inaudible
yet
which
did
not
call
for
an
answer
could
you
be
honest
with
yourself
for
you
need
say
not
a
word
aloud
could
you
always
be
sure
of
yourself
in
the
face
of
any
situation
she
looked
startled
her
ordinarily
inscrutable
face
betrayed
everything
though
it
was
averted
from
the
rest
of
us
and
could
be
seen
only
by
kennedy
she
knew
the
truth
that
she
strove
to
repress
she
was
afraid
of
herself
it
is
dangerous
she
murmured
to
be
with
a
person
who
pays
attention
to
such
little
things
if
every
one
were
like
you
i
would
no
longer
breathe
a
syllable
of
my
dreams
she
was
sobbing
now
what
was
back
of
it
all
i
had
heard
of
the
resolution
dreams
i
had
heard
of
dreams
that
kill
of
unconscious
murder
of
the
terrible
acts
of
the
subconscious
somnambulist
of
which
the
actor
has
no
recollection
in
the
waking
state
until
put
under
hypnotism
was
it
that
which
kennedy
was
driving
at
disclosing
ross
moved
nearer
to
maitland
as
if
to
reassure
her
craig
was
studying
attentively
the
effect
of
his
revelation
both
on
her
and
on
the
other
faces
before
him
maitland
her
shoulders
bent
with
the
outpouring
of
the
emotion
of
the
evening
and
of
the
tragic
day
called
for
sympathy
which
i
could
see
craig
would
readily
give
when
he
had
reached
the
climax
he
had
planned
kennedy
exclaimed
masterson
pushing
aside
ross
as
he
bounded
to
the
side
of
maitland
unable
to
restrain
himself
longer
kennedy
you
are
a
faker
nothing
but
a
damned
dream
doctor
in
scientific
disguise
perhaps
replied
craig
with
a
quiet
curl
of
the
lip
but
the
threads
of
the
typewriter
ribbon
the
alignment
of
the
letters
the
paper
all
the
of
that
note
of
suicide
were
those
of
the
machine
belonging
to
the
man
who
caused
the
who
knew
madeline
maitland
inmost
heart
better
than
herself
because
he
had
heard
of
freud
undoubtedly
when
he
was
in
vienna
who
knew
that
he
held
her
real
love
still
who
posed
as
a
patient
of
ross
to
learn
her
secrets
as
well
as
to
secure
the
subtle
poison
of
the
cobra
that
man
perhaps
merely
brushed
against
price
maitland
in
the
crowd
enough
to
scratch
his
hand
with
the
needle
shove
the
false
note
into
his
pocket
anything
to
win
the
woman
who
he
knew
loved
him
and
whom
he
could
win
masterson
you
are
that
man
the
next
half
hour
was
crowded
kaleidoscopically
with
events
the
call
by
leslie
for
the
police
the
departure
of
the
coroner
with
masterson
in
custody
and
the
efforts
of
ross
to
calm
his
now
almost
hysterical
patient
maitland
then
a
calm
seemed
to
settle
down
over
the
old
laboratory
which
had
so
often
been
the
scene
of
such
events
tense
with
human
interest
i
could
scarcely
conceal
my
amazement
as
i
watched
kennedy
quietly
restoring
to
their
places
the
pieces
of
apparatus
he
had
used
what
the
matter
he
asked
catching
my
eye
as
he
paused
with
the
tintometer
in
his
hand
why
i
exclaimed
that
a
fine
way
to
start
a
month
here
just
one
day
gone
and
you
caught
your
man
are
you
going
to
keep
that
up
if
you
are
i
quit
and
skip
to
february
i
choose
the
shortest
month
if
that
the
pace
any
month
you
please
he
smiled
grimly
as
he
reluctantly
placed
the
tintometer
in
its
cabinet
there
was
no
use
i
knew
that
any
other
month
would
have
been
just
the
same
well
i
replied
weakly
all
i
can
hope
is
that
every
day
wo
be
as
strenuous
as
this
has
been
i
hope
at
least
you
will
give
me
time
to
make
some
notes
before
you
start
off
again
ca
say
he
answered
still
busy
returning
paraphernalia
to
its
accustomed
place
i
have
no
control
over
the
cases
as
they
come
to
me
except
that
i
fan
turn
down
those
that
do
interest
me
then
i
sighed
wearily
turn
down
the
next
one
i
must
have
rest
i
going
home
to
sleep
very
well
he
said
making
no
move
to
follow
me
i
shook
my
head
doubtfully
it
was
impossible
to
force
a
card
on
kennedy
instead
of
showing
any
disposition
to
switch
off
the
laboratory
lights
he
appeared
to
be
regarding
a
row
of
with
the
abstraction
of
a
man
who
has
been
interrupted
in
the
midst
of
an
absorbing
occupation
good
night
i
said
at
length
good
night
he
echoed
mechanically
i
know
that
he
slept
that
night
at
least
his
bed
had
been
slept
in
when
i
awoke
in
the
morning
but
he
was
gone
but
then
it
was
not
unusual
for
him
when
the
fever
for
work
was
on
him
to
consider
even
five
or
fewer
hours
a
night
rest
it
made
no
difference
when
i
argued
with
him
the
fact
that
he
thrived
on
it
himself
and
could
justify
it
by
pointing
to
other
scientists
was
refutation
enough
slowly
i
dressed
breakfasted
and
began
transcribing
what
i
could
from
the
hastily
jotted
down
notes
of
the
day
before
i
knew
that
the
work
whatever
it
was
in
which
he
was
now
engaged
must
be
in
the
nature
of
research
dear
to
his
heart
otherwise
he
would
have
left
word
for
me
no
word
came
from
him
however
all
day
and
i
had
not
only
caught
up
in
my
notes
but
my
appetite
whetted
by
our
first
case
had
become
hungry
for
more
in
fact
i
had
begun
to
get
a
little
worried
at
the
continued
silence
a
hand
on
the
knob
of
the
door
or
a
ring
of
the
telephone
would
hare
been
a
welcome
relief
i
was
gradually
becoming
aware
of
the
fact
that
i
liked
the
excitement
of
the
life
as
much
as
kennedy
did
i
knew
it
when
the
sudden
sharp
tinkle
of
the
telephone
set
my
heart
throbbing
almost
as
quickly
as
the
little
bell
hammer
buzzed
jameson
for
heaven
sake
find
kennedy
immediately
and
bring
him
over
here
to
the
novella
beauty
parlour
we
got
the
worst
case
i
been
up
against
in
a
long
time
leslie
the
coroner
is
here
and
says
we
must
not
make
a
move
until
kennedy
arrives
i
doubt
whether
in
all
our
long
acquaintance
i
had
ever
heard
first
deputy
more
wildly
excited
and
apparently
more
helpless
than
he
seemed
over
the
telephone
that
night
what
is
it
i
asked
never
mind
never
mind
find
kennedy
he
called
back
almost
brusquely
it
miss
blanche
blaisdell
the
actress
she
been
found
dead
here
the
thing
is
an
absolute
mystery
now
get
him
get
him
it
was
still
early
in
the
evening
and
kennedy
had
not
come
in
nor
had
he
sent
any
word
to
our
apartment
had
already
tried
the
laboratory
as
for
myself
i
had
not
the
slightest
idea
where
craig
was
i
knew
the
case
must
be
urgent
if
both
the
deputy
and
the
coroner
were
waiting
for
him
still
after
half
an
hour
vigorous
telephoning
i
was
unable
to
find
a
trace
of
kennedy
in
any
of
his
usual
haunts
in
desperation
i
left
a
message
for
him
with
the
in
case
he
called
up
jumped
into
a
cab
and
rode
over
to
the
laboratory
hoping
that
some
of
the
might
still
be
about
and
might
know
something
of
his
whereabouts
the
janitor
was
able
to
enlighten
me
to
the
extent
of
telling
me
that
a
big
limousine
had
called
for
kennedy
an
hour
or
so
before
and
that
he
had
left
in
great
haste
i
had
given
it
up
as
hopeless
and
had
driven
back
to
the
apartment
to
wait
for
him
when
the
made
a
rush
at
me
just
as
i
was
paying
my
fare
kennedy
on
the
wire
sir
he
cried
as
he
half
dragged
me
into
the
hall
walter
almost
shouted
kennedy
i
over
at
the
washington
heights
hospital
with
barron
you
remember
barron
in
our
class
at
college
he
has
a
very
peculiar
case
of
a
poor
girl
whom
he
found
wandering
on
the
street
and
brought
here
most
unusual
thing
he
came
over
to
the
laboratory
after
me
in
his
car
yes
i
have
the
message
that
you
left
with
the
come
up
here
and
pick
me
up
and
we
ride
right
down
to
the
novella
goodbye
i
had
not
stopped
to
ask
questions
and
prolong
the
conversation
knowing
as
i
did
the
fuming
impatience
of
it
was
relief
enough
to
know
that
kennedy
was
located
at
last
he
was
in
the
psychopathic
ward
with
barron
as
i
hurried
in
the
girl
whom
he
had
mentioned
over
the
telephone
was
then
quietly
sleeping
under
the
influence
of
an
opiate
and
they
were
discussing
the
case
outside
in
the
hall
what
do
you
think
of
it
yourself
barron
was
asking
nodding
to
me
to
join
them
then
he
added
for
my
enlightenment
i
found
this
girl
wandering
bareheaded
in
the
street
to
tell
the
truth
i
thought
at
first
that
she
was
intoxicated
but
a
good
look
showed
me
better
than
that
so
i
hustled
the
poor
thing
into
my
car
and
brought
her
here
all
the
way
she
kept
crying
over
and
over
do
you
see
it
afire
her
lips
shine
they
shine
they
shine
i
think
the
girl
is
demented
and
has
had
some
hallucination
too
vivid
for
a
hallucination
remarked
kennedy
decisively
it
was
too
real
to
her
even
the
opiate
could
remove
the
picture
whatever
it
was
from
her
mind
until
you
had
given
her
almost
enough
to
kill
her
normally
no
that
was
any
hallucination
now
walter
ready
iii
the
sybarite
we
found
the
novella
beauty
parlour
on
the
top
floor
of
an
just
off
fifth
avenue
on
a
side
street
not
far
from
street
a
special
elevator
elaborately
fitted
up
wafted
us
up
with
express
speed
as
the
door
opened
we
saw
a
vista
of
lattices
little
gateways
hung
with
roses
windows
of
glass
get
in
white
wood
rooms
with
little
white
enamelled
and
chairs
amber
lights
glowing
with
soft
incandescence
in
deep
bowers
of
fireproof
tissue
flowers
there
was
a
delightful
warmth
about
the
place
and
the
seductive
scents
and
delicate
odours
betokened
the
haunt
of
the
sybarite
both
and
leslie
strangely
out
of
place
in
the
enervating
luxury
of
the
now
deserted
were
still
waiting
for
kennedy
with
a
grim
determination
a
most
peculiar
thing
whispered
dashing
forward
the
moment
the
elevator
door
opened
we
ca
seem
to
find
a
single
cause
for
her
death
the
people
up
here
say
it
was
a
suicide
but
i
never
accept
the
theory
of
suicide
unless
there
are
undoubted
proofs
so
far
there
have
been
none
in
this
case
there
was
no
reason
for
it
seated
in
one
of
the
large
of
the
in
a
corner
with
two
of
men
standing
watchfully
near
was
a
man
who
was
the
embodiment
of
all
that
was
nervous
he
was
alternately
wringing
his
hands
and
rumpling
his
hair
beside
him
was
a
lady
in
a
most
amazing
state
of
preservation
who
evidently
presided
over
the
cosmetic
mysteries
beyond
the
male
ken
she
was
so
perfectly
groomed
that
she
looked
as
though
her
clothes
were
a
mould
into
which
she
had
literally
been
poured
professor
and
madame
millefleur
otherwise
miller
whispered
noting
kennedy
questioning
gaze
and
taking
his
arm
to
hurry
him
down
a
long
softly
carpeted
corridor
flanked
on
either
side
by
little
doors
they
run
the
shop
they
say
one
of
the
girls
just
opened
the
door
and
found
her
dead
near
the
end
one
of
the
doors
stood
open
and
before
it
leslie
who
had
preceded
us
paused
he
motioned
to
us
to
look
in
it
was
a
little
containing
a
single
bed
a
dresser
and
a
mirror
but
it
was
not
the
scant
though
elegant
furniture
that
caused
us
to
start
back
there
under
the
dull
of
the
corridor
lay
a
woman
most
superbly
formed
she
was
dark
and
the
thick
masses
of
her
hair
ready
for
the
hairdresser
fell
in
a
tangle
over
her
beautifully
chiselled
features
and
full
rounded
shoulders
and
neck
a
scarlet
bathrobe
loosened
at
the
throat
actually
accentuated
rather
than
covered
the
voluptuous
lines
of
her
figure
down
to
the
slender
ankle
which
had
been
the
beginning
of
her
fortune
as
a
danseuse
except
for
the
marble
pallor
of
her
face
it
was
difficult
to
believe
that
she
was
not
sleeping
and
yet
there
she
was
the
famous
blanche
blaisdell
dead
dead
in
the
little
of
the
novella
beauty
parlour
surrounded
as
in
life
by
mystery
and
luxury
we
stood
for
several
moments
speechless
stupefied
at
last
silently
drew
a
letter
from
his
pocket
it
was
written
on
the
latest
and
most
delicate
of
scented
stationery
it
was
lying
sealed
on
the
dresser
when
we
arrived
explained
holding
it
so
that
we
could
not
see
the
address
i
thought
at
first
she
had
really
committed
suicide
and
that
this
was
a
note
of
explanation
but
it
is
not
listen
it
is
just
a
line
or
two
it
reads
feeling
better
now
though
that
was
a
great
party
last
night
thanks
for
the
newspaper
puff
which
i
have
just
read
it
was
very
kind
of
you
to
get
them
to
print
it
meet
me
at
the
same
place
and
same
time
your
blanche
the
note
was
not
stamped
and
was
never
sent
perhaps
she
rang
for
a
messenger
at
any
rate
she
must
have
been
dead
before
she
could
send
it
but
it
was
addressed
to
burke
collins
burke
collins
exclaimed
kennedy
and
i
together
in
amazement
he
was
one
of
the
leading
corporation
lawyers
in
the
country
director
in
a
score
of
the
largest
companies
officer
in
half
a
dozen
charities
and
social
organisations
patron
of
art
and
opera
it
seemed
impossible
and
i
at
least
did
not
hesitate
to
say
so
for
answer
simply
laid
the
letter
and
envelope
down
on
the
dresser
it
seemed
to
take
some
time
to
convince
kennedy
there
it
was
in
black
and
white
however
in
blanche
blaisdell
own
vertical
hand
try
to
figure
it
out
as
i
could
there
seemed
to
be
only
one
conclusion
and
that
was
to
accept
it
what
it
was
that
interested
him
i
did
not
know
but
finally
he
bent
down
and
sniffed
not
at
the
scented
letter
but
at
the
covering
on
the
dresser
when
he
raised
his
head
i
saw
that
he
had
not
been
looking
at
the
letter
at
all
but
at
a
spot
on
the
cover
near
it
he
sniffed
thoughtfully
closing
his
eyes
as
if
considering
something
yes
oil
of
turpentine
suddenly
he
opened
his
eyes
and
the
blank
look
of
abstraction
that
had
masked
his
face
was
broken
through
by
a
gleam
of
comprehension
that
i
knew
flashed
the
truth
to
him
intuitively
turn
out
that
light
in
the
corridor
he
ordered
quickly
leslie
found
and
turned
the
switch
there
we
were
alone
in
the
now
weird
little
alone
with
that
horribly
lovely
thing
lying
there
cold
and
motionless
on
the
little
white
bed
kennedy
moved
forward
in
the
darkness
gently
almost
as
if
she
were
still
the
living
pulsing
sentient
blanche
blaisdell
who
had
entranced
thousands
he
opened
her
mouth
a
cry
from
who
was
standing
in
front
of
me
followed
that
those
little
spots
on
her
tongue
and
throat
they
glow
it
is
the
corpse
light
surely
enough
there
were
little
luminous
spots
in
her
mouth
i
had
heard
somewhere
that
there
is
a
phosphorescence
appearing
during
decay
of
organic
substances
which
once
gave
rise
to
the
ancient
superstition
of
corpse
lights
and
the
it
was
really
due
i
knew
to
living
bacteria
but
there
surely
had
been
no
time
for
such
to
develop
even
in
the
almost
tropic
heat
of
the
novella
could
she
have
been
poisoned
by
these
phosphorescent
bacilli
what
was
it
a
strange
new
that
had
attacked
this
notorious
adventuress
and
woman
of
luxury
leslie
had
flashed
up
the
light
again
before
craig
spoke
we
were
all
watching
him
keenly
phosphorus
phosphoric
acid
or
phosphoric
salve
craig
said
slowly
looking
eagerly
about
the
room
as
if
in
search
of
something
that
would
explain
it
he
caught
sight
of
the
envelope
still
lying
on
the
dresser
he
picked
it
up
toyed
with
it
looked
at
the
top
where
had
slit
it
then
deliberately
tore
the
flap
off
the
back
where
it
had
been
glued
in
sealing
the
letter
put
the
light
out
again
he
asked
where
the
thin
line
of
gum
was
on
the
back
of
the
flap
in
the
darkness
there
glowed
the
same
sort
of
brightness
that
we
had
seen
in
a
speck
here
and
there
on
blanche
blaisdell
lips
and
in
her
mouth
the
truth
flashed
over
me
some
one
had
placed
the
stuff
whatever
it
was
on
the
flap
of
the
envelope
knowing
that
she
must
touch
her
lips
to
it
to
seal
it
she
had
done
so
and
the
deadly
poison
had
entered
her
mouth
as
the
light
went
up
again
kennedy
added
oil
of
turpentine
removes
traces
of
phosphorus
phosphoric
acid
or
phosphoric
salve
which
are
insoluble
in
anything
else
except
ether
and
absolute
alcohol
some
one
who
knew
that
tried
to
eradicate
them
but
did
not
wholly
succeed
see
if
you
can
find
either
phosphorus
the
oil
or
the
salve
anywhere
in
the
shop
then
as
and
leslie
hurriedly
disappeared
he
added
to
me
another
of
those
strange
coincidences
walter
you
remember
the
girl
at
the
hospital
do
you
see
it
she
afire
her
lips
shine
they
shine
they
shine
kennedy
was
still
looking
carefully
over
the
room
in
a
little
wicker
basket
was
a
newspaper
which
was
open
at
the
page
of
theatrical
news
and
as
i
glanced
quickly
at
it
i
saw
a
most
laudatory
paragraph
about
her
beneath
the
paper
were
some
torn
scraps
kennedy
picked
them
up
and
pieced
them
together
dearest
blanche
they
read
i
hope
feeling
better
after
that
dinner
last
night
can
you
meet
me
write
me
immediately
collie
he
placed
the
scraps
carefully
in
his
wallet
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
done
here
apparently
as
we
passed
down
the
corridor
we
could
hear
a
man
apparently
raving
in
good
english
and
bad
french
it
proved
to
be
millefleur
or
miller
and
his
raving
was
as
overdone
as
that
of
a
actor
madame
was
trying
to
calm
him
henri
henri
do
go
on
so
she
was
saying
a
suicide
in
the
novella
it
will
be
in
all
the
papers
we
shall
be
ruined
oh
oh
here
can
that
sob
stuff
broke
in
one
of
officers
you
can
tell
it
all
when
the
chief
takes
you
to
headquarters
see
certainly
the
man
made
no
very
favourable
impression
by
his
actions
there
seemed
to
be
much
that
was
forced
about
them
that
was
more
incriminating
than
a
stolid
silence
would
have
been
between
them
monsieur
and
madame
made
out
however
to
repeat
to
kennedy
their
version
of
what
had
happened
it
seemed
that
a
note
addressed
to
miss
blaisdell
had
been
left
by
some
one
on
the
desk
in
the
no
one
knew
who
left
it
but
one
of
the
girls
had
picked
it
up
and
delivered
it
to
her
in
her
a
moment
later
she
rang
her
bell
and
called
for
one
of
the
girls
named
agnes
who
was
to
dress
her
hair
agnes
was
busy
and
the
actress
asked
her
to
get
paper
a
pen
and
ink
at
least
it
seemed
that
way
for
agnes
got
them
for
her
a
few
minutes
later
her
bell
rang
again
and
agnes
went
down
apparently
to
tell
her
that
she
was
now
ready
to
dress
her
hair
the
next
thing
any
one
knew
was
a
piercing
shriek
from
the
girl
she
ran
down
the
corridor
still
shrieking
out
into
the
and
rushed
into
the
elevator
which
happened
to
be
up
at
the
time
that
was
the
last
they
had
seen
of
her
the
other
girls
saw
miss
blaisdell
lying
dead
and
a
panic
followed
the
customers
dressed
quickly
and
fled
almost
in
panic
all
was
confusion
by
that
time
a
policeman
had
arrived
and
soon
after
and
the
coroner
had
come
there
was
little
use
in
the
couple
they
had
evidently
had
time
to
agree
on
the
story
that
is
supposing
it
were
not
true
only
a
scientific
third
degree
could
have
shaken
them
and
such
a
thing
was
impossible
just
at
that
time
from
the
line
of
kennedy
questions
i
could
see
that
he
believed
that
there
was
a
hiatus
somewhere
in
their
glib
story
at
least
some
point
where
some
one
had
tried
to
eradicate
the
marks
of
the
poison
here
it
is
we
found
it
interrupted
holding
up
in
his
excitement
a
bottle
covered
with
black
cloth
to
protect
it
from
the
light
it
was
in
the
back
of
a
cabinet
in
the
and
it
is
marked
phosphore
another
of
oil
of
turpentine
was
on
a
shelf
in
another
cabinet
both
seem
to
have
been
used
lately
judging
by
the
wetness
of
the
bottoms
of
the
glass
stoppers
ether
phosphore
phosphorated
ether
commented
kennedy
reading
the
label
to
himself
a
remedy
from
the
french
codex
composed
if
i
remember
rightly
of
one
part
phosphorus
and
fifty
parts
sulphuric
ether
phosphorus
is
often
given
as
a
remedy
for
loss
of
nerve
power
neuralgia
hysteria
and
melancholia
in
quantities
from
a
fiftieth
to
a
tenth
or
so
of

phosphorus
is
a
renovator
of
nerve
tissue
and
nerve
force
a
drug
for
intense
and
anxiety
of
mind
and
protracted
emotional
excitement
in
short
for
fast
living
he
uncorked
the
bottle
and
we
tasted
the
stuff
it
was
unpleasant
and
nauseous
i
do
see
why
it
was
used
in
the
form
of
pills
the
liquid
form
of
a
few
drops
on
gum
arabic
is
hopelessly
antiquated
the
elevator
door
opened
with
a
clang
and
a
athletic
looking
man
of
middle
age
with
an
acquired
youngish
look
about
his
clothes
and
face
stepped
out
his
face
was
pale
and
his
hand
shook
with
emotion
that
showed
that
something
had
unstrung
his
usually
nerves
i
recognised
burke
collins
at
once
in
spite
of
his
nervousness
he
strode
forward
with
the
air
of
a
man
accustomed
to
being
obeyed
to
having
everything
done
for
him
merely
because
he
burke
collins
could
afford
to
pay
for
it
and
it
was
his
right
he
seemed
to
know
whom
he
was
seeking
for
he
immediately
singled
out
this
is
terrible
terrible
he
whispered
hoarsely
no
no
no
i
do
want
to
see
her
i
ca
not
yet
you
know
i
thought
the
world
of
that
poor
little
girl
only
and
here
the
innate
selfishness
of
the
man
cropped
out
only
i
called
to
ask
you
that
nothing
of
my
connection
with
her
be
given
out
you
understand
spare
nothing
to
get
at
the
truth
employ
the
best
men
you
have
get
outside
help
if
necessary
i
pay
for
anything
anything
perhaps
i
can
use
some
influence
for
you
some
day
too
but
you
understand
the
scandal
you
know
not
a
word
to
the
newspapers
at
another
time
i
feel
sure
that
would
have
succumbed
collins
was
not
without
a
great
deal
of
political
influence
and
even
a
first
deputy
may
be
broke
by
a
man
with
influence
but
now
here
was
kennedy
and
he
wished
to
appear
in
the
best
light
he
looked
at
craig
let
me
introduce
professor
kennedy
he
said
i
already
called
him
in
very
happy
to
have
the
pleasure
of
meeting
you
said
collins
grasping
kennedy
hand
warmly
i
hope
you
will
take
me
as
your
client
in
this
case
i
pay
handsomely
i
always
had
a
great
admiration
for
your
work
and
i
heard
a
great
deal
about
it
kennedy
is
if
anything
as
impervious
to
blandishment
as
a
stone
as
the
blarney
stone
is
itself
for
instance
on
one
condition
he
replied
slowly
and
that
is
that
i
go
ahead
exactly
as
if
i
were
employed
by
the
city
itself
to
get
at
the
truth
collins
bit
his
lip
it
was
evident
that
he
was
not
accustomed
to
being
met
in
this
independent
spirit
very
well
he
answered
at
last
has
called
you
in
work
for
him
and
well
you
know
if
you
need
anything
just
draw
on
me
for
it
only
if
you
can
keep
me
out
of
it
i
tell
everything
i
can
to
help
you
but
not
to
the
newspapers
he
beckoned
us
outside
those
people
in
there
he
nodded
his
head
back
in
the
direction
of
the
millefleurs
do
you
suspect
them
by
george
it
does
look
badly
for
them
does
it
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
well
now
you
see
i
frank
and
confidential
about
my
relations
with
blan
er
miss
blaisdell
i
was
at
a
big
dinner
with
her
last
night
with
a
party
of
friends
i
suppose
she
came
here
to
get
straightened
out
i
had
been
able
to
get
her
on
the
wire
but
at
the
theatre
when
i
called
up
they
told
me
what
had
happened
and
i
came
right
over
here
now
please
remember
do
everything
anything
but
create
a
scandal
you
realise
what
that
would
mean
for
me
kennedy
said
nothing
he
simply
laid
down
on
the
desk
piece
by
piece
the
torn
letter
which
he
had
picked
up
from
the
basket
and
beside
it
he
spread
out
the
reply
which
blanche
had
written
what
gasped
collins
as
he
read
the
torn
letter
i
send
that
why
man
alive
you
crazy
did
i
just
tell
you
i
had
heard
from
her
until
i
called
up
the
theatre
just
now
i
could
not
make
out
whether
he
was
lying
or
not
when
he
said
that
he
had
not
sent
the
note
kennedy
picked
up
a
pen
please
write
the
same
thing
as
you
read
in
the
note
on
this
sheet
of
the
novella
paper
it
will
be
all
right
you
have
plenty
of
witnesses
to
that
it
must
have
irked
collins
even
to
have
his
word
doubted
but
kennedy
was
no
respecter
of
persons
he
took
the
pen
and
wrote
i
keep
your
name
out
of
it
as
much
as
possible
remarked
kennedy
glancing
intently
at
the
writing
and
blotting
it
thank
you
said
collins
simply
for
once
in
his
life
at
a
loss
for
words
once
more
he
whispered
to
then
he
excused
himself
the
man
was
so
obviously
sincere
i
felt
as
far
as
his
selfish
and
sensual
limitations
would
permit
that
i
would
not
have
blamed
kennedy
for
giving
him
much
more
encouragement
than
he
had
given
kennedy
was
not
through
yet
and
now
turned
quickly
again
to
the
cosmetic
arcadia
which
had
been
so
rudely
stirred
by
the
tragedy
who
is
this
girl
agnes
who
discovered
miss
blaisdell
he
shot
out
at
the
millefleurs
the
was
now
really
painful
in
his
excitement
like
his
establishment
even
his
feelings
were
artificial
agnes
he
repeated
why
she
was
one
of
madame
best
see
my
dear
show
the
gentlemen
the
book
of
engagements
it
was
a
large
book
full
of
girls
names
each
an
expert
in
curls
puffs
reinforcements
hygienic
rolls
transformators
and
the
numberless
other
things
that
made
the
fearful
and
wonderful
of
the
day
agnes
dates
were
full
for
a
day
ahead
kennedy
ran
his
eye
over
the
list
of
patrons
burke
collins
he
read
was
she
a
patron
too
oh
yes
answered
madame
she
used
to
come
here
three
times
a
week
it
was
not
vanity
we
all
knew
her
and
we
all
liked
her
instantly
i
could
read
between
the
lines
and
i
felt
that
i
had
been
too
charitable
to
burke
collins
here
was
the
wife
slaving
to
secure
that
beauty
which
would
win
back
the
man
with
whom
she
had
worked
and
toiled
in
the
years
before
they
came
to
new
york
and
success
the
other
woman
came
here
too
but
for
a
very
different
reason
nothing
but
business
seemed
to
impress
millefleur
however
oh
yes
he
volunteered
we
have
a
fine
class
among
my
own
patients
i
have
hugh
dayton
the
actor
you
know
leading
man
in
blanche
company
he
is
having
his
hair
restored
why
i
gave
him
a
treatment
this
afternoon
if
ever
there
is
a
crazy
man
it
is
he
i
believe
he
would
kill
collins
for
the
way
blanche
blaisdell
treats
him
they
were
engaged
but
oh
well
he
gave
a
very
good
imitation
of
a
french
shrug
it
is
all
over
now
neither
of
them
will
get
her
and
i
i
am
ruined
who
will
come
to
the
novella
now
adjoining
millefleur
own
room
was
the
writing
room
from
which
the
poisoned
envelope
had
been
taken
to
miss
blaisdell
over
the
little
secretary
was
the
sign
no
woman
need
be
plain
who
will
visit
the
novella
evidently
the
motto
of
the
place
the
room
was
next
to
the
little
there
were
manicure
rooms
rooms
of
all
descriptions
all
bearing
mute
testimony
to
the
fundamental
instinct
the
feminine
longing
for
personal
beauty
though
it
was
late
when
kennedy
had
finished
his
investigation
he
insisted
on
going
directly
to
his
laboratory
there
he
pulled
out
from
a
corner
a
sort
of
little
square
table
on
which
was
fixed
a
powerful
light
such
as
might
be
used
for
a
stereopticon
this
is
a
simple
little
machine
he
explained
as
be
pasted
together
the
torn
bits
of
the
letter
which
he
had
fished
out
of
the
which
detectives
use
in
studying
forgeries
i
do
know
that
it
has
a
name
although
it
might
be
called
a
you
see
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
lay
the
thing
you
wish
to
study
flat
here
and
the
system
of
mirrors
and
lenses
reflects
it
and
enlarges
it
on
a
sheet
he
had
lowered
a
sheet
of
white
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
room
and
there
in
huge
characters
stood
forth
plainly
the
writing
of
the
note
this
letter
he
resumed
studying
the
enlargement
carefully
is
likely
to
prove
crucial
it
very
queer
collins
says
he
did
write
it
and
if
he
did
he
surely
is
a
wonder
at
disguising
his
hand
i
doubt
if
any
one
could
disguise
what
the
rayograph
shows
now
for
instance
this
is
very
important
do
you
see
how
those
strokes
of
the
long
letters
are
well
wobbly
you
never
see
that
in
the
original
but
when
it
is
enlarged
you
see
how
plainly
visible
the
tremors
of
the
hand
become
try
as
you
may
you
ca
conceal
them
the
fact
is
that
the
writer
of
this
note
suffered
from
a
form
of
heart
disease
now
let
us
look
at
the
copy
that
collins
made
at
the
novella
he
placed
the
copy
on
the
table
of
the
rayograph
it
was
quite
evident
that
the
two
had
been
written
by
entirely
different
persons
i
thought
he
was
telling
the
truth
commented
craig
by
the
surprised
look
on
his
face
the
moment
i
mentioned
the
note
to
miss
blaisdell
now
i
know
he
was
there
is
no
such
evidence
of
heart
trouble
in
his
writing
as
in
the
other
of
course
that
all
aside
from
what
a
study
of
the
handwriting
itself
might
disclose
they
are
not
similar
at
all
but
there
is
an
important
clue
there
find
the
writer
of
that
note
who
has
heart
trouble
and
we
either
have
the
murderer
or
some
one
close
to
the
murderer
i
remembered
the
tremulousness
of
the
little
his
artificial
acting
of
fear
for
the
reputation
of
the
novella
and
i
must
confess
i
agreed
with
and
collins
that
it
looked
black
for
him
at
one
time
i
had
suspected
collins
himself
but
now
i
could
see
perfectly
why
he
had
not
concealed
his
anxiety
to
hush
up
his
connection
with
the
case
while
at
the
same
time
his
instinct
as
a
lawyer
and
i
had
almost
added
lover
told
him
that
justice
must
be
done
i
saw
at
once
how
accustomed
as
he
was
to
weigh
evidence
he
had
immediately
seen
the
justification
for
arrest
of
the
millefleurs
more
than
that
added
kennedy
after
examining
the
fibres
of
the
paper
under
a
microscope
all
these
notes
are
written
on
the
same
kind
of
paper
that
first
torn
note
to
miss
blaisdell
was
written
right
in
the
novella
and
left
so
as
to
seem
to
have
been
sent
in
from
outside
it
was
early
the
following
morning
when
kennedy
roused
me
with
the
remark
i
think
i
go
up
to
the
hospital
do
you
want
to
come
along
we
stop
for
barron
on
the
way
there
is
a
little
experiment
i
want
to
try
on
that
girl
up
there
when
we
arrived
the
nurse
in
charge
of
the
ward
told
us
that
her
patient
had
passed
a
fairly
good
night
but
that
now
that
the
influence
of
the
drug
had
worn
off
she
was
again
restless
and
still
repeating
the
words
that
she
had
said
over
and
over
before
nor
had
she
been
able
to
give
any
clearer
account
of
herself
apparently
she
had
been
alone
in
the
city
for
although
there
was
a
news
item
about
her
in
the
morning
papers
so
far
no
relative
or
friend
had
called
to
identify
her
kennedy
had
placed
himself
directly
before
her
listening
intently
to
her
ravings
suddenly
he
managed
to
fix
her
eye
as
if
by
a
sort
of
hypnotic
influence
agnes
he
called
in
a
sharp
tone
the
name
seemed
to
arrest
her
fugitive
attention
before
she
could
escape
from
his
mental
grasp
again
he
added
your
is
full
are
you
going
to
the
novella
this
morning
the
change
in
her
was
something
wonderful
to
see
it
was
as
though
she
had
come
out
of
a
trance
she
sat
up
in
bed
and
gazed
about
blankly
yes
yes
i
must
go
she
cried
as
if
it
were
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
then
she
realised
the
strange
surroundings
and
faces
where
is
my
hat
am
i
what
has
happened
you
are
all
right
soothed
kennedy
gently
now
rest
try
to
forget
everything
for
a
little
while
and
you
will
be
all
right
you
are
among
friends
as
kennedy
led
us
out
she
fell
back
now
physically
exhausted
on
the
pillow
i
told
you
barron
he
whispered
that
there
was
more
to
this
case
than
you
imagined
unwittingly
you
brought
me
a
very
important
contribution
to
a
case
of
which
the
papers
are
full
this
morning
the
case
of
the
murdered
actress
blanche
blaisdell
iv
the
beauty
shop
it
was
only
after
a
few
hours
that
kennedy
thought
it
wise
to
try
to
question
the
poor
girl
at
the
hospital
her
story
was
simple
enough
in
itself
but
it
certainly
complicated
matters
considerably
without
throwing
much
light
on
the
case
she
had
been
busy
because
her
day
was
full
and
she
had
yet
to
dress
the
hair
of
miss
blaisdell
for
her
play
that
night
several
times
she
had
been
interrupted
by
impatient
messages
from
the
actress
in
her
little
and
one
of
the
girls
had
already
demolished
the
previous
in
order
to
save
time
once
agnes
had
run
down
for
a
few
seconds
to
reassure
her
that
she
would
be
through
in
time
she
had
found
the
actress
reading
a
newspaper
and
when
kennedy
questioned
her
she
remembered
seeing
a
note
lying
on
the
dresser
agnes
miss
blaisdell
had
said
will
you
go
into
the
and
bring
me
some
paper
a
pen
and
ink
i
do
want
to
go
in
there
this
way
there
a
dear
good
girl
agnes
had
gone
though
it
was
decidedly
no
part
of
her
duty
as
one
of
the
highest
paid
employes
of
the
novella
but
they
all
envied
the
popular
actress
and
were
ready
to
do
anything
for
her
the
next
thing
she
remembered
was
finishing
the
coiffure
she
was
working
on
and
going
to
miss
blaisdell
there
lay
the
beautiful
actress
the
light
in
the
corridor
had
not
been
lighted
yet
and
it
was
dark
her
lips
and
mouth
seemed
literally
to
shine
agnes
called
her
but
she
did
not
move
she
touched
her
but
she
was
cold
then
she
screamed
and
fled
that
was
the
last
she
remembered
the
little
reasoned
kennedy
as
we
left
the
poor
little
quite
exhausted
by
her
narrative
was
next
to
the
sanctum
of
millefleur
where
they
found
that
bottle
of
ether
phosphore
and
the
oil
of
turpentine
some
one
who
knew
of
that
note
or
perhaps
wrote
it
must
have
reasoned
that
an
answer
would
be
written
immediately
that
person
figured
that
the
note
would
be
the
next
thing
written
and
that
the
top
envelope
of
the
pile
would
be
used
that
person
knew
of
the
deadly
qualities
of
too
much
phosphorised
ether
and
painted
the
gummed
flap
of
the
envelope
with
several
grains
of
it
the
reasoning
held
good
for
agnes
took
the
top
envelope
with
its
poisoned
flap
to
miss
blaisdell
no
there
was
no
chance
about
that
it
was
all
clever
quick
reasoning
but
i
objected
how
about
the
oil
of
turpentine
simply
to
remove
the
traces
of
the
poison
i
think
you
will
see
why
that
was
attempted
before
we
get
through
kennedy
would
say
no
more
but
i
was
content
because
i
could
see
that
he
was
now
ready
to
put
his
theories
whatever
they
were
to
the
final
test
he
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
working
at
the
hospital
with
barron
adjusting
a
very
delicate
piece
of
apparatus
down
in
a
special
room
in
the
basement
i
saw
it
but
i
had
no
idea
what
it
was
or
what
its
use
might
be
close
to
the
wall
was
a
stereopticon
which
shot
a
beam
of
light
through
a
tube
to
which
i
heard
them
refer
as
a
galvanometer
about
three
feet
distant
in
front
of
this
beam
whirled
a
wheel
governed
by
a
chronometer
which
erred
only
a
second
a
day
between
the
poles
of
the
galvanometer
was
stretched
a
slender
thread
of
fused
quartz
plated
with
silver
only
one
of
a
millimetre
in
diameter
so
tenuous
that
it
could
not
be
seen
except
in
a
bright
light
it
was
a
thread
so
slender
that
it
might
have
been
spun
by
a
microscopic
spider
three
feet
farther
away
was
a
camera
with
a
moving
film
of
sensitised
material
the
turning
of
which
was
regulated
by
a
little
flywheel
the
beam
of
light
focused
on
the
thread
in
the
galvanometer
passed
to
the
photographic
film
intercepted
only
by
the
five
spindles
of
the
wheel
which
turned
once
a
second
thus
marking
the
picture
off
into
exact
fifths
of
a
second
the
vibrations
of
the
microscopic
quartz
thread
were
enormously
magnified
on
the
sensitive
film
by
a
lens
and
resulted
in
producing
a
long
wavy
line
the
whole
was
shielded
by
a
wooden
hood
which
permitted
no
light
except
the
slender
ray
to
strike
it
the
film
revolved
slowly
across
the
field
its
speed
regulated
by
the
flywheel
and
all
moved
by
an
electric
motor
i
was
quite
surprised
then
when
kennedy
told
me
that
the
final
tests
which
he
was
arranging
were
not
to
be
held
at
the
hospital
at
all
but
in
his
laboratory
the
scene
of
so
many
of
his
scientific
triumphs
over
the
cleverest
of
criminals
while
he
and
dr
barren
were
still
fussing
with
the
machine
he
despatched
me
on
the
rather
ticklish
errand
of
gathering
together
all
those
who
had
been
at
the
novella
at
the
time
and
might
possibly
prove
important
in
the
case
my
first
visit
was
to
hugh
dayton
whom
i
found
in
his
bachelor
apartment
on
madison
avenue
apparently
waiting
for
me
one
of
men
had
already
warned
him
that
any
attempt
to
evade
putting
in
an
appearance
when
he
was
wanted
would
be
of
no
avail
he
had
been
shadowed
from
the
moment
that
it
was
learned
that
he
was
a
patient
of
millefleur
and
had
been
at
the
novella
that
fatal
afternoon
he
seemed
to
realise
that
escape
was
impossible
dayton
was
one
of
those
typical
young
fellows
tall
with
sloping
shoulders
and
a
carefully
acquired
english
manner
whom
one
sees
in
scores
on
fifth
avenue
late
in
the
afternoon
his
face
which
on
the
stage
was
forceful
and
attractive
was
not
prepossessing
at
close
range
indeed
it
showed
too
evident
marks
of
excesses
both
physical
and
moral
and
his
hand
was
none
too
steady
still
he
was
an
interesting
personality
if
not
engaging
i
was
also
charged
with
delivering
a
note
to
burke
collins
at
his
office
the
purport
of
it
was
i
knew
a
request
couched
in
language
that
veiled
a
summons
that
collins
was
of
great
importance
in
getting
at
the
truth
and
that
if
he
needed
an
excuse
himself
for
being
present
it
was
suggested
that
he
appear
as
protecting
his
interests
as
a
lawyer
kennedy
had
added
that
i
might
tell
him
orally
that
he
would
pass
over
the
scandal
as
lightly
as
possible
and
spare
the
feelings
of
both
as
much
as
he
could
i
was
rather
relieved
when
this
mission
was
accomplished
for
i
had
expected
collins
to
demur
violently
those
who
gathered
that
night
sitting
expectantly
in
the
little
armchairs
which
kennedy
students
used
during
his
lectures
included
nearly
every
one
who
could
cast
any
light
on
what
had
happened
at
the
novella
professor
and
madame
millefleur
were
brought
up
from
the
house
of
detention
to
which
both
and
leslie
had
insisted
that
they
be
sent
millefleur
was
still
bewailing
the
fate
of
the
novella
and
madame
had
begun
to
show
evidences
of
lack
of
the
constant
beautification
which
she
was
always
preaching
as
of
the
utmost
importance
to
her
patrons
agnes
was
so
far
recovered
as
to
be
able
to
be
present
though
i
noticed
that
she
avoided
the
millefleurs
and
sat
as
far
from
them
as
possible
burke
collins
and
collins
arrived
together
i
had
expected
that
there
would
be
an
icy
coolness
if
not
positive
enmity
between
them
they
were
not
exactly
cordial
though
somehow
i
seemed
to
feel
that
now
that
the
cause
of
estrangement
was
removed
a
tactful
mutual
friend
might
have
brought
about
a
reconciliation
hugh
dayton
swaggered
in
his
nervousness
gone
or
at
least
controlled
i
passed
behind
him
once
and
the
odour
that
smote
my
olfactory
sense
told
me
too
plainly
that
he
had
fortified
himself
with
a
stimulant
on
his
way
from
the
apartment
to
the
laboratory
of
course
and
leslie
were
there
though
in
the
background
it
was
a
silent
gathering
and
kennedy
did
not
attempt
to
relieve
the
tension
even
by
small
talk
as
he
wrapped
the
forearms
of
each
of
us
with
cloths
steeped
in
a
solution
of
salt
upon
these
cloths
he
placed
little
plates
of
german
silver
to
which
were
attached
wires
which
led
back
of
a
screen
at
last
he
was
ready
to
begin
the
long
history
of
science
he
began
as
he
emerged
from
behind
the
screen
is
filled
with
instances
of
phenomena
noted
at
first
only
for
their
beauty
or
mystery
which
have
been
later
proved
to
be
of
great
practical
value
to
mankind
a
new
example
is
the
striking
phenomenon
of
luminescence
phosphorus
discovered
centuries
ago
was
first
merely
a
curiosity
now
it
is
used
for
many
practical
things
and
one
of
the
latest
uses
is
as
a
medicine
it
is
a
constituent
of
the
body
and
many
doctors
believe
that
the
lack
of
it
causes
and
that
its
presence
will
cure
many
ills
but
it
is
a
virulent
and
toxic
drug
and
no
physician
except
one
who
knows
his
business
thoroughly
should
presume
to
handle
it
whoever
made
a
practice
of
using
it
at
the
novella
did
not
know
his
business
or
he
would
have
used
it
in
pills
instead
of
in
the
nauseous
liquid
it
is
not
with
phosphorised
ether
as
a
medicine
that
we
have
to
deal
in
this
case
it
is
with
the
stuff
as
a
poison
a
poison
administered
by
a
demon
craig
shot
the
word
out
so
that
it
had
its
full
effect
on
his
little
audience
then
he
paused
lowered
his
voice
and
resumed
on
a
new
subject
up
in
the
washington
heights
hospital
he
went
on
is
an
apparatus
which
records
the
secrets
of
the
human
heart
that
is
no
figure
of
speech
but
a
cold
scientific
fact
this
machine
records
every
variation
of
the
pulsations
of
the
heart
with
such
exquisite
accuracy
that
it
gives
barron
who
is
up
there
now
not
merely
a
diagram
of
the
throbbing
organ
of
each
of
you
seated
here
in
my
laboratory
a
mile
away
but
a
sort
of
of
the
emotions
by
which
each
heart
here
is
swayed
not
only
can
barron
diagnose
disease
but
he
can
detect
love
hate
fear
joy
anger
and
remorse
this
machine
is
known
as
the
einthoven
galvanometer
invented
by
that
famous
dutch
physiologist
of
leyden
there
was
a
perceptible
movement
in
our
little
audience
at
the
thought
that
the
little
wires
that
ran
back
of
the
screen
from
the
arms
of
each
were
connected
with
this
uncanny
instrument
so
far
away
it
is
all
done
by
the
electric
current
that
the
heart
itself
generates
pursued
kennedy
hammering
home
the
new
and
startling
idea
that
current
is
one
of
the
feeblest
known
to
science
for
the
dynamo
that
generates
it
is
no
ponderous
thing
of
copper
wire
and
steel
castings
it
is
just
the
heart
itself
the
heart
sends
over
the
wire
its
own
telltale
record
to
the
machine
which
registers
it
the
thing
takes
us
all
the
way
back
to
galvani
who
was
the
first
to
observe
and
study
animal
electricity
the
heart
makes
only
one
of
a
volt
of
electricity
at
each
beat
it
would
take
over
two
hundred
thousand
men
to
light
one
of
these
incandescent
lamps
two
million
or
more
to
run
a
yet
just
that
slight
little
current
is
enough
to
sway
the
gossamer
strand
of
quartz
fibre
up
there
at
what
we
call
the
station
so
fine
is
this
machine
that
the
produced
by
the
sphygmograph
which
i
have
used
in
other
cases
up
to
this
time
are
clumsy
and
inexact
again
he
paused
as
if
to
let
the
fear
of
discovery
sink
deep
into
the
minds
of
all
of
us
this
current
as
i
have
said
passes
from
each
one
of
you
in
turn
over
a
wire
and
vibrates
a
fine
quartz
fibre
up
there
in
unison
with
each
heart
here
it
is
one
of
the
most
delicate
bits
of
mechanism
ever
made
beside
which
the
hairspring
of
a
watch
is
coarse
each
of
you
in
turn
is
being
subjected
to
this
test
more
than
that
the
record
up
there
shows
not
only
the
beats
of
the
heart
but
the
successive
waves
of
emotion
that
vary
the
form
of
those
beats
every
normal
individual
gives
what
we
call
an
which
follows
a
certain
type
the
photographic
film
on
which
this
is
being
recorded
is
ruled
so
that
at
the
heart
station
barron
can
read
it
there
are
five
waves
to
each
which
he
letters
p
q
r
s
and
t
two
below
and
three
above
a
base
line
on
the
film
they
have
all
been
found
to
represent
a
contraction
of
a
certain
portion
of
the
heart
any
change
of
the
height
width
or
time
of
any
one
of
those
lines
shows
that
there
is
some
defect
or
change
in
the
contraction
of
that
part
of
the
heart
thus
barron
who
has
studied
this
thing
carefully
can
tell
infallibly
not
only
disease
but
emotion
it
seemed
as
if
no
one
dared
look
at
his
neighbour
as
if
all
were
trying
vainly
to
control
the
beating
of
their
own
hearts
now
concluded
kennedy
solemnly
as
if
to
force
the
last
secret
from
the
wildly
beating
heart
of
some
one
in
the
room
it
is
my
belief
that
the
person
who
had
access
to
the
of
the
novella
was
a
person
whose
nerves
were
run
down
and
in
addition
to
any
other
treatment
that
person
was
familiar
with
the
ether
phosphore
this
person
knew
miss
blaisdell
well
saw
her
there
knew
she
was
there
for
the
purpose
of
frustrating
that
person
own
dearest
hopes
that
person
wrote
her
the
note
and
knowing
that
she
would
ask
for
paper
and
an
envelope
in
order
to
answer
it
poisoned
the
flap
of
the
envelope
phosphorus
is
a
remedy
for
hysteria
vexatious
emotions
want
of
sympathy
disappointed
and
concealed
affections
but
not
in
the
quantities
that
this
person
lavished
on
that
flap
whoever
it
was
not
life
but
death
and
a
ghastly
death
was
uppermost
in
that
thoughts
agnes
screamed
i
saw
him
take
something
and
rub
it
on
her
lips
and
the
brightness
went
away
i
i
did
mean
to
tell
but
god
help
me
i
must
saw
whom
demanded
kennedy
fixing
her
eye
as
he
had
when
he
had
called
her
back
from
aphasia
him
millefleur
miller
she
sobbed
shrinking
back
as
if
the
very
confession
appalled
her
yes
added
kennedy
coolly
miller
did
try
to
remove
the
traces
of
the
poison
after
he
discovered
it
in
order
to
protect
himself
and
the
reputation
of
the
novella
the
telephone
bell
tinkled
craig
seized
the
receiver
yes
barron
this
is
kennedy
you
received
the
impulses
all
right
good
and
have
you
had
time
to
study
the
records
yes
what
that
number
seven
all
right
i
see
you
very
soon
and
go
over
the
records
again
with
you
one
word
more
he
continued
now
facing
us
the
normal
heart
traces
its
throbs
in
regular
rhythm
the
diseased
or
overwrought
heart
throbs
in
degrees
of
irregularity
that
vary
according
to
the
trouble
that
affects
it
both
organic
and
emotional
the
expert
like
barron
can
tell
what
each
wave
means
just
as
he
can
tell
what
the
lines
in
a
spectrum
mean
he
can
see
the
invisible
hear
the
inaudible
feel
the
intangible
with
mathematical
precision
barron
has
now
read
the
each
is
a
picture
of
the
beating
of
the
heart
that
made
it
and
each
smallest
variation
has
a
meaning
to
him
every
passion
every
emotion
every
disease
is
recorded
with
inexorable
truth
the
person
with
murder
in
his
heart
can
not
hide
it
from
the
string
galvanometer
nor
can
that
person
who
wrote
the
false
note
in
which
the
very
lines
of
the
letters
betray
a
diseased
heart
hide
that
disease
the
doctor
tells
me
that
that
person
was
number
collins
had
risen
wildly
and
was
standing
before
us
with
blazing
eyes
yes
she
cried
pressing
her
hands
on
her
breast
as
if
it
were
about
to
burst
and
tell
the
secret
before
her
lips
could
frame
the
words
yes
i
killed
her
and
i
would
follow
her
to
the
end
of
the
earth
if
i
had
not
succeeded
she
was
there
the
woman
who
had
stolen
from
me
what
was
more
than
life
itself
yes
i
wrote
the
note
i
poisoned
the
envelope
i
killed
her
all
the
intense
hatred
that
she
had
felt
for
that
other
woman
in
the
days
that
she
had
vainly
striven
to
equal
her
in
beauty
and
win
back
her
husband
love
broke
forth
she
was
wonderful
magnificent
in
her
fury
she
was
passion
personified
she
was
fate
retribution
collins
looked
at
his
wife
and
even
he
felt
the
spell
it
was
not
crime
that
she
had
done
it
was
elemental
justice
for
a
moment
she
stood
silent
facing
kennedy
then
the
colour
slowly
faded
from
her
cheeks
she
reeled
collins
caught
her
and
imprinted
a
kiss
the
kiss
that
for
years
she
had
longed
and
striven
for
again
she
looked
rather
than
spoke
forgiveness
as
he
held
her
and
showered
them
on
her
before
heaven
i
heard
him
whisper
into
her
ear
with
all
my
power
as
a
lawyer
i
will
free
you
from
this
gently
leslie
pushed
him
aside
and
felt
her
pulse
as
she
dropped
limply
into
the
only
easy
chair
in
the
laboratory
he
said
at
length
all
the
evidence
that
we
really
have
hangs
on
an
invisible
thread
of
quartz
a
mile
away
if
professor
kennedy
agrees
let
us
forget
what
has
happened
here
i
will
direct
my
jury
to
bring
in
a
verdict
of
suicide
collins
take
good
care
of
her
he
leaned
over
and
whispered
so
she
could
not
hear
i
would
promise
her
six
weeks
otherwise
i
could
not
help
feeling
deeply
moved
as
the
newly
reunited
collinses
left
the
laboratory
together
even
the
bluff
deputy
was
touched
by
it
and
under
the
circumstances
did
what
seemed
to
him
his
higher
duty
with
a
tact
of
which
i
had
believed
him
scarcely
capable
whatever
the
ethics
of
the
case
he
left
it
entirely
to
coroner
jury
to
determine
burke
collins
was
already
making
hasty
preparations
for
the
care
of
his
wife
so
that
she
might
have
the
best
medical
attention
to
prolong
her
life
for
the
few
weeks
or
months
before
nature
exacted
the
penalty
which
was
denied
the
law
that
a
marvellous
piece
of
apparatus
i
remarked
standing
over
the
connections
with
the
string
galvanometer
after
all
had
gone
just
suppose
the
case
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
some
of
these
detectives
i
hate
on
my
own
cases
interrupted
kennedy
brusquely
will
be
time
enough
to
clear
up
this
mess
meanwhile
let
us
get
this
thing
out
of
our
minds
he
clapped
his
hat
on
his
head
decisively
and
deliberately
walked
out
of
the
laboratory
starting
off
at
a
brisk
pace
in
the
moonlight
across
the
campus
to
the
avenue
where
now
the
only
sound
was
the
noisy
rattle
of
an
occasional
trolley
car
how
long
we
walked
i
do
not
know
but
i
do
know
that
for
genuine
relaxation
after
a
long
period
of
keen
mental
stress
there
is
nothing
like
physical
exercise
we
turned
into
our
apartment
roused
the
sleepy
and
rode
up
i
suppose
people
think
i
never
rest
remarked
kennedy
carefully
avoiding
any
reference
to
the
exciting
events
of
the
past
two
days
but
i
do
like
every
one
else
i
have
to
when
i
am
working
hard
on
a
case
well
i
have
my
own
violent
reaction
against
it
more
work
of
a
different
kind
others
choose
white
lights
red
wines
and
blue
feelings
afterwards
but
i
find
when
i
reach
that
state
that
the
best
is
something
that
will
chase
the
last
case
from
your
brain
by
getting
you
in
trim
for
the
next
unexpected
event
he
had
sunk
into
an
easy
chair
where
he
was
running
over
in
his
mind
his
own
plans
for
the
morrow
just
now
i
must
recuperate
by
doing
no
work
at
all
he
went
on
slowly
undressing
that
walk
was
just
what
i
needed
when
the
fever
of
dissipation
comes
on
again
i
call
on
you
you
wo
miss
anything
walter
like
the
famous
finnegan
however
he
was
on
again
and
gone
again
in
the
morning
this
time
i
had
no
misgivings
although
i
should
have
liked
to
accompany
him
for
on
the
library
table
he
had
scrawled
a
little
note
studying
east
side
will
keep
in
touch
with
you
craig
my
daily
task
of
transcribing
my
notes
was
completed
and
i
thought
i
would
run
down
to
the
star
to
let
the
editor
know
how
i
was
getting
along
on
my
assignment
i
had
scarcely
entered
the
door
when
the
office
boy
thrust
a
message
into
my
hand
it
stopped
me
even
before
i
had
a
chance
to
get
as
far
as
my
own
desk
it
was
from
kennedy
at
the
laboratory
and
bore
a
time
stamp
that
showed
that
it
must
have
been
received
only
a
few
minutes
before
i
came
in
meet
me
at
the
grand
central
it
read
immediately
without
going
further
into
the
office
i
turned
and
dropped
down
in
the
elevator
to
the
subway
as
quickly
as
an
express
could
take
me
i
hurried
up
to
the
new
station
where
away
i
asked
breathlessly
as
craig
met
me
at
the
entrance
through
which
he
had
reasoned
i
would
come
the
coast
or
down
east
woodrock
he
replied
quickly
taking
my
arm
and
dragging
me
down
a
ramp
to
the
train
that
was
just
leaving
for
that
fashionable
suburb
well
i
queried
eagerly
as
the
train
started
why
all
this
secrecy
i
had
a
caller
this
afternoon
he
began
running
his
eye
over
the
other
passengers
to
see
if
we
were
observed
she
is
going
back
on
this
train
i
am
not
to
recognise
her
at
the
station
but
you
and
i
are
to
walk
to
the
end
of
the
platform
and
enter
a
limousine
bearing
that
number
he
produced
a
card
on
the
back
of
which
was
written
a
number
in
six
figures
mechanically
i
glanced
at
the
name
as
he
handed
the
card
to
me
craig
was
watching
intently
the
expression
on
my
face
as
i
read
miss
yvonne
brixton
since
when
were
you
admitted
into
society
i
gasped
still
staring
at
the
name
of
the
daughter
of
the
millionaire
banker
john
brixton
she
came
to
tell
me
that
her
father
is
in
a
virtual
state
of
siege
as
it
were
up
there
in
his
own
house
explained
kennedy
in
an
undertone
so
much
so
that
apparently
she
is
the
only
person
he
felt
he
dared
trust
with
a
message
to
summon
me
practically
everything
he
says
or
does
is
spied
on
he
ca
even
telephone
without
what
he
says
being
known
siege
i
repeated
incredulously
impossible
why
only
this
morning
i
was
reading
about
his
negotiations
with
a
foreign
syndicate
of
bankers
from
southeastern
europe
for
a
loan
to
relieve
the
money
stringency
there
surely
there
must
be
some
mistake
in
all
this
in
fact
as
i
recall
it
one
of
the
foreign
bankers
who
is
trying
to
interest
him
is
that
count
wachtmann
who
everybody
says
is
engaged
to
miss
brixton
and
is
staying
at
the
house
at
woodrock
craig
are
you
sure
nobody
is
hoaxing
you
read
that
he
replied
laconically
handing
me
a
piece
of
thin
such
as
is
often
used
for
foreign
correspondence
such
letters
have
been
coming
to
brixton
i
understand
every
day
the
letter
was
in
a
cramped
foreign
scrawl
john
brixton
woodrock
new
york
american
dollars
must
not
endanger
the
peace
of
europe
be
warned
in
time
in
the
name
of
liberty
and
progress
we
have
raised
the
standard
of
conflict
without
truce
or
quarter
against
reaction
if
you
and
the
american
bankers
associated
with
you
take
up
these
bonds
you
will
never
live
to
receive
the
first
payment
of
interest
the
red
brotherhood
of
the
balkans
i
looked
up
inquiringly
what
is
the
red
brotherhood
i
asked
as
nearly
as
i
can
make
out
replied
kennedy
it
seems
to
be
a
sort
of
international
secret
society
i
believe
it
preaches
the
gospel
of
terror
and
violence
in
the
cause
of
liberty
and
union
of
some
of
the
peoples
of
southeastern
europe
anyhow
it
keeps
its
secrets
well
the
identity
of
the
members
is
a
mystery
as
well
as
the
source
of
its
funds
which
it
is
said
are
immense
and
they
operate
so
secretly
that
brixton
can
trust
no
one
about
him
i
asked
i
believe
he
is
ill
explained
craig
at
any
rate
he
evidently
suspects
almost
every
one
about
him
except
his
daughter
as
nearly
as
i
could
gather
however
he
does
not
suspect
wachtmann
himself
miss
brixton
seemed
to
think
that
there
were
some
enemies
of
the
count
at
work
her
father
is
a
secretive
man
even
to
her
the
only
message
he
would
entrust
was
that
he
wanted
to
see
me
immediately
at
woodrock
we
took
our
time
in
getting
off
the
train
miss
brixton
a
tall
athletic
girl
just
out
of
college
had
preceded
us
and
as
her
own
car
shot
out
from
the
station
platform
we
leisurely
walked
down
and
entered
another
bearing
the
number
she
had
given
kennedy
we
seemed
to
be
expected
at
the
house
hardly
had
we
been
admitted
through
the
door
from
the
than
we
were
led
through
a
hall
to
a
library
at
the
side
of
the
house
from
the
library
we
entered
another
door
then
down
a
flight
of
steps
which
must
have
brought
us
below
an
open
courtyard
on
the
outside
under
a
rim
of
the
terrace
in
front
of
the
house
for
a
short
distance
to
a
point
where
we
descended
three
more
steps
at
the
head
of
these
three
steps
was
a
great
steel
and
iron
door
with
heavy
bolts
and
a
combination
lock
of
a
character
ordinarily
found
only
on
a
safe
in
a
banking
institution
the
door
was
opened
and
we
descended
the
steps
going
a
little
farther
in
the
same
direction
away
from
the
side
of
the
house
then
we
turned
at
a
right
angle
facing
toward
the
back
of
the
house
but
well
to
one
side
of
it
it
must
have
been
i
figured
out
later
underneath
the
open
courtyard
a
few
steps
farther
brought
us
to
a
vaulted
room
v
the
phantom
circuit
brixton
had
evidently
been
waiting
impatiently
for
our
arrival
mr
kennedy
he
inquired
adding
quickly
without
waiting
for
an
answer
i
am
glad
to
see
you
i
suppose
you
have
noticed
the
precautions
we
are
taking
against
intruders
yet
it
seems
to
be
all
of
no
avail
i
can
not
be
alone
even
here
if
a
telephone
message
comes
to
me
over
my
private
wire
if
i
talk
with
my
own
office
in
the
city
it
seems
that
it
is
known
i
do
know
what
to
make
of
it
it
is
terrible
i
do
know
what
to
expect
next
brixton
had
been
standing
beside
a
huge
mahogany
desk
as
we
entered
i
had
seen
him
before
at
a
distance
as
a
somewhat
pompous
speaker
at
banquets
and
the
cynosure
of
the
financial
district
but
there
was
something
different
about
his
looks
now
he
seemed
to
have
aged
to
have
grown
yellower
even
the
whites
of
his
eyes
were
yellow
i
thought
at
first
that
perhaps
it
might
be
the
effect
of
the
light
in
the
centre
of
the
room
a
huge
affair
set
in
the
ceiling
in
a
sort
of
inverted
hemisphere
of
glass
concealing
and
softening
the
rays
of
a
powerful
incandescent
bulb
which
it
enclosed
it
was
not
the
light
that
gave
him
the
altered
appearance
as
i
concluded
from
catching
a
casual
confirmatory
glance
of
perplexity
from
kennedy
himself
my
personal
physician
says
i
am
suffering
from
jaundice
explained
brixton
rather
than
seeming
to
be
offended
at
our
notice
of
his
condition
he
seemed
to
take
it
as
a
good
evidence
of
kennedy
keenness
that
he
had
at
once
hit
on
one
of
the
things
that
were
weighing
on
brixton
own
mind
i
feel
pretty
badly
too
curse
it
he
added
bitterly
coming
at
a
time
when
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
i
should
have
all
my
strength
to
carry
through
a
negotiation
that
is
only
a
beginning
important
not
so
much
for
myself
as
for
the
whole
world
it
is
one
of
the
first
times
new
york
bankers
have
had
a
chance
to
engage
in
big
dealings
in
that
part
of
the
world
i
suppose
yvonne
has
shown
you
one
of
the
letters
i
am
receiving
he
rustled
a
sheaf
of
them
which
he
drew
from
a
drawer
of
his
desk
and
continued
not
waiting
for
kennedy
even
to
nod
here
are
a
dozen
or
more
of
them
i
get
one
or
two
every
day
either
here
or
at
my
town
house
or
at
the
office
kennedy
had
moved
forward
to
see
them
one
moment
more
brixton
interrupted
still
holding
them
i
shall
come
back
to
the
letters
that
is
not
the
worst
i
had
threatening
letters
before
have
you
noticed
this
room
we
had
both
seen
and
been
impressed
by
it
let
me
tell
you
more
about
it
he
went
on
it
was
designed
especially
to
be
among
other
things
absolutely
soundproof
we
gazed
curiously
about
the
strong
room
it
was
beautifully
decorated
and
furnished
on
the
walls
was
a
sort
of
heavy
velvety
green
exquisite
hangings
were
draped
about
and
on
the
floor
were
thick
rugs
in
all
i
noticed
that
the
prevailing
tint
was
green
i
had
experiments
carried
out
he
explained
languidly
with
the
object
of
discovering
methods
and
means
for
rendering
walls
and
ceilings
capable
of
effective
resistance
to
sound
transmission
one
of
the
methods
devised
involved
the
use
under
the
ceiling
or
parallel
to
the
wall
as
the
case
might
be
of
a
network
of
wire
stretched
tightly
by
means
of
pulleys
in
the
adjacent
walls
and
not
touching
at
any
point
the
surface
to
be
protected
against
sound
upon
the
wire
network
is
plastered
a
composition
formed
of
strong
glue
plaster
of
paris
and
granulated
cork
so
as
to
make
a
flat
slab
between
which
and
the
wall
or
ceiling
is
a
cushion
of
confined
air
the
method
is
good
in
two
respects
the
absence
of
contact
between
the
protective
and
protected
surfaces
and
the
colloid
nature
of
the
composition
used
i
have
gone
into
the
thing
at
length
because
it
will
make
all
the
more
remarkable
what
i
am
about
to
tell
you
kennedy
had
been
listening
attentively
as
brixton
proceeded
i
had
noticed
kennedy
nostrils
dilating
almost
as
if
he
were
a
hound
and
had
scented
his
quarry
i
sniffed
too
yes
there
was
a
faint
odour
almost
as
if
of
garlic
in
the
room
it
was
unmistakable
craig
was
looking
about
curiously
as
if
to
discover
a
window
by
which
the
odour
might
have
entered
brixton
with
his
eyes
following
keenly
every
move
noticed
him
more
than
that
he
added
quickly
i
have
had
the
most
perfect
system
of
modern
ventilation
installed
in
this
room
absolutely
independent
from
that
in
the
house
kennedy
said
nothing
a
moment
ago
kennedy
i
saw
you
and
jameson
glancing
up
at
the
ceiling
as
this
room
is
or
as
i
believe
it
to
be
i
i
hear
voices
voices
from
not
through
you
understand
but
from
that
very
ceiling
i
do
not
hear
them
now
it
is
only
at
certain
times
when
i
am
alone
they
repeat
the
words
in
some
of
these
letters
must
not
take
up
those
bonds
you
must
not
endanger
the
peace
of
the
world
you
will
never
live
to
get
the
interest
over
and
over
i
have
heard
such
sentences
spoken
in
this
very
room
i
have
rushed
out
and
up
the
corridor
there
has
been
no
one
there
i
have
locked
the
steel
door
still
i
have
heard
the
voices
and
it
is
absolutely
impossible
that
a
human
being
could
get
close
enough
to
say
them
without
my
knowing
and
finding
out
where
he
is
kennedy
betrayed
by
not
so
much
as
the
motion
of
a
muscle
even
a
shade
of
a
doubt
of
brixton
incredible
story
whether
because
he
believed
it
or
because
he
was
diplomatic
craig
took
the
thing
at
its
face
value
he
moved
a
blotter
so
that
he
could
stand
on
the
top
of
brixton
desk
in
the
centre
of
the
room
then
he
unfastened
and
took
down
the
glass
hemisphere
over
the
light
it
is
an
osram
lamp
of
about
a
hundred
candlepower
i
should
judge
he
observed
apparently
he
had
satisfied
himself
that
there
was
nothing
concealed
in
the
light
itself
laboriously
with
such
assistance
as
the
memory
of
brixton
could
give
he
began
tracing
out
the
course
of
both
the
electric
light
and
telephone
wires
that
led
down
into
the
den
next
came
a
close
examination
of
the
ceiling
and
side
walls
the
floor
the
hangings
the
pictures
the
rugs
everything
kennedy
was
tapping
here
and
there
all
over
the
wall
as
if
to
discover
whether
there
was
any
such
hollow
sound
as
a
cavity
might
make
there
was
none
a
low
exclamation
from
him
attracted
my
attention
though
it
escaped
brixton
his
tapping
had
raised
the
dust
from
the
velvety
wherever
he
had
tried
it
hastily
from
a
corner
where
it
would
not
be
noticed
he
pulled
off
a
piece
of
the
paper
and
stuffed
it
into
his
pocket
then
followed
a
hasty
examination
of
the
intake
of
the
ventilating
apparatus
apparently
satisfied
with
his
examination
of
things
in
the
den
craig
now
prepared
to
trace
out
the
course
of
the
telephone
and
light
wires
in
the
house
brixton
excused
himself
asking
us
to
join
him
in
the
library
after
craig
had
completed
his
investigation
nothing
was
discovered
by
tracing
the
lines
back
as
best
we
could
from
the
den
kennedy
therefore
began
at
the
other
end
and
having
found
the
points
in
the
huge
cellar
of
the
house
where
the
main
trunk
and
feed
wires
entered
he
began
a
systematic
search
in
that
direction
a
separate
line
led
apparently
to
the
den
and
where
this
line
feeding
the
osram
lamp
passed
near
a
dark
storeroom
in
a
corner
craig
examined
more
closely
than
ever
seemingly
his
search
was
rewarded
for
he
dived
into
the
dark
storeroom
and
commenced
lighting
matches
furiously
to
discover
what
was
there
look
walter
he
exclaimed
holding
a
match
so
that
i
could
see
what
he
had
unearthed
there
in
a
corner
concealed
by
an
old
chest
of
drawers
stood
a
battery
of
five
connected
with
an
instrument
that
looked
very
much
like
a
telephone
transmitter
a
rheostat
and
a
small
transformer
coil
i
suppose
this
is
a
lighting
circuit
he
remarked
thoughtfully
regarding
his
find
i
think
i
know
what
this
is
all
right
any
amateur
could
do
it
with
a
little
knowledge
of
electricity
and
a
source
of
direct
current
the
thing
is
easily
constructed
the
materials
are
common
and
a
wonderfully
complicated
result
can
be
obtained
what
this
he
had
continued
to
poke
about
in
the
darkness
as
he
was
speaking
in
another
corner
he
had
discovered
two
ordinary
telephone
receivers
connected
up
with
something
too
by
george
he
ejaculated
evidently
some
one
had
tapped
the
regular
telephone
wires
running
into
the
house
had
run
extensions
into
the
little
storeroom
and
was
prepared
to
overhear
everything
that
was
said
either
to
or
by
those
in
the
house
further
examination
disclosed
that
there
were
two
separate
telephone
systems
running
into
brixton
house
one
with
its
many
extensions
was
used
by
the
household
and
by
the
housekeeper
the
other
was
the
private
wire
which
led
ultimately
down
into
brixton
den
no
sooner
had
he
discovered
it
than
kennedy
became
intensely
interested
for
the
moment
he
seemed
entirely
to
forget
the
wires
and
became
absorbed
in
tracing
out
the
course
of
the
telephone
and
its
extensions
continued
search
rewarded
him
with
the
discovery
that
both
the
household
line
and
the
private
line
were
connected
by
hastily
improvised
extensions
with
the
two
receivers
he
had
discovered
in
the
corner
of
a
little
dark
storeroom
do
disturb
a
thing
remarked
kennedy
cautiously
picking
up
even
the
burnt
matches
he
had
dropped
in
his
hasty
search
we
must
devise
some
means
of
catching
the
eavesdropper
red
handed
it
has
all
the
marks
of
being
an
inside
job
we
had
completed
our
investigation
of
the
basement
without
attracting
any
attention
and
craig
was
careful
to
make
it
seem
that
in
entering
the
library
we
came
from
the
den
not
from
the
cellar
as
we
waited
in
the
big
leather
chairs
kennedy
was
sketching
roughly
on
a
sheet
of
paper
the
plan
of
the
house
drawing
in
the
location
of
the
various
wires
the
door
opened
we
had
expected
john
brixton
instead
a
tall
spare
foreigner
with
a
moustache
entered
i
knew
at
once
that
it
must
be
count
wachtmann
although
i
had
never
seen
him
ah
i
beg
your
pardon
he
exclaimed
in
english
which
betrayed
that
he
had
been
under
good
teachers
in
london
i
thought
miss
brixton
was
here
count
wachtmann
interrogated
kennedy
rising
the
same
he
replied
easily
with
a
glance
of
inquiry
at
us
my
friend
and
i
are
from
the
star
said
kennedy
ah
gentlemen
of
the
press
he
elevated
his
eyebrows
the
fraction
of
an
inch
it
was
so
politely
contemptuous
that
i
could
almost
have
throttled
him
we
are
waiting
to
see
brixton
explained
kennedy
what
is
the
latest
from
the
near
east
wachtmann
asked
with
the
air
of
a
man
expecting
to
hear
what
he
could
have
told
you
yesterday
if
he
had
chosen
there
was
a
movement
of
the
portieres
and
a
woman
entered
she
stopped
a
moment
i
knew
it
was
miss
brixton
she
had
recognised
kennedy
but
her
part
was
evidently
to
treat
him
as
a
total
stranger
who
are
these
men
conrad
she
asked
turning
to
wachtmann
gentlemen
of
the
press
i
believe
to
see
your
father
yvonne
replied
the
count
it
was
evident
that
it
had
not
been
mere
newspaper
talk
about
this
latest
rumored
international
engagement
how
did
you
enjoy
it
he
asked
noticing
the
title
of
a
history
which
she
had
come
to
replace
in
the
library
very
well
all
but
the
assassinations
and
the
intrigues
she
replied
with
a
little
shudder
he
shot
a
quick
searching
look
at
her
face
they
are
a
violent
people
some
of
them
he
commented
quickly
you
are
going
into
town
i
heard
him
ask
miss
brixton
as
they
walked
slowly
down
the
wide
hall
to
the
conservatory
a
few
moments
later
what
do
you
think
of
him
i
whispered
to
kennedy
i
suppose
my
native
distrust
of
his
kind
showed
through
for
craig
merely
shrugged
his
shoulders
before
he
could
reply
brixton
joined
us
there
another
one
just
came
he
ejaculated
throwing
a
letter
down
on
the
library
table
it
was
only
a
few
lines
this
time
the
bonds
will
not
be
subject
to
a
tax
by
the
government
they
say
no
because
if
there
is
a
war
there
wo
be
any
government
to
tax
them
the
note
did
not
appear
to
interest
kennedy
as
much
as
what
he
had
discovered
one
thing
is
brixton
he
remarked
some
one
inside
this
house
is
spying
is
in
constant
communication
with
a
person
or
persons
outside
all
the
watchmen
and
great
danes
on
the
estate
are
of
no
avail
against
the
subtle
underground
connection
that
i
believe
exists
it
is
still
early
in
the
afternoon
i
shall
make
a
hasty
trip
to
new
york
and
return
after
dinner
i
should
like
to
watch
with
you
in
the
den
this
evening
very
well
agreed
brixton
i
shall
arrange
to
have
you
met
at
the
station
and
brought
here
as
secretly
as
i
can
he
sighed
as
if
admitting
that
he
was
no
longer
master
of
even
his
own
house
kennedy
was
silent
during
most
of
our
return
trip
to
new
york
as
for
myself
i
was
deeply
mired
in
an
attempt
to
fathom
wachtmann
he
baffled
me
however
i
felt
that
if
there
was
indeed
some
subtle
underground
connection
between
some
one
inside
and
someone
outside
brixton
house
craig
would
prepare
an
equally
subtle
method
of
meeting
it
on
his
own
account
very
little
was
said
by
either
of
us
on
the
journey
up
to
the
laboratory
or
on
the
return
to
woodrock
i
realised
that
there
was
very
little
excuse
for
a
commuter
not
to
be
well
informed
i
at
least
had
plenty
of
time
to
exhaust
the
newspapers
i
had
bought
whether
or
not
we
returned
without
being
observed
i
did
not
know
but
at
least
we
did
find
that
the
basement
and
dark
storeroom
were
deserted
as
we
cautiously
made
our
way
again
it
to
the
corner
where
craig
had
made
his
enigmatical
discoveries
of
the
afternoon
while
i
held
a
pocket
flashlight
craig
was
busy
concealing
another
instrument
of
his
own
in
the
little
storeroom
it
seemed
to
be
a
little
black
disk
about
as
big
as
a
watch
with
a
number
of
perforated
holes
in
one
face
carelessly
he
tossed
it
into
the
top
drawer
of
the
chest
under
some
old
rubbish
shut
the
drawer
tight
and
ran
a
flexible
wire
out
of
the
back
of
the
chest
it
was
a
simple
matter
to
lay
the
wire
through
some
bins
next
the
storeroom
and
then
around
to
the
passageway
down
to
the
subterranean
den
of
brixton
there
craig
deposited
a
little
black
box
about
the
size
of
an
ordinary
kodak
for
an
hour
or
so
we
sat
with
brixton
neither
of
us
said
anything
and
brixton
was
uncommunicatively
engaged
in
reading
a
railroad
report
suddenly
a
sort
of
muttering
singing
noise
seemed
to
fill
the
room
there
it
is
cried
brixton
clapping
the
book
shut
and
looking
eagerly
at
kennedy
gradually
the
sound
increased
in
pitch
it
seemed
to
come
from
the
ceiling
not
from
any
particular
part
of
the
room
but
merely
from
somewhere
overhead
there
was
no
hallucination
about
it
we
all
heard
as
the
vibrations
increased
it
was
evident
that
they
were
shaping
themselves
into
words
kennedy
had
grasped
the
black
box
the
moment
the
sound
began
and
was
holding
two
black
rubber
disks
to
his
ears
at
last
the
sound
from
overhead
became
articulate
it
was
weird
uncanny
suddenly
a
voice
said
distinctly
let
american
dollars
beware
they
will
not
protect
american
daughters
craig
had
dropped
the
two
and
was
gazing
intently
at
the
osram
lamp
in
the
ceiling
was
he
too
crazy
here
brixton
take
these
two
receivers
of
the
detectaphone
said
kennedy
tell
me
whether
you
can
recognise
the
voice
why
it
familiar
he
remarked
slowly
i
ca
place
it
but
heard
it
before
where
is
it
what
is
this
thing
anyhow
it
is
someone
hidden
in
the
storeroom
in
the
basement
answered
craig
he
is
talking
into
a
very
sensitive
telephone
transmitter
and
but
the
voice
here
interrupted
brixton
impatiently
kennedy
pointed
to
the
incandescent
lamp
in
the
ceiling
the
incandescent
lamp
he
said
is
not
always
the
mute
electrical
apparatus
it
is
supposed
to
be
under
the
right
conditions
it
can
be
made
to
speak
exactly
as
the
famous
as
it
was
called
by
professor
duddell
who
investigated
it
both
the
and
the
lamp
can
be
made
to
act
as
telephone
receivers
it
seemed
unbelievable
but
kennedy
was
positive
in
the
case
of
the
or
as
it
might
be
called
he
continued
the
fact
that
the
electric
arc
is
sensitive
to
such
small
variations
in
the
current
over
a
wide
range
of
frequency
has
suggested
that
a
arc
might
be
used
as
a
telephone
receiver
all
that
is
necessary
is
to
superimpose
a
microphone
current
on
the
main
arc
current
and
the
arc
reproduces
sounds
and
speech
distinctly
loud
enough
to
be
heard
several
feet
indeed
the
arc
could
be
used
as
a
transmitter
too
if
a
sensitive
receiver
replaced
the
transmitter
at
the
other
end
the
things
needed
are
an
an
impedance
coil
or
small
a
rheostat
and
a
source
of
energy
the
alternating
current
is
not
adapted
to
reproduce
speech
but
the
ordinary
direct
current
is
of
course
the
theory
is
half
as
simple
as
the
apparatus
i
have
described
he
had
unscrewed
the
osram
lamp
the
talking
ceased
immediately
two
investigators
named
ort
and
ridger
have
used
a
lamp
like
this
as
a
receiver
he
continued
they
found
that
words
spoken
were
reproduced
in
the
lamp
the
telephonic
current
variations
superposed
on
the
current
passing
through
the
lamp
produce
corresponding
variations
of
heat
in
the
filament
which
are
radiated
to
the
glass
of
the
bulb
causing
it
to
expand
and
contract
proportionately
and
thus
transmitting
vibrations
to
the
exterior
air
of
course
in
lamps
the
glass
is
too
thick
and
the
heat
variations
are
too
feeble
who
was
it
whose
voice
brixton
had
recognised
as
familiar
over
kennedy
hastily
installed
detectaphone
certainly
he
must
have
been
a
scientist
of
no
mean
attainment
that
did
not
surprise
me
for
i
realised
that
from
that
part
of
europe
where
this
mystical
red
brotherhood
operated
some
of
the
most
famous
scientists
of
the
world
had
sprung
a
hasty
excursion
into
the
basement
netted
us
nothing
the
place
was
deserted
we
could
only
wait
with
parting
instructions
to
brixton
in
the
use
of
the
detectaphone
we
said
good
night
were
met
by
a
watchman
and
escorted
as
far
as
the
lodge
safely
only
one
remark
did
kennedy
make
as
we
settled
ourselves
for
the
long
ride
in
the
accommodation
train
to
the
city
that
warning
means
that
we
have
two
people
to
protect
both
brixton
and
his
daughter
speculate
as
i
might
i
could
find
no
answer
to
the
mystery
nor
to
the
question
which
was
also
unsolved
as
to
the
queer
malady
of
brixton
himself
which
his
physician
diagnosed
as
jaundice
vi
the
detectaphone
far
after
midnight
though
it
had
been
when
we
had
at
last
turned
in
at
our
apartment
kennedy
was
up
even
earlier
than
usual
in
the
morning
i
found
him
engrossed
in
work
at
the
laboratory
just
in
time
to
see
whether
i
right
in
my
guess
about
the
illness
of
brixton
he
remarked
scarcely
looking
up
at
me
he
had
taken
a
flask
with
a
rubber
stopper
through
one
hole
in
it
was
fitted
a
long
funnel
through
another
ran
a
glass
tube
connecting
with
a
large
filled
with
calcium
chloride
which
in
turn
connected
with
a
long
open
tube
with
an
end
into
the
flask
craig
dropped
some
pure
granulated
zinc
coated
with
platinum
then
he
covered
it
with
dilute
sulphuric
acid
through
the
funnel
tube
that
forms
hydrogen
gas
he
explained
which
passes
through
the
and
the
wait
a
moment
until
all
the
air
is
expelled
from
the
tubes
he
lighted
a
match
and
touched
it
to
the
open
upturned
end
the
hydrogen
now
escaping
freely
was
ignited
with
a
flame
next
he
took
the
little
piece
of
i
had
seen
him
tear
off
in
the
den
scraped
off
some
powder
from
it
dissolved
it
and
poured
it
into
the
almost
immediately
the
pale
bluish
flame
turned
to
bluish
white
and
white
fumes
were
formed
in
the
a
sort
of
metallic
deposit
appeared
quickly
he
made
one
test
after
another
i
sniffed
there
was
an
unmistakable
smell
of
garlic
in
the
air
arseniureted
hydrogen
commented
craig
this
is
the
marsh
test
for
arsenic
that
in
brixton
den
has
been
loaded
down
with
arsenic
probably
paris
green
or
schweinfurth
green
which
is
of
copper
every
minute
he
is
there
he
is
breathing
arseniureted
hydrogen
some
one
has
contrived
to
introduce
free
hydrogen
into
the
intake
of
his
ventilator
that
acts
on
the
arsenic
compounds
in
the
and
hangings
and
sets
free
the
gas
i
thought
i
knew
the
smell
the
moment
i
got
a
whiff
of
it
besides
i
could
tell
by
the
jaundiced
look
of
his
face
that
he
was
being
poisoned
his
liver
was
out
of
order
and
arsenic
seems
to
accumulate
in
the
liver
slowly
poisoned
by
minute
quantities
of
gas
i
repeated
in
amazement
some
one
in
that
red
brotherhood
is
a
diabolical
genius
think
of
it
poisoned
it
was
still
early
in
the
forenoon
when
kennedy
excused
himself
and
leaving
me
to
my
own
devices
disappeared
on
one
of
his
excursions
into
the
underworld
of
the
foreign
settlements
on
the
east
side
about
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
he
reappeared
as
far
as
i
could
learn
all
that
he
had
found
out
was
that
the
famous
or
rather
infamous
professor
michael
kumanova
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
red
brotherhood
was
known
to
be
somewhere
in
this
country
we
lost
no
time
in
returning
again
to
woodrock
late
that
afternoon
craig
hastened
to
warn
brixton
of
his
peril
from
the
contaminated
atmosphere
of
the
den
and
at
once
a
servant
was
set
to
work
with
a
vacuum
cleaner
carefully
craig
reconnoitred
the
basement
where
the
eavesdropping
storeroom
was
situated
finding
it
deserted
he
quickly
set
to
work
connecting
the
two
wires
of
the
general
household
telephone
with
what
looked
very
much
like
a
seamless
iron
tube
perhaps
six
inches
long
and
three
inches
in
diameter
then
he
connected
the
tube
also
with
the
private
wire
of
brixton
in
a
similar
manner
this
is
a
special
of
high
efficiency
he
explained
in
answer
to
my
inquiry
it
is
absolutely
balanced
as
to
resistance
number
of
turns
and
everything
i
shall
run
this
third
line
from
the
coil
into
brixton
den
and
then
if
you
like
you
can
accompany
me
on
a
little
excursion
down
to
the
village
where
i
am
going
to
install
another
similar
coil
between
the
two
lines
at
the
local
telephone
central
station
opposite
the
railroad
brixton
met
us
about
eight
that
night
in
his
now
renovated
den
apparently
even
the
little
change
from
uncertainty
to
certainty
so
far
had
had
a
tonic
effect
on
him
i
had
however
almost
given
up
the
illusion
that
it
was
possible
for
us
to
be
even
in
the
den
without
being
watched
by
an
unseen
eye
it
seemed
to
me
that
to
one
who
could
conceive
of
talking
through
an
incandescent
lamp
seeing
even
through
steel
and
masonry
was
not
impossible
kennedy
had
brought
with
him
a
rectangular
box
of
oak
in
one
of
the
large
faces
of
which
were
two
square
boles
as
he
replaced
the
black
box
of
the
detectaphone
with
this
oak
box
he
remarked
this
is
an
intercommunicating
telephone
arrangement
of
the
detectaphone
you
see
it
is
more
sensitive
than
anything
of
the
sort
ever
made
before
the
arrangement
of
these
little
square
holes
is
such
as
to
make
them
act
as
horns
or
magnifiers
of
a
double
receiver
we
can
all
hear
at
once
what
is
going
on
by
using
this
machine
we
had
not
been
waiting
long
before
a
peculiar
noise
seemed
to
issue
from
the
detectaphone
it
was
as
though
a
door
had
been
opened
and
shut
hastily
some
one
had
evidently
entered
the
storeroom
a
voice
called
up
the
railroad
station
and
asked
for
michael
kronski
count
wachtmann
chauffeur
it
is
the
voice
i
heard
last
night
exclaimed
brixton
by
the
lord
harry
do
you
know
it
is
janeff
the
engineer
who
has
charge
of
the
steam
heating
the
electric
bells
and
everything
of
the
sort
around
the
place
my
own
engineer
i
land
the
fellow
in
jail
before
i
kennedy
raised
his
hand
let
us
hear
what
he
has
to
say
remonstrated
craig
calmly
i
suppose
you
have
wondered
why
i
did
just
go
down
there
last
night
and
grab
the
fellow
well
you
see
now
it
is
my
invariable
rule
to
get
the
man
highest
up
this
fellow
is
only
one
tool
arrest
him
and
as
likely
as
not
we
should
allow
the
big
criminal
to
escape
hello
kronski
came
over
the
detectaphone
this
is
janeff
how
are
things
going
wachtmann
chauffeur
must
have
answered
that
everything
was
all
right
you
knew
that
they
had
discovered
the
poisoned
asked
janeff
a
long
parley
followed
finally
janeff
repeated
what
apparently
had
been
his
instructions
now
let
me
see
he
said
you
want
me
to
stay
here
until
the
last
minute
so
that
i
can
overhear
whether
any
alarm
is
given
for
her
all
right
you
sure
it
is
the
train
she
is
due
on
very
well
i
shall
meet
you
at
the
ferry
across
the
hudson
i
start
from
here
as
soon
as
i
hear
the
train
come
in
we
get
the
girl
this
time
that
will
bring
brixton
to
terms
sure
you
right
even
if
we
fail
this
time
we
succeed
later
do
fail
me
i
be
at
the
ferry
as
soon
as
i
can
get
past
the
guards
and
join
you
there
is
a
chance
of
an
alarm
from
the
house
i
cut
all
the
wires
the
last
thing
before
i
leave
all
at
once
it
dawned
on
me
what
they
were
planning
the
kidnapping
of
brixton
only
daughter
to
hold
her
perhaps
as
a
hostage
until
he
did
the
bidding
of
the
gang
wachtmann
chauffeur
was
doing
it
and
using
wachtmann
car
too
was
wachtmann
a
party
to
it
what
was
to
be
done
i
looked
at
my
watch
it
was
already
only
a
couple
of
minutes
of
nine
when
the
train
would
be
due
if
we
could
seize
that
fellow
in
the
closet
and
start
for
the
station
immediately
we
might
save
yvonne
cried
brixton
starting
for
the
door
and
if
they
escape
you
make
them
more
eager
than
ever
to
strike
a
blow
at
you
and
yours
put
in
craig
coolly
no
let
us
get
this
thing
straight
i
did
think
it
was
as
serious
as
this
but
i
prepared
to
meet
any
emergency
but
man
shouted
brixton
you
do
suppose
anything
in
the
world
counts
beside
her
do
you
exactly
the
point
urged
craig
save
her
and
capture
them
both
at
once
how
can
you
fumed
brixton
if
you
attempt
to
telephone
from
here
that
fellow
janeff
will
overhear
and
give
a
warning
regardless
of
whether
janeff
was
listening
or
not
kennedy
was
eagerly
telephoning
to
the
woodrock
central
down
in
the
village
he
was
using
the
transmitter
and
receiver
that
were
connected
with
the
iron
tube
which
he
had
connected
to
the
two
regular
house
lines
have
the
ferry
held
at
any
cost
he
was
ordering
do
let
the
next
boat
go
out
until
brixton
gets
there
under
any
circumstances
now
put
that
to
them
straight
central
you
know
brixton
has
just
a
little
bit
of
influence
around
here
and
somebody
head
will
drop
if
they
let
that
boat
go
out
before
he
gets
there
humph
ejaculated
brixton
much
good
that
will
do
why
i
suppose
our
friend
janeff
down
in
the
storeroom
knows
it
all
now
come
on
let
grab
him
nevertheless
there
was
no
sound
from
the
detectaphone
which
would
indicate
that
he
had
overheard
and
was
spreading
the
alarm
he
was
there
yet
for
we
could
hear
him
clear
his
throat
once
or
twice
no
replied
kennedy
calmly
he
knows
nothing
about
it
i
did
use
any
ordinary
means
to
prepare
against
the
experts
who
have
brought
this
situation
about
that
message
you
heard
me
send
went
out
over
what
we
call
the
circuit
the
phantom
circuit
repeated
brixton
chafing
at
the
delay
yes
it
seems
fantastic
at
first
i
suppose
pursued
kennedy
calmly
but
after
all
it
is
in
accordance
with
the
laws
of
electricity
no
use
fretting
and
fuming
brixton
if
janeff
can
wait
we
have
to
do
so
too
suppose
we
should
start
and
this
kronski
should
change
his
plans
at
the
last
minute
how
would
we
find
it
out
by
telepathy
believe
me
sir
it
is
better
to
wait
here
a
minute
and
trust
to
the
phantom
circuit
than
to
mere
chance
but
suppose
he
should
cut
the
line
i
put
in
kennedy
smiled
i
have
provided
for
that
walter
in
the
way
i
installed
the
thing
i
took
good
care
that
we
could
not
be
cut
off
that
way
we
can
hear
everything
ourselves
but
we
can
not
be
overheard
he
knows
nothing
you
see
i
took
advantage
of
the
fact
that
additional
telephones
or
phantom
lines
can
be
superposed
on
existing
physical
lines
it
is
possible
to
obtain
a
third
circuit
from
two
similar
metallic
circuits
by
using
for
each
side
of
this
third
circuit
the
two
wires
of
each
of
the
other
circuits
in
multiple
all
three
circuits
are
independent
too
the
third
telephone
current
enters
the
wires
of
the
first
circuit
as
it
were
and
returns
along
the
wires
of
the
second
circuit
there
are
several
ways
of
doing
it
one
is
to
use
retardation
or
bridged
across
the
two
metallic
circuits
at
both
ends
with
taps
taken
from
the
middle
points
of
each
but
the
more
desirable
method
is
the
one
you
saw
me
install
this
afternoon
i
introduced
into
the
circuits
at
both
ends
technically
the
third
circuit
is
then
taken
off
from
the
of
the
secondaries
or
line
windings
of
these
repeating
coils
the
current
on
a
line
is
alternating
in
character
and
it
passes
readily
through
a
the
only
effect
it
has
on
the
transmission
is
slightly
reducing
the
volume
the
current
passes
into
the
then
divides
and
passes
through
the
two
line
wires
at
the
other
end
the
halves
balance
so
to
speak
thus
currents
passing
over
a
phantom
circuit
do
set
up
currents
in
the
terminal
apparatus
of
the
side
circuits
consequently
a
conversation
carried
on
over
the
phantom
circuit
will
not
be
heard
in
either
side
circuit
nor
does
a
conversation
on
one
side
circuit
affect
the
phantom
we
could
all
talk
at
once
without
interfering
with
each
other
at
any
other
time
i
should
be
more
than
interested
remarked
brixton
grimly
curbing
his
impatience
to
be
doing
something
i
appreciate
that
sir
rejoined
kennedy
ah
here
it
is
i
have
the
central
down
in
the
village
yes
they
will
hold
the
boat
for
us
good
thank
you
the
train
is
five
minutes
late
yes
what
count
wachtmann
car
is
there
oh
yes
the
train
is
just
pulling
in
i
see
miss
brixton
has
entered
his
car
alone
what
that
his
chauffeur
has
started
the
car
without
waiting
for
the
count
who
is
coming
down
the
platform
instantly
kennedy
was
on
his
feet
he
was
dashing
up
the
corridor
and
the
stairs
from
the
den
and
down
into
the
basement
to
the
little
storeroom
we
burst
into
the
place
it
was
empty
janeff
had
cut
the
wires
and
fled
there
was
not
a
moment
to
lose
craig
hastily
made
sure
that
he
had
not
discovered
or
injured
the
phantom
circuit
call
the
fastest
car
you
have
in
your
garage
brixton
ordered
kennedy
hello
hello
central
get
the
lodge
at
the
brixton
estate
tell
them
if
they
see
the
engineer
janeff
going
out
to
stop
him
alarm
the
watchman
and
have
the
dogs
ready
catch
him
at
any
cost
dead
or
alive
a
moment
later
brixton
car
raced
around
and
we
piled
in
and
were
off
like
a
whirlwind
already
we
could
see
lights
moving
about
and
hear
the
baying
of
dogs
personally
i
would
have
given
much
for
chances
of
escape
as
we
turned
the
bend
in
the
road
just
before
we
reached
the
ferry
we
almost
ran
into
two
cars
standing
before
the
ferry
house
it
looked
as
though
one
had
run
squarely
in
front
of
the
other
and
blocked
it
off
in
the
slip
the
ferry
boat
was
still
steaming
and
waiting
beside
the
wrecked
car
a
man
was
lying
on
the
ground
groaning
while
another
man
was
quieting
a
girl
whom
he
was
leading
to
the
of
the
ferry
brixton
weak
though
he
was
from
his
illness
leaped
out
of
our
car
almost
before
we
stopped
and
caught
the
girl
in
his
arms
father
she
exclaimed
clinging
to
him
what
this
he
demanded
sternly
eying
the
man
it
was
wachtmann
himself
conrad
saved
me
from
that
chauffeur
of
his
explained
miss
brixton
i
met
him
on
the
train
and
we
were
going
to
ride
up
to
the
house
together
but
before
conrad
could
get
into
the
car
this
fellow
who
had
the
engine
running
started
it
conrad
jumped
into
another
car
that
was
waiting
at
the
station
he
overlook
us
and
dodged
in
front
so
as
to
cut
the
chauffeur
off
from
the
ferry
curse
that
villain
of
a
chauffeur
muttered
wachtmann
looking
down
at
the
wounded
man
do
you
know
who
he
is
asked
craig
with
a
searching
glance
at
wachtmann
face
i
ought
to
his
name
is
kronski
and
a
blacker
devil
an
employment
bureau
never
furnished
kronski
no
corrected
kennedy
it
is
professor
kumanova
whom
you
perhaps
have
heard
of
as
a
leader
of
the
red
brotherhood
one
of
the
cleverest
scientific
criminals
who
ever
lived
i
think
you
have
no
more
trouble
negotiating
your
loan
or
your
love
affair
count
added
craig
turning
on
his
heel
he
was
in
no
mood
to
receive
the
congratulations
of
the
supercilious
wachtmann
as
far
as
craig
was
concerned
the
case
was
finished
although
i
fancied
from
a
flicker
of
his
eye
as
he
made
some
passing
reference
to
the
outcome
that
when
he
came
to
send
in
a
bill
to
brixton
for
his
services
he
would
not
forget
the
high
eyebrowed
count
i
followed
in
silence
as
craig
climbed
into
the
brixton
car
and
explained
to
the
banker
that
it
was
imperative
that
he
should
get
back
to
the
city
immediately
nothing
would
do
but
that
the
car
must
take
us
all
the
way
back
while
brixton
summoned
another
from
the
house
for
himself
the
ride
was
accomplished
swiftly
in
record
time
kennedy
said
little
apparently
the
exhilaration
of
the
of
cool
air
was
quite
in
keeping
with
his
mood
though
for
my
part
i
should
have
preferred
something
a
little
more
relaxing
of
the
nervous
tension
we
been
at
it
five
days
now
i
remarked
wearily
as
i
dropped
into
an
easy
chair
in
our
own
quarters
are
you
going
to
keep
up
this
debauch
kennedy
laughed
no
he
said
with
a
twinkle
of
scientific
mischief
no
i
going
to
sleep
it
off
thank
heaven
i
muttered
because
he
went
on
seriously
that
case
interrupted
a
long
series
of
tests
i
am
making
on
the
sensitiveness
of
selenium
to
light
and
i
want
to
finish
them
up
soon
there
no
telling
when
i
shall
be
called
on
to
use
the
information
i
swallowed
hard
he
really
meant
it
he
was
laying
out
more
work
for
himself
next
morning
i
fully
expected
to
find
that
he
had
gone
instead
he
was
preparing
for
what
he
called
a
quiet
day
in
the
laboratory
now
for
some
real
work
he
smiled
sometimes
walter
i
feel
that
i
ought
to
give
up
this
outside
activity
and
devote
myself
entirely
to
research
it
is
so
much
more
important
i
could
only
stare
at
him
and
reflect
on
how
often
men
wanted
to
do
something
other
than
the
very
thing
that
nature
had
evidently
intended
them
to
do
and
on
how
fortunate
it
was
that
we
were
not
always
free
agents
he
set
out
for
the
laboratory
and
i
determined
that
as
long
as
he
would
not
stop
working
neither
would
i
tried
to
write
somehow
i
was
not
in
the
mood
i
wrote
at
my
story
but
succeeded
only
in
making
it
more
unintelligible
i
was
in
no
fit
condition
for
it
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
use
force
if
necessary
to
separate
kennedy
from
his
study
of
selenium
my
idea
was
that
anything
from
the
metropolitan
to
the
movies
would
do
him
good
and
i
had
almost
carried
my
point
when
a
big
severely
plain
black
foreign
limousine
pulled
up
with
a
rush
at
the
laboratory
door
a
large
man
in
a
huge
fur
coat
jumped
out
and
the
next
moment
strode
into
the
room
he
needed
no
introduction
for
we
recognised
at
once
perry
spencer
one
of
the
foremost
of
american
financiers
and
a
trustee
of
the
university
with
that
characteristic
directness
which
i
have
always
thought
accounted
in
large
measure
for
his
success
he
wasted
scarcely
a
word
in
coming
straight
to
the
object
of
his
visit
professor
kennedy
he
began
chewing
his
cigar
and
gazing
about
with
evident
interest
at
the
apparatus
craig
had
collected
in
his
warfare
of
science
with
crime
i
have
dropped
in
here
as
a
matter
of
patriotism
i
want
you
to
preserve
to
america
those
masterpieces
of
art
and
literature
which
i
have
collected
all
over
the
world
during
many
years
they
are
the
objects
of
one
of
the
most
curious
pieces
of
vandalism
of
which
i
have
ever
heard
professor
kennedy
he
concluded
earnestly
could
i
ask
you
to
call
on
hugo
lith
the
curator
of
my
private
museum
as
soon
as
you
can
possibly
find
it
convenient
most
assuredly
spencer
replied
craig
with
a
whimsical
side
glance
at
me
that
told
without
words
that
this
was
better
relaxation
to
him
than
either
the
metropolitan
or
the
movies
i
shall
be
glad
to
see
lith
at
any
time
right
now
if
it
is
convenient
to
him
the
millionaire
connoisseur
consulted
his
watch
lith
will
be
at
the
museum
until
six
at
least
yes
we
can
catch
him
there
i
have
a
dinner
engagement
at
seven
myself
i
can
give
you
half
an
hour
of
the
time
before
then
if
you
ready
just
jump
into
the
car
both
of
you
the
museum
to
which
he
referred
was
a
handsome
white
marble
building
in
renaissance
fronting
on
a
side
street
just
off
fifth
avenue
and
in
the
rear
of
the
famous
spencer
house
itself
one
of
the
show
places
of
that
wonderful
thoroughfare
spencer
had
built
the
museum
at
great
cost
simply
to
house
those
treasures
which
were
too
dear
to
him
to
entrust
to
a
public
institution
it
was
in
the
shape
of
a
rectangle
and
planned
with
special
care
as
to
the
lighting
lith
a
rather
stout
german
savant
plunged
directly
into
the
middle
of
things
as
soon
as
we
had
been
introduced
it
is
a
most
remarkable
affair
gentlemen
he
began
placing
for
us
chairs
that
must
have
been
hundreds
of
years
old
at
first
it
was
only
those
objects
in
the
museum
that
were
green
that
were
touched
like
the
collection
of
famous
and
historic
french
emeralds
but
soon
we
found
it
was
other
things
too
that
were
missing
old
roman
coins
of
gold
a
collection
of
watches
and
i
know
not
what
else
until
we
have
gone
over
the
where
is
miss
white
interrupted
spencer
who
had
been
listening
somewhat
impatiently
in
the
library
sir
shall
i
call
her
no
i
will
go
myself
i
want
her
to
tell
her
experience
to
professor
kennedy
exactly
as
she
told
it
to
me
explain
while
i
am
gone
how
impossible
it
would
be
for
a
visitor
to
do
one
to
say
nothing
of
all
of
the
acts
of
vandalism
we
have
discovered
vii
the
green
curse
the
american
medici
disappeared
into
his
main
library
where
miss
white
was
making
a
minute
examination
to
determine
what
damage
had
been
done
in
the
realm
over
which
she
presided
apparently
every
book
with
a
green
binding
has
been
mutilated
in
some
way
resumed
lith
but
that
was
only
the
beginning
others
have
suffered
too
and
some
are
even
gone
it
is
impossible
that
any
visitor
could
have
done
it
only
a
few
personal
friends
of
spencer
are
ever
admitted
here
and
they
are
never
alone
no
it
is
weird
mysterious
just
then
spencer
returned
with
miss
white
she
was
an
extremely
attractive
girl
slight
of
figure
but
with
an
air
about
her
that
all
the
imported
gowns
in
new
york
could
not
have
conferred
they
were
engaged
in
animated
conversation
so
much
in
contrast
with
the
bored
air
with
which
spencer
had
listened
to
lith
that
even
i
noticed
that
the
connoisseur
was
completely
obliterated
in
the
man
whose
love
of
beauty
was
by
no
means
confined
to
the
inanimate
i
wondered
if
it
was
merely
his
interest
in
her
story
that
impelled
spencer
the
more
i
watched
the
girl
the
more
i
was
convinced
that
she
knew
that
she
was
interesting
to
the
millionaire
for
example
lith
was
saying
the
famous
collection
of
emeralds
which
has
disappeared
has
always
been
what
you
americans
call
they
hare
always
brought
ill
luck
and
like
many
things
of
the
sort
to
which
superstition
attaches
they
have
been
so
to
speak
by
their
successive
owners
in
museums
are
they
salable
that
is
could
any
one
dispose
of
the
emeralds
or
the
other
curios
with
reasonable
safety
and
at
a
good
price
oh
yes
yes
hastened
lith
not
as
collections
but
separately
the
emeralds
alone
cost
fifty
thousand
dollars
i
believe
spencer
bought
them
for
spencer
some
years
before
she
died
she
did
not
care
to
wear
them
however
and
had
them
placed
here
i
thought
i
noticed
a
shade
of
annoyance
cross
the
face
of
the
magnate
never
mind
that
he
interrupted
let
me
introduce
miss
white
i
think
you
will
find
her
story
one
of
the
most
uncanny
you
have
ever
heard
he
had
placed
a
chair
for
her
and
still
addressing
us
but
looking
at
her
went
on
it
seems
that
the
morning
the
vandalism
was
first
discovered
she
and
lith
at
once
began
a
thorough
search
of
the
building
to
ascertain
the
extent
of
the
depredations
the
search
lasted
all
day
and
well
into
the
night
i
believe
it
was
midnight
before
you
finished
it
was
almost
twelve
began
the
girl
in
a
musical
voice
that
was
too
parisian
to
harmonize
with
her
plain
name
when
lith
was
down
here
in
his
office
checking
off
the
objects
in
the
catalogue
which
were
either
injured
or
missing
i
had
been
working
in
the
library
the
noise
of
something
like
a
shade
flapping
in
the
wind
attracted
my
attention
i
listened
it
seemed
to
come
from
the
a
large
room
where
some
of
the
greatest
masterpieces
in
this
country
are
hung
i
hurried
up
there
just
as
i
reached
the
door
a
strange
feeling
seemed
to
come
over
me
that
i
was
not
alone
in
that
room
i
fumbled
for
the
electric
light
switch
but
in
my
nervousness
could
not
find
it
there
was
just
enough
light
in
the
room
to
make
out
objects
indistinctly
i
thought
i
heard
a
low
moaning
sound
from
an
old
flemish
copper
ewer
near
me
i
had
heard
that
it
was
supposed
to
groan
at
night
she
paused
and
shuddered
at
her
recollection
and
looked
about
as
if
grateful
for
the
flood
of
electric
light
that
now
illuminated
everything
spencer
reached
over
and
touched
her
arm
to
encourage
her
to
go
on
she
did
not
seem
to
resent
the
touch
opposite
me
in
the
middle
of
the
open
floor
she
resumed
her
eyes
dilated
and
her
breath
coming
and
going
rapidly
stood
the
of
ka
an
egyptian
priestess
of
thebes
i
think
the
case
was
empty
but
on
the
lid
was
painted
a
picture
of
the
priestess
such
wonderful
eyes
they
seem
to
pierce
right
through
your
very
soul
often
in
the
daytime
i
have
stolen
off
to
look
at
them
but
at
night
remember
the
hour
of
night
too
oh
it
was
awful
terrible
the
lid
of
the
moved
yes
really
moved
and
seemed
to
float
to
one
side
i
could
see
it
and
back
of
that
carved
and
painted
face
with
the
piercing
eyes
was
another
face
a
real
face
real
eyes
and
they
looked
out
at
me
with
such
hatred
from
the
place
that
i
knew
was
empty
she
had
risen
and
was
facing
us
with
wild
terror
written
on
her
face
as
if
in
appeal
for
protection
against
something
she
was
powerless
to
name
spencer
who
had
not
taken
his
hand
off
her
arm
gently
pressed
her
back
into
the
easy
chair
and
finished
the
story
she
screamed
and
fainted
lith
heard
it
and
rushed
there
she
lay
on
the
floor
the
lid
of
the
sarcophagus
had
really
been
moved
he
saw
it
not
a
thing
else
had
been
disturbed
he
carried
her
down
here
and
revived
her
told
her
to
rest
for
a
day
or
two
but
i
can
not
i
can
not
she
cried
it
is
the
fascination
of
the
thing
it
brings
me
back
here
i
dream
of
it
i
thought
i
saw
those
eyes
the
other
night
they
haunt
me
i
fear
them
and
yet
i
would
not
avoid
them
if
it
killed
me
to
look
i
must
meet
and
defy
the
power
what
is
it
is
it
a
curse
four
thousand
years
old
that
has
fallen
on
me
i
had
heard
stories
of
mummies
that
rose
from
their
sleep
of
centuries
to
tell
the
fate
of
some
one
when
it
was
hanging
in
the
balance
of
mummies
that
groaned
and
gurgled
and
fought
for
breath
frantically
beating
with
their
swathed
hands
in
the
witching
hours
of
the
night
and
i
knew
that
the
lure
of
these
mummies
was
so
strong
for
some
people
that
they
were
drawn
irresistibly
to
look
upon
and
confer
with
them
was
this
a
case
for
the
oculists
the
spiritualists
the
egyptologists
or
for
a
detective
i
should
like
to
examine
the
art
gallery
in
fact
go
over
the
whole
museum
put
in
kennedy
in
his
most
tone
spencer
with
a
glance
at
his
watch
excused
himself
nodding
to
lith
to
show
us
about
and
with
a
good
night
to
miss
white
which
was
noticeable
for
its
sympathy
with
her
fears
said
i
shall
be
at
the
house
for
another
at
least
in
case
anything
really
important
develops
a
few
minutes
later
miss
white
left
for
the
night
with
apparent
reluctance
and
yet
i
thought
with
just
a
little
shudder
as
she
looked
back
up
the
staircase
that
led
to
the
lith
led
us
into
a
large
vaulted
marble
hall
and
up
a
broad
flight
of
steps
past
beautiful
carvings
and
frescoes
that
i
should
have
liked
to
stop
and
admire
the
was
a
long
room
in
the
interior
and
at
the
top
of
the
building
windowless
but
lighted
by
a
huge
double
skylight
each
half
of
which
must
have
been
some
eight
or
ten
feet
across
the
light
falling
through
this
skylight
passed
through
plate
glass
of
marvellous
transparency
one
looked
up
at
the
sky
as
if
through
the
air
itself
kennedy
ignored
the
gallery
profusion
of
priceless
art
for
the
time
and
went
directly
to
the
of
the
priestess
ka
it
has
a
weird
history
remarked
lith
no
less
than
seven
deaths
as
well
as
many
accidents
have
been
attributed
to
the
malign
influence
of
that
greenish
yellow
coffin
you
know
the
ancient
egyptians
used
to
chant
as
they
buried
their
sacred
dead
to
him
who
injures
the
tomb
the
dead
shall
point
out
the
evildoer
to
the
devourer
of
the
underworld
soul
and
body
shall
be
destroyed
it
was
indeed
an
awesome
thing
it
represented
a
woman
in
the
robes
of
an
egyptian
priestess
a
woman
of
medium
height
with
an
inscrutable
face
the
slanting
egyptian
eyes
did
as
miss
white
had
said
almost
literally
stare
through
you
i
am
sure
that
any
one
possessing
a
nature
at
all
affected
by
such
things
might
after
a
few
minutes
gazing
at
them
in
really
convince
himself
that
the
eyes
moved
and
were
real
even
as
i
turned
and
looked
the
other
way
i
felt
that
those
penetrating
eyes
were
still
looking
at
me
never
asleep
always
keen
and
searching
there
was
no
awe
about
kennedy
he
carefully
pushed
aside
the
lid
and
peered
inside
i
almost
expected
to
see
some
one
in
there
a
moment
later
he
pulled
out
his
and
carefully
examined
the
interior
at
last
he
was
apparently
satisfied
with
his
search
he
had
narrowed
his
attention
down
to
a
few
marks
on
the
stone
partly
in
the
thin
layer
of
dust
that
had
collected
on
the
bottom
this
was
a
very
modern
and
material
reincarnation
he
remarked
as
he
rose
if
i
am
not
mistaken
the
apparition
wore
shoes
shoes
with
nails
in
the
heels
and
nails
that
are
not
like
those
in
american
shoes
i
shall
have
to
compare
the
marks
i
have
found
with
marks
i
have
copied
from
in
the
wonderful
collection
of
bertillon
offhand
i
should
say
that
the
shoes
were
of
french
make
the
library
having
been
gone
over
next
without
anything
attracting
kennedy
attention
particularly
he
asked
about
the
basement
or
cellar
lith
lighted
the
way
and
we
descended
down
there
were
innumerable
huge
which
had
just
arrived
from
abroad
full
of
the
latest
consignment
of
art
treasures
which
spencer
had
purchased
apparently
lith
and
miss
white
had
been
so
engrossed
in
discovering
what
damage
had
been
done
to
the
art
treasures
above
that
they
had
not
had
time
to
examine
the
new
ones
in
the
basement
kennedy
first
move
was
to
make
a
thorough
search
of
all
the
little
grated
windows
and
a
door
which
led
out
into
a
sort
of
little
areaway
for
the
removal
of
ashes
and
refuse
the
door
showed
no
evidence
of
having
been
tampered
with
nor
did
any
of
the
windows
at
first
sight
a
low
exclamation
from
kennedy
brought
us
to
his
side
he
had
opened
one
of
the
windows
and
thrust
his
hand
out
against
the
grating
which
had
fallen
on
the
outside
pavement
with
a
clang
the
bars
had
been
completely
and
laboriously
sawed
through
and
the
whole
thing
had
been
wedged
back
into
place
so
that
nothing
would
be
detected
at
a
cursory
glance
he
was
regarding
the
lock
on
the
window
apparently
it
was
all
right
actually
it
had
been
sprung
so
that
it
was
useless
most
persons
he
remarked
do
know
enough
about
jimmies
against
them
an
ordinary
or
is
no
protection
with
a
jimmy
eighteen
inches
long
even
an
anaemic
burglar
can
exert
a
pressure
sufficient
to
lift
two
tons
not
one
window
in
a
thousand
can
stand
that
strain
the
only
use
of
locks
is
to
keep
out
and
compel
the
modern
scientific
educated
burglar
to
make
a
noise
but
making
a
noise
is
enough
here
at
night
this
place
with
all
its
fabulous
treasures
must
be
guarded
constantly
now
every
hour
as
if
the
front
door
were
wide
open
the
bars
replaced
and
the
window
apparently
locked
as
before
craig
devoted
his
efforts
to
examining
the
packing
cases
in
the
basement
as
yet
apparently
nothing
down
there
had
been
disturbed
but
while
rummaging
about
from
an
angle
formed
behind
one
of
the
cases
he
drew
forth
a
cane
to
all
appearances
an
ordinary
malacca
he
balanced
it
in
his
hand
a
moment
then
shook
his
head
too
heavy
for
a
malacca
he
ruminated
then
an
idea
seemed
to
occur
to
him
he
gave
the
handle
a
twist
sure
enough
it
came
off
and
as
it
did
so
a
bright
little
light
flashed
up
well
what
do
you
think
of
that
he
exclaimed
for
a
scientific
that
is
the
neatest
thing
i
have
ever
seen
an
electric
light
cane
with
a
little
incandescent
lamp
and
a
battery
hidden
in
it
this
grows
interesting
we
must
at
last
have
found
the
cache
of
a
real
gentleman
burglar
such
as
bertillon
says
exists
only
in
books
i
wonder
if
he
has
anything
else
hidden
back
here
he
reached
down
and
pulled
out
a
peculiar
little
instrument
a
single
blue
steel
cylinder
he
fitted
a
hard
rubber
cap
snugly
into
the
palm
of
his
hand
and
with
the
first
and
middle
fingers
encircled
the
cylinder
over
a
steel
ring
near
the
other
end
a
loud
report
followed
and
a
vase
just
unpacked
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
basement
was
shattered
as
if
by
an
explosion
phew
exclaimed
kennedy
i
did
mean
to
do
that
i
knew
the
thing
was
loaded
but
i
had
no
idea
the
ring
at
the
end
was
so
delicate
as
to
shoot
it
off
at
a
touch
it
one
of
those
aristocratic
little
apache
pistols
that
one
can
carry
in
his
vest
pocket
and
hide
in
his
hand
say
but
that
stung
and
back
here
is
a
little
box
of
cartridges
too
we
looked
at
each
other
in
amazement
at
the
chance
find
apparently
the
vandal
had
planned
a
series
of
visits
now
let
me
see
resumed
kennedy
i
suppose
our
very
human
but
none
the
less
mysterious
intruder
expected
to
use
these
again
well
let
him
try
i
put
them
back
here
for
the
present
i
want
to
watch
in
the
i
could
not
help
wondering
whether
after
all
it
might
not
be
an
inside
job
and
the
fixing
of
the
window
merely
a
blind
or
was
the
vandal
fascinated
by
the
subtle
influence
of
mysticism
that
so
often
seems
to
emanate
from
objects
that
have
come
down
from
the
remote
ages
of
the
world
i
could
not
help
asking
myself
whether
the
story
that
miss
white
had
told
was
absolutely
true
had
there
been
anything
more
than
superstition
in
the
girl
evident
fright
she
had
seen
something
i
felt
sure
for
it
was
certain
she
was
very
much
disturbed
but
what
was
it
she
had
really
seen
so
far
all
that
kennedy
had
found
had
proved
that
the
reincarnation
of
the
priestess
ka
had
been
very
material
perhaps
the
reincarnation
had
got
in
in
the
daytime
and
had
spent
the
hours
until
night
in
the
it
might
well
have
been
chosen
as
the
safest
and
least
suspicious
kennedy
evidently
had
some
ideas
and
plans
for
no
sooner
had
he
completed
arrangements
with
lith
so
that
we
could
get
into
the
museum
that
night
to
watch
than
he
excused
himself
scarcely
around
the
corner
on
the
next
business
street
he
hurried
into
a
telephone
booth
i
called
up
first
deputy
he
explained
as
he
left
the
booth
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
you
know
it
is
the
duty
of
two
of
men
to
visit
all
the
of
the
city
at
least
once
a
week
looking
over
recent
pledges
and
comparing
them
with
descriptions
of
stolen
articles
i
gave
him
a
list
from
that
catalogue
of
and
i
think
that
if
any
of
the
emeralds
for
instance
have
been
pawned
his
men
will
be
on
the
alert
and
will
find
it
out
we
had
a
leisurely
dinner
at
a
hotel
during
most
of
which
time
kennedy
gazed
vacantly
at
his
food
only
once
did
he
mention
the
case
and
that
was
almost
as
if
he
were
thinking
aloud
nowadays
he
remarked
criminals
are
exceptionally
well
informed
they
used
to
steal
only
money
and
jewels
it
is
famous
pictures
and
antiques
also
they
know
something
about
the
value
of
antique
bronze
and
marble
in
fact
the
spread
of
a
taste
for
art
has
taught
the
enterprising
burglar
that
such
things
are
worth
money
and
he
in
turn
has
educated
up
the
receivers
of
stolen
goods
to
pay
a
reasonable
percentage
of
the
value
of
his
artistic
plunder
the
success
of
the
european
art
thief
is
enlightening
the
american
thief
that
why
i
think
we
find
some
of
this
stuff
in
the
hands
of
the
professional
fences
it
was
still
early
in
the
evening
when
we
returned
to
the
museum
and
let
ourselves
in
with
the
key
that
lith
had
loaned
kennedy
he
had
been
anxious
to
join
us
in
the
watch
but
craig
had
diplomatically
declined
a
circumstance
that
puzzled
me
and
set
me
thinking
that
perhaps
he
suspected
the
curator
himself
we
posted
ourselves
in
an
angle
where
we
could
not
possibly
be
seen
even
if
the
full
force
of
the
electrolier
were
switched
on
hour
after
hour
we
waited
but
nothing
happened
there
were
strange
and
weird
noises
in
plenty
not
calculated
to
reassure
one
but
craig
was
always
ready
with
an
explanation
it
was
in
the
forenoon
of
the
day
after
our
long
and
unfruitful
vigil
in
the
that
lith
himself
appeared
at
our
apartment
in
a
great
state
of
perturbation
miss
white
has
disappeared
he
gasped
in
answer
to
craig
hurried
question
when
i
opened
the
museum
she
was
not
there
as
she
is
usually
instead
i
found
this
note
he
laid
the
following
hastily
written
message
on
the
table
do
not
try
to
follow
me
it
is
the
green
curse
that
has
pursued
me
from
paris
i
can
not
escape
it
but
i
may
prevent
it
from
affecting
others
lucille
white
that
was
all
we
looked
at
each
other
at
a
loss
to
understand
the
enigmatic
wording
the
green
curse
i
rather
expected
something
of
the
sort
observed
kennedy
by
the
way
the
shoenails
were
french
as
i
surmised
they
show
the
marks
of
french
heels
it
was
miss
white
herself
who
hid
in
the
impossible
exclaimed
lith
incredulously
as
for
myself
i
had
learned
that
it
was
of
no
use
being
incredulous
with
kennedy
a
moment
later
the
door
opened
and
one
of
men
came
in
bursting
with
news
some
of
the
emeralds
had
been
discovered
in
a
third
avenue
mindful
of
the
historic
fate
of
the
mexican
madonna
and
the
stolen
statue
of
the
egyptian
goddess
neith
had
instituted
a
thorough
search
with
the
result
that
at
least
part
of
the
pilfered
jewels
had
been
located
there
was
only
one
clue
to
the
thief
but
it
looked
promising
the
pawnbroker
described
him
as
a
crazy
frenchman
of
an
artist
tall
with
a
pointed
black
beard
in
pawning
the
jewels
he
had
given
the
name
of
edouard
delaverde
and
the
city
detectives
were
making
a
canvass
of
the
better
known
studios
in
hope
of
tracing
him
kennedy
lith
and
myself
walked
around
to
the
where
miss
white
lived
there
was
nothing
about
it
from
the
landlady
to
the
gossip
to
distinguish
it
from
scores
of
other
places
of
the
better
sort
we
had
no
trouble
in
finding
out
that
miss
white
had
not
returned
home
at
all
the
night
before
the
landlady
seemed
to
look
on
her
as
a
woman
of
mystery
and
confided
to
us
that
it
was
an
open
secret
that
she
was
not
an
american
at
all
but
a
french
girl
whose
name
she
believed
was
really
lucille
leblanc
which
after
all
was
white
kennedy
made
no
comment
but
i
wavered
between
the
conclusions
that
she
had
been
the
victim
of
foul
play
and
that
she
might
be
the
criminal
herself
or
at
least
a
member
of
a
band
of
criminals
no
trace
of
her
could
be
found
through
the
usual
agencies
for
locating
missing
persons
it
was
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
however
when
word
came
to
us
that
one
of
the
city
detectives
had
apparently
located
the
studio
of
delaverde
it
was
coupled
with
the
interesting
information
that
the
day
before
a
woman
roughly
answering
the
description
of
miss
white
had
been
seen
there
delaverde
himself
was
gone
the
building
to
which
the
detective
took
us
was
in
a
residence
section
which
had
remained
as
a
sort
of
little
eddy
to
one
side
of
the
current
of
business
that
had
swept
everything
before
it
it
was
an
old
building
and
large
and
was
entirely
given
over
to
studios
of
artists
into
one
of
the
cheapest
of
the
suites
we
were
directed
it
was
almost
bare
of
furniture
and
in
a
peculiarly
shiftless
state
of
disorder
a
picture
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
room
and
several
completed
ones
were
leaning
against
the
wall
they
were
of
the
wildest
character
imaginable
even
the
conceptions
of
the
futurists
looked
tame
in
comparison
kennedy
at
once
began
rummaging
and
exploring
in
a
corner
of
a
cupboard
near
the
door
he
disclosed
a
row
of
bottles
one
was
filled
halfway
with
an
liquid
he
held
it
up
to
the
light
and
read
the
label
absinthe
ah
he
exclaimed
with
evident
interest
looking
first
at
the
bottle
and
then
at
the
wild
formless
pictures
our
crazy
frenchman
was
an
absintheur
i
thought
the
pictures
were
rather
the
product
of
a
disordered
mind
than
of
genius
he
replaced
the
bottle
adding
it
is
only
recently
that
our
own
government
placed
a
ban
on
the
importation
of
that
stuff
as
a
result
of
the
decision
of
the
department
of
agriculture
that
it
was
dangerous
to
health
and
conflicted
with
the
pure
food
law
in
france
they
call
it
the
the
the
the
of
poisons
compared
with
other
alcoholic
beverages
it
has
the
greatest
toxicity
of
all
there
are
laws
against
the
stuff
in
france
switzerland
and
belgium
it
is
the
alcohol
alone
although
there
is
from
fifty
to
eighty
per
cent
in
it
that
makes
it
so
deadly
it
is
the
absinthe
the
oil
of
wormwood
whose
bitterness
has
passed
into
a
proverb
the
active
principle
absinthin
is
a
narcotic
poison
the
stuff
creates
a
habit
most
insidious
and
difficult
to
break
a
longing
more
exacting
than
hunger
it
is
almost
as
fatal
as
cocaine
in
its
blasting
effects
on
mind
and
body
wormwood
he
pursued
still
rummaging
about
has
a
special
affinity
for
the
and
the
nervous
system
in
general
it
produces
a
special
affliction
of
the
mind
which
might
be
called
absinthism
loss
of
will
follows
its
use
brutishness
softening
of
the
brain
it
gives
rise
to
the
wildest
hallucinations
perhaps
that
was
why
our
absintheur
chose
first
to
destroy
or
steal
all
things
green
as
if
there
were
some
merit
in
the
colour
when
he
might
have
made
away
with
so
many
more
valuable
things
absintheurs
have
been
known
to
perform
some
of
the
most
intricate
manoeuvres
requiring
great
skill
and
the
use
of
delicate
tools
they
are
given
to
disappearing
and
have
no
memory
of
their
actions
afterward
on
an
desk
lay
some
books
including
degenerate
man
and
criminal
woman
kennedy
glanced
at
them
then
at
a
crumpled
manuscript
that
was
stuck
into
a
pigeonhole
it
was
written
in
a
trembling
cramped
foreign
hand
evidently
part
of
a
book
or
an
article
oh
the
wickedness
of
wealth
it
began
while
millions
of
the
poor
toilers
slave
and
starve
and
shiver
the
of
like
the
of
ancient
egypt
spend
the
money
wrung
from
the
blood
of
the
people
in
useless
and
worthless
toys
of
art
while
the
people
have
no
bread
in
old
books
while
the
people
have
no
homes
in
jewels
while
the
people
have
no
clothes
thousands
are
spent
on
dead
artists
but
a
dollar
is
grudged
to
a
living
genius
down
with
such
art
i
dedicate
my
life
to
righting
the
wrongs
of
the
proletariat
vive
the
thing
was
becoming
more
serious
but
by
far
the
most
serious
discovery
in
the
now
deserted
studio
was
a
number
of
large
glass
tubes
in
a
corner
some
broken
others
not
yet
used
and
standing
in
rows
as
if
waiting
to
be
filled
a
bottle
labelled
sulphuric
acid
stood
at
one
end
of
a
shelf
while
at
the
other
was
a
huge
jar
full
of
black
grains
next
a
bottle
of
chlorate
of
potash
kennedy
took
a
few
of
the
black
grains
and
placed
them
on
a
metal
he
lighted
a
match
there
was
a
puff
and
a
little
cloud
of
smoke
ah
he
exclaimed
black
gunpowder
our
absintheur
was
a
an
expert
perhaps
let
me
see
i
imagine
he
was
making
an
explosive
bomb
ingeniously
contrived
of
five
glass
tubes
the
centre
one
i
venture
contained
sulphuric
acid
and
chlorate
of
potash
separated
by
a
wad
of
cotton
wool
then
the
two
tubes
on
each
side
probably
contained
the
powder
and
perhaps
the
outside
tubes
were
filled
with
spirits
of
turpentine
when
it
is
placed
in
position
it
is
so
arranged
that
the
acid
in
the
center
tube
is
uppermost
and
will
thus
gradually
soak
through
the
cotton
wool
and
cause
great
heat
and
an
explosion
by
contact
with
the
potash
that
would
ignite
the
powder
in
the
next
tubes
and
that
would
scatter
the
blazing
turpentine
causing
a
terrific
explosion
and
a
widespread
fire
with
an
imperative
idea
of
vengeance
such
as
that
manuscript
discloses
either
for
his
own
wrongs
as
an
artist
or
for
the
fancied
wrongs
of
the
people
what
may
this
absintheur
not
be
planning
now
he
has
disappeared
but
perhaps
he
may
be
more
dangerous
if
found
than
if
lost
viii
the
mummy
case
the
horrible
thought
occurred
to
me
that
perhaps
he
was
not
alone
i
had
seen
spencer
infatuation
with
his
attractive
librarian
the
janitor
of
the
was
positive
that
a
woman
answering
her
description
had
been
a
visitor
at
the
studio
would
she
be
used
to
get
at
the
millionaire
and
his
treasures
was
she
herself
part
of
the
plot
to
victimise
perhaps
kill
him
the
woman
had
been
much
of
an
enigma
to
me
at
first
she
was
more
so
now
it
was
barely
possible
that
she
too
was
an
absintheur
who
had
shaken
off
the
curse
for
a
time
only
to
relapse
into
it
again
if
there
were
any
thoughts
like
these
passing
through
kennedy
mind
he
did
not
show
it
at
least
not
in
the
shape
of
hesitating
in
the
course
he
had
evidently
mapped
out
to
follow
he
said
little
but
hurried
off
from
the
studio
in
a
cab
again
to
the
laboratory
a
few
minutes
later
we
were
speeding
down
to
the
museum
there
was
not
much
time
for
craig
to
work
if
he
hoped
to
be
ready
for
anything
that
might
happen
that
night
he
began
by
winding
coil
after
coil
of
copper
wire
about
the
storeroom
in
the
basement
of
the
museum
it
was
not
a
very
difficult
matter
to
conceal
it
so
crowded
was
the
room
or
to
lead
the
ends
out
through
a
window
at
the
opposite
side
from
that
where
the
window
had
been
broken
open
in
the
he
next
installed
several
boxes
such
as
those
which
i
had
seen
him
experimenting
with
during
his
tests
of
selenium
on
the
afternoon
when
spencer
had
first
called
on
us
they
were
boxes
about
ten
inches
long
three
inches
or
so
wide
and
four
inches
deep
one
end
was
open
or
at
least
looked
as
though
the
end
had
been
shoved
several
inches
into
the
interior
of
the
box
i
looked
into
one
of
the
boxes
and
saw
a
slit
in
the
wall
that
had
been
shoved
in
kennedy
was
busy
adjusting
the
apparatus
and
paused
only
to
remark
that
the
boxes
contained
two
sensitive
selenium
surfaces
balanced
against
two
carbon
resistances
there
was
also
in
the
box
a
clockwork
mechanism
which
craig
wound
up
and
set
ticking
ever
so
softly
then
he
moved
a
rod
that
seemed
to
cover
the
slit
until
the
apparatus
was
adjusted
to
his
satisfaction
a
delicate
operation
judging
by
the
care
he
took
several
of
these
boxes
were
installed
and
by
that
time
it
was
quite
late
wires
from
the
apparatus
in
the
also
led
outside
and
these
as
well
as
the
wires
from
the
coils
down
in
the
basement
he
led
across
the
bit
of
garden
back
of
the
spencer
house
and
up
to
a
room
on
the
top
floor
in
the
upper
room
he
attached
the
wires
from
the
storeroom
to
what
looked
like
a
piece
of
crystal
and
a
telephone
receiver
those
from
the
terminated
in
something
very
much
like
the
apparatus
which
a
wireless
operator
wears
over
his
head
among
other
things
which
craig
had
brought
down
from
the
laboratory
was
a
package
which
he
had
not
yet
unwrapped
he
placed
it
near
the
window
still
wrapped
it
was
quite
large
and
must
have
weighed
fifteen
or
twenty
pounds
that
done
he
produced
a
and
began
as
if
he
were
a
surveyor
to
measure
various
distances
and
apparently
to
calculate
the
angles
and
distances
from
the
of
the
spencer
house
to
the
skylight
which
was
the
exact
centre
of
the
museum
the
straight
distance
if
i
recall
correctly
was
in
the
neighborhood
of
four
hundred
feet
these
preparations
completed
there
was
nothing
left
to
do
but
to
wait
for
something
to
happen
spencer
had
declined
to
get
alarmed
about
our
fears
for
his
own
safety
and
only
with
difficulty
had
we
been
able
to
dissuade
him
from
moving
heaven
and
earth
to
find
miss
white
a
proceeding
which
must
certainly
have
disarranged
kennedy
carefully
laid
plans
so
interested
was
he
that
he
postponed
one
of
the
most
important
business
conferences
of
the
year
growing
out
of
the
suits
in
order
to
be
present
with
lith
and
ourselves
in
the
little
upper
back
room
it
was
quite
late
when
kennedy
completed
his
hasty
arrangements
yet
as
the
night
advanced
we
grew
more
and
more
impatient
for
something
to
happen
craig
was
apparently
even
more
anxious
than
he
had
been
the
night
before
when
we
watched
in
the
itself
spencer
was
nervously
smoking
lighting
one
cigar
furiously
from
another
until
the
air
was
almost
blue
scarcely
a
word
was
spoken
as
hour
after
hour
craig
sat
with
the
receiver
to
his
ear
connected
with
the
coils
down
in
the
storeroom
you
might
call
this
an
electric
detective
he
had
explained
to
spencer
for
example
if
you
suspected
that
anything
out
of
the
way
was
going
on
in
a
room
anywhere
this
would
report
much
to
you
even
if
you
were
miles
away
it
is
the
discovery
of
a
student
of
thorne
baker
the
english
electrical
expert
he
was
experimenting
with
electric
currents
investigating
the
nature
of
the
discharges
used
for
electrifying
certain
things
quite
by
accident
he
found
that
when
the
room
on
which
he
was
experimenting
was
occupied
by
some
person
his
indicated
that
fact
he
tested
the
degree
of
variation
by
passing
the
current
first
through
the
room
and
then
through
a
sensitive
crystal
to
a
delicate
telephone
receiver
there
was
a
distinct
change
in
the
buzzing
sound
heard
through
the
telephone
when
the
room
was
occupied
or
unoccupied
what
i
have
done
is
to
wind
single
loops
of
plain
wire
on
each
side
of
that
room
down
there
as
well
as
to
wind
around
the
room
a
few
turns
of
concealed
copper
wire
these
collectors
are
fitted
to
a
crystal
of
carborundum
and
a
telephone
receiver
we
had
each
tried
the
thing
and
could
hear
a
distinct
buzzing
in
the
receiver
the
presence
of
a
man
or
woman
in
that
room
would
be
evident
to
a
person
listening
miles
away
he
went
on
a
current
is
constantly
passing
through
that
storeroom
that
is
what
causes
that
normal
buzzing
it
was
verging
on
midnight
when
kennedy
suddenly
cried
here
walter
take
this
receiver
you
remember
how
the
buzzing
sounded
listen
tell
me
if
you
too
can
detect
the
change
i
clapped
the
receiver
quickly
to
my
ear
indeed
i
could
tell
the
difference
in
place
of
the
load
buzzing
there
was
only
a
mild
sound
it
was
slower
and
lower
that
means
he
said
excitedly
that
some
one
has
entered
that
storeroom
by
the
broken
window
let
me
take
the
receiver
back
again
ah
the
buzzing
is
coming
back
he
is
leaving
the
room
i
suppose
he
has
found
the
electric
light
cane
and
the
pistol
where
he
left
them
now
walter
since
you
have
become
accustomed
to
this
thing
take
it
and
tell
me
what
you
hear
craig
had
already
seized
the
other
apparatus
connected
with
the
and
had
the
wireless
receiver
over
his
head
he
was
listening
with
rapt
attention
talking
while
he
waited
this
is
an
apparatus
he
was
saying
that
was
devised
by
fournier
lecturer
on
physics
at
birmingham
university
to
aid
the
blind
it
is
known
as
the
optophone
what
i
am
literally
doing
now
is
to
hear
light
the
optophone
translates
light
into
sound
by
means
of
that
wonderful
little
element
selenium
which
in
darkness
is
a
poor
conductor
of
electricity
but
in
light
is
a
good
conductor
this
property
is
used
in
the
optophone
in
transmitting
an
electric
current
which
is
interrupted
by
a
special
clockwork
interrupter
it
makes
light
and
darkness
audible
in
the
telephone
this
thing
over
my
head
is
like
a
wireless
telephone
receiver
capable
of
detecting
a
current
of
even
a
quarter
of
a
microampere
we
were
all
waiting
expectantly
for
craig
to
speak
evidently
the
intruder
was
now
mounting
the
stairs
to
the
actually
i
can
hear
the
light
of
the
stars
shining
in
through
that
wonderful
plate
glass
skylight
of
yours
spencer
he
went
on
a
few
moments
ago
when
the
moon
shone
through
i
could
hear
it
like
the
rumble
of
a
passing
cart
i
knew
it
was
the
moon
both
because
i
could
see
that
it
must
be
shining
in
and
because
i
recognised
the
sound
the
sun
would
thunder
like
a
passing
if
it
were
daytime
now
i
can
distinguish
a
shadow
passing
between
the
optophone
and
the
light
a
hand
moved
across
in
front
of
it
would
give
a
purring
sound
and
a
glimpse
out
of
a
window
in
daylight
would
sound
like
a
cinematograph
reeling
off
a
film
ah
there
he
is
craig
was
listening
with
intense
excitement
now
our
intruder
has
entered
the
he
is
flashing
his
electric
light
cane
about
at
various
objects
reconnoitring
no
doubt
if
i
were
expert
enough
and
had
had
time
to
study
it
i
could
tell
you
by
the
sound
just
what
he
is
looking
at
craig
i
interrupted
this
time
very
excited
myself
the
buzzing
from
the
current
is
getting
lower
and
lower
by
george
then
there
is
another
of
them
he
replied
i
not
surprised
keep
a
sharp
watch
tell
me
the
moment
the
buzzing
increases
again
spencer
could
scarcely
control
his
impatience
it
had
been
a
long
time
since
he
had
been
a
mere
spectator
and
he
did
not
seem
to
relish
being
held
in
check
by
anybody
now
that
you
are
sure
the
vandal
is
there
he
cut
in
his
cigar
out
in
his
excitement
ca
we
make
a
dash
over
there
and
get
him
before
he
has
a
chance
to
do
any
more
damage
he
might
be
destroying
thousands
of
dollars
worth
of
stuff
while
we
are
waiting
here
and
he
could
destroy
the
whole
collection
building
and
all
including
ourselves
into
the
bargain
if
he
heard
so
much
as
a
whisper
from
us
added
kennedy
firmly
that
second
person
has
left
the
storeroom
craig
i
put
in
the
buzzing
has
returned
again
full
force
kennedy
tore
the
wireless
receiver
from
his
ear
here
walter
never
mind
about
that
electric
detective
any
more
then
take
the
optophone
describe
minutely
to
me
just
exactly
what
you
hear
he
had
taken
from
his
pocket
a
small
metal
ball
i
seized
the
receiver
from
him
and
fitted
it
to
my
ear
it
took
me
several
instants
to
accustom
my
ears
to
the
new
sounds
but
they
were
plain
enough
and
i
shouted
my
impressions
of
their
variations
kennedy
was
busy
at
the
window
over
the
heavy
package
from
which
he
had
torn
the
wrapping
his
back
was
toward
us
and
we
could
not
see
what
he
was
doing
a
terrific
din
sounded
in
my
ears
almost
splitting
my
it
was
as
though
i
had
been
suddenly
hurled
into
a
magnified
cave
of
the
winds
and
a
cataract
mightier
than
niagara
was
thundering
at
me
it
was
so
painful
that
i
cried
out
in
surprise
and
involuntarily
dropped
the
receiver
to
the
floor
it
was
the
switching
on
of
the
full
glare
of
the
electric
lights
in
the
craig
shouted
the
other
person
must
have
got
up
to
the
room
quicker
than
i
expected
here
goes
a
loud
explosion
took
place
apparently
on
the
very
of
our
room
almost
at
the
same
instant
there
was
a
crash
of
glass
from
the
museum
we
sprang
to
the
window
i
expecting
to
see
kennedy
injured
spencer
expecting
to
see
his
costly
museum
a
mass
of
smoking
ruins
instead
we
saw
nothing
of
the
sort
on
the
was
a
peculiar
little
instrument
that
looked
like
a
miniature
with
an
elaborate
system
of
springs
and
levers
to
break
the
recoil
craig
had
turned
from
it
so
suddenly
that
he
actually
ran
full
tilt
into
us
come
on
he
cried
breathlessly
bolting
from
the
room
and
seizing
lith
by
the
arm
as
he
did
so
lith
the
keys
to
the
museum
quick
we
must
get
there
before
the
fumes
clear
away
he
was
taking
the
stairs
two
at
a
time
dragging
the
dignified
curator
with
him
in
fewer
seconds
than
i
can
tell
it
we
were
in
the
museum
and
mounting
the
broad
staircase
to
the
an
overpowering
gas
seemed
to
permeate
everything
stand
back
a
moment
cautioned
kennedy
as
we
neared
the
door
i
have
just
shot
in
here
one
of
those
asphyxiating
bombs
which
the
paris
police
invented
to
war
against
the
apaches
and
the
bandits
open
all
the
windows
back
here
and
let
the
air
clear
walter
breathe
as
little
of
it
as
you
can
but
come
here
do
you
see
over
there
near
the
other
door
a
figure
lying
on
the
floor
make
a
dash
in
after
me
and
carry
it
out
there
is
just
one
thing
more
if
i
am
not
back
in
a
minute
come
in
and
try
to
get
me
he
had
already
preceded
me
into
the
stifling
fumes
with
a
last
long
breath
of
fresh
air
i
plunged
in
after
him
scarcely
knowing
what
would
happen
to
me
i
saw
the
figure
on
the
floor
seized
it
and
backed
out
of
the
room
as
fast
as
i
could
dizzy
and
giddy
from
the
fumes
i
had
been
forced
to
inhale
i
managed
to
drag
the
form
to
the
nearest
window
it
was
lucille
white
an
instant
later
i
felt
myself
unceremoniously
pushed
aside
spencer
had
forgotten
all
about
the
millions
of
dollars
worth
of
curios
all
about
the
suspicions
that
had
been
entertained
against
her
and
had
taken
the
burden
from
me
this
is
the
second
time
i
have
found
you
here
edouard
she
was
muttering
in
her
still
struggling
the
first
time
that
night
i
hid
in
the
you
fled
when
i
called
for
help
i
have
followed
you
every
moment
since
last
night
to
prevent
this
edouard
do
do
remember
i
was
i
am
your
wife
listen
to
me
oh
it
is
the
absinthe
that
has
spoiled
your
art
and
made
it
worthless
not
the
critics
it
is
not
spencer
who
has
enticed
me
away
but
you
who
drove
me
away
first
from
paris
and
now
from
new
york
he
has
been
only
no
no
she
was
shrieking
now
her
eyes
wide
open
as
she
realised
it
was
spencer
himself
she
saw
leaning
over
her
with
a
great
effort
she
seemed
to
rouse
herself
do
stay
run
run
leave
me
he
has
a
bomb
that
may
go
off
at
any
moment
oh
oh
it
is
the
curse
of
absinthe
that
pursues
me
will
you
not
go
vite
vite
she
had
almost
fainted
and
was
lapsing
into
french
laughing
and
crying
alternately
telling
him
to
go
yet
clinging
to
him
spencer
paid
no
attention
to
what
she
had
said
of
the
bomb
but
i
did
the
minute
was
up
and
kennedy
was
in
there
yet
i
turned
to
rush
in
again
to
warn
him
at
any
peril
just
then
a
form
staggered
against
me
it
was
craig
himself
he
was
holding
the
infernal
machine
of
the
five
glass
tubes
that
might
at
any
instant
blow
us
into
eternity
overcome
himself
he
stumbled
the
sinking
sensation
in
my
heart
i
can
never
describe
it
was
just
a
second
that
i
waited
for
the
terrific
explosion
that
was
to
end
it
all
for
us
one
long
interminable
second
but
it
did
not
come
limp
as
i
was
with
the
shock
i
dropped
down
beside
him
and
bent
over
a
glass
of
water
walter
he
murmured
and
fan
me
a
bit
i
dare
trust
myself
to
carry
the
thing
complete
so
i
emptied
the
acid
into
the
sarcophagus
i
guess
i
must
have
stayed
in
there
too
long
but
we
are
safe
see
if
you
can
drag
out
delaverde
he
is
in
there
by
the
spencer
was
still
holding
lucille
although
she
was
much
better
in
the
fresh
air
of
the
hall
i
understand
he
was
muttering
you
have
been
following
this
fiend
of
a
husband
of
yours
to
protect
the
museum
and
myself
from
him
lucille
lucille
look
at
me
you
are
mine
not
his
whether
he
is
dead
or
alive
i
will
free
you
from
him
from
the
curse
of
the
absinthe
that
has
pursued
you
the
fumes
had
cleared
a
great
deal
by
this
time
in
the
centre
of
the
we
found
a
man
a
tall
frenchman
crazy
indeed
from
the
curse
of
the
green
absinthe
that
had
ruined
him
he
was
scarcely
breathing
from
a
deadly
wound
in
his
chest
the
ring
of
the
apache
pistol
had
exploded
the
cartridge
as
he
fell
spencer
did
not
even
look
at
him
as
he
carried
his
own
burden
down
to
the
little
office
of
lith
when
a
rich
man
marries
a
girl
who
has
been
earning
her
own
living
the
newspapers
always
distort
it
he
whispered
aside
to
me
a
few
minutes
later
jameson
you
a
newspaperman
i
depend
on
you
to
get
the
facts
straight
this
time
outside
kennedy
grasped
my
arm
you
do
that
walter
he
asked
persuasively
spencer
is
a
client
that
one
does
get
every
day
just
drop
into
the
star
office
and
give
them
the
straight
story
i
promise
you
i
not
take
another
case
until
you
are
free
again
to
go
on
with
me
in
it
there
was
no
denying
him
as
briefly
as
i
could
i
rehearsed
the
main
facts
to
the
managing
editor
late
that
night
i
was
too
tired
to
write
it
at
length
yet
i
could
not
help
a
feeling
of
satisfaction
as
he
exclaimed
great
stuff
jameson
great
i
know
i
replied
but
this
existence
for
a
week
wears
you
out
my
dear
boy
he
persisted
if
i
had
turned
some
one
else
loose
on
that
story
he
have
been
dead
go
to
it
it
fine
it
was
a
bit
of
blarney
i
knew
but
somehow
or
other
i
liked
it
it
was
just
what
i
needed
to
encourage
me
and
i
hurried
uptown
promising
myself
a
sound
sleep
at
any
rate
very
good
remarked
kennedy
the
next
morning
poking
his
head
in
at
my
door
and
holding
up
a
copy
of
the
star
into
which
a
very
accurate
brief
account
of
the
affair
had
been
dropped
at
the
last
moment
going
over
to
the
laboratory
see
you
there
as
soon
as
you
can
get
over
craig
i
remarked
an
hour
or
so
later
as
i
sauntered
in
on
him
hard
at
work
i
do
see
how
you
stand
this
feverish
activity
stand
it
he
repeated
holding
up
a
beaker
to
the
light
to
watch
a
reaction
it
my
very
life
stand
it
why
man
if
you
want
me
to
pass
away
stop
it
as
long
as
it
lasts
i
shall
be
all
right
let
it
quit
and
i
i
go
back
to
research
work
he
laughed
evidently
he
had
been
waiting
for
me
for
as
he
talked
he
laid
aside
the
materials
with
which
he
had
been
working
and
was
preparing
to
go
out
then
too
he
went
on
i
like
to
be
with
people
like
spencer
and
brixton
for
example
while
i
was
waiting
here
for
you
there
came
a
call
from
emery
pitts
emery
pitts
i
echoed
what
does
he
want
the
best
way
to
find
out
is
to
find
out
he
answered
simply
getting
late
and
i
promised
to
be
there
directly
i
think
we
better
take
a
taxi
a
few
minutes
later
we
were
ushered
into
a
large
fifth
avenue
mansion
and
were
listening
to
a
story
which
interested
even
kennedy
not
even
a
blood
spot
has
been
disturbed
in
the
kitchen
nothing
has
been
altered
since
the
discovery
of
the
murdered
chef
except
that
his
body
has
been
moved
into
the
next
room
emery
pitts
one
of
the
thousand
millionaires
of
steel
overwrought
as
he
was
by
a
murder
in
his
own
household
sank
back
in
his
exhausted
pitts
was
not
an
old
man
indeed
in
years
he
was
in
the
prime
of
life
yet
by
his
looks
he
might
almost
have
been
double
his
age
the
more
so
in
contrast
with
minna
pitts
his
young
and
very
pretty
wife
who
stood
near
him
in
the
quaint
and
solicitously
moved
a
pillow
back
of
his
head
kennedy
and
i
looked
on
in
amazement
we
knew
that
he
had
recently
retired
from
active
business
giving
as
a
reason
his
failing
health
but
neither
of
us
had
thought
when
the
hasty
summons
came
early
that
morning
to
visit
him
immediately
at
his
house
that
his
condition
was
as
serious
as
it
now
appeared
in
the
kitchen
repeated
kennedy
evidently
not
prepared
for
any
trouble
in
that
part
of
the
house
pitts
who
had
closed
his
eyes
now
reopened
them
slowly
and
i
noticed
how
contracted
were
the
pupils
yes
he
answered
somewhat
wearily
my
private
kitchen
which
i
have
had
fitted
up
you
know
i
am
on
a
diet
have
been
ever
since
i
offered
the
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
for
the
sure
restoration
of
youth
i
shall
have
you
taken
out
there
presently
he
lapsed
again
into
a
half
dreamy
state
his
head
bowed
on
one
hand
resting
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
the
morning
mail
still
lay
on
the
table
some
letters
open
as
they
had
been
when
the
discovery
had
been
announced
pitts
was
apparently
much
excited
and
unnerved
by
the
gruesome
discovery
in
the
house
you
have
no
idea
who
the
murderer
might
be
asked
kennedy
addressing
pitts
but
glancing
keenly
at
his
wife
no
replied
pitts
if
i
had
i
should
have
called
the
regular
police
i
wanted
you
to
take
it
up
before
they
spoiled
any
of
the
clues
in
the
first
place
we
do
not
think
it
could
have
been
done
by
any
of
the
other
servants
at
least
minna
says
that
there
was
no
quarrel
how
could
any
one
have
got
in
from
the
outside
asked
craig
there
is
a
back
way
a
servants
entrance
but
it
is
usually
locked
of
course
some
one
might
have
obtained
a
key
to
it
pitts
had
remained
silent
throughout
the
dialogue
i
could
not
help
thinking
that
she
suspected
something
perhaps
was
concealing
something
yet
each
of
them
seemed
equally
anxious
to
have
the
marauder
apprehended
whoever
he
might
be
my
dear
he
said
to
her
at
length
will
you
call
some
one
and
have
them
taken
to
the
kitchen
ix
the
elixir
of
life
as
minna
pitts
led
us
through
the
large
mansion
preparatory
to
turning
us
over
to
a
servant
she
explained
hastily
that
pitts
had
long
been
ill
and
was
now
taking
a
new
treatment
under
thompson
lord
no
one
having
answered
her
bell
in
the
present
state
of
excitement
of
the
house
she
stopped
short
at
the
pivoted
door
of
the
kitchen
with
a
little
shudder
at
the
tragedy
and
stood
only
long
enough
to
relate
to
us
the
story
as
she
had
heard
it
from
the
valet
edward
pitts
it
seemed
had
wanted
an
early
breakfast
and
had
sent
edward
to
order
it
the
valet
had
found
the
kitchen
a
veritable
with
the
negro
chef
sam
lying
dead
on
the
floor
sam
had
been
dead
apparently
since
the
night
before
as
she
hurried
away
kennedy
pushed
open
the
door
it
was
a
marvellous
place
that
antiseptic
or
rather
aseptic
kitchen
with
its
white
tiling
and
enamel
its
huge
and
for
every
purpose
all
of
the
most
expensive
and
modern
make
there
were
marks
everywhere
of
a
struggle
and
by
the
side
of
the
chef
whose
body
now
lay
in
the
next
room
awaiting
the
coroner
lay
a
long
with
which
he
had
evidently
defended
himself
on
its
blade
and
haft
were
huge
coagulated
spots
of
blood
the
body
of
sam
bore
marks
of
his
having
been
clutched
violently
by
the
throat
and
in
his
head
was
a
single
deep
wound
that
penetrated
the
skull
in
a
most
peculiar
manner
it
did
not
seem
possible
that
a
blow
from
a
knife
could
have
done
it
it
was
a
most
unusual
wound
and
not
at
all
the
sort
that
could
have
been
made
by
a
bullet
as
kennedy
examined
it
he
remarked
shaking
his
head
in
confirmation
of
his
own
opinion
that
must
have
been
done
by
a
behr
bulletless
gun
a
bulletless
gun
i
repeated
yes
a
sort
of
pistol
with
a
device
that
projects
a
sharp
blade
with
great
force
no
bullet
and
no
powder
are
used
in
it
but
when
it
is
placed
directly
over
a
vital
point
of
the
skull
so
that
the
aim
is
unerring
a
trigger
lets
a
long
knife
shoot
out
with
tremendous
force
and
death
is
instantaneous
near
the
door
leading
to
the
courtyard
that
opened
on
the
side
street
were
some
spots
of
blood
they
were
so
far
from
the
place
where
the
valet
had
discovered
the
body
of
the
chef
that
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
they
were
blood
from
the
murderer
himself
kennedy
reasoning
in
the
matter
seemed
irresistible
he
looked
under
the
table
near
the
door
covered
with
a
large
light
cloth
beneath
the
table
and
behind
the
cloth
he
found
another
blood
spot
how
did
that
land
there
he
mused
aloud
the
is
bloodless
craig
appeared
to
think
a
moment
then
he
unlocked
and
opened
the
door
a
current
of
air
was
created
and
blew
the
cloth
aside
clearly
he
exclaimed
that
drop
of
blood
was
wafted
under
the
table
as
the
door
was
opened
the
chances
are
all
that
it
came
from
a
cut
on
perhaps
the
hand
or
face
of
the
murderer
himself
it
seemed
to
be
entirely
reasonable
for
the
bloodstains
about
the
room
were
such
as
to
indicate
that
he
had
been
badly
cut
by
the
whoever
attacked
the
chef
must
have
been
deeply
wounded
i
remarked
picking
up
the
bloody
knife
and
looking
about
at
the
stains
comparatively
few
of
which
could
have
come
from
the
one
deep
fatal
wound
in
the
head
of
the
victim
kennedy
was
still
engrossed
in
a
study
of
the
stains
evidently
considering
that
their
size
shape
and
location
might
throw
some
light
on
what
had
occurred
walter
he
said
finally
while
i
busy
here
i
wish
you
would
find
that
valet
edward
i
want
to
talk
to
him
i
found
him
at
last
a
young
fellow
of
much
above
average
intelligence
there
are
some
things
i
have
not
yet
got
clearly
edward
began
kennedy
now
where
was
the
body
exactly
when
you
opened
the
door
edward
pointed
out
the
exact
spot
near
the
side
of
the
kitchen
toward
the
door
leading
out
to
the
breakfast
room
and
opposite
the
and
the
door
to
the
side
street
asked
kennedy
to
all
appearances
very
favorably
impressed
by
the
young
man
it
was
locked
sir
he
answered
positively
kennedy
was
quite
apparently
considering
the
honesty
and
faithfulness
of
the
servant
at
last
he
leaned
over
and
asked
quickly
can
i
trust
you
the
frank
yes
of
the
young
fellow
was
convincing
enough
what
i
want
pursued
kennedy
is
to
have
some
one
inside
this
house
who
can
tell
me
as
much
as
he
can
see
of
the
visitors
the
messengers
that
come
here
this
morning
it
will
be
an
act
of
loyalty
to
your
employer
so
that
you
need
have
no
fear
about
that
edward
bowed
and
left
us
while
i
had
been
seeking
him
kennedy
had
telephoned
hastily
to
his
laboratory
and
had
found
one
of
his
students
there
he
had
ordered
him
to
bring
down
an
apparatus
which
he
described
and
some
other
material
while
we
waited
kennedy
sent
word
to
pitts
that
he
wanted
to
see
him
alone
for
a
few
minutes
the
instrument
appeared
to
be
a
rubber
bulb
and
cuff
with
a
rubber
bag
attached
to
the
inside
from
it
ran
a
tube
which
ended
in
another
graduated
glass
tube
with
a
thin
line
of
mercury
in
it
like
a
thermometer
craig
adjusted
the
thing
over
the
brachial
artery
of
pitts
just
above
the
elbow
it
may
be
a
little
uncomfortable
pitts
he
apologised
but
it
will
be
for
only
a
few
minutes
pressure
through
the
rubber
bulb
shut
off
the
artery
so
that
kennedy
could
no
longer
feel
the
pulse
at
the
wrist
as
he
worked
i
began
to
see
what
he
was
after
the
reading
on
the
graded
scale
of
the
height
of
the
column
of
mercury
indicated
i
knew
blood
pressure
this
time
as
he
worked
i
noted
also
the
flabby
skin
of
pitts
as
well
as
the
small
and
sluggish
pupils
of
his
eyes
he
completed
his
test
in
silence
and
excused
himself
although
as
we
went
back
to
the
kitchen
i
was
burning
with
curiosity
what
was
it
i
asked
what
did
you
discover
that
he
replied
was
a
sphygmomanometer
something
like
the
sphygmograph
which
we
used
once
in
another
case
normal
blood
pressure
is
millimetres
pitts
shows
a
high
pressure
very
high
the
large
life
insurance
companies
are
now
using
this
instrument
they
would
tell
you
that
a
high
pressure
like
that
indicates
apoplexy
pitts
young
as
he
really
is
is
actually
old
for
you
know
the
saying
is
that
a
man
is
as
old
as
his
arteries
pitts
has
hardening
of
the
arteries
arteriosclerosis
perhaps
other
heart
and
kidney
troubles
in
short
craig
paused
then
added
sententiously
as
if
to
himself
you
have
heard
the
latest
theories
about
old
age
that
it
is
due
to
microbic
poisons
secreted
in
the
intestines
and
penetrating
the
intestinal
walls
well
in
premature
senility
the
symptoms
are
the
same
as
in
senility
only
mental
acuteness
is
not
so
impaired
we
had
now
reached
the
kitchen
again
the
student
had
also
brought
down
to
kennedy
a
number
of
sterilised
microscope
slides
and
and
from
here
and
there
in
the
masses
of
blood
spots
kennedy
was
taking
and
preserving
samples
he
also
took
samples
of
the
various
foods
which
he
preserved
in
the
sterilised
tubes
while
he
was
at
work
edward
joined
us
cautiously
has
anything
happened
asked
craig
a
message
came
by
a
boy
for
pitts
whispered
the
valet
what
did
she
do
with
it
tore
it
up
and
the
pieces
she
must
have
hidden
them
somewhere
see
if
you
can
get
them
edward
nodded
and
left
us
yes
i
remarked
after
he
had
gone
it
does
seem
as
if
the
thing
to
do
was
to
get
on
the
trail
of
a
person
bearing
wounds
of
some
kind
i
notice
for
one
thing
craig
that
edward
shows
no
such
marks
nor
does
any
one
else
in
the
house
as
far
as
i
can
see
if
it
were
an
job
i
fancy
edward
at
least
could
clear
himself
the
point
is
to
find
the
person
with
a
bandaged
hand
or
plastered
face
kennedy
assented
but
his
mind
was
on
another
subject
before
we
go
we
must
see
pitts
alone
if
we
can
he
said
simply
in
answer
to
his
inquiry
through
one
of
the
servants
she
sent
down
word
that
she
would
see
us
immediately
in
her
the
events
of
the
morning
had
quite
naturally
upset
her
and
she
was
if
anything
even
paler
than
when
we
saw
her
before
pitts
began
kennedy
i
suppose
you
are
aware
of
the
physical
condition
of
your
husband
it
seemed
a
little
abrupt
to
me
at
first
but
he
intended
it
to
be
why
she
asked
with
real
alarm
is
he
so
very
badly
pretty
badly
remarked
kennedy
mercilessly
observing
the
effect
of
his
words
so
badly
i
fear
that
it
would
not
require
much
more
excitement
like
to
bring
on
an
attack
of
apoplexy
i
should
advise
you
to
take
especial
care
of
him
mrs
pitts
following
his
eyes
i
tried
to
determine
whether
the
agitation
of
the
woman
before
us
was
genuine
or
not
it
certainly
looked
so
but
then
i
knew
that
she
had
been
an
actress
before
her
marriage
was
she
acting
a
part
now
what
do
you
mean
she
asked
tremulously
pitts
replied
kennedy
quickly
observing
still
the
play
of
emotion
on
her
delicate
features
some
one
i
believe
either
regularly
in
or
employed
in
this
house
or
who
had
a
ready
means
of
access
to
it
must
have
entered
that
kitchen
last
night
for
what
purpose
i
can
leave
you
to
judge
but
sam
surprised
the
intruder
there
and
was
killed
for
his
faithfulness
her
startled
look
told
plainly
that
though
she
might
have
suspected
something
of
the
sort
she
did
not
think
that
any
one
else
suspected
much
less
actually
perhaps
knew
it
i
ca
imagine
who
it
could
be
unless
it
might
be
one
of
the
servants
she
murmured
hastily
adding
and
there
is
none
of
them
that
i
have
any
right
to
suspect
she
had
in
a
measure
regained
her
composure
and
kennedy
felt
that
it
was
no
use
to
pursue
the
conversation
further
perhaps
expose
his
hand
before
he
was
ready
to
play
it
that
woman
is
concealing
something
remarked
kennedy
to
me
as
we
left
the
house
a
few
minutes
later
she
at
least
bears
no
marks
of
violence
herself
of
any
kind
i
commented
no
agreed
craig
no
you
are
right
so
far
he
added
i
shall
be
very
busy
in
the
laboratory
this
afternoon
and
probably
longer
however
drop
in
at
dinner
time
and
in
the
meantime
do
say
a
word
to
any
one
but
just
use
your
position
on
the
star
to
keep
in
touch
with
anything
the
police
authorities
may
be
doing
it
was
not
a
difficult
commission
since
they
did
nothing
but
issue
a
statement
the
net
import
of
which
was
to
let
the
public
know
that
they
were
very
active
although
they
had
nothing
to
report
kennedy
was
still
busy
when
i
rejoined
him
a
little
late
purposely
since
i
knew
that
he
would
be
over
his
head
in
work
what
this
a
zoo
i
asked
looking
about
me
as
i
entered
the
sanctum
that
evening
there
were
dogs
and
guinea
pigs
rats
and
mice
a
menagerie
that
would
have
delighted
a
small
boy
it
did
not
look
like
the
same
old
laboratory
for
the
investigation
of
criminal
science
though
i
saw
on
a
second
glance
that
it
was
the
same
that
there
was
the
usual
of
microscopes
and
all
the
paraphernalia
that
were
so
mystifying
at
first
but
in
the
end
under
his
skilful
hand
made
the
most
complicated
cases
seem
stupidly
simple
craig
smiled
at
my
surprise
i
making
a
little
study
of
intestinal
poisons
he
commented
poisons
produced
by
microbes
which
we
keep
under
more
or
less
control
in
healthy
life
in
death
they
are
the
little
fellows
that
extend
all
over
the
body
and
putrefy
it
we
nourish
within
ourselves
microbes
which
secrete
very
virulent
poisons
and
when
those
poisons
are
too
much
for
us
well
we
grow
old
at
least
that
is
the
theory
of
metchnikoff
who
says
that
old
age
is
an
infectious
chronic
disease
somehow
he
added
thoughtfully
that
beautiful
white
kitchen
in
the
pitts
home
had
really
become
a
factory
for
intestinal
poisons
there
was
an
air
of
suppressed
excitement
in
his
manner
which
told
me
that
kennedy
was
on
the
trail
of
something
unusual
mouth
murder
he
cried
at
length
that
was
what
was
being
done
in
that
wonderful
kitchen
do
you
know
the
scientific
slaying
of
human
beings
has
far
exceeded
organised
efforts
at
detection
of
course
you
expect
me
to
say
that
you
think
i
look
at
such
things
through
coloured
glasses
but
it
is
a
fact
nevertheless
it
is
a
very
simple
matter
for
the
police
to
apprehend
the
common
murderer
whose
weapon
is
a
knife
or
a
gun
but
it
is
a
different
thing
when
they
investigate
the
death
of
a
person
who
has
been
the
victim
of
the
modern
murderer
who
slays
let
us
say
with
some
kind
of
deadly
bacilli
authorities
say
and
i
agree
with
them
that
hundreds
of
murders
are
committed
in
this
country
every
year
and
are
not
detected
because
the
detectives
are
not
scientists
while
the
slayers
have
used
the
knowledge
of
the
scientists
both
to
commit
and
to
cover
up
the
crimes
i
tell
you
walter
a
murder
science
bureau
not
only
would
clear
up
nearly
every
poison
mystery
but
also
it
would
inspire
such
a
wholesome
fear
among
murderers
that
they
would
abandon
many
attempts
to
take
life
he
was
as
excited
over
the
case
as
i
had
ever
seen
him
indeed
it
was
one
that
evidently
taxed
his
utmost
powers
what
have
you
found
i
asked
startled
you
remember
my
use
of
the
sphygmomanometer
he
asked
in
the
first
place
that
put
me
on
what
seems
to
be
a
clear
trail
the
most
dreaded
of
all
the
ills
of
the
cardiac
and
vascular
systems
nowadays
seems
to
be
or
hardening
of
the
arteries
it
is
possible
for
a
man
of
like
pitts
to
have
arteries
in
a
condition
which
would
not
be
encountered
normally
in
persons
under
seventy
years
of
age
the
hard
or
hardening
artery
means
increased
blood
pressure
with
a
consequent
increased
strain
on
the
heart
this
may
lead
has
led
in
this
case
to
a
long
train
of
distressing
symptoms
and
of
course
to
ultimate
death
heart
disease
according
to
statistics
is
carrying
off
a
greater
percentage
of
persons
than
formerly
this
fact
can
not
be
denied
and
it
is
attributed
largely
to
worry
the
abnormal
rush
of
the
life
of
and
sometimes
to
faulty
methods
of
eating
and
bad
nutrition
on
the
surface
these
natural
causes
might
seem
to
be
at
work
with
pitts
but
walter
i
do
not
believe
it
i
do
not
believe
it
there
is
more
than
that
here
come
i
can
do
nothing
more
until
i
learn
more
from
these
animals
and
the
cultures
which
i
have
in
these
tubes
let
us
take
a
turn
or
two
then
dine
and
perhaps
we
may
get
some
word
at
our
apartment
from
edward
it
was
late
that
night
when
a
gentle
tap
at
the
door
proved
that
kennedy
hope
had
not
been
unfounded
i
opened
it
and
let
in
edward
the
valet
who
produced
the
fragments
of
a
note
torn
and
crumpled
there
is
nothing
new
sir
he
explained
except
that
pitts
seems
more
nervous
than
ever
and
pitts
i
think
is
feeling
a
little
brighter
kennedy
said
nothing
but
was
hard
at
work
with
puckered
brows
at
piecing
together
the
note
which
edward
had
obtained
after
hunting
through
the
house
it
had
been
thrown
into
a
fireplace
in
own
room
and
only
by
chance
had
part
of
it
been
unconsumed
the
body
of
the
note
was
gone
altogether
but
the
first
part
and
the
last
part
remained
apparently
it
had
been
written
the
very
morning
on
which
the
murder
was
discovered
it
read
simply
i
have
succeeded
in
having
thornton
declared
then
there
was
a
break
the
last
words
were
legible
and
were
confined
in
a
suitable
institution
where
he
can
cause
no
future
harm
there
was
no
signature
as
if
the
sender
had
perfectly
understood
that
the
receiver
would
understand
not
difficult
to
supply
some
of
the
context
at
any
rate
mused
kennedy
whoever
thornton
may
be
some
one
has
succeeded
in
having
him
declared
i
should
supply
if
he
is
in
an
institution
near
new
york
we
must
be
able
to
locate
him
edward
this
is
a
very
important
clue
there
is
nothing
else
kennedy
employed
the
remainder
of
the
night
in
obtaining
a
list
of
all
the
institutions
both
public
and
private
within
a
considerable
radius
of
the
city
where
the
insane
might
be
detained
the
next
morning
after
an
hour
or
so
spent
in
the
laboratory
apparently
in
confirming
some
control
tests
which
kennedy
had
laid
out
to
make
sure
that
he
was
not
going
wrong
in
the
line
of
inquiry
he
was
pursuing
we
started
off
in
a
series
of
flying
visits
to
the
various
sanitaria
about
the
city
in
search
of
an
inmate
named
thornton
i
will
not
attempt
to
describe
the
many
curious
sights
and
experiences
we
saw
and
had
i
could
readily
believe
that
any
one
who
spent
even
as
little
time
as
we
did
might
almost
think
that
the
very
world
was
going
rapidly
insane
there
were
literally
thousands
of
names
in
the
lists
which
we
examined
patiently
going
through
them
all
since
kennedy
was
not
at
all
sure
that
thornton
might
not
be
a
first
name
and
we
had
no
time
to
waste
on
taking
any
chances
it
was
not
until
long
after
dusk
that
weary
with
the
search
and
from
our
hasty
scouring
of
the
country
in
an
automobile
which
kennedy
had
hired
after
exhausting
the
city
institutions
we
came
to
a
small
private
asylum
up
in
westchester
i
had
almost
been
willing
to
give
it
up
for
the
day
to
start
afresh
on
the
morrow
but
kennedy
seemed
to
feel
that
the
case
was
too
urgent
to
lose
even
twelve
hours
over
it
was
a
peculiar
place
isolated
and
guarded
by
a
high
brick
wall
that
enclosed
a
pretty
good
sized
garden
a
ring
at
the
bell
brought
a
maid
to
the
door
have
you
er
any
one
here
named
thornton
er
kennedy
paused
in
such
a
way
that
if
it
were
the
last
name
he
might
come
to
a
full
stop
and
if
it
were
a
first
name
he
could
go
on
there
is
a
thornton
who
came
yesterday
she
snapped
ungraciously
but
you
can
not
see
him
it
against
the
rules
yes
yesterday
repeated
kennedy
eagerly
ignoring
her
tartness
could
i
he
slipped
a
crumpled
treasury
note
into
her
hand
could
i
speak
to
thornton
nurse
the
note
seemed
to
render
the
acidity
of
the
girl
slightly
alkaline
she
opened
the
door
a
little
further
and
we
found
ourselves
in
a
plainly
furnished
reception
room
alone
we
might
have
been
in
the
of
a
prosperous
country
gentleman
so
quiet
was
it
there
was
none
of
the
raving
as
far
as
i
could
make
out
that
i
should
have
expected
even
in
a
twentieth
century
bedlam
no
material
for
a
poe
story
of
tarr
and
professor
feather
at
length
the
hall
door
opened
and
a
man
entered
not
a
prepossessing
man
it
is
true
with
his
large
and
powerful
hands
and
arms
and
slightly
bowed
almost
bulldog
legs
yet
he
was
not
of
that
aggressive
kind
which
would
make
a
show
of
physical
strength
without
good
and
sufficient
cause
you
have
charge
of
mr
thornton
inquired
kennedy
yes
was
the
curt
response
i
trust
he
is
all
right
here
he
would
be
here
if
he
was
all
right
was
the
quick
reply
and
who
might
you
be
i
knew
him
in
the
old
days
replied
craig
evasively
my
friend
here
does
not
know
him
but
i
was
in
this
part
of
westchester
visiting
and
having
heard
he
was
here
thought
i
would
drop
in
just
for
old
sake
that
is
all
how
did
you
know
he
was
here
asked
the
man
suspiciously
i
heard
indirectly
from
a
friend
of
mine
mrs
pitts
oh
the
man
seemed
to
accept
the
explanation
at
its
face
value
is
he
very
very
badly
asked
craig
with
interest
well
replied
the
man
a
little
mollified
by
a
good
cigar
which
i
produced
do
you
go
her
but
if
he
says
the
name
minna
once
a
day
it
is
a
thousand
times
them
has
some
strange
delusions
strange
delusions
queried
craig
why
what
do
you
mean
say
ejaculated
the
man
i
do
know
you
you
come
here
saying
you
friends
of
thornton
how
do
i
know
what
you
are
well
ventured
kennedy
suppose
i
should
also
tell
you
i
am
a
friend
of
the
man
who
committed
him
of
thompson
lord
exactly
my
friend
here
knows
lord
very
well
do
you
walter
thus
appealed
to
i
hastened
to
add
indeed
i
do
then
improving
the
opening
i
hastened
is
this
thornton
violent
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
most
quiet
institutions
i
ever
saw
for
so
small
a
place
the
man
shook
his
head
because
i
added
i
thought
some
drug
fiends
were
violent
and
had
to
be
restrained
by
force
often
you
wo
find
a
mark
or
a
scratch
on
him
sir
replied
the
man
that
ai
our
system
not
a
mark
or
scratch
on
him
repeated
kennedy
thoughtfully
i
wonder
if
he
recognise
me
ca
say
concluded
the
man
what
more
ca
try
it
against
the
rules
only
your
knowing
so
many
he
knows
has
got
you
this
far
you
have
to
call
on
a
regular
day
or
by
appointment
to
see
him
gentlemen
there
was
an
air
of
finality
about
the
last
statement
that
made
kennedy
rise
and
move
toward
the
door
with
a
hearty
thank
you
for
your
kindness
and
a
wish
to
be
remembered
to
poor
old
thornton
as
we
climbed
into
the
car
he
poked
me
in
the
ribs
just
as
good
for
the
present
as
if
we
had
seen
him
he
exclaimed
friend
of
pitts
committed
by
lord
no
wounds
then
he
lapsed
into
silence
as
we
sped
back
to
the
city
the
pitts
house
ordered
kennedy
as
we
bowled
along
after
noting
by
his
watch
that
it
was
after
nine
then
to
me
he
added
we
must
see
pitts
once
more
and
alone
we
waited
some
time
after
kennedy
sent
up
word
that
he
would
like
to
see
pitts
at
last
she
appeared
i
thought
she
avoided
eye
and
i
am
sure
that
her
intuition
told
her
that
he
had
some
revelation
to
make
against
which
she
was
steeling
herself
craig
greeted
her
as
reassuringly
as
he
could
but
as
she
sat
nervously
before
us
i
could
see
that
she
was
in
reality
pale
worn
and
anxious
we
have
had
a
rather
hard
day
began
kennedy
after
the
usual
polite
inquiries
about
her
own
and
her
husband
health
had
been
i
thought
a
little
prolonged
by
him
indeed
she
asked
have
you
come
any
closer
to
the
truth
kennedy
met
her
eyes
and
she
turned
away
yes
jameson
and
i
have
put
in
the
better
part
of
the
day
in
going
from
one
institution
for
the
insane
to
another
he
paused
the
startled
look
on
her
face
told
as
plainly
as
words
that
his
remark
had
struck
home
without
giving
her
a
chance
to
reply
or
to
think
of
a
verbal
means
of
escape
craig
hurried
on
with
an
account
of
what
we
had
done
saying
nothing
about
the
original
letter
which
had
started
us
on
the
search
for
thornton
but
leaving
it
to
be
inferred
by
her
that
he
knew
much
more
than
he
cared
to
tell
in
short
pitts
he
concluded
firmly
i
do
not
need
to
tell
you
that
i
already
know
much
about
the
matter
which
you
are
concealing
the
piling
up
of
fact
on
fact
mystifying
as
it
was
to
me
who
had
as
yet
no
inkling
of
what
it
was
tending
toward
proved
too
much
for
the
woman
who
knew
the
truth
yet
did
not
know
how
much
kennedy
knew
of
it
minna
pitts
was
pacing
the
floor
wildly
all
the
assumed
manner
of
the
actress
gone
from
her
yet
with
the
native
grace
and
feeling
of
the
born
actress
playing
unrestrained
in
her
actions
you
know
only
part
of
my
story
she
cried
fixing
him
with
her
now
tearless
eyes
it
is
only
a
question
of
time
when
you
will
worm
it
all
out
by
your
uncanny
occult
methods
kennedy
i
cast
myself
on
you
x
the
toxin
of
death
the
note
of
appeal
in
her
tone
was
powerful
but
i
could
not
so
readily
shake
off
my
first
suspicions
of
the
woman
whether
or
not
she
convinced
kennedy
he
did
not
show
i
was
only
a
young
girl
when
i
met
thornton
she
raced
on
i
was
not
yet
eighteen
when
we
were
married
too
late
i
found
out
the
curse
of
his
life
and
of
mine
he
was
a
drug
fiend
from
the
very
first
life
with
him
was
insupportable
i
stood
it
as
long
as
i
could
but
when
he
beat
me
because
he
had
no
money
to
buy
drugs
i
left
him
i
gave
myself
up
to
my
career
on
the
stage
later
i
heard
that
he
was
dead
a
suicide
i
worked
day
and
night
slaved
and
rose
in
the
profession
until
at
last
i
met
mr
pitts
she
paused
and
it
was
evident
that
it
was
with
a
struggle
that
she
could
talk
so
three
months
after
i
was
married
to
him
thornton
suddenly
reappeared
from
the
dead
it
seemed
to
me
he
did
not
want
me
back
no
indeed
all
he
wanted
was
money
i
gave
him
money
my
own
money
for
i
made
a
great
deal
in
my
stage
days
but
his
demands
increased
to
silence
him
i
have
paid
him
thousands
he
squandered
them
faster
than
ever
and
finally
when
it
became
unbearable
i
appealed
to
a
friend
that
friend
has
now
succeeded
in
placing
this
man
quietly
in
a
sanitarium
for
the
insane
and
the
murder
of
the
chef
shot
out
kennedy
she
looked
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
in
alarm
before
god
i
know
no
more
of
that
than
does
mr
pitts
was
she
telling
the
truth
would
she
stop
at
anything
to
avoid
the
scandal
and
disgrace
of
the
charge
of
bigamy
was
there
not
something
still
that
she
was
concealing
she
took
refuge
in
the
last
resort
tears
encouraging
as
it
was
to
have
made
such
progress
it
did
not
seem
to
me
that
we
were
much
nearer
after
all
to
the
solution
of
the
mystery
kennedy
as
usual
had
nothing
to
say
until
he
was
absolutely
sure
of
his
ground
he
spent
the
greater
part
of
the
next
day
hard
at
work
over
the
minute
investigations
of
his
laboratory
leaving
me
to
arrange
the
details
of
a
meeting
he
planned
for
that
night
there
were
present
and
pitts
the
former
in
charge
of
lord
the
valet
edward
was
also
there
and
in
a
neighbouring
room
was
thornton
in
charge
of
two
nurses
from
the
sanitarium
thornton
was
a
sad
wreck
of
a
man
now
whatever
he
might
have
been
when
his
blackmail
furnished
him
with
an
unlimited
supply
of
his
favourite
drugs
let
us
go
back
to
the
very
start
of
the
case
began
kennedy
when
we
had
all
assembled
the
murder
of
the
chef
sam
it
seemed
that
the
mere
sound
of
his
voice
electrified
his
little
audience
i
fancied
a
shudder
passed
over
the
slight
form
of
pitts
as
she
must
have
realised
that
this
was
the
point
where
kennedy
had
left
off
in
his
questioning
her
the
night
before
there
is
he
went
on
slowly
a
blood
test
so
delicate
that
one
might
almost
say
that
he
could
identify
a
criminal
by
his
very
the
fingerprints
so
to
speak
of
his
blood
it
was
by
means
of
these
clues
if
i
may
call
them
so
that
i
was
able
to
get
on
the
right
trail
for
the
fact
is
that
a
man
blood
is
not
like
that
of
any
other
living
creature
blood
of
different
men
of
men
and
women
differ
i
believe
that
in
time
we
shall
be
able
to
refine
this
test
to
tell
the
exact
individual
too
what
is
this
principle
it
is
that
the
hemoglobin
or
red
of
the
blood
forms
crystals
that
has
long
been
known
but
working
on
this
fact
reichert
and
professor
brown
of
the
university
of
pennsylvania
have
made
some
wonderful
discoveries
we
could
distinguish
human
from
animal
blood
before
it
is
true
but
the
discovery
of
these
two
scientists
takes
us
much
further
by
means
of
we
can
distinguish
the
blood
of
man
from
that
of
the
animals
and
in
addition
that
of
white
men
from
that
of
negroes
and
other
races
it
is
often
the
only
way
of
differentiating
between
various
kinds
of
blood
the
variations
in
crystals
in
the
blood
are
in
part
of
form
and
in
part
of
molecular
structure
the
latter
being
discovered
only
by
means
of
the
polarising
microscope
a
is
only
one
of
an
inch
in
length
and
one
of
an
inch
in
breadth
and
yet
minute
as
these
crystals
are
this
discovery
is
of
immense
importance
crime
may
now
be
traced
by
he
displayed
on
his
table
a
number
of
enlarged
some
were
labelled
characteristic
crystals
of
white
man
blood
others
crystallisation
of
negro
blood
still
others
of
the
cat
i
have
here
he
resumed
after
we
had
all
examined
the
photographs
and
had
seen
that
there
was
indeed
a
vast
amount
of
difference
three
characteristic
kinds
of
crystals
all
of
which
i
found
in
the
various
spots
in
the
kitchen
of
pitts
there
were
three
kinds
of
blood
by
the
infallible
reichert
test
i
had
been
prepared
for
his
discovery
of
two
kinds
but
three
heightened
the
mystery
still
more
there
was
only
a
very
little
of
the
blood
which
was
that
of
the
poor
faithful
unfortunate
sam
the
negro
chef
kennedy
went
on
a
little
more
found
far
from
his
body
is
that
of
a
white
person
but
most
of
it
is
not
human
blood
at
all
it
was
the
blood
of
a
cat
the
revelation
was
startling
before
any
of
us
could
ask
he
hastened
to
explain
it
was
placed
there
by
some
one
who
wished
to
exaggerate
the
struggle
in
order
to
divert
suspicion
that
person
had
indeed
been
wounded
slightly
but
wished
it
to
appear
that
the
wounds
were
very
serious
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
is
spotted
deeply
with
blood
but
it
is
not
human
blood
it
is
the
blood
of
a
cat
a
few
years
ago
even
a
scientific
detective
would
have
concluded
that
a
fierce
struggle
had
been
waged
and
that
the
murderer
was
perhaps
fatally
wounded
now
another
conclusion
stands
proved
infallibly
by
this
reichert
test
the
murderer
was
wounded
but
not
badly
that
person
even
went
out
of
the
room
and
returned
later
probably
with
a
can
of
animal
blood
sprinkled
it
about
to
give
the
appearance
of
a
struggle
perhaps
thought
of
preparing
in
this
way
a
plea
of
if
that
latter
was
the
case
this
reichert
test
completely
destroys
it
clever
though
it
was
no
one
spoke
but
the
same
thought
was
openly
in
all
our
minds
who
was
this
wounded
criminal
i
asked
myself
the
usual
query
of
the
lawyers
and
the
detectives
who
would
benefit
most
by
the
death
of
pitts
there
was
but
one
answer
apparently
to
that
it
was
minna
pitts
yet
it
was
difficult
for
me
to
believe
that
a
woman
of
her
ordinary
gentleness
could
be
here
faced
even
by
so
great
exposure
yet
be
so
solicitous
for
him
as
she
had
been
and
then
at
the
same
time
be
plotting
against
him
i
gave
it
up
determining
to
let
kennedy
unravel
it
in
his
own
way
craig
evidently
had
the
same
thought
in
his
mind
however
for
he
continued
was
it
a
woman
who
killed
the
chef
no
for
the
third
specimen
of
blood
that
of
the
white
person
was
the
blood
of
a
man
not
of
a
woman
pitts
had
been
following
closely
his
unnatural
eyes
now
gleaming
you
said
he
was
wounded
you
remember
he
interrupted
as
if
casting
about
in
his
mind
to
recall
some
one
who
bore
a
recent
wound
perhaps
it
was
not
a
bad
wound
but
it
was
a
wound
nevertheless
and
some
one
must
have
seen
it
must
know
about
it
it
is
not
three
days
kennedy
shook
his
head
it
was
a
point
that
had
bothered
him
a
great
deal
as
to
the
wounds
he
added
in
a
measured
tone
although
this
occurred
scarcely
three
days
ago
there
is
no
person
even
remotely
suspected
of
the
crime
who
can
be
said
to
bear
on
his
hands
or
face
others
than
old
scars
of
wounds
he
paused
then
he
shot
out
in
quick
staccato
did
you
ever
hear
of
carrel
most
recent
discovery
of
accelerating
the
healing
of
wounds
so
that
those
which
under
ordinary
circumstances
might
take
ten
days
to
heal
might
be
healed
in
hours
rapidly
now
he
sketched
the
theory
if
the
factors
that
bring
about
the
multiplication
of
cells
and
the
growth
of
tissues
were
discovered
carrel
said
to
himself
it
would
perhaps
become
possible
to
hasten
artificially
the
process
of
repair
of
the
body
aseptic
wounds
could
probably
be
made
to
cicatrise
more
rapidly
if
the
rate
of
reparation
of
tissue
were
hastened
only
ten
times
a
skin
wound
would
heal
in
less
than
hours
and
a
fracture
of
the
leg
in
four
or
five
days
for
five
years
carrel
has
been
studying
the
subject
applying
various
extracts
to
wounded
tissues
all
of
them
increased
the
growth
of
connective
tissue
but
the
degree
of
acceleration
varied
greatly
in
some
cases
it
was
as
high
as
forty
times
the
normal
dream
of
ten
times
the
normal
was
exceeded
by
himself
astounded
as
we
were
by
this
revelation
kennedy
did
not
seem
to
consider
it
as
important
as
one
that
he
was
now
hastening
to
show
us
he
took
a
few
cubic
centimetres
of
some
culture
which
he
had
been
preparing
placed
it
in
a
tube
and
poured
in
eight
or
ten
drops
of
sulphuric
acid
he
shook
it
i
have
here
a
culture
from
some
of
the
food
that
i
found
was
being
or
had
been
prepared
for
pitts
it
was
in
the
icebox
then
he
took
another
tube
this
he
remarked
is
a
solution
of
sodium
nitrite
he
held
it
up
carefully
and
poured
three
or
four
cubic
centimetres
of
it
into
the
first
tube
so
that
it
ran
carefully
down
the
side
in
a
manner
such
as
to
form
a
sharp
line
of
contact
between
the
heavier
culture
with
the
acid
and
the
lighter
nitrite
solution
you
see
he
said
the
reaction
is
very
clear
cut
if
you
do
it
this
way
the
ordinary
method
in
the
laboratory
and
the
is
crude
and
uncertain
what
is
it
asked
pitts
eagerly
leaning
forward
with
unwonted
strength
and
noting
the
pink
colour
that
appeared
at
the
junction
of
the
two
liquids
contrasting
sharply
with
the
portions
above
and
below
the
ring
or
contact
test
for
indol
kennedy
replied
with
evident
satisfaction
when
the
acid
and
the
nitrites
are
mixed
the
colour
reaction
is
unsatisfactory
the
natural
yellow
tint
masks
that
pink
tint
or
sometimes
causes
it
to
disappear
if
the
tube
is
shaken
but
this
is
simple
clear
delicate
unescapable
there
was
indol
in
that
food
of
yours
mr
pitts
indol
repeated
pitts
is
explained
kennedy
a
chemical
compound
one
of
the
toxins
secreted
by
intestinal
bacteria
and
responsible
for
many
of
the
symptoms
of
senility
it
used
to
be
thought
that
large
doses
of
indol
might
be
consumed
with
little
or
no
effect
on
normal
man
but
now
we
know
that
headache
insomnia
confusion
irritability
decreased
activity
of
the
cells
and
intoxication
are
possible
from
it
comparatively
small
doses
over
a
long
time
produce
changes
in
organs
that
lead
to
serious
results
it
is
went
on
kennedy
as
the
full
horror
of
the
thing
sank
into
our
minds
the
bacteria
which
are
the
undesirable
citizens
of
the
body
while
the
producing
germs
check
the
production
of
indol
and
phenol
in
my
tests
here
i
injected
four
of
a
grain
of
indol
into
a
the
animal
had
sclerosis
or
hardening
of
the
aorta
the
liver
kidneys
and
were
affected
and
there
was
a
hardening
of
the
brain
in
short
there
were
all
the
symptoms
of
old
age
we
sat
aghast
indol
what
black
magic
was
this
who
put
it
in
the
food
it
is
present
continued
craig
in
much
larger
quantities
than
all
the
metchnikoff
germs
could
neutralise
what
the
chef
was
ordered
to
put
into
the
food
to
benefit
you
pitts
was
rendered
valueless
and
a
deadly
poison
was
added
by
what
another
minna
pitts
had
been
clutching
for
support
at
the
arms
of
her
chair
as
kennedy
proceeded
she
now
threw
herself
at
the
feet
of
emery
pitts
forgive
me
she
sobbed
i
can
stand
it
no
longer
i
had
tried
to
keep
this
thing
about
thornton
from
you
i
have
tried
to
make
you
happy
and
well
oh
tried
so
hard
so
faithfully
yet
that
old
skeleton
of
my
past
which
i
thought
was
buried
would
not
stay
buried
i
have
bought
thornton
off
again
and
again
with
money
my
money
only
to
find
him
threatening
again
but
about
this
other
thing
this
poison
i
am
as
innocent
and
i
believe
thornton
is
as
craig
laid
a
gentle
hand
on
her
lips
she
rose
wildly
and
faced
him
in
passionate
appeal
who
who
is
this
thornton
demanded
emery
pitts
quickly
delicately
sparing
her
as
much
as
he
could
craig
hurried
over
our
experiences
he
is
in
the
next
room
craig
went
on
then
facing
pitts
added
with
you
alive
emery
pitts
this
blackmail
of
your
wife
might
have
gone
on
although
there
was
always
the
danger
that
you
might
hear
of
it
and
do
as
i
see
you
have
already
done
forgive
and
plan
to
right
the
unfortunate
mistake
but
with
you
dead
this
thornton
or
rather
some
one
using
him
might
take
away
from
minna
pitts
her
whole
interest
in
your
estate
at
a
word
the
law
or
your
heirs
at
law
would
never
forgive
as
you
would
pitts
long
poisoned
by
the
subtle
microbic
poison
stared
at
kennedy
as
if
dazed
who
was
caught
in
your
kitchen
pitts
and
to
escape
detection
killed
your
faithful
chef
and
covered
his
own
traces
so
cleverly
rapped
out
kennedy
who
would
have
known
the
new
process
of
healing
wounds
who
knew
about
the
fatal
properties
of
indol
who
was
willing
to
forego
a
prize
in
order
to
gain
a
fortune
of
many
hundreds
of
thousands
kennedy
paused
then
finished
with
irresistibly
dramatic
logic
who
else
but
the
man
who
held
the
secret
of
minna
pitts
past
and
power
over
her
future
so
long
as
he
could
keep
alive
the
unfortunate
thornton
the
doctor
who
substituted
an
elixir
of
death
at
night
for
the
elixir
of
life
prescribed
for
you
by
him
in
the
daytime
dr
lord
kennedy
had
moved
quietly
toward
the
door
it
was
unnecessary
lord
was
cornered
and
knew
it
he
made
no
fight
in
fact
instantly
his
keen
mind
was
busy
outlining
his
battle
in
court
relying
on
the
conflicting
testimony
of
hired
experts
minna
murmured
pitts
falling
back
exhausted
by
the
excitement
on
his
pillows
minna
forgive
what
is
there
to
forgive
the
only
thing
to
do
is
to
correct
i
shall
be
well
soon
now
my
dear
then
all
will
be
straightened
out
walter
whispered
kennedy
to
me
while
we
are
waiting
you
can
arrange
to
have
thornton
cared
for
at
hodge
sanitarium
he
handed
me
a
card
with
the
directions
where
to
take
the
unfortunate
man
when
at
last
i
had
thornton
placed
where
no
one
else
could
do
any
harm
through
him
i
hastened
back
to
the
laboratory
craig
was
still
there
waiting
alone
that
lord
will
be
a
tough
customer
he
remarked
of
course
you
not
interested
in
what
happens
in
a
case
after
we
have
caught
the
criminal
but
that
often
is
really
only
the
beginning
of
the
fight
we
got
him
safely
lodged
in
the
tombs
now
however
i
wish
there
was
some
elixir
for
fatigue
i
remarked
as
we
closed
the
laboratory
that
night
there
is
he
replied
a
homeopathic
remedy
more
fatigue
we
started
on
our
usual
brisk
roundabout
walk
to
the
apartment
but
instead
of
going
to
bed
kennedy
drew
a
book
from
the
bookcase
i
shall
read
myself
to
sleep
he
explained
settling
deeply
in
his
chair
as
for
me
i
went
directly
to
my
room
planning
that
i
would
take
several
hours
off
and
catch
up
in
my
notes
that
morning
kennedy
was
summoned
downtown
and
had
to
interrupt
more
important
duties
in
order
to
appear
before
leslie
in
the
inquest
over
the
death
of
the
chef
lord
was
held
for
the
grand
jury
but
it
was
not
until
nearly
noon
that
craig
returned
we
were
just
about
to
go
out
to
luncheon
when
the
door
buzzer
sounded
a
note
for
kennedy
announced
a
man
in
a
police
uniform
with
a
blue
anchor
edged
with
white
on
his
coat
sleeve
craig
tore
open
the
envelope
quickly
with
his
forefinger
headed
harbour
police
station
no
staten
island
was
an
urgent
message
from
our
old
friend
deputy
commissioner
i
have
taken
personal
charge
of
a
case
here
that
is
sufficiently
out
of
the
ordinary
to
interest
you
i
read
when
kennedy
tossed
the
note
over
to
me
and
nodded
to
the
man
from
the
harbour
squad
to
wait
for
us
the
curtis
family
wish
to
retain
a
private
detective
to
work
in
conjunction
with
the
police
in
investigating
the
death
of
bertha
curtis
whose
body
was
found
this
morning
in
the
waters
of
kill
van
kull
kennedy
and
i
lost
no
time
in
starting
downtown
with
the
policeman
who
had
brought
the
note
the
curtises
as
we
knew
were
among
the
prominent
families
of
manhattan
and
i
recalled
having
heard
that
at
one
time
bertha
curtis
had
been
an
actress
in
spite
of
the
means
and
social
position
of
her
family
from
whom
she
had
become
estranged
as
a
result
at
the
station
of
the
harbour
police
and
another
man
who
was
in
a
state
of
extreme
excitement
greeted
us
almost
before
we
had
landed
there
have
been
some
queer
doings
about
here
exclaimed
the
deputy
as
he
grasped
kennedy
hand
but
first
of
all
let
me
introduce
walker
curtis
in
a
lower
tone
as
we
walked
up
the
dock
continued
he
is
the
brother
of
the
girl
whose
body
the
men
in
the
launch
at
the
station
found
in
the
kill
this
morning
they
thought
at
first
that
the
girl
had
committed
suicide
making
it
doubly
sure
by
jumping
into
the
water
but
he
will
not
believe
it
and
well
if
you
just
come
over
with
us
to
the
local
undertaking
establishment
i
like
to
have
you
take
a
look
at
the
body
and
see
if
your
opinion
coincides
with
mine
ordinarily
pursued
there
is
much
romance
in
harbour
police
work
nowadays
but
in
this
case
some
other
elements
seem
to
be
present
which
are
not
usually
associated
with
violent
deaths
in
the
waters
of
the
bay
and
i
have
as
you
will
see
thought
it
necessary
to
take
personal
charge
of
the
investigation
now
to
shorten
the
story
as
much
as
possible
kennedy
you
know
of
course
that
the
legislature
at
the
last
session
enacted
laws
prohibiting
the
sale
of
such
drugs
as
opium
morphine
cocaine
chloral
and
others
under
much
heavier
penalties
than
before
the
health
authorities
not
long
ago
reported
to
us
that
dope
was
being
sold
almost
openly
without
orders
from
physicians
at
several
scores
of
places
and
we
have
begun
a
crusade
for
the
enforcement
of
the
law
of
course
you
know
how
prohibition
works
in
many
places
and
how
the
law
is
beaten
the
dope
fiends
seem
to
be
doing
the
same
thing
with
this
law
of
course
nowadays
everybody
talks
about
a
controlling
everything
so
i
suppose
people
would
say
that
there
is
a
trust
at
any
rate
we
have
run
up
against
at
least
a
number
of
places
that
seem
to
be
banded
together
in
some
way
from
the
lowest
down
in
chinatown
to
one
very
swell
joint
uptown
around
what
the
newspapers
are
calling
square
it
is
not
that
this
place
is
pandering
to
criminals
or
the
women
of
the
tenderloin
that
interests
us
so
much
as
that
its
patrons
are
men
and
women
of
fashionable
society
whose
jangled
nerves
seem
to
demand
a
strong
narcotic
this
particular
place
seems
to
be
a
headquarters
for
obtaining
them
especially
opium
and
its
derivatives
one
of
the
frequenters
of
the
place
was
this
unfortunate
girl
bertha
curtis
i
have
watched
her
go
in
and
out
myself
nervous
mentally
and
physically
wrecked
for
life
perhaps
or
thirty
persons
visit
the
place
each
day
it
is
run
by
a
man
known
as
jack
clendenin
who
was
once
an
actor
and
i
believe
met
and
fascinated
miss
curtis
during
her
brief
career
on
the
stage
he
has
an
attendant
there
a
jap
named
nichi
moto
who
is
a
perfect
enigma
i
ca
understand
him
on
any
reasonable
theory
a
long
time
ago
we
raided
the
place
and
packed
up
a
lot
of
opium
pipes
material
and
other
stuff
we
found
clendenin
there
this
girl
several
others
and
the
jap
i
never
understood
just
how
it
was
but
somehow
clendenin
got
off
with
a
nominal
fine
and
a
few
days
later
opened
up
again
we
were
watching
the
place
getting
ready
to
raid
it
again
and
present
such
evidence
that
clendenin
could
possibly
beat
it
when
all
of
a
sudden
along
came
this
this
tragedy
we
had
at
last
arrived
at
the
private
establishment
which
was
doing
duty
as
a
morgue
the
bedraggled
form
that
had
been
bandied
about
by
the
tides
all
night
lay
covered
up
in
the
cold
damp
basement
bertha
curtis
had
been
a
girl
of
striking
beauty
once
for
a
long
time
i
gazed
at
the
swollen
features
before
i
realised
what
it
was
that
fascinated
and
puzzled
me
about
her
kennedy
however
after
a
casual
glance
had
arrived
at
at
least
a
part
of
her
story
that
girl
he
whispered
to
me
so
that
her
brother
could
not
hear
has
led
a
pretty
fast
life
look
at
those
nails
yellow
and
dark
it
is
a
weak
face
either
i
would
be
surprised
if
the
whole
thing
the
oriental
glamour
and
all
that
fascinated
her
as
much
as
the
drug
so
far
the
case
with
its
heartrending
tragedy
had
all
the
earmarks
of
suicide
xi
the
opium
joint
drew
back
the
sheet
which
covered
her
and
in
the
calf
of
the
leg
disclosed
an
ugly
bullet
hole
ugly
as
it
was
however
it
was
anything
but
dangerous
and
seemed
to
indicate
nothing
as
to
the
real
cause
of
her
death
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
slightly
misshapen
bullet
which
had
been
probed
from
the
wound
and
handed
it
to
kennedy
who
examined
both
the
wound
and
the
bullet
carefully
it
seemed
to
be
an
ordinary
bullet
except
that
in
the
pointed
end
were
three
or
four
little
round
very
shallow
wells
or
depressions
only
the
minutest
fraction
of
an
inch
deep
very
extraordinary
he
remarked
slowly
no
i
do
think
this
was
a
case
of
suicide
nor
was
it
a
murder
for
money
else
the
jewels
would
have
been
taken
looked
approvingly
at
me
exactly
what
i
said
he
exclaimed
she
was
dead
before
her
body
was
thrown
into
the
water
no
i
do
agree
with
you
there
corrected
craig
continuing
his
examination
of
the
body
and
yet
it
is
not
a
case
of
drowning
exactly
either
strangled
suggested
by
some
jiu
jitsu
trick
i
put
in
mindful
of
the
jap
at
clendenin
kennedy
shook
his
head
perhaps
the
shock
of
the
bullet
wound
rendered
her
unconscious
and
in
that
state
she
was
thrown
in
ventured
walker
curtis
apparently
much
relieved
that
kennedy
coincided
with
in
disagreeing
with
the
harbour
police
as
to
the
suicide
theory
kennedy
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
looked
at
the
bullet
again
it
is
very
extraordinary
was
all
he
replied
i
think
you
said
a
few
moments
ago
that
there
had
been
some
queer
doings
about
here
what
did
you
mean
well
as
i
said
the
work
of
the
harbour
squad
is
ordinarily
very
remarkable
harbour
pirates
are
murderous
as
a
rule
any
more
for
the
most
part
they
are
plain
sneak
thieves
or
bogus
junk
dealers
who
work
with
dishonest
pier
watchmen
and
crooked
canal
boat
captains
and
lighter
hands
but
in
this
instance
continued
the
deputy
his
face
knitting
at
the
thought
that
he
had
to
confess
another
mystery
to
which
he
had
no
solution
it
is
something
quite
different
you
know
that
all
along
the
shore
on
this
side
of
the
island
are
old
dilapidated
and
some
of
them
deserted
houses
for
several
days
the
residents
of
the
neighbourhood
have
been
complaining
of
strange
occurrences
about
one
place
in
particular
which
was
the
home
of
a
wealthy
family
in
a
past
generation
it
is
about
a
mile
from
here
facing
the
road
along
the
shore
and
has
in
front
of
it
and
across
the
road
the
remains
of
an
old
dock
sticking
out
a
few
feet
into
the
water
at
high
tide
now
as
nearly
as
any
one
can
get
the
story
there
seems
to
have
been
a
mysterious
phantom
boat
very
swift
without
lights
and
with
an
engine
carefully
muffled
down
which
has
been
coming
up
to
the
old
dock
for
the
past
few
nights
when
the
tide
was
high
enough
a
light
has
been
seen
moving
on
the
dock
then
suddenly
extinguished
only
to
reappear
again
who
carried
it
and
why
no
one
knows
any
one
who
has
tried
to
approach
the
place
has
had
a
scare
thrown
into
him
which
he
will
not
easily
forget
for
instance
one
man
crept
up
and
though
he
did
not
think
he
was
seen
he
was
suddenly
shot
at
from
behind
a
tree
he
felt
the
bullet
pierce
his
arm
started
to
run
stumbled
and
next
morning
woke
up
in
the
exact
spot
on
which
he
had
fallen
none
the
worse
for
his
experience
except
that
he
had
a
slight
wound
that
will
prevent
his
using
his
right
arm
for
some
time
for
heavy
work
after
each
visit
of
the
phantom
boat
there
is
heard
according
to
the
story
of
the
few
neighbours
who
have
observed
it
the
tramp
of
feet
up
the
overgrown
stone
walk
from
the
dock
and
some
have
said
that
they
heard
an
automobile
as
silent
and
ghostly
as
the
boat
we
have
been
all
through
the
weird
old
house
but
have
found
nothing
there
except
enough
loose
boards
and
shutters
to
account
for
almost
any
noise
or
combination
of
noises
however
no
one
has
said
there
was
anything
there
except
the
tramp
of
feet
going
back
and
forth
on
the
old
pavements
outside
two
or
three
times
shots
have
been
heard
and
on
the
dock
where
most
of
the
alleged
mysterious
doings
have
taken
place
we
have
found
one
very
new
exploded
shell
of
a
cartridge
craig
took
the
shell
which
drew
from
another
pocket
and
trying
to
fit
the
bullet
and
the
cartridge
together
remarked
both
from
a
probably
one
of
those
makes
there
concluded
ruefully
you
know
all
we
know
of
the
thing
so
far
i
may
keep
these
for
the
present
inquired
kennedy
preparing
to
pocket
the
shell
and
the
bullet
and
from
his
very
manner
i
could
see
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
already
knew
a
great
deal
more
about
the
case
than
the
police
take
us
down
to
this
old
house
and
dock
if
you
please
over
and
over
craig
paced
up
and
down
the
dilapidated
dock
his
keen
eyes
fastened
to
the
ground
seeking
some
clue
anything
that
would
point
to
the
marauders
real
persons
they
certainly
were
and
not
any
ghostly
crew
of
the
bygone
days
of
harbour
pirates
for
there
was
every
evidence
of
some
one
who
had
gone
up
and
down
the
walk
recently
not
once
but
many
times
suddenly
kennedy
stumbled
over
what
looked
like
a
sardine
tin
can
except
that
it
had
no
label
or
trace
of
one
it
was
lying
in
the
thick
long
matted
grass
by
the
side
of
the
walk
as
if
it
had
tumbled
there
and
had
been
left
unnoticed
yet
there
was
nothing
so
very
remarkable
about
it
in
itself
tin
cans
were
lying
all
about
those
marks
of
decadent
civilisation
but
to
craig
it
had
instantly
presented
an
idea
it
was
a
new
can
the
others
were
rusted
he
had
pried
off
the
lid
and
inside
was
a
blackish
viscous
mass
smoking
opium
craig
said
at
last
we
retraced
our
steps
pondering
on
the
significance
of
the
discovery
had
had
men
out
endeavouring
all
day
to
get
a
clue
to
the
motor
car
that
had
been
mentioned
in
some
of
the
accounts
given
by
the
natives
so
far
the
best
he
had
been
able
to
find
was
a
report
of
a
large
red
touring
car
which
crossed
from
new
york
on
a
late
ferry
in
it
were
a
man
and
a
girl
as
well
as
a
chauffeur
who
wore
goggles
and
a
cap
pulled
down
over
his
head
so
that
he
was
practically
unrecognisable
the
girl
might
have
been
miss
curtis
and
as
for
the
man
it
might
have
been
clendenin
no
one
had
bothered
much
with
them
no
one
had
taken
their
number
no
one
had
paid
any
attention
where
they
went
after
the
ferry
landed
in
fact
there
would
have
been
no
significance
to
the
report
if
it
had
not
been
learned
that
early
in
the
morning
on
the
first
ferry
from
the
lower
end
of
the
island
to
new
jersey
a
large
red
touring
car
answering
about
the
same
description
had
crossed
with
a
single
man
and
driver
but
no
woman
i
should
like
to
watch
here
with
you
said
craig
as
we
parted
meet
us
here
in
the
meantime
i
shall
call
on
jameson
with
his
newspaper
connections
in
the
white
light
district
here
he
gave
me
a
half
facetious
wink
to
see
what
he
can
do
toward
getting
me
admitted
to
this
gilded
palace
of
dope
up
there
on
street
after
no
little
trouble
kennedy
and
i
discovered
our
hop
joint
and
were
admitted
by
nichi
moto
of
whom
we
had
heard
kennedy
gave
me
a
final
injunction
to
watch
but
to
be
very
careful
not
to
seem
to
watch
nichi
moto
with
an
eye
to
business
and
not
to
our
absorbing
more
than
enough
to
whet
our
descriptive
powers
quickly
conducted
us
into
a
large
room
where
on
single
bamboo
couches
or
bunks
rather
tastefully
made
perhaps
half
a
dozen
habitues
lay
stretched
at
full
length
smoking
their
pipes
in
peace
or
preparing
them
in
great
expectation
from
the
implements
on
the
trays
before
them
kennedy
relieved
me
of
the
responsibility
of
cooking
the
opium
by
doing
it
for
both
of
us
and
incidentally
dropping
a
hint
not
to
inhale
it
and
to
breathe
as
little
of
it
as
possible
even
then
it
made
me
feel
badly
though
he
must
have
contrived
in
some
way
to
get
even
less
of
the
stuff
than
i
a
couple
of
pipes
and
kennedy
beckoned
to
nichi
where
is
mr
clendenin
he
asked
familiarly
i
have
seen
him
yet
the
japanese
smiled
his
engaging
smile
not
know
was
all
he
said
and
yet
i
knew
the
fellow
at
least
knew
better
english
if
not
more
facts
kennedy
had
about
started
on
our
faking
a
third
pipe
when
a
new
unexpected
arrival
beckoned
excitedly
to
nichi
i
could
not
catch
all
that
was
said
but
two
words
that
i
did
catch
were
the
boss
and
hop
toy
the
latter
the
word
for
opium
no
sooner
had
the
man
disappeared
without
joining
the
smokers
than
nichi
seemed
to
grow
very
restless
and
anxious
evidently
he
had
received
orders
to
do
something
he
seemed
anxious
to
close
the
place
and
get
away
i
thought
that
some
one
might
have
given
a
tip
that
the
place
was
to
be
raided
but
kennedy
who
had
been
closer
had
overheard
more
than
i
had
and
among
other
things
he
had
caught
the
word
meet
him
at
the
same
place
it
was
not
long
before
we
were
all
politely
hustled
out
at
least
we
know
this
commented
kennedy
as
i
congratulated
myself
on
our
fortunate
escape
clendenin
was
not
there
and
there
is
something
doing
for
he
has
sent
for
nichi
we
dropped
into
our
apartment
to
freshen
up
a
bit
against
the
long
vigil
that
we
knew
was
coming
that
night
to
our
surprise
walker
curtis
had
left
a
message
that
he
wished
to
see
kennedy
immediately
and
alone
and
although
i
was
not
present
i
give
the
substance
of
what
he
said
it
seemed
that
he
had
not
wished
to
tell
for
fear
that
it
would
get
into
the
papers
and
cause
an
even
greater
scandal
but
it
had
come
to
his
knowledge
a
few
days
before
the
tragedy
that
his
sister
was
determined
to
marry
a
very
wealthy
chinese
merchant
an
importer
of
tea
named
chin
jung
whether
or
not
this
had
any
bearing
on
the
case
he
did
not
know
he
thought
it
had
because
for
a
long
time
both
when
she
was
on
the
stage
and
later
clendenin
had
had
a
great
influence
over
her
and
had
watched
with
a
jealous
eye
the
advances
of
every
one
else
curtis
was
especially
bitter
against
clendenin
as
kennedy
related
the
conversation
to
me
on
our
way
over
to
staten
island
i
tried
to
piece
the
thing
together
but
like
one
of
the
famous
chinese
puzzles
it
would
not
come
out
i
had
to
admit
the
possibility
that
it
was
clendenin
who
might
have
quarrelled
over
her
attachment
to
chin
jung
even
though
i
have
never
yet
been
able
to
understand
what
the
fascination
is
that
some
orientals
have
over
certain
american
girls
all
that
night
we
watched
patiently
from
a
vantage
point
of
an
old
shed
near
both
the
house
and
the
decayed
pier
it
was
weird
in
the
extreme
especially
as
we
had
no
idea
what
might
happen
if
we
had
success
and
saw
something
but
there
was
no
reward
for
our
patience
absolutely
nothing
happened
it
was
as
though
they
knew
whoever
they
were
that
we
were
there
during
the
hours
that
passed
whiled
away
the
time
in
a
subdued
whisper
now
and
then
in
telling
us
of
his
experiences
in
chinatown
which
he
was
now
engaged
in
trying
to
clean
up
from
chinatown
its
dens
its
gamblers
and
its
tongs
we
drifted
to
the
legitimate
business
interests
there
and
i
at
least
was
surprised
to
find
that
there
were
some
of
the
merchants
for
whom
even
had
a
great
deal
of
respect
kennedy
evidently
did
not
wish
to
violate
in
any
way
the
confidence
of
walker
curtis
and
mention
of
the
name
of
chin
jung
but
by
a
judicious
question
as
to
who
the
best
men
were
in
the
celestial
settlement
he
did
get
a
list
of
half
a
dozen
or
so
from
chin
jung
was
well
up
in
the
list
however
the
night
wore
away
and
still
nothing
happened
it
was
in
the
middle
of
the
morning
when
we
were
taking
a
snatch
of
sleep
in
our
own
rooms
uptown
that
the
telephone
began
to
ring
insistently
kennedy
who
was
resting
i
verily
believe
merely
out
of
consideration
for
my
own
human
frailties
was
at
the
receiver
in
an
instant
it
proved
to
be
he
had
just
gone
back
to
his
office
at
headquarters
and
there
he
had
found
a
report
of
another
murder
who
is
it
asked
kennedy
and
why
do
you
connect
it
with
this
case
answer
must
have
been
a
poser
judging
from
the
look
of
surprise
on
craig
face
the
jap
nichi
moto
he
repeated
and
it
is
the
same
sort
of
wound
the
same
evidence
of
asphyxia
the
same
circumstances
even
down
to
the
red
car
reported
by
residents
in
the
neighbourhood
nothing
further
happened
that
day
except
this
thickening
of
the
plot
by
the
murder
of
the
nichi
we
saw
his
body
and
it
was
as
said
that
fellow
was
on
the
level
toward
clendenin
craig
mused
after
we
had
viewed
the
second
murder
in
the
case
the
question
is
who
and
what
was
he
working
for
there
was
as
yet
no
hint
of
answer
and
our
only
plan
was
to
watch
again
that
night
this
time
not
knowing
where
the
lightning
would
strike
next
took
craig
suggestion
and
we
determined
to
spend
the
time
cruising
about
in
the
fastest
of
the
police
motor
boats
while
the
force
of
watchers
along
the
entire
shore
front
of
the
city
was
quietly
augmented
and
ordered
to
be
extra
vigilant
at
the
last
moment
had
to
withdraw
and
let
us
go
alone
for
the
worst
and
not
the
unexpected
happened
in
his
effort
to
clean
up
chinatown
the
war
between
the
old
rivals
the
hep
sing
tong
and
the
on
leong
tong
those
ancient
societies
of
troublemakers
in
the
little
district
had
broken
out
afresh
during
the
day
and
three
orientals
had
been
killed
already
it
is
not
a
particularly
pleasant
occupation
cruising
aimlessly
up
and
down
the
harbour
in
a
police
boat
staunch
and
fast
as
she
may
be
every
hour
we
called
at
a
police
post
to
report
and
to
keep
in
touch
with
anything
that
might
interest
us
it
came
at
about
two
in
the
morning
and
of
all
places
near
the
battery
itself
from
the
front
of
a
ferry
boat
that
ran
far
down
on
the
brooklyn
side
what
looked
like
two
flashlights
gleamed
out
over
the
water
once
then
twice
headlights
of
an
automobile
remarked
craig
scarcely
taking
more
notice
of
it
for
they
might
have
simply
been
turned
up
and
down
twice
by
a
late
returning
traveller
to
test
them
we
were
ourselves
near
the
brooklyn
shore
imagine
our
surprise
to
see
an
answering
light
from
a
small
boat
in
the
river
which
was
otherwise
lightless
we
promptly
put
out
our
own
lights
and
with
every
cylinder
working
made
for
the
spot
where
the
light
had
flashed
up
on
the
river
there
was
something
there
all
right
and
we
went
for
it
on
we
raced
after
the
strange
craft
the
phantom
that
had
scared
staten
island
for
a
mile
or
so
we
seemed
to
be
gaining
but
one
of
our
cylinders
began
to
miss
the
boat
turned
sharply
around
a
bend
in
the
shore
we
had
to
give
it
up
as
well
as
trying
to
overtake
the
ferry
boat
going
in
the
opposite
direction
kennedy
equanimity
in
our
apparent
defeat
surprised
me
oh
nothing
walter
he
said
they
slipped
away
but
i
have
found
the
clue
as
soon
as
the
customs
house
is
open
you
will
understand
it
all
centres
about
opium
at
least
a
large
part
of
the
secret
was
cleared
too
as
a
result
of
kennedy
visit
to
the
customs
house
after
years
of
fighting
with
the
opium
ring
on
the
pacific
coast
the
ring
had
tried
to
put
one
over
on
the
revenue
officers
and
smuggle
the
drug
in
through
new
york
it
did
not
take
long
to
find
the
right
man
among
the
revenue
officers
to
talk
with
nor
was
kennedy
surprised
to
learn
that
nichi
moto
had
been
in
fact
a
japanese
detective
a
sort
of
stool
pigeon
in
clendenin
establishment
working
to
keep
the
government
in
touch
with
the
latest
scheme
the
finding
of
the
can
of
opium
on
the
scene
of
the
murder
of
bertha
curtis
and
the
chase
after
the
lightless
motor
boat
had
at
last
placed
kennedy
on
the
right
track
with
one
of
the
revenue
officers
we
made
a
quick
trip
to
brooklyn
and
spent
the
morning
inspecting
the
ships
from
south
american
ports
docked
in
the
neighbourhood
where
the
phantom
boat
had
disappeared
from
ship
to
ship
we
journeyed
until
at
last
we
came
to
one
on
which
down
in
the
chain
locker
we
found
a
false
floor
with
a
locker
under
that
there
was
a
compartment
six
feet
square
and
in
it
lay
neatly
packed
fourteen
large
hermetically
sealed
cylinders
each
full
of
the
little
oblong
tins
such
as
kennedy
had
picked
up
the
other
day
forty
thousand
dollars
worth
of
the
stuff
at
one
haul
to
say
nothing
of
the
thousands
that
had
already
been
landed
at
one
place
or
another
it
had
been
a
good
day
work
but
as
yet
it
had
not
caught
the
slayer
or
cleared
up
the
mystery
of
bertha
curtis
some
one
or
something
had
had
a
power
over
the
girl
to
lure
her
on
was
it
clendenin
the
place
in
street
on
inquiry
proved
to
be
really
closed
as
tight
as
a
drum
where
was
he
all
the
deaths
had
been
mysterious
were
still
mysterious
bertha
curtis
had
carried
her
secret
with
her
to
the
grave
to
which
she
had
been
borne
willingly
it
seemed
in
the
red
car
with
the
unknown
companion
and
the
goggled
chauffeur
i
found
myself
still
asking
what
possible
connection
she
could
have
with
smuggling
opium
kennedy
however
was
indulging
in
no
such
speculations
it
was
enough
for
him
that
the
scene
had
suddenly
shifted
and
in
a
most
unexpected
manner
i
found
him
voraciously
reading
practically
everything
that
was
being
printed
in
the
papers
about
the
revival
of
the
tong
war
they
say
much
about
the
war
but
little
about
the
cause
was
his
dry
comment
i
wish
i
could
make
up
my
mind
whether
it
is
due
to
the
closing
of
the
joints
by
or
the
belief
that
one
tong
is
informing
on
the
other
about
opium
smuggling
kennedy
passed
over
all
the
picturesque
features
in
the
newspapers
and
from
it
all
picked
out
the
one
point
that
was
most
important
for
the
case
which
he
was
working
to
clear
up
one
tong
used
revolvers
of
a
certain
make
the
other
of
a
different
make
the
bullet
which
had
killed
bertha
curtis
and
later
nichi
moto
was
from
a
pistol
like
that
of
the
hep
sings
the
difference
in
the
makes
of
guns
seemed
at
once
to
suggest
something
to
kennedy
and
instead
of
mixing
actively
in
the
war
of
the
highbinders
he
retired
to
his
unfailing
laboratory
leaving
me
to
pass
the
time
gathering
such
information
as
i
could
once
i
dropped
in
on
him
but
found
him
unsociably
surrounded
by
microscopes
and
a
very
sensitive
arrangement
for
taking
microphotographs
some
of
his
negatives
were
nearly
a
foot
in
diameter
and
might
have
been
for
all
i
knew
pictures
of
the
surface
of
the
moon
while
i
was
there
came
in
craig
questioned
him
about
the
war
of
the
tongs
why
cried
almost
bubbling
over
with
satisfaction
this
afternoon
i
was
waited
on
by
chin
jung
you
remember
one
of
the
leading
merchants
down
there
of
course
you
know
that
chinatown
believe
in
hurting
business
and
it
seems
that
he
and
some
of
the
others
like
him
are
afraid
that
if
the
tong
war
is
not
hushed
up
pretty
soon
it
will
cost
a
lot
in
money
they
are
going
to
have
an
anniversary
of
the
founding
of
the
chinese
republic
soon
and
of
the
chinese
new
year
and
they
are
afraid
that
if
the
war
does
stop
they
be
ruined
which
tong
does
he
belong
to
asked
kennedy
still
scrutinising
a
photograph
through
his
lens
neither
replied
with
his
aid
and
that
of
a
judge
of
one
of
our
courts
who
knows
the
chinaman
like
a
book
we
have
had
a
conference
this
afternoon
between
the
two
tongs
and
the
truce
is
restored
again
for
two
weeks
very
good
answered
kennedy
but
it
does
catch
the
murderer
of
bertha
curtis
and
the
jap
where
is
clendenin
do
you
suppose
i
do
know
but
it
at
least
leaves
me
free
to
carry
on
that
case
what
are
all
these
pictures
well
began
kennedy
taking
his
glass
from
his
eye
and
wiping
it
carefully
a
paris
crime
specialist
has
formulated
a
system
for
identifying
revolver
bullets
which
is
very
like
that
of
bertillon
for
identifying
human
beings
he
picked
up
a
handful
of
the
greatly
enlarged
photographs
these
are
photographs
of
bullets
which
he
has
sent
me
the
barrel
of
every
gun
leaves
marks
on
the
bullet
that
are
always
the
same
for
the
same
barrel
but
never
identical
for
two
different
barrels
in
these
big
negatives
every
detail
appears
very
distinctly
and
it
can
be
decided
with
absolute
certainty
whether
a
given
bullet
was
fired
from
a
given
revolver
now
using
this
same
method
i
have
made
similar
greatly
enlarged
photographs
of
the
two
bullets
that
have
figured
so
far
in
this
case
the
bullet
that
killed
miss
curtis
shows
the
same
marks
as
that
which
killed
nichi
he
picked
up
another
bunch
of
prints
now
he
continued
taking
up
the
firing
pin
of
a
rifle
or
the
hammer
of
a
revolver
you
may
not
know
it
but
they
are
different
in
every
case
even
among
the
same
makes
they
are
different
and
can
be
detected
the
cartridge
in
either
a
gun
or
revolver
is
struck
at
a
point
which
is
never
in
the
exact
centre
or
edge
as
the
case
may
be
but
is
always
the
same
for
the
same
weapon
now
the
end
of
the
hammer
when
examined
with
the
microscope
bears
certain
irregularities
of
marking
different
from
those
of
every
other
gun
and
the
shell
fired
in
it
is
impressed
with
the
particular
markings
of
that
hammer
just
as
paper
is
by
type
on
making
microphotographs
of
firing
pins
or
hammers
with
special
reference
to
the
rounded
ends
and
also
photographs
of
the
corresponding
rounded
depressions
in
the
primers
fired
by
them
it
is
forced
on
any
one
that
cartridges
fired
by
each
individual
rifle
or
pistol
can
positively
be
identified
you
will
see
on
the
edge
of
the
photographs
i
have
made
a
rough
sketch
calling
attention
to
the
mark
which
is
the
chief
characteristic
of
this
hammer
although
there
are
other
detailed
markings
which
show
well
under
the
microscope
but
not
well
in
a
photograph
you
will
notice
that
the
characters
on
the
firing
hammer
are
reversed
on
the
cartridge
in
the
same
way
that
a
metal
type
and
the
character
printed
by
it
are
reversed
as
regards
one
another
again
depressions
on
the
end
of
the
hammer
become
raised
characters
on
the
cartridge
and
raised
characters
on
the
hammer
become
depressions
on
the
cartridge
look
at
some
of
these
old
photographs
and
you
will
see
that
they
differ
from
this
they
lack
the
mark
some
have
circles
others
a
very
different
series
of
pits
and
elevations
a
set
of
characters
when
examined
and
measured
under
the
microscope
utterly
different
from
those
in
every
other
case
each
is
unique
in
its
pits
lines
circles
and
irregularities
the
laws
of
chance
are
as
much
against
two
of
them
having
the
same
markings
as
they
are
against
the
thumb
prints
of
two
human
subjects
being
identical
the
theory
which
was
used
in
a
famous
case
in
maine
is
just
as
infallible
as
the
theory
in
this
case
when
we
find
the
owner
of
the
gun
making
an
mark
we
shall
have
the
murderer
something
i
could
see
was
working
on
mind
that
all
right
he
interjected
but
you
know
in
neither
case
was
the
victim
shot
to
death
they
were
asphyxiated
i
was
coming
to
that
rejoined
craig
you
recall
the
peculiar
marking
on
the
nose
of
those
bullets
they
were
what
is
known
as
narcotic
bullets
an
invention
of
a
pittsburg
scientist
they
have
the
property
of
lulling
their
victims
to
almost
instant
slumber
a
slight
scratch
from
these
bullets
is
all
that
is
necessary
as
it
was
in
the
case
of
the
man
who
spied
on
the
queer
doings
on
staten
island
the
drug
usually
morphia
is
carried
in
tiny
wells
on
the
cap
of
the
bullet
is
absorbed
by
the
system
and
acts
almost
instantly
the
door
burst
open
and
walker
curtis
strode
in
excitedly
he
seemed
surprised
to
see
us
all
there
hesitated
then
motioned
to
kennedy
that
he
wished
to
see
him
for
a
few
moments
they
talked
and
finally
i
caught
the
remark
from
kennedy
but
curtis
i
must
do
it
it
is
the
only
way
curtis
gave
a
resigned
nod
and
kennedy
turned
to
us
gentlemen
he
said
curtis
in
going
over
the
effects
of
his
sister
has
found
a
note
from
clendenin
which
mentions
another
opium
joint
down
in
chinatown
he
wished
me
to
investigate
privately
but
i
have
told
him
it
would
be
impossible
at
the
mention
of
a
den
in
the
district
he
was
cleaning
up
had
pricked
up
his
ears
where
is
it
he
demanded
curtis
mentioned
a
number
on
dover
street
the
amoy
restaurant
ejaculated
seizing
the
telephone
a
moment
later
he
was
arranging
with
the
captain
at
the
elizabeth
street
station
for
the
warrants
for
an
instant
raid
xii
the
dope
trust
as
we
hurried
into
chinatown
from
chatham
square
we
could
see
that
the
district
was
celebrating
its
holidays
with
long
ropes
of
firecrackers
and
was
feasting
to
reed
discords
from
the
pipes
of
its
most
famous
musicians
and
was
gay
with
the
hanging
out
of
many
sunflags
red
with
an
white
sun
in
the
blue
union
both
the
new
tong
truce
and
the
anniversary
were
more
than
cause
for
rejoicing
hurried
though
it
was
the
raid
on
the
hep
sing
joint
had
been
carefully
prepared
by
the
house
we
were
after
was
one
of
the
oldest
of
the
rookeries
with
a
gaudy
restaurant
on
the
second
floor
a
curio
shop
on
the
street
level
while
in
the
basement
all
that
was
visible
was
a
view
of
a
huge
and
orderly
pile
of
tea
chests
a
moment
before
the
windows
of
the
dwellings
above
the
restaurant
had
been
full
of
people
all
had
faded
away
even
before
the
axes
began
to
swing
on
the
basement
door
which
had
the
appearance
of
a
storeroom
for
the
shop
above
the
flimsy
outside
door
went
down
quickly
but
it
was
only
a
blind
another
door
greeted
the
raiders
the
axes
swung
noisily
and
the
crowbars
tore
at
the
fortified
ice
box
door
inside
after
breaking
it
down
they
had
to
claw
their
way
through
another
just
like
it
the
thick
doors
and
tea
chests
piled
up
showed
why
no
sounds
of
gambling
and
other
practices
ever
were
heard
outside
pushing
aside
a
curtain
we
were
in
the
main
room
the
scene
was
one
of
confusion
showing
the
hasty
departure
of
the
occupants
kennedy
did
not
stop
here
within
was
still
another
room
for
smokers
anything
but
like
the
fashionable
place
we
had
seen
uptown
it
was
low
common
disgusting
the
odour
everywhere
was
offensive
everywhere
was
filth
that
should
naturally
breed
disease
it
was
an
inferno
reeking
with
unwholesome
sweat
and
still
obscured
with
dense
fumes
of
smoke
three
tiers
of
bunks
of
hardwood
were
built
along
the
walls
there
was
no
glamour
here
all
was
sordid
several
chinamen
in
various
stages
of
dazed
indolence
were
jabbering
in
incoherent
oblivion
a
state
i
suppose
of
oriental
calm
there
in
a
bunk
lay
clendenin
his
slow
and
uncertain
breathing
told
of
his
being
under
the
influence
of
the
drug
and
he
lay
on
his
back
beside
a
layout
with
a
pill
still
in
the
bowl
of
his
pipe
the
question
was
to
wake
him
up
craig
began
slapping
him
with
a
wet
towel
directing
us
how
to
keep
him
roused
we
walked
him
about
up
and
down
dazed
less
than
half
sensible
dreaming
muttering
raving
a
hasty
exclamation
from
followed
as
he
drew
from
the
scant
cushions
of
the
bunk
a
pistol
a
such
as
the
tong
leaders
used
the
same
make
as
had
shot
bertha
curtis
and
nichi
craig
seized
it
and
stuck
it
into
his
pocket
all
the
gamblers
had
fled
all
except
those
too
drugged
to
escape
where
they
had
gone
was
indicated
by
a
door
leading
up
to
the
kitchen
of
the
restaurant
craig
did
not
stop
but
leaped
upstairs
and
then
down
again
into
a
little
back
court
by
means
of
a
through
a
sort
of
short
alley
we
groped
our
way
or
rather
through
an
intricate
maze
of
alleys
and
a
labyrinth
of
blind
recesses
we
were
apparently
back
of
a
store
on
pell
street
it
was
the
work
of
only
a
moment
to
go
through
another
door
and
into
another
room
filled
with
smoky
dirty
unpleasant
fetid
air
this
room
too
seemed
to
be
piled
with
tea
chests
craig
opened
one
there
lay
piles
and
piles
of
opium
tins
a
veritable
fortune
in
the
drug
mysterious
pots
and
pans
strainers
wooden
vessels
and
testing
instruments
were
about
the
odour
of
opium
in
the
manufacture
was
unmistakable
for
smoking
opium
is
different
from
the
medicinal
drug
there
it
appeared
the
supplies
of
thousands
of
smokers
all
over
the
country
were
stored
and
prepared
in
a
corner
a
mass
of
the
finished
product
lay
weltering
in
a
basin
like
treacle
in
another
corner
was
the
apparatus
for
remaking
or
opium
this
i
felt
was
at
last
the
home
of
the
dope
trust
as
had
once
called
it
the
secret
realm
of
a
real
opium
king
the
american
end
of
the
rich
shanghai
syndicate
a
door
opened
and
there
stood
a
chinaman
stoical
secretive
indifferent
with
all
the
oriental
cunning
and
cruelty
on
his
face
yet
there
was
a
fascination
and
air
of
eastern
culture
about
him
in
spite
of
that
strange
and
typical
oriental
depth
of
intrigue
and
cunning
that
shone
through
great
characteristics
of
the
east
no
one
said
a
word
as
kennedy
continued
to
ransack
the
place
at
last
under
a
rubbish
heap
he
found
a
revolver
wrapped
up
loosely
in
an
old
sweater
quickly
under
the
bright
light
craig
drew
pistol
fitted
a
cartridge
into
it
and
fired
at
the
wall
again
into
the
second
gun
he
fitted
another
and
a
second
shot
rang
out
out
of
his
pocket
came
next
the
small
magnifying
glass
and
two
unmounted
microphotographs
he
bent
down
over
the
exploded
shells
there
it
is
cried
craig
scarcely
able
to
restrain
himself
with
the
keenness
of
his
chase
there
it
is
the
mark
like
an
this
cartridge
bears
the
one
mark
distinct
not
possible
to
have
been
made
by
any
other
pistol
in
the
world
none
of
the
hep
sings
all
with
the
same
make
of
weapons
none
of
the
gunmen
in
their
employ
could
duplicate
that
mark
some
bullets
reported
a
policeman
who
had
been
rummaging
further
in
the
rubbish
be
careful
man
cautioned
craig
they
are
doped
lay
them
down
yes
this
is
the
same
gun
that
fired
the
shot
at
bertha
curtis
and
nichi
moto
fired
narcotic
bullets
in
order
to
stop
any
one
who
interfered
with
the
opium
smuggling
without
killing
the
victim
what
the
matter
asked
arriving
breathless
from
the
gambling
room
after
hearing
the
shots
the
chinaman
stood
still
silent
impassive
at
sight
of
him
gasped
out
chin
jung
real
tong
leader
added
craig
and
the
murderer
of
the
white
girl
to
whom
he
was
engaged
this
is
the
goggled
chauffeur
of
the
red
car
that
met
the
smuggling
boat
and
in
which
bertha
curtis
rode
unsuspecting
to
her
death
and
clendenin
asked
walker
curtis
not
comprehending
a
tool
poor
wretch
so
keen
had
the
hunt
for
him
become
that
he
had
to
hide
in
the
only
safe
place
with
the
coolies
of
his
employer
he
must
have
been
in
such
abject
terror
that
he
has
almost
smoked
himself
to
death
but
why
should
the
chinaman
shoot
my
sister
asked
walker
curtis
amazed
at
the
turn
of
events
your
sister
replied
craig
almost
reverently
wrecked
though
she
was
by
the
drug
was
at
last
conscience
stricken
when
she
saw
the
vast
plot
to
debauch
thousands
of
others
it
was
from
her
that
the
japanese
detective
in
the
revenue
service
got
his
information
and
both
of
them
have
paid
the
price
but
they
have
smashed
the
new
opium
ring
we
have
captured
the
of
the
gang
out
of
the
maze
of
streets
on
chatham
square
again
we
lost
no
time
in
mounting
to
the
safety
of
the
elevated
station
before
some
murderous
tong
member
might
seek
revenge
on
us
the
celebration
in
chinatown
was
stilled
it
was
as
though
the
nerves
of
the
place
had
been
paralysed
by
our
sudden
sharp
blow
a
downtown
train
took
me
to
the
office
to
write
a
beat
for
the
star
always
made
a
special
feature
of
the
picturesque
in
chinatown
news
kennedy
went
uptown
except
for
a
few
moments
in
the
morning
i
did
not
see
kennedy
again
until
the
following
afternoon
for
the
tong
war
proved
to
be
such
an
interesting
feature
that
i
had
to
help
lay
out
and
direct
the
assignments
covering
its
various
details
i
managed
to
get
away
again
as
soon
as
possible
however
for
i
knew
that
it
would
not
be
long
before
some
one
else
in
trouble
would
commandeer
kennedy
to
untangle
a
mystery
and
i
wanted
to
be
on
the
spot
when
it
started
sure
enough
it
turned
out
that
i
was
right
seated
with
him
in
our
living
room
when
i
came
in
from
my
hasty
journey
uptown
in
the
subway
was
a
man
tall
with
a
crop
of
closely
curling
dark
hair
a
sharp
pointed
nose
ferret
eyes
and
a
reddish
moustache
curled
at
the
ends
i
had
no
difficulty
in
deciding
what
he
was
if
not
who
he
was
he
was
the
typical
detective
who
for
the
very
reason
that
he
looked
the
part
destroyed
much
of
his
own
usefulness
we
have
lost
so
much
lately
at
trimble
he
was
saying
that
it
is
long
past
the
stage
of
being
merely
interesting
it
is
downright
serious
for
me
at
least
i
got
to
make
good
or
lose
my
job
and
i
up
against
one
of
the
cleverest
shoplifters
that
ever
entered
a
apparently
only
heaven
knows
how
much
she
has
got
away
with
in
various
departments
so
far
but
when
it
comes
to
lifting
valuable
things
like
pieces
of
jewelry
which
run
into
the
thousands
that
is
too
much
at
the
mention
of
the
name
of
the
big
trimble
store
i
had
recognised
at
once
what
the
man
was
and
it
did
not
need
kennedy
introduction
of
michael
donnelly
to
tell
me
that
he
was
a
department
store
detective
have
you
no
clue
no
suspicions
inquired
kennedy
well
yes
suspicions
measured
donnelly
slowly
for
instance
one
day
not
long
ago
a
beautifully
dressed
and
woman
called
at
the
jewellery
department
and
asked
to
see
a
diamond
necklace
which
we
had
just
imported
from
paris
she
seemed
to
admire
it
very
much
studied
it
tried
it
on
but
finally
went
away
without
making
up
her
mind
a
couple
of
days
later
she
returned
and
asked
to
see
it
again
this
time
there
happened
to
be
another
woman
beside
her
who
was
looking
at
some
pendants
the
two
fell
to
talking
about
the
necklace
according
to
the
best
recollection
of
the
clerk
and
the
second
woman
began
to
examine
it
critically
again
the
prospective
buyer
went
away
but
this
time
after
she
had
gone
and
when
he
was
putting
the
things
back
into
the
safe
the
clerk
examined
the
necklace
thinking
that
perhaps
a
flaw
had
been
discovered
in
it
which
had
decided
the
woman
against
it
it
was
a
replica
in
paste
probably
substituted
by
one
of
these
clever
and
smartly
dressed
women
for
the
real
necklace
before
craig
had
a
chance
to
put
another
question
the
buzzer
on
our
door
sounded
and
i
admitted
a
dapper
man
of
middle
size
who
might
have
been
a
travelling
salesman
or
a
bookkeeper
he
pulled
a
card
from
his
case
and
stood
facing
us
evidently
in
doubt
how
to
proceed
professor
kennedy
he
asked
at
length
balancing
the
pasteboard
between
his
fingers
yes
answered
craig
what
can
i
do
for
you
i
am
from
shorham
the
fifth
avenue
jeweller
you
know
he
began
brusquely
as
he
handed
the
card
to
kennedy
i
thought
i
drop
in
to
consult
you
about
a
peculiar
thing
that
happened
at
the
store
recently
but
if
you
are
engaged
i
can
wait
you
see
we
had
on
exhibition
a
very
handsome
pearl
dogcollar
and
a
few
days
ago
two
women
came
to
say
interrupted
kennedy
glancing
from
the
card
to
the
face
of
joseph
bentley
and
then
at
donnelly
what
is
this
a
gathering
of
the
clans
there
seems
to
be
an
epidemic
of
shoplifting
how
much
were
you
stung
for
about
twenty
thousand
altogether
replied
bentley
with
rueful
frankness
why
has
some
one
else
been
victimised
too
xiii
the
kleptomaniac
quickly
kennedy
outlined
with
donnelly
permission
the
story
we
had
just
heard
the
two
store
detectives
saw
the
humour
of
the
situation
as
well
as
the
seriousness
of
it
and
fell
to
comparing
notes
the
professional
as
well
as
the
amateur
has
always
presented
to
me
an
interesting
phase
of
criminality
remarked
kennedy
tentatively
during
a
lull
in
their
mutual
commiseration
with
thousands
of
dollars
worth
of
goods
lying
unprotected
on
the
counters
it
is
really
no
wonder
that
some
are
tempted
to
reach
out
and
take
what
they
want
yes
explained
donnelly
the
is
the
greatest
unsolved
problem
why
sir
she
gets
more
plunder
in
a
year
than
the
burglar
she
costing
the
stores
over
two
million
dollars
and
she
is
at
her
busiest
just
now
with
the
season
shopping
in
full
swing
it
the
price
the
stores
have
to
pay
for
displaying
their
goods
but
we
have
to
do
it
and
we
are
at
the
mercy
of
the
thieves
i
do
mean
by
that
the
occasional
shoplifter
who
when
she
gets
caught
confesses
cries
pleads
and
begs
to
return
the
stolen
article
they
often
get
off
it
is
the
regulars
who
get
the
two
million
those
known
to
the
police
whose
pictures
are
many
of
them
in
the
gallery
whose
careers
and
haunts
are
known
to
every
probation
officer
they
are
getting
away
with
loot
that
means
for
them
a
sumptuous
living
of
course
we
are
not
up
against
the
same
sort
of
swindlers
that
you
are
put
in
bentley
but
let
me
tell
you
that
when
the
big
jewelers
do
get
up
against
anything
of
the
sort
they
are
up
against
it
hard
have
you
any
idea
who
it
could
be
asked
kennedy
who
had
been
following
the
discussion
keenly
well
some
idea
spoke
up
donnelly
from
what
bentley
says
i
would
be
surprised
to
find
that
it
was
the
same
person
in
both
cases
of
course
you
know
how
rushed
all
the
stores
are
just
now
it
is
much
easier
for
these
individuals
to
operate
during
the
rush
than
at
any
other
time
in
the
summer
for
instance
there
is
almost
no
at
all
i
thought
that
perhaps
we
could
discover
this
particular
shoplifter
by
ordinary
means
that
perhaps
some
of
the
clerks
in
the
jewellery
department
might
be
able
to
identify
her
we
found
one
who
said
that
he
thought
he
might
recognise
one
of
the
women
if
he
saw
her
again
perhaps
you
did
not
know
that
we
have
our
own
little
rogues
gallery
in
most
of
the
big
but
there
did
happen
to
be
anything
there
that
he
recognised
so
i
took
him
down
to
police
headquarters
through
plate
after
plate
of
pictures
among
the
shoplifters
in
the
regular
rogues
gallery
the
clerk
went
at
last
he
came
to
one
picture
that
caused
him
to
stop
is
one
of
the
women
i
saw
in
the
store
that
day
he
said
sure
of
it
donnelly
produced
a
copy
of
the
bertillon
picture
what
exclaimed
bentley
as
he
glanced
at
it
and
then
at
the
name
and
history
on
the
back
annie
grayson
why
she
is
known
as
the
queen
of
shoplifters
she
has
operated
from
christie
in
london
to
the
little
of
san
francisco
she
has
worked
under
a
dozen
aliases
and
has
the
art
of
alibi
down
to
perfection
oh
i
heard
of
her
many
times
before
i
wonder
if
she
really
is
the
person
we
looking
for
they
say
that
annie
grayson
has
forgotten
more
about
shoplifting
than
the
others
will
ever
know
yes
continued
donnelly
and
here
the
queer
part
of
it
the
clerk
was
ready
to
swear
that
he
had
seen
the
woman
in
the
store
at
some
time
or
other
but
whether
she
had
been
near
the
counter
where
the
necklace
was
displayed
was
another
matter
he
was
so
sure
about
that
then
how
did
she
get
it
i
asked
much
interested
i
do
say
that
she
did
get
it
cautioned
donnelly
i
do
know
anything
about
it
that
is
why
i
am
here
consulting
professor
kennedy
then
who
did
get
it
do
you
think
i
demanded
we
have
a
great
deal
of
very
conflicting
testimony
from
the
various
clerks
donnelly
continued
among
those
who
are
known
to
have
visited
the
department
and
to
have
seen
the
necklace
is
another
woman
of
an
entirely
different
character
well
known
in
the
city
he
glanced
sharply
at
us
as
if
to
impress
us
with
what
he
was
about
to
say
then
he
leaned
over
and
almost
whispered
the
name
as
nearly
as
i
can
gather
out
of
the
mass
of
evidence
william
willoughby
the
wife
of
the
broker
down
in
wall
street
was
the
last
person
who
was
seen
looking
at
the
diamonds
the
mere
breath
of
such
a
suspicion
would
have
been
enough
without
his
method
of
imparting
the
information
i
felt
that
it
was
no
wonder
that
having
even
a
suspicion
of
this
sort
he
should
be
in
doubt
how
to
go
ahead
and
should
wish
kennedy
advice
ella
willoughby
besides
being
the
wife
of
one
of
the
best
known
operators
in
stocks
and
bonds
was
well
known
in
the
society
columns
of
the
newspapers
she
lived
in
glenclair
where
she
was
a
leader
of
the
smarter
set
at
both
the
church
and
the
country
club
the
group
who
preserved
this
neat
balance
between
higher
things
and
the
world
the
flesh
and
the
devil
i
knew
to
be
a
very
exclusive
group
which
under
the
calm
suburban
surface
led
a
sufficiently
rapid
life
willoughby
in
addition
to
being
a
leader
was
a
very
striking
woman
and
a
beautiful
dresser
who
set
a
fast
pace
for
the
who
composed
the
group
here
indeed
was
a
puzzle
at
the
very
start
of
the
case
it
was
in
all
probability
willoughby
who
had
looked
at
the
jewels
in
both
cases
on
the
other
hand
it
was
annie
grayson
who
had
been
seen
on
at
least
one
occasion
yet
apparently
had
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
missing
jewels
at
least
not
so
far
as
any
tangible
evidence
yet
showed
more
than
that
donnelly
vouchsafed
the
information
that
he
had
gone
further
and
that
some
of
the
men
under
him
had
endeavoured
to
follow
the
movements
of
the
two
women
and
had
found
what
looked
to
be
a
curious
crossing
of
trails
both
of
them
he
had
found
had
been
in
the
habit
of
visiting
while
shopping
the
same
little
on
street
though
no
one
had
ever
seen
them
together
there
and
the
coincidence
might
be
accounted
for
by
the
fact
that
many
glenclair
ladies
on
shopping
expeditions
made
this
a
sort
of
rendezvous
by
inquiring
about
among
his
own
fraternity
donnelly
had
found
that
other
stores
also
had
reported
losses
recently
mostly
of
diamonds
and
pearls
both
black
and
white
kennedy
had
been
pondering
the
situation
for
some
time
scarcely
uttering
a
word
both
detectives
were
now
growing
restless
waiting
for
him
to
say
something
as
for
me
i
knew
that
if
anything
were
said
or
done
it
would
be
in
kennedy
own
good
time
i
had
learned
to
have
implicit
faith
and
confidence
in
him
for
i
doubt
if
craig
could
have
been
placed
in
a
situation
where
he
would
not
know
just
what
to
do
after
he
had
looked
over
the
ground
at
length
he
leisurely
reached
across
the
table
for
the
suburban
telephone
book
turned
the
pages
quickly
snapped
it
shut
and
observed
wearily
and
as
it
seemed
irrelevantly
the
same
old
trouble
again
about
accurate
testimony
i
doubt
whether
if
i
should
suddenly
pull
a
revolver
and
shoot
jameson
either
of
you
two
men
could
give
a
strictly
accurate
account
of
just
what
happened
no
one
said
anything
as
he
raised
his
hands
from
his
habitual
thinking
posture
with
together
placed
both
hands
back
of
his
head
and
leaned
back
facing
us
squarely
the
first
step
he
said
slowly
must
be
to
arrange
a
as
nearly
as
i
can
make
out
the
shoplifters
or
shoplifter
whichever
it
may
prove
to
be
have
no
hint
that
any
one
is
watching
them
yet
now
donnelly
it
is
still
very
early
i
want
you
to
telephone
around
to
the
newspapers
and
either
in
the
trimble
advertisements
or
in
the
news
columns
have
it
announced
that
your
jewellery
department
has
on
exhibition
a
new
and
special
importation
of
south
african
stones
among
which
is
one
let
me
see
let
call
it
the
queen
that
will
sound
attractive
in
the
meantime
find
the
largest
and
most
perfect
paste
jewel
in
town
and
have
it
fixed
up
for
exhibition
and
labelled
the
kimberley
queen
give
it
a
history
if
you
can
anything
to
attract
attention
i
see
you
in
the
morning
and
thank
you
for
coming
to
me
with
this
case
it
was
quite
late
but
kennedy
now
thoroughly
interested
in
following
the
chase
had
no
intention
of
waiting
until
the
morrow
before
taking
action
on
his
own
account
in
fact
he
was
just
beginning
the
work
by
sending
donnelly
off
to
arrange
the
plant
no
less
interested
in
the
case
than
himself
i
needed
no
second
invitation
and
in
a
few
minutes
we
were
headed
from
our
rooms
toward
the
laboratory
where
kennedy
had
apparatus
to
meet
almost
any
conceivable
emergency
from
a
shelf
in
the
corner
he
took
down
an
oblong
oak
box
perhaps
eighteen
inches
in
length
in
the
front
of
which
was
set
a
circular
metal
disk
with
a
sort
of
pointer
and
dial
he
lifted
the
lid
of
the
box
and
inside
i
could
see
two
shiny
caps
which
in
turn
he
lifted
disclosing
what
looked
like
two
spools
of
wire
apparently
satisfied
with
his
scrutiny
he
snapped
the
lid
shut
and
wrapped
up
the
box
carefully
consigning
it
to
my
care
while
he
hunted
some
copper
wire
from
long
experience
with
kennedy
i
knew
better
than
to
ask
what
he
had
in
mind
to
do
it
was
enough
to
know
that
he
had
already
in
those
few
minutes
of
apparent
dreaming
while
donnelly
and
bentley
were
fidgeting
for
words
mapped
out
a
complete
course
of
action
we
bent
our
steps
toward
the
tube
which
carried
a
few
late
travellers
to
the
railroad
terminal
where
kennedy
purchased
tickets
for
glenclair
i
noticed
that
the
conductor
on
the
suburban
train
eyed
us
rather
suspiciously
as
though
the
mere
fact
that
we
were
not
travelling
with
commutation
tickets
at
such
an
hour
constituted
an
offence
although
i
did
not
yet
know
the
precise
nature
of
our
adventure
i
remembered
with
some
misgiving
that
i
had
read
of
police
dogs
in
glenclair
which
were
uncomfortably
familiar
with
strangers
carrying
bundles
however
we
got
along
all
right
perhaps
because
the
dogs
knew
that
in
a
town
of
commuters
every
one
was
privileged
to
carry
a
bundle
if
the
willoughbys
had
been
on
a
party
line
remarked
craig
as
we
strode
up
woodridge
avenue
trying
to
look
as
if
it
was
familiar
to
us
we
might
have
arranged
this
thing
by
stratagem
as
it
is
we
shall
have
to
resort
to
another
method
and
perhaps
better
since
we
shall
have
to
take
no
one
into
our
confidence
the
avenue
was
indeed
a
fine
thoroughfare
lined
on
both
sides
with
large
and
often
imposing
mansions
surrounded
with
trees
and
shrubbery
which
served
somewhat
to
screen
them
we
came
at
last
to
the
willoughby
house
a
sizable
colonial
residence
set
up
on
a
hill
it
was
dark
except
for
one
dim
light
in
an
upper
story
in
the
shadow
of
the
hedge
craig
silently
vaulted
the
low
fence
and
slipped
up
the
terraces
as
noiselessly
as
an
indian
scarcely
crackling
a
twig
or
rustling
a
dead
leaf
on
the
ground
he
paused
as
he
came
to
a
wing
on
the
right
of
the
house
i
had
followed
more
laboriously
carrying
the
box
and
noting
that
he
was
not
looking
so
much
at
the
house
as
at
the
sky
apparently
it
did
not
take
long
to
fathom
what
he
was
after
it
was
not
a
expedition
he
was
following
the
telephone
wire
that
ran
in
from
the
street
to
the
corner
of
the
house
near
which
we
were
now
standing
a
moment
inspection
showed
him
where
the
wire
was
led
down
on
the
outside
and
entered
through
the
top
of
a
window
quickly
he
worked
though
in
a
rather
awkward
position
attaching
two
wires
carefully
to
the
telephone
wires
next
he
relieved
me
of
the
oak
box
with
its
strange
contents
and
placed
it
under
the
porch
where
it
was
completely
hidden
by
some
which
extended
down
to
the
ground
on
this
side
then
he
attached
the
new
wires
from
the
telephone
to
it
and
hid
the
connecting
wires
as
best
he
could
behind
the
swaying
runners
of
a
vine
at
last
when
he
had
finished
to
his
satisfaction
we
retraced
our
steps
to
find
that
our
only
chance
of
getting
out
of
town
that
night
was
by
trolley
that
landed
us
after
many
changes
in
our
apartment
in
new
york
thoroughly
convinced
of
the
disadvantages
of
suburban
detective
work
nevertheless
the
next
day
found
us
out
sleuthing
about
glenclair
this
time
in
a
more
pleasant
role
we
had
a
newspaper
friend
or
two
out
there
who
was
willing
to
introduce
us
about
without
asking
too
many
questions
kennedy
of
course
insisted
on
beginning
at
the
very
headquarters
of
gossip
the
country
club
we
spent
several
enjoyable
hours
about
the
town
picking
up
a
good
deal
of
miscellaneous
and
useless
information
it
was
however
as
kennedy
had
suspected
annie
grayson
had
taken
up
her
residence
in
an
artistic
little
house
on
one
of
the
best
side
streets
of
the
town
but
her
name
was
no
longer
annie
grayson
she
was
maud
emery
a
dashing
young
widow
of
some
means
living
in
a
very
quiet
but
altogether
comfortable
style
cutting
quite
a
figure
in
the
exclusive
suburban
community
a
leading
member
of
the
church
circle
an
officer
of
the
civic
league
prominent
in
the
women
club
and
popular
with
those
to
whom
the
established
order
of
things
was
so
perfect
that
the
only
new
bulwark
of
their
rights
was
an
society
in
fact
every
one
was
talking
of
the
valuable
social
acquisition
in
the
person
of
this
attractive
young
woman
who
entertained
lavishly
and
was
bracing
up
an
otherwise
drooping
season
no
one
knew
much
about
her
but
then
that
was
not
necessary
it
was
enough
to
accept
one
whose
opinions
and
actions
were
not
subversive
of
the
social
order
in
any
way
the
willoughbys
of
course
were
among
the
most
prominent
people
in
the
town
william
willoughby
was
head
of
the
firm
of
willoughby
walton
and
it
was
the
general
opinion
that
willoughby
was
the
head
of
the
firm
of
ella
william
willoughby
the
willoughbys
were
good
mixers
and
were
spoken
well
of
even
by
the
set
who
occupied
the
social
stratum
just
one
degree
below
that
in
which
they
themselves
moved
in
fact
when
willoughby
had
been
severely
injured
in
an
automobile
accident
during
the
previous
summer
glenclair
had
shown
real
solicitude
for
her
and
had
forgotten
a
good
deal
of
its
artificiality
in
genuine
human
interest
kennedy
was
impatiently
waiting
for
an
opportunity
to
recover
the
box
which
he
had
left
under
the
willoughby
porch
several
times
we
walked
past
the
house
but
it
was
not
until
nightfall
that
he
considered
it
wise
to
make
the
recovery
again
we
slipped
silently
up
the
terraces
it
was
the
work
of
only
a
moment
to
cut
the
wires
and
in
triumph
craig
bore
off
the
precious
oak
box
and
its
batteries
he
said
little
on
our
journey
back
to
the
city
but
the
moment
we
had
reached
the
laboratory
he
set
the
box
on
a
table
with
an
attachment
which
seemed
to
be
controlled
by
pedals
operated
by
the
feet
walter
he
explained
holding
what
looked
like
an
earpiece
in
his
hand
this
is
another
of
those
new
little
instruments
that
scientific
detectives
are
using
a
poet
might
write
a
clever
little
verse
telegraphone
get
you
if
you
do
watch
out
this
is
the
latest
improved
telegraphone
a
little
electromagnetic
wizard
in
a
box
which
we
detectives
are
now
using
to
take
down
and
telephone
conversations
and
other
records
it
is
based
on
an
entirely
new
principle
in
every
way
different
from
the
phonograph
it
was
discovered
by
an
inventor
several
years
ago
while
experimenting
in
telephony
there
are
no
disks
or
cylinders
of
wax
as
in
the
phonograph
but
two
large
spools
of
extremely
fine
steel
wire
the
record
is
not
made
mechanically
on
a
cylinder
but
electromagnetically
on
this
wire
small
portions
of
magnetism
are
imparted
to
fractions
of
the
steel
wire
as
it
passes
between
two
carbon
electric
magnets
each
impression
represents
a
sound
wave
there
is
no
apparent
difference
in
the
wire
no
surface
abrasion
or
other
change
yet
each
particle
of
steel
undergoes
an
electromagnetic
transformation
by
which
the
sound
is
indelibly
imprinted
on
it
until
it
is
wiped
out
by
the
erasing
magnet
there
are
no
cylinders
to
be
shaved
all
that
is
needed
to
use
the
wire
again
is
to
pass
a
magnet
over
it
automatically
erasing
any
previous
record
that
you
do
not
wish
to
preserve
you
can
dictate
into
it
or
with
this
plug
in
you
can
record
a
telephone
conversation
on
it
even
rust
or
other
deterioration
of
the
steel
wire
by
time
will
not
affect
this
electromagnetic
registry
of
sound
it
can
be
read
as
long
as
steel
will
last
it
is
as
effective
for
long
distances
as
for
short
and
there
is
wire
enough
on
one
of
these
spools
for
thirty
minutes
of
uninterrupted
record
craig
continued
to
tinker
tantalisingly
with
the
machine
the
principle
on
which
it
is
based
he
added
is
that
a
mass
of
tempered
steel
may
be
impressed
with
and
will
retain
magnetic
fluxes
varying
in
density
and
in
sign
in
adjacent
portions
of
its
mass
there
are
no
indentations
on
the
wire
or
the
steel
disk
instead
there
is
a
deposit
of
magnetic
impulse
on
the
wire
which
is
made
by
connecting
up
an
ordinary
telephone
transmitter
with
the
electromagnets
and
talking
through
the
coil
the
disturbance
set
up
in
the
coils
by
the
vibration
of
the
diaphragm
of
the
transmitter
causes
a
deposit
of
magnetic
impulse
on
the
wire
the
coils
being
connected
with
dry
batteries
when
the
wire
is
again
run
past
these
coils
with
a
receiver
such
as
i
have
here
in
circuit
with
the
coils
a
light
vibration
is
set
up
in
the
receiver
diaphragm
which
reproduces
the
sound
of
speech
he
turned
a
switch
and
placed
an
over
his
head
giving
me
another
connected
with
it
we
listened
eagerly
there
were
no
foreign
noises
in
the
machine
no
grating
or
thumping
sounds
as
he
controlled
the
running
off
of
the
steel
wire
by
means
of
a
we
were
listening
to
everything
that
had
been
said
over
the
willoughby
telephone
during
the
day
several
local
calls
to
tradesmen
came
first
and
these
we
passed
over
quickly
finally
we
heard
the
following
conversation
hello
is
that
you
ella
yes
this
is
maud
how
do
you
feel
maud
i
do
feel
very
well
i
have
a
splitting
headache
oh
that
too
bad
dear
what
are
you
doing
for
it
nothing
yet
if
it
does
get
better
i
shall
have
willoughby
call
up
dr
guthrie
oh
i
hope
it
gets
better
soon
you
poor
creature
do
you
think
a
little
trip
into
town
might
make
you
feel
better
had
you
thought
of
going
why
no
i
had
thought
of
going
in
are
you
going
did
you
see
the
trimble
ad
in
the
morning
paper
no
i
did
see
the
papers
this
morning
my
head
felt
too
bad
well
just
glance
at
it
it
will
interest
you
they
have
the
kimberley
queen
the
great
new
south
african
diamond
on
exhibition
there
they
have
i
never
heard
of
it
before
but
is
that
interesting
i
certainly
would
like
to
see
it
have
you
ever
seen
it
no
but
i
have
made
up
my
mind
not
to
miss
a
sight
of
it
they
say
it
is
wonderful
you
better
come
along
i
may
have
something
interesting
to
tell
you
too
well
i
believe
i
will
go
thank
you
maud
for
suggesting
it
perhaps
the
little
change
will
make
me
feel
better
what
train
are
you
going
to
take
the
all
right
i
try
to
meet
you
at
the
station
maud
ella
craig
stopped
the
machine
ran
it
back
again
and
repeated
the
record
so
he
commented
at
the
conclusion
of
the
repetition
the
has
taken
root
annie
grayson
has
bitten
at
the
bait
a
few
other
local
calls
and
a
call
from
willoughby
cut
short
by
his
not
finding
his
wife
at
home
followed
then
there
seemed
to
have
been
nothing
more
until
after
dinner
it
was
a
call
by
willoughby
himself
that
now
interested
us
hello
hello
is
that
you
guthrie
well
doctor
this
is
willoughby
talking
i
like
to
make
an
appointment
for
my
wife
why
what
the
trouble
willoughby
nothing
serious
i
hope
oh
no
i
guess
not
but
then
i
want
to
be
sure
and
i
guess
you
can
fix
her
up
all
right
she
complains
of
not
being
able
to
sleep
and
has
been
having
pretty
bad
headaches
now
and
then
is
that
so
well
that
too
bad
these
women
and
their
headaches
even
as
a
doctor
they
puzzle
me
they
often
go
away
as
suddenly
as
they
come
however
it
will
do
no
harm
to
see
me
and
then
she
complains
of
noises
in
her
ears
seems
to
hear
things
though
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
there
is
nothing
at
least
nothing
that
i
hear
hallucinations
in
hearing
i
suppose
any
dizziness
why
yes
a
little
once
in
a
while
how
is
she
now
well
she
been
into
town
this
afternoon
and
is
pretty
tired
but
she
says
she
feels
a
little
better
for
the
excitement
of
the
trip
well
let
me
see
i
got
to
come
down
woodridge
avenue
to
see
a
patient
in
a
few
minutes
anyhow
suppose
i
just
drop
off
at
your
place
that
will
be
fine
you
do
think
it
is
anything
serious
do
you
doctor
oh
no
probably
it
her
nerves
perhaps
a
little
rest
would
do
her
good
we
see
the
telegraphone
stopped
and
that
seemed
to
be
the
last
conversation
recorded
so
far
we
had
learned
nothing
very
startling
i
thought
and
was
just
a
little
disappointed
kennedy
seemed
well
satisfied
however
our
own
telephone
rang
and
it
proved
to
be
donnelly
on
the
wire
he
had
been
trying
to
get
kennedy
all
day
in
order
to
report
that
at
various
times
his
men
at
trimble
had
observed
willoughby
and
later
annie
grayson
looking
with
much
interest
at
the
kimberley
queen
and
other
jewels
in
the
exhibit
there
was
nothing
more
to
report
keep
it
on
view
another
day
or
two
ordered
kennedy
advertise
it
but
in
a
quiet
way
we
do
want
too
many
people
interested
i
see
you
in
the
morning
at
the
store
early
i
think
i
just
run
back
to
glenclair
again
remarked
kennedy
as
he
hung
up
the
receiver
you
need
bother
about
coming
walter
i
want
to
see
guthrie
a
moment
you
remember
him
we
met
him
at
the
country
club
a
kindly
looking
fellow
i
would
willingly
have
gone
back
with
him
but
i
felt
that
i
could
be
of
no
particular
use
while
he
was
gone
i
pondered
a
good
deal
over
the
situation
twice
at
least
previously
some
one
had
pilfered
jewellery
from
stores
leaving
in
its
place
worthless
imitations
twice
the
evidence
had
been
so
conflicting
that
no
one
could
judge
of
its
value
what
reason
i
asked
myself
was
there
to
suppose
that
it
would
be
different
now
no
shoplifter
in
her
senses
was
likely
to
lift
the
great
kimberley
queen
gem
with
the
eagle
eyes
of
clerks
and
detectives
on
her
even
if
she
did
not
discover
that
it
was
only
a
paste
jewel
and
if
craig
gave
the
woman
whoever
she
was
a
good
opportunity
to
get
away
with
it
it
would
be
a
case
of
the
same
conflicting
evidence
or
worse
no
evidence
yet
the
more
i
thought
of
it
the
more
apparent
to
me
was
it
that
kennedy
must
have
thought
the
whole
thing
out
before
so
far
all
that
had
been
evident
was
that
he
was
merely
preparing
a
plant
still
i
meant
to
caution
him
when
he
returned
that
one
could
not
believe
his
eyes
certainly
not
his
ears
as
to
what
might
happen
unless
he
was
unusually
skilful
or
lucky
it
would
not
do
to
rely
on
anything
so
fallible
as
the
human
eye
or
ear
and
i
meant
to
impress
it
on
him
what
after
all
had
been
the
net
result
of
our
activities
so
far
we
had
found
next
to
nothing
indeed
it
was
all
a
greater
mystery
than
ever
it
was
very
late
when
craig
returned
but
i
gathered
from
the
still
fresh
look
on
his
face
that
he
had
been
successful
in
whatever
it
was
he
had
had
in
mind
when
he
made
the
trip
i
saw
guthrie
he
reported
laconically
as
we
prepared
to
turn
in
he
says
that
he
is
quite
sure
but
that
willoughby
may
have
a
touch
of
vertigo
at
any
rate
he
has
consented
to
let
me
come
out
with
him
and
visit
her
as
a
specialist
in
nervous
diseases
from
new
york
i
had
to
tell
him
just
enough
about
the
case
to
get
him
interested
but
that
will
do
no
harm
i
think
i
set
this
alarm
an
hour
ahead
i
want
to
get
up
early
and
if
i
should
be
here
when
you
wake
you
find
me
at
trimble
xiv
the
crimeometer
the
alarm
wakened
me
all
right
but
to
my
surprise
kennedy
had
already
gone
ahead
of
it
i
dressed
hurriedly
bolted
an
early
breakfast
and
made
my
way
to
trimble
he
was
not
there
and
i
had
about
concluded
to
try
the
laboratory
when
i
saw
him
pulling
up
in
a
cab
from
which
he
took
several
packages
donnelly
had
joined
us
by
this
time
and
together
we
rode
up
in
the
elevator
to
the
jewelry
department
i
had
never
seen
a
when
it
was
empty
but
i
think
i
should
like
to
shop
in
one
under
those
conditions
it
seemed
incredible
to
get
into
the
elevator
and
go
directly
to
the
floor
you
wanted
the
jewelry
department
was
in
the
front
of
the
building
on
one
of
the
upper
floors
with
wide
windows
through
which
the
bright
morning
light
streamed
attractively
on
the
glittering
wares
that
the
clerks
were
taking
out
of
the
safes
and
disposing
to
their
best
advantage
the
store
had
not
opened
yet
and
we
could
work
unhampered
from
his
packages
kennedy
took
three
black
boxes
they
seemed
to
have
an
opening
in
front
while
at
one
side
was
a
little
crank
which
as
nearly
as
i
could
make
out
was
operated
by
clockwork
released
by
an
electric
contact
his
first
problem
seemed
to
be
to
dispose
the
boxes
to
the
best
advantage
at
various
angles
about
the
counter
where
the
kimberley
queen
was
on
exhibition
with
so
much
and
other
large
articles
about
it
did
not
appear
to
be
very
difficult
to
conceal
the
boxes
which
were
perhaps
four
inches
square
on
the
ends
and
eight
inches
deep
from
the
boxes
with
the
clockwork
attachment
at
the
side
he
led
wires
centring
at
a
point
at
the
interior
end
of
the
aisle
where
we
could
see
but
would
hardly
be
observed
by
any
one
standing
at
the
jewelry
counter
customers
had
now
begun
to
arrive
and
we
took
a
position
in
the
background
prepared
for
a
long
wait
now
and
then
donnelly
casually
sauntered
past
us
he
and
craig
had
disposed
the
store
detectives
in
a
certain
way
so
as
to
make
their
presence
less
obvious
while
the
clerks
had
received
instructions
how
to
act
under
the
circumstance
that
a
suspicious
person
was
observed
once
when
donnelly
came
up
he
was
quite
excited
he
had
just
received
a
message
from
bentley
that
some
of
the
stolen
property
the
pearls
probably
from
the
dog
collar
that
had
been
taken
from
shorham
had
been
offered
for
sale
by
a
fence
known
to
the
police
as
a
former
confederate
of
annie
grayson
you
see
that
is
one
great
trouble
with
them
all
he
remarked
with
his
eye
roving
about
the
store
in
search
of
anything
irregular
a
shoplifter
rarely
becomes
a
habitual
criminal
until
after
she
passes
the
age
of
if
they
pass
that
age
without
quitting
there
is
little
hope
of
their
getting
right
again
as
you
see
for
by
that
time
they
have
long
since
begun
to
consort
with
thieves
of
the
other
sex
the
hours
dragged
heavily
though
it
was
a
splendid
chance
to
observe
at
leisure
the
psychology
of
the
shopper
who
looked
at
much
and
bought
little
the
uncomfortableness
of
the
men
who
had
been
dragged
to
the
department
store
slaughter
to
say
yes
and
foot
the
bills
a
kaleidoscopic
throng
which
might
have
been
interesting
if
we
had
not
been
so
intent
on
only
one
matter
kennedy
grasped
my
elbow
in
fingers
involuntarily
i
looked
down
at
the
counter
where
the
kimberley
queen
reposed
in
all
the
trappings
of
genuineness
willoughby
had
arrived
again
we
were
too
far
off
to
observe
distinctly
just
what
was
taking
place
but
evidently
willoughby
was
looking
at
the
gem
a
moment
later
another
woman
sauntered
casually
up
to
the
counter
even
at
a
distance
i
recognised
annie
grayson
as
nearly
as
i
could
make
out
they
seemed
to
exchange
remarks
the
clerk
answered
a
question
or
two
then
began
to
search
for
something
apparently
to
show
them
every
one
about
them
was
busy
and
obedient
to
instructions
from
donnelly
the
store
detectives
were
in
the
background
kennedy
was
leaning
forward
watching
as
intently
as
the
distance
would
permit
he
reached
over
and
pressed
the
button
near
him
after
a
minute
or
two
the
second
woman
left
followed
shortly
by
willoughby
herself
we
hurried
over
to
the
counter
and
kennedy
seized
the
box
containing
the
kimberley
queen
he
examined
it
carefully
a
flaw
in
the
paste
jewel
caught
his
eye
there
has
been
a
substitution
here
he
cried
see
the
paste
jewel
which
we
used
was
flawless
this
has
a
little
carbon
spot
here
on
the
side
one
of
my
men
has
been
detailed
to
follow
each
of
them
whispered
donnelly
shall
i
order
them
to
bring
willoughby
and
annie
grayson
to
the
superintendent
office
and
have
them
searched
no
craig
almost
shouted
that
would
spoil
everything
do
make
a
move
until
i
get
at
the
real
truth
of
this
affair
the
case
was
becoming
more
than
ever
a
puzzle
to
me
but
there
was
nothing
left
for
me
to
do
but
to
wait
until
kennedy
was
ready
to
accompany
guthrie
to
the
willoughby
house
several
times
he
tried
to
reach
the
doctor
by
telephone
but
it
was
not
until
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
that
he
succeeded
i
shall
be
quite
busy
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
walter
remarked
craig
after
he
had
made
his
appointment
with
guthrie
if
you
will
meet
me
out
at
the
willoughbys
at
about
eight
i
shall
be
much
obliged
to
you
i
promised
and
tried
to
devote
myself
to
catching
up
with
my
notes
which
were
always
sadly
behind
when
kennedy
had
an
important
case
i
did
not
succeed
in
accomplishing
much
however
guthrie
himself
met
me
at
the
door
of
the
beautiful
house
on
woodridge
avenue
and
with
a
hearty
handshake
ushered
me
into
the
large
room
in
the
right
wing
outside
of
which
we
had
placed
the
telegraphone
two
nights
before
it
was
the
library
we
found
kennedy
arranging
an
instrument
in
the
which
adjoined
the
library
from
what
little
knowledge
i
have
of
electricity
i
should
have
said
it
was
in
part
at
least
a
galvanometer
one
of
those
instruments
which
register
the
intensity
of
minute
electric
currents
as
nearly
as
i
could
make
out
in
this
case
the
galvanometer
was
so
arranged
that
its
action
swung
to
one
side
or
the
other
a
little
concave
mirror
hung
from
a
framework
which
rested
on
the
table
directly
in
front
of
it
was
an
electric
light
and
the
reflection
of
the
light
was
caught
in
the
mirror
and
focused
by
its
concavity
upon
a
point
to
one
side
of
the
light
back
of
it
was
a
long
strip
of
ground
glass
and
an
arrow
point
attached
to
which
was
a
pen
which
touched
a
roll
of
paper
on
the
large
table
in
the
library
itself
kennedy
had
placed
in
the
centre
a
transverse
board
partition
high
enough
so
that
two
people
seated
could
see
each
other
faces
and
converse
over
it
but
could
not
see
each
other
hands
on
one
side
of
the
partition
were
two
metal
domes
which
were
fixed
to
a
board
set
on
the
table
on
the
other
side
in
addition
to
space
on
which
he
could
write
kennedy
had
arranged
what
looked
like
one
of
these
new
miniature
apparatuses
operated
by
electricity
indeed
i
felt
that
it
must
be
that
for
directly
in
front
of
it
hanging
on
the
wall
in
plain
view
of
any
one
seated
on
the
side
of
the
table
containing
the
metal
domes
was
a
large
white
sheet
the
time
for
the
experiment
whatever
its
nature
might
be
had
at
last
arrived
and
guthrie
introduced
and
willoughby
to
us
as
specialists
whom
he
had
persuaded
with
great
difficulty
to
come
down
from
new
york
willoughby
he
requested
to
remain
outside
until
after
the
tests
she
seemed
perfectly
calm
as
she
greeted
us
and
looked
with
curiosity
at
the
paraphernalia
which
kennedy
had
installed
in
her
library
kennedy
who
was
putting
some
finishing
touches
on
it
was
talking
in
a
low
voice
to
reassure
her
if
you
will
sit
here
please
willoughby
and
place
your
hands
on
these
two
brass
domes
there
that
it
this
is
just
a
little
arrangement
to
test
your
nervous
condition
guthrie
who
understands
it
will
take
his
position
outside
in
the
at
that
other
table
walter
just
switch
off
that
light
please
willoughby
i
may
say
that
in
testing
say
the
memory
we
psychologists
have
recently
developed
two
tests
the
event
test
where
something
is
made
to
happen
before
a
person
eyes
and
later
he
is
asked
to
describe
it
and
the
picture
test
where
a
picture
is
shown
for
a
certain
length
of
time
after
which
the
patient
is
also
asked
to
describe
what
was
in
the
picture
i
have
endeavoured
to
combine
these
two
ideas
by
using
the
machine
which
you
see
here
i
am
going
to
show
three
reels
of
films
as
nearly
as
i
could
make
out
kennedy
had
turned
on
the
light
in
the
lantern
on
his
side
of
the
table
as
he
worked
over
the
machine
which
for
the
present
served
to
distract
willoughby
attention
from
herself
he
was
asking
her
a
series
of
questions
from
my
position
i
could
see
that
by
the
light
of
the
machine
he
was
recording
both
the
questions
and
the
answers
as
well
as
the
time
registered
to
the
fifth
of
a
second
by
a
willoughby
could
not
see
what
he
was
doing
under
the
pretence
of
working
over
his
little
machine
he
had
at
last
finished
the
questioning
suddenly
without
any
warning
a
picture
began
to
play
on
the
sheet
i
must
say
that
i
was
startled
myself
it
represented
the
jewelry
counter
at
trimble
and
in
it
i
could
see
willoughby
herself
in
animated
conversation
with
one
of
the
clerks
i
looked
intently
dividing
my
attention
between
the
picture
and
the
woman
but
so
far
as
i
could
see
there
was
nothing
in
this
first
film
that
incriminated
either
of
them
kennedy
started
on
the
second
without
stopping
it
was
practically
the
same
as
the
first
only
taken
from
a
different
angle
he
had
scarcely
run
it
half
through
when
guthrie
opened
the
door
i
think
willoughby
must
have
taken
her
hands
off
the
metal
domes
he
remarked
i
can
get
no
record
out
here
i
had
turned
when
he
opened
the
door
and
now
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
willoughby
standing
her
hands
pressed
tightly
to
her
head
as
if
it
were
bursting
and
swaying
as
if
she
would
faint
i
do
not
know
what
the
film
was
showing
at
this
point
for
kennedy
with
a
quick
movement
shut
it
off
and
sprang
to
her
side
there
that
will
do
willoughby
i
see
that
you
are
not
well
he
soothed
doctor
a
little
something
to
quiet
her
nerves
i
think
we
can
complete
our
work
merely
by
comparing
notes
call
willoughby
walter
there
sir
if
you
will
take
charge
of
your
wife
and
perhaps
take
her
for
a
turn
or
two
in
the
fresh
air
i
think
we
can
tell
you
in
a
few
moments
whether
her
condition
is
in
any
way
serious
or
not
willoughby
was
on
the
verge
of
hysterics
as
her
husband
supported
her
out
of
the
room
the
door
had
scarcely
shut
before
kennedy
threw
open
a
window
and
seemed
to
beckon
into
the
darkness
as
if
from
nowhere
donnelly
and
bentley
sprang
no
and
were
admitted
guthrie
had
now
returned
from
the
bearing
a
sheet
of
paper
on
which
was
traced
a
long
irregular
curve
at
various
points
on
which
marginal
notes
had
been
written
hastily
kennedy
leaped
directly
into
the
middle
of
things
with
his
characteristic
ardour
you
recall
he
began
that
no
one
seemed
to
know
just
who
took
the
jewels
in
both
the
cases
you
first
reported
is
believing
is
an
old
saying
but
in
the
face
of
such
reports
as
you
detectives
gathered
it
is
in
a
fair
way
to
lose
its
force
and
you
were
not
at
fault
either
for
modern
psychology
is
proving
by
experiments
that
people
do
not
see
even
a
fraction
of
the
things
they
confidently
believe
they
see
for
example
a
friend
of
mine
a
professor
in
a
western
university
has
carried
on
experiments
with
scores
of
people
and
has
not
found
one
who
could
give
a
completely
accurate
description
of
what
he
had
seen
even
in
the
direct
testimony
while
under
the
influence
of
questions
particularly
if
they
were
at
all
leading
witnesses
all
showed
extensive
inaccuracies
in
one
or
more
particulars
and
that
even
though
they
are
in
a
more
advantageous
position
for
giving
reports
than
were
your
clerks
who
were
not
prepared
indeed
it
is
often
a
wonder
to
me
that
witnesses
of
ordinary
events
who
are
called
upon
in
court
to
relate
what
they
saw
after
a
considerable
lapse
of
time
are
as
accurate
as
they
are
considering
the
questioning
they
often
go
through
from
interested
parties
neighbours
and
friends
and
the
constant
and
often
biased
rehearsing
of
the
event
the
court
asks
the
witness
to
tell
the
truth
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
how
can
he
in
fact
i
am
often
surprised
that
there
is
such
a
resemblance
between
the
testimony
and
the
actual
facts
of
the
case
but
i
have
here
a
little
witness
that
never
lies
and
mindful
of
the
fallibility
of
ordinary
witnesses
i
called
it
in
it
is
a
new
compact
little
motion
camera
which
has
just
been
perfected
to
do
automatically
what
the
big
making
cameras
do
he
touched
one
of
the
little
black
boxes
such
as
we
had
seen
him
install
in
the
jewelry
department
at
trimble
each
of
these
holds
one
hundred
and
sixty
feet
of
film
he
resumed
enough
to
last
three
minutes
taking
say
sixteen
pictures
to
the
foot
and
running
about
one
foot
a
second
you
know
that
less
than
ten
or
eleven
pictures
a
second
affect
the
retina
as
separate
broken
pictures
the
use
of
this
compact
little
motion
camera
was
suggested
to
me
by
an
ingenious
but
cumbersome
invention
recently
offered
to
the
police
in
paris
the
installation
on
the
in
various
streets
of
cinematograph
apparatus
directed
by
wireless
the
motion
camera
as
a
detective
has
now
proved
its
value
i
have
here
three
films
taken
at
trimble
from
different
angles
and
they
clearly
show
exactly
what
actually
occurred
while
willoughby
and
annie
grayson
were
looking
at
the
kimberley
queen
he
paused
as
if
analysing
the
steps
in
his
own
mind
the
telegraphone
gave
me
the
first
hint
of
the
truth
he
said
the
motion
camera
brought
me
a
step
nearer
but
without
this
third
instrument
while
i
should
have
been
successful
i
would
not
have
got
at
the
whole
truth
he
was
fingering
the
apparatus
on
the
library
table
connected
with
that
in
the
this
is
the
psychometer
for
testing
mental
aberrations
he
explained
the
scientists
who
are
using
it
are
working
not
with
a
view
to
aiding
criminal
jurisprudence
but
with
the
hope
of
making
such
discoveries
that
the
mental
health
of
the
race
may
be
bettered
still
i
believe
that
in
the
study
of
mental
diseases
these
men
are
furnishing
the
knowledge
upon
which
future
criminologists
will
build
to
make
the
detection
of
crime
an
absolute
certainty
some
day
there
will
be
no
jury
no
detectives
no
witnesses
no
attorneys
the
state
will
merely
submit
all
suspects
to
tests
of
scientific
instruments
like
these
and
as
these
instruments
can
not
make
mistakes
or
tell
lies
their
evidence
will
be
conclusive
of
guilt
or
innocence
already
the
psychometer
is
an
actual
working
fact
no
living
man
can
conceal
his
emotions
from
the
uncanny
instrument
he
may
bring
the
most
gigantic
of
into
play
to
conceal
his
inner
feelings
and
the
psychometer
will
record
the
very
work
which
he
makes
this
do
the
machine
is
based
upon
the
fact
that
experiments
have
proved
that
the
human
body
resistance
to
an
electrical
current
is
increased
with
the
increase
of
the
emotions
jung
of
zurich
thought
that
it
would
be
a
very
simple
matter
to
record
these
varying
emotions
and
the
psychometer
is
the
result
simple
and
crude
compared
with
what
we
have
a
right
to
expect
in
the
future
a
galvanometer
is
so
arranged
that
its
action
swings
a
mirror
from
side
to
side
reflecting
a
light
this
light
falls
on
a
scale
marked
off
into
centimetres
and
the
arrow
is
made
to
follow
the
beam
of
light
a
pen
pressing
down
on
a
metal
drum
carrying
a
long
roll
of
paper
revolved
by
machinery
records
the
variations
guthrie
who
had
charge
of
the
recording
simply
sat
in
front
of
the
ground
glass
and
with
the
arrow
point
followed
the
reflection
of
the
light
as
it
moved
along
the
scale
in
this
way
making
a
record
on
the
paper
on
the
drum
which
i
see
he
is
now
holding
in
his
hand
willoughby
the
subject
and
myself
the
examiner
sat
here
facing
each
other
over
this
table
through
those
metal
domes
on
which
she
was
to
keep
her
hands
she
received
an
electric
current
so
weak
that
it
could
not
be
felt
even
by
the
most
sensitive
nerves
now
with
every
increase
in
her
emotion
either
while
i
was
putting
questions
to
her
or
showing
her
the
pictures
whether
she
showed
it
outwardly
or
not
she
increased
her
body
resistance
to
the
current
that
was
being
passed
in
through
her
hands
the
increase
was
felt
by
the
galvanometer
connected
by
wires
in
the
the
mirror
swung
the
light
travelled
on
the
scale
the
arrow
was
moved
by
guthrie
and
her
varying
emotions
were
recorded
indelibly
upon
the
revolving
sheet
of
paper
recorded
in
such
a
way
as
to
show
their
intensity
and
reveal
to
the
trained
scientist
much
of
the
mental
condition
of
the
subject
kennedy
and
guthrie
now
conversed
in
low
tones
once
in
a
while
i
could
catch
a
scrap
of
the
conversation
not
an
epileptic
no
abnormal
conformation
of
the
head
certain
mental
defects
often
the
result
of
sickness
or
accident
every
time
that
woman
appeared
there
was
a
most
peculiar
disturbance
remarked
guthrie
as
kennedy
took
the
roll
of
paper
from
him
and
studied
it
carefully
at
length
the
light
seemed
to
break
through
his
face
among
the
various
kinds
of
insanity
he
said
slowly
measuring
his
words
there
is
one
that
manifests
itself
as
an
irresistible
impulse
to
steal
such
terms
as
neuropath
and
kleptomaniac
are
often
regarded
as
rather
elegant
names
for
contemptible
excuses
invented
by
medical
men
to
cover
up
stealing
people
are
prone
to
say
cynically
man
sins
rich
man
diseases
yet
kleptomania
does
exist
and
it
is
easy
to
make
it
seem
like
crime
when
it
is
really
persistent
incorrigible
and
irrational
stealing
often
it
is
so
great
as
to
be
incurable
cases
have
been
recorded
of
clergymen
who
were
kleptomaniacs
and
in
one
instance
a
dying
victim
stole
the
snuffbox
of
his
confessor
it
is
the
pleasure
and
excitement
of
stealing
not
the
desire
for
the
object
stolen
which
distinguishes
the
kleptomaniac
from
the
ordinary
thief
usually
the
kleptomaniac
is
a
woman
with
an
insane
desire
to
steal
for
the
mere
sake
of
stealing
the
morbid
craving
for
excitement
which
is
at
the
bottom
of
so
many
motiveless
and
useless
crimes
again
and
again
has
driven
apparently
sensible
men
and
women
to
ruin
and
even
to
suicide
it
is
a
form
of
emotional
insanity
not
loss
of
control
of
the
will
but
perversion
of
the
will
some
are
models
in
their
lucid
intervals
but
when
the
mania
is
on
them
they
can
not
resist
the
very
act
of
taking
constitutes
the
pleasure
not
possession
one
must
take
into
consideration
many
things
for
such
diseases
as
kleptomania
belong
exclusively
to
civilisation
they
are
the
product
of
an
age
of
sensationalism
naturally
enough
woman
with
her
delicately
balanced
nervous
organisation
is
the
first
and
chief
offender
kennedy
had
seated
himself
at
the
table
and
was
writing
hastily
when
he
had
finished
he
held
the
papers
in
his
hand
to
dry
he
handed
one
sheet
each
to
bentley
and
donnelly
we
crowded
about
kennedy
had
simply
written
out
two
bills
for
the
necklace
and
the
collar
of
pearls
send
them
in
to
willoughby
he
added
i
think
he
will
be
glad
to
pay
them
to
hush
up
the
scandal
we
looked
at
each
other
in
amazement
at
the
revelation
but
what
about
annie
grayson
persisted
donnelly
i
have
taken
care
of
her
responded
kennedy
laconically
she
is
already
under
arrest
would
you
like
to
see
why
a
moment
later
we
had
all
piled
into
guthrie
car
standing
at
the
door
at
the
cosy
little
grayson
villa
we
found
two
large
eyed
detectives
and
a
very
angry
woman
waiting
impatiently
heaped
up
on
a
table
in
the
living
room
was
a
store
of
loot
that
readily
accounted
for
the
ocular
peculiarity
of
the
detectives
the
jumble
on
the
table
contained
a
most
magnificent
collection
of
diamonds
sapphires
ropes
of
pearls
emeralds
statuettes
and
bronze
and
ivory
antiques
books
in
rare
bindings
and
other
baubles
which
wealth
alone
can
command
it
dazzled
our
eyes
as
we
made
a
mental
inventory
of
the
heap
yet
it
was
a
most
miscellaneous
collection
beside
a
pearl
collar
with
a
diamond
clasp
were
a
pair
of
plain
leather
slippers
and
a
pair
of
silk
stockings
things
of
value
and
things
of
no
value
were
mixed
as
if
by
a
lunatic
a
beautiful
neck
ornament
of
carved
coral
lay
near
a
common
linen
handkerchiefs
a
strip
of
silk
hid
a
valuable
collection
of
antique
jewellery
besides
diamonds
and
precious
stones
by
the
score
were
gold
and
silver
ornaments
silks
satins
laces
draperies
articles
of
virtu
plumes
even
cutlery
and
all
this
must
have
been
the
result
of
countless
excursions
to
the
stores
of
new
york
and
innumerable
clever
thefts
we
could
only
look
at
each
other
in
amazement
and
wonder
at
the
defiance
written
on
the
face
of
annie
grayson
in
all
this
strange
tangle
of
events
remarked
kennedy
surveying
the
pile
with
obvious
satisfaction
i
find
that
the
precise
instruments
of
science
have
told
me
one
more
thing
some
one
else
discovered
willoughby
weakness
led
her
on
suggested
opportunities
to
her
used
her
again
and
again
profited
by
her
malady
probably
to
the
extent
of
thousands
of
dollars
my
telegraphone
record
hinted
at
that
in
some
way
annie
grayson
secured
the
confidence
of
willoughby
the
one
took
for
the
sake
of
taking
the
other
received
for
the
sake
of
money
willoughby
was
easily
persuaded
by
her
new
friend
to
leave
here
what
she
had
stolen
besides
having
taken
it
she
had
no
further
interest
in
it
the
rule
of
law
is
that
every
one
is
responsible
who
knows
the
nature
and
consequences
of
his
act
we
have
absolute
proof
that
you
annie
grayson
although
you
did
not
actually
commit
any
of
the
thefts
yourself
led
willoughby
on
and
profited
by
her
guthrie
will
take
care
of
the
case
of
willoughby
but
the
law
must
deal
with
you
for
playing
on
the
insanity
of
a
kleptomaniac
the
cleverest
scheme
yet
of
the
queen
of
shoplifters
as
kennedy
turned
nonchalantly
from
the
detectives
who
had
seized
annie
grayson
he
drew
a
little
red
folder
from
his
pocket
you
see
walter
he
smiled
how
soon
one
gets
into
a
habit
almost
a
regular
commuter
now
you
know
they
are
always
bringing
out
these
little
red
folders
just
when
things
grow
interesting
i
glanced
over
his
shoulder
he
was
studying
the
local
timetable
we
can
get
the
last
train
from
glenclair
if
we
hurry
he
announced
stuffing
the
folder
back
into
his
pocket
they
will
take
her
to
newark
by
trolley
i
suppose
come
on
we
made
our
hasty
adieux
and
escaped
as
best
we
could
the
shower
of
congratulations
now
for
a
rest
he
said
settling
back
into
the
plush
covered
seat
for
the
long
ride
into
town
his
hat
down
over
his
eyes
and
his
legs
hunched
up
against
the
back
of
the
next
seat
across
in
the
tube
and
uptown
in
a
nighthawk
cab
we
went
and
at
last
we
were
home
for
a
good
sleep
this
promises
to
be
an
craig
remarked
the
next
morning
over
the
breakfast
table
meet
me
in
the
forenoon
and
we
take
a
long
swinging
walk
i
feel
the
need
of
physical
exercise
a
mark
of
returning
sanity
i
exclaimed
i
had
become
so
used
to
being
called
out
on
the
unexpected
now
that
i
almost
felt
that
some
one
might
stop
us
on
our
tramp
nothing
of
the
sort
happened
however
until
our
return
then
a
man
and
a
young
girl
heavily
veiled
were
waiting
for
kennedy
as
we
turned
in
from
the
brisk
finish
in
the
cutting
river
wind
along
the
drive
winslow
is
my
name
sir
the
man
began
rising
nervously
as
we
entered
the
room
and
this
is
my
only
daughter
ruth
kennedy
bowed
and
we
waited
for
the
man
to
proceed
he
drew
his
hand
over
his
forehead
which
was
moist
with
perspiration
in
spite
of
the
season
ruth
winslow
was
an
attractive
young
woman
i
could
see
at
a
glance
although
her
face
was
almost
completely
hidden
by
the
thick
veil
perhaps
ruth
i
had
better
ah
see
these
gentlemen
alone
suggested
her
father
gently
no
father
she
answered
in
a
tone
of
forced
bravery
i
think
not
i
can
stand
it
i
must
stand
it
perhaps
i
can
help
you
in
telling
about
the
the
case
winslow
cleared
his
throat
we
are
from
goodyear
a
little
he
proceeded
slowly
and
as
you
doubtless
can
see
we
have
just
arrived
after
travelling
all
day
goodyear
repeated
kennedy
slowly
as
the
man
paused
the
chief
industry
of
course
is
rubber
i
suppose
yes
assented
winslow
the
town
centres
about
rubber
our
factories
are
not
the
largest
but
are
very
large
nevertheless
and
are
all
that
keep
the
town
going
it
is
on
rubber
also
i
fear
that
the
tragedy
which
i
am
about
to
relate
hangs
i
suppose
the
new
york
papers
have
had
nothing
to
say
of
the
strange
death
of
bradley
cushing
a
young
chemist
in
goodyear
who
was
formerly
employed
by
the
mills
but
had
lately
set
up
a
little
laboratory
of
his
own
kennedy
turned
to
me
nothing
unless
the
late
editions
of
the
evening
papers
have
it
i
replied
perhaps
it
is
just
as
well
continued
winslow
they
have
it
straight
in
fact
no
one
has
it
straight
yet
that
is
why
we
have
come
to
you
you
see
to
my
way
of
thinking
bradley
cushing
was
on
the
road
to
changing
the
name
of
the
town
from
goodyear
to
cushing
he
was
not
the
inventor
of
synthetic
rubber
about
which
you
hear
nowadays
but
he
had
improved
the
process
so
much
that
there
is
no
doubt
that
synthetic
rubber
would
soon
have
been
on
the
market
cheaper
and
better
than
the
best
natural
rubber
from
para
goodyear
is
not
a
large
place
but
it
is
famous
for
its
rubber
and
uses
a
great
deal
of
raw
material
we
have
sent
out
some
of
the
best
men
in
the
business
seeking
new
sources
in
south
america
in
mexico
in
ceylon
malaysia
and
the
congo
what
our
people
do
not
know
about
rubber
is
hardly
worth
knowing
from
the
crude
gum
to
the
thousands
of
forms
of
finished
products
goodyear
is
a
wealthy
little
town
too
for
its
size
naturally
all
its
investments
are
in
rubber
not
only
in
our
own
mills
but
in
companies
all
over
the
world
last
year
several
of
our
leading
citizens
became
interested
in
a
new
concession
in
the
congo
granted
to
a
group
of
american
capitalists
among
whom
was
lewis
borland
who
is
easily
the
local
magnate
of
our
town
when
this
group
organised
an
expedition
to
explore
the
region
preparatory
to
taking
up
the
concession
several
of
the
best
known
people
in
goodyear
accompanied
the
party
and
later
subscribed
for
large
blocks
of
stock
i
say
all
this
so
that
you
will
understand
at
the
start
just
what
part
rubber
plays
in
the
life
of
our
little
community
you
can
readily
see
that
such
being
the
case
whatever
advantage
the
world
at
large
might
gain
from
cheap
synthetic
rubber
would
scarcely
benefit
those
whose
money
and
labour
had
been
expended
on
the
assumption
that
rubber
would
be
scarce
and
dear
naturally
then
bradley
cushing
was
not
precisely
popular
with
a
certain
set
in
goodyear
as
for
myself
i
am
frank
to
admit
that
i
might
have
shared
the
opinion
of
many
others
regarding
him
for
i
have
a
small
investment
in
this
congo
enterprise
myself
but
the
fact
is
that
cushing
when
he
came
to
our
town
fresh
from
his
college
fellowship
in
industrial
chemistry
met
my
daughter
without
taking
his
eyes
off
kennedy
he
reached
over
and
patted
the
gloved
hand
that
clutched
the
arm
of
the
chair
alongside
his
own
they
were
engaged
and
often
they
used
to
talk
over
what
they
would
do
when
bradley
invention
of
a
new
way
to
polymerise
isoprene
as
the
process
is
called
had
solved
the
rubber
question
and
had
made
him
rich
i
firmly
believe
that
their
dreams
were
not
day
dreams
either
the
thing
was
done
i
have
seen
his
products
and
i
know
something
about
rubber
there
were
no
impurities
in
his
rubber
winslow
paused
ruth
was
sobbing
quietly
this
morning
he
resumed
hastily
bradley
cushing
was
found
dead
in
his
laboratory
under
the
most
peculiar
circumstances
i
do
not
know
whether
his
secret
died
with
him
or
whether
some
one
has
stolen
it
from
the
indications
i
concluded
that
he
had
been
murdered
such
was
the
case
as
kennedy
and
i
heard
it
then
ruth
looked
up
at
him
with
tearful
eyes
wistful
with
pain
would
kennedy
work
on
it
there
was
only
one
answer
xv
the
vampire
as
we
sped
out
to
the
little
on
the
last
train
after
kennedy
had
insisted
on
taking
us
all
to
a
quiet
little
restaurant
he
placed
us
so
that
miss
winslow
was
furthest
from
him
and
her
father
nearest
i
could
hear
now
and
then
scraps
of
their
conversation
as
he
resumed
his
questioning
and
knew
that
winslow
was
proving
to
be
a
good
observer
cushing
used
to
hire
a
young
fellow
of
some
scientific
experience
named
strong
said
winslow
as
he
endeavoured
to
piece
the
facts
together
as
logically
as
it
was
possible
to
do
strong
used
to
open
his
laboratory
for
him
in
the
morning
clean
up
the
dirty
apparatus
and
often
assist
him
in
some
of
his
experiments
this
morning
when
strong
approached
the
laboratory
at
the
usual
time
he
was
surprised
to
see
that
though
it
was
broad
daylight
there
was
a
light
burning
he
was
alarmed
and
before
going
in
looked
through
the
window
the
sight
that
he
saw
froze
him
there
lay
cushing
on
a
workbench
and
beside
him
and
around
him
pools
of
coagulating
blood
the
door
was
not
locked
as
we
found
afterward
but
the
young
man
did
not
stop
to
enter
he
ran
to
me
and
fortunately
i
met
him
at
our
door
i
went
back
we
opened
the
unlocked
door
the
first
thing
as
i
recall
it
that
greeted
me
was
an
unmistakable
odour
of
oranges
it
was
a
very
penetrating
and
very
peculiar
odour
i
did
understand
it
for
there
seemed
to
be
something
else
in
it
besides
the
orange
smell
however
i
soon
found
out
what
it
was
or
at
least
strong
did
i
do
know
whether
you
know
anything
about
it
but
it
seems
that
when
you
melt
real
rubber
in
the
effort
to
reduce
it
to
carbon
and
hydrogen
you
get
a
liquid
substance
which
is
known
as
isoprene
well
isoprene
according
to
strong
gives
out
an
odour
something
like
ether
cushing
or
some
one
else
had
apparently
been
heating
isoprene
as
soon
as
strong
mentioned
the
smell
of
ether
i
recognised
that
that
was
what
made
the
smell
of
oranges
so
peculiar
however
that
not
the
point
there
lay
cushing
on
his
back
on
the
workbench
just
as
strong
had
said
i
bent
over
him
and
in
his
arm
which
was
bare
i
saw
a
little
gash
made
by
some
sharp
instrument
and
laying
bare
an
artery
i
think
which
was
cut
long
spurts
of
blood
covered
the
floor
for
some
distance
around
and
from
the
veins
in
his
arm
which
had
also
been
severed
a
long
stream
of
blood
led
to
a
hollow
in
the
cement
floor
where
it
had
collected
i
believe
that
he
bled
to
death
and
the
motive
for
such
a
terrible
crime
queried
craig
winslow
shook
his
head
helplessly
i
suppose
there
are
plenty
of
motives
he
answered
slowly
as
many
motives
as
there
are
big
investments
in
ventures
in
goodyear
but
have
you
any
idea
who
would
go
so
far
to
protect
his
investments
as
to
kill
persisted
kennedy
winslow
made
no
reply
who
asked
kennedy
was
chiefly
interested
in
the
rubber
works
where
cushing
was
formerly
employed
the
president
of
the
company
is
the
borland
whom
i
mentioned
replied
winslow
he
is
a
man
of
about
forty
i
should
say
and
is
reputed
to
own
a
majority
of
the
oh
father
interrupted
miss
winslow
who
had
caught
the
drift
of
the
conversation
in
spite
of
the
pains
that
had
been
taken
to
keep
it
away
from
her
borland
would
never
dream
of
such
a
thing
it
is
wrong
even
to
think
of
it
i
did
say
that
he
would
my
dear
corrected
winslow
gently
professor
kennedy
asked
me
who
was
chiefly
interested
in
the
rubber
works
and
borland
owns
a
majority
of
the
stock
he
leaned
over
and
whispered
to
kennedy
borland
is
a
visitor
at
our
home
and
between
you
and
me
he
thinks
a
great
deal
of
ruth
i
looked
quickly
at
kennedy
but
he
was
absorbed
in
looking
out
of
the
car
window
at
the
landscape
which
he
did
not
and
could
not
see
you
said
there
were
others
who
had
an
interest
in
outside
companies
kennedy
i
take
it
that
you
mean
companies
dealing
in
crude
rubber
the
raw
material
people
with
investments
in
plantations
and
concessions
perhaps
who
are
they
who
were
the
men
who
went
on
that
expedition
to
the
congo
with
borland
which
you
mentioned
of
course
there
was
borland
himself
answered
winslow
then
there
was
a
young
chemist
named
lathrop
a
very
clever
and
ambitious
fellow
who
succeeded
cushing
when
he
resigned
from
the
works
and
harris
who
was
persuaded
to
go
because
of
his
friendship
for
borland
after
they
took
up
the
concession
i
believe
all
of
them
put
money
into
it
though
how
much
i
ca
say
i
was
curious
to
ask
whether
there
were
any
other
visitors
at
the
winslow
house
who
might
be
rivals
for
ruth
affections
but
there
was
no
opportunity
nothing
more
was
said
until
we
arrived
at
goodyear
we
found
the
body
of
cushing
lying
in
a
modest
little
mortuary
chapel
of
an
undertaking
establishment
on
the
main
street
kennedy
at
once
began
his
investigation
by
discovering
what
seemed
to
have
escaped
others
about
the
throat
were
light
discolourations
that
showed
that
the
young
inventor
had
been
choked
by
a
man
with
a
powerful
grasp
although
the
fact
that
the
marks
had
escaped
observation
led
quite
obviously
to
the
conclusion
that
he
had
not
met
his
death
in
that
way
and
that
the
marks
probably
played
only
a
minor
part
in
the
tragedy
kennedy
passed
over
the
doubtful
evidence
of
strangulation
for
the
more
profitable
examination
of
the
little
gash
in
the
wrist
the
radial
artery
has
been
cut
he
mused
a
low
exclamation
from
him
brought
us
all
bending
over
him
as
he
stooped
and
examined
the
cold
form
he
was
holding
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
a
little
piece
of
something
that
shone
like
silver
it
was
in
the
form
of
a
minute
hollow
cylinder
with
two
grooves
on
it
a
cylinder
so
tiny
that
it
would
scarcely
have
slipped
over
the
point
of
a
pencil
where
did
you
find
it
i
asked
eagerly
he
pointed
to
the
wound
sticking
in
the
severed
end
of
a
piece
of
vein
he
replied
half
to
himself
cuffed
over
the
end
of
the
radial
artery
which
had
been
severed
and
done
so
neatly
as
to
be
practically
hidden
it
was
done
so
cleverly
that
the
inner
linings
of
the
vein
and
artery
the
endothelium
as
it
is
called
were
in
complete
contact
with
each
other
as
i
looked
at
the
little
silver
thing
and
at
kennedy
face
which
betrayed
nothing
i
felt
that
here
indeed
was
a
mystery
what
new
scientific
engine
of
death
was
that
little
hollow
cylinder
next
i
should
like
to
visit
the
laboratory
he
remarked
simply
fortunately
the
laboratory
had
been
shut
and
nothing
had
been
disturbed
except
by
the
undertaker
and
his
men
who
had
carried
the
body
away
strong
had
left
word
that
he
had
gone
to
boston
where
in
a
safe
deposit
box
was
a
sealed
envelope
in
which
cushing
kept
a
copy
of
the
combination
of
his
safe
which
had
died
with
him
there
was
therefore
no
hope
of
seeing
the
assistant
until
the
morning
kennedy
found
plenty
to
occupy
his
time
in
his
minute
investigation
of
the
laboratory
there
for
instance
was
the
pool
of
blood
leading
back
by
a
thin
dark
stream
to
the
workbench
and
its
terrible
figure
which
i
could
almost
picture
to
myself
lying
there
through
the
silent
hours
of
the
night
before
with
its
life
blood
slowly
oozing
away
unconscious
powerless
to
save
itself
there
were
spurts
of
arterial
blood
on
the
floor
and
on
the
nearby
laboratory
furniture
and
beside
the
workbench
another
smaller
and
isolated
pool
of
blood
on
a
table
in
a
corner
by
the
window
stood
a
microscope
which
cushing
evidently
used
and
near
it
a
box
of
fresh
sterilised
slides
kennedy
who
had
been
casting
his
eye
carefully
about
taking
in
the
whole
laboratory
seemed
delighted
to
find
the
slides
he
opened
the
box
and
gingerly
took
out
some
of
the
little
oblong
pieces
of
glass
on
each
of
which
he
dropped
a
couple
of
minute
drops
of
blood
from
the
arterial
spurts
and
the
venous
pools
on
the
floor
near
the
workbench
were
circular
marks
much
as
if
some
jars
had
been
set
down
there
we
were
watching
him
almost
in
awe
at
the
matter
of
fact
manner
in
which
he
was
proceeding
in
what
to
us
was
nothing
but
a
hopeless
enigma
when
i
saw
him
stoop
and
pick
up
a
few
little
broken
pieces
of
glass
there
seemed
to
be
blood
spots
on
the
glass
as
on
other
things
but
particularly
interesting
to
him
a
moment
later
i
saw
that
he
was
holding
in
his
hand
what
were
apparently
the
remains
of
a
little
broken
vial
which
he
had
fitted
together
from
the
pieces
evidently
it
had
been
used
and
dropped
in
haste
a
vial
for
a
local
anesthetic
he
remarked
this
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
might
be
injected
into
an
arm
or
leg
and
deaden
the
pain
of
a
cut
but
that
is
all
it
would
affect
the
consciousness
or
prevent
any
one
from
resisting
a
murderer
to
the
last
i
doubt
if
that
had
anything
directly
to
do
with
his
death
or
perhaps
even
that
this
is
cushing
blood
on
it
unlike
winslow
i
had
seen
kennedy
in
action
so
many
times
that
i
knew
it
was
useless
to
speculate
but
i
was
fascinated
for
the
deeper
we
got
into
the
case
the
more
unusual
and
inexplicable
it
seemed
i
gave
that
end
of
it
up
but
the
fact
that
strong
had
gone
to
secure
the
combination
of
the
safe
suggested
to
me
to
examine
that
article
there
was
certainly
no
evidence
of
robbery
or
even
of
an
attempt
at
robbery
there
was
any
doctor
called
asked
kennedy
yes
he
replied
though
i
knew
it
was
of
no
use
i
called
in
howe
who
lives
up
the
street
from
the
laboratory
i
should
have
called
harris
who
used
to
be
my
own
physician
but
since
his
return
from
africa
with
the
borland
expedition
he
has
not
been
in
very
good
health
and
has
practically
given
up
his
practice
howe
is
the
best
practising
physician
in
town
i
think
we
shall
call
on
him
said
craig
snapping
his
watch
which
already
marked
far
after
midnight
howe
proved
the
next
day
to
be
an
man
and
i
could
not
help
noticing
and
admiring
his
powerful
frame
and
his
hearty
handshake
as
he
greeted
us
when
we
dropped
into
his
office
with
a
card
from
winslow
the
doctor
theory
was
that
cushing
had
committed
suicide
but
why
should
a
young
man
who
had
invented
a
new
method
of
polymerising
isoprene
who
was
going
to
become
wealthy
and
was
engaged
to
a
beautiful
young
girl
commit
suicide
the
doctor
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
was
evident
that
he
too
belonged
to
the
natural
rubber
set
which
dominated
goodyear
i
have
looked
into
the
case
very
deeply
but
i
not
so
sure
that
he
had
the
secret
are
you
kennedy
smiled
that
is
what
i
like
to
know
i
suppose
that
an
expert
like
borland
could
tell
me
perhaps
i
should
think
so
where
is
his
office
asked
craig
could
you
point
it
out
to
me
from
the
window
kennedy
was
standing
by
one
of
the
windows
of
the
doctor
office
and
as
he
spoke
he
turned
and
drew
a
little
field
glass
from
his
pocket
which
end
of
the
rubber
works
is
it
howe
tried
to
direct
him
but
kennedy
appeared
unwarrantably
obtuse
requiring
the
doctor
to
raise
the
window
and
it
was
some
moments
before
he
got
his
glasses
on
the
right
spot
kennedy
and
i
thanked
the
doctor
for
his
courtesy
and
left
the
office
we
went
at
once
to
the
office
of
harris
to
whom
winslow
had
also
given
us
cards
we
found
him
an
anaemic
man
half
asleep
kennedy
tentatively
suggested
the
murder
of
cushing
well
if
you
ask
me
my
opinion
snapped
out
the
doctor
although
i
was
called
into
the
case
from
what
i
hear
i
say
that
he
was
murdered
some
seem
to
think
it
was
suicide
prompted
kennedy
people
who
have
brilliant
prospects
and
are
engaged
to
pretty
girls
do
usually
die
of
their
own
accord
rasped
harris
so
you
think
he
really
did
have
the
secret
of
artificial
rubber
asked
craig
not
artificial
rubber
synthetic
rubber
it
was
the
real
thing
i
believe
did
borland
and
his
new
chemist
lathrop
believe
it
too
i
ca
say
but
i
should
surely
advise
you
to
see
them
the
face
was
twitching
nervously
where
is
borland
office
repeated
kennedy
again
taking
from
his
pocket
the
field
glass
and
adjusting
it
carefully
by
the
window
over
there
directed
harris
indicating
the
corner
of
the
works
to
which
we
had
already
been
directed
kennedy
had
stepped
closer
to
the
window
before
him
and
i
stood
beside
him
looking
out
also
the
cut
was
a
very
peculiar
one
remarked
kennedy
still
adjusting
the
glasses
an
artery
and
a
vein
had
been
placed
together
so
that
the
endothelium
or
inner
lining
of
each
was
in
contact
with
the
other
giving
a
continuous
serous
surface
which
window
did
you
say
was
borland
i
wish
you
step
to
the
other
window
and
raise
it
so
that
i
can
be
sure
i
do
want
to
go
wandering
all
over
the
works
looking
for
him
yes
the
doctor
said
as
he
went
leaving
him
standing
beside
the
window
from
which
he
had
been
directing
us
yes
you
surely
should
see
borland
and
do
forget
that
young
chemist
of
his
lathrop
either
if
i
can
be
of
any
more
help
to
you
come
back
again
it
was
a
long
walk
through
the
village
and
factory
yards
to
the
office
of
lewis
borland
but
we
were
amply
repaid
by
finding
him
in
and
ready
to
see
us
borland
was
a
typical
yankee
tall
thin
evidently
predisposed
to
indigestion
a
man
of
tremendous
mental
and
nervous
energy
and
with
a
hidden
wiry
strength
borland
introduced
kennedy
changing
his
tactics
and
adopting
a
new
role
i
come
down
to
you
as
an
authority
on
rubber
to
ask
you
what
your
opinion
is
regarding
the
invention
of
a
townsman
of
yours
named
cushing
cushing
repeated
borland
in
some
surprise
why
yes
interrupted
kennedy
i
understand
all
about
it
i
had
heard
of
his
invention
in
new
york
and
would
have
put
some
money
into
it
if
i
could
have
been
convinced
i
was
to
see
him
but
of
course
as
you
were
going
to
say
his
death
prevents
it
still
i
should
like
to
know
what
you
think
about
it
well
borland
added
jerking
out
his
words
nervously
as
seemed
to
be
his
habit
cushing
was
a
bright
young
fellow
he
used
to
work
for
me
until
he
began
to
know
too
much
about
the
rubber
business
do
you
know
anything
about
his
scheme
insinuated
kennedy
very
little
except
that
it
was
not
patented
yet
i
believe
though
he
told
every
one
that
the
patent
was
applied
for
and
he
expected
to
get
a
basic
patent
in
some
way
without
any
interference
well
drawled
kennedy
affecting
as
nearly
as
possible
the
air
of
a
promoter
if
i
could
get
his
assistant
or
some
one
who
had
authority
to
be
present
would
you
as
a
practical
rubber
man
go
over
to
his
laboratory
with
me
i
join
you
in
making
an
offer
to
his
estate
for
the
rights
to
the
process
if
it
seemed
any
good
you
a
cool
one
ejaculated
borland
with
a
peculiar
avaricious
twinkle
in
the
corners
of
his
eyes
his
body
is
scarcely
cold
and
yet
you
come
around
proposing
to
buy
out
his
invention
and
and
of
all
persons
you
come
to
me
to
you
inquired
kennedy
blandly
yes
to
me
do
you
know
that
synthetic
rubber
would
ruin
the
business
system
that
i
have
built
up
here
still
craig
persisted
and
argued
young
man
said
borland
rising
at
length
as
if
an
idea
had
struck
him
i
like
your
nerve
yes
i
will
go
i
show
you
that
i
fear
any
competition
from
rubber
made
out
of
fusel
oil
or
any
other
old
kind
of
oil
he
rang
a
bell
and
a
boy
answered
call
lathrop
he
ordered
the
young
chemist
lathrop
proved
to
be
a
bright
and
active
man
of
the
new
school
though
a
good
deal
of
a
rubber
stamp
whenever
it
was
compatible
with
science
and
art
he
readily
assented
to
every
proposition
that
his
employer
laid
down
kennedy
had
already
telephoned
to
the
winslows
and
miss
winslow
had
answered
that
strong
had
returned
from
boston
after
a
little
parleying
the
second
visit
to
the
laboratory
was
arranged
and
miss
winslow
was
allowed
to
be
present
with
her
father
after
kennedy
had
been
assured
by
strong
that
the
gruesome
relics
of
the
tragedy
would
be
cleared
away
it
was
in
the
forenoon
that
we
arrived
with
borland
and
lathrop
i
could
not
help
noticing
the
cordial
manner
with
which
borland
greeted
miss
winslow
there
was
something
obtrusive
even
in
his
sympathy
strong
whom
we
met
now
for
the
first
time
seemed
rather
suspicious
of
the
presence
of
borland
and
his
chemist
but
made
an
effort
to
talk
freely
without
telling
too
much
of
course
you
know
commenced
strong
after
proper
urging
that
it
has
long
been
the
desire
of
chemists
to
synthesise
rubber
by
a
method
that
will
make
possible
its
cheap
production
on
a
large
scale
in
a
general
way
i
know
what
cushing
had
done
but
there
are
parts
of
the
process
which
are
covered
in
the
patents
applied
for
of
which
i
am
not
at
liberty
to
speak
yet
where
are
the
papers
in
the
case
the
documents
showing
the
application
for
the
patent
for
instance
asked
kennedy
in
the
safe
sir
replied
strong
strong
set
to
work
on
the
combination
which
he
had
obtained
from
the
safe
deposit
vault
i
could
see
that
borland
and
miss
winslow
were
talking
in
a
low
tone
are
you
sure
that
it
is
a
fact
i
overheard
him
ask
though
i
had
no
idea
what
they
were
talking
about
as
sure
as
i
am
that
the
borland
rubber
works
are
a
fact
she
replied
craig
also
seemed
to
have
overheard
for
he
turned
quickly
borland
had
taken
out
his
penknife
and
was
moistening
the
blade
carefully
preparing
to
cut
into
a
piece
of
the
synthetic
rubber
in
spite
of
his
expressed
scepticism
i
could
see
that
he
was
eager
to
learn
what
the
product
was
really
like
strong
meanwhile
had
opened
the
safe
and
was
going
over
the
papers
a
low
exclamation
from
him
brought
us
around
the
little
pile
of
documents
he
was
holding
a
will
in
which
nearly
everything
belonging
to
cushing
was
left
to
miss
winslow
not
a
word
was
said
although
i
noticed
that
kennedy
moved
quickly
to
her
side
fearing
that
the
shock
of
the
discovery
might
have
a
bad
effect
on
her
but
she
took
it
with
remarkable
calmness
it
was
apparent
that
cushing
had
taken
the
step
of
his
own
accord
and
had
said
nothing
to
her
about
it
what
does
anything
amount
to
she
said
tremulously
at
last
the
dream
is
dead
without
him
in
it
come
urged
kennedy
gently
this
is
enough
for
an
hour
later
we
were
speeding
back
to
new
york
kennedy
had
no
apparatus
to
work
with
out
at
goodyear
and
could
not
improvise
it
winslow
agreed
to
keep
us
in
touch
with
any
new
developments
during
the
few
hours
that
craig
felt
it
was
necessary
to
leave
the
scene
of
action
back
again
in
new
york
craig
took
a
cab
directly
for
his
laboratory
leaving
me
marooned
with
instructions
not
to
bother
him
for
several
hours
i
employed
the
time
in
a
little
sleuthing
on
my
own
account
endeavouring
to
look
up
the
records
of
those
involved
in
the
case
i
did
not
discover
much
except
an
interview
that
had
been
given
at
the
time
of
the
return
of
his
expedition
by
borland
to
the
star
in
which
he
gave
a
graphic
description
of
the
dangers
from
disease
that
they
had
encountered
i
mention
it
because
though
it
did
not
impress
me
much
when
i
read
it
it
at
once
leaped
into
my
mind
when
the
interminable
hours
were
over
and
i
rejoined
kennedy
he
was
bending
over
a
new
microscope
this
is
a
rubber
age
walter
he
began
and
the
stories
of
men
who
have
been
interested
in
rubber
often
sound
like
fiction
he
slipped
a
slide
under
the
microscope
looked
at
it
and
then
motioned
to
me
to
do
the
same
here
is
a
very
peculiar
culture
which
i
have
found
in
some
of
that
blood
he
commented
the
germs
are
much
larger
than
bacteria
and
they
can
be
seen
with
a
comparatively
low
power
microscope
swiftly
darting
between
the
blood
cells
brushing
them
aside
but
not
penetrating
them
as
some
parasites
like
that
of
malaria
do
besides
spectroscope
tests
show
the
presence
of
a
rather
chemical
in
that
blood
a
poisoning
then
i
ventured
perhaps
he
suffered
from
the
disease
that
many
rubber
workers
get
from
the
bisulphide
of
carbon
he
must
have
done
a
good
deal
of
vulcanising
of
his
own
rubber
you
know
no
smiled
craig
enigmatically
it
was
that
it
was
an
arsenic
derivative
here
another
thing
you
remember
the
field
glass
i
used
he
had
picked
it
up
from
the
table
and
was
pointing
at
a
little
hole
in
the
side
that
had
escaped
my
notice
before
this
is
what
you
might
call
a
camera
i
point
the
glass
out
of
the
window
and
while
you
think
i
am
looking
through
it
i
am
really
focusing
it
on
you
and
taking
your
picture
standing
there
beside
me
and
out
of
my
apparent
line
of
vision
it
would
deceive
the
most
wary
just
then
a
call
from
winslow
told
us
that
borland
had
been
to
call
on
miss
ruth
and
in
as
kindly
a
way
as
could
be
had
offered
her
half
a
million
dollars
for
her
rights
in
the
new
patent
at
once
it
flashed
over
me
that
he
was
trying
to
get
control
of
and
suppress
the
invention
in
the
interests
of
his
own
company
a
thing
that
has
been
done
hundreds
of
times
or
could
it
all
have
been
part
of
a
conspiracy
and
if
it
was
his
conspiracy
would
he
succeed
in
tempting
his
friend
miss
winslow
to
fall
in
with
this
glittering
offer
kennedy
evidently
thought
also
that
the
time
for
action
had
come
for
without
a
word
he
set
to
work
packing
his
apparatus
and
we
were
again
headed
for
goodyear
xvi
the
blood
test
we
arrived
late
at
night
or
rather
in
the
morning
but
in
spite
of
the
late
hour
kennedy
was
up
early
urging
me
to
help
him
carry
the
stuff
over
to
cushing
laboratory
by
the
middle
of
the
morning
he
was
ready
and
had
me
scouring
about
town
collecting
his
audience
which
consisted
of
the
winslows
borland
and
lathrop
howe
harris
strong
and
myself
the
laboratory
was
darkened
and
kennedy
took
his
place
beside
an
electric
moving
picture
apparatus
the
first
picture
was
different
from
anything
any
of
us
had
ever
seen
on
a
screen
before
it
seemed
to
be
a
mass
of
little
dancing
globules
this
explained
kennedy
is
what
you
would
call
an
educational
moving
picture
i
suppose
it
shows
normal
blood
corpuscles
as
they
are
in
motion
in
the
blood
of
a
healthy
man
those
little
round
cells
are
the
red
corpuscles
and
the
larger
irregular
cells
are
the
white
corpuscles
he
stopped
the
film
the
next
picture
was
a
sort
of
enlarged
and
elongated
house
fly
apparently
of
sombre
grey
color
with
a
narrow
body
thick
proboscis
and
wings
that
overlapped
like
the
blades
of
a
pair
of
shears
this
he
went
on
is
a
picture
of
the
now
well
known
fly
found
over
a
large
area
of
africa
it
has
a
bite
something
like
a
and
is
a
perfect
vast
territories
of
thickly
populated
fertile
country
near
the
shores
of
lakes
and
rivers
are
now
depopulated
as
a
result
of
the
bite
of
these
flies
more
deadly
than
the
vampirish
ghosts
with
which
in
the
middle
ages
people
supposed
night
air
to
be
inhabited
for
this
fly
carries
with
it
germs
which
it
leaves
in
the
blood
of
its
victims
which
i
shall
show
next
a
new
film
started
here
is
a
picture
of
some
blood
so
infected
notice
that
sheath
of
undulating
membrane
terminating
in
a
slender
process
by
which
it
moves
about
that
thing
wriggling
about
like
a
minute
electric
eel
always
in
motion
is
known
as
the
trypanosome
is
this
a
marvellous
picture
to
see
the
move
evolve
and
revolve
in
the
midst
of
normal
cells
uncoil
and
undulate
in
the
fluids
which
they
inhabit
to
see
them
play
hide
and
seek
with
the
blood
corpuscles
and
clumps
of
fibrin
turn
twist
and
rotate
as
if
in
a
cage
to
see
these
deadly
little
trypanosomes
moving
back
and
forth
in
every
direction
displaying
their
delicate
undulating
membranes
and
shoving
aside
the
blood
cells
that
are
in
their
way
while
by
their
side
the
leucocytes
or
white
corpuscles
lazily
extend
or
retract
their
pseudopods
of
protoplasm
to
see
all
this
as
it
is
shown
before
us
here
is
to
realise
that
we
are
in
the
presence
of
an
unknown
world
a
world
infinitesimally
small
but
as
real
and
as
complex
as
that
about
us
with
the
cinematograph
and
the
we
can
see
what
no
other
forms
of
photography
can
reproduce
i
have
secured
these
pictures
so
that
i
can
better
mass
up
the
evidence
against
a
certain
person
in
this
room
for
in
the
blood
of
one
of
you
is
now
going
on
the
fight
which
you
have
here
seen
portrayed
by
the
picture
machine
notice
how
the
blood
corpuscles
in
this
infected
blood
have
lost
their
smooth
glossy
appearance
become
granular
and
incapable
of
nourishing
the
tissues
the
trypanosomes
are
fighting
with
the
normal
blood
cells
here
we
have
the
lowest
group
of
animal
life
the
protozoa
at
work
killing
the
highest
man
kennedy
needed
nothing
more
than
the
breathless
stillness
to
convince
him
of
the
effectiveness
of
his
method
of
presenting
his
case
now
he
resumed
let
us
leave
this
vampirish
fly
for
the
moment
i
have
another
revelation
to
make
he
laid
down
on
the
table
under
the
lights
which
now
flashed
up
again
the
little
hollow
silver
cylinder
this
little
instrument
kennedy
explained
which
i
have
here
is
known
as
a
canula
a
little
canal
for
leading
off
blood
from
the
veins
of
one
person
to
another
in
other
words
blood
transfusion
modern
doctors
are
proving
themselves
quite
successful
in
its
use
of
course
like
everything
it
has
its
own
peculiar
dangers
but
the
one
point
i
wish
to
make
is
this
in
the
selection
of
a
donor
for
transfusion
people
fall
into
definite
groups
tests
of
blood
must
be
made
first
to
see
whether
it
and
in
this
respect
there
are
four
classes
of
persons
in
our
case
this
matter
had
to
be
neglected
for
gentlemen
there
were
two
kinds
of
blood
on
that
laboratory
floor
and
they
do
not
agglutinate
this
in
short
was
what
actually
happened
an
attempt
was
made
to
transfuse
cushing
blood
as
donor
to
another
person
as
recipient
a
man
suffering
from
the
disease
caught
from
the
bite
of
the
fly
the
deadly
sleeping
sickness
so
well
known
in
africa
has
deliberately
tried
a
form
of
robbery
which
i
believe
to
be
without
parallel
he
has
stolen
the
blood
of
another
he
stole
it
in
a
desperate
attempt
to
stay
an
incurable
disease
this
man
had
used
an
arsenic
compound
called
atoxyl
till
his
blood
was
filled
with
it
and
its
effects
on
the
trypanosomes
nil
there
was
but
one
wild
experiment
more
to
try
the
stolen
blood
of
another
craig
paused
to
let
the
horror
of
the
crime
sink
into
our
minds
some
one
in
the
party
which
went
to
look
over
the
concession
in
the
congo
contracted
the
sleeping
sickness
from
the
bites
of
those
flies
that
person
has
now
reached
the
stage
of
insanity
and
his
blood
is
full
of
the
germs
and
overloaded
with
atoxyl
everything
had
been
tried
and
had
failed
he
was
doomed
he
saw
his
fortune
menaced
by
the
discovery
of
the
way
to
make
synthetic
rubber
life
and
money
were
at
stake
one
night
nerved
up
by
a
fit
of
insane
fury
with
a
power
far
beyond
what
one
would
expect
in
his
ordinary
weakened
condition
he
saw
a
light
in
cushing
laboratory
he
stole
in
stealthily
he
seized
the
inventor
with
his
momentarily
superhuman
strength
and
choked
him
as
they
struggled
he
must
have
shoved
a
sponge
soaked
with
ether
and
orange
essence
under
his
nose
cushing
went
under
resistance
overcome
by
the
anesthetic
he
dragged
the
now
insensible
form
to
the
work
bench
frantically
he
must
have
worked
he
made
an
incision
and
exposed
the
radial
artery
the
pulse
then
he
must
have
administered
a
local
anesthetic
to
himself
in
his
arm
or
leg
he
secured
a
vein
and
pushed
the
cut
end
over
this
little
canula
then
he
fitted
the
artery
of
cushing
over
that
and
the
blood
that
was
perhaps
to
save
his
life
began
flowing
into
his
depleted
veins
who
was
this
madman
i
have
watched
the
actions
of
those
whom
i
suspected
when
they
did
not
know
they
were
being
watched
i
did
it
by
using
this
neat
little
device
which
looks
like
a
field
glass
but
is
really
a
camera
that
takes
pictures
of
things
at
right
angles
to
the
direction
in
which
the
glass
seems
to
be
pointed
one
person
i
found
had
a
wound
on
his
leg
the
wrapping
of
which
he
adjusted
nervously
when
he
thought
no
one
was
looking
he
had
difficulty
in
limping
even
a
short
distance
to
open
a
window
kennedy
uncorked
a
bottle
and
the
subtle
odor
of
oranges
mingled
with
ether
stole
through
the
room
some
one
here
will
recognize
that
odour
immediately
it
is
the
new
vapour
anesthetic
a
mixture
of
essence
of
orange
with
ether
and
chloroform
the
odour
hidden
by
the
orange
which
lingered
in
the
laboratory
winslow
and
strong
was
not
isoprene
but
really
ether
i
am
letting
some
of
the
odour
escape
here
because
in
this
very
laboratory
it
was
that
the
thing
took
place
and
it
is
one
of
the
principles
of
psychology
that
odours
are
powerfully
suggestive
in
this
case
the
odour
now
must
suggest
the
terrible
scene
of
the
other
night
to
some
one
before
me
more
than
that
i
have
to
tell
that
person
that
the
blood
transfusion
did
not
and
could
not
save
him
his
illness
is
due
to
a
condition
that
is
incurable
and
can
not
be
altered
by
transfusion
of
new
blood
that
person
is
just
as
doomed
as
he
was
before
he
committed
a
figure
was
groping
blindly
about
the
arsenic
compounds
with
which
his
blood
was
surcharged
had
brought
on
one
of
the
attacks
of
blindness
to
which
users
of
the
drug
are
subject
in
his
insane
frenzy
he
was
evidently
reaching
desperately
for
kennedy
himself
as
he
groped
he
limped
painfully
from
the
soreness
of
his
wound
harris
accused
kennedy
avoiding
the
mad
rush
at
himself
and
speaking
in
a
tone
that
thrilled
us
you
are
the
man
who
sucked
the
blood
of
cushing
into
your
own
veins
and
left
him
to
die
but
the
state
will
never
be
able
to
exact
from
you
the
penalty
of
your
crime
nature
will
do
that
too
soon
for
justice
gentlemen
this
is
the
murderer
of
bradley
cushing
a
maniac
a
modern
scientific
vampire
i
regarded
the
broken
doomed
man
with
mingled
pity
and
loathing
rather
than
with
the
usual
feelings
one
has
toward
a
criminal
come
said
craig
the
local
authorities
can
take
care
of
this
case
now
he
paused
just
long
enough
for
a
word
of
comfort
to
the
poor
girl
both
winslow
answered
with
a
mute
look
of
gratitude
and
despair
in
fact
in
the
confusion
we
were
only
too
glad
to
escape
any
more
such
mournful
congratulations
well
craig
remarked
as
we
walked
quickly
down
the
street
if
we
have
to
wait
here
for
a
train
i
prefer
to
wait
in
the
railroad
station
i
have
done
my
part
now
my
only
interest
is
to
get
away
before
they
either
offer
me
a
banquet
or
lynch
me
actually
i
think
he
would
have
preferred
the
novelty
of
dealing
with
a
lynching
party
if
he
had
had
to
choose
between
the
two
we
caught
a
train
soon
however
and
fortunately
it
had
a
diner
attached
kennedy
whiled
away
the
time
between
courses
by
reading
the
graft
exposures
in
the
city
as
we
rolled
into
the
station
late
in
the
afternoon
he
tossed
aside
the
paper
with
an
air
of
relief
now
for
a
quiet
evening
in
the
laboratory
he
exclaimed
almost
gleefully
by
what
stretch
of
imagination
he
could
call
that
recreation
i
could
not
see
but
as
for
quietness
i
needed
it
too
i
had
fallen
wofully
behind
in
my
record
of
the
startling
events
through
which
he
was
conducting
me
consequently
until
late
that
night
i
pecked
away
at
my
typewriter
trying
to
get
order
out
of
the
chaos
of
my
hastily
scribbled
notes
under
ordinary
circumstances
i
remembered
the
morrow
would
have
been
my
day
of
rest
on
the
star
i
had
gone
far
enough
with
kennedy
to
realise
that
on
this
assignment
there
was
no
such
thing
as
rest
district
attorney
carton
wants
to
see
me
immediately
at
the
criminal
courts
building
walter
announced
kennedy
early
the
following
morning
clothed
and
as
much
in
my
right
mind
as
possible
after
the
arduous
literary
labours
of
the
night
before
i
needed
no
urging
for
carton
was
an
old
friend
of
all
the
newspaper
men
i
joined
craig
quickly
in
a
hasty
ride
in
the
rush
hour
on
the
table
before
the
fighting
prosecutor
whom
i
knew
already
after
many
a
long
and
campaign
both
before
and
after
election
lay
a
little
package
which
had
evidently
come
to
him
in
the
morning
mail
by
what
do
you
suppose
is
in
that
kennedy
he
asked
tapping
it
gingerly
i
have
opened
it
yet
but
i
think
it
a
bomb
wait
have
a
pail
of
water
sent
in
here
so
that
you
can
open
it
if
you
will
you
understand
such
things
no
no
hastened
kennedy
that
exactly
the
wrong
thing
to
do
some
of
these
modern
chemical
bombs
are
set
off
in
precisely
that
way
no
let
me
dissect
the
thing
carefully
i
think
you
may
be
right
it
does
look
as
if
it
might
be
an
infernal
machine
you
see
the
evident
disguise
of
the
roughly
written
address
carton
nodded
for
it
was
that
that
had
excited
his
suspicion
in
the
first
place
meanwhile
kennedy
without
further
ceremony
began
carefully
to
remove
the
wrapper
of
brown
manila
paper
preserving
everything
as
he
did
so
carton
and
i
instinctively
backed
away
inside
craig
had
disclosed
an
oblong
wooden
box
i
realise
that
opening
a
bomb
is
dangerous
business
he
pursued
slowly
engrossed
in
his
work
and
almost
oblivious
to
us
but
i
think
i
can
take
a
chance
safely
with
this
fellow
the
dangerous
part
is
what
might
be
called
drawing
the
fangs
no
bombs
are
exactly
safe
toys
to
have
around
until
they
are
wholly
destroyed
and
before
you
can
say
you
have
destroyed
one
it
is
rather
a
ticklish
business
to
take
out
the
dangerous
element
he
had
removed
the
cover
in
the
deftest
manner
without
friction
and
seemingly
without
disturbing
the
contents
in
the
least
i
do
not
pretend
to
know
how
he
did
it
but
the
proof
was
that
we
could
see
him
still
working
from
our
end
of
the
room
on
the
inside
of
the
cover
was
roughly
drawn
a
skull
and
showing
that
the
miscreant
who
sent
the
thing
had
at
least
a
sort
of
grim
humour
for
where
the
teeth
should
have
been
in
the
skull
were
innumerable
kennedy
picked
them
out
with
as
much
as
if
he
were
not
playing
jackstraws
with
life
and
death
then
he
removed
the
explosive
itself
and
the
various
murderous
slugs
and
bits
of
metal
embedded
in
it
carefully
separating
each
as
if
to
be
labelled
exhibit
a
b
and
so
on
for
a
class
in
bomb
dissection
finally
he
studied
the
sides
and
bottom
of
the
box
evidence
of
mixture
kennedy
muttered
to
himself
still
examining
the
bomb
the
inside
was
a
veritable
arsenal
a
very
unusual
and
clever
construction
my
heavens
breathed
carton
i
would
rather
go
through
a
campaign
again
xvii
the
bomb
maker
we
stared
at
each
other
in
blank
awe
at
the
various
parts
so
innocent
looking
in
the
heaps
on
the
table
now
safely
separated
but
together
a
combination
ticket
to
perdition
who
do
you
suppose
could
have
sent
it
i
blurted
out
when
i
found
my
voice
then
suddenly
recollecting
the
political
and
legal
fight
that
carton
was
engaged
in
at
the
time
i
added
the
white
slavers
not
a
doubt
he
returned
laconically
and
he
exclaimed
bringing
down
both
hands
vigorously
in
characteristic
emphasis
on
the
arms
of
his
office
chair
i
got
to
win
this
fight
against
the
vice
trust
as
i
call
it
or
the
whole
work
of
the
district
attorney
office
in
clearing
up
the
city
will
be
discredited
to
say
nothing
of
the
risk
the
present
incumbent
runs
at
having
such
grateful
friends
about
the
city
send
marks
of
their
affection
and
esteem
like
this
i
knew
something
already
of
the
situation
and
carton
continued
thoughtfully
all
the
powers
of
vice
are
fighting
a
battle
against
me
now
i
think
i
am
on
the
trail
of
the
man
or
men
higher
up
in
this
business
and
it
is
a
business
big
business
too
you
know
i
suppose
that
they
seem
to
have
a
string
of
hotels
in
the
city
of
the
worst
character
there
is
nothing
that
they
will
stop
at
to
protect
themselves
why
they
are
using
gangs
of
thugs
to
terrorise
any
one
who
informs
on
them
the
gunmen
of
course
hate
a
snitch
worse
than
poison
there
have
been
bomb
outrages
too
nearly
a
bomb
a
day
lately
against
some
of
those
who
look
shaky
and
seem
to
be
likely
to
do
business
with
my
office
but
i
getting
closer
all
the
time
how
do
you
mean
asked
kennedy
well
one
of
the
best
witnesses
if
i
can
break
him
down
by
pressure
and
promises
ought
to
be
a
man
named
haddon
who
is
running
a
place
in
the
fifties
known
as
the
mayfair
haddon
knows
all
these
people
i
can
get
him
in
half
an
hour
if
you
think
it
worth
while
not
here
but
somewhere
uptown
say
at
the
prince
henry
kennedy
nodded
we
had
heard
of
haddon
before
a
notorious
character
in
the
district
a
moment
later
carton
had
telephoned
to
the
mayfair
and
had
found
haddon
how
did
you
get
him
so
that
he
is
even
considering
turning
evidence
asked
craig
well
answered
carton
slowly
i
suppose
it
was
partly
through
a
cabaret
singer
and
dancer
loraine
keith
at
the
mayfair
you
know
you
never
get
the
truth
about
things
in
the
underworld
except
in
pieces
as
much
as
any
one
i
think
we
have
been
able
to
use
her
to
weave
a
web
about
him
besides
she
seems
to
think
that
haddon
has
treated
her
shamefully
according
to
her
story
he
seems
to
have
been
lavishing
everything
on
her
but
lately
for
some
reason
has
deserted
her
still
even
in
her
jealousy
she
does
not
accuse
any
other
woman
of
winning
him
away
perhaps
it
is
the
opposite
another
man
winning
her
suggested
craig
dryly
it
a
peculiar
situation
shrugged
carton
there
is
another
man
as
nearly
as
i
can
make
out
there
is
a
fellow
named
brodie
who
does
a
dance
with
her
but
he
seems
to
annoy
her
yet
at
the
same
time
exercises
a
sort
of
fascination
over
her
then
she
is
dancing
at
the
mayfair
yet
hastily
asked
craig
yes
i
told
her
to
stay
not
to
excite
suspicion
and
haddon
knows
oh
no
but
she
has
told
us
enough
about
him
already
so
that
we
can
worry
him
apparently
just
as
what
he
can
tell
us
would
worry
the
others
interested
in
the
hotels
to
tell
the
truth
i
think
she
is
a
drug
fiend
why
my
men
tell
me
that
they
have
seen
her
take
just
a
sniff
of
something
and
change
instantly
become
a
willing
tool
that
the
way
it
happens
commented
kennedy
now
i
go
up
there
and
meet
haddon
resumed
carton
after
i
have
been
with
him
long
enough
to
get
into
his
confidence
suppose
you
two
just
happen
along
half
an
hour
later
kennedy
and
i
sauntered
into
the
prince
henry
where
carton
had
made
the
appointment
in
order
to
avoid
suspicion
that
might
arise
if
he
were
seen
with
haddon
at
the
mayfair
the
two
men
were
waiting
for
us
haddon
by
contrast
with
carton
a
nervous
man
with
bulgy
eyes
haddon
introduced
carton
let
me
present
a
couple
of
reporters
from
the
star
off
duty
so
that
we
can
talk
freely
before
them
i
can
assure
you
good
fellows
too
haddon
the
hotel
and
cabaret
keeper
smiled
a
sickly
smile
and
greeted
us
with
a
covert
questioning
glance
this
attack
on
carton
has
unnerved
me
he
shivered
if
any
one
dares
to
do
that
to
him
what
will
they
do
to
me
do
get
cold
feet
haddon
urged
carton
you
be
all
right
swing
it
for
you
haddon
made
no
reply
at
length
he
remarked
you
excuse
me
for
a
moment
i
must
telephone
to
my
hotel
he
entered
a
booth
in
the
shadow
of
the
back
of
the
cafe
where
there
was
a
i
think
haddon
has
his
suspicions
remarked
carton
although
he
is
too
prudent
to
say
anything
yet
a
moment
later
he
returned
something
seemed
to
have
happened
he
looked
less
nervous
his
face
was
brighter
and
his
eyes
clearer
what
was
it
i
wondered
could
it
be
that
he
was
playing
a
game
with
carton
and
had
given
him
a
double
cross
i
was
quite
surprised
at
his
next
remark
carton
he
said
confidently
i
stick
good
exclaimed
the
district
attorney
as
they
fell
into
a
conversation
in
low
tones
by
the
way
drawled
kennedy
i
must
telephone
to
the
office
in
case
they
need
me
he
had
risen
and
entered
the
same
booth
haddon
and
carton
were
still
talking
earnestly
it
was
evident
that
for
some
reason
haddon
had
lost
his
former
halting
manner
perhaps
i
reasoned
the
bomb
episode
had
after
all
thrown
a
scare
into
him
and
he
felt
that
he
needed
protection
against
his
own
associates
who
were
quick
to
discover
such
dealings
as
carton
had
forced
him
into
i
rose
and
lounged
back
to
the
booth
and
kennedy
whom
did
he
call
i
whispered
when
craig
emerged
perspiring
from
the
booth
for
i
knew
that
that
was
his
purpose
craig
glanced
at
haddon
who
now
seemed
absorbed
in
talking
to
carton
no
one
he
answered
quickly
central
told
me
there
had
not
been
a
call
from
this
for
half
an
hour
no
one
i
echoed
almost
incredulously
then
what
did
he
do
something
happened
all
right
kennedy
was
evidently
engrossed
in
his
own
thoughts
for
he
said
nothing
haddon
says
he
wants
to
do
some
scouting
about
announced
carton
when
we
rejoined
them
there
are
several
people
whom
he
says
he
might
suspect
i
arranged
to
meet
him
this
afternoon
to
get
the
first
part
of
this
story
about
the
inside
working
of
the
vice
trust
and
he
will
let
me
know
if
anything
develops
then
you
will
be
at
your
office
yes
one
or
the
other
of
us
returned
craig
in
a
tone
which
haddon
could
not
hear
in
the
meantime
we
took
occasion
to
make
some
inquiries
of
our
own
about
haddon
and
loraine
keith
they
were
evidently
well
known
in
the
select
circle
in
which
they
travelled
haddon
had
many
curious
characteristics
chief
of
which
to
interest
kennedy
was
his
speed
mania
time
and
again
he
had
been
arrested
for
exceeding
the
speed
limit
in
taxicabs
and
in
a
car
of
his
own
often
in
the
past
with
loraine
keith
but
lately
alone
it
was
toward
the
close
of
the
afternoon
that
carton
called
up
hurriedly
as
kennedy
hung
up
the
receiver
i
read
on
his
face
that
something
had
gone
wrong
haddon
has
disappeared
he
announced
mysteriously
and
suddenly
without
leaving
so
much
as
a
clue
it
seems
that
he
found
in
his
office
a
package
exactly
like
that
which
was
sent
to
carton
earlier
in
the
day
he
did
wait
to
say
anything
about
it
but
left
carton
is
bringing
it
over
here
perhaps
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
carton
himself
deposited
the
package
on
the
laboratory
table
with
an
air
of
relief
we
looked
eagerly
it
was
addressed
to
haddon
at
the
mayfair
in
the
same
disguised
handwriting
and
was
done
up
in
precisely
the
same
fashion
lots
of
bombs
are
just
scare
bombs
observed
craig
but
you
never
can
tell
again
kennedy
had
started
to
dissect
ah
he
went
on
this
is
the
real
thing
though
only
a
little
different
from
the
other
a
dry
battery
gives
a
spark
when
the
lid
is
slipped
back
see
the
explosive
is
in
a
steel
pipe
sliding
the
lid
off
is
supposed
to
explode
it
why
there
is
enough
explosive
in
this
to
have
silenced
a
dozen
haddons
do
you
think
he
could
have
been
kidnapped
or
murdered
i
asked
what
is
this
anyhow
or
perhaps
bribed
suggested
carton
i
ca
say
ruminated
kennedy
but
i
can
say
this
that
there
is
at
large
in
this
city
a
man
of
great
mechanical
skill
and
practical
knowledge
of
electricity
and
explosives
he
is
trying
to
make
sure
of
hiding
something
from
exposure
we
must
find
him
and
especially
haddon
carton
added
quickly
he
is
the
missing
link
his
testimony
is
absolutely
essential
to
the
case
i
am
building
up
i
think
i
shall
want
to
observe
loraine
keith
without
being
observed
planned
kennedy
with
a
hasty
glance
at
his
watch
i
think
i
drop
around
at
this
mayfair
i
have
heard
so
much
about
will
you
come
i
better
not
refused
carton
you
know
they
all
know
me
and
everything
quits
wherever
i
go
i
see
you
soon
as
we
drove
in
a
cab
over
to
the
mayfair
kennedy
said
nothing
i
wondered
how
and
where
haddon
had
disappeared
had
the
powers
of
evil
in
the
city
learned
that
he
was
weakening
and
hurried
him
out
of
the
way
at
the
last
moment
just
what
had
loraine
keith
to
do
with
it
was
she
in
any
way
responsible
i
felt
that
there
were
indeed
no
bounds
to
what
a
jealous
woman
might
dare
beside
the
ornate
grilled
doorway
of
the
carriage
entrance
of
the
mayfair
stood
a
easel
with
the
words
tango
tea
at
four
although
it
was
considerably
after
that
time
there
was
a
line
of
before
the
place
and
inside
a
brave
array
of
and
revellers
the
public
dancing
had
ceased
and
a
cabaret
had
taken
its
place
we
entered
and
sat
down
at
one
of
the
more
inconspicuous
of
the
little
round
tables
on
a
stage
at
one
side
a
girl
was
singing
one
of
the
latest
syncopated
airs
we
just
stick
around
a
while
walter
whispered
craig
perhaps
this
loraine
keith
will
come
in
behind
us
protected
both
by
the
music
and
the
rustle
of
people
coming
and
going
a
couple
talked
in
low
tones
now
and
then
a
word
floated
over
to
me
in
a
language
which
was
english
sure
enough
but
not
of
a
kind
that
i
could
understand
dropped
by
a
flatty
i
caught
once
then
something
about
a
mouthpiece
and
the
bulls
and
making
a
plant
a
dip
pickpocket
and
his
girl
or
as
they
call
them
translated
kennedy
one
of
their
number
has
evidently
been
picked
up
by
a
detective
and
he
looks
to
them
for
a
good
lawyer
or
besides
these
two
there
were
innumerable
other
interesting
glimpses
into
the
life
of
this
for
the
underworlds
a
motion
in
the
audience
attracted
me
as
if
some
favourite
performer
were
about
to
appear
and
i
heard
the
whisper
loraine
keith
there
she
was
a
petite
girl
chic
well
groomed
and
gowned
so
daringly
that
every
woman
in
the
audience
envied
and
every
man
craned
his
neck
to
see
her
better
loraine
wore
a
black
dress
slashed
to
the
knee
in
fact
everything
was
calculated
to
set
her
off
at
best
advantage
and
on
the
stage
at
least
there
was
something
recherche
about
her
yet
there
was
also
something
gross
about
her
too
accompanying
her
was
a
fellow
whose
face
was
particularly
unattractive
it
seemed
as
if
the
bone
in
his
nose
was
going
due
to
the
shrinkage
of
the
once
just
before
the
dance
began
i
saw
him
rub
something
on
the
back
of
his
hand
raise
it
to
his
nose
and
sniff
then
he
took
a
sip
of
a
liqueur
the
dance
began
wild
from
the
first
step
and
as
it
developed
kennedy
leaned
over
and
whispered
the
danse
des
apaches
it
was
acrobatic
the
man
expressed
brutish
passion
and
jealousy
the
woman
affection
and
fear
it
seemed
to
tell
a
story
the
struggle
of
love
the
love
of
the
woman
against
the
brutal
instincts
of
the
thug
her
lover
she
was
terrified
as
well
as
fascinated
by
him
in
his
mad
temper
and
tremendous
superhuman
strength
i
wondered
if
the
dance
portrayed
the
fact
the
music
was
a
popular
air
with
many
rapid
changes
but
through
all
there
was
a
constant
rhythm
which
accorded
well
with
the
abandon
of
the
swaying
dance
indeed
i
could
think
of
nothing
so
much
as
of
bill
sykes
and
nancy
as
i
watched
these
two
it
was
the
fight
of
two
frenzied
young
animals
he
would
approach
stealthily
seize
her
and
whirl
her
about
lifting
her
to
his
shoulder
she
was
agile
docile
and
fearful
he
untied
a
scarf
and
passed
it
about
her
she
leaned
against
it
and
they
whirled
giddily
about
suddenly
it
seemed
that
he
became
jealous
she
would
run
he
follow
and
catch
her
she
would
try
to
pacify
him
he
would
become
more
enraged
the
dance
became
faster
and
more
furious
his
violent
efforts
seemed
to
be
to
throw
her
to
the
floor
and
her
streaming
hair
now
made
it
seem
more
like
a
fight
than
a
dance
the
audience
hung
breathless
it
ended
with
her
dropping
exhausted
a
proper
finale
to
this
lowest
and
most
brutal
dance
panting
flushed
with
an
unnatural
light
in
their
eyes
they
descended
to
the
audience
and
scorning
the
roar
of
applause
to
repeat
the
performance
sat
at
a
little
table
i
saw
a
couple
of
girls
come
over
toward
the
man
give
us
a
deck
coke
said
one
in
a
harsh
voice
he
nodded
a
silver
quarter
gleamed
momentarily
from
hand
to
hand
and
he
passed
to
one
girl
stealthily
a
small
packet
others
came
to
him
both
men
and
women
it
seemed
to
be
an
established
thing
who
is
that
asked
kennedy
in
a
low
tone
of
the
pickpocket
back
of
us
coke
brodie
was
the
laconic
reply
a
cocaine
fiend
yes
and
a
lobbygow
for
the
grapevine
system
of
selling
the
dope
under
this
new
law
where
does
he
get
the
supply
to
sell
asked
kennedy
casually
the
pickpocket
shrugged
his
shoulders
no
one
knows
i
suppose
kennedy
commented
to
me
but
he
gets
it
in
spite
of
the
added
restrictions
and
peddles
it
in
little
packets
adulterated
and
at
a
fabulous
price
for
such
cheap
stuff
the
habit
is
spreading
like
wildfire
it
is
a
fertile
means
of
recruiting
the
inmates
in
the
hotels
a
veritable
epidemic
it
is
too
cocaine
is
one
of
the
most
harmful
of
all
drugs
it
used
to
be
a
habit
of
the
underworld
but
now
it
is
creeping
up
and
gradually
and
surely
reaching
the
higher
strata
of
society
one
thing
that
causes
its
spread
is
the
ease
with
which
it
can
be
taken
it
requires
no
no
syringe
no
paraphernalia
only
the
drug
itself
another
singer
had
taken
the
place
of
the
dancers
kennedy
leaned
over
and
whispered
to
the
dip
say
do
you
and
your
want
to
pick
up
a
piece
of
change
to
get
that
mouthpiece
i
heard
you
talking
about
the
pickpocket
looked
at
craig
suspiciously
oh
do
worry
i
all
right
laughed
craig
you
see
that
fellow
coke
brodie
i
want
to
get
something
on
him
if
you
will
frame
that
sucker
to
get
away
with
a
whole
front
there
a
fifty
in
it
the
dip
looked
rather
than
spoke
his
amazement
apparently
kennedy
satisfied
his
suspicions
i
on
he
said
quickly
when
he
goes
i
follow
him
you
keep
behind
us
and
we
deliver
the
goods
what
it
all
about
i
whispered
why
he
answered
i
want
to
get
brodie
only
i
do
want
to
figure
in
the
thing
so
that
he
will
know
me
or
suspect
anything
but
a
plain
they
will
get
him
take
everything
he
has
there
must
be
something
on
that
man
that
will
help
us
several
performers
had
done
their
turns
and
the
supply
of
the
drug
seemed
to
have
been
exhausted
brodie
rose
and
with
a
nod
to
loraine
went
out
unsteadily
now
that
the
effect
of
the
cocaine
had
worn
off
one
wondered
how
this
shuffling
person
could
ever
have
carried
through
the
wild
dance
it
was
not
brodie
who
danced
it
was
the
drug
the
dip
slipped
out
after
him
followed
by
the
woman
we
rose
and
followed
also
across
the
city
brodie
slouched
his
way
with
an
evident
purpose
it
seemed
of
replenishing
his
supply
and
continuing
his
round
of
peddling
the
stuff
he
stopped
under
the
brow
of
a
thickly
populated
tenement
row
on
the
upper
east
side
as
though
this
was
his
destination
there
he
stood
at
the
gate
that
led
down
to
a
cellar
looking
up
and
down
as
if
wondering
whether
he
was
observed
we
had
slunk
into
a
doorway
a
woman
coming
down
the
street
swinging
a
chatelaine
walked
close
to
him
spoke
and
for
a
moment
they
talked
it
the
remarked
kennedy
she
getting
brodie
off
his
guard
this
must
be
the
root
of
that
grapevine
system
as
they
call
it
suddenly
from
the
shadow
of
the
next
house
a
stealthy
figure
sprang
out
on
brodie
it
was
our
dip
a
dip
no
longer
but
a
regular
man
with
a
gun
jammed
into
the
face
of
his
victim
and
a
broad
hand
over
his
mouth
skilfully
the
woman
went
through
brodie
pockets
her
nimble
fingers
missing
not
a
thing
now
beat
it
we
heard
the
dip
whisper
hoarsely
and
if
you
raise
a
holler
we
get
you
right
next
time
brodie
fled
as
fast
as
his
weakened
nerves
would
permit
his
shaky
limbs
to
move
as
he
disappeared
the
dip
sent
something
dark
hurtling
over
the
roof
of
the
house
across
the
street
and
hurried
toward
us
what
was
that
i
asked
i
think
it
was
the
pistol
on
the
end
of
a
stout
cord
that
is
a
favourite
trick
of
the
gunmen
after
a
job
it
destroys
at
least
a
part
of
the
evidence
you
ca
throw
a
gun
very
far
alone
you
know
but
with
it
at
the
end
of
a
string
you
can
lift
it
up
over
the
roof
of
a
tenement
if
brodie
squeals
to
a
copper
and
these
people
are
caught
they
ca
hold
them
under
the
pistol
law
anyhow
the
dip
had
caught
sight
of
us
with
his
ferret
eyes
in
the
doorway
quickly
kennedy
passed
over
the
money
in
return
for
the
motley
array
of
objects
taken
from
brodie
the
dip
and
his
disappeared
into
the
darkness
as
quickly
as
they
had
emerged
there
was
a
curious
assortment
the
paraphernalia
of
a
drug
fiend
old
letters
a
key
and
several
other
useless
articles
the
pickpocket
had
retained
the
money
from
the
sale
of
the
dope
as
his
own
particular
honorarium
brodie
has
led
us
up
to
the
source
of
his
supply
remarked
kennedy
thoughtfully
regarding
the
stuff
and
the
dip
has
given
us
the
key
to
it
are
you
game
to
go
in
a
glance
up
and
down
the
street
showed
it
still
deserted
we
wormed
our
way
in
the
shadow
to
the
cellar
before
which
brodie
had
stood
the
outside
door
was
open
we
entered
and
craig
stealthily
struck
a
match
shading
it
in
his
hands
at
one
end
we
were
confronted
by
a
little
door
of
mystery
barred
with
iron
and
held
by
an
innocent
enough
looking
padlock
it
was
this
lock
evidently
to
which
the
key
fitted
opening
the
way
into
the
subterranean
vault
of
brick
and
stone
kennedy
opened
it
and
pushed
back
the
door
there
was
a
little
square
compartment
dark
as
pitch
and
delightfully
cool
and
damp
he
lighted
a
match
then
hastily
blew
it
out
and
switched
on
an
electric
bulb
which
it
disclosed
ca
afford
risks
like
that
here
he
exclaimed
carefully
disposing
of
the
match
as
our
eyes
became
accustomed
to
the
light
on
every
side
were
pieces
of
boxes
and
paper
and
on
shelves
were
jars
of
various
materials
there
was
a
littered
with
tools
pieces
of
wire
boxes
and
scraps
of
metal
my
word
exclaimed
kennedy
as
he
surveyed
the
curious
scene
before
us
this
is
a
regular
bomb
factory
one
of
the
most
amazing
exhibits
that
the
history
of
crime
has
ever
produced
xviii
the
coke
fiend
i
followed
him
in
awe
as
he
made
a
hasty
inventory
of
what
we
had
discovered
there
were
as
many
as
a
dozen
finished
and
partly
finished
infernal
machines
of
various
sizes
and
kinds
some
of
tremendous
destructive
capacity
kennedy
did
not
even
attempt
to
study
them
all
about
were
high
explosives
chemicals
dynamite
there
was
gunpowder
of
all
varieties
antimony
mercury
cyanide
chloral
hydrate
chlorate
of
potash
samples
of
various
kinds
of
shot
some
of
the
outlawed
dumdum
bullets
cartridges
shells
pieces
of
metal
purposely
left
with
jagged
edges
platinum
aluminum
iron
steel
a
conglomerate
mass
of
stuff
that
would
have
gladdened
an
anarchist
kennedy
was
examining
a
little
electric
furnace
which
was
evidently
used
for
heating
soldering
irons
and
other
tools
everything
had
been
done
it
seemed
to
prevent
explosions
there
were
no
open
lights
and
practically
no
chance
for
heat
to
be
communicated
far
among
the
explosives
indeed
everything
had
been
arranged
to
protect
the
operator
himself
in
his
diabolical
work
kennedy
had
switched
on
the
electric
furnace
and
from
the
various
pieces
of
metal
on
the
table
selected
several
these
he
was
placing
together
in
a
peculiar
manner
and
to
them
he
attached
some
copper
wire
which
lay
in
a
corner
in
a
roll
under
the
beneath
the
furnace
one
could
feel
the
warmth
of
the
thing
slightly
quickly
he
took
the
curious
affair
which
he
had
hastily
shaped
and
fastened
it
under
the
table
at
that
point
then
led
the
wires
out
through
a
little
barred
window
to
an
the
only
means
of
ventilation
of
the
place
except
the
door
while
he
was
working
i
had
been
gingerly
inspecting
the
rest
of
the
den
in
a
corner
just
beside
the
door
i
had
found
a
set
of
shelves
and
a
cabinet
on
both
were
innumerable
packets
done
up
in
white
paper
i
opened
one
and
found
it
contained
several
pinches
of
a
white
crystalline
substance
little
portions
of
cocaine
commented
kennedy
when
i
showed
him
what
i
had
found
in
the
slang
of
the
fiends
on
the
top
of
the
cabinet
he
discovered
a
little
enamelled
box
much
like
a
in
which
were
also
some
of
the
white
flakes
quickly
he
emptied
them
out
and
replaced
them
with
others
from
jars
which
had
not
been
made
up
into
packets
why
there
must
be
hundreds
of
ounces
of
the
stuff
here
to
say
nothing
of
the
various
things
they
adulterate
it
with
remarked
kennedy
no
wonder
they
are
so
careful
when
it
is
a
felony
even
to
have
it
in
your
possession
in
such
quantities
see
how
careful
they
are
about
the
adulteration
too
you
could
never
tell
except
from
the
effect
whether
it
was
the
pure
or
only
a
article
kennedy
took
a
last
look
at
the
den
to
make
sure
that
nothing
had
been
disturbed
that
would
arouse
suspicion
we
may
as
well
go
he
remarked
i
want
to
be
free
to
make
the
connection
outside
with
that
wire
in
the
shaft
imagine
our
surprise
the
next
morning
when
a
tap
at
our
door
revealed
loraine
keith
herself
is
this
professor
kennedy
she
asked
gazing
at
us
with
a
expression
which
she
was
making
a
tremendous
effort
to
control
because
if
it
is
i
have
something
to
tell
him
that
may
interest
mr
carton
we
looked
at
her
curiously
without
her
she
was
pallid
and
yellow
in
spots
her
hands
trembling
cold
and
sweaty
her
eyes
sunken
and
glistening
with
pupils
dilated
her
breathing
short
and
hurried
restless
irresolute
and
careless
of
her
personal
appearance
perhaps
you
wonder
how
i
heard
of
you
and
why
i
have
come
to
you
she
went
on
it
is
because
i
have
a
confession
to
make
i
saw
haddon
just
before
he
was
kidnapped
she
seemed
to
hesitate
over
the
word
how
did
you
know
i
was
interested
asked
kennedy
keenly
i
heard
him
mention
your
name
with
mr
carton
then
he
knew
that
i
was
more
than
a
reporter
for
the
star
remarked
kennedy
kidnapped
you
say
how
she
shot
a
glance
half
of
suspicion
half
of
frankness
at
us
that
what
i
must
confess
whoever
did
it
must
have
used
me
as
a
tool
haddon
and
i
used
to
be
good
friends
i
would
be
yet
there
was
evident
feeling
in
her
tone
which
she
did
not
have
to
assume
all
i
remember
yesterday
was
that
after
lunch
i
was
in
the
office
of
the
mayfair
when
he
came
in
on
his
desk
was
a
package
i
do
know
what
has
become
of
it
but
he
gave
one
look
at
it
seemed
to
turn
pale
then
caught
sight
of
me
he
whispered
used
to
be
good
friends
forgive
me
for
turning
you
down
but
you
do
understand
get
me
away
from
here
come
with
me
call
a
cab
well
i
got
into
the
cab
with
him
we
had
a
chauffeur
whom
we
used
to
have
in
the
old
days
we
drove
furiously
avoiding
the
traffic
men
he
told
the
driver
to
take
us
to
my
apartment
and
and
that
is
the
last
i
remember
except
a
scuffle
in
which
i
was
dragged
from
the
cab
on
one
side
and
he
on
the
other
she
had
opened
her
handbag
and
taken
from
it
a
little
like
that
which
we
had
seen
in
the
den
i
i
ca
go
on
she
apologised
without
this
stuff
so
you
are
a
cocaine
fiend
also
remarked
kennedy
yes
i
ca
help
it
there
is
an
indescribable
excitement
to
do
something
great
to
make
a
mark
that
goes
with
it
it
soon
gone
but
while
it
lasts
i
can
sing
and
dance
do
anything
until
every
part
of
my
body
begins
crying
for
it
again
i
was
full
of
the
stuff
when
this
happened
yesterday
had
taken
too
much
i
guess
the
change
in
her
after
she
had
snuffed
some
of
the
crystals
was
magical
from
a
quivering
wretch
she
had
become
now
a
neurasthenic
you
know
where
that
stuff
will
land
you
i
presume
questioned
kennedy
i
do
care
she
laughed
hollowly
yes
i
know
what
you
are
going
to
tell
me
soon
i
be
hunting
for
the
cocaine
bug
as
they
call
it
imagining
that
in
my
skin
under
the
flesh
are
worms
crawling
perhaps
see
them
see
the
little
animals
running
around
and
biting
me
oh
you
do
know
there
are
two
souls
to
the
cocainist
one
is
tortured
by
the
suffering
which
the
stuff
brings
the
other
laughs
at
the
fears
and
pains
but
it
brings
such
thoughts
it
stimulates
my
mind
makes
it
work
without
against
my
will
gives
me
such
visions
oh
i
can
not
go
on
they
would
kill
me
if
they
knew
i
had
come
to
you
why
have
i
has
not
haddon
cast
me
off
what
is
he
to
me
now
it
was
evident
that
she
was
growing
hysterical
i
wondered
whether
after
all
the
story
of
the
kidnapping
of
haddon
might
not
be
a
figment
of
her
brain
simply
an
hallucination
due
to
the
drug
they
inquired
kennedy
observing
her
narrowly
who
i
ca
tell
i
do
know
why
did
i
come
why
did
i
come
she
was
reaching
again
for
the
but
kennedy
restrained
her
miss
keith
he
remarked
you
are
concealing
something
from
me
there
is
some
one
he
paused
a
moment
whom
you
are
shielding
no
no
she
cried
he
was
taken
brodie
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
nothing
that
is
what
you
mean
i
know
this
stuff
increases
my
sensitiveness
yet
i
hate
coke
brodie
oh
let
me
go
i
am
all
unstrung
let
me
see
a
doctor
when
i
am
better
i
will
tell
all
loraine
keith
had
torn
herself
from
him
had
instantly
taken
a
pinch
of
the
fatal
crystals
with
that
same
ominous
change
from
fear
to
what
had
been
her
purpose
in
coming
at
all
it
had
seemed
at
first
to
implicate
brodie
but
she
had
been
quick
to
shield
him
when
she
saw
that
danger
i
wondered
what
the
fascination
might
be
which
the
wretch
exercised
over
her
i
will
see
you
she
cried
and
a
moment
later
she
was
gone
as
unexpectedly
as
she
had
come
i
looked
at
kennedy
blankly
what
was
the
purpose
of
that
outburst
i
asked
i
ca
say
he
replied
it
was
all
so
incoherent
that
from
what
i
know
of
drug
fiends
i
am
sure
she
had
a
purpose
in
it
all
it
does
not
change
my
plans
two
hours
later
we
had
paid
a
deposit
on
an
empty
flat
in
the
in
which
the
had
his
headquarters
and
had
received
a
key
to
the
apartment
from
the
janitor
after
considerable
difficulty
owing
to
the
narrowness
of
the
kennedy
managed
to
pick
up
the
loose
ends
of
the
wire
which
had
been
led
out
of
the
little
window
at
the
base
of
the
shaft
and
had
attached
it
to
a
couple
of
curious
arrangements
which
he
had
brought
with
him
one
looked
like
a
large
taximeter
from
a
motor
cab
the
other
was
a
diminutive
in
looks
at
least
attached
to
them
were
several
bells
and
lights
he
had
scarcely
completed
installing
the
thing
whatever
it
was
when
a
gentle
tap
at
the
door
startled
me
kennedy
nodded
and
i
opened
it
it
was
carton
i
have
had
my
men
watching
the
mayfair
he
announced
there
seems
to
be
a
general
feeling
of
alarm
there
now
they
ca
even
find
loraine
keith
brodie
apparently
has
not
shown
up
in
his
usual
haunts
since
the
episode
of
last
night
i
wonder
if
the
long
arm
of
this
vice
trust
could
have
reached
out
and
gathered
them
in
too
i
asked
quite
likely
replied
carton
absorbed
in
watching
kennedy
this
a
little
bell
had
tinkled
sharply
and
a
light
had
flashed
up
on
the
attachments
to
the
apparatus
nothing
i
was
just
testing
it
to
see
if
it
works
it
does
although
the
end
which
i
installed
down
below
was
necessarily
only
a
makeshift
it
is
not
this
red
light
with
the
shrill
bell
that
we
are
interested
in
it
is
the
green
light
and
the
bell
this
is
a
thermopile
and
what
is
a
thermopile
queried
carton
for
the
sake
of
one
who
has
forgotten
his
physics
smiled
kennedy
i
may
say
this
is
only
another
illustration
of
how
all
science
ultimately
finds
practical
application
you
probably
have
forgotten
that
when
two
of
dissimilar
metals
are
joined
together
and
one
is
suddenly
heated
or
chilled
there
is
produced
at
the
opposite
connecting
point
a
feeble
current
which
will
flow
until
the
junctures
are
both
at
the
same
temperature
you
might
call
this
a
thermometer
or
a
telethermometer
or
a
microthermometer
or
any
of
a
dozen
names
yes
i
agreed
mechanically
only
vaguely
guessing
at
what
he
had
in
mind
the
accurate
measurement
of
temperature
is
still
a
problem
of
considerable
difficulty
he
resumed
adjusting
the
thermometer
a
heated
mass
can
impart
vibratory
motion
to
the
ether
which
fills
space
and
the
of
ether
are
able
to
reproduce
in
other
bodies
motions
similar
to
those
by
which
they
are
caused
at
this
end
of
the
line
i
merely
measure
the
electromotive
force
developed
by
the
difference
in
temperature
of
two
similar
junctions
opposed
we
call
those
junctions
in
a
thermopile
and
by
getting
the
recording
instruments
sensitive
enough
we
can
measure
one
of
a
degree
becquerel
was
the
first
i
believe
to
use
this
property
but
the
machine
which
you
see
here
was
one
recently
invented
for
registering
the
temperature
of
sea
water
so
as
to
detect
the
approach
of
an
iceberg
i
saw
no
reason
why
it
should
not
be
used
to
measure
heat
as
well
as
cold
you
see
down
there
i
placed
the
couples
of
the
thermopile
beneath
the
electric
furnace
on
the
table
here
i
have
the
mechanism
operated
by
the
feeble
current
from
the
thermopile
opening
and
closing
switches
and
actuating
bells
and
lights
then
too
i
have
the
recording
instrument
the
thing
is
fundamentally
very
simple
and
is
based
on
phenomena
it
is
not
uncertain
and
can
be
tested
at
any
time
just
as
i
did
then
when
i
showed
a
slight
fall
in
temperature
of
course
it
is
not
the
slight
changes
i
am
after
not
the
gradual
but
the
sudden
changes
in
temperature
i
see
said
carton
if
there
is
a
drop
the
current
goes
one
way
and
we
see
the
red
light
a
rise
and
it
goes
the
other
and
we
see
a
green
light
exactly
agreed
kennedy
no
one
is
going
to
approach
that
chamber
as
long
as
he
thinks
any
one
is
watching
and
we
do
not
know
where
they
are
watching
but
the
moment
any
sudden
great
change
is
registered
such
as
turning
on
that
electric
furnace
we
shall
know
it
here
it
must
have
been
an
hour
that
we
sat
there
discussing
the
merits
of
the
case
and
speculating
on
the
strange
actions
of
loraine
keith
suddenly
the
red
light
flashed
out
brilliantly
what
that
asked
carton
quickly
i
ca
tell
yet
remarked
kennedy
perhaps
it
is
nothing
at
all
perhaps
it
is
a
draught
of
cold
air
from
opening
the
door
we
shall
have
to
wait
and
see
we
bent
over
the
little
machine
straining
our
eyes
and
ears
to
catch
the
visual
and
audible
signals
which
it
gave
gradually
the
light
faded
as
the
thermopile
adjusted
itself
to
the
change
in
temperature
suddenly
without
warning
a
bell
rang
before
us
and
a
light
flashed
up
that
can
have
only
one
meaning
cried
craig
excitedly
some
one
is
down
there
in
that
inferno
perhaps
the
himself
the
bell
continued
to
ring
and
the
light
to
glow
showing
that
whoever
was
there
had
actually
started
the
electric
furnace
what
was
he
preparing
to
do
i
felt
that
even
though
we
knew
there
was
some
one
there
it
did
us
little
good
i
for
one
had
no
relish
for
the
job
of
bearding
such
a
lion
in
his
den
we
looked
at
kennedy
wondering
what
he
would
do
next
from
the
package
in
which
he
had
brought
the
two
registering
machines
he
quietly
took
another
package
wrapped
up
about
eighteen
inches
long
and
apparently
very
heavy
as
he
did
so
he
kept
his
attention
fixed
on
the
telethermometer
was
he
going
to
wait
until
the
had
finished
what
he
had
come
to
accomplish
it
was
perhaps
fifteen
minutes
after
our
first
alarm
that
the
signals
began
to
weaken
does
that
mean
that
he
has
gone
escaped
inquired
carton
anxiously
no
it
means
that
his
furnace
is
going
at
full
power
and
that
he
has
forgotten
it
it
is
what
i
am
waiting
for
come
on
seizing
the
package
as
he
hurried
from
the
room
kennedy
dashed
out
on
the
street
and
down
the
outside
cellar
stairs
followed
by
us
he
paused
at
the
thick
door
and
listened
apparently
there
was
not
a
sound
from
the
other
side
except
a
whir
of
a
motor
and
a
roar
which
might
have
been
from
the
furnace
softly
he
tried
the
door
it
was
locked
on
the
inside
was
the
there
still
he
must
be
suppose
he
heard
us
would
he
hesitate
a
moment
to
send
us
all
to
perdition
along
with
himself
how
were
we
to
get
past
that
door
really
the
deathlike
stillness
on
the
other
side
was
more
mysterious
than
would
have
been
the
detonation
of
some
of
the
criminal
explosive
kennedy
had
evidently
satisfied
himself
on
one
point
if
we
were
to
get
into
that
chamber
we
must
do
it
ourselves
and
we
must
do
it
quickly
from
the
package
which
he
carried
he
pulled
out
a
stubby
little
cylinder
perhaps
eighteen
inches
long
very
heavy
with
a
short
stump
of
a
lever
projecting
from
one
side
between
the
stonework
of
a
chimney
and
the
barred
door
he
laid
it
horizontally
jamming
in
some
pieces
of
wood
to
wedge
it
tighter
then
he
began
to
pump
on
the
handle
vigorously
the
almost
impregnable
door
seemed
slowly
to
bulge
still
there
was
no
sign
of
life
from
within
had
the
left
before
we
arrived
this
is
my
scientific
panted
kennedy
as
he
worked
the
little
lever
backward
and
forward
more
quickly
a
hydraulic
ram
there
is
no
swinging
of
axes
or
wielding
of
crowbars
necessary
in
breaking
down
an
obstruction
like
this
nowadays
such
things
are
obsolete
this
little
jimmy
if
you
want
to
call
it
that
has
a
power
of
ten
tons
that
ought
to
be
enough
it
seemed
as
if
the
door
were
slowly
being
crushed
in
before
the
irresistible
punch
of
the
hydraulic
ram
kennedy
stopped
evidently
he
did
not
dare
to
crush
the
door
in
altogether
quickly
he
released
the
ram
and
placed
it
vertically
under
the
door
jamb
he
inserted
a
powerful
claw
of
the
ram
and
again
he
began
to
work
the
handle
a
moment
later
the
powerful
door
buckled
and
kennedy
deftly
swung
it
outward
so
that
it
fell
with
a
crash
on
the
cellar
floor
as
the
noise
reverberated
there
came
a
sound
of
a
muttered
curse
from
the
cavern
some
one
was
there
we
pressed
forward
on
the
floor
in
the
weird
glare
of
the
little
furnace
lay
a
man
and
a
woman
the
light
playing
over
their
ghastly
set
features
kennedy
knelt
over
the
man
who
was
nearest
the
door
call
a
doctor
quick
he
ordered
reaching
over
and
feeling
the
pulse
of
the
woman
who
had
half
fallen
out
of
her
chair
they
will
be
all
right
soon
they
took
what
they
thought
was
their
usual
adulterated
cocaine
see
here
is
the
box
in
which
it
was
instead
i
filled
the
box
with
the
pure
drug
they
come
around
besides
carton
needs
both
of
them
in
his
fight
do
take
any
more
muttered
the
woman
half
conscious
something
wrong
with
it
haddon
i
looked
more
closely
at
the
face
in
the
it
was
haddon
himself
i
knew
he
come
back
when
the
craving
for
the
drug
became
intense
enough
remarked
kennedy
carton
looked
at
kennedy
in
amazement
haddon
was
the
last
person
in
the
world
whom
he
had
evidently
expected
to
discover
here
how
what
do
you
mean
the
episode
of
the
telephone
booth
gave
me
the
first
hint
that
is
the
favourite
stunt
of
the
drug
fiend
a
few
minutes
alone
and
he
thinks
no
one
is
the
wiser
about
his
habit
then
too
there
was
the
story
about
his
speed
mania
that
is
a
frequent
failing
of
the
cocainist
the
drug
too
was
killing
his
interest
in
loraine
keith
that
is
the
last
stage
yet
under
its
influence
just
as
with
his
lobbygow
and
lieutenant
brodie
he
found
power
and
inspiration
with
him
it
took
the
form
of
bombs
to
protect
himself
in
his
graft
he
ca
escape
this
time
loraine
we
leave
it
at
his
house
you
know
carton
we
looked
quickly
at
the
on
it
was
a
gigantic
bomb
of
clockwork
over
which
haddon
had
been
working
the
cocaine
which
was
to
have
given
him
inspiration
had
thanks
to
kennedy
overcome
him
beside
loraine
keith
were
a
and
a
gladstone
she
had
evidently
been
stuffing
the
corners
full
of
their
favourite
nepenthe
for
as
kennedy
reached
down
and
turned
over
the
closely
packed
finery
and
the
few
articles
belonging
to
haddon
innumerable
packets
from
the
cabinet
dropped
out
hulloa
what
this
he
exclaimed
as
he
came
to
a
huge
roll
of
bills
and
a
mass
of
silver
and
gold
coin
trying
to
us
all
the
time
that
was
her
clever
game
to
give
him
the
hours
he
needed
to
gather
what
money
he
could
save
and
make
a
clean
getaway
even
cocaine
does
destroy
the
interest
of
men
and
women
in
that
he
concluded
turning
over
to
carton
the
wealth
which
haddon
had
amassed
as
one
of
the
meanest
grafters
of
the
city
of
graft
here
was
a
case
which
i
could
not
help
letting
the
star
have
immediately
notes
or
no
notes
it
was
local
news
of
the
first
order
besides
anything
that
concerned
carton
was
of
the
highest
political
significance
it
kept
me
late
at
the
office
and
i
overslept
consequently
i
did
not
see
much
of
craig
the
next
morning
especially
as
he
told
me
he
had
nothing
special
having
turned
down
a
case
of
a
robbery
of
a
safe
on
the
ground
that
the
police
were
much
better
fitted
to
catch
ordinary
yeggmen
than
he
was
during
the
day
therefore
i
helped
in
directing
the
following
up
of
the
haddon
case
for
the
star
then
suddenly
a
new
front
page
story
crowded
this
one
of
the
main
headlines
with
a
sigh
of
relief
i
glanced
at
the
new
thriller
found
it
had
something
to
do
with
the
navy
department
and
that
it
came
from
as
far
away
as
washington
there
was
no
reason
now
why
others
could
not
carry
on
the
graft
story
and
i
left
not
unwillingly
my
special
work
just
now
was
keeping
on
the
trail
of
kennedy
and
i
was
glad
to
go
back
to
the
apartment
and
wait
for
him
i
suppose
you
saw
that
despatch
from
washington
in
this
papers
he
queried
as
he
came
in
tossing
a
late
edition
of
the
record
down
on
my
desk
across
the
front
page
extended
a
huge
black
navy
most
vital
secret
stolen
yes
i
shrugged
but
you
ca
get
me
much
excited
by
what
the
rewrite
men
on
the
record
say
why
he
asked
going
directly
into
his
own
room
well
i
replied
glancing
through
the
text
of
the
story
the
actual
facts
are
practically
the
same
as
in
the
other
papers
take
this
for
instance
the
night
of
the
celebration
of
the
anniversary
of
the
battle
of
manila
there
were
stolen
from
the
navy
department
plans
which
the
record
learns
exclusively
represent
the
greatest
naval
secret
in
the
world
so
much
for
that
paragraph
written
in
the
office
then
it
goes
on
the
whole
machinery
of
the
government
has
been
put
in
operation
no
one
has
been
able
to
extract
from
the
authorities
the
exact
secret
which
was
stolen
but
it
is
believed
to
be
an
invention
which
will
revolutionise
the
structure
and
construction
of
the
most
modern
monster
battleships
such
knowledge
it
is
said
in
the
hands
of
experts
might
prove
fatal
in
almost
any
fight
in
which
our
newer
ships
met
others
of
about
equal
fighting
power
as
with
it
marksmen
might
direct
a
shot
that
would
disable
our
ships
it
is
the
opinion
of
the
experts
that
the
theft
was
executed
by
a
skilled
draughtsman
or
other
civilian
employe
at
any
rate
the
thief
knew
what
to
take
and
its
value
there
is
at
least
one
nation
it
is
asserted
which
faces
the
problem
of
bringing
its
ships
up
to
the
standard
of
our
own
to
which
the
plans
would
be
very
valuable
the
building
had
been
thrown
open
to
the
public
for
the
display
of
fireworks
on
the
monument
grounds
before
it
the
plans
are
said
to
have
been
on
one
of
the
drawn
upon
linen
to
be
made
into
they
are
known
to
have
been
on
the
tables
when
the
was
locked
for
the
night
the
room
is
on
the
third
floor
of
the
department
and
has
a
balcony
looking
out
on
the
monument
many
officers
and
officials
had
their
families
and
friends
on
the
balcony
to
witness
the
celebration
though
it
is
not
known
that
any
one
was
in
the
itself
all
were
admitted
to
the
building
on
passes
the
plans
were
tacked
to
a
in
the
room
but
when
it
was
opened
in
the
morning
the
linen
sheet
was
gone
and
so
were
the
the
plans
could
readily
have
been
rolled
into
a
small
bundle
and
carried
under
a
coat
or
wrap
while
the
authorities
are
trying
to
minimise
the
actual
loss
it
is
believed
that
this
position
is
only
an
attempt
to
allay
the
great
public
concern
i
paused
now
then
i
added
picking
up
one
of
the
other
papers
i
had
brought
myself
take
the
express
it
says
that
the
plans
were
important
but
would
have
been
made
public
in
a
few
months
anyhow
here
the
theft
or
mislaying
as
the
department
hopes
it
will
prove
to
be
took
place
several
days
ago
official
confirmation
of
the
report
is
lacking
but
from
trustworthy
unofficial
sources
it
is
learned
that
only
unimportant
parts
of
plans
are
missing
presumably
minor
structural
details
of
construction
and
other
things
of
a
really
trivial
character
such
as
copies
of
naval
regulations
etc
the
attempt
to
make
a
sensational
connection
between
the
loss
and
a
controversy
which
is
now
going
on
with
a
foreign
government
is
greatly
to
be
deplored
and
is
emphatically
asserted
to
be
utterly
baseless
it
bears
traces
of
the
jingoism
of
those
which
are
urging
naval
increases
there
is
usually
very
little
about
a
that
is
not
known
before
her
keel
is
laid
or
even
before
the
signing
of
the
contracts
at
any
rate
when
it
is
asserted
that
the
plans
represent
the
dernier
cri
in
some
form
of
war
preparation
it
is
well
to
remember
that
a
cry
is
last
only
until
there
is
a
later
naval
secrets
are
few
anyway
and
as
it
takes
some
years
to
apply
them
this
loss
can
not
be
of
superlative
value
to
any
one
still
there
is
of
course
a
market
for
such
information
in
spite
of
the
progress
toward
disarmament
but
the
rule
in
this
case
will
be
the
rule
as
in
a
horse
trade
emptor
so
there
you
are
i
concluded
you
pay
your
penny
for
a
paper
and
you
take
your
choice
and
the
star
inquired
kennedy
coming
to
the
door
and
adding
with
an
aggravating
grin
the
infallible
the
star
i
replied
unruffled
hits
the
point
squarely
when
it
says
that
whether
the
plans
were
of
immediate
importance
or
not
the
real
point
is
that
if
they
could
be
stolen
really
important
things
could
be
taken
also
for
instance
thought
of
what
the
thief
might
have
stolen
has
caused
much
more
alarm
than
the
knowledge
of
what
he
has
succeeded
in
taking
i
think
it
is
about
time
those
people
in
washington
stopped
the
leak
if
the
telephone
rang
insistently
i
think
that
for
me
exclaimed
craig
bounding
out
of
his
room
and
forgetting
his
quiz
of
me
hello
yes
is
that
you
burke
at
the
grand
central
half
an
hour
all
right
i
bringing
jameson
kennedy
jammed
down
the
receiver
on
the
hook
xix
the
submarine
mystery
the
star
was
not
far
from
right
walter
he
added
seriously
if
the
battleship
plans
could
be
stolen
other
things
could
be
other
things
were
you
remember
burke
of
the
secret
service
i
going
up
to
lookout
hill
on
the
connecticut
shore
of
the
sound
with
him
the
rewrite
men
on
the
record
did
have
the
facts
but
they
had
accurate
imaginations
the
most
vital
secret
that
any
navy
ever
had
that
would
have
enabled
us
in
a
couple
of
years
to
whip
the
navies
of
the
world
combined
against
us
has
been
stolen
and
that
is
i
asked
the
practical
of
the
newest
of
sciences
the
science
of
telautomatics
telautomatics
i
repeated
yes
there
is
something
weird
fascinating
about
the
very
idea
i
sit
up
here
safely
in
this
room
turning

ten
miles
away
a

a

an

a
submarine
obeys
me
it
may
carry
enough
of
the
latest
and
most
powerful
explosive
that
modern
science
can
invent
enough
if
exploded
to
rival

yet
it
obeys
my

it
goes
where
i
direct
it
it
explodes
where
i
want
it
and
it
wipes
off
the
face
of
the
earth
anything
which
i
want
annihilated
that
telautomatics
and
that
is
what
has
been
stolen
from
our
navy
and
dimly
sensed
by
you
clever
newspaper
men
from
whom
even
the
secret
service
ca
quite
hide
everything
the
publication
of
the
rumour
alone
that
the
government
knows
it
has
lost
something
has
put
the
secret
service
in
a
hole
what
might
have
been
done
quietly
and
in
a
few
days
has
got
to
be
done
in
the
glare
of
the
limelight
and
with
the
blare
of
a
brass
band
and
it
has
got
to
be
done
right
away
too
come
on
walter
i
thrown
together
all
we
shall
need
for
one
night
and
it
does
include
any
pajamas
either
a
few
minutes
later
we
met
our
friend
burke
of
the
secret
service
at
the
new
terminal
he
had
wired
kennedy
earlier
in
the
day
saying
that
he
would
be
in
new
york
and
would
call
him
up
the
plans
as
i
told
you
in
my
message
began
burke
when
we
had
seated
ourselves
in
a
compartment
of
the
pullman
were
those
of
captain
shirley
covering
the
submarine
the
old
captain
is
a
thoroughbred
too
i
known
him
in
washington
comes
of
an
old
new
england
family
with
plenty
of
money
but
more
brains
for
years
he
has
been
working
on
this
science
of
has
all
kinds
of
patents
which
he
has
dedicated
to
the
united
states
too
of
course
the
basic
pioneer
patents
are
not
his
his
work
has
been
in
the
practical
application
of
them
and
kennedy
there
are
some
secrets
about
his
latest
work
that
he
has
not
patented
he
has
given
them
outright
to
the
navy
department
because
they
are
too
valuable
even
to
patent
burke
who
liked
a
good
detective
tale
himself
seemed
pleased
at
holding
kennedy
spellbound
for
instance
he
went
on
he
has
on
the
bay
up
here
a
submarine
which
can
be
made
into
a
crewless
dirigible
he
calls
it
the
turtle
i
believe
because
that
was
the
name
of
the
first
american
submarine
built
by
bushnell
during
the
revolution
even
before
fulton
you
have
theories
of
your
own
on
the
case
asked
craig
well
there
are
several
possibilities
you
know
there
are
submarine
companies
in
this
country
bitter
rivals
they
might
like
to
have
those
plans
then
too
there
are
foreign
governments
he
paused
though
he
said
nothing
i
felt
that
there
was
no
doubt
what
he
hinted
at
at
least
one
government
occurred
to
me
which
would
like
the
plans
above
all
others
once
some
plans
of
a
submarine
were
stolen
i
recall
ruminated
kennedy
but
that
theft
i
am
satisfied
was
committed
in
behalf
of
a
rival
company
but
kennedy
exclaimed
burke
it
was
bad
enough
when
the
plans
were
stolen
now
captain
shirley
wires
me
that
some
one
must
have
tampered
with
his
model
it
does
work
right
he
even
believes
that
his
own
life
may
be
threatened
and
there
is
scarcely
a
real
clue
he
added
dejectedly
of
course
we
are
watching
all
the
employes
who
had
access
to
the
and
tracing
everybody
who
was
in
the
building
that
night
i
have
a
complete
list
of
them
there
are
three
or
four
who
will
bear
watching
for
instance
there
is
a
young
attache
of
one
of
the
embassies
named
nordheim
nordheim
i
echoed
involuntarily
i
had
expected
an
oriental
name
yes
a
german
i
have
been
looking
up
his
record
and
i
find
that
once
he
was
connected
in
some
way
with
the
famous
titan
iron
works
at
kiel
germany
we
began
watching
him
day
before
yesterday
but
suddenly
he
disappeared
then
there
is
a
society
woman
in
washington
a
bayard
brainard
who
was
at
the
department
that
night
we
have
been
trying
to
find
her
i
got
word
that
she
was
summering
in
the
cottage
colony
across
the
bay
from
lookout
hill
at
any
rate
i
had
to
go
up
there
to
see
the
captain
and
i
thought
i
kill
a
whole
flock
of
birds
with
one
stone
the
chief
thought
too
that
if
you
take
the
case
with
us
you
had
best
start
on
it
up
there
next
you
will
no
doubt
want
to
go
back
to
washington
with
me
lookout
hill
was
the
name
of
the
famous
old
estate
of
the
shirleys
on
a
point
of
land
jutting
out
into
long
island
sound
and
with
a
neighbouring
point
enclosing
a
large
deep
safe
harbour
on
the
highest
ground
of
the
estate
with
a
perfect
view
of
both
harbour
and
sound
stood
a
large
stone
house
the
home
of
captain
shirley
of
the
united
states
navy
retired
captain
shirley
a
man
of
or
three
bronzed
and
wiry
met
us
eagerly
so
this
is
professor
kennedy
i
glad
to
meet
you
sir
he
welcomed
clasping
craig
hand
in
both
of
his
a
fine
figure
as
he
stood
erect
in
the
light
of
the
portecochere
what
the
news
from
washington
burke
any
clues
i
can
hardly
tell
replied
the
secret
service
man
with
assumed
cheerfulness
by
the
way
you
have
to
excuse
me
for
a
few
minutes
while
i
run
back
into
town
on
a
little
errand
meanwhile
captain
will
you
explain
to
professor
kennedy
just
how
things
are
perhaps
better
begin
by
seeing
the
turtle
herself
burke
had
not
waited
longer
than
to
take
leave
the
turtle
repeated
the
captain
leading
the
way
into
the
house
well
i
did
call
it
that
at
first
but
i
prefer
to
call
it
the
you
know
the
first
submarines
abroad
at
least
were
sometimes
called
al
and
so
on
they
were
of
the
diving
plunging
type
that
is
they
submerged
on
an
inclined
keel
nose
down
like
the
hollands
then
came
the
b
type
in
which
the
hydroplane
appeared
the
c
type
in
which
it
was
more
prominent
and
a
d
type
where
submergence
is
on
a
perfectly
even
keel
somewhat
like
our
lakes
well
this
boat
of
mine
is
a
last
word
the
call
it
the
turtle
if
you
like
we
were
standing
for
a
moment
in
a
wide
colonial
hall
in
which
a
fire
was
crackling
in
a
huge
brick
fireplace
taking
the
chill
off
the
night
air
let
me
give
you
a
demonstration
first
added
the
captain
perhaps
will
work
perhaps
not
there
was
an
air
of
disappointment
about
the
old
veteran
as
he
spoke
uncertainly
now
of
what
a
short
time
ago
he
had
known
to
be
a
certainty
and
one
of
the
greatest
it
had
ever
been
given
the
inventive
mind
of
man
to
know
a
slip
of
a
girl
entered
from
the
library
saw
us
paused
and
was
about
to
turn
back
silhouetted
against
the
curtained
door
there
was
health
animation
gracefulness
in
every
line
of
her
wavy
chestnut
hair
her
soft
sparkling
brown
eyes
her
white
dress
and
hat
to
match
which
contrasted
with
the
healthy
glow
of
tan
on
her
full
neck
and
arms
and
her
dainty
little
white
shoes
ready
for
anything
from
tennis
to
tango
my
daughter
gladys
professor
kennedy
and
jameson
introduced
the
captain
we
are
going
to
try
the
again
gladys
a
moment
later
we
four
were
walking
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
where
captain
shirley
had
a
sort
of
workshop
and
he
lighted
the
gas
for
lookout
hill
was
only
on
the
edge
of
the
town
and
boasted
gas
electricity
and
all
modern
improvements
as
well
as
the
atmosphere
of
old
new
england
the
is
moored
just
below
us
at
my
private
dock
began
the
captain
i
have
a
shed
down
there
where
we
usually
keep
her
but
i
expected
you
and
she
is
waiting
thoroughly
overhauled
i
have
signalled
to
my
men
fellows
i
can
trust
too
who
used
to
be
with
me
in
the
navy
to
cast
her
off
there
now
we
are
ready
the
captain
turned
a
switch
instantly
a
couple
of
hundred
feet
below
us
on
the
dark
and
rippling
water
a
light
broke
forth
another
signal
and
the
light
changed
it
was
moving
the
principle
of
the
thing
said
captain
shirley
talking
to
us
but
watching
the
moving
light
intently
briefly
is
that
i
use
the
hertzian
waves
to
actuate
relays
on
the
that
is
i
send
a
child
with
a
message
the
grown
man
through
the
relay
so
to
speak
does
the
work
so
you
see
i
can
sit
up
here
and
send
my
little
david
out
anywhere
to
strike
down
a
huge
goliath
i
wo
bore
you
yet
with
explanations
of
my
the
telecommutator
the
aerial
coherer
relay
and
the
rest
of
the
technicalities
of
wireless
control
of
dirigible
vessels
they
are
well
known
beginning
with
pioneers
like
wilson
and
gardner
in
england
roberts
in
australia
wirth
and
lirpa
in
germany
gabet
in
france
and
tesla
edison
sims
and
the
younger
hammond
in
our
own
country
the
one
thing
you
may
not
know
that
has
kept
us
back
while
wireless
telegraphy
has
gone
ahead
so
fast
is
that
in
wireless
we
have
been
able
to
discard
coherers
and
relays
and
use
detectors
and
microphones
in
their
places
but
in
telautomatics
we
have
to
keep
the
coherer
that
has
been
the
barrier
the
coherer
until
recently
has
been
spasmodic
until
we
had
hammond
mercury
coherer
and
now
my
own
why
he
cried
we
are
just
on
the
threshold
now
of
this
great
science
which
tesla
has
named
telautomatics
the
electric
arm
that
we
can
stretch
out
through
space
to
do
our
work
and
fight
our
battles
it
was
not
difficult
to
feel
the
enthusiasm
of
the
captain
over
an
invention
of
such
momentous
possibilities
especially
as
the
was
well
out
in
the
harbour
now
and
we
could
see
her
flashing
her
red
and
green
back
to
us
you
see
the
captain
resumed
i
have
twelve
numbers
here
on
the
keys
of
this
forward
back
stop
propeller
motor
rudder
right
rudder
left
stop
steering
motor
light
signals
front
light
signals
rear
launch
torpedoes
and
so
on
the
idea
is
that
of
a
delayed
contact
the
machinery
is
always
ready
but
it
delays
a
few
seconds
until
the
right
impulse
is
given
a
purely
mechanical
problem
i
take
advantage
of
the
delay
to
have
the
message
repeated
by
a
signal
back
to
me
i
can
even
change
it
then
you
can
see
for
yourself
that
it
really
takes
no
experience
to
run
the
thing
when
all
is
going
right
gladys
has
done
it
frequently
herself
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
pay
attention
and
press
the
right
key
for
the
necessary
change
it
is
when
things
go
wrong
that
even
an
expert
like
myself
confound
it
something
wrong
the
had
suddenly
swerved
captain
shirley
brow
knitted
we
gathered
around
closer
gladys
next
to
her
father
and
leaning
anxiously
over
the
transmitting
apparatus
i
wanted
to
turn
her
to
port
yet
she
goes
to
starboard
and
signals
starboard
too
there
now
she
has
stopped
altogether
what
do
you
think
of
that
gladys
stroked
the
old
seafarer
hand
gently
as
he
sat
silently
at
the
table
peering
with
contracted
brows
out
into
the
now
brilliantly
moonlit
night
shirley
looked
up
at
his
daughter
and
the
lines
on
his
face
relaxed
as
though
he
would
hide
his
disappointment
from
her
eager
eyes
confound
that
light
what
the
matter
with
it
he
exclaimed
changing
the
subject
and
glancing
up
at
the
kennedy
had
already
been
intently
looking
at
the
welsbach
burner
overhead
which
had
been
flickering
incessantly
that
gas
company
added
the
captain
shaking
his
head
in
disgust
and
showing
annoyance
over
a
trivial
thing
to
hide
deep
concern
over
a
greater
as
some
men
do
i
shall
use
the
electricity
altogether
after
this
contract
with
the
company
expires
i
suppose
you
literary
men
jameson
would
call
that
the
light
that
failed
there
was
a
forced
air
about
his
attempt
to
be
facetious
that
did
not
conceal
but
rather
accentuated
the
undercurrent
of
feelings
in
him
on
the
contrary
broke
in
kennedy
i
should
be
surprised
to
find
that
it
is
the
light
that
succeeded
how
do
you
mean
i
would
have
said
anything
about
it
if
you
had
noticed
it
yourself
in
fact
i
may
be
wrong
it
suggests
something
to
me
but
it
will
need
a
good
deal
of
work
to
verify
it
and
then
it
may
not
be
of
any
significance
is
that
the
way
the
has
behaved
always
lately
yes
but
i
know
that
she
has
broken
down
of
herself
captain
shirley
asserted
it
never
did
before
not
since
i
perfected
that
new
coherer
and
now
it
always
does
perhaps
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
after
i
start
her
out
shirley
was
watching
the
lights
as
they
serpentined
their
way
to
us
across
the
nearly
calm
water
of
the
bay
idly
toying
with
the
now
useless
combinator
wait
here
he
said
rising
hurriedly
i
must
send
my
out
there
to
pick
her
up
and
tow
her
in
he
was
gone
down
the
flight
of
rustic
steps
on
the
face
of
the
cliff
before
we
could
reply
i
wish
father
would
take
it
to
heart
so
murmured
gladys
sometimes
i
fear
that
success
or
failure
of
this
boat
means
life
or
death
to
him
that
is
exactly
why
we
are
here
reassured
kennedy
turning
earnestly
to
her
to
help
him
to
settle
this
thing
at
once
this
is
a
beautiful
spot
he
added
as
we
stood
on
the
edge
of
the
cliff
and
looked
far
out
over
the
tossing
waves
of
the
sound
what
is
on
that
other
point
asked
kennedy
turning
again
toward
the
harbour
itself
there
is
a
large
cottage
colony
there
she
replied
of
course
many
of
the
houses
are
still
closed
so
early
in
the
season
but
it
is
a
beautiful
place
in
the
summer
the
hotel
over
there
is
open
now
though
you
must
have
a
lively
time
when
the
season
is
at
its
height
ventured
kennedy
do
you
know
a
cottager
there
a
mrs
brainard
oh
yes
indeed
i
have
known
her
in
washington
for
some
time
no
doubt
the
cottagers
envy
you
your
isolation
here
remarked
kennedy
turning
and
surveying
the
beautifully
kept
grounds
i
should
think
it
would
be
pleasant
too
to
have
an
old
washington
friend
here
it
is
we
often
invite
our
friends
over
for
and
other
little
entertainments
brainard
has
just
arrived
and
has
only
had
time
to
return
my
first
visit
to
her
but
i
expect
we
shall
have
some
good
times
this
summer
it
was
evident
at
least
that
gladys
was
not
concealing
anything
about
her
friend
whether
there
was
any
suspicion
or
not
of
her
we
had
gone
into
the
house
to
await
the
return
of
captain
shirley
burke
had
just
returned
his
face
betraying
that
he
was
bursting
with
news
she
here
all
right
he
remarked
in
an
undertone
to
kennedy
in
the
stamford
cottage
quite
an
outfit
french
chauffeur
two
japanese
servants
maids
and
all
the
stamford
cottage
repeated
gladys
why
that
is
where
brainard
lives
she
gave
a
startled
glance
at
kennedy
as
she
suddenly
seemed
to
realise
that
both
he
and
the
man
had
spoken
about
her
friend
yes
said
burke
noting
on
the
instant
the
perfect
innocence
of
her
concern
what
do
you
know
about
brainard
who
where
is
mr
brainard
dead
i
believe
gladys
hesitated
brainard
has
been
well
known
in
washington
circles
for
years
indeed
i
invited
her
with
us
the
night
of
the
manila
display
and
mr
nordheim
broke
in
burke
she
hesitated
he
was
there
but
i
do
know
as
whose
guest
did
he
seem
very
friendly
with
mrs
brainard
pursued
the
detective
i
thought
i
saw
a
shade
of
relief
pass
over
her
face
as
she
answered
yes
i
could
only
interpret
it
that
perhaps
nordheim
had
been
attentive
to
gladys
herself
and
that
she
had
not
welcomed
his
attentions
i
may
as
well
tell
you
she
said
at
length
it
is
no
secret
in
our
set
and
i
suppose
you
would
find
it
out
soon
anyhow
it
is
said
that
he
is
engaged
to
brainard
that
is
all
engaged
repeated
burke
then
that
would
account
for
his
being
at
the
hotel
here
at
least
it
would
offer
an
excuse
gladys
was
not
slow
to
note
the
stress
that
burke
laid
on
the
last
word
oh
impossible
she
began
hurriedly
impossible
that
he
could
have
known
anything
about
this
other
matter
why
she
told
me
he
was
to
sail
suddenly
for
germany
and
came
up
here
for
a
last
visit
before
he
went
and
to
arrange
to
come
back
on
his
return
oh
he
could
know
nothing
impossible
why
impossible
persisted
burke
they
have
submarines
in
germany
do
they
and
rival
companies
too
who
have
rival
companies
inquired
a
familiar
voice
it
was
captain
shirley
who
had
returned
out
of
breath
from
his
long
climb
up
the
steps
from
the
shore
the
germans
i
was
speaking
of
an
attache
named
nordheim
who
is
nordheim
inquired
the
captain
you
met
him
at
the
naval
building
that
night
do
you
remember
replied
gladys
oh
yes
i
believe
i
do
dimly
he
was
the
man
who
seemed
so
devoted
to
mrs
brainard
i
think
he
is
too
father
she
replied
hastily
he
has
been
suddenly
called
to
berlin
and
planned
to
spend
the
last
few
days
here
at
the
hotel
so
as
to
be
near
her
she
told
me
that
he
had
been
ordered
back
to
washington
again
before
he
sailed
and
had
had
to
cut
his
visit
short
when
did
you
first
notice
the
interference
with
the
turtle
asked
burke
i
received
your
message
this
morning
yesterday
morning
was
the
first
replied
the
captain
he
arrived
the
night
before
and
did
not
leave
until
yesterday
afternoon
remarked
burke
and
we
arrived
put
in
craig
quietly
the
interference
is
going
on
yet
then
the
japs
i
cut
in
at
last
giving
voice
to
the
suspicion
i
had
of
the
clever
little
orientals
they
could
not
have
stolen
the
plans
asserted
burke
shaking
his
head
no
nordheim
and
brainard
were
the
only
ones
who
could
have
got
into
the
draughting
room
the
night
of
the
manila
celebration
burke
said
kennedy
rising
i
wish
you
would
take
me
into
town
there
are
a
few
messages
i
would
like
to
send
you
will
excuse
us
captain
for
a
few
hours
good
evening
miss
shirley
as
he
bowed
i
heard
kennedy
add
to
her
do
worry
about
your
father
everything
will
come
out
all
right
soon
outside
in
the
car
which
burke
had
hired
craig
added
not
to
town
that
was
an
excuse
not
to
alarm
miss
shirley
too
much
over
her
friend
take
us
over
past
the
stamford
cottage
first
the
stamford
cottage
was
on
the
beach
between
the
shore
front
and
the
road
it
was
not
a
new
place
but
was
built
in
the
hideous
style
of
some
thirty
years
ago
with
all
sorts
of
little
turned
and
knobby
ornaments
we
paused
down
the
road
a
bit
though
not
long
enough
to
attract
attention
there
were
lights
on
every
floor
of
the
cottage
although
most
of
the
neighbouring
cottages
were
dark
well
protected
by
remarked
kennedy
as
he
looked
the
stamford
cottage
over
narrowly
we
might
as
well
drive
on
keep
an
eye
on
the
hotel
burke
it
may
be
that
nordheim
intends
to
return
after
all
assuming
that
he
has
left
returned
the
man
but
you
said
he
had
left
said
kennedy
what
do
you
mean
i
hardly
know
myself
wearily
remarked
burke
on
whom
the
strain
of
the
case
to
which
we
were
still
fresh
had
begun
to
tell
i
only
know
that
i
called
up
washington
after
i
heard
he
had
been
at
the
hotel
and
no
one
at
our
headquarters
knew
that
he
had
returned
they
may
have
fallen
down
but
they
were
to
watch
both
his
rooms
and
the
embassy
mused
kennedy
why
did
you
say
that
before
why
i
assumed
that
he
had
gone
back
until
you
told
me
there
was
interference
too
now
until
i
can
locate
him
definitely
all
at
sea
that
all
it
was
now
getting
late
in
the
evening
but
kennedy
had
evidently
no
intention
of
returning
yet
to
lookout
hill
we
paused
at
the
hotel
which
was
in
the
centre
of
the
cottage
colony
and
flanked
by
a
hill
that
ran
back
of
the
colony
diagonally
and
from
which
a
view
of
both
the
hotel
and
the
cottages
could
be
obtained
burke
inquiries
developed
the
fact
that
nordheim
had
left
very
hurriedly
and
in
some
agitation
to
tell
you
the
truth
confided
the
clerk
with
whom
burke
had
ingratiated
himself
i
thought
he
acted
like
a
man
who
was
watched
late
as
it
was
kennedy
insisted
on
motoring
to
the
railroad
station
and
catching
the
last
train
to
new
york
as
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
that
i
could
do
at
lookout
hill
i
accompanied
him
on
the
long
and
tedious
ride
which
brought
us
back
to
the
city
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
we
stopped
just
long
enough
to
run
up
to
the
laboratory
and
to
secure
a
couple
of
little
instruments
which
looked
very
much
like
small
incandescent
lamps
in
a
box
then
by
the
earliest
train
from
new
york
we
returned
to
lookout
hill
with
only
such
sleep
as
kennedy
had
predicted
snatched
in
the
day
coaches
of
the
trains
and
during
a
brief
wait
in
the
station
a
freshening
up
with
a
dip
in
the
biting
cold
water
of
the
bay
breakfast
with
captain
shirley
and
miss
gladys
and
a
return
to
the
excitement
of
the
case
had
to
serve
in
place
of
rest
burke
disappeared
after
a
hasty
conference
with
kennedy
presumably
to
watch
brainard
the
hotel
and
the
stamford
cottage
to
see
who
went
in
and
out
i
had
the
brought
out
of
its
shed
remarked
the
captain
as
we
rose
from
the
there
was
nothing
wrong
as
far
as
i
could
discover
last
night
or
by
a
more
careful
inspection
this
morning
i
like
to
have
you
take
a
look
at
her
now
in
the
daylight
i
was
about
to
suggest
remarked
kennedy
as
we
descended
the
steps
to
the
shore
that
perhaps
first
it
might
be
well
to
take
a
short
run
in
her
with
the
crew
just
to
make
sure
that
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
the
machinery
a
good
idea
agreed
the
captain
we
came
to
the
submarine
lying
alongside
the
dock
and
looking
like
a
huge
cigar
the
captain
preceded
us
down
the
narrow
hatchway
and
i
followed
craig
the
deck
was
cleared
the
hatch
closed
and
the
vessel
sealed
xx
the
wireless
detector
remembering
jules
verne
enticing
picture
of
life
on
the
palatial
nautilus
i
may
as
well
admit
that
i
was
not
prepared
for
a
real
submarine
my
first
impression
as
i
entered
the
hold
was
that
of
discomfort
and
suffocation
i
felt
too
that
i
was
too
close
to
too
much
whirring
machinery
i
gazed
about
curiously
on
all
sides
were
electrical
devices
and
machines
to
operate
the
craft
and
the
torpedoes
i
thought
also
that
the
water
outside
was
uncomfortably
close
one
could
almost
feel
it
the
was
low
roofed
damp
with
an
intricate
system
of
rods
controls
engines
tanks
compasses
gauges
more
things
than
it
seemed
the
human
mind
to
say
nothing
of
wireless
could
possibly
attend
to
at
once
the
policy
of
secrecy
which
governments
keep
in
regard
to
submarines
remarked
the
captain
running
his
eye
over
everything
at
once
it
seemed
has
led
them
to
be
looked
upon
as
something
mysterious
but
whatever
you
may
think
of
telautomatics
there
is
really
no
mystery
about
an
ordinary
submarine
i
did
not
agree
with
our
captain
nemo
as
the
examination
completed
he
threw
in
a
switch
the
motor
started
the
hummed
and
trembled
the
fumes
of
gasoline
were
almost
suffocating
at
first
in
spite
of
the
prompt
ventilation
to
clear
them
off
there
was
no
escape
from
the
smell
i
had
heard
of
gasoline
heart
but
the
odour
only
made
me
sick
and
dizzy
like
most
novices
i
suppose
i
was
suffering
excruciating
torture
not
so
kennedy
he
got
used
to
it
in
no
time
indeed
seemed
to
enjoy
the
very
discomfort
i
felt
that
there
was
only
one
thing
necessary
to
add
to
it
and
that
was
the
odour
of
cooking
cooking
by
the
way
on
a
submarine
is
uncertain
and
disagreeable
there
was
a
little
electric
heater
i
found
which
might
possibly
have
heated
enough
water
for
one
cup
of
coffee
at
a
time
in
fact
space
was
economised
to
the
utmost
only
the
necessaries
of
life
were
there
every
inch
that
could
be
spared
was
given
over
to
machinery
it
was
everywhere
compact
efficient
everything
for
running
the
boat
under
water
guiding
it
above
and
below
controlling
its
submersion
compressing
air
firing
torpedoes
and
a
thousand
other
things
it
was
wonderful
as
it
was
but
when
one
reflected
that
all
could
be
done
automatically
or
rather
telautomatically
it
was
simply
astounding
you
see
observed
captain
shirley
when
she
is
working
automatically
neither
the
periscope
nor
the
shows
the
wireless
impulses
are
carried
down
to
her
from
an
inconspicuous
float
which
trails
along
the
surface
and
carries
a
short
aerial
with
a
wire
running
down
like
a
mast
forming
practically
invisible
antennae
as
he
was
talking
the
boat
was
being
trimmed
by
admitting
water
as
ballast
into
the
proper
tanks
the
he
went
on
is
a
submersible
not
a
diving
submarine
that
is
to
say
the
rudder
guides
it
and
changes
the
angle
of
the
boat
but
the
hydroplanes
pull
it
up
and
down
two
pairs
of
them
set
fore
and
aft
of
the
centre
of
gravity
they
lift
or
lower
the
boat
bodily
on
an
even
keel
not
by
plunging
and
diving
i
will
now
set
the
hydroplanes
at
ten
degrees
down
and
the
horizontal
rudder
two
degrees
up
and
the
boat
will
submerge
to
a
depth
of
thirty
feet
and
run
constant
at
that
depth
he
had
shut
off
the
gasoline
motor
and
started
the
electric
motor
which
was
used
when
running
submerged
the
great
motors
gave
out
a
strange
humming
sound
the
crew
conversed
in
low
constrained
tones
there
was
a
slightly
perceptible
jar
and
the
boat
seemed
to
quiver
just
a
bit
from
stem
to
stern
in
front
of
shirley
was
a
gauge
which
showed
the
depth
of
submergence
and
a
which
showed
any
inclination
submerged
he
remarked
is
like
running
on
the
surface
under
conditions
i
did
not
agree
with
those
who
have
said
there
is
no
difference
running
submerged
or
on
the
surface
under
way
on
the
surface
was
one
thing
but
when
we
dived
it
was
most
unpleasant
i
had
been
reassured
at
the
start
when
i
heard
that
there
were
ten
tanks
under
a
pressure
of
two
thousand
pounds
to
the
square
inch
but
only
once
before
had
i
breathed
compressed
air
and
that
was
when
one
of
our
cases
once
took
us
down
into
the
tunnels
below
the
rivers
of
new
york
it
was
not
a
new
sensation
but
at
fifty
feet
depth
i
felt
a
little
tingling
all
over
my
body
a
pounding
of
the
and
just
a
trace
of
nausea
kennedy
smiled
as
i
moved
about
never
mind
walter
he
said
i
know
how
you
feel
on
a
first
trip
one
minute
you
are
choking
from
lack
of
oxygen
then
in
another
part
of
the
boat
you
are
exhilarated
by
too
much
of
it
still
he
winked
do
forget
that
it
is
regulated
well
i
returned
all
i
can
say
is
that
if
war
is
hell
a
submarine
is
war
i
had
however
been
much
interested
in
the
things
about
me
forward
the
tubes
and
other
apparatus
about
the
little
doors
in
the
vessel
nose
made
it
look
somewhat
like
the
shield
used
in
boring
a
tunnel
under
compressed
air
ordinary
use
the
regular
automobile
torpedo
remarked
captain
shirley
coming
ubiquitously
up
behind
me
i
improve
on
that
i
can
discharge
the
telautomobile
torpedo
and
guide
it
either
from
the
boat
as
we
are
now
or
from
the
land
station
where
we
were
last
night
at
will
there
was
something
more
than
pride
in
his
manner
he
was
deadly
in
earnest
about
his
invention
we
had
come
over
to
the
periscope
the
eye
of
the
submarine
when
she
is
running
just
under
the
surface
but
of
no
use
that
we
were
below
yes
he
remarked
in
answer
to
my
question
that
is
the
periscope
usually
there
is
one
fixed
to
look
ahead
and
another
that
is
movable
in
order
to
take
in
what
is
on
the
sides
and
in
the
rear
i
have
both
of
those
but
in
addition
i
have
the
universal
periscope
the
eye
that
sees
all
around
three
hundred
and
sixty
degrees
a
very
clever
application
of
an
annular
prism
with
objectives
condenser
and
two
eyepieces
of
low
and
high
power
a
call
from
one
of
the
crew
took
him
into
the
stern
to
watch
the
operation
of
something
leaving
me
to
myself
for
kennedy
was
roaming
about
on
a
still
hunt
for
anything
that
might
suggest
itself
the
safety
devices
probably
more
than
any
other
single
thing
interested
me
for
i
had
read
with
peculiar
fascination
of
the
great
disasters
to
the
lutin
the
pluviose
the
farfardet
the
the
foca
the
kambala
the
japanese
no
the
german
and
others
below
us
i
knew
there
was
a
keel
that
could
be
dropped
lightening
the
boat
considerably
also
there
was
the
submarine
bell
immersed
in
a
tank
of
water
with
telephone
receivers
attached
by
which
one
could
listen
in
for
example
before
rising
say
from
sixty
feet
to
twenty
feet
and
thus
hear
the
hulls
of
other
ships
the
bell
was
struck
by
means
of
air
pressure
and
was
the
same
as
that
used
for
submarine
signalling
on
ships
water
being
dense
is
an
excellent
conductor
of
sound
even
in
the
submarine
itself
i
could
hear
the
muffled
clang
of
the
gong
then
there
were
buoys
which
could
be
released
and
would
fly
to
the
surface
carrying
within
them
a
telephone
a
light
and
a
whistle
i
knew
also
something
of
the
explosion
dangers
on
a
submarine
both
from
the
fuel
oil
used
when
running
on
the
surface
and
from
the
storage
batteries
used
when
running
submerged
once
in
a
while
a
sailor
would
take
from
a
jar
a
piece
of
litmus
paper
and
expose
it
showing
only
a
slight
discolouration
due
to
carbon
dioxide
that
was
the
least
of
my
troubles
for
a
few
moments
also
the
white
mice
in
a
cage
interested
me
white
mice
were
carried
because
they
dislike
the
odour
of
gasoline
and
give
warning
of
any
leakage
by
loud
squeals
the
fact
was
that
there
was
so
much
of
interest
that
the
first
discomfort
over
i
was
like
kennedy
beginning
really
to
enjoy
the
trip
i
was
startled
suddenly
to
hear
the
motors
stop
there
was
no
more
of
that
interminable
buzzing
the
responded
promptly
to
the
air
pressure
that
was
forcing
the
water
out
of
the
tanks
the
gauge
showed
that
we
were
gradually
rising
on
an
even
keel
a
man
sprang
up
the
narrow
hatchway
and
opened
the
cover
through
which
we
could
see
a
little
patch
of
blue
sky
again
the
gasoline
motor
was
started
and
we
ran
leisurely
back
to
the
dock
the
trip
was
over
safely
as
we
landed
i
felt
a
sense
of
gladness
to
get
away
from
that
feeling
of
being
cut
off
from
the
world
it
was
not
fear
of
death
or
of
the
water
as
nearly
as
i
could
analyse
it
but
merely
that
terrible
sense
of
isolation
from
man
and
nature
as
we
know
it
a
message
from
burke
was
waiting
for
kennedy
at
the
wharf
he
read
it
quickly
then
handed
it
to
captain
shirley
and
myself
have
just
received
a
telegram
from
washington
great
excitement
at
the
embassy
cipher
telegram
has
been
despatched
to
the
titan
iron
works
one
of
my
men
in
washington
reports
a
queer
experience
he
had
been
following
one
of
the
members
of
the
embassy
staff
who
saw
he
was
being
shadowed
turned
suddenly
on
the
man
and
exclaimed
why
are
you
hounding
us
still
what
do
you
make
of
it
no
trace
yet
of
nordheim
burke
the
lines
in
craig
face
deepened
in
thought
as
he
folded
the
message
and
remarked
abstractedly
she
works
all
right
when
you
are
aboard
then
he
recalled
himself
let
us
try
her
again
without
a
crew
five
minutes
later
we
had
ascended
to
the
aerial
and
all
was
in
readiness
to
repeat
the
trial
of
the
night
before
vicious
and
sly
the
looked
in
the
daytime
as
she
slipped
off
under
the
unseen
guidance
of
the
wireless
with
death
hidden
under
her
nose
just
as
during
the
first
trial
we
had
witnessed
she
began
by
fulfilling
the
highest
expectations
straight
as
an
arrow
she
shot
out
of
the
harbour
mouth
half
submerged
with
her
periscope
sticking
up
and
bearing
the
flag
proudly
flapping
leaving
behind
a
wake
of
white
foam
she
turned
and
the
harbour
obeying
captain
shirley
every
whim
twisting
in
and
out
of
the
shipping
much
to
the
amazement
of
the
old
salts
who
had
never
become
used
to
the
weird
sight
she
cut
a
figure
eight
stopped
started
again
suddenly
i
could
see
by
the
look
on
captain
shirley
face
that
something
was
wrong
before
either
of
us
could
speak
there
was
a
spurt
of
water
out
in
the
harbour
a
cloud
of
spray
and
the
sank
in
a
mass
of
bubbles
she
had
heeled
over
and
was
resting
on
the
mud
and
ooze
of
the
harbour
bottom
the
water
had
closed
over
her
and
she
was
gone
instantly
all
the
terrible
details
of
the
sinking
of
the
lutin
and
other
submarines
flashed
over
me
i
fancied
i
could
see
on
the
the
overturned
accumulators
i
imagined
the
stifling
fumes
the
struggle
for
breath
in
the
suddenly
darkened
hull
almost
as
if
it
had
happened
half
an
hour
ago
i
saw
it
thank
god
for
telautomatics
i
murmured
as
the
thought
swept
over
me
of
what
we
had
escaped
no
one
was
aboard
her
at
least
chlorine
was
escaping
rapidly
from
the
overturned
storage
batteries
for
a
grave
danger
lurks
in
the
presence
of
sea
water
in
a
submarine
in
combination
with
any
of
the
sulphuric
acid
salt
water
and
sulphuric
acid
produce
chlorine
gas
and
a
pint
of
it
inside
a
submarine
would
be
sufficient
to
render
unconscious
the
crew
of
a
boat
i
began
to
realise
the
risks
we
had
run
which
my
confidence
in
captain
shirley
had
minimised
i
wondered
whether
hydrogen
in
dangerous
quantities
might
not
be
given
off
and
with
the
of
the
batteries
perhaps
explode
nothing
more
happened
however
all
kinds
of
theories
suggested
themselves
perhaps
in
some
way
the
gasoline
motor
had
been
started
while
the
boat
was
depressed
the
gas
had
escaped
combined
with
air
and
a
spark
had
caused
an
explosion
there
were
so
many
possibilities
that
it
staggered
me
captain
shirley
sat
stunned
yet
here
was
the
one
great
question
whence
had
come
the
impulse
that
had
sent
the
famous
to
her
fate
could
it
have
been
through
something
internal
i
asked
could
a
current
from
one
of
the
batteries
have
influenced
the
receiving
apparatus
no
replied
the
captain
mechanically
i
have
a
secret
method
of
protecting
my
receiving
instruments
from
such
impulses
within
the
hull
kennedy
was
sitting
silently
in
the
corner
oblivious
to
us
up
to
this
point
but
not
to
impulses
from
outside
the
hull
he
broke
in
unobserved
he
had
been
bending
over
one
of
the
little
instruments
which
had
kept
us
up
all
night
and
bad
cost
a
tedious
trip
to
new
york
and
back
what
that
i
asked
this
this
is
a
little
instrument
known
as
the
audion
a
wireless
detector
outside
the
hull
repeated
shirley
still
dazed
yes
cried
kennedy
excitedly
i
got
my
first
clue
from
that
flickering
welsbach
mantle
last
night
of
course
it
flickered
from
the
wireless
we
were
using
but
it
kept
on
you
know
in
the
there
is
matter
in
a
most
mobile
and
tenuous
state
very
sensitive
to
heat
and
sound
vibrations
now
the
audion
as
you
see
consists
of
two
platinum
wings
parallel
to
the
plane
of
a
bowed
filament
of
an
incandescent
light
in
a
vacuum
it
was
invented
by
lee
deforest
to
detect
wireless
when
the
light
is
turned
on
and
the
little
tantalum
filament
glows
it
is
ready
for
business
it
can
be
used
for
all
systems
of
wireless
singing
spark
quenched
spark
arc
sets
telephone
sets
in
fact
it
will
detect
a
wireless
wave
from
whatever
source
it
is
sent
it
is
so
susceptible
that
a
man
with
one
attached
to
an
ordinary
umbrella
on
a
rainy
night
can
pick
up
wireless
messages
that
are
being
transmitted
within
some
hundreds
of
miles
radius
the
audion
buzzed
there
see
our
wireless
is
not
working
but
with
the
audion
you
can
see
that
some
wireless
is
and
a
fairly
near
and
powerful
source
it
is
too
kennedy
was
absorbed
in
watching
the
audion
suddenly
he
turned
and
faced
us
he
had
evidently
reached
a
conclusion
captain
he
cried
can
you
send
a
wireless
message
yes
well
this
is
to
burke
he
is
over
there
back
of
the
hotel
on
the
hill
with
some
of
his
men
he
has
one
there
who
understands
wireless
and
to
whom
i
have
given
another
audion
quick
before
this
other
wireless
cuts
in
on
us
again
i
want
others
to
get
the
message
as
well
as
burke
send
this
your
men
watch
the
railroad
station
and
every
road
to
it
surround
the
stamford
cottage
there
is
some
wireless
interference
from
that
direction
as
shirley
with
a
light
in
his
eyes
flashed
the
message
mechanically
through
space
craig
rose
and
signalled
to
the
house
under
the
portecochere
i
saw
a
waiting
automobile
which
an
instant
later
tore
up
the
path
and
whirled
around
almost
on
two
wheels
near
the
edge
of
the
cliff
glowing
with
health
and
excitement
gladys
shirley
was
at
the
wheel
herself
in
spite
of
the
tenseness
of
the
situation
i
could
not
help
stopping
to
admire
the
change
in
the
graceful
girlish
figure
of
the
night
before
which
was
now
all
lithe
energy
and
alertness
in
her
eager
devotion
to
carrying
out
the
minutest
detail
of
kennedy
plan
to
aid
her
father
excellent
miss
shirley
exclaimed
kennedy
but
when
i
asked
burke
to
have
you
keep
a
car
in
readiness
i
had
no
idea
you
would
drive
it
yourself
i
like
it
she
remonstrated
as
he
offered
to
take
the
wheel
please
please
let
me
drive
i
shall
go
crazy
if
i
not
doing
something
i
saw
the
go
down
what
was
it
who
captain
called
craig
quick
into
the
car
we
must
hurry
to
the
stamford
house
miss
shirley
no
one
can
get
away
from
it
before
we
arrive
it
is
surrounded
everything
was
quiet
apparently
about
the
house
as
our
wild
ride
around
the
edge
of
the
harbour
ended
under
the
deft
guidance
of
gladys
shirley
here
and
there
behind
a
hedge
or
tree
i
could
see
a
lurking
man
burke
joined
us
from
behind
a
barn
next
door
not
a
soul
has
gone
in
or
out
he
whispered
there
does
not
seem
to
be
a
sign
of
life
there
craig
and
burke
had
by
this
time
reached
the
broad
veranda
they
did
not
wait
to
ring
the
bell
but
carried
the
door
down
literally
off
its
hinges
we
followed
closely
a
scream
from
the
brought
us
to
a
halt
it
was
brainard
tall
almost
imperial
in
her
loose
morning
gown
her
dark
eyes
snapping
fire
at
the
sudden
intrusion
i
could
not
tell
whether
she
had
really
noticed
that
the
house
was
watched
or
was
acting
a
part
what
does
this
mean
she
demanded
what
gladys
you
florence
tell
them
it
is
so
is
it
you
do
know
a
thing
about
those
plans
of
father
that
were
stolen
that
night
where
is
nordheim
interjected
burke
quickly
a
little
of
his
third
degree
training
getting
the
upper
hand
nordheim
yes
you
know
tell
me
is
he
here
here
is
it
bad
enough
to
hound
him
without
hounding
me
too
will
you
merciless
detectives
drive
us
all
from
place
to
place
with
your
brutal
suspicions
merciless
inquired
burke
smiling
with
sarcasm
who
has
been
hounding
him
you
know
very
well
what
i
mean
she
repeated
drawing
herself
up
to
her
full
height
and
patting
gladys
hand
to
reassure
her
read
that
message
on
the
table
burke
picked
up
a
yellow
telegram
dated
new
york
two
days
before
it
was
as
i
feared
when
i
left
you
the
secret
service
must
have
rummaged
my
baggage
both
here
and
at
the
hotel
they
have
taken
some
very
valuable
papers
of
mine
secret
service
rummage
baggage
repeated
burke
himself
now
in
perplexity
that
is
news
to
me
we
have
rummaged
no
trunks
or
bags
least
of
all
nordheim
in
fact
we
have
never
been
able
to
find
them
at
all
upstairs
burke
the
servants
quarters
interrupted
craig
impatiently
we
are
wasting
time
here
brainard
offered
no
protest
i
began
to
think
that
the
whole
thing
was
indeed
a
surprise
to
her
and
that
she
had
in
fact
been
reading
instead
of
making
a
studied
effort
to
appear
surprised
at
our
intrusion
room
after
room
was
flung
open
without
finding
any
one
until
we
reached
the
attic
which
had
been
finished
off
into
several
rooms
one
door
was
closed
craig
opened
it
cautiously
it
was
pitch
dark
in
spite
of
the
broad
daylight
outside
we
entered
gingerly
on
the
floor
lay
two
dark
piles
of
something
my
foot
touched
one
of
them
i
drew
back
in
horror
at
the
feeling
it
was
the
body
of
a
man
kennedy
struck
a
light
and
as
he
bent
over
in
its
little
circle
of
radiance
he
disclosed
a
ghastly
scene
he
ejaculated
they
must
have
got
my
message
to
burke
and
have
seen
that
the
house
was
surrounded
the
two
japanese
servants
had
committed
suicide
does
it
all
mean
gasped
brainard
who
had
followed
us
upstairs
with
gladys
burke
lip
curled
slightly
and
he
was
about
to
speak
it
means
hastened
kennedy
that
you
have
been
double
crossed
brainard
nordheim
stole
those
plans
of
captain
shirley
submarine
for
his
titan
iron
works
then
the
japs
stole
them
from
his
baggage
at
the
hotel
he
thought
the
secret
service
had
them
the
japs
waited
here
just
long
enough
to
try
the
plans
against
the
herself
to
destroy
captain
shirley
work
by
his
own
method
of
destruction
it
was
clever
clever
it
would
make
his
labours
seem
like
a
failure
and
would
discourage
others
from
keeping
up
the
experiments
they
had
planned
to
steal
a
march
on
the
world
every
time
the
was
out
they
worked
up
here
with
their
improvised
wireless
until
they
found
the
shirley
was
using
it
took
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
but
they
managed
finally
to
interfere
so
that
they
sent
the
submarine
to
the
bottom
of
the
harbour
instead
of
being
the
criminal
burke
brainard
is
the
victim
the
victim
both
of
nordheim
and
of
her
servants
craig
had
thrown
open
a
window
and
had
dropped
down
on
his
knees
before
a
little
stove
by
which
the
room
was
heated
he
was
poking
eagerly
in
a
pile
of
charred
paper
and
linen
shirley
he
cried
your
secret
is
safe
even
though
the
duplicate
plans
were
stolen
there
will
be
no
more
interference
the
captain
seized
craig
by
both
hands
and
wrung
them
like
the
handle
of
a
pump
oh
thank
you
thank
you
thank
you
cried
gladys
running
up
and
almost
dancing
with
joy
at
the
change
in
her
father
i
i
could
almost
kiss
you
i
could
let
you
twinkled
craig
promptly
as
she
blushed
deeply
thank
you
too
brainard
he
added
turning
to
acknowledge
her
congratulations
also
i
am
glad
i
have
been
able
to
be
of
service
to
you
wo
you
come
back
to
the
house
for
dinner
urged
the
captain
kennedy
looked
at
me
and
smiled
walter
he
said
this
is
no
place
for
two
old
bachelors
like
us
then
turning
he
added
many
thanks
sir
but
seriously
last
night
we
slept
principally
in
day
coaches
really
i
must
turn
the
case
over
to
burke
now
and
get
back
to
the
city
early
they
insisted
on
accompanying
us
to
the
station
and
there
the
congratulations
were
done
all
over
again
why
exclaimed
kennedy
as
we
settled
ourselves
in
the
pullman
after
waving
a
final
i
shall
be
afraid
to
go
back
to
that
town
again
i
i
almost
did
kiss
her
then
his
face
settled
into
its
usual
stern
lines
although
softened
i
thought
i
am
sure
that
it
was
not
the
new
england
landscape
with
its
quaint
stone
fences
that
he
looked
at
out
of
the
window
but
the
recollection
of
the
bright
dashing
figure
of
gladys
shirley
it
was
seldom
that
a
girl
made
so
forcible
an
impression
on
kennedy
i
know
for
on
our
return
he
fairly
dived
into
work
like
the
herself
and
i
did
not
see
him
all
the
next
day
until
just
before
dinner
time
then
he
came
in
and
spent
half
an
hour
restoring
his
fingers
to
something
like
human
semblance
he
said
nothing
about
his
research
work
of
the
day
and
i
was
just
about
to
remark
that
a
day
had
passed
without
its
usual
fresh
alarum
and
excursion
when
a
tap
on
the
door
buzzer
was
followed
by
the
entrance
of
our
old
friend
andrews
head
of
the
great
eastern
life
insurance
company
own
detective
service
kennedy
he
began
i
have
a
startling
case
for
you
can
you
help
me
out
with
it
as
he
sat
down
heavily
he
pulled
from
his
immense
black
wallet
some
scraps
of
paper
and
newspaper
cuttings
you
recall
i
suppose
he
went
on
unfolding
the
papers
without
waiting
for
an
answer
the
recent
death
of
young
montague
phelps
at
woodbine
just
outside
the
city
kennedy
nodded
the
death
of
phelps
about
ten
days
before
had
attracted
attention
because
of
the
heroic
fight
for
life
he
had
made
against
what
the
doctors
admitted
had
puzzled
them
a
new
and
baffling
manifestation
of
coma
they
had
laboured
hard
to
keep
him
awake
but
had
not
succeeded
and
after
several
days
of
lying
in
a
comatose
state
he
had
finally
succumbed
it
was
one
of
those
strange
but
rather
frequent
cases
of
long
sleeps
reported
in
the
newspapers
although
it
was
by
no
means
one
which
might
be
classed
as
the
interest
in
phelps
lay
a
great
deal
in
the
fact
that
the
young
man
had
married
the
popular
dancer
anginette
petrovska
a
few
months
previously
his
honeymoon
trip
around
the
world
had
suddenly
been
interrupted
while
the
couple
were
crossing
siberia
by
the
news
of
the
failure
of
the
phelps
in
wall
street
and
the
practical
of
his
fortune
he
had
returned
only
to
fall
a
victim
to
a
greater
misfortune
a
few
days
before
his
death
continued
andrews
measuring
his
words
carefully
i
or
rather
the
great
eastern
which
had
been
secretly
investigating
the
case
received
this
letter
what
do
you
think
of
it
he
spread
out
on
the
table
a
crumpled
note
in
a
palpably
disguised
handwriting
to
whom
it
may
concern
you
would
do
well
to
look
into
the
death
of
montague
phelps
jr
i
accuse
no
one
assert
nothing
but
when
a
young
man
apparently
in
the
best
of
health
drops
off
so
mysteriously
and
even
the
physician
in
the
case
can
give
no
very
convincing
information
that
case
warrants
attention
i
know
what
i
know
an
outsider
xxi
the
ghouls
mused
kennedy
weighing
the
contents
of
the
note
carefully
one
of
the
family
i
be
bound
unless
the
whole
thing
is
a
hoax
by
the
way
who
else
is
there
in
the
immediate
family
only
a
brother
dana
phelps
younger
and
somewhat
inclined
to
wildness
i
believe
at
least
his
father
did
not
trust
him
with
a
large
inheritance
but
left
most
of
his
money
in
trust
but
before
we
go
any
further
read
that
andrews
pulled
from
the
papers
a
newspaper
cutting
on
which
he
had
drawn
a
circle
about
the
following
item
as
we
read
he
eyed
us
sharply
phelps
tomb
desecrated
last
night
john
shaughnessy
a
night
watchman
employed
by
the
town
of
woodbine
while
on
his
rounds
was
attracted
by
noises
as
of
a
violent
struggle
near
the
back
road
in
the
woodbine
cemetery
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
he
had
varied
his
regular
rounds
because
of
the
recent
depredations
of
yeggmen
who
had
timed
him
in
pulling
off
several
jobs
lately
as
he
hurried
toward
the
large
mausoleum
of
the
phelps
family
he
saw
two
figures
slink
away
in
opposite
directions
in
the
darkness
one
of
them
he
asserts
positively
seemed
to
be
a
woman
in
black
the
other
a
man
whom
he
could
not
see
clearly
they
readily
eluded
pursuit
in
the
shadows
and
a
moment
later
he
heard
the
whir
of
a
car
apparently
bearing
them
away
at
the
tomb
there
was
every
evidence
of
a
struggle
things
had
been
thrown
about
the
casket
had
been
broken
open
but
the
body
of
montague
phelps
which
had
been
interred
there
about
ten
days
ago
was
not
touched
or
mutilated
it
was
a
shocking
and
extraordinary
violation
shaughnessy
believes
that
some
personal
jewels
may
have
been
buried
with
phelps
and
that
the
thieves
were
after
them
that
they
fought
over
the
loot
and
in
the
midst
of
the
fight
were
scared
away
the
vault
is
of
peculiar
construction
a
costly
tomb
in
which
repose
the
bodies
of
the
late
montague
phelps
of
his
wife
and
now
of
his
eldest
son
the
raid
had
evidently
been
carefully
planned
to
coincide
with
a
time
when
shaughnessy
would
ordinarily
have
been
on
the
other
side
of
the
town
the
entrance
to
the
tomb
had
been
barred
but
during
the
commotion
the
ghouls
were
surprised
and
managed
to
escape
without
accomplishing
their
object
and
leaving
no
trace
phelps
when
informed
of
the
vandalism
was
shocked
and
has
been
in
a
very
nervous
state
since
the
tomb
was
forced
open
the
local
authorities
seem
extremely
anxious
that
every
precaution
should
be
taken
to
prevent
a
repetition
of
the
ghoulish
visit
to
the
tomb
but
as
yet
the
phelps
family
has
taken
no
steps
are
you
aware
of
any
scandal
any
skeleton
in
the
closet
in
the
family
asked
craig
looking
up
no
not
yet
considered
andrews
as
soon
as
i
heard
of
the
vandalism
i
began
to
wonder
what
could
have
happened
in
the
phelps
tomb
as
far
as
our
company
interests
were
concerned
you
see
that
was
yesterday
this
letter
came
along
he
added
laying
down
a
second
very
dirty
and
wrinkled
note
beside
the
first
it
was
quite
patently
written
by
a
different
person
from
the
first
its
purport
was
different
indeed
quite
the
opposite
of
the
other
it
was
sent
to
phelps
explained
andrews
and
she
gave
it
out
herself
to
the
police
do
not
show
this
to
the
police
unless
you
leave
in
gold
in
the
old
stump
in
the
swamp
across
from
the
cemetery
you
will
have
reason
to
regret
it
if
you
respect
the
memory
of
the
dead
do
this
and
do
it
quietly
black
hand
well
i
ejaculated
that
cool
what
threat
would
be
used
to
back
this
demand
on
the
phelpses
here
the
situation
resumed
andrews
puffing
violently
on
his
inevitable
cigar
and
toying
with
the
letters
and
clippings
we
have
already
held
up
payment
of
the
dollars
of
insurance
to
the
widow
as
long
as
we
can
consistently
do
so
but
we
must
pay
soon
scandal
or
not
unless
we
can
get
something
more
than
mere
conjecture
you
are
already
holding
it
up
queried
craig
yes
you
see
we
investigate
thoroughly
every
suspicious
death
in
most
cases
no
body
is
found
this
case
is
different
in
that
respect
there
is
a
body
and
it
is
the
body
of
the
insured
apparently
but
a
death
like
this
involving
the
least
mystery
receives
careful
examination
especially
if
as
in
this
case
it
has
recently
been
covered
by
heavy
policies
my
work
has
often
served
to
reverse
the
decision
of
doctors
and
coroners
juries
an
insurance
detective
as
you
can
readily
appreciate
kennedy
soon
comes
to
recognise
the
characteristics
in
the
crimes
with
which
he
deals
for
example
writing
of
the
insurance
plotted
for
rarely
precedes
the
conspiracy
to
defraud
that
is
i
know
of
few
cases
in
which
a
policy
originally
taken
out
in
good
faith
has
subsequently
become
the
means
of
a
swindle
in
cases
the
assassin
induces
the
victim
to
take
out
insurance
in
his
favour
in
suicide
cases
the
insured
does
so
himself
just
after
his
return
home
young
phelps
who
carried
fifty
thousand
dollars
already
applied
for
and
was
granted
one
of
the
largest
policies
we
have
ever
written
half
a
million
was
it
incontestible
without
the
suicide
clause
asked
kennedy
yes
replied
andrews
and
suicide
is
the
first
and
easiest
theory
why
you
have
no
idea
how
common
the
crime
of
suicide
for
the
sake
of
the
life
insurance
is
becoming
nowadays
we
insurance
men
almost
believe
that
every
one
who
contemplates
ending
his
existence
takes
out
a
policy
so
as
to
make
his
life
which
is
useless
to
him
a
benefit
at
least
to
some
one
and
a
nightmare
to
the
insurance
detective
i
know
i
cut
in
for
i
recalled
having
been
rather
interested
in
the
phelps
case
at
the
time
but
i
thought
the
doctors
said
finally
that
death
was
due
to
heart
failure
doctor
forden
who
signed
the
papers
said
so
corrected
andrews
heart
failure
what
does
that
mean
as
well
say
breath
failure
or
nerve
failure
i
tell
you
what
kind
of
failure
i
think
it
was
it
was
money
failure
hard
times
and
poor
investments
struck
phelps
before
he
really
knew
how
to
handle
his
small
fortune
it
called
him
home
and
pouf
he
is
off
to
leave
to
his
family
a
cool
by
his
death
but
did
he
do
it
himself
or
did
some
one
else
do
it
the
question
what
is
your
theory
inquired
kennedy
absently
assuming
there
is
no
scandal
hidden
in
the
life
of
phelps
before
or
after
he
married
the
russian
dancer
i
do
know
kennedy
confessed
andrews
i
have
had
so
many
theories
and
have
changed
them
so
rapidly
that
all
i
lay
claim
to
believing
outside
of
the
bald
facts
that
i
have
stated
is
that
there
must
have
been
some
poison
i
rather
sense
it
feel
that
there
is
no
doubt
of
it
in
fact
that
is
why
i
have
come
to
you
i
want
you
to
clear
it
up
one
way
or
another
the
company
has
no
interest
except
in
getting
at
the
truth
the
body
is
really
there
asked
kennedy
you
saw
it
it
was
there
no
later
than
this
afternoon
and
in
an
almost
perfect
state
of
preservation
too
kennedy
seemed
to
be
looking
at
and
through
andrews
as
if
he
would
hypnotise
the
truth
out
of
him
let
me
see
he
said
quickly
it
is
not
very
late
now
can
we
visit
the
mausoleum
easily
my
car
is
woodbine
is
not
far
and
you
find
it
a
very
attractive
suburb
aside
from
this
mystery
andrews
lost
no
time
in
getting
us
out
to
woodbine
and
on
the
fringe
of
the
little
town
one
of
the
wealthiest
around
the
city
he
deposited
us
at
the
least
likely
place
of
all
the
cemetery
a
visit
to
a
cemetery
is
none
too
enjoyable
even
on
a
bright
day
in
the
early
night
it
is
positively
uncanny
what
was
gruesome
in
the
daylight
became
doubly
so
under
the
shroud
of
darkness
we
made
our
way
into
the
grounds
through
a
gate
and
i
at
least
even
with
all
the
enlightenment
of
modern
science
could
not
restrain
a
weird
and
creepy
sensation
here
is
the
phelps
tomb
directed
andrews
pausing
beside
a
marble
structure
of
grecian
lines
and
pulling
out
a
duplicate
key
of
a
new
lock
which
had
been
placed
on
the
heavy
door
of
grated
iron
as
we
entered
it
was
with
a
shudder
at
the
damp
odour
of
decay
kennedy
had
brought
his
little
electric
and
as
he
flashed
it
about
we
could
see
at
a
glance
that
the
reports
had
not
been
exaggerated
everything
showed
marks
of
a
struggle
some
of
the
ornaments
had
been
broken
and
the
coffin
itself
had
been
forced
open
i
have
had
things
kept
just
as
we
found
them
explained
andrews
kennedy
peered
into
the
broken
coffin
long
and
attentively
with
a
little
effort
i
too
followed
the
course
of
the
circle
of
light
the
body
was
as
andrews
had
said
in
an
excellent
indeed
a
perfect
state
of
preservation
there
were
strange
to
say
no
marks
of
decay
strange
very
strange
muttered
kennedy
to
himself
could
it
have
been
some
medical
students
i
asked
musingly
or
was
it
simply
a
piece
of
vandalism
i
wonder
if
there
could
have
been
any
jewels
buried
with
him
as
shaughnessy
said
that
would
make
the
motive
plain
robbery
there
were
no
jewels
said
andrews
his
mind
not
on
the
first
part
of
my
question
but
watching
kennedy
intently
craig
had
dropped
on
his
knees
on
the
damp
mildewed
floor
and
bringing
his
close
to
the
stones
was
examining
some
spots
here
and
there
there
could
not
have
been
any
substitution
i
whispered
with
my
mind
still
on
the
broken
coffin
that
would
cover
up
the
evidence
of
a
poisoning
you
know
no
replied
andrews
positively
although
bodies
can
be
obtained
cheaply
enough
from
a
morgue
ostensibly
for
medical
purposes
no
that
is
phelps
all
right
well
then
i
persisted
medical
students
not
likely
for
the
same
reason
he
rejected
we
bent
over
closer
to
watch
kennedy
apparently
he
had
found
a
number
of
round
flat
spots
with
little
spatters
beside
them
he
was
carefully
trying
to
scrape
them
up
with
as
little
of
the
surrounding
mould
as
possible
suddenly
without
warning
there
was
a
noise
outside
as
if
a
person
were
moving
through
the
underbrush
it
was
fearsome
in
its
suddenness
was
it
human
or
wraith
kennedy
darted
to
the
door
in
time
to
see
a
shadow
glide
silently
away
lost
in
the
darkness
of
the
fine
old
willows
some
one
had
approached
the
mausoleum
for
a
second
time
not
knowing
we
were
there
and
had
escaped
down
the
road
we
could
hear
the
purr
of
an
almost
silent
motor
somebody
is
trying
to
get
in
to
conceal
something
here
muttered
kennedy
stifling
his
disappointment
at
not
getting
a
closer
view
of
the
intruder
then
it
was
not
a
suicide
i
exclaimed
it
was
a
murder
craig
shook
his
head
sententiously
evidently
he
not
prepared
yet
to
talk
with
another
look
at
the
body
in
the
broken
casket
he
remarked
i
want
to
call
on
phelps
and
doctor
forden
and
if
it
is
possible
to
find
him
dana
phelps
meanwhile
andrews
if
you
and
walter
will
stand
guard
here
there
is
an
apparatus
which
i
should
like
to
get
from
my
laboratory
and
set
up
here
before
it
is
too
late
it
was
far
past
the
witching
hour
of
midnight
when
graveyards
proverbially
yawn
before
craig
returned
in
the
car
nothing
had
happened
in
the
meantime
except
those
usual
eery
noises
that
one
may
hear
in
the
country
at
night
anywhere
our
visitor
of
the
early
evening
seemed
to
have
been
scared
away
for
good
inside
the
mausoleum
kennedy
set
up
a
peculiar
machine
which
he
attached
to
the
circuit
in
the
street
by
a
long
wire
which
he
ran
loosely
over
the
ground
part
of
the
apparatus
consisted
of
an
elongated
box
lined
with
lead
to
which
were
several
other
attachments
the
nature
of
which
i
did
not
understand
and
a
what
that
asked
andrews
curiously
as
craig
set
up
a
screen
between
the
apparatus
and
the
body
this
is
a
screen
remarked
kennedy
adjusting
now
what
i
know
to
be
a
crookes
tube
on
the
other
side
of
the
body
itself
so
that
the
order
was
the
tube
the
body
the
screen
and
the
oblong
box
without
a
further
word
we
continued
to
watch
him
at
last
the
apparatus
adjusted
apparently
to
his
satisfaction
he
brought
out
a
jar
of
thick
white
liquid
and
a
bottle
of
powder
buttermilk
and
a
couple
of
ounces
of
bismuth
he
remarked
as
he
mixed
some
in
a
glass
and
with
a
pump
forced
it
down
the
throat
of
the
body
now
lying
so
that
the
abdomen
was
almost
flat
against
the
screen
he
turned
a
switch
and
the
peculiar
bluish
effulgence
which
always
appears
when
a
crookes
tube
is
being
used
burst
forth
accompanied
by
the
droning
of
his
and
the
welcome
smell
of
ozone
produced
by
the
electrical
discharge
in
the
almost
fetid
air
of
the
tomb
meanwhile
he
was
gradually
turning
the
handle
of
the
crank
attached
to
the
oblong
box
he
seemed
so
engrossed
in
the
delicateness
of
the
operation
that
we
did
not
question
him
in
fact
did
not
move
for
andrews
at
least
it
was
enough
to
know
that
he
had
succeeded
in
enlisting
kennedy
services
well
along
toward
morning
it
was
before
kennedy
had
concluded
his
tests
whatever
they
were
and
had
packed
away
his
paraphernalia
i
afraid
it
will
take
me
two
or
three
days
to
get
at
this
evidence
even
now
he
remarked
impatient
at
even
the
limitations
science
put
on
his
activity
we
had
started
back
for
a
quick
run
to
the
city
and
rest
but
anyhow
it
will
give
us
a
chance
to
do
some
investigating
along
other
lines
early
the
next
day
in
spite
of
the
late
session
of
the
night
before
kennedy
started
me
with
him
on
a
second
visit
to
woodbine
this
time
he
was
armed
with
a
letter
of
introduction
from
andrews
to
phelps
she
proved
to
be
a
young
woman
of
most
extraordinary
grace
and
beauty
with
a
superb
carriage
such
as
only
years
of
closest
training
under
the
best
dancers
of
the
world
could
give
there
was
a
peculiar
velvety
softness
about
her
flesh
and
skin
a
witching
stoop
to
her
shoulders
that
was
decidedly
continental
and
in
her
deep
soulful
eyes
a
look
that
was
most
alluring
in
fact
she
was
as
attractive
a
widow
as
the
best
fifth
avenue
dealers
in
mourning
goods
could
have
produced
i
knew
that
phelps
had
been
both
as
dancer
and
wife
always
the
centre
of
a
group
of
actors
artists
and
men
of
letters
as
well
as
of
the
world
and
affairs
the
phelpses
had
lived
well
although
they
were
not
extremely
wealthy
as
fortunes
go
when
the
blow
fell
i
could
well
fancy
that
the
loss
of
his
money
had
been
most
serious
to
young
montague
who
had
showered
everything
as
lavishly
as
he
was
able
upon
his
captivating
bride
phelps
did
not
seem
to
be
overjoyed
at
receiving
us
yet
made
no
open
effort
to
refuse
how
long
ago
did
the
coma
first
show
itself
asked
kennedy
after
our
introductions
were
completed
was
your
husband
a
man
of
neurotic
tendency
as
far
as
you
could
judge
oh
i
could
say
when
it
began
she
answered
in
a
voice
that
was
soft
and
musical
and
under
perfect
control
the
doctor
would
know
that
better
no
he
was
not
neurotic
i
think
did
you
ever
see
phelps
take
any
drugs
not
habitually
but
just
before
this
sleep
came
on
kennedy
was
seeking
his
information
in
a
manner
and
tone
that
would
cause
as
little
offence
as
possible
oh
no
she
hastened
no
never
absolutely
you
called
in
forden
the
last
night
yes
he
had
been
montague
physician
many
years
ago
you
know
i
see
remarked
kennedy
who
was
thrusting
about
aimlessly
to
get
her
off
her
guard
by
the
way
you
know
there
is
a
great
deal
of
gossip
about
the
almost
perfect
state
of
preservation
of
the
body
phelps
i
see
it
was
not
embalmed
she
bit
her
lip
and
looked
at
kennedy
sharply
why
why
do
you
and
andrews
worry
me
ca
you
see
doctor
forden
in
her
annoyance
i
fancied
that
there
was
a
surprising
lack
of
sorrow
she
seemed
preoccupied
i
could
not
escape
the
feeling
that
she
was
putting
some
obstacle
in
our
way
or
that
from
the
day
of
the
discovery
of
the
vandalism
some
one
had
been
making
an
effort
to
keep
the
real
facts
concealed
was
she
shielding
some
one
it
flashed
over
me
that
perhaps
after
all
she
had
submitted
to
the
blackmail
and
had
buried
the
money
at
the
appointed
place
there
seemed
to
be
little
use
in
pursuing
the
inquiry
so
we
excused
ourselves
much
i
thought
to
her
relief
we
found
doctor
forden
who
lived
on
the
same
street
as
the
phelpses
several
squares
away
most
fortunately
at
home
forden
was
an
extremely
interesting
man
as
is
indeed
the
rule
with
physicians
i
could
not
but
fancy
however
that
his
hearty
assurance
that
he
would
be
glad
to
talk
freely
on
the
case
was
somewhat
forced
you
were
sent
for
by
phelps
that
last
night
i
believe
while
phelps
was
still
alive
asked
kennedy
yes
during
the
day
it
had
been
impossible
to
arouse
him
and
that
night
when
phelps
and
the
nurse
found
him
sinking
even
deeper
into
the
comatose
state
i
was
summoned
again
he
was
beyond
hope
then
i
did
everything
i
could
but
he
died
a
few
moments
after
i
arrived
did
you
try
artificial
respiration
asked
kennedy
replied
forden
i
telephoned
here
for
my
respirator
but
by
the
time
it
arrived
at
the
house
it
was
too
late
nothing
had
been
omitted
while
he
was
still
struggling
with
the
spark
of
life
when
that
went
out
what
was
the
use
you
were
his
personal
physician
yes
had
you
ever
noticed
that
he
took
any
drug
doctor
forden
shot
a
quick
glance
at
kennedy
of
course
not
he
was
not
a
drug
fiend
i
did
mean
that
he
was
addicted
to
any
drug
but
had
he
taken
anything
lately
either
of
his
own
volition
or
with
the
advice
or
knowledge
of
any
one
else
of
course
not
there
another
strange
thing
i
wish
to
ask
your
opinion
about
pursued
kennedy
not
to
be
rebuffed
i
have
seen
his
body
it
is
in
an
excellent
state
of
preservation
almost
lifelike
and
yet
i
understand
or
at
least
it
seems
that
it
was
not
embalmed
you
have
to
ask
the
undertaker
about
that
answered
the
doctor
brusquely
it
was
evident
that
he
was
getting
more
and
more
constrained
in
his
answers
kennedy
did
not
seem
to
mind
it
but
to
me
it
seemed
that
he
must
be
hiding
something
was
there
some
secret
which
medical
ethics
kept
locked
in
his
breast
kennedy
had
risen
and
excused
himself
the
interviews
had
not
resulted
in
much
i
felt
yet
kennedy
did
not
seem
to
care
back
in
the
city
again
he
buried
himself
in
his
laboratory
for
the
rest
of
the
day
most
of
the
time
in
his
dark
room
where
he
was
developing
photographic
plates
or
films
i
did
not
know
which
during
the
afternoon
andrews
dropped
in
for
a
few
moments
to
report
that
he
had
nothing
to
add
to
what
had
already
developed
he
was
not
much
impressed
by
the
interviews
there
just
one
thing
i
want
to
speak
about
though
he
said
at
length
unburdening
his
mind
that
tomb
and
the
swamp
too
ought
to
be
watched
last
night
showed
me
that
there
seems
to
be
a
regular
nocturnal
visitor
and
that
we
can
not
depend
on
that
town
night
watchman
to
scare
him
off
yet
if
we
watch
up
there
he
will
be
warned
and
will
lie
low
how
can
we
watch
both
places
at
once
and
yet
remain
hidden
kennedy
nodded
approval
of
the
suggestion
i
fix
that
he
replied
anxious
to
return
to
his
photographic
labours
meet
me
both
of
you
on
the
road
from
the
station
at
woodbine
just
as
it
is
getting
dusk
without
another
word
he
disappeared
into
the
dark
room
we
met
him
that
night
as
he
had
requested
he
had
come
up
to
woodbine
in
the
of
the
train
with
a
powerful
dog
for
all
the
world
like
a
huge
grey
wolf
down
schaef
he
ordered
as
the
dog
began
to
show
an
uncanny
interest
in
me
let
me
introduce
my
new
he
chuckled
she
has
a
wonderful
record
as
a
we
were
making
our
way
now
through
the
thickening
shadows
of
the
town
to
the
outskirts
she
a
german
a
schaferhund
he
explained
for
my
part
it
is
the
english
bloodhound
in
the
open
country
and
the
in
the
city
and
the
suburbs
schaef
seemed
to
have
many
of
the
characteristics
of
the
wild
prehistoric
animal
among
them
the
full
upright
ears
of
the
wild
dog
which
are
such
a
great
help
to
it
she
was
a
fine
alert
upstanding
dog
hardy
fierce
and
literally
untiring
of
a
tawny
light
brown
like
a
lioness
about
the
same
size
and
somewhat
of
the
type
of
the
collie
broad
of
chest
and
with
a
full
brush
of
tail
untamed
though
she
seemed
she
was
perfectly
under
kennedy
control
and
rendered
him
absolute
and
unreasoning
obedience
at
the
cemetery
we
established
a
strict
watch
about
the
phelps
mausoleum
and
the
swamp
which
lay
across
the
road
not
a
difficult
thing
to
do
as
far
as
concealment
went
owing
to
the
foliage
still
for
the
same
reason
it
was
hard
to
cover
the
whole
ground
in
the
shadow
of
a
thicket
we
waited
now
and
then
we
could
hear
schaef
scouting
about
in
the
underbrush
crouching
and
hiding
watching
and
guarding
as
the
hours
of
waiting
in
the
heavily
laden
night
air
wore
on
i
wondered
whether
our
vigil
in
this
weird
place
would
be
rewarded
the
soughing
of
the
night
wind
in
the
evergreens
mournful
at
best
was
doubly
so
now
hour
after
hour
we
waited
patiently
at
last
there
was
a
slight
noise
from
the
direction
opposite
the
mausoleum
and
toward
the
swamp
next
to
the
cemetery
kennedy
reached
out
and
drew
us
back
into
the
shadow
deeper
some
one
is
prowling
about
approaching
the
mausoleum
on
that
side
i
think
he
whispered
instantly
there
recurred
to
me
the
thought
i
had
had
earlier
in
the
day
that
perhaps
after
all
the
five
thousand
dollars
of
hush
money
for
whatever
purpose
it
might
be
extorted
had
been
buried
in
the
swamp
by
phelps
in
her
anxiety
had
that
been
what
she
was
concealing
perhaps
the
blackmailer
had
come
to
reconnoitre
and
if
the
money
was
there
to
take
it
away
schaef
who
had
been
near
us
was
sniffing
eagerly
from
our
we
could
just
see
her
she
had
heard
the
sounds
too
even
before
we
had
and
for
an
instant
stood
with
every
muscle
tense
then
like
an
arrow
she
darted
into
the
underbrush
an
instant
later
the
sharp
crack
of
a
revolver
rang
out
schaef
kept
right
on
never
stopping
a
second
except
perhaps
for
surprise
crack
almost
in
her
face
came
a
second
spit
of
fire
in
the
darkness
and
a
bullet
crashed
through
the
leaves
and
buried
itself
in
a
tree
with
a
ping
the
intruder
marksmanship
was
poor
but
the
dog
paid
no
attention
to
it
one
of
the
few
animals
that
show
no
fear
of
gunfire
muttered
kennedy
in
undisguised
admiration
we
heard
from
the
she
has
made
a
leap
at
the
hand
that
holds
the
gun
cried
kennedy
now
rising
and
moving
rapidly
in
the
same
direction
she
has
been
taught
that
a
man
once
badly
bitten
in
the
hand
is
nearly
out
of
the
fight
we
followed
too
as
we
approached
we
were
just
in
time
to
see
schaef
running
in
and
out
between
the
legs
of
a
man
who
had
heard
us
approach
and
was
hastily
making
tracks
for
the
road
as
he
tripped
she
lunged
for
his
back
kennedy
blew
shrilly
on
a
police
whistle
reluctantly
schaef
let
go
one
could
see
that
with
all
her
canine
instinct
she
wanted
to
get
that
man
her
jaws
were
open
as
with
longing
eyes
she
stood
over
the
prostrate
form
in
the
grass
the
whistle
was
a
signal
and
she
had
been
taught
to
obey
unquestioningly
do
move
until
we
get
to
you
or
you
are
a
dead
man
shouted
kennedy
pulling
an
automatic
as
he
ran
are
you
hurt
there
was
no
answer
but
as
we
approached
the
man
moved
ever
so
little
through
curiosity
to
see
his
pursuers
schaef
shot
forward
again
the
whistle
sounded
and
she
dropped
back
we
bent
over
to
seize
him
as
kennedy
secured
the
dog
she
a
devil
ground
out
the
prone
figure
on
the
grass
dana
phelps
exclaimed
andrews
as
the
man
turned
his
face
toward
us
what
are
you
doing
mixed
up
in
this
suddenly
there
was
a
movement
in
the
rear
toward
the
mausoleum
itself
we
turned
but
it
was
too
late
two
dark
figures
slunk
through
the
gloom
bearing
something
between
them
kennedy
slipped
the
leash
off
schaef
and
she
shot
out
like
a
unchained
bolt
of
lightning
there
was
the
whir
of
a
machine
which
must
have
sneaked
up
with
the
muffler
on
during
the
excitement
they
had
taken
a
desperate
chance
and
had
succeeded
they
were
gone
xxii
the
movies
still
holding
dana
phelps
between
us
we
hurried
toward
the
tomb
and
entered
while
our
attention
had
been
diverted
in
the
direction
of
the
swamp
the
body
of
montague
phelps
had
been
stolen
dana
phelps
was
still
deliberately
brushing
off
his
clothes
had
he
been
in
league
with
them
executing
a
flank
movement
to
divert
our
attention
or
had
it
all
been
pure
chance
well
demanded
andrews
well
replied
dana
kennedy
said
nothing
and
i
felt
that
with
our
capture
the
mystery
seemed
to
have
deepened
rather
than
cleared
as
andrews
and
phelps
faced
each
other
i
noticed
that
the
latter
was
now
and
then
endeavouring
to
cover
his
wrist
where
the
dog
had
torn
his
coat
sleeve
are
you
hurt
badly
inquired
kennedy
dana
said
nothing
but
backed
away
kennedy
advanced
insisting
on
looking
at
the
wounds
as
he
looked
he
disclosed
a
semicircle
of
marks
not
a
dog
bite
he
whispered
turning
to
me
and
fumbling
in
his
pocket
besides
those
marks
are
a
couple
of
days
old
they
have
scabs
on
them
he
had
pulled
out
a
pencil
and
a
piece
of
paper
and
unknown
to
phelps
was
writing
in
the
darkness
i
leaned
over
near
the
point
in
the
tube
through
which
the
point
for
writing
was
protruded
a
small
accumulator
and
tiny
electric
lamp
which
threw
a
little
disc
of
light
so
small
that
it
could
be
hidden
by
the
hand
yet
quite
sufficient
to
guide
craig
in
moving
the
point
of
his
pencil
for
the
proper
formation
of
whatever
he
was
recording
on
the
surface
of
the
paper
an
pencil
he
remarked
laconically
in
an
undertone
who
were
the
others
demanded
andrews
of
dana
there
was
a
pause
as
though
he
were
debating
whether
or
not
to
answer
at
all
i
do
know
he
said
at
length
i
wish
i
did
you
do
know
queried
andrews
with
incredulity
no
i
say
i
wish
i
did
know
you
and
your
dog
interrupted
me
just
as
i
was
about
to
find
out
too
we
looked
at
each
other
in
amazement
andrews
was
frankly
skeptical
of
the
coolness
of
the
young
man
kennedy
said
nothing
for
some
moments
i
see
you
do
want
to
talk
he
put
in
shortly
nothing
to
talk
about
grunted
dana
in
disgust
then
why
are
you
here
nothing
but
conjecture
no
facts
only
suspicions
said
dana
half
to
himself
you
expect
us
to
believe
that
insinuated
andrews
i
ca
help
what
you
believe
that
is
the
fact
and
you
were
not
with
them
no
you
be
within
call
if
we
let
you
go
now
any
time
that
we
want
you
interrupted
kennedy
much
to
the
surprise
of
andrews
i
shall
stay
in
woodbine
as
long
as
there
is
any
hope
of
clearing
up
this
case
if
you
want
me
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
stay
anyhow
even
if
there
is
a
clue
somewhere
else
i
take
your
word
for
it
offered
kennedy
i
give
it
i
must
say
that
i
rather
liked
the
young
chap
although
i
could
make
nothing
out
of
him
as
dana
phelps
disappeared
down
the
road
andrews
turned
to
kennedy
what
did
you
do
that
for
he
asked
half
critically
because
we
can
watch
him
anyway
answered
craig
with
a
significant
glance
at
the
now
empty
casket
have
him
shadowed
andrews
it
may
lead
to
something
and
it
may
not
but
in
any
case
do
let
him
get
out
of
reach
here
we
are
in
a
worse
mystery
than
ever
grumbled
andrews
we
have
caught
a
prisoner
but
the
body
is
gone
and
we
ca
even
show
that
he
was
an
accomplice
what
were
you
writing
i
asked
craig
endeavouring
to
change
the
subject
to
one
more
promising
just
copying
the
peculiar
shape
of
those
marks
on
phelps
arm
perhaps
we
can
improve
on
the
method
of
identification
those
were
the
marks
of
human
teeth
he
was
glancing
casually
at
his
sketch
as
he
displayed
it
to
us
i
wondered
whether
he
really
expected
to
obtain
proof
of
the
identity
of
at
least
one
of
the
ghouls
by
the
it
shows
eight
teeth
one
of
them
decayed
he
remarked
by
the
way
there
no
use
watching
here
any
longer
i
have
some
more
work
to
do
in
the
laboratory
which
will
keep
me
another
day
night
i
shall
be
ready
andrews
in
the
mean
time
i
leave
the
shadowing
of
dana
to
you
and
with
the
help
of
jameson
i
want
you
to
arrange
to
have
all
those
connected
with
the
case
at
my
laboratory
night
without
fail
andrews
and
i
had
to
do
some
clever
scheming
to
bring
pressure
to
bear
on
the
various
persons
interested
to
insure
their
attendance
now
that
craig
was
ready
to
act
of
course
there
was
no
difficulty
in
getting
dana
phelps
andrews
shadows
reported
nothing
in
his
actions
of
the
following
day
that
indicated
anything
phelps
came
down
to
town
by
train
and
doctor
forden
motored
in
andrews
even
took
the
precaution
to
secure
shaughnessy
and
the
trained
nurse
miss
tracy
who
had
been
with
montague
phelps
during
his
illness
but
had
not
contributed
anything
toward
untangling
the
case
andrews
and
myself
completed
the
little
audience
we
found
kennedy
heating
a
large
mass
of
some
composition
such
as
dentists
use
in
taking
impressions
of
the
teeth
i
shall
be
ready
in
a
moment
he
excused
himself
still
bending
over
his
bunsen
flame
by
the
way
phelps
if
you
will
permit
me
he
had
detached
a
wad
of
the
softened
material
phelps
taken
by
surprise
allowed
him
to
make
an
impression
of
his
teeth
almost
before
he
realised
what
kennedy
was
doing
the
precedent
set
so
to
speak
kennedy
approached
doctor
forden
he
demurred
but
finally
consented
phelps
followed
then
the
nurse
and
even
shaughnessy
with
a
quick
glance
at
each
impression
kennedy
laid
them
aside
to
harden
i
am
ready
to
begin
he
remarked
at
length
turning
to
a
peculiar
looking
instrument
something
like
three
telescopes
pointing
at
a
centre
in
which
was
a
series
of
glass
prisms
these
five
senses
of
ours
are
pretty
dull
detectives
sometimes
kennedy
began
but
i
find
that
when
we
are
able
to
call
in
outside
aid
we
usually
find
that
there
are
no
more
mysteries
he
placed
something
in
a
in
line
before
one
of
the
barrels
of
the
telescopes
near
a
brilliant
electric
light
what
do
you
see
walter
he
asked
indicating
an
eyepiece
i
looked
a
series
of
lines
i
replied
what
is
it
that
he
explained
is
a
spectroscope
and
those
are
the
lines
of
the
absorption
spectrum
each
of
those
lines
by
its
presence
denotes
a
different
substance
now
on
the
pavement
of
the
phelps
mausoleum
i
found
you
will
recall
some
roundish
spots
i
have
made
a
very
diluted
solution
of
them
which
is
placed
in
this
tube
the
applicability
of
the
spectroscope
to
the
differentiation
of
various
substances
is
too
well
known
to
need
explanation
its
value
lies
in
the
exact
nature
of
the
evidence
furnished
even
the
very
dilute
solution
which
i
have
been
able
to
make
of
the
material
scraped
from
these
spots
gives
characteristic
absorption
bands
between
the
d
and
e
lines
as
they
are
called
their
are
between
and
it
is
such
a
distinct
absorption
spectrum
that
it
is
possible
to
determine
with
certainty
that
the
fluid
actually
contains
a
certain
substance
even
though
the
microscope
might
fail
to
give
sure
proof
blood
human
blood
that
was
what
those
stains
were
he
paused
the
spectra
of
the
blood
pigments
he
added
of
the
extremely
minute
quantities
of
blood
and
the
decomposition
products
of
hemoglobin
in
the
blood
are
here
infallibly
shown
varying
very
distinctly
with
the
chemical
changes
which
the
pigments
may
undergo
whose
blood
was
it
i
asked
myself
was
it
of
some
one
who
had
visited
the
tomb
who
was
surprised
there
or
surprised
some
one
else
there
i
was
hardly
ready
for
kennedy
quick
remark
there
were
two
kinds
of
blood
there
one
was
contained
in
the
spots
on
the
floor
all
about
the
mausoleum
there
are
marks
on
the
arm
of
dana
phelps
which
he
probably
might
say
were
made
by
the
teeth
of
my
schaef
they
are
human
however
he
was
bitten
by
some
one
in
a
struggle
it
was
his
blood
on
the
floor
of
the
mausoleum
whose
were
the
teeth
kennedy
fingered
the
now
set
impressions
then
resumed
before
i
answer
that
question
what
else
does
the
spectroscope
show
i
found
some
spots
near
the
coffin
which
has
been
broken
open
by
a
heavy
object
it
had
slipped
and
had
injured
the
body
of
montague
phelps
from
the
injury
some
drops
had
oozed
my
spectroscope
tells
me
that
that
too
is
blood
the
blood
and
other
muscular
and
nervous
fluids
of
the
body
had
remained
in
an
aqueous
condition
instead
of
becoming
pectous
that
is
a
remarkable
circumstance
it
flashed
over
me
what
kennedy
had
been
driving
at
in
his
inquiry
regarding
embalming
if
the
poisons
of
the
embalming
fluid
had
not
been
injected
he
had
now
clear
proof
regarding
anything
his
spectroscope
discovered
i
had
expected
to
find
a
poison
perhaps
an
alkaloid
he
continued
slowly
as
he
outlined
his
discoveries
by
the
use
of
one
of
the
most
fascinating
branches
of
modern
science
spectroscopy
in
cases
of
poisoning
by
these
substances
the
spectroscope
often
has
obvious
advantages
over
chemical
methods
for
minute
amounts
will
produce
a
spectrum
the
spectroscope
the
substance
to
use
a
police
idiom
the
moment
the
case
is
turned
over
to
it
there
was
no
poison
there
he
had
raised
his
voice
to
emphasise
the
startling
revelation
instead
i
found
an
extraordinary
amount
of
the
substance
and
products
of
glycogen
the
liver
where
this
substance
is
stored
is
literally
surcharged
in
the
body
of
phelps
he
had
started
his
machine
here
i
have
one
of
the
latest
developments
in
the
art
he
resumed
an
moving
picture
a
feat
which
was
until
recently
visionary
a
science
now
in
its
infancy
bearing
the
formidable
names
of
biorontgenography
or
kinematoradiography
kennedy
was
holding
his
little
audience
breathless
as
he
proceeded
i
fancied
i
could
see
anginette
phelps
give
a
little
shudder
at
the
prospect
of
looking
into
the
very
interior
of
a
human
body
but
she
was
pale
with
the
fascination
of
it
neither
forden
nor
the
nurse
looked
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
dana
phelps
was
with
wonder
in
one
photograph
or
even
in
several
continued
kennedy
it
is
difficult
to
discover
slight
motions
not
so
in
a
moving
picture
for
instance
here
i
have
a
picture
which
will
show
you
a
living
body
in
all
its
moving
details
on
the
screen
before
us
was
projected
a
huge
shadowgraph
of
a
chest
and
abdomen
we
could
see
the
vertebrae
of
the
spinal
column
the
ribs
and
the
various
organs
it
is
difficult
to
get
a
series
of
photographs
directly
from
a
fluorescent
screen
kennedy
went
on
i
overcome
the
difficulty
by
having
lenses
of
sufficient
rapidity
to
photograph
even
faint
images
on
that
screen
it
is
better
than
the
serial
method
by
which
a
number
of
separate
pictures
are
taken
and
then
pieced
together
and
rephotographed
to
make
the
film
i
can
focus
the
first
on
the
screen
by
means
of
a
special
quartz
objective
which
i
have
devised
then
i
take
the
pictures
here
you
see
are
the
lungs
in
slow
or
rapid
respiration
there
is
the
rhythmically
beating
heart
distinctly
pulsating
in
perfect
outline
there
is
the
liver
moving
up
and
down
with
the
diaphragm
the
intestines
and
the
stomach
you
can
see
the
bones
moving
with
the
limbs
as
well
as
the
inner
visceral
life
all
that
is
hidden
to
the
eye
by
the
flesh
is
now
made
visible
in
striking
manner
never
have
i
seen
an
audience
at
the
movies
so
thrilled
as
we
were
now
as
kennedy
swayed
our
interest
at
his
will
i
had
been
dividing
my
attention
between
kennedy
and
the
extraordinary
beauty
of
the
famous
russian
dancer
i
forgot
anginette
phelps
entirely
kennedy
placed
another
film
in
the
holder
you
are
now
looking
into
the
body
of
montague
phelps
he
announced
suddenly
we
leaned
forward
eagerly
phelps
gave
a
gasp
what
was
the
secret
hidden
in
it
there
was
the
stomach
a
curved
sack
something
like
a
bagpipe
or
a
badly
made
boot
with
a
tiny
canal
at
the
toe
connecting
it
with
the
small
intestine
there
were
the
heart
and
lungs
i
have
rendered
the
stomach
visible
resumed
kennedy
made
it
so
to
speak
by
injecting
a
solution
of
bismuth
in
buttermilk
the
usual
method
by
which
it
becomes
more
impervious
to
the
and
hence
darker
in
the
skiagraph
i
took
these
pictures
not
at
the
rate
of
fourteen
or
so
a
second
like
the
others
but
at
intervals
of
a
few
seconds
i
did
that
so
that
when
i
run
them
off
i
get
a
sort
of
compressed
moving
picture
what
you
see
in
a
short
space
of
time
actually
took
much
longer
to
occur
i
could
have
either
kind
of
picture
but
i
prefer
the
latter
for
you
will
take
notice
that
there
is
movement
here
of
the
heart
of
the
lungs
of
the
stomach
faint
imperceptible
under
ordinary
circumstances
but
nevertheless
movement
he
was
pointing
at
the
lungs
a
single
peristaltic
contraction
takes
place
normally
in
a
very
few
seconds
here
it
takes
minutes
and
the
stomach
notice
what
the
bismuth
mixture
shows
there
is
a
very
slow
series
of
regular
from
the
fundus
to
the
pylorus
ordinarily
one
wave
takes
ten
seconds
to
traverse
it
here
it
is
so
slow
as
almost
to
be
unnoticed
what
was
the
implication
of
his
startling
almost
gruesome
discovery
i
saw
it
clearly
yet
hung
on
his
words
afraid
to
admit
even
to
myself
the
logical
interpretation
of
what
i
saw
reconstruct
the
case
continued
craig
excitedly
phelps
always
a
bon
vivant
and
now
so
situated
by
marriage
that
he
must
be
so
comes
back
to
america
to
find
his
personal
fortune
gone
what
was
left
he
did
as
many
have
done
he
took
out
a
new
large
policy
on
his
life
how
was
he
to
profit
by
it
others
have
committed
suicide
have
died
to
win
cases
are
common
now
where
men
have
ended
their
lives
under
such
circumstances
by
swallowing
tablets
a
favourite
method
it
seems
lately
but
phelps
did
not
want
to
die
to
win
life
was
too
sweet
to
him
he
had
another
scheme
kennedy
dropped
his
voice
one
of
the
most
fascinating
problems
in
speculation
as
to
the
future
of
the
race
under
the
influence
of
science
is
that
of
suspended
animation
the
usual
attitude
is
one
of
reserve
or
scepticism
there
is
no
necessity
for
it
records
exist
of
cases
where
vital
functions
have
been
practically
suspended
with
no
food
and
little
air
every
day
science
is
getting
closer
to
the
control
of
metabolism
in
the
trance
the
body
functions
are
so
slowed
as
to
simulate
death
you
have
heard
of
the
indian
fakirs
who
bury
themselves
alive
and
are
dug
up
days
later
you
have
doubted
it
but
there
is
nothing
improbable
in
it
experiments
have
been
made
with
toads
which
have
been
imprisoned
in
porous
rock
where
they
could
get
the
necessary
air
they
have
lived
for
months
in
a
stupor
in
impervious
rock
they
have
died
frozen
fish
can
revive
bears
and
other
animals
hibernate
there
are
all
gradations
from
ordinary
sleep
to
the
torpor
of
death
science
can
slow
down
almost
to
a
standstill
the
vital
processes
so
that
excretions
disappear
and
respiration
and
are
almost
nil
what
the
indian
fakir
does
in
a
cataleptic
condition
may
be
duplicated
it
is
not
incredible
that
they
may
possess
some
vegetable
extract
by
which
they
perform
their
as
yet
unexplained
feats
of
prolonged
living
burial
for
if
an
animal
free
from
disease
is
subjected
to
the
action
of
some
chemical
and
physical
agencies
which
have
the
property
of
reducing
to
the
extreme
limit
the
motor
forces
and
nervous
stimulus
the
body
of
even
a
animal
may
be
brought
down
to
a
condition
so
closely
resembling
death
that
the
most
careful
examination
may
fail
to
detect
any
signs
of
life
the
heart
will
continue
working
regularly
at
low
tension
supplying
muscles
and
other
parts
with
sufficient
blood
to
sustain
molecular
life
and
the
stomach
would
naturally
react
to
artificial
stimulus
at
any
time
before
decomposition
of
tissue
has
set
in
the
heart
might
be
made
to
resume
its
work
and
life
come
back
phelps
had
travelled
extensively
in
siberia
he
must
undoubtedly
have
heard
of
the
buriats
a
tribe
of
natives
who
hibernate
almost
like
the
animals
during
the
winters
succumbing
to
a
long
sleep
known
as
the
he
must
have
heard
of
the
experiments
of
professor
bakhmetieff
who
studied
the
buriats
and
found
that
they
subsisted
on
foods
rich
in
glycogen
a
substance
in
the
liver
which
science
has
discovered
makes
possible
life
during
suspended
animation
he
must
have
heard
of
as
the
famous
russian
calls
it
by
which
consciousness
can
be
totally
removed
and
respiration
and
digestion
cease
almost
completely
but
the
body
is
gone
some
one
interrupted
i
turned
it
was
dana
phelps
now
leaning
forward
in
excitement
yes
exclaimed
craig
time
was
passing
rapidly
the
insurance
had
not
been
paid
he
had
expected
to
be
revived
and
to
disappear
with
anginette
phelps
long
before
this
should
the
confederates
of
phelps
wait
they
did
not
dare
to
wait
longer
might
be
to
sacrifice
him
if
indeed
they
had
not
taken
a
long
chance
already
besides
you
yourself
had
your
suspicions
and
had
written
the
insurance
company
hinting
at
murder
dana
nodded
involuntarily
confessing
you
were
watching
them
as
well
as
the
insurance
investigator
andrews
it
was
an
awful
dilemma
what
was
to
be
done
he
must
be
resuscitated
at
any
risk
ah
an
idea
rifle
the
grave
that
was
the
way
to
solve
it
that
would
still
leave
it
possible
to
collect
the
insurance
too
the
blackmail
letter
about
the
five
thousand
dollars
was
only
a
blind
to
lay
on
the
mythical
black
hand
the
blame
for
the
desecration
brought
into
light
humidity
and
warmth
the
body
would
recover
consciousness
and
the
resume
their
normal
state
after
the
anabiotic
coma
into
which
phelps
had
drugged
himself
but
the
very
first
night
the
supposed
ghouls
were
discovered
dana
phelps
already
suspicious
regarding
the
death
of
his
brother
wondering
at
the
lack
of
sentiment
which
phelps
showed
since
she
felt
that
her
husband
was
not
really
dead
dana
was
there
his
suspicions
were
confirmed
he
thought
montague
had
been
in
reality
murdered
and
his
murderers
were
now
making
away
with
the
evidence
he
fought
with
the
ghouls
yet
apparently
in
the
darkness
he
did
not
discover
their
identity
the
struggle
was
bitter
but
they
were
two
to
one
dana
was
bitten
by
one
of
them
here
are
the
marks
of
teeth
teeth
of
a
woman
anginette
phelps
was
sobbing
convulsively
she
had
risen
and
was
facing
doctor
forden
with
outstretched
hands
tell
them
she
cried
wildly
forden
seemed
to
have
maintained
his
composure
only
by
a
superhuman
effort
the
body
is
at
my
office
he
said
as
we
faced
him
with
deathlike
stillness
phelps
had
told
us
to
get
him
within
ten
days
we
did
get
him
finally
gentlemen
you
who
were
seeking
murderers
are
in
effect
murderers
you
kept
us
away
two
days
too
long
it
was
too
late
we
could
not
revive
him
phelps
is
really
dead
the
deuce
exclaimed
andrews
the
policy
is
incontestible
as
he
turned
to
us
in
disgust
his
eyes
fell
on
anginette
phelps
sobered
down
by
the
terrible
tragedy
and
nearly
a
physical
wreck
from
real
grief
still
he
added
hastily
we
pay
without
a
protest
she
did
not
even
hear
him
it
seemed
that
the
butterfly
in
her
was
crushed
as
forden
and
miss
tracy
gently
led
her
away
they
had
all
left
and
the
laboratory
was
again
in
its
normal
state
of
silence
except
for
the
occasional
step
of
kennedy
as
he
stowed
away
the
apparatus
he
had
used
i
must
say
that
i
was
one
of
the
most
surprised
in
the
room
at
the
outcome
of
that
case
i
confessed
at
length
i
fully
expected
an
arrest
he
said
nothing
but
went
on
methodically
restoring
his
apparatus
to
its
proper
place
what
a
peculiar
life
you
lead
craig
i
pursued
reflectively
one
day
it
is
a
case
that
ends
with
such
a
bright
spot
in
our
lives
as
the
recollection
of
the
shirleys
the
next
goes
to
the
other
extreme
of
gruesomeness
and
one
can
hardly
think
about
it
without
a
shudder
and
then
through
it
all
you
go
with
the
high
speed
power
of
a
racing
motor
that
last
case
appealed
to
me
like
many
others
he
ruminated
just
because
it
was
so
unusual
so
gruesome
as
you
call
it
he
reached
into
the
pocket
of
his
coat
hung
over
the
back
of
a
chair
now
here
another
most
unusual
case
apparently
it
begins
really
at
the
other
end
so
to
speak
with
the
conviction
begins
at
the
very
place
where
we
detectives
send
a
man
as
the
last
act
of
our
little
dramas
what
i
gasped
another
case
before
even
this
one
is
fairly
cleaned
up
craig
you
are
impossible
you
get
worse
instead
of
better
read
it
he
said
simply
kennedy
handed
me
a
letter
in
the
angular
hand
affected
by
many
women
it
was
dated
at
sing
sing
or
rather
ossining
craig
seemed
to
appreciate
the
surprise
which
my
face
must
have
betrayed
at
the
curious
combination
of
circumstances
nearly
always
there
is
the
wife
or
mother
of
a
condemned
man
who
lives
in
the
shadow
of
the
prison
he
remarked
quietly
adding
where
she
can
look
down
at
the
grim
walls
hoping
and
fearing
i
said
nothing
for
the
letter
spoke
for
itself
i
have
read
of
your
success
as
a
scientific
detective
and
hope
that
you
will
pardon
me
for
writing
to
you
but
it
is
a
matter
of
life
or
death
for
one
who
is
dearer
to
me
than
all
the
world
perhaps
you
recall
reading
of
the
trial
and
conviction
of
my
husband
sanford
godwin
at
east
point
the
case
did
not
attract
much
attention
in
new
york
papers
although
he
was
defended
by
an
able
lawyer
from
the
city
since
the
trial
i
have
taken
up
my
residence
here
in
ossining
in
order
to
be
near
him
as
i
write
i
can
see
the
cold
grey
walls
of
the
state
prison
that
holds
all
that
is
dear
to
me
day
after
day
i
have
watched
and
waited
hoped
against
hope
the
courts
are
so
slow
and
lawyers
are
so
technical
there
have
been
executions
since
i
came
here
too
and
i
shudder
at
them
will
this
appeal
be
denied
also
my
husband
was
accused
of
murdering
by
poison
hemlock
they
alleged
his
adoptive
parent
the
retired
merchant
parker
godwin
whose
family
name
he
took
when
he
was
a
boy
after
the
death
of
the
old
man
a
later
will
was
discovered
in
which
my
husband
inheritance
was
reduced
to
a
small
annuity
the
other
heirs
the
elmores
asserted
and
the
state
made
out
its
case
on
the
assumption
that
the
new
will
furnished
a
motive
for
killing
old
godwin
and
that
only
by
accident
had
it
been
discovered
sanford
is
innocent
he
could
not
have
done
it
it
is
not
in
him
to
do
such
a
thing
i
am
only
a
woman
but
about
some
things
i
know
more
than
all
the
lawyers
and
scientists
and
i
know
that
he
is
innocent
i
can
not
write
all
my
heart
is
too
full
can
not
you
come
and
advise
me
even
if
you
can
not
take
up
the
case
to
which
i
have
devoted
my
life
tell
me
what
to
do
i
am
enclosing
a
check
for
expenses
all
i
can
spare
at
present
sincerely
yours
nella
godwin
are
you
going
i
asked
watching
kennedy
as
he
tapped
the
check
thoughtfully
on
the
desk
i
can
hardly
resist
an
appeal
like
that
he
replied
absently
replacing
the
check
in
the
envelope
with
the
letter
xxiii
the
death
house
in
the
early
forenoon
we
were
on
our
way
by
train
up
the
river
to
sing
sing
where
at
the
station
a
line
of
cabs
and
cabbies
greeted
us
for
the
town
itself
is
hilly
the
house
to
which
we
had
been
directed
was
on
the
hill
and
from
its
windows
one
could
look
down
on
the
pile
of
stone
with
the
evil
little
slits
of
windows
below
and
perhaps
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
there
was
no
need
to
be
told
what
it
was
its
very
atmosphere
breathed
the
word
prison
even
the
ugly
clutter
of
workshops
did
not
destroy
it
every
stone
every
grill
every
glint
of
a
rifle
spelt
prison
godwin
was
a
pale
slight
little
woman
in
whose
face
shone
an
indomitable
spirit
unconquered
even
by
the
slow
torture
of
her
lonely
vigil
except
for
such
few
hours
that
she
had
to
engage
in
her
simple
household
duties
with
now
and
then
a
short
walk
in
the
country
she
was
always
watching
that
bleak
stone
house
of
atonement
yet
though
her
spirit
was
unconquered
it
needed
no
physician
to
tell
one
that
the
dimming
of
the
lights
at
the
prison
on
the
morning
set
for
the
execution
would
fill
two
graves
instead
of
one
for
she
had
come
to
know
that
this
sudden
dimming
of
the
corridor
lights
and
then
their
almost
as
sudden
had
a
terrible
meaning
well
known
to
the
men
inside
hers
was
no
less
an
agony
than
that
of
the
men
in
the
curtained
cells
since
she
had
learned
that
when
the
lights
grow
dim
at
dawn
at
sing
sing
it
means
that
the
electric
power
has
been
borrowed
for
just
that
little
while
to
send
a
body
straining
against
the
straps
of
the
electric
chair
snuffing
out
the
life
of
a
man
she
had
evidently
been
watching
in
both
directions
watching
eagerly
the
carriages
as
they
climbed
the
hill
as
well
as
in
the
direction
of
the
prison
how
can
i
ever
thank
you
professor
kennedy
she
greeted
us
at
the
door
keeping
back
with
difficulty
the
tears
that
showed
how
much
it
meant
to
have
any
one
interest
himself
in
her
husband
case
there
was
that
gentleness
about
godwin
that
comes
only
to
those
who
have
suffered
much
it
has
been
a
long
fight
she
began
as
we
talked
in
her
modest
little
into
which
the
sun
streamed
brightly
with
no
thought
of
the
cold
shadows
in
the
grim
building
below
oh
and
such
a
hard
heartbreaking
fight
often
it
seems
as
if
we
had
exhausted
every
means
at
our
disposal
and
yet
we
shall
never
give
up
why
can
not
we
make
the
world
see
our
case
as
we
see
it
everything
seems
to
have
conspired
against
us
and
yet
i
can
not
i
will
not
believe
that
the
law
and
the
science
that
have
condemned
him
are
the
last
words
in
law
and
science
you
said
in
your
letter
that
the
courts
were
so
slow
and
the
lawyers
so
yes
so
cold
so
technical
they
do
not
seem
to
realise
that
a
human
life
is
at
stake
with
them
it
is
almost
like
a
game
in
which
we
are
the
pawns
and
sometimes
i
fear
in
spite
of
what
the
lawyers
say
that
without
some
new
evidence
it
it
will
go
hard
with
him
you
have
not
given
up
hope
in
the
appeal
asked
kennedy
gently
it
is
merely
on
technicalities
of
the
law
she
replied
with
quiet
fortitude
that
is
as
nearly
as
i
can
make
out
from
the
language
of
the
papers
our
lawyer
is
salo
kahn
of
the
big
firm
of
criminal
lawyers
smith
kahn
conine
mused
kennedy
half
to
himself
i
could
not
tell
whether
he
was
thinking
of
what
he
repeated
or
of
the
little
woman
yes
the
active
principle
of
hemlock
she
went
on
that
was
what
the
experts
discovered
they
swore
in
the
pure
state
i
believe
it
is
more
poisonous
than
anything
except
the
cyanides
and
it
was
absolutely
scientific
evidence
they
repeated
the
tests
in
court
there
was
no
doubt
of
it
but
oh
he
did
not
do
it
some
one
else
did
it
he
did
not
he
could
not
kennedy
said
nothing
for
a
few
minutes
but
from
his
tone
when
he
did
speak
it
was
evident
that
he
was
deeply
touched
since
our
marriage
we
lived
with
old
godwin
in
the
historic
godwin
house
at
east
point
she
resumed
as
he
renewed
his
questioning
sanford
that
was
my
husband
real
last
name
until
he
came
as
a
boy
to
work
for
godwin
in
the
office
of
the
factory
and
was
adopted
by
his
employer
sanford
and
i
kept
house
for
him
about
a
year
ago
he
began
to
grow
feeble
and
seldom
went
to
the
factory
which
sanford
managed
for
him
one
night
godwin
was
taken
suddenly
ill
i
do
know
how
long
he
had
been
ill
before
we
heard
him
groaning
but
he
died
almost
before
we
could
summon
a
doctor
there
was
really
nothing
suspicious
about
it
but
there
had
always
been
a
great
deal
of
jealousy
of
my
husband
in
the
town
and
especially
among
the
few
distant
relatives
of
godwin
what
must
have
started
as
an
idle
gossipy
rumour
developed
into
a
serious
charge
that
my
husband
had
hastened
his
old
guardian
death
the
original
will
the
will
i
call
it
had
been
placed
in
the
safe
of
the
factory
several
years
ago
but
when
the
gossip
in
the
town
grew
bitter
one
day
when
we
were
out
some
private
detectives
entered
the
house
with
a
warrant
and
they
did
actually
find
a
will
another
will
about
which
we
knew
nothing
dated
later
than
the
first
and
hidden
with
some
papers
in
the
back
of
a
closet
or
sort
of
fire
proof
box
built
into
the
wall
of
the
library
the
second
will
was
identical
with
the
first
in
language
except
that
its
terms
were
reversed
and
instead
of
being
the
residuary
legatee
sanford
was
given
a
comparatively
small
annuity
and
the
elmores
were
made
residuary
legatees
instead
of
annuitants
and
who
are
these
elmores
asked
kennedy
curiously
there
are
three
two
grandnephews
and
a
grandniece
bradford
lambert
and
their
sister
miriam
and
they
live
in
east
point
also
old
godwin
was
not
very
friendly
with
his
sister
whose
grandchildren
they
were
they
were
the
only
other
heirs
living
and
although
sanford
never
had
anything
to
do
with
it
i
think
they
always
imagined
that
he
tried
to
prejudice
the
old
man
against
them
i
shall
want
to
see
the
elmores
or
at
least
some
one
who
represents
them
as
well
as
the
district
attorney
up
there
who
conducted
the
case
but
now
that
i
am
here
i
wonder
if
it
is
possible
that
i
could
bring
any
influence
to
bear
to
see
your
husband
godwin
sighed
once
a
month
she
replied
i
leave
this
window
walk
to
the
prison
where
the
warden
is
very
kind
to
me
and
then
i
can
see
sanford
of
course
there
are
bars
between
us
besides
the
regular
screen
but
i
can
have
an
hour
talk
and
in
those
talks
he
has
described
to
me
exactly
every
detail
of
his
life
in
the
the
prison
we
have
even
agreed
on
certain
hours
when
we
think
of
each
other
in
those
hours
i
know
almost
what
he
is
thinking
she
paused
to
collect
herself
perhaps
there
may
be
some
way
if
i
plead
with
the
warden
perhaps
you
may
be
considered
his
counsel
now
you
may
see
him
a
half
hour
later
we
sat
in
the
big
registry
room
of
the
prison
and
talked
with
the
warden
every
argument
that
kennedy
could
summon
was
brought
to
bear
he
even
talked
over
long
distance
with
the
lawyers
in
new
york
at
last
the
rules
were
relaxed
and
kennedy
was
admitted
on
some
technicality
as
counsel
counsel
can
see
the
condemned
as
often
as
necessary
we
were
conducted
down
a
flight
of
steps
and
past
huge
doors
along
corridors
and
through
the
regular
prison
until
at
last
we
were
in
what
the
prison
officials
called
the
section
for
the
condemned
every
one
else
calls
this
secret
heart
of
the
grim
place
the
death
house
it
is
made
up
of
two
rows
of
cells
some
eighteen
or
twenty
in
all
a
little
more
modern
in
construction
than
the
twelve
hundred
archaic
caverns
that
pass
for
cells
in
the
main
prison
at
each
end
of
the
corridor
sat
a
guard
armed
with
eyes
never
off
the
rows
of
cells
day
or
night
in
the
wall
on
one
side
was
a
door
the
little
green
door
the
door
from
the
death
house
to
the
death
chamber
while
kennedy
was
talking
to
the
prisoner
a
guard
volunteered
to
show
me
the
death
chamber
and
the
chair
no
other
furniture
was
there
in
the
little
brick
house
of
one
room
except
this
awful
chair
of
yellow
oak
with
broad
leather
straps
there
it
stood
the
sole
article
in
the
brightly
varnished
room
of
about
feet
square
with
walls
of
clean
blue
this
grim
acolyte
of
modern
scientific
death
there
were
the
wet
electrodes
that
are
fastened
to
the
legs
through
slits
in
the
trousers
at
the
calves
above
was
the
fixture
like
a
gruesome
helmet
of
leather
that
fits
over
the
head
carrying
the
other
electrode
back
of
the
condemned
was
the
switch
which
lets
loose
a
lethal
store
of
energy
and
back
of
that
the
prison
morgue
where
the
bodies
are
taken
i
looked
about
in
the
wall
to
the
left
toward
the
death
house
was
also
a
door
on
this
side
yellow
somehow
i
could
not
get
from
my
mind
the
fascination
of
that
door
the
threshold
of
the
grave
meanwhile
kennedy
sat
in
the
little
cage
and
talked
with
the
convicted
man
across
the
distance
between
cell
and
screen
i
did
not
see
him
at
that
time
but
kennedy
repeated
afterward
what
passed
and
it
so
impressed
me
that
i
will
set
it
down
as
if
i
had
been
present
sanford
godwin
was
a
tall
man
in
the
prison
pallor
of
whose
face
was
written
the
determination
of
despair
a
man
in
whose
blue
eyes
was
a
queer
light
of
hope
one
knew
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
little
woman
at
the
window
at
the
top
of
the
hill
the
hope
would
probably
long
ago
have
faded
but
this
man
knew
she
was
always
there
thinking
watching
eagerly
planning
in
aid
of
any
new
scheme
in
the
long
fight
for
freedom
the
alkaloid
was
present
that
is
certain
he
told
kennedy
my
wife
has
told
you
that
it
was
scientifically
proved
there
is
no
use
in
attacking
that
later
on
he
remarked
perhaps
you
think
it
strange
that
one
in
the
very
shadow
of
the
death
chair
the
word
stuck
in
his
throat
can
talk
so
impersonally
of
his
own
case
sometimes
i
think
it
is
not
my
case
but
some
one
else
and
then
that
door
he
shuddered
and
turned
away
from
it
on
one
side
was
life
such
as
it
was
on
the
other
instant
death
no
wonder
he
pleaded
with
kennedy
why
walter
exclaimed
craig
as
we
walked
back
to
the
office
to
telephone
to
town
for
a
car
to
take
us
up
to
east
point
whenever
he
looks
out
of
that
cage
he
sees
it
he
may
close
his
eyes
and
still
see
it
when
he
exercises
he
sees
it
thinking
by
day
and
dreaming
by
night
it
is
always
there
think
of
the
terrible
hours
that
man
must
pass
knowing
of
the
little
woman
eating
her
heart
out
is
he
really
guilty
i
must
find
out
if
he
is
not
i
never
saw
a
greater
tragedy
than
this
slow
remorseless
approach
of
death
in
that
daily
hourly
shadow
of
the
little
green
door
east
point
was
a
queer
old
town
on
the
upper
hudson
with
a
varying
assortment
of
industries
just
outside
the
old
house
of
the
godwins
stood
on
a
bluff
overlooking
the
majestic
river
kennedy
had
wanted
to
see
it
before
any
one
suspected
his
mission
and
a
note
from
godwin
to
a
friend
had
been
sufficient
carefully
he
went
over
the
deserted
and
now
house
for
the
authorities
had
spared
nothing
in
their
search
for
poison
even
going
over
the
garden
and
the
lawns
in
the
hope
of
finding
some
of
the
poisonous
shrub
hemlock
which
it
was
contended
had
been
used
to
put
an
end
to
godwin
as
yet
nothing
had
been
done
to
put
the
house
in
order
again
and
as
we
walked
about
we
noticed
a
pile
of
old
tins
in
the
yard
which
had
not
been
removed
kennedy
turned
them
over
with
his
stick
then
he
picked
one
up
and
examined
it
attentively
a
blown
can
he
remarked
blown
i
repeated
yes
when
the
contents
of
a
tin
begin
to
deteriorate
they
sometimes
give
off
gases
which
press
out
the
ends
of
the
tin
you
can
see
how
these
ends
bulge
our
next
visit
was
to
the
district
attorney
a
young
man
gordon
kilgore
who
seemed
not
unwilling
to
discuss
the
case
frankly
i
want
to
make
arrangements
for
disinterring
the
body
explained
kennedy
would
you
fight
such
a
move
not
at
all
not
at
all
he
answered
brusquely
simply
make
the
arrangements
through
kahn
i
shall
interpose
no
objection
it
is
the
strongest
most
impregnable
part
of
the
case
the
discovery
of
the
poison
if
you
can
break
that
down
you
will
do
more
than
any
one
else
has
dared
to
hope
but
it
ca
be
done
the
proof
was
too
strong
of
course
it
is
none
of
my
business
but
i
advise
some
other
point
of
attack
i
must
confess
to
a
feeling
of
disappointment
when
kennedy
announced
after
leaving
kilgore
that
for
the
present
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
done
at
east
point
until
kahn
had
made
the
arrangements
for
reopening
the
grave
we
motored
back
to
ossining
and
kennedy
tried
to
be
reassuring
to
godwin
by
the
way
he
remarked
just
before
we
left
you
used
a
good
deal
of
canned
goods
at
the
godwin
house
did
you
yes
but
not
more
than
other
people
i
think
she
said
do
you
recall
using
any
that
were
well
perhaps
not
exactly
spoiled
but
that
had
anything
peculiar
about
them
i
remember
once
we
thought
we
found
some
cans
that
seemed
to
have
been
attacked
by
mice
at
least
they
smelt
so
though
how
mice
could
get
through
a
tin
can
we
could
see
mice
queried
kennedy
had
a
mousey
smell
that
interesting
well
godwin
keep
up
a
good
heart
depend
on
me
what
you
have
told
me
has
made
me
more
than
interested
in
your
case
i
shall
waste
no
time
in
letting
you
know
when
anything
encouraging
develops
craig
had
never
had
much
patience
with
red
tape
that
barred
the
way
to
the
truth
yet
there
were
times
when
law
and
legal
procedure
had
to
be
respected
no
matter
how
much
they
hampered
and
this
was
one
of
them
the
next
day
the
order
was
obtained
permitting
the
opening
again
of
the
grave
of
old
godwin
the
body
was
exhumed
and
kennedy
set
about
his
examination
of
what
secrets
it
might
hide
meanwhile
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
suspense
was
terrible
kennedy
was
moving
slowly
i
thought
not
even
the
courts
themselves
could
have
been
more
deliberate
also
he
was
keeping
much
to
himself
still
for
another
whole
day
there
was
the
slow
inevitable
approach
of
the
thing
that
now
i
too
had
come
to
dread
the
handing
down
of
the
final
decision
on
the
appeal
yet
what
could
craig
do
otherwise
i
asked
myself
i
had
become
deeply
interested
in
the
case
by
this
time
and
spent
the
time
reading
all
the
evidence
hundreds
of
pages
of
it
it
was
cold
hard
brutal
scientific
fact
and
as
i
read
i
felt
that
hope
faded
for
the
man
and
the
pallid
little
woman
it
seemed
the
last
word
in
science
was
there
any
way
of
escape
impatient
as
i
was
i
often
wondered
what
must
have
been
the
suspense
of
those
to
whom
the
case
meant
everything
how
are
the
tests
coming
along
i
ventured
one
night
after
kahn
had
arranged
for
the
uncovering
of
the
grave
it
was
now
two
days
since
kennedy
had
gone
up
to
east
point
to
superintend
the
exhumation
and
had
returned
to
the
city
with
the
materials
which
had
caused
him
to
keep
later
hours
in
the
laboratory
than
i
had
ever
known
even
the
indefatigable
craig
to
spend
on
a
stretch
before
he
shook
his
head
doubtfully
walter
he
admitted
i
afraid
i
have
reached
the
limit
on
the
line
of
investigation
i
had
planned
at
the
start
i
looked
at
him
in
dismay
what
then
i
managed
to
gasp
i
am
going
up
to
east
point
again
to
look
over
that
house
and
start
a
new
line
you
can
go
no
urging
was
needed
and
the
following
day
saw
us
again
on
the
ground
the
house
as
i
have
said
had
been
almost
torn
to
pieces
in
the
search
for
the
will
and
the
poison
evidence
as
before
we
went
to
it
unannounced
and
this
time
we
had
no
difficulty
in
getting
in
kennedy
who
had
brought
with
him
a
large
package
made
his
way
directly
to
a
sort
of
next
to
the
large
library
in
the
closet
of
which
the
will
had
been
discovered
he
unwrapped
the
package
and
took
from
it
a
huge
brace
and
bit
the
bit
a
long
thin
murderous
looking
affair
such
as
might
have
come
from
a
burglar
kit
i
regarded
it
much
in
that
light
what
the
lay
i
asked
as
he
tapped
over
the
walls
to
ascertain
of
just
what
they
were
composed
without
a
word
he
was
now
down
on
his
knees
drilling
a
hole
in
the
plaster
and
lath
when
he
struck
an
obstruction
he
stopped
removed
the
bit
inserted
another
and
began
again
are
you
going
to
put
in
a
detectaphone
i
asked
again
he
shook
his
head
a
detectaphone
would
be
of
any
use
here
he
replied
no
one
is
going
to
do
any
talking
in
that
room
again
the
brace
and
bit
were
at
work
at
last
the
wall
had
been
penetrated
and
he
quickly
removed
every
trace
from
the
other
side
that
would
have
attracted
attention
to
a
little
hole
in
an
obscure
corner
of
the
flowered
next
he
drew
out
what
looked
like
a
long
perhaps
a
foot
long
and
of
an
inch
in
diameter
what
that
i
asked
as
he
rose
after
carefully
inserting
it
look
through
it
he
replied
simply
still
at
work
on
some
other
apparatus
he
had
brought
i
looked
in
spite
of
the
smallness
of
the
opening
at
the
other
end
i
was
amazed
to
find
that
i
could
see
nearly
the
whole
room
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
it
a
detectascope
he
explained
a
tube
with
a
lens
which
i
had
an
expert
optician
make
for
me
a
lens
i
repeated
yes
the
focus
may
be
altered
in
range
so
that
any
one
in
the
room
may
be
seen
and
recognised
and
any
action
of
his
may
be
detected
the
original
of
this
was
devised
by
gaillard
smith
the
adapter
of
the
detectaphone
the
instrument
is
something
like
the
cytoscope
which
the
doctors
use
to
look
into
the
human
interior
now
look
through
it
again
do
you
see
the
closet
again
i
looked
yes
i
said
but
will
one
of
us
have
to
watch
here
all
the
time
he
had
been
working
on
a
black
box
in
the
meantime
and
now
he
began
to
set
it
up
adjusting
it
to
the
hole
in
the
wall
which
he
enlarged
on
our
side
no
that
is
my
own
improvement
on
it
you
remember
once
we
used
a
camera
with
an
electric
attachment
which
moved
the
shutter
on
the
contact
of
a
person
with
an
object
in
the
room
well
this
camera
has
that
quick
shutter
but
in
addition
i
have
adapted
to
the
detectascope
an
invention
by
professor
robert
wood
of
johns
hopkins
he
has
devised
a
camera
that
over
a
radius
of
one
hundred
and
eighty
degrees
not
only
straight
in
front
but
over
half
a
circle
every
point
in
that
room
you
know
the
refracting
power
of
a
drop
of
water
since
it
is
a
globe
it
refracts
the
light
which
reaches
it
from
all
directions
if
it
is
placed
like
the
lens
of
a
camera
as
wood
tried
it
so
that
of
it
catches
the
light
all
the
light
caught
will
be
refracted
through
it
fishes
too
have
a
wide
range
of
vision
some
have
eyes
that
see
over
half
a
circle
so
the
lens
gets
its
name
ordinary
cameras
because
of
the
flatness
of
their
lenses
have
a
range
of
only
a
few
degrees
the
widest
in
use
i
believe
taking
in
only
or
a
little
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
circle
so
you
see
my
detectascope
has
a
range
almost
twice
as
wide
as
that
of
any
other
though
i
did
not
know
what
he
expected
to
discover
and
knew
that
it
was
useless
to
ask
the
thing
seemed
very
interesting
craig
did
not
pause
however
to
enlarge
on
the
new
machine
but
gathered
up
his
tools
and
announced
that
our
next
step
would
be
a
visit
to
a
lawyer
whom
the
elmores
had
retained
as
their
personal
counsel
to
look
after
their
interests
now
that
the
district
attorney
seemed
to
hare
cleared
up
the
criminal
end
of
the
case
hollins
was
one
of
the
prominent
attorneys
of
east
point
and
before
the
election
of
kilgore
as
prosecutor
had
been
his
partner
unlike
kilgore
we
found
him
especially
uncommunicative
and
inclined
to
resent
our
presence
in
the
case
as
intruders
the
interview
did
not
seem
to
me
to
be
productive
of
anything
in
fact
it
seemed
as
if
craig
were
giving
hollins
much
more
than
he
was
getting
i
shall
be
in
town
over
night
remarked
craig
in
fact
i
am
thinking
of
going
over
the
library
up
at
the
godwin
house
soon
very
carefully
he
spoke
casually
there
may
be
you
know
some
on
the
walls
around
that
closet
which
might
prove
interesting
a
quick
look
from
hollins
was
the
only
answer
in
fact
it
was
seldom
that
he
uttered
more
than
a
monosyllable
as
we
talked
over
the
various
aspects
of
the
case
a
later
when
he
had
left
and
had
gone
to
the
hotel
i
asked
kennedy
suspiciously
why
did
you
expose
your
hand
to
hollins
craig
he
laughed
oh
walter
he
remonstrated
do
you
know
that
it
is
nearly
always
useless
to
look
for
except
under
some
circumstances
even
a
few
days
afterward
this
is
months
not
days
why
on
iron
and
steel
they
last
with
tolerable
certainty
only
a
short
time
and
not
much
longer
on
silver
glass
or
wood
but
they
are
seldom
permanent
unless
they
are
made
with
ink
or
blood
or
something
that
leaves
a
more
or
less
indelible
mark
that
was
a
but
what
do
you
expect
to
gain
by
it
well
he
replied
enigmatically
no
one
is
necessarily
honest
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
when
kennedy
again
visited
the
godwin
house
and
examined
the
camera
without
a
word
he
pulled
the
detectascope
from
the
wall
and
carried
the
whole
thing
to
the
of
the
local
photographer
there
he
set
to
work
on
the
film
and
i
watched
him
in
silence
he
seemed
very
much
excited
as
he
watched
the
film
develop
until
at
last
he
held
it
up
dripping
to
the
red
light
some
one
has
entered
that
room
this
afternoon
and
attempted
to
wipe
off
the
walls
and
woodwork
of
that
closet
as
i
expected
he
exclaimed
who
was
it
i
asked
leaning
over
kennedy
said
nothing
but
pointed
to
a
figure
on
the
film
i
bent
closer
it
was
the
figure
of
a
woman
miriam
i
exclaimed
in
surprise
xxiv
the
final
day
i
looked
aghast
at
him
if
it
had
been
either
bradford
or
lambert
both
of
whom
we
had
come
to
know
since
kennedy
had
interested
himself
in
the
case
or
even
hollins
or
kilgore
i
should
not
have
been
surprised
but
miriam
how
could
she
have
any
connection
with
the
case
i
asked
incredulously
kennedy
did
not
attempt
to
explain
it
is
a
fatal
mistake
walter
for
a
detective
to
assume
that
he
knows
what
anybody
would
do
in
any
given
circumstances
the
only
safe
course
for
him
is
to
find
out
what
the
persons
in
question
did
do
people
are
always
doing
the
unexpected
this
is
a
case
of
it
as
you
see
i
am
merely
trying
to
get
back
at
facts
come
i
think
we
might
as
well
not
stay
over
night
after
all
i
should
like
to
drop
off
on
the
way
back
to
the
city
to
see
mrs
godwin
as
we
rode
up
the
hill
i
was
surprised
to
see
that
there
was
no
one
at
the
window
nor
did
any
one
seem
to
pay
attention
to
our
knocking
at
the
door
kennedy
turned
the
knob
quickly
and
strode
in
seated
in
a
chair
as
white
as
a
wraith
from
the
grave
was
godwin
staring
straight
ahead
seeing
nothing
hearing
nothing
what
the
matter
demanded
kennedy
leaping
to
her
side
and
grasping
her
icy
hand
the
stare
on
her
face
seemed
to
change
slightly
as
she
recognised
him
walter
some
water
and
a
little
brandy
if
there
is
any
tell
me
what
has
happened
from
her
lap
a
yellow
telegram
had
fluttered
to
the
floor
but
before
he
could
pick
it
up
she
gasped
the
appeal
it
has
been
denied
kennedy
picked
up
the
paper
it
was
a
message
unsigned
but
not
from
kahn
as
its
wording
and
in
fact
the
circumstances
plainly
showed
the
execution
is
set
for
the
week
beginning
the
fifth
she
continued
in
the
same
hollow
mechanical
voice
my
god
that
next
monday
she
had
risen
now
and
was
pacing
the
room
no
i
not
going
to
faint
i
wish
i
could
i
wish
i
could
cry
i
wish
i
could
do
something
oh
those
elmores
they
must
have
sent
it
no
one
would
have
been
so
cruel
but
they
she
stopped
and
gazed
wildly
out
of
the
window
at
the
prison
neither
of
us
knew
what
to
say
for
the
moment
many
times
from
this
window
she
cried
i
have
seen
a
man
walk
out
of
that
prison
gate
i
always
watch
to
see
what
he
does
though
i
know
it
is
no
use
if
he
stands
in
the
free
air
stops
short
and
looks
up
suddenly
taking
a
long
look
at
every
house
i
hope
but
he
always
turns
for
a
quick
backward
look
at
the
prison
and
goes
half
running
down
the
hill
they
always
stop
in
that
fashion
when
the
steel
door
opens
outward
yet
i
have
always
looked
and
hoped
but
i
can
hope
no
more
no
more
the
last
chance
is
gone
no
not
the
last
chance
exclaimed
craig
springing
to
her
side
lest
she
should
fall
then
he
added
gently
you
must
come
with
me
to
east
point
immediately
what
leave
him
here
alone
in
the
last
days
no
no
no
never
i
must
see
him
i
wonder
if
they
have
told
him
yet
it
was
evident
that
she
had
lost
faith
in
kennedy
in
everybody
now
godwin
he
urged
come
you
must
it
is
a
last
chance
eagerly
he
was
pouring
out
the
story
of
the
discovery
of
the
afternoon
by
the
little
detectascope
miriam
she
repeated
dazed
she
know
anything
it
ca
be
no
do
raise
a
false
hope
now
it
is
the
last
chance
he
urged
again
come
there
is
not
an
hour
to
waste
now
there
was
no
delay
no
deliberation
about
kennedy
now
he
had
been
forced
out
into
the
open
by
the
course
of
events
and
he
meant
to
take
advantage
of
every
precious
moment
down
the
hill
our
car
sped
to
the
town
with
godwin
still
protesting
but
hardly
realising
what
was
going
on
regardless
of
tolls
kennedy
called
up
his
laboratory
in
new
york
and
had
two
of
his
most
careful
students
pack
up
the
stuff
which
he
described
minutely
to
be
carried
to
east
point
immediately
by
train
kahn
too
was
at
last
found
and
summoned
to
meet
us
there
also
miles
never
seemed
longer
than
they
did
to
us
as
we
tore
over
the
country
from
ossining
to
east
point
a
silent
party
yet
keyed
up
by
an
excitement
that
none
of
us
had
ever
felt
before
impatiently
we
awaited
the
arrival
of
the
men
from
laboratory
while
we
made
godwin
as
comfortable
as
possible
in
a
room
at
the
hotel
in
one
of
the
parlours
kennedy
was
improvising
a
laboratory
as
best
he
could
meanwhile
kahn
had
arrived
and
together
we
were
seeking
those
whose
connection
with
or
interest
in
the
case
made
necessary
their
presence
it
was
well
along
toward
midnight
before
the
hasty
conference
had
been
gathered
besides
godwin
salo
kahn
and
ourselves
the
three
elmores
kilgore
and
hollins
strange
though
it
was
the
room
seemed
to
me
almost
to
have
assumed
the
familiar
look
of
the
laboratory
in
new
york
there
was
the
same
clutter
of
tubes
and
jars
on
the
tables
but
above
all
that
same
feeling
of
suspense
in
the
air
which
i
had
come
to
associate
with
the
clearing
up
of
a
case
there
was
something
else
in
the
air
too
it
was
a
peculiar
mousey
smell
disagreeable
and
one
which
made
it
a
relief
to
have
kennedy
begin
in
a
low
voice
to
tell
why
he
had
called
us
together
so
hastily
i
shall
start
announced
kennedy
at
the
point
where
the
state
left
off
with
the
proof
that
godwin
died
of
conine
or
hemlock
poisoning
conine
as
every
chemist
knows
has
a
long
and
history
it
was
the
first
alkaloid
to
be
synthesised
here
is
a
sample
this
colourless
oily
fluid
no
doubt
you
have
noticed
the
mousey
odour
in
this
room
as
little
as
one
part
of
conine
to
fifty
thousand
of
water
gives
off
that
odour
it
is
characteristic
i
have
proceeded
with
extraordinary
caution
in
my
investigation
of
this
case
he
went
on
in
fact
there
would
have
been
no
value
in
it
otherwise
for
the
experts
for
the
people
seem
to
have
established
the
presence
of
conine
in
the
body
with
absolute
certainty
he
paused
and
we
waited
expectantly
i
have
had
the
body
exhumed
and
have
repeated
the
tests
the
alkaloid
which
i
discovered
had
given
precisely
the
same
results
as
in
their
tests
my
heart
sank
what
was
he
doing
convicting
the
man
over
again
there
is
one
other
test
which
i
tried
he
continued
but
which
i
can
not
take
time
to
duplicate
tonight
it
was
testified
at
the
trial
that
conine
the
active
principle
of
hemlock
is
intensely
poisonous
no
chemical
antidote
is
known
a
fifth
of
a
grain
has
serious
results
a
drop
is
fatal
an
injection
of
a
most
minute
quantity
of
real
conine
will
kill
a
mouse
for
instance
almost
instantly
but
the
conine
which
i
have
isolated
in
the
body
is
inert
it
came
like
a
bombshell
to
the
prosecution
so
bewildering
was
the
discovery
inert
cried
kilgore
and
hollins
almost
together
it
ca
be
you
are
making
sport
of
the
best
chemical
experts
that
money
could
obtain
inert
read
the
evidence
read
the
books
on
the
contrary
resumed
craig
ignoring
the
interruption
all
the
reactions
obtained
by
the
experts
have
been
duplicated
by
me
but
in
addition
i
tried
this
one
test
which
they
did
not
try
i
repeat
the
conine
isolated
in
the
body
is
inert
we
were
too
perplexed
to
question
him
alkaloids
he
continued
quietly
as
you
know
have
names
that
end
in
or
morphine
strychnine
and
so
on
now
there
are
two
kinds
of
alkaloids
which
are
sometimes
called
vegetable
and
animal
moreover
there
is
a
large
class
of
which
we
are
learning
much
which
are
called
the
ptomaines
from
ptoma
a
corpse
ptomaine
poisoning
as
every
one
knows
results
when
we
eat
food
that
has
begun
to
decay
ptomaines
are
chemical
compounds
of
an
alkaloidal
nature
formed
in
protein
substances
during
putrefaction
they
are
purely
chemical
bodies
and
differ
from
the
toxins
there
are
also
what
are
called
leucomaines
formed
in
living
tissues
and
when
not
given
off
by
the
body
they
produce
there
are
more
than
three
score
ptomaines
and
half
of
them
are
poisonous
in
fact
illness
due
to
eating
infected
foods
is
much
more
common
than
is
generally
supposed
often
there
is
only
one
case
in
a
number
of
those
eating
the
food
due
merely
to
that
person
inability
to
throw
off
the
poison
such
cases
are
difficult
to
distinguish
they
are
usually
supposed
to
be
ptomaines
as
their
name
shows
are
found
in
dead
bodies
they
are
found
in
all
dead
matter
after
a
time
whether
it
is
decayed
food
or
a
decaying
corpse
no
general
reaction
is
known
by
which
the
ptomaines
can
be
distinguished
from
the
vegetable
alkaloids
but
we
know
that
animal
alkaloids
always
develop
either
as
a
result
of
decay
of
food
or
of
the
decay
of
the
body
itself
at
one
stroke
kennedy
had
reopened
the
closed
case
and
had
placed
the
experts
at
sea
i
find
that
there
is
an
animal
conine
as
well
as
the
true
conine
he
hammered
out
the
truth
of
this
matter
is
that
the
experts
have
confounded
vegetable
conine
with
cadaveric
conine
that
raises
an
interesting
question
assuming
the
presence
of
conine
where
did
it
come
from
he
paused
and
began
a
new
line
of
attack
as
the
use
of
canned
goods
becomes
more
and
more
extensive
ptomaine
poisoning
is
more
frequent
in
canning
the
cans
are
heated
they
are
composed
of
thin
sheets
of
iron
coated
with
tin
the
seams
pressed
and
soldered
with
a
thin
line
of
solder
they
are
filled
with
cooked
food
sterilised
and
closed
the
bacteria
are
usually
all
killed
but
now
and
then
the
apparatus
does
not
work
and
they
develop
in
the
can
that
results
in
a
can
the
ends
bulge
a
little
bit
on
opening
a
gas
escapes
the
food
has
a
bad
odour
and
a
bad
taste
sometimes
people
say
that
the
tin
and
lead
poison
them
in
practically
all
cases
the
poisoning
is
of
bacterial
not
metallic
origin
godwin
may
have
died
of
poisoning
probably
did
but
it
was
ptomaine
poisoning
the
blown
cans
which
i
have
discovered
would
indicate
that
i
was
following
him
closely
yet
though
this
seemed
to
explain
a
part
of
the
case
it
was
far
from
explaining
all
then
followed
he
hurried
on
the
development
of
the
usual
ptomaines
in
the
body
itself
these
i
may
say
had
no
relation
to
the
cause
of
death
itself
the
putrefactive
germs
began
their
attack
whatever
there
may
have
been
in
the
body
before
certainly
they
produced
a
cadaveric
ptomaine
conine
for
many
animal
tissues
and
fluids
especially
if
somewhat
decomposed
yield
not
infrequently
compounds
of
an
oily
nature
with
a
mousey
odour
fuming
with
hydrochloric
acid
and
in
short
acting
just
like
conine
there
is
ample
evidence
i
have
found
that
conine
or
a
substance
possessing
most
if
not
all
of
its
properties
is
at
times
actually
produced
in
animal
tissues
by
decomposition
and
the
fact
is
i
believe
that
a
number
of
cases
have
arisen
in
which
the
poisonous
alkaloid
was
at
first
supposed
to
have
been
discovered
which
were
really
mistakes
the
idea
was
startling
in
the
extreme
here
was
kennedy
as
it
were
overturning
what
had
been
considered
the
last
word
in
science
as
it
had
been
laid
down
by
the
experts
for
the
prosecution
opinions
so
impregnable
that
courts
and
juries
had
not
hesitated
to
condemn
a
man
to
death
there
have
been
cases
craig
went
on
solemnly
and
i
believe
this
to
be
one
where
death
has
been
pronounced
to
have
been
caused
by
wilful
administration
of
a
vegetable
alkaloid
which
toxicologists
would
now
put
down
as
cases
innocent
people
have
possibly
already
suffered
and
may
in
the
future
but
medical
experts
he
laid
especial
stress
on
the
word
are
much
more
alive
to
the
danger
of
mistake
than
formerly
this
was
a
case
where
the
danger
was
not
considered
either
through
carelessness
ignorance
or
prejudice
indeed
ptomaines
are
present
probably
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
in
every
organ
which
is
submitted
to
the
toxicologist
for
examination
if
he
is
ignorant
of
the
nature
of
these
substances
he
may
easily
mistake
them
for
vegetable
alkaloids
he
may
report
a
given
poison
present
when
it
is
not
present
it
is
even
yet
a
new
line
of
inquiry
which
has
only
recently
been
followed
and
the
information
is
still
comparatively
small
and
inadequate
it
is
very
difficult
perhaps
impossible
for
the
chemist
to
state
absolutely
that
he
has
detected
true
conine
before
he
can
do
it
the
symptoms
and
the
appearance
must
agree
analysis
must
be
made
before
not
after
decomposition
sets
in
and
the
amount
of
the
poison
found
must
be
sufficient
to
experiment
with
not
merely
to
react
to
a
few
usual
tests
what
the
experts
asserted
so
positively
i
would
not
dare
to
assert
was
he
killed
by
ordinary
ptomaine
poisoning
and
had
conine
or
rather
its
double
developed
first
in
his
food
along
with
other
ptomaines
that
were
not
inert
or
did
the
cadaveric
conine
develop
only
in
the
body
after
death
chemistry
alone
can
not
decide
the
question
so
glibly
as
the
experts
did
further
proof
must
be
sought
other
sciences
must
come
to
our
aid
i
was
sitting
next
to
godwin
as
kennedy
words
rang
out
her
hand
trembling
with
emotion
pressed
my
arm
i
turned
quickly
to
see
if
she
needed
assistance
her
face
was
radiant
all
the
fees
for
big
cases
in
the
world
could
never
have
compensated
kennedy
for
the
mute
unrestrained
gratitude
which
the
little
woman
shot
at
him
kennedy
saw
it
and
in
the
quick
shifting
of
his
eyes
to
my
face
i
read
that
he
relied
on
me
to
take
care
of
godwin
while
he
plunged
again
into
the
clearing
up
of
the
mystery
i
have
here
the
will
the
second
one
he
snapped
out
turning
and
facing
the
others
in
the
room
craig
turned
a
switch
in
an
apparatus
which
his
students
had
brought
from
new
york
from
a
tube
on
the
table
came
a
peculiar
bluish
light
this
he
explained
is
a
source
of
ultraviolet
rays
they
are
not
the
bluish
light
which
you
see
but
rays
contained
in
it
which
you
can
not
see
ultraviolet
rays
have
recently
been
found
very
valuable
in
the
examination
of
questioned
documents
by
the
use
of
a
lens
made
of
quartz
covered
with
a
thin
film
of
metallic
silver
there
has
been
developed
a
practical
means
of
making
photographs
by
the
invisible
rays
of
light
above
the
spectrum
these
ultraviolet
rays
the
quartz
lens
is
necessary
because
these
rays
will
not
pass
through
ordinary
glass
while
the
silver
film
acts
as
a
screen
to
cut
off
the
ordinary
light
rays
and
those
below
the
spectrum
by
this
means
most
white
objects
are
photographed
black
and
even
transparent
objects
like
glass
are
black
i
obtained
the
copy
of
this
will
but
under
the
condition
from
the
surrogate
that
absolutely
nothing
must
be
done
to
it
to
change
a
fibre
of
the
paper
or
a
line
of
a
letter
it
was
a
difficult
condition
while
there
are
chemicals
which
are
frequently
resorted
to
for
testing
the
authenticity
of
disputed
documents
such
as
wills
and
deeds
their
use
frequently
injures
or
destroys
the
paper
under
test
so
far
as
i
could
determine
the
document
also
defied
the
microscope
but
ultraviolet
photography
does
not
affect
the
document
tested
in
any
way
and
it
has
lately
been
used
practically
in
detecting
forgeries
i
have
photographed
the
last
page
of
the
will
with
its
signatures
and
here
it
is
what
the
eye
itself
can
not
see
the
invisible
light
reveals
he
was
holding
the
document
and
the
copy
just
an
instant
as
if
considering
how
to
announce
with
best
effect
what
he
had
discovered
in
order
to
unravel
this
mystery
he
resumed
looking
up
and
facing
the
elmores
kilgore
and
hollins
squarely
i
decided
to
find
out
whether
any
one
had
had
access
to
that
closet
where
the
will
was
hidden
it
was
long
ago
and
there
seemed
to
be
little
that
i
could
do
i
knew
it
was
useless
to
look
for
fingerprints
so
i
used
what
we
detectives
now
call
the
law
of
suggestion
i
questioned
closely
one
who
was
in
touch
with
all
those
who
might
have
had
such
access
i
hinted
broadly
at
seeking
fingerprints
which
might
lead
to
the
identity
of
one
who
had
entered
the
house
unknown
to
the
godwins
and
placed
a
document
where
private
detectives
would
subsequently
find
it
under
suspicious
circumstances
naturally
it
would
seem
to
one
who
was
guilty
of
such
an
act
or
knew
of
it
that
there
might
after
all
be
i
tried
it
i
found
out
through
this
little
tube
the
detectascope
that
one
really
entered
the
room
after
that
and
tried
to
wipe
off
any
supposed
that
might
still
remain
that
settled
it
the
second
will
was
a
forgery
and
the
person
who
entered
that
room
so
stealthily
this
afternoon
knows
that
it
is
a
forgery
as
kennedy
slapped
down
on
the
table
the
film
from
his
camera
which
had
been
concealed
godwin
turned
her
now
large
and
unnaturally
bright
eyes
and
met
those
of
the
other
woman
in
the
room
oh
oh
heaven
help
us
me
i
mean
cried
miriam
unable
to
bear
the
strain
of
the
turn
of
events
longer
i
knew
there
would
be
retribution
i
knew
i
knew
godwin
was
on
her
feet
in
a
moment
once
my
intuition
was
not
wrong
though
all
science
and
law
was
against
me
she
pleaded
with
kennedy
there
was
a
gentleness
in
her
tone
that
fell
like
a
soft
rain
on
the
surging
passions
of
those
who
had
wronged
her
so
shamefully
professor
kennedy
miriam
could
not
have
forged
kennedy
smiled
science
was
not
against
you
godwin
ignorance
was
against
you
and
your
intuition
does
not
go
contrary
to
science
this
time
either
it
was
a
splendid
exhibition
of
fine
feeling
which
kennedy
waited
to
have
impressed
on
the
elmores
as
though
burning
it
into
their
minds
miriam
elmore
knew
that
her
brothers
had
forged
a
will
and
hidden
it
to
expose
them
was
to
convict
them
of
a
crime
she
kept
their
secret
which
was
the
secret
of
all
three
she
even
tried
to
hide
the
which
would
have
branded
her
brothers
for
ptomaine
poisoning
had
unexpectedly
hastened
the
end
of
old
godwin
then
gossip
and
the
did
the
rest
it
was
accidental
but
bradford
and
lambert
elmore
were
willing
to
let
events
take
their
course
and
declare
genuine
the
forgery
which
they
had
made
so
skilfully
even
though
it
convicted
an
innocent
man
of
murder
and
killed
his
faithful
wife
as
soon
as
the
courts
can
be
set
in
motion
to
correct
an
error
of
science
by
the
truth
of
later
science
sing
sing
will
lose
one
prisoner
from
the
death
house
and
gain
two
forgers
in
his
place
godwin
stood
before
us
radiant
but
as
kennedy
last
words
sank
into
her
mind
her
face
clouded
must
must
it
be
an
eye
for
an
eye
and
a
tooth
for
a
tooth
she
pleaded
eagerly
must
that
grim
prison
take
in
others
even
if
my
husband
goes
free
kennedy
looked
at
her
long
and
earnestly
as
if
to
let
the
beauty
of
her
character
trained
by
its
long
suffering
impress
itself
on
his
mind
indelibly
he
shook
his
head
slowly
i
afraid
there
is
no
other
way
godwin
he
said
gently
taking
her
arm
and
leaving
the
others
to
be
dealt
with
by
a
constable
whom
he
had
dozing
in
the
hotel
lobby
kahn
is
going
up
to
albany
to
get
the
pardon
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
it
now
he
added
godwin
if
you
care
to
do
so
you
may
stay
here
at
the
hotel
or
you
may
go
down
with
us
on
the
midnight
train
as
far
as
ossining
i
will
wire
ahead
for
a
conveyance
to
meet
you
at
the
station
jameson
and
i
must
go
on
to
new
york
the
nearer
i
am
to
sanford
now
the
happier
i
shall
be
she
answered
bravely
keeping
back
the
tears
of
happiness
the
ride
down
to
new
york
after
our
train
left
ossining
was
accomplished
in
a
day
coach
in
which
our
fellow
passengers
slept
in
every
conceivable
attitude
of
discomfort
yet
late
or
rather
early
as
it
was
we
found
plenty
of
life
still
in
the
great
city
that
never
sleeps
tired
exhausted
i
was
at
least
glad
to
feel
that
finally
we
were
at
home
craig
i
yawned
as
i
began
to
throw
off
my
clothes
i
ready
to
sleep
a
week
there
was
no
answer
i
looked
up
at
him
almost
resentfully
he
had
picked
up
the
mail
that
lay
under
our
letter
slot
and
was
going
through
it
as
eagerly
as
if
the
clock
registered
instead
of
let
me
see
i
mumbled
sleepily
checking
over
my
notes
how
many
days
have
we
been
at
it
i
turned
the
pages
slowly
after
the
manner
in
which
my
mind
was
working
it
was
the
when
you
got
that
letter
from
ossining
i
calculated
and
makes
the
thirtieth
my
heavens
is
there
still
another
day
of
it
is
there
no
rest
for
the
wicked
kennedy
looked
up
and
laughed
he
was
pointing
at
the
calendar
on
the
desk
before
him
there
are
only
thirty
days
in
the
month
he
remarked
slowly
thank
the
lord
i
exclaimed
i
all
in
he
tipped
his
back
and
bit
the
amber
of
his
meerchaum
contemplatively
but
is
the
first
he
drawled
turning
the
leaf
on
the
calendar
with
just
a
flicker
of
a
smile
the
end
