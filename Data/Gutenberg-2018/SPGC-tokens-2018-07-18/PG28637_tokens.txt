the
marriage
of
elinor
chapter
john
tatham
received
one
summer
morning
as
he
sat
at
breakfast
the
following
letter
it
was
written
in
what
was
once
known
distinctively
as
a
lady
hand
in
pointed
characters
very
fine
and
delicate
and
was
to
this
effect
dear
john
have
you
heard
from
elinor
of
her
new
prospects
and
intentions
i
suppose
she
must
have
written
to
you
on
the
subject
do
you
know
anything
of
the
man
you
know
how
hard
it
is
to
convince
her
against
her
will
of
anything
and
also
how
poorly
gifted
i
am
with
the
power
of
convincing
any
one
and
i
do
know
him
therefore
can
speak
with
no
authority
if
you
can
do
anything
to
clear
things
up
come
and
do
so
i
am
very
anxious
and
more
than
doubtful
but
her
heart
seems
set
upon
it
your
affect
tatham
was
a
and
vigorous
man
of
with
health
good
behaviour
and
in
every
line
of
his
cheerful
countenance
and
every
close
curl
of
his
brown
hair
his
hair
was
very
curly
and
helped
to
give
him
the
cheerful
look
which
was
one
of
his
chief
characteristics
nevertheless
when
these
innocent
seeming
words
do
you
know
the
man
which
was
more
certainly
demonstrative
of
certain
facts
than
had
those
facts
been
stated
in
the
fullest
detail
met
his
eye
tatham
paused
and
laid
down
the
letter
with
a
start
his
ruddy
colour
paled
for
the
moment
and
he
felt
something
which
was
like
the
push
or
poke
of
a
blunt
but
heavy
weapon
somewhere
in
the
regions
of
the
heart
for
the
moment
he
felt
that
he
could
not
read
any
more
do
you
know
the
man
he
did
not
even
ask
what
man
in
the
momentary
sickness
of
his
heart
then
he
said
to
himself
almost
angrily
well
and
took
up
the
letter
again
and
read
to
the
end
well
of
course
it
was
a
thing
that
he
knew
might
happen
any
day
and
which
he
had
expected
to
happen
for
the
last
four
or
five
years
it
was
nothing
to
him
one
way
or
another
nothing
could
be
more
absurd
than
that
a
hearty
and
strong
young
man
in
the
full
tide
of
his
life
and
with
a
good
breakfast
before
him
should
receive
a
shock
from
that
innocent
little
letter
as
if
he
had
been
a
sentimental
woman
but
the
fact
is
that
he
pushed
his
plate
away
with
an
exclamation
of
disgust
and
a
feeling
that
everything
was
bad
and
uneatable
he
drank
his
tea
though
that
also
became
suddenly
bad
too
full
of
tannin
like
tea
that
has
stood
too
long
a
thing
about
which
john
was
very
particular
he
had
been
half
an
hour
later
than
usual
this
morning
consequent
on
having
been
an
hour
or
two
later
than
usual
last
night
these
things
have
their
reward
and
that
very
speedily
but
as
for
the
letter
what
could
that
have
to
do
with
the
bad
toasting
of
the
bacon
and
the
tannin
in
the
tea
do
you
know
the
man
there
was
a
sort
of
covert
insult
too
in
the
phraseology
as
if
no
explanation
was
needed
as
if
he
must
know
by
instinct
what
she
meant
he
who
knew
nothing
about
it
who
did
not
know
there
was
a
man
at
all
after
a
while
he
began
to
smile
rather
cynically
to
himself
he
had
got
up
from
the
breakfast
table
where
everything
was
so
bad
and
had
gone
to
look
out
of
one
of
the
windows
of
his
pleasant
it
was
in
one
of
the
wider
ways
of
the
temple
and
looked
out
upon
various
houses
with
a
pleasant
misty
light
upon
the
redness
of
their
old
brickwork
and
a
stretch
of
green
grass
and
trees
which
were
scanty
in
foliage
yet
suited
very
well
with
the
bright
morning
sun
which
was
not
particularly
warm
but
looked
as
if
it
were
a
good
deal
for
effect
and
not
so
very
much
for
use
that
thought
floated
across
his
mind
with
others
and
was
of
the
same
cynical
complexion
it
was
very
well
for
the
sun
to
shine
making
the
glistening
poplars
and
glow
and
warming
all
the
mellow
redness
of
the
old
houses
but
what
did
he
mean
by
it
no
warmth
to
speak
of
only
a
fictitious
gleam
a
thing
got
up
for
effect
and
so
was
the
affectionateness
of
woman
meaning
nothing
only
an
effect
of
warmth
and
geniality
nothing
beyond
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
reminded
himself
after
a
while
that
he
had
never
wanted
anything
beyond
neither
asked
for
it
nor
wished
it
he
had
no
desire
to
change
the
conditions
of
his
life
women
never
rested
till
they
had
done
so
manufacturing
a
new
event
whatever
it
might
be
pleased
even
when
they
were
not
pleased
to
have
a
novelty
to
announce
that
no
doubt
was
the
state
of
mind
in
which
the
lady
who
called
herself
his
aunt
was
pleased
to
have
something
to
tell
him
to
fire
off
her
big
guns
in
his
face
even
though
she
was
not
at
all
pleased
with
the
event
itself
but
john
tatham
on
the
other
hand
had
desired
nothing
to
happen
things
were
very
well
as
they
were
he
liked
to
have
a
place
where
he
could
run
down
from
saturday
to
monday
whenever
he
pleased
and
where
his
visit
was
always
a
cheerful
event
for
the
womankind
he
had
liked
to
take
them
all
the
news
to
carry
the
quite
a
load
to
take
down
a
new
book
for
elinor
to
taste
doubtfully
his
wine
and
tell
her
she
had
better
let
him
choose
it
for
her
it
was
a
very
pleasant
state
of
affairs
he
wanted
no
change
not
certainly
above
everything
the
intrusion
of
a
stranger
whose
very
existence
had
been
unknown
to
him
until
he
was
thus
asked
cynically
almost
brutally
do
you
know
the
man
the
hour
came
when
john
had
to
assume
the
costume
of
that
order
of
workers
whom
a
persistent
popular
joke
nicknames
the
devil
own
that
is
he
had
to
put
on
gown
and
wig
and
go
off
to
the
courts
where
he
was
envied
of
all
the
briefless
as
a
man
who
for
his
age
had
a
great
deal
to
do
he
devilled
for
asstewt
the
great
chancery
man
which
was
the
most
excellent
beginning
and
he
was
getting
into
a
little
practice
of
his
own
which
was
not
to
be
sneezed
at
but
he
did
not
find
himself
in
a
satisfactory
frame
of
mind
he
found
himself
asking
the
judge
do
you
know
anything
of
the
man
when
it
was
his
special
business
so
to
bewilder
that
potentate
with
elaborate
arguments
that
he
should
not
have
time
to
consider
whether
he
had
ever
heard
of
the
particular
man
before
him
thus
it
was
evident
that
tatham
was
completely
de
son
as
the
french
say
upset
and
out
of
it
according
to
the
equally
vivid
imagination
of
the
english
manufacturer
of
slang
john
tatham
was
a
very
capable
young
lawyer
on
ordinary
occasions
and
it
was
all
the
more
remarkable
that
he
should
have
been
so
confused
in
his
mind
when
he
went
back
to
his
chambers
in
the
evening
which
was
not
until
it
was
time
to
dress
for
dinner
he
saw
a
bulky
letter
lying
on
his
table
but
avoided
it
as
if
it
had
been
an
overdue
bill
he
was
engaged
to
dine
out
and
had
not
much
time
yet
all
the
way
as
he
drove
along
the
streets
just
as
sunset
was
over
and
a
subduing
shade
came
over
the
light
and
that
look
that
comes
with
evening
he
kept
thinking
of
the
fat
letter
upon
his
table
do
you
know
anything
of
the
man
that
would
no
longer
be
the
refrain
of
his
correspondent
but
some
absurd
strain
of
devotion
and
admiration
of
the
man
whom
john
knew
nothing
of
not
even
his
name
he
wondered
as
he
went
along
in
his
hansom
and
even
between
the
courses
at
dinner
while
he
listened
with
a
smile
but
without
hearing
a
word
to
what
the
lady
next
him
was
saying
what
she
would
tell
him
about
this
man
that
he
was
everything
that
was
delightful
no
doubt
handsome
of
course
probably
clever
and
that
she
was
fond
of
him
confound
the
fellow
elinor
to
think
that
she
should
come
to
that
a
girl
like
her
to
tell
him
as
if
she
was
saying
that
she
had
caught
a
cold
or
received
a
present
that
she
was
in
love
with
a
man
good
heavens
when
one
had
thought
her
so
much
above
anything
of
that
kind
a
woman
above
all
women
that
ever
were
not
so
much
as
that
john
said
to
himself
as
he
walked
home
he
always
preferred
to
walk
home
in
the
evening
and
he
was
not
going
to
change
his
habit
now
out
of
any
curiosity
about
elinor
letter
oh
not
so
much
as
that
not
above
all
women
or
better
than
the
rest
perhaps
but
different
he
could
not
quite
explain
to
himself
how
except
that
he
had
always
known
her
to
be
elinor
and
not
another
which
was
a
quite
sufficient
explanation
and
now
it
appeared
that
she
was
not
different
although
she
would
still
profess
to
be
elinor
a
curious
puzzle
which
his
brain
in
its
excited
state
was
scarcely
able
to
tackle
his
thoughts
got
somewhat
confused
and
broken
as
he
approached
his
chambers
he
was
so
near
the
letter
now
a
few
minutes
and
he
would
no
longer
need
to
wonder
or
speculate
about
it
but
would
know
exactly
what
she
said
he
turned
and
stood
for
a
minute
or
so
at
the
temple
gates
looking
out
upon
the
busy
strand
it
was
still
as
lovely
as
a
summer
night
could
be
overhead
but
down
here
it
was
well
it
was
london
which
is
another
thing
the
usual
crowd
was
streaming
by
coming
into
bright
light
as
it
streamed
past
a
brilliant
shop
window
then
in
the
shade
for
another
moment
and
emerging
again
the
faces
that
were
suddenly
lit
up
as
they
passed
some
handsome
faces
pale
in
the
light
some
with
heads
hung
down
either
in
bad
health
or
bad
humour
some
full
of
cares
and
troubles
others
airy
and
gay
caught
his
attention
did
any
of
them
all
know
anything
of
this
man
he
wondered
knowing
how
absurd
a
question
it
was
had
any
of
them
written
a
letter
full
of
explanations
of
a
matter
that
could
not
be
explained
there
were
faces
with
far
more
tragic
meaning
in
them
than
could
be
so
easily
explained
as
that
the
faces
of
men
alas
and
women
too
who
were
going
to
destruction
as
fast
as
their
hurrying
feet
could
carry
them
or
else
were
languidly
drifting
no
one
knew
where
out
of
life
altogether
out
of
all
that
was
good
in
life
john
tatham
knew
this
very
well
too
and
had
it
in
him
to
do
anything
a
man
could
to
stop
the
wanderers
in
their
downward
career
but
he
was
thinking
of
none
of
these
things
he
was
only
wondering
how
she
would
explain
it
how
she
could
explain
it
what
she
would
say
and
lingering
to
prolong
his
suspense
not
to
know
too
soon
what
it
was
at
last
however
as
there
is
no
delay
but
must
come
to
an
end
one
time
or
another
he
found
himself
at
last
in
his
room
in
his
and
slippers
divested
of
his
stiff
collar
at
his
ease
the
windows
open
upon
the
quiet
of
the
temple
gardens
a
little
fresh
air
breathing
in
he
had
taken
all
this
trouble
to
secure
ease
for
himself
to
put
off
a
little
the
reading
of
the
letter
now
the
moment
had
come
when
it
would
be
absurd
to
delay
any
longer
it
was
so
natural
to
see
her
familiar
handwriting
not
a
lady
hand
angular
and
pointed
like
her
mother
but
the
handwriting
of
her
generation
which
looks
as
if
it
were
full
of
character
until
one
perceives
that
it
the
writing
of
the
generation
and
all
the
girls
and
boys
write
much
the
same
he
took
time
for
this
reflection
still
as
he
tore
open
the
envelope
there
were
two
sheets
very
well
filled
and
written
in
at
the
corners
so
that
no
available
spot
was
lost
my
dear
old
john
were
the
first
words
he
saw
he
put
down
the
letter
and
thought
over
the
address
well
she
had
always
called
him
so
he
was
old
john
when
he
was
fourteen
to
little
elinor
they
had
always
known
each
other
like
that
like
brother
and
sister
but
not
particularly
like
brother
and
sister
like
cousins
twice
removed
which
is
a
more
interesting
tie
in
some
particulars
and
now
for
the
letter
my
dear
old
john
i
want
to
tell
you
myself
of
a
great
thing
that
has
happened
to
me
the
very
greatest
thing
that
could
happen
in
life
oh
john
dear
old
john
i
feel
as
if
i
had
nobody
else
i
could
open
my
heart
to
for
mamma
well
mamma
is
mamma
a
dear
mother
and
a
good
one
but
you
know
she
has
her
own
ways
of
thinking
he
put
down
the
letter
again
with
a
rueful
little
laugh
and
have
not
i
my
own
ways
of
thinking
too
he
said
to
himself
jack
dear
continued
the
letter
you
must
give
me
your
sympathy
all
your
sympathy
you
never
were
in
love
i
suppose
oh
what
an
odious
way
that
is
of
putting
it
but
it
spares
one
feelings
a
little
for
even
in
writing
it
is
too
tremendous
a
thing
to
say
quite
gravely
and
seriously
as
one
feels
it
dear
john
i
know
you
never
were
in
love
or
you
would
have
told
me
but
still
oh
he
said
to
himself
with
the
merest
suspicion
of
a
little
quiver
in
his
lip
which
might
of
course
have
been
a
laugh
but
on
the
other
hand
might
have
been
something
else
i
never
was
or
i
would
have
told
her
that
the
way
she
looks
at
it
then
he
took
up
the
letter
again
because
i
see
nothing
but
persecution
before
me
it
was
only
a
week
ago
that
it
happened
and
we
wanted
to
keep
it
quiet
for
a
time
but
things
get
out
in
spite
of
all
one
can
do
things
of
that
sort
at
least
and
oh
dear
jack
fancy
i
have
got
three
letters
already
all
warning
me
against
him
raking
up
trifling
things
that
have
occurred
long
ago
long
before
he
met
me
and
holding
them
up
before
me
like
scarecrows
telling
me
he
is
not
worthy
of
me
and
that
i
will
be
wretched
if
i
marry
him
and
other
dreadful
lies
like
that
which
show
me
quite
plainly
that
they
neither
know
him
nor
me
and
that
they
have
eyes
to
see
what
he
really
is
nor
minds
to
understand
but
though
i
see
the
folly
of
it
and
the
wickedness
of
it
mamma
does
not
she
is
ready
to
take
other
people
words
indeed
there
is
this
to
be
said
for
her
that
she
does
not
know
him
yet
and
therefore
can
not
be
expected
to
be
ready
to
take
his
own
word
before
all
dear
jack
my
heart
is
so
full
and
i
have
so
much
to
tell
you
and
such
perfect
confidence
in
your
sympathy
and
also
in
your
insight
and
capacity
to
see
through
all
the
lies
and
wicked
stories
which
i
foresee
are
going
to
be
poured
upon
us
like
a
flood
that
i
do
know
how
to
begin
i
have
so
many
things
to
say
i
know
it
is
the
heart
of
the
season
and
that
you
are
asked
out
every
night
in
the
week
and
are
so
popular
everywhere
but
if
you
could
but
come
down
from
saturday
to
monday
and
let
me
tell
you
everything
and
show
you
his
picture
and
read
you
parts
of
his
letters
i
know
you
would
see
how
false
and
wrong
it
all
is
and
help
me
to
face
it
out
with
all
those
horrid
people
and
to
bring
round
mamma
you
know
her
dreadful
way
of
never
giving
an
opinion
but
just
saying
a
great
deal
worse
and
leaving
you
to
your
own
responsibility
which
nearly
drives
me
mad
even
in
little
things
so
you
may
suppose
what
it
does
in
this
of
course
she
must
see
him
which
is
all
i
want
for
i
know
after
she
has
had
a
conversation
with
him
that
she
will
be
like
me
and
will
not
believe
a
word
not
one
word
therefore
jack
dear
come
oh
come
i
have
always
turned
to
you
in
my
difficulties
since
ever
i
have
known
what
it
was
to
have
a
difficulty
and
you
have
done
everything
for
me
i
never
remember
any
trouble
i
ever
had
but
you
found
some
means
of
clearing
it
away
therefore
my
whole
hope
is
in
you
i
know
it
is
hard
to
give
up
all
your
parties
and
things
but
it
would
only
be
two
nights
after
all
saturday
and
sunday
oh
do
come
do
come
if
you
ever
cared
the
least
little
bit
for
your
poor
cousin
come
oh
come
dear
old
john
your
affect
e
is
that
all
he
said
to
himself
but
it
was
not
all
for
there
followed
a
postscript
all
about
the
gifts
and
graces
of
the
unknown
lover
and
how
he
was
the
victim
of
circumstances
and
how
while
other
men
might
steal
the
horse
he
dared
not
look
over
the
wall
and
other
convincing
pleadings
such
as
these
till
john
head
began
to
go
round
when
he
had
got
through
this
postscript
john
tatham
folded
the
letter
and
put
it
away
he
had
a
smile
on
his
face
but
he
had
the
air
of
a
man
who
had
been
beaten
about
the
head
and
was
confused
with
the
hurry
and
storm
of
the
blows
she
had
always
turned
to
him
in
all
her
difficulties
that
was
true
and
he
had
always
stood
by
her
and
often
in
the
freemasonry
of
youth
had
thought
her
right
and
vindicated
her
capacity
to
judge
for
herself
he
had
been
called
often
on
this
errand
and
he
had
never
refused
to
obey
for
elinor
was
very
wilful
she
had
always
been
wilful
a
rosebud
set
about
with
wilful
thorns
but
sweet
as
english
air
could
make
her
she
he
had
come
to
her
aid
many
a
time
but
he
had
never
thought
to
be
called
upon
by
her
in
such
a
way
as
this
he
folded
the
letter
up
carefully
and
put
it
in
a
drawer
usually
when
he
had
a
letter
from
elinor
he
put
it
into
his
pocket
for
the
satisfaction
of
reading
it
over
again
for
she
had
a
fantastic
way
of
writing
adding
little
postscripts
which
escaped
the
eye
at
first
and
which
it
was
pleasant
to
find
out
afterwards
but
with
this
letter
he
did
not
do
so
he
put
it
in
a
drawer
of
his
so
that
he
might
find
it
again
when
necessary
but
he
did
not
put
it
in
his
breast
pocket
and
then
he
sat
for
some
time
doing
nothing
looking
before
him
with
his
legs
stretched
out
and
his
hand
beating
a
little
tattoo
upon
the
table
well
well
well
that
was
about
what
he
said
to
himself
but
it
meant
a
great
deal
it
meant
a
vague
but
great
disappointment
a
sort
of
blank
and
vacuum
expressed
by
the
first
of
these
words
and
then
it
meant
a
question
of
great
importance
and
many
divisions
how
could
it
ever
have
come
to
anything
am
i
a
man
to
marry
what
could
i
have
done
just
getting
into
practice
just
getting
a
few
pounds
to
spend
for
myself
and
then
came
the
conclusion
since
i
ca
do
anything
else
for
her
since
she
done
it
for
herself
shall
i
be
a
beast
and
not
help
her
because
it
puts
my
own
nose
out
of
joint
not
a
bit
of
it
the
reader
must
remember
that
in
venturing
to
reflect
a
young
sentiments
a
dignified
style
is
scarcely
possible
they
express
themselves
sometimes
with
much
force
in
their
private
moments
but
not
as
johnson
would
have
approved
or
with
any
sense
of
elegance
and
one
must
try
to
be
truthful
to
nature
he
knew
very
well
that
elinor
was
not
responsible
for
his
disappointment
and
even
he
was
aware
that
if
she
had
been
so
foolish
as
to
fix
her
hopes
upon
him
it
would
probably
have
been
she
who
would
have
been
disappointed
and
left
in
the
lurch
but
still
john
had
gone
through
an
interminable
amount
of
thinking
and
a
good
deal
of
with
or
without
how
should
i
know
some
other
moderate
ingredient
and
a
cigar
or
two
not
to
speak
of
certain
hours
when
he
ought
to
have
been
in
bed
to
keep
his
head
clear
for
the
cases
of
when
it
suddenly
flashed
upon
him
all
at
once
that
he
was
not
a
step
further
on
than
when
he
had
received
dennistoun
letter
in
the
morning
for
elinor
though
she
had
said
so
much
about
him
had
given
no
indication
who
her
lover
was
who
was
the
man
chapter
ii
it
was
a
blustering
afternoon
when
john
with
his
bag
in
his
hand
set
out
from
the
station
at
hurrymere
for
dennistoun
cottage
why
that
station
should
have
had
mere
in
its
name
i
have
never
been
able
to
divine
for
there
is
no
water
to
be
seen
for
miles
scarcely
so
much
as
a
duckpond
but
perhaps
there
are
two
meanings
to
the
words
it
was
a
steep
walk
up
a
succession
of
slopes
and
the
name
of
the
one
upon
which
the
cottage
stood
was
windyhill
not
an
encouraging
title
on
such
a
day
but
true
enough
to
the
character
of
the
place
the
cottage
lay
however
at
the
head
of
a
combe
or
shelving
irregular
valley
just
sheltered
from
the
winds
on
a
little
platform
of
its
own
and
commanding
a
view
which
was
delightful
in
its
long
sweeping
distance
and
varied
enough
to
be
called
picturesque
especially
by
those
who
were
familiar
with
nothing
higher
than
the
swelling
slopes
of
the
surrey
hills
it
was
wild
little
cultivated
save
in
the
emerald
green
of
the
bottom
a
few
fields
which
lay
where
a
stream
ought
to
have
been
nowadays
there
are
houses
peeping
out
at
every
corner
but
at
that
period
fashion
had
not
even
heard
of
hurrymere
and
save
for
a
or
two
a
village
alehouse
and
at
a
corner
of
the
and
one
or
two
great
houses
within
the
circuit
of
six
or
seven
miles
retired
within
their
trees
and
parks
there
were
few
habitations
dennistoun
cottage
was
like
the
rest
but
much
subdued
by
lichens
and
its
walls
were
covered
by
climbing
plants
so
that
it
struck
no
bold
note
upon
the
wild
landscape
yet
was
visible
afar
off
in
glimpses
from
the
road
for
a
mile
or
two
before
it
could
be
come
at
there
was
indeed
a
nearer
way
necessitating
a
sharp
scramble
but
when
john
came
just
in
sight
of
the
house
his
heart
failed
him
a
little
and
notwithstanding
that
his
bag
had
come
to
feel
very
heavy
by
this
time
he
deliberately
chose
the
longer
round
to
gain
a
little
time
as
we
all
do
sometimes
when
we
are
most
anxious
to
be
at
our
journey
end
and
hear
what
has
to
be
told
us
it
looked
very
peaceful
seated
in
that
fold
of
the
hill
no
tossing
of
trees
about
it
though
a
little
higher
up
the
slim
oaks
and
beeches
of
the
copse
were
flinging
themselves
about
against
the
grey
sky
in
a
kind
of
agonised
appeal
john
liked
the
sound
of
the
wind
sweeping
over
the
hills
rending
the
trees
and
filling
the
horizon
as
with
a
crowd
of
shadows
in
pain
twisting
and
bending
with
every
fresh
sweep
of
the
breeze
sometimes
such
sounds
and
sights
give
a
relief
to
the
mind
he
liked
it
better
than
if
all
had
been
undisturbed
lying
in
afternoon
quiet
as
might
have
been
expected
at
the
crown
of
the
year
but
the
winds
had
always
to
be
taken
into
account
at
windyhill
when
he
came
in
sight
of
the
gate
john
was
aware
of
some
one
waiting
for
him
walking
up
and
down
the
sandy
road
into
which
it
opened
her
face
was
turned
the
other
way
and
she
evidently
looked
for
him
by
way
of
the
combe
the
scrambling
steep
road
which
he
had
avoided
in
despite
for
why
should
he
scramble
and
make
himself
hot
in
order
to
hear
ten
minutes
sooner
what
he
did
not
wish
to
hear
at
all
she
turned
round
suddenly
as
he
knocked
his
foot
against
a
stone
upon
the
rough
but
otherwise
noiseless
road
presenting
a
countenance
flushed
with
sudden
relief
and
pleasure
to
john
remorseful
eye
oh
there
you
are
she
said
i
am
so
glad
i
thought
you
could
not
be
coming
you
might
have
been
here
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
by
the
short
road
i
did
not
think
there
was
any
hurry
said
john
ungraciously
the
wind
is
enough
to
carry
one
off
one
feet
though
to
be
sure
quiet
enough
here
it
always
quiet
here
she
said
reading
his
face
with
her
eyes
after
the
manner
of
women
and
wondering
what
the
harassed
look
meant
that
was
so
unusual
in
john
cheerful
face
she
jumped
at
the
idea
that
he
was
tired
that
his
bag
was
heavy
that
he
had
been
beaten
about
by
the
wind
till
he
had
lost
his
temper
always
a
possible
thing
to
happen
to
a
man
elinor
flung
herself
upon
the
bag
and
tried
to
take
possession
of
it
why
did
you
get
a
boy
at
the
station
to
carry
it
let
me
carry
it
she
said
that
is
so
likely
said
john
with
a
hard
laugh
shifting
it
to
his
other
hand
elinor
caught
his
arm
with
both
her
hands
and
looked
up
with
wistful
eyes
into
his
face
oh
john
you
are
angry
she
said
nonsense
i
am
tired
buffeting
about
with
this
wind
here
the
gardener
and
about
the
cottage
came
up
and
took
the
bag
which
john
parted
with
with
angry
reluctance
as
if
it
had
been
a
sort
of
weapon
of
offence
after
it
was
gone
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
walk
quietly
to
the
house
through
the
flowers
with
that
girl
hanging
on
his
arm
begging
a
hundred
pardons
with
her
eyes
the
folly
of
it
as
if
she
had
not
a
right
to
do
as
she
pleased
or
he
would
try
to
prevent
her
but
finally
the
soft
silent
apology
of
that
clinging
and
the
look
full
of
petitions
touched
his
surly
heart
well
nelly
he
said
with
involuntary
softening
oh
if
you
call
me
that
i
am
not
afraid
she
cried
with
an
instant
upleaping
of
pleasure
and
confidence
in
her
changeable
face
which
john
tried
to
say
to
himself
was
not
really
pretty
at
all
only
so
full
of
expression
changing
with
every
breath
of
feeling
the
eyes
which
had
only
been
brown
a
moment
before
leaped
up
into
globes
of
light
yet
not
too
dazzling
with
some
liquid
medium
to
soften
their
shining
even
though
you
know
that
a
girl
is
in
love
with
another
man
that
she
thinks
of
you
no
more
than
of
the
old
gardener
who
has
just
hobbled
round
the
corner
it
is
pleasant
to
be
able
to
change
the
whole
aspect
of
affairs
to
her
and
make
her
light
up
like
that
solely
by
a
little
unwilling
softening
of
your
gruff
and
surly
tone
you
know
john
she
said
holding
his
arm
tight
with
her
two
hands
that
nobody
ever
calls
me
nelly
except
you
possibly
i
shall
call
you
nelly
no
longer
why
why
because
that
fellow
will
object
that
fellow
oh
elinor
face
grew
very
red
all
over
from
the
chin
which
almost
touched
john
arm
to
the
forehead
bent
back
a
little
over
those
eyes
suffused
with
light
which
were
intent
upon
all
the
changes
of
john
face
this
one
was
like
the
landscape
swept
by
all
the
vicissitudes
of
sun
and
shade
it
was
radiant
now
with
the
unexpected
splendour
of
the
sudden
gleam
oh
john
john
i
have
so
much
to
say
to
you
he
will
object
to
nothing
he
knows
very
well
you
are
like
my
brother
almost
more
than
my
brother
for
you
could
help
it
john
you
almost
chose
me
for
your
friend
which
a
brother
would
not
he
says
him
to
be
our
friend
and
all
will
be
well
had
not
said
this
but
elinor
had
said
it
to
him
and
he
had
assented
which
was
almost
the
same
in
the
way
of
reckoning
of
a
girl
at
least
he
is
very
kind
i
am
sure
said
john
gulping
down
something
which
had
almost
made
him
throw
off
elinor
arm
and
fling
away
from
her
in
indignation
her
brother
but
there
was
no
use
making
any
row
he
said
to
himself
if
anything
were
to
be
done
for
her
he
must
put
up
with
all
that
there
had
suddenly
come
upon
john
he
knew
not
how
as
he
scanned
her
anxious
face
a
conviction
that
the
man
was
a
scamp
from
whom
at
all
hazards
she
should
be
free
said
elinor
unsuspecting
that
is
just
what
he
is
john
i
knew
you
would
divine
his
character
at
once
you
ca
think
how
kind
he
is
kind
to
everybody
he
never
judges
anyone
or
throws
a
stone
or
makes
an
insinuation
probably
because
he
knows
he
can
not
bear
investigation
himself
john
said
in
his
heart
that
was
the
thing
that
took
my
heart
first
everybody
is
so
censorious
always
something
to
say
against
their
neighbours
he
never
a
word
that
a
very
good
quality
said
john
reluctantly
if
it
mean
confounding
good
with
bad
and
thinking
nothing
matters
elinor
gave
him
a
grieved
reproachful
look
and
loosened
the
clasping
of
her
hands
it
is
not
like
you
to
imagine
that
john
well
what
is
a
man
to
say
do
you
see
if
you
do
nothing
but
blow
his
trumpet
the
only
thing
left
for
me
to
do
is
to
insinuate
something
against
him
i
do
know
the
man
from
adam
he
may
be
an
angel
for
anything
i
can
say
no
i
do
not
pretend
he
is
that
said
elinor
with
impartiality
he
has
his
faults
like
others
but
they
are
faults
he
does
know
how
to
take
care
of
his
money
but
he
has
got
very
much
which
makes
it
the
less
matter
and
he
is
sometimes
taken
in
about
his
friends
anybody
almost
that
appeals
to
his
kindness
is
treated
like
a
friend
which
makes
precise
people
think
but
of
course
i
do
share
that
opinion
in
the
very
least
a
very
wasteful
beggar
with
a
disreputable
set
was
john
practical
comment
within
himself
upon
this
speech
and
he
does
know
how
to
curry
favour
with
people
who
can
help
him
on
so
that
though
he
has
been
for
years
promised
something
it
never
turns
up
oh
i
know
his
faults
very
well
indeed
said
elinor
but
a
woman
can
do
so
much
to
make
up
for
faults
like
that
we
naturally
saving
you
know
and
we
always
keep
those
unnecessary
friends
that
were
made
before
our
time
at
a
distance
and
it
part
of
our
nature
to
coax
a
patron
that
is
what
mariamne
says
mariamne
said
john
his
sister
who
first
introduced
him
to
me
and
i
am
very
fond
of
her
so
you
need
not
say
anything
against
her
john
i
know
she
is
fashionable
but
that
no
harm
mariamne
he
repeated
it
is
a
very
uncommon
name
you
do
mean
lady
mariamne
prestwich
do
you
and
not
not
elinor
not
phil
compton
for
goodness
sake
do
tell
me
he
the
man
elinor
hands
dropped
from
his
arm
she
drew
herself
up
until
she
seemed
to
tower
over
him
and
why
should
i
say
it
is
not
compton
she
asked
with
a
scarlet
flush
of
anger
so
different
from
that
rosy
red
of
love
and
happiness
covering
her
face
phil
compton
the
phil
why
elinor
you
can
not
mean
it
you
must
not
mean
it
he
cried
elinor
said
not
a
word
she
turned
from
him
with
a
look
of
pathetic
reproach
but
with
the
air
of
a
queen
and
walked
into
the
house
he
following
in
a
ferment
of
wrath
and
trouble
yet
humbled
and
miserable
more
than
words
could
say
oh
the
flowery
peaceful
house
jasmine
and
rose
overleaping
each
other
upon
the
porch
honeysuckle
scenting
the
air
all
manner
of
feminine
contrivances
to
continue
the
greenness
and
the
sweetness
into
the
little
bright
hall
into
the
open
where
flowers
stood
on
every
table
amid
the
hundred
pretty
trifles
of
a
woman
house
there
was
no
one
in
this
room
where
she
led
him
and
then
turned
round
confronting
him
taller
than
he
had
ever
seen
her
before
pale
with
her
nostrils
dilating
and
her
lips
trembling
i
never
thought
it
possible
that
you
of
all
people
in
the
world
you
john
my
since
ever
i
was
a
baby
my
oh
what
a
horrid
thing
it
is
to
be
a
woman
cried
elinor
stamping
her
foot
to
be
ready
to
cry
for
everything
you
john
that
i
always
put
my
trust
in
that
you
should
turn
against
me
and
at
the
very
first
word
elinor
he
said
my
dear
girl
not
against
you
not
against
you
for
all
the
world
and
what
is
she
said
with
that
sudden
turning
of
the
tables
and
high
scorn
of
her
previous
argument
which
is
common
with
women
do
i
care
what
you
do
to
oh
nothing
nothing
i
am
of
no
account
you
can
trample
me
down
under
your
feet
if
you
like
but
what
i
will
not
bear
she
said
clenching
her
hands
is
injustice
to
him
that
i
will
not
bear
neither
from
you
cousin
john
who
are
only
my
distant
cousin
after
all
and
have
no
right
to
thrust
your
advice
upon
me
or
from
any
one
in
the
world
what
you
say
is
quite
true
elinor
i
am
only
a
distant
cousin
after
all
but
oh
no
no
she
cried
flying
to
him
seizing
once
more
his
arm
with
her
clinging
hands
i
did
not
mean
that
you
know
i
did
not
mean
that
my
more
than
brother
my
good
good
john
whom
i
have
trusted
all
my
life
and
then
the
poor
girl
broke
out
into
passionate
weeping
with
her
head
upon
his
shoulder
as
she
might
have
leant
upon
the
handy
trunk
of
a
tree
or
on
the
nearest
door
or
window
as
john
tatham
said
in
his
heart
he
soothed
her
as
best
he
could
and
put
her
in
a
chair
and
stood
with
his
hand
upon
the
back
of
it
looking
down
upon
her
as
the
fit
of
crying
wore
itself
out
poor
little
girl
he
had
seen
her
cry
often
enough
before
a
girl
cries
for
anything
for
a
thorn
in
her
finger
for
a
twist
of
her
foot
he
had
seen
her
cry
and
laugh
and
dash
the
tears
out
of
her
eyes
on
such
occasions
oh
often
and
often
there
was
that
time
when
he
rushed
out
of
the
bushes
unexpectedly
and
frightened
her
pony
and
she
fell
among
the
grass
and
vowed
sobbing
and
laughing
it
was
her
fault
and
once
when
she
was
a
little
tot
not
old
enough
for
boy
play
when
she
fell
upon
her
little
nose
and
cut
it
and
disfigured
herself
and
held
up
that
wounded
little
knob
of
a
feature
to
have
it
kissed
and
made
well
oh
why
did
he
think
of
that
now
the
little
thing
all
trust
and
simple
confidence
there
was
that
time
too
when
she
jumped
up
to
get
a
gun
and
shoot
the
tramps
who
had
hurt
somebody
if
john
would
but
give
her
his
hand
these
things
came
rushing
into
his
mind
as
he
stood
watching
elinor
cry
with
his
hand
upon
the
back
of
her
chair
she
wanted
john
hand
now
when
she
was
going
forth
to
far
greater
dangers
oh
poor
little
nelly
poor
little
thing
but
he
could
not
put
her
on
his
shoulder
and
carry
her
out
to
face
the
foe
now
she
jumped
up
suddenly
while
he
was
thinking
with
the
tears
still
wet
upon
her
cheeks
but
the
paroxysm
mastered
and
the
light
of
her
eyes
coming
out
doubly
bright
like
the
sun
from
the
clouds
we
poor
women
she
said
with
a
laugh
are
so
badly
off
we
are
so
handicapped
as
you
call
it
we
ca
help
crying
like
fools
we
ca
help
caring
for
what
other
people
think
trying
to
conciliate
and
bring
them
round
to
approve
us
when
we
ought
to
stand
by
our
own
conscience
and
judgment
and
sense
of
what
is
right
like
independent
beings
if
that
means
taking
your
own
way
elinor
whatever
any
one
may
say
to
you
i
think
women
do
it
at
least
as
much
as
men
no
it
does
not
mean
taking
our
own
way
she
cried
and
if
you
do
not
understand
any
better
than
that
why
should
i
but
you
do
understand
better
john
she
said
her
countenance
again
softening
you
know
i
want
above
everything
in
the
world
that
you
should
approve
of
me
and
see
that
i
am
right
that
is
what
i
want
i
will
do
what
i
think
right
but
oh
if
i
could
only
have
you
with
me
in
doing
it
and
know
that
you
saw
with
me
that
it
was
the
best
the
only
thing
to
do
happiness
lies
in
that
not
in
having
one
own
way
my
dear
elinor
he
said
is
that
asking
a
great
deal
to
prevent
you
from
doing
what
you
think
right
is
in
nobody
power
you
are
of
age
and
i
am
sure
my
aunt
will
force
nothing
but
how
can
we
change
our
opinions
our
convictions
our
entire
points
of
view
there
is
nobody
in
the
world
i
would
do
so
much
for
as
you
elinor
but
i
can
not
do
that
even
for
you
the
hot
tears
were
dried
from
her
cheeks
the
passion
was
over
she
looked
at
him
her
efforts
to
gain
him
at
an
end
on
the
equal
footing
of
an
independent
individual
agreeing
to
differ
and
as
strong
in
her
own
view
as
he
could
be
there
is
one
thing
you
can
do
for
me
she
said
mamma
knows
nothing
about
fashionable
gossip
she
is
not
acquainted
with
the
wicked
things
that
are
said
if
she
disapproves
it
is
only
because
oh
i
suppose
because
one
mother
always
disapproves
a
thing
that
is
done
without
her
that
she
has
no
hand
in
what
she
calls
pledging
one
self
to
a
stranger
and
not
knowing
his
antecedents
his
circumstances
and
so
forth
but
she
has
any
definite
ground
for
it
as
you
think
you
have
judging
in
the
uncharitable
way
of
the
world
not
remembering
that
if
we
love
one
another
the
more
there
is
against
him
the
more
need
he
has
of
me
but
all
i
have
to
ask
of
you
john
is
not
to
prejudice
my
mother
i
know
you
can
do
it
if
you
please
a
hint
would
be
enough
an
uncertain
word
even
hesitating
when
you
answer
a
question
that
would
be
quite
enough
john
if
you
put
things
into
her
head
you
ask
most
extraordinary
things
of
me
said
john
turning
to
bay
to
tell
her
lies
about
a
man
whom
everybody
knows
to
pretend
i
think
one
thing
when
i
think
quite
another
not
to
say
that
my
duty
is
to
inform
her
exactly
what
things
are
said
so
that
she
may
judge
for
herself
not
let
her
go
forth
in
ignorance
that
is
my
plain
duty
elinor
but
you
wo
do
it
oh
you
wo
do
it
she
said
oh
john
for
the
sake
of
all
the
time
that
you
have
been
so
good
to
nelly
your
own
little
nelly
nobody
else
remember
that
i
and
everybody
who
loves
him
know
these
stories
to
be
lies
and
do
do
put
things
into
my
mother
head
let
her
judge
for
herself
do
do
prejudice
her
john
it
can
be
no
one
duty
to
repeat
malicious
stories
when
there
is
no
possibility
of
proving
or
disproving
them
do
make
her
think
oh
mamma
we
could
think
where
you
had
gone
to
yes
here
is
john
so
i
perceive
said
dennistoun
it
was
getting
towards
evening
and
the
room
was
not
very
light
she
could
not
distinguish
their
looks
or
the
agitation
that
scarcely
could
have
been
hidden
but
for
the
dusk
you
seem
to
have
been
having
a
very
animated
conversation
i
heard
your
voices
all
along
the
garden
walk
let
me
have
the
benefit
of
it
if
there
is
anything
to
tell
you
know
well
enough
mamma
what
we
must
have
been
talking
about
said
elinor
turning
half
angrily
away
to
be
sure
said
the
mother
i
ought
to
have
known
there
is
nothing
so
interesting
as
that
sort
of
thing
i
thought
however
you
would
probably
have
put
it
off
a
little
elinor
put
it
off
a
little
when
it
is
the
thing
that
concerns
us
more
than
anything
else
in
the
world
that
is
true
said
dennistoun
with
a
sigh
did
you
walk
all
the
way
john
i
meant
to
have
sent
the
for
you
but
the
man
was
too
late
it
is
a
nice
evening
though
and
coming
out
of
town
it
is
a
good
thing
for
you
to
have
a
good
walk
yes
i
like
it
more
than
anything
said
john
but
the
evening
is
not
so
very
fine
the
wind
is
high
and
i
should
wonder
if
we
had
rain
the
wind
is
always
high
here
said
dennistoun
we
do
have
our
view
for
nothing
but
the
sky
is
quite
clear
in
the
west
and
all
the
clouds
blowing
away
i
do
think
we
shall
have
more
than
a
shower
elinor
stood
listening
to
this
talk
with
restrained
impatience
as
if
waiting
for
the
moment
when
they
should
come
to
something
worth
talking
about
then
she
gave
herself
a
sort
of
shake
half
weary
half
indignant
and
left
the
room
there
was
a
moment
silence
until
her
quick
step
was
heard
going
to
the
other
end
of
the
house
and
and
the
shutting
of
a
door
oh
john
i
am
very
uneasy
very
uneasy
said
dennistoun
i
scarcely
thought
she
would
have
begun
to
you
about
it
at
once
but
then
i
am
doing
the
very
same
we
ca
think
of
anything
else
i
am
not
going
to
worry
you
before
dinner
for
you
must
be
tired
with
your
walk
and
want
to
refresh
yourself
before
we
enter
upon
that
weary
weary
business
but
my
heart
misgives
me
dreadfully
about
it
all
if
i
only
had
gone
with
her
it
was
not
for
want
of
an
invitation
but
just
my
laziness
i
could
not
be
troubled
to
leave
my
own
house
i
do
see
what
difference
it
would
have
made
had
you
been
with
her
aunt
oh
i
should
have
seen
the
man
and
been
able
to
judge
what
he
was
and
his
motive
john
elinor
is
not
rich
he
could
scarcely
have
had
an
interested
motive
there
is
some
comfort
in
that
i
have
said
that
to
myself
again
and
again
he
could
not
have
an
interested
motive
but
oh
i
am
uneasy
there
is
the
i
will
not
keep
you
any
longer
john
but
in
the
evening
or
when
we
can
get
a
quiet
moment
the
dusk
was
now
pervading
all
the
house
that
summer
dusk
which
there
is
a
natural
prejudice
everywhere
against
cutting
short
by
lights
he
could
not
see
her
face
nor
she
his
as
they
went
out
of
the
together
and
along
the
long
passage
which
led
by
several
arched
doorways
to
the
stairs
john
had
a
room
on
the
ground
floor
which
was
kept
for
gentlemen
visitors
and
in
which
the
candles
were
twinkling
on
the
he
was
more
than
ever
thankful
as
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
himself
in
the
vague
reflected
world
of
the
mirror
with
its
lights
standing
up
reflected
too
like
inquisitors
spying
upon
him
that
there
had
not
been
light
enough
to
show
how
he
was
looking
for
though
he
was
both
a
lawyer
and
a
man
of
the
world
john
tatham
had
not
been
able
to
keep
the
trouble
which
his
interview
with
elinor
had
caused
him
out
of
his
face
chapter
iii
the
of
the
cottage
was
large
and
low
and
had
that
of
being
which
is
dear
to
the
hearts
of
superior
people
generally
dennistoun
and
her
daughter
scarcely
belonged
to
that
class
yet
they
were
as
ladies
of
leisure
with
a
little
taste
for
the
arts
are
bound
to
be
touched
by
all
the
fancies
of
their
time
which
was
just
beginning
to
adore
queen
anne
there
was
still
however
a
mixture
of
luxury
with
the
square
settees
and
cabinets
which
were
the
fashion
and
partly
because
that
was
also
the
fashion
and
partly
because
on
windyhill
even
a
july
evening
was
sometimes
a
little
chill
or
looked
so
by
reason
of
the
great
darkness
of
the
silent
country
outside
there
was
a
log
burning
on
the
the
newest
thing
in
furnishing
in
those
days
though
now
so
common
on
the
hearth
the
log
burned
as
little
as
possible
being
perhaps
not
quite
so
thoroughly
dry
and
serviceable
as
it
would
have
been
in
its
proper
period
and
made
a
faint
hissing
sound
in
the
silence
as
it
burned
and
diffused
its
pungent
odour
through
the
house
the
bow
window
was
open
behind
its
white
curtains
and
it
was
there
that
the
little
party
gathered
out
of
reach
of
the
unnecessary
heat
and
the
smoke
there
was
a
low
sofa
on
either
side
of
this
recess
and
in
the
centre
the
french
window
opened
into
the
garden
where
all
the
scents
were
balmy
in
the
stillness
which
had
fallen
upon
the
night
dennistoun
was
tall
and
slim
a
woman
with
a
presence
and
sat
with
a
sort
of
dignity
on
her
side
of
the
window
with
a
little
table
beside
her
covered
with
her
little
requirements
the
properties
so
to
speak
without
which
she
was
never
known
to
be
a
book
for
moments
when
there
was
nothing
else
to
interest
her
a
case
for
work
should
there
arise
any
necessity
for
putting
in
a
stitch
in
time
a
bottle
of
salts
should
she
or
any
one
else
become
suddenly
faint
a
paper
cutter
in
cases
of
emergency
and
finally
for
mere
ornament
two
roses
a
red
and
a
white
in
one
of
those
tall
glasses
which
are
so
pretty
for
flowers
i
do
wrong
to
dismiss
the
roses
with
such
vulgar
qualifications
as
white
and
red
the
one
was
a
de
the
other
a
something
or
other
if
you
spoke
to
dennistoun
about
her
flowers
she
said
oh
the
malmaison
or
oh
the
general
rose
was
only
the
family
name
but
happily
as
we
all
know
under
the
other
appellation
they
smelt
just
as
sweet
dennistoun
kept
up
all
this
little
state
because
she
had
been
used
to
do
so
because
it
was
part
of
a
lady
accoutrements
so
to
speak
she
had
also
a
cushion
which
was
necessary
if
not
for
comfort
yet
for
her
sense
of
being
fully
equipped
placed
behind
her
back
when
she
sat
down
but
with
all
this
she
was
not
a
formal
or
prim
person
she
was
a
woman
who
had
not
produced
a
great
deal
of
effect
in
life
one
of
those
who
are
not
accustomed
to
have
their
advice
taken
or
to
find
that
their
opinion
has
much
weight
upon
others
perhaps
it
was
because
elinor
resembled
her
father
that
this
peculiarity
which
had
affected
all
married
life
should
have
continued
into
a
sphere
where
she
ought
to
have
been
paramount
but
she
was
with
her
daughter
as
she
had
been
with
her
husband
a
person
of
an
ineffective
character
taking
refuge
from
the
sensation
of
being
unable
to
influence
those
about
her
whose
wills
were
stronger
than
her
own
by
relinquishing
authority
and
in
her
most
decided
moments
offering
an
opinion
only
no
more
this
was
not
because
she
was
really
undecided
for
on
the
contrary
she
knew
her
own
mind
well
enough
but
it
had
become
a
matter
of
habit
with
her
to
insist
upon
no
opinion
knowing
as
she
did
how
little
chance
she
had
of
imposing
her
opinion
upon
the
stronger
wills
about
her
she
had
two
other
children
older
than
elinor
one
the
eldest
of
all
married
in
india
a
woman
with
many
children
of
her
own
practically
altogether
severed
from
the
maternal
nest
the
other
an
adventurous
son
who
was
generally
understood
to
be
at
the
ends
of
the
earth
but
seldom
or
never
had
any
more
definite
address
this
lady
had
naturally
gone
through
many
pangs
and
anxieties
on
behalf
of
these
children
who
had
dropped
away
from
her
side
into
the
unknown
but
it
belonged
to
her
character
to
have
said
very
little
about
this
so
that
she
was
generally
supposed
to
take
things
very
easily
and
other
mothers
were
apt
to
admire
the
composure
of
dennistoun
whose
son
might
be
being
murdered
by
savages
at
any
moment
for
anything
she
knew
or
minded
apparently
now
it
would
have
driven
out
of
my
senses
the
other
ladies
said
dennistoun
perhaps
did
not
feel
the
back
so
well
fitted
to
the
burden
as
appeared
but
she
kept
her
own
sentiments
on
this
subject
entirely
to
herself
i
may
say
too
but
this
the
young
reader
may
skip
without
disadvantage
by
way
of
explanation
of
a
peculiarity
which
has
lately
been
much
remarked
as
characteristic
of
those
records
of
human
history
contemptuously
called
fiction
the
unimportance
or
or
unjust
disapproval
of
the
mother
in
records
of
this
description
that
it
is
almost
impossible
to
maintain
her
due
rank
and
character
in
a
piece
of
history
which
has
to
be
kept
within
certain
limits
and
where
her
daughter
the
heroine
must
have
the
first
place
to
lessen
by
dwelling
at
length
upon
the
mother
unless
that
mother
is
a
fool
or
a
termagant
or
something
thoroughly
contrasting
with
the
beauty
and
virtues
of
the
daughter
would
in
most
cases
be
a
mistake
in
art
for
one
thing
the
necessary
incidents
are
wanting
for
i
strongly
object
and
so
i
think
do
most
people
to
mothers
who
fall
in
love
or
think
of
marriage
or
any
such
vanity
in
their
own
person
and
unless
she
is
to
interfere
mischievously
with
the
young
lady
prospects
or
take
more
or
less
the
part
of
the
villain
how
is
she
to
be
permitted
any
importance
at
all
for
there
can
not
be
two
suns
in
one
sphere
or
two
centres
to
one
world
thus
the
mother
has
to
be
sacrificed
to
the
daughter
which
is
a
parable
or
else
it
is
the
other
way
which
is
against
all
the
principles
and
prepossessions
of
life
elinor
did
not
sit
up
like
her
mother
she
had
flung
herself
upon
the
opposite
sofa
with
her
arms
flung
behind
her
head
supporting
it
with
her
fingers
half
buried
in
the
twists
of
her
hair
she
was
not
tall
like
dennistoun
and
there
was
far
more
vivid
colour
than
had
ever
been
the
mother
in
her
brown
eyes
and
bright
complexion
which
was
and
after
an
rule
of
colour
too
crude
perhaps
for
modern
artistic
taste
sometimes
these
delightful
tints
go
with
a
placid
soul
which
never
varies
but
in
elinor
case
there
was
a
demon
in
the
hazel
of
the
eyes
not
dark
enough
for
placidity
all
fire
at
the
best
of
times
and
ready
in
a
moment
to
burst
into
flame
she
it
was
who
had
to
be
in
the
forefront
of
the
interest
and
not
her
mother
though
for
metaphysical
or
what
i
suppose
should
now
be
called
psychological
interests
the
elder
lady
was
probably
the
most
interesting
of
the
two
elinor
beat
her
foot
upon
the
carpet
out
of
sheer
impatience
while
john
lingered
alone
in
the
what
did
he
stay
there
for
when
there
are
several
men
together
and
they
drink
wine
the
thing
is
comprehensible
but
one
man
alone
who
takes
his
claret
with
his
dinner
and
cares
for
nothing
more
why
should
he
stay
behind
when
there
was
so
much
to
say
to
him
and
not
one
minute
too
much
time
till
monday
morning
should
the
house
be
given
up
to
talk
not
only
by
day
but
by
night
but
it
was
no
use
beating
one
foot
for
john
did
not
come
you
spoke
to
your
cousin
elinor
before
dinner
her
mother
said
oh
yes
i
spoke
to
him
before
dinner
what
did
he
come
here
for
but
that
i
sent
for
him
on
purpose
you
know
mamma
to
hear
what
he
would
say
and
what
did
he
say
this
most
natural
question
produced
a
small
convulsion
once
more
on
elinor
side
she
loosed
the
hands
that
had
been
supporting
her
head
and
flung
them
out
in
front
of
her
oh
mamma
how
can
you
be
so
exasperating
what
did
he
say
what
was
he
likely
to
say
if
the
beggar
maid
that
married
king
cophetua
had
a
family
it
would
have
been
exactly
the
same
thing
though
in
that
case
surely
the
advantage
was
all
on
the
gentleman
side
we
know
none
of
the
particulars
in
that
case
said
dennistoun
calmly
i
have
always
thought
it
quite
possible
that
the
beggar
maid
was
a
princess
of
an
old
dynasty
and
king
cophetua
a
but
in
your
case
elinor
you
know
just
as
little
said
the
girl
impetuously
that
is
what
i
say
i
do
know
the
man
who
has
possessed
himself
of
my
child
fancy
and
heart
i
want
to
know
more
about
him
i
want
for
goodness
sake
whatever
you
want
do
be
sentimental
mamma
was
i
sentimental
i
did
mean
it
he
has
got
your
heart
my
dear
whatever
words
may
be
used
yes
and
for
ever
said
the
girl
turning
round
upon
herself
i
know
you
think
i
do
know
my
own
mind
but
there
will
never
be
any
change
in
me
oh
what
does
john
mean
sitting
all
by
himself
in
that
stuffy
room
he
has
had
time
to
smoke
a
hundred
cigarettes
elinor
you
must
not
forget
it
is
rather
hard
upon
john
to
be
brought
down
to
settle
your
difficulties
for
you
what
do
you
want
with
him
only
that
he
should
advise
you
to
do
what
you
have
settled
upon
doing
if
he
took
the
other
side
how
much
attention
would
you
give
him
you
must
be
reasonable
my
dear
i
would
give
him
every
attention
said
elinor
if
he
said
what
was
reasonable
you
do
think
mere
blind
opposition
is
reasonable
i
hope
mamma
to
say
do
merely
without
saying
why
what
reason
is
there
in
that
my
dear
when
you
argue
i
am
lost
i
am
not
clever
at
making
out
my
ground
mine
is
not
mere
blind
opposition
or
indeed
opposition
at
all
you
have
been
always
trained
to
use
your
own
faculties
and
i
have
never
made
any
stand
against
you
why
not
why
not
said
the
girl
springing
to
her
feet
that
is
just
the
dreadful
dreadful
part
of
it
why
do
you
say
straight
out
what
i
am
to
do
and
keep
to
it
and
not
tell
me
i
must
make
use
of
my
own
faculties
when
i
do
you
put
on
a
face
and
object
either
do
object
or
tell
me
what
i
am
to
do
do
you
think
for
one
moment
if
i
did
you
would
obey
me
elinor
oh
i
do
know
what
i
might
do
in
that
case
for
it
will
never
happen
you
will
never
take
that
responsibility
for
my
part
if
you
locked
me
up
in
my
room
and
kept
me
on
bread
and
water
i
should
think
reasonable
but
not
this
kind
of
letting
i
dare
not
wait
upon
i
would
saying
i
am
to
exercise
my
own
faculties
and
then
hesitating
and
finding
fault
i
daresay
my
dear
said
dennistoun
with
great
tolerance
that
this
may
be
provoking
to
your
impatient
mind
but
you
must
put
yourself
in
my
place
a
little
as
i
try
to
put
myself
in
yours
i
have
never
seen
compton
it
is
probable
or
at
least
quite
possible
that
if
i
knew
him
i
might
look
upon
him
with
your
eyes
probable
possible
what
words
to
use
when
all
my
happiness
all
my
life
everything
i
care
for
is
in
it
and
my
own
mother
thinks
it
just
possible
that
she
might
be
able
to
tolerate
the
man
that
the
man
who
she
flung
herself
down
on
her
seat
again
panting
and
excited
did
you
wear
out
adelaide
like
that
she
cried
before
she
married
papa
and
you
adelaide
was
very
different
elinor
she
married
les
a
man
whom
we
all
knew
there
was
no
trouble
about
it
your
father
was
the
one
who
was
impatient
then
he
thought
it
too
well
arranged
too
commonplace
and
satisfactory
you
may
believe
he
did
not
object
to
that
in
words
but
he
laughed
at
them
and
it
worried
him
it
has
done
very
well
on
the
whole
said
dennistoun
with
a
faint
sigh
you
say
that
and
then
you
sigh
there
is
always
a
little
reserve
you
are
never
wholly
satisfied
one
seldom
is
in
this
world
said
dennistoun
this
time
with
a
soft
laugh
this
world
is
not
very
satisfactory
one
makes
the
best
one
can
of
it
and
that
is
just
what
i
hate
to
hear
said
elinor
what
i
have
always
heard
oh
yes
when
you
do
say
it
you
mean
it
mamma
one
can
read
it
in
the
turn
of
your
head
you
put
up
with
things
you
think
perhaps
they
might
have
been
worse
in
every
way
that
your
philosophy
and
it
killing
killing
to
all
life
i
would
rather
far
you
said
out
husband
is
a
prig
and
i
hate
him
there
is
only
one
drawback
that
it
would
not
be
true
i
do
in
the
least
hate
him
i
am
glad
i
was
not
called
upon
to
marry
him
myself
i
do
think
i
should
have
liked
it
but
he
makes
adelaide
a
very
good
husband
and
she
is
quite
happy
with
him
as
far
as
i
know
the
same
thing
again
never
more
i
wonder
i
wonder
after
i
have
been
married
a
dozen
years
what
you
will
say
of
me
i
wonder
too
if
we
could
but
know
that
it
would
solve
the
question
the
mother
said
elinor
looked
at
her
with
a
provoked
and
impatient
air
which
softened
off
after
a
moment
partly
because
she
heard
the
door
of
the
open
into
a
smile
i
try
you
in
every
way
she
said
half
laughing
i
do
everything
to
beguile
you
into
a
pleasanter
speech
i
thought
you
must
at
least
have
said
then
that
you
hoped
you
would
have
nothing
to
say
but
happiness
no
you
are
not
to
be
caught
however
one
tries
mamma
john
came
in
at
this
moment
not
without
a
whiff
about
him
of
the
cigarette
over
which
he
had
lingered
so
it
relieved
him
to
see
the
two
ladies
seated
opposite
each
other
in
the
bow
window
and
to
hear
something
like
a
laugh
in
the
air
perhaps
they
were
discussing
other
things
and
not
this
momentous
marriage
question
in
which
certainly
no
laughter
was
you
have
your
usual
fire
he
said
but
the
wind
has
quite
gone
down
and
i
am
sure
it
is
not
wanted
it
looks
cheerful
always
john
which
is
the
reason
i
suppose
why
you
carefully
place
yourself
out
of
sight
of
it
one
of
the
prejudices
of
english
life
and
then
he
came
forward
into
the
recess
of
the
window
which
was
partly
separated
from
the
room
by
a
table
with
flowers
on
it
and
a
great
bush
in
a
pot
of
delicate
fern
it
was
perhaps
significant
though
he
did
not
mean
it
for
any
demonstration
of
partisanship
that
he
sat
down
on
elinor
side
both
the
ladies
felt
it
so
instinctively
although
on
the
contrary
had
the
truth
been
known
all
john
real
agreement
was
with
the
mother
but
in
such
a
conjuncture
it
is
not
truth
but
personal
sympathy
that
carries
the
day
you
are
almost
in
the
dark
here
he
said
neither
of
us
is
doing
anything
one
is
lazy
on
a
summer
night
there
is
a
great
deal
more
in
it
than
that
said
elinor
in
a
voice
which
faltered
a
little
you
talk
about
summer
nights
and
the
weather
and
all
manner
of
indifferent
things
but
you
know
all
the
time
there
is
but
one
real
subject
to
talk
of
and
that
we
are
all
thinking
of
that
that
is
my
line
aunt
said
john
elinor
is
right
we
might
sit
and
make
conversation
but
of
course
this
is
the
only
subject
we
are
thinking
of
it
very
kind
of
you
to
take
me
into
the
consultation
of
course
i
am
in
a
kind
of
way
the
nearest
in
relation
and
the
only
man
in
the
family
except
my
father
and
i
know
a
little
about
law
and
all
that
now
let
me
hear
formally
as
if
i
knew
nothing
about
it
and
in
fact
i
know
very
little
what
the
question
is
elinor
has
met
someone
who
who
has
proposed
to
her
not
to
put
too
fine
a
point
upon
it
said
john
with
a
smile
that
was
somewhat
ghastly
and
she
has
accepted
him
congratulations
are
understood
but
here
there
arises
a
hitch
there
arises
no
hitch
mamma
is
dissatisfied
which
mamma
generally
is
chiefly
because
she
does
not
know
compton
and
some
wretched
old
woman
who
does
know
him
either
has
written
to
her
to
her
and
also
to
me
telling
us
a
pack
of
lies
said
elinor
indignantly
to
which
i
do
not
give
the
least
credence
for
a
moment
not
for
a
moment
that
all
very
well
for
you
said
john
it
quite
simple
but
for
us
elinor
that
is
for
your
mother
and
me
as
you
are
good
enough
to
allow
me
to
have
a
say
in
the
matter
it
not
so
simple
we
feel
you
know
that
like
cæsar
wife
our
elinor
husband
he
could
not
help
making
a
grimace
as
he
said
that
word
but
no
one
saw
or
suspected
it
should
be
above
suspicion
that
is
exactly
what
i
feel
john
well
we
must
do
something
about
it
do
you
see
probably
it
will
be
as
easy
as
possible
for
him
to
clear
himself
the
phil
good
heavens
to
think
it
was
a
man
branded
with
such
a
name
that
was
to
marry
elinor
for
a
moment
he
was
silenced
by
the
thought
as
if
some
one
had
given
him
a
blow
to
clear
himself
said
elinor
and
do
you
think
i
will
permit
him
to
be
asked
to
clear
himself
do
you
think
i
will
allow
him
to
believe
for
a
moment
that
believed
anything
against
him
do
you
think
i
will
take
the
word
of
a
spiteful
old
woman
old
women
are
not
always
spiteful
and
they
are
sometimes
right
john
put
out
his
hand
to
prevent
dennistoun
from
speaking
which
indeed
she
had
no
intention
of
doing
i
do
mean
so
of
course
in
compton
case
and
i
do
know
what
has
been
said
things
that
are
very
uncomfortable
very
inconsistent
with
a
happy
life
and
a
comfortable
establishment
said
dennistoun
oh
if
you
could
only
hear
yourself
mamma
you
are
not
generally
a
philistine
i
must
say
that
for
you
but
if
you
only
heard
the
tone
in
which
you
said
establishment
the
most
conventional
in
existence
could
not
have
done
it
better
and
as
for
what
has
been
said
there
has
nothing
been
said
but
what
is
said
about
everybody
what
probably
would
be
said
of
you
yourself
john
for
you
play
whist
sometimes
i
hear
and
often
billiards
at
the
club
a
god
forbid
had
come
from
john
lips
when
she
said
what
would
probably
be
said
of
yourself
audible
that
is
to
elinor
not
to
the
mother
she
sprang
up
as
this
murmur
came
to
her
ear
oh
if
you
are
going
to
prejudge
the
case
there
is
nothing
for
me
to
say
i
should
be
very
sorry
to
prejudge
the
case
or
to
judge
it
all
said
john
i
am
too
closely
interested
to
be
judicial
let
somebody
who
knows
nothing
about
it
be
your
judge
let
the
accusations
be
submitted
to
your
rector
say
he
a
sensible
man
enough
and
knows
the
world
he
wo
be
scared
by
a
rubber
at
the
club
or
that
sort
of
thing
let
him
inquire
and
then
your
mind
will
be
at
rest
there
is
only
one
difficulty
john
said
dennistoun
hudson
would
be
the
best
man
in
the
world
only
for
one
thing
that
it
is
from
his
sister
and
his
wife
that
the
warning
came
oh
said
john
this
fact
seemed
to
take
him
aback
in
the
most
ludicrous
way
he
sat
and
gazed
at
them
and
had
not
another
word
to
say
perhaps
the
fact
that
he
himself
who
suggested
the
inquiry
was
still
better
informed
of
the
true
state
of
the
case
and
of
the
truth
of
the
accusation
than
were
those
to
whom
he
might
have
submitted
it
gave
him
a
sense
of
the
hopelessness
and
also
absurdity
of
the
attempt
more
than
anything
else
could
have
done
and
that
proves
if
there
was
nothing
else
said
elinor
how
false
it
is
for
how
could
hudson
and
mary
dale
know
they
are
not
fashionable
people
they
are
not
in
society
how
could
they
or
any
one
like
them
know
anything
of
phil
she
stopped
quickly
drew
herself
up
and
added
of
compton
i
mean
they
might
not
know
but
they
might
state
their
authority
dennistoun
said
and
if
the
rector
can
not
be
used
to
help
us
surely
john
you
are
a
man
of
the
world
you
are
not
like
a
woman
unacquainted
with
evidence
why
should
not
you
do
it
though
you
are
as
you
kindly
say
an
interested
party
he
shall
not
do
it
i
forbid
him
to
do
it
if
he
takes
in
hand
anything
of
the
kind
he
must
say
to
me
you
hear
said
john
but
i
could
not
do
it
in
any
case
my
dear
elinor
i
am
too
near
i
never
could
see
this
thing
all
round
why
not
your
lawyer
old
lynch
a
decent
old
fellow
i
will
tell
him
the
same
cried
elinor
i
will
never
speak
to
him
again
my
dear
said
her
mother
you
will
give
everybody
the
idea
that
you
do
want
to
know
the
truth
i
know
the
truth
already
said
elinor
rising
with
great
dignity
do
you
think
that
any
slander
would
for
a
moment
shake
my
faith
in
you
or
you
you
do
deserve
it
john
for
you
turn
against
me
you
that
i
thought
were
going
to
take
my
part
but
do
you
think
if
all
the
people
in
london
set
up
one
story
that
i
would
believe
it
against
you
and
how
should
i
against
she
added
with
an
emphasis
upon
the
word
as
expressing
something
immeasurably
more
to
be
loved
and
trusted
than
either
mother
or
cousin
by
which
after
having
raised
john
up
to
a
sort
of
heaven
of
gratified
affection
she
let
him
down
again
to
the
ground
like
a
stone
oh
yes
trusted
in
with
perfect
faith
nothing
believed
against
him
whom
she
had
known
all
her
life
but
yet
not
to
be
mentioned
in
the
same
breath
with
the
ineffable
trust
she
reposed
in
the
man
she
loved
whom
she
did
not
know
at
all
the
first
made
john
countenance
beam
with
emotion
and
pleasure
the
second
brought
a
cold
shade
over
his
face
for
a
moment
he
could
scarcely
speak
she
bribes
us
he
said
at
last
forcing
a
smile
she
flatters
us
but
only
to
let
us
drop
again
dennistoun
it
is
as
good
as
saying
are
we
to
they
all
do
so
said
the
elder
lady
calmly
i
am
used
to
it
but
perhaps
i
am
not
quite
used
to
it
said
john
with
something
in
his
voice
which
made
them
both
look
at
him
elinor
only
for
a
moment
carelessly
before
she
swept
away
dennistoun
with
a
more
warmly
awakened
sensation
as
if
she
had
made
some
discovery
ah
she
said
with
a
tone
of
pain
but
elinor
did
not
wait
for
any
further
disclosures
she
waved
her
hand
and
went
off
with
her
head
high
carrying
as
she
felt
the
honours
of
war
they
might
plot
indeed
behind
her
back
and
try
to
invent
some
tribunal
before
which
her
future
husband
might
be
arraigned
but
john
at
least
would
say
nothing
to
make
things
worse
john
would
be
true
to
her
he
would
not
injure
phil
compton
elinor
perhaps
guessed
a
little
of
what
john
was
thinking
and
felt
though
she
could
scarcely
have
told
how
that
it
would
be
a
point
of
honour
with
him
not
to
betray
her
love
he
sat
with
dennistoun
in
partial
silence
for
some
time
after
this
he
felt
as
if
he
had
been
partially
discovered
partially
and
yet
more
would
be
discovered
than
there
was
to
discover
for
if
either
of
them
believed
that
he
was
in
love
with
elinor
they
were
mistaken
he
said
to
himself
he
had
been
annoyed
by
her
engagement
but
he
had
never
come
to
the
point
of
asking
her
that
question
in
his
own
person
no
nor
would
not
he
said
to
himself
certainly
would
not
not
even
to
save
her
from
the
clutches
of
this
gambler
and
adventurer
no
they
might
think
what
they
liked
but
this
was
the
case
he
never
should
have
done
it
never
would
have
exposed
himself
to
refusal
never
besought
this
girl
to
have
the
control
of
his
life
poor
nelly
all
the
same
poor
little
thing
to
think
she
had
so
little
judgment
as
to
ignore
what
might
have
been
a
great
deal
better
and
to
pin
her
faith
to
the
phil
chapter
iv
in
the
morning
john
accompanied
elinor
to
church
dennistoun
had
found
an
excuse
for
not
going
which
i
am
sorry
to
say
was
a
way
she
had
she
expressed
and
felt
much
sorrow
for
it
herself
saying
which
was
quite
true
that
not
to
go
was
a
great
distress
to
her
and
put
the
household
out
and
was
a
custom
she
did
not
approve
of
but
somehow
it
had
grown
upon
her
she
regretted
this
but
did
it
saying
that
everybody
was
illogical
and
that
when
elinor
had
some
one
to
go
with
she
thought
herself
justified
at
her
age
in
this
little
indulgence
neither
elinor
nor
john
objected
to
the
arrangement
there
are
things
that
can
be
said
in
a
walk
while
both
parties
are
in
motion
and
when
it
is
not
necessary
to
face
each
other
and
to
be
subjected
each
to
the
other
examination
of
feature
and
expression
it
is
easier
in
this
way
to
say
many
things
to
ask
questions
which
might
be
embarrassing
to
receive
the
fire
of
an
examination
which
it
might
be
otherwise
difficult
to
meet
thus
the
two
had
not
walked
above
half
the
way
to
church
which
was
on
the
other
edge
of
the
combe
and
stood
a
lovely
old
place
but
not
the
trim
and
restored
and
edifice
it
is
nowadays
tinkling
its
little
bells
into
the
sweet
moorland
air
amid
such
a
hum
of
innumerable
bees
as
seemed
to
make
the
very
sunshine
a
vehicle
for
sound
before
john
began
to
perceive
that
he
was
being
ingeniously
driven
to
revelations
which
he
had
never
intended
by
a
process
for
which
he
was
not
at
all
prepared
she
who
had
been
so
indignant
last
night
and
determined
not
to
allow
a
word
to
be
said
against
the
immaculate
honour
of
the
man
she
loved
was
now
was
it
possible
straining
all
her
faculties
to
obtain
from
him
whom
she
would
not
permit
to
be
phil
compton
judge
such
unguarded
admissions
as
would
enlighten
her
as
to
what
phil
compton
was
accused
of
it
was
some
time
before
john
perceived
her
aim
he
did
not
even
grasp
the
idea
at
first
that
this
girl
whose
whole
heart
was
set
upon
marrying
phil
compton
and
defying
for
his
sake
every
prophecy
of
evil
and
all
the
teachings
of
prudence
did
not
indeed
at
all
know
what
it
was
which
phil
had
been
supposed
to
have
done
had
she
been
a
girl
in
society
she
could
scarcely
have
avoided
some
glimmerings
of
knowledge
she
would
have
heard
an
unguarded
word
here
and
there
a
broken
phrase
an
expression
of
scorn
or
dislike
she
might
even
have
heard
that
most
unforgettable
of
nicknames
the
phil
but
elinor
who
was
not
in
society
heard
none
of
these
things
she
had
been
warned
in
the
first
fervour
of
her
betrothal
that
he
was
not
a
man
she
ought
to
marry
but
why
nobody
had
told
her
how
was
she
to
know
you
do
like
lady
mariamne
john
it
matters
very
little
whether
i
like
her
or
not
we
do
meet
once
in
a
year
it
will
matter
if
you
are
to
be
in
a
kind
of
way
connected
what
has
she
ever
done
that
you
should
like
her
she
is
very
nice
at
home
she
has
three
nice
little
children
it
quite
pretty
to
see
her
with
them
ah
i
daresay
it
pretty
to
see
a
tiger
with
her
cubs
i
doubt
what
do
you
mean
john
what
has
she
ever
done
i
can
not
tell
you
elinor
nothing
perhaps
she
does
not
take
my
fancy
that
all
that
not
all
you
could
never
be
so
unjust
and
so
absurd
how
dreadful
you
good
people
are
pretending
to
mean
kindness
she
cried
you
put
the
mark
of
your
dislike
upon
people
and
then
you
wo
say
why
what
have
done
it
was
this
they
that
put
john
upon
his
guard
hitherto
she
had
only
been
asking
about
the
sister
who
did
not
matter
so
very
much
if
a
man
was
to
be
judged
by
his
sister
but
they
gave
him
a
new
light
ca
you
understand
elinor
he
said
that
without
doing
anything
that
can
be
built
upon
a
woman
may
set
herself
in
a
position
of
enmity
to
the
world
her
hand
against
every
one
and
every
one
hand
against
her
i
know
that
well
enough
generally
because
she
does
not
comply
with
every
conventional
rule
but
does
and
thinks
what
commends
itself
to
her
i
do
that
myself
so
far
as
i
can
with
mamma
behind
me
you
the
question
has
nothing
to
do
with
you
why
not
with
me
as
much
as
with
another
of
my
family
said
elinor
throwing
back
her
head
he
turned
round
upon
her
with
something
like
a
snort
of
indignation
she
to
be
compared
but
elinor
met
his
eyes
with
scornful
composure
and
defiance
and
john
was
obliged
to
calm
himself
there
no
analogy
he
said
lady
mariamne
is
an
old
campaigner
she
up
to
everything
besides
a
if
it
comes
to
that
is
not
a
very
near
relation
no
one
will
judge
you
by
her
he
would
not
be
led
into
any
discussion
of
the
other
whose
name
alas
elinor
intended
to
bear
if
it
comes
to
that
perhaps
you
think
said
elinor
with
a
smile
of
fine
scorn
that
you
will
prevent
it
ever
coming
to
that
oh
no
he
said
i
very
humble
i
do
think
much
of
my
own
powers
in
that
way
nothing
that
i
can
do
will
affect
it
if
providence
take
it
in
hand
you
really
think
it
a
big
enough
thing
to
invoke
providence
about
if
providence
looks
after
the
sparrows
as
we
are
told
said
john
it
certainly
may
be
expected
to
step
in
to
save
a
nice
girl
like
you
nelly
from
from
connections
you
soon
get
to
hate
and
and
a
shady
man
she
turned
upon
him
with
sparkling
eyes
in
a
sudden
blaze
of
indignation
how
dare
you
how
dare
you
i
dare
a
great
deal
more
than
that
to
save
you
you
must
hear
me
nelly
they
all
badly
spoken
of
not
one
but
all
they
are
a
shady
lot
excuse
a
man
way
of
talking
i
do
know
what
other
words
to
use
partly
from
misfortune
but
more
from
nelly
nelly
how
could
you
a
girl
like
you
tolerate
that
she
turned
upon
him
again
breathing
hard
with
restrained
rage
and
desperation
evidently
she
was
at
a
loss
for
words
to
convey
her
indignant
wrath
and
at
last
in
sheer
inability
to
express
the
vehemence
of
her
feelings
she
fastened
on
one
word
and
repeated
in
accents
of
scorn
yes
said
john
my
aunt
and
you
may
not
always
understand
each
other
but
she
proved
her
case
to
every
fair
mind
by
yourself
elinor
a
girl
could
not
be
better
brought
up
than
you
been
and
you
could
not
put
up
with
it
not
unless
you
changed
your
nature
as
well
as
your
name
with
what
she
said
with
what
they
had
gone
up
and
down
the
sloping
sides
of
the
combe
through
the
rustling
copse
sometimes
where
there
was
a
path
sometimes
where
there
was
none
treading
over
the
big
bushes
of
ling
and
the
all
bursting
into
bloom
past
groups
of
primeval
firs
and
seedling
beeches
over
little
hillocks
and
hollows
formed
of
rocks
or
big
old
roots
of
trees
covered
with
the
close
glittering
green
foliage
and
dark
blue
clusters
of
the
dewberry
with
the
hum
of
bees
filling
the
air
the
twittering
of
the
birds
the
sound
of
the
church
bells
nothing
more
like
the
heart
of
summer
more
peaceful
genial
happy
than
that
brooding
calm
of
nature
amid
all
the
harmonious
sounds
could
be
but
as
elinor
put
this
impatient
question
her
countenance
all
ablaze
with
anger
and
vehemence
and
resolution
yet
with
a
gleam
of
anxiety
in
the
puckers
of
her
forehead
and
the
eyes
which
shone
from
beneath
them
they
stepped
out
upon
the
road
by
which
other
groups
were
passing
all
bound
towards
the
centre
of
the
church
and
its
tinkling
bells
elinor
stopped
and
drew
a
longer
panting
breath
and
gave
him
a
look
of
fierce
reproach
as
if
this
too
were
his
fault
and
then
she
smoothed
her
ruffled
plumes
after
the
manner
of
women
and
replied
to
the
salutations
with
the
smiles
and
nods
of
use
and
wont
she
knew
everybody
both
the
rich
and
the
poor
or
rather
i
should
say
the
and
the
for
there
were
neither
rich
nor
poor
formally
speaking
on
windyhill
john
did
not
find
it
so
easy
to
put
his
emotions
in
his
pocket
he
cast
an
admiring
glance
upon
her
as
with
heightened
colour
and
a
little
panting
of
the
breath
but
no
other
sign
of
disturbance
she
made
her
inquiries
after
this
one
mother
and
that
one
child
it
was
wonderful
to
him
to
see
how
the
storm
was
got
under
in
a
moment
an
occasional
glance
aside
at
himself
from
the
corner
of
her
eye
a
sort
of
dart
of
defiance
as
if
to
bid
him
remember
that
she
was
not
done
with
him
was
shot
at
john
from
time
to
time
over
the
heads
of
the
innocent
country
people
in
whom
she
pretended
to
be
so
much
interested
pretended
was
it
pretence
or
was
the
one
as
real
as
the
other
he
heard
her
promising
to
come
to
see
an
invalid
to
send
certain
articles
as
soon
as
she
got
home
to
look
up
certain
books
would
she
do
so
or
was
all
this
a
mere
veil
to
cover
the
other
which
engaged
all
her
soul
and
then
there
came
the
service
that
soothing
routine
of
familiar
prayers
which
the
lips
of
men
and
women
absorbed
in
the
violence
and
urgency
of
life
murmur
over
almost
without
knowing
with
now
and
then
an
awakening
to
something
that
touches
their
own
aspirations
to
something
that
offers
or
that
asks
for
help
because
there
is
none
other
that
fighteth
for
us
but
only
thou
o
god
that
seems
to
the
careless
soul
such
a
as
if
peace
was
asked
for
only
because
there
was
none
other
to
fight
but
to
the
man
heavily
laden
what
a
cry
out
of
the
depths
because
there
is
none
other
all
resources
gone
all
possibilities
but
one
that
fighteth
for
us
standing
fast
always
the
champion
of
the
perplexed
the
overborne
the
weak
john
was
a
little
careless
in
this
respect
as
so
many
young
men
are
he
thought
most
of
the
music
when
he
joined
the
fashionable
throng
in
the
temple
church
but
there
was
no
music
to
speak
of
at
windyhill
there
was
more
sound
of
the
bees
outside
and
the
birds
and
the
sighing
bass
of
the
than
of
anything
more
carefully
concerted
the
organ
was
played
with
a
curious
drone
in
it
almost
like
that
of
the
primitive
bagpipe
but
there
was
that
one
phrase
a
strong
strain
of
human
appeal
enough
to
lift
the
world
nay
to
let
itself
go
straight
to
the
blue
heavens
because
there
is
none
other
that
fighteth
for
us
but
only
thou
o
god
hudson
preached
his
little
sermon
like
a
discord
in
the
midst
what
should
he
have
preached
it
for
that
little
sermon
which
was
only
composed
because
he
could
not
help
himself
which
was
about
nothing
in
heaven
or
earth
john
gave
it
a
sort
of
partial
attention
because
he
could
not
help
it
partly
in
wonder
to
think
how
a
sensible
man
like
hudson
could
account
to
himself
for
such
strange
little
interruption
of
the
natural
sequence
of
high
human
emotion
what
theory
had
he
in
his
mind
this
was
a
question
john
was
fond
of
putting
to
himself
with
perhaps
an
idea
peculiar
to
a
lawyer
that
every
man
must
be
thinking
what
he
is
about
and
be
able
to
produce
a
clear
reason
and
as
it
were
some
theory
of
the
meaning
of
his
own
actions
which
everybody
must
know
is
nonsense
for
the
rector
of
course
preached
just
because
it
was
in
his
day
work
and
the
people
would
have
been
much
surprised
though
possibly
much
relieved
had
he
not
done
so
feeling
that
to
listen
was
in
the
day
work
too
and
to
be
gone
through
doggedly
as
a
duty
john
thought
how
much
better
it
would
be
to
have
some
man
who
could
preach
now
and
then
when
he
had
something
to
say
instead
of
troubling
the
rector
who
good
man
had
nothing
but
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
he
was
thinking
this
consecutively
while
the
morning
went
on
it
flitted
through
his
mind
from
time
to
time
among
his
many
thinkings
about
the
compton
family
and
elinor
poor
nelly
standing
upon
the
edge
of
that
precipice
and
the
helplessness
of
every
one
to
save
her
and
the
great
refrain
like
the
peal
of
an
organ
going
through
everything
none
other
that
fighteth
for
us
but
only
thou
o
god
surely
surely
to
prevent
this
sacrifice
he
would
interfere
she
turned
to
him
the
moment
they
were
out
of
the
church
doors
with
that
same
look
of
eager
defiance
yet
demand
and
as
soon
as
they
left
the
road
the
first
step
into
the
copse
putting
out
her
hand
to
call
his
attention
you
said
i
could
not
put
up
with
it
a
girl
so
as
i
am
what
is
it
a
girl
ca
put
up
with
a
disorderly
house
late
hours
and
so
forth
hateful
to
the
what
is
it
what
is
it
john
have
you
been
thinking
of
that
all
through
the
morning
prayers
he
said
yes
i
have
been
thinking
about
it
what
did
you
expect
me
to
think
about
is
there
anything
else
so
important
hudson
sermon
perhaps
which
i
have
heard
before
which
i
suppose
listened
to
she
said
with
a
troubled
laugh
i
did
a
little
wondering
how
a
good
man
like
that
could
go
on
doing
it
and
there
were
other
things
john
did
not
like
to
say
what
it
was
which
was
still
throbbing
through
the
air
to
him
and
through
his
own
being
nothing
that
is
of
so
much
moment
to
me
come
back
john
to
the
girl
you
think
that
a
poor
sort
of
description
elinor
so
it
is
you
are
of
course
a
great
deal
more
than
that
still
it
what
one
can
turn
to
most
easily
you
do
know
what
life
is
in
a
sort
of
fast
house
where
there
is
nothing
thought
of
but
amusement
or
where
it
a
constant
round
of
race
meetings
yachting
steeplechases
i
do
know
if
men
still
ride
steeplechases
i
mean
that
sort
of
thing
monte
carlo
in
the
winter
betting
all
the
year
round
if
not
on
one
thing
then
on
another
expedients
to
raise
money
for
money
always
wanted
you
know
how
can
you
know
what
goes
on
in
a
fast
life
do
you
see
john
she
cried
eagerly
that
all
that
if
put
in
a
different
way
not
to
their
prejudice
if
put
in
the
right
way
would
sound
delightful
there
is
no
harm
in
these
things
at
all
betting
not
a
sin
in
the
bible
any
more
than
races
are
do
you
see
it
only
the
abuse
of
them
that
wrong
one
might
ruin
one
health
i
believe
with
tea
which
is
the
most
righteous
thing
i
should
like
above
all
things
a
yacht
say
in
the
mediterranean
and
to
go
to
monte
carlo
which
is
a
beautiful
place
and
where
there
is
the
best
music
in
the
world
besides
the
gambling
i
should
like
even
to
see
the
gambling
once
in
a
way
for
the
fun
of
the
thing
you
do
frighten
me
at
all
i
have
been
a
fortnight
at
lady
mariamne
and
the
continual
was
delightful
there
was
never
a
dull
moment
as
for
expedients
to
raise
money
to
be
sure
old
prestwich
is
as
rich
as
croesus
or
was
said
john
with
significance
but
you
are
not
going
to
live
with
lady
mariamne
i
suppose
oh
john
she
cried
oh
john
suddenly
seizing
him
by
the
arm
clasping
her
hands
on
it
in
the
pretty
way
of
earnestness
she
had
though
one
hand
held
her
parasol
which
was
inconvenient
the
soft
face
was
suffused
with
rosy
colour
so
different
from
the
angry
red
the
flush
of
love
and
tenderness
her
eyes
swam
in
liquid
light
looking
up
with
mingled
happiness
and
entreaty
to
john
face
fancy
what
he
says
that
he
will
not
object
to
come
here
for
half
the
year
to
let
me
be
with
my
mother
remember
what
he
is
a
man
of
fashion
and
fond
of
the
world
and
of
going
out
and
all
that
he
has
consented
to
come
nay
he
almost
offered
to
come
for
six
months
in
the
year
to
be
with
mamma
good
heavens
cried
john
to
himself
he
must
indeed
be
down
on
his
luck
but
what
he
said
was
does
your
mother
know
of
this
elinor
i
have
not
told
her
yet
i
have
reserved
it
to
hear
first
what
you
had
to
say
and
so
far
as
i
can
make
out
you
have
nothing
at
all
to
say
only
general
things
disapproval
in
the
general
what
should
you
say
if
i
told
you
that
he
disapproves
too
he
said
himself
that
there
had
been
too
much
of
all
that
that
he
had
backed
something
is
that
what
you
say
backed
it
at
odds
and
stood
to
win
what
he
calls
a
pot
of
money
but
after
that
was
decided
for
he
said
he
could
not
be
off
bets
that
were
made
never
any
more
now
that
i
know
you
have
nothing
more
to
say
my
heart
is
free
and
i
can
tell
you
he
has
never
really
liked
that
sort
of
life
but
was
led
into
it
when
he
was
very
young
and
now
as
soon
as
we
are
together
you
know
she
looked
so
bright
so
sweet
in
the
happiness
of
her
love
that
john
could
have
flung
her
from
his
arms
and
felt
that
she
insulted
him
by
that
clinging
hold
he
means
to
turn
entirely
to
serious
things
and
to
go
into
politics
john
oh
he
is
going
into
politics
of
course
on
the
people
side
to
do
everything
for
them
home
rule
and
all
that
is
best
to
see
that
they
are
heard
in
parliament
and
have
their
wants
attended
to
instead
of
jobs
and
corruption
everywhere
so
you
will
see
john
that
if
he
has
been
fast
and
gone
a
little
too
far
and
been
very
much
mixed
up
in
the
turf
and
all
that
it
was
only
in
the
exuberance
of
youth
liking
the
fun
of
it
as
i
feel
i
should
myself
but
that
now
now
all
that
is
to
be
changed
when
he
steps
into
settled
responsible
life
i
should
not
have
told
you
if
you
had
repeated
the
lies
that
people
say
but
as
you
did
not
but
only
found
fault
with
him
for
being
fast
then
you
have
heard
what
people
say
he
shifted
his
arm
a
little
so
that
she
instinctively
perceived
that
the
affectionate
clasp
of
her
hands
was
no
longer
agreeable
to
him
and
his
face
seemed
suddenly
to
have
become
a
blank
page
absolutely
devoid
of
all
expression
he
kicked
vigorously
at
one
of
the
hillocks
he
had
stumbled
against
as
if
he
thought
he
could
dislodge
it
and
get
it
out
of
his
way
mariamne
told
me
there
was
a
lot
of
lies
that
people
said
i
am
so
glad
john
oh
so
thankful
that
you
have
not
repeated
any
of
them
for
now
i
can
feel
you
are
my
own
good
john
as
you
always
were
not
a
slanderer
of
any
one
and
we
can
go
on
being
fond
of
each
other
like
brother
and
sister
i
have
told
him
you
have
been
the
best
of
brothers
to
me
oh
said
john
without
a
sign
of
wonder
or
admiration
in
him
with
a
dead
blank
in
his
face
and
what
do
you
think
he
said
i
know
he
must
be
a
capital
fellow
ne
not
nelly
said
poor
john
with
a
foolish
pang
that
seemed
to
rend
his
heart
oh
if
that
scamp
that
cheat
that
low
betting
rascal
were
but
here
he
would
him
to
take
not
herself
only
but
the
dear
pet
name
that
she
had
said
was
only
john
he
says
nell
sometimes
john
oh
not
nelly
nelly
is
for
you
only
i
would
never
let
him
call
me
that
but
they
are
all
for
short
names
one
syllable
he
is
phil
and
mariamne
well
at
home
they
call
her
jew
horrible
is
it
because
she
was
called
after
some
jewess
but
somehow
it
seems
queer
when
you
see
her
so
fair
and
frizzy
like
anything
but
a
jew
so
i
have
got
one
letter
to
myself
said
john
i
do
know
that
i
think
that
worth
very
much
however
and
so
far
as
i
can
see
you
seem
to
think
everything
very
fine
the
bets
perhaps
and
the
rows
and
all
well
they
are
you
know
said
elinor
with
a
laugh
to
a
little
country
mouse
like
me
that
has
never
seen
anything
there
is
always
something
going
on
and
their
slang
way
of
speaking
is
certainly
very
amusing
if
it
is
not
at
all
dignified
and
they
have
such
droll
ways
of
looking
at
things
all
so
entirely
different
do
you
know
john
sometimes
in
one
life
one
longs
for
something
to
be
quite
different
a
complete
change
anything
new
if
that
is
what
you
long
for
no
doubt
you
will
get
it
elinor
well
she
cried
i
have
had
the
other
for
years
long
enough
to
have
exhausted
it
do
you
think
but
i
do
mean
to
throw
it
over
oh
no
coming
back
to
mamma
makes
the
arrangement
perfect
probably
in
the
end
it
is
the
old
life
the
life
i
was
brought
up
in
that
i
shall
like
best
in
the
long
run
that
is
one
thing
of
being
well
brought
up
phil
will
laugh
till
he
cries
when
i
tell
him
of
your
description
of
me
as
a
girl
john
set
his
teeth
as
he
walked
or
rather
stumbled
along
by
her
side
catching
in
the
roots
of
the
trees
as
he
had
never
done
before
and
swearing
under
his
breath
her
flutter
of
talk
running
on
delighted
full
of
laughter
and
softness
as
if
he
had
fully
declared
his
satisfaction
and
was
interested
in
every
detail
kept
john
in
a
state
of
suppressed
fury
which
made
his
countenance
dark
and
almost
took
the
sight
from
his
eyes
he
did
not
know
how
to
escape
from
that
false
position
nor
did
she
give
him
time
she
had
so
much
to
say
dennistoun
looked
anxiously
at
the
pair
as
they
came
up
through
the
copse
to
the
level
of
the
cottage
there
were
no
enclosures
in
that
primitive
place
from
the
copse
you
came
straight
into
the
garden
with
its
banks
of
flowers
she
was
seated
near
the
cottage
door
in
a
corner
sheltered
from
the
sun
with
a
number
of
books
about
her
but
i
think
she
had
read
anything
except
some
portions
of
the
lessons
in
the
morning
service
she
had
been
sitting
with
her
eyes
vaguely
fixed
upon
the
horizon
and
her
hands
clasped
in
her
lap
and
a
heavy
shadow
like
an
overhanging
cloud
upon
her
mind
but
when
she
heard
elinor
voice
approaching
so
gay
and
tuneful
her
heart
rose
a
little
john
evidently
could
have
had
nothing
very
bad
to
say
elinor
had
been
satisfied
with
the
morning
dennistoun
had
expected
to
see
them
come
back
estranged
and
silent
the
conclusion
she
drew
was
entirely
satisfactory
after
all
john
must
have
been
moved
solely
by
general
disapproval
which
is
so
very
different
from
the
dreadful
hints
and
warnings
that
might
mean
any
criminality
elinor
was
talking
to
him
as
freely
as
she
had
done
before
this
spectre
rose
it
must
dennistoun
concluded
be
all
right
it
was
not
till
he
was
going
away
that
she
had
an
opportunity
of
talking
with
him
alone
her
satisfaction
it
must
be
allowed
had
been
a
little
subdued
by
john
demeanour
during
the
afternoon
and
evening
but
dennistoun
had
said
to
herself
that
there
might
be
other
ways
of
accounting
for
this
she
had
long
had
a
fancy
that
john
was
more
interested
in
elinor
than
he
had
confessed
himself
to
be
it
had
been
her
conviction
that
as
soon
as
he
felt
it
warrantable
as
soon
as
he
was
sufficiently
and
his
practice
secured
he
would
probably
declare
himself
with
she
feared
no
particular
issue
so
far
as
elinor
was
concerned
and
perhaps
he
was
disappointed
poor
fellow
which
was
a
very
natural
explanation
of
his
glum
looks
but
at
breakfast
on
monday
elinor
announced
her
intention
of
driving
her
cousin
to
the
station
and
went
out
to
see
that
the
pony
was
harnessed
an
operation
which
took
some
time
for
the
pony
was
out
in
the
field
and
had
to
be
caught
and
the
man
of
all
work
who
had
a
hundred
affairs
to
look
after
had
to
be
caught
too
to
perform
this
duty
which
sometimes
however
elinor
performed
herself
but
always
with
some
expenditure
of
time
dennistoun
seized
the
opportunity
plunging
at
once
into
the
subject
you
seemed
to
get
on
all
right
together
yesterday
john
so
i
suppose
you
found
that
after
all
there
was
not
very
much
to
say
i
was
not
allowed
to
say
anything
you
mean
oh
john
john
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
after
all
aunt
ellen
he
said
stop
it
if
you
can
if
there
is
any
means
in
the
world
by
which
you
can
stop
it
do
so
i
ca
bring
accusations
against
the
man
for
i
could
prove
them
i
only
know
what
everybody
knows
he
is
not
a
man
fit
for
elinor
to
marry
he
is
not
fit
to
touch
the
tie
of
her
shoe
oh
do
trouble
me
with
your
superlatives
john
elinor
is
a
good
girl
and
a
clever
girl
but
not
a
lady
of
romance
is
there
anything
really
against
him
tell
me
for
goodness
sake
even
with
these
few
words
you
have
made
me
very
unhappy
dennistoun
said
in
a
half
resentful
tone
i
ca
help
it
said
the
unfortunate
man
i
ca
bring
accusations
as
i
tell
you
he
is
simply
a
scamp
that
is
all
i
know
a
scamp
said
dennistoun
with
a
look
of
alarm
but
then
that
is
a
word
that
has
so
many
meanings
a
scamp
may
be
only
a
careless
fellow
nice
in
his
way
that
is
not
enough
to
break
off
a
marriage
for
and
john
as
you
have
said
so
much
you
must
say
more
i
have
no
more
to
say
that
all
i
know
inquire
what
the
hudsons
have
heard
stop
it
if
you
can
oh
dear
dear
here
is
elinor
back
already
dennistoun
said
chapter
the
next
time
that
john
presence
was
required
at
the
cottage
was
for
the
signing
of
the
very
simple
settlements
which
as
there
was
nothing
or
next
to
nothing
in
the
power
of
the
man
to
settle
upon
his
wife
were
easy
enough
he
met
lynch
who
was
dennistoun
man
of
business
and
a
sharp
london
solicitor
who
was
for
the
husband
elinor
fortune
was
five
thousand
pounds
no
more
not
counting
her
expectations
from
him
which
were
left
out
of
the
question
it
was
a
very
small
matter
altogether
and
one
which
the
smart
solicitor
who
was
in
compton
interest
spoke
of
with
a
certain
contempt
as
who
should
say
he
was
not
in
the
habit
of
being
disturbed
and
brought
to
the
country
for
any
such
trifle
it
was
now
august
not
a
time
when
any
man
was
supposed
to
be
available
for
matters
like
these
lynch
was
just
about
starting
for
his
annual
holiday
but
came
at
no
small
personal
inconvenience
to
do
his
duty
by
the
poor
girl
whom
he
had
known
all
his
life
john
and
he
travelled
to
the
cottage
together
and
their
aspect
was
not
cheerful
did
you
ever
hear
said
lynch
such
a
piece
of
folly
as
this
a
man
with
no
character
at
all
this
is
what
it
is
to
leave
a
girl
in
the
sole
care
of
her
mother
what
does
a
woman
know
about
such
things
i
do
think
it
was
her
mother
fault
said
john
anxious
to
do
justice
all
round
elinor
is
very
and
when
she
has
made
up
her
mind
to
a
thing
a
bit
of
a
girl
said
lynch
contemptuously
he
was
an
old
bachelor
and
knew
nothing
about
the
subject
as
the
reader
will
perceive
her
mother
ought
never
to
have
permitted
it
for
a
moment
she
should
have
put
down
her
foot
and
then
miss
elinor
would
soon
have
come
to
reason
what
i
wonder
is
the
ruffian
own
motives
for
it
ca
be
a
little
bit
of
money
like
that
five
thousand
a
mere
mouthful
to
such
a
man
as
he
is
he
get
rid
of
it
all
in
a
week
it
must
be
tied
up
as
tight
as
possible
said
john
here
lynch
faltered
a
little
she
has
got
an
idea
into
her
head
with
the
intention
i
do
doubt
of
defrauding
herself
if
she
can
he
has
got
some
investment
for
it
it
appears
he
is
on
the
board
of
some
company
a
pretty
board
to
take
in
such
a
fellow
but
the
honourable
is
always
something
i
suppose
john
did
not
say
the
though
it
trembled
on
the
edge
of
his
tongue
but
you
will
not
permit
that
he
said
no
no
we
will
not
permit
it
said
lynch
with
an
emphasis
on
the
negative
which
sounded
like
failing
resolution
that
would
be
giving
the
lamb
to
the
wolf
with
a
vengeance
exactly
what
i
said
exactly
what
i
said
i
am
very
glad
tatham
that
you
take
the
same
view
there
is
but
one
view
to
be
taken
said
john
he
must
not
have
the
slightest
power
over
her
money
it
must
be
tied
up
as
tight
as
the
law
can
do
it
not
that
i
think
it
of
the
least
consequence
he
added
of
course
he
will
get
it
all
from
her
one
way
or
another
law
but
a
poor
barrier
against
a
determined
man
i
glad
you
see
that
too
said
lynch
and
you
might
say
a
determined
woman
for
she
has
set
her
mind
on
this
and
we
have
a
nice
business
with
her
i
can
see
a
bit
of
a
girl
said
john
with
a
laugh
echoing
the
previous
sentiment
that
very
true
said
the
old
lawyer
and
still
i
think
her
mother
but
i
do
put
any
great
confidence
in
my
own
power
to
resist
elinor
poor
little
thing
i
known
her
since
she
was
high
indeed
i
may
say
i
knew
her
before
she
was
born
and
you
are
a
relation
mr
tatham
third
or
fourth
cousin
but
still
more
intimate
than
a
person
unconnected
with
them
and
able
to
speak
your
mind
more
freely
i
wonder
now
that
you
never
said
anything
but
in
family
matters
sometimes
one
is
very
reluctant
to
interfere
i
said
everything
i
could
say
not
to
offend
them
mortally
but
i
could
only
tell
them
the
common
talk
of
society
i
told
my
aunt
he
was
a
scamp
but
after
the
first
shock
i
am
not
sure
that
she
thought
that
was
any
such
bad
thing
it
depended
upon
the
sense
you
put
upon
the
word
she
said
oh
women
women
said
lynch
that
their
way
a
reformed
rake
makes
the
best
husband
it
an
sentiment
but
it
in
the
background
of
their
minds
a
sort
of
tradition
that
they
ca
shake
off
or
else
the
poor
fellow
has
had
so
many
disadvantages
and
they
think
they
can
make
it
all
right
it
partly
ignorance
and
partly
vanity
but
they
are
all
the
same
and
their
ways
in
the
matter
of
marriage
are
not
to
be
made
out
you
have
a
great
deal
of
experience
experience
oh
do
speak
of
it
said
the
old
gentleman
a
man
has
a
certain
idea
of
the
value
of
money
however
great
a
fool
he
may
be
but
the
women
and
yet
they
are
said
to
stick
to
money
and
to
be
respectful
of
it
beyond
anything
but
a
miser
i
have
myself
remarked
in
small
matters
said
lynch
in
detail
sixpences
to
railway
porters
and
that
sort
of
thing
so
people
say
at
least
but
a
sum
of
money
on
paper
has
no
effect
on
a
woman
she
will
sign
it
away
with
a
wave
of
her
hand
it
does
touch
their
imagination
five
pounds
in
her
pocket
is
far
more
than
five
thousand
on
paper
to
elinor
for
instance
i
wish
cried
the
old
gentleman
with
a
little
spitefulness
that
this
married
women
property
bill
would
push
on
and
get
itself
made
law
it
would
save
us
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
perhaps
convince
the
world
at
the
last
how
little
able
they
are
to
be
trusted
with
property
a
nice
mess
they
will
make
of
it
and
plenty
of
employment
for
young
solicitors
he
said
rubbing
his
hands
for
this
was
before
that
important
bill
was
passed
which
has
not
had
like
so
many
other
bills
the
disastrous
consequences
which
lynch
foresaw
they
were
met
at
the
station
by
the
pony
carriage
and
at
the
door
by
elinor
herself
who
came
flying
out
to
meet
them
she
seized
lynch
by
both
arms
for
he
was
a
little
old
man
and
she
was
bigger
than
he
was
now
you
will
remember
what
i
said
she
cried
in
his
ear
yet
not
so
low
but
that
john
heard
it
too
you
are
a
little
witch
you
must
insist
upon
anything
so
foolish
leave
all
that
to
me
my
dear
said
lynch
what
do
you
know
about
business
you
must
leave
it
to
me
and
the
other
gentleman
who
i
suppose
is
here
or
coming
he
is
here
but
i
do
care
for
him
i
care
only
for
you
there
are
such
advantages
and
i
do
know
a
great
deal
about
business
and
she
said
with
her
mouth
close
to
the
old
lawyer
ear
it
will
please
phil
so
much
if
i
show
my
confidence
in
him
and
in
the
things
with
which
he
has
to
do
it
will
not
please
him
so
much
if
the
thing
bursts
and
you
are
left
without
a
penny
my
dear
elinor
laughed
i
do
suppose
he
will
mind
a
bit
he
cares
nothing
for
money
but
i
do
she
said
you
know
you
always
say
women
love
acquisition
i
want
good
interest
and
of
course
with
phil
on
it
it
must
be
safe
for
me
oh
that
makes
it
like
the
bank
of
england
you
think
but
i
share
your
confidence
my
pretty
elinor
i
an
old
fellow
no
phil
in
the
world
has
any
charm
for
me
you
must
trust
me
to
do
what
i
feel
is
best
for
you
and
tatham
here
is
quite
of
my
opinion
oh
john
he
is
sure
to
be
against
me
said
elinor
with
an
angry
glimmer
in
her
eyes
she
had
not
as
yet
taken
any
notice
of
him
while
she
welcomed
with
such
warmth
his
old
companion
and
john
had
stood
by
offering
no
greeting
with
his
bag
in
his
hand
but
when
she
said
this
the
quick
feeling
girl
was
seized
with
compunction
she
turned
from
lynch
and
held
out
both
her
hands
to
her
cousin
john
i
did
mean
that
it
is
only
that
i
am
excited
and
cross
and
do
oh
do
go
against
me
she
cried
i
never
did
and
never
will
elinor
he
said
gravely
then
he
asked
after
a
moment
is
compton
here
no
how
could
he
be
here
three
gentlemen
in
the
cottage
is
enough
to
overwhelm
us
already
sharp
fortunately
ca
stay
she
added
lowering
her
voice
he
has
to
be
driven
back
to
the
station
to
catch
the
last
express
and
it
is
august
she
said
with
a
laugh
you
forget
the
now
could
phil
be
anywhere
but
where
there
is
grouse
you
shall
have
some
to
dinner
that
fell
by
his
gun
that
should
mollify
you
for
i
am
sure
you
never
got
grouse
at
the
cottage
before
in
august
mamma
would
as
soon
think
of
buying
manna
for
you
to
eat
i
think
it
would
have
been
more
respectful
elinor
if
he
had
been
here
what
is
grouse
to
you
then
i
do
think
anything
of
the
kind
cried
elinor
he
is
much
better
away
and
i
assure
you
john
i
never
mean
to
put
myself
in
competition
with
the
grouse
the
old
lawyer
had
gone
into
the
where
dennistoun
was
holding
parley
with
sharp
elinor
and
john
were
standing
alone
in
the
half
light
of
the
summer
evening
the
sun
down
the
depths
of
the
combe
below
falling
into
faint
mist
but
the
clouds
still
floating
like
a
vapour
made
of
roses
upon
the
clearness
of
the
blue
above
come
and
take
a
turn
through
the
copse
said
john
they
want
either
of
us
indoors
she
went
with
a
momentary
reluctance
and
a
glance
back
at
the
of
the
from
which
the
sound
of
voices
issued
do
you
think
i
should
be
there
to
keep
them
up
to
the
mark
she
said
half
laughing
and
then
well
yes
as
you
are
going
to
switzerland
too
i
think
you
might
have
stayed
and
seen
me
married
after
all
and
made
acquaintance
with
phil
i
thought
i
should
have
met
him
here
elinor
now
how
could
you
you
know
the
accommodation
of
the
cottage
just
as
well
as
i
do
we
have
two
spare
rooms
and
no
more
you
could
have
sent
me
out
somewhere
to
sleep
that
has
been
done
before
now
oh
john
how
persistent
you
are
and
worrying
when
i
tell
you
that
phil
is
shooting
as
everybody
of
his
kind
is
do
you
think
i
want
him
to
give
up
all
the
habits
of
his
life
he
is
not
like
us
we
adapt
ourselves
but
these
people
parcel
out
their
time
as
if
they
were
in
a
trade
do
you
know
so
long
in
london
so
long
abroad
and
in
the
highlands
for
the
grouse
and
somewhere
else
for
the
partridges
or
they
would
die
i
think
he
might
have
departed
from
that
routine
once
in
a
way
elinor
for
you
i
tell
you
again
john
i
shall
never
put
myself
in
competition
elinor
stopped
abruptly
with
perhaps
he
thought
a
little
glimmer
of
indignation
in
her
eyes
i
hate
women
who
do
that
sort
of
thing
she
cried
up
your
cigar
or
me
as
i
heard
girls
say
such
an
unworthy
thing
when
one
accepts
a
man
one
accepts
him
as
he
stands
with
all
his
habits
what
should
i
think
of
him
if
he
said
up
your
tea
or
me
i
should
laugh
in
his
face
and
throw
him
overboard
without
a
pause
you
would
never
look
at
tea
again
as
long
as
you
lived
if
he
did
not
like
it
i
suppose
that
is
what
you
mean
elinor
perhaps
if
i
found
that
out
afterwards
but
to
be
given
the
choice
beforehand
never
after
all
you
do
half
know
me
john
perhaps
not
he
said
gravely
they
had
left
the
garden
behind
in
its
blaze
of
flowers
and
strayed
off
into
the
subdued
twilight
of
the
copse
where
everything
was
in
a
half
tone
of
greenness
and
shadow
and
waning
light
there
are
always
new
lights
arising
on
a
creature
like
you
and
that
makes
one
think
do
you
know
you
are
not
at
all
the
person
to
take
a
great
disappointment
quietly
if
that
should
happen
to
come
to
you
in
your
life
a
great
disappointment
she
said
looking
up
at
him
with
a
wondering
glance
then
he
thought
the
colour
paled
a
little
in
her
face
no
she
said
i
do
suppose
i
should
take
it
quietly
who
does
oh
many
people
people
with
less
determination
and
more
patience
than
you
you
are
not
very
patient
by
nature
elinor
i
never
said
i
was
and
though
no
one
would
give
up
more
generously
as
a
voluntary
matter
you
could
not
bear
being
made
a
nonentity
of
or
put
in
a
secondary
place
i
should
not
like
it
i
suppose
you
would
give
everything
flinging
it
away
but
to
have
all
your
sacrifices
taken
for
granted
your
tastes
made
of
no
account
there
was
no
doubt
now
that
she
had
grown
pale
may
i
ask
what
all
these
investigations
into
my
character
mean
i
never
was
so
anatomized
before
it
was
only
to
say
that
you
are
not
a
good
subject
for
this
kind
of
experiment
elinor
i
do
see
you
putting
up
with
things
making
the
best
of
everything
submitting
to
have
your
sense
of
right
and
wrong
outraged
perhaps
some
women
would
not
be
much
disturbed
by
that
they
would
put
off
the
responsibility
and
feel
it
their
duty
to
accept
whatever
was
put
before
them
but
you
it
would
be
a
different
matter
with
you
i
should
hope
so
if
i
was
ever
exposed
to
such
dangers
but
now
may
i
know
what
you
are
driving
at
john
for
you
have
some
meaning
in
what
you
say
he
took
her
hand
and
drew
it
through
his
arm
he
was
in
more
moved
than
he
wished
to
show
only
this
elinor
he
said
oh
john
will
you
never
call
me
nelly
any
more
only
this
nelly
my
little
nelly
never
mine
again
and
that
never
was
mine
except
in
my
silly
thought
only
this
that
if
you
have
the
least
doubt
the
smallest
flutter
of
an
uncertainty
just
enough
to
make
you
hold
your
breath
for
a
moment
oh
my
dear
girl
stop
do
go
on
with
it
pause
until
you
can
make
sure
john
she
forced
her
arm
from
his
with
an
indignant
movement
oh
how
do
you
dare
to
say
it
she
said
doubt
of
compton
uncertainty
about
phil
she
laughed
out
and
the
echo
seemed
to
ring
into
all
the
recesses
of
the
trees
i
would
be
much
more
ready
to
doubt
myself
she
said
doubt
yourself
that
is
what
i
mean
think
if
you
are
not
deceiving
yourself
i
do
think
you
are
so
very
sure
as
you
believe
you
are
nelly
you
do
feel
so
certain
do
you
know
that
you
are
insulting
me
john
you
say
as
much
as
that
i
am
a
fool
carried
away
by
a
momentary
enthusiasm
with
no
real
love
no
true
feeling
in
me
tempted
perhaps
as
hudson
thinks
by
the
honourable
her
lip
quivered
and
the
fading
colour
came
back
in
a
rush
to
her
face
it
is
hard
enough
to
have
a
woman
like
that
think
it
who
ought
to
know
better
who
has
always
known
me
but
you
john
you
may
be
sure
elinor
that
i
did
not
put
it
on
that
ground
no
perhaps
but
on
ground
not
much
more
respectful
to
me
perhaps
that
i
have
been
fascinated
by
a
handsome
man
which
is
not
considered
derogatory
oh
john
a
girl
does
not
give
herself
away
on
an
argument
like
that
i
may
be
hasty
and
and
impatient
as
you
say
but
when
you
love
her
face
flushed
like
a
rose
so
that
even
in
the
grey
of
the
evening
it
shone
out
like
one
of
the
clouds
full
of
sunset
that
still
lingered
on
the
sky
a
few
quick
tears
followed
the
natural
consequence
of
her
emotion
and
then
she
turned
to
him
with
the
ineffable
condescension
of
one
farther
advanced
in
life
stooping
sweetly
to
his
ignorance
you
have
not
yet
come
to
the
moment
in
your
experience
when
you
can
understand
that
dear
john
oh
the
insight
and
the
ignorance
the
knowledge
and
the
absence
of
all
perception
he
too
laughed
out
as
she
had
done
with
a
sense
of
the
intolerable
ridicule
and
folly
and
mistake
perhaps
that
how
it
is
he
said
elinor
looked
at
him
gravely
in
an
way
and
then
she
took
his
arm
quietly
and
turned
towards
home
i
shall
forget
what
you
have
said
and
you
will
forget
that
you
ever
said
it
and
now
we
will
go
home
john
and
be
just
the
same
dear
friends
as
before
will
you
promise
me
he
said
that
whatever
happens
without
pride
or
recollection
of
what
i
been
so
foolish
as
to
say
in
any
need
or
emergency
or
whenever
you
want
anything
or
if
you
should
be
in
trouble
trouble
comes
to
everybody
in
this
life
you
will
remember
what
you
have
said
just
now
and
send
for
your
cousin
john
her
whole
face
beamed
out
in
one
smile
she
clasped
her
other
hand
round
his
arm
i
should
have
done
it
without
being
asked
without
ever
doubting
for
a
moment
because
it
was
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
whom
should
i
turn
to
else
if
not
to
my
dear
old
but
call
me
nelly
john
dear
little
nelly
he
said
with
faltering
voice
then
that
is
a
bargain
she
held
up
her
cheek
to
him
and
he
kissed
it
solemnly
in
the
shadow
of
the
little
young
oak
that
fluttered
its
leaves
wistfully
in
the
breeze
that
was
getting
up
and
then
very
soberly
saying
little
they
walked
back
to
the
cottage
he
was
going
abroad
for
his
vacation
not
saying
to
himself
even
that
he
preferred
not
to
be
present
at
the
wedding
but
resigning
himself
to
the
necessity
for
it
was
not
to
be
till
the
middle
of
september
and
it
would
be
breaking
up
his
holiday
had
he
to
come
back
at
that
time
so
this
little
interview
was
a
as
well
as
a
solemn
engagement
for
all
the
risks
and
dangers
of
life
the
pain
in
it
after
that
very
sharp
moment
in
the
copse
was
softened
down
into
a
sadness
not
unsweet
as
they
came
silently
together
from
out
of
the
shadow
into
the
quiet
hemisphere
of
sky
and
space
which
was
over
the
little
centre
of
the
cottage
with
its
human
glimmer
of
fire
and
lights
the
sky
was
unusually
clear
and
among
those
soft
clouds
of
the
sunset
which
were
no
clouds
at
all
had
risen
a
young
crescent
of
a
moon
just
about
to
disappear
too
in
the
short
course
of
one
of
her
earliest
nights
they
lingered
for
a
moment
before
they
went
indoors
the
depth
of
the
combe
was
filled
with
the
growing
darkness
but
the
ridges
above
were
still
light
and
softly
edged
with
the
silver
of
the
moon
and
the
distant
road
like
a
long
white
line
came
conspicuously
into
sight
winding
for
a
little
way
along
the
unsheltered
before
it
plunged
into
the
shadow
of
the
trees
the
road
that
led
into
the
world
by
which
they
should
both
depart
presently
to
stray
into
such
different
ways
chapter
vi
the
after
dinner
always
looked
cheerful
perhaps
the
fact
that
it
was
a
sort
of
little
oasis
in
the
desert
and
that
the
light
from
those
windows
shone
into
three
counties
made
the
interior
more
cosy
and
bright
there
are
houses
now
upon
every
knoll
and
the
wind
can
not
blow
on
windyhill
for
the
quantity
of
obstructions
it
meets
with
there
was
the
usual
log
burning
on
the
hearth
and
the
party
in
general
kept
away
from
it
for
the
night
was
warm
only
sharp
the
london
lawyer
was
equal
to
bearing
the
heat
he
stood
with
his
back
to
it
and
his
long
legs
showing
against
the
glow
behind
a
long
man
in
black
who
had
immediately
suggested
mephistopheles
to
elinor
even
though
he
was
on
the
compton
side
he
had
taken
his
coffee
after
dinner
and
now
he
stood
over
the
fire
slowly
sipping
a
cup
of
tea
there
was
a
look
of
acquisitiveness
about
him
which
suggested
an
inclination
to
appropriate
anything
from
the
unnecessary
heat
of
the
fire
to
the
equally
unnecessary
tea
but
sharp
had
been
on
the
winning
side
he
had
demonstrated
the
superior
sense
of
making
the
money
which
was
not
large
enough
sum
to
settle
of
real
use
to
the
young
pair
by
an
investment
which
would
increase
importance
in
his
company
besides
producing
very
good
dividends
much
better
dividends
than
would
be
possible
if
it
were
treated
in
the
way
by
trustees
this
was
how
the
bride
wished
it
which
was
the
most
telling
of
arguments
and
surely
to
insure
good
interest
and
an
increase
of
capital
to
her
through
her
husband
hands
was
better
than
to
secure
some
beggarly
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
a
year
for
her
portion
though
without
any
risks
at
all
sharp
had
also
taken
great
pains
to
point
out
that
there
were
only
three
brothers
one
an
invalid
and
the
other
two
soldiers
between
phil
and
the
title
and
that
even
to
be
the
honourable
compton
was
something
for
a
young
lady
who
was
if
he
might
venture
to
say
so
nobody
not
to
say
a
word
against
her
charms
lord
serf
was
hourly
getting
an
old
man
and
the
chances
that
his
client
might
step
over
a
hecatomb
of
dead
relations
to
the
height
of
fortune
was
a
thing
quite
worth
taking
into
account
it
was
a
much
better
argument
however
to
return
to
the
analogy
of
other
poor
young
people
where
the
little
fortune
would
be
put
into
the
husband
business
and
thus
their
joint
advantage
considered
sharp
at
the
same
time
did
not
hesitate
to
express
politely
his
opinion
that
to
call
him
down
to
the
country
for
a
discussion
which
could
have
been
carried
on
much
better
in
one
or
other
of
their
respective
offices
was
a
most
uncalled
for
proceeding
especially
as
even
now
the
other
side
was
wavering
and
would
not
consent
to
conclude
matters
and
make
the
signatures
that
were
necessary
at
once
lynch
it
must
be
allowed
was
of
the
same
opinion
too
your
country
is
a
little
bleak
at
night
said
sharp
partially
mollified
by
a
good
dinner
but
beginning
to
remember
unpleasantly
the
cold
drive
in
a
rattletrap
of
a
little
rustic
pony
carriage
over
the
hills
and
hollows
do
you
really
remain
here
all
the
year
how
wonderful
not
even
a
glimpse
of
the
world
in
summer
or
a
little
escape
from
the
chills
in
winter
how
brave
of
you
what
patience
and
powers
of
endurance
must
be
cultivated
in
that
way
one
would
think
windyhill
was
siberia
at
least
said
dennistoun
laughing
we
do
not
give
ourselves
credit
for
all
these
fine
qualities
some
people
are
heroes
or
heroines
without
knowing
it
said
sharp
with
a
bow
and
yet
said
the
mother
with
a
little
indignation
there
was
some
talk
of
compton
doing
me
the
honour
to
share
my
hermitage
for
a
part
of
the
year
compton
my
dear
lady
compton
would
die
of
it
in
a
week
said
sharp
i
am
quite
well
aware
of
it
said
dennistoun
and
she
added
after
a
pause
so
should
i
what
a
change
it
will
be
for
your
daughter
said
sharp
she
will
see
everything
that
is
worth
seeing
more
in
a
month
than
she
would
see
here
in
a
dozen
years
trust
compton
for
knowing
all
that
worth
going
after
they
have
all
an
instinct
for
life
that
is
quite
remarkable
there
lady
mariamne
who
has
society
at
her
feet
and
the
old
lord
is
a
most
remarkable
old
gentleman
your
daughter
dennistoun
is
a
very
fortunate
young
lady
she
has
my
best
congratulations
i
am
sure
sharp
said
lynch
from
the
background
you
had
better
be
thinking
of
starting
if
you
want
to
catch
that
train
i
see
if
the
pony
is
there
said
john
sharp
put
down
his
teacup
with
precipitation
is
it
as
late
as
that
he
cried
it
is
the
last
train
said
dennistoun
with
great
satisfaction
and
i
am
afraid
if
you
missed
it
as
the
house
is
full
there
would
be
nothing
but
a
bed
at
the
to
offer
oh
not
another
word
the
lawyer
said
and
fortunately
he
never
knew
how
near
that
rising
young
man
at
the
bar
john
tatham
who
had
every
object
in
conciliating
a
solicitor
was
to
a
charge
of
manslaughter
if
killing
an
attorney
can
thus
be
called
but
the
feelings
of
the
party
were
expressed
only
in
actions
of
the
greatest
kindness
they
helped
him
on
with
his
coat
and
covered
him
with
rugs
as
he
got
in
shivering
to
the
little
pony
carriage
it
was
a
beautiful
night
but
the
wind
is
always
a
thing
to
be
considered
on
windyhill
well
that
a
good
thing
over
said
lynch
going
to
the
fire
as
he
came
in
from
the
night
air
at
the
door
and
rubbing
his
hands
it
would
have
been
a
relief
to
one
feeling
to
have
kicked
that
fellow
all
the
way
down
and
up
the
other
side
of
the
combe
and
kept
him
warm
said
john
with
a
laugh
of
wrath
it
is
a
pity
a
man
should
have
so
little
taste
said
dennistoun
elinor
still
stood
where
she
had
been
standing
with
every
feeling
in
her
breast
in
commotion
she
had
not
taken
any
part
in
the
insidious
kindnesses
of
speeding
the
parting
guest
and
now
she
remembered
that
he
was
her
phil
representative
whatever
she
might
herself
think
of
the
man
how
could
she
join
in
abuse
of
one
who
represented
phil
he
is
no
worse
i
suppose
than
others
she
said
he
was
bound
to
stand
up
for
those
in
whose
interest
he
was
lynch
would
have
made
himself
quite
as
disagreeable
for
me
not
i
said
the
old
gentleman
for
what
is
the
good
of
standing
up
for
you
you
would
throw
me
over
on
the
first
opportunity
you
have
taken
all
the
force
out
of
my
my
dear
as
it
is
how
can
i
make
myself
disagreeable
for
those
who
wo
stand
up
for
themselves
i
suppose
you
must
have
it
your
own
way
yes
i
suppose
it
will
be
the
best
said
dennistoun
in
subdued
tones
it
would
come
to
about
the
same
thing
however
you
settled
it
said
john
elinor
looked
from
one
to
another
with
eyes
that
began
to
glow
you
are
a
cheerful
company
she
said
you
speak
as
if
you
were
arranging
my
funeral
on
the
whole
i
think
i
like
sharp
best
for
if
he
was
contemptuous
of
me
and
my
little
bit
of
money
he
was
at
all
events
cheerful
about
the
future
and
that
is
always
something
whereas
you
all
there
was
a
little
pause
no
one
responding
there
was
no
pleasant
jest
no
bright
augury
for
elinor
the
girl
heart
rose
against
this
gloom
that
surrounded
her
i
think
she
said
with
an
angry
laugh
that
i
had
better
run
after
sharp
and
bring
him
back
for
he
had
at
least
a
little
sympathy
with
me
do
be
too
sure
of
that
said
lynch
for
if
we
think
you
are
throwing
yourself
away
elinor
so
does
he
on
his
side
he
thinks
the
honourable
compton
is
going
dreadfully
cheap
for
five
thousand
pounds
elinor
need
not
take
any
of
us
pied
de
la
of
course
we
are
all
firm
for
our
own
side
said
john
elinor
turned
her
head
from
one
to
another
growing
pale
and
red
by
turns
there
was
a
certain
surprise
in
her
look
as
she
found
herself
thus
at
bay
the
triumph
of
having
got
the
better
of
their
opposition
was
lost
in
the
sense
of
isolation
with
which
the
girl
so
long
the
first
object
of
everybody
about
her
felt
herself
thus
placed
alone
and
the
tears
were
very
ready
to
start
but
were
kept
back
by
jealous
pride
which
rose
to
her
help
well
if
they
put
her
outside
the
circle
she
would
remain
so
if
they
talked
to
her
as
one
no
longer
of
them
but
belonging
to
another
life
so
be
it
elinor
determined
that
she
would
make
no
further
appeal
she
would
not
even
show
how
much
it
hurt
her
after
that
pale
look
round
upon
them
all
she
went
into
the
corner
of
the
room
where
the
piano
stood
and
where
there
was
little
light
she
was
too
proud
to
go
out
of
the
room
lest
they
should
think
she
was
going
to
cry
she
went
with
a
sudden
quick
movement
to
the
piano
instead
where
perhaps
she
might
cry
too
but
where
nobody
should
see
poor
elinor
they
had
made
her
feel
alone
by
their
words
and
she
made
herself
more
alone
by
this
little
instinctive
withdrawal
she
began
to
play
softly
one
thing
after
another
she
was
not
a
great
performer
her
little
tunes
were
of
the
simplest
no
better
indeed
than
tunes
things
that
every
musician
despises
they
made
a
little
atmosphere
round
her
a
voluntary
hermitage
which
separated
her
as
if
she
had
been
a
hundred
miles
away
i
wish
you
could
have
stayed
for
the
marriage
dennistoun
said
my
dear
lady
it
would
spoil
my
holiday
the
middle
of
september
you
have
nobody
except
of
course
the
people
you
have
always
to
tell
the
truth
john
added
i
do
care
tuppence
for
my
holiday
have
come
like
a
shot
but
i
do
think
i
could
stand
it
she
has
always
been
such
a
pet
of
mine
i
do
think
i
could
bear
it
to
tell
the
truth
i
shall
have
to
bear
it
though
she
is
more
than
a
pet
of
mine
said
dennistoun
i
know
i
know
the
relatives
can
not
be
let
off
especially
the
mother
who
must
put
up
with
everything
i
trust
said
lynch
with
a
sigh
that
it
may
all
turn
out
a
great
deal
better
than
we
hope
where
are
they
going
after
the
marriage
some
one
has
lent
them
a
place
a
very
pretty
place
on
the
thames
where
they
can
have
boating
and
all
that
lord
sudbury
i
think
and
later
they
are
going
on
a
round
of
visits
to
his
father
lord
serf
and
to
lady
mariamne
and
to
his
aunt
who
is
countess
of
something
or
other
dennistoun
voice
was
not
untouched
by
a
certain
vague
pleasure
in
these
fine
names
ah
said
the
old
lawyer
nodding
his
head
at
each
all
among
the
aristocracy
i
see
well
my
dear
lady
i
hope
you
will
be
able
to
find
some
satisfaction
in
that
it
is
better
than
to
fall
among
nobodies
at
least
i
hope
so
said
dennistoun
with
a
sigh
they
were
speaking
low
and
fondly
hoped
that
they
were
not
heard
but
elinor
ears
and
every
faculty
were
quickened
and
almost
every
word
reached
her
but
she
was
too
proud
to
take
any
notice
and
perhaps
these
dreary
anticipations
on
the
whole
did
her
good
for
her
heart
rose
against
them
and
any
little
possible
doubts
in
her
own
mind
were
put
to
sudden
flight
by
the
opposition
and
determination
which
flooded
her
heart
this
made
her
playing
a
little
more
unsteady
than
usual
and
she
broke
down
several
times
in
the
middle
of
a
tune
but
nobody
remarked
this
they
were
all
fully
occupied
with
their
own
thoughts
all
at
least
except
john
who
wandered
uneasily
about
the
room
now
studying
the
names
of
the
books
on
the
bookshelves
which
he
knew
by
heart
now
pulling
the
curtain
aside
to
look
out
at
the
moonlight
now
pulling
at
the
fronds
of
the
great
maidenhair
in
his
distraction
till
the
table
round
was
scattered
with
little
broken
leaves
he
wanted
to
keep
out
of
that
atmosphere
of
emotion
which
surrounded
elinor
at
the
piano
but
it
attracted
him
all
the
same
as
the
light
attracts
a
moth
to
get
away
from
that
to
make
the
severance
which
so
soon
must
be
a
perfect
severance
was
the
only
true
policy
he
knew
for
what
was
he
to
her
and
what
could
she
be
to
him
he
had
already
said
everything
which
a
man
in
his
position
ought
to
say
he
took
out
a
book
at
last
and
sat
down
doggedly
by
the
table
to
read
thus
making
another
circle
of
atmosphere
so
to
speak
another
globe
of
isolated
being
in
the
little
room
while
the
two
elder
people
talked
low
in
the
centre
conventionally
inaudible
to
the
girl
who
was
playing
and
the
young
man
who
was
reading
but
john
might
as
well
have
tried
to
solve
some
tremendous
problem
as
to
read
that
book
he
too
heard
every
word
the
elders
were
saying
he
heard
them
with
his
own
ears
and
also
he
heard
them
through
the
ears
of
elinor
gauging
the
effect
which
every
word
would
have
upon
her
at
last
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
he
was
driven
to
her
side
to
bear
a
part
of
her
burden
even
to
prevent
her
from
hearing
which
would
be
something
he
resisted
the
impulse
to
throw
down
his
book
and
only
placed
it
very
quietly
on
the
table
and
even
in
a
deliberate
way
that
there
might
be
no
appearance
of
feeling
about
him
and
made
his
way
by
degrees
pausing
now
and
then
to
look
at
a
picture
though
he
knew
them
all
by
heart
thus
he
arrived
at
last
at
the
piano
in
what
he
flattered
himself
was
an
accidental
way
elinor
the
stars
are
so
bright
over
the
combe
do
come
out
it
is
not
often
they
are
so
clear
no
she
said
more
with
the
movement
of
her
lips
than
with
any
sound
why
not
you
ca
want
to
play
those
old
pieces
just
at
this
moment
you
will
have
plenty
of
time
to
play
them
she
said
no
again
with
a
little
impatient
movement
of
her
hands
on
the
keys
and
a
look
towards
the
others
you
are
listening
to
what
they
are
saying
why
should
you
they
want
you
to
hear
come
along
elinor
it
far
better
for
you
not
to
listen
to
what
is
not
intended
oh
go
away
john
i
must
say
no
in
my
turn
leave
the
tunes
till
and
come
out
with
me
i
thought
she
said
roused
a
little
that
you
were
fond
of
music
john
this
brought
john
up
suddenly
in
an
unexpected
way
oh
as
for
that
he
said
in
a
dubious
tone
poor
elinor
tunes
were
not
music
in
his
sense
as
she
very
well
knew
she
laughed
in
a
forlorn
way
i
know
what
you
mean
but
this
is
quite
good
enough
for
what
i
shall
want
i
am
going
down
you
know
to
a
different
level
altogether
oh
you
can
hear
for
yourself
what
mamma
and
lynch
are
saying
going
up
you
mean
elinor
i
thought
them
both
very
complaisant
over
all
those
titles
ah
she
said
they
say
that
mocking
they
think
i
am
going
down
so
do
you
too
to
the
land
of
mere
fast
people
people
with
no
sense
well
there
is
nothing
but
the
trial
will
teach
any
of
us
we
shall
see
it
is
rather
a
dreadful
risk
to
run
if
it
only
a
trial
elinor
a
trial
for
you
not
for
me
i
am
not
the
one
that
thinks
so
except
so
far
as
the
tunes
are
concerned
she
said
with
a
laugh
i
confess
so
far
as
that
lady
mariamne
is
fond
of
a
comic
song
i
do
think
she
goes
any
further
i
shall
be
good
enough
for
them
in
the
way
of
music
i
should
be
content
never
to
hear
another
note
of
music
all
my
life
elinor
if
ah
there
you
begin
again
not
you
john
not
you
i
ca
bear
any
more
neither
stars
nor
walks
nor
listening
no
more
this
rather
and
she
brought
down
her
hands
with
a
great
crash
upon
the
piano
making
every
one
start
then
elinor
rose
having
produced
her
effect
i
think
it
must
be
time
to
go
to
bed
mamma
john
is
talking
of
the
stars
which
means
that
he
wants
his
cigar
and
lynch
must
want
just
to
look
at
the
tray
in
the
and
you
are
tired
by
all
this
fuss
all
this
unnatural
fuss
about
me
that
am
not
worth
come
mother
to
bed
chapter
vii
the
days
in
the
cottage
were
full
of
excitement
and
of
occupation
during
the
blazing
august
weather
not
so
much
indeed
as
is
common
in
many
houses
in
which
the
expectant
bridegroom
is
always
coming
and
going
though
perhaps
the
place
of
that
exhilarating
commotion
was
more
or
less
filled
by
the
diversity
of
opinion
the
excitement
of
a
subdued
but
conflict
in
which
one
was
always
on
the
defensive
and
the
other
covertly
or
openly
attacking
or
at
least
believed
to
be
so
doing
the
distant
and
unseen
object
to
which
all
their
thoughts
turned
dennistoun
indeed
was
not
always
aggressive
her
opposition
was
but
in
fits
and
starts
often
her
feelings
of
pain
and
alarm
were
quiescent
in
that
unfeigned
and
salutary
interest
in
clothes
and
necessities
of
preparation
which
is
almost
always
a
resource
to
a
woman
mind
it
is
wrong
to
undervalue
this
possibility
which
compensates
a
woman
in
a
small
degree
for
some
of
her
special
troubles
when
the
mother
heart
was
very
heavy
it
was
often
diverted
a
little
by
the
discussion
of
a
dinner
dress
or
made
to
forget
itself
for
the
moment
in
a
question
about
the
cut
of
a
sleeve
or
which
would
be
most
becoming
to
elinor
of
two
colours
for
a
ball
gown
but
though
dennistoun
forgot
often
elinor
never
forgot
the
dresses
and
things
generally
occupied
her
a
great
deal
but
not
in
the
form
of
the
anodyne
which
they
supplied
to
her
mother
her
mind
was
always
on
the
alert
looking
out
for
those
flying
arrows
of
warfare
which
your
true
fighter
lets
fly
in
the
most
innocent
conversation
at
the
most
unexpected
moments
elinor
thus
flung
her
shield
in
her
mother
face
a
hundred
times
when
that
poor
lady
was
thinking
no
evil
when
she
was
altogether
occupied
by
the
question
of
frills
and
laces
or
whether
tucks
or
flounces
were
best
and
she
was
startled
many
times
by
that
unnecessary
rattle
of
elinor
arms
i
was
not
thinking
of
compton
she
would
sometimes
be
driven
to
say
he
was
not
in
my
head
at
all
i
was
thinking
of
nothing
more
important
than
that
walking
dress
and
what
you
had
best
wear
in
the
afternoon
when
you
are
on
those
grand
visits
there
was
one
thing
which
occasioned
a
little
discussion
between
them
and
that
was
the
necessary
civility
of
asking
the
neighbours
to
inspect
these
things
when
they
were
finally
ready
it
was
only
the
argument
that
these
neighbours
would
be
dennistoun
sole
resource
when
she
was
left
alone
that
made
elinor
assent
at
last
perhaps
however
as
she
walked
quickly
along
towards
the
moorland
rectory
a
certain
satisfaction
in
showing
them
how
little
their
hints
had
been
taken
mingled
with
the
reluctance
to
admit
those
people
who
had
breathed
a
doubt
upon
the
sacred
name
of
phil
to
such
a
sign
of
intimacy
i
have
been
watching
you
along
the
side
of
the
combe
and
wondering
if
it
was
you
such
a
threatening
day
said
alice
hudson
coming
to
the
door
to
meet
her
how
nice
of
you
to
come
elinor
when
you
must
be
so
busy
and
you
have
not
been
here
since
i
do
know
how
long
ago
no
i
have
not
been
here
said
elinor
with
a
gravity
worthy
the
bride
of
a
maligned
man
but
the
time
is
so
near
when
i
shall
not
be
able
to
come
at
all
that
i
thought
it
was
best
mamma
wishes
you
to
come
over
if
you
will
to
see
my
things
oh
the
three
ladies
said
together
and
hudson
came
forward
and
gave
elinor
a
kiss
my
dear
she
said
i
take
it
very
kind
you
coming
yourself
to
ask
us
many
would
not
have
done
it
after
what
we
felt
it
our
duty
but
you
always
had
a
beautiful
spirit
elinor
bearing
no
malice
and
i
hope
with
all
my
heart
that
it
will
have
its
reward
well
mother
said
alice
i
do
see
how
elinor
could
do
anything
less
seeing
we
have
been
such
friends
all
our
lives
as
girls
she
and
i
and
i
am
sure
i
have
always
been
ready
to
give
her
patterns
or
to
show
her
how
a
thing
was
done
i
should
have
been
very
much
disappointed
if
she
had
not
asked
me
to
see
her
things
mary
dale
who
was
hudson
sister
said
nothing
at
all
but
accepted
the
visit
as
in
the
course
of
nature
mary
was
the
one
who
really
knew
something
about
phil
compton
but
she
had
been
against
the
remonstrance
which
hudson
thought
it
her
duty
to
make
what
was
the
good
miss
dale
had
said
and
she
had
refrained
from
telling
two
or
three
stories
about
the
comptons
which
would
have
made
the
hair
stand
upright
on
the
heads
of
the
rector
and
the
rectoress
she
did
not
even
now
say
that
it
was
kind
but
met
elinor
in
silence
as
in
her
position
as
the
not
important
member
of
the
family
it
was
quite
becoming
for
her
to
do
then
the
rector
came
in
and
took
her
by
both
hands
and
gave
her
the
most
friendly
greeting
i
heard
elinor
voice
and
i
stopped
in
the
middle
of
my
sermon
he
said
you
will
remark
in
church
on
sunday
a
jerky
piece
which
shows
how
i
stopped
to
reflect
whether
it
could
be
you
and
then
went
on
for
another
sentence
and
then
decided
that
it
must
be
you
there
is
a
big
elinor
written
across
my
sermon
paper
he
laughed
but
he
was
a
little
moved
to
see
after
the
coolness
the
little
girl
whom
he
had
christened
come
back
to
her
old
friends
again
she
has
come
to
ask
us
to
go
and
see
her
things
papa
said
hudson
twinkling
an
eye
to
get
rid
of
a
suspicion
of
a
tear
am
i
to
come
too
said
the
rector
and
thus
the
little
incident
of
the
reconciliation
was
got
over
to
the
great
content
of
all
elinor
reflected
to
herself
that
they
were
really
kind
people
as
she
went
out
again
into
the
grey
afternoon
where
everything
was
getting
up
for
rain
she
made
up
her
mind
she
would
just
have
time
to
run
into
the
hills
at
the
hurst
and
leave
her
message
and
so
get
home
before
the
storm
began
the
clouds
lay
low
like
a
dark
grey
hood
over
the
and
moorland
shaggy
tops
of
the
downs
all
round
there
was
not
a
break
anywhere
in
the
consistent
grey
and
the
air
always
so
brisk
had
fallen
still
with
that
ominous
lull
that
comes
over
everything
before
a
convulsion
of
nature
some
birds
were
still
hurrying
home
into
the
depths
of
the
copses
with
a
frightened
straightness
of
flight
as
if
they
were
afraid
they
would
not
get
back
in
time
and
all
the
insects
that
are
so
gay
with
their
humming
and
booming
had
disappeared
under
leaves
and
stones
and
grasses
elinor
saw
a
bee
burrowing
deep
in
the
waxen
trumpet
of
a
foxglove
as
if
taking
shelter
as
she
walked
quickly
past
the
hills
there
were
two
sisters
of
them
with
an
old
mother
too
old
for
such
diversion
as
the
inspection
of
in
the
background
would
scarcely
let
elinor
go
out
again
after
they
had
accepted
her
invitation
with
rapture
i
was
just
wondering
where
i
should
see
the
new
fashions
said
miss
hill
for
though
we
are
not
going
to
be
married
we
must
begin
to
think
about
our
winter
things
and
this
will
be
such
an
opportunity
said
miss
susan
and
so
good
of
you
to
come
yourself
to
ask
us
what
has
she
come
to
ask
you
to
said
old
hill
the
wedding
i
told
you
girls
i
was
sure
you
would
not
be
left
out
why
i
knew
her
mother
before
she
was
married
i
have
known
them
all
man
and
boy
for
nearer
sixty
than
fifty
years
before
her
mother
was
born
to
have
left
you
out
would
have
been
ridiculous
yes
yes
elinor
my
dear
tell
your
mother
they
will
come
delighted
they
have
been
thinking
for
the
last
fortnight
what
bonnets
they
would
wear
oh
mother
and
oh
elinor
said
the
girls
you
must
not
mind
what
mother
says
we
know
very
well
that
you
must
have
worlds
of
people
to
ask
do
think
among
all
your
new
connections
of
such
little
country
mice
as
us
we
shall
always
just
take
the
same
interest
in
you
dear
child
whether
you
find
you
can
ask
us
or
not
but
of
course
you
are
asked
said
elinor
in
de
not
reflecting
that
her
mother
had
begun
to
be
in
despair
about
the
number
of
people
who
could
be
entertained
in
the
cottage
and
you
must
not
talk
about
my
new
grand
connections
for
nobody
will
ever
be
like
my
old
friends
dear
child
they
said
and
i
always
knew
that
dear
elinor
heart
was
in
the
right
place
but
it
was
all
that
elinor
could
do
to
get
free
of
their
eager
affection
and
alarm
lest
she
should
be
caught
in
the
rain
both
of
the
ladies
produced
waterproofs
and
one
a
large
pair
of
goloshes
to
fortify
her
when
it
was
found
that
she
would
go
and
they
stood
in
the
porch
watching
her
as
she
went
along
into
the
darkening
afternoon
without
any
of
their
covers
and
shelters
the
miss
hills
were
apt
to
cling
together
after
the
manner
of
those
pairs
of
sweet
sisters
in
the
books
of
beauty
which
had
been
the
delight
of
their
youth
they
stood
with
arms
intertwined
in
their
porch
watching
elinor
as
she
hurried
home
with
her
light
step
like
the
belated
birds
did
you
hear
what
she
said
about
old
friends
poor
little
thing
i
wonder
if
she
is
finding
out
already
that
her
new
grand
connections
are
but
vanity
they
said
shaking
their
heads
the
sisters
looked
out
of
the
sheltered
home
which
perhaps
they
had
not
chosen
for
themselves
with
a
sort
of
wistful
feeling
half
pity
perhaps
half
envy
upon
the
poor
little
thing
who
was
running
out
so
into
the
storm
they
had
long
ago
retired
into
waterproofs
and
goloshes
and
had
much
unwillingness
to
wet
their
feet
which
things
are
a
parable
they
went
back
and
closed
the
door
only
when
the
first
flash
of
lightning
dazzled
them
and
they
remembered
that
an
open
door
is
dangerous
during
a
thunderstorm
elinor
quickened
her
pace
as
the
storm
began
and
got
home
breathless
with
running
shaking
off
the
first
big
drops
of
from
her
dress
but
she
did
not
think
of
any
danger
and
sat
out
in
the
porch
watching
how
the
darkness
came
down
on
the
combe
how
it
was
met
with
the
jagged
gleam
of
the
great
white
flash
and
how
the
thunderous
explosion
shook
the
earth
the
combe
with
its
on
either
side
became
like
the
scene
of
a
battle
great
armies
invisible
in
the
sharp
torrents
of
rain
meeting
each
other
with
a
fierce
shock
and
recoil
with
now
and
then
a
and
now
the
gleam
that
lit
up
tree
and
copse
and
anon
the
tremendous
artillery
when
the
lightning
came
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
winding
line
of
the
white
road
leading
away
out
of
all
this
leading
into
the
world
where
she
was
going
and
for
a
moment
escaped
by
it
even
amid
the
roar
of
all
the
elements
then
came
back
alighting
again
with
a
start
in
the
familiar
porch
amid
all
the
surroundings
of
the
familiar
life
to
feel
her
mother
hand
upon
her
shoulder
and
her
mother
voice
saying
have
you
got
wet
my
darling
did
you
get
much
of
it
come
in
come
in
from
the
storm
it
is
so
glorious
mamma
dennistoun
stood
for
a
few
minutes
looking
at
it
then
with
a
shudder
withdrew
into
the
i
think
i
have
seen
too
many
storms
to
like
it
she
said
but
elinor
had
not
seen
too
many
storms
she
sat
and
watched
it
now
rolling
away
towards
the
south
and
bursting
again
as
though
one
army
or
the
other
had
got
reinforcements
while
the
flash
of
the
explosions
and
the
roar
of
the
guns
and
the
white
blast
of
the
rain
falling
like
a
sheet
from
the
leaden
skies
wrapped
everything
in
mystery
the
only
thing
that
was
to
be
identified
from
time
to
time
was
that
bit
of
road
leading
out
of
it
leading
her
thoughts
away
as
it
should
one
day
lead
her
eager
feet
from
all
the
storm
and
turmoil
out
into
the
bright
and
shining
world
elinor
never
asked
herself
as
she
sat
there
a
spectator
of
this
great
conflict
of
nature
whether
that
one
human
thing
by
which
her
swift
thoughts
traversed
the
storm
carried
any
other
suggestion
as
of
coming
back
perhaps
it
is
betraying
feminine
counsels
too
much
to
the
modest
public
to
narrate
how
elinor
things
were
all
laid
out
for
the
inspection
of
the
ladies
of
the
parish
the
dresses
in
one
room
the
under
things
in
another
and
in
the
the
presents
which
everybody
was
doubly
curious
to
see
to
compare
their
own
offerings
with
those
of
other
people
or
else
to
note
with
anxious
eye
what
was
wanting
in
order
if
their
present
had
not
yet
been
procured
to
supply
the
gap
how
to
get
something
that
would
look
well
among
the
others
and
yet
not
be
too
expensive
was
a
problem
which
the
country
neighbours
had
much
and
painfully
considered
the
hudsons
had
given
elinor
a
little
upon
a
stand
which
they
were
painfully
conscious
was
only
plated
and
sadly
afraid
would
not
look
well
among
all
the
gorgeous
articles
with
which
no
doubt
her
grand
new
connections
had
loaded
her
the
rector
came
himself
with
his
ladies
to
see
how
the
kettle
looked
with
a
great
line
of
anxiety
between
his
brows
but
when
they
saw
that
the
revolving
dishes
beside
it
which
were
the
gift
of
the
wealthy
lady
mariamne
were
plated
too
and
not
nearly
such
a
pretty
design
their
hearts
went
up
in
instant
exhilaration
followed
a
moment
after
by
such
indignation
as
they
could
scarcely
restrain
that
rich
sister
the
woman
who
married
the
jew
which
was
their
very
natural
explanation
of
the
nickname
a
woman
who
is
rolling
in
wealth
and
who
actually
made
up
the
match
this
was
crescendo
a
height
of
scorn
impossible
to
describe
upon
a
mere
printed
page
one
would
have
thought
she
would
have
given
a
diamond
necklace
or
something
of
consequence
said
hudson
in
her
husband
ear
or
at
least
silver
said
the
rector
these
fashionable
people
though
they
give
themselves
every
luxury
have
sometimes
not
very
much
money
to
spend
but
silver
at
least
she
might
have
been
expected
to
give
silver
it
is
simply
disgraceful
said
the
rector
wife
i
am
glad
at
all
events
my
dear
said
he
that
our
little
thing
looks
just
as
well
as
any
it
is
one
of
the
prettiest
things
she
has
got
said
hudson
with
a
proud
heart
lord
serf
sent
an
little
ring
in
a
much
worn
velvet
case
and
the
elder
brother
lord
lomond
an
album
for
photographs
the
wife
indicated
these
gifts
to
her
husband
with
little
shrugs
of
her
shoulders
if
that
all
the
family
can
do
she
said
why
cushion
which
was
worked
with
floss
silks
upon
satin
was
a
more
creditable
present
than
that
the
miss
hills
who
as
yet
had
not
had
an
opportunity
as
they
said
of
giving
their
present
roamed
about
curious
inspecting
everything
what
is
the
child
to
do
with
a
kettle
a
thing
so
difficult
to
pack
and
requiring
spirit
for
the
lamp
and
all
that
and
only
plated
the
hills
said
to
each
other
now
that
little
teapot
of
ours
said
jane
to
susan
if
mother
would
only
consent
to
it
is
no
use
to
us
and
would
look
very
handsome
here
real
silver
and
old
silver
which
is
so
much
the
rage
and
a
thing
she
could
use
every
day
when
she
has
her
visitors
for
afternoon
tea
said
susan
to
jane
it
is
rather
small
said
miss
hill
doubtfully
but
quite
enough
for
two
people
said
the
other
forgetting
that
she
had
just
declared
that
the
teapot
would
be
serviceable
when
elinor
had
visitors
but
that
was
a
small
matter
elinor
however
had
other
things
better
than
these
a
necklace
worth
half
a
year
income
from
john
tatham
which
he
had
pinched
himself
to
get
for
her
that
she
might
hold
up
her
head
among
those
great
friends
and
almost
all
that
her
mother
possessed
in
the
way
of
jewellery
which
was
enough
to
make
a
show
among
these
simple
people
her
own
family
at
least
have
done
elinor
justice
said
the
rector
going
again
to
have
a
look
at
the
kettle
which
was
the
chief
of
the
display
to
him
thus
the
visitors
made
their
remarks
the
hills
did
nothing
but
stand
apart
and
discuss
their
teapot
and
the
means
by
which
mother
could
be
got
to
assent
the
rector
took
his
cup
of
tea
always
with
a
side
glance
at
the
kettle
and
cut
his
cake
and
made
his
gentle
jest
if
alick
and
i
come
over
in
the
night
and
carry
them
all
off
you
must
not
be
surprised
he
said
such
valuable
things
as
these
in
a
little
poor
parish
are
a
dreadful
temptation
and
i
do
suppose
you
have
much
in
the
way
of
bolts
and
bars
alick
is
as
nimble
as
a
cat
he
can
get
in
at
any
crevice
and
i
bring
over
the
box
for
the
collections
to
carry
off
the
little
things
this
harmless
wit
pleased
the
good
clergyman
much
and
he
repeated
it
to
all
the
ladies
i
am
coming
over
with
alick
one
of
these
dark
nights
to
make
a
sweep
of
everything
he
said
hudson
retired
in
the
gentle
laughter
that
followed
this
feeling
that
he
had
acquitted
himself
as
a
man
ought
who
is
the
only
gentleman
present
as
well
as
the
rector
of
the
parish
i
am
afraid
i
would
not
be
a
good
judge
of
the
he
said
and
for
anything
i
know
there
may
be
mysteries
not
intended
for
men
eyes
i
like
to
see
your
pretty
dresses
when
you
are
wearing
them
but
i
ca
judge
of
their
effect
in
the
gross
he
was
a
man
who
had
a
pleasant
wit
the
ladies
all
agreed
that
the
rector
was
sure
to
make
you
laugh
whatever
was
the
occasion
and
he
walked
home
very
briskly
pleased
with
the
effect
of
the
kettle
and
saying
to
himself
that
from
the
moment
he
saw
it
in
mappin
window
he
had
felt
sure
it
was
the
very
thing
the
other
ladies
were
sufficiently
impressed
with
the
number
and
splendour
of
elinor
gowns
dennistoun
explained
with
a
humility
which
was
not
i
fear
untinctured
by
pride
that
both
number
and
variety
were
rendered
necessary
by
the
fact
that
elinor
was
going
upon
a
series
of
visits
among
her
future
husband
great
relations
and
would
have
to
be
much
in
society
and
among
fine
people
who
dressed
very
much
and
would
expect
a
great
deal
from
a
bride
of
course
in
ordinary
circumstances
the
half
of
them
would
have
been
enough
for
i
approve
of
too
many
dresses
they
get
said
hudson
gravely
before
they
are
half
worn
out
and
to
do
them
up
again
is
quite
as
expensive
as
getting
new
ones
and
not
so
satisfactory
said
the
miss
hills
the
proud
mother
allowed
both
of
these
drawbacks
but
what
could
i
do
she
said
i
can
not
have
my
child
go
away
into
such
a
different
sphere
unprovided
it
is
a
sacrifice
but
we
had
to
make
it
i
wish
she
said
looking
round
to
see
that
elinor
was
out
of
hearing
it
was
the
only
sacrifice
that
had
to
be
made
let
us
hope
said
the
rector
wife
solemnly
that
it
will
all
turn
out
for
the
best
it
will
do
that
however
it
turns
out
said
miss
dale
who
was
even
more
serious
than
it
was
incumbent
on
a
member
of
a
clerical
household
to
be
for
we
all
know
that
troubles
are
sent
for
our
advantage
as
well
as
blessings
and
poor
dear
elinor
may
require
much
discipline
oh
goodness
do
talk
as
if
the
poor
child
was
going
to
be
executed
said
susan
hill
i
am
not
at
all
alarmed
said
dennistoun
it
was
unwise
of
her
to
have
left
an
opening
for
any
such
remark
my
elinor
has
always
been
surrounded
by
love
wherever
she
has
been
her
future
husband
family
are
already
very
fond
of
her
i
am
not
at
all
alarmed
on
account
she
laid
the
covering
wrapper
over
the
dresses
with
an
air
of
pride
and
confidence
which
was
remembered
long
afterwards
as
the
pride
that
goeth
before
a
fall
by
some
but
by
others
with
more
sympathy
who
guessed
the
secret
workings
of
the
mother
heart
chapter
viii
time
went
on
quickly
enough
amid
all
these
preparations
and
the
little
attendant
excitements
of
letters
congratulations
and
presents
which
came
in
on
every
side
elinor
complained
mildly
of
the
fuss
but
it
was
a
new
and
far
from
unpleasant
experience
she
liked
to
have
the
packets
brought
in
by
the
post
or
the
bigger
boxes
that
arrived
from
the
station
and
to
open
them
and
produce
out
of
the
wadding
or
the
one
pretty
thing
after
another
at
first
it
was
altogether
fresh
and
amusing
this
new
kind
of
existence
though
after
a
while
she
grew
as
may
be
supposed
lady
mariamne
present
she
was
a
little
ashamed
of
not
that
she
cared
much
but
because
of
the
look
on
her
mother
face
when
those
inferior
articles
were
unpacked
and
at
the
ring
which
old
lord
serf
sent
her
she
laughed
freely
i
will
put
it
with
my
own
little
old
baby
rings
in
this
little
silver
tray
and
they
will
all
look
as
if
they
were
antiques
or
something
worth
looking
at
said
elinor
happily
there
were
other
people
who
endowed
her
more
richly
with
rings
fit
for
a
bride
to
wear
the
relations
at
a
distance
were
more
or
less
pleased
with
prospects
a
few
indeed
from
different
parts
of
the
world
wrote
in
the
vein
of
elinor
hoping
that
it
was
not
the
compton
who
was
so
well
known
as
a
betting
man
whom
she
was
going
to
marry
but
the
fact
that
she
was
marrying
into
a
noble
family
and
would
henceforward
be
known
as
the
honourable
compton
mollified
even
these
critics
only
three
brothers
one
a
great
invalid
and
two
soldiers
between
him
and
the
title
elinor
relations
promptly
inaugurated
in
their
imaginations
a
great
war
in
which
two
noble
regiments
were
cut
to
pieces
to
dispose
of
the
two
captains
compton
and
as
for
the
invalid
that
he
would
obligingly
die
off
was
a
contingency
which
nobody
doubted
and
behold
elinor
dennistoun
lady
serf
this
greatly
calmed
criticism
among
her
relations
who
were
all
at
a
distance
and
whose
approval
or
disapproval
did
not
much
affect
her
spirits
anyhow
john
tatham
father
cousin
was
of
more
consequence
chiefly
as
being
john
father
but
also
a
little
for
himself
and
it
was
remarked
that
he
said
not
a
word
against
the
marriage
but
sent
a
very
handsome
present
and
many
congratulations
chiefly
inspired
but
this
elinor
did
not
divine
by
an
unfeigned
satisfaction
that
it
was
not
his
son
who
was
the
bridegroom
tatham
did
not
approve
of
early
marriages
for
young
men
pushing
their
way
at
the
bar
unless
the
bride
was
so
to
speak
in
the
profession
and
could
be
of
use
to
her
husband
even
in
such
cases
the
young
man
was
better
off
without
a
wife
he
was
of
opinion
how
could
he
get
up
his
cases
properly
if
he
had
to
drag
about
in
society
at
the
tail
of
a
gay
young
woman
therefore
he
sent
elinor
a
very
nice
present
in
gratitude
to
her
and
providence
she
was
a
danger
removed
out
of
his
boy
way
all
this
kept
a
cheerful
little
commotion
about
the
house
and
often
kept
the
mother
and
daughter
from
thinking
more
than
was
good
for
them
these
extraneous
matters
did
not
indeed
preserve
elinor
altogether
from
the
consciousness
that
her
letters
were
very
short
and
a
little
uncertain
in
their
arrival
sometimes
missing
several
days
together
and
generally
written
in
a
hurry
to
catch
the
post
but
they
kept
dennistoun
from
remarking
that
fact
as
otherwise
she
would
have
been
sure
to
do
if
any
chill
of
disappointment
was
in
mind
she
said
to
herself
that
men
were
generally
bad
correspondents
not
like
girls
who
had
nothing
else
to
do
and
other
consolations
of
this
kind
which
to
begin
with
beg
the
question
and
show
the
beginning
of
that
disenchantment
which
ought
to
be
reserved
at
least
for
a
later
period
elinor
had
already
given
up
a
good
deal
of
her
own
ideal
she
would
not
as
she
said
put
herself
in
competition
with
the
grouse
she
would
not
give
him
the
choice
between
her
and
a
cigar
but
already
the
consciousness
that
he
preferred
the
grouse
and
even
a
cigar
to
her
society
had
come
an
unwilling
intruder
into
elinor
mind
she
would
not
allow
to
herself
that
she
felt
it
in
either
case
she
said
to
herself
that
she
was
proud
of
it
that
it
showed
the
freedom
and
strength
of
a
man
and
that
love
was
only
one
of
many
things
which
occupied
his
life
she
rebelled
against
the
other
deduction
that
is
woman
sole
existence
protesting
loudly
to
herself
that
she
too
had
a
hundred
things
to
do
and
did
not
want
him
always
at
her
like
a
tame
curate
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
no
doubt
the
girl
would
have
been
flattered
and
happy
had
he
been
more
with
her
the
time
was
coming
very
quickly
in
which
they
should
be
together
always
even
when
there
was
grouse
in
hand
when
his
wife
would
be
invited
with
him
and
all
things
would
be
in
common
between
them
so
what
did
it
matter
for
a
few
days
the
marriage
was
fixed
for
the
of
september
and
that
great
date
was
now
scarcely
a
fortnight
off
the
excitement
quickened
as
everything
grew
towards
this
central
point
arrangements
had
to
be
made
about
the
wedding
breakfast
and
where
the
guests
were
to
be
placed
the
hudsons
had
put
their
spare
rooms
at
the
disposition
of
the
cottage
and
so
had
the
hills
the
bridegroom
was
to
stay
at
the
rectory
lady
mariamne
must
of
course
dennistoun
felt
be
put
up
at
the
cottage
where
the
two
rooms
on
the
ground
floor
what
were
called
the
gentlemen
rooms
had
to
be
prepared
to
receive
her
it
was
with
a
little
awe
indeed
that
the
ladies
of
the
cottage
endeavoured
by
the
aid
of
elinor
recollections
to
come
to
an
understanding
of
what
a
fine
lady
would
want
even
for
a
single
night
dennistoun
experiences
were
all
and
of
a
period
when
even
great
ladies
were
less
luxurious
than
now
and
it
made
her
a
little
angry
to
think
how
much
more
was
required
for
her
daughter
future
than
had
been
necessary
to
herself
but
after
all
what
had
herself
to
do
with
it
the
thing
was
to
do
elinor
credit
and
make
the
future
perceive
that
the
cottage
was
no
rustic
establishment
but
one
in
which
it
was
known
what
was
what
and
all
the
requirements
of
the
most
refined
life
elinor
bridesmaid
mary
tatham
was
to
have
the
spare
room
and
some
other
cousins
who
were
what
dennistoun
called
quiet
people
were
to
receive
the
hospitalities
of
the
hills
whose
house
was
roomy
and
thus
the
arrangements
of
the
crisis
were
more
or
less
settled
and
everything
made
smooth
elinor
and
her
mother
were
seated
together
in
the
on
one
of
those
evenings
of
which
dennistoun
desired
to
make
the
most
as
they
would
be
the
last
but
which
as
they
actually
passed
were
if
not
occupied
with
discussions
of
how
everything
was
to
be
arranged
which
they
went
over
again
and
again
by
instinct
as
a
safe
subject
heavy
almost
dull
and
dragged
sadly
over
the
poor
ladies
whose
hearts
were
so
full
but
to
whom
to
be
separated
though
it
would
be
bitter
would
also
at
the
same
time
almost
be
a
relief
they
had
been
silent
for
some
time
not
because
they
had
not
plenty
to
say
but
because
it
was
so
difficult
to
say
it
without
awaking
too
much
feeling
how
could
they
talk
of
the
future
in
which
one
of
them
would
be
away
in
strange
places
exposed
to
the
risks
and
vicissitudes
of
a
new
life
and
one
of
them
be
left
alone
in
the
unbroken
silence
sitting
over
the
fire
with
nothing
but
that
blaze
to
give
her
any
comfort
it
was
too
much
to
think
of
much
more
to
talk
about
though
it
need
not
be
said
that
it
was
in
the
minds
of
both
with
a
difference
for
elinor
imagination
was
most
employed
upon
the
brilliant
canvas
where
she
herself
held
necessarily
the
first
place
with
a
sketch
of
her
mother
lonely
life
giving
her
heart
a
pang
in
the
distance
while
dennistoun
could
not
help
but
see
the
lonely
figure
in
her
own
foreground
against
the
brightness
of
all
the
entertainments
in
which
elinor
should
appear
as
a
queen
they
were
sitting
thus
the
mother
employed
at
some
fine
needlework
for
the
daughter
the
daughter
doing
little
as
is
usual
nowadays
they
had
been
talking
over
lady
mariamne
and
her
requirements
again
and
had
come
to
an
end
of
that
subject
what
a
pity
that
it
was
so
hard
to
open
the
door
of
their
two
hearts
which
were
so
close
together
so
that
each
might
see
all
the
tenderness
and
compunction
in
the
other
the
shame
and
sorrow
of
the
mother
to
grudge
her
child
happiness
the
remorse
and
trouble
of
the
child
to
be
leaving
that
mother
out
in
all
her
calculations
for
the
future
how
were
they
to
do
it
on
either
side
they
could
not
talk
these
poor
loving
women
so
they
were
mostly
silent
saying
a
word
or
two
at
intervals
about
dennistoun
work
which
of
course
was
for
elinor
or
of
elinor
village
class
for
sewing
which
was
to
be
transferred
to
her
mother
skirting
the
edges
of
the
great
separation
which
could
neither
be
dismissed
nor
ignored
suddenly
elinor
looked
up
holding
up
her
finger
what
was
that
she
said
a
step
upon
the
gravel
nonsense
child
if
we
were
to
listen
to
all
these
noises
of
the
night
there
would
always
be
a
step
upon
oh
i
think
i
did
hear
something
it
is
someone
coming
to
the
door
said
elinor
rising
up
with
that
sudden
prevision
of
trouble
which
is
so
seldom
deceived
do
go
elinor
do
go
it
might
be
a
tramp
wait
at
least
till
they
knock
at
the
door
i
do
think
it
can
be
a
tramp
mamma
it
may
be
a
telegram
it
is
coming
straight
up
to
the
door
it
will
be
the
parcel
porter
from
the
station
he
is
always
coming
and
going
though
i
never
knew
him
so
late
pearson
is
in
the
house
you
know
there
is
not
any
cause
to
be
alarmed
alarmed
said
elinor
with
a
laugh
of
excitement
but
i
put
more
confidence
in
myself
than
in
pearson
whoever
it
may
be
she
stood
listening
with
a
face
full
of
expectation
and
dennistoun
put
down
her
work
and
listened
too
the
step
advanced
lightly
scattering
the
gravel
and
then
there
was
a
pause
as
if
the
stranger
had
stopped
to
reconnoitre
then
came
a
knock
at
the
window
which
could
only
have
been
done
by
a
tall
man
and
the
hearts
of
the
ladies
jumped
up
and
then
seemed
to
stop
beating
to
be
sure
there
were
bolts
and
bars
but
pearson
was
not
much
good
and
the
house
was
full
of
valuables
and
very
lonely
dennistoun
rose
up
trembling
a
little
and
went
forward
to
the
window
bidding
elinor
go
back
and
keep
quite
quiet
but
here
they
were
interrupted
by
a
voice
which
called
from
without
with
another
knock
on
the
window
nell
nell
it
is
phil
said
elinor
flying
to
the
door
dennistoun
sat
down
again
and
said
nothing
her
heart
sank
in
her
breast
she
did
not
know
what
she
feared
perhaps
that
he
had
come
to
break
off
the
marriage
perhaps
to
hurry
it
and
carry
her
child
away
there
was
a
pause
as
was
natural
at
the
door
a
murmur
of
voices
a
fond
confusion
of
words
which
made
it
clear
that
no
breach
was
likely
and
presently
after
that
interval
elinor
came
back
beaming
leading
her
lover
here
is
phil
she
said
in
such
liquid
tones
of
happiness
as
filled
her
mother
with
mingled
pleasure
gratitude
and
despite
he
has
found
he
had
a
day
or
two
to
spare
and
he
has
rushed
down
here
fancy
with
an
apology
for
not
letting
us
know
she
thinks
everyone
is
like
herself
dennistoun
but
i
am
aware
that
i
am
not
such
a
popular
personage
as
she
thinks
me
and
you
have
least
reason
of
all
to
approve
of
the
man
who
is
coming
to
carry
her
away
i
am
glad
to
see
you
compton
she
said
gravely
giving
him
her
hand
the
hon
philip
compton
was
a
very
tall
man
with
very
black
hair
he
had
fine
but
rather
features
a
large
nose
a
complexion
too
white
to
be
agreeable
though
it
added
to
his
romantic
appearance
there
was
a
furtive
look
in
his
big
dark
eyes
which
had
a
way
of
surveying
the
country
so
to
speak
before
making
a
reply
to
any
question
like
a
man
whose
response
depended
upon
what
he
saw
he
surveyed
dennistoun
in
this
way
while
she
spoke
but
then
he
took
her
hand
stooped
his
head
over
it
and
kissed
it
not
without
grace
thank
you
very
much
for
that
he
said
as
if
there
had
been
some
doubt
on
his
mind
about
his
reception
i
was
glad
enough
to
get
the
opportunity
i
can
tell
you
i
brought
you
some
birds
dennistoun
and
i
hope
you
give
me
some
supper
for
i
as
hungry
as
a
hawk
and
now
nell
let
have
a
look
at
you
the
lover
said
he
was
troubled
by
no
false
modesty
as
soon
as
he
had
paid
the
required
toll
of
courtesy
to
the
mother
who
naturally
ought
to
have
at
once
proceeded
to
give
orders
about
his
supper
he
held
elinor
at
arm
length
before
the
lamp
then
having
fully
inspected
her
appearance
and
expressed
by
a
charming
by
jove
his
opinion
of
it
proceeded
to
demonstrations
which
the
presence
of
the
mother
standing
by
did
not
moderate
there
are
few
mothers
to
whom
it
would
be
agreeable
to
see
their
child
engulfed
in
the
arms
of
a
large
and
strong
man
and
covered
with
his
bold
kisses
dennistoun
was
more
fastidious
even
than
most
mothers
and
to
her
this
embrace
was
a
sort
of
profanation
the
elinor
who
had
been
guarded
like
a
flower
from
every
contact
to
see
her
gripped
in
his
arms
by
this
stranger
made
her
mother
glow
with
an
indignation
which
she
knew
was
out
of
the
question
yet
felt
to
the
bottom
of
her
soul
elinor
was
abashed
before
her
mother
but
she
was
not
angry
she
forced
herself
from
his
embrace
but
her
blushing
countenance
was
full
of
happiness
what
a
revolution
had
thus
taken
place
in
a
few
minutes
they
had
been
so
dull
sitting
there
alone
alone
though
each
with
the
other
who
had
filled
her
life
for
more
than
twenty
years
and
now
all
was
lightened
palpitating
with
life
be
good
sir
said
elinor
pushing
him
into
a
chair
as
if
he
had
been
a
great
dog
and
quiet
and
and
then
you
shall
have
some
supper
but
tell
us
first
where
you
have
come
from
and
what
put
it
into
your
head
to
come
here
i
came
up
direct
from
my
brother
lomond
reply
no
what
put
it
into
my
head
to
come
love
i
suppose
and
the
bright
eyes
of
a
certain
little
witch
called
nell
i
ought
to
have
been
in
ireland
for
a
sort
of
a
farewell
visit
there
but
when
i
found
i
could
steal
two
days
you
may
imagine
i
knew
very
well
what
to
do
with
them
eh
oh
it
mamma
that
frightens
you
i
see
it
is
kind
of
you
to
give
elinor
two
days
when
you
have
so
many
other
engagements
said
dennistoun
turning
away
but
he
was
not
in
the
least
abashed
yes
is
it
he
said
my
last
few
days
of
freedom
i
consider
i
deserve
the
prize
for
virtue
to
cut
short
my
very
last
rampage
and
she
will
not
as
much
as
give
me
a
kiss
i
think
she
is
ashamed
before
you
mrs
dennistoun
it
would
not
be
surprising
if
she
were
said
dennistoun
gravely
i
am
as
you
may
perceive
oh
you
do
need
to
tell
me
that
said
he
one
can
see
it
with
half
an
eye
come
here
nell
you
little
coquette
or
i
shall
tell
the
jew
you
were
afraid
of
mamma
and
you
will
never
hear
an
end
of
it
as
long
as
you
live
elinor
i
think
you
had
better
see
perhaps
what
there
is
to
make
up
as
good
a
meal
as
possible
for
compton
said
her
mother
sitting
down
opposite
to
the
stranger
whose
long
limbs
were
stretched
over
half
the
floor
with
the
intention
of
tripping
up
elinor
it
seemed
but
she
glided
past
him
and
went
on
her
way
not
offended
oh
not
at
all
waving
her
hand
to
him
as
she
avoided
the
very
choice
joke
of
his
foot
compton
said
dennistoun
you
will
be
elinor
husband
in
less
than
a
fortnight
i
hope
so
he
said
displaying
the
large
cavern
of
a
yawn
under
his
black
moustache
as
he
looked
her
in
the
face
and
after
that
i
will
have
no
right
to
interfere
but
in
the
meantime
this
is
my
house
and
i
hope
you
will
remember
that
these
ways
are
not
mine
and
that
i
am
too
to
like
them
i
prefer
a
little
more
respect
to
your
betrothed
oh
respect
he
said
i
have
never
found
that
girls
like
too
much
respect
but
as
you
please
well
look
here
nell
he
said
catching
her
by
the
arm
as
she
came
back
and
swinging
her
towards
him
your
mother
thinks
i
too
rough
with
you
my
little
dear
do
you
mamma
said
elinor
faltering
a
little
but
she
had
the
sweetest
on
her
cheeks
and
the
moisture
of
joy
in
her
eyes
in
all
her
years
she
had
never
looked
as
she
looked
now
her
life
had
been
a
happy
one
but
not
like
this
she
had
been
always
beloved
and
never
had
known
for
a
day
what
it
was
to
be
neglected
yet
love
had
never
appeared
to
her
as
it
did
now
so
sweet
nor
life
so
beautiful
what
strange
delusion
what
a
wonderful
incomprehensible
mistake
or
so
at
least
the
mother
thought
looking
at
her
beautiful
girl
with
a
pang
at
her
heart
it
is
only
his
bad
manners
said
elinor
in
a
voice
which
sounded
like
a
caress
he
knows
very
well
how
to
behave
he
can
be
as
nice
as
any
one
and
as
pretty
spoken
and
careful
not
to
offend
it
is
only
arriving
so
suddenly
and
not
being
expected
or
that
he
has
forgotten
his
nice
manners
phil
do
you
hear
what
i
say
phil
made
himself
into
the
semblance
of
a
dog
and
sat
up
and
begged
for
pardon
it
was
a
trick
which
made
people
shriek
with
laughing
but
dennistoun
gravity
remained
unbroken
perhaps
her
extreme
seriousness
had
something
in
it
that
was
rather
ridiculous
too
it
was
a
relief
when
he
went
off
to
his
supper
attended
by
elinor
and
dennistoun
was
left
alone
over
her
fire
she
had
a
slight
sense
that
she
had
been
absurd
as
well
as
that
philip
compton
had
lacked
breeding
which
did
not
make
her
more
comfortable
was
it
possible
that
she
would
be
glad
when
it
was
all
over
and
her
child
gone
her
child
gone
and
with
that
man
her
child
her
little
delicately
bred
finely
nurtured
girl
who
had
been
wrapped
in
all
the
refinements
of
life
from
her
cradle
and
had
never
heard
a
rough
word
never
been
allowed
to
know
anything
that
would
disturb
her
virginal
calm
yet
now
in
a
moment
passed
away
beyond
her
mother
to
the
unceremonious
wooer
who
had
no
reverence
for
her
none
of
the
worship
her
mother
expected
how
strange
it
was
yet
a
thing
that
happened
every
day
dennistoun
sat
over
the
fire
though
it
was
not
cold
and
listened
to
the
voices
and
laughter
in
the
next
room
how
happy
they
were
to
be
together
she
did
not
however
dwell
upon
the
fact
that
she
was
alone
and
deserted
as
many
women
would
have
done
she
knew
that
she
would
have
plenty
of
time
to
dwell
on
this
in
the
lonely
days
to
come
what
occupied
her
was
the
want
of
more
than
manners
of
any
delicate
feeling
in
the
lover
who
had
seized
with
rude
caresses
upon
elinor
in
her
mother
presence
and
the
fact
that
elinor
did
not
object
nor
dislike
that
it
should
be
so
that
she
should
feel
forlorn
was
no
wonderful
thing
that
did
not
disturb
her
mind
it
was
the
other
matter
about
elinor
that
pained
and
horrified
her
she
could
not
tell
why
which
perhaps
was
fantastic
which
indeed
she
felt
sure
must
be
so
they
were
so
long
in
the
where
compton
had
his
supper
that
when
that
was
over
it
was
time
to
go
to
bed
still
talking
and
laughing
as
if
they
could
never
exhaust
either
the
fountain
of
talk
or
the
mirth
which
was
probably
much
more
sheer
pleasure
in
their
meeting
than
genuine
laughter
produced
by
any
wit
or
they
came
out
into
the
passage
and
stood
by
dennistoun
and
the
housemaid
who
had
brought
her
the
keys
and
was
now
fastening
the
hall
door
a
little
calendar
hung
on
the
wall
beneath
the
lamp
and
phil
compton
walked
up
to
it
and
with
a
laugh
read
out
the
date
sixth
september
he
said
and
turned
round
to
elinor
only
ten
days
more
nell
the
housemaid
stooping
down
over
the
bolt
blushed
and
laughed
too
under
her
breath
in
sympathy
but
dennistoun
turning
suddenly
round
caught
eye
why
had
he
given
that
keen
glance
about
him
there
was
nothing
to
call
for
his
usual
survey
of
the
company
in
that
sentiment
he
might
have
known
well
enough
what
were
the
feelings
he
was
likely
to
call
forth
a
keen
suspicion
shot
through
her
mind
suspicion
of
what
she
could
not
tell
there
was
nothing
that
was
not
most
natural
in
his
sudden
arrival
the
delightful
surprise
of
his
coming
his
certainty
of
a
good
reception
the
wonder
was
that
he
had
come
so
little
not
that
he
should
come
now
the
next
morning
the
visitor
made
himself
very
agreeable
his
raptures
were
a
little
calmed
he
talked
over
all
the
arrangements
and
entered
into
everything
with
the
interest
of
a
man
to
whom
that
great
day
approaching
was
indeed
the
greatest
day
in
his
life
and
it
turned
out
that
he
had
something
to
tell
which
was
of
practical
importance
i
may
relieve
your
mind
about
nell
money
he
said
for
i
believe
my
company
is
going
to
be
wound
up
we
look
out
for
another
investment
which
will
pay
as
well
and
be
less
risky
it
has
been
found
not
to
be
doing
quite
so
well
as
was
thought
so
we
going
to
wind
up
i
hope
you
have
not
lost
anything
said
dennistoun
oh
nothing
to
speak
of
he
said
carelessly
i
am
not
fond
of
speculative
companies
i
am
glad
you
are
done
with
it
dennistoun
said
and
i
glad
to
be
done
with
it
i
shall
look
out
for
something
permanent
and
decline
companies
i
thought
you
would
like
to
know
but
that
is
the
last
word
i
shall
say
about
business
come
nell
i
have
only
one
day
let
spend
it
in
the
woods
elinor
who
felt
that
the
day
in
the
woods
was
far
more
important
than
any
business
hurried
to
get
her
hat
and
follow
him
to
the
door
it
chanced
to
her
to
glance
at
the
calendar
as
she
passed
hastily
out
to
where
he
stood
awaiting
her
in
the
porch
why
that
should
have
happened
to
anyone
in
the
cottage
twice
in
the
hours
is
a
coincidence
which
i
can
not
explain
but
so
it
was
her
eye
caught
the
little
white
plaque
in
passing
and
perceived
with
surprise
that
it
had
moved
up
two
numbers
and
that
it
was
the
figure
which
was
marked
upon
it
now
we
can
not
have
slept
through
a
day
and
night
she
said
laughing
as
she
joined
him
the
calendar
says
the
eighth
september
now
but
i
arrived
on
the
sixth
he
said
mind
that
nell
whatever
happens
you
saw
it
with
your
own
eyes
it
may
be
of
consequence
to
remember
of
what
consequence
could
it
be
said
elinor
wondering
one
can
never
tell
the
only
thing
is
i
arrived
on
the
sixth
that
you
know
and
nell
my
darling
supposing
any
fellow
should
inquire
too
closely
into
my
movements
you
back
me
up
wo
you
and
agree
in
everything
i
say
who
should
inquire
into
your
movements
there
is
no
one
here
who
would
be
so
impertinent
phil
oh
he
said
there
is
never
any
telling
how
impertinent
people
may
be
and
what
is
there
in
your
movements
that
any
one
dare
inquire
about
i
hope
you
are
not
ashamed
of
coming
to
see
me
that
is
just
what
is
the
saving
of
me
nell
i
ca
explain
what
i
mean
now
but
i
will
later
on
only
mind
you
do
contradict
me
if
we
should
meet
any
inquisitive
person
i
arrived
on
the
sixth
and
back
me
like
my
true
love
in
everything
i
say
as
far
as
as
i
know
phil
oh
we
must
have
no
conditions
you
must
stand
by
me
in
everything
i
say
chapter
ix
this
day
in
the
copse
was
one
that
elinor
never
forgot
at
the
moment
it
seemed
to
her
the
most
blissful
period
of
all
her
life
there
had
been
times
in
which
she
had
longed
that
phil
knew
more
and
cared
more
for
the
objects
which
had
always
been
most
familiar
and
told
for
most
in
her
own
existence
although
it
is
true
that
at
first
his
very
ignorance
real
or
assumed
his
careless
way
of
treating
all
intellectual
subjects
his
indifference
to
books
and
pictures
and
even
nature
had
amused
and
pleased
her
giving
a
piquancy
to
the
physical
strength
and
enjoying
manhood
the
perpetual
activity
and
state
of
doing
something
in
which
he
was
it
was
not
a
kind
of
life
which
she
had
ever
known
before
and
it
dazzled
her
with
its
apparent
freedom
and
fulness
the
variety
in
it
the
constant
movement
the
crowd
of
occupations
and
people
to
her
who
had
been
used
to
finding
a
great
deal
of
her
amusement
in
reading
in
sketching
not
very
well
in
playing
tunes
and
generally
practising
with
very
moderate
success
arts
for
which
she
had
no
individual
enthusiasm
it
had
seemed
like
a
new
life
to
be
plunged
into
the
society
of
horses
and
dogs
into
the
active
world
which
was
made
up
of
a
round
of
amusements
race
meetings
days
on
the
river
follies
of
every
conceivable
kind
exercise
and
air
and
movement
the
ignorance
of
all
these
people
dazzled
her
as
if
it
had
been
a
new
science
it
had
seemed
something
wonderful
and
piquant
to
elinor
to
find
people
who
knew
so
much
of
subjects
she
had
never
heard
of
and
nothing
at
all
of
those
she
had
been
trained
to
know
and
then
there
had
come
a
moment
when
she
had
begun
to
sigh
under
her
breath
as
it
were
and
wish
that
phil
would
sometimes
open
a
book
that
when
he
took
up
the
newspaper
he
would
look
at
something
more
than
the
sporting
news
and
the
bits
of
gossip
that
he
would
talk
now
and
then
of
something
different
from
the
racings
and
the
startings
and
the
odds
and
the
scrapes
other
men
got
into
and
the
astonishing
frocks
of
the
jew
those
things
so
wonderful
at
first
like
a
new
language
absurd
yet
amusing
came
to
be
a
little
tiresome
especially
when
scraps
of
them
made
up
the
bulk
of
the
very
brief
letters
which
phil
scribbled
to
his
betrothed
but
during
this
day
after
his
unexpected
arrival
the
joy
of
seeing
him
suddenly
the
pleasure
of
feeling
that
he
had
broken
through
all
his
engagements
to
come
to
her
and
the
fervour
of
his
satisfaction
in
being
with
her
again
that
very
fervour
which
shocked
her
mother
elinor
first
glow
of
delight
in
her
love
came
fully
back
and
as
they
wandered
through
the
pleasant
paths
of
the
copse
his
very
talk
seemed
somehow
changed
and
to
have
gained
just
that
little
mingling
of
perception
of
her
tastes
and
wishes
which
she
had
desired
there
was
a
little
autumnal
mist
about
the
softening
haze
which
was
not
decay
but
only
the
mellow
fruitfulness
of
the
poet
and
the
day
notwithstanding
this
was
as
warm
as
june
the
sky
blue
with
only
a
little
white
puff
of
cloud
here
and
there
phil
paused
to
look
down
the
combe
with
all
the
folds
of
the
downs
that
wrapped
it
about
going
off
in
blue
outlines
into
the
distance
and
said
it
was
a
jolly
view
which
amused
elinor
more
than
if
he
had
used
the
finest
language
and
showed
that
he
was
beginning
she
thought
to
care
a
little
for
the
things
which
pleased
her
and
i
suppose
you
could
see
a
man
coming
by
that
bit
of
road
yes
said
elinor
you
could
see
a
man
coming
or
going
but
unless
you
were
to
make
believe
very
strong
like
the
marchioness
you
could
not
make
out
who
the
man
was
what
marchioness
said
phil
i
did
know
you
had
anybody
with
a
title
about
here
i
say
nell
it
a
very
jolly
view
but
hideously
dull
for
you
my
pet
to
have
lived
so
long
here
i
never
found
it
in
the
least
dull
she
said
why
there
is
nothing
to
do
i
suppose
you
read
books
eh
that
what
you
call
amusing
yourself
you
ought
to
have
made
the
old
lady
take
you
about
a
deal
abroad
and
all
over
the
place
but
i
expect
you
have
never
stood
up
for
yourself
a
bit
nell
do
call
mamma
the
old
lady
phil
she
is
not
old
and
far
prettier
than
most
people
i
know
well
she
should
have
done
it
for
herself
might
have
picked
up
a
good
match
eh
a
that
would
have
left
you
a
pot
of
money
you
do
mean
to
say
you
would
have
liked
that
oh
phil
phil
i
wish
you
could
understand
well
well
i
let
the
old
girl
alone
and
then
came
the
point
at
which
phil
improved
so
much
tell
me
what
you
been
reading
last
he
said
i
should
like
to
know
what
you
are
thinking
about
even
if
i
do
understand
it
myself
i
say
nell
who
do
you
think
that
can
be
dashing
so
fast
along
the
road
it
is
the
people
at
reddown
she
said
i
know
their
white
horses
they
always
dash
along
as
if
they
were
in
the
greatest
hurry
do
you
really
want
to
know
what
i
have
been
reading
phil
though
it
is
very
little
i
fear
because
of
the
dressmakers
and
all
the
other
things
you
see
he
said
when
you
have
lots
to
do
you
ca
keep
up
with
your
books
which
is
the
reason
why
i
never
pretend
to
read
i
have
no
time
you
might
find
a
little
time
i
have
seen
you
look
very
much
bored
and
complain
that
there
was
nothing
to
do
never
when
you
were
there
nell
that
i
answer
for
but
of
course
there
are
times
when
a
fellow
is
doing
anything
much
what
would
you
have
me
read
there
always
the
and
you
know
the
and
a
few
more
oh
phil
you
do
call
them
literature
i
hope
i
do
know
much
about
what
you
call
literature
there
ruff
and
hoyle
and
i
say
nell
there
a
going
a
pace
who
can
that
be
do
you
suppose
i
do
know
all
the
about
i
should
think
it
was
some
one
coming
from
the
station
oh
he
said
and
made
a
long
pause
driving
like
that
if
they
break
their
necks
they
should
be
here
in
ten
minutes
or
so
oh
not
for
twice
that
time
the
road
makes
such
a
round
but
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
any
from
the
station
should
be
coming
here
well
to
return
to
the
literature
as
you
call
it
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
get
a
lot
of
books
for
you
to
keep
you
amused
eh
nell
even
in
the
honeymoon
we
shall
not
have
time
to
read
very
much
if
we
are
moving
about
all
the
time
not
me
but
you
i
know
what
you
do
you
go
and
leave
me
planted
and
run
to
read
your
book
i
seen
the
jew
do
it
with
some
of
her
confounded
novels
that
she
always
wanting
to
turn
over
to
me
but
there
are
some
novels
that
you
would
like
to
read
phil
not
a
bit
why
nell
i
know
far
better
stories
of
fellows
in
our
own
set
than
any
novel
these
writing
men
ever
can
put
on
paper
fellows
and
women
too
stories
that
would
make
your
hair
stand
on
end
and
that
would
make
you
die
with
laughing
you
ca
think
what
lots
i
know
that
cart
would
have
been
here
by
this
time
if
it
had
been
coming
here
eh
oh
no
not
yet
the
road
makes
such
a
long
round
do
you
expect
any
one
phil
i
do
quite
know
there
something
on
at
that
confounded
office
of
ours
everything
you
know
has
gone
to
smash
i
did
think
it
well
to
say
too
much
to
the
old
lady
last
night
there
been
a
regular
row
and
the
manager
absconded
and
all
turns
on
whether
they
can
find
some
books
i
should
wonder
if
one
of
the
fellows
came
down
here
if
they
find
out
where
i
am
i
say
nell
mind
you
back
me
up
whatever
i
say
but
i
ca
possibly
know
anything
about
it
said
elinor
astonished
never
mind
about
dates
and
that
if
you
do
stand
by
me
there
may
be
a
fuss
and
the
wedding
delayed
remember
that
my
pet
the
wedding
delayed
that
what
i
want
to
avoid
now
come
nell
let
have
another
go
about
the
books
all
english
mind
you
i
wo
buy
you
any
of
the
french
rot
they
too
spicy
for
a
little
girl
like
you
i
do
know
what
you
mean
phil
i
hope
you
do
think
that
i
read
nothing
but
novels
elinor
said
nothing
but
novels
oh
if
you
go
in
for
mathematics
and
that
sort
of
thing
nell
the
novels
are
too
deep
for
me
do
say
poetry
if
you
love
me
i
could
stand
most
things
from
you
nell
you
little
darling
but
nell
if
you
come
spouting
verses
all
the
time
his
look
of
horror
made
elinor
laugh
you
need
not
be
afraid
i
never
spout
verses
she
said
come
along
this
way
a
little
where
we
can
see
the
road
all
women
seem
to
like
poetry
there
a
few
fellows
i
do
mind
myself
ingoldsby
now
that
something
fine
we
had
him
at
school
and
perhaps
it
was
the
contrast
from
one
lessons
do
you
know
ingoldsby
nell
a
little
i
have
read
some
ah
you
like
the
sentimental
best
there
whyte
melville
then
there
always
something
melancholy
about
him
the
old
horse
died
and
that
sort
of
thing
makes
you
cry
do
you
know
you
all
like
that
certainly
if
that
had
been
coming
here
it
must
have
come
by
this
time
yes
it
must
have
come
elinor
admitted
with
a
little
wonder
at
the
importance
which
he
gave
to
this
possible
incident
but
there
is
another
train
at
two
if
you
are
very
anxious
to
see
this
man
oh
i
not
anxious
to
see
him
said
compton
with
a
laugh
but
probably
he
will
want
to
see
me
no
nell
you
will
not
expect
me
to
read
poetry
to
you
while
we
away
there
quite
a
library
at
place
you
can
amuse
yourself
there
when
i
shooting
not
that
i
shall
shoot
much
or
anything
that
takes
me
away
from
my
nell
but
you
must
come
out
with
us
there
is
no
such
fun
as
stumping
over
the
moors
the
jew
has
got
all
the
for
that
sort
of
thing
short
frocks
and
knickerbockers
and
a
duck
of
a
little
she
thinks
she
a
great
shot
poor
thing
and
men
are
civil
and
let
her
imagine
that
knocked
over
a
pheasant
or
a
hare
now
and
then
as
for
the
partridges
she
lets
fly
of
course
but
to
say
she
hits
anything
i
should
not
want
to
hit
anything
said
elinor
oh
please
phil
i
will
try
anything
else
you
like
but
do
make
me
shoot
you
little
humbug
see
what
you
say
when
you
get
quite
clear
of
the
old
lady
but
i
do
want
you
to
shoot
nell
if
you
do
get
tired
sitting
at
home
with
all
of
us
out
on
the
hill
i
like
to
come
in
for
my
part
and
find
a
little
duck
all
tidy
not
blowzy
and
blown
about
by
the
wind
like
the
jew
with
her
ridiculous
bag
that
all
the
fellows
snigger
at
behind
her
back
you
should
not
let
any
fellow
laugh
at
your
sister
phil
oh
as
for
that
they
are
all
as
thick
with
her
as
i
am
and
why
should
i
interfere
but
i
promise
you
nobody
shall
cut
a
joke
upon
my
nell
i
should
hope
not
indeed
said
elinor
indignant
but
as
for
your
phil
as
you
call
them
you
must
be
angry
with
me
but
i
do
much
like
those
gentlemen
they
are
a
little
rude
and
rough
they
shall
not
call
me
by
my
christian
name
or
anything
but
my
own
formal
compton
he
said
seizing
her
in
his
arms
you
little
duck
they
be
as
frightened
of
you
as
if
you
were
fifty
but
you
spoil
good
company
nell
i
shall
like
you
to
keep
them
at
a
distance
but
you
must
go
too
far
and
above
all
my
pet
you
must
put
out
the
jew
i
calculate
on
being
a
lot
there
they
have
a
nice
house
and
a
good
table
and
all
that
and
prestwich
is
glad
of
somebody
to
help
about
his
horses
you
must
set
up
any
of
your
airs
with
the
jew
i
do
know
what
you
mean
by
my
airs
phil
oh
but
i
do
and
they
delicious
nell
half
like
a
little
girl
and
half
like
a
queen
but
it
will
never
do
to
make
the
jew
feel
small
in
her
own
set
hallo
there
some
one
tumbling
alone
over
the
stones
on
that
precious
road
of
yours
i
believe
it
that
cart
from
the
station
after
all
no
said
elinor
it
is
only
one
of
the
tradespeople
you
certainly
are
anxious
about
those
carts
from
the
station
phil
not
a
bit
he
said
and
then
after
a
moment
he
added
yes
on
the
whole
i
much
rather
the
man
came
if
he
coming
while
i
here
and
while
you
are
with
me
nell
for
i
want
you
to
stick
to
me
and
back
me
up
they
might
think
i
ought
to
go
after
that
manager
fellow
and
spoil
the
wedding
therefore
mind
you
back
me
up
i
ca
think
dear
phil
what
there
is
for
me
to
do
i
know
nothing
about
the
business
nor
what
has
happened
you
never
told
me
anything
and
how
can
i
back
you
up
about
things
i
do
know
oh
yes
you
can
he
said
you
soon
see
if
the
fellow
comes
just
you
stand
by
me
whatever
i
say
you
may
know
or
even
i
may
seem
to
make
a
mistake
but
you
know
me
if
you
do
know
the
circumstances
and
i
hope
you
can
trust
me
nell
that
it
will
be
all
right
but
said
elinor
confused
do
go
on
with
your
buts
there
a
darling
do
contradict
me
there
is
nothing
looks
so
silly
to
strangers
as
a
woman
contradicting
every
word
a
fellow
says
i
only
want
you
to
stand
by
me
do
you
know
that
all
and
i
tell
you
everything
about
it
after
when
there
time
tell
me
about
it
now
said
elinor
you
may
be
sure
i
shall
be
interested
there
plenty
of
time
now
talk
about
business
to
you
when
i
only
a
single
day
and
not
half
time
enough
you
little
duck
to
tell
you
what
a
darling
you
are
and
how
i
count
every
hour
till
i
can
have
you
all
to
myself
ah
nell
nell
if
that
day
were
only
here
and
then
phil
turned
to
those
subjects
and
those
methods
which
cast
so
much
confusion
into
the
mind
of
dennistoun
when
practised
under
her
sedate
and
eyes
but
elinor
as
has
been
said
did
not
take
exactly
the
same
view
presently
they
went
to
luncheon
and
phil
secured
himself
a
place
at
table
commanding
the
road
i
never
knew
before
how
jolly
it
was
he
said
though
everything
is
jolly
here
and
that
peep
of
the
road
must
give
you
warning
when
any
invasion
is
coming
it
is
too
far
off
for
that
said
dennistoun
oh
no
not
for
sharp
eyes
nell
there
told
me
who
several
people
were
those
white
horses
the
people
at
where
did
you
say
nell
reddown
mamma
the
philistines
as
you
call
them
that
are
always
dashing
about
the
country
with
the
finest
horses
in
the
county
i
like
the
for
that
said
phil
he
did
not
go
wrong
in
his
french
which
was
a
great
consolation
to
elinor
they
like
to
have
the
best
of
everything
your
poor
swell
has
to
take
what
he
can
get
but
the
the
man
in
these
days
and
then
there
was
a
which
she
pronounced
to
be
from
the
station
but
which
turned
out
to
be
the
butcher
or
the
baker
or
the
maker
it
is
really
too
far
off
to
make
sure
of
anything
except
white
horses
ah
there
no
mistaking
them
i
see
something
sweeping
along
but
that
a
country
wagon
i
suppose
it
gives
me
a
great
deal
of
diversion
to
see
the
people
on
the
road
which
perhaps
you
will
think
a
vulgar
amusement
not
at
all
said
dennistoun
politely
but
she
thought
within
herself
how
empty
the
brain
must
be
which
sought
diversion
from
the
distant
carriages
passing
two
miles
off
to
be
sure
across
the
combe
as
the
crow
flies
it
was
not
a
quarter
part
so
far
as
that
phil
thinks
some
one
may
possibly
come
to
him
on
business
to
explain
things
said
elinor
anxious
on
her
part
to
make
it
clear
that
it
was
not
out
of
mere
vacancy
that
her
lover
had
watched
so
closely
the
carriages
on
the
road
unfortunately
there
is
something
like
a
smash
he
said
they
keep
it
out
of
the
papers
if
they
can
but
you
may
see
it
in
the
papers
the
manager
has
run
away
and
there
a
question
about
some
books
i
suppose
you
would
understand
they
may
come
to
me
here
about
it
or
they
may
wait
till
i
go
back
to
town
i
thought
you
were
going
to
ireland
phil
so
i
shall
probably
just
for
three
days
to
fill
up
the
time
one
wants
to
be
doing
something
to
keep
one
self
down
you
ca
keep
quiet
and
behave
yourself
when
you
are
going
to
be
married
in
a
week
unless
you
a
little
chit
of
a
girl
without
any
feelings
he
said
with
a
laugh
and
elinor
laughed
too
while
dennistoun
sat
as
grave
as
a
judge
at
the
head
of
the
table
but
phil
was
not
daunted
by
her
serious
face
so
long
as
the
road
was
quite
clear
he
had
all
the
appearance
of
a
perfectly
easy
mind
we
have
been
talking
about
literature
he
said
i
am
a
stupid
fellow
as
perhaps
you
know
for
that
sort
of
thing
but
nell
is
to
indoctrinate
me
we
mean
to
take
a
big
box
of
books
and
i
to
be
made
to
read
poetry
and
all
sorts
of
fine
things
in
my
honeymoon
that
is
a
new
idea
said
dennistoun
i
thought
elinor
meant
to
give
up
reading
on
the
other
hand
to
make
things
square
there
was
a
little
breath
of
a
protest
from
elinor
oh
mamma
but
she
left
the
talk
he
could
do
it
so
much
better
in
compton
hand
i
expect
to
figure
as
a
sort
of
prodigy
in
my
family
he
said
not
bookish
the
jew
goes
in
for
french
novels
but
i
do
intend
to
let
nell
touch
them
so
you
may
be
easy
in
your
mind
i
have
no
doubt
lady
mariamne
makes
a
good
selection
said
dennistoun
not
she
she
reads
whatever
comes
and
the
more
salt
the
better
the
jew
is
quite
an
emancipated
person
do
you
think
she
bore
you
rather
in
this
little
house
she
carries
bales
of
rubbish
with
her
wherever
she
goes
and
her
maid
and
her
dog
and
i
do
know
what
if
i
were
you
i
write
or
better
wire
and
tell
her
there
a
capital
train
from
victoria
will
bring
her
here
in
time
for
the
wedding
and
that
it
a
thousand
pities
she
should
disturb
herself
to
come
for
the
night
if
your
sister
can
put
up
with
my
small
accommodation
i
shall
of
course
be
happy
to
have
her
whatever
she
brings
with
her
dennistoun
said
oh
it
not
a
question
of
putting
up
she
be
delighted
i
sure
but
i
think
you
find
her
a
great
bore
she
is
exceedingly
fussy
when
she
has
not
all
her
things
about
her
however
you
must
judge
for
yourself
but
if
you
think
better
of
it
wire
a
few
words
and
it
be
all
right
i
to
go
to
the
old
rectory
nell
says
it
is
not
a
particularly
old
rectory
it
is
a
very
nice
pleasant
house
i
think
you
will
find
yourself
quite
comfortable
you
and
the
gentleman
dick
bolsover
who
is
going
to
see
me
through
it
and
i
daresay
i
should
not
sleep
much
if
i
were
in
the
most
luxurious
bed
in
the
world
they
say
a
man
who
is
going
to
be
hanged
sleeps
like
a
top
but
i
think
i
shall
what
do
you
say
nell
elinor
i
should
think
could
have
no
opinion
on
the
subject
said
dennistoun
pale
with
anger
you
will
all
dine
here
of
course
some
other
friends
are
coming
and
a
cousin
tatham
of
cross
is
that
said
phil
the
cousin
john
john
i
am
sorry
to
say
is
abroad
the
long
vacation
is
the
worst
time
it
is
his
father
who
is
coming
and
his
sister
mary
tatham
who
is
elinor
bridesmaid
she
and
miss
hudson
at
the
rectory
only
two
and
very
sensible
instead
of
the
train
one
sees
all
thinking
how
best
to
show
themselves
off
dick
bolsover
is
man
enough
to
tackle
them
both
he
expects
some
fun
i
can
tell
you
what
is
there
to
be
after
we
are
gone
nell
he
stopped
and
looked
round
with
a
laugh
rather
close
quarters
for
a
ball
he
said
there
will
be
no
ball
you
forget
that
when
you
take
elinor
away
i
shall
be
alone
a
solitary
woman
living
in
a
cottage
as
you
remark
does
not
give
balls
i
am
much
afraid
that
there
will
be
very
little
fun
for
your
friend
oh
he
amuse
himself
well
enough
he
the
sort
of
fellow
who
always
makes
himself
at
home
a
rectory
will
be
great
fun
for
him
i
suppose
he
was
ever
in
one
before
unless
perhaps
when
he
was
a
boy
at
school
yes
as
you
say
what
a
lot
of
trouble
it
will
be
for
you
to
be
sure
not
as
if
nell
had
a
sister
to
enjoy
the
fun
after
it
a
thousand
pities
you
did
not
decide
to
bring
her
up
to
town
and
get
us
shuffled
off
there
you
might
have
got
a
little
house
for
next
to
nothing
at
this
time
of
the
year
and
saved
all
the
row
turning
everything
upside
down
in
this
nice
little
place
and
troubling
yourself
with
visitors
and
so
forth
but
one
always
thinks
of
that
sort
of
thing
too
late
i
should
not
have
adopted
such
an
expedient
in
any
case
elinor
must
be
married
among
her
own
people
wherever
her
lot
may
be
cast
afterwards
everybody
here
has
known
her
ever
since
she
was
born
ah
that
a
thing
ladies
think
of
i
suppose
said
compton
he
had
stuck
his
glass
into
his
eye
and
was
gazing
out
of
the
window
very
jolly
view
he
continued
and
what
that
nell
raising
clouds
of
dust
i
have
such
quick
eyes
as
you
i
should
think
it
must
be
a
circus
or
a
menagerie
or
something
mamma
very
likely
said
dennistoun
they
sometimes
come
this
way
on
the
road
to
portsmouth
and
give
little
representations
in
all
the
villages
to
the
great
excitement
of
the
country
folk
we
are
the
country
folk
and
i
feel
quite
excited
said
phil
dropping
his
glass
nell
if
there
a
representation
you
and
i
will
go
oh
phil
what
elinor
was
about
to
say
folly
but
she
paused
seeing
a
look
in
his
eye
which
she
had
already
learned
to
know
and
added
fun
in
a
voice
which
sounded
almost
like
an
echo
of
his
own
there
is
nothing
like
being
out
in
the
wilderness
like
this
to
make
one
relish
a
little
fun
eh
i
daresay
you
always
go
the
jew
is
the
one
for
every
village
fair
within
ten
miles
when
she
is
in
the
country
she
says
they
better
than
any
play
hallo
what
is
that
it
is
some
one
coming
round
the
gravel
path
a
more
simple
statement
could
not
be
but
it
made
compton
strangely
uneasy
he
rose
up
hastily
from
the
table
it
is
perhaps
the
man
i
am
looking
for
if
you
permit
me
i
go
and
see
he
went
out
of
the
room
calling
elinor
by
a
look
and
slight
movement
of
his
head
but
when
he
came
out
into
the
hall
was
met
by
a
trim
clerical
figure
and
genial
countenance
the
benign
yet
looks
of
the
rector
of
the
parish
none
other
could
this
smiling
yet
important
personage
be
chapter
x
the
rector
came
in
with
his
smiling
and
rosy
face
he
was
as
many
of
his
parishioners
thought
a
picture
of
a
country
clergyman
such
a
healthy
colour
as
clear
as
a
girl
limpid
blue
eyes
with
very
light
eyelashes
and
eyebrows
a
nice
round
face
beautifully
modelled
according
to
miss
sarah
hill
who
did
a
little
in
that
way
herself
and
knew
how
to
approve
of
a
higher
sculptor
work
and
then
the
neatest
and
blackest
of
coats
and
the
whitest
and
stiffest
of
collars
hudson
i
need
scarcely
say
was
not
so
left
to
himself
as
to
permit
his
clerical
character
to
be
divined
by
means
of
a
white
tie
he
came
in
as
was
natural
among
country
neighbours
without
thinking
of
any
bell
or
knocker
on
the
easily
opened
door
and
was
about
to
peep
into
the
with
anybody
in
upon
his
smiling
lips
when
he
saw
a
gentleman
approaching
picking
up
his
hat
as
he
advanced
hudson
paused
a
moment
in
uncertainty
compton
i
am
sure
he
said
holding
out
both
of
his
plump
pink
hands
ah
elinor
too
i
was
sure
i
could
not
be
mistaken
and
i
am
exceedingly
glad
to
make
your
acquaintance
he
shook
phil
hand
up
and
down
in
a
sort
of
very
glad
to
make
your
acquaintance
though
you
are
the
worst
enemy
windyhill
has
had
for
many
a
day
carrying
off
the
finest
lamb
in
all
the
fold
yes
i
a
wolf
i
suppose
said
phil
he
went
to
the
door
and
took
a
long
look
out
while
elinor
led
the
rector
into
the
then
compton
lounged
in
after
them
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
placed
himself
in
the
where
he
could
still
see
the
white
line
across
the
combe
of
the
distant
road
they
think
i
have
stolen
a
march
upon
them
all
elinor
said
the
rector
chancing
upon
compton
like
this
a
quite
unexpected
pleasure
i
shall
keep
them
on
the
tenterhooks
asking
them
whom
they
suppose
i
have
met
and
they
will
give
everybody
but
the
right
person
what
a
thing
for
me
to
have
been
the
first
person
to
see
your
intended
my
dear
and
i
congratulate
you
elinor
said
the
rector
dropping
his
voice
a
fine
handsome
fellow
and
such
an
air
you
are
a
lucky
girl
he
paused
a
little
and
said
with
a
slight
hesitation
in
a
whisper
so
far
as
meets
the
eye
oh
hudson
do
spoil
everything
said
elinor
in
the
same
tone
well
i
can
not
tell
can
i
my
dear
the
first
peep
i
have
had
he
cleaved
his
throat
and
raised
his
voice
i
believe
we
are
to
have
the
pleasure
of
entertaining
you
compton
on
a
certain
joyful
occasion
joyful
to
you
not
to
us
i
need
not
say
how
pleased
my
wife
and
i
and
the
other
members
of
the
family
will
be
there
are
not
very
many
of
us
we
are
only
five
in
number
my
son
and
my
daughter
and
miss
dale
my
wife
sister
but
much
younger
than
hudson
who
has
done
us
the
pleasure
of
staying
with
us
for
part
of
the
year
i
think
she
has
met
you
somewhere
or
knows
some
of
your
family
or
something
she
is
a
great
authority
on
noble
families
i
do
know
whether
it
is
because
she
has
been
a
good
deal
in
society
or
whether
it
is
out
of
debrett
nell
come
and
tell
me
what
this
is
compton
said
oh
phil
it
is
nothing
it
is
a
carriage
i
do
know
what
it
is
be
civil
to
the
rector
please
so
i
am
perfectly
civil
you
have
not
answered
a
single
word
and
he
has
been
talking
to
you
for
ten
minutes
well
but
he
has
said
anything
that
i
can
answer
he
says
miss
something
or
other
knows
my
family
perhaps
she
does
well
much
good
may
it
do
her
but
what
can
i
say
to
that
i
am
sure
i
do
know
hers
i
did
come
here
to
be
talked
to
by
the
rector
could
we
slip
out
and
leave
him
with
your
mother
that
would
suit
his
book
a
great
deal
better
come
let
go
oh
he
is
speaking
to
you
phil
compton
turned
round
and
eyed
the
rector
yes
he
said
in
so
marked
an
interrogative
that
hudson
stopped
short
and
flushed
he
had
been
talking
for
some
time
oh
i
was
not
precisely
asking
a
question
he
said
in
his
quiet
tones
i
was
saying
that
we
believe
and
hope
that
another
gentleman
is
coming
with
you
for
the
occasion
dick
bolsover
said
compton
a
son
of
lord
freshfield
perhaps
miss
the
lady
you
were
talking
of
may
know
his
family
too
his
brother
got
a
little
talked
of
in
that
affair
about
fille
do
you
know
at
newmarket
but
dick
is
a
rattling
good
fellow
does
race
and
has
no
vices
he
is
coming
to
stand
by
me
and
see
that
all
right
we
shall
be
happy
to
see
bolsover
i
am
sure
the
rector
rubbed
his
hands
and
said
to
himself
with
pleasure
that
two
honourables
in
his
quiet
house
was
something
to
think
of
and
that
he
hoped
it
would
not
turn
the
heads
of
the
ladies
and
make
alice
expect
one
could
tell
what
and
then
he
said
by
way
of
changing
yet
continuing
the
subject
i
suppose
you
been
looking
at
the
presents
elinor
must
have
shown
you
her
presents
by
jove
i
never
thought
of
the
presents
have
you
got
a
lot
nell
she
has
got
if
i
may
be
allowed
to
answer
for
her
having
known
her
all
her
life
a
great
many
pretty
things
compton
we
are
not
rich
to
be
sure
her
old
friends
here
we
have
to
content
ourselves
with
but
a
small
token
of
a
great
deal
of
affection
but
still
there
are
a
number
of
pretty
things
elinor
what
were
you
thinking
of
my
dear
not
to
show
compton
the
little
set
out
which
you
showed
us
come
i
should
myself
like
to
look
them
over
again
phil
gave
another
long
look
at
the
distant
road
and
then
he
thrust
his
arm
into
elinor
and
said
to
be
sure
come
along
nell
it
will
be
something
to
do
he
did
not
wait
for
the
rector
to
pass
first
which
elinor
thought
would
have
been
better
manners
but
thrust
her
before
him
quite
regardless
of
the
older
people
let
see
the
trumpery
he
said
do
use
such
a
word
phil
the
rector
will
be
so
hurt
oh
will
he
did
he
work
you
an
antimacassar
or
something
phil
speak
low
at
least
no
but
his
daughter
did
and
they
gave
me
i
know
a
cardcase
or
a
or
something
and
how
many
have
you
got
and
clocks
and
that
sort
of
thing
i
advise
you
to
have
an
auction
as
soon
as
we
get
away
hallo
that
a
nice
little
thing
look
pretty
on
your
pretty
white
neck
i
should
say
nell
who
gave
you
that
he
took
john
necklace
out
of
its
box
where
it
had
lain
undisturbed
until
now
and
pulled
it
through
his
fingers
cost
a
pretty
bit
of
money
that
i
should
say
you
can
raise
the
wind
on
it
when
we
down
on
our
luck
nell
my
cousin
john
whom
you
have
heard
me
speak
of
gave
me
that
phil
said
elinor
with
great
gravity
she
thought
it
necessary
she
could
scarcely
tell
why
to
make
a
stand
for
her
cousin
john
ah
i
thought
it
was
one
of
the
disappointed
ones
said
phil
flinging
it
back
carelessly
onto
the
bed
of
white
velvet
where
it
had
been
fitted
so
exactly
that
how
they
show
their
spite
for
of
course
i
give
you
anything
half
as
good
as
that
there
was
no
disappointment
in
the
matter
said
elinor
almost
angry
with
the
misconceptions
of
her
lover
you
are
a
nice
one
said
compton
taking
her
by
the
chin
to
tell
me
as
if
i
did
know
the
world
a
long
sight
better
than
you
do
my
little
nell
the
rector
who
was
following
slowly
for
he
did
not
like
to
go
in
a
hurry
saw
this
attitude
and
drew
back
a
little
scandalized
perhaps
we
were
indiscreet
to
to
follow
them
too
closely
he
said
disconcerted
please
to
go
in
first
dennistoun
the
young
couple
will
not
mind
you
hudson
was
prim
but
he
was
rather
pleased
to
see
that
the
young
couple
were
as
he
said
so
fond
of
each
other
he
went
into
the
room
under
the
protection
of
the
mother
blushing
a
little
it
reminded
him
as
he
said
afterwards
of
his
own
young
days
but
it
was
only
natural
that
he
should
walk
up
direct
to
the
place
where
his
kettle
stood
conspicuous
waiting
only
the
spark
of
a
match
to
begin
to
boil
the
water
for
the
first
conjugal
tea
it
appeared
to
him
a
beautiful
idea
as
he
put
his
head
on
one
side
and
looked
at
it
it
was
like
the
inauguration
of
the
true
british
fireside
the
cosy
privacy
in
which
after
the
man
had
done
his
work
the
lady
awaited
him
at
home
with
the
steaming
a
generation
before
hudson
there
would
have
been
a
pair
of
slippers
airing
beside
the
fire
but
neither
of
these
preparations
supply
the
ideal
of
perfect
happiness
now
i
say
where
did
you
get
these
hideous
things
said
compton
approaching
the
table
on
which
the
silver
was
laid
out
by
a
special
dispensation
it
was
lady
mariamne
dishes
which
caught
attention
some
old
grandmother
i
suppose
that
had
in
the
house
hallo
if
it
is
the
jew
nell
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
you
got
these
horrors
from
the
jew
they
are
supposed
to
be
quite
handsome
said
elinor
with
a
suppressed
laugh
we
must
not
criticise
it
is
very
kind
of
people
to
send
presents
at
all
we
all
know
it
is
a
very
severe
tax
to
those
who
have
a
great
many
friends
the
stingy
old
miser
said
compton
rolling
in
money
and
to
send
you
these
by
jove
there
a
neat
little
thing
now
that
looks
what
it
is
probably
one
of
your
nice
country
friends
nell
it
was
the
kettle
as
a
kind
providence
decreed
and
both
the
ladies
breathed
an
internal
thanksgiving
shows
like
a
little
gem
beside
that
old
thundering
jew
that
said
the
rector
bridling
a
little
and
pink
with
pleasure
is
our
little
offering
and
i
delighted
to
think
that
it
should
please
so
good
a
judge
it
was
chosen
with
great
care
i
saw
it
first
myself
and
the
idea
flashed
upon
me
quite
an
inspiration
that
it
was
the
very
thing
for
elinor
and
when
i
went
home
i
told
my
wife
the
very
thing
for
her
boudoir
should
she
not
be
seeing
company
or
just
for
your
little
teas
when
you
are
by
yourselves
i
could
at
once
imagine
the
dear
girl
looking
so
pretty
in
one
of
those
wonderful
white
garments
that
are
in
the
next
room
hallo
said
compton
with
a
laugh
do
you
show
off
your
things
in
this
abandoned
way
nell
to
the
killingest
old
cov
she
put
her
hand
up
to
his
mouth
with
a
cry
of
dismay
and
laughter
but
the
rector
with
a
smile
and
another
little
blush
discreetly
turned
his
back
he
was
truly
glad
to
see
that
they
were
so
fond
of
each
other
and
thought
it
was
pretty
and
innocent
that
they
should
not
mind
showing
it
but
it
was
a
little
embarrassing
for
an
old
and
prim
clergyman
to
look
on
what
a
pleasure
it
must
be
to
you
my
dear
lady
he
said
when
the
young
couple
had
gone
which
took
place
very
soon
for
phil
soon
grew
tired
of
the
presents
and
he
was
ill
at
ease
when
there
was
no
window
from
which
he
could
watch
the
road
what
a
pleasure
to
see
them
so
much
attached
of
course
family
advantage
and
position
is
always
of
importance
but
when
you
get
devoted
affection
too
i
hope
there
is
devoted
affection
said
dennistoun
at
all
events
there
is
what
we
are
all
united
in
calling
for
the
present
he
is
in
love
with
elinor
i
do
think
there
can
be
much
doubt
of
that
i
did
not
of
course
know
that
he
was
here
said
the
rector
with
some
hesitation
i
came
with
the
intention
of
speaking
i
am
very
sorry
to
see
in
the
papers
something
about
that
company
of
which
compton
was
a
director
it
rather
a
mysterious
paragraph
but
it
something
about
the
manager
having
absconded
and
that
some
of
the
directors
are
said
to
be
involved
do
you
mean
my
future
she
said
turning
quickly
upon
him
good
heavens
no
i
would
for
the
world
insinuate
it
was
only
that
one
felt
a
desire
to
know
just
upon
the
eve
of
a
marriage
it
it
alarming
to
hear
of
a
business
the
bridegroom
is
involved
in
being
what
you
may
call
broken
up
that
was
one
of
the
things
compton
came
to
tell
us
about
said
dennistoun
he
said
he
hoped
it
might
be
kept
out
of
the
papers
but
that
some
of
the
books
have
got
lost
or
destroyed
i
am
afraid
i
know
very
little
about
business
but
he
has
lost
very
little
nothing
to
speak
of
which
was
all
that
concerned
me
to
be
sure
said
the
rector
but
in
a
tone
not
so
assured
as
his
words
it
is
not
perhaps
quite
a
nice
thing
to
be
director
of
a
company
that
that
collapses
in
this
way
i
fear
some
poor
people
will
lose
their
money
i
fear
there
will
be
things
in
the
papers
on
what
ground
she
said
oh
i
do
deny
there
may
be
some
one
to
blame
but
compton
was
i
suspect
only
on
the
board
for
the
sake
of
his
name
he
is
not
a
business
man
he
did
it
as
so
many
do
for
the
sake
of
a
pretence
of
being
in
something
and
then
i
believe
the
directors
got
a
little
by
it
they
had
a
few
hundreds
a
year
to
be
sure
said
hudson
but
still
doubtfully
and
then
he
brightened
up
for
my
part
i
do
believe
there
is
a
word
of
truth
in
it
since
i
have
seen
him
indeed
i
have
quite
changed
my
opinion
a
fine
figure
of
a
man
looking
an
aristocrat
every
inch
of
him
such
a
contrast
and
complement
to
our
dear
elinor
and
so
fond
of
her
a
man
like
that
would
never
have
a
hand
in
any
sham
concern
if
it
was
really
a
bogus
company
as
people
say
he
must
be
one
of
the
sufferers
that
is
quite
my
decided
opinion
only
the
ladies
you
know
the
ladies
who
have
not
seen
him
and
who
are
so
much
more
suspicious
by
nature
i
know
that
you
are
my
dear
dennistoun
would
give
me
no
rest
they
thought
it
was
my
duty
to
interfere
but
i
am
sure
they
are
quite
wrong
to
think
that
it
was
the
ladies
of
the
rector
family
who
were
interfering
made
dennistoun
very
wroth
next
time
they
have
anything
to
say
you
should
make
them
come
themselves
she
said
oh
they
would
not
do
that
they
say
it
is
the
clergyman
business
not
theirs
besides
you
know
i
have
not
time
to
read
all
the
papers
we
get
the
and
mary
dale
has
the
and
another
thing
that
is
all
about
stocks
and
shares
she
has
such
a
head
for
business
far
more
than
i
can
pretend
to
she
thought
hudson
i
fear
i
do
not
wish
to
know
what
was
thought
by
miss
dale
well
you
are
perhaps
right
dennistoun
she
is
only
a
woman
of
course
and
she
may
make
mistakes
it
is
astonishing
though
how
often
she
is
right
she
has
a
head
for
business
that
might
do
for
a
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
she
made
me
sell
out
my
shares
in
that
red
gulch
those
american
investments
have
most
horrible
names
just
a
week
before
the
smash
came
all
from
what
she
had
read
in
the
papers
she
knows
how
to
put
things
together
you
see
so
i
have
reason
to
be
grateful
to
her
for
my
part
and
what
persuaded
you
here
at
windyhill
a
quiet
clergyman
to
put
money
in
any
red
gulch
it
is
a
horrible
name
oh
it
was
mary
i
suppose
said
hudson
she
is
always
looking
out
for
new
investments
she
said
we
should
all
make
our
fortunes
we
did
not
unfortunately
but
she
is
so
clever
she
got
us
out
of
it
with
only
a
very
small
loss
indeed
no
doubt
she
is
very
clever
i
wish
though
that
she
would
let
us
know
definitely
on
what
ground
oh
there
is
no
ground
cried
the
rector
now
that
i
have
seen
compton
i
am
certain
of
it
i
said
to
her
before
i
left
the
rectory
my
dear
mary
i
am
going
like
a
lamb
to
the
slaughter
i
have
no
reason
to
give
if
dennistoun
should
ask
me
and
you
have
no
reason
to
give
and
she
will
probably
put
me
to
the
door
if
i
said
that
before
i
started
you
may
fancy
how
much
more
i
feel
it
now
when
i
have
made
compton
acquaintance
a
fine
aristocratic
face
and
all
the
ease
of
high
breeding
there
are
only
three
lives
and
those
not
very
good
ones
between
him
and
the
title
i
believe
two
robust
brothers
and
an
invalid
who
will
probably
outlive
them
all
that
is
i
believe
the
state
of
the
case
dear
me
what
a
pity
said
the
rector
for
our
little
elinor
would
have
made
a
sweet
little
countess
she
would
grow
a
noble
lady
like
the
one
in
tennyson
poem
well
now
i
must
be
going
and
i
am
extremely
glad
to
have
been
so
lucky
as
to
come
in
just
in
time
it
has
been
the
greatest
pleasure
to
me
to
see
them
together
such
a
loving
couple
dear
me
like
what
one
reads
about
or
remembers
in
old
days
not
like
the
commonplace
pairs
one
has
to
do
with
now
dennistoun
accompanied
the
rector
to
the
garden
gate
she
was
half
inclined
to
laugh
and
half
to
be
angry
and
in
neither
mood
did
hudson
insinuations
which
he
made
so
innocently
have
much
effect
upon
her
mind
but
when
she
took
leave
of
him
at
the
gate
and
came
slowly
back
among
her
brilliant
pausing
here
and
there
mechanically
to
pick
off
a
withered
leaf
or
prop
up
the
too
heavy
head
of
a
late
rose
her
mind
began
to
take
another
turn
she
had
always
been
conscious
of
an
instinctive
suspicion
in
respect
to
her
lover
probably
only
she
said
to
herself
because
he
was
her
lover
and
she
was
jealous
of
the
new
devotion
that
withdrew
from
her
so
completely
the
young
creature
who
had
been
so
fully
her
own
that
is
a
hard
trial
for
a
woman
to
undergo
it
is
only
to
be
borne
when
she
too
is
fascinated
by
her
future
as
happens
in
some
fortunate
cases
otherwise
a
woman
with
an
only
child
is
an
alarming
critic
to
encounter
she
was
not
fascinated
at
all
by
phil
she
was
disappointed
in
elinor
and
almost
thought
her
child
not
so
perfect
as
she
had
believed
when
it
proved
that
she
could
be
fascinated
by
this
man
she
disliked
almost
everything
about
him
his
looks
the
very
air
which
the
rector
thought
so
aristocratic
his
fondness
for
elinor
which
was
not
reverential
enough
to
please
the
mother
and
his
indifference
nay
contempt
for
herself
which
was
not
calculated
to
please
any
woman
she
had
been
roused
into
defence
of
him
in
anger
at
the
interference
and
at
the
insinuation
which
had
no
proof
but
as
that
anger
died
away
other
thoughts
came
into
her
mind
she
began
to
put
the
broken
facts
together
which
already
had
roused
her
to
suspicion
his
sudden
arrival
so
unexpected
walking
from
the
station
a
long
very
long
walk
carrying
his
own
bag
which
was
a
thing
john
tatham
did
but
not
like
phil
compton
and
then
she
remembered
suddenly
his
anxiety
about
the
carriage
on
the
distant
road
his
care
to
place
himself
where
he
could
see
it
she
had
thought
with
a
little
scorn
that
this
was
a
proof
of
his
frivolity
of
the
necessity
of
seeing
people
whoever
these
people
might
be
but
now
there
began
to
be
in
it
something
that
could
have
a
deeper
meaning
for
whom
was
he
looking
who
might
be
coming
stories
she
had
heard
of
fugitives
from
justice
of
swindlers
taking
refuge
in
the
innocence
of
their
families
came
up
into
her
mind
could
it
be
possible
that
elinor
pure
name
could
be
entangled
in
such
a
guilty
web
as
this
chapter
xi
funny
old
poop
said
compton
and
that
is
your
rector
nell
i
shall
tell
dick
there
rare
fun
to
be
had
in
that
house
but
not
for
me
i
know
what
i
shall
be
thinking
of
all
the
time
i
there
odious
little
nell
to
interfere
like
this
with
a
fellow
fun
but
i
say
who
that
woman
who
knows
me
or
my
family
much
good
may
it
do
her
as
i
said
before
tell
me
nell
did
she
speak
ill
of
me
oh
phil
how
could
you
ask
or
what
would
it
matter
if
she
spoke
ever
so
ill
she
did
then
he
said
with
a
graver
face
somebody
was
bound
to
do
it
and
what
did
she
say
oh
what
does
it
matter
phil
i
do
remember
nothing
of
any
consequence
we
paid
no
attention
of
course
neither
mamma
nor
i
that
was
plucky
of
the
old
girl
said
compton
i
did
suppose
you
would
give
ear
my
nell
ai
so
sure
about
her
if
i
been
your
father
my
pet
i
should
never
have
given
you
to
phil
compton
and
that
the
fact
i
wonder
if
the
old
lady
would
like
to
reconsider
the
situation
now
phil
said
elinor
clinging
to
his
arm
perhaps
it
would
be
best
for
you
if
you
were
to
do
so
nell
or
if
she
were
to
insist
upon
it
eh
you
do
know
me
my
darling
that
the
fact
you
too
good
to
understand
us
we
all
the
same
from
the
old
governor
downwards
a
bad
lot
i
feel
a
kind
of
remorseful
over
you
child
that
rosy
old
bloke
though
he
a
snob
makes
a
man
think
of
innocence
somehow
i
do
believe
you
ought
to
marry
me
nell
oh
phil
what
do
you
mean
you
can
not
mean
what
you
say
i
suppose
i
do
or
i
should
say
it
nell
i
should
certainly
if
i
thought
you
were
likely
to
take
my
advice
it
a
kind
of
luxury
to
tell
you
we
a
bad
lot
and
bid
you
throw
me
over
when
i
know
all
along
you
wo
i
should
think
not
indeed
she
said
clinging
to
him
and
looking
up
in
his
face
do
you
know
what
my
cous
i
mean
a
friend
said
to
me
on
that
subject
you
mean
your
cousin
john
whom
you
are
always
quoting
let
hear
what
the
fellow
said
he
said
that
i
was
a
girl
to
put
up
with
much
phil
that
i
one
of
the
patient
kind
that
i
would
not
bear
i
do
know
what
it
was
i
would
not
bear
but
you
see
you
must
consider
my
defects
which
you
can
understand
well
enough
whether
i
can
understand
yours
or
not
that
you
could
not
put
up
with
that
you
could
not
bear
that
meant
me
nell
he
had
been
talking
to
you
on
the
same
subject
me
and
my
faults
why
did
you
listen
to
him
i
suppose
he
wanted
you
to
have
him
instead
of
me
phil
how
dare
you
even
think
of
such
a
thing
it
is
not
true
was
it
then
he
is
a
greater
fool
than
i
took
him
for
and
his
opinion
no
good
so
you
a
spitfire
are
you
ca
put
up
with
anything
that
does
suit
you
i
do
know
that
i
should
have
found
that
out
i
am
afraid
though
that
it
is
true
she
said
looking
up
at
him
perhaps
you
will
want
to
reconsider
too
if
you
do
want
it
any
more
than
i
want
it
nell
what
that
he
cried
hastily
changing
his
expression
and
attitude
in
a
moment
is
that
one
of
your
neighbours
at
the
gate
elinor
looked
round
starting
away
a
little
from
his
side
and
saw
some
one
a
man
she
had
never
seen
before
approaching
along
the
path
she
was
just
about
to
say
she
did
not
know
who
it
was
when
phil
to
her
astonishment
stepped
past
her
advancing
to
meet
the
newcomer
but
as
he
did
so
he
put
out
his
hand
and
caught
her
as
he
passed
leading
her
along
with
him
mind
what
i
said
and
stick
to
me
he
said
in
a
whisper
then
stanfield
he
cried
with
an
air
of
perfect
ease
and
cordiality
yet
astonishment
i
thought
it
looked
like
you
but
i
could
not
believe
my
eyes
mr
compton
said
the
other
so
you
are
here
i
have
been
hunting
after
you
all
over
the
place
i
heard
only
this
morning
this
was
a
likely
spot
a
very
likely
spot
said
phil
i
suppose
you
know
the
good
reason
i
have
for
being
in
these
parts
elinor
this
is
stanfield
who
has
to
do
with
our
company
do
you
know
but
i
say
stanfield
what
all
this
row
in
the
papers
is
it
true
that
brown
bolted
i
should
have
taken
the
first
train
to
see
if
i
could
help
but
my
private
affairs
are
most
urgent
just
at
this
moment
as
i
suppose
you
know
i
wish
you
had
come
said
the
other
it
would
have
looked
well
and
pleased
the
rest
of
the
directors
there
has
been
some
queer
business
some
of
the
books
abstracted
or
destroyed
we
ca
tell
which
and
no
means
of
knowing
how
we
stand
good
heavens
said
phil
to
cover
that
fellow
retreat
it
you
mean
brown
it
was
not
he
they
were
all
there
safe
enough
after
he
was
gone
somebody
must
have
got
in
by
night
and
made
off
with
them
some
one
that
knew
all
about
the
place
the
watchman
saw
a
light
but
that
all
it
supposed
there
must
have
been
something
compromising
others
besides
brown
he
could
not
have
cheated
the
company
to
such
an
extent
by
himself
good
heavens
cried
phil
again
in
natural
horror
i
wish
i
had
followed
my
impulse
and
gone
up
to
town
straight
but
it
was
very
vague
what
was
in
the
papers
i
hoped
it
might
not
have
been
our
place
at
all
and
i
say
stanfield
who
the
fellow
they
suspect
elinor
had
disengaged
herself
from
compton
arm
she
perceived
vaguely
that
the
stranger
paused
before
he
replied
and
that
phil
facing
him
with
a
certain
square
attitude
of
opposition
which
affected
her
imagination
vaguely
though
she
did
not
understand
why
was
waiting
with
keen
attention
for
his
reply
she
said
a
little
oppressed
by
the
situation
phil
perhaps
i
had
better
go
do
go
he
said
there
nothing
secret
to
say
if
there
anyone
suspected
it
must
very
soon
be
known
it
difficult
to
say
who
is
suspected
said
the
stranger
confused
i
do
know
that
there
much
evidence
you
been
in
scotland
yes
till
the
other
day
when
i
came
down
here
to
see
he
paused
and
turned
upon
elinor
a
look
which
gave
the
girl
the
most
curious
incomprehensible
pang
it
was
a
look
of
love
but
oh
heaven
was
it
a
look
called
up
that
the
other
man
might
see
he
took
her
hand
in
his
and
said
lightly
yet
tenderly
let
see
what
day
was
it
the
sixth
was
it
the
sixth
nell
a
flood
of
conflicting
thoughts
poured
through
elinor
mind
what
did
it
mean
it
was
yesterday
she
was
about
to
say
but
something
stopped
her
something
in
phil
eye
in
the
touch
of
his
hand
there
was
something
warning
almost
threatening
in
his
eye
stand
by
me
mind
you
do
contradict
me
say
what
i
say
all
these
things
which
he
had
repeated
again
and
again
were
said
once
more
in
the
look
he
gave
her
yes
she
said
timidly
with
a
hesitation
very
unlike
elinor
it
was
the
sixth
she
seemed
to
see
suddenly
as
she
said
the
words
that
calendar
with
the
date
hanging
in
the
hall
the
big
seemed
to
hang
suspended
in
the
air
it
was
true
though
she
could
not
tell
how
it
could
be
so
oh
said
stanfield
in
a
tone
which
betrayed
a
little
surprise
and
something
like
disappointment
the
sixth
i
knew
you
had
left
scotland
but
we
did
not
know
where
you
had
gone
that
not
to
be
wondered
at
said
phil
with
a
laugh
for
i
should
have
gone
to
ireland
to
tell
the
truth
i
ought
to
have
been
there
now
i
going
ai
i
nell
i
had
not
a
bit
of
business
to
be
here
winding
up
affairs
in
the
bachelor
line
do
you
know
but
i
had
to
come
on
my
way
west
to
see
this
young
lady
first
it
plays
the
deuce
and
all
with
one
plans
when
there
such
a
temptation
in
the
way
you
could
have
gone
from
scotland
to
ireland
said
stanfield
gravely
without
coming
to
town
at
all
very
true
old
man
you
speak
like
a
book
but
as
you
perceive
i
have
not
gone
to
ireland
at
all
i
am
here
depends
upon
your
motive
i
suppose
which
way
you
go
it
is
a
good
way
roundabout
said
the
other
without
relaxing
the
intent
look
on
his
face
well
said
phil
that
as
one
feels
i
go
by
holyhead
wherever
i
may
be
even
if
i
had
nowhere
else
to
go
to
on
the
way
and
compton
got
here
on
the
sixth
this
is
the
eighth
said
the
stranger
pointedly
he
turned
to
elinor
and
it
seemed
to
the
girl
that
his
eyes
though
they
were
not
remarkable
eyes
went
through
and
through
her
he
spoke
very
slowly
with
a
curious
meaning
but
it
was
on
the
sixth
you
say
that
he
got
here
that
big
on
the
calendar
stood
out
before
her
eyes
it
seemed
to
cover
all
the
man
figure
that
stood
before
her
elinor
heart
and
mind
went
through
the
strangest
convulsion
was
it
false
was
it
true
what
was
she
saying
what
did
it
all
mean
she
repeated
mechanically
it
was
on
the
sixth
and
then
she
recovered
a
kind
of
desperate
courage
and
throwing
off
the
strange
spell
that
seemed
to
be
upon
her
is
there
any
reason
she
asked
suddenly
with
a
little
burst
of
impatience
looking
from
one
to
another
why
it
should
not
be
the
sixth
that
you
repeat
it
so
i
beg
your
pardon
said
the
stranger
visibly
startled
i
did
not
mean
to
imply
only
thought
pray
compton
tell
the
lady
i
had
no
intention
of
offending
i
never
supposed
phil
laugh
loud
and
clear
rang
through
the
stillness
of
the
afternoon
he
so
used
to
fibs
he
thinks
everybody
in
a
tale
said
phil
but
i
can
assure
you
he
is
a
very
good
fellow
and
a
great
friend
of
mine
and
he
means
no
harm
nell
elinor
made
stanfield
an
extremely
dignified
bow
i
ought
to
have
gone
away
at
once
and
left
you
to
talk
over
your
business
she
said
turning
away
and
phil
did
not
attempt
to
detain
her
then
the
natural
rural
sense
of
hospitality
came
over
elinor
she
turned
back
to
find
the
two
men
looking
after
her
standing
where
she
had
left
them
i
am
sure
she
said
that
mamma
would
wish
me
to
ask
the
gentleman
if
he
would
stay
to
dinner
or
at
least
come
in
with
you
phil
to
tea
stanfield
took
off
his
hat
with
anxious
politeness
and
exclaimed
hastily
that
he
must
go
back
to
town
by
the
next
train
and
that
the
cab
from
the
station
was
waiting
to
take
him
and
then
she
left
them
and
walked
quietly
away
she
was
almost
out
of
hearing
before
they
resumed
their
conversation
that
is
she
was
beyond
the
sound
not
of
their
voices
but
of
what
they
said
the
murmur
of
the
voices
was
still
audible
when
she
got
to
her
favourite
seat
on
the
side
of
the
copse
looking
down
the
combe
it
was
a
very
retired
and
silent
place
not
visible
from
either
the
cottage
or
the
garden
and
there
elinor
took
refuge
in
the
quiet
and
hush
of
the
declining
day
she
was
in
a
great
tremor
of
agitation
and
excitement
as
she
sat
down
upon
the
rustic
seat
so
great
a
tremor
that
she
had
scarcely
been
able
to
walk
steadily
down
the
steps
a
tremor
which
had
grown
with
every
step
she
took
she
did
not
in
the
least
understand
the
transaction
in
which
she
had
been
engaged
it
was
something
altogether
strange
to
her
experiences
without
any
precedent
in
her
life
what
was
it
she
had
been
called
upon
to
do
what
had
she
said
and
why
had
she
been
made
to
say
it
her
heart
beat
so
that
she
put
her
two
hands
upon
it
crossed
over
her
breast
to
keep
it
down
lest
it
should
burst
away
she
had
the
sensation
of
having
been
brought
before
some
tribunal
put
suddenly
to
the
last
shift
made
to
say
what
what
she
was
so
bewildered
that
she
could
not
tell
was
it
the
truth
said
with
the
intention
to
deceive
was
it
she
could
not
tell
there
was
that
great
numeral
wavering
in
the
air
stalking
along
with
her
like
a
ghost
she
had
read
it
in
all
innocence
they
had
all
read
it
and
nobody
had
said
it
was
wrong
no
one
was
very
careful
about
the
date
in
the
cottage
if
it
was
right
if
it
was
wrong
elinor
could
not
tell
but
yet
somehow
she
was
conscious
that
the
man
to
whom
she
had
spoken
had
been
deceived
and
phil
and
phil
what
had
he
meant
adjuring
her
to
stick
to
him
to
stand
by
him
not
to
contradict
him
elinor
mind
was
in
such
a
wild
commotion
that
she
could
not
answer
these
inquiries
she
could
not
feel
that
she
had
one
solid
step
of
ground
to
place
herself
upon
in
the
whirlwind
which
swept
her
about
and
about
had
she
lied
and
why
had
he
asked
her
to
lie
and
what
oh
what
did
it
all
mean
one
thing
that
at
last
appeared
to
her
in
the
chaos
which
seemed
like
something
solid
that
she
could
grasp
at
was
that
phil
had
never
changed
in
his
aspect
the
other
man
had
been
very
serious
staring
at
her
as
if
to
intimidate
her
like
a
man
who
had
something
to
find
out
but
phil
had
been
as
careless
as
indifferent
as
he
appeared
always
to
be
he
had
not
changed
his
expression
it
is
true
there
was
that
look
in
which
there
was
at
once
an
entreaty
and
a
command
but
only
she
had
seen
that
and
perhaps
it
was
merely
the
emotion
the
excitement
the
strange
feeling
of
having
to
face
the
world
for
him
and
say
what
what
was
it
simply
the
truth
nothing
but
the
truth
or
was
it
again
elinor
mind
began
to
whirl
it
was
the
truth
she
could
see
now
that
big
on
the
calendar
distinct
as
the
sunshine
and
yet
it
was
only
yesterday
and
there
was
this
morning
had
she
gone
through
an
intervening
dream
for
a
whole
day
without
knowing
it
or
had
she
elinor
she
who
would
not
have
done
it
to
save
her
life
told
a
lie
for
phil
and
why
should
he
want
her
to
tell
a
lie
elinor
got
up
from
her
seat
and
stood
uncertain
with
a
cold
dew
on
her
forehead
and
her
hands
clasping
and
holding
each
other
should
she
go
back
to
them
and
say
there
must
be
some
mistake
that
though
she
had
said
the
truth
it
was
not
true
that
there
was
some
mistake
some
dreadful
mistake
there
was
no
longer
any
sound
of
voices
where
she
was
the
whole
incident
seemed
to
have
died
out
the
sudden
commotion
of
phil
visit
and
everything
connected
with
it
had
passed
away
she
was
alone
in
the
afternoon
in
the
hush
of
nature
looking
over
the
combe
listening
to
the
rustle
of
the
trees
hearing
the
bees
drone
homeward
had
phil
ever
been
here
at
all
had
he
watched
the
distant
road
winding
over
the
slopes
for
some
one
whom
he
had
expected
to
come
after
him
all
the
time
had
he
ever
told
her
to
stand
by
him
to
say
what
he
said
to
back
him
up
had
there
ever
been
another
man
standing
with
that
big
wavering
between
her
and
him
like
a
ghost
had
all
that
been
at
all
or
was
it
merely
a
foolish
dream
and
ought
she
to
go
back
now
and
find
the
man
before
he
disappeared
and
tell
him
it
was
all
true
yet
somehow
a
dreadful
dreadful
mistake
elinor
sat
down
again
abruptly
on
her
seat
and
put
her
handkerchief
to
her
forehead
and
pushed
back
the
damp
clusters
of
her
hair
turning
her
face
to
the
wind
to
get
a
little
refreshment
and
calm
if
that
were
possible
she
heard
in
the
sunny
distance
behind
her
where
the
garden
and
the
peaceful
house
lay
in
the
light
the
clang
of
the
gate
a
sound
which
could
not
be
mistaken
the
man
then
had
gone
if
there
was
anything
to
rectify
in
what
she
said
it
certainly
could
not
be
rectified
now
he
was
gone
the
certainty
came
to
her
with
a
feeling
of
relief
it
had
been
horrible
to
think
of
standing
before
the
two
men
again
and
saying
what
could
she
have
said
she
remembered
now
that
it
was
not
her
assertion
alone
but
that
it
all
hung
together
a
whole
structure
of
incidents
which
would
be
put
wrong
if
she
had
said
it
was
a
mistake
a
whole
account
of
phil
time
how
it
had
been
passed
which
was
quite
true
which
he
had
told
them
on
his
arrival
how
he
had
been
going
to
ireland
and
had
stopped
longing
for
a
glimpse
of
her
his
bride
feeling
that
he
must
have
her
by
him
see
her
once
again
before
he
came
for
her
to
fetch
her
away
he
had
told
the
ladies
at
the
cottage
the
very
same
and
of
course
it
was
true
had
he
not
come
straight
from
scotland
with
his
big
bundle
of
game
the
grouse
and
partridges
which
had
already
been
shared
with
all
the
friends
about
was
he
not
going
off
to
ireland
to
fulfil
his
first
intention
it
was
all
quite
right
quite
true
hanging
perfectly
together
except
that
curious
falling
out
of
a
day
and
then
again
elinor
brain
swam
round
and
round
had
he
been
two
days
at
the
cottage
instead
of
one
as
he
said
was
it
there
that
the
mistake
lay
had
she
been
in
such
a
paradise
having
him
there
that
she
had
not
marked
the
passage
of
time
had
it
all
been
one
hour
of
happiness
flying
like
the
wind
a
blush
partly
of
sweet
shame
to
think
that
this
was
possible
that
she
might
have
been
such
a
happy
fool
as
to
ignore
the
divisions
of
night
and
day
and
partly
of
stimulating
hope
that
such
might
be
the
case
a
wild
snatch
at
justification
of
herself
and
him
flushed
over
her
from
head
to
foot
wrapping
her
in
warmth
and
delight
and
then
this
all
faded
away
again
and
left
her
as
in
ashes
black
and
cold
no
everything
she
saw
now
depended
upon
what
she
had
been
impelled
to
say
the
whole
construction
phil
account
of
his
time
his
story
of
his
doings
all
would
have
fallen
to
pieces
had
she
said
otherwise
body
and
soul
elinor
felt
herself
become
like
a
machine
full
of
clanging
wheels
and
beating
pistons
her
heart
her
pulses
her
breath
all
panting
beating
bursting
what
did
it
mean
what
did
it
mean
and
then
everything
stood
still
in
a
horrible
suspense
and
pause
she
began
to
hear
voices
again
in
the
distance
and
raised
her
head
which
she
had
buried
in
her
hands
voices
that
sounded
so
calmly
in
the
westering
sunshine
one
answering
another
everything
softened
in
the
golden
outdoor
light
at
first
as
she
raised
herself
up
she
thought
with
horror
that
it
was
the
man
the
visitor
whom
she
had
supposed
to
be
gone
returning
with
phil
to
give
her
the
opportunity
of
contradicting
herself
of
bringing
back
that
whirlwind
of
doubt
and
possibility
but
presently
her
excited
senses
perceived
that
it
was
her
mother
who
was
walking
calmly
through
the
garden
talking
with
phil
there
was
not
a
tone
of
excitement
in
the
quiet
voices
that
came
gradually
nearer
and
nearer
till
she
could
hear
what
they
were
saying
it
was
phil
who
was
speaking
while
her
mother
now
and
then
put
in
a
word
elinor
did
not
wish
on
ordinary
occasions
for
too
many
private
talks
between
her
mother
and
phil
they
rubbed
each
other
the
wrong
way
they
did
not
understand
each
other
words
seemed
to
mean
different
things
in
their
comprehension
of
them
she
knew
that
her
lover
would
laugh
at
the
old
girl
which
was
a
phrase
which
offended
elinor
deeply
and
dennistoun
would
become
stiffer
and
stiffer
declaring
that
the
very
language
of
the
younger
generation
had
become
unintelligible
to
her
but
to
hear
them
now
together
was
a
kind
of
anodyne
to
elinor
it
stayed
and
calmed
her
the
cold
moisture
dried
from
her
forehead
she
smoothed
her
hair
instinctively
with
her
hand
and
put
herself
straight
in
mind
as
she
did
with
that
involuntary
action
in
outward
appearance
feeling
that
no
sign
of
agitation
no
trouble
of
demeanour
must
meet
her
mother
eye
and
then
the
voices
came
so
near
that
she
could
hear
what
they
were
saying
they
were
coming
amicably
together
to
her
favourite
retreat
it
a
very
queer
thing
said
phil
if
it
is
as
they
think
that
somebody
went
there
the
night
before
last
and
cleared
off
the
books
well
not
all
the
books
some
that
are
supposed
to
contain
the
secret
transactions
deucedly
cleverly
done
it
must
have
been
if
it
was
done
at
all
for
nobody
saw
the
fellow
or
fellows
if
there
were
more
than
one
why
do
you
doubt
said
dennistoun
is
there
any
way
of
accounting
for
it
otherwise
oh
a
very
good
way
that
brown
the
manager
simply
took
them
with
him
as
he
would
naturally
do
if
he
was
a
fool
why
should
he
go
off
and
leave
papers
that
would
convict
him
for
the
pleasure
of
involving
other
fellows
and
ruining
them
too
are
there
others
then
involved
with
him
oh
how
calm
how
inconceivably
calm
was
dennistoun
voice
had
she
been
asking
the
gardener
about
the
slugs
that
eat
the
young
plants
it
would
have
been
more
disturbed
well
stanfield
seemed
to
think
so
he
a
sort
of
head
clerk
a
fellow
enormously
trusted
i
should
wonder
if
he
was
at
the
bottom
of
it
himself
they
so
sure
of
him
said
phil
with
a
laugh
he
says
there
a
kind
of
suspicion
of
two
or
three
clumsy
wretches
they
must
be
if
they
let
themselves
be
found
out
like
that
but
i
do
believe
it
i
believe
brown
alone
in
it
and
that
it
him
that
taken
everything
away
i
believe
it
far
the
safest
way
in
those
kind
of
dodges
to
be
alone
you
get
all
the
swag
and
you
in
no
danger
of
being
rounded
on
do
you
know
till
you
find
things
are
getting
too
hot
and
you
cut
away
i
do
understand
the
words
you
use
but
i
think
i
know
what
you
mean
said
dennistoun
how
dreadful
it
is
to
think
that
in
business
where
honesty
is
the
very
first
principle
there
should
be
such
terrible
plots
and
plans
as
those
is
awful
is
it
said
phil
with
a
laugh
that
seemed
to
ring
all
down
the
combe
and
came
back
in
echoes
from
the
opposite
slope
where
in
the
distance
the
cab
from
the
station
was
seen
hastening
back
towards
the
railway
in
a
cloud
of
dust
the
laugh
was
like
a
trumpet
of
triumph
flung
across
the
distance
at
the
discomfited
enemy
thus
going
off
drooping
in
the
hurry
of
defeat
he
added
but
you
may
imagine
even
if
i
had
known
anything
he
would
have
got
much
out
of
me
i
did
know
anything
however
i
very
glad
to
say
that
is
always
the
best
said
dennistoun
with
a
certain
grave
didactic
tone
and
here
is
elinor
as
i
thought
when
one
can
not
find
her
anywhere
else
she
sure
to
be
found
here
chapter
xii
well
said
compton
placing
himself
beside
her
here
you
are
nell
kind
of
the
old
lady
to
bring
me
was
it
i
should
never
have
found
you
out
by
myself
has
he
gone
phil
elinor
raised
her
scared
face
from
her
hands
and
gave
him
a
piteous
look
why
nell
you
are
trembling
like
a
leaf
was
it
frightened
my
pretty
pet
for
stanny
stanny
gone
off
with
his
tail
between
his
legs
not
a
bit
of
starch
left
in
him
as
limp
a
lawyer
as
ever
you
saw
was
he
a
lawyer
she
said
not
knowing
why
she
said
it
for
it
mattered
nothing
at
all
to
elinor
what
the
man
was
not
exactly
and
yet
i
suppose
something
of
the
kind
he
is
the
one
that
knows
about
law
points
and
such
things
but
now
he
as
quiet
as
a
lamb
thanks
to
you
phil
she
cried
what
did
you
make
me
say
i
do
know
what
i
have
done
i
have
done
something
dreadful
deceived
the
man
as
good
as
told
him
a
lie
you
told
him
the
truth
said
phil
with
a
laugh
in
the
most
judgmatical
way
you
stuck
to
it
like
a
woman
there
nothing
like
a
woman
for
sticking
to
a
text
you
did
say
a
word
too
much
and
i
say
nell
that
little
defiant
bit
of
yours
there
any
reason
why
it
should
be
the
sixth
was
grand
that
was
quite
magnificent
my
pet
i
never
thought
you
had
such
spirit
in
you
oh
phil
she
cried
why
did
you
make
me
say
it
what
was
it
i
said
i
do
know
i
do
understand
a
bit
whatever
it
was
i
know
that
it
was
wrong
i
deceived
the
man
that
not
so
great
a
sin
he
said
i
known
worse
things
done
put
an
old
reynard
off
the
scent
to
save
his
prey
i
do
see
what
wrong
in
that
especially
as
the
innocent
chicken
to
be
saved
was
your
own
poor
old
phil
phil
phil
she
cried
what
could
that
man
have
done
to
you
what
had
put
you
in
his
power
you
have
made
me
lose
all
my
innocence
i
have
got
horrible
things
in
my
head
what
could
he
have
done
to
you
that
you
made
me
tell
a
lie
what
lie
did
i
make
you
tell
be
reasonable
i
did
arrive
on
the
sixth
you
know
that
just
as
well
as
i
do
do
you
really
remember
the
calendar
in
the
hall
you
saw
it
nell
as
well
as
i
i
know
i
know
she
cried
putting
her
hands
up
to
her
eyes
i
see
it
everywhere
staring
at
me
that
big
dreadful
but
how
is
it
the
now
there
is
something
in
it
something
i
do
understand
he
laughed
loudly
and
long
one
of
those
boisterous
laughs
which
always
jarred
upon
elinor
i
do
in
the
least
mind
how
it
was
he
said
it
was
and
that
quite
enough
for
me
and
let
it
be
for
you
too
nell
i
hope
you
not
going
to
search
into
the
origin
of
things
like
this
we
quite
enough
to
do
in
this
world
to
take
things
as
they
come
oh
phil
if
at
least
i
could
understand
i
do
understand
or
if
i
had
not
been
made
to
say
what
is
so
mysterious
what
must
be
false
hush
nell
how
could
it
be
false
when
you
saw
with
your
own
eyes
it
was
true
now
let
us
be
done
with
this
my
darling
the
incident
is
terminated
as
the
french
say
i
came
here
as
fast
as
i
could
come
to
have
a
good
laugh
with
you
over
it
and
lo
you
nearer
crying
why
should
you
have
stanny
on
your
conscience
nell
a
fellow
that
would
like
no
better
than
to
hang
me
if
he
could
get
the
chance
but
phil
phil
oh
tell
me
what
could
this
man
have
done
to
you
why
are
you
afraid
of
him
why
why
have
you
made
me
tell
him
now
nell
no
exaggerated
expression
it
was
a
fact
you
told
him
according
to
the
best
of
evidence
and
what
he
could
have
done
to
me
is
just
this
he
might
have
given
me
a
deal
of
trouble
and
put
off
our
marriage
i
should
have
had
to
go
back
to
town
and
my
time
would
have
been
taken
up
with
finding
out
about
those
books
and
our
marriage
would
have
been
put
off
that
what
he
could
have
done
is
that
all
cried
elinor
was
that
all
all
he
said
with
that
loud
laugh
again
you
do
mind
a
bit
how
you
hurt
a
fellow
pride
and
his
affections
and
all
that
do
you
mean
to
say
you
little
coquette
that
you
would
mind
i
do
believe
you
would
mind
here
am
i
counting
the
hours
and
you
you
little
cold
puss
you
aggravating
little
oh
phil
do
talk
such
nonsense
if
we
were
to
be
separated
for
a
week
or
a
month
what
could
that
matter
in
comparison
with
saying
what
was
hush
he
said
putting
his
hand
to
her
mouth
it
not
nice
of
you
to
take
it
so
easily
nell
i
tell
as
many
d
as
you
like
rather
than
put
it
off
an
hour
why
feeling
apart
and
i
do
think
you
any
feeling
you
little
piece
of
ice
think
how
inconvenient
it
would
have
been
the
people
all
arriving
the
breakfast
all
ready
the
rector
with
his
surplice
on
and
no
wedding
fancy
the
jew
with
all
her
fallals
on
the
old
lady
hands
and
your
cousin
john
i
have
told
you
already
phil
my
cousin
john
will
not
be
there
so
much
the
better
he
said
with
a
laugh
i
do
want
him
to
be
there
shows
his
sense
when
his
nose
is
put
out
of
joint
to
keep
out
of
the
way
i
wish
you
would
understand
she
said
with
a
little
vexation
that
john
is
not
put
out
of
joint
as
you
say
in
that
odious
way
he
has
never
been
anything
more
to
me
nor
i
to
him
than
we
are
now
like
brother
and
sister
the
more
fool
he
said
compton
to
have
the
chance
of
a
nice
girl
like
you
nell
and
not
to
go
in
for
it
but
i
do
believe
a
bit
in
the
brother
and
sister
dodge
we
will
be
just
the
same
all
our
lives
cried
elinor
not
if
i
know
it
said
phil
i
an
fellow
in
most
ways
but
you
find
i
an
old
turk
about
you
my
little
duck
of
a
nell
no
amateur
brother
for
me
if
you
ca
get
along
with
your
old
phil
without
other
adorers
phil
as
if
i
should
ever
think
or
care
whether
there
was
another
man
in
the
world
oh
that
going
too
far
he
said
laughing
i
sha
mind
a
little
flirtation
you
may
have
a
man
or
two
in
your
train
to
fetch
and
carry
get
your
shawl
for
you
and
call
your
carriage
and
so
forth
but
no
serious
old
hand
nell
nothing
to
remind
you
that
there
was
a
time
when
you
did
know
phil
compton
his
laugh
died
away
at
this
point
and
for
a
moment
his
face
assumed
that
grave
look
which
changed
its
character
so
much
if
you
do
come
to
repent
before
then
that
you
ever
saw
that
fellow
ugly
face
nell
phil
how
could
i
ever
repent
nobody
but
you
should
dare
to
say
such
a
thing
to
me
i
believe
that
he
said
if
that
old
john
of
yours
tried
it
on
well
my
pet
he
is
your
old
john
you
ca
change
facts
even
if
you
do
throw
the
poor
fellow
over
now
here
a
new
chance
for
all
of
them
nell
i
should
wonder
a
bit
if
you
had
another
crop
of
letters
bidding
you
look
before
you
leap
that
rectory
woman
what
her
name
that
knows
my
family
you
see
she
have
some
new
story
before
clear
of
her
they
never
stop
blackguarding
me
i
know
until
phil
compton
yourself
my
beauty
i
wish
that
day
was
come
i
afraid
to
go
off
again
and
leave
you
nell
they
be
putting
something
into
your
head
or
the
old
lady
let
get
it
over
morning
and
come
to
ireland
with
me
you
never
been
there
phil
what
nonsense
mamma
would
go
out
of
her
senses
my
pet
what
does
it
matter
she
come
back
to
them
again
as
soon
as
we
were
gone
and
think
what
a
botheration
spared
her
all
the
row
of
receiving
people
turning
the
house
upside
down
and
here
i
am
on
the
spot
and
what
do
you
want
with
bridesmaids
and
so
forth
you
got
all
your
things
suppose
we
walk
out
to
church
before
breakfast
nell
phil
you
are
mad
i
think
and
why
should
we
do
such
a
thing
scandalizing
everybody
but
of
course
you
do
mean
it
you
are
excited
after
seeing
that
man
excited
about
stanny
not
such
a
fool
stanny
is
all
square
thanks
to
but
what
i
want
is
just
to
take
you
up
in
my
arms
like
this
and
run
off
with
you
nell
why
we
should
call
the
whole
world
to
watch
us
while
we
take
that
swing
off
into
space
phil
so
it
is
for
you
nell
you
do
know
a
bit
what
going
to
happen
you
do
know
where
i
going
to
take
you
and
what
i
going
to
do
with
you
you
little
innocent
lamb
in
the
wolf
grip
i
want
to
eat
you
up
straight
off
i
shall
be
afraid
up
to
the
last
moment
that
escape
me
nell
i
did
not
know
that
you
were
so
fond
of
innocence
said
elinor
half
afraid
of
her
lover
vehemence
and
trying
to
dispel
his
gravity
with
a
laugh
you
used
to
say
you
did
not
believe
in
the
i
believe
in
you
he
said
with
an
almost
fierce
pressure
of
her
arm
then
after
a
pause
no
i
do
believe
in
women
at
all
nell
only
you
they
rather
worse
than
men
which
is
saying
a
good
deal
what
would
the
jew
care
if
we
were
all
drawn
and
quartered
so
long
as
she
had
all
her
paraphernalia
about
her
and
got
everything
she
wanted
for
selfishness
commend
me
to
a
woman
a
fellow
may
have
gleams
of
something
better
about
him
like
me
warning
you
against
myself
it
is
a
droll
way
of
warning
me
against
yourself
to
want
to
carry
me
off
it
all
the
same
thing
he
said
i
warned
you
that
those
old
hags
are
right
and
i
not
good
enough
for
you
not
fit
to
come
near
you
nell
but
if
the
sacrifice
is
to
be
let
get
it
over
at
once
let
us
stand
and
think
of
it
i
capable
of
jilting
you
he
said
leaving
you
all
out
of
remorse
of
conscience
or
else
just
catching
you
up
in
my
arms
like
this
and
carrying
you
off
never
to
be
seen
more
you
are
very
alarming
said
elinor
i
do
know
what
you
mean
you
can
be
off
with
your
bargain
if
you
please
phil
but
you
had
better
make
up
your
mind
at
once
so
that
mamma
may
countermand
her
invitations
and
stop
gunter
from
sending
the
cake
it
was
gunter
who
was
the
man
in
those
days
i
believe
people
go
to
buszard
now
he
gave
her
again
a
vehement
hug
and
burst
into
a
laugh
i
might
jilt
you
nell
such
a
thing
is
on
the
cards
i
might
leave
you
in
the
lurch
at
the
church
door
but
when
you
talk
of
countermanding
the
cake
i
ca
face
that
situation
society
would
naturally
be
up
in
arms
about
that
so
you
must
take
your
chance
like
the
other
innocents
i
eat
you
up
as
gently
as
i
can
and
hide
my
tusks
as
long
as
it
possible
come
on
nell
do
let
us
sit
here
and
get
the
mopes
and
think
of
our
consciences
come
and
see
if
that
show
is
in
the
village
life
better
than
thinking
old
girl
do
you
call
the
show
in
the
village
life
she
said
half
pleased
to
rouse
him
half
sorry
to
be
thus
carried
away
every
show
is
life
said
phil
and
everywhere
that
people
meet
is
better
than
anywhere
where
you
alone
mind
you
take
in
that
axiom
nell
it
our
rule
of
life
you
know
among
the
set
you
marrying
into
that
how
the
jew
gets
on
that
how
we
all
get
on
by
this
time
next
year
you
be
well
inured
into
it
like
all
the
rest
that
what
your
rector
never
taught
you
i
be
bound
but
you
see
the
old
fellow
practises
it
whenever
he
has
a
chance
why
there
they
begin
come
on
nell
and
do
let
us
lose
the
fun
he
drew
her
along
hastily
hurrying
while
the
flute
and
the
drum
began
to
perform
their
parts
sound
spreads
far
in
that
tranquil
country
where
no
railway
was
visible
and
where
the
winds
for
the
moment
were
still
it
was
pan
pipes
that
were
being
played
attracting
a
few
stragglers
from
the
scattered
houses
within
a
hundred
yards
from
the
church
at
the
corner
of
four
roads
stood
the
bull
head
with
a
cottage
or
two
linked
on
to
its
long
straggling
front
and
this
was
all
that
did
duty
for
a
village
at
windyhill
the
rectory
stood
back
in
its
own
copse
surrounded
by
a
growth
of
young
birches
and
oak
near
the
church
the
hills
dwelt
intermediate
between
the
bull
head
and
the
ecclesiastical
establishment
the
school
and
schoolmaster
house
were
behind
the
bull
the
show
was
surrounded
by
the
children
of
the
place
who
looked
on
silent
with
ecstasy
while
a
burly
showman
piped
his
pipes
and
beat
his
drum
a
couple
of
ostlers
with
their
rolled
up
to
their
shoulders
and
one
of
them
with
a
pail
in
his
hand
stood
arrested
in
their
work
and
in
the
front
of
the
spectators
was
alick
hudson
a
youth
of
twenty
who
started
and
took
his
hands
out
of
his
pockets
at
sight
of
elinor
hudson
himself
came
walking
briskly
round
the
corner
swinging
his
cane
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
was
afraid
of
being
too
late
did
i
tell
you
said
compton
pressing
elinor
arm
as
the
went
on
other
spectators
appeared
the
two
miss
hills
one
putting
on
her
hat
the
other
hastily
buttoning
her
jacket
as
they
hurried
up
oh
you
here
elinor
what
fun
we
all
run
as
if
we
were
six
years
old
i
going
to
engage
the
man
to
come
round
and
do
it
opposite
rosebank
to
amuse
mother
she
likes
it
as
much
as
any
of
us
though
she
does
see
very
well
poor
dear
nor
hear
either
but
we
must
always
consider
that
the
old
have
not
many
amusements
said
the
elder
miss
hill
though
mother
amuses
herself
wonderfully
with
her
knitting
said
miss
sarah
there
a
on
the
stocks
for
you
elinor
it
appeared
to
be
only
at
this
moment
that
the
sisters
became
aware
of
the
presence
of
the
gentleman
by
whom
elinor
stood
they
had
been
too
busy
with
their
uncompleted
toilettes
to
observe
him
at
first
but
now
that
miss
hill
hat
was
settled
to
her
satisfaction
and
the
blue
veil
tied
over
her
face
as
she
liked
it
to
be
and
miss
sarah
had
at
last
succeeded
after
two
false
starts
in
buttoning
her
jacket
straight
their
attention
was
released
for
other
details
they
both
gave
a
glance
over
elinor
at
the
tall
figure
on
the
other
side
and
then
looked
at
each
other
with
a
mutual
little
oh
and
nod
of
recognition
then
miss
hill
took
the
initiative
as
became
her
dignity
i
hope
you
are
going
to
introduce
us
to
your
companion
elinor
she
said
oh
compton
how
do
you
do
we
are
delighted
to
make
your
acquaintance
i
am
sure
it
is
charming
to
have
an
opportunity
of
seeing
a
person
of
so
much
importance
to
us
all
our
dear
elinor
intended
i
hope
you
know
what
a
prize
you
are
getting
you
might
have
sought
the
whole
country
over
and
you
would
have
found
a
girl
like
her
i
do
know
how
we
shall
endure
your
name
when
you
carry
her
away
except
indeed
said
miss
sarah
that
it
will
be
elinor
name
too
so
here
we
all
are
again
said
the
rector
gazing
down
tranquilly
upon
his
flock
not
able
to
resist
a
little
histrionic
exhibition
and
compton
too
fresh
from
the
great
world
i
daresay
our
good
friend
basset
would
hand
us
out
some
chairs
no
englishman
can
resist
punch
alick
my
boy
you
ought
to
be
at
your
work
it
will
not
do
to
neglect
your
lessons
when
you
are
so
near
your
exam
no
englishman
father
can
resist
punch
said
the
lad
at
which
the
two
ostlers
and
the
landlord
of
the
bull
head
who
was
standing
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
in
his
own
doorway
laughed
loud
had
the
old
fellow
there
said
compton
which
was
the
first
observation
he
had
made
the
ladies
looked
at
him
with
some
horror
and
alick
a
little
flustered
half
pleased
half
horrified
by
this
support
while
the
rector
laughed
but
stiffly
bout
des
he
was
not
accustomed
to
be
called
an
old
fellow
in
his
own
parish
the
old
fellows
as
you
elegantly
say
compton
have
always
the
worst
of
it
in
a
popular
assembly
elinor
here
is
a
chair
for
you
my
love
another
one
please
basset
for
i
see
miss
dale

up
this
way
by
jove
said
compton
under
his
breath
elinor
here

one
that
knows
society
i
hope
she
is
such
an
old
guy
as
the
rest
oh
phil
be
good
said
elinor
or
let
us
go
away
which
would
be
the
best
not
a
bit
he
said

show

o
that

and
my
mate
well
here
is
a
nice
little
party
for
you
my
man
said
the
rector
it
is
not
often
you

such
an
audience
nor
would
i
encourage
it
indeed
if
it
were
not
so
purely
english
an
exhibition
master
said
the
showman
worst
of
it
is
nobody
pays
till

the
show
and
then
they

and
they
got
it

in
their
insides
and
there
nothink
then
neither
for
my
mate
nor
me
here
for
you
old
fellow
said
phil
he
took
a
sovereign
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
and
chucked
it
with
his
thumbnail
into
the
man
hand
who
looked
at
it
with
astonished
delight
tossed
it
into
the
air
with
a
grin
a
gentleman
and
a
call
to
his
mate
who
immediately
began
the
drama
the
thrill
of
sensation
which
ran
through
the
little
assembly
at
this
incident
was
wonderful
the
children
all
turned
from
punch
to
regard
with
large
open
eyes
and
mouths
the
gentleman
who
had
given
a
gold
sovereign
to
the
showman
alick
hudson
looked
at
him
with
a
grin
of
pleasure
a
blush
of
envy
on
his
face
the
rector
with
an
expression
of
horror
slightly
shaking
his
head
the
miss
hills
with
admiration
yet
dismay
goodness
sarah
they
never
come
now
and
do
it
for
a
shilling
to
amuse
mother
the
elder
of
the
sisters
said
miss
dale
came
hurrying
up
while
still
the
sensation
lasted
here
is
a
chair
for
you
mary
said
her
and
the
play
is
just
going
to
begin
i
ca
help
shaking
my
head
when
i
think
of
it
but
still
you
must
hear
what
has
just
happened
compton
let
me
present
you
to
my
miss
dale
compton
has
made
the
heart
nay
not
the
widow
but
the
showman
heart
to
sing
he
has
presented
our
friend
with
a
mind
you
said
phil
from
behind
elinor
shoulders
i
paid
the
fellow
only
for
two
at
which
the
showman
turned
and
winked
at
the
rector
to
think
that
such
a
piece
of
audacity
could
be
a
dingy
fellow
in
a
velveteen
coat
with
a
spotted
handkerchief
round
his
neck
and
a
battered
hat
on
his
unkempt
locks
with
pan
pipes
at
his
mouth
and
a
drum
tied
round
his
waist
winked
at
the
rector
hudson
fell
back
a
step
and
his
very
lips
were
livid
with
the
indignity
he
had
to
support
himself
on
the
back
of
the
chair
he
had
just
given
to
miss
dale
i
think
we
are
all
forgetting
our
different
positions
in
this
world
he
said
i
ai
said
the
showman
not
taking
no
advantage
through
the
gentleman
noble
ways
he
a
lord
he
is
i
do
make
no
doubt
and
we
paid
take
the
good
of
it
and
welcome
all
them
as
is
here
is
welcome
my
mate
and
i
are
too
well
paid
a
gentleman
like
that
good
gentleman
as
is
sweet
upon
a
pretty
young
lady
and
an
open
of
her
i
just
wish
we
could
find
one
at
every
station
you
joe
joe
assented
in
the
person
of
punch
with
a
horrible
squeak
from
within
the
tent
the
sensations
of
elinor
during
this
episode
were
peculiar
and
full
of
mingled
emotion
it
is
impossible
to
deny
that
she
was
proud
of
the
effect
produced
by
her
lover
the
sovereign
chucked
into
the
hand
was
a
cheap
way
of
purchasing
a
little
success
and
yet
it
dazzled
elinor
and
made
her
eyelids
droop
and
her
cheek
light
up
with
the
glow
of
pleasure
amid
all
the
people
who
would
search
for
pennies
or
perhaps
painfully
and
not
without
reluctance
produce
a
sixpence
to
reward
the
humble
artists
there
was
something
in
the
careless
familiarity
and
indifference
which
tossed
a
gold
coin
at
them
which
was
calculated
to
charm
the
youthful
observer
elinor
felt
the
same
mixture
of
pleasure
and
envy
which
had
moved
alick
hudson
yet
it
was
not
envy
for
was
not
he
her
own
who
did
this
thing
which
she
would
have
liked
to
have
done
herself
overwhelming
the
poor
tramps
with
delight
elinor
knew
as
alick
also
did
that
it
would
never
have
occurred
to
her
to
do
it
she
would
have
been
glad
to
be
kind
to
the
poor
men
to
give
them
a
good
meal
to
speak
to
basset
at
the
bull
head
in
their
favour
that
they
might
be
taken
in
for
the
night
and
made
comfortable
but
to
open
her
purse
and
take
a
real
sovereign
from
it
a
whole
potential
pound
would
not
have
come
into
her
head
had
such
a
thing
been
done
for
instance
by
the
united
subscriptions
of
the
party
in
case
of
some
peculiarly
touching
situation
the
illness
of
a
wife
the
loss
of
a
child
it
would
have
been
done
solemnly
the
rector
calling
the
men
up
making
a
little
speech
to
them
telling
them
how
all
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
had
united
to
make
up
this
and
how
they
must
be
careful
not
to
spend
it
unworthily
elinor
thought
she
could
see
the
little
scene
and
the
rector
improving
the
occasion
whereas
phil
spun
the
money
through
the
air
into
the
man
ready
hand
as
if
it
had
been
a
joke
a
trick
of
agility
elinor
saw
that
everybody
was
much
impressed
with
the
incident
and
her
heart
went
forth
upon
a
flood
of
satisfaction
and
content
and
it
was
no
premeditated
triumph
it
was
so
noble
so
accidental
so
entirely
out
of
his
good
heart
when
he
hurried
her
home
at
the
end
of
the
performance
that
dennistoun
might
not
be
kept
waiting
the
previous
events
of
the
afternoon
and
all
that
happened
in
the
copse
and
garden
had
faded
out
of
elinor
mind
she
forgot
stanfield
and
the
and
everything
about
it
her
embarrassment
and
trouble
were
gone
she
went
in
gayly
and
told
her
mother
all
about
this
wonderful
incident
the
rector
was
trying
for
a
sixpence
but
mamma
phil
must
not
be
so
ready
with
his
sovereigns
must
he
we
shall
have
nothing
to
live
upon
if
he
goes
chucking
sovereigns
at
every
punch
and
judy
he
may
meet

xiii
phil
compton
went
off
next
morning
by
an
early
train
having
in
the
meanwhile
improved
the
impression
of
him
left
upon
the
family
in
general
and
specially
upon
dennistoun
to
whom
he
had
talked
with
enthusiasm
about
elinor
expressed
indeed
in
terms
unusual
to
her
ears
but
perhaps
only
more
piquant
on
that
account
which
greatly
conciliated
the
mother
do
you
think
said
the
honourable
phil
because
i
speak
a
little
free
and
am
not
one
for
tall
talk
that
i
do
know
what
she
is
i
got
no
poetry
in
me
but
for
the
freest
goer
and
the
highest
spirit
without
a
bit
of
vice
in
her
there
never
was
one
like
nell
the
girls
of
my
set
they
not
worthy
to
tie
her
shoes
thing
i
most
regret
is
taking
her
among
a
lot
that
are
not
half
good
enough
for
her
but
you
ca
help
your
relations
can
you
and
you
have
to
stick
to
them
for
dozens
of
reasons
there
the
jew
when
you
know
her
not
such
a
bad
sort
not
generous
as
you
may
see
from
what
she
given
nell
the
old
screw
but
yet
in
her
own
way
she
stands
by
a
fellow
and
we
need
it
not
having
just
the
bank
of
england
behind
us
her
husband
old
prestwich
is
bad
for
a
man
that
has
made
his
own
money
and
they
got
a
jolly
house
always
something
going
on
but
i
hope
said
dennistoun
that
as
soon
as
these
autumn
visits
are
over
you
will
have
a
house
of
your
own
oh
that
said
compton
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
which
left
it
in
some
doubt
whether
he
was
simply
throwing
off
the
suggestion
or
treating
it
as
a
foregone
conclusion
of
which
there
could
be
no
doubt
nell
he
went
on
gets
on
with
the
jew
like
a
house
on
fire
you
see
they
clash
nell
ai
one
of
the
mannish
sort
and
she
does
flirt
at
least
not
as
far
as
i
seen
i
should
hope
not
indeed
said
dennistoun
oh
i
not
one
of
your
curmudgeons
where
the
harm
but
she
do
and
there
an
end
of
it
she
keeps
herself
to
herself
and
lets
the
jew
go
ahead
and
think
she
the
attraction
and
she
please
the
old
lord
down
to
the
ground
for
he
an
old
coon
and
likes
what
he
calls
do
you
know
but
the
end
is
there
ai
one
of
them
that
can
hold
a
candle
to
nell
and
i
should
not
wonder
a
bit
if
she
made
a
change
in
the
lot
of
us
conversion
of
a
family
by
the
influence
of
a
pious
wife
do
you
know
sort
of
thing
that
they
make
tracts
out
of
capital
thing
it
would
be
said
phil
philosophically
for
some
of
us
have
been
going
a
pace
compton
said
dennistoun
solemnly
i
do
understand
very
well
what
you
mean
by
these
phrases
they
may
be
much
more
innocent
than
they
seem
to
a
country
lady
ears
but
i
implore
you
to
keep
my
elinor
clear
of
anything
that
you
call
going
the
pace
it
must
mean
something
very
unlike
her
whatever
it
means
she
has
been
used
to
a
very
quiet
orderly
life
do
hurry
her
off
into
a
whirl
of
society
or
among
noisy
gay
people
indeed
i
can
assure
you
that
the
more
you
have
her
to
herself
the
more
you
will
be
happy
in
her
she
is
the
brightest
companion
the
most
entertaining
oh
mr
compton
i
think
it
about
time
now
mater
to
call
me
phil
she
smiled
with
the
tears
in
her
eyes
and
held
out
her
hand
philip
then
she
said
to
make
a
little
difference
now
remember
what
i
say
it
is
only
in
the
sacredness
of
her
home
that
you
will
know
what
is
in
elinor
one
is
never
dull
with
her
she
has
her
own
opinions
her
bright
way
of
looking
at
things
as
you
know
it
is
perhaps
a
strange
thing
for
a
mother
to
say
but
she
will
amuse
you
philip
she
is
such
company
you
will
never
be
dull
with
elinor
she
has
so
much
in
her
which
will
come
out
in
society
it
is
true
but
never
so
brightly
as
between
you
two
alone
this
did
not
seem
to
have
quite
the
effect
upon
the
which
the
mother
intended
perhaps
she
said
to
herself
he
was
a
little
affected
by
the
thought
which
she
kept
so
completely
out
of
the
conversation
of
the
loss
she
herself
was
about
to
undergo
at
all
events
his
face
was
not
so
bright
as
in
the
vision
of
that
sweet
prospect
held
before
him
it
ought
to
have
been
the
fact
is
he
said
she
knows
a
great
deal
more
than
i
do
or
ever
will
it
she
that
will
be
the
one
to
look
blue
when
she
finds
herself
alone
with
a
fool
of
a
follow
that
does
know
a
book
from
a
brick
that
the
thing
i
most
afraid
as
for
society
she
can
have
her
pick
of
that
he
added
brightening
up
i
not
bind
her
down
you
may
be
sure
she
prefer
you
to
all
the
world
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
a
little
they
say
it
always
a
leap
in
the
dark
he
said
for
how
she
to
know
the
sort
of
fellow
i
am
with
what
she
sees
of
me
here
but
i
promise
you
i
do
my
best
to
take
her
in
and
keep
her
in
that
delusion
for
her
good
making
believe
to
be
all
that
virtuous
and
perhaps
not
a
bad
way
some
of
it
may
stick
come
mater
do
look
so
horrified
i
not
of
the
cousin
john
sort
but
there
may
be
something
decent
in
me
after
all
i
am
sure
said
dennistoun
that
you
will
try
to
make
her
happy
philip
she
was
crying
by
this
time
which
was
a
thing
very
odious
to
phil
he
took
her
by
both
hands
and
gave
her
a
hearty
kiss
which
was
a
thing
for
which
she
was
not
at
all
prepared
i
do
by
her
he
said
with
a
murmur
which
sounded
like
an
oath
as
well
as
i
know
how
perhaps
this
was
not
the
very
greatest
comfort
to
her
mother
but
it
was
the
best
she
was
at
all
likely
to
get
from
a
man
so
entirely
different
in
all
ways
from
her
own
species
she
had
her
cry
out
quietly
while
he
went
off
to
get
his
bag
the
pony
carriage
was
at
the
door
in
which
elinor
was
to
drive
him
to
the
station
and
a
minute
after
dennistoun
heard
his
voice
in
the
hall
calling
to
his
nell
his
old
girl
in
terms
which
went
against
all
the
mother
prejudices
of
soft
and
reverent
speech
to
have
her
child
her
elinor
whom
every
one
had
praised
and
honoured
her
so
high
apart
from
all
such
familiarity
addressed
so
gave
the
lady
a
pang
it
meant
nothing
but
love
and
kindness
she
said
to
herself
he
reverenced
elinor
as
much
as
it
was
in
such
a
man
to
do
he
meant
with
all
his
heart
to
do
by
her
as
well
as
he
knew
how
it
was
as
fantastic
to
object
to
his
natural
language
as
it
would
be
to
object
to
a
frenchman
speaking
french
that
was
his
tongue
the
only
utterance
he
knew
she
dried
her
eyes
and
went
out
to
the
door
to
see
them
start
the
sun
was
blazing
over
all
the
brilliant
autumnal
colours
of
the
garden
though
it
was
still
full
and
brilliant
summer
in
the
september
morning
and
only
the
asters
and
dahlias
replacing
the
roses
betrayed
the
turn
of
the
season
and
nothing
could
be
more
bright
than
the
face
of
elinor
as
she
sat
in
the
homely
little
carriage
with
the
reins
gathered
up
in
her
hand
he
was
going
away
indeed
but
in
a
week
he
was
coming
back
philip
as
dennistoun
now
called
him
with
dignity
yet
a
little
beginning
of
affection
packed
up
his
long
limbs
as
well
as
he
could
in
the
small
space
i
believe
she
spill
us
on
the
road
he
said
or
bring
back
the
shandrydan
with
a
hole
in
it
there
is
too
much
of
you
phil
said
elinor
giving
the
staid
pony
a
quiet
touch
i
should
like
some
of
those
fellows
to
see
me
he
said
joggled
off
to
market
like
a
basket
of
eggs
but
do
smash
me
nell
on
the
way
dennistoun
stood
on
the
steps
looking
after
them
or
rather
listening
after
them
for
they
had
soon
turned
the
corner
of
the
house
and
were
gone
she
heard
them
jogging
over
the
stony
road
and
the
sound
of
their
voices
in
the
air
for
a
long
time
after
they
were
out
of
sight
the
air
was
so
still
and
so
close
nothing
in
it
to
break
the
sound
the
atmosphere
was
all
sunshine
not
a
cloud
upon
the
sky
scarcely
a
breath
stirring
over
those
which
had
almost
the
effect
of
a
mountainous
landscape
being
the
highest
ground
in
all
the
visible
space
along
the
other
side
of
the
combe
where
the
road
became
visible
there
were
gleams
of
heather
brilliant
under
the
dark
foliage
of
the
firs
she
sat
down
in
the
porch
and
waited
to
see
them
pass
there
was
a
sorrowful
background
to
her
thoughts
but
for
the
moment
she
was
not
actually
sad
if
perhaps
a
little
forlorn
they
had
gone
away
leaving
her
alone
but
yet
in
an
hour
or
two
elinor
was
coming
back
time
enough
to
think
of
the
final
parting
next
week
elinor
would
go
and
would
not
return
dennistoun
held
on
by
both
hands
to
and
would
not
think
of
that
future
near
as
it
was
she
waited
in
a
hush
of
feeling
so
near
to
great
commotions
of
the
heart
and
mind
but
holding
them
at
a
distance
in
a
suspense
of
all
thought
till
the
shandrydan
appeared
in
the
opening
of
the
road
they
were
thinking
of
her
for
she
saw
a
gleam
of
white
the
waving
of
a
handkerchief
as
the
little
carriage
trundled
along
the
road
and
for
a
moment
the
tears
again
blinded
her
eyes
but
dennistoun
was
very
reasonable
she
got
up
from
the
cottage
porch
after
the
pony
carriage
had
passed
in
the
distance
with
that
determination
to
make
the
best
of
it
which
is
the
inspiration
of
so
many
women
lives
and
what
a
drive
the
others
had
through
the
sunshine
or
at
least
elinor
you
can
never
tell
by
what
shadows
a
man
thoughts
may
be
haunted
who
is
a
man
of
the
world
and
has
had
many
other
things
to
occupy
him
besides
this
vision
of
love
but
the
girl
had
no
shadows
the
parting
which
was
before
her
was
not
near
enough
to
harm
as
yet
and
she
was
still
able
to
think
in
her
ignorance
of
the
world
that
even
parting
was
much
more
in
appearance
than
in
reality
and
that
she
would
always
be
running
home
always
going
upon
long
visits
brightening
everything
instead
of
saddening
but
even
had
she
been
going
to
the
end
of
the
world
with
her
husband
next
week
elinor
would
still
have
been
happy
the
sunshine
itself
was
enough
to
go
to
any
one
head
and
the
pony
stepped
out
so
that
phil
had
the
grace
to
be
ashamed
of
his
reflections
upon
the
old
girl
they
got
to
the
station
too
early
for
the
train
and
had
half
an
hour
stroll
together
with
all
the
railway
porters
looking
on
admiring
they
all
knew
miss
dennistoun
from
her
childhood
and
they
were
interested
in
her
young
man
and
to
think
you
will
be
in
ireland
said
elinor
over
the
sea
with
the
channel
between
us
in
another
island
i
do
see
much
that
wonderful
in
that
said
phil
the
boat
goes
every
day
oh
there
nothing
wonderful
about
the
boat
hundreds
might
go
and
i
should
mind
but
you
it
strange
to
think
of
your
going
off
into
a
world
i
do
know
at
all
and
then
coming
back
to
take
you
off
to
that
world
you
do
know
nell
and
then
the
time
will
come
when
you
will
know
it
as
well
as
i
do
and
more
too
and
be
able
to
set
me
down
in
my
proper
place
what
is
your
proper
place
your
place
will
always
be
the
same
phil
you
been
so
good
to
me
this
time
you
made
everybody
like
you
so
mamma
that
the
best
of
all
she
was
a
little
i
ca
say
jealous
that
is
not
the
right
word
but
uncertain
and
frightened
which
just
means
that
she
did
not
know
you
phil
now
you
condescended
to
let
yourself
be
known
have
i
nell
i
had
more
luck
than
meaning
if
that
so
is
that
you
condescended
to
let
yourself
be
known
a
man
has
such
odious
pride
he
likes
to
show
himself
all
on
the
wrong
side
to
brave
people
opinions
as
if
it
was
better
to
be
liked
for
the
badness
in
you
than
for
the
goodness
in
you
what
the
goodness
in
me
nell
i
like
to
know
and
then
i
can
have
it
ready
in
other
emergencies
and
serve
it
out
as
it
is
wanted
oh
phil
the
goodness
in
you
is
yourself
you
ca
help
being
nice
when
you
throw
off
those
society
airs
when
you
are
talking
with
mariamne
and
all
that
set
of
people
why
ca
you
call
her
jew
life
is
too
short
to
say
all
those
syllables
i
do
like
you
to
call
her
jew
it
unkind
i
do
think
she
deserves
it
it
a
sort
of
an
insult
shut
up
nell
it
her
name
and
that
enough
it
a
beast
of
a
name
to
begin
with
and
do
you
think
any
of
us
has
got
time
to
say
as
much
as
that
for
one
woman
oh
i
suppose
i
fond
of
her
as
men
are
of
their
sisters
she
is
not
a
bad
sort
mean
as
her
name
and
never
fond
of
parting
with
her
money
but
stands
by
a
fellow
in
a
kind
of
a
way
all
the
same
i
never
call
her
jew
said
elinor
and
phil
all
this
wonderful
amount
of
things
you
have
to
do
is
simply
nothing
what
do
you
ever
do
it
is
the
people
who
do
things
that
have
time
to
spare
i
know
one
do
come
down
on
me
nell
again
with
that
eternal
cousin
john
phil
i
never
think
of
him
till
you
put
him
into
my
head
i
was
thinking
of
a
gentleman
who
writes
rubbish
nell
what
have
i
to
do
with
men
that

sort

do
what
my
set

more
for
there
was
this
director
business
and
i
should
never
mind
a
bit
of
work
that
was
well
paid
like
attending
board
meetings
and
so
forth
or
signing
my
name
to
papers

without
reading
them
phil
do
come
over
a
fellow
with
your
cleverness
nell
i
am
not
a
reader
but
i
should
take
good
care
i
knew
what
was
in
the
papers
before
i
signed
them
i
can
tell
you
eh
you
like
me
to
slave
to
get
you
luxuries
you
little
exacting
nell
yes
phil
she
said
i
like
to
think
you
were
working
for
our
living
i
should
indeed
it
seems
somehow
so
much
finer
so
real
a
life
and
i
should
work
at
home
a
great
deal
you
would
work
he
said
laughing
with
those
scraps
of
fingers
let
hear
what
you
would
do
bits
of
little
pictures
or
impossible
things
in
pincushions
or
so
forth
and
walk
out
in
your
most
becoming
bonnet
to
force
them
down
some
poor
throat
phil
she
said
how
contemptuous
you
are
of
my
efforts
but
i
never
thought
of
either
sketches
or
pincushions
i
should
work
at
home
to
keep
the
house
nice
to
look
after
the
servants
and
guide
the
cook
and
see
that
you
had
nice
dinners
and
warm
my
slippers
by
the
parlour
fire
said
phil
that
too
domestic
nell
for
you
and
me
but
we
are
going
to
be
very
domestic
phil
are
we
not
if
i
knows
it
yawn
our
heads
off
and
get
to
hate
one
another
not
for
me
nell
you
find
yourself
up
to
the
eyes
in
engagements
before
you
know
where
you
are
no
no
old
girl
you
may
do
a
deal
with
me
but
you
do
make
a
domestic
man
of
phil
compton
time
enough
for
that
when
we
had
our
fling
i
do
want
any
fling
phil
she
said
clinging
a
little
closer
to
his
arm
but
i
do
my
pet
in
the
person
of
benedick
the
married
man
do
you
think
i
want
to
show
all
the
fellows
what
a
stunning
little
wife
got
and
all
the
women
i
used
to
flirt
with
did
you
use
to
flirt
much
with
them
phil
you
did
think
i
flirted
with
the
men
did
you
like
you
did
said
phil
who
was
not
particular
about
his
grammar
i
want
to
show
you
off
a
bit
nell
when
we
go
down
to
the
governor
there
you
can
be
as
domestic
as
you
like
that
the
line
to
take
with
him
and
pays
too
if
you
do
it
well
oh
do
talk
as
if
you
were
always
calculating
for
your
advantage
she
said
for
you
are
not
phil
you
are
not
a
prudent
person
but
a
horrid
extravagant
spendthrift
if
you
go
on
chucking
sovereigns
about
as
you
did
yesterday
well
he
said
laughing
was
it
well
spent
did
i
make
your
rector
open
his
old
eyes
and
stop
the
mouths
of
the
old
maids
i
throw
away
sovereigns
in
a
general
way
nell
only
when
there
a
purpose
in
it
but
i
think
i
did
them
all
finely
that
time
had
them
on
toast
eh
you
made
an
impression
if
that
is
what
you
mean
but
i
confess
i
thought
you
did
it
out
of
kindness
phil
to
the
punch
and
judy
catch
me
sovereigns
ai
plentiful
enough
for
that
you
little
exacting
thing
ai
you
pleased
when
i
did
it
to
please
you
and
get
you
credit
among
your
friends
it
was
very
kind
of
you
i
sure
phil
she
said
very
soberly
but
i
should
so
much
rather
you
had
not
thought
of
that
a
shilling
would
have
done
just
as
well
and
they
would
have
got
a
bed
at
the
head
and
been
quite
kindly
treated
is
this
your
train
coming
it
a
little
too
soon
i
think
thanks
for
the
compliment
nell
it
is
really
late
he
said
looking
at
his
watch
but
the
time
flies
do
it
pet
when
you
and
i
are
together
here
you
fellow
put
my
bag
in
a
smoking
carriage
and
now
you
darling
we
got
to
part
only
for
a
little
time
nell
only
for
a
week
she
said
with
a
smile
and
a
tear
not
so
long
a
rush
along
the
rail
a
blow
on
the
sea
and
then
back
again
i
shall
only
be
a
day
over
there
and
then
bless
you
nell
take
care
of
yourself
my
little
duck
take
care
of
yourself
for
me
said
elinor
with
a
little
quiver
of
her
lip
a
parting
at
a
roadside
station
is
a
very
abrupt
affair
the
train
stops
the
passenger
is
shoved
in
there
is
a
clanging
of
the
doors
and
in
a
moment
it
is
gone
she
had
scarcely
realized
that
the
hour
had
come
before
he
was
whirled
off
from
her
and
the
swinging
line
of
carriages
disappeared
round
the
next
curve
she
stood
looking
vaguely
after
it
till
the
old
porter
came
up
who
had
known
her
ever
since
she
was
a
child
beg
your
pardon
miss
but
the
pony
is
he
said
and
then
he
uttered
his
sympathy
in
the
form
of
a
question
coming
back
very
soon
miss
ai
the
gentleman
he
said
oh
yes
very
soon
she
said
rousing
herself
up
and
if
i
may
make
bold
to
say
it
miss
said
the
porter
an
gentleman
as
ever
i
see
there
many
as
gives
us
a
threepenny
for
more
than
i
done
for
and
look
at
what
he
give
me
he
said
showing
the
in
his
hand
did
he
do
that
from
calculation
to
please
her
ungracious
girl
as
she
was
who
was
so
hard
to
please
but
he
never
could
have
known
that
she
would
see
it
she
walked
through
the
little
station
to
the
pony
carriage
feeling
that
all
the
eyes
of
the
people
about
were
upon
her
they
were
all
sympathetic
all
equally
aware
that
she
had
just
parted
with
her
lover
all
ready
to
cheer
her
if
she
had
given
them
an
opportunity
by
reminding
her
of
his
early
return
the
old
porter
followed
her
out
and
assisted
at
her
ascent
into
the
pony
carriage
he
said
solemnly
and
an
gentleman
miss
as
ever
i
see
as
he
fastened
the
apron
over
her
feet
she
gave
him
a
friendly
nod
as
she
drove
away
how
dreadful
it
is
to
be
so
sensitive
to
receive
a
wound
so
easily
elinor
was
vexed
more
than
she
could
say
by
her
lover
denial
of
the
reckless
generosity
with
which
she
had
credited
him
to
think
that
he
had
done
it
in
order
to
produce
the
effect
which
had
given
her
so
distinct
a
sensation
of
pleasure
changed
that
effect
into
absolute
pain
and
yet
in
the
fantastic
susceptibility
of
her
nature
there
was
something
in
old
judkin
which
soothed
her
again
a
shilling
would
have
been
generous
elinor
said
to
herself
with
a
feminine
appreciation
of
the
difference
of
small
things
as
well
as
great
whereas
was
lavish
ergo
he
gave
the
sovereign
also
out
of
natural
prodigality
as
she
had
hoped
not
out
of
calculation
as
he
said
she
drove
soberly
home
thinking
over
all
these
things
in
a
mood
very
different
from
that
triumphant
happiness
with
which
she
started
from
the
cottage
with
phil
by
her
side
the
sunshine
was
still
as
bright
but
it
had
taken
an
air
of
routine
and
commonplace
to
elinor
it
had
come
to
be
only
the
common
day
not
the
glory
and
freshness
of
the
morning
she
felt
herself
as
she
had
never
done
before
on
the
edge
of
a
world
unknown
where
everything
would
be
new
to
her
where
it
was
possible
that
which
awaited
her
might
not
be
unmixed
happiness
might
even
be
the
reverse
it
is
seldom
that
a
girl
on
the
eve
of
marriage
either
thinks
this
or
acknowledges
to
herself
that
she
thinks
it
elinor
did
so
involuntarily
without
thinking
upon
her
thought
perhaps
it
would
not
be
unmixed
happiness
strange
clouds
seemed
to
hang
upon
the
horizon
ready
to
roll
up
in
tragic
darkness
and
gloom
oh
no
not
tragic
only
commonplace
she
said
to
herself
opaqueness
not
blackness
but
yet
it
was
ominous
and
lowering
that
distant
sky
chapter
xiv
the
days
of
the
last
week
hurried
along
like
the
grains
of
sand
out
of
an
when
they
are
nearly
gone
it
is
true
that
almost
everything
was
done
a
few
little
bits
of
stitching
a
few
things
still
to
be
got
up
alone
remaining
a
handkerchief
to
mark
with
name
a
bit
of
lace
to
arrange
just
enough
to
keep
up
a
possibility
of
something
to
do
for
dennistoun
in
the
blank
of
all
other
possibilities
for
to
interest
herself
or
to
occupy
herself
about
anything
that
should
be
wanted
beyond
that
awful
limit
of
the
was
of
course
out
of
the
question
life
seemed
to
stop
there
for
the
mother
as
it
was
virtually
to
begin
for
the
child
though
indeed
to
elinor
also
notwithstanding
her
love
it
was
visible
more
in
the
light
of
a
point
at
which
all
the
known
and
certain
ended
and
where
the
unknown
and
almost
inconceivable
began
the
curious
thing
was
that
this
barrier
which
was
placed
across
life
for
them
both
got
somehow
between
them
in
those
last
days
which
should
have
been
the
most
tender
climax
of
their
intercourse
they
had
a
thousand
things
to
say
to
each
other
but
they
said
very
little
in
the
evening
after
dinner
whether
they
went
out
into
the
garden
together
to
watch
the
setting
of
the
young
moon
or
whether
they
sat
together
in
that
room
which
had
witnessed
all
elinor
commencements
of
life
free
to
talk
as
no
one
else
in
the
world
could
ever
talk
to
either
of
them
they
said
very
little
to
each
other
and
what
they
said
was
of
the
most
commonplace
kind
it
is
a
lovely
night
how
clear
one
can
see
the
road
on
the
other
side
of
the
combe
and
what
a
bright
star
that
is
close
to
the
moon
i
wish
i
knew
a
little
more
about
the
stars
they
are
just
as
beautiful
dennistoun
would
say
as
if
you
knew
everything
about
them
elinor
are
you
cold
mamma
i
am
sure
i
can
see
you
shiver
shall
i
run
and
get
you
a
shawl
it
is
a
little
chilly
but
perhaps
it
will
be
as
well
to
go
in
now
the
mother
said
and
then
indoors
do
you
think
you
will
like
this
lace
made
up
as
a
jabot
elinor
you
are
giving
me
all
your
pretty
things
though
you
know
you
understand
lace
much
better
than
i
do
oh
that
does
matter
dennistoun
said
hurriedly
that
is
a
taste
which
comes
with
time
you
will
like
it
as
well
as
i
do
when
you
are
as
old
as
i
am
you
are
not
so
dreadfully
old
mamma
no
the
worst
of
it
dennistoun
would
say
and
then
break
out
into
a
laugh
look
at
the
shadow
that
handkerchief
makes
how
fantastic
it
is
she
cried
she
neither
cared
for
the
moon
nor
for
the
quaintness
of
the
shadows
nor
for
the
lace
which
she
was
pulling
into
dainty
folds
to
show
its
delicate
pattern
for
none
of
all
these
things
but
for
her
only
child
who
was
going
from
her
and
to
whom
she
had
a
hundred
and
yet
a
hundred
things
to
say
but
none
of
them
ever
came
from
her
lips
mary
dale
has
not
seen
your
things
elinor
she
asked
if
she
might
come
i
think
we
might
have
had
to
ourselves
mamma
the
last
day
all
by
ourselves
before
those
people
begin
to
arrive
yes
i
think
so
too
but
it
is
difficult
to
say
no
and
as
she
was
not
here
when
the
others
came
she
is
the
greatest
critic
in
the
parish
she
will
have
so
much
to
say
i
daresay
it
may
be
fun
said
elinor
brightening
up
a
little
and
of
course
anyhow
alice
must
have
come
to
talk
about
her
dress
i
am
tired
of
those
dresses
they
are
really
of
so
little
consequence
elinor
was
not
vain
to
speak
of
but
she
thought
it
improbable
that
when
she
was
there
any
one
would
look
much
at
the
dresses
for
one
thing
to
be
sure
the
bride
is
always
the
central
figure
and
there
were
but
two
which
diminished
the
interest
and
then
well
it
had
to
be
allowed
at
the
end
of
all
that
though
her
closest
friends
neither
alice
hudson
nor
mary
tatham
were
to
look
at
very
interesting
girls
they
are
of
great
consequence
to
them
said
dennistoun
with
the
faintest
smile
i
did
mean
that
of
course
said
elinor
with
a
blush
only
i
never
should
have
worried
about
my
own
dress
which
after
all
is
the
most
important
as
alice
does
about
hers
which
nobody
will
look
at
dennistoun
said
i
did
not
say
that
but
to
tell
the
truth
it
is
a
pity
for
the
girls
that
the
men
will
not
quite
be
just
of
their
world
you
know
oh
mamma
you
know
it
is
not
that
i
think
anything
of
that
but
i
am
sorry
for
alice
and
mary
bolsover
and
the
other
gentlemen
will
not
take
that
trouble
which
country
neighbours
or
or
john
friends
from
the
temple
might
have
done
why
do
you
speak
of
john
friends
from
the
temple
elinor
mamma
for
no
reason
at
all
why
should
i
they
were
the
only
other
men
i
could
think
of
elinor
did
john
ever
give
you
any
reason
to
think
mamma
cried
elinor
again
with
double
vehemence
her
countenance
all
ablaze
of
course
he
never
did
how
could
you
think
such
foolish
things
well
my
dear
said
her
mother
i
am
very
glad
he
did
not
it
will
prevent
any
embarrassment
between
him
and
you
for
i
must
always
believe
do
please
oh
do
it
would
make
me
miserable
it
would
take
all
my
happiness
away
dennistoun
said
nothing
but
she
sighed
a
very
small
infinitesimal
sigh
and
there
was
a
moment
silence
during
which
perhaps
that
sigh
pervaded
the
atmosphere
with
a
sort
of
breath
of
what
might
have
been
after
a
moment
she
spoke
again
i
hope
you
have
not
packed
up
your
ornaments
yet
elinor
you
must
leave
them
to
the
very
last
for
mary
would
like
to
see
that
beautiful
necklace
what
do
you
think
you
shall
wear
on
the
day
nothing
said
elinor
promptly
she
was
about
to
add
i
have
nothing
good
enough
but
paused
in
time
not
my
little
star
it
would
look
very
well
my
darling
to
fix
your
veil
on
the
diamonds
are
very
good
though
perhaps
a
little
you
might
get
them
reset
but
your
father
gave
it
me
like
that
i
would
not
change
it
a
bit
mamma
for
anything
in
the
world
thanks
my
dearest
i
thought
that
was
how
you
would
feel
about
it
it
is
not
very
big
of
course
but
it
really
is
very
good
then
i
will
wear
it
mamma
if
it
will
please
you
but
nothing
else
it
would
please
me
it
would
be
like
having
something
from
your
father
i
think
we
had
less
idea
of
ornaments
in
my
day
i
can
not
tell
you
how
proud
i
was
of
my
diamond
star
i
should
like
to
put
it
in
for
you
myself
elinor
oh
mamma
this
was
the
nearest
point
they
had
come
to
that
outburst
of
two
full
hearts
which
both
of
them
would
have
called
breaking
down
dennistoun
saw
it
and
was
frightened
she
thought
it
would
be
betraying
to
elinor
what
she
wished
her
never
to
know
the
unspeakable
desolation
to
which
she
was
looking
forward
when
her
child
was
taken
from
her
elinor
exclamation
too
was
a
protest
against
the
imminent
breaking
down
they
both
came
back
with
a
hurry
with
a
panting
breath
to
safer
ground
yes
that
what
i
regret
she
said
bolsover
and
harry
compton
will
laugh
a
little
at
the
rectory
they
will
not
be
so
nice
as
young
men
of
their
own
kind
the
rectory
people
are
just
as
well
born
as
any
of
us
elinor
oh
precisely
mamma
i
know
that
but
we
too
it
is
what
they
call
a
different
i
do
think
it
is
half
so
nice
a
said
the
girl
feeling
that
she
had
gone
further
than
she
intended
to
do
but
you
know
mamma
i
know
elinor
but
i
scarcely
expected
from
you
oh
cried
elinor
again
in
exasperation
if
you
think
that
i
share
that
feeling
i
think
it
odious
i
think
their
is
vulgar
nasty
miserable
i
think
do
go
too
far
the
other
way
elinor
your
husband
will
be
of
it
and
you
must
learn
to
like
it
you
think
perhaps
all
that
is
new
to
me
no
said
elinor
her
bright
eyes
all
the
brighter
for
tears
falling
before
her
mother
look
i
know
of
course
that
you
have
seen
all
kinds
but
she
faltered
a
little
for
she
did
not
believe
that
her
mother
was
acquainted
with
phil
circle
and
their
wonderful
ways
they
will
be
civil
enough
she
went
on
hurriedly
and
as
everybody
chaffs
so
much
nowadays
they
will
perhaps
never
be
found
out
but
i
do
like
it
for
my
friends
they
will
chaff
me
also
no
doubt
dennistoun
said
oh
mamma
they
are
not
such
fools
as
that
cried
poor
elinor
but
in
her
own
mind
she
did
not
feel
confident
that
there
was
any
such
limitation
to
their
folly
dennistoun
laughed
a
little
to
herself
which
was
perhaps
more
alarming
than
that
other
moment
when
she
was
almost
ready
to
cry
you
had
better
wear
lord
serf
ring
she
said
after
a
moment
with
a
tone
of
faint
derision
which
elinor
knew
you
might
as
well
tell
me
cried
the
bride
to
wear
lady
revolving
dishes
no
i
will
wear
nothing
nothing
but
your
star
you
have
got
nothing
half
so
nice
said
the
mother
oh
yes
it
was
a
little
revenge
upon
those
people
who
were
taking
her
daughter
from
her
and
who
thought
themselves
at
liberty
to
jeer
at
all
her
friends
but
as
was
perhaps
inevitable
it
touched
elinor
a
little
too
she
restrained
herself
from
some
retort
with
a
sense
of
extreme
and
almost
indignant
though
what
retort
elinor
could
have
made
i
can
not
tell
it
was
much
nicer
than
anything
else
she
had
none
of
phil
great
friends
who
were
not
of
the
same
as
the
people
at
windyhill
had
offered
his
bride
anything
to
compare
with
the
diamonds
which
her
father
had
given
to
her
mother
before
she
was
born
and
elinor
was
quite
aware
of
the
truth
of
what
her
mother
said
but
she
would
have
liked
to
make
a
retort
to
say
something
smart
and
piquant
and
witty
in
return
and
thus
the
evening
was
lost
the
evening
in
which
there
was
so
much
to
say
one
of
the
three
only
no
more
that
were
left
miss
dale
came
next
day
to
see
the
things
and
was
very
amiable
but
the
only
thing
in
this
visit
which
affected
elinor
mind
was
a
curious
little
unexpected
assault
this
lady
made
upon
her
when
she
was
going
away
elinor
had
gone
out
with
her
to
the
porch
according
to
the
courteous
usage
of
the
house
but
when
they
had
reached
that
shady
place
from
which
the
green
combe
and
the
blue
distance
were
visible
stretching
far
into
the
soft
autumnal
mists
of
the
evening
mary
dale
turned
upon
her
and
asked
her
suddenly
what
night
was
it
that
compton
came
here
elinor
was
much
startled
but
she
did
not
lose
her
all
the
trouble
about
that
date
had
disappeared
out
of
her
mind
in
the
stress
and
urgency
of
other
things
she
cast
back
her
mind
with
an
effort
and
asked
herself
what
the
conflict
and
uncertainty
of
which
she
was
dimly
conscious
had
been
it
came
back
to
her
dimly
without
any
of
the
pain
that
had
been
in
it
it
was
on
the
sixth
she
said
quietly
without
excitement
she
could
scarcely
recall
to
her
mind
what
it
was
that
had
moved
her
so
much
in
respect
to
this
date
only
a
little
time
ago
oh
you
must
be
mistaken
elinor
i
saw
him
coming
up
from
the
station
it
was
later
than
that
it
was
if
i
were
to
give
my
life
for
it
thursday
night
this
was
four
or
five
nights
before
and
a
haze
of
uncertainty
had
fallen
on
all
things
so
remote
but
elinor
cast
her
eyes
upon
the
calendar
in
the
hall
and
calm
possessed
her
breast
it
was
the
sixth
she
said
with
composed
tones
as
certain
as
of
anything
she
had
ever
known
in
the
course
of
her
life
well
i
suppose
you
must
know
said
mary
dale
chapter
xv
look
at
that
elinor
said
dennistoun
next
day
when
she
had
read
twice
over
a
letter
large
and
emblazoned
with
a
very
big
monogram
which
elinor
well
perceiving
from
whom
it
came
had
furtively
watched
the
effect
of
from
behind
an
exceeding
small
letter
of
her
own
phil
was
not
remarkable
as
a
correspondent
his
style
was
that
of
the
primitive
mind
which
hopes
its
correspondent
is
well
as
this
leaves
me
he
had
never
much
more
to
say
from
mariamne
mamma
she
takes
great
pains
to
make
us
certain
of
that
fact
at
least
dennistoun
said
which
indeed
was
very
true
for
the
name
of
the
writer
was
sprawled
in
gilt
letters
half
over
the
sheet
and
this
was
how
it
ran
dear
dennistoun
i
have
been
thinking
what
a
great
pity
it
would
be
to
bore
you
with
me
and
my
maid
and
all
my
belongings
i
am
so
silly
that
i
can
never
be
happy
without
dragging
a
lot
of
things
about
with
me
dogs
and
people
and
so
forth
going
to
town
in
september
is
dreadful
but
it
is
rather
to
do
a
thing
that
is
quite
out
of
the
way
and
one
may
perhaps
pick
up
a
little
fun
in
the
evening
so
if
you
do
mind
instead
of
inflicting
fifine
and
bijou
and
leocadie
not
to
mention
some
people
that
might
be
with
me
upon
you
and
putting
your
house
all
out
of
order
as
these
odious
little
dogs
do
when
people
are
not
used
to
them
i
will
come
down
by
the
train
which
i
hope
arrives
quite
punctually
in
time
to
see
poor
phil
turned
off
i
am
sure
you
will
be
so
kind
as
to
send
a
carriage
for
me
to
the
railway
we
shall
be
probably
a
party
of
four
and
i
hear
from
phil
you
are
so
hospitable
and
kind
that
i
need
not
hesitate
to
bring
my
friends
to
breakfast
after
it
all
over
i
hope
phil
will
go
through
it
like
a
man
and
i
for
worlds
deprive
him
of
the
support
of
his
family
love
to
nell
i
am
yours
truly
mariamne
prestwich
the
first
name
very
big
and
the
second
very
small
said
dennistoun
as
she
received
the
letter
back
i
am
sure
we
are
much
obliged
to
her
for
not
coming
mamma
perhaps
but
not
for
this
announcement
of
her
not
coming
i
do
wish
to
say
anything
against
your
new
relations
elinor
you
need
not
put
any
restraint
upon
yourself
in
consideration
of
my
feelings
said
elinor
with
a
flush
of
annoyance
and
this
made
dennistoun
pause
they
ate
their
breakfast
which
was
a
very
light
meal
in
silence
it
was
the
day
before
the
wedding
the
rooms
had
been
carefully
prepared
for
phil
sister
though
dennistoun
was
too
proud
to
say
anything
about
it
she
had
taken
great
pains
to
make
these
pretty
rooms
as
much
like
a
fine
chamber
as
had
been
possible
she
had
put
up
new
curtains
and
a
persian
carpet
and
looked
out
of
her
stores
all
the
pretty
things
she
could
find
to
decorate
the
two
rooms
of
the
little
apartment
she
had
gone
in
on
the
way
to
take
a
final
survey
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
they
were
very
pretty
no
picture
could
have
been
more
beautiful
than
the
view
from
the
long
low
lattice
window
in
which
as
in
a
frame
was
set
the
foreground
of
the
copse
with
its
glimpses
of
ruddy
heather
and
the
long
sweep
of
the
heights
beyond
which
stretched
away
into
the
infinite
that
at
least
could
not
be
surpassed
anywhere
and
the
persian
carpet
was
like
moss
under
foot
and
the
chairs
luxurious
and
there
was
a
collection
of
old
china
in
some
open
shelves
which
would
have
made
the
mouth
of
an
amateur
water
well
it
was
lady
mariamne
own
loss
if
she
preferred
the
chance
of
picking
up
a
little
fun
in
the
evening
to
spending
the
night
decorously
in
that
pretty
apartment
and
making
further
acquaintance
with
her
new
sister
it
was
entirely
dennistoun
said
to
herself
a
matter
for
her
own
choice
but
she
was
much
affronted
all
the
same
it
will
be
very
inconvenient
indeed
sending
a
carriage
for
her
elinor
except
the
carriage
that
is
to
take
you
to
church
there
is
none
good
enough
for
this
fine
lady
i
had
concluded
she
would
go
in
your
uncle
tatham
carriage
it
may
be
very
fine
to
have
a
lady
mariamne
in
party
but
it
is
a
great
nuisance
to
have
to
change
all
arrangements
at
the
last
moment
if
you
were
to
send
the
wagonette
from
the
bull
head
as
rough
as
possible
with
two
of
the
farm
horses
she
would
think
it
if
not
i
can
not
put
up
with
all
this
nonsense
cried
dennistoun
with
a
flush
on
her
cheek
you
are
just
as
bad
as
they
are
elinor
to
suggest
such
a
thing
i
have
held
my
own
place
in
society
wherever
i
have
been
and
i
do
choose
to
be
condescended
to
or
laughed
at
in
fact
by
any
visitor
in
the
world
mamma
do
you
think
any
one
would
ever
compare
you
with
mariamne
the
jew
do
exasperate
me
with
those
abominable
nicknames
they
will
give
you
one
next
she
is
an
exceedingly
and
woman
picking
up
a
little
fun
in
the
evening
what
does
she
mean
by
picking
up
a
little
fun
they
will
perhaps
go
to
the
theatre
a
number
of
them
and
as
nobody
is
in
town
they
will
laugh
very
much
at
the
kind
of
people
and
perhaps
the
kind
of
play
and
it
will
be
a
great
joke
ever
after
among
themselves
for
of
course
there
will
be
a
number
of
them
together
said
elinor
disclosing
her
acquaintance
with
the
habits
of
her
new
family
with
downcast
eyes
how
can
people
be
so
vulgar
and
cried
dennistoun
i
must
say
for
philip
that
though
he
is
careless
and
not
nearly
so
particular
as
i
should
like
still
he
is
not
like
that
he
has
something
of
the
politeness
of
the
heart
elinor
did
not
raise
her
downcast
eyes
phil
had
been
on
his
very
good
behaviour
on
the
occasion
of
his
last
hurried
visit
but
she
did
not
feel
that
she
could
answer
even
for
phil
i
am
very
glad
anyhow
that
she
is
not
coming
mamma
at
least
we
shall
have
the
last
night
and
the
last
morning
to
ourselves
dennistoun
shook
her
head
the
tathams
will
be
here
she
said
and
everybody
to
dinner
all
the
party
we
must
go
now
and
see
how
we
can
enlarge
the
table
party
will
be
the
largest
we
have
ever
had
in
the
cottage
she
sighed
a
little
and
paused
restraining
herself
we
shall
have
no
quiet
evening
nor
morning
either
again
it
will
be
a
bustle
and
a
rush
you
and
i
will
never
have
any
more
quiet
evenings
elinor
for
when
you
come
back
it
will
be
another
thing
oh
mother
cried
elinor
throwing
herself
into
her
mother
arms
and
for
a
moment
they
stood
closely
clasped
feeling
as
if
their
hearts
would
burst
yet
very
well
aware
too
underneath
that
any
number
of
quiet
evenings
would
be
as
the
last
when
with
hearts
full
of
a
thousand
things
to
say
to
each
other
they
said
almost
nothing
which
in
some
respects
was
worse
than
having
no
quiet
evenings
evermore
in
the
afternoon
phil
arrived
having
returned
from
ireland
that
morning
and
paused
only
to
refresh
himself
in
the
chambers
which
he
still
retained
in
town
he
had
met
all
his
hunting
friends
during
the
three
days
he
had
been
away
and
though
he
retained
a
gallant
appearance
and
looked
as
alice
hudson
thought
very
aristocratic
dennistoun
caught
with
anxiety
a
look
the
look
of
excitement
of
nights
without
sleep
much
smoke
and
perhaps
much
wine
in
his
eyes
what
a
woman
feels
who
has
to
hand
over
her
spotless
child
the
most
dear
and
pure
thing
upon
earth
to
a
man
fresh
from
those
indulgences
and
dissipations
which
never
seem
harmless
and
always
are
repellent
to
a
woman
is
not
to
be
described
fortunately
the
bride
herself
in
invincible
ignorance
and
unconsciousness
seldom
feels
in
that
way
to
elinor
her
lover
looked
tired
about
the
eyes
which
was
very
well
explained
by
his
night
journey
and
by
the
agitation
of
the
moment
and
indeed
she
did
not
see
very
much
of
phil
who
had
his
friends
with
him
his
bolsover
and
his
brother
harry
these
three
gentlemen
carried
an
atmosphere
of
smoke
and
other
scents
with
them
into
the
lavender
of
the
rectory
which
was
too
amazing
in
that
hemisphere
for
words
and
talked
their
own
talk
in
the
midst
of
the
fringe
of
rustics
who
were
their
hosts
with
a
calm
which
was
extraordinary
breaking
into
the
midst
of
the
rector
amiable
sentences
and
talking
to
each
other
over
hudson
head
i
say
dick
do
you
remember
by
jove
phil
you
are
too
bad
sounded
with
many
other
such
expressions
and
reminders
over
the
rectory
party
strictly
silent
round
their
own
table
trying
to
make
a
courteous
remark
now
and
then
but
confounded
in
their
simple
country
good
manners
by
the
fine
gentlemen
and
then
there
was
the
at
the
cottage
in
the
evening
to
which
and
hudson
were
invited
such
a
old
tatham
who
was
a
country
gentleman
from
dorsetshire
with
his
nice
daughter
mary
tatham
a
quiet
country
young
lady
accustomed
when
she
went
into
the
world
at
all
to
the
serious
young
men
of
the
temple
and
john
friends
who
had
their
own
asides
about
cases
and
what
had
said
in
court
but
were
much
too
before
ladies
to
fall
into
shop
and
and
hudson
who
were
such
as
we
know
them
and
the
bride
mother
a
little
anxious
but
always
debonair
and
elinor
herself
in
all
the
haze
and
sweet
confusion
of
the
great
era
which
approached
so
closely
the
three
men
made
the
strangest
addition
that
can
be
conceived
to
the
quiet
guests
but
things
went
better
under
the
discipline
of
the
dinner
especially
as
sir
john
huntingtower
who
was
a
master
of
the
hounds
and
an
old
friend
of
the
dennistouns
was
of
the
party
and
lady
huntingtower
who
was
an
impressive
person
and
knew
the
world
this
lady
was
very
warm
in
her
congratulations
to
dennistoun
after
dinner
on
the
absence
of
lady
mariamne
i
think
you
are
the
luckiest
woman
that
ever
was
to
have
got
clear
of
that
dreadful
creature
she
said
oh
there
is
nothing
wrong
about
her
that
i
know
she
goes
everywhere
with
her
dogs
and
her
there
safety
in
numbers
my
dear
she
has
always
two
of
them
at
least
hanging
about
her
to
fetch
and
carry
and
she
thinks
a
great
deal
more
of
her
dogs
but
i
ca
think
what
you
could
have
done
with
her
here
and
what
will
my
elinor
do
in
such
a
sphere
the
troubled
mother
permitted
herself
to
say
oh
if
that
were
all
said
lady
huntingtower
lifting
up
her
fat
hands
she
was
one
of
those
who
had
protested
against
the
marriage
but
now
that
it
had
come
to
this
point
and
could
not
be
broken
off
the
judicious
woman
thought
it
right
to
make
the
best
of
it
elinor
need
not
be
any
the
worse
she
said
thank
heaven
you
are
not
obliged
to
be
mixed
up
with
your
husband
sister
elinor
must
take
a
line
of
her
own
you
should
come
to
town
yourself
her
first
season
and
help
her
on
you
used
to
know
plenty
of
people
but
they
say
said
dennistoun
that
it
is
so
much
better
to
leave
a
young
couple
to
themselves
and
that
a
mother
is
always
in
the
way
if
i
were
you
i
would
not
pay
the
least
attention
to
what
they
say
if
you
hold
back
too
much
they
will
say
was
her
own
mother
knowing
numbers
of
nice
people
that
never
took
the
trouble
to
lend
her
a
hand
i
hope
said
dennistoun
turning
round
immediately
to
this
other
aspect
of
affairs
that
it
never
will
be
necessary
for
the
world
to
interest
itself
at
all
in
my
child
affairs
well
of
course
that
is
the
best
lady
huntingtower
allowed
if
she
just
goes
softly
for
a
year
or
two
till
she
feels
her
way
but
then
she
is
so
young
and
so
little
accustomed
to
act
for
herself
said
the
mother
with
another
change
of
flank
oh
elinor
has
a
great
deal
of
spirit
she
must
just
make
a
stand
against
the
compton
set
and
take
her
own
line
hudson
and
alice
and
miss
tatham
were
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
exchanging
a
few
criticisms
under
their
breath
and
disposed
to
think
that
they
were
neglected
by
their
hostess
for
the
greater
personage
with
whom
she
was
in
such
close
conversation
and
lady
mariamne
defection
was
a
great
disappointment
to
them
all
i
should
like
to
have
seen
a
fine
lady
quite
close
said
mary
it
was
not
i
think
usual
to
speak
of
smart
people
in
those
days
one
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
a
little
fast
and
all
that
i
have
seen
them
in
town
at
a
distance
but
all
the
people
we
know
are
sure
country
people
my
dear
said
hudson
primly
i
do
like
to
hear
you
talk
of
any
other
kind
an
english
lady
i
hope
whatever
is
her
rank
can
only
be
of
one
kind
oh
mamma
you
know
very
well
lady
mariamne
is
as
different
from
lady
huntingtower
as
do
mention
names
my
dear
it
is
not
the
one
is
young
and
naturally
fond
of
gayety
the
other
well
is
not
quite
so
young
and
stout
and
all
that
oh
that
is
all
very
well
said
alice
but
aunt
mary
says
miss
dale
was
coming
in
the
evening
and
the
miss
hills
and
the
curate
and
the
doctor
and
various
other
people
who
could
not
be
asked
to
dinner
to
whom
it
had
been
carefully
explained
which
indeed
was
a
fact
they
knew
that
to
dine
twelve
people
in
the
little
of
the
cottage
was
a
feat
which
was
accomplished
with
difficulty
and
that
more
was
impossible
society
at
windyhill
was
very
tolerant
and
understanding
on
this
point
for
all
the
were
small
except
indeed
when
you
come
to
talk
of
such
places
as
huntingtower
and
they
were
very
glad
to
be
permitted
to
have
a
peep
at
the
bridegroom
on
these
terms
or
rather
if
truth
were
told
of
the
bride
and
how
she
was
bearing
herself
so
near
the
crisis
of
her
fate
the
bridegroom
is
seldom
very
interesting
on
such
occasions
on
the
present
occasion
he
was
more
interesting
than
usual
because
he
was
the
honourable
philip
and
because
he
had
a
reputation
of
which
most
people
had
heard
something
there
was
a
mixture
of
alarm
and
suspicion
in
respect
to
him
which
increased
the
excitement
and
many
remarks
of
varied
kinds
were
made
i
think
the
fellow
face
quite
bears
out
his
character
said
the
doctor
to
the
rector
what
a
man
to
trust
a
nice
girl
to
hudson
felt
that
as
the
bridegroom
was
living
under
his
roof
he
was
partially
responsible
and
discouraged
this
pessimistic
view
compton
has
not
perhaps
had
all
the
advantages
one
tries
to
secure
for
one
own
son
he
said
but
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
the
things
that
have
been
said
of
him
are
much
exaggerated
oh
advantages
said
the
doctor
thinking
of
alick
of
whom
it
was
his
strongly
expressed
opinion
that
the
fellow
should
be
turned
out
to
rough
it
and
not
coddled
up
and
spoiled
at
home
but
while
these
remarks
were
going
on
miss
hill
had
been
expressing
to
the
curate
an
entirely
different
view
i
think
he
has
a
face
she
said
with
the
emphasis
some
ladies
use
a
little
worn
perhaps
with
being
too
much
in
the
world
and
i
wish
he
had
a
better
colour
to
me
he
looks
delicate
but
what
delightful
features
whitebands
and
what
an
aristocratic
air
he
looks
tremendously
up
to
everything
the
curate
said
with
a
faint
tone
of
envy
in
his
voice
do
he
just
cried
alick
hudson
i
should
think
there
was
a
thing
he
could
do
of
things
that
men
do
do
you
know
cried
that
carefully
trained
boy
whose
style
was
confused
though
his
meaning
was
good
but
probably
there
were
almost
as
many
opinions
about
phil
as
there
were
people
in
the
room
his
two
stood
in
a
corner
half
intimidated
half
contemptuous
of
the
country
people
queer
lot
for
phil
to
fall
among
said
dick
bolsover
que
diable
faire
dans
cette
galère
said
harry
compton
who
had
been
about
the
world
oh
bosh
with
your
french
that
nobody
understands
said
the
best
man
but
in
the
meantime
phil
was
not
there
at
all
to
be
seen
of
men
he
had
stolen
out
into
the
garden
where
there
was
a
white
vision
awaiting
him
in
the
milky
moonlight
the
autumn
haze
had
come
early
this
season
and
the
moon
was
misty
veiled
with
white
amid
a
jumble
of
soft
floating
vapours
in
the
sky
elinor
stood
among
the
flowers
which
showed
some
strange
subdued
tints
of
colours
in
the
flooding
of
the
white
light
like
a
bit
of
consolidated
moonlight
in
her
white
dress
she
had
a
white
shawl
covering
her
from
head
to
foot
with
a
corner
thrown
over
her
hair
what
had
they
to
say
to
each
other
that
last
night
not
much
nothing
at
all
that
had
any
information
in
it
whispers
inaudible
almost
to
each
other
there
was
something
in
being
together
for
this
stolen
moment
just
on
the
eve
of
their
being
together
for
always
which
had
a
charm
of
its
own
after
no
stealing
away
no
escape
to
the
garden
no
little
conspiracy
to
attain
a
meeting
the
last
of
all
those
delightful
schemings
and
devices
they
started
when
they
heard
a
sound
from
the
house
and
sped
along
the
paths
into
the
shadow
like
the
conspirators
they
were
but
never
to
conspire
more
after
this
last
enthralling
time
you
not
frightened
nell
no
except
a
little
there
is
one
thing
what
is
it
my
pet
if
it
to
the
half
of
my
kingdom
it
shall
be
done
phil
we
are
going
to
be
very
good
when
we
are
together
laugh
to
help
each
other
he
did
laugh
low
not
to
be
heard
but
long
i
shall
have
no
temptation
he
said
to
be
anything
but
good
you
little
goose
of
a
nell
taking
it
for
a
warning
of
possible
jealousy
to
come
oh
but
i
mean
both
of
us
to
help
each
other
why
nell
i
know
you
never
go
wrong
she
gave
him
a
little
impatient
shake
you
will
not
understand
me
phil
we
will
try
to
be
better
than
we
ever
been
to
be
good
you
know
what
that
means
in
every
way
before
god
her
voice
dropped
very
low
and
he
was
for
a
moment
overawed
you
mean
going
to
church
nell
i
mean
yes
that
for
one
thing
and
many
other
things
that
dropping
rather
strong
upon
a
fellow
he
said
just
at
this
moment
do
you
think
when
i
must
say
yes
to
everything
you
say
oh
i
do
mean
it
in
that
way
and
i
was
not
thinking
of
church
particularly
but
to
be
good
very
good
true
and
kind
in
our
hearts
you
are
all
that
already
nell
oh
no
not
what
i
mean
when
there
are
two
of
us
instead
of
one
we
can
do
so
much
more
well
my
pet
it
for
you
to
make
out
the
much
more
i
quite
content
with
you
as
you
are
it
me
that
you
want
to
improve
and
heaven
knows
there
plenty
of
room
for
that
no
phil
not
you
more
than
me
she
said
we
choose
a
place
where
the
sermon
short
and
we
see
about
it
you
mean
little
minx
to
bind
a
man
down
to
go
to
church
the
night
before
his
wedding
day
and
then
there
was
a
sound
of
movement
indoors
and
after
a
little
while
the
bride
appeared
among
the
guests
with
a
little
more
colour
than
usual
and
an
anxiously
explanatory
description
of
something
she
had
been
obliged
to
do
and
the
confused
hour
flew
on
with
much
sound
of
talking
and
very
little
understanding
of
what
was
said
and
then
all
the
visitors
streamed
away
group
after
group
into
the
moonlight
disappearing
like
ghosts
under
the
shadow
of
the
trees
finally
the
rectory
party
went
too
the
three
mild
ladies
surrounded
by
an
exciting
circle
of
cigars
for
alick
of
course
had
broken
all
bonds
and
even
the
rector
accepted
that
rare
indulgence
alice
hudson
half
deplored
half
exulted
for
years
after
in
the
scent
that
would
cling
round
one
particular
evening
dress
five
gentlemen
all
with
cigars
and
papa
as
bad
as
any
of
them
there
had
never
been
such
an
extraordinary
experience
in
her
life
and
then
the
tathams
too
withdrew
and
the
mother
and
daughter
stood
alone
on
their
own
hearth
oh
so
much
so
much
as
there
was
to
say
but
how
were
they
to
say
it
the
last
moment
which
was
so
precious
and
so
intolerable
the
moment
that
would
never
come
again
you
were
a
long
time
with
philip
elinor
in
the
garden
i
think
all
your
old
friends
the
last
night
i
wanted
to
say
something
to
him
mamma
that
i
had
never
had
the
courage
to
say
dennistoun
had
been
looking
dully
into
the
dim
mirror
over
the
mantelpiece
she
turned
half
round
to
her
daughter
with
an
inquiring
look
oh
mamma
i
wanted
to
say
to
him
that
we
must
be
good
we
so
happy
god
is
so
kind
to
us
and
you
if
you
suppose
i
do
think
of
you
it
was
to
say
to
him
building
our
house
upon
all
this
god
mercy
and
your
loss
and
all
that
we
are
doubly
doubly
bound
to
serve
and
to
love
and
to
be
good
people
before
god
and
like
you
mother
like
you
my
darling
dennistoun
said
and
that
was
all
she
asked
no
questions
as
to
how
it
was
to
be
done
or
what
he
replied
elinor
had
broken
down
hysterically
and
sobbed
out
the
words
one
at
a
time
as
they
would
come
through
the
choking
in
her
throat
needless
to
say
that
she
ended
in
her
mother
arms
her
head
upon
the
bosom
which
had
nursed
her
her
slight
weight
dependent
upon
the
supporter
and
protector
of
all
her
life
that
was
the
last
evening
there
remained
the
last
morning
to
come
and
after
that
what
the
great
sea
of
an
unknown
life
a
new
pilot
and
a
ship
untried
chapter
xvi
and
now
the
last
morning
had
come
the
morning
of
a
is
a
flying
and
precarious
moment
which
seems
at
once
as
if
it
never
would
end
and
as
if
it
were
a
hurried
preliminary
interval
in
which
the
necessary
preparations
never
could
be
done
elinor
was
not
allowed
to
come
to
help
as
she
felt
it
would
be
natural
to
do
it
was
mary
tatham
who
arranged
the
flowers
on
the
table
and
helped
dennistoun
to
superintend
everything
all
the
women
in
the
house
though
they
were
so
busy
were
devoted
at
every
spare
moment
to
the
service
of
elinor
they
brought
her
simple
breakfast
one
maid
carrying
the
tray
and
another
the
teapot
that
each
might
have
their
share
the
cook
though
she
was
overwhelmed
with
work
had
made
some
cakes
for
breakfast
such
us
elinor
liked
most
like
as
we
never
have
her
no
more
to
mind
she
said
the
gardener
sent
up
an
untidy
bundle
of
white
flowers
and
dennistoun
came
herself
to
pour
out
the
tea
as
if
i
had
been
ill
or
had
turned
into
a
baby
again
elinor
said
but
there
was
not
much
said
mary
tatham
was
there
for
one
thing
and
for
another
and
the
most
important
they
had
said
all
they
had
to
say
the
rest
which
remained
could
not
be
said
the
wedding
was
to
be
at
a
quarter
to
twelve
in
order
to
give
lady
mariamne
time
to
come
from
town
it
was
not
the
fashion
then
to
delay
marriages
to
the
afternoon
which
no
doubt
would
have
been
much
more
convenient
for
her
ladyship
but
the
best
that
could
be
done
was
done
carriage
which
he
had
brought
with
him
to
grace
the
ceremony
was
despatched
to
the
station
to
meet
lady
mariamne
while
he
good
man
had
to
get
to
church
as
he
could
in
one
of
the
flys
and
then
came
the
important
moment
when
the
dressing
of
the
bride
had
to
be
begun
the
was
not
yet
all
set
out
in
perfect
order
and
there
were
many
things
to
do
yet
every
woman
in
the
house
had
a
little
share
in
the
dressing
of
the
bride
they
all
came
to
see
how
it
fitted
when
the
was
put
on
it
fitted
like
a
glove
the
long
glossy
folds
of
the
satin
were
a
wonder
to
see
cook
stood
just
within
the
door
in
a
white
apron
and
wept
and
could
not
say
a
word
to
miss
elinor
but
the
younger
maids
sent
forth
a
murmur
of
admiration
and
the
missis
they
thought
was
almost
as
beautiful
as
the
bride
though
her
satin
was
grey
dennistoun
herself
threw
the
veil
over
her
child
head
and
put
in
the
diamond
star
the
ornament
which
had
been
her
husband
present
to
herself
and
then
again
she
had
meant
to
say
something
to
elinor
a
last
word
but
the
word
would
not
come
they
were
both
of
them
glad
that
somebody
should
be
there
all
the
time
that
they
should
not
be
left
alone
and
after
that
the
strange
hurried
everlasting
morning
was
over
and
the
carriage
was
at
the
door
then
again
it
was
a
relief
that
old
tatham
had
missed
his
proper
place
in
the
fly
and
had
to
go
on
the
front
seat
with
the
bride
and
her
mother
it
was
far
better
so
if
they
had
been
left
even
for
ten
minutes
alone
who
could
have
answered
that
one
or
the
other
would
not
have
cried
and
discomposed
the
bouquet
and
the
veil
it
seemed
a
great
danger
and
responsibility
over
when
they
arrived
at
last
safely
at
the
church
door
lady
mariamne
was
just
then
arriving
from
the
station
she
drew
up
before
them
in
poor
tatham
carriage
keeping
them
back
harry
compton
and
bolsover
sprang
to
the
carriage
window
to
talk
to
her
and
there
was
a
loud
explosion
of
mirth
and
laughter
in
the
midst
of
the
village
people
and
the
children
with
their
baskets
of
flowers
who
were
already
gathered
lady
mariamne
voice
burst
out
so
shrill
that
it
overmastered
the
church
bells
here
i
am
she
cried
out
in
the
wilderness
and
algy
has
come
with
me
to
take
care
of
me
and
how
are
you
dear
boys
and
how
is
poor
phil
phil
is
all
ready
to
be
turned
off
with
the
halter
round
his
neck
said
dick
bolsover
and
harry
compton
said
hurry
up
hurry
up
jew
the
bride
is
behind
you
waiting
to
get
out
she
must
wait
then
said
lady
mariamne
and
there
came
leisurely
out
of
the
carriage
first
her
companion
by
name
algy
a
tall
person
with
an
then
a
little
pug
which
was
carefully
handed
into
his
arms
and
then
lightly
jumping
down
to
the
ground
a
little
figure
in
black
in
black
of
all
things
in
the
world
a
sight
that
curdled
the
blood
of
the
village
people
and
of
hudson
who
had
walked
across
from
the
rectory
in
a
gown
of
silk
which
scattered
prismatic
reflections
as
she
walked
in
black
hudson
bethought
herself
that
she
had
a
white
china
crape
shawl
in
her
cupboard
and
wondered
if
she
could
offer
it
to
conceal
this
ill
omened
gown
but
if
lady
mariamne
dress
was
dark
she
herself
was
fair
enough
with
an
endless
fluff
of
light
hair
under
her
little
black
lace
bonnet
her
gloves
were
off
and
her
hands
were
white
and
glistening
with
rings
give
me
my
puggy
darling
she
said
in
her
loud
shrill
tone
i
can
go
nowhere
can
i
pet
without
my
little
pug
a
jew
and
a
pug
both
in
church
it
is
enough
said
her
brother
to
get
the
poor
parson
into
trouble
with
his
bishop
oh
the
bishop
a
great
friend
of
mine
said
the
lady
he
will
say
nothing
to
me
not
if
i
put
pug
in
a
surplice
and
make
him
lead
the
choir
at
this
speech
there
was
a
great
laugh
of
the
assembled
party
which
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
path
while
tatham
carriage
edged
away
and
the
others
made
efforts
to
get
forward
the
noise
of
their
talk
disturbed
the
curious
abstraction
in
which
elinor
had
been
going
through
the
morning
hours
mariamne
jarring
voice
seemed
louder
than
the
bells
was
this
the
first
voice
sent
out
to
greet
her
by
the
new
life
which
was
about
to
begin
she
glanced
at
her
mother
and
then
at
old
uncle
tatham
who
sat
immovable
prevented
by
decorum
from
apostrophising
the
coachman
who
was
not
his
own
but
fuming
inwardly
at
the
interruption
dennistoun
did
not
move
at
all
but
her
daughter
knew
very
well
what
was
meant
by
that
look
straight
before
her
in
which
her
mother
seemed
to
ignore
all
obstacles
in
the
way
i
got
here
very
well
lady
mariamne
went
on
we
started
in
the
middle
of
the
night
of
course
before
the
lamps
were
out
was
it
good
of
algy
to
get
himself
out
of
bed
at
such
an
unearthly
hour
but
he
snapped
at
puggy
as
we
came
down
which
was
a
sign
he
felt
it
why
are
you
with
the
poor
victim
at
the
altar
you
boys
phil
will
be
in
blue
funk
said
harry
go
in
and
stand
by
your
man
dick
the
jew
has
enough
with
two
fellows
to
see
her
into
her
place
the
bride
carriage
by
this
time
pushed
forward
making
lady
mariamne
start
in
confusion
oh
look
here
they
have
splashed
my
pretty
toilette
and
upset
my
nerves
she
cried
springing
back
into
her
supporter
arms
that
gentleman
regarded
the
stain
of
the
damp
gravel
on
the
lady
skirt
through
his
with
deep
but
helpless
anxiety
it
a
pity
for
the
pretty
frock
he
said
with
much
seriousness
and
the
group
gathered
round
and
gazed
in
dismay
as
if
they
expected
it
to
disappear
of
itself
until
hudson
bustled
up
it
will
rub
off
it
will
not
make
any
mark
if
one
of
you
gentlemen
will
lend
me
a
handkerchief
she
said
and
algy
and
harry
and
dick
bolsover
not
to
speak
of
lady
mariamne
herself
watched
with
great
gravity
while
the
gravel
was
swept
off
i
make
no
doubt
said
the
rector
wife
that
i
have
the
pleasure
of
speaking
to
lady
mariamne
and
i
do
doubt
that
black
is
the
fashion
and
your
dress
is
beautiful
but
if
you
would
just
throw
on
a
white
shawl
for
the
sake
of
the
wedding
it
so
unlucky
to
come
in
black
a
white
shawl
said
lady
mariamne
in
dismay
the
jew
in
a
white
shawl
echoed
the
others
with
a
burst
of
laughter
which
rang
into
the
church
itself
and
made
phil
before
the
altar
alone
and
very
anxious
ask
himself
what
was
up
it
china
crape
i
assure
you
and
very
nice
hudson
said
lady
mariamne
gave
the
good
samaritan
a
stony
stare
and
took
algy
arm
and
sailed
into
the
church
before
the
rector
wife
without
a
word
said
while
all
the
women
from
the
village
looked
at
each
other
and
said
well
i
never
under
their
breath
let
me
give
you
my
arm
hudson
said
harry
compton
and
please
pardon
me
that
i
did
not
introduce
my
sister
to
you
she
is
dreadfully
shy
do
you
know
and
never
does
speak
to
anyone
when
she
has
not
been
introduced
my
observation
was
a
very
simple
one
said
hudson
very
angry
yet
pleased
to
lean
upon
an
honourable
arm
my
dear
lady
cried
the
harry
the
jew
never
wore
a
shawl
in
her
life
and
all
this
time
the
organ
had
been
pealing
the
white
vision
passing
up
the
aisle
the
simple
villagers
chanting
forth
their
song
about
the
breath
that
breathed
eden
alas
eden
had
not
much
to
do
with
it
except
perhaps
in
the
trembling
heart
of
the
white
maiden
roused
out
of
her
virginal
dream
by
the
jarring
voices
of
the
new
life
the
laughter
outside
was
a
dreadful
offence
to
all
the
people
great
and
small
who
had
collected
to
see
elinor
married
what
could
you
expect
it
that
woman
whom
they
call
the
jew
whispered
lady
huntingtower
to
her
next
neighbour
she
should
be
put
into
the
stocks
said
sir
john
scarcely
under
his
breath
which
to
be
sure
was
also
an
interruption
to
the
decorum
of
the
place
and
then
there
ensued
a
pause
broken
by
the
voice
a
little
lugubrious
in
tone
of
the
rector
within
the
altar
rails
and
the
tremulous
answers
of
the
pair
outside
the
audience
held
its
breath
to
hear
elinor
make
her
responses
and
faltered
off
into
suppressed
weeping
as
the
low
tones
ceased
sir
john
huntingtower
who
was
very
tall
and
big
and
stood
out
like
a
pillar
among
the
ladies
round
kept
nodding
his
head
all
the
time
she
spoke
nodding
as
you
might
do
in
forced
assent
to
any
dreadful
vow
poor
little
thing
poor
little
thing
he
was
saying
in
his
heart
his
face
was
more
like
the
face
of
a
man
at
a
funeral
than
a
man
at
a
wedding
blessed
are
the
dead
that
die
in
the
lord
he
might
have
been
nodding
assent
to
that
instead
of
to
elinor
vow
phil
compton
voice
to
tell
the
truth
was
even
more
tremulous
than
elinor
to
investigate
the
thoughts
of
a
bridegroom
would
be
too
much
curiosity
at
such
a
moment
but
i
think
if
the
secrets
of
the
hearts
could
be
revealed
phil
for
a
moment
was
sorry
for
poor
little
elinor
too
and
then
the
solemnity
was
all
over
in
a
moment
and
the
flutter
of
voices
and
congratulations
began
i
do
not
mean
to
follow
the
proceedings
through
all
the
routine
of
the
attempts
were
made
on
the
part
of
the
bridegroom
party
to
get
lady
mariamne
dismissed
by
the
next
train
an
endeavour
into
which
harry
compton
threw
himself
for
he
was
always
a
fellow
with
his
whole
soul
but
the
jew
declared
that
she
was
dying
of
hunger
and
whatever
sort
of
place
it
was
must
have
something
to
eat
a
remark
which
naturally
endeared
her
still
more
to
dennistoun
who
was
waiting
by
the
door
of
tatham
carriage
which
that
anxious
old
gentleman
had
managed
to
recover
control
of
till
her
ladyship
had
taken
her
place
her
ladyship
stared
with
undisguised
amazement
when
she
was
followed
into
the
carriage
by
the
bride
mother
and
when
the
neat
little
old
gentleman
took
his
seat
opposite
but
where
is
algy
i
want
algy
she
cried
in
dismay
absolutely
i
ca
go
without
algy
who
came
to
take
care
of
me
you
will
be
perfectly
safe
my
dear
lady
with
dennistoun
and
me
the
gentlemen
will
walk
said
tatham
waving
his
hand
to
the
coachman
and
thus
it
was
that
the
forlorn
lady
found
herself
without
her
cavalier
and
without
her
pug
absolutely
stranded
among
savages
notwithstanding
her
strong
protest
almost
carried
the
length
of
tears
she
was
thus
carried
off
in
a
state
of
consternation
to
the
cottage
over
the
rough
road
where
the
wheels
went
with
a
din
and
lurch
over
the
stones
and
dug
deep
into
the
sand
eliciting
a
succession
of
little
shrieks
from
her
oppressed
bosom
i
shall
be
shaken
all
to
bits
she
said
grasping
the
arm
of
the
old
gentleman
to
steady
herself
tatham
was
not
displeased
to
be
the
champion
of
a
lady
of
title
he
assured
her
in
dulcet
tones
that
his
springs
were
very
good
and
his
horses
very
sure
though
it
is
not
a
very
nice
road
oh
it
is
a
dreadful
road
said
lady
mariamne
but
in
due
time
they
did
arrive
at
the
cottage
where
her
ladyship
could
not
wait
for
the
gathering
of
the
company
but
demanded
at
once
something
to
eat
i
ca
really
go
another
moment
without
food
i
must
have
something
or
i
shall
die
phil
come
here
this
instant
and
get
me
something
they
have
brought
me
off
at
the
risk
of
my
life
and
nobody
to
attend
to
me
do
stand
spooning
there
cried
lady
mariamne
but
do
what
i
tell
you
do
you
think
i
should
ever
have
put
myself
into
this
position
but
for
you
you
would
never
have
been
asked
here
if
they
had
consulted
me
i
knew
what
a
nuisance
you
be
here
get
this
lady
something
to
eat
old
man
said
the
bridegroom
tapping
tatham
on
the
back
who
did
indeed
look
rather
like
a
waiter
from
that
point
of
view
i
shall
have
to
help
myself
said
the
lady
in
despair
and
she
sat
down
at
the
elaborate
table
in
the
bride
place
and
began
to
hack
at
the
chicken
the
gentlemen
coming
in
at
the
moment
roared
again
with
laughter
over
the
jew
impatience
but
it
was
not
regarded
with
the
same
admiration
by
the
rest
of
the
guests
these
little
incidents
perhaps
helped
to
wile
away
the
weary
hours
until
it
was
time
for
the
bridal
pair
to
depart
dennistoun
was
so
angry
that
it
kept
up
a
little
fire
so
to
speak
in
her
heart
when
the
light
of
her
house
was
extinguished
lady
mariamne
standing
in
the
porch
with
a
bag
full
of
rice
to
throw
kept
up
the
spirit
of
the
mistress
of
the
house
which
otherwise
might
perhaps
have
failed
her
altogether
at
that
inconceivable
moment
for
though
she
had
been
looking
forward
to
it
for
months
it
was
inconceivable
when
it
came
as
death
is
inconceivable
elinor
going
away
not
on
a
visit
or
to
be
back
in
a
week
or
a
month
or
a
year
going
away
for
ever
ending
as
might
be
said
when
she
put
her
foot
on
the
step
of
the
carriage
her
mother
stood
by
and
looked
on
with
that
cruel
conviction
that
overtakes
all
at
the
last
up
to
this
moment
had
it
not
seemed
as
if
the
course
of
affairs
was
unreal
as
if
something
must
happen
to
prevent
it
perhaps
the
world
will
end
as
the
lover
says
in
the
last
ride
but
now
here
was
the
end
nothing
had
happened
the
world
was
swinging
on
in
space
in
its
old
careless
way
and
elinor
was
going
going
away
for
ever
and
ever
oh
to
come
back
perhaps
there
was
nothing
against
that
but
never
the
same
elinor
the
mother
stood
looking
with
her
hand
over
her
eyes
to
shield
them
from
the
sun
those
eyes
were
quite
dry
and
she
stood
firm
and
upright
by
the
carriage
door
she
was
not
breaking
down
or
giving
way
as
everybody
feared
she
was
bearing
up
as
everybody
was
relieved
to
see
and
in
a
moment
it
was
all
over
and
there
was
nothing
before
her
eyes
no
carriage
no
elinor
she
was
so
dazed
that
she
stood
still
looking
with
that
strange
kind
of
smile
for
a
full
minute
after
there
was
nothing
to
smile
at
only
the
vacant
air
and
the
prospect
of
the
combe
coming
in
in
a
sickly
haze
which
existed
only
in
her
eyes
but
by
good
luck
there
was
lady
mariamne
behind
and
the
fire
of
indignation
giving
a
red
flicker
upon
the
desolate
hearth
i
caught
phil
on
the
nose
said
that
lady
in
great
triumph
spoilt
his
beauty
for
him
for
but
let
hope
she
wo
mind
she
thinks
him
beautiful
the
little
goose
oh
my
did
that
cruel
algy
pull
your
little
dear
tail
you
darling
come
to
oos
own
mammy
now
those
silly
wedding
people
are
away
your
little
dog
i
presume
is
of
a
very
rare
sort
said
tatham
to
be
civil
he
had
proposed
the
bride
and
bridegroom
health
in
a
most
appropriate
speech
and
he
felt
that
he
had
deserved
well
of
his
kind
which
made
him
more
amiable
even
than
usual
your
ladyship
little
dog
he
added
after
a
moment
as
she
did
not
take
any
notice
i
presume
is
of
a
rare
kind
lady
mariamne
gave
him
a
look
or
rather
a
stare
is
puggy
of
a
rare
sort
she
said
over
her
shoulder
to
one
of
the
attendant
tribe
do
be
such
a
duffer
jew
you
know
as
well
as
any
one
what
breed
he
of
harry
compton
said
oh
i
forgot
said
the
fine
lady
she
was
standing
full
in
front
of
the
entrance
keeping
dennistoun
in
the
full
sun
outside
i
hope
there
a
train
very
soon
she
said
did
you
look
algy
as
i
told
you
if
it
had
been
that
phil
would
have
killed
me
i
should
have
gone
now
it
would
have
been
such
fun
to
have
spied
upon
the
turtle
doves
the
men
thought
it
would
have
been
rare
fun
with
obedient
delight
but
that
phil
would
have
cut
up
rough
and
made
a
scene
at
this
lady
mariamne
held
up
her
finger
and
made
a
portentous
face
oh
you
naughty
naughty
boy
she
cried
telling
tales
out
of
school
perhaps
my
dear
lady
said
tatham
quietly
you
would
let
dennistoun
pass
oh
said
lady
mariamne
and
stared
at
him
again
for
half
a
minute
then
she
turned
and
stared
at
the
tall
lady
in
grey
satin
anybody
can
pass
she
said
i
not
so
very
big
that
is
quite
true
quite
true
there
is
plenty
of
room
said
the
little
gentleman
holding
out
his
hand
to
his
cousin
my
dear
john
said
dennistoun
i
am
sure
you
will
be
kind
enough
to
lend
your
carriage
again
to
lady
mariamne
who
is
in
a
hurry
to
get
away
there
is
another
train
which
stops
at
downforth
station
in
half
an
hour
and
there
will
just
be
time
to
get
there
if
you
will
order
it
at
once
i
told
your
man
to
be
in
readiness
and
it
would
be
a
thousand
pities
to
lose
this
train
for
there
is
not
another
for
an
hour
by
jove
jew
there
a
slap
in
the
face
for
you
said
in
an
audible
whisper
one
of
the
train
who
had
been
standing
in
front
of
all
the
friends
blocking
out
the
view
as
for
lady
mariamne
she
stared
more
straight
than
ever
into
dennistoun
eyes
but
for
the
moment
did
not
seem
to
find
anything
to
say
she
was
left
in
the
hall
with
her
band
while
the
mistress
of
the
house
went
into
the
followed
by
all
the
country
ladies
who
had
not
lost
a
word
and
who
were
already
whispering
to
each
other
over
that
terrible
betrayal
about
the
temper
of
phil
cut
up
rough
oh
poor
little
elinor
poor
little
elinor
the
ladies
said
to
each
other
under
their
breath
i
am
not
at
all
surprised
it
is
not
any
news
to
me
you
could
see
it
in
his
eyes
said
miss
mary
dale
and
then
they
all
were
silent
to
listen
to
the
renewed
laughter
that
came
bursting
from
the
hall
hudson
questioned
her
husband
afterwards
as
to
what
it
was
that
made
everybody
laugh
but
the
rector
had
not
much
to
say
i
really
could
not
tell
you
my
dear
he
said
i
do
remember
anything
that
was
said
but
it
seemed
funny
somehow
and
as
they
all
laughed
one
had
to
laugh
too
the
great
lady
came
in
however
dragged
by
her
brother
to
say
it
has
all
gone
off
very
well
i
am
sure
and
nell
looked
very
nice
and
did
you
great
credit
she
said
putting
out
her
hand
and
very
kind
of
you
to
take
so
much
trouble
to
get
us
off
by
the
first
train
oh
it
is
no
trouble
dennistoun
said
should
you
like
to
say
to
said
lady
mariamne
touching
the
little
black
nose
upon
her
arm
he
enjoyed
that
so
much
he
really
never
has
at
home
but
he
does
at
all
mind
if
you
would
like
to
give
him
a
little
kiss
just
here
lady
mariamne
said
dennistoun
with
one
of
the
curtseys
of
the
old
school
but
there
was
another
gust
of
laughter
as
lady
mariamne
was
placed
in
the
carriage
and
a
shrill
little
trumpet
gave
forth
the
satisfaction
of
the
departing
guest
at
having
got
a
rise
out
of
the
old
girl
the
gentlemen
heaped
themselves
into
carriage
and
swept
off
along
with
her
all
but
civil
harry
who
waited
to
make
their
apologies
and
to
put
up
along
with
his
own
dick
bolsover
things
and
thus
the
bridegroom
party
the
new
associates
of
elinor
the
great
family
into
which
the
honourable
phil
compton
had
been
so
lucky
as
to
marry
to
the
great
excitement
of
all
the
country
round
departed
and
was
seen
no
more
harry
who
was
civil
walked
home
with
the
hudsons
when
all
was
over
and
said
the
best
he
could
for
the
jew
and
her
friends
you
see
she
has
been
regularly
spoiled
and
then
when
a
girl
so
dreadful
shy
as
often
as
not
it
sounds
like
impudence
dear
me
i
should
never
have
thought
lady
mariamne
was
shy
the
gentle
rector
said
that
just
how
it
is
said
harry
he
went
over
again
in
the
darkening
to
take
his
leave
of
dennistoun
he
found
her
sitting
out
in
the
garden
before
the
open
door
looking
down
the
misty
walk
the
light
had
gone
out
of
the
skies
but
the
usual
cheerful
lights
had
not
yet
appeared
in
the
house
where
the
hum
of
a
great
occasion
still
reigned
the
tathams
were
at
the
rectory
and
dennistoun
was
alone
harry
compton
had
a
good
heart
and
though
he
could
not
conceive
the
possibility
of
a
woman
not
being
glad
to
have
married
her
daughter
the
loneliness
and
darkness
touched
him
a
little
in
contrast
with
the
gayety
of
the
previous
night
you
must
think
us
a
dreadful
noisy
lot
he
said
and
as
if
my
sister
had
no
sense
but
it
only
the
jew
way
she
made
like
that
and
at
bottom
she
not
at
all
a
bad
sort
are
you
going
away
was
all
the
answer
that
dennistoun
made
oh
yes
and
we
shall
be
a
good
riddance
said
harry
but
please
do
think
any
worse
of
us
than
you
can
help
phil
well
he
got
a
great
deal
of
good
in
him
he
has
indeed
and
she
bring
it
all
out
it
was
very
good
of
harry
compton
he
had
a
little
choking
in
his
throat
as
he
walked
back
blest
if
i
ever
thought
of
it
in
that
light
before
he
said
to
himself
but
i
doubt
if
what
he
said
however
well
meant
brought
much
comfort
to
dennistoun
heart
chapter
xvii
thus
elinor
dennistoun
disappeared
from
windyhill
and
was
no
more
seen
there
are
many
ways
in
which
a
marriage
is
almost
like
a
death
especially
when
the
marriage
is
that
of
an
only
child
the
young
go
away
the
old
remain
there
is
all
the
dreary
routine
of
the
solitary
life
unbrightened
by
that
companionship
which
is
all
the
world
to
the
one
who
is
left
behind
so
little
only
the
happy
going
away
into
brighter
scenes
of
one
whose
happiness
was
the
whole
thought
of
that
dreary
survivor
at
the
chimney
corner
and
yet
so
much
and
if
that
survivor
is
a
woman
she
has
to
smile
and
tell
her
neighbours
of
the
bride
happiness
and
how
great
the
comfort
to
herself
that
her
elinor
life
is
assured
and
her
own
ending
is
now
of
no
particular
importance
to
her
daughter
if
it
is
a
man
he
is
allowed
to
lament
which
is
a
curious
paradox
but
one
of
the
many
current
in
this
world
dennistoun
had
to
put
a
very
brave
face
upon
it
all
the
more
because
of
the
known
unsatisfactoriness
of
elinor
husband
and
she
had
to
go
on
with
her
life
and
sit
down
at
her
solitary
meals
and
invent
lonely
occupations
for
herself
and
read
and
read
till
her
brains
were
often
dazed
by
the
multiplicity
of
the
words
which
lost
their
meaning
as
she
turned
over
page
by
page
to
sit
alone
in
the
house
without
a
sound
audible
except
perhaps
the
movement
of
the
servants
going
or
down
to
minister
to
the
wants
about
which
she
felt
she
cared
nothing
whether
they
were
ministered
to
or
not
of
their
solitary
mistress
where
a
little
while
ago
there
used
to
be
the
rhythm
of
the
one
quick
step
the
sound
of
the
one
gay
voice
which
made
the
world
a
warm
inhabited
place
to
dennistoun
this
was
more
dismal
than
words
could
say
to
be
sure
there
were
some
extraordinary
and
delightful
differences
there
were
the
almost
daily
letters
which
afforded
the
lonely
mother
all
the
pleasure
that
life
could
give
and
there
was
always
the
prospect
or
at
least
possibility
and
hope
of
seeing
her
child
again
those
two
particulars
it
need
scarcely
be
said
make
a
difference
which
is
practically
infinite
but
yet
for
dennistoun
sitting
alone
all
the
day
and
night
walking
alone
reading
alone
with
little
to
do
that
was
of
the
slightest
consequence
not
even
the
reading
for
what
did
it
matter
to
her
dreary
lonely
consciousness
whether
she
kept
afloat
of
general
literature
or
improved
her
mind
or
not
this
separation
by
marriage
was
dreadfully
like
the
dreary
separation
by
death
and
in
one
respect
it
was
almost
worse
for
death
if
it
reaches
our
very
hearts
takes
away
at
least
the
gnawing
pangs
of
anxiety
he
or
she
who
is
gone
that
way
is
well
never
more
can
trouble
touch
them
their
feet
can
not
err
nor
their
hearts
ache
while
who
can
tell
what
troubles
and
miseries
may
be
befalling
out
there
in
the
unknown
the
child
who
has
embarked
upon
the
troubled
sea
of
mortal
life
and
it
may
be
imagined
with
what
anxious
eyes
those
letters
which
made
all
the
difference
were
read
how
the
gradually
changing
tone
in
them
was
noted
as
it
came
in
slowly
but
also
surely
sometimes
they
got
to
be
very
hurried
and
then
dennistoun
saw
as
in
a
glass
the
impatient
husband
waiting
wondering
what
she
could
constantly
find
to
say
to
her
mother
sometimes
they
were
long
and
detailed
and
that
meant
as
would
appear
perhaps
by
a
phrase
slurred
over
in
the
postscript
that
phil
had
gone
away
somewhere
there
was
never
a
complaint
in
them
never
a
word
that
could
be
twisted
into
a
complaint
but
the
anxious
mother
read
between
the
lines
innumerable
things
not
half
of
them
true
there
is
perhaps
never
a
half
true
of
what
anxiety
may
imagine
but
then
the
half
that
is
true
john
tatham
was
very
faithful
to
her
during
that
winter
as
soon
as
he
came
back
from
switzerland
at
the
end
of
the
long
vacation
he
went
down
to
see
her
feeling
the
difference
in
the
house
beyond
anything
he
had
imagined
feeling
as
if
he
were
stepping
into
some
darkened
outer
chamber
of
the
grave
but
with
a
cheerful
face
and
eager
but
confident
interest
in
the
news
from
elinor
of
course
she
is
enjoying
herself
immensely
he
said
and
dennistoun
was
able
to
reply
with
a
smile
that
was
a
little
wistful
that
yes
elinor
was
enjoying
herself
immensely
she
seems
very
happy
and
everything
is
new
to
her
and
bright
she
said
they
were
both
very
glad
that
elinor
was
happy
and
they
were
very
cheerful
themselves
dennistoun
truly
cheered
by
his
visit
and
by
the
necessity
for
looking
after
everything
that
john
might
be
comfortable
and
the
pleasure
of
seeing
his
face
opposite
to
her
at
table
you
ca
think
what
it
is
to
see
you
there
sitting
down
to
dinner
is
the
most
horrible
farce
when
one
is
alone
poor
aunt
john
tatham
said
and
nobody
would
believe
how
many
saturdays
and
sundays
he
gave
up
to
her
during
the
long
winter
somehow
he
himself
did
not
care
to
go
anywhere
else
in
elinor
time
he
had
gone
about
freely
enough
liking
a
little
variety
in
his
saturday
to
mondays
though
always
happiest
when
he
went
to
windyhill
but
now
somehow
the
other
houses
seemed
to
pall
upon
him
he
liked
best
to
go
down
to
that
melancholy
house
which
his
presence
made
more
or
less
bright
where
there
was
an
endless
talk
of
elinor
where
she
was
what
she
was
doing
and
what
was
to
be
her
next
move
and
at
last
when
she
was
coming
to
town
dennistoun
did
not
say
as
she
did
at
first
when
she
is
coming
home
that
possibility
seemed
to
slip
away
somehow
and
no
one
suggested
it
when
she
was
coming
to
town
that
was
what
they
said
between
themselves
she
had
spent
the
spring
on
the
riviera
a
great
part
of
it
at
monte
carlo
and
her
letters
were
full
of
the
beauty
of
the
place
but
she
said
less
and
less
about
people
and
more
and
more
about
the
sea
and
the
mountains
and
the
glorious
road
which
gave
at
every
turn
a
new
and
beautiful
vision
of
the
hills
and
the
sea
it
was
a
little
like
a
they
sometimes
felt
but
neither
said
it
but
at
last
it
became
certain
that
in
the
month
of
may
she
was
coming
to
town
more
than
that
oh
more
than
that
one
evening
in
may
when
it
was
fine
but
a
little
chilly
when
dennistoun
was
walking
wistfully
in
her
garden
looking
at
the
moon
shining
in
the
west
and
wondering
if
her
child
had
arrived
in
england
and
whether
she
was
coming
to
a
house
of
her
own
or
a
lodging
or
to
be
a
visitor
in
some
one
else
house
details
which
elinor
had
not
given
her
ear
was
suddenly
caught
by
the
distant
rumbling
of
wheels
heavy
wheels
the
fly
from
the
station
certainly
dennistoun
had
no
expectation
of
what
it
could
be
no
sort
of
hope
and
yet
a
woman
has
always
a
sort
of
hope
when
her
child
lives
and
everything
is
possible
the
fly
seemed
to
stop
not
coming
up
the
little
cottage
drive
but
by
and
by
when
she
had
almost
given
up
hoping
there
came
a
rush
of
flying
feet
and
a
cry
of
joy
and
elinor
was
in
her
mother
arms
elinor
yes
it
was
herself
no
vision
no
shadow
such
as
had
many
a
time
come
into
dennistoun
dreams
but
herself
in
flesh
and
blood
the
dear
familiar
figure
the
face
which
between
the
twilight
and
those
ridiculous
tears
which
come
when
one
is
too
happy
could
scarcely
be
seen
at
all
elinor
elinor
it
is
you
my
darling
yes
mother
it
is
me
really
me
i
could
not
write
because
i
did
not
know
till
the
last
minute
whether
i
could
get
away
it
may
be
imagined
what
a
coming
home
that
was
dennistoun
when
she
saw
her
daughter
even
by
the
light
of
the
lamp
was
greatly
comforted
elinor
was
looking
well
she
was
changed
in
that
indescribable
way
in
which
marriage
changes
though
not
always
the
happiest
woman
and
her
appearance
was
changed
she
was
no
longer
the
country
young
lady
very
well
dressed
and
looking
as
well
as
any
one
could
in
her
carefully
made
clothes
she
was
now
a
fashionable
young
woman
about
whose
dresses
there
was
no
question
who
wore
everything
as
those
do
who
are
at
the
no
matter
what
it
was
she
wore
dennistoun
eyes
caught
this
difference
at
once
which
is
also
indescribable
to
the
uninitiated
and
a
sensation
of
pride
came
into
her
mind
elinor
was
improved
too
in
so
many
ways
her
mother
had
never
thought
of
calling
her
anything
more
even
in
her
inmost
thoughts
than
very
pretty
very
sweet
but
it
seemed
to
dennistoun
now
as
if
people
might
use
a
stronger
word
and
call
elinor
beautiful
her
face
had
gained
a
great
deal
of
expression
though
it
was
always
an
expressive
face
her
eyes
looked
deeper
her
manner
had
a
wonderful
youthful
dignity
altogether
it
was
another
elinor
yet
god
be
praised
the
same
it
was
but
for
one
night
but
that
was
a
great
deal
a
night
subtracted
from
the
blank
a
night
that
seemed
to
come
out
of
the
old
times
those
old
times
that
had
not
been
known
to
be
so
very
happy
till
they
were
over
and
gone
elinor
had
naturally
a
great
deal
to
tell
her
mother
but
in
the
glory
of
seeing
her
of
hearing
her
voice
of
knowing
that
it
was
actually
she
who
was
speaking
dennistoun
did
not
observe
what
she
remembered
afterwards
that
again
it
was
much
more
of
places
than
of
people
that
elinor
talked
and
that
though
she
named
phil
when
there
was
any
occasion
for
doing
so
she
did
not
babble
about
him
as
brides
do
as
if
he
were
altogether
the
sun
and
everything
revolved
round
him
it
is
not
a
good
sign
perhaps
when
the
husband
comes
down
to
his
proper
place
as
the
representative
of
the
other
half
of
the
world
too
soon
elinor
looked
round
upon
her
old
home
with
a
mingled
smile
and
sigh
undoubtedly
it
had
grown
smaller
perhaps
even
shabbier
since
she
went
away
but
she
did
not
say
so
to
her
mother
she
cried
out
how
pretty
it
was
how
delightful
to
come
back
to
it
and
that
was
true
too
how
often
it
happens
in
this
life
that
there
are
two
things
quite
opposed
to
each
other
and
yet
both
of
them
true
john
will
be
delighted
to
hear
that
you
have
come
elinor
her
mother
said
john
dear
old
john
i
hope
he
is
well
and
happy
and
all
that
and
he
comes
often
to
see
you
mother
how
sweet
of
him
you
must
give
him
ever
so
much
love
from
his
poor
nelly
i
always
keep
that
name
sacred
to
him
but
why
should
i
give
him
messages
as
if
you
were
not
sure
to
meet
of
course
you
will
meet
often
do
you
think
so
said
elinor
she
opened
her
eyes
a
little
in
surprise
and
then
shook
her
head
i
am
afraid
not
mamma
we
are
in
two
different
worlds
i
assure
you
said
dennistoun
john
is
a
very
rising
man
he
is
invited
everywhere
that
i
do
doubt
at
all
and
why
then
should
you
meet
i
do
know
i
do
fancy
we
shall
go
to
the
same
places
john
has
a
profession
he
has
something
to
do
now
you
know
we
have
nothing
to
do
she
laughed
and
laid
a
little
emphasis
on
the
by
way
of
taking
off
the
weight
of
the
words
i
always
thought
it
was
a
great
pity
elinor
it
may
be
a
pity
or
not
said
elinor
but
it
is
and
it
can
not
be
helped
we
have
got
to
make
up
our
minds
to
it
i
would
rather
phil
did
nothing
than
mixed
himself
up
with
companies
thank
heaven
at
present
he
is
free
of
anything
of
that
kind
i
hope
he
is
free
of
that
one
at
least
that
he
was
going
to
invest
all
your
money
in
elinor
i
hope
you
found
another
investment
that
was
quite
steady
and
safe
oh
i
suppose
so
said
elinor
with
some
of
her
old
petulance
let
us
spoil
the
little
time
i
have
by
talking
about
money
mamma
and
then
it
was
that
dennistoun
noticed
that
what
elinor
did
talk
of
hurrying
away
from
this
subject
were
things
of
not
the
least
importance
the
olive
woods
on
the
riviera
the
wealth
of
flowers
the
strange
little
old
towns
upon
the
hills
surely
even
the
money
which
was
her
own
and
for
her
comfort
would
be
a
more
interesting
subject
to
discuss
perhaps
elinor
herself
perceived
this
for
she
began
immediately
to
ask
questions
about
the
hudsons
and
hills
and
all
the
people
of
the
parish
with
much
eagerness
of
questioning
but
a
flagging
interest
in
the
replies
as
her
mother
soon
saw
and
mary
dale
is
she
still
there
she
asked
dennistoun
entered
into
a
little
history
of
how
mary
dale
had
gone
away
to
nurse
a
distant
cousin
who
had
been
ill
and
finally
had
died
and
left
a
very
comfortable
little
fortune
to
her
kind
attendant
elinor
listened
with
little
nods
and
appropriate
exclamations
but
before
the
evening
was
out
asked
again
and
mary
dale
then
hastily
corrected
herself
with
an
oh
i
remember
you
told
me
but
it
was
perhaps
safer
not
to
question
her
how
much
she
remembered
of
what
she
had
been
told
thus
there
were
notes
of
disquiet
in
even
that
delightful
evening
such
a
contrast
as
it
was
to
all
the
evenings
since
she
had
left
home
even
when
john
came
what
a
poor
substitute
for
elinor
the
ingratitude
of
those
whose
heart
is
set
on
one
object
made
dennistoun
thus
make
light
of
what
had
been
her
great
consolation
he
was
very
kind
very
good
and
oh
how
glad
she
had
been
to
see
him
through
that
heavy
winter
but
he
was
not
elinor
it
was
enough
for
elinor
to
step
across
her
mother
threshold
to
make
dennistoun
feel
that
there
was
no
substitute
for
her
none
and
that
john
was
of
no
more
consequence
than
the
rector
or
any
habitual
caller
but
at
the
same
time
in
all
the
melody
of
the
in
the
sweetness
of
elinor
voice
and
look
and
kiss
in
the
perfection
of
seeing
her
there
again
in
her
own
place
and
listening
to
her
dear
step
running
up
and
down
the
no
longer
silent
house
there
were
notes
of
disquiet
which
could
not
be
mistaken
she
was
not
unhappy
the
mother
thought
her
eyes
could
not
be
so
bright
nor
her
colour
so
fair
unless
she
was
happy
trouble
does
not
embellish
and
elinor
was
embellished
but
yet
there
were
notes
of
disquiet
in
the
air
next
day
dennistoun
drove
her
child
to
the
railway
in
order
not
to
lose
a
moment
of
so
short
a
visit
and
naturally
though
she
had
received
that
unexpected
visit
with
rapture
feeling
that
a
whole
night
of
elinor
was
worth
a
month
a
year
of
anybody
else
yet
now
that
elinor
was
going
she
found
it
very
short
you
come
again
soon
my
darling
she
said
as
she
stood
at
the
window
of
the
carriage
ready
to
say
whenever
i
can
mother
dear
of
that
you
may
be
sure
whenever
i
can
get
away
i
do
wish
to
draw
you
from
your
husband
do
get
away
come
with
philip
from
saturday
to
monday
give
him
my
love
and
tell
him
so
he
shall
not
be
bored
but
sunday
is
a
day
without
engagements
oh
not
now
mamma
there
are
just
as
many
things
to
do
on
sundays
as
on
any
other
day
there
were
a
great
many
words
on
dennistoun
lips
but
she
did
not
say
them
all
she
did
say
was
well
then
elinor
when
you
can
get
away
oh
you
need
not
doubt
me
mamma
and
the
train
which
sometimes
lingers
so
long
which
some
people
that
very
day
were
swearing
at
as
so
slow
like
all
country
trains
they
said
that
inevitable
heartless
thing
got
into
motion
and
dennistoun
watched
it
till
it
disappeared
and
what
was
that
that
came
over
elinor
face
as
she
sank
back
into
the
corner
of
her
carriage
not
knowing
her
mother
anxious
look
followed
her
still
what
was
it
oh
dreadful
dreadful
life
oh
fruitless
love
and
longing
was
it
relief
the
mother
tried
to
get
that
look
out
of
her
mind
as
she
drove
silently
and
slowly
home
creeping
up
hill
after
hill
there
was
no
need
to
hurry
all
that
she
was
going
to
was
an
empty
and
silent
house
where
nobody
awaited
her
what
was
that
look
on
elinor
face
relief
to
have
it
over
to
get
away
again
away
from
her
old
home
and
her
fond
mother
away
to
her
new
life
dennistoun
was
not
a
jealous
mother
nor
unreasonable
she
said
to
herself
well
it
was
no
doubt
a
trial
to
the
child
to
come
back
to
come
alone
all
the
time
perhaps
she
was
afraid
of
being
too
closely
questioned
of
having
to
confess
that
did
not
want
to
come
perhaps
grudged
her
coming
she
might
be
afraid
that
her
mother
would
divine
something
some
hidden
opposition
some
dislike
perhaps
on
his
part
poor
elinor
and
when
everything
had
passed
over
so
well
when
it
was
ended
and
nothing
had
been
between
them
but
love
and
mutual
understanding
what
wonder
if
there
came
over
her
dear
face
a
look
of
relief
this
was
how
this
good
woman
who
had
seen
a
great
many
things
in
her
passage
through
life
explained
her
child
look
and
though
she
was
sad
was
not
angry
as
many
less
tolerant
and
less
might
have
been
in
her
place
john
that
good
john
to
whom
she
had
been
so
ungrateful
came
down
next
saturday
and
to
him
she
confided
her
great
news
but
not
all
of
it
she
came
down
alone
he
said
well
said
dennistoun
bravely
she
knew
very
well
it
was
her
i
wanted
to
see
and
not
philip
they
say
a
great
deal
about
but
why
should
we
in
our
turn
have
our
fling
at
john
it
was
not
him
i
wanted
to
see
it
was
my
own
child
and
elinor
understood
that
and
ran
off
by
herself
bless
her
for
the
thought
i
understand
that
said
john
he
had
given
the
mother
more
than
one
look
as
she
spoke
and
divined
her
better
than
she
supposed
oh
yes
i
can
understand
that
the
thing
i
do
understand
is
why
he
let
her
why
he
was
too
proud
to
bring
her
back
to
you
that
you
might
see
she
had
taken
no
harm
if
it
had
been
i
ah
but
it
was
not
you
said
dennistoun
you
forget
that
it
never
could
have
been
you
he
looked
quickly
at
her
again
and
it
was
on
his
lips
to
ask
why
could
it
never
have
been
i
but
he
did
not
for
he
knew
that
if
it
had
ever
been
him
it
could
not
have
been
for
years
he
was
too
prudent
and
elinor
even
if
she
had
escaped
phil
compton
would
have
met
some
one
else
he
had
no
right
to
say
or
even
think
what
in
the
circumstances
he
would
have
done
he
did
not
make
any
answer
but
she
understood
him
as
he
understood
her
and
later
in
the
evening
she
asked
his
advice
as
to
what
she
should
do
i
am
not
fond
of
asking
advice
she
said
and
i
do
think
there
is
another
in
the
world
i
would
ask
it
from
but
you
what
should
i
do
it
would
cost
me
nothing
to
run
up
to
town
for
a
part
of
the
season
at
least
i
might
get
a
little
house
and
be
near
her
where
she
could
come
to
me
when
she
pleased
should
i
do
it
or
would
it
be
wise
not
to
do
it
i
do
want
to
spy
upon
her
or
to
force
her
to
tell
me
more
than
she
wishes
john
my
dear
i
will
tell
you
what
i
would
tell
no
one
else
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
dear
face
when
the
train
was
just
going
out
of
sight
and
she
was
sinking
back
in
her
corner
with
a
look
of
relief
of
relief
he
cried
john
do
form
any
false
impression
it
was
no
want
of
love
but
i
think
she
was
thankful
to
have
seen
me
and
to
have
satisfied
me
and
that
i
had
asked
no
questions
that
she
could
not
answer
in
a
way
john
clenched
his
fist
but
he
dared
not
make
any
gesture
of
disgust
or
suggest
again
if
it
had
been
i
well
now
she
said
remember
i
am
not
angry
fancy
being
angry
with
elinor
and
all
i
mean
is
for
her
benefit
should
i
go
it
might
be
a
relief
to
her
to
run
into
me
whenever
she
pleased
or
should
i
not
go
lest
she
might
think
i
was
bent
on
finding
out
more
than
she
chose
to
tell
would
it
be
right
that
you
should
find
out
that
is
just
the
point
upon
which
i
am
doubtful
she
is
not
unhappy
for
she
is
she
is
prettier
than
ever
she
was
john
a
girl
does
not
get
like
that
her
eyes
brighter
her
colour
clearer
looking
well
beautiful
cried
the
mother
her
eyes
filling
with
bright
tears
if
she
is
unhappy
but
there
may
be
things
that
are
not
quite
smooth
that
she
might
think
it
would
make
me
unhappy
to
know
yet
that
if
let
alone
might
come
all
right
tell
me
john
what
should
i
do
and
they
sat
debating
thus
till
far
on
in
the
night
chapter
xviii
dennistoun
did
not
go
up
to
town
there
are
some
women
who
would
have
done
so
seeing
the
other
side
of
the
subject
at
all
hazards
and
perhaps
they
would
have
been
right
who
can
tell
she
did
not
denying
herself
keeping
herself
by
main
force
in
her
solitude
not
to
interfere
with
the
life
of
her
child
which
was
drawn
on
lines
so
different
from
any
of
hers
and
perhaps
she
was
wrong
who
knows
except
by
the
event
which
is
the
best
or
the
worst
way
in
any
of
our
human
movements
which
are
so
and
twice
during
the
season
elinor
found
means
to
come
to
the
cottage
for
a
night
as
she
had
done
at
first
these
were
occasions
of
great
happiness
it
need
not
be
said
but
of
many
thoughts
and
wonderings
too
she
had
always
an
excuse
for
phil
he
had
meant
until
the
last
moment
to
come
with
her
some
one
had
turned
up
quite
unexpectedly
who
had
prevented
him
it
was
a
fatality
especially
when
she
came
down
in
july
did
she
insist
upon
this
he
had
been
invited
quite
suddenly
to
a
political
dinner
to
meet
one
of
the
ministers
from
whom
he
had
hopes
of
an
appointment
for
we
find
that
we
ca
go
on
enjoying
ourselves
for
ever
she
said
gayly
and
phil
has
made
up
his
mind
he
must
get
something
to
do
it
is
always
the
best
way
said
dennistoun
i
am
not
so
very
sure
mamma
when
you
have
never
been
used
to
it
of
course
some
people
would
be
wretched
without
work
fancy
john
with
nothing
to
do
how
he
would
torment
his
wife
if
he
had
one
but
phil
never
does
that
he
is
very
easy
to
live
with
he
is
always
after
something
and
leaves
me
as
free
as
if
he
had
a
day
work
in
an
office
this
slipped
out
with
a
smile
but
evidently
after
it
was
said
elinor
regretted
she
had
said
it
and
thought
that
more
might
be
drawn
from
the
admission
than
she
intended
she
added
quietly
of
course
a
settled
occupation
would
interfere
with
many
things
we
could
not
go
out
together
continually
as
we
do
now
was
there
any
way
of
reconciling
these
two
statements
dennistoun
tried
and
tried
in
vain
to
make
them
fit
into
each
other
and
yet
no
doubt
there
was
some
way
and
perhaps
another
season
mother
if
phil
was
in
a
public
office
it
seems
so
strange
to
think
of
phil
having
an
office
you
might
come
up
do
you
think
to
town
for
a
time
would
it
be
a
dreadful
bore
to
you
to
leave
the
country
just
when
it
is
at
its
best
i
afraid
it
would
be
a
dreadful
bore
but
we
could
run
about
together
in
the
mornings
when
he
was
busy
and
go
to
see
the
pictures
and
things
how
pleasant
it
would
be
it
would
be
delightful
for
me
elinor
i
should
mind
giving
up
the
country
if
it
would
interfere
with
your
engagements
my
dear
oh
my
engagements
much
i
should
care
for
them
if
phil
was
occupied
i
like
of
course
to
be
with
him
of
course
said
dennistoun
and
it
is
good
for
him
too
i
think
this
was
another
of
the
little
admissions
that
elinor
regretted
the
moment
they
were
made
i
mean
a
pity
is
it
when
a
man
likes
to
have
his
wife
with
him
that
she
should
always
be
there
ready
to
go
a
great
pity
said
dennistoun
and
then
she
changed
the
subject
i
thought
it
required
all
sorts
of
examinations
and
things
for
a
man
to
get
into
a
public
office
now
so
it
does
for
the
ordinary
grades
which
would
be
far
far
too
much
routine
for
phil
but
they
say
a
minister
always
has
things
in
his
power
there
are
still
posts
sinecures
elinor
i
did
not
mean
exactly
sinecures
she
said
with
an
embarrassed
laugh
though
i
think
those
must
have
been
fine
things
but
posts
where
it
is
not
merely
routine
where
a
man
may
have
a
chance
of
acting
for
himself
and
distinguishing
himself
perhaps
and
to
be
in
the
service
of
the
country
is
always
better
safer
than
that
dreadful
city
do
you
think
so
i
have
never
thought
the
city
dreadful
elinor
i
have
had
many
friends
connected
with
the
city
ah
but
not
in
those
horrid
companies
mamma
do
you
know
that
company
which
we
just
escaped
which
phil
saved
my
money
out
of
when
it
was
all
but
invested
i
believe
that
has
ruined
people
right
and
left
he
got
out
of
it
fortunately
just
before
the
smash
that
is
of
course
he
never
had
very
much
to
do
with
it
he
was
only
on
the
board
and
where
is
your
money
now
oh
i
can
answer
that
question
this
time
said
elinor
gayly
he
had
just
time
to
get
it
into
another
company
which
pays
beautifully
the
jew
is
in
it
too
and
the
whole
lot
of
them
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
mamma
i
tried
hard
to
call
her
by
her
proper
name
but
when
one
never
hears
any
other
one
ca
help
getting
into
it
i
hope
said
dennistoun
that
philip
was
not
much
mixed
up
with
this
company
if
other
people
have
been
ruined
and
he
has
escaped
how
could
that
be
said
elinor
with
a
sort
of
tremulous
dignity
you
do
suppose
for
a
moment
that
he
but
of
course
you
do
she
added
with
a
heightened
colour
and
a
momentary
cloud
over
her
eyes
of
course
you
do
there
was
a
dreadful
manager
who
destroyed
the
books
and
then
fled
so
that
there
never
could
be
a
right
winding
up
of
the
affairs
i
hope
philip
will
take
great
care
never
to
have
to
do
with
anything
of
the
kind
again
oh
no
he
has
promised
me
he
will
not
i
will
not
have
it
he
has
a
kind
of
ornamental
directorship
on
this
new
company
just
for
the
sake
of
his
name
but
he
has
promised
me
he
will
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
it
for
my
peace
of
mind
i
wonder
that
they
should
care
in
the
city
for
so
small
a
matter
as
a
peer
younger
son
oh
do
you
think
it
a
small
matter
mamma
i
do
mean
that
i
care
but
people
give
a
good
deal
of
weight
to
it
you
know
i
meant
only
in
the
city
elinor
oh
elinor
said
she
was
half
offended
with
her
mother
indifference
she
had
found
that
to
be
the
hon
compton
was
something
or
so
at
least
she
supposed
and
she
began
timidly
to
give
her
mother
a
list
of
her
engagements
which
were
indeed
many
in
number
and
there
were
some
dazzling
names
among
a
great
many
with
which
dennistoun
was
unacquainted
but
how
could
she
know
who
were
the
fashionable
people
nowadays
a
woman
living
so
completely
out
of
the
world
john
tatham
for
his
part
went
through
his
engagements
that
year
with
a
constant
expectation
of
seeing
elinor
which
preoccupied
him
more
than
a
rising
young
barrister
going
everywhere
ought
to
have
been
preoccupied
he
thought
he
went
everywhere
and
so
did
his
family
at
home
especially
his
sister
mary
tatham
who
was
his
father
nurse
and
attendant
and
never
had
any
chance
of
sharing
these
delights
she
made
all
the
more
as
was
natural
of
john
privileges
and
social
success
from
the
fact
of
her
own
seclusion
and
was
in
the
habit
of
saying
that
she
believed
there
was
scarcely
a
party
in
london
to
which
john
was
not
invited
three
or
four
in
a
night
but
it
would
seem
with
all
this
that
there
were
many
parties
to
which
he
was
not
invited
for
the
phil
comptons
how
strange
and
on
the
whole
disgusting
to
think
that
this
now
meant
elinor
also
went
everywhere
and
yet
they
very
seldom
met
it
was
true
that
john
could
not
expect
to
meet
them
at
dinner
at
a
judge
or
in
the
legal
society
in
high
places
which
was
his
especial
sphere
and
nothing
could
be
more
foolish
than
the
tremor
of
expectation
with
which
this
very
man
would
set
out
to
every
house
in
which
the
fashionable
world
met
with
the
professional
always
thinking
that
perhaps
but
it
was
rarely
very
rarely
that
this
perhaps
came
to
pass
when
it
did
it
was
amid
the
crowd
of
some
prodigious
reception
to
which
people
looked
in
for
half
an
hour
and
where
on
one
occasion
he
found
elinor
alone
with
that
curious
dignity
about
her
a
little
tragical
which
comes
of
neglect
he
agreed
with
her
mother
that
he
had
never
imagined
youthful
prettiness
could
have
come
to
anything
so
near
beauty
there
was
a
strained
wide
open
look
in
her
eyes
which
was
half
done
by
looking
out
for
some
one
and
half
by
defying
any
one
to
think
that
she
felt
herself
alone
or
was
pursuing
that
search
with
any
anxiety
she
stood
exceedingly
erect
silent
observing
everything
yet
endeavouring
to
appear
as
if
she
did
not
observe
altogether
a
singular
and
very
striking
figure
among
the
fashionable
crowd
in
which
it
seemed
everybody
was
chattering
smiling
gay
or
making
believe
to
be
gay
except
herself
when
she
saw
john
a
sudden
gleam
of
pleasure
followed
by
a
cloud
of
embarrassment
came
over
her
face
but
poor
elinor
could
not
help
being
glad
to
see
some
one
she
knew
some
one
who
more
or
less
belonged
to
her
although
it
appeared
she
had
the
best
of
reasons
for
being
alone
i
was
to
meet
phil
here
she
said
but
somehow
i
must
have
missed
him
let
us
walk
about
a
little
and
we
be
sure
to
find
him
said
john
she
was
so
glad
to
take
his
arm
almost
to
cling
to
him
to
find
herself
with
a
friend
i
do
know
many
people
here
she
confided
to
john
leaning
on
his
arm
with
the
familiar
sisterly
dependence
of
old
and
i
am
so
stupid
about
coming
out
by
myself
it
is
because
i
have
never
been
used
to
it
there
has
always
been
mamma
and
then
phil
but
i
suppose
he
has
been
detained
somewhere
i
think
i
never
felt
so
lost
before
among
all
these
strange
people
he
knows
everybody
of
course
but
you
have
a
lot
of
friends
elinor
oh
yes
she
said
brightly
enough
in
our
own
set
but
this
is
what
phil
calls
more
serious
than
our
set
i
should
not
wonder
in
the
least
if
he
had
shirked
it
at
the
last
knowing
i
would
be
sure
to
come
that
is
just
the
reason
why
i
should
have
thought
he
would
not
shirk
it
said
john
ah
that
because
you
not
married
said
elinor
but
with
a
laugh
in
which
there
was
no
bitterness
do
you
know
one
good
of
a
wife
is
to
do
the
man
social
duties
for
him
to
appear
at
the
dull
places
and
save
his
credit
oh
i
do
object
at
all
it
is
quite
a
legitimate
division
of
labour
i
shall
get
into
it
in
time
but
i
am
so
stupid
about
coming
into
a
room
alone
and
instead
of
looking
about
to
see
what
people
i
really
do
know
i
just
stiffen
into
a
sort
of
shell
i
should
never
have
known
you
if
you
had
not
come
up
to
me
john
you
see
i
was
looking
out
for
you
and
you
were
not
looking
out
for
me
that
makes
all
the
difference
you
were
looking
out
for
us
ever
since
the
season
began
i
have
been
looking
out
for
you
everywhere
said
john
with
a
rather
fierce
emphasis
on
the
pronoun
which
however
as
everybody
knows
is
plural
and
means
two
as
much
as
one
though
it
was
the
reverse
of
this
that
john
tatham
meant
to
show
ah
said
elinor
but
then
i
am
afraid
our
set
is
different
john
there
will
always
be
some
places
like
this
for
instance
where
i
hope
we
shall
meet
but
our
set
perhaps
is
a
little
frivolous
and
your
set
a
little
serious
do
you
see
you
are
professional
and
political
and
all
that
and
phil
is
well
i
do
know
exactly
what
phil
is
more
fashionable
and
frivolous
as
i
said
a
always
in
motion
set
most
people
said
john
go
more
or
less
to
races
and
balls
more
or
less
that
makes
the
whole
difference
we
go
to
them
all
now
you
see
the
distinction
john
you
go
to
ascot
perhaps
on
the
cup
day
we
go
all
the
days
and
all
the
other
days
at
the
other
places
how
knowing
you
have
become
have
i
she
said
with
a
smile
that
was
half
a
sigh
but
i
should
have
thought
that
would
have
suited
you
elinor
oh
yes
it
does
she
said
and
then
she
eyed
him
with
something
of
the
defiance
that
had
been
in
her
look
when
she
was
standing
alone
she
did
not
avoid
his
look
as
a
less
brave
woman
might
have
done
i
like
the
fun
of
it
she
said
and
then
there
was
a
pause
for
he
did
not
know
what
to
reply
we
have
been
through
all
the
rooms
she
said
at
last
and
we
have
not
seen
a
ghost
of
phil
he
can
not
be
coming
now
what
is
it
oh
just
the
time
he
will
be
due
at
i
sure
he
ca
come
now
do
you
think
you
could
get
my
carriage
for
me
it
only
a
brougham
that
we
hire
she
said
with
a
smile
but
the
man
is
such
a
nice
kind
man
if
he
had
been
an
old
family
coachman
he
could
take
more
care
of
me
that
looks
as
if
he
had
to
take
care
of
you
often
elinor
well
she
said
looking
him
full
in
the
face
again
you
do
suppose
my
husband
goes
out
with
me
in
the
morning
shopping
i
hope
he
has
something
better
to
do
should
you
like
to
have
your
mother
with
you
for
the
shopping
ah
dearly
then
with
a
little
quick
change
of
manner
another
time
not
this
season
but
next
if
i
can
persuade
her
to
come
for
next
year
i
hope
we
shall
be
more
settled
perhaps
in
a
house
of
our
own
if
phil
gets
the
appointment
he
is
after
oh
he
is
after
an
appointment
yes
john
phil
is
not
so
lucky
as
to
have
a
profession
like
you
this
was
a
new
way
of
looking
at
the
matter
and
john
tatham
found
nothing
to
say
it
seemed
to
him
who
had
worked
very
hard
for
it
a
little
droll
to
describe
his
possession
of
a
profession
as
luck
but
he
made
no
remark
he
took
elinor
and
found
her
brougham
for
her
and
the
kind
old
coachman
on
the
box
who
was
well
used
to
taking
care
of
her
though
only
hired
from
the
livery
stables
for
the
season
john
thought
the
old
man
looked
suspiciously
at
him
and
would
have
stopped
him
from
accompanying
her
had
he
designed
any
such
proceeding
poor
little
nelly
to
be
watched
over
by
the
paternal
on
the
box
she
who
might
have
had
but
he
stopped
himself
there
though
his
heart
felt
as
heavy
as
a
stone
to
see
her
go
away
thus
alone
from
the
smart
party
where
she
had
been
doing
duty
for
her
husband
john
could
not
take
upon
himself
to
finish
his
sentence
she
who
might
have
had
love
and
care
of
a
very
different
kind
no
he
had
never
offered
her
that
love
and
care
had
phil
compton
never
come
in
her
way
it
is
possible
that
john
tatham
might
never
have
offered
it
to
her
not
at
least
for
a
long
time
he
could
never
have
had
any
right
to
be
a
dog
in
the
manger
neither
would
he
venture
to
pretend
now
that
it
was
her
own
fault
if
she
had
chosen
the
wrong
man
was
it
his
fault
then
who
had
never
put
a
better
man
within
her
choice
but
john
who
was
no
coxcomb
blushed
in
the
dark
to
himself
as
this
question
flitted
through
his
mind
he
had
no
reason
to
suppose
that
elinor
would
have
been
willing
to
change
the
brotherly
tie
between
them
into
any
other
thank
heaven
for
that
brotherly
tie
he
would
always
be
able
to
befriend
her
to
stand
by
her
to
help
her
as
much
as
any
one
could
help
a
woman
who
was
married
and
thus
outside
of
all
ordinary
succour
and
as
for
that
blackguard
that
phil
but
here
john
who
was
a
man
of
just
mind
paused
again
for
a
man
to
let
his
wife
go
to
a
party
by
herself
was
not
after
all
so
dreadful
a
thing
many
men
did
so
and
the
women
did
not
complain
to
be
sure
they
were
generally
older
more
accustomed
to
manage
for
themselves
than
elinor
but
still
a
man
need
not
be
a
blackguard
because
he
did
that
so
john
stopped
his
own
ready
judgment
but
still
i
am
afraid
in
his
heart
pronounced
phil
sentence
all
the
same
he
did
not
say
a
word
about
this
encounter
to
dennistoun
at
least
he
did
tell
her
that
he
had
met
elinor
at
the
which
as
it
was
one
of
the
best
houses
in
london
was
pleasing
to
a
mother
to
hear
and
how
was
she
looking
dennistoun
cried
she
was
looking
beautiful
said
john
i
do
flatter
and
i
never
thought
her
so
in
the
old
times
but
it
is
the
only
word
i
can
use
did
i
tell
you
so
said
the
mother
pleased
she
is
quite
embellished
and
improved
therefore
she
must
be
happy
it
is
certainly
the
very
best
evidence
is
it
but
it
so
often
happens
otherwise
even
in
happy
marriages
a
girl
feels
strange
awkward
out
of
it
in
her
new
life
elinor
must
have
entirely
accustomed
herself
adapted
herself
to
it
and
to
them
or
she
would
not
look
so
well
that
is
the
greatest
comfort
i
can
have
and
john
kept
his
own
counsel
about
elinor
majestic
solitude
and
the
watchful
old
coachman
in
the
hired
brougham
her
husband
might
still
be
full
of
love
and
tenderness
all
the
same
it
was
a
great
effort
of
the
natural
integrity
of
his
character
to
pronounce
like
this
but
he
did
it
in
the
interests
of
justice
and
for
elinor
sake
and
her
mother
said
nothing
of
the
circumstances
at
all
it
may
be
supposed
that
when
elinor
paid
the
last
of
her
sudden
visits
at
the
cottage
it
was
a
heavy
moment
both
for
mother
and
daughter
it
was
the
time
when
fashionable
people
finish
the
season
by
going
to
goodwood
and
to
goodwood
elinor
was
going
with
a
party
lady
mariamne
and
a
number
of
the
set
she
told
her
mother
to
amuse
her
of
the
new
dresses
she
had
got
for
this
important
occasion
phil
says
one
may
go
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
the
remainder
of
the
year
but
we
must
be
fine
for
goodwood
she
said
i
wanted
him
to
believe
that
i
had
too
many
clothes
already
but
he
was
inexorable
it
is
not
often
is
it
that
one
husband
is
more
anxious
than
one
self
about
one
dress
he
wants
you
to
do
him
credit
elinor
well
mamma
there
is
no
harm
in
that
but
more
than
that
he
wants
me
to
look
nice
for
myself
he
thinks
me
still
a
little
shy
though
i
never
was
shy
was
i
and
he
thinks
nothing
gives
you
courage
like
feeling
yourself
well
dressed
but
he
takes
the
greatest
interest
in
everything
i
wear
and
where
do
you
go
after
goodwood
elinor
oh
mamma
on
such
a
round
of
visits
here
and
there
and
everywhere
i
do
know
and
the
tears
sprang
into
elinor
eyes
when
i
may
see
you
again
you
are
not
coming
back
to
london
said
the
mother
with
the
heart
sinking
in
her
breast
not
now
they
all
say
london
is
insupportable
it
is
one
of
the
things
that
everybody
says
and
i
believe
that
phil
will
not
set
foot
in
it
again
for
many
months
perhaps
i
might
get
a
moment
when
he
is
shooting
or
something
to
run
back
to
you
but
it
is
a
long
way
from
scotland
and
he
must
be
there
you
know
for
the
he
would
think
the
world
was
coming
to
an
end
if
he
did
not
get
a
shot
at
the
grouse
on
that
day
but
i
thought
he
was
looking
for
an
appointment
elinor
a
cloud
passed
over
elinor
face
the
season
is
over
she
said
and
all
the
opportunities
are
exhausted
and
we
do
speak
of
that
any
more
she
gave
her
mother
a
very
close
hug
at
the
railway
and
sat
with
her
head
partly
out
of
the
window
watching
her
as
she
stood
on
the
platform
until
the
train
turned
round
the
corner
no
relief
on
her
dear
face
now
but
an
anxious
strain
in
her
eyes
to
see
her
mother
as
long
as
possible
dennistoun
as
she
walked
again
slowly
up
the
hills
that
the
pony
might
not
suffer
said
to
herself
with
a
chill
at
her
heart
that
she
would
rather
have
seen
her
child
sinking
back
in
the
corner
pleased
that
it
was
over
as
on
the
first
day
chapter
xix
the
next
winter
was
more
dreary
still
and
solitary
than
the
first
at
windyhill
the
first
had
been
though
it
looked
so
long
and
dreary
as
it
passed
full
of
hope
of
the
coming
summer
which
must
it
seemed
bring
elinor
back
but
now
dennistoun
knew
exactly
what
elinor
coming
back
meant
and
the
prospect
was
less
cheering
three
days
in
the
whole
long
season
three
little
escapades
giving
so
very
little
hope
of
more
sustained
intercourse
to
come
dennistoun
going
over
all
the
circumstances
she
had
so
little
else
to
do
but
to
go
over
them
in
her
long
solitary
evenings
came
to
the
conclusion
that
whatever
might
happen
she
herself
would
go
to
town
when
summer
came
again
she
amused
herself
with
thinking
how
she
would
find
a
little
house
quite
a
small
house
as
there
are
so
many
in
a
good
situation
where
even
the
most
fashionable
need
not
be
ashamed
to
come
and
where
there
would
be
room
enough
for
elinor
and
her
husband
if
they
chose
to
establish
themselves
there
dennistoun
was
of
opinion
already
expressed
that
if
are
obnoxious
to
men
are
very
frequently
so
to
women
which
is
a
point
of
view
not
popularly
perceived
and
philip
compton
was
not
sympathetic
to
her
in
any
point
of
view
but
still
she
made
up
her
mind
to
endure
him
and
even
his
family
for
the
sake
of
elinor
she
planned
it
all
out
it
gave
a
little
occupation
to
the
vacant
time
how
they
should
have
their
separate
rooms
and
even
meals
if
that
turned
out
most
convenient
how
she
would
interfere
with
none
of
their
ways
only
to
have
her
elinor
under
her
roof
to
have
her
when
the
husband
was
occupied
in
the
evenings
if
there
were
any
evenings
that
she
spent
alone
in
the
mornings
when
perhaps
phil
got
up
late
or
had
engagements
of
his
own
for
the
moment
freedom
when
her
child
should
be
free
she
made
up
her
mind
that
she
would
ask
no
questions
would
never
interfere
with
any
of
their
habits
or
oppose
or
put
herself
between
them
only
just
to
have
a
little
of
elinor
every
day
for
it
will
not
be
the
same
thing
this
year
she
said
to
john
apologetically
they
have
quite
settled
down
into
each
other
ways
philip
must
see
i
have
no
intention
of
interfering
for
the
most
obdurate
opponent
of
could
not
think
could
he
john
that
i
had
any
desire
to
put
myself
between
them
or
make
myself
troublesome
now
there
is
no
telling
said
john
what
such
asses
might
think
but
philip
is
not
an
ass
and
do
you
think
i
have
behaved
very
well
and
may
give
myself
this
indulgence
the
second
year
i
certainly
think
you
will
be
quite
right
to
come
to
town
but
i
should
not
have
them
to
live
with
you
if
i
were
you
should
you
it
might
be
a
risk
but
then
i
should
do
it
unless
there
was
room
enough
to
leave
them
quite
free
the
thing
i
am
afraid
of
is
that
they
would
accept
oh
phil
compton
will
accept
said
john
hurriedly
why
are
you
so
sure
i
think
often
you
know
more
about
him
than
you
ever
say
i
do
know
much
about
him
but
i
know
that
a
man
of
uncertain
income
and
not
very
delicate
feelings
is
generally
glad
enough
to
have
the
expenses
of
the
season
taken
off
him
and
even
get
all
the
more
pleasure
out
of
it
when
he
has
his
living
free
that
not
a
very
elevated
view
to
take
of
the
transaction
john
my
dear
aunt
i
did
not
think
you
expected
anything
very
elevated
from
the
comptons
they
are
not
the
sort
of
family
from
which
one
expects
and
yet
it
is
the
family
that
my
elinor
belongs
to
she
is
a
compton
i
did
not
think
of
that
said
john
a
little
disconcerted
then
he
added
there
is
no
very
elevated
standard
in
such
matters
want
of
money
has
no
law
and
of
course
there
are
better
things
involved
for
he
might
be
very
glad
that
elinor
should
have
her
mother
to
go
out
with
her
to
stand
by
when
a
man
might
have
other
engagements
dennistoun
looked
at
him
closely
and
shook
her
head
she
was
not
very
much
reassured
by
this
view
of
the
case
at
all
events
i
shall
try
it
she
said
quite
early
in
the
year
when
she
was
expecting
no
such
pleasure
she
was
rewarded
for
her
patience
by
another
flying
visit
from
her
child
who
this
time
telegraphed
to
say
she
was
coming
so
that
her
mother
could
go
and
meet
her
at
the
station
and
thus
lose
no
moment
of
her
visit
elinor
however
was
not
in
good
spirits
on
this
occasion
nor
was
she
in
good
looks
she
told
her
mother
hurriedly
that
phil
had
come
up
upon
business
that
he
was
very
much
engaged
with
the
new
company
getting
far
more
into
it
than
satisfied
her
i
am
terrified
that
another
catastrophe
may
come
and
that
he
might
share
the
blame
if
things
were
to
go
wrong
which
was
by
no
means
a
good
preface
for
the
mission
with
which
it
afterwards
appeared
elinor
herself
was
charged
phil
told
me
to
say
to
you
mamma
that
if
you
were
not
satisfied
with
any
of
your
investments
he
could
help
you
to
a
good
six
or
seven
per
she
said
this
with
her
head
turned
away
gazing
out
of
the
window
contemplating
the
wintry
aspect
of
the
combe
with
a
countenance
as
cloudy
and
as
little
cheerful
as
itself
there
was
an
outcry
on
dennistoun
lips
but
fortunately
her
sympathy
with
her
child
was
so
strong
that
she
felt
elinor
sentiments
almost
more
forcibly
than
her
own
and
she
managed
to
answer
in
a
quiet
untroubled
voice
philip
is
very
kind
my
dear
but
you
know
my
investments
are
all
settled
for
me
and
i
have
no
will
of
my
own
i
get
less
interest
but
then
i
have
less
responsibility
do
you
know
i
belong
to
the
time
in
which
women
were
not
supposed
to
be
good
for
anything
and
consequently
i
am
in
the
hands
of
my
trustees
i
think
he
foresaw
that
mother
said
elinor
still
with
her
head
averted
and
her
eyes
far
away
but
he
thought
you
might
represent
to
the
trustees
that
not
only
would
it
give
you
more
money
but
it
would
be
better
in
the
end
for
me
oh
how
i
hate
to
have
to
say
this
to
you
mamma
how
steadily
dennistoun
kept
her
countenance
though
her
daughter
now
flung
herself
upon
her
shoulder
with
uncontrollable
tears
my
darling
it
is
quite
natural
you
should
say
it
you
must
tell
philip
that
i
fear
i
am
powerless
i
will
try
but
i
do
think
anything
will
come
of
it
i
have
been
glad
to
be
free
of
responsibility
and
i
have
never
attempted
to
interfere
mother
i
am
so
thankful
i
ought
to
go
against
him
ought
i
but
i
would
not
have
you
take
his
advice
it
is
so
dreadful
not
to
appear
my
dear
you
must
try
to
think
that
he
understands
better
than
you
do
men
generally
do
you
are
only
a
girl
and
they
are
trained
more
or
less
to
business
not
phil
not
phil
well
he
must
have
some
capacity
for
it
some
understanding
or
they
would
not
want
him
on
those
boards
and
you
can
not
have
elinor
for
you
know
nothing
about
it
to
hear
you
speak
of
per
cents
makes
me
laugh
it
was
a
somewhat
forlorn
kind
of
laugh
yet
the
mother
executed
it
finely
and
by
and
by
the
subject
dropped
and
elinor
was
turned
to
talk
of
other
things
other
things
of
which
there
was
a
great
deal
to
say
and
over
which
they
cried
and
laughed
together
as
nature
bade
in
the
same
evening
the
precious
evening
of
which
she
did
not
like
to
waste
a
moment
dennistoun
unfolded
her
plan
for
the
season
i
feel
that
i
know
exactly
the
kind
of
house
i
want
it
will
probably
be
in
some
quiet
insignificant
place
a
chapel
street
or
a
queen
street
or
a
park
street
somewhere
but
in
a
good
situation
you
shall
have
the
first
floor
all
to
yourself
to
receive
your
visitors
and
if
you
think
that
philip
would
prefer
a
separate
table
oh
mamma
mamma
cried
elinor
clinging
to
her
kissing
passionately
her
mother
cheek
which
was
still
as
soft
as
a
child
it
is
not
anything
you
have
told
me
now
that
has
put
this
into
my
head
my
darling
i
had
made
it
all
up
in
my
own
mind
then
you
know
when
your
husband
is
engaged
with
those
business
affairs
in
the
city
or
with
his
own
friends
you
would
have
your
mother
to
fall
back
upon
elinor
i
should
have
just
the
do
you
see
when
you
were
doing
nothing
else
when
you
were
wanted
for
nothing
else
i
promise
you
my
darling
i
should
never
be
and
would
never
interfere
oh
mamma
mamma
elinor
cried
again
as
if
words
failed
her
and
so
they
did
for
she
said
scarcely
anything
more
and
evaded
any
answer
it
went
to
her
mother
heart
yet
she
made
her
usual
excuses
for
it
poor
child
once
so
ready
to
decide
accepting
or
rejecting
with
the
certainty
that
no
opposition
would
be
made
to
her
will
but
now
afraid
to
commit
herself
to
say
anything
that
her
husband
would
not
approve
well
dennistoun
said
to
herself
many
a
young
wife
is
like
that
and
yet
is
happy
enough
it
depends
so
much
on
the
man
many
a
man
adores
his
wife
and
is
very
good
to
her
and
yet
can
not
bear
that
she
should
seem
to
settle
anything
without
consulting
his
whim
and
philip
compton
had
never
been
what
might
be
called
an
man
it
was
right
of
elinor
to
give
no
answer
till
she
knew
what
he
would
like
the
dreadful
thing
was
that
she
expressed
no
pleasure
in
her
proposal
scarcely
looked
as
if
she
herself
would
like
it
which
was
a
thing
which
did
give
an
unquestionable
wound
mamma
she
said
as
they
were
driving
to
the
station
not
in
the
pony
carriage
this
time
but
in
the
fly
for
the
weather
was
bad
do
be
vexed
that
i
do
say
more
about
your
wonderful
your
more
than
kind
offer
kind
is
scarcely
a
word
to
use
elinor
between
you
and
me
i
know
i
know
mamma
and
i
as
good
as
refuse
it
saying
nothing
oh
if
i
could
tell
you
without
telling
you
i
am
so
frightened
how
can
i
say
it
that
you
should
see
things
you
would
not
approve
my
dear
i
am
of
one
generation
and
you
are
of
another
i
am
an
old
woman
and
your
husband
is
a
young
man
but
what
does
that
matter
we
can
agree
to
differ
i
will
never
thrust
myself
into
his
private
affairs
and
he
oh
mother
mother
darling
it
is
not
that
elinor
said
and
she
went
away
without
any
decision
but
in
a
few
days
there
came
to
dennistoun
a
letter
from
philip
himself
most
nobly
expressed
saying
that
elinor
had
told
him
of
her
mother
kind
offer
and
that
he
hastened
to
accept
it
with
the
utmost
gratitude
and
devotion
he
had
just
been
wondering
he
wrote
how
he
was
to
muster
all
things
necessary
for
elinor
with
the
business
engagements
which
were
growing
upon
himself
nobody
could
understand
better
than
nell
good
mother
how
necessary
it
was
that
he
should
neglect
no
means
of
securing
their
position
and
he
had
found
that
often
he
would
have
to
leave
his
darling
by
herself
but
this
magnificent
this
magnanimous
offer
on
her
part
would
make
everything
right
need
he
say
how
gratefully
he
accepted
it
nell
and
he
being
on
the
spot
would
immediately
begin
looking
out
for
the
house
and
when
they
had
a
list
of
three
or
four
to
look
at
he
hoped
she
would
come
up
to
their
rooms
and
select
what
she
liked
best
this
response
took
away
dennistoun
breath
for
to
tell
the
truth
she
had
her
own
notions
as
to
the
house
she
wanted
and
as
to
the
time
to
be
spent
in
town
and
would
certainly
have
preferred
to
manage
everything
herself
but
in
this
she
had
to
yield
with
thankfulness
that
in
the
main
point
she
was
to
have
her
way
did
she
have
her
way
it
is
very
much
to
be
doubted
whether
in
such
a
situation
of
affairs
it
would
have
been
possible
the
house
that
was
decided
upon
was
not
one
which
she
would
have
chosen
for
herself
neither
would
she
have
taken
it
from
easter
to
july
she
had
meant
a
less
expensive
place
and
a
shorter
season
but
after
all
what
did
that
matter
for
once
if
it
pleased
elinor
the
worst
of
it
was
that
she
could
not
at
all
satisfy
herself
that
it
pleased
elinor
it
pleased
philip
there
was
no
doubt
but
then
it
had
not
been
intended
except
in
a
very
secondary
way
to
please
him
and
when
the
racket
of
the
season
began
dennistoun
had
a
good
deal
to
bear
philip
though
he
was
supposed
to
be
a
man
of
business
and
employed
in
the
city
got
up
about
noon
which
was
dreadful
to
all
her
orderly
country
habits
the
whole
afternoon
through
there
was
a
perpetual
tumult
of
visitors
who
when
by
chance
she
encountered
them
in
the
hall
or
on
the
stairs
looked
at
her
superciliously
as
if
she
were
the
landlady
the
man
who
opened
the
door
and
brushed
philip
compton
clothes
and
was
in
his
service
looked
superciliously
at
her
too
and
declined
to
have
anything
to
say
to
the
visitors
for
a
noise
of
laughter
and
loud
talk
was
distinctly
in
her
ears
from
noon
till
late
at
night
when
philip
came
home
always
much
later
than
his
wife
he
was
in
the
habit
of
bringing
men
with
him
whose
voices
rang
through
the
house
after
everybody
was
in
bed
to
be
sure
there
were
compensations
she
had
elinor
often
for
an
hour
or
two
in
the
morning
before
her
husband
was
up
she
had
her
in
the
evenings
when
they
were
not
going
out
but
these
were
few
as
for
philip
he
never
dined
at
home
when
he
had
no
engagements
he
dined
at
his
club
leaving
elinor
with
her
mother
he
gave
dennistoun
very
little
of
his
company
and
when
they
did
meet
there
was
in
his
manner
too
a
sort
of
reflection
of
the
superciliousness
of
the
smart
visitors
and
the
smart
servant
she
was
to
him
too
in
some
degree
the
landlady
the
old
lady
elinor
as
was
natural
redoubled
her
demonstrations
of
affection
her
excuses
and
sweet
words
to
make
up
for
this
neglect
but
all
the
time
there
was
in
her
mother
mind
that
dreadful
doubt
which
assails
us
when
we
have
committed
ourselves
to
one
act
or
another
was
it
wise
would
it
not
have
been
better
to
have
denied
herself
and
stayed
away
so
far
as
went
it
was
more
exercised
in
curzon
street
than
it
would
have
been
at
the
cottage
for
she
had
to
see
many
things
that
displeased
her
and
to
say
no
word
to
guess
at
the
tears
carefully
washed
away
from
elinor
eyes
and
to
ask
no
questions
and
to
see
what
she
could
not
but
feel
was
the
violent
career
downward
the
rush
that
must
lead
to
a
catastrophe
but
make
no
sign
there
was
one
evening
when
elinor
not
looking
well
or
feeling
well
had
stayed
at
home
philip
having
a
whole
long
list
of
engagements
in
hand
men
engagements
his
wife
explained
a
stockbroking
dinner
an
adjournment
to
somebody
chambers
a
prolonged
sitting
which
meant
play
and
a
great
deal
of
wine
and
other
attendant
circumstances
into
which
she
did
not
enter
elinor
had
no
engagement
for
that
night
and
was
free
to
be
petted
and
fêted
by
her
mother
she
was
put
at
her
ease
in
a
soft
and
rich
and
the
prettiest
little
dinner
served
and
the
room
filled
with
flowers
and
everything
done
that
used
to
be
done
when
she
was
recovering
from
some
little
mock
illness
some
child
malady
just
enough
to
show
how
dear
above
everything
was
the
child
to
the
mother
and
with
what
tender
ingenuity
the
mother
could
invent
new
delights
for
the
child
these
delights
alas
did
not
transport
elinor
now
as
they
once
had
done
and
yet
the
repose
was
sweet
and
the
comfort
of
this
nearest
and
dearest
friend
to
lean
upon
something
more
than
words
could
say
on
this
evening
however
in
the
quiet
of
those
still
hours
poor
elinor
heart
was
opened
or
rather
her
mouth
which
on
most
occasions
was
closed
so
firmly
she
said
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
something
quite
different
oh
i
wish
phil
was
not
so
much
engaged
with
those
dreadful
city
men
my
dear
said
dennistoun
who
was
thinking
of
far
other
things
and
then
she
said
there
surely
can
not
be
much
to
fear
in
that
respect
he
is
never
in
the
city
he
is
never
up
my
dear
when
the
city
men
are
doing
their
work
ah
said
elinor
i
do
think
that
matters
he
is
in
with
them
all
the
same
well
elinor
there
is
no
reason
that
there
should
be
any
harm
in
it
i
would
much
rather
he
had
some
real
business
in
hand
than
be
merely
a
butterfly
of
fashion
you
must
not
entertain
that
horror
of
city
men
the
kind
he
knows
are
different
from
the
kind
you
know
mamma
i
suppose
everything
is
different
from
what
it
was
in
my
time
but
it
need
not
be
any
worse
for
that
oh
mother
you
are
obstinate
in
thinking
well
of
everything
but
sometimes
i
am
so
frightened
i
feel
as
if
i
must
do
something
dreadful
myself
to
precipitate
the
ruin
which
nothing
i
can
do
will
stop
elinor
elinor
this
is
far
too
strong
language
mamma
he
wants
me
to
speak
to
you
again
he
wants
you
to
give
your
money
but
i
have
told
you
already
i
can
not
give
it
elinor
heaven
be
praised
for
that
but
he
will
speak
to
you
himself
he
will
perhaps
try
to
bully
you
mamma
elinor
it
is
horrible
what
i
say
yes
it
is
horrible
but
i
want
to
warn
you
he
says
things
nothing
that
he
can
say
will
make
me
forget
that
he
is
your
husband
elinor
ah
but
do
think
too
much
of
that
mamma
think
that
he
does
know
what
he
is
doing
poor
phil
oh
poor
phil
he
is
hurried
on
by
these
people
and
then
it
will
break
up
and
the
poor
people
will
be
ruined
and
they
will
upbraid
him
and
yet
he
will
not
be
a
whit
the
better
he
does
not
get
any
of
the
profit
i
can
see
it
all
as
clear
and
there
are
so
many
other
things
dennistoun
heart
sank
in
her
breast
for
she
too
knew
what
were
the
other
things
we
must
have
patience
she
said
he
is
in
his
full
of
high
spirits
and
thinking
everything
he
touches
must
go
right
he
will
steady
down
in
time
oh
i
am
not
complaining
cried
elinor
hurriedly
dashing
her
tears
away
if
you
were
not
a
dreadfully
good
mamma
if
you
would
grumble
sometimes
and
find
fault
that
i
might
defend
him
it
is
the
sight
of
you
there
seeing
everything
and
not
saying
a
word
that
is
too
much
for
me
then
i
will
grumble
elinor
i
will
even
say
something
to
him
for
our
own
credit
he
should
not
come
in
so
late
at
least
when
he
comes
in
he
should
come
in
to
rest
and
not
bring
men
with
him
to
make
a
noise
you
see
i
can
find
fault
as
much
as
heart
could
desire
i
am
dreadfully
selfish
i
do
mind
when
he
goes
out
now
and
then
without
you
for
then
i
have
you
but
he
should
not
bring
noisy
men
with
him
to
disturb
the
house
in
the
middle
of
the
night
i
think
i
will
speak
to
him
no
said
elinor
with
a
clutch
upon
her
mother
arm
no
do
do
that
he
does
not
like
to
be
found
fault
with
unless
in
the
case
if
you
were
giving
him
that
money
mother
which
i
can
not
do
and
elinor
my
darling
which
i
would
not
do
if
i
could
it
is
all
you
will
have
to
rely
upon
you
and
it
would
have
been
the
only
chance
said
elinor
i
do
say
it
would
have
been
much
of
a
chance
but
he
might
have
listened
if
oh
no
dear
mother
no
i
would
not
in
my
sober
senses
wish
that
you
should
give
him
a
penny
it
would
do
no
good
but
only
harm
and
yet
if
you
had
done
it
you
might
have
said
and
he
might
have
listened
to
you
for
once
chapter
xx
a
few
days
after
this
philip
compton
came
in
in
the
afternoon
to
the
little
room
which
dennistoun
had
made
into
a
for
herself
elinor
had
gone
out
with
her
and
her
mother
was
alone
it
was
a
very
rare
thing
indeed
for
dennistoun
guest
who
indeed
was
to
all
intents
and
purposes
the
master
of
the
house
and
had
probably
quite
forgotten
by
this
time
that
he
was
not
in
reality
so
to
pay
a
visit
had
a
distinct
meaning
in
the
compton
vocabulary
it
was
spoken
of
with
significance
and
with
a
laugh
as
something
half
hostile
half
ridiculous
it
meant
a
sort
of
absurd
criticism
and
inspection
as
of
some
old
crone
sitting
vigilant
spying
upon
everything
a
phil
cronies
thought
it
was
the
most
absurd
weakness
on
his
part
to
let
such
an
intruder
get
footing
in
his
house
you
will
never
get
rid
of
her
they
said
and
phil
though
he
was
generally
quite
civil
to
his
wife
mother
being
actually
and
at
his
heart
more
a
gentleman
than
he
had
the
least
idea
he
was
did
not
certainly
in
any
way
seek
her
society
he
scarcely
ever
dined
at
home
as
has
been
said
when
he
had
not
an
engagement
and
he
had
a
great
many
engagements
he
found
that
he
was
obliged
to
dine
at
his
club
on
the
evenings
when
he
might
have
been
free
and
as
this
was
the
only
meal
which
was
supposed
to
be
common
it
may
be
perceived
that
phil
had
little
means
of
meeting
his
and
that
he
should
come
to
see
her
of
his
own
free
will
was
unprecedented
phil
compton
had
not
improved
since
his
marriage
his
nocturnal
enjoyments
the
noisy
parties
in
the
middle
of
the
night
had
not
helped
to
dissipate
the
effect
of
the
anxieties
of
the
city
which
his
wife
so
deplored
dennistoun
that
very
day
when
she
came
in
the
fresh
summer
morning
to
her
early
breakfast
had
seen
through
an
open
door
the
room
which
was
appropriated
to
phil
with
a
lamp
still
burning
in
the
daylight
cards
lying
strewn
about
the
floor
and
all
in
that
direful
disorder
which
a
room
so
occupied
overnight
shows
in
the
clear
eye
of
the
day
the
aspect
of
the
room
had
given
her
a
shock
almost
more
startling
than
any
moral
certainty
as
was
natural
to
a
woman
used
to
all
the
decorums
and
delicacies
of
a
life
there
is
no
sin
in
going
late
to
bed
or
even
letting
a
lamp
burn
into
the
day
but
the
impression
that
such
a
sight
makes
even
upon
the
careless
is
always
greater
than
any
mere
apprehension
by
the
mind
of
the
midnight
sitting
the
eager
game
the
chances
of
loss
and
ruin
she
had
not
been
able
to
get
that
sight
out
of
her
eyes
though
on
ordinary
occasions
she
never
entered
rooms
on
this
she
had
stolen
in
to
put
out
the
lamp
with
the
sensation
in
her
mind
of
destroying
some
evidence
against
him
which
someone
less
interested
than
she
might
have
used
to
his
disadvantage
and
she
had
sent
up
the
housemaid
to
do
the
room
with
an
admonition
i
can
not
have
compton
rooms
neglected
she
said
the
gentlemen
is
always
so
late
the
housemaid
said
in
i
hears
them
let
themselves
out
sometimes
after
we
all
up
i
do
want
to
hear
anything
about
the
gentlemen
do
your
work
at
the
proper
time
that
is
all
that
is
asked
of
you
phil
servant
appeared
at
the
moment
pulling
on
his
coat
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
has
been
up
half
the
night
which
indeed
was
the
case
for
the
gentlemen
when
they
came
in
had
various
wants
that
had
to
be
supplied
what
up
now
he
said
to
the
housemaid
within
hearing
of
her
mistress
casting
an
insolent
look
at
the
old
lady
who
belonged
to
she
been
prying
and
spying
about
like
they
all
do
dennistoun
had
retreated
within
the
shelter
of
her
room
to
escape
the
end
of
this
sentence
which
still
she
heard
with
the
usual
quickness
of
our
faculties
in
such
cases
she
swallowed
her
simple
breakfast
with
what
appetite
she
might
and
her
stout
spirit
for
the
moment
broke
down
before
this
insult
which
was
ridiculous
she
said
to
herself
from
a
saucy
what
did
it
matter
to
her
what
johnson
did
or
said
but
it
was
like
the
lamp
burning
in
the
sunshine
it
gave
a
moral
shock
more
sharp
than
many
a
thing
of
much
more
importance
would
have
been
capable
of
doing
and
she
had
not
been
able
to
get
over
it
all
day
it
may
be
supposed
therefore
that
it
was
an
unfortunate
moment
for
phil
compton
visit
dennistoun
had
scarcely
seen
them
that
day
and
she
was
sitting
by
herself
somewhat
sick
at
heart
wondering
if
anything
would
break
the
routine
into
which
their
life
was
falling
or
if
this
was
what
elinor
must
address
herself
to
as
its
usual
tenor
it
would
be
better
in
the
country
she
said
to
herself
it
was
only
in
the
bustle
of
the
season
when
everybody
of
his
kind
was
congregated
in
town
that
it
would
be
like
this
in
their
rounds
of
visits
or
when
the
whole
day
was
occupied
with
sport
such
nocturnal
sittings
would
be
impossible
and
she
comforted
herself
by
thinking
that
they
would
not
be
consistent
with
any
serious
business
in
the
city
such
as
elinor
feared
the
one
danger
must
push
away
the
other
he
could
not
gamble
at
night
in
that
way
and
gamble
in
the
other
among
the
stockbrokers
they
were
both
ruinous
no
doubt
but
they
could
not
both
be
carried
on
at
the
same
time
or
so
at
least
this
innocent
woman
thought
there
was
enough
to
be
anxious
and
alarmed
about
without
taking
two
impossible
dangers
into
her
mind
together
and
just
then
phil
knocked
at
her
door
he
came
in
smiling
and
gracious
and
with
that
look
of
high
breeding
and
which
had
conciliated
her
before
and
which
she
felt
the
influence
of
now
although
she
was
aware
how
many
drawbacks
there
were
and
knew
that
the
respect
which
her
showed
was
far
from
genuine
i
never
see
you
to
have
a
chat
he
said
i
thought
i
would
take
the
opportunity
when
elinor
was
out
i
want
you
to
tell
me
how
you
think
she
is
i
think
she
is
wonderfully
well
said
dennistoun
well
you
mean
considering
that
there
is
too
much
racket
in
her
life
partly
i
mean
that
but
indeed
i
meant
it
without
condition
she
is
wonderfully
well
i
am
surprised
often
it
is
rather
a
racket
of
a
life
said
phil
too
much
indeed
it
is
too
much
for
a
woman
who
is
beginning
her
serious
life
but
if
you
think
that
it
is
a
great
thing
gained
for
you
can
put
a
stop
to
it
or
moderate
pace
do
you
call
it
she
said
with
a
smile
well
yes
i
suppose
we
could
moderate
the
pace
but
that
would
mean
a
great
deal
for
me
you
see
when
a
man
launched
it
is
always
so
easy
to
stop
nell
of
course
if
you
thought
she
wanted
it
might
go
to
the
country
with
you
dennistoun
heart
gave
a
leap
might
go
to
the
country
with
you
it
seemed
a
glimpse
of
paradise
that
burst
upon
her
but
then
she
shook
her
head
you
know
elinor
would
not
leave
you
philip
well
she
has
a
ridiculous
partiality
he
said
with
a
laugh
though
of
course
i
make
her
if
it
was
really
for
her
advantage
he
added
after
a
moment
you
do
think
i
let
that
stand
in
her
way
in
the
meantime
said
dennistoun
with
hesitation
without
proceeding
to
any
such
stringent
measures
if
you
could
manage
to
be
a
little
less
late
at
night
oh
you
listen
for
my
coming
in
at
night
his
face
took
a
sombre
look
as
if
a
cloud
had
come
over
it
i
do
not
listen
for
happily
for
me
i
have
been
asleep
for
hours
i
generally
jump
up
thinking
the
house
is
on
fire
at
the
sound
of
voices
which
make
listening
quite
unnecessary
philip
ah
yes
the
fellows
are
rather
noisy
he
said
carelessly
but
nell
sleeps
like
a
top
and
pays
no
attention
which
is
the
best
thing
she
can
do
i
would
not
be
too
sure
she
slept
like
a
top
it
true
women
are
all
hypocrites
alike
you
never
know
when
you
have
them
phil
said
and
then
there
was
a
pause
for
she
feared
to
say
anything
more
lest
she
should
go
too
far
and
he
for
once
in
his
life
was
embarrassed
and
did
not
know
how
to
begin
what
he
had
to
say
well
he
said
quickly
getting
up
i
must
be
going
i
have
business
in
the
city
and
now
that
i
find
you
satisfied
about
health
by
the
way
you
never
show
in
our
rooms
though
nell
spends
every
minute
she
has
to
spare
here
i
am
a
little
old
perhaps
for
your
friends
philip
and
the
room
is
not
too
large
well
no
he
said
they
are
wretched
little
rooms
then
glad
you
think
nell
is
all
right
was
this
all
he
meant
to
say
there
was
however
an
uncertainty
about
his
step
and
by
the
time
he
had
opened
the
door
he
came
to
a
pause
half
closed
it
again
and
said
oh
by
the
bye
what
is
it
said
dennistoun
he
closed
the
door
again
and
came
back
half
a
step
i
almost
forgot
i
meant
to
tell
you
if
you
have
any
money
to
invest
i
could
help
you
to
the
best
thing
i
heard
of
for
many
a
day
you
are
very
kind
philip
but
you
know
everything
i
have
is
in
the
hands
of
trustees
oh
bother
trustees
the
only
thing
they
do
is
to
keep
your
dividends
down
to
the
lowest
amount
possible
and
cut
short
your
income
come
you
quite
old
enough
to
judge
for
yourself
you
might
give
them
a
jog
at
your
time
of
life
they
ought
to
take
a
hint
from
you
i
have
never
done
it
philip
and
they
would
pay
no
attention
to
me
oh
nonsense
mamma
why
except
you
who
has
a
right
to
be
consulted
except
nell
and
if
i
her
husband
am
your
adviser
i
know
they
would
do
nothing
but
mock
at
me
rubbish
i
like
to
see
who
would
mock
at
you
just
you
send
them
to
me
that
is
all
philip
will
you
not
believe
me
when
i
say
that
it
is
impossible
i
have
never
interfered
they
would
ask
what
made
me
think
of
such
a
thing
now
and
you
could
tell
them
a
jolly
good
opportunity
as
safe
as
the
bank
and
paying
six
or
seven
per
none
of
your
fabulous
risky
ten
or
twelve
businesses
but
a
solid
steady
how
could
it
be
to
my
interest
to
mislead
you
it
would
be
nell
who
would
be
the
loser
i
should
be
simply
cutting
off
my
own
head
that
is
true
no
doubt
and
he
said
scarcely
waiting
for
her
reply
nell
is
really
the
person
who
should
be
consulted
for
if
there
was
loss
eventually
it
would
come
upon
her
and
so
upon
me
i
mean
taking
into
consideration
all
the
chances
of
the
future
for
it
is
perfectly
safe
for
your
time
you
may
be
quite
sure
of
that
no
one
though
he
might
be
ninety
likes
to
have
his
time
limited
and
his
heir
prospects
dwelt
upon
as
the
only
things
of
any
importance
and
dennistoun
was
a
very
long
way
from
ninety
she
would
have
sacrificed
everything
she
had
to
make
her
child
happy
but
she
did
not
like
all
the
same
to
be
set
down
as
unimportant
so
far
as
her
own
property
was
concerned
i
am
afraid
she
said
with
a
slight
quaver
in
her
voice
that
my
trustees
would
not
take
elinor
wishes
into
consideration
in
the
first
place
nor
yours
either
philip
they
think
of
me
and
i
suppose
that
is
really
their
duty
if
i
had
anything
of
my
own
do
you
mean
to
say
he
said
bluntly
that
with
a
good
income
and
living
in
the
country
in
a
hole
in
the
most
obscure
way
you
have
saved
nothing
all
these
years
if
i
had
said
dennistoun
roused
by
his
persistent
attack
i
should
be
very
sorry
to
fling
it
away
oh
that
is
what
you
think
he
said
now
we
at
the
bottom
of
it
you
think
that
to
put
it
in
my
hands
would
be
to
throw
it
away
i
thought
there
must
be
something
at
the
bottom
of
all
this
pretty
ignorance
of
business
and
so
forth
good
gracious
that
may
be
well
enough
for
a
girl
but
when
a
grandmother
pretends
not
to
know
not
to
interfere
that
too
much
so
this
is
what
you
meant
all
the
time
to
put
it
into
my
hands
would
be
throwing
it
away
i
did
not
mean
to
say
so
philip
i
spoke
hastily
but
i
must
remind
you
that
i
am
not
accustomed
to
this
tone
oh
no
not
at
all
accustomed
to
it
you
all
say
that
that
dodge
never
was
used
to
anything
of
the
kind
never
had
a
rough
word
said
to
her
and
so
forth
and
so
forth
philip
i
hope
you
do
say
rough
words
to
my
elinor
oh
he
said
i
have
got
you
there
have
i
elinor
no
more
yours
than
she
is
johnson
she
is
my
nell
and
what
more
cling
to
me
whatever
rough
words
i
may
say
or
however
you
may
coax
or
wheedle
do
you
ever
think
when
you
refuse
to
make
a
sacrifice
of
one
scrap
of
your
hoards
for
her
that
if
i
were
not
a
husband
in
a
hundred
i
might
take
it
out
of
her
and
make
her
pay
for
what
said
dennistoun
standing
up
and
confronting
him
her
face
pale
her
head
very
erect
for
what
would
you
make
her
pay
he
stood
staring
at
her
for
a
moment
and
then
he
broke
out
into
a
laugh
we
need
face
each
other
as
if
we
were
going
to
have
a
fight
he
said
and
it
would
be
fair
mamma
we
not
equally
matched
the
knowing
ones
would
all
lay
their
money
on
you
so
you
take
my
advice
about
investing
your
spare
cash
well
if
you
wo
you
wo
and
there
an
end
of
it
only
stand
up
fair
and
do
bother
me
with
nonsense
about
trustees
it
is
no
nonsense
she
said
his
eyes
flashed
but
he
controlled
himself
and
turned
away
waving
his
hand
i
not
beat
nell
for
it
when
i
come
home
he
said
once
more
phil
dined
at
his
club
that
evening
and
elinor
with
her
mother
she
was
in
an
eager
and
excited
state
looking
anxiously
in
dennistoun
eyes
but
it
was
not
till
late
in
the
evening
that
she
made
any
remark
at
last
just
before
they
parted
for
the
night
she
threw
herself
upon
her
mother
with
a
little
cry
oh
mamma
i
know
you
are
right
i
know
you
are
quite
right
but
if
you
could
have
done
it
it
would
have
given
you
an
influence
i
do
blame
you
not
for
a
moment
but
it
might
have
given
you
an
opening
to
speak
it
might
have
given
you
a
little
hold
on
him
my
darling
my
darling
said
dennistoun
no
said
elinor
there
nothing
to
pity
me
about
nothing
at
all
phil
is
always
kind
and
good
to
me
but
you
would
have
had
a
standing
ground
it
might
have
given
you
a
right
to
speak
about
those
dreadful
dreadful
city
complications
mamma
dennistoun
went
to
bed
that
night
a
troubled
woman
and
lay
awake
watching
and
expecting
when
the
usual
midnight
tumult
should
arise
but
that
evening
there
was
none
no
sound
but
the
key
in
the
latch
the
shutting
of
a
door
or
two
and
all
quiet
compunctions
filled
the
mother
heart
what
was
the
wrong
if
perhaps
she
could
satisfy
elinor
perhaps
get
at
the
heart
of
phil
who
had
a
heart
though
it
was
getting
strangled
in
all
those
intricacies
of
gambling
and
wretched
business
she
turned
over
and
over
in
her
mind
all
that
she
had
and
all
that
she
had
any
power
over
and
she
remembered
a
small
sum
she
had
in
a
mortgage
which
was
after
all
in
her
own
power
no
doubt
it
would
be
to
throw
the
money
away
which
would
be
so
much
gone
from
the
future
provision
of
elinor
but
if
by
that
means
she
could
acquire
an
influence
as
elinor
said
be
allowed
to
speak
to
protest
or
perhaps
even
insist
upon
a
change
of
course
thinking
over
such
a
question
for
a
whole
sleepless
night
and
feeling
beneath
all
that
at
least
at
worst
this
sacrifice
would
give
pleasure
to
elinor
which
was
really
the
one
and
sole
motive
the
only
thing
that
could
give
her
any
warrant
for
such
a
proceeding
is
not
a
process
which
is
likely
to
strengthen
the
mind
in
the
morning
as
soon
as
she
knew
he
was
up
which
was
not
till
late
enough
she
sent
to
ask
if
phil
would
give
her
five
minutes
before
he
went
out
he
appeared
after
a
while
extremely
correct
and
grave
but
polite
i
must
ask
you
to
excuse
me
he
said
if
i
am
hurried
for
is
one
of
my
board
days
it
was
only
to
say
philip
you
spoke
to
me
yesterday
of
money
to
be
invested
yes
he
said
politely
without
moving
a
muscle
i
have
been
thinking
it
all
over
and
i
remember
that
there
is
a
thousand
pounds
or
two
which
john
tatham
placed
for
me
in
a
mortgage
and
which
is
in
my
own
power
ah
he
said
a
thousand
pounds
or
two
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
it
is
scarcely
worth
while
is
it
changing
an
investment
for
so
small
a
matter
as
a
thousand
pounds
if
you
think
so
philip
it
is
all
i
can
think
of
that
is
in
my
own
power
it
is
really
not
worth
the
trouble
he
said
and
i
am
in
a
hurry
he
made
a
step
towards
the
door
and
then
turned
round
again
well
he
said
just
to
show
there
is
no
i
find
you
something
perhaps
to
put
your
in
and
then
there
was
john
tatham
to
face
after
that
chapter
xxi
it
cost
dennistoun
a
struggle
to
yield
to
her
daughter
and
her
daughter
husband
and
with
her
eyes
open
and
no
delusion
on
the
subject
to
throw
away
her
two
thousand
pounds
two
thousand
pounds
is
a
big
thing
to
throw
away
there
are
many
people
much
richer
than
dennistoun
who
would
have
thought
it
a
wicked
thing
to
do
and
some
who
would
have
quarrelled
with
both
daughter
and
rather
than
do
so
foolish
a
thing
for
it
was
not
merely
making
a
present
so
to
speak
of
the
money
it
was
throwing
it
away
to
have
given
it
to
elinor
would
have
been
nothing
it
would
have
been
a
pleasure
but
in
investment
dennistoun
had
no
confidence
it
was
throwing
her
money
after
elinor
money
into
that
hungry
sea
which
swallows
up
everything
and
gives
nothing
again
but
if
that
had
been
difficult
for
her
it
may
be
imagined
with
what
feelings
she
contemplated
her
necessary
meeting
with
john
tatham
she
knew
everything
he
would
say
more
she
knew
what
he
would
look
his
astonishment
his
indignation
the
amazement
with
which
he
would
regard
it
john
was
far
from
being
incapable
of
a
sacrifice
dennistoun
indeed
did
him
more
than
justice
in
that
respect
for
she
believed
that
he
had
himself
been
on
the
eve
of
asking
elinor
to
marry
him
when
she
was
snatched
up
by
oh
so
much
less
satisfactory
a
man
which
the
reader
knows
is
not
quite
the
case
though
perhaps
it
required
quite
as
much
on
john
part
to
stand
by
elinor
and
maintain
her
cause
under
her
altered
circumstances
as
if
it
had
been
the
case
but
notwithstanding
this
she
knew
that
john
would
be
angry
with
what
she
had
done
or
promised
to
do
and
would
put
every
possible
impediment
in
her
way
and
when
she
sent
for
him
in
order
that
she
might
carry
out
her
promise
it
was
with
a
heart
as
sick
with
fright
and
as
much
disturbed
by
the
idea
of
a
scolding
as
ever
child
was
john
had
been
very
little
to
the
house
at
curzon
street
he
had
dined
two
or
three
times
with
dennistoun
alone
and
once
or
twice
elinor
had
been
of
the
party
but
the
comptons
had
never
any
guests
at
that
house
and
the
fact
already
mentioned
that
philip
compton
never
dined
at
home
made
it
a
difficult
matter
for
dennistoun
to
ask
any
but
her
oldest
friends
to
the
curious
little
divided
house
which
was
neither
hers
nor
theirs
thus
cousin
john
had
met
but
no
more
husband
and
neither
of
the
gentlemen
had
shown
the
least
desire
to
cultivate
the
acquaintance
john
had
not
expressed
his
sentiments
on
the
subject
to
any
one
but
phil
as
was
natural
had
been
more
demonstrative
i
do
think
much
of
your
relations
nell
he
said
if
that
a
specimen
a
prig
if
ever
there
was
one
and
that
old
sheep
that
was
at
the
wedding
the
father
of
him
i
suppose
as
they
are
my
relations
phil
you
might
speak
of
them
a
little
more
respectfully
oh
respectfully
bless
us
all
i
have
no
respect
for
my
own
and
why
i
should
have
for
yours
my
little
dear
i
confess
i
ca
see
oh
by
the
way
this
is
cousin
john
who
i
used
to
think
by
your
blushing
and
all
that
phil
i
think
you
are
trying
to
make
me
angry
cousin
john
is
the
best
man
in
the
world
but
i
never
blushed
how
ridiculous
i
might
as
well
have
blushed
to
speak
of
my
brother
i
put
no
confidence
in
brothers
unless
they
real
ones
said
phil
but
i
glad
i
seen
him
nell
i
doubt
after
all
that
you
such
a
fool
when
you
see
us
together
eh
he
laughed
that
laugh
of
conscious
superiority
which
when
it
is
not
perfectly
sounds
so
fatuous
to
the
hearer
elinor
did
not
look
at
him
she
turned
her
head
away
and
made
no
reply
john
on
his
part
as
has
been
said
made
no
remark
if
he
had
possessed
a
wife
at
home
to
whom
he
could
have
confided
his
sentiments
as
phil
compton
had
it
is
possible
that
he
might
have
said
something
not
unsimilar
but
then
had
he
had
a
wife
at
home
he
would
have
been
more
indifferent
to
phil
and
might
not
have
cared
to
criticise
him
at
all
dennistoun
received
him
when
he
came
in
obedience
to
her
call
as
a
child
might
do
who
had
the
power
of
receiving
its
future
corrector
she
abased
herself
before
him
servilely
choosing
his
favourite
subjects
talking
of
what
she
thought
would
please
him
of
former
times
at
the
cottage
of
elinor
and
her
great
affection
for
cousin
john
and
so
forth
i
imagine
that
he
had
a
suspicion
of
the
cause
of
all
this
sweetness
he
looked
at
her
suspiciously
though
he
allowed
himself
to
be
drawn
into
reminiscences
and
to
feel
a
half
pleasure
half
pain
in
the
affectionate
things
that
elinor
had
said
at
length
after
some
time
had
passed
he
asked
in
a
pause
of
the
conversation
was
this
all
you
wanted
with
me
aunt
to
talk
of
old
times
was
it
a
good
enough
pretext
for
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
john
he
laughed
a
little
and
shook
his
head
an
excellent
pretext
where
none
was
wanted
it
is
very
kind
of
you
to
think
it
a
pleasure
but
you
had
something
also
to
say
it
seems
there
is
no
deceiving
you
john
she
said
and
with
many
hesitations
and
much
difficulty
told
him
her
story
she
saw
him
begin
to
flame
she
saw
his
eyes
light
up
and
dennistoun
shook
in
her
chair
she
was
not
a
woman
apt
to
be
afraid
but
she
was
frightened
now
nevertheless
when
she
had
finished
her
story
john
at
first
spoke
no
word
and
when
he
did
find
a
tongue
it
was
only
to
say
you
want
to
get
back
the
money
you
have
on
that
mortgage
my
dear
aunt
why
did
not
you
tell
me
so
at
once
but
i
have
just
told
you
john
well
so
be
it
you
know
it
will
take
a
little
time
there
are
some
formalities
that
must
be
gone
through
you
can
not
make
a
demand
on
people
in
that
way
to
pay
you
cash
at
once
oh
i
thought
it
was
so
easy
to
get
money
on
such
very
good
security
and
paying
such
a
good
adequate
rate
of
interest
it
is
easy
he
said
perfectly
easy
but
it
wants
a
little
time
and
people
will
naturally
wonder
if
it
is
really
good
security
and
good
interest
why
you
should
be
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
out
of
it
but
surely
to
say
private
reasons
family
reasons
that
will
be
enough
oh
there
is
no
occasion
for
giving
any
reason
at
all
you
wish
to
do
it
that
is
reason
enough
yes
said
dennistoun
with
diffidence
yet
also
a
little
i
think
it
is
enough
of
course
of
course
but
his
eyes
were
flaming
and
dennistoun
would
not
allow
herself
to
believe
that
she
had
got
off
and
may
i
ask
not
that
i
have
any
right
to
ask
for
of
course
you
have
better
advisers
what
do
you
mean
to
put
the
money
in
when
you
have
got
it
back
oh
john
said
dennistoun
you
are
implacable
though
you
pretend
different
you
know
what
i
want
with
the
money
and
you
disapprove
of
it
and
so
do
i
am
going
to
throw
it
away
i
know
that
just
as
well
as
you
do
and
i
am
ashamed
of
myself
but
i
am
going
to
do
it
all
the
same
you
are
going
to
give
it
to
elinor
i
do
think
there
is
anything
to
disapprove
of
in
that
it
is
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
if
i
could
be
sure
that
elinor
would
get
any
good
by
it
she
said
and
then
his
face
suddenly
blazed
up
so
that
the
former
flame
in
his
eyes
was
nothing
he
sat
for
a
moment
staring
at
her
and
then
he
said
yes
if
but
i
suppose
you
take
the
risk
there
were
a
great
many
things
on
his
lips
to
say
but
he
said
none
of
them
except
hurriedly
you
have
a
motive
i
suppose
i
have
a
motive
as
futile
probably
as
my
act
if
i
could
by
that
means
or
any
other
acquire
an
influence
john
was
very
seldom
if
ever
rude
it
was
not
in
his
way
but
at
this
moment
he
was
so
bitterly
exasperated
that
he
forgot
his
manners
altogether
he
burst
out
into
a
loud
laugh
and
then
he
jumped
up
to
his
feet
and
said
forgive
me
i
really
have
a
dozen
engagements
i
stay
i
see
to
having
this
business
done
for
you
as
soon
as
possible
you
would
rather
old
lynch
had
no
hand
in
it
i
get
it
done
for
you
at
once
she
followed
him
out
to
the
door
as
if
they
had
been
in
the
country
and
that
the
flowery
cottage
door
with
the
great
world
of
down
and
sky
outside
instead
of
curzon
street
longing
to
say
something
that
would
still
at
the
last
moment
gain
her
john
approval
or
his
understanding
at
least
but
she
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
he
had
promised
to
manage
it
all
for
her
he
had
not
reproached
her
and
yet
not
content
with
that
she
wanted
to
extort
a
favourable
word
from
him
before
he
should
go
but
she
could
not
find
a
word
to
say
he
it
was
only
who
spoke
he
asked
when
she
was
going
to
return
home
with
his
hand
upon
the
street
door
i
do
know
i
have
not
made
any
plans
the
house
is
taken
till
july
and
you
have
enjoyed
it
he
said
it
has
answered
what
a
cruel
cruel
question
to
put
to
her
she
going
so
unsuspectingly
with
him
to
the
very
door
philip
compton
servant
always
about
when
he
was
not
wanted
spying
about
to
see
whom
it
was
that
was
letting
out
came
strolling
into
sight
anyhow
whether
that
was
the
reason
or
not
she
made
him
no
reply
he
caught
her
look
a
look
that
said
more
than
words
and
turned
round
quickly
and
held
out
his
hand
i
did
not
mean
to
be
cruel
he
said
oh
no
no
no
you
did
not
mean
it
you
were
not
cruel
the
reverse
you
are
always
so
kind
yes
it
has
answered
i
am
more
glad
than
i
can
tell
you
that
i
came
he
it
was
now
that
looked
at
her
anxiously
while
she
smiled
that
smile
which
is
kept
for
people
in
trouble
she
went
in
afterwards
and
sat
silent
for
some
time
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
in
which
attitude
elinor
found
her
after
her
afternoon
visitors
had
gone
away
what
is
it
mother
what
is
it
dear
mother
something
has
happened
to
vex
you
nothing
nothing
elinor
john
tatham
has
been
here
he
is
going
to
do
that
little
piece
of
business
for
me
and
he
has
been
bullying
you
too
poor
mamma
on
the
contrary
he
did
not
say
a
word
he
considered
it
quite
natural
elinor
gave
her
mother
a
kiss
she
had
nothing
to
say
neither
of
them
had
a
word
to
say
to
the
other
the
thought
that
passed
through
both
their
minds
was
after
all
it
is
only
two
thousand
pounds
and
then
was
elinor
thought
and
then
never
more
never
more
was
what
passed
through
dennistoun
mind
phil
compton
smiled
upon
her
that
day
she
handed
him
over
the
money
it
is
a
great
pity
you
took
the
trouble
he
said
it
is
a
pity
to
change
an
investment
for
such
a
bagatelle
as
two
thousand
pounds
still
if
you
insist
upon
it
mamma
i
suppose
nell
been
bragging
of
the
big
interest
but
you
never
will
feel
it
on
a
scrap
like
this
if
you
would
let
me
double
your
income
for
you
now
you
know
philip
i
can
not
the
trustees
would
never
consent
bother
trustees
they
are
the
ruin
of
women
he
said
and
as
he
left
the
room
he
turned
back
to
ask
her
how
long
she
was
going
to
stay
in
town
how
long
do
you
stay
oh
till
goodwood
always
said
phil
nell
looking
forward
to
it
and
there
generally
some
good
things
just
at
the
end
when
the
heavy
people
have
gone
away
but
i
thought
you
might
not
care
to
stay
so
long
i
came
not
for
town
but
for
elinor
philip
exactly
so
but
do
you
think
elinor
has
shown
herself
quite
able
to
take
care
of
herself
not
to
say
that
she
has
me
it
a
thousand
pities
to
keep
you
from
the
country
which
you
prefer
especially
as
after
all
nell
can
be
so
little
with
you
it
would
be
much
better
for
her
at
present
philip
to
come
with
me
and
rest
at
home
while
you
go
to
goodwood
for
the
sake
of
the
future
you
ought
to
persuade
her
to
do
it
i
daresay
try
yourself
to
persuade
her
to
leave
me
she
wo
you
know
but
why
should
you
bore
yourself
to
death
staying
on
here
you
do
like
it
and
nobody
wants
me
you
mean
philip
i
never
said
anything
so
dashed
straightforward
i
am
not
a
chap
of
that
kind
but
what
i
say
is
it
a
shame
to
keep
you
hanging
on
disturbed
in
your
rest
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
that
noisy
beggar
dismar
that
came
in
with
us
last
night
must
have
woke
you
up
with
his
idiotic
bellowing
it
does
matter
for
me
but
elinor
philip
it
does
matter
for
your
wife
if
her
rest
is
broken
it
will
react
upon
her
in
every
way
i
wish
you
would
consent
to
forego
those
visitors
in
the
middle
of
the
night
he
looked
at
her
with
a
sort
of
satirical
indifference
sorry
i
oblige
you
he
said
when
a
girl
friends
fork
out
handsomely
a
man
has
some
reason
for
paying
a
little
attention
but
when
there
nothing
or
next
to
nothing
on
her
side
why
of
course
he
must
pick
up
a
little
where
he
can
as
much
for
her
sake
as
his
own
pick
up
a
little
said
dennistoun
i
wish
you
would
repeat
what
i
say
like
that
it
makes
a
fellow
nervous
yes
of
course
a
man
that
knows
what
he
about
does
pick
up
a
little
about
your
movements
however
i
advise
you
to
take
my
advice
and
go
back
to
your
snug
little
house
it
would
kill
me
in
a
week
but
i
know
it
suits
you
why
hang
on
for
nell
she
as
well
as
can
be
and
there
a
few
things
that
it
would
be
good
for
us
to
do
which
you
can
not
do
while
i
am
here
is
that
what
you
mean
philip
i
never
saw
any
good
in
being
what
the
french
call
brutal
he
said
i
hate
making
a
woman
cry
or
that
sort
of
thing
but
you
a
woman
of
sense
and
i
sure
you
must
see
that
a
young
couple
like
nell
and
me
who
have
our
way
to
make
in
the
world
you
know
it
was
for
her
sake
entirely
that
i
came
here
yes
oh
yes
to
do
coddling
and
that
sort
of
thing
which
she
require
a
bit
but
if
i
must
be
brutal
you
know
there
things
of
much
consequence
we
could
do
if
if
what
philip
well
he
said
turning
on
his
heel
if
we
had
the
house
to
ourselves
this
was
the
influence
dennistoun
hoped
to
acquire
by
the
sacrifice
of
her
two
thousand
pounds
when
he
was
gone
instead
of
covering
her
face
as
she
had
done
when
john
left
her
dennistoun
stared
into
the
vacant
air
for
a
minute
and
then
she
burst
into
a
laugh
it
was
not
a
mirthful
laugh
it
may
be
supposed
or
harmonious
and
it
startled
her
as
she
heard
it
pealing
into
the
silence
whether
it
was
loud
enough
to
wake
elinor
or
whether
she
was
already
close
by
and
heard
it
i
can
not
tell
but
she
came
in
with
a
little
tap
at
the
door
and
a
smile
a
somewhat
anxious
and
forced
smile
it
is
true
upon
her
face
what
is
the
joke
she
said
i
heard
you
laugh
and
i
thought
i
might
come
in
and
share
the
fun
somehow
we
do
have
so
much
fun
as
we
used
to
have
what
is
it
mamma
it
is
only
a
witticism
of
philip
who
has
been
in
to
see
me
said
dennistoun
i
wo
repeat
it
for
probably
i
should
lose
the
point
of
it
you
know
i
always
did
spoil
a
joke
in
repeating
it
i
have
been
speaking
to
him
she
said
after
a
little
pause
during
which
both
her
laugh
and
elinor
smile
evaporated
in
the
most
curious
way
leaving
both
of
them
very
grave
of
going
away
elinor
of
going
away
elinor
suddenly
assumed
a
startled
look
but
there
is
a
difference
between
doing
that
and
being
really
startled
which
her
mother
alas
was
quite
enlightened
enough
to
see
and
surely
once
more
there
was
that
mingled
relief
and
relaxation
in
the
lines
of
her
face
which
dennistoun
had
seen
before
yes
my
darling
she
said
it
is
june
and
everything
at
the
cottage
will
be
in
full
beauty
and
perhaps
it
would
do
you
more
good
to
come
down
there
for
a
day
or
two
when
there
is
nothing
doing
than
to
have
me
here
which
after
all
has
not
been
of
very
much
use
to
you
oh
do
say
that
mamma
use
it
has
been
of
comfort
unspeakable
but
elinor
added
hurriedly
i
see
the
force
of
all
you
say
to
remain
in
london
at
this
time
of
the
year
must
be
a
far
greater
sacrifice
than
i
have
any
right
to
ask
of
you
mamma
oh
the
furtive
hurried
unreal
words
which
were
such
pain
and
horror
to
say
with
the
consciousness
of
the
true
sentiment
lying
underneath
which
made
elinor
heart
sink
yet
were
brought
forth
with
a
sort
of
hateful
fervour
to
imitate
truth
dennistoun
saw
it
all
there
are
times
when
the
understanding
of
such
a
woman
is
almost
equal
to
those
larger
other
eyes
with
which
it
is
our
fond
hope
those
who
have
left
us
for
a
better
country
see
if
they
are
permitted
to
see
our
petty
doings
knowing
better
than
we
know
ourselves
what
excuses
what
explanations
they
are
capable
of
as
for
the
sacrifice
she
said
we
will
say
nothing
of
that
elinor
it
is
a
vain
thing
to
say
that
if
my
life
would
do
you
any
pleasure
for
you
do
want
to
take
my
life
and
probably
the
best
thing
i
can
do
for
you
is
to
go
on
as
long
as
i
can
but
in
the
meantime
there
no
question
at
all
of
sacrifice
and
if
you
can
come
down
now
and
then
for
a
day
and
sleep
in
the
fresh
air
i
will
i
will
mamma
said
elinor
hiding
her
face
on
her
shoulder
and
they
would
have
been
something
more
than
women
if
they
had
not
cried
together
as
they
held
each
other
in
that
embrace
in
which
there
was
so
much
more
than
met
either
eye
or
ear
chapter
xxii
it
was
about
the
of
june
when
dennistoun
left
london
she
had
been
in
town
for
about
five
weeks
which
looked
like
as
many
months
and
it
was
with
a
mingled
sense
of
relief
and
of
that
feeling
which
is
like
death
in
the
heart
the
sense
of
nothing
further
to
be
done
of
the
end
of
opportunity
the
conclusion
of
all
power
to
help
which
sometimes
comes
over
an
anxious
mind
without
in
any
respect
diminishing
the
anxiety
giving
it
indeed
a
depth
and
pang
beyond
any
other
feeling
that
is
known
to
the
heart
of
man
what
could
she
do
more
for
her
child
nothing
it
was
her
only
policy
to
remain
away
not
to
see
certainly
not
to
remark
anything
that
was
happening
to
wait
if
perhaps
the
moment
might
come
when
she
would
be
of
use
and
to
hope
that
perhaps
that
moment
might
never
need
to
come
that
by
some
wonderful
turn
of
affairs
all
might
yet
go
well
she
went
back
to
windyhill
with
the
promise
of
a
visit
soon
philip
himself
had
said
in
the
pleasure
of
getting
the
house
which
was
her
house
which
she
had
paid
for
and
provisioned
to
himself
for
his
own
uses
dennistoun
could
not
help
hearing
through
her
maid
something
of
the
festivities
which
were
in
prospect
after
she
was
gone
the
dinners
and
gay
receptions
at
which
she
would
have
been
she
did
not
wish
to
hear
of
them
but
these
are
things
that
will
make
themselves
known
and
dennistoun
had
to
face
the
fact
that
elinor
was
more
or
less
consenting
to
the
certainty
of
her
mother
being
which
gave
her
a
momentary
pang
but
after
all
what
did
it
matter
it
was
not
her
fault
poor
child
i
have
known
a
loving
daughter
in
whose
mind
there
was
a
sentiment
almost
of
relief
amid
her
deep
grief
when
her
tender
mother
died
could
such
a
thing
be
possible
it
was
because
after
then
however
miserable
she
might
be
there
was
no
conflict
over
her
no
rending
of
the
strained
heart
both
ways
a
woman
who
has
known
life
learns
to
understand
and
forgive
a
great
many
things
and
dennistoun
forgave
her
elinor
her
only
child
for
whose
happiness
she
had
lived
in
that
she
was
almost
glad
when
her
mother
went
away
such
things
however
do
not
make
a
lonely
little
house
in
the
country
more
cheerful
or
tend
to
make
it
easier
to
content
one
self
with
the
rector
family
and
the
good
old
retired
people
with
their
little
complaints
yet
general
peacefulness
and
incompetence
to
understand
what
tragedy
was
they
thought
on
the
whole
their
neighbour
at
the
cottage
ought
to
be
very
thankful
that
she
had
got
her
daughter
well
or
if
not
very
well
at
least
fashionably
married
with
good
connections
and
all
that
which
are
always
of
use
in
the
long
run
it
was
better
than
marrying
a
poor
curate
which
was
almost
the
only
chance
a
girl
had
on
windyhill
it
was
a
little
hard
upon
dennistoun
however
that
she
lost
not
only
elinor
but
john
who
had
been
so
good
about
coming
down
when
she
was
all
alone
at
first
of
course
during
the
season
a
young
rising
man
with
engagements
growing
upon
him
every
day
was
very
unlikely
to
have
his
saturdays
to
mondays
free
so
many
people
live
out
of
town
nowadays
or
at
least
have
a
little
house
somewhere
to
which
they
go
from
saturday
to
monday
taking
their
friends
with
them
this
was
no
doubt
the
reason
why
john
never
came
and
yet
the
poor
lady
suspected
another
reason
and
though
she
no
longer
laughed
as
she
had
done
on
that
occasion
when
the
honourable
phil
gave
her
her
dismissal
a
smile
would
come
over
her
face
sometimes
when
she
reflected
that
with
her
two
thousand
pounds
she
had
purchased
the
hostility
of
both
philip
and
john
john
tatham
was
indeed
exceedingly
angry
with
her
for
the
weakness
with
which
she
had
yielded
to
phil
compton
arguments
though
indeed
he
knew
nothing
of
phil
compton
arguments
nor
whether
they
had
been
exercised
at
all
on
the
woman
who
was
first
of
all
elinor
mother
and
ready
to
sacrifice
everything
to
her
comfort
when
he
found
that
this
foolish
step
on
her
part
had
been
followed
by
her
retirement
from
london
he
was
greatly
mystified
and
quite
unable
to
understand
he
met
elinor
some
time
after
at
one
of
those
assemblies
to
which
everybody
goes
it
was
i
think
the
soirée
at
the
royal
academy
where
amid
the
persistent
crowd
in
the
great
room
there
was
a
whirling
crowd
twisting
in
and
out
among
the
others
bound
for
heaven
knows
how
many
other
places
and
pausing
here
and
there
on
tiptoe
to
greet
an
acquaintance
at
the
tail
of
which
carried
along
by
its
impetus
was
elinor
she
was
not
looking
either
well
or
happy
but
she
was
responding
more
or
less
to
the
impulse
of
her
set
exchanging
greetings
and
banal
words
with
dozens
of
people
and
sometimes
turning
a
wistful
and
weary
gaze
towards
the
pictures
on
the
walls
as
if
she
would
gladly
escape
from
the
mob
of
her
companions
to
them
or
anywhere
it
was
no
impulse
of
taste
or
artistic
feeling
however
it
is
to
be
feared
but
solely
the
weariness
of
her
mind
john
watched
her
for
some
time
before
he
approached
her
phil
was
not
of
the
party
which
was
nothing
extraordinary
for
little
serious
as
that
assembly
is
it
was
still
of
much
too
serious
a
kind
for
phil
but
lady
mariamne
was
there
and
other
ladies
with
whom
elinor
was
in
the
habit
of
pursuing
that
gregarious
hunt
after
pleasure
which
carries
the
train
of
votaries
along
at
so
breakneck
a
pace
and
with
so
little
time
to
enjoy
the
pleasure
they
are
pursuing
when
he
saw
indications
that
the
stream
was
setting
backwards
to
the
entrance
again
to
separate
and
take
its
various
ways
to
other
entertainments
he
broke
into
the
throng
and
called
elinor
attention
to
himself
for
a
moment
she
smiled
with
genuine
pleasure
at
the
sight
of
him
but
then
changed
her
aspect
almost
imperceptibly
oh
john
she
said
with
that
smile
but
immediately
looked
towards
lady
mariamne
as
if
undecided
what
to
do
you
need
not
look
as
if
i
would
try
to
detain
you
elinor
do
you
think
i
am
afraid
of
your
detaining
me
i
thought
i
should
be
sure
to
meet
you
and
was
on
the
outlook
how
is
it
that
we
never
see
you
now
he
refused
the
natural
retort
that
she
had
never
asked
to
see
him
and
only
said
with
a
smile
i
hear
my
aunt
is
gone
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
only
came
for
her
that
is
an
unkind
speech
yes
she
has
gone
it
was
cruel
to
keep
her
in
town
for
the
best
part
of
the
year
but
she
intended
to
stay
till
july
elinor
did
she
i
think
you
are
mistaken
john
she
intended
to
watch
over
me
dear
mamma
she
thinks
too
much
of
me
but
when
she
saw
that
i
was
quite
well
you
do
look
to
me
so
extraordinarily
well
do
i
i
must
be
a
fraud
then
nobody
could
be
stronger
i
going
to
a
multitude
of
places
wherever
my
hebrew
leader
goes
i
go
said
elinor
with
a
laugh
i
have
given
myself
up
for
and
she
is
never
satisfied
with
less
than
a
dozen
ten
minutes
to
each
oh
half
an
hour
at
least
and
with
having
our
carriage
found
for
us
at
every
place
and
the
risk
of
getting
into
a
and
all
the
delays
of
coming
and
going
it
can
not
be
much
less
than
of
an
hour
this
is
the
third
i
think
three
more
will
weary
even
the
jew
you
are
with
lady
mariamne
then
elinor
yes
oh
you
need
not
make
that
face
she
is
as
good
as
the
rest
and
pretends
to
nothing
at
least
i
have
no
carriage
you
know
and
phil
took
fright
at
my
dear
old
fly
he
thought
a
hired
brougham
was
not
good
when
i
was
alone
that
was
quite
true
nevertheless
i
should
like
above
all
things
to
keep
you
here
a
little
longer
to
look
at
some
of
the
pictures
and
take
you
home
in
a
hansom
after
she
laughed
oh
so
should
i
fancy
i
have
not
seen
the
pictures
not
at
all
we
came
in
a
mob
to
the
private
view
and
then
one
day
i
was
coming
with
mamma
but
was
stopped
by
something
and
now
always
people
people
nothing
else
you
see
there
some
one
bowing
to
you
nell
be
sure
you
speak
a
word
to
the
thises
or
the
thats
while
i
do
care
for
one
of
them
but
i
fear
the
hansom
would
not
do
john
it
would
have
done
very
well
in
the
old
days
your
mother
would
not
have
been
displeased
the
old
days
are
gone
and
will
never
return
she
said
half
sad
half
smiling
shaking
her
head
so
far
as
i
can
see
nothing
ever
returns
you
have
your
day
and
if
you
do
not
make
the
best
of
that
she
stopped
shaking
her
head
again
with
a
laugh
and
there
were
various
ways
in
which
that
speech
might
be
interpreted
john
for
one
knew
a
sense
of
it
which
he
believed
had
never
entered
elinor
head
he
too
might
have
had
his
day
and
let
it
slip
so
you
are
making
the
most
of
yours
he
said
i
hear
that
you
are
very
gay
elinor
coloured
high
under
his
look
i
do
know
who
can
have
told
you
that
we
have
had
a
few
little
dinners
since
mamma
left
us
chiefly
phil
business
friends
i
would
not
have
them
while
she
was
with
us
that
is
to
say
to
be
honest
cried
elinor
while
we
were
with
her
which
of
course
was
the
real
state
of
the
case
i
myself
do
like
those
people
john
but
they
would
have
been
insupportable
to
mamma
it
was
for
her
sake
i
understand
he
said
oh
but
you
must
not
say
understand
with
that
air
of
knowing
a
great
deal
more
than
there
is
to
understand
she
said
with
heat
mamma
said
it
would
do
me
much
more
good
to
go
home
for
a
night
now
and
then
and
sleep
in
the
fresh
air
than
for
her
to
stay
and
though
i
think
she
is
a
little
insane
on
the
subject
of
my
health
still
it
was
certainly
better
than
that
she
should
stay
here
making
herself
wretched
her
rest
broken
and
all
that
you
know
we
keep
such
late
hours
i
should
not
have
thought
she
would
have
minded
that
but
what
would
you
have
thought
of
me
if
i
did
not
mind
it
for
her
there
john
do
you
see
they
are
all
going
ah
the
pictures
i
wish
i
could
have
stayed
with
you
and
gone
round
the
rooms
but
it
must
not
be
come
and
see
me
she
said
turning
round
to
him
with
a
smile
and
holding
out
her
hand
i
would
gladly
elinor
but
should
not
i
find
myself
in
the
way
of
your
fine
friends
like
he
had
not
the
heart
to
finish
the
sentence
when
he
met
her
eyes
brimming
full
of
tears
not
my
fine
friends
but
my
coarse
friends
she
said
not
friends
at
all
our
worst
enemies
i
am
sure
nell
cried
lady
mariamne
in
her
shrill
voice
you
will
come
and
see
me
john
yes
he
said
and
in
the
meantime
i
will
take
you
let
your
companions
think
as
they
please
it
proved
when
he
did
so
that
john
had
to
escort
both
ladies
to
the
carriage
which
it
was
not
very
easy
to
find
no
other
cavalier
being
at
hand
for
the
moment
and
that
lady
mariamne
invited
him
to
accompany
them
to
their
next
stage
you
know
the
durfords
of
course
you
are
going
there
what
luck
for
us
nell
jump
in
tatham
we
will
take
you
on
unfortunately
lady
durford
has
not
taken
the
trouble
to
invite
me
said
john
what
does
that
matter
jump
in
all
the
same
she
be
delighted
to
see
you
and
as
for
not
asking
you
when
you
are
with
me
and
nell
but
john
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
this
siren
song
he
went
to
curzon
street
a
little
while
after
to
call
as
he
had
been
invited
to
do
and
went
late
to
avoid
the
bustle
of
the
and
the
usual
rabble
of
that
no
longer
intimate
but
wildly
gregarious
house
and
he
was
not
without
his
reward
perhaps
a
habit
he
had
lately
formed
of
passing
by
curzon
street
in
the
late
afternoon
when
he
was
on
his
way
to
his
club
after
work
was
over
had
something
to
do
with
his
choice
of
this
hour
he
found
elinor
as
he
had
hoped
alone
she
was
sitting
so
close
to
the
window
that
her
white
dress
mingled
with
the
white
curtains
so
that
he
did
not
at
first
perceive
her
and
so
much
abstracted
in
her
own
thoughts
that
she
did
not
pay
any
attention
to
the
servant
hurried
murmur
of
his
name
at
the
door
when
she
felt
rather
than
saw
that
there
was
some
one
in
the
room
elinor
jumped
up
with
a
shock
of
alarm
that
seemed
unnecessary
in
her
own
then
seeing
who
it
was
was
so
much
and
so
suddenly
moved
that
she
shed
a
few
tears
in
some
sudden
revulsion
of
feeling
as
she
said
oh
it
is
you
john
yes
he
said
but
i
am
very
sorry
to
see
you
so
nervous
oh
it
nothing
i
was
always
nervous
which
indeed
was
the
purest
invention
for
elinor
dennistoun
had
not
known
what
nerves
meant
i
mean
i
was
always
startled
by
any
sudden
entrance
in
this
way
she
cried
and
very
gravely
asked
him
to
be
seated
with
a
curious
assumption
of
dignity
her
demeanour
altogether
was
incomprehensible
to
john
i
hope
he
said
you
were
not
displeased
with
me
elinor
for
going
off
the
other
night
i
should
have
been
too
happy
you
know
to
go
with
you
anywhere
but
lady
mariamne
is
more
than
i
can
stand
i
was
very
glad
you
did
not
come
she
said
with
a
sigh
then
smiling
faintly
but
you
were
ungrateful
for
mariamne
formed
a
most
favourable
opinion
of
you
she
said
did
you
tell
me
nell
you
had
a
cousin
so
presentable
as
that
i
am
deeply
obliged
elinor
but
it
seems
that
what
was
a
compliment
to
me
personally
involved
something
the
reverse
for
your
other
relations
it
is
one
of
their
jokes
said
elinor
with
a
voice
that
faltered
a
little
to
represent
my
relations
as
not
in
a
complimentary
way
i
am
supposed
not
to
mind
and
it
all
a
joke
or
so
they
tell
me
but
it
is
not
a
joke
i
like
she
said
with
a
flash
from
her
eyes
all
families
have
jokes
of
that
description
said
john
but
tell
me
nelly
are
you
really
going
down
to
the
cottage
to
your
mother
her
eyes
thanked
him
with
a
gleam
of
pleasure
for
the
old
familiar
name
and
then
the
light
went
out
of
them
i
do
know
she
said
abruptly
phil
was
to
come
if
he
will
not
i
think
i
will
not
either
but
i
will
say
nothing
till
i
make
sure
of
course
your
first
duty
is
to
him
said
john
but
a
day
now
or
a
day
then
interferes
with
nothing
and
the
country
would
be
good
for
you
elinor
does
your
husband
see
it
you
are
not
looking
like
yourself
not
like
myself
i
might
easily
look
better
than
myself
i
wish
i
could
i
am
not
so
bigoted
about
myself
your
friends
are
however
he
said
no
one
who
cares
for
you
wants
to
change
you
even
for
another
elinor
come
you
are
nervous
altogether
not
like
yourself
as
i
told
you
you
always
so
courageous
and
bright
this
depressed
state
is
not
one
of
your
moods
london
is
too
much
for
you
my
little
nelly
your
little
nellie
has
gone
away
somewhere
john
i
doubt
if
she
ever
come
back
yes
london
is
rather
too
much
for
me
i
think
it
such
a
racket
as
phil
says
but
then
he
used
to
it
you
know
he
was
brought
up
to
it
whereas
i
i
think
i
hate
a
racket
john
and
they
all
like
it
so
they
prefer
never
having
a
moment
to
themselves
i
daresay
one
would
end
by
being
just
the
same
it
keeps
you
from
thinking
that
is
one
very
good
thing
you
used
not
to
think
so
elinor
no
she
said
not
at
the
cottage
among
the
flowers
where
nothing
ever
happened
from
one
year
end
to
another
i
should
die
of
it
now
in
a
week
at
least
if
not
i
those
who
belong
to
me
so
on
the
whole
perhaps
london
is
the
safest
unless
phil
will
go
i
can
only
hope
you
will
be
able
to
persuade
him
said
john
rising
to
go
away
for
whatever
you
may
think
you
are
a
country
bird
and
you
want
the
fresh
air
are
you
going
john
well
perhaps
it
is
better
do
trouble
your
mind
about
me
whether
i
go
or
stay
do
you
mean
i
am
not
to
come
again
elinor
oh
why
should
i
mean
that
she
said
you
are
so
hard
upon
me
in
your
thoughts
but
she
did
not
say
that
he
was
wrong
and
john
went
out
from
the
door
saying
to
himself
that
he
would
not
go
again
he
saw
through
the
open
door
of
the
that
the
table
was
prepared
sumptuously
for
a
it
was
shining
with
silver
and
crystal
the
silver
dennistoun
old
service
which
she
had
brought
up
with
her
from
windyhill
and
which
as
a
matter
of
convenience
she
had
left
behind
with
her
daughter
would
it
ever
he
wondered
see
windyhill
again
he
went
on
to
his
club
and
there
some
one
began
to
amuse
him
with
an
account
of
lady
durford
ball
to
which
lady
mariamne
had
wished
to
take
him
are
not
those
comptons
relations
of
yours
tatham
he
said
connections
said
john
by
marriage
i
very
glad
that
all
they
are
a
queer
lot
phil
compton
you
know
the
phil
as
he
used
to
be
called
but
i
hear
turned
over
a
new
leaf
what
of
him
said
john
oh
nothing
much
only
that
he
was
flirting
desperately
all
the
evening
with
a
harris
an
american
widow
i
believe
he
came
with
her
and
his
own
wife
there
much
younger
much
prettier
a
beautiful
young
creature
looking
on
with
astonishment
you
could
see
her
eyes
growing
bigger
and
bigger
if
it
had
not
been
kind
of
amusing
to
a
it
would
be
the
most
pitiful
sight
in
the
world
i
advise
you
not
to
let
yourself
be
amused
by
such
trifles
said
john
tatham
with
a
look
of
fire
and
flame
chapter
xxiii
as
a
matter
of
fact
elinor
did
not
go
to
the
cottage
for
the
fresh
air
or
anything
else
she
made
one
hurried
run
in
the
afternoon
to
bid
her
mother
alone
which
was
not
a
visit
but
the
mere
pretence
of
a
visit
hurried
and
breathless
in
which
there
was
no
time
to
talk
of
anything
she
gave
dennistoun
an
account
of
the
usual
lists
of
visits
that
her
husband
and
she
were
to
make
in
the
autumn
which
the
mother
with
the
usual
instinct
of
mothers
thought
too
much
you
will
wear
yourself
to
death
elinor
oh
no
she
said
it
is
not
that
sort
of
thing
that
wears
one
to
death
i
shall
enjoy
it
i
suppose
as
other
people
do
i
do
know
about
enjoyment
elinor
but
i
am
sure
it
would
be
much
better
for
you
to
come
and
stay
here
quietly
with
me
oh
do
talk
to
me
of
any
paradises
mamma
we
are
in
the
world
and
we
must
make
out
our
life
as
we
can
but
you
might
let
philip
go
by
himself
and
come
and
stay
quietly
here
for
a
little
for
the
sake
of
your
health
elinor
not
for
the
world
not
for
the
world
she
cried
i
can
not
leave
phil
and
then
with
a
laugh
that
was
full
of
a
nervous
thrill
you
are
always
thinking
of
my
health
mamma
when
my
health
is
perfect
better
far
better
than
almost
anybody
the
most
of
them
have
headaches
and
that
sort
of
thing
and
they
stay
in
bed
for
a
day
or
two
constantly
but
i
never
need
anything
of
the
kind
my
darling
it
would
not
be
leaving
philip
to
take
say
a
single
week
rest
while
he
went
off
without
me
i
should
not
know
where
she
said
sullenly
then
gave
her
mother
a
guilty
look
and
laughed
again
no
no
mamma
he
would
not
like
it
a
man
does
not
like
his
wife
to
be
an
incapable
to
have
to
leave
him
and
be
nursed
up
by
her
mother
besides
it
is
to
the
country
we
are
going
you
know
to
scotland
the
finest
air
better
even
if
that
were
possible
than
windyhill
this
was
all
that
was
said
and
there
was
indeed
time
for
little
more
for
as
the
visit
was
unexpected
the
hudsons
by
bad
luck
appeared
to
take
tea
with
dennistoun
by
way
of
cheering
her
in
her
loneliness
and
were
of
course
enchanted
to
see
elinor
and
to
hear
as
hudson
said
of
all
her
doings
in
the
great
world
we
always
look
out
for
your
name
at
all
the
parties
it
gives
one
quite
an
interest
in
fashionable
life
said
the
rector
wife
nodding
her
head
and
alice
was
eager
to
hear
what
the
last
month
novelties
were
in
the
fashions
and
if
elinor
had
any
nice
new
patterns
especially
for
but
what
should
you
want
with
new
with
such
a
trousseau
as
you
had
she
added
regretfully
elinor
in
fact
was
quite
taken
from
her
mother
for
that
hour
was
it
not
perhaps
better
so
her
mother
herself
was
half
inclined
to
think
that
it
was
though
with
an
ache
in
her
heart
and
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
elinor
herself
was
thankful
that
it
so
happened
when
there
are
many
questions
on
one
side
that
must
be
asked
and
very
little
answer
possible
on
the
other
is
it
a
good
thing
when
the
foolish
outside
world
breaks
in
with
its
interest
and
prevents
this
dangerous
interchange
so
short
time
did
elinor
stay
that
she
had
kept
the
fly
waiting
which
brought
her
from
the
station
and
she
took
leave
of
her
mother
with
a
sort
of
determination
not
allowing
it
even
to
be
suggested
that
she
should
accompany
her
i
like
to
bid
you
here
she
said
at
our
own
door
where
you
have
always
come
all
my
life
to
see
me
off
even
when
i
was
only
going
to
tea
at
the
rectory
mother
dear
she
drove
off
waving
her
hand
and
dennistoun
sat
out
in
the
garden
a
long
time
till
she
saw
the
fly
go
round
the
turn
of
the
road
the
white
line
which
came
suddenly
in
sight
from
among
the
trees
and
as
suddenly
disappeared
again
round
the
side
of
the
hill
elinor
waved
her
handkerchief
from
the
window
and
her
mother
answered
and
then
she
was
gone
like
a
dream
and
the
loneliness
closed
down
more
overwhelming
than
ever
before
elinor
was
at
goodwood
her
name
in
all
the
society
papers
and
even
a
description
of
one
of
her
dresses
which
delighted
and
made
proud
the
whole
population
of
windyhill
the
paper
which
contained
it
and
which
i
believe
belonged
originally
to
miss
dale
passed
from
hand
to
hand
through
almost
the
entire
community
the
servants
getting
it
at
last
and
handing
it
round
among
the
humbler
friends
who
read
it
half
a
dozen
women
together
round
a
cottage
door
wiping
their
hands
upon
their
aprons
before
they
would
touch
the
paper
with
many
an
exclamation
and
admiring
outcry
and
then
her
name
appeared
among
the
lists
of
smart
people
who
were
going
to
the
north
now
here
now
there
in
company
with
many
other
fine
names
it
gave
the
windyhill
people
a
great
deal
of
amusement
and
if
dennistoun
did
not
quite
share
this
feeling
it
was
a
thing
for
which
her
friends
blamed
her
gently
for
only
think
what
a
fine
thing
for
elinor
to
go
everywhere
among
the
best
people
and
see
life
like
that
my
dear
friend
said
the
rector
you
know
we
can
not
hope
to
keep
our
children
always
with
us
they
must
go
out
into
the
world
while
we
old
birds
stay
at
home
and
we
must
not
we
really
must
not
grudge
them
their
good
times
as
the
americans
say
it
was
more
wonderful
than
words
could
tell
to
dennistoun
that
it
should
be
imagined
she
was
grudging
elinor
her
good
time
the
autumn
went
on
with
those
occasional
public
means
of
following
her
footsteps
which
indeed
made
even
john
tatham
who
was
not
in
an
ordinary
way
addicted
to
the
being
after
his
fashion
a
liberal
in
politics
and
far
from
aristocratical
in
his
sentiments
generally
study
that
paper
and
also
other
papers
less
worthy
and
with
of
course
many
letters
from
elinor
which
gave
more
trustworthy
accounts
of
her
proceedings
these
letters
however
were
far
less
long
far
less
detailed
than
they
had
once
been
often
written
in
a
hurry
and
short
containing
notes
of
where
she
was
going
and
of
a
continual
change
of
address
rather
than
of
anything
that
could
be
called
information
about
herself
john
i
think
went
only
once
to
the
cottage
during
the
interval
which
followed
he
went
abroad
as
usual
in
the
long
vacation
and
then
he
had
this
on
his
mind
that
he
had
obtained
a
new
light
upon
the
position
of
elinor
which
he
had
every
desire
to
keep
from
her
mother
for
dennistoun
though
she
felt
that
her
child
was
not
happy
attributed
that
to
any
reason
rather
than
a
failure
in
her
husband
love
hot
rejection
of
the
very
idea
of
leaving
phil
her
dislike
of
any
suggestion
to
that
effect
even
for
a
week
even
for
a
day
seemed
to
her
mother
a
proof
that
her
husband
at
all
events
remained
as
dear
to
her
as
ever
and
john
would
rather
have
cut
his
tongue
out
than
betray
any
chance
rumour
he
heard
and
he
heard
many
to
this
effect
he
was
of
opinion
indeed
that
in
london
and
especially
at
a
london
club
not
only
is
everything
known
that
is
to
be
known
but
much
is
known
that
has
never
existed
and
never
will
exist
if
not
blown
into
being
by
those
whose
office
it
is
to
invent
the
grief
to
come
therefore
he
thought
it
wisest
to
keep
away
lest
by
any
chance
something
might
drop
from
him
which
would
awaken
a
new
crowd
of
disquietudes
in
heart
another
incident
even
more
disquieting
than
gossip
had
indeed
occurred
to
john
it
had
happened
to
him
to
meet
lady
mariamne
at
a
great
of
a
country
house
where
all
sorts
of
people
were
invited
and
where
that
lady
claimed
his
acquaintance
as
one
of
the
least
alarming
of
the
grave
set
she
not
only
claimed
his
acquaintance
but
set
up
a
sort
of
friendship
on
the
ground
of
his
relationship
to
elinor
and
in
an
unoccupied
moment
after
dinner
one
day
poured
a
great
many
confidences
into
his
ear
is
it
such
a
pity
she
said
that
phil
and
she
do
not
get
on
oh
they
did
at
first
like
a
house
on
fire
and
if
she
had
only
minded
her
ways
they
might
still
have
been
as
thick
but
these
little
country
girls
however
they
may
disguise
it
at
first
they
all
turn
like
that
the
horridest
little
puritan
phil
does
no
more
than
a
hundred
men
than
almost
all
men
do
amuse
himself
with
anything
that
throws
itself
in
his
way
do
you
know
and
sometimes
perhaps
he
does
go
rather
far
i
think
myself
he
sometimes
goes
a
little
too
far
for
good
taste
you
know
and
that
sort
of
thing
it
was
more
amazing
to
hear
lady
mariamne
talk
of
good
taste
than
anything
that
had
ever
come
in
john
tatham
way
before
but
he
was
too
horribly
desperately
interested
to
see
the
fun
she
will
go
following
him
about
wherever
he
goes
she
ought
to
do
that
do
you
know
she
should
let
him
take
his
swing
and
the
chances
are
it
will
bring
him
back
all
right
i
told
her
so
a
dozen
times
but
she
pays
no
attention
to
me
you
a
great
pal
of
hers
why
you
give
her
a
hint
phil
not
the
sort
of
man
to
be
kept
in
order
like
that
she
ought
to
give
him
his
head
i
afraid
said
john
it
not
a
matter
in
which
i
can
interfere
well
some
of
her
friends
should
anyhow
and
teach
her
a
little
sense
you
a
cautious
man
i
see
said
lady
mariamne
you
think
it
too
delicate
to
advise
a
woman
who
thinks
herself
an
injured
wife
i
say
to
console
her
mind
you
she
said
with
a
shriek
of
a
laugh
it
may
be
supposed
that
after
this
john
was
still
more
unwilling
to
go
to
the
cottage
to
run
the
risk
of
betraying
himself
he
did
write
to
elinor
telling
her
that
he
had
heard
of
her
from
her
but
when
he
tried
to
take
lady
mariamne
advice
and
give
her
a
hint
john
felt
his
lips
sealed
how
could
he
breathe
a
word
even
of
such
a
suspicion
to
elinor
how
could
he
let
her
know
that
he
thought
such
a
thing
possible
or
presume
to
advise
her
to
take
her
condition
for
granted
it
was
impossible
he
ended
by
some
aimless
wish
that
he
might
meet
her
at
the
cottage
for
christmas
you
and
compton
he
said
whom
he
did
not
wish
to
meet
the
last
person
in
the
world
and
of
whom
there
was
no
question
that
he
should
go
to
the
cottage
at
christmas
or
any
other
time
but
what
could
john
do
or
say
to
suggest
to
her
that
he
thought
her
an
injured
wife
was
beyond
his
power
it
was
somewhere
about
christmas
just
before
in
that
dread
moment
for
the
lonely
and
those
who
are
in
sorrow
and
distress
when
all
the
rest
of
the
world
is
preparing
for
that
family
festival
or
pretending
to
prepare
that
john
tatham
was
told
one
morning
in
his
chambers
that
a
lady
wanted
to
see
him
he
was
occupied
as
it
happened
with
a
client
for
whom
he
had
stayed
in
town
longer
than
he
had
intended
to
stay
and
he
paid
little
more
attention
than
to
direct
his
clerk
to
ask
the
lady
what
her
business
was
or
if
she
could
wait
the
client
was
and
lingered
but
john
mind
was
not
free
enough
nor
his
imagination
lively
enough
to
rouse
much
curiosity
in
him
in
respect
to
the
lady
who
was
waiting
it
was
only
when
she
was
ushered
in
by
his
clerk
as
the
other
went
away
and
putting
up
her
veil
showed
the
pale
and
anxious
countenance
of
dennistoun
that
the
shock
as
of
sudden
calamity
reached
him
aunt
he
cried
springing
from
his
chair
yes
john
i
could
come
anywhere
but
here
you
will
feel
for
me
more
than
any
one
elinor
he
said
her
lips
were
dry
she
spoke
with
a
little
difficulty
but
she
nodded
her
head
and
held
out
to
him
a
telegram
which
was
in
her
hand
it
was
dated
from
a
remote
part
of
scotland
far
in
the
north
ill
come
instantly
was
all
it
said
and
i
can
not
get
away
till
night
cried
dennistoun
with
a
burst
of
subdued
sobbing
i
ca
start
till
night
is
this
all
what
was
your
last
news
nothing
but
that
they
had
gone
there
to
somebody
which
was
lent
them
i
believe
at
the
end
of
the
world
i
wrote
to
beg
her
to
come
to
me
she
is
near
a
moment
of
great
anxiety
oh
john
support
me
let
me
not
break
down
you
will
not
he
said
you
are
wanted
you
must
keep
all
your
wits
about
you
what
were
they
doing
there
at
this
time
of
the
year
they
have
been
visiting
about
they
were
invited
to
dunorban
for
christmas
but
she
persuaded
philip
so
she
said
to
take
this
little
house
i
think
he
was
to
join
the
party
while
she
i
can
not
tell
you
what
was
the
arrangement
she
has
written
very
vaguely
for
some
time
she
ought
to
have
been
with
me
i
told
her
so
but
she
has
always
said
she
could
not
leave
philip
could
not
leave
philip
the
mother
fortunately
had
no
idea
why
this
determination
was
i
went
so
far
as
to
write
to
philip
she
said
to
ask
him
if
she
might
not
come
to
me
or
at
least
begging
him
to
bring
her
to
town
or
somewhere
where
she
could
have
proper
attention
he
answered
me
very
briefly
that
he
wished
her
to
go
but
she
would
not
as
he
had
told
me
before
i
left
town
that
was
all
it
seemed
to
fret
him
he
must
have
known
that
it
was
not
a
fit
place
for
her
in
a
stranger
house
and
so
far
away
and
to
think
i
can
not
even
get
away
till
late
john
had
to
comfort
her
as
well
as
he
could
to
make
her
eat
something
to
see
that
she
had
all
the
comforts
possible
for
her
night
journey
you
were
always
like
her
brother
the
poor
lady
said
finding
at
last
relief
in
tears
and
then
he
went
with
her
to
the
train
and
found
her
a
comfortable
carriage
and
placed
her
in
it
with
all
the
solaces
his
mind
could
think
of
a
on
the
scotch
lines
is
not
such
a
ghastly
pretence
of
comfort
as
those
on
the
continent
the
solaces
john
brought
her
the
quantities
of
newspapers
the
picture
papers
and
others
rugs
and
shawls
innumerable
all
that
he
possessed
in
the
shape
of
wraps
besides
those
which
she
had
with
her
what
more
could
a
man
do
if
she
had
been
young
he
would
have
bought
her
all
that
they
meant
were
the
dumb
anxieties
of
his
own
breast
and
the
vague
longing
to
do
something
anything
that
would
be
a
help
to
her
on
her
desolate
way
you
will
send
me
a
word
aunt
as
soon
as
you
get
there
oh
at
once
john
you
will
tell
me
how
she
is
say
as
much
as
you
can
no
three
words
like
that
i
shall
not
leave
town
till
i
hear
oh
john
why
should
this
keep
you
from
your
family
i
could
telegraph
there
as
easily
as
here
he
made
a
gesture
almost
of
anger
do
you
think
i
am
likely
to
put
myself
out
of
the
way
not
to
be
ready
if
you
should
want
me
how
should
she
want
him
a
mother
summoned
to
her
daughter
at
such
a
moment
but
she
did
not
say
so
to
trouble
him
more
for
john
had
got
to
that
maddening
point
of
anxiety
when
nothing
but
doing
something
or
at
least
keeping
ready
to
do
something
flattering
yourself
that
there
must
be
something
to
do
affords
any
balm
to
the
soul
he
saw
her
away
by
that
night
train
crowded
with
people
going
home
people
noisy
with
gayety
escaping
from
their
daily
cares
to
the
family
meeting
the
father
house
all
the
associations
of
pleasure
and
warmth
and
consolation
cold
but
happy
in
their
compartments
not
wrapped
up
in
every
conceivable
solace
as
she
was
yet
no
one
perhaps
so
he
watched
for
the
last
glimpse
of
her
face
just
as
the
train
plunged
into
the
darkness
and
saw
her
smile
and
wave
her
hand
to
him
then
he
too
plunged
into
the
darkness
like
the
train
he
walked
and
walked
through
the
solitary
streets
not
knowing
where
he
was
going
unable
to
rest
had
he
ever
been
as
people
say
in
love
with
elinor
he
could
not
tell
he
had
never
betrayed
it
by
word
or
look
if
he
had
he
had
never
taken
any
step
to
draw
her
near
him
to
persuade
her
to
be
his
and
not
another
on
the
contrary
he
had
avoided
everything
that
could
lead
to
that
neither
could
he
say
she
was
as
my
sister
which
his
relationship
might
have
warranted
him
in
doing
it
was
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
she
was
not
his
love
nor
his
sister
she
was
simply
elinor
and
perhaps
she
was
dying
perhaps
the
news
he
would
receive
next
day
would
be
the
worst
that
the
heart
can
hear
he
walked
and
walked
through
those
dreary
streets
of
london
the
quiet
the
sordid
the
dismal
mile
after
mile
and
street
after
street
till
half
the
night
was
over
and
he
was
tired
out
and
might
have
a
hope
of
rest
but
for
three
whole
days
days
which
he
could
not
reckon
which
seemed
of
the
length
of
years
during
which
he
remained
closeted
in
his
chambers
the
whole
world
having
as
it
seemed
melted
away
around
him
leaving
him
alone
he
did
not
have
a
word
he
did
not
go
home
feeling
that
he
must
be
on
the
spot
whatever
happened
finally
when
he
was
almost
mad
on
the
morning
of
the
third
day
he
received
the
following
telegram
saved
as
by
a
miracle
doing
well
child
a
boy
child
a
boy
good
heavens
what
did
he
want
with
that
it
seemed
an
insult
to
him
to
tell
him
what
did
he
care
for
the
child
if
it
was
a
boy
or
not
the
wretched
undesirable
brat
of
such
parentage
born
to
perpetuate
a
name
which
was
dishonoured
altogether
the
telegram
as
so
many
telegrams
but
lighted
fresh
fires
of
anxiety
in
his
mind
saved
as
by
a
miracle
then
he
had
been
right
in
the
dreadful
fancies
that
had
gone
through
his
mind
he
had
passed
by
death
in
the
dark
and
was
it
now
sure
that
the
miracle
would
last
that
the
danger
would
have
passed
away
chapter
xxiv
it
was
not
till
nearly
three
weeks
after
this
that
john
received
another
brief
dispatch
at
home
come
and
see
us
he
had
indeed
got
a
short
letter
or
two
in
the
interval
saying
almost
nothing
a
brief
report
of
elinor
health
and
of
the
baby
against
whom
he
had
taken
an
unreasoning
disgust
and
repugnance
little
beast
he
said
to
himself
passing
over
that
part
of
the
bulletin
for
the
letters
were
scarcely
more
than
bulletins
without
a
word
about
the
circumstances
which
surrounded
her
a
shooting
lodge
in
in
the
middle
of
the
winter
what
a
place
for
a
delicate
woman
john
was
well
enough
aware
that
many
elements
of
comfort
were
possible
even
in
such
a
place
but
he
shut
his
eyes
as
was
natural
to
anything
that
went
against
his
own
point
of
view
and
now
this
telegram
from
windyhill
at
home
come
and
see
us
was
it
a
mistake
of
the
telegraph
people
of
course
they
must
make
mistakes
they
had
no
doubt
taken
the
in
dennistoun
angular
writing
for
or
was
it
possible
john
had
no
peace
in
his
mind
until
he
had
so
managed
matters
that
he
could
go
and
see
there
was
no
very
pressing
business
in
the
middle
of
january
when
people
had
hardly
yet
recovered
the
idleness
of
christmas
he
started
one
windy
afternoon
when
everything
was
grey
and
arrived
at
hurrymere
station
in
the
dim
twilight
still
ruddy
with
tints
of
sunset
he
was
in
a
very
contradictory
frame
of
mind
so
that
though
his
heart
jumped
to
see
dennistoun
awaiting
him
on
the
platform
there
mingled
in
his
satisfaction
in
seeing
her
and
hearing
what
she
had
to
tell
so
much
sooner
a
perverse
conviction
of
cold
and
discomfort
in
the
long
drive
up
in
the
pony
carriage
which
he
felt
sure
was
before
him
he
was
mistaken
however
on
this
point
for
the
first
thing
she
said
was
i
have
secured
the
fly
john
old
pearson
will
take
your
luggage
i
have
so
much
to
tell
you
there
was
an
air
of
excitement
in
her
face
but
not
that
air
of
subdued
and
silent
depression
which
comes
with
solitude
she
was
evidently
full
of
the
report
she
had
to
make
but
yet
the
first
thing
she
did
when
she
was
ensconced
in
the
fly
with
john
beside
her
was
to
cover
her
face
with
her
hands
and
subside
into
her
corner
in
a
silent
passion
of
tears
for
mercy
sake
tell
me
what
is
the
matter
what
has
happened
is
elinor
ill
he
had
almost
asked
is
elinor
dead
she
uncovered
her
face
which
had
suddenly
lighted
up
with
a
strange
gleam
of
joy
underneath
the
tears
john
elinor
is
here
she
said
here
at
home
safe
i
have
brought
her
back
and
the
child
confound
the
child
john
said
in
his
excitement
brought
her
back
what
do
you
mean
oh
john
it
is
a
long
story
i
have
a
hundred
things
to
tell
you
and
to
ask
your
advice
upon
but
the
main
thing
is
that
she
is
here
i
have
brought
her
away
from
him
she
will
go
back
no
more
she
has
left
her
husband
he
said
with
a
momentary
flicker
of
exultation
in
his
dismay
but
the
dismay
to
do
him
justice
was
the
strongest
he
looked
at
his
companion
almost
sternly
things
he
said
must
have
been
very
serious
to
justify
that
they
were
more
than
serious
they
had
become
impossible
dennistoun
said
and
she
told
him
her
story
which
was
a
long
one
she
had
arrived
to
find
elinor
alone
in
the
little
solitary
lodge
in
the
midst
of
the
wilds
not
without
attention
indeed
or
comfort
but
alone
her
husband
absent
she
had
been
very
ill
and
he
had
been
at
the
neighbouring
castle
where
a
great
party
was
assembled
and
where
the
mother
discovered
at
last
there
was
the
woman
who
had
made
elinor
life
a
burden
to
her
i
do
know
with
what
truth
i
do
know
whether
there
is
what
people
call
any
harm
in
it
it
is
possible
he
is
only
amusing
himself
i
ca
tell
but
it
has
made
elinor
miserable
this
whole
autumn
through
that
and
a
multitude
of
other
things
she
would
not
let
me
send
for
him
when
i
got
there
it
had
gone
so
far
as
that
she
said
that
the
whole
business
disgusted
him
that
he
had
lost
all
interest
in
her
that
to
hear
it
was
over
might
be
a
relief
to
him
but
nothing
more
her
heart
has
turned
altogether
against
him
john
in
every
way
there
have
been
a
hundred
things
you
think
i
am
almost
wickedly
glad
to
have
her
home
and
so
i
am
i
can
not
deny
it
to
have
her
here
even
in
her
trouble
makes
all
the
difference
to
me
but
i
am
not
so
careless
as
you
think
i
can
look
beyond
to
other
things
i
shrink
as
much
as
you
do
from
such
a
collapse
of
her
life
i
do
want
her
to
give
up
her
duty
and
now
that
there
is
the
additional
bond
of
the
child
oh
for
heaven
sake
said
john
leave
the
child
out
of
it
i
want
to
hear
nothing
of
the
child
that
is
one
chief
point
however
that
we
want
your
advice
about
john
a
man
i
suppose
does
not
understand
it
but
her
baby
is
everything
to
elinor
and
i
suppose
unless
he
can
really
be
proved
as
guilty
as
she
thinks
he
could
take
the
child
away
john
smiled
to
himself
a
little
bitterly
this
was
why
he
was
sent
for
in
such
a
hurry
not
for
the
sake
of
his
society
or
from
any
affection
for
him
but
that
he
might
tell
them
what
steps
to
take
to
secure
them
in
possession
of
the
child
he
said
nothing
for
some
time
nor
did
dennistoun
whose
disappointment
in
the
coldness
of
his
response
was
considerable
and
who
waited
in
vain
for
him
to
speak
at
length
she
said
almost
tremblingly
i
am
afraid
you
disapprove
very
much
of
the
whole
business
john
i
hope
it
has
not
been
done
rashly
he
said
the
husband
mere
absence
though
heartless
as
as
i
should
have
expected
of
the
fellow
would
yet
not
be
reason
enough
to
satisfy
any
court
any
court
you
do
think
she
means
to
bring
him
before
any
court
she
wants
only
to
be
left
alone
we
ask
nothing
from
him
not
a
penny
not
any
money
surely
surely
no
revenge
only
not
to
be
molested
there
shall
not
be
a
word
said
on
our
side
if
he
will
but
let
her
alone
john
shook
his
head
it
all
depends
upon
the
view
the
man
takes
of
it
he
said
now
this
was
very
cold
comfort
to
dennistoun
who
had
by
this
time
become
very
secure
in
her
position
feeling
herself
entirely
justified
in
all
that
she
had
done
the
man
she
said
the
man
is
not
the
sufferer
and
surely
the
woman
has
some
claim
to
be
heard
every
claim
said
john
that
is
not
what
i
was
thinking
of
it
is
this
if
the
man
has
a
leg
to
stand
upon
he
will
show
fight
if
he
has
why
that
will
make
the
whole
difference
and
probably
position
will
be
quite
safe
but
you
yourself
say
john
do
throw
back
upon
me
what
i
myself
said
i
said
that
perhaps
things
were
not
so
bad
as
she
believed
in
my
experience
i
have
found
that
folly
and
playing
with
everything
that
is
right
is
more
common
than
absolute
wrong
and
men
like
philip
compton
are
made
up
of
levity
and
disregard
of
everything
that
is
serious
in
that
case
said
john
if
you
are
right
he
will
not
let
her
go
oh
john
oh
john
do
make
me
wish
that
he
may
be
a
worse
man
than
i
think
he
could
not
force
her
to
go
back
to
him
feeling
as
she
does
nobody
can
force
a
woman
to
do
that
but
he
could
perhaps
make
her
position
untenable
he
would
perhaps
take
away
the
child
john
said
dennistoun
in
alarm
if
you
tell
her
that
she
will
fly
off
with
him
to
the
end
of
the
world
she
will
die
before
she
will
part
with
the
child
i
suppose
that
how
women
are
made
said
john
not
yet
cured
of
his
personal
offence
yes
she
said
that
how
women
are
made
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
coming
to
himself
but
you
know
aunt
a
man
may
be
pardoned
for
not
understanding
that
supreme
fascination
of
the
baby
who
cares
no
more
for
one
than
another
poor
little
animal
so
long
as
it
gets
its
food
and
is
warm
enough
we
must
await
and
see
what
the
man
will
do
is
that
the
best
is
there
nothing
we
can
do
to
defend
ourselves
in
the
meantime
to
make
any
sort
of
barricade
against
him
we
must
wait
and
see
what
he
is
going
to
do
said
john
and
they
went
over
and
over
the
question
again
and
again
as
they
climbed
the
hills
it
grew
quite
dark
as
they
drove
along
and
when
they
came
out
upon
the
open
part
of
the
road
from
which
the
cottage
was
visible
they
both
looked
out
across
the
combe
to
the
lights
in
the
windows
with
an
involuntary
movement
the
cottage
was
transformed
instead
of
the
one
lonely
lighted
window
which
had
indicated
to
john
in
former
visits
where
dennistoun
sat
alone
there
was
now
a
twinkle
from
various
points
a
glow
of
firelight
a
sensation
of
warmth
and
company
dennistoun
looked
out
upon
it
and
her
face
shone
it
was
not
a
happy
thing
that
elinor
should
have
made
shipwreck
of
her
life
should
have
left
her
husband
and
sought
refuge
in
her
mother
house
but
how
could
it
be
otherwise
than
happy
that
elinor
was
there
elinor
and
the
other
little
creature
who
was
something
more
than
elinor
herself
and
yet
another
as
for
john
he
looked
at
it
too
with
an
interest
which
stopped
all
arguments
on
the
cause
of
it
she
was
there
wrong
perhaps
impatient
too
quick
to
fly
as
she
had
been
too
quick
to
go
but
still
elinor
all
the
same
whether
she
was
right
or
wrong
the
cab
arrived
soberly
at
the
door
where
pearson
with
the
pony
carriage
coming
by
the
shorter
way
with
the
luggage
had
just
arrived
also
dennistoun
said
hurriedly
you
will
find
elinor
in
the
john
and
herself
went
hastily
through
the
house
and
up
the
stairs
she
was
going
to
the
baby
john
guessed
this
with
a
smile
of
astonishment
and
half
contempt
how
strange
it
was
there
could
not
be
a
more
sad
position
than
that
in
which
in
their
rashness
these
two
women
had
placed
themselves
and
yet
the
mother
a
woman
of
experience
who
ought
to
have
known
better
got
out
of
the
carriage
like
a
girl
without
waiting
to
be
helped
or
attended
to
and
went
like
the
wind
forgetting
everything
else
for
that
child
that
child
the
inheritor
of
phil
compton
name
and
very
likely
of
his
qualities
fated
from
his
birth
most
likely
to
bring
trouble
to
everybody
connected
with
him
and
yet
elinor
was
of
less
interest
to
her
mother
what
strange
caprices
of
nature
what
extraordinary
freaks
of
womankind
the
cottage
was
warm
and
bright
with
firelight
and
lamplight
and
in
the
great
chair
by
the
fire
was
reclining
lying
back
with
her
book
laid
on
her
lap
and
her
face
full
of
eager
attention
to
the
sounds
outside
a
pale
young
woman
surrounded
by
cushions
and
warm
wraps
and
everything
an
invalid
could
require
who
raised
to
him
eyes
more
large
and
shining
than
he
had
ever
seen
before
suffused
with
a
dew
of
pain
and
pleasure
and
eager
welcome
elinor
was
it
elinor
he
had
never
seen
her
in
any
way
like
an
invalid
before
never
knew
her
to
be
ill
or
weak
or
unable
to
walk
out
to
the
door
and
meet
him
or
anyone
she
cared
for
the
sight
of
her
ailing
weak
with
those
large
glistening
eyes
enlarged
by
feebleness
went
to
his
very
heart
fortunately
he
did
not
in
any
way
connect
this
enfeebled
state
with
the
phenomenon
which
was
best
for
all
parties
he
hurried
up
to
her
taking
her
thin
hands
into
his
own
elinor
my
poor
little
nelly
can
this
be
you
the
water
that
was
in
her
eyes
rolled
over
in
two
great
tears
a
brief
convulsion
went
over
her
face
yes
john
she
said
almost
in
a
whisper
strange
as
it
may
seem
this
is
all
that
is
left
of
me
he
sat
down
beside
her
and
for
a
moment
neither
of
them
spoke
pity
tenderness
wrath
surged
up
together
in
john
breast
pity
tender
compassion
most
strong
of
all
poor
little
thing
this
was
how
she
had
come
back
to
her
home
her
heart
broken
her
wings
broken
as
it
were
all
her
soaring
and
swiftness
and
energy
gone
he
could
scarcely
look
upon
her
for
the
pity
that
overflowed
his
heart
but
underneath
lay
wrath
not
only
against
the
man
who
had
brought
her
to
such
a
pass
but
against
herself
too
john
she
said
after
a
while
do
you
remember
saying
to
me
that
i
was
not
one
to
bear
to
put
up
with
things
to
take
the
consequences
if
i
tried
a
dangerous
experiment
and
failed
did
i
ever
say
anything
so
silly
and
so
cruel
oh
no
no
it
was
neither
silly
nor
unkind
but
quite
quite
true
i
have
thought
of
it
so
often
i
used
to
think
of
it
to
stir
up
my
pride
to
remind
myself
that
i
ought
to
try
to
be
better
than
my
nature
not
to
allow
you
to
be
a
true
prophet
but
it
was
so
and
i
could
change
it
you
can
see
you
were
right
john
for
i
have
not
been
like
a
strong
woman
able
to
endure
i
have
only
been
able
to
run
away
my
poor
little
nelly
do
pity
me
she
said
the
tears
running
over
again
i
am
too
well
off
i
am
too
well
taken
care
of
a
prodigal
should
not
be
made
so
much
of
as
i
am
do
call
yourself
a
prodigal
nelly
perhaps
things
may
not
be
as
bad
as
they
appear
at
least
it
is
but
the
first
fall
the
greatest
athlete
gets
many
before
he
can
stand
against
the
world
i
never
be
an
athlete
john
besides
i
a
woman
you
know
and
a
fall
of
any
kind
is
fatal
to
a
woman
especially
anything
of
this
kind
no
i
know
very
well
it
all
over
i
shall
never
hold
up
my
head
again
but
that
not
the
question
the
question
is
to
be
safe
and
as
free
as
can
be
mamma
takes
me
in
you
know
just
as
if
nothing
had
happened
she
is
quite
willing
to
take
the
burden
of
me
on
her
shoulders
and
of
baby
she
has
told
you
that
there
are
two
of
me
now
john
my
baby
as
well
as
myself
john
could
only
nod
an
assent
he
could
not
speak
it
a
wonderful
thing
to
come
out
of
a
wreck
with
a
treasure
in
arms
everything
going
to
pieces
behind
one
the
rafters
coming
down
the
walls
falling
in
and
yet
one
treasure
in
one
arms
oh
i
had
not
the
heart
or
the
strength
to
come
out
of
the
tumbling
house
my
mother
did
it
all
dragged
me
out
wrapped
me
up
in
love
and
kindness
carried
me
away
i
do
want
you
to
think
i
was
good
for
anything
i
should
just
have
lain
there
and
died
one
thing
i
did
not
mind
dying
at
all
i
had
quite
made
up
my
mind
that
would
not
have
been
so
disgraceful
as
running
away
there
is
nothing
that
is
disgraceful
said
john
for
heaven
sake
do
say
so
nelly
it
is
unfortunate
beyond
words
but
that
is
all
nobody
can
think
that
you
are
in
any
way
disgraced
and
if
you
are
allowed
just
to
stay
quietly
here
in
your
natural
home
i
suppose
you
desire
nothing
more
what
should
i
desire
more
john
you
do
suppose
i
should
like
to
go
and
live
in
the
world
again
and
go
into
society
and
all
that
i
have
had
about
enough
of
society
oh
i
want
nothing
but
to
be
quiet
and
unmolested
and
bring
up
my
baby
they
could
not
take
my
baby
from
me
john
i
do
not
think
so
he
said
with
a
grave
face
you
do
not
think
so
then
you
are
not
my
mother
says
dreadful
things
but
i
can
not
believe
them
they
would
never
take
an
infant
from
its
mother
to
give
it
to
to
give
it
to
a
man
who
could
do
nothing
nothing
for
it
what
could
a
man
do
with
a
young
child
a
man
always
on
the
move
who
has
no
settled
home
who
has
no
idea
what
an
infant
wants
john
i
know
law
is
inhuman
but
surely
surely
not
so
inhuman
as
that
my
dear
nelly
he
said
the
law
you
know
which
as
you
say
is
often
inhuman
recognizes
the
child
as
belonging
to
the
father
he
is
responsible
for
it
for
instance
they
never
could
come
upon
you
for
its
maintenance
or
education
or
anything
of
that
kind
until
it
had
been
proved
that
the
father
may
i
ask
said
elinor
with
uplifted
head
of
what
or
of
whom
you
are
talking
when
you
say
it
was
all
john
could
do
not
to
burst
into
a
peal
of
aggrieved
and
indignant
laughter
he
who
had
been
brought
from
town
from
his
own
comforts
such
as
they
were
to
be
consulted
about
this
brat
this
child
which
belonged
to
the
phil
and
elinor
of
all
people
in
the
world
threw
up
her
head
and
confronted
him
with
disdain
because
he
called
the
brat
it
and
not
him
or
her
whichever
it
was
john
recollected
well
enough
that
sentence
at
which
he
had
been
so
indignant
in
the
telegram
child
a
boy
but
he
affected
to
himself
not
to
know
what
it
was
for
the
indulgence
of
a
little
contumely
and
the
reward
he
had
got
was
contumely
upon
his
own
head
but
when
he
looked
at
elinor
pale
face
the
eyes
so
much
larger
than
they
ought
to
be
with
tears
welling
out
unawares
dried
up
for
a
moment
by
indignation
or
quick
hasty
temper
the
temper
which
made
her
sweeter
words
all
the
more
sweet
he
had
always
thought
then
rising
again
unawares
under
the
heavy
lids
the
lips
so
ready
to
quiver
the
pathetic
lines
about
the
mouth
when
he
looked
at
all
these
john
heart
smote
him
he
would
have
called
the
child
anything
if
there
had
been
a
sex
superior
to
him
the
baby
should
have
it
and
what
was
there
that
man
could
do
that
he
would
not
do
for
the
deliverance
of
the
mother
and
the
child
chapter
xxv
it
can
not
be
said
that
this
evening
at
the
cottage
was
an
agreeable
one
to
think
that
elinor
should
be
there
and
yet
that
there
should
be
so
little
pleasure
in
the
fact
that
the
old
party
which
had
once
been
so
happy
together
should
be
together
again
was
bewildering
and
yet
there
was
one
member
of
it
who
was
happy
with
a
shamefaced
unacknowledged
joy
to
think
that
that
which
made
her
child
miserable
should
make
her
happy
was
a
dreadful
thought
to
dennistoun
and
yet
how
could
she
help
it
elinor
was
there
and
the
baby
was
there
the
new
creature
which
had
brought
with
it
a
new
anxiety
a
rush
of
new
thoughts
and
wishes
already
everything
else
in
the
mind
of
elinor
mother
began
to
yield
to
the
desire
to
retain
these
two
the
new
mother
and
the
child
but
she
did
not
avow
this
desire
she
was
mostly
silent
taking
little
part
in
the
discussion
which
was
indeed
a
very
curious
discussion
since
elinor
debating
the
question
how
she
was
to
abandon
her
husband
and
defend
herself
against
him
never
mentioned
his
name
she
did
not
come
in
to
dinner
which
dennistoun
and
john
tatham
ate
solemnly
alone
saying
but
little
trying
to
talk
upon
indifferent
topics
with
that
very
wretched
result
which
is
usual
when
people
at
one
of
the
great
crises
of
life
have
to
make
conversation
for
each
other
while
servants
are
about
and
the
restraints
of
common
life
are
around
them
whether
it
is
the
terrible
flood
of
grief
which
has
to
be
barred
and
kept
within
bounds
so
that
the
functions
of
life
may
not
altogether
be
swept
away
or
the
sharper
but
warmer
pang
of
anxiety
that
which
cuts
like
a
serpent
tooth
yet
is
not
altogether
beyond
the
reach
of
hope
what
poor
pretences
these
are
at
interest
in
ordinary
subjects
what
miserable
gropings
after
something
that
can
furnish
a
thread
of
conversation
just
enough
to
keep
the
intercourse
of
life
going
these
two
were
not
more
successful
than
others
in
this
dismal
pursuit
dennistoun
found
a
moment
when
the
meal
was
over
before
she
left
john
poor
pretence
to
his
wine
remember
that
she
will
not
mention
his
name
nothing
must
be
said
about
him
she
said
how
can
we
discuss
him
and
what
he
is
likely
to
do
without
speaking
of
him
said
john
with
a
little
scorn
i
do
know
replied
the
poor
lady
but
you
will
find
that
she
will
not
have
his
name
mentioned
you
must
try
and
humour
her
poor
elinor
for
i
know
that
you
are
sorry
for
her
john
sorry
for
her
he
sat
over
his
glass
of
mild
claret
in
the
little
that
had
once
been
so
bright
even
now
it
was
the
cosiest
little
room
the
curtains
all
drawn
shutting
out
the
cold
wind
which
in
january
searches
out
every
crevice
the
firelight
blazing
fitfully
bringing
out
all
the
pretty
warm
decorations
the
gleam
of
silver
on
the
the
pictures
on
the
wall
the
mirror
over
the
mantelpiece
there
was
nothing
wanted
under
that
roof
to
make
it
the
very
home
of
domestic
warmth
and
comfort
and
yet
sorry
for
elinor
that
was
not
the
word
his
heart
was
sore
for
her
torn
away
from
all
her
moorings
drifting
back
a
wreck
to
the
little
youthful
home
where
all
had
been
so
tranquil
and
so
sweet
john
had
nothing
in
him
of
that
petty
sentiment
which
derives
satisfaction
from
a
calamity
it
has
foreseen
nor
had
he
even
an
old
lover
thrill
of
almost
pleasure
in
the
downfall
of
the
clay
idol
that
has
been
preferred
to
his
gold
his
pain
for
elinor
the
constriction
in
his
heart
at
thought
of
her
position
were
unmixed
with
any
baser
feeling
sorry
for
her
he
would
have
given
all
he
possessed
to
restore
her
happiness
not
in
his
way
but
in
the
way
she
had
chosen
even
last
abnegation
of
all
to
make
the
man
worthy
of
her
who
had
never
been
worthy
even
his
own
indignation
and
wrath
against
that
man
were
subservient
in
john
honest
breast
to
the
desire
of
somehow
finding
that
it
might
be
possible
to
whitewash
him
nay
to
reform
him
to
make
him
as
near
as
possible
something
which
she
could
tolerate
for
life
i
doubt
if
a
woman
notwithstanding
the
much
more
ready
power
of
sacrifice
which
women
possess
could
have
so
fully
desired
this
renewal
and
amendment
as
john
did
it
was
scarcely
too
much
to
say
that
he
hated
phil
compton
yet
he
would
have
given
the
half
of
his
substance
at
this
moment
to
make
phil
compton
a
good
man
nay
even
to
make
him
a
passable
man
to
rehabilitate
him
in
his
wife
eyes
john
stayed
a
long
time
over
his
wine
the
mild
glass
of
claret
or
perhaps
it
was
burgundy
which
was
all
that
was
offered
him
partly
to
think
the
matter
over
but
also
partly
perhaps
because
he
heard
certain
faint
gurglings
and
the
passage
of
certain
steps
active
and
full
of
energy
past
the
door
of
the
room
within
which
he
sat
going
now
to
the
now
from
which
he
divined
that
the
new
inmate
of
the
house
was
at
present
in
possession
of
the
and
of
all
attention
there
he
smiled
at
himself
for
his
hostility
to
the
child
which
of
course
was
entirely
innocent
of
all
blame
here
the
man
was
inferior
to
the
woman
in
comprehension
and
sympathy
for
he
not
only
could
not
understand
how
they
could
possibly
obtain
solace
in
their
trouble
from
this
unconscious
little
creature
but
he
was
angry
and
scornful
of
them
for
doing
so
phil
compton
brat
no
doubt
the
germ
of
a
thousand
troubles
to
come
but
besides
that
a
nothing
a
being
without
love
or
thought
or
even
consciousness
a
mere
little
animal
feeding
and
sleeping
and
yet
the
idol
and
object
of
all
the
thoughts
of
two
intelligent
women
capable
of
so
much
better
things
this
irritated
john
and
disgusted
him
in
the
midst
of
all
his
anxious
thoughts
and
his
profound
compassion
and
deliberations
how
best
to
help
and
it
was
not
till
the
passage
of
certain
feeble
sounds
outside
his
door
which
proceeded
audibly
little
bleatings
in
which
if
they
had
come
from
a
lamb
or
even
a
puppy
john
would
have
been
interested
assured
him
that
the
small
enemy
had
disappeared
that
he
finally
rose
and
proceeded
to
join
the
ladies
as
if
he
had
been
holding
a
little
private
debauch
all
by
himself
there
was
a
little
fragrance
and
air
of
the
visitor
still
in
the
room
a
little
disturbance
of
the
usual
arrangements
a
surreptitious
quite
unjustifiable
look
as
of
pleasure
in
elinor
eyes
which
were
less
expanded
and
if
as
liquid
as
ever
more
softly
bright
than
before
something
white
actually
lay
on
the
sofa
a
small
garment
which
dennistoun
whisked
away
they
were
conscious
of
john
critical
eye
upon
them
and
received
him
with
a
warmth
of
conciliatory
welcome
which
betrayed
that
consciousness
dennistoun
drew
a
chair
for
him
to
the
other
side
of
the
fire
she
took
her
own
place
in
the
middle
at
the
table
with
a
large
piece
of
white
knitting
to
which
she
gave
her
whole
attention
and
thus
the
deliberation
began
elinor
wants
to
know
john
what
you
think
we
ought
to
do
to
make
quite
sure
that
there
will
be
no
risk
about
the
baby
i
must
know
more
of
the
details
of
the
question
before
i
can
give
any
advice
said
john
john
said
elinor
raising
herself
in
her
chair
here
are
all
the
details
that
are
necessary
i
have
come
away
i
have
come
home
finding
that
life
was
impossible
there
that
is
the
whole
matter
it
may
be
probably
it
is
my
own
fault
it
is
simply
that
life
became
impossible
you
know
you
said
that
i
was
not
one
to
endure
to
put
up
with
things
i
scoffed
at
you
then
for
i
did
not
expect
to
have
anything
to
put
up
with
but
you
were
quite
right
and
life
had
become
impossible
that
is
all
there
is
any
need
to
say
to
me
yes
said
john
but
not
enough
elinor
if
it
ever
has
to
come
within
the
reach
of
the
law
but
why
should
it
come
within
the
reach
of
the
law
you
john
you
are
a
lawyer
you
know
the
rights
of
everything
i
thought
you
might
have
arranged
it
all
could
you
try
to
make
a
kind
of
a
bargain
what
bargain
oh
am
i
a
lawyer
do
i
know
but
you
john
who
have
it
all
at
your
fingers
ends
who
know
what
can
be
done
and
what
ca
be
done
and
the
rights
that
one
has
and
that
another
has
dear
john
if
you
were
to
try
do
you
think
that
you
could
settle
it
all
simply
as
between
people
who
do
want
any
exposure
any
struggle
but
only
to
be
quiet
and
to
be
let
alone
elinor
i
do
know
what
i
could
do
with
so
little
information
as
i
have
to
know
that
you
found
your
life
impossible
is
enough
for
me
but
you
know
most
people
are
right
in
their
own
eyes
if
we
have
some
one
opposed
to
us
who
thinks
for
instance
that
the
fault
was
yours
well
she
cried
eagerly
i
am
willing
to
accept
that
say
that
the
fault
was
mine
you
could
confirm
it
that
it
was
likely
to
be
mine
you
could
tell
them
what
an
impatient
person
i
was
and
that
you
said
i
was
not
one
to
try
an
experiment
for
i
never
never
could
put
up
with
anything
john
you
could
be
a
witness
as
well
as
an
advocate
you
could
prove
that
you
always
expected
and
that
i
am
quite
quite
willing
to
allow
that
it
was
i
elinor
if
i
could
only
make
you
understand
what
i
mean
i
am
told
that
i
am
not
to
mention
any
names
no
no
names
no
names
what
is
the
good
we
both
know
very
well
what
we
mean
but
i
do
know
very
well
what
you
mean
do
you
see
that
if
it
is
your
fault
if
the
other
party
is
innocent
there
can
be
no
reason
in
the
world
why
he
should
consent
to
renounce
his
rights
it
is
not
a
mere
matter
of
feeling
there
is
right
in
it
one
way
or
another
either
on
your
side
or
else
on
the
other
side
and
if
it
is
on
the
other
side
why
should
a
man
give
up
what
belongs
to
him
why
should
he
renounce
what
is
most
dear
to
him
oh
john
john
john
she
made
this
appeal
and
outcry
clasping
her
hands
together
with
a
mixture
of
supplication
and
impatience
then
turning
to
her
mother
oh
tell
him
she
cried
tell
him
always
clasping
those
impatient
yet
beseeching
hands
you
see
john
said
dennistoun
elinor
knows
that
the
right
is
on
her
side
but
she
will
consent
to
say
nothing
about
it
to
any
one
to
give
herself
out
as
the
offender
rather
that
is
to
say
as
an
person
that
can
not
put
up
with
anything
as
you
seem
to
have
said
john
laughed
with
vexation
yet
a
kind
of
amusement
i
never
said
it
nor
thought
it
still
if
it
pleases
her
to
think
so
the
wiser
thing
if
this
separation
is
final
if
it
is
final
elinor
cried
she
raised
herself
up
again
in
her
chair
and
contemplated
the
unfortunate
john
with
a
sort
of
tragic
superiority
do
you
think
that
of
me
she
said
that
i
would
take
such
a
step
as
this
and
that
it
should
not
be
final
is
dying
final
could
one
do
such
a
thing
as
this
and
change
such
things
have
been
done
said
john
elinor
forgive
me
i
must
say
it
it
is
all
your
life
that
is
in
the
balance
and
another
life
there
is
this
infant
to
be
struggled
over
perhaps
rent
in
two
by
those
who
should
have
united
to
take
care
of
him
and
it
a
boy
i
hear
his
name
and
his
to
think
of
a
child
without
a
father
perhaps
the
heir
of
a
family
to
which
he
will
not
belong
elinor
tell
her
aunt
you
understand
is
it
my
wish
to
hand
her
back
to
to
no
i
speak
no
names
but
you
know
i
disliked
it
always
opposed
it
always
it
is
not
out
of
any
favour
to
to
the
other
side
but
she
ought
to
take
all
these
things
into
account
her
own
position
and
the
position
in
the
future
of
the
child
elinor
had
crushed
her
fan
with
her
hands
and
dennistoun
let
the
knitting
with
which
she
had
gone
on
in
spite
of
all
fall
at
last
in
her
lap
there
was
a
little
pause
john
tatham
voice
itself
had
began
to
falter
or
rather
swelled
in
sound
as
when
a
stream
swells
in
flood
i
do
not
go
into
the
question
about
women
and
what
they
ought
to
put
up
with
said
john
resuming
there
many
things
that
law
can
do
nothing
for
and
nature
in
many
ways
makes
it
harder
for
women
i
acknowledge
we
can
not
change
that
think
what
her
position
will
be
neither
a
wife
nor
with
the
freedom
of
a
widow
and
the
boy
bearing
the
name
of
one
he
must
almost
be
taught
to
think
badly
of
for
one
of
them
must
be
in
the
wrong
he
shall
never
never
hear
that
name
he
shall
know
nothing
he
shall
be
free
of
every
bond
his
mind
shall
never
be
cramped
or
twisted
or
troubled
by
any
man
if
i
live
this
elinor
said
lifting
her
pale
face
from
her
hands
with
eyes
that
flashed
and
shone
with
a
blaze
of
excitement
and
weakness
there
already
said
john
is
a
tremendous
condition
if
you
live
who
can
make
sure
that
they
will
live
we
must
all
die
some
sooner
some
later
and
you
wearing
yourself
out
with
excitement
that
never
were
strong
you
exposing
your
heart
the
weakest
organ
john
said
dennistoun
grasping
him
by
the
arm
you
are
talking
nonsense
you
do
know
what
you
are
saying
my
darling
she
was
never
weak
nor
had
a
feeble
heart
nor
anything
she
will
live
to
bring
up
children
her
baby
children
upon
her
knees
and
what
would
it
matter
said
elinor
looking
at
him
with
clear
eyes
from
which
the
tears
had
disappeared
in
the
shock
of
this
suggestion
suppose
i
have
no
more
strength
than
that
suppose
i
were
to
die
you
shall
be
his
guardian
john
bring
him
up
a
good
man
and
his
heavenly
father
will
take
care
of
him
i
am
not
afraid
a
man
had
better
not
deal
with
such
subjects
between
two
women
what
with
dennistoun
indignant
protest
and
elinor
lofty
submission
john
was
at
his
wits
end
i
did
not
mean
to
carry
things
to
such
a
bitter
end
as
that
he
said
you
want
to
force
me
into
a
corner
and
make
me
say
things
i
never
meant
the
question
is
serious
enough
without
that
there
was
again
a
little
pause
and
then
elinor
with
one
of
those
changes
which
are
so
perplexing
to
people
suddenly
turned
to
him
holding
out
both
her
hands
john
we
leave
that
in
god
hands
whatever
is
to
happen
to
me
but
in
the
meantime
while
i
am
living
and
perhaps
my
life
depends
upon
being
quiet
and
having
a
little
peace
and
rest
it
is
not
that
i
care
very
much
for
my
life
said
elinor
with
that
clear
look
like
the
sky
after
rain
i
am
shipwrecked
john
as
you
say
but
my
mother
does
and
it
of
some
consequence
to
baby
and
if
it
depends
upon
whether
i
am
left
alone
you
are
too
good
a
friend
to
leave
me
in
the
lurch
and
you
said
one
night
whatever
happened
i
was
to
send
for
you
john
sprang
up
from
his
seat
dropping
the
hands
which
he
had
taken
into
his
own
she
was
like
queen
katherine
about
to
weep
and
her
breast
strained
with
the
sobbing
effort
to
keep
it
down
for
god
sake
he
cried
do
play
upon
our
hearts
like
this
i
will
do
anything
everything
whatever
you
choose
to
tell
me
aunt
do
let
her
cry
do
let
her
go
on
like
that
why
good
heavens
he
cried
bursting
himself
into
a
kind
of
big
sob
wo
it
be
bad
for
that
little
brat
of
a
baby
or
something
if
she
keeps
going
on
in
this
way
thus
john
tatham
surrendered
at
discretion
what
could
he
do
more
a
man
can
not
be
played
upon
like
an
instrument
without
giving
out
sounds
of
which
he
will
perhaps
be
ashamed
and
this
woman
appealing
to
him
this
girl
looking
like
the
little
elinor
he
remembered
younger
and
softer
in
her
weakness
and
trouble
than
she
had
been
in
her
beauty
and
pride
was
the
creature
after
all
though
she
would
never
know
it
whom
he
loved
best
in
the
world
he
had
wanted
to
save
her
in
the
one
worldly
way
of
saving
her
from
open
shipwreck
for
her
own
sake
against
every
prejudice
and
prepossession
of
his
mind
but
if
she
would
not
have
that
why
it
was
his
business
to
save
her
as
she
wished
to
do
for
her
whatever
she
wanted
to
act
as
her
agent
her
champion
whatever
she
pleased
he
was
sent
away
presently
and
accepted
his
dismissal
with
thankfulness
to
smoke
his
cigar
this
is
one
amusing
thing
in
a
feminine
household
a
man
is
supposed
to
want
all
manner
of
little
indulgences
and
not
to
be
able
to
do
without
them
he
is
carefully
left
alone
over
his
wine
the
aforesaid
glass
of
claret
and
ways
and
means
are
provided
for
him
to
smoke
his
cigar
whether
he
wishes
it
or
not
he
had
often
laughed
at
these
regulations
of
his
careful
relatives
but
he
was
rather
glad
of
them
i
am
going
to
get
elinor
to
bed
said
dennistoun
it
has
perhaps
been
a
little
too
much
for
her
but
when
you
have
finished
your
cigar
john
if
you
will
come
back
to
the
for
a
few
minutes
you
will
find
me
here
john
did
not
smoke
any
cigar
it
is
all
very
well
to
be
soothed
and
consoled
by
tobacco
in
your
own
room
at
your
own
ease
but
when
you
are
put
into
a
lady
where
everything
is
nice
and
where
the
curtains
will
probably
smell
of
smoke
next
morning
and
when
your
mind
is
exercised
beyond
even
the
power
of
the
body
to
keep
still
that
is
not
a
time
to
enjoy
such
calm
and
composing
delights
but
he
walked
about
the
room
in
which
he
was
shut
up
like
a
wild
beast
in
his
cage
sometimes
with
long
strides
from
wall
to
wall
sometimes
going
round
with
that
abstract
trick
of
his
staring
at
the
pictures
as
if
he
did
not
know
every
picture
in
the
place
by
heart
he
forgot
that
he
was
to
go
back
to
the
again
after
elinor
had
been
taken
to
bed
and
it
was
only
after
having
waited
for
him
a
long
time
that
dennistoun
came
almost
timidly
knocking
at
her
own
door
afraid
to
disturb
her
visitor
in
the
evening
rites
which
she
believed
in
so
devoutly
she
did
go
in
however
and
they
stood
together
over
the
fire
for
a
few
minutes
he
staring
down
upon
the
glow
at
his
feet
she
contemplating
fitfully
unconsciously
her
own
pale
face
and
his
in
the
dim
mirror
on
the
mantelpiece
they
talked
in
low
tones
about
elinor
and
her
health
and
her
determination
which
nothing
would
change
of
course
i
will
do
it
said
john
anything
whatever
she
may
require
of
me
there
are
no
two
words
about
that
there
is
only
one
thing
i
will
not
compromise
her
by
taking
any
initiative
let
us
wait
and
see
what
they
are
going
to
do
but
john
might
it
not
be
better
to
disarm
him
by
making
overtures
anything
i
would
do
anything
if
he
would
but
let
her
remain
unmolested
and
the
baby
do
you
mean
money
he
said
dennistoun
gave
him
an
abashed
look
deprecatory
and
wistful
but
did
not
make
any
reply
phil
compton
is
a
cad
and
a
brute
and
a
scamp
of
the
first
water
said
john
glad
of
some
way
to
get
rid
of
his
excitement
but
i
do
not
think
that
even
he
would
sell
his
wife
and
his
child
for
money
i
would
do
him
so
much
discredit
as
that
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
john
dennistoun
said
chapter
xxvi
john
left
the
cottage
next
morning
with
the
full
conduct
of
the
affairs
of
the
family
placed
in
his
hands
the
ladies
were
both
a
little
doubtful
if
his
plan
was
the
best
they
were
still
frightened
for
what
might
happen
and
kept
up
a
watch
as
john
perceived
fearing
every
step
that
approached
trembling
at
every
shadow
they
remembered
many
stories
such
as
rush
to
the
minds
of
persons
in
trouble
of
similar
cases
of
the
machinations
of
the
bad
father
whose
only
object
was
to
overcome
and
break
down
his
wife
and
who
stole
his
child
away
to
let
it
languish
and
die
there
are
some
circumstances
in
which
people
forget
all
the
shades
of
character
and
take
it
for
granted
that
a
man
who
can
go
wrong
in
one
matter
will
act
like
a
very
demon
in
all
this
was
doubly
strong
in
dennistoun
a
woman
full
of
toleration
and
experience
but
the
issues
were
so
momentous
to
her
and
the
possible
results
so
terrible
that
she
lost
her
accustomed
good
sense
it
was
more
natural
perhaps
that
elinor
who
was
weak
in
health
and
still
full
of
the
arbitrariness
of
youth
should
entertain
this
fear
without
considering
that
phil
was
the
very
last
man
in
the
world
to
burden
himself
with
an
infant
of
the
most
helpless
age
which
seemed
to
john
an
almost
quite
unreasonable
one
almost
for
of
course
he
too
was
compelled
to
allow
when
driven
into
a
corner
that
there
was
nothing
that
an
exasperated
man
might
not
do
elinor
had
come
down
early
to
see
her
cousin
before
he
left
the
house
bringing
with
her
in
her
arms
the
little
bundle
of
muslin
and
flannel
upon
the
safety
of
which
her
very
life
seemed
to
depend
john
looked
at
it
and
at
the
small
pink
face
and
unconscious
flickering
hands
that
formed
the
small
centre
to
all
those
wrappings
with
a
curious
mixture
of
pity
and
repugnance
it
was
like
any
other
blind
kitten
or
puppy
he
thought
but
not
so
amusing
no
it
was
not
blind
to
be
sure
at
one
moment
without
any
warning
it
suddenly
opened
a
pair
of
eyes
which
by
a
lively
exercise
of
fancy
might
be
supposed
like
elinor
and
seemed
to
look
him
in
the
face
which
startled
him
very
much
with
a
curious
notification
of
the
fact
that
the
thing
was
not
a
kitten
or
a
puppy
but
then
a
little
quiver
came
over
the
small
countenance
and
the
attendant
said
it
was
the
wind
perhaps
the
opening
of
the
eyes
was
the
wind
too
or
some
other
automatic
effect
he
would
not
hold
out
his
finger
to
be
clasped
tight
by
the
little
flickering
fist
as
elinor
would
have
had
him
he
would
none
of
those
follies
he
turned
away
from
it
not
to
allow
himself
to
be
moved
by
the
effect
quite
a
meretricious
one
of
the
baby
in
the
young
mother
arms
that
was
all
poetry
sentiment
the
trick
of
the
painter
who
had
found
the
combination
beautiful
such
ideas
belonged
indeed
to
the
and
he
had
never
felt
any
profane
resistance
of
mind
against
the
san
sisto
picture
or
any
of
its
kind
but
phil
compton
brat
was
a
very
different
thing
what
did
it
matter
what
became
of
it
if
it
were
not
for
elinor
perverse
feeling
on
the
subject
and
that
perfectly
imbecile
prostration
of
her
mother
a
sensible
woman
who
ought
to
have
known
better
before
the
little
creature
he
would
himself
have
been
rather
grateful
to
phil
compton
for
taking
it
away
but
when
he
saw
the
look
of
terror
upon
elinor
face
when
an
unexpected
step
came
to
the
door
when
he
saw
her
turn
and
fly
wrapping
the
child
in
her
arms
on
her
very
heart
as
it
seemed
bending
over
it
covering
it
so
that
it
disappeared
altogether
in
her
embrace
john
heart
was
a
little
touched
it
was
only
a
hawking
tramp
with
pins
and
needles
who
came
by
mistake
to
the
hall
door
but
her
panic
and
anguish
of
alarm
were
a
spectacle
which
he
could
not
get
out
of
his
eyes
you
see
she
never
feels
safe
for
a
moment
it
will
be
hard
to
persuade
her
that
that
man
though
i
seen
him
about
the
roads
for
years
is
not
an
emissary
or
a
spy
to
find
out
if
she
is
here
i
am
sure
it
is
quite
an
unnecessary
panic
said
john
in
the
first
place
phil
compton
the
last
man
to
burden
himself
with
a
child
in
the
second
he
not
a
brute
nor
a
monster
you
called
him
a
brute
last
night
john
i
did
not
mean
in
that
way
i
do
mean
to
stand
by
any
rash
word
that
may
be
forced
from
me
in
a
moment
of
irritation
aunt
get
her
to
give
over
that
she
torture
herself
to
death
for
nothing
he
not
try
to
take
the
child
away
not
just
now
at
all
events
not
while
it
is
a
mere
bring
her
to
her
senses
on
that
point
you
surely
can
do
that
if
i
was
quite
sure
of
being
in
my
own
dennistoun
said
with
a
forlorn
smile
i
am
as
much
frightened
as
she
is
john
and
remember
if
there
is
anything
to
be
done
anything
there
is
nothing
but
a
little
common
sense
wanted
said
john
but
as
he
drove
away
from
the
door
and
saw
the
hawker
with
the
needles
still
about
the
ladies
had
so
infected
him
that
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
restrain
an
inclination
to
take
the
vagrant
by
the
collar
and
throw
him
down
the
combe
who
that
fellow
hanging
about
he
said
to
pearson
who
was
driving
him
and
what
does
he
want
here
bless
you
sir
that
joe
pearson
said
he
after
no
harm
honest
enough
as
long
as
there
ai
nothing
much
in
his
way
and
waiting
for
the
pieces
as
cook
gives
him
once
a
week
when
he
comes
his
rounds
there
no
harm
in
poor
joe
i
suppose
not
since
you
say
so
said
john
but
you
know
the
ladies
are
rather
nervous
pearson
you
must
keep
a
that
no
person
hangs
about
the
house
bless
us
john
said
pearson
what
are
they
nervous
about
the
baby
but
nobody
wants
to
steal
a
baby
bless
your
soul
i
quite
agree
with
you
said
john
much
relieved
though
he
considered
pearson
an
old
fool
in
a
general
way
to
have
his
own
opinion
confirmed
but
all
the
same
i
wish
you
would
be
doubly
particular
not
to
admit
anybody
you
do
know
and
if
any
man
should
appear
to
bother
them
send
for
me
on
the
moment
do
you
hear
what
do
you
call
any
man
sir
said
pearson
smartly
he
had
ideas
of
his
own
though
he
might
be
a
fool
i
mean
what
i
say
said
john
more
sharply
still
any
one
that
molests
or
alarms
them
send
me
off
a
telegram
at
once
wanted
that
will
be
quite
enough
but
do
go
with
it
to
the
office
yourself
send
somebody
there
always
your
boy
about
the
place
and
keep
about
like
a
dragon
yourself
i
do
my
best
sir
said
pearson
though
i
do
know
what
a
dragon
is
except
it
the
one
in
the
bible
and
that
not
a
thing
anybody
would
want
about
the
place
it
was
a
comfort
to
john
after
all
his
troubles
to
be
able
to
laugh
which
he
did
with
a
heartiness
which
surprised
pearson
who
was
quite
unaware
that
he
had
made
any
joke
these
fears
however
which
were
imposed
upon
him
by
the
contagion
of
the
terrors
of
the
others
soon
passed
from
john
mind
he
was
convinced
that
phil
compton
would
take
no
such
step
and
that
however
much
he
might
wish
his
wife
to
return
the
possession
of
the
baby
was
not
a
thing
which
he
would
struggle
over
it
can
not
be
denied
however
that
he
was
anxious
and
eagerly
inspected
his
letters
in
the
morning
and
looked
out
for
telegrams
during
the
day
fortunately
however
no
evil
tidings
came
dennistoun
reported
unbroken
peace
in
the
cottage
and
increasing
strength
on
the
part
of
elinor
and
in
a
parenthesis
with
a
sort
of
apology
of
the
baby
nobody
had
come
near
them
to
trouble
them
elinor
had
received
no
letters
the
tie
between
her
and
her
husband
seemed
to
be
cut
as
with
a
knife
we
can
not
of
course
she
said
expect
this
tranquillity
to
last
and
it
came
to
be
a
very
curious
thought
with
john
as
week
after
week
passed
whether
it
was
to
last
whether
phil
compton
who
had
never
been
supposed
wanting
in
courage
intended
to
let
his
wife
and
child
drop
off
from
him
as
if
they
had
never
been
this
seemed
a
thing
impossible
to
conceive
but
john
said
to
himself
with
much
internal
contempt
that
he
knew
nothing
of
the
workings
of
the
mind
of
such
a
man
and
that
it
might
for
aught
he
knew
be
a
common
incident
in
life
with
the
phil
comptons
thus
to
shake
off
their
belongings
when
they
got
tired
of
them
the
fool
the
booby
to
get
tired
of
elinor
that
rumour
which
flies
about
the
world
so
strangely
and
communicates
information
about
everybody
to
the
vacant
ear
to
be
retailed
to
those
whom
it
may
concern
provided
him
as
the
days
went
by
with
many
particulars
which
he
had
not
been
able
to
obtain
from
elinor
phil
it
appeared
had
gone
to
glenorban
the
great
house
to
which
he
had
been
invited
alone
with
an
excuse
for
his
wife
whose
state
of
health
was
not
appropriate
to
a
large
party
and
had
stayed
there
spending
christmas
with
a
brilliant
houseful
of
guests
among
whom
was
the
american
lady
who
had
captivated
him
phil
had
paid
one
visit
to
the
lodge
to
see
elinor
by
her
summons
at
the
crisis
of
her
illness
but
had
not
hesitated
to
go
away
again
when
informed
that
the
crisis
was
over
dennistoun
never
told
what
had
passed
between
them
on
that
occasion
but
the
gossips
of
the
club
were
credibly
informed
that
she
had
bullied
and
stormed
at
phil
after
the
fashion
of
till
she
had
driven
him
away
upon
which
he
had
returned
to
his
party
and
flirted
with
harris
more
than
ever
john
discovered
also
that
the
party
having
dispersed
some
time
ago
phil
had
gone
abroad
whether
in
ignorance
of
his
flight
or
not
he
could
not
discover
but
it
was
almost
impossible
to
believe
that
he
would
have
gone
to
monte
carlo
without
finding
out
something
about
elinor
how
and
where
she
was
but
whether
this
was
the
cause
of
his
utter
silence
or
whether
it
was
the
habit
of
men
of
his
class
to
treat
such
tremendous
incidents
in
domestic
life
with
levity
john
tatham
could
not
make
out
he
was
congratulating
himself
however
upon
keeping
perfectly
quiet
and
leaving
the
conduct
of
the
matter
to
the
other
party
when
the
silence
was
disturbed
in
what
seemed
to
him
the
most
curious
way
one
afternoon
when
he
returned
from
the
court
he
was
aware
when
he
entered
the
outer
office
in
which
his
clerk
abode
of
what
he
described
afterwards
as
a
smell
fit
to
knock
you
down
it
would
have
been
described
more
appropriately
in
a
french
novel
as
the
special
perfume
subtle
and
exquisite
by
which
a
beautiful
woman
may
be
recognised
wherever
she
goes
it
was
indeed
neither
more
nor
less
than
the
particular
scent
used
by
lady
mariamne
who
came
forward
with
a
sweep
and
rustle
of
her
draperies
and
the
most
ingratiating
of
her
smiles
it
appears
to
be
fated
that
i
am
to
wait
for
you
she
said
how
do
you
do
tatham
take
me
out
of
this
horrible
dirty
place
i
am
quite
sure
you
have
some
nice
rooms
in
there
she
pointed
as
she
spoke
to
the
inner
door
and
moved
towards
it
with
the
air
of
a
person
who
knew
where
she
was
going
and
was
fully
purposed
to
be
admitted
john
said
afterwards
that
to
think
of
this
woman
abominable
scent
being
left
in
his
room
in
which
he
lived
though
he
also
received
his
clients
in
it
was
almost
more
than
he
could
bear
but
in
the
meantime
he
could
do
nothing
but
open
the
door
to
her
and
offer
her
his
most
comfortable
chair
she
seated
herself
with
all
those
little
tricks
of
movement
which
are
also
part
of
the
of
the
pretty
woman
lady
prettiness
was
not
of
a
kind
which
had
the
slightest
effect
upon
john
but
still
it
was
a
kind
which
received
credit
in
society
being
the
product
of
a
great
deal
of
pains
and
care
and
exquisite
arrangement
and
combination
she
threw
her
fur
cloak
back
a
little
arranged
the
strings
of
her
bonnet
under
her
chin
which
threw
up
the
daintiness
and
rosiness
of
a
complexion
about
which
there
were
many
questions
among
her
closest
friends
she
shook
up
with
what
had
often
been
commented
upon
as
the
prettiest
gesture
the
bracelets
from
her
wrists
she
arranged
the
veil
which
just
came
over
the
tip
of
her
delicate
nose
she
put
out
her
foot
as
if
searching
for
a
footstool
which
john
made
haste
to
supply
though
he
remained
unaffected
otherwise
by
all
these
pretty
preliminaries
sit
down
tatham
then
said
lady
mariamne
it
makes
me
wretchedly
uncomfortable
as
if
you
were
some
dreadful
man
waiting
to
be
paid
or
something
to
see
you
standing
there
though
john
first
impulse
was
that
of
wrath
to
be
thus
requested
to
sit
down
in
his
own
chambers
the
position
was
amusing
as
well
as
disagreeable
and
he
laughed
and
drew
a
chair
towards
his
which
was
as
crowded
and
untidy
as
the
of
a
busy
man
usually
is
and
placed
himself
in
an
attitude
of
attention
though
without
asking
any
question
well
said
lady
mariamne
slowly
drawing
off
her
glove
you
know
of
course
why
i
have
come
tatham
to
talk
over
with
you
as
a
man
who
knows
the
world
this
deplorable
business
you
see
it
has
come
about
exactly
as
i
said
i
knew
what
would
happen
and
though
i
am
not
one
of
those
people
who
always
insist
upon
being
proved
right
you
remember
what
i
said
i
remember
that
you
said
something
to
which
perhaps
had
i
thought
i
should
have
been
called
upon
to
give
evidence
as
to
its
correctness
i
should
have
paid
more
attention
lady
mariamne
how
rude
you
are
she
said
with
her
whole
interest
concentrated
upon
the
slow
removal
of
her
glove
then
she
smoothed
a
little
softly
the
pretty
hand
which
was
thus
uncovered
and
said
how
red
one
hands
get
in
this
weather
and
then
laughed
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
tatham
she
said
suddenly
raising
her
eyes
to
his
that
considering
what
a
very
particular
person
we
were
discussing
you
ca
remember
what
i
said
john
was
obliged
to
confess
that
he
remembered
more
or
less
the
gist
of
her
discourse
and
lady
mariamne
nodded
her
head
many
times
in
acceptance
of
his
confession
well
she
said
you
see
what
it
has
come
to
an
open
scandal
a
separation
and
everything
broken
up
for
one
thing
i
knew
if
she
did
not
give
him
his
head
a
little
that
what
would
happen
i
do
believe
he
cares
a
brass
farthing
for
that
other
woman
she
makes
fun
of
everybody
and
that
amused
him
and
it
amused
him
to
put
nell
in
a
state
that
as
much
as
anything
why
could
she
see
that
and
learn
to
son
like
other
people
she
was
free
to
say
go
your
way
and
i
go
mine
the
most
of
us
do
that
sooner
or
later
but
to
make
a
vulgar
open
rupture
and
go
off
like
this
i
fail
to
see
the
vulgarity
in
it
said
john
oh
of
course
everything
she
does
is
perfect
to
you
but
just
think
if
it
had
been
your
own
case
followed
about
and
bullied
by
a
jealous
woman
in
a
state
of
health
that
of
itself
disgusts
a
man
lady
mariamne
you
must
pardon
me
if
i
refuse
to
listen
to
anything
more
of
this
kind
said
john
starting
to
his
feet
oh
i
warn
you
you
be
compelled
to
listen
to
a
great
deal
more
if
you
her
agent
as
i
hear
phil
will
find
means
of
compelling
you
to
hear
if
you
do
like
to
take
your
information
from
me
i
should
like
to
know
how
phil
compton
will
succeed
in
compelling
me
to
anything
i
do
choose
to
do
you
think
perhaps
because
there
no
duelling
in
this
country
he
ca
do
anything
but
there
is
all
the
same
he
would
shame
you
into
it
he
could
say
you
were
sheltering
yourself
i
am
not
a
man
to
fight
duels
said
john
very
angry
but
smiling
in
any
circumstances
even
were
such
a
thing
not
utterly
ridiculous
but
even
a
fighting
man
might
feel
that
to
put
himself
on
a
level
with
the
he
stopped
himself
as
he
said
it
how
mean
it
was
to
a
woman
descending
to
their
own
methods
but
lady
mariamne
was
too
quick
for
him
oh
she
said
so
you
heard
of
that
a
nickname
that
no
gentleman
then
she
too
paused
and
looked
at
him
with
a
momentary
flush
he
was
going
to
apologize
abjectly
when
with
a
slight
laugh
she
turned
the
subject
aside
pretty
fools
we
are
both
of
us
to
talk
such
nonsense
i
did
come
here
carrying
phil
on
my
shoulders
to
spring
at
your
throat
if
you
expressed
your
opinion
look
here
tell
me
do
let
us
go
beating
about
the
bush
tatham
i
suppose
you
have
seen
nell
i
know
my
cousin
mind
at
least
he
said
well
then
just
tell
me
as
between
friends
there
no
need
we
should
quarrel
because
they
have
done
so
tell
me
this
is
she
going
to
get
up
a
divorce
case
a
divorce
because
said
lady
mariamne
she
find
it
precious
difficult
to
prove
anything
i
know
she
will
she
may
prove
the
flirting
and
so
forth
but
what
that
you
can
tell
her
from
me
it
wants
somebody
far
better
up
to
things
than
she
is
to
prove
anything
i
warn
her
as
a
friend
she
not
get
much
good
by
that
move
i
am
not
aware
said
john
whether
compton
has
made
up
her
mind
about
the
further
steps
then
just
you
advise
her
not
cried
lady
mariamne
it
does
matter
to
me
i
shall
be
none
the
worse
whatever
she
does
but
if
you
are
her
true
friend
you
will
advise
her
not
she
might
tell
what
she
thinks
but
that
no
proof
tatham
i
know
you
have
great
influence
with
nell
not
in
a
matter
like
this
said
john
with
great
gravity
of
course
she
alone
can
be
the
judge
what
nonsense
you
talk
you
men
of
course
she
is
not
the
least
the
judge
and
of
course
she
will
be
guided
by
you
you
may
be
sure
she
shall
have
the
best
advice
that
i
can
give
john
said
with
a
bow
you
want
me
to
go
i
see
said
lady
mariamne
you
are
dreadfully
rude
standing
up
all
the
time
to
show
me
i
had
better
go
hereupon
she
recommenced
her
little
drawing
on
her
glove
letting
her
bracelets
drop
again
fastening
the
fur
round
her
throat
well
tatham
she
said
i
hope
you
mean
to
have
the
civility
to
see
after
my
carriage
i
ca
go
roaming
about
hailing
it
as
if
it
were
a
hansom
cab
in
this
queer
place
chapter
xxvii
john
went
down
to
windyhill
that
evening
his
appearance
alarmed
the
little
household
more
than
words
could
say
as
he
was
admitted
at
once
by
the
servants
delighted
to
see
him
he
walked
in
suddenly
into
the
midst
of
a
truly
domestic
scene
the
baby
lay
on
elinor
knee
in
the
midst
of
a
mass
of
white
wrappings
kicking
out
a
pair
of
pink
little
legs
in
the
front
of
the
fire
elinor
herself
was
seated
on
a
very
low
chair
and
illuminated
by
the
cheerful
blaze
which
threw
a
glare
upon
her
countenance
and
called
out
lights
in
her
hair
there
was
no
appearance
in
her
looks
of
anxiety
or
trouble
she
was
altogether
given
up
to
the
baby
and
the
joy
of
its
new
life
the
little
kicking
limbs
the
pleasure
of
the
little
creature
in
the
warmth
the
curling
of
its
rosy
little
toes
in
the
agreeable
sensation
of
the
heat
were
more
to
elinor
and
to
her
mother
who
was
kneeling
beside
her
on
the
than
the
most
refined
and
lofty
pleasures
in
the
world
the
most
lofty
of
us
have
to
come
down
to
those
primitive
sources
of
bliss
if
we
are
happy
enough
to
have
them
placed
in
our
way
the
greatest
poet
by
her
side
the
music
of
the
spheres
sounding
in
her
ear
would
not
have
made
elinor
forget
her
troubles
like
the
stretching
out
towards
the
fire
of
those
little
pink
toes
when
the
door
opened
and
the
voice
and
step
of
a
man
dreaded
sounds
were
audible
a
thrill
of
terror
ran
over
this
little
group
dennistoun
sprang
to
her
feet
and
placed
herself
between
the
intruder
and
the
young
mother
while
elinor
gathered
up
covering
him
all
over
so
that
he
disappeared
altogether
her
child
in
her
arms
it
is
john
said
dennistoun
god
be
thanked
it
is
only
john
but
elinor
quite
overcome
by
the
shock
burst
suddenly
into
tears
to
which
the
baby
responded
by
a
vigorous
cry
not
at
all
relishing
the
sudden
huddling
up
among
its
shawls
to
which
it
had
been
subjected
it
may
be
supposed
what
an
effect
this
cloudy
side
of
the
happiness
which
he
had
not
been
able
to
deny
to
himself
made
a
very
pretty
scene
had
upon
john
he
said
not
without
a
little
offence
i
am
sure
i
beg
your
pardon
humbly
i
go
away
elinor
turned
round
her
head
smiling
through
her
tears
it
was
only
that
you
gave
me
a
fright
she
said
i
am
quite
right
again
do
oh
do
go
away
unless
you
object
to
the
sight
of
baby
and
to
hear
him
cry
but
he
not
cry
now
any
more
than
his
silly
mother
mamma
make
john
sit
down
and
tell
us
oh
i
am
sure
he
has
something
to
tell
us
perhaps
i
took
comfort
too
soon
but
the
very
sight
of
john
is
a
protection
and
a
strength
she
said
holding
out
her
hand
to
him
this
sudden
change
of
front
reduced
john
who
had
been
perhaps
disposed
for
a
moment
to
stand
on
his
dignity
to
utter
subjection
he
neither
said
nor
even
thought
a
word
against
the
baby
who
was
presently
unfolded
again
and
turned
once
more
the
toes
of
comfort
towards
the
fire
he
did
not
approach
too
near
feeling
that
he
had
no
particular
share
in
the
scene
and
indeed
cut
an
almost
absurd
figure
in
the
midst
of
that
group
but
sat
behind
contemplating
it
from
a
little
distance
against
the
fire
the
evening
had
grown
dark
by
this
time
but
the
two
women
absorbed
by
their
worship
had
wanted
no
light
it
had
happened
to
john
by
an
extreme
piece
of
luck
to
catch
the
express
train
almost
as
soon
as
lady
mariamne
had
left
him
and
to
reach
the
station
at
hurrymere
before
the
february
day
was
done
you
have
something
to
tell
us
john
good
news
or
bad
dennistoun
said
good
or
i
should
not
have
come
like
this
unannounced
he
said
the
post
is
quick
enough
for
bad
i
think
you
may
be
quite
at
your
ease
about
the
child
no
claim
will
be
made
on
the
child
elinor
i
think
will
not
be
disturbed
if
she
means
to
take
no
steps
on
her
side
what
steps
said
dennistoun
elinor
turned
her
head
to
look
at
him
anxiously
over
the
back
of
her
chair
i
have
had
a
visit
this
afternoon
he
said
from
elinor
drew
a
long
hurried
breath
she
said
no
name
but
it
was
evident
that
one
was
on
her
lips
a
name
she
never
meant
to
pronounce
more
but
to
which
her
whole
being
thrilled
still
even
when
it
was
unspoken
she
looked
at
him
full
of
eagerness
to
hear
yet
with
a
hand
uplifted
as
if
to
forbid
any
utterance
from
lady
mariamne
how
her
countenance
fell
she
turned
round
again
and
bent
over
her
baby
it
was
a
pang
of
acute
disappointment
he
could
not
but
see
that
went
through
her
though
she
would
not
have
allowed
him
to
say
that
name
strange
inconsistency
it
ran
over
john
too
with
a
sense
of
keen
indignation
as
if
he
had
taken
from
her
an
electric
whose
object
in
coming
to
me
was
to
ascertain
whether
you
intended
to
bring
a
suit
for
divorce
a
cry
rang
through
the
room
elinor
turned
upon
him
for
a
moment
a
face
blazing
with
hot
and
painful
colour
the
lamp
had
been
brought
in
and
he
saw
the
fierce
blush
and
look
of
horror
then
she
turned
round
and
buried
it
in
her
hands
divorce
said
dennistoun
elinor
to
drag
her
private
affairs
before
the
world
oh
john
john
that
could
not
be
you
would
not
wish
that
to
be
i
he
cried
with
a
laugh
of
tuneless
mirth
is
it
likely
that
i
would
wish
to
drag
elinor
before
the
world
elinor
did
not
say
anything
but
withdrew
one
hand
from
her
burning
cheek
and
put
it
into
his
these
women
treated
john
as
if
he
were
a
man
of
wood
what
he
might
be
feeling
or
if
he
were
feeling
anything
did
not
enter
their
minds
it
was
like
her
said
elinor
after
a
time
in
a
low
hurried
voice
to
think
of
that
she
is
the
only
one
who
would
think
of
it
as
if
i
had
ever
thought
or
dreamed
it
is
possible
however
he
said
that
it
might
be
reasonable
enough
i
do
speak
to
elinor
who
had
let
go
his
hand
hastily
but
to
you
aunt
if
it
is
altogether
final
as
she
says
to
be
released
would
perhaps
be
better
from
a
bond
that
was
no
bond
john
john
would
you
have
her
add
shame
to
pain
the
shame
would
not
be
to
her
aunt
the
shame
is
to
every
one
concerned
to
every
one
my
elinor
name
her
dear
name
dragged
through
all
that
mud
she
a
party
perhaps
to
revelations
oh
never
never
we
would
bear
anything
rather
this
of
course
said
john
is
perhaps
a
still
more
bitter
punishment
for
the
other
side
she
looked
round
at
him
again
looking
up
with
a
look
of
pale
horror
her
eyelids
in
agonised
curves
over
her
eyes
her
mouth
quivering
what
did
you
say
john
i
said
it
might
be
a
more
bitter
punishment
still
for
the
other
side
elinor
lifted
up
her
baby
to
her
breast
raising
herself
with
a
new
dignity
with
her
head
high
i
meant
no
punishment
she
said
i
want
none
i
have
left
what
killed
me
behind
me
many
things
not
one
only
i
have
brought
my
boy
away
that
he
may
never
never
but
if
it
would
be
better
that
another
should
be
free
i
will
never
give
my
consent
to
it
elinor
nor
i
with
my
own
mind
but
if
it
is
vindictive
if
it
is
revenge
mother
i
am
not
alone
to
think
of
myself
if
it
were
better
for
that
he
should
be
free
speak
to
john
about
it
and
tell
me
i
can
not
can
not
discuss
it
i
will
leave
it
all
to
john
and
you
it
will
kill
me
but
what
does
that
matter
it
is
not
revenge
that
i
seek
she
turned
with
the
baby
pressed
to
her
breast
and
walked
away
her
every
movement
showing
the
strain
and
excitement
of
her
soul
why
did
you
do
this
john
without
at
least
consulting
me
you
have
thrown
a
new
trouble
into
her
mind
she
will
never
never
do
this
thing
nor
would
i
permit
it
there
are
some
things
in
which
i
must
take
a
part
i
could
not
forbid
her
marriage
god
grant
that
i
had
had
the
strength
to
do
it
but
this
i
will
forbid
to
expose
her
to
the
whole
world
when
everything
we
have
done
has
been
with
the
idea
of
concealing
what
had
happened
never
never
i
will
never
consent
to
it
john
i
had
no
intention
of
proposing
such
a
step
but
the
other
side
as
we
are
bound
to
call
him
are
frightened
about
it
and
when
i
saw
her
look
up
so
young
still
so
sweet
with
all
her
life
before
her
and
thought
how
she
must
spend
it
alone
with
no
expanding
no
development
in
this
cottage
or
somewhere
else
a
life
shipwrecked
a
being
so
capable
so
full
of
possibilities
lost
i
have
spent
my
life
in
this
cottage
said
dennistoun
my
husband
died
when
i
was
thirty
my
life
was
over
and
still
i
was
young
but
i
had
elinor
there
were
some
who
pitied
me
too
but
their
pity
was
uncalled
for
elinor
will
live
like
her
mother
she
has
her
boy
but
it
is
different
you
can
not
but
see
the
difference
yes
i
see
it
it
is
different
but
not
so
different
that
my
name
should
be
placarded
about
the
streets
and
put
in
all
the
newspapers
oh
never
never
john
if
the
man
suffers
it
is
his
fault
she
will
suffer
and
it
is
not
her
fault
but
i
will
not
to
release
him
drag
my
child
before
the
world
dennistoun
was
so
much
excited
that
she
began
to
pace
about
the
room
she
who
was
usually
so
sober
and
self
restrained
she
had
borne
much
but
this
she
was
unable
even
to
contemplate
with
calm
for
once
in
her
life
she
had
arrived
at
something
which
she
would
not
bear
john
felt
his
own
position
very
strange
sitting
looking
on
as
a
spectator
while
this
woman
usually
so
showed
her
impatience
of
circumstances
and
fate
it
was
ruefully
comic
that
this
should
be
so
to
speak
his
doing
though
he
was
the
last
in
the
world
to
desire
any
exposure
of
elinor
or
to
have
any
sympathy
with
those
who
sought
justice
for
themselves
or
revenge
on
others
at
such
a
cost
i
was
rash
perhaps
to
speak
as
i
did
he
said
i
had
no
intention
of
doing
it
when
i
came
it
was
a
mere
impulse
seeing
elinor
but
you
must
know
that
i
agree
with
you
perfectly
i
see
that
elinor
lot
is
fixed
anyhow
i
believe
that
no
decree
of
a
court
would
make
any
difference
to
her
and
she
would
not
change
the
name
that
is
the
child
name
all
that
i
recognise
and
one
thing
more
that
neither
you
nor
elinor
has
recognised
they
he
is
afraid
of
any
proceedings
i
suppose
i
may
mention
him
to
you
it
rather
absurd
do
you
think
speaking
of
a
fellow
of
that
sort
or
rather
not
speaking
of
him
at
all
as
if
his
name
was
sacred
he
is
afraid
of
proceedings
whatever
may
be
the
cause
john
ca
you
understand
that
she
can
not
bear
to
speak
of
him
a
man
she
so
fought
for
against
us
all
and
now
her
eyes
are
opened
she
is
undeceived
she
knows
him
all
through
and
through
more
far
more
than
we
do
she
opened
her
mind
to
me
once
and
only
once
it
was
not
alone
oh
no
no
there
are
things
that
rankle
more
than
that
something
he
did
before
they
were
married
and
made
her
help
him
to
conceal
something
dishon
i
ca
say
the
word
john
oh
said
john
grimly
you
need
not
mind
me
well
the
woman
i
blush
to
have
to
speak
to
you
even
of
such
a
thing
the
woman
john
was
not
the
worst
she
almost
might
i
think
have
forgiven
that
it
was
one
thing
after
another
and
that
that
first
business
the
worst
of
all
she
found
it
out
somehow
and
he
had
made
her
take
a
part
i
ca
tell
what
she
would
never
open
her
lips
on
the
subject
again
only
that
once
it
all
burst
forth
oh
divorce
what
would
that
do
to
her
besides
the
shame
you
understand
some
things
john
said
dennistoun
with
a
smile
though
you
are
a
man
she
would
never
do
anything
to
give
herself
a
name
different
from
her
child
yes
said
john
with
a
laugh
i
think
i
understand
a
thing
or
two
though
as
you
say
my
dear
aunt
i
am
only
a
man
however
it
is
just
as
well
i
am
that
imperfect
creature
to
take
care
of
you
it
understands
the
tactics
of
the
wicked
better
than
you
do
and
now
you
must
persuade
elinor
and
persuade
yourself
of
what
i
came
here
on
purpose
to
tell
you
not
to
disturb
you
as
i
have
been
so
unfortunate
as
to
do
you
are
perfectly
safe
from
him
i
will
not
let
the
enemy
know
your
sentiments
or
how
decided
you
are
on
the
subject
i
will
perhaps
if
you
will
let
me
crack
the
whip
a
little
over
their
heads
and
keep
them
in
a
pleasing
uncertainty
but
as
long
as
he
is
afraid
that
she
will
take
proceedings
against
him
he
will
take
none
you
may
be
sure
against
her
so
you
may
throw
aside
all
your
precautions
and
be
happy
over
your
treasure
in
your
own
way
thank
god
for
what
you
say
john
you
take
a
weight
off
my
heart
but
happy
how
can
you
speak
of
being
happy
after
such
a
catastrophe
i
thought
i
came
in
upon
a
very
happy
little
scene
it
might
be
only
pretence
but
it
looked
uncommonly
like
the
real
thing
you
mean
the
baby
john
the
dear
infant
that
knows
no
harm
he
does
take
off
our
thoughts
a
little
and
enable
us
to
bear
oh
aunt
do
be
a
hypocrite
that
was
never
a
fault
of
yours
confess
that
with
all
your
misery
about
elinor
you
are
happy
to
have
her
here
and
her
child
notwithstanding
everything
happy
as
you
have
not
been
for
many
a
day
she
sat
down
by
him
and
gave
him
her
hand
john
to
be
a
man
you
have
wonderful
insight
and
it
i
who
am
a
very
very
imperfect
creature
you
do
think
worse
of
me
to
be
glad
to
have
her
even
though
it
is
purchased
by
such
misery
and
trouble
god
knows
cried
the
poor
lady
drying
her
eyes
that
i
would
give
her
up
and
with
joy
and
consent
never
to
see
her
again
if
that
would
be
for
her
happiness
john
i
not
thrust
myself
upon
them
have
i
nor
done
anything
against
him
nor
said
a
word
but
now
that
she
is
here
and
the
baby
and
all
to
myself
which
i
never
hoped
would
i
not
be
an
ungrateful
woman
if
i
did
not
thank
god
for
it
john
you
are
an
excellent
special
pleader
aunt
he
said
with
a
laugh
as
most
women
whom
i
have
known
are
and
i
agree
with
you
in
everything
you
behaved
to
them
while
it
was
angelically
you
effaced
yourself
and
i
fully
believe
you
never
said
a
word
against
him
also
i
believe
that
if
circumstances
changed
if
anything
happened
to
make
her
see
that
she
could
go
back
to
him
dennistoun
started
in
spite
of
herself
and
pressed
her
hands
together
with
a
half
sob
of
dismay
i
do
think
it
likely
but
if
it
were
so
you
would
sacrifice
yourself
again
i
have
a
doubt
of
it
why
then
set
up
this
piece
of
humbug
to
me
who
know
you
so
well
and
pretend
that
you
are
not
very
happy
for
the
moment
you
are
and
you
have
a
good
right
to
be
and
i
say
enjoy
it
my
dear
aunt
take
all
the
good
of
it
you
will
have
no
trouble
from
him
you
think
so
you
really
think
so
john
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
and
you
must
persuade
elinor
do
think
i
am
making
light
of
the
situation
you
have
plenty
to
trouble
you
no
doubt
when
that
little
shaver
grows
up
john
well
he
is
a
little
shaver
whatever
that
may
mean
i
sure
i
know
if
he
were
a
little
prince
when
he
grows
up
you
will
have
your
business
laid
out
for
you
and
i
do
envy
you
the
clearing
up
john
do
speak
as
if
a
time
would
come
when
you
would
not
stand
by
us
i
mean
stand
by
elinor
your
first
phrase
was
much
the
best
i
will
stand
by
you
both
as
a
matter
of
course
you
must
consider
i
shall
be
an
old
woman
then
and
who
knows
if
i
may
live
to
see
the
poor
little
darling
grow
up
the
poor
little
darling
may
never
grow
up
and
none
of
us
may
live
to
see
it
one
prediction
is
as
good
as
another
but
i
think
better
things
of
you
aunt
than
that
you
would
go
and
die
and
desert
elinor
unless
be
as
you
could
help
it
as
pearson
says
but
however
in
the
meantime
dying
of
anybody
is
not
in
the
question
and
i
hope
both
you
and
she
will
take
as
much
pleasure
out
of
the
baby
and
be
as
happy
as
circumstances
will
allow
and
i
tell
pearson
that
there
is
no
need
for
him
to
act
the
dragon
either
the
bible
one
whom
he
did
not
think
you
would
like
to
have
about
the
house
or
any
other
for
the
danger
is
over
trust
me
at
least
for
that
i
trust
you
for
everything
john
but
added
dennistoun
i
would
say
anything
to
pearson
if
you
told
him
to
be
a
dragon
let
him
be
a
dragon
still
i
am
sure
you
are
right
and
i
will
tell
elinor
so
and
comfort
her
heart
but
we
may
as
well
keep
a
good
look
out
and
our
eyes
about
us
all
the
same
they
are
sure
i
am
right
but
think
it
better
to
go
on
as
if
i
were
wrong
john
said
to
himself
as
he
went
to
dress
for
dinner
and
while
he
went
through
this
ceremony
he
had
a
great
many
thoughts
of
the
wonderful
ways
of
women
which
are
so
amazing
to
men
in
general
as
the
ways
of
men
are
amazing
to
women
and
will
be
so
no
doubt
as
long
as
the
world
goes
on
the
strange
mixture
of
the
wise
and
the
foolish
the
altogether
heroic
and
the
involuntarily
fictitious
struck
his
keen
perception
with
a
humourous
understanding
and
amusement
and
sympathy
that
dennistoun
should
pose
a
little
as
a
sufferer
while
she
was
unmitigatedly
happy
in
the
possession
of
elinor
and
the
child
and
be
abashed
when
she
was
forced
to
confess
how
ecstatic
was
the
fearful
joy
which
she
snatched
in
the
midst
of
danger
was
strange
enough
but
that
elinor
at
this
dreadful
crisis
of
her
life
when
every
bond
was
rent
asunder
and
all
that
is
ordinarily
called
happiness
wrecked
for
ever
should
be
moved
to
the
kind
of
rapture
he
had
seen
in
her
face
by
the
reaching
out
and
curling
in
of
those
little
pink
toes
in
the
warm
light
of
the
fire
was
inconceivable
a
thing
that
was
not
in
any
philosophy
she
had
made
shipwreck
of
her
life
she
had
torn
the
man
whom
she
loved
out
of
her
heart
and
fled
from
his
neglect
and
treachery
a
fugitive
to
her
mother
house
and
yet
as
she
sat
before
the
fire
with
this
little
infant
cooing
in
the
warmth
like
a
puppy
or
a
little
pig
or
any
other
little
animal
you
can
suggest
this
was
the
thought
of
the
irreverent
man
there
was
a
look
of
almost
more
than
common
happiness
of
blessedness
in
her
face
who
can
fathom
these
things
they
were
at
least
beyond
the
knowledge
though
not
the
sympathy
of
this
very
rising
member
of
the
bar
chapter
xxviii
thus
there
came
a
sort
of
settling
down
and
composure
of
affairs
phil
compton
and
all
belonging
to
him
disappeared
from
the
scene
and
elinor
returned
to
all
the
habits
of
her
old
life
all
the
habits
with
one
extraordinary
and
incalculable
addition
which
changed
all
these
habits
the
baby
so
inconsiderable
a
little
creature
not
able
to
show
a
feeling
or
express
a
thought
or
make
even
a
tremulous
step
from
one
pair
of
loving
arms
to
another
an
altogether
helpless
little
bundle
but
nevertheless
one
who
had
already
altered
the
existence
of
the
cottage
and
its
inhabitants
and
made
life
a
totally
different
thing
for
them
can
i
tell
how
this
was
done
no
doubt
for
the
wisest
objects
to
guard
the
sacred
seed
of
the
race
as
mere
duty
could
never
guard
it
rendering
it
the
one
thing
most
precious
in
the
world
to
those
to
whom
it
is
confided
at
least
to
most
of
them
when
that
love
fails
then
is
the
deepest
abyss
of
misery
reached
i
do
not
say
that
elinor
was
happy
in
this
dreadful
breaking
up
of
her
life
or
that
her
heart
did
not
go
back
with
those
relentings
which
are
the
worst
part
of
every
disruption
to
the
man
who
had
broken
her
heart
and
unsettled
her
nature
the
remembrance
of
him
in
his
better
moments
would
flash
upon
her
and
bear
every
resentment
away
dreadful
thoughts
of
how
she
might
herself
have
done
otherwise
have
rendered
their
mutual
life
better
would
come
over
her
and
next
moment
recollections
still
more
terrible
of
what
he
had
done
and
said
the
scorn
she
had
borne
the
insults
the
neglect
and
worse
of
all
the
complicity
he
had
forced
upon
her
by
which
he
had
made
her
guilty
when
she
knew
and
feared
nothing
when
these
thoughts
overcame
her
as
they
did
twenty
times
in
a
day
for
it
is
the
worst
of
such
troubles
that
they
will
not
be
settled
by
one
struggle
but
come
back
and
back
beginning
over
again
at
the
same
point
after
we
have
wrestled
through
them
and
have
thought
that
we
had
come
to
a
close
when
these
thoughts
i
say
overcame
her
she
would
rush
to
the
room
in
which
the
baby
held
his
throne
and
press
him
to
the
heart
which
was
beating
so
hotly
till
it
grew
calm
and
in
the
midst
of
all
to
sit
down
by
the
fire
with
the
little
atom
of
humanity
in
her
lap
and
see
it
spread
and
stretch
its
rosy
limbs
would
suffice
to
bring
again
to
her
face
that
beatitude
which
had
filled
john
tatham
with
wonder
unspeakable
she
took
the
baby
and
laid
him
on
her
heart
to
take
the
pain
away
and
so
after
a
minute
or
two
there
was
no
more
question
of
pain
but
of
happiness
and
delicious
play
and
the
raptures
of
motherhood
how
strange
were
these
things
she
could
not
understand
it
herself
and
fortunately
did
not
try
but
accepted
that
solace
provided
by
god
as
for
dennistoun
she
made
no
longer
any
pretences
to
herself
but
allowed
herself
as
john
had
advised
to
take
her
blessedness
frankly
without
hypocrisy
when
elinor
dear
face
was
veiled
by
misery
her
mother
was
sympathetically
miserable
but
at
all
other
moments
her
heart
sang
for
joy
she
had
her
child
again
and
she
had
her
child
child
an
endless
occupation
amusement
and
delight
all
this
might
come
to
an
end
who
can
tell
when
but
for
the
moment
her
house
was
no
more
lonely
the
requirements
of
her
being
were
satisfied
she
had
her
elinor
what
more
was
to
be
said
and
yet
there
was
more
to
be
said
for
in
addition
there
was
the
boy
this
was
very
well
so
far
as
the
interior
of
the
house
and
of
their
living
was
concerned
but
very
soon
other
difficulties
arose
it
had
been
dennistoun
desire
when
she
returned
home
to
communicate
some
modified
version
of
what
had
happened
to
the
neighbours
around
she
had
thought
it
would
not
only
be
wise
but
easier
for
themselves
that
their
position
should
be
understood
in
the
little
parish
society
which
if
it
did
not
know
authoritatively
would
certainly
inquire
and
investigate
and
divine
with
the
result
of
perhaps
believing
more
than
the
truth
perhaps
setting
up
an
entirely
fictitious
explanation
which
it
would
be
impossible
to
set
aside
and
very
hard
to
bear
it
is
the
worst
of
knowing
a
number
of
people
intimately
and
being
known
by
them
from
the
time
your
children
were
in
their
cradles
that
every
domestic
incident
requires
some
sort
of
explanation
to
this
close
little
circle
of
spectators
but
elinor
who
had
not
the
experience
of
her
mother
in
such
matters
nor
the
knowledge
of
life
made
a
strenuous
opposition
to
this
she
would
not
have
anything
said
it
was
better
she
thought
to
leave
it
to
their
imagination
if
they
chose
to
interfere
with
their
neighbours
concerns
and
imagine
anything
but
why
should
they
occupy
themselves
about
us
and
they
have
no
imaginations
she
said
with
a
contempt
of
her
neighbours
which
is
natural
to
young
people
though
very
unjustifiable
but
my
darling
dennistoun
would
say
the
position
is
so
strange
there
are
not
many
young
women
who
and
there
must
be
some
way
of
accounting
for
it
let
us
just
tell
them
for
heaven
sake
mamma
tell
them
nothing
i
have
come
to
pay
you
a
long
visit
after
my
neglect
of
you
for
these
two
years
which
of
course
they
know
well
enough
what
more
do
they
want
to
know
it
is
a
very
good
reason
and
while
baby
is
so
young
of
course
it
is
far
better
for
him
to
be
in
a
settled
home
where
he
can
be
properly
attended
to
than
moving
about
is
that
enough
well
elinor
at
least
you
will
let
me
say
as
much
as
that
oh
they
can
surely
make
it
out
for
themselves
what
is
the
use
of
always
talking
a
matter
over
to
lead
to
a
little
more
and
a
little
more
till
the
appetite
for
gossip
is
satisfied
surely
in
our
circumstances
least
said
is
soonest
mended
elinor
said
with
that
air
of
superior
understanding
which
almost
always
resides
in
persons
of
the
younger
generation
dennistoun
said
no
more
to
her
but
she
did
take
advantage
of
the
explanation
thus
suggested
she
informed
the
anxious
circle
at
the
rectory
that
elinor
had
come
to
her
on
a
long
visit
partly
for
me
and
partly
for
the
baby
she
said
with
one
of
those
smiles
which
are
either
the
height
of
duplicity
or
the
most
pathetic
evidence
of
according
as
you
choose
to
regard
them
she
thinks
she
has
neglected
her
mother
though
i
am
sure
i
have
never
blamed
her
and
she
thinks
of
which
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
to
carry
an
infant
of
that
age
moving
about
from
place
to
place
is
the
worst
thing
in
the
world
and
that
i
am
very
thankful
she
should
think
so
i
need
not
say
it
is
very
nice
for
you
dear
dennistoun
hudson
said
and
a
good
thing
for
elinor
said
alice
for
she
is
looking
very
poorly
i
have
always
heard
that
fashionable
life
took
a
great
deal
out
of
you
if
you
are
not
quite
brought
up
to
it
i
am
sure
i
stand
it
the
young
lady
said
with
fervour
who
had
never
had
that
painful
delight
in
her
power
that
is
all
very
well
said
the
rector
rubbing
his
hands
but
what
does
compton
say
to
it
i
do
want
to
say
a
word
against
your
arrangements
my
dear
lady
but
you
know
there
must
be
some
one
on
the
husband
side
now
i
am
on
the
husband
side
and
i
am
sorry
for
the
poor
young
man
i
hope
he
is
going
to
join
his
wife
i
hope
excuse
me
for
saying
it
that
elinor
though
we
are
all
so
delighted
to
see
her
will
not
forsake
him
for
too
long
and
then
dennistoun
felt
herself
compelled
to
embroider
a
little
upon
her
theme
he
has
to
be
a
great
deal
abroad
during
this
year
she
said
he
has
a
great
many
things
to
do
elinor
does
not
know
when
he
will
be
home
that
is
one
reason
to
be
sure
to
be
sure
the
rector
said
rubbing
his
hands
still
more
and
coming
to
her
aid
just
as
she
was
breaking
down
something
diplomatic
of
course
well
we
must
not
inquire
into
the
secrets
of
the
state
but
what
an
ease
to
his
mind
my
dear
lady
to
think
that
his
wife
and
child
will
be
safe
with
you
while
he
away
mary
dale
not
being
present
could
not
of
course
say
anything
she
was
a
person
who
was
always
dreadfully
well
informed
it
was
a
comfort
unspeakable
that
at
this
moment
she
was
away
this
explanation
made
the
spring
pass
quietly
enough
but
not
without
many
questions
that
brought
the
blood
to
elinor
face
when
she
was
asked
by
some
one
for
the
first
time
when
do
you
expect
compton
elinor
the
sudden
wild
flush
of
colour
which
flooded
her
countenance
startled
the
questioner
as
much
as
the
question
did
herself
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
said
the
injudicious
but
perfectly
innocent
seeker
for
information
i
fear
that
elinor
fell
upon
her
mother
after
this
and
demanded
to
know
what
she
had
said
but
as
dennistoun
was
innocent
of
anything
but
having
said
that
philip
was
abroad
there
was
no
satisfaction
to
be
got
out
of
that
some
time
after
one
of
the
miss
hills
congratulated
elinor
having
seen
in
the
papers
that
compton
was
returning
to
town
for
the
season
i
suppose
dear
elinor
we
have
you
with
us
much
longer
this
lady
said
and
then
it
became
known
at
the
cottage
that
mary
dale
was
returning
to
the
rectory
this
was
the
last
aggravation
and
elinor
who
had
now
recovered
her
strength
and
energy
and
temper
along
with
it
received
the
news
with
an
outburst
of
impatience
which
frightened
her
mother
you
may
as
well
go
through
the
parish
and
ring
the
bell
and
tell
everybody
everything
she
said
mary
dale
will
have
heard
all
and
a
great
deal
more
than
all
she
will
come
with
her
budget
and
pour
it
out
far
and
wide
she
will
report
scenes
that
never
took
place
and
quarrels
and
all
that
that
woman
insinuated
to
john
and
she
will
be
surrounded
with
people
who
will
shake
their
heads
and
sink
their
voices
when
we
come
in
and
say
elinor
i
can
not
bear
it
i
can
not
bear
it
she
cried
my
darling
that
was
bound
to
come
sooner
or
later
we
must
set
our
faces
like
a
rock
and
look
as
if
we
were
unaware
of
anything
i
can
not
look
as
if
i
were
unaware
i
can
not
meet
all
their
cruel
eyes
i
can
see
now
the
smile
on
mary
dale
face
that
will
say
told
you
so
i
shall
hear
her
say
it
even
when
i
am
in
my
room
with
the
combe
between
i
know
exactly
how
she
will
say
it
elinor
had
listened
to
me
elinor
said
poor
dennistoun
i
can
not
contradict
you
dear
it
will
be
so
but
none
of
them
are
cruel
not
even
mary
dale
they
will
make
their
remarks
who
could
help
it
we
should
ourselves
if
it
were
some
one
else
case
but
they
will
not
be
cruel
do
think
so
they
will
be
full
of
sympathy
which
is
a
great
deal
worse
elinor
said
in
her
unreason
the
one
might
be
borne
but
the
other
i
will
not
endure
sympathy
yes
they
will
all
be
sorry
for
me
they
will
say
they
knew
how
it
would
be
oh
i
know
i
have
not
profited
as
i
ought
by
what
has
happened
to
me
i
am
unsubdued
i
am
as
impatient
and
as
proud
as
ever
it
is
quite
true
but
it
can
not
be
mended
it
is
more
than
i
can
bear
my
darling
said
her
mother
again
we
all
say
that
in
our
trouble
and
yet
we
know
that
we
have
got
to
bear
it
all
the
same
it
is
intolerable
one
says
that
a
thousand
times
and
yet
it
has
to
be
put
up
with
all
the
time
that
we
have
been
flattering
ourselves
that
nobody
took
any
notice
it
has
been
a
delusion
elinor
how
could
it
be
otherwise
we
must
set
our
faces
not
i
mamma
she
said
not
i
i
must
go
away
go
away
elinor
among
strangers
where
nobody
has
heard
of
me
before
where
nobody
can
make
any
remark
to
live
like
this
among
a
crowd
of
people
who
think
they
ought
to
know
everything
that
one
is
doing
who
are
nothing
to
you
and
yet
whom
you
stand
in
awe
of
and
must
explain
everything
to
it
is
this
that
is
intolerable
i
can
not
can
not
bear
it
mother
i
will
take
my
baby
and
i
will
go
away
where
said
dennistoun
with
all
the
colour
fading
out
of
her
face
what
panic
had
taken
her
i
can
not
tell
she
grew
pale
to
her
lips
and
the
words
were
almost
inaudible
which
she
breathed
forth
i
think
she
thought
for
a
moment
that
elinor
heart
had
turned
that
she
was
going
back
to
her
husband
to
find
refuge
with
him
from
the
strife
of
tongues
which
she
could
not
encounter
alone
all
the
blood
went
back
upon
the
mother
heart
yet
she
set
herself
to
suppress
all
emotion
and
if
this
should
be
so
not
to
oppose
it
for
was
it
not
the
thing
of
all
others
to
be
desired
the
thing
which
everybody
would
approve
the
reuniting
of
those
whom
god
had
put
together
though
it
might
be
death
to
her
not
a
word
of
opposition
would
she
say
where
how
can
i
tell
where
anywhere
anywhere
out
of
the
world
cried
elinor
in
the
boiling
tide
of
her
impatience
and
wretchedness
where
nobody
ever
heard
of
us
before
where
there
will
be
no
one
to
ask
no
one
to
require
a
reason
where
we
should
be
free
to
move
when
we
please
and
do
as
we
please
let
me
go
mother
it
seemed
too
dear
too
peaceful
to
come
home
but
now
home
itself
has
become
intolerable
i
will
take
my
baby
and
i
will
go
to
the
farthest
point
the
railway
can
take
me
to
with
no
servant
to
betray
me
not
even
an
address
mother
let
me
go
away
and
be
lost
let
me
be
as
if
i
had
never
been
and
me
am
i
to
remain
to
bear
the
brunt
behind
and
you
mamma
oh
i
am
the
most
unworthy
creature
i
do
deserve
to
have
you
i
that
am
always
giving
you
pain
why
should
i
unroot
you
from
your
place
where
you
have
lived
so
long
from
your
flowers
and
your
landscape
and
your
pretty
rooms
that
were
always
a
comfort
to
think
of
in
that
horrible
time
when
i
was
away
i
always
liked
to
think
of
you
here
happy
and
quiet
in
the
place
you
had
chosen
flowers
and
landscapes
are
pretty
things
said
dennistoun
whose
colour
had
begun
to
come
again
a
little
but
they
do
make
up
for
one
children
we
must
not
do
anything
rashly
elinor
but
if
what
you
mean
is
really
that
you
will
go
away
to
a
strange
place
among
strangers
what
else
could
i
mean
elinor
said
and
then
she
in
her
turn
grew
pale
if
you
thought
i
could
mean
that
i
would
go
back
oh
my
darling
my
darling
god
knows
if
we
are
right
or
wrong
i
not
to
advise
you
so
or
you
not
to
take
my
advice
elinor
it
is
my
duty
and
i
will
say
it
though
it
were
to
break
my
heart
there
only
could
you
avoid
this
strife
of
tongues
john
spoke
the
truth
he
said
as
the
boy
grew
up
we
should
have
many
troubles
i
have
known
women
endure
everything
that
their
children
might
grow
up
in
a
natural
situation
in
their
proper
sphere
think
of
this
i
am
saying
it
against
my
own
interest
against
my
own
heart
but
think
of
it
elinor
whatever
you
might
have
to
bear
you
would
be
in
your
natural
place
elinor
received
this
agitated
address
standing
up
holding
her
head
high
her
nostrils
expanded
her
lips
apart
have
you
quite
done
mother
she
said
dennistoun
made
an
appealing
movement
with
her
hands
and
sank
without
any
power
to
add
a
word
into
a
chair
i
am
glad
you
said
it
against
your
heart
now
you
must
feel
that
your
conscience
is
clear
mother
if
i
had
to
wander
the
world
from
place
to
place
without
even
a
spot
of
ground
on
which
to
rest
my
foot
i
would
never
never
do
what
you
say
what
take
my
child
to
grow
up
in
that
tainted
air
give
him
up
to
be
taught
such
things
as
they
teach
never
never
never
his
natural
place
did
you
say
i
would
rather
the
slums
of
london
were
his
natural
place
he
would
have
some
chance
there
if
i
could
bear
it
for
myself
yet
i
could
not
for
him
for
him
most
of
all
i
will
take
him
up
in
my
arms
thank
god
i
am
strong
now
and
can
carry
him
and
go
away
among
strangers
i
do
care
where
where
there
can
be
no
questions
and
no
remarks
but
not
without
me
elinor
oh
mother
mother
what
a
child
i
am
to
you
to
rend
your
heart
as
i
have
done
and
now
to
tear
you
out
of
your
house
and
home
my
home
is
where
my
children
are
dennistoun
said
and
then
she
made
a
little
pause
but
we
must
think
it
over
elinor
such
a
step
as
this
must
not
be
taken
rashly
we
will
ask
john
to
come
down
and
advise
us
my
dear
no
mother
not
john
or
any
one
i
will
go
first
if
you
like
and
find
a
place
and
you
will
join
me
after
that
woman
it
was
poor
mary
dale
who
was
indeed
full
of
information
but
meant
no
harm
is
coming
directly
i
will
not
wait
here
to
see
her
or
their
faces
after
she
has
told
them
all
the
lies
she
will
have
heard
i
am
not
going
to
take
advice
from
any
one
let
me
alone
mother
i
must
i
must
go
away
but
not
by
yourself
elinor
dennistoun
said
this
was
how
it
happened
that
john
tatham
who
had
meant
to
go
down
to
the
cottage
the
very
next
saturday
to
see
how
things
were
going
was
driven
into
a
kind
of
stupefaction
one
morning
in
may
by
a
letter
which
reached
him
from
the
north
a
letter
conveying
news
so
unexpected
and
sudden
so
unlike
anything
that
had
seemed
possible
that
he
laid
it
down
when
it
was
half
read
with
a
gasp
of
astonishment
unable
to
believe
his
eyes
chapter
xxix
it
was
dennistoun
whose
letter
brought
john
tatham
such
dismay
it
was
dated
lakeside
waterdale
penrith
an
address
with
which
he
had
no
associations
whatever
and
which
he
gazed
at
blankly
for
a
moment
before
he
attempted
to
read
the
letter
not
knowing
how
to
connect
it
with
the
writing
which
was
as
familiar
as
the
common
day
you
will
wonder
to
see
this
address
she
wrote
you
will
wonder
still
more
dear
john
when
i
tell
you
we
have
come
here
for
good
i
have
left
the
cottage
in
an
agent
hands
with
the
hope
of
letting
it
windyhill
is
such
a
healthy
place
that
i
hope
somebody
will
soon
be
found
to
take
it
you
know
elinor
would
not
let
me
make
any
explanation
and
the
constant
questions
and
allusions
to
movements
which
people
had
seen
in
the
papers
and
so
forth
had
got
on
her
nerves
poor
child
you
can
understand
how
easily
this
might
come
about
at
last
she
got
that
she
could
not
bear
it
longer
mary
dale
who
always
lives
half
the
year
with
her
sister
at
the
rectory
was
coming
back
you
know
it
was
she
who
brought
the
first
tale
about
him
and
she
knows
i
think
all
the
gossip
that
ever
was
got
up
about
any
one
poor
elinor
though
i
do
believe
mary
had
any
bad
meaning
and
it
would
alas
have
been
for
all
our
good
had
we
listened
to
what
she
said
elinor
can
not
bear
her
and
when
she
heard
she
was
coming
she
declared
she
would
take
her
baby
and
go
away
i
tried
to
bring
her
to
reason
but
i
could
not
naturally
it
was
she
who
convinced
me
you
know
the
process
john
indeed
in
many
things
i
can
see
it
is
the
best
thing
we
could
do
i
am
not
supremely
attached
to
windyhill
the
cottage
had
got
to
be
very
homelike
after
living
in
it
so
long
but
home
is
where
those
are
whom
one
loves
and
to
live
among
one
set
of
people
for
so
many
years
if
it
has
great
advantages
has
at
the
same
time
very
great
disadvantages
too
you
ca
keep
anything
to
yourself
you
must
explain
every
step
you
take
and
everything
that
happens
to
you
this
is
a
lovely
country
a
little
cold
as
yet
and
a
little
damp
perhaps
being
so
near
the
lake
but
the
mountains
are
beautiful
and
the
air
delicious
elinor
is
out
all
the
day
long
and
baby
grows
like
a
flower
you
must
come
and
see
us
as
soon
as
ever
you
can
that
is
one
dreadful
drawback
that
we
shall
not
have
you
running
up
and
down
from
saturday
to
monday
and
i
am
afraid
you
will
be
vexed
with
us
that
we
did
not
take
your
advice
first
you
who
have
always
been
our
adviser
but
elinor
would
not
hear
a
word
of
any
advice
i
think
she
was
afraid
you
would
disapprove
and
it
would
have
been
worse
to
fly
in
your
face
if
you
had
disapproved
than
to
come
away
without
consulting
you
and
you
know
how
impetuous
she
is
at
all
events
the
die
is
cast
write
kindly
to
her
do
say
anything
to
vex
her
you
can
let
yourself
out
if
you
are
very
angry
upon
me
one
thing
more
she
desires
that
if
you
write
you
should
address
her
as
only
no
honourable
that
might
attract
attention
and
what
we
desire
is
to
escape
notice
altogether
which
i
am
sure
is
a
thing
you
will
thoroughly
understand
now
that
we
have
transplanted
ourselves
so
completely
dear
john
form
the
most
favourable
idea
you
can
of
this
sudden
step
and
come
and
see
us
as
soon
as
it
is
possible
yours
to
say
that
john
was
thunderstruck
by
this
letter
is
to
describe
his
sensations
mildly
for
he
was
for
a
time
bitterly
angry
wounded
disappointed
disturbed
to
the
bottom
of
his
soul
but
perhaps
if
truth
were
told
it
could
scarcely
be
said
that
he
disapproved
he
thought
it
over
which
he
naturally
did
all
that
day
to
the
great
detriment
of
his
work
first
with
a
sort
of
rage
against
elinor
and
her
impetuosity
which
presently
shaded
down
into
understanding
of
her
feelings
and
ended
in
a
sense
that
he
might
have
known
it
from
the
first
and
that
really
no
other
conclusion
was
possible
he
came
gradually
to
acquiesce
in
the
step
the
ladies
had
taken
to
have
to
explain
everything
to
the
hudsons
and
hills
and
mary
dales
to
open
up
your
most
sacred
heart
in
order
that
they
might
be
able
to
form
a
theory
sufficient
for
their
outside
purposes
of
your
motives
and
methods
or
what
was
perhaps
worse
still
to
know
that
they
were
on
the
watch
guessing
what
you
did
not
tell
them
putting
things
together
explaining
this
and
that
in
their
own
way
would
have
been
intolerable
that
is
the
good
of
having
attached
friends
john
exclaimed
to
himself
very
unjustly
for
it
is
human
nature
that
is
to
blame
if
there
is
any
blame
attaching
to
an
exercise
of
ingenuity
so
inevitable
as
a
matter
of
fact
when
miss
dale
brought
the
true
or
something
like
the
true
account
to
windyhill
the
warmth
of
the
sympathy
for
elinor
the
wrath
of
the
whole
community
with
her
unworthy
husband
was
almost
impassioned
had
she
been
there
it
would
not
have
been
possible
for
those
good
people
altogether
to
conceal
from
her
how
sorry
and
how
indignant
they
were
even
perhaps
there
might
have
been
some
who
could
not
have
kept
out
of
their
eyes
who
must
have
betrayed
in
some
word
or
shake
of
the
head
the
i
told
you
so
which
is
so
dear
to
human
nature
but
how
was
it
possible
that
they
could
remain
uninterested
unaffected
by
the
trouble
in
the
midst
of
them
or
even
appear
to
be
so
john
like
elinor
threw
a
fiery
dart
of
impatience
at
the
country
neighbours
not
allowing
that
everywhere
in
the
greatest
town
in
the
most
cosmopolitan
community
this
would
have
been
the
same
the
chattering
gossips
he
said
as
if
a
club
would
not
have
been
a
great
deal
worse
as
if
indeed
his
own
club
vaguely
conscious
of
a
connection
by
marriage
between
him
and
the
phil
had
not
discussed
it
all
behind
his
back
long
ago
but
on
the
whole
john
was
forced
not
to
disapprove
to
say
that
he
went
the
length
of
approving
would
be
too
much
and
to
deny
that
he
launched
forth
a
tremendous
letter
upon
dennistoun
who
always
bore
the
brunt
is
more
than
my
conscience
would
permit
he
did
do
this
throwing
out
as
the
french
say
fire
and
flame
but
a
few
days
after
followed
it
up
by
a
much
milder
letter
need
i
say
this
was
addressed
to
elinor
allowing
that
he
understood
their
motives
and
that
perhaps
from
their
own
point
of
view
they
were
not
so
very
much
to
blame
you
will
find
it
very
damp
very
cold
very
different
from
windyhill
he
said
with
a
sort
of
savage
satisfaction
but
as
it
happened
to
be
unusually
good
weather
among
the
lakes
when
his
letter
came
this
dart
did
not
do
much
harm
and
that
john
felt
the
revolution
in
his
habits
consequent
upon
this
move
very
much
it
would
be
futile
to
deny
to
have
nowhere
to
go
to
freely
when
he
pleased
from
saturday
to
monday
he
had
at
least
a
score
of
places
but
none
like
the
cottage
made
a
wonderful
difference
in
his
life
but
perhaps
when
he
came
to
think
of
it
soberly
as
he
did
so
often
in
the
brilliant
saturday
afternoons
of
early
summer
when
the
sunshine
on
the
trees
made
his
heart
a
little
sick
with
the
idea
that
he
had
as
he
said
to
himself
nowhere
to
go
to
he
was
not
sure
that
the
difference
was
not
on
the
whole
to
his
advantage
a
man
perhaps
should
not
have
it
in
his
power
to
enjoy
in
the
most
fraternal
intimacy
the
society
of
another
man
wife
whenever
he
pleased
even
if
to
her
he
was
as
he
knew
of
as
little
importance
notwithstanding
that
she
was
as
she
would
have
said
so
fond
of
john
as
the
postman
say
or
any
other
secondary
yet
sufficiently
interesting
figure
in
the
country
neighbourhood
john
knew
in
his
heart
of
hearts
that
this
was
not
a
good
thing
nor
a
wholesome
thing
for
him
he
was
not
a
man
as
has
been
said
who
would
ever
have
hurried
events
or
insisted
upon
appropriating
a
woman
even
when
he
loved
her
and
securing
her
as
his
very
own
he
would
always
have
been
able
to
put
that
off
to
subordinate
it
to
the
necessity
of
getting
on
in
the
world
and
securing
his
position
and
he
was
by
no
means
sure
when
he
questioned
his
own
heart
which
was
a
thing
he
did
seldom
knowing
like
a
wise
man
that
that
shifty
subject
often
made
queer
revelations
and
was
not
at
all
an
easy
object
to
that
the
intercourse
which
he
had
again
dropped
into
with
elinor
was
not
on
the
whole
as
much
as
he
required
there
was
no
doubt
that
it
kept
him
alive
from
one
period
to
another
kept
his
heart
moderately
light
and
his
mind
wonderfully
contented
as
nothing
else
had
ever
done
he
looked
forward
to
his
fortnightly
or
monthly
visit
to
the
cottage
sometimes
one
and
sometimes
the
other
he
never
indulged
himself
so
far
as
to
go
every
week
and
it
gave
him
happiness
enough
to
tide
over
all
the
dull
moments
between
and
if
anything
came
in
his
way
and
detained
him
even
from
his
usual
to
a
later
train
he
was
ridiculously
absurdly
angry
what
right
had
he
to
feel
so
in
respect
to
another
man
wife
what
right
had
he
to
watch
the
child
the
child
whom
he
disliked
so
much
to
begin
with
developing
its
baby
faculties
with
an
interest
he
was
half
ashamed
of
but
which
went
on
increasing
another
man
wife
and
another
man
child
he
saw
now
that
it
was
not
a
wholesome
thing
for
him
and
he
could
never
have
given
it
up
had
they
remained
it
had
become
too
much
a
part
of
his
living
should
he
not
be
glad
therefore
that
they
had
taken
it
into
their
own
hands
and
gone
away
when
it
suddenly
occurred
to
john
however
that
this
perhaps
had
some
share
in
the
ladies
hasty
decision
that
dennistoun
perhaps
all
that
was
objectionable
was
attributed
to
this
poor
lady
had
been
so
abominably
so
odiously
presuming
as
to
have
suspected
this
his
sudden
blaze
of
anger
was
perhaps
she
had
settled
upon
it
for
his
sake
to
take
temptation
out
of
his
way
john
could
scarcely
contain
himself
when
this
view
of
the
case
flashed
upon
him
although
he
was
quite
aware
for
himself
that
though
it
was
a
bitter
wrench
yet
it
was
perhaps
good
for
him
that
elinor
should
go
away
it
was
probably
this
wave
of
fierce
and
as
we
are
aware
quite
unreasonable
anger
rushing
over
him
that
produced
the
change
which
everybody
saw
in
john
life
about
this
time
it
was
about
the
beginning
of
the
season
when
people
enjoyments
begin
to
multiply
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
john
plunged
into
society
like
a
very
novice
he
went
everywhere
by
this
time
he
had
made
a
great
start
in
life
had
been
brought
into
note
in
one
or
two
important
cases
and
was
as
everybody
knew
a
young
man
very
well
thought
of
and
likely
to
do
great
things
at
the
bar
so
that
he
was
free
of
many
houses
and
had
so
many
invitations
for
his
sundays
that
he
could
well
afford
to
be
indifferent
to
the
loss
of
such
a
humble
house
as
the
cottage
at
windyhill
perhaps
he
wanted
to
persuade
himself
that
this
was
the
case
and
that
there
really
was
nothing
to
regret
and
it
is
certain
that
he
did
visit
a
great
deal
during
that
season
at
one
house
where
there
were
two
or
three
agreeable
daughters
the
house
indeed
of
sir
john
gaythorne
who
was
at
that
time
and
a
man
who
had
always
looked
upon
john
tatham
with
a
favourable
eye
the
gaythornes
had
a
house
near
dorking
where
they
often
went
from
saturday
to
monday
with
a
few
choice
and
picknicked
as
they
themselves
said
but
it
was
a
picknicking
of
a
highly
comfortable
sort
john
went
down
with
them
the
very
saturday
after
he
received
that
letter
the
saturday
on
which
he
had
intended
to
go
to
windyhill
and
the
party
was
very
gay
to
compare
it
for
a
moment
with
the
humdrum
family
at
the
cottage
would
have
been
absurd
the
gaythornes
prided
themselves
on
always
having
pleasant
people
with
them
and
they
had
several
remarkably
pleasant
people
that
day
among
whom
john
himself
was
welcomed
by
most
persons
and
the
family
themselves
were
lively
and
agreeable
to
a
high
degree
a
distinguished
father
a
very
nice
mother
and
three
charming
girls
up
to
everything
and
who
knew
everybody
who
had
read
or
skimmed
all
the
new
books
of
any
importance
and
had
seen
all
the
new
pictures
who
could
talk
of
serious
things
as
well
as
they
could
talk
nonsense
and
who
were
good
girls
to
boot
looking
after
the
poor
and
visiting
at
hospitals
in
the
intervals
of
their
gaieties
as
was
then
the
highest
fashion
in
town
i
do
not
for
a
moment
mean
to
imply
that
the
miss
gaythornes
did
their
good
work
because
it
was
the
fashion
but
the
fact
that
it
is
the
fashion
has
liberated
many
girls
and
allowed
them
to
carry
out
their
natural
wishes
in
that
way
who
otherwise
would
have
been
restrained
and
hampered
by
parents
and
friends
who
would
have
upbraided
them
with
making
themselves
remarkable
if
in
a
former
generation
they
had
attempted
to
go
to
whitechapel
or
thomas
with
any
active
intentions
and
elinor
had
never
done
anything
of
this
kind
any
more
than
she
had
pursued
music
almost
as
a
profession
which
was
what
helena
gaythorne
had
done
or
learned
to
draw
like
maud
who
once
had
a
little
thing
in
the
royal
academy
or
studied
the
classics
like
gertrude
john
thought
of
her
little
tunes
as
he
listened
to
miss
gaythorne
performance
and
almost
laughed
out
at
the
comparison
he
was
very
fond
of
music
and
miss
gaythorne
playing
was
something
which
the
most
cultivated
audience
might
have
been
glad
to
listen
to
he
was
ashamed
to
confess
to
himself
that
he
liked
the
tunes
best
no
he
would
not
confess
it
even
to
himself
but
when
he
stood
behind
the
performer
listening
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
was
capable
of
walking
all
the
miles
of
hill
and
hollow
which
divided
the
one
place
from
the
other
only
for
the
inane
satisfaction
of
seeing
that
baby
spread
on
elinor
lap
or
hearing
her
play
to
him
one
of
her
tunes
he
went
with
the
gaythornes
to
their
twice
in
the
month
of
june
and
dined
at
the
house
several
times
and
was
invited
on
other
occasions
becoming
in
short
one
of
the
when
there
was
anything
going
on
in
the
house
till
people
began
to
ask
which
was
it
it
was
thought
generally
that
helena
was
the
attraction
for
john
was
known
to
be
a
musical
man
always
to
be
found
where
specially
good
music
was
going
some
friends
of
the
family
had
even
gone
so
far
as
to
say
among
themselves
what
a
good
thing
it
was
that
dear
helena
lot
was
likely
to
be
cast
with
one
who
would
appreciate
her
gift
it
generally
happens
in
these
cases
that
a
girl
marries
somebody
who
does
not
know
one
note
from
another
they
said
to
each
other
when
all
at
once
john
flagged
in
his
visits
went
no
more
to
dorking
and
finally
ceased
to
be
more
assiduous
or
more
remarked
than
the
other
young
men
who
were
on
terms
of
partial
intimacy
at
the
gaythorne
house
he
had
indeed
tried
very
hard
to
make
himself
fall
in
love
with
one
of
sir
john
girls
it
would
have
been
an
excellent
connection
and
the
man
might
think
himself
fortunate
who
secured
any
one
of
the
three
for
his
wife
proceeding
from
his
certainty
on
these
points
and
also
a
general
liking
for
their
company
john
had
gone
into
it
with
a
settled
purpose
determined
to
fall
in
love
if
he
could
but
he
found
that
the
thing
was
not
to
be
done
it
was
a
pity
but
it
could
not
be
helped
he
was
in
a
condition
now
when
it
would
no
longer
be
rash
to
marry
and
he
knew
now
that
there
was
the
makings
of
a
domestic
man
in
him
he
never
could
have
believed
that
he
would
take
an
interest
in
the
sprawling
of
the
baby
upon
its
mother
knee
and
he
allowed
to
himself
that
it
might
be
sweet
to
have
that
scene
taking
place
in
a
house
of
his
own
ah
but
the
baby
would
have
to
be
elinor
it
must
be
elinor
who
should
sit
on
that
low
chair
with
the
firelight
on
her
face
and
that
was
impossible
helena
gaythorne
was
an
exceedingly
nice
girl
and
he
wished
her
every
success
in
life
which
she
attained
some
time
after
by
marrying
lord
ballinasloe
the
eldest
son
of
the
earl
of
athenree
a
marriage
which
everybody
approved
but
he
could
not
persuade
himself
to
be
in
love
with
her
though
with
the
best
will
in
the
world
during
this
time
he
did
not
correspond
much
with
his
relations
in
the
country
he
had
indeed
some
letters
to
answer
from
his
father
in
which
the
interrogatories
were
very
difficult
where
has
mary
dennistoun
gone
what
become
of
elinor
and
her
baby
has
that
fashionable
fellow
of
a
husband
deserted
her
what
the
meaning
of
the
move
altogether
and
mind
you
keep
yourself
out
of
it
his
father
wrote
john
had
great
trouble
in
wording
his
replies
so
as
to
convey
as
little
information
as
possible
i
believe
aunt
mary
has
got
a
house
somewhere
in
the
north
probably
to
suit
elinor
who
would
be
able
to
be
more
with
her
if
she
were
in
that
neighbourhood
it
must
be
confessed
that
he
thought
this
really
clever
as
a
way
of
getting
over
the
question
as
for
compton
i
know
very
little
about
him
he
was
never
a
man
much
in
my
way
tatham
household
saw
nothing
remarkable
in
these
replies
upon
which
however
they
built
an
explanation
such
as
it
was
of
the
other
circumstances
they
concluded
that
it
must
be
in
order
to
be
near
elinor
that
dennistoun
had
gone
to
the
north
and
that
it
was
a
very
good
thing
that
elinor
husband
was
not
a
man
who
was
in
john
way
a
scamp
if
i
ever
saw
one
tatham
said
but
that
jack
says
about
gaythorne
mary
i
remember
gaythorne
years
ago
a
capital
friend
for
a
young
man
i
glad
your
brother
making
such
nice
friends
for
himself
far
better
than
mooning
about
that
wretched
little
cottage
with
mary
dennistoun
and
her
girl
chapter
xxx
it
happened
thus
that
it
was
not
till
the
second
autumn
after
the
settlement
of
the
ladies
in
waterdale
when
all
the
questions
had
died
out
and
there
was
no
more
talk
of
them
except
on
occasions
when
a
sudden
recollection
cropped
up
among
their
friends
at
windyhill
that
john
tatham
paid
them
his
first
visit
he
had
been
very
conscientious
in
his
proposed
bestowal
of
himself
perhaps
it
is
scarcely
quite
complimentary
to
a
woman
when
she
is
made
choice
of
by
a
man
who
is
consciously
to
himself
on
the
outlook
thinking
that
he
ought
to
marry
and
investigating
all
the
suitable
persons
about
with
an
eye
to
finding
one
who
will
answer
his
requirements
this
sensible
way
of
approaching
the
subject
of
matrimony
does
not
somehow
commend
itself
to
our
insular
notions
it
is
the
right
way
in
every
country
except
our
own
but
it
has
a
look
to
the
and
a
girl
is
not
flattered
though
perhaps
she
ought
to
be
by
being
the
subject
of
this
sensible
choice
as
if
i
were
a
housekeeper
or
a
cook
she
is
apt
to
say
and
is
far
better
pleased
to
be
fallen
in
love
with
in
the
most
rash
and
irresponsible
way
than
to
be
thus
selected
from
the
crowd
though
that
everybody
must
allow
after
due
comparison
and
inspection
is
by
far
the
greater
compliment
john
having
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
it
would
be
better
for
him
in
many
ways
to
marry
and
specially
in
the
way
of
elinor
fortifying
him
for
ever
from
all
possible
complications
and
making
it
possible
for
him
to
regard
her
evermore
with
the
placid
feelings
of
a
brother
which
was
he
expected
to
be
the
consequence
worked
at
the
matter
really
with
great
pertinacity
and
consistency
he
kept
his
eyes
open
upon
the
whole
generation
of
girls
whom
he
met
with
in
society
when
he
went
abroad
during
the
long
vacation
instead
of
going
to
lakeside
as
he
was
invited
to
do
he
directed
his
steps
rather
to
the
fashionable
resorts
where
families
disport
themselves
at
the
foot
of
the
mountains
than
to
the
alpine
heights
where
he
had
generally
found
a
more
robust
amusement
and
wherever
he
went
he
bent
his
attention
on
the
fairer
portion
of
the
creation
the
girls
who
fill
all
the
hotels
with
the
flutter
of
their
fresh
toilettes
and
the
babble
of
their
pleasant
voices
it
was
very
mean
and
poor
of
him
seeing
he
was
a
mountaineer
himself
but
still
it
must
be
recorded
that
the
only
young
ladies
he
systematically
neglected
were
those
in
very
short
petticoats
with
very
sunburnt
faces
and
nails
in
their
boots
who
ought
to
have
been
most
congenial
to
him
as
sharing
his
own
tastes
it
is
said
i
do
know
with
what
truth
that
at
ouch
or
interlachen
or
some
other
of
the
most
mundane
and
banal
resorts
of
the
tourists
he
came
upon
one
girl
who
he
thought
might
make
him
a
suitable
wife
and
that
though
with
much
moderation
and
prudence
he
more
or
less
followed
her
party
for
some
time
meeting
them
over
and
over
again
with
expressions
of
astonishment
round
the
most
corners
and
persisting
for
a
considerable
time
in
this
quest
but
whether
he
ever
came
the
length
of
proposing
at
all
or
whether
the
young
lady
was
engaged
beforehand
or
if
she
thought
the
prospect
of
making
a
suitable
wife
not
good
enough
i
can
not
say
and
i
doubt
whether
any
one
knows
except
of
course
the
parties
immediately
concerned
it
is
very
clear
at
all
events
that
it
came
to
nothing
john
did
not
altogether
give
it
up
i
fancy
for
he
went
a
great
deal
into
society
still
especially
in
that
which
people
who
live
in
london
declare
to
be
the
most
enjoyable
and
when
it
is
supposed
you
can
enjoy
the
best
of
company
at
your
ease
without
the
hurry
and
rush
of
the
summer
crowd
he
would
have
been
very
glad
thankful
indeed
if
he
could
have
fallen
in
love
how
absurd
to
think
that
any
silly
boy
can
do
it
to
whom
it
is
probably
nothing
but
a
disadvantage
and
the
silliest
of
pastimes
and
that
he
a
reasonable
man
with
a
good
income
and
arrived
at
a
time
of
life
when
it
is
becoming
and
rational
to
marry
could
not
do
it
let
him
try
as
he
would
there
was
something
ludicrous
in
it
when
you
came
to
think
as
well
as
something
very
depressing
mothers
who
wanted
a
good
position
for
their
daughters
divined
him
and
many
of
them
were
exceedingly
civil
to
john
this
man
in
search
of
a
wife
and
many
of
the
young
ladies
themselves
divined
him
and
with
the
half
indignation
half
mockery
appropriate
to
the
situation
were
some
of
them
not
unaverse
to
profit
by
it
and
accordingly
turned
to
him
their
worst
side
in
the
produced
by
that
knowledge
and
thus
the
second
year
turned
round
towards
the
wane
and
john
was
farther
from
success
than
ever
he
said
to
himself
then
that
it
was
clear
he
was
not
a
marrying
man
he
liked
the
society
of
ladies
well
enough
but
not
in
that
way
he
was
not
made
for
falling
in
love
he
might
very
well
he
was
aware
have
dispensed
with
the
tradition
and
found
an
excellent
wife
who
would
not
at
all
have
insisted
upon
it
from
her
side
but
he
had
his
prejudices
and
could
not
do
this
love
he
insisted
upon
and
love
would
not
come
accordingly
when
the
second
season
was
over
he
gave
up
both
the
quest
and
the
idea
and
resolved
to
think
of
marrying
no
more
which
was
a
sensible
relief
to
him
for
indeed
he
was
exceedingly
comfortable
as
he
was
his
chambers
were
excellent
and
he
did
not
think
that
any
street
or
square
in
belgravia
would
have
reconciled
him
to
giving
up
the
temple
he
had
excellent
servants
a
man
and
his
wife
who
took
the
greatest
care
of
him
he
had
settled
into
a
life
which
was
arranged
as
he
liked
with
much
freedom
and
yet
an
agreeable
routine
which
john
was
too
wise
to
despise
he
relinquished
the
idea
of
marrying
then
and
there
to
be
sure
there
is
never
any
prophesying
what
may
happen
a
little
laughing
gipsy
of
a
girl
may
banish
such
a
resolution
out
of
a
man
mind
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
at
any
moment
but
short
of
such
accidents
as
that
and
he
smiled
at
the
idea
of
anything
of
the
kind
he
quite
made
up
his
mind
on
this
point
with
a
great
sensation
of
relief
it
is
curious
how
determined
the
mind
of
the
english
public
at
least
is
on
this
subject
that
the
man
or
woman
who
does
not
marry
especially
the
woman
has
an
unhappy
life
and
that
a
story
which
does
not
end
in
a
wedding
is
no
story
at
all
or
at
least
ends
badly
as
people
say
it
happened
to
myself
on
one
occasion
to
put
together
in
a
book
the
story
of
some
friends
of
mine
in
which
this
was
the
case
they
were
young
they
were
hopeful
they
had
all
life
before
them
but
they
did
not
marry
and
when
the
last
chapter
came
to
the
consciousness
of
the
publisher
he
struck
with
the
courage
of
a
true
briton
not
ashamed
of
his
principles
and
refused
to
pay
he
said
it
was
no
story
at
all
so
beautiful
is
marriage
in
the
eyes
of
our
countrymen
i
hope
however
that
nobody
will
think
any
harm
of
john
tatham
because
he
concluded
after
considerable
and
patient
trial
that
he
was
not
a
marrying
man
there
is
no
harm
in
that
a
great
number
of
those
catholic
priests
whom
it
was
the
habit
in
my
youth
to
commiserate
deeply
as
if
they
were
vowed
to
the
worst
martyrdom
live
very
happy
lives
in
their
celibacy
and
prefer
it
as
john
tatham
did
it
will
be
apparent
to
the
reader
that
he
really
preferred
it
to
elinor
while
elinor
was
in
his
power
and
though
afterwards
it
gave
a
comfort
and
grace
to
his
life
to
think
that
it
was
his
faithful
but
subdued
love
for
elinor
which
made
him
a
bachelor
all
his
days
i
am
by
no
means
certain
that
this
was
true
perhaps
he
never
would
have
made
up
his
mind
had
she
remained
always
within
his
reach
certain
it
is
that
he
was
relieved
when
he
found
that
to
give
up
the
idea
of
marriage
was
the
best
thing
for
him
he
adopted
the
conclusion
with
pleasure
his
next
brother
had
already
married
though
he
was
younger
than
john
but
then
he
was
a
clergyman
which
is
a
profession
naturally
tending
to
that
sort
of
thing
there
was
however
no
kind
of
necessity
laid
upon
him
to
provide
for
the
continuance
of
the
race
and
he
was
a
happy
man
by
what
sequence
of
ideas
it
was
that
he
considered
himself
justified
having
come
to
this
conclusion
in
immediately
paying
his
visit
to
lakeside
is
a
question
which
i
need
not
enter
into
and
indeed
do
not
feel
entirely
able
to
cope
with
it
suited
him
perhaps
as
he
had
been
so
long
a
time
in
switzerland
last
year
and
he
had
an
invitation
to
the
far
north
for
the
grouse
which
he
thought
it
would
be
pleasant
to
accept
going
to
scotland
or
coming
from
it
waterdale
of
course
lies
full
in
the
way
he
took
it
last
on
his
way
home
which
was
more
convenient
and
arrived
there
in
the
latter
part
of
september
when
the
hills
were
golden
with
the
yellow
bracken
the
cumberland
hills
are
a
little
cold
in
my
opinion
without
the
heather
which
clothes
with
such
a
flush
of
life
and
brightness
our
hills
in
the
north
the
greenness
is
chilly
in
the
frequent
rain
one
feels
how
sodden
and
slippery
it
is
a
moisture
which
does
not
belong
to
the
heather
but
when
the
brackens
have
all
turned
and
the
slopes
reflect
themselves
in
the
tranquil
water
like
hills
of
gold
then
the
landscape
reaches
its
perfect
point
lakeside
was
a
white
house
standing
out
on
a
small
projection
at
the
head
of
the
lake
commanding
the
group
of
hills
above
and
part
of
the
winding
body
of
water
below
in
which
all
these
golden
reflections
lay
a
little
steamer
passed
across
the
reflected
glory
and
came
to
a
stop
not
a
hundred
yards
from
the
gate
of
the
house
it
was
a
scene
as
unlike
as
could
be
conceived
to
the
cottage
at
windyhill
the
trees
were
all
glorious
in
colour
yellow
birches
like
trees
made
of
light
oaks
all
red
and
fiery
chestnuts
and
elms
and
beeches
in
a
hundred
hues
the
house
was
white
with
a
sort
of
broad
verandah
round
supported
on
pillars
furnishing
a
sheltered
walk
below
and
a
broad
balcony
above
which
gave
it
a
character
of
more
importance
than
perhaps
its
real
size
warranted
when
john
approached
there
ran
out
to
meet
him
into
the
wide
gravel
drive
before
the
door
a
little
figure
upon
two
sturdy
legs
calling
out
in
inarticulate
shoutings
something
that
sounded
a
little
like
his
own
name
it
was
john
john
made
into
a
sort
of
song
by
the
baby
nearly
two
years
old
and
very
forward
as
everybody
assured
the
stranger
for
his
age
uncle
john
his
place
was
thus
determined
at
once
by
that
little
potentate
and
master
of
the
house
behind
the
child
came
elinor
no
longer
pale
and
languid
as
he
had
seen
her
last
but
matured
into
vigorous
beauty
a
little
sober
as
might
have
become
maturer
years
than
hers
perhaps
there
was
something
in
the
style
of
her
dress
that
favoured
the
idea
not
of
age
indeed
but
of
matronly
years
and
beyond
those
which
elinor
counted
she
was
dressed
in
black
of
the
simplest
description
not
of
distinctive
character
like
a
widow
yet
something
like
what
an
ideal
widow
beyond
fashion
or
conventionalities
of
woe
might
wear
it
seemed
to
give
john
the
of
the
character
she
had
assumed
in
this
new
sphere
dennistoun
who
had
not
changed
in
the
least
stood
in
the
open
door
they
gave
him
a
welcome
such
as
john
had
not
had
he
said
to
himself
since
he
had
seen
them
before
they
were
unfeignedly
glad
to
see
him
not
wounded
which
to
think
of
afterwards
wounded
him
a
little
that
he
had
not
come
sooner
but
delighted
that
he
was
here
now
even
when
he
went
home
it
was
not
usual
to
john
to
be
met
at
the
door
in
this
way
by
all
his
belongings
his
sister
might
come
running
down
the
stairs
when
she
heard
the
draw
up
but
that
was
all
and
eagerness
to
see
him
was
generally
tempered
by
the
advice
she
had
to
give
to
say
that
or
not
to
say
this
because
of
papa
but
in
the
present
case
it
was
the
sight
of
himself
which
was
delightful
to
all
and
above
all
though
the
child
could
have
no
reason
for
it
to
the
little
shouting
excited
boy
john
john
what
was
uncle
john
to
him
yet
his
little
voice
filled
the
room
with
shouts
of
joy
what
does
he
know
about
me
the
little
beggar
that
he
makes
such
a
noise
in
my
honour
said
john
touched
in
spite
of
himself
but
i
suppose
anything
is
good
enough
for
a
cry
at
that
age
come
said
elinor
you
are
not
to
be
contemptuous
of
my
boy
any
longer
you
called
him
when
he
was
a
baby
and
what
is
he
now
said
john
whose
heart
was
affected
by
strange
emotions
he
the
man
who
had
just
decided
with
relief
that
he
was
not
a
marrying
man
there
came
over
him
a
curious
wave
of
sensation
which
he
had
no
right
to
if
he
had
had
a
right
to
it
if
he
had
been
coming
home
to
those
who
belonged
to
him
not
distantly
in
the
way
of
cousinship
but
by
a
dearer
right
what
sensations
his
would
have
been
but
sitting
at
the
corner
of
the
fire
which
is
very
necessary
in
waterdale
in
the
end
of
september
a
little
in
the
shadow
his
face
was
not
very
clearly
perceptible
though
indeed
had
it
been
so
the
ladies
would
have
thought
nothing
but
that
john
kind
heart
was
touched
as
was
so
natural
by
this
sight
what
is
he
now
your
nephew
tell
uncle
john
what
you
are
now
said
elinor
lifting
her
child
on
her
lap
at
which
the
child
between
the
kisses
which
were
his
encouragement
and
reward
produced
in
a
large
infant
voice
very
treble
yet
simulating
hers
the
statement
bhoy
now
elinor
said
dennistoun
he
has
played
his
part
beautifully
he
has
done
everything
you
taught
him
he
has
told
you
who
he
is
and
who
uncle
john
is
let
him
go
to
his
nursery
now
come
pippo
mother
will
carry
her
boy
said
elinor
they
do
want
us
any
more
these
old
people
say
to
uncle
john
and
come
to
bed
john
said
the
child
which
however
was
not
enough
for
he
tilted
himself
out
of
his
mother
arms
and
put
his
rosy
face
and
open
mouth
sweet
but
damp
upon
john
face
this
kiss
was
one
of
the
child
accomplishments
he
himself
was
aware
that
he
had
been
good
and
behaved
himself
in
every
way
as
a
child
should
do
as
he
was
carried
off
crowing
and
jabbering
in
his
mother
arms
he
had
formed
a
sort
of
little
human
bridge
between
them
when
he
made
that
dive
from
arms
upon
john
face
ah
heaven
if
it
had
been
the
other
way
if
the
child
and
the
mother
had
both
been
his
he
has
grown
up
very
sweet
you
may
think
we
are
foolish
john
but
you
ca
imagine
what
a
delight
that
child
is
has
he
grown
up
sweet
if
you
call
that
grown
up
oh
yes
i
know
he
is
only
a
baby
still
but
so
forward
for
his
age
such
a
little
man
taking
care
of
his
mother
before
he
is
two
years
old
what
did
i
hear
her
call
him
john
asked
and
it
seemed
to
dennistoun
that
there
was
something
severe
in
the
sound
of
his
voice
he
had
to
be
philip
it
is
a
pretty
name
though
we
may
have
reason
to
mourn
the
day
and
belongs
to
his
family
we
must
not
forget
that
he
belongs
to
a
known
family
however
he
may
have
suffered
by
it
then
you
intend
the
child
to
know
about
his
family
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
said
john
though
his
voice
perhaps
was
not
so
sweet
as
his
words
oh
john
that
is
quite
another
thing
to
know
about
his
family
at
two
he
has
his
mother
and
me
to
take
care
of
them
both
and
what
does
he
want
more
but
he
will
not
always
be
two
said
john
the
first
moment
almost
of
his
arrival
before
he
had
seen
the
house
or
said
a
word
about
the
lake
or
anything
she
was
so
disappointed
and
cast
down
that
she
made
him
no
reply
i
am
a
wretched
croaker
he
said
after
a
moment
i
know
i
ought
after
all
this
time
to
try
to
make
myself
more
agreeable
but
you
must
pardon
me
if
this
was
the
first
thing
that
came
into
my
mind
elinor
is
looking
a
great
deal
better
than
when
i
saw
her
last
is
she
another
creature
i
do
say
that
i
am
satisfied
john
who
would
be
satisfied
in
such
a
position
of
affairs
but
while
the
child
is
so
very
young
nothing
matters
very
much
and
she
is
quite
happy
i
do
think
she
is
quite
happy
and
so
well
this
country
suits
them
both
perfectly
though
there
is
a
good
deal
of
rain
they
are
both
out
every
day
and
little
pippo
thrives
as
you
see
like
a
flower
that
is
a
very
fantastic
name
to
give
the
child
how
critical
you
are
john
perhaps
it
is
but
what
does
it
matter
at
his
age
any
name
does
for
a
baby
why
you
yourself
as
grave
as
you
are
now
do
aunt
said
john
it
is
a
grave
matter
enough
as
it
appears
to
me
not
for
the
present
not
for
the
present
john
perhaps
not
for
the
present
if
you
prefer
to
put
off
all
the
difficulties
till
they
grow
up
and
crush
you
have
there
been
any
overtures
all
this
time
from
the
other
side
dear
john
do
overwhelm
me
all
in
a
moment
in
the
first
pleasure
of
seeing
you
both
with
the
troubles
that
are
behind
and
the
troubles
that
are
in
front
of
us
the
poor
lady
said
chapter
xxxi
the
weather
was
fine
which
was
by
no
means
always
a
certainty
at
waterdale
and
elinor
had
become
a
great
pedestrian
and
was
ready
to
accompany
john
in
his
walks
which
were
long
and
varied
it
was
rather
a
curious
test
to
which
to
subject
himself
after
the
long
time
he
had
been
away
and
the
other
tests
through
which
he
had
gone
never
had
he
been
so
entirely
the
companion
of
elinor
never
before
had
they
spent
so
many
hours
together
without
other
society
at
windyhill
indeed
their
interviews
had
been
quite
unrestrained
but
then
elinor
had
many
friends
and
interests
in
the
parish
and
outside
of
it
visits
to
pay
and
duties
to
perform
now
she
had
her
child
which
occupied
her
mornings
and
evenings
but
left
her
free
for
hours
of
rambling
among
the
hills
for
long
walks
from
which
she
came
back
blooming
with
the
fresh
air
and
breezes
which
had
blown
her
about
ruffling
her
hair
and
stirring
up
her
spirits
and
thoughts
sometimes
when
there
has
been
heavy
and
premature
suffering
there
occurs
thus
in
the
young
another
an
almost
childhood
of
natural
it
may
be
said
superficial
pleasure
the
power
of
being
amused
and
of
enjoying
every
simple
satisfaction
without
any
like
a
child
she
had
recovered
her
strength
and
vigour
in
the
mountain
air
and
in
that
freedom
of
being
unknown
with
no
look
ever
directed
to
her
which
reminded
her
of
the
past
no
question
which
brought
back
her
troubles
had
blossomed
out
into
that
fine
youthful
maturity
of
which
has
already
an
advantage
over
the
earlier
girlhood
the
perfection
of
the
woman
grown
elinor
had
thought
of
many
things
and
understood
many
things
which
she
had
still
regarded
with
the
high
assumptions
of
ignorance
three
or
four
years
ago
and
poor
john
who
had
tried
so
hard
to
find
himself
a
mate
that
suited
him
who
had
studied
so
many
girls
more
beautiful
more
accomplished
than
elinor
in
the
hope
of
goading
himself
so
to
speak
into
love
and
had
not
succeeded
and
who
had
felt
so
strongly
that
another
man
wife
must
not
occupy
so
much
of
his
thoughts
nor
another
man
child
give
him
an
unwilling
pleasure
which
was
almost
fatherly
poor
john
felt
himself
placed
in
a
position
more
trying
than
any
he
had
known
before
more
difficult
to
steer
his
way
through
he
had
never
had
so
much
of
her
company
and
she
did
not
conceal
the
pleasure
it
was
to
her
to
have
some
one
to
walk
with
to
talk
with
who
understood
what
she
said
and
what
she
did
not
say
and
was
in
that
unpurchasable
sympathy
with
herself
which
is
not
to
be
got
by
beauty
or
by
will
or
even
by
love
itself
but
comes
by
nature
elinor
felt
this
with
simple
pleasure
without
any
complicating
suspicion
she
said
what
a
brother
john
is
i
always
felt
him
so
but
now
more
than
ever
you
have
been
so
to
speak
brought
up
together
said
dennistoun
whose
mind
was
by
no
means
so
easy
on
the
subject
that
is
the
reason
i
suppose
said
elinor
with
happy
looks
but
poor
john
said
nothing
of
this
kind
what
he
felt
was
that
he
might
have
spared
himself
the
trouble
of
all
those
researches
of
his
that
to
roam
about
looking
for
a
young
lady
whom
he
might
not
devour
but
learn
to
love
was
pains
as
unnecessary
as
ever
man
took
he
still
hugged
himself
however
over
the
thought
that
in
no
circumstances
would
he
have
been
a
marrying
man
that
if
elinor
had
been
free
he
would
have
found
plenty
of
reasons
why
they
should
remain
on
their
present
terms
and
go
no
farther
as
it
was
clear
that
they
must
remain
on
their
present
terms
and
could
go
no
farther
it
was
certainly
better
that
he
should
cherish
that
thought
and
curiously
enough
though
they
heard
so
little
from
the
outside
world
they
had
heard
just
so
much
as
this
that
john
assiduities
to
the
miss
gaythornes
which
the
reader
may
remember
was
the
first
of
all
his
attempts
and
quite
antiquated
in
his
recollection
had
occasioned
remarks
and
he
had
not
been
many
evenings
at
lakeside
before
he
was
questioned
on
the
subject
had
it
been
true
or
had
he
changed
his
mind
or
had
the
lady
it
vexed
him
that
there
was
not
the
least
little
opposition
or
despite
in
their
tones
such
as
a
man
female
friends
often
show
towards
the
objects
of
his
admiration
not
from
any
feeling
on
their
own
part
except
that
most
natural
one
which
is
surprised
and
almost
hurt
to
find
that
having
known
me
he
could
decline
a
feeling
which
in
its
original
expression
was
not
a
woman
sentiment
but
a
man
and
therefore
is
i
suppose
common
to
both
sides
but
the
ladies
at
lakeside
did
not
even
betray
this
feeling
they
desired
to
know
if
there
had
been
anything
in
it
with
smiles
it
is
true
but
dennistoun
at
the
same
time
expressed
her
regret
warmly
we
were
in
great
hopes
something
would
come
of
it
john
elinor
has
met
the
gaythornes
and
thought
them
very
nice
and
if
there
is
a
thing
in
the
world
that
would
give
me
pleasure
it
would
be
to
see
you
with
a
nice
wife
john
i
am
sure
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
aunt
but
there
really
was
nothing
in
it
that
is
i
was
seized
with
various
impulses
on
the
subject
and
rather
agreed
with
you
but
i
never
mentioned
the
matter
to
any
of
the
miss
gaythornes
they
are
charming
girls
and
i
do
suppose
would
have
looked
at
me
at
the
same
time
i
did
not
feel
it
possible
to
imagine
myself
in
love
with
any
of
them
that
quite
a
long
time
since
he
added
with
a
laugh
then
there
have
been
others
since
then
let
us
put
him
in
the
confessional
mother
cried
elinor
with
a
laugh
he
ought
not
to
have
any
secrets
of
that
description
from
you
and
me
oh
yes
there
have
been
others
since
said
john
to
tell
the
truth
i
have
walked
round
a
great
many
nice
girls
asking
myself
whether
i
should
find
it
very
delightful
to
have
one
of
them
belonging
to
me
i
was
worthy
the
least
attractive
of
them
all
i
quite
knew
but
still
i
am
about
the
same
as
other
men
however
as
i
said
i
never
mentioned
the
matter
to
any
of
them
never
cried
dennistoun
feeling
a
hesitation
in
his
tone
he
laughed
a
little
shamefaced
well
if
you
like
i
will
say
hardly
ever
he
said
there
was
one
that
might
perhaps
have
taken
pity
upon
me
but
fortunately
an
old
lover
of
hers
who
was
much
more
enterprising
turned
up
before
anything
decisive
had
been
said
fortunately
john
well
yes
i
thought
so
you
see
i
am
not
a
marrying
man
i
tried
to
screw
myself
up
to
the
point
but
it
was
altogether
i
am
afraid
as
a
matter
of
principle
i
thought
it
would
be
a
good
thing
perhaps
to
have
a
wife
that
was
a
very
idea
no
wonder
you
it
never
came
to
anything
that
is
not
the
way
to
go
about
it
said
elinor
with
the
ringing
laugh
of
a
child
and
yet
her
way
of
going
about
it
had
been
far
from
a
success
how
curious
that
she
did
not
remember
that
yes
he
said
i
am
quite
aware
that
i
did
not
go
about
it
in
the
right
way
but
then
that
was
the
only
way
in
which
it
presented
itself
to
me
and
when
i
had
made
up
my
mind
at
last
that
it
was
a
failure
i
confess
it
was
with
a
certain
sense
of
relief
i
suppose
i
was
born
to
live
and
die
an
old
bachelor
do
not
be
so
sure
of
that
said
elinor
some
day
or
other
in
the
most
moment
the
fairy
princess
will
bound
upon
the
scene
and
the
old
bachelor
will
be
lost
we
wait
quite
contentedly
for
that
day
which
i
do
believe
in
he
said
dennistoun
did
not
take
any
part
in
the
later
portion
of
this
discussion
her
smile
was
feeble
at
the
places
where
elinor
laughed
she
said
seriously
after
this
fireside
conference
when
he
got
up
to
prepare
for
dinner
putting
her
hand
tenderly
on
his
shoulder
i
wish
you
had
found
some
one
you
could
have
loved
john
so
did
i
for
a
time
he
said
lightly
but
you
see
it
was
not
to
be
she
shook
her
head
standing
against
the
firelight
in
the
dark
room
so
that
he
could
not
see
her
face
i
wish
she
said
i
wish
that
i
saw
you
with
a
nice
wife
john
you
might
wish
to
see
me
on
the
woolsack
aunt
well
and
it
might
come
to
pass
i
shall
see
you
high
up
if
i
live
long
enough
but
i
wish
i
was
as
sure
of
the
other
john
well
he
said
with
a
laugh
i
did
my
best
but
there
is
no
use
in
struggling
against
fate
no
indeed
how
very
very
little
use
there
was
he
had
kept
away
from
them
for
nearly
two
years
while
he
had
done
his
best
in
the
meantime
to
get
a
permanent
tenant
for
his
heart
which
should
prevent
any
wandering
tendencies
but
he
had
not
succeeded
and
now
if
ever
a
man
could
be
put
in
circumstances
of
danger
it
was
he
if
he
did
not
appear
in
time
for
their
walk
elinor
would
call
him
are
you
coming
john
and
she
overflowed
in
talk
to
him
of
everything
excepting
always
of
that
one
dark
passage
in
her
life
of
which
she
never
breathed
a
word
she
asked
him
about
his
work
and
about
his
prospects
insisting
upon
having
everything
explained
to
her
even
politics
to
which
he
had
a
tendency
not
without
ideas
of
their
use
in
reaching
the
higher
ranks
of
his
profession
elinor
entered
into
all
with
zest
and
almost
enthusiasm
she
wrapped
him
up
in
her
sympathy
and
interest
there
was
nothing
he
did
that
she
did
not
wish
to
know
about
did
not
desire
to
have
a
part
in
a
sister
in
this
respect
is
as
everybody
knows
often
more
full
of
enthusiasm
than
a
wife
and
elinor
who
was
vacant
of
all
concerns
of
her
own
except
the
baby
was
delighted
to
take
up
these
subjects
of
excitement
and
follow
john
through
them
hastening
after
him
on
every
line
of
indication
or
suggestion
which
he
gave
nay
often
with
her
lively
intelligence
hastening
before
him
making
incursions
into
undiscovered
countries
of
which
he
had
not
yet
perceived
the
importance
they
walked
over
all
the
country
into
woods
which
were
a
little
damp
and
up
where
the
scramble
was
often
difficult
enough
and
along
the
side
of
the
lake
or
for
a
variety
went
rowing
across
to
the
other
side
or
far
down
the
gleaming
water
out
of
sight
round
the
wooded
corner
which
with
all
its
autumnal
colours
blazed
like
a
brilliant
sentinel
into
the
air
above
and
the
water
below
dennistoun
watched
them
sometimes
with
a
little
trouble
on
her
face
she
would
not
say
a
word
to
throw
suspicions
or
doubts
between
them
she
would
not
awaken
in
elinor
mind
the
thought
that
any
such
possibilities
as
arise
between
two
young
people
free
of
all
bonds
could
be
imagined
as
affecting
her
and
any
man
such
as
her
cousin
john
poor
john
if
he
must
be
the
victim
the
victim
he
must
be
elinor
could
not
be
disturbed
that
he
might
go
free
and
indeed
what
good
would
it
have
done
to
disturb
elinor
it
would
but
have
brought
consciousness
embarrassment
and
a
sense
of
danger
where
no
such
sense
was
she
was
trebly
protected
and
without
a
thought
of
anything
but
the
calm
yet
close
relations
that
had
existed
so
long
he
but
he
could
take
care
of
himself
dennistoun
reflected
in
despair
he
must
take
care
of
himself
he
was
a
man
and
must
understand
what
his
own
risks
and
perils
were
and
do
you
think
this
plan
is
a
success
john
asked
her
one
day
as
they
were
rowing
homeward
up
the
lake
the
time
of
his
visit
was
drawing
to
a
close
indeed
it
had
drawn
to
a
close
several
times
and
been
lengthened
very
unadvisedly
yet
very
irresistibly
as
he
felt
her
face
grew
graver
than
usual
as
with
a
sudden
recollection
of
that
shadow
upon
her
life
which
elinor
so
often
seemed
to
have
forgotten
as
much
of
a
success
she
said
as
anything
of
the
kind
is
likely
to
be
it
suits
you
better
than
windyhill
only
in
being
more
out
of
the
world
it
is
partially
out
of
the
world
for
a
great
part
of
the
year
but
i
suppose
no
place
is
so
wholly
it
seems
impossible
to
keep
from
making
acquaintances
of
course
he
said
i
have
noticed
you
know
people
here
already
how
can
we
keep
from
knowing
people
mamma
says
it
is
the
same
thing
everywhere
if
we
lived
up
in
that
little
house
which
they
say
is
the
highest
in
england
at
the
head
of
the
pass
we
should
meet
people
i
suppose
even
there
most
likely
he
replied
but
the
same
difficulties
can
hardly
arise
you
mean
we
shall
not
know
people
so
well
as
at
at
home
and
will
not
be
compelled
to
give
an
account
of
ourselves
whatever
we
do
heaven
knows
there
is
a
vicarage
here
and
there
is
a
squire
house
and
there
are
two
or
three
people
besides
who
already
begin
to
inquire
if
we
are
related
to
if
we
are
the
scotch
dennistouns
or
the
irish
comptons
or
i
do
know
what
and
whether
we
are
going
to
penrith
or
any
other
capital
city
for
the
winter
elinor
ended
with
a
laugh
so
soon
john
said
so
soon
very
much
sooner
the
first
year
with
mamma
so
friendly
as
she
is
and
with
me
so
silly
unable
to
keep
myself
from
smiling
at
anybody
who
smiles
at
me
poor
elinor
oh
you
may
laugh
but
it
is
a
real
disadvantage
i
am
sure
there
was
not
very
much
smile
in
me
when
we
came
and
yet
notwithstanding
the
first
pleasant
look
is
enough
for
me
i
can
not
but
respond
and
i
shall
always
be
so
i
suppose
she
said
with
a
sigh
i
hope
so
elinor
it
would
be
an
evil
day
for
all
of
us
if
you
did
not
respond
for
how
many
john
for
my
mother
and
ah
you
are
so
good
more
like
my
brother
than
my
cousin
for
you
perhaps
a
little
but
what
is
it
to
anybody
else
in
the
world
whether
i
smile
or
sigh
it
does
not
matter
however
she
said
flinging
back
her
head
there
it
is
and
i
help
it
if
you
smile
at
me
i
must
smile
back
again
and
so
we
make
friends
and
already
i
get
a
great
deal
of
advice
about
little
pippo
if
we
live
here
till
he
grows
up
the
same
thing
will
happen
as
at
the
cottage
we
will
require
to
account
to
everybody
for
what
we
do
with
him
for
the
school
he
goes
to
and
all
he
does
to
explain
why
he
has
one
kind
of
training
or
another
and
in
short
all
that
i
ran
away
from
the
world
wherever
one
goes
seems
to
be
so
much
the
same
the
world
is
very
much
the
same
everywhere
and
you
can
not
get
out
of
it
were
you
to
take
refuge
in
a
cave
on
the
hill
the
best
thing
is
generally
to
let
it
know
all
that
can
be
known
and
so
save
the
multitude
of
guesses
it
always
makes
elinor
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
with
her
lips
pressed
tightly
together
and
a
light
in
her
eyes
then
she
looked
away
across
the
water
to
the
golden
hills
and
said
nothing
but
there
was
a
great
deal
in
that
look
of
eager
contradiction
yet
forced
agreement
of
determination
above
all
with
which
right
and
wrong
had
nothing
to
do
elinor
he
said
do
you
mean
that
child
to
grow
up
here
between
your
mother
and
you
in
ignorance
of
all
that
there
is
in
the
world
besides
you
two
that
child
she
cried
john
i
think
you
dislike
my
boy
for
of
course
it
is
pippo
you
mean
i
wish
you
would
not
call
him
by
that
absurd
name
you
are
hard
to
please
she
said
with
an
angry
laugh
i
think
it
is
a
very
sweet
little
name
the
child
will
not
always
be
a
baby
said
john
oh
no
i
suppose
if
we
all
live
long
enough
he
will
some
time
be
a
possibly
disagreeable
man
and
punish
us
well
for
all
the
care
we
have
spent
upon
him
elinor
said
i
do
want
to
make
you
angry
elinor
no
i
do
suppose
you
do
you
have
been
very
nice
to
me
john
you
have
neither
scolded
me
nor
given
me
good
advice
i
never
expected
you
would
have
been
so
forbearing
but
i
have
always
felt
you
must
mean
to
give
me
a
good
knock
at
the
end
you
do
me
great
injustice
he
said
much
wounded
you
know
that
i
think
only
of
what
is
best
for
you
and
the
child
they
were
approaching
the
shore
and
dennistoun
white
cap
was
visible
in
the
waning
light
looking
out
for
them
from
the
door
elinor
said
hastily
and
the
child
i
do
think
that
you
care
much
for
the
child
there
you
are
mistaken
elinor
i
did
not
perhaps
at
first
but
i
acknowledge
that
a
little
thing
like
that
does
somehow
creep
into
heart
her
face
which
had
been
gloomy
brightened
up
as
if
a
sunbeam
had
suddenly
burst
upon
it
oh
bless
you
john
uncle
john
how
good
and
how
kind
and
what
a
dear
friend
and
brother
you
are
and
i
such
a
wretch
ready
to
quarrel
with
those
i
love
best
but
john
let
me
keep
quiet
let
me
keep
still
do
make
me
rake
up
the
past
he
is
such
a
baby
such
a
baby
there
can
not
be
any
question
of
telling
him
anything
for
years
and
years
i
thought
you
were
lost
said
dennistoun
calling
to
them
i
began
to
think
of
all
kinds
of
things
that
might
have
happened
of
the
steamboat
running
into
you
or
the
boat
going
on
a
rock
or
you
need
not
have
had
any
fear
when
i
was
with
john
elinor
said
with
a
smile
that
made
him
warm
at
once
like
the
sun
he
knew
very
well
however
that
it
was
only
because
he
had
made
that
little
pleasant
speech
about
her
boy
chapter
xxxii
there
passed
after
this
a
number
of
years
of
which
i
can
make
no
record
the
ladies
remained
at
lakeside
seldom
moving
when
they
took
a
holiday
now
and
then
it
was
more
for
the
sake
of
the
little
community
which
just
as
in
windyhill
had
gathered
round
them
and
which
inquired
concerned
are
you
not
going
to
take
a
little
change
do
you
think
dear
dennistoun
your
daughter
would
be
the
better
for
a
change
do
you
really
think
that
a
little
sea
air
and
variety
would
be
good
for
the
boy
forced
by
these
kind
speeches
they
did
go
away
now
and
then
to
unknown
seaside
places
in
the
north
when
little
philip
was
still
a
child
and
to
quiet
places
abroad
when
he
grew
a
boy
and
it
was
thought
a
good
thing
for
him
to
learn
languages
and
to
be
taught
that
there
were
other
countries
in
the
world
besides
england
they
were
absent
for
one
whole
winter
in
france
and
another
in
germany
with
this
motive
that
philip
should
learn
these
languages
which
he
did
bien
que
with
much
assistance
from
his
mother
who
taught
herself
everything
that
she
thought
the
boy
should
know
and
shared
his
lessons
in
order
to
push
him
gently
forward
and
on
the
whole
he
did
very
well
in
this
particular
of
language
showing
much
aptitude
though
not
perhaps
much
application
i
would
not
assert
that
the
ladies
with
an
opinion
very
common
among
women
and
also
among
youth
in
general
did
not
rather
glory
in
the
thought
that
he
could
do
almost
anything
he
liked
which
was
their
opinion
and
in
some
degree
while
he
was
very
young
the
opinion
of
his
masters
with
the
appearance
of
doing
nothing
at
all
but
on
the
whole
his
education
was
the
most
difficult
matter
in
which
they
had
yet
been
engaged
how
was
he
to
be
educated
his
birth
and
condition
pointed
to
one
of
the
great
public
schools
and
dennistoun
who
had
made
many
economics
in
that
retirement
was
quite
able
to
give
the
child
what
they
both
called
the
best
education
but
how
could
they
send
him
to
eton
or
harrow
a
boy
who
knew
nothing
about
his
parentage
or
his
family
a
boy
bearing
a
name
who
would
be
subject
to
endless
questions
where
he
came
from
who
he
belonged
to
a
hundred
things
which
neither
in
waterdale
nor
in
their
travels
had
ever
been
asked
of
him
what
the
waterdale
people
thought
on
the
subject
or
how
much
they
knew
i
should
not
like
to
inquire
there
are
ways
of
finding
out
everything
and
people
who
possess
family
secrets
are
often
extraordinarily
deceived
in
respect
to
what
is
known
and
what
is
not
known
of
those
secrets
my
own
opinion
is
that
there
is
scarcely
such
a
thing
as
a
secret
in
the
world
if
any
moment
of
great
revolution
comes
in
your
life
you
generally
find
that
your
neighbours
are
not
much
surprised
they
have
known
it
or
they
have
suspected
it
all
along
and
it
is
well
if
they
have
not
suspected
more
than
the
truth
so
it
is
quite
possible
that
these
excellent
people
knew
all
about
elinor
but
elinor
did
not
think
so
which
was
the
great
thing
however
there
can
not
be
any
question
that
philip
education
was
a
very
great
difficulty
john
tatham
who
paid
them
a
visit
soberly
from
time
to
time
but
did
not
now
come
as
of
old
never
indeed
came
as
on
that
first
occasion
when
he
had
been
so
happy
and
so
undeceived
to
be
sure
as
philip
grew
up
it
was
of
course
impossible
for
any
one
to
be
like
that
from
the
time
pippo
was
five
or
six
he
went
everywhere
with
his
mother
her
sole
companion
in
general
and
when
there
was
a
visitor
always
making
a
third
in
the
party
a
third
who
was
really
the
first
for
he
appealed
to
his
mother
on
every
occasion
directed
her
attention
to
everything
he
only
learned
with
the
greatest
difficulty
that
it
was
possible
she
should
find
it
necessary
to
give
her
attention
in
a
greater
degree
to
any
one
else
when
she
said
you
know
pippo
i
must
talk
to
uncle
john
pippo
opened
his
great
eyes
not
than
to
me
mamma
yes
dearest
more
than
to
you
for
the
moment
for
he
has
come
a
long
way
to
see
us
and
he
will
soon
have
to
go
away
again
when
this
was
first
explained
to
him
pippo
inquired
particularly
when
his
uncle
john
was
going
away
and
was
delighted
to
hear
that
it
was
to
be
very
soon
however
as
he
grew
older
the
boy
began
to
take
great
pleasure
in
uncle
john
and
hung
upon
his
arm
when
they
went
out
for
their
walks
and
instead
of
endeavouring
to
monopolise
his
mother
turned
the
tables
upon
her
by
monopolising
this
the
only
man
who
belonged
to
him
and
to
whom
he
turned
with
the
instinct
of
budding
manhood
john
too
was
very
willing
to
be
thus
appropriated
and
it
came
to
pass
that
now
and
then
elinor
was
left
out
or
left
herself
out
of
the
calculation
urging
that
the
walk
they
were
planning
was
too
far
for
her
or
too
steep
for
her
or
too
something
so
that
the
boy
might
have
the
enjoyment
of
the
society
all
to
himself
this
changed
the
position
in
many
ways
and
i
am
not
sure
that
at
first
it
did
not
cost
elinor
a
little
thus
to
stand
aside
and
put
herself
out
of
that
first
place
which
had
always
been
by
all
of
them
accorded
to
her
but
if
this
was
so
it
was
soon
lost
in
the
consideration
of
how
good
it
was
for
pippo
to
have
a
man
like
john
to
talk
to
and
to
influence
him
in
every
way
a
man
like
john
that
was
the
thing
not
a
common
man
not
one
who
might
teach
him
the
baseness
or
the
frivolity
or
the
falsehood
of
the
world
but
a
good
man
who
was
also
a
distinguished
man
a
man
of
the
world
in
the
best
sense
knowing
life
in
the
best
sense
and
able
to
modify
the
boy
conception
of
what
he
was
to
find
in
the
world
as
women
could
never
do
for
after
all
that
can
be
said
we
are
not
good
for
much
on
those
points
mother
compton
would
say
i
do
know
elinor
i
doubt
whether
i
would
exchange
my
own
ideas
for
john
the
elder
lady
replied
ah
perhaps
mother
but
for
pippo
his
experience
and
his
knowledge
will
do
so
much
a
boy
should
not
be
brought
up
entirely
with
women
any
more
than
a
girl
should
be
with
men
i
have
often
thought
my
dear
said
dennistoun
if
in
providence
it
had
been
a
girl
instead
of
a
boy
oh
said
the
younger
mother
with
a
flush
how
can
you
speak
how
could
you
think
of
any
possible
child
but
pippo
i
would
not
give
him
for
a
score
of
girls
and
if
he
had
been
a
girl
you
would
not
have
changed
him
for
scores
of
boys
said
dennistoun
who
added
after
a
while
with
a
curious
sense
of
competition
and
a
determination
to
allow
no
inferiority
you
forget
elinor
that
my
only
child
is
a
girl
the
elder
lady
whom
they
began
to
call
the
old
lady
showed
a
great
deal
of
spirit
in
defence
of
her
own
but
philip
was
approaching
fourteen
and
the
great
question
had
to
be
decided
now
or
never
where
was
he
to
be
sent
to
school
it
was
difficult
now
to
send
him
to
bed
to
get
him
out
of
the
way
he
who
was
used
to
be
the
person
of
first
importance
in
the
house
in
order
that
the
others
might
settle
what
was
to
be
his
fate
and
accordingly
the
two
ladies
came
again
after
the
family
had
separated
in
the
usual
way
in
order
to
have
their
consultation
with
their
adviser
there
was
now
a
room
in
the
house
furnished
as
a
library
in
order
that
philip
might
have
a
place
in
which
to
carry
on
his
studies
and
where
the
gentlemen
might
have
their
talks
by
themselves
when
there
was
any
one
in
the
house
and
here
they
found
john
when
they
stole
in
one
after
the
other
that
the
boy
might
suspect
no
complot
they
had
their
scheme
it
need
not
be
doubted
and
john
had
his
he
pronounced
at
once
for
one
of
the
great
public
schools
while
the
ladies
on
their
part
had
heard
of
one
in
the
north
an
old
foundation
as
old
as
eton
where
there
was
at
the
moment
a
head
master
who
was
quite
exceptional
and
where
boys
were
winning
honours
in
all
directions
there
pippo
would
be
quite
safe
he
was
not
likely
to
meet
with
anybody
who
would
put
awkward
questions
and
yet
he
would
receive
an
education
as
good
as
any
one
probably
better
said
elinor
for
sage
will
have
few
pupils
like
him
and
therefore
will
give
him
the
more
attention
that
means
said
john
that
the
boy
will
not
be
among
his
equals
which
is
of
all
things
i
know
the
worst
for
a
boy
we
are
not
aristocrats
as
you
are
john
they
will
be
more
than
his
equal
in
one
way
because
many
of
them
will
be
bigger
and
stronger
than
he
and
that
is
what
counts
most
among
boys
besides
we
have
no
pretensions
my
dear
elinor
said
john
tatham
who
was
by
this
time
an
exceedingly
successful
lawyer
member
for
his
native
borough
and
within
sight
of
a
your
modesty
is
a
little
out
of
character
do
you
think
there
can
be
no
two
opinions
about
what
the
boy
is
an
aristocrat
if
you
choose
to
use
that
word
every
inch
of
him
a
little
gentleman
down
to
his
fingers
ends
oh
thank
you
john
cried
pippo
inconsistent
mother
that
is
the
thing
of
all
others
that
we
hoped
you
would
say
and
yet
you
are
going
to
send
him
among
the
farmers
sons
fine
fellows
i
grant
you
but
not
of
his
kind
have
you
heard
he
said
more
gravely
that
reginald
compton
died
last
year
we
saw
it
in
the
papers
said
dennistoun
elinor
said
nothing
but
turned
her
head
away
and
neither
of
the
others
are
married
or
likely
to
marry
one
of
them
is
very
much
broken
down
oh
john
john
for
god
sake
do
say
anything
more
i
must
elinor
there
is
but
one
good
life
and
that
in
a
dangerous
climate
and
with
all
the
risks
of
possible
fighting
between
the
boy
and
do
do
john
and
he
does
not
know
who
he
is
he
is
ignorant
of
everything
even
the
fact
the
great
fact
which
you
have
no
right
to
keep
from
him
john
she
cried
starting
to
her
feet
the
boy
is
mine
i
have
a
right
to
deal
with
him
as
i
think
best
i
will
not
hear
a
word
you
have
to
say
it
is
vain
to
say
anything
said
dennistoun
she
will
not
hear
a
word
that
is
all
very
well
so
far
as
she
is
concerned
said
john
but
i
have
a
part
of
my
own
to
play
you
give
me
the
name
of
adviser
and
so
forth
a
man
can
not
be
your
adviser
if
his
mouth
is
closed
before
he
speaks
i
have
a
right
to
speak
being
summoned
for
that
purpose
i
tell
you
elinor
that
you
have
no
right
to
conceal
from
the
boy
who
he
is
and
that
his
father
is
alive
she
gave
a
cry
as
if
he
had
struck
her
and
shrank
away
behind
her
mother
hiding
her
face
in
her
hands
i
am
more
or
less
of
your
opinion
john
i
have
told
her
the
same
while
he
was
a
baby
it
mattered
nothing
now
that
he
is
a
rational
creature
with
an
opinion
of
his
own
like
any
one
of
us
mother
cried
elinor
you
are
unkind
oh
you
are
unkind
what
did
it
matter
so
long
as
he
was
a
baby
but
now
he
is
just
at
the
age
when
he
would
be
if
you
do
wish
to
drive
me
out
of
my
senses
altogether
do
say
a
word
more
to
me
of
this
kind
elinor
said
john
i
have
said
nothing
on
the
subject
for
many
years
though
i
have
thought
much
and
you
must
for
once
hear
reason
the
boy
belongs
to
his
father
as
much
as
to
you
i
have
said
it
i
can
not
take
it
back
he
belongs
to
the
family
of
which
he
may
one
day
be
the
head
you
can
not
throw
away
his
birthright
and
think
if
you
let
him
grow
up
like
this
not
knowing
that
he
has
a
family
or
a
unaware
whom
he
belongs
to
have
you
done
john
asked
elinor
who
had
made
two
or
three
efforts
to
interrupt
and
had
been
beating
her
foot
impatiently
upon
the
ground
if
you
ask
me
in
that
tone
i
suppose
i
must
say
yes
though
i
have
a
great
deal
more
that
i
should
like
to
say
then
hear
me
speak
cried
elinor
of
us
three
at
least
i
am
the
only
one
to
whom
he
belongs
i
only
have
power
to
decide
for
him
and
i
say
no
no
whatever
argument
there
may
be
whatever
plea
you
may
bring
forward
no
and
no
and
after
that
no
what
at
fourteen
just
the
age
when
anything
that
was
said
to
him
would
tell
the
most
when
he
would
learn
a
lesson
the
quickest
learn
what
i
would
die
to
keep
him
from
when
he
would
take
everything
for
gospel
that
was
said
to
him
when
the
very
charm
of
of
that
unknown
name
she
stopped
for
a
moment
to
take
breath
half
choked
by
her
own
words
and
you
ought
to
remember
no
one
has
ever
laid
claim
to
him
why
should
i
tell
him
of
one
that
never
even
inquired
no
john
no
no
no
a
baby
he
might
have
been
told
and
it
would
have
done
him
no
harm
perhaps
you
were
right
you
and
mother
and
i
was
wrong
he
might
have
known
it
from
the
first
and
thought
very
little
of
it
and
he
may
know
when
he
is
a
man
and
his
character
is
formed
and
he
knows
what
things
mean
but
a
boy
of
fourteen
imagine
the
glamour
there
would
be
about
the
very
name
how
he
would
feel
we
must
all
have
been
unjust
and
the
the
other
injured
you
know
from
yourself
john
how
he
clings
to
you
you
who
are
only
a
cousin
he
knows
that
yet
he
insists
upon
uncle
john
the
one
man
who
belongs
to
him
and
looks
up
to
you
and
thinks
nothing
of
any
of
us
in
comparison
i
like
it
i
like
it
cried
elinor
dashing
the
tears
from
her
eyes
i
am
not
jealous
but
fancy
what
it
would
be
with
the
other
the
real
the
i
can
not
can
not
say
the
word
yes
the
father
if
it
is
so
with
you
what
would
it
be
with
him
john
listened
with
his
head
bent
down
leaning
on
his
hand
every
word
went
to
his
heart
yes
he
was
nothing
but
a
cousin
it
was
true
the
boy
did
not
belong
to
him
was
nothing
to
him
if
the
father
stepped
in
the
real
father
the
man
of
whom
philip
had
never
heard
in
all
the
glory
of
his
natural
rights
and
the
novelty
and
wonder
of
his
existence
how
different
would
that
be
from
any
feeling
that
could
be
raised
by
a
cousin
an
uncle
with
whom
the
boy
had
played
all
his
life
no
doubt
it
was
true
and
phil
compton
would
probably
charm
the
inexperienced
boy
with
his
handsome
disreputable
grace
and
the
unknown
ways
of
the
man
of
the
world
and
yet
he
thought
to
himself
there
is
a
perspicacity
about
children
which
is
not
always
present
in
a
man
philip
had
no
precocious
instincts
to
be
tempted
by
his
father
habits
he
had
the
true
sight
of
a
boy
trained
amid
everything
that
was
noble
and
pure
would
it
indeed
be
more
dangerous
now
when
the
boy
was
a
boy
with
all
those
safeguards
of
nature
than
when
he
was
a
man
john
kept
his
mind
to
this
question
with
the
firmness
of
a
trained
intelligence
not
letting
himself
go
off
into
other
matters
or
pausing
to
feel
the
sting
that
was
in
elinor
words
the
reminder
that
though
he
had
been
so
much
he
was
still
nothing
to
the
family
to
whom
he
had
consecrated
so
much
of
his
life
so
much
now
of
his
thoughts
i
do
not
think
i
agree
with
you
elinor
he
said
at
last
i
think
it
would
have
been
better
had
he
always
known
that
his
father
lived
and
who
he
was
and
what
family
he
belonged
to
that
is
not
to
say
that
you
were
to
thrust
him
into
his
father
arms
and
i
think
now
that
though
we
can
not
redeem
the
past
it
should
be
done
as
soon
as
possible
and
that
he
should
know
before
he
goes
to
school
i
think
the
effect
will
be
less
now
than
if
the
discovery
bursts
upon
him
when
he
is
a
young
man
when
he
finds
perhaps
as
may
well
be
that
his
position
and
all
his
prospects
are
changed
in
a
moment
when
he
may
be
called
upon
without
any
preparation
to
assume
a
name
and
a
rank
of
which
he
knows
nothing
not
a
name
he
has
always
borne
his
true
name
his
true
name
may
be
changed
at
any
moment
elinor
he
may
become
lord
lomond
and
the
heir
my
dear
said
dennistoun
growing
red
that
is
a
chance
we
have
never
taken
into
account
what
has
that
to
do
with
it
she
said
is
his
happiness
and
his
honour
to
be
put
in
comparison
with
a
chance
a
possibility
that
may
never
come
true
john
for
the
sake
of
everything
that
is
good
let
him
wait
till
he
is
a
man
and
knows
good
from
evil
it
is
that
i
am
thinking
of
elinor
a
boy
of
fourteen
often
knows
good
from
evil
much
better
than
a
youth
of
which
is
i
suppose
what
you
call
a
man
my
opinion
is
that
it
would
be
better
and
safer
now
no
she
said
and
no
i
will
never
consent
to
it
if
you
go
and
poison
my
boy
mind
i
will
never
forgive
you
john
i
have
no
right
to
do
anything
he
said
it
is
of
course
you
who
must
decide
elinor
i
advise
only
and
i
might
as
well
give
that
up
he
added
do
you
think
for
you
are
not
to
be
guided
by
me
and
she
was
of
course
supreme
in
everything
that
concerned
her
son
john
when
he
could
do
no
more
knew
how
to
be
silent
and
dennistoun
if
not
so
wise
in
this
respect
was
yet
more
easily
silenced
than
john
and
philip
compton
went
to
the
old
among
the
dales
where
was
the
young
and
energetic
who
as
elinor
anticipated
found
this
one
pupil
like
a
pearl
among
the
pebbles
of
the
shore
and
spared
no
pains
to
polish
him
and
perfect
him
in
every
way
known
to
the
ambitious
schoolmaster
of
modern
times
chapter
xxxiii
it
is
needless
to
say
that
the
years
which
developed
elinor
child
into
a
youth
on
the
verge
of
manhood
had
not
passed
by
the
others
of
the
family
without
full
evidence
of
its
progress
john
tatham
was
no
longer
within
the
elastic
boundaries
of
that
conventional
youth
which
is
allowed
to
stretch
so
far
when
a
man
remains
unmarried
he
might
have
been
characterized
as
according
to
the
fine
distinction
of
our
neighbours
in
france
had
he
desired
it
but
he
did
not
desire
it
he
had
never
altogether
neglected
society
having
a
wholesome
liking
for
the
company
of
his
fellow
creatures
but
neither
had
he
ever
plunged
into
it
as
those
do
who
must
keep
their
places
in
the
crowd
or
die
john
had
pursued
the
middle
path
which
is
the
most
difficult
he
had
cultivated
friends
not
a
mob
of
acquaintances
although
as
people
say
he
knew
everybody
as
a
man
who
had
attained
his
position
and
won
his
success
could
scarcely
fail
to
do
he
had
succeeded
indeed
not
in
the
fabulous
way
that
some
men
do
but
in
a
way
which
most
men
in
his
profession
looked
upon
as
in
the
highest
degree
satisfactory
he
had
a
silk
gown
like
any
dowager
he
had
been
leading
counsel
in
many
cases
which
were
now
of
note
he
was
among
not
the
two
or
three
perhaps
but
the
twenty
or
thirty
who
were
at
the
head
of
his
profession
if
he
had
not
gone
further
it
was
perhaps
more
from
lack
of
ambition
than
from
want
of
power
he
had
been
for
years
in
parliament
but
preferred
his
independence
to
the
chance
of
office
it
is
impossible
to
tell
how
john
character
and
wishes
might
have
been
modified
had
he
married
and
had
children
round
him
like
other
men
had
the
tall
boy
in
the
north
the
young
hero
of
lakeside
been
his
what
a
difference
would
that
have
made
in
his
views
of
life
but
philip
was
not
his
nor
mother
probably
as
he
always
said
to
himself
from
his
own
fault
this
as
the
reader
is
aware
had
always
been
fully
recognised
by
john
himself
perhaps
in
the
old
days
in
those
days
when
everything
was
possible
he
had
not
even
recognised
that
there
was
but
one
woman
in
the
world
whom
he
could
ever
wish
to
marry
probably
it
was
only
her
appropriation
by
another
that
revealed
this
fact
to
him
there
are
men
like
this
to
be
found
everywhere
not
so
hotly
constituted
as
to
seize
for
themselves
what
is
most
necessary
for
their
personal
happiness
possessed
by
so
many
other
subjects
that
this
seems
a
thing
to
be
thought
of
which
is
generally
too
late
but
john
tatham
was
neither
a
disappointed
nor
an
unhappy
man
he
might
have
attained
a
higher
development
and
more
brilliant
and
full
life
but
that
was
all
and
how
few
men
are
there
of
whom
this
could
not
be
said
he
had
become
tatham
of
tatham
cross
as
well
as
and
a
county
gentleman
of
modest
but
effective
standing
a
lawyer
of
high
reputation
quite
eligible
either
for
the
bench
or
for
political
elevation
had
he
cared
for
either
a
member
of
parliament
with
a
distinct
standing
and
therefore
importance
of
his
own
there
was
probably
throughout
england
no
society
in
which
he
could
have
found
himself
where
his
position
and
importance
would
have
been
unknown
he
was
a
man
approaching
fifty
who
had
not
yet
lost
any
of
the
power
of
enjoyment
or
begun
to
feel
the
inroads
of
decay
at
the
very
height
of
life
and
unconscious
that
the
ground
would
shortly
begin
to
slope
downwards
under
his
feet
indeed
it
showed
no
such
indication
as
yet
and
probably
would
not
do
so
for
years
the
broad
plateau
of
middle
age
lasts
often
till
sixty
or
even
beyond
there
was
no
reason
to
doubt
that
for
john
tatham
it
would
last
as
long
as
for
any
man
his
health
was
perfect
and
his
habits
those
of
a
man
whose
self
had
never
demanded
indulgences
of
the
vulgar
kind
he
had
given
up
with
some
regret
but
years
before
his
chambers
in
the
temple
that
is
he
retained
them
as
chambers
but
lived
in
them
no
longer
he
had
a
house
in
one
of
the
streets
about
belgrave
square
one
of
those
little
bits
of
awkward
streets
where
there
are
some
of
the
pleasantest
houses
of
a
moderate
kind
in
london
furnished
from
top
to
bottom
the
stairs
the
comfortable
quaint
landings
the
bits
of
corridor
and
passage
nothing
naked
or
neglected
about
it
no
cold
corner
but
nothing
fantastic
not
very
much
ornament
a
few
good
pictures
a
great
deal
of
dark
mahogany
with
a
general
flavour
of
sherraton
and
chippendale
and
abundance
of
books
everywhere
john
was
able
to
permit
himself
various
little
indulgences
on
which
wives
are
said
to
look
with
jealous
eyes
he
had
a
fancy
for
rare
editions
in
which
i
sympathise
and
also
for
bindings
which
seems
to
me
a
weakness
however
it
was
one
which
he
indulged
in
moderation
he
possessed
in
his
which
was
not
very
much
used
a
beautiful
harpsichord
and
also
he
had
belonging
to
him
a
fiddle
of
value
untold
i
ought
of
course
to
say
violin
or
rather
to
distinguish
the
instrument
by
its
family
name
i
have
no
doubt
it
was
a
stradivarius
but
there
is
an
affectionate
humour
in
the
fiddle
which
does
not
consist
with
fine
titles
he
had
always
been
fond
of
music
but
even
the
stradivarius
did
not
beguile
him
in
the
days
of
which
i
speak
to
play
nor
perhaps
was
his
performance
worthy
of
it
though
his
taste
was
said
to
be
excellent
it
will
be
perceived
by
all
this
that
john
tatham
life
had
many
pleasures
and
i
am
not
myself
sorry
for
him
because
he
was
not
married
as
many
people
will
be
perhaps
it
is
a
little
doleful
coming
home
when
there
is
never
anybody
looking
out
for
you
expecting
you
but
then
he
had
never
been
accustomed
to
look
for
that
and
the
effect
might
have
been
irksome
rather
than
pleasant
his
household
went
on
velvet
under
the
care
of
a
respectable
couple
who
had
done
for
tatham
for
years
he
would
not
have
submitted
to
extortion
or
waste
but
everything
was
ample
in
the
house
the
cook
by
no
means
stinted
in
respect
to
butter
or
any
of
those
condiments
which
are
as
necessary
to
good
cooking
as
air
is
to
life
tatham
would
not
have
understood
a
lack
of
anything
or
that
what
was
served
to
him
should
not
have
been
the
best
supplied
and
served
in
the
best
way
failure
on
such
points
would
have
so
much
surprised
him
that
he
would
scarcely
have
known
what
steps
to
take
but
jervis
his
butler
knew
what
was
best
as
well
as
tatham
did
and
was
quite
as
little
disposed
to
put
up
with
any
shortcoming
i
say
i
am
not
sorry
for
him
that
he
was
not
married
up
to
this
time
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
time
does
come
when
one
becomes
sorry
for
the
highly
respectable
refined
and
agreeable
man
who
has
everything
that
heart
can
desire
except
the
best
things
in
life
love
and
the
companionship
of
those
who
are
his
very
own
when
old
age
looms
in
sight
everything
is
changed
but
tatham
as
has
been
said
was
not
quite
fifty
and
old
age
seemed
as
far
off
as
if
it
could
never
be
he
was
a
man
who
was
very
good
to
a
number
of
people
and
spent
almost
as
much
money
in
being
kind
as
if
he
had
possessed
extravagant
children
of
his
own
his
sister
mary
for
instance
had
married
a
clergyman
not
very
well
off
and
the
natural
result
had
followed
how
they
could
have
existed
without
uncle
john
much
less
how
they
could
have
stumbled
into
public
schools
scholarships
and
all
the
rest
of
it
would
be
difficult
to
tell
especially
now
in
these
days
when
a
girl
schooling
ought
we
are
told
to
cost
as
much
as
a
boy
this
latter
is
a
grievance
which
must
be
apparent
to
the
meanest
capacity
unless
the
girl
binds
herself
by
the
most
stringent
vows
to
marry
a
poor
curate
or
other
penniless
man
the
moment
that
you
have
completed
her
expensive
education
i
do
not
think
she
should
in
any
case
be
permitted
to
go
to
girton
it
is
all
very
well
when
the
parents
are
rich
or
the
girls
have
a
sufficiency
of
their
own
but
to
spend
all
that
on
a
process
which
instead
of
fructifying
in
other
schools
and
colleges
or
producing
in
life
a
highly
accomplished
woman
is
to
be
lost
at
once
and
swallowed
up
in
another
nursery
is
the
most
unprofitable
of
benefactions
this
is
what
mary
tatham
eldest
girl
had
just
done
almost
before
her
bills
at
newnham
had
been
paid
a
wedding
present
had
so
to
speak
been
demanded
from
uncle
john
at
the
end
of
the
bayonet
to
show
his
satisfaction
in
the
event
which
had
taken
all
meaning
out
of
his
exertions
for
little
mary
he
had
given
it
indeed
in
the
shape
not
of
a
which
is
what
she
would
have
deserved
but
of
a
cheque
but
he
was
not
pleased
neither
was
he
pleased
as
has
been
seen
by
the
proceedings
of
elinor
who
had
slighted
all
his
advice
yet
clung
to
himself
in
a
way
some
women
have
i
do
not
know
whether
men
expect
you
to
be
quite
as
much
their
friend
as
ever
after
they
have
rejected
your
counsel
and
taken
their
own
exactly
opposite
way
but
women
do
and
indeed
i
think
expect
you
to
be
rather
grateful
that
they
have
not
taken
amiss
the
advice
which
they
have
rejected
and
despised
this
was
elinor
case
she
hoped
that
john
was
ashamed
of
advising
her
to
make
her
boy
acquainted
with
his
family
and
the
fact
of
his
father
existence
and
that
he
duly
appreciated
the
fact
that
she
did
not
resent
that
advice
and
then
she
expected
from
him
the
same
attention
to
herself
and
her
son
as
if
the
boy
had
been
guided
in
his
and
not
in
her
way
thus
it
will
be
seen
his
friends
and
relations
expected
a
very
great
deal
from
john
he
had
gone
to
his
chambers
one
afternoon
after
he
left
the
law
courts
and
was
there
very
busily
engaged
in
getting
up
his
notes
for
work
when
he
received
a
visit
which
awakened
at
once
echoes
of
the
past
and
alarms
for
the
future
in
john
mind
it
was
very
early
in
the
year
the
end
of
january
and
the
house
was
not
sitting
so
that
his
public
duties
were
less
overwhelming
than
usual
his
room
was
the
same
in
which
we
have
already
seen
on
various
occasions
and
which
elinor
in
her
youth
before
anything
had
happened
to
make
life
serious
for
her
had
been
in
the
habit
of
calling
the
star
chamber
for
no
reason
in
the
world
except
that
law
and
penalties
or
judgments
upon
herself
in
her
unripe
conviction
and
suggestions
of
what
ought
to
be
done
came
from
that
place
to
which
dennistoun
had
made
resort
in
her
perplexities
almost
from
the
very
beginning
of
john
reign
there
tatham
had
been
detained
beyond
his
usual
time
by
the
importance
of
the
case
for
which
he
was
preparing
and
a
clerk
very
impatient
to
get
free
yet
obliged
to
simulate
content
had
lighted
the
lamp
and
replenished
the
fire
it
had
always
been
a
comfortable
room
the
lamp
by
which
john
worked
had
a
green
shade
which
concentrated
the
light
upon
a
table
covered
with
that
litter
of
papers
in
which
there
seemed
so
little
order
yet
which
tatham
knew
to
the
last
scrap
as
if
they
had
been
the
tidiest
in
the
world
the
long
glazed
which
filled
up
one
side
of
the
room
gave
a
dark
reflection
of
the
light
and
of
the
leaping
brightness
of
the
fire
the
curtains
were
drawn
over
the
windows
if
the
clerk
fumed
in
the
outer
rooms
here
all
was
studious
life
and
quiet
no
spectator
could
have
been
otherwise
than
impressed
by
the
air
of
absolute
with
which
the
eminent
lawyer
gave
himself
up
to
his
work
he
was
like
his
lamp
giving
all
the
light
in
him
to
the
special
subject
indifferent
to
everything
outside
what
is
it
simmons
he
said
abruptly
without
looking
up
a
lady
sir
who
says
she
has
urgent
business
and
must
see
you
a
lady
who
see
me
john
tatham
smiled
at
the
very
ineffectual
which
meant
coercion
and
distraction
to
him
i
do
see
how
she
is
going
to
accomplish
that
i
told
her
so
said
the
clerk
well
you
must
tell
her
so
again
he
had
scarcely
lifted
his
head
from
his
work
so
that
it
was
unnecessary
to
return
to
it
when
the
door
closed
and
tatham
went
on
steadily
as
before
it
is
easy
to
concentrate
the
light
of
the
lamp
when
it
is
duly
shaded
and
no
wind
to
blow
it
about
and
it
is
easy
to
concentrate
a
attention
in
the
absolute
quiet
when
nothing
interrupts
him
but
when
there
suddenly
rises
up
a
wind
of
talk
in
the
room
which
is
separated
from
him
only
by
a
door
a
tempest
of
chattering
words
and
laughter
shrill
and
bursting
forth
in
something
like
shrieks
making
the
student
start
that
is
altogether
a
different
business
the
lady
outside
who
evidently
had
multiplied
herself
unless
it
was
conceivable
that
the
serious
simmons
had
made
himself
her
accomplice
had
taken
the
cleverest
way
of
showing
that
she
was
not
to
be
beat
by
any
passive
resistance
of
busy
man
though
not
even
an
audible
conversation
with
simmons
would
have
startled
or
disturbed
his
master
to
whom
it
would
have
been
apparent
that
his
faithful
vassal
was
thus
defending
his
own
stronghold
and
innermost
retirement
but
this
was
quite
independent
of
simmons
a
discussion
in
two
voices
one
and
shrill
the
other
softer
but
both
absolutely
unrestrained
by
any
consciousness
of
being
in
a
place
where
the
chatter
of
strange
voices
is
forbidden
and
stillness
and
quiet
a
condition
of
being
the
sound
of
the
talk
rang
through
tatham
head
as
if
all
the
city
bells
were
ringing
one
of
the
unseen
ladies
had
a
very
shrill
laugh
to
which
she
gave
vent
freely
john
fidgeted
in
his
chair
raised
up
his
eyes
above
the
level
of
his
spectacles
he
wore
spectacles
alas
by
this
time
habitually
when
he
worked
as
if
lifting
a
voiceless
appeal
to
those
powers
who
interest
themselves
in
law
cases
to
preserve
him
from
disturbance
then
made
a
manly
effort
to
disregard
the
sounds
that
filled
the
air
returning
with
a
shake
of
his
head
to
his
reading
but
at
the
end
of
a
long
day
and
in
the
dulness
of
the
afternoon
perhaps
a
man
is
less
capable
than
at
other
moments
to
fight
against
interruption
of
this
kind
and
finally
he
threw
down
his
papers
and
touched
his
bell
simmons
came
in
full
of
pale
indignation
which
made
itself
felt
even
beyond
the
circle
illuminated
by
the
lamp
what
can
i
do
he
said
they
planted
themselves
by
the
fire
and
there
they
mean
to
stay
very
well
we
wait
they
said
quite
calm
and
i
make
no
doubt
they
will
having
nothing
else
to
do
till
all
is
blue
simmons
had
a
gift
of
expression
of
which
all
his
friends
were
flatteringly
sensible
and
he
was
very
friendly
and
condescending
to
john
of
whom
he
had
taken
care
for
many
years
what
is
to
be
done
said
tatham
ca
you
do
anything
to
get
them
away
simmons
shook
his
head
there
two
of
them
he
said
and
they
entertain
each
other
and
they
think
it
fun
to
jabber
like
that
in
a
lawyer
office
the
young
one
says
a
queer
place
and
the
other
she
holds
forth
about
other
times
when
she
been
here
oh
she
been
here
other
times
do
you
know
her
simmons
not
from
adam
tatham
or
i
should
say
from
eve
as
she
a
lady
but
a
real
lady
i
should
say
though
she
do
behave
herself
as
such
one
of
the
impudent
ones
they
are
never
impudent
like
that
said
simmons
with
profound
observation
unless
they
are
real
high
or
real
low
hum
said
john
hesitating
and
then
he
added
there
is
a
young
one
you
say
but
i
do
not
myself
think
though
the
may
imagine
it
to
be
so
that
it
was
because
there
was
a
young
one
that
john
gave
in
it
was
because
he
could
do
nothing
else
the
noise
and
chatter
of
the
voices
being
entirely
destructive
of
that
undisturbed
state
of
the
atmosphere
in
which
work
can
be
done
it
was
not
merely
the
sounds
but
the
vibration
they
made
in
the
air
breaking
all
its
harmony
and
concentration
he
tried
a
little
longer
but
was
unsuccessful
and
finally
in
despair
he
said
to
simmons
you
had
better
show
them
in
and
let
me
get
done
with
them
in
an
angry
tone
oh
he
will
see
us
after
all
said
the
voice
so
good
of
tatham
but
of
course
i
should
have
waited
all
the
same
dolly
take
toto
i
ca
possibly
get
up
while
i
have
him
on
my
knee
you
can
tell
tatham
i
did
not
send
in
my
name
to
disturb
him
which
makes
it
all
the
more
charitable
of
him
to
receive
me
but
dear
me
of
course
i
can
tell
him
that
himself
as
he
consents
to
see
us
dolly
do
strangle
my
poor
darling
i
never
saw
a
girl
that
did
know
how
to
take
up
a
dear
dog
before
he
only
a
snappish
little
demon
and
you
spoil
him
so
said
the
other
voice
this
was
attended
by
the
sound
of
movement
as
if
the
party
were
getting
under
weigh
my
poor
darling
pet
it
is
only
her
jealousy
is
that
the
way
yes
to
be
sure
it
is
the
next
room
now
dolly
remember
this
is
where
all
the
poor
people
are
ruined
and
done
for
leave
hope
behind
all
ye
who
enter
here
a
little
shriek
of
laughter
ended
this
speech
and
john
looking
up
taking
off
his
spectacles
and
raising
a
little
the
shade
of
the
lamp
saw
in
the
doorway
lady
mariamne
altered
as
was
inevitable
by
the
strain
and
stress
of
nearly
twenty
years
chapter
xxxiv
i
do
not
mean
to
assert
that
john
tatham
had
not
seen
lady
mariamne
during
these
twenty
years
or
that
her
changed
appearance
burst
upon
him
with
anything
like
a
shock
in
society
when
you
are
once
a
member
of
that
little
world
within
a
world
everybody
sees
everybody
else
from
time
to
time
he
had
not
recognised
her
voice
for
he
was
not
in
the
smallest
degree
thinking
of
lady
mariamne
or
of
any
member
of
her
family
notwithstanding
that
they
now
and
then
did
make
a
very
marked
appearance
in
his
mind
in
respect
of
the
important
question
of
that
connection
which
elinor
in
her
foolishness
tried
to
ignore
and
john
was
not
at
all
shocked
by
the
progress
of
that
twenty
years
as
reflected
in
the
appearance
of
this
lady
who
was
about
his
own
standing
a
woman
very
near
fifty
but
who
had
fought
strenuously
against
every
sign
of
her
age
as
some
women
foolishly
do
the
result
was
in
lady
case
as
in
many
others
that
the
number
of
her
years
looked
more
like
a
hundred
and
fifty
than
their
natural
limit
a
woman
of
her
class
has
but
two
alternatives
as
she
gets
old
she
must
get
stout
in
which
case
though
she
becomes
unwieldy
she
preserves
something
of
her
bloom
or
she
may
grow
thin
and
become
a
spectre
upon
which
art
has
to
do
so
much
that
nature
flouted
and
tortured
becomes
vindictive
and
withdraws
every
modifying
quality
lady
mariamne
had
i
fear
false
hair
false
teeth
false
complexion
everything
that
invention
could
do
in
a
poor
little
human
countenance
intended
for
no
such
manipulation
the
consequence
was
that
every
natural
advantage
and
there
are
some
which
age
confers
as
well
as
many
that
age
takes
away
was
lost
the
skin
was
parchment
the
eyes
were
like
eyes
of
fishes
the
teeth
too
white
and
too
perfect
looked
like
the
horrible
things
in
the
dentists
windows
which
was
precisely
what
they
were
on
such
a
woman
the
very
height
of
the
fashion
to
which
she
so
often
attaches
herself
with
desperation
has
an
antiquated
air
everything
swears
as
the
french
say
with
everything
else
the
softness
the
whiteness
the
ease
the
of
advancing
age
are
all
so
many
ornaments
if
people
but
knew
but
lady
mariamne
had
none
of
these
she
wore
a
warm
cloak
in
her
carriage
it
is
true
but
that
had
dropped
from
her
shoulders
leaving
her
in
all
the
rigidity
in
which
youth
is
trim
and
slim
and
elastic
as
becomes
it
it
is
true
that
many
a
woman
of
fifty
is
as
john
tatham
was
serenely
dwelling
on
that
tableland
which
shows
but
little
difference
between
the
crown
of
life
and
but
lady
mariamne
was
not
one
of
these
she
had
gone
too
fast
she
would
herself
have
allowed
the
pace
had
been
too
much
for
such
survivals
she
was
of
the
awful
order
of
superannuated
beauties
of
which
rider
haggard
would
in
vain
persuade
us
she
was
not
one
i
am
myself
convinced
that
she
thousands
of
years
were
all
written
on
her
fictitious
complexion
and
that
other
people
saw
them
clearly
if
not
her
unfortunate
lover
and
lady
mariamne
had
come
to
be
of
the
order
of
she
by
dint
of
wiping
out
the
traces
of
her
fifty
years
she
had
made
herself
look
as
if
she
might
have
been
a
thousand
and
in
this
guise
she
appeared
to
the
robust
ruddy
man
of
her
own
age
as
she
stood
with
a
fantastic
little
giggle
calling
his
attention
on
the
threshold
of
his
door
behind
lady
mariamne
was
a
very
different
figure
that
of
the
serious
and
independent
girl
without
any
illusions
who
is
in
so
many
cases
the
child
of
such
a
mother
and
who
is
in
revolt
so
complete
from
all
that
mother
traditions
so
highly
set
on
the
crown
of
every
opposite
principle
that
nature
vindicates
itself
by
the
possibility
that
she
may
at
any
moment
topple
over
and
become
again
what
her
mother
was
he
would
have
been
a
bold
man
however
who
in
the
present
stage
would
have
prophesied
any
such
fate
for
dolly
prestwich
who
between
working
at
whitechapel
attending
on
a
ward
in
thomas
drawing
three
days
a
week
in
the
slade
school
and
other
labours
of
equally
varied
descriptions
had
her
time
very
fully
taken
up
and
only
on
special
occasions
had
time
to
accompany
her
mother
she
had
been
beguiled
on
this
occasion
by
the
family
history
which
was
concerned
and
which
de
as
dolly
was
excited
her
curiosity
almost
as
much
as
if
she
had
been
born
in
the
forties
dolly
was
never
unkind
sometimes
indeed
was
quite
the
reverse
to
her
mother
when
tatham
with
a
brutal
unconsciousness
of
what
is
desirable
placed
a
chair
for
lady
mariamne
in
front
of
the
fire
dolly
twisted
it
round
with
a
dexterous
movement
so
as
to
shield
the
countenance
which
was
not
adapted
for
any
such
illumination
for
herself
dolly
cared
nothing
whether
it
was
the
noonday
sun
or
the
blaze
of
a
furnace
that
shone
upon
her
she
defied
them
both
to
make
her
wink
as
for
complexion
she
scorned
that
vanity
she
had
not
very
much
it
is
true
having
been
scorched
red
and
brown
in
alpine
expeditions
in
the
autumn
she
was
now
of
a
somewhat
dry
hue
the
result
of
much
loss
of
cuticle
and
constant
encounter
with
london
fogs
and
smoke
she
carried
toto
who
was
a
shrinking
chilly
italian
greyhound
in
a
coat
carelessly
under
one
arm
and
sat
down
beside
her
mother
studying
the
papers
on
john
table
with
exceedingly
curious
eyes
she
would
have
liked
to
go
over
all
his
notes
about
his
case
and
form
her
own
opinion
on
it
which
she
would
have
done
we
may
be
sure
much
more
rapidly
and
with
more
decision
than
tatham
could
do
so
here
i
am
again
you
will
say
said
lady
mariamne
she
had
taken
off
her
gloves
and
was
smoothing
her
hands
from
the
points
of
the
fingers
downwards
not
i
believe
with
any
intention
of
demonstrating
their
whiteness
but
solely
because
she
had
once
done
so
and
the
habit
remained
she
wore
several
fine
rings
and
her
hands
were
still
pretty
and
unlike
the
rest
of
her
younger
than
her
age
they
made
a
little
show
with
their
sparkling
diamonds
just
catching
the
edge
of
the
light
from
john
shaded
lamp
her
face
by
dolly
help
was
in
the
shadow
of
the
green
shade
you
will
say
so
tatham
i
know
here
she
is
again
without
thinking
how
i
have
been
never
to
come
never
to
ask
a
single
question
for
all
these
years
the
loss
is
mine
lady
mariamne
said
john
gravely
it
very
pretty
of
you
to
say
that
is
it
dolly
one
old
flirts
do
always
show
up
so
well
and
here
the
lady
gave
a
laugh
such
as
had
once
been
supposed
to
be
one
of
lady
mariamne
charms
but
which
was
rather
like
a
giggle
now
an
antiquated
giggle
which
is
much
less
satisfactory
than
the
genuine
article
how
i
used
to
worry
you
about
poor
phil
and
that
little
spitfire
of
a
nell
and
what
a
mess
they
have
made
of
it
i
suppose
you
know
what
changes
have
happened
in
the
family
tatham
since
those
days
i
heard
indeed
with
regret
lady
mariamne
that
you
had
lost
a
brother
a
brother
two
she
cried
is
it
extraordinary
poor
hal
that
was
the
picture
of
health
how
little
one
knows
he
just
went
do
you
know
without
any
one
ever
thinking
he
would
go
regg
in
india
was
different
you
expect
that
sort
of
thing
when
a
man
is
in
india
but
poor
hal
i
told
you
tatham
would
have
heard
of
it
dolly
not
being
in
our
own
set
do
you
know
it
was
in
all
the
papers
said
miss
dolly
ah
well
you
did
notice
it
i
suppose
or
perhaps
you
were
away
i
always
say
it
is
of
no
use
being
married
or
dying
or
anything
else
in
september
your
friends
never
hear
of
it
you
will
wonder
that
i
am
not
in
black
but
black
was
always
very
unbecoming
to
me
and
dark
grey
is
just
as
good
and
does
make
one
quite
so
ghastly
but
the
funny
thing
is
that
now
phil
who
looked
as
if
he
never
could
be
in
the
running
do
you
know
is
heir
presumptive
is
it
extraordinary
two
gone
and
phil
that
lived
much
faster
than
either
of
them
and
at
one
time
kept
up
an
awful
pace
has
seen
them
both
out
and
serf
has
never
married
he
wo
now
though
i
have
been
at
him
on
the
subject
for
years
he
says
not
if
he
knows
it
in
the
horrid
way
men
have
and
i
do
wonder
much
for
he
has
had
some
nasty
experiences
poor
fellow
there
was
lady
oh
i
almost
forgot
you
were
there
dolly
you
need
mind
me
said
dolly
gravely
i
heard
just
as
bad
well
said
lady
mariamne
with
a
giggle
did
you
ever
know
anything
like
those
girls
they
are
not
afraid
of
anything
now
when
i
was
a
girl
do
you
remember
what
an
innocent
dear
i
was
mr
tatham
like
a
lamb
never
suspecting
that
there
was
any
naughtiness
in
the
world
john
endeavoured
to
put
on
a
smile
in
feeble
sympathy
with
the
uproariousness
of
lady
mariamne
laugh
but
her
daughter
took
no
such
trouble
she
sat
as
grave
as
a
young
judge
never
moving
a
muscle
the
dog
however
held
in
her
arms
and
not
at
all
comfortable
then
making
prodigious
efforts
to
struggle
on
to
its
mistress
more
commodious
lap
burst
out
into
a
responsive
bark
as
shrill
and
not
much
unlike
darling
toto
said
lady
mariamne
come
it
always
knows
what
it
mummy
means
did
you
ever
see
such
a
darling
little
head
mr
tatham
and
the
faithful
pet
always
laughs
when
i
laugh
what
was
i
talking
of
st
serf
and
his
ladies
well
it
is
not
much
wonder
you
know
is
it
for
he
has
always
been
a
sort
of
an
invalid
and
he
will
never
marry
now
and
poor
hal
being
gone
there
only
phil
phil
been
going
a
pace
tatham
but
he
has
had
a
bad
illness
too
and
the
other
boys
going
has
sobered
him
a
bit
and
i
do
believe
that
he
probably
mend
and
there
he
is
you
know
tied
to
a
oh
of
course
is
as
right
as
a
as
right
as
a
trivet
whatever
that
may
be
those
sort
of
heartless
people
always
are
and
then
there
the
child
is
it
living
mr
tatham
that
what
i
want
to
know
philip
is
alive
and
well
lady
mariamne
if
that
is
what
you
want
to
know
philip
she
called
him
after
phil
after
all
well
that
is
something
wonderful
i
expected
to
hear
he
was
john
or
jonathan
or
something
now
where
is
he
said
lady
mariamne
with
the
most
insinuating
air
john
burst
into
a
short
laugh
i
do
suppose
you
expect
me
to
tell
you
he
said
why
not
you
ca
hide
a
boy
that
is
heir
to
a
peerage
mr
tatham
it
is
impossible
nell
has
done
the
best
she
could
in
that
way
they
know
nothing
about
her
in
that
awful
place
she
was
married
from
of
course
you
remember
it
a
dreadful
place
enough
to
make
one
commit
suicide
do
you
know
the
cottage
or
whatever
they
call
it
is
let
and
nobody
knows
anything
about
them
i
took
the
trouble
to
go
there
i
assure
you
on
my
own
hook
to
see
if
i
could
find
out
something
toto
nearly
died
of
it
did
you
darling
not
a
drop
of
cream
to
be
had
for
him
the
poor
angel
only
a
little
nasty
skim
milk
but
tatham
has
the
barbarity
to
smile
she
went
on
with
a
shrill
outcry
fancy
toto
the
cruelty
to
smile
no
cream
for
the
angel
and
no
information
for
his
mistress
said
john
you
horrid
cruel
man
and
you
sit
there
at
your
ease
and
will
do
nothing
for
us
should
you
like
me
said
john
to
send
out
for
cream
for
your
dog
lady
mariamne
cream
in
the
temple
said
the
lady
what
sort
of
a
compound
would
it
be
dolly
all
plaster
of
paris
or
stuff
of
that
sort
perhaps
you
have
tea
sometimes
in
these
parts
very
seldom
said
john
but
it
might
be
obtainable
if
you
would
like
it
he
put
forward
his
hand
but
not
with
much
alacrity
to
the
bell
mother
never
takes
any
tea
said
miss
dolly
hastily
she
only
crumbles
down
cake
into
it
for
that
little
brute
it
is
you
who
are
a
little
brute
you
unnatural
child
toto
likes
his
tea
very
much
he
is
dying
for
it
but
you
must
have
patience
my
pet
for
probably
it
would
be
very
bad
and
the
cream
all
stucco
or
something
tatham
do
tell
us
what
has
become
of
nell
now
have
you
hidden
her
somewhere
in
london
john
wood
and
that
sort
of
thing
do
you
know
or
where
is
she
is
the
old
woman
living
and
how
has
that
boy
been
brought
up
at
a
dame
school
or
something
of
that
sort
i
suppose
mother
said
dolly
you
ought
to
know
there
are
now
no
schools
there
board
schools
which
is
what
you
mean
i
suppose
and
it
would
be
very
good
for
him
if
he
had
been
there
they
would
teach
him
a
great
deal
more
than
was
ever
taught
to
uncle
phil
teach
him
said
lady
mariamne
with
another
shriek
did
i
ask
anything
about
teaching
heaven
forbid
tatham
knows
what
i
mean
dolly
has
he
been
at
any
decent
place
or
has
he
been
where
it
will
never
be
heard
of
eton
and
harrow
one
knows
and
the
dame
schools
one
knows
but
horrible
board
schools
or
things
where
they
might
say
young
lord
lomond
was
brought
up
oh
goodness
gracious
one
has
to
bear
a
great
many
things
but
i
could
not
bear
that
it
does
not
matter
much
does
it
so
long
as
he
does
not
come
within
the
range
of
his
nearest
relations
this
was
from
john
who
was
almost
at
the
end
of
his
patience
he
began
to
put
his
papers
back
in
a
portfolio
with
the
intention
of
carrying
them
home
with
him
for
his
hour
work
had
been
spoilt
as
well
as
his
temper
i
am
afraid
he
added
that
i
can
not
give
you
any
information
lady
mariamne
oh
such
nonsense
mr
tatham
as
if
the
heir
to
a
peerage
could
be
hid
it
was
not
often
that
lady
mariamne
produced
an
unanswerable
effect
but
against
this
last
sentence
of
hers
john
had
absolutely
nothing
to
say
he
stared
at
her
for
a
moment
and
then
he
returned
to
his
papers
shovelling
them
into
the
portfolio
with
vehemence
fortunately
she
did
not
herself
see
how
potent
was
her
argument
she
went
on
diluting
it
till
it
lost
all
its
power
there
is
the
if
it
was
nothing
else
they
must
have
the
right
particulars
for
that
why
dolly
is
at
full
length
in
it
her
age
and
all
poor
child
and
toto
too
for
anything
i
know
is
du
in
the
dear
toto
darling
and
yet
toto
ca
succeed
nor
dolly
either
and
this
year
phil
will
be
in
as
heir
presumptive
and
his
marriage
and
all
and
then
a
blank
line
it
ridiculous
it
horrible
it
a
thing
that
ca
ca
be
only
think
of
all
the
troops
of
people
nice
people
the
best
people
that
read
the
mr
tatham
and
that
know
phil
is
married
and
that
there
is
a
child
and
yet
will
see
nothing
but
that
blank
line
nell
was
always
a
little
fool
and
never
could
see
things
in
a
way
but
a
man
ought
to
know
better
and
a
lawyer
with
chambers
in
the
temple
why
people
come
and
consult
you
on
such
matters
i
might
be
coming
to
ask
you
to
send
out
detectives
and
that
sort
of
thing
how
do
you
dare
to
hide
away
that
boy
lady
mariamne
stamped
her
foot
at
john
but
this
proceeding
very
much
incommoded
toto
who
disturbed
in
his
position
on
her
knee
got
upon
his
feet
and
began
to
bark
furiously
first
at
his
mistress
and
then
following
her
impulse
at
the
gentleman
opposite
to
her
backing
against
the
lady
shoulder
and
setting
up
his
little
nose
furiously
with
vibrations
of
rage
against
john
while
stumbling
upon
the
uncertain
footing
of
the
lap
volcanically
shaken
by
the
movement
the
result
of
this
onslaught
was
to
send
lady
mariamne
into
shrieks
of
laughter
in
the
midst
of
which
she
half
smothered
toto
with
mingled
endearments
and
attempts
at
restraint
until
dolly
coming
to
the
rescue
seized
him
summarily
and
snatched
him
away
the
darling
cried
lady
mariamne

sees
it
and

to
make

dear

john
she
held
up
a
finger
at
him
with
the
engaging
playfulness
of
old
how

your
dear
lady

must
tell
me
all
about
the
boy
chapter
xxxv
to
tell
her
all
about
the
boy
john
tatham
shovelled
his
papers
into
his
portfolio
and
shut
it
up
with
a
snap
of
embarrassment
a
sort
of
confession
of
weakness
he
pushed
back
his
chair
with
the
same
sharpness
almost
making
a
noise
upon
the
old
turkey
carpet
and
he
touched
his
bell
so
that
it
sounded
with
a
shrill
electric
ping
almost
like
a
simmons
understood
all
these
signs
and
he
was
very
sympathetic
when
he
came
in
to
take
tatham
last
orders
and
help
him
on
with
his
coat
spoilt
your
evening
work
said
simmons
compassionately
i
knew
they
would
ladies
never
should
enter
a
gentleman
chambers
if
i
could
help
it
they
got
nothing
to
do
in
the
temple
you
forget
some
men
in
the
temple
are
married
simmons
what
does
that
matter
said
the
clerk
let
see
their
wives
at
home
sir
what
i
will
maintain
is
that
ladies
have
no
business
here
this
was
a
little
ungrateful
it
must
be
said
for
simmons
probably
got
off
of
an
hour
earlier
than
he
would
have
done
had
tatham
remained
undisturbed
as
it
was
john
had
some
ten
minutes
to
wait
before
his
habitual
hansom
drew
up
at
the
door
it
was
not
the
first
time
by
many
times
that
tatham
had
considered
the
question
which
he
now
took
with
him
into
his
hansom
and
which
occupied
him
more
or
less
all
the
way
to
halkin
street
lady
mariamne
however
had
put
it
very
neatly
and
very
conclusively
when
she
said
that
you
ca
hide
the
heir
to
a
peerage
more
concisely
at
least
than
john
had
himself
put
it
in
his
many
thoughts
on
the
subject
for
to
tell
the
truth
john
had
never
considered
the
boy
in
this
aspect
that
he
should
ever
be
the
heir
to
a
peerage
had
seemed
one
of
those
possibilities
which
so
outrage
nature
and
are
so
very
like
fiction
that
the
sober
mind
rejects
them
with
almost
a
fling
of
impatience
and
yet
how
often
they
come
true
he
had
never
heard
a
fact
of
which
he
felt
partly
ashamed
for
it
was
an
event
of
too
much
importance
to
be
ignored
by
any
one
connected
with
elinor
of
hal
compton
death
john
was
not
acquainted
with
hal
compton
any
more
than
he
was
with
other
men
who
come
and
go
in
society
occasionally
seen
but
open
to
no
particular
remark
a
son
of
lord
serf
the
best
of
the
lot
a
compton
with
very
little
against
him
these
were
things
which
he
had
heard
said
and
had
taken
little
notice
of
hal
was
healthier
less
objectionable
a
better
life
than
phil
and
yet
hal
was
gone
who
ought
by
all
rights
to
have
succeeded
his
invalid
brother
it
was
true
that
the
invalid
brother
who
had
seen
the
end
of
two
vigorous
men
might
also
see
out
phil
but
that
would
make
little
difference
in
the
position
unless
indeed
by
modifying
elinor
feelings
and
removing
her
reluctance
to
make
her
boy
known
john
shook
his
head
as
he
went
on
with
his
thoughts
and
decided
within
himself
that
this
was
the
very
reason
why
phil
compton
should
survive
and
become
lord
serf
and
make
the
imbroglio
worse
if
worse
were
possible
it
had
not
required
this
to
make
it
a
hideous
imbroglio
the
most
foolish
and
wanton
that
ever
a
woman
made
he
wondered
at
himself
when
he
thought
of
it
how
he
had
ever
consented
to
it
ever
permitted
such
a
state
of
affairs
and
yet
what
could
he
have
done
he
had
no
right
to
interfere
even
in
the
way
of
advice
which
he
had
given
until
everybody
was
sick
of
him
and
his
counsels
he
could
not
have
betrayed
his
cousin
to
tell
her
that
she
was
conducting
her
affairs
very
foolishly
laying
up
untold
troubles
for
herself
was
what
he
had
done
freely
going
to
the
very
edge
of
a
breach
and
he
had
no
right
to
do
any
more
he
could
not
force
her
to
adopt
his
method
neither
could
he
betray
her
when
she
took
her
own
way
nevertheless
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
john
felt
himself
almost
an
accomplice
involved
in
this
unwise
folly
with
a
sort
of
responsibility
for
it
and
almost
guilt
it
did
not
indeed
change
young
philip
moral
position
in
any
way
or
make
the
discovery
that
he
had
a
father
living
more
likely
to
shock
and
bewilder
him
that
this
discovery
should
come
mingled
with
many
extraneous
wonders
and
yet
these
facts
did
alter
the
circumstances
you
can
not
hide
the
heir
to
a
peerage
lady
mariamne
was
far
very
far
from
being
a
philosopher
or
a
person
of
genius
and
yet
this
which
she
had
said
was
in
reality
quite
unanswerable
phil
compton
might
have
been
ignored
for
ever
by
his
wife
and
child
had
he
remained
only
the
phil
a
younger
son
and
a
nobody
but
phil
compton
as
lord
serf
could
not
be
ignored
elinor
had
been
wise
enough
never
to
change
her
name
that
is
to
say
she
had
been
too
proud
to
do
so
though
nobody
knew
of
the
existence
of
that
prefix
which
was
so
inappropriate
to
her
husband
character
but
now
compton
would
no
longer
be
her
name
and
philip
the
boy
at
the
big
northern
would
be
lord
lomond
an
summons
like
this
has
sometimes
the
power
of
turning
the
heads
of
the
heirs
so
suddenly
ennobled
but
it
did
anything
but
convey
elation
to
john
mind
in
the
prospect
of
its
effect
upon
his
relations
would
she
see
reason
would
she
be
brought
to
allow
that
something
must
be
done
or
would
she
remain
obdurate
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
a
great
impatience
with
elinor
filled
john
mind
she
was
as
the
reader
knows
the
only
woman
to
john
tatham
but
what
does
that
matter
he
did
not
approve
of
her
any
more
on
that
account
he
was
even
more
conscious
of
the
faults
of
which
she
was
guilty
he
was
aware
of
her
obstinacy
her
determined
adherence
to
her
own
way
as
no
other
man
in
the
world
was
would
she
acknowledge
now
at
last
that
she
was
wrong
and
give
in
i
am
obliged
to
confess
that
the
giving
in
of
elinor
was
the
last
spectacle
in
heaven
or
earth
which
john
tatham
could
conceive
he
went
over
these
circumstances
as
he
drove
through
all
of
london
that
is
to
some
people
worth
calling
london
on
that
dark
january
night
passing
from
the
light
of
the
busy
streets
into
the
comparative
darkness
of
those
in
which
people
live
without
in
the
least
remarking
where
he
was
going
except
in
his
thoughts
he
had
not
the
least
intention
of
accepting
the
invitation
of
lady
mariamne
nor
did
his
mind
dwell
upon
her
or
the
change
that
age
had
wrought
in
her
but
yet
the
compton
family
had
gained
an
interest
in
john
eyes
which
it
did
not
possess
even
at
the
time
when
elinor
marriage
first
brought
its
name
into
his
thoughts
philip
young
philip
the
boy
as
john
called
him
in
his
own
mind
in
fond
identification
was
as
near
john
own
child
as
anything
ever
could
be
in
this
world
he
had
many
nephews
and
nieces
belonging
to
him
by
a
more
authentic
title
but
none
of
these
was
in
the
least
like
philip
whom
none
of
all
the
kindred
knew
but
himself
and
who
so
far
as
he
was
aware
had
but
one
kinsman
in
the
world
who
was
uncle
john
he
had
followed
the
development
of
the
boy
mind
always
with
a
reference
to
those
facts
of
which
philip
knew
nothing
which
would
be
so
wonderful
to
him
when
the
revelation
came
to
john
that
little
world
at
lakeside
where
the
ladies
had
made
an
artificial
existence
for
themselves
which
was
at
the
same
time
so
natural
so
sweet
so
full
of
all
the
humanities
and
charities
was
something
like
what
we
might
suppose
this
erring
world
to
be
to
some
archangel
great
enough
to
see
how
everything
is
not
great
enough
to
give
the
impulse
that
would
put
it
right
if
the
great
celestial
intelligences
are
allowed
to
know
and
mark
out
perverse
human
ways
how
much
impatience
with
us
must
mingle
with
their
tenderness
and
pity
john
tatham
had
little
perhaps
that
was
heavenly
about
him
but
he
loved
elinor
and
her
son
and
was
absolutely
free
of
selfishness
in
respect
to
them
never
he
was
aware
could
either
woman
or
child
be
more
to
him
than
they
were
now
nay
they
were
everything
to
him
but
on
their
own
account
not
his
he
desired
their
welfare
absolutely
and
not
his
own
through
them
elinor
was
capable
at
any
moment
of
turning
upon
him
of
saying
if
not
in
words
yet
in
undeniable
inference
what
is
it
to
you
and
the
boy
though
he
gladly
referred
to
uncle
john
when
uncle
john
was
in
the
way
took
him
with
perfect
composure
as
a
being
apart
from
his
life
they
were
everything
to
him
but
he
was
nothing
to
them
his
whole
heart
was
set
upon
their
peace
upon
their
comfort
and
but
as
much
apart
from
himself
as
if
he
had
not
been
tatham
was
dining
out
that
night
which
was
a
good
thing
for
him
to
distract
his
thoughts
from
this
problem
which
he
could
only
torment
himself
about
and
could
not
solve
and
there
was
an
evening
party
at
the
same
house
one
of
those
quieter
parties
which
are
people
in
london
tell
you
so
much
more
agreeable
than
in
the
crowd
of
the
season
it
was
a
curious
kind
of
coincidence
that
at
this
little
assembly
which
might
have
been
thought
not
at
all
in
her
way
he
met
lady
mariamne
accompanied
by
her
daughter
again
it
was
not
in
her
way
being
a
judge
house
where
frivolity
though
it
had
a
certain
place
was
not
the
first
element
but
then
when
there
are
few
things
to
choose
from
people
must
not
be
too
particular
and
those
who
can
not
have
society
absolutely
of
their
own
choosing
are
bound
as
in
other
cases
of
necessity
to
take
what
they
can
get
and
then
dolly
liked
to
hear
people
talking
of
things
which
she
did
not
understand
when
lady
mariamne
saw
that
john
tatham
was
there
she
gave
a
little
shriek
of
satisfaction
and
rushed
at
him
as
if
they
had
been
the
dearest
friends
in
the
world
so
delighted
to
see
you
she
cried
giving
everybody
around
the
idea
of
the
most
intimate
relationship
it
was
the
most
wonderful
good
fortune
that
i
got
my
toto
home
in
safety
poor
darling
for
you
know
tatham
you
would
not
give
him
any
tea
and
dolly
who
is
quite
unnatural
pitched
him
into
the
carriage
and
simply
sat
upon
him
sat
upon
him
tatham
before
i
could
interfere
oh
you
do
not
know
half
the
trials
a
woman
has
to
go
through
and
now
please
take
me
to
have
some
coffee
or
something
and
let
us
finish
the
conversation
we
were
having
when
dolly
made
me
go
away
john
could
not
refuse
his
arm
nor
his
services
in
respect
to
the
coffee
but
he
was
mute
on
the
subject
on
which
his
companion
was
bent
he
tried
to
divert
her
attention
by
some
questions
on
the
subject
of
dolly
instead
dolly
oh
yes
she
a
girl
of
the
period
do
you
know
not
what
a
girl
of
the
period
used
to
be
in
day
tatham
when
those
nasty
newspaper
people
wrote
us
down
look
at
her
talking
to
those
two
men
and
laying
down
the
law
now
we
never
laid
down
the
law
we
knew
best
about
things
in
our
sphere
dress
and
the
and
what
people
were
doing
in
society
but
dolly
would
tell
you
how
to
manage
your
next
great
case
tatham
or
she
could
give
one
of
those
a
wrinkle
about
cutting
off
a
leg
gracious
i
should
have
fainted
only
to
hear
of
such
a
thing
tell
me
are
those
supposed
to
be
in
society
lady
mariamne
cried
putting
up
her
thin
shoulder
which
was
far
too
like
a
specimen
of
anatomy
in
the
direction
of
a
famous
physician
who
was
blandly
smiling
upon
the
instruction
which
miss
dolly
assuredly
intended
to
convey
as
much
as
are
in
society
replied
john
oh
tatham
such
nonsense
lawyers
have
always
been
in
society
what
are
the
attorney
general
and
lord
chancellor
and
so
forth
they
are
all
lawyers
but
i
never
heard
of
a
doctor
that
was
in
the
cabinet
which
makes
all
the
difference
here
is
a
quiet
corner
where
nobody
can
disturb
us
sit
down
it
will
be
for
all
the
world
like
sitting
out
a
dance
together
and
tell
me
about
nell
and
her
boy
and
what
if
i
have
nothing
to
tell
said
john
who
did
not
feel
at
all
like
sitting
out
a
dance
but
on
the
contrary
was
much
more
upright
and
perpendicular
than
even
a
queen
counsel
of
fifty
has
any
need
to
be
oh
sit
down
i
never
could
bear
a
man
standing
over
me
as
if
he
had
swallowed
a
poker
why
did
she
go
off
and
leave
phil
where
did
she
go
to
i
told
you
i
went
off
on
my
own
hook
to
that
horrid
place
where
they
lived
and
knocked
up
the
old
clergyman
and
the
woman
who
wanted
me
to
put
on
a
shawl
over
one
of
the
prettiest
gowns
i
ever
had
fancy
the
vandal
but
they
knew
nothing
at
all
of
her
there
where
is
nell
tatham
you
do
pretend
not
to
know
and
the
boy
why
he
must
be
about
eighteen
and
if
serf
were
to
die
tatham
you
know
it
is
quite
quite
intolerable
and
not
to
be
borne
i
do
know
what
steps
phil
has
taken
he
has
been
awfully
good
he
has
never
said
a
word
to
hear
him
you
would
think
she
was
far
too
nice
to
be
mixed
up
with
a
set
of
people
like
us
but
now
you
know
he
must
be
got
hold
of
he
must
he
must
why
he
be
lomond
if
serf
were
to
die
and
everybody
would
be
crying
out
the
heir
after
phil
the
bagley
comptons
and
they
would
set
up
for
being
heirs
presumptive
unless
you
can
produce
that
boy
but
the
boy
is
not
mine
that
i
should
produce
him
said
john
oh
tatham
when
nell
is
your
relation
and
always
always
was
advised
by
you
you
may
tell
that
to
the
marines
or
anybody
that
will
believe
it
you
need
not
think
you
can
take
me
in
i
hope
not
to
take
in
anybody
if
being
advised
by
me
means
persistently
declining
to
do
what
i
suggest
and
recommend
oh
then
you
are
of
the
same
opinion
as
i
am
said
lady
mariamne
bravo
now
we
shall
manage
something
if
you
had
been
like
that
years
ago
when
i
used
to
go
to
you
do
you
remember
to
beg
you
to
smooth
things
down
but
you
would
never
see
it
till
the
smash
came
i
wish
said
john
not
without
a
little
bitterness
that
i
could
persuade
you
how
little
influence
i
have
there
are
some
women
i
suppose
who
take
advice
when
it
is
given
to
them
but
the
women
whom
i
have
ever
had
anything
to
do
with
i
am
sorry
to
say
i
promise
cried
lady
mariamne
putting
her
hands
and
rings
together
in
an
attitude
of
supplication
to
do
what
you
tell
me
faithfully
if
you
advise
me
where
i
find
the
boy
oh
let
nell
alone
if
you
want
to
keep
her
to
yourself
i
spoil
sport
tatham
i
promise
you
she
cried
with
her
shrill
laugh
only
tell
me
where
i
find
the
boy
what
is
it
you
want
dolly
coming
after
me
like
a
policeman
do
you
see
i
am
busy
we
are
sitting
out
the
dance
tatham
and
i
dolly
did
not
join
in
her
mother
laugh
nor
unbend
in
the
least
as
there
is
no
dancing
she
said
and
everybody
is
going
i
thought
you
would
prefer
to
go
too
but
we
shall
see
you
tatham
now
i
can
not
take
any
refusal
you
must
come
if
it
were
only
for
toto
sake
and
dolly
will
go
out
i
hope
on
one
of
her
great
works
and
will
not
come
to
disturb
us
just
when
i
have
persuaded
you
to
speak
for
you
were
just
going
to
open
your
mouth
now
you
know
you
were
five
tatham
whatever
happens
now
remember
and
you
are
to
tell
me
everything
she
held
up
her
finger
to
him
half
threatening
half
coaxing
and
then
with
a
peal
of
laughter
yielded
to
dolly
and
was
taken
away
i
did
not
know
tatham
said
the
judge
who
was
his
host
that
you
were
on
terms
of
such
friendship
with
lady
mariamne
nor
did
i
said
john
tatham
with
a
yawn
queer
thing
this
is
about
that
old
business
in
which
her
brother
was
mixed
up
have
you
heard
one
of
those
companies
that
came
to
smash
somewhere
about
twenty
years
ago
the
manager
absconded
and
there
was
something
queer
about
the
books
well
the
fellow
the
manager
has
been
caught
at
last
and
there
will
be
a
trial
it
in
your
way
you
will
be
offered
a
brief
no
doubt
with
refreshers
every
day
you
lucky
fellow
i
have
just
as
much
trouble
and
no
refreshers
what
a
fool
a
man
is
tatham
ever
to
change
the
bar
for
the
bench
do
you
do
it
my
dear
fellow
take
a
man
advice
who
knows
at
least
i
shall
wait
till
i
am
asked
said
john
oh
you
will
be
asked
sooner
or
later
but
do
do
it
take
example
by
those
who
have
gone
before
you
said
the
great
functionary
shaking
his
learned
head
and
the
judge
wife
had
also
a
word
to
say
tatham
she
said
as
he
took
his
leave
i
know
now
what
i
have
to
do
when
i
want
to
secure
lady
mariamne
i
shall
ask
you
do
you
often
want
to
secure
lady
mariamne
said
john
oh
it
is
all
very
well
to
look
as
if
you
did
care
she
is
perhaps
a
little
but
still
a
great
many
people
think
her
charming
is
there
a
family
connection
lady
wigsby
said
with
a
curiosity
which
she
tried
not
to
make
too
apparent
for
she
was
acquainted
with
the
ways
of
the
profession
and
knew
that
was
the
last
thing
likely
to
procure
her
the
information
she
sought
it
can
not
be
called
a
connection
there
was
a
marriage
which
turned
out
badly
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
tatham
if
the
question
was
indiscreet
i
hear
lord
serf
is
worse
again
and
not
likely
to
last
long
and
there
is
some
strange
story
about
a
lost
heir
lady
wigsby
john
replied
and
he
added
confound
lord
serf
under
his
breath
as
he
went
but
it
was
not
lord
serf
poor
man
who
had
done
him
no
harm
whom
john
wished
to
be
confounded
because
at
last
after
many
threatenings
he
was
about
to
be
so
as
to
die
it
was
some
one
very
different
it
was
the
woman
who
for
much
more
than
twenty
years
had
been
the
chief
object
of
john
tatham
thoughts
chapter
xxxvi
things
relapsed
into
quietness
for
some
time
after
that
combination
which
seemed
to
be
directed
against
john
peace
of
mind
if
i
said
that
it
is
not
unusual
for
the
current
of
events
to
run
very
quietly
before
a
great
crisis
i
should
not
be
saying
anything
original
since
the
torrent
calmness
ere
it
dash
below
has
been
remarked
before
now
but
it
certainly
was
so
in
this
instance
john
i
need
scarcely
say
did
not
present
himself
at
lady
mariamne
on
the
afternoon
at
five
when
he
was
expected
he
wrote
a
very
civil
note
to
say
that
he
was
unable
to
come
and
still
less
able
to
give
the
information
her
ladyship
required
and
to
tell
the
truth
in
his
alarm
lest
lady
mariamne
should
repeat
her
invasion
tatham
was
guilty
of
concerting
with
his
clerk
the
excellent
simmons
various
means
of
eluding
such
a
danger
and
he
exercised
the
greatest
circumspection
in
regard
to
his
own
invitations
and
went
nowhere
where
there
was
the
least
danger
of
meeting
her
in
this
way
for
a
few
months
he
had
kept
himself
safe
it
may
be
imagined
then
how
great
was
his
annoyance
when
simmons
came
in
again
very
diffident
coughing
behind
his
hand
and
taking
shelter
in
the
shaded
part
of
the
room
with
the
hesitating
statement
that
a
lady
who
would
take
no
denial
who
looked
as
if
she
knew
the
chambers
as
well
as
he
did
and
could
hardly
be
kept
from
walking
straight
in
was
waiting
to
see
tatham
john
sprang
to
his
feet
with
words
which
were
not
benedictions
i
thought
he
said
you
ass
that
you
knew
exactly
what
to
say
but
sir
said
simmons
it
is
not
the
same
lady
it
is
not
at
all
the
same
lady
it
is
a
lady
who
but
here
the
question
was
summarily
settled
for
the
door
was
pushed
open
though
simmons
still
held
it
with
his
hand
and
a
voice
which
was
more
like
the
voice
of
elinor
dennistoun
at
eighteen
than
that
of
compton
said
quickly
i
know
john
that
your
door
ca
be
shut
for
me
elinor
he
said
getting
up
from
his
chair
i
know
she
repeated
that
there
must
be
some
mistake
that
your
door
could
not
be
shut
for
me
no
of
course
not
he
said
it
is
all
right
simmons
but
who
could
have
thought
of
seeing
you
here
it
was
a
contingency
i
never
anticipated
when
did
you
come
where
are
you
staying
is
philip
with
you
he
overwhelmed
her
with
questions
perhaps
by
way
of
stopping
her
mouth
lest
she
should
put
questions
still
more
difficult
to
answer
to
himself
let
me
take
breath
a
little
she
said
i
scarcely
have
taken
breath
since
the
thing
happened
which
has
brought
me
here
but
i
feel
a
little
confidence
now
with
the
strong
backing
i
have
in
you
john
my
dear
elinor
he
said
i
am
afraid
you
must
not
look
for
any
strong
backing
in
me
why
she
cried
have
you
judged
it
all
beforehand
and
do
you
know
are
you
quite
quite
sure
john
that
i
can
not
avoid
it
in
any
way
that
i
am
obliged
at
all
costs
to
appear
i
would
rather
fly
the
country
i
would
rather
leave
lakeside
altogether
and
settle
abroad
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
that
i
would
not
rather
do
elinor
said
john
with
some
sternness
you
can
not
believe
that
i
would
oppose
you
in
any
possible
thing
your
pleasure
has
been
a
law
to
me
i
may
have
differed
with
you
but
i
have
never
made
any
difference
john
you
do
not
mean
to
say
she
cried
turning
pale
that
you
are
going
to
abandon
me
now
of
course
that
is
merely
a
figure
of
speech
he
said
how
could
i
abandon
you
but
it
is
quite
true
what
that
woman
says
and
i
entirely
agree
with
her
and
not
with
you
in
this
respect
that
the
heir
to
a
peerage
can
not
be
hid
the
heir
to
a
peerage
she
faltered
looking
at
him
astonished
gradually
a
sort
of
slowly
growing
light
seemed
to
diffuse
itself
over
her
face
the
heir
to
a
peerage
john
i
do
know
what
you
mean
is
this
not
your
reason
for
coming
to
town
there
is
nothing
that
i
know
of
about
the
heir
to
a
peerage
who
is
this
heir
to
a
peerage
i
do
know
what
you
mean
but
you
frighten
me
is
that
a
reason
why
i
should
be
dragged
out
of
my
seclusion
and
made
to
appear
in
his
defence
oh
no
surely
no
if
he
is
they
will
let
him
off
they
will
not
press
it
i
shall
not
be
wanted
john
the
more
reason
that
you
should
stand
by
me
we
are
at
elinor
what
has
brought
you
to
london
let
me
know
on
your
side
and
then
i
shall
understand
what
i
have
got
to
do
has
brought
me
to
london
she
handed
him
a
piece
of
paper
which
john
knew
very
well
the
appearance
of
he
understood
it
better
than
she
did
and
he
was
not
afraid
of
it
which
she
was
but
he
opened
it
all
the
same
with
a
great
deal
of
surprise
it
was
a
subpoena
charging
elinor
compton
to
appear
and
bear
testimony
in
the
case
of
the
versus
the
versus
what
have
you
got
to
do
with
such
a
case
you
elinor
of
all
people
in
the
world
oh
he
said
suddenly
as
a
light
but
a
dim
one
began
to
break
upon
him
it
was
the
case
of
which
his
friend
the
judge
had
spoken
and
in
which
he
had
been
offered
a
retainer
as
a
matter
of
fact
shortly
after
that
talk
he
had
been
obliged
to
refuse
his
time
being
already
fully
taken
up
and
he
had
not
looked
into
the
case
but
now
it
began
slowly
to
dawn
upon
him
that
the
trial
was
that
of
the
once
absconded
manager
of
a
certain
company
and
that
this
was
precisely
the
company
in
which
elinor
money
had
been
all
but
invested
by
her
husband
it
might
be
upon
that
subject
that
she
had
to
appear
well
he
said
i
can
imagine
a
possible
reason
why
you
should
be
called
and
yet
not
a
good
one
for
it
was
not
of
course
you
who
were
acting
but
your
husband
for
you
it
is
he
that
should
appear
and
not
you
oh
john
she
cried
oh
john
wringing
her
hands
she
had
followed
his
looks
eagerly
noticing
the
light
that
seemed
to
dawn
over
his
face
with
a
strange
anxiety
and
keen
interest
but
john
it
was
evident
had
not
got
the
clue
which
she
expected
and
her
face
changed
into
impatience
disappointment
exasperation
you
have
not
heard
anything
about
it
she
said
you
do
know
it
was
brought
to
me
he
said
but
i
could
not
take
it
up
no
i
do
know
except
that
it
curious
from
the
lapse
of
time
twenty
years
or
thereabouts
that
all
i
know
the
question
is
she
said
about
a
date
there
were
some
books
destroyed
and
it
is
not
known
who
did
it
suspicion
fell
upon
one
who
might
have
been
guilty
but
that
on
that
day
he
arrived
at
the
house
of
the
girl
whom
he
was
going
to
marry
and
consequently
could
not
have
been
there
elinor
yes
she
said
that
is
what
i
am
wanted
for
john
an
excellent
reason
after
all
these
years
i
must
appear
to
clear
my
husband
and
that
is
how
pippo
will
find
out
that
i
have
a
husband
and
he
a
father
oh
john
john
support
me
with
your
approval
and
help
me
oh
help
me
to
go
away
good
gracious
was
all
that
john
could
say
i
should
have
gone
first
and
asked
you
after
she
cried
for
you
are
a
lawyer
and
i
suppose
you
will
think
you
must
not
advise
any
one
to
fly
in
the
face
of
the
law
and
i
do
even
know
whether
it
will
be
of
any
use
to
fly
will
they
have
it
in
the
papers
all
the
same
will
they
put
it
in
that
his
wife
refused
to
appear
on
his
behalf
that
she
had
gone
away
to
avoid
the
summons
will
it
be
all
there
for
pippo
to
guess
and
wonder
at
the
name
and
come
to
me
with
questions
mother
who
is
this
and
mother
what
is
that
john
ca
you
answer
me
you
that
i
came
to
to
guide
me
to
tell
me
what
i
must
do
have
you
nothing
nothing
to
say
i
am
too
much
bewildered
to
know
what
i
am
doing
elinor
this
is
all
sprung
upon
me
like
a
mine
and
there
was
plenty
before
there
was
nothing
before
she
cried
indignantly
it
was
all
plain
sailing
before
he
knew
nothing
of
family
troubles
how
should
he
poor
child
being
so
young
that
was
simple
enough
and
i
think
i
see
a
way
still
john
i
will
take
him
off
at
easter
for
a
trip
abroad
and
when
we
have
started
to
go
to
switzerland
or
somewhere
i
will
change
my
mind
and
make
him
think
of
greece
or
somewhere
far
far
away
the
east
where
there
will
be
no
newspapers
tell
me
when
the
trial
will
come
on
and
how
long
you
think
it
will
last
and
i
will
keep
him
away
till
it
is
all
over
john
you
have
nothing
surely
to
say
against
that
think
from
how
much
it
will
save
the
boy
it
is
impossible
elinor
that
the
boy
can
be
saved
i
never
knew
of
this
complication
but
there
are
other
circumstances
of
which
i
have
lately
heard
what
can
any
other
circumstances
have
to
do
with
it
john
even
if
he
must
hear
i
know
i
know
you
have
always
been
determined
upon
that
is
that
the
way
you
would
have
him
hear
not
only
that
he
has
a
father
but
that
his
father
was
involved
in
in
transactions
like
that
before
ever
he
was
born
elinor
let
us
understand
each
other
said
tatham
you
mean
that
you
have
it
in
your
power
to
exonerate
your
husband
and
he
has
had
you
subpoenaed
knowing
this
she
looked
at
him
with
a
look
which
he
could
not
fathom
was
it
reluctance
to
save
phil
compton
that
was
in
elinor
eyes
was
she
ready
to
leave
her
husband
to
destruction
when
she
could
prevent
it
in
order
to
save
her
boy
from
the
knowledge
of
his
existence
john
tatham
was
horrified
by
the
look
she
fixed
upon
him
though
he
could
not
read
it
he
thought
he
could
read
it
and
read
it
that
way
in
the
way
of
hate
and
deliberate
preference
of
her
own
will
to
all
law
and
justice
there
could
be
no
such
tremendous
testimony
to
the
power
of
that
long
continued
visionary
love
which
john
tatham
bore
to
elinor
than
that
this
discovery
which
he
thought
he
had
made
did
not
destroy
it
he
was
greatly
shocked
but
it
made
no
difference
in
his
feelings
perhaps
there
was
more
of
the
brotherly
character
in
them
than
he
thought
for
a
moment
they
looked
at
each
other
and
he
thought
he
made
this
discovery
while
she
met
his
eyes
with
that
look
which
she
did
not
know
was
inscrutable
which
she
feared
was
full
of
i
believe
she
said
bending
her
head
that
that
is
what
he
thinks
if
it
had
been
me
said
john
tatham
moved
out
of
his
habitual
calm
i
would
rather
be
proved
guilty
of
anything
than
owe
my
safety
to
such
an
expedient
as
that
drag
in
a
woman
who
hates
me
to
prove
my
alibi
as
if
she
loved
me
by
jove
elinor
you
women
have
the
gift
of
drawing
out
everything
that
worst
in
men
it
seems
to
make
you
hate
me
john
which
i
do
think
i
have
deserved
oh
no
i
do
hate
you
it
a
consequence
i
suppose
of
use
and
wont
it
makes
little
difference
to
me
she
gave
him
another
look
which
he
did
not
understand
a
wistful
look
appealing
to
something
he
did
not
know
what
to
his
ridiculous
partiality
he
thought
and
that
stubborn
domestic
affection
to
which
it
was
of
so
little
importance
what
she
did
as
long
as
she
was
elinor
and
then
she
said
with
a
woman
soft
endless
pertinacity
then
you
think
i
may
go
he
sprang
from
his
seat
with
that
impatient
despair
which
is
equally
characteristic
of
the
man
go
he
said
when
you
are
called
upon
by
law
to
vindicate
a
man
character
and
that
man
your
husband
i
ought
not
to
be
surprised
at
anything
with
my
experience
but
elinor
you
take
away
my
breath
she
only
smiled
giving
him
once
more
that
look
of
appeal
how
can
you
think
of
it
he
said
the
subpoena
is
enough
to
keep
any
reasonable
being
besides
the
other
motive
you
must
not
budge
i
should
feel
my
own
character
involved
as
well
as
yours
if
after
consulting
me
on
the
subject
you
were
guilty
of
an
evasion
after
all
it
would
not
be
your
fault
john
elinor
you
are
mad
it
must
not
be
done
he
cried
do
defy
me
i
am
capable
of
informing
upon
you
and
having
you
stopped
by
force
if
you
do
not
give
this
idea
up
by
force
she
said
with
her
nostril
dilating
i
shall
go
of
course
if
i
am
threatened
then
philip
must
not
go
do
you
know
what
has
happened
in
the
family
to
which
he
belongs
and
must
belong
whether
you
like
it
or
not
do
you
know
that
the
boy
may
be
lord
lomond
before
the
week
is
out
that
his
uncle
is
dying
and
that
your
husband
is
the
heir
she
turned
round
upon
him
slowly
fixing
her
eyes
upon
his
with
simple
astonishment
and
no
more
in
her
look
her
mind
so
absorbed
in
other
thoughts
hardly
took
in
what
he
could
mean
have
you
not
heard
this
elinor
but
there
is
hal
she
said
hal
the
other
brother
who
comes
first
hal
is
dead
and
the
one
in
india
is
dead
and
lord
serf
is
dying
the
boy
is
the
heir
you
must
not
you
can
not
take
him
away
it
is
impossible
elinor
it
is
against
all
nature
and
justice
you
have
had
him
for
all
these
years
his
father
has
a
right
to
his
heir
oh
john
she
cried
in
a
bitter
note
of
reproach
oh
john
john
well
he
cried
is
not
what
i
tell
you
the
truth
would
philip
give
it
up
if
it
were
offered
to
him
he
is
almost
a
man
let
him
judge
for
himself
oh
john
john
when
you
know
that
the
object
of
my
life
has
been
to
keep
him
from
knowing
to
shut
that
chapter
of
my
life
altogether
to
bring
him
up
apart
from
all
evil
influences
from
all
instructions
and
from
his
birthright
elinor
she
stopped
giving
him
another
sudden
look
the
natural
language
of
a
woman
brought
to
bay
she
drew
a
long
breath
in
impatience
and
desperation
not
knowing
what
to
reply
for
what
could
she
reply
his
birthright
to
be
lord
lomond
lord
serf
the
head
of
the
house
what
was
that
far
far
better
philip
dennistoun
of
lakeside
the
heir
of
his
mother
and
his
grandmother
two
stainless
women
with
enough
for
everything
that
was
honest
and
of
good
report
enough
to
permit
him
to
be
an
unworldly
scholar
a
lover
of
art
a
traveller
any
that
he
chose
if
he
did
not
incline
to
graver
work
ah
but
she
had
not
been
so
wise
as
that
she
had
not
brought
him
up
as
philip
dennistoun
he
was
philip
compton
she
had
not
been
bold
enough
to
change
his
name
she
stood
at
bay
surrounded
as
it
were
by
her
enemies
and
confronted
john
tatham
who
had
been
her
constant
companion
and
defender
as
if
all
that
was
hostile
to
her
all
that
was
against
her
peace
was
embodied
in
him
i
must
go
a
little
further
elinor
said
john
though
god
knows
that
to
add
to
your
pain
is
the
last
thing
in
the
world
i
wish
you
have
been
left
unmolested
for
a
very
long
time
and
we
have
all
thought
your
retreat
was
unknown
i
confess
it
has
surprised
me
for
my
experience
has
always
been
that
everything
is
known
but
you
have
been
subpoenaed
for
this
trial
therefore
my
dear
girl
we
must
give
up
that
idea
everybody
that
is
virtually
everybody
all
that
are
of
any
consequence
know
where
you
are
and
all
you
are
about
now
she
sank
into
a
chair
still
keeping
her
eyes
upon
him
as
if
it
were
possible
that
he
might
take
some
advantage
of
her
if
she
withdrew
them
then
still
not
knowing
what
to
reply
seized
at
the
last
words
because
they
were
the
last
and
had
little
to
do
with
the
main
issue
all
about
me
she
said
faintly
as
if
there
had
been
something
else
besides
the
place
of
her
refuge
to
conceal
you
know
what
i
mean
elinor
the
moment
that
your
home
is
known
all
is
known
that
philip
lives
and
is
well
a
promising
boy
that
you
have
brought
him
up
to
do
honour
to
any
title
or
any
position
he
could
not
help
saying
this
and
partly
in
the
testimony
to
her
partly
for
love
of
the
boy
john
tatham
voice
faltered
a
little
and
the
water
came
into
his
eyes
ah
john
you
say
that
she
cried
as
if
it
had
been
an
admission
forced
from
him
against
his
will
what
could
i
say
otherwise
elinor
because
i
do
approve
of
all
your
proceedings
because
i
do
think
you
have
been
wise
in
one
respect
is
that
to
say
that
i
do
not
understand
and
know
i
am
not
such
a
fool
or
a
formalist
as
you
give
me
credit
for
being
you
have
made
him
all
that
the
fondest
and
proudest
could
desire
you
have
done
far
better
for
him
i
do
not
doubt
for
a
moment
than
but
my
dear
cousin
my
dear
girl
my
poor
nellie
yes
john
he
paused
a
moment
and
then
he
said
right
is
right
and
justice
is
justice
at
the
end
of
all
chapter
xxxvii
when
elinor
received
the
official
document
which
had
so
extraordinary
an
effect
upon
her
life
and
overturned
in
a
moment
all
the
fabric
of
domestic
quiet
and
security
which
she
had
been
building
up
for
years
it
was
outside
the
tranquil
walls
of
the
house
at
lakeside
in
the
garden
which
lay
between
it
and
the
opening
upon
that
not
very
road
by
a
pair
of
somewhat
imposing
gates
which
gave
the
little
establishment
an
air
of
more
pretension
than
it
really
possessed
some
fine
trees
shrouded
the
little
avenue
and
elinor
was
standing
under
one
of
them
stooping
over
a
little
nest
of
primroses
at
its
roots
from
which
the
yellow
buds
were
peeping
forth
when
she
heard
behind
her
the
sound
of
a
vehicle
at
the
gates
and
the
quick
leap
to
the
ground
of
someone
who
opened
them
then
there
was
a
pause
the
carriage
whatever
it
was
did
not
come
farther
and
presently
she
herself
a
little
curious
turned
round
to
see
a
man
approaching
her
whom
she
did
not
know
a
driven
by
another
whose
face
she
recognized
waited
in
the
road
while
the
stranger
came
forward
you
are
compton
he
said
a
swift
thrill
of
alarm
she
could
scarcely
tell
why
ran
over
elinor
from
head
to
foot
she
had
been
settled
for
nearly
eighteen
years
at
lakeside
what
could
happen
to
frighten
her
now
but
it
tingled
to
her
very
fingers
ends
and
then
he
said
something
to
her
which
she
scarcely
understood
but
which
sent
that
tingle
to
her
very
heart
and
brain
and
gave
her
the
suspicious
looking
blue
paper
which
he
held
in
his
hand
it
all
passed
in
a
moment
of
time
to
her
dazed
yet
excited
consciousness
the
early
primrose
which
she
had
gathered
had
not
had
time
to
droop
in
her
grasp
though
she
crushed
the
stalk
unconsciously
in
her
fingers
before
the
gates
were
closed
again
the
sound
of
the
departing
wheels
growing
faint
on
the
road
and
she
herself
standing
like
one
paralyzed
with
that
thing
in
her
hand
a
subpoena
what
was
a
subpoena
she
knew
as
little
perhaps
less
than
the
children
in
the
parish
school
who
began
to
troop
along
the
road
in
their
resounding
clogs
at
their
dinner
hour
the
sound
of
this
awoke
her
a
little
to
a
frightened
sense
that
she
had
better
put
this
document
out
of
sight
at
least
until
she
could
manage
to
understand
it
and
then
she
sped
swiftly
away
past
the
pretty
white
house
lying
in
the
sunshine
with
all
its
doors
and
windows
open
to
the
little
wood
behind
where
it
would
be
possible
to
think
and
find
out
at
her
leisure
what
this
was
it
was
a
small
wood
and
a
public
path
ran
through
it
but
where
the
public
was
so
limited
as
at
lakeside
this
scarcely
impaired
the
privacy
of
the
inhabitants
at
least
in
the
morning
when
everybody
in
the
parish
was
at
work
elinor
hurried
past
the
house
that
her
mother
might
not
see
her
and
climbed
the
woody
hillock
to
a
spot
which
was
peculiarly
her
own
and
where
a
seat
had
been
placed
for
her
special
use
it
was
a
little
mount
of
vision
from
which
she
could
look
out
up
and
down
at
the
long
winding
line
of
the
lake
cleaving
the
green
slopes
and
away
to
the
rugged
and
solemn
peaks
among
which
lay
in
his
mountain
fastnesses
helvellyn
with
his
hoary
brethren
crowding
round
him
elinor
had
watched
the
changes
of
many
a
day
full
of
endless
vicissitudes
of
flying
clouds
and
gleams
of
sunshine
from
that
seat
and
had
hoped
and
tried
to
believe
that
nothing
save
these
vicissitudes
of
nature
would
ever
again
disturb
her
had
she
really
believed
that
her
heart
thumping
against
her
breast
and
the
pulses
of
her
brain
beating
loud
in
her
ears
answered
no
she
had
never
believed
it
she
had
known
notwithstanding
all
her
obstinacy
and
indignant
opposition
to
all
who
warned
her
that
some
day
or
other
her
home
must
be
broken
up
and
the
storm
burst
upon
her
but
even
such
a
conviction
desperately
fought
against
and
resisted
is
a
very
different
matter
from
the
awful
sense
of
certainty
that
it
has
come
the
trees
were
thick
enough
to
conceal
her
from
any
on
the
path
the
young
foliage
of
the
birches
fluttered
over
her
head
while
a
solid
fir
or
two
stood
grim
guardians
yet
catching
pathetic
airs
from
every
passing
wind
to
soothe
her
but
elinor
neither
heard
nor
saw
lake
mountain
nor
sunshine
nor
spring
breezes
but
only
the
bit
of
paper
in
her
hand
and
the
uncomprehended
words
she
had
heard
when
it
was
given
to
her
it
was
not
long
however
before
she
perceived
and
knew
exactly
what
it
meant
it
was
a
subpoena
in
the
case
of
the
queen
brown
to
attend
and
give
evidence
on
a
certain
day
in
may
in
london
it
was
for
a
few
minutes
a
mystery
to
her
as
great
as
it
was
alarming
notwithstanding
the
swift
and
certain
mental
conviction
she
had
that
it
concerned
infallibly
the
one
secret
and
mystery
of
her
life
but
as
she
sat
there
pondering
those
strange
strays
of
recollection
that
come
to
the
mind
of
things
unnoted
yet
unconsciously
stored
by
memory
drew
gradually
about
her
piecing
out
the
threads
of
conviction
she
remembered
to
have
heard
her
mother
read
among
the
many
scraps
which
dennistoun
loved
to
read
out
when
the
newspaper
arrived
something
about
a
man
who
had
absconded
whose
name
was
brown
who
had
brought
ruin
on
many
and
had
at
length
after
a
number
of
years
ventured
back
to
england
and
had
been
caught
it
was
one
of
the
weaknesses
of
dennistoun
advancing
years
to
like
these
bits
of
news
though
there
might
be
little
interest
in
them
to
so
quiet
a
household
and
her
daughter
was
wont
to
listen
with
a
very
vague
attention
noting
but
a
word
now
and
then
answering
vaguely
the
lively
remarks
her
mother
would
make
on
the
subjects
in
this
case
even
she
had
paid
no
attention
and
yet
the
moment
that
strong
keynote
had
been
struck
which
vibrated
through
her
whole
being
this
echo
suddenly
woke
up
and
resounded
as
if
it
had
been
thundered
in
her
ears
brown
she
began
to
remember
bit
by
bit
and
yet
what
had
she
to
do
with
brown
he
had
not
defrauded
her
she
had
never
seen
him
she
knew
nothing
about
his
delinquencies
then
there
came
another
note
faintly
out
of
the
distance
of
the
years
her
husband
image
i
need
not
say
had
come
suddenly
into
her
sight
with
the
first
burst
of
this
new
event
his
voice
seemed
to
be
in
the
air
saying
things
what
had
he
to
do
with
this
man
oh
she
knew
very
well
there
was
something
something
which
she
would
have
given
her
life
not
to
recollect
which
she
knew
in
another
moment
would
flash
completely
upon
her
as
she
tried
not
to
remember
it
and
then
suddenly
her
working
mind
caught
another
string
which
was
not
that
which
was
a
relief
to
that
for
the
moment
brown
who
was
it
that
had
talked
of
brown
and
the
books
that
were
destroyed
and
the
and
the
day
that
phil
compton
arrived
at
windyhill
elinor
rose
up
from
her
seat
with
a
gasp
she
put
her
arm
round
the
rough
stem
of
the
to
support
herself
but
it
shook
with
her
though
there
was
no
wind
only
the
softest
of
morning
airs
she
saw
before
her
a
scene
very
different
from
this
the
flowery
garden
at
the
cottage
with
the
copse
and
the
sandy
road
beyond
and
the
man
whom
phil
had
expected
whom
he
had
been
so
anxious
to
see
and
his
fingers
catching
hers
keeping
her
by
him
and
the
questions
to
which
she
had
replied
twenty
years
what
a
long
time
it
is
time
enough
for
a
boy
to
grow
into
almost
a
man
who
had
not
been
born
or
thought
of
and
yet
what
a
moment
what
a
nothing
her
mind
flashed
from
that
scene
in
the
garden
to
the
little
hall
in
the
cottage
the
maid
stooping
down
fastening
the
bolt
of
the
door
the
calendar
hanging
on
the
wall
with
the
big
showing
so
visible
so
obtrusive
forcing
itself
as
it
were
on
the
notice
of
all
only
ten
days
nell
and
the
maid
glance
upwards
of
shy
sympathy
and
the
blank
of
dennistoun
face
and
his
look
oh
that
look
of
his
which
was
true
and
yet
so
false
which
meant
so
much
besides
and
yet
surely
surely
meant
love
too
the
young
creaked
and
swayed
in
elinor
grip
she
unloosed
it
as
if
the
slim
thing
had
cried
under
the
pressure
and
sat
down
again
she
had
nothing
to
grasp
at
nothing
oh
her
life
had
not
been
without
support
her
mother
how
extraordinary
had
been
her
good
fortune
to
have
her
mother
to
fall
back
upon
when
she
was
shipwrecked
in
her
life
to
have
a
home
a
shelter
a
perpetual
protector
and
champion
who
whether
she
approved
or
disapproved
would
forsake
her
never
and
then
the
boy
god
bless
him
who
might
quiver
like
the
little
fir
if
she
flung
herself
upon
him
but
who
she
knew
would
stand
as
true
oh
god
forbid
god
forbid
that
he
should
ever
know
oh
god
help
her
god
help
her
how
was
she
to
keep
it
from
his
knowledge
elinor
flung
herself
down
upon
the
mossy
knoll
in
her
despair
as
this
came
pouring
into
her
mind
a
flood
of
horrible
light
of
unimaginable
bitterness
he
must
not
know
he
must
not
know
and
yet
how
was
it
to
be
kept
from
his
knowledge
it
was
a
public
thing
it
could
not
be
hid
it
would
be
in
all
the
papers
his
father
name
and
the
boy
did
not
know
he
had
a
father
living
and
his
mother
evidence
on
behalf
of
her
husband
and
the
boy
thought
she
had
no
husband
this
was
what
had
been
said
to
her
again
and
again
and
again
sometime
the
boy
must
know
and
she
had
pushed
it
from
her
angrily
indignantly
asking
why
should
he
know
though
in
the
bottom
of
her
own
heart
she
too
was
aware
that
it
was
the
delusion
of
a
fool
and
that
the
time
must
come
but
how
could
she
ever
have
thought
that
it
would
come
like
this
that
the
boy
would
discover
his
father
through
the
summons
of
his
mother
to
a
public
court
to
defend
her
husband
from
a
criminal
accusation
oh
life
that
pardons
nothing
oh
severe
unchanging
heaven
that
this
should
be
the
way
and
then
there
came
into
elinor
mind
wild
thoughts
of
flight
she
was
not
a
woman
whose
nature
it
was
to
endure
when
things
became
intolerable
to
her
she
fled
from
them
as
the
reader
knows
escaped
shutting
her
ears
to
all
advice
and
her
heart
to
all
thoughts
except
that
life
had
become
intolerable
and
that
she
could
bear
it
no
longer
it
is
not
easy
to
hold
the
balance
even
in
such
matters
had
elinor
fulfilled
what
would
appear
to
many
her
first
duty
and
stood
by
phil
through
neglect
and
misery
as
she
had
vowed
for
better
for
worse
she
would
by
this
time
have
been
not
only
a
wretched
but
a
deteriorated
woman
and
her
son
most
probably
would
have
been
injured
both
in
his
moral
and
intellectual
being
what
she
had
done
was
not
the
abstract
duty
of
her
marriage
vow
but
it
had
been
better
had
it
not
been
better
for
them
both
in
such
a
question
who
is
to
be
the
judge
and
now
again
there
came
surging
up
into
elinor
veins
the
impulse
of
flight
to
take
the
boy
and
fly
she
could
take
him
where
he
wished
most
to
go
to
the
scenes
of
that
literature
and
history
of
which
his
schoolboy
head
was
full
to
the
happiest
ideal
wandering
his
mother
and
he
two
companions
almost
better
than
lovers
how
his
eyes
would
brighten
at
the
thought
among
the
summer
seas
the
golden
islands
the
ideal
countries
away
from
all
the
trouble
and
cares
all
the
burdens
of
the
past
all
the
fears
of
the
future
why
should
she
be
held
by
that
villainous
paper
and
obey
that
dreadful
summons
why
allow
all
her
precautions
all
the
fabric
of
her
life
to
fall
in
a
moment
why
pour
upon
the
boy
the
horror
of
that
revelation
when
everything
she
had
done
and
planned
all
his
life
had
been
to
keep
it
from
him
in
the
sudden
energy
of
that
new
possibility
of
escape
elinor
rose
up
again
from
the
prostration
of
despair
she
saw
once
more
the
line
of
shining
water
at
her
feet
full
of
heavenly
splendour
the
mountain
tops
sunning
themselves
in
the
morning
light
the
peace
and
the
beauty
that
was
over
all
and
there
was
nothing
needed
but
a
long
journey
which
would
be
delightful
full
of
pleasure
and
refreshment
to
secure
her
peace
to
her
and
to
save
her
boy
when
she
had
calmed
herself
with
this
new
project
which
the
moment
it
took
form
in
her
mind
seemed
of
itself
without
reference
to
the
cause
the
most
delightful
project
in
the
world
and
full
of
pleasure
elinor
smoothed
back
her
hair
put
her
garden
hat
which
had
got
a
little
out
of
order
straight
and
took
her
way
again
towards
the
house
her
heart
had
already
escaped
from
the
shock
and
horror
and
was
beating
softly
exhausted
yet
refreshed
in
her
bosom
she
felt
almost
like
a
child
who
had
sobbed
all
its
troubles
out
or
like
a
convalescent
recovering
from
a
brief
but
violent
illness
and
pathetically
happy
in
the
cessation
of
pain
she
went
along
quietly
slowly
by
the
woodland
path
among
the
trees
full
of
the
sweetness
of
the
morning
which
seemed
to
have
come
back
to
her
should
she
say
anything
about
it
to
her
mother
or
only
by
degrees
announce
to
her
the
plan
she
had
begun
to
form
for
pleasure
the
long
delightful
ramble
which
would
come
between
his
and
the
university
she
had
almost
decided
that
she
would
do
this
when
she
went
into
the
house
but
she
had
not
been
half
an
hour
with
her
mother
when
her
intention
became
untenable
for
the
good
reason
that
she
had
already
told
dennistoun
of
the
new
incident
they
were
not
in
the
habit
of
keeping
secrets
from
each
other
and
in
that
case
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
so
difficult
it
requires
training
to
keep
one
affairs
to
one
self
in
the
constant
presence
of
those
who
are
our
nearest
and
dearest
some
people
may
be
capable
of
this
effort
of
but
elinor
was
not
she
had
showed
that
alarming
paper
to
her
mother
with
a
partial
return
of
her
own
terror
at
the
sight
of
it
before
she
knew
and
i
need
not
say
that
for
a
short
time
dennistoun
was
overwhelmed
by
that
natural
horror
too
but
she
said
what
do
you
know
what
can
you
tell
about
this
brown
elinor
you
never
saw
him
in
your
life
i
think
i
know
what
it
means
said
elinor
with
a
sudden
dark
glow
of
colour
which
faded
instantly
leaving
her
quite
pale
she
added
hurriedly
there
were
some
books
destroyed
i
can
not
tell
you
the
rights
of
the
story
it
is
too
dreadful
altogether
but
another
was
exculpated
by
the
date
of
the
day
he
arrived
at
windyhill
this
must
be
the
reason
i
am
called
the
date
he
arrived
before
your
marriage
elinor
but
then
they
might
call
me
and
you
need
not
appear
not
for
the
world
mother
cried
elinor
the
colour
rose
again
and
faded
besides
you
do
not
remember
oh
i
could
make
it
out
said
dennistoun
it
was
when
he
came
from
scotland
and
went
off
in
the
evening
next
day
i
do
at
this
moment
remember
what
the
day
was
but
i
could
make
it
out
it
was
about
a
fortnight
before
it
was
do
you
remember
mother
the
little
calendar
in
the
hall
and
what
it
marked
and
what
he
said
i
remember
of
course
perfectly
well
the
little
calendar
in
the
hall
you
gave
it
me
at
christmas
and
it
was
always
out
of
order
and
never
kept
right
but
i
could
make
it
out
without
that
you
must
not
think
of
it
for
a
moment
cried
elinor
with
a
shudder
there
had
been
so
many
things
to
think
of
that
it
had
scarcely
occurred
to
her
what
it
was
to
which
she
had
to
bear
witness
she
told
her
mother
hurriedly
the
story
of
that
incident
and
then
she
added
without
stopping
to
take
breath
but
i
will
not
appear
i
can
not
appear
we
must
keep
it
out
of
the
papers
at
every
cost
mother
do
not
think
it
dreadful
of
me
i
will
run
away
with
pippo
far
away
if
you
will
not
be
anxious
this
is
just
his
chance
between
school
and
college
i
will
take
him
to
greece
to
greece
elinor
dennistoun
cried
with
almost
a
shriek
mother
dear
it
is
not
so
very
far
away
i
am
not
thinking
how
far
away
it
is
elinor
and
leave
his
reputation
to
suffer
leave
him
perhaps
to
be
ruined
by
a
false
charge
oh
mother
cried
elinor
starting
to
her
feet
she
was
quite
unprepared
for
such
remonstrance
my
dear
i
have
not
opposed
you
though
there
have
been
many
things
i
have
scarcely
approved
of
but
elinor
this
must
not
be
run
away
from
the
law
allow
another
to
suffer
when
you
can
clear
him
elinor
elinor
this
must
not
be
unless
i
can
go
and
be
his
witness
in
your
place
i
might
do
that
said
dennistoun
seriously
she
paused
a
moment
and
then
she
said
but
i
think
you
are
wrong
about
the
sixth
he
stayed
only
one
night
and
the
night
he
went
away
was
the
night
that
alick
hudson
who
was
going
up
for
his
examination
i
can
make
it
out
exactly
if
you
will
give
me
a
little
time
to
think
it
over
my
poor
child
that
you
should
have
this
to
disturb
your
peace
but
i
will
go
elinor
i
can
clear
him
as
well
as
you
elinor
stood
up
before
her
pallid
as
a
ghost
for
god
sake
mother
not
another
word
she
said
with
a
dreadful
solemnity
the
burden
is
mine
and
i
must
bear
it
let
us
not
say
a
word
more
chapter
xxxviii
i
will
not
confuse
the
reader
with
a
description
of
all
thoughts
during
the
slow
progress
of
that
afternoon
and
evening
which
were
as
the
slow
passing
of
a
year
to
her
impatient
spirit
she
took
the
usual
afternoon
walk
with
her
mother
soberly
as
became
dennistoun
increasing
years
and
then
she
made
a
pretext
of
some
errands
in
the
village
to
occupy
her
until
dark
or
rather
to
leave
her
free
to
twist
the
thread
of
her
own
thoughts
as
she
went
along
the
silent
country
road
her
thoughts
varied
in
the
afternoon
from
those
which
had
seized
upon
her
with
such
vulture
claws
in
the
morning
but
they
were
not
less
overwhelming
in
that
respect
her
mother
suggestion
that
and
not
elinor
should
be
the
witness
of
that
date
and
then
her
ponderings
as
to
that
date
her
slow
certainty
that
she
could
make
it
out
or
puzzle
it
out
as
elinor
in
her
impatience
said
which
was
the
last
of
all
things
to
be
desired
had
stung
the
daughter
into
a
new
and
miserable
realization
of
what
it
was
that
was
demanded
of
her
which
nobody
could
do
but
she
what
was
it
that
would
be
demanded
of
her
to
stand
up
in
the
face
of
god
and
man
and
swear
to
tell
the
truth
and
tell
a
lie
or
else
let
the
man
who
had
been
her
husband
the
love
of
her
youth
the
father
of
her
boy
sink
into
an
abyss
of
shame
she
thought
rapidly
knowing
nothing
that
surely
there
could
be
no
punishment
for
him
even
if
it
were
proved
at
the
long
interval
of
twenty
years
but
shame
there
would
be
shame
nothing
could
save
him
from
that
shame
which
would
descend
more
or
less
to
his
son
and
then
elinor
reflected
with
hot
moisture
coming
out
upon
her
forehead
against
the
cold
breeze
of
the
spring
night
on
what
would
be
asked
of
her
oh
no
doubt
it
would
be
cleverly
done
she
would
be
asked
if
she
remembered
his
visit
and
why
she
remembered
it
she
would
be
led
on
carefully
to
tell
the
story
of
the
calendar
in
the
hall
and
of
how
it
was
but
ten
days
before
her
marriage
the
last
hurried
unexpected
visit
of
the
lover
before
he
came
as
a
bridegroom
to
take
her
away
it
would
be
all
true
every
word
and
yet
it
would
be
a
lie
and
standing
up
there
in
that
public
place
she
would
be
made
to
repeat
it
as
she
had
done
in
the
flowery
garden
in
the
sunshine
twenty
years
ago
then
dazed
and
bewildered
not
knowing
what
she
did
and
with
something
of
the
blind
confidence
of
youth
and
love
in
saying
what
she
was
told
to
say
but
now
with
clearer
insight
with
a
horrible
certainty
of
the
falsehood
of
that
true
story
and
the
object
with
which
it
was
required
of
her
happily
for
herself
elinor
did
not
think
of
the
ordeal
of
through
which
witnesses
have
to
pass
she
would
not
i
think
have
feared
that
if
the
instinct
of
combativeness
had
been
roused
in
her
her
quick
wit
and
ready
spirit
would
not
have
failed
in
defending
herself
and
in
maintaining
the
accuracy
of
the
fact
to
which
she
had
to
bear
witness
it
was
herself
and
not
an
opposing
counsel
that
was
alarming
to
elinor
but
i
have
promised
that
the
reader
should
not
be
compelled
to
go
through
all
the
trouble
and
torment
of
her
thoughts
dinner
with
the
respect
which
is
necessary
for
the
servant
who
waits
whether
that
may
be
a
solemn
butler
with
his
myrmidons
or
a
little
maid
always
makes
a
pause
in
household
communications
but
when
the
ladies
were
established
afterwards
by
the
pleasant
fireside
which
had
been
their
centre
of
life
for
so
many
years
and
with
the
cheerful
lamp
on
the
table
between
them
which
had
lighted
so
many
cheerful
talks
readings
discussions
and
consultations
the
new
subject
of
anxiety
and
interest
immediately
came
forth
again
it
was
dennistoun
who
spoke
first
she
had
grown
older
as
we
all
do
she
wore
spectacles
as
she
worked
and
often
a
white
shawl
on
her
shoulders
and
was
as
sometimes
her
daughter
felt
with
shame
of
herself
to
remark
it
a
little
slower
in
speech
a
little
more
pertinacious
and
insistent
not
perhaps
perceiving
with
such
quick
sympathy
the
changes
and
fluctuations
of
other
minds
and
whether
it
was
advisable
or
not
to
follow
a
subject
to
the
bitter
end
she
said
looking
up
from
her
knitting
with
a
little
rhetorical
movement
of
her
hand
which
elinor
feared
and
which
showed
that
she
felt
herself
on
assured
and
certain
ground
my
dear
i
have
been
thinking
i
have
made
it
out
day
by
day
god
knows
there
were
plenty
of
landmarks
in
it
to
keep
any
one
from
forgetting
i
can
now
make
out
certainly
the
day
of
which
we
were
speaking
and
if
you
will
give
me
your
attention
for
a
minute
or
two
elinor
you
will
see
that
whatever
the
calendar
said
which
i
never
noticed
for
it
was
as
often
wrong
as
right
you
are
making
a
mis
oh
for
heaven
sake
mother
cried
elinor
do
let
us
talk
of
that
any
more
i
have
no
desire
to
talk
of
it
my
dear
child
but
for
what
you
said
i
should
never
but
of
course
we
must
take
some
action
about
this
thing
this
paper
you
have
got
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
best
thing
would
be
to
write
to
john
and
see
whether
he
could
not
manage
to
get
it
transferred
from
you
to
me
i
ca
see
what
difficulty
there
could
be
about
that
i
would
not
have
it
for
the
world
mother
and
what
good
would
it
do
the
great
thing
in
it
the
dreadful
thing
would
be
unchanged
whether
you
appear
or
me
pippo
would
be
made
to
know
all
the
same
what
it
has
been
our
joint
object
to
conceal
from
him
all
his
life
dennistoun
did
not
say
anything
but
she
would
not
have
been
mortal
if
she
had
not
very
slightly
but
yet
very
visibly
to
keen
eyes
shaken
her
head
i
know
what
you
mean
said
elinor
vehemently
that
it
has
been
i
and
not
we
whose
object
has
been
to
conceal
it
from
him
oh
yes
i
know
you
are
right
but
at
least
you
consented
to
it
you
have
helped
in
it
it
is
your
doing
as
well
as
mine
elinor
elinor
cried
her
mother
who
having
always
protested
was
not
prepared
for
this
accusation
is
there
any
advantage
to
be
got
said
elinor
like
an
injured
and
indignant
champion
of
the
right
in
opening
up
the
whole
question
over
again
now
what
could
poor
dennistoun
do
she
was
confounded
as
she
often
had
been
before
by
those
swift
and
sudden
tactics
she
gave
a
glance
up
at
her
daughter
over
her
spectacles
but
she
said
nothing
argument
she
knew
by
long
experience
was
difficult
to
keep
up
with
such
an
opponent
but
john
is
an
idea
said
elinor
i
do
know
why
i
should
not
have
thought
of
him
he
may
suggest
something
that
could
be
done
i
thought
of
him
of
course
at
once
said
dennistoun
not
able
to
refrain
from
that
small
piece
of
it
is
not
a
time
that
it
would
be
easy
for
him
to
leave
town
but
at
least
you
could
write
and
lay
your
difficulties
before
him
and
suggest
oh
you
may
be
sure
mother
cried
elinor
i
know
what
i
have
to
say
i
never
doubted
it
my
dear
said
dennistoun
gently
and
then
there
was
a
little
pause
they
sat
and
worked
the
elder
lady
stumbling
a
little
over
her
knitting
her
thoughts
being
so
much
engaged
the
younger
one
plying
a
flying
needle
the
passion
and
impetus
of
her
thoughts
lending
only
additional
swiftness
and
vigour
to
everything
she
did
and
for
ten
minutes
or
more
there
was
nothing
to
be
heard
in
the
room
but
the
little
drop
of
ashes
from
the
fire
the
sudden
burst
of
a
little
from
the
coals
the
rustle
of
elinor
arm
as
it
moved
the
cat
sat
with
her
tail
curled
round
her
before
the
fire
the
image
of
dignified
repose
winking
at
the
flames
the
two
human
inhabitants
save
for
the
movements
of
their
hands
might
have
been
in
wax
they
were
so
still
suddenly
however
the
quietness
was
broken
by
an
energetic
movement
elinor
threw
her
work
down
on
the
table
and
rose
from
her
chair
she
went
to
the
window
and
drew
the
curtain
aside
and
looked
out
upon
the
night
she
shut
it
carefully
again
and
going
to
the
struck
a
match
and
lighted
the
candles
there
and
sat
down
and
began
or
appeared
to
begin
to
write
then
she
rose
quickly
again
and
returned
to
the
table
at
which
dennistoun
was
still
seated
knitting
on
but
watching
every
movement
of
her
restless
companion
mother
she
said
i
ca
write
i
have
far
too
much
to
say
i
will
run
up
to
town
myself
and
see
john
to
town
elinor
by
yourself
my
dear
you
forget
it
is
not
an
journey
as
it
was
to
windyhill
i
know
that
very
well
mother
but
even
the
journey
will
be
an
advantage
the
movement
will
do
me
good
and
i
can
tell
john
much
better
than
i
could
write
who
could
write
about
a
complicated
business
like
this
he
will
understand
me
when
he
sees
me
at
half
a
word
whereas
in
writing
one
can
never
explain
do
oppose
me
please
mother
i
feel
that
to
do
something
to
get
myself
in
motion
is
the
only
thing
for
me
now
i
will
not
oppose
you
elinor
i
have
done
so
perhaps
too
little
my
dear
but
we
will
not
speak
of
that
no
doubt
as
you
say
you
will
understand
each
other
better
if
you
tell
him
the
circumstances
face
to
face
but
oh
my
dear
child
do
nothing
rash
be
guided
by
john
he
is
a
prudent
adviser
the
only
thing
is
that
he
no
more
than
i
has
ever
been
able
to
resist
you
elinor
if
you
had
set
your
heart
upon
any
course
oh
my
dear
do
go
to
john
with
a
foregone
conclusion
hear
first
what
he
has
to
say
elinor
came
behind
her
mother
with
one
of
those
quick
returns
of
affectionate
impulse
which
were
natural
to
her
and
put
her
arms
suddenly
round
dennistoun
you
have
always
been
far
too
good
to
me
mamma
she
said
kissing
her
tenderly
both
john
and
you
and
next
morning
she
carried
out
her
swiftly
conceived
intention
and
went
to
town
as
the
reader
is
aware
a
long
railway
journey
is
sometimes
soothing
to
one
distracted
with
agitation
and
trouble
the
quiet
and
the
noise
which
serves
as
a
kind
of
accompaniment
half
silencing
half
promoting
too
active
thought
the
forced
abstraction
and
silence
and
of
mind
and
body
which
are
equally
restless
but
which
in
that
enclosure
are
bound
to
exercise
in
spite
of
all
struggles
of
the
subject
a
subduing
effect
and
it
was
a
strange
thing
that
in
the
seclusion
of
the
railway
compartment
in
which
she
travelled
alone
there
came
for
the
first
time
to
elinor
a
softening
thought
the
sudden
sensation
of
a
feeling
of
which
she
had
not
been
sensible
for
years
towards
the
man
whose
name
she
bore
it
occurred
to
her
quite
suddenly
she
could
not
tell
how
as
if
some
one
invisible
had
thrown
that
reflection
into
her
mind
and
i
confess
that
i
am
of
opinion
they
do
those
who
are
around
us
who
are
unseen
darting
into
our
souls
thoughts
which
do
not
originate
with
us
thoughts
not
always
of
good
blasphemies
as
well
as
blessings
it
occurred
to
her
i
say
coming
into
her
mind
like
an
arrow
that
after
all
she
had
not
been
so
well
hidden
as
she
thought
all
these
years
seeing
that
she
had
been
found
at
once
without
difficulty
it
appeared
when
she
was
wanted
did
this
mean
that
he
had
known
where
she
was
all
the
time
known
but
never
made
any
attempt
to
disturb
her
quiet
the
thought
startled
her
very
much
revealing
to
her
a
momentary
glimpse
of
something
that
looked
like
magnanimity
like
consideration
and
generous
could
these
things
be
he
could
have
hurt
her
very
much
had
he
pleased
even
during
the
time
she
had
remained
at
windyhill
when
certainly
he
knew
where
she
was
and
he
had
not
done
so
he
might
have
taken
her
child
from
her
at
least
he
might
have
made
her
life
miserable
with
fears
of
losing
her
child
and
he
had
not
done
so
if
indeed
it
was
true
that
he
had
known
where
she
was
all
the
time
and
had
never
done
anything
to
disturb
her
what
did
that
mean
this
thought
gave
elinor
perhaps
the
first
sense
of
and
guilt
that
she
had
ever
known
towards
this
man
who
was
her
husband
yet
whom
she
had
not
seen
for
more
than
eighteen
years
and
then
there
was
another
thing
after
that
interval
he
was
not
afraid
to
put
himself
into
her
hands
to
trust
to
her
loyalty
for
his
salvation
he
knew
that
she
could
betray
him
and
he
knew
equally
well
that
she
would
not
do
so
notwithstanding
the
eighteen
years
of
estrangement
and
mutual
wrong
that
lay
between
it
did
not
matter
that
the
loyalty
he
felt
sure
of
would
be
a
false
loyalty
an
upholding
of
what
was
not
true
he
would
think
little
of
that
as
likely
as
not
he
had
forgotten
all
about
that
he
would
know
that
her
testimony
would
clear
him
and
he
would
not
think
of
anything
else
and
even
did
he
think
of
it
the
fact
of
a
woman
making
a
little
like
that
would
never
have
affected
philip
but
the
strange
thing
was
that
he
had
no
fear
she
would
revenge
herself
by
standing
up
against
him
no
doubt
of
her
response
to
his
appeal
he
was
as
ready
to
put
his
fate
in
her
hands
as
if
she
had
been
the
most
devoted
of
wives
his
constant
companion
and
champion
this
had
the
most
curious
effect
upon
her
mind
almost
greater
than
the
other
she
had
shown
no
faith
in
him
but
he
had
faith
in
her
reckless
and
guilty
as
he
was
he
had
not
doubted
her
he
had
put
it
in
her
power
to
convict
him
not
only
of
the
worst
accusation
that
was
brought
against
him
but
of
a
monstrous
trick
to
prove
his
and
a
cruel
wrong
to
her
compelling
her
to
uphold
that
as
true
she
was
able
to
expose
him
if
she
chose
as
no
one
else
could
do
but
he
had
not
been
afraid
of
that
this
second
thought
which
burst
upon
elinor
without
any
volition
of
her
own
had
the
most
curious
effect
upon
her
she
abstained
carefully
anxiously
from
allowing
herself
to
be
drawn
into
making
any
conclusion
from
these
darts
of
unintended
thoughts
but
they
moved
her
in
spite
of
herself
they
made
her
think
of
him
which
she
had
for
a
long
time
abstained
from
doing
she
had
shut
her
heart
for
years
from
any
recollection
of
her
husband
trying
to
ignore
his
existence
in
thought
as
well
as
in
fact
and
she
had
succeeded
for
a
long
time
in
doing
this
but
now
in
a
moment
all
her
precautions
were
thrown
to
the
winds
he
came
into
her
memory
with
a
sudden
rush
for
which
she
was
no
way
responsible
breaking
all
the
barriers
she
had
put
up
against
him
that
he
should
have
known
where
she
was
all
this
time
and
never
disturbed
her
respected
her
solitude
all
these
years
that
when
the
moment
of
need
came
he
should
without
a
word
to
conciliate
her
without
an
explanation
or
an
apology
have
put
his
fate
into
her
hands
to
the
reader
who
understands
i
need
not
say
more
of
the
effect
upon
the
mind
of
elinor
hasty
generous
impatient
as
she
was
of
these
two
strange
facts
there
are
many
in
the
world
who
would
have
given
quite
a
different
explanation
who
would
have
made
out
of
the
fact
that
he
had
not
disturbed
her
only
the
explanation
that
phil
compton
was
tired
of
his
wife
and
glad
to
get
rid
of
her
at
any
price
and
who
would
have
seen
in
his
appeal
to
her
now
only
audacity
combined
with
the
conviction
that
she
would
not
compromise
herself
by
saying
anything
more
than
she
could
help
about
him
i
need
not
say
which
of
these
interpretations
would
have
been
the
true
one
but
the
first
will
understand
and
not
the
other
what
it
was
that
for
the
first
time
for
eighteen
years
awakened
a
struggle
and
controversy
which
she
could
not
ignore
and
vainly
endeavoured
to
overcome
in
elinor
heart
chapter
xxxix
elinor
had
not
been
three
days
gone
indeed
her
mother
had
but
just
received
a
hurried
note
announcing
her
arrival
in
london
when
as
she
sat
alone
in
the
house
which
had
become
so
silent
dennistoun
suddenly
became
aware
of
a
rising
of
sound
of
the
most
jubilant
almost
riotous
description
it
began
by
the
barking
of
yarrow
the
old
colley
who
was
fond
of
lying
at
the
gate
watching
in
a
philosophic
way
of
his
own
the
mild
traffic
of
the
country
road
the
children
trooping
by
to
school
who
hung
about
him
in
clusters
with
lavish
offerings
of
crust
and
scraps
of
biscuit
and
all
the
leisurely
country
whom
the
good
dog
despised
not
thinking
that
he
himself
did
nothing
but
at
his
own
door
in
the
sun
a
bark
from
yarrow
was
no
small
thing
in
the
stillness
of
the
spring
afternoon
and
little
urisk
the
terrier
who
lay
wrapt
in
dreams
at
dennistoun
feet
heard
where
he
lay
entranced
in
the
folds
of
sleep
and
cocked
up
an
eager
ear
and
uttered
a
subdued
interrogation
under
his
breath
the
next
thing
was
no
bark
but
a
shriek
of
joy
from
yarrow
such
as
could
mean
nothing
in
the
world
but
philip
or
pippo
which
was
what
no
doubt
the
dogs
called
him
between
following
their
mistress
urisk
heard
and
understood
he
made
but
one
spring
from
the
footstool
on
which
he
lay
and
flung
himself
against
the
door
dennistoun
sat
for
a
moment
and
listened
much
disturbed
when
some
troublous
incident
occurs
in
the
deep
quiet
of
domestic
life
how
often
is
it
followed
by
another
and
her
heart
turned
a
little
sick
she
was
not
comforted
even
by
the
fact
that
urisk
was
waggling
not
his
tail
only
but
his
whole
little
form
in
convulsions
of
joy
barking
crying
aloud
for
the
door
to
open
to
let
him
forth
by
this
time
all
the
friendly
dogs
about
had
taken
up
the
sound
out
of
sympathy
with
yarrow
yells
of
delight
and
into
this
came
the
clang
of
the
gate
the
sound
of
wheels
an
outcry
in
a
human
voice
that
of
barbara
the
maid
and
then
a
young
shout
that
rang
through
the
air
where
my
mother
barbara
where
granny
philip
it
may
be
imagined
did
not
wait
for
any
answer
but
came
in
headlong
yarrow
leaping
after
him
urisk
springing
into
the
air
to
meet
him
himself
in
too
great
a
hurry
to
heed
either
flinging
himself
upon
the
astonished
lady
who
rose
to
meet
him
with
a
sudden
kiss
and
a
where
my
mother
granny
of
eager
greeting
pippo
good
gracious
boy
what
brought
you
home
now
nothing
but
good
news
he
said
so
good
i
thought
i
must
come
got
it
granny
where
my
mother
you
got
it
she
said
so
full
of
other
thoughts
that
she
could
not
recollect
what
it
was
he
meant
pippo
thought
as
elinor
sometimes
thought
that
his
granny
was
getting
slow
of
understanding
not
so
bright
as
she
used
to
be
in
her
mind
oh
granny
you
been
dozing
the
scholarship
i
got
it
i
thought
you
would
know
the
moment
you
heard
me
at
the
door
my
dear
boy
she
said
putting
her
arms
about
him
while
the
tall
boy
stood
for
the
homage
done
to
him
the
kiss
of
congratulation
you
have
got
the
scholarship
notwithstanding
howard
and
musgrave
and
the
hard
fight
there
was
to
be
pippo
nodded
with
a
bright
face
of
pleasure
but
he
said
i
say
i
sorry
i
got
it
granny
but
i
wish
there
had
been
another
for
musgrave
for
he
worked
harder
than
i
did
and
he
wanted
so
to
win
but
so
did
i
for
that
matter
and
where
is
my
mother
all
this
time
how
delighted
she
will
be
and
what
a
comfort
to
her
just
now
when
she
is
upset
and
troubled
my
dear
it
be
a
dreadful
disappointment
to
you
your
mother
is
in
london
she
had
to
hurry
off
the
day
before
yesterday
on
business
in
london
cried
pippo
his
countenance
fell
he
was
so
much
disappointed
that
for
a
moment
big
boy
as
he
was
he
looked
ready
to
cry
he
had
come
in
bursting
with
his
news
expecting
a
reception
almost
as
tumultuous
as
that
given
him
by
the
dogs
outside
and
he
found
only
his
grandmother
who
forgot
what
it
was
he
was
in
for
and
no
mother
at
all
it
is
a
disappointment
pippo
and
it
will
be
such
a
disappointment
to
her
not
to
hear
it
from
your
own
lips
but
you
must
telegraph
at
once
and
that
will
be
next
best
she
has
some
worrying
business
things
that
she
hates
to
look
after
and
this
will
give
her
a
little
heart
what
a
bore
said
pippo
with
his
crest
down
and
the
light
gone
out
of
him
he
gave
himself
up
to
the
dogs
who
had
been
jumping
about
him
biding
their
time
yarrow
knew
he
said
laughing
to
get
the
water
out
of
his
eyes
he
gave
me
a
cheer
whenever
he
saw
me
dear
old
fellow
and
little
risky
too
and
only
granny
forgot
said
dennistoun
that
was
very
hard
upon
you
pippo
my
thoughts
were
all
with
your
mother
and
i
could
think
how
you
could
get
back
at
this
time
well
said
the
boy
my
work
over
you
know
there
nothing
for
a
fellow
to
do
after
he
got
the
scholarship
i
need
go
back
at
all
unless
you
and
my
mother
wish
it
i
in
a
sort
of
a
way
done
everything
that
i
can
do
do
laugh
at
me
granny
laugh
at
you
my
boy
it
is
likely
i
should
laugh
at
you
do
you
know
i
am
as
proud
of
you
as
your
mother
herself
can
be
i
am
glad
and
proud
said
dennistoun
for
i
am
glad
for
her
as
well
as
for
you
now
pippo
you
want
something
to
eat
the
boy
looked
up
with
a
laugh
yes
granny
he
said
you
always
divine
that
sort
of
thing
i
do
dennistoun
did
not
occupy
her
mind
with
any
thought
of
that
little
unintentional
and
grateful
jibe
that
she
always
divined
that
sort
of
thing
among
the
other
great
patiences
of
her
life
she
had
learnt
to
know
that
the
mother
and
son
loving
and
tender
as
they
were
had
put
her
back
unconsciously
into
the
proper
place
of
the
old
woman
always
consulted
always
thought
of
never
left
out
but
divining
chiefly
sort
of
the
actual
needs
the
more
apparent
thoughts
of
those
about
her
she
knew
it
but
she
did
not
dwell
upon
it
sometimes
it
made
her
smile
but
it
scarcely
hurt
her
and
never
made
her
bitter
she
comprehended
it
all
so
well
meanwhile
pippo
left
alone
devoted
himself
to
the
dogs
for
a
minute
or
two
making
them
almost
too
happy
then
at
the
very
climax
of
riotous
enjoyment
cast
them
off
with
a
sudden
down
yarrow
which
took
all
the
curl
in
a
moment
out
of
the
noble
tail
with
which
yarrow
was
sweeping
all
the
unconsidered
trifles
off
dennistoun
the
young
autocrat
walked
to
the
window
as
he
shook
off
his
adoring
vassal
and
stared
out
for
a
little
with
his
hands
deeply
dug
into
his
pockets
and
then
a
new
idea
came
into
pippo
head
the
most
brilliant
new
idea
which
restored
at
once
the
light
to
his
eyes
and
elevation
to
his
crest
he
said
nothing
of
this
however
till
he
had
done
justice
to
the
excellent
luncheon
while
his
grandmother
seated
beside
him
in
the
with
her
knitting
looked
on
with
pride
and
pleasure
and
saw
him
eat
this
was
a
thing
they
were
all
of
accord
which
she
always
thoroughly
understood
you
will
run
out
now
and
telegraph
to
your
mother
she
is
in
the
old
rooms
in
ebury
street
pippo
yes
granny
do
you
think
now
a
fellow
of
my
age
having
done
pretty
well
and
all
that
might
be
trusted
to
make
a
little
expedition
out
of
his
own
head
my
dear
you
have
always
been
trusted
pippo
you
know
i
remember
when
your
mother
or
i
either
have
shown
any
want
of
trust
oh
it
not
that
said
pippo
confused
i
know
i
had
lots
lots
far
more
than
most
fellows
of
my
own
way
it
was
not
that
exactly
i
meant
without
consulting
any
one
just
to
do
a
thing
out
of
my
own
head
i
have
no
doubt
it
will
be
quite
a
right
thing
pippo
but
i
should
know
better
if
you
were
to
tell
me
that
would
scarcely
be
doing
it
out
of
my
own
head
would
it
granny
but
i
ca
keep
a
thing
to
myself
now
musgrave
can
you
know
the
great
difference
i
suppose
it
is
having
nobody
but
my
mother
and
you
who
always
spoil
me
that
has
made
me
that
i
ca
keep
a
secret
it
is
something
about
making
it
up
to
musgrave
for
not
winning
the
scholarship
philip
grew
red
all
over
with
a
burning
blush
of
shame
what
a
beast
i
am
he
said
you
will
scarcely
believe
me
but
i
had
forgotten
that
though
i
do
wish
i
could
i
do
wish
there
was
any
way
no
granny
it
was
all
about
myself
well
my
dear
she
said
in
her
benignant
voice
it
is
no
use
going
beating
about
the
bush
he
said
granny
i
not
going
to
telegraph
to
mamma
i
run
up
to
london
by
the
night
mail
pippo
well
it
is
so
extraordinary
naturally
i
should
like
to
tell
her
better
than
to
write
it
did
quite
come
off
my
telling
it
to
you
did
it
but
my
mother
will
be
excited
about
it
and
then
it
will
be
a
surprise
seeing
me
at
all
and
then
if
she
is
worried
by
business
it
will
be
a
good
thing
to
have
me
to
stand
by
her
and
why
there
are
a
hundred
reasons
granny
as
you
must
see
and
then
i
should
like
it
above
all
my
dear
said
dennistoun
trembling
a
little
she
had
time
during
this
long
speech
to
collect
herself
to
get
over
the
first
shock
but
her
nerves
still
vibrated
in
ordinary
circumstances
i
should
think
it
an
excellent
plan
and
you
have
worked
well
for
it
and
won
your
holiday
and
your
mother
always
enjoys
wandering
about
town
with
you
still
pippo
now
what
can
there
be
against
it
the
boy
said
with
the
same
spark
of
fire
coming
into
his
blue
eyes
which
had
often
been
seen
in
hazel
ones
he
was
like
the
comptons
a
refined
image
of
his
father
with
the
blue
eyes
and
very
dark
hair
which
had
once
made
phil
compton
irresistible
pippo
had
the
habit
i
am
sorry
to
say
of
being
a
little
impatient
with
his
grandmother
her
objections
seemed
and
obsolete
at
the
first
glance
the
chief
thing
against
it
is
that
i
do
think
your
mother
would
wish
it
pippo
mamma
think
me
a
bore
perhaps
the
lad
cried
with
a
laugh
of
almost
scornful
amusement
at
this
ridiculous
idea
she
would
never
of
course
think
you
a
bore
in
any
circumstances
but
she
will
be
very
much
confined
she
could
not
take
you
with
her
to
lawyers
offices
she
will
scarcely
have
any
time
to
herself
what
is
this
mysterious
business
granny
indeed
pippo
i
can
scarcely
tell
you
it
is
something
connected
with
old
times
that
she
wishes
to
have
settled
and
done
with
i
did
not
inquire
very
closely
neither
i
think
should
you
you
know
your
poor
mother
has
had
troubles
in
her
life
has
she
said
pippo
with
wide
open
eyes
i
have
never
seen
any
i
think
perhaps
do
you
know
granny
ladies
make
mountains
of
molehills
or
so
at
least
people
say
do
they
said
dennistoun
with
a
laugh
so
you
have
begun
to
learn
that
sort
of
thing
already
pippo
even
here
at
the
end
of
the
world
pippo
was
a
little
mortified
by
her
laugh
and
a
little
ashamed
of
what
he
had
said
it
is
very
tempting
at
eighteen
to
put
on
a
superiority
yet
he
was
conscious
that
it
was
perhaps
a
little
ungenerous
he
who
owed
all
that
he
was
and
had
to
these
two
ladies
but
naturally
he
was
the
more
angry
because
of
this
i
suppose
he
said
that
what
is
in
every
book
that
ever
was
written
is
likely
to
be
true
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
question
i
wo
do
anything
against
you
if
you
forbid
me
absolutely
granny
but
short
of
that
i
will
go
dennistoun
looked
at
the
boy
with
all
the
heat
in
him
of
his
first
burst
of
independence
it
is
only
wise
to
compute
the
forces
opposed
to
one
before
one
launches
a
command
which
one
may
not
have
force
to
ensure
obedience
to
he
said
that
he
would
not
disobey
her
absolutely
with
his
lips
but
his
eyes
expressed
a
less
dutiful
sentiment
she
had
no
mind
to
be
beaten
in
such
a
struggle
elinor
had
complained
of
her
mother
in
her
youth
that
she
was
too
reasonable
too
unwilling
to
command
too
reluctant
to
assume
the
responsibility
of
an
act
and
it
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
she
had
mended
of
this
in
all
the
experience
she
had
had
of
her
impatient
daughter
and
under
the
influence
of
so
many
additional
years
she
looked
at
philip
and
concluded
that
he
would
at
least
find
some
way
of
eluding
her
authority
if
she
exercised
it
and
it
did
not
consist
with
her
dignity
to
be
either
absolutely
or
partially
disobeyed
you
forget
she
said
that
i
have
never
taken
such
authority
upon
me
since
you
were
a
child
i
will
not
forbid
you
to
do
what
you
have
set
your
heart
upon
i
can
only
say
philip
that
i
do
think
your
mother
would
wish
you
to
go
if
that
all
granny
said
the
boy
i
think
i
can
take
my
mother
into
my
own
hands
but
why
do
you
call
me
philip
you
never
call
me
that
but
when
you
are
angry
was
i
ever
angry
she
said
with
a
smile
but
if
we
are
to
consider
you
a
man
looking
down
upon
women
and
taking
your
movements
upon
your
own
responsibility
my
dear
it
would
be
ridiculous
that
you
should
be
little
pippo
any
more
not
little
pippo
he
said
with
a
boyish
complacent
laugh
rising
up
to
his
full
height
a
young
man
nearly
six
feet
high
with
a
scholarship
in
his
pocket
how
is
he
to
be
expected
to
take
the
law
from
his
old
grandmother
as
to
what
he
is
to
do
and
young
philip
did
go
to
town
triumphantly
by
the
night
mail
he
had
never
done
such
a
thing
before
and
his
sense
of
manly
independence
of
daring
almost
of
adventure
was
more
delightful
than
words
could
say
there
was
not
even
any
one
except
the
man
who
had
driven
him
into
penrith
to
see
him
away
he
who
was
generally
accompanied
to
the
last
minute
by
precautions
and
admonitions
and
farewells
to
feel
himself
dart
away
into
the
night
with
nobody
to
look
back
to
on
the
platform
no
gaze
half
smiling
half
tearful
to
follow
him
was
of
itself
an
emancipation
to
pippo
he
was
a
good
boy
and
no
rebel
against
the
double
maternal
bond
which
had
lain
so
lightly
yet
so
closely
upon
him
all
his
life
it
was
only
for
a
year
or
two
that
he
had
suspected
that
this
was
unusual
or
even
imagined
that
for
a
growing
man
the
sway
of
two
ladies
and
even
their
devotion
might
make
others
smile
perhaps
he
had
been
a
little
more
particular
in
his
notions
in
his
manners
in
his
fastidious
dislike
to
dirt
and
careless
habits
than
was
common
in
the
somewhat
rough
north
country
school
which
had
so
risen
in
scholastic
note
under
the
last
head
master
but
which
was
very
far
from
the
refinements
of
eton
and
lately
it
had
begun
to
dawn
upon
him
that
a
mother
and
a
grandmother
to
watch
over
him
and
care
for
him
in
everything
might
be
perhaps
a
little
absurd
for
a
young
man
of
his
advanced
age
thus
his
escapade
which
was
against
the
will
of
his
elder
guardian
and
without
the
knowledge
of
his
mother
which
was
entirely
his
own
act
and
on
his
own
responsibility
went
to
philip
head
and
gave
him
a
sort
of
intoxication
of
pleasure
that
his
mother
should
be
displeased
really
displeased
should
not
want
him
incredible
thought
never
entered
into
his
mind
save
as
an
accountable
delusion
of
granny
his
mother
not
want
him
all
the
arguments
in
the
world
would
never
have
got
that
into
young
pippo
head
dennistoun
waking
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
to
think
of
the
boy
rushing
on
through
the
dark
on
his
adventurous
way
recollected
only
then
with
much
confusion
and
pain
that
she
ought
to
have
telegraphed
to
elinor
who
might
be
so
engaged
as
to
make
it
very
embarrassing
for
her
in
her
strange
circumstances
to
see
pippo
that
the
boy
was
coming
in
her
agitation
she
had
forgotten
this
precaution
was
it
perhaps
true
as
the
young
ones
thought
that
she
was
getting
a
little
slower
in
her
movements
a
little
dulled
in
her
thoughts
chapter
xl
john
tatham
had
in
vain
attempted
to
persuade
elinor
to
come
to
his
house
to
dine
there
in
comfort
he
was
going
out
himself
so
that
at
least
in
this
time
of
excitement
and
trouble
she
might
have
the
careful
service
and
admirable
comfort
of
his
house
elinor
preferred
her
favourite
lodgings
and
a
cup
of
tea
to
all
the
luxuries
of
halkin
street
and
she
was
fit
for
no
more
consultations
that
night
she
had
many
many
things
to
think
of
and
some
new
which
as
yet
she
barely
comprehended
the
rooms
in
ebury
street
were
small
and
they
were
more
or
less
dingy
as
such
rooms
are
but
they
were
comfortable
enough
and
had
as
much
of
home
to
elinor
as
repeated
visits
there
with
all
her
belongings
could
give
them
the
room
in
which
she
slept
was
next
to
that
in
which
her
boy
had
usually
slept
that
was
enough
to
make
it
no
strange
place
and
i
need
not
say
that
it
became
the
scene
of
many
discussions
during
the
few
days
that
followed
the
papers
by
this
time
were
full
of
the
strange
trial
which
was
coming
on
the
romance
of
commercial
life
and
ruin
the
guilty
man
who
had
been
absent
so
long
enjoying
his
gains
and
who
now
was
dragged
back
into
the
light
to
give
an
account
of
himself
and
of
other
guilt
perhaps
less
black
than
his
own
yet
dreadful
enough
to
hear
of
the
story
of
the
destroyed
books
was
a
most
remarkable
and
picturesque
incident
in
the
narrative
the
leading
papers
looked
up
their
own
account
of
the
facts
given
at
the
time
and
pointed
out
how
evidently
justified
by
the
new
facts
made
known
to
the
public
was
the
theory
they
had
themselves
given
forth
as
these
theories
however
were
very
different
and
as
all
claimed
to
be
right
perhaps
the
conclusion
was
less
certain
than
this
announcement
gave
warrant
to
believe
but
each
and
all
promised
revelations
of
the
most
surprising
kind
involving
some
of
the
highest
aristocracy
the
democratic
papers
said
bringing
to
light
an
exciting
story
of
the
private
relations
between
husband
and
wife
said
those
of
society
and
revealing
a
piquant
chapter
of
social
history
hushed
up
at
the
time
it
was
a
modest
print
indeed
that
contented
itself
with
the
statement
that
its
readers
would
find
a
romance
of
real
life
involved
in
the
trial
which
was
about
to
take
place
elinor
did
not
fortunately
see
all
these
comments
the
and
the
were
dignified
and
reticent
and
she
did
not
read
and
was
indeed
scarcely
cognisant
of
the
existence
of
most
of
the
others
but
the
faintest
reference
to
the
trial
was
enough
it
need
hardly
be
said
to
make
the
blood
boil
in
her
veins
it
was
a
curious
thing
in
her
state
of
mind
and
with
the
feelings
she
had
towards
her
husband
family
that
one
of
the
first
things
she
did
on
establishing
herself
in
her
ebury
street
rooms
was
to
look
for
an
old
peerage
which
had
lain
for
several
years
she
remembered
on
a
certain
shelf
genteel
lodgings
in
ebury
street
which
did
not
possess
somewhere
an
old
peerage
would
be
out
of
the
world
indeed
she
found
it
in
the
same
corner
as
of
old
where
she
had
noted
it
so
often
and
avoided
it
as
if
it
had
been
a
serpent
but
now
the
first
thing
she
did
as
soon
as
her
tray
was
brought
her
and
all
necessary
explanations
given
and
the
door
shut
was
to
take
the
book
furtively
from
its
place
almost
as
if
she
were
afraid
of
what
she
should
see
what
a
list
there
was
of
sons
of
lord
serf
some
she
had
never
known
who
died
young
and
reginald
in
india
and
hal
who
was
so
kind
what
a
good
laugh
he
had
she
remembered
not
a
joyless
cackle
like
mariamne
a
good
natural
laugh
and
a
kind
light
in
his
eyes
and
he
had
been
kind
she
could
remember
ever
so
many
things
nothings
things
that
made
a
little
difference
in
the
dull
dull
cloudy
sky
of
a
neglected
wife
poor
hal
and
he
too
was
gone
and
serf
dying
and
pippo
the
heir
pippo
was
perhaps
for
any
thing
she
knew
lord
lomond
now
to
say
that
this
did
not
startle
elinor
did
not
make
her
heart
beat
did
not
open
new
complications
and
vistas
in
life
would
be
a
thing
impossible
pippo
lord
lomond
pippo
whom
she
had
feared
to
expose
to
his
father
influence
whom
she
had
kept
apart
who
did
not
know
anything
about
himself
except
that
he
was
her
son
had
she
kept
and
guarded
the
boy
thus
in
the
very
obscurity
of
life
in
the
stillest
and
most
protected
circumstances
only
to
plunge
him
suddenly
at
last
without
preparation
without
warning
into
the
fiery
furnace
of
temptation
into
a
region
where
he
might
pardonably
perhaps
put
himself
beyond
her
influence
beyond
her
guidance
poor
elinor
and
yet
she
was
not
wholly
to
be
pitied
either
for
her
heart
was
fired
by
the
thought
of
her
boy
elevation
in
spite
of
herself
it
did
not
occur
to
her
that
such
an
elevation
for
him
meant
something
also
for
her
that
view
of
the
case
she
did
not
take
into
consideration
for
a
moment
nay
she
did
not
think
of
it
but
that
pippo
should
be
lord
lomond
went
through
her
like
an
arrow
like
an
arrow
that
gave
a
wound
acute
and
sharp
yet
no
pain
if
such
a
thing
could
be
said
that
he
should
discover
his
father
had
been
the
danger
before
her
all
his
life
but
if
he
must
find
out
that
he
had
a
father
that
was
a
way
in
which
it
might
not
be
all
pain
i
do
not
pretend
that
she
was
very
clear
in
all
these
thoughts
indeed
she
was
not
clear
at
all
john
tatham
knowing
but
one
side
had
begun
to
think
vaguely
of
elinor
what
elinor
thought
of
her
mother
that
her
mind
was
not
quite
as
of
old
not
so
bright
nor
so
vivid
not
so
clear
in
coming
to
a
conclusion
had
he
known
everything
he
might
not
have
been
so
sure
even
on
that
point
but
then
had
he
known
everything
that
elinor
knew
and
been
aware
of
what
it
was
which
elinor
had
been
summoned
by
all
the
force
of
old
fidelity
and
the
honour
of
her
name
to
do
john
would
have
been
too
much
horrified
to
have
been
able
to
form
an
opinion
no
poor
elinor
was
not
at
all
clear
in
her
thoughts
less
clear
than
ever
after
these
revelations
the
way
before
her
seemed
dark
in
whatever
way
she
looked
at
it
complications
were
round
her
on
every
side
she
had
instinctively
without
a
word
said
given
up
that
idea
of
flight
who
was
it
that
said
the
heir
to
a
peerage
could
not
be
hid
john
had
said
it
she
remembered
and
john
was
always
right
if
she
was
to
take
him
away
to
the
uttermost
end
of
the
earth
they
would
seek
him
out
and
find
him
and
then
there
was
his
father
who
had
known
all
the
time
had
known
and
never
disturbed
her
no
wonder
that
poor
elinor
thoughts
were
mixed
and
complicated
she
walked
up
and
down
the
room
not
thinking
but
letting
crowds
and
flights
of
thoughts
like
birds
fly
through
her
mind
no
longer
clear
indeed
as
she
had
been
wont
to
be
no
longer
coming
to
sudden
sharp
conclusions
admitting
possibilities
of
which
elinor
once
upon
a
time
would
never
have
thought
and
day
by
day
as
he
saw
her
john
tatham
understood
her
less
and
less
he
did
not
know
what
she
meant
what
she
was
going
to
do
what
were
her
sentiments
towards
her
husband
what
were
her
intentions
towards
her
son
he
had
found
out
a
great
deal
about
the
case
merely
as
a
case
and
it
began
to
be
clear
to
him
where
elinor
part
came
in
elinor
compton
could
not
have
appeared
on
her
husband
behalf
and
whether
there
might
not
arise
a
question
whether
being
now
his
wife
her
evidence
could
be
taken
on
what
had
happened
before
she
was
his
wife
was
by
no
means
sure
why
did
they
call
your
mother
john
said
as
dennistoun
also
had
said
but
he
did
not
at
all
understand
how
could
he
the
dismay
that
came
over
elinor
and
the
not
for
the
world
which
came
from
her
lips
he
had
come
in
to
see
her
in
the
morning
as
he
went
down
to
his
chambers
on
the
very
morning
when
pippo
quite
unexpected
and
also
not
at
all
desired
was
arriving
at
euston
square
it
would
have
been
much
better
he
said
in
every
way
if
they
had
called
your
mother
who
of
course
must
know
exactly
what
you
know
elinor
in
respect
to
this
matter
no
said
elinor
with
dry
lips
she
knows
nothing
she
calculates
back
by
little
incidents
she
does
not
remember
i
do
that
natural
i
suppose
said
john
with
an
impatient
sigh
and
a
look
still
my
aunt
would
do
no
good
at
all
you
may
believe
me
john
do
let
us
speak
of
this
any
more
i
know
what
has
to
be
done
my
mother
would
twist
herself
up
among
her
calculations
about
alick
hudson
examination
and
i
know
not
what
whereas
i
there
is
nothing
nothing
more
to
be
said
i
thought
i
could
escape
and
it
is
your
doing
if
i
now
see
that
i
can
not
escape
i
can
but
hope
that
providence
will
protect
my
boy
he
is
at
school
where
they
have
little
time
for
reading
the
papers
he
may
never
even
see
or
at
least
if
he
does
he
may
think
it
is
another
compton
some
one
whom
he
never
heard
of
and
how
if
he
becomes
lord
lomond
as
i
said
before
the
secret
is
out
oh
john
cried
elinor
wringing
her
hands
do
do
torment
me
with
that
idea
now
let
only
this
be
past
and
then
oh
i
see
i
see
i
am
not
a
fool
i
perceive
that
i
can
not
hide
him
as
you
say
if
that
happens
but
oh
john
for
pity
sake
let
this
be
over
first
let
us
not
hurry
everything
on
at
the
same
time
he
is
at
school
what
do
schoolboys
care
for
the
newspapers
especially
for
trials
in
the
law
courts
oh
let
this
be
over
first
a
boy
at
school
and
he
need
never
know
it
was
at
this
moment
that
a
hansom
drew
up
and
a
rattling
peal
came
at
the
door
hansoms
are
not
rare
in
ebury
street
and
how
can
one
tell
in
these
small
houses
if
the
peal
is
at
one
door
or
the
next
elinor
was
not
disturbed
she
paid
no
attention
she
expected
no
one
she
was
afraid
of
nothing
new
for
the
present
surely
surely
as
she
said
there
was
enough
for
the
present
it
did
not
seem
possible
that
any
new
incident
should
come
now
i
do
not
want
to
torment
you
elinor
you
may
imagine
i
would
be
the
last
i
would
only
save
you
if
i
could
from
what
must
be
what
what
who
this
philip
the
boy
the
door
had
burst
open
with
an
eager
impatient
hand
upon
it
and
there
stood
upon
the
threshold
in
all
the
mingled
excitement
and
fatigue
of
his
night
journey
pale
sleep
in
his
eyes
yet
happy
expectation
exultation
the
certainty
of
open
arms
to
receive
him
and
cries
of
delight
the
boy
he
stood
for
a
second
looking
into
the
strange
yet
familiar
room
john
tatham
had
sprung
to
his
feet
and
stood
startled
hesitating
while
young
philip
eyes
noting
him
with
a
glance
flashed
past
him
to
the
other
more
important
more
beloved
the
mother
whom
he
had
expected
to
rush
towards
him
with
an
outcry
of
joy
and
elinor
sat
still
in
her
chair
struck
dumb
grown
pale
like
a
ghost
her
eyes
wide
open
her
lips
apart
the
sight
of
the
boy
her
beloved
child
her
pride
and
delight
was
as
a
horrible
spectacle
to
elinor
she
stared
at
him
like
one
horrified
and
neither
moved
nor
spoke
elinor
cried
john
terrified
there
nothing
wrong
do
you
see
it
philip
boy
what
do
you
mean
by
giving
her
such
a
fright
fainting
i
believe
i
give
her
a
fright
cried
half
in
anguish
half
in
indignation
the
astonished
boy
no
i
not
fainting
pippo
there
nothing
wrong
at
home
elinor
cried
holding
out
her
hand
to
him
coming
to
herself
which
meant
only
awakening
to
the
horror
of
a
danger
far
more
present
than
she
had
ever
dreamt
and
to
the
sudden
sight
not
of
her
boy
but
of
that
nemesis
which
she
had
so
carefully
prepared
for
herself
and
which
had
been
awaiting
her
for
years
she
was
not
afraid
of
anything
wrong
at
home
it
was
the
first
shield
she
could
find
in
the
shock
which
had
almost
paralysed
her
to
conceal
her
terror
and
distress
at
the
sight
of
him
from
the
astonished
disappointed
mortified
and
angry
boy
i
thought
he
said
you
would
have
been
glad
to
see
me
mother
no
there
nothing
wrong
at
home
thank
heaven
for
that
cried
elinor
feeling
herself
more
and
more
a
hypocrite
as
she
recovered
from
the
shock
pippo
i
was
saying
this
moment
that
you
were
at
school
the
words
were
scarcely
off
my
lips
and
then
to
see
you
in
a
moment
standing
there
i
thought
he
repeated
again
trembling
with
the
disappointment
and
mortification
wounded
in
his
cheerful
confident
affection
and
in
his
young
pride
the
monarch
of
all
he
surveyed
i
thought
you
would
have
been
pleased
to
see
me
mother
of
course
said
john
cheerfully
your
mother
is
glad
to
see
you
and
so
am
i
you
impetuous
boy
though
you
do
take
the
trouble
of
shaking
hands
with
me
he
wants
to
be
kissed
and
coddled
elinor
and
i
must
be
off
to
my
chambers
but
i
should
like
to
know
first
what
up
boy
you
got
something
to
say
pippo
what
is
it
my
dearest
you
did
give
me
a
great
fright
and
i
am
still
nervous
a
little
tell
me
pippo
something
has
brought
you
your
uncle
john
is
right
i
can
see
it
in
your
eyes
you
got
something
to
tell
me
the
tired
and
excited
boy
looked
from
one
to
another
two
faces
both
full
of
a
veiled
but
intense
anxiety
looking
at
him
as
if
what
they
expected
was
no
good
news
he
burst
out
into
a
big
hoarse
laugh
the
only
way
to
keep
himself
from
crying
you
do
even
seem
to
remember
anything
about
it
he
cried
flinging
himself
down
in
the
nearest
chair
and
for
my
part
i
do
care
any
longer
whether
any
one
knows
or
not
and
elinor
whose
thoughts
were
on
such
different
things
whose
whole
mind
was
absorbed
in
the
question
of
what
he
could
have
heard
about
the
trial
about
his
father
about
the
new
and
strange
future
before
him
gazed
at
him
with
eyes
that
seemed
hollowed
out
all
round
with
devouring
anxiety
what
is
it
she
said
what
is
it
for
god
sake
tell
me
what
have
you
heard
it
goes
against
all
prejudices
to
imagine
that
john
tatham
a
man
who
never
had
had
a
child
an
old
bachelor
not
too
tolerant
of
youth
should
have
divined
the
boy
better
than
his
mother
but
he
did
perhaps
because
he
was
a
lawyer
and
accustomed
to
investigate
the
human
countenance
and
eye
he
saw
that
philip
was
full
of
something
of
his
own
immediately
interesting
to
himself
and
he
cast
about
quickly
in
his
mind
what
it
could
be
not
that
the
boy
was
heir
to
a
peerage
he
would
never
have
come
like
to
announce
but
something
that
philip
was
cruelly
disappointed
his
mother
did
not
remember
this
passed
through
john
mind
like
a
flash
though
it
takes
a
long
time
to
describe
ah
he
said
i
begin
to
divine
was
not
there
something
about
a
scholarship
pippo
cried
elinor
lighting
up
great
lamps
of
relief
of
sudden
ease
and
quick
coming
joy
in
her
brightened
eyes
and
face
my
boy
won
your
battle
you
got
it
you
got
it
pippo
and
your
foolish
stupid
mother
that
thought
for
a
moment
you
could
rush
to
her
like
this
with
anything
but
good
news
it
took
a
few
moments
to
soothe
pippo
down
and
mend
his
wounded
feelings
i
began
to
think
nobody
cared
he
said
and
that
made
me
that
i
did
care
myself
i
rather
musgrave
had
got
it
if
it
had
not
been
to
please
you
all
and
you
never
seemed
so
much
as
to
remember
only
uncle
john
he
added
after
a
moment
with
a
half
scorn
which
made
john
laugh
at
the
candour
of
youth
only
the
least
important
of
all
he
said
it
was
atrocious
of
the
ladies
philip
shake
hands
my
boy
i
owe
you
five
pounds
for
the
scholarship
and
now
i
take
myself
off
which
will
please
you
most
of
all
he
went
laughing
to
himself
all
the
way
but
got
suddenly
quite
grave
as
he
stepped
outside
whether
because
he
remembered
that
it
does
not
become
a
and
to
laugh
in
the
street
or
for
other
causes
it
does
not
become
us
to
attempt
to
say
and
elinor
meanwhile
made
it
up
to
her
boy
amply
and
while
her
heart
ached
with
the
question
what
to
do
with
him
how
to
dispose
of
him
during
those
dreadful
following
days
behaved
herself
as
if
her
head
too
was
half
turned
with
joy
and
exultation
only
tempered
by
the
regret
that
musgrave
who
had
worked
so
hard
could
not
have
got
the
scholarship
too
chapter
xli
elinor
made
much
of
her
boy
during
that
day
and
the
following
days
to
take
away
the
sense
of
disappointment
which
even
after
the
first
great
mortification
was
got
over
still
haunted
young
philip
mind
it
surprised
him
beyond
measure
to
find
that
she
did
not
wish
to
go
out
with
him
indeed
in
so
far
as
was
possible
avoided
it
altogether
save
for
a
hurried
drive
to
a
few
places
during
which
she
kept
her
veil
down
and
sheltered
herself
with
an
umbrella
in
the
most
ridiculous
way
are
you
afraid
of
your
complexion
mother
the
boy
asked
of
her
with
disdain
it
looks
like
it
she
said
but
with
a
laugh
that
was
full
of
embarrassment
though
it
is
a
little
late
in
the
day
elinor
was
perhaps
better
aware
than
pippo
was
that
she
had
a
complexion
which
a
girl
might
have
envied
and
was
still
as
fresh
as
a
rose
notwithstanding
that
she
was
a
year
or
two
over
forty
but
i
need
not
say
it
was
not
of
her
complexion
she
was
thinking
she
had
been
careful
to
choose
her
time
on
previous
visits
to
london
so
as
to
risk
as
little
as
possible
the
chance
of
meeting
her
husband
but
now
there
was
no
doubt
that
he
was
in
town
and
not
the
least
that
if
he
met
her
anywhere
with
pippo
her
secret
so
far
as
it
had
ever
been
a
secret
would
be
in
his
hands
even
when
john
took
the
boy
out
it
was
with
a
beating
heart
that
his
mother
saw
him
go
for
john
was
too
well
known
to
make
any
secret
possible
about
his
movements
or
who
it
was
who
was
with
him
perhaps
it
was
for
this
reason
that
john
desired
to
take
him
out
and
even
cut
short
his
day
work
on
one
or
two
occasions
to
act
as
cicerone
to
philip
he
took
him
to
the
house
to
the
great
excitement
and
delight
of
the
boy
who
only
wished
that
the
entertainment
could
have
been
made
complete
by
a
speech
from
uncle
john
which
was
a
point
in
which
his
guide
philosopher
and
friend
though
in
every
other
way
so
complaisant
did
not
humour
pippo
on
one
occasion
during
the
first
week
they
had
an
encounter
which
made
john
pulses
move
a
little
quicker
when
they
were
walking
along
through
hyde
park
having
strolled
that
way
in
the
fading
of
the
may
afternoon
when
the
carriages
were
still
promenading
up
and
down
before
they
returned
to
halkin
street
to
dinner
where
elinor
awaited
them
it
happened
to
tatham
to
meet
the
roving
eyes
of
lady
mariamne
who
lay
back
languidly
in
her
carriage
wrapped
in
a
fur
cloak
and
shivering
in
the
chill
of
the
evening
she
was
not
particularly
interested
in
anything
or
any
person
whom
she
had
seen
and
was
a
little
cross
and
desirous
of
getting
home
but
when
she
saw
john
she
roused
up
immediately
and
gave
a
sign
to
dolly
who
sat
by
her
to
pull
the
mr
tatham
she
cried
in
her
shrill
voice
lady
mariamne
was
not
one
of
the
people
who
object
to
hear
their
voice
in
public
or
are
reluctant
to
make
their
wishes
known
to
everybody
she
felt
herself
to
be
of
the
cast
in
which
everybody
is
interested
and
that
the
public
liked
to
know
whom
she
honoured
with
her
acquaintance
tatham
are
you
going
to
carry
your
rudeness
so
far
as
not
to
seem
to
know
me
oh
come
here
this
moment
you
impertinent
man
can
i
be
of
any
use
to
you
lady
mariamne
said
john
gravely
at
the
carriage
door
oh
dear
no
you
ca
be
of
any
use
what
should
i
have
those
men
for
if
i
wanted
you
to
be
of
use
come
and
talk
a
moment
that
all
or
get
into
the
carriage
and
i
take
you
anywhere
dolly
and
i
have
driven
round
and
round
and
we
have
not
seen
a
creature
we
cared
to
see
yes
there
was
a
darling
darling
little
maltese
terrier
with
white
silk
curls
hanging
over
his
eyes
on
an
odious
woman
lap
but
i
can
not
expect
you
to
find
that
angel
for
me
tatham
who
is
that
tall
boy
pippo
said
john
quickly
though
probably
he
had
never
in
his
life
before
used
that
name
which
he
disapproved
of
angrily
as
people
often
do
of
a
childish
name
which
does
not
please
them
go
on
i
come
after
you
directly
the
boy
is
a
cousin
of
mine
lady
mariamne
just
from
school
tatham
i
am
quite
sure
it
is
nell
boy
call
after
him
his
name
bring
him
back
john
thomas
run
after
that
young
gentleman
and
say
with
my
compliments
nothing
said
john
stopping
the
footman
with
a
lifted
hand
and
a
still
more
emphatic
look
he
is
hastening
home
to
an
engagement
and
it
evident
i
had
better
go
too
for
your
little
friend
there
is
showing
his
teeth
the
darling
said
lady
mariamne
did
it
show
its
little
pearls
at
the
wicked
man
that
will
not
do
what
its
mummy
says
dolly
ca
you
jump
down
and
run
after
that
boy
i
am
sure
it
is
your
uncle
philip
boy
he
is
out
of
sight
mother
said
miss
dolly
calmly
you
are
the
most
dreadful
wicked
unkind
people
all
of
you
show
its
little
teeth
then
darling
oo
the
only
one
that
has
any
feeling
tatham
do
tell
me
something
about
this
trial
what
is
going
to
be
done
phil
is
mixed
up
in
it
i
know
he
is
can
they
do
anything
to
anybody
after
all
this
time
they
ca
make
you
pay
up
i
know
after
a
certain
time
oh
could
it
all
be
hushed
up
and
stopped
and
kept
out
of
the
newspapers
i
hate
the
newspapers
always
chuckling
over
every
new
discovery
but
this
can
not
be
called
a
new
discovery
if
true
it
old
as
old
as
the
old
beginning
of
the
world
do
you
think
somebody
could
get
at
the
newspaper
men
and
have
it
hushed
up
i
doubt
if
you
could
get
hold
of
all
of
them
their
name
is
legion
said
john
oh
i
do
care
what
their
name
is
if
you
will
help
me
tatham
we
could
get
hold
of
most
of
them
wo
you
you
know
do
you
poor
serf
is
so
bad
it
may
be
over
any
day
and
then
only
think
what
a
complication
dolly
turn
your
head
the
other
way
look
at
that
silly
young
huntsfield
capering
about
to
catch
your
eye
i
do
want
you
to
hear
what
i
have
got
to
say
i
do
in
the
least
way
want
to
hear
what
you
have
got
to
say
dear
mamma
said
dolly
that
would
have
made
me
listen
to
every
word
said
lady
mariamne
but
girls
are
more
queer
nowadays
than
anything
that
ever
was
tatham
she
put
her
hand
upon
his
which
was
on
the
carriage
door
and
bent
her
perfumed
powdered
face
towards
him
for
goodness
sake
think
how
awkward
it
would
be
a
man
just
succeeding
to
a
title
and
that
sort
of
thing
put
in
all
the
papers
about
him
do
do
stop
it
or
try
something
to
stop
it
for
goodness
sake
i
assure
you
said
john
i
can
do
nothing
to
stop
it
i
am
as
powerless
as
you
are
oh
i
do
say
that
i
am
powerless
said
lady
mariamne
with
her
shrill
laugh
one
has
one
little
ways
of
influence
then
she
put
her
hand
again
upon
john
with
a
sudden
grip
tatham
she
said
tell
me
in
confidence
was
that
phil
boy
i
have
told
you
lady
mariamne
it
is
a
nephew
of
mine
a
nephew
oh
i
know
what
kind
of
a
nephew
la
mode
de
she
turned
her
head
to
the
other
side
where
her
daughter
was
gazing
calmly
in
front
of
her
dolly
i
was
sure
of
it
she
cried
do
you
hear
dolly
do
you
hear
which
mamma
said
dolly
gravely
of
course
i
could
not
help
hearing
it
all
which
part
was
i
to
notice
about
the
newspapers
or
about
the
boy
lady
mariamne
appealed
to
earth
and
heaven
with
the
loud
cackle
of
her
laugh
he
ca
deny
it
she
said
he
as
good
as
owns
it
i
am
certain
that
the
boy
that
will
be
lomond
uncle
serf
is
not
dead
yet
said
dolly
reprovingly
poor
serf
but
he
so
very
bad
said
lady
mariamne
that
almost
the
same
thing
tatham
ca
we
take
you
anywhere
i
so
glad
i
seen
nell
boy
ca
we
drive
you
home
perhaps
you
got
nell
there
too
john
stood
back
from
the
carriage
door
just
in
time
to
escape
the
start
of
the
horses
as
the
remorseless
string
was
touched
and
the
footman
clambered
up
into
his
seat
lady
mariamne
smile
went
off
her
face
and
she
had
forgotten
all
about
it
to
judge
from
appearances
before
he
had
got
himself
in
motion
again
and
a
little
farther
on
behind
the
next
tree
he
found
young
philip
waiting
full
of
curiosity
and
questions
who
was
that
lady
uncle
john
was
she
asking
about
me
i
thought
i
heard
her
call
i
had
half
a
mind
to
run
back
and
say
i
am
it
was
much
better
that
you
did
do
anything
of
the
kind
never
pay
any
attention
when
you
think
you
hear
a
fine
lady
calling
you
philip
it
is
better
not
to
hear
the
siren
call
when
they
elderly
sirens
like
that
said
the
boy
with
a
laugh
but
i
say
uncle
john
if
you
wo
tell
me
who
the
lady
is
who
is
the
girl
she
has
a
pair
of
eyes
not
like
sirens
though
eyes
that
go
through
you
like
like
a
pair
of
lancets
a
surgical
operation
in
fact
and
i
should
wonder
if
she
meant
to
be
a
doctor
said
john
the
mother
has
done
nothing
all
her
life
therefore
the
daughter
means
to
do
much
it
is
the
natural
reaction
of
the
generations
but
i
never
noticed
that
miss
dolly
had
any
eyes
to
speak
of
said
the
highly
indifferent
man
the
boy
flushed
with
a
sense
of
indignation
perhaps
you
think
the
old
lady
were
finer
he
said
i
never
admired
the
old
lady
as
you
call
her
said
john
shortly
and
then
he
turned
philip
attention
to
something
possibly
with
the
easily
satisfied
conviction
of
a
spectator
that
the
boy
thought
of
it
no
more
we
met
my
lady
mariamne
in
the
park
he
said
to
elinor
when
they
sat
at
dinner
an
hour
later
at
that
bachelor
table
in
halkin
street
where
everything
was
so
exquisitely
cared
for
it
was
like
elinor
but
most
unlike
the
place
in
which
she
found
herself
that
she
started
so
violently
as
to
shake
the
whole
table
crying
out
in
a
tone
of
consternation
john
as
if
he
did
not
know
very
well
what
he
might
venture
to
say
or
as
if
he
had
any
intention
of
betraying
her
to
her
son
she
was
very
anxious
he
said
perhaps
playing
a
little
with
her
excitement
to
have
philip
presented
to
her
but
i
sent
him
on
that
is
to
say
i
thought
i
sent
him
on
the
fellow
went
no
farther
than
to
the
next
tree
where
he
stood
and
watched
miss
dolly
not
feeling
any
interest
in
the
old
lady
as
he
said
well
uncle
john
did
you
expect
me
to
look
at
the
old
lady
you
are
not
so
fond
of
old
ladies
yourself
and
who
is
miss
dolly
said
elinor
trying
to
conceal
the
beating
of
her
heart
and
the
quiver
on
her
lips
with
a
smile
and
then
she
added
with
a
little
catch
of
her
breath
oh
yes
i
remember
there
was
a
little
girl
you
will
be
surprised
to
hear
that
we
are
by
way
of
being
great
friends
her
ladyship
visits
me
in
my
chambers
again
elinor
uttered
that
startled
cry
john
but
she
tried
this
time
to
cover
it
with
a
tremulous
laugh
are
you
becoming
a
flirt
in
your
old
age
it
appears
so
said
john
and
then
he
added
that
aphorism
which
struck
you
as
it
struck
me
elinor
by
its
good
sense
about
the
heir
to
a
peerage
is
really
her
production
and
not
mine
miss
dolly
and
what
was
the
aphorism
uncle
john
cried
philip
no
it
was
not
miss
dolly
my
young
man
it
was
the
mother
and
so
of
course
does
not
interest
you
any
more
it
did
not
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
old
lady
was
supremely
indifferent
to
pippo
but
as
he
looked
up
saying
something
else
which
did
not
bear
upon
the
subject
it
occurred
to
the
boy
as
it
will
sometimes
occur
by
the
merest
chance
to
a
young
observer
to
notice
his
mother
she
caught
his
eye
somehow
in
the
most
accidental
way
and
pippo
was
too
well
acquainted
with
her
looks
not
to
perceive
that
there
was
a
thrill
in
every
line
of
her
countenance
a
slight
nervous
tremble
in
her
hands
and
entire
person
such
as
was
in
no
way
to
be
accounted
for
he
thought
by
anything
that
had
been
said
or
done
there
was
nothing
surely
to
disquiet
her
in
dining
at
uncle
john
the
three
alone
not
even
one
other
guest
to
fill
up
the
vacant
side
of
the
table
philip
had
himself
thought
that
uncle
john
might
have
asked
some
one
to
meet
them
he
should
have
remembered
that
he
himself
philip
was
now
of
an
age
to
dine
out
and
see
a
little
society
and
go
into
the
world
but
what
in
the
name
of
all
that
was
wonderful
was
there
in
this
entertainment
to
agitate
his
mother
and
john
tatham
had
a
look
which
philip
did
not
understand
the
look
of
a
man
who
was
successful
in
argument
who
was
almost
crushing
an
opponent
it
was
as
if
a
duel
had
been
going
on
between
them
and
the
man
was
the
victor
which
as
was
natural
immediately
threw
philip
violently
on
the
other
side
you
not
well
mother
he
said
do
you
think
not
pippo
well
perhaps
you
are
right
london
is
too
much
for
me
i
am
a
country
bird
said
elinor
with
smiling
yet
trembling
lips
you
shall
not
go
to
the
theatre
if
you
are
not
up
to
it
said
the
boy
in
his
imperious
way
she
gave
him
an
affectionate
look
and
then
she
looked
across
the
table
at
john
what
did
that
look
mean
there
was
a
faint
smile
in
it
and
there
was
a
great
deal
which
philip
did
not
understand
things
understood
by
uncle
john
who
was
after
all
what
you
might
call
an
outsider
no
more
and
not
by
him
her
son
could
anything
be
so
monstrous
philip
blazed
up
with
sudden
fire
no
said
john
tatham
i
think
philip
right
we
take
her
home
to
be
coddled
by
her
maid
and
we
go
off
two
wild
young
fellows
to
the
play
by
ourselves
no
said
philip
i
leave
her
to
be
coddled
by
no
maid
i
can
take
care
of
my
mother
myself
my
dear
boy
said
elinor
i
want
no
coddling
but
i
doubt
whether
i
could
stand
the
play
i
like
you
to
go
with
uncle
john
and
then
it
began
to
dawn
upon
philip
that
his
mother
had
never
meant
to
be
of
the
party
and
that
this
was
what
had
been
settled
all
along
he
was
more
angry
more
wounded
and
hurt
in
his
spirit
than
he
had
of
course
the
least
occasion
to
be
he
was
of
opinion
that
his
mother
had
never
had
any
secrets
from
him
that
she
had
taken
him
into
her
confidence
since
he
was
a
small
boy
even
things
that
granny
did
not
know
and
here
all
at
once
there
was
rising
between
them
a
cloud
a
mist
which
there
was
no
reason
for
if
he
had
done
anything
to
make
him
less
worthy
he
would
have
understood
had
there
been
a
bad
report
from
school
had
he
failed
in
his
work
and
disappointed
her
there
might
have
been
some
reason
for
it
but
he
had
done
nothing
of
the
kind
never
before
had
he
been
so
deserving
of
confidence
he
had
got
his
scholarship
he
had
finished
the
first
phase
of
his
education
in
triumph
and
fulfilled
all
her
expectations
and
now
just
at
this
point
of
all
others
just
when
he
was
most
fit
to
understand
most
worthy
of
trust
she
turned
from
him
his
heart
swelled
as
if
it
would
burst
with
anger
first
almost
too
strong
to
be
repressed
and
with
that
sense
of
injured
merit
which
is
of
all
things
the
most
hard
to
bear
it
is
hard
enough
even
when
one
is
aware
one
deserves
no
better
but
to
be
conscious
of
your
worth
and
to
feel
that
you
are
not
appreciated
that
is
indeed
too
much
for
any
one
there
was
not
even
the
satisfaction
of
giving
up
the
play
which
he
had
looked
forward
to
making
a
sacrifice
of
it
to
his
mother
in
which
there
would
have
been
a
severe
pleasure
but
she
did
not
want
him
she
preferred
that
he
should
leave
her
by
herself
to
be
coddled
by
her
maid
as
uncle
john
vulgarly
said
or
perhaps
was
there
somebody
else
coming
some
old
friend
whom
he
knew
nothing
of
somebody
some
one
or
other
like
that
old
witch
in
the
carriage
whom
pippo
was
not
meant
to
know
it
ended
however
in
the
carrying
out
of
the
plan
settled
beforehand
by
those
old
conspirators
the
old
conspirators
do
generally
manage
to
carry
out
their
plans
for
the
management
of
rebellious
youth
however
injured
the
latter
may
feel
pippo
wound
himself
up
in
solemn
dignity
and
silence
when
he
understood
that
it
was
ordained
that
he
should
proceed
to
the
play
with
john
tatham
and
the
pair
had
got
half
way
to
drury
lane
or
it
may
have
been
the
lyceum
or
the
haymarket
or
any
of
other
theatres
for
here
exact
information
fails
before
he
condescended
to
open
his
lips
for
more
than
yes
or
no
but
gloom
did
not
survive
the
raising
of
the
curtain
and
he
had
forgotten
all
offences
and
had
taken
his
companion
into
favour
again
and
was
talking
to
uncle
john
between
the
acts
with
all
the
excitement
of
a
country
youth
to
whom
a
play
still
was
the
greatest
of
novelties
and
delights
when
he
suddenly
saw
a
change
come
over
john
countenance
and
a
slight
bow
of
recognition
directed
towards
a
box
which
made
philip
turn
round
and
look
too
and
there
was
the
old
witch
of
the
carriage
and
what
was
more
interesting
the
girl
with
the
keen
eyes
who
looked
out
suddenly
from
the
shade
of
the
draperies
and
fixed
upon
philip
philip
himself
a
look
which
startled
that
young
hero
much
nor
was
this
all
for
later
in
the
evening
after
another
act
of
the
play
some
one
else
appeared
in
the
same
box
and
fixed
the
dark
and
impassive
stare
of
a
long
pair
of
upon
philip
it
amused
him
at
first
and
afterwards
it
half
frightened
him
and
finally
made
him
very
angry
the
gazer
was
a
man
of
whom
however
philip
could
make
nothing
out
but
his
white
shirt
front
and
his
tall
stature
and
the
long
black
tubes
of
the
was
it
at
him
the
man
was
looking
or
perhaps
at
uncle
john
but
the
boy
thought
it
on
the
whole
unlikely
that
anybody
should
stare
in
that
way
at
anything
so
little
out
of
the
ordinary
as
uncle
john
i
say
he
said
in
the
next
interval
who
is
that
fellow
staring
at
us
out
of
your
old
lady
box
staring
at
the
ladies
behind
us
you
mean
said
john
pippo
do
you
think
we
could
make
a
rush
for
it
the
moment
the
play
over
i
got
something
to
look
over
when
i
get
home
are
you
game
to
be
out
the
very
first
before
the
curtain
down
certainly
i
game
said
philip
delighted
if
you
wish
it
uncle
john
yes
i
wish
it
said
the
other
and
he
put
his
hand
on
the
shoulder
as
the
act
finished
and
the
characters
of
the
piece
drew
together
for
the
final
tableau
and
the
pair
managed
it
triumphantly
and
were
the
very
first
to
get
out
at
the
head
of
the
crowd
to
immense
amusement
and
john
tatham
great
relief
the
elder
hurried
the
younger
into
the
first
hansom
all
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
and
then
for
the
first
time
his
gravity
relaxed
philip
took
it
all
for
a
great
joke
till
they
reached
ebury
street
but
when
his
companion
left
him
and
he
had
time
to
think
of
it
he
began
to
ask
himself
why
chapter
xlii
i
will
not
say
that
philip
sleep
was
broken
by
this
question
but
it
undoubtedly
recurred
to
his
mind
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
when
he
jumped
out
of
bed
very
late
for
breakfast
and
the
events
of
the
past
night
and
the
lateness
of
the
hour
at
which
he
got
to
rest
came
back
upon
him
as
excuses
in
the
first
place
for
his
tardiness
and
then
which
was
remarkable
it
was
not
the
scene
in
the
play
in
which
he
had
been
most
interested
which
came
to
his
mind
but
a
vision
of
that
box
and
the
man
standing
in
front
of
it
staring
at
him
through
the
black
tubes
of
the
which
came
before
philip
like
a
picture
uncle
john
had
said
it
was
at
the
ladies
behind
but
the
boy
felt
sure
it
was
no
lady
behind
but
himself
on
whom
that
stare
was
fixed
who
would
care
to
stare
so
at
him
it
faintly
gleamed
across
his
thoughts
that
it
might
be
some
one
who
had
heard
of
the
scholarship
but
he
dismissed
that
thought
instantly
with
a
blush
it
also
gleamed
upon
him
with
equal
vagueness
like
a
momentary
but
entirely
futile
light
consciously
derived
from
story
books
and
of
which
he
was
much
ashamed
that
the
inexplicable
attention
given
to
himself
might
have
something
to
do
with
the
girl
who
had
such
keen
eyes
philip
blushed
fiery
red
at
this
involuntary
thought
and
chased
it
from
his
mind
like
a
mad
dog
but
he
could
not
put
away
the
picture
of
the
box
the
girl
putting
aside
the
curtain
to
look
at
him
and
the
fixed
upon
his
face
and
then
why
was
uncle
john
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
away
it
had
seemed
a
capital
joke
at
that
moment
but
when
he
came
to
think
of
it
it
was
rather
strange
that
a
man
who
might
be
if
he
liked
and
probably
lord
chancellor
in
a
few
years
should
make
a
schoolboy
rush
from
the
stalls
of
a
theatre
with
the
object
of
being
first
out
philip
disapproved
of
so
undignified
a
step
on
the
part
of
his
elderly
relation
and
he
saw
now
in
the
serious
morning
that
uncle
john
was
very
unlikely
to
have
done
it
for
fun
what
then
did
it
mean
he
came
down
full
of
these
thoughts
and
rather
ashamed
of
being
late
wondering
whether
his
mother
would
have
waited
for
him
which
would
have
annoyed
him
or
if
she
would
have
finished
her
breakfast
which
would
have
annoyed
him
still
more
happily
for
elinor
she
had
hit
the
golden
mean
and
was
pouring
out
for
herself
a
second
cup
of
coffee
but
philip
was
not
aware
it
was
the
second
when
the
boy
appeared
she
was
quite
restored
to
her
usual
serenity
and
freshness
and
as
eager
to
know
how
he
had
enjoyed
himself
as
she
always
was
he
gave
her
a
brief
sketch
of
the
play
and
of
what
pleased
him
in
it
as
in
duty
bound
but
he
added
what
interested
me
almost
more
was
that
we
had
a
sort
of
a
little
play
of
our
own
what
she
cried
with
a
startled
look
in
her
eyes
one
thing
that
puzzled
him
was
that
she
was
so
very
easily
startled
which
it
seemed
to
philip
had
never
been
the
case
before
well
he
said
the
lady
was
there
whom
uncle
john
met
in
the
park
and
the
girl
with
her
and
i
believe
the
little
dog
she
made
all
sorts
of
signs
to
him
but
he
took
scarcely
any
notice
but
that
not
all
mother
it
a
good
deal
pippo
is
it
why
do
you
speak
in
that
choked
voice
mother
i
suppose
it
is
just
one
of
his
society
acquaintances
but
the
thing
was
that
before
the
last
act
somebody
else
came
forward
to
the
front
of
the
box
and
fixed
i
was
going
to
say
his
eyes
i
mean
his
upon
us
philip
had
meant
to
say
upon
me
but
he
had
produced
already
so
great
an
effect
on
his
mother
face
that
he
moderated
instinctively
the
point
of
this
description
and
stared
at
us
he
added
all
the
rest
of
the
time
paying
not
the
least
attention
to
anything
that
was
going
on
it
a
queer
sensation
he
went
on
with
a
laugh
to
feel
that
black
thing
like
the
eyes
of
some
monster
with
no
speculation
in
them
fixed
upon
you
now
i
want
you
to
tell
me
what
the
matter
mother
nothing
pippo
nothing
said
elinor
faintly
stooping
to
lift
up
a
book
she
had
let
fall
go
on
with
your
story
i
am
very
much
interested
and
then
my
dear
mother
cried
philip
i
do
know
what
has
come
over
you
or
over
me
there
something
going
on
i
ca
understand
you
never
used
to
have
any
secrets
from
me
i
was
always
in
your
confidence
was
i
mother
it
was
not
a
book
she
had
let
fall
but
a
ring
that
she
had
dropped
from
her
finger
and
which
had
to
be
followed
over
the
carpet
it
made
her
red
and
flushed
when
she
half
raised
her
head
to
say
yes
pippo
you
know
i
have
always
told
you
philip
did
not
remark
that
what
his
mother
said
was
nothing
after
all
he
got
up
to
help
her
to
look
for
her
ring
and
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
as
she
knelt
on
the
floor
yes
mamma
he
said
tenderly
protectingly
i
do
know
but
something
changed
either
it
in
me
that
makes
you
feel
you
trust
me
or
else
it
is
in
you
and
i
do
know
which
would
be
worst
there
is
no
change
she
said
after
a
moment
for
she
could
not
help
the
ring
being
found
and
immediately
when
his
quick
young
eyes
came
to
the
search
but
she
did
not
look
him
in
the
face
there
is
no
change
dear
there
is
only
some
worrying
business
which
involves
a
great
many
troubles
of
my
old
life
before
you
were
born
you
shall
hear
everything
in
a
little
while
but
i
can
not
enter
into
it
all
at
this
moment
it
is
full
of
complications
and
secrets
that
belong
to
other
people
pippo
you
must
promise
me
to
wait
patiently
and
to
believe
to
believe
always
the
best
you
can
of
your
mother
the
boy
laughed
as
he
raised
her
up
still
holding
her
with
his
arm
believe
the
best
i
can
well
i
do
think
that
will
be
a
great
effort
mother
only
to
think
that
you
ca
trust
me
as
you
always
have
done
makes
me
wretched
we
been
such
friends
have
we
mamma
i
always
told
you
everything
or
at
least
everything
except
just
the
nonsense
at
school
and
you
told
me
everything
and
if
we
are
going
to
be
different
now
you
told
me
everything
the
boy
was
as
sure
of
it
as
that
he
was
born
she
had
to
hold
by
him
to
support
herself
and
it
cost
her
a
strong
effort
to
restrain
the
shiver
that
ran
through
her
we
are
not
going
to
be
different
she
said
as
soon
as
we
leave
london
or
before
you
shall
know
everything
about
this
business
of
mine
pippo
will
that
satisfy
you
in
the
meantime
it
is
not
pleasant
business
dear
and
you
must
bear
with
me
if
i
am
abstracted
sometimes
and
occupied
and
cross
but
mother
said
philip
bending
over
her
with
that
young
celestial
foolish
look
of
gravity
and
good
advice
with
which
a
neophyte
will
sometimes
address
the
and
pilgrim
you
think
it
would
be
easier
if
it
was
all
open
between
us
and
i
took
my
share
if
it
is
other
people
secrets
i
would
not
betray
them
you
know
that
unfortunately
elinor
here
murmured
scarcely
knowing
what
words
came
from
her
lips
that
is
what
john
says
john
said
the
boy
furious
with
the
quick
rage
of
injured
tenderness
and
pride
uncle
john
and
you
tell
him
more
him
an
outsider
than
you
tell
me
he
let
her
go
then
which
was
a
great
relief
to
elinor
for
she
could
command
herself
better
when
he
was
a
little
farther
off
and
could
not
feel
the
thrill
that
was
in
her
and
the
thumping
of
her
heart
you
must
remember
pippo
she
said
what
i
have
told
you
that
my
present
very
disagreeable
very
painful
business
is
about
things
that
happened
before
you
were
born
which
john
knew
everything
about
he
was
my
adviser
then
as
far
as
i
would
take
any
advice
which
i
am
afraid
never
was
much
pippo
she
said
never
alas
all
my
life
granny
will
tell
you
that
but
john
always
the
kindest
friend
and
the
best
brother
in
the
world
did
everything
he
could
and
it
would
have
been
better
for
us
all
if
i
had
taken
his
advice
instead
of
always
i
fear
always
my
own
way
strangely
enough
this
cheered
pippo
and
swept
the
cloud
from
his
face
i
glad
you
did
take
anybody
advice
mother
i
should
have
liked
it
i
more
faith
in
you
than
anybody
well
then
now
about
this
man
what
man
in
the
world
i
really
mean
in
the
world
in
what
is
called
society
for
that
is
the
kind
of
people
they
were
could
have
such
a
curiosity
about
me
she
had
resumed
her
seat
and
her
face
was
turned
away
from
him
also
the
exquisite
tone
of
complacency
and
innocent
with
which
philip
expressed
this
wonder
helped
her
a
little
to
surmount
the
situation
elinor
could
have
laughed
had
her
heart
been
only
a
trifle
less
burdened
she
said
are
you
sure
it
was
at
you
uncle
john
said
something
about
ladies
behind
us
but
i
am
sure
it
was
no
ladies
behind
it
might
of
course
the
boy
added
cautiously
have
been
you
know
i
suppose
uncle
john
a
personage
is
he
but
after
all
you
know
hang
it
mother
it
is
easy
to
believe
that
a
fellow
like
that
would
stare
so
at
uncle
john
poor
john
it
is
true
there
is
not
much
novelty
about
him
said
elinor
with
a
tremble
in
her
voice
which
if
it
was
half
agitation
was
yet
a
little
laughter
too
for
there
are
scarcely
any
circumstances
however
painful
in
which
those
who
are
that
way
moved
by
nature
are
quite
able
to
quench
the
unconquerable
laugh
she
added
with
a
falter
in
which
there
was
no
laughter
and
what
was
the
fellow
like
all
that
i
could
see
was
that
he
was
a
tall
man
i
saw
his
large
and
his
black
evening
clothes
and
something
like
grey
hair
above
those
two
big
black
goggles
grey
hair
elinor
said
with
a
low
suppressed
cry
he
never
took
them
away
from
his
eyes
for
a
moment
so
of
course
i
could
not
see
his
face
or
anything
much
except
that
he
was
more
than
common
tall
like
myself
pippo
said
with
a
little
air
of
pleased
vanity
in
the
comparison
like
himself
she
did
not
make
any
remark
it
is
very
doubtful
whether
she
could
have
done
so
there
came
before
her
so
many
visions
of
the
past
and
such
a
vague
confused
bewildering
future
of
which
she
could
form
no
definite
idea
what
it
would
be
was
it
with
a
pang
that
she
foresaw
that
drawing
towards
another
influence
that
mingled
instinct
curiosity
perhaps
admiration
and
wonder
which
already
seemed
to
move
her
boy
unconscious
mind
elinor
did
not
even
know
whether
that
would
hurt
her
at
all
even
now
there
seemed
a
curious
pungent
sense
of
in
the
pain
like
himself
so
he
was
and
if
it
should
be
that
it
was
his
father
who
for
hours
had
stood
there
not
taking
his
eyes
off
the
boy
for
hours
her
imagination
said
though
pippo
had
not
said
so
his
father
who
had
known
where
she
was
and
never
disturbed
her
never
interfered
with
her
the
man
who
had
summoned
her
to
perform
her
martyrdom
for
him
never
doubting
phil
with
grey
hair
to
say
what
mingled
feelings
swept
through
elinor
mind
with
all
these
elements
in
them
is
beyond
my
power
she
saw
him
with
his
face
concealed
standing
up
unconscious
of
the
crowded
place
and
of
the
mimic
life
on
the
stage
his
eyes
fixed
upon
his
son
whom
he
had
never
seen
before
where
was
there
any
drama
in
which
there
was
a
scene
like
this
his
son
his
only
child
the
heir
unconsciously
even
to
herself
that
fact
had
some
influence
no
doubt
on
elinor
thoughts
and
it
would
be
impossible
to
say
how
much
influence
had
that
unexpected
subduing
touch
of
the
grey
hair
and
the
strange
change
in
the
scene
altogether
the
foolish
noisy
fast
woman
with
her
of
men
and
dogs
about
her
turned
into
the
old
lady
of
pippo
careless
remark
with
her
daughter
beside
her
far
more
important
than
she
and
the
tall
figure
in
the
front
of
the
box
with
grey
hair
young
philip
had
not
the
faintest
light
or
guidance
in
the
discovery
of
his
mother
thoughts
he
was
much
more
easy
and
comfortable
now
that
there
had
been
an
explanation
between
them
though
it
was
one
of
those
explanations
which
explained
nothing
he
even
forgave
uncle
john
for
knowing
more
than
he
did
moved
thereto
by
the
consolatory
thought
that
john
advice
had
never
been
taken
and
that
his
mother
had
always
followed
her
own
way
this
was
an
incalculable
comfort
to
pippo
mind
and
gave
him
composure
to
wait
calmly
for
the
clearing
up
of
the
mystery
and
the
restoration
of
that
perfect
confidence
between
his
mother
and
himself
which
he
was
so
firmly
convinced
had
existed
all
his
life
he
was
a
great
deal
happier
after
and
gave
her
an
excellent
account
of
the
play
which
he
had
managed
to
see
quite
satisfactorily
notwithstanding
the
other
little
play
of
our
own
which
ran
through
everything
at
philip
age
one
can
see
two
things
at
once
well
enough
i
knew
a
boy
who
at
one
and
the
same
moment
got
the
benefit
of
his
own
story
book
which
he
read
lying
at
full
length
before
the
fire
half
buried
in
the
fur
of
a
great
rug
and
of
the
novel
which
was
being
read
out
over
his
head
for
the
benefit
of
the
other
members
of
the
family
or
at
least
he
strenuously
asserted
he
did
and
indeed
proved
himself
acquainted
with
both
philip
in
the
same
way
had
taken
in
everything
in
the
play
even
while
his
soul
was
intent
upon
the
in
the
box
he
had
not
missed
anything
of
either
he
gave
an
account
of
the
first
from
which
the
drama
might
have
been
written
down
had
fate
destroyed
it
and
had
noticed
the
of
the
heroine
and
the
eager
determination
not
to
be
second
to
her
in
anything
which
distinguished
the
first
gentleman
as
if
he
had
nothing
else
in
his
mind
while
all
the
time
he
had
been
under
the
fascination
of
the
two
black
eyeholes
upon
him
the
mysterious
gaze
as
of
a
ghost
from
eyes
which
he
never
saw
this
occupied
some
part
of
the
forenoon
and
philip
was
happy
but
when
he
had
completed
his
tale
and
began
to
feel
the
necessity
of
going
out
and
remembered
that
he
had
nowhere
to
go
and
nothing
to
do
the
prospect
was
not
alluring
he
tried
very
hard
to
persuade
his
mother
to
go
out
with
him
but
this
was
a
risk
from
which
elinor
shrank
she
shrank
too
from
his
proposal
at
last
to
go
out
to
the
park
by
himself
to
the
row
i
know
the
people
except
those
who
are
in
every
week
and
i
shall
envy
the
fellows
riding
but
at
least
it
will
be
something
to
see
i
wish
you
would
not
go
to
the
row
pippo
why
mother
does
everybody
go
and
you
never
were
here
at
this
time
of
the
year
before
no
she
said
with
a
long
breath
of
despair
no
of
all
times
of
the
year
this
was
the
one
in
which
she
had
never
risked
him
in
london
and
oh
that
he
had
been
anywhere
in
the
world
except
london
now
philip
who
had
been
watching
her
countenance
with
great
interest
here
patted
her
on
the
shoulder
with
condescending
almost
paternal
kindness
do
you
be
frightened
mother
i
not
get
into
any
mischief
i
neither
be
rode
over
nor
robbed
nor
run
away
take
as
great
care
of
myself
as
if
you
had
been
there
i
not
afraid
that
you
will
be
ridden
over
or
robbed
she
said
forcing
a
smile
but
there
is
one
thing
pippo
do
talk
to
anybody
whom
you
do
know
do
let
yourself
be
drawn
into
if
you
should
meet
for
instance
that
lady
who
was
in
the
theatre
last
night
yes
mother
do
let
her
make
acquaintance
with
you
do
speak
to
her
nor
the
girl
nor
any
one
that
may
be
with
her
at
the
risk
even
of
being
uncivil
why
mother
he
said
elevating
his
eyebrows
how
could
i
be
uncivil
to
a
lady
because
i
tell
you
she
cried
because
you
must
because
i
shall
sit
here
in
terror
counting
every
moment
till
you
come
back
if
you
promise
me
this
he
looked
at
her
with
the
most
wondering
countenance
half
disapproving
half
pitying
was
she
going
mad
what
was
happening
to
her
was
she
after
all
though
his
mother
no
better
than
the
jealous
foolish
women
in
books
who
endeavoured
at
all
costs
to
separate
their
children
from
every
influence
but
their
own
how
could
pippo
think
such
things
of
his
mother
and
yet
what
else
could
he
think
i
had
better
he
said
if
that
is
how
you
feel
mother
not
go
to
the
row
at
all
much
better
much
better
she
cried
i
tell
you
what
we
do
pippo
you
have
never
been
to
see
the
tower
she
had
run
over
all
the
most
and
unlikely
places
in
her
mind
and
this
occurred
to
her
as
the
most
impossible
of
all
to
attract
any
visitor
of
whom
she
could
be
afraid
i
have
changed
my
mind
she
added
well
have
a
hansom
and
i
will
go
with
you
to
see
the
tower
so
long
as
you
go
with
me
said
pippo
i
do
care
where
i
go
and
they
set
out
almost
joyfully
as
in
their
old
happy
expeditions
of
old
for
that
long
drive
through
london
in
the
hansom
and
yet
the
boy
was
only
lulled
for
the
moment
and
in
his
heart
was
more
and
more
perplexed
what
his
mother
could
mean
chapter
xliii
fortune
was
favourable
to
elinor
that
day
at
the
tower
where
she
duly
went
over
everything
that
was
to
be
seen
with
pippo
conscious
all
the
time
of
his
keen
observance
of
her
through
all
that
he
was
doing
and
even
through
his
interest
in
what
he
saw
and
feeling
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
that
there
was
between
her
boy
and
her
something
that
he
felt
something
that
was
not
explained
by
anything
she
had
said
and
that
awaited
the
dreadful
moment
when
everything
would
have
to
be
told
at
the
tower
as
i
say
they
met
some
friends
from
the
north
the
rector
of
the
parish
who
had
come
up
with
his
son
to
see
town
and
was
naturally
taking
his
boy
as
elinor
took
hers
to
see
all
that
was
not
town
in
the
usual
sense
of
the
word
they
were
going
to
woolwich
and
greenwich
next
day
and
with
a
pang
of
mingled
trouble
and
relief
in
her
mind
elinor
contrived
to
engage
pippo
to
accompany
them
on
the
second
day
i
think
they
were
to
go
to
katherine
docks
or
the
isle
of
dogs
or
some
other
equally
important
and
interesting
sight
far
better
no
doubt
for
the
two
youths
than
to
frequent
such
places
as
the
row
and
gaze
at
the
stream
of
gaiety
and
luxury
which
they
could
not
join
pippo
in
ordinary
circumstances
would
have
been
delighted
to
see
woolwich
and
the
docks
but
it
was
so
evident
to
him
that
his
mother
was
anxiously
desirous
to
dispose
of
him
so
that
his
satisfaction
was
much
lessened
the
boy
however
was
magnanimous
enough
to
consent
without
any
appearance
of
reluctance
in
the
many
thoughts
which
filled
his
mind
philip
showed
his
fine
nature
by
having
already
come
to
consent
to
the
possibility
that
his
mother
might
have
business
of
her
own
into
which
he
had
no
right
to
enter
unless
at
her
own
time
and
with
her
full
consent
it
cost
him
an
effort
i
allow
to
come
to
that
but
yet
he
did
so
and
resolved
a
little
pride
helping
him
to
inquire
no
more
and
if
possible
to
wonder
or
be
offended
no
more
but
to
wait
the
time
she
had
promised
when
the
old
rule
of
perfect
confidence
should
be
between
them
the
old
rule
if
pippo
had
but
known
nothing
yet
had
given
elinor
such
a
sense
of
guilt
as
his
conviction
that
she
had
told
him
everything
that
there
had
been
no
secrets
between
them
during
all
the
happy
life
that
was
past
how
entirely
relieved
elinor
was
when
he
started
to
join
his
friends
next
morning
it
would
be
impossible
to
put
into
words
she
watched
all
his
lingering
movements
before
he
went
with
eyes
in
which
she
tried
to
quench
the
impatience
and
look
only
with
the
fond
admiration
and
interest
she
felt
upon
all
his
little
preparations
his
dawning
sense
of
what
was
becoming
in
apparel
the
flower
in
his
coat
the
carefully
rolled
umbrella
the
hat
brushed
to
the
most
exquisite
smoothness
the
handkerchief
just
peeping
from
his
it
is
always
a
revelation
to
a
woman
to
find
that
these
details
occupy
as
much
of
a
young
man
attention
as
her
own
toilette
occupies
hers
and
that
he
is
as
tremulously
alive
to
what
is
worn
in
many
small
particulars
that
never
catch
her
eye
as
she
is
to
details
which
entirely
escape
him
she
smiles
at
him
as
he
does
at
her
each
in
that
conscious
superiority
to
the
other
which
is
on
the
whole
an
indulgent
sentiment
underneath
all
her
anxiety
to
see
him
go
to
get
rid
of
him
was
that
the
dreadful
truth
in
this
terrible
crisis
of
her
affairs
she
felt
the
amusement
of
the
boy
little
coquetries
and
the
mother
admiration
of
his
fresh
looks
his
youthful
brightness
his
air
of
distinction
how
different
from
the
rector
boy
who
was
a
nice
fellow
enough
and
a
credit
to
his
rectory
and
whose
mother
i
do
not
doubt
felt
in
his
ruddy
good
looks
something
much
superior
in
robustness
and
strength
and
manhood
to
the
and
golden
youth
of
the
ladies
at
lakeside
it
even
flitted
across
elinor
mind
to
give
him
within
herself
the
title
that
was
to
be
his
everybody
said
lord
lomond
and
then
she
asked
herself
indignantly
what
honour
it
could
add
to
her
spotless
boy
to
have
such
a
vain
distinction
a
name
that
had
been
soiled
by
so
much
ignoble
use
elinor
had
prided
herself
all
her
life
on
an
indifference
to
almost
a
contempt
for
the
distinctions
of
rank
and
that
it
should
occur
to
her
to
think
of
that
title
as
an
embellishment
to
pippo
nay
to
think
furtively
without
her
own
knowledge
so
to
speak
that
pippo
looked
every
inch
a
lord
and
heir
to
a
peerage
was
an
involuntary
weakness
almost
incredible
she
blushed
for
herself
as
she
realised
it
a
peerage
which
had
meant
so
little
that
was
excellent
a
name
connected
with
so
many
undesirable
precedents
still
i
suppose
when
it
is
his
own
even
the
veriest
democrat
is
conscious
at
least
of
the
picturesqueness
the
superiority
as
a
mode
of
distinguishing
one
man
from
another
of
anything
that
can
in
the
remotest
sense
be
called
a
historical
name
when
pippo
was
out
of
sight
elinor
turned
from
the
window
with
a
sigh
and
came
back
to
the
dark
chamber
of
her
own
life
full
at
this
moment
of
all
the
gathered
blackness
of
the
past
and
of
the
future
she
put
her
hands
over
her
eyes
and
sank
down
upon
a
seat
as
if
to
shut
out
from
herself
all
that
was
before
her
but
shut
it
out
as
she
might
there
it
was
the
horrible
court
with
the
the
rows
of
faces
bent
upon
her
the
silence
through
which
her
own
voice
must
rise
alone
saying
what
what
was
it
she
was
called
there
to
say
oh
how
little
they
knew
who
suggested
that
her
mother
should
have
been
called
instead
of
her
with
all
her
minute
calculations
and
exact
memory
who
even
now
when
all
was
over
would
probably
convict
elinor
of
a
mistake
even
at
that
penalty
what
would
not
she
give
to
have
it
over
the
thing
said
the
event
done
with
whatever
it
might
bring
after
it
and
it
could
now
be
only
a
very
short
time
till
the
moment
of
the
ordeal
would
come
when
she
should
stand
up
in
the
face
of
her
country
before
the
solemn
judge
on
his
bench
before
all
the
gaping
wondering
people
before
oh
thought
most
dreadful
of
all
which
we
would
not
could
not
contemplate
before
one
who
knew
everything
and
say
she
picked
herself
up
trembling
as
it
were
and
uncovered
her
eyes
and
protested
to
herself
that
she
would
say
nothing
that
was
not
true
nothing
that
was
not
true
she
would
tell
her
story
so
well
remembered
so
often
conned
that
story
that
had
been
put
into
her
lips
twenty
years
ago
which
she
had
repeated
then
confused
not
knowing
how
it
was
that
what
was
a
simple
fact
should
nevertheless
not
be
true
alas
she
knew
that
very
well
now
and
yet
would
have
to
repeat
it
before
god
and
the
world
but
thinking
would
make
it
no
better
thinking
could
only
make
it
worse
she
sprang
up
again
and
began
to
occupy
herself
with
something
she
had
to
do
the
less
it
was
thought
over
the
better
for
now
the
trial
had
begun
and
her
ordeal
would
soon
be
done
too
if
only
the
boy
could
be
occupied
kept
away
if
only
she
could
be
left
alone
to
do
what
she
had
to
do
that
he
should
be
there
was
the
last
aggravation
of
which
her
fate
was
capable
there
in
idleness
reading
the
papers
in
the
morning
which
was
a
thing
she
had
so
lately
calculated
a
boy
at
school
was
unlikely
to
do
and
what
so
likely
as
that
his
eye
would
be
caught
by
his
own
name
in
the
report
of
the
trial
which
would
be
an
exciting
trial
and
fully
reported
a
trial
which
interested
society
the
boy
would
see
his
own
name
she
could
almost
hear
him
cry
out
looking
up
from
his
breakfast
hallo
mother
here
something
about
a
philip
compton
and
all
the
questions
that
would
follow
is
he
the
same
comptons
that
we
are
what
comptons
do
we
belong
to
you
never
told
me
anything
about
my
family
is
this
man
any
relation
i
wonder
both
surname
and
christian
name
the
same
it
strange
if
there
is
no
connection
she
could
almost
hear
the
words
he
would
say
all
that
and
more
and
what
should
she
reply
i
have
only
one
thing
to
say
elinor
said
john
to
whom
in
her
desperation
she
turned
again
as
she
always
did
disturbing
him
poor
man
in
his
chambers
as
he
was
collecting
his
notes
and
his
thoughts
in
the
afternoon
after
his
work
was
over
it
is
the
same
as
i
have
always
said
even
now
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
to
the
boy
tell
him
everything
better
that
he
should
hear
it
from
your
own
lips
than
that
it
should
burst
upon
him
as
a
discovery
he
has
but
to
meet
lady
mariamne
in
the
park
the
most
likely
thing
in
the
world
no
john
cried
elinor
no
the
marshalls
are
here
our
rector
from
lakeside
and
he
is
taking
his
boy
to
see
all
the
sights
i
have
got
pippo
to
go
with
them
they
are
going
to
woolwich
and
afterwards
to
quite
a
long
list
of
things
oh
entirely
out
of
everybody
way
her
little
look
of
uneasy
triumph
and
satisfaction
made
john
smile
she
was
not
half
so
sure
as
she
tried
to
look
but
all
the
same
had
a
little
pride
a
little
pleasure
in
her
own
management
and
in
the
happy
chance
of
the
marshalls
being
in
london
which
was
a
thing
that
could
not
have
been
planned
an
intervention
of
providence
he
could
not
refuse
to
smile
partly
with
her
partly
at
her
simplicity
but
all
the
same
he
shook
his
head
the
only
way
in
which
there
is
any
safety
the
only
chance
of
preserving
him
from
a
shock
a
painful
shock
elinor
that
may
upset
him
for
life
how
do
you
mean
upset
him
for
life
by
showing
him
that
his
mother
whom
he
believes
in
like
heaven
has
deceived
him
since
ever
he
was
born
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
burst
into
a
sobbing
cry
oh
john
you
do
know
how
true
that
is
he
said
to
me
only
yesterday
have
always
told
me
everything
mother
there
has
never
been
any
secret
between
us
oh
john
john
only
think
of
having
that
said
to
me
and
knowing
what
i
know
well
elinor
believe
me
my
dear
there
is
but
one
thing
to
do
the
boy
is
a
good
boy
full
of
love
and
kindness
oh
is
he
john
the
best
boy
the
dearest
and
adores
his
mother
as
a
boy
should
john
got
up
from
his
chair
and
walked
about
the
room
for
a
little
and
then
he
came
behind
her
and
put
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
tell
him
elinor
my
dear
nelly
as
if
i
had
never
said
a
word
on
the
subject
before
i
beseech
you
tell
him
trust
him
fully
even
now
at
the
eleventh
hour
she
raised
her
head
with
a
quivering
wistful
smile
the
moment
the
trial
is
over
the
moment
it
is
over
i
give
you
my
word
john
do
not
wait
till
it
is
over
do
it
now
when
he
comes
home
she
began
to
tremble
so
that
john
tatham
was
alarmed
and
kept
looking
at
him
with
an
imploring
look
her
lips
quivering
and
every
line
in
her
countenance
oh
not
spare
me
after
the
trial
after
my
part
of
it
at
least
after
after
oh
give
me
till
to
think
of
it
my
dear
elinor
i
count
for
nothing
in
it
i
am
not
your
judge
i
am
your
partisan
you
know
whatever
you
do
but
i
am
sure
it
will
be
the
better
done
and
even
the
easier
done
the
sooner
you
do
it
i
will
i
will
at
the
very
latest
the
day
after
i
have
done
my
part
at
the
trial
is
not
that
enough
to
think
of
at
one
time
for
a
poor
woman
who
has
never
stood
up
before
the
public
in
all
her
life
never
had
a
question
put
to
her
oh
john
oh
john
elinor
elinor
you
are
too
sensible
a
woman
to
make
a
fuss
about
a
simple
duty
like
this
there
speaks
the
man
who
has
stood
before
the
world
all
his
life
and
is
not
afraid
of
any
public
she
said
with
a
tremulous
laugh
but
she
had
won
her
moment
delay
and
thus
was
victorious
after
a
fashion
as
it
was
her
habit
to
be
i
do
not
know
that
young
philip
much
amused
himself
at
woolwich
that
day
he
did
and
he
did
not
he
could
not
help
being
interested
in
all
he
saw
and
he
liked
the
marshalls
well
enough
and
in
ordinary
circumstances
would
have
entered
very
heartily
into
any
but
he
kept
thinking
all
the
time
what
his
mother
was
doing
and
wondering
over
the
mysterious
business
which
was
to
be
explained
to
him
sooner
or
later
and
which
he
had
so
magnanimously
promised
to
wait
for
the
revelation
of
and
entertain
no
suspicions
about
in
the
meantime
the
worst
of
such
magnanimity
is
that
it
is
subject
to
dreadful
failings
of
the
heart
in
its
time
of
waiting
never
giving
in
indeed
but
yet
feeling
the
pressure
whenever
there
is
a
moment
to
think
this
matter
mixed
itself
up
so
with
all
philip
saw
that
he
never
in
after
life
saw
a
great
cannon
or
a
pyramid
of
balls
which
is
not
to
be
sure
an
sight
without
a
vague
sensation
of
trouble
as
of
something
lying
behind
which
was
concealed
from
him
and
which
he
would
scarcely
endure
to
have
concealed
when
he
left
his
friends
in
the
evening
however
it
was
with
another
engagement
for
and
several
after
and
great
jubilation
on
the
part
of
both
father
and
son
as
to
their
good
luck
in
meeting
and
having
his
companionship
in
their
pleasures
and
in
fact
these
pleasures
were
carried
on
for
several
days
always
with
the
faint
bitter
in
them
to
philip
of
that
consciousness
that
his
mother
was
pleased
to
be
rid
of
him
glad
to
see
his
back
turned
the
most
novel
extraordinary
sensation
to
the
boy
and
it
must
also
be
confessed
that
he
kept
a
very
keen
eye
on
all
the
passing
carriages
always
hoping
to
see
that
one
in
which
the
witch
as
he
called
her
and
the
girl
with
the
keen
eyes
were
for
he
had
not
picked
up
the
name
of
lady
mariamne
keen
as
his
young
ears
were
and
though
john
had
mentioned
it
in
his
presence
partly
perhaps
because
it
was
so
very
unlikely
a
name
as
for
the
man
with
the
he
had
not
seen
his
face
at
all
and
therefore
could
not
hope
to
recognise
him
and
yet
he
felt
a
little
thrill
run
through
him
when
any
tall
man
with
grey
hair
passed
in
the
street
he
almost
thought
he
could
have
known
the
tall
slim
figure
with
a
certain
swaying
movement
in
it
which
was
not
like
anybody
else
i
need
not
say
however
that
even
had
these
indications
been
stronger
woolwich
and
the
isle
of
dogs
were
unlikely
places
in
which
to
meet
lady
mariamne
or
any
gentleman
likely
to
be
in
attendance
on
her
in
whitechapel
indeed
had
he
but
known
he
might
have
met
miss
dolly
but
then
in
whitechapel
there
were
no
sights
which
virtuous
youth
is
led
to
see
and
philip
man
with
the
was
during
these
days
using
that
aid
to
vision
in
a
very
different
place
and
had
neither
leisure
nor
inclination
to
move
vaguely
about
the
world
for
three
days
this
went
on
successfully
enough
young
philip
compton
and
ralph
marshall
saw
enough
to
last
them
all
the
rest
of
their
lives
and
there
was
no
limit
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
good
country
clergyman
who
felt
that
he
never
could
have
succeeded
so
completely
in
improving
his
son
mind
instead
of
delivering
him
over
to
the
frivolous
amusements
of
town
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
companionship
of
philip
who
made
ralph
feel
that
it
was
all
right
and
that
he
was
not
being
victimised
for
nothing
but
on
the
fourth
day
a
hitch
occurred
john
tatham
had
been
made
to
give
all
sorts
of
orders
and
admissions
for
the
party
to
see
every
nook
and
corner
of
the
temple
much
to
elinor
alarm
who
felt
that
place
was
too
near
to
be
safe
but
she
was
herself
in
circumstances
too
urgent
to
permit
her
dwelling
upon
it
she
had
left
the
house
on
that
particular
morning
long
before
philip
was
ready
and
every
anxiety
was
dulled
in
her
mind
for
the
moment
by
the
overwhelming
sense
of
the
crisis
arrived
she
went
to
his
room
before
he
had
left
it
and
gave
him
a
kiss
and
told
him
that
she
might
be
detained
for
a
long
time
that
she
did
know
exactly
at
what
hour
she
should
return
she
was
very
pale
paler
than
he
had
ever
seen
her
and
her
manner
had
a
suppressed
agitation
in
it
which
startled
philip
but
she
managed
to
smile
as
she
assured
him
she
was
quite
well
and
that
there
was
nothing
troubling
her
nothing
nothing
that
has
to
do
with
us
a
little
disturbed
for
a
friend
but
that
will
be
all
over
she
said
i
hope
philip
made
a
leisurely
breakfast
after
she
was
gone
and
it
happened
to
him
that
morning
for
the
first
time
as
he
was
alone
to
make
a
study
of
the
papers
and
the
consequence
was
that
he
said
to
himself
really
those
words
which
his
mother
in
imagination
had
so
often
heard
him
say
hallo
philip
compton
my
name
i
wonder
if
he
is
any
relation
i
wonder
if
we
have
anything
to
do
with
those
serf
comptons
then
he
reflected
but
vaguely
that
he
did
not
know
to
what
comptons
he
belonged
nor
even
what
county
he
came
from
to
tell
the
truth
and
then
it
was
time
to
hurry
over
his
breakfast
to
swallow
his
cup
of
tea
to
snatch
up
his
hat
and
gloves
and
to
rush
off
to
meet
his
friends
but
on
that
day
philip
was
unlucky
when
he
got
to
the
place
of
meeting
he
found
nothing
but
a
telegram
from
ralph
announcing
that
his
father
was
so
knocked
up
with
his
previous
exertions
that
they
were
obliged
to
take
a
quiet
day
and
thus
philip
was
left
in
the
temple
of
all
places
in
the
world
on
the
day
when
his
mother
was
to
appear
in
the
close
by
on
the
day
of
all
others
when
if
she
could
have
sent
him
for
hours
to
the
end
of
the
earth
she
would
have
done
so
on
the
day
when
so
terrible
was
the
stress
and
strain
upon
herself
that
for
once
in
the
world
even
pippo
had
gone
as
completely
out
of
her
mind
as
if
he
had
not
been
the
boy
looked
about
him
for
awhile
and
reflected
what
to
do
and
then
he
started
out
into
the
strand
conscientiously
waiting
for
the
marshalls
before
he
should
visit
the
temple
and
all
its
historical
ways
and
then
he
was
amused
and
excited
by
seeing
a
barrister
or
two
in
wig
and
gown
pass
by
and
then
he
thought
of
the
trial
in
the
newspapers
in
which
somebody
who
like
himself
was
called
philip
compton
was
involved
philip
was
still
lingering
wondering
if
he
could
get
into
the
court
a
little
shy
of
trying
but
gradually
growing
eager
thinking
at
least
that
he
would
try
and
get
a
sight
of
the
wonderful
grand
building
still
so
new
when
he
suddenly
saw
simmons
his
uncle
john
clerk
passing
through
the
quadrangle
of
the
here
was
his
chance
he
rushed
forward
and
caught
the
clerk
by
the
arm
who
was
in
a
great
hurry
as
everybody
seemed
to
be
oh
simmons
can
you
get
me
into
that
brown
trial
cried
philip
brown
simmons
said
tatham
is
not
on
in
that
oh
never
mind
about
tatham
said
the
boy
ca
you
get
me
in
i
have
never
seen
a
trial
and
i
take
an
interest
in
that
i
advise
you
said
simmons
to
wait
for
one
that
your
uncle
in
ca
you
get
me
in
said
philip
impatiently
and
this
touched
the
pride
of
simmons
who
had
many
friends
if
not
in
high
places
yet
in
low
chapter
xliv
philip
had
never
been
in
a
court
of
law
before
i
am
almost
as
ignorant
as
he
was
yet
i
can
not
imagine
anything
more
deeply
interesting
than
to
find
one
self
suddenly
one
of
a
crowded
assembly
trying
more
or
less
for
is
not
the
public
but
a
larger
jury
sometimes
contradicting
the
verdict
of
the
other
and
when
it
does
so
almost
invariably
winning
the
cause
a
following
out
the
traces
of
his
crime
or
his
innocence
looking
on
while
a
human
drama
is
unrolled
often
far
more
interesting
than
any
dramatic
representation
of
life
he
was
confused
for
the
moment
by
the
crowd
by
the
new
and
unusual
spectacle
by
the
bewilderment
of
seeing
for
the
first
time
what
he
had
so
often
heard
of
the
judge
on
the
bench
the
wigged
barristers
below
the
one
who
was
speaking
so
different
from
any
other
public
speaker
philip
had
ever
heard
addressing
not
the
assembly
but
the
smaller
circle
round
him
interrupted
by
other
voices
the
accused
in
his
place
and
the
witness
standing
there
more
distinctly
at
the
bar
than
the
culprit
was
bearing
his
testimony
before
earth
and
heaven
with
the
fate
of
another
hanging
on
his
words
the
boy
was
so
full
of
the
novel
sight
which
yet
he
had
heard
of
so
often
that
he
could
identify
every
part
of
it
and
soon
perceived
the
scope
of
what
was
going
on
that
he
did
not
at
first
listen
so
full
was
he
of
the
interest
of
what
he
saw
the
imperturbable
judge
grave
letting
no
emotion
appear
on
his
face
the
jury
just
the
reverse
showing
how
this
and
that
piece
of
evidence
affected
them
the
barristers
who
were
engaged
so
keenly
alive
to
everything
starting
up
now
and
then
when
the
witness
swerved
from
the
subject
when
the
opposition
proposed
a
leading
question
or
one
that
was
irrelevant
to
the
issue
the
others
who
were
not
in
it
as
simmons
said
so
indifferent
and
then
the
spectators
who
had
places
about
or
near
the
central
interest
philip
saw
with
a
sudden
leap
of
his
heart
the
ladies
of
the
theatre
and
park
the
witch
and
the
girl
with
the
keen
eyes
in
a
conspicuous
place
the
old
lady
as
he
called
her
full
of
movement
and
gesture
making
signs
to
others
near
her
keeping
up
an
interrupted
whispering
the
girl
at
her
side
as
impassive
as
the
judge
himself
and
then
pippo
roving
eye
caught
a
figure
seated
among
the
barristers
with
an
which
made
his
heart
jump
still
more
was
that
the
man
he
had
at
the
moment
philip
perceived
him
his
in
his
hand
a
tall
man
leaning
back
with
a
look
of
interest
very
conspicuous
among
the
wigged
heads
about
him
with
grey
hair
in
a
mass
on
his
forehead
as
if
it
had
grown
thin
and
had
been
coaxed
to
cover
some
denuded
place
and
a
face
which
it
seemed
to
philip
he
had
seen
before
a
face
worn
was
it
with
study
was
it
with
trouble
pippo
knew
of
no
other
ways
in
which
the
eyes
could
be
so
hollowed
out
and
the
lines
so
deeply
drawn
a
man
perhaps
hard
worn
with
life
and
labor
and
sorrow
a
strange
sympathy
sprang
up
in
the
boy
mind
he
was
sure
he
knew
the
face
it
was
a
face
full
of
records
though
young
philip
could
not
read
them
the
face
he
thought
of
a
man
who
had
had
much
to
bear
was
it
the
same
man
who
had
fixed
so
strange
a
gaze
upon
himself
at
the
theatre
and
what
interest
could
this
man
have
in
the
trial
that
was
going
on
the
accused
at
the
bar
was
certainly
not
of
a
kind
to
arouse
the
interest
which
sprang
into
being
at
sight
of
this
worn
and
noble
hero
he
had
the
air
of
a
comfortable
man
of
business
a
man
evidently
well
off
surprised
at
once
and
indignant
to
find
himself
there
sometimes
bursting
with
eagerness
to
explain
sometimes
leaning
back
with
an
air
of
affected
contempt
not
a
good
man
in
trouble
as
philip
would
have
liked
to
think
him
nor
a
criminal
fully
conscious
of
what
might
be
awaiting
him
but
a
man
of
the
first
respectability
indignant
and
incredulous
that
anything
should
be
brought
against
him
philip
felt
himself
able
to
take
no
interest
whatever
in
brown
it
was
not
till
he
had
gone
through
all
these
surprises
and
observations
that
he
began
to
note
what
was
being
said
philip
was
not
learned
in
the
procedure
of
the
law
nor
did
he
know
anything
about
the
case
but
it
became
vaguely
apparent
to
him
after
awhile
that
the
immediate
question
concerned
the
destruction
of
the
books
of
a
company
of
which
brown
was
the
manager
an
important
point
which
the
prosecution
had
some
difficulty
in
bringing
home
to
him
after
it
had
been
proved
that
the
books
had
been
destroyed
and
that
so
far
as
was
known
it
was
to
brown
interest
alone
to
destroy
them
the
evidence
as
to
what
had
been
seen
on
the
evening
on
which
this
took
place
suddenly
took
a
new
turn
and
seemed
to
introduce
a
new
actor
on
the
scene
some
one
had
been
seen
to
enter
the
office
in
the
twilight
who
could
not
be
identified
with
brown
whom
indeed
even
philip
with
his
boyish
interest
in
the
novelty
of
the
proceedings
vaguely
perceived
to
be
another
man
the
action
of
the
piece
so
to
speak
for
it
was
like
a
play
to
philip
changed
and
wavered
here
and
he
began
to
be
sensible
of
the
character
of
the
different
players
in
it
the
counsel
for
the
prosecution
was
a
and
eminent
barrister
one
of
the
most
noted
of
the
time
a
man
before
whom
witnesses
trembled
and
even
the
bench
itself
was
sometimes
known
to
quail
that
this
was
the
case
on
the
present
occasion
philip
vaguely
perceived
there
were
points
continually
arising
which
the
opposing
counsel
made
objections
to
appealing
to
the
judge
but
it
rarely
failed
that
the
stronger
side
which
was
that
of
the
prosecution
won
the
day
the
imperious
accuser
whose
resources
of
precedent
and
argument
seemed
boundless
carried
everything
with
a
high
hand
the
boy
of
course
was
not
aware
of
the
weakness
of
the
representative
of
the
majesty
of
the
law
nor
the
inferiority
in
force
and
skill
of
the
defence
but
he
gradually
came
to
a
practical
perception
of
how
the
matter
stood
philip
listened
with
growing
interest
sometimes
amused
sometimes
indignant
as
the
remorseless
prosecutor
ploughed
his
way
through
the
witnesses
whom
he
bullied
into
admissions
that
they
were
certain
of
nothing
and
that
in
the
dusk
of
that
evening
the
man
whom
they
had
sworn
at
the
time
to
be
quite
unlike
him
might
in
reality
have
been
brown
philip
got
greatly
interested
in
this
question
he
took
up
the
opposite
side
himself
with
much
heat
feeling
as
sure
as
if
he
had
been
there
that
it
was
not
brown
and
he
was
delighted
in
his
excitement
when
there
stood
up
one
man
who
would
not
be
bullied
a
man
who
had
the
air
of
a
respectable
clerk
of
the
lower
class
and
who
held
his
own
he
had
been
an
office
boy
the
son
apparently
of
the
housekeeper
in
charge
of
the
premises
referred
to
when
the
incident
occurred
and
the
gist
of
his
evidence
was
that
the
prisoner
at
the
bar
so
awful
a
personage
once
to
the
little
office
boy
so
curtly
discussed
now
as
brown
had
left
the
office
at
four
in
the
afternoon
of
the
of
september
and
had
not
appeared
again
a
different
gentleman
altogether
came
in
the
evening
a
much
taller
man
with
a
large
moustache
where
was
it
that
you
saw
this
man
slipping
in
at
the
side
door
of
the
office
as
if
he
did
want
to
be
seen
was
that
a
door
which
was
generally
open
or
used
by
the
public
never
sir
but
none
of
the
doors
were
used
at
that
time
of
night
and
how
then
could
any
one
get
admittance
there
only
those
that
had
private
keys
the
directors
had
their
private
keys
then
your
conclusion
was
that
it
was
a
director
and
that
he
had
a
right
to
be
there
i
knew
it
was
a
director
sir
because
i
knew
the
gentleman
the
witness
said
you
say
it
was
late
in
the
evening
of
the
of
september
was
it
daylight
at
the
time
oh
no
sir
nearly
dark
a
sort
of
a
half
light
did
the
person
you
saw
go
in
openly
or
make
any
attempt
at
concealment
he
had
a
light
coat
on
like
the
coats
gentlemen
wear
when
they
go
to
the
theatre
and
something
muffled
round
his
throat
and
his
hat
pulled
down
over
his
face
like
a
person
who
wished
to
conceal
himself
yes
sir
said
the
witness
and
how
then
if
he
was
muffled
about
the
throat
and
his
hat
pulled
over
his
face
in
the
half
light
late
in
the
evening
could
you
see
that
he
had
a
large
moustache
the
witness
stood
and
stared
with
his
mouth
open
and
made
no
reply
the
counsel
with
a
louder
voice
and
those
intonations
of
contemptuous
insinuation
which
are
calculated
to
make
a
man
feel
that
he
is
convicted
of
the
basest
perjury
and
is
being
held
up
to
the
reprobation
of
the
world
repeated
the
question
how
could
you
see
that
he
had
a
large
moustache
i
saw
it
said
the
witness
hotly
because
i
knew
the
gentleman
and
how
did
you
know
the
gentleman
you
thought
you
recognised
the
gentleman
and
therefore
though
you
could
not
possibly
perceive
it
you
saw
his
moustache
i
fear
that
is
not
an
answer
that
will
satisfy
the
jury
i
submit
said
the
counsel
for
the
defence
that
it
is
very
evident
what
the
witness
means
he
recognised
a
man
with
whose
appearance
he
was
perfectly
familiar
i
saw
him
said
the
witness
as
clear
as
i
see
you
sir
what
in
the
dark
late
on
a
september
night
with
a
coat
collar
up
to
his
ears
and
a
hat
pulled
down
over
his
face
you
see
my
learned
friend
in
broad
daylight
and
with
the
full
advantage
of
standing
opposite
to
him
and
studying
his
looks
at
your
leisure
you
might
as
well
say
because
you
know
the
gentleman
that
you
could
see
his
half
was
dark
and
abundant
under
his
wig
at
this
a
laugh
ran
through
the
court
at
which
philip
listening
was
furiously
indignant
as
it
interrupted
the
course
of
the
investigation
it
was
through
the
sound
of
this
laugh
that
he
heard
the
witness
demand
loudly
how
could
i
be
mistaken
when
i
saw
compton
every
day
compton
philip
heart
began
to
beat
like
the
hammers
of
a
was
this
then
the
real
issue
and
who
was
compton
he
could
not
have
told
how
it
was
that
he
somehow
identified
the
man
whom
the
witness
had
seen
or
had
not
seen
with
the
man
who
had
the
and
who
had
fixed
a
dreadful
blank
stare
upon
the
other
in
the
during
a
great
part
of
this
discussion
was
it
he
who
was
on
his
trial
and
not
brown
and
who
was
he
and
where
was
it
that
philip
had
known
and
grown
familiar
with
that
face
which
so
far
as
he
could
remember
he
had
never
seen
before
but
which
belonged
to
the
man
who
bore
his
own
name
when
the
counsel
for
the
prosecution
had
turned
the
unfortunate
witness
outside
in
and
proved
that
he
knew
nothing
and
had
seen
nobody
and
that
besides
he
was
a
man
totally
unworthy
of
credit
who
had
lied
from
his
cradle
and
whose
own
mother
and
friends
put
no
trust
in
him
the
court
adjourned
for
lunch
but
philip
forgot
that
he
required
any
lunch
his
mind
was
filled
with
echoes
of
that
name
he
began
to
feel
a
strange
certainty
that
it
was
the
same
man
who
had
fixed
him
with
the
same
gaze
in
the
theatre
who
was
compton
and
what
was
he
the
question
took
the
boy
breath
away
he
sat
through
the
interval
finding
a
place
where
he
could
see
better
through
the
kind
offices
of
the
usher
to
whom
simmons
had
commended
him
and
waiting
with
impatience
till
the
trial
should
be
resumed
nobody
remarked
the
boy
among
the
crowd
of
the
ordinary
public
many
of
whom
remained
as
he
did
to
see
it
out
philip
cared
nothing
about
brown
all
that
he
wanted
to
know
was
about
this
namesake
of
his
this
compton
this
other
man
who
was
not
brown
if
it
was
the
man
with
the
he
was
not
so
much
excited
as
his
young
namesake
for
he
went
to
luncheon
with
the
rest
while
the
boy
remained
counting
the
minutes
eager
to
begin
the
story
the
drama
again
the
impression
left
however
on
philip
impartial
mind
was
that
the
last
witness
though
driven
and
badgered
out
of
what
wits
he
had
by
the
examination
had
really
seen
a
man
whom
he
perfectly
knew
his
recognition
of
whom
was
not
really
affected
either
by
the
twilight
or
the
disguise
the
thrill
of
interest
which
he
felt
running
through
all
his
veins
as
the
court
filled
again
was
like
but
stronger
than
the
interest
with
which
he
had
ever
seen
the
curtain
rise
in
the
theatre
his
heart
beat
he
felt
as
if
in
some
sort
it
was
his
own
fate
that
was
going
to
be
decided
all
his
prepossessions
were
in
favour
of
that
other
accused
yet
not
openly
accused
person
who
was
not
brown
and
yet
he
felt
almost
as
sure
as
if
he
had
been
there
that
the
office
boy
of
twenty
years
ago
had
seen
that
man
stealing
in
at
the
side
door
young
philip
did
not
catch
the
name
of
the
next
witness
who
was
called
such
a
thing
will
happen
sometimes
even
with
the
quickest
ear
at
a
moment
when
every
whisper
is
important
if
he
had
heard
he
would
probably
have
thought
that
he
was
deceived
by
his
excitement
impossible
as
it
was
that
such
a
name
should
have
anything
to
do
with
this
or
any
other
trial
the
shock
therefore
was
unbroken
when
watching
with
all
the
absorbed
interest
of
a
spectator
at
the
most
exciting
play
the
boy
saw
a
lady
come
slowly
forward
into
the
philip
had
the
same
strange
sense
of
knowing
who
it
was
that
he
had
felt
the
previous
witness
to
have
in
respect
to
the
man
whom
he
could
not
see
but
yet
had
infallibly
recognised
but
he
said
to
himself
no
it
was
not
possible
no
it
was
not
possible
she
came
forward
slowly
put
up
the
veil
that
had
covered
her
face
and
grasped
the
bar
before
her
to
support
herself
and
then
the
boy
sprang
to
his
feet
in
the
terrible
shock
which
electrified
him
from
head
to
feet
his
movements
and
the
stifled
cry
he
uttered
made
a
little
commotion
in
the
crowd
and
called
forth
the
cry
of
silence
in
the
court
his
neighbours
around
him
hustled
him
back
into
his
place
where
he
sank
down
incapable
indeed
of
movement
knowing
that
he
could
not
go
and
pluck
her
from
that
place
could
not
rush
to
her
side
could
do
nothing
but
sit
there
and
gasp
and
gaze
at
his
mother
his
mother
in
such
a
place
in
such
a
case
with
which
surely
surely
she
could
have
nothing
to
do
elinor
compton
at
the
time
referred
to
elinor
dennistoun
of
windyhill
in
surrey
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
name
now
and
philip
had
time
enough
to
identify
everything
name
and
person
for
there
rose
a
vague
surging
of
contention
about
the
first
questions
put
to
her
which
were
not
evidence
according
to
the
counsel
on
the
other
side
which
he
felt
with
fury
was
done
on
purpose
to
prolong
the
agony
during
this
time
she
stood
immovable
holding
on
by
the
rail
before
her
her
eyes
fixed
upon
it
perfectly
pale
like
marble
and
as
still
among
all
the
moving
rustling
palpitating
crowd
and
the
sharp
volleys
of
the
voices
and
even
the
contradictory
opinions
elicited
from
the
harassed
judge
himself
to
look
at
that
figure
standing
there
which
scarcely
seemed
to
breathe
had
the
most
extraordinary
effect
for
a
time
philip
was
like
her
scarcely
breathing
holding
on
in
an
unconscious
sympathy
to
the
back
of
the
seat
before
him
his
eyes
wide
open
fixed
upon
her
but
as
his
nerves
began
to
accustom
themselves
to
that
extraordinary
inconceivable
sight
the
other
particulars
of
the
scene
came
out
of
the
mist
and
grew
apparent
to
him
in
a
lurid
light
that
did
not
seem
the
light
of
day
he
saw
the
eager
looks
at
her
of
the
ladies
in
the
privileged
places
the
whispers
that
were
exchanged
among
them
he
saw
underneath
the
almost
within
reach
of
her
john
tatham
with
an
anxious
look
on
his
face
and
then
he
saw
what
was
the
most
extraordinary
of
all
the
man
who
had
been
the
centre
of
his
interest
till
now
the
man
whose
name
was
philip
compton
like
his
own
he
who
fixed
the
last
witness
with
the
stare
of
his
who
had
kept
it
in
perpetual
use
he
had
put
it
down
now
on
the
table
before
him
his
arms
were
folded
on
his
breast
and
his
head
bent
philip
thought
he
detected
now
and
then
a
furtive
look
under
his
brows
at
the
motionless
witness
awaiting
through
the
storm
of
words
the
moment
when
her
turn
would
come
but
though
he
had
leant
forward
all
the
time
following
every
point
of
the
proceedings
with
interest
he
now
drew
back
effaced
himself
retired
as
it
were
from
the
scene
what
was
there
between
these
two
was
there
any
link
between
them
what
was
the
drama
about
to
be
played
out
before
pippo
innocent
and
ignorant
eyes
at
last
the
storm
and
wrangling
seemed
to
come
to
an
end
and
there
came
out
low
but
clear
the
sound
of
her
voice
it
seemed
only
now
when
he
heard
his
mother
speak
that
he
was
certified
that
so
inconceivable
a
thing
as
that
she
should
be
here
was
a
matter
of
fact
his
mother
here
philip
fixed
his
whole
being
upon
her
eyes
thoughts
absorbed
attention
he
scarcely
seemed
to
breathe
except
through
her
could
she
see
him
he
wondered
through
all
that
crowd
but
then
he
perceived
that
she
saw
nothing
with
those
eyes
that
looked
steadily
in
front
of
her
not
turning
a
glance
either
to
the
right
or
left
for
some
time
philip
was
baffled
completely
by
the
questions
put
which
were
those
to
which
the
counsel
on
the
other
side
objected
as
not
evidence
and
which
seemed
even
to
the
boy
inexperienced
mind
to
be
mere
play
upon
the
subject
attempts
to
connect
her
in
some
way
with
the
question
as
to
brown
guilt
or
innocence
something
in
the
appearance
at
this
stage
of
a
lady
so
unlike
the
other
witnesses
seemed
to
exercise
a
certain
strange
effect
however
quickening
interest
and
when
the
examining
counsel
approached
the
question
of
the
date
which
had
already
been
shown
to
be
so
momentous
all
interruptions
were
silenced
and
the
court
in
general
like
philip
held
its
breath
there
were
many
there
expecting
what
are
called
in
the
newspapers
revelations
the
defence
was
taken
by
surprise
and
did
not
know
what
new
piece
of
evidence
was
about
to
be
produced
and
even
the
examining
counsel
was
for
such
a
man
subdued
a
little
by
the
other
complicating
threads
of
the
web
among
which
he
had
to
pick
his
way
you
recollect
he
said
in
his
most
soothing
tones
the
evening
of
the
september
she
bowed
her
head
in
reply
and
then
as
if
that
was
sparing
herself
too
much
added
a
low
yes
as
i
am
instructed
you
were
not
then
married
but
engaged
to
philip
compton
is
that
so
yes
one
of
the
directors
of
the
company
of
which
the
defendant
was
manager
i
believe
so
i
am
sorry
to
have
to
enter
upon
matters
so
private
but
there
was
some
question
i
believe
about
an
investment
to
be
made
of
a
portion
of
your
fortune
in
the
hands
of
this
company
yes
you
received
a
visit
from
compton
on
the
subject
on
the
day
i
have
mentioned
the
witness
made
a
slight
movement
and
pause
then
answered
as
before
but
more
firmly
yes
she
added
not
on
this
subject
in
a
lower
tone
you
can
recollect
more
or
less
exactly
the
time
of
his
arrival
yes
it
was
in
the
evening
after
dinner
in
the
darkening
before
the
lamps
were
lit
were
you
looking
for
him
on
that
night
no
it
was
an
unexpected
visit
he
was
going
to
ireland
and
paused
on
his
way
through
town
to
come
down
to
windyhill
you
have
particular
reasons
for
remembering
the
date
which
make
it
impossible
that
there
could
be
any
mistake
no
there
could
be
no
mistake
you
will
perhaps
inform
the
court
compton
why
your
memory
is
so
exact
on
this
point
once
more
she
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
then
replied
it
was
exactly
ten
days
before
my
marriage
i
think
that
will
do
compton
i
will
trouble
you
no
further
the
counsel
said
the
hubbub
which
sprang
up
upon
this
seemed
to
philip
for
the
moment
as
if
it
were
directed
against
his
mother
which
of
course
was
not
the
case
but
intended
to
express
the
indignant
surprise
of
the
defence
at
the
elaborate
examination
of
a
witness
who
had
nothing
to
say
on
the
main
subject
the
leader
on
the
other
side
however
though
taken
by
surprise
and
denouncing
the
trick
which
his
learned
brother
had
played
upon
the
court
by
producing
evidence
which
had
really
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter
announced
his
intention
to
put
a
further
question
or
two
to
compton
young
philip
in
the
crowd
started
again
from
his
seat
with
the
feeling
that
he
would
like
to
fly
at
that
man
throat
twenty
years
is
a
long
time
he
said
and
it
is
difficult
to
be
sure
of
any
circumstance
at
such
a
distance
perhaps
the
witness
will
kindly
inform
us
what
were
the
circumstances
which
fixed
this
no
doubt
one
of
many
visits
on
her
mind
elinor
turned
for
the
first
time
to
the
side
from
which
the
question
came
with
a
little
movement
of
that
impatience
which
was
habitual
to
her
which
three
persons
in
that
crowd
recognised
in
a
moment
as
characteristic
one
of
these
was
john
tatham
who
had
brought
her
to
the
court
and
kept
near
that
she
might
feel
that
she
was
not
alone
the
other
was
her
son
of
whose
presence
there
nobody
knew
the
third
sat
with
his
eyes
cast
down
and
his
arms
folded
on
his
breast
not
looking
at
her
yet
seeing
every
movement
she
made
it
was
a
very
simple
circumstance
she
said
with
the
added
spirit
of
that
impetuous
impulse
but
then
the
hasty
movement
failed
her
and
she
came
back
to
herself
and
to
a
consciousness
of
the
scene
in
which
she
stood
a
sort
of
tremulous
shiver
came
into
her
voice
she
paused
and
then
resumed
there
was
a
calendar
hanging
in
the
hall
it
caught
compton
eye
and
he
pointed
it
out
to
me
it
marked
the
he
said
ten
days
here
her
voice
stopped
altogether
she
could
say
no
more
and
there
was
an
answering
pause
throughout
the
whole
crowded
court
a
holding
of
the
general
breath
the
response
to
a
note
of
passion
seldom
struck
in
such
a
place
even
in
the
there
was
a
pause
till
when
what
was
the
other
date
referred
to
the
sixteenth
of
september
she
said
in
a
voice
that
was
scarcely
audible
to
the
crowd
she
added
still
more
low
so
that
the
judge
curved
his
hand
over
his
ear
to
hear
her
our
i
regret
to
enter
into
private
matters
compton
but
i
believe
it
is
not
a
secret
that
your
married
life
came
to
a
more
rapid
conclusion
than
could
have
been
augured
from
such
a
beginning
may
i
ask
what
your
reasons
were
for
but
here
the
other
counsel
sprang
to
his
feet
and
the
contention
arose
again
such
a
question
was
not
clearly
permissible
and
the
prosecution
was
perfectly
satisfied
with
the
evidence
it
narrowed
the
question
by
the
production
of
this
clear
and
unquestionable
testimony
the
gentleman
whom
it
had
been
attempted
to
involve
being
thus
placed
out
of
the
question
and
all
the
statements
of
the
previous
witness
about
the
moustache
which
he
could
not
see
set
aside
philip
it
may
be
supposed
paid
little
attention
to
this
further
discussion
his
eyes
and
thoughts
were
fixed
upon
his
mother
who
for
a
minute
or
two
stood
motionless
through
it
as
pale
as
ever
but
with
her
head
a
little
thrown
back
facing
though
not
looking
at
the
circling
lines
of
faces
had
she
seen
anything
she
must
have
seen
the
tall
boy
standing
up
as
pale
as
she
following
her
movements
with
an
unconscious
repetition
which
was
more
than
sympathy
never
taking
his
gaze
from
her
face
and
then
presently
her
place
was
empty
and
she
was
gone
philip
was
not
aware
how
the
discussion
of
the
lawyers
ended
but
only
that
in
a
moment
there
was
vacancy
where
his
mother
had
been
standing
and
his
gaze
seemed
thrown
back
to
him
by
the
blank
where
she
had
been
he
was
left
in
the
midst
of
the
crowd
which
after
that
one
keen
sensation
fell
back
upon
the
real
trial
with
interest
much
less
keen
chapter
xlv
philip
did
not
know
how
long
he
remained
almost
paralysed
in
the
court
dazed
in
his
mind
incapable
of
movement
he
was
in
the
centre
of
a
long
row
of
people
and
to
make
his
way
out
was
difficult
he
felt
that
the
noise
would
call
attention
to
him
and
that
he
might
be
somehow
identified
identified
as
what
he
did
not
know
his
head
was
not
clear
enough
to
give
any
reason
when
he
came
more
to
himself
and
his
eyes
regained
a
little
their
power
of
vision
it
seemed
to
him
that
everybody
had
stolen
away
there
was
the
judge
indeed
still
sitting
imperturbable
the
jury
restless
in
their
box
the
lawyers
going
on
with
their
eternal
quarrel
over
a
bewildered
witness
all
puppets
carrying
on
some
unintelligible
wearisome
automaton
process
contending
contending
for
ever
about
nothing
but
all
that
had
secured
philip
attention
was
gone
john
tatham
head
was
no
longer
visible
under
the
the
ladies
had
disappeared
from
their
elevated
seats
the
man
with
the
was
gone
they
were
all
gone
and
the
empty
husks
of
a
question
which
only
concerned
the
comfort
and
life
of
the
commonplace
culprit
in
the
dock
were
being
turned
over
and
over
like
chaff
by
the
wind
and
yet
it
was
some
time
before
poor
young
pippo
shy
of
attracting
attention
feeling
some
subtle
change
even
in
himself
which
he
did
not
understand
afraid
to
have
people
look
at
him
and
divine
him
knowing
more
of
him
perhaps
than
he
himself
knew
could
make
up
his
mind
to
move
he
might
have
remained
there
till
the
court
broke
up
but
for
the
movement
of
some
one
beside
him
who
gathered
up
his
hat
and
umbrella
and
with
some
commotion
pushed
his
way
between
the
rows
of
seats
philip
followed
thankful
of
the
opportunity
and
as
it
happened
the
sensation
of
the
day
being
over
many
others
followed
too
and
thus
he
got
out
into
the
curious
wondering
daylight
which
seemed
to
look
him
in
the
face
as
if
this
philip
had
never
been
seen
by
it
before
that
was
the
impression
given
him
that
when
he
first
came
out
the
atmosphere
quivered
round
him
with
a
strange
novelty
as
if
he
were
some
other
being
some
one
without
a
name
new
to
the
world
new
to
himself
he
did
not
seem
sure
that
he
would
know
his
way
home
and
yet
he
did
not
call
a
passing
hansom
as
he
would
have
done
yesterday
with
a
schoolboy
pleasure
in
assuming
a
man
careless
easy
ways
it
is
a
long
way
from
the
law
courts
to
ebury
street
but
it
seemed
a
kind
of
satisfaction
to
be
in
motion
to
walk
on
along
the
crowded
streets
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
philip
did
lose
his
way
and
got
himself
entangled
in
a
web
of
narrow
streets
and
monotonous
little
openings
all
so
like
each
other
that
it
took
him
a
long
time
to
extricate
himself
and
find
again
the
thread
of
a
locality
known
to
him
he
did
not
know
what
he
was
to
do
when
he
got
in
should
he
find
her
there
in
the
little
dingy
as
usual
with
the
tea
on
the
table
would
she
receive
him
with
her
usual
smile
and
ask
where
he
had
been
and
what
he
had
seen
and
if
the
musgraves
had
enjoyed
it
exactly
as
if
nothing
had
happened
even
this
wonder
was
faint
in
philip
mind
for
the
chief
wonder
to
him
was
himself
and
to
find
out
how
he
had
changed
since
the
morning
what
he
was
now
who
he
was
what
were
the
relations
to
him
of
other
people
of
that
other
philip
compton
who
had
been
seated
in
the
court
with
the
who
had
arrived
at
windyhill
to
visit
elinor
dennistoun
on
the
of
september
twenty
years
ago
who
was
that
man
and
what
was
he
himself
philip
compton
of
lakeside
named
pippo
whom
his
mother
had
never
once
in
all
his
life
called
by
his
real
name
to
his
great
wonder
and
yet
almost
relief
philip
found
that
his
mother
had
not
yet
returned
when
he
got
to
ebury
street
compton
said
as
she
would
very
likely
be
late
can
i
get
you
some
tea
sir
or
perhaps
you
have
had
your
lunch
you
looking
tired
and
worrited
said
the
landlady
who
had
known
pippo
all
his
life
he
consented
to
have
tea
partly
to
fill
up
the
time
and
went
up
languidly
to
the
deserted
room
which
looked
so
miserable
and
desert
a
place
without
her
who
put
a
soul
into
it
and
made
it
home
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
himself
poor
boy
but
sat
down
vacantly
and
stared
into
empty
space
seeing
wherever
he
turned
the
rows
of
faces
the
ladies
making
signs
to
each
other
the
red
robes
of
the
judge
the
lawyers
contending
and
that
motionless
pale
figure
in
the
he
shut
his
eyes
and
saw
the
whole
scene
then
opened
them
again
and
still
saw
it
the
dingy
walls
disappearing
the
greyness
of
the
afternoon
giving
a
depth
and
distance
to
the
limited
space
should
he
always
carry
it
about
with
him
wherever
he
went
the
vision
of
that
court
the
shock
of
that
revelation
and
yet
he
did
not
yet
know
what
the
revelation
was
the
confusion
in
his
mind
was
too
great
and
the
dust
and
mist
that
rose
up
about
him
as
all
the
old
building
of
his
life
crumbled
and
fell
away
i
sure
as
it
that
nasty
trial
sir
as
has
been
turning
your
mamma
all
out
of
her
usual
ways
said
the
landlady
appearing
with
her
tray
oh
the
trial
did
you
know
about
the
trial
said
philip
not
pippo
as
ever
she
mentioned
it
to
me
compton
is
a
lady
as
is
that
confidential
though
always
an
affable
lady
and
not
a
bit
proud
but
when
you
known
folks
for
years
and
years
and
take
an
interest
and
put
this
and
that
together
dear
dear
i
hope
as
you
do
think
it
taking
a
liberty
it
more
kindness
nor
curiosity
and
i
hope
as
you
wo
mention
it
to
your
mamma
pippo
shook
his
head
and
waved
his
hand
at
once
to
satisfy
the
woman
and
dismiss
her
if
possible
but
this
was
not
so
easy
to
do
and
lord
serf
so
bad
sir
she
said
lord
to
think
that
before
we
know
where
we
are
there
may
be
such
changes
and
new
names
and
no
knowing
what
to
say
but
it
best
not
to
talk
of
it
till
it
comes
to
pass
for
there
many
a
slip
between
the
cup
and
the
lip
and
no
saying
what
will
happen
with
a
man
that
been
for
years
and
years
what
did
the
woman
mean
he
got
rid
of
her
at
length
chiefly
by
dint
of
making
no
reply
and
then
to
tell
the
truth
pippo
eye
had
been
caught
by
the
pile
of
sandwiches
which
the
kind
woman
pitying
his
tired
looks
had
brought
up
with
the
tea
he
was
ashamed
of
himself
for
being
hungry
in
such
a
dreadful
emergency
as
this
but
he
was
so
and
could
not
help
it
though
nothing
would
have
made
him
confess
so
much
or
even
touch
the
sandwiches
till
she
had
gone
away
he
pretended
to
ignore
them
till
the
door
was
shut
after
her
but
could
not
help
vividly
remembering
that
he
had
eaten
nothing
since
the
morning
the
sandwiches
did
him
a
little
good
in
his
mind
as
well
as
in
his
body
he
got
rid
of
the
vision
of
the
faces
and
of
the
red
figure
on
the
bench
he
began
to
believe
that
when
he
saw
her
she
would
tell
him
had
she
not
said
so
that
after
awhile
he
should
hear
everything
and
that
all
should
be
as
it
was
before
all
as
it
was
before
in
the
time
when
she
told
him
everything
even
things
that
granny
did
not
know
but
she
had
never
told
him
this
and
the
other
day
she
had
told
him
that
it
was
other
people
secrets
not
her
own
that
she
was
keeping
from
him
other
people
secrets
the
secrets
of
the
man
who
was
philip
compton
who
went
to
windyhill
on
the
of
september
ten
days
before
elinor
dennistoun
marriage
day
what
philip
compton
who
was
he
what
had
he
to
do
with
her
what
oh
what
pippo
said
to
himself
has
he
to
do
with
me
after
all
that
was
the
most
tremendous
question
the
others
or
anything
that
had
happened
twenty
years
ago
were
nothing
to
that
meanwhile
elinor
of
all
places
in
the
world
was
in
john
chambers
to
which
he
had
taken
her
to
rest
i
can
not
tell
how
tatham
a
man
so
much
occupied
managed
to
subtract
from
all
he
had
to
do
almost
a
whole
day
to
see
his
cousin
through
the
trial
and
stand
by
her
sparing
her
all
the
lesser
annoyances
which
surround
and
exaggerate
such
a
great
fact
he
had
brought
her
out
into
the
fresh
air
feeling
that
movement
was
the
best
thing
for
her
and
instead
of
taking
her
home
in
the
carriage
which
was
waiting
had
made
her
walk
with
him
supported
on
his
arm
on
which
she
hung
in
a
sort
of
suspended
life
across
the
street
to
the
temple
hoping
thus
to
bring
her
back
by
the
necessity
of
exertion
to
herself
and
indeed
she
was
almost
more
restored
to
herself
by
this
remedy
than
john
tatham
had
expected
or
hoped
for
though
he
placed
her
in
the
great
in
which
her
slender
person
was
engulfed
and
supported
expecting
her
to
rest
there
and
lie
motionless
perhaps
even
to
faint
as
women
are
supposed
to
do
when
it
is
particularly
inconvenient
and
uncomfortable
elinor
had
not
been
there
two
minutes
before
she
rose
up
again
and
began
to
walk
about
the
room
with
an
aspect
so
unlike
that
of
an
exhausted
and
perhaps
fainting
woman
that
even
john
used
as
he
was
to
her
capricious
ways
was
confounded
instead
of
being
subdued
and
thankful
that
it
was
over
and
this
dreadful
crisis
in
her
life
accomplished
elinor
walked
up
and
down
wringing
her
hands
moaning
and
murmuring
to
herself
what
was
it
she
was
saying
god
forgive
me
god
forgive
me
over
and
over
and
over
unconscious
apparently
that
she
was
not
alone
that
any
one
heard
or
observed
her
no
doubt
there
is
in
all
our
actions
the
very
best
much
for
god
to
forgive
mingled
motives
imperfect
deeds
thoughts
full
of
alloy
and
selfishness
but
in
what
her
conscience
could
accuse
her
now
he
could
not
understand
she
might
be
to
blame
in
respect
to
her
husband
though
he
was
very
loth
to
allow
the
possibility
but
in
this
act
of
her
life
which
had
been
so
great
a
strain
upon
her
it
was
surely
without
any
selfishness
for
his
interest
only
not
for
her
own
and
yet
john
had
never
seen
such
a
fervour
of
penitence
so
strong
a
consciousness
of
evil
done
he
went
up
to
her
and
laid
his
hand
upon
her
arm
elinor
you
are
worn
out
you
have
done
too
much
will
you
try
and
rest
a
little
here
or
shall
i
take
you
home
she
started
violently
when
he
touched
her
what
was
i
saying
she
said
it
does
not
matter
what
you
were
saying
sit
down
and
rest
you
will
wear
yourself
out
do
think
any
more
take
this
and
rest
a
little
and
then
i
will
take
you
home
it
is
easy
to
say
so
she
said
with
a
faint
smile
do
think
is
it
possible
to
stop
thinking
at
one
pleasure
yes
said
john
quite
possible
we
must
all
do
it
or
we
should
die
and
now
your
trial
over
nelly
for
goodness
sake
exert
yourself
and
throw
it
off
you
have
done
your
duty
my
duty
do
you
think
that
was
my
duty
oh
john
there
are
so
many
ways
to
look
at
it
only
one
way
when
you
have
a
man
safety
in
your
hands
only
one
way
when
one
has
a
man
safety
his
honour
honour
do
you
think
a
woman
is
justified
in
whatever
she
does
to
save
that
i
do
understand
you
elinor
in
anything
you
have
done
or
could
do
certainly
you
are
justified
my
dear
nelly
sit
down
and
take
this
and
then
i
will
take
you
home
she
took
the
wine
from
his
hand
and
swallowed
a
little
of
it
and
then
looking
up
into
his
face
with
the
faint
smile
which
she
put
on
when
she
expected
to
be
blamed
and
intended
to
deprecate
and
disarm
him
as
she
had
done
so
often
i
do
know
she
said
that
i
am
so
anxious
to
get
home
john
you
were
to
take
pippo
to
dine
with
you
and
to
the
house
so
i
was
he
said
we
did
not
know
what
day
you
would
be
called
it
is
a
great
nuisance
but
if
you
think
the
boy
would
be
disappointed
not
to
go
he
would
be
much
much
disappointed
the
first
chance
he
has
had
of
hearing
a
debate
he
would
be
much
better
at
home
taking
care
of
you
as
if
i
wanted
taking
care
of
or
as
if
the
boy
who
has
always
been
the
object
of
everybody
care
himself
would
be
the
proper
person
to
do
it
if
he
had
been
a
girl
perhaps
but
it
is
a
little
late
at
this
time
of
day
to
wish
for
that
now
you
were
to
tell
him
everything
elinor
oh
i
was
to
tell
him
do
you
think
i
have
not
had
enough
for
one
day
enough
to
wear
me
out
body
and
soul
you
have
just
been
telling
me
so
john
he
shook
his
head
you
know
he
said
and
i
know
that
in
any
case
you
will
have
it
your
own
way
elinor
but
you
have
promised
to
tell
him
john
you
are
unkind
you
take
advantage
of
me
being
here
and
so
broken
down
to
say
that
i
will
have
my
own
way
has
this
been
my
own
way
at
all
i
would
have
fled
if
i
could
and
taken
the
boy
far
far
away
from
it
all
but
you
would
not
let
me
yes
yes
i
have
promised
but
i
am
tired
to
death
how
could
i
look
him
in
the
face
and
tell
him
she
hid
her
face
suddenly
in
her
hands
with
a
moan
it
will
be
in
the
papers
morning
elinor
well
i
will
tell
him
morning
she
said
john
shook
his
head
again
but
it
was
done
behind
her
where
she
could
not
see
the
movement
he
had
more
pity
of
her
than
words
could
say
when
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
in
that
most
pathetic
of
attitudes
there
was
nothing
that
he
would
not
have
forgiven
her
what
was
to
become
of
her
now
her
position
through
all
these
years
had
never
been
so
dangerous
in
john
opinion
never
so
sad
as
now
philip
compton
had
been
there
looking
on
while
she
put
his
accusers
to
silence
at
what
cost
to
herself
john
only
began
dimly
to
guess
to
divine
to
forbid
himself
to
inquire
the
fellow
had
been
there
all
the
time
he
had
the
grace
not
to
look
at
her
not
to
distract
her
with
the
sight
of
him
probably
for
his
own
sake
john
thought
bitterly
that
she
might
not
risk
breaking
down
but
he
was
there
and
knew
where
she
was
to
be
found
and
he
had
seen
the
boy
and
had
cared
enough
to
fix
his
gaze
upon
him
that
gaze
which
john
had
found
intolerable
at
the
theatre
and
he
was
on
the
eve
of
becoming
lord
serf
and
pippo
his
heir
what
was
to
be
the
issue
of
these
complications
what
was
to
happen
to
her
who
had
hid
the
boy
so
long
who
certainly
could
hide
him
no
more
he
took
her
home
to
ebury
street
shortly
after
where
philip
weary
of
waiting
and
having
made
a
meal
he
much
wanted
off
the
sandwiches
had
gone
out
again
in
his
restlessness
and
unhappiness
elinor
who
had
become
paler
and
paler
as
the
carriage
approached
ebury
street
and
who
by
the
time
she
reached
the
house
looked
really
as
if
at
last
she
must
swoon
her
heart
choking
her
her
breathing
quick
and
feverish
had
taken
hold
of
john
to
support
herself
clutching
at
his
arm
when
she
was
told
that
philip
was
out
she
came
to
herself
instantly
on
the
strength
of
that
news
tell
him
when
he
comes
in
to
make
haste
she
said
for
tatham
is
waiting
for
him
as
for
me
i
am
fit
for
nothing
but
bed
i
have
had
a
very
tiring
day
you
do
look
tired
said
the
sympathetic
landlady
i
run
up
and
put
your
room
ready
and
then
i
make
you
a
nice
cup
of
tea
john
tatham
thought
that
notwithstanding
her
exhaustion
her
anxiety
all
the
realities
of
troubles
present
and
to
come
that
were
in
her
mind
and
in
her
way
there
was
a
flash
something
like
triumph
in
eyes
tell
pippo
she
said
he
can
come
up
and
say
to
me
before
he
goes
i
am
good
for
nothing
but
my
bed
if
i
can
sleep
i
shall
be
able
for
all
that
is
before
me
the
triumph
was
quenched
however
if
there
had
been
triumph
when
she
gave
him
her
hand
with
a
wistful
smile
and
a
sigh
that
filled
that
with
the
terror
and
the
trouble
that
must
be
in
it
did
she
do
what
she
said
john
went
up
to
the
little
to
wait
for
pippo
with
a
heavy
heart
it
seemed
to
him
that
never
had
elinor
been
in
so
much
danger
she
had
exposed
herself
to
the
chance
of
losing
the
allegiance
of
her
son
she
was
at
the
mercy
of
her
husband
that
husband
whom
she
had
renounced
yet
whom
she
had
not
refused
to
save
whose
call
she
had
obeyed
to
help
him
though
she
had
thrown
off
all
the
bonds
of
love
and
duty
towards
him
she
had
not
had
the
strength
either
way
to
be
consistent
to
carry
out
one
steady
policy
it
was
cruel
of
john
to
say
this
for
but
for
him
and
his
remonstrances
elinor
would
or
might
have
fled
and
avoided
this
last
ordeal
but
he
had
not
done
so
and
now
here
she
was
in
the
middle
of
her
life
her
frail
ship
of
safety
driven
about
among
the
rocks
dependent
upon
the
magnanimity
of
the
husband
from
whom
she
had
fled
and
the
child
whom
she
had
deceived
your
mother
is
very
tired
philip
he
said
when
the
boy
appeared
i
was
to
tell
you
to
go
up
and
bid
her
before
you
went
out
for
it
will
probably
be
late
before
you
get
back
if
you
think
you
are
game
to
sit
out
the
debate
i
will
sit
it
out
said
philip
with
no
laughter
in
his
eye
with
an
almost
solemn
air
as
if
announcing
a
grave
resolution
he
went
not
three
steps
at
a
time
as
was
his
wont
but
soberly
as
if
his
years
had
been
forty
instead
of
eighteen
and
he
showed
no
surprise
to
find
the
room
darkened
though
elinor
was
a
woman
who
loved
the
light
he
gave
his
mother
a
kiss
and
smoothed
her
pillow
with
a
tender
touch
of
pity
is
your
head
very
bad
he
said
it
is
only
that
i
am
dreadfully
tired
pippo
i
hope
i
shall
sleep
and
it
will
help
me
to
think
you
are
happy
with
uncle
john
then
i
shall
try
to
be
happy
with
uncle
john
he
said
with
a
sort
of
smile
mother
i
hope
you
be
better
oh
yes
she
said
is
always
a
new
day
he
seemed
in
the
half
light
to
nod
his
head
and
then
to
shake
it
as
one
that
assents
but
doubts
having
many
troubled
thoughts
and
questions
in
his
mind
but
pippo
did
not
at
all
expect
to
be
happy
with
uncle
john
chapter
xlvi
it
can
not
be
said
that
uncle
john
was
very
happy
with
philip
but
that
was
a
thing
the
others
did
not
take
into
account
john
tatham
was
doing
for
the
boy
as
much
as
a
man
could
do
a
great
debate
was
expected
that
evening
in
which
many
eminent
persons
were
to
speak
and
tatham
gave
philip
a
hasty
dinner
in
the
house
so
that
he
should
lose
nothing
and
he
found
him
a
corner
in
the
distinguished
strangers
gallery
telling
him
with
a
smile
that
he
expected
him
hereafter
to
prove
his
title
to
such
a
place
but
philip
smile
in
return
was
very
unlike
the
flush
of
pleasure
that
would
have
lighted
it
up
only
yesterday
john
felt
that
the
boy
was
not
at
all
the
delightful
young
companion
full
of
interest
in
everything
that
he
had
been
perhaps
he
was
on
his
good
behaviour
on
his
dignity
bent
upon
showing
how
much
of
a
man
he
was
and
how
little
influenced
by
passing
sentiments
as
some
boys
do
anyhow
it
was
certain
that
he
was
much
less
agreeable
in
his
condition
but
john
was
fortunately
much
interested
in
the
discussion
in
which
indeed
he
took
himself
a
slight
part
and
save
for
a
passing
wonder
and
the
disappointment
of
the
moment
did
not
occupy
himself
so
very
much
with
pippo
when
he
looked
into
the
corner
however
in
a
lull
of
the
debate
when
one
of
those
fools
who
rush
in
at
unguarded
moments
when
the
speaker
chances
to
look
their
way
had
managed
to
get
upon
his
foolish
feet
to
the
despair
of
all
around
the
experienced
man
of
the
world
received
a
curious
shock
from
the
sight
of
young
philip
intense
gravity
and
the
unconscious
look
he
wore
the
boy
had
the
look
of
hearing
nothing
seeing
nothing
that
was
around
him
of
being
lost
in
thoughts
of
his
own
thoughts
far
too
serious
and
troubled
for
his
age
had
he
discovered
something
what
did
he
know
this
was
the
instinctive
question
that
rose
in
john
mind
and
not
an
amused
anticipation
of
pippo
original
boyish
view
of
the
question
and
the
speakers
such
as
had
delighted
him
on
the
boy
previous
visits
to
the
house
and
indeed
philip
attention
was
little
fixed
upon
the
debate
he
tried
hard
to
bring
it
back
to
keep
it
there
to
get
the
question
into
his
mind
but
in
spite
of
himself
his
thoughts
flew
back
to
the
other
public
assembly
in
which
he
had
sat
unnoticed
that
day
till
gradually
the
aspect
of
things
changed
to
him
the
speaker
became
the
judge
the
wigged
secretaries
the
pleaders
and
he
almost
expected
to
see
that
sudden
apparition
that
sight
that
had
plucked
him
out
of
his
careless
life
of
boyhood
and
trust
the
sight
of
his
mother
standing
before
the
world
on
trial
for
her
life
oh
no
no
not
on
trial
at
all
he
was
aware
of
that
a
harmless
witness
doing
only
good
the
judge
could
have
nothing
but
polite
regard
for
her
the
jury
admiration
and
thanks
for
the
clear
testimony
which
took
a
weight
from
their
shoulders
but
before
her
son
she
was
on
her
trial
her
trial
for
more
than
life
and
he
who
said
with
so
much
assurance
that
his
mother
had
no
secrets
from
him
until
the
moment
arrived
without
any
warning
in
the
midst
of
his
security
which
proved
that
everything
had
been
secret
and
that
all
was
mystery
all
mystery
and
nothing
sure
in
life
it
crossed
philip
mind
more
than
once
to
question
john
tatham
upon
this
dreadful
discovery
of
his
john
who
was
a
relation
who
had
been
the
universal
referee
of
the
household
as
long
as
he
could
remember
uncle
john
must
know
but
there
were
two
things
which
held
him
back
first
the
recollection
of
his
own
disdainful
offence
at
the
suggestion
that
uncle
john
an
outsider
could
know
more
than
he
did
of
the
family
concerns
and
partly
from
the
proud
determination
to
ask
no
questions
to
seek
no
information
that
was
not
freely
given
to
him
he
made
up
his
mind
to
this
while
he
looked
out
from
his
corner
upon
the
lighted
house
seeing
men
move
up
and
down
and
voices
going
on
and
the
sound
of
restless
members
coming
and
going
while
the
business
of
the
country
went
on
it
was
far
more
important
than
any
private
affairs
that
could
be
passing
in
an
individual
brain
and
philip
knew
with
what
certainty
he
would
have
put
down
the
idea
that
to
himself
at
his
age
there
could
be
anything
private
half
so
exciting
half
so
full
of
interest
as
a
debate
on
the
policy
of
the
country
which
might
carry
with
it
the
highest
issues
but
conviction
comes
readily
on
such
subjects
when
the
personal
interest
comes
which
carries
every
other
away
it
was
while
a
minister
was
speaking
and
everything
hanging
on
his
words
that
the
boy
made
up
his
mind
finally
that
he
would
ask
no
questions
he
would
ignore
that
scene
in
the
law
courts
as
if
it
had
not
been
he
would
say
nothing
try
to
look
as
if
nothing
had
passed
and
wait
to
see
if
any
explanation
would
come
it
was
not
perhaps
then
to
be
wondered
at
if
john
found
him
a
much
less
interesting
companion
than
ever
before
as
they
walked
home
together
in
the
small
hours
of
the
night
tatham
own
speech
had
been
short
but
he
had
the
agreeable
consciousness
that
it
had
been
an
effective
one
and
he
was
prepared
to
find
the
boy
excited
by
it
and
full
of
applause
and
satisfaction
but
philip
did
not
say
a
word
about
the
speech
he
was
only
a
boy
and
it
may
be
supposed
that
any
applause
from
him
would
have
had
little
importance
for
the
famous
lawyer
the
member
who
kept
his
independence
and
whose
speeches
always
secured
the
attention
of
the
house
and
carried
weight
as
among
the
few
utterances
which
concerned
the
real
import
of
a
question
and
not
its
mere
party
meaning
but
john
was
hurt
more
than
he
could
have
thought
possible
by
philip
silence
he
even
tried
to
lead
the
conversation
artfully
to
that
point
in
the
debate
thinking
perhaps
the
boy
was
shy
of
speaking
on
the
subject
but
with
no
effect
it
was
exceedingly
strange
had
he
been
deceived
in
philip
had
the
boy
really
no
interest
in
subjects
of
an
elevated
description
or
was
he
ill
or
what
was
the
matter
with
him
it
troubled
john
to
let
him
go
on
alone
from
halkin
street
to
his
lodging
with
a
vague
sense
that
something
might
happen
but
that
was
of
course
too
absurd
tell
your
mother
i
come
round
in
the
afternoon
as
soon
as
i
am
free
he
said
holding
philip
hand
and
then
he
added
paternally
still
holding
that
hand
go
to
bed
at
once
boy
you
had
a
tiring
day
yes
i
suppose
so
said
philip
drawing
his
hand
away
i
hope
you
have
done
too
much
said
john
still
lingering
too
young
for
politics
and
to
sit
up
so
late
i
was
wrong
to
keep
you
out
of
bed
i
hope
i
not
such
a
child
as
that
said
philip
with
a
and
then
he
went
away
and
john
tatham
with
an
anxious
heart
closed
behind
him
his
own
door
if
it
were
not
for
elinor
and
her
boy
what
a
life
free
of
anxiety
john
would
have
had
never
any
need
to
think
with
solicitude
of
anything
outside
that
peaceful
door
no
trouble
with
other
people
feelings
with
investigations
what
this
or
that
look
or
word
meant
but
perhaps
it
was
elinor
and
her
boy
after
all
none
of
his
thinking
of
him
as
an
outsider
having
nothing
to
do
with
their
most
intimate
circle
of
confidence
and
natural
defence
who
by
means
of
that
very
anxiety
kept
alive
the
higher
principles
of
humanity
in
john
tatham
heart
philip
went
home
walking
quickly
through
the
silent
streets
they
were
very
silent
at
that
advanced
hour
yet
not
so
completely
but
that
there
was
a
woman
who
came
up
to
the
boy
at
the
corner
philip
neither
knew
nor
desired
to
know
what
she
said
he
thought
nothing
about
her
one
way
or
another
he
took
a
shilling
out
of
his
pocket
and
threw
it
to
her
as
he
passed
walking
on
with
the
quick
elastic
step
which
the
sudden
acquaintance
he
had
made
with
care
had
not
been
able
to
subdue
he
saw
that
there
was
still
a
faint
light
in
his
mother
window
when
he
reached
the
house
but
he
would
not
disturb
her
how
little
would
he
have
thought
of
disturbing
her
on
any
other
occasion
are
you
asleep
mother
he
would
have
said
looking
in
and
the
time
had
never
been
when
elinor
was
asleep
she
had
always
heard
him
always
replied
always
been
delighted
to
hear
the
account
of
what
he
had
been
doing
and
how
he
had
enjoyed
himself
but
not
with
a
heart
full
of
longing
yet
of
a
sick
revolt
against
the
sight
of
her
he
went
past
her
door
to
his
room
he
did
not
want
to
see
her
and
yet
oh
if
she
had
only
called
to
him
if
she
had
but
said
a
word
elinor
for
her
part
was
not
asleep
she
had
slept
a
little
while
she
was
sure
that
philip
was
safely
disposed
of
and
herself
secured
from
all
interruption
but
when
the
time
came
for
his
return
she
slept
no
longer
and
had
been
lying
for
a
long
time
holding
her
breath
listening
to
every
sound
when
she
heard
his
key
in
the
latch
and
his
foot
on
the
stair
would
he
come
in
as
he
always
did
or
would
he
remember
her
complaint
of
being
tired
a
complaint
she
so
seldom
made
it
was
as
a
blow
to
elinor
when
she
heard
his
step
go
on
past
her
door
and
yet
she
was
glad
had
he
come
in
there
was
a
desperate
thought
in
her
mind
that
she
would
call
him
to
her
bedside
and
in
the
dark
with
his
hand
in
hers
tell
him
all
that
there
was
to
tell
but
it
was
again
a
relief
when
he
passed
on
and
she
felt
that
she
was
spared
for
an
hour
or
two
spared
for
the
new
day
which
perhaps
would
give
her
courage
it
was
an
endless
night
long
hours
of
dark
and
then
longer
hours
of
morning
light
too
early
for
anything
while
still
nobody
in
the
house
was
stirring
she
had
scarcely
slept
at
all
during
that
long
age
of
weary
and
terrible
thought
for
it
was
not
as
if
she
had
but
one
thing
to
think
of
when
her
mind
turned
like
her
restless
body
from
one
side
to
another
it
was
only
to
a
change
of
pain
what
was
it
she
had
said
standing
up
before
earth
and
heaven
and
calling
god
to
witness
that
what
she
said
was
true
it
had
been
true
and
yet
she
knew
that
it
was
not
and
that
she
had
saved
her
husband
honour
at
the
cost
of
her
own
oh
not
in
those
serious
and
awful
watches
of
the
night
can
such
a
defence
be
accepted
as
that
the
letter
of
her
testimony
was
true
she
did
not
attempt
to
defend
herself
she
only
tried
to
turn
to
another
thought
that
might
be
less
bitter
and
then
she
was
confronted
by
the
confession
that
she
must
make
to
her
boy
she
must
tell
him
that
she
had
deceived
him
all
his
life
hid
from
him
what
he
ought
to
have
known
separated
him
from
his
father
and
his
family
kept
him
in
ignorance
despite
all
that
had
been
said
to
her
despite
every
argument
and
when
elinor
in
her
misery
fled
from
that
thought
what
was
there
else
to
think
of
there
was
her
husband
pippo
father
from
whom
he
could
no
longer
be
kept
if
she
had
thought
herself
justified
in
stealing
her
child
away
out
of
fear
of
the
influence
that
father
might
have
upon
him
how
would
it
be
now
when
they
must
be
restored
to
each
other
at
an
age
much
more
dangerous
for
the
boy
than
in
childhood
and
with
all
the
attractions
of
mystery
and
novelty
and
the
sense
that
his
father
had
been
wronged
when
she
escaped
from
that
the
most
terrible
thought
of
all
feeling
her
brain
whirl
and
her
heart
burn
as
she
imagined
her
child
turning
from
the
mother
who
had
deceived
him
to
the
father
who
had
been
deprived
of
him
her
mind
went
off
to
that
father
himself
from
whom
she
had
fled
whom
she
had
judged
and
condemned
but
who
had
repaid
her
by
no
persecution
no
interference
no
pursuit
but
an
acceptance
of
her
verdict
never
molesting
her
leaving
her
safe
in
the
possession
of
her
boy
perhaps
there
were
other
ways
in
which
phil
magnanimity
have
been
looked
at
in
which
it
would
have
shown
in
less
favourable
colours
but
elinor
was
not
ready
to
take
that
view
her
tower
of
justice
and
truth
and
honour
had
crumbled
over
her
head
she
was
standing
among
her
ruins
feeling
that
nothing
was
left
to
her
nothing
upon
which
she
could
build
herself
a
structure
of
all
was
wrong
a
series
of
mistakes
and
failures
to
say
no
worse
she
had
driven
on
ever
wilful
all
through
escaping
from
every
pang
she
could
avoid
throwing
off
every
yoke
that
she
did
not
choose
to
bear
until
now
here
she
stood
to
face
all
that
she
had
fled
from
unable
to
elude
them
more
meeting
them
as
so
many
ghosts
in
her
way
oh
how
true
it
was
what
john
had
said
to
her
so
long
so
long
ago
that
she
was
not
one
who
would
bear
who
if
she
were
disappointed
and
wronged
could
endure
and
surmount
her
trouble
by
patience
oh
no
no
she
had
been
one
who
had
put
up
with
nothing
who
had
taken
her
own
way
and
now
she
was
surrounded
on
every
side
by
the
difficulties
she
had
thrust
away
from
her
but
which
now
could
be
thrust
away
no
more
it
may
be
imagined
what
the
night
was
which
elinor
spent
sleepless
struggling
one
after
another
with
these
thoughts
finding
no
comfort
anywhere
wherever
she
turned
she
had
not
been
without
many
a
struggle
even
in
the
most
quiet
of
the
years
that
had
passed
in
one
long
dream
of
peace
as
it
seemed
now
but
never
as
now
had
she
been
met
wherever
she
turned
by
another
and
another
lion
in
the
way
she
got
up
very
early
with
a
feeling
that
movement
had
something
lulling
and
soothing
in
it
and
that
to
lie
there
a
prey
to
all
these
thoughts
was
like
lying
on
the
rack
to
the
great
surprise
of
the
kind
landlady
who
came
stealing
into
her
room
with
the
inevitable
cup
of
tea
and
whose
inquiry
how
the
poor
lady
was
was
taken
out
of
her
mouth
by
the
unexpected
apparition
of
the
supposed
invalid
fully
dressed
moving
about
the
room
with
all
the
air
of
having
been
up
for
hours
elinor
asked
with
a
sudden
precaution
that
the
newspapers
might
be
brought
up
to
her
not
so
much
for
her
own
satisfaction
for
it
made
her
heart
sick
to
think
of
reading
over
in
dreadful
print
as
would
be
done
that
morning
at
millions
of
her
own
words
perhaps
with
comments
on
herself
and
her
history
which
might
fall
into
pippo
hands
and
be
read
by
him
before
he
knew
which
was
a
sudden
spur
to
herself
and
evidence
of
the
dread
necessity
of
letting
him
know
that
story
from
her
own
lips
which
had
not
occurred
to
her
before
she
glanced
over
the
report
with
a
sickening
sense
that
all
the
privacy
of
sheltered
life
and
honourable
silence
was
torn
off
from
her
and
that
she
was
exposed
as
on
a
pillory
to
the
stare
and
the
remarks
of
the
world
and
crushed
the
paper
away
like
a
noxious
thing
into
a
drawer
where
the
boy
at
least
would
never
find
it
vain
thought
as
if
there
was
but
one
paper
in
the
world
as
if
he
could
not
find
it
at
every
street
corner
thrust
into
his
hand
even
as
he
walked
along
but
at
all
events
for
the
moment
he
would
not
see
it
and
she
would
have
time
time
to
tell
him
before
that
revelation
could
come
in
his
way
she
went
with
what
a
tremor
in
her
and
sinking
of
her
heart
it
would
be
impossible
to
say
to
have
to
condemn
herself
to
her
only
child
to
humble
herself
before
him
her
boy
who
thought
there
was
no
one
like
his
mother
to
let
him
know
that
he
had
been
deceived
all
his
life
he
who
thought
she
had
always
told
him
everything
oh
poor
mother
and
oh
poor
boy
she
was
still
sitting
by
the
waiting
in
a
chill
fever
if
such
a
thing
can
be
for
philip
when
a
thing
occurred
which
no
one
could
have
thought
of
and
yet
which
was
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
which
came
upon
elinor
like
a
thunderbolt
shattering
all
her
plans
again
just
at
the
moment
when
after
so
much
shrinking
and
delay
she
had
at
last
made
up
her
mind
to
the
one
thing
that
must
be
done
at
once
the
sound
of
the
driving
up
of
a
cab
to
the
door
made
her
go
to
the
window
to
look
out
without
producing
any
expectation
in
her
mind
for
people
were
coming
and
going
in
ebury
street
all
day
long
she
saw
however
a
box
which
she
recognised
upon
the
cab
and
then
the
door
was
opened
and
dennistoun
stepped
out
her
mother
the
wonder
was
not
that
she
came
now
but
that
she
had
not
come
much
sooner
no
letters
for
several
days
her
child
and
her
child
child
in
town
and
trouble
in
the
air
dennistoun
had
borne
it
as
long
as
she
could
but
there
had
come
a
moment
when
she
could
bear
it
no
longer
and
she
too
had
followed
pippo
example
and
taken
the
night
mail
elinor
stood
motionless
at
the
window
and
saw
her
mother
arrive
and
did
not
feel
capable
of
going
to
meet
her
or
of
telling
whether
it
was
some
dreadful
aggravation
of
evil
or
an
interposition
of
providence
to
save
her
for
another
hour
at
least
from
the
ordeal
before
her
chapter
xlvii
dennistoun
had
a
great
deal
to
say
about
herself
and
the
motives
which
had
at
the
last
been
too
much
for
her
which
had
forced
her
to
come
after
her
children
at
a
moment
notice
feeling
that
she
could
bear
the
uncertainty
about
them
no
longer
and
it
was
a
thing
so
unusual
with
her
to
have
much
to
say
about
herself
that
there
was
certainly
something
apologetic
something
in
this
unaccustomed
outburst
perhaps
she
had
begun
to
feel
a
little
the
unconscious
criticism
that
gathers
round
the
elder
person
in
a
house
the
inclination
involuntarily
which
every
one
would
repudiate
yet
which
nevertheless
is
true
to
attribute
to
her
a
want
of
perception
perhaps
oh
not
unkindly
a
little
blunting
of
the
faculties
a
suggestion
quite
unintentional
that
she
is
not
what
she
once
was
she
explained
herself
so
distinctly
that
there
was
no
doubt
there
was
some
in
it
i
had
not
had
a
letter
for
three
days
and
elinor
was
far
more
humble
than
her
wont
i
know
mother
i
felt
as
if
it
were
impossible
to
write
till
it
was
over
my
darling
i
thought
at
last
i
must
come
and
stand
by
you
i
felt
that
i
ought
to
have
seen
that
all
the
time
that
you
should
have
had
your
mother
by
your
side
to
give
you
countenance
i
had
john
with
me
mother
then
it
is
over
dennistoun
cried
and
at
that
moment
pippo
very
late
pale
and
with
eyes
which
were
red
with
sleeplessness
and
perhaps
with
tears
came
in
elinor
gave
her
mother
a
quick
look
almost
of
blame
and
then
turned
to
the
boy
she
did
not
mean
it
and
yet
dennistoun
felt
as
if
the
suggestion
he
might
never
have
known
had
you
not
called
out
like
that
was
in
her
daughter
eyes
pippo
she
said
why
elinor
what
have
you
been
doing
to
the
boy
he
does
not
look
well
said
elinor
suddenly
waking
up
to
that
anxiety
which
had
been
always
so
easily
roused
in
respect
to
pippo
he
was
very
late
last
night
he
was
at
the
house
with
john
she
added
involuntarily
with
an
apology
to
her
mother
for
the
neglect
which
had
extended
to
pippo
too
there
is
nothing
the
matter
with
me
he
said
with
a
touch
of
sullenness
in
his
tone
the
two
women
looked
at
each
other
with
all
the
vague
trouble
in
their
eyes
suddenly
concentrated
upon
young
philip
but
they
said
nothing
more
as
he
sat
down
at
table
and
began
to
play
with
the
breakfast
for
which
he
had
evidently
no
appetite
no
one
had
ever
seen
that
sullen
look
in
pippo
face
before
he
bent
his
head
over
the
table
as
if
he
were
intent
upon
the
food
which
choked
him
when
he
tried
to
eat
and
which
he
loathed
the
very
sight
of
and
did
not
say
a
word
they
had
certainly
not
been
very
before
but
the
sight
of
the
boy
thus
obscured
and
changed
made
all
the
misery
more
evident
there
was
always
a
possibility
of
the
storm
so
long
as
all
was
well
with
pippo
but
his
changed
countenance
veiled
the
very
sun
in
the
skies
you
do
seem
surprised
to
see
me
here
his
grandmother
said
oh
no
i
am
not
surprised
i
wonder
you
did
not
come
sooner
have
you
been
travelling
all
night
he
said
just
as
you
did
pippo
i
drove
into
penrith
last
night
and
caught
the
mail
train
i
was
seized
with
a
panic
about
you
and
felt
that
i
must
see
for
myself
it
is
not
the
first
time
you
have
taken
a
panic
about
us
mother
said
elinor
forcing
a
smile
no
but
it
is
almost
the
first
time
i
have
acted
upon
it
said
dennistoun
with
that
faint
instinct
of
but
i
think
you
must
have
needed
me
more
than
usual
to
keep
you
in
order
you
must
have
been
going
out
too
much
keeping
late
hours
you
are
pale
enough
elinor
but
pippo
pippo
has
suffered
still
more
i
tell
you
said
philip
raising
his
shoulders
and
stooping
his
head
over
the
table
granny
that
there
is
nothing
the
matter
with
me
and
he
took
no
part
in
the
conversation
as
they
went
on
talking
of
any
subjects
but
those
that
were
most
near
their
hearts
they
had
indeed
no
thoughts
at
all
to
spare
but
those
that
were
occupied
with
the
situation
and
with
this
new
feature
in
it
pippo
worn
and
troubled
looks
yet
had
to
talk
of
something
of
nothing
while
the
meal
went
on
which
was
no
meal
at
all
for
any
of
them
when
it
was
over
at
last
pippo
rose
abruptly
from
the
table
are
you
going
out
elinor
said
alarmed
rising
too
have
you
any
engagement
with
the
marshalls
for
i
do
know
philip
said
marshall
was
ill
yesterday
i
see
them
i
not
going
out
i
am
going
to
my
room
you
got
a
headache
pippo
nothing
of
the
kind
i
tell
you
there
is
nothing
the
matter
with
me
i
only
going
to
my
room
elinor
put
her
hands
on
his
arm
pippo
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
before
you
go
out
will
you
promise
to
let
me
know
before
you
go
out
i
do
want
to
keep
you
back
from
anything
but
i
have
something
that
i
must
say
he
did
not
ask
with
his
usual
interest
what
it
was
he
showed
no
curiosity
on
the
contrary
he
drew
his
arm
out
of
her
hold
almost
rudely
of
course
he
said
i
will
come
in
here
before
i
go
out
i
have
no
intention
of
going
out
now
and
thus
he
left
them
and
went
with
a
heavy
step
oh
how
different
from
pippo
flying
foot
so
that
they
could
count
every
step
what
is
the
matter
what
is
the
matter
elinor
i
know
nothing
she
said
nothing
he
was
like
himself
yesterday
morning
full
of
life
unless
he
is
ill
i
can
not
understand
it
but
mother
i
have
to
tell
him
everything
god
grant
it
may
not
be
too
late
elinor
dennistoun
said
too
late
how
can
it
be
too
late
yes
perhaps
you
are
right
john
and
you
he
ought
to
have
known
from
the
beginning
he
ought
to
have
been
told
when
he
was
a
child
i
acknowledge
that
i
was
wrong
but
it
is
no
use
she
said
wiping
away
some
fiery
tears
to
go
back
upon
that
now
john
could
not
have
told
him
anything
dennistoun
said
doubtfully
john
my
best
friend
who
has
always
stood
by
me
oh
never
never
how
little
you
know
him
mother
he
has
been
imploring
me
every
day
almost
upon
his
knees
to
tell
pippo
everything
and
i
promised
to
do
it
as
soon
as
the
time
was
come
and
then
last
night
i
was
so
glad
to
think
that
he
was
engaged
with
john
and
i
so
worn
out
not
fit
for
anything
and
then
this
morning
then
this
morning
i
arrived
just
when
i
would
have
been
better
away
do
say
that
mother
it
is
always
always
well
you
should
be
with
your
children
and
oh
if
i
had
but
taken
your
advice
years
and
years
ago
how
easy
it
is
to
wish
this
when
fate
overtakes
us
when
the
thing
so
long
postponed
so
long
pushed
away
from
us
has
to
be
done
at
last
there
is
i
fear
no
repentance
in
it
only
the
intolerable
sense
that
the
painful
act
might
have
been
over
long
ago
and
the
soul
free
now
of
a
burden
which
is
so
terrible
to
bear
philip
did
not
leave
his
room
all
the
morning
his
mother
overwhelmed
now
by
the
new
anxiety
about
his
health
which
had
no
part
in
her
thoughts
before
went
to
his
door
and
knocked
several
times
always
with
the
intention
of
going
in
of
insisting
upon
the
removal
of
all
barriers
and
of
telling
her
story
the
story
which
now
was
as
fire
in
her
veins
and
had
to
be
told
but
he
had
locked
his
door
and
only
answered
from
within
that
he
was
reading
getting
up
something
that
he
had
forgotten
and
begged
her
to
leave
him
undisturbed
till
lunch
poor
elinor
her
story
was
as
i
have
said
like
fire
in
her
veins
but
when
the
moment
came
and
a
little
more
delay
an
hour
a
morning
was
possible
she
accepted
it
like
a
boon
from
heaven
though
she
knew
very
well
all
the
same
that
it
was
but
prolonging
the
agony
and
that
to
get
it
accomplished
to
get
it
over
was
the
only
thing
to
desire
she
tried
to
arrange
her
thoughts
to
think
how
she
was
to
tell
it
in
the
hurrying
yet
flying
minutes
when
she
sat
alone
listening
now
and
then
to
philip
movements
over
her
head
for
he
was
not
still
as
a
boy
should
be
who
was
reading
but
moved
about
his
room
with
a
nervous
restlessness
that
seemed
almost
equal
to
her
own
dennistoun
to
leave
her
daughter
free
for
the
conversation
that
ought
to
take
place
between
elinor
and
her
son
had
gone
to
lie
down
and
lay
in
room
next
door
to
the
boy
listening
to
every
sound
and
hoping
hoping
that
they
would
get
it
over
before
she
went
again
she
did
not
believe
that
philip
would
stand
out
against
his
mother
whom
he
loved
oh
if
they
could
but
get
it
over
that
explanation
if
the
boy
but
knew
but
it
was
apparent
enough
when
she
came
down
to
luncheon
where
elinor
awaited
her
pale
and
anxious
and
where
philip
followed
so
unlike
himself
that
no
explanation
had
yet
taken
place
between
them
and
the
luncheon
was
as
miserable
a
pretence
at
a
meal
as
the
breakfast
had
been
worse
as
a
repetition
yet
better
in
so
far
that
poor
pippo
with
his
boyish
wholesome
appetite
was
by
this
time
too
hungry
to
be
restrained
even
by
the
unusual
burden
of
his
unhappiness
and
ate
heartily
although
he
was
bitterly
ashamed
of
so
doing
which
perhaps
made
him
a
little
better
and
certainly
did
a
great
deal
of
good
to
the
ladies
who
thus
were
convinced
that
whatever
the
matter
might
be
he
was
not
ill
at
least
he
was
about
to
return
after
luncheon
was
over
but
elinor
caught
him
by
the
arm
you
are
not
going
to
your
room
again
pippo
i
have
not
finished
my
reading
he
said
i
have
a
claim
before
your
reading
i
have
a
great
deal
to
say
to
you
and
i
can
not
put
it
off
any
longer
it
must
be
said
as
you
please
mother
he
replied
with
an
air
of
endurance
and
he
opened
the
door
for
her
and
followed
her
up
to
the
the
three
generations
going
one
before
the
other
the
anxious
grandmother
first
full
of
sympathy
for
both
the
mother
trembling
in
every
limb
feeling
the
great
crisis
of
her
life
before
her
the
boy
with
his
heart
seared
half
bitter
half
contemptuous
of
the
explanation
which
he
had
forestalled
which
came
too
late
dennistoun
turned
and
kissed
first
one
and
then
the
other
with
quivering
lips
oh
pippo
be
kind
to
your
mother
she
never
will
have
such
need
of
your
kindness
again
in
all
your
life
the
boy
could
almost
have
struck
her
for
this
advice
it
raised
a
kind
of
savage
passion
in
him
to
be
told
to
be
kind
to
his
mother
kind
to
her
when
he
had
held
her
above
all
beings
on
the
earth
and
prided
himself
all
his
life
upon
his
devotion
to
her
what
dennistoun
said
to
elinor
i
can
not
tell
but
she
clasped
her
hands
and
gave
her
an
imploring
look
which
was
almost
as
bitterly
taken
as
her
appeal
to
philip
it
besought
her
to
tell
everything
to
hide
nothing
and
what
was
elinor
meaning
but
to
tell
everything
to
lay
bare
her
heart
but
once
more
at
this
moment
an
interruption
the
most
wonderful
and
of
all
interruptions
came
i
suppose
it
must
have
been
announced
by
the
usual
summons
at
the
and
that
in
their
agitation
they
had
not
heard
it
but
all
that
i
know
is
that
when
dennistoun
turned
to
leave
the
mother
and
son
to
their
conversation
which
was
so
full
of
fate
the
door
of
the
opened
almost
upon
her
as
she
was
about
to
go
out
and
with
a
little
demonstration
and
pride
as
of
a
name
which
it
was
a
distinction
even
to
be
permitted
to
say
of
a
visitor
whose
arrival
could
not
be
but
an
honour
and
delightful
surprise
the
husband
of
the
landlady
the
man
of
the
house
once
a
butler
of
the
highest
pretensions
now
only
condescending
to
serve
his
lodgers
when
the
occasion
was
dignified
swept
into
the
room
noiseless
and
solemn
holding
open
the
door
and
announced
lord
st
serf
dennistoun
fell
back
as
if
she
had
met
a
ghost
and
elinor
too
drew
back
a
step
becoming
as
pale
as
if
she
had
been
the
ghost
her
mother
saw
the
gasp
of
the
long
breath
they
both
drew
made
a
sound
in
the
room
where
the
very
air
seemed
to
tingle
and
young
philip
raising
his
head
saw
coming
in
the
man
whom
he
had
seen
in
court
the
man
who
had
gazed
at
him
in
the
theatre
the
man
of
the
but
was
this
then
not
the
philip
compton
for
whom
elinor
dennistoun
had
stood
forth
and
borne
witness
before
all
the
world
he
came
in
and
stood
without
a
word
waiting
for
a
moment
till
the
servant
was
gone
and
the
door
closed
and
then
he
advanced
with
a
step
the
very
assurance
and
quickness
of
which
showed
his
hesitation
and
uncertainty
he
did
not
hold
out
his
hands
much
less
his
arms
to
her
nell
he
said
as
if
he
had
been
asking
a
question
nell
she
seemed
to
open
her
lips
to
speak
but
brought
forth
no
sound
and
then
dennistoun
came
in
with
the
grave
voice
of
every
day
will
you
sit
down
he
looked
round
at
her
perceiving
her
for
the
first
time
ah
he
said
mamma
how
good
that
you
are
here
it
is
a
little
droll
though
do
you
think
when
a
man
comes
into
the
bosom
of
his
family
after
an
absence
of
eighteen
years
that
the
only
thing
that
is
said
to
him
should
be
you
sit
down
better
that
however
a
great
deal
than
you
go
away
he
sat
down
as
she
invited
him
with
a
short
laugh
he
was
perfectly
composed
in
manner
looking
round
him
with
curious
eyes
was
this
one
of
the
places
he
said
nell
that
we
stayed
in
in
the
old
times
she
answered
no
under
her
breath
her
paleness
suddenly
giving
way
to
a
hot
flush
of
feverish
agitation
and
then
she
took
refuge
in
a
vacant
chair
unable
to
support
herself
and
he
sat
too
and
the
party
looked
but
for
that
agitation
in
elinor
face
which
she
could
not
master
as
if
the
ladies
were
receiving
and
he
paying
a
morning
call
the
other
two
however
did
not
sit
down
young
philip
confused
and
excited
went
away
to
the
second
room
the
little
back
of
the
little
london
house
which
can
never
be
made
to
look
anything
but
an
anteroom
never
a
habitable
place
and
went
to
the
window
and
stood
there
as
if
he
were
looking
out
though
the
window
was
of
coloured
glass
and
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
dennistoun
stood
with
her
hand
upon
the
back
of
a
chair
her
heart
beating
too
and
yet
the
most
collected
of
them
all
waiting
with
her
eyes
on
elinor
for
a
sign
to
know
her
will
whether
she
should
go
or
stay
it
was
the
visitor
who
was
the
first
to
speak
let
me
beg
you
he
said
with
a
little
impatience
in
his
voice
to
sit
down
too
it
is
evident
that
nell
reception
of
me
is
not
likely
to
be
so
warm
as
to
make
it
unpleasant
for
a
third
party
there
was
a
fourth
party
in
the
room
a
minute
ago
if
my
eyes
did
not
deceive
me
ah
his
glance
went
rapidly
to
where
philip
tall
boyish
figure
with
his
back
turned
was
visible
against
the
further
window
that
all
right
he
said
now
i
presume
everybody
here
had
we
expected
your
visit
said
dennistoun
faltering
after
a
moment
as
elinor
did
not
speak
we
should
have
been
better
prepared
to
receive
you
mr
compton
that
not
spoken
with
your
usual
cleverness
he
said
with
a
laugh
you
used
to
be
a
great
deal
too
clever
for
me
you
and
nell
too
but
if
she
did
not
expect
to
see
me
i
do
know
what
she
thought
i
was
made
of
everything
that
is
bad
i
suppose
and
yet
you
know
i
could
have
worried
your
life
out
of
you
if
i
had
liked
nell
she
turned
to
him
for
the
first
time
and
putting
her
hands
together
said
almost
inaudibly
i
know
i
know
i
have
thought
of
that
and
i
am
not
ungrateful
grateful
well
perhaps
you
have
not
much
call
for
that
poor
little
woman
i
do
doubt
i
behaved
like
a
brute
and
you
were
quite
right
in
doing
what
you
did
but
you
taken
it
out
of
me
since
nell
all
the
same
then
there
was
again
a
silence
broken
only
by
the
labouring
which
she
could
not
quite
conceal
of
her
breath
you
would
believe
me
he
resumed
after
a
moment
if
i
were
to
set
up
a
sentimental
pose
like
a
sort
of
a
disconsolate
widower
eh
would
you
of
course
it
was
a
position
that
was
not
without
its
advantages
i
was
not
much
made
for
a
family
man
and
both
in
the
way
of
expense
and
in
other
ways
it
suited
me
well
enough
nobody
could
expect
me
to
marry
them
or
their
daughters
do
you
see
when
they
knew
i
had
a
wife
alive
so
i
was
allowed
my
little
amusements
you
never
went
in
for
that
kind
of
thing
nell
do
snap
me
up
you
know
i
told
you
i
never
was
against
a
little
flirtation
it
makes
a
woman
more
tolerant
in
my
opinion
just
to
know
how
to
amuse
herself
a
little
but
nell
was
never
one
of
that
kind
i
hope
not
indeed
said
dennistoun
to
whom
he
had
turned
with
indignation
i
do
see
where
the
emphasis
comes
in
she
was
one
that
a
man
could
be
as
sure
of
as
of
westminster
abbey
the
heart
of
her
husband
rests
upon
her
is
that
what
the
fellow
in
the
bible
says
or
words
to
that
effect
nell
was
always
a
kind
of
a
bible
to
me
and
you
may
say
that
in
that
case
to
think
of
her
amusing
herself
but
you
will
allow
she
always
did
take
everything
too
much
grand
no
to
be
sure
you
allow
nothing
but
still
that
was
the
truth
however
i
allow
something
if
you
wo
i
past
my
first
youth
oh
you
not
a
bit
of
it
you
just
as
fresh
and
as
pretty
by
george
as
ever
you
were
when
i
saw
you
stand
up
in
that
court
yesterday
looking
as
if
not
a
week
had
passed
since
i
saw
you
last
by
jove
nell
and
how
you
were
hating
it
poor
old
girl
and
had
come
out
straining
your
poor
little
conscience
and
saying
what
you
did
want
to
say
for
the
sake
of
a
worthless
fellow
like
me
a
sob
came
out
of
elinor
breast
and
something
half
inaudible
besides
like
a
name
i
can
tell
you
this
he
said
turning
to
dennistoun
again
i
could
look
at
her
i
an
unlikely
brute
for
that
sort
of
thing
but
if
i
had
looked
at
her
i
should
have
cried
i
daresay
you
do
believe
me
never
mind
but
it
true
i
do
believe
you
said
the
mother
very
low
thank
you
he
said
with
a
laugh
i
have
always
said
for
a
you
were
the
least
difficult
to
get
on
with
i
ever
saw
do
you
remember
giving
me
that
money
to
make
ducks
and
drakes
of
it
was
awfully
silly
of
you
you
did
deserve
to
be
trusted
with
money
to
throw
it
away
like
that
but
still
i
have
not
forgotten
it
well
i
came
to
thank
you
for
yesterday
nell
and
there
are
things
you
know
that
we
must
talk
over
you
never
gave
up
your
name
that
was
like
your
pluck
but
you
will
have
to
change
it
now
it
was
indecent
of
me
to
have
myself
announced
like
that
and
poor
old
serf
not
in
his
grave
yet
but
i
daresay
you
did
pay
any
attention
you
are
lady
serf
now
my
dear
you
do
mind
i
know
but
it
a
change
not
without
importance
well
who
is
that
fellow
behind
there
standing
in
the
window
i
think
you
ought
to
present
him
to
me
or
i
present
him
to
you
instead
i
saw
him
in
the
theatre
by
jove
with
that
fellow
tatham
that
cousin
john
of
yours
that
i
never
could
bear
smirking
and
smiling
at
him
as
if
it
were
son
but
saw
the
boy
then
for
the
first
time
nell
i
tell
you
there
are
some
things
in
which
you
have
taken
it
well
out
of
me
compton
she
said
labouring
to
speak
lord
serf
oh
phil
phil
ah
he
said
with
a
start
do
you
remember
at
last
the
garden
at
that
poky
old
cottage
with
all
the
flowers
and
the
days
when
you
looked
out
for
wild
phil
compton
that
all
the
world
warned
you
against
and
here
i
am
an
old
fogey
without
either
wife
or
child
and
tatham
taking
my
boy
about
and
nell
never
looking
me
in
the
face
philip
at
the
window
looking
out
at
nothing
through
the
glass
had
heard
every
word
with
wonder
with
horror
with
consternation
with
dreadful
disappointment
and
sinking
of
the
heart
for
indeed
he
had
a
high
ideal
of
a
father
the
highest
such
as
fatherless
boys
form
in
their
ignorance
and
every
word
made
it
more
sure
that
this
was
his
father
this
man
who
had
so
caught
his
eyes
and
filled
him
with
such
a
fever
of
interest
but
to
hear
phil
compton
talk
had
brought
the
boy
soaring
imagination
down
down
to
the
dust
he
had
not
been
prepared
for
anything
like
this
some
tragic
rending
asunder
he
could
have
believed
in
some
wild
and
strange
mystery
but
this
man
of
careless
speech
of
chaff
and
slang
so
little
noble
so
little
serious
so
far
from
tragic
the
disappointment
had
been
too
sudden
and
dreadful
to
leave
him
with
any
ears
for
those
tones
that
went
to
his
heart
he
had
no
pity
or
sense
of
the
pathos
that
was
in
them
he
stood
in
his
young
absolutism
disgusted
miserable
this
man
his
father
this
man
so
talking
so
thinking
young
philip
stood
with
his
back
to
the
group
more
miserable
than
words
could
say
he
heard
some
movement
behind
but
he
was
too
sick
of
heart
to
think
what
it
was
until
suddenly
he
felt
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
most
unwillingly
suffered
himself
to
be
turned
round
to
meet
his
father
eyes
he
gave
one
glance
up
at
the
face
which
he
did
not
now
feel
was
worn
with
study
and
care
which
now
that
he
saw
it
near
was
full
of
lines
and
wrinkles
which
meant
something
else
and
which
even
the
emotion
in
it
emotion
of
a
kind
which
pippo
did
not
understand
hidden
by
a
laugh
did
not
make
more
prepossessing
and
then
he
stood
with
his
eyes
cast
down
not
caring
to
see
it
again
the
elder
philip
compton
had
i
think
though
he
was
as
he
said
an
unlikely
subject
for
that
mood
tears
in
his
eyes
and
he
had
no
inclination
to
see
anything
that
was
painful
in
the
face
of
his
son
whose
look
he
had
never
read
whose
voice
he
had
never
heard
till
now
he
held
the
boy
with
his
hands
on
his
shoulders
with
a
grasp
more
full
perhaps
of
the
tender
strain
of
love
though
he
did
not
know
him
than
ever
he
had
laid
upon
any
human
form
before
the
boy
looks
were
not
only
satisfactory
to
him
but
filled
his
own
heart
with
an
unaccustomed
spring
of
pride
and
delight
his
stature
his
complexion
his
features
making
up
as
it
were
the
most
wonderful
compliment
the
utmost
sweetness
of
flattery
that
he
had
ever
known
for
the
boy
was
himself
over
again
not
like
his
mother
like
the
unworthy
father
whom
he
had
never
seen
it
took
him
some
time
to
master
the
sudden
rush
of
this
emotion
which
almost
overwhelmed
him
and
then
he
drew
the
boy
arm
through
his
own
and
led
him
back
to
where
the
two
ladies
sat
elinor
still
too
much
agitated
for
speech
i
said
i
present
my
son
to
you
nell
if
you
would
present
him
to
me
he
said
with
a
break
in
his
voice
which
sounded
like
a
chuckle
to
that
son
angry
ears
i
do
know
what
you
call
the
fellow
but
he
big
enough
to
have
a
name
of
his
own
and
lomond
from
this
day
pippo
did
not
know
what
was
meant
by
those
words
but
he
drew
his
arm
from
his
father
and
went
and
stood
behind
elinor
chair
forgetting
in
a
moment
all
grievances
against
her
taking
her
side
with
an
energy
impossible
to
put
into
words
clinging
to
his
mother
as
he
had
done
when
he
was
a
little
child
chapter
xlviii
it
was
while
this
conversation
was
going
on
that
john
tatham
anxious
and
troubled
about
many
things
knocked
at
the
door
in
ebury
street
he
was
anxious
to
know
how
the
explanations
had
got
accomplished
how
the
boy
took
it
how
elinor
had
borne
the
strain
upon
her
of
such
a
revelation
well
as
he
knew
elinor
he
still
thought
as
is
generally
thought
in
circumstances
so
painful
that
a
great
crisis
a
great
mental
effort
would
make
her
ill
he
wanted
to
know
how
she
was
he
wanted
to
know
how
pippo
had
borne
it
what
the
boy
thought
it
had
glanced
across
him
that
young
philip
might
be
excited
by
so
wonderful
a
new
thing
and
form
some
false
impression
of
his
father
whom
doubtless
she
would
represent
under
the
best
light
taking
blame
upon
herself
not
to
destroy
the
boy
ideal
and
be
eager
to
know
him
which
was
a
thing
john
felt
which
would
be
very
difficult
to
bear
the
door
was
opened
to
him
not
by
good
jones
the
kind
landlady
but
by
the
magnificent
jones
himself
who
rarely
appeared
john
said
mrs
compton
as
a
matter
of
course
and
was
about
to
pass
in
in
his
usual
familiar
way
but
something
in
the
man
air
made
him
pause
he
looked
at
jones
again
who
was
bursting
with
importance
perhaps
engaged
he
said
i
think
sir
said
john
that
her
ladyship
is
engaged
his
lordship
is
with
her
ladyship
his
what
john
tatham
cried
his
lordship
tatham
i
know
sir
as
the
title
is
not
usually
assumed
till
after
the
funeral
but
in
the
very
where
her
ladyship
is
residing
for
the
moment
there
allowances
to
be
made
naturally
we
a
little
excited
over
it
being
if
i
may
make
so
bold
as
to
say
so
a
sort
of
friends
and
long
patronized
by
her
ladyship
and
young
lord
lomond
too
young
lord
lomond
too
john
tatham
stood
for
a
moment
and
stared
at
jones
and
then
he
laughed
out
and
turned
his
back
and
walked
away
young
lord
lomond
too
the
boy
who
had
been
more
like
john
boy
than
anything
else
but
now
tricked
out
in
a
new
name
a
new
position
his
father
heir
oh
yes
it
was
john
himself
who
had
insisted
on
that
only
a
few
days
ago
the
heir
to
a
peerage
ca
be
hid
it
was
he
that
had
quoted
this
as
an
aphorism
worthy
of
a
social
sage
but
when
the
moment
came
and
the
boy
was
taken
from
him
and
introduced
into
that
other
sphere
by
the
side
of
that
man
who
had
once
been
the
phil
good
heavens
what
changes
life
is
capable
of
what
wrongs
what
cruelties
what
what
twists
and
alterations
of
every
sane
thought
and
thing
john
tatham
was
a
sensible
man
as
well
as
an
eminent
lawyer
and
knew
that
between
elinor
son
who
was
phil
compton
son
and
himself
there
was
no
external
link
at
all
nothing
but
affection
and
habit
and
the
link
that
had
been
twisted
closer
and
closer
with
the
progress
of
these
years
but
nothing
real
the
merest
shadow
of
relationship
a
cousin
who
could
count
how
often
removed
and
it
was
he
who
had
insisted
forced
upon
elinor
the
necessity
of
making
his
father
known
to
philip
of
informing
him
of
his
real
position
nobody
had
interfered
in
this
respect
but
john
he
had
made
himself
a
weariness
to
her
by
insisting
never
giving
over
blaming
her
hourly
for
her
delay
and
yet
now
when
the
thing
he
had
so
worked
for
so
constantly
urged
was
done
he
smiled
grimly
to
himself
as
he
walked
away
they
were
all
together
the
lordship
and
the
ladyship
young
lord
lomond
too
and
phil
compton
whitewashed
a
peer
of
the
realm
and
still
the
scoundrel
a
handsome
fellow
enough
with
an
air
about
him
a
man
who
might
still
dazzle
a
youngster
unaccustomed
to
the
world
he
had
the
bosom
of
his
family
and
doubtless
was
weeping
upon
philip
neck
and
bandying
about
that
name
of
nell
which
had
always
seemed
to
john
an
insult
an
insult
to
himself
and
in
that
moment
of
bitterness
john
did
not
know
how
she
would
take
it
what
effect
it
would
produce
upon
her
perhaps
the
very
sight
of
the
fellow
who
had
once
won
her
heart
the
lover
of
her
youth
with
whom
john
had
never
for
a
moment
put
himself
in
competition
notwithstanding
the
bitter
wonder
in
his
heart
that
elinor
elinor
of
all
people
could
ever
have
loved
such
a
man
yet
she
had
loved
him
and
the
sight
of
him
again
after
so
many
years
what
effect
might
it
not
produce
as
he
walked
away
it
was
the
idea
of
a
happy
family
that
came
into
john
tatham
mind
mutual
forgiveness
mutual
return
to
the
old
traditions
which
are
the
most
endearing
of
all
expansions
confessions
recollections
and
lives
of
reunion
something
more
than
a
prodigal
return
the
return
of
a
sinner
bringing
a
coronet
in
his
hand
bringing
distinction
a
place
and
position
enough
to
dazzle
any
boy
enough
to
make
a
woman
forgive
and
was
not
this
what
john
wished
above
all
things
every
advancement
for
the
boy
and
an
assured
place
in
the
world
as
well
as
every
happiness
that
might
be
possible
happiness
yet
it
was
possible
she
might
think
it
so
for
elinor
yes
this
was
what
he
had
wished
for
been
ready
to
make
any
sacrifice
to
secure
in
the
sudden
shock
tatham
thought
of
the
only
other
person
who
perhaps
yet
only
perhaps
might
feel
a
little
as
he
did
the
mother
dennistoun
upon
whom
he
thought
all
this
would
come
like
a
not
knowing
that
she
was
in
the
family
party
among
the
lordships
and
the
ladyship
too
he
went
home
and
into
his
handsome
library
and
shut
the
door
upon
himself
to
have
it
out
there
or
rather
to
occupy
himself
in
some
more
sensible
way
and
shut
this
foolish
subject
out
of
his
mind
it
occurred
to
him
however
when
he
sat
down
that
the
best
thing
to
do
would
be
to
write
an
account
of
it
all
to
dennistoun
who
doubtless
in
the
excitement
would
have
a
long
time
to
wait
for
news
of
this
great
change
he
drew
his
towards
him
with
this
object
and
opened
it
and
dipped
his
pen
in
the
ink
and
wrote
my
dear
aunt
but
he
did
not
get
much
further
he
raised
his
head
thinking
how
to
introduce
his
narrative
for
which
she
would
in
all
likelihood
be
wholly
unprepared
and
in
so
doing
looked
round
upon
his
on
one
shelf
of
which
the
reflection
of
a
ray
of
afternoon
sunshine
caught
in
the
old
louis
treize
mirror
over
the
mantelpiece
was
throwing
a
shaft
of
light
he
got
up
to
make
sure
that
it
was
only
a
reflection
nothing
that
would
harm
the
binding
of
a
particular
volume
upon
which
he
set
great
store
though
of
course
he
knew
very
well
that
it
could
only
be
a
reflection
no
impertinent
reality
of
sunshine
being
permitted
to
penetrate
there
and
then
he
paused
a
little
to
draw
his
hand
lovingly
over
the
line
of
choice
books
very
choice
worth
a
little
fortune
which
he
laughed
at
himself
a
little
for
being
proud
of
fully
knowing
that
what
was
inside
them
which
generally
is
the
cream
of
a
book
as
of
a
letter
according
to
tony
lumpkin
was
in
many
cases
worth
nothing
at
all
and
then
john
went
and
stood
upon
the
and
looked
round
him
upon
this
the
heart
of
his
domain
it
was
a
noble
library
any
man
might
have
been
proud
of
it
he
asked
himself
whether
it
did
not
suit
him
better
with
all
the
comforts
and
luxuries
beyond
it
than
if
he
had
been
like
other
men
with
an
entirely
different
centre
of
life
in
the
empty
and
the
burden
upon
him
of
setting
out
children
boys
and
girls
upon
the
world
when
a
man
asks
himself
this
question
however
complacent
may
be
the
reply
it
betrays
perhaps
a
doubt
whether
the
assurance
he
has
is
so
very
sure
after
all
and
he
returned
to
his
letter
to
dennistoun
which
would
be
quite
easy
to
write
if
it
were
only
once
well
begun
but
he
had
not
written
above
a
few
words
having
spent
some
time
in
his
previous
reflections
when
he
paused
again
at
the
sound
of
a
tumultuous
summons
at
the
as
may
be
well
supposed
his
servant
took
more
time
than
usual
to
answer
it
resenting
a
noise
so
out
of
character
with
the
house
during
which
john
listened
fearing
yet
wishing
for
a
diversion
and
then
his
own
door
burst
open
not
i
need
not
say
by
any
intervention
of
legitimate
hands
but
by
the
sudden
rush
of
philip
who
seemed
to
come
in
in
a
whirl
of
long
limbs
and
eager
eyes
flinging
himself
into
a
chair
and
fixing
his
gaze
across
the
corner
of
the
table
upon
his
astonished
yet
expectant
friend
oh
uncle
john
the
boy
cried
and
had
not
breath
to
say
any
more
john
put
forth
his
hand
across
the
table
and
grasped
the
young
flexible
warm
hand
that
wanted
something
to
hold
well
my
boy
he
said
i
suppose
you
know
said
philip
i
have
nothing
to
tell
you
though
it
is
all
so
strange
to
me
i
know
nothing
about
what
interests
me
most
at
present
yourself
pippo
and
what
has
happened
to
you
john
had
always
made
a
great
stand
against
that
particular
name
but
several
times
had
used
it
of
late
not
knowing
why
i
do
know
what
you
thought
of
me
last
night
said
the
boy
i
was
so
miserable
may
i
tell
you
everything
uncle
john
what
balm
that
question
was
he
clasped
pippo
hand
in
his
own
but
scarcely
could
answer
to
bid
him
go
on
it
was
unnecessary
all
she
wanted
to
tell
me
i
fought
it
off
all
the
morning
i
was
there
yesterday
in
the
court
and
heard
it
all
in
the
court
at
the
trial
i
had
no
meaning
in
it
said
philip
i
went
by
chance
as
people
say
because
the
marshalls
had
not
turned
up
i
got
simmons
to
get
me
into
the
court
i
had
always
wanted
to
see
a
trial
and
there
i
saw
my
mother
stand
up
my
mother
that
i
never
could
bear
the
wind
to
blow
on
standing
up
there
alone
with
all
these
people
staring
at
her
to
be
tried
for
her
life
do
be
a
fool
philip
said
john
tatham
dropping
his
hand
tried
she
was
only
a
witness
and
she
was
not
alone
i
was
there
to
take
care
of
her
i
saw
you
but
what
was
that
she
was
alone
all
the
same
and
for
me
it
was
she
who
was
on
her
trial
what
did
i
know
about
any
other
i
heard
it
every
word
poor
boy
so
what
was
the
use
of
making
herself
miserable
to
tell
me
she
tried
to
all
this
morning
and
i
fought
it
off
i
was
miserable
enough
why
should
i
be
made
more
miserable
to
hear
her
perhaps
excusing
herself
to
me
but
at
last
she
had
driven
me
into
a
corner
angry
as
i
was
uncle
john
i
was
angry
furious
with
my
mother
fancy
with
my
mother
john
did
not
say
anything
but
he
nodded
his
head
in
assent
how
well
he
understood
it
all
and
just
then
at
that
moment
he
came
i
am
angry
with
her
no
more
i
know
whatever
happened
she
was
right
angry
with
her
my
poor
dear
dearest
mother
whatever
happened
she
was
right
it
was
best
that
she
should
not
tell
me
i
am
on
her
side
all
through
all
through
do
you
hear
me
uncle
john
i
have
seen
you
look
as
if
you
blamed
her
again
while
i
am
there
whatever
she
has
done
it
has
been
the
right
thing
all
through
pippo
said
john
with
a
little
quivering
about
the
mouth
give
me
your
hand
again
old
fellow
you
my
own
boy
nobody
shall
so
much
as
look
as
if
they
blamed
her
cried
the
boy
while
i
am
alive
oh
how
near
he
was
to
crying
and
how
resolute
not
to
break
down
though
something
got
into
his
throat
and
almost
choked
him
and
his
eyes
were
so
full
that
it
was
a
miracle
they
did
not
brim
over
excitement
distress
pain
the
first
touch
of
human
misery
he
had
ever
known
almost
overmastered
philip
he
got
up
and
walked
about
the
room
and
talked
and
talked
he
who
had
never
concealed
anything
who
had
never
had
anything
to
conceal
and
for
hours
he
had
been
silent
with
a
great
secret
upon
his
soul
john
was
too
wise
to
check
the
outpouring
he
listened
to
everything
assented
soothed
imperceptibly
led
him
to
gentler
thoughts
and
what
does
he
mean
cried
the
boy
at
last
with
his
new
name
i
shall
have
no
name
but
my
own
the
one
my
mother
gave
me
i
am
philip
compton
and
nothing
else
what
right
has
he
the
first
time
he
ever
saw
me
to
put
upon
me
another
name
what
name
he
called
me
lomond
or
something
like
that
said
young
philip
and
then
there
came
a
sort
of
stillness
over
his
excitement
a
lull
in
the
storm
some
vague
idea
what
it
meant
came
all
at
once
into
the
mind
and
a
thrill
of
curiosity
of
another
kind
of
excitement
of
rising
thoughts
which
he
did
not
hardly
understand
struggled
up
through
the
other
zone
of
passion
he
was
half
ashamed
having
just
poured
forth
all
his
feelings
to
show
that
there
was
something
else
something
that
was
no
longer
indignation
nor
anger
nor
the
shock
of
discovery
something
that
had
a
tremor
perhaps
of
pleasure
in
it
behind
but
john
was
far
too
experienced
a
man
not
to
read
the
boy
through
and
through
he
liked
him
better
in
the
first
phase
but
this
was
natural
too
it
happens
very
strangely
he
said
that
all
these
things
should
come
upon
you
at
once
but
it
is
well
you
should
know
now
all
about
it
lomond
is
the
second
title
of
the
comptons
earls
of
serf
have
i
heard
you
ask
what
comptons
you
belonged
to
philip
it
has
all
happened
within
a
day
or
two
your
father
was
only
philip
compton
yesterday
at
the
trial
and
a
poor
man
now
he
is
lord
serf
if
not
rich
at
least
no
longer
poor
everything
has
changed
for
you
your
position
your
importance
in
the
world
the
last
lord
lomond
bore
the
name
creditably
enough
i
hope
you
will
make
it
shine
he
took
the
boy
by
the
hand
and
grasped
it
heartily
again
i
am
thankful
for
it
said
john
i
would
rather
you
were
lord
lomond
than
what
uncle
john
steady
boy
i
was
going
to
say
philip
compton
son
but
lord
serf
is
another
man
there
was
a
long
pause
in
the
room
where
john
tatham
life
was
centred
among
his
books
he
had
so
much
to
do
with
all
this
business
and
yet
so
little
it
would
pass
away
with
all
its
tumults
and
he
after
being
absorbed
by
it
for
a
moment
would
be
left
alone
to
his
own
thoughts
and
his
own
unbroken
line
of
existence
so
much
the
better
it
is
not
good
for
any
man
to
be
swept
up
and
put
down
again
at
the
will
of
others
in
matters
in
which
he
has
no
share
as
for
philip
he
was
silent
chiefly
to
realise
this
great
thing
that
had
come
upon
him
he
lord
lomond
a
peer
son
who
was
only
pippo
of
lakeside
like
any
other
lad
in
the
parish
and
not
half
so
important
at
school
as
musgrave
who
did
not
get
that
scholarship
what
the
school
would
say
the
tempest
that
would
arise
they
would
ask
a
holiday
and
the
head
master
would
grant
it
compton
a
lord
philip
could
hear
the
roar
and
rustle
among
the
boys
the
scornful
incredulity
the
asseverations
of
those
who
knew
it
was
true
and
a
flush
that
was
pleasure
had
come
over
his
musing
face
it
would
have
been
strange
if
in
the
wonder
of
it
there
had
not
been
some
pleasure
too
he
had
begun
to
tolerate
his
father
before
many
days
were
over
to
cease
to
be
indignant
and
angry
that
he
was
not
the
ideal
father
of
his
dreams
that
was
not
lord
serf
fault
who
was
not
at
all
aware
of
his
son
dreams
and
had
never
had
an
ideal
in
his
life
but
john
tatham
was
right
in
saying
that
lord
serf
was
another
man
the
shock
of
a
new
responsibility
of
a
position
to
occupy
and
duties
to
fulfil
were
things
that
might
not
have
much
moved
the
phil
two
years
before
but
he
was
fifty
and
beginning
to
feel
himself
an
old
fogey
as
he
confessed
and
his
son
overawed
lord
serf
his
son
who
was
so
like
him
yet
had
the
mother
quick
impetuous
eyes
so
rapid
to
see
through
everything
so
disdainful
of
folly
so
keen
in
perception
he
was
afraid
to
bring
upon
himself
one
of
those
lightning
flashes
from
the
eyes
of
his
boy
and
doubly
afraid
to
introduce
his
son
anywhere
to
show
him
anything
that
might
bring
upon
him
the
reproach
of
doing
harm
to
pippo
his
house
which
had
been
very
decent
and
orderly
in
the
late
lord
serf
time
became
almost
prim
in
the
terror
phil
had
lest
they
should
say
that
it
was
bad
for
the
boy
as
for
lady
serf
it
was
popularly
reported
that
the
reason
why
she
almost
invariably
lived
in
the
country
was
her
health
which
kept
her
out
of
society
a
report
i
need
not
say
absolutely
rejected
by
society
itself
which
knew
all
the
circumstances
better
than
you
or
i
do
but
which
sufficed
for
the
outsiders
who
knew
nothing
when
elinor
did
appear
upon
great
occasions
which
she
consented
to
do
her
matured
beauty
gave
the
fullest
contradiction
to
the
pretext
on
which
she
continued
to
live
her
own
life
but
old
lord
serf
who
got
old
so
long
before
he
need
to
have
done
with
perhaps
the
same
sort
of
constitutional
weakness
which
had
carried
off
all
his
brothers
before
their
time
or
perhaps
because
he
had
too
much
abused
a
constitution
which
was
not
weak
grew
more
and
more
fond
in
his
latter
days
of
the
country
too
and
kept
appearing
at
lakeside
so
often
that
at
last
the
ladies
removed
much
nearer
town
to
the
of
the
serfs
which
had
not
been
occupied
for
ages
where
they
presented
at
last
the
appearance
of
a
united
family
and
where
lomond
who
would
have
thought
it
very
strange
now
to
be
addressed
by
any
other
name
brought
his
friends
and
was
not
to
hear
his
father
discourse
in
a
way
which
sometimes
still
offended
the
pippo
but
which
the
other
young
men
found
very
amusing
it
was
not
in
the
way
of
morals
however
that
lord
serf
ever
offended
the
fear
of
elinor
kept
him
as
blameless
as
any
preacher
of
the
endless
theme
that
all
is
vanity
could
do
these
family
arrangements
however
and
the
modified
happiness
obtained
by
their
means
were
still
all
in
the
future
when
john
tatham
a
little
afraid
of
the
encounter
yet
anxious
to
have
it
over
went
to
ebury
street
the
day
after
these
occurrences
to
see
elinor
for
the
first
time
under
her
new
character
as
lady
serf
he
found
her
in
a
languor
and
exhaustion
much
unlike
elinor
doing
nothing
not
even
a
book
near
lying
back
in
her
chair
fallen
upon
herself
as
the
french
say
some
of
those
words
that
mean
nothing
passed
between
them
and
then
she
said
john
did
pippo
tell
you
that
he
had
been
there
he
nodded
his
head
finding
nothing
to
say
without
any
warning
to
see
his
mother
stand
up
before
all
the
world
to
be
tried
for
her
life
elinor
said
john
you
are
as
fantastic
as
the
boy
i
was
being
tried
for
my
life
before
him
as
the
judge
and
he
has
acquitted
me
but
oh
i
wonder
i
wonder
if
he
would
have
done
so
had
he
known
all
that
i
know
i
do
so
said
john
perhaps
a
little
more
used
to
the
laws
of
evidence
than
pippo
ah
you
she
said
giving
him
her
hand
with
a
look
which
john
did
not
know
how
to
take
whether
as
the
fullest
expression
of
trust
or
an
affectionate
disdain
of
the
man
in
whose
partial
judgment
no
justice
was
and
then
she
asked
a
question
which
threw
perhaps
the
greatest
perplexity
he
had
ever
known
into
john
tatham
life
when
you
tell
a
fact
that
is
true
with
the
intention
to
deceive
john
you
that
know
the
laws
