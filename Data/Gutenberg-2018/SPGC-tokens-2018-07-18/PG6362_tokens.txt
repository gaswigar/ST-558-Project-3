part
one
making
the
mould
i
the
company
stood
at
attention
each
man
looking
straight
before
him
at
the
empty
parade
ground
where
the
cinder
piles
showed
purple
with
evening
on
the
wind
that
smelt
of
barracks
and
disinfectant
there
was
a
faint
greasiness
of
food
cooking
at
the
other
side
of
the
wide
field
long
lines
of
men
shuffled
slowly
into
the
narrow
wooden
shanty
that
was
the
mess
hall
chins
down
chests
out
legs
twitching
and
tired
from
the
afternoon
drilling
the
company
stood
at
attention
each
man
stared
straight
in
front
of
him
some
vacantly
with
resignation
some
trying
to
amuse
themselves
by
noting
minutely
every
object
in
their
field
of
vision
the
cinder
piles
the
long
shadows
of
the
barracks
and
mess
halls
where
they
could
see
men
standing
about
spitting
smoking
leaning
against
clapboard
walls
some
of
the
men
in
line
could
hear
their
watches
ticking
in
their
pockets
someone
moved
his
feet
making
a
crunching
noise
in
the
cinders
the
sergeant
voice
snarled
out
you
men
are
at
attention
quit
yer
wrigglin
there
you
the
men
nearest
the
offender
looked
at
him
out
of
the
corners
of
their
eyes
two
officers
far
out
on
the
parade
ground
were
coming
towards
them
by
their
gestures
and
the
way
they
walked
the
men
at
attention
could
see
that
they
were
chatting
about
something
that
amused
them
one
of
the
officers
laughed
boyishly
turned
away
and
walked
slowly
back
across
the
parade
ground
the
other
who
was
the
lieutenant
came
towards
them
smiling
as
he
approached
his
company
the
smile
left
his
lips
and
he
advanced
his
chin
walking
with
heavy
precise
steps
sergeant
you
may
dismiss
the
the
lieutenant
voice
was
pitched
in
a
hard
staccato
the
sergeant
hand
snapped
up
to
salute
like
a
block
signal
companee
dis
missed
he
rang
out
the
row
of
men
in
khaki
became
a
crowd
of
various
individuals
with
dusty
boots
and
dusty
faces
ten
minutes
later
they
lined
up
and
marched
in
a
column
of
fours
to
mess
a
few
red
filaments
of
electric
lights
gave
a
dusty
glow
in
the
brownish
obscurity
where
the
long
tables
and
benches
and
the
board
floors
had
a
faint
smell
of
garbage
mingled
with
the
smell
of
the
disinfectant
the
tables
had
been
washed
off
with
after
the
last
meal
the
men
holding
their
oval
mess
kits
in
front
of
them
filed
by
the
great
tin
buckets
at
the
door
out
of
which
meat
and
potatoes
were
splashed
into
each
plate
by
a
sweating
in
blue
denims
do
look
so
bad
tonight
said
fuselli
to
the
man
opposite
him
as
he
hitched
his
sleeves
up
at
the
wrists
and
leaned
over
his
steaming
food
he
was
sturdy
with
curly
hair
and
full
vigorous
lips
that
he
smacked
hungrily
as
he
ate
it
ai
said
the
pink
youth
opposite
him
who
wore
his
hat
on
the
side
of
his
head
with
a
certain
jauntiness
i
got
a
pass
tonight
said
fuselli
tilting
his
head
vainly
goin
to
tear
things
up
man
i
got
a
girl
at
home
back
in
frisco
she
a
good
yer
right
not
to
go
with
any
of
the
girls
in
this
goddam
town
they
ai
clean
none
of
that
is
if
ye
want
to
go
the
youth
leaned
across
the
table
earnestly
i
goin
to
git
some
more
chow
wait
for
me
will
yer
said
fuselli
what
yer
going
to
do
down
town
asked
the
youth
when
fuselli
came
back
dunno
run
round
a
bit
an
go
to
the
movies
he
answered
filling
his
mouth
with
potato
gawd
it
time
fer
they
overheard
a
voice
behind
them
fuselli
stuffed
his
mouth
as
full
as
he
could
and
emptied
the
rest
of
his
meal
reluctantly
into
the
garbage
pail
a
few
moments
later
he
stood
stiffly
at
attention
in
a
khaki
row
that
was
one
of
hundreds
of
other
khaki
rows
identical
that
filled
all
sides
of
the
parade
ground
while
the
bugle
blew
somewhere
at
the
other
end
where
the
was
somehow
it
made
him
think
of
the
man
behind
the
desk
in
the
office
of
the
draft
board
who
had
said
handing
him
the
papers
sending
him
to
camp
i
wish
i
was
going
with
you
and
had
held
out
a
white
bony
hand
that
fuselli
after
a
moment
hesitation
had
taken
in
his
own
stubby
brown
hand
the
man
had
added
fervently
it
must
be
grand
just
grand
to
feel
the
danger
the
chance
of
being
potted
any
minute
good
luck
young
feller
good
fuselli
remembered
unpleasantly
his
face
and
the
greenish
look
of
his
bald
head
but
the
words
had
made
him
stride
out
of
the
office
sticking
out
his
chest
brushing
truculently
past
a
group
of
men
in
the
door
even
now
the
memory
of
it
mixing
with
the
strains
of
the
national
anthem
made
him
feel
important
truculent
squads
right
came
an
order
crunch
crunch
crunch
in
the
gravel
the
companies
were
going
back
to
their
barracks
he
wanted
to
smile
but
he
did
dare
he
wanted
to
smile
because
he
had
a
pass
till
midnight
because
in
ten
minutes
he
be
outside
the
gates
outside
the
green
fence
and
the
sentries
and
the
strands
of
barbed
wire
crunch
crunch
crunch
oh
they
were
so
slow
in
getting
back
to
the
barracks
and
he
was
losing
time
precious
free
minutes
hep
hep
hep
cried
the
sergeant
glaring
down
the
ranks
with
his
aggressive
bulldog
expression
to
where
someone
had
fallen
out
of
step
the
company
stood
at
attention
in
the
dusk
fuselli
was
biting
the
inside
of
his
lips
with
impatience
minutes
at
last
as
if
reluctantly
the
sergeant
sang
out
dis
fuselli
hurried
towards
the
gate
brandishing
his
pass
with
an
important
swagger
once
out
on
the
asphalt
of
the
street
he
looked
down
the
long
row
of
lawns
and
porches
where
violet
arc
lamps
already
contested
the
faint
afterglow
drooping
from
their
iron
stalks
far
above
the
recently
planted
saplings
of
the
avenue
he
stood
at
the
corner
slouched
against
a
telegraph
pole
with
the
camp
fence
surmounted
by
three
strands
of
barbed
wire
behind
him
wondering
which
way
he
would
go
this
was
a
hell
of
a
town
anyway
and
he
used
to
think
he
wanted
to
travel
round
and
see
home
be
good
enough
for
me
after
this
he
muttered
walking
down
the
long
street
towards
the
centre
of
town
where
was
the
show
he
thought
of
his
home
of
the
dark
apartment
on
the
ground
floor
of
a
house
where
his
aunt
lived
gee
she
used
to
cook
swell
he
murmured
regretfully
on
a
warm
evening
like
this
he
would
have
stood
round
at
the
corner
where
the
drugstore
was
talking
to
fellows
he
knew
giggling
when
the
girls
who
lived
in
the
street
walking
arm
and
arm
twined
in
couples
or
trios
passed
by
affecting
ignorance
of
the
glances
that
followed
them
or
perhaps
he
would
have
gone
walking
with
al
who
worked
in
the
same
store
down
through
the
glaring
streets
of
the
theatre
and
restaurant
quarter
or
along
the
wharves
and
ferry
slips
where
they
would
have
sat
smoking
and
looking
out
over
the
dark
purple
harbor
with
its
winking
lights
and
its
moving
ferries
spilling
swaying
reflections
in
the
water
out
of
their
square
windows
if
they
had
been
lucky
they
would
have
seen
a
liner
come
in
through
the
golden
gate
growing
from
a
blur
of
light
to
a
huge
moving
brilliance
like
the
front
of
a
theatre
that
towered
above
the
ferry
boats
you
could
often
hear
the
thump
of
the
screw
and
the
swish
of
the
bow
cutting
the
calm
baywater
and
the
sound
of
a
band
playing
that
came
alternately
faint
and
loud
when
i
git
rich
fuselli
had
liked
to
say
to
al

all
over

face
so
that

noticeable
even
under
the
ashen
glare
of
the
arc
lights
on
the
avenue
that

flag
in

winder
that

dan
an
she
had
it
all
the
time
without
my
knowin
it
ai
girls
clever
yare
said
the
tall
youth
vaguely
along
the
rows
of
cots
when
fuselli
got
back
to
the
barracks
men
were
talking
excitedly
there
hell
to
pay
somebody
broke
out
of
the
how
damned
if
i
sergeant
timmons
said
he
made
a
rope
of
his
no
the
feller
on
guard
helped
him
to
get
like
hell
he
did
it
was
like
this
i
was
walking
by
the
guardhouse
when
they
found
out
about
what
company
did
he
belong
ter
what
his
name
some
guy
on
trial
for
insubordination
punched
an
officer
in
the
i
a
liked
to
have
seen
anyhow
he
fixed
himself
this
you
goddam
will
you
fellers
quit
talkin
it
after
taps
thundered
the
sergeant
who
sat
reading
the
paper
at
a
little
board
desk
at
the
door
of
the
barracks
under
the
feeble
light
of
one
small
bulb
carefully
screened
you
have
the
down
on
fuselli
wrapped
the
blanket
round
his
head
and
prepared
to
sleep
snuggled
down
into
the
blankets
on
the
narrow
cot
he
felt
sheltered
from
the
sergeant
thundering
voice
and
from
the
cold
glare
of
officers
eyes
he
felt
cosy
and
happy
like
he
had
felt
in
bed
at
home
when
he
had
been
a
little
kid
for
a
moment
he
pictured
to
himself
the
other
man
the
man
who
had
punched
an
officer
jaw
dressed
like
he
was
maybe
only
nineteen
the
same
age
like
he
was
with
a
girl
like
mabe
waiting
for
him
somewhere
how
cold
and
frightful
it
must
feel
to
be
out
of
the
camp
with
the
guard
looking
for
you
he
pictured
himself
running
breathless
down
a
long
street
pursued
by
a
company
with
guns
by
officers
whose
eyes
glinted
cruelly
like
the
pointed
tips
of
bullets
he
pulled
the
blanket
closer
round
his
head
enjoying
the
warmth
and
softness
of
the
wool
against
his
cheek
he
must
remember
to
smile
at
the
sergeant
when
he
passed
him
off
duty
somebody
had
said
there
be
promotions
soon
oh
he
wanted
so
hard
to
be
promoted
it
be
so
swell
if
he
could
write
back
to
mabe
and
tell
her
to
address
her
letters
corporal
dan
fuselli
he
must
be
more
careful
not
to
do
anything
that
would
get
him
in
wrong
with
anybody
he
must
never
miss
an
opportunity
to
show
them
what
a
clever
kid
he
was
oh
when
we
ordered
overseas
i
show
them
he
thought
ardently
and
picturing
to
himself
long
movie
reels
of
heroism
he
went
off
to
sleep
a
sharp
voice
beside
his
cot
woke
him
with
a
jerk
get
up
the
white
beam
of
a
pocket
searchlight
was
glaring
in
the
face
of
the
man
next
to
him
the
said
fuselli
to
himself
get
up
you
came
the
sharp
voice
again
the
man
in
the
next
cot
stirred
and
opened
his
eyes
get
here
sir
muttered
the
man
in
the
next
cot
his
eyes
blinking
sleepily
in
the
glare
of
the
flashlight
he
got
out
of
bed
and
stood
unsteadily
at
attention
do
you
know
better
than
to
sleep
in
your
shirt
take
it
yes
what
your
name
the
man
looked
up
blinking
too
dazed
to
speak
do
know
your
own
name
eh
said
the
officer
glaring
at
the
man
savagely
using
his
curt
voice
like
a
quick
take
off
yer
shirt
and
pants
and
get
back
to
the
officer
of
the
day
moved
on
flashing
his
light
to
one
side
and
the
other
in
his
midnight
inspection
of
the
barracks
intense
blackness
again
and
the
sound
of
men
breathing
deeply
in
sleep
of
men
snoring
as
he
went
to
sleep
fuselli
could
hear
the
man
beside
him
swearing
monotonously
in
an
even
whisper
pausing
now
and
then
to
think
of
new
filth
of
new
combinations
of
words
swearing
away
his
helpless
anger
soothing
himself
to
sleep
by
the
monotonous
reiteration
of
his
swearing
a
little
later
fuselli
woke
with
a
choked
nightmare
cry
he
had
dreamed
that
he
had
smashed
the
in
the
jaw
and
had
broken
out
of
the
jug
and
was
running
breathless
stumbling
falling
while
the
company
on
guard
chased
him
down
an
avenue
lined
with
little
saplings
gaining
on
him
while
with
voices
metallic
as
the
clicking
of
rifle
triggers
officers
shouted
orders
so
that
he
was
certain
to
be
caught
certain
to
be
shot
he
shook
himself
all
over
shaking
off
the
nightmare
as
a
dog
shakes
off
water
and
went
back
to
sleep
again
snuggling
into
his
blankets
ii
john
andrews
stood
naked
in
the
center
of
a
large
bare
room
of
which
the
walls
and
ceiling
and
floor
were
made
of
raw
pine
boards
the
air
was
heavy
from
the
steam

at
a
desk
in
one
corner
a
typewriter
clicked
spasmodically

added

on

without

john
andrews
stood
in
the
center
of
the
floor
with
his
arms
folded
half
amused
half
angry
shifting
his
weight
from
one
foot
to
the
other
listening
to
the
sound
of
the
typewriter
and
of
the

read

the

followed
the
recruiting
sergeant
to
a
desk
in
the
far
corner
of
the
room
from
which
he
could
hear
more
faintly
the
click
click
of
the
typewriter
and
the

mumbling
angrily

all

take

to
barracks
b
fourth
building
to
the
right
shake
a
leg
said
the
recruiting
sergeant
andrews
drew
a
deep
breath
of
the
sparkling
air
outside
he
stood
irresolutely
a
moment
on
the
wooden
steps
of
the
building
looking
down
the
row
of
hastily
constructed
barracks
some
were
painted
green
some
were
of
plain
boards
and
some
were
still
mere
skeletons
above
his
head
great
piled
clouds
were
moving
slowly
across
the
immeasurable
free
sky
his
glance
slid
down
the
sky
to
some
tall
trees
that
flamed
bright
yellow
with
autumn
outside
the
camp
limits
and
then
to
the
end
of
the
long
street
of
barracks
where
was
a
picket
fence
and
a
sentry
walking
to
and
fro
to
and
fro
his
brows
contracted
for
a
moment
then
he
walked
with
a
sort
of
swagger
towards
the
fourth
building
to
the
right
john
andrews
was
washing
windows
he
stood
in
dirty
blue
denims
at
the
top
of
a
ladder
smearing
with
a
soapy
cloth
the
small
panes
of
the
barrack
windows
his
nostrils
were
full
of
a
smell
of
dust
and
of
the
sandy
quality
of
the
soap
a
little
man
with
one
lined
cheek
puffed
out
by
tobacco
followed
him
up
also
on
a
ladder
polishing
the
panes
with
a
dry
cloth
till
they
shone
and
reflected
the
mottled
cloudy
sky
andrews
legs
were
tired
from
climbing
up
and
down
the
ladder
his
hands
were
sore
from
the
grittiness
of
the
soap
as
he
worked
he
looked
down
without
thinking
on
rows
of
cots
where
the
blankets
were
all
folded
the
same
way
on
some
of
which
men
were
sprawled
in
attitudes
of
utter
relaxation
he
kept
remarking
to
himself
how
strange
it
was
that
he
was
not
thinking
of
anything
in
the
last
few
days
his
mind
seemed
to
have
become
a
hard
meaningless
core
how
long
do
we
have
to
do
this
he
asked
the
man
who
was
working
with
him
the
man
went
on
chewing
so
that
andrews
thought
he
was
not
going
to
answer
at
all
he
was
just
beginning
to
speak
again
when
the
man
balancing
thoughtfully
on
top
of
his
ladder
drawled
out
four
we
wo
finish
today
then
the
man
shook
his
head
and
wrinkled
his
face
into
a
strange
spasm
as
he
spat
been
here
long
not
so
how
long
three
months
ai
so
the
man
spat
again
and
climbing
down
from
his
ladder
waited
leaning
against
the
wall
until
andrews
should
finish
soaping
his
window
i
go
crazy
if
i
stay
here
three
months
i
been
here
a
week
muttered
andrews
between
his
teeth
as
he
climbed
down
and
moved
his
ladder
to
the
next
window
they
both
climbed
their
ladders
again
in
silence
how
it
you
in
casuals
asked
andrews
again
ai
got
no
why
do
they
discharge
you
reckon
they
going
to
they
worked
on
in
silence
for
a
long
time
andrews
stared
at
the
upper
corner
and
smeared
with
soap
each
pane
of
the
window
in
turn
then
he
climbed
down
moved
his
ladder
and
started
on
the
next
window
at
times
he
would
start
in
the
middle
of
the
window
for
variety
as
he
worked
a
rhythm
began
pushing
its
way
through
the
hard
core
of
his
mind
leavening
it
making
it
fluid
it
expressed
the
vast
dusty
dullness
the
men
waiting
in
rows
on
drill
fields
standing
at
attention
the
monotony
of
feet
tramping
in
unison
of
the
dust
rising
from
the
battalions
going
back
and
forth
over
the
dusty
drill
fields
he
felt
the
rhythm
filling
his
whole
body
from
his
sore
hands
to
his
legs
tired
from
marching
back
and
forth
from
making
themselves
the
same
length
as
millions
of
other
legs
his
mind
began
unconsciously
from
habit
working
on
it
orchestrating
it
he
could
imagine
a
vast
orchestra
swaying
with
it
his
heart
was
beating
faster
he
must
make
it
into
music
he
must
fix
it
in
himself
so
that
he
could
make
it
into
music
and
write
it
down
so
that
orchestras
could
play
it
and
make
the
ears
of
multitudes
feel
it
make
their
flesh
tingle
with
it
he
went
on
working
through
the
endless
afternoon
climbing
up
and
down
his
ladder
smearing
the
barrack
windows
with
a
soapy
rag
a
silly
phrase
took
the
place
of
the
welling
of
music
in
his
mind
arbeit
und
he
kept
saying
it
over
and
over
to
himself
arbeit
und
he
tried
to
drive
the
phrase
out
of
his
mind
to
bury
his
mind
in
the
music
of
the
rhythm
that
had
come
to
him
that
expressed
the
dusty
boredom
the
harsh
constriction
of
warm
bodies
full
of
gestures
and
attitudes
and
aspirations
into
moulds
like
the
moulds
toy
soldiers
are
cast
in
the
phrase
became
someone
shouting
raucously
in
his
ears
arbeit
und
rhythmus
drowning
everything
else
beating
his
mind
hard
again
parching
it
but
suddenly
he
laughed
aloud
why
it
was
in
german
he
was
being
got
ready
to
kill
men
who
said
that
if
anyone
said
that
he
was
going
to
kill
him
they
were
going
to
kill
everybody
who
spoke
that
language
he
and
all
the
men
whose
feet
he
could
hear
tramping
on
the
drill
field
whose
legs
were
all
being
made
the
same
length
on
the
drill
field
iii
it
was
saturday
morning
directed
by
the
corporal
a
italian
who
even
on
the
army
diet
managed
to
keep
a
faint
odour
of
garlic
about
him
three
soldiers
in
blue
denims
were
sweeping
up
the
leaves
in
the
street
between
the
rows
of
barracks
you
fellers
are
slow
as
molasses

minutes
he
kept
saying
the
soldiers
raked
on
doggedly
paying
no
attention

damn

pass

cigarette
andrews
made
a
grimace
and
began
collecting
the
little
grey
sordid
ends
of
cigarettes
as
he
leant
over
he
found
himself
looking
into
the
eyes
of
the
soldier
who
was
working
beside
him
the
eyes
were
contracted
with
anger
and
there
was
a
flush
under
the
tan
of
the
boyish
face
ah
did
git
in
this
here
army
to
be
ordered

by
a

muttered

shouted
the
corporal
andrews
and
the
indiana
boy
went
round
with
a
broom
and
a
shovel
collecting
quids
of
tobacco
and
cigar
butts
and
stained
bits
of
paper

lively
shouted
the
corporal
waddling
about
importantly
on
his
bandy
legs
he
kept
looking
down
the
row
of
barracks
muttering
to
himself
goddam
time
fur
inspectin
now
goddam
wo
never
pass
this
his
face
froze
suddenly
into
obsequious
immobility
he
brought
his
hand
up
to
the
brim
of
his
hat
a
group
of
officers
strode
past
him
into
the
nearest
building
john
andrews
coming
back
from
emptying
the
garbage
pails
went
in
the
back
door
of
his
barracks
attention
came
the
cry
from
the
other
end
he
made
his
neck
and
arms
as
rigid
as
possible
through
the
silent
barracks
came
the
hard
clank
of
the
heels
of
the
officers
inspecting
a
sallow
face
with
hollow
eyes
and
heavy
square
jaw
came
close
to
andrews
eyes
he
stared
straight
before
him
noting
the
few
reddish
hairs
on
the
officer
adam
apple
and
the
new
insignia
on
either
side
of
his
collar
sergeant
who
is
this
man
came
a
voice
from
the
sallow
face
do
know
sir
a
new
recruit
sir
corporal
valori
who
is
this
man
the
name
andrews
sergeant
said
the
italian
corporal
with
an
obsequious
whine
in
his
voice
the
officer
addressed
andrews
directly
speaking
fast
and
loud
how
long
have
you
been
in
the
army
one
week
do
you
know
you
have
to
be
clean
and
shaved
and
ready
for
inspection
every
saturday
morning
at
nine
i
was
cleaning
the
barracks
to
teach
you
not
to
answer
back
when
an
officer
addresses
you
the
officer
spaced
his
words
carefully
lingering
on
them
as
he
spoke
he
glanced
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
at
his
superior
and
noticed
the
major
was
frowning
his
tone
changed
ever
so
slightly
if
this
ever
occurs
again
you
may
be
sure
that
disciplinary
action
will
be
taken
attention
there
at
the
other
end
of
the
barracks
a
man
had
moved
again
amid
absolute
silence
could
be
heard
the
clanking
of
the
officers
heels
as
the
inspection
continued
now
fellows
all
together
cried
the
y
man
who
stood
with
his
arms
stretched
wide
in
front
of
the
movie
screen
the
piano
started
jingling
and
the
roomful
of
crowded
soldiers
roared
out
hail
hail
the
gang
all
here
we
going
to
get
the
kaiser
we
going
to
get
the
kaiser
we
going
to
get
the
kaiser
now
the
rafters
rang
with
their
deep
voices
the
y
man
twisted
his
lean
face
into
a
facetious
expression
somebody
tried
to
put
one
over
on
the
man
and
sing
the
hell
do
we
care
but
you
do
care
do
you
buddy
he
shouted
there
was
a
little
rattle
of
laughter
now
once
more
said
the
y
man
again
and
lots
of
guts
in
the
get
and
lots
of
kill
in
the
kaiser
now
all
together
the
moving
pictures
had
begun
john
andrews
looked
furtively
about
him
at
the
face
of
the
indiana
boy
beside
him
intent
on
the
screen
at
the
tanned
faces
and
the
heads
that
rose
above
the
mass
of
bodies
about
him
here
and
there
a
pair
of
eyes
glinted
in
the
white
flickering
light
from
the
screen
waves
of
laughter
or
of
little
exclamations
passed
over
them
they
were
all
so
alike
they
seemed
at
moments
to
be
but
one
organism
this
was
what
he
had
sought
when
he
had
enlisted
he
said
to
himself
it
was
in
this
that
he
would
take
refuge
from
the
horror
of
the
world
that
had
fallen
upon
him
he
was
sick
of
revolt
of
thought
of
carrying
his
individuality
like
a
banner
above
the
turmoil
this
was
much
better
to
let
everything
go
to
stamp
out
his
maddening
desire
for
music
to
humble
himself
into
the
mud
of
common
slavery
he
was
still
tingling
with
sudden
anger
from
the
officer
voice
that
morning
sergeant
who
is
this
man
the
officer
had
stared
in
his
face
as
a
man
might
stare
at
a
piece
of
furniture
ai
this
some
film
chrisfield
turned
to
him
with
a
smile
that
drove
his
anger
away
in
a
pleasant

elaborately
in

intermission
between

two
parts
of
the
movie
the
indiana
boy
leaned
in
front
of
john
andrews
putting
an
arm
round

shoulders
and
talked

oh
a
week
or
two
said
andrews
as
long
as
that
but
the
movie
had
begun
again
unfolding
scenes
of
soldiers
in
spiked
helmets
marching
into
belgian
cities
full
of
little
milk
carts
drawn
by
dogs
and
old
women
in
peasant
costume
there
were
hisses
and
catcalls
when
a
german
flag
was
seen
and
as
the
troops
were
pictured
advancing
bayonetting
the
civilians
in
wide
dutch
pants
the
old
women
with
starched
caps
the
soldiers
packed
into
the
stuffy
hut
shouted
oaths
at
them
andrews
felt
blind
hatred
stirring
like
something
that
had
a
life
of
its
own
in
the
young
men
about
him
he
was
lost
in
it
carried
away
in
it
as
in
a
stampede
of
wild
cattle
the
terror
of
it
was
like
ferocious
hands
clutching
his
throat
he
glanced
at
the
faces
round
him
they
were
all
intent
and
flushed
glinting
with
sweat
in
the
heat
of
the
room
as
he
was
leaving
the
hut
pressed
in
a
tight
stream
of
soldiers
moving
towards
the
door
andrews
heard
a
man
say
i
never
raped
a
woman
in
my
life
but
by
god
i
going
to
i
give
a
lot
to
rape
some
of
those
goddam
german
i
hate
too
came
another
voice
men
women
children
and
unborn
children
they
either
jackasses
or
full
of
the
lust
for
power
like
their
rulers
are
to
let
themselves
be
governed
by
a
bunch
of
warlords
like
ah
lahk
te
cepture
a
german
officer
an
make
him
shine
ma
boots
then
shoot
him
dead
said
chris
to
andrews
as
they
walked
down
the
long
row
towards
their
barracks
you
would
but

damn
side

big
squirt

to
think
that
just
because
ah
littler
than
him
he
can
do
anything
he
likes
with
andrews
turned
sharply
and
looked
in
his
companion
face
something
in
the
gruffness
of
the
boy
tone
startled
him
he
was
not
accustomed
to
this
he
had
thought
of
himself
as
a
passionate
person
but
never
in
his
life
had
he
wanted
to
kill
a
man
really
want
to
kill
him
not

but
he
gits
the

long
pause
ah

guy

the
sea
if
we
both
go
over
on
the
same
boat
said
chrisfield
laughing
but
he
added
after
a
pause
it
would
have
been
hell
if
ah
killed
that
feller
though
honest
ah
would
to
do
that
the
job
that
pays
a
violinist
said
somebody
no
it
do
came
a
melancholy
drawling
voice
from
a
lanky
man
who
sat
doubled
up
with
his
long
face
in
his
hands
and
his
elbows
resting
on
his
knees
just
brings
a
living
wage
a
living
several
men
were
grouped
at
the
end
of
the
barracks
from
them
the
long
row
of
cots
with
here
and
there
a
man
asleep
or
a
man
hastily
undressing
stretched
lighted
by
occasional
feeble
bulbs
to
the
sergeant
little
table
beside
the
door
you
gettin
a
are
you
asked
a
man
with
a
brogue
and
the
red
face
of
a
jovial
gorilla
that
signified
the
bartender
yes
flannagan
i
am
said
the
lanky
man
dolefully
ai
he
got
hard
luck
came
a
voice
from
the
crowd
yes
i
have
got
hard
luck
buddy
said
the
lanky
man
looking
at
the
faces
about
him
out
of
sunken
eyes

be
getting
forty
dollars
a
week
and
here

democratic
army
chanted
someone
under
his
breath
but
begorry
i
want
to
go
overseas
and
a
look
at
the
said
flannagan
who
managed
with
strange
skill
to
combine
a
cockney
whine
with
his
irish
brogue
overseas
took
up
the
lanky
man
if
i
could
have
gone
an
studied
overseas
i
be
making
as
much
as
kubelik
i
had
the
makings
of
a
good
player
in
why

asked
andrews
who
stood
on
the
outskirts
with
fuselli
and
chris
look
at
me
said
the
lanky
man
well
they
ca
get
me
over
there
soon
enough
said
flannagan
must
be
funny
not
bein
able
to
understand
what
folks

they
say
over
there
when
they
mean
a
guy
told
ye
can
make
signs
to
them
ca
ye
said
flannagan
an
they
can
understand
an
irishman
anywhere
but
ye
wo
to
talk
to
the
begorry
i
set
up
in
business
when
i
get

what
d
think
of
that
everybody
laughed
how
that
do
i
start
an
irish
house
in
berlin
i
will
and
there
be
and
and
and
and
begod
the
king
of
england
himself
come
an
set
the
goddam
kaiser
up
to
a
the
kaiser
be
strung
up
on
a
telephone
pole
by
that
time
ye
worry
they
ought
to
torture
him
to
death
like
they
do
niggers
when
they
lynch
down
a
bugle
sounded
far
away
outside
on
the
parade
ground
everyone
slunk
away
silently
to
his
cot
john
andrews
arranged
himself
carefully
in
his
blankets
promising
himself
a
quiet
time
of
thought
before
going
to
sleep
he
needed
to
be
awake
and
think
at
night
this
way
so
that
he
might
not
lose
entirely
the
thread
of
his
own
life
of
the
life
he
would
take
up
again
some
day
if
he
lived
through
it
he
brushed
away
the
thought
of
death
it
was
uninteresting
he
did
care
anyway
but
some
day
he
would
want
to
play
the
piano
again
to
write
music
he
must
not
let
himself
sink
too
deeply
into
the
helpless
mentality
of
the
soldier
he
must
keep
his
will
power
no
but
that
was
not
what
he
had
wanted
to
think
about
he
was
so
bored
with
himself
at
any
cost
he
must
forget
himself
ever
since
his
first
year
at
college
he
seemed
to
have
done
nothing
but
think
about
himself
talk
about
himself
at
least
at
the
bottom
in
the
utterest
degradation
of
slavery
he
could
find
forgetfulness
and
start
rebuilding
the
fabric
of
his
life
out
of
real
things
this
time
out
of
work
and
comradeship
and
scorn
scorn
that
was
the
quality
he
needed
it
was
such
a
raw
fantastic
world
he
had
suddenly
fallen
into
his
life
before
this
week
seemed
a
dream
read
in
a
novel
a
picture
he
had
seen
in
a
shop
window
it
was
so
different
could
it
have
been
in
the
same
world
at
all
he
must
have
died
without
knowing
it
and
been
born
again
into
a
new
futile
hell
when
he
had
been
a
child
he
had
lived
in
a
dilapidated
mansion
that
stood
among
old
oaks
and
chestnuts
beside
a
road
where
buggies
and
oxcarts
passed
rarely
to
disturb
the
sandy
ruts
that
lay
in
the
mottled
shade
he
had
had
so
many
dreams
lying
under
the
bush
at
the
end
of
the
overgrown
garden
he
had
passed
the
long
virginia
afternoons
thinking
while
the
dryflies
whizzed
sleepily
in
the
sunlight
of
the
world
he
would
live
in
when
he
grew
up
he
had
planned
so
many
lives
for
himself
a
general
like
caesar
he
was
to
conquer
the
world
and
die
murdered
in
a
great
marble
hall
a
wandering
minstrel
he
would
go
through
all
countries
singing
and
have
intricate
endless
adventures
a
great
musician
he
would
sit
at
the
piano
playing
like
chopin
in
the
engraving
while
beautiful
women
wept
and
men
with
long
curly
hair
hid
their
faces
in
their
hands
it
was
only
slavery
that
he
had
not
foreseen
his
race
had
dominated
for
too
many
centuries
for
that
and
yet
the
world
was
made
of
various
slaveries
john
andrews
lay
on
his
back
on
his
cot
while
everyone
about
him
slept
and
snored
in
the
dark
barracks
a
certain
terror
held
him
in
a
week
the
great
structure
of
his
romantic
world
so
full
of
many
colors
and
harmonies
that
had
survived
school
and
college
and
the
buffeting
of
making
a
living
in
new
york
had
fallen
in
dust
about
him
he
was
utterly
in
the
void
how
silly
he
thought
this
is
the
world
as
it
has
appeared
to
the
majority
of
men
this
is
just
the
lower
half
of
the
he
thought
of
his
friends
of
fuselli
and
chrisfield
and
that
funny
little
man
eisenstein
they
seemed
at
home
in
this
army
life
they
did
not
seem
appalled
by
the
loss
of
their
liberty
but
they
had
never
lived
in
the
glittering
other
world
yet
he
could
not
feel
the
scorn
of
them
he
wanted
to
feel
he
thought
of
them
singing
under
the
direction
of
the
y
man
hail
hail
the
gang
all
here
we
going
to
get
the
kaiser
we
going
to
get
the
kaiser
we
going
to
get
the
kaiser
now
he
thought
of
himself
and
chrisfield
picking
up
cigarette
butts
and
the
tramp
tramp
tramp
of
feet
on
the
drill
field
where
was
the
connection
was
this
all
futile
madness
they
come
from
such
various
worlds
all
these
men
sleeping
about
him
to
be
united
in
this
and
what
did
they
think
of
it
all
these
sleepers
had
they
too
not
had
dreams
when
they
were
boys
or
had
the
generations
prepared
them
only
for
this
he
thought
of
himself
lying
under
the
bush
through
the
hot
droning
afternoon
watching
the
pale
magenta
flowers
flutter
down
into
the
dry
grass
and
felt
again
wrapped
in
his
warm
blankets
among
all
these
sleepers
the
straining
of
limbs
burning
with
desire
to
rush
untrammelled
through
some
new
keen
air
suddenly
darkness
overspread
his
mind
he
woke
with
a
start
the
bugle
was
blowing
outside
all
right
look
lively
the
sergeant
was
shouting
another
day
iv
the
stars
were
very
bright
when
fuselli
eyes
stinging
with
sleep
stumbled
out
of
the
barracks
they
trembled
like
bits
of
brilliant
jelly
in
the
black
velvet
of
the
sky
just
as
something
inside
him
trembled
with
excitement
anybody
know
where
the
electricity
turns
on
asked
the
sergeant
in
a
voice
here
it
the
light
over
the
door
of
the
barracks
snapped
on
revealing
a
rotund
cheerful
man
with
a
little
yellow
mustache
and
an
unlit
cigarette
dangling
out
of
the
corner
of
his
mouth
grouped
about
him
in
overcoats
and
caps
the
men
of
the
company
rested
their
packs
against
their
knees
all
right
line
up
eyes
looked
curiously
at
fuselli
as
he
lined
up
with
the
rest
he
had
been
transferred
into
the
company
the
night
before
attenshun
shouted
the
sergeant
then
he
wrinkled
up
his
eyes
and
grinned
hard
at
the
slip
of
paper
he
had
in
his
hand
while
the
men
of
his
company
watched
him
affectionately
answer
when
your
name
is
called
allan
yo
came
a
shrill
voice
from
the
end
of
the
line
meanwhile
outside
the
other
barracks
other
companies
could
be
heard
calling
the
roll
somewhere
from
the
end
of
the
street
came
a
cheer
well
i
guess
i
can
tell
you
now
fellers
said
the
sergeant
with
his
air
of
quiet
omniscience
when
he
had
called
the
last
name
we
going
everybody
cheered
shut
up
you
do
want
the
huns
to
hear
us
do
you
the
company
laughed
and
there
was
a
broad
grin
on
the
sergeant
round
face
seem
to
have
a
pretty
decent
whispered
fuselli
to
the
man
next
to
him
you
bet
yer
kid
he
a
peach
said
the
other
man
in
a
voice
full
of
devotion
this
is
some
company
i
can
tell
you
you
bet
it
is
said
the
next
man
along
the
corporal
in
the
red
sox
the
lieutenant
appeared
suddenly
in
the
area
of
light
in
front
of
the
barracks
he
was
a
boy
his
trench
coat
a
little
too
large
was
very
new
and
stuck
out
stiffly
from
his
legs
everything
all
right
sergeant
everything
all
right
he
asked
several
times
shifting
his
weight
from
one
foot
to
the
other
all
ready
for
entrainment
sir
said
the
sergeant
heartily
very
good
i
let
you
know
the
order
of
march
in
a
fuselli
ears
pounded
with
strange
excitement
these
phrases
entrainment
order
of
march
had
a
businesslike
sound
he
suddenly
started
to
wonder
how
it
would
feel
to
be
under
fire
memories
of
movies
flickered
in
his
mind
gawd
ai
i
glad
to
git
out
o
this
he
said
to
the
man
next
him
the
next
one
may
be
more
of
a
yet
buddy
said
the
sergeant
striding
up
and
down
with
his
important
confident
walk
everybody
laughed
he
some
sergeant
our
sergeant

said
the
man
next
to
fuselli
he
got
brains
in
his
head
that
boy

said
the
sergeant
but
if
anybody
moves
away
from
this
barracks
i
put
him
in
till
till
he
be
able
to
peel
spuds
in
his
the
company
laughed
again
fuselli
noticed
with
displeasure
that
the
tall
man
with
the
shrill
voice
whose
name
had
been
called
first
on
the
roll
did
not
laugh
but
spat
disgustedly
out
of
the
corner
of
his
mouth
well
there
are
bad
eggs
in
every
good
bunch
thought
fuselli
it
gradually
grew
grey
with
dawn
fuselli
legs
were
tired
from
standing
so
long
outside
all
the
barracks
as
far
as
he
could
see
up
the
street
men
stood
in
ragged
lines
waiting
the
sun
rose
hot
on
a
cloudless
day
a
few
sparrows
twittered
about
the
tin
roof
of
the
barracks
hell
we
not
goin
this
why
asked
somebody
savagely
troops
always
leaves
at
the
hell
they
do
here
comes
everybody
craned
their
necks
in
the
direction
pointed
out
the
sergeant
strolled
up
with
a
mysterious
smile
on
his
face
put
away
your
overcoats
and
get
out
your
mess
mess
kits
clattered
and
gleamed
in
the
slanting
rays
of
the
sun
they
marched
to
the
mess
hall
and
back
again
lined
up
again
with
packs
and
waited
some
more
everybody
began
to
get
tired
and
peevish
fuselli
wondered
where
his
old
friends
of
the
other
company
were
they
were
good
kids
too
chris
and
that
educated
fellow
andrews
tough
luck
they
could
have
come
along
the
sun
rose
higher
men
sneaked
into
the
barracks
one
by
one
and
lay
down
on
the
bare
cots
what
you
want
to
bet
we
wo
leave
this
camp
for
a
week
yet
asked
someone
at
noon
they
lined
up
for
mess
again
ate
dismally
and
hurriedly
as
fuselli
was
leaving
the
mess
hall
tapping
a
tattoo
on
his
kit
with
two
dirty
finger
nails
the
corporal
spoke
to
him
in
a
low
voice
be
sure
to
wash
yer
kit
buddy
we
may
have
pack
the
corporal
was
a
slim
man
with
a
wrinkled
skin
though
he
was
still
young
and
an
mouth
that
opened
and
shut
like
the
paper
mouths
children
make
all
right
corporal
fuselli
answered
cheerfully
he
wanted
to
make
a
good
impression
fellers
be
sayin
right
corporal
to
me
soon
he
thought
an
idea
that
he
repelled
came
into
his
mind
the
corporal
did
look
strong
he
would
last
long
overseas
and
he
pictured
mabe
writing
corporal
dan
fuselli
at
the
end
of
the
afternoon
the
lieutenant
appeared
suddenly
his
face
flushed
his
trench
coat
stiffer
than
ever
all
right
sergeant
line
up
your
men
he
said
in
a
breathless
voice
all
down
the
camp
street
companies
were
forming
one
by
one
they
marched
out
in
columns
of
fours
and
halted
with
their
packs
on
the
day
was
getting
amber
with
sunset
retreat
sounded
fuselli
mind
had
suddenly
become
very
active
the
notes
of
the
bugle
and
of
the
band
playing
the
star
spangled
banner
sifted
into
his
consciousness
through
a
dream
of
what
it
would
be
like
over
there
he
was
in
a
place
like
the
exposition
ground
full
of
old
men
and
women
in
peasant
costume
like
in
the
song
when
it
apple
blossom
time
in
men
in
spiked
helmets
who
looked
like
firemen
kept
charging
through
like
the
klan
in
the
movies
jumping
from
their
horses
and
setting
fire
to
buildings
with
strange
outlandish
gestures
spitting
babies
on
their
long
swords
those
were
the
huns
then
there
were
flags
blowing
very
hard
in
the
wind
and
the
sound
of
a
band
the
yanks
were
coming
everything
was
lost
in
a
scene
from
a
movie
in
which
regiments
marched
fast
fast
across
the
scene
the
memory
of
the
shouting
that
always
accompanied
it
drowned
out
the
picture
the
guns
must
make
a
racket
though
he
added
as
an
forwa
ard
march
the
long
street
of
the
camp
was
full
of
the
tramping
of
feet
they
were
off
as
they
passed
through
the
gate
fuselli
caught
a
glimpse
of
chris
standing
with
his
arm
about
andrews
shoulders
they
both
waved
fuselli
grinned
and
expanded
his
chest
they
were
just
rookies
still
he
was
going
overseas
the
weight
of
the
pack
tugged
at
his
shoulders
and
made
his
feet
heavy
as
if
they
were
charged
with
lead
the
sweat
ran
down
his
head
under
the
overseas
cap
and
streamed
into
his
eyes
and
down
the
sides
of
his
nose
through
the
tramp
of
feet
he
heard
confusedly
cheering
from
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
him
the
backs
of
heads
and
the
swaying
packs
got
smaller
rank
by
rank
up
the
street
above
them
flags
dangled
from
windows
flags
leisurely
swaying
in
the
twilight
but
the
weight
of
the
pack
as
the
column
marched
under
arc
lights
glaring
through
the
afterglow
inevitably
forced
his
head
to
droop
forward
the
soles
of
boots
and
legs
wrapped
in
puttees
and
the
bottom
strap
of
the
pack
of
the
man
ahead
of
him
were
all
he
could
see
the
pack
seemed
heavy
enough
to
push
him
through
the
asphalt
pavement
and
all
about
him
was
the
faint
jingle
of
equipment
and
the
tramp
of
feet
every
part
of
him
was
full
of
sweat
he
could
feel
vaguely
the
steam
of
sweat
that
rose
from
the
ranks
of
struggling
bodies
about
him
but
gradually
he
forgot
everything
but
the
pack
tugging
at
his
shoulders
weighing
down
his
thighs
and
ankles
and
feet
and
the
monotonous
rhythm
of
his
feet
striking
the
pavement
and
of
the
other
feet
in
front
of
him
behind
him
beside
him
crunching
crunching
the
train
smelt
of
new
uniforms
on
which
the
sweat
had
dried
and
of
the
smoke
of
cheap
cigarettes
fuselli
awoke
with
a
start
he
had
been
asleep
with
his
head
on
bill
grey
shoulder
it
was
already
broad
daylight
the
train
was
jolting
slowly
over
in
some
dismal
suburb
full
of
long
warehouses
and
endless
rows
of
freight
cars
beyond
which
lay
brown
marshland
and
stretches
of
water
god
that
must
be
the
atlantic
ocean
cried
fuselli
in
excitement
ai
yer
never
seen
it
before
that
the
perth
river
said
bill
grey
scornfully
no
i
come
from
the
they
stuck
their
heads
out
of
the
window
side
by
side
so
that
their
cheeks
touched
gee
there
some
skirts
said
bill
grey
the
train
jolted
to
a
stop
two
untidy
girls
were
standing
beside
the
track
waving
their
hands
give
us
a
kiss
cried
bill
grey
sure
said
a
girl
anythin
fer
one
of
our
she
stood
on
tiptoe
and
grey
leaned
far
out
of
the
window
just
managing
to
reach
the
girl
forehead
fuselli
felt
a
flush
of
desire
all
over
him
hol
onter
my
belt
he
said
i
kiss
her
he
leaned
far
out
and
throwing
his
arms
around
the
girl
pink
gingham
shoulders
lifted
her
off
the
ground
and
kissed
her
furiously
on
the
lips
lem

go
lem
me
go
cried
the
girl
men
leaning
out
of
the
other
windows
of
the
car
cheered
and
shouted
fuselli
kissed
her
again
and
then
dropped
her
ye
too
rough
damn
ye
said
the
girl
angrily
a
man
from
one
of
the
windows
yelled
i
go
an
tell
mommer
and
everybody
laughed
the
train
moved
on
fuselli
looked
about
him
proudly
the
image
of
mabe
giving
him
the
box
of
candy
rose
a
moment
in
his
mind
ai
no
harm
in
havin
a
little
fun
do
mean
nothin
he
said
aloud
you
just
wait
till
we
hit
france
we
hit
it
up
some
with
the
madimerzels
wo
we
kid
said
bill
grey
slapping
fuselli
on
the
knee
beautiful
katy

only
that
i
adore
and
when
the
shines
over
the
cowshed
i
be
waiting
at
the
everybody
sang
as
the
thumping
of
wheels
over
rails
grew
faster
fuselli
looked
about
contentedly
at
the
company
sprawling
over
their
packs
and
equipment
in
the
smoky
car
it
great
to
be
a
soldier
he
said
to
bill
grey
ye
kin
do
anything
ye
goddam
this
said
the
corporal
as
the
company
filed
into
barracks
identical
to
those
they
had
left
two
days
before
is
an
embarkation
camp
but
like
to
know
where
the
hell
we
embark
he
twisted
his
face
into
a
smile
and
then
shouted
with
lugubrious
intonation
fall
in
for
it
was
pitch
dark
in
that
part
of
the
camp
the
electric
lights
had
a
sparse
reddish
glow
fuselli
kept
straining
his
eyes
expecting
to
see
a
wharf
and
the
masts
of
a
ship
at
the
end
of
every
alley
the
line
filed
into
a
dim
mess
hall
where
a
thin
stew
was
splashed
into
the
mess
kits
behind
the
counter
of
the
kitchen
the
the
jovial
first
sergeant
and
the
businesslike
sergeant
who
looked
like
a
preacher
and
the
corporal
who
had
been
on
the
red
sox
outfield
could
be
seen
eating
steak
a
faint
odor
of
steak
frying
went
through
the
mess
hall
and
made
the
thin
chilly
stew
utterly
tasteless
in
comparison
fuselli
looked
enviously
towards
the
kitchen
and
thought
of
the
day
when
he
would
be
a
too
i
got
to
get
busy
he
said
to
himself
earnestly
overseas
under
fire
he
have
a
chance
to
show
what
he
was
worth
and
he
pictured
himself
heroically
carrying
a
wounded
captain
back
to
a
dressing
tent
pursued
by
men
with
spiked
helmets
like
firemen
helmets
the
strumming
of
a
guitar
came
strangely
down
the
dark
street
of
the
camp
some
guy
sure
can
play
said
bill
grey
who
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
slouched
along
beside
fuselli
they
looked
in
the
door
of
one
of
the
barracks
a
lot
of
soldiers
were
sitting
in
a
ring
round
two
tall
negroes
whose
black
faces
and
chests
glistened
like
jet
in
the
faint
light
come
on
charley
give
us
another
said
someone
do
ah
git
it
now
or
mus
ah
one
negro
began
chanting
while
the
other
strummed
carelessly
on
the
guitar
no
give
us
the
the
guitar
strummed
in
a
crooning
for
a
moment
the
voice
broke
into
it
suddenly
pitched
high
dis
is
de
song
ob
de
titanic
sailin
on
de
the
guitar
strummed
on
there
had
been
a
tension
in
the
voice
that
had
made
everyone
stop
talking
the
soldiers
looked
at
him
curiously
how
de
titanic
ran
in
dat
cole
iceberg
how
de
titanic
ran
in
dat
cole
iceberg
sailin
on
de
his
voice
was
confidential
and
soft
and
the
guitar
strummed
to
the
same
sobbing
verse
after
verse
the
voice
grew
louder
and
the
strumming
faster
de

the
guitar
was
strumming
the
the
negro
was
singing
with
every
cord
in
his
throat
taut
almost
sobbing
a
man
next
to
fuselli
took
careful
aim
and
spat
into
the
box
of
sawdust
in
the
middle
of
the
ring
of
motionless
soldiers
the
guitar
played
the
again
fast
almost
mockingly
the
negro
sang
in
low
confidential
tones

before
he
had
finished
a
bugle
blew
in
the
distance
everybody
scattered
fuselli
and
bill
grey
went
silently
back
to
their
barracks
it
must
be
an
awful
thing
to
drown
in
the
sea
said
grey
as
he
rolled
himself
in
his
blankets
if
one
of
those
bastard
i
do
give
a
damn
said
fuselli
boisterously
but
as
he
lay
staring
into
the
darkness
cold
terror
stiffened
him
suddenly
he
thought
for
a
moment
of
deserting
pretending
he
was
sick
anything
to
keep
from
going
on
the
transport
o
de
women
an
de
chilen
dey
sank
in
de

roun
dat
cole
he
could
feel
himself
going
down
through
icy
water
it
a
hell
of
a
thing
to
send
a
guy
over
there
to
drown
he
said
to
himself
and
he
thought
of
the
hilly
streets
of
san
francisco
and
the
glow
of
the
sunset
over
the
harbor
and
ships
coming
in
through
the
golden
gate
his
mind
went
gradually
blank
and
he
went
to
sleep
the
column
was
like
some
curious
carpet
hiding
the
road
as
far
as
you
could
see
in
fuselli
company
the
men
were
shifting
their
weight
from
one
foot
to
the
other
muttering
what
the
hell
they
waiting
for
now
bill
grey
next
to
fuselli
in
the
ranks
stood
bent
double
so
as
to
take
the
weight
of
his
pack
off
his
shoulders
they
were
at
a
on
fairly
high
ground
so
that
they
could
see
the
long
sheds
and
barracks
of
the
camp
stretching
away
in
every
direction
in
rows
and
rows
broken
now
and
then
by
a
grey
drill
field
in
front
of
them
the
column
stretched
to
the
last
bend
in
the
road
where
it
disappeared
on
a
hill
among
suburban
houses
fuselli
was
excited
he
kept
thinking
of
the
night
before
when
he
had
helped
the
sergeant
distribute
emergency
rations
and
had
carried
about
piles
of
boxes
of
hard
bread
counting
them
carefully
without
a
mistake
he
felt
full
of
desire
to
do
things
to
show
what
he
was
good
for
gee
he
said
to
himself
this
war
a
lucky
thing
for
me
i
might
have
been
in
the
vicker
company
store
for
five
years
an
never
got
a
raise
an
here
in
the
army
i
got
a
chance
to
do
almost
far
ahead
down
the
road
the
column
was
beginning
to
move
voices
shouting
orders
beat
crisply
on
the
morning
air
fuselli
heart
was
thumping
he
felt
proud
of
himself
and
of
the
company
the
damn
best
company
in
the
whole
outfit
the
company
ahead
was
moving
it
was
their
turn
now
forwa
ard
march
they
were
lost
in
the
monotonous
tramp
of
feet
dust
rose
from
the
road
along
which
like
a
drab
brown
worm
crawled
the
column
a
sickening
unfamiliar
smell
choked
their
nostrils
what
are
they
taking
us
down
here
for
damned
if
i
they
were
filing
down
ladders
into
the
terrifying
pit
which
the
hold
of
the
ship
seemed
to
them
every
man
had
a
blue
card
in
his
hand
with
a
number
on
it
in
a
dim
place
like
an
empty
warehouse
they
stopped
the
sergeant
shouted
out
i
guess
this
is
our
diggings
we
have
to
make
the
best
of
then
he
disappeared
fuselli
looked
about
him
he
was
sitting
in
one
of
the
lowest
of
three
tiers
of
bunks
roughly
built
of
new
pine
boards
electric
lights
placed
here
and
there
gave
a
faint
reddish
tone
to
the
gloom
except
at
the
ladders
where
lamps
made
a
white
glare
the
place
was
full
of
tramping
of
feet
and
the
sound
of
packs
being
thrown
on
bunks
as
endless
files
of
soldiers
poured
in
down
every
ladder
somewhere
down
the
alley
an
officer
with
a
shrill
voice
was
shouting
to
his
men
speed
it
up
there
speed
it
up
fuselli
sat
on
his
bunk
looking
at
the
terrifying
confusion
all
about
feeling
bewildered
and
humiliated
for
how
many
days
would
they
be
in
that
dark
pit
he
suddenly
felt
angry
they
had
no
right
to
treat
a
feller
like
that
he
was
a
man
not
a
bale
of
hay
to
be
bundled
about
as
anybody
liked
an
if
we
torpedoed
a
fat
chance
we
have
down
here
he
said
aloud
they
got
sentries
posted
to
keep
us
from
goin
up
on
deck
said
someone
god
damn
them
they
treat
you
like
you
was
a
steer
being
taken
over
for
well
you
not
a
damn
sight
more
meat
for
the
a
little
man
lying
in
one
of
the
upper
bunks
had
spoken
suddenly
contracting
his
sallow
face
into
a
curious
spasm
as
if
the
words
had
burst
from
him
in
spite
of
an
effort
to
keep
them
in
everybody
looked
up
at
him
angrily
that
goddam
kike
eisenstein
muttered
someone
say
tie
that
bull
outside
shouted
bill
grey
fools
muttered
eisenstein
turning
over
and
burying
his
face
in
his
hands
gee
i
wonder
what
it
is
makes
it
smell
so
funny
down
here
said
fuselli
fuselli
lay
flat
on
deck
resting
his
head
on
his
crossed
arms
when
he
looked
straight
up
he
could
see
a
mast
sweep
back
and
forth
across
the
sky
full
of
clouds
of
light
grey
and
silver
and
dark
showing
yellowish
at
the
edges
when
he
tilted
his
head
a
little
to
one
side
he
could
see
bill
grey
heavy
colorless
face
and
the
dark
bristles
of
his
unshaven
chin
and
his
mouth
a
little
twisted
to
the
left
from
which
a
cigarette
dangled
unlighted
beyond
were
heads
and
bodies
huddled
together
in
a
mass
of
khaki
overcoats
and
life
preservers
and
when
the
roll
tipped
the
deck
he
had
a
view
of
moving
green
waves
and
of
a
steamer
striped
grey
and
white
and
the
horizon
a
dark
taut
line
broken
here
and
there
by
the
tops
of
waves
o
god
i
feel
sick
said
bill
grey
taking
the
cigarette
out
of
his
mouth
and
looking
at
it
revengefully
i
be
all
right
if
everything
did
stink
so
an
that
mess
hall
nearly
makes
a
guy
puke
to
think
of
fuselli
spoke
in
a
whining
voice
watching
the
top
of
the
mast
move
like
a
pencil
scrawling
on
paper
back
and
forth
across
the
mottled
clouds
you
again
a
brown
face
with
thick
black
eyebrows
and
hair
curling
crisply
about
a
forehead
with
many
horizontal
wrinkles
rose
from
the
deck
on
the
other
side
of
fuselli
get
the
hell
out
of
feel
sick
sonny
came
the
deep
voice
again
and
the
dark
eyebrows
contracted
in
an
expression
of
sympathy
funny
i
have
my
sixshooter
out
if
i
was
home
and
you
told
me
to
get
the
hell
out

fuselli
peevishly

days

the
plains

have
to
herd
you
round
like
meadville
got
to
his
feet
and
went
unsteadily
to
the
rail
keeping
as
he
threaded
his
way
through
the
groups
that
covered
the
transport
after
deck
a
little
of
his
cowboy
stride
i
know
what
it
is
that
makes
men
eyes
blink
when
they
go
down
to
that
putrid
mess
came
a
nasal
voice
fuselli
turned
round
eisenstein
was
sitting
in
the
place
meadville
had
just
left
you
do
do
you
it
part
of
the
system

tolstoi

voice
confidentially

horse

the
place

said
eisenstein
lowering
his
head
sullenly
you

three
winks
to
get
out
o
my
place
said
meadville
squaring
his
broad
shoulders
you
are
stronger
than
me
said
eisenstein
moving
off
god
it
hell
not
to
have
a
gun
muttered
meadville
as
he
settled
himself
on
the
deck
again
d
know
sonny
i
nearly
cried
when
i
found
i
was
going
to
be
in
this
damn
medical
corps
i
enlisted
for
the
tanks
this
is
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
have
had
a
gun
i
even
think
i
had
one
in
my
that
funny
said
fuselli
the
sergeant
appeared
suddenly
in
the
middle
of
the
group
his
face
red
say
fellers
he
said
in
a
low
voice
go
down
an
straighten
out
the
bunks
as
fast
as
you
goddam
can
they
having
an
inspection
it
a
hell
of
a
they
all
filed
down
the
gang
planks
into
the
hold
where
there
was
no
light
but
the
invariable
reddish
glow
of
electric
bulbs
they
had
hardly
reached
their
bunks
when
someone
called
attention
three
officers
stalked
by
their
firm
important
tread
a
little
disturbed
by
the
rolling
their
heads
were
stuck
forward
and
they
peered
from
side
to
side
among
the
bunks
with
the
cruel
searching
glance
of
hens
looking
for
worms
fuselli
said
the
first
sergeant
bring
up
the
record
book
to
my
stateroom
on
the
lower
all
right
sarge
said
fuselli
with
alacrity
he
admired
the
first
sergeant
and
wished
he
could
imitate
his
jovial
domineering
manner
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
been
in
the
upper
part
of
the
ship
it
seemed
a
different
world
the
long
corridors
with
red
carpets
the
white
paint
and
the
gilt
mouldings
on
the
partitions
the
officers
strolling
about
at
their
ease
it
all
made
him
think
of
the
big
liners
he
used
to
watch
come
in
through
the
golden
gate
the
liners
he
was
going
to
europe
on
some
day
when
he
got
rich
oh
if
he
could
only
get
to
be
a
sergeant
all
this
comfort
and
magnificence
would
be
his
he
found
the
number
and
knocked
on
the
door
laughter
and
loud
talking
came
from
inside
the
stateroom
wait
a
sec
came
an
unfamiliar
voice
sergeant
olster
here
oh
it
one
o
my
gang
came
the
sergeant
voice
let
him
in
he
wo
peach
on
the
door
opened
and
he
saw
sergeant
olster
and
two
other
young
men
sitting
with
their
feet
dangling
over
the
red
varnished
boards
that
enclosed
the
bunks
they
were
talking
gaily
and
had
glasses
in
their
hands
paris
is
some
town
i
can
tell
you
one
was
saying
they
say
the
girls
come
up
an
put
their
arms
round
you
right
in
the
main
here
the
records
sergeant
said
fuselli
stiffly
in
his
best
military
manner
oh
thanks
there
nothing
else
i
want
said
the
sergeant
his
voice
more
jovial
than
ever
do
fall
overboard
like
the
guy
in
company
fuselli
laughed
as
he
closed
the
door
growing
serious
suddenly
on
noticing
that
one
of
the
young
men
wore
in
his
shirt
the
gold
bar
of
a
second
lieutenant
gee
he
said
to
himself
i
ought
to
have
he
waited
a
moment
outside
the
closed
door
of
the
stateroom
listening
to
the
talk
and
the
laughter
wishing
he
were
one
of
that
merry
group
talking
about
women
in
paris
he
began
thinking
sure
he
get
private
as
soon
as
they
got
overseas
then
in
a
couple
of
months
he
might
be
corporal
if
they
saw
much
service
he
move
along
all
right
once
he
got
to
be
a
oh
i
must
get
in
wrong
oh
i
must
get
in
wrong
he
kept
saying
to
himself
as
he
went
down
the
ladder
into
the
hold
but
he
forgot
everything
in
the
seasickness
that
came
on
again
as
he
breathed
in
the
fetid
air
the
deck
now
slanted
down
in
front
of
him
now
rose
so
that
he
was
walking
up
an
incline
dirty
water
slushed
about
from
one
side
of
the
passage
to
the
other
with
every
lurch
of
the
ship
when
he
reached
the
door
the
whistling
howl
of
the
wind
through
the
hinges
and
cracks
made
fuselli
hesitate
a
long
time
with
his
hand
on
the
knob
the
moment
he
turned
the
knob
the
door
flew
open
and
he
was
in
the
full
sweep
of
the
wind
the
deck
was
deserted
the
wet
ropes
strung
along
it
shivered
dismally
in
the
wind
every
other
moment
came
the
rattle
of
spray
that
rose
up
in
white
fringy
trees
to
windward
and
smashed
against
him
like
hail
without
closing
the
door
he
crept
forward
along
the
deck
clinging
as
hard
as
he
could
to
the
icy
rope
beyond
the
spray
he
could
see
huge
marbled
green
waves
rise
in
constant
succession
out
of
the
mist
the
roar
of
the
wind
in
his
ears
confused
him
and
terrified
him
it
seemed
ages
before
he
reached
the
door
of
the
forward
house
that
opened
on
a
passage
that
smelt
of
drugs
and
breathed
out
air
where
men
waited
in
a
packed
line
thrown
one
against
the
other
by
the
lurching
of
the
boat
to
get
into
the
dispensary
the
roar
of
the
wind
came
to
them
faintly
and
only
now
and
then
the
hollow
thump
of
a
wave
against
the
bow
you
sick
a
man
asked
fuselli
naw
i
not
sick
but
sarge
sent
me
to
get
some
stuff

too
sick
to

awful

mornin

another
man
solemnly
pointing
over
his
shoulder
with
a
jerk
of
the
thumb
buried
yet

too
what
they
die
of
asked
fuselli
eagerly
spinal

in
a
man

of
the
line

fuselli

then

stiff
all
over
came
the
man
voice
from
the
end
of
the
line
there
was
a
silence
from
the
direction
of
the
infirmary
a
man
with
a
packet
of
medicines
in
his
hand
began
making
his
way
towards
the
door
many
guys
in
there
asked
fuselli
in
a
low
voice
as
the
man
brushed
past
him
when
the
door
closed
again
the
man
beside
fuselli
who
was
tall
and
broad
shouldered
with
heavy
black
eyebrows
burst
out
as
if
he
were
saying
something
he
been
trying
to
keep
from
saying
for
a
long
while
it
wo
be
right
if
that
sickness

me
indeed

wo
got
a
girl

for
me
at
home

two
years
since
i
ai
touched
a
woman
all
on
account
of
her
it
ai
natural
for
a
fellow
to
go
so
long
as
that
why
did
you
marry
her
before
you
left
somebody
asked
mockingly
said
she
did
want
to
be
no
war
bride
that
she
could
wait
for
me
better
if
i
several
men
laughed
it

be
right
if
i
took

an
died
of
this
sickness
after
keepin
myself
clean
on
account
of
that
girl

would
be

the
man
muttered
again
to
fuselli
fuselli
was
picturing
himself
lying
in
his
bunk
with
a
swollen
neck
while
his
arms
and
legs
stiffened
stiffened
a
man
half
way
up
the
passage
started
speaking
when
i
thinks
to
myself
how
much
the
folks
need
me
home
it
makes
me
feel
sort
o
i
dunno

checks

he
laughed
jovially
no

joined
in
the
laugh
is
it
awfully

asked
fuselli
of
the
man
next
him
most
catchin
thing
there
is
he
answered
solemnly
the
worst
of
it
is
another
man
was
muttering
in
a
shrill
hysterical
voice
thrown
over
to
the
sharks
gee
they
ai
got
a
right
to
do
that
even
if
it
is
war
time
they

cried
the
man
if
he
was
an
awficer

like
that
came
the
shrill
hysterical
voice
again
cut
that
said
someone
else

for
the
sake
of
but

so
near
where

fellers
are
with
that
sickness
whispered
fuselli
to
the
man
next
him
reckon
it
is
buddy
came
the
other
man
voice
dully
fuselli
started
making
his
way
toward
the
door
lem
me
out
fellers
i
got
to
puke
he
said
shoot
he
was
thinking
i
tell
the
place
was
closed
they
never
come
to
as
he
opened
the
door
he
thought
of
himself
crawling
back
to
his
bunk
and
feeling
his
neck
swell
and
his
hands
burn
with
fever
and
his
arms
and
legs
stiffen
until
everything
would
be
effaced
in
the
blackness
of
death
but
the
roar
of
the
wind
and
the
lash
of
the
spray
as
he
staggered
back
along
the
deck
drowned
all
other
thought
fuselli
and
another
man
carried
the
dripping
up
the
ladder
that
led
up
from
the
mess
hall
it
smelt
of
rancid
grease
and
coffee
grounds
and
greasy
juice
trickled
over
their
fingers
as
they
struggled
with
it
at
last
they
burst
out
on
to
the
deck
where
a
free
wind
blew
out
of
the
black
night
they
staggered
unsteadily
to
the
rail
and
emptied
the
pail
into
the
darkness
the
splash
was
lost
in
the
sound
of
the
waves
and
of
churned
water
fleeing
along
the
sides
fuselli
leaned
over
the
rail
and
looked
down
at
the
faint
phosphorescence
that
was
the
only
light
in
the
whole
black
gulf
he
had
never
seen
such
darkness
before
he
clutched
hold
of
the
rail
with
both
hands
feeling
lost
and
terrified
in
the
blackness
in
the
roaring
of
the
wind
in
his
ears
and
the
sound
of
churned
water
fleeing
astern
the
alternative
was
the
stench
of
below
decks
i
bring
down
the
rosie
do
you
bother
he
said
to
the
other
man
kicking
the
can
that
gave
out
a
ringing
sound
as
he
spoke
he
strained
his
eyes
to
make
out
something
the
darkness
seemed
to
press
in
upon
his
eyeballs
blinding
him
suddenly
he
noticed
voices
near
him
two
men
were
talking
i
ai
never
seen
the
sea
before
this
i
did
know
it
was
like

along
the
ship
side
and

wind

in
his
ears

stripes
on
the
cracked
panes
beating
a
hard
monotonous
tattoo
on
the
tin
roof
overhead
fuselli
had
taken
off
his
wet
slicker
and
stood
in
front
of
the
window
looking
out
dismally
at
the
rain
behind
him
was
the
smoking
stove
into
which
a
man
was
poking
wood
and
beyond
that
a
few
broken
folding
chairs
on
which
soldiers
sprawled
in
attitudes
of
utter
boredom
and
the
counter
where
the
y
man
stood
with
a
set
smile
doling
out
chocolate
to
a
line
of
men
that
filed
past
gee

have
to
line
up
for
everything
here
do

fuselli
muttered
that
about
all
you
do
do
in
this
buddy
said
a
man
beside
him
the
man
pointed
with
his
thumb
at
the
window
and
said
again

fuselli
slouched
over
to
the
end
of
the
line
and
stood
waiting
his
turn
he
was
thinking
of
the
steep
streets
of
san
francisco
and
the
glimpses
he
used
to
get
of
the
harbor
full
of
yellow
lights
the
color
of
amber
in
a
cigarette
holder
as
he
went
home
from
work
through
the
blue
dusk
he
had
begun
to
think
of
mabe
handing
him
the
box
of
candy
when
his
attention
was
distracted
by
the
talk
of
the
men
behind
him
the
man
next
to
him
was
speaking
with
hurried
nervous
intonation
fuselli
could
feel
his
breath
on
the
back
of
his
neck

tin
cup
up
with
chocolate

much
a
franc
one
of
those
looks
like

the
y
man
his
voice
full
of
amiable
condescension
that

hell
of
a
lot
for

cup
of
chauclate

the
stove
to
drink
the
chocolate
of
course
he
must
crab
he
was
in
the
war
now
if
the
sergeant
had
heard
him
crabbing
it
might
have
spoiled
his
chances
for

must
be
careful
if

toes

be
sure
to
get
it
and
why
ai

the
nervous
voice
of
the
man
who
had
stood
in
line
behind
fuselli
rose
to
a
sudden
shriek
everybody
looked
round
the
y
man
was
moving
his
head
from
side
to

in
a
flustered
way

the
man
was
yelling
at
the
top
of
his
lungs

had
hold
of
the
counter
with
two
hands
and
swayed
from
side
to

a
thin
straight
line

said
the
other
man
in
a
low
voice
ca
you
see
he
not
a
strange
terror
took
hold
of
fuselli
he
had
expected
things
to
be
like
that
when
he
had
sat
in
the
grandstand
in
the
training
camp
and
watched
the
jolly
soldiers
in
khaki
marching
into
towns
pursuing
terrified
huns
across
potato
fields
saving
belgian
against
picturesque
backgrounds
does
many
of
come
back

way
he
asked
a
man
beside
him
some
do

convalescent

man
and
his
friend
stood
side
by
side
near
the
stove

curiously

had
a
yellow
parchment
face
and
a
high
gaunt
forehead
going
up
to
sparse
curly
brown
hair
his
eyes
had
a
glassy
look
about
them
when
they
met
fuselli

smiled
amiably

they
went
out
into
the
slanting
rain
it
was
nearly
dark
but
the
sky
had
a
color
that
was
reflected
a
little
on
the
slanting
sides
of
tents
and
on
the
roofs
of
the
rows
of
sheds
that
disappeared
into
the
rainy
mist
in
every
direction
a
few
lights
gleamed
a
very
bright
polished
yellow
they
followed
a
that
splashed
mud
up
from
the
puddles
under
the
tramp
of
their
heavy
boots
at
one
place
they
flattened
themselves
against
the
wet
flap
of
a
tent
and
saluted
as
an
officer
passed
waving
a
little
cane
jauntily
how
long
does
a
fellow
usually
stay
in
these
rest
camps
asked
fuselli

bill
grey
and
fuselli
pooled
their
blankets
and
slept
together
they
lay
on
the
hard
floor
of
the
tent
very
close
to
each
other
listening
to
the
rain
pattering
endlessly
on
the
drenched
canvas

slanted
above
their
heads

fast
patter
of
the
rain
and
bill
grey
coughing
that
sergeant
gives
me
a
pain
in
the
neck
muttered
bill
grey
peevishly
when
his
coughing
had
stopped
wriggling
about
under
the
blankets
after
a
while
fuselli
said
in
a
very
low
voice
so
that
no
one
but
his
friend
should
hear
say
bill
ai
it
different
from
what
we
thought
it
was
going
to

grey
grandiloquently
hell
but
i
thought
it
be
excitin
like
in
the
i
guess
that
was
a
lot
o
fuselli
went
to
sleep
on
the
hard
floor
feeling
the
comfortable
warmth
of
grey
body
along
the
side
of
him
hearing
the
endless
monotonous
patter
of
the
rain
on
the
drenched
canvas
above
his
head
he
tried
to
stay
awake
a
minute
to
remember
what
mabe
looked
like
but
sleep
closed
down
on
him
suddenly
the
bugle
wrenched
them
out
of
their
blankets
before
it
was
light
it
was
not
raining
the
air
was
raw
and
full
of
white
mist
that
was
cold
as
snow
against
their
faces
still
warm
from
sleep
the
corporal
called
the
roll
lighting
matches
to
read
the
list
when
he
dismissed
the
formation
the
sergeant
voice
was
heard
from
the
tent
where
he
still
lay
rolled
in
his
blankets
say
corp
go
an
tell
fuselli
to
straighten
out
lieutenant
room
at
eight
sharp
in
officers
barracks
number
did
you
hear
fuselli
all
right
said
fuselli
his
blood
boiled
up
suddenly
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
to
do
servants
work
he
had
joined
the
army
to
be
a
slavey
to
any
damned
first
loot
it
was
against
army
regulations
anyway
he
go
and
kick
he
was
going
to
be
a
slavey
he
walked
towards
the
door
of
the
tent
thinking
what
he
say
to
the
sergeant
but
he
noticed
the
corporal
coughing
into
his
handkerchief
with
an
expression
of
pain
on
his
face
he
turned
and
strolled
away
it
would
get
him
in
wrong
if
he
started
kicking
like
that
much
better
shut
his
mouth
and
put
up
with
it
the
poor
old
corp
could
last
long
at
this
rate
no
it
would
do
to
get
in
wrong
at
eight
fuselli
with
a
broom
in
his
hand
feeling
dull
fury
pounding
and
fluttering
within
him
knocked
on
the
unpainted
board
door
who
that
to
clean
the
room
sir
said
fuselli
come
back
in
about
twenty
minutes
came
the
voice
of
the
lieutenant
all
right
fuselli
leaned
against
the
back
of
the
barracks
and
smoked
a
cigarette
the
air
stung
his
hands
as
if
they
had
been
scraped
by
a
twenty
minutes
passed
slowly
despair
seized
hold
of
him
he
was
so
far
from
anyone
who
cared
about
him
so
lost
in
the
vast
machine
he
was
telling
himself
that
he
never
get
on
would
never
get
up
where
he
could
show
what
he
was
good
for
he
felt
as
if
he
were
in
a
treadmill
day
after
day
it
would
be
like
this
the
same
routine
the
same
helplessness
he
looked
at
his
watch
minutes
had
passed
he
picked
up
his
broom
and
moved
round
to
the
lieutenant
room
come
in
said
the
lieutenant
carelessly
he
was
in
his
shirtsleeves
shaving
a
pleasant
smell
of
shaving
soap
filled
the
dark
clapboard
room
which
had
no
furniture
but
three
cots
and
some
officers
trunks
he
was
a
young
man
with
flabby
cheeks
and
dark
straight
eyebrows
he
had
taken
command
of
the
company
only
a
day
or
two
before
looks
like
a
decent
feller
thought
fuselli
what
your
name
asked
the
lieutenant
speaking
into
the
small
nickel
mirror
while
he
ran
the
safety
razor
obliquely
across
his
throat
he
stuttered
a
little
to
fuselli
he
seemed
to
speak
like
an
englishman
italian
parentage
i
presume
yes
said
fuselli
sullenly
dragging
one
of
the
cots
away
from
the
wall
parla
italiano
you
mean
do
i
speak
eyetalian
naw
sir
said
fuselli
emphatically
i
was
born
in
indeed
but
get
me
some
more
water
will
you
please
when
fuselli
came
back
he
stood
with
his
broom
between
his
knees
blowing
on
his
hands
that
were
blue
and
stiff
from
carrying
the
heavy
bucket
the
lieutenant
was
dressed
and
was
hooking
the
top
hook
of
the
uniform
carefully
the
collar
made
a
red
mark
on
his
pink
throat
all
right
when
you
through
report
back
to
the
the
lieutenant
went
out
drawing
on
a
pair
of
gloves
with
a
satisfied
and
important
gesture
fuselli
walked
back
slowly
to
the
tents
where
the
company
was
quartered
looking
about
him
at
the
long
lines
of
barracks
gaunt
and
dripping
in
the
mist
at
the
big
tin
sheds
of
the
cook
shacks
where
the
cooks
and
in
greasy
blue
denims
were
slouching
about
amid
a
steam
of
cooking
food
something
of
the
gesture
with
which
the
lieutenant
drew
on
his
gloves
caught
in
the
mind
of
fuselli
he
had
seen
peoople
make
gestures
like
that
in
the
movies
stout
dignified
people
in
evening
suits
the
president
of
the
company
that
owned
the
optical
goods
store
where
he
had
worked
at
home
in
frisco
had
had
something
of
that
gesture
about
him
and
he
pictured
himself
drawing
on
a
pair
of
gloves
that
way
importantly
finger
by
finger
with
a
little
wave
of
when
the
gesture
was
completed
he
have
to
get
that
corporalship
there
a
long
long
trail
through
no
man
land
in
the
company
sang
lustily
as
it
splashed
through
the
mud
down
a
grey
road
between
high
fences
covered
with
great
tangles
of
barbed
wire
above
which
peeked
the
ends
of
warehouses
and
the
chimneys
of
factories
the
lieutenant
and
the
top
sergeant
walked
side
by
side
chatting
now
and
then
singing
a
little
of
the
song
in
a
deprecating
way
the
corporal
sang
his
eyes
sparkling
with
delight
even
the
sombre
sergeant
who
rarely
spoke
to
anyone
sang
the
company
strode
along
its
legs
splashing
jauntily
through
the
deep
puddles
the
packs
swayed
merrily
from
side
to
side
as
if
it
were
they
and
not
the
legs
that
were
walking
there
a
long
long
trail
through
no
man
land
in
at
last
they
were
going
somewhere
they
had
separated
from
the
contingent
they
had
come
over
with
they
were
all
alone
now
they
were
going
to
be
put
to
work
the
lieutenant
strode
along
importantly
the
sergeant
strode
along
importantly
the
corporal
strode
along
importantly
the
right
guard
strode
along
more
importantly
than
anyone
a
sense
of
importance
of
something
tremendous
to
do
animated
the
company
like
wine
made
the
packs
and
the
belts
seem
less
heavy
made
their
necks
and
shoulders
less
stiff
from
struggling
with
the
weight
of
the
packs
made
the
legs
tramp
jauntily
in
spite
of
the
oozy
mud
and
the
deep
puddles
it
was
cold
in
the
dark
shed
of
the
freight
station
where
they
waited
some
gas
lamps
flickered
feebly
high
up
among
the
rafters
lighting
up
in
a
ghastly
way
white
piles
of
ammunition
boxes
and
ranks
and
ranks
of
shells
that
disappeared
in
the
darkness
the
raw
air
was
full
of
coal
smoke
and
a
smell
of
boards
the
captain
and
the
top
sergeant
had
disappeared
the
men
sat
about
huddled
in
groups
sinking
as
far
as
they
could
into
their
overcoats
stamping
their
numb
wet
feet
on
the
cement
of
the
floor
the
sliding
doors
were
shut
through
them
came
a
monotonous
sound
of
cars
shunting
of
buffers
bumping
against
buffers
and
now
and
then
the
shrill
whistle
of
an
engine
hell
the
french
railroads
are
rotten
said
someone
how
know
snapped
eisenstein
who
sat
on
a
box
away
from
the
rest
with
his
lean
face
in
his
hands
staring
at
his
boots
look
at
this
bill
grey
made
a
disgusted
gesture
towards
the
ceiling
gas
do
even
have
electric
their
trains
run
faster
than
ours
said
eisenstein
the
hell
they
do
why
a
fellow
back
in
that
rest
camp
told
me
that
it
took
four
or
five
days
to
get
he
was
stuffing

said
eisenstein
they
used
to
run
the
fastest

the
world

century
goddam
i
a
railroad
man

i
i

the
top

coming
suddenly
out
of
the
shadows
fuselli
grey
eisenstein
meadville
williams
all
right
come
say
sarge
this
guy
says
that
frog
trains

than

what
d

o
that
the
sergeant
put
on
his
comic
expression
everybody
got
ready
to
laugh
well
if
he
rather
take
the
pullmans
we
going
to
get
aboard
tonight
than
the
limited
he
welcome
i

everybody
laughed
the
top
sergeant
turned
confidentially
to
the
five
men
who
followed
him
into
a
small
room
that
looked
like
a
freight
office
we
got
to
sort
out
the
grub

three
days

understand
fuselli
pulled
open
one
of
the
boxes
the
cans
of
bully
beef
flew
under
his
fingers
he
kept
looking
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
at
eisenstein
who
seemed
very
skilful
in
a
careless
way
the
top
sergeant
stood
beaming
at
them
with
his
legs
wide
apart
once
he
said
something
in
a
low
voice
to
the
corporal
fuselli
thought
he
caught
the
words
privates
and
his
heart
started
thumping
hard
in
a
few
minutes
the
job
was
done
and
everybody
stood
about
lighting
cigarettes
well
fellers
said
sergeant
jones
the
sombre
man
who
rarely
spoke

on
the
back

night
sergeant
jones
and
i
have
got
to
be
with
the
lieutenant
understand
they
all
walked
back
to
the
dingy
room
where
the
rest
of
the
company
waited
huddled
in
their
coats
trying
to
keep
their
importance
from
being
too
obvious
in
their
step
i
really
started
now
thought
fuselli
to
himself
i
really
started
the
bare
freight
car
clattered
and
rumbled
monotonously
over
the
rails
a
bitter
cold
wind
blew
up
through
the
cracks
in
the
grimy
splintered
boards
of
the
floor
the
men
huddled
in
the
corners
of
the
car
curled
up
together
like
puppies
in
a
box
it
was
pitch
black
fuselli
lay
half
asleep
his
head
full
of
curious
fragmentary
dreams
feeling
through
his
sleep
the
aching
cold
and
the
unending
clattering
rumble
of
the
wheels
and
the
bodies
and
arms
and
legs
muffled
in
coats
and
blankets
pressing
against
him
he
woke
up
with
a
start
his
teeth
were
chattering
the
clanking
rumble
of
wheels
seemed
to
be
in
his
head
his
head
was
being
dragged
along
bumping
over
cold
iron
rails
someone
lighted
a
match
the
freight
car
black
swaying
walls
the
packs
piled
in
the
center
the
bodies
heaped
in
the
corners
where
out
of
khaki
masses
here
and
there
gleamed
an
occasional
white
face
or
a
pair
of
eyes
all
showed
clear
for
a
moment
and
then
vanished
again
in
the
utter
blackness
fuselli
pillowed
his
head
in
the
crook
of
someone
arm
and
tried
to
go
to
sleep
but
the
scraping
rumble
of
wheels
over
rails
was
too
loud
he
stayed
with
open
eyes
staring
into
the
blackness
trying
to
draw
his
body
away
from
the
blast
of
cold
air
that
blew
up
through
a
crack
in
the
floor
when
the
first
greyness
began
filtering
into
the
car
they
all
stood
up
and
stamped
and
pounded
each
other
and
wrestled
to
get
warm
when
it
was
nearly
light
the
train
stopped
and
they
opened
the
sliding
doors
they
were
in
a
station
a
station
where
the
walls
were
plastered
with
unfamiliar
advertisements
fuselli
spelt
out
the
name
versales
said
eisenstein
that
where
the
kings
of
france
used
to
the
train
started
moving
again
slowly
on
the
platform
stood
the
top
sergeant
how
d
sleep
he
shouted
as
the
car
passed
him
say
fuselli
better
start
some
grub
all
right
sarge
said
fuselli
the
sergeant
ran
back
to
the
front
of
the
car
and
climbed
on
with
a
delicious
feeling
of
leadership
fuselli
divided
up
the
bread
and
the
cans
of
bully
beef
and
the
cheese
then
he
sat
on
his
pack
eating
dry
bread
and
unsavoury
beef
whistling
joyfully
while
the
train
rumbled
and
clattered
along
through
a
strange
countryside
whistling
joyfully
because
he
was
going
to
the
front
where
there
would
be
glory
and
excitement
whistling
joyfully
because
he
felt
he
was
getting
along
in
the
world
it
was
noon
a
pallid
little
sun
like
a
toy
balloon
hung
low
in
the
sky
the
train
had
stopped
on
a
siding
in
the
middle
of
a
russet
plain
yellow
poplars
faint
as
mist
rose
slender
against
the
sky
along
a
black
shining
stream
that
swirled
beside
the
track
in
the
distance
a
steeple
and
a
few
red
roofs
were
etched
faintly
in
the
greyness
the
men
stood
about
balancing
first
on
one
foot
and
then
on
the
other
stamping
to
get
warm
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
an
old
man
with
an
oxcart
had
stopped
and
was
looking
sadly
at
the
train
say
where
the
front
somebody
shouted
to
him
everybody
took
up
the
cry
say
where
the
front
the
old
man
waved
his
hand
shook
his
head
and
shouted
to
the
oxen
the
oxen
took
up
again
their
quiet
processional
gait
and
the
old
man
walked
ahead
of
them
his
eyes
on
the
ground
say
ai
the
frogs
dumb
say
dan
said
bill
grey
strolling
away
from
a
group
of
men
he
had
been
talking
to
these
guys
say
we
are
going
to
the
third
say
fellers
shouted
fuselli
they
say

going
to
the
third
where
that
in
the
oregon
forest
ventured
somebody
that
at
the
front
ai
it
at
that
moment
the
lieutenant
strode
by
a
long
khaki
muffler
was
thrown
carelessly
round
his
neck
and
hung
down
his
back
look
here
men
he
said
severely
the
orders
are
to
stay
in
the
the
men
slunk
back
into
the
cars
sullenly
a
hospital
train
passed
clanking
slowly
over
the
fuselli
looked
fixedly
at
the
dark
enigmatic
windows
at
the
red
crosses
at
the
orderlies
in
white
who
leaned
out
of
the
doors
waving
their
hands
somebody
noticed
that
there
were
scars
on
the
new
green
paint
of
the
last
car
the
huns
have
been
shooting
at
d
hear
that
the
huns
tried
to
shoot
up
that
hospital
fuselli
remembered
the
pamphlet
german
atrocities
he
had
read
one
night
in
the
a
his
mind
became
suddenly
filled
with
pictures
of
children
with
their
arms
cut
off
of
babies
spitted
on
bayonets
of
women
strapped
on
tables
and
violated
by
soldier
after
soldier
he
thought
of
mabe
he
wished
he
were
in
a
combatant
service
he
wanted
to
fight
fight
he
pictured
himself
shooting
dozens
of
men
in
green
uniforms
and
he
thought
of
mabe
reading
about
it
in
the
papers
have
to
try
to
get
into
a
combatant
service
no
he
could
stay
in
the
medics
the
train
had
started
again
misty
russet
fields
slipped
by
and
dark
clumps
of
trees
that
gyrated
slowly
waving
branches
of
yellow
and
brown
leaves
and
patches
of
black
against
the
sky
fuselli
was
thinking
of
the
good
chance
he
had
of
getting
to
be
corporal
at
night
a
station
platform
the
company
waited
in
two
lines
each
man
sitting
on
his
pack
on
the
opposite
platform
crowds
of
little
men
in
blue
with
mustaches
and
long
soiled
overcoats
that
reached
almost
to
their
feet
were
shouting
and
singing
fuselli
watched
them
with
a
faint
disgust
gee
they
got
funny
lookin
helmets
ai
they
they
the
best
fighters
in
the
world
said
eisenstein

fuselli

excitedly

the
who

irishman

crushed
nose

the
middle
of
the
spat

fuselli
i
be
goddamned
if

somehow
said
bill
grey
squaring
his
jaw
a
fine
rain
was
falling
on
the
unprotected
platform
on
the
other
side
the
little
men
in
blue
were
singing
a
song
fuselli
could
not
understand
drinking
out
of
their
canteens
fuselli
announced
the
news
to
the
company
everybody
clustered
round
him
cursing
but
the
faint
sense
of
importance
it
gave
him
did
not
compensate
for
the
feeling
he
had
of
being
lost
in
the
machine
of
being
as
helpless
as
a
sheep
in
a
flock
hours
passed
they
stamped
about
the
platform
in
the
fine
rain
or
sat
in
a
row
on
their
packs
waiting
for
orders
a
grey
belt
appeared
behind
the
trees
the
platform
began
to
take
on
a
silvery
gleam
they
sat
in
a
row
on
their
packs
waiting
ii
the
company
stood
at
attention
lined
up
outside
of
their
barracks
a
long
wooden
shack
covered
with
tar
paper
in
front
of
them
was
a
row
of
dishevelled
plane
trees
with
white
trunks
that
looked
like
ivory
in
the
faint
ruddy
sunlight
then
there
was
a
rutted
road
on
which
stood
a
long
line
of
french
motor
trucks
with
hunched
grey
backs
like
elephants
beyond
these
were
more
plane
trees
and
another
row
of
barracks
covered
with
tar
paper
outside
of
which
other
companies
were
lined
up
standing
at
attention
a
bugle
was
sounding
far
away
the
lieutenant
stood
at
attention
very
stiffly
fuselli
eyes
followed
the
curves
of
his
puttees
up
to
the
braid
on
his
sleeves
parade
rest
shouted
the
lieutenant
in
a
muffled
voice
feet
and
hands
moved
in
unison
fuselli
was
thinking
of
the
town
after
retreat
you
could
go
down
the
irregular
cobbled
street
from
the
old
where
the
camp
was
to
a
little
square
where
there
was
a
grey
stone
fountain
and
a
where
you
could
sit
at
an
oak
table
and
have
beer
and
eggs
and
fried
potatoes
served
you
by
a
girl
with
red
cheeks
and
plump
white
appetizing
arms
attention
feet
and
hands
moved
in
unison
again
they
could
hardly
hear
the
bugle
it
was
so
faint
men
i
have
some
appointments
to
announce
said
the
lieutenant
facing
the
company
and
taking
on
an
easy
conversational
tone
at
rest
you
done
good
work
in
the
storehouse
here
men
i
glad
i
have
such
a
willing
bunch
of
men
under
me
and
i
certainly
hope
that
we
can
manage
to
make
as
many
promotions
as
possible
as
many
as
fuselli
hands
were
icy
and
his
heart
was
pumping
the
blood
so
fast
to
his
ears
that
he
could
hardly
hear
the
following
privates
to
private
read
the
lieutenant
in
a
routine
voice
grey
appleton
williams
eisenstein
porter
eisenstein
will
be
company
clerk
fuselli
was
almost
ready
to
cry
his
name
was
not
on
the
list
the
sergeant
voice
came
after
a
long

mellow
voice
the

full
of
soldiers
their
khaki
hid
the
worn
oak
benches
and
the
edges
of
the
square
tables
and
the
red
tiles
of
the

they
clustered
round
the
tables
where
glasses
and
bottles
gleamed
vaguely
through
the
tobacco
smoke
they
stood
in
front
of
the
bar
drinking
out
of
bottles
laughing
scraping
their
feet
on
the
floor
a
stout
girl
with
red
cheeks
and
plump
white
arms
moved
contentedly
among
them
carrying
away
empty
bottles
bringing
back
full
ones
taking
the
money
to
a
grim
old
woman
with
a
grey
face
and
eyes
like
bits
of
jet
who
stared
carefully
at

coin

it

grey
hands

of
a
cracked
mirror
that
seemed
a
window
into
another
dingier
room
the
paper

peeling
off
the
damp
walls
giving
a
mortuary
smell
of
mildewed
plaster

of

red
with
a
faint
swollen
look
she
looked
with
a
certain
defiance
at
the
men
who
stood
about
the
walls
and
sat
at
the
table
the
men
stared
at
her
silently
a
big
man
with
red
hair
and
a
heavy
jaw
who
sat
next
her
kept
edging
up
nearer
someone
knocked
against
the
table
making
the
bottles
and
liqueur
glasses
clustered
in
the
center
jingle
she
ai
clean
she
got
bobbed
hair
said
the
man
next
fuselli
the
woman
said
something
in
french
only
one
man
understood
it
his
laugh
rang
hollowly
in
the
silent
room
and
stopped
suddenly
the
woman
looked
attentively
at
the
faces
round
her
for
a
moment
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
began
straightening
the
ribbon
on
the
hat
she
held
on
her
lap
how
the
hell
did
she
get
here
i
thought
the
ran
them
out
of
town
the
minute
they
got
here
said
one
man
the
woman
continued
plucking
at
her
hat
you
venay
paris
said
a
boy
with
a
soft
voice
who
sat
near
her
he
had
blue
eyes
and
a
milky
complexion
faintly
tanned
that
went
strangely
with
the
rough
red
and
brown
faces
in
the
room
oui
de
paris
she
said
after
a
pause
glancing
suddenly
in
the
face
she
a
liar
i
can
tell
you
that
said
the
man
who
by
this
time
had
moved
his
chair
very
close
to
the
woman
you
told
him
you
came
from
marseilles
and
him
you
came
from
lyon
said
the
boy
with
the
milky
complexion
smiling
genially
vraiment
de
ou
venay
vous
i
come
from
everywhere
she
said
and
tossed
the
hair
back
from
her
face
travelled
a
lot
asked
the
boy
again
a
feller
told
me
said
fuselli
to
bill
grey
that
he
talked
to
a
girl
like
that
who
been
to
turkey
an
egypt
i
bet
that
girl
seen
some
the
woman
jumped
to
her
feet
suddenly
screaming
with
rage
the
man
with
the
red
hair
moved
away
sheepishly
then
he
lifted
his
large
dirty
hands
in
the
air
kamarad
he
said
nobody
laughed
the
room
was
silent
except
for
feet
scraping
occasionally
on
the
floor
she
put
her
hat
on
and
took
a
little
box
from
the
chain
bag
in
her
lap
and
began
powdering
her
face
making
faces
into
the
mirror
she
held
in
the
palm
of
her
hand
the
men
stared
at
her
guess
she
thinks
she
the
queen
of
the
may
said
one
man
getting
to
his
feet
he
leaned
across
the
table
and
spat
into
the
fireplace
going
back
to
he
turned
to
the
woman
and
shouted
in
a
voice
full
of
hatred
bon
the
woman
was
putting
the
powder
puff
away
in
her
jet
bag
she
did
not
look
up
the
door
closed
sharply
come
along
said
the
woman
suddenly
tossing
her
head
back
come
along
one
at
a
time
who
go
with
me
first
nobody
spoke
the
men
stared
at
her
silently
there
was
no
sound
except
that
of
feet
scraping
occasionally
on
the
floor
iii
the
oatmeal
flopped
heavily
into
the
fuselli
eyes
were
still
glued
together
with
sleep
he
sat
at
the
dark
greasy
bench
and
took
a
gulp
of
the
scalding
coffee
that
smelt
vaguely
of
dish
rags
that
woke
him
up
a
little
there
was
little
talk
in
the
mess
shack
the
men
that
the
bugle
had
wrenched
out
of
their
blankets
but
fifteen
minutes
before
sat
in
rows
eating
sullenly
or
blinking
at
each
other
through
the
misty
darkness
you
could
hear
feet
scraping
in
the
ashes
of
the
floor
and
mess
kits
clattering
against
the
tables
and
here
and
there
a
man
coughing
near
the
counter
where
the
food
was
served
out
one
of
the
cooks
swore
interminably
in
a
whiny
voice

thick
with

from
the
hundred
that
had
gone
before
in
front
of
the
shack
an
electric
light
illumined
faintly
the
wet
trunk
of
a
plane
tree
and
the
surface
of
the
water
where
bits
of
oatmeal
floated
and
coffee
grounds
and
the
garbage
pails
with
their
painted
signs
wet

the

let

they
lined
up
in
the
dark
road
feeling
the
mud
slopping
under
their
feet
the
ruts
were
full
of
black
water
in
which
gleamed
a
reflection
of
distant
electric
lights
all
you
fellows

in
storehouse

today
said
the
sergeant
who
had
been
a
preacher
in
his
sad
drawling
voice

says
that

be
finished
by

they
sending

to
the
front
somebody
let
his
breath
out
in
a
whistle
of
surprise
who
did
that
nobody
answered
dismissed
snapped
the
sergeant
disgustedly
they
straggled
off
into
the
darkness
towards
one
of
the
lights
their
feet
splashing
confusedly
in
the
puddles
fuselli
strolled
up
to
the
sentry
at
the
camp
gate
he
was
picking
his
teeth
meditatively
with
the
splinter
of
a
pine
board
say
phil
you
could
lend
me
a
half
a
dollar
could
you
fuselli
stopped
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
looked
at
the
sentry
with
the
splinter
sticking
out
of
a
corner
of
his
mouth
sorry
dan
said
the
other
man
i
cleaned
out
ai
had
a
cent
since
new
why
the
hell
do
they
pay
us
you
guys
signed
the
pay
roll
yet
sure
so
long
fuselli
strolled
on
down
the
dark
road
where
the
mud
was
frozen
into
deep
ruts
towards
the
town
it
was
still
strange
to
him
this
town
of
little
houses
faced
with
cracked
stucco
where
the
damp
made
grey
stains
and
green
stains
of
confused
roofs
and
of
narrow
cobbled
streets
that
zigzagged
in
and
out
among
high
walls
overhung
with
balconies
at
night
when
it
was
dark
except
for
where
a
lamp
in
a
window
spilt
gold
reflections
out
on
the
wet
street
or
the
light
streamed
out
from
a
store
or
a
cafe
it
was
almost
frighteningly
unreal
he
walked
down
into
the
main
square
where
he
could
hear
the
fountain
gurgling
in
the
middle
he
stopped
indecisively
his
coat
unbuttoned
his
hands
pushed
to
the
bottom
of
his
trousers
pockets
where
they
encountered
nothing
but
the
cloth
he
listened
a
long
time
to
the
gurgling
of
the
fountain
and
to
the
shunting
of
trains
far
away
in
the
freight
yards
an
this
is
the
war
he
thought
ai
it
queer
quieter
than
it
was
at
home
down
the
street
at
the
end
of
the
square
a
band
of
white
light
appeared
the
searchlight
of
a
staff
car
the
two
eyes
of
the
car
stared
straight
into
his
eyes
dazzling
him
then
veered
off
to
one
side
and
whizzed
past
leaving
a
faint
smell
of
gasoline
and
a
sound
of
voices
fuselli
watched
the
fronts
of
houses
light
up
as
the
car
made
its
way
to
the
main
road
then
the
town
was
dark
and
silent
again
he
strolled
across
the
square
towards
the
cheval
blanc
the
large
cafe
where
the
officers
went
button
yer
coat
came
a
gruff
voice
he
saw
a
stiff
tall
figure
at
the
edge
of
the
curve
he
made
out
the
shape
of
the
pistol
holster
that
hung
like
a
thin
ham
at
the
man
thigh
an
he
buttoned
his
coat
hurriedly
and
walked
off
with
rapid
steps
he
stopped
outside
a
cafe
that
had
ham
and
eggs
written
in
white
paint
on
the
window
and
looked
in
wistfully
someone
from
behind
him
put
two
big
hands
over
his
eyes
he
wriggled
his
head
free
hello

he
said
how

jug

trusty

said
cohan
i
fix

up
with
fuselli
followed
doubtfully
he
was
a
little
afraid
of
dan
cohan
he
remembered
how
a
man
had
been
last
week
for
trying
to
bolt
out
of
a
cafe
without
paying
for
his
drinks
he
sat
down
at
a
table
near
the
door
dan
had
disappeared
into
the
back
room
fuselli
felt
homesick
he
was
thinking
how
long
it
was
since
he
had
had
a
letter
from
mabe
i
bet
she
got
another
feller
he
told
himself
savagely
he
tried
to
remember
how
she
looked
but
he
had
to
take
out
his
watch
and
peep
in
the
back
before
he
could
make
out
if
her
nose
were
straight
or
snub
he
looked
up
clicking
the
watch
in
his
pocket
marie
of
the
white
arms
was
coming
laughing
out
of
the
inner
room
her
large
firm
breasts
neatly
held
in
by
the
blouse
shook
a
little
when
she
laughed
her
cheeks
were
very
red
and
a
strand
of
chestnut
hair
hung
down
along
her
neck
she
picked
it
up
hurriedly
and
caught
it
up
with
a
hairpin
walking
slowly
into
the
middle
of
the
room
as
she
did
so
with
her
hands
behind
her
head
dan
cohan
followed
her
into
the
room
a
broad
grin
on
his
face

down
before
a
dish
of
fried
eggs
at
the
table
in
the
corner
the
favoured
table
where
marie
herself
often
sat
and
chatted
when
wizened
madame
did
not
have
her
eye
upon
her
several
men
drew
up
their
chairs

of
apprehension
on

looked

kept
up
until
about
noon
the
next
day
when
the
orderlies
strangled
the
feller
got
their
goat
i
fuselli
was
looking
towards
the
other
side
of
the
room
where
a
faint
murmur
of
righteous
indignation
was
rising
from
the
dark
man
with
the
unshaven
jaw
and
his
companions
fuselli
was
thinking
that
it
good
to
be
seen
round
too
much
with
a
fellow
like
cohan
who
talked
about
the
germans
notifying
hospitals
before
they
bombarded
them
and
who
was
waiting
for
a
might
get
him
in
wrong
he
slipped
out
of
the
cafe
into
the
dark
a
dank
wind
blew
down
the
irregular
street
ruffling
the
reflected
light
in
the
puddles
making
a
shutter
bang
interminably
somewhere
fuselli
went
to
the
main
square
again
casting
an
envious
glance
in
the
window
of
the
cheval
blanc
where
he
saw
officers
playing
billiards
in
a
room
painted
white
and
gold
and
a
blond
girl
in
a
shirtwaist
enthroned
haughtily
behind
the
bar
he
remembered
the
and
automatically
hastened
his
steps
in
a
narrow
street
the
other
side
of
the
square
he
stopped
before
the
window
of
a
small
grocery
shop
and
peered
inside
keeping
carefully
out
of
the
oblong
of
light
that
showed
faintly
the
cobbles
and
the
green
and
grey
walls
opposite
a
girl
sat
knitting
beside
the
small
counter
with
her
two
little
black
feet
placed
demurely
side
by
side
on
the
edge
of
a
box
full
of
red
beets
she
was
very
small
and
slender
the
lamplight
gleamed
on
her
black
hair
done
close
to
her
head
her
face
was
in
the
shadow
several
soldiers
lounged
awkwardly
against
the
counter
and
the
jambs
of
the
door
following
her
movements
with
their
eyes
as
dogs
watch
a
plate
of
meat
being
moved
about
in
a
kitchen
after
a
little
the
girl
rolled
up
her
knitting
and
jumped
to
her
feet
showing
her
face
an
oval
white
face
with
large
dark
lashes
and
an
impertinent
mouth
she
stood
looking
at
the
soldiers
who
stood
about
her
in
a
circle
then
twisted
up
her
mouth
in
a
grimace
and
disappeared
into
the
inner
room
fuselli
walked
to
the
end
of
the
street
where
there
was
a
bridge
over
a
small
stream
he
leaned
on
the
cold
stone
rail
and
looked
into
the
water
that
was
barely
visible
gurgling
beneath
between
rims
of
ice
o
this
is
a
hell
of
a
life
he
muttered
he
shivered
in
the
cold
wind
but
remained
leaning
over
the
water
in
the
distance
trains
rumbled
interminably
giving
him
a
sense
of
vast
desolate
distances
the
village
clock
struck
eight
the
bell
had
a
soft
note
like
the
bass
string
of
a
guitar
in
the
darkness
fuselli
could
almost
see
the
girl
face
grimacing
with
its
broad
impertinent
lips
he
thought
of
the
sombre
barracks
and
men
sitting
about
on
the
end
of
their
cots
hell
he
could
go
back
yet
his
whole
body
was
taut
with
desire
for
warmth
and
softness
and
quiet
he
slouched
back
along
the
narrow
street
cursing
in
a
dismal
monotone
before
the
grocery
store
he
stopped
the
men
had
gone
he
went
in
jauntily
pushing
his
cap
a
little
to
one
side
so
that
some
of
his
thick
curly
hair
came
out
over
his
forehead
the
little
bell
in
the
door
clanged
the
girl
came
out
of
the
inner
room
she
gave
him
her
hand
indifferently
comment
ca
va
yvonne
bon
his
made
her
show
her
little
pearly
teeth
in
a
smile
good
she
said
in
english
they
laughed
childishly
say
will
you
be
my
girl
yvonne
she
looked
in
his
eyes
and
laughed
non
compris
she
said
we
we
voulez
vous
et
ma
fille
she
shrieked
with
laughter
and
slapped
him
hard
on
the
cheek
venez
she
said
still
laughing
he
followed
her
in
the
inner
room
was
a
large
oak
table
with
chairs
round
it
at
the
end
eisenstein
and
a
french
soldier
were
talking
excitedly
so
absorbed
in
what
they
were
saying
that
they
did
not
notice
the
other
two
yvonne
took
the
frenchman
by
the
hair
and
pulled
his
head
back
and
told
him
still
laughing
what
fuselli
had
said
he
laughed
no
you
must
not
say
that
he
said
in
english
turning
to
fuselli
fuselli
was
angry
and
sat
down
sullenly
at
the
end
of
the
table
keeping
his
eyes
on
yvonne
she
drew
the
knitting
out
of
the
pocket
of
her
apron
and
holding
it
up
comically
between
two
fingers
glanced
towards
the
dark
corner
of
the
room
where
an
old
woman
with
a
lace
cap
on
her
head
sat
asleep
and
then
let
herself
fall
into
a
chair
boom
she
said
fuselli
laughed
until
the
tears
filled
his
eyes
she
laughed
too
they
sat
a
long
while
looking
at
each
other
and
giggling
while
eisenstein
and
the
frenchman
talked
suddenly
fuselli
caught
a
phrase
that
startled
him
what
would
you
americans
do
if
revolution
broke
out
in
france
we
do
what
we
were
ordered
to
said
eisenstein
bitterly
we
a
bunch
of
fuselli
noticed
that
eisenstein
puffy
sallow
face
was
flushed
and
that
there
was
a
flash
in
his
eyes
he
had
never
seen
before
how
do
you
mean
revolution
asked
fuselli
in
a
puzzled
voice
the
frenchman
turned
black
eyes
searchingly
upon
him
i
mean
stop
the
butchery
overthrow
the
capitalist
the
social
but
you
a
republic
already
ai
yer
as
much
as
you
you
talk
like
a
socialist
said
fuselli
they
tell
me
they
shoot
guys
in
america
for
talkin
like
you
see
said
eisenstein
to
the
frenchman
are
they
all
like
that
except
a
very
few
it
hopeless
said
eisenstein
burying
his
face
in
his
hands
i
often
think
of
shooting
better
shoot
someone
else
said
the
frenchman
it
will
be
more
fuselli
stirred
uneasily
in
his
chair
where
you
fellers
get
that
stuff
anyway
he
asked
in
his
mind
he
was
saying
a
kike
and
a
frog
that
a
good
his
eye
caught
yvonne
and
they
both
laughed
yvonne
threw
her
knitting
ball
at
him
it
rolled
down
under
the
table
and
they
both
scrambled
about
under
the
chairs
looking
for
it
twice
i
have
thought
it
was
going
to
happen
said
the
frenchman
when
was
that
a
little
while
ago
a
division
started
marching
on
paris
and
when
i
was
in
verdun
o
there
will
be
a
revolution
france
is
the
country
of
we
always
be
here
to
shoot
you
down
said
eisenstein
wait
till
you
been
in
the
war
a
little
while
a
winter
in
the
trenches
will
make
any
army
ready
for
but
we
have
no
way
of
learning
the
truth
and
in
the
tyranny
of
the
army
a
man
becomes
a
brute
a
piece
of
machinery
remember
you
are
freer
than
we
are
we
are
worse
than
the
russians
it
is
curious
o
but
you
must
have
some
feeling
of
civilization
i
have
always
heard
that
americans
were
free
and
independent
will
they
let
themselves
be
driven
to
the
slaughter
always
o
i
do
eisenstein
got
to
his
feet
we
better
be
getting
to
barracks
coming
fuselli
he
said
guess
so
said
fuselli
indifferently
without
getting
up
eisenstein
and
the
frenchman
went
out
into
the
shop
bon
swar
said
fuselli
softly
leaning
across
the
table
hey
girlie
he
threw
himself
on
his
belly
on
the
wide
table
and
put
his
arms
round
her
neck
and
kissed
her
feeling
everything
go
blank
in
a
flame
of
desire
she
pushed
him
away
calmly
with
strong
little
arms
stop
she
said
and
jerked
her
head
in
the
direction
of
the
old
woman
in
the
chair
in
the
dark
corner
of
the
room
they
stood
side
by
side
listening
to
her
faint
wheezy
snoring
he
put
his
arms
round
her
and
kissed
her
long
on
the
mouth
demain
he
said
she
nodded
her
head
fuselli
walked
fast
up
the
dark
street
towards
the
camp
the
blood
pounded
happily
through
his
veins
he
caught
up
with
eisenstein
say
eisenstein
he
said
in
a
comradely
voice
i
do
think
you
ought
to
go
talking
round
like
that
you
get
yourself
in
too
deep
one
of
these
i
do
care
but
hell
man
you
do
want
to
get
in
the
wrong
that
bad
they
shoot
fellers
for
less
than
you
let
christ
man
you
do
want
to
be
a
damn
fool
expostulated
fuselli
how
old
are
you
fuselli
i
twenty
i
thirty
i
lived
more
kid
i
know
what
good
and
what
bad
this
butchery
makes
me
god
i
know
it
a
hell
of
a
note
but
who
brought
it
on
if
somebody
had
shot
that
eisenstein
laughed
bitterly
at
the
entrance
of
camp
fuselli
lingered
a
moment
watching
the
small
form
of
eisenstein
disappear
with
its
curious
waddly
walk
into
the
darkness
i
going
to
be
damn
careful
who
i
seen
goin
into
barracks
with
he
said
to
himself
that
damn
kike
may
be
a
german
spy
or
a
a
cold
chill
of
terror
went
over
him
shattering
his
mood
of
joyous
his
feet
slopped
in
the
puddles
breaking
through
the
thin
ice
as
he
walked
up
the
road
towards
the
barracks
he
felt
as
if
people
were
watching
him
from
everywhere
out
of
the
darkness
as
if
some
gigantic
figure
were
driving
him
forward
through
the
darkness
holding
a
fist
over
his
head
ready
to
crush
him
when
he
was
rolled
up
in
his
blankets
in
the
bunk
next
to
bill
grey
he
whispered
to
his
friend
say
bill
i
think
i
got
a
skirt
all
fixed
up
in
who
yvonne
do
tell
bill
grey
whistled
softly
you
some
highflyer
fuselli
chuckled
hell
man
the
best
ai
good
enough
for
well
i
going
to
leave
you
said
bill
grey
when
damn
soon
i
ca
go
this
life
i
do
see
how
you
fuselli
did
not
answer
he
snuggled
warmly
into
his
blankets
thinking
of
yvonne
and
the
corporalship
in
the
light
of
the
one
flickering
lamp
that
made
an
unsteady
circle
of
reddish
glow
on
the
station
platform
fuselli
looked
at
his
pass
from
reveille
on
february
fourth
to
reveille
on
february
fifth
he
was
a
free
man
his
eyes
smarted
with
sleep
as
he
walked
up
and
down
the
cold
station
platform
for
hours
he
would
have
to
obey
anybody
orders
despite
the
loneliness
of
going
away
on
a
train
in
a
night
like
this
in
a
strange
country
fuselli
was
happy
he
clinked
the
money
in
his
pocket
down
the
track
a
red
eye
appeared
and
grew
nearer
he
could
hear
the
hard
puffing
of
the
engine
up
the
grade
huge
curves
gleamed
as
the
engine
roared
slowly
past
him
a
man
with
bare
arms
black
with
coal
dust
was
leaning
out
of
the
cab
lit
up
from
behind
by
a
yellowish
red
glare
now
the
cars
were
going
by
flat
cars
with
guns
tilted
up
like
the
muzzles
of
hunting
dogs
freight
cars
out
of
which
here
and
there
peered
a
man
head
the
train
almost
came
to
a
stop
the
cars
clanged
one
against
the
other
all
down
the
train
fuselli
was
looking
into
a
pair
of
eyes
that
shone
in
the
lamplight
a
hand
was
held
out
to
him
so
long
kid
said
a
boyish
voice
i
do
know
who
the
hell
you
are
but
so
long
good
so
long
stammered
fuselli
going
to
the
front
yer
goddam
right
answered
another
voice
the
train
took
up
speed
again
the
clanging
of
car
against
car
ceased
and
in
a
moment
they
were
moving
fast
before
fuselli
eyes
then
the
station
was
dark
and
empty
again
and
he
was
watching
the
red
light
grow
smaller
and
paler
while
the
train
rumbled
on
into
the
darkness
a
confusion
of
gold
and
green
and
crimson
silks
and
intricate
designs
of
naked
cupids
filled
fuselli
mind
when
full
of
wonder
he
walked
down
the
steps
of
the
palace
out
into
the
faint
ruddy
sunlight
of
the
afternoon
a
few
names
napoleon
josephine
the
empire
that
had
never
had
significance
in
his
mind
before
flared
with
a
lurid
gorgeous
light
in
his
imagination
like
a
tableau
of
living
statues
at
a
vaudeville
theatre
they
must
have
had
a
heap
of
money
them
guys
said
the
man
who
was
with
him
a
private
in
aviation
let
go
have
a
fuselli
was
silent
and
absorbed
in
his
thoughts
here
was
something
that
supplemented
his
visions
of
wealth
and
glory
that
he
used
to
tell
al
about
when
they
sit
and
watch
the
big
liners
come
in
all
glittering
with
lights
through
the
golden
gate
they
did
mind
having
naked
women
about
did
they
said
the
private
in
aviation
a
morose
little
man
who
had
been
in
the
woolen
business
d
blame
them
no
i
ca
say
i
do
i
bet
they
was
immoral
them
guys
he
continued
vaguely
they
wandered
about
the
streets
of
fontainebleau
listlessly
looking
into
shop
windows
staring
at
women
lolling
on
benches
in
the
parks
where
the
faint
sunlight
came
through
a
lacework
of
twigs
purple
and
crimson
and
yellow
that
cast
intricate
shadows
on
the
asphalt
let
go
have
another
drink
said
the
private
in
aviation
fuselli
looked
at
his
watch
they
had
hours
before
train
time
a
girl
in
a
loose
dirty
blouse
wiped
off
the
table
vin
blank
said
the
other
man
mame
shows
said
fuselli
his
head
was
full
of
gold
and
green
mouldings
and
silk
and
crimson
velvet
and
intricate
designs
in
which
naked
cupids
writhed
indecently
some
day
he
was
saying
to
himself
he
make
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
money
and
live
in
a
house
like
that
with
mabe
no
with
yvonne
or
with
some
other
girl
must
have
been
immoral
them
guys
said
the
private
in
aviation
leering
at
the
girl
in
the
dirty
blouse
fuselli
remembered
a
revel
he
seen
in
a
moving
picture
of
quo
vadis
people
in
bath
robes
dancing
around
with
large
cups
in
their
hands
and
tables
full
of
dishes
being
upset
cognac
beaucoup
said
the
private
in
aviation
mame
shows
said
fuselli
the
cafe
was
full
of
gold
and
green
silks
and
great
brocaded
beds
with
heavy
carvings
above
them
beds
in
which
writhed
and
indecent
intricate
patterns
of
cupids
somebody
said
hello
he
was
on
the
train
his
ears
hummed
and
his
head
had
an
iron
band
round
it
it
was
dark
except
for
the
little
light
that
flickered
in
the
ceiling
for
a
minute
he
thought
it
was
a
goldfish
in
a
bowl
but
it
was
a
light
that
flickered
in
the
ceiling
hello
fuselli
said
eisenstein
feel
all
right
sure
said
fuselli
with
a
thick
voice
why
should
i
how
did
you
find
that
house
said
eisenstein
seriously
hell
i
do
know
muttered
fuselli
i
goin
to
his
mind
was
a
jumble
he
remembered
vast
halls
full
of
green
and
gold
silks
and
great
beds
with
crowns
over
them
where
napoleon
and
josephine
used
to
sleep
who
were
they
o
yes
the
empire
or
was
it
the
abdication
then
there
were
patterns
of
flowers
and
fruits
and
cupids
all
gilded
and
a
dark
passage
and
stairs
that
smelt
musty
where
he
and
the
man
in
aviation
fell
down
he
remembered
how
it
felt
to
rub
his
nose
hard
on
the
gritty
red
plush
carpet
of
the
stairs
then
there
were
women
in
skirts
standing
about
or
were
those
the
pictures
on
the
walls
and
there
was
a
bed
with
mirrors
round
it
he
opened
his
eyes
eisenstein
was
talking
to
him
he
must
have
been
talking
to
him
for
some
time
i
look
at
it
this
way
he
was
saying
a
feller
needs
a
little
of
that
to
keep
healthy
now
if
he
abstemious
and
careful
fuselli
went
to
sleep
he
woke
up
again
thinking
suddenly
he
must
borrow
that
little
blue
book
of
army
regulations
it
would
be
useful
to
know
that
in
case
something
came
up
the
corporal
who
had
been
in
the
red
sox
outfield
had
been
transferred
to
a
base
hospital
it
was
so
sergeant

eisenstein

muttered
fuselli
composing
himself
to
sleep
again
the
bugle
wrenched
fuselli
out
of
his
blankets
half
dead
with
sleep
say
bill
i
got
a
head
again
he
muttered
there
was
no
answer
it
was
only
then
that
he
noticed
that
the
cot
next
to
his
was
empty
the
blankets
were
folded
neatly
at
the
foot
sudden
panic
seized
him
he
could
get
along
without
bill
grey
he
said
to
himself
he
have
anyone
to
go
round
with
he
looked
fixedly
at
the
empty
cot
attention
the
company
was
lined
up
in
the
dark
with
their
feet
in
the
mud
puddles
of
the
road
the
lieutenant
strode
up
and
down
in
front
of
them
with
the
tail
of
his
trench
coat
sticking
out
behind
he
had
a
pocket
flashlight
that
he
kept
flashing
at
the
gaunt
trunks
of
trees
in
the
faces
of
the
company
at
his
feet
in
the
puddles
of
the
road
if
any
man
knows
anything
about
the
whereabouts
of
private
william
grey
report
at
once
as
otherwise
we
shall
have
to
put
him
down
you
know
what
that
means
the
lieutenant
spoke
in
short
shrill
periods
chopping
off
the
ends
of
his
words
as
if
with
a
hatchet
no
one
said
anything
i
guess
he
this
from
someone
behind
fuselli
and
i
have
one
more
announcement
to
make
men
said
the
lieutenant
in
his
natural
voice
i
going
to
appoint
fuselli
private
acting
fuselli
knees
were
weak
under
him
he
felt
like
shouting
and
dancing
with
joy
he
was
glad
it
was
dark
so
that
no
one
could
see
how
excited
he
was
sergeant
dismiss
the
company
said
the
lieutenant
bringing
his
voice
back
to
its
military
tone
companee
said
out
the
sergeant
jovially
in
groups
talking
with
crisp
voices
cheered
by
the
occurrence
of
events
the
company
straggled
across
the
great
stretch
of
mud
puddles
towards
the
mess
shack
iv
yvonne
tossed
the
omelette
in
the
air
it
landed
sizzling
in
the
pan
again
and
she
came
forward
into
the
light
holding
the
frying
pan
before
her
behind
her
was
the
dark
stove
and
above
it
a
row
of
copper
kettles
that
gleamed
through
the
bluish
obscurity
she
flicked
the
omelette
out
of
the
pan
into
the
white
dish
that
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
table
full
in
the
yellow
lamplight
tiens
she
said
brushing
a
few
stray
hairs
off
her
forehead
with
the
back
of
her
hand
you
some
cook
said
fuselli
getting
to
his
feet
he
had
been
sprawling
on
a
chair
in
the
other
end
of
the
kitchen
watching
slender
body
in
tight
black
dress
and
blue
apron
move
in
and
out
of
the
area
of
light
as
she
got
dinner
ready
a
smell
of
burnt
butter
with
a
faint
tang
of
pepper
in
it
filled
the
kitchen
making
his
mouth
water
this
is
the
real
stuff
he
was
saying
to
himself
like
he
stood
with
his
hands
deep
in
his
pockets
and
his
head
thrown
back
watching
her
cut
the
bread
holding
the
big
loaf
to
her
chest
and
pulling
the
knife
towards
her
she
brushed
some
crumbs
off
her
dress
with
a
thin
white
hand
you
my
girl
yvonne
ai
yer
fuselli
put
his
arms
round
her
sale
bete
she
said
laughing
and
pushing
him
away
there
was
a
brisk
step
outside
and
another
girl
came
into
the
kitchen
a
thin
girl
with
a
sharp
nose
and
long
teeth
ma
cousine
mon
they
both
laughed
fuselli
blushed
as
he
shook
the
girl
hand
il
est
beau
hein
said
yvonne
gruffly
mais
ma
petite
il
est
charmant
vot
americain
they
laughed
again
fuselli
who
did
not
understand
laughed
too
thinking
to
himself
they
let
the
dinner
get
cold
if
they
do
sit
down
get
maman
dan
said
yvonne
fuselli
went
into
the
shop
through
the
room
with
the
long
oak
table
in
the
dim
light
that
came
from
the
kitchen
he
saw
the
old
woman
white
bonnet
her
face
was
in
shadow
but
there
was
a
faint
gleam
of
light
in
her
small
beady
eyes
supper
he
shouted
grumbling
in
her
creaky
little
voice
the
old
woman
followed
him
back
into
the
kitchen
steam
gilded
by
the
lamplight
rose
in
pillars
to
the
ceiling
from
the
big
tureen
of
soup
there
was
a
white
cloth
on
the
table
and
a
big
loaf
of
bread
at
the
end
the
plates
with
borders
of
little
roses
on
them
seemed
after
the
army
mess
the
most
beautiful
things
fuselli
had
ever
seen
the
wine
bottle
was
black
beside
the
soup
tureen
and
the
wine
in
the
glasses
cast
a
dark
purple
stain
on
the
cloth
fuselli
ate
his
soup
silently
understanding
very
little
of
the
french
that
the
two
girls
rattled
at
each
other
the
old
woman
rarely
spoke
and
when
she
did
one
of
the
girls
would
throw
her
a
hasty
remark
that
hardly
interrupted
their
chatter
fuselli
was
thinking
of
the
other
men
lining
up
outside
the
dark
mess
shack
and
the
sound
the
food
made
when
it
flopped
into
the
mess
kits
an
idea
came
to
him
he
have
to
bring
sarge
to
see
yvonne
they
could
set
him
up
to
a
feed
it
would
help
me
to
stay
in
good
with
him
he
had
a
minute
worry
about
his
corporalship
he
was
acting
corporal
right
enough
but
he
wanted
them
to
send
in
his
appointment
the
omelette
melted
in
his
mouth
damn
bon
he
said
to
yvonne
with
his
mouth
full
she
looked
at
him
fixedly
bon
bon
he
said
again
you
dan
bon
she
said
and
laughed
the
cousin
was
looking
from
one
to
the
other
enviously
her
upper
lip
lifted
away
from
her
teeth
in
a
smile
the
old
woman
munched
her
bread
in
a
silent
preoccupied
fashion
there
somebody
in
the
store
said
fuselli
after
a
long
pause
je
he
put
his
napkin
down
and
went
out
wiping
his
mouth
on
the
back
of
his
hand
eisenstein
and
a
boy
were
in
the
shop
hullo
are
you
keepin
house
here
asked
eisenstein
sure
said
fuselli
conceitedly
have
you
got
any
chawclit
asked
the
boy
in
a
thin
bloodless
voice
fuselli
looked
round
the
shelves
and
threw
a
cake
of
chocolate
down
on
the
counter
anything
else
nothing
thank
you
corporal
how
much
is
it
whistling
there
a
long
long
trail
fuselli
strode
back
into
the
inner
room
combien
chocolate
he
asked
when
he
had
received
the
money
he
sat
down
at
his
place
at
table
again
smiling
importantly
he
must
write
al
about
all
this
he
was
thinking
and
he
was
wondering
vaguely
whether
al
had
been
drafted
yet
after
dinner
the
women
sat
a
long
time
chatting
over
their
coffee
while
fuselli
squirmed
uneasily
on
his
chair
looking
now
and
then
at
his
watch
his
pass
was
till
twelve
only
it
was
already
getting
on
to
ten
he
tried
to
catch
yvonne
eye
but
she
was
moving
about
the
kitchen
putting
things
in
order
for
the
night
and
hardly
seemed
to
notice
him
at
last
the
old
woman
shuffled
into
the
shop
and
there
was
the
sound
of
a
key
clicking
hard
in
the
outside
door
when
she
came
back
fuselli
said
to
everyone
and
left
by
the
back
door
into
the
court
there
he
leaned
sulkily
against
the
wall
and
waited
in
the
dark
listening
to
the
sounds
that
came
from
the
house
he
could
see
shadows
passing
across
the
orange
square
of
light
the
window
threw
on
the
cobbles
of
the
court
a
light
went
on
in
an
upper
window
sending
a
faint
glow
over
the
disorderly
tiles
of
the
roof
of
the
shed
opposite
the
door
opened
and
yvonne
and
her
cousin
stood
on
the
broad
stone
doorstep
chattering
fuselli
had
pushed
himself
in
behind
a
big
hogshead
that
had
a
pleasant
tang
of
old
wood
damp
with
sour
wine
at
last
the
heads
of
the
shadows
on
the
cobbles
came
together
for
a
moment
and
the
cousin
clattered
across
the
court
and
out
into
the
empty
streets
her
rapid
footsteps
died
away
yvonne
shadow
was
still
in
the
door
dan
she
said
softly
fuselli
came
out
from
behind
the
hogshead
his
whole
body
flushing
with
delight
yvonne
pointed
to
his
shoes
he
took
them
off
and
left
them
beside
the
door
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
a
quarter
to
eleven
viens
she
said
he
followed
her
his
knees
trembling
a
little
from
excitement
up
the
steep
stairs
the
deep
broken
strokes
of
the
town
clock
had
just
begun
to
strike
midnight
when
fuselli
hurried
in
the
camp
gate
he
gave
up
his
pass
jauntily
to
the
guard
and
strolled
towards
his
barracks
the
long
shed
was
pitch
black
full
of
a
sound
of
deep
breathing
and
of
occasional
snoring
there
was
a
thick
smell
of
uniform
wool
on
which
the
sweat
had
dried
fuselli
undressed
without
haste
stretching
his
arms
luxuriously
he
wriggled
into
his
blankets
feeling
cool
and
tired
and
went
to
sleep
with
a
smile
of
on
his
lips
the
companies
were
lined
up
for
retreat
standing
stiff
as
toy
soldiers
outside
their
barracks
the
evening
was
almost
warm
a
little
playful
wind
oozing
with
springtime
played
with
the
swollen
buds
on
the
plane
trees
the
sky
was
a
drowsy
violet
color
and
the
blood
pumped
hot
and
stinging
through
the
stiffened
arms
and
legs
of
the
soldiers
who
stood
at
attention
the
voices
of
the
were
particularly
harsh
and
metallic
this
evening
it
was
rumoured
that
a
general
was
about
orders
were
shouted
with
fury
standing
behind
the
line
of
his
company
fuselli
chest
was
stuck
out
until
the
buttons
of
his
tunic
were
in
danger
of
snapping
off
his
shoes
were
and
he
wore
a
new
pair
of
puttees
wound
so
tightly
that
his
legs
ached
at
last
the
bugle
sounded
across
the
silent
camp
parade
rest
shouted
the
lieutenant
fuselli
mind
was
full
of
the
army
regulations
which
he
had
been
studying
assiduously
for
the
last
week
he
was
thinking
of
an
imaginary
examination
for
the
corporalship
which
he
would
pass
of
course
when
the
company
was
dismissed
he
went
up
familiarly
to
the
top
sergeant

said
the
top
sergeant
it
all
made
out
he
added
encouragingly
they
walked
towards
the
town
silently

evening

old

were
lighted

deep
cushions

said
the
top
sergeant
in
his
voice
they
had
reached
the
square
they
saluted
stiffly
as
two
officers
brushed
past
them
what
the
regulations
about
a
feller
marryin
a
french
girl
broke
out
fuselli
suddenly
thinking
of
getting
hitched
up

of
the
grocery
shop
fuselli
peered
in
through
the
window
the
shop
was
full
of
soldiers
lounging
against
the
counter
and
the
walls
in
the
midst
of
them
demurely
knitting

hand
on
fuselli

he
said
then
he
added
jovially
well
let
go
see
that
girl
of
they
went
out
into
the
dark
streets
where
the
wind
despite
the
smell
of
burnt
gasolene
and
army
camps
had
a
faint
suavity
something
like
the
smell
of
mushrooms
the
smell
of
spring
yvonne
sat
under
the
lamp
in
the
shop
her
feet
up
on
a
box
of
canned
peas
yawning
dismally
behind
her
on
the
counter
was
the
glass
case
full
of
yellow
and
cheeses
above
that
shelves
rose
to
the
ceiling
in
the
brownish
obscurity
of
the
shop
where
gleamed
faintly
large
jars
and
small
jars
cans
neatly
placed
in
rows
glass
jars
and
vegetables
in
the
corner
near
the
glass
curtained
door
that
led
to
the
inner
room
hung
clusters
of
sausages
large
and
small
red
yellow
and
speckled
yvonne
jumped
up
when
fuselli
and
the
sergeant
opened
the
door

she
said
je

laughed

the
top
sergeant
knowingly
this

sarjon
yvonne
said
fuselli
oui
oui
je

said
yvonne
smiling
at
the
top
sergeant
they
sat
in
the
little
room
behind
the
shop
and
drank
white
wine
and
talked
as
best
they
could
to
yvonne
who
very
trim
in
her
black
dress
and
blue
apron
perched
on
the
edge
of
her
chair
with
her
feet
in
tiny
pumps
pressed
tightly
together
and
glanced
now
and
then
at
the
elaborate
stripes
on
the
top
sergeant
arm
fuselli
strode
familiarly
into
the
grocery
shop
whistling
and
threw
open
the
door
to
the
inner
room
his
whistling
stopped
in
the
middle
of
a
bar
hello
he
said
in
an
annoyed
voice
hello
corporal
said
eisenstein
eisenstein
his
french
soldier
friend
a
lanky
man
with
a
scraggly
black
heard
and
burning
black
eyes
and
stockton
the
boy
were
sitting
at
the
table
that
filled
up
the
room
chatting
intimately
and
gaily
with
yvonne
who
leaned
against
the
yellow
wall
beside
the
frenchman
and
showed
all
her
little
pearly
teeth
in
a
laugh
in
the
middle
of
the
dark
oak
table
was
a
pot
of
hyacinths
and
some
glasses
that
had
had
wine
in
them
the
odor
of
the
hyacinths
hung
in
the
air
with
a
faint
warm
smell
from
the
kitchen
after
a
second
hesitation
fuselli
sat
down
to
wait
until
the
others
should
leave
it
was
long
after
and
his
pockets
were
empty
so
he
had
nowhere
else
to
go
how
are
they
treatin
you
down
in
your
outfit
now
asked
eisenstein
of
stockton
after
a
silence
same
as
ever
said
stockton
in
his
thin
voice
stuttering
a
little
sometimes

curious
expression
of
understanding
on
his
flabby
face

an

he
put
his
hand
on
stockton
shoulder
the
boy
winced
and
drew
his
chair
away
what
for
you
do
that
i
ai

to

said
eisenstein
fuselli
looked
at
them
both
with
a
disgusted
interest
i
tell
you
what
you
better
do
kid
he
said
condescendingly
you
get
transferred
to
our
company
it
an
al

eisenstein
we
got
a
good
loot
an
a
good
an
a
damn
good
bunch
our
was
in
here
a
few
minutes
ago
said
eisenstein
he
was
asked
fuselli
where
he
go
damned
if
i
yvonne
and
the
french
soldier
were
talking
in
low
voices
laughing
a
little
now
and
then
fuselli
leaned
back
in
his
chair
looking
at
them
feeling
out
of
things
wishing
despondently
that
he
knew
enough
french
to
understand
what
they
were
saying
he
scraped
his
feet
angrily
back
and
forth
on
the
floor
his
eyes
lit
on
the
white
hyacinths
they
made
him
think
of
florists
windows
at
home
at
eastertime
and
the
noise
and
bustle
of
san
francisco
streets
god
i
hate
this
rotten
hole
he
muttered
to
himself
he
thought
of
mabe
he
made
a
noise
with
his
lips
hell
she
was
married
by
this
time
anyway
yvonne
was
the
girl
for
him
if
he
could
only
have
yvonne
to
himself
far
away
somewhere
away
from
the
other
men
and
that
damn
frog
and
her
old
mother
he
thought
of
himself
going
to
the
theatre
with
yvonne
when
he
was
a
sergeant
he
would
be
able
to
afford
that
sort
of
thing
he
counted
up
the
months
it
was
march
here
he
been
in
europe
five
months
and
he
was
still
only
a
corporal
and
not
that
yet
he
clenched
his
fists
with
impatience
but
once
he
got
to
be
a
it
would
go
faster
he
told
himself
reassuringly
he
leaned
over
and
sniffed
loudly
at
the
hyacinths
they
smell
good
he
said
que
disay
vous
yvonne
yvonne
looked
at
him
as
if
she
had
forgotten
that
he
was
in
the
room
her
eyes
looked
straight
into
his
and
she
burst
out
laughing
her
glance
had
made
him
feel
warm
all
over
and
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
again
looking
at
her
slender
body
so
neatly
cased
in
its
black
dress
and
at
her
little
head
with
its
hair
with
a
comfortable
feeling
of
possession
yvonne
come
over
here
he
said
beckoning
with
his
head
she
looked
from
him
to
the
frenchman
provocatively
then
she
came
over
and
stood
behind
him
que
fuselli
glanced
at
eisenstein
he
and
stockton
were
deep
in
excited
conversation
with
the
frenchman
again
fuselli
heard
that
uncomfortable
word
that
always
made
him
angry
he
did
not
know
why
yvonne
he
said
so
that
only
she
could
hear
what
you
say
you
and
me
get
married
marries
moi
et
toi
asked
yvonne
in
a
puzzled
voice
we
she
looked
him
in
the
eyes
a
moment
and
then
threw
hack
her
head
in
a
paroxysm
of
hysterical
laughter
fuselli
flushed
scarlet
got
to
his
feet
and
strode
out
slamming
the
door
behind
him
so
that
the
glass
rang
he
walked
hurriedly
back
to
camp
splashed
with
mud
by
the
long
lines
of
grey
motor
trucks
that
were
throbbing
their
way
slowly
through
the
main
street
each
with
a
yellow
eye
that
lit
up
faintly
the
tailboards
of
the
truck
ahead
the
barracks
were
dark
and
nearly
empty
he
sat
down
at
the
sergeant
desk
and
began
moodily
turning
over
the
pages
of
the
little
blue
book
of
army
regulations
the
moonlight
glittered
in
the
fountain
at
the
end
of
the
main
square
of
the
town
it
was
a
warm
dark
night
of
faint
clouds
through
which
the
moon
shone
palely
as
through
a
thin
silk
canopy
fuselli
stood
by
the
fountain
smoking
a
cigarette
looking
at
the
yellow
windows
of
the
cheval
blanc
at
the
other
end
of
the
square
from
which
came
a
sound
of
voices
and
of
billiard
balls
clinking
he
stood
quiet
letting
the
acrid
cigarette
smoke
drift
out
through
his
nose
his
ears
full
of
the
silvery
tinkle
of
the
water
in
the
fountain
beside
him
there
were
little
drifts
of
warm
and
chilly
air
in
the
breeze
that
blew
fitfully
from
the
west
fuselli
was
waiting
he
took
out
his
watch
now
and
then
and
strained
his
eyes
to
see
the
time
but
there
was
not
light
enough
at
last
the
deep
broken
note
of
the
bell
in
the
church
spire
struck
once
it
must
be
half
past
ten
he
started
walking
slowly
towards
the
street
where
yvonne
grocery
shop
was
the
faint
glow
of
the
moon
lit
up
the
grey
houses
with
the
shuttered
windows
and
tumultuous
red
roofs
full
of
little
dormers
and
skylights
fuselli
felt
deliciously
at
ease
with
the
world
he
could
almost
feel
yvonne
body
in
his
arms
and
he
smiled
as
he
remembered
the
little
faces
she
used
to
make
at
him
he
slunk
past
the
shuttered
windows
of
the
shop
and
dove
into
the
darkness
under
the
arch
that
led
to
the
court
he
walked
cautiously
on
tiptoe
keeping
close
to
the
wall
for
he
heard
voices
in
the
court
he
peeped
round
the
edge
of
the
building
and
saw
that
there
were
several
people
in
the
kitchen
door
talking
he
drew
his
head
back
into
the
shadow
but
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
dark
round
form
of
the
hogshead
beside
the
kitchen
door
if
he
only
could
get
behind
that
as
he
usually
did
he
would
be
hidden
until
the
people
went
away
keeping
well
in
the
shadow
round
the
edge
of
the
court
he
slipped
to
the
other
side
and
was
just
about
to
pop
himself
in
behind
the
hogshead
when
he
noticed
that
someone
was
there
before
him
he
caught
his
breath
and
stood
still
his
heart
thumping
the
figure
turned
and
in
the
dark
he
recognised
the
top
sergeant
round
face
keep
quiet
ca
you
whispered
the
top
sergeant
peevishly
fuselli
stood
still
with
his
fists
clenched
the
blood
flamed
through
his
head
making
his
scalp
tingle
still
the
top
sergeant
was
the
top
sergeant
came
the
thought
it
would
never
do
to
get
in
wrong
with
him
fuselli
legs
moved
him
automatically
back
into
a
corner
of
the
court
where
he
leaned
against
the
damp
wall
glaring
with
smarting
eyes
at
the
two
women
who
stood
talking
outside
the
kitchen
door
and
at
the
dark
shadow
behind
the
hogshead
at
last
after
several
smacking
kisses
the
women
went
away
and
the
kitchen
door
closed
the
bell
in
the
church
spire
struck
eleven
slowly
and
mournfully
when
it
had
ceased
striking
fuselli
heard
a
discreet
tapping
and
saw
the
shadow
of
the
top
sergeant
against
the
door
as
he
slipped
in
fuselli
heard
the
top
sergeant
voice
in
a
large
stage
whisper
followed
by
a
choked
laugh
from
yvonne
the
door
closed
and
the
light
was
extinguished
leaving
the
court
in
darkness
except
for
a
faint
marbled
glow
in
the
sky
fuselli
strode
out
making
as
much
noise
as
he
could
with
his
heels
on
the
cobble
stones
the
streets
of
the
town
were
silent
under
the
pale
moon
in
the
square
the
fountain
sounded
loud
and
metallic
he
gave
up
his
pass
to
the
guard
and
strode
glumly
towards
the
barracks
at
the
door
he
met
a
man
with
a
pack
on
his
back
hullo
fuselli
said
a
voice

fuselli
v
meadville
stood
near
the
camp
gate
watching
the
motor
trucks
go
by
on
the
main
road
grey
lumbering
and
they
throbbed
by
sloughing
in
and
out
of
the
mud
holes
in
the
worn
road
in
an
endless
train
stretching
as
far
as
he
could
see
into
the
town
and
as
far
as
he
could
see
up
the
road
he
stood
with
his
legs
far
apart
and
spat
into
the
center
of
the
road
then
he
turned
to
the
corporal
who
had
been
in
the
red
sox
outfield
and
said

said
the
corporal
wo
get
home
a
bit
hell
but
you
a
another
train
of
motor
trucks
went
by
drowning
their
talk
fuselli
was
packing
medical
supplies
in
a
box
in
a
great
brownish
warehouse
full
of
packing
cases
where
a
little
sun
filtered
in
through
the
dusty
air
at
the
corrugated
sliding
tin
doors
as
he
worked
he
listened
to
daniels
talking
to
meadville
who
worked
beside
him
an
the
gas
is
the
goddamndest
stuff
i
ever
heard
of
he
was
saying
i
seen
fellers
with
their
arms
swelled
up
to
twice
the
size
like
blisters
from
it
mustard
gas
they
call
what
did
you
get
to
go
to
the
hospital
said
meadville
only
pneumonia
said
daniels
but
i
had
a
buddy
who
was
split
right
in
half
by
a
piece
of
a
shell
he
was
standin
as
near
me
as
you
are
was
whistlin
under
his
breath
when
all
at
once
there
was
a
big
spurt
o
blood
an
there
he
was
with
his
chest
split
in
half
an
his
head
hangin
a
thread
meadville
moved
his
quid
of
tobacco
from
one
cheek
to
the
other
and
spat
on
to
the
sawdust
of
the
floor
the
men
within
earshot
stopped
working
and
looked
admiringly
at
daniels
well
what
d
reckon
goin
on
at
the
front
now
said
meadville
damned
of
i
know
the
goddam
hospital
at
orleans
was
so
full
up
there
was
guys
in
stretchers
waiting
all
day
on
the
pavement
outside
i
know
that
fellers
there
said
hell
broke
loose
for
fair
looks
to
me
like
the
fritzies
was
meadville
looked
at
him
incredulously
those
skunks
said
fuselli
why
they
ca
advance
they
to
the
hell
they
are
said
daniels
i
guess
you
believe
everything
you
see
in
the
eyes
looked
at
daniels
indignantly
they
all
went
on
working
in
silence
suddenly
the
lieutenant
looking
strangely
flustered
strode
into
the
warehouse
leaving
the
tin
door
open
behind
him
can
anyone
tell
me
where
sergeant
osler
is
he
was
here
a
few
minutes
ago
spoke
up
fuselli
well
where
is
he
now
snapped
the
lieutenant
angrily
i
do
know
sir
mumbled
fuselli
flushing
go
and
see
if
you
can
find
fuselli
went
off
to
the
other
end
of
the
warehouse
outside
the
door
he
stopped
and
bit
off
a
cigarette
in
a
leisurely
fashion
his
blood
boiled
sullenly
how
the
hell
should
he
know
where
the
top
sergeant
was
they
did
expect
him
to
be
a
did
they
and
all
the
flood
of
bitterness
that
had
been
collecting
in
his
spirit
seethed
to
the
surface
they
had
not
treated
him
right
he
felt
full
of
hopeless
anger
against
this
vast
treadmill
to
which
he
was
bound
the
endless
succession
of
the
days
all
alike
all
subject
to
orders
to
the
interminable
monotony
of
drills
and
passed
before
his
mind
he
felt
he
could
go
on
yet
he
knew
that
he
must
and
would
go
on
that
there
was
no
stopping
that
his
feet
would
go
on
beating
in
time
to
the
steps
of
the
treadmill
he
caught
sight
of
the
sergeant
coming
towards
the
warehouse
across
the
new
green
grass
scarred
by
the
marks
of
truck
wheels
sarge
he
called
then
he
went
up
to
him
mysteriously
the
loot
wants
to
see
you
at
once
in
warehouse
he
slouched
back
to
his
work
arriving
just
in
time
to
hear
the
lieutenant
say
in
a
severe
voice
to
the
sergeant
sergeant
do
you
know
how
to
draw
up
papers
yes
sir
said
the
sergeant
a
look
of
surprise
on
his
face
he
followed
the
precise
steps
of
the
lieutenant
out
of
the
door
fuselli
had
a
moment
of
panic
terror
during
which
he
went
on
working
methodically
although
his
hands
trembled
he
was
searching
his
memory
for
some
infringement
of
a
regulation
that
might
be
charged
against
him
the
terror
passed
as
fast
as
it
had
come
of
course
he
had
no
reason
to
fear
he
laughed
softly
to
himself
what
a
fool
he
been
to
get
scared
like
that
and
a
summary
could
do
much
to
you
anyway
he
went
on
working
as
fast
and
as
carefully
as
he
could
through
the
long
monotonous
afternoon
that
night
nearly
the
whole
company
gathered
in
a
group
at
the
end
of
the
barracks
both
sergeants
were
away
the
corporal
said
he
knew
nothing
and
got
sulkily
into
bed
where
he
lay
rolled
in
his
blankets
shaken
by
fit
after
fit
of
coughing
at
last
someone
said
i
bet
that
kike
eisenstein
turned
out
to
be
a

the

angrily
the
barracks

full
of
a
sound
of
men
undressing
in
their
bunks
and
of
whispered
talk
the
company
was
lined
up
for
morning
mess
the
sun
that
had
just
risen
was
shining
in
rosily
through
the
soft
clouds
of
the
sky
the
sparrows
kept
up
a
great
clattering
in
the
avenue
of
plane
trees
their
riotous
chirping
could
be
heard
above
the
sound
of
motors
starting
that
came
from
a
shed
opposite
the
mess
shack
the
sergeant
appeared
suddenly
walking
past
with
his
shoulders
stiff
so
that
everyone
knew
at
once
that
something
important
was
going
on
attention
men
a
minute
he
said
mess
kits
clattered
as
the
men
turned
round
after
mess
i
want
you
to
go
immediately
to
barracks
and
roll
your
packs
after
that
every
man
must
stand
by
his
pack
until
orders
the
company
cheered
and
mess
kits
clattered
together
like
cymbals
as
you
were
shouted
the
top
sergeant
jovially
gluey
oatmeal
and
greasy
bacon
were
hurriedly
bolted
down
and
every
man
in
the
company
his
heart
pounding
ran
to
the
barracks
to
do
up
his
pack
feeling
proud
under
the
envious
eyes
of
the
company
at
the
other
end
of
the
shack
that
had
received
no
orders
when
the
packs
were
done
up
they
sat
on
the
empty
hunks
and
drummed
their
feet
against
the
wooden
partitions
waiting
i
do
suppose
we
leave
here
till
hell
freezes
over
said
meadville
who
was
doing
up
the
last
strap
on
his
pack
it
always
like
this
you
break
your
neck
to
obey
orders
an
outside
shouted
the
sergeant
poking
his
head
in
the
door
fall
in
the
lieutenant
in
his
trench
coat
and
in
a
new
pair
of
roll
puttees
stood
facing
the
company
looking
solemn
men
he
said
biting
off
his
words
as
a
man
bites
through
a
piece
of
hard
stick
candy
one
of
your
number
is
up
for
courtmartial
for
possibly
disloyal
statements
found
in
a
letter
addressed
to
friends
at
home
i
have
been
extremely
grieved
to
find
anything
of
this
sort
in
any
company
of
mine
i
do
believe
there
is
another
man
in
the
company
low
enough
to
hold
entertain
such
ideas
every
man
in
the
company
stuck
out
his
chest
vowing
inwardly
to
entertain
no
ideas
at
all
rather
than
run
the
risk
of
calling
forth
such
disapproval
from
the
lieutenant
the
lieutenant
paused
all
i
can
say
is
if
there
is
any
such
man
in
the
company
he
had
better
keep
his
mouth
shut
and
be
pretty
damn
careful
what
he
writes
home
dismissed
he
shouted
the
order
grimly
as
if
it
were
the
order
for
the
execution
of
the
offender
that
goddam
skunk
eisenstein
said
someone
the
lieutenant
heard
it
as
he
walked
away
oh
sergeant
he
said
familiarly
i
think
the
others
have
got
the
right
stuff
in
the
company
went
into
the
barracks
and
waited
the
office
was
full
of
a
clicking
of
typewriters
and
was
overheated
by
a
black
stove
that
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
letting
out
occasional
little
puffs
of
smoke
from
a
crack
in
the
stove
pipe
the
was
a
small
man
with
a
fresh
boyish
face
and
a
drawling
voice
who
lolled
behind
a
large
typewriter
reading
a
magazine
that
lay
on
his
lap
fuselli
slipped
in
behind
the
typewriter
and
stood
with
his
cap
in
his
hand
beside
the
chair
well
what
do
you
want
asked
the
gruffly
a
feller
told
me
that
you
was
for
a
man
with
optical
experience
fuselli
voice
was
velvety
well
i
worked
three
years
in
an
store
at
home
in
what
your
name

daniel
fuselli
private
company
c

but
all
right
out
with
what
you

to
say
the
fingered
the
leaves
of
his
magazine
impatiently
my
company
all
packed
up
to
go
the
transfer
have
to
be
today
why
the
hell
did
you
come
in
earlier
stevens
make
out
a
transfer
to
headquarters
company
and
get
the
major
to
sign
it
when
he
goes
through
that
the
way
it
always
is
he
cried
leaning
back
tragically
in
his
swivel
chair
everybody
always
puts
everything
off
on
me
at
the
last
thank
you
sir
said
fuselli
smiling
the
ran
his
hand
through
his
hair
and
took
up
his
magazine
again
peevishly
fuselli
hurried
back
to
barracks
where
he
found
the
company
still
waiting
several
men
were
crouched
in
a
circle
playing
craps
the
rest
lounged
in
their
bare
bunks
or
fiddled
with
their
packs
outside
it
had
begun
to
rain
softly
and
a
smell
of
wet
sprouting
earth
came
in
through
the
open
door
fuselli
sat
on
the
floor
beside
his
bunk
throwing
his
knife
down
so
that
it
stuck
in
the
boards
between
his
knees
he
was
whistling
softly
to
himself
the
day
dragged
on
several
times
he
heard
the
town
clock
strike
in
the
distance
at
last
the
top
sergeant
came
in
shaking
the
water
off
his
slicker
a
serious
important
expression
on
his
face
inspection
of
medical
belts
he
shouted
everybody
open
up
their
belt
and
lay
it
on
the
foot
of
their
bunk
and
stand
at
attention
on
the
left
the
lieutenant
and
a
major
appeared
suddenly
at
one
end
of
the
barracks
and
came
through
slowly
pulling
the
little
packets
out
of
the
belts
the
men
looked
at
them
out
of
the
corners
of
their
eyes
as
they
examined
the
belts
they
chatted
easily
as
if
they
had
been
alone
yes
said
the
major
we
in
for
it
this
time
that
damned
well
we
be
able
to
show
what
we
good
for
said
the
lieutenant
laughing
we
have
had
a
chance
hum
better
mark
that
belt
lieutenant
and
have
it
changed
been
to
the
front
yet
no
hum
well
you
look
at
things
differently
when
you
have
said
the
major
the
lieutenant
frowned
well
on
the
whole
lieutenant
your
outfit
is
in
very
good
shape
at
ease
men
the
lieutenant
and
the
major
stood
at
the
door
a
moment
raising
the
collars
of
their
coats
then
they
dove
out
into
the
rain
a
few
minutes
later
the
sergeant
came
in
all
right
get
your
slickers
on
and
line
they
stood
lined
up
in
the
rain
for
a
long
while
it
was
a
leaden
afternoon
the
even
clouds
had
a
faint
coppery
tinge
the
rain
beat
in
their
faces
making
them
tingle
fuselli
was
looking
anxiously
at
the
sergeant
at
last
the
lieutenant
appeared
attention
cried
the
sergeant
the
roll
was
called
and
a
new
man
fell
in
at
the
end
of
the
line
a
tall
man
with
large
protruding
eyes
like
a
calf
private
daniel
fuselli
fall
out
and
report
to
headquarters
company
fuselli
saw
a
look
of
surprise
come
over
men
faces
he
smiled
wanly
at
meadville
sergeant
take
the
men
down
to
the
squads
right
cried
the
sergeant
march
the
company
tramped
off
into
the
streaming
rain
fuselli
went
back
to
the
barracks
took
off
his
pack
and
slicker
and
wiped
the
water
off
his
face
the
rails
gleamed
gold
in
the
early
morning
sunshine
above
the
deep
purple
cinders
of
the
track
fuselli
eyes
followed
the
track
until
it
curved
into
a
cutting
where
the
wet
clay
was
a
bright
orange
in
the
clear
light
the
station
platform
where
puddles
from
the
night
rain
glittered
as
the
wind
ruffled
them
was
empty
fuselli
started
walking
up
and
down
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
he
had
been
sent
down
to
unload
some
supplies
that
were
coming
on
that
morning
train
he
felt
free
and
successful
since
he
joined
the
headquarters
company
at
last
he
told
himself
he
had
a
job
where
he
could
show
what
he
was
good
for
he
walked
up
and
down
whistling
shrilly
a
train
pulled
slowly
into
the
station
the
engine
stopped
to
take
water
and
the
couplings
clanked
all
down
the
line
of
cars
the
platform
was
suddenly
full
of
men
in
khaki
stamping
their
feet
running
up
and
down
shouting
where
you
guys
goin
asked
fuselli
we
bound
for
palm
beach
do
we
look
it
someone
snarled
in
reply
but
fuselli
had
seen
a
familiar
face
he
was
shaking
hands
with
two
browned
men
whose
faces
were
grimy
with
days
of
travelling
in
freight
cars
hullo
chrisfield
hullo
andrews
he
cried
when
did
you
fellows
get
over
here
oh
four
months
ago
said
chrisfield
whose
black
eyes
looked
at
fuselli
searchingly
oh
ah

you
fuselli
we
was
at
trainin
camp
together
him
andy
sure
said
andrews
how
are
you
makin
out

said
fuselli
i
in
the
optical
department
where
the
hell
that
right
fuselli
pointed
vaguely
behind
the
station
we
been
training
about
four
months
near
bordeaux
said
andrews
and
now
we
going
to
see
what
it
the
whistle
blew
and
the
engine
started
puffing
hard
clouds
of
white
steam
filled
the
station
platform
where
the
soldiers
scampered
for
their
cars
good
luck
said
fuselli
but
andrews
and
chrisfield
had
already
gone
he
saw
them
again
as
the
train
pulled
out
two
brown
and
faces
among
many
other
brown
and
faces
the
steam
floated
up
tinged
with
yellow
in
the
bright
early
morning
air
as
the
last
car
of
the
train
disappeared
round
the
curve
into
the
cutting
the
dust
rose
thickly
about
the
worn
broom
as
it
was
a
dark
morning
very
little
light
filtered
into
the
room
full
of
great
white
packing
cases
where
fuselli
was
sweeping
he
stopped
now
and
then
and
leaned
on
his
broom
far
away
he
heard
a
sound
of
trains
shunting
and
shouts
and
the
sound
of
feet
tramping
in
unison
from
the
drill
ground
the
building
where
he
was
was
silent
he
went
on
sweeping
thinking
of
his
company
tramping
off
through
the
streaming
rain
and
of
those
fellows
he
had
known
in
training
camp
in
america
andrews
and
chrisfield
jolting
in
box
cars
towards
the
front
where
daniel
buddy
had
had
his
chest
split
in
half
by
a
piece
of
shell
and
he
written
home
he
been
made
a
corporal
what
was
he
going
to
do
when
letters
came
for
him
addressed
corporal
dan
fuselli
putting
the
broom
away
he
dusted
the
yellow
chair
and
the
table
covered
with
order
slips
that
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
piles
of
packing
boxes
the
door
slammed
somewhere
below
and
there
was
a
step
on
the
stairs
that
led
to
the
upper
part
of
the
warehouse
a
little
man
with
a
face
and
spectacles
appeared
and
slipped
out
of
his
overcoat
like
a
very
small
bean
popping
out
of
a
very
large
pod
the
sergeant
stripes
looked
unusually
wide
and
conspicuous
on
his
thin
arm
he
grunted
at
fuselli
sat
down
at
the
desk
and
began
at
once
peering
among
the
order
slips
anything
in
our
mailbox
this
morning
he
asked
fuselli
in
a
hoarse
voice
it
all
there
sergeant
said
fuselli
the
sergeant
peered
about
the
desk
some
more
ye
have
to
wash
that
window
today
he
said
after
a
pause
major
likely
to
come
round
here
any
time
ought
to
have
been
done
all
right
said
fuselli
dully
he
slouched
over
to
the
corner
of
the
room
got
the
worn
broom
and
began
sweeping
down
the
stairs
the
dust
rose
about
him
making
him
cough
he
stopped
and
leaned
on
the
broom
he
thought
of
all
the
days
that
had
gone
by
since
he
last
seen
those
fellows
andrews
and
chrisfield
at
training
camp
in
america
and
of
all
the
days
that
would
go
by
he
started
sweeping
again
sweeping
the
dust
down
from
stair
to
stair
fuselli
sat
on
the
end
of
his
bunk
he
had
just
shaved
it
was
a
sunday
morning
and
he
looked
forward
to
having
the
afternoon
off
he
rubbed
his
face
on
his
towel
and
got
to
his
feet
outside
the
rain
fell
in
great
silvery
sheets
so
that
the
noise
on
the
tarpaper
roof
of
the
barracks
was
almost
deafening
fuselli
noticed
at
the
other
end
of
the
row
of
bunks
a
group
of
men
who
all
seemed
to
be
looking
at
the
same
thing
rolling
down
his
sleeves
with
his
tunic
hitched
over
one
arm
he
walked
down
to
see
what
was
the
matter
through
the
patter
of
the
rain
he
heard
a
thin
voice
say
it
ai

the
sergeant
he
was
a
big
man
with
black
hair
who
looked
like
a
lumberman

stood
over
the
bunk
in
the
bunk
at
the
end
of
a
bundle
of
blankets

the
face

and
fell
over
his
chest

said
to
a
man
at
the

of
the

window
at
the
bright
sheets

fields
and
the
misty
woods
slipped
by
slowly
as
the
box
car
rumbled
and
jolted
over
the
rails
now
stopping
for
hours
on
sidings
amid
meadows
where
it
was
quiet
and
where
above
the
babel
of
voices
of
the
regiment
you
could
hear
the
skylarks
now
clattering
fast
over
bridges
and
along
the
banks
of
rivers
where
the
slim
poplars
were
just
coming
into
leaf
and
where
now
and
then
a
fish
jumped
the
men
crowded
in
the
door
grimy
and
tired
leaning
on
each
other
shoulders
and
watching
the
plowed
lands
slip
by
and
the
meadows
where
the
grass
was
dappled
with
buttercups
and
the
villages
of
huddled
red
roofs
lost
among
pale
budding
trees
and
masses
of
peach
blossom
through
the
smells
of
steam
and
coal
smoke
and
of
unwashed
bodies
in
uniforms
came
smells
of
moist
fields
and
of
manure
from
patches
and
of
cows
and
pasture
lands
just
coming
into
flower

be
right

judkins
poking
his
head
out
between
andrews
and
chrisfield
heads
so
that
the
bristles
of
his
unshaven
chin
rubbed
against
chrisfield
cheek
it
was
a
large
square
head
with
closely
cropped
light
hair
and
eyes
under
lids
that
showed
white
in
the
red
sunburned
face
and
a
square
jaw
made
a
little
grey
by
the
sprouting
beard

said
andrews
it
was
a
day
of
fluffy
clouds
that
moved
across
the
sky
sometimes
darkening
to
deep
blue
where
a
small
rainstorm
trailed
across
the
hills
sometimes
brightening
to
moments
of
clear
sunlight
that
gave
blue
shadows
to
the
poplars
and
shone
yellow
on
the
smoke
of
the
engine
that
puffed
on
painfully
at
the
head
of
the
long
train
funny
ai
it
how
everythin
is
said
chrisfield
out
indiana
way
we
would
look

bet
i
they
were
going
into
the
suburbs
of
a
town
rows
and
clusters
of
little
brick
and
stucco
houses
were
appearing
along
the
roads
it
began
to
rain
from
a
sky
full
of
lights
of
amber
and
lilac
color
the
slate
roofs
and
the
streets
of
the
town
shone
cheerfully
in
the
rain
the
little
patches
of
garden
were
all
vivid
then
they
were
looking
at
rows
and
rows
of
red
chimney
pots
over
wet
slate
roofs
that
reflected
the
bright
sky
in
the
distance
rose
the
spire
of
a
church
and
the
irregular
forms
of
old
buildings
they
passed
through
a
station
dijon
read
andrews
on
the
platform
were
french
soldiers
in
their
blue
coats
and
a
good
sprinkling
of
civilians
gee

are
about
the
first
real
civies
i

since

came
overseas
said
judkins
those
goddam
country
people
down
at
polignac
did
look
like
real
civilians
there
folks
dressed
like
it
was
new
they
had
left
the
station
and
were
rumbling
slowly
past
interminable
freight
trains
at
last
the
train
came
to
a
dead
stop
a
whistle
sounded
do
nobody
get
out
shouted
the
sergeant
from
the
car
ahead
hell
they
keep
you
in
this
goddam
car
like
you

a
convict
muttered
chrisfield

a
bee
line

among
those
goddam
frogs
no
vin
blank
is
all
get
in
that
goddam
ah
goin
to
sleep
said
chrisfield
he
stretched
himself
out
on
the
pile
of
equipment
at
the
end
of
the
car
andrews
sat
down
near
him
and
stared
at
his
boots
running
one
of
his
long
hands
as
brown
as
chrisfield
now
through
his
light
hair
chrisfield
lay
looking
at
the
gaunt
outline
of
andrews
face
against
the
light
through
eyes
and
he
felt
a
warm
sort
of
a
smile
inside
him
as
he
said
to
himself
he
a
damn
good
then
he
thought
of
the
spring
in
the
hills
of
southern
indiana
and
the
singing
in
the
moonlight
among
the
flowering
locust
trees
behind
the
house
he
could
almost
smell
the
heavy
sweetness
of
the
locust
blooms
as
he
used
to
smell
them
sitting
on
the
steps
after
supper
tired
from
a
day
heavy
plowing
while
the
clatter
of
his
mother
housework
came
from
the
kitchen
he
did
wish
he
was
back
there
but
it
was
pleasant
to
think
of
it
now
and
then
and
how
the
yellow
farmhouse
looked
and
the
red
barn
where
his
father
never
had
been
able
to
find
time
to
paint
the
door
and
the
cowshed
where
the
shingles
were
always
coming
off
he
wondered
dully
what
it
would
be
like
out
there
at
the
front
it
could
be
green
and
pleasant
the
way
the
country
was
here
fellows
always
said
it
was
hell
out
there
well
he
did
give
a
damn
he
went
to
sleep
he
woke
up
gradually
the
warm
comfort
of
sleep
giving
place
slowly
to
the
stiffness
of
his
uncomfortable
position
with
the
hobnails
of
a
boot
from
the
back
of
a
pack
sticking
into
his
shoulder
andrews
was
sitting
in
the
same
position
lost
in
thought
the
rest
of
the
men
sat
at
the
open
doors
or
sprawled
over
the
equipment
chrisfield
got
up
stretched
himself
yawned
and
went
to
the
door
to
look
out
there
was
a
heavy
important
step
on
the
gravel
outside
a
large
man
with
black
eyebrows
that
met
over
his
nose
and
a
very
black
stubbly
beard
passed
the
car
there
were
a
sergeants
stripes
on
his
arm
say
andy
cried
chrisfield
that
bastard
is
a
who
that
asked
andrews
getting
up
with
a
smile
his
blue
eyes
looking
mildly
into
chrisfield
black
ones
you
know
who
ah
under
their
heavy
tan
chrisfield
rounded
cheeks
were
flushed
his
eyes
snapped
under
their
long
black
lashes
his
fists
were
clutched
oh
i
know
chris
i
did
know
he
was
in
this
god
damn
him
muttered
chrisfield
in
a
low
voice
throwing
himself
down
on
his
packs
again
hold
your
horses
chris
said
andrews
we
may
all
cash
in
our
checks
before
long
no
use
letting
things
worry
i
do
give
a
damn
if
we
nor
do
i
andrews
sat
down
beside
chrisfield
again
after
a
while
the
train
got
jerkily
into
motion
the
wheels
rumbled
and
clattered
over
the
rails
and
the
clots
of
mud
bounced
up
and
down
on
the
splintered
boards
of
the
floor
chrisfield
pillowed
his
head
on
his
arm
and
went
to
sleep
again
still
smarting
from
the
flush
of
his
anger
andrews
looked
out
through
his
fingers
at
the
swaying
black
box
car
at
the
men
sprawled
about
on
the
floor
their
heads
nodding
with
each
jolt
and
at
the
clouds
and
bits
of
sparkling
blue
sky
that
he
could
see
behind
the
silhouettes
of
the
heads
and
shoulders
of
the
men
who
stood
in
the
doors
the
wheels
ground
on
endlessly
the
car
stopped
with
a
jerk
that
woke
up
all
the
sleepers
and
threw
one
man
off
his
feet
a
whistle
blew
shrilly
outside
all
right
out
of
the
cars
snap
it
up
snap
it
up
yelled
the
sergeant
the
men
piled
out
stiffly
handing
the
equipment
out
from
hand
to
hand
till
it
formed
a
confused
heap
of
packs
and
rifles
outside
all
down
the
train
at
each
door
there
was
a
confused
pile
of
equipment
and
struggling
men
snap
it
up
full
equipment
line
up
the
sergeant
yelled
the
men
fell
into
line
slowly
with
their
packs
and
rifles
lieutenants
hovered
about
the
edges
of
the
forming
lines
tightly
belted
into
their
stiff
trench
coats
scrambling
up
and
down
the
coal
piles
of
the
siding
the
men
were
given
at
ease
and
stood
leaning
on
their
rifles
staring
at
a
green
on
three
wooden
legs
over
the
top
of
which
had
been
thrown
a
huge
piece
of
torn
grey
cheesecloth
when
the
confused
sound
of
tramping
feet
subsided
they
could
hear
a
noise
in
the
distance
like
someone
lazily
shaking
a
piece
of
heavy
the
sky
was
full
of
little
dabs
of
red
purple
and
yellow
and
the
purplish
sunset
light
was
over
everything
the
order
came
to
march
they
marched
down
a
rutted
road
where
the
puddles
were
so
deep
they
had
continually
to
break
ranks
to
avoid
them
in
a
little
on
one
side
were
rows
of
heavy
motor
trucks
and
ammunition
caissons
supper
was
cooking
in
a
field
kitchen
about
which
clustered
the
truck
drivers
in
their
wide
visored
caps
beyond
the
wood
the
column
turned
off
into
a
field
behind
a
little
group
of
stone
and
stucco
houses
that
had
lost
their
roofs
in
the
field
they
halted
the
grass
was
brilliant
emerald
and
the
wood
and
the
distant
hills
were
shades
of
clear
deep
blue
wisps
of
mist
lay
across
the
field
in
the
turf
here
and
there
were
small
clean
bites
that
might
have
been
made
by
some
strange
animal
the
men
looked
at
them
curiously
no
lights
remember
we
in
sight
of
the
enemy
a
match
might
annihilate
the
detachment
announced
the
lieutenant
dramatically
after
having
given
the
orders
for
the
pup
tents
to
be
set
up
when
the
tents
were
ready
the
men
stood
about
in
the
chilly
white
mist
that
kept
growing
denser
eating
their
cold
rations
everywhere
were
grumbling
snorting
voices
god
let
turn
in
chris
before
our
bones
are
frozen
said
andrews
guards
had
been
posted
and
walked
up
and
down
with
a
stride
peering
now
and
then
suspiciously
into
the
little
wood
where
the
were
chrisfield
and
andrews
crawled
into
their
little
tent
and
rolled
up
together
in
their
blankets
getting
as
close
to
each
other
as
they
could
at
first
it
was
very
cold
and
hard
and
they
squirmed
about
restlessly
but
gradually
the
warmth
from
their
bodies
filled
their
thin
blankets
and
their
muscles
began
to
relax
andrews
went
to
sleep
first
and
chrisfield
lay
listening
to
his
deep
breathing
there
was
a
frown
on
his
face
he
was
thinking
of
the
man
who
had
walked
past
the
train
at
dijon
the
last
time
he
had
seen
that
man
anderson
was
at
training
camp
he
had
only
been
a
corporal
then
he
remembered
the
day
the
man
had
been
made
corporal
it
had
not
been
long
before
that
that
chrisfield
had
drawn
his
knife
on
him
one
night
in
the
barracks
a
fellow
had
caught
his
hand
just
in
time
anderson
had
looked
a
bit
pale
that
time
and
had
walked
away
but
he
never
spoken
a
word
to
chrisfield
since
as
he
lay
with
his
eyes
closed
pressed
close
against
andrew
limp
sleeping
body
chrisfield
could
see
the
man
face
the
eyebrows
that
joined
across
the
nose
and
the
jaw
always
blackish
from
the
heavy
beard
that
looked
blue
when
he
had
just
shaved
at
last
the
tenseness
of
his
mind
slackened
he
thought
of
women
for
a
moment
of
a
girl
he
seen
from
the
train
and
then
suddenly
crushing
sleepiness
closed
down
on
him
and
everything
went
softly
warmly
black
as
he
drifted
off
to
sleep
with
no
sense
but
the
coldness
of
one
side
and
the
warmth
of
his
bunkie
body
on
the
other
in
the
middle
of
the
night
he
awoke
and
crawled
out
of
the
tent
andrews
followed
him
their
teeth
chattered
a
little
and
they
stretched
their
legs
stiffly
it
was
cold
but
the
mist
had
vanished
the
stars
shone
brilliantly
they
walked
out
a
little
way
into
the
field
away
from
the
bunch
of
tents
to
make
water
a
faint
rustling
and
breathing
noise
as
of
animals
herded
together
came
from
the
sleeping
regiment
somewhere
a
brook
made
a
shrill
gurgling
they
strained
their
ears
but
they
could
hear
no
guns
they
stood
side
by
side
looking
up
at
the
multitudes
of
stars
that
orion
said
andrews
what
that
bunch
of
stars
there
is
called
orion
see
it
supposed
to
look
like
a
man
with
a
bow
but
he
always
looks
to
me
like
a
fellow
striding
across
the
some
stars
tonight
ai
there
gee
what
that
behind
the
dark
hills
a
glow
rose
and
fell
like
the
glow
in
a
forge
the
front
must
be
that
way
said
andrews
shivering
i
guess
know
yes
tomorrow
night
we
know
more
about
it
said
andrews
they
stood
silent
a
moment
listening
to
the
noise
the
brook
made
god
it
quiet
ai
it
this
ca
be
the
front
smell
that
what
is
it
smells
like
an
apple
tree
in
bloom
somewhere
hell
let
git
in
before
our
blankets
git
andrews
was
still
staring
at
the
group
of
stars
he
had
said
was
orion
chrisfield
pulled
him
by
the
arm
they
crawled
into
their
tent
again
rolled
up
together
and
immediately
were
crushed
under
an
exhausted
sleep
as
far
ahead
of
him
as
chrisfield
could
see
were
packs
and
heads
with
caps
at
a
variety
of
angles
all
bobbing
up
and
down
with
the
swing
of
the
brisk
marching
time
a
fine
warm
rain
was
falling
mingling
with
the
sweat
that
ran
down
his
face
the
column
had
been
marching
a
long
time
along
a
straight
road
that
was
worn
and
scarred
with
heavy
traffic
fields
and
hedges
where
clusters
of
yellow
flowers
were
in
bloom
had
given
place
to
an
avenue
of
poplars
the
light
wet
trunks
and
the
stiff
branches
hazy
with
green
filed
by
interminable
as
interminable
as
the
confused
tramp
of
feet
and
jingle
of
equipment
that
sounded
in
his
ears
say
are
we
goin
towards
the
front
goddamned
if
i
ai
no
front
within
men
sentences
came
shortly
through
their
heavy
breathing
the
column
shifted
over
to
the
side
of
the
road
to
avoid
a
train
of
motor
trucks
going
the
other
way
chrisfield
felt
the
heavy
mud
spurt
up
over
him
as
truck
after
truck
rumbled
by
with
the
wet
back
of
one
hand
he
tried
to
wipe
it
off
his
face
but
the
grit
when
he
rubbed
it
hurt
his
skin
made
tender
by
the
rain
he
swore
long
and
whiningly
half
aloud
his
rifle
felt
as
heavy
as
an
iron
girder
they
entered
a
village
of
houses
through
open
doors
they
could
see
into
comfortable
kitchens
where
copper
pots
gleamed
and
where
the
floors
were
of
clean
red
tiles
in
front
of
some
of
the
houses
were
little
gardens
full
of
crocuses
and
hyacinths
where
shone
a
very
dark
green
in
the
rain
they
marched
through
the
square
with
its
pavement
of
little
yellow
rounded
cobbles
its
grey
church
with
a
pointed
arch
in
the
door
its
cafes
with
names
painted
over
them
men
and
women
looked
out
of
doors
and
windows
the
column
perceptibly
slackened
its
speed
but
kept
on
and
as
the
houses
dwindled
and
became
farther
apart
along
the
road
the
men
hope
of
stopping
vanished
ears
were
deafened
by
the
confused
tramp
of
feet
on
the
macadam
road
feet
seemed
as
lead
as
if
all
the
weight
of
the
pack
hung
on
them
shoulders
worn
callous
began
to
grow
tender
and
sore
under
the
constant
sweating
heads
drooped
each
man
eyes
were
on
the
heels
of
the
man
ahead
of
him
that
rose
and
fell
rose
and
fell
endlessly
marching
became
for
each
man
a
personal
struggle
with
his
pack
that
seemed
to
have
come
alive
that
seemed
something
malicious
and
overpowering
wrestling
to
throw
him
the
rain
stopped
and
the
sky
brightened
a
little
taking
on
pale
yellowish
lights
as
if
the
clouds
that
hid
the
sun
were
growing
thin
the
column
halted
at
the
edge
of
a
group
of
farms
and
barns
that
scattered
along
the
road
the
men
sprawled
in
all
directions
along
the
roadside
hiding
the
bright
green
grass
with
the
of
their
uniforms
chrisfield
lay
in
the
field
beside
the
road
pressing
his
hot
face
into
the
wet
sprouting
clover
the
blood
throbbed
through
his
ears
his
arms
and
legs
seemed
to
cleave
to
the
ground
as
if
he
would
never
be
able
to
move
them
again
he
closed
his
eyes
gradually
a
cold
chill
began
stealing
through
his
body
he
sat
up
and
slipped
his
arms
out
of
the
harness
of
his
pack
someone
was
handing
him
a
cigarette
and
he
sniffed
a
little
acrid
sweet
smoke
andrews
was
lying
beside
him
his
head
propped
against
his
pack
smoking
and
poking
a
cigarette
towards
his
friend
with
a
muddy
hand
his
blue
eyes
looked
strangely
from
out
the
flaming
red
of
his
face
chrisfield
took
the
cigarette
and
fumbled
in
his
pocket
for
a
match
that
nearly
did
it
for
me
said
andrews
chrisfield
grunted
he
pulled
greedily
on
the
cigarette
a
whistle
blew
slowly
the
men
dragged
themselves
off
the
ground
and
fell
into
line
drooping
under
the
weight
of
their
equipment
the
companies
marched
off
separately
chrisfield
overheard
the
lieutenant
saying
to
a
sergeant
damn
fool
business
that
why
the
hell
could
they
have
sent
us
here
in
the
first
place
so
we
ai
goin
to
the
front
after
all
said
the
sergeant
front
hell
said
the
lieutenant
the
lieutenant
was
a
small
man
who
looked
like
a
jockey
with
a
coarse
red
face
which
now
that
he
was
angry
was
almost
purple
i
guess
they
going
to
quarter
us
here
said
somebody
immediately
everybody
began
saying
we
going
to
be
quartered
they
stood
waiting
in
formation
a
long
while
the
packs
cutting
into
their
backs
and
shoulders
at
last
the
sergeant
shouted
out
all
right
take
yer
stuff
stumbling
on
each
others
heels
they
climbed
up
into
a
dark
loft
where
the
air
was
heavy
with
the
smell
of
hay
and
with
an
acridity
of
cow
manure
from
the
stables
below
there
was
a
little
straw
in
the
corners
on
which
those
who
got
there
first
spread
their
blankets
chrisfield
and
andrews
tucked
themselves
in
a
corner
from
which
through
a
hole
where
the
tiles
had
fallen
off
the
roof
they
could
see
down
into
the
barnyard
where
white
and
speckled
chickens
pecked
about
with
jerky
movements
a
woman
stood
in
the
doorway
of
the
house
looking
suspiciously
at
the
files
of
soldiers
that
shuffled
slowly
into
the
barns
by
every
door
an
officer
went
up
to
her
a
little
red
book
in
his
hand
a
conversation
about
some
matter
proceeded
painfully
the
officer
grew
very
red
andrews
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
luxuriously
rolling
from
side
to
side
in
the
straw
chrisfield
laughed
too
he
hardly
knew
why
over
their
heads
they
could
hear
the
feet
of
pigeons
on
the
roof
and
a
constant
drowsy
through
the
barnyard
smells
began
to
drift
the
greasiness
of
food
cooking
in
the
field
kitchen
ah
hope
they
give
us
somethin
good
to
eat
said
chrisfield
hongry
as
a
so
am
i
said
andrews
say

kin
talk
their
language
a
ca
ye
andrews
nodded
his
head
vaguely
well
maybe
we
kin
git
some
aigs
or
somethin
out
of
the
lady
down
there
will
ye
try
after
mess
all
they
both
lay
back
in
the
straw
and
closed
their
eyes
their
cheeks
still
burned
from
the
rain
everything
seemed
very
peaceful
the
men
sprawled
about
talking
in
low
drowsy
voices
outside
another
shower
had
come
up
and
beat
softly
on
the
tiles
of
the
roof
chrisfield
thought
he
had
never
been
so
comfortable
in
his
life
although
his
soaked
shoes
pinched
his
cold
feet
and
his
knees
were
wet
and
cold
but
in
the
drowsiness
of
the
rain
and
of
voices
talking
quietly
about
him
he
fell
asleep
he
dreamed
he
was
home
in
indiana
but
instead
of
his
mother
cooking
at
the
stove
in
the
kitchen
there
was
the
frenchwoman
who
had
stood
in
the
farmhouse
door
and
near
her
stood
a
lieutenant
with
a
little
red
book
in
his
hand
he
was
eating
cornbread
and
syrup
off
a
broken
plate
it
was
fine
cornbread
with
a
great
deal
of
crust
on
it
crisp
and
hot
on
which
the
butter
was
cold
and
sweet
to
his
tongue
suddenly
he
stopped
eating
and
started
swearing
shouting
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
you
goddam
he
started
but
he
could
seem
to
think
of
anything
more
to
say
you
goddam
he
started
again
the
lieutenant
looked
towards
him
wrinkling
his
black
eyebrows
that
met
across
his
nose
he
was
sergeant
anderson
chris
drew
his
knife
and
ran
at
him
but
it
was
andy
his
bunkie
he
had
run
his
knife
into
he
threw
his
arms
round
body
crying
hot
tears
he
woke
up
mess
kits
were
clinking
all
about
the
dark
crowded
loft
the
men
had
already
started
piling
down
the
stairs
the
larks
filled
the
air
with
a
constant
chiming
of
little
bells
chrisfield
and
andrews
were
strolling
across
a
field
of
white
clover
that
covered
the
brow
of
a
hill
below
in
the
valley
they
could
see
a
cluster
of
red
roofs
of
farms
and
the
white
ribbon
of
the
road
where
long
trains
of
motor
trucks
crawled
like
beetles
the
sun
had
just
set
behind
the
blue
hills
the
other
side
of
the
shallow
valley
the
air
was
full
of
the
smell
of
clover
and
of
hawthorn
from
the
hedgerows
they
took
deep
breaths
as
they
crossed
the
field
it
great
to
get
away
from
that
crowd
andrews
was
saying
chrisfield
walked
on
silently
dragging
his
feet
through
the
matted
clover
a
leaden
dullness
weighed
like
some
sort
of
warm
choking
coverlet
on
his
limbs
so
that
it
seemed
an
effort
to
walk
an
effort
to
speak
yet
under
it
his
muscles
were
taut
and
trembling
as
he
had
known
them
to
be
before
when
he
was
about
to
get
into
a
fight
or
to
make
love
to
a
girl
why
the
hell
do
they
let
us
git
into
it
he
said
suddenly
yes
be
better
than
this
wait
wait
they
walked
on
hearing
the
constant
chirrup
of
the
larks
the
brush
of
their
feet
through
the
clover
the
faint
jingle
of
some
coins
in
chrisfield
pocket
and
in
the
distance
the
irregular
snoring
of
an
aeroplane
motor
as
they
walked
andrews
leaned
over
from
time
to
time
and
picked
a
couple
of
the
white
clover
flowers
the
aeroplane
came
suddenly
nearer
and
swooped
in
a
wide
curve
above
the
field
drowning
every
sound
in
the
roar
of
its
exhaust
they
made
out
the
figures
of
the
pilot
and
the
observer
before
the
plane
rose
again
and
vanished
against
the
ragged
purple
clouds
of
the
sky
the
observer
had
waved
a
hand
at
them
as
he
passed
they
stood
still
in
the
darkening
field
staring
up
at
the
sky
where
a
few
larks
still
hung
chirruping
ah
lahk
to
be
one
o
them
guys
said
chrisfield
you
would
god
damn
it
ah

up

on
the
hill
this

said
andrews
looking
dreamily
at
the
pale
orange
band
of
light
where
the
sun
had
set
go
down
and
get
a
bottle
of
now
yo
talkin
ah
wonder
if
that
girl

there
antoinette
boy
ah
lahk
to
have
her
all
by
some
their
steps
grew
brisker
as
they
strode
along
a
road
that
led
through
high
hedgerows
to
a
village
under
the
brow
of
the
hill
it
was
almost
dark
under
the
shadow
of
the
bushes
on
either
side
overhead
the
purple
clouds
were
washed
over
by
a
pale
yellow
light
that
gradually
faded
to
grey
birds
chirped
and
rustled
among
the
young
leaves
andrews
put
his
hand
on
chrisfield
shoulder
let
walk
slow
he
said
we
do
want
to
get
out
of
here
too
he
grabbed
carelessly
at
little
cluster
of
hawthorn
flowers
as
he
passed
them
and
seemed
reluctant
to
untangle
the
thorny
branches
that
caught
in
his
coat
and
on
his
loosely
wound
puttees
hell
man
said
chrisfield
we
wo
have
time
to
get
a
bellyful
it
must
be
gettin
late
they
hastened
their
steps
again
and
came
in
a
moment
to
the
first
tightly
shuttered
houses
of
the
village
in
the
middle
of
the
road
was
an
who
stood
with
his
legs
wide
apart
waving
his
billy
languidly
he
had
a
red
face
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
shuttered
upper
window
of
a
house
through
the
chinks
of
which
came
a
few
streaks
of
yellow
light
his
lips
were
puckered
up
as
if
to
whistle
but
no
sound
came
he
swayed
back
and
forth
indecisively
an
officer
came
suddenly
out
of
the
little
green
door
of
the
house
in
front
of
the
who
brought
his
heels
together
with
a
jump
and
saluted
holding
his
hand
a
long
while
to
his
cap
the
officer
flicked
a
hand
up
hastily
to
his
hat
snatching
his
cigar
out
of
his
mouth
for
an
instant
as
the
officer
steps
grew
fainter
down
the
road
the
gradually
returned
to
his
former
position
chrisfield
and
andrews
had
slipped
by
on
the
other
side
and
gone
in
at
the
door
of
a
small
ramshackle
house
of
which
the
windows
were
closed
by
heavy
wooden
shutters
i
bet
there
ai
many
of
them
bastards
at
the
front
said
chris
not
many
of
either
kind
of
bastards
said
andrews
laughing
as
he
closed
the
door
behind
them
they
were
in
a
room
that
had
once
been
the
parlor
of
a
farmhouse
the
chandelier
with
its
bits
of
crystal
and
the
on
a
piece
of
dusty
red
velvet
under
a
bell
glass
on
the
mantelpiece
denoted
that
the
furniture
had
been
taken
out
and
four
square
oak
tables
crowded
in
at
one
of
the
tables
sat
three
americans
and
at
another
a
very
young
french
soldier
who
sat
hunched
over
his
table
looking
moodily
down
into
his
glass
of
wine
a
girl
in
a
faded
frock
of
some
purplish
material
that
showed
the
strong
curves
of
her
shoulders
and
breasts
slouched
into
the
room
her
hands
in
the
pocket
of
a
dark
blue
apron
against
which
her
rounded
forearms
showed
golden
brown
her
face
had
the
same
golden
tan
under
a
mass
of
dark
blonde
hair
she
smiled
when
she
saw
the
two
soldiers
drawing
her
thin
lips
away
from
her
ugly
yellow
teeth
ca

andrews

said

red
hands
crossed
on

apron
her
eyes
moved
from
chrisfield
to
the
frenchman
and
back
again
chrisfield
turned
a
little
round
in
his
chair
and
looked
at
the
frenchman
feeling
in
his
eyes
for
a
moment
a
glance
of
the
eyes
andrews
leaned
back
against
the
wall
sipping
his
wine
his
eyes
contracted
dreamily
fixed
on
the
shadow
of
the
chandelier
which
the
cheap
with
its
tin
reflector
cast
on

peeling

of
the

andrews
antoinette

chrisfield
leaned
back
in
his
chair
with
an
empty
glass
in
his
hand
and
watched
his
friend
admiringly
antoinette

andrews
in
a
courtly
voice
a
woman
put
her
head
in

the

face
and
hair
as

years

heavily
against

across

gravely
and
went

and

sulkily
in

again
andrews

already
sitting
opposite

looking
impassive
as

clay
banks
where
he
used
to
go
in
swimming
he
seemed
to
see
it
all
before
him
to
smell
the
winey
smell
of
the
silo
to
see
the
cattle
with
their
chewing
mouths
always
stained
a
little
with
green
waiting
to
get
through
the
gate
to
the
water
trough
and
the
yellow
dust
and
roar
of
and
the
quiet
evening
breeze
cooling
his
throat
and
neck
when
he
lay
out
on
a
shack
of
hay
that
he
had
been
tossing
all
day
long
under
the
tingling
sun
but
all
he
managed
to
say
was

muttered
chris
in
a
low
voice
he
felt
his
muscles
contract
with
a
furious
irritation
he
looked
through
eyes
at
the
men
in
the
room
seeing
them
in
distorted
white
lights
and
reddish
shadows
he
thought
of
himself
throwing
a
grenade
among
a
crowd
of
men
then
he
saw
the
face
of
anderson
a
ponderous
white
face
with
eyebrows
that
met
across
his
nose
and
a
bluish
shaved
chin
where
does

said

of
sheba
not

goddam
his
voice
trailed
off
into
an
inaudible
muttering
of
oaths
o
the
oak
and
the
ash
and
the
weeping
willow
tree
o
green
grows
the
grass
in
god
countree
somebody
sang
again
chrisfield
saw
a
woman
standing
beside
the
table
with
her
back
to
him
collecting
the
bottles
andy
was
paying
her
antoinette
he
said
he
got
to
his
feet
and
put
his
arms
round
her
shoulders
with
a
quick
movement
of
the
elbows
she
pushed
him
back
into
his
chair
she
turned
round
he
saw
the
sallow
face
and
thin
breasts
of
the
older
sister
she
looked
in
his
eyes
with
surprise
he
was
grinning
drunkenly
as
she
left
the
room
she
made
a
sign
to
him
with
her
head
to
follow
her
he
got
up
and
staggered
out
the
door
pulling
andrews
after
him
in
the
inner
room
was
a
big
bed
with
curtains
where
the
women
slept
and
the
fireplace
where
they
did
their
cooking
it
was
dark
except
for
the
corner
where
he
and
andrews
stood
blinking
in
the
glare
of
a
candle
on
the
table
beyond
they
could
only
see
ruddy
shadows
and
the
huge
curtained
bed
with
its
red
coverlet
the
frenchman
somewhere
in
the
dark
of
the
room
said
something
several
times
avions
boches
they
were
quiet
above
them
they
heard
the
snoring
of
aeroplane
motors
rising
and
falling
like
the
buzzing
of
a
fly
against
a
window
pane
they
all
looked
at
each
other
curiously
antoinette
was
leaning
against
the
bed
her
face
expressionless
her
heavy
hair
had
come
undone
and
fell
in
smoky
gold
waves
about
her
shoulders
the
older
woman
was
giggling
come
on
let
see
what
doing
chris
said
andrews
they
went
out
into
the
dark
village
street
to
hell
with
women
chris
this
is
the
war
cried
andrews
in
a
loud
drunken
voice
as
they
reeled
arm
in
arm
up
the
street
you
bet
it
the
war
ah
to
beat
up
chrisfield
felt
his
friend
hand
clapped
over
his
mouth
he
let
himself
go
limply
feeling
himself
pushed
to
the
side
of
the
road
somewhere
in
the
dark
he
heard
an
officer
voice
say
bring
those
men
to
yes
sir
came
another
voice
slow
heavy
footsteps
came
up
the
road
in
their
direction
andrews
kept
pushing
him
back
along
the
side
of
a
house
until
suddenly
they
both
fell
sprawling
in
a
manure
pit
lie
still
for
god
sake
muttered
andrews
throwing
an
arm
over
chrisfield
chest
a
thick
odor
of
dry
manure
filled
their
nostrils
they
heard
the
steps
come
nearer
wander
about
irresolutely
and
then
go
off
in
the
direction
from
which
they
had
come
meanwhile
the
throb
of
motors
overhead
grew
louder
and
louder
well
came
the
officer
voice
could
find
them
sir
mumbled
the
other
voice
nonsense
those
men
were
drunk
came
the
officer
voice
yes
sir
came
the
other
voice
humbly
chrisfield
started
to
giggle
he
felt
he
must
yell
aloud
with
laughter
the
nearest
motor
stopped
its
singsong
roar
making
the
night
seem
deathly
silent
andrews
jumped
to
his
feet
the
air
was
split
by
a
shriek
followed
by
a
racking
snorting
explosion
they
saw
the
wall
above
their
pit
light
up
with
a
red
momentary
glare
chrisfield
got
to
his
feet
expecting
to
see
flaming
ruins
the
village
street
was
the
same
as
ever
there
was
a
little
light
from
the
glow
the
moon
still
under
the
horizon
gave
to
the
sky
a
window
in
the
house
opposite
showed
yellow
in
it
was
a
blue
silhouette
of
an
officer
cap
and
uniform
a
little
group
stood
in
the
street
below
what
was
that
the
form
in
the
window
was
shouting
in
a
peremptory
voice
german
aeroplane
just
dropped
a
bomb
major
came
a
breathless
voice
in
reply
why
the
devil
do
he
close
that
window
a
voice
was
muttering
all
the
while
juss
a
target
for
to
aim
at
a
target
to
aim
any
damage
done
asked
the
major
through
the
silence
the
snoring
of
the
motors
ominously
overhead
like
giant
mosquitoes
i
seem
to
hear
more
said
the
major
in
his
drawling
voice
o
yes
sir
yes
sir
lots
answered
an
eager
voice
for
god
sake
tell
him
to
close
the
window
lieutenant
muttered
another
voice
how
the
hell
can
i
tell
him
you
tell
we
all
be
killed
that
all
there
is
about
there
are
no
shelters
or
dugouts
drawled
the
major
from
the
window
that
headquarters
there
the
cellar
cried
the
eager
voice
again
oh
said
the
major
three
snorting
explosions
in
quick
succession
drowned
everything
in
a
red
glare
the
street
was
suddenly
filled
with
a
scuttle
of
villagers
running
to
shelter
say
andy
they
may
have
a
roll
call
said
chrisfield
we
better
cut
for
home
across
country
said
andrews
they
climbed
cautiously
out
of
their
manure
pit
chrisfield
was
surprised
to
find
that
he
was
trembling
his
hands
were
cold
it
was
with
difficulty
he
kept
his
teeth
from
chattering
god
we
stink
for
a
let
git
out
muttered
chrisfield
o
this
goddam
they
ran
out
through
an
orchard
broke
through
a
hedge
and
climbed
up
the
hill
across
the
open
fields
down
the
main
road
an
gun
had
started
barking
and
the
sky
sparkled
with
exploding
shrapnel
the
put
put
put
of
a
machine
gun
had
begun
somewhere
chrisfield
strode
up
the
hill
in
step
with
his
friend
behind
them
bomb
followed
bomb
and
above
them
the
air
seemed
full
of
exploding
shrapnel
and
droning
planes
the
cognac
still
throbbed
a
little
in
their
blood
they
stumbled
against
each
other
now
and
then
as
they
walked
from
the
top
of
the
hill
they
turned
and
looked
back
chrisfield
felt
a
tremendous
elation
thumping
stronger
than
the
cognac
through
his
veins
unconsciously
he
put
his
arm
round
his
shoulders
they
seemed
the
only
live
things
in
a
reeling
world
below
in
the
valley
a
house
was
burning
brightly
from
all
directions
came
the
yelp
of
guns
and
overhead
unperturbed
continued
the
leisurely
singsong
of
the
motors
suddenly
chrisfield
burst
out
laughing
by
god
ah
always
have
fun
when
ah
out
with
you
andy
he
said
they
turned
and
hurried
down
the
other
slope
of
the
hill
towards
the
farms
where
they
were
quartered
ii
as
far
as
he
could
see
in
every
direction
were
the
grey
trunks
of
beeches
bright
green
with
moss
on
one
side
the
ground
was
thick
with
last
year
leaves
that
rustled
maddeningly
with
every
step
in
front
of
him
his
eyes
followed
other
patches
of
moving
among
the
tree
trunks
overhead
through
the
mottled
light
and
dark
green
of
the
leaves
he
could
see
now
and
then
a
patch
of
heavy
grey
sky
greyer
than
the
silvery
trunks
that
moved
about
him
in
every
direction
as
he
walked
he
strained
his
eyes
down
each
alley
until
they
were
dazzled
by
the
reiteration
of
mottled
grey
and
green
now
and
then
the
rustling
stopped
ahead
of
him
and
the
patches
were
still
then
above
the
clamour
of
the
blood
in
his
ears
he
could
hear
batteries
pong
pong
pong
in
the
distance
and
the
woods
ringing
with
a
sound
like
hail
as
a
heavy
shell
hurtled
above
the
tree
tops
to
end
in
a
dull
rumble
miles
away
chrisfield
was
soaked
with
sweat
but
he
could
not
feel
his
arms
or
legs
every
sense
was
concentrated
in
eyes
and
ears
and
in
the
consciousness
of
his
gun
time
and
again
he
pictured
himself
taking
sight
at
something
grey
that
moved
and
firing
his
forefinger
itched
to
press
the
trigger
he
would
take
aim
very
carefully
he
told
himself
he
pictured
a
dab
of
grey
starting
up
from
behind
a
grey
tree
trunk
and
the
sharp
detonation
of
his
rifle
and
the
dab
of
grey
rolling
among
the
last
year
leaves
a
branch
carried
his
helmet
off
his
head
so
that
it
rolled
at
his
feet
and
bounced
with
a
faint
metallic
sound
against
the
root
of
a
tree
he
was
blinded
by
the
sudden
terror
that
seized
him
his
heart
seemed
to
roll
from
side
to
side
in
his
chest
he
stood
stiff
as
if
paralyzed
for
a
moment
before
he
could
stoop
and
pick
the
helmet
up
there
was
a
curious
taste
of
blood
in
his
mouth
ah
pay
fer
that
he
muttered
between
clenched
teeth
his
fingers
were
still
trembling
when
he
stooped
to
pick
up
the
helmet
which
he
put
on
again
very
carefully
fastening
it
with
the
strap
under
his
chin
furious
anger
had
taken
hold
of
him
the
patches
ahead
had
moved
forward
again
he
followed
looking
eagerly
to
the
right
and
the
left
praying
he
might
see
something
in
every
direction
were
the
silvery
trunk
of
the
beeches
each
with
a
vivid
green
streak
on
one
side
with
every
step
the
last
year
russet
leaves
rustled
underfoot
maddeningly
loud
almost
out
of
sight
among
the
moving
tree
trunks
was
a
log
it
was
not
a
log
it
was
a
bunch
of
cloth
without
thinking
chrisfield
strode
towards
it
the
silver
trunks
of
the
beeches
circled
about
him
waving
jagged
arms
it
was
a
german
lying
full
length
among
the
leaves
chrisfield
was
furiously
happy
in
the
angry
pumping
of
blood
through
his
veins
he
could
see
the
buttons
on
the
back
of
the
long
coat
of
the
german
and
the
red
band
on
his
cap
he
kicked
the
german
he
could
feel
the
ribs
against
his
toes
through
the
leather
of
his
boot
he
kicked
again
and
again
with
all
his
might
the
german
rolled
over
heavily
he
had
no
face
chrisfield
felt
the
hatred
suddenly
ebb
out
of
him
where
the
face
had
been
was
a
spongy
mass
of
purple
and
yellow
and
red
half
of
which
stuck
to
the
russet
leaves
when
the
body
rolled
over
large
flies
with
bright
shiny
green
bodies
circled
about
it
in
a
brown
hand
was
a
revolver
chrisfield
felt
his
spine
go
cold
the
german
had
shot
himself
he
ran
off
suddenly
breathlessly
to
join
the
rest
of
the
reconnoitering
squad
the
silent
beeches
whirled
about
him
waving
gnarled
boughs
above
his
head
the
german
had
shot
himself
that
was
why
he
had
no
face
chrisfield
fell
into
line
behind
the
other
men
the
corporal
waited
for
him
see
anything
he
asked
not
a
goddam
thing
muttered
chrisfield
almost
inaudibly
the
corporal
went
off
to
the
head
of
the
line
chrisfield
was
alone
again
the
leaves
rustled
maddeningly
loud
underfoot
iii
chrisfield
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
leaves
at
the
tops
of
the
walnut
trees
etched
like
metal
against
the
bright
colorless
sky
edged
with
flicks
and
fringes
of
gold
where
the
sunlight
struck
them
he
stood
stiff
and
motionless
at
attention
although
there
was
a
sharp
pain
in
his
left
ankle
that
seemed
swollen
enough
to
burst
the
worn
boot
he
could
feel
the
presence
of
men
on
both
sides
of
him
and
of
men
again
beyond
them
it
seemed
as
if
the
stiff
line
of
men
in
standing
at
attention
waiting
endlessly
for
someone
to
release
them
from
their
erect
paralysis
must
stretch
unbroken
round
the
world
he
let
his
glance
fall
to
the
trampled
grass
of
the
field
where
the
regiment
was
drawn
up
somewhere
behind
him
he
could
hear
the
clinking
of
spurs
at
some
officer
heels
then
there
was
the
sound
of
a
motor
on
the
road
suddenly
shut
off
and
there
were
steps
coming
down
the
line
of
men
and
a
group
of
officers
passed
hurriedly
with
a
businesslike
stride
as
if
they
did
nothing
else
all
their
lives
chrisfield
made
out
eagles
on
tight
khaki
shoulders
then
a
single
star
and
a
double
star
above
which
was
a
red
ear
and
some
grey
hair
the
general
passed
too
soon
for
him
to
make
out
his
face
chrisfield
swore
to
himself
a
little
because
his
ankle
hurt
so
his
eyes
travelled
back
to
the
fringe
of
the
trees
against
the
bright
sky
so
this
was
what
he
got
for
those
weeks
in
dugouts
for
all
the
times
he
had
thrown
himself
on
his
belly
in
the
mud
for
the
bullets
he
had
shot
into
the
unknown
at
grey
specks
that
moved
among
the
grey
mud
something
was
crawling
up
the
middle
of
his
back
he
was
sure
if
it
were
a
louse
or
if
he
were
imagining
it
an
order
had
been
shouted
automatically
he
had
changed
his
position
to
parade
rest
somewhere
far
away
a
little
man
was
walking
towards
the
long
drab
lines
a
wind
had
come
up
rustling
the
stiff
leaves
of
the
grove
of
walnut
trees
the
voice
squeaked
above
it
but
chrisfield
could
not
make
out
what
it
said
the
wind
in
the
trees
made
a
vast
rhythmic
sound
like
the
churning
of
water
astern
of
the
transport
he
had
come
over
on
gold
flicks
and
olive
shadows
danced
among
the
indented
clusters
of
leaves
as
they
swayed
as
if
sweeping
something
away
against
the
bright
sky
an
idea
came
into
chrisfield
head
suppose
the
leaves
should
sweep
in
broader
and
broader
curves
until
they
should
reach
the
ground
and
sweep
and
sweep
until
all
this
was
swept
away
all
these
pains
and
lice
and
uniforms
and
officers
with
maple
leaves
or
eagles
or
single
stars
or
double
stars
or
triple
stars
on
their
shoulders
he
had
a
sudden
picture
of
himself
in
his
old
comfortable
overalls
with
his
shirt
open
so
that
the
wind
caressed
his
neck
like
a
girl
blowing
down
it
playfully
lying
on
a
shuck
of
hay
under
the
hot
indiana
sun
funny
he
thought
all
that
he
said
to
himself
before
he
known
andy
he
never
have
thought
of
that
what
had
come
over
him
these
days
the
regiment
was
marching
away
in
columns
of
fours
chrisfield
ankle
gave
him
sharp
hot
pain
with
every
step
his
tunic
was
too
tight
and
the
sweat
tingled
on
his
back
all
about
him
were
sweating
irritated
faces
the
woollen
tunics
with
their
high
collars
were
like
that
hot
afternoon
chrisfield
marched
with
his
fists
clenched
he
wanted
to
fight
somebody
to
run
his
bayonet
into
a
man
as
he
ran
it
into
the
dummy
in
that
everlasting
bayonet
drill
he
wanted
to
strip
himself
naked
to
squeeze
the
wrists
of
a
girl
until
she
screamed
his
company
was
marching
past
another
company
that
was
lined
up
to
be
dismissed
in
front
of
a
ruined
barn
which
had
a
roof
that
sagged
in
the
middle
like
an
old
cow
back
the
sergeant
stood
in
front
of
them
with
his
arms
crossed
looking
critically
at
the
company
that
marched
past
he
had
a
white
heavy
face
and
black
eyebrows
that
met
over
his
nose
chrisfield
stared
hard
at
him
as
he
passed
but
sergeant
anderson
did
not
seem
to
recognize
him
it
gave
him
a
dull
angry
feeling
as
if
been
cut
by
a
friend
the
company
melted
suddenly
into
a
group
of
men
unbuttoning
their
shirts
and
tunics
in
front
of
the
little
board
shanty
where
they
were
quartered
which
had
been
put
up
by
the
french
at
the
time
of
the
marne
years
before
so
a
man
had
told
andy
what
are
you
dreamin
about
indiana
said
judkins
punching
chrisfield
jovially
in
the
ribs
chrisfield
doubled
his
fists
and
gave
him
a
smashing
blow
in
the
jaw
that
judkins
warded
of
just
in
time
judkins
face
flamed
red
he
swung
with
a
long
bent
arm
what
the
hell
think
this
is
shouted
somebody
what
he
want
to
hit
me
for
spluttered
judkins
breathless
men
had
edged
in
between
them
lem
me
git
at
shut
up
you
fool
said
andy
drawing
chrisfield
away
the
company
scattered
sullenly
some
of
the
men
lay
down
in
the
long
uncut
grass
in
the
shade
of
the
ruins
of
the
house
one
of
the
walls
of
which
made
a
wall
of
the
shanty
where
they
lived
andrews
and
chrisfield
strolled
in
silence
down
the
road
kicking
their
feet
into
the
deep
dust
chrisfield
was
limping
on
both
sides
of
the
road
were
fields
of
ripe
wheat
golden
under
the
sun
in
the
distance
were
low
green
hills
fading
to
blue
pale
yellow
in
patches
with
the
ripe
grain
here
and
there
a
thick
clump
of
trees
or
a
screen
of
poplars
broke
the
flatness
of
the
long
smooth
hills
in
the
hedgerows
were
blue
cornflowers
and
poppies
in
all
colors
from
carmine
to
orange
that
danced
in
the
wind
on
their
wiry
stalks
at
the
turn
in
the
road
they
lost
the
noise
of
the
division
and
could
hear
the
bees
droning
in
the
big
dull
purple
cloverheads
and
in
the
gold
hearts
of
the
daisies
you
a
wild
man

the
hell

said
andrews
his
voice
trembling
with
sudden
excitement
ah
dreamed

flies

round
him
was
aeroplanes
remember
the
last
rest
village
and
the
major
who
would
close
the
window
you
bet
i
do
they
lay
down
on
the
grassy
bank
that
sloped
from
the
road
to
the
pond
the
road
was
hidden
from
them
by
the
tall
reeds
through
which
the
wind
lisped
softly
overhead
huge
white
cumulus
clouds
piled
tier
on
tier
like
fantastic
galleons
in
full
sail
floated
changing
slowly
in
a
greenish
sky
the
reflection
of
clouds
in
the
silvery
glisten
of
the
pond
surface
was
broken
by
clumps
of
grasses
and
bits
of
floating
weeds
they
lay
on
their
backs
for
some
time
before
they
started
taking
their
clothes
off
looking
up
at
the
sky
that
seemed
vast
and
free
like
the
ocean
vaster
and
freer
than
the
ocean
sarge
says
a
delousin
machine
comin
through
this
way
we
need
it
andrews
pulled
his
clothes
off
slowly
it
great
to
feel
the
sun
and
the
wind
on
your
body
is
it
chris
andrews
walked
towards
the
pond
and
lay
flat
on
his
belly
on
the
fine
soft
grass
near
the
edge
it
great
to
have
your
body
there
is
it
he
said
in
a
dreamy
voice
your
skin
so
soft
and
supple
and
nothing
in
the
world
has
the
feel
a
muscle
has
gee
i
do
know
what
i
do
without
my
chrisfield
laughed
look
how
ma
ole
ankle
raised
found
any
cooties
yet
he
said
i
try
and
drown
said
andrews
chris
come
away
from
those
stinking
uniforms
and
you
feel
like
a
human
being
with
the
sun
on
your
flesh
instead
of
like
a
lousy
hello
boys
came
a
voice
unexpectedly
a
y
man
with
sharp
nose
and
chin
had
come
up
behind
them
hello
said
chrisfield
sullenly
limping
towards
the
water
want
the
soap
said
andrews
going
to
take
a
swim
boys
asked
the
y
man
then
he
added
in
a
tone
of
conviction
that
better
come
in
too
said
andrews
thanks
thanks
say
if
you
do
mind
my
suggestion
why
do
you
fellers
get
under
the
water
you
see
there
two
french
girls
looking
at
you
from
the
the
y
man
giggled
faintly
they
do
mind
said
andrews
soaping
himself
vigorously
ah
reckon
they
lahk
it
said
chrisfield
i
know
they
have
any
morals
but
and
why
should
they
not
look
at
us
maybe
there
wo
be
many
people
who
get
a
what
do
you
mean
have
you
ever
seen
what
a
little
splinter
of
a
shell
does
to
a
body
asked
andrews
savagely
he
splashed
into
the
shallow
water
and
swam
towards
the
middle
of
the
pond
ye
might
ask
to
come
down
and
help
us
pick
the
cooties
off
said
chrisfield
and
followed
in
andrews
wake
in
the
middle
he
lay
on
a
sand
bank
in
the
warm
shallow
water
and
looked
back
at
the
y
man
who
still
stood
on
the
bank
behind
him
were
other
men
undressing
and
soon
the
grassy
slope
was
filled
with
naked
men
and
yellowish
grey
underclothes
and
many
dark
heads
and
gleaming
backs
were
bobbing
up
and
down
in
the
water
when
he
came
out
he
found
andrews
sitting
near
his
clothes
he
reached
for
his
shirt
and
drew
it
on
him
god
i
ca
make
up
my
mind
to
put
the
damn
thing
on
again
said
andrews
in
a
low
voice
almost
as
if
he
were
talking
to
himself
i
feel
so
clean
and
free
it
like
voluntarily
taking
up
filth
and
slavery
again
i
think
i
just
walk
off
naked
across
the
call
serving
your
country
slavery
my
friend
the
y
man
who
had
been
roaming
among
the
bathers
his
neat
uniform
and
boots
and
puttees
contrasting
strangely
with
the
clothing
of
the
men
about
him
sat
down
on
the
grass
beside
andrews
you
goddam
right
i
you
get
into
trouble
my
boy
if
you
talk
that
way
said
the
y
man
in
a
cautious
voice
well
what
is
your
definition
of
slavery
you
must
remember
that
you
are
a
voluntary
worker
in
the
cause
of
democracy
you
doing
this
so
that
your
children
will
be
able
to
live
peaceful
ever
shot
a
man
no
no
of
course
not
but
i
have
enlisted
really
i
would
only
my
eyes
are
i
guess
so
said
andrews
under
his
breath
remember
that
your
women
folks
your
sisters
and
sweethearts
and
mothers
are
praying
for
you
at
this
i
wish
somebody
pray
me
into
a
clean
shirt
said
andrews
starting
to
get
into
his
clothes
how
long
have
you
been
over
here
just
three
the
man
sallow
face
with
its
pinched
nose
and
chin
lit
up
but
boys
those
three
months
have
been
worth
all
the
other
years
of
my
min
he
caught
himself
life
i
heard
the
great
heart
of
america
beat
o
boys
never
forget
that
you
are
in
a
great
christian
come
on
chris
let
beat
they
left
the
y
man
wandering
among
the
men
along
the
bank
of
the
pond
to
which
the
reflection
of
the
greenish
silvery
sky
and
the
great
piled
white
clouds
gave
all
the
free
immensity
of
space
from
the
road
they
could
still
hear
his
high
pitched
voice
and
that
what
survive
you
and
me
said
andrews
say
andy
you
sure
can
talk
to
them
guys
said
chris
admiringly
what
the
use
of
talking
god
there
a
bit
of
honeysuckle
still
in
bloom
does
that
smell
like
home
to
you
chris
say
how
much
do
they
pay
those
men
andy
damned
if
i
they
were
just
in
time
to
fall
into
line
for
mess
in
the
line
everyone
was
talking
and
laughing
enlivened
by
the
smell
of
food
and
the
tinkle
of
near
the
field
kitchen
chrisfield
saw
sergeant
anderson
talking
with
higgins
his
own
sergeant
they
were
laughing
together
and
he
heard
anderson
big
voice
saying
jovially
we
pulled
through
this
time
higgins
i
guess
we
will
the
two
sergeants
looked
at
each
other
and
cast
a
paternal
condescending
glance
over
their
men
and
laughed
aloud
chrisfield
felt
powerless
as
an
ox
under
the
yoke
all
he
could
do
was
work
and
strain
and
stand
at
attention
while
that
anderson
could
lounge
about
as
if
he
owned
the
earth
and
laugh
importantly
like
that
he
held
out
his
plate
the
splashed
the
meat
and
gravy
into
it
he
leaned
against
the
wall
of
the
shack
eating
his
food
and
looking
sullenly
over
at
the
two
sergeants
who
laughed
and
talked
with
an
air
of
leisure
while
the
men
of
their
two
companies
ate
hurriedly
as
dogs
all
round
them
chrisfield
glanced
suddenly
at
anderson
who
sat
in
the
grass
at
the
back
of
the
house
looking
out
over
the
wheat
fields
while
the
smoke
of
a
cigarette
rose
in
spirals
about
his
face
and
his
fair
hair
he
looked
peaceful
almost
happy
chrisfield
clenched
his
fists
and
felt
the
hatred
of
that
other
man
rising
stingingly
within
him
guess
ah
got
a
bit
of
the
devil
in
me
he
thought
the
windows
were
so
near
the
grass
that
the
faint
light
had
a
greenish
color
in
the
shack
where
the
company
was
quartered
it
gave
men
faces
tanned
as
they
were
the
sickly
look
of
people
who
work
in
offices
when
they
lay
on
their
blankets
in
the
bunks
made
of
chicken
wire
stretched
across
mouldy
scantlings
swallows
had
made
their
nests
in
the
peak
of
the
roof
and
their
droppings
made
white
dobs
and
blotches
on
the
floorboards
in
the
alley
between
the
bunks
where
a
few
patches
of
yellow
grass
had
not
yet
been
completely
crushed
away
by
footsteps
now
that
the
shack
was
empty
chrisfield
could
hear
plainly
the
of
the
little
swallows
in
their
mud
nests
he
sat
quiet
on
the
end
of
one
of
the
bunks
looking
out
of
the
open
door
at
the
blue
shadows
that
were
beginning
to
lengthen
on
the
grass
of
the
meadow
behind
his
hands
that
had
got
to
be
the
color
of
terra
cotta
hung
idly
between
his
legs
he
was
whistling
faintly
his
eyes
in
their
long
black
eyelashes
were
fixed
on
the
distance
though
he
was
not
thinking
he
felt
a
comfortable
unexpressed
all
over
him
it
was
pleasant
to
be
alone
in
the
barracks
like
this
when
the
other
men
were
out
at
grenade
practice
there
was
no
chance
of
anyone
shouting
orders
at
him
a
warm
drowsiness
came
over
him
from
the
field
kitchen
alongside
came
the
voice
of
a
man
singing
o
my
girl
a
lulu
every
inch
a
lulu
is
lulu
that
pretty
lil
girl
o
in
their
mud
nests
the
young
swallows
twittered
faintly
overhead
now
and
then
there
was
a
beat
of
wings
and
a
big
swallow
skimmed
into
the
shack
chrisfield
cheeks
began
to
feel
very
softly
flushed
his
head
drooped
over
on
his
chest
outside
the
cook
was
singing
over
and
over
again
in
a
low
voice
amid
a
faint
clatter
of
pans
o
my
girl
a
lulu
every
inch
a
lulu
is
lulu
that
pretty
lil
girl
o
chrisfield
fell
asleep
he
woke
up
with
a
start
the
shack
was
almost
dark
a
tall
man
stood
out
black
against
the
bright
oblong
of
the
door
what
are
you
doing
here
said
a
deep
snarling
voice
chrisfield
eyes
blinked
automatically
he
got
to
his
feet
it
might
be
an
officer
his
eyes
focussed
suddenly
it
was
anderson
face
that
was
between
him
and
the
light
in
the
greenish
obscurity
the
skin
looked
in
contrast
to
the
heavy
eyebrows
that
met
over
the
nose
and
the
dark
stubble
on
the
chin
how
is
it
you
ai
out
with
the
company
ah
barracks
guard
muttered
chrisfield
he
could
feel
the
blood
beating
in
his
wrists
and
temples
stinging
his
eyes
like
fire
he
was
staring
at
the
floor
in
front
of
anderson
feet
orders
was
all
the
companies
was
to
go
out
an
not
leave
any
ah
we
see
about
that
when
sergeant
higgins
comes
in
is
this
place
tidy
you
say
ah
a
goddamed
liar
do
ye
chrisfield
felt
suddenly
cool
and
joyous
he
felt
anger
taking
possession
of
him
he
seemed
to
be
standing
somewhere
away
from
himself
watching
himself
get
angry
this
place
has
got
to
be
cleaned
up
that
damn
general
may
come
back
to
look
over
quarters
went
on
anderson
coolly
you
call
me
a
goddam
liar
said
chrisfield
again
putting
as
much
insolence
as
he
could
summon
into
his
voice
ah
guess
you
remember
yes
i
know
you
the
guy
tried
to
run
a
knife
into
me
once
said
anderson
coolly
squaring
his
shoulders
i
guess

a
little
discipline
by
this
time
anyhow

to
clean
this
place
up
god

even
brushed

birds

said
anderson
with
a
half
laugh
ah
ai
agoin
to
neither
fur
look
here

do
it
or
it
be
the
worse
for
you
shouted
the
sergeant
in
his
deep
rasping
voice
if
ever
ah
gits
out
o
the
army
ah
goin
to
shoot
you
you
picked
on
me
chrisfield
spoke
slowly
as
coolly
as
anderson
well
we
see
what
a
has
to
say
to
ah
doan
give
a
hoot
in
hell
what
ye
sergeant
anderson
turned
on
his
heel
and
went
out
twisting
the
corner
button
of
his
tunic
in
his
big
fingers
already
the
sound
of
tramping
feet
was
heard
and
the
shouted
order
then
men
crowded
into
the
shack
laughing
and
talking
chrisfield
sat
still
on
the
end
of
the
bunk
looking
at
the
bright
oblong
of
the
door
outside
he
saw
anderson
talking
to
sergeant
higgins
they

andersen
booming
laugh
faded
as
he
walked
away
sergeant
higgins
came
into
the
shack
and
walked
straight
up
to
chrisfield
saying
in
a
hard
official
voice

went
out

eyes
were
turned
curiously
on
chrisfield
small
a
man
with
a
long
nose
that
hung
down
over
his
upper
lip
shuffled
sheepishly
over
to
his
place
beside
chrisfield
cot
and
let
the
butt
of
his
rifle
come
down
with
a
bang
on
the
floor
somebody
laughed
andrews
walked
up
to
them
a
look
of
trouble
in
his
blue
eyes
and
in
the
lines
of
his
lean
tanned
cheeks
what
the
matter
chris
he
asked
in
a
low
voice

chrisfield
in
a
broken
voice

in
an
apologetic
tone

all
his
dirty
andrews
walked
off
without
replying

jenkins
grinning
at
him
from
the
door
ah
doan
give
a
hoot
in
hell
what
they
do
said
chrisfield
again
he
lay
back
in
his
bunk
and
looked
at
the
ceiling
the
barracks
was
full
of
a
bustle
of
cleaning
up
judkins
was
sweeping
the
floor
with
a
broom
made
of
dry
sticks
another
man
was
knocking
down
the
swallows
nests
with
a
bayonet
the
mud
nests
crumbled
and
fell
on
the
floor
and
the
bunks
filling
the
air
with
a
flutter
of
feathers
and
a
smell
of
birdlime
the
little
naked
bodies
with
their
orange
bills
too
big
for
them
gave
a
soft
plump
when
they
hit
the
boards
of
the
floor
where
they
lay
giving
faint
gasping
squeaks
meanwhile
with
shrill
little
cries
the
big
swallows
flew
back
and
forth
in
the
shanty
now
and
then
striking
the
low
roof
say
pick
up
ca
yer
said
small
judkins
was
sweeping
the
little
gasping
bodies
out
among
the
dust
and
dirt
a
stoutish
man
stooped
and
picked
the
little
birds
up
one
by
one
puckering
his
lips
into
an
expression
of
tenderness
he
made
his
two
hands
into
a
hollow
out
of
which
stretched
the
long
necks
and
the
gaping
orange
mouths
andrews
ran
into
him
at
the
door
hello
dad
he
said
what
the
hell
i
just
picked
these
so
they
could
let
the
poor
little
devils
stay
there
god
it
looks
to
me
as
if
they
went
out
of
their
way
to
give
pain
to
everything
bird
beast
or
war
ai
no
picnic
said
judkins
well
god
damn
it
is
that
a
reason
for
not
going
out
of
your
way
to
raise
more
hell
with
people
feelings
than
you
have
to
a
face
with
peaked
chin
and
nose
on
which
was
stretched
a
skin
appeared
in
the
door
hello
boys
said
the
y
man
i
just
thought
i
tell
you
i
going
to
open
the
canteen
tomorrow
in
the
last
shack
on
the
beaucourt
road
there
be
chocolate
ciggies
soap
and
everybody
cheered
the
y
man
beamed
his
eye
lit
on
the
little
birds
in
dad
hands
how
could
you
he
said
an
american
soldier
being
deliberately
cruel
i
would
never
have
believed
ye
got
somethin
to
learn
muttered
dad
waddling
out
into
the
twilight
on
his
bandy
legs
chrisfield
had
been
watching
the
scene
at
the
door
with
unseeing
eyes
a
terrified
nervousness
that
he
tried
to
beat
off
had
come
over
him
it
was
useless
to
repeat
to
himself
again
and
again
that
he
did
give
a
damn
the
prospect
of
being
brought
up
alone
before
all
those
officers
of
being
by
those
curt
voices
frightened
him
he
would
rather
have
been
lashed
whatever
was
he
to
say
he
kept
asking
himself
he
would
get
mixed
up
or
say
things
he
did
mean
to
or
else
he
would
be
able
to
get
a
word
out
at
all
if
only
andy
could
go
up
with
him
andy
was
educated
like
the
officers
were
he
had
more
learning
than
the
whole
put
together
he
be
able
to
defend
himself
and
defend
his
friends
too
if
only
they
let
him
i
felt
just
like
those
little
birds
that
time
they
got
the
bead
on
our
trench
at
boticourt
said
jenkins
laughing
chrisfield
listened
to
the
talk
about
him
as
if
from
another
world
already
he
was
cut
off
from
his
outfit
he
disappear
and
they
never
know
or
care
what
became
of
him
the
blew
and
the
men
filed
out
he
could
hear
their
talk
outside
and
the
sound
of
their
as
they
opened
them
he
lay
on
his
bunk
staring
up
into
the
dark
a
faint
blue
light
still
came
from
outside
giving
a
curious
purple
color
to
small
red
face
and
long
drooping
nose
at
the
end
of
which
hung
a
glistening
drop
of
moisture
chrisfield
found
andrews
washing
a
shirt
in
the
brook
that
flowed
through
the
ruins
of
the
village
the
other
side
of
the
road
from
the
buildings
where
the
division
was
quartered
the
blue
sky
flicked
with
clouds
gave
a
shimmer
of
blue
and
lavender
and
white
to
the
bright
water
at
the
bottom
could
be
seen
battered
helmets
and
bits
of
equipment
and
tin
cans
that
had
once
held
meat
andrews
turned
his
head
he
had
a
smudge
of
mud
down
his
nose
and
soapsuds
on
his
chin
hello
chris
he
said
looking
him
in
the
eyes
with
his
sparkling
blue
eyes
how
things
there
was
a
faint
anxious
frown
on
his
forehead
of
one
month
pay
an
confined
to
quarters
said
chrisfield
cheerfully
gee
they
were
said
ah

a
good
shot

andrews
started
scrubbing

feet
and
wiped

mud
off
his
nose
with
his
bare
forearm

chrisfield

shirt

of
a
lot
of
artillery
going
up
the
road
french
british
every
old
tell
me
they
raisin
hell
in
the
oregon
they
walked
slowly
across
the
road
a
motorcycle
whizzed
past
them
it
them
guys
has
the
fun
said
chrisfield
i
do
believe
anybody
has
what
about
the
officers
they
too
busy
feeling
important
to
have
a
real
hell
of
a
the
hard
cold
rain
beat
like
a
lash
in
his
face
there
was
no
light
anywhere
and
no
sound
but
the
hiss
of
the
rain
in
the
grass
his
eyes
strained
to
see
through
the
dark
until
red
and
yellow
blotches
danced
before
them
he
walked
very
slowly
and
carefully
holding
something
very
gently
in
his
hand
under
his
raincoat
he
felt
himself
full
of
a
strange
subdued
fury
he
seemed
to
be
walking
behind
himself
spying
on
his
own
actions
and
what
he
saw
made
him
feel
joyously
happy
made
him
want
to
sing
he
turned
so
that
the
rain
beat
against
his
cheek
under
his
helmet
he
felt
his
hair
full
of
sweat
that
ran
with
the
rain
down
his
glowing
face
his
fingers
clutched
very
carefully
the
smooth
stick
he
had
in
his
hand
he
stopped
and
shut
his
eyes
for
a
moment
through
the
hiss
of
the
rain
he
had
heard
a
sound
of
men
talking
in
one
of
the
shanties
when
he
shut
his
eyes
he
saw
the
white
face
of
anderson
before
him
with
its
unshaven
chin
and
the
eyebrows
that
met
across
the
nose
suddenly
he
felt
the
wall
of
a
house
in
front
of
him
he
put
out
his
hand
his
hand
jerked
back
from
the
rough
wet
feel
of
the
tar
paper
as
if
it
had
touched
something
dead
he
groped
along
the
wall
stepping
very
cautiously
he
felt
as
he
had
felt
reconnoitering
in
the
bringy
wood
phrases
came
to
his
mind
as
they
had
then
without
thinking
what
they
meant
the
words
make
the
world
safe
for
democracy
formed
themselves
in
his
head
they
were
very
comforting
they
occupied
his
thoughts
he
said
them
to
himself
again
and
again
meanwhile
his
free
hand
was
fumbling
very
carefully
with
the
fastening
that
held
the
wooden
shutter
over
a
window
the
shutter
opened
a
very
little
creaking
loudly
louder
than
the
patter
of
rain
on
the
roof
of
the
shack
a
stream
of
water
from
the
roof
was
pouring
into
his
face
suddenly
a
beam
of
light
transformed
everything
cutting
the
darkness
in
two
the
rain
glittered
like
a
bead
curtain
chrisfield
was
looking
into
a
little
room
where
a
lamp
was
burning
at
a
table
covered
with
printed
blanks
of
different
size
sat
a
corporal
behind
him
was
a
bunk
and
a
pile
of
equipment
the
corporal
was
reading
a
magazine
chrisfield
looked
at
him
a
long
time
his
fingers
were
tight
about
the
smooth
stick
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
room
a
sort
of
panic
seized
chrisfield
he
strode
away
noisily
from
the
window
and
pushed
open
the
door
of
the
shack
where
sergeant
anderson
he
asked
in
a
breathless
voice
of
the
first
man
he
saw
corp
there
if
it
anything
important
said
the
man
gone
to
an
left
day
before
chrisfield
was
out
in
the
rain
again
it
was
beating
straight
in
his
face
so
that
his
eyes
were
full
of
water
he
was
trembling
he
had
suddenly
become
terrified
the
smooth
stick
he
held
seemed
to
burn
him
he
was
straining
his
ears
for
an
explosion
walking
straight
before
him
down
the
road
he
went
faster
and
faster
as
if
trying
to
escape
from
it
he
stumbled
on
a
pile
of
stones
automatically
he
pulled
the
string
out
of
the
grenade
and
threw
it
far
from
him
there
was
a
minute
pause
red
flame
spurted
in
the
middle
of
the
wheatfield
he
felt
the
sharp
crash
in
his
eardrums
he
walked
fast
through
the
rain
behind
him
at
the
door
of
the
shack
he
could
hear
excited
voices
he
walked
recklessly
on
the
rain
blinding
him
when
he
finally
stepped
into
the
light
he
was
so
dazzled
he
could
not
see
who
was
in
the
wine
shop
well
i
be
damned
chris
said
andrews
voice
chrisfield
blinked
the
rain
out
of
his
lashes
andrews
sat
writing
with
a
pile
of
papers
before
him
and
a
bottle
of
champagne
it
seemed
to
chrisfield
to
soothe
his
nerves
to
hear
andy
voice
he
wished
he
would
go
on
talking
a
long
time
without
a
pause
if
you
are
the
crowning
idiot
of
the
ages
andrews
went
on
in
a
low
voice
he
took
chrisfield
by
the
arm
and
led
him
into
the
little
back
room
where
was
a
high
bed
with
a
brown
coverlet
and
a
big
kitchen
table
on
which
were
the
remnants
of
a
meal
what
the
matter
your
arm
trembling
like
the
devil
but
why
o
pardon
crimpette
un
ami
you
know
crimpette
do
you
he
pointed
to
a
youngish
woman
who
had
just
appeared
from
behind
the
bed
she
had
a
flabby
rosy
face
and
violet
circles
under
her
eyes
dark
as
if
they
been
made
by
blows
and
untidy
hair
a
dirty
grey
muslin
dress
with
half
the
hooks
off
held
in
badly
her
large
breasts
and
flabby
figure
chrisfield
looked
at
her
greedily
feeling
his
furious
irritation
flame
into
one
desire
what
the
matter
with
you
chris
you
crazy
to
break
out
of
quarters
this
way
say
andy
git
out
o
here
ah
ai
your
sort
anyway
git
out
you
a
wild
man
i
grant
you
that
but
i
just
as
soon
be
your
sort
as
anyone
else
have
a
not
andrews
sat
down
with
his
bottle
and
his
papers
pushing
away
the
broken
plates
full
of
stale
food
to
make
a
place
on
the
greasy
table
he
took
a
gulp
out
of
the
bottle
that
made
him
cough
then
put
the
end
of
his
pencil
in
his
mouth
and
stared
gravely
at
the
paper
no
i
your
sort
chris
he
said
over
his
shoulder
only
tamed
me
o
god
how
tame
i
chrisfield
did
not
listen
to
what
he
was
saying
he
stood
in
front
of
the
woman
staring
in
her
face
she
looked
at
him
in
a
stupid
frightened
way
he
felt
in
his
pockets
for
some
money
as
he
had
just
been
paid
he
had
a
note
he
spread
it
out
carefully
before
her
her
eyes
glistened
the
pupils
seemed
to
grow
smaller
as
they
fastened
on
the
bit
of
daintily
colored
paper
he
crumpled
it
up
suddenly
in
his
fist
and
shoved
it
down
between
her
breasts
some
time
later
chrisfield
sat
down
in
front
of
andrews
he
still
had
his
wet
slicker
on
ah
guess
you
think
ah
a
swine
he
said
in
his
normal
voice
ah
guess
you
about
no
i
do
said
andrews
something
made
him
put
his
hand
on
chrisfield
hand
that
lay
on
the
table
it
had
a
feeling
of
cool
health
say
why
were
you
trembling
so
when
you
came
in
here
you
seem
all
right
oh
ah
dunno
said
chrisfield
in
a
soft
resonant
voice
they
were
silent
for
a
long
while
they
could
hear
the
woman
footsteps
going
and
coming
behind
them
let
go
home
said
chrisfield
all
right
bonsoir
outside
the
rain
had
stopped
a
stormy
wind
had
torn
the
clouds
to
rags
here
and
there
clusters
of
stars
showed
through
they
splashed
merrily
through
the
puddles
but
here
and
there
reflected
a
patch
of
stars
when
the
wind
was
not
ruffling
them
christ
ah
wish
ah
was
like
you
andy
said
chrisfield
you

chris

feel
as
they
slipped
in
the
door
of
their
quarters
the
sergeant
looked
at
chrisfield
searchingly
andrews
spoke
up
at
once
there
some
rumors
going
on
at
the
latrine
sarge
the
fellows
from
the
say
we

andrews
be
before
thursday
or
i
a
sergeant
higgins
put
on
a
great
air
of
mystery
chrisfield
went
to
his
bunk
undressed
quietly
and
climbed
into
his
blankets
he
stretched
his
arms
languidly
a
couple
of
times
and
while
andrews
was
still
talking
to
the
sergeant
fell
asleep
iv
the
moon
lay
among
clouds
on
the
horizon
like
a
big
red
pumpkin
among
its
leaves
chrisfield
squinted
at
it
through
the
boughs
of
the
apple
trees
laden
with
apples
that
gave
a
winey
fragrance
to
the
crisp
air
he
was
sitting
on
the
ground
his
legs
stretched
limply
before
him
leaning
against
the
rough
trunk
of
an
apple
tree
opposite
him
leaning
against
another
tree
was
the
square
form
surmounted
by
a
large
face
of
judkins
between
them
lay
two
empty
cognac
bottles
all
about
them
was
the
rustling
orchard
with
its
crooked
twigs
that
made
a
crackling
sound
rubbing
together
in
the
gusts
of
the
autumn
wind
that
came
heavy
with
a
smell
of
damp
woods
and
of
rotting
fruits
and
of
all
the
ferment
of
the
overripe
fields
chrisfield
felt
it
stirring
the
moist
hair
on
his
forehead
and
through
the
buzzing
haze
of
the
cognac
heard
the
plunk
plunk
plunk
of
apples
dropping
that
followed
each
gust
and
the
twanging
of
night
insects
and
far
in
the
distance
the
endless
rumble
of
guns
like
tomtoms
beaten
for
a
dance
ye
heard
what
the
colonel
said
did
ye
said
judkins
in
a
voice
hoarse
from
too
much
drink
chrisfield
belched
and
nodded
his
head
vaguely
he
remembered
white
fury
after
the
men
had
been
dismissed
how
he
had
sat
down
on
the
end
of
a
log
by
the
field
kitchen
staring
at
the
patch
of
earth
he
beat
into
mud
with
the
toe
of
his
boot
then
went
on
judkins
trying
to
imitate
the
colonel
solemn
efficient
voice
the
subject
of
prisoners
he
hiccoughed
and
made
a
limp
gesture
with
his
hand
the
subject
of
prisoners
well
leave
that
to
you
but
juss
remember
juss
remember
what
the
huns
did
to
belgium
an
i
might
add
that

barely
enough
emergency
rations
as
it
is
and
the
more
prisoners

the
less

fellers

eat
that
what
he
said
judkie
that
what
he
the
more
prisoners

the
less

chanted
judkins
making
a
triumphal
flourish
with
his
hand
chrisfield
groped
for
the
cognac
bottle
it
was
empty
he
waved
it
in
the
air
a
minute
and
then
threw
it
into
the
tree
opposite
him
a
shower
of
little
apples
fell
about
judkins
head
he
got
unsteadily
to
his
feet
i
tell
you
fellers
he
said
war
ai
no
chrisfield
stood
up
and
grabbed
at
an
apple
his
teeth
crunched
into
it
sweet
he
said
sweet
nauthin
mumbled
judkins
war
ai
no
picnic
i
tell
you
buddy
if

he
hiccoughed
after
what
the
colonel
said
i

spots
out
of
you
by
god
i
will
rip
up
their
guts
that
all
like

their
his
voice
suddenly
changed
to
one
of
childish
dismay
gee
chris
i
going
to
be
sick
he
whispered
look
out
said
chrisfield
pushing
him
away
judkins
leaned
against
a
tree
and
vomited
the
full
moon
had
risen
above
the
clouds
and
filled
the
apple
orchard
with
chilly
golden
light
that
cast
a
fantastic
shadow
pattern
of
interlaced
twigs
and
branches
upon
the
bare
ground
littered
with
apples
the
sound
of
the
guns
had
grown
nearer
there
were
loud
eager
rumbles
as
of
bowls
being
rolled
very
hard
on
a
bowling
alley
combined
with
a
continuous
roar
like
sheets
of
iron
being
shaken
ah

hell

chrisfield
i

judkins

judkins

they
were
walking
at
random
through
the
orchard
they
came
to
a
field
full
of
big
pumpkins
that
gleamed
in
the
moonlight
and
cast
shadows
black
as
holes
in
the
distance
they
could
see
wooded
hills
chrisfield
picked
up
a
pumpkin
and
threw
it
as
hard
as
he
could
into
the
air
it
split
into
three
when
it
landed
with
a
thud
on
the
ground
and
the
moist
yellow
seeds
spilled
out
some
strong
man
you
are
said
judkins
tossing
up
a
bigger
one
say
there
a
farmhouse
maybe
we
could
get
some
aigs
from
the
hell
of
a
lot
of
hens
at
that
moment
the
crowing
of
a
rooster
came
across
the
silent
fields
they
ran
towards
the
dark
farm
buildings
look
out
there
may
be
officers
quartered
they
walked
cautiously
round
the
square
silent
group
of
buildings
there
were
no
lights
the
big
wooden
door
of
the
court
pushed
open
easily
without
creaking
on
the
roof
of
the
barn
the
was
etched
dark
against
the
disc
of
the
moon
a
warm
smell
of
stables
blew
in
their
faces
as
the
two
men
tiptoed
into
the
farmyard
under
one
of
the
sheds
they
found
a
table
on
which
a
great
many
pears
were
set
to
ripen
chrisfield
put
his
teeth
into
one
the
rich
sweet
juice
ran
down
his
chin
he
ate
the
pear
quickly
and
greedily
and
then
bit
into
another
fill
yer
pockets
with
whispered
judkins

pushed
open

door
of
one
of
the
barns
a
smell
of
creamy
milk
and
cheeses
filled
his
nostrils
come
here
he
whispered
want
some
cheese
a
lot
of
cheeses
ranged
on
a
board
shone
silver
in
the
moonlight
that
came
in
through
the
open
door
hell

judkins
pushing
his
heavy

into
one
of
the
new
soft
cheeses

the
huns
but

that
all
said
judkins
in
the
next
door
they
found
chickens
roosting
in
a
small
room
with
straw
on
the
floor
the
chickens
ruffled
their
feathers
and
made
a
muffled
squeaking
as
they
slept
suddenly
there
was
a
loud
squawking
and
all
the
chickens
were
cackling
with
terror
beat
it
muttered
judkins
running
for
the
gate
of
the
farmyard
there
were
shrill
cries
of
women
in
the
house
a
voice
shrieking
les
boches
les
boches
rose
above
the
cackling
of
chickens
and
the
clamor
of
as
they
ran
they
heard
the
rasping
cries
of
a
woman
in
hysterics
rending
the
rustling
autumn
night
god
damn
said
judkins
breathless
they
ai
got
no
right
those
frogs
ai
to
carry
on
like
they
ducked
into
the
orchard
again
above
the
squawking
of
the
chicken
judkins
still
held
swinging
it
by
its
legs
chrisfield
could
hear
the
woman
voice
shrieking
judkins
dexterously
wrung
the
chicken
neck
crushing
the
apples
underfoot
they
strode
fast
through
the
orchard
the
voice
faded
into
the
distance
until
it
could
not
be
heard
above
the
sound
of
the
guns
gee
ah

judkins
swung
the
chicken
by
its
neck
round
his
head
and
threw
it
as
hard
as
he
could
into
the
bushes
they
were
walking
along
the
road
between
chestnut
trees
that
led
to
their
village
it
was
dark
except
for
irregular
patches
of
bright
moonlight
in
the
centre
that
lay
white
as
milk
among
the
indentated
shadows
of
the
leaves
all
about
them
rose
a
cool
scent
of
woods
of
ripe
fruits
and
of
decaying
leaves
of
the
ferment
of
the
autumn
countryside
the
lieutenant
sat
at
a
table
in
the
sun
in
the
village
street
outside
the
company
office
in
front
of
him
sparkled
piles
of
money
and
daintily
tinted
banknotes
beside
him
stood
sergeant
higgins
with
an
air
of
solemnity
and
the
second
sergeant
and
the
corporal
the
men
stood
in
line
and
as
each
came
before
the
table
he
saluted
with
deference
received
his
money
and
walked
away
with
a
air
a
few
villagers
looked
on
from
the
small
windows
with
grey
frames
of
their
rambling
whitewashed
houses
in
the
ruddy
sunshine
the
line
of
men
cast
an
irregular
shadow
like
a
gigantic
centipede
on
the
yellow
gravel
road
from
the
table
by
the
window
of
the
cafe
of
nos
braves
poilus
where
small
and
judkins
and
chrisfield
had
established
themselves
with
their
pay
crisp
in
their
pockets
they
could
see
the
little
front
garden
of
the
house
across
the
road
where
behind
a
hedge
of
orange
marigolds
andrews
sat
on
the
doorstep
talking
to
an
old
woman
hunched
on
a
low
chair
in
the
sun
just
inside
the
door
who
leant
her
small
white
head
over
towards
his
yellow
one
there
ye
are
said
judkins
in
a
solemn
tone
he
do
even
go
after
his
pay
that
guy
thinks
he
the
whole
show
he
chrisfield
flushed
but
said
nothing
he
do
do
nothing
all
day
long
but
talk
to
that
ole
lady
said
small
with
a
grin
guess
she
reminds
him
of
his
mother
or
he
always
does
go
round
with
the
frogs
all
he
can
looks
to
me
like
he
rather
have
a
drink
with
a
frog
than
with
an
reckon
he
wants
to
learn
their
language
said
small
he
wo
never
come
to
much
in
this
army
that
what
i
telling
yer
said
judkins
the
little
houses
across
the
way
had
flushed
red
with
the
sunset
andrews
got
to
his
feet
slowly
and
languidly
and
held
out
his
hand
to
the
old
woman
she
stood
up
a
small
tottering
figure
in
a
black
silk
shawl
he
leaned
over
towards
her
and
she
kissed
both
his
cheeks
vigorously
several
times
he
walked
down
the
road
towards
the
billets
with
his
fatigue
cap
in
his
hand
looking
at
the
ground
he
got
a
flower
behind
his
ear
like
a
cigarette
said
judkins
with
a
disgusted
snort
well
i
guess
we
better
go
said
small
we
got
to
be
in
quarters
at
they
were
silent
a
moment
in
the
distance
the
guns
kept
up
a
continual
tomtom
sound
guess
we
be
in
that
soon
said
small
chrisfield
felt
a
chill
go
down
his
spine
he
moistened
his
lips
with
his
tongue
guess
it
hell
out
there
said
judkins
war
ai
no
ah
doan
give
a
hoot
in
hell
said
chrisfield
the
men
were
lined
up
in
the
village
street
with
their
packs
on
waiting
for
the
order
to
move
thin
wreaths
of
white
mist
still
lingered
in
the
trees
and
over
the
little
garden
plots
the
sun
had
not
yet
risen
but
ranks
of
clouds
in
the
pale
blue
sky
overhead
were
brilliant
with
crimson
and
gold
the
men
stood
in
an
irregular
line
bent
over
a
little
by
the
weight
of
their
equipment
moving
back
and
forth
stamping
their
feet
and
beating
their
arms
together
their
noses
and
ears
red
from
the
chill
of
the
morning
the
haze
of
their
breath
rose
above
their
heads
down
the
misty
road
a
limousine
appeared
running
slowly
it
stopped
in
front
of
the
line
of
men
the
lieutenant
came
hurriedly
out
of
the
house
opposite
drawing
on
a
pair
of
gloves
the
men
standing
in
line
looked
curiously
at
the
limousine
they
could
see
that
two
of
the
tires
were
flat
and
that
the
glass
was
broken
there
were
scratches
on
the
drab
paint
and
in
the
door
three
long
jagged
holes
that
obliterated
the
number
a
little
murmur
went
down
the
line
of
men
the
door
opened
with
difficulty
and
a
major
in
a
light
coat
stumbled
out
one
arm
wrapped
in
bloody
bandages
was
held
in
a
sling
made
of
a
handkerchief
his
face
was
white
and
drawn
into
a
stiff
mask
with
pain
the
lieutenant
saluted
for
god
sake
where
a
repair
station
he
asked
in
a
loud
shaky
voice
there
none
in
this
village
where
the
hell
is
there
one
i

said
the
lieutenant
in
a
humble
tone
why

hell

organization

major
stanley

killed
what

hell

where
the
hell
that
the
chauffeur
had

he
had
no
cap
and
his
hair
was
full
of
dust

lootenant

the
major
the
billeting
officer
has
a
map
said
the
lieutenant
last
house
to
the
o
let
go
there
quick
said
the
major
he
fumbled
with
the
fastening
of
the
door
the
lieutenant
opened
it
for
him
as
he
opened
the
door
the
men
nearest
had
a
glimpse
of
the
interior
of
the
car
on
the
far
side
was
a
long
object
huddled
in
blankets
propped
up
on
the
seat
before
he
got
in
the
major
leaned
over
and
pulled
a
woollen
rug
out
holding
it
away
from
him
with
his
one
good
arm
the
car
moved
off
slowly
and
all
down
the
village
street
the
men
lined
up
waiting
for
orders
stared
curiously
at
the
three
jagged
holes
in
the
door
the
lieutenant
looked
at
the
rug
that
lay
in
the
middle
of
the
road
he
touched
it
with
his
foot
it
was
soaked
with
blood
that
in
places
had
dried
into
clots
the
lieutenant
and
the
men
of
his
company
looked
at
it
in
silence
the
sun
had
risen
and
shone
on
the
roofs
of
the
little
whitewashed
houses
behind
them
far
down
the
road
a
regiment
had
begun
to
move
v
at
the
brow
of
the
hill
they
rested
chrisfield
sat
on
the
red
clay
bank
and
looked
about
him
his
rifle
between
his
knees
in
front
of
him
on
the
side
of
the
road
was
a
french
burying
ground
where
the
little
wooden
crosses
tilting
in
every
direction
stood
up
against
the
sky
and
the
bead
wreaths
glistened
in
the
warm
sunlight
all
down
the
road
as
far
as
he
could
see
was
a
long
drab
worm
broken
in
places
by
strings
of
motor
trucks
a
drab
worm
that
wriggled
down
the
slope
through
the
roofless
shell
of
the
village
and
up
into
the
shattered
woods
on
the
crest
of
the
next
hills
chrisfield
strained
his
eyes
to
see
the
hills
beyond
they
lay
blue
and
very
peaceful
in
the
moon
mist
the
river
glittered
about
the
piers
of
the
wrecked
stone
bridge
and
disappeared
between
rows
of
yellow
poplars
somewhere
in
the
valley
a
big
gun
fired
the
shell
shrieked
into
the
distance
towards
the
blue
peaceful
hills
chrisfield
regiment
was
moving
again
the
men
their
feet
slipping
in
the
clayey
mud
went
downhill
with
long
strides
the
straps
of
their
packs
tugging
at
their
shoulders
is
this
great
country
said
andrews
who
marched
beside
him
ah
liever
be
at
an
like
that
bastard
oh
to
hell
with
that
said
andrews
he
still
had
a
big
faded
orange
marigold
in
one
of
the
buttonholes
of
his
soiled
tunic
he
walked
with
his
nose
in
the
air
and
his
nostrils
dilated
enjoying
the
tang
of
the
autumnal
sunlight
chrisfield
took
the
cigarette
that
had
gone
out
from
his
mouth
and
spat
savagely
at
the
heels
of
the
man
in
front
of
him
this
ai
no
life
for
a
white
man
he
said
i
rather
be
this
than
than
that
said
andrews
bitterly
he
tossed
his
head
in
the
direction
of
a
staff
car
full
of
officers
that
was
stalled
at
the
side
of
the
road
they
were
drinking
something
out
of
a
thermos
bottle
that
they
passed
round
with
the
air
of
sunday
excursionists
they
waved
with
a
conscious
relaxation
of
discipline
at
the
men
as
they
passed
one
a
little
lieutenant
with
a
black
mustache
with
pointed
ends
kept
crying
they
running
like
rabbits
fellers
they
running
like
a
wavering
would
come
from
the
column
now
and
then
where
it
was
passing
the
staff
car
the
big
gun
fired
again
chrisfield
was
near
it
this
time
and
felt
the
concussion
like
a

said
the
man
behind
him
someone
was
singing

with
your

cut
just
as
short
as
everybody
took
it
up
their
steps
rang
in
rhythm
in
the
paved
street
that
zigzagged
among
the
smashed
houses
of
the
village
ambulances
passed
them
big
trucks
full
of
huddled
men
with
grey
faces
from
which
came
a
smell
of
sweat
and
blood
and
carbolic
somebody
went
on
o
ashes
to
ashes
an
dust
to
dust
can
that
cried
judkins
it
ai
but
everybody
had
taken
up
the
song
chrisfield
noticed
that
eyes
were
sparkling
if
he
ai
the
damnedest
he
thought
to
himself
but
he
shouted
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
with
the
rest
o
ashes
to
ashes
an
dust
to
dust
if
the
gasbombs
do

the
they
were
climbing
the
hill
again
the
road
was
worn
into
deep
ruts
and
there
were
many
shell
holes
full
of
muddy
water
into
which
their
feet
slipped
the
woods
began
a
shattered
skeleton
of
woods
full
of
old
artillery
emplacements
and
dugouts
where
torn
camouflage
fluttered
from
splintered
trees
the
ground
and
the
road
were
littered
with
tin
cans
and
brass
along
both
sides
of
the
road
the
trees
were
festooned
as
with
creepers
with
strand
upon
strand
of
telephone
wire
when
next
they
stopped
chrisfield
was
on
the
crest
of
the
hill
beside
a
battery
of
french
he
looked
curiously
at
the
frenchmen
who
sat
about
on
logs
in
their
pink
and
blue
shirtsleeves
playing
cards
and
smoking
their
gestures
irritated
him
say
tell
we
advancin
he
said
to
andrews
are
we
said
andrews
all
right
les
boches
comme
des
lapins
he
shouted
one
of
the
men
turned
his
head
and
laughed
he
says
they
been
running
that
way
for
four
years
said
andrews
he
slipped
his
pack
off
sat
down
on
it
and
fished
for
a
cigarette
chrisfield
took
off
his
helmet
and
rubbed
a
muddy
hand
through
his
hair
he
took
a
bite
of
chewing
tobacco
and
sat
with
his
hands
clasped
over
his
knees
how
the
hell
long
are
we
going
to
wait
this
time
he
muttered
the
shadows
of
the
tangled
and
splintered
trees
crept
slowly
across
the
road
the
french
artillerymen
were
eating
their
supper
a
long
train
of
motor
trucks
growled
past
splashing
mud
over
the
men
crowded
along
the
sides
of
the
road
the
sun
set
and
a
lot
of
batteries
down
in
the
valley
began
firing
making
it
impossible
to
talk
the
air
was
full
of
a
shrieking
and
droning
of
shells
overhead
the
frenchmen
stretched
and
yawned
and
went
down
into
their
dugout
chrisfield
watched
them
enviously
the
stars
were
beginning
to
come
out
in
the
green
sky
behind
the
tall
lacerated
trees
chrisfield
legs
ached
with
cold
he
began
to
get
crazily
anxious
for
something
to
happen
for
something
to
happen
but
the
column
waited
without
moving
through
the
gathering
darkness
chrisfield
chewed
steadily
trying
to
think
of
nothing
but
the
taste
of
the
tobacco
in
his
mouth
the
column
was
moving
again
as
they
reached
the
brow
of
another
hill
chrisfield
felt
a
curious
sweetish
smell
that
made
his
nostrils
smart
gas
he
thought
full
of
panic
and
put
his
hand
to
the
mask
that
hung
round
his
neck
but
he
did
not
want
to
be
the
first
to
put
it
on
no
order
came
he
marched
on
cursing
the
sergeant
and
the
lieutenant
but
maybe
they
been
killed
by
it
he
had
a
vision
of
the
whole
regiment
sinking
down
in
the
road
suddenly
overcome
by
the
gas
smell
anythin
andy
he
whispered
cautiously
i
can
smell
a
combination
of
dead
horses
and
tube
roses
and
banana
oil
and
the
ice
cream
we
used
to
have
at
college
and
dead
rats
in
the
garret
but
what
the
hell
do
we
care
now
said
andrews
giggling
this
is
the
damnedest
fool
business
ever
he
crazy
muttered
chrisfield
to
himself
he
looked
at
the
stars
in
the
black
sky
that
seemed
to
be
going
along
with
the
column
on
its
march
or
was
it
that
they
and
the
stars
were
standing
still
while
the
trees
moved
away
from
them
waving
their
skinny
shattered
arms
he
could
hardly
hear
the
tramp
of
feet
on
the
road
so
loud
was
the
pandemonium
of
the
guns
ahead
and
behind
every
now
and
then
a
rocket
would
burst
in
front
of
them
and
its
red
and
green
lights
would
mingle
for
a
moment
with
the
stars
but
it
was
only
overhead
he
could
see
the
stars
everywhere
else
white
and
red
glows
rose
and
fell
as
if
the
horizon
were
on
fire
as
they
started
down
the
slope
the
trees
suddenly
broke
away
and
they
saw
the
valley
between
them
full
of
the
glare
of
guns
and
the
white
light
of
star
shells
it
was
like
looking
into
a
stove
full
of
glowing
embers
the
hillside
that
sloped
away
from
them
was
full
of
crashing
detonations
and
yellow
tongues
of
flame
in
a
battery
near
the
road
that
seemed
to
crush
their
skulls
each
time
a
gun
fired
they
could
see
the
dark
forms
of
the
artillerymen
silhouetted
in
fantastic
attitudes
against
the
intermittent
red
glare
stunned
and
blinded
they
kept
on
marching
down
the
road
it
seemed
to
chrisfield
that
they
were
going
to
step
any
minute
into
the
flaring
muzzle
of
a
gun
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
beside
a
little
grove
of
uninjured
trees
they
stopped
again
a
new
train
of
trucks
was
crawling
past
them
huge
blots
in
the
darkness
there
were
no
batteries
near
so
they
could
hear
the
grinding
roar
of
the
gears
as
the
trucks
went
along
the
uneven
road
plunging
in
and
out
of
shellholes
chrisfield
lay
down
in
the
dry
ditch
full
of
bracken
and
dozed
with
his
head
on
his
pack
all
about
him
were
stretched
other
men
someone
was
resting
his
head
on
chrisfield
thigh
the
noise
had
subsided
a
little
through
his
doze
he
could
hear
men
voices
talking
in
low
crushed
tones
as
if
they
were
afraid
of
speaking
aloud
on
the
road
the
kept
calling
out
to
each
other
shrilly
raspingly
the
motors
stopped
running
one
after
another
making
almost
a
silence
during
which
chrisfield
fell
asleep
something
woke
him
he
was
stiff
with
cold
and
terrified
for
a
moment
he
thought
he
had
been
left
alone
that
the
company
had
gone
on
for
there
was
no
one
touching
him
overhead
was
a
droning
as
of
gigantic
mosquitoes
growing
fast
to
a
loud
throbbing
he
heard
the
lieutenant
voice
calling
shrilly
sergeant
higgins
sergeant
higgins
the
lieutenant
stood
out
suddenly
black
against
a
sheet
of
flame
chrisfield
could
see
his
fatigue
cap
a
little
on
one
side
and
his
trench
coat
drawn
in
tight
at
the
waist
and
sticking
out
stiffly
at
the
knees
he
was
shaken
by
the
explosion
everything
was
black
again
chrisfield
got
to
his
feet
his
ears
ringing
the
column
was
moving
on
he
heard
moaning
near
him
in
the
darkness
the
tramp
of
feet
and
jingle
of
equipment
drowned
all
other
sound
he
could
feel
his
shoulders
becoming
raw
under
the
tugging
of
the
pack
now
and
then
the
flare
from
aeroplane
bombs
behind
him
showed
up
wrecked
trucks
on
the
side
of
the
road
somewhere
a
machine
gun
spluttered
but
the
column
tramped
on
weighed
down
by
the
packs
by
the
deadening
exhaustion
the
turbulent
flaring
darkness
was
calming
to
the
grey
of
dawn
when
chrisfield
stopped
marching
his
eyelids
stung
as
if
his
eyeballs
were
flaming
hot
he
could
not
feel
his
feet
and
legs
the
guns
continued
incessantly
like
a
hammer
beating
on
his
head
he
was
walking
very
slowly
in
a
single
file
now
and
then
stumbling
against
the
man
ahead
of
him
there
was
earth
on
both
sides
of
him
clay
walls
that
dripped
moisture
all
at
once
he
stumbled
down
some
steps
into
a
dugout
where
it
was
an
unfamiliar
smell
struck
him
made
him
uneasy
but
his
thoughts
seemed
to
reach
him
from
out
of
a
great
distance
he
groped
to
the
wall
his
knees
struck
against
a
bunk
with
blankets
in
it
in
another
second
he
was
sunk
fathoms
deep
in
sleep
when
he
woke
up
his
mind
was
very
clear
the
roof
of
the
dugout
was
of
logs
a
bright
spot
far
away
was
the
door
he
hoped
desperately
that
he
was
on
duty
he
wondered
where
andy
was
then
he
remembered
that
andy
was
crazy
a
yeller
dawg
judkins
had
called
him
sitting
up
with
difficulty
he
undid
his
shoes
and
puttees
wrapped
himself
in
his
blanket
all
round
him
were
snores
and
the
deep
breathing
of
exhausted
sleep
he
closed
his
eyes
he
was
being
he
stood
with
his
hands
at
his
sides
before
three
officers
at
a
table
all
three
had
the
same
white
faces
with
heavy
blue
jaws
and
eyebrows
that
met
above
the
nose
they
were
reading
things
out
of
papers
aloud
but
although
he
strained
his
ears
he
could
make
out
what
they
were
saying
all
he
could
hear
was
a
faint
moaning
something
had
a
curious
unfamiliar
smell
that
troubled
him
he
could
not
stand
still
at
attention
although
the
angry
eyes
of
officers
stared
at
him
from
all
round
anderson
sergeant
anderson
what
that
smell
he
kept
asking
in
a
small
whining
voice
please
tell
a
feller
what
that
smell
but
the
three
officers
at
the
table
kept
reading
from
their
papers
and
the
moaning
grew
louder
and
louder
in
his
ears
until
he
shrieked
aloud
there
was
a
grenade
in
his
hand
he
pulled
the
string
out
and
threw
it
and
he
saw
the
lieutenant
trench
coat
stand
out
against
a
sheet
of
flame
someone
sprang
at
him
he
was
wrestling
for
his
life
with
anderson
who
turned
into
a
woman
with
huge
flabby
breasts
he
crushed
her
to
him
and
turned
to
defend
himself
against
three
officers
who
came
at
him
their
trench
coats
drawn
in
tightly
at
the
waist
until
they
looked
like
wasps
everything
faded
he
woke
up
his
nostrils
were
still
full
of
the
strange
troubling
smell
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bunk
wriggling
in
his
clothes
for
his
body
crawled
with
lice
gee
it
funny
to
be
in
where
the
fritzies
were
not
long
ago
he
heard
a
voice
say
kiddo
we
advancin
came
another
voice
but
hell

kind
of
an
advance

said
chrisfield
getting
suddenly
to
his
feet
sergeant
higgins
head
appeared
in
the
door
fall
in
he
shouted
then
he
added
in
his
normal
voice
it
up
and
at
chrisfield
caught
his
puttee
on
a
clump
of
briars
at
the
edge
of
the
clearing
and
stood
kicking
his
leg
back
and
forth
to
get
it
free
at
last
he
broke
away
the
torn
puttee
dragging
behind
him
out
in
the
sunlight
in
the
middle
of
the
clearing
he
saw
a
man
in
kneeling
beside
something
on
the
ground
a
german
lay
face
down
with
a
red
hole
in
his
back
the
man
was
going
through
his
pockets
he
looked
up
into
chrisfield
face
souvenirs
he
said
what
outfit
are

buddy
said
the
man
getting
to
his
feet
slowly
where
the
hell
are
we
damned
if
i
the
clearing
was
empty
except
for
the
two
americans
and
the
german
with
the
hole
in
his
back
in
the
distance
they
heard
a
sound
of
artillery
and
nearer
the
put
put
put
of
isolated
machine
guns
the
leaves
of
the
trees
about
them
all
shades
of
brown
and
crimson
and
yellow
danced
in
the
sunlight
say
that
damn
money
ai
no
good

it
asked
chrisfield
german
money
hell
no
i
got
a
watch
that
a
peach
the
man
held
out
a
gold
watch
looking
suspiciously
at
chrisfield
all
the
while
through
eyes
ah
saw
a
feller
had
a
sword
said
chrisfield
where
that
back
there
in
the
wood
he
waved
his
hand
vaguely
ah
got
to
find
ma
outfit
comin
along
chrisfield
started
towards
the
other
edge
of
the
clearing
looks
to
me
all
right
here
said
the
other
man
lying
down
on
the
grass
in
the
sun
the
leaves
rustled
underfoot
as
chrisfield
strode
through
the
wood
he
was
frightened
by
being
alone
he
walked
ahead
as
fast
as
he
could
his
puttee
still
dragging
behind
him
he
came
to
a
entanglement
half
embedded
in
fallen
beech
leaves
it
had
been
partly
cut
in
one
place
but
in
crossing
he
tore
his
thigh
on
a
barb
taking
off
the
torn
puttee
he
wrapped
it
round
the
outside
of
his
trousers
and
kept
on
walking
feeling
a
little
blood
trickle
down
his
leg
later
he
came
to
a
lane
that
cut
straight
through
the
wood
where
there
were
many
ruts
through
the
mud
puddles
down
the
lane
in
a
patch
of
sunlight
he
saw
a
figure
towards
which
he
hurried
it
was
a
young
man
with
red
hair
and
a
face
by
a
gold
bar
on
the
collar
of
his
shirt
chrisfield
saw
that
he
was
a
lieutenant
he
had
no
coat
or
hat
and
there
was
greenish
slime
all
over
the
front
of
his
clothes
as
if
he
had
lain
on
his
belly
in
a
mud
puddle
where
you
going
dunno
all
right
come
the
lieutenant
started
walking
as
fast
as
he
could
up
the
lane
swinging
his
arms
wildly
seen
any
nests
not
a
he
followed
the
lieutenant
who
walked
so
fast
he
had
difficulty
keeping
up
splashing
recklessly
through
the
puddles
where
the
artillery
that
what
i
want
to
know
cried
the
lieutenant
suddenly
stopping
in
his
tracks
and
running
a
hand
through
his
red
hair
where
the
hell
the
artillery
he
looked
at
chrisfield
savagely
out
of
green
eyes
no
use
advancing
without
he
started
walking
faster
than
ever
all
at
once
they
saw
sunlight
ahead
of
them
and
uniforms
machine
guns
started
firing
all
around
them
in
a
sudden
gust
chrisfield
found
himself
running
forward
across
a
field
full
of
stubble
and
sprouting
clover
among
a
group
of
men
he
did
not
know
the
sound
of
rifles
had
chimed
in
with
the
stuttering
of
the
machine
guns
little
white
clouds
sailed
above
him
in
a
blue
sky
and
in
front
of
him
was
a
group
of
houses
that
had
the
same
color
white
with
shadows
as
the
clouds
he
was
in
a
house
with
a
grenade
like
a
tin
pineapple
in
each
hand
the
sudden
loneliness
frightened
him
again
outside
the
house
was
a
sound
of
firing
broken
by
the
occasional
bursting
of
a
shell
he
looked
at
the
roof
and
at
a
chromo
of
a
woman
nursing
a
child
that
hung
on
the
whitewashed
wall
opposite
him
he
was
in
a
small
kitchen
there
was
a
fire
in
the
hearth
where
something
boiled
in
a
black
pot
chrisfield
tiptoed
over
and
looked
in
at
the
bottom
of
the
bubbling
water
he
saw
five
potatoes
at
the
other
end
of
the
kitchen
beyond
two
broken
chairs
was
a
door
chrisfield
crept
over
to
it
the
tiles
seeming
to
sway
under
foot
he
put
his
finger
to
the
latch
and
took
it
off
again
suddenly
holding
in
his
breath
he
stood
a
long
time
looking
at
the
door
then
he
pulled
it
open
recklessly
a
young
man
with
fair
hair
was
sitting
at
a
table
his
head
resting
on
his
hands
chrisfield
felt
a
spurt
of
joy
when
he
saw
that
the
man
uniform
was
green
very
coolly
he
pressed
the
spring
held
the
grenade
a
second
and
then
threw
it
throwing
himself
backwards
into
the
middle
of
the
kitchen
the
man
had
not
moved
his
blue
eyes
still
stared
straight
before
him
in
the
street
chrisfield
ran
into
a
tall
man
who
was
running
the
man
clutched
him
by
the
arm
and
said
the
barrage
is
moving
what
barrage
our
barrage
we
got
to
run
we
ahead
of
his
voice
came
in
wheezy
pants
there
were
red
splotches
on
his
face
they
ran
together
down
the
empty
village
street
as
they
ran
they
passed
the
little
lieutenant
who
leaned
against
a
whitewashed
wall
his
legs
a
mass
of
blood
and
torn
cloth
he
was
shouting
in
a
shrill
delirious
voice
that
followed
them
out
along
the
open
road
where
the
artillery
that
what
i
want
to
know
where
the
artillery
the
woods
were
grey
and
dripping
with
dawn
chrisfield
got
stiffly
to
his
feet
from
the
pile
of
leaves
where
he
had
slept
he
felt
numb
with
cold
and
hunger
lonely
and
lost
away
from
his
outfit
all
about
him
were
men
of
another
division
a
captain
with
a
sandy
mustache
was
striding
up
and
down
with
a
blanket
about
him
on
the
road
just
behind
a
clump
of
beech
trees
chrisfield
had
watched
him
passing
back
and
forth
back
and
forth
behind
the
wet
clustered
trunks
of
the
trees
ever
since
it
had
been
light
stamping
his
feet
among
the
damp
leaves
chrisfield
strolled
away
from
the
group
of
men
no
one
seemed
to
notice
him
the
trees
closed
about
him
he
could
see
nothing
but
moist
trees
and
black
and
the
yellow
leaves
of
saplings
that
cut
off
the
view
in
every
direction
he
was
wondering
dully
why
he
was
walking
off
that
way
somewhere
in
the
back
of
his
mind
there
was
a
vague
idea
of
finding
his
outfit
sergeant
higgins
and
andy
and
judkins
and
small
he
wondered
what
had
become
of
them
he
thought
of
the
company
lined
up
for
mess
and
the
smell
of
greasy
food
that
came
from
the
he
was
desperately
hungry
he
stopped
and
leaned
against
the
trunk
of
a
tree
the
deep
scratch
in
his
leg
was
throbbing
as
if
all
the
blood
in
his
body
beat
through
it
now
that
his
rustling
footsteps
had
ceased
the
woods
were
absolutely
silent
except
for
the
dripping
of
dew
from
the
leaves
and
branches
he
strained
his
ears
to
hear
some
other
sound
then
he
noticed
that
he
was
staring
at
a
tree
full
of
small
red
crab
apples
he
picked
a
handful
greedily
but
they
were
hard
and
sour
and
seemed
to
make
him
hungrier
the
sour
flavour
in
his
mouth
made
him
furiously
angry
he
kicked
at
the
thin
trunk
of
the
tree
while
tears
smarted
in
his
eyes
swearing
aloud
in
a
whining
singsong
voice
he
strode
off
through
the
woods
with
his
eyes
on
the
ground
twigs
snapped
viciously
in
his
face
crooked
branches
caught
at
him
but
he
plunged
on
all
at
once
he
stumbled
against
something
hard
that
bounced
among
the
leaves
he
stopped
still
looking
about
him
terrified
two
grenades
lay
just
under
his
foot
a
little
further
on
a
man
was
propped
against
a
tree
with
his
mouth
open
chrisfield
thought
at
first
he
was
asleep
as
his
eyes
were
closed
he
looked
at
the
grenades
carefully
the
fuses
had
not
been
sprung
he
put
one
in
each
pocket
gave
a
glance
at
the
man
who
seemed
to
be
asleep
and
strode
off
again
striking
another
alley
in
the
woods
at
the
end
of
which
he
could
see
sunlight
the
sky
overhead
was
full
of
heavy
purple
clouds
tinged
here
and
there
with
yellow
as
he
walked
towards
the
patch
of
sunlight
the
thought
came
to
him
that
he
ought
to
have
looked
in
the
pockets
of
the
man
he
had
just
passed
to
see
if
he
had
any
hard
bread
he
stood
still
a
moment
in
hesitation
but
started
walking
again
doggedly
towards
the
patch
of
sunlight
something
glittered
in
the
irregular
fringe
of
sun
and
shadow
a
man
was
sitting
hunched
up
on
the
ground
with
his
fatigue
cap
pulled
over
his
eyes
so
that
the
little
gold
bar
just
caught
the
horizontal
sunlight
chrisfield
first
thought
was
that
he
might
have
food
on
him
say
lootenant
he
shouted
know
where
a
fellow
can
get
somethin
to
the
man
lifted
his
head
slowly
chrisfield
turned
cold
all
over
when
he
saw
the
white
heavy
face
of
anderson
an
unshaven
beard
was
very
black
on
his
square
chin
there
was
a
long
scratch
clotted
with
dried
blood
from
the
heavy
eyebrow
across
the
left
cheek
to
the
corner
of
the
mouth
give
me
some
water
buddy
said
anderson
in
a
weak
voice
chrisfield
handed
him
his
canteen
roughly
in
silence
he
noticed
that
anderson
arm
was
in
a
sling
and
that
he
drank
greedily
spilling
the
water
over
his
chin
and
his
wounded
arm
where
colonel
evans
asked
anderson
in
a
thin
petulant
voice
chrisfield
did
not
reply
but
stared
at
him
sullenly
the
canteen
had
dropped
from
his
hand
and
lay
on
the
ground
in
front
of
him
the
water
gleamed
in
the
sunlight
as
it
ran
out
among
the
russet
leaves
a
wind
had
come
up
making
the
woods
resound
a
shower
of
yellow
leaves
dropped
about
them
first
you
was
a
corporal
then
you
was
a
sergeant
and
now
you
a
lootenant
said
chrisfield
slowly
better
tell
me
where
colonel
evans
is
you
must
know
up
that
road
somewhere
said
anderson
struggling
to
get
to
his
feet
chrisfield
walked
away
without
answering
a
cold
hand
was
round
the
grenade
in
his
pocket
he
walked
away
slowly
looking
at
his
feet
suddenly
he
found
he
had
pressed
the
spring
of
the
grenade
he
struggled
to
pull
it
out
of
his
pocket
it
stuck
in
the
narrow
pocket
his
arm
and
his
cold
fingers
that
clutched
the
grenade
seemed
paralyzed
then
a
warm
joy
went
through
him
he
had
thrown
it
anderson
was
standing
up
swaying
backwards
and
forwards
the
explosion
made
the
woods
quake
a
thick
rain
of
yellow
leaves
came
down
anderson
was
flat
on
the
ground
he
was
so
flat
he
seemed
to
have
sunk
into
the
ground
chrisfield
pressed
the
spring
of
the
other
grenade
and
threw
it
with
his
eyes
closed
it
burst
among
the
thick
leaves
a
few
drops
of
rain
were
falling
chrisfield
kept
on
along
the
lane
walking
fast
feeling
full
of
warmth
and
strength
the
rain
beat
hard
and
cold
against
his
back
he
walked
with
his
eyes
to
the
ground
a
voice
in
a
strange
language
stopped
him
a
ragged
man
in
green
with
a
beard
that
was
clotted
with
mud
stood
in
front
of
him
with
his
hands
up
chrisfield
burst
out
laughing
come
along
he
said
quick
the
man
shambled
in
front
of
him
he
was
trembling
so
hard
he
nearly
fell
with
each
step
chrisfield
kicked
him
the
man
shambled
on
without
turning
round
chrisfield
kicked
him
again
feeling
the
point
of
the
man
spine
and
the
soft
flesh
of
his
rump
against
his
toes
with
each
kick
laughing
so
hard
all
the
while
that
he
could
hardly
see
where
he
was
going
halt
came
a
voice
ah

a
prisoner
shouted
chrisfield
still
laughing
he
ai
much
of

said
the
man
pointing
his

german

pointed
up
the
road
gawd
ah
doan
know
ah
ai
had
nothin
to
eat
fur
a
day
and
a
the
warm
smell
of
a
stew
rose
to
his
nostrils
from
the
chrisfield
stood
feeling
warm
and
important
filling
his
mouth
with
soft
greasy
potatoes
and
gravy
while
men
about
him
asked
him
questions
gradually
he
began
to
feel
full
and
content
and
a
desire
to
sleep
came
over
him
but
he
was
given
a
gun
and
had
to
start
advancing
again
with
the
reconnoitering
squad
the
squad
went
cautiously
up
the
same
lane
through
the
woods
here
an
officer
done
for
said
the
captain
who
walked
ahead
he
made
a
little
clucking
noise
of
distress
with
his
tongue
two
of
you
fellows
go
back
and
git
a
blanket
and
take
him
back
to
the
poor
the
captain
walked
on
again
still
making
little
clucking
noises
with
his
tongue
chrisfield
looked
straight
ahead
of
him
he
did
not
feel
lonely
any
more
now
that
he
was
marching
in
ranks
again
his
feet
beat
the
ground
in
time
with
the
other
feet
he
would
not
have
to
think
whether
to
go
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
he
would
do
as
the
others
did
part
four
rust
i
there
were
tiny
green
frogs
in
one
of
the
puddles
by
the
roadside
john
andrews
fell
out
of
the
slowly
advancing
column
a
moment
to
look
at
them
the
frogs
triangular
heads
stuck
out
of
the
water
in
the
middle
of
the
puddle
he
leaned
over
his
hands
on
his
knees
easing
the
weight
of
the
equipment
on
his
back
that
way
he
could
see
their
tiny
jewelled
eyes
his
eyes
felt
as
if
tears
were
coming
to
them
with
tenderness
towards
the
minute
lithe
bodies
of
the
frogs
something
was
telling
him
that
he
must
run
forward
and
fall
into
line
again
that
he
must
shamble
on
through
the
mud
but
he
remained
staring
at
the
puddle
watching
the
frogs
then
he
noticed
his
reflection
in
the
puddle
he
looked
at
it
curiously
he
could
barely
see
the
outlines
of
a
stained
grimacing
mask
and
the
silhouette
of
the
gun
barrel
slanting
behind
it
so
this
was
what
they
had
made
of
him
he
fixed
his
eyes
again
on
the
frogs
that
swam
with
elastic
leisurely
leg
strokes
in
the
water
absently
as
if
he
had
no
connection
with
all
that
went
on
about
him
he
heard
the
twang
of
bursting
shrapnel
down
the
road
he
had
straightened
himself
wearily
and
taken
a
step
forward
when
he
found
himself
sinking
into
the
puddle
a
feeling
of
relief
came
over
him
his
legs
sunk
in
the
puddle
he
lay
without
moving
against
the
muddy
bank
the
frogs
had
gone
but
from
somewhere
a
little
stream
of
red
was
creeping
out
slowly
into
the
water
he
watched
the
irregular
files
of
men
in
shambling
by
their
footsteps
drummed
in
his
ears
he
felt
triumphantly
separated
from
them
as
if
he
were
in
a
window
somewhere
watching
soldiers
pass
or
in
a
box
of
a
theater
watching
some
dreary
monotonous
play
he
drew
farther
and
farther
away
from
them
until
they
had
become
very
small
like
toy
soldiers
forgotten
among
the
dust
in
a
garret
the
light
was
so
dim
he
could
see
he
could
only
hear
their
feet
tramping
interminably
through
the
mud
john
andrews
was
on
a
ladder
that
shook
horribly
a
gritty
sponge
in
his
hand
he
was
washing
the
windows
of
a
barracks
he
began
in
the
left
hand
corner
and
soaped
the
small
oblong
panes
one
after
the
other
his
arms
were
like
lead
and
he
felt
that
he
would
fall
from
the
shaking
ladder
but
each
time
he
turned
to
look
towards
the
ground
before
climbing
down
he
saw
the
top
of
the
general
cap
and
the
chin
protruding
from
under
the
visor
and
a
voice
snarled
attention
terrifying
him
so
that
the
ladder
shook
more
than
ever
and
he
went
on
smearing
soap
over
the
oblong
panes
with
the
gritty
sponge
through
interminable
hours
though
every
joint
in
his
body
was
racked
by
the
shaking
of
the
ladder
bright
light
flared
from
inside
the
windows
which
he
soaped
pane
after
pane
methodically
the
windows
were
mirrors
in
each
pane
he
saw
his
thin
face
in
shadow
with
the
shadow
of
a
gun
barrel
slanting
beside
it
the
jolting
stopped
suddenly
he
sank
into
a
deep
pit
of
blackness
a
shrill
broken
voice
was
singing
in
his
ear
there
a
girl
in
the
heart
of
maryland
with
a
heart
that
belongs
to
john
andrews
opened
his
eyes
it
was
pitch
black
except
for
a
series
of
bright
yellow
oblongs
that
seemed
to
go
up
into
the
sky
where
he
could
see
the
stars
his
mind
became
suddenly
acutely
conscious
he
began
taking
account
of
himself
in
a
hurried
frightened
way
he
craned
his
neck
a
little
in
the
darkness
he
could
make
out
the
form
of
a
man
stretched
out
flat
beside
him
who
kept
moving
his
head
strangely
from
side
to
side
singing
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
in
a
shrill
broken
voice
at
that
moment
andrews
noticed
that
the
smell
of
carbolic
was
overpoweringly
strong
that
it
dominated
all
the
familiar
smells
of
blood
and
sweaty
clothes
he
wriggled
his
shoulders
so
that
he
could
feel
the
two
poles
of
the
stretcher
then
he
fixed
his
eyes
again
in
the
three
bright
yellow
oblongs
one
above
the
other
that
rose
into
the
darkness
of
course
they
were
windows
he
was
near
a
house
he
moved
his
arms
a
little
they
felt
like
lead
but
unhurt
then
he
realized
that
his
legs
were
on
fire
he
tried
to
move
them
everything
went
black
again
in
a
sudden
agony
of
pain
the
voice
was
still
shrieking
in
his
ears
there
a
girl
in
the
heart
of
maryland
with
a
heart
that
belongs
to
but
another
voice
could
be
heard
softer
talking
endlessly
in
tender
clear
tones
an
he
said
they
were
goin
to
take
me
way
down
south
where
there
was
a
little
house
on
the
beach
all
so
warm
an
quiet
the
song
of
the
man
beside
him
rose
to
a
tuneless
shriek
like
a
phonograph
running
down
an
was
when
she
said
that
mine
she
be
another
voice
broke
in
suddenly
in
short
spurts
of
whining
groans
that
formed
themselves
into
fragments
of
intricate
swearing
and
all
the
while
the
soft
voice
went
on
andrews
strained
his
ears
to
hear
it
it
soothed
his
pain
as
if
some
cool
fragrant
oil
were
being
poured
over
his
body
an
there
be
a
garden
full
of
flowers
roses
an
hollyhocks
way
down
there
in
the
south
an
it
be
so
warm
an
quiet
an
the
shine
all
day
and
the
sky
be
so
blue
andrews
felt
his
lips
repeating
the
words
like
lips
following
a
prayer
an
it
be
so
warm
an
quiet
without
any
noise
at
all
an
the
garden
be
full
of
roses
an
but
the
other
voices
kept
breaking
in
drowning
out
the
soft
voice
with
groans
and
strings
of
whining
oaths
an
he
said
i
could
sit
on
the
porch
an
the
sun
be
so
warm
quiet
an
the
garden
smell
so
good
an
the
beach
be
all
white
an
the
sea
andrews
felt
his
head
suddenly
rise
in
the
air
and
then
his
feet
he
swung
out
of
the
darkness
into
a
brilliant
white
corridor
his
legs
throbbed
with
flaming
agony
the
face
of
a
man
with
a
cigarette
in
his
mouth
peered
close
to
his
a
hand
fumbled
at
his
throat
where
the
tag
was
and
someone
read
andrews
but
he
was
listening
to
the
voice
out
in
the
dark
behind
him
that
shrieked
in
rasping
tones
of
delirium
there
a
girl
in
the
heart
of
with
a
heart
that
belongs
to
then
he
discovered
that
he
was
groaning
his
mind
became
entirely
taken
up
in
the
curious
rhythm
of
his
groans
the
only
parts
of
his
body
that
existed
were
his
legs
and
something
in
his
throat
that
groaned
and
groaned
it
was
absorbing
white
figures
hovered
about
him
he
saw
the
hairy
forearms
of
a
man
in
shirt
sleeves
lights
glared
and
went
out
strange
smells
entered
at
his
nose
and
circulated
through
his
whole
body
but
nothing
could
distract
his
attention
from
the
singsong
of
his
groans
rain
fell
in
his
face
he
moved
his
head
from
side
to
side
suddenly
feeling
conscious
of
himself
his
mouth
was
dry
like
leather
he
put
out
his
tongue
to
try
to
catch
raindrops
in
it
he
was
swung
roughly
about
in
the
stretcher
he
lifted
his
head
cautiously
feeling
a
great
throb
of
delight
that
he
still
could
lift
his
head
keep
yer
head
down
ca
yer
snarled
a
voice
beside
him
he
had
seen
the
back
of
a
man
in
a
gleaming
wet
slicker
at
the
end
of
the
stretcher
be
careful
of
my
leg
ca
yer
he
found
himself
whining
over
and
over
again
then
suddenly
there
was
a
lurch
that
rapped
his
head
against
the
crosspiece
of
the
stretcher
and
he
found
himself
looking
up
at
a
wooden
ceiling
from
which
the
white
paint
had
peeled
in
places
he
smelt
gasoline
and
could
hear
the
throb
of
an
engine
he
began
to
think
back
how
long
was
it
since
he
had
looked
at
the
little
frogs
in
the
puddle
a
vivid
picture
came
to
his
mind
of
the
puddle
with
its
water
and
the
little
triangular
heads
of
the
frogs
but
it
seemed
as
long
ago
as
a
memory
of
childhood
all
of
his
life
before
that
was
not
so
long
as
the
time
that
had
gone
by
since
the
car
had
started
and
he
was
jolting
and
swinging
about
in
the
stretcher
clutching
hard
with
his
hands
at
the
poles
of
the
stretcher
the
pain
in
his
legs
grew
worse
the
rest
of
his
body
seemed
to
shrivel
under
it
from
below
him
came
a
rasping
voice
that
cried
out
at
every
lurch
of
the
ambulance
he
fought
against
the
desire
to
groan
but
at
last
he
gave
in
and
lay
lost
in
the
monotonous
singsong
of
his
groans
the
rain
was
in
his
face
again
for
a
moment
then
his
body
was
tilted
a
row
of
houses
and
russet
trees
and
chimney
pots
against
a
leaden
sky
swung
suddenly
up
into
sight
and
were
instantly
replaced
by
a
ceiling
and
the
coffred
vault
of
a
staircase
andrews
was
still
groaning
softly
but
his
eyes
fastened
with
sudden
interest
on
the
sculptured
rosettes
of
the
coffres
and
the
coats
of
arms
that
made
the
center
of
each
section
of
ceiling
then
he
found
himself
staring
in
the
face
of
the
man
who
was
carrying
the
lower
end
of
the
stretcher
it
was
a
white
face
with
pimples
round
the
mouth
and
watery
blue
eyes
andrews
looked
at
the
eyes
and
tried
to
smile
but
the
man
carrying
the
stretcher
was
not
looking
at
him
then
after
more
endless
hours
of
tossing
about
on
the
stretcher
lost
in
a
groaning
agony
of
pain
hands
laid
hold
of
him
roughly
and
pulled
his
clothes
off
and
lifted
him
on
a
cot
where
he
lay
gasping
breathing
in
the
cool
smell
of
disinfectant
that
hung
about
the
bedclothes
he
heard
voices
over
his
head
is
bad
at
all
this
leg
wound
i
thought
you
said
we
have
to
amputate
well
what
the
matter
with
him
then
maybe
a
cold
sweat
of
terror
took
hold
of
andrews
he
lay
perfectly
still
with
his
eyes
closed
spasm
after
spasm
of
revolt
went
through
him
no
they
had
broken
him
yet
he
still
had
hold
of
his
nerves
he
kept
saying
to
himself
still
he
felt
that
his
hands
clasped
across
his
belly
were
trembling
the
pain
in
his
legs
disappeared
in
the
fright
in
which
he
lay
trying
desperately
to
concentrate
his
mind
on
something
outside
himself
he
tried
to
think
of
a
tune
to
hum
to
himself
but
he
only
heard
again
shrieking
in
his
ears
the
voice
which
it
seemed
to
him
months
and
years
ago
had
sung
there
a
girl
in
the
heart
of
maryland
with
a
heart
that
to
the
voice
shrieking
the
blurred
tune
and
the
pain
in
his
legs
mingled
themselves
strangely
until
they
seemed
one
and
the
pain
seemed
merely
a
throbbing
of
the
maddening
tune
he
opened
his
eyes
darkness
fading
into
a
faint
yellow
glow
hastily
he
took
stock
of
himself
moved
his
head
and
his
arms
he
felt
cool
and
very
weak
and
quiet
he
must
have
slept
a
long
time
he
passed
his
rough
dirty
hand
over
his
face
the
skin
felt
soft
and
cool
he
pressed
his
cheek
on
the
pillow
and
felt
himself
smiling
contentedly
he
did
not
know
why
the
queen
of
sheba
carried
a
parasol
with
little
vermilion
bells
all
round
it
that
gave
out
a
cool
tinkle
as
she
walked
towards
him
she
wore
her
hair
in
a
high
headdress
thickly
powdered
with
blue
iris
powder
and
on
her
long
train
that
a
monkey
held
up
at
the
end
were
embroidered
in
gaudy
colors
the
signs
of
the
zodiac
she
was
not
the
queen
of
sheba
she
was
a
nurse
whose
face
he
could
not
see
in
the
obscurity
and
sticking
an
arm
behind
his
head
in
a
deft
professional
manner
she
gave
him
something
to
drink
from
a
glass
without
looking
at
him
he
said
thank
you
in
his
natural
voice
which
surprised
him
in
the
silence
but
she
went
off
without
replying
and
he
saw
that
it
was
a
trayful
of
glasses
that
had
tinkled
as
she
had
come
towards
him
dark
as
it
was
he
noticed
the
tilt
of
the
nurse
body
as
she
walked
silently
to
the
next
cot
holding
the
tray
of
glasses
in
front
of
her
he
twisted
his
head
round
on
the
pillow
to
watch
how
gingerly
she
put
her
arm
under
the
next
man
head
to
give
him
a
drink
a
virgin
he
said
to
himself
very
much
a
virgin
and
he
found
himself
giggling
softly
notwithstanding
the
twinges
of
pain
from
his
legs
he
felt
suddenly
as
if
his
spirit
had
awakened
from
a
long
torpor
the
spell
of
dejection
that
had
deadened
him
for
months
had
slipped
off
he
was
free
the
thought
came
to
him
gleefully
that
as
long
as
he
stayed
in
that
cot
in
the
hospital
no
one
would
shout
orders
at
him
no
one
would
tell
him
to
clean
his
rifle
there
would
be
no
one
to
salute
he
would
not
have
to
worry
about
making
himself
pleasant
to
the
sergeant
he
would
lie
there
all
day
long
thinking
his
own
thoughts
perhaps
he
was
badly
enough
wounded
to
be
discharged
from
the
army
the
thought
set
his
heart
beating
like
mad
that
meant
that
he
who
had
given
himself
up
for
lost
who
had
let
himself
be
trampled
down
unresistingly
into
the
mud
of
slavery
who
had
looked
for
no
escape
from
the
treadmill
but
death
would
live
he
john
andrews
would
live
and
it
seemed
inconceivable
that
he
had
ever
given
himself
up
that
he
had
ever
let
the
grinding
discipline
have
its
way
with
him
he
saw
himself
vividly
once
more
as
he
had
seen
himself
before
his
life
had
suddenly
blotted
itself
out
before
he
had
become
a
slave
among
slaves
he
renumbered
the
garden
where
in
his
boyhood
he
had
sat
dreaming
through
the
droning
summer
afternoons
under
the
crepe
myrtle
bushes
while
the
cornfields
beyond
rustled
and
shimmered
in
the
heat
he
remembered
the
day
he
had
stood
naked
in
the
middle
of
a
base
room
while
the
recruiting
sergeant
prodded
him
and
measured
him
he
wondered
suddenly
what
the
date
was
could
it
be
that
it
was
only
a
year
ago
yet
in
that
year
all
the
other
years
of
his
life
had
been
blotted
out
but
now
he
would
begin
living
again
he
would
give
up
this
cowardly
cringing
before
external
things
he
would
be
recklessly
himself
the
pain
in
his
legs
was
gradually
localizing
itself
into
the
wounds
for
a
while
he
struggled
against
it
to
go
on
thinking
but
its
constant
throb
kept
impinging
in
his
mind
until
although
he
wanted
desperately
to
comb
through
his
pale
memories
to
remember
if
ever
so
faintly
all
that
had
been
vivid
and
lusty
in
his
life
to
build
himself
a
new
foundation
of
resistance
against
the
world
from
which
he
could
start
afresh
to
live
he
became
again
the
querulous
piece
of
hurt
flesh
the
slave
broken
on
the
treadmill
he
began
to
groan
cold
light
filtered
into
the
ward
drowning
the
yellow
glow
which
first
turned
ruddy
and
then
disappeared
andrews
began
to
make
out
the
row
of
cots
opposite
him
and
the
dark
beams
of
the
ceiling
above
his
head
this
house
must
be
very
old
he
said
to
himself
and
the
thought
vaguely
excited
him
funny
that
the
queen
of
sheba
had
come
to
his
head
it
was
ages
since
he
thought
of
all
that
from
the
girl
at
the
singing
under
her
to
the
patrician
pulling
roses
to
pieces
from
the
height
of
her
litter
all
the
all
the
imaginings
of
your
desire
that
was
the
queen
of
sheba
he
whispered
the
words
aloud
la
reine
de
saba
la
reine
de
saba
and
with
a
tremor
of
anticipation
of
the
sort
he
used
to
feel
when
he
was
a
small
boy
the
night
before
christmas
with
a
sense
of
new
things
in
store
for
him
he
pillowed
his
head
on
his
arm
and
went
quietly
to
sleep
ai
it
juss
like
them
frawgs
te
make
a
place
like
this
into
a
hauspital
said
the
orderly
standing
with
his
feet
wide
apart
and
his
hands
on
his
hips
facing
a
row
of
cots
and
talking
to
anyone
who
felt
well
enough
to
listen
honest
i
doan
see
why
you
fellers
doan
all
cash
in
yer
checks
in
this
hole
there
war
even
electric
light
till
we
put
it
in
what
think
o
that
that
shows
how
much
the
goddam
frawgs
care
the
orderly
was
a
short
man
with
a
sallow
lined
face
and
large
yellow
teeth
when
he
smiled
the
horizontal
lines
in
his
forehead
and
the
lines
that
ran
from
the
sides
of
his
nose
to
the
ends
of
his
mouth
deepened
so
that
his
face
looked
as
if
it
were
made
up
to
play
a
comic
part
in
the
movies
it
kind
of
artistic
though
ai
it
said
applebaum
whose
cot
was
next
andrews
a
skinny
man
with
large
frightened
eyes
and
an
inordinately
red
face
that
looked
as
if
the
skin
had
been
peeled
off
look
at
the
work
there
is
on
that
ceiling
must
have
cost
some
dough
when
it
was
would
be
bad
as
a
dance
hall
with
a
little
fixin
up
but
a
hauspital
hell
andrews
lay
comfortable
in
his
cot
looking
into
the
ward
out
of
another
world
he
felt
no
connection
with
the
talk
about
him
with
the
men
who
lay
silent
or
tossed
about
groaning
in
the
rows
of
narrow
cots
that
filled
the
renaissance
hall
in
the
yellow
glow
of
the
electric
lights
looking
beyond
the
orderly
twisted
face
and
narrow
head
he
could
see
very
faintly
where
the
beams
of
the
ceiling
sprung
from
the
wall
a
row
of
shields
supported
by
figures
carved
out
of
the
grey
stone
of
the
wall
handed
satyrs
with
horns
and
beards
and
eyes
little
squat
figures
of
warriors
and
townsmen
in
square
hats
with
swords
between
their
bent
knees
naked
limbs
twined
in
scrolls
of
spiked
acanthus
leaves
all
seen
very
faintly
so
that
when
the
electric
lights
swung
back
and
forth
in
the
wind
made
by
the
orderly
hurried
passing
they
all
seemed
to
wink
and
wriggle
in
shadowy
mockery
of
the
rows
of
prostrate
bodies
in
the
room
beneath
them
yet
they
were
familiar
friendly
to
andrews
he
kept
feeling
a
desire
to
be
up
there
too
crowded
under
a
beam
grimacing
through
heavy
wreaths
of
pomegranates
and
acanthus
leaves
the
incarnation
of
old
rich
lusts
of
clear
fires
that
had
sunk
to
dust
ages
since
he
felt
at
home
in
that
spacious
hall
built
for
wide
gestures
and
stately
steps
in
which
all
the
little
routine
of
the
army
seemed
unreal
and
the
wounded
men
discarded
automatons
broken
toys
laid
away
in
rows
andrews
was
snatched
out
of
his
thoughts
applebaum
was
speaking
to
him
he
turned
his
head

to

end
of
the
ward
and
disappeared
the
lights
went
out
except
for
the
bulb
over
the
nurse
desk
at
the
end
beside
the
ornate
doorway
with
its
wreathed
pinnacles
carved
out
of
the
grey
stone
which
could
be
seen
above
the
white
canvas
screen
that
hid
the
door
what
that
book
about
buddy
asked
applebaum
twisting
his
head
at
the
end
of
his
lean
neck
so
as
to
look
andrews
full
in
the
face
oh

miss
cavell
a
nurse
just
like

andrews
closed
his
eyes
the
ward
was
quiet
except
for
the
rasping
sound
of
the
snores
and
heavy
breathing
of
the
shattered
men
all
about
him
and
i
thought
she
was
the
queen
of
sheba
he
said
to
himself
making
a
grimace
in
the
dark
then
he
began
to
think
of
the
music
he
had
intended
to
write
about
the
queen
of
sheba
before
he
had
stripped
his
life
off
in
the
bare
room
where
they
had
measured
him
and
made
a
soldier
of
him
standing
in
the
dark
in
the
desert
of
his
despair
he
would
hear
the
sound
of
a
caravan
in
the
distance
tinkle
of
bridles
rasping
of
horns
braying
of
donkeys
and
the
throaty
voices
of
men
singing
the
songs
of
desolate
roads
he
would
look
up
and
before
him
he
would
see
astride
their
foaming
wild
asses
the
three
green
horsemen
motionless
pointing
at
him
with
their
long
forefingers
then
the
music
would
burst
in
a
sudden
hot
whirlwind
about
him
full
of
flutes
and
kettledrums
and
braying
horns
and
whining
bagpipes
and
torches
would
flare
red
and
yellow
making
a
tent
of
light
about
him
on
the
edges
of
which
would
crowd
the
sumpter
mules
and
the
brown
mule
drivers
and
the
gaudily
caparisoned
camels
and
the
elephants
glistening
with
jewelled
harness
naked
slaves
would
bend
their
gleaming
backs
before
him
as
they
laid
out
a
carpet
at
his
feet
and
through
the
flare
of
torchlight
the
queen
of
sheba
would
advance
towards
him
covered
with
emeralds
and
ornaments
with
a
monkey
hopping
behind
holding
up
the
end
of
her
long
train
she
would
put
her
hand
with
its
slim
fantastic
nails
on
his
shoulder
and
looking
into
her
eyes
he
would
suddenly
feel
within
reach
all
the
fiery
imaginings
of
his
desire
oh
if
he
could
only
be
free
to
work
all
the
months
he
had
wasted
in
his
life
seemed
to
be
marching
like
a
procession
of
ghosts
before
his
eyes
and
he
lay
in
his
cot
staring
with
wide
open
eyes
at
the
ceiling
hoping
desperately
that
his
wounds
would
be
long
in
healing
applebaum
sat
on
the
edge
of
his
cot
dressed
in
a
clean
new
uniform
of
which
the
left
sleeve
hung
empty
still
showing
the
creases
in
which
it
had
been
folded
so
you
really
are
going
said
andrews
rolling
his
head
over
on
his
pillow
to

applebaum

andrews
soothingly

of

it
to
the

but
hell
everybody
was
saying
that

fight
to
make
the
world
safe
for
democracy
and
that
if
a
feller
did
go
no
trade
with
him
any
he
started
coughing
suddenly
and
seemed
unable
to
stop
at
last
he
said
weakly
in
a
thin
little
voice
between
coughs
well

well
goin
out
to
see
what
the
mamzelles
look
applebaum
the
uniform
hanging
in
folds
about
his
skinny
body
swaggered
to
the
door
followed
by
the
envious
glances
of
the
whole
ward
gee
guess
he
thinks
he
goin
to
get
to
be
president
said
the
undertaker
bitterly
he
probably
will
said
andrews
he
settled
himself
in
his
bed
again
sinking
back
into
the
dull
contemplation
of
the
teasing
smarting
pain
where
the
torn
ligaments
of
his
thighs
were
slowly
knitting
themselves
together
he
tried
desperately
to
forget
the
pain
there
was
so
much
he
wanted
to
think
out
if
he
could
only
lie
perfectly
quiet
and
piece
together
the
frayed
ends
of
thoughts
that
kept
flickering
to
the
surface
of
his
mind
he
counted
up
the
days
he
had
been
in
the
hospital
fifteen
could
it
be
that
long
and
he
had
not
thought
of
anything
yet
soon
as
applebaum
said
they
be
putting
him
in
class
a
and
sending
him
back
to
the
treadmill
and
he
would
not
have
reconquered
his
courage
his
dominion
over
himself
what
a
coward
he
had
been
anyway
to
submit
the
man
beside
him
kept
coughing
andrews
stared
for
a
moment
at
the
silhouette
of
the
yellow
face
on
the
pillow
with
its
pointed
nose
and
small
greedy
eyes
he
thought
of
the
swell
undertaking
establishment
of
the
black
gloves
and
long
faces
and
soft
tactful
voices
that
man
and
his
father
before
him
lived
by
pretending
things
they
did
feel
by
swathing
reality
with
all
manner
of
crepe
and
trumpery
for
those
people
no
one
ever
died
they
passed
away
they
deceased
still
there
had
to
be
undertakers
there
was
no
more
stain
about
that
than
about
any
other
trade
and
it
was
so
as
not
to
spoil
his
trade
that
the
undertaker
had
enlisted
and
to
make
the
world
safe
for
democracy
too
the
phrase
came
to
andrews
mind
amid
an
avalanche
of
popular
tunes
of
visions
of
patriotic
numbers
on
the
vaudeville
stage
he
remembered
the
great
flags
waving
triumphantly
over
fifth
avenue
and
the
crowds
dutifully
cheering
but
those
were
valid
reasons
for
the
undertaker
but
for
him
john
andrews
were
they
valid
reasons
no
he
had
no
trade
he
had
not
been
driven
into
the
army
by
the
force
of
public
opinion
he
had
not
been
carried
away
by
any
wave
of
blind
confidence
in
the
phrases
of
bought
propagandists
he
had
not
had
the
strength
to
live
the
thought
came
to
him
of
all
those
who
down
the
long
tragedy
of
history
had
given
themselves
smilingly
for
the
integrity
of
their
thoughts
he
had
not
had
the
courage
to
move
a
muscle
for
his
freedom
but
he
had
been
fairly
cheerful
about
risking
his
life
as
a
soldier
in
a
cause
he
believed
useless
what
right
had
a
man
to
exist
who
was
too
cowardly
to
stand
up
for
what
he
thought
and
felt
for
his
whole
makeup
for
everything
that
made
him
an
individual
apart
from
his
fellows
and
not
a
slave
to
stand
cap
in
hand
waiting
for
someone
of
stronger
will
to
tell
him
to
act
like
a
sudden
nausea
disgust
surged
up
in
him
his
mind
ceased
formulating
phrases
and
thoughts
he
gave
himself
over
to
disgust
as
a
man
who
has
drunk
a
great
deal
holding
on
tight
to
the
reins
of
his
will
suddenly
gives
himself
over
pellmell
to
drunkenness
he
lay
very
still
with
his
eyes
closed
listening
to
the
stir
of
the
ward
the
voices
of
men
talking
and
the
fits
of
coughing
that
shook
the
man
next
him
the
smarting
pain
throbbed
monotonously
he
felt
hungry
and
wondered
vaguely
if
it
were
supper
time
how
little
they
gave
you
to
eat
in
the
hospital
he
called
over
to
the
man
in
the
opposite
cot
hay
stalky
what
time
is
it
it
after
messtime
now
got
a
good
appetite
for
the
steak
and
onions
and
french
fried
potatoes
shut
a
rattling
of
tin
dishes
at
the
other
end
of
the
ward
made
andrews
wriggle
up
further
on
his
pillow
verses
from
the
shropshire
lad
jingled
mockingly
through
his
head
the
world
it
was
the
old
world
yet
i
was
i
my
things
were
wet
and
nothing
now
remained
to
do
but
begin
the
game
after
he
had
eaten
he
picked
up
the
tentation
de
saint
antoine
that
lay
on
the
cot
beside
his
immovable
legs
and
buried
himself
in
it
reading
the
gorgeously
modulated
sentences
voraciously
as
if
the
book
were
a
drug
in
which
he
could
drink
deep
forgetfulness
of
himself
he
put
the
book
down
and
closed
his
eyes
his
mind
was
full
of
intangible
floating
glow
like
the
ocean
on
a
warm
night
when
every
wave
breaks
into
pale
flame
and
mysterious
milky
lights
keep
rising
to
the
surface
out
of
the
dark
waters
and
gleaming
and
vanishing
he
became
absorbed
in
the
strange
fluid
harmonies
that
permeated
his
whole
body
as
a
grey
sky
at
nightfall
suddenly
becomes
filled
with
endlessly
changing
patterns
of
light
and
color
and
shadow
when
he
tried
to
seize
hold
of
his
thoughts
to
give
them
definite
musical
expression
in
his
mind
he
found
himself
suddenly
empty
the
way
a
sandy
inlet
on
the
beach
that
has
been
full
of
shoals
of
silver
fishes
becomes
suddenly
empty
when
a
shadow
crosses
the
water
and
the
man
who
is
watching
sees
wanly
his
own
reflection
instead
of
the
flickering
of
thousands
of
tiny
silver
bodies
john
andrews
awoke
to
feel
a
cold
hand
on
his
head
feeling
all
right
said
a
voice
in
his
ear
he
found
himself
looking
in
a
puffy
face
with
a
lean
nose
and
grey
eyes
with
dark
rings
under
them
andrews
felt
the
eyes
looking
him
over
inquisitively
he
saw
the
red
triangle
on
the
man
khaki
sleeve
yes
he
said
if
you
do
mind
i
like
to
talk
to
you
a
little
while
not
a
bit
have
you
got
a
chair
said
andrews
smiling
i
do
suppose
it
was
just
right
of
me
to
wake
you
up
but
you
see
it
was
this
way
you
were
the
next
in
line
an
i
was
afraid
i
forget
you
if
i
skipped
i
understand
said
andrews
with
a
sudden
determination
to
take
the
initiative
away
from
the
y
man
how
long
have
you
been
in
france
like
the
war
he
asked
hurriedly
the
y
man
smiled
sadly
you
seem
pretty
spry
he
said
i
guess
you
in
a
hurry
to
get
back
at
the
front
and
get
some
more
he
smiled
again
with
an
air
of
indulgence
andrews
did
not
answer
no
sonny
i
do
like
it
here
the
y
man
said
after
a
pause
i
wish
i
was
home
but
it
great
to
feel
you
doing
your
it
must
be
said
andrews
have
you
heard
about
the
great
air
raids
our
boys
have
pulled
off
they
bombarded
frankfort
now
if
they
could
only
wipe
berlin
off
the
say
hate
awful
hard
said
andrews
in
a
low
voice
because
if
you
do
i
can
tell
you
something
will
tickle
you
most
to
death
lean
the
y
man
leant
over
curiously
some
german
prisoners
come
to
this
hospital
at
six
every
night
to
get
the
garbage
now
all
you
need
to
do
if
you
really
hate
so
bad
is
borrow
a
revolver
from
one
of
your
officer
friends
and
just
shoot
up
the
convoy
say
where
were
you
raised
boy
the
y
man
sat
up
suddenly
with
a
look
of
alarm
on
his
face
do
you
know
that
prisoners
are
sacred
know
what
our
colonel
told
us
before
going
into
the
argonne
offensive
the
more
prisoners
we
took
the
less
grub
be
and
do
you
know
what
happened
to
the
prisoners
that
were
taken
why
do
you
hate
the
huns
because
they
are
barbarians
enemies
of
civilization
you
must
have
enough
education
to
know
that
said
the
y
man
raising
his
voice
angrily
what
church
do
you
belong
to
but
you
must
have
been
connected
with
some
church
boy
you
have
been
raised
a
heathen
in
america
every
christian
belongs
or
has
belonged
to
some
church
or
other
from
i
make
no
pretensions
to
andrews
closed
his
eyes
and
turned
his
head
away
he
could
feel
the
y
man
hovering
over
him
irresolutely
after
a
while
he
opened
his
eyes
the
y
man
was
leaning
over
the
next
bed
through
the
window
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
ward
he
could
see
a
bit
of
blue
sky
among
white
clouds
with
mauve
shadows
he
stared
at
it
until
the
clouds
beginning
to
grow
golden
into
evening
covered
it
furious
hopeless
irritation
consumed
him
how
these
people
enjoyed
hating
at
that
rate
it
was
better
to
be
at
the
front
men
were
more
humane
when
they
were
killing
each
other
than
when
they
were
talking
about
it
so
was
civilization
nothing
but
a
vast
edifice
of
sham
and
the
war
instead
of
its
crumbling
was
its
fullest
and
most
ultimate
expression
oh
but
there
must
be
something
more
in
the
world
than
greed
and
hatred
and
cruelty
were
they
all
shams
too
these
gigantic
phrases
that
floated
like
gaudy
kites
high
above
mankind
kites
that
was
it
contraptions
of
tissue
paper
held
at
the
end
of
a
string
ornaments
not
to
be
taken
seriously
he
thought
of
all
the
long
procession
of
men
who
had
been
touched
by
the
unutterable
futility
of
the
lives
of
men
who
had
tried
by
phrases
to
make
things
otherwise
who
had
taught
unworldliness
dim
enigmatic
figures
they
were
democritus
socrates
epicurus
christ
so
many
of
them
and
so
vague
in
the
silvery
mist
of
history
that
he
hardly
knew
that
they
were
not
his
own
imagining
lucretius
francis
voltaire
rousseau
and
how
many
others
known
and
unknown
through
the
tragic
centuries
they
had
wept
some
of
them
and
some
of
them
had
laughed
and
their
phrases
had
risen
glittering
soap
bubbles
to
dazzle
men
for
a
moment
and
had
shattered
and
he
felt
a
crazy
desire
to
join
the
forlorn
ones
to
throw
himself
into
inevitable
defeat
to
live
his
life
as
he
saw
it
in
spite
of
everything
to
proclaim
once
more
the
falseness
of
the
gospels
under
the
cover
of
which
greed
and
fear
filled
with
more
and
yet
more
pain
the
already
unbearable
agony
of
human
life
as
soon
as
he
got
out
of
the
hospital
he
would
desert
the
determination
formed
suddenly
in
his
mind
making
the
excited
blood
surge
gloriously
through
his
body
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
he
would
desert
he
pictured
himself
hobbling
away
in
the
dark
on
his
lame
legs
stripping
his
uniform
off
losing
himself
in
some
out
of
the
way
corner
of
france
or
slipping
by
the
sentries
to
spain
and
freedom
he
was
ready
to
endure
anything
to
face
any
sort
of
death
for
the
sake
of
a
few
months
of
liberty
in
which
to
forget
the
degradation
of
this
last
year
this
was
his
last
run
with
the
pack
an
enormous
exhilaration
took
hold
of
him
it
seemed
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
had
ever
determined
to
act
all
the
rest
had
been
aimless
drifting
the
blood
sang
m
his
ears
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
figures
that
supported
the
shields
under
the
beams
in
the
wall
opposite
they
seemed
to
be
wriggling
out
of
their
contorted
positions
and
smiling
encouragement
to
him
he
imagined
them
warriors
out
of
old
tales
on
their
way
to
clay
dragons
in
enchanted
woods
guildsmen
and
artisans
cupids
and
satyrs
and
fauns
jumping
from
their
niches
and
carrying
him
off
with
them
in
a
headlong
rout
to
a
sound
of
flutes
on
a
last
forlorn
assault
on
the
citadels
of
pain
the
lights
went
out
and
an
orderly
came
round
with
chocolate
that
poured
with
a
pleasant
soothing
sound
into
the
tin
cups
with
a
greasiness
of
chocolate
in
his
mouth
and
the
warmth
of
it
in
his
stomach
john
andrews
went
to
sleep
there
was
a
stir
in
the
ward
when
he
woke
up
reddish
sunlight
filtered
in
through
the
window
opposite
and
from
outside
came
a
confused
noise
a
sound
of
bells
ringing
and
whistles
blowing
andrews
looked
past
his
feet
towards
stalky
cot
opposite
stalky
was
sitting
bolt
upright
in
bed
with
his
eyes
round
as
quarters
fellers
the
war
over
put
him
cut
pull
the
tie
that
bull
outside
came
from
every
side
of
the
ward
fellers
shouted
stalky
louder
than
ever
it
straight
dope
the
war
over
i
just
dreamt
the
kaiser
came
up
to
me
on
fourteenth
street
and
bummed
a
nickel
for
a
glass
of
beer
the
war
over
do
you
hear
the
whistles
all
right
let
go
shut
up
ca
you
let
a
feller
sleep
the
ward
quieted
down
again
but
all
eyes
were
wide
open
men
lay
strangely
still
in
their
cots
waiting
wondering
all
i
can
say
shouted
stalky
again
is
that
she
was
some
war
while
she
lasted
what
did
i
tell
yer
as
he
spoke
the
canvas
screen
in
front
of
the
door
collapsed
and
the
major
appeared
with
his
cap
askew
over
his
red
face
and
a
brass
bell
in
his
hand
which
he
rang
frantically
as
he
advanced
into
the
ward
men
he
shouted
in
the
deep
roar
of
one
announcing
baseball
scores
the
war
ended
at
this
morning
the
armistice
is
signed
to
hell
with
the
kaiser
then
he
rang
the
dinner
bell
madly
and
danced
along
the
aisle
between
the
rows
of
cots
holding
the
head
nurse
by
one
hand
who
held
a
little
lieutenant
by
the
other
hand
who
in
turn
held
another
nurse
and
so
on
the
line
advanced
jerkily
into
the
ward
the
front
part
was
singing
the
star
spangled
banner
and
the
rear
the
yanks
are
coming
and
through
it
all
the
major
rang
his
brass
bell
the
men
who
were
well
enough
sat
up
in
bed
and
yelled
the
others
rolled
restlessly
about
sickened
by
the
din
they
made
the
circuit
of
the
ward
and
filed
out
leaving
confusion
behind
them
the
dinner
bell
could
be
heard
faintly
in
the
other
parts
of
the
building
well
what
think
of
it
undertaker
said
andrews
why
the
undertaker
turned
his
small
black
eyes
on
andrews
and
looked
him
straight
in
the
face
you
know
what
the
matter

me

wound
coughing

out
o
here
to
a
ward
the
hell
they
are
andrews
words
were
lost
in
the
paroxysm
of
coughing
that
seized
the
man
next
to
him
home
boys
home
it
home
we
want
to
those
well
enough
were
singing
stalky
conducting
standing
on
the
end
of
his
cot
in
his
pink
red
cross
pajamas
that
were
too
short
and
showed
a
long
expanse
of
skinny
leg
fuzzy
with
red
hairs
he
banged
together
two
bed
pans
to
beat
time
home
i
wo
never
go
home
said
the
undertaker
when
the
noise
had
subsided
a
little
know
what
i
wish
i
wish
the
war
gone
on
and
on
until
everyone
of
them
bastards
had
been
killed
in
which
bastards
the
men
who
got
us
fellers
over
he
began
coughing
again
weakly
but
they
be
safe
if
every
other
human
being
began
andrews
he
was
interrupted
by
a
thundering
voice
from
the
end
of
the
ward
attention
home
boys
home
it
home
we
want
to
went
on
the
song
stalky
glanced
towards
the
end
of
the
ward
and
seeing
it
was
the
major
dropped
the
bed
pans
that
smashed
at
the
foot
of
his
cot
and
got
as
far
as
possible
under
his
blankets
attention
thundered
the
major
again
a
sudden
uncomfortable
silence
fell
upon
the
ward
broken
only
by
the
coughing
of
the
man
next
to
andrews
if
i
hear
any
more
noise
from
this
ward
i
chuck
everyone
of
you
men
out
of
this
hospital
if
you
ca
walk
you
have
to
crawl
the
war
may
be
over
but
you
men
are
in
the
army
and
do
you
forget
the
major
glared
up
and
down
the
lines
of
cots
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
went
out
of
the
door
glancing
angrily
as
he
went
at
the
overturned
screen
the
ward
was
still
outside
whistles
blew
and
churchbells
rang
madly
and
now
and
then
there
was
a
sound
of
singing
ii
the
snow
beat
against
the
windows
and
pattered
on
the
tin
roof
of
the
built
against
the
side
of
the
hospital
that
went
by
the
name
of
sun
parlor
it
was
a
dingy
place
decorated
by
strings
of
dusty
little
paper
flags
that
one
of
the
y
men
had
festooned
about
the
slanting
beams
of
the
ceiling
to
celebrate
christmas
there
were
tables
with
torn
magazines
piled
on
them
and
a
counter
where
cracked
white
cups
were
ranged
waiting
for
one
of
the
rare
occasions
when
cocoa
could
be
bought
in
the
middle
of
the
room
against
the
wall
of
the
main
building
a
stove
was
burning
about
which
sat
several
men
in
hospital
denims
talking
in
drowsy
voices
andrews
watched
them
from
his
seat
by
the
window
looking
at
their
broad
backs
bent
over
towards
the
stove
and
at
the
hands
that
hung
over
their
knees
limp
from
boredom
the
air
was
heavy
with
a
smell
of
coal
gas
mixed
with
carbolic
from
men
clothes
and
stale
cigarette
smoke
behind
the
cups
at
the
counter
a
y
man
a
short
man
with
freckles
read
the
paris
edition
of
the
new
york
herald
andrews
in
his
seat
by
the
window
felt
permeated
by
the
stagnation
about
him
he
had
a
sheaf
of
pencilled
on
his
knees
that
he
rolled
and
unrolled
nervously
staring
at
the
stove
and
the
motionless
backs
of
the
men
about
it
the
stove
roared
a
little
the
y
man
paper
rustled
men
voices
came
now
and
then
in
a
drowsy
whisper
and
outside
the
snow
beat
evenly
and
monotonously
against
the
window
panes
andrews
pictured
himself
vaguely
walking
fast
through
the
streets
with
the
snow
stinging
his
face
and
the
life
of
a
city
swirling
about
him
faces
flushed
by
the
cold
bright
eyes
under
hatbrims
looking
for
a
second
into
his
and
passing
on
slim
forms
of
women
bundled
in
shawls
that
showed
vaguely
the
outline
of
their
breasts
and
hips
he
wondered
if
he
would
ever
be
free
again
to
walk
at
random
through
city
streets
he
stretched
his
legs
out
across
the
floor
in
front
of
him
strange
stiff
tremulous
legs
they
were
but
it
was
not
the
wounds
that
gave
them
their
leaden
weight
it
was
the
stagnation
of
the
life
about
him
that
he
felt
sinking
into
every
crevice
of
his
spirit
so
that
he
could
never
shake
it
off
the
stagnation
of
dusty
ruined
automatons
that
had
lost
all
life
of
their
own
whose
limbs
had
practised
the
drill
manual
so
long
that
they
had
no
movements
of
their
own
left
who
sat
limply
sunk
in
boredom
waiting
for
orders
andrews
was
roused
suddenly
from
his
thoughts
he
had
been
watching
the
snowflakes
in
their
glittering
dance
just
outside
the
window
pane
when
the
sound
of
someone
rubbing
his
hands
very
close
to
him
made
him
look
up
a
little
man
with
chubby
cheeks
and
hair
very
neatly
flattened
against
his
skull
stood
at
the
window
rubbing
his
fat
little
white
hands
together
and
making
a
faint
unctuous
puffing
with
each
breath
andrews
noticed
that
a
white
clerical
collar
enclosed
the
little
man
pink
neck
that
starched
cuffs
peeped
from
under
the
sleeves
of
his
officer
uniform
sam
brown
belt
and
puttees
too
were
highly
polished
on
his
shoulder
was
a
demure
little
silver
cross
andrews
glance
had
reached
the
pink
cheeks
again
when
he
suddenly
found
a
pair
of
steely
eyes
looking
sharply
into
his
you
look
quite
restored
my
friend
said
a
chanting
clerical
voice
i
suppose
i
splendid
splendid
but
do
you
mind
moving
into
the
end
of
the
room
that
he
followed
andrews
saying
in
a
deprecatory
tone
we
going
to
have
just
a
little
bit
of
a
prayer
and
then
i
have
some
interesting
things
to
tell
you
the
y
man
had
left
his
seat
and
stood
in
the
center
of
the
room
his
paper
still
dangling
from
his
hand
saying
in
a
bored
voice
please
fellows
move
down
to
the
end
quiet
please
quiet
the
soldiers
shambled
meekly
to
the
folding
chairs
at
the
end
of
the
room
and
after
some
chattering
were
quiet
a
couple
of
men
left
and
several
tiptoed
in
and
sat
in
the
front
row
andrews
sank
into
a
chair
with
a
despairing
sort
of
resignation
and
burying
his
face
in
his
hands
stared
at
the
floor
between
his
feet
fellers
went
on
the
bored
voice
of
the
y
man
let
me
introduce
the
reverend
skinner
who
the
y
man
voice
suddenly
took
on
deep
patriotic
emotion
who
has
just
come
back
from
the
army
of
occupation
in
at
the
words
army
of
occupation
as
if
a
spring
had
been
touched
everybody
clapped
and
cheered
the
reverend
skinner
looked
about
his
audience
with
smiling
confidence
and
raised
his
hands
for
silence
so
that
the
men
could
see
the
chubby
pink
palms
first
boys
my
dear
friends
let
us
indulge
in
a
few
moments
of
silent
prayer
to
our
great
creator
his
voice
rose
and
fell
in
the
suave
chant
of
one
accustomed
to
going
through
the
episcopal
liturgy
for
the
edification
of
and
congregations
inasmuch
as
he
has
vouchsafed
us
safety
and
a
mitigation
of
our
afflictions
and
let
us
pray
that
in
his
good
time
he
may
see
fit
to
return
us
whole
in
limb
and
pure
in
heart
to
our
families
to
the
wives
mothers
and
to
those
whom
we
will
some
day
honor
with
the
name
of
wife
who
eagerly
await
our
return
and
that
we
may
spend
the
remainder
of
our
lives
in
useful
service
of
the
great
country
for
whose
safety
and
glory
we
have
offered
up
our
youth
a
willing
sacrifice
let
us
pray
silence
fell
dully
on
the
room
andrews
could
hear
the
selfconscious
breathing
of
the
men
about
him
and
the
rustling
of
the
snow
against
the
tin
roof
a
few
feet
scraped
the
voice
began
again
after
a
long
pause
chanting
our
father
which
art
in
heaven
at
the
amen
everyone
lifted
his
head
cheerfully
throats
were
cleared
chairs
scraped
men
settled
themselves
to
listen
now
my
friends
i
am
going
to
give
you
in
a
few
brief
words
a
little
glimpse
into
germany
so
that
you
may
be
able
to
picture
to
yourselves
the
way
your
comrades
of
the
army
of
occupation
manage
to
make
themselves
comfortable
among
the
huns
i
ate
my
christmas
dinner
in
coblenz
what
do
you
think
of
that
never
had
i
thought
that
a
christmas
would
find
me
away
from
my
home
and
loved
ones
but
what
unexpected
things
happen
to
us
in
this
world
christmas
in
coblenz
under
the
american
flag
he
paused
a
moment
to
allow
a
little
scattered
clapping
to
subside
the
turkey
was
fine
too
i
can
tell
you
yes
our
boys
in
germany
are
very
very
comfortable
and
just
waiting
for
the
word
if
necessary
to
continue
their
glorious
advance
to
berlin
for
i
am
sorry
to
say
boys
that
the
germans
have
not
undergone
the
change
of
heart
for
which
we
had
hoped
they
have
indeed
changed
the
name
of
their
institutions
but
their
spirit
they
have
not
changed
how
grave
a
disappointment
it
must
be
to
our
great
president
who
has
exerted
himself
so
to
bring
the
german
people
to
reason
to
make
them
understand
the
horror
that
they
alone
have
brought
deliberately
upon
the
world
alas
far
from
it
indeed
they
have
attempted
with
insidious
propaganda
to
undermine
the
morale
of
our
troops
a
little
storm
of
muttered
epithets
went
through
the
room
the
reverend
skinner
elevated
his
chubby
pink
palms
and
smiled
benignantly
to
undermine
the
morale
of
our
troops
so
that
the
most
stringent
regulations
have
had
to
be
made
by
the
commanding
general
to
prevent
it
indeed
my
friends
i
very
much
fear
that
we
stopped
too
soon
in
our
victorious
advance
that
germany
should
have
been
utterly
crushed
but
all
we
can
do
is
watch
and
wait
and
abide
by
the
decision
of
those
great
men
who
in
a
short
time
will
be
gathered
together
at
the
conference
at
paris
let
me
boys
my
dear
friends
express
the
hope
that
you
may
speedily
be
cured
of
your
wounds
ready
again
to
do
willing
service
in
the
ranks
of
the
glorious
army
that
must
be
vigilant
for
some
time
yet
i
fear
to
defend
as
americans
and
christians
the
civilization
you
have
so
nobly
saved
from
a
ruthless
foe
let
us
all
join
together
in
singing
the
hymn
up
stand
up
for
jesus
which
i
am
sure
you
all
the
men
got
to
their
feet
except
for
a
few
who
had
lost
their
legs
and
sang
the
first
verse
of
the
hymn
unsteadily
the
second
verse
petered
out
altogether
leaving
only
the
y
man
and
the
reverend
skinner
singing
away
at
the
top
of
their
lungs
the
reverend
skinner
pulled
out
his
gold
watch
and
looked
at
it
frowning
oh
my
i
shall
miss
the
train
he
muttered
the
y
man
helped
him
into
his
voluminous
trench
coat
and
they
both
hurried
out
of
the
door
those
are
some
puttees
he
had
on
i
tell
you
said
the
legless
man
who
was
propped
in
a
chair
near
the
stove
andrews
sat
down
beside
him
laughing
he
was
a
man
with
high
cheekbones
and
powerful
jaws
to
whose
face
the
pale
brown
eyes
and
delicately
pencilled
lips
gave
a
look
of
great
gentleness
andrews
did
not
look
at
his
body
somebody
said
he
was
a
red
cross
man
giving
out
cigarettes
fooled
us
that
time
said
andrews
have
a
butt
i
got
one
said
the
legless
man
with
a
large
shrunken
hand
that
was
the
transparent
color
of
alabaster
he
held
out
a
box
of
cigarettes
when
andrews
struck
a
match
he
had
to
lean
over
the
legless
man
to
light
his
cigarette
for
him
he
could
not
help
glancing
down
the
man
tunic
at
the
drab
trousers
that
hung
limply
from
the
chair
a
cold
shudder
went
through
him
he
was
thinking
of
the
zigzag
scars
on
his
own
thighs
did
you
get
it
in
the
legs
too
buddy
asked
the
legless
man
quietly
yes
but
i
had
luck
how
long
have
you
been
here
since
christ
was
a
corporal
oh
i
doan
know
i
been
here
since
two
weeks
after
my
outfit
first
went
into
the
lines

was
on
november

see
much
of
the

three
weeks
once
without

like
that
the
thing
to

you
do
when
you
shake
out
of
your
blankets
is
jump
in
an
have
a
swim
gee

great
to

strikes
the
tops
of
the
birch
trees

a
frying
pan
over
some
sticks
of
pine
and
beech
wood

great
old
smell
is
it
and
after
you
paddled
all
day
an
feel
tired
and
sunburned
right
to
the
palms
of
your
feet
to
sit
around
the
fire
with
some
trout
roastin
in
the
ashes
and
hear
the
sizzlin
the
bacon
makes

arms
wide
god
i

little
parson

said
andrews
suddenly
would
you
the
legless
man
turned
brown
eyes
on
andrews
with
a
smile
i
guess
he
about
as
much
to
blame
as
anybody
is
guys
like
him
i
guess
they
have
that
kind
in
germany
you
do
think
we
made
the
world
quite
as
safe
for
democracy
as
it
might
be
said
andrews
in
a
low
voice
hell
how
should
i
know
i
bet
you
never
drove
an
ice
wagon
i
did
all
one
summer
down
home
it
was
some
life
get
up
at
three
in
the
morning
an
carry
a
hundred
or
two
hundred
pounds
of
ice
into
everybody
ice
box
that
was
the
life
to
make
a
feller
feel
fit
i
was
goin
around
with
a
big
norwegian
named
olaf
who
was
the
strongest
man
i
ever
knew
an
drink
he
was
the
boy
could
drink
i
once
saw
him
put
away
dry
martini
cocktails
an
swim
across
the
lake
on
top
of
it
i
used
to
weigh
a
hundred
and
eighty
pounds
and
he
could
pick
me
up
with
one
hand
and
put
me
across
his
shoulder
that
was
the
life
to
make
a
feller
feel
fit
why
after
bein
out
late
the
night
before
we
jump
up
out
of
bed
at
three
feeling
springy
as
a
what
he
doing
now
asked
andrews
he
died
on
the
transport
coming
here
died
of
the
flu
i
met
a
feller
came
over
in
his
regiment
they
dropped
him
overboard
when
they
were
in
sight
of
the
azores
well
i
did
die
of
the
flu
have
another
butt
no
thanks
said
andrews
they
were
silent
the
fire
roared
in
the
stove
no
one
was
talking
the
men
lolled
in
chairs
somnolently
now
and
then
someone
spat
outside
of
the
window
andrews
could
see
the
soft
white
dancing
of
the
snowflakes
his
limbs
felt
very
heavy
his
mind
was
permeated
with
dusty
stagnation
like
the
stagnation
of
old
garrets
and
lumber
rooms
where
among
superannuated
bits
of
machinery
and
cracked
grimy
crockery
lie
heaps
of
broken
toys
john
andrews
sat
on
a
bench
in
a
square
full
of
linden
trees
with
the
pale
winter
sunshine
full
on
his
face
and
hands
he
had
been
looking
up
through
his
eyelashes
at
the
sun
that
was
the
color
of
honey
and
he
let
his
dazzled
glance
sink
slowly
through
the
black
lacework
of
twigs
down
the
green
trunks
of
the
trees
to
the
bench
opposite
where
sat
two
nursemaids
and
between
them
a
tiny
girl
with
a
face
daintily
colored
and
lifeless
like
a
doll
face
and
a
frilled
dress
under
which
showed
small
ivory
knees
and
legs
encased
in
white
socks
and
yellow
sandals
above
the
yellow
halo
of
her
hair
floated
with
the
sun
shining
through
it
as
through
a
glass
of
claret
a
bright
carmine
balloon
which
the
child
held
by
a
string
andrews
looked
at
her
for
a
long
time
enraptured
by
the
absurd
daintiness
of
the
figure
between
the
big
bundles
of
flesh
of
the
nursemaids
the
thought
came
to
him
suddenly
that
months
had
gone
by
was
it
only
months
since
his
hands
had
touched
anything
soft
since
he
had
seen
any
flowers
the
last
was
a
flower
an
old
woman
had
given
him
in
a
village
in
the
argonne
an
orange
marigold
and
he
remembered
how
soft
the
old
woman
withered
lips
had
been
against
his
cheek
when
she
had
leaned
over
and
kissed
him
his
mind
suddenly
lit
up
as
with
a
strain
of
music
with
a
sense
of
the
sweetness
of
quiet
lives
worn
away
monotonously
in
the
fields
in
the
grey
little
provincial
towns
in
old
kitchens
full
of
fragrance
of
herbs
and
tang
of
smoke
from
the
hearth
where
there
are
pots
on
the
full
of
basil
in
flower
something
made
him
go
up
to
the
little
girl
and
take
her
hand
the
child
looking
up
suddenly
and
seeing
a
lanky
soldier
with
pale
lean
face
and
light
hair
escaping
from
under
a
cap
too
small
for
him
shrieked
and
let
go
the
string
of
the
balloon
which
soared
slowly
into
the
air
trembling
a
little
in
the
faint
cool
wind
that
blew
the
child
wailed
dismally
and
andrews
quailing
under
the
furious
glances
of
the
nursemaids
stood
before
her
flushed
crimson
stammering
apologies
not
knowing
what
to
do
the
white
caps
of
the
nursemaids
bent
over
and
ribbons
fluttered
about
the
child
head
as
they
tried
to
console
her
andrews
walked
away
dejectedly
now
and
then
looking
up
at
the
balloon
which
soared
a
black
speck
against
the
grey
and
clouds
sale
americain
he
heard
one
nursemaid
exclaim
to
the
other
but
this
was
the
first
hour
in
months
he
had
had
free
the
first
moment
of
solitude
he
must
live
soon
he
would
be
sent
back
to
his
division
a
wave
of
desire
for
furious
fleshly
enjoyments
went
through
him
making
him
want
steaming
dishes
of
food
drenched
in
rich
sauces
making
him
want
to
get
drunk
on
strong
wine
to
roll
on
thick
carpets
in
the
arms
of
naked
libidinous
women
he
was
walking
down
the
quiet
grey
street
of
the
provincial
town
with
its
low
houses
with
red
chimney
pots
and
blue
slate
roofs
and
its
irregular
yellowish
cobbles
a
clock
somewhere
was
striking
four
with
deep
booming
strokes
andrews
laughed
he
had
to
be
in
hospital
at
six
already
he
was
tired
his
legs
ached
the
window
of
a
pastry
shop
appeared
invitingly
before
him
denuded
as
it
was
by
wartime
a
sign
in
english
said
walking
in
he
sat
down
in
a
fussy
little
parlor
where
the
tables
had
red
cloths
and
a
print
in
pinkish
and
greenish
colors
hung
in
the
middle
of
the
imitation
brocade
paper
of
each
wall
under
a
print
of
a
poster
bed
with
curtains
in
front
of
which
eighteen
to
twenty
people
bowed
with
the
title
of
secret
sat
three
young
officers
who
cast
cold
irritated
glances
at
this
private
with
a
hospital
badge
on
who
invaded
their
tea
shop
andrews
stared
back
at
them
flaming
with
dull
anger
sipping
the
hot
fragrant
tea
he
sat
with
a
blank
sheet
of
music
paper
before
him
listening
in
spite
of
himself
to
what
the
officers
were
saying
they
were
talking
about
ronsard
it
was
with
irritated
surprise
that
andrews
heard
the
name
what
right
had
they
to
be
talking
about
ronsard
he
knew
more
about
ronsard
than
they
did
furious
conceited
phrases
kept
surging
up
in
his
mind
he
was
as
sensitive
as
humane
as
intelligent
as
as
they
were
what
right
had
they
to
the
cold
suspicious
glance
with
which
they
had
put
him
in
his
place
when
he
had
come
into
the
room
yet
that
had
probably
been
as
unconscious
as
unavoidable
as
was
his
own
biting
envy
the
thought
that
if
one
of
those
men
should
come
over
to
him
he
would
have
to
stand
up
and
salute
and
answer
humbly
not
from
civility
but
from
the
fear
of
being
punished
was
bitter
as
wormwood
filled
him
with
a
childish
desire
to
prove
his
worth
to
them
as
when
older
boys
had
illtreated
him
at
school
and
he
had
prayed
to
have
the
house
burn
down
so
that
he
might
heroically
save
them
all
there
was
a
piano
in
an
inner
room
where
in
the
dark
the
chairs
upside
down
perched
dismally
on
the
table
tops
he
almost
obeyed
an
impulse
to
go
in
there
and
start
playing
by
the
brilliance
of
his
playing
to
force
these
men
who
thought
of
him
as
a
coarse
automaton
something
between
a
man
and
a
dog
to
recognize
him
as
an
equal
a
superior
but
the
war
over
i
want
to
start
living
red
wine
streets
of
the
nightingale
cries
to
the
rose
said
one
of
the
officers
what
do
you
say
we
go
to
paris
well
what
can
they
do
we
are
not
enlisted
men
they
can
only
send
us
home
that
just
what
i
i
tell
you
what
we
go
to
the
cochon
bleu
and
have
a
cocktail
and
think
about
the
lion
and
the
lizard
keep
their
courts
where
what
the
devil
was
his
name
anyway
we
glory
and
drink
deep
while
major
peabody
keeps
his
court
in
dijon
to
his
heart
spurs
jingled
as
the
three
officers
went
out
a
fierce
disgust
took
possession
of
john
andrews
he
was
ashamed
of
his
spiteful
irritation
if
when
he
had
been
playing
the
piano
to
a
roomful
of
friends
in
new
york
a
man
dressed
as
a
laborer
had
shambled
in
would
he
have
felt
a
moment
of
involuntary
scorn
it
was
inevitable
that
the
fortunate
should
hate
the
unfortunate
because
they
feared
them
but
he
was
so
tired
of
all
those
thoughts
drinking
down
the
last
of
his
tea
at
a
gulp
he
went
into
the
shop
to
ask
the
old
woman
with
little
black
whiskers
over
her
bloodless
lips
who
sat
behind
the
white
desk
at
the
end
of
the
counter
if
she
minded
his
playing
the
piano
in
the
deserted
tea
room
among
the
dismal
upturned
chairs
his
crassened
fingers
moved
stiffly
over
the
keys
he
forgot
everything
else
locked
doors
in
his
mind
were
swinging
wide
revealing
forgotten
sumptuous
halls
of
his
imagination
the
queen
of
sheba
grotesque
as
a
satyr
white
and
flaming
with
worlds
of
desire
as
the
great
implacable
aphrodite
stood
with
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
sending
shivers
of
warm
sweetness
rippling
through
his
body
while
her
voice
intoned
in
his
ears
all
the
inexhaustible
voluptuousness
of
life
an
asthmatic
clock
struck
somewhere
in
the
obscurity
of
the
room
seven
john
andrews
paid
said
to
the
old
woman
with
the
mustache
and
hurried
out
into
the
street
like
cinderella
at
the
ball
he
thought
as
he
went
towards
the
hospital
down
faintly
lighted
streets
his
steps
got
slower
and
slower
why
go
back
a
voice
kept
saying
inside
him
anything
is
better
than
better
throw
himself
in
the
river
even
than
go
back
he
could
see
the
clothes
in
a
heap
among
the
dry
bullrushes
on
the
river
bank
he
thought
of
himself
crashing
naked
through
the
film
of
ice
into
water
black
as
chinese
lacquer
and
when
he
climbed
out
numb
and
panting
on
the
other
side
would
he
be
able
to
take
up
life
again
as
if
he
had
just
been
born
how
strong
he
would
be
if
he
could
begin
life
a
second
time
how
madly
how
joyously
he
would
live
now
that
there
was
no
more
war
he
had
reached
the
door
of
the
hospital
furious
shudders
of
disgust
went
through
him
he
was
standing
dumbly
humble
while
a
sergeant
bawled
him
out
for
being
late
andrews
stared
for
a
long
while
at
the
line
of
shields
that
supported
the
dark
ceiling
beams
on
the
wall
opposite
his
cot
the
emblems
had
been
erased
and
the
grey
stone
figures
that
crowded
under
the
shields
the
satyr
with
his
shaggy
goat
legs
the
townsman
with
his
square
hat
the
warrior
with
the
sword
between
his
legs
had
been
clipped
and
scratched
long
ago
in
other
wars
in
the
strong
afternoon
light
they
were
so
dilapidated
he
could
hardly
make
them
out
he
wondered
how
they
had
seemed
so
vivid
to
him
when
he
had
lain
in
his
cot
comforted
by
their
comradeship
while
his
healing
wounds
itched
and
tingled
still
he
glanced
tenderly
at
the
grey
stone
figures
as
he
left
the
ward
downstairs
in
the
office
where
the
atmosphere
was
stuffy
with
a
smell
of
varnish
and
dusty
papers
and
cigarette
smoke
he
waited
a
long
time
shifting
his
weight
restlessly
from
one
foot
to
the
other
what
do
you
want
said
a
sergeant
without
looking
up
from
the
pile
of
papers
on
his
desk
waiting
for
travel
are
you
the
guy
i
told
to
come
back
at
three
it
is
h
the
sergeant
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
papers
which
rustled
as
he
moved
them
from
one
pile
to
another
in
the
end
of
the
room
a
typewriter
clicked
slowly
and
jerkily
andrews
could
see
the
dark
back
of
a
head
between
bored
shoulders
in
a
woolen
shirt
leaning
over
the
machine
beside
the
cylindrical
black
stove
against
the
wall
a
man
with
large
mustaches
and
the
complicated
stripes
of
a
hospital
sergeant
was
reading
a
novel
in
a
red
cover
after
a
long
silence
the
sergeant
looked
up
from
his
papers
and
said
suddenly
the
man
at
the
typewriter
turned
slowly
round
showing
a
large
red
face
and
blue
eyes
he
drawled
go
in
an
see
if
the
loot
has
signed
them
papers
the
man
got
up
stretched
himself
deliberately
and
slouched
out
through
a
door
beside
the
stove
the
sergeant
leaned
back
in
his
swivel
chair
and
lit
a
cigarette
hell
he
said
yawning
the
man
with
the
mustache
beside
the
stove
let
the
book
slip
from
his
knees
to
the
floor
and
yawned
too
this
goddam
armistice
sure
does
take
the
ambition
out
of
a
feller
he
said
hell
of
a
note
said
the
sergeant
know
that
they
had
my
name
in
for
an
hell
of
a
note
goin
home
without
a
sam
the
other
man
came
back
and
sank
down
into
his
chair
in
front
of
the
typewriter
again
the
slow
jerky
clicking
recommenced
andrews
made
a
scraping
noise
with
his
foot
on
the
ground
well
what
about
that
travel
order
said
the
sergeant
loot
out
said
the
other
man
still
typewriting

he
leave
it
on
his
desk
shouted
the
sergeant
angrily

find
i
suppose
i
got
to
go
look
for
it
god
the
sergeant
stamped
out
of
the
room
a
moment
later
he
came
back
with
a
bunch
of
papers
in
his
hand
your
name
jones
he
snapped
to
andrews
snivisky
no
andrews
why
the
hell
could
you
say
so
the
man
with
the
mustaches
beside
the
stove
got
to
his
feet
suddenly
an
alert
smiling
expression
came
over
his
face
good
afternoon
captain
higginsworth
he
said
cheerfully
an
oval
man
with
a
cigar
slanting
out
of
his
broad
mouth
came
into
the
room
when
he
talked
the
cigar
wobbled
in
his
mouth
he
wore
greenish
kid
gloves
very
tight
for
his
large
hands
and
his
puttees
shone
with
a
dark
lustre
like
mahogany
the
sergeant
turned
round
and
goin
to
another
swell
party

asked
the
captain
grinned

an
appreciative
giggle
went
round
will
a
couple
of
packages
do
you
because
i
got
some
here
said
the
sergeant
reaching
in
the
drawer
of
his
desk
the
captain
slipped
them
into
his
pocket
and
swaggered
out
doing
up
the
buttons
of
his
coat
the
sergeant
settled
himself
at
his
desk
again
with
an
important
smile
did
you
find
the
travel
order
asked
andrews
timidly
i
supposed
to
take
the
train
at
ca
make
it
did
you
say
your
name
was
anderson
andrews
john
here
it
is
why
did
you
come
earlier
the
sharp
air
of
the
ruddy
winter
evening
sparkling
in
john
nostrils
vastly
refreshing
after
the
stale
odors
of
the
hospital
gave
him
a
sense
of
liberation
walking
with
rapid
steps
through
the
grey
streets
of
the
town
where
in
windows
lamps
already
glowed
orange
he
kept
telling
himself
that
another
epoch
was
closed
it
was
with
relief
that
he
felt
that
he
would
never
see
the
hospital
again
or
any
of
the
people
in
it
he
thought
of
chrisfield
it
was
weeks
and
weeks
since
chrisfield
had
come
to
his
mind
at
all
now
it
was
with
a
sudden
clench
of
affection
that
the
indiana
boy
face
rose
up
before
him
an
oval
face
with
a
little
of
childish
roundness
about
it
yet
with
black
eyebrows
and
long
black
eyelashes
but
he
did
not
even
know
if
chrisfield
were
still
alive
furious
joy
took
possession
of
him
he
john
andrews
was
alive
what
did
it
matter
if
everyone
he
knew
died
there
were
jollier
companions
than
ever
he
had
known
to
be
found
in
the
world
cleverer
people
to
talk
to
more
vigorous
people
to
learn
from
the
cold
air
circulated
through
his
nose
and
lungs
his
arms
felt
strong
and
supple
he
could
feel
the
muscles
of
his
legs
stretch
and
contract
as
he
walked
while
his
feet
beat
jauntily
on
the
irregular
cobblestones
of
the
street
the
waiting
room
at
the
station
was
cold
and
stuffy
full
of
a
smell
of
breathed
air
and
unclean
uniforms
french
soldiers
wrapped
in
their
long
blue
coats
slept
on
the
benches
or
stood
about
in
groups
eating
bread
and
drinking
from
their
canteens
a
gas
lamp
in
the
center
gave
dingy
light
andrews
settled
himself
in
a
corner
with
despairing
resignation
he
had
five
hours
to
wait
for
a
train
and
already
his
legs
ached
and
he
had
a
side
feeling
of
exhaustion
the
exhilaration
of
leaving
the
hospital
and
walking
free
through
streets
in
the
sparkling
evening
air
gave
way
gradually
to
despair
his
life
would
continue
to
be
this
slavery
of
unclean
bodies
packed
together
in
places
where
the
air
had
been
breathed
over
and
over
cogs
in
the
great
juggernaut
of
armies
what
did
it
matter
if
the
fighting
had
stopped
the
armies
would
go
on
grinding
out
lives
with
lives
crushing
flesh
with
flesh
would
he
ever
again
stand
free
and
solitary
to
live
out
joyous
hours
which
would
make
up
for
all
the
boredom
of
the
treadmill
he
had
no
hope
his
life
would
continue
like
this
dingy
waiting
room
where
men
in
uniform
slept
in
the
fetid
air
until
they
should
be
to
march
or
to
stand
in
motionless
rows
endlessly
futilely
like
toy
soldiers
a
child
has
forgotten
in
an
attic
andrews
got
up
suddenly
and
went
out
on
the
empty
platform
a
cold
wind
blew
somewhere
out
in
the
freight
yards
an
engine
puffed
loudly
and
clouds
of
white
steam
drifted
through
the
faintly
lighted
station
he
was
walking
up
and
down
with
his
chin
sunk
into
his
coat
and
his
hands
in
his
pockets
when
somebody
ran
into
him
damn
said
a
voice
and
the
figure
darted
through
a
grimy
glass
door
that
bore
the
sign
andrews
followed
i
sorry
i
ran
into
you
i
thought
you
were
an
that
why
i
beat
when
he
spoke
the
man
an
american
private
turned
and
looked
searchingly
in
andrews
face
he
had
very
red
cheeks
and
an
impudent
little
brown
mustache
he
spoke
slowly
with
a
faint
bostonian
drawl
that
nothing
said
andrews
let
have
a
drink
said
the
other
man
i

my

with
the

sat
down
at
an
unwashed

soot
from

a
pattern
sticking
to
the
rings
left
by
wine

liqueur
glasses

andrews
with
a
sigh
though
i
shall
never
forget
the
night
with
which
i
realized
i
was
wounded
and
out
of
it
i
thought
i
was
bad
enough
to
be
sent
why
i
would
have
missed
a
minute
of
the
war
but
now
that
over

good
time
in
spite
of

with
he
brought
the
bottle
down
so
hard
on
the
table
that
it
broke
and
the
purple
wine
flowed
over
the
dirty
marble
and
dripped
gleaming
on
the
floor
some
french
soldiers
who
stood
in
a
group
round
the
bar
turned
round
un
gars
qui
gaspille
le
bon
vin
said
a
tall
man
with
long
sloping
whiskers
pour
vingt
sous
la
bouteille
cried
a
little
man
lurching
forward
and
leaning
drunkenly
over
the
table
done
said
henslowe
say
andrews
he
says
he
eat
the
bottle
for
a
he
placed
a
shining
silver
franc
on
the
table
beside
the
remnants
of
the
broken
bottle
the
man
seized
the
neck
of
the
bottle
in
a
black
hand
and
gave
it
a
preparatory
flourish
he
was
a
cadaverous
little
man
incredibly
dirty
with
mustaches
and
beard
of
a
and
a
purple
flush
on
his
cheeks
his
uniform
was
clotted
with
mud
when
the
others
crowded
round
him
and
tried
to
dissuade
him
he
said
fous
mon
metier
and
rolled
his
eyes
so
that
the
whites
flashed
in
the
dim
light
like
the
eyes
of
dead
codfish
why
he
really
going
to
do
it
cried
henslowe
the
man
teeth
flashed
and
crunched
down
on
the
jagged
edge
of
the
glass
there
was
a
terrific
crackling
noise
he
flourished
the
again
my
god
he
eating
it
cried
henslowe
roaring
with
laughter
and
you
afraid
to
go
to
an
engine
rumbled
into
the
station
with
a
great
hiss
of
escaping
steam
gee
that
the
paris
train
tiens
he
pressed
the
franc
into
the
man
hand
come
along
as
they
left
the
buvette
they
heard
again
the
crunching
crackling
noise
as
the
man
bit
another
piece
off
the
bottle
andrews
followed
henslowe
across
the
platform
to
the
door
of
a
carriage
they
climbed
in
henslowe
immediately
pulled
down
the
black
cloth
over
the
half
globe
of
the
light
the
compartment
was
empty
he
threw
himself
down
with
a
sigh
of
comfort
on
the
soft
cushions
of
the
seat
but
what
on
earth
stammered
andrews
fous
mon
metier
interrupted
henslowe
the
train
pulled
out
of
the
station
iii
henslowe
poured
wine
from
a
brown
earthen
crock
into
the
glasses
where
it
shimmered
a
bright
thin
red
the
color
of
currants
andrews
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
looked
through
eyes
at
the
table
with
its
white
cloth
and
little
burnt
umber
loaves
of
bread
and
out
of
the
window
at
the
square
dimly
lit
by
gas
lamps
and
at
the
dark
gables
of
the
little
houses
that
huddled
round
it
at
a
table
against
the
wall
opposite
a
lame
boy
with
white
beardless
face
and
gentle
eyes
sat
very
close
to
the
bareheaded
girl
who
was
with
him
and
who
never
took
her
eyes
off
his
face
leaning
on
his
crutch
all
the
while
a
stove
hummed
faintly
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
from
the
kitchen
door
came
ruddy
light
and
the
sound
of
something
frying
on
the
wall
in
brownish
colors
that
seemed
to
have
taken
warmth
from
all
the
rich
scents
of
food
they
had
absorbed
since
the
day
of
their
painting
were
scenes
of
the
butte
as
it
was
fancied
to
have
once
been
with
windmills
and
wide
fields
i
want
to
travel
henslowe
was
saying
dragging
out
his
words
drowsily
abyssinia
patagonia
turkestan
the
caucasus
anywhere
and
everywhere
what
do
you
say
you
and
i
go
out
to
new
zealand
and
raise
sheep
but
why
not
stay
here
there
ca
be
anywhere
as
wonderful
as
then
i
put
off
starting
for
new
guinea
for
a
week
but
hell
go
crazy
staying
anywhere
after
this
it
got
into
my
blood
all
this
murder
it
made
a
wanderer
of
me
that
what
it
done
i
an
god
i
wish
it
had
made
me
into
anything
so
tie
a
rock
on
to
your
scruples
and
throw
off
the
pont
neuf
and
set
out
o
boy
this
is
the
golden
age
for
living
by
your
you
not
out
of
the
army
i
should
worry
i
join
the
red
how
i
got
a
tip
about
a
girl
with
oval
face
and
faint
black
down
on
her
upper
lip
brought
them
soup
a
thick
greenish
colored
soup
that
steamed
richly
into
their
faces
if
you
tell
me
how
i
can
get
out
of
the
army
you
probably
save
my
life
said
andrews
seriously
there
are
two
ways
oh
but
let
me
tell
you
later
let
talk
about
something
worth
while
so
you
write
music
do
you
andrews
nodded
an
omelet
lay
between
them
pale
with
flecks
of
green
a
few
amber
bubbles
of
burnt
butter
still
clustered
round
the
edges
talk
about
said
henslowe
but
if
you
are
an
adventurer
and
have
no
scruples
how
is
it
you
are
still
a
private
henslowe
took
a
gulp
of
wine
and
laughed
uproariously
that
the
they
ate
in
silence
for
a
little
while
they
could
hear
the
couple
opposite
them
talking
in
low
soft
voices
the
stove
purred
and
from
the
kitchen
came
a
sound
of
something
being
beaten
in
a
bowl
andrews
leaned
back
in
his
chair
this
is
so
wonderfully
quiet
and
mellow
he
said
it
is
so
easy
to
forget
that
there
any
joy
at
all
in
rot
it
a
circus
have
you
ever
seen
anything
drearier
than
a
circus
parade
one
of
those
jokes
that
are
justine
encore
du
vin
called
henslowe
so
you
know
her
name
i
live
here
the
butte
is
the
boss
on
the
middle
of
the
shield
the
axle
of
the
wheel
that
why
it
so
quiet
like
the
centre
of
a
cyclone
of
a
vast
whirling
rotary
circus
parade
justine
with
her
red
hands
that
had
washed
so
many
dishes
off
which
other
people
had
dined
well
put
down
between
them
a
scarlet
langouste
of
which
claws
and
feelers
sprawled
over
the
tablecloth
that
already
had
a
few
purplish
stains
of
wine
the
sauce
was
yellow
and
fluffy
like
the
breast
of
a
canary
bird
know
said
andrews
suddenly
talking
fast
and
excitedly
while
he
brushed
the
straggling
yellow
hair
off
his
forehead
i
almost
be
willing
to
be
shot
at
the
end
of
a
year
if
i
could
live
up
here
all
that
time
with
a
piano
and
a
million
sheets
of
music
paper
it
would
be
worth
but
this
is
a
place
to
come
back
to
imagine
coming
back
here
after
the
highlands
of
thibet
where
you
nearly
got
drowned
and
scalped
and
had
made
love
to
the
daughter
of
an
afghan
chief
who
had
red
lips
smeared
with
loukoumi
so
that
the
sweet
taste
stayed
in
your
henslowe
stroked
softly
his
little
brown
mustache
but
what
the
use
of
just
seeing
and
feeling
things
if
you
express
them
what
the
use
of
living
at
all
for
the
fun
of
it
man
damn
but
the
only
profound
fun
i
ever
have
is
that
andrews
voice
broke
o
god
i
would
give
up
every
joy
in
the
world
if
i
could
turn
out
one
page
that
i
felt
was
adequate
know
it
years
since
i
talked
to
anybody
they
both
stared
silently
out
of
the
window
at
the
fog
that
was
packed
tightly
against
it
like
cotton
wool
only
softer
and
a
color
the
sure
wo
get
us
tonight
said
henslowe
banging
his
fist
jauntily
on
the
table
i
a
great
mind
to
go
to
rue
anne
and
leave
my
card
on
the
provost
marshal
god
damn
remember
that
man
who
took
the
bite
out
of
our
he
did
give
a
hoot
in
hell
did
he
talk
about
expression
why
do
you
express
that
i
think
that
the
turning
point
of
your
career
that
what
made
you
come
to
paris
you
ca
deny
they
both
laughed
loudly
rolling
about
on
their
chairs
andrews
caught
glints
of
contagion
in
the
pale
violet
eyes
of
the
lame
boy
and
in
the
dark
eyes
of
the
girl
let
tell
them
about
it
he
said
still
laughing
with
his
face
bloodless
after
the
months
in
hospital
suddenly
flushed
salut
said
henslowe
turning
round
and
elevating
his
glass
nous
rions
parceque
nous
sommes
gris
de
vin
then
he
told
them
about
the
man
who
ate
glass
he
got
to
his
feet
and
recounted
slowly
in
his
drawling
voice
with
gestures
justine
stood
by
with
a
dish
full
of
stuffed
tomatoes
of
which
the
red
skins
showed
vaguely
through
a
mantle
of
dark
brown
sauce
when
she
smiled
her
cheeks
puffed
out
and
gave
her
face
a
little
of
the
look
of
a
white
cat
and
you
live
here
asked
andrews
after
they
had
all
laughed
always
it
is
not
often
that
i
go
down
to
town
it
so
difficult
i
have
a
withered
he
smiled
brilliantly
like
a
child
telling
about
a
new
toy
and
you
how
could
i
be
anywhere
else
answered
the
girl
it
a
misfortune
but
there
it
she
tapped
with
the
crutch
on
the
floor
making
a
sound
like
someone
walking
with
it
the
boy
laughed
and
tightened
his
arm
round
her
shoulder
i
should
like
to
live
here
said
andrews
simply
why
do
you
but
do
you
see
he
a
soldier
whispered
the
girl
hurriedly
a
frown
wrinkled
the
boy
forehead
well
it
was
by
choice
i
suppose
he
said
andrews
was
silent
unaccountable
shame
took
possession
of
him
before
these
people
who
had
never
been
soldiers
who
would
never
be
soldiers
the
greeks
used
to
say
he
said
bitterly
using
as
phrase
that
had
been
a
long
time
on
his
mind
that
when
a
man
became
a
slave
on
the
first
day
he
lost
of
his
when
a
man
becomes
a
slave
repeated
the
lame
boy
softly
on
the
first
day
he
loses
of
his
what
the
use
of
virtue
it
is
love
you
need
said
the
girl
i
eaten
your
tomato
friend
andrews
said
henslowe
justine
will
get
us
some
he
poured
out
the
last
of
the
wine
that
half
filled
each
of
the
glasses
with
its
thin
sparkle
the
color
of
red
currants
outside
the
fog
had
blotted
everything
out
in
even
darkness
which
grew
vaguely
yellow
and
red
near
the
sparsely
scattered
street
lamps
andrews
and
henslowe
felt
their
way
blindly
down
the
long
gleaming
flights
of
steps
that
led
from
the
quiet
darkness
of
the
butte
towards
the
confused
lights
and
noises
of
more
crowded
streets
the
fog
caught
in
their
throats
and
tingled
in
their
noses
and
brushed
against
their
cheeks
like
moist
hands
why
did
we
go
away
from
that
restaurant
i
like
to
have
talked
to
those
people
some
more
said
andrews
we
have
had
any
coffee
either
but
man
we
in
paris
not
going
to
be
here
long
we
ca
afford
to
stay
all
the
time
in
one
place
it
nearly
closing
time
already
the
boy
was
a
painter
he
said
he
lived
by
making
toys
he
whittles
out
wooden
elephants
and
camels
for
noah
arks
did
you
hear
that
they
were
walking
fast
down
a
straight
sloping
street
below
them
already
appeared
the
golden
glare
of
a
boulevard
andrews
went
on
talking
almost
to
himself
what
a
wonderful
life
that
would
be
to
live
up
here
in
a
small
room
that
would
overlook
the
great
rosy
grey
expanse
of
the
city
to
have
some
absurd
work
like
that
to
live
on
and
to
spend
all
your
spare
time
working
and
going
to
concerts
a
quiet
mellow
existence
think
of
my
life
beside
it
slaving
in
that
iron
metallic
brazen
new
york
to
write
ineptitudes
about
music
in
the
sunday
paper
god
and
they
were
sitting
down
at
a
table
in
a
noisy
cafe
full
of
yellow
light
flashing
in
eyes
and
on
glasses
and
bottles
of
red
lips
crushed
against
the
thin
hard
rims
of
glasses
would
you
like
to
just
rip
it
off
andrews
jerked
at
his
tunic
with
both
hands
where
it
bulged
out
over
his
chest
oh
i
like
to
make
the
buttons
fly
all
over
the
cafe
smashing
the
liqueur
glasses
snapping
in
the
faces
of
all
those
dandified
french
officers
who
look
so
proud
of
themselves
that
they
survived
long
enough
to
be
the
coffee
famous
here
said
henslowe
the
only
place
i
ever
had
it
better
was
at
a
bistro
in
nice
on
this
last
somewhere
else
again
that
it
for
ever
and
ever
somewhere
else
let
have
some
prunelle
before
the
war
the
waiter
was
a
solemn
man
with
a
beard
cut
like
a
prime
minister
he
came
with
the
bottle
held
out
before
him
religiously
lifted
his
lips
pursed
with
an
air
of
intense
application
while
he
poured
the
white
glinting
liquid
into
the
glasses
when
he
had
finished
he
held
the
bottle
upside
down
with
a
tragic
gesture
not
a
drop
came
out
it
is
the
end
of
the
good
old
times
he
said
damnation
to
the
good
old
times
said
henslowe
here
to
the
good
old
new
roughhousy
circus
i
wonder
how
many
people
they
are
good
for
those
circus
parades
of
yours
said
andrews
where
are
you
going
to
spend
the
night
said
henslowe
i
do
know
i
suppose
i
can
find
a
hotel
or
why
do
you
come
with
me
and
see
berthe
she
probably
has
i
want
to
wander
about
alone
not
that
i
scorn
berthe
friends
said
andrews
but
i
am
so
greedy
for
john
andrews
was
walking
alone
down
streets
full
of
drifting
fog
now
and
then
a
taxi
dashed
past
him
and
clattered
off
into
the
obscurity
scattered
groups
of
people
their
footsteps
hollow
in
the
muffling
fog
floated
about
him
he
did
not
care
which
way
he
walked
but
went
on
and
on
crossing
large
crowded
avenues
where
the
lights
embroidered
patterns
of
gold
and
orange
on
the
fog
rolling
in
wide
deserted
squares
diving
into
narrow
streets
where
other
steps
sounded
sharply
for
a
second
now
and
then
and
faded
leaving
nothing
in
his
ears
when
he
stopped
still
to
listen
but
the
city
distant
muffled
breathing
at
last
he
came
out
along
the
river
where
the
fog
was
densest
and
coldest
and
where
he
could
hear
faintly
the
sound
of
water
gurgling
past
the
piers
of
bridges
the
glow
of
the
lights
glared
and
dimmed
glared
and
dimmed
as
he
walked
along
and
sometimes
he
could
make
out
the
bare
branches
of
trees
blurred
across
the
halos
of
the
lamps
the
fog
caressed
him
soothingly
and
shadows
kept
flicking
past
him
giving
him
glimpses
of
smooth
curves
of
cheeks
and
glints
of
eyes
bright
from
the
mist
and
darkness
friendly
familiar
people
seemed
to
fill
the
fog
just
out
of
his
sight
the
muffled
murmur
of
the
city
stirred
him
like
the
sound
of
the
voices
of
friends
from
the
girl
at
the
singing
under
her
to
the
patrician
pulling
roses
to
pieces
from
the
height
of
her
litter
all
the
imagining
of
your
desire
the
murmur
of
life
about
him
kept
forming
itself
into
long
modulated
sentences
in
his
ears
sentences
that
gave
him
by
their
form
a
sense
of
quiet
as
if
he
were
looking
at
a
low
relief
of
people
dancing
carved
out
of
parian
in
some
workshop
in
attica
once
he
stopped
and
leaned
for
a
long
while
against
the
stern
of
a
two
shadows
defined
as
they
strolled
towards
him
into
the
forms
of
a
pale
boy
and
a
bareheaded
girl
walking
tightly
laced
in
each
other
arms
the
boy
limped
a
little
and
his
violet
eyes
were
contracted
to
wistfulness
john
andrews
was
suddenly
filled
with
throbbing
expectation
as
if
those
two
would
come
up
to
him
and
put
their
hands
on
his
arms
and
make
some
revelation
of
vast
import
to
his
life
but
when
they
reached
the
full
glow
of
the
lamp
andrews
saw
that
he
was
mistaken
they
were
not
the
boy
and
girl
he
had
talked
to
on
the
butte
he
walked
off
hurriedly
and
plunged
again
into
tortuous
streets
where
he
strode
over
the
cobblestone
pavements
stopping
now
and
then
to
peer
through
the
window
of
a
shop
at
the
light
in
the
rear
where
a
group
of
people
sat
quietly
about
a
table
under
a
light
or
into
a
bar
where
a
tired
little
boy
with
heavy
eyelids
and
sleeves
rolled
up
from
thin
grey
arms
was
washing
glasses
or
an
old
woman
a
shapeless
bundle
of
black
clothes
was
swabbing
the
floor
from
doorways
he
heard
talking
and
soft
laughs
upper
windows
sent
yellow
rays
of
light
across
the
fog
in
one
doorway
the
vague
light
from
a
lamp
bracketed
in
the
wall
showed
two
figures
pressed
into
one
by
their
close
embrace
as
andrews
walked
past
his
heavy
army
boots
clattering
loud
on
the
wet
pavement
they
lifted
their
heads
slowly
the
boy
had
violet
eyes
and
pale
beardless
cheeks
the
girl
was
bareheaded
and
kept
her
brown
eyes
fixed
on
the
boy
face
andrews
heart
thumped
within
him
at
last
he
had
found
them
he
made
a
step
towards
them
and
then
strode
on
losing
himself
fast
in
the
cool
effacing
fog
again
he
had
been
mistaken
the
fog
swirled
about
him
hiding
wistful
friendly
faces
hands
ready
to
meet
his
hands
eyes
ready
to
take
fire
with
his
glance
lips
cold
with
the
mist
to
be
crushed
under
his
lips
from
the
girl
at
the
singing
under
her
and
he
walked
on
alone
through
the
drifting
fog
iv
andrews
left
the
station
reluctantly
shivering
in
the
raw
grey
mist
under
which
the
houses
of
the
village
street
and
the
rows
of
motor
trucks
and
the
few
figures
of
french
soldiers
swathed
in
long
formless
coats
showed
as
vague
dark
blurs
in
the
confused
dawnlight
his
body
felt
flushed
and
sticky
from
a
night
spent
huddled
in
the
warm
fetid
air
of
an
overcrowded
compartment
he
yawned
and
stretched
himself
and
stood
irresolutely
in
the
middle
of
the
street
with
his
pack
biting
into
his
shoulders
out
of
sight
behind
the
dark
mass
in
which
a
few
ruddy
lights
glowed
of
the
station
buildings
the
engine
whistled
and
the
train
clanked
off
into
the
distance
andrews
listened
to
its
faint
reverberation
through
the
mist
with
a
sick
feeling
of
despair
it
was
the
train
that
had
brought
him
from
paris
back
to
his
division
as
he
stood
shivering
in
the
grey
mist
he
remembered
the
curious
despairing
reluctance
he
used
to
suffer
when
he
went
back
to
boarding
school
after
a
holiday
how
he
used
to
go
from
the
station
to
the
school
by
the
longest
road
possible
taking
frantic
account
of
every
moment
of
liberty
left
him
today
his
feet
had
the
same
leaden
reluctance
as
when
they
used
to
all
but
refuse
to
take
him
up
the
long
sandy
hill
to
the
school
he
wandered
aimlessly
for
a
while
about
the
silent
village
hoping
to
find
a
cafe
where
he
could
sit
for
a
few
minutes
to
take
a
last
look
at
himself
before
plunging
again
into
the
grovelling
promiscuity
of
the
army
not
a
light
showed
all
the
shutters
of
the
shabby
little
brick
and
plaster
houses
were
closed
with
dull
springless
steps
he
walked
down
the
road
they
had
pointed
out
to
him
from
the
o
overhead
the
sky
was
brightening
giving
the
mist
that
clung
to
the
earth
in
every
direction
ruddy
billowing
outlines
the
frozen
road
gave
out
a
faint
hard
resonance
under
his
footsteps
occasionally
the
silhouette
of
a
tree
by
the
roadside
loomed
up
in
the
mist
ahead
its
uppermost
branches
clear
and
ruddy
with
sunlight
andrews
was
telling
himself
that
the
war
was
over
and
that
in
a
few
months
he
would
be
free
in
any
case
what
did
a
few
months
more
or
less
matter
but
the
same
thoughts
were
swept
recklessly
away
in
the
blind
panic
that
was
like
a
stampede
of
wild
steers
within
him
there
was
no
arguing
his
spirit
was
contorted
with
revolt
so
that
his
flesh
twitched
and
dark
splotches
danced
before
his
eyes
he
wondered
vaguely
whether
he
had
gone
mad
enormous
plans
kept
rising
up
out
of
the
tumult
of
his
mind
and
dissolving
suddenly
like
smoke
in
a
high
wind
he
would
run
away
and
if
they
caught
him
kill
himself
he
would
start
a
mutiny
in
his
company
he
would
lash
all
these
men
to
frenzy
by
his
words
so
that
they
too
should
refuse
to
form
into
guns
so
that
they
should
laugh
when
the
officers
got
red
in
the
face
shouting
orders
at
them
so
that
the
whole
division
should
march
off
over
the
frosty
hills
without
arms
without
flags
calling
all
the
men
of
all
the
armies
to
join
them
to
march
on
singing
to
laugh
the
nightmare
out
of
their
blood
would
not
some
lightning
flash
of
vision
sear
people
consciousness
into
life
again
what
was
the
good
of
stopping
the
war
if
the
armies
continued
but
that
was
just
rhetoric
his
mind
was
flooding
itself
with
rhetoric
that
it
might
keep
its
sanity
his
mind
was
squeezing
out
rhetoric
like
a
sponge
that
he
might
not
see
dry
madness
face
to
face
and
all
the
while
his
hard
footsteps
along
the
frozen
road
beat
in
his
ears
bringing
him
nearer
to
the
village
where
the
division
was
quartered
he
was
climbing
a
long
hill
the
mist
thinned
about
him
and
became
brilliant
with
sunlight
then
he
was
walking
in
the
full
sun
over
the
crest
of
a
hill
with
pale
blue
sky
above
his
head
behind
him
and
before
him
were
valleys
and
beyond
other
ranges
of
long
hills
with
patches
of
woodland
glowing
faintly
in
the
sunlight
in
the
valley
at
his
feet
he
could
see
in
the
shadow
of
the
hill
he
stood
on
a
church
tower
and
a
few
roofs
rising
out
of
the
mist
as
out
of
water
among
the
houses
bugles
were
blowing
the
jauntiness
of
the
brassy
notes
ringing
up
through
the
silence
was
agony
to
him
how
long
the
day
would
be
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
seven
thirty
how
did
they
come
to
be
having
mess
so
late
the
mist
seemed
doubly
cold
and
dark
when
he
was
buried
in
it
again
after
his
moment
of
sunlight
the
sweat
was
chilled
on
his
face
and
streaks
of
cold
went
through
his
clothes
soaked
from
the
effort
of
carrying
the
pack
in
the
village
street
andrews
met
a
man
he
did
not
know
and
asked
him
where
the
office
was
the
man
who
was
chewing
something
pointed
silently
to
a
house
with
green
shutters
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
at
a
desk
sat
chrisfield
smoking
a
cigarette
when
he
jumped
up
andrews
noticed
that
he
had
a
corporal
two
stripes
on
his
arm
hello
they
shook
hands
warmly
a
you

andrews
a
sudden
constraint
fell
upon
them
that
good
said
chrisfield
you
a
corporal
now
um
hum
made
me
a
month
they
were
silent
chrisfield
sat
down
in
his
chair
again

of
a
town

a
this
dump

every
day
since
the
goddam
armistice
they
sent
out
a
general
order
telling
to
double
up
on
the
they
heard
a
voice
shouting
orders
outside
and
the
narrow
street
filled
up
suddenly
with
a
sound
of
boots
beating
the
ground
in
unison
andrews
kept
his
back
to
the
window
something
in
his
legs
seemed
to
be
tramping
in
time
with
the
other
legs
there
they
go
said
chrisfield
loot
with
today
want
some
grub
if
it
ai
been
punk
since
the
the
y
hut
was
empty
and
dark
through
the
grimy
windowpanes
could
be
seen
fields
and
a
leaden
sky
full
of
heavy
ocherous
light
in
which
the
leafless
trees
and
the
fields
full
of
stubble
were
different
shades
of
dead
greyish
brown
andrews
sat
at
the
piano
without
playing
he
was
thinking
how
once
he
had
thought
to
express
all
the
cramped
boredom
of
this
life
the
thwarted
limbs
regimented
together
lashed
into
straight
lines
the
monotony
of
servitude
unconsciously
as
he
thought
of
it
the
fingers
of
one
hand
sought
a
chord
which
jangled
in
the
piano
god
how
silly
he
muttered
aloud
pulling
his
hands
away
suddenly
he
began
to
play
snatches
of
things
he
knew
distorting
them
willfully
mutilating
the
rhythm
mixing
into
them
snatches
of
ragtime
the
piano
jangled
under
his
hands
filling
the
empty
hut
with
clamor
he
stopped
suddenly
letting
his
fingers
slide
from
bass
to
treble
and
began
to
play
in
earnest
there
was
a
cough
behind
him
that
had
an
artificial
discreet
ring
to
it
he
went
on
playing
without
turning
round
then
a
voice
said
beautiful
andrews
turned
to
find
himself
staring
into
a
face
of
vaguely
triangular
shape
with
a
wide
forehead
and
prominent
eyelids
over
protruding
brown
eyes
the
man
wore
a
uniform
which
was
very
tight
for
him
so
that
there
were
creases
running
from
each
button
across
the
front
of
his
tunic
oh
do
go
on
playing
it
years
since
i
heard
any
it
was
oh
was
it
anyway
it
was
just
lovely
do
go
on
i
just
stand
here
and
andrews
went
on
playing
for
a
moment
made
a
mistake
started
over
made
the
same
mistake
banged
on
the
keys
with
his
fist
and
turned
round
again
i
ca
play
he
said
peevishly
oh
you
can
my
boy
you
can
where
did
you
learn
i
would
give
a
million
dollars
to
play
like
that
if
i
had
andrews
glared
at
him
silently
you
are
one
of
the
men
just
back
from
hospital
i
yes
worse
oh
i
do
blame
you
these
french
towns
are
the
dullest
places

well

between
you

sit
down
at
that
piano
and
play

spencer
sheffield
shouted
after
him

knock

outside
the
house
where
he
was
quartered
andrews
met
the
new
top

lean
man
with
spectacles
and
a
little
mustache

the
color
and
texture
of
a
scrubbing
brush

top
sergeant
said

a
smile
of
pleasure
in
the
faint
afternoon

remembering
henslowe
constant
drawling
talk
about
distant
places

his
heart
thumping
andrews
ran
after
the
sergeant
passing
in
his
excitement
a
lieutenant
without
saluting
him
look
here
snarled
the
lieutenant
andrews
saluted
and
stood
stiffly
at
attention
why
did
you
salute
me
i
was
in
a
hurry
sir
and
did
see
you
i
was
going
on

urgent

because

of
the

saluted
the
lieutenant
saluted
turned
swiftly
on
his
heel
and
walked
away
andrews
caught
up
to
the
sergeant
sergeant
coffin
can
i
speak
to

a
minute
i
in
a
hell
of
a
have

france

i
well
i
let
you
know
if
i
get
any
general
order
about
it
ca
do
anything
without
getting
a
general
order
about
it
looks
to
me
like
it
all
i
guess
you
the
street
was
grey
dark
stung
by
a
sense
of
impotence
surging
with
despairing
rebelliousness
andrews
hurried
back
towards
the
buildings
where
the
company
was
quartered
he
would
be
late
for
mess
the
grey
street
was
deserted
from
a
window
here
and
there
ruddy
light
streamed
out
to
make
a
glowing
oblong
on
the
wall
of
a
house
opposite
goddam
it
if
ye
do
believe
me
you
go
ask
the
lootenant
look
here
toby
did
our
outfit
see
hotter
work
than
any
goddam
engineers
toby
had
just
stepped
into
the
cafe
a
tall
man
with
a
brown
bulldog
face
and
a
scar
on
his
left
cheek
he
spoke
rarely
and
solemnly
with
a
maine
coast
yankee
twang
i
reckon
so
was
all
he
said
he
sat
down
on
the
bench
beside
the
other
man
who
went
on
bitterly
i
guess
you
would
reckon
so
hell
man
you
ditch
diggers
ai
in
ditch
diggers
the
engineer
banged
his
fist
down
on
the
table
his
lean
pickled
face
was
a
furious
red
i
guess
we
do
dig
half
so
many
ditches
as
the
infantry
does
an
when
we
dug
we
do
crawl
into
an
stay
there
like
goddam
cottontailed
you
guys
do
git
near
enough
to
the
front
like
goddam
cottontailed
jackrabbits
shouted
the
engineer
again
roaring
with
laughter
ai
that
so
he
looked
round
the
room
for
approval
the
benches
at
the
two
long
tables
were
filled
with
infantry
men
who
looked
at
him
angrily
noticing
suddenly
that
he
had
no
support
he
moderated
his
voice
the
infantry
damn
necessary
i
admit
that
but
where
you
fellers
be
without
us
guys
to
string
the
barbed
wire
for
you
there

in
the
oregon
forest
where
we
was
boy
what
d

wire
when

here
i
bet

bottle
of
cognac
my
company

more
losses
than

tek
him
up
joe
said
toby
suddenly
showing
an
interest
in
the
conversation
all
right
it
a
we
had
fifteen
killed
and
twenty
wounded
announced
the
engineer
triumphantly
how
badly
wounded
what

the
cognac
like
hell

had
fifteen

and
twenty
wounded

asked
the
other
man
addressing
the
company
generally

muttered
voices
well
i
guess
it
all
off
then
said
the
engineer

feller
who

the
worst

that
fair
we
had
seven
fellers

said
the
engineer
we

eight
ai
we
sure
growled
everybody
in
the
room
how
bad
was
they
two
of
was
blind
said
toby
hell
said
the
engineer
jumping
to
his
feet
as
if
taking
a
trick
at
poker
we
had
a
guy
who
was
sent
home
without
arms
nor
legs
and
three
fellers
got
from
bein
john
andrews
had
been
sitting
in
a
corner
of
the
room
he
got
up
something
had
made
him
think
of
the
man
he
had
known
in
the
hospital
who
had
said
that
was
the
life
to
make
a
feller
feel
fit
getting
up
at
three
in
the
morning
you
jumped
out
of
bed
just
like
a
cat
he
remembered
how
the
trousers
had
dangled
empty
from
the
man
chair
that
nothing
one
of
our
sergeants
had
to
have
a
new
nose
grafted
on
the
village
street
was
dark
and
deeply
rutted
with
mud
andrews
wandered
up
and
down
aimlessly
there
was
only
one
other
cafe
that
would
be
just
like
this
one
he
could
go
back
to
the
desolate
barn
where
he
slept
it
would
be
too
early
to
go
to
sleep
a
cold
wind
blew
down
the
street
and
the
sky
was
full
of
vague
movement
of
dark
clouds
the
mud
clotted
about
his
feet
as
he
walked
along
he
could
feel
the
water
penetrating
his
shoes
opposite
the
hut
at
the
end
of
the
street
he
stopped
after
a
moment
indecision
he
gave
a
little
laugh
and
walked
round
to
the
back
where
the
door
of
the
y
man
room
was
he
knocked
twice
half
hoping
there
would
be
no
reply
sheffield
whining
voice
said
who
is
it
come
right
in
you
just
the
man
i
wanted
to
andrews
stood
with
his
hand
on
the
knob
do
sit
down
and
make
yourself
right
at
spencer
sheffield
was
sitting
at
a
little
desk
in
a
room
with
walls
of
unplaned
boards
and
one
small
window
behind
the
desk
were
piles
of
cracker
boxes
and
cardboard
cases
of
cigarettes
and
in
the
midst
of
them
a
little
opening
like
that
of
a
railway
ticket
office
in
the
wall
through
which
the
y
man
sold
his
commodities
to
the
long
lines
of
men
who
would
stand
for
hours
waiting
meekly
in
the
room
beyond
andrews
was
looking
round
for
a
chair
oh
i
just
forgot
i
sitting
in
the
only
chair
said
spencer
sheffield
laughing
twisting
his
small
mouth
into
a
shape
like
a
camel
mouth
and
rolling
about
his
large
protruding
eyes
oh
that
all
right
what
i
wanted
to
ask
you
was
do
you
know
anything
about
look
do
come
with
me
to
my
room
interrupted
sheffield
i
got
such
a
nice
with
an
open
fire
just
next
to
lieutenant
bleezer
an
there
we
talk
about
everything
i
just
dying
to
talk
to
somebody
about
the
things
of
the
do
you
know
anything
about
a
scheme
for
sending
enlisted
men
to
french
universities
men
who
have
not
finished
their
oh
would
that
be
just
fine
i
tell
you
boy
there
nothing
like
the
government
to
think
of
things
like
but
have
you
heard
anything
about
it
no
but
i
surely
shall
mind
switching
the
light
off
that
it
now
just
follow
me
oh
i
do
need
a
rest
i
been
working
dreadfully
hard
since
that
knights
of
columbus
man
came
down
here
it
hateful
the
way
they
try
to
run
down
the
now
we
can
have
a
nice
long
talk
you
must
tell
me
all
about
but
do
you
really
know
anything
about
that
university
scheme
they
say
it
begins
february
fifteenth
andrews
said
in
a
low
voice
i
ask
lieutenant
bleezer
if
he
knows
anything
about
it
said
sheffield
soothingly
throwing
an
arm
around
andrews
shoulder
and
pushing
him
in
the
door
ahead
of
him
they
went
through
a
dark
hall
to
a
little
room
where
a
fire
burned
brilliantly
in
the
hearth
lighting
up
with
tongues
of
red
and
yellow
a
square
black
walnut
table
and
two
heavy
armchairs
with
leather
backs
and
bottoms
that
shone
like
lacquer
this
is
wonderful
said
andrews
involuntarily
romantic
i
call
it
makes
you
think
of
dickens
does
it
and
locksley
yes
said
andrews
vaguely
have
you
been
in
france
long
asked
andrews
settling
himself
in
one
of
the
chairs
and
looking
into
the
dancing
flames
of
the
log
fire
will
you
smoke
he
handed
sheffield
a
crumpled
cigarette
no
thanks
i
only
smoke
special
kinds
i
have
a
weak
heart
that
why
i
was
rejected
from
the
army
oh
but
i
think
it
was
superb
of
you
to
join
as
a
private
it
was
my
dream
to
do
that
to
be
one
of
the
nameless
marching
i
think
it
was
damn
foolish
not
to
say
criminal
said
andrews
sullenly
still
staring
into
the
fire
you
ca
mean
that
or
do
you
mean
that
you
think
you
had
abilities
which
would
have
been
worth
more
to
your
country
in
another
position
i
have
many
friends
who
felt
no
i
do
think
it
right
of
a
man
to
go
back
on
himself
i
do
think
butchering
people
ever
does
any
good
i
have
acted
as
if
i
did
think
it
did
good
out
of
carelessness
or
cowardice
one
or
the
other
that
i
think
you
must
talk
that
way
said
sheffield
hurriedly
so
you
are
a
musician
are
you
he
asked
the
question
with
a
jaunty
confidential
air
i
used
to
play
the
piano
a
little
if
that
what
you
mean
said
andrews
music
has
never
been
the
art
i
had
most
interest
in
but
many
things
have
moved
me
intensely
debussy
and
those
beautiful
little
things
of
nevin
you
must
know
them
poetry
has
been
more
my
field
when
i
was
young
younger
than
you
are
quite
a
lad
oh
if
we
could
only
stay
young
i
am
i
do
see
that
youth
by
itself
is
worth
much
it
the
most
superb
medium
there
is
though
for
other
things
said
andrews
well
i
must
go
he
said
if
you
do
hear
anything
about
that
university
scheme
you
will
let
me
know
wo
you
indeed
i
shall
dear
boy
indeed
i
they
shook
hands
in
jerky
dramatic
fashion
and
andrews
stumbled
down
the
dark
hall
to
the
door
when
he
stood
out
in
the
raw
night
air
again
he
drew
a
deep
breath
by
the
light
that
streamed
out
from
a
window
he
looked
at
his
watch
there
was
time
to
go
to
the
regimental
office
before
tattoo
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
village
street
from
the
hut
was
a
house
set
a
little
apart
from
the
rest
in
the
middle
of
a
broad
lawn
which
the
constant
crossing
and
recrossing
of
a
staff
of
cars
and
trains
of
motor
trucks
had
turned
into
a
muddy
morass
in
which
the
wheel
tracks
crisscrossed
in
every
direction
a
narrow
board
walk
led
from
the
main
road
to
the
door
in
the
middle
of
this
walk
andrews
met
a
captain
and
automatically
got
off
into
the
mud
and
saluted
the
regimental
office
was
a
large
room
that
had
once
been
decorated
by
wan
and
mural
paintings
in
the
manner
of
puvis
de
chavannes
but
the
walls
had
been
so
chipped
and
soiled
by
five
years
of
military
occupation
that
they
were
barely
recognisable
only
a
few
bits
of
bare
flesh
and
floating
drapery
showed
here
and
there
above
the
maps
and
notices
that
were
tacked
on
the
walls
at
the
end
of
the
room
a
group
of
nymphs
in
nile
green
and
pastel
blue
could
be
seen
emerging
from
under
a
french
war
loan
poster
the
ceiling
was
adorned
with
an
oval
of
flowers
and
little
plaster
cupids
in
low
relief
which
had
also
suffered
and
in
places
showed
the
laths
the
office
was
nearly
empty
the
littered
desks
and
silent
typewriters
gave
a
strange
air
of
desolation
to
the
gutted
andrews
walked
boldly
to
the
furthest
desk
where
a
little
red
card
leaning
against
the
typewriter
said
regimental
behind
the
desk
crouched
over
a
heap
of
typewritten
reports
sat
a
little
man
with
scanty
sandy
hair
who
screwed
up
his
eyes
and
smiled
when
andrews
approached
the
desk
well
did
you
fix
it
up
for
me
he
asked
fix
what
said
andrews
oh
i
thought
you
were
someone
the
smile
left
the
regimental
thin
lips
what
do
you
want
why
regimental
can
you
tell
me
anything
about
a
scheme
to
send
enlisted
men
to
colleges
over
here
can
you
tell
me
who
to
apply
to
according
to
what
general
orders
and
who
told
you
to
come
and
see
me
about
it
anyway
have
you
heard
anything
about
it
no
nothing
definite
i
busy
now
anyway
ask
one
of
your
own
to
find
out
about
he
crouched
once
more
over
the
papers
andrews
was
walking
towards
the
door
flushing
with
annoyance
when
he
saw
that
the
man
at
the
desk
by
the
window
was
jerking
his
head
in
a
peculiar
manner
just
in
the
direction
of
the
regimental
and
then
towards
the
door
andrews
smiled
at
him
and
nodded
outside
the
door
where
an
orderly
sat
on
a
short
bench
reading
a
torn
saturday
evening
post
andrews
waited
the
hall
was
part
of
what
must
have
been
a
ballroom
for
it
had
a
hardwood
floor
and
big
spaces
of
bare
plaster
framed
by
mouldings
which
had
probably
held
tapestries
the
partition
of
unplaned
boards
that
formed
other
offices
cut
off
the
major
part
of
a
highly
decorated
ceiling
where
cupids
with
bottoms
swam
in
all
attitudes
in
a
sea
of
clouds
wreathing
themselves
coyly
in
heavy
garlands
of
waxy
hothouse
flowers
while
cornucopias
spilling
out
squashy
fruits
gave
andrews
a
feeling
of
distinct
insecurity
as
he
looked
up
from
below
say
are
you
a
kappa
mu
andrews
looked
down
suddenly
and
saw
in
front
of
him
the
man
who
had
signalled
to
him
in
the
regimental
office
are
you
a
kappa
mu
he

the
man
frowned
pulled
his
overseas
cap
down
over
his
forehead
where
the
hair
grew
very
low
and
looked
about
him
mysteriously
yes

said
they
splashed
together
down
the
muddy
village
street
we
got
thirteen
minutes
before

he
spoke
in
a
low
voice
in

staccato
phrases

the
back
room
at

turned
suddenly
to
the
left
up
an
alley
and
broke
through
a
hole
in
a
hawthorn
hedge
a
guy
got
to
keep
his
eyes
and
ears
open
if
he
wants
to
get
anywhere
in
this
army
he
said
as
they
ducked
in
the
back
door
of
a
cottage
andrews
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
billowy
line
of
a
tile
roof
against
the
lighter
darkness
of
the
sky
they
sat
down
on
a
bench
built
into
a
chimney
where
a
few
sticks
made
a
splutter
of
flames
monsieur
desire
a
girl
with
a
baby
in
her
arms

out
of
the
darkness
of
the
room
with
a
candle
and
two
cracked
bowls
from
which
steam
rose
faint
in
the
candle
light
walters
drank
his
bowl

a
gulp

and

headquarters

a
regular
cathedral

a
mason
in
it
but
i
must
beat
it
better
pretend
you
do
know
me
if
you
meet
me
on
the
street
see
all
walters
hurried
out
of
the
door
andrews
sat
alone
looking
at
the
flutter
of
little
flames
about
the
pile
of
sticks
on
the
hearth
while
he
sipped
chocolate
from
the
warm
bowl
held
between
the
palms
of
both
hands
he
remembered
a
speech
out
of
some
very
bad
romantic
play
he
had
heard
when
he
was
very
small
about
your
head
i
fling
the
curse
of
he
started
to
laugh
sliding
back
and
forth
on
the
smooth
bench
which
had
been
polished
by
the
breeches
of
generations
warming
their
feet
at
the
fire
the
woman
stood
with
her
hands
on
her
hips
looking
at
him
in
astonishment
while
he
laughed
and
laughed
mais
quelle
gaite
quelle
gaite
she
kept
saying
the
straw
under
him
rustled
faintly
with
every
sleepy
movement
andrews
made
in
his
blankets
in
a
minute
the
bugle
was
going
to
blow
and
he
was
going
to
jump
out
of
his
blankets
throw
on
his
clothes
and
fall
into
line
for
roll
call
in
the
black
mud
of
the
village
street
it
be
that
only
a
month
had
gone
by
since
he
had
got
back
from
hospital
no
he
had
spent
a
lifetime
in
this
village
being
dragged
out
of
his
warm
blankets
every
morning
by
the
bugle
shivering
as
he
stood
in
line
for
roll
call
shuffling
in
a
line
that
moved
slowly
past
the
cookshack
shuffling
along
in
another
line
to
throw
what
was
left
of
his
food
into
garbage
cans
to
wash
his
mess
kit
in
the
greasy
water
a
hundred
other
men
had
washed
their
mess
kits
in
lining
up
to
drill
to
march
on
along
muddy
roads
splattered
by
the
endless
trains
of
motor
trucks
lining
up
twice
more
for
mess
and
at
last
being
forced
by
another
bugle
into
his
blankets
again
to
sleep
heavily
while
a
smell
hung
in
his
nostrils
of
sweating
woolen
clothing
and
air
and
dusty
blankets
in
a
minute
the
bugle
was
going
to
blow
to
snatch
him
out
of
even
these
miserable
thoughts
and
throw
him
into
an
automaton
under
other
orders
childish
spiteful
desires
surged
into
his
mind
if
the
bugler
would
only
die
he
could
picture
him
a
little
man
with
a
broad
face
and
cheeks
a
small
rusty
mustache
and
lying
like
a
calf
on
a
marble
slab
in
a
butcher
shop
on
top
of
his
blankets
what
nonsense
there
were
other
buglers
he
wondered
how
many
buglers
there
were
in
the
army
he
could
picture
them
all
in
dirty
little
villages
in
stone
barracks
in
towns
in
great
camps
that
served
the
country
for
miles
with
rows
of
black
warehouses
and
narrow
barrack
buildings
standing
with
their
feet
a
little
apart
giving
their
little
brass
bugles
a
preliminary
tap
before
putting
out
their
cheeks
and
blowing
in
them
and
stealing
a
million
and
a
half
or
was
it
two
million
or
three
million
lives
and
throwing
the
warm
sentient
bodies
into
coarse
automatons
who
must
be
kept
busy
lest
they
grow
restive
till
killing
time
began
again
the
bugle
blew
with
the
last
jaunty
notes
a
stir
went
through
the
barn
corporal
chrisfield
stood
on
the
ladder
that
led
up
from
the
yard
his
head
on
a
level
with
the
floor
shouting
shake
it
up
fellers
if
a
guy
late
to
roll
call
it
for
a
as
andrews
while
buttoning
his
tunic
passed
him
on
the
ladder
he
whispered
tell
me
we
going
to
see
service
again
andy
army
o
while
he
stood
stiffly
at
attention
waiting
to
answer
when
the
sergeant
called
his
name
andrews
mind
was
whirling
in
crazy
circles
of
anxiety
what
if
they
should
leave
before
the
general
order
came
on
the
university
plan
the
application
would
certainly
be
lost
in
the
confusion
of
moving
the
division
and
he
would
be
condemned
to
keep
up
this
life
for
more
dreary
weeks
and
months
would
any
years
of
work
and
happiness
in
some
future
existence
make
up
for
the
humiliating
agony
of
this
servitude
dismissed
he
ran
up
the
ladder
to
fetch
his
mess
kit
and
in
a
few
minutes
was
in
line
again
in
the
rutted
village
street
where
the
grey
houses
were
just
forming
outlines
as
light
crept
slowly
into
the
leaden
sky
while
a
faint
odor
of
bacon
and
coffee
came
to
him
making
him
eager
for
food
eager
to
drown
his
thoughts
in
the
heaviness
of
greasy
food
and
in
the
warmth
of
watery
coffee
gulped
down
out
of
a
cup
he
was
telling
himself
desperately
that
he
must
do
something
that
he
must
make
an
effort
to
save
himself
that
he
must
fight
against
the
deadening
routine
that
numbed
him
later
while
he
was
sweeping
the
rough
board
floor
of
the
quarters
the
theme
came
to
him
which
had
come
to
him
long
ago
in
a
former
incarnation
it
seemed
when
he
was
smearing
windows
with
soap
from
a
gritty
sponge
along
the
endless
side
of
the
barracks
in
the
training
camp
time
and
time
again
in
the
past
year
he
had
thought
of
it
and
dreamed
of
weaving
it
into
a
fabric
of
sound
which
would
express
the
trudging
monotony
of
days
bowed
under
the
yoke
under
the
yoke
that
would
be
a
title
for
it
he
imagined
the
sharp
tap
of
the
conductor
baton
the
silence
of
a
crowded
hall
the
first
notes
rasping
bitterly
upon
the
tense
ears
of
men
and
women
but
as
he
tried
to
concentrate
his
mind
on
the
music
other
things
intruded
upon
it
blurred
it
he
kept
feeling
the
rhythm
of
the
queen
of
sheba
slipping
from
the
shoulders
of
her
gaudily
caparisoned
elephant
advancing
towards
him
through
the
torchlight
putting
her
hand
fantastic
with
rings
and
long
gilded
fingernails
upon
his
shoulders
so
that
ripples
of
delight
at
all
the
voluptuous
images
of
his
desire
went
through
his
whole
body
making
it
quiver
like
a
flame
with
yearning
for
unimaginable
things
it
all
muddled
into
fantastic
gibberish
into
sounds
of
horns
and
trombones
and
double
basses
blown
off
key
while
a
piccolo
shrilled
the
first
bars
of
the
star
spangled
he
had
stopped
sweeping
and
looked
about
him
dazedly
he
was
alone
outside
he
heard
a
sharp
voice
call
he
ran
down
the
ladder
and
fell
in
at
the
end
of
the
line
under
the
angry
glare
of
the
lieutenant
small
eyes
which
were
placed
very
close
together
on
either
side
of
a
lean
nose
black
and
hard
like
the
eyes
of
a
crab
the
company
marched
off
through
the
mud
to
the
drill
field
after
retreat
andrews
knocked
at
the
door
at
the
back
of
the
but
as
there
was
no
reply
he
strode
off
with
a
long
determined
stride
to
sheffield
room
in
the
moment
that
elapsed
between
his
knock
and
an
answer
he
could
feel
his
heart
thumping
a
little
sweat
broke
out
on
his
temples
why
what
the
matter
boy
you
look
all
wrought
up
said
sheffield
holding
the
door
half
open
and
blocking
with
his
lean
form
entrance
to
the
room
may
i
come
in
i
want
to
talk
to
you
said
andrews
oh
i
suppose
it
be
all
right
you
see
i
have
an
officer
with
me
then
there
was
a
flutter
in
sheffield
voice
oh
do
come
in
he
went
on
with
sudden
enthusiasm
lieutenant
bleezer
is
fond
of
music
too
lieutenant
this
is
the
boy
i
was
telling
you
about
we
must
get
him
to
play
for
us
if
he
had
the
opportunities
i
am
sure
he
be
a
famous
lieutenant
bleezer
was
a
dark
youth
with
a
hooked
nose
and
pincenez
his
tunic
was
unbuttoned
and
he
held
a
cigar
in
his
hand
he
smiled
in
an
evident
attempt
to
put
this
enlisted
man
at
his
ease
yes
i
am
very
fond
of
music
modern
music
he
said
leaning
against
the
mantelpiece
are
you
a
musician
by
profession
not
exactly
andrews
thrust
his
hands
into
the
bottoms
of
his
trouser
pockets
and
looked
from
one
to
the
other
with
a
certain
defiance
i
suppose
you
played
in
some
orchestra
how
is
it
you
are
not
in
the
regimental
band
no
except
the
the
pierian
were
you
at
harvard
andrews
nodded
so
was
is
that
a
coincidence
said
sheffield
i
so
glad
i
just
insisted
on
your
coming
what
year
were
you
asked
lieutenant
bleezer
with
a
faint
change
of
tone
drawing
a
finger
along
his
scant
black
moustache
i
have
graduated
yet
said
the
lieutenant
with
a
laugh
what
i
wanted
to
ask
you
sheffield
oh
my
boy
my
boy
you
know
you
known
me
long
enough
to
call
me
spence
broke
in
sheffield
i
want
to
know
went
on
andrews
speaking
slowly
can
you
help
me
to
get

on
the
list
to
be
sent
to
the
university
of
paris
i
know
that
a
list
has
been
made
out
although
the
general
order
has
not
come
yet
i
am
disliked
by
most
of
the
noncoms
and
i
do
see
how
i
can
get
on
without
somebody
help
i
simply
ca
go
this
life
any
andrews
closed
his
lips
firmly
and
looked
at
the
ground
his
face
flushing
well
a
man
of
your
attainments
certainly
ought
to
go
said
lieutenant
bleezer
with
a
faint
tremor
of
hesitation
in
his
voice
i
going
to
oxford
trust
me
my
boy
said
sheffield
i
fix
it
up
for
you
i
promise
let
shake
hands
on
he
seized
andrews
hand
and
pressed
it
warmly
in
a
moist
palm
if
it
within
human
power
within
human
power
he
added
well
i
must
go
said
lieutenant
bleezer
suddenly
striding
to
the
door
i
promised
the
marquise
i
drop
in
take
a
cigar
wo
you
he
held
out
three
cigars
in
the
direction
of
andrews
no
thank
oh
do
you
think
the
old
aristocracy
of
france
is
just
too
wonderful
lieutenant
bleezer
goes
almost
every
evening
to
call
on
the
marquise
de
rompemouville
he
says
she
is
just
too
spirituelle
for
words
he
often
meets
the
commanding
officer
andrews
had
dropped
into
a
chair
and
sat
with
his
face
buried
in
his
hands
looking
through
his
fingers
at
the
fire
where
a
few
white
fingers
of
flame
were
clutching
intermittently
at
a
grey
beech
log
his
mind
was
searching
desperately
for
expedients
he
got
to
his
feet
and
shouted
shrilly
i
ca
go
this
life
any
more
do
you
hear
that
no
possible
future
is
worth
all
this
if
i
can
get
to
paris
all
right
if
not
i
desert
and
damn
the
but
i
already
promised
i
do
all
i
can
well
do
it
now
interrupted
andrews
brutally
all
right
i
go
and
see
the
colonel
and
tell
him
what
a
great
musician
you
let
go
together
but
that
look
queer
dear
i
do
give
a
damn
come
along
you
can
talk
to
him
you
seem
to
be
thick
with
all
the
you
must
wait
till
i
tidy
up
said
sheffield
all
andrews
strode
up
and
down
in
the
mud
in
front
of
the
house
snapping
his
fingers
with
impatience
until
sheffield
came
out
then
they
walked
off
in
silence
now
wait
outside
a
minute
whispered
sheffield
when
they
came
to
the
white
house
with
bare
grapevines
over
the
front
where
the
colonel
lived
after
a
wait
andrews
found
himself
at
the
door
of
a
drawing
room
there
was
a
dense
smell
of
cigar
smoke
the
colonel
an
elderly
man
with
a
benevolent
beard
stood
before
him
with
a
coffee
cup
in
his
hand
andrews
saluted
punctiliously
they
tell
me
you
are
quite
a
pianist
sorry
i
did
know
it
before
said
the
colonel
in
a
kindly
tone
you
want
to
go
to
paris
to
study
under
this
new
scheme
yes
what
a
shame
i
did
know
before
the
list
of
the
men
going
is
all
made
out
of
course
perhaps
at
the
last
minute
if
somebody
else
does
go
your
name
can
go
the
colonel
smiled
graciously
and
turned
back
into
the
room
thank
you
colonel
said
andrews
saluting
without
a
word
to
sheffield
he
strode
off
down
the
dark
village
street
towards
his
quarters
andrews
stood
on
the
broad
village
street
where
the
mud
was
nearly
dry
and
a
wind
streaked
with
warmth
ruffled
the
few
puddles
he
was
looking
into
the
window
of
the
cafe
to
see
if
there
was
anyone
he
knew
inside
from
whom
he
could
borrow
money
for
a
drink
it
was
two
months
since
he
had
had
any
pay
and
his
pockets
were
empty
the
sun
had
just
set
on
a
premature
spring
afternoon
flooding
the
sky
and
the
grey
houses
and
the
tumultuous
tiled
roofs
with
warm
violet
light
the
faint
premonition
of
the
stirring
of
life
in
the
cold
earth
that
came
to
andrews
with
every
breath
he
drew
of
the
sparkling
wind
stung
his
dull
boredom
to
fury
it
was
the
first
of
march
he
was
telling
himself
over
and
over
again
the
fifteenth
of
february
he
had
expected
to
be
in
paris
free
or
at
least
able
to
work
it
was
the
first
of
march
and
here
he
was
still
helpless
still
tied
to
the
monotonous
wheel
of
routine
incapable
of
any
real
effort
spending
his
spare
time
wandering
like
a
lost
dog
up
and
down
this
muddy
street
from
the
hut
at
one
end
of
the
village
to
the
church
and
the
fountain
in
the
middle
and
to
the
divisional
headquarters
at
the
other
end
then
back
again
looking
listlessly
into
windows
staring
in
people
faces
without
seeing
them
he
had
given
up
all
hope
of
being
sent
to
paris
he
had
given
up
thinking
about
it
or
about
anything
the
same
dull
irritation
of
despair
droned
constantly
in
his
head
grinding
round
and
round
like
a
broken
phonograph
record
after
looking
a
long
while
in
the
window
of
the
cafe
of
the
braves
allies
he
walked
a
little
down
the
street
and
stood
in
the
same
position
staring
into
the
repos
du
poilu
where
a
large
sign
american
spoken
blocked
up
half
the
window
two
officers
passed
his
hand
snapped
up
to
the
salute
automatically
like
a
mechanical
signal
it
was
nearly
dark
after
a
while
he
began
to
feel
serious
coolness
in
the
wind
shivered
and
started
to
wander
aimlessly
down
the
street
he
recognised
walters
coming
towards
him
and
was
going
to
pass
him
without
speaking
when
walters
bumped
into
him
muttered
in
his
ear
come
to
baboon
and
hurried
off
with
his
swift
stride
andrews
stood
irresolutely
for
a
while
with
his
head
bent
then
went
with
unresilient
steps
up
the
alley
through
the
hole
in
the
hedge
and
into
babette
kitchen
there
was
no
fire
he
stared
morosely
at
the
grey
ashes
until
he
heard
walters
voice
beside
him
i
got
you
all
fixed
what
do
you
mean
mean
are
you
asleep
andrews
they
cut
a
name
off
the
school
list
that
all
now
if
you
shake
a
leg
and
somebody
does
get
in
ahead
of
you
you
be
in
paris
before
you
know
that
damn
decent
of
you
to
come
and
tell
here
your
application
said
walters
drawing
a
paper
out
of
his
pocket
take
it
to
the
colonel
get
him
to
it
and
then
rush
it
up
to
the
office
yourself
they
are
making
out
travel
orders
now
so
walters
had
vanished
andrews
was
alone
again
staring
at
the
grey
ashes
suddenly
he
jumped
to
his
feet
and
hurried
off
towards
headquarters
in
the
anteroom
to
the
colonel
office
he
waited
a
long
while
looking
at
his
boots
that
were
thickly
coated
with
mud
those
boots
will
make
a
bad
impression
those
boots
will
make
a
bad
impression
a
voice
was
saying
over
and
over
again
inside
of
him
a
lieutenant
was
also
waiting
to
see
the
colonel
a
young
man
with
pink
cheeks
and
a
forehead
who
held
his
hat
in
one
hand
with
a
pair
of
kid
gloves
and
kept
passing
a
hand
over
his
light
hair
andrews
felt
dirty
and
in
his
uniform
the
sight
of
this
perfect
young
man
in
his
whipcord
breeches
with
his
manicured
nails
and
immaculately
polished
puttees
exasperated
him
he
would
have
liked
to
fight
him
to
prove
that
he
was
the
better
man
to
outwit
him
to
make
him
forget
his
rank
and
his
important
air
the
lieutenant
had
gone
in
to
see
the
colonel
andrews
found
himself
reading
a
chart
of
some
sort
tacked
up
on
the
wall
there
were
names
and
dates
and
figures
but
he
could
not
make
out
what
it
was
about
all
right
go
ahead
whispered
the
orderly
to
him
and
he
was
standing
with
his
cap
in
his
hand
before
the
colonel
who
was
looking
at
him
severely
fingering
the
papers
he
had
on
the
desk
with
a
heavily
veined
hand
andrews
saluted
the
colonel
made
an
impatient
gesture
may
i
speak
to
you
colonel
about
the
school
scheme
i
suppose
you
got
permission
from
somebody
to
come
to
no
andrews
mind
was
struggling
to
find
something
to
say
well
you
better
go
and
get
but
colonel
there
is
time
the
travel
orders
are
being
made
out
at
this
minute
i

accustomed

a
man
in
your
position
in
the
world
colonel
must
know
what
even
a
few
months
of
study
in
paris
mean
to
a
the
colonel
smiled
let
see
your
application
he
said
andrews
handed
it
to
him
with
a
trembling
hand
the
colonel
made
a
few
marks
on
one
corner
with
a
pencil
now
if
you
can
get
that
to
the
in
time
to
have
your
name
included
in
the
orders
well
and
andrews
saluted
and
hurried
out
a
sudden
feeling
of
nausea
had
come
over
him
he
was
hardly
able
to
control
a
mad
desire
to
tear
the
paper
up
the
sons
of
bitches
the
sons
of
bitches
he
muttered
to
himself
still
he
ran
all
the
way
to
the
square
isolated
building
where
the
regimental
office
was
he
stopped
panting
in
front
of
the
desk
that
bore
the
little
red
card
regimental
the
regimental
looked
up
at
him
enquiringly
here
an
application
for
school
at
the
sorbonne
sergeant
colonel
wilkins
told
me
to
run
up
to
you
with
it
said
he
was
very
anxious
to
have
it
go
in
at
too
late
said
the
regimental
but
the
colonel
said
it
had
to
go
ca
help
it
too
late
said
the
regimental
andrews
felt
the
room
and
the
men
in
their
shirt
sleeves
at
the
typewriters
and
the
three
nymphs
creeping
from
behind
the
french
war
loan
poster
whirl
round
his
head
suddenly
he
heard
a
voice
behind
him
is
the
name
andrews
john
sarge
how
the
hell
should
i
know
said
the
regimental
because
i
got
it
in
the
orders
already
i
do
know
how
it
got
the
voice
was
walters
voice
staccatto
and
businesslike
well
then
why
want
to
bother
me
about
it
give
me
that
the
regimental
jerked
the
paper
out
of
andrews
hand
and
looked
at
it
savagely
all
right
you
leave
tomorrow
a
copy
of
the
orders
go
to
your
company
in
the
morning
growled
the
regimental
andrews
looked
hard
at
walters
as
he
went
out
but
got
no
glance
in
return
when
he
stood
in
the
air
again
disgust
surged
up
within
him
bitterer
than
before
the
fury
of
his
humiliation
made
tears
start
in
his
eyes
he
walked
away
from
the
village
down
the
main
road
splashing
carelessly
through
the
puddles
slipping
in
the
wet
clay
of
the
ditches
something
within
him
like
the
voice
of
a
wounded
man
swearing
was
whining
in
his
head
long
strings
of
filthy
names
after
walking
a
long
while
he
stopped
suddenly
with
his
fists
clenched
it
was
completely
dark
the
sky
was
faintly
marbled
by
a
moon
behind
the
clouds
on
both
sides
of
the
road
rose
the
tall
grey
skeletons
of
poplars
when
the
sound
of
his
footsteps
stopped
he
heard
a
faint
lisp
of
running
water
standing
still
in
the
middle
of
the
road
he
felt
his
feelings
gradually
relax
he
said
aloud
in
a
low
voice
several
times
you
are
a
damn
fool
john
andrews
and
started
walking
slowly
and
thoughtfully
back
to
the
village
v
andrews
felt
an
arm
put
round
his
shoulder
ah
been
to
hell
an
gone
lookin
for
you
andy
said
voice
in
his
ear
jerking
him
out
of
the
reverie
he
walked
in
he
could
feel
in
his
face
chrisfield

heavy
with
cognac

the
back
room
at
chrisfield
hung
on
his
shoulder
walking
unsteadily
beside
him
at
the
hole
in
the
hedge
chrisfield
stumbled
and
nearly
pulled
them
both
down
they
laughed
and
still
laughing
staggered
into
the
dark
kitchen
where
they
found
the
woman
with
her
baby
sitting
beside
the
fire
with
no
other
light
than
the
flicker
of
the
rare
flames
that
shot
up
from
a
little
mass
of
wood
embers
the
baby
started
crying
shrilly
when
the
two
soldiers
stamped
in
the
woman
got
up
and
talking
automatically
to
the
baby
all
the
while
went
off
to
get
a
light
and
wine
andrews
looked
at
chrisfield
face
by
the
firelight
his
cheeks
had
lost
the
faint
childish
roundness
they
had
had
when
andrews
had
first
talked
to
him
sweeping
up
cigarette
butts
off
the
walk
in
front
of
the
barracks
at
the
training
camp

in
the
oregon
forest
he

tired

said
chrisfield
the
woman
came
through
the
door
at
the
end
of
the
kitchen
with
a
candle
in
her
hand
chrisfield
stopped
speaking
suddenly

on
the
back
of
his
hand
d

bridge

they
were
silent
again
staring
at
the
fading
embers
of
the
fire
in
the
dim
edge
of
the
candlelight
the
woman
stood
with
her
hands
on
her
hips
looking
at
them
fixedly
reckon
a
feller
would
know
what
to
do
with
himself
if
he
did
get
out
of
the
army
now
would
he
andy
so
long
chris
i
beating

said
andrews
in
a
harsh
voice
jumping
to
his
feet
so
long
andy
ole
man
ah
pay
for
the
chrisfield
was
beckoning
with
his
hand
to
the
woman
who
advanced
slowly
through
the
candlelight
thanks
andrews
strode
away
from
the
door
a
cold
rain
was
falling
he
pulled
up
his
coat
collar
and
ran
down
the
muddy
village
street
towards
his
quarters
vi
in
the
opposite
corner
of
the
compartment
andrews
could
see
walters
hunched
up
in
an
attitude
of
sleep
with
his
cap
pulled
down
far
over
his
eyes
his
mouth
was
open
and
his
head
wagged
with
the
jolting
of
the
train
the
shade
over
the
light
plunged
the
compartment
in
obscurity
which
made
the
night
sky
outside
the
window
and
the
shapes
of
trees
and
houses
evolving
and
pirouetting
as
they
glided
by
seem
very
near
andrews
felt
no
desire
to
sleep
he
had
sat
a
long
time
leaning
his
head
against
the
frame
of
the
window
looking
out
at
the
fleeing
shadows
and
the
occasional
little
lights
that
darted
by
and
the
glow
of
the
stations
that
flared
for
a
moment
and
were
lost
in
dark
silhouettes
of
unlighted
houses
and
skeleton
trees
and
black
hillsides
he
was
thinking
how
all
the
epochs
in
his
life
seemed
to
have
been
marked
out
by
railway
rides
at
night
the
jolting
rumble
of
the
wheels
made
the
blood
go
faster
through
his
veins
made
him
feel
acutely
the
clattering
of
the
train
along
the
gleaming
rails
spurning
fields
and
trees
and
houses
piling
up
miles
and
miles
between
the
past
and
future
the
gusts
of
cold
night
air
when
he
opened
the
window
and
the
faint
whiffs
of
steam
and
coal
gas
that
tingled
in
his
nostrils
excited
him
like
a
smile
on
a
strange
face
seen
for
a
moment
in
a
crowded
street
he
did
not
think
of
what
he
had
left
behind
he
was
straining
his
eyes
eagerly
through
the
darkness
towards
the
vivid
life
he
was
going
to
live
boredom
and
abasement
were
over
he
was
free
to
work
and
hear
music
and
make
friends
he
drew
deep
breaths
warm
waves
of
vigor
seemed
flowing
constantly
from
his
lungs
and
throat
to
his
finger
tips
and
down
through
his
body
and
the
muscles
of
his
legs
he
looked
at
his
watch
in
six
hours
he
would
be
in
paris
for
six
hours
he
would
sit
there
looking
out
at
the
fleeting
shadows
of
the
countryside
feeling
in
his
blood
the
eager
throb
of
the
train
rejoicing
in
every
mile
the
train
carried
him
away
from
things
past
walters
still
slept
half
slipping
off
the
seat
with
his
mouth
open
and
his
overcoat
bundled
round
his
head
andrews
looked
out
of
the
window
feeling
in
his
nostrils
the
tingle
of
steam
and
coal
gas
a
phrase
out
of
some
translation
of
the
iliad
came
to
his
head
ambrosial
night
night
ambrosial
but
better
than
sitting
round
a
camp
fire
drinking
wine
and
water
and
listening
to
the
boastful
yarns
of
achaeans
was
this
hustling
through
the
countryside
away
from
the
monotonous
whine
of
past
unhappiness
towards
joyousness
and
life
andrews
began
to
think
of
the
men
he
had
left
behind
they
were
asleep
at
this
time
of
night
in
barns
and
barracks
or
else
standing
on
guard
with
cold
damp
feet
and
cold
hands
which
the
icy
rifle
barrel
burned
when
they
tended
it
he
might
go
far
away
out
of
sound
of
the
tramp
of
marching
away
from
the
smell
of
overcrowded
barracks
where
men
slept
in
rows
like
cattle
but
he
would
still
be
one
of
them
he
would
not
see
an
officer
pass
him
without
an
unconscious
movement
of
servility
he
would
not
hear
a
bugle
without
feeling
sick
with
hatred
if
he
could
only
express
these
thwarted
lives
the
miserable
dullness
of
industrialized
slaughter
it
might
have
been
almost
worth
while
for
him
for
the
others
it
would
never
be
worth
while
but
you
talking
as
if
you
were
out
of
the
woods
you
a
soldier
still
john
the
words
formed
themselves
in
his
mind
as
vividly
as
if
he
had
spoken
them
he
smiled
bitterly
and
settled
himself
again
to
watch
silhouettes
of
trees
and
hedges
and
houses
and
hillsides
fleeing
against
the
dark
sky
when
he
awoke
the
sky
was
grey
the
train
was
moving
slowly
clattering
loudly
over
switches
through
a
town
of
wet
slate
roofs
that
rose
in
fantastic
patterns
of
shadow
above
the
blue
mist
walters
was
smoking
a
cigarette
god
these
french
trains
are
rotten
he
said
when
he
noticed
that
andrews
was
awake
the
most
inefficient
country
i
ever
was
in
inefficiency
be
damned
broke
in
andrews
jumping
up
and
stretching
himself
he
opened
the
window
the
heating
too
damned
efficient
i
think
we
near
the
cold
air
with
a
flavor
of
mist
in
it
poured
into
the
stuffy
compartment
every
breath
was
joy
andrews
felt
a
crazy
buoyancy
bubbling
up
in
him
the
rumbling
clatter
of
the
train
wheels
sang
in
his
ears
he
threw
himself
on
his
back
on
the
dusty
blue
seat
and
kicked
his
heels
in
the
air
like
a
colt
liven
up
for
god
sake
man
he
shouted
we
getting
near
we
are
lucky
bastards
said
walters
grinning
with
the
cigarette
hanging
out
of
the
corner
of
his
mouth
i
going
to
see
if
i
can
find
the
rest
of
the
andrews
alone
in
the
compartment
found
himself
singing
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
as
the
day
brightened
the
mist
lifted
off
the
flat
fields
intersected
by
rows
of
leafless
poplars
houses
with
blue
roofs
wore
already
a
faintly
citified
air
they
passed
and
with
reddish
puddles
of
water
in
the
bottom
of
them
crossed
a
river
where
a
long
file
of
canal
boats
with
bright
paint
on
their
prows
moved
slowly
the
engine
whistled
shrilly
they
clattered
through
a
small
freight
yard
and
rows
of
suburban
houses
began
to
form
at
first
chaotically
in
broad
patches
of
and
then
in
orderly
ranks
with
streets
between
and
shops
at
the
corners
a
dripping
wall
rose
up
suddenly
and
blotted
out
the
view
the
train
slowed
down
and
went
through
several
stations
crowded
with
people
on
their
way
to
work
ordinary
people
in
varied
clothes
with
only
here
and
there
a
blue
or
khaki
uniform
then
there
was
more
wall
and
the
obscurity
of
wide
bridges
under
which
dusty
oil
lamps
burned
orange
and
red
making
a
gleam
on
the
wet
wall
above
them
and
where
the
wheels
clanged
loudly
more
freight
yards
and
the
train
pulled
slowly
past
other
trains
full
of
faces
and
silhouettes
of
people
to
stop
with
a
jerk
in
a
station
and
andrews
was
standing
on
the
grey
cement
platform
sniffing
smells
of
lumber
and
merchandise
and
steam
his
ungainly
pack
and
he
carried
on
his
shoulder
like
a
cross
he
had
left
his
rifle
and
cartridge
belt
carefully
tucked
out
of
sight
under
the
seat
walters
and
five
other
men
straggled
along
the
platform
towards
him
carrying
or
dragging
their
packs
there
was
a
look
of
apprehension
on
walters
face
well
what

said

andrews
and
he
burst

the
company
tramped
off
along
the
muddy
road
their
steps
were
all
the
same
length
their
arms
swung
in
the
same
rhythm
their
faces
were
cowed
into
the
same
expression
their
thoughts
were
the
same
the
tramp
tramp
of
their
steps
died
away
along
the
road
birds
were
singing
among
the
budding
trees
the
young
grass
by
the
roadside
kept
the
marks
of
the
soldiers
bodies
part
five
the
world
outside
andrews
and
six
other
men
from
his
division
sat
at
a
table
outside
the
cafe
opposite
the
gare
de
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
with
a
cup
of
coffee
lifted
looking
across
it
at
the
stone
houses
with
many
balconies
steam
scented
of
milk
and
coffee
rose
from
the
cup
as
he
sipped
from
it
his
ears
were
full
of
a
rumble
of
traffic
and
a
clacking
of
heels
as
people
walked
briskly
by
along
the
damp
pavements
for
a
while
he
did
not
hear
what
the
men
he
was
sitting
with
were
saying
they
talked
and
laughed
but
he
looked
beyond
their
khaki
uniforms
and
their
caps
unconsciously
he
was
taken
up
with
the
smell
of
the
coffee
and
of
the
mist
a
little
rusty
sunshine
shone
on
the
table
of
the
cafe
and
on
the
thin
varnish
of
wet
mud
that
covered
the
asphalt
pavement
looking
down
the
avenue
away
from
the
station
the
houses
dark
grey
tending
to
greenish
in
the
shadow
and
to
violet
in
the
sun
faded
into
a
soft
haze
of
distance
dull
gilt
lettering
glittered
along
black
balconies
in
the
foreground
were
men
and
women
walking
briskly
their
cheeks
whipped
a
little
into
color
by
the
rawness
of
the
morning
the
sky
was
a
faintly
roseate
grey
walters
was
speaking
the
first
thing
i
want
to
see
is
the
eiffel
why

to
see
that
said
the
small
sergeant
with
a
black
mustache
and
rings
round
his
eyes
like
a
monkey
why
man
do
you
know
that
everything
begins
from
the
eiffel
tower
if
it
were
for
the
eiffel
tower

any
how
about
the
flatiron
building
and

time
anyway
the
over

lamps

a
real
parizianne
said
a
burly
unshaven
man
with
a
corporal
stripes
on
his
arm
roaring
with
laughter
andrews
lost
track
of
the
talk
again
staring
dreamily
through
eyes
down
the
long
straight
street
where
greens
and
violets
and
browns
merged
into
a
bluish
grey
monochrome
at
a
little
distance
he
wanted
to
be
alone
to
wander
at
random
through
the
city
to
stare
dreamily
at
people
and
things
to
talk
by
chance
to
men
and
women
to
sink
his
life
into
the
misty
sparkling
life
of
the
streets
the
smell
of
the
mist
brought
a
memory
to
his
mind
for
a
long
while
he
groped
for
it
until
suddenly
he
remembered
his
dinner
with
henslowe
and
the
faces
of
the
boy
and
girl
he
had
talked
to
on
the
butte
he
must
find
henslowe
at
once
a
second
fierce
resentment
went
through
him
against
all
these
people
about
him
christ
he
must
get
away
from
them
all
his
freedom
had
been
hard
enough
won
he
must
enjoy
it
to
the
uttermost
say
i
going
to
stick
to
you
walters
voice
broke
into
his
reverie
i
going
to

corps
of

laughed

andy
i
wait
for
you
there
walters
called
after
him
andrews
darted
down
a
side
street
he
could
hardly
keep
from
shouting
aloud
when
he
found
himself
alone
free
with
days
and
days
ahead
of
him
to
work
and
think
gradually
to
rid
his
limbs
of
the
stiff
attitudes
of
the
automaton
the
smell
of
the
streets
and
the
mist
indefinably
poignant
rose
like
incense
smoke
in
fantastic
spirals
through
his
brain
making
him
hungry
and
dazzled
making
his
arms
and
legs
feel
lithe
and
as
ready
for
delight
as
a
crouching
cat
for
a
spring
his
heavy
shoes
beat
out
a
dance
as
they
clattered
on
the
wet
pavements
under
his
springy
steps
he
was
walking
very
fast
stopping
suddenly
now
and
then
to
look
at
the
greens
and
oranges
and
crimsons
of
vegetables
in
a
push
cart
to
catch
a
vista
down
intricate
streets
to
look
into
the
rich
brown
obscurity
of
a
small
wine
shop
where
workmen
stood
at
the
counter
sipping
white
wine
oval
delicate
faces
bearded
faces
of
men
slightly
gaunt
faces
of
young
women
red
cheeks
of
boys
wrinkled
faces
of
old
women
whose
ugliness
seemed
to
have
hidden
in
it
stirringly
all
the
beauty
of
youth
and
the
tragedy
of
lives
that
had
been
lived
the
faces
of
the
people
he
passed
moved
him
like
rhythms
of
an
orchestra
after
much
walking
turning
always
down
the
street
which
looked
pleasantest
he
came
to
an
oval
with
a
statue
of
a
pompous
personage
on
a
ramping
horse
place
des
victoires
he
read
the
name
which
gave
him
a
faint
tinge
of
amusement
he
looked
quizzically
at
the
heroic
features
of
the
sun
king
and
walked
off
laughing
i
suppose
they
did
it
better
in
those
days
the
grand
manner
he
muttered
and
his
delight
redoubled
in
rubbing
shoulders
with
the
people
whose
effigies
would
never
appear
astride
horses
in
squares
built
to
commemorate
victories
he
came
out
on
a
broad
straight
avenue
where
there
were
many
american
officers
he
had
to
salute
and
and
shops
with
wide
windows
full
of
objects
that
had
a
shiny
expensive
look
another
case
of
victories
he
thought
as
he
went
off
into
a
side
street
taking
with
him
a
glimpse
of
the
pile
of
the
opera
with
its
pompous
windows
and
its
naked
bronze
ladies
holding
lamps
he
was
in
a
narrow
street
full
of
hotels
and
fashionable
barber
shops
from
which
came
an
odor
of
cosmopolitan
perfumery
of
casinos
and
ballrooms
and
diplomatic
receptions
when
he
noticed
an
american
officer
coming
towards
him
reeling
a
little
a
tall
elderly
man
with
a
red
face
and
a
bottle
nose
he
saluted
the
officer
stopped
still
swaying
from
side
to
side
and
said
in
a
whining
voice
shonny

andrews
who
felt
himself
enveloped
in
an
odor
of

the

the
major
but

with
amusement
at
the
crowd
of
american
officers
and
civilians
who
crowded
into
the
small
mahogany
barroom
when
a
voice
behind

andrews
laughing
what

devotion

belly

a
great
thing
for
the
people
who
knew
how
to
take
advantage
of
it
just
look
at
their
i
guess
they
know
how
to
make
a
good
thing
of
the
peace
oh
that
going
to
be
the
best
yet
come
along
let
be
little
devils
and
take
a
this
certainly
is
the
main
street
of
they
threaded
their
way
through
the
crowd
full
of
uniforms
and
glitter
and
bright
colors
that
moved
in
two
streams
up
and
down
the
wide
sidewalk
between
the
cafes
and
the
boles
of
the
bare
trees
they
climbed
into
a
taxi
and
lurched
fast
through
streets
where
in
the
misty
sunlight
and
mingled
with
blues
and
pale
lights
as
the
colors
mingle
in
a
pigeon
breast
feathers
they
passed
the
leafless
gardens
of
the
tuileries
on
one
side
and
the
great
inner
courts
of
the
louvre
with
their
purple
mansard
roofs
and
their
high
chimneys
on
the
other
and
saw
for
a
second
the
river
dull
jade
green
and
the
plane
trees
splotched
with
brown
and
cream
color
along
the
quais
before
they
were
lost
in
the
narrow
streets
of
the
old
quarters
this
is
paris
that
was
cosmopolis
said
henslowe
i
not
particular
just
at
present
cried
andrews
gaily
the
square
in
front
of
the
odeon
was
a
splash
of
white
and
the
collonade
a
blur
of
darkness
as
the
cab
swerved
round
the
corner
and
along
the
edge
of
the
luxembourg
where
through
the
black
iron
fence
many
brown
and
reddish
colors
in
the
intricate
patterns
of
leafless
twigs
opened
here
and
there
on
statues
and
balustrades
and
vistas
of
misty
distances
the
cab
stopped
with
a
jerk
this
is
the
place
des
medicis
said
henslowe
at
the
end
of
a
slanting
street
looking
very
flat
through
the
haze
was
the
dome
of
the
pantheon
in
the
middle
of
the
square
between
the
yellow
trams
and
the
green
low
busses
was
a
quiet
pool
where
the
shadow
of
horizontals
of
the
house
fronts
was
reflected
they
sat
beside
the
window
looking
out
at
the
square
henslowe
ordered
remember
how
sentimental
history
books
used
to
talk
about
prisoners
who
were
let
out
after
years
in
dungeons
not
being
able
to
stand
it
and
going
back
to
their
cells
like
sole
meuniere
anything
or
rather
everything
but
take
it
from
me
that
all
rubbish
honestly
i
do
think
i
ever
been
happier
in
my
life
know
henslowe
there
something
in
you
that
is
afraid
to
be
do
be
morbid
there
only
one
real
evil
in
the
world
being
somewhere
without
being
able
to
get
away
i
ordered
beer
this
is
the
only
place
in
paris
where
it
fit
to
and
i
going
to
every
blooming
concert
on
sunday
i
know
that
the
only
evil
in
the
world
is
not
to
be
able
to
hear
music
or
to
make
it
these
oysters
are
fit
for
why
not
say
fit
for
john
andrews
and
bob
henslowe
damn
it
why
the
ghosts
of
poor
old
dead
romans
should
be
dragged
in
every
time
a
man
eats
an
oyster
i
do
see
we
as
fine
specimens
as
they
were
i
swear
i
sha
let
any
old
lucullus
outlive
me
even
if
i
never
eaten
a
and
why
should
you
eat
a
lamp
chimney
bob
came
a
hoarse
voice
beside
them
andrews
looked
up
into
a
round
white
face
with
large
grey
eyes
hidden
behind
thick
spectacles
except
for
the
eyes
the
face
had
a
vaguely
chinese
air
hello
heinz
andrews
heineman
said
henslowe
glad
to
meet
you
said
heineman
in
a
jovially
hoarse
voice
you
guys
seem
to
be
overeating
to
reckon
by
the
way
things
are
piled
up
on
the
through
the
hoarseness
andrews
could
detect
a
faint
yankee
tang
in
heineman
voice

sit
down
and
help

said
henslowe

my
name

a
bread
stick
to
keep
time
shut
up
heinz
or

out
of

laughed
an
remember
monsieur
le
guy

they
laughed
till
the
tears
ran
down
their
cheeks
heineman
took
off
his
glasses
and
wiped
them
he
turned
to
andrews
oh

its
nine
hundred
and
branches
second
absurdity

broke
out
laughing
again
his
chunky
body
rolling
about
on
the
chair
what
are
they
three
of
them
have
sworn
to

heineman
but

he
said
suddenly
in
a
petulant
voice
garcon

what

next

with

oh

only
prayer

day

red
worker
permit
and
the
red

the
heineman
laughed
till
the
glasses
rang
on
the
table
he
took
off
his
glasses
and
wiped
them
with
a
rueful
air
so
now
i
call
the
red
cross
the
cadets
cried
heineman
his
voice
a
thin
shriek
from
laughter
andrews
was
drinking
his
coffee
in
little
sips
looking
out
of
the
window
at
the
people
that
passed
an
old
woman
with
a
stand
of
flowers
sat
on
a
small
cane
chair
at
the
corner
the
pink
and
yellow
and
shades
of
the
flowers
seemed
to
intensify
the
misty
straw
color
and
azured
grey
of
the
wintry
sun
and
shadow
of
the
streets
a
girl
in
a
black
dress
and
black
hat
stopped
at
the
stand
to
buy
a
bunch
of
pale
yellow
daisies
and
then
walked
slowly
past
the
window
of
the
restaurant
in
the
direction
of
the
gardens
her
ivory
face
and
slender
body
and
her
very
dark
eyes
sent
a
sudden
flush
through
andrews
whole
frame
as
he
looked
at
her
the
black
erect
figure
disappeared
in
the
gate
of
the
gardens
andrews
got
to
his
feet
suddenly
i
got
to
go
he
said
in
a
strange
voice
i
just
remember
a
man
was
waiting
for
me
at
the
school
let
him
why
you
have
had
a
liqueur
yet
cried
heineman
no
but
where
can
i
meet
you
people
later
cafe
de
rohan
at
five
opposite
the
palais
you
never
find
yes
i
will
said
andrews
palais
royal
metro
station
they
shouted
after
him
as
he
dashed
out
of
the
door
he
hurried
into
the
gardens
many
people
sat
on
benches
in
the
frail
sunlight
children
in
clothes
ran
about
chasing
hoops
a
woman
paraded
a
bunch
of
toy
balloons
in
carmine
and
green
and
purple
like
a
huge
bunch
of
grapes
inverted
above
her
head
andrews
walked
up
and
down
the
alleys
scanning
faces
the
girl
had
disappeared
he
leaned
against
a
grey
balustrade
and
looked
down
into
the
empty
pond
where
traces
of
the
explosion
of
a
bertha
still
subsisted
he
was
telling
himself
that
he
was
a
fool
that
even
if
he
had
found
her
he
could
not
have
spoken
to
her
just
because
he
was
free
for
a
day
or
two
from
the
army
he
need
think
the
age
of
gold
had
come
back
to
earth
smiling
at
the
thought
he
walked
across
the
gardens
wandered
through
some
streets
of
old
houses
in
grey
and
white
stucco
with
slate
mansard
roofs
and
fantastic
complications
of
till
he
came
out
in
front
of
a
church
with
a
new
classic
facade
of
huge
columns
that
seemed
toppling
by
their
own
weight
he
asked
a
woman
selling
newspapers
what
the
church
name
was
mais
monsieur
saint
sulpice
said
the
woman
in
a
surprised
tone
saint
sulpice
manon
songs
came
to
his
head
and
the
sentimental
melancholy
of
eighteenth
century
paris
with
its
gambling
houses
in
the
palais
royal
where
people
dishonored
themselves
in
the
presence
of
their
stern
catonian
fathers
and
its
billets
doux
written
at
little
gilt
tables
and
its
coaches
lumbering
in
covered
with
mud
from
the
provinces
through
the
porte
and
the
porte
de
versailles
the
paris
of
diderot
and
voltaire
and
with
its
muddy
streets
and
its
ordinaries
where
one
ate
bisques
and
larded
pullets
and
souffles
a
paris
full
of
mouldy
gilt
magnificence
full
of
pompous
ennui
of
the
past
and
insane
hope
of
the
future
he
walked
down
a
narrow
smoky
street
full
of
antique
shops
and
old
bookshops
and
came
out
unexpectedly
on
the
river
opposite
the
statue
of
voltaire
the
name
on
the
corner
was
quai
malaquais
andrews
crossed
and
looked
down
for
a
long
time
at
the
river
opposite
behind
a
of
leafless
trees
were
the
purplish
roofs
of
the
louvre
with
their
high
peaks
and
their
ranks
and
ranks
of
chimneys
behind
him
the
old
houses
of
the
quai
and
the
wing
topped
by
a
balustrade
with
great
grey
stone
urns
of
a
domed
building
of
which
he
did
not
know
the
name
barges
were
coming
upstream
the
dense
green
water
spuming
under
their
blunt
bows
towed
by
a
little
black
tugboat
with
its
chimney
bent
back
to
pass
under
the
bridges
the
tug
gave
a
thin
shrill
whistle
andrews
started
walking
downstream
he
crossed
by
the
bridge
at
the
corner
of
the
louvre
turned
his
back
on
the
arch
napoleon
built
to
receive
the
famous
horses
from
marc
a
pinkish
affair
and
walked
through
the
tuileries
which
were
full
of
people
strolling
about
or
sitting
in
the
sun
of
children
and
nursemaids
with
elaborate
white
caps
of
fluffy
little
dogs
straining
at
the
ends
of
leashes
suddenly
a
peaceful
sleepiness
came
over
him
he
sat
down
in
the
sun
on
a
bench
watching
hardly
seeing
them
the
people
who
passed
to
and
fro
casting
long
shadows
voices
and
laughter
came
very
softly
to
his
ears
above
the
distant
stridency
of
traffic
from
far
away
he
heard
for
a
few
moments
notes
of
a
military
band
playing
a
march
the
shadows
of
the
trees
were
faint
in
the
ruddy
yellow
gravel
shadows
of
people
kept
passing
and
repassing
across
them
he
felt
very
languid
and
happy
suddenly
he
started
up
he
had
been
dozing
he
asked
an
old
man
with
a
beautifully
pointed
white
beard
the
way
to
rue
du
faubourg
honore
after
losing
his
way
a
couple
of
times
he
walked
listlessly
up
some
marble
steps
where
a
great
many
men
in
khaki
were
talking
leaning
against
the
doorpost
was
walters
as
he
drew
near
andrews
heard
him
saying
to
the
man
next
to
him
why
the
eiffel
tower
was
the
first
piece
of
complete
girder
construction
ever
built
that
the
first
thing
a
feller
who
wide
awake
ought
to
tell
me
the
opery

grandest
thing

the
man

said
andrews
moving
away

i
coming
with
you
we
walk
around
town
all
right
said
andrews
the
rabbit
was
rather
formless
very
fluffy
and
had
a
glance
of
madness
in
its
pink
eye
with
a
black
center
it
hopped
like
a
sparrow
along
the
pavement
emitting
a
rubber
tube
from
its
back
which
went
up
to
a
bulb
in
a
man
hand
which
the
man
pressed
to
make
the
rabbit
hop
yet
the
rabbit
had
an
air
of
organic
completeness
andrews
laughed
inordinately
when
he
first
saw
it
the
vendor
who
had
a
basket
full
of
other
such
rabbits
on
his
arm
saw
andrews
laughing
and
drew
timidly
near
to
the
table
he
had
a
pink
face
with
little
sensitive
lips
rather
like
a
real
rabbit
and
large
frightened
eyes
of
a
wan
brown
do
you
make
them
yourself
asked
andrews
smiling
the
man
dropped
his
rabbit
on
the
table
with
a
negligent
air
oh
oui
monsieur
la
he
made
the
rabbit
turn
a
somersault
by
suddenly
pressing
the
bulb
hard
andrews
laughed
and
the
rabbit
man
laughed
think
of
a
big
strong
man
making
his
living
that
way
said
walters
disgusted
i
do
it
all
de
matiere
premiere
au
profit
de
said
the
rabbit
man
hello
andy
late
as
hell
i
sorry
said
henslowe
dropping
down
into
a
chair
beside
them
andrews
introduced
walters
the
rabbit
man
took
off
his
hat
bowed
to
the
company
and
went
off
making
the
rabbit
hop
before
him
along
the
edge
of
the
curbstone
what
happened

said
henslowe
an
open
cab
had
driven
up
to
the
curb
in
front
of
the
cafe
in
it
sat
heineman
with
a
broad
grin
on
his
face
and
beside
him
a
woman
in
a
dress
ermine
furs
and
an
hat
the
cab
drove
off
and
heineman
still
grinning
walked
up
to
the
table
where
the
lion
cub
asked
henslowe

mr
heineman
the
grin
left
heineman
face
he
said
how

curtly
cast
a
furious
glance
at
andrews
and
settled
himself
in
a
chair
the
sun
had
set
the
sky
was
full
of
lilac
and
bright
purple
and
carmine
among
the
deep
blue
shadows
lights
were
coming
on
street
lamps
violet
arc
lights
ruddy
sheets
of
light
poured
out
of
shop
windows

heineman
crossly
and
they
filed
in
through
the
revolving
door
followed
by
a
waiter
with
their
drinks
i

red
cross

you
ca

said
walters
true
enough
you
sure

need
them
both
said
heineman
andrews
was
not
listening
to
their
talk
twirling
the
stem
of
his
glass
of
vermouth
in
his
fingers
he
was
thinking
of
the
queen
of
sheba
slipping
down
from
off
the
shoulders
of
her
elephant
glistening
fantastically
with
jewels
in
the
light
of
crackling
resinous
torches
music
was
seeping
up
through
his
mind
as
the
water
seeps
into
a
hole
dug
in
the
sand
of
the
seashore
he
could
feel
all
through
his
body
the
tension
of
rhythms
and
phrases
taking
form
not
quite
to
be
seized
as
yet
still
hovering
on
the
borderland
of
consciousness
from
the
girl
at
the
singing
under
her
to
the
patrician
pulling
roses
to
pieces
from
the
height
of
her
litter
the
imaginings
of
your
desire
he
thought
of
the
girl
with
skin
like
old
ivory
he
had
seen
in
the
place
de
medicis
the
queen
of
sheba
face
was
like
that
now
in
his
imaginings
quiet
and
inscrutable
a
sudden
of
joy
made
his
heart
thump
hard
he
was
free
now
of
the
imaginings
of
his
desire
to
loll
all
day
at
cafe
tables
watching
the
tables
move
in
changing
patterns
before
him
to
fill
his
mind
and
body
with
a
reverberation
of
all
the
rhythms
of
men
and
women
moving
in
the
frieze
of
life
before
his
eyes
no
more
like
wooden
automatons
knowing
only
the
motions
of
the
drill
manual
but
supple
and
varied
full
of
force
and
tragedy
for
heaven
sake
let
beat
it
from
here
gives
me
a
pain
this
place
heineman
beat
his
fist
on
the
table
all
right
said
andrews
getting
up
with
a
yawn
henslowe
and
andrews
walked
off
leaving
walters
to
follow
them
with
heineman
we
going
to
dine
at
le
rat
qui
danse
said
henslowe
an
awfully
funny
place
we
just
have
time
to
walk
there
comfortably
with
an
they
followed
the
long
rue
de
richelieu
to
the
boulevards
where
they
drifted
a
little
while
with
the
crowd
the
glaring
lights
seemed
to
powder
the
air
with
gold
cafes
and
the
tables
outside
were
crowded
there
was
an
odor
of
vermouth
and
coffee
and
perfume
and
cigarette
smoke
mixed
with
the
fumes
of
burnt
gasoline
from
taxicabs
is
this
mad
said
andrews
it
always
carnival
at
seven
on
the
grands
they
started
climbing
the
steep
streets
to
montmartre
at
a
corner
they
passed
a
girl
with
lips
and
overpowdered
cheeks
laughing
on
the
arm
of
an
american
soldier
who
had
a
sallow
face
and
eyes
that
glittered
in
the
slanting
light
of
a
hello
stein
said
andrews
who
that
a
fellow
from
our
division
got
here
with
me
this
he
got
curious
lips
for
a
jew
said
henslowe
at
the
fork
of
two
slanting
streets
they
went
into
a
restaurant
that
had
small
windows
pasted
over
with
red
paper
through
which
the
light
came
dimly
inside
were
crowded
oak
tables
and
oak
wainscoting
with
a
shelf
round
the
top
on
which
were
a
couple
of
skulls
several
cracked
majolica
plates
and
a
number
of
stuffed
rats
the
only
people
there
were
a
fat
woman
and
a
man
with
long
grey
hair
and
beard
who
sat
talking
earnestly
over
two
small
glasses
in
the
center
of
the
room
a
waitress
with
a
dutch
cap
and
apron
hovered
near
the
inner
door
from
which
came
a
great
smell
of
fish
frying
in
olive
oil
the
cook
here
from
marseilles
said
henslowe
as
they
settled
themselves
at
a
table
for
four
i
wonder
if
the
rest
of
them
lost
the
way
said
andrews
more
likely
old
heinz
stopped
to
have
a
drink
said
henslowe
have
some
hors
while
we
are
the
waitress
brought
a
collection
of
plates
of
red
salads
and
yellow
salads
and
green
salads
and
two
little
wooden
tubs
with
herrings
and
anchovies
henslowe
stopped
her
as
she
was
going
saying
rien
de
plus
the
waitress
contemplated
the
array
with
a
tragic
air
her
arms
folded
over
her
ample
bosom
que
monsieur
the
greatest
fake
about
all
this
war
business
is
the
peace
i
tell
you
not
till
the
hors
has
been
restored
to
its
proper
abundance
and
variety
will
i
admit
that
the
war
the
waitress
tittered
things
are
what
they
used
to
be
she
said
going
back
to
the
kitchen
heineman
burst
into
the
restaurant
at
that
moment
slamming
the
door
behind
him
so
that
the
glass
rang
and
the
fat
woman
and
the
hairy
man
started
violently
in
their
chairs
he
tumbled
into
a
place
grinning
broadly
and
what
have
you
done
to
walters
heineman
wiped
his
glasses
meticulously
oh
he
died
of
drinking
raspberry
shrub
he
said
peteet
du
ving
de
bourgogne
he
shouted
towards
the
waitress
in
his
nasal
french
then
he
added
le
guy
is
coming
in
a
minute
i
just
met
the
restaurant
was
gradually
filling
up
with
men
and
women
of
very
various
costumes
with
a
good
sprinkling
of
americans
in
uniform
and
out
god
i
hate
people

drink
cried
heineman
pouring
out
wine
a
man
who
do
drink
just
cumbers

how

it
in

et

andrews
he
continued
getting
up
ceremoniously
a
little
man
with
twirled
mustaches
and
a
small
vandyke
beard
sat
down
at
the
fourth
place
he
had
a
faintly
red
nose
and
little
twinkling
eyes
how
glad
i
am
he
said
exposing
his
starched
cuffs
with
a
curious
gesture
to
have
some
one
to
dine
with
when
one
begins
to
get
old
loneliness
is
impossible
it
is
only
youth
that
dares
think
afterwards
one
has
only
one
thing
to
think
about
old
there
always
work
said
andrews
slavery
any
work
is
slavery
what
is
the
use
of
freeing
your
intellect
if
you
sell
yourself
again
to
the
first
bidder
rot
said
heineman
pouring
out
from
a
new
bottle
andrews
had
begun
to
notice
the
girl
who
sat
at
the
next
table
in
front
of
a
pale
young
soldier
in
who
resembled
her
extraordinarily
she
had
high
cheek
bones
and
a
forehead
in
which
the
modelling
of
the
skull
showed
through
the
transparent
skin
her
heavy
chestnut
hair
was
coiled
carelessly
at
the
back
of
her
head
she
spoke
very
quietly
and
pressed
her
lips
together
when
she
smiled
she
ate
quickly
and
neatly
like
a
cat
the
restaurant
had
gradually
filled
up
with
people
the
waitress
and
the
patron
a
fat
man
with
a
wide
red
sash
coiled
tightly
round
his
waist
moved
with
difficulty
among
the
crowded
tables
a
woman
at
a
table
in
the
corner
with
dead
white
skin
and
drugged
staring
eyes
kept
laughing
hoarsely
leaning
her
head
in
a
hat
with
bedraggled
white
plumes
against
the
wall
there
was
a
constant
jingle
of
plates
and
glasses
and
an
oily
fume
of
food
and
women
clothes
and
wine
want
to
know
what
i
really
did
with
your
friend
said
heineman
leaning
towards
andrews
i
hope
you
did
push
him
into
the
it
was
damn
impolite
but
hell
it
was
damn
impolite
of
him
not
to
drink
no
use
wasting
time
with
a
man
who
do
drink
i
took
him
into
a
cafe
and
asked
him
to
wait
while
i
telephoned
i
guess
he
still
waiting
one
of
the
whoreiest
cafes
on
the
whole
boulevard
heineman
laughed
uproariously
and
started
explaining
it
in
nasal
french
to
le
guy
andrews
flushed
with
annoyance
for
a
moment
but
soon
started
laughing
heineman
had
started
singing
again
o
sinbad

in

trinidad
and
twice

all
around
everybody
clapped
the
woman
in
the
corner
cried
bravo
bravo
in
a
shrill
nightmare
voice
heineman
bowed
his
big
grinning
face
bobbing
up
and
down
like
the
face
of
a
chinese
figure
in
porcelain
lui
est
sinbad
he
cried
pointing
with
a
wide
gesture
towards
henslowe
give
some
more
heinz
give
them

said
henslowe
laughing
big
brunettes
with
long
stelets
on
the
shores
of
italee
dutch
girls
with
golden
curls
beside
the
zuyder
zee
everybody
cheered
again
andrews
kept
looking
at
the
girl
at
the
next
table
whose
face
was
red
from
laughter
she
had
a
handkerchief
pressed
to
her
mouth
and
kept
saying
in
a
low
voice
o
est
drole
o

heineman
picked
up
a
glass
and
waved
it
in
the
air
before
drinking
it
off
several
people
got
up
and
filled
it
up
from
their
bottles
with
white
wine
and
red
the
french
soldier
at
the
next
table
pulled
an
army
canteen
from
under
his
chair
and
hung
it
round
heineman
neck
heineman
his
face
crimson
bowed
to
all
sides
more
like
a
chinese
porcelain
figure
than
ever
and
started
singing
in
all
solemnity
this
time
hulas
and
hulas
would
pucker
up
their
lips
he
fell
for
their
hips
for
they
were
pips
his
chunky
body
swayed
to
the
ragtime
the
woman
in
the
corner
kept
time
with
long
white
arms
raised
above
her
head
bet
she
a
snake
charmer
said
henslowe
o

wild
o
sinbad

in

all
around
heineman
waved
his
arms
pointed
again
to
henslowe
and
sank
into
his
chair
saying
in
the
tones
of
a
shakespearean
actor
lui
the
girl
hid
her
face
on
the
tablecloth
shaken
with
laughter
andrews
could
hear
a
convulsed
little
voice
saying
o
est
rigolo
heineman
took
off
the
canteen
and
handed
it
back
to
the
french
soldier
merci
camarade
he
said
solemnly
eh
bien
jeanne
temps
de
ficher
le

said
the
french
soldier
to
the
girl
they
got
up
he
shook
hands
with
the
americans
andrews
caught
the
girl
eye
and
they
both
started
laughing
convulsively
again
andrews
noticed
how
erect
and
supple
she
walked
as
his
eyes
followed
her
to
the
door
andrews
party
followed
soon
after
we
got

hurry
if

lapin
agile

henslowe
in
a
loud
stage
whisper
in
andrews
ear
they

a
lion
cub
named
our
first
born
said
heineman
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
the
streets
were
deserted
a
thin
ray
of
moonlight
bursting
now
and
then
through
the
heavy
clouds
lit
up
low
houses
and
streets
and
the
flights
of
steps
with
rare
dim
lamps
bracketed
in
house
walls
that
led
up
to
the
butte
there
was
a
gendarme
in
front
of
the
door
of
the
lapin
agile
the
street
was
still
full
of
groups
that
had
just
come
out
american
officers
and
women
with
a
sprinkling
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
region

heineman
in

they
climbed
further
up
the
hill
there
was
a
scent
of
wet
gardens
in
the
air
entirely
silent
except
for
the
clatter
of
their
feet
on
the
cobbles
heineman
was
dancing
a
sort
of
a
jig
at
the
head
of
the
procession
they
stopped
before
a
tall
cadaverous
house
and
started
climbing
a
rickety
wooden
stairway
talk
about

dope
i
got
this
from
a
man
who
actually
in

could
be

climbed
the
dark
stairs
ahead
of
them
shut
up
they
stumbled
over
a
raised
doorstep
into
a
large
garret
room
with
a
tile
floor
where
a
tall
lean
man
in
a
dressing
gown
of
some
brown
material
received
them
the
only
candle
made
all
their
shadows
dance
fantastically
on
the
slanting
white
walls
as
they
moved
about
one
side
of
the
room
had
three
big
windows
with
an
occasional
cracked
pane
mended
with
newspaper
stretching
from
floor
to
ceiling
in
front
of
them
were
two
couches
with
rugs
piled
on
them
on
the
opposite
wall

a
confused
mass
of
canvases

one
against

slanting
wall
of
the
room
le

a
table
out
of

heavy
glasses
on
it
and

a
drawer
of
the

and
lighting

andrews
saw
that
his
feet
and
legs
were
bare
below
the
frayed
edge
of
the
dressing
gown
the
candle
light
lit
up
the
flushed
faces
and
the
crude
banana
yellows
and
arsenic
greens
of
the
canvases
along
the
walls
against
which
jars

minute
making
peace
with
a
goddam
outrage
cried
heineman
knocking
a
bottle
off

lanky

pieces
patiently
without
comment

swear

aubrey
the
old

the
first
great
gesture
towards
a
newer
and
better
world
there
is
no
alternative
the
chance

never

it
is
either

step
courageously
forward
or
sink
into
unbelievable
horrors
of
anarchy
and
civil
war
peace
or
the
dark
ages
andrews
had
felt
for
some
time
an
uncontrollable
sleepiness
coming
over
him
he
rolled
himself
on
a
rug
and
stretched
out
on
the
empty
couch
the
voices
arguing
wrangling
enunciating
emphatic
phrases
dinned
for
a
minute
in
his
ears
he
went
to
sleep
when
andrews
woke
up
he
found
himself
staring
at
the
cracked
plaster
of
an
unfamiliar
ceiling
for
some
moments
he
could
not
guess
where
he
was
henslowe
was
sleeping
wrapped
in
another
rug
on
the
couch
beside
him
except
for
henslowe
breathing
there
was
complete
silence
floods
of
light
poured
in
through
the
wide
windows
behind
which
andrews
could
see
a
sky
full
of
bright
clouds
he
sat
up
carefully
some
time
in
the
night
he
must
have
taken
off
his
tunic
and
boots
and
puttees
which
were
on
the
floor
beside
the
couch
the
tables
with
the
bottles
had
gone
and
the
lanky
man
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
andrews
went
to
the
window
in
his
stockinged
feet
paris
way
a
and
lay
spread
out
like
a
turkish
carpet
with
a
silvery
band
of
mist
where
the
river
was
out
of
which
the
eiffel
tower
stood
up
like
a
man
wading
here
and
there
blue
smoke
and
brown
spiralled
up
to
lose
itself
in
the
faint
canopy
of
brown
fog
that
hung
high
above
the
houses
andrews
stood
a
long
while
leaning
against
the
window
frame
until
he
heard
henslowe
voice
behind
him
depuis
le
jour
ou
je
me
suis
you
look
like
andrews
turned
round
henslowe
was
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
with
his
hair
in
disorder
combing
his
little
silky
mustache
with
a
pocket
comb
gee
i
have
a
head
he
said
my
tongue
feels
like
a
nutmeg
grater
does
yours
no
i
feel
like
a
fighting
what
do
you
say
we
go
down
to
the
seine
and
have
a
bath
in
benny
franklin
bathtub
where
that
it
sounds
then
we
have
the
biggest
breakfast
that
the
right
spirit
where
everybody
gone
to
old
heinz
has
gone
to
his
moki
i
guess
and
aubrey
gone
to
collect
more
dope
at
the
crillon
he
says
four
in
the
morning
when
the
drunks
come
home
is
the
prime
time
for
a
newspaper
and
the
monkish
man
search
the
streets
were
full
of
men
and
girls
hurrying
to
work
everything
sparkled
had
an
air
of
being
just
scrubbed
they
passed
bakeries
from
which
came
a
rich
smell
of
bread
from
cafes
came
whiffs
of
roasting
coffee
they
crossed
through
the
markets
that
were
full
of
heavy
carts
lumbering
to
and
fro
and
women
with
net
bags
full
of
vegetables
there
was
a
pungent
scent
of
crushed
cabbage
leaves
and
carrots
and
wet
clay
the
mist
was
raw
and
biting
along
the
quais
and
made
the
blood
come
into
their
cheeks
and
their
hands
stiff
with
cold
the
bathhouse
was
a
huge
barge
with
a
house
built
on
it
in
a
lozenge
shape
they
crossed
to
it
by
a
little
gangplank
on
which
were
a
few
geraniums
in
pots
the
attendant
gave
them
two
rooms
side
by
side
on
the
lower
deck
painted
grey
with
steamed
over
windows
through
which
andrews
caught
glimpses
of
hurrying
green
water
he
stripped
his
clothes
off
quickly
the
tub
was
of
copper
varnished
with
some
white
metal
inside
the
water
flowed
in
through
two
copper
swans
necks
when
andrews
stepped
into
the
hot
green
water
a
little
window
in
the
partition
flew
open
and
henslowe
shouted
in
to
him
talk
about
modern
conveniences
you
can
converse
while
you
bathe
andrews
scrubbed
himself
jauntily
with
a
square
piece
of
pink
soap
splashing
the
water
about
like
a
small
boy
he
stood
up
and
lathered
himself
all
over
and
then
let
himself
slide
into
the
water
which
splashed
out
over
the
floor
do
you
think
you
a
performing
seal
shouted
henslowe
it
all
so
preposterous
cried
andrews
going
off
into
convulsions
of
laughter
she
has
a
lion
cub
named
bubu
and
nicolas
romanoff
lives
in
the
ritz
and
the
revolution
is
scheduled
for
day
after
tomorrow
at
twelve
i
put
it
about
the
first
of
may
answered
henslowe
amid
a
sound
of
splashing
gee
it
be
great
to
be
a
people
commissary
you
could
go
and
revolute
the
grand
llama
of
o
it
too
deliciously
preposterous
cried
andrews
letting
himself
slide
a
second
time
into
the
bathtub
ii
two
passed
outside
the
window
andrews
watched
the
yellow
pigskin
revolver
cases
until
they
were
out
of
sight
he
felt
joyfully
secure
from
them
the
waiter
standing
by
the
door
with
a
napkin
on
his
arm
gave
him
a
sense
of
security
so
intense
it
made
him
laugh
on
the
marble
table
before
him
were
a
small
glass
of
beer
a
notebook
full
of
ruled
sheets
of
paper
and
a
couple
of
yellow
pencils
the
beer
the
color
of
topaz
in
the
clear
grey
light
that
streamed
in
through
the
window
threw
a
pale
yellow
glow
with
a
bright
center
on
the
table
outside
was
the
boulevard
with
a
few
people
walking
hurriedly
an
empty
market
wagon
passed
now
and
then
rumbling
loud
on
a
bench
a
woman
in
a
black
knitted
shawl
with
a
bundle
of
newspapers
in
her
knees
was
counting
sous
with
loving
concentration
andrews
looked
at
his
watch
he
had
an
hour
before
going
to
the
schola
cantorum
he
got
to
his
feet
paid
the
waiter
and
strolled
down
the
center
of
the
boulevard
thinking
smilingly
of
pages
he
had
written
of
pages
he
was
going
to
write
filled
with
a
sense
of
leisurely
it
was
a
grey
morning
with
a
little
yellowish
fog
in
the
air
the
pavements
were
damp
reflected
women
dresses
and
men
legs
and
the
angular
outlines
of
taxicabs
from
a
flower
stand
with
violets
and
red
and
pink
carnations
irregular
blotches
of
color
ran
down
into
the
brownish
grey
of
the
pavement
andrews
caught
a
faint
smell
of
violets
in
the
smell
of
the
fog
as
he
passed
the
flower
stand
and
remembered
suddenly
that
spring
was
coming
he
would
not
miss
a
moment
of
this
spring
he
told
himself
he
would
follow
it
step
by
step
from
the
first
violets
oh
how
fully
he
must
live
now
to
make
up
for
all
the
years
he
had
wasted
in
his
life
he
kept
on
walking
along
the
boulevard
he
was
remembering
how
he
and
the
girl
the
soldier
had
called
jeanne
had
both
kindled
with
uncontrollable
laughter
when
their
eyes
had
met
that
night
in
the
restaurant
he
wished
he
could
go
down
the
boulevard
with
a
girl
like
that
laughing
through
the
foggy
morning
he
wondered
vaguely
what
part
of
paris
he
was
getting
to
but
was
too
happy
to
care
how
beautifully
long
the
hours
were
in
the
early
morning
at
a
concert
at
the
salle
gaveau
the
day
before
he
had
heard
nocturnes
and
les
sirenes
rhythms
from
them
were
the
warp
of
all
his
thoughts
against
the
background
of
the
grey
street
and
the
brownish
fog
that
hung
a
veil
at
the
end
of
every
vista
he
began
to
imagine
rhythms
of
his
own
modulations
and
phrases
that
grew
brilliant
and
faded
that
flapped
for
a
while
like
gaudy
banners
above
his
head
through
the
clatter
of
the
street
he
noticed
that
he
was
passing
a
long
building
with
blank
rows
of
windows
at
the
central
door
of
which
stood
groups
of
american
soldiers
smoking
unconsciously
he
hastened
his
steps
for
fear
of
meeting
an
officer
he
would
have
to
salute
he
passed
the
men
without
looking
at
them
a
voice
detained
him
say
when
he
turned
he
saw
that
a
short
man
with
curly
hair
whose
face
though
familiar
he
could
not
place
had
left
the
group
at
the
door
and
was
coming
towards
him
hello

shook

to

wore
stained
breeches
and
badly
rolled
puttees
his
shirt
was
open
at
the
neck
from
his
blue
denim
jacket
came
a
smell
of
stale
grease
that
andrews
recognised
the
smell
of
army
kitchens
he
had
a
momentary
recollection
of
standing
in
line
cold
dark
mornings
and
of
the
sound
the
food
made
slopping
into
mess
kits

after
a
pause
in
a
constrained
voice

were
leaning
against
the
dusty
house
wall
andrews
looked
at
his
feet
the
mud
of
the
pavement
splashing
up
on
the
wall
made
an
even
dado
along
the
bottom
on
which
andrews
scraped
the
toe
of
his
shoe
up
and
down
well
how
everything

caught
a
glimpse
of
a
white
face
her
hips
trembled
like
jelly
under
the
blue
skirt
with
each
hard
clack
of
her
high
heels
on
the
pavement

different
voice

permanent

so
long
so
long
fuselli
turned
and
slouched
back
to
the
group
of
men
at
the
door
andrews
hurried
away
as
he
turned
the
corner
he
had
a
glimpse
of
fuselli
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
legs
crossed
leaning
against
the
wall
behind
the
door
of
the
barracks
iii
the
darkness
where
the
rain
fell
through
the
vague
halos
of
light
round
the
street
lamps
glittered
with
streaks
of
pale
gold
andrews
ears
were
full
of
the
sound
of
racing
gutters
and
spattering
waterspouts
and
of
the
hard
unceasing
beat
of
the
rain
on
the
pavements
it
was
after
closing
time
the
corrugated
shutters
were
drawn
down
in
front
of
cafe
windows
andrews
cap
was
wet
water
trickled
down
his
forehead
and
the
sides
of
his
nose
running
into
his
eyes
his
feet
were
soaked
and
he
could
feel
the
wet
patches
growing
on
his
knees
where
they
received
the
water
running
off
his
overcoat
the
street
stretched
wide
and
dark
ahead
of
him
with
an
occasional
glimmer
of
greenish
reflection
from
a
lamp
as
he
walked
splashing
with
long
strides
through
the
rain
he
noticed
that
he
was
keeping
pace
with
a
woman
under
an
umbrella
a
slender
person
who
was
hurrying
with
small
resolute
steps
up
the
boulevard
when
he
saw
her
a
mad
hope
flamed
suddenly
through
him
he
remembered
a
vulgar
little
theatre
and
the
crude
light
of
a
spot
light
through
the
paint
and
powder
a
girl
skin
had
shone
with
a
firm
brilliance
that
made
him
think
of
wide
uplands
and
dancing
figures
on
greek
vases
since
he
had
seen
her
two
nights
ago
he
had
thought
of
nothing
else
he
had
feverishly
found
out
her
name
naya
selikoff
a
mad
hope
flared
through
him
that
this
girl
he
was
walking
beside
was
the
girl
whose
slender
limbs
moved
in
an
endless
frieze
through
his
thoughts
he
peered
at
her
with
eyes
blurred
with
rain
what
an
ass
he
was
of
course
it
could
be
it
was
too
early
she
was
on
the
stage
at
this
minute
other
hungry
eyes
were
staring
at
her
slenderness
other
hands
were
twitching
to
stroke
her
skin
walking
under
the
steady
downpour
that
stung
his
face
and
ears
and
sent
a
tiny
cold
trickle
down
his
back
he
felt
a
sudden
dizziness
of
desire
come
over
him
his
hands
thrust
to
the
bottom
of
his
coat
pockets
clutched
convulsively
he
felt
that
he
would
die
that
his
pounding
blood
vessels
would
burst
the
bead
curtains
of
rain
rustled
and
tinkled
about
him
awakening
his
nerves
making
his
skin
flash
and
tingle
in
the
gurgle
of
water
in
gutters
and
water
spouts
he
could
imagine
he
heard
orchestras
droning
libidinous
music
the
feverish
excitement
of
his
senses
began
to
create
frenzied
rhythms
in
his
ears
o
ce
pauvre
poilu
doit
etre
mouille
said
a
small
tremulous
voice
beside
him
he
turned
the
girl
was
offering
him
part
of
her
umbrella
o
un
americain
she
said
again
still
speaking
as
if
to
herself
mais
ca
ne
vaut
pas
la
mais
oui
mais
he
stepped
under
the
umbrella
beside
her
but
you
must
let
me
hold
as
he
took
the
umbrella
he
caught
her
eye
he

splashed
a
great
wave
of
mud
over

clutched

laughter

seethe
of
the
rain
and
the
tumultuous
gurgle
of

and
tired
when

no

in
his
pocket

from

and
white

dazzled
him
he
blinked
his
eyes
the
lashes
were
still
full
of
raindrops
when
he
had
lit
a
candle
and
set
it
amongst
the
music

table

said
andrews
sulkily
john
andrews
sat
at
a
table
outside
the
cafe
de
rohan
the
sun
had
just
set
on
a
ruddy
afternoon
flooding
everything
with
light
and
cold
greenish
shadow
the
sky
was
bright
lilac
color
streaked
with
a
few
amber
clouds
the
lights
were
on
in
all
the
windows
of
the
magazin
du
louvre
opposite
so
that
the
windows
seemed
bits
of
polished
glass
in
the
afterglow
in
the
colonnade
of
the
palais
royal
the
shadows
were
deepening
and
growing
colder
a
steady
stream
of
people
poured
in
and
out
of
the
metro
green
buses
stuffed
with
people
kept
passing
the
roar
of
the
traffic
and
the
clatter
of
footsteps
and
the
grumble
of
voices
swirled
like
dance
music
about
andrews
head
he
noticed
all
at
once
that
the
rabbit
man
stood
in
front
of
him
a
rabbit
dangling
forgotten
at
the
end
of
its
rubber
tube
et
ca
va
bien
le
commerce
said
andrews
quietly
quietly
said
the
rabbit
man
distractedly
making
the
rabbit
turn
a
somersault
at
his
feet
andrews
watched
the
people
going
into
the
metro
the
gentleman
amuses
himself
in
paris
asked
the
rabbit
man
timidly
oh
yes
and
you
quietly
the
rabbit
man
smiled
women
are
very
beautiful
at
this
hour
of
the
evening
he
said
again
in
his
very
timid
tone
there
is
nothing
more
beautiful
than
this
moment
of
the
evening
in
or
parisian
the
eyes
of
the
rabbit
man
glittered
excuse
me
sir

went
on
i
must
try
and
sell
some
au
revoir
said
andrews
holding
out
his
hand
the
rabbit
man
shook
it
with
sudden
vigor
and
went
off
making
a
rabbit
hop
before
him
along
the
curbstone
he
was
hidden
by
the
swiftly
moving
crowds
in
the
square
flaring
violet
arclights
were
flickering
on
lighting
up
their
globes
that
hung
like
harsh
moons
above
the
pavement

so
long
andrews
sat
a
while
more
at
the
table
outside
the
cafe
a
cold
wind
was
blowing
the
sky
was
and
the
ashen
white
arc
lamps
cast
a
mortuary
light
over
everything
in
the
colonnade
of
the
palais
royal
the
shadows
were
harsh
and
inky
in
the
square
the
people
were
gradually
thinning
the
lights
in
the
magazin
du
louvre
had
gone
out
from
the
cafe
behind
him
a
faint
smell
of
food
began
to
saturate
the
cold
air
of
the
street
then
he
saw
jeanne
advancing
across
the
pavement
of
the
square
slim
and
black
under
the
arc
lights
he
ran
to
meet
her
the
cylindrical
stove
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
roared
softly
in
front
of
it
the
white
cat
was
rolled
into
a
fluffy
ball
in
which
ears
and
nose
made
tiny
splashes
of
pink
like
those
at
the
tips
of
the
petals
of
certain
white
roses
one
side
of
the
stove
at
the
table
against
the
window
sat
an
old
brown
man
with
a
bright
red
stain
on
each
cheek
bone
who
wore
formless
corduroy
clothes
the
color
of
his
skin
holding
the
small
spoon
in
a
knotted
hand
he
was
stirring
slowly
and
continuously
a
liquid
that
was
yellow
and
steamed
in
a
glass
behind
him
was
the
window
with
sleet
beating
against
it
in
the
leaden
light
of
a
wintry
afternoon
the
other
side
of
the
stove
was
a
zinc
bar
with
yellow
bottles
and
green
bottles
and
a
water
spigot
with
a
neck
like
a
giraffe
that
rose
out
of
the
bar
beside
a
varnished
wood
pillar
that
made
the
decoration
of
the
corner
with
a
terra
cotta
pot
of
ferns
on
top
of
it
from
where
andrews
sat
on
the
padded
bench
at
the
back
of
the
room
the
fern
fronds
made
a
black
lacework
against
the
lefthand
side
of
the
window
while
against
the
other
was
the
brown
silhouette
of
the
old
man
head
and
the
slant
of
his
cap
the
stove
hid
the
door
and
the
white
cat
round
and
symmetrical
formed
the
center
of
the
visible
universe
on
the
marble
table
beside
andrews
were
some
pieces
of
crisp
bread
with
butter
on
them
a
saucer
of
damson
jam
and
a
bowl
with
coffee
and
hot
milk
from
which
the
steam
rose
in
a
faint
spiral
his
tunic
was
unbuttoned
and
he
rested
his
head
on
his
two
hands
staring
through
his
fingers
at
a
thick
pile
of
ruled
paper
full
of
hastily
drawn
signs
some
in
ink
and
some
in
pencil
where
now
and
then
he
made
a
mark
with
a
pencil
at
the
other
edge
of
the
pile
of
papers
were
two
books
one
yellow
and
one
white
with
coffee
stains
on
it
the
fire
roared
and
the
cat
slept
and
the
old
brown
man
stirred
and
stirred
rarely
stopping
for
a
moment
to
lift
the
glass
to
his
lips
occasionally
the
scratching
of
sleet
upon
the
windows
became
audible
or
there
was
a
distant
sound
of
dish
pans
through
the
door
in
the
back
the
clock
that
hung
above
the
mirror
that
backed
the
bar
jerked
out
one
jingly
strike
a
half
hour
andrews
did
not
look
up
the
cat
still
slept
in
front
of
the
stove
which
roared
with
a
gentle
singsong
the
old
brown
man
still
stirred
the
yellow
liquid
in
his
glass
the
clock
was
ticking
uphill
towards
the
hour
andrews
hands
were
cold
there
was
a
nervous
flutter
in
his
wrists
and
in
his
chest
inside
of
him
was
a
great
rift
of
light
infinitely
vast
and
infinitely
distant
through
it
sounds
poured
from
somewhere
so
that
he
trembled
with
them
to
his
finger
tips
sounds
modulated
into
rhythms
that
washed
back
and
forth
and
crossed
each
other
like
sea
waves
in
a
cove
sounds
clotted
into
harmonies
behind
everything
the
queen
of
sheba
out
of
flaubert
held
her
fantastic
hand
with
its
long
gilded
finger
nails
on
his
shoulder
and
he
was
leaning
forward
over
the
brink
of
life
but
the
image
was
vague
like
a
shadow
cast
on
the
brilliance
of
his
mind
the
clock
struck
four
the
white
fluffy
ball
of
the
cat
unrolled
very
slowly
its
eyes
were
very
round
and
yellow
it
put
first
one
leg
and
then
the
other
out
before
it
on
the
tiled
floor
spreading
wide
the
claws
its
tail
rose
up
behind
it
straight
as
the
mast
of
a
ship
with
slow
processional
steps
the
cat
walked
towards
the
door
the
old
brown
man
drank
down
the
yellow
liquid
and
smacked
his
lips
twice
loudly
meditatively
andrews
raised
his
head
his
blue
eyes
looking
straight
before
him
without
seeing
anything
dropping
the
pencil
he
leaned
back
against
the
wall
and
stretched
his
arms
out
taking
the
coffee
bowl
between
his
two
hands
he
drank
s
little
it
was
cold
he
piled
some
jam
on
a
piece
of
bread
and
ate
it
licking
a
little
off
his
fingers
afterwards
then
he
looked
towards
the
old
brown
man
and
said
on
est
bien
ici
ce
pas
monsieur
morue
oui
on
est
bien
ici
said
the
old
brown
man
in
a
voice
so
gruff
it
seemed
to
rattle
very
slowly
he
got
to
his
feet
good
i
am
going
to
the
barge
he
said
then
he
called
chipette
oui
a
little
girl
in
a
black
apron
with
her
hair
in
two
tight
pigtails
that
stood
out
behind
her
tiny
bullet
head
as
she
ran
came
through
the
door
from
the
back
part
of
the
house
there
give
that
to
your
mother
said
the
old
brown
man
putting
some
coppers
in
her
hand
oui
you
better
stay
here
where
it
warm
said
andrews
yawning
i
have
to
work
it
only
soldiers
do
have
to
work
rattled
the
old
brown
man
when
the
door
opened
a
gust
of
raw
air
circled
about
the
wine
shop
and
a
roar
of
wind
and
hiss
of
sleet
came
from
the
quai
outside
the
cat
took
refuge
beside
the
stove
with
its
back
up
and
its
tail
waving
the
door
closed
and
the
old
brown
man
silhouette
slanted
against
the
wind
crossed
the
grey
oblong
of
the
window
andrews
settled
down
to
work
again
but
you
work
a
lot
a
lot
do
you
jean
said
chipette
putting
her
chin
on
the
table
beside
the
books
and
looking
up
into
his
eyes
with
little
eyes
like
black
beads
i
wonder
if
i
when
i
grown
up
i
sha
work
a
bit
i
drive
round
in
a
andrews
laughed
chipette
looked
at
him
for
a
minute
and
then
went
into
the
other
room
carrying
away
the
empty
coffee
bowl
in
front
of
the
stove
the
cat
sat
on
its
haunches
licking
a
paw
rhythmically
with
a
pink
curling
tongue
like
a
rose
petal
andrews
whistled
a
few
bars
staring
at
the
cat
what
think
of
that
minet
that
la
reine
de
saba
la
reine
de
the
cat
curled
into
a
ball
again
with
great
deliberation
and
went
to
sleep
andrews
began
thinking
of
jeanne
and
the
thought
gave
him
a
sense
of
quiet
strolling
with
her
in
the
evening
through
the
streets
full
of
men
and
women
walking
significantly
together
sent
a
languid
calm
through
his
jangling
nerves
which
he
had
never
known
in
his
life
before
it
excited
him
to
be
with
her
but
very
suavely
so
that
he
forgot
that
his
limbs
were
swathed
stiffly
in
an
uncomfortable
uniform
so
that
his
feverish
desire
seemed
to
fly
out
of
him
until
with
her
body
beside
him
he
seemed
to
drift
effortlessly
in
the
stream
of
the
lives
of
all
the
people
he
passed
so
languid
from
the
quiet
loves
that
streamed
up
about
him
that
the
hard
walls
of
his
personality
seemed
to
have
melted
entirely
into
the
mistiness
of
twilight
streets
and
for
a
moment
as
he
thought
of
it
a
scent
of
flowers
heavy
with
pollen
and
sprouting
grass
and
damp
moss
and
swelling
sap
seemed
to
tingle
in
his
nostrils
sometimes
swimming
in
the
ocean
on
a
rough
day
he
had
felt
that
same
reckless
exhilaration
when
towards
the
shore
a
huge
seething
wave
had
caught
him
up
and
sped
him
forward
on
its
crest
sitting
quietly
in
the
empty
wine
shop
that
grey
afternoon
he
felt
his
blood
grumble
and
swell
in
his
veins
as
the
new
life
was
grumbling
and
swelling
in
the
sticky
buds
of
the
trees
in
the
tender
green
quick
under
their
rough
bark
in
the
little
furry
animals
of
the
woods
and
in
the
cattle
that
tramped
into
mud
the
lush
meadows
in
the
premonition
of
spring
was
a
resistless
wave
of
force
that
carried
him
and
all
of
them
with
it
tumultuously
the
clock
struck
five
andrews
jumped
to
his
feet
and
still
struggling
into
his
overcoat
darted
out
of
the
door
a
raw
wind
blew
on
the
square
the
river
was
a
muddy
swollen
and
rapid
a
hoarse
triumphant
roaring
came
from
it
the
sleet
had
stopped
but
the
pavements
were
covered
with
slush
and
in
the
gutters
were
large
puddles
which
the
wind
ruffled
everything
houses
bridges
river
and
sky
was
in
shades
of
cold
broken
by
one
jagged
rift
across
the
sky
against
which
the
bulk
of
notre
dame
and
the
slender
spire
of
the
crossing
rose
dark
and
purplish
andrews
walked
with
long
strides
splashing
through
the
puddles
until
opposite
the
low
building
of
the
morgue
he
caught
a
crowded
green
bus
outside
the
hotel
crillon
were
many
limousines
painted
with
numbers
in
white
letters
on
the
doors
the
drivers
men
with
their
coat
collars
turned
up
round
their
red
faces
stood
in
groups
under
the
portico
andrews
passed
the
sentry
and
went
through
the
revolving
doors
into
the
lobby
which
was
vividly
familiar
it
had
the
smell
he
remembered
having
smelt
in
the
lobbies
of
new
york
hotels
a
smell
of
cigar
smoke
and
furniture
polish
on
one
side
a
door
led
to
a
big
dining
room
where
many
men
and
women
were
having
tea
from
which
came
a
smell
of
pastry
and
rich
food
on
the
expanse
of
red
carpet
in
front
of
him
officers
and
civilians
stood
in
groups
talking
in
low
voices
there
was
a
sound
of
jingling
spurs
and
jingling
dishes
from
the
restaurant
and
near
where
andrews
stood
shifting
his
weight
from
one
foot
to
the
other
sprawled
in
a
leather
chair
a
fat
man
with
a
black
felt
hat
over
his
eyes
and
a
large
watch
chain
dangling
limply
over
his
bulbous
paunch
he
cleared
his
throat
occasionally
with
a
rasping
noise
and
spat
loudly
into
the
spittoon
beside
him
at
last
andrews
caught
sight
of
aubrey
who
was
dapper
with
white
cheeks
and
tortoise
shell
glasses
come
along
he
said
seizing
andrews
by
the
arm
you
are
then
he
went
on
whispering
in
andrews
ear
as
they
went
out
through
the
revolving
doors
great
things
happened
in
the
conference
today
i
can
tell
you
that
old
they
crossed
the
bridge
towards
the
portico
of
the
chamber
of
deputies
with
its
high
pediment
and
its
grey
columns
down
the
river
they
could
see
faintly
the
eiffel
tower
with
a
drift
of
mist
athwart
it
like
a
section
of
spider
web
spun
between
the
city
and
the
clouds
do
we
have
to
go
to
see
these
people
aubrey
yes
you
ca
back
out
now
genevieve
rod
wants
to
know
about
american
but
what
on
earth
can
i
tell
her
about
american
music
was
there
a
man
named
macdowell
who
went
mad
or
something
andrews
laughed
but
you
know
i
have
any
social
graces
i
suppose
i
have
to
say
i
think
foch
is
a
little
tin
you
need
say
anything
if
you
do
want
to
they
very
advanced
oh
rats
they
were
going
up
a
stair
that
had
engravings
on
the
landings
where
there
was
a
faint
smell
of
stale
food
and
dustpans
at
the
top
landing
aubrey
rang
the
bell
at
a
varnished
door
in
a
moment
a
girl
opened
it
she
had
a
cigarette
in
her
hand
her
face
was
pale
under
a
mass
of
hair
her
eyes
very
large
a
pale
brown
as
large
as
the
eyes
of
women
in
those
paintings
of
artemisias
and
berenikes
found
in
tombs
in
the
fayum
she
wore
a
plain
black
dress
enfin
she
said
and
held
out
her
hand
to
aubrey
there
my
friend
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
absently
still
looking
at
aubrey
does
he
speak
french
good
this
they
went
into
a
large
room
with
a
piano
where
an
elderly
woman
with
grey
hair
and
yellow
teeth
and
the
same
large
eyes
as
her
daughter
stood
before
the
fireplace
maman
enfin
ils
arrivent
ces
genevieve
was
afraid
you
were
coming
mme
rod
said
to
andrews
smiling
monsieur
aubrey
gave
us
such
a
picture
of
your
playing
that
we
have
been
excited
all
day
we
adore
i
wish
i
could
do
something
more
to
the
point
with
it
than
adore
it
said
genevieve
rod
hastily
then
she
went
on
with
a
laugh
but
i
forget
monsieur
andreffs
monsieur
she
made
a
gesture
with
her
hand
from
andrews
to
a
young
frenchman
in
a
coat
with
small
mustaches
and
a
very
tight
vest
who
bowed
towards
andrews
now
we
have
tea
said
genevieve
rod
everybody
talks
sense
until
they
had
tea
it
only
after
tea
that
anyone
is
ever
she
pulled
open
some
curtains
that
covered
the
door
into
the
adjoining
room
i
understand
why
sarah
bernhardt
is
so
fond
of
curtains
she
said
they
give
an
air
of
drama
to
existence
there
is
nothing
more
heroic
than
she
sat
at
the
head
of
an
oak
table
where
were
china
platters
with
pastries
an
old
pewter
kettle
under
which
an
alcohol
lamp
burned
a
dresden
china
teapot
in
pale
yellows
and
greens
and
cups
and
saucers
and
plates
with
a
eagle
design
in
dull
vermilion
tout
ca
said
genevieve
waving
her
hand
across
the
table
boche
but
we
have
any
others
so
they
have
to
the
older
woman
who
sat
beside
her
whispered
something
in
her
ear
and
laughed
genevieve
put
on
a
pair
of
spectacles
and
starting
pouring
out
tea
debussy
once
drank
out
of
that
cup
it
cracked
she
said
handing
a
cup
to
john
andrews
do
you
know
anything
of
you
can
play
to
us
after
tea
i
ca
play
anything
any
more
ask
me
three
months
from
oh
yes
but
nobody
expects
you
to
do
any
tricks
with
it
you
can
certainly
make
it
intelligible
that
all
i
i
have
my
andrews
sipped
his
tea
slowly
looking
now
and
then
at
genevieve
rod
who
had
suddenly
begun
talking
very
fast
to
ronsard
she
held
a
cigarette
between
the
fingers
of
a
long
thin
hand
her
large
eyes
kept
their
startled
look
of
having
just
opened
on
the
world
a
little
smile
appeared
and
disappeared
maliciously
in
the
curve
of
her
cheek
away
from
her
small
firm
lips
the
older
woman
beside
her
kept
looking
round
the
table
with
a
jolly
air
of
hospitality
and
showing
her
yellow
teeth
in
a
smile
afterwards
they
went
back
to
the
sitting
room
and
andrews
sat
down
at
the
piano
the
girl
sat
very
straight
on
a
little
chair
beside
the
piano
andrews
ran
his
fingers
up
and
down
the
keys
did
you
say
you
knew
debussy
he
said
suddenly
i
no
but
he
used
to
come
to
see
my
father
when
i
was
a
little
girl
i
have
been
brought
up
in
the
middle
of
music
that
shows
how
silly
it
is
to
be
a
woman
there
is
no
music
in
my
head
of
course
i
am
sensitive
to
it
but
so
are
the
tables
and
chairs
in
this
apartment
after
all
they
andrews
started
playing
schumann
he
stopped
suddenly
can
you
sing
he
said
i
like
to
do
the
proses
lyriques
i
never
heard
i
once
tried
to
sing
le
soir
she
said
wonderful
do
bring
it
but
good
lord
it
too
what
is
the
use
of
being
fond
of
music
if
you
are
willing
to
mangle
it
for
the
sake
of
producing
it
i
swear
i
rather
hear
a
man
picking
out
aupres
de
ma
blonde
on
a
trombone
that
kreisler
playing
paganini
impeccably
enough
to
make
you
but
there
is
a
middle
he
interrupted
her
by
starting
to
play
again
as
he
played
without
looking
at
her
he
felt
that
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
him
that
she
was
standing
tensely
behind
him
her
hand
touched
his
shoulder
he
stopped
playing
oh
i
am
dreadfully
sorry
she
said
nothing
i
am
you
were
playing
something
of
your
own
have
you
ever
read
la
tentation
de
saint
antoine
he
asked
in
a
low
voice
flaubert
it
not
his
best
work
a
very
interesting
failure
though
she
said
andrews
got
up
from
the
piano
with
difficulty
controlling
a
sudden
growing
irritation
they
seem
to
teach
everybody
to
say
that
he
muttered
suddenly
he
realized
that
other
people
were
in
the
room
he
went
up
to
mme
rod
you
must
excuse
me
he
said
i
have
an
engagement
aubrey
let
me
drag
you
away
i
am
late
i
got
to
you
must
come
to
see
us
thank
you
mumbled
andrews
genevieve
rod
went
with
him
to
the
door
we
must
know
each
other
better
she
said
i
like
you
for
going
off
in
a
andrews
flushed
i
was
badly
brought
up
he
said
pressing
her
thin
cold
hand
and
you
french
must
always
remember
that
we
are
barbarians
some
are
repentant
barbarians
i
am
she
laughed
and
john
andrews
ran
down
the
stairs
and
out
into
the
streets
where
the
lamps
were
blooming
into
primrose
color
he
had
a
confused
feeling
that
he
had
made
a
fool
of
himself
which
made
him
writhe
with
helpless
anger
he
walked
with
long
strides
through
the
streets
of
the
rive
gauche
full
of
people
going
home
from
work
towards
the
little
wine
shop
on
the
quai
de
la
tournelle
it
was
a
paris
sunday
morning
old
women
in
black
shawls
were
going
into
the
church
of
each
time
the
leather
doors
opened
it
let
a
little
whiff
of
incense
out
into
the
smoky
morning
air
three
pigeons
walked
about
the
cobblestones
putting
their
coral
feet
one
before
the
other
with
an
air
of
importance
the
pointed
facade
of
the
church
and
its
slender
tower
and
cupola
cast
a
bluish
shadow
on
the
square
in
front
of
it
into
which
the
shadows
the
old
women
trailed
behind
them
vanished
as
they
hobbled
towards
the
church
the
opposite
side
of
the
square
and
the
railing
of
the
pantheon
and
its
tall
flank
were
flooded
with
dull
sunlight
andrews
walked
back
and
forth
in
front
of
the
church
looking
at
the
sky
and
the
pigeons
and
the
facade
of
the
library
of
ste
genevieve
and
at
the
rare
people
who
passed
across
the
end
of
the
square
noting
forms
and
colors
and
small
comical
aspects
of
things
with
calm
delight
savoring
everything
almost
with
complacency
his
music
he
felt
was
progressing
now
that
undisturbed
he
lived
all
day
long
in
the
rhythm
of
it
his
mind
and
his
fingers
were
growing
supple
the
hard
moulds
that
had
grown
up
about
his
spirit
were
softening
as
he
walked
back
and
forth
in
front
of
the
church
waiting
for
jeanne
he
took
an
inventory
of
his
state
of
mind
he
was
very
happy
eh
bien
jeanne
had
come
up
behind
him
they
ran
like
children
hand
in
hand
across
the
sunny
square
i
have
not
had
any
coffee
yet
said
andrews
how
late
you
must
get
up
but
you
ca
have
any
till
we
get
to
the
porte
maillot
why
not
because
i
say
you
but
that
it
wo
be
but
i
am
dying
with
hunger
i
will
die
in
your
ca
you
understand
once
we
get
to
the
porte
maillot
we
be
far
from
your
life
and
my
life
the
day
will
be
ours
one
must
not
tempt
you
funny
the
metro
was
not
crowded
andrews
and
jeanne
sat
opposite
each
other
without
talking
andrews
was
looking
at
the
girl
hands
limp
on
her
lap
small
overworked
hands
with
places
at
the
tips
of
the
fingers
where
the
skin
was
broken
and
scarred
with
chipped
uneven
nails
suddenly
she
caught
his
glance
he
flushed
and
she
said
jauntily
well
we
all
be
rich
some
day
like
princes
and
princesses
in
fairy
they
both
laughed
as
they
were
leaving
the
train
at
the
terminus
he
put
his
arm
timidly
round
her
waist
she
wore
no
corsets
his
fingers
trembled
at
the
litheness
of
the
flesh
under
her
clothes
feeling
a
sort
of
terror
go
through
him
he
took
away
his
arm
now
she
said
quietly
as
they
emerged
into
the
sunlight
and
the
bare
trees
of
the
broad
avenue
you
can
have
all
the
you
you
have
some
why
be
extravagant
i
had
my
petit
but
i
going
to
be
extravagant
all
day
we
might
as
well
start
now
i
do
know
exactly
why
but
i
am
very
happy
we
eat
but
my
dear
it
only
profiteers
who
can
eat
brioches
you
just
watch
they
went
into
a
patisserie
an
elderly
woman
with
a
lean
yellow
face
and
thin
hair
waited
on
them
casting
envious
glances
up
through
her
eyelashes
as
she
piled
the
rich
brown
brioches
on
a
piece
of
tissue
paper
you
pass
the
day
in
the
country
she
asked
in
a
little
wistful
voice
as
she
handed
andrews
the
change
yes
he
said
how
well
you
as
they
went
out
of
the
door
they
heard
her
muttering
o
la
jeunesse
la
they
found
a
table
in
the
sun
at
a
cafe
opposite
the
gate
from
which
they
could
watch
people
and
automobiles
and
carriages
coming
in
and
out
beyond
a
bit
of
fortifications
gave
an
look
to
things
how
jolly
it
is
at
the
porte
maillot
cried
andrews
she
looked
at
him
and
laughed
but
how
gay
he
is
no
i
always
like
it
here
it
the
spot
in
paris
where
you
always
feel
well
when
you
go
out
you
have
all
the
fun
of
leaving
town
when
you
go
in
you
have
all
the
fun
of
coming
back
to
town
but
you
eating
any
brioches
i
eaten
one
you
eat
them
you
are
jeanne
i
do
think
i
have
ever
been
so
happy
in
my
life
almost
worth
having
been
in
the
army
for
the
joy
your
freedom
gives
you
that
frightful
life
how
is
etienne
he
is
in
mayence
he
jeanne
we
must
live
very
much
we
who
are
free
to
make
up
for
all
the
people
who
are
still
a
lot
of
good
it
do
them
she
cried
laughing
it
funny
jeanne
i
threw
myself
into
the
army
i
was
so
sick
of
being
free
and
not
getting
anywhere
now
i
have
learnt
that
life
is
to
be
used
not
just
held
in
the
hand
like
a
box
of
bonbons
that
nobody
she
looked
at
him
blankly
i
mean
i
do
think
i
get
enough
out
of
life
he
said
let
they
got
to
their
feet
what
do
you
mean
she
said
slowly
one
takes
what
life
gives
that
is
all
there
no
choice
but
look
there
the
malmaison
train
we
must
giggling
and
breathless
they
climbed
on
the
trailer
squeezing
themselves
on
the
back
platform
where
everyone
was
pushing
and
exclaiming
the
car
began
to
joggle
its
way
through
neuilly
their
bodies
were
pressed
together
by
the
men
and
women
about
them
andrews
put
his
arm
firmly
round
jeanne
waist
and
looked
down
at
her
pale
cheek
that
was
pressed
against
his
chest
her
little
round
black
straw
hat
with
a
bit
of
a
red
flower
on
it
was
just
under
his
chin
i
ca
see
a
thing
she
gasped
still
giggling
i
describe
the
landscape
said
andrews
why
we
are
crossing
the
seine
oh
how
pretty
it
must
be
an
old
gentleman
with
a
pointed
white
beard
who
stood
beside
them
laughed
benevolently
but
do
you
think
the
seine
pretty
jeanne
looked
up
at
him
impudently
without
a
doubt
without
a
doubt
it
was
the
way
you
said
it
said
the
old
gentleman
you
are
going
to
germain
he
asked
andrews
no
to
oh
you
should
go
to
germain
reinach
prehistoric
museum
is
there
it
is
very
beautiful
you
should
not
go
home
to
your
country
without
seeing
are
there
monkeys
in
it
asked
jeanne
no
said
the
old
gentleman
turning
away
i
adore
monkeys
said
jeanne
the
car
was
going
along
a
broad
empty
boulevard
with
trees
and
grass
plots
and
rows
of
low
and
little
dilapidated
rooming
houses
along
either
side
many
people
had
got
out
and
there
was
plenty
of
room
but
andrews
kept
his
arm
round
the
girl
waist
the
constant
contact
with
her
body
made
him
feel
very
languid
how
good
it
smells
said
jeanne
it
the
i
want
to
lie
on
the
grass
and
eat
violets
oh
how
good
you
were
to
bring
me
out
like
this
jean
you
must
know
lots
of
fine
ladies
you
could
have
brought
out
because
you
are
so
well
educated
how
is
it
you
are
only
an
ordinary
soldier
good
god
i
would
be
an
why
it
must
be
rather
nice
to
be
an
does
etienne
want
to
be
an
officer
but
he
a
socialist
that
well
i
suppose
i
must
be
a
socialist
too
but
let
talk
of
something
andrews
moved
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
platform
they
were
passing
little
villas
with
gardens
on
the
road
where
yellow
and
crocuses
bloomed
now
and
then
there
was
a
scent
of
violets
in
the
moist
air
the
sun
had
disappeared
under
soft
clouds
there
was
occasionally
a
rainy
chill
in
the
wind
andrews
suddenly
thought
of
genevieve
rod
curious
how
vividly
he
remembered
her
face
her
wide
open
eyes
and
her
way
of
smiling
without
moving
her
firm
lips
a
feeling
of
annoyance
went
through
him
how
silly
of
him
to
go
off
rudely
like
that
and
he
became
very
anxious
to
talk
to
her
again
things
he
wanted
to
say
to
her
came
to
his
mind
well
are
you
asleep
said
jeanne
tugging
at
his
arm
here
we
andrews
flushed
furiously
oh
how
nice
it
is
here
how
nice
it
is
here
jeanne
was
saying
why
it
is
eleven
said
andrews
we
must
see
the
palace
before
lunch
cried
jeanne
and
she
started
running
up
a
lane
of
linden
trees
where
the
fat
buds
were
just
bursting
into
little
crinkling
fans
of
green
new
grass
was
sprouting
in
the
wet
ditches
on
either
side
andrews
ran
after
her
his
feet
pounding
hard
in
the
moist
gravel
road
when
he
caught
up
to
her
he
threw
his
arms
round
her
recklessly
and
kissed
her
panting
mouth
she
broke
away
from
him
and
strode
demurely
arranging
her
hat
monster
she
said
i
trimmed
this
hat
specially
to
come
out
with
you
and
you
do
your
best
to
wreck
poor
little
hat
said
andrews
but
it
is
so
beautiful
today
and
you
are
very
lovely
the
great
napoleon
must
have
said
that
to
the
empress
josephine
and
you
know
what
he
did
to
her
said
jeanne
almost
solemnly
but
she
must
have
been
awfully
bored
with
him
long
no
said
jeanne
that
how
women
they
went
through
big
iron
gates
into
the
palace
grounds
later
they
sat
at
a
table
in
the
garden
of
a
little
restaurant
the
sun
very
pale
had
just
showed
itself
making
the
knives
and
forks
and
the
white
wine
in
their
glasses
gleam
faintly
lunch
had
not
come
yet
they
sat
looking
at
each
other
silently
andrews
felt
weary
and
melancholy
he
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
jeanne
was
playing
with
some
tiny
white
daisies
with
pink
tips
to
their
petals
arranging
them
in
circles
and
crosses
on
the
tablecloth
are
they
slow
said
andrews
but
it
nice
here
is
it
jeanne
smiled
brilliantly
but
how
glum
he
looks
she
threw
some
daisies
at
him
then
after
a
pause
she
added
mockingly
it
hunger
my
dear
good
lord
how
dependent
men
are
on
food
andrews
drank
down
his
wine
at
a
gulp
he
felt
that
if
he
could
only
make
an
effort
he
could
lift
off
the
stifling
melancholy
that
was
settling
down
on
him
like
a
weight
that
kept
growing
heavier
a
man
in
khaki
with
his
face
and
neck
scarlet
staggered
into
the
garden
dragging
beside
him
a
bicycle
he
sank
into
an
iron
chair
letting
the
bicycle
fall
with
a
clatter
at
his
feet
hi
hi
he
called
in
a
hoarse
voice
a
waiter
appeared
and
contemplated
him
suspiciously
the
man
in
khaki
had
hair
as
red
as
his
face
which
was
glistening
with
sweat
his
shirt
was
torn
and
he
had
no
coat
his
breeches
and
puttees
were
invisible
for
mud
gim
me
a
beer
croaked
the
man
in
khaki
the
waiter
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
walked
away
il

andrews
mais

the
waiter

roared
the
man
in

the
waiter
brought
a
tall
narrow
yellow
glass
the
man
in
khaki
took
it
from
his
hand
drank
it
down
at
a
draught
and
handed
back
the
empty
glass
then
he
spat
wiped
his
mouth
on
the
back
of
his
hand
got
with
difficulty
to
his
feet
and
shambled
towards
andrews

the
man

dragged
an
iron
chair
behind
him
to
a
spot
near
the
table
before
sitting
down
he
bobbed
his
head
in
the
direction
of
jeanne
with
an
air
of
solemnity
tugging
at
the
same
time
at
a
lock
of
his
red
hair
after
some
fumbling
he
got
a
handkerchief
out
of
his
pocket
and
wiped
his
face
with
it
leaving
a
long
black
smudge
of
machine
oil
on
his
forehead
oi
a
bearer
of

secret

the
man

shook
hands
with
andrews
and
jeanne
jumped
on
the
bicycle
and
rode
out
of
the
garden
to
the
road
threading
his
way
through
the
iron
chairs
and
tables
was
he
a
funny
customer
cried
andrews
laughing
what
a
wonderful
joke
things
are
the
waiter
arrived
with
the
omelette
that
began
their
lunch
gives
you
an
idea
of
how
the
old
lava
bubbling
in
the
volcano
there
nowhere
on
earth
a
man
can
dance
so
well
as
on
a
but
do
talk
that
way
said
jeanne
laying
down
her
knife
and
fork
it
terrible
we
will
waste
our
youth
to
no
purpose
our
fathers
enjoyed
themselves
when
they
were
young
and
if
there
had
been
no
war
we
should
have
been
so
happy
etienne
and
i
my
father
was
a
small
manufacturer
of
soap
and
perfumery
etienne
would
have
had
a
splendid
situation
i
should
never
have
had
to
work
we
had
a
nice
house
i
should
have
been
married
but
this
way
jeanne
have
you
more
freedom
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
later
she
burst
out
but
what
the
good
of
freedom
what
can
you
do
with
it
what
one
wants
is
to
live
well
and
have
a
beautiful
house
and
be
respected
by
people
oh
life
was
so
sweet
in
france
before
the
in
that
case
it
not
worth
living
said
andrews
in
a
savage
voice
holding
himself
in
they
went
on
eating
silently
the
sky
became
overcast
a
few
drops
splashed
on
the
we
have
to
take
coffee
inside
said
andrews
and
you
think
it
is
funny
that
people
shoot
at
a
man
on
a
motorcycle
going
through
a
wood
all
that
seems
to
me
terrible
terrible
said
jeanne
look
out
here
comes
the
rain
they
ran
into
the
restaurant
through
the
first
hissing
sheet
of
the
shower
and
sat
at
a
table
near
a
window
watching
the
rain
drops
dance
and
flicker
on
the
green
iron
tables
a
scent
of
wet
earth
and
the
odor
of
sodden
leaves
came
in
borne
on
damp
gusts
through
the
open
door
a
waiter
closed
the
glass
doors
and
bolted
them
he
wants
to
keep
out
the
spring
he
ca
said
andrews
they
smiled
at
each
other
over
their
coffee
cups
they
were
in
sympathy
again
when
the
rain
stopped
they
walked
across
wet
fields
by
a
foot
path
full
of
little
clear
puddles
that
reflected
the
blue
sky
and
the
clouds
where
the
shadows
were
light
they
walked
slowly
arm
in
arm
pressing
their
bodies
together
they
were
very
tired
they
did
not
know
why
and
stopped
often
to
rest
leaning
against
the
damp
boles
of
trees
beside
a
pond
pale
blue
and
amber
and
silver
from
the
reflected
sky
they
found
under
a
big
beech
tree
a
patch
of
wild
violets
which
jeanne
picked
greedily
mixing
them
with
the
little
daisies
in
the
tight
bouquet
at
the
suburban
railway
station
they
sat
silent
side
by
side
on
a
bench
sniffing
the
flowers
now
and
then
so
sunk
in
languid
weariness
that
they
could
hardly
summon
strength
to
climb
into
a
seat
on
top
of
a
third
class
coach
which
was
crowded
with
people
coming
home
from
a
day
in
the
country
everybody
had
violets
and
crocuses
and
twigs
with
buds
on
them
in
people
stiff
citified
clothes
lingered
a
smell
of
wet
fields
and
sprouting
woods
all
the
girls
shrieked
and
threw
their
arms
round
the
men
when
the
train
went
through
a
tunnel
or
under
a
bridge
whatever
happened
everybody
laughed
when
the
train
arrived
in
the
station
it
was
almost
with
reluctance
that
they
left
it
as
if
they
felt
that
from
that
moment
their
lives
began
again
andrews
and
jeanne
walked
down
the
platform
without
touching
each
other
their
fingers
were
stained
and
sticky
from
touching
buds
and
crushing
young
sappy
leaves
and
grass
stalks
the
air
of
the
city
seemed
dense
and
unbreathable
after
the
scented
moisture
of
the
fields
they
dined
at
a
little
restaurant
on
the
quai
voltaire
and
afterwards
walked
slowly
towards
the
place
michel
feeling
the
wine
and
the
warmth
of
the
food
sending
new
vigor
into
their
tired
bodies
andrews
had
his
arm
round
her
shoulder
and
they
talked
in
low
intimate
voices
hardly
moving
their
lips
looking
long
at
the
men
and
women
they
saw
sitting
twined
in
each
other
arms
on
benches
at
the
couples
of
boys
and
girls
that
kept
passing
them
talking
slowly
and
quietly
as
they
were
bodies
pressed
together
as
theirs
were
how
many
lovers
there
are
said
andrews
are
we
lovers
asked
jeanne
with
a
curious
little
laugh
i
wonder
have
you
ever
been
crazily
in
love
jeanne
i
do
know
there
was
a
boy
in
laon
named
marcelin
but
i
was
a
little
fool
then
the
last
news
of
him
was
from
have
you
had
many
like
i
am
how
sentimental
we
are
she
cried
laughing
no
i
wanted
to
know
i
know
so
little
of
life
said
andrews
i
have
amused
myself
as
best
i
could
said
jeanne
in
a
serious
tone
but
i
am
not
frivolous
there
have
been
very
few
men
i
have
liked
so
i
have
had
few
friends
do
you
want
to
call
them
lovers
but
lovers
are
what
married
women
have
on
the
stage
all
that
sort
of
thing
is
very
not
so
very
long
ago
said
andrews
i
used
to
dream
of
being
romantically
in
love
with
people
climbing
up
the
ivy
on
castle
walls
and
fiery
kisses
on
balconies
in
the
like
at
the
opera
comique
cried
jeanne
laughing
that
was
all
very
silly
but
even
now
i
want
so
much
more
of
life
than
life
can
they
leaned
over
the
parapet
and
listened
to
the
hurrying
swish
of
the
river
now
soft
and
now
loud
where
the
reflections
of
the
lights
on
the
opposite
bank
writhed
like
golden
snakes
andrews
noticed
that
there
was
someone
beside
them
the
faint
greenish
glow
from
the
lamp
on
the
quai
enabled
him
to
recognize
the
lame
boy
he
had
talked
to
months
ago
on
the
butte
i
wonder
if
you
remember
me
he
said
you
are
the
american
who
was
in
the
restaurant
place
du
terte
i
remember
when
but
it
was
long
they
shook
hands
but
you
are
alone
said
andrews
yes
i
am
always
alone
said
the
lame
boy
firmly
he
held
out
his
hand
again
au
revoir
said
andrews
good
luck
said
the
lame
boy
andrews
heard
his
crutch
tapping
on
the
pavement
as
he
went
away
along
the
quai
jeanne
said
andrews
suddenly
you
come
home
with
me
wo
you
but
you
have
a
friend
living
with
he
gone
to
brussels
he
wo
be
back
till
i
suppose
one
must
pay
for
one
dinner
said
jeanne
maliciously
good
god
andrews
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
the
singsong
of
the
river
pouring
through
the
bridges
filled
his
ears
he
wanted
desperately
to
cry
bitter
desire
that
was
like
hatred
made
his
flesh
tingle
made
his
hands
ache
to
crush
her
hands
in
them
come
along
he
said
gruffly
i
did
mean
to
say
that
she
said
in
a
gentle
tired
voice
you
know
i
not
a
very
nice
the
greenish
glow
of
the
lamp
lit
up
the
contour
of
one
of
her
cheeks
as
she
tilted
her
head
up
and
glimmered
in
her
eyes
a
soft
sentimental
sadness
suddenly
took
hold
of
andrews
he
felt
as
he
used
to
feel
when
as
a
very
small
child
his
mother
used
to
tell
him
br
rabbit
stories
and
he
would
feel
himself
drifting
helplessly
on
the
stream
of
her
soft
voice
narrating
drifting
towards
something
unknown
and
very
sad
which
he
could
not
help
they
started
walking
again
past
the
pont
neuf
towards
the
glare
of
the
place
michel
three
names
had
come
into
andrews
head
arsinoe
berenike
for
a
little
while
he
puzzled
over
them
and
then
he
remembered
that
genevieve
rod
had
the
large
eyes
and
the
wide
smooth
forehead
and
the
firm
little
lips
the
women
had
in
the
portraits
that
were
sewn
on
the
mummy
cases
in
the
fayum
but
those
patrician
women
of
alexandria
had
not
had
chestnut
hair
with
a
glimpse
of
burnished
copper
in
it
they
might
have
dyed
it
though
why
are
you
laughing
asked
jeanne
because
things
are
so
perhaps
you
mean
people
are
silly
she
said
looking
up
at
him
out
of
the
corners
of
her
eyes
you
they
walked
in
silence
till
they
reached
andrews
door
you
go
up
first
and
see
that
there
no
one
there
said
jeanne
in
a
tone
andrews
hands
were
cold
he
felt
his
heart
thumping
while
he
climbed
the
stairs
the
room
was
empty
a
fire
was
ready
to
light
in
the
small
fireplace
andrews
hastily
tidied
up
the
table
and
kicked
under
the
bed
some
soiled
clothes
that
lay
in
a
heap
in
a
corner
a
thought
came
to
him
how
like
his
performances
in
his
room
at
college
when
he
had
heard
that
a
relative
was
coming
to
see
him
he
tiptoed
downstairs
bien
tu
peux
venir
jeanne
he
said
she
sat
down
rather
stiffly
in
the
armchair
beside
the
fire
how
pretty
the
fire
is
she
said
jeanne
i
think
i
crazily
in
love
with
you
said
andrews
in
an
excited
voice
like
at
the
opera
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
the
nice
she
said
oh
but
what
a
big
bed
you
the
first
woman
who
been
up
here
in
my
time
jeanne
oh
but
this
uniform
is
andrews
thought
suddenly
of
all
the
tingling
bodies
constrained
into
the
rigid
attitudes
of
automatons
in
uniforms
like
this
one
of
all
the
hideous
farce
of
making
men
into
machines
oh
if
some
gesture
of
his
could
only
free
them
all
for
life
and
freedom
and
joy
the
thought
drowned
everything
else
for
the
moment
but
you
pulled
a
button
off
cried
jeanne
laughing
hysterically
just
have
to
sew
it
on
never
mind
if
you
knew
how
i
hated
what
white
skin
you
have
like
a
woman
i
suppose
that
because
you
are
blond
said
jeanne
the
sound
of
the
door
being
shaken
vigorously
woke
andrews
he
got
up
and
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
for
a
moment
without
being
able
to
collect
his
wits
the
shaking
of
the
door
continued
and
he
heard
walters
voice
crying
andy
andrews
felt
shame
creeping
up
through
him
like
nausea
he
felt
a
passionate
disgust
towards
himself
and
jeanne
and
walters
he
had
an
impulse
to
move
furtively
as
if
he
had
stolen
something
he
went
to
the
door
and
opened
it
a
little
say
walters
old
man
he
said
i
ca
let
you
in
i
got
a
girl
with
me
i
sorry
i
thought
you
would
get
back
till
you
kidding
are
you
came
walters
voice
out
of
the
dark
hall
andrews
shut
the
door
decisively
and
bolted
it
again
jeanne
was
still
asleep
her
black
hair
had
come
undone
and
spread
over
the
pillow
andrews
pulled
the
covers
up
about
her
carefully
then
he
got
into
the
other
bed
where
he
lay
awake
a
long
time
staring
at
the
ceiling
iv
people
walking
along
the
boulevard
looked
curiously
through
the
railing
at
the
line
of
men
in
that
straggled
round
the
edge
of
the
courtyard
the
line
moved
slowly
past
a
table
where
an
officer
and
two
enlisted
men
sat
poring
over
big
lists
of
names
and
piles
of
palely
tinted
banknotes
and
silver
francs
that
glittered
white
above
the
heads
a
thin
haze
of
cigarette
smoke
rose
into
the
sunlight
there
was
a
sound
of
voices
and
of
feet
shuffling
on
the
gravel
the
men
who
had
been
paid
went
off
jauntily
the
money
jingling
in
their
pockets
the
men
at
the
table
had
red
faces
and
tense
serious
expressions
they
pushed
the
money
into
the
soldiers
hands
with
a
rough
jerk
and
pronounced
the
names
as
if
they
were
machines
clicking
andrews
saw
that
one
of
the
men
at
the
table
was
walters
he
smiled
and
whispered
hello
as
he
came
up
to
him
walters
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
list
while
andrews
was
waiting
for
the
man
ahead
of
him
to
be
paid
he
heard
two
men
in
the
line
talking
was
that
a
hell
of
a
place
remember
the
lad
that
died
in
the
barracks
one
day
sure
i
was
in
the
medicks
there
too
there
was
a
hell
of
a
sergeant
in
that
company
tried
to
make
the
kid
get
up
and
the
loot
came
and
said
he
him
an
then
they
found
out
that
he
cashed
in
his
what
die
of
heart
failure
i
guess
i
dunno
though
he
never
did
take
to
the
no
that
place
cosne
was
enough
to
make
any
guy
cash
in
his
andrews
got
his
money
as
he
was
walking
away
he
strolled
up
to
the
two
men
he
had
heard
talking
were
you
fellows
in
cosne
did
you
know
a
fellow
named
fuselli
i
dunno
sure
you
do
said
the
other
man
you
remember
dan
fuselli
the
little
wop
thought
he
was
goin
to
be
he
had
another
think
they
both
laughed
andrews
walked
off
vaguely
angry
there
were
many
soldiers
on
the
boulevard
montparnasse
he
turned
into
a
side
street
feeling
suddenly
furtive
and
humble
as
if
he
would
hear
any
minute
the
harsh
voice
of
a
sergeant
shouting
orders
at
him
the
silver
in
his
breeches
pocket
jingled
with
every
step
andrews
leaned
on
the
balustrade
of
the
balcony
looking
down
into
the
square
in
front
of
the
opera
comique
he
was
dizzy
with
the
beauty
of
the
music
he
had
been
hearing
he
had
a
sense
somewhere
in
the
distances
of
his
mind
of
the
great
rhythm
of
the
sea
people
chattered
all
about
him
on
the
wide
crowded
balcony
but
he
was
only
conscious
of
the
mistiness
of
the
night
where
the
lights
made
patterns
in
and
and
compelling
his
attention
from
everything
else
the
rhythm
swept
through
him
like
sea
waves
i
thought
you
be
here
said
genevieve
rod
in
a
quiet
voice
beside
him
andrews
felt
strangely
it
nice
to
see
you
he
blurted
out
after
looking
at
her
silently
for
a
moment
of
course
you
love
it
is
the
first
time
i
heard
why
have
you
been
to
see
us
it
two
weeks
we
been
expecting
i
did
know
oh
i
certainly
come
i
do
know
anyone
at
present
i
can
talk
music
you
know
anyone
else
i
should
have
are
you
working
yes
but
this
hinders
andrews
yanked
at
the
front
of
his
tunic
still
i
expect
to
be
free
very
soon
i
putting
in
an
application
for
i
suppose
you
will
feel
you
can
do
so
much
better
you
will
be
much
stronger
now
that
you
have
done
your
no
by
no
tell
me
what
was
that
you
played
at
our
house
three
green
riders
on
wild
asses
said
andrews
smiling
what
do
you
mean
it
a
prelude
to
the
of
sheba
said
andrews
if
you
think
the
same
as
emile
faguet
and
everyone
else
about
antoine
i
tell
you
what
i
that
was
very
silly
of
me
but
if
you
pick
up
all
the
silly
things
people
say
accidentally
well
you
must
be
angry
most
of
the
in
the
dim
light
he
could
not
see
her
eyes
there
was
a
little
glow
on
the
curve
of
her
cheek
coming
from
under
the
dark
of
her
hat
to
her
rather
pointed
chin
behind
it
he
could
see
other
faces
of
men
and
women
crowded
on
the
balcony
talking
lit
up
crudely
by
the
gold
glare
that
came
out
through
the
french
windows
from
the
lobby
i
have
always
been
tremendously
fascinated
by
the
place
in
la
tentation
where
the
queen
of
sheba
visited
antoine
that
all
said
andrews
gruffly
is
that
the
first
thing
you
done
it
made
me
think
a
little
of
the
first
that
at
all
pretentious
it
probably
just
a
steal
from
everything
i
ever
no
it
good
i
suppose
you
had
it
in
your
head
all
through
those
dreadful
and
glorious
days
at
the
front
is
it
for
piano
or
orchestra
all
that
finished
is
for
piano
i
hope
to
orchestrate
it
eventually
oh
but
it
really
silly
to
talk
this
way
i
do
know
enough
i
need
years
of
hard
work
before
i
can
do
anything
and
i
have
wasted
so
much
time
that
is
the
most
frightful
thing
one
has
so
few
years
of
youth
there
the
bell
we
must
scuttle
back
to
our
seats
till
the
next
she
slipped
through
the
glass
doors
and
disappeared
andrews
went
back
to
his
seat
very
excited
full
of
unquiet
exultation
the
first
strains
of
the
orchestra
were
pain
he
felt
them
so
acutely
after
the
last
act
they
walked
in
silence
down
a
dark
street
hurrying
to
get
away
from
the
crowds
of
the
boulevards
when
they
reached
the
avenue
de
she
said
did
you
say
you
were
going
to
stay
in
france
yes
indeed
if
i
can
i
am
going
tomorrow
to
put
in
an
application
for
discharge
in
what
will
you
do
then
i
shall
have
to
find
a
job
of
some
sort
that
will
let
me
study
at
the
schola
cantorum
but
i
have
enough
money
to
last
a
little
you
are
i
forgot
to
ask
you
if
you
would
rather
take
the
no
let
they
went
under
the
arch
of
the
louvre
the
air
was
full
of
a
fine
wet
mist
so
that
every
street
lamp
was
surrounded
by
a
blur
of
light
my
blood
is
full
of
the
music
of
debussy
said
genevieve
rod
spreading
out
her
arms
it
no
use
trying
to
say
what
one
feels
about
it
words
are
much
good
anyway
are
they
that
they
walked
silently
along
the
quais
the
mist
was
so
thick
they
could
not
see
the
seine
but
whenever
they
came
near
a
bridge
they
could
hear
the
water
rustling
through
the
arches
france
is
stifling
said
andrews
all
of
a
sudden
it
stifles
you
very
slowly
with
beautiful
silk
bands
america
beats
your
brains
out
with
a
policeman
what
do
you
mean
she
asked
letting
pique
chill
her
voice
you
know
so
much
in
france
you
have
made
the
world
so
neat
but
you
seem
to
want
to
stay
here
she
said
with
a
laugh
it
that
there
nowhere
else
there
is
nowhere
except
paris
where
one
can
find
out
things
about
music
particularly
but
i
am
one
of
those
people
who
was
not
made
to
be
only
sheep
are
i
think
i
have
been
happier
this
month
in
paris
than
ever
before
in
my
life
it
seems
six
so
much
has
happened
in
poissac
is
where
i
am
where
is
that
we
have
a
country
house
there
very
old
and
very
tumbledown
they
say
that
rabelais
used
to
come
to
the
village
but
our
house
is
from
later
from
the
time
of
henri
quatre
poissac
is
not
far
from
tours
an
ugly
name
is
it
but
to
me
it
is
very
beautiful
the
house
has
orchards
all
round
it
and
yellow
roses
with
flushed
centers
poke
themselves
in
my
window
and
there
is
a
little
tower
like
when
i
get
out
of
the
army
i
shall
go
somewhere
in
the
country
and
work
and
music
should
be
made
in
the
country
when
the
sap
is
rising
in
the
nature
as
the
rabbit
man
who
the
rabbit
man
a
very
pleasant
person
said
andrews
bubbling
with
laughter
you
shall
meet
him
some
day
he
sells
little
stuffed
rabbits
that
jump
outside
the
cafe
de
here
we
are
thank
you
for
coming
home
with
but
how
soon
are
you
sure
it
is
the
house
we
ca
have
got
there
as
soon
as
yes
it
my
house
said
genevieve
rod
laughing
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
and
he
shook
it
eagerly
the
latchkey
clicked
in
the
door
why
do
you
have
a
cup
of
tea
with
us
here
tomorrow
she
said
with
the
big
varnished
door
with
its
knocker
in
the
shape
of
a
ring
closed
behind
her
andrews
walked
away
with
a
light
step
feeling
jolly
and
exhilarated
as
he
walked
down
the
quai
towards
the
place
michel
his
ears
were
filled
with
the
lisping
gurgle
of
the
river
past
the
piers
of
the
bridges
walters
was
asleep
on
the
table
in
his
room
was
a
card
from
jeanne
andrews
read
the
card
holding
it
close
to
the
candle
how
long
it
is
since
i
saw
you
it
read
i
shall
pass
the
cafe
de
rohan
wednesday
at
seven
along
the
pavement
opposite
the
magazin
du
it
was
a
card
of
malmaison
andrews
flushed
bitter
melancholy
throbbed
through
him
he
walked
languidly
to
the
window
and
looked
out
into
the
dark
court
a
window
below
his
spilled
a
warm
golden
haze
into
the
misty
night
through
which
he
could
make
out
vaguely
some
pots
of
ferns
standing
on
the
wet
flagstones
from
somewhere
came
a
dense
smell
of
hyacinths
fragments
of
thought
slipped
one
after
another
through
his
mind
he
thought
of
himself
washing
windows
long
ago
at
training
camp
and
remembered
the
way
the
gritty
sponge
scraped
his
hands
he
could
not
help
feeling
shame
when
he
thought
of
those
days
well
that
all
over
now
he
told
himself
he
wondered
in
a
way
about
genevieve
rod
what
sort
of
a
person
was
she
her
face
with
its
wide
eyes
and
pointed
chin
and
the
hair
unpretentiously
coiled
above
the
white
forehead
was
very
vivid
in
his
mind
though
when
he
tried
to
remember
what
it
was
like
in
profile
he
could
not
she
had
thin
hands
with
long
fingers
that
ought
to
play
the
piano
well
when
she
grew
old
would
she
be
and
jolly
like
her
mother
he
could
not
think
of
her
old
she
was
too
vigorous
there
was
too
much
malice
in
her
gestures
the
memory
of
her
faded
and
there
came
to
his
mind
jeanne
overworked
little
hands
with
callous
places
and
the
tips
of
the
fingers
grimy
and
scarred
from
needlework
but
the
smell
of
hyacinths
that
came
up
from
the
courtyard
was
like
a
sponge
wiping
all
impressions
from
his
brain
the
dense
sweet
smell
in
the
damp
air
made
him
feel
languid
and
melancholy
he
took
off
his
clothes
slowly
and
got
into
bed
the
smell
of
the
hyacinths
came
to
him
very
faintly
so
that
he
did
not
know
whether
or
not
he
was
imagining
it
the
major
office
was
a
large
room
with
elaborate
mouldings
and
mirrors
in
all
four
walls
so
that
while
andrews
waited
cap
in
hand
to
go
up
to
the
desk
he
could
see
the
small
round
major
with
his
pink
face
and
bald
head
repeated
to
infinity
in
two
directions
in
the
grey
brilliance
of
the
mirrors
what
do
you
want
said
the
major
looking
up
from
some
papers
he
was
signing
andrews
stepped
up
to
the
desk
on
both
sides
of
the
room
a
skinny
figure
in
repeated
endlessly
stepped
up
to
endless
mahogany
desks
which
faded
into
each
other
in
an
endless
dusty
perspective

this
application
for
discharge
major
how
many
dependents
muttered
the
major
through
his
teeth
poring
over
the
application

for
discharge

france

except

affidavit

go
through
in
short
order
we
glad
to
release
men
we
glad
to
release
any
man
with
a
good
military
record
williams
yes
a
sergeant
came
over
from
a
small
table
by
the
door
show
this
man
what
he
needs
to
do
to
get
discharged
in
andrews
saluted
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
he
saw
the
figures
in
the
mirror
saluting
down
an
endless
corridor
when
he
got
out
on
the
street
in
front
of
the
great
white
building
where
the
major
office
was
a
morose
feeling
of
helplessness
came
over
him
there
were
many
automobiles
of
different
sizes
and
shapes
limousines
runabouts
touring
cars
lined
up
along
the
curb
all
painted
and
neatly
stenciled
with
numbers
in
white
now
and
then
a
personage
came
out
of
the
white
marble
building
puttees
and
sam
browne
belt
gleaming
and
darted
into
an
automobile
or
a
noisy
motorcycle
stopped
with
a
jerk
in
front
of
the
wide
door
to
let
out
an
officer
in
goggles
and
trench
coat
who
disappeared
immediately
through
revolving
doors
andrews
could
imagine
him
striding
along
halls
where
from
every
door
came
an
imperious
clicking
of
typewriters
where
papers
were
piled
high
on
yellow
varnished
desks
where
clerks
in
uniform
loafed
in
rooms
where
the
four
walls
were
covered
from
floor
to
ceiling
with
card
catalogues
and
every
day
they
were
adding
to
the
paper
piling
up
more
little
drawers
with
index
cards
it
seemed
to
andrews
that
the
shiny
white
marble
building
would
have
to
burst
with
all
the
paper
stored
up
within
it
and
would
flood
the
broad
avenue
with
avalanches
of
index
cards
button
yer
coat
snarled
a
voice
in
his
ear
andrews
looked
up
suddenly
an
with
a
face
in
which
was
a
long
sharp
nose
had
come
up
to
him
andrews
buttoned
up
his
overcoat
and
said
nothing
ye
ca
hang
around
here
this
way
the
called
after
him
andrews
flushed
and
walked
away
without
turning
his
head
he
was
stinging
with
humiliation
an
angry
voice
inside
him
kept
telling
him
that
he
was
a
coward
that
he
should
make
some
futile
gesture
of
protest
grotesque
pictures
of
revolt
flamed
through
his
mind
until
he
remembered
that
when
he
was
very
small
the
same
tumultuous
pride
had
seethed
and
ached
in
him
whenever
he
had
been
reproved
by
an
older
person
helpless
despair
fluttered
about
within
him
like
a
bird
beating
against
the
wires
of
a
cage
was
there
no
outlet
no
gesture
of
expression
would
he
have
to
go
on
this
way
day
after
day
swallowing
the
bitter
gall
of
indignation
that
every
new
symbol
of
his
slavery
brought
to
his
lips
he
was
walking
in
an
agitated
way
across
the
jardin
des
tuileries
full
of
little
children
and
women
with
dogs
on
leashes
and
nursemaids
with
starched
white
caps
when
he
met
genevieve
rod
and
her
mother
genevieve
was
dressed
in
pearl
grey
with
an
elegance
a
little
too
fashionable
to
please
andrews
mme
rod
wore
black
in
front
of
them
a
black
and
tan
terrier
ran
from
one
side
to
the
other
on
nervous
little
legs
that
trembled
like
steel
springs
is
it
lovely
this
morning
cried
genevieve
i
did
know
you
had
a
oh
we
never
go
out
without
santo
a
protection
to
two
lone
women
you
know
said
mme
rod
laughing
viens
santo
dis
bonjour
au
he
usually
lives
at
poissac
said
genevieve
the
little
dog
barked
furiously
at
andrews
a
shrill
bark
like
a
child
squalling
he
knows
he
ought
to
be
suspicious
of
soldiers
i
imagine
most
soldiers
would
change
with
him
if
they
had
a
chance
viens
santo
viens
santo
will
you
change
lives
with
me
santo
you
look
as
if
you
been
quarrelling
with
somebody
said
genevieve
rod
lightly
i
have
with
myself
i
going
to
write
a
book
on
slave
psychology
it
would
be
very
amusing
said
andrews
in
a
gruff
breathless
voice
but
we
must
hurry
dear
or
we
be
late
to
the
tailor
said
mme
rod
she
held
out
her
hand
to
andrews
we
be
in
at
tea
time
this
afternoon
you
might
play
me
some
more
of
the
of
sheba
said
genevieve
i
afraid
i
sha
be
able
to
but
you
never
can
tell
thank
he
was
relieved
to
have
left
them
he
had
been
afraid
he
would
burst
out
into
some
childish
tirade
what
a
shame
old
henslowe
had
come
back
yet
he
could
have
poured
out
all
his
despair
to
him
he
had
often
enough
before
and
henslowe
was
out
of
the
army
now
wearily
andrews
decided
that
he
would
have
to
start
scheming
and
intriguing
again
as
he
had
schemed
and
intrigued
to
come
to
paris
in
the
first
place
he
thought
of
the
white
marble
building
and
the
officers
with
shiny
puttees
going
in
and
out
and
the
typewriters
clicking
in
every
room
and
the
understanding
of
his
helplessness
before
all
that
complication
made
him
shiver
an
idea
came
to
him
he
ran
down
the
steps
of
a
metro
station
aubrey
would
know
someone
at
the
crillon
who
could
help
him
but
when
the
train
reached
the
concorde
station
he
could
not
summon
the
will
power
to
get
out
he
felt
a
harsh
repugnance
to
any
effort
what
was
the
use
of
humiliating
himself
and
begging
favors
of
people
it
was
hopeless
anyway
in
a
fierce
burst
of
pride
a
voice
inside
of
him
was
shouting
that
he
john
andrews
should
have
no
shame
that
he
should
force
people
to
do
things
for
him
that
he
who
lived
more
acutely
than
the
rest
suffering
more
pain
and
more
joy
who
had
the
power
to
express
his
pain
and
his
joy
so
that
it
would
impose
itself
on
others
should
force
his
will
on
those
around
him
more
of
the
psychology
of
slavery
said
andrews
to
himself
suddenly
smashing
the
of
his
egoism
the
train
had
reached
the
porte
maillot
andrews
stood
in
the
sunny
boulevard
in
front
of
the
metro
station
where
the
plane
trees
were
showing
tiny
leaves
sniffing
the
smell
of
a
in
front
of
which
a
woman
stood
with
a
deft
abstracted
gesture
tying
up
bunch
after
bunch
of
violets
he
felt
a
desire
to
be
out
in
the
country
to
be
away
from
houses
and
people
there
was
a
line
of
men
and
women
buying
tickets
for
germain
still
indecisive
he
joined
it
and
at
last
almost
without
intending
it
found
himself
jolting
through
neuilly
in
the
green
trailer
of
the
electric
car
that
waggled
like
a
duck
tail
when
the
car
went
fast
he
remembered
his
last
trip
on
that
same
car
with
jeanne
and
wished
mournfully
that
he
might
have
fallen
in
love
with
her
that
he
might
have
forgotten
himself
and
the
army
and
everything
in
crazy
romantic
love
when
he
got
off
the
car
at
germain
he
had
stopped
formulating
his
thoughts
soggy
despair
throbbed
in
him
like
an
infected
wound
he
sat
for
a
while
at
the
cafe
opposite
the
chateau
looking
at
the
light
red
walls
and
the
strong
windows
and
the
jaunty
turrets
and
chimneys
that
rose
above
the
classic
balustrade
with
its
big
urns
on
the
edge
of
the
roof
the
park
through
the
tall
iron
railings
was
full
of
russet
and
pale
lines
all
mist
of
new
leaves
had
they
really
lived
more
vividly
the
people
of
the
renaissance
andrews
could
almost
see
men
with
plumed
hats
and
short
cloaks
and
elaborate
brocaded
tunics
swaggering
with
a
hand
at
the
sword
hilt
about
the
quiet
square
in
front
of
the
gate
of
the
chateau
and
he
thought
of
the
great
sudden
wind
of
freedom
that
had
blown
out
of
italy
before
which
dogmas
and
slaveries
had
crumbled
to
dust
in
contrast
the
world
today
seemed
pitifully
arid
men
seemed
to
have
shrunk
in
stature
before
the
vastness
of
the
mechanical
contrivances
they
had
invented
michael
angelo
da
vinci
aretino
cellini
would
the
strong
figures
of
men
ever
so
dominate
the
world
again
today
everything
was
congestion
the
scurrying
of
crowds
men
had
become
perhaps
it
was
inevitable
that
the
crowds
should
sink
deeper
and
deeper
in
slavery
whichever
won
tyranny
from
above
or
spontaneous
organization
from
below
there
could
be
no
individuals
he
went
through
the
gates
into
the
park
laid
out
with
a
few
flower
beds
where
pansies
bloomed
through
the
dark
ranks
of
elm
trunks
was
brilliant
sky
with
here
and
there
a
statue
standing
out
against
it
at
the
head
of
an
alley
he
came
out
on
a
terrace
beyond
the
strong
curves
of
the
pattern
of
the
iron
balustrade
was
an
expanse
of
country
pale
green
falling
to
blue
towards
the
horizon
patched
with
pink
and
houses
and
carved
with
railway
tracks
at
his
feet
the
seine
shone
like
a
curved
sword
blade
he
walked
with
long
strides
along
the
terrace
and
followed
a
road
that
turned
into
the
forest
forgetting
the
monotonous
tread
mill
of
his
thoughts
in
the
flush
that
the
fast
walking
sent
through
his
whole
body
in
the
rustling
silence
of
the
woods
where
the
moss
on
the
north
side
of
the
boles
of
the
trees
was
emerald
and
where
the
sky
was
soft
grey
through
a
lavender
lacework
of
branches
the
green
gnarled
woods
made
him
think
of
the
first
act
of
pelleas
with
his
tunic
unbuttoned
and
his
shirt
open
at
the
neck
and
his
hands
stuck
deep
in
his
pockets
he
went
along
whistling
like
a
school
boy
after
an
hour
he
came
out
of
the
woods
on
a
highroad
where
he
found
himself
walking
beside
a
cart
that
kept
pace
with
him
exactly
try
as
he
would
to
get
ahead
of
it
after
a
while
a
boy
leaned
out
hey
vous
voulez
monter
where
are
you
going
where
that
the
boy
flourished
his
whip
vaguely
towards
the
horse
head
all
right
said
andrews
these
are
potatoes
said
the
boy
make
yourself
comfortable
andrews
offered
him
a
cigarette
which
he
took
with
muddy
fingers
he
had
a
broad
face
red
cheeks
and
chunky
features
hair
escaped
spikily
from
under
a
beret
where
did
you
say
you
were
going
silly
all
these
saints
are
they
andrews
laughed
where
are
you
going
the
boy
asked
i
do
know
i
was
taking
a
the
boy
leaned
over
to
andrews
and
whispered
in
his
car
deserter

i
had
a
day

and
wanted
to
see
the
i

said
andrews
slowly
all
these
nations
all
these
hatreds
but
still
it
is
very
beautiful
life
is
very
ugly
in
let
have
something
to
drink
there
a
bistro
the
boy
jumped
down
from
the
cart
and
tied
the
horse
to
a
tree
they
went
into
a
small
wine
shop
with
a
counter
and
one
square
oak
table
but
wo
you
be
late
said
andrews
i
do
care
i
like
talking
do
you
yes
they
ordered
wine
of
an
old
woman
in
a
green
apron
who
had
three
yellow
teeth
that
protruded
from
her
mouth
when
she
spoke
i
have
had
anything
to
eat
said
andrews
wait
a
the
boy
ran
out
to
the
cart
and
came
back
with
a
canvas
bag
from
which
he
took
half
a
loaf
of
bread
and
some
cheese
my
name
marcel
the
boy
said
when
they
had
sat
for
a
while
sipping
wine
mine
is
jean
jean
i
have
a
brother
named
jean
and
my
father
name
is
andre
pleasant
is
it
but
it
must
be
a
splendid
job
working
in
a
fruit
orchard
said
andrews
munching
bread
and
cheese
it
well
paid
but
you
get
tired
of
being
in
one
place
all
the
time
it
not
as
it
is
in
brittany
marcel
paused
he
sat
rocking
a
little
on
the
stool
holding
on
to
the
seat
between
his
legs
a
curious
brilliance
came
into
his
grey
eyes
there
he
went
on
in
a
soft
voice
it
is
so
quiet
in
the
fields
and
from
every
hill
you
look
at
the
sea
i
like
that
do
you
he
turned
to
andrews
with
a
smile
you
are
lucky
to
be
free
said
andrews
bitterly
he
felt
as
if
he
would
burst
into
tears
but
you
will
be
demobilized
soon
the
butchery
is
over
you
will
go
home
to
your
family
that
will
be
good
hein
i
wonder
it
not
far
enough
away
restless
what
do
you
expect
a
fine
rain
was
falling
they
climbed
in
on
the
potato
sacks
and
the
horse
started
a
jog
trot
its
lanky
brown
shanks
glistened
a
little
from
the
rain
do
you
come
out
this
way
often
asked
marcel
i
shall
it
the
nicest
place
near
some
sunday
you
must
come
and
i
take
you
round
the
castle
is
very
fine
and
then
there
is
malmaison
where
the
great
emperor
lived
with
the
empress
andrews
suddenly
remembered
jeanne
card
this
was
wednesday
he
pictured
her
dark
figure
among
the
crowd
of
the
pavement
in
front
of
the
cafe
de
rohan
of
course
it
had
to
be
that
way
despair
so
helpless
as
to
be
almost
sweet
came
over
him
and
girls
he
said
suddenly
to
marcel
are
they
pretty
round
here
marcel
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
not
women
that
we
lack
if
a
fellow
has
money
he
said
andrews
felt
a
sense
of
shame
he
did
not
exactly
know
why
my
brother
writes
that
in
south
america
the
women
are
very
brown
and
very
passionate
added
marcel
with
a
wistful
smile
but
travelling
and
reading
books
that
what
i
like
but
look
if
you
want
to
take
the
train
back
to
paris
marcel
pulled
up
the
horse
to
a
standstill
if
you
want
to
take
the
train
cross
that
field
by
the
foot
path
and
keep
right
along
the
road
to
the
left
till
you
come
to
the
river
there
a
ferryman
the
town
herblay
and
there
a
station
and
any
sunday
before
noon
i
be
at
rue
des
eveques
reuil
you
must
come
and
take
a
walk
they
shook
hands
and
andrews
strode
off
across
the
wet
fields
something
strangely
sweet
and
wistful
that
he
could
not
analyse
lingered
in
his
mind
from
marcel
talk
somewhere
beyond
everything
he
was
conscious
of
the
great
free
rhythm
of
the
sea
then
he
thought
of
the
major
office
that
morning
and
of
his
own
skinny
figure
in
the
mirrors
repeated
endlessly
standing
helpless
and
humble
before
the
shining
mahogany
desk
even
out
here
in
these
fields
where
the
wet
earth
seemed
to
heave
with
the
sprouting
of
new
growth
he
was
not
free
in
those
office
buildings
with
white
marble
halls
full
of
the
clank
of
officers
heels
in
index
cards
and
piles
of
typewritten
papers
his
real
self
which
they
had
power
to
kill
if
they
wanted
to
was
in
his
name
and
his
number
on
lists
with
millions
of
other
names
and
other
numbers
this
sentient
body
of
his
full
of
possibilities
and
hopes
and
desires
was
only
a
pale
ghost
that
depended
on
the
other
self
that
suffered
for
it
and
cringed
for
it
he
could
not
drive
out
of
his
head
the
picture
of
himself
skinny
in
an
illfitting
uniform
repeated
endlessly
in
the
two
mirrors
of
the
major
office
all
of
a
sudden
through
bare
poplar
trees
he
saw
the
seine
he
hurried
along
the
road
splashing
now
and
then
in
a
shining
puddle
until
he
came
to
a
landing
place
the
river
was
very
wide
silvery
streaked
with
and
violet
and
from
the
evening
sky
opposite
were
bare
poplars
and
behind
them
clusters
of
houses
climbing
up
a
green
hill
to
a
church
all
repeated
upside
down
in
the
river
the
river
was
very
full
and
welled
up
above
its
banks
the
way
the
water
stands
up
above
the
rim
of
a
glass
filled
too
full
from
the
water
came
an
indefinable
rustling
flowing
sound
that
rose
and
fell
with
quiet
rhythm
in
andrews
ears
andrews
forgot
everything
in
the
great
wave
of
music
that
rose
impetuously
through
him
poured
with
the
hot
blood
through
his
veins
with
the
streaked
colors
of
the
river
and
the
sky
through
his
eyes
with
the
rhythm
of
the
flowing
river
through
his
ears
v
so
i
came
without
said
andrews
laughing
what
fun
cried
genevieve
but
anyway
they
could
do
anything
to
you
chartres
is
so
near
it
at
the
gates
of
they
were
alone
in
the
compartment
the
train
had
pulled
out
of
the
station
and
was
going
through
suburbs
where
the
trees
were
in
leaf
in
the
gardens
and
fruit
trees
foamed
above
the
red
brick
walls
among
the
villas
anyway
said
andrews
it
was
an
opportunity
not
to
be
that
must
be
one
of
the
most
amusing
things
about
being
a
soldier
avoiding
regulations
i
wonder
whether
damocles
did
really
enjoy
his
sword
do
you
think
so
they
laughed
but
mother
was
very
doubtful
about
my
coming
with
you
this
way
such
a
dear
she
wants
to
be
very
modern
and
liberal
but
she
always
gets
frightened
at
the
last
minute
and
my
aunt
will
think
the
end
has
come
when
we
they
went
through
some
tunnels
and
when
the
train
stopped
at
sevres
had
a
glimpse
of
the
seine
valley
where
the
blue
mist
made
a
patina
over
the
soft
of
new
leaves
then
the
train
came
out
on
wide
plains
full
of
the
glaucous
shimmer
of
young
oats
and
the
of
wheat
fields
where
the
mist
on
the
horizon
was
purplish
the
train
shadow
blue
sped
along
beside
them
over
the
grass
and
fences
how
beautiful
it
is
to
go
out
of
the
city
this
way
in
the
early
morning
has
your
aunt
a
piano
yes
a
very
old
and
tinkly
it
would
be
amusing
to
play
you
all
i
have
done
at
the
of
sheba
you
say
the
most
helpful
it
is
that
i
am
interested
i
think
you
will
do
something
some
andrews
shrugged
his
shoulders
they
sat
silent
their
ears
filled
up
by
the
jerking
rhythm
of
wheels
over
rails
now
and
then
looking
at
each
other
almost
furtively
outside
fields
and
hedges
and
patches
of
blossom
and
poplar
trees
faintly
powdered
with
green
unrolled
like
a
scroll
before
them
behind
the
nicker
of
telegraph
poles
and
the
festooned
wires
on
which
the
sun
gave
glints
of
red
copper
andrews
discovered
all
at
once
that
the
coppery
glint
on
the
telegraph
wires
was
the
same
as
the
glint
in
genevieve
hair
berenike
artemisia
arsinoe
the
names
lingered
in
his
mind
so
that
as
he
looked
out
of
the
window
at
the
long
curves
of
the
telegraph
wires
that
seemed
to
rise
and
fall
as
they
glided
past
he
could
imagine
her
face
with
its
large
pale
brown
eyes
and
its
small
mouth
and
broad
smooth
forehead
suddenly
stilled
into
the
encaustic
painting
on
the
mummy
case
of
some
alexandrian
girl
tell
me
she
said
when
did
you
begin
to
write
music
andrews
brushed
the
light
disordered
hair
off
his
forehead
why
i
think
i
forgot
to
brush
my
hair
this
morning
he
said
you
see
i
was
so
excited
by
the
idea
of
coming
to
chartres
with
they
laughed
but
my
mother
taught
me
to
play
the
piano
when
i
was
very
small
he
went
on
seriously
she
and
i
lived
alone
in
an
old
house
belonging
to
her
family
in
virginia
how
different
all
that
was
from
anything
you
have
ever
lived
it
would
not
be
possible
in
europe
to
be
as
isolated
as
we
were
in
virginia
mother
was
very
unhappy
she
had
led
a
dreadfully
thwarted
life
that
unrelieved
hopeless
misery
that
only
a
woman
can
suffer
she
used
to
tell
me
stories
and
i
used
to
make
up
little
tunes
about
them
and
about
anything
the
great
success
he
laughed
was
i
remember
to
a
dandelion
i
can
remember
so
well
the
way
mother
pursed
up
her
lips
as
she
leaned
over
the
writing
desk
she
was
very
tall
and
as
it
was
dark
in
our
old
sitting
room
had
to
lean
far
over
to
see
she
used
to
spend
hours
making
beautiful
copies
of
tunes
i
made
up
my
mother
is
the
only
person
who
has
ever
really
had
any
importance
in
my
life
but
i
lack
technical
training
do
you
think
it
is
so
important
said
genevieve
leaning
towards
him
to
make
herself
heard
above
the
clatter
of
the
train
perhaps
it
is
i
do
i
think
it
always
comes
sooner
or
later
if
you
feel
intensely
but
it
is
so
frightful
to
feel
all
you
want
to
express
getting
away
beyond
you
an
idea
comes
into
your
head
and
you
feel
it
grow
stronger
and
stronger
and
you
ca
grasp
it
you
have
no
means
to
express
it
it
like
standing
on
a
street
corner
and
seeing
a
gorgeous
procession
go
by
without
being
able
to
join
it
or
like
opening
a
bottle
of
beer
and
having
it
foam
all
over
you
without
having
a
glass
to
pour
it
genevieve
burst
out
laughing
but
you
can
drink
from
the
bottle
ca
you
she
said
her
eyes
sparkling
i
trying
to
said
andrews
here
we
are
there
the
cathedral
no
it
hidden
cried
genevieve
they
got
to
their
feet
as
they
left
the
station
andrews
said
but
after
all
it
only
freedom
that
matters
when
i
out
of
the
army
yes
i
suppose
you
are
right
for
you
that
is
the
artist
should
be
free
from
any
sort
of
i
do
see
what
difference
there
is
between
an
artist
and
any
other
sort
of
workman
said
andrews
savagely
no
but
from
the
square
where
they
stood
above
the
green
blur
of
a
little
park
they
could
see
the
cathedral
creamy
yellow
and
rust
color
with
the
sober
tower
and
the
gaudy
tower
and
the
great
rose
window
between
the
whole
pile
standing
nonchalantly
knee
deep
in
the
packed
roofs
of
the
town
they
stood
shoulder
to
shoulder
looking
at
it
without
speaking
in
the
afternoon
they
walked
down
the
hill
towards
the
river
that
flowed
through
a
quarter
of
tottering
houses
and
mills
from
which
came
a
sound
of
grinding
wheels
above
them
towering
over
gardens
full
of
pear
trees
in
bloom
the
apse
of
the
cathedral
bulged
against
the
pale
sky
on
a
narrow
and
very
ancient
bridge
they
stopped
and
looked
at
the
water
full
of
a
shimmer
of
blue
and
green
and
grey
from
the
sky
and
from
the
vivid
new
leaves
of
the
willow
trees
along
the
bank
their
senses
glutted
with
the
beauty
of
the
day
and
the
intricate
magnificence
of
the
cathedral
languid
with
all
they
had
seen
and
said
they
were
talking
of
the
future
with
quiet
voices
it
all
in
forming
a
habit
of
work
andrews
was
saying
you
have
to
be
a
slave
to
get
anything
done
it
all
a
question
of
choosing
your
master
do
you
think
so
yes
i
suppose
all
the
men
who
have
left
their
imprint
on
lives
have
been
slaves
in
a
sense
said
genevieve
slowly
everyone
has
to
give
up
a
great
deal
of
life
to
live
anything
deeply
but
it
worth
she
looked
andrews
full
in
the
eyes
yes
i
think
it
worth
it
said
andrews
but
you
must
help
me
now
i
am
like
a
man
who
has
come
up
out
of
a
dark
cellar
i
almost
too
dazzled
by
the
gorgeousness
of
everything
but
at
least
i
am
out
of
the
look
a
fish
jumped
cried
genevieve
i
wonder
if
we
could
hire
a
boat
anywhere
do
you
think
it
be
fun
to
go
out
in
a
boat
a
voice
broke
in
on
genevieve
answer
let
see
your
pass
will
you
andrews
turned
round
a
soldier
with
a
round
brown
face
and
red
cheeks
stood
beside
him
on
the
bridge
andrews
looked
at
him
fixedly
a
little
zigzag
scar
above
his
left
eye
showed
white
on
his
heavily
tanned
skin
let
see
your
pass
the
man
said
again
he
had
a
high
pitched
squeaky
voice
andrews
felt
the
blood
thumping
in
his
ears
are

an
well
i
in
the
sorbonne
what
the
hell
that
said
the
laughing
thinly
what

genevieve

andrews
in
a
breathless
voice

as
soon
as

arranged

serious

as
soon

said
andrews
harshly
she
walked
up
the
hill
with
swift
decisive
steps
without
turning
round
tough
luck

said
the
she
a
i

they
turned
down
a
narrow
street
between
grey
stucco
walls
leprous
with
moss
and
water
stains
at
a
chair
inside
the
window
of
a
small
wine
shop
a
man
with
a
red
badge
sat
smoking

laughter
with
a
long
drink
from

bottle

smacked

said
then
he

absently
with
his
handkerchief

had
drunk
the
raw
cognac
without
tasting

another
bottle
handsome
said
bill
huggis
carelessly
a
purplish
flush
had
appeared
in
the
lower
part
of
his
cheeks
when
the
other
man
came
back

burst
out
laughing

last

he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
shaking
with
laughter
handsome
face
was
crimson
only
the
zigzag
scar
over
his
eye
remained
white
he
was
swearing
in
a
low
voice
as
he
worked
the
cork
out
of
the
bottle
andrews
could
not
keep
his
eyes
off
the
men
faces
they
went
from
one
to
the
other
in
spite
of
him
now
and
then
for
an
instant
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
yellow
and
brown
squares
of
the
wall
paper
and
the
bar
with
a
few
empty
bottles
behind
it
he
tried
to
count
the
bottles
one
two
three
but
he
was
staring
in
the
lustreless
grey
eyes
of
bill
huggis
who
lay
back
in
his
chair
blowing
smoke
out
of
his
nose
now
and
then
reaching
for
the
cognac
bottle
all
the
while
humming
faintly
under
his
breath
it
the
smile
that
makes
you
happy
it
the
smile
that
makes
you
handsome
sat
with
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
his
chin
in
his
beefy
hands
his
face
was
flushed
crimson
but
the
skin
was
softly
moulded
like
a
woman
the
light
in
the
room
was
beginning
to
grow
grey
handsome
and
bill
huggis
stood
up
a
young
officer
with
features
and
a
campaign
hat
worn
a
little
on
one
side
came
in
stood
with
his
feet
wide
apart
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
andrews
went
up
to
him
i
in
the
sorbonne
detachment
lieutenant
stationed
in
do
you
know
enough
to
salute
said
the
officer
looking
him
up
and
down
one
of
you
men
teach
him
to
salute
he
said
slowly
handsome
made
a
step
towards
andrews
and
hit
him
with
his
fist
between
the
eyes
there
was
a
flash
of
light
and
the
room
swung
round
and
there
was
a
splitting
crash
as
his
head
struck
the
floor
he
got
to
his
feet
the
fist
hit
him
in
the
same
place
blinding
him
the
three
figures
and
the
bright
oblong
of
the
window
swung
round
a
chair
crashed
down
with
him
and
a
hard
rap
in
the
back
of
his
skull
brought
momentary
blackness
that
enough
let
him
be
he
heard
a
voice
far
away
at
the
end
of
a
black
tunnel
a
great
weight
seemed
to
be
holding
him
down
as
he
struggled
to
get
up
blinded
by
tears
and
blood
rending
pains
darted
like
arrows
through
his
head
there
were
handcuffs
on
his
wrists
git
up
snarled
a
voice
he
got
to
his
feet
faint
light
came
through
the
streaming
tears
in
his
eyes
his
forehead
flamed
as
if
hot
coals
were
being
pressed
against
it
prisoner
attention
shouted
the
officer
voice
march
automatically
andrews
lifted
one
foot
and
then
the
other
he
felt
in
his
face
the
cool
air
of
the
street
on
either
side
of
him
were
the
hard
steps
of
the
within
him
a
nightmare
voice
was
shrieking
shrieking
part
six
under
the
wheels
i
the
uncovered
garbage
cans
clattered
as
they
were
thrown
one
by
one
into
the
truck
dust
and
a
smell
of
putrid
things
hung
in
the
air
about
the
men
as
they
worked
a
guard
stood
by
with
his
legs
wide
apart
and
his
on
the
pavement
between
them
the
early
mist
hung
low
hiding
the
upper
windows
of
the
hospital
from
the
door
beside
which
the
garbage
cans
were
ranged
came
a
thick
odor
of
carbolic
the
last
garbage
can
rattled
into
place
on
the
truck
the
four
prisoners
and
the
guard
clambered
on
finding
room
as
best
they
could
among
the
cans
from
which
dripped
bloody
bandages
ashes
and
bits
of
decaying
food
and
the
truck
rumbled
off
towards
the
incinerator
through
the
streets
of
paris
that
sparkled
with
the
gaiety
of
early
morning
the
prisoners
wore
no
tunics
their
shirts
and
breeches
had
dark
stains
of
grease
and
dirt
on
their
hands
were
torn
canvas
gloves
the
guard
was
a
sheepish
youth
who
kept
grinning
apologetically
and
had
trouble
keeping
his
balance
when
the
truck
went
round
corners
how
many
days
do
they
keep
a
guy
on
this
job
happy
asked
a
boy
with
mild
blue
eyes
and
a
creamy
complexion
and
reddish
curly
hair
damned

said
the
man
next
him
who
had
a
lined
prize
fighter
face
with
a
heavy
protruding
jaw
then
after
looking
at
the
boy
for
a
minute
with
his
face
twisted
into
an
astonished
sort
of
grin
he
went
on

and
caught

of
an
ash

to

the
boy
blushing
and
casting
his
eyes
down
he
must
have
lied
like
hell

git

this
goddam
army
boomed
the
deep
voice
of
the
truck
driver
who
had
leaned
over
to
spit
s
long
squirt
of
tobacco
juice
the
truck
driver
jammed
the
brakes
on
the
garbage
cans
banged
against

o
this
labor
battalion
hoggenback
wo
it
guard
said
happy
as
he
climbed
on
again
the
truck
jolted
away
trailing
a
haze
of
cinder
dust
and
a
sour
stench
of
garbage
behind
it
andrews
noticed
all
at
once
that
they
were
going
down
the
quais
along
the
river
notre
dame
was
rosy
in
the
misty
sunlight
the
color
of
lilacs
in
full
bloom
he
looked
at
it
fixedly
a
moment
and
then
looked
away
he
felt
very
far
from
it
like
a
man
looking
at
the
stars
from
the
bottom
of
a
pit
my
mate
he
gone
to
leavenworth
for
five
years
said
the
kid
when
they
had
been
silent
some
time
listening
to
the
rattle
of
the
garbage
cans
as
the
trucks
jolted
over
the
cobbles
helped
yer
steal
the
ford
did
he
asked
happy
ford
nothin
he
sold
an
ammunition
train
he
was
a
railroad
man

was
a
mason
that
why
he
only
got
five
i
guess
five
years
in
leavenworth
enough
for
anybody
muttered
hoggenback
scowling
he
was
a
dark
man
who
always
hung
his
head
when
he
worked
we
did
meet
up
till
we
got
to
paris
we
was
on
a
hell
of
a
party
together
at
the
olympia
that
where
they
picked
us

the
bastille
ever

in
the
bastille
i
have
said
hoggenback
ai
no
joke

it
christ
said
hoggenback
his
face
flushed
a
furious
red
he
turned
away
and
looked
at
the
civilians
walking
briskly
along
the
early
morning
streets
at
the
waiters
in
shirt
sleeves
swabbing
off
the
cafe
tables
at
the
women
pushing
handcarts
full
of
vegetables
over
the
cobblestones
i
guess
they
ai
nobody
gone
through
what
we
guys
go
through
with
said
happy
it
be
better
if
the
ole

to
my
way
o
thinkin
they
chuck

into
the
trenches
then
ai
so
low
as

lively
shouted
the
truck
driver
as
the
truck
stopped
in
a
dirty
yard
full
of
cinder
piles
ai
got
all
day
five
more
loads
to
get
the
guard
stood
by
with
angry
face
and
stiff
limbs
for
he
feared
there
were
officers
about
and
the
prisoners
started
unloading
the
garbage
cans
their
nostrils
were
full
of
the
stench
of
putrescence
between
their
lips
was
a
gritty
taste
of
cinders
the
air
in
the
dark
mess
shack
was
thick
with
steam
from
the
kitchen
at
one
end
the
men
filed
past
the
counter
holding
out
their
mess
kits
into
which
the
splashed
the
food
occasionally
someone
stopped
to
ask
for
a
larger
helping
in
an
ingratiating
voice
they
ate
packed
together
at
long
tables
of
roughly
planed
boards
stained
from
the
constant
spilling
of
grease
and
coffee
and
still
wet
from
a
perfunctory
scrubbing
andrews
sat
at
the
end
of
a
bench
near
the
door
through
which
came
the
glimmer
of
twilight
eating
slowly
surprised
at
the
relish
with
which
he
ate
the
greasy
food
and
at
the
exhausted
contentment
that
had
come
over
him
almost
in
spite
of
himself
hoggenback
sat
opposite
him
funny
he
said
to
hoggenback
it
not
really
as
bad
as
i
thought
it
would

labor
battalion

thing

up
with
things
than
make
an
effort
to
change
you
goddam
right
got
a
butt
andrews
handed
him
a
cigarette
they
got
to
their
feet
and
walked
out
into
the
twilight
holding
their
mess
kits
in
front
of
them
as
they
were
washing
their
mess
kits
in
a
tub
of
greasy
water
where
bits
of
food
floated
in
a
thick
scum
hoggenback
suddenly
said
in
a
low
voice
but

all

hanging
his
head
he
went
slowly
into
the
barracks
andrews
leaned
against
the
outside
of
the
building
staring
up
at
the
sky
he
was
trying
desperately
to
think
to
pull
together
a
few
threads
of
his
life
in
this
moment
of
respite
from
the
nightmare
in
five
minutes
the
bugle
would
din
in
his
ears
and
he
would
be
driven
into
the
barracks
a
tune
came
to
his
head
that
he
played
with
eagerly
for
a
moment
and
then
as
memory
came
to
him
tried
to
efface
with
a
shudder
of
disgust
there
the
smile
that
makes
you
happy
there
the
smile
that
makes
you
it
was
almost
dark
two
men
walked
slowly
by
in

of
him

past

into
the
barracks
dull
fury

and
got
silently
into
his
blankets

andrews
felt
the
mocking
notes
of
the
bugle
outside
stabbing
his
ears
a
voice
roared
quiet
from
the
end
of
the
building
and
the
lights
went
out
already
andrews
could
hear
the
deep
breathing
of
men
asleep
he
lay
awake
staring
into
the
darkness
his
body
throbbing
with
the
monotonous
rhythms
of
the
work
of
the
day
he
seemed
still
to
hear
the
sickening
whine
in
the
man
voice
as
he
talked
to
the
sergeant
outside
in
the
twilight
and
shall
i
be
reduced
to
that
he
was
asking
himself
andrews
was
leaving
the
latrine
when
he
heard
a
voice
call
softly
yes
he
said
come
here
i
want
to
talk
to
it
was
the
kid
voice
there
was
no
light
in
the
shack
that
served
for
a
latrine
outside
they
could
hear
the
guard
humming
softly
to
himself
as
he
went
back
and
forth
before
the
barracks
door
let
you

me
be
buddies

andrews

kid
put
his
hand
suddenly
over
andrews
mouth
they
stood
rigid
so
that
they
could
hear
their
hearts
pounding
outside
there
was
a
brisk
step
on
the
gravel
the
sentry
halted
and
saluted
the
steps
faded
into
the
distance
and
the
sentry
humming
began
again
they
put
two
fellers
in
the
jug
for
a
month
for
talking
like
we
are
in
solitary

from
now
on
andrews
felt
the
kid
hand
press
his
arm
in
his
dark
airless
bunk
in
the
lowest
of
three
tiers
andrews
lay
awake
a
long
time
listening
to
the
snores
and
the
heavy
breathing
about
him
thoughts
fluttered
restlessly
in
his
head
but
in
his
blank
hopelessness
he
could
only
frown
and
bite
his
lips
and
roll
his
head
from
side
to
side
on
the
tunic
he
used
for
a
pillow
listening
with
desperate
attention
to
the
heavy
breathing
of
the
men
who
slept
above
him
and
beside
him
when
he
fell
asleep
he
dreamed
that
he
was
alone
with
genevieve
rod
in
the
concert
hall
of
the
schola
cantorum
and
that
he
was
trying
desperately
hard
to
play
some
tune
for
her
on
the
violin
a
tune
he
kept
forgetting
and
in
the
agony
of
trying
to
remember
the
tears
streamed
down
his
cheeks
then
he
had
his
arms
round
genevieve
shoulders
and
was
kissing
her
kissing
her
until
he
found
that
it
was
a
wooden
board
he
was
kissing
a
wooden
board
on
which
was
painted
a
face
with
broad
forehead
and
great
pale
brown
eyes
and
small
tight
lips
and
all
the
while
a
boy
who
seemed
to
be
both
chrisfield
and
the
kid
kept
telling
him
to
run
or
the
would
get
him
then
he
sat
frozen
in
icy
terror
with
a
bottle
in
his
hand
while
a
frightful
voice
behind
him
sang
very
loud
there
the
smile
that
makes
you
happy
there
the
smile
that
makes
you
the
bugle
woke
him
and
he
sat
up
with
such
a
start
that
he
hit
his
head
hard
against
the
bunk
above
him
he
lay
back
cringing
from
the
pain
like
a
child
but
he
had
to
hurry
desperately
to
get
his
clothes
on
in
time
for
roll
call
it
was
with
a
feeling
of
relief
that
he
found
that
mess
was
not
ready
and
that
men
were
waiting
in
line
outside
the
kitchen
shack
stamping
their
feet
and
clattering
their
mess
kits
as
they
moved
about
through
the
chilly
twilight
of
the
spring
morning
andrews
found
he
was
standing

said
hoggenback
as
he
pushed
out
his
cup
for
coffee
in
the
truck
that
was
taking
them
to
work
andrews
and
the
kid
sat
side
by
side
on
the
jouncing
backboard
and
tried
to
talk
above
the
rumble
of
the
exhaust
like

hoggenback
might
all
this
sweat
be
doin
some
good
for
us
building
a
stadium
my
gawd
pile
out
there
quick
rasped
a
voice
from
the
driver
seat
through
the
haze
of
choking
white
dust
andrews
got
now
and
then
a
glimpse
of
the
river
with
its
tugboats
sporting
their
white
cockades
of
steam
and
their
long
trailing
plumes
of
smoke
and
its
barges
and
its
bridges
where
people
walked
jauntily
back
and
forth
going
about
their
business
going
where
they
wanted
to
go
the
bags
of
cement
were
very
heavy
and
the
unaccustomed
work
sent
racking
pains
through
his
back
the
biting
dust
stung
under
his
finger
nails
and
in
his
mouth
and
eyes
all
the
morning
a
sort
of
refrain
went
through
his
head
people
have
spent
their
lives
doing
only
this
people
have
spent
their
lives
doing
only
as
he
crossed
and
recrossed
the
narrow
plank
from
the
barge
to
the
shore
he
looked
at
the
black
water
speeding
seawards
and
took
extraordinary
care
not
to
let
his
foot
slip
he
did
not
know
why
for
of
him
was
thinking
how
wonderful
it
would
be
to
drown
to
forget
in
eternal
black
silence
the
hopeless
struggle
once
he
saw
the
kid
standing
before
the
sergeant
in
charge
in
an
attitude
of
complete
exhaustion
and
caught
a
glint
of
his
blue
eyes
as
he
looked
up
appealingly
looking
like
a
child
begging
out
of
a
spanking
the
sight
amused
him
and
he
said
to
himself
if
i
had
pink
cheeks
and
cupid
bow
lips
i
might
be
able
to
go
through
life
on
my
blue
eyes
and
he
pictured
the
kid
a
fat
cherubic
old
man
stepping
out
of
a
white
limousine
the
way
people
do
in
the
movies
and
looking
about
him
with
those
same
mild
blue
eyes
but
soon
he
forgot
everything
in
the
agony
of
the
heavy
cement
bags
bearing
down
on
his
back
and
hips
in
the
truck
on
the
way
back
to
the
mess
the
kid
looking
fresh
and
smiling
among
the
sweating
men
like
ghosts
from
the
white
dust
talking
hoarsely
above
the
clatter
of
the
truck
sidled
up
very
close
to
andrews
like
swimmin
skinny
yes
i
give
a
lot
to
get
some
of
this
cement
dust
off
me
said
andrews
without
interest
i
once
won
a
boy
swimmin
race
at
coney
said
the
kid
andrews
did
not
answer
were
you
in
the
swimmin
team
or
anything
like
that
skinny
when
you
went
to
school
no
it
would
be
wonderful
to
be
in
the
water
though
i
used
to
swim
way
out
in
chesapeake
bay
at
night
when
the
water
was
andrews
suddenly
found
the
kid
blue
eyes
bright
as
flames
from
excitement
staring
into
his
god
i
an
ass
he
muttered
he
felt
the
kid
fist
punch
him
softly
in
the
back
sergeant
said
they
was
goin
to
work
us
late
as
hell
tonight
the
kid
was
saying
aloud
to
the
men
round
him

muttered
hoggenback
an
you

a
time
if
i

all
so
goddam
mad

he
skinny
hoggenback
turned
to
andrews
and
smiled
andrews
nodded
his
head
after
the
first
two
or
three
bags
andrews
carried
in
the
afternoon
it
seemed
as
if
every
one
would
be
the
last
he
could
possibly
lift
his
back
and
thighs
throbbed
with
exhaustion
his
face
and
the
tips
of
his
fingers
felt
raw
from
the
biting
cement
dust
when
the
river
began
to
grow
purple
with
evening
he
noticed
that
two
civilians
young
men
with
coats
and
canes
were
watching
the
gang
at
work
they
says
they
newspaper
reporters
writing
up
how
fast
the
being
demobilized
said
one
man
in
an
awed
voice

muttered
hoggenback
as
with
his
eyes
to
the
ground
he
passed
andrews
i
could
tell
some
things
make
their
goddam
ears
why
do
you
what
the
hell

the
edication
to
talk

like
the
sergeant
a
short
man
with
a
mustache
clipped
very
short
went
up
to
the
group
round
the
newspaper
men

on
fellers
we
got
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
this
cement

said
in
a
kindly
voice
the
sooner

get
it
in
the
sooner
we
get
listen
to
that
bastard
ai
he
juss
too
sweet
for
pie
when
company
muttered
hoggenback
on
his
way
from
the
barge
with
a
bag
of
cement
the
kid
brushed
past
andrews
without
looking
at
him
do
what
i
do
skinny
he
said
andrews
did
not
turn
round
but
his
heart
started
thumping
very
fast
a
dull
sort
of
terror
took
possession
of
him
he
tried
desperately
to
summon
his
will
power
to
keep
from
cringing
but
he
kept
remembering
the
way
the
room
had
swung
round
when
the
had
hit
him
and
heard
again
the
cold
voice
of
the
lieutenant
saying
one
of
you
men
teach
him
how
to
time
dragged
out
interminably
at
last
coming
back
to
the
edge
of
the
wharf
andrews
saw
that
there
were
no
more
bags
in
the
barge
he
sat
down
on
the
plank
too
exhausted
to
think
dusk
was
closing
down
on
everything
the
passy
bridge
stood
out
purple
against
a
great
crimson
afterglow
the
kid
sat
down
beside
him
and
threw
an
arm
trembling
with
excitement
round
his
shoulders
the
guard
lookin
the
other
way
they
wo
miss
us
till
they
get
to
the
truck
come
on
skinny
he
said
in
a
low
quiet
voice
holding
on
to
the
plank
he
let
himself
down
into
the
speeding
water
andrews
slipped
after
him
hardly
knowing
what
he
was
doing
the
icy
water
closing
about
his
body
made
him
suddenly
feel
awake
and
vigorous
as
he
was
swept
by
the
big
rudder
of
the
barge
he
caught
hold
of
the
kid
who
was
holding
on
to
a
rope
they
worked
their
way
without
speaking
round
to
the
outer
side
of
the
rudder
the
swift
river
tugging
savagely
at
them
made
it
hard
to
hold
on
now
they
ca
see
us
said
the
kid
between
clenched
teeth
can
you
work
your
shoes
an
pants
off
andrews
started
struggling
with
one
boot
the
kid
helping
to
hold
him
up
with
his
free
hand
mine
are
off
he
said
i
was
all
he
laughed
though
his
teeth
were
chattering
all
right
i
broken
the
laces
said
andrews
can
you
swim
under
water
andrews
nodded
we
want
to
make
for
that
bunch
of
barges
the
other
side
of
the
bridge
the
barge
people
hide
how
d
know
they
will
the
kid
had
disappeared
andrews
hesitated
a
moment
then
let
go
his
hold
and
started
swimming
with
the
current
for
all
his
might
at
first
he
felt
strong
and
exultant
but
very
soon
he
began
to
feel
the
icy
grip
of
the
water
bearing
him
down
his
arms
and
legs
seemed
to
stiffen
more
than
against
the
water
he
was
struggling
against
paralysis
within
him
so
that
he
thought
that
every
moment
his
limbs
would
go
rigid
he
came
to
the
surface
and
gasped
for
air
he
had
a
second
glimpse
of
figures
tiny
like
toy
soldiers
gesticulating
wildly
on
the
deck
of
the
barge
the
report
of
a
rifle
snapped
through
the
air
he
dove
again
without
thinking
as
if
his
body
were
working
independently
of
his
mind
the
next
time
he
came
up
his
eyes
were
blurred
from
the
cold
there
was
a
taste
of
blood
in
his
mouth
the
shadow
of
the
bridge
was
just
above
him
he
turned
on
his
back
for
a
second
there
were
lights
on
the
bridge
a
current
swept
him
past
one
barge
and
then
another
certainty
possessed
him
that
he
was
going
to
be
drowned
a
voice
seemed
to
sob
in
his
ears
grotesquely
and
so
john
andrews
was
drowned
in
the
seine
drowned
in
the
seine
in
the
then
he
was
kicking
and
fighting
in
a
furious
rage
against
the
coils
about
him
that
wanted
to
drag
him
down
and
away
the
black
side
of
a
barge
was
slipping
up
stream
beside
him
with
lightning
speed
how
fast
those
barges
go
he
thought
then
suddenly
he
found
that
he
had
hold
of
a
rope
that
his
shoulders
were
banging
against
the
bow
of
a
small
boat
while
in
front
of
him
against
the
dull
purple
sky
towered
the
rudder
of
the
barge
a
strong
warm
hand
grasped
his
shoulder
from
behind
and
he
was
being
drawn
up
and
up
over
the
bow
of
the
boat
that
hurt
his
numbed
body
like
blows
out
of
the
clutching
coils
of
the
water
hide
me
i
a
deserter
he
said
over
and
over
again
in
french
a
brown
and
red
face
with
a
bristly
white
beard
a
bulbous
mullioned
sort
of
face
hovered
over
him
in
the
middle
of
a
pinkish
mist
ii
oh
est
propre
oh
a
la
peau
blanche
women
voices
were
shrilling
behind
the
mist
a
coverlet
that
felt
soft
and
fuzzy
against
his
skin
was
being
put
about
him
he
was
very
warm
and
torpid
but
somewhere
in
his
thoughts
a
black
crawling
thing
like
a
spider
was
trying
to
reach
him
trying
to
work
its
way
through
the
pinkish
veils
of
torpor
after
a
long
while
he
managed
to
roll
over
and
looked
about
him
mais
reste
tranquille
came
the
woman
shrill
voice
again
and
the
other
one
did
you
see
the
other
one
he
asked
in
a
choked
whisper
yes
it
all
right
i
drying
it
by
the
stove
came
another
voice
deep
and
growling
almost
like
a
man
maman
drying
your
money
by
the
stove
it
all
safe
how
rich
they
are
these
americans
and
to
think
that
i
nearly
threw
it
overboard
with
the
trousers
said
the
other
woman
again
john
andrews
began
to
look
about
him
he
was
in
a
dark
low
cabin
behind
him
in
the
direction
of
the
voices
a
yellow
light
flickered
great
dishevelled
shadows
of
heads
moved
about
on
the
ceiling
through
the
close
smell
of
the
cabin
came
a
warmth
of
food
cooking
he
could
hear
the
soothing
hiss
of
frying
grease
but
did
you
see
the
kid
he
asked
in
english
dazedly
trying
to
pull
himself
together
to
think
coherently
then
he
went
on
in
french
in
a
more
natural
voice
there
was
another
one
with
we
saw
no
one
rosaline
ask
the
old
man
said
the
older
woman
no
he
did
see
anyone
came
the
girl
shrill
voice
she
walked
over
to
the
bed
and
pulled
the
coverlet
round
andrews
with
an
awkward
gesture
looking
up
at
her
he
had
a
glimpse
of
the
bulge
of
her
breasts
and
her
large
teeth
that
glinted
in
the
lamplight
and
very
vague
in
the
shadow
a
mop
of
snaky
disordered
hair
parle
bien
francais
she
said
beaming
at
him
heavy
steps
shuffled
across
the
cabin
as
the
older
woman
came
up
to
the
bed
and
peered
in
his
face
il
va
mieux
she
said
with
a
knowing
air
she
was
a
broad
woman
with
a
broad
flat
face
and
a
swollen
body
swathed
in
shawls
her
eyebrows
were
very
bushy
and
she
had
thick
grey
whiskers
that
came
down
to
a
point
on
either
side
of
her
mouth
as
well
as
a
few
bristling
hairs
on
her
chin
her
voice
was
deep
and
growling
and
seemed
to
come
from
far
down
inside
her
huge
body
steps
creaked
somewhere
and
the
old
man
looked
at
him
through
spectacles
placed
on
the
end
of
his
nose
andrews
recognized
the
irregular
face
full
of
red
knobs
and
protrusions
thanks
very
much
he
said
all
three
looked
at
him
silently
for
some
time
then
the
old
man
pulled
a
newspaper
out
of
his
pocket
unfolded
it
carefully
and
fluttered
it
above
andrews
eyes
in
the
scant
light
andrews
made
out
the
name
that
why
said
the
old
man
looking
at
andrews
fixedly
through
his
spectacles
i
a
sort
of
a
socialist
said
andrews
socialists
are
snarled
the
old
man
every
red
protrusion
on
his
face
seeming
to
get
redder
but
i
have
great
sympathy
for
anarchist
comrades
went
on
andrews
feeling
a
certain
liveliness
of
amusement
go
through
him
and
fade
again
lucky
you
caught
hold
of
my
rope
instead
of
getting
on
to
the
next
barge
he
have
given
you
up
for
sure
sont

we
must
give
him
something
to
eat

wo

little
american
andrews
nodded
his
head
all
you
want
he
said
no
if
he
says
he
a
comrade
he
sha
pay
not
a
sou
growled
the
old
man
we
see
about
that
cried
the
old
woman
drawing
her
breath
in
with
an
angry
whistling
sound
it
only
that
living
so
dear
nowadays
came
the
girl
voice
oh
i
pay
anything
i
got
said
andrews
peevishly
closing
his
eyes
again
he
lay
a
long
while
on
his
back
without
moving
a
hand
shoved
in
between
his
back
and
the
pillow
roused
him
he
sat
up
rosaline
was
holding
a
bowl
of
broth
in
front
of
him
that
steamed
in
his
face
mange
ca
she
said
he
looked
into
her
eyes
smiling
her
rusty
hair
was
neatly
combed
a
bright
green
parrot
with
a
scarlet
splash
in
its
wings
balanced
itself
unsteadily
on
her
shoulder
looking
at
andrews
out
of
angry
eyes
hard
as
gems
il
est
jaloux
coco
said
rosaline
with
a
shrill
little
giggle
andrews
took
the
bowl
in
his
two
hands
and
drank
some
of
the
scalding
broth
it
too
hot
he
said
leaning
back
against
the
girl
arm
the
parrot
squawked
out
a
sentence
that
andrews
did
not
understand
andrews
heard
the
old
man
voice
answer
from
somewhere
behind
him
nom
de
dieu
the
parrot
squawked
again
rosaline
laughed
it
the
old
man
who
taught
him
that
she
said
poor
coco
he
know
what
he
what
does
he
say
asked
andrews
bourgeois
a
la
lanterne
nom
de
dieu
it
from
a
song
said
rosaline
oh
est
malin
ce
coco
rosaline
was
standing
with
her
arms
folded
beside
the
bunk
the
parrot
stretched
out
his
neck
and
rubbed
it
against
her
cheek
closing
and
unclosing
his
eyes
the
girl
formed
her
lips
into
a
kiss
and
murmured
in
a
drowsy
voice
tu
coco
pas
coco
bon
could
i
have
something
more
i
awfully
hungry
said
andrews
oh
i
was
forgetting
cried
rosaline
running
off
with
the
empty
bowl
in
a
moment
she
came
back
without
the
parrot
with
the
bowl
in
her
hand
full
of
a
brown
stew
of
potatoes
and
meat
andrews
ate
it
mechanically
and
handed
back
the
bowl
thank
you
he
said
i
am
going
to
he
settled
himself
into
the
bunk
rosaline
drew
the
covers
up
about
him
and
tucked
them
in
round
his
shoulders
her
hand
seemed
to
linger
a
moment
as
it
brushed
past
his
cheek
but
andrews
had
already
sunk
into
a
torpor
again
feeling
nothing
but
the
warmth
of
the
food
within
him
and
a
great
stiffness
in
his
legs
and
arms
when
he
woke
up
the
light
was
grey
instead
of
yellow
and
a
swishing
sound
puzzled
him
he
lay
listening
to
it
for
a
long
time
wondering
what
it
was
at
last
the
thought
came
with
a
sudden
warm
spurt
of
joy
that
the
barge
must
be
moving
he
lay
very
quietly
on
his
back
looking
up
at
the
faint
silvery
light
on
the
ceiling
of
the
bunk
thinking
of
nothing
with
only
a
vague
dread
in
the
back
of
his
head
that
someone
would
come
to
speak
to
him
to
question
him
after
a
long
time
he
began
to
think
of
genevieve
rod
he
was
having
a
long
conversation
with
her
about
his
music
and
in
his
imagination
she
kept
telling
him
that
he
must
finish
the
queen
of
sheba
and
that
she
would
show
it
to
monsieur
gibier
who
was
a
great
friend
of
a
certain
concert
director
who
might
get
it
played
how
long
ago
it
must
be
since
they
had
talked
about
that
a
picture
floated
through
his
mind
of
himself
and
genevieve
standing
shoulder
to
shoulder
looking
at
the
cathedral
at
chartres
which
stood
up
nonchalantly
above
the
tumultuous
roofs
of
the
town
with
its
sober
tower
and
its
gaudy
towers
and
the
great
rose
windows
between
inexorably
his
memory
carried
him
forward
moment
by
moment
over
that
day
until
he
writhed
with
shame
and
revolt
good
god
would
he
have
to
go
on
all
his
life
remembering
that
teach
him
how
to
salute
the
officer
had
said
and
handsome
had
stepped
up
to
him
and
hit
him
would
he
have
to
go
on
all
his
life
remembering
that
we
tied
up
the
uniform
with
some
stones
and
threw
it
overboard
said
rosaline
jabbing
him
in
the
shoulder
to
draw
his
attention
that
was
a
good
are
you
going
to
get
up
it
nearly
time
to
eat
how
you
have
but
i
have
anything
to
put
on
said
andrews
laughing
and
waved
a
bare
arm
above
the
bedclothes
wait
i
find
something
of
the
old
man
say
do
all
americans
have
skin
so
white
as
that
she
put
her
brown
hand
with
its
grimed
and
broken
nails
on
arm
that
was
white
with
a
few
silky
yellow
hairs
it
because
i
blond
said
andrews
there
are
plenty
of
blond
frenchmen
are
there
rosaline
ran
off
giggling
and
came
back
in
a
moment
with
a
pair
of
corduroy
trousers
and
a
torn
flannel
shirt
that
smelt
of
pipe
tobacco
that
do
for
now
she
said
it
warm
today
for
april
tonight
we
buy
you
some
clothes
and
shoes
where
are
you
going
by
god
i
do
we
going
to
havre
for
she
put
both
hands
to
her
head
and
began
rearranging
her
straggling
hair
oh
my
hair
she
said
it
the
water
you
know
you
ca
keep
on
these
filthy
barges
say
american
why
do
you
stay
with
us
a
while
you
can
help
the
old
man
run
the
he
found
suddenly
that
her
eyes
were
looking
into
his
with
trembling
eagerness
i
do
know
what
to
do
he
said
carelessly
i
wonder
if
it
safe
to
go
on
she
turned
away
from
him
petulantly
and
led
the
way
up
the
ladder
oh
le
camarade
cried
the
old
man
who
was
leaning
with
all
his
might
against
the
long
tiller
of
the
barge
come
and
help
the
barge
was
the
last
of
a
string
of
four
that
were
describing
a
wide
curve
in
the
midst
of
a
reach
of
silvery
river
full
of
glittering
patches
of
pale
lavender
hemmed
in
on
either
side
by
frail
blue
roots
of
poplars
the
sky
was
a
mottled
luminous
grey
with
occasional
patches
the
color
of
robins
eggs
andrews
breathed
in
the
dank
smell
of
the
river
and
leaned
against
the
tiller
when
he
was
told
to
answering
the
old
man
curt
questions
he
stayed
with
the
tiller
when
the
rest
of
them
went
down
to
the
cabin
to
eat
the
pale
colors
and
the
swishing
sound
of
the
water
and
the
banks
slipping
by
and
unfolding
on
either
hand
were
as
soothing
as
his
deep
sleep
had
been
yet
they
seemed
only
a
veil
covering
other
realities
where
men
stood
interminably
in
line
and
marched
with
legs
made
all
the
same
length
on
the
drill
field
and
wore
the
same
clothes
and
cringed
before
the
same
hierarchy
of
polished
belts
and
polished
puttees
and
caps
that
had
its
homes
in
vast
offices
crammed
with
index
cards
and
card
catalogues
a
world
full
of
the
tramp
of
marching
where
cold
voices
kept
saying
teach
him
how
to
like
a
bird
in
a
net
andrews
mind
struggled
to
free
itself
from
the
obsession
then
he
thought
of
his
table
in
his
room
in
paris
with
its
piled
sheets
of
ruled
paper
and
he
felt
he
wanted
nothing
in
the
world
except
to
work
it
would
not
matter
what
happened
to
him
if
he
could
only
have
time
to
weave
into
designs
the
tangled
skein
of
music
that
seethed
through
him
as
the
blood
seethed
through
his
veins
there
he
stood
leaning
against
the
long
tiller
watching
the
poplars
glide
by
here
and
there
reflected
in
the
etched
silver
mirror
of
the
river
feeling
the
moist
river
wind
flutter
his
ragged
shirt
thinking
of
nothing
after
a
while
the
old
man
came
up
out
of
the
cabin
his
face
purplish
puffing
clouds
of
smoke
out
of
his
pipe
all
right
young
fellow
go
down
and
eat
he
said
andrews
lay
flat
on
his
belly
on
the
deck
with
his
chin
resting
on
the
back
of
his
two
hands
the
barge
was
tied
up
along
the
river
bank
among
many
other
barges
beside
him
a
small
fuzzy
dog
barked
furiously
at
a
yellow
mongrel
on
the
shore
it
was
nearly
dark
and
through
the
pearly
mist
of
the
river
came
red
oblongs
of
light
from
the
taverns
along
the
bank
a
slip
of
a
new
moon
shrouded
in
haze
was
setting
behind
the
poplar
trees
amid
the
round
of
despairing
thoughts
the
memory
of
the
kid
intruded
itself
he
had
sold
a
ford
for
five
hundred
francs
and
gone
on
a
party
with
a
man
who
stolen
an
ammunition
train
and
he
wanted
to
write
for
the
italian
movies
no
war
could
down
people
like
that
andrews
smiled
looking
into
the
black
water
funny
the
kid
was
dead
probably
and
he
john
andrews
was
alive
and
free
and
he
lay
there
moping
still
whimpering
over
old
wrongs
for
god
sake
be
a
man
he
said
to
himself
he
got
to
his
feet
at
the
cabin
door
rosaline
was
playing
with
the
parrot
give
me
a
kiss
coco
she
was
saying
in
a
drowsy
voice
just
a
little
kiss
just
a
little
kiss
for
rosaline
poor
little
the
parrot
which
andrews
could
hardly
see
in
the
dusk
leaned
towards
her
fluttering
his
feathers
making
little
clucking
noises
rosaline
caught
sight
of
andrews
oh
i
thought
you
gone
to
have
a
drink
with
the
old
man
she
cried
no
i
stayed
like
it
this
life
rosaline
put
the
parrot
back
on
his
perch
where
he
swayed
from
side
to
side
squawking
in
protest
les
bourgeois
a
la
lanterne
nom
de
dieu
they
both
laughed
oh
it
must
be
a
wonderful
life
this
barge
seems
like
heaven
after
the
but
they
pay
you
well
you
seven
francs
a
that
luxury
and
be
ordered
around
all
day
long
but
you
have
no
expenses
it
clear
gain
you
men
are
funny
the
old
man
like
that
too
it
nice
here
all
by
ourselves
is
it
jean
andrews
did
not
answer
he
was
wondering
what
genevieve
rod
would
say
when
she
found
out
he
was
a
deserter
i
hate
it
it
dirty
and
cold
and
miserable
in
winter
went
on
rosaline
i
like
to
see
them
at
the
bottom
of
the
river
all
these
barges
and
paris
women
did
you
have
a
good
time
with
them
i
only
knew
one
i
go
very
little
with
all
the
same
love
nice
is
it
they
were
sitting
on
the
rail
at
the
bow
of
the
barge
rosaline
had
sidled
up
so
that
her
leg
touched
andrews
leg
along
its
whole
length
the
memory
of
genevieve
rod
became
more
and
more
vivid
in
his
mind
he
kept
thinking
of
things
she
had
said
of
the
intonations
of
her
voice
of
the
blundering
way
she
poured
tea
and
of
her
eyes
wide
open
on
the
world
like
the
eyes
of
a
woman
in
an
encaustic
painting
from
a
tomb
in
the
fayoum
mother
talking
to
the
old
woman
at
the
creamery
they
great
friends
she
wo
be
home
for
two
hours
yet
said
rosaline
she
bringing
my
clothes
is
she
but
you
all
right
as
you
but
they
your
what
does
that
matter
i
must
go
back
to
paris
soon
there
is
somebody
i
must
see
in
a
woman
andrews
nodded
but
it
not
so
bad
this
life
on
the
barge
i
just
lonesome
and
sick
of
the
old
people
that
why
i
talk
nastily
about
it
we
could
have
good
times
together
if
you
stayed
with
us
a
she
leaned
her
head
on
his
shoulder
and
put
a
hand
awkwardly
on
his
bare
forearm
how
cold
these
americans
are
she
muttered
giggling
drowsily
andrews
felt
her
hair
tickle
his
cheek
no
it
not
a
bad
life
on
the
barge
honestly
the
only
thing
is
there
nothing
but
old
people
on
the
river
it
is
life
to
be
always
with
old
people
i
want
to
have
a
good
she
pressed
her
cheek
against
his
he
could
feel
her
breath
heavy
in
his
face
after
all
it
lovely
in
summer
to
drowse
on
the
deck
that
all
warm
with
the
sun
and
see
the
trees
and
the
fields
and
the
little
houses
slipping
by
on
either
side
if
there
were
so
many
old
people
all
the
boys
go
away
to
the
cities
i
hate
old
people
they
so
dirty
and
slow
we
must
waste
our
youth
must
we
andrews
got
to
his
feet
what
the
matter
she
cried
sharply
rosaline
andrews
said
in
a
low
soft
voice
i
can
only
think
of
going
to
oh
the
paris
woman
said
rosaline
scornfully
but
what
does
that
matter
she
is
here
i
do
know
perhaps
i
shall
never
see
her
again
anyway
said
andrews
you
a
fool
you
must
amuse
yourself
when
you
can
in
this
life
and
you
a
deserter
why
they
may
catch
you
and
shoot
you
any
oh
i
know
you
right
you
right
but
i
not
made
like
that
that
she
must
be
very
good
to
you
your
little
paris
i
never
touched
rosaline
threw
her
head
back
and
laughed
raspingly
but
you
are
sick
are
you
she
cried
probably
i
remember
too
vividly
that
all
anyway
i
a
fool
rosaline
because
you
a
nice
there
were
steps
on
the
plank
that
led
to
the
shore
a
shawl
over
her
head
and
a
big
bundle
under
her
arm
the
old
woman
came
up
to
them
panting
wheezily
she
looked
from
one
to
the
other
trying
to
make
out
their
faces
in
the
dark
it
a
danger
like
that
youth
she
muttered
between
hard
short
breaths
did
you
find
the
clothes
asked
andrews
in
a
casual
voice
yes
that
leaves
you
francs
out
of
your
money
when
taken
out
for
your
food
and
all
that
does
that
suit
you
thank
you
very
much
for
your
you
paid
for
it

worry
about
that
said
the
old
woman
she
gave
him
the
bundle
here
are
your
clothes
and
the
francs
if
you
want
i
tell
you
exactly
what
each
thing
i
put
them
on
first
he
said
with
a
laugh
he
climbed
down
the
ladder
into
the
cabin
putting
on
new
clothes
made
him
suddenly
feel
strong
and
joyous
the
old
woman
had
bought
him
corduroy
trousers
cheap
cloth
shoes
a
blue
cotton
shirt
woollen
socks
and
a
black
serge
jacket
when
he
came
on
deck
she
held
up
a
lantern
to
look
at
him
does
he
look
fine
altogether
french
she
said
rosaline
turned
away
without
answering
a
little
later
she
picked
up
the
perch
and
carried
the
parrot
that
swayed
sleepily
on
the
crosspiece
down
the
ladder
les
bourgeois
a
la
lanterne
nom
de
dieu
came
the
old
man
voice
singing
on
the
shore
he
drunk
as
a
pig
muttered
the
old
woman
if
only
he
does
fall
off
the
gang
a
swaying
shadow
appeared
at
the
end
of
the
plank
standing
out
against
the
haze
of
light
from
the
houses
behind
the
poplar
trees
andrews
put
out
a
hand
to
catch
him
as
he
reached
the
side
of
the
barge
the
old
man
sprawled
against
the
cabin
do
bawl
me
out
dearie
he
said
dangling
an
arm
round
neck
and
a
hand
beckoning
vaguely
towards
his
wife
i
found
a
comrade
for
the
little
what
that
said
andrews
sharply
his
mouth
suddenly
went
dry
with
terror
he
felt
his
nails
pressing
into
the
palms
of
his
i
found
another
american
for
you
said
the
old
man
in
an
important
voice
here
he
another
shadow
appeared
at
the
end
of
the
gangplank
les
bourgeois
a
la
lanterne
nom
de
dieu
shouted
the
old
man
andrews
backed
away
cautiously
towards
the
other
side
of
the
barge
all
the
little
muscles
of
his
thighs
were
trembling
a
hard
voice
was
saying
in
his
head
drown
yourself
drown
yourself
then
they
wo
get
the
man
was
standing
on
the
end
of
the
plank
andrews
could
see
the
contour
of
the
uniform
against
the
haze
of
light
behind
the
poplar
trees
god
if
i
only
had
a
pistol
he
thought
say
buddy
where
are
you
came
an
american
voice
the
man
advanced
towards
him
across
the
deck
andrews
stood
with
every
muscle
taut
gee
you
taken
off
your
uniform
say
i
not
an
too
he
held
out
his
hand
andrews
took
the
hand
doubtfully
without
moving
from
the
edge

country
democracy
he
cleared
his
throat
and
spat
angrily
on
the
road
before
him
they
walked
on
silently
andrews
was
looking
at
the
sky
picking
out
constellations
he
knew
among
the
glittering
masses
of
stars
why
do
you
try
spain
or
italy
he
said
after
a
while
do
know
the
lingo

crossing
on
the

i
can
what
can
a
feller
do
when
he
do
dare
show
his
face
in
the
street
anyway
it
makes
you
feel
as
if
you
had
some
guts
in
you
to
be
out
on
your
own
this
way
cried
andrews
boisterously
wait
till

months
boy
and
you
think
what

yer

army

great
night
anyway
said
andrews
looks
like
we
ought
to
be
findin
a
haystack
to
sleep
it
be
different
burst
out
andrews
suddenly
if
i
did
have
friends
o
you
met
up
with
a
girl
have
you
asked
eddy
ironically
yes
the
thing
is

the
eddy
snorted
i

ai
ever
even

an
found
out
after

it
silly

confidence
in
anything
to
feel
there
someone
who
always
understand
anything
you
i
you
goin
to
git
i
do
see
why
that
would
spoil
eddy
whistled
softly
they
walked
along
briskly
without
speaking
for
a
long
time
their
steps
ringing
on
the
hard
road
while
the
dome
of
the
sky
shimmered
above
their
heads
and
from
the
ditches
came
the
singsong
shrilling
of
toads
for
the
first
time
in
months
andrews
felt
himself
bubbling
with
a
spirit
of
joyous
adventure
the
rhythm
of
the
three
green
horsemen
that
was
to
have
been
the
prelude
to
the
queen
of
sheba
began
rollicking
through
his
head
but
eddy
this
is
wonderful
it
us
against
the
universe
he
said
in
a
boisterous
voice
you
wait
said
eddy
when
andrews
walked
by
the
at
the
lazare
his
hands
were
cold
with
fear
the
did
not
look
at
him
he
stopped
on
the
crowded
pavement
a
little
way
from
the
station
and
stared
into
a
mirror
in
a
shop
window
unshaven
with
a
check
cap
on
the
side
of
his
head
and
his
corduroy
trousers
he
looked
like
a
young
workman
who
had
been
out
of
work
for
a
month
gee
clothes
do
make
a
difference
he
said
to
himself
he
smiled
when
he
thought
how
shocked
walters
would
be
when
he
turned
up
in
that
rig
and
started
walking
with
leisurely
stride
across
paris
where
everything
bustled
and
jingled
with
early
morning
where
from
every
cafe
came
a
hot
smell
of
coffee
and
fresh
bread
steamed
in
the
windows
of
the
bakeries
he
still
had
three
francs
in
his
pocket
on
a
side
street
the
fumes
of
coffee
roasting
attracted
him
into
a
small
bar
several
men
were
arguing
boisterously
at
the
end
of
the
bar
one
of
them
turned
a
ruddy
face
to
andrews
and
said
et
toi
tu
vas
chomer
le
premier
mai
i
on
strike
already
answered
andrews
laughing
the
man
noticed
his
accent
looked
at
him
sharply
a
second
and
turned
back
to
the
conversation
lowering
his
voice
as
he
did
so
andrews
drank
down
his
coffee
and
left
the
bar
his
heart
pounding
he
could
not
help
glancing
back
over
his
shoulder
now
and
then
to
see
if
he
was
being
followed
at
a
corner
he
stopped
with
his
fists
clenched
and
leaned
a
second
against
a
house
wall
where
your
nerve
where
your
nerve
he
was
saying
to
himself
he
strode
off
suddenly
full
of
bitter
determination
not
to
turn
round
again
he
tried
to
occupy
his
mind
with
plans
let
see
what
should
he
do
first
he
go
to
his
room
and
look
up
old
henslowe
and
walters
then
he
would
go
to
see
genevieve
then
he
work
work
forget
everything
in
his
work
until
the
army
should
go
back
to
america
and
there
should
be
no
more
uniforms
on
the
streets
and
as
for
the
future
what
did
he
care
about
the
future
when
he
turned
the
corner
into
the
familiar
street
where
his
room
was
a
thought
came
to
him
suppose
he
should
find
waiting
for
him
there
he
brushed
it
aside
angrily
and
strode
fast
up
the
sidewalk
catching
up
to
a
soldier
who
was
slouching
along
in
the
same
direction
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
eyes
on
the
ground
andrews
stopped
suddenly
as
he
was
about
to
pass
the
soldier
and
turned
the
man
looked
up
it
was
chrisfield
andrews
held
out
his
hand
chrisfield
seized
it
eagerly
and
shook
it
for
a
long
time

two

off
the
front
of
chrisfield
uniform
there
were
streaks
of
dirt
on
his
face
and
his
puttees
were
clothed
with
mud
he
looked
andrews
seriously
in
the
eyes
and
shook
his
head

chrisfield
walked
away
hurriedly
andrews
looked
after
him
a
moment
and
then
went
in
through
the
court
to
the
house
where
his
room
was
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
an
old
woman
voice
startled
him
mais
monsieur
andre
que
vous
avez
etrange
how
funny
you
look
dressed
like
the
concierge
was
smiling
at
him
from
her
cubbyhole
beside
the
stairs
she
sat
knitting
with
a
black
shawl
round
her
head
a
tiny
old
woman
with
a
hooked
nose
and
eyes
sunk
in
depressions
full
of
little
wrinkles
like
a
monkey
eyes
yes
at
the
town
where
i
was
demobilized
i
could
get
anything
else
stammered
andrews
oh
you
demobilized
are
you
that
why
you
been
away
so
long
monsieur
valters
said
he
did
know
where
you
were
it
better
that
way
is
it
yes
said
andrews
starting
up
the
stairs
monsieur
valters
is
in
now
went
on
the
old
woman
talking
after
him
and
you
got
in
just
in
time
for
the
first
of
oh
yes
the
strike
said
andrews
stopping
up
the
flight
it
be
dreadful
said
the
old
woman
i
hope
you
wo
go
out
young
folks
are
so
likely
to
get
into
trouble
oh
but
all
your
friends
have
been
worried
about
your
being
away
so
have
they
said
andrews
he
continued
up
the
stairs
au
revoir
au
revoir
iii
no
nothing
can
make
me
go
back
now
it
no
use
talking
about
but
you
crazy
man
you
crazy
one
man
alone
ca
buck
the
system
like
that
can
he
henslowe
walters
was
talking
earnestly
leaning
across
the
table
beside
the
lamp
henslowe
who
sat
very
stiff
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
nodded
with
compressed
lips
andrews
lay
at
full
length
on
the
bed
out
of
the
circle
of
light
honestly
andy
said
henslowe
with
tears
in
his
voice
i
think
better
do
what
walters
says
it
no
use
being
heroic
about
i
not
being
heroic
henny
cried
andrews
sitting
up
on
the
bed
he
drew
his
feet
under
him
tailor
fashion
and
went
on
talking
very
quietly
it
a
purely
personal
matter
i
got
to
a
point
where
i
do
give
a
damn
what
happens
to
me
i
do
care
if
i
shot
or
if
i
live
to
be
eighty
i
sick
of
being
ordered
round
one
more
order
shouted
at
my
head
is
not
worth
living
to
be
eighty
to
me
that
all
for
god
sake
let
talk
about
something
but
how
many
orders
have
you
had
shouted
at
your
head
since
you
got
in
this
school
detachment
not
one
you
can
put
through
your
discharge
application
probably
walters
got
to
his
feet
letting
the
chair
crash
to
the
floor
behind
him
he
stopped
to
pick
it
up
look
here
here
my
proposition
he
went
on
i
do
think
you
are
marked
in
the
school
office
things
are
so
damn
badly
run
there
you
can
turn
up
and
say
you
been
sick
and
draw
your
back
pay
and
nobody
say
a
thing
or
else
i
put
it
right
up
to
the
guy
who
top
sergeant
he
a
good
friend
of
mine
we
can
fix
it
up
on
the
records
some
way
but
for
god
sake
do
ruin
your
whole
life
on
account
of
a
little
stubbornness
and
some
damn
fool
anarchistic
ideas
or
other
a
feller
like
you
ought
to
have
had
more
sense
than
to
pick
up
he
right
andy
said
henslowe
in
a
low
voice
please
do
talk
any
more
about
it
you
told
me
all
that
before
said
andrews
sharply
he
threw
himself
back
on
the
bed
and
rolled
over
towards
the
wall
they
were
silent
a
long
time
a
sound
of
voices
and
footsteps
drifted
up
from
the
courtyard
but
look
here
andy
said
henslowe
nervously
stroking
his
moustache
you
care
much
more
about
your
work
than
any
abstract
idea
of
asserting
your
right
of
individual
liberty
even
if
you
do
get
caught
i
think
the
chances
of
getting
caught
are
mighty
slim
if
you
use
your
head
but
even
if
you
do
you
have
enough
money
to
live
for
long
over
here
you
have
do
you
think
i
thought
of
all
that
i
not
crazy
you
know
figured
up
the
balance
perfectly
sanely
the
only
thing
is
you
fellows
ca
understand
have
you
ever
been
in

thing
that
andrews
lay
on
his
back
talking
towards
the
ceiling
henslowe
was
on
his
feet
striding
nervously
about
the
room
as
if
anyone
was
ever
free
he
muttered
all
right
quibble
quibble

argue
anything
away

of

the
best
policy
necessary
for

man

the
most
cowardly

shrill
and
excited

occasionally
like
a
boy
voice

andrews
laughed
excitedly

but
there
nothing
i
can
do
everybody
got
to
settle
their
own
affairs
in
their
own
damn
fool
way
so
long
walters
and
henslowe
shook
hands
absently
henslowe
came
over
to
the
bed
and
held
out
his
hand
to
andrews
look

said
andrews
sitting
up
and
taking
henslowe
hand
they
heard
henslowe
steps
fade
down
the
stairs
and
then
ring
for
a
moment
on
the
pavings
of
the
courtyard
walters
moved
his
chair
over
beside
andrews
bed
now
look
let
have
a
talk
andrews
even
if
you
want
to
ruin
your
life
you
have
a
right
to
there
your
family
and
you
any
patriotism
remember
there
is
such
a
thing
as
duty
in
the
andrews
sat
up
and
said
in
a
low
furious
voice
pausing
between
each
word
i
ca
explain
it
but
i
shall
never
put
a
uniform
on
again
so
for
christ
sake
shut
all
right
do
what
you
goddam
please
i
through
with
walters
suddenly
flashed
into
a
rage
he
began
undressing
silently
andrews
lay
a
long
while
flat
on
his
back
in
the
bed
staring
at
the
ceiling
then
he
too
undressed
put
the
light
out
and
got
into
bed
the
rue
des
was
a
short
street
in
a
district
of
warehouses
a
grey
windowless
wall
shut
out
the
light
along
all
of
one
side
opposite
was
a
cluster
of
three
old
houses
leaning
together
as
if
the
outer
ones
were
trying
to
support
the
beetling
mansard
roof
of
the
center
house
behind
them
rose
a
huge
building
with
rows
and
rows
of
black
windows
when
andrews
stopped
to
look
about
him
he
found
the
street
completely
deserted
the
ominous
stillness
that
had
brooded
over
the
city
during
all
the
walk
from
his
room
near
the
pantheon
seemed
here
to
culminate
in
sheer
desolation
in
the
silence
he
could
hear
the
light
padding
noise
made
by
the
feet
of
a
dog
that
trotted
across
the
end
of
the
street
the
house
with
the
mansard
roof
was
number
eight
the
front
of
the
lower
storey
had
once
been
painted
in
across
the
top
of
which
was
still
decipherable
the
sign
charbon
bois
on
the
grimed
window
beside
the
door
was
painted
in
white
debit
de
andrews
pushed
on
the
door
which
opened
easily
somewhere
in
the
interior
a
bell
jangled
startlingly
loud
after
the
silence
of
the
street
on
the
wall
opposite
the
door
was
a
speckled
mirror
with
a
crack
in
it
the
shape
of
a
star
and
under
it
a
bench
with
three
tables
the
zinc
bar
filled
up
the
third
wall
in
the
fourth
was
a
glass
door
pasted
up
with
newspapers
andrews
walked
over
to
the
bar
the
jangling
of
the
bell
faded
to
silence
he
waited
a
curious
uneasiness
gradually
taking
possession
of
him
anyways
he
thought
he
was
wasting
his
time
he
ought
to
be
doing
something
to
arrange
his
future
he
walked
over
to
the
street
door
the
bell
jangled
again
when
he
opened
it
at
the
same
moment
a
man
came
out
through
the
door
the
newspapers
were
pasted
over
he
was
a
stout
man
in
a
dirty
white
shirt
stained
to
a
brownish
color
round
the
armpits
and
caught
in
very
tightly
at
the
waist
by
the
broad
elastic
belt
that
held
up
his
yellow
corduroy
trousers
his
face
was
flabby
of
a
greenish
color
black
eyes
looked
at
andrews
fixedly
through
barely
open
lids
so
that
they
seemed
long
slits
above
the
cheekbones
that
the
chink
thought
andrews
well
said
the
man
taking
his
place
behind
the
bar
with
his
legs
far
apart
a
beer
please
said
andrews
there
is
a
glass
of
wine
the
man
nodded
his
head
and
keeping
his
eyes
fastened
on
andrews
all
the
while
strode
out
of
the
door
again
a
moment
later
chrisfield
came
out
with
rumpled
hair
yawning
rubbing
an
eye
with
the
knuckles
of
one
fist
lawsie
ah
juss
woke
up
andy
come
along
in
andrews
followed
him
through
a
small
room
with
tables
and
benches
down
a
corridor
where
the
reek
of
ammonia
bit
into
his
eyes
and
up
a
staircase
littered
with
dirt
and
garbage
chrisfield
opened
a
door
directly
on
the
stairs
and
they
stumbled
into
a
large
room
with
a
window
that
gave
on
the
court
chrisfield
closed
the
door
carefully
and
turned
to
andrews
with
a
smile
ah

find
it
so
this
is
where
you

of
towelling

here
and
there
with
dried
blood
was
wrapped
round
his
head
and
a
hand
swathed
in
bandages
was
drawn
up
to
his
body
the
man
mouth
took
on
a
twisted
expression
of
pain
as
he
let
his
head
gradually
down
to
the
bed

chrisfield
followed

down

stairs
when

passage
at
the

of
the

put

cams
back
he
found

and
chrisfield
alone
in
their
room
chrisfield
was
walking
up
and
down
biting
his
finger
nails
on

he
a
powerful
ambitious
kid

but
it
not
the
sort
of
thing
a
man
can
make
good
in
al
said
andrews
slowly
they
were
silent
there
was
no
sound
in
the
courtyard
only
very
far
away
the
clatter
of
a
patrol
of
cavalry
over
cobblestones
the
sky
had
become
overcast
and
the
room
was
very
dark
the
mouldy
plaster
peeling
off
the
walls
had
streaks
of
green
in
it
the
light
from
the
courtyard
had
a
greenish
tinge
that
made
their
faces
look
pale
and
dead
like
the
faces
of
men
that
have
long
been
shut
up
between
damp
prison
walls
and
fuselli
had
a
girl
named
mabe
said
andrews
oh
she
married
a
guy
in
the
naval
reserve
they
had
a
grand
wedding
said
al
iv
at
last
i
got
to
you
john
andrews
had
caught
sight
of
genevieve
on
a
bench
at
the
end
of
the
garden
under
an
arbor
of
vines
her
hair
flamed
bright
in
a
splotch
of
sun
as
she
got
to
her
feet
she
held
out
both
hands
to
him
how
you
are
like
that
she
cried
he
was
conscious
only
of
her
hands
in
his
hands
and
of
her
eyes
and
of
the
bright
and
the
green
shadows
fluttering
all
about
them
so
you
are
out
of
prison
she
said
and
demobilized
how
wonderful
why
did
you
write
i
have
been
very
uneasy
about
you
how
did
you
find
me
here
your
mother
said
you
were
and
how
do
you
like
it
my
poissac
she
made
a
wide
gesture
with
her
hand
they
stood
silent
a
moment
side
by
side
looking
about
them
in
front
of
the
arbor
was
a
parterre
of
rounded
edging
beds
where
disorderly
roses
hung
in
clusters
of
pink
and
purple
and
and
beyond
it
a
brilliant
emerald
lawn
full
of
daisies
sloped
down
to
an
old
grey
house
with
at
one
end
a
squat
round
tower
that
had
an
roof
beyond
the
house
were
tall
poplars
through
which
glittered
patches
of
river
and
of
yellow
sand
banks
from
somewhere
came
a
drowsy
scent
of
mown
grass
how
brown
you
are
she
said
again
i
thought
i
had
lost
you
you
might
kiss
me
the
muscles
of
his
arms
tightened
about
her
shoulders
her
hair
flamed
in
his
eyes
the
wind
that
rustled
through
broad
made
a
flutter
of
dancing
light
and
shadow
about
them
how
hot
you
are
with
the
sun
she
said
i
love
the
smell
of
the
sweat
of
your
body
you
must
have
run
very
hard
coming
do
you
remember
one
night
in
the
spring
we
walked
home
from
pelleas
and
melisande
how
i
should
have
liked
to
have
kissed
you
then
like
this
andrews
voice
was
strange
hoarse
as
if
he
spoke
with
difficulty
there
is
the
chateau
tres
froid
et
tres
profond
she
said
with
a
little
laugh
and
your
hair
les
tiens
dans
les
doits
je
les
tiens
dans
la
bouche
toute
ta
chevelure
toute
ta
chevelure
melisande
est
tombee
de
la
tour
remember
how
wonderful
you
they
sat
side
by
side
on
the
stone
bench
without
touching
each
other
it
silly
burst
out
andrews
excitedly
we
should
have
faith
in
our
own
selves
we
ca
live
a
little
rag
of
romance
without
dragging
in
literature
we
are
drugged
with
literature
so
that
we
can
never
live
at
all
of
jean
how
did
you
come
down
here
have
you
been
demobilized
long
i
walked
almost
all
the
way
from
paris
you
see
i
am
very
how
wonderful
but
i
be
quiet
you
must
tell
me
everything
from
the
moment
you
left
me
in
i
tell
you
about
chartres
later
said
andrews
gruffly
it
has
been
superb
one
of
the
biggest
weeks
in
my
life
walking
all
day
under
the
sun
with
the
road
like
a
white
ribbon
in
the
sun
over
the
hills
and
along
river
banks
where
there
were
yellow
irises
blooming
and
through
woods
full
of
blackbirds
and
with
the
dust
in
a
little
white
cloud
round
my
feet
and
all
the
time
walking
towards
you
walking
towards
and
la
reine
de
saba
how
is
it
coming
i
do
know
it
a
long
time
since
i
thought
of
it
you
have
been
here
long
hardly
a
week
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
have
a
room
overlooking
the
river
in
a
house
owned
by
a
very
fat
woman
with
a
very
red
face
and
a
tuft
of
hair
on
her
chin
madame
of
course
you
must
know
everybody
it
so
and
you
going
to
stay
here
a
long
time
almost
forever
and
work
and
talk
to
you
may
i
use
your
piano
now
and
then
how
wonderful
genevieve
rod
jumped
to
her
feet
then
she
stood
looking
at
him
leaning
against
one
of
the
twisted
stems
of
the
vines
so
that
the
broad
leaves
fluttered
about
her
face
a
white
cloud
bright
as
silver
covered
the
sun
so
that
the
hairy
young
leaves
and
the
grass
of
the
lawn
took
on
a
silvery
sheen
two
white
butterflies
fluttered
for
a
second
about
the
arbor
you
must
always
dress
like
that
she
said
after
a
while
andrews
laughed
a
little
cleaner
i
hope
he
said
but
there
ca
be
much
change
i
have
no
other
clothes
and
ridiculously
little
who
cares
for
money
cried
genevieve
andrews
fancied
he
detected
a
slight
affectation
in
her
tone
but
he
drove
the
idea
from
his
mind
immediately
i
wonder
if
there
is
a
farm
round
here
where
i
could
get
but
you
could
do
the
work
of
a
farm
labourer
cried
genevieve
laughing
you
just
watch
it
spoil
your
hands
for
the
i
do
care
about
that
but
all
that
later
much
later
before
anything
else
i
must
finish
a
thing
i
am
working
on
there
is
a
theme
that
came
to
me
when
i
was
first
in
the
army
when
i
was
washing
windows
at
the
training
how
funny
you
are
jean
oh
it
lovely
to
have
you
about
again
but
you
awfully
solemn
today
perhaps
it
because
i
made
you
kiss
but
genevieve
it
not
in
one
day
that
you
can
unbend
a
slave
back
but
with
you
in
this
wonderful
place
oh
i
never
seen
such
sappy
richness
of
vegetation
and
think
of
it
a
week
walking
first
across
those
grey
rolling
uplands
and
then
at
blois
down
into
the
haze
of
richness
of
the
loire
know
vendome
i
came
by
a
funny
little
town
from
vendome
to
blois
you
see
my
feet
and
what
wonderful
cold
baths
i
had
on
the
sand
banks
of
the
loire
no
after
a
while
the
rhythm
of
legs
all
being
made
the
same
length
on
drill
fields
the
hopeless
caged
dullness
will
be
buried
deep
in
me
by
the
gorgeousness
of
this
world
of
yours
he
got
to
his
feet
and
crushed
a
leaf
softly
between
his
fingers
you
see
the
little
grapes
are
already
forming
look
up
there
she
said
as
she
brushed
the
leaves
aside
just
above
his
head
these
grapes
here
are
the
earliest
but
i
must
show
you
my
domain
and
my
cousins
and
the
hen
yard
and
she
took
his
hand
and
pulled
him
out
of
the
arbor
they
ran
like
children
hand
in
hand
round
the
paths
what
i
mean
is
this
he
stammered
following
her
across
the
lawn
if
i
could
once
manage
to
express
all
that
misery
in
music
i
could
shove
it
far
down
into
my
memory
i
should
be
free
to
live
my
own
existence
in
the
midst
of
this
carnival
of
at
the
house
she
turned
to
him
you
see
the
very
battered
ladies
over
the
door
she
said
they
are
said
to
be
by
a
pupil
of
jean
they
fit
wonderfully
in
the
landscape
do
they
did
i
ever
tell
you
about
the
sculptures
in
the
hospital
where
i
was
when
i
was
wounded
no
but
i
want
you
to
look
at
the
house
now
see
that
the
tower
all
that
left
of
the
old
building
i
live
there
and
right
under
the
roof
there
a
haunted
room
i
used
to
be
terribly
afraid
of
i
still
afraid
of
it
you
see
this
henri
quatre
part
of
the
house
was
just
a
fourth
of
the
house
as
planned
this
lawn
would
have
been
the
court
we
dug
up
foundations
where
the
roses
are
there
are
all
sorts
of
traditions
as
to
why
the
house
was
never
you
must
tell
me
i
shall
later
but
now
you
must
come
and
meet
my
aunt
and

like

much
to

or

to

but
ca
you

said
genevieve
flushing
her
hand
on
the
iron
latch
of
the
door
ca
i
come
to
see
you
tomorrow
morning
then
i
shall
feel
more
like
meeting
people
after
talking
to
you
a
long
while
you
see
i
he
paused
with
his
eyes
on
the
ground
then
he
burst
out
in
a
low
passionate
voice
oh
if
i
could
only
get
it
out
of
my
mind
those
tramping
feet
those
voices
shouting
his
hand
trembled
when
he
put
it
in
genevieve
hand
she
looked
in
his
eyes
calmly
with
her
wide
brown
eyes
how
strange
you
are
today
jean
anyway
come
back
early
she
went
in
the
door
he
walked
round
the
house
through
the
carriage
gate
and
went
off
with
long
strides
down
the
road
along
the
river
that
led
under
linden
trees
to
the
village
thoughts
swarmed
teasingly
through
his
head
like
wasps
about
a
rotting
fruit
so
at
last
he
had
seen
genevieve
and
had
held
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
and
that
was
all
his
plans
for
the
future
had
never
gone
beyond
that
point
he
hardly
knew
what
he
had
expected
but
in
all
the
sunny
days
of
walking
in
all
the
furtive
days
in
paris
he
had
thought
of
nothing
else
he
would
see
genevieve
and
tell
her
all
about
himself
he
would
unroll
his
life
like
a
scroll
before
her
eyes
together
they
would
piece
together
the
future
a
sudden
terror
took
possession
of
him
she
had
failed
him
floods
of
denial
seethed
through
his
mind
it
was
that
he
had
expected
so
much
he
had
expected
her
to
understand
him
without
explanation
instinctively
he
had
told
her
nothing
he
had
not
even
told
her
he
was
a
deserter
what
was
it
that
had
kept
him
from
telling
her
puzzle
as
he
would
he
could
not
formulate
it
only
far
within
him
the
certainty
lay
like
an
icy
weight
she
had
failed
him
he
was
alone
what
a
fool
he
had
been
to
build
his
whole
life
on
a
chance
of
sympathy
no
it
was
rather
this
morbid
playing
at
phrases
that
was
at
fault
he
was
like
a
touchy
old
maid
thinking
imaginary
results
take
life
at
its
face
value
he
kept
telling
himself
they
loved
each
other
anyway
somehow
it
did
not
matter
how
and
he
was
free
to
work
was
that
enough
but
how
could
he
wait
until
tomorrow
to
see
her
to
tell
her
everything
to
break
down
all
the
silly
little
barriers
between
them
so
that
they
might
look
directly
into
each
other
lives
the
road
turned
inland
from
the
river
between
garden
walls
at
the
entrance
to
the
village
through
doors
andrews
got
glimpses
of
and
orchards
where
boughs
swayed
against
the
sky
then
the
road
swerved
again
into
the
village
crowded
into
a
narrow
paved
street
by
the
white
and
houses
with
green
or
grey
shutters
and
pale
roofs
at
the
end
stained
golden
with
lichen
the
tower
of
the
church
held
up
its
bells
against
the
sky
in
a
belfry
of
broad
pointed
arches
in
front
of
the
church
andrews
turned
down
a
little
lane
towards
the
river
again
to
come
out
in
a
moment
on
a
quay
shaded
by
skinny
acacia
trees
on
the
corner
house
a
ramshackle
house
with
roofs
and
gables
projecting
in
all
directions
was
a
sign
rendezvous
de
la
the
room
he
stepped
into
was
so
low
andrews
had
to
stoop
under
the
heavy
brown
beams
as
he
crossed
it
stairs
went
up
from
a
door
behind
a
worn
billiard
table
in
the
corner
mme
boncour
stood
between
andrews
and
the
stairs
she
was
a
flabby
elderly
woman
with
round
eyes
and
a
round
very
red
face
and
a
curious
smirk
about
the
lips
monsieur
payera
un
petit
peu
pas
monsieur
all
right
said
andrews
reaching
for
his
pocketbook
shall
i
pay
you
a
week
in
advance
the
woman
smiled
broadly
si
monsieur
desire
it
that
life
is
so
dear
nowadays
poor
people
like
us
can
barely
get
i
know
that
only
too
well
said
andrews
monsieur
est
etranger
began
the
woman
in
a
wheedling
tone
when
she
had
received
the
money
yes
i
was
only
demobilized
a
short
time
aha
monsieur
est
demobilise
monsieur
remplira
la
petite
feuille
pour
la
police
pas
the
woman
brought
from
behind
her
back
a
hand
that
held
a
narrow
printed
slip
all
right
i
fill
it
out
now
said
andrews
his
heart
thumping
without
thinking
what
he
was
doing
he
put
the
paper
on
the
edge
of
the
billiard
table
and
wrote
john
brown
aged
chicago
musician
holder
of
passport
no
merci
monsieur
a
bientot
monsieur
au
revoir
the
woman
singing
voice
followed
him
up
the
rickety
stairs
to
his
room
it
was
only
when
he
had
closed
the
door
that
he
remembered
that
he
had
put
down
for
a
passport
number
his
army
number
and
why
did
i
write
john
brown
as
a
name
he
asked
himself
john
brown
body
lies
in
the
grave
but
his
soul
goes
marching
on
glory
glory
hallelujah
but
his
soul
goes
marching
he
heard
the
song
so
vividly
that
he
thought
for
an
instant
someone
must
be
standing
beside
him
singing
it
he
went
to
the
window
and
ran
his
hand
through
his
hair
outside
the
loire
rambled
in
great
loops
towards
the
blue
distance
silvery
reach
upon
silvery
reach
with
here
and
there
the
broad
gleam
of
a
sand
bank
opposite
were
poplars
and
fields
patched
in
various
greens
rising
to
hills
tufted
with
dense
shadowy
groves
on
the
bare
summit
of
the
highest
hill
a
windmill
waved
lazy
arms
against
the
marbled
sky
gradually
john
andrews
felt
the
silvery
quiet
settle
about
him
he
pulled
a
sausage
and
a
piece
of
bread
out
of
the
pocket
of
his
coat
took
a
long
swig
of
water
from
the
pitcher
on
his
washstand
and
settled
himself
at
the
table
before
the
window
in
front
of
a
pile
of
ruled
sheets
of
music
paper
he
nibbled
the
bread
and
the
sausage
meditatively
for
a
long
while
then
wrote
arbeit
und
rhythmus
in
a
large
careful
hand
at
the
top
of
the
paper
after
that
he
looked
out
of
the
window
without
moving
watching
the
plumed
clouds
sail
like
huge
slow
ships
against
the
sky
suddenly
he
scratched
out
what
he
had
written
and
scrawled
above
it
the
body
and
soul
of
john
he
got
to
his
feet
and
walked
about
the
room
with
clenched
hands
how
curious
that
i
should
have
written
that
name
how
curious
that
i
should
have
written
that
name
he
said
aloud
he
sat
down
at
the
table
again
and
forgot
everything
in
the
music
that
possessed
him
the
next
morning
he
walked
out
early
along
the
river
trying
to
occupy
himself
until
it
should
be
time
to
go
to
see
genevieve
the
memory
of
his
first
days
in
the
army
spent
washing
windows
at
the
training
camp
was
very
vivid
in
his
mind
he
saw
himself
again
standing
naked
in
the
middle
of
a
wide
bare
room
while
the
recruiting
sergeant
measured
and
prodded
him
and
now
he
was
a
deserter
was
there
any
sense
to
it
all
had
his
life
led
in
any
particular
direction
since
he
had
been
caught
haphazard
in
the
treadmill
or
was
it
all
chance
a
toad
hopping
across
a
road
in
front
of
a
steam
roller
he
stood
still
and
looked
about
him
beyond
a
clover
field
was
the
river
with
its
sand
banks
and
its
broad
silver
reaches
a
boy
was
wading
far
out
in
the
river
catching
minnows
with
a
net
andrews
watched
his
quick
movements
as
he
jerked
the
net
through
the
water
and
that
boy
too
would
be
a
soldier
the
lithe
body
would
be
thrown
into
a
mould
to
be
made
the
same
as
other
bodies
the
quick
movements
would
be
standardized
into
the
manual
at
arms
the
inquisitive
petulant
mind
would
be
battered
into
servility
the
stockade
was
built
not
one
of
the
sheep
would
escape
and
those
that
were
not
sheep
they
were
deserters
every
rifle
muzzle
held
death
for
them
they
would
not
live
long
and
yet
other
nightmares
had
been
thrown
off
the
shoulders
of
men
every
man
who
stood
up
courageously
to
die
loosened
the
grip
of
the
nightmare
andrews
walked
slowly
along
the
road
kicking
his
feet
into
the
dust
like
a
schoolboy
at
a
turning
he
threw
himself
down
on
the
grass
under
some
locust
trees
the
heavy
fragrance
of
their
flowers
and
the
grumbling
of
the
bees
that
hung
drunkenly
on
the
white
racemes
made
him
feel
very
drowsy
a
cart
passed
pulled
by
heavy
white
horses
an
old
man
with
his
back
curved
like
the
top
of
a
sunflower
stalk
hobbled
after
using
the
whip
as
a
walking
stick
andrews
saw
the
old
man
eyes
turned
on
him
suspiciously
a
faint
pang
of
fright
went
through
him
did
the
old
man
know
he
was
a
deserter
the
cart
and
the
old
man
had
already
disappeared
round
the
bend
in
the
road
andrews
lay
a
long
while
listening
to
the
jingle
of
the
harness
thin
into
the
distance
leaving
him
again
to
the
sound
of
the
drowsy
bees
among
the
locust
blossoms
when
he
sat
up
he
noticed
that
through
a
break
in
the
hedge
beyond
the
slender
black
trunks
of
the
locusts
he
could
see
rising
above
the
trees
the
roof
of
the
tower
of
genevieve
rod
house
he
remembered
the
day
he
had
first
seen
genevieve
and
the
boyish
awkwardness
with
which
she
poured
tea
would
he
and
genevieve
ever
find
a
moment
of
real
contact
all
at
once
a
bitter
thought
came
to
him
or
is
it
that
she
wants
a
tame
pianist
as
an
ornament
to
a
clever
young
woman
drawing
room
he
jumped
to
his
feet
and
started
walking
fast
towards
the
town
again
he
would
go
to
see
her
at
once
and
settle
all
that
forever
the
village
clock
had
begun
to
strike
the
clear
notes
vibrated
crisply
across
the
fields
ten
walking
back
to
the
village
he
began
to
think
of
money
his
room
was
twenty
francs
a
week
he
had
in
his
purse
a
hundred
and
francs
after
fishing
in
all
his
pockets
for
silver
he
found
three
francs
and
a
half
more
a
hundred
and
francs
fifty
if
he
could
live
on
forty
francs
a
week
he
would
have
three
weeks
in
which
to
work
on
the
body
and
soul
of
john
only
three
weeks
and
then
he
must
find
work
in
any
case
he
would
write
henslowe
to
send
him
money
if
he
had
any
this
was
no
time
for
delicacy
everything
depended
on
his
having
money
and
he
swore
to
himself
that
he
would
work
for
three
weeks
that
he
would
throw
the
idea
that
flamed
within
him
into
shape
on
paper
whatever
happened
he
racked
his
brains
to
think
of
someone
in
america
he
could
write
to
for
money
a
ghastly
sense
of
solitude
possessed
him
and
would
genevieve
fail
him
too
genevieve
was
coming
out
by
the
front
door
of
the
house
when
he
reached
the
carriage
gate
beside
the
road
she
ran
to
meet
him
good
morning
i
was
on
my
way
to
fetch
she
seized
his
hand
and
pressed
it
hard
how
sweet
of
you

jean

from
the

how
early

up

see
the
sun
rises
just
opposite
my
window
and
shines
in
on
my
bed
that
makes
me
get
up
she
pushed
him
in
the
door
ahead
of
her
they
went
through
the
hall
to
a
long
high
room
that
had
a
grand
piano
and
many
old
chairs
and
in
front
of
the
french
windows
that
opened
on
the
garden
a
round
table
of
black
mahogany
littered
with
books
two
tall
girls
in
muslin
dresses
stood
beside
the
piano
these
are
my
cousins
here
he
is

last

said
andrews
in
a
low
voice
genevieve
nodded
understandingly

corner
cried
genevieve
it
ridiculous
everything

the
house
is
jammed
with
they
leaned
over
the
chest
together
so
that
andrews
felt
her
hair
brush
against
his
cheek
and
the
smell
of
her
hair
in
his
nostrils
the
cousins
remained
by
the
piano
i
must
talk
to
you
alone
soon
whispered
andrews
all
right
she
said
her
face
reddening
as
she
leaned
over
the
chest
on
top
of
the
music
was
a
revolver
look
out
it
loaded
she
said
when
he
picked
it
up
he
looked
at
her
inquiringly

my
room

i

said
suddenly
lend
me
that
revolver
for
a
few
days
i
tell
you
why
i
want
it
certainly
be
careful
because
it
loaded
she
said
in
an
offhand
manner
walking
over
to
the
piano
with
two
volumes
under
each
arm
andrews
closed
the
chest
and
followed
her
suddenly
bubbling
with
gaiety
he
opened
a
volume
haphazard
to
a
friend
to
dissuade
him
from
starting
on
a
journey
he
read
oh
i
used
to
know
he
began
to
play
putting
boisterous
vigor
into
the
tunes
in
a
pianissimo
passage
he
heard
one
cousin
whisper
to
the
other
a
farouche
pas
genre
revolutionnaire
answered
the
other
cousin
tittering
then
he
noticed
that
mme
rod
was
smiling
at
him
he
got
to
his
feet
mais
ne
vous
derangez
pas
she
said
a
man
with
white
flannel
trousers
and
tennis
shoes
and
a
man
in
black
with
a
pointed
grey
beard
and
amused
grey
eyes
had
come
into
the
room
followed
by
a
stout
woman
in
hat
and
veil
with
long
white
cotton
gloves
on
her
arms
introductions
were
made
andrews
spirits
began
to
ebb
all
these
people
were
making
strong
the
barrier
between
him
and
genevieve
whenever
he
looked
at
her
some
person
stepped
in
front
of
her
with
a
gesture
of
politeness
he
felt
caught
in
a
ring
of
conventions
that
danced
about
him
with
grotesque
gestures
of
politeness
all
through
lunch
he
had
a
crazy
desire
to
jump
to
his
feet
and
shout
look
at
me
i
a
deserter
i
under
the
wheels
of
your
system
if
your
system
does
succeed
in
killing
me
it
will
be
that
much
weaker
it
will
have
less
strength
to
kill
there
was
talk
about
his
demobilization
and
his
music
and
the
schola
cantorum
he
felt
he
was
being
exhibited
but
they
do
know
what
exhibiting
he
said
to
himself
with
a
certain
bitter
joy
after
lunch
they
went
out
into
the
grape
arbor
where
coffee
was
brought
andrews
sat
silent
not
listening
to
the
talk
which
was
about
empire
furniture
and
the
new
taxes
staring
up
into
the
broad
leaves
of
the
grape
vines
remembering
how
the
sun
and
shade
had
danced
about
genevieve
hair
when
they
had
been
in
the
arbor
alone
the
day
before
turning
it
all
to
red
flame
today
she
sat
in
shadow
and
her
hair
was
rusty
and
dull
time
dragged
by
very
slowly
at
last
genevieve
got
to
her
feet
you
have
seen
my
boat
she
said
to
andrews
let
go
for
a
row
i
row
you
andrews
jumped
up
eagerly
make
her
be
careful
monsieur
andrews
she
dreadfully
imprudent
said
madame
rod
you
were
bored
to
death
said
genevieve
as
they
walked
out
on
the
road
no
but
those
people
all
seemed
to
be
building
new
walls
between
you
and
me
god
knows
there
are
enough
she
looked
him
sharply
in
the
eyes
a
second
but
said
nothing
they
walked
slowly
through
the
sand
of
the
river
edge
till
they
came
to
an
old
boat
painted
green
with
an
orange
stripe
drawn
up
among
the
reeds
it
will
probably
sink
can
you
swim
she
asked
laughing
andrews
smiled
and
said
in
a
stiff
voice
i
can
swim
it
was
by
swimming
that
i
got
out
of
the
what
do
you
mean
when
i
when
you
deserted
genevieve
leaned
over
to
pull
on
the
boat
their
heads
almost
touching
they
pulled
the
boat
down
to
the
water
edge
then
pushed
it
half
out
on
to
the
river
and
if
you
are
caught
they
might
shoot
me
i
do
know
still
as
the
war
is
over
it
would
probably
be
life
imprisonment
or
at
least
twenty
you
can
speak
of
it
as
coolly
as
that
it
is
no
new
idea
to
my
what
induced
you
to
do
such
a
thing
i
was
not
willing
to
submit
any
longer
to
the
come
let
go
out
on
the
genevieve
stepped
into
the
boat
and
caught
up
the
oars
now
push
her
off
and
do
fall
in
she
cried
the
boat
glided
out
into
the
water
genevieve
began
pulling
on
the
oars
slowly
and
regularly
andrews
looked
at
her
without
speaking
when
you
tired
i
row
he
said
after
a
while
behind
them
the
village
patched
white
and
and
russet
and
pale
red
with
stucco
walls
and
steep
tiled
roofs
rose
in
an
irregular
pyramid
to
the
church
through
the
wide
pointed
arches
of
the
belfry
they
could
see
the
bells
hanging
against
the
sky
below
in
the
river
the
town
was
reflected
complete
with
a
great
rift
of
steely
blue
across
it
where
the
wind
ruffled
the
water
the
oars
creaked
rhythmically
as
genevieve
pulled
on
them
remember
when
you
are
tired
said
andrews
again
after
a
long
pause
genevieve
spoke
through
clenched
teeth
of
course
you
have
no
as
you
mean
it
they
rounded
the
edge
of
a
sand
bank
where
the
current
ran
hard
andrews
put
his
hands
beside
her
hands
on
the
oars
and
pushed
with
her
the
bow
of
the
boat
grounded
in
some
reeds
under
willows
we
stay
here
she
said
pulling
in
the
oars
that
flashed
in
the
sun
as
she
jerked
them
dripping
silver
out
of
the
water
she
clasped
her
hands
round
her
knees
and
leaned
over
towards
him
so
that
is
why
you
want
my
revolver
tell
me
all
about
it
from
chartres
she
said
in
a
choked
voice
you
see
i
was
arrested
at
chartres
and
sent
to
a
labor
battalion
the
equivalent
for
your
army
prison
without
being
able
to
get
word
to
my
commanding
officer
in
the
school
detachment
he
paused
a
bird
was
singing
in
the
willow
tree
the
sun
was
under
a
cloud
beyond
the
long
pale
green
leaves
that
fluttered
ever
so
slightly
in
the
wind
the
sky
was
full
of
silvery
and
clouds
with
here
and
there
a
patch
the
color
of
a
robin
egg
andrews
began
laughing
softly
but
genevieve
how
silly
those
words
are
those
pompous
efficient
words
detachment
battalion
commanding
officer
it
would
have
all
happened
anyway
things
reached
the
breaking
point
that
was
all
i
could
not
submit
any
longer
to
the
discipline
oh
those
long
roman
words
what
millstones
they
are
about
men
necks
that
was
silly
too
i
was
quite
willing
to
help
in
the
killing
of
germans
i
had
no
quarrel
with
out
of
curiosity
or
cowardice
you
see
it
has
taken
me
so
long
to
find
out
how
the
world
is
there
was
no
one
to
show
me
the
he
paused
as
if
expecting
her
to
speak
the
bird
in
the
willow
tree
was
still
singing
suddenly
a
dangling
twig
blew
aside
a
little
so
that
andrews
could
see
him
a
small
grey
bird
his
throat
all
puffed
out
with
song
it
seems
to
me
he
said
very
softly
that
human
society
has
been
always
that
and
perhaps
will
be
always
that
organizations
growing
and
stifling
individuals
and
individuals
revolting
hopelessly
against
them
and
at
last
forming
new
societies
to
crush
the
old
societies
and
becoming
slaves
again
in
their
turn
i
thought
you
were
a
socialist
broke
in
genevieve
sharply
in
a
voice
that
hurt
him
to
the
quick
he
did
not
know
why
a
man
told
me
at
the
labor
battalion
began
andrews
again
that
they
tortured
a
friend
of
his
there
once
by
making
him
swallow
lighted
cigarettes
well
every
order
shouted
at
me
every
new
humiliation
before
the
authorities
was
as
great
an
agony
to
me
ca
you
understand
his
voice
rose
suddenly
to
a
tone
of
entreaty
she
nodded
her
head
they
were
silent
the
willow
leaves
shivered
in
a
little
wind
the
bird
had
gone
but
tell
me
about
the
swimming
part
of
it
that
sounds
we
were
working
unloading
cement
at
passy
cement
to
build
the
stadium
the
army
is
presenting
to
the
french
built
by
slave
labor
like
the
passy
where
balzac
lived
have
you
ever
seen
his
house
there
there
was
a
boy
working
with
me
the
kid
gosse
it
be
in
french
without
him
i
should
never
have
done
it
i
was
completely
crushed
i
suppose
that
he
was
drowned
anyway
we
swam
under
water
as
far
as
we
could
and
as
it
was
nearly
dark
i
managed
to
get
on
a
barge
where
a
funny
anarchist
family
took
care
of
me
i
never
heard
of
the
kid
since
then
i
bought
these
clothes
that
amuse
you
so
genevieve
and
came
back
to
paris
to
find
you
i
mean
as
much
to
you
as
that
whispered
genevieve
in
paris
too
i
tried
to
find
a
boy
named
marcel
who
worked
on
a
farm
near
germain
i
met
him
out
there
one
day
i
found
he
gone
to
sea
if
it
had
not
been
that
i
had
to
see
you
i
should
have
gone
straight
to
bordeaux
or
marseilles
they
are
too
particular
who
they
take
as
a
seaman
but
in
the
army
did
you
have
enough
of
that
dreadful
life
always
thrown
among
uneducated
people
always
in
dirty
foulsmelling
surroundings
you
a
sensitive
person
an
artist
no
wonder
you
are
almost
crazy
after
years
of
genevieve
spoke
passionately
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
his
face
oh
it
was
that
said
andrews
with
despair
in
his
voice
i
rather
like
the
people
you
call
low
anyway
the
differences
between
people
are
so
slight
his
sentence
trailed
away
he
stopped
speaking
sat
stirring
uneasily
on
the
seat
afraid
he
would
cry
out
he
noticed
the
hard
shape
of
the
revolver
against
his
leg
but
is
there
something
you
can
do
about
it
you
must
have
friends
burst
out
genevieve
you
were
treated
with
horrible
injustice
you
can
get
yourself
reinstated
and
properly
demobilised
they
see
you
are
a
person
of
intelligence
they
ca
treat
you
as
they
would
i
must
be
as
you
say
a
little
mad
genevieve
said
andrews
but
now
that
i
by
pure
accident
have
made
a
gesture
feeble
as
it
is
towards
human
freedom
i
ca
feel
that
oh
i
suppose
i
a
fool
but
there
you
have
me
just
as
i
am
he
sat
with
his
head
drooping
over
his
chest
his
two
hands
clasping
the
gunwales
of
the
boat
after
a
long
while
genevieve
said
in
a
dry
little
voice
well
we
must
go
back
now
it
time
for
andrews
looked
up
there
was
a
dragon
fly
poised
on
the
top
of
a
reed
with
silver
wings
and
a
long
crimson
body
look
just
behind
you
oh
a
dragon
fly
what
people
was
it
that
made
them
the
symbol
of
life
it
was
the
egyptians
o
i
i
row
said
andrews
the
boat
was
hurried
along
by
the
current
in
a
very
few
minutes
they
had
pulled
it
up
on
the
bank
in
front
of
the
rods
house
come
and
have
some
tea
said
genevieve
no
i
must
you
are
doing
something
new
are
you
andrews
nodded
what
its
name
the
soul
and
body
of
john
who
john
brown
he
was
a
madman
who
wanted
to
free
people
there
a
song
about
it
is
based
on
popular
themes
not
that
i
know
of
i
only
thought
of
the
name
yesterday
it
came
to
me
by
a
very
curious
you
come
tomorrow
if
you
not
too
let
see
the
boileaus
are
coming
to
lunch
there
wo
be
anybody
at
tea
time
we
can
have
tea
together
he
took
her
hand
and
held
it
awkward
as
a
child
with
a
new
playmate
all
right
at
about
four
if
there
nobody
there
we
play
music
he
said
she
pulled
her
hand
from
him
hurriedly
made
a
curious
formal
gesture
of
farewell
and
crossed
the
road
to
the
gate
without
looking
back
there
was
one
idea
in
his
head
to
get
to
his
room
and
lock
the
door
and
throw
himself
face
down
on
the
bed
the
idea
amused
some
distant
part
of
his
mind
that
had
been
what
he
had
always
done
when
as
a
child
the
world
had
seemed
too
much
for
him
he
would
run
upstairs
and
lock
the
door
and
throw
himself
face
downward
on
the
bed
i
wonder
if
i
shall
cry
he
thought
madame
boncour
was
coming
down
the
stairs
as
he
went
up
he
backed
down
and
waited
when
she
got
to
the
bottom
pouting
a
little
she
said
so
you
are
a
friend
of
mme
rod
monsieur
how
did
you
know
that
a
dimple
appeared
near
her
mouth
in
either
cheek
you
know
in
the
country
one
knows
everything
she
said
au
revoir
he
said
starting
up
the
stairs
mais
monsieur
you
should
have
told
me
if
i
had
known
i
should
not
have
asked
you
to
pay
in
advance
oh
never
you
must
pardon
me
all
monsieur
est
americain
you
see
i
know
a
her
puffy
cheeks
shook
when
she
giggled
and
monsieur
has
known
mme
rod
et
mlle
rod
a
long
time
an
old
friend
monsieur
is
a
yes
bon
andrews
ran
up
the
stairs
au
revoir
her
chanting
voice
followed
him
up
the
stairs
he
slammed
the
door
behind
him
and
threw
himself
on
the
bed
when
andrews
awoke
next
morning
his
first
thought
was
how
long
he
had
to
wait
that
day
to
see
genevieve
then
he
remembered
their
talk
of
the
day
before
was
it
worth
while
going
to
see
her
at
all
he
asked
himself
and
very
gradually
he
felt
cold
despair
taking
hold
of
him
he
felt
for
a
moment
that
he
was
the
only
living
thing
in
a
world
of
dead
machines
the
toad
hopping
across
the
road
in
front
of
a
steam
roller
suddenly
he
thought
of
jeanne
he
remembered
her
grimy
overworked
fingers
lying
in
her
lap
he
pictured
her
walking
up
and
down
in
front
of
the
cafe
de
rohan
one
wednesday
night
waiting
for
him
in
the
place
of
genevieve
what
would
jeanne
have
done
yet
people
were
always
alone
really
however
much
they
loved
each
other
there
could
be
no
real
union
those
who
rode
in
the
great
car
could
never
feel
as
the
others
felt
the
toads
hopping
across
the
road
he
felt
no
rancour
against
genevieve
these
thoughts
slipped
from
him
while
he
was
drinking
the
coffee
and
eating
the
dry
bread
that
made
his
breakfast
and
afterwards
walking
back
and
forth
along
the
river
bank
he
felt
his
mind
and
body
becoming
as
if
fluid
and
supple
trembling
bent
in
the
rush
of
his
music
like
a
poplar
tree
bent
in
a
wind
he
sharpened
a
pencil
and
went
up
to
his
room
again
the
sky
was
cloudless
that
day
as
he
sat
at
his
table
the
square
of
blue
through
the
window
and
the
hills
topped
by
their
windmill
and
the
of
the
river
were
constantly
in
his
eyes
sometimes
he
wrote
notes
down
fast
thinking
nothing
feeling
nothing
seeing
nothing
other
times
he
sat
for
long
periods
staring
at
the
sky
and
at
the
windmill
vaguely
happy
playing
with
unexpected
thoughts
that
came
and
vanished
as
now
and
then
a
moth
fluttered
in
the
window
to
blunder
about
the
ceiling
beams
and
at
last
to
disappear
without
his
knowing
how
when
the
clock
struck
twelve
he
found
he
was
very
hungry
for
two
days
he
had
eaten
nothing
but
bread
sausage
and
cheese
finding
madame
boncour
behind
the
bar
downstairs
polishing
glasses
he
ordered
dinner
of
her
she
brought
him
a
stew
and
a
bottle
of
wine
at
once
and
stood
over
him
watching
him
eat
it
her
arms
akimbo
and
the
dimples
showing
in
her
huge
red
cheeks
monsieur
eats
less
than
any
young
man
i
ever
saw
she
said
i
working
hard
said
andrews
flushing
but
when
you
work
you
have
to
eat
a
great
deal
a
great
and
if
the
money
is
short
asked
andrews
with
a
smile
something
in
the
steely
searching
look
that
passed
over
her
eyes
for
a
minute
startled
him
there
are
not
many
people
here
now
monsieur
but
you
should
see
it
on
a
market
day
monsieur
will
take
some
dessert
cheese
and
nothing
more
it
the
season
of
nothing
more
thank
when
madame
boncour
came
back
with
the
cheese
she
said
i

americans

pretty
time
i
had
with
them
too
they
were
deserters
they
went
away
without
paying
with
the
gendarmes
after
them
i
hope
they
were
caught
and
sent
to
the
front
those
there
are
all
sorts
of
americans
said
andrews
in
a
low
voice
he
was
angry
with
himself
because
his
heart
beat
so
well
i
going
for
a
little
walk
au
revoir
monsieur
is
going
for
a
little
walk
bien
monsieur
au
revoir
monsieur
madame
boncour
singsong
tones
followed
him
out
a
little
before
four
andrews
knocked
at
the
front
door
of
the
house
he
could
hear
santo
the
little
black
and
tan
barking
inside
madame
rod
opened
the
door
for
him
herself
oh
here
you
are
she
said
come
and
have
some
tea
did
the
work
go
well
and
genevieve
stammered
andrews
she
went
out
motoring
with
some
friends
she
left
a
note
for
you
on
the
he
found
himself
talking
making
questions
and
answers
drinking
tea
putting
cakes
into
his
mouth
all
through
a
white
dead
mist
note
said
jean
i
thinking
of
ways
and
means
you
must
get
away
to
a
neutral
country
why
could
you
have
talked
it
over
with
me
first
before
cutting
off
every
chance
of
going
back
i
be
in
tomorrow
at
the
same
time
bien
a
vous
would
it
disturb
you
if
i
played
the
piano
a
few
minutes
madame
rod
andrews
found
himself
asking
all
at
once
no
go
ahead
we
come
in
later
and
listen
to
it
was
only
as
he
left
the
room
that
he
realized
he
had
been
talking
to
the
two
cousins
as
well
as
to
madame
rod
at
the
piano
he
forgot
everything
and
regained
his
mood
of
vague
joyousness
he
found
paper
and
a
pencil
in
his
pocket
and
played
the
theme
that
had
come
to
him
while
he
had
been
washing
windows
at
the
top
of
a
at
training
camp
arranging
it
modelling
it
forgetting
everything
absorbed
in
his
rhythms
and
cadences
when
he
stopped
work
it
was
nearly
dark
genevieve
rod
a
veil
round
her
head
stood
in
the
french
window
that
led
to
the
garden
i
heard
you
she
said
go
i
through
how
was
your
motor
ride
i
loved
it
it
not
often
i
get
a
chance
to
go
nor
is
it
often
i
get
a
chance
to
talk
to
you
alone
cried
andrews
bitterly
you
seem
to
feel
you
have
rights
of
ownership
over
me
i
resent
it
no
one
has
rights
over
she
spoke
as
if
it
were
not
the
first
time
she
had
thought
of
the
phrase
he
walked
over
and
leaned
against
the
window
beside
her
has
it
made
such
a
difference
to
you
genevieve
finding
out
that
i
am
a
deserter
no
of
course
not
she
said
hastily
i
think
it
has
genevieve
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
do
you
think
i
should
give
myself
up
a
man
i
knew
in
paris
has
given
himself
up
but
he
had
taken
his
uniform
off
it
seems
that
makes
a
difference
he
was
a
nice
fellow
his
name
was
al
he
was
from
san
francisco
he
had
nerve
for
he
amputated
his
own
little
finger
when
his
hand
was
crushed
by
a
freight
oh
no
no
oh
this
is
so
frightful
and
you
would
have
been
a
great
composer
i
feel
sure
of
why
would
have
been
the
stuff
i
doing
now
better
than
any
of
the
dribbling
things
i
done
before
i
know
oh
yes
but
you
need
to
study
to
get
yourself
if
i
can
pull
through
six
months
i
safe
the
army
will
have
gone
i
do
believe
they
extradite
yes
but
the
shame
of
it
the
danger
of
being
found
out
all
the
i
am
ashamed
of
many
things
in
my
life
genevieve
i
rather
proud
of
but
ca
you
understand
that
other
people
have
your
notions
of
individual
liberty
i
must
go
you
must
come
in
again
one
of
these
and
he
was
out
in
the
road
in
the
windy
twilight
with
his
music
papers
crumpled
in
his
hand
the
sky
was
full
of
tempestuous
purple
clouds
between
them
were
spaces
of
clear
light
and
here
and
there
a
gleam
of
opal
there
were
a
few
drops
of
rain
in
the
wind
that
rustled
the
broad
leaves
of
the
lindens
and
filled
the
wheat
fields
with
waves
like
the
sea
and
made
the
river
very
dark
between
rosy
sand
banks
it
began
to
rain
andrews
hurried
home
so
as
not
to
drench
his
only
suit
once
in
his
room
he
lit
four
candles
and
placed
them
at
the
corners
of
his
table
a
little
cold
crimson
light
still
filtered
in
through
the
rain
from
the
afterglow
giving
the
candles
a
ghostly
glimmer
then
he
lay
on
his
bed
and
staring
up
at
the
flickering
light
on
the
ceiling
tried
to
think
well
you
alone
now
john
andrews
he
said
aloud
after
a
and
jumped
jauntily
to
his
feet
he
stretched
himself
and
yawned
outside
the
rain
pattered
loudly
and
steadily
let
have
a
general
accounting
he
said
to
himself
it
be
easily
a
month
before
i
hear
from
old
howe
in
america
and
longer
before
i
hear
from
henslowe
and
already
i
spent
twenty
francs
on
food
ca
make
it
this
way
then
in
real
possessions
i
have
one
volume
of
villon
a
green
book
on
counterpoint
a
map
of
france
torn
in
two
and
a
moderately
he
put
the
two
books
on
the
middle
of
the
table
before
him
on
top
of
his
disorderly
bundle
of
music
papers
and
notebooks
then
he
went
on
piling
his
possessions
there
as
he
thought
of
them
three
pencils
a
fountain
pen
automatically
he
reached
for
his
watch
but
he
remembered
he
given
it
to
al
to
pawn
in
case
he
did
decide
to
give
himself
up
and
needed
money
a
toothbrush
a
shaving
set
a
piece
of
soap
a
hairbrush
and
a
broken
comb
anything
else
he
groped
in
the
musette
that
hung
on
the
foot
of
the
bed
a
box
of
matches
a
knife
with
one
blade
missing
and
a
mashed
cigarette
amusement
growing
on
him
every
minute
he
contemplated
the
pile
then
in
the
drawer
he
remembered
was
a
clean
shirt
and
two
pairs
of
soiled
socks
and
that
was
all
absolutely
all
nothing
saleable
there
except
genevieve
revolver
he
pulled
it
out
of
his
pocket
the
candlelight
flashed
on
the
bright
nickel
no
he
might
need
that
it
was
too
valuable
to
sell
he
pointed
it
towards
himself
under
the
chin
was
said
to
be
the
best
place
he
wondered
if
he
would
pull
the
trigger
when
the
barrel
was
pressed
against
his
chin
no
when
his
money
gave
out
he
sell
the
revolver
an
expensive
death
for
a
starving
man
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
laughed
then
he
discovered
he
was
very
hungry
two
meals
in
one
day
shocking
he
said
to
himself
whistling
joyfully
like
a
schoolboy
he
strode
down
the
rickety
stairs
to
order
a
meal
of
madame
boncour
it
was
with
a
strange
start
that
he
noticed
that
the
tune
he
was
whistling
was
john
brown
body
lies
in
the
grave
but
his
soul
goes
marching
the
lindens
were
in
bloom
from
a
tree
beside
the
house
great
gusts
of
fragrance
heavy
as
incense
came
in
through
the
open
window
andrews
lay
across
the
table
with
his
eyes
closed
and
his
cheek
in
a
mass
of
ruled
papers
he
was
very
tired
the
first
movement
of
the
soul
and
body
of
john
brown
was
down
on
paper
the
village
clock
struck
two
he
got
to
his
feet
and
stood
a
moment
looking
absently
out
of
the
window
it
was
a
sultry
afternoon
of
swollen
clouds
that
hung
low
over
the
river
the
windmill
on
the
hilltop
opposite
was
motionless
he
seemed
to
hear
genevieve
voice
the
last
time
he
had
seen
her
so
long
ago
you
would
have
been
a
great
he
walked
over
to
the
table
and
turned
over
some
sheets
without
looking
at
them
would
have
been
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
so
you
could
be
a
great
composer
and
a
deserter
too
in
the
year
probably
genevieve
was
right
but
he
must
have
something
to
eat
but
how
late
it
is
expostulated
madame
boncour
when
he
asked
for
lunch
i
know
it
very
late
i
have
just
finished
a
third
of
the
work
doing
and
do
you
get
paid
a
great
deal
when
that
is
finished
asked
madame
boncour
the
dimples
appearing
in
her
broad
cheeks
some
day
you
will
be
lonely
now
that
the
rods
have
have
they
left
did
you
know
did
you
go
to
say
goodby
they
gone
to
the
seashore
but
i
make
you
a
little
thank
when
madame
boncour
cams
back
with
the
omelette
and
fried
potatoes
she
said
to
him
in
a
mysterious
voice
you
did
go
to
see
the
rods
as
often
these
last
madame
boncour
stood
staring
at
him
with
her
red
arms
folded
round
her
breasts
shaking
her
head
when
he
got
up
to
go
upstairs
again
she
suddenly
shouted
and
when
are
you
going
to
pay
me
it
two
weeks
since
you
have
paid
but
madame
boncour
i
told
you
i
had
no
money
if
you
wait
a
day
or
two
i
sure
to
get
some
in
the
mail
it
ca
be
more
than
a
day
or
i
heard
that
story
i
even
tried
to
get
work
at
several
farms
round
madame
boncour
threw
back
her
head
and
laughed
showing
the
blackened
teeth
of
her
lower
jaw
look
here
she
said
at
length
after
this
week
it
finished
you
either
pay
me
or
and
i
sleep
very
lightly
her
voice
took
on
suddenly
its
usual
sleek
singsong
tone
andrews
broke
away
and
ran
upstairs
to
his
room
i
must
fly
the
coop
tonight
he
said
to
himself
but
suppose
then
letters
came
with
money
the
next
day
he
writhed
in
indecision
all
the
afternoon
that
evening
he
took
a
long
walk
in
passing
the
rods
house
he
saw
that
the
shutters
were
closed
it
gave
him
a
sort
of
relief
to
know
that
genevieve
no
longer
lived
near
him
his
solitude
was
complete
now
and
why
instead
of
writing
music
that
would
have
been
worth
while
if
he
had
been
a
deserter
he
kept
asking
himself
had
he
tried
long
ago
to
act
to
make
a
gesture
however
feeble
however
forlorn
for
other
people
freedom
half
by
accident
he
had
managed
to
free
himself
from
the
treadmill
could
he
have
helped
others
if
he
only
had
his
life
to
live
over
again
no
he
had
not
lived
up
to
the
name
of
john
brown
it
was
dark
when
he
got
back
to
the
village
he
had
decided
to
wait
one
more
day
the
next
morning
he
started
working
on
the
second
movement
the
lack
of
a
piano
made
it
very
difficult
to
get
ahead
yet
he
said
to
himself
that
he
should
put
down
what
he
could
as
it
would
be
long
before
he
found
leisure
again
one
night
he
had
blown
out
his
candle
and
stood
at
the
window
watching
the
glint
of
the
moon
on
the
river
he
heard
a
soft
heavy
step
on
the
landing
outside
his
room
a
floorboard
creaked
and
the
key
turned
in
the
lock
the
step
was
heard
again
on
the
stairs
john
andrews
laughed
aloud
the
window
was
only
twenty
feet
from
the
ground
and
there
was
a
trellis
he
got
into
bed
contentedly
he
must
sleep
well
for
tomorrow
night
he
would
slip
out
of
the
window
and
make
for
bordeaux
another
morning
a
brisk
wind
blew
fluttering
andrews
papers
as
he
worked
outside
the
river
was
streaked
blue
and
silver
and
the
windmill
arms
waved
fast
against
the
piled
clouds
the
scent
of
the
lindens
came
only
intermittently
on
the
sharp
wind
in
spite
of
himself
the
tune
of
john
brown
body
had
crept
in
among
his
ideas
andrews
sat
with
a
pencil
at
his
lips
whistling
softly
while
in
the
back
of
his
mind
a
vast
chorus
seemed
singing
john
brown
body
lies
in
the
grave
but
his
soul
goes
marching
on
glory
glory
hallelujah
but
his
soul
goes
marching
if
one
could
only
find
freedom
by
marching
for
it
came
the
thought
all
at
once
he
became
rigid
his
hands
clutched
the
table
edge
there
was
an
american
voice
under
his
window
think
she
kiddin
us
charley
andrews
was
blinded
falling
from
a
dizzy
height
god
could
things
repeat
themselves
like
that
would
everything
be
repeated
and
he
seemed
to
hear
voices
whisper
in
his
ears
one
of
you
men
teach
him
how
to
he
jumped
to
his
feet
and
pulled
open
the
drawer
it
was
empty
the
woman
had
taken
the
revolver
it
all
planned
then
she
knew
he
said
aloud
in
a
low
voice
he
became
suddenly
calm
a
man
in
a
boat
was
passing
down
the
river
the
boat
was
painted
bright
green
the
man
wore
a
curious
jacket
of
a
color
and
held
a
fishing
pole
andrews
sat
in
his
chair
again
the
boat
was
out
of
sight
now
but
there
was
the
windmill
turning
turning
against
the
piled
white
clouds
there
were
steps
on
the
stairs
two
swallows
twittering
curved
past
the
window
very
near
so
that
andrews
could
make
out
the
marking
on
their
wings
and
the
way
they
folded
their
legs
against
their
bellies
there
was
a
knock
come
in
said
andrews
firmly
i
beg
yer
pardon
said
a
soldier
with
his
hat
that
had
a
band
in
his
hand
are
you
the
american
well
the
woman
down
there
said
she
thought
your
papers
was
in
very
good
the
man
stammered
with
embarrassment
their
eyes
met
no
i
a
deserter
said
andrews
the
snatched
for
his
whistle
and
blew
it
hard
there
was
an
answering
whistle
from
outside
the
window
get
your
stuff
i
have
all
right
walk
downstairs
slowly
in
front
of
outside
the
windmill
was
turning
turning
against
the
piled
white
clouds
of
the
sky
andrews
turned
his
eyes
towards
the
door
the
closed
the
door
after
them
and
followed
on
his
heels
down
the
steps
on
john
andrews
writing
table
the
brisk
wind
rustled
among
the
broad
sheets
of
paper
first
one
sheet
then
another
blew
off
the
table
until
the
floor
was
littered
with
them
