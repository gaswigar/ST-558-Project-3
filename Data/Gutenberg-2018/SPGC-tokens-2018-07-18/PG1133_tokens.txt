first
gentleman
you
do
not
meet
a
man
but
frowns
our
bloods
no
more
obey
the
heavens
than
our
courtiers
still
seem
as
does
the
king
second
gentleman
but
what
the
matter
first
gentleman
his
daughter
and
the
heir
of
kingdom
whom
he
purpos
to
his
wife
sole
a
widow
that
late
he
hath
referr
herself
unto
a
poor
but
worthy
gentleman
she
wedded
her
husband
banish
she
imprison
all
is
outward
sorrow
though
i
think
the
king
be
touch
at
very
heart
second
gentleman
none
but
the
king
first
gentleman
he
that
hath
lost
her
too
so
is
the
queen
that
most
desir
the
match
but
not
a
courtier
although
they
wear
their
faces
to
the
bent
of
the
king
looks
hath
a
heart
that
is
not
glad
at
the
thing
they
scowl
at
second
gentleman
and
why
so
first
gentleman
he
that
hath
miss
the
princess
is
a
thing
too
bad
for
bad
report
and
he
that
hath
i
mean
that
married
her
alack
good
man
and
therefore
is
a
creature
such
as
to
seek
through
the
regions
of
the
earth
for
one
his
like
there
would
be
something
failing
in
him
that
should
compare
i
do
not
think
so
fair
an
outward
and
such
stuff
within
endows
a
man
but
he
second
gentleman
you
speak
him
far
first
gentleman
i
do
extend
him
sir
within
himself
crush
him
together
rather
than
unfold
his
measure
duly
second
gentleman
what
his
name
and
birth
first
gentleman
i
can
not
delve
him
to
the
root
his
father
was
call
sicilius
who
did
join
his
honour
against
the
romans
with
cassibelan
but
had
his
titles
by
tenantius
whom
he
serv
with
glory
and
admir
success
so
gain
the
leonatus
and
had
besides
this
gentleman
in
question
two
other
sons
who
in
the
wars
o
th
time
died
with
their
swords
in
hand
for
which
their
father
then
old
and
fond
of
issue
took
such
sorrow
that
he
quit
being
and
his
gentle
lady
big
of
this
gentleman
our
theme
as
he
was
born
the
king
he
takes
the
babe
to
his
protection
calls
him
posthumus
leonatus
breeds
him
and
makes
him
of
his
puts
to
him
all
the
learnings
that
his
time
could
make
him
the
receiver
of
which
he
took
as
we
do
air
fast
as
was
and
in
spring
became
a
harvest
liv
in
which
rare
it
is
to
most
prais
most
lov
a
sample
to
the
youngest
to
th
more
mature
a
glass
that
feated
them
and
to
the
graver
a
child
that
guided
dotards
to
his
mistress
for
whom
he
now
is
her
own
price
proclaims
how
she
esteem
him
and
his
virtue
by
her
election
may
be
truly
read
what
kind
of
man
he
is
second
gentleman
i
honour
him
even
out
of
your
report
but
pray
you
tell
me
is
she
sole
child
to
th
king
first
gentleman
his
only
child
he
had
two
if
this
be
worth
your
hearing
mark
the
eldest
of
them
at
three
years
old
i
th
swathing
clothes
the
other
from
their
nursery
were
and
to
this
hour
no
guess
in
knowledge
which
way
they
went
second
gentleman
how
long
is
this
ago
first
gentleman
some
twenty
years
second
gentleman
that
a
king
children
should
be
so
convey
so
slackly
guarded
and
the
search
so
slow
that
could
not
trace
them
first
gentleman
is
strange
or
that
the
negligence
may
well
be
laugh
at
yet
is
it
true
sir
second
gentleman
i
do
well
believe
you
first
gentleman
we
must
forbear
here
comes
the
gentleman

gaoler

deliver
you
the
keys
that
lock
up
your
restraint
for
you
posthumus
so
soon
as
i
can
win
th
offended
king

will
be
known

advocate

yet
the
fire
of
rage
is
in
him
and

unto
his
sentence

what
patience

wisdom
may
inform
you
posthumus

your
highness

will
from

know
the
peril
i
fetch
a
turn
about

fine
this
tyrant
can
tickle

but
always
reserv
my
holy
what
his
rage
can
do
on
me

be
gone
and
i
shall
here
abide
the
hourly
shot
of
angry
eyes
not
comforted
to
live
but
that
there
is
this
jewel
in
the
world
that
i
may
see
again
posthumus
my
queen
my
mistress
o
lady
weep
no
more
lest
i
give
cause
to
be
suspected
of
more
tenderness
than

become
a
man
i
will
remain
the
husband
that
did
plight
troth

residence
in
rome

pray
you
if
the
king
come

shall
incur
i

not
how
much
of
his
displeasure
aside
yet
i
move
him
to
walk
this
way

him
wrong
but

does
buy
my
injuries

his
eye
or
care
distinguish
him
from
others
he
did
keep
the
deck
with
glove
or
hat
or
handkerchief
still
waving
as
the
fits
and
stirs
of
mind
could
best
express
how
slow

soul

on
how
swift
his
ship
imogen
thou

little

to
look
upon
him
till
the
diminution
of
space
had
pointed
him
sharp
as
my
needle
nay
followed
him
till
he
had
melted
from
the
smallness
of
a
gnat
to
air
and
then
have
turn
mine
eye
and
wept
but

pretty
things

ere
i
could
tell
him
how
i
would
think
on
him
at
certain
hours
such
thoughts
and
such
or
i
could
make
him
swear
the
shes
of
italy
should
not
betray
mine
interest

his
honour
or
have
charg
him

iachimo
a
frenchman
a
dutchman
and
a
spaniard
iachimo
believe
it
sir
i
have
seen
him
in
britain
he
was
then
of
a
crescent
note
expected
to
prove
so
worthy
as
since
he
hath
been
allowed
the
name
of
but
i
could
then
have
look
on
him
without
the
help
of
admiration
though
the
catalogue
of
his
endowments
had
been
tabled
by
his
side
and
i
to
peruse
him
by
items
philario
you
speak
of
him
when
he
was
less
furnish
than
now
he
is
with
that
which
makes
him
both
without
and
within
frenchman
i
have
seen
him
in
france
we
had
very
many
there
could
behold
the
sun
with
as
firm
eyes
as
he
iachimo
this
matter
of
marrying
his
king
daughter
wherein
he
must
be
weighed
rather
by
her
value
than
his
own
words
him
i
doubt
not
a
great
deal
from
the
matter
frenchman
and
then
his
banishment
iachimo
ay
and
the
approbation
of
those
that
weep
this
lamentable
divorce
under
her
colours
are
wonderfully
to
extend
him
be
it
but
to
fortify
her
judgment
which
else
an
easy
battery
might
lay
flat
for
taking
a
beggar
without
less
quality
but
how
comes
it
he
is
to
sojourn
with
you
how
creeps
acquaintance
philario

knowing
to
a
stranger
of
his
quality
i
beseech
you
all
be
better
known
to
this
gentleman
whom
i
commend
to
you
as
a
noble
friend
of
mine
how
worthy
he
is
i
will
leave
to
appear
hereafter
rather
than
story
him
in
his
own
hearing
frenchman
sir
we
have
known
together
in
orleans
posthumus
since
when
i
have
been
debtor
to
you
for
courtesies
which
i
will
be
ever
to
pay
and
yet
pay
still
frenchman
sir
you
my
poor
kindness
i
was
glad
i
did
atone
my
countryman
and
you
it
had
been
pity
you
should
have
been
put
together
with
so
mortal
a
purpose
as
then
each
bore
upon
importance
of
so
slight
and
trivial
a
nature
posthumus
by
your
pardon
sir
i
was
then
a
young
traveller
rather
shunn
to
go
even
with
what
i
heard
than
in
my
every
action
to
be
guided
by
others
experiences
but
upon
my
mended
if
i
offend
not
to
say
it
is
my
quarrel
was
not
altogether
slight
frenchman
faith
yes
to
be
put
to
the
arbitrement
of
swords
and
by
such
two
that
would
by
all
likelihood
have
confounded
one
the
other
or
have
both
iachimo
can
we
with
manners
ask
what
was
the
difference
frenchman
safely
i
think
was
a
contention
in
public
which
may
without
contradiction
suffer
the
report
it
was
much
like
an
argument
that
fell
out
last
night
where
each
of
us
fell
in
praise
of
our
country
mistresses
this
gentleman
at
that
time
and
upon
warrant
of
bloody
his
to
be
more
fair
virtuous
wise
chaste
constant
qualified
and
less
attemptable
than
any
the
rarest
of
our
ladies
in
france
iachimo
that
lady
is
not
now
living
or
this
opinion
by
this
worn
out
posthumus
she
holds
her
virtue
still
and
i
my
mind
iachimo
you
must
not
so
far
prefer
her
fore
ours
of
italy
posthumus
being
so
far
provok
as
i
was
in
france
i
would
abate
her
nothing
though
i
profess
myself
her
adorer
not
her
friend
iachimo
as
fair
and
as
a
kind
of
had
been
something
too
fair
and
too
good
for
any
lady
in
britain
if
she
went
before
others
i
have
seen
as
that
diamond
of
yours
outlustres
many
i
have
beheld
i
could
not
but
believe
she
excelled
many
but
i
have
not
seen
the
most
precious
diamond
that
is
nor
you
the
lady
posthumus
i
prais
her
as
i
rated
her
so
do
i
my
stone
iachimo
what
do
you
esteem
it
at
posthumus
more
than
the
world
enjoys
iachimo
either
your
unparagon
mistress
is
dead
or
outpriz
by
a
trifle
posthumus
you
are
mistaken
the
one
may
be
sold
or
given
if
there
were
wealth
enough
for
the
purchase
or
merit
for
the
gift
the
other
is
not
a
thing
for
sale
and
only
the
gift
of
the
gods
iachimo
which
the
gods
have
given
you
posthumus
which
by
their
graces
i
will
keep
iachimo
you
may
wear
her
in
title
yours
but
you
know
strange
fowl
light
upon
neighbouring
ponds
your
ring
may
be
too
so
your
brace
of
unprizable
estimations
the
one
is
but
frail
and
the
other
casual
a
cunning
thief
or
a
courtier
would
hazard
the
winning
both
of
first
and
last
posthumus
your
italy
contains
none
so
accomplish
a
courtier
to
convince
the
honour
of
my
mistress
if
in
the
holding
or
loss
of
that
you
term
her
frail
i
do
nothing
doubt
you
have
store
of
thieves
notwithstanding
i
fear
not
my
ring
philario
let
us
leave
here
gentlemen
posthumus
sir
with
all
my
heart
this
worthy
signior
i
thank
him
makes
no
stranger
of
me
we
are
familiar
at
first
iachimo
with
five
times
so
much
conversation
i
should
get
ground
of
your
fair
mistress
make
her
go
back
even
to
the
yielding
had
i
admittance
and
opportunity
to
friend
posthumus
no
no
iachimo
i
dare
thereupon
pawn
the
moiety
of
my
estate
to
your
ring
which
in
my
opinion
it
something
but
i
make
my
wager
rather
against
your
confidence
than
her
reputation
and
to
bar
your
offence
herein
too
i
durst
attempt
it
against
any
lady
in
the
world
posthumus
you
are
a
great
deal
abus
in
too
bold
a
persuasion
and
i
doubt
not
you
sustain
what
worthy
of
by
your
attempt
iachimo
what
that
posthumus
a
repulse
though
your
attempt
as
you
call
it
deserve
a
punishment
too
philario
gentlemen
enough
of
this
it
came
in
too
suddenly
let
it
die
as
it
was
born
and
i
pray
you
be
better
acquainted
iachimo
would
i
had
put
my
estate
and
my
neighbour
on
approbation
of
what
i
have
spoke
posthumus
what
lady
would
you
choose
to
assail
iachimo
yours
whom
in
constancy
you
think
stands
so
safe
i
will
lay
you
ten
thousand
ducats
to
your
ring
that
commend
me
to
the
court
where
your
lady
is
with
no
more
advantage
than
the
opportunity
of
a
second
conference
and
i
will
bring
from
thence
that
honour
of
hers
which
you
imagine
so
reserv
posthumus
i
will
wage
against
your
gold
gold
to
it
my
ring
i
hold
dear
as
my
finger
is
part
of
it
iachimo
you
are
a
friend
and
therein
the
wiser
if
you
buy
ladies
flesh
at
a
million
a
dram
you
can
not
preserve
it
from
tainting
but
i
see
you
have
some
religion
in
you
that
you
fear
posthumus
this
is
but
a
custom
in
your
tongue
you
bear
a
graver
purpose
i
hope
iachimo
i
am
the
master
of
my
speeches
and
would
undergo
spoken
i
swear
posthumus
will
you
i
shall
but
lend
my
diamond
till
your
return
let
there
be
covenants
drawn
between
my
mistress
exceeds
in
goodness
the
hugeness
of
your
unworthy
thinking
i
dare
you
to
this
match
here
my
ring
philario
i
will
have
it
no
lay
iachimo
by
the
gods
it
is
one
if
i
bring
you
no
sufficient
testimony
that
i
have
enjoy
the
dearest
bodily
part
of
your
mistress
my
ten
thousand
ducats
are
yours
so
is
your
diamond
too
if
i
come
off
and
leave
her
in
such
honour
as
you
have
trust
in
she
your
jewel
this
your
jewel
and
my
gold
are
provided

your
commendation
for
my
more
free
entertainment

i
embrace
these
conditions
let
us
have
articles
betwixt
us

thus
far
you
shall
answer
if
you
make
your
voyage
upon
her
and
give
me
directly
to
understand
you
have
prevail
i
am
no

debate
if

appear
otherwise
for
your
ill
opinion

th
assault
you

made
to
her

a
covenant
we
will
have
these
things

here
they

madam
presenting
a
box
but
i
beseech
your
grace
without
my
conscience
bids
me
wherefore
you
have
commanded
of
me
these
most
poisonous
compounds
which
are
the
movers
of
a
languishing
death
but
though
slow
deadly
queen
i
wonder
doctor
thou

such
a
question
have
i
not
been
thy
pupil
long
hast
thou
not
learn
me
how
to
make

yea
so
that
our
great
king
himself
doth
woo
me
oft
for
my
confections
having
thus
far
unless
thou
me
not
meet
that
i
did
amplify
my
judgment
in
other
conclusions
i
will
try
the
forces
of
these
thy
compounds
on
such
creatures
as
we
count
not
worth
the
but
none
to
try
the
vigour
of
them
and
apply
allayments
to
their
act
and
by
them
gather
their
several
virtues
and
effects
cornelius
your
highness
shall
from
this
practice
but
make
hard
your
heart
besides
the
seeing
these
effects

noisome

infectious

your

i
do
suspect
you

but
you
shall
do
no
harm
queen
to
pisanio
hark
thee
a
word
cornelius
aside
i
do
not
like
her
she
doth
think
she
has
strange
poisons
i
do
know
her
spirit
and
will
not
trust
one
of
her
malice
with
a
drug
of
such
damn
nature
those
she
has
will
stupefy
and
dull
the
sense
awhile
which
first
perchance
she
prove
on
cats
and
dogs
then
afterward
up
higher
but
there
is
no
danger
in
what
show
of
death
it
makes
more
than
the
locking
up
the
spirits
a
time
to
be

fresh
reviving
she
is
with
a
most
false
effect

i

an

julius

smil
at

found
their

worthy
his
frowning

philario
welcome
sir
posthumus
i
hope
the
briefness
of

made
the
speediness
of

iachimo
your

is
one
of
the
fairest
that
i
have
look
upon
posthumus
and
therewithal
the
best
or
let
her
beauty
look
through
a
casement
to
allure
false
hearts
and
be
false
with
them
iachimo
here
are
letters
for
you
posthumus
their
tenour
good
i
trust
iachimo
is
very
like
philario
was
caius
lucius
in
the
britain
court
when
you
were
there
iachimo
he
was
expected
then
but
not
approach
posthumus
all
is
well
yet
sparkles
this
stone
as
it
was
wont
or
not
too
dull
for
your
good
wearing
iachimo
if
i
have
lost
it
i
should
have
lost
the
worth
of
it
in
gold
i
make
a
journey
twice
as
far
t
enjoy
a
second
night
of
such
sweet
shortness
which
was
mine
in
britain
for
the
ring
is
won
posthumus
the
stone
too
hard
to
come
by
iachimo
not
a
whit
your
lady
being
so
easy
posthumus
make
not
sir
your
loss
your
sport
i
hope
you
know
that
we
must
not
continue
friends
iachimo
good
sir
we
must
if
you
keep
covenant
had
i
not
brought
the
knowledge
of
your
mistress
home
i
grant
we
were
to
question
farther
but
i
now
profess
myself
the
winner
of
her
honour
together
with
your
ring
and
not
the
wronger
of
her
or
you
having
proceeded
but
by
both
your
wills
posthumus
if
you
can
apparent
that
you
have
tasted
her
in
bed
my
hand
and
ring
is
yours
if
not
the
foul
opinion
you
had
of
her
pure
honour
gains
or
loses
your
sword
or
mine
or
masterless
leaves
both
to
who
shall
find
them
iachimo
sir
my
circumstances
being
so
near
the
truth
as
i
will
make
them
must
first
induce
you
to
whose
strength
i
will
confirm
with
oath
which
i
doubt
not
you
give
me
leave
to
spare
when
you
shall
find
you
need
it
not
posthumus
proceed
iachimo
first
her
bedchamber
where
i
confess
i
slept
not
but
profess
had
that
was
well
worth
was
with
tapestry
of
silk
and
silver
the
story
proud
cleopatra
when
she
met
her
roman
and
cydnus
swell
above
the
banks
or
for
the
press
of
boats
or
pride
a
piece
of
work
so
bravely
done
so
rich
that
it
did
strive
in
workmanship
and
value
which
i
could
be
so
rarely
and
exactly
wrought
since
the
true
life
o
posthumus
this
is
true
and
this
you
might
have
heard
of
here
by
me
or
by
some
other
iachimo
more
particulars
must
justify
my
knowledge
posthumus
so
they
must
or
do
your
honour
injury
iachimo
the
chimney
is
south
the
chamber
and
the
chimneypiece
chaste

never

figures
so
likely
to
report
themselves
the
cutter
was
as
another
nature
dumb
outwent
her
motion
and
breath
left
out
posthumus
this
is
a
thing
which
you
might
from
relation
likewise
reap
being
as
it
is
much
spoke
of
iachimo
the
roof
o
th
chamber
with
golden
cherubins
is
fretted
her
i
had
forgot
were
two
winking
cupids
of
silver
each
on
one
foot
standing
nicely
depending
on
their
brands
posthumus
this
is
her
honour
let
it
be
granted
you
have
seen
all
this
and
praise
be
given
to
your
remembrance
the
description
of
what
is
in
her
chamber
nothing
saves
the
wager
you
have
laid
iachimo
then
if
you
can
shows
the
bracelet
be
pale
i
beg
but
leave
to
air
this
jewel
see
and
now
is
up
again
it
must
be
married
to
that
your
diamond
i
keep
them
posthumus
jove
once
more
let
me
behold
it
is
it
that
which
i
left
with
her
iachimo
i
thank
that
she
stripp
it
from
her
arm
i
see
her
yet
her
pretty
action
did
outsell
her
gift
and
yet
enrich
it
too
she
gave
it
me
and
said
she
priz
it
once
posthumus
may
be
she
pluck
it
of
to
send
it
me
iachimo
she
writes
so
to
you
doth
she

o
no

here
take
this
too

the

a
basilisk
unto
mine

there

the

of
no

where
they

which
is
nothing
o
above
measure
false
philario
have
patience
sir
and
take
your
ring
again
is
not
yet
won
it
may
be
probable
she
lost
it
or
who
knows
if
one
her
women
being
corrupted
hath
it
from
her
posthumus
very
true
and
so
i
hope
he
came
back
my
ring
render
to
me
some
corporal
sign
about
her
more
evident
than
this
for
this
was
iachimo
by
jupiter
i
had
it
from
her
arm
posthumus
hark
you
he
swears
by
jupiter
he
swears
is
nay
keep
the
ring
is
true
i
am
sure
she
would
not
lose
it
her
attendants
are
all
sworn
and
they
induc
to
steal
it
and
by
a
stranger
no
he
hath

her
the
cognizance
of
her
incontinency

this
she
hath
bought
the

thus
dearly
there
take
thy
hire
and
all
the
fiends
of
hell
divide
themselves
between
you
philario
sir
be
patient
this
is
not
strong
enough
to
be
of
one
persuaded
well
of
posthumus
never
talk
o
she
hath
been
colted
by
him
iachimo

and
i
grieve
myself
to
think
when
thou
shalt
be
disedg
by
her
that
now
thou
tirest
on
how
thy
memory
will
then
be
pang
by
me
prithee
dispatch
the
lamp
entreats
the
butcher
where
thy
knife
thou
art
too
slow
to
do
thy
master
bidding
when
i
desire
it
too
pisanio
o
gracious
lady
since
i
receiv
command
to
do
this
busines
i
have
not
slept
one
wink
imogen
and
to
bed
then
pisanio
i
wake
mine
eyeballs
first
imogen
wherefore
then
didst
undertake
it
why
hast
thou
so
many
miles
with
a
pretence
this
place
mine
action
and
thine
own
our
horses
labour
the
time
inviting
thee
the
perturb
court
for
my
being
absent
whereunto
i
never
purpose
return
why
hast
thou
gone
so
far
to
be
unbent
when
thou
hast
thy
stand
th
elected
deer
before
thee
pisanio
but
to
win
time
to
lose
so
bad
employment
in
the
which
i
have
consider
of
a
course
good
lady
hear
me
with
patience
imogen
talk
thy
tongue
speak
i
have
heard
i
am
a
strumpet
and
mine
ear
therein
false
struck
can
take
no
greater
wound
nor
tent
to
bottom
that
but
speak
pisanio
then
madam
i
thought
you
would
not
back
again
imogen
most
bringing
me
here
to
kill
me
pisanio
not
so
neither
but
if
i
were
as
wise
as
honest
then
my
purpose
would
prove
well
it
can
not
be
but
that
my
master
is
abus
some
villain
ay
and
singular
in
his
art
hath
done
you
both
this
cursed
injury
imogen
some
roman
courtezan
pisanio
no
on
my
life
i
give
but
notice
you
are
dead
and
send
him
some
bloody
sign
of
it
for
is
commanded
i
should
do
so
you
shall
be
miss
at
court
and
that
will
well
confirm
it
imogen
why
good
fellow
what
shall
i
do
the
while
where
bide
how
live
or
in
my
life
what
comfort
when
i
am
dead
to
my
husband
pisanio
if
you
back
to
th
imogen
no
court
no
father
nor
no
more
ado
with
that
harsh
noble
simple
that
cloten
whose
hath
been
to
me
as
fearful
as
a
siege
pisanio
if
not
at
court
then
not
in
britain
must
you
bide
imogen
where
then
hath
britain
all
the
sun
that
shines
day
night
are
they
not
but
in
britain
i
th
world
volume
our
britain
seems
as
of
it
but
not
i
in
a
great
pool
a
swan
nest
prithee
think
there
livers
out
of
britain
pisanio
i
am
most
glad
you
think
of
other
place
th
ambassador
lucius
the
roman
comes
to
milford
haven
now
if
you
could
wear
a
mind
dark
as
your
fortune
is
and
but
disguise
that
which
t
appear
itself
must
not
yet
be
but
by
you
should
tread
a
course
pretty
and
full
of
view
yea
happily
near
the
residence
of
posthumus
so
nigh
at
least
that
though
his
actions
were
not
visible
yet
report
should
render
him
hourly
to
your
ear
as
truly
as
he
moves
imogen
o
for
such
means
though
peril
to
my
modesty
not
death
o
i
would
adventure
pisanio
well
then
here
the
point
you
must
forget
to
be
a
woman
change
command
into
obedience
fear
and
the
handmaids
of
all
women
or
more
truly
woman
it
pretty
into
a
waggish
courage
ready
in
gibes
saucy
and
as
quarrelous
as
the
weasel
nay
you
must
forget
that
rarest
treasure
of
your
cheek
exposing
but
o
the
harder
heart
alack
no
remedy
to
the
greedy
touch
of
titan
and
forget
your
laboursome
and
dainty
trims
wherein
you
made
great
juno
angry
imogen
nay
be
brief
i
see
into
thy
end
and
am
almost
a
man
already
pisanio
first
make
yourself
but
like
one
this
i
have
already
is
in
my
doublet

their
serving
and
with
what
imitation
you
can
borrow
from
youth
of
such
a
season

yourself
desire
his
service
tell
him
wherein
you
which
will
make
him

with
joy
he
will
embrace
you
for

honourable
and
doubling

most
holy
your
means
you
have
me
rich
and

the
duty

thing
more
made
of
malice
than
of

noted

call
her
before

for
we
have
been
too
slight
in
sufferance

a
messenger

since
the
exile
of

most
hath
her

been
the
cure
whereof
my
lord

time
must
do
beseech
your
majesty
forbear
sharp
speeches
to
her
she
a
lady
so
tender
of
rebukes
that
words
are
strokes
and
strokes

daily
she
was
bound
to
proffer

me
to
blame
in

a
drug
of
mine
i
pray
his
absence

by
swallowing
that
for
he
believes
it
is
a
thing
most
precious
but
for
her
where

she
gone
haply
despair

seiz
her
or
wing
with
fervour
of
her
love
she
flown
to
her
desir
posthumus

she
is
to
death

ladies
woman
from
every
one
the
best
she
hath
and
she
of
all
compounded
outsells
them
all
i
love
her
therefore
but
disdaining
me
and
throwing
favours
on
the
low
posthumus
slanders
so
her
judgment
that
what
else
rare
is
chok
and
in
that
point
i
will
conclude
to
hate
her

to
be
reveng
upon

the
bitterness

now
belch
from
my
that
she

more
respect

that

would
fly

rustic
mountaineer
exeunt
fighting
belarius
and
arviragus
belarius
no
company
abroad
arviragus
none
in
the
world
you
did
mistake
him
sure
belarius
i
can
not
tell
long
is
it
since
i
saw
him
but
time
hath
nothing
blurr
those
lines
of
favour
which
then
he
wore
the
snatches
in
his
voice
and
burst
of
speaking
were
as
his
i
am
absolute
was
very
cloten
arviragus
in
this
place
we
left
them
i
wish
my
brother
make
good
time
with
him
you
say
he
is
so
fell
belarius
being
scarce
made
up
i
mean
to
man
he
had
not
apprehension
or
roaring
terrors
for
defect
of
judgment
is
oft
the
cease
of
fear
guiderius
with
cloten
head
but
see
thy
brother
guiderius
this
cloten
was
a
fool
an
empty
purse
there
was
no
money
i
not
hercules
could
have
knock
out
his
brains
for
he
had
none
yet
i
not
doing
this
the
fool
had
borne
my
head
as
i
do
his
belarius
what
hast
thou
done
guiderius
i
am
perfect
what
cut
off
one
cloten
head
son
to
the
queen
after
his
own
report
who
call
me
traitor
mountaineer
and
swore
with
his
own
single
hand
he
take
us
in
displace
our
heads
thank
the
gods
they
grow
and
set
them
on
lud
town
belarius
we
are
all
undone
guiderius
why
worthy
father
what
have
we
to
lose
but
that
he
swore
to
take
our
lives
the
law
protects
not
us
then
why
should
we
be
tender
to
let
an
arrogant
piece
of
flesh
threat
us
play
judge
and
executioner
all
himself
for
we
do
fear
the
law
what
company
discover
you
abroad
belarius
no
single
soul
can
we
set
eye
on
but
in
an
safe
reason
he
must
have
some
attendants
though
his
humour
was
nothing
but
ay
and
that
from
one
bad
thing
to
not
frenzy
not
absolute
madness
could
so
far
have
rav
to
bring
him
here
alone
although
perhaps
it
may
be
heard
at
court
that
such
as
we
cave
here
hunt
here
are
outlaws
and
in
time
may
make
some
stronger
the
which
he
hearing
as
it
is
like
him
might
break
out
and
swear
he
fetch
us
in
yet
not
probable
to
come
alone
either
he
so
undertaking
or
they
so
suffering
then
on
good
ground
we
fear
if
we
do
fear
this
body
hath
a
tail
more
perilous
than
the
head
arviragus
let
ordinance
come
as
the
gods
foresay
it
my
brother
hath
done
well
belarius
i
had
no
mind
to
hunt
this
day
the
boy
fidele
sickness
did
make
my
way
long
forth
guiderius
with
his
own
sword
which
he
did
wave
against
my
throat
i
have
his
head
from
him
i
into
the
creek
behind
our
rock
and
let
it
to
the
sea
and
tell
the
fishes
he
the
queen
son
cloten
that
all
i
reck
exit
belarius
i
be
reveng
would
polydore
thou
hadst
not
though
valour
becomes
thee
well
enough
arviragus
would
i
had
so
the
revenge
alone
pursu
me
polydore
i
love
thee
brotherly
but
envy
much
thou
hast
robb
me
of
this
deed
i
would
revenges
that
possible
strength
might
meet
would
seek
us
through
and
put
us
to
our
answer
belarius
well
is
done
we
hunt
no
more
nor
seek
for
danger
where
there
no
profit
i
prithee
to
our

you
and
fidele
play
the
cooks
i
stay
till
hasty
polydore
return
and
bring
him
to
dinner
presently
arviragus
poor
sick
fidele
i
willingly
to
him
to
gain
his
colour
i
let
a
parish
of
such
cloten
blood
and
praise
myself
for
charity
exit
belarius
o
thou
goddess
thou
divine
nature
thou
thyself
thou
in
these
two
princely
boys
they
are
as
gentle
as
zephyrs
blowing
below
the
violet
not
wagging
his
sweet
head
and
yet
as
rough
their
royal
blood
enchaf
as
the
wind
that
by
the
top
doth
take
the
mountain
pine
and
make
him
stoop
to
th
vale
is
wonder
that
an
invisible
instinct
should
frame
them
to
royalty
unlearn
honour
untaught
civility
not
seen
from
other
valour
that
wildly
grows
in
them
but
yields
a
crop
as
if
it
had
been
sow
yet
still
it
strange
what
cloten
being
here
to
us
portends
or
what
his
death
will
bring
us
guiderius
guiderius
where
my
brother
i
have
sent
cloten
clotpoll
down
the
stream
in
embassy
to
his

what

cadwal
now
to
give
it
motion
hark
guiderius
is
he
at
home
belarius
he
went
hence
even
now
guiderius
what
does
he
mean
since
death
of
my
mother
it
did
not
speak
before
all
solemn
things
should
answer
solemn
accidents
the
matter
triumphs
for
nothing
and
lamenting
toys
is
jollity
for

and
grief
for

is
cadwal
mad
arviragus
with
imogen
as
dead
bearing
her
in
his

belarius
look
here
he
comes
and
brings
the
dire
occasion
in
his
arms
of
what
we
blame
him
for
arviragus
the
bird
is
dead
that
we
have
made
so
much
on
i
had
rather
have
skipp
from
sixteen
years
of

to
sixty
to
have
turn
my
leaping
time
into
a

than
have
seen

half
so
well
as
when

but
sleeps
if

his

will
his

be
haunted
and

neither

this
is

a

in

nothing
becoming

arviragus
it

have
both

i

by

if
you
will
not
the

due
fall
on

so
say
amen

no

you

should
reserve
my

one

have

gaoler
gaoler
come

are
you
ready

posthumus
rather
ready
long

gaoler
hanging
is
the
word
sir
if
you
be
ready
for
that
you
are
well
cook
posthumus
so
if
i
prove
a
good
repast
to
the
spectators
the
dish
pays
the
shot
gaoler
a
heavy
reckoning
for
you
sir
but
the
comfort
is
you
shall
be
called
to
no
more
payments
fear
no
more
tavern
bills
which
are
often
the
sadness
of
parting
as
the
procuring
of

you
come
in
faint
for
want
of
meat
depart
reeling
with
too
much
drink
sorry
that
you
have
paid
too
much
and
sorry
that
you
are
paid
too
much
purse
and
brain
both
empty
the
brain
the
heavier
for
being
too
light
the
purse
too
light
being
drawn
of
heaviness
o
of
this
contradiction
you
shall
now
be
quit
o
the
charity
of
a
penny
cord
it
sums
up
thousands
in
a
trice
you
have
no
true
debitor
and
creditor
but
it
of
what
past
is
and
to
come
the
discharge
your
neck
sir
is
pen
book
and
counters
so
the
acquittance
follows
posthumus
i
am
merrier
to
die
than
thou
art
to
live
gaoler
indeed
sir
he
that
sleeps
feels
not
the
toothache
but
a
man
that
were
to
sleep
your
sleep
and
a
hangman
to
help
him
to
bed
i
think
he
would
change
places
with
his

for
look
you
sir
you
know
not
which
way
you

yet
o

thus
that

say
he
was
too
good
to
be
where
ill
men
were
and
was
the
best
of
all
amongst
the
of
good
sitting
sadly
hearing

for
beauty
that
made
barren
the

boast
of
him
that

could
speak
for

laming
the

of

the
qualities
that

for
besides
that
hook
of
wiving
fairness
which
strikes
the
cymbeline
i
stand
on
fire
come
to
the
matter
iachimo
all
too
soon
i
shall
unless
thou
wouldst
grieve
quickly
this
posthumus
most
like
a
noble
lord
in
love
and
one
that
had
a
royal
lover
took
his
hint
and
not
dispraising
whom
we
therein
he
was
as
calm
as
he
began
his
mistress
picture
which
by
his
tongue
being
made
and
then
a
mind
put
i
either
our
brags
were
crack
of
kitchen
trulls
or
his
description
prov
us
unspeaking
sots
cymbeline
nay
nay
to
th
purpose
iachimo
your
daughter
there
it
begins
he
spake
of
her
as
dian
had
hot
dreams
and
she
alone
were
cold
whereat
i
wretch
made
scruple
of
his
praise
and
wager
with
him
pieces
of
gold
this
which
then
he
wore
upon
his
honour
finger
to
attain
in
suit
the
place
of
bed
and
win
this
ring
by
hers
and
mine
adultery
he
true
knight
no
lesser
of
her
honour
confident
than
i
did
truly
find
her
stakes
this
ring
and
would
so
had
it
been
a
carbuncle
of
phoebus
wheel
and
might
so
safely
had
it
been
all
the
worth
of
car
away
to
britain
post
i
in
this
design
well
may
you
sir
remember
me
at
court
where
i
was
taught
of
your
chaste
daughter
the
wide
difference
amorous
and
villainous
being
thus
of
hope
not
longing
mine
italian
brain
gan
in
your
duller
britain
operate
most
vilely
for
my
vantage
excellent
and
to
be
brief
my
practice
so
that
i
return
with
simular
proof
enough
to
make
the
noble
leonatus
mad
by
wounding
his
belief
in
her
renown
with
tokens
thus
and
thus
averring
notes
of
pictures
this
her
o
cunning
how
i
got
it
nay
some
marks
of
secret
on
her
person
that
he
could
not
but
think
her
bond
of
chastity
quite
crack
i
having
the
forfeit
methinks
i
see
him
posthumus
coming
forward
ay
so

a
feigned
letter
of
my
then
in
my
pocket
which
directed
him
to
seek
her
on
the
mountains
near
to
milford
where
in
a
frenzy
in
my
master
garments
which
he
enforc
from
me
away
he
posts
with
unchaste
purpose
and
with
oath
to
violate
my
lady
honour
what
became
of
him
i
further
know
not
guiderius
let
me
end
the
story
i
slew
him
there

gods

i
would
not
thy
good
deeds
should
from
my
lips
pluck
a
hard
sentence
prithee
valiant
youth
again
guiderius
i
have
spoke
it
and
i
did
it
cymbeline
he
was
a
prince
guiderius
a
most
incivil
one
the
wrongs
he
did
me
were
nothing
for
he
did
provoke
me
with
language
that
would
make
me
spurn
the
sea
if
it
could
so
roar
to
me
i
cut
off
head
and
am
right
glad
he
is
not
standing
here
to
tell
this
tale
of
mine
cymbeline
i
am
sorry
for
thee
by
thine
own
tongue
thou
art
condemn
and
must
endure
our
law
dead
imogen
that
headless
man
i
thought
had
been
my
lord
cymbeline
bind
the
offender
and
take
him
from
our
presence
belarius
stay
sir
king
this
man
is
better
than
the
man
he
slew
as
well
descended
as
thyself
and
hath
more
of
thee
merited
than
a
band
of
clotens
had
ever
scar
for
to
the
guard
let
his
arms
alone
they
were
not
born
for
bondage
cymbeline
why
old
soldier
wilt
thou
undo
the
worth
thou
art
unpaid
for
by
tasting
of
our
wrath
how
of
descent
as
good
as
we
arviragus
in
that
he
spake
too
far
cymbeline
and
thou
shalt
die
belarius

will
die

i
will
prove
that
two
on
are
as
good
as
i
have
given

must
for
mine
own
part
unfold

dangerous
speech

danger

and
our
good

will
prefer

not
the
old
father
mighty
sir
these
two
young
gentlemen
that

me
father
and
think
they
are
my
sons

none
of

are
the
issue
of
your
loins
my
liege
and
blood
of
your
begetting

issue
belarius
so
sure
as
you
your
father
i
old
morgan
am
that
belarius
whom
you
sometime
banish
your
pleasure
was
my
mere
offence
my
punishment
itself
and
all
my
treason
that
i
was
all
the
harm
i
did
these
gentle
for
such
and
so
they
these
twenty
years
have
i
train
up
those
arts
they
have
as
could
put
into
them
my
breeding
was
sir
as
your
highness
knows
their
nurse
euriphile
whom
for
the
theft
i
wedded
stole
these
children
upon
my
banishment
i
mov
her
having
receiv
the
punishment
before
for
that
which
i
did
then
beaten
for
loyalty
excited
me
to
treason
their
dear
loss

more
of
you
was
felt
the
more
it
unto
my
end
of
stealing
them
but
gracious
sir

your
sons

i
must
lose
two
of
the
companions
in
the
world
the
benediction
of
these
covering
heavens
fall
on
their
heads
like
dew
for
they
are
worthy
to
inlay
heaven
with
stars
cymbeline
thou
and
the
service
that
you
three
have
done
is
more
unlike
than
this
thou
i
lost
my
children
if
these
be
they
i
know
not
how
to
wish
a
pair
of
worthier
sons

your
younger
princely
son

was
in
a
most
curious
mantle
wrought
by
th
hand
of
his
queen
mother
which
for
more
probation
i
can
with
ease
produce
cymbeline
guiderius
had
upon
his
neck
a
mole
a
sanguine
star
it
was
a
mark
of
wonder
belarius
this
is
he
who
hath
upon
him
still
that
natural
stamp

was
wise

o
rare
instinct
when
shall
i
hear
all
through
this
fierce
abridgment

to
it
circumstantial
branches
which
distinction
should
be
rich
in
where
how
liv
you
and
when
came
you
to
serve
our
roman
captive
how
parted
with
your
brothers
how
first
met
them
why
fled
you
from
the
court
and
whither
these
and
your
three
motives
to
the
battle
with
i
know
not
how
much
more
should
be
demanded
and
all
the
other
from
chance
to
chance
but
nor
the
time
nor
place
will
serve
our
long
interrogatories
see
posthumus
anchors
upon
imogen
and
she
like
harmless
lightning
throws
her
eye
on
him
her
brothers
me
her
master
hitting
each
object
with
a
joy
the
counterchange
is
severally
in
all
let
quit
this
ground
and
smoke
the
temple
with
our
sacrifices
to
belarius
thou
art
my
brother
so
we
hold
thee
ever
imogen
you
are
my
father
too
and
did
relieve
me
to
see
this
gracious
season

these
in
bonds
let
them
be
joyful
too
for
they
shall
taste
our
comfort
imogen
my
good
master
i
will
yet
do
you
service
lucius
happy
be
you
cymbeline
the
forlorn
soldier
that
so
nobly
fought
he
would
have
well
becom
this
place
and
the
thankings
of
a
king
posthumus
i
am
sir
the
soldier
that
did
company
these
three
in
poor
beseeming
was
a
fitment
for
the
purpose
i
then
follow
that
i
was
he

iachimo
i
had
you
down
and
might
have
made
you
finish
iachimo
kneeling
i
am
down
again
but
now
my
heavy
conscience
sinks
my
knee
as
then
your
force
did
take
that
life
beseech
you
which
i
so
often
owe
but
your
ring
first
and
here
the
bracelet
of
the
truest
princess
that
ever
swore
her
faith
posthumus
kneel
not
to
me
the
that
i
have
on
you
is
to
spare
you
the
malice
towards
you
to
forgive
you
live
and
deal
with
others
better
cymbeline
nobly
doom

learn
our
freeness
of
a
pardon

spritely
shows
of
mine
own

make
no

of
it

show
his
skill
in
the
construction

here
my
good
lord
lucius
read
and
declare
the
meaning

as
a
lion

shall
to
himself
unknown
without
seeking
find
and
be
embrac
by
a
piece
of
tender
air
and
when
from

shall
be

which
being
dead
many
years
shall
after
revive

his
miseries
britain
be
fortunate

thou
leonatus

the
fit

apt
construction
of
thy

import
so
much
to
cymbeline
the

thy
virtuous
daughter
which
we
call
aer

we
term
it
which
i

is
this
most
constant
wife

answering
the

unknown
