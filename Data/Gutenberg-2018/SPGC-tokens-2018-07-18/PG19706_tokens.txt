in

robert
cairn
looked
out
across
the
quadrangle
the
moon
had
just
arisen
and
it
softened
the
beauty
of
the
old
college
buildings
mellowed
the
harshness
of
time
casting
shadow
pools
beneath
the
cloisteresque
arches
to
the
west
and
setting
out
the
ivy
in
stronger
relief
upon
the
ancient
walls
the
barred
shadow
on
the
lichened
stones
beyond
the
elm
was
cast
by
the
hidden
gate
and
straight
ahead
where
between
a
quaint
and
a
bartizan
a
triangular
patch
of
blue
showed
like
spangled
velvet
lay
the
thames
it
was
from
there
the
cooling
breeze
came
but
cairn
gaze
was
set
upon
a
window
almost
directly
ahead
and
west
below
the
chimneys
within
the
room
to
which
it
belonged
a
lambent
light
played
cairn
turned
to
his
companion
a
ruddy
and
athletic
looking
man
somewhat
bovine
in
type
who
at
the
moment
was
busily
tracing
out
sections
on
a
human
skull
and
checking
his
calculations
from
of
the
nervous
sime
he
said
what
does
ferrara
always
have
a
fire
in
his
rooms
for
at
this
time
of
the
year
sime
glanced
up
irritably
at
the
speaker
cairn
was
a
tall
thin
scotsman
square
jawed
and
with
the
crisp
light
hair
and
grey
eyes
which
often
bespeak
unusual
virility
are
you
going
to
do
any
work
he
inquired
pathetically
i
thought
you
come
to
give
me
a
hand
with
my
i
shall
go
down
on
that
and
there
you
been
stuck
staring
out
of
the
window
wilson
in
the
end
house
has
got
a
most
unusual
brain
said
cairn
with
apparent
irrelevance
has
he
snapped
sime
yes
in
a
bottle
his
governor
is
at
bart
he
sent
it
up
yesterday
you
ought
to
see
it
nobody
will
ever
want
to
put
brain
in
a
bottle
predicted
the
scowling
sime
and
resumed
his
studies
cairn
relighted
his
pipe
staring
across
the
quadrangle
again
then
you
never
been
in
ferrara
rooms
have
you
he
inquired
followed
a
muffled
curse
crash
and
the
skull
went
rolling
across
the
floor
look
here
cairn
cried
sime
i
only
got
a
week
or
so
now
and
my
nervous
system
is
frantically
rocky
i
shall
go
all
to
pieces
on
my
nervous
system
if
you
want
to
talk
go
ahead
when
you
finished
i
can
begin
work
said
cairn
calmly
and
tossed
his
pouch
across
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
ferrara
go
ahead
then
what
is
the
matter
with
ferrara
well
replied
cairn
he
queer
that
no
news
said
sime
filling
his
pipe
we
all
know
he
a
queer
chap
but
he
popular
with
women
he
make
a
fortune
as
a
nerve
specialist
he
does
have
to
he
inherits
a
fortune
when
sir
michael
dies
there
a
pretty
cousin
too
is
there
inquired
sime
slyly
there
is
replied
cairn
of
course
he
continued
my
governor
and
sir
michael
are
bosom
friends
and
although
i
never
seen
much
of
young
ferrara
at
the
same
time
i
got
nothing
against
him
but
he
hesitated
spit
it
out
urged
sime
watching
him
oddly
well
it
silly
i
suppose
but
what
does
he
want
with
a
fire
on
a
blazing
night
like
this
sime
stared
perhaps
he
a
he
suggested
lightly
the
ferraras
although
they
counted
scotch
are
they
must
have
been
italian
originally
spanish
corrected
cairn
they
date
from
the
son
of
andrea
ferrara
the
who
was
a
spaniard
c√¶sar
ferrara
came
with
the
armada
in
as
armourer
his
ship
was
wrecked
up
in
the
bay
of
tobermory
and
he
got
ashore
and
stopped
married
a
scotch
lassie
exactly
but
the
genealogy
of
the
family
does
account
for
habits
what
habits
well
look
cairn
waved
in
the
direction
of
the
open
window
what
does
he
do
in
the
dark
all
night
with
a
fire
going
influenza
nonsense
you
never
been
in
his
rooms
have
you
no
very
few
men
have
but
as
i
said
before
he
popular
with
the
women
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
there
have
been
complaints
any
other
man
would
have
been
sent
down
you
think
he
has
influence
influence
of
some
sort
undoubtedly
well
i
can
see
you
have
serious
doubts
about
the
man
as
i
have
myself
so
i
can
unburden
my
mind
you
recall
that
sudden
thunderstorm
on
thursday
rather
quite
upset
me
for
work
i
was
out
in
it
i
was
lying
in
a
punt
in
the
backwater
you
know
backwater
lazy
dog
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
was
trying
to
make
up
my
mind
whether
i
should
abandon
bones
and
take
the
post
on
the
which
has
been
offered
me
pills
for
the
pen
harley
for
fleet
did
you
decide
not
then
something
happened
which
quite
changed
my
line
of
reflection
the
room
was
becoming
cloudy
with
tobacco
smoke
it
was
delightfully
still
cairn
resumed
a
water
rat
rose
within
a
foot
of
me
and
a
kingfisher
was
busy
on
a
twig
almost
at
my
elbow
twilight
was
just
creeping
along
and
i
could
hear
nothing
but
faint
creakings
of
sculls
from
the
river
and
sometimes
the
drip
of
a
i
thought
the
river
seemed
to
become
suddenly
deserted
it
grew
quite
abnormally
quiet
and
abnormally
dark
but
i
was
so
deep
in
reflection
that
it
never
occurred
to
me
to
move
then
the
flotilla
of
swans
came
round
the
bend
with
apollo
you
know
apollo
the
at
their
head
by
this
time
it
had
grown
tremendously
dark
but
it
never
occurred
to
me
to
ask
myself
why
the
swans
gliding
along
so
noiselessly
might
have
been
phantoms
a
hush
a
perfect
hush
settled
down
sime
that
hush
was
the
prelude
to
a
strange
thing
an
unholy
thing
cairn
rose
excitedly
and
strode
across
to
the
table
kicking
the
skull
out
of
his
way
it
was
the
storm
gathering
snapped
sime
it
was
something
else
gathering
listen
it
got
yet
darker
but
for
some
inexplicable
reason
although
i
must
have
heard
the
thunder
muttering
i
could
take
my
eyes
off
the
swans
then
it
happened
the
thing
i
came
here
to
tell
you
about
i
must
tell
somebody
the
thing
that
i
am
not
going
to
forget
in
a
hurry
he
began
to
knock
out
the
ash
from
his
pipe
go
on
directed
sime
tersely
the
big
swan
apollo
was
within
ten
feet
of
me
he
swam
in
open
water
clear
of
the
others
no
living
thing
touched
him
suddenly
uttering
a
cry
that
chilled
my
very
blood
a
cry
that
i
never
heard
from
a
swan
in
my
life
he
rose
in
the
air
his
huge
wings
extended
like
a
tortured
phantom
sime
i
can
never
forget
it
six
feet
clear
of
the
water
the
uncanny
wail
became
a
stifled
hiss
and
sending
up
a
perfect
fountain
of
water
i
was
deluged
the
poor
old
fell
beat
the
surface
with
his
wings
and
was
still
well
the
other
swans
glided
off
like
ghosts
several
heavy
raindrops
pattered
on
the
leaves
above
i
admit
i
was
scared
apollo
lay
with
one
wing
right
in
the
punt
i
was
standing
up
i
had
jumped
to
my
feet
when
the
thing
occurred
i
stooped
and
touched
the
wing
the
bird
was
quite
dead
sime
i
pulled
the
swan
head
out
of
the
water
and
his
neck
was
broken
no
fewer
than
three
vertebrae
fractured
a
cloud
of
tobacco
smoke
was
wafted
towards
the
open
window
it
is
one
in
a
million
who
could
wring
the
neck
of
a
bird
like
apollo
sime
but
it
was
done
before
my
eyes
without
the
visible
agency
of
god
or
man
as
i
dropped
him
and
took
to
the
pole
the
storm
burst
a
clap
of
thunder
spoke
with
the
voice
of
a
thousand
cannon
and
i
poled
for
bare
life
from
that
haunted
backwater
i
was
drenched
to
the
skin
when
i
got
in
and
i
ran
up
all
the
way
from
the
stage
well
rapped
the
other
again
as
cairn
paused
to
refill
his
pipe
it
was
seeing
the
firelight
flickering
at
ferrara
window
that
led
me
to
do
it
i
do
often
call
on
him
but
i
thought
that
a
rub
down
before
the
fire
and
a
glass
of
toddy
would
put
me
right
the
storm
had
abated
as
i
got
to
the
foot
of
his
stair
only
a
distant
rolling
of
thunder
then
out
of
the
shadows
it
was
quite
dark
into
the
flickering
light
of
the
lamp
came
somebody
all
muffled
up
i
started
horribly
it
was
a
girl
quite
a
pretty
girl
too
but
very
pale
and
with
eyes
she
gave
one
quick
glance
up
into
my
face
muttered
something
an
apology
i
think
and
drew
back
again
into
her
he
been
warned
growled
sime
it
will
be
notice
to
quit
next
time
i
ran
upstairs
and
banged
on
ferrara
door
he
did
open
at
first
but
shouted
out
to
know
who
was
knocking
when
i
told
him
he
let
me
in
and
closed
the
door
very
quickly
as
i
went
in
a
pungent
cloud
met
me
incense
incense
his
rooms
smelt
like
a
i
told
him
so
he
said
he
was
experimenting
with
the
ancient
egyptian
stuff
used
in
the
temples
it
was
all
dark
and
hot
phew
like
a
furnace
rooms
always
were
odd
but
since
the
long
vacation
i
had
been
in
good
lord
they
disgusting
how
ferrara
spent
vacation
in
egypt
i
suppose
he
brought
things
back
things
yes
unholy
things
but
that
brings
me
to
something
too
i
ought
to
know
more
about
the
chap
than
anybody
sir
michael
ferrara
and
the
governor
have
been
friends
for
thirty
years
but
my
father
is
oddly
reticent
quite
singularly
reticent
regarding
antony
anyway
have
you
heard
about
him
in
egypt
i
heard
he
got
into
trouble
for
his
age
he
has
a
devil
of
a
queer
reputation
there
no
disguising
it
what
sort
of
trouble
i
no
idea
nobody
seems
to
know
but
i
heard
from
young
ashby
that
ferrara
was
asked
to
leave
there
some
tale
about
kitchener
kitchener
ashby
says
but
i
do
believe
it
well
ferrara
lighted
a
lamp
an
elaborate
silver
thing
and
i
found
myself
in
a
kind
of
nightmare
museum
there
was
an
unwrapped
mummy
there
the
mummy
of
a
woman
i
ca
possibly
describe
it
he
had
pictures
too
photographs
i
sha
try
to
tell
you
what
they
represented
i
not
but
there
are
some
subjects
that
no
man
anxious
to
avoid
bedlam
would
willingly
investigate
on
the
table
by
the
lamp
stood
a
number
of
objects
such
as
i
had
never
seen
in
my
life
before
evidently
of
great
age
he
swept
them
into
a
cupboard
before
i
had
time
to
look
long
then
he
went
off
to
get
a
bath
towel
slippers
and
so
forth
as
he
passed
the
fire
he
threw
something
in
a
hissing
tongue
of
flame
leapt
up
and
died
down
again
what
did
he
throw
in
i
am
not
absolutely
certain
so
i
wo
say
what
i
it
was
at
the
moment
then
he
began
to
help
me
shed
my
saturated
flannels
and
he
set
a
kettle
on
the
fire
and
so
forth
you
know
the
personal
charm
of
the
man
but
there
was
an
unpleasant
sense
of
something
what
shall
i
say
sinister
ferrara
ivory
face
was
more
pale
than
usual
and
he
conveyed
the
idea
that
he
was
chewed
up
exhausted
beads
of
perspiration
were
on
his
forehead
heat
of
his
rooms
no
said
cairn
shortly
it
was
that
i
had
a
rub
down
and
borrowed
some
slacks
ferrara
brewed
grog
and
pretended
to
make
me
welcome
now
i
come
to
something
which
i
ca
forget
it
may
be
a
mere
coincidence
but
he
has
a
number
of
photographs
in
his
rooms
good
ones
which
he
has
taken
himself
i
not
speaking
now
of
the
monstrosities
the
outrages
i
mean
views
and
girls
particularly
girls
well
standing
on
a
queer
little
easel
right
under
the
lamp
was
a
fine
picture
of
apollo
the
swan
lord
of
the
backwater
sime
stared
dully
through
the
smoke
haze
it
gave
me
a
sort
of
shock
continued
cairn
it
made
me
think
harder
than
ever
of
the
thing
he
had
thrown
in
the
fire
then
in
his
photographic
zenana
was
a
picture
of
a
girl
whom
i
am
almost
sure
was
the
one
i
had
met
at
the
bottom
of
the
stair
another
was
of
myra
duquesne
his
cousin
yes
i
felt
like
tearing
it
from
the
wall
in
fact
the
moment
i
saw
it
i
stood
up
to
go
i
wanted
to
run
to
my
rooms
and
strip
the
clothes
off
my
back
it
was
a
struggle
to
be
civil
any
longer
sime
if
you
had
seen
that
swan
die
sime
walked
over
to
the
window
i
have
a
glimmering
of
your
monstrous
suspicions
he
said
slowly
the
last
man
to
be
kicked
out
of
an
english
varsity
for
this
sort
of
thing
so
far
as
i
know
was
dee
of
john
cambridge
and
that
going
back
to
the
sixteenth
century
i
know
it
utterly
preposterous
of
course
but
i
had
to
confide
in
somebody
i
shift
off
now
sime
sime
nodded
staring
from
the
open
window
as
cairn
was
about
to
close
the
outer
door
cairn
cried
sime
since
you
are
now
a
man
of
letters
and
leisure
you
might
drop
in
and
borrow
wilson
brains
for
me
all
right
shouted
cairn
down
in
the
quadrangle
he
stood
for
a
moment
reflecting
then
acting
upon
a
sudden
resolution
he
strode
over
towards
the
gate
and
ascended
ferrara
stair
for
some
time
he
knocked
at
the
door
in
vain
but
he
persisted
in
his
clamouring
arousing
the
ancient
echoes
finally
the
door
was
opened
antony
ferrara
faced
him
he
wore
a
dressing
gown
trimmed
with
white
swansdown
above
which
his
ivory
throat
rose
statuesque
the
eyes
black
as
night
gleamed
strangely
beneath
the
low
smooth
brow
the
lank
black
hair
appeared
lustreless
by
comparison
his
lips
were
very
red
in
his
whole
appearance
there
was
something
repellently
effeminate
can
i
come
in
demanded
cairn
abruptly
is
it
something
important
ferrara
voice
was
husky
but
not
unmusical
why
are
you
busy
well
er
ferrara
smiled
oddly
oh
a
visitor
snapped
cairn
not
at
all
accounts
for
your
delay
in
opening
said
cairn
and
turned
on
his
heel
mistook
me
for
the
proctor
in
person
i
suppose
ferrara
made
no
reply
but
although
he
never
once
glanced
back
cairn
knew
that
ferrara
leaning
over
the
rail
above
was
looking
after
him
it
was
as
though
elemental
heat
were
beating
down
upon
his
head
chapter
ii
the
phantom
hands
a
week
later
robert
cairn
quitted
oxford
to
take
up
the
newspaper
appointment
offered
to
him
in
london
it
may
have
been
due
to
some
mysterious
design
of
a
hidden
providence
that
sime
him
early
in
the
week
about
an
unusual
case
in
one
of
the
hospitals
walton
is
junior
there
he
said
and
he
can
arrange
for
you
to
see
the
case
she
the
patient
undoubtedly
died
from
some
rare
nervous
affection
i
have
a
theory
etc
the
conversation
became
technical
cairn
went
to
the
hospital
and
by
courtesy
of
walton
whom
he
had
known
at
oxford
was
permitted
to
view
the
body
the
symptoms
which
sime
has
got
to
hear
about
explained
the
surgeon
raising
the
sheet
from
the
dead
woman
face
are
he
broke
off
cairn
had
suddenly
exhibited
a
ghastly
pallor
he
clutched
at
walton
for
support
my
god
cairn
still
holding
on
to
the
other
stooped
over
the
discoloured
face
it
had
been
a
pretty
face
when
warm
life
had
tinted
its
curves
now
it
was
congested
awful
two
heavy
discolorations
showed
one
on
either
side
of
the
region
of
the
larynx
what
on
earth
is
wrong
with
you
demanded
walton
i
thought
gasped
cairn
for
a
moment
that
i
knew
really
i
wish
you
did
we
ca
find
out
anything
about
her
have
a
good
look
no
said
cairn
mastering
himself
with
an
effort
a
chance
resemblance
that
all
he
wiped
the
beads
of
perspiration
from
his
forehead
you
look
jolly
shaky
commented
walton
is
she
like
someone
you
know
very
well
no
not
at
all
now
that
i
come
to
consider
the
features
but
it
was
a
shock
at
first
what
on
earth
caused
death
asphyxia
answered
walton
shortly
ca
you
see
someone
strangled
her
and
she
was
brought
here
too
late
not
at
all
my
dear
chap
nobody
strangled
her
she
was
brought
here
in
a
critical
state
four
or
five
days
ago
by
one
of
the
slum
priests
who
keep
us
so
busy
we
diagnosed
it
as
exhaustion
from
lack
of
food
with
other
complications
but
the
case
was
doing
quite
well
up
to
last
night
she
was
recovering
strength
then
at
about
one
she
sprang
up
in
bed
and
fell
back
choking
by
the
time
the
nurse
got
to
her
it
was
all
over
but
the
marks
on
her
throat
walton
shrugged
his
shoulders
there
they
are
our
men
are
keenly
interested
it
absolutely
unique
young
shaw
who
has
a
mania
for
the
nervous
system
sent
a
long
account
up
to
sime
who
suffers
from
a
similar
form
of
aberration
yes
sime
me
it
nothing
to
do
with
nerves
said
walton
contemptuously
ask
me
to
explain
it
but
it
certainly
no
nerve
case
one
of
the
other
patients
my
dear
chap
the
other
patients
were
all
fast
asleep
the
nurse
was
at
her
table
in
the
corner
and
in
full
view
of
the
bed
the
whole
time
i
tell
you
no
one
touched
her
how
long
elapsed
before
the
nurse
got
to
her
possibly
half
a
minute
but
there
is
no
means
of
learning
when
the
paroxysm
commenced
the
leaping
up
in
bed
probably
marked
the
end
and
not
the
beginning
of
the
attack
cairn
experienced
a
longing
for
the
fresh
air
it
was
as
though
some
evil
cloud
hovered
around
and
about
the
poor
unknown
strange
ideas
horrible
ideas
conjectures
based
upon
imaginings
all
but
insane
flooded
his
mind
darkly
leaving
the
hospital
which
harboured
a
grim
secret
he
stood
at
the
gate
for
a
moment
undecided
what
to
do
his
father
cairn
was
out
of
london
or
he
would
certainly
have
sought
him
in
this
hour
of
sore
perplexity
what
in
heaven
name
is
behind
it
all
he
asked
himself
for
he
knew
beyond
doubt
that
the
girl
who
lay
in
the
hospital
was
the
same
that
he
had
seen
one
night
at
oxford
was
the
girl
whose
photograph
he
had
found
in
antony
ferrara
rooms
he
formed
a
sudden
resolution
a
was
passing
at
that
moment
and
he
hailed
it
giving
sir
michael
ferrara
address
he
could
scarcely
trust
himself
to
think
but
frightful
possibilities
presented
themselves
to
him
repel
them
how
he
might
london
seemed
to
grow
dark
overshadowed
as
once
he
had
seen
a
thames
backwater
grow
he
shuddered
as
though
from
a
physical
chill
the
house
of
the
famous
egyptian
scholar
dull
white
behind
its
rampart
of
trees
presented
no
unusual
appearances
to
his
anxious
scrutiny
what
he
feared
he
scarcely
knew
what
he
suspected
he
could
not
have
defined
sir
michael
said
the
servant
was
unwell
and
could
see
no
one
that
did
not
surprise
cairn
sir
michael
had
not
enjoyed
good
health
since
malaria
had
laid
him
low
in
syria
but
miss
duquesne
was
at
home
cairn
was
shown
into
the
long
room
which
contained
so
many
priceless
relics
of
a
past
civilisation
upon
the
bookcase
stood
the
stately
ranks
of
volumes
which
had
carried
the
fame
of
foremost
egyptologist
to
every
corner
of
the
civilised
world
this
queerly
furnished
room
held
many
memories
for
robert
cairn
who
had
known
it
from
childhood
but
latterly
it
had
always
appeared
to
him
in
his
daydreams
as
the
setting
for
a
dainty
figure
it
was
here
that
he
had
first
met
myra
duquesne
sir
michael
niece
when
fresh
from
a
norman
convent
she
had
come
to
shed
light
and
gladness
upon
the
somewhat
sombre
household
of
the
scholar
he
often
thought
of
that
day
he
could
recall
every
detail
of
the
meeting
myra
duquesne
came
in
pulling
aside
the
heavy
curtains
that
hung
in
the
arched
entrance
with
a
granite
osiris
flanking
her
slim
figure
on
one
side
and
a
gilded
sarcophagus
on
the
other
she
burst
upon
the
visitor
a
radiant
vision
in
white
the
light
gleamed
through
her
soft
brown
hair
forming
a
halo
for
a
face
that
robert
cairn
knew
for
the
sweetest
in
the
world
why
cairn
she
said
and
blushed
entrancingly
we
thought
you
had
forgotten
us
that
not
a
little
bit
likely
he
replied
taking
her
proffered
hand
and
there
was
that
in
his
voice
and
in
his
look
which
made
her
lower
her
frank
grey
eyes
i
have
only
been
in
london
a
few
days
and
i
find
that
press
work
is
more
exacting
than
i
had
anticipated
did
you
want
to
see
my
uncle
very
particularly
asked
myra
in
a
way
yes
i
suppose
he
could
not
manage
to
see
me
myra
shook
her
head
now
that
the
flush
of
excitement
had
left
her
face
cairn
was
concerned
to
see
how
pale
she
was
and
what
dark
shadows
lurked
beneath
her
eyes
sir
michael
is
not
seriously
ill
he
asked
quickly
only
one
of
the
visual
attacks
yes
at
least
it
began
with
one
she
hesitated
and
cairn
saw
to
his
consternation
that
her
eyes
became
filled
with
tears
the
real
loneliness
of
her
position
now
that
her
guardian
was
ill
the
absence
of
a
friend
in
whom
she
could
confide
her
fears
suddenly
grew
apparent
to
the
man
who
sat
watching
her
you
are
tired
out
he
said
gently
you
have
been
nursing
him
she
nodded
and
tried
to
smile
who
is
attending
sir
elwin
groves
but
shall
i
wire
for
my
father
we
wired
for
him
yesterday
what
to
paris
yes
at
my
uncle
wish
cairn
started
then
he
thinks
he
is
seriously
ill
himself
i
can
not
say
answered
the
girl
wearily
his
behaviour
is
queer
he
will
allow
no
one
in
his
room
and
barely
consents
to
see
sir
elwin
then
twice
recently
he
has
awakened
in
the
night
and
made
a
singular
request
what
is
that
he
has
asked
me
to
send
for
his
solicitor
in
the
morning
speaking
harshly
and
almost
as
though
he
hated
me
i
do
understand
have
you
complied
yes
and
on
each
occasion
he
has
refused
to
see
the
solicitor
when
he
has
arrived
i
gather
that
you
have
been
acting
as
i
remain
in
an
adjoining
room
he
is
always
worse
at
night
perhaps
it
is
telling
on
my
nerves
but
last
night
again
she
hesitated
as
though
doubting
the
wisdom
of
further
speech
but
a
brief
scrutiny
of
cairn
face
with
deep
anxiety
to
be
read
in
his
eyes
determined
her
to
proceed
i
had
been
asleep
and
i
must
have
been
dreaming
for
i
thought
that
a
voice
was
chanting
quite
near
to
me
chanting
yes
it
was
horrible
in
some
way
then
a
sensation
of
intense
coldness
came
it
was
as
though
some
icily
cold
creature
fanned
me
with
its
wings
i
can
not
describe
it
but
it
was
numbing
i
think
i
must
have
felt
as
those
poor
travellers
do
who
succumb
to
the
temptation
to
sleep
in
the
snow
cairn
surveyed
her
anxiously
for
in
its
essentials
this
might
be
a
symptom
of
a
dreadful
ailment
i
aroused
myself
however
she
continued
but
experienced
an
unaccountable
dread
of
entering
my
uncle
room
i
could
hear
him
muttering
strangely
and
i
forced
myself
to
enter
i
saw
oh
how
can
i
tell
you
you
will
think
me
mad
she
raised
her
hands
to
her
face
she
was
trembling
robert
cairn
took
them
in
his
own
forcing
her
to
look
up
tell
me
he
said
quietly
the
curtains
were
drawn
back
i
distinctly
remembered
having
closed
them
but
they
were
drawn
back
and
the
moonlight
was
shining
on
to
the
bed
bad
he
was
dreaming
but
was
dreaming
cairn
two
hands
were
stretched
out
over
my
uncle
two
hands
that
swayed
slowly
up
and
down
in
the
moonlight
cairn
leapt
to
his
feet
passing
his
hand
over
his
forehead
go
on
he
said
i
i
cried
out
but
not
loudly
i
think
i
was
very
near
to
swooning
the
hands
were
withdrawn
into
the
shadow
and
my
uncle
awoke
and
sat
up
he
asked
in
a
low
voice
if
i
were
there
and
i
ran
to
him
yes
he
ordered
me
very
coldly
to
for
his
solicitor
at
nine
this
morning
and
then
fell
back
and
was
asleep
again
almost
immediately
the
solicitor
came
and
was
with
him
for
nearly
an
hour
he
sent
for
one
of
his
clerks
and
they
both
went
away
at
ten
uncle
has
been
in
a
sort
of
dazed
condition
ever
since
in
fact
he
has
only
once
aroused
himself
to
ask
for
cairn
i
had
a
telegram
sent
immediately
the
governor
will
be
here
said
cairn
confidently
tell
me
the
hands
which
you
thought
you
saw
was
there
anything
peculiar
about
them
in
the
moonlight
they
seemed
to
be
of
a
dull
white
colour
there
was
a
ring
on
one
finger
a
green
ring
oh
she
shuddered
i
can
see
it
now
you
would
know
it
again
anywhere
actually
there
was
no
one
in
the
room
of
course
no
one
it
was
some
awful
illusion
but
i
can
never
forget
it
chapter
iii
the
ring
of
thoth
street
was
very
still
midnight
had
sounded
nearly
but
still
robert
cairn
paced
up
and
down
his
library
he
was
very
pale
and
many
times
he
glanced
at
a
book
which
lay
open
upon
the
table
finally
he
paused
before
it
and
read
once
again
certain
passages
in
the
year
it
recorded
the
notorious
trois
echelles
was
executed
in
the
place
de
gr√®ve
he
confessed
before
the
king
charles
ix
that
he
performed
marvels
admiral
de
coligny
who
also
was
present
recollected
the
death
of
two
gentlemen
he
added
that
they
were
found
black
and
swollen
he
turned
over
the
page
with
a
hand
none
too
steady
the
famous
mar√©chal
concini
concini
he
read
was
killed
by
a
pistol
shot
on
the
drawbridge
of
the
louvre
by
vitry
captain
of
the
bodyguard
on
the
of
april
it
was
proved
that
the
mar√©chal
and
his
wife
made
use
of
wax
images
which
they
kept
in
coffins
cairn
shut
the
book
hastily
and
began
to
pace
the
room
again
oh
it
is
utterly
fantastically
incredible
he
groaned
yet
with
my
own
eyes
i
saw
he
stepped
to
a
bookshelf
and
began
to
look
for
a
book
which
so
far
as
his
slight
knowledge
of
the
subject
bore
him
would
possibly
throw
light
upon
the
darkness
but
he
failed
to
find
it
despite
the
heat
of
the
weather
the
library
seemed
to
have
grown
chilly
he
pressed
the
bell
marston
he
said
to
the
man
who
presently
came
you
must
be
very
tired
but
cairn
will
be
here
within
an
hour
tell
him
that
i
have
gone
to
sir
michael
ferrara
but
it
after
twelve
sir
i
know
it
is
nevertheless
i
am
going
very
good
sir
you
will
wait
there
for
the
doctor
exactly
marston
sir
robert
cairn
went
out
into
street
the
night
was
perfect
and
the
cloudless
sky
lavishly
gemmed
with
stars
he
walked
on
heedlessly
scarce
noting
in
which
direction
an
awful
conviction
was
with
him
growing
stronger
each
moment
that
some
mysterious
menace
some
danger
unclassifiable
threatened
myra
duquesne
what
did
he
suspect
he
could
give
it
no
name
how
should
he
act
he
had
no
idea
sir
elwin
groves
whom
he
had
seen
that
evening
had
hinted
broadly
at
mental
trouble
as
the
solution
of
sir
michael
ferrara
peculiar
symptoms
although
sir
michael
had
had
certain
transactions
with
his
solicitor
during
the
early
morning
he
had
apparently
forgotten
all
about
the
matter
according
to
the
celebrated
physician
between
ourselves
cairn
sir
elwin
had
confided
i
believe
he
altered
his
will
the
inquiry
of
a
taxi
driver
interrupted
cairn
meditations
he
entered
the
vehicle
giving
sir
michael
ferrara
address
his
thoughts
persistently
turned
to
myra
duquesne
who
at
that
moment
would
be
lying
listening
for
the
slightest
sound
from
the
who
would
be
fighting
down
fear
that
she
might
do
her
duty
to
her
guardian
fear
of
the
waving
phantom
hands
the
cab
sped
through
the
almost
empty
streets
and
at
last
rounding
a
corner
rolled
up
the
avenue
past
three
or
four
houses
lighted
only
by
the
glitter
of
the
moon
and
came
to
a
stop
before
that
of
sir
michael
ferrara
lights
shone
from
the
many
windows
the
front
door
was
open
and
light
streamed
out
into
the
porch
my
god
cried
cairn
leaping
from
the
cab
my
god
what
has
happened
a
thousand
fears
a
thousand
reproaches
flooded
his
brain
with
frenzy
he
went
racing
up
to
the
steps
and
almost
threw
himself
upon
the
man
who
stood
in
the
doorway
felton
felton
he
whispered
hoarsely
what
has
happened
who
sir
michael
sir
answered
the
man
i
thought
his
voice
broke
you
were
the
doctor
sir
miss
myra
she
fainted
away
sir
hume
is
with
her
in
the
library
now
cairn
thrust
past
the
servant
and
ran
into
the
library
the
housekeeper
and
a
trembling
maid
were
bending
over
myra
duquesne
who
lay
fully
dressed
white
and
still
upon
a
chesterfield
cairn
unceremoniously
grasped
her
wrist
dropped
upon
his
knees
and
placed
his
ear
to
the
still
breast
thank
god
he
said
it
is
only
a
swoon
look
after
her
mrs
hume
the
housekeeper
with
set
face
lowered
her
head
but
did
not
trust
herself
to
speak
cairn
went
out
into
the
hall
and
tapped
felton
on
the
shoulder
the
man
turned
with
a
great
start
what
happened
he
demanded
is
sir
michael
felton
nodded
five
minutes
before
you
came
sir
his
voice
was
hoarse
with
emotion
miss
myra
came
out
of
her
room
she
thought
someone
called
her
she
rapped
on
hume
door
and
hume
who
was
just
retiring
opened
it
she
also
thought
she
had
heard
someone
calling
miss
myra
out
on
the
stairhead
well
there
was
no
one
there
sir
everyone
was
in
bed
i
was
just
undressing
myself
but
there
was
a
sort
of
faint
perfume
something
like
a
church
only
disgusting
sir
how
disgusting
did
smell
it
no
sir
never
hume
and
miss
myra
have
noticed
it
in
the
house
on
other
nights
and
one
of
the
maids
too
it
was
very
strong
told
last
night
well
sir
as
they
stood
by
the
door
they
heard
a
horrid
kind
of
choking
scream
they
both
rushed
to
sir
room
and
yes
yes
he
was
lying
half
out
of
bed
sir
dead
seemed
like
he
been
strangled
they
told
me
and
who
is
with
him
now
the
man
grew
even
paler
no
one
cairn
sir
miss
myra
screamed
out
that
there
were
two
hands
just
unfastening
from
his
throat
as
she
and
hume
got
to
the
door
and
there
was
no
living
soul
in
the
room
sir
i
might
as
well
out
with
it
we
all
afraid
to
go
in
cairn
turned
and
ran
up
the
stairs
the
upper
landing
was
in
darkness
and
the
door
of
the
room
which
he
knew
to
be
sir
michael
stood
wide
open
as
he
entered
a
faint
scent
came
to
his
nostrils
it
brought
him
up
short
at
the
threshold
with
a
chill
of
supernatural
dread
the
bed
was
placed
between
the
windows
and
one
curtain
had
been
pulled
aside
admitting
a
flood
of
moonlight
cairn
remembered
that
myra
had
mentioned
this
circumstance
in
connection
with
the
disturbance
of
the
previous
night
who
in
god
name
opened
that
curtain
he
muttered
fully
in
the
cold
white
light
lay
sir
michael
ferrara
his
silver
hair
gleaming
and
his
strong
angular
face
upturned
to
the
intruding
rays
his
glazed
eyes
were
starting
from
their
sockets
his
face
was
nearly
black
and
his
fingers
were
clutching
the
sheets
in
a
death
grip
cairn
had
need
of
all
his
courage
to
touch
him
he
was
quite
dead
someone
was
running
up
the
stairs
cairn
turned
half
dazed
anticipating
the
entrance
of
a
local
medical
man
into
the
room
ran
his
father
switching
on
the
light
as
he
did
so
a
greyish
tinge
showed
through
his
ruddy
complexion
he
scarcely
noticed
his
son
ferrara
he
cried
coming
up
to
the
bed
ferrara
he
dropped
on
his
knees
beside
the
dead
man
ferrara
old
fellow
his
cry
ended
in
something
like
a
sob
robert
cairn
turned
choking
and
went
downstairs
in
the
hall
stood
felton
and
some
other
servants
miss
duquesne
she
has
recovered
sir
hume
has
taken
her
to
another
bedroom
cairn
hesitated
then
walked
into
the
deserted
library
where
a
light
was
burning
he
began
to
pace
up
and
down
clenching
and
unclenching
his
fists
presently
felton
knocked
and
entered
clearly
the
man
was
glad
of
the
chance
to
talk
to
someone
antony
has
been
at
oxford
sir
i
thought
you
might
like
to
know
he
is
motoring
down
sir
and
will
be
here
at
four
thank
you
said
cairn
shortly
ten
minutes
later
his
father
joined
him
he
was
a
slim
man
and
active
yet
he
had
aged
five
years
in
his
eyes
his
face
was
unusually
pale
but
he
exhibited
no
other
signs
of
emotion
well
rob
he
said
tersely
i
can
see
you
have
something
to
tell
me
i
am
listening
robert
cairn
leant
back
against
a
bookshelf
i
something
to
tell
you
sir
and
something
to
ask
you
tell
your
story
first
then
ask
your
question
my
story
begins
in
a
thames
backwater
cairn
stared
squaring
his
jaw
but
his
son
proceeded
to
relate
with
some
detail
the
circumstances
attendant
upon
the
death
of
the
he
went
on
to
recount
what
took
place
in
antony
rooms
and
at
the
point
where
something
had
been
taken
from
the
table
and
thrown
in
the
fire
stop
said
cairn
what
did
he
throw
in
the
fire
the
doctor
nostrils
quivered
and
his
eyes
were
ablaze
with
some
hardly
repressed
emotion
i
can
not
swear
to
it
sir
never
mind
what
do
you
he
threw
in
the
fire
a
little
image
of
wax
or
something
similar
an
image
of
a
swan
at
that
despite
his
cairn
became
so
pale
that
his
son
leapt
forward
all
right
rob
his
father
waved
him
away
and
turning
walked
slowly
down
the
room
go
on
he
said
rather
huskily
robert
cairn
continued
his
story
up
to
the
time
that
he
visited
the
hospital
where
the
dead
girl
lay
you
can
swear
that
she
was
the
original
of
the
photograph
in
rooms
and
the
same
who
was
waiting
at
the
foot
of
the
stair
i
can
sir
go
on
again
the
younger
man
resumed
his
story
relating
what
he
had
learnt
from
myra
duquesne
what
she
had
told
him
about
the
phantom
hands
what
felton
had
told
him
about
the
strange
perfume
perceptible
in
the
house
the
ring
interrupted
cairn
she
would
recognise
it
again
she
says
so
anything
else
only
that
if
some
of
your
books
are
to
be
believed
sir
trois
echelle
and
others
have
gone
to
the
stake
for
such
things
in
a
less
enlightened
age
less
enlightened
boy
cairn
turned
his
blazing
eyes
upon
him
enlightened
where
the
powers
of
hell
were
concerned
then
you
think
have
i
spent
half
my
life
in
such
studies
in
vain
did
i
labour
with
poor
michael
ferrara
in
egypt
and
learn
just
god
what
an
end
to
his
labour
what
a
reward
for
mine
he
buried
his
face
in
quivering
hands
i
can
not
tell
exactly
what
you
mean
by
that
sir
said
robert
cairn
but
it
brings
me
to
my
question
cairn
did
not
speak
did
not
move
is
antony
the
doctor
looked
up
at
that
and
it
was
a
haggard
face
he
raised
from
his
hands
you
have
tried
to
ask
me
that
before
i
ask
now
sir
with
better
prospect
of
receiving
an
answer
yet
i
can
give
you
none
rob
why
sir
are
you
bound
to
secrecy
in
a
degree
yes
but
the
real
reason
is
this
i
do
know
you
do
know
i
have
said
so
good
god
sir
you
amaze
me
i
have
always
felt
certain
that
he
was
really
no
ferrara
but
an
adopted
son
yet
it
had
never
entered
my
mind
that
you
were
ignorant
of
his
origin
you
have
not
studied
the
subjects
which
i
have
studied
nor
do
i
wish
that
you
should
therefore
it
is
impossible
at
any
rate
now
to
pursue
that
matter
further
but
i
may
perhaps
supplement
your
researches
into
the
history
of
trois
echelles
and
concini
concini
i
believe
you
told
me
that
you
were
looking
in
my
library
for
some
work
which
you
failed
to
find
i
was
looking
for
chabas
translation
of
the
what
do
you
know
of
it
i
once
saw
a
copy
in
antony
ferrara
rooms
cairn
started
slightly
indeed
it
happens
that
my
copy
is
here
i
lent
it
quite
recently
to
sir
michael
it
is
probably
somewhere
on
the
shelves
he
turned
on
more
lights
and
began
to
scan
the
rows
of
books
presently
here
it
is
he
said
and
took
down
and
opened
the
book
on
the
table
this
passage
may
interest
you
he
laid
his
finger
upon
it
his
son
bent
over
the
book
and
read
the
following
hai
the
evil
man
was
a
shepherd
he
had
said
that
i
might
have
a
book
of
spells
that
would
give
me
resistless
power
he
obtained
a
book
of
the
formulas
by
the
divine
powers
of
these
he
enchanted
men
he
obtained
a
deep
vault
furnished
with
implements
he
made
waxen
images
of
men
and
and
then
he
perpetrated
all
the
horrors
that
his
heart
conceived
flinders
petrie
said
cairn
mentions
the
book
of
thoth
as
another
magical
work
conferring
similar
powers
but
surely
sir
after
all
it
the
twentieth
century
this
is
mere
superstition
i
thought
so
replied
cairn
but
i
have
lived
to
know
that
egyptian
magic
was
a
real
and
a
potent
force
a
great
part
of
it
was
no
more
than
a
kind
of
hypnotism
but
there
were
other
branches
our
most
learned
modern
works
are
as
children
nursery
rhymes
beside
such
a
writing
as
the
egyptian
of
the
god
forgive
me
what
have
i
done
you
can
not
reproach
yourself
in
any
way
sir
can
i
not
said
cairn
hoarsely
ah
rob
you
do
know
there
came
a
rap
on
the
door
and
a
local
practitioner
entered
this
is
a
singular
case
cairn
he
began
diffidently
an
autopsy
nonsense
cried
cairn
sir
elwin
groves
had
foreseen
it
so
had
i
but
there
are
distinct
marks
of
pressure
on
either
side
of
the
windpipe
certainly
these
marks
are
not
uncommon
in
such
cases
sir
michael
had
resided
in
the
east
and
had
contracted
a
form
of
plague
virtually
he
died
from
it
the
thing
is
highly
contagious
and
it
is
almost
impossible
to
rid
the
system
of
it
a
girl
died
in
one
of
the
hospitals
this
week
having
identical
marks
on
the
throat
he
turned
to
his
son
you
saw
her
rob
robert
cairn
nodded
and
finally
the
local
man
withdrew
highly
mystified
but
unable
to
contradict
so
celebrated
a
physician
as
bruce
cairn
the
latter
seated
himself
in
an
armchair
and
rested
his
chin
in
the
palm
of
his
left
hand
robert
cairn
paced
restlessly
about
the
library
both
were
waiting
expectantly
at
two
felton
brought
in
a
tray
of
refreshments
but
neither
of
the
men
attempted
to
avail
themselves
of
the
hospitality
miss
duquesne
asked
the
younger
she
has
just
gone
to
sleep
sir
good
muttered
cairn
blessed
is
youth
silence
fell
again
upon
the
man
departure
to
be
broken
but
rarely
despite
the
tumultuous
thoughts
of
those
two
minds
until
at
about
a
quarter
to
three
the
faint
sound
of
a
throbbing
motor
brought
cairn
sharply
to
his
feet
he
looked
towards
the
window
dawn
was
breaking
the
car
came
roaring
along
the
avenue
and
stopped
outside
the
house
cairn
and
his
son
glanced
at
one
another
a
brief
tumult
and
hurried
exchange
of
words
sounded
in
the
hall
footsteps
were
heard
ascending
the
stairs
then
came
silence
the
two
stood
side
by
side
in
front
of
the
empty
hearth
a
haggard
pair
fitly
set
in
that
desolate
room
with
the
yellowing
rays
of
the
lamps
shrinking
before
the
first
spears
of
dawn
then
without
warning
the
door
opened
slowly
and
deliberately
and
antony
ferrara
came
in
his
face
was
expressionless
ivory
his
red
lips
were
firm
and
he
drooped
his
head
but
the
long
black
eyes
glinted
and
gleamed
as
if
they
reflected
the
glow
from
a
furnace
he
wore
a
motor
coat
lined
with
leopard
skin
and
he
was
pulling
off
his
heavy
gloves
it
is
good
of
you
to
have
waited
doctor
he
said
in
his
huskily
musical
voice
you
too
cairn
he
advanced
a
few
steps
into
the
room
cairn
was
conscious
of
a
kind
of
fear
but
uppermost
came
a
desire
to
pick
up
some
heavy
implement
and
crush
this
evilly
effeminate
thing
with
the
serpent
eyes
then
he
found
himself
speaking
the
words
seemed
to
be
forced
from
his
throat
antony
ferrara
he
said
have
you
read
the
ferrara
dropped
his
glove
stooped
and
recovered
it
and
smiled
faintly
no
he
replied
have
you
his
eyes
were
nearly
closed
mere
luminous
slits
but
surely
he
continued
this
is
no
time
cairn
to
discuss
books
as
my
poor
father
heir
and
therefore
your
host
i
beg
of
you
to
partake
a
faint
sound
made
him
turn
just
within
the
door
where
the
light
from
the
reddening
library
windows
touched
her
as
if
with
sanctity
stood
myra
duquesne
in
her
night
robe
her
hair
unbound
and
her
little
bare
feet
gleaming
whitely
upon
the
red
carpet
her
eyes
were
wide
open
vacant
of
expression
but
set
upon
antony
ungloved
left
hand
ferrara
turned
slowly
to
face
her
until
his
back
was
towards
the
two
men
in
the
library
she
began
to
speak
in
a
toneless
unemotional
voice
raising
her
finger
and
pointing
at
a
ring
which
ferrara
wore
i
know
you
now
she
said
i
know
you
son
of
an
evil
woman
for
you
wear
her
ring
the
sacred
ring
of
thoth
you
have
stained
that
ring
with
blood
as
she
stained
it
with
the
blood
of
those
who
loved
and
trusted
you
i
could
name
you
but
my
lips
are
sealed
i
could
name
you
brood
of
a
witch
murderer
for
i
know
you
now
dispassionately
mechanically
she
delivered
her
strange
indictment
over
her
shoulder
appeared
the
anxious
face
of
hume
finger
to
lip
my
god
muttered
cairn
my
god
what
s
sh
his
father
grasped
his
arm
she
is
asleep
myra
duquesne
turned
and
quitted
the
room
hume
hovering
anxiously
about
her
antony
ferrara
faced
around
his
mouth
was
oddly
twisted
she
is
troubled
with
strange
dreams
he
said
very
huskily
clairvoyant
dreams
cairn
addressed
him
for
the
first
time
do
not
glare
at
me
in
that
way
for
it
may
be
that
know
you
too
come
rob
but
myra
cairn
laid
his
hand
upon
his
son
shoulder
fixing
his
eyes
upon
him
steadily
nothing
in
this
house
can
injure
myra
he
replied
quietly
for
good
is
higher
than
evil
for
the
present
we
can
only
go
antony
ferrara
stood
aside
as
the
two
walked
out
of
the
library
chapter
iv
at
ferrara
chambers
bruce
cairn
swung
around
in
his
chair
lifting
his
heavy
eyebrows
interrogatively
as
his
son
robert
entered
the
street
was
bathed
in
almost
tropical
sunlight
but
already
the
celebrated
physician
had
sent
those
out
from
his
house
to
whom
the
sky
was
overcast
whom
the
sun
would
gladden
no
more
and
a
group
of
sufferers
yet
awaited
his
scrutiny
in
an
adjoining
room
hullo
rob
do
you
wish
to
see
me
professionally
robert
cairn
seated
himself
upon
a
corner
of
the
big
table
shaking
his
head
slowly
no
thanks
sir
i
fit
enough
but
i
thought
you
might
like
to
know
about
the
will
i
do
know
since
i
was
largely
interested
jermyn
attended
on
my
behalf
an
urgent
case
detained
me
he
rang
up
earlier
this
morning
oh
i
see
then
perhaps
i
wasting
your
time
but
it
was
a
surprise
quite
a
pleasant
one
to
find
that
sir
michael
had
provided
for
myra
miss
duquesne
cairn
stared
hard
what
led
you
to
suppose
that
he
had
provided
for
his
niece
she
is
an
orphan
and
he
was
her
guardian
of
course
he
should
have
done
so
but
i
was
not
alone
in
my
belief
that
during
the
peculiar
state
of
mind
which
preceded
his
death
he
had
altered
his
will
in
favour
of
his
adopted
son
antony
yes
i
know
were
afraid
of
it
sir
but
as
it
turns
out
they
inherit
equal
shares
and
the
house
goes
to
myra
antony
ferrara
he
accentuated
the
name
quite
failed
to
conceal
his
chagrin
indeed
rather
he
was
there
in
person
wearing
one
of
his
beastly
fur
coats
a
fur
coat
with
the
thermometer
at
africa
lined
with
of
all
abominations
cairn
turned
to
his
table
tapping
at
the
with
the
tube
of
a
stethoscope
i
regret
your
attitude
towards
young
ferrara
rob
his
son
started
regret
it
i
do
understand
why
you
yourself
brought
about
an
open
rupture
on
the
night
of
sir
michael
death
nevertheless
i
am
sorry
you
know
since
you
were
present
that
sir
michael
has
left
his
niece
to
my
care
thank
god
for
that
i
am
glad
too
although
there
are
many
difficulties
but
furthermore
he
enjoined
me
to
keep
an
eye
on
antony
yes
yes
but
heavens
he
did
know
him
for
what
he
is
cairn
turned
to
him
again
he
did
not
by
a
divine
mercy
he
never
knew
what
we
know
but
his
clear
eyes
were
raised
to
his
son
the
charge
is
none
the
less
sacred
boy
the
younger
man
stared
perplexedly
but
he
is
nothing
less
than
a
his
father
upraised
hand
checked
the
word
on
his
tongue
know
what
he
is
rob
even
better
than
you
do
but
can
not
you
see
how
this
ties
my
hands
seals
my
lips
robert
cairn
was
silent
stupefied
give
me
time
to
see
my
way
clearly
rob
at
the
moment
i
can
not
reconcile
my
duty
and
my
conscience
i
confess
it
but
give
me
time
if
only
as
a
move
as
a
matter
of
policy
keep
in
touch
with
ferrara
you
loathe
him
i
know
but
we
watch
him
there
are
other
interests
myra
robert
cairn
flushed
hotly
yes
i
see
i
understand
by
heavens
it
a
hard
part
to
play
but
be
advised
by
me
rob
meet
stealth
with
stealth
my
boy
we
have
seen
strange
ends
come
to
those
who
stood
in
the
path
of
someone
if
you
had
studied
the
subjects
that
i
have
studied
you
would
know
that
retribution
though
slow
is
inevitable
but
be
on
your
guard
i
am
taking
precautions
we
have
an
enemy
i
do
not
pretend
to
deny
it
and
he
fights
with
strange
weapons
perhaps
i
know
something
of
those
weapons
too
and
i
am
adopting
certain
measures
but
one
defence
and
the
one
for
you
is
guile
stealth
robert
cairn
spoke
abruptly
he
is
installed
in
palatial
chambers
in
piccadilly
have
you
been
there
no
call
upon
him
take
the
first
opportunity
to
do
so
had
it
not
been
for
your
knowledge
of
certain
things
which
happened
in
a
top
set
at
oxford
we
might
be
groping
in
the
dark
now
you
never
liked
antony
ferrara
no
men
do
but
you
used
to
call
upon
him
in
college
continue
to
call
upon
him
in
town
robert
cairn
stood
up
and
lighted
a
cigarette
right
you
are
sir
he
said
i
glad
i
not
alone
in
this
thing
by
the
way
about
myra
for
the
present
she
remains
at
the
house
there
is
hume
and
all
the
old
servants
we
shall
see
what
is
to
be
done
later
you
might
run
over
and
give
her
a
though
i
will
sir
said
cairn
and
pressed
the
bell
which
summoned
marston
to
usher
out
the
caller
and
usher
in
the
next
patient
in
street
robert
cairn
stood
irresolute
for
he
was
one
of
those
whose
mental
moods
are
physically
reflected
he
might
call
upon
myra
duquesne
in
which
event
he
would
almost
certainly
be
asked
to
stay
to
lunch
or
he
might
call
upon
antony
ferrara
he
determined
upon
the
latter
though
less
pleasant
course
turning
his
steps
in
the
direction
of
piccadilly
he
reflected
that
this
grim
and
uncanny
secret
which
he
shared
with
his
father
was
like
to
prove
prejudicial
to
his
success
in
journalism
it
was
eternally
uprising
demoniac
between
himself
and
his
work
the
feeling
of
fierce
resentment
towards
antony
ferrara
which
he
cherished
grew
stronger
at
every
step
was
the
spider
governing
the
web
the
web
that
clammily
touched
cairn
himself
robert
cairn
and
myra
duquesne
others
there
had
been
who
had
felt
its
touch
who
had
been
drawn
to
the
heart
of
the
unclean
labyrinth
and
devoured
in
the
mind
of
cairn
the
figure
of
antony
ferrara
assumed
the
shape
of
a
monster
a
ghoul
an
elemental
spirit
of
evil
and
now
he
was
ascending
the
marble
steps
before
the
gates
of
the
lift
he
stood
and
pressed
the
bell
ferrara
proved
to
be
a
suite
and
the
doors
were
opened
by
an
eastern
servant
dressed
in
white
his
beastly
theatrical
affectation
again
muttered
cairn
the
man
should
have
been
a
illusionist
the
visitor
was
salaamed
into
a
small
reception
room
of
this
apartment
the
walls
and
ceiling
were
entirely
covered
by
a
fretwork
in
sandalwood
evidently
oriental
in
workmanship
in
niches
or
doorless
stood
vases
and
pots
heavy
curtains
of
rich
fabric
draped
the
doors
the
floor
was
of
mosaic
and
a
small
fountain
played
in
the
centre
a
cushioned
divan
occupied
one
side
of
the
place
from
which
natural
light
was
entirely
excluded
and
which
was
illuminated
only
by
an
ornate
lantern
swung
from
the
ceiling
this
lantern
had
panes
of
blue
glass
producing
a
singular
effect
a
silver
or
stood
near
to
one
corner
of
the
divan
and
emitted
a
subtle
perfume
as
the
servant
withdrew
good
heavens
muttered
cairn
disgustedly
poor
sir
fortune
wo
last
long
at
this
rate
he
glanced
at
the
smoking
phew
effeminate
beast
ambergris
no
more
singular
anomaly
could
well
be
pictured
than
that
afforded
by
the
lean
scotsman
with
his
fresh
face
and
typically
british
air
in
this
setting
of
eastern
voluptuousness
the
dusky
servitor
drew
back
a
curtain
and
waved
him
to
enter
bowing
low
as
the
visitor
passed
cairn
found
himself
in
antony
study
a
huge
fire
was
blazing
in
the
grate
rendering
the
heat
of
the
study
almost
insufferable
it
was
he
perceived
an
elaborated
copy
of
ferrara
room
at
oxford
infinitely
more
spacious
of
course
and
by
reason
of
the
rugs
cushions
and
carpets
with
which
its
floor
was
strewn
suggestive
of
great
opulence
but
the
littered
table
was
there
with
its
nameless
instruments
and
its
extraordinary
silver
lamp
the
mummies
were
there
the
antique
volumes
rolls
of
papyrus
preserved
snakes
and
cats
and
ibises
statuettes
of
isis
osiris
and
other
nile
deities
were
there
the
many
photographs
of
women
too
cairn
had
dubbed
it
at
oxford
the
zenana
above
all
there
was
antony
ferrara
he
wore
the
trimmed
with
white
swansdown
in
which
cairn
had
seen
him
before
his
statuesque
ivory
face
was
set
in
a
smile
which
yet
was
no
smile
of
welcome
the
lips
smiled
alone
the
long
glittering
dark
eyes
were
joyless
almost
beneath
the
brows
sinister
save
for
the
short
lustreless
hair
it
was
the
face
of
a
handsome
evil
woman
my
dear
cairn
what
a
welcome
interruption
how
good
of
you
there
was
strange
music
in
his
husky
tones
he
spoke
unemotionally
falsely
but
cairn
could
not
deny
the
charm
of
that
unique
voice
it
was
possible
to
understand
how
women
some
women
would
be
as
clay
in
the
hands
of
the
man
who
had
such
a
voice
as
that
his
visitor
nodded
shortly
cairn
was
a
poor
actor
already
his
was
oppressing
him
whilst
ferrara
was
speaking
one
found
a
sort
of
fascination
in
listening
but
when
he
was
silent
he
repelled
ferrara
may
have
been
conscious
of
this
for
he
spoke
much
and
well
you
have
made
yourself
jolly
comfortable
said
cairn
why
not
my
dear
cairn
every
man
has
within
him
something
of
the
sybarite
why
crush
a
propensity
so
delightful
the
spartan
philosophy
is
palpably
absurd
it
is
that
of
one
who
finds
himself
in
a
garden
filled
with
roses
and
who
holds
his
nostrils
who
perceives
there
shady
bowers
but
chooses
to
burn
in
the
sun
who
ignoring
the
choice
fruits
which
tempt
his
hand
and
court
his
palate
stoops
to
pluck
bitter
herbs
from
the
wayside
i
see
snapped
cairn
are
you
thinking
of
doing
any
more
work
then
work
antony
ferrara
smiled
and
sank
upon
a
heap
of
cushions
forgive
me
cairn
but
i
leave
it
gladly
and
confidently
to
more
robust
characters
such
as
your
own
he
proffered
a
silver
box
of
cigarettes
but
cairn
shook
his
head
balancing
himself
on
a
corner
of
the
table
no
thanks
i
have
smoked
too
much
already
my
tongue
is
parched
my
dear
fellow
ferrara
rose
i
have
a
wine
which
i
declare
you
will
never
have
tasted
but
which
you
will
pronounce
to
be
nectar
it
is
made
in
cyprus
cairn
raised
his
hand
in
a
way
that
might
have
reminded
a
nice
observer
of
his
father
thank
you
nevertheless
some
other
time
ferrara
i
am
no
wine
man
a
whisky
and
soda
or
a
burly
british
and
even
a
sporty
and
polly
there
was
a
suggestion
of
laughter
in
the
husky
voice
now
of
a
sort
of
contemptuous
banter
but
cairn
stolidly
shook
his
head
and
forced
a
smile
many
thanks
but
it
too
early
he
stood
up
and
began
to
walk
about
the
room
inspecting
the
numberless
oddities
which
it
contained
the
photographs
he
examined
with
supercilious
curiosity
then
passing
to
a
huge
cabinet
he
began
to
peer
in
at
the
rows
of
amulets
statuettes
and
other
unclassifiable
objects
with
which
it
was
laden
ferrara
voice
came
that
head
of
a
priestess
on
the
left
cairn
is
of
great
interest
the
brain
had
not
been
removed
and
quite
a
colony
of
dermestes
beetles
had
propagated
in
the
cavity
those
creatures
never
saw
the
light
cairn
yet
i
assure
you
that
they
had
eyes
i
have
nearly
forty
of
them
in
the
small
glass
case
on
the
table
there
you
might
like
to
examine
them
cairn
shuddered
but
felt
impelled
to
turn
and
look
at
these
gruesome
relics
in
a
square
glass
case
he
saw
the
creatures
they
lay
in
rows
on
a
bed
of
moss
one
might
almost
have
supposed
that
unclean
life
yet
survived
in
the
little
black
insects
they
were
an
unfamiliar
species
to
cairn
being
covered
with
unusually
long
black
hair
except
upon
the
root
of
the
where
they
were
of
brilliant
orange
the
perfect
pup√¶
of
this
insect
are
extremely
rare
added
ferrara
informatively
indeed
replied
cairn
he
found
something
physically
revolting
in
that
group
of
beetles
whose
history
had
begun
and
ended
in
the
skull
of
a
mummy
filthy
things
he
said
why
do
you
keep
them
ferrara
shrugged
his
shoulders
who
knows
he
answered
enigmatically
they
might
prove
useful
some
day
a
bell
rang
and
from
ferrara
attitude
it
occurred
to
cairn
that
he
was
expecting
a
visitor
i
must
be
off
he
said
accordingly
and
indeed
he
was
conscious
of
a
craving
for
the
cool
and
comparatively
clean
air
of
piccadilly
he
knew
something
of
the
great
evil
which
dwelt
within
this
man
whom
he
was
compelled
by
singular
circumstances
to
tolerate
but
the
duty
began
to
irk
if
you
must
was
the
reply
of
course
your
press
work
no
doubt
is
very
exacting
the
note
of
badinage
was
discernible
again
but
cairn
passed
out
into
the
without
replying
where
the
fountain
plashed
coolly
and
the
silver
sent
up
its
pencils
of
vapour
the
outer
door
was
opened
by
the
oriental
servant
and
ferrara
stood
and
bowed
to
his
departing
visitor
he
did
not
proffer
his
hand
until
our
next
meeting
cairn
peace
be
with
you
he
murmured
as
the
moslems
say
but
indeed
i
shall
be
with
you
in
spirit
dear
cairn
there
was
something
in
the
tone
wherein
he
spoke
those
last
words
that
brought
cairn
up
short
he
turned
but
the
doors
closed
silently
a
faint
breath
of
ambergris
was
borne
to
his
nostrils
chapter
v
the
rustling
shadows
cairn
stepped
out
of
the
lift
crossed
the
hall
and
was
about
to
walk
out
on
to
piccadilly
when
he
stopped
staring
hard
at
a
which
had
slowed
down
upon
the
opposite
side
whilst
the
driver
awaited
a
suitable
opportunity
to
pull
across
the
occupant
of
the
cab
was
invisible
now
but
a
moment
before
cairn
had
had
a
glimpse
of
her
as
she
glanced
out
apparently
towards
the
very
doorway
in
which
he
stood
perhaps
his
imagination
was
playing
him
tricks
he
stood
and
waited
until
at
last
the
cab
drew
up
within
a
few
yards
of
him
myra
duquesne
got
out
having
paid
the
cabman
she
crossed
the
pavement
and
entered
the
cairn
stepped
forward
so
that
she
almost
ran
into
his
arms
mr
cairn
she
cried
why
have
you
been
to
see
antony
i
have
he
replied
and
paused
at
a
loss
for
words
it
had
suddenly
occurred
to
him
that
antony
ferrara
and
myra
duquesne
had
known
one
another
from
childhood
that
the
girl
probably
regarded
ferrara
in
the
light
of
a
brother
there
are
so
many
things
i
want
to
talk
to
him
about
she
said
he
seems
to
know
everything
and
i
am
afraid
i
know
very
little
cairn
noted
with
dismay
the
shadows
under
her
eyes
the
grey
eyes
that
he
would
have
wished
to
see
ever
full
of
light
and
laughter
she
was
pale
too
or
seemed
unusually
so
in
her
black
dress
but
the
tragic
death
of
her
guardian
sir
michael
ferrara
had
been
a
dreadful
blow
to
this
girl
who
had
no
other
kin
in
the
world
a
longing
swept
into
cairn
heart
and
set
it
ablaze
a
longing
to
take
all
her
sorrows
all
her
cares
upon
his
own
broad
shoulders
to
take
her
and
hold
her
shielded
from
whatever
of
trouble
or
menace
the
future
might
bring
have
you
seen
his
rooms
here
he
asked
trying
to
speak
casually
but
his
soul
was
up
in
arms
against
the
bare
idea
of
this
entering
that
perfumed
place
where
abominable
and
vile
things
were
and
none
of
them
so
vile
as
the
man
she
trusted
whom
she
counted
a
brother
not
yet
she
answered
with
a
sort
of
childish
glee
momentarily
lighting
her
eyes
are
they
splendid
very
he
answered
her
grimly
ca
you
come
in
with
me
for
awhile
only
just
a
little
while
then
you
can
come
home
to
lunch
you
and
antony
her
eyes
sparkled
now
oh
do
say
yes
knowing
what
he
did
know
of
the
man
upstairs
he
longed
to
accompany
her
yet
contradictorily
knowing
what
he
did
he
could
not
face
him
again
could
not
submit
himself
to
the
test
of
being
civil
to
antony
ferrara
in
the
presence
of
myra
duquesne
please
do
tempt
me
he
begged
and
forced
a
smile
i
shall
find
myself
enrolled
amongst
the
seekers
of
if
i
ignore
the
claims
of
my
employer
upon
my
time
oh
what
a
shame
she
cried
their
eyes
met
and
something
something
unspoken
but
cogent
passed
between
them
so
that
for
the
first
time
a
pretty
colour
tinted
the
girl
cheeks
she
suddenly
grew
embarrassed
then
she
said
holding
out
her
hand
will
you
lunch
with
us
thanks
awfully
replied
cairn
rather
if
it
humanly
possible
i
ring
you
up
he
released
her
hand
and
stood
watching
her
as
she
entered
the
lift
when
it
ascended
he
turned
and
went
out
to
swell
the
human
tide
of
piccadilly
he
wondered
what
his
father
would
think
of
the
visiting
ferrara
would
he
approve
decidedly
the
situation
was
a
delicate
one
the
wrong
kind
of
interference
the
tactless
kind
might
merely
render
it
worse
it
would
be
awfully
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
explain
to
myra
if
an
open
rupture
were
to
be
avoided
and
he
had
profound
faith
in
his
father
acumen
then
myra
must
remain
in
ignorance
but
was
she
to
be
allowed
to
continue
these
visits
should
he
have
permitted
her
to
enter
ferrara
rooms
he
reflected
that
he
had
no
right
to
question
her
movements
but
at
least
he
might
have
accompanied
her
oh
heavens
he
muttered
what
a
horrible
tangle
it
will
drive
me
mad
there
could
be
no
peace
for
him
until
he
knew
her
to
be
safely
home
again
and
his
work
suffered
accordingly
until
at
about
midday
he
rang
up
myra
duquesne
on
the
pretence
of
accepting
her
invitation
to
lunch
on
the
morrow
and
heard
with
inexpressible
relief
her
voice
replying
to
him
in
the
afternoon
he
was
suddenly
called
upon
to
do
a
big
royal
matin√©e
and
this
necessitated
a
run
to
his
chambers
in
order
to
change
from
harris
tweed
into
vicuna
and
cashmere
the
usual
stream
of
lawyers
clerks
and
others
poured
under
the
archway
leading
to
the
court
but
in
the
far
corner
shaded
by
the
tall
plane
tree
where
the
ascending
steps
and
worn
iron
railing
the
small
panes
of
glass
in
the
solicitor
window
on
the
ground
floor
and
the
general
air
of
aloofness
prevailed
one
entered
a
sort
of
backwater
in
the
narrow
quiet
reigned
a
quiet
profound
as
though
motor
were
not
cairn
ran
up
the
stairs
to
the
second
landing
and
began
to
fumble
for
his
key
although
he
knew
it
to
be
impossible
he
was
aware
of
a
queer
impression
that
someone
was
waiting
for
him
inside
his
chambers
the
sufficiently
palpable
fact
that
such
a
thing
impossible
did
not
really
strike
him
until
he
had
opened
the
door
and
entered
up
to
that
time
in
a
sort
of
subconscious
way
he
had
anticipated
finding
a
visitor
there
what
an
ass
i
am
he
muttered
then
phew
there
a
disgusting
smell
he
threw
open
all
the
windows
and
entering
his
bedroom
also
opening
both
the
windows
there
the
current
of
air
thus
established
began
to
disperse
the
odour
a
fusty
one
as
of
something
decaying
and
by
the
time
that
he
had
changed
it
was
scarcely
perceptible
he
had
little
time
to
waste
in
speculation
but
when
as
he
ran
out
to
the
door
glancing
at
his
watch
the
nauseous
odour
suddenly
rose
again
to
his
nostrils
he
stopped
with
his
hand
on
the
latch
what
the
deuce
is
it
he
said
loudly
quite
mechanically
he
turned
and
looked
back
as
one
might
have
anticipated
there
was
nothing
visible
to
account
for
the
odour
the
emotion
of
fear
is
a
strange
and
complex
one
in
this
breath
of
decay
rising
to
his
nostril
cairn
found
something
fearsome
he
opened
the
door
stepped
out
on
to
the
landing
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
at
an
hour
close
upon
midnight
bruce
cairn
who
was
about
to
retire
received
a
wholly
unexpected
visit
from
his
son
robert
cairn
followed
his
father
into
the
library
and
sat
down
in
the
big
red
leathern
the
doctor
tilted
the
lamp
shade
directing
the
light
upon
robert
face
it
proved
to
be
slightly
pale
and
in
the
clear
eyes
was
an
odd
expression
almost
a
hunted
look
what
the
trouble
rob
have
a
whisky
and
soda
robert
cairn
helped
himself
quietly
now
take
a
cigar
and
tell
me
what
has
frightened
you
frightened
me
he
started
and
paused
in
the
act
of
reaching
for
a
match
yes
you
right
sir
i
frightened
not
at
the
moment
you
have
been
right
again
he
lighted
his
cigar
i
want
to
begin
by
saying
that
well
how
can
i
put
it
when
i
took
up
newspaper
work
we
thought
it
would
be
better
if
i
lived
in
chambers
certainly
well
at
that
time
he
examined
the
lighted
end
of
his
cigar
there
was
no
reason
why
i
should
not
live
alone
but
now
well
now
i
feel
sir
that
i
have
need
of
more
or
less
constant
companionship
especially
i
feel
that
it
would
be
desirable
to
have
a
friend
handy
at
er
at
night
time
cairn
leant
forward
in
his
chair
his
face
was
very
stern
hold
out
your
fingers
he
said
extended
left
hand
his
son
obeyed
smiling
slightly
the
open
hand
showed
in
the
lamplight
steady
as
a
carven
hand
nerves
quite
in
order
sir
cairn
inhaled
a
deep
breath
tell
me
he
said
it
a
queer
tale
his
son
began
and
if
i
told
it
to
craig
fenton
or
madderley
round
in
harley
street
i
know
what
they
would
say
but
you
will
it
started
this
afternoon
when
the
sun
was
pouring
in
through
the
windows
i
had
to
go
to
my
chambers
to
change
and
the
rooms
were
filled
with
a
most
disgusting
smell
his
father
started
what
kind
of
smell
he
asked
not
incense
no
replied
robert
looking
hard
at
him
i
thought
you
would
ask
that
it
was
a
smell
of
something
putrid
something
rotten
rotten
with
the
rottenness
of
ages
did
you
trace
where
it
came
from
i
opened
all
the
windows
and
that
seemed
to
disperse
it
for
a
time
then
just
as
i
was
going
out
it
returned
it
seemed
to
envelop
me
like
a
filthy
miasma
you
know
sir
it
hard
to
explain
just
the
way
i
felt
about
it
but
it
all
amounts
to
this
i
was
glad
to
get
outside
cairn
stood
up
and
began
to
pace
about
the
room
his
hands
locked
behind
him
he
rapped
suddenly
what
occurred
continued
his
son
i
got
in
at
about
nine
i
had
had
such
a
rush
in
one
way
and
another
that
the
incident
had
quite
lost
its
hold
on
my
imagination
i
had
forgotten
it
of
course
but
i
was
not
thinking
of
it
when
i
unlocked
the
door
in
fact
i
did
begin
to
think
of
it
again
until
in
slippers
and
i
had
settled
down
for
a
comfortable
read
there
was
nothing
absolutely
nothing
to
influence
my
imagination
in
that
way
the
book
was
an
old
favourite
mark
twain
the
and
i
sat
in
the
armchair
with
a
large
bottle
of
lager
beer
at
my
elbow
and
my
pipe
going
strong
becoming
restless
in
turn
the
speaker
stood
up
and
walking
to
the
fireplace
flicked
off
the
long
cone
of
grey
ash
from
his
cigar
he
leant
one
elbow
upon
the
resuming
his
story
paul
had
just
chimed
the
ten
when
my
pipe
went
out
before
i
had
time
to
it
came
the
damnable
smell
again
at
the
moment
nothing
was
farther
from
my
mind
and
i
jumped
up
with
an
exclamation
of
disgust
it
seemed
to
be
growing
stronger
and
stronger
i
got
my
pipe
alight
quickly
still
i
could
smell
it
the
aroma
of
the
tobacco
did
not
lessen
its
beastly
pungency
in
the
smallest
degree
i
tilted
the
shade
of
my
and
looked
all
about
there
was
nothing
unusual
to
be
seen
both
windows
were
open
and
i
went
to
one
and
thrust
my
head
out
in
order
to
learn
if
the
odour
came
from
outside
it
did
not
the
air
outside
the
window
was
fresh
and
clean
then
i
remembered
that
when
i
had
left
my
chambers
in
the
afternoon
the
smell
had
been
stronger
near
the
door
than
anywhere
i
ran
out
to
the
door
in
the
passage
i
could
smell
nothing
but
he
paused
glancing
at
his
father
before
i
had
stood
there
thirty
seconds
it
was
rising
all
about
me
like
the
fumes
from
a
crater
by
god
sir
i
realised
then
that
it
was
something
following
me
cairn
stood
watching
him
from
the
shadows
beyond
the
big
table
as
he
came
forward
and
finished
his
whisky
at
a
gulp
that
seemed
to
work
a
change
in
me
he
continued
rapidly
i
recognised
there
was
something
behind
this
disgusting
manifestation
something
directing
it
and
i
recognised
too
that
the
next
move
was
up
to
me
i
went
back
to
my
room
the
odour
was
not
so
pronounced
but
as
i
stood
by
the
table
waiting
it
increased
and
increased
until
it
almost
choked
me
my
nerves
were
playing
tricks
but
i
kept
a
fast
hold
on
myself
i
set
to
work
very
methodically
and
fumigated
the
place
within
myself
i
knew
that
it
could
do
no
good
but
i
felt
that
i
had
to
put
up
some
kind
of
opposition
you
understand
sir
quite
replied
cairn
quietly
it
was
an
organised
attempt
to
expel
the
invader
and
though
of
itself
it
was
useless
the
mental
attitude
dictating
it
was
good
go
on
the
clocks
had
chimed
eleven
when
i
gave
up
and
i
felt
physically
sick
the
air
by
this
time
was
poisonous
literally
poisonous
i
dropped
into
the
and
began
to
wonder
what
the
end
of
it
would
be
then
in
the
shadowy
parts
of
the
room
outside
the
circle
of
light
cast
by
the
lamp
i
detected
darker
patches
for
awhile
i
tried
to
believe
that
they
were
imaginary
but
when
i
saw
one
move
along
the
bookcase
glide
down
its
side
and
come
across
the
carpet
towards
me
i
knew
that
they
were
not
before
heaven
sir
his
voice
shook
either
i
am
mad
or
my
room
was
filled
with
things
that
they
were
everywhere
on
the
floor
on
the
walls
even
on
the
ceiling
above
me
where
the
light
was
i
could
detect
them
but
the
shadows
were
alive
alive
with
things
the
size
of
my
two
hands
and
in
the
growing
stillness
his
voice
had
become
husky
cairn
stood
still
as
a
man
of
stone
watching
him
in
the
stillness
very
faintly
silence
fell
a
car
passed
outside
in
street
its
throb
died
away
a
clock
was
chiming
the
after
midnight
cairn
spoke
anything
else
one
other
thing
sir
i
was
gripping
the
chair
arms
i
felt
that
i
had
to
grip
something
to
prevent
myself
from
slipping
into
madness
my
left
hand
he
glanced
at
it
with
a
sort
of
repugnance
something
hairy
and
indescribably
loathsome
touched
it
just
brushed
against
it
but
it
was
too
much
i
ashamed
to
tell
you
sir
i
screamed
screamed
like
any
hysterical
girl
and
for
the
second
time
ran
i
ran
from
my
own
rooms
grabbed
a
hat
and
coat
and
left
my
dressing
gown
on
the
floor
he
turned
leaning
both
elbows
on
the
and
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
have
another
drink
said
cairn
you
called
on
antony
ferrara
did
you
how
did
he
receive
you
that
brings
me
to
something
else
i
wanted
to
tell
you
continued
robert
squirting
into
his
glass
myra
goes
there
where
to
his
chambers
yes
cairn
began
to
pace
the
room
again
i
am
not
surprised
he
admitted
she
has
always
been
taught
to
regard
him
in
the
light
of
a
brother
but
nevertheless
we
must
put
a
stop
to
it
how
did
you
learn
this
robert
cairn
gave
him
an
account
of
the
morning
incidents
describing
ferrara
chambers
with
a
minute
exactness
which
revealed
how
deep
how
indelible
an
impression
their
strangeness
had
made
upon
his
mind
there
is
one
thing
he
concluded
against
which
i
am
always
coming
up
i
puzzled
over
it
at
oxford
and
others
did
too
i
came
against
it
who
antony
ferrara
where
did
sir
michael
find
him
what
kind
of
woman
bore
such
a
son
stop
boy
cried
cairn
robert
started
looking
at
his
father
across
the
table
you
are
already
in
danger
rob
i
wo
disguise
that
fact
from
you
myra
duquesne
is
no
relation
of
ferrara
therefore
since
she
inherits
half
of
sir
michael
fortune
a
certain
course
must
have
suggested
itself
to
antony
you
patently
are
an
obstacle
bad
enough
boy
let
us
deal
with
it
before
we
look
for
further
trouble
he
took
up
a
blackened
briar
from
the
table
and
began
to
load
it
regarding
your
next
move
he
continued
slowly
there
can
be
no
question
you
must
return
to
your
chambers
what
there
can
be
no
question
rob
a
kind
of
attack
has
been
made
upon
you
which
only
can
repel
if
you
desert
your
chambers
it
will
be
repeated
here
at
present
it
is
evidently
localised
there
are
laws
governing
these
things
laws
as
immutable
as
any
other
laws
in
nature
one
of
them
is
this
the
powers
of
darkness
to
employ
a
conventional
and
significant
phrase
can
not
triumph
over
the
powers
of
will
below
the
godhead
will
is
the
supreme
force
of
the
universe
you
resist
or
you
are
lost
what
do
you
mean
sir
i
mean
that
destruction
of
mind
and
of
something
more
than
mind
threatens
you
if
you
retreat
you
are
lost
go
back
to
your
rooms
your
foe
strive
to
haul
him
into
the
light
and
crush
him
the
phenomena
at
your
rooms
belong
to
one
of
two
varieties
at
present
it
seems
impossible
to
classify
them
more
closely
both
are
dangerous
though
in
different
ways
i
suspect
however
that
a
purely
mental
effort
will
be
sufficient
to
disperse
these
nauseous
probably
you
will
not
be
troubled
again
but
whenever
the
phenomena
return
take
off
your
coat
to
them
you
require
no
better
companion
than
the
one
you
had
mark
twain
treat
your
visitors
as
one
might
imagine
he
would
have
treated
them
as
a
very
poor
joke
but
whenever
it
begins
again
ring
me
up
do
hesitate
whatever
the
hour
i
shall
be
at
the
hospital
all
day
but
from
seven
onward
i
shall
be
here
and
shall
make
a
point
of
remaining
give
me
a
call
when
you
return
now
and
if
there
is
no
earlier
occasion
another
in
the
morning
then
rely
upon
my
active
throughout
the
following
night
active
sir
i
said
active
rob
the
next
repetition
of
these
manifestations
shall
be
the
last
remember
you
have
only
to
lift
the
receiver
to
know
that
you
are
not
alone
in
your
fight
robert
cairn
took
a
second
cigar
lighted
it
finished
his
whisky
and
squared
his
shoulders
sir
he
said
i
sha
run
away
a
third
time
when
the
door
had
closed
upon
his
exit
cairn
resumed
his
restless
pacing
up
and
down
the
library
he
had
given
roman
counsel
for
he
had
sent
his
son
out
to
face
alone
a
real
and
dreadful
danger
only
thus
could
he
hope
to
save
him
but
nevertheless
it
had
been
hard
the
next
fight
would
be
a
fight
to
the
finish
for
robert
had
said
i
run
away
a
third
time
and
he
was
a
man
of
his
word
as
cairn
had
declared
the
manifestations
belonged
to
one
of
two
varieties
according
to
the
most
ancient
science
in
the
world
the
science
by
which
the
egyptians
and
perhaps
even
earlier
peoples
ordered
their
lives
we
share
this
our
plane
of
existence
with
certain
other
creatures
often
called
elementals
mercifully
these
fearsome
entities
are
invisible
to
our
normal
sight
just
as
the
finer
tones
of
music
are
inaudible
to
our
normal
powers
of
hearing
victims
of
delirium
tremens
opium
smokers
and
other
debauchees
artificially
open
that
finer
latent
power
of
vision
and
the
horrors
which
surround
them
are
not
imaginary
but
are
elementals
attracted
to
the
victim
by
his
peculiar
excesses
the
crawling
things
then
which
reeked
abominably
might
be
elementals
so
cairn
reasoned
superimposed
upon
robert
cairn
consciousness
by
a
directing
malignant
intelligence
on
the
other
hand
they
might
be
mere
glamours
or
thrust
upon
him
by
the
same
wizard
mind
emanations
from
an
evil
powerful
will
his
reflections
were
interrupted
by
the
ringing
of
the
bell
he
took
up
the
receiver
hullo
that
you
sir
all
clear
here
now
i
turning
in
right
rob
ring
me
in
the
morning
sir
cairn
refilled
his
charred
briar
and
taking
from
a
drawer
in
the
writing
table
a
thick
sat
down
and
began
to
study
the
pages
the
paper
was
in
the
cramped
handwriting
of
the
late
sir
michael
ferrara
his
travelling
companion
through
many
strange
adventures
and
the
sun
had
been
flooding
the
library
with
dimmed
golden
light
for
several
hours
and
a
bustle
below
stairs
acclaiming
an
awakened
household
ere
the
doctor
studies
were
interrupted
again
it
was
the
bell
he
rose
switched
off
the
and
lifted
the
instrument
that
you
rob
yes
sir
all
well
thank
god
can
i
breakfast
with
you
certainly
my
boy
cairn
glanced
at
his
watch
why
upon
my
soul
it
seven
chapter
vi
the
beetles
sixteen
hours
had
elapsed
and
london
clocks
were
booming
eleven
that
night
when
the
uncanny
drama
entered
upon
its
final
stage
once
more
cairn
sat
alone
with
sir
michael
manuscript
but
at
frequent
intervals
his
glance
would
stray
to
the
telephone
at
his
elbow
he
had
given
orders
to
the
effect
that
he
was
on
no
account
to
be
disturbed
and
that
his
car
should
be
ready
at
the
door
from
ten
onward
as
the
sound
of
the
final
strokes
was
dying
away
the
expected
summons
came
cairn
jaw
squared
and
his
mouth
was
very
grim
when
he
recognised
his
son
voice
over
the
wires
well
boy
they
here
sir
now
while
i
speaking
i
have
been
fighting
fighting
hard
for
half
an
hour
the
place
smells
like
a
and
the
shapes
are
taking
definite
horrible
form
they
have
his
voice
sounded
harsh
quite
black
the
eyes
are
and
they
shine
like
beads
it
gradually
wearing
me
down
although
i
have
myself
in
hand
so
far
i
mean
i
might
crack
up
at
any
moment
bah
his
voice
ceased
hullo
cried
cairn
hullo
rob
it
all
right
sir
came
all
but
inaudibly
the
things
are
all
around
the
edge
of
the
light
patch
they
make
a
sort
of
rustling
noise
it
is
a
tremendous
conscious
to
keep
them
at
bay
while
i
was
speaking
i
somehow
lost
my
grip
of
the
situation
one
crawled
it
fastened
on
my
hand
a
hairy
horror
oh
my
god
another
is
touching
rob
rob
keep
your
nerve
boy
do
you
hear
yes
yes
faintly
my
boy
pray
for
strength
and
it
will
come
to
you
you
hold
out
for
another
ten
minutes
ten
minutes
do
you
understand
yes
yes
merciful
god
if
you
can
help
me
do
it
sir
or
hold
out
boy
in
you
have
won
cairn
hung
up
the
receiver
raced
from
the
library
and
grabbing
a
cap
from
the
rack
in
the
hall
ran
down
the
steps
and
bounded
into
the
waiting
car
shouting
an
address
to
the
man
piccadilly
was
gay
with
theatre
crowds
when
he
leapt
out
and
ran
into
the
which
had
been
the
scene
of
robert
meeting
with
myra
duquesne
cairn
ran
past
the
lift
doors
and
went
up
the
stairs
three
steps
at
a
time
he
pressed
his
finger
to
the
beside
antony
ferrara
door
and
held
it
there
until
the
door
opened
and
a
dusky
face
appeared
in
the
opening
the
visitor
thrust
his
way
in
past
the
man
holding
out
his
arms
to
detain
him
not
at
home
cairn
shot
out
a
sinewy
hand
grabbed
the
man
he
was
a
tall
by
the
shoulder
and
sent
him
spinning
across
the
mosaic
floor
of
the
the
air
was
heavy
with
the
perfume
of
ambergris
wasting
no
word
upon
the
reeling
man
cairn
stepped
to
the
doorway
he
jerked
the
drapery
aside
and
found
himself
in
a
dark
corridor
from
his
son
description
of
the
chambers
he
had
no
difficulty
in
recognising
the
door
of
the
study
he
turned
the
handle
the
door
proved
to
be
unlocked
and
entered
the
darkened
room
in
the
grate
a
huge
fire
glowed
redly
the
temperature
of
the
place
was
almost
unbearable
on
the
table
the
light
from
the
silver
lamp
shed
a
patch
of
radiance
but
the
rest
of
the
study
was
veiled
in
shadow
a
figure
was
seated
in
a
carved
chair
one
corner
of
the
garment
was
thrown
across
the
table
half
rising
the
figure
turned
and
an
evil
apparition
in
the
glow
from
the
fire
antony
ferrara
faced
the
intruder
cairn
walked
forward
until
he
stood
over
the
other
uncover
what
you
have
on
the
table
he
said
succinctly
ferrara
strange
eyes
were
uplifted
to
the
speaker
with
an
expression
in
their
depths
which
in
the
middle
ages
alone
would
have
sent
a
man
to
the
stake
cairn
the
husky
voice
had
lost
something
of
its
suavity
you
heard
my
order
your
surely
doctor
since
i
am
in
my
own
uncover
what
you
have
on
the
table
or
must
i
do
so
for
you
antony
ferrara
placed
his
hand
upon
the
end
of
the
black
robe
which
lay
across
the
table
be
careful
cairn
he
said
evenly
you
are
taking
risks
cairn
suddenly
leapt
seized
the
shielding
hand
in
a
sure
grip
and
twisted
ferrara
arm
behind
him
then
with
a
second
rapid
movement
he
snatched
away
the
robe
a
faint
smell
a
smell
of
corruption
of
ancient
rottenness
arose
on
the
superheated
air
a
square
of
faded
linen
lay
on
the
table
figured
with
all
but
indecipherable
egyptian
characters
and
upon
it
in
rows
which
formed
a
definite
geometrical
design
were
arranged
a
great
number
of
little
black
insects
cairn
released
the
hand
which
he
held
and
ferrara
sat
quite
still
looking
straight
before
him
beetles
from
the
skull
of
a
mummy
you
filthy
obscene
beast
ferrara
spoke
with
a
calm
suddenly
regained
is
there
anything
obscene
in
the
study
of
beetles
my
son
saw
these
things
here
yesterday
and
last
night
and
again
you
cast
magnified
doubles
glamours
of
the
horrible
creatures
into
his
rooms
by
means
which
you
know
of
but
which
know
of
too
you
sought
to
bring
your
down
to
the
material
plane
cairn
my
respect
for
you
is
great
but
i
fear
that
much
study
has
made
you
mad
ferrara
reached
out
his
hand
towards
an
ebony
box
he
was
smiling
do
dare
to
touch
that
box
he
paused
glancing
up
more
orders
doctor
exactly
cairn
grabbed
the
faded
linen
scooping
up
the
beetles
within
it
and
striding
across
the
room
threw
the
whole
unsavoury
bundle
into
the
heart
of
the
fire
a
great
flame
leapt
up
there
came
a
series
of
squeaky
explosions
so
that
almost
one
might
have
imagined
those
insects
to
have
had
life
then
the
doctor
turned
again
ferrara
leapt
to
his
feet
with
a
cry
that
had
in
it
something
inhuman
and
began
rapidly
to
babble
in
a
tongue
that
was
not
european
he
was
facing
cairn
a
tall
sinister
figure
but
one
hand
was
groping
behind
him
for
the
box
stop
that
rapped
the
doctor
imperatively
and
for
the
last
time
do
not
dare
to
touch
that
box
the
flood
of
strange
words
was
dammed
ferrara
stood
quivering
but
silent
the
laws
by
which
such
as
you
were
burnt
the
laws
of
long
ago
are
no
more
said
cairn
english
law
can
not
touch
you
but
god
has
provided
for
your
kind
perhaps
whispered
ferrara
you
would
like
also
to
burn
this
box
to
which
you
object
so
strongly
no
power
on
earth
would
prevail
upon
me
to
touch
it
but
you
you
touched
it
and
you
know
the
penalty
you
raise
forces
of
evil
that
have
lain
dormant
for
ages
and
dare
to
wield
them
beware
i
know
of
some
whom
you
have
murdered
i
can
not
know
how
many
you
have
sent
to
the
madhouse
but
i
swear
that
in
future
your
victims
shall
be
few
there
is
a
way
to
deal
with
you
he
turned
and
walked
to
the
door
beware
also
dear
cairn
came
softly
as
you
say
i
raise
forces
of
evil
cairn
spun
about
in
three
strides
he
was
standing
over
antony
ferrara
fists
clenched
and
his
sinewy
body
tense
in
every
fibre
his
face
was
pale
as
was
apparent
even
in
that
vague
light
and
his
eyes
gleamed
like
steel
you
raise
other
forces
he
said
and
his
voice
though
steady
was
very
low
evil
forces
also
antony
ferrara
invoker
of
nameless
horrors
shrank
before
him
before
the
primitive
celtic
man
whom
unwittingly
he
had
invoked
cairn
was
spare
and
lean
but
in
perfect
physical
condition
now
he
was
strong
with
the
strength
of
a
just
cause
moreover
he
was
dangerous
and
ferrara
knew
it
well
i
fear
began
the
latter
huskily
dare
to
bandy
words
with
me
said
cairn
with
icy
coolness
answer
me
back
but
once
again
and
before
god
i
strike
you
dead
ferrara
sat
silent
clutching
at
the
arms
of
his
chair
and
not
daring
to
raise
his
eyes
for
ten
magnetic
seconds
they
stayed
so
then
again
cairn
turned
and
this
time
walked
out
the
clocks
had
been
chiming
the
quarter
after
eleven
as
he
had
entered
antony
ferrara
chambers
and
some
had
not
finished
their
chimes
when
his
son
choking
calling
wildly
upon
heaven
to
aid
him
had
fallen
in
the
midst
of
crowding
obscene
things
and
in
the
instant
of
his
fall
had
found
the
room
clear
of
the
waving
antenn√¶
the
beady
eyes
and
the
beetle
shapes
the
whole
horrible
phantasmagoria
together
with
the
odour
of
ancient
rottenness
faded
like
a
fevered
dream
at
the
moment
that
cairn
had
burst
in
upon
the
creator
of
it
robert
cairn
stood
up
weakly
trembling
then
dropped
upon
his
knees
and
sobbed
out
prayers
of
thankfulness
that
came
from
his
frightened
soul
chapter
vii
sir
elwin
groves
patient
when
a
substantial
legacy
is
divided
into
two
shares
one
of
which
falls
to
a
man
young
dissolute
and
clever
and
the
other
to
a
girl
pretty
and
inexperienced
there
is
laughter
in
the
hells
but
to
the
girl
legacy
add
another
item
a
strong
stern
guardian
and
the
issue
becomes
one
less
easy
to
predict
in
the
case
at
present
under
consideration
such
an
arrangement
led
bruce
cairn
to
pack
off
myra
duquesne
to
a
grim
scottish
manor
in
inverness
upon
a
visit
of
indefinite
duration
it
also
led
to
heart
burnings
on
the
part
of
robert
cairn
and
to
other
things
about
to
be
noticed
antony
ferrara
the
was
not
slow
to
recognise
that
a
damaging
stroke
had
been
played
but
he
knew
cairn
too
well
to
put
up
any
protest
in
his
capacity
of
fashionable
physician
the
doctor
frequently
met
ferrara
in
society
for
a
man
at
once
rich
handsome
and
bearing
a
fine
name
is
not
socially
ostracised
on
the
mere
suspicion
that
he
is
a
dangerous
blackguard
thus
antony
ferrara
was
courted
by
the
smartest
women
in
town
and
tolerated
by
the
men
cairn
would
always
acknowledge
him
and
then
turn
his
back
upon
the
adopted
son
of
his
dearest
friend
there
was
that
between
the
two
of
which
the
world
knew
nothing
had
the
world
known
what
cairn
knew
respecting
antony
ferrara
then
despite
his
winning
manner
his
wealth
and
his
station
every
door
in
london
from
those
of
mayfair
to
that
of
the
foulest
den
in
limehouse
would
have
been
closed
to
him
closed
and
barred
with
horror
and
loathing
a
tremendous
secret
was
locked
up
within
the
heart
of
bruce
cairn
sometimes
we
seem
to
be
granted
a
glimpse
of
the
guiding
hand
that
steers
men
destinies
then
as
comprehension
is
about
to
dawn
we
lose
again
our
temporal
lucidity
of
vision
the
following
incident
illustrates
this
sir
elwin
groves
of
harley
street
took
cairn
aside
at
the
club
one
evening
i
am
passing
a
patient
on
to
you
cairn
he
said
lord
lashmore
ah
replied
cairn
thoughtfully
i
have
never
met
him
he
has
only
quite
recently
returned
to
england
you
may
have
heard
and
brought
a
south
american
lady
lashmore
with
him
i
had
heard
that
yes
lord
lashmore
is
close
upon
and
his
wife
a
passionate
southern
type
is
probably
less
than
twenty
they
are
an
odd
couple
the
lady
has
been
doing
some
extensive
entertaining
at
the
town
house
groves
stared
hard
at
cairn
your
young
friend
antony
ferrara
is
a
regular
visitor
no
doubt
said
cairn
he
goes
everywhere
i
do
know
how
long
his
funds
will
last
i
have
wondered
too
his
chambers
are
like
a
scene
from
the
nights
how
do
you
know
inquired
the
other
curiously
have
you
attended
him
yes
was
the
reply
his
eastern
servant
for
me
one
night
last
week
and
i
found
ferrara
lying
unconscious
in
a
room
like
a
pasha
harem
he
looked
simply
ghastly
but
the
man
would
give
me
no
account
of
what
had
caused
the
attack
it
looked
to
me
like
sheer
nervous
exhaustion
he
gave
me
quite
an
anxious
five
minutes
incidentally
the
room
was
blazing
hot
with
a
fire
roaring
right
up
the
chimney
and
it
smelt
like
a
hindu
temple
ah
muttered
cairn
between
his
mode
of
life
and
his
peculiar
studies
he
will
probably
crack
up
he
has
a
fragile
constitution
who
the
deuce
is
he
cairn
pursued
sir
elwin
you
must
know
all
the
circumstances
of
his
adoption
you
were
with
the
late
sir
michael
in
egypt
at
the
time
the
fellow
is
a
mystery
to
me
he
repels
in
some
way
i
was
glad
to
get
away
from
his
rooms
you
were
going
to
tell
me
something
about
lord
lashmore
case
i
think
said
cairn
sir
elwin
groves
screwed
up
his
eyes
and
readjusted
his
for
the
deliberate
way
in
which
his
companion
had
changed
the
conversation
was
unmistakable
however
cairn
brusque
manners
were
proverbial
and
sir
elwin
accepted
the
lead
yes
yes
i
believe
i
was
he
agreed
rather
lamely
well
very
singular
i
was
called
there
last
monday
at
about
two
in
the
morning
i
found
the
house
and
lady
lashmore
with
a
thrown
over
her
nightdress
engaged
in
bathing
a
bad
wound
in
her
husband
throat
what
attempted
suicide
my
first
idea
naturally
but
a
glance
at
the
wound
set
me
wondering
it
was
bleeding
profusely
and
from
its
location
i
was
afraid
that
it
might
have
penetrated
the
internal
jugular
but
the
external
only
was
wounded
i
arrested
the
flow
of
blood
and
made
the
patient
comfortable
lady
lashmore
assisted
me
coolly
and
displayed
some
skill
as
a
nurse
in
fact
she
had
applied
a
ligature
before
my
arrival
lord
lashmore
remained
conscious
quite
he
was
shaky
of
course
i
called
again
at
nine
that
morning
and
found
him
progressing
favourably
when
i
had
dressed
the
wounds
wounds
there
were
two
actually
i
will
tell
you
in
a
moment
i
asked
lord
lashmore
for
an
explanation
he
had
given
out
for
the
benefit
of
the
household
that
stumbling
out
of
bed
in
the
dark
he
had
tripped
upon
a
rug
so
that
he
fell
forward
almost
into
the
fireplace
there
is
a
rather
ornate
fender
with
an
elaborate
copper
scrollwork
design
and
his
account
was
that
he
came
down
with
all
his
weight
upon
this
in
such
a
way
that
part
of
the
copperwork
pierced
his
throat
it
was
possible
just
possible
cairn
but
it
did
satisfy
me
and
i
could
see
that
it
did
satisfy
lady
lashmore
however
when
we
were
alone
lashmore
told
me
the
real
facts
he
had
been
concealing
the
truth
largely
for
his
wife
sake
i
fancy
he
was
anxious
to
spare
her
the
alarm
which
knowing
the
truth
she
must
have
experienced
his
story
was
this
related
in
confidence
but
he
wishes
that
you
should
know
he
was
awakened
by
a
sudden
sharp
pain
in
the
throat
not
very
acute
but
accompanied
by
a
feeling
of
pressure
it
was
gone
again
in
a
moment
and
he
was
surprised
to
find
blood
upon
his
hands
when
he
felt
for
the
cause
of
the
pain
he
got
out
of
bed
and
experienced
a
great
dizziness
the
hemorrhage
was
altogether
more
severe
than
he
had
supposed
not
wishing
to
arouse
his
wife
he
did
not
enter
his
which
is
situated
between
his
own
room
and
lady
lashmore
he
staggered
as
far
as
the
and
then
collapsed
his
man
found
him
on
the
floor
sufficiently
near
to
the
fender
to
lend
colour
to
the
story
of
the
accident
cairn
coughed
drily
do
you
think
it
was
attempted
suicide
after
all
then
he
asked
no
i
do
replied
sir
elwin
emphatically
i
think
it
was
something
altogether
more
difficult
to
explain
not
attempted
murder
almost
impossible
excepting
chambers
lord
lashmore
valet
no
one
could
possibly
have
gained
access
to
that
suite
of
rooms
they
number
four
there
is
a
small
boudoir
out
of
which
opens
lady
bedroom
between
this
and
lord
lashmore
apartment
is
the
lord
lashmore
door
was
locked
and
so
was
that
of
the
boudoir
these
are
the
only
two
means
of
entrance
but
you
said
that
chambers
came
in
and
found
him
chambers
has
a
key
of
lord
lashmore
door
that
is
why
i
said
chambers
but
chambers
has
been
with
his
present
master
since
lashmore
left
cambridge
it
out
of
the
question
windows
first
floor
no
balcony
and
overlook
hyde
park
is
there
no
clue
to
the
mystery
there
are
three
what
are
they
first
the
nature
of
the
wounds
second
lord
lashmore
idea
that
something
was
in
the
room
at
the
moment
of
his
awakening
third
the
fact
that
an
identical
attempt
was
made
upon
him
last
night
last
night
good
god
with
what
result
the
former
wounds
though
deep
are
very
tiny
and
had
quite
healed
over
one
of
them
partially
reopened
but
lord
lashmore
awoke
altogether
more
readily
and
before
any
damage
had
been
done
he
says
that
some
soft
body
rolled
off
the
bed
he
uttered
a
loud
cry
leapt
out
and
switched
on
the
electric
lights
at
the
same
moment
he
heard
a
frightful
scream
from
his
wife
room
when
i
arrived
lashmore
himself
summoned
me
on
this
occasion
i
had
a
new
patient
lady
lashmore
exactly
she
had
fainted
from
fright
at
hearing
her
husband
cry
i
assume
there
had
been
a
slight
hemorrhage
from
the
throat
too
what
tuberculous
i
fear
so
fright
would
not
produce
hemorrhage
in
the
case
of
a
healthy
subject
would
it
cairn
shook
his
head
he
was
obviously
perplexed
and
lord
lashmore
he
asked
the
marks
were
there
again
replied
sir
elwin
rather
lower
on
the
neck
but
they
were
quite
superficial
he
had
awakened
in
time
and
had
struck
out
hitting
something
what
some
living
thing
apparently
covered
with
long
silky
hair
it
escaped
however
and
now
said
cairn
these
wounds
what
are
they
like
they
are
like
the
marks
of
fangs

chapter
viii
the
secret
of
dhoon
lord
lashmore
was
a
big
blonde
man
fresh
coloured
and
having
his
nearly
white
hair
worn
close
cut
and
his
moustache
trimmed
in
the
neat
military
fashion
for
a
fair
man
he
had
eyes
of
a
singular
colour
they
were
of
so
dark
a
shade
of
brown
as
to
appear
black
southern
eyes
lending
to
his
personality
an
oddness
very
striking
when
he
was
shown
into
cairn
library
the
doctor
regarded
him
with
that
searching
scrutiny
peculiar
to
men
of
his
profession
at
the
same
time
inviting
the
visitor
to
be
seated
lashmore
sat
down
in
the
red
leathern
armchair
resting
his
large
hands
upon
his
knees
with
the
fingers
widely
spread
he
had
a
massive
dignity
but
was
not
entirely
at
his
ease
cairn
opened
the
conversation
in
his
direct
fashion
you
come
to
consult
me
lord
lashmore
in
my
capacity
of
occultist
rather
than
in
that
of
physician
in
both
replied
lord
lashmore
distinctly
in
both
sir
elwin
groves
is
attending
you
for
certain
throat
wounds
lord
lashmore
touched
the
high
stock
which
he
was
wearing
the
scars
remain
he
said
do
you
wish
to
see
them
i
am
afraid
i
must
trouble
you
the
stock
was
untied
and
cairn
through
a
powerful
glass
examined
the
marks
one
of
them
the
lower
was
slightly
inflamed
lord
lashmore
retied
his
stock
standing
before
the
small
mirror
set
in
the
overmantel
you
had
an
impression
of
some
presence
in
the
room
at
the
time
of
the
outrage
pursued
the
doctor
distinctly
on
both
occasions
did
you
see
anything
the
room
was
too
dark
but
you
felt
something
hair
my
knuckles
as
i
struck
out
i
am
speaking
of
the
second
outrage
encountered
a
thick
mass
of
hair
the
body
of
some
animal
probably
the
head
but
still
you
saw
nothing
i
must
confess
that
i
had
a
vague
idea
of
some
shape
flitting
away
across
the
room
a
white
shape
therefore
probably
a
figment
of
my
imagination
your
cry
awakened
lady
lashmore
unfortunately
yes
her
nerves
were
badly
shaken
already
and
this
second
shock
proved
too
severe
sir
elwin
fears
chest
trouble
i
am
taking
her
abroad
as
soon
as
possible
she
was
found
insensible
where
at
the
door
of
the
the
door
communicating
with
her
own
room
not
that
communicating
with
mine
she
had
evidently
started
to
come
to
my
assistance
when
faintness
overcame
her
what
is
her
own
account
that
is
her
own
account
who
discovered
her
i
did
cairn
was
drumming
his
fingers
on
the
table
you
have
a
theory
lord
lashmore
he
said
suddenly
let
me
hear
it
lord
lashmore
started
and
glared
across
at
the
speaker
with
a
sort
of
haughty
surprise
have
a
theory
i
think
so
am
i
wrong
lashmore
stood
on
the
rug
before
the
fireplace
with
his
hands
locked
behind
him
and
his
head
lowered
looking
out
under
his
tufted
eyebrows
at
cairn
thus
seen
lord
lashmore
strange
eyes
had
a
sinister
appearance
if
i
had
had
a
theory
he
began
you
would
have
come
to
me
to
seek
confirmation
suggested
cairn
ah
yes
you
may
be
right
sir
elwin
groves
to
whom
i
hinted
something
mentioned
your
name
i
am
not
quite
clear
upon
one
point
cairn
did
he
send
me
to
you
because
he
thought
in
a
word
are
you
a
mental
specialist
i
am
not
sir
elwin
has
no
doubts
respecting
your
brain
lord
lashmore
he
has
sent
you
here
because
i
have
made
some
study
of
what
i
may
term
psychical
ailments
there
is
a
chapter
in
your
family
history
he
fixed
his
searching
gaze
upon
the
other
face
which
latterly
has
been
occupying
your
mind
at
that
lashmore
started
in
good
earnest
to
what
do
you
refer
lord
lashmore
you
have
come
to
me
for
advice
a
rare
ailment
happily
very
rare
in
england
has
assailed
you
circumstances
have
been
in
your
favour
thus
far
but
a
recurrence
is
to
be
anticipated
at
any
time
be
good
enough
to
look
upon
me
as
a
specialist
and
give
me
all
your
confidence
lashmore
cleared
his
throat
what
do
you
wish
to
know
dr
cairn
he
asked
with
a
queer
intermingling
of
respect
and
hauteur
in
his
tones
i
wish
to
know
about
mirza
wife
of
the
third
baron
lashmore
lord
lashmore
took
a
stride
forward
his
large
hands
clenched
and
his
eyes
were
blazing
what
do
you
know
about
her
surprise
was
in
his
voice
and
anger
i
have
seen
her
portrait
in
dhoon
castle
you
were
not
in
residence
at
the
time
mirza
lady
lashmore
was
evidently
a
very
beautiful
woman
what
was
the
date
of
the
marriage
the
third
baron
brought
her
to
england
from
poland
she
was
a
pole
a
polish
jewess
there
was
no
issue
of
the
marriage
but
the
baron
outlived
her
and
married
again
lord
lashmore
shifted
his
feet
nervously
and
gnawed
his
there
issue
of
the
marriage
he
snapped
she
was
my
ancestress
ah
cairn
grey
eyes
lighted
up
momentarily
we
get
to
the
facts
why
was
this
birth
kept
secret
dhoon
castle
has
kept
many
secrets
it
was
a
grim
noble
of
the
middle
ages
who
was
speaking
for
a
lashmore
there
was
no
difficulty
in
suppressing
the
facts
arranging
a
hasty
second
marriage
and
representing
the
boy
as
the
child
of
the
later
union
had
the
second
marriage
proved
fruitful
this
had
been
unnecessary
but
an
heir
to
dhoon
was
essential
i
see
had
the
second
marriage
proved
fruitful
the
child
of
mirza
would
have
been
what
shall
we
say
smothered
damn
it
what
do
you
mean
he
was
the
rightful
heir
cairn
said
lashmore
slowly
you
are
probing
an
open
wound
the
fourth
baron
lashmore
represents
what
the
world
calls
curse
of
the
house
of
dhoon
at
dhoon
castle
there
is
a
secret
chamber
which
has
engaged
the
pens
of
many
occultists
but
which
no
man
save
every
heir
has
entered
for
generations
it
very
location
is
a
secret
measurements
do
not
avail
to
find
it
you
would
appear
to
know
much
of
my
family
black
secret
perhaps
you
know
where
that
room
lies
at
dhoon
certainly
i
do
replied
cairn
calmly
it
is
under
the
moat
some
thirty
yards
west
of
the
former
drawbridge
lord
lashmore
changed
colour
when
he
spoke
again
his
voice
had
lost
its
perhaps
you
know
what
it
contains
i
do
it
contains
paul
fourth
baron
lashmore
son
of
mirza
the
polish
jewess
lord
lashmore
reseated
himself
in
the
big
armchair
staring
at
the
speaker
aghast
i
thought
no
other
in
the
world
knew
that
he
said
hollowly
your
studies
have
been
extensive
indeed
for
three
years
three
whole
years
from
the
night
of
my
birthday
the
horror
hung
over
me
cairn
it
ultimately
brought
my
grandfather
to
the
madhouse
but
my
father
was
of
sterner
stuff
and
so
it
seems
was
i
after
those
three
years
of
horror
i
threw
off
the
memories
of
paul
dhoon
the
third
baron
it
was
on
the
night
of
your
birthday
that
you
were
admitted
to
the
subterranean
room
you
know
so
much
cairn
that
you
may
as
well
know
all
lashmore
face
was
twitching
but
you
are
about
to
hear
what
no
man
has
ever
heard
from
the
lips
of
one
of
my
family
before
he
stood
up
again
restlessly
nearly
years
have
elapsed
he
resumed
since
that
december
night
but
my
very
soul
trembles
now
when
i
recall
it
there
was
a
big
at
dhoon
but
i
had
been
prepared
for
some
weeks
by
my
father
for
the
ordeal
that
awaited
me
our
family
mystery
is
historical
and
there
were
many
fearful
glances
bestowed
upon
me
when
at
midnight
my
father
took
me
aside
from
the
company
and
led
me
to
the
old
library
by
god
cairn
fearful
as
these
reminiscences
are
it
is
a
relief
to
relate
them
to
a
sort
of
suppressed
excitement
was
upon
lashmore
but
his
voice
remained
low
and
hollow
he
asked
me
he
continued
the
traditional
question
if
i
had
prayed
for
strength
god
knows
i
had
then
his
stern
face
very
pale
he
locked
the
library
door
and
from
a
closet
concealed
beside
the
ancient
fireplace
a
closet
which
hitherto
i
had
not
known
to
exist
he
took
out
a
bulky
key
of
antique
workmanship
together
we
set
to
work
to
remove
all
the
volumes
from
one
of
the
bookshelves
even
when
the
shelves
were
empty
it
called
for
our
united
efforts
to
move
the
heavy
piece
of
furniture
but
we
accomplished
the
task
ultimately
making
visible
a
considerable
expanse
of
panelling
nearly
forty
years
had
elapsed
since
that
case
had
been
removed
and
the
carvings
which
it
concealed
were
coated
with
all
the
dust
which
had
accumulated
there
since
the
night
of
my
father
coming
of
age
a
device
upon
the
top
of
the
centre
panel
represented
the
arms
of
the
family
the
helm
which
formed
part
of
the
device
projected
like
a
knob
my
father
grasped
it
turned
it
and
threw
his
weight
against
the
seemingly
solid
wall
it
yielded
swinging
inward
upon
concealed
hinges
and
a
damp
earthy
smell
came
out
into
the
library
taking
up
a
lamp
which
he
had
in
readiness
my
father
entered
the
cavity
beckoning
me
to
follow
i
found
myself
descending
a
flight
of
rough
steps
and
the
roof
above
me
was
so
low
that
i
was
compelled
to
stoop
a
corner
was
come
to
passed
and
a
further
flight
of
steps
appeared
beneath
at
that
time
the
old
moat
was
still
flooded
and
even
had
i
not
divined
as
much
from
the
direction
of
the
steps
i
should
have
known
at
this
point
that
we
were
beneath
it
between
the
stone
blocks
roofing
us
in
oozed
drops
of
moisture
and
the
air
was
at
once
damp
and
icily
cold
a
short
passage
commencing
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
terminated
before
a
massive
door
my
father
placed
the
key
in
the
lock
and
holding
the
lamp
above
his
head
turned
and
looked
at
me
he
was
deathly
pale
all
your
fortitude
he
said
he
strove
to
turn
the
key
but
for
a
long
time
without
success
for
the
lock
was
rusty
finally
however
he
was
a
strong
man
his
efforts
were
successful
the
door
opened
and
an
indescribable
smell
came
out
into
the
passage
never
before
had
i
met
with
anything
like
it
i
have
never
met
with
it
since
lord
lashmore
wiped
his
brow
with
his
handkerchief
the
first
thing
he
resumed
upon
which
the
lamplight
shone
was
what
appeared
to
be
a
spreading
almost
entirely
over
one
wall
of
the
cell
which
i
perceived
before
me
i
have
learnt
since
that
this
was
a
species
of
fungus
not
altogether
uncommon
but
at
the
time
and
in
that
situation
it
shocked
me
inexpressibly
but
let
me
hasten
to
that
which
we
were
come
to
see
let
me
finish
my
story
as
quickly
as
may
be
my
father
halted
at
the
entrance
to
this
frightful
cell
his
hand
with
which
he
held
the
lamp
above
his
head
was
not
steady
and
over
his
shoulder
i
looked
into
the
place
and
saw
cairn
for
three
years
night
and
day
that
spectacle
haunted
me
for
three
years
night
and
day
i
seemed
to
have
before
my
eyes
the
dreadful
face
the
bearded
grinning
face
of
paul
dhoon
he
lay
there
upon
the
floor
of
the
dungeon
his
fists
clenched
and
his
knees
drawn
up
as
if
in
agony
he
had
lain
there
for
generations
yet
as
god
is
my
witness
there
was
flesh
on
his
bones
yellow
and
seared
it
was
and
his
joints
protruded
through
it
but
his
features
were
yet
recognisable
horribly
dreadfully
recognisable
his
black
hair
was
like
a
mane
long
and
matted
his
eyebrows
were
incredibly
heavy
and
his
lashes
overhung
his
cheekbones
the
nails
of
his
fingers
no
i
will
spare
you
but
his
teeth
his
ivory
gleaming
teeth
with
the
two
fully
revealed
by
that
an
aspen
stake
was
driven
through
his
breast
pinning
him
to
the
earthern
floor
and
there
he
lay
in
the
agonised
attitude
of
one
who
had
died
by
such
awful
means
yet
that
stake
was
not
driven
through
his
unhallowed
body
until
a
whole
year
after
his
death
how
i
regained
the
library
i
do
not
remember
i
was
unable
to
rejoin
the
guests
unable
to
face
my
for
days
afterwards
cairn
for
three
years
i
feared
feared
the
world
feared
sleep
feared
myself
above
all
for
i
knew
that
i
had
in
my
veins
the
blood
of
a
chapter
ix
the
polish
jewess
there
was
a
silence
of
some
minutes
duration
lord
lashmore
sat
staring
straight
before
him
his
fists
clenched
upon
his
knees
then
it
was
after
death
that
the
third
baron
developed
certain
qualities
inquired
cairn
there
were
six
cases
of
death
in
the
district
within
twelve
months
replied
lashmore
the
gruesome
cry
of
ran
through
the
community
the
fourth
baron
son
of
paul
dhoon
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
these
reports
until
the
mother
of
a
child
a
child
who
had
died
traced
a
man
or
the
semblance
of
a
man
to
the
gate
of
the
dhoon
family
vault
by
night
secretly
the
son
of
paul
dhoon
visited
the
vault
and
found
the
body
which
despite
twelve
months
in
the
tomb
looked
as
it
had
looked
in
life
was
carried
to
the
dungeon
in
the
middle
ages
a
no
cry
uttered
there
can
reach
the
outer
world
and
was
submitted
to
the
ancient
process
for
slaying
a
vampire
from
that
hour
no
supernatural
visitant
has
troubled
the
district
but
but
said
cairn
quietly
the
strain
came
from
mirza
the
sorceress
what
of
her
lord
lashmore
eyes
shone
feverishly
how
do
you
know
that
she
was
a
sorceress
he
asked
hoarsely
these
are
family
secrets
they
will
remain
so
cairn
answered
but
my
studies
have
gone
far
and
i
know
that
mirza
wife
of
the
third
baron
lashmore
practised
the
black
art
in
life
and
became
after
death
a
ghoul
her
husband
surprised
her
in
certain
detestable
magical
operations
and
struck
her
head
off
he
had
suspected
her
for
some
considerable
time
and
had
not
only
kept
secret
the
birth
of
her
son
but
had
secluded
the
child
from
the
mother
no
heir
resulting
from
his
second
marriage
however
the
son
of
mirza
became
baron
lashmore
and
after
death
became
what
his
mother
had
been
before
him
lord
lashmore
the
curse
of
the
house
of
dhoon
will
prevail
until
the
polish
jewess
who
originated
it
has
been
treated
as
her
son
was
treated
cairn
it
is
not
known
where
her
husband
had
her
body
concealed
he
died
without
revealing
the
secret
do
you
mean
that
the
taint
the
devil
taint
may
recur
oh
my
god
do
you
want
to
drive
me
mad
i
do
not
mean
that
after
so
many
generations
which
have
been
free
from
it
the
vampirism
will
arise
again
in
your
blood
but
i
mean
that
the
spirit
the
unclean
awful
spirit
of
that
vampire
woman
is
still
the
son
was
freed
and
with
him
went
the
hereditary
taint
it
seems
but
the
mother
was
freed
her
body
was
decapitated
but
her
vampire
soul
can
not
go
upon
its
appointed
course
until
the
ancient
ceremonial
has
been
performed
lord
lashmore
passed
his
hand
across
his
eyes
you
daze
me
cairn
in
brief
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
the
spirit
of
mirza
is
to
this
day
loose
upon
the
world
and
is
forced
by
a
deathless
unnatural
longing
to
seek
incarnation
in
a
human
body
it
is
such
awful
pariahs
as
this
lord
lashmore
that
constitute
the
danger
of
spiritualism
given
suitable
conditions
such
a
spirit
might
gain
control
of
a
human
being
do
you
suggest
that
the
spirit
of
the
second
lady
it
is
distinctly
possible
that
she
haunts
her
descendants
i
seem
to
remember
a
tradition
of
dhoon
castle
to
the
effect
that
births
and
deaths
are
heralded
by
a
woman
mocking
laughter
i
myself
heard
it
on
the
night
i
became
lord
lashmore
that
is
the
spirit
who
was
known
in
life
as
mirza
lady
lashmore
but
it
is
possible
to
gain
control
of
such
a
being
by
what
means
by
unhallowed
means
yet
there
are
those
who
do
not
hesitate
to
employ
them
the
danger
of
such
an
operation
is
of
course
enormous
i
perceive
cairn
that
a
theory
covering
the
facts
of
my
recent
experiences
is
forming
in
your
mind
that
is
so
in
order
that
i
may
obtain
corroborative
evidence
i
should
like
to
call
at
your
place
this
evening
suppose
i
come
ostensibly
to
see
lady
lashmore
lord
lashmore
was
watching
the
speaker
there
is
someone
in
my
household
whose
suspicions
you
do
not
wish
to
arouse
he
suggested
there
is
shall
we
make
it
nine
why
not
come
to
dinner
thanks
all
the
same
but
i
think
it
would
serve
my
purpose
better
if
i
came
later
cairn
and
his
son
dined
alone
together
in
street
that
night
i
saw
antony
ferrara
in
regent
street
said
robert
cairn
i
was
glad
to
see
him
cairn
raised
his
heavy
brows
why
he
asked
well
i
was
half
afraid
that
he
might
have
left
london
paid
a
visit
to
myra
duquesne
in
inverness
it
would
not
have
surprised
me
nor
would
it
have
surprised
me
rob
but
i
think
he
is
stalking
other
game
at
present
robert
cairn
looked
up
quickly
lady
lashmore
he
began
well
prompted
his
father
one
of
the
paul
pry
brigade
who
fatten
on
scandal
sent
a
veiled
paragraph
in
to
us
at
yesterday
linking
ferrara
name
with
lady
lashmores
of
course
we
did
use
it
he
had
come
to
the
wrong
market
but
ferrara
was
with
lady
lashmore
when
i
met
him
what
of
that
it
is
not
necessarily
significant
of
course
lord
lashmore
in
all
probability
will
outlive
ferrara
who
looked
even
more
pallid
than
usual
you
regard
him
as
an
utterly
unscrupulous
certainly
did
lady
lashmore
appear
to
be
in
good
health
perfectly
ah
a
silence
fell
of
some
considerable
duration
then
antony
ferrara
is
a
menace
to
society
said
robert
cairn
when
i
meet
the
reptilian
glance
of
those
black
eyes
of
his
and
reflect
upon
what
the
man
has
attempted
what
he
has
done
my
blood
boils
it
is
tragically
funny
to
think
that
in
our
new
wisdom
we
have
abolished
the
only
laws
that
could
have
touched
him
he
could
not
have
existed
in
ancient
chaldea
and
would
probably
have
been
burnt
at
the
stake
even
under
charles
ii
but
in
this
wise
twentieth
century
he
dallies
in
regent
street
with
a
prominent
society
beauty
and
laughs
in
the
face
of
a
man
whom
he
has
attempted
to
destroy
be
very
wary
warned
cairn
remember
that
if
you
died
mysteriously
ferrara
would
be
legally
immune
we
must
wait
and
watch
can
you
return
here
at
about
ten
i
think
i
can
manage
to
do
so
yes
i
shall
expect
you
have
you
brought
up
to
date
your
record
of
those
events
which
we
know
of
together
with
my
notes
and
explanations
yes
sir
i
spent
last
evening
upon
the
notes
there
may
be
something
to
add
this
record
rob
one
day
will
be
a
weapon
to
destroy
an
unnatural
enemy
i
will
sign
two
copies
and
lodge
one
at
my
bank
chapter
x
the
laughter
lady
lashmore
proved
to
be
far
more
beautiful
than
cairn
had
anticipated
she
was
a
true
brunette
with
a
superb
figure
and
eyes
like
the
darkest
passion
flowers
her
creamy
skin
had
a
golden
quality
as
though
it
had
absorbed
within
its
velvet
texture
something
of
the
sunshine
of
the
south
she
greeted
cairn
without
cordiality
i
am
delighted
to
find
you
looking
so
well
lady
lashmore
said
the
doctor
your
appearance
quite
confirms
my
opinion
your
opinion
of
what
dr
cairn
of
the
nature
of
your
recent
seizure
sir
elwin
groves
invited
my
opinion
and
i
gave
it
lady
lashmore
paled
perceptibly
lord
lashmore
i
know
she
said
was
greatly
concerned
but
indeed
it
was
nothing
serious
i
quite
agree
it
was
due
to
nervous
excitement
lady
lashmore
held
a
fan
before
her
face
there
have
been
recent
happenings
she
said
as
no
doubt
you
are
aware
which
must
have
shaken
anyone
nerves
of
course
i
am
familiar
with
your
reputation
cairn
as
a
psychical
specialist
pardon
me
but
from
whom
have
you
learnt
of
it
from
ferrara
she
answered
simply
he
has
assured
me
that
you
are
the
greatest
living
authority
upon
such
matters
cairn
turned
his
head
aside
ah
he
said
grimly
and
i
want
to
ask
you
a
question
continued
lady
lashmore
have
you
any
idea
any
idea
at
all
respecting
the
cause
of
the
wounds
upon
my
husband
throat
do
you
think
them
due
to
something
supernatural
her
voice
shook
and
her
slight
foreign
accent
became
more
marked
nothing
is
supernatural
replied
cairn
but
i
think
they
are
due
to
something
supernormal
i
would
suggest
that
possibly
you
have
suffered
from
evil
dreams
recently
lady
lashmore
started
wildly
and
her
eyes
opened
with
a
sort
of
sudden
horror
how
can
you
know
she
whispered
how
can
you
know
oh
dr
cairn
she
laid
her
hand
upon
his
arm
if
you
can
prevent
those
dreams
if
you
can
assure
me
that
i
shall
never
dream
them
again
it
was
a
plea
and
a
confession
this
was
what
had
lain
behind
her
coldness
this
horror
which
she
had
not
dared
to
confide
in
another
tell
me
he
said
gently
you
have
dreamt
these
dreams
twice
she
nodded
with
wonder
for
his
knowledge
on
the
occasions
of
your
husband
illnesses
yes
yes
what
did
you
dream
oh
can
i
dare
i
tell
you
you
must
there
was
pity
in
his
voice
i
dreamt
that
i
lay
in
some
very
dark
cavern
i
could
hear
the
sea
booming
apparently
over
my
head
but
above
all
the
noise
a
voice
was
audible
calling
to
me
not
by
name
i
can
not
explain
in
what
way
but
calling
calling
imperatively
i
seemed
to
be
clothed
but
scantily
in
some
kind
of
ragged
garments
and
upon
my
knees
i
crawled
toward
the
voice
through
a
place
where
there
were
other
living
things
that
crawled
also
things
with
many
legs
and
clammy
bodies
she
shuddered
and
choked
down
an
hysterical
sob
that
was
half
a
laugh
my
hair
hung
dishevelled
about
me
and
in
some
inexplicable
way
oh
am
i
going
mad
my
head
seemed
to
be
detached
from
my
living
body
i
was
filled
with
a
kind
of
unholy
anger
which
i
can
not
describe
also
i
was
consumed
with
thirst
and
this
thirst
i
think
i
understand
said
cairn
quietly
what
followed
an
interval
quite
blank
after
which
i
dreamt
again
cairn
i
tell
you
of
the
dreadful
the
blasphemous
and
foul
thoughts
that
then
possessed
me
i
found
myself
resisting
resisting
something
some
power
that
was
dragging
me
back
to
that
foul
cavern
with
my
thirst
unslaked
i
was
frenzied
i
dare
not
name
i
tremble
to
think
of
the
ideas
which
filled
my
mind
then
again
came
a
blank
and
i
awoke
she
sat
trembling
cairn
noted
that
she
avoided
his
gaze
you
awoke
he
said
on
the
first
occasion
to
find
that
your
husband
had
met
with
a
strange
and
dangerous
accident
there
was
something
else
lady
lashmore
voice
had
become
a
tremulous
whisper
tell
me
do
be
afraid
she
looked
up
her
magnificent
eyes
were
wild
with
horror
i
believe
you
know
she
breathed
do
you
cairn
nodded
and
on
the
second
occasion
he
said
you
awoke
earlier
lady
lashmore
slightly
moved
her
head
the
dream
was
identical
yes
excepting
these
two
occasions
you
never
dreamt
it
before
i
dreamt
of
it
on
several
other
occasions
or
only
remembered
part
of
it
on
waking
which
part
the
first
that
awful
cavern
and
now
lady
lashmore
you
have
recently
been
present
at
a
spiritualistic
she
was
past
wondering
at
his
power
of
inductive
reasoning
and
merely
nodded
i
suggest
i
do
not
know
that
the
was
held
under
the
auspices
of
antony
ferrara
ostensibly
for
amusement
another
affirmative
nod
answered
him
you
proved
to
be
mediumistic
it
was
admitted
and
now
lady
lashmore
cairn
face
was
very
stern
i
will
trouble
you
no
further
he
prepared
to
depart
when
dr
cairn
whispered
lady
lashmore
tremulously
some
dreadful
thing
something
that
i
can
not
comprehend
but
that
i
fear
and
loathe
with
all
my
soul
has
come
to
me
oh
for
pity
sake
give
me
a
word
of
hope
save
for
you
i
am
alone
with
a
horror
i
can
not
name
tell
me
at
the
door
he
turned
be
brave
he
said
and
went
out
lady
lashmore
sat
still
as
one
who
had
looked
upon
gorgon
her
beautiful
eyes
yet
widely
opened
and
her
face
pale
as
death
for
he
had
not
even
told
her
to
hope
robert
cairn
was
sitting
smoking
in
the
library
a
bunch
of
notes
before
him
when
cairn
returned
to
street
his
face
habitually
fresh
coloured
was
so
pale
that
his
son
leapt
up
in
alarm
but
cairn
waved
him
away
with
a
characteristic
gesture
of
the
hand
sit
down
rob
he
said
quietly
i
shall
be
all
right
in
a
moment
but
i
have
just
left
a
woman
a
young
woman
and
a
beautiful
woman
whom
a
fiend
of
hell
has
condemned
to
that
which
my
mind
refuses
to
contemplate
robert
cairn
sat
down
again
watching
his
father
make
out
a
report
of
the
following
facts
continued
the
latter
beginning
to
pace
up
and
down
the
room
he
recounted
all
that
he
had
learnt
of
the
history
of
the
house
of
dhoon
and
all
that
he
had
learnt
of
recent
happenings
from
lord
and
lady
lashmore
his
son
wrote
rapidly
and
now
said
the
doctor
for
our
conclusions
mirza
the
polish
jewess
who
became
lady
lashmore
in
practised
sorcery
in
life
and
became
after
death
a
ghoul
one
who
sustained
an
unholy
existence
by
unholy
means
a
vampire
but
sir
surely
that
is
but
a
horrible
superstition
of
the
middle
ages
rob
i
could
take
you
to
a
castle
not
ten
miles
from
cracow
in
poland
where
there
are
certain
relics
which
would
for
ever
settle
your
doubts
respecting
the
existence
of
vampires
let
us
proceed
the
son
of
mirza
paul
dhoon
inherited
the
dreadful
proclivities
of
his
mother
but
his
shadowy
existence
was
cut
short
in
the
traditional
and
effective
manner
him
we
may
neglect
it
is
mirza
the
sorceress
who
must
engage
our
attention
she
was
decapitated
by
her
husband
this
punishment
prevented
her
in
the
unhallowed
life
which
for
such
as
she
begins
after
ordinary
decease
from
practising
the
horrible
rites
of
a
vampire
her
headless
body
could
not
serve
her
as
a
vehicle
for
nocturnal
wanderings
but
the
evil
spirit
of
the
woman
might
hope
to
gain
control
of
some
body
more
suitable
nurturing
an
implacable
hatred
against
all
of
the
house
of
dhoon
that
spirit
disembodied
would
frequently
be
drawn
to
the
neighbourhood
of
mirza
descendants
both
by
hatred
and
by
affinity
two
horrible
desires
of
the
spirit
mirza
would
be
gratified
if
a
dhoon
could
be
made
her
victim
the
desire
for
blood
and
the
desire
for
vengeance
the
fate
of
lord
lashmore
would
be
sealed
if
that
spirit
could
secure
incarnation
cairn
paused
glancing
at
his
son
who
was
writing
at
furious
speed
then
a
magician
more
mighty
and
more
evil
than
mirza
ever
was
or
could
be
he
continued
a
master
of
the
black
art
expelled
a
spirit
from
its
throne
and
temporarily
installed
in
its
place
the
spirit
of
mirza
my
god
sir
cried
robert
cairn
and
threw
down
his
pencil
i
begin
to
understand
lady
lashmore
said
cairn
since
she
was
weak
enough
to
consent
to
be
present
at
a
certain
has
from
time
to
time
been
she
has
been
possessed
by
the
spirit
of
a
vampire
obedient
to
the
nameless
cravings
of
that
control
she
has
sought
out
lord
lashmore
the
last
of
the
house
of
dhoon
the
horrible
attack
made
a
mighty
will
which
throughout
her
temporary
incarnation
has
held
her
like
a
hound
in
leash
has
dragged
her
from
her
prey
has
forced
her
to
remove
from
the
garments
clothing
her
borrowed
body
all
traces
of
the
deed
and
has
cast
her
out
again
to
the
pit
of
abomination
where
her
headless
trunk
was
thrown
by
the
third
baron
lashmore
lady
lashmore
brain
retains
certain
memories
they
have
been
received
at
the
moment
when
possession
has
taken
place
and
at
the
moment
when
the
control
has
been
cast
out
again
they
thus
are
memories
of
some
secret
cavern
near
dhoon
castle
where
that
headless
but
deathless
body
lies
and
memories
of
the
poignant
moment
when
the
vampire
has
been
dragged
back
her
unslaked
by
the
ruling
will
merciful
god
muttered
robert
cairn
merciful
god
can
such
things
be
they
can
be
they
are
two
ways
have
occurred
to
me
of
dealing
with
the
matter
continued
cairn
quietly
one
is
to
find
that
cavern
and
to
kill
in
the
occult
sense
by
means
of
a
stake
the
vampire
who
lies
there
the
other
which
i
confess
might
only
result
in
the
permanent
of
lady
lashmore
is
to
get
at
the
power
which
controls
this
disembodied
spirit
kill
antony
ferrara
robert
cairn
went
to
the
sideboard
and
poured
out
brandy
with
a
shaking
hand
what
his
object
he
whispered
cairn
shrugged
his
shoulders
lady
lashmore
would
be
the
wealthiest
widow
in
society
he
replied
will
know
now
continued
the
younger
man
unsteadily
that
you
are
up
against
him
have
you
i
have
told
lord
lashmore
to
lock
at
night
not
only
his
outer
door
but
also
that
of
his
for
the
rest
he
dropped
into
an
i
can
not
face
the
facts
i
the
telephone
bell
rang
cairn
came
to
his
feet
as
though
he
had
been
electrified
and
as
he
raised
the
receiver
to
his
ear
his
son
knew
by
the
expression
on
his
face
from
where
the
message
came
and
something
of
its
purport
come
with
me
was
all
that
he
said
when
he
had
replaced
the
instrument
on
the
table
they
went
out
together
it
was
already
past
midnight
but
a
cab
was
found
at
the
corner
of
street
and
within
the
space
of
five
minutes
they
were
at
lord
lashmore
house
excepting
chambers
lord
lashmore
valet
no
servants
were
to
be
seen
they
ran
away
sir
out
of
the
house
explained
the
man
huskily
when
it
happened
cairn
delayed
for
no
further
questions
but
raced
upstairs
his
son
close
behind
him
together
they
burst
into
lord
bedroom
but
just
within
the
door
they
both
stopped
aghast
sitting
bolt
upright
in
bed
was
lord
lashmore
his
face
a
dingy
grey
and
his
open
eyes
though
filming
over
yet
faintly
alight
with
a
stark
horror
dead
an
electric
torch
was
still
gripped
in
his
left
hand
bending
over
someone
who
lay
upon
the
carpet
near
the
bedside
they
perceived
sir
elwin
groves
he
looked
up
some
little
of
his
usual
had
fled
ah
cairn
he
jerked
we
both
come
too
late
the
prostrate
figure
was
that
of
lady
lashmore
a
loose
kimono
worn
over
her
she
was
white
and
still
and
the
physician
had
been
engaged
in
bathing
a
huge
bruise
upon
her
temple
she
be
all
right
said
sir
elwin
she
has
sustained
a
tremendous
blow
as
you
see
but
lord
lashmore
cairn
stepped
closer
to
the
dead
man
heart
he
said
he
died
of
sheer
horror
he
turned
to
chambers
who
stood
in
the
open
doorway
behind
him
the
door
is
open
he
said
i
had
advised
lord
lashmore
to
lock
it
yes
sir
his
lordship
meant
to
sir
but
we
found
that
the
lock
had
been
broken
it
was
to
have
been
replaced
cairn
turned
to
his
son
you
hear
he
said
no
doubt
you
have
some
idea
respecting
which
of
the
visitors
to
this
unhappy
house
took
the
trouble
to
break
that
lock
it
was
to
have
been
replaced
hence
the
tragedy
of
he
addressed
chambers
again
why
did
the
servants
leave
the
house
the
man
was
shaking
pitifully
it
was
the
laughter
sir
the
laughter
i
can
never
forget
it
i
was
sleeping
in
an
adjoining
room
and
i
had
the
key
of
his
lordship
door
in
case
of
need
but
when
i
heard
his
lordship
cry
out
quick
and
loud
sir
like
a
man
that
been
stabbed
i
jumped
up
to
come
to
him
then
as
i
was
turning
the
doorknob
of
my
room
sir
someone
something
began
to
it
was
in
here
it
was
in
here
gentlemen
it
was
her
ladyship
it
was
like
woman
i
ca
describe
it
but
it
woke
up
every
soul
in
the
house
when
you
came
in
i
dare
come
in
sir
i
ran
downstairs
and
called
up
sir
elwin
groves
before
he
came
all
the
rest
of
the
household
huddled
on
their
clothes
and
went
away
it
was
i
who
found
him
interrupted
sir
elwin
as
you
see
him
now
with
lady
lashmore
where
she
lies
i
have
for
nurses
ah
said
cairn
i
shall
come
back
groves
but
i
have
a
small
matter
to
attend
to
he
drew
his
son
from
the
room
on
the
stair
you
understand
he
asked
the
spirit
of
mirza
came
to
him
again
clothed
in
his
wife
body
lord
lashmore
felt
the
teeth
at
his
throat
awoke
instantly
and
struck
out
as
he
did
so
he
turned
the
torch
upon
her
and
recognised
his
wife
his
heart
completed
the
tragedy
and
so
to
the
laughter
of
the
sorceress
passed
the
last
of
the
house
of
dhoon
the
cab
was
waiting
cairn
gave
an
address
in
piccadilly
and
the
two
entered
as
the
cab
moved
off
the
doctor
took
a
revolver
from
his
pocket
with
some
loose
cartridges
charged
the
five
chambers
and
quietly
replaced
the
weapon
in
his
pocket
again
one
of
the
big
doors
of
the
block
of
chambers
was
found
to
be
ajar
and
a
porter
proved
to
be
yet
in
attendance
mr
ferrara
began
cairn
you
are
five
minutes
too
late
sir
said
the
man
he
left

motor

sir
chapter
xi
cairo
the
exact
manner
in
which
mental
stress
will
effect
a
man
physical
health
is
often
difficult
to
predict
robert
cairn
was
in
the
pink
of
condition
at
the
time
that
he
left
oxford
to
take
up
his
london
appointment
but
the
tremendous
nervous
strain
wrought
upon
him
by
this
series
of
events
wholly
outside
the
radius
of
normal
things
had
broken
him
up
physically
where
it
might
have
left
unscathed
a
more
highly
strung
though
less
physically
vigorous
man
those
who
have
passed
through
a
nerve
storm
such
as
this
which
had
laid
him
low
will
know
that
convalescence
seems
like
a
welcome
awakening
from
a
dreadful
dream
it
was
indeed
in
a
state
between
awaking
and
dreaming
that
robert
cairn
took
counsel
with
his
father
the
latter
more
pale
than
was
his
wont
and
somewhat
and
determined
upon
an
egyptian
i
have
made
it
all
right
at
the
office
rob
said
cairn
in
three
weeks
or
so
you
will
receive
instructions
at
cairo
to
write
up
a
series
of
local
articles
until
then
my
boy
complete
rest
and
worry
above
all
do
worry
you
and
i
have
passed
through
a
saturnalia
of
horror
and
you
less
inured
to
horrors
than
i
have
gone
down
i
do
wonder
where
is
antony
ferrara
cairn
shook
his
head
and
his
eyes
gleamed
with
a
sudden
anger
for
god
sake
do
mention
his
name
he
said
that
topic
is
taboo
rob
i
may
tell
you
however
that
he
has
left
england
in
this
unreal
frame
of
mind
then
and
as
one
but
partly
belonging
to
the
world
of
things
actual
cairn
found
himself
an
invalid
who
but
yesterday
had
been
a
hale
man
found
himself
shipped
for
port
said
found
himself
entrained
for
cairo
and
with
an
awakening
to
the
realities
of
life
an
emerging
from
an
to
lively
interest
in
the
novelties
of
egypt
found
himself
following
the
shepheard
porter
along
the
corridor
of
the
train
and
out
on
to
the
platform
a
short
drive
through
those
singular
streets
where
east
meets
west
and
mingles
in
the
sudden
violet
dusk
of
lower
egypt
and
he
was
amid
the
bustle
of
the
popular
hotel
sime
was
there
whom
he
had
last
seen
at
oxford
sime
the
phlegmatic
he
apologised
for
not
meeting
the
train
but
explained
that
his
duties
had
rendered
it
impossible
sime
was
attached
temporarily
to
an
arch√¶ological
expedition
as
medical
man
and
his
athletic
and
somewhat
bovine
appearance
contrasted
oddly
with
the
unhealthy
gauntness
of
cairn
i
only
got
in
from
wasta
ten
minutes
ago
cairn
you
must
come
out
to
the
camp
when
i
return
the
desert
air
will
put
you
on
your
feet
again
in
no
time
sime
was
unemotional
but
there
was
concern
in
his
voice
and
in
his
glance
for
the
change
in
cairn
was
very
startling
although
he
knew
something
if
but
very
little
of
certain
happenings
in
london
gruesome
happenings
centering
around
the
man
called
antony
ferrara
he
avoided
any
reference
to
them
at
the
moment
seated
upon
the
terrace
robert
cairn
studied
the
busy
life
in
the
street
below
with
all
the
interest
of
a
new
arrival
in
the
capital
of
the
near
east
more
than
ever
now
his
illness
and
the
things
which
had
led
up
to
it
seemed
to
belong
to
a
remote
dream
existence
through
the
railings
at
his
feet
a
hawker
was
thrusting
and
imploring
him
in
complicated
english
to
purchase
one
vendors
of
beads
of
fictitious
antiques
of
sweetmeats
of
and
all
that
chattering
horde
which
some
obscure
process
of
gravitation
seems
to
hurl
against
the
terrace
of
shepheard
buzzed
about
him
carriages
and
motor
cars
camels
and
donkeys
mingled
in
the
sh√¢ria
k√¢mel
pasha
voices
american
voices
guttural
german
tones
and
softly
murmured
arabic
merged
into
one
indescribable
chord
of
sound
but
to
robert
cairn
it
was
all
unspeakably
restful
he
was
quite
contented
to
sit
there
sipping
his
whisky
and
soda
and
smoking
his
pipe
sheer
idleness
was
good
for
him
and
exactly
what
he
wanted
and
idling
amid
that
unique
throng
is
idleness
sime
watched
him
covertly
and
saw
that
his
face
had
acquired
lines
lines
which
told
of
the
fires
through
which
he
had
passed
something
it
was
evident
something
horrible
had
seared
his
mind
considering
the
many
indications
of
tremendous
nervous
disaster
in
cairn
sime
wondered
how
near
his
companion
had
come
to
insanity
and
concluded
that
he
had
stood
upon
the
frontiers
of
that
grim
land
of
phantoms
and
had
only
been
plucked
back
in
the
eleventh
hour
cairn
glanced
around
with
a
smile
from
the
group
of
hawkers
who
solicited
his
attention
upon
the
pavement
below
this
is
a
delightful
scene
he
said
i
could
sit
here
for
hours
but
considering
that
it
some
time
after
sunset
it
remains
unusually
hot
does
it
rather
replied
sime
they
are
expecting
the
hot
wind
you
know
i
was
up
the
river
a
week
ago
and
we
struck
it
badly
in
assouan
it
grew
as
black
as
night
and
one
could
breathe
for
sand
it
probably
working
down
to
cairo
from
your
description
i
am
not
anxious
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
sime
shook
his
head
knocking
out
his
pipe
into
the
this
is
a
funny
country
he
said
reflectively
the
most
weird
ideas
prevail
here
to
this
day
ideas
which
properly
belong
to
the
middle
ages
for
instance
he
began
to
recharge
the
hot
bowl
it
is
not
really
time
for
consequently
the
natives
feel
called
upon
to
hunt
up
some
explanation
of
its
unexpected
appearance
their
ideas
on
the
subject
are
interesting
if
idiotic
one
of
our
arabs
we
are
excavating
in
the
fay√ªm
you
know
solemnly
assured
me
yesterday
that
the
hot
wind
had
been
caused
by
an
efreet
a
sort
of
arabian
nights
demon
who
has
arrived
in
egypt
he
laughed
gruffly
but
cairn
was
staring
at
him
with
a
curious
expression
sime
continued
when
i
got
to
cairo
this
evening
i
found
news
of
the
efreet
had
preceded
me
honestly
cairn
it
is
all
over
the
town
the
native
town
i
mean
all
the
shopkeepers
in
the
m√ªski
are
talking
about
it
if
a
puff
of
should
come
i
believe
they
would
permanently
shut
up
shop
and
hide
in
their
cellars
if
they
have
any
i
am
rather
hazy
on
modern
egyptian
architecture
cairn
nodded
his
head
absently
you
laugh
he
said
but
the
active
force
of
a
superstition
what
we
call
a
superstition
is
sometimes
a
terrible
thing
sime
stared
eh
the
medical
man
had
suddenly
come
uppermost
he
recollected
that
this
class
of
discussion
was
probably
taboo
you
may
doubt
the
existence
of
efreets
continued
cairn
but
neither
you
nor
i
can
doubt
the
creative
power
of
thought
if
a
trained
hypnotist
by
sheer
concentration
can
persuade
his
subject
that
the
latter
sits
upon
the
brink
of
a
river
fishing
when
actually
he
sits
upon
a
platform
in
a
what
result
should
you
expect
from
a
concentration
of
thousands
of
native
minds
upon
the
idea
that
an
efreet
is
visiting
egypt
sime
stared
in
a
dull
way
peculiar
to
him
rather
a
poser
he
said
i
have
a
glimmer
of
a
notion
what
you
mean
do
you
think
if
you
mean
do
i
think
the
result
would
be
the
creation
of
an
efreet
no
i
do
i
hardly
mean
that
either
replied
cairn
but
this
wave
of
superstition
can
not
be
entirely
unproductive
all
that
thought
energy
directed
to
one
point
sime
stood
up
we
shall
get
out
of
our
depth
he
replied
conclusively
he
considered
the
ground
of
discussion
an
unhealthy
one
this
was
the
territory
adjoining
that
of
insanity
a
from
india
proffered
his
services
incessantly
growled
sime
hold
on
said
cairn
smiling
this
chap
is
not
an
egyptian
let
us
ask
him
if
he
has
heard
the
rumour
respecting
the
efreet
sime
reseated
himself
rather
unwillingly
the
spread
his
little
carpet
and
knelt
down
in
order
to
read
the
palm
of
his
hypothetical
client
but
cairn
waved
him
aside
i
do
want
my
fortune
told
he
said
but
i
will
give
you
your
fee
with
a
smile
at
sime
for
a
few
minutes
conversation
yes
sir
yes
sir
the
indian
was
all
attention
why
cairn
pointed
forensically
at
the
why
is
come
so
early
this
year
the
indian
spread
his
hands
palms
upward
how
should
i
know
he
replied
in
his
soft
melodious
voice
i
am
not
of
egypt
i
can
only
say
what
is
told
to
me
by
the
egyptians
and
what
is
told
to
you
sime
rested
his
hands
upon
his
knees
bending
forward
curiously
he
was
palpably
anxious
that
cairn
should
have
confirmation
of
the
efreet
story
from
the
indian
they
tell
me
sir
the
man
voice
sank
musically
low
that
a
thing
very
evil
he
tapped
a
long
brown
finger
upon
his
breast
not
as
i
am
he
tapped
sime
upon
the
knee
not
as
he
your
friend
he
thrust
the
long
finger
at
cairn
not
as
you
sir
not
a
man
at
all
though
something
like
a
man
not
having
any
father
and
mother
you
mean
suggested
sime
a
spirit
the
shook
his
head
they
tell
me
sir
not
a
spirit
a
man
but
not
as
other
men
a
very
very
bad
man
one
that
the
great
king
long
long
ago
the
king
you
call
wise
solomon
suggested
cairn
yes
yes
suleyman
one
that
he
when
he
banish
all
the
tribe
of
the
demons
from
earth
one
that
he
not
found
one
he
overlooked
jerked
sime
yes
yes
overlook
a
very
evil
man
my
gentlemen
they
tell
me
he
has
come
to
egypt
he
come
not
from
the
sea
but
across
the
great
desert
the
libyan
desert
suggested
sime
the
man
shook
his
head
seeking
for
words
the
arabian
desert
no
no
away
beyond
far
up
in
africa
he
waved
his
long
arms
dramatically
far
far
up
beyond
the
s√ªdan
the
sahara
desert
proposed
sime
yes
yes
it
is
sahara
desert
come
across
the
sahara
desert
and
is
come
to
khart√ªm
how
did
he
get
there
asked
cairn
the
indian
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
can
not
say
but
next
he
come
to
wady
halfa
then
he
is
in
assouan
and
from
assouan
he
come
down
to
luxor
yesterday
an
egyptian
friend
told
me
is
in
the
fay√ªm
therefore
is
there
the
man
of
evil
for
he
bring
the
hot
wind
with
him
the
indian
was
growing
impressive
and
two
american
tourists
stopped
to
listen
to
his
words
he
spoke
now
almost
in
a
whisper
glancing
about
him
as
if
apprehensive
of
being
overheard
he
may
be
here
in
cairo
bringing
with
him
the
scorching
breath
of
the
desert
the
scorpion
wind
he
stood
up
casting
off
the
mystery
with
which
he
had
invested
his
story
and
smiling
insinuatingly
his
work
was
done
his
fee
was
due
sime
rewarded
him
with
five
piastres
and
he
departed
bowing
you
know
sime
cairn
began
to
speak
staring
absently
the
while
after
the
as
he
descended
the
carpeted
steps
and
rejoined
the
throng
on
the
sidewalk
below
you
know
if
a
man
anyone
could
take
advantage
of
such
a
wave
of
thought
as
this
which
is
now
sweeping
through
egypt
if
he
could
cause
it
to
concentrate
upon
him
as
it
were
do
you
think
that
it
would
enable
him
to
transcend
the
normal
to
do
phenomenal
things
by
what
process
should
you
propose
to
make
yourself
such
a
focus
i
was
speaking
impersonally
sime
it
might
be
possible
it
might
be
possible
to
dress
for
dinner
snapped
sime
if
we
shut
up
talking
nonsense
there
a

all
else
was
forgotten
and
only
the
madness
the
infectious
madness
of
the
night
claimed
his
mind
in
and
out
of
the
strangely
attired
groups
darted
his
agile
quarry
all
but
captured
a
score
of
times
but
always
eluding
him
sime
he
had
hopelessly
lost
as
around
fountain
and
arbour
and
palm
trunk
he
leapt
in
pursuit
of
the
elusive
then
in
a
shadowed
corner
of
the
garden
he
trapped
her
plunging
his
hand
into
the
bag
of
confetti
which
he
carried
he
leapt
exulting
to
his
revenge
when
a
sudden
gust
of
wind
passed
sibilantly
through
the
palm
tops
and
glancing
upward
cairn
saw
that
the
blue
sky
was
overcast
and
the
stars
gleaming
dimly
as
through
a
veil
that
moment
of
hesitancy
proved
fatal
to
his
project
for
with
a
little
excited
scream
the
girl
dived
under
his
outstretched
arm
and
fled
back
towards
the
fountain
he
turned
to
pursue
again
when
a
second
puff
of
wind
stronger
than
the
first
set
waving
the
palm
fronds
and
showered
dry
leaves
upon
the
confetti
carpet
of
the
garden
the
band
played
loudly
the
murmur
of
conversation
rose
to
something
like
a
roar
but
above
it
whistled
the
increasing
breeze
and
there
was
a
sort
of
grittiness
in
the
air
then
proclaimed
by
a
furious
lashing
of
the
fronds
above
burst
the
wind
in
all
its
fury
it
seemed
to
beat
down
into
the
garden
in
waves
of
heat
huge
leaves
began
to
fall
from
the
tree
tops
and
the
trunks
bent
before
the
fury
from
the
desert
the
atmosphere
grew
hazy
with
impalpable
dust
and
the
stars
were
wholly
obscured
commenced
a
stampede
from
the
garden
shrill
with
fear
rose
a
scream
from
the
heart
of
the
throng
a
scorpion
a
scorpion
panic
threatened
but
fortunately
the
doors
were
wide
so
that
without
disaster
the
whole
fantastic
company
passed
into
the
hotel
and
even
the
military
band
retired
cairn
perceived
that
he
alone
remained
in
the
garden
and
glancing
along
the
path
in
the
direction
of
the
fountain
he
saw
a
blotchy
drab
creature
fully
four
inches
in
length
running
zigzag
towards
him
it
was
a
huge
scorpion
but
even
as
he
leapt
forward
to
crush
it
it
turned
and
crept
in
amid
the
tangle
of
flowers
beside
the
path
where
it
was
lost
from
view
the
scorching
wind
grew
momentarily
fiercer
and
cairn
entering
behind
a
few
straggling
revellers
found
something
ominous
and
dreadful
in
its
sudden
fury
at
the
threshold
he
turned
and
looked
back
upon
the
gaily
lighted
garden
the
paper
lamps
were
thrashing
in
the
wind
many
extinguished
others
were
in
flames
a
number
of
electric
globes
fell
from
their
fastenings
amid
the
palm
tops
and
burst
upon
the
ground
the
pleasure
garden
was
now
a
battlefield
beset
with
dangers
and
he
fully
appreciated
the
anxiety
of
the
company
to
get
within
doors
where
chrysanthemum
and
turban
and
uraeus
and
indian
plume
had
mingled
gaily
no
soul
remained
but
yet
he
was
in
error
someone
did
remain
as
if
embodying
the
fear
that
in
a
few
short
minutes
had
emptied
the
garden
out
beneath
the
waving
lanterns
the
flying
the
whirling
dust
pacing
sombrely
from
shadow
to
light
and
to
shadow
again
advancing
towards
the
hotel
steps
came
the
figure
of
one
sandalled
and
wearing
the
short
white
tunic
of
ancient
egypt
his
arms
were
bare
and
he
carried
a
long
staff
but
rising
hideously
upon
his
shoulders
was
a
which
seemed
to
grin
the
mask
of
set
set
the
destroyer
god
of
the
underworld
cairn
alone
of
all
the
crowd
saw
the
strange
figure
for
the
reason
that
cairn
alone
faced
towards
the
garden
the
gruesome
mask
seemed
to
fascinate
him
he
could
not
take
his
gaze
from
that
weird
advancing
god
he
felt
impelled
hypnotically
to
stare
at
the
gleaming
eyes
set
in
the
saurian
head
the
mask
was
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
and
still
cairn
stood
rigid
when
as
the
sandalled
foot
was
set
upon
the
first
step
a
breeze
and
hot
as
from
a
furnace
door
blew
fully
into
the
hotel
blinding
him
a
chorus
arose
from
the
crowd
at
his
back
and
many
voices
cried
out
for
doors
to
be
shut
someone
tapped
him
on
the
shoulder
and
spun
him
about
by
god
it
was
sime
who
now
had
him
by
the
arm
has
come
with
a
vengeance
they
tell
me
that
they
have
never
had
anything
like
it
the
native
servants
were
closing
and
fastening
the
doors
the
night
was
now
as
black
as
erebus
and
the
wind
was
howling
about
the
building
with
the
voices
of
a
million
lost
souls
cairn
glanced
back
across
his
shoulder
men
were
drawing
heavy
curtains
across
the
doors
and
windows
they
have
shut
him
out
sime
he
said
sime
stared
in
his
dull
fashion
you
surely
saw
him
persisted
cairn
irritably
the
man
in
the
mask
of
set
he
was
coming
in
just
behind
me
sime
strode
forward
pulled
the
curtains
aside
and
peered
out
into
the
deserted
garden
not
a
soul
old
man
he
declared
you
must
have
seen
the
efreet
chapter
xiii
the
scorpion
wind
this
sudden
and
appalling
change
of
weather
had
sadly
affected
the
mood
of
the
gathering
that
part
of
the
carnival
planned
to
take
place
in
the
garden
was
perforce
abandoned
together
with
the
firework
display
a
halfhearted
attempt
was
made
at
dancing
but
the
howling
of
the
wind
and
the
omnipresent
dust
perpetually
reminded
the
that
raged
without
raged
with
a
violence
unparalleled
in
the
experience
of
the
oldest
residents
this
was
a
a
terror
of
the
sahara
descended
upon
cairo
but
there
were
few
departures
although
many
of
the
visitors
who
had
long
distances
to
go
especially
those
from
mena
house
discussed
the
advisability
of
leaving
before
this
unique
storm
should
have
grown
even
worse
the
general
tendency
though
was
markedly
gregarious
safety
seemed
to
be
with
the
crowd
amid
the
gaiety
where
music
and
laughter
were
rather
than
in
the
streets
guess
we
outstayed
our
welcome
confided
an
american
lady
to
sime
egypt
wants
to
drive
us
all
home
now
possibly
he
replied
with
a
smile
the
season
has
run
very
late
this
year
and
so
this
sort
of
thing
is
more
or
less
to
be
expected
the
orchestra
struck
up
a
lively
and
a
few
of
the
more
enthusiastic
dancers
accepted
the
invitation
but
the
bulk
of
the
company
thronged
around
the
edge
of
the
floor
acting
as
spectators
cairn
and
sime
wedged
a
way
through
the
heterogeneous
crowd
to
the
american
bar
i
prescribe
a
said
sime
a
is
a
explained
sime
is
a
new
kind
of
cocktail
sacred
to
this
buffet
try
it
it
will
either
kill
you
or
cure
you
cairn
smiled
rather
wanly
i
must
confess
that
i
need
bucking
up
a
bit
he
said
that
confounded
sand
seems
to
have
got
me
by
the
throat
sime
briskly
gave
his
orders
to
the
bar
attendant
you
know
pursued
cairn
i
can
not
get
out
of
my
head
the
idea
that
there
was
someone
wearing
a
crocodile
mask
in
the
garden
a
while
ago
look
here
growled
sime
studying
the
operations
of
the
cocktail
manufacturer
suppose
there
were
what
about
it
well
it
odd
that
nobody
else
saw
him
i
suppose
it
has
occurred
to
you
that
the
fellow
might
have
removed
his
mask
cairn
shook
his
head
slowly
i
do
think
so
he
declared
i
have
seen
him
anywhere
in
the
hotel
seen
him
sime
turned
his
dull
gaze
upon
the
speaker
how
should
you
know
him
cairn
raised
his
hand
to
his
forehead
in
an
oddly
helpless
way
no
of
course
not
it
very
extraordinary
they
took
their
seats
at
a
small
table
and
in
mutual
silence
loaded
and
lighted
their
pipes
sime
in
common
with
many
young
and
enthusiastic
medical
men
had
theories
theories
of
that
revolutionary
sort
which
only
harsh
experience
can
shatter
secretly
he
was
disposed
to
ascribe
all
the
ills
to
which
flesh
is
heir
primarily
to
a
disordered
nervous
system
it
was
evident
that
cairn
mind
persistently
ran
along
a
particular
groove
something
lay
back
of
all
this
erratic
talk
he
had
clearly
invested
the
mask
of
set
with
a
curious
individuality
i
gather
that
you
had
a
stiff
bout
of
it
in
london
sime
said
suddenly
cairn
nodded
beastly
stiff
there
is
a
lot
of
sound
reason
in
your
nervous
theory
sime
it
was
touch
and
go
with
me
for
days
i
am
told
yet
pathologically
i
was
a
hale
man
that
would
seem
to
show
how
nerves
can
kill
just
a
series
of
shocks
horrors
one
piled
upon
another
did
as
much
for
me
as
influenza
pneumonia
and
two
or
three
other
ailments
together
could
have
done
sime
shook
his
head
wisely
this
was
in
accordance
with
his
ideas
you
know
antony
ferrara
continued
cairn
well
he
has
done
this
for
me
his
damnable
practices
are
worse
than
any
disease
sime
the
man
is
a
pestilence
although
the
law
can
not
touch
him
although
no
jury
can
convict
him
he
is
a
murderer
he
controls
forces
sime
was
watching
him
intently
it
will
give
you
some
idea
sime
of
the
pitch
to
which
things
had
come
when
i
tell
you
that
my
father
drove
to
ferrara
rooms
one
night
with
a
loaded
revolver
in
his
pocket
for
sime
hesitated
for
protection
no
cairn
leant
forward
across
the
table
to
shoot
him
sime
shoot
him
on
sight
as
one
shoots
a
mad
dog
are
you
serious
as
god
is
my
witness
if
antony
ferrara
had
been
in
his
rooms
that
night
my
father
would
have
killed
him
it
would
have
been
a
shocking
scandal
it
would
have
been
a
martyrdom
the
man
who
removes
antony
ferrara
from
the
earth
will
be
doing
mankind
a
service
worthy
of
the
highest
reward
he
is
unfit
to
live
sometimes
i
can
not
believe
that
he
does
live
i
expect
to
wake
up
and
find
that
he
was
a
figure
of
a
particularly
evil
dream
this
incident
the
call
at
his
rooms
occurred
just
before
your
illness
the
thing
which
he
had
attempted
that
night
was
the
last
straw
sime
it
broke
me
down
from
the
time
that
he
left
oxford
antony
ferrara
has
pursued
a
deliberate
course
of
crime
of
crime
so
cunning
so
unusual
and
based
upon
such
amazing
and
unholy
knowledge
that
no
breath
of
suspicion
has
touched
him
sime
you
remember
a
girl
i
told
you
about
at
oxford
one
evening
a
girl
who
came
to
visit
him
sime
nodded
slowly
well
he
killed
her
oh
there
is
no
doubt
about
it
i
saw
her
body
in
the
hospital
had
he
killed
her
then
how
only
he
and
the
god
who
permits
him
to
exist
can
answer
that
sime
he
killed
her
without
coming
anywhere
near
her
and
he
killed
his
adoptive
father
sir
michael
ferrara
by
the
same
unholy
means
sime
watched
him
but
offered
no
comment
it
was
hushed
up
of
course
there
is
no
existing
law
which
could
be
used
against
him
law
they
are
ruled
out
sime
the
laws
that
have
reached
him
but
he
would
have
been
burnt
at
the
stake
in
the
middle
ages
i
see
sime
drummed
his
fingers
upon
the
table
you
had
those
ideas
about
him
at
oxford
and
does
cairn
seriously
believe
the
same
he
does
so
would
you
you
could
not
doubt
it
sime
not
for
a
moment
if
you
had
seen
what
we
have
seen
his
eyes
blazed
into
a
sudden
fury
suggestive
of
his
old
robust
self
he
tried
night
after
night
by
means
of
the
same
accursed
sorcery
which
everyone
thought
buried
in
the
ruins
of
thebes
to
kill
he
projected
things
suggested
these
things
to
your
mind
something
like
that
i
saw
or
thought
i
saw
and
smelt
pah
i
seem
to
smell
them
now
beetles
you
know
from
the
skull
of
a
mummy
my
rooms
were
thick
with
them
it
brought
me
very
near
to
bedlam
sime
oh
it
was
not
merely
imaginary
my
father
and
i
caught
him
he
glanced
across
at
the
other
you
read
of
the
death
of
lord
lashmore
it
was
just
after
you
came
out
yes
heart
it
was
his
heart
yes
but
ferrara
was
responsible
that
was
the
business
which
led
my
father
to
drive
to
ferrara
rooms
with
a
loaded
revolver
in
his
pocket
the
wind
was
shaking
the
windows
and
whistling
about
the
building
with
demoniacal
fury
as
if
seeking
admission
the
band
played
a
popular
waltz
and
in
and
out
of
the
open
doors
came
and
went
groups
representative
of
many
ages
and
many
nationalities
ferrara
began
sime
slowly
was
always
a
detestable
man
with
his
sleek
black
hair
and
ivory
face
those
long
eyes
of
his
had
an
expression
which
always
tempted
me
to
hit
him
sir
michael
if
what
you
say
is
true
and
after
all
cairn
it
only
goes
to
show
how
little
we
know
of
the
nervous
system
literally
took
a
viper
to
his
bosom
he
did
antony
ferrara
was
his
adopted
son
of
course
god
knows
to
what
evil
brood
he
really
belongs
both
were
silent
for
a
while
then
gracious
heavens
cairn
started
to
his
feet
so
wildly
as
almost
to
upset
the
table
look
sime
look
he
cried
sime
was
not
the
only
man
in
the
bar
to
hear
and
to
heed
his
words
sime
looking
in
the
direction
indicated
by
cairn
extended
finger
received
a
vague
impression
that
a
grotesque
figure
had
appeared
momentarily
in
the
doorway
opening
upon
the
room
where
the
dancers
were
then
it
was
gone
again
if
it
had
ever
been
there
and
he
was
supporting
cairn
who
swayed
dizzily
and
had
become
ghastly
pale
sime
imagined
that
the
heated
air
had
grown
suddenly
even
more
heated
curious
eyes
were
turned
upon
his
companion
who
now
sank
back
into
his
chair
muttering
the
mask
the
mask
i
think
i
saw
the
chap
who
seems
to
worry
you
so
much
said
sime
soothingly
wait
here
i
will
tell
the
waiter
to
bring
you
a
dose
of
brandy
and
whatever
you
do
do
get
excited
he
made
for
the
door
pausing
and
giving
an
order
to
a
waiter
on
his
way
and
pushed
into
the
crowd
outside
it
was
long
past
midnight
and
the
gaiety
which
had
been
resumed
seemed
of
a
forced
and
feverish
sort
some
of
the
visitors
were
leaving
and
a
breath
of
hot
wind
swept
in
from
the
open
doors
a
pretty
girl
wearing
a
who
with
two
similarly
attired
companions
was
making
her
way
to
the
entrance
attracted
his
attention
she
seemed
to
be
on
the
point
of
swooning
he
recognised
the
trio
for
the
same
that
had
pelted
cairn
and
himself
with
confetti
earlier
in
the
evening
the
sudden
heat
has
affected
your
friend
he
said
stepping
up
to
them
my
name
is
sime
may
i
offer
you
my
assistance
the
offer
was
accepted
and
with
the
three
he
passed
out
on
to
the
terrace
where
the
dust
grated
beneath
the
tread
and
helped
the
fainting
girl
into
an
the
night
was
thunderously
black
the
heat
almost
insufferable
and
the
tall
palms
in
front
of
the
hotel
bowed
before
the
might
of
the
scorching
wind
as
the
vehicle
drove
off
sime
stood
for
a
moment
looking
after
it
his
face
was
very
grave
for
there
was
a
look
in
the
bright
eyes
of
the
girl
in
the
which
professionally
he
did
not
like
turning
up
the
steps
he
learnt
from
the
manager
that
several
visitors
had
succumbed
to
the
heat
there
was
something
furtive
in
the
manner
of
his
informant
glance
and
sime
looked
at
him
significantly
brings
clouds
of
septic
dust
with
it
he
said
let
us
hope
that
these
attacks
are
due
to
nothing
more
than
the
unexpected
rise
in
the
temperature
an
air
of
uneasiness
prevailed
now
throughout
the
hotel
the
wind
had
considerably
abated
and
crowds
were
leaving
pouring
from
the
steps
into
the
deserted
street
a
dreamlike
company
colonel
royland
took
sime
aside
as
the
latter
was
making
his
way
back
to
the
buffet
the
colonel
whose
regiment
was
stationed
at
the
citadel
had
known
sime
almost
from
childhood
you
know
my
boy
he
said
i
should
never
have
allowed
eileen
his
daughter
to
remain
in
cairo
if
i
had
foreseen
this
change
in
the
weather
this
infernal
wind
coming
right
through
the
native
town
is
loaded
with
infection
has
it
affected
her
then
asked
sime
anxiously
she
nearly
fainted
in
the
replied
the
colonel
her
mother
took
her
home
half
an
hour
ago
i
looked
for
you
everywhere
but
could
find
you
quite
a
number
have
succumbed
said
sime
eileen
seemed
to
be
slightly
hysterical
continued
the
colonel
she
persisted
that
someone
wearing
a
crocodile
mask
had
been
standing
beside
her
at
the
moment
that
she
was
taken
sime
started
perhaps
cairn
story
was
not
a
matter
of
imagination
after
all
there
is
someone
here
dressed
like
that
i
believe
he
replied
with
affected
carelessness
he
seems
to
have
frightened
several
people
any
idea
who
he
is
my
dear
chap
cried
the
colonel
i
have
been
searching
the
place
for
him
but
i
have
never
once
set
eyes
upon
him
i
was
about
to
ask
if
knew
anything
about
it
sime
returned
to
the
table
where
cairn
was
sitting
the
latter
seemed
to
have
recovered
somewhat
but
he
looked
far
from
well
sime
stared
at
him
critically
i
should
turn
in
he
said
if
i
were
you
is
playing
the
deuce
with
people
i
only
hope
it
does
not
justify
its
name
and
blow
for
fifty
days
have
you
seen
the
man
in
the
mask
asked
cairn
no
replied
sime
but
he
here
alright
others
have
seen
him
cairn
stood
up
rather
unsteadily
and
with
sime
made
his
way
through
the
moving
crowd
to
the
stairs
the
band
was
still
playing
but
the
cloud
of
gloom
which
had
settled
upon
the
place
refused
to
be
dissipated
cairn
said
sime
see
you
in
the
morning
robert
cairn
with
aching
head
and
a
growing
sensation
of
nausea
paused
on
the
landing
looking
down
into
the
court
below
he
could
not
disguise
from
himself
that
he
felt
ill
not
nervously
ill
as
in
london
but
physically
sick
this
superheated
air
was
difficult
to
breathe
it
seemed
to
rise
in
waves
from
below
then
from
a
weary
glancing
at
the
figures
beneath
him
his
attitude
changed
to
one
of
tense
watching
a
man
wearing
the
crocodile
mask
of
set
stood
by
a
huge
urn
containing
a
palm
looking
up
to
the
landing
cairn
weakness
left
him
and
in
its
place
came
an
indescribable
anger
a
longing
to
drive
his
fist
into
that
grinning
mask
he
turned
and
ran
lightly
down
the
stairs
conscious
of
a
sudden
glow
of
energy
reaching
the
floor
he
saw
the
mask
making
across
the
hall
in
the
direction
of
the
outer
door
as
rapidly
as
possible
for
he
could
not
run
without
attracting
undesirable
attention
cairn
followed
the
figure
of
set
passed
out
on
to
the
terrace
but
when
cairn
in
turn
swung
open
the
door
his
quarry
had
vanished
then
in
an
just
driving
off
he
detected
the
hideous
mask
hatless
as
he
was
he
ran
down
the
steps
and
threw
himself
into
another
the
was
in
attendance
and
cairn
rapidly
told
him
to
instruct
the
driver
to
follow
the
which
had
just
left
the
man
lashed
up
his
horses
turned
the
carriage
and
went
galloping
on
after
the
retreating
figure
past
the
esbek√Æya
gardens
they
went
through
several
narrow
streets
and
on
to
the
quarter
of
the
m√ªski
time
after
time
he
thought
he
had
lost
the
carriage
ahead
but
his
own
driver
knowledge
of
the
tortuous
streets
enabled
him
always
to
overtake
it
again
they
went
rocking
along
lanes
so
narrow
that
with
outstretched
arms
one
could
almost
have
touched
the
walls
on
either
side
past
empty
shops
and
unlighted
houses
cairn
had
not
the
remotest
idea
of
his
whereabouts
save
that
he
was
evidently
in
the
district
of
the
bazaars
a
corner
was
abruptly
negotiated
and
there
ahead
of
him
stood
the
pursued
vehicle
the
driver
was
turning
his
horses
around
to
return
his
fare
was
disappearing
from
sight
into
the
black
shadows
of
a
narrow
alley
on
the
left
cairn
leaped
from
the
shouting
to
the
man
to
wait
and
went
dashing
down
the
sloping
lane
after
the
retreating
figure
a
sort
of
blind
fury
possessed
him
but
he
never
paused
to
analyse
it
never
asked
himself
by
what
right
he
pursued
this
man
what
wrong
the
latter
had
done
him
his
action
was
wholly
unreasoning
he
knew
that
he
wished
to
overtake
the
wearer
of
the
mask
and
to
tear
it
from
his
head
upon
that
he
acted
he
discovered
that
despite
the
tropical
heat
of
the
night
he
was
shuddering
with
cold
but
he
disregarded
this
circumstance
and
ran
on
the
pursued
stopped
before
an
door
which
was
opened
instantly
he
entered
as
the
runner
came
up
with
him
and
before
the
door
could
be
reclosed
cairn
thrust
his
way
in
blackness
utter
blackness
was
before
him
the
figure
which
he
had
pursued
seemed
to
have
been
swallowed
up
he
stumbled
on
gropingly
hands
outstretched
then
fell
fell
as
he
realised
in
the
moment
of
falling
down
a
short
flight
of
stone
steps
still
amid
utter
blackness
he
got
upon
his
feet
shaken
but
otherwise
unhurt
by
his
fall
he
turned
about
expecting
to
see
some
glimmer
of
light
from
the
stairway
but
the
blackness
was
unbroken
silence
and
gloom
hemmed
him
in
he
stood
for
a
moment
listening
intently
a
shaft
of
light
pierced
the
darkness
as
a
shutter
was
thrown
open
through
an
window
the
light
shone
and
with
the
light
came
a
breath
of
stifling
perfume
that
perfume
carried
his
imagination
back
instantly
to
a
room
at
oxford
and
he
advanced
and
looked
through
into
the
place
beyond
he
drew
a
swift
breath
clutched
the
bars
and
was
silent
stricken
speechless
he
looked
into
a
large
and
lofty
room
lighted
by
several
hanging
lamps
it
had
a
carpeted
divan
at
one
end
and
was
otherwise
scantily
furnished
in
the
eastern
manner
a
silver
smoked
upon
a
large
and
by
it
stood
the
man
in
the
crocodile
mask
an
arab
girl
fantastically
attired
who
had
evidently
just
opened
the
shutters
was
now
helping
him
to
remove
the
hideous
she
presently
untied
the
last
of
the
fastenings
and
lifted
the
thing
from
the
man
shoulders
moving
away
with
the
gliding
step
of
the
oriental
and
leaving
him
standing
there
in
his
short
white
tunic
and
sandalled
the
smoke
of
the
incense
curled
upward
and
played
around
the
straight
slim
figure
drew
vaporous
lines
about
the
still
ivory
face
the
handsome
sinister
face
sometimes
partly
veiling
the
long
black
eyes
and
sometimes
showing
them
in
all
their
unnatural
brightness
so
the
man
stood
looking
towards
the
barred
window
it
was
antony
ferrara
ah
dear
cairn
the
husky
musical
voice
smote
upon
cairn
ears
as
the
most
hated
sound
in
nature
you
have
followed
me
not
content
with
driving
me
from
london
you
would
also
render
cairo
my
dear
cairo
untenable
for
me
cairn
clutched
the
bars
but
was
silent
how
wrong
of
you
cairn
the
soft
voice
mocked
this
attention
is
so
harmful
to
you
do
you
know
cairn
the
sudanese
formed
the
extraordinary
opinion
that
i
was
an
and
this
strange
reputation
has
followed
me
right
down
the
nile
your
father
my
dear
friend
has
studied
these
odd
matters
and
he
would
tell
you
that
there
is
no
power
in
nature
higher
than
the
human
will
actually
cairn
they
have
ascribed
to
me
the
direction
of
the
and
so
many
worthy
egyptians
have
made
up
their
minds
that
i
travel
with
the
storm
or
that
the
storm
follows
me
that
something
of
the
kind
has
really
come
to
pass
or
is
it
merely
coincidence
cairn
who
can
say
motionless
immobile
save
for
a
slow
smile
antony
ferrara
stood
and
cairn
kept
his
eyes
upon
the
evil
face
and
with
trembling
hands
clutched
the
bars
it
is
certainly
odd
is
it
not
resumed
the
taunting
voice
that
so
violent
too
should
thus
descend
upon
the
cairene
season
i
only
arrived
from
the
fay√ªm
this
evening
cairn
and
do
you
know
they
have
the
pestilence
there
i
trust
the
hot
wind
does
not
carry
it
to
cairo
there
are
so
many
distinguished
european
and
american
visitors
here
it
would
be
a
thousand
pities
cairn
released
his
grip
of
the
bars
raised
his
clenched
fists
above
his
head
and
in
a
voice
and
with
a
maniacal
fury
that
were
neither
his
own
cursed
the
man
who
stood
there
mocking
him
then
he
reeled
fell
and
remembered
no
more
all
right
old
man
you
do
quite
nicely
now
it
was
sime
speaking
cairn
struggled
upright
and
found
himself
in
bed
sime
was
seated
beside
him
do
talk
said
sime
you
in
hospital
i
do
the
talking
you
listen
i
saw
you
bolt
out
of
shepheard
last
night
shut
up
i
followed
but
lost
you
we
got
up
a
search
party
and
with
the
aid
of
the
man
who
had
driven
you
ran
you
to
earth
in
a
dirty
alley
behind
the
mosque
of
four
kindly
mendicants
who
reside
upon
the
steps
of
the
establishment
had
been
awakened
by
your
blundering
in
among
them
they
were
holding
you
yes
you
were
raving
pretty
badly
you
are
a
lucky
man
cairn
you
were
inoculated
before
you
left
home
cairn
nodded
weakly
saved
you
be
all
right
in
a
couple
of
days
that
damned
has
brought
a
whiff
of
the
plague
from
somewhere
curiously
enough
over
fifty
per
cent
of
the
cases
spotted
so
far
are
people
who
were
at
the
carnival
some
of
them
cairn
but
we
wo
discuss
that
now
i
was
afraid
of
it
last
night
that
why
i
kept
my
eye
on
you
my
boy
you
were
delirious
when
you
bolted
out
of
the
hotel
was
i
said
cairn
wearily
and
lay
back
on
the
pillow
perhaps
i
was
chapter
xiv
cairn
arrives
bruce
cairn
stepped
into
the
boat
which
was
to
take
him
ashore
and
as
it
swung
away
from
the
side
of
the
liner
sought
to
divert
his
thoughts
by
a
contemplation
of
the
weird
scene
amid
the
smoky
flare
of
many
lights
amid
rising
clouds
of
dust
a
line
of
laden
toilers
was
crawling
from
the
lighters
into
the
bowels
of
the
big
ship
and
a
second
line
unladen
was
descending
by
another
gangway
above
the
jewelled
velvet
of
the
sky
swept
in
a
glorious
arc
beyond
the
lights
of
port
said
broke
through
the
black
curtain
of
the
night
and
the
moving
ray
from
the
lighthouse
intermittently
swept
the
harbour
waters
whilst
amid
the
indescribable
clamour
the
grimily
picturesque
turmoil
so
characteristic
of
the
place
the
liner
took
in
coal
for
her
run
to
rangoon
dodging
this
way
and
that
rounding
the
sterns
of
big
ships
and
disputing
the
with
lesser
craft
the
boat
made
for
shore
the
usual
delay
at
the
custom
house
the
usual
soothing
of
the
excited
officials
in
the
usual
way
and
his
was
jolting
cairn
through
the
noise
and
the
smell
of
those
rambling
streets
a
noise
and
a
smell
entirely
peculiar
to
this
of
the
near
east
he
accepted
the
room
which
was
offered
to
him
at
the
hotel
without
troubling
to
inspect
it
and
having
left
instructions
that
he
was
to
be
called
in
time
for
the
early
train
to
cairo
he
swallowed
a
whisky
and
soda
at
the
buffet
and
wearily
ascended
the
stairs
there
were
tourists
in
the
hotel
english
and
american
marked
by
a
gaping
wonderment
and
loud
with
plans
of
sightseeing
but
port
said
nay
all
egypt
had
nothing
of
novelty
to
offer
cairn
he
was
there
at
great
inconvenience
a
practitioner
of
his
repute
may
not
easily
arrange
to
quit
london
at
a
moment
notice
but
the
business
upon
which
he
was
come
was
imperative
for
him
the
charm
of
the
place
had
not
existence
but
somewhere
in
egypt
his
son
stood
in
deadly
peril
and
cairn
counted
the
hours
that
yet
divided
them
his
soul
was
up
in
arms
against
the
man
whose
evil
schemes
had
led
to
his
presence
in
port
said
at
a
time
when
many
sufferers
required
his
ministrations
in
street
he
was
haunted
by
a
phantom
a
ghoul
in
human
shape
antony
ferrara
the
adopted
son
of
his
dear
friend
the
adopted
son
who
had
murdered
his
adopter
who
whilst
guiltless
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
was
in
the
eyes
of
god
cairn
switched
on
the
light
and
seated
himself
upon
the
side
of
the
bed
knitting
his
brows
and
staring
straight
before
him
with
an
expression
in
his
clear
grey
eyes
whose
significance
he
would
have
denied
hotly
had
any
man
charged
him
with
it
he
was
thinking
of
antony
ferrara
record
the
victims
of
this
fiendish
youth
for
antony
ferrara
was
barely
of
age
seemed
to
stand
before
him
with
hands
stretched
out
appealingly
you
alone
they
seemed
to
cry
know
who
and
what
he
is
you
alone
know
of
our
awful
wrongs
you
alone
can
avenge
them
and
yet
he
had
hesitated
it
had
remained
for
his
own
flesh
and
blood
to
be
threatened
ere
he
had
taken
decisive
action
the
viper
had
lain
within
his
reach
and
he
had
neglected
to
set
his
heel
upon
it
men
and
women
had
suffered
and
had
died
of
its
venom
and
he
had
not
crushed
it
then
robert
his
son
had
felt
the
poison
fang
and
cairn
who
had
hesitated
to
act
upon
the
behalf
of
all
humanity
had
leapt
to
arms
he
charged
himself
with
a
parent
selfishness
and
his
conscience
would
hear
no
defence
dimly
the
turmoil
from
the
harbour
reached
him
where
he
sat
he
listened
dully
to
the
hooting
of
a
syren
that
of
some
vessel
coming
out
of
the
canal
his
thoughts
were
evil
company
and
with
a
deep
sigh
he
rose
crossed
the
room
and
threw
open
the
double
windows
giving
access
to
the
balcony
port
said
a
panorama
of
twinkling
lights
lay
beneath
him
the
beam
from
the
lighthouse
swept
the
town
searchingly
like
the
eye
of
some
pagan
god
lustful
for
sacrifice
he
imagined
that
he
could
hear
the
shouting
of
the
gangs
coaling
the
liner
in
the
harbour
but
the
night
was
full
of
the
remote
murmuring
inseparable
from
that
gateway
of
the
east
the
streets
below
white
under
the
moon
looked
empty
and
deserted
and
the
hotel
beneath
him
gave
up
no
sound
to
tell
of
the
many
birds
of
passage
who
sheltered
within
it
a
stunning
sense
of
his
loneliness
came
to
him
his
physical
loneliness
was
symbolic
of
that
which
characterised
his
place
in
the
world
he
alone
had
the
knowledge
and
the
power
to
crush
antony
ferrara
he
alone
could
rid
the
world
of
the
unnatural
menace
embodied
in
the
person
bearing
that
name
the
town
lay
beneath
his
eyes
but
now
he
saw
nothing
of
it
before
his
mental
vision
loomed
exclusively
the
figure
of
a
slim
and
strangely
handsome
young
man
having
jet
black
hair
lustreless
a
face
of
uniform
ivory
hue
long
dark
eyes
wherein
lurked
lambent
fires
and
a
womanish
grace
expressed
in
his
whole
bearing
and
emphasised
by
his
long
white
hands
upon
a
finger
of
the
left
hand
gleamed
a
strange
green
stone
antony
ferrara
in
the
eyes
of
this
solitary
traveller
who
stood
looking
down
upon
port
said
that
figure
filled
the
entire
landscape
of
egypt
with
a
weary
sigh
cairn
turned
and
began
to
undress
leaving
the
windows
open
he
switched
off
the
light
and
got
into
bed
he
was
very
weary
with
a
weariness
rather
of
the
spirit
than
of
the
flesh
but
it
was
of
that
sort
which
renders
sleep
all
but
impossible
around
and
about
one
fixed
point
his
thoughts
circled
in
vain
he
endeavoured
to
forget
for
a
while
antony
ferrara
and
the
things
connected
with
him
sleep
was
imperative
if
he
would
be
in
fit
condition
to
cope
with
the
matters
which
demanded
his
attention
in
cairo
yet
sleep
defied
him
every
trifling
sound
from
the
harbour
and
the
canal
seemed
to
rise
upon
the
still
air
to
his
room
through
a
sort
of
mist
created
by
the
mosquito
curtains
he
could
see
the
open
windows
and
look
out
upon
the
stars
he
found
himself
studying
the
heavens
with
sleepless
eyes
and
idly
working
out
the
constellations
visible
then
one
very
bright
star
attracted
the
whole
of
his
attention
and
with
the
dogged
persistency
of
insomnia
he
sought
to
place
it
but
could
not
determine
to
which
group
it
belonged
so
he
lay
with
his
eyes
upon
the
stars
until
the
other
veiled
lamps
of
heaven
became
invisible
and
the
patch
of
sky
no
more
than
a
setting
for
that
one
white
orb
in
this
contemplation
he
grew
restful
his
thoughts
ceased
feverishly
to
race
along
that
one
hateful
groove
the
bright
star
seemed
to
soothe
him
as
a
result
of
his
fixed
gazing
it
now
appeared
to
have
increased
in
size
this
was
a
common
optical
delusion
upon
which
he
scarcely
speculated
at
all
he
recognised
the
welcome
approach
of
sleep
and
deliberately
concentrated
his
mind
upon
the
globe
of
light
yes
a
globe
of
light
indeed
for
now
it
had
assumed
the
dimensions
of
a
lesser
moon
and
it
seemed
to
rest
in
the
space
between
the
open
windows
then
he
thought
that
it
crept
still
nearer
the
realities
the
bed
the
mosquito
curtain
the
room
were
fading
and
grateful
slumber
approached
and
weighed
upon
his
eyes
in
the
form
of
that
dazzling
globe
the
feeling
of
contentment
was
the
last
impression
which
he
had
ere
with
the
bright
star
seemingly
suspended
just
beyond
the
netting
he
slept
chapter

the
a
man
mentally
sleeps
either
dreamlessly
or
dreams
with
a
vividness
greater
than
that
characterising
the
dreams
of
normal
slumber
cairn
dreamt
a
vivid
dream
he
dreamt
that
he
was
awakened
by
the
sound
of
a
gentle
rapping
opening
his
eyes
he
peered
through
the
cloudy
netting
he
started
up
and
wrenched
back
the
curtain
the
rapping
was
repeated
and
peering
again
across
the
room
he
very
distinctly
perceived
a
figure
upon
the
balcony
by
the
open
window
it
was
that
of
a
woman
who
wore
the
black
silk
dress
and
the
white
of
the
moslem
and
who
was
bending
forward
looking
into
the
room
who
is
there
he
called
what
do
you
want
the
woman
raised
her
hand
to
her
veiled
lips
and
looked
right
and
left
as
if
fearing
to
disturb
the
occupants
of
the
adjacent
rooms
cairn
reached
out
for
his
which
lay
upon
the
chair
beside
the
bed
threw
it
over
his
shoulders
and
stepped
out
upon
the
floor
he
stooped
and
put
on
his
slippers
never
taking
his
eyes
from
the
figure
at
the
window
the
room
was
flooded
with
moonlight
he
began
to
walk
towards
the
balcony
when
the
mysterious
visitor
spoke
you
are
dr
cairn
the
words
were
spoken
in
the
language
of
dreams
that
is
to
say
that
although
he
understood
them
perfectly
he
knew
that
they
had
not
been
uttered
in
the
english
language
nor
in
any
language
known
to
him
yet
as
is
the
way
with
one
who
dreams
he
had
understood
i
am
he
he
said
who
are
you
make
no
noise
but
follow
me
quickly
someone
is
very
there
was
sincerity
in
the
appeal
spoken
in
the
softest
most
silvern
tone
which
he
had
ever
heard
he
stood
beside
the
veiled
woman
and
met
the
glance
of
her
dark
eyes
with
a
consciousness
of
some
magnetic
force
in
the
glance
which
seemed
to
set
his
nerves
quivering
why
do
you
come
to
the
window
how
do
you
know
the
visitor
raised
her
hand
again
to
her
lips
it
was
of
a
gleaming
ivory
colour
and
the
long
tapered
fingers
were
laden
with
singular
jewellery
exquisite
enamel
work
which
he
knew
to
be
ancient
egyptian
but
which
did
not
seem
out
of
place
in
this
dream
adventure
i
was
afraid
to
make
any
unnecessary
disturbance
she
replied
please
do
not
delay
but
come
at
once
cairn
adjusted
his
and
followed
the
veiled
messenger
along
the
balcony
for
a
dream
city
port
said
appeared
remarkably
substantial
as
it
spread
out
at
his
feet
its
dingy
buildings
whitened
by
the
moonlight
but
his
progress
was
dreamlike
for
he
seemed
to
glide
past
many
windows
around
the
corner
of
the
building
and
without
having
consciously
exerted
any
physical
effort
found
his
hands
grasped
by
warm
jewelled
fingers
found
himself
guided
into
some
darkened
room
and
then
possessed
by
that
doubting
which
sometimes
comes
in
dreams
found
himself
hesitating
the
moonlight
did
not
penetrate
to
the
apartment
in
which
he
stood
and
the
darkness
about
him
was
impenetrable
but
the
clinging
fingers
did
not
release
their
hold
and
vaguely
aware
that
he
was
acting
in
a
manner
which
might
readily
be
misconstrued
he
nevertheless
allowed
his
unseen
guide
to
lead
him
forward
stairs
were
descended
in
phantom
silence
many
stairs
the
coolness
of
the
air
suggested
that
they
were
outside
the
hotel
but
the
darkness
remained
complete
along
what
seemed
to
be
a
passage
they
advanced
mysteriously
and
by
this
time
cairn
was
wholly
resigned
to
the
strangeness
of
his
dream
then
although
the
place
lay
in
blackest
shadow
he
saw
that
they
were
in
the
open
air
for
the
starry
sky
swept
above
them
it
was
a
narrow
street
at
points
the
buildings
almost
met
above
wherein
he
now
found
himself
in
reality
had
he
been
in
possession
of
his
usual
faculties
awake
he
would
have
asked
himself
how
this
veiled
woman
had
gained
admittance
to
the
hotel
and
why
she
had
secretly
led
him
out
from
it
but
the
dreamer
mental
lethargy
possessed
him
and
with
the
blind
faith
of
a
child
he
followed
on
until
he
now
began
vaguely
to
consider
the
personality
of
his
guide
she
seemed
to
be
of
no
more
than
average
height
but
she
carried
herself
with
unusual
grace
and
her
progress
was
marked
by
a
certain
hauteur
at
the
point
where
a
narrow
lane
crossed
that
which
they
were
traversing
the
veiled
figure
was
silhouetted
for
a
moment
against
the
light
of
the
moon
and
through
the
fabric
he
perceived
the
outlines
of
a
perfect
shape
his
vague
wonderment
concerned
itself
now
with
the
ivory
hands
his
condition
differed
from
the
normal
dream
state
in
that
he
was
not
entirely
resigned
to
the
anomalous
misty
doubts
were
forming
when
his
dream
guide
paused
before
a
heavy
door
of
a
typical
native
house
which
once
had
been
of
some
consequence
and
which
faced
the
entrance
to
a
mosque
indeed
lay
in
the
shadow
of
the
minaret
it
was
opened
from
within
although
she
gave
no
perceptible
signal
and
its
darkness
to
cairn
dulled
perceptions
seemed
to
swallow
them
both
up
he
had
an
impression
of
a
trap
raised
of
stone
steps
descended
of
a
new
darkness
almost
palpable
the
gloom
of
the
place
effected
him
as
a
mental
blank
and
when
a
bright
light
shone
out
it
seemed
to
mark
the
opening
of
a
second
dream
phase
from
where
the
light
came
he
knew
not
cared
not
but
it
illuminated
a
perfectly
bare
room
with
a
floor
of
native
mud
bricks
a
plastered
wall
and
ceiling
a
tall
sarcophagus
stood
upright
against
the
wall
before
him
its
lid
leant
close
beside
it
and
his
black
robed
guide
her
luminous
eyes
looking
straightly
over
the
yashmak
stood
rigidly
it
she
raised
the
jewelled
hands
and
with
a
swift
movement
discarded
robe
and
and
stood
before
him
in
the
clinging
draperies
of
an
ancient
queen
wearing
the
leopard
skin
and
the
and
carrying
the
flail
of
royal
egypt
her
pale
face
formed
a
perfect
oval
the
long
almond
eyes
had
an
evil
beauty
which
seemed
to
chill
and
the
brilliantly
red
mouth
was
curved
in
a
smile
which
must
have
made
any
man
forget
the
evil
in
the
eyes
but
when
we
move
in
a
dream
world
our
emotions
become
dreamlike
too
she
placed
a
sandalled
foot
upon
the
mud
floor
and
stepped
out
of
the
sarcophagus
advancing
towards
cairn
a
vision
of
such
sinful
loveliness
as
he
could
never
have
conceived
in
his
waking
moments
in
that
strange
dream
language
in
a
tongue
not
of
east
nor
west
she
spoke
and
her
silvern
voice
had
something
of
the
tone
of
those
egyptian
pipes
whose
dree
fills
the
nights
upon
the
upper
nile
the
seductive
music
of
remote
and
splendid
wickedness
you
know
me
she
whispered
and
in
his
dream
she
seemed
to
be
a
familiar
figure
at
once
dreadful
and
worshipful
a
fitful
light
played
through
the
darkness
and
seemed
to
dance
upon
a
curtain
draped
behind
the
sarcophagus
picking
out
diamond
points
the
dreamer
groped
in
the
mental
chaos
of
his
mind
and
found
a
clue
to
the
meaning
of
this
the
diamond
points
were
the
eyes
of
thousands
of
tarantula
spiders
with
which
the
curtain
was
broidered
the
sign
of
the
spider
what
did
he
know
of
it
yes
of
course
it
was
the
secret
mark
of
egypt
of
the
beautiful
woman
whose
name
after
her
mysterious
death
had
been
erased
from
all
her
monuments
a
sweet
whisper
stole
to
his
ears
you
will
befriend
him
befriend
my
son
for
sake
and
in
his
he
found
himself
prepared
to
foreswear
all
that
he
held
holy
for
her
sake
she
grasped
both
his
hands
and
her
burning
eyes
looked
closely
into
his
your
reward
shall
be
a
great
one
she
whispered
even
more
softly
came
a
sudden
blank
and
cairn
found
himself
walking
again
through
the
narrow
street
led
by
the
veiled
woman
his
impressions
were
growing
dim
and
now
she
seemed
less
real
than
hitherto
the
streets
were
phantom
streets
built
of
shadow
stuff
and
the
stairs
which
presently
he
found
himself
ascending
were
unsubstantial
and
he
seemed
rather
to
float
upward
until
with
the
jewelled
fingers
held
fast
in
his
own
he
stood
in
a
darkened
apartment
and
saw
before
him
an
open
window
knew
that
he
was
once
more
back
in
the
hotel
a
dim
light
dawned
in
the
blackness
of
the
room
and
the
musical
voice
breathed
in
his
ear
your
reward
shall
be
easily
earned
i
did
but
test
you
strike
and
strike
truly
the
whisper
grew
sibilant
serpentine
cairn
felt
the
hilt
of
a
dagger
thrust
into
his
right
hand
and
in
the
light
looked
down
at
one
who
lay
in
a
bed
close
beside
him
at
sight
of
the
face
of
the
sleeper
the
face
with
the
long
black
lashes
resting
on
the
ivory
cheeks
he
forgot
all
else
forgot
the
place
wherein
he
stood
forgot
his
beautiful
guide
and
only
remembered
that
he
held
a
dagger
in
his
hand
and
that
antony
ferrara
lay
there
sleeping
strike
came
the
whisper
again
cairn
felt
a
mad
exultation
boiling
up
within
him
he
raised
his
hand
glanced
once
more
on
the
face
of
the
sleeper
and
nerved
himself
to
plunge
the
dagger
into
the
heart
of
this
evil
thing
a
second
more
and
the
dagger
would
have
been
buried
to
the
hilt
in
the
sleeper
breast
when
there
ensued
a
deafening
an
appalling
explosion
a
wild
red
light
illuminated
the
room
the
building
seemed
to
rock
close
upon
that
frightful
sound
followed
a
cry
so
piercing
that
it
seemed
to
ice
the
blood
in
cairn
veins
stop
sir
stop
my
god
what
are
you
doing
a
swift
blow
struck
the
dagger
from
his
hand
and
the
figure
on
the
bed
sprang
upright
swaying
dizzily
cairn
stood
there
in
the
darkness
and
as
the
voice
of
awakened
sleepers
reached
his
ears
from
adjoining
rooms
the
electric
light
was
switched
on
and
across
the
bed
the
bed
upon
which
he
had
thought
antony
ferrara
lay
he
saw
his
son
robert
cairn
no
one
else
was
in
the
room
but
on
the
carpet
at
his
feet
lay
an
ancient
dagger
the
hilt
covered
with
beautiful
and
intricate
gold
and
enamel
work
rigid
with
a
mutual
horror
these
two
so
strangely
met
stood
staring
at
one
another
across
the
room
everyone
in
the
hotel
it
would
appear
had
been
awakened
by
the
explosion
which
as
if
by
the
intervention
of
god
had
stayed
the
hand
of
cairn
had
spared
him
from
a
deed
impossible
to
contemplate
there
were
sounds
of
running
footsteps
everywhere
but
the
origin
of
the
disturbance
at
that
moment
had
no
interest
for
these
two
robert
was
the
first
to
break
the
silence
merciful
god
sir
he
whispered
huskily
how
did
you
come
to
be
here
what
is
the
matter
are
you
ill
cairn
extended
his
hands
like
one
groping
in
darkness
rob
give
me
a
moment
to
think
to
collect
myself
why
am
i
here
by
all
that
is
wonderful
why
are
here
i
am
here
to
meet
you
to
meet
me
i
had
no
idea
that
you
were
well
enough
for
the
journey
and
if
you
came
to
meet
me
why
that
it
sir
why
did
you
send
me
that
wireless
i
sent
no
wireless
boy
robert
cairn
with
a
little
colour
returning
to
his
pale
cheeks
advanced
and
grasped
his
father
hand
but
after
i
arrived
here
to
meet
the
boat
sir
i
received
a
wireless
from
the
and
due
in
the
morning
to
say
that
you
had
changed
your
mind
and
come
brindisi
cairn
glanced
at
the
dagger
upon
the
carpet
repressed
a
shudder
and
replied
in
a
voice
which
he
struggled
to
make
firm
did
not
send
that
wireless
then
you
actually
came
by
the
boat
which
arrived
last
night
and
to
think
that
i
was
asleep
in
the
same
hotel
what
an
amazing
amazing
indeed
rob
and
the
result
of
a
cunning
and
well
planned
scheme
he
raised
his
eyes
looking
fixedly
at
his
son
you
understand
the
scheme
the
scheme
that
could
only
have
germinated
in
one
mind
a
scheme
to
cause
me
your
father
to
his
voice
failed
and
again
his
glance
sought
the
weapon
which
lay
so
close
to
his
feet
partly
in
order
to
hide
his
emotion
he
stooped
picked
up
the
dagger
and
threw
it
on
the
bed
for
god
sake
sir
groaned
robert
what
were
you
doing
here
in
my
room
with
that
cairn
stood
straightly
upright
and
replied
in
an
even
voice
i
was
here
to
do
murder
i
was
under
a
spell
no
need
to
name
its
weaver
i
thought
that
a
poisonous
thing
at
last
lay
at
my
mercy
and
by
cunning
means
the
primitive
evil
within
me
was
called
up
and
braving
the
laws
of
god
and
man
i
was
about
to
slay
that
thing
thank
god
he
dropped
upon
his
knees
silently
bowed
his
head
for
a
moment
and
then
stood
up
again
as
his
son
had
always
known
him
it
had
been
a
strange
and
awful
awakening
for
robert
cairn
to
find
his
room
illuminated
by
a
lurid
light
and
to
find
his
own
father
standing
over
him
with
a
knife
but
what
had
moved
him
even
more
deeply
than
the
fear
of
these
things
had
been
the
sight
of
the
emotion
which
had
shaken
that
stern
and
unemotional
man
now
as
he
gathered
together
his
scattered
wits
he
began
to
perceive
that
a
malignant
hand
was
moving
above
them
that
his
father
and
himself
were
pawns
which
had
been
moved
mysteriously
to
a
dreadful
end
a
great
disturbance
had
now
arisen
in
the
streets
below
streams
of
people
it
seemed
were
pouring
towards
the
harbour
but
cairn
pointed
to
an
armchair
sit
down
rob
he
said
i
will
tell
my
story
and
you
shall
tell
yours
by
comparing
notes
we
can
arrive
at
some
conclusion
then
we
must
act
this
is
a
fight
to
a
finish
and
i
begin
to
doubt
if
we
are
strong
enough
to
win
he
took
up
the
dagger
and
ran
a
critical
glance
over
it
from
the
keen
point
to
the
enamelled
hilt
this
is
unique
he
muttered
whilst
his
son
spellbound
watched
him
the
blade
is
as
keen
as
if
tempered
but
yesterday
yet
it
was
made
full
five
thousand
years
ago
as
the
workmanship
of
the
hilt
testifies
rob
we
deal
with
powers
more
than
human
we
have
to
cope
with
a
force
which
might
have
awed
the
greatest
masters
which
the
world
has
known
it
would
have
called
for
all
the
knowledge
and
all
the
power
of
apollonius
of
tyana
to
have
dealt
with
antony
ferrara
undoubtedly
rob
it
was
by
the
agency
of
antony
ferrara
that
the
wireless
message
was
sent
to
you
from
the
and
o
it
was
by
the
agency
of
antony
ferrara
that
i
dreamt
a
dream
in
fact
it
was
no
true
dream
i
was
under
the
influence
of
what
shall
i
term
it
hypnotic
suggestion
to
what
extent
that
malign
will
was
responsible
for
you
and
i
being
placed
in
rooms
communicating
by
means
of
a
balcony
we
probably
shall
never
know
but
if
this
proximity
was
merely
accidental
the
enemy
did
not
fail
to
take
advantage
of
the
coincidence
i
lay
watching
the
stars
before
i
slept
and
one
of
them
seemed
to
grow
larger
as
i
watched
he
began
to
pace
about
the
room
in
growing
excitement
rob
i
can
not
doubt
that
a
mirror
or
a
crystal
was
actually
suspended
before
my
eyes
by
someone
who
had
been
watching
for
the
opportunity
i
yielded
myself
to
the
soothing
influence
and
thus
deliberately
deliberately
placed
myself
in
the
power
of
antony
ferrara
you
think
that
he
is
here
in
this
hotel
i
can
not
doubt
that
he
is
in
the
neighbourhood
the
influence
was
too
strong
to
have
emanated
from
a
mind
at
a
great
distance
removed
i
will
tell
you
exactly
what
i
dreamt
he
dropped
into
a
cane
armchair
comparative
quiet
reigned
again
in
the
streets
below
but
a
distant
clamour
told
of
some
untoward
happening
at
the
harbour
dawn
would
break
ere
long
and
there
was
a
curious
rawness
in
the
atmosphere
robert
cairn
seated
himself
upon
the
side
of
the
bed
and
watched
his
father
whilst
the
latter
related
those
happenings
with
which
we
are
already
acquainted
you
think
sir
said
robert
at
the
conclusion
of
the
strange
story
that
no
part
of
your
experience
was
real
cairn
held
up
the
antique
dagger
glancing
at
the
speaker
significantly
on
the
contrary
he
replied
i
know
that
part
of
it
was
dreadfully
real
my
difficulty
is
to
separate
the
real
from
the
phantasmal
silence
fell
for
a
moment
then
it
is
almost
certain
said
the
younger
man
frowning
thoughtfully
that
you
did
not
actually
leave
the
hotel
but
merely
passed
from
your
room
to
mine
by
way
of
the
balcony
cairn
stood
up
walked
to
the
open
window
and
looked
out
then
turned
and
faced
his
son
again
i
believe
i
can
put
that
matter
to
the
test
he
declared
in
my
dream
as
i
turned
into
the
lane
where
the
house
was
the
house
of
the
mummy
there
was
a
patch
covered
with
deep
mud
where
at
some
time
during
the
evening
a
quantity
of
water
had
been
spilt
i
stepped
upon
that
patch
or
dreamt
that
i
did
we
can
settle
the
point
he
sat
down
on
the
bed
beside
his
son
and
stooping
pulled
off
one
of
his
slippers
the
night
had
been
full
enough
of
dreadful
surprises
but
here
was
yet
another
which
came
to
them
as
cairn
with
the
inverted
slipper
in
his
hand
sat
looking
into
his
son
eyes
the
sole
of
the
slipper
was
caked
with
reddish
brown
mud
chapter
xvi
lair
of
the
spiders
we
must
find
that
house
find
the
sarcophagus
for
i
no
longer
doubt
that
it
exists
drag
it
out
and
destroy
it
should
you
know
it
again
sir
beyond
any
possibility
of
doubt
it
is
the
sarcophagus
of
a
queen
what
queen
a
queen
whose
tomb
the
late
sir
michael
ferrara
and
i
sought
for
many
months
but
failed
to
find
is
this
queen
well
known
in
egyptian
history
cairn
stared
at
him
with
an
odd
expression
in
his
eyes
some
histories
ignore
her
existence
entirely
he
said
and
with
an
evident
desire
to
change
the
subject
added
i
shall
return
to
my
room
to
dress
now
do
you
dress
also
we
can
not
afford
to
sleep
whilst
the
situation
of
that
house
remains
unknown
to
us
robert
cairn
nodded
and
his
father
stood
up
and
went
out
of
the
room
dawn
saw
the
two
of
them
peering
from
the
balcony
upon
the
streets
of
port
said
already
dotted
with
moving
figures
for
the
egyptian
is
an
early
riser
have
you
any
clue
asked
the
younger
man
to
the
direction
in
which
this
place
lies
absolutely
none
for
the
reason
that
i
do
not
know
where
my
dreaming
left
off
and
reality
commenced
did
someone
really
come
to
my
window
and
lead
me
out
through
another
room
downstairs
and
into
the
street
or
did
i
wander
out
of
my
own
accord
and
merely
imagine
the
existence
of
the
guide
in
either
event
i
must
have
been
guided
in
some
way
to
a
back
entrance
for
had
i
attempted
to
leave
by
the
front
door
of
the
hotel
in
that
condition
i
should
certainly
have
been
detained
by
the
suppose
we
commence
then
by
inquiring
if
there
is
such
another
entrance
the
hotel
staff
was
already
afoot
and
their
inquiries
led
to
the
discovery
of
an
entrance
communicating
with
the
native
quarters
this
could
not
be
reached
from
the
main
hall
but
there
was
a
narrow
staircase
to
the
left
of
the
by
which
it
might
be
gained
the
two
stood
looking
out
across
the
courtyard
upon
which
the
door
opened
beyond
doubt
said
cairn
i
might
have
come
down
that
staircase
and
out
by
this
door
without
arousing
a
soul
either
by
passing
through
my
own
room
or
through
any
other
on
that
floor
they
crossed
the
yard
where
members
of
the
kitchen
staff
were
busily
polishing
various
cooking
utensils
and
opened
the
gate
cairn
turned
to
one
of
the
men
near
by
is
this
gate
bolted
at
night
he
asked
in
arabic
the
man
shook
his
head
and
seemed
to
be
much
amused
by
the
question
revealing
his
white
teeth
as
he
assured
him
that
it
was
not
a
narrow
lane
ran
along
behind
the
hotel
communicating
with
a
maze
of
streets
almost
exclusively
peopled
by
natives
rob
said
cairn
slowly
it
begins
to
dawn
upon
me
that
this
is
the
way
i
came
he
stood
looking
to
right
and
left
and
seemed
to
be
undecided
then
we
will
try
right
he
determined
they
set
off
along
the
narrow
way
once
clear
of
the
hotel
wall
high
buildings
rose
upon
either
side
so
that
at
no
time
during
the
day
could
the
sun
have
penetrated
to
the
winding
lane
suddenly
robert
cairn
stopped
look
he
said
and
pointed
the
mosque
you
spoke
of
a
mosque
near
to
the
house
cairn
nodded
his
eyes
were
gleaming
now
that
he
felt
himself
to
be
upon
the
track
of
this
great
evil
which
had
shattered
his
peace
they
advanced
until
they
stood
before
the
door
of
the
mosque
and
there
in
the
shadow
of
a
low
archway
was
just
such
an
ancient
door
as
cairn
remembered
latticed
windows
overhung
the
street
above
but
no
living
creature
was
in
sight
he
very
gently
pressed
upon
the
door
but
as
he
had
anticipated
it
was
fastened
from
within
in
the
vague
light
his
face
seemed
strangely
haggard
as
he
turned
to
his
son
raising
his
eyebrows
interrogatively
it
is
just
possible
that
i
may
be
mistaken
he
said
so
that
i
scarcely
know
what
to
do
he
stood
looking
about
him
in
some
perplexity
adjoining
the
mosque
was
a
ruinous
house
which
clearly
had
had
no
occupants
for
many
years
as
robert
cairn
gaze
lighted
upon
its
gaping
and
doorless
porch
he
seized
his
father
by
the
arm
we
might
hide
up
there
he
suggested
and
watch
for
anyone
entering
or
leaving
the
place
opposite
i
have
little
doubt
that
this
was
the
scene
of
my
experience
replied
cairn
therefore
i
think
we
will
adopt
your
plan
perhaps
there
is
some
means
of
egress
at
the
back
it
will
be
useful
if
we
have
to
remain
on
the
watch
for
any
considerable
time
they
entered
the
ruined
building
and
by
means
of
a
rickety
staircase
gained
the
floor
above
it
moved
beneath
them
unsafely
but
from
the
divan
which
occupied
one
end
of
the
apartment
an
uninterrupted
view
of
the
door
below
was
obtainable
stay
here
said
cairn
and
watch
whilst
i
reconnoitre
he
descended
the
stairs
again
to
return
in
a
minute
or
so
and
announce
that
another
street
could
be
reached
through
the
back
of
the
house
there
and
then
they
settled
the
plan
of
campaign
one
at
a
time
they
would
go
to
the
hotel
for
their
meals
so
that
the
door
would
never
be
unwatched
throughout
the
day
cairn
determined
to
make
no
inquiries
respecting
the
house
as
this
might
put
the
enemy
upon
his
guard
we
are
in
his
own
country
rob
he
said
here
we
can
trust
no
one
thereupon
they
commenced
their
singular
and
task
in
turn
they
went
back
to
the
hotel
for
breakfast
and
watched
fruitlessly
throughout
the
morning
they
lunched
in
the
same
way
and
throughout
the
great
midday
heat
sat
hidden
in
the
ruined
building
mounting
guard
over
that
door
it
was
a
dreary
and
monotonous
day
long
to
be
remembered
by
both
of
them
and
when
the
hour
of
sunset
drew
nigh
and
their
vigil
remained
unrewarded
they
began
to
doubt
the
wisdom
of
their
tactics
the
street
was
but
little
frequented
there
was
not
the
slightest
chance
of
their
presence
being
discovered
it
was
very
quiet
too
so
that
no
one
could
have
approached
unheard
at
the
hotel
they
had
learnt
the
cause
of
the
explosion
during
the
night
an
accident
in
the
of
a
tramp
steamer
which
had
done
considerable
damage
but
caused
no
bodily
injury
we
may
hope
to
win
yet
said
cairn
in
speaking
of
the
incident
it
was
the
hand
of
god
silence
had
prevailed
between
them
for
a
long
time
and
he
was
about
to
propose
that
his
son
should
go
back
to
dinner
when
the
rare
sound
of
a
footstep
below
checked
the
words
upon
his
lips
both
craned
their
necks
to
obtain
a
view
of
the
pedestrian
an
old
man
stooping
beneath
the
burden
of
years
and
resting
much
of
his
weight
upon
a
staff
came
tottering
into
sight
the
watchers
crouched
back
breathless
with
excitement
as
the
newcomer
paused
before
the
door
and
from
beneath
his
cloak
took
out
a
big
key
inserting
it
into
the
lock
he
swung
open
the
door
it
creaked
upon
ancient
hinges
as
it
opened
inward
revealing
a
glimpse
of
a
stone
floor
as
the
old
man
entered
cairn
grasped
his
son
by
the
wrist
down
he
whispered
now
is
our
chance
they
ran
down
the
rickety
stairs
crossed
the
narrow
street
and
robert
cairn
cautiously
looked
in
around
the
door
which
had
been
left
ajar
black
against
the
dim
light
of
another
door
at
the
further
end
of
the
large
and
apartment
showed
the
stooping
figure
tap
tap
tap
went
the
stick
and
the
old
man
had
disappeared
around
a
corner
where
can
we
hide
whispered
cairn
he
is
evidently
making
a
tour
of
inspection
the
sound
of
footsteps
mounting
to
the
upper
apartments
came
to
their
ears
they
looked
about
them
right
and
left
and
presently
the
younger
man
detected
a
large
wooden
cupboard
set
in
one
wall
opening
it
he
saw
that
it
contained
but
one
shelf
only
near
the
top
when
he
returns
he
said
we
can
hide
in
here
until
he
has
gone
out
cairn
nodded
he
was
peering
about
the
room
intently
this
is
the
place
i
came
to
rob
he
said
softly
but
there
was
a
stone
stair
leading
down
to
some
room
underneath
we
must
find
it
the
old
man
could
be
heard
passing
from
room
to
room
above
then
his
uneven
footsteps
sounded
on
the
stair
again
and
glancing
at
one
another
the
two
stepped
into
the
cupboard
and
pulled
the
door
gently
inward
a
few
moments
later
the
old
caretaker
since
such
appeared
to
be
his
office
passed
out
slamming
the
door
behind
him
at
that
they
emerged
from
their
and
began
to
examine
the
apartment
carefully
it
was
growing
very
dark
now
indeed
with
the
door
shut
it
was
difficult
to
detect
the
outlines
of
the
room
suddenly
a
loud
cry
broke
the
perfect
stillness
seeming
to
come
from
somewhere
above
robert
cairn
started
violently
grasping
his
father
arm
but
the
older
man
smiled
you
forget
that
there
is
a
mosque
almost
opposite
he
said
that
is
the
his
son
laughed
shortly
my
nerves
are
not
yet
all
that
they
might
be
he
explained
and
bending
low
began
to
examine
the
pavement
there
must
be
a
in
the
floor
he
continued
do
you
think
so
his
father
nodded
silently
and
upon
hands
and
knees
also
began
to
inspect
the
cracks
and
crannies
between
the
various
stones
in
the
corner
furthest
from
the
entrance
their
quest
was
rewarded
a
stone
some
three
feet
square
moved
slightly
when
pressure
was
applied
to
it
and
gave
up
a
sound
of
hollowness
beneath
the
tread
dust
and
litter
covered
the
entire
floor
but
having
cleared
the
top
of
this
particular
stone
a
ring
was
discovered
lying
flat
in
a
circular
groove
cut
to
receive
it
the
blade
of
a
penknife
served
to
raise
it
from
its
resting
place
and
cairn
standing
astride
across
the
trap
tugged
at
the
ring
and
without
great
difficulty
raised
the
stone
block
from
its
place
a
square
hole
was
revealed
there
were
irregular
stone
steps
leading
down
into
the
blackness
a
piece
of
candle
stuck
in
a
crude
wooden
holder
lay
upon
the
topmost
cairn
taking
a
box
of
matches
from
his
pocket
very
quickly
lighted
the
candle
and
with
it
held
in
his
left
hand
began
to
descend
his
head
was
not
yet
below
the
level
of
the
upper
apartment
when
he
paused
you
have
your
revolver
he
said
robert
nodded
grimly
and
took
his
revolver
from
his
pocket
a
singular
and
most
disagreeable
smell
was
arising
from
the
trap
which
they
had
opened
but
ignoring
this
they
descended
and
presently
stood
side
by
side
in
a
low
cellar
here
the
odour
was
almost
insupportable
it
had
in
it
something
menacing
something
definitely
repellent
and
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
they
stood
hesitating
cairn
slowly
moved
the
candle
throwing
the
light
along
the
floor
where
it
picked
out
strips
of
wood
and
broken
cases
straw
packing
and
kindred
litter
until
it
impinged
upon
a
brightly
painted
slab
further
he
moved
it
and
higher
and
the
end
of
a
sarcophagus
came
into
view
he
drew
a
quick
hissing
breath
and
bending
forward
directed
the
light
into
the
interior
of
the
ancient
coffin
then
he
had
need
of
all
his
iron
nerve
to
choke
down
the
cry
that
rose
to
his
lips
by
god
whispered
his
son
swathed
in
white
wrappings
antony
ferrara
lay
motionless
before
them
the
seconds
passed
one
by
one
until
a
whole
minute
was
told
and
still
the
two
remained
inert
and
the
cold
light
shone
fully
upon
that
ivory
face
is
he
dead
robert
cairn
spoke
huskily
grasping
his
father
shoulder
i
think
not
was
the
equally
hoarse
reply
he
is
in
the
state
of
trance
mentioned
in
certain
ancient
writings
he
is
absorbing
evil
force
from
the
sarcophagus
of
the
a
footnote
a
it
seems
exceedingly
probable
that
the
sarcophagus
with
its
painted
presentment
of
the
living
person
was
the
material
basis
for
the
preservation
of
the
magical
powers
of
a
adept
vol
viii
there
was
a
faint
rustling
sound
in
the
cellar
which
seemed
to
grow
louder
and
more
insistent
but
cairn
apparently
did
not
notice
it
for
he
turned
to
his
son
and
albeit
the
latter
could
see
him
but
vaguely
he
knew
that
his
face
was
grimly
set
it
seems
like
butchery
he
said
evenly
but
in
the
interests
of
the
world
we
must
not
hesitate
a
shot
might
attract
attention
give
me
your
knife
for
a
moment
the
other
scarcely
comprehended
the
full
purport
of
the
words
mechanically
he
took
out
his
knife
and
opened
the
big
blade
good
heavens
sir
he
gasped
breathlessly
it
is
awful
awful
i
grant
you
replied
cairn
but
a
duty
a
duty
boy
and
one
that
we
must
not
shirk
i
alone
among
living
men
know
whom
and
lies
there
and
my
conscience
directs
me
in
what
i
do
his
end
shall
be
that
which
he
had
planned
for
you
give
me
the
knife
he
took
the
knife
from
his
son
hand
with
the
light
directed
upon
the
still
ivory
face
he
stepped
towards
the
sarcophagus
as
he
did
so
something
dropped
from
the
roof
narrowly
missed
falling
upon
his
outstretched
hand
and
with
a
soft
dull
thud
dropped
upon
the
mud
brick
floor
impelled
by
some
intuition
he
suddenly
directed
the
light
to
the
roof
above
then
with
a
shrill
cry
which
he
was
wholly
unable
to
repress
robert
cairn
seized
his
father
arm
and
began
to
pull
him
back
towards
the
stair
quick
sir
he
screamed
shrilly
almost
hysterically
my
god
my
god
the
appearance
of
the
roof
above
had
puzzled
him
for
an
instant
as
the
light
touched
it
then
in
the
next
had
filled
his
very
soul
with
loathing
and
horror
for
directly
above
them
was
moving
a
black
patch
a
foot
or
so
in
extent
and
it
was
composed
of
a
dense
moving
mass
of
tarantula
spiders
a
line
of
the
disgusting
creatures
was
mounting
the
wall
and
crossing
the
ceiling
ever
swelling
the
unclean
group
cairn
did
not
hesitate
to
leap
for
the
stair
and
as
he
did
so
the
spiders
began
to
drop
indeed
they
seemed
to
leap
towards
the
intruders
until
the
floor
all
about
them
and
the
bottom
steps
of
the
stair
presented
a
mass
of
black
moving
insects
a
perfect
panic
fear
seized
upon
them
at
every
step
spiders
beneath
their
feet
they
seem
to
come
from
nowhere
to
be
conjured
up
out
of
the
darkness
until
the
whole
cellar
the
stairs
the
very
fetid
air
about
them
became
black
and
nauseous
with
spiders
to
the
top
cairn
turned
snatched
out
a
revolver
and
began
firing
down
into
the
cellar
in
the
direction
of
the
sarcophagus
a
hairy
clutching
thing
ran
up
his
arm
and
his
son
uttering
a
groan
of
horror
struck
at
it
and
stained
the
tweed
with
its
poisonous
blood
they
staggered
to
the
head
of
the
steps
and
there
cairn
turned
and
hurled
the
candle
at
a
monstrous
spider
that
suddenly
sprang
into
view
the
candle
still
attached
to
its
wooden
socket
went
bounding
down
steps
that
now
were
literally
carpeted
with
insects
tarantulas
began
to
run
out
from
the
trap
as
if
pursuing
the
intruders
and
a
faint
light
showed
from
below
then
came
a
crackling
sound
and
a
wisp
of
smoke
floated
up
cairn
threw
open
the
outer
door
and
the
two
men
leapt
out
into
the
street
and
away
from
the
spider
army
white
to
the
lips
they
stood
leaning
against
the
wall
was
it
really
ferrara
whispered
robert
i
hope
so
was
the
answer
cairn
pointed
to
the
closed
door
a
fan
of
smoke
was
creeping
from
beneath
it
the
fire
which
ensued
destroyed
not
only
the
house
in
which
it
had
broken
out
but
the
two
adjoining
and
the
neighbouring
mosque
was
saved
only
with
the
utmost
difficulty
when
in
the
dawn
of
the
new
day
cairn
looked
down
into
the
smoking
pit
which
once
had
been
the
home
of
the
spiders
he
shook
his
head
and
turned
to
his
son
if
our
eyes
did
not
deceive
us
rob
he
said
a
just
retribution
at
last
has
claimed
him
pressing
a
way
through
the
surrounding
crowd
of
natives
they
returned
to
the
hotel
the
hall
porter
stopped
them
as
they
entered
excuse
me
sir
he
said
but
which
is
robert
cairn
robert
cairn
stepped
forward
a
young
gentleman
left
this
for
you
sir
half
an
hour
ago
said
the
man
a
very
pale
gentleman
with
black
eyes
he
said
you
dropped
it
robert
cairn
unwrapped
the
little
parcel
it
contained
a
penknife
the
ivory
handle
charred
as
if
it
had
been
in
a
furnace
it
was
his
own
which
he
had
handed
to
his
father
in
that
awful
cellar
at
the
moment
when
the
first
spider
had
dropped
and
a
card
was
enclosed
bearing
the
pencilled
words
with
antony
ferrara
compliments
chapter
xvii
the
story
of
ali
mohammed
saluting
each
of
the
three
in
turn
the
tall
egyptian
passed
from
cairn
room
upon
his
exit
followed
a
brief
but
electric
silence
cairn
face
was
very
stern
and
sime
with
his
hands
locked
behind
him
stood
staring
out
of
the
window
into
the
palmy
garden
of
the
hotel
robert
cairn
looked
from
one
to
the
other
excitedly
what
did
he
say
sir
he
cried
addressing
his
father
it
had
something
to
do
with
cairn
turned
sime
did
not
move
it
had
something
to
do
with
the
matter
which
has
brought
me
to
cairo
replied
the
former
yes
you
see
said
robert
my
knowledge
of
arabic
is
sime
turned
in
his
heavy
fashion
and
directed
a
dull
gaze
upon
the
last
speaker
ali
mohammed
he
explained
slowly
who
has
just
left
had
come
down
from
the
fay√ªm
to
report
a
singular
matter
he
was
unaware
of
its
real
importance
but
it
was
sufficiently
unusual
to
disturb
him
and
ali
mohammed
is
not
easily
disturbed
cairn
dropped
into
an
armchair
nodding
towards
sime
tell
him
all
that
we
have
heard
he
said
we
stand
together
in
this
affair
well
continued
sime
in
his
deliberate
fashion
when
we
struck
our
camp
beside
the
pyramid
of
m√©yd√ªm
ali
mohammed
remained
behind
with
a
gang
of
workmen
to
finish
off
some
comparatively
unimportant
work
he
is
an
unemotional
person
fear
is
alien
to
his
composition
it
has
no
meaning
for
him
but
last
night
something
occurred
at
the
camp
or
what
remained
of
the
camp
which
seems
to
have
shaken
even
ali
mohammed
iron
nerve
robert
cairn
nodded
watching
the
speaker
intently
the
entrance
to
the
m√©yd√ªm
pyramid
continued
sime
of
the
entrances
interrupted
cairn
smiling
slightly
there
is
only
one
entrance
said
sime
dogmatically
cairn
waved
his
hand
go
ahead
he
said
we
can
discuss
these
arch√¶ological
details
later
sime
stared
dully
but
without
further
comment
resumed
the
camp
was
situated
on
the
slope
immediately
below
the
only
entrance
to
the
m√©yd√ªm
pyramid
one
might
say
that
it
lay
in
the
shadow
of
the
building
there
are
tumuli
in
the
neighbourhood
part
of
a
prehistoric
cemetery
and
it
was
work
in
connection
with
this
which
had
detained
ali
mohammed
in
that
part
of
the
fay√ªm
last
night
about
ten
he
was
awakened
by
an
unusual
sound
or
series
of
sounds
he
reports
he
came
out
of
the
tent
into
the
moonlight
and
looked
up
at
the
pyramid
the
entrance
was
a
good
way
above
his
head
of
course
and
quite
fifty
or
sixty
yards
from
the
point
where
he
was
standing
but
the
moonbeams
bathed
that
side
of
the
building
in
dazzling
light
so
that
he
was
enabled
to
see
a
perfect
crowd
of
bats
whirling
out
of
the
pyramid
bats
ejaculated
robert
cairn
yes
there
is
a
small
colony
of
bats
in
this
pyramid
of
course
but
the
bat
does
not
hunt
in
bands
and
the
sight
of
these
bats
flying
out
from
the
place
was
one
which
ali
mohammed
had
never
witnessed
before
their
concerted
squeaking
was
very
clearly
audible
he
could
not
believe
that
it
was
this
which
had
awakened
him
and
which
had
awakened
the
ten
or
twelve
workmen
who
also
slept
in
the
camp
for
these
were
now
clustering
around
him
and
all
looking
up
at
the
side
of
the
pyramid
fay√ªm
nights
are
strangely
still
except
for
the
jackals
and
the
village
dogs
and
some
other
sounds
to
which
one
grows
accustomed
there
is
nothing
absolutely
nothing
audible
in
this
stillness
then
the
flapping
of
the
bat
regiment
made
quite
a
disturbance
overhead
some
of
the
men
were
only
half
awake
but
most
of
them
were
badly
frightened
and
now
they
began
to
compare
notes
with
the
result
that
they
determined
upon
the
exact
nature
of
the
sound
which
had
aroused
them
it
seemed
almost
certain
that
this
had
been
a
dreadful
scream
the
scream
of
a
woman
in
the
last
agony
he
paused
looking
from
cairn
to
his
son
with
a
singular
expression
upon
his
habitually
immobile
face
go
on
said
robert
cairn
slowly
sime
resumed
the
bats
had
begun
to
disperse
in
various
directions
but
the
panic
which
had
seized
upon
the
camp
does
not
seem
to
have
dispersed
so
readily
ali
mohammed
confesses
that
he
himself
felt
almost
afraid
a
remarkable
admission
for
a
man
of
his
class
to
make
picture
these
fellows
then
standing
looking
at
one
another
and
very
frequently
up
at
the
opening
in
the
side
of
the
pyramid
then
the
smell
began
to
reach
their
nostrils
the
smell
which
completed
the
panic
and
which
led
to
the
abandonment
of
the
camp
the
smell
what
kind
of
smell
jerked
robert
cairn
cairn
turned
himself
in
his
chair
looking
fully
at
his
son
the
smell
of
hades
boy
he
said
grimly
and
turned
away
again
naturally
continued
sime
i
can
give
you
no
particulars
on
the
point
but
it
must
have
been
something
very
fearful
to
have
affected
the
egyptian
native
there
was
no
breeze
but
it
swept
down
upon
them
this
poisonous
smell
as
though
borne
by
a
hot
wind
was
it
actually
hot
i
can
not
say
but
ali
mohammed
is
positive
that
it
came
from
the
opening
in
the
pyramid
it
was
not
apparently
in
disgust
but
in
sheer
stark
horror
that
the
whole
crowd
of
them
turned
tail
and
ran
they
never
stopped
and
never
looked
back
until
they
came
to
rekka
on
the
railway
a
short
silence
followed
then
that
was
last
night
questioned
cairn
his
father
nodded
the
man
came
in
by
the
first
train
from
wasta
he
said
and
we
have
not
a
moment
to
spare
sime
stared
at
him
i
do
understand
i
have
a
mission
said
cairn
quietly
it
is
to
run
to
earth
to
stamp
out
as
i
would
stamp
out
a
pestilence
a
certain
i
can
not
call
it
a
man
antony
ferrara
i
believe
sime
that
you
are
at
one
with
me
in
this
matter
sime
drummed
his
fingers
upon
the
table
frowning
thoughtfully
and
looking
from
one
to
the
other
of
his
companions
under
his
lowered
brows
with
my
own
eyes
he
said
i
have
seen
something
of
this
secret
drama
which
has
brought
you
cairn
to
egypt
and
up
to
a
point
i
agree
with
you
regarding
antony
ferrara
you
have
lost
all
trace
of
him
since
leaving
port
said
said
cairn
i
have
seen
and
heard
nothing
of
him
but
lady
lashmore
who
was
an
intimate
and
an
innocent
victim
god
help
her
of
ferrara
in
london
after
staying
at
the
semiramis
in
cairo
for
one
day
departed
where
did
she
go
what
has
lady
lashmore
to
do
with
the
matter
asked
sime
if
what
i
fear
be
true
replied
cairn
but
i
anticipate
at
the
moment
it
is
enough
for
me
that
unless
my
information
be
at
fault
lady
lashmore
yesterday
left
cairo
by
the
luxor
train
at
robert
cairn
looked
in
a
puzzled
way
at
his
father
what
do
you
suspect
sir
he
said
i
suspect
that
she
went
no
further
than
wasta
replied
cairn
still
i
do
not
understand
declared
sime
you
may
understand
later
was
the
answer
we
must
not
waste
a
moment
you
egyptologists
think
that
egypt
has
little
or
nothing
to
teach
you
the
pyramid
of
m√©yd√ªm
lost
interest
directly
you
learnt
that
apparently
it
contained
no
treasure
how
little
you
know
what
it
contained
sime
mariette
did
not
suspect
sir
gaston
maspero
does
not
suspect
the
late
sir
michael
ferrara
and
i
once
camped
by
the
pyramid
of
m√©yd√ªm
as
you
have
camped
there
and
we
made
a
discovery
well
said
sime
with
growing
interest
it
is
a
point
upon
which
my
lips
are
sealed
but
do
you
believe
in
black
magic
i
am
not
altogether
sure
that
i
do
very
well
you
are
entitled
to
your
opinion
but
although
you
appear
to
be
ignorant
of
the
fact
the
pyramid
of
m√©yd√ªm
was
formerly
one
of
the
the
second
greatest
in
all
the
land
of
the
nile
of
ancient
egyptian
sorcery
i
pray
heaven
i
may
be
wrong
but
in
the
disappearance
of
lady
lashmore
and
in
the
story
of
ali
mohammed
i
see
a
dreadful
possibility
ring
for
a
we
have
not
a
moment
to
waste
chapter
xviii
the
bats
rekka
was
a
mile
behind
it
will
take
us
fully
an
hour
yet
said
cairn
to
reach
the
pyramid
although
it
appears
so
near
indeed
in
the
violet
dusk
the
great
mastabah
pyramid
of
m√©yd√ªm
seemed
already
to
loom
above
them
although
it
was
quite
four
miles
away
the
narrow
path
along
which
they
trotted
their
donkeys
ran
through
the
fertile
lowlands
of
the
fay√ªm
they
had
just
passed
a
village
amid
an
angry
chorus
from
the
pariah
dogs
and
were
now
following
the
track
along
the
top
of
the
embankment
where
the
green
carpet
merged
ahead
into
the
grey
ocean
of
sand
the
desert
began
and
out
in
that
desert
resembling
some
weird
work
of
nature
rather
than
anything
wrought
by
the
hand
of
man
stood
the
gloomy
and
lonely
building
ascribed
by
the
egyptologists
to
the
pharaoh
sneferu
cairn
and
his
son
rode
ahead
and
sime
with
ali
mohammed
brought
up
the
rear
of
the
little
company
i
am
completely
in
the
dark
sir
said
robert
cairn
respecting
the
object
of
our
present
journey
what
leads
you
to
suppose
that
we
shall
find
antony
ferrara
here
i
scarcely
hope
to
him
here
was
the
enigmatical
reply
but
i
am
almost
certain
that
he
here
i
might
have
expected
it
and
i
blame
myself
for
not
having
provided
against
this
against
what
it
is
impossible
rob
for
you
to
understand
this
matter
indeed
if
i
were
to
publish
what
i
know
not
what
i
imagine
but
what
i
know
about
the
pyramid
of
m√©yd√ªm
i
should
not
only
call
down
upon
myself
the
ridicule
of
every
egyptologist
in
europe
i
should
be
accounted
mad
by
the
whole
world
his
son
was
silent
for
a
time
then
according
to
the
guide
books
he
said
it
is
merely
an
empty
tomb
it
is
empty
certainly
replied
cairn
grimly
or
that
apartment
known
as
the
king
chamber
is
now
empty
but
even
the
king
chamber
was
not
empty
once
and
there
is
another
chamber
in
the
pyramid
which
is
not
empty
if
you
know
of
the
existence
of
such
a
chamber
sir
why
have
you
kept
it
secret
because
i
can
not
its
existence
i
do
not
know
how
to
enter
it
but
i
know
it
is
there
i
know
what
it
was
formerly
used
for
and
i
suspect
that
last
night
it
was
used
for
that
same
unholy
purpose
again
after
a
lapse
of
perhaps
four
thousand
years
even
you
would
doubt
me
i
believe
if
i
were
to
tell
you
what
i
know
if
i
were
to
hint
at
what
i
suspect
but
no
doubt
in
your
reading
you
have
met
with
julian
the
apostate
certainly
i
have
read
of
him
he
is
said
to
have
practised
necromancy
when
he
was
at
carra
in
mesopotamia
he
retired
to
the
temple
of
the
moon
with
a
certain
sorcerer
and
some
others
and
his
nocturnal
operations
concluded
he
left
the
temple
locked
the
door
sealed
and
placed
a
guard
over
the
gate
he
was
killed
in
the
war
and
never
returned
to
carra
but
when
in
the
reign
of
jovian
the
seal
was
broken
and
the
temple
opened
a
body
was
found
hanging
by
its
hair
i
will
spare
you
the
particulars
it
was
a
case
of
that
most
awful
form
of
sorcery
an
expression
of
horror
had
crept
over
robert
cairn
face
do
you
mean
sir
that
this
pyramid
was
used
for
similar
purposes
in
the
past
it
has
been
used
for
many
purposes
was
the
quiet
reply
the
exodus
of
the
bats
points
to
the
fact
that
it
was
again
used
for
one
of
those
purposes
last
night
the
exodus
of
the
bats
and
something
else
sime
who
had
been
listening
to
this
strange
conversation
cried
out
from
the
rear
we
can
not
reach
it
before
sunset
no
replied
cairn
turning
in
his
saddle
but
that
does
not
matter
inside
the
pyramid
day
and
night
make
no
difference
having
crossed
a
narrow
wooden
bridge
they
turned
now
fully
in
the
direction
of
the
great
ruin
pursuing
a
path
along
the
opposite
bank
of
the
cutting
they
rode
in
silence
for
some
time
robert
cairn
deep
in
thought
i
suppose
that
antony
ferrara
actually
visited
this
place
last
night
he
said
suddenly
although
i
can
not
follow
your
reasoning
but
what
leads
you
to
suppose
that
he
is
there
now
this
answered
his
father
slowly
the
purpose
for
which
i
believe
him
to
have
come
here
would
detain
him
at
least
two
days
and
two
nights
i
shall
say
no
more
about
it
because
if
i
am
wrong
or
if
for
any
reason
i
am
unable
to
establish
my
suspicions
as
facts
you
would
certainly
regard
me
as
a
madman
if
i
had
confided
those
suspicions
to
you
mounted
upon
donkeys
the
journey
from
rekka
to
the
pyramid
of
m√©yd√ªm
occupies
fully
an
hour
and
a
half
and
the
glories
of
the
sunset
had
merged
into
the
violet
dusk
of
egypt
before
the
party
passed
the
outskirts
of
the
cultivated
land
and
came
upon
the
desert
sands
the
mountainous
pile
of
granite
its
peculiar
orange
hue
a
ghastly
yellow
in
the
moonlight
now
assumed
truly
monstrous
proportions
seeming
like
a
great
square
tower
rising
in
three
stages
from
its
mound
of
sand
to
some
three
hundred
and
fifty
feet
above
the
level
of
the
desert
there
is
nothing
more
awesome
in
the
world
than
to
find
one
self
at
night
far
from
all
in
the
shadow
of
one
of
those
edifices
raised
by
unknown
hands
by
unknown
means
to
an
unknown
end
for
despite
all
the
wisdom
of
our
modern
inquirers
these
stupendous
relics
remain
unsolved
riddles
set
to
posterity
by
a
mysterious
people
neither
sime
nor
ali
mohammed
were
of
highly
strung
temperament
neither
subject
to
those
subtle
impressions
which
more
delicate
organisations
receive
as
the
nostrils
receive
an
exhalation
from
such
a
place
as
this
but
cairn
and
his
son
though
each
in
a
different
way
came
now
within
the
of
this
temple
of
the
dead
ages
the
great
silence
of
the
desert
a
silence
like
no
other
in
the
world
the
loneliness
which
must
be
experienced
to
be
appreciated
of
that
dry
and
tideless
ocean
the
traditions
which
had
grown
up
like
fungi
about
this
venerable
building
lastly
the
knowledge
that
it
was
associated
in
some
way
with
the
sorcery
the
unholy
activity
of
antony
ferrara
combined
to
chill
them
with
a
supernatural
dread
which
called
for
all
their
courage
to
combat
what
now
said
sime
descending
from
his
mount
we
must
lead
the
donkeys
up
the
slope
replied
cairn
where
those
blocks
of
granite
are
and
tether
them
there
in
silence
then
the
party
commenced
the
tedious
ascent
of
the
mound
by
the
narrow
path
to
the
top
until
at
some
hundred
and
twenty
feet
above
the
surrounding
plain
they
found
themselves
actually
under
the
wall
of
the
mighty
building
the
donkeys
were
made
fast
sime
and
i
said
cairn
quietly
will
enter
the
pyramid
but
interrupted
his
son
apart
from
the
fatigue
of
the
operation
continued
the
doctor
the
temperature
in
the
lower
part
of
the
pyramid
is
so
tremendous
and
the
air
so
bad
that
in
your
present
state
of
health
it
would
be
absurd
for
you
to
attempt
it
apart
from
which
there
is
a
possibly
more
important
task
to
be
undertaken
here
outside
he
turned
his
eyes
upon
sime
who
was
listening
intently
then
continued
whilst
we
are
penetrating
to
the
interior
by
means
of
the
sloping
passage
on
the
north
side
ali
mohammed
and
yourself
must
mount
guard
on
the
south
side
what
for
said
sime
rapidly
for
the
reason
replied
cairn
that
there
is
an
entrance
on
to
the
first
stage
but
the
first
stage
is
nearly
seventy
feet
above
us
even
assuming
that
there
were
an
entrance
there
which
i
doubt
escape
by
that
means
would
be
impossible
no
one
could
climb
down
the
face
of
the
pyramid
from
above
no
one
has
ever
succeeded
in
climbing
up
for
the
purpose
of
surveying
the
pyramid
a
scaffold
had
to
be
erected
its
sides
are
quite
unscaleable
that
may
be
agreed
cairn
but
nevertheless
i
have
my
reasons
for
placing
a
guard
over
the
south
side
if
anything
appears
upon
the
stage
above
rob
shoot
and
shoot
straight
he
repeated
the
same
instructions
to
ali
mohammed
to
the
evident
surprise
of
the
latter
i
do
understand
at
all
muttered
sime
but
as
i
presume
you
have
a
good
reason
for
what
you
do
let
it
be
as
you
propose
can
you
give
me
any
idea
respecting
what
we
may
hope
to
find
inside
this
place
i
only
entered
once
and
i
am
not
anxious
to
repeat
the
experiment
the
air
is
unbreathable
the
descent
to
the
level
passage
below
is
stiff
work
and
apart
from
the
inconvenience
of
navigating
the
latter
passage
which
as
you
probably
know
is
only
sixteen
inches
high
the
climb
up
the
vertical
shaft
into
the
tomb
is
not
a
particularly
safe
one
i
exclude
the
possibility
of
snakes
he
added
ironically
you
have
also
omitted
the
possibility
of
antony
ferrara
said
cairn
pardon
my
scepticism
doctor
but
i
can
not
imagine
any
man
voluntarily
remaining
in
that
awful
place
yet
i
am
greatly
mistaken
if
he
is
not
there
then
he
is
trapped
said
sime
grimly
examining
a
browning
pistol
which
he
carried
unless
he
stopped
and
an
expression
almost
of
fear
crept
over
his
stoical
features
that
passage
he
muttered
with
antony
ferrara
at
the
further
end
exactly
said
cairn
but
i
consider
it
my
duty
to
the
world
to
proceed
i
warn
you
that
you
are
about
to
face
the
greatest
peril
probably
which
you
will
ever
be
called
upon
to
encounter
i
do
not
ask
you
to
do
this
i
am
quite
prepared
to
go
alone
that
remark
was
wholly
unnecessary
doctor
said
sime
rather
truculently
suppose
the
other
two
proceed
to
their
post
but
sir
began
robert
cairn
you
know
the
way
said
the
doctor
with
an
air
of
finality
there
is
not
a
moment
to
waste
and
although
i
fear
that
we
are
too
late
it
is
just
possible
we
may
be
in
time
to
prevent
a
dreadful
crime
the
tall
egyptian
and
robert
cairn
went
stumbling
off
amongst
the
heaps
of
rubbish
and
broken
masonry
until
an
angle
of
the
great
wall
concealed
them
from
view
then
the
two
who
remained
continued
the
climb
yet
higher
following
the
narrow
zigzag
path
leading
up
to
the
entrance
of
the
descending
passage
immediately
under
the
square
black
hole
they
stood
and
glanced
at
one
another
we
may
as
well
leave
our
outer
garments
here
said
sime
i
note
that
you
wear
shoes
but
i
shall
remove
my
boots
as
otherwise
i
should
be
unable
to
obtain
any
foothold
cairn
nodded
and
without
more
ado
proceeded
to
strip
off
his
coat
an
example
which
was
followed
by
sime
it
was
as
he
stooped
and
placed
his
hat
upon
the
little
bundle
of
clothes
at
his
feet
that
cairn
detected
something
which
caused
him
to
stoop
yet
lower
and
to
peer
at
that
dark
object
on
the
ground
with
a
strange
intentness
what
is
it
jerked
sime
glancing
back
at
him
cairn
from
a
hip
pocket
took
out
an
electric
lamp
and
directed
the
white
ray
upon
something
lying
on
the
splintered
fragments
of
granite
it
was
a
bat
a
fairly
large
one
and
a
clot
of
blood
marked
the
place
where
its
head
had
been
for
the
bat
was
decapitated
as
though
anticipating
what
he
should
find
there
cairn
flashed
the
ray
of
the
lamp
all
about
the
ground
in
the
vicinity
of
the
entrance
to
the
pyramid
scores
of
dead
bats
headless
lay
there
for
god
sake
what
does
this
mean
whispered
sime
glancing
apprehensively
into
the
black
entrance
beside
him
it
means
answered
cairn
in
a
low
voice
that
my
suspicion
almost
incredible
though
it
seems
was
well
founded
steel
yourself
against
the
task
that
is
before
you
sime
we
stand
upon
the
borderland
of
strange
horrors
sime
hesitated
to
touch
any
of
the
dead
bats
surveying
them
with
an
repugnance
what
kind
of
creature
he
whispered
has
done
this
one
of
a
kind
that
the
world
has
not
known
for
many
ages
the
most
evil
kind
of
creature
conceivable
a
but
what
does
he
want
with
bats
heads
the
cynonycteris
or
pyramid
bat
has
a
appendage
beside
the
nose
a
gland
in
this
secretes
a
rare
oil
this
oil
is
one
of
the
ingredients
of
the
incense
which
is
never
named
in
the
magical
writings
sime
shuddered
here
said
cairn
proffering
a
flask
this
is
only
the
overture
no
nerves
the
other
nodded
shortly
and
poured
out
a
peg
of
brandy
now
said
cairn
shall
i
go
ahead
as
you
like
replied
sime
quietly
and
again
quite
master
of
himself
look
out
for
snakes
i
will
carry
the
light
and
you
can
keep
yours
handy
in
case
you
may
need
it
cairn
drew
himself
up
into
the
entrance
the
passage
was
less
than
four
feet
high
and
generations
of
had
polished
its
sloping
granite
floor
so
as
to
render
it
impossible
to
descend
except
by
resting
one
hands
on
the
roof
above
and
lowering
one
self
foot
by
foot
a
passage
of
this
description
descending
at
a
sharp
angle
for
over
two
hundred
feet
is
not
particularly
easy
to
negotiate
and
progress
was
slow
cairn
at
every
five
yards
or
so
would
stop
and
with
the
which
he
carried
would
examine
the
sandy
floor
and
the
crevices
between
the
huge
blocks
composing
the
passage
in
quest
of
those
faint
tracks
which
warn
the
traveller
that
a
serpent
has
recently
passed
that
way
then
replacing
his
lamp
he
would
proceed
sime
followed
in
like
manner
employing
only
one
hand
to
support
himself
and
with
the
other
constantly
directing
the
ray
of
his
pocket
torch
past
his
companion
and
down
into
the
blackness
beneath
out
in
the
desert
the
atmosphere
had
been
sufficiently
hot
but
now
with
every
step
it
grew
hotter
and
hotter
that
indescribable
smell
as
of
a
decay
begun
in
remote
ages
that
rises
with
the
impalpable
dust
in
these
mysterious
labyrinths
of
ancient
egypt
which
never
know
the
light
of
day
rose
stiflingly
until
at
some
forty
or
fifty
feet
below
the
level
of
the
sand
outside
respiration
became
difficult
and
the
two
paused
bathed
in
perspiration
and
gasping
for
air
another
thirty
or
forty
feet
panted
sime
and
we
shall
be
in
the
level
passage
there
is
a
sort
of
low
artificial
cavern
there
you
may
remember
where
although
we
can
not
stand
upright
we
can
sit
and
rest
for
a
few
moments
speech
was
exhausting
and
no
further
words
were
exchanged
until
the
bottom
of
the
slope
was
reached
and
the
combined
lights
of
the
two
showed
them
that
they
had
reached
a
tiny
chamber
irregularly
hewn
in
the
living
rock
this
also
was
less
than
four
feet
high
but
its
jagged
floor
being
level
they
were
enabled
to
pause
here
for
a
while
do
you
notice
something
unfamiliar
in
the
smell
of
the
place
cairn
was
the
speaker
sime
nodded
wiping
the
perspiration
from
his
face
the
while
it
was
bad
enough
when
i
came
here
before
he
said
hoarsely
it
is
terrible
work
for
a
heavy
man
but
it
seems
to
be
reeking
i
have
smelt
nothing
like
it
in
my
life
correct
replied
cairn
grimly
i
trust
that
once
clear
of
this
place
you
will
never
smell
it
again
what
is
it
it
is
the
was
the
reply
come
the
worst
of
our
task
is
before
us
yet
the
continuation
of
the
passage
now
showed
as
an
opening
no
more
than
fifteen
to
seventeen
inches
high
it
was
necessary
therefore
to
lie
prone
upon
the
rubbish
of
the
floor
and
to
proceed
serpent
fashion
one
could
not
even
employ
one
knees
so
low
was
the
roof
but
was
compelled
to
progress
by
clutching
at
the
irregularities
in
the
wall
and
by
digging
the
elbows
into
the
splintered
stones
one
crawled
upon
for
three
yards
or
so
they
proceeded
thus
then
cairn
lay
suddenly
still
what
is
it
whispered
sime
a
threat
of
panic
was
in
his
voice
he
dared
not
conjecture
what
would
happen
if
either
should
be
overcome
in
that
burrow
deep
in
the
bowels
of
the
ancient
building
at
that
moment
it
seemed
to
him
absurdly
enough
that
the
weight
of
the
giant
pile
rested
upon
his
back
was
crushing
him
pressing
the
life
out
from
his
body
as
he
lay
there
prone
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
rubber
soles
of
cairn
shoes
directly
in
front
of
him
but
softly
came
a
reply
do
not
speak
again
proceed
as
quietly
as
possible
and
pray
heaven
we
are
not
expected
sime
understood
with
a
malignant
enemy
before
them
this
hole
in
the
rock
through
which
they
crawled
was
a
certain
he
thought
of
the
headless
bats
and
of
how
he
in
crawling
out
into
the
shaft
ahead
must
lay
himself
open
to
a
similar
fate
cairn
moved
slowly
onward
despite
their
anxiety
to
avoid
noise
neither
he
nor
his
companion
could
control
their
heavy
breathing
both
were
panting
for
air
the
temperature
was
now
deathly
a
candle
would
scarcely
have
burnt
in
the
vitiated
air
and
above
that
odour
of
ancient
rottenness
which
all
explorers
of
the
monuments
of
egypt
know
rose
that
other
indescribable
odour
which
seemed
to
stifle
one
very
soul
cairn
stopped
again
sime
knew
having
performed
this
journey
before
that
his
companion
must
have
reached
the
end
of
the
passage
that
he
must
be
lying
peering
out
into
the
shaft
for
which
they
were
making
he
extinguished
his
lamp
again
cairn
moved
forward
stretching
out
his
hand
sime
found
only
emptiness
he
wriggled
forward
in
turn
rapidly
all
the
time
groping
with
his
fingers
then
take
my
hand
came
a
whisper
another
two
feet
and
you
can
stand
upright
he
proceeded
grasped
the
hand
which
was
extended
to
him
in
the
impenetrable
darkness
and
panting
temporarily
exhausted
rose
upright
beside
cairn
and
stretched
his
cramped
limbs
side
by
side
they
stood
mantled
about
in
such
a
darkness
as
can
not
be
described
in
such
a
silence
as
dwellers
in
the
busy
world
can
not
conceive
in
such
an
atmosphere
of
horror
that
only
a
man
morally
and
physically
brave
could
have
retained
his
composure
cairn
bent
to
sime
ear
we
have
the
light
for
the
ascent
he
whispered
have
your
pistol
ready
i
am
about
to
press
the
button
of
the
lamp
a
shaft
of
white
light
shone
suddenly
up
the
rocky
sides
of
the
pit
in
which
they
stood
and
lost
itself
in
the
gloom
of
the
chamber
above
on
to
my
shoulders
jerked
sime
you
are
lighter
than
i
then
as
soon
as
you
can
reach
place
your
lamp
on
the
floor
above
and
mount
up
beside
it
i
will
follow
cairn
taking
advantage
of
the
rugged
walls
and
of
the
blocks
of
stone
amid
which
they
stood
mounted
upon
sime
shoulders
could
you
carry
your
revolver
in
your
teeth
asked
the
latter
i
think
you
might
hold
it
by
the
i
proposed
to
do
so
replied
cairn
grimly
stand
fast
gradually
he
rose
upright
upon
the
other
shoulders
then
placing
his
foot
in
a
cranny
of
the
rock
and
with
his
left
hand
grasping
a
protruding
fragment
above
he
mounted
yet
higher
all
the
time
holding
the
lighted
lamp
in
his
right
hand
upward
he
extended
his
arms
and
upward
until
he
could
place
the
lamp
upon
the
ledge
above
his
head
where
its
white
beam
shone
across
the
top
of
the
shaft
mind
it
does
not
fall
panted
sime
craning
his
head
upward
to
watch
these
operations
cairn
whose
strength
and
agility
were
wonderful
twisted
around
sideways
and
succeeded
in
placing
his
foot
on
a
ledge
of
stone
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
shaft
resting
his
weight
upon
this
he
extended
his
hand
to
the
lip
of
the
opening
and
drew
himself
up
to
the
top
where
he
crouched
fully
in
the
light
of
the
lamp
then
wedging
his
foot
into
a
crevice
a
little
below
him
he
reached
out
his
hand
to
sime
the
latter
following
much
the
same
course
as
his
companion
seized
the
extended
hand
and
soon
found
himself
beside
cairn
impetuously
he
snatched
out
his
own
lamp
and
shone
its
beams
about
the
weird
apartment
in
which
they
found
themselves
the
chamber
of
the
pyramid
right
and
left
leapt
the
searching
rays
touching
the
ends
of
the
wooden
beams
which
practically
fossilised
by
long
contact
with
the
rock
still
survive
in
that
sepulchral
place
above
and
below
and
all
around
he
directed
the
light
upon
the
litter
covering
the
rock
floor
upon
the
blocks
of
the
higher
walls
upon
the
frowning
roof
they
were
alone
in
the
king
chamber
chapter
xix
anthropomancy
there
is
no
one
here
sime
looked
about
the
place
excitedly
fortunately
for
us
answered
cairn
he
breathed
rather
heavily
yet
with
his
exertions
and
moreover
the
air
of
the
chamber
was
disgusting
but
otherwise
he
was
perfectly
calm
although
his
face
was
pale
and
bathed
in
perspiration
make
as
little
noise
as
possible
sime
who
now
that
the
place
proved
to
be
empty
began
to
cast
off
that
dread
which
had
possessed
him
in
the
found
something
ominous
in
the
words
cairn
stepping
carefully
over
the
rubbish
of
the
floor
advanced
to
the
east
corner
of
the
chamber
waving
his
companion
to
follow
side
by
side
they
stood
there
do
you
notice
that
the
abominable
smell
of
the
incense
is
more
overpowering
here
than
anywhere
sime
nodded
you
are
right
what
does
that
mean
cairn
directed
the
ray
of
light
down
behind
a
little
mound
of
rubbish
into
a
corner
of
the
wall
it
means
he
said
with
a
subdued
expression
of
excitement
that
we
have
got
to
crawl
in
sime
stifled
an
exclamation
one
of
the
blocks
of
the
bottom
tier
was
missing
a
fact
which
he
had
not
detected
before
by
reason
of
the
presence
of
the
mound
of
rubbish
before
the
opening
silence
again
whispered
cairn
he
lay
down
flat
and
without
hesitation
crept
into
the
gap
as
his
feet
disappeared
sime
followed
here
it
was
possible
to
crawl
upon
hands
and
knees
the
passage
was
formed
of
square
stone
blocks
it
was
but
three
yards
or
so
in
length
then
it
suddenly
turned
upward
at
a
tremendous
angle
of
about
one
in
four
square
were
cut
in
the
lower
face
the
smell
of
incense
was
almost
unbearable
cairn
bent
to
sime
ear
not
a
word
now
he
said
no
light
pistol
ready
he
began
to
mount
sime
following
counted
the
steps
when
they
had
mounted
sixty
he
knew
that
they
must
have
come
close
to
the
top
of
the
original
and
close
to
the
first
stage
of
the
pyramid
despite
the
shaft
beneath
there
was
little
danger
of
falling
for
one
could
lean
back
against
the
wall
while
seeking
for
the
foothold
above
cairn
mounted
very
slowly
fearful
of
striking
his
head
upon
some
obstacle
then
on
the
seventieth
step
he
found
that
he
could
thrust
his
foot
forward
and
that
no
obstruction
met
his
knee
they
had
reached
a
horizontal
passage
very
softly
he
whispered
back
to
sime
take
my
hand
i
have
reached
the
top
they
entered
the
passage
the
heavy
sickly
sweet
odour
almost
overpowered
them
but
grimly
set
upon
their
purpose
they
after
one
moment
of
hesitancy
crept
on
a
fitful
light
rose
and
fell
ahead
of
them
it
gleamed
upon
the
polished
walls
of
the
corridor
in
which
they
now
found
themselves
that
inexplicable
light
burning
in
a
place
which
had
known
no
light
since
the
dim
ages
of
the
early
pharaohs
the
events
of
that
incredible
night
had
afforded
no
such
emotion
as
this
this
was
the
crowning
wonder
and
in
its
dreadful
mystery
the
crowning
terror
of
m√©yd√ªm
when
first
that
lambent
light
played
upon
the
walls
of
the
passage
both
stopped
stricken
motionless
with
fear
and
amazement
sime
who
would
have
been
prepared
to
swear
that
the
m√©yd√ªm
pyramid
contained
no
apartment
other
than
the
king
chamber
now
was
past
mere
wonder
past
conjecture
but
he
could
still
fear
cairn
although
he
had
anticipated
this
temporarily
also
fell
a
victim
to
the
supernatural
character
of
the
phenomenon
they
advanced
they
looked
into
a
square
chamber
of
about
the
same
size
as
the
chamber
in
fact
although
they
did
not
realise
it
until
later
this
second
apartment
no
doubt
was
situated
directly
above
the
first
the
only
light
was
that
of
a
fire
burning
in
a
tripod
and
by
means
of
this
illumination
which
rose
and
fell
in
a
strange
manner
it
was
possible
to
perceive
the
details
of
the
place
but
indeed
at
the
moment
they
were
not
concerned
with
these
they
had
eyes
only
for
the
figure
beside
the
tripod
it
was
that
of
a
man
who
stood
with
his
back
towards
them
and
he
chanted
monotonously
in
a
tongue
unfamiliar
to
sime
at
certain
points
in
his
chant
he
would
raise
his
arms
in
such
a
way
that
clad
in
the
black
robe
he
assumed
the
appearance
of
a
gigantic
bat
each
time
that
he
acted
thus
the
fire
in
the
tripod
as
if
fanned
into
new
life
would
leap
up
casting
a
hellish
glare
about
the
place
then
as
the
chanter
dropped
his
arms
again
the
flame
would
drop
also
a
cloud
of
reddish
vapour
floated
low
in
the
apartment
there
were
a
number
of
vessels
upon
the
floor
and
against
the
farther
wall
only
rendered
visible
when
the
flames
leapt
high
was
some
motionless
white
object
apparently
hung
from
the
roof
cairn
drew
a
hissing
breath
and
grasped
sime
wrist
we
are
too
late
he
said
strangely
he
spoke
at
a
moment
when
his
companion
peering
through
the
ruddy
gloom
of
the
place
had
been
endeavouring
more
clearly
to
perceive
that
ominous
shape
which
hung
horrible
in
the
shadow
he
spoke
too
at
a
moment
when
the
man
in
the
black
robe
raised
his
arms
when
as
if
obedient
to
his
will
the
flames
leapt
up
fitfully
although
sime
could
not
be
sure
of
what
he
saw
the
recollection
came
to
him
of
words
recently
spoken
by
cairn
he
remembered
the
story
of
julian
the
apostate
julian
the
emperor
the
necromancer
he
remembered
what
had
been
found
in
the
temple
of
the
moon
after
julian
death
he
remembered
that
lady
lashmore
and
thereupon
he
experienced
such
a
nausea
that
but
for
the
fact
that
cairn
gripped
him
he
must
have
fallen
tutored
in
a
materialistic
school
he
could
not
even
now
admit
that
such
monstrous
things
could
be
with
a
necromantic
operation
taking
place
before
his
eyes
with
the
unholy
perfume
of
the
secret
incense
all
but
suffocating
him
with
the
dreadful
oracle
dully
gleaming
in
the
shadows
of
that
temple
of
evil
his
reason
would
not
accept
the
evidences
any
man
of
the
ancient
world
of
the
middle
ages
would
have
known
that
he
looked
upon
a
professed
wizard
upon
a
magician
who
according
to
one
of
the
most
ancient
formul√¶
known
to
mankind
was
seeking
to
question
the
dead
respecting
the
living
but
how
many
modern
men
are
there
capable
of
realising
such
a
circumstance
how
many
who
would
accept
the
statement
that
such
operations
are
still
performed
not
only
in
the
east
but
in
europe
how
many
who
witnessing
this
mass
of
satan
would
accept
it
for
verity
would
not
deny
the
evidence
of
their
very
senses
he
could
not
believe
such
an
orgie
of
wickedness
possible
a
pagan
emperor
might
have
been
capable
of
these
things
but
wondrous
is
our
faith
in
the
virtue
of
am
i
mad
he
whispered
hoarsely
or
a
shape
seemed
to
float
out
from
that
still
form
in
the
shadows
it
assumed
definite
outlines
it
became
a
woman
beautiful
with
a
beauty
that
could
only
be
described
as
awful
she
wore
upon
her
brow
the
of
ancient
egyptian
royalty
her
sole
garment
was
a
robe
of
finest
gauze
like
a
cloud
like
a
vision
she
floated
into
the
light
cast
by
the
tripod
a
voice
a
voice
which
seemed
to
come
from
a
vast
distance
from
somewhere
outside
the
mighty
granite
walls
of
that
unholy
place
spoke
the
language
was
unknown
to
sime
but
the
fierce
upon
his
wrist
grew
fiercer
that
dead
tongue
that
language
unspoken
since
the
dawn
of
christianity
was
known
to
the
man
who
had
been
the
companion
of
sir
michael
ferrara
in
upon
sime
swept
a
swift
conviction
that
one
could
not
witness
such
a
scene
as
this
and
live
and
move
again
amongst
one
in
a
sort
of
frenzy
then
he
wrenched
himself
free
from
the
detaining
hand
and
launched
a
retort
of
modern
science
against
the
challenge
of
ancient
sorcery
raising
his
browning
pistol
he
fired
shot
after
shot
at
that
shape
which
stood
between
himself
and
the
tripod
a
thousand
frightful
echoes
filled
the
chamber
with
a
demon
mockery
boomed
along
those
subterranean
passages
beneath
and
bore
the
conflict
of
sound
into
the
hidden
places
of
the
pyramid
which
had
known
not
sound
for
untold
generations
my
god
vaguely
he
became
aware
that
cairn
was
seeking
to
drag
him
away
through
a
cloud
of
smoke
he
saw
the
figure
turn
dream
fashion
he
saw
the
pallid
glistening
face
of
antony
ferrara
the
long
evil
eyes
alight
like
the
eyes
of
a
serpent
were
fixed
upon
him
he
seemed
to
stand
amid
a
chaos
in
a
mad
world
beyond
the
borders
of
reason
beyond
the
dominions
of
god
but
to
his
stupefied
mind
one
astounding
fact
found
access
he
had
fired
at
least
seven
shots
at
the
figure
and
it
was
not
humanly
possible
that
all
could
have
gone
wide
of
their
mark
yet
antony
ferrara
lived
utter
darkness
blotted
out
the
evil
vision
then
there
was
a
white
light
ahead
and
feeling
that
he
was
struggling
for
sanity
sime
managed
to
realise
that
cairn
retreating
along
the
passage
was
crying
to
him
in
a
voice
rising
almost
to
a
shriek
to
run
run
for
his
life
for
his
salvation
should
not
have
he
seemed
to
hear
unconscious
of
any
contact
with
the
stones
although
afterwards
he
found
his
knees
and
shins
to
be
bleeding
he
was
scrambling
down
that
long
sloping
shaft
he
had
a
vague
impression
that
cairn
descending
beneath
him
sometimes
grasped
his
ankles
and
placed
his
feet
into
the
footholes
a
continuous
roaring
sound
filled
his
ears
as
if
a
great
ocean
were
casting
its
storm
waves
against
the
structure
around
him
the
place
seemed
to
rock
down
flat
some
sense
of
reality
was
returning
to
him
now
he
perceived
that
cairn
was
urging
him
to
crawl
back
along
the
short
passage
by
which
they
had
entered
from
the
king
chamber
heedless
of
hurt
he
threw
himself
down
and
pressed
on
a
blank
like
the
sleep
of
exhaustion
which
follows
delirium
came
then
sime
found
himself
standing
in
the
king
chamber
cairn
who
held
an
electric
lamp
in
his
hand
beside
him
and
half
supporting
him
the
realities
suddenly
reasserting
themselves
i
have
dropped
my
pistol
muttered
sime
he
threw
off
the
supporting
arm
and
turned
to
that
corner
behind
the
heap
of
where
was
the
opening
through
which
they
had
entered
the
satanic
temple
no
opening
was
visible
he
has
closed
it
cried
cairn
there
are
six
stone
doors
between
here
and
the
place
above
if
he
had
succeeded
in
shutting
of
them
before
we
my
god
whispered
sime
let
us
get
out
i
am
nearly
at
the
end
of
my
tether
fear
lends
wings
and
it
was
with
something
like
the
lightness
of
a
bird
that
sime
descended
the
shaft
at
the
bottom
on
to
my
shoulders
he
cried
looking
up
cairn
lowered
himself
to
the
foot
of
the
shaft
you
go
first
he
said
he
was
gasping
as
if
nearly
suffocated
but
retained
a
wonderful
once
over
into
the
borderland
and
bravery
assumes
a
new
guise
the
courage
which
can
face
physical
danger
undaunted
melts
in
the
fires
of
the
unknown
sime
his
breath
whistling
sibilantly
between
his
clenched
teeth
hauled
himself
through
the
low
passage
with
incredible
speed
the
two
worked
their
way
arduously
up
the
long
slope
they
saw
the
blue
sky
above
them
something
like
a
huge
bat
said
robert
cairn
crawled
out
upon
the
first

we
both

cairn
raised
his
hand
he
lay
exhausted
at
the
foot
of
the
mound
he
had
lighted
the
incense
he
replied
and
was
reciting
the
secret
ritual

can
not

were

the
incense
to
robert
cairn
it
seemed
that
the
would
never
reach
charing
cross
his
restlessness
was
appalling
he
perpetually
glanced
from
his
father
with
whom
he
shared
the
compartment
to
the
flying
landscape
with
its
vistas
of
and
cairn
although
he
exhibited
less
anxiety
was
nevertheless
strung
to
highest
tension
that
dash
from
cairo
homeward
had
been
something
of
a
fevered
dream
to
both
men
to
learn
whilst
one
is
searching
for
a
malign
and
implacable
enemy
in
egypt
that
that
enemy
having
secretly
returned
to
london
is
weaving
his
evil
spells
around
some
we
loved
the
loveliest
and
the
best
is
to
know
the
meaning
of
ordeal
in
pursuit
of
antony
ferrara
the
incarnation
of
an
awful
evil
cairn
had
deserted
his
practice
had
left
england
for
egypt
now
he
was
hurrying
back
again
for
whilst
he
had
sought
in
strange
and
dark
places
of
that
land
of
mystery
for
antony
ferrara
the
latter
had
been
darkly
active
in
london
again
and
again
robert
cairn
read
the
letter
which
surely
as
a
royal
command
had
recalled
them
it
was
from
myra
duquesne
one
line
in
it
had
fallen
upon
them
like
a
bomb
had
altered
all
their
plans
had
shattered
the
one
fragment
of
peace
remaining
to
them
in
the
eyes
of
robert
cairn
the
whole
universe
centred
around
myra
duquesne
she
was
the
one
being
in
the
world
of
whom
he
could
not
bear
to
think
in
conjunction
with
antony
ferrara
now
he
knew
that
antony
ferrara
was
beside
her
was
doubtless
at
this
very
moment
directing
those
black
arts
of
which
he
was
master
to
the
destruction
of
her
mind
and
body
perhaps
of
her
very
soul
again
he
drew
the
worn
envelope
from
his
pocket
and
read
that
ominous
sentence
which
when
his
eyes
had
first
fallen
upon
it
had
blotted
out
the
sunlight
of
egypt
and
you
will
be
surprised
to
hear
that
antony
is
back
in
london
and
is
a
frequent
visitor
here
it
is
quite
like
old
times
raising
his
haggard
eyes
robert
cairn
saw
that
his
father
was
watching
him
keep
calm
my
boy
urged
the
doctor
it
can
profit
us
nothing
it
can
profit

nothing
for
you
to
shatter
your
nerves
at
a
time
when
real
trials
are
before
you
you
are
inviting
another
breakdown
oh
i
know
it
is
hard
but
for
everybody
sake
try
to
keep
yourself
in
hand
i
am
trying
sir
replied
robert
hollowly
cairn
nodded
drumming
his
fingers
upon
his
knee
we
must
be
diplomatic
he
continued
that
james
saunderson
proposed
to
return
to
london
i
had
no
idea
i
thought
that
myra
would
be
far
outside
the
black
maelstr√∂m
in
scotland
had
i
suspected
that
saunderson
would
come
to
london
i
should
have
made
other
arrangements
of
course
sir
i
know
that
but
even
so
we
could
never
have
foreseen
this
cairn
shook
his
head
to
think
that
whilst
we
have
been
scouring
egypt
from
port
said
to
assouan
has
been
laughing
at
us
in
london
he
said
directly
after
the
affair
at
m√©yd√ªm
he
must
have
left
the
country
how
heaven
only
knows
that
letter
is
three
weeks
old
now
robert
cairn
nodded
what
may
have
happened
since
what
may
have
happened
you
take
too
gloomy
a
view
james
saunderson
is
a
roman
guardian
even
antony
ferrara
could
make
little
headway
there
but
myra
says
that
ferrara
is
a
frequent
visitor
and
saunderson
replied
cairn
with
a
grim
smile
is
a
scotchman
rely
upon
his
diplomacy
rob
myra
will
be
safe
enough
god
grant
that
she
is
at
that
silence
fell
between
them
until
punctually
to
time
the
train
slowed
into
charing
cross
inspired
by
a
common
anxiety
cairn
and
his
son
were
first
among
the
passengers
to
pass
the
barrier
the
car
was
waiting
for
them
and
within
five
minutes
of
the
arrival
of
the
train
they
were
whirling
through
london
traffic
to
the
house
of
james
saunderson
it
lay
in
that
quaint
backwater
remote
from
dulwich
common
and
was
a
rambling
building
which
at
some
time
had
been
a
farmhouse
as
the
big
car
pulled
up
at
the
gate
saunderson
a
scotchman
and
with
his
grey
hair
worn
long
and
untidily
came
out
to
meet
them
myra
duquesne
stood
beside
him
a
quick
blush
coloured
her
face
momentarily
then
left
it
pale
again
indeed
her
pallor
was
alarming
as
robert
cairn
leaping
from
the
car
seized
both
her
hands
and
looked
into
her
eyes
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
girl
had
almost
an
ethereal
appearance
something
clutched
at
his
heart
iced
his
blood
for
myra
duquesne
seemed
a
creature
scarcely
belonging
to
the
world
of
humanity
seemed
already
half
a
spirit
the
light
in
her
sweet
eyes
was
good
to
see
but
her
fragility
and
a
certain
transparency
of
complexion
horrified
him
yet
he
knew
that
he
must
hide
these
fears
from
her
and
turning
to
saunderson
he
shook
him
warmly
by
the
hand
and
the
party
of
four
passed
by
the
low
porch
into
the
house
in
the
miss
saunderson
a
typical
scottish
housekeeper
stood
beaming
welcome
but
in
the
very
instant
of
greeting
her
robert
cairn
stopped
suddenly
as
if
transfixed
cairn
also
pulled
up
just
within
the
door
his
nostrils
quivering
and
his
clear
grey
eyes
turning
right
and
left
searching
the
shadows
miss
saunderson
detected
this
sudden
restraint
is
anything
the
matter
she
asked
anxiously
myra
standing
beside
saunderson
began
to
look
frightened
but
cairn
shaking
off
the
incubus
which
had
descended
upon
him
forced
a
laugh
and
clapping
his
hand
upon
robert
shoulder
cried
wake
up
my
boy
i
know
it
is
good
to
be
back
in
england
again
but
keep
your
for
after
lunch
robert
cairn
forced
a
ghostly
smile
in
return
and
the
odd
incident
promised
soon
to
be
forgotten
how
good
of
you
said
myra
as
the
party
entered
the
to
come
right
from
the
station
to
see
us
and
you
must
be
expected
in
street
dr
cairn
of
course
we
came
to
see
first
replied
robert
cairn
significantly
myra
lowered
her
face
and
pursued
that
subject
no
further
no
mention
was
made
of
antony
ferrara
and
neither
cairn
nor
his
son
cared
to
broach
the
subject
the
lunch
passed
off
then
without
any
reference
to
the
very
matter
which
had
brought
them
there
that
day
it
was
not
until
nearly
an
hour
later
that
cairn
and
his
son
found
themselves
alone
for
a
moment
then
with
a
furtive
glance
about
him
the
doctor
spoke
of
that
which
had
occupied
his
mind
to
the
exclusion
of
all
else
since
first
they
had
entered
the
house
of
james
saunderson
you
noticed
it
rob
he
whispered
my
god
it
nearly
choked
me
cairn
nodded
grimly
it
is
all
over
the
house
he
continued
in
every
room
that
i
have
entered
they
are
used
to
it
and
evidently
do
not
notice
it
but
coming
in
from
the
clean
air
it
is
abominable
unclean
unholy
we
know
it
continued
cairn
softly
that
smell
of
unholiness
we
have
good
reason
to
know
it
it
heralded
the
death
of
sir
michael
ferrara
it
heralded
the
death
of
another
with
a
just
god
in
heaven
can
such
things
be
it
is
the
secret
incense
of
ancient
egypt
whispered
cairn
glancing
towards
the
open
door
it
is
the
odour
of
that
black
magic
which
by
all
natural
law
should
be
buried
and
lost
for
ever
in
the
tombs
of
the
ancient
wizards
only
two
living
men
within
my
knowledge
know
the
use
and
the
hidden
meaning
of
that
perfume
only
one
living
man
has
ever
dared
to
make
it
to
use
it
antony
ferrara
we
knew
he
was
here
boy
now
we
know
that
he
is
using
his
powers
here
something
tells
me
that
we
come
to
the
end
of
the
fight
may
victory
be
with
the
just
chapter
xxi
the
magician
street
was
bathed
in
tropical
sunlight
cairn
with
his
hands
behind
him
stood
looking
out
of
the
window
he
turned
to
his
son
who
leant
against
a
corner
of
the
bookcase
in
the
shadows
of
the
big
room
hot
enough
for
egypt
rob
he
said
robert
cairn
nodded
antony
ferrara
he
replied
seemingly
travels
his
own
atmosphere
with
him
i
first
became
acquainted
with
his
hellish
activities
during
a
phenomenal
thunderstorm
in
egypt
his
movements
apparently
corresponded
with
those
of
the
now
he
waved
his
hand
vaguely
towards
the
window
this
is
egypt
in
london
egypt
is
in
london
indeed
muttered
cairn
jermyn
has
decided
that
our
fears
are
you
mean
sir
that
the
will
antony
ferrara
would
have
an
almost
unassailable
case
in
the
event
of
of
myra
you
mean
that
her
share
of
the
legacy
would
fall
to
that
fiend
if
she
if
she
died
exactly
robert
cairn
began
to
stride
up
and
down
the
room
clenching
and
unclenching
his
fists
he
was
a
shadow
of
his
former
self
but
now
his
cheeks
were
flushed
and
his
eyes
feverishly
bright
before
heaven
he
cried
suddenly
the
situation
is
becoming
unbearable
a
thing
more
deadly
than
the
plague
is
abroad
here
in
london
apart
from
the
personal
aspect
of
the
matter
of
which
i
dare
not
think
what
do
we
know
of
ferrara
activities
his
record
is
damnable
to
our
certain
knowledge
his
victims
are
many
if
the
murder
of
his
adoptive
father
sir
michael
was
actually
the
first
of
his
crimes
we
know
of
three
other
poor
souls
who
beyond
any
shadow
of
doubt
were
launched
into
eternity
by
the
black
arts
of
this
ghastly
villain
we
do
rob
replied
cairn
sternly
he
has
made
attempts
upon
you
he
has
made
attempts
upon
me
we
owe
our
survival
he
pointed
to
a
row
of
books
upon
a
corner
shelf
to
the
knowledge
which
you
have
accumulated
in
half
a
of
research
in
the
face
of
science
in
the
face
of
modern
scepticism
in
the
face
of
our
belief
in
a
benign
god
this
creature
antony
ferrara
has
proved
himself
conclusively
to
be
he
is
what
the
benighted
ancients
called
a
magician
interrupted
cairn
quietly
he
is
what
was
known
in
the
middle
ages
as
a
wizard
what
that
means
exactly
few
modern
thinkers
know
but
i
know
and
one
day
others
will
know
meanwhile
his
shadow
lies
upon
a
certain
house
robert
cairn
shook
his
clenched
fists
in
the
air
in
some
men
the
gesture
had
seemed
melodramatic
in
him
it
was
the
expression
of
a
soul
agony
but
sir
he
cried
are
we
to
wait
inert
helpless
whatever
he
is
he
has
a
human
body
and
there
are
bullets
there
are
knives
there
are
a
hundred
drugs
in
the
british
pharmacopoeia
quite
so
answered
cairn
watching
his
son
closely
and
by
his
own
collected
manner
endeavouring
to
check
the
other
growing
excitement
i
am
prepared
at
any
personal
risk
to
crush
antony
ferrara
as
i
would
crush
a
scorpion
but
where
is
he
robert
cairn
groaned
dropping
into
the
big
armchair
and
burying
his
face
in
his
hands
our
position
is
maddening
continued
the
elder
man
we
know
that
antony
ferrara
visits
saunderson
house
we
know
that
he
is
laughing
at
our
vain
attempts
to
trap
him
crowning
comedy
of
all
saunderson
does
not
know
the
truth
he
is
not
the
type
of
man
who
could
ever
understand
in
fact
we
dare
not
tell
him
and
we
dare
not
tell
myra
the
result
is
that
those
whom
we
would
protect
unwittingly
are
working
against
us
and
against
themselves
that
perfume
burst
out
robert
cairn
that
hell
incense
which
loads
the
atmosphere
of
saunderson
house
to
think
that
we
know
what
it
means
that
we
know
what
it
means
perhaps
know
even
better
than
you
do
rob
the
occult
uses
of
perfume
are
not
understood
nowadays
but
you
from
experience
know
that
certain
perfumes
have
occult
uses
at
the
pyramid
of
m√©yd√ªm
in
egypt
antony
ferrara
dared
and
the
just
god
did
not
strike
him
dead
to
make
a
certain
incense
it
was
often
made
in
the
remote
past
and
a
portion
of
it
probably
in
a
jar
hermetically
sealed
had
come
into
his
possession
i
once
detected
its
dreadful
odour
in
his
rooms
in
london
had
you
asked
me
prior
to
that
occasion
if
any
of
the
hellish
stuff
had
survived
to
the
present
day
i
should
most
emphatically
have
said
i
should
have
been
wrong
ferrara
had
some
he
used
it
all
and
went
to
the
m√©yd√ªm
pyramid
to
renew
his
stock
robert
cairn
was
listening
intently
all
this
brings
me
back
to
a
point
which
i
have
touched
upon
before
sir
he
said
to
my
certain
knowledge
the
late
sir
michael
and
yourself
have
delved
into
the
black
mysteries
of
egypt
more
deeply
than
any
men
of
the
present
century
yet
antony
ferrara
little
more
than
a
boy
has
mastered
secrets
which
you
after
years
of
research
have
failed
to
grasp
what
does
this
mean
sir
cairn
again
locking
his
hands
behind
him
stared
out
of
the
window
he
is
not
an
ordinary
mortal
continued
his
son
he
is
supernormal
and
supernaturally
wicked
you
have
admitted
indeed
it
was
evident
that
he
is
merely
the
adopted
son
of
the
late
sir
michael
now
that
we
have
entered
upon
the
final
struggle
for
i
feel
that
this
is
so
i
will
ask
you
again
is
antony
cairn
spun
around
upon
the
speaker
his
grey
eyes
were
very
bright
there
is
one
little
obstacle
he
answered
which
has
deterred
me
from
telling
you
what
you
have
asked
so
often
although
and
you
have
had
dreadful
opportunities
to
peer
behind
the
veil
you
will
find
it
hard
to
believe
i
hope
very
shortly
to
be
able
to
answer
that
question
and
to
tell
you
who
antony
ferrara
really
is
robert
cairn
beat
his
fist
upon
the
arm
of
the
chair
i
sometimes
wonder
he
said
that
either
of
us
has
remained
sane
oh
what
does
it
mean
what
can
we
do
what
can
we
do
we
must
watch
rob
to
enlist
the
services
of
saunderson
would
be
almost
impossible
he
lives
in
his
orchid
houses
they
are
his
world
in
matters
of
ordinary
life
i
can
trust
him
above
most
men
but
in
this
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
could
we
suggest
to
him
a
reason
any
reason
but
the
real
one
why
he
should
refuse
to
receive
ferrara
it
might
destroy
our
last
chance
but
sir
cried
robert
wildly
it
amounts
to
this
we
are
using
myra
as
a
lure
in
order
to
save
her
rob
simply
in
order
to
save
her
retorted
cairn
sternly
how
ill
she
looks
groaned
the
other
how
pale
and
worn
there
are
great
shadows
under
her
eyes
oh
i
can
not
bear
to
think
about
her
when
was
last
there
apparently
some
ten
days
ago
you
may
depend
upon
him
to
be
aware
of
our
return
he
will
not
come
there
again
sir
but
there
are
other
ways
in
which
he
might
reach
her
does
he
not
command
a
whole
shadow
army
and
saunderson
is
entirely
unsuspicious
and
myra
thinks
of
the
fiend
as
a
brother
yet
she
has
never
once
spoken
of
him
i
wonder
cairn
sat
deep
in
reflection
suddenly
he
took
out
his
watch
go
around
now
he
said
you
will
be
in
time
for
lunch
and
remain
there
until
i
come
from
onward
although
actually
your
health
does
not
permit
of
the
strain
we
must
watch
watch
night
and
day
chapter
xxii
myra
myra
duquesne
came
under
an
arch
of
roses
to
the
wooden
seat
where
robert
cairn
awaited
her
in
her
plain
white
linen
frock
with
the
sun
in
her
hair
and
her
eyes
looking
unnaturally
large
owing
to
the
pallor
of
her
beautiful
face
she
seemed
to
the
man
who
rose
to
greet
her
an
ethereal
creature
but
lightly
linked
to
the
flesh
and
blood
world
an
impulse
which
had
possessed
him
often
enough
before
but
which
hitherto
he
had
suppressed
suddenly
possessed
him
anew
set
his
heart
beating
and
filled
his
veins
with
fire
as
a
soft
blush
spread
over
the
girl
pale
cheeks
and
with
a
sort
of
timidity
she
held
out
her
hand
he
leapt
to
his
feet
threw
his
arms
around
her
and
kissed
her
kissed
her
eyes
her
hair
her
lips
there
was
a
moment
of
frightened
hesitancy
and
then
she
had
resigned
herself
to
this
sort
of
savage
tenderness
which
was
better
in
its
very
brutality
than
any
caress
she
had
ever
known
which
thrilled
her
with
a
glorious
joy
such
as
she
realised
now
she
had
dreamt
of
and
lacked
and
wanted
which
was
a
harbourage
to
which
she
came
blushing
confused
but
glad
conquered
and
happy
in
the
thrall
of
that
exquisite
slavery
myra
he
whispered
myra
have
i
frightened
you
will
you
forgive
me
she
nodded
her
head
quickly
and
nestled
upon
his
shoulder
i
could
wait
no
longer
he
murmured
in
her
ear
words
seemed
unnecessary
i
just
wanted
you
you
are
everything
in
the
world
and
he
concluded
simply
i
took
you
she
whispered
his
name
very
softly
what
a
serenity
there
is
in
such
a
moment
what
a
glow
of
secure
happiness
of
immunity
from
the
pains
and
sorrows
of
the
world
robert
cairn
his
arms
about
this
girl
who
from
his
early
boyhood
had
been
his
ideal
of
womanhood
of
love
and
of
all
that
love
meant
forgot
those
things
which
had
shaken
his
life
and
brought
him
to
the
threshold
of
death
forgot
those
evidences
of
illness
which
marred
the
once
glorious
beauty
of
the
girl
forgot
the
black
menace
of
the
future
forgot
the
wizard
enemy
whose
hand
was
stretched
over
that
house
and
that
garden
and
was
merely
happy
but
this
paroxysm
of
gladness
which
eliphas
l√©vi
last
of
the
adepts
has
so
marvellously
analysed
in
one
of
his
works
is
of
short
duration
as
are
all
joys
it
is
needless
to
recount
here
the
broken
sentences
punctuated
with
those
first
kisses
which
sweeten
the
memory
of
old
age
that
now
passed
for
conversation
and
which
lovers
have
believed
to
be
conversation
since
the
world
began
as
dusk
creeps
over
a
glorious
landscape
so
the
shadow
of
antony
ferrara
crept
over
the
happiness
of
these
two
gradually
that
shadow
fell
between
them
and
the
sun
the
grim
thing
which
loomed
big
in
the
lives
of
them
both
refused
any
longer
to
be
ignored
robert
cairn
his
arm
about
the
girl
waist
broached
the
hated
subject
when
did
you
last
see
ferrara
myra
looked
up
suddenly
over
a
week
nearly
a
fortnight
ago
ah
cairn
noted
that
the
girl
spoke
of
ferrara
with
an
odd
sort
of
restraint
for
which
he
was
at
a
loss
to
account
myra
had
always
regarded
her
guardian
adopted
son
in
the
light
of
a
brother
therefore
her
present
attitude
was
all
the
more
singular
you
did
not
expect
him
to
return
to
england
so
soon
he
asked
i
had
no
idea
that
he
was
in
england
said
myra
until
he
walked
in
here
one
day
i
was
glad
to
see
him
then
and
should
you
not
be
glad
to
see
him
now
inquired
cairn
eagerly
myra
her
head
lowered
deliberately
pressed
out
a
crease
in
her
white
skirt
one
day
last
week
she
replied
slowly
he
came
here
and
acted
strangely
in
what
way
jerked
cairn
he
pointed
out
to
me
that
actually
we
he
and
i
were
in
no
way
related
well
you
know
how
i
have
always
liked
antony
i
have
always
thought
of
him
as
my
brother
again
she
hesitated
and
a
troubled
expression
crept
over
her
pale
face
cairn
raised
his
arm
and
clasped
it
about
her
shoulders
tell
me
all
about
it
he
whispered
reassuringly
well
continued
myra
in
evident
confusion
his
behaviour
became
embarrassing
and
suddenly
he
asked
me
if
i
could
ever
love
him
not
as
a
brother
but
i
understand
said
cairn
grimly
and
you
replied
for
some
time
i
could
not
reply
at
all
i
was
so
surprised
and
so
horrified
i
can
not
explain
how
i
felt
about
it
but
it
seemed
horrible
it
seemed
horrible
but
of
course
you
told
him
i
told
him
that
i
could
never
be
fond
of
him
in
any
different
way
that
i
could
never
of
it
and
although
i
endeavoured
to
avoid
hurting
his
feelings
he
took
it
very
badly
he
said
in
such
a
queer
choking
voice
that
he
was
going
away
away
from
england
yes
and
he
made
a
strange
request
what
was
it
in
the
circumstances
you
see
i
felt
sorry
for
him
i
did
not
like
to
refuse
him
it
was
only
a
trifling
thing
he
asked
for
a
lock
of
my
hair
a
lock
of
your
hair
and
you
i
told
you
that
i
did
not
like
to
refuse
and
i
let
him
snip
off
a
tiny
piece
with
a
pair
of
pocket
scissors
which
he
had
are
you
angry
of
course
not
you
were
almost
brought
up
together
you
then
she
paused
he
seemed
to
change
suddenly
i
found
myself
afraid
dreadfully
afraid
of
ferrara
not
of
antony
exactly
but
what
is
the
good
of
my
trying
to
explain
a
most
awful
dread
seized
me
his
face
was
no
longer
the
face
that
i
have
always
known
something
her
voice
trembled
and
she
seemed
disposed
to
leave
the
sentence
unfinished
then
something
evil
sinister
had
come
into
it
and
since
then
said
cairn
you
have
not
seen
him
he
has
not
been
here
since
then
no
cairn
his
hands
resting
upon
the
girl
shoulders
leant
back
in
the
seat
and
looked
into
her
troubled
eyes
with
a
kind
of
sad
scrutiny
you
have
not
been
fretting
about
him
myra
shook
her
head
yet
you
look
as
though
something
were
troubling
you
this
house
he
indicated
the
garden
with
a
certain
irritation
is
not
healthily
situated
this
place
lies
in
a
valley
look
at
the
rank
grass
and
there
are
mosquitoes
everywhere
you
do
not
look
well
myra
the
girl
smiled
a
little
wistful
smile
but
i
was
so
tired
of
scotland
she
said
you
do
not
know
how
i
looked
forward
to
london
again
i
must
admit
though
that
i
was
in
better
health
there
i
was
quite
ashamed
of
my
appearance
you
have
nothing
to
amuse
you
here
said
cairn
tenderly
no
company
for
saunderson
only
lives
for
his
orchids
they
are
very
fascinating
said
myra
dreamily
i
too
have
felt
their
glamour
i
am
the
only
member
of
the
household
whom
he
allows
amongst
his
orchids
perhaps
you
spend
too
much
time
there
interrupted
cairn
that
superheated
artificial
atmosphere
myra
shook
her
head
playfully
patting
his
arm
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
the
matter
with
me
she
said
almost
in
her
old
bright
manner
now
that
you
are
back
i
do
not
approve
of
orchids
jerked
cairn
doggedly
they
are
parodies
of
what
a
flower
should
be
place
an
odontoglossum
beside
a
rose
and
what
a
distorted
unholy
thing
it
looks
unholy
laughed
myra
unholy
yes
they
are
products
of
feverish
swamps
and
deathly
jungles
i
hate
orchids
the
atmosphere
of
an
can
not
possibly
be
clean
and
healthy
one
might
as
well
spend
one
time
in
a
bacteriological
laboratory
myra
shook
her
head
with
affected
seriousness
you
must
not
let
saunderson
hear
you
she
said
his
orchids
are
his
children
their
very
mystery
enthrals
him
and
really
it
is
most
fascinating
to
look
at
one
of
those
shapeless
bulbs
and
to
speculate
upon
what
kind
of
bloom
it
will
produce
is
almost
as
thrilling
as
reading
a
sensational
novel
he
has
one
growing
now
it
will
bloom
some
time
this
week
about
which
he
is
frantically
excited
where
did
he
get
it
asked
cairn
without
interest
he
bought
it
from
a
man
who
had
almost
certainly
stolen
it
there
were
six
bulbs
in
the
parcel
only
two
have
lived
and
one
of
these
is
much
more
advanced
than
the
other
it
is
high
she
held
out
her
hand
indicating
a
height
of
some
three
feet
from
the
ground
it
has
not
flowered
yet
no
but
the
buds
huge
smooth
things
seem
on
the
point
of
bursting
at
any
moment
we
call
it
the
and
it
is
my
special
care
saunderson
has
shown
me
how
to
attend
to
its
simple
needs
and
if
it
proves
to
be
a
new
species
which
is
almost
certain
he
is
going
to
exhibit
it
and
name
it
after
me
shall
you
be
proud
of
having
an
orchid
named
after
after
my
wife
cairn
concluded
seizing
her
hands
i
could
never
be
more
proud
of
you
than
i
am
already
chapter
xxiii
the
face
in
the
cairn
walked
to
the
window
with
its
leaded
panes
a
lamp
stood
by
the
bedside
and
he
had
tilted
the
shade
so
that
it
shone
upon
the
pale
face
of
the
patient
myra
duquesne
two
days
had
wrought
a
dreadful
change
in
her
she
lay
with
closed
eyes
and
sunken
face
upon
which
ominous
shadows
played
her
respiration
was
imperceptible
the
reputation
of
bruce
cairn
was
a
well
deserved
one
but
this
case
puzzled
him
he
knew
that
myra
duquesne
was
dying
before
his
eyes
he
could
still
see
the
agonised
face
of
his
son
robert
who
at
that
moment
was
waiting
filled
with
intolerable
suspense
downstairs
in
saunderson
study
but
withal
he
was
helpless
he
looked
out
from
the
casement
across
the
shrubbery
to
where
the
moonlight
glittered
among
the
trees
those
were
the
and
with
his
back
to
the
bed
cairn
stood
for
long
thoughtfully
watching
the
distant
gleams
of
reflected
light
craig
fenton
and
sir
elwin
groves
with
whom
he
had
been
consulting
were
but
just
gone
the
nature
of
myra
duquesne
illness
had
utterly
puzzled
them
and
they
had
left
mystified
downstairs
robert
cairn
was
pacing
the
study
wondering
if
his
reason
would
survive
this
final
blow
which
threatened
he
knew
and
his
father
knew
that
a
sinister
something
underlay
this
strange
illness
an
illness
which
had
commenced
on
the
day
that
antony
ferrara
had
last
visited
the
house
the
evening
was
insufferably
hot
not
a
breeze
stirred
in
the
leaves
and
despite
open
windows
the
air
of
the
room
was
heavy
and
lifeless
a
faint
perfume
having
a
sort
of
sweetness
but
which
yet
was
unutterably
revolting
made
itself
perceptible
to
the
nostrils
apparently
it
had
pervaded
the
house
by
slow
degrees
the
occupants
were
so
used
to
it
that
they
did
not
notice
it
at
all
cairn
had
busied
himself
that
evening
in
the
burning
some
pungent
preparation
to
the
amazement
of
the
nurse
and
of
the
consultants
now
the
biting
fumes
of
his
pastilles
had
all
been
wafted
out
of
the
window
and
the
faint
sweet
smell
was
as
noticeable
as
ever
not
a
sound
broke
the
silence
of
the
house
and
when
the
nurse
quietly
opened
the
door
and
entered
cairn
was
still
standing
staring
thoughtfully
out
of
the
window
in
the
direction
of
the
he
turned
and
walking
back
to
the
bedside
bent
over
the
patient
her
face
was
like
a
white
mask
she
was
quite
unconscious
and
so
far
as
he
could
see
showed
no
change
either
for
better
or
worse
but
her
pulse
was
slightly
more
feeble
and
the
doctor
suppressed
a
groan
of
despair
for
this
mysterious
progressive
weakness
could
only
have
one
end
all
his
experience
told
him
that
unless
something
could
be
done
and
every
expedient
thus
far
attempted
had
proved
futile
myra
duquesne
would
die
about
dawn
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
strode
from
the
room
whispering
a
few
words
of
instruction
to
the
nurse
descending
the
stairs
he
passed
the
closed
study
door
not
daring
to
think
of
his
son
who
waited
within
and
entered
the
a
single
lamp
burnt
there
and
the
gaunt
figure
of
saunderson
was
outlined
dimly
where
he
sat
in
the
window
seat
crombie
the
gardener
stood
by
the
table
now
crombie
said
cairn
quietly
closing
the
door
behind
him
what
is
this
story
about
the
and
why
did
you
not
mention
it
before
the
man
stared
persistently
into
the
shadows
of
the
room
avoiding
cairn
glance
since
he
has
had
the
courage
to
own
up
interrupted
saunderson
i
have
overlooked
the
matter
but
he
was
afraid
to
speak
before
because
he
had
no
business
to
be
in
the
his
voice
grew
suddenly
fierce
he
knows
it
well
enough
i
know
sir
that
you
do
want
me
to
interfere
with
the
orchids
replied
the
man
but
i
only
ventured
in
because
i
thought
i
saw
a
light
moving
there
rubbish
snapped
saunderson
pardon
me
saunderson
said
cairn
but
a
matter
of
more
importance
than
the
welfare
of
all
the
orchids
in
the
world
is
under
consideration
now
saunderson
coughed
dryly
you
are
right
cairn
he
said
i
should
have
lost
my
temper
for
such
a
trifle
at
a
time
like
this
tell
your
own
tale
crombie
i
wo
interrupt
it
was
last
night
then
continued
the
man
i
was
standing
at
the
door
of
my
cottage
smoking
a
pipe
before
turning
in
when
i
saw
a
faint
light
moving
over
by
the
reflection
of
the
moon
muttered
saunderson
i
am
sorry
go
on
crombie
i
knew
that
some
of
the
orchids
were
very
valuable
and
i
thought
there
would
not
be
time
to
call
you
also
i
did
not
want
to
worry
you
knowing
you
had
worry
enough
already
so
i
knocked
out
my
pipe
and
put
it
in
my
pocket
and
went
through
the
shrubbery
i
saw
the
light
again
it
seemed
to
be
moving
from
the
first
house
into
the
second
i
could
see
what
it
was
was
it
like
a
candle
or
a
jerked
cairn
nothing
like
that
sir
a
softer
light
more
like
a
but
much
brighter
i
went
around
and
tried
the
door
and
it
was
locked
then
i
remembered
the
door
at
the
other
end
and
i
cut
round
by
the
path
between
the
houses
and
the
wall
so
that
i
had
no
chance
to
see
the
light
again
until
i
got
to
the
other
door
i
found
this
unlocked
there
was
a
close
kind
of
smell
in
there
sir
and
the
air
was
very
hot
naturally
it
was
hot
interrupted
saunderson
i
mean
much
hotter
than
it
should
have
been
it
was
like
an
oven
and
the
smell
was
stifling
what
smell
asked
cairn
can
you
describe
it
excuse
me
sir
but
i
seem
to
notice
it
here
in
this
room
and
i
think
i
noticed
it
about
the
place
before
never
so
strong
as
in
the
go
on
said
cairn
i
went
through
the
first
house
and
saw
nothing
the
shadow
of
the
wall
prevented
the
moonlight
from
shining
in
there
but
just
as
i
was
about
to
enter
the
middle
house
i
thought
i
saw
a
face
what
do
you
mean
you
you
saw
snapped
saunderson
i
mean
sir
that
it
was
so
horrible
and
so
strange
that
i
could
not
believe
it
was
real
which
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
i
did
not
speak
before
it
reminded
me
of
the
face
of
a
gentleman
i
have
seen
here
ferrara
cairn
stifled
an
exclamation
but
in
other
ways
it
was
quite
unlike
the
gentleman
in
some
ways
it
was
more
like
the
face
of
a
woman
a
very
bad
woman
it
had
a
sort
of
bluish
light
on
it
but
where
it
could
have
come
from
i
do
know
it
seemed
to
be
smiling
and
two
bright
eyes
looked
straight
out
at
me
crombie
stopped
raising
his
hand
to
his
head
confusedly
i
could
see
nothing
but
just
this
face
low
down
as
if
the
person
it
belonged
to
was
crouching
on
the
floor
and
there
was
a
tall
plant
of
some
kind
just
beside
it
well
said
cairn
go
on
what
did
you
do
i
turned
to
run
confessed
the
man
if
you
had
seen
that
horrible
face
you
would
understand
how
frightened
i
was
then
when
i
got
to
the
door
i
looked
back
i
hope
you
had
closed
the
door
behind
you
snapped
saunderson
never
mind
that
never
mind
that
interrupted
cairn
i
had
closed
the
door
behind
me
yes
sir
but
just
as
i
was
going
to
open
it
again
i
took
a
quick
glance
back
and
the
face
had
gone
i
came
out
and
i
was
walking
over
the
lawn
wondering
whether
i
should
tell
you
when
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
had
noticed
whether
the
key
had
been
left
in
or
not
did
you
go
back
to
see
asked
cairn
i
did
want
to
admitted
crombie
but
i
did
and
well
the
door
was
locked
sir
so
you
concluded
that
your
imagination
had
been
playing
you
tricks
said
saunderson
grimly
in
my
opinion
you
were
right
cairn
dropped
into
an
armchair
all
right
crombie
that
will
do
crombie
with
a
mumbled
gentlemen
turned
and
left
the
room
why
are
you
worrying
about
this
matter
inquired
saunderson
when
the
door
had
closed
at
a
time
like
the
present
never
mind
replied
cairn
wearily
i
must
return
to
street
now
but
i
shall
be
back
within
an
hour
with
no
other
word
to
saunderson
he
stood
up
and
walked
out
to
the
hall
he
rapped
at
the
study
door
and
it
was
instantly
opened
by
robert
cairn
no
spoken
word
was
necessary
the
burning
question
could
be
read
in
his
eyes
cairn
laid
his
hand
upon
his
shoulder
i
wo
excite
false
hopes
rob
he
said
huskily
i
am
going
back
to
the
house
and
i
want
you
to
come
with
me
robert
cairn
turned
his
head
aside
groaning
aloud
but
his
father
grasped
him
by
the
arm
and
together
they
left
that
house
of
shadows
entered
the
car
which
waited
at
the
gate
and
without
exchanging
a
word
came
to
street

flowering

led
the
way
into
the

switching
on

upon
the
large

his
son
stood
just
within
the
doorway
his
arms
folded
and

the

sat
down

voice
was
barely
audible
that
her
illness
can
in
any
way
be
due
to
the
orchids
cairn
frowned
thoughtfully
what
do
you
mean
exactly
he
asked
orchids
are
mysterious
things
they
come
from
places
where
there
are
strange
and
dreadful
diseases
is
it
not
possible
that
they
may
convey
some
sort
of
contagion
concluded
cairn
it
is
a
point
that
i
have
seen
raised
certainly
but
nothing
of
the
sort
has
ever
been
established
i
have
heard
something
though
which
what
have
you
heard
sir
asked
his
son
eagerly
stepping
forward
to
the
table
never
mind
at
the
moment
rob
let
me
think
he
rested
his
elbow
upon
the
table
and
his
chin
in
his
hand
his
professional
instincts
had
told
him
that
unless
something
could
be
done
something
which
the
highest
medical
skill
in
london
had
thus
far
been
unable
to
devise
myra
duquesne
had
but
four
hours
to
live
somewhere
in
his
mind
a
memory
lurked
evasive
taunting
him
this
wild
suggestion
of
his
son
that
the
girl
illness
might
be
due
in
some
way
to
her
contact
with
the
orchids
was
in
part
responsible
for
this
confused
memory
but
it
seemed
to
be
associated
too
with
the
story
of
crombie
the
gardener
and
with
antony
ferrara
he
felt
that
somewhere
in
the
darkness
surrounding
him
there
was
a
speck
of
light
if
he
could
but
turn
in
the
right
direction
to
see
it
so
whilst
robert
cairn
walked
restlessly
about
the
big
room
the
doctor
sat
with
his
chin
resting
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
seeking
to
concentrate
his
mind
upon
that
vague
memory
which
defied
him
whilst
the
hand
of
the
library
clock
crept
from
twelve
towards
one
whilst
he
knew
that
the
faint
life
in
myra
duquesne
was
slowly
ebbing
away
in
response
to
some
mysterious
condition
utterly
outside
his
experience
distant
clocks
chimed
three
hours
only
robert
cairn
began
to
beat
his
fist
into
the
palm
of
his
left
hand
convulsively
yet
his
father
did
not
stir
but
sat
there
a
wrinkle
between
his
brows
by
god
the
doctor
sprang
to
his
feet
and
with
feverish
haste
began
to
fumble
amongst
a
bunch
of
keys
what
is
it
sir
what
is
it
the
doctor
unlocked
the
drawer
of
the
big
table
and
drew
out
a
thick
manuscript
written
in
small
and
exquisitely
neat
characters
he
placed
it
under
the
lamp
and
rapidly
began
to
turn
the
pages
it
is
hope
rob
he
said
with
quiet
robert
cairn
came
round
the
table
and
leant
over
his
shoulder
sir
michael
ferrara
writing
his
unpublished
book
rob
we
were
to
have
completed
it
together
but
death
claimed
him
and
in
view
of
the
contents
i
perhaps
superstitiously
decided
to
suppress
it
ah
he
placed
the
point
of
his
finger
upon
a
carefully
drawn
sketch
designed
to
illustrate
the
text
it
was
evidently
a
careful
copy
from
the
ancient
egyptian
it
represented
a
row
of
priestesses
each
having
her
hair
plaited
in
a
thick
queue
standing
before
a
priest
armed
with
a
pair
of
scissors
in
the
centre
of
the
drawing
was
an
altar
upon
which
stood
vases
of
flowers
and
upon
the
right
ranked
a
row
of
mummies
corresponding
in
number
with
the
priestesses
upon
the
left
by
god
repeated
cairn
we
were
both
wrong
we
were
both
wrong
what
do
you
mean
sir
for
heaven
sake
what
do
you
mean
this
drawing
replied
cairn
was
copied
from
the
wall
of
a
certain
tomb
now
reclosed
since
we
knew
that
the
tomb
was
that
of
one
of
the
greatest
wizards
who
ever
lived
in
egypt
we
knew
also
that
the
inscription
had
some
magical
significance
we
knew
that
the
flowers
represented
here
were
a
species
of
the
extinct
sacred
lotus
all
our
researches
did
not
avail
us
to
discover
for
what
purpose
or
by
what
means
these
flowers
were
cultivated
nor
could
we
determine
the
meaning
of
the
cutting
off
he
ran
his
fingers
over
the
sketch
of
the
priestesses
hair
by
the
high
priest
of
the
goddess
what
goddess
sir
a
goddess
rob
of
which
egyptology
knows
nothing
a
mystical
religion
the
existence
of
which
has
been
vaguely
suspected
by
a
living
french
but
this
is
no
time
cairn
closed
the
manuscript
replaced
it
and
relocked
the
drawer
he
glanced
at
the
clock
a
quarter
past
one
he
said
come
rob
without
hesitation
his
son
followed
him
from
the
house
the
car
was
waiting
and
shortly
they
were
speeding
through
the
deserted
streets
back
to
the
house
where
death
in
a
strange
guise
was
beckoning
to
myra
duquesne
as
the
car
started
do
you
know
asked
cairn
if
saunderson
has
bought
any
orchids
recently
i
mean
yes
replied
his
son
dully
he
bought
a
small
parcel
only
a
fortnight
ago
a
fortnight
cried
cairn
excitedly
you
are
sure
of
that
you
mean
that
the
purchase
was
made
since
ferrara
ceased
to
visit
the
house
yes
why
it
must
have
been
the
very
day
after
cairn
clearly
was
labouring
under
tremendous
excitement
where
did
he
buy
these
orchids
he
asked
evenly
from
someone
who
came
to
the
house
someone
he
had
never
dealt
with
before
the
doctor
his
hands
resting
upon
his
knees
was
rapidly
drumming
with
his
fingers
and
did
he
cultivate
them
two
only
proved
successful
one
is
on
the
point
of
blooming
if
it
is
not
blooming
already
he
calls
it
the
at
that
the
doctor
excitement
overcame
him
suddenly
leaning
out
of
the
window
he
shouted
to
the
chauffeur
quicker
quicker
never
mind
risks
keep
on
top
speed
what
is
it
sir
cried
his
son
heavens
what
is
it
did
you
say
that
it
might
have
bloomed
rob
myra
robert
cairn
swallowed
noisily
told
me
three
days
ago
that
it
was
expected
to
bloom
before
the
end
of
the
week
what
is
it
like
a
thing
four
feet
high
with
huge
buds
merciful
god
grant
that
we
are
in
time
whispered
cairn
i
could
believe
once
more
in
the
justice
of
heaven
if
the
great
knowledge
of
sir
michael
ferrara
should
prove
to
be
the
weapon
to
destroy
the
fiend
whom
we
raised
he
and
i
may
we
be
forgiven
robert
cairn
excitement
was
dreadful
can
you
tell
me
nothing
he
cried
what
do
you
hope
what
do
you
fear
do
ask
me
rob
replied
his
father
you
will
know
within
five
minutes
the
car
indeed
was
leaping
along
the
dark
suburban
roads
at
a
speed
little
below
that
of
an
express
train
corners
the
chauffeur
negotiated
in
racing
fashion
so
that
at
times
two
wheels
thrashed
the
empty
air
and
once
or
twice
the
big
car
swung
round
as
upon
a
pivot
only
to
recover
again
in
response
to
the
skilled
tactics
of
the
driver
they
roared
down
the
sloping
narrow
lane
to
the
gate
of
saunderson
house
with
a
noise
like
the
coming
of
a
great
storm
and
were
nearly
hurled
from
their
seats
when
the
brakes
were
applied
and
the
car
brought
to
a
standstill
cairn
leapt
out
pushed
open
the
gate
and
ran
up
to
the
house
his
son
closely
following
there
was
a
light
in
the
hall
and
miss
saunderson
who
had
expected
them
and
had
heard
their
stormy
approach
already
held
the
door
open
in
the
hall
wait
here
one
moment
said
cairn
ignoring
saunderson
who
had
come
out
from
the
library
he
ran
upstairs
a
minute
later
his
face
very
pale
he
came
running
down
again
she
is
worse
began
saunderson
but
give
me
the
key
of
the
said
cairn
tersely
do
hesitate
do
waste
a
second
give
me
the
key
saunderson
expression
showed
that
he
thought
cairn
to
be
mad
but
nevertheless
he
plunged
his
hand
into
his
pocket
and
pulled
out
a
cairn
snatched
it
in
a
flash
which
key
he
snapped
the
chubb
but
follow
me
rob
down
the
hall
he
raced
his
son
beside
him
and
saunderson
following
more
slowly
out
into
the
garden
he
went
and
over
the
lawn
towards
the
shrubbery
the
lay
in
dense
shadow
but
the
doctor
almost
threw
himself
against
the
door
strike
a
match
he
panted
then
never
mind
i
have
it
the
door
flew
open
with
a
bang
a
sickly
perfume
swept
out
to
them

this
way
they
went
stumbling
in
robert

took
out
a
box
of
matches
and
struck
one
his
father
was
further
along
in
the
centre
building
your
knife
boy
quick
as
the
dim
light
crept
along
the
aisle
between
the
orchids
robert
cairn
saw
his
father
face
and
saw
a
vivid
green
plant
growing
in
a
sort
of
tub
before
which
the
doctor
stood
four
huge
smooth
buds
grew
upon
the
leafless
stems
two
of
them
were
on
the
point
of
opening
and
one
already
showed
a
delicious
rosy
flush
about
its
apex
cairn
grasped
the
knife
which
robert
tremblingly
offered
him
the
match
went
out
there
was
a
sound
of
hacking
a
soft
and
a
dull
thud
upon
the
tiled
floor
as
another
match
fluttered
into
brief
life
the
mysterious
orchid
severed
just
above
the
soil
fell
from
the
tub
cairn
stamped
the
swelling
buds
under
his
feet
a
profusion
of
colourless
sap
was
pouring
out
upon
the
floor
above
the
intoxicating
odour
of
the
place
a
smell
like
that
of
blood
made
itself
perceptible
the
second
match
went
out
another
cairn
voice
rose
barely
above
a
whisper
with
fingers
quivering
robert
cairn
managed
to
light
a
third
match
his
father
from
a
second
tub
tore
out
a
smaller
plant
and
ground
its
soft
tentacles
beneath
his
feet
the
place
smelt
like
an
operating
theatre
the
doctor
swayed
dizzily
as
the
third
match
became
extinguished
clutching
at
his
son
for
support
her
life
was
in
it
boy
he
whispered
she
would
have
died
in
the
hour
that
it
bloomed

priestesses
were
consecrated
to
this

into

pathetically

with

shadow
gone
from

chapter
xxv
cairn
meets
ferrara
not
the
least
of
the
trials
which
robert
cairn
experienced
during
the
time
that
he
and
his
father
were
warring
with
their
supernaturally
equipped
opponent
was
that
of
preserving
silence
upon
this
matter
which
loomed
so
large
in
his
mind
and
which
already
had
changed
the
course
of
his
life
sometimes
he
met
men
who
knew
ferrara
but
who
knew
him
only
as
a
man
about
town
of
somewhat
evil
reputation
yet
even
to
these
he
dared
not
confide
what
he
knew
of
the
true
ferrara
undoubtedly
they
would
have
deemed
him
mad
had
he
spoken
of
the
knowledge
and
of
the
deeds
of
this
uncanny
this
fiendish
being
how
would
they
have
listened
to
him
had
he
sought
to
tell
them
of
the
den
of
spiders
in
port
said
of
the
bats
of
m√©yd√ªm
of
the
secret
incense
and
of
how
it
was
made
of
the
numberless
murders
and
atrocities
wrought
by
means
not
human
which
stood
to
the
account
of
this
adopted
son
of
the
late
sir
michael
ferrara
so
excepting
his
father
he
had
no
confidant
for
above
all
it
was
necessary
to
keep
the
truth
from
myra
duquesne
from
myra
around
whom
his
world
circled
but
who
yet
thought
of
the
dreadful
being
who
wielded
the
sorcery
of
forgotten
ages
as
a
brother
whilst
myra
lay
ill
not
yet
recovered
from
the
ghastly
attack
made
upon
her
life
by
the
man
whom
she
trusted
whilst
having
plentiful
evidence
of
his
presence
in
london
cairn
and
himself
vainly
sought
for
antony
ferrara
whilst
any
night
might
bring
some
unholy
visitant
to
his
rooms
obedient
to
the
will
of
this
modern
wizard
whilst
these
fears
anxieties
doubts
and
surmises
danced
impish
through
his
brain
it
was
all
but
impossible
to
pursue
with
success
his
vocation
of
journalism
yet
for
many
reasons
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
do
so
and
so
he
was
employed
upon
a
series
of
articles
which
were
the
outcome
of
his
recent
visit
to
egypt
his
editor
having
given
him
that
work
as
being
less
exacting
than
that
which
properly
falls
to
the
lot
of
the
fleet
street
he
left
his
rooms
about
three
in
the
afternoon
in
order
to
seek
in
the
british
museum
library
a
reference
which
he
lacked
the
day
was
an
exceedingly
warm
one
and
he
derived
some
little
satisfaction
from
the
fact
that
at
his
present
work
he
was
not
called
upon
to
endue
the
armour
of
respectability
pipe
in
mouth
he
made
his
way
across
the
strand
towards
bloomsbury
as
he
walked
up
the
steps
crossed
the
and
passed
in
beneath
the
dome
of
the
he
wondered
if
amid
those
mountains
of
erudition
surrounding
him
there
was
any
wisdom
so
strange
and
so
awful
as
that
of
antony
ferrara
he
soon
found
the
information
for
which
he
was
looking
and
having
copied
it
into
his
notebook
he
left
the
then
as
he
was
recrossing
the
hall
near
the
foot
of
the
principal
staircase
he
paused
he
found
himself
possessed
by
a
sudden
desire
to
visit
the
egyptian
rooms
upstairs
he
had
several
times
inspected
the
exhibits
in
those
apartments
but
never
since
his
return
from
the
land
to
whose
ancient
civilisation
they
bore
witness
cairn
was
not
pressed
for
time
in
these
days
therefore
he
turned
and
passed
slowly
up
the
stairs
there
were
but
few
visitors
to
the
grove
of
mummies
that
afternoon
when
he
entered
the
first
room
he
found
a
small
group
of
tourists
passing
idly
from
case
to
case
but
on
entering
the
second
he
saw
that
he
had
the
apartment
to
himself
he
remembered
that
his
father
had
mentioned
on
one
occasion
that
there
was
a
ring
in
this
room
which
had
belonged
to
the
robert
cairn
wondered
in
which
of
the
cases
it
was
exhibited
and
by
what
means
he
should
be
enabled
to
recognise
it
bending
over
a
case
containing
scarabs
and
other
amulets
many
set
in
rings
he
began
to
read
the
inscriptions
upon
the
little
tickets
placed
beneath
some
of
them
but
none
answered
to
the
description
neither
the
ticketed
nor
the
unticketed
a
second
case
he
examined
with
like
results
but
on
passing
to
a
third
in
an
angle
near
the
door
his
gaze
immediately
lighted
upon
a
gold
ring
set
with
a
strange
green
stone
engraved
in
a
peculiar
way
it
bore
no
ticket
yet
as
robert
cairn
eagerly
bent
over
it
he
knew
beyond
the
possibility
of
doubt
that
this
was
the
ring
of
the
where
had
he
seen
it
or
its
duplicate
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
gleaming
stone
he
sought
to
remember
that
he
had
seen
this
ring
before
or
one
exactly
like
it
he
knew
but
strangely
enough
he
was
unable
to
determine
where
and
upon
what
occasion
so
his
hands
resting
upon
the
case
he
leant
peering
down
at
the
singular
gem
and
as
he
stood
thus
frowning
in
the
effort
of
recollection
a
dull
white
hand
having
long
tapered
fingers
glided
across
the
glass
until
it
rested
directly
beneath
his
eyes
upon
one
of
the
slim
fingers
was
an
exact
replica
of
the
ring
in
the
case
robert
cairn
leapt
back
with
a
stifled
exclamation
antony
ferrara
stood
before
him
the
museum
ring
is
a
copy
dear
cairn
came
the
huskily
musical
hateful
voice
the
one
upon
my
finger
is
the
real
one
cairn
realised
in
his
own
person
the
literal
meaning
of
the
overworked
phrase
frozen
with
amazement
before
him
stood
the
most
dangerous
man
in
europe
a
man
who
had
done
murder
and
worse
a
man
only
in
name
a
demon
in
nature
his
long
black
eyes
his
perfectly
chiselled
ivory
face
expressionless
and
his
lips
parted
in
a
mirthless
smile
antony
ferrara
watched
cairn
cairn
whom
he
had
sought
to
murder
by
means
of
hellish
art
despite
the
heat
of
the
day
he
wore
a
heavy
overcoat
lined
with
white
fox
fur
in
his
right
hand
for
his
left
still
rested
upon
the
case
he
held
a
soft
hat
with
an
easy
nonchalance
he
stood
regarding
the
man
who
had
sworn
to
kill
him
and
the
latter
made
no
move
uttered
no
word
stark
amazement
held
him
inert
i
knew
that
you
were
in
the
museum
cairn
ferrara
continued
still
having
his
basilisk
eyes
fixed
upon
the
other
from
beneath
the
drooping
lids
and
i
called
to
you
to
join
me
here
still
cairn
did
not
move
did
not
speak
you
have
acted
very
harshly
towards
me
in
the
past
dear
cairn
but
because
my
philosophy
consists
in
an
admirable
blending
of
that
practised
in
sybaris
with
that
advocated
by
the
excellent
zeno
because
whilst
i
am
prepared
to
make
my
home
in
a
diogenes
tub
i
nevertheless
can
enjoy
the
fragrance
of
a
rose
the
flavour
of
a
peach
the
husky
voice
seemed
to
be
hypnotising
cairn
it
was
a
voice
thralling
him
because
continued
ferrara
evenly
in
common
with
all
humanity
i
am
compound
of
man
and
woman
i
can
resent
the
enmity
which
drives
me
from
shore
to
shore
but
being
myself
a
connoisseur
of
the
red
lips
and
laughing
eyes
of
maidenhood
i
am
thinking
more
particularly
of
myra
i
can
forgive
you
dear
cairn
then
cairn
recovered
himself
you
cur
he
snarled
through
clenched
teeth
his
knuckles
whitened
as
he
stepped
around
the
case
you
dare
to
stand
there
mocking
me
ferrara
again
placed
the
case
between
himself
and
his
enemy
pause
my
dear
cairn
he
said
without
emotion
what
would
you
do
be
discreet
dear
cairn
reflect
that
i
have
only
to
call
an
attendant
in
order
to
have
you
pitched
ignominiously
into
the
street
before
god
i
will
throttle
the
life
from
you
said
cairn
in
a
voice
savagely
hoarse
he
sprang
again
towards
ferrara
again
the
latter
dodged
around
the
case
with
an
agility
which
defied
the
heavier
man
your
temperament
is
so
painfully
celtic
cairn
he
protested
mockingly
i
perceive
quite
clearly
that
you
will
not
discuss
this
matter
judicially
must
i
then
call
for
the
attendant
cairn
clenched
his
fists
convulsively
through
all
the
tumult
of
his
rage
the
fact
had
penetrated
that
he
was
helpless
he
could
not
attack
ferrara
in
that
place
he
could
not
detain
him
against
his
will
for
ferrara
had
only
to
claim
official
protection
to
bring
about
the
complete
discomfiture
of
his
assailant
across
the
case
containing
the
duplicate
ring
he
glared
at
this
incarnate
fiend
whom
the
law
which
he
had
secretly
outraged
now
served
to
protect
ferrara
spoke
again
in
his
huskily
musical
voice
i
regret
that
you
will
not
be
reasonable
cairn
there
is
so
much
that
i
should
like
to
say
to
you
there
are
so
many
things
of
interest
which
i
could
tell
you
do
you
know
in
some
respects
i
am
peculiarly
gifted
cairn
at
times
i
can
recollect
quite
distinctly
particulars
of
former
incarnations
do
you
see
that
priestess
lying
there
just
through
the
doorway
i
can
quite
distinctly
remember
having
met
her
when
she
was
a
girl
she
was
beautiful
cairn
and
i
can
even
recall
how
one
night
beside
the
nile
but
i
see
that
you
are
growing
impatient
if
you
will
not
avail
yourself
of
this
opportunity
i
must
bid
you
he
turned
and
walked
towards
the
door
cairn
leapt
after
him
but
ferrara
suddenly
beginning
to
run
reached
the
end
of
the
egyptian
room
and
darted
out
on
to
the
landing
before
his
pursuer
had
time
to
realise
what
he
was
about
at
the
moment
that
ferrara
turned
the
corner
ahead
of
him
cairn
saw
something
drop
coming
to
the
end
of
the
room
he
stooped
and
picked
up
this
object
which
was
a
plaited
silk
cord
about
three
feet
in
length
he
did
not
pause
to
examine
it
more
closely
but
thrust
it
into
his
pocket
and
raced
down
the
steps
after
the
retreating
figure
of
ferrara
at
the
foot
a
constable
held
out
his
arm
detaining
him
cairn
stopped
in
surprise
i
must
ask
you
for
your
name
and
address
said
the
constable
gruffly
for
heaven
sake
what
for
a
gentleman
has
complained
my
good
man
exclaimed
cairn
and
proffered
his
card
it
is
it
is
a
practical
joke
on
his
part
i
know
him
well
the
constable
looked
at
the
card
and
from
the
card
suspiciously
back
to
cairn
apparently
the
appearance
of
the
latter
reassured
him
or
he
may
have
formed
a
better
opinion
of
cairn
from
the
fact
that
had
quickly
changed
hands
all
right
sir
he
said
it
is
no
affair
of
mine
he
did
not
charge
you
with
anything
he
only
asked
me
to
prevent
you
from
following
him
quite
so
snapped
cairn
irritably
and
dashed
off
along
the
gallery
in
the
hope
of
overtaking
ferrara
but
as
he
had
feared
ferrara
had
made
good
use
of
his
ruse
to
escape
he
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
and
cairn
was
left
to
wonder
with
what
object
he
had
risked
the
encounter
in
the
egyptian
room
for
that
it
had
been
deliberate
and
not
accidental
he
quite
clearly
perceived
he
walked
down
the
steps
of
the
museum
deep
in
reflection
the
thought
that
he
and
his
father
for
months
had
been
seeking
the
fiend
ferrara
that
they
were
sworn
to
kill
him
as
they
would
kill
a
mad
dog
and
that
he
robert
cairn
had
stood
face
to
face
with
ferrara
had
spoken
with
him
and
had
let
him
go
free
unscathed
was
maddening
yet
in
the
circumstances
how
could
he
have
acted
otherwise
with
no
recollection
of
having
traversed
the
intervening
streets
he
found
himself
walking
under
the
archway
leading
to
the
court
in
which
his
chambers
were
situated
in
the
far
corner
shadowed
by
the
tall
plane
tree
where
the
worn
iron
railings
of
the
steps
and
the
small
panes
of
glass
in
the
solicitor
window
on
the
ground
floor
called
up
memories
of
charles
dickens
he
paused
filled
with
a
sort
of
wonderment
it
seemed
strange
to
him
that
such
an
air
of
peace
could
prevail
anywhere
whilst
antony
ferrara
lived
and
remained
at
large
he
ran
up
the
stairs
to
the
second
landing
opened
the
door
and
entered
his
chambers
he
was
oppressed
with
a
memory
the
memory
of
certain
gruesome
happenings
whereof
these
rooms
had
been
the
scene
knowing
the
powers
of
antony
ferrara
he
often
doubted
the
wisdom
of
living
there
alone
but
he
was
persuaded
that
to
allow
these
fears
to
make
headway
would
be
to
yield
a
point
to
the
enemy
yet
there
were
nights
when
he
found
himself
sleepless
listening
for
sounds
which
had
seemed
to
arouse
him
imagining
sinister
whispers
in
his
room
and
imagining
that
he
could
detect
the
dreadful
odour
of
the
secret
incense
seating
himself
by
the
open
window
he
took
out
from
his
pocket
the
silken
cord
which
ferrara
had
dropped
in
the
museum
and
examined
it
curiously
his
examination
of
the
thing
did
not
serve
to
enlighten
him
respecting
its
character
it
was
merely
a
piece
of
silken
cord
very
closely
and
curiously
plaited
he
threw
it
down
on
the
table
determined
to
show
it
to
cairn
at
the
earliest
opportunity
he
was
conscious
of
a
sort
of
repugnance
and
prompted
by
this
he
carefully
washed
his
hands
as
though
the
cord
had
been
some
unclean
thing
then
he
sat
down
to
work
only
to
realise
immediately
that
work
was
impossible
until
he
had
confided
in
somebody
his
encounter
with
ferrara
lifting
the
telephone
receiver
he
called
up
cairn
but
his
father
was
not
at
home
he
replaced
the
receiver
and
sat
staring
vaguely
at
his
open
notebook
chapter
xxvi
the
ivory
hand
for
close
upon
an
hour
robert
cairn
sat
at
his
endeavouring
to
puzzle
out
a
solution
to
the
mystery
of
motive
his
reflections
served
only
to
confuse
his
mind
a
tangible
clue
lay
upon
the
table
before
him
the
silken
cord
but
it
was
a
clue
of
such
a
nature
that
whatever
deductions
an
expert
detective
might
have
based
upon
it
robert
cairn
could
base
none
dusk
was
not
far
off
and
he
knew
that
his
nerves
were
not
what
they
had
been
before
those
events
which
had
led
to
his
egyptian
journey
he
was
back
in
his
own
chamber
scene
of
one
gruesome
outrage
in
unholy
campaign
for
darkness
is
the
ally
of
crime
and
it
had
always
been
in
the
darkness
that
ferrara
activities
had
most
fearfully
manifested
themselves
what
was
that
cairn
ran
to
the
window
and
leaning
out
looked
down
into
the
court
below
he
could
have
sworn
that
a
voice
a
voice
possessing
a
strange
music
a
husky
music
wholly
hateful
had
called
him
by
name
but
at
the
moment
the
court
was
deserted
for
it
was
already
past
the
hour
at
which
members
of
the
legal
fraternity
desert
their
business
premises
to
hasten
homewards
shadows
were
creeping
under
the
quaint
old
archways
shadows
were
draping
the
ancient
walls
and
there
was
something
in
the
aspect
of
the
place
which
reminded
him
of
a
quadrangle
at
oxford
across
which
upon
a
certain
fateful
evening
he
and
another
had
watched
the
red
light
rising
and
falling
in
antony
ferrara
rooms
clearly
his
imagination
was
playing
him
tricks
and
against
this
he
knew
full
well
that
he
must
guard
himself
the
light
in
his
rooms
was
growing
dim
but
instinctively
his
gaze
sought
out
and
found
the
mysterious
silken
cord
amid
the
litter
on
the
table
he
contemplated
the
telephone
but
since
he
had
left
a
message
for
his
father
he
knew
that
the
latter
would
ring
him
up
directly
he
returned
work
he
thought
should
be
the
likeliest
antidote
to
the
poisonous
thoughts
which
oppressed
his
mind
and
again
he
seated
himself
at
the
table
and
opened
his
notes
before
him
the
silken
rope
lay
close
to
his
left
hand
but
he
did
not
touch
it
he
was
about
to
switch
on
the
reading
lamp
for
it
was
now
too
dark
to
write
when
his
mind
wandered
off
along
another
channel
of
reflection
he
found
himself
picturing
myra
as
she
had
looked
the
last
time
that
he
had
seen
her
she
was
seated
in
saunderson
garden
still
pale
from
her
dreadful
illness
but
beautiful
more
beautiful
in
the
eyes
of
robert
cairn
than
any
other
woman
in
the
world
the
breeze
was
blowing
her
rebellious
curls
across
her
eyes
eyes
bright
with
a
happiness
which
he
loved
to
see
her
cheeks
were
paler
than
they
were
wont
to
be
and
the
sweet
lips
had
lost
something
of
their
firmness
she
wore
a
short
cloak
and
a
hat
unfashionable
but
becoming
no
one
but
myra
could
successfully
have
worn
that
hat
he
thought
wrapt
in
such
memories
he
forgot
that
he
had
sat
down
to
write
forgot
that
he
held
a
pen
in
his
hand
and
that
this
same
hand
had
been
outstretched
to
ignite
the
lamp
when
he
ultimately
awoke
again
to
the
hard
facts
of
his
lonely
environment
he
also
awoke
to
a
singular
circumstance
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
strange
phenomenon
he
had
been
writing
unconsciously
and
this
was
what
he
had
written
robert
cairn
renounce
your
pursuit
of
me
and
renounce
myra
or
the
sentence
was
unfinished
momentarily
he
stared
at
the
words
endeavouring
to
persuade
himself
that
he
had
written
them
consciously
in
idle
mood
but
some
voice
within
gave
him
the
lie
so
that
with
a
suppressed
groan
he
muttered
aloud
it
has
begun
almost
as
he
spoke
there
came
a
sound
from
the
passage
outside
that
led
him
to
slide
his
hand
across
the
table
and
to
seize
his
revolver
the
visible
presence
of
the
little
weapon
reassured
him
and
as
a
further
sedative
he
resorted
to
tobacco
filled
and
lighted
his
pipe
and
leant
back
in
the
chair
blowing
smoke
rings
towards
the
closed
door
he
listened
intently
and
heard
the
sound
again
it
was
a
soft
and
now
he
thought
he
could
detect
another
noise
as
of
some
creature
dragging
its
body
along
the
floor
a
lizard
he
thought
and
a
memory
of
the
basilisk
eyes
of
antony
ferrara
came
to
him
both
the
sounds
seemed
to
come
slowly
nearer
and
nearer
the
dragging
thing
being
evidently
responsible
for
the
hissing
until
cairn
decided
that
the
creature
must
be
immediately
outside
the
door
revolver
in
hand
he
leapt
across
the
room
and
threw
the
door
open
the
red
carpet
to
right
and
left
was
innocent
of
reptiles
perhaps
the
creaking
of
the
revolving
chair
as
he
had
prepared
to
quit
it
had
frightened
the
thing
with
the
idea
before
him
he
systematically
searched
all
the
rooms
into
which
it
might
have
gone
his
search
was
unavailing
the
mysterious
reptile
was
not
to
be
found
returning
again
to
the
study
he
seated
himself
behind
the
table
facing
the
door
which
he
left
ajar
ten
minutes
passed
in
silence
only
broken
by
the
dim
murmur
of
the
distant
traffic
he
had
almost
persuaded
himself
that
his
imagination
quickened
by
the
atmosphere
of
mystery
and
horror
wherein
he
had
recently
moved
was
responsible
for
the
hiss
when
a
new
sound
came
to
confute
his
reasoning
the
people
occupying
the
chambers
below
were
moving
about
so
that
their
footsteps
were
faintly
audible
but
above
these
dim
footsteps
a
rustling
vague
indefinite
demonstrated
itself
as
in
the
case
of
the
hiss
it
proceeded
from
the
passage
a
light
burnt
inside
the
outer
door
and
this
as
cairn
knew
must
cast
a
shadow
before
any
thing
or
person
approaching
the
room
ssf
came
like
the
rustle
of
light
draperies
the
nervous
suspense
was
almost
unbearable
he
waited
was
creeping
slowly
cautiously
towards
the
open
door
cairn
toyed
with
the
trigger
of
his
revolver
the
arts
of
the
west
shall
try
conclusions
with
those
of
the
east
he
said
a
shadow
inch
upon
inch
it
grew
creeping
across
the
door
until
it
covered
all
the
threshold
visible
someone
was
about
to
appear
he
raised
the
revolver
the
shadow
moved
along
cairn
saw
the
tail
of
it
creep
past
the
door
until
no
shadow
was
there
the
shadow
had
come
and
gone
but
there
was
i
am
going
mad
the
words
forced
themselves
to
his
lips
he
rested
his
chin
upon
his
hands
and
clenched
his
teeth
grimly
did
the
horrors
of
insanity
stare
him
in
the
face
from
that
recent
illness
in
london
when
his
nervous
system
had
collapsed
utterly
despite
his
stay
in
egypt
he
had
never
fully
recovered
a
month
will
see
you
fit
again
his
father
had
said
but
perhaps
he
had
been
wrong
perchance
the
affection
had
been
deeper
than
he
had
suspected
and
now
this
endless
carnival
of
supernatural
happenings
had
strained
the
weakened
cells
so
that
he
was
become
as
a
man
in
a
delirium
where
did
reality
end
and
phantasy
begin
was
it
all
merely
subjective
he
had
read
of
such
aberrations
and
now
he
sat
wondering
if
he
were
the
victim
of
a
like
affliction
and
while
he
wondered
he
stared
at
the
rope
of
silk
that
was
real
logic
came
to
his
rescue
if
he
had
seen
and
heard
strange
things
so
too
had
sime
in
egypt
so
had
his
father
both
in
egypt
and
in
london
inexplicable
things
were
happening
around
him
and
all
could
not
be
mad
i
getting
morbid
again
he
told
himself
the
tricks
of
our
damnable
ferrara
are
getting
on
my
nerves
just
what
he
desires
and
intends
this
latter
reflection
spurred
him
to
new
activity
and
pocketing
the
revolver
he
switched
off
the
light
in
the
study
and
looked
out
of
the
window
glancing
across
the
court
he
thought
that
he
saw
a
man
standing
below
peering
upward
with
his
hands
resting
upon
the
window
ledge
cairn
looked
long
and
steadily
there
certainly
was
someone
standing
in
the
shadow
of
the
tall
plane
tree
but
whether
man
or
woman
he
could
not
determine
the
unknown
remaining
in
the
same
position
apparently
watching
cairn
ran
downstairs
and
passing
out
into
the
court
walked
rapidly
across
to
the
tree
there
he
paused
in
some
surprise
there
was
no
one
visible
by
the
tree
and
the
whole
court
was
quite
deserted
must
have
slipped
off
through
the
archway
he
concluded
and
walking
back
he
remounted
the
stair
and
entered
his
chambers
again
feeling
a
renewed
curiosity
regarding
the
silken
rope
which
had
so
strangely
come
into
his
possession
he
sat
down
at
the
table
and
mastering
his
distaste
for
the
thing
took
it
in
his
hands
and
examined
it
closely
by
the
light
of
the
lamp
he
was
seated
with
his
back
to
the
windows
facing
the
door
so
that
no
one
could
possibly
have
entered
the
room
unseen
by
him
it
was
as
he
bent
down
to
scrutinise
the
curious
plaiting
that
he
felt
a
sensation
stealing
over
him
as
though
someone
were
standing
very
close
to
his
chair
grimly
determined
to
resist
any
hypnotic
tricks
that
might
be
practised
against
him
and
well
assured
that
there
could
be
no
person
actually
present
in
the
chambers
he
sat
back
resting
his
revolver
on
his
knee
prompted
by
he
knew
not
what
he
slipped
the
silk
cord
into
the
table
drawer
and
turned
the
key
upon
it
as
he
did
so
a
hand
crept
over
his
shoulder
followed
by
a
bare
arm
of
the
hue
of
old
ivory
a
woman
arm
transfixed
he
sat
his
eyes
fastened
upon
the
ring
of
dull
metal
bearing
a
green
stone
inscribed
with
a
complex
figure
vaguely
resembling
a
spider
which
adorned
the
index
finger
a
faint
perfume
stole
to
his
nostrils
that
of
the
secret
incense
and
the
ring
was
the
ring
of
the
in
this
incredible
moment
he
relaxed
that
iron
control
of
his
mind
which
alone
had
saved
him
before
even
as
he
realised
it
and
strove
to
recover
himself
he
knew
that
it
was
too
late
he
knew
that
he
was
lost
gloom
blackness
unrelieved
by
any
speck
of
light
murmuring
subdued
all
around
the
murmuring
of
a
concourse
of
people
the
darkness
was
odorous
with
a
heavy
perfume
a
voice
came
followed
by
complete
silence
again
the
voice
sounded
chanting
sweetly
a
response
followed
in
deep
male
voices
the
response
was
taken
up
all
around
what
time
a
tiny
speck
grew
in
the
gloom
and
grew
until
it
took
form
and
out
of
the
darkness
the
shape
of
a
woman
appeared
high
up
far
away
wherever
the
ray
that
illumined
her
figure
emanated
from
it
did
not
perceptibly
dispel
the
stygian
gloom
all
about
her
she
was
bathed
in
dazzling
light
but
framed
in
impenetrable
darkness
her
dull
gold
hair
was
encircled
by
a
band
of
white
metal
like
silver
bearing
in
front
a
round
burnished
disk
that
shone
like
a
minor
sun
above
the
disk
projected
an
ornament
having
the
shape
of
a
spider
the
intense
light
picked
out
every
detail
vividly
neck
and
shoulders
were
bare
and
the
gleaming
ivory
arms
were
uplifted
the
long
slender
fingers
held
aloft
a
golden
casket
covered
with
dim
figures
almost
undiscernible
at
that
distance
a
glittering
zone
of
the
same
white
metal
confined
the
snowy
draperies
her
bare
feet
peeped
out
from
beneath
the
flowing
robe
above
below
and
around
her
was
memphian
darkness
silence
the
perfume
was
stifling
a
voice
seeming
to
come
from
a
great
distance
cried
on
your
knees
to
the
book
of
thoth
on
your
knees
to
the
wisdom
queen
who
is
deathless
being
unborn
who
is
dead
though
living
whose
beauty
is
for
all
men
that
all
men
may
die
the
whole
invisible
concourse
took
up
the
chant
and
the
light
faded
until
only
the
speck
on
the
disk
below
the
spider
was
visible
then
that
too
vanished
a
bell
was
ringing
furiously
its
din
grew
louder
and
louder
it
became
insupportable
cairn
threw
out
his
arms
and
staggered
up
like
a
man
intoxicated
he
grasped
at
the
only
just
in
time
to
prevent
it
overturning
the
ringing
was
that
of
his
telephone
bell
he
had
been
unconscious
then
under
some
spell
he
unhooked
the
receiver
and
heard
his
father
voice
that
you
rob
asked
the
doctor
anxiously
yes
sir
replied
cairn
eagerly
and
he
opened
the
drawer
and
slid
his
hand
in
for
the
silken
cord
there
is
something
you
have
to
tell
me
cairn
without
preamble
plunged
excitedly
into
an
account
of
his
meeting
with
ferrara
the
silk
cord
he
concluded
i
have
in
my
hand
at
the
present
moment
and
hold
on
a
moment
came
cairn
voice
rather
grimly
followed
a
short
interval
then
hullo
rob
listen
to
this
from
paper
curious
discovery
was
made
by
an
attendant
in
one
of
the
rooms
of
the
indian
section
of
the
british
museum
late
this
evening
a
case
had
been
opened
in
some
way
and
although
it
contained
more
valuable
objects
the
only
item
which
the
thief
had
abstracted
was
a
from
kund√©lee
district
of
nursingpore
but
i
do
understand
ferrara
you
to
find
that
cord
boy
remember
he
is
unacquainted
with
your
chambers
and
he
requires
a
for
his
damnable
forces
he
knows
well
that
you
will
have
the
thing
somewhere
near
to
you
and
probably
he
knows
something
of
its
awful
history
you
are
in
danger
keep
a
fast
hold
upon
yourself
i
shall
be
with
you
in
less
than
chapter
xxvii
the
thug
cord
as
robert
cairn
hung
up
the
receiver
and
found
himself
cut
off
again
from
the
outer
world
he
realised
with
terror
beyond
his
control
how
in
this
quiet
backwater
so
near
to
the
main
stream
he
yet
was
far
from
human
companionship
he
recalled
a
night
when
amid
such
a
silence
as
this
which
now
prevailed
about
him
he
had
been
made
the
subject
of
an
uncanny
demonstration
how
his
sanity
his
life
had
been
attacked
how
he
had
fled
from
the
crowding
horrors
which
had
been
massed
against
him
by
his
supernaturally
endowed
enemy
there
was
something
very
terrifying
in
the
quietude
of
the
court
a
quietude
which
to
others
might
have
spelt
peace
but
which
to
robert
cairn
spelled
menace
that
ferrara
device
was
aimed
at
his
freedom
that
his
design
was
intended
to
lead
to
the
detention
of
his
enemy
whilst
he
directed
his
activities
in
other
directions
seemed
plausible
if
inadequate
the
carefully
planned
incident
at
the
museum
whereby
the
constable
had
become
possessed
of
cairn
card
the
distinct
possibility
that
a
detective
might
knock
upon
his
door
at
any
moment
with
the
inevitable
result
of
his
detention
pending
inquiries
formed
a
chain
which
had
seemed
complete
save
that
antony
ferrara
was
the
schemer
for
another
to
have
compassed
so
much
would
have
been
a
notable
victory
for
ferrara
such
a
victory
would
be
trivial
what
then
did
it
mean
his
father
had
told
him
and
the
uncanny
events
of
the
evening
stood
evidence
of
cairn
wisdom
the
mysterious
and
evil
force
which
antony
ferrara
controlled
was
being
focussed
upon
him
slight
sounds
from
time
to
time
disturbed
the
silence
and
to
these
he
listened
attentively
he
longed
for
the
arrival
of
his
father
for
the
strong
calm
counsel
of
the
one
man
in
england
fitted
to
cope
with
the
hell
thing
which
had
uprisen
in
their
midst
that
he
had
already
been
subjected
to
some
kind
of
hypnotic
influence
he
was
unable
to
doubt
and
having
once
been
subjected
to
this
influence
he
might
at
any
moment
it
was
a
terrible
reflection
fall
a
victim
to
it
again
cairn
directed
all
the
energies
of
his
mind
to
resistance
reflection
must
at
all
costs
be
avoided
for
the
brain
vaguely
employed
he
knew
to
be
more
susceptible
to
attack
than
that
directed
in
a
channel
clocks
were
chiming
the
hour
he
did
not
know
what
hour
nor
did
he
seek
to
learn
he
felt
that
he
was
at
rapier
play
with
a
skilled
antagonist
and
that
to
glance
aside
however
momentarily
was
to
lay
himself
open
to
a
fatal
thrust
he
had
not
moved
from
the
table
so
that
only
the
reading
lamp
upon
it
was
lighted
and
much
of
the
room
lay
in
half
shadow
the
silken
cord
coiled
was
close
to
his
left
hand
the
revolver
was
close
to
his
right
the
muffled
roar
of
traffic
diminished
since
the
hour
grew
late
reached
his
ears
as
he
sat
but
nothing
disturbed
the
stillness
of
the
court
and
nothing
disturbed
the
stillness
of
the
room
the
notes
which
he
had
made
in
the
afternoon
at
the
museum
were
still
spread
open
before
him
and
he
suddenly
closed
the
book
fearful
of
anything
calculated
to
distract
him
from
the
mood
of
tense
resistance
his
life
and
more
than
his
life
depended
upon
his
successfully
opposing
the
insidious
forces
which
beyond
doubt
invisibly
surrounded
that
lighted
table
there
is
a
courage
which
is
not
physical
nor
is
it
entirely
moral
a
courage
often
lacking
in
the
most
intrepid
soldier
and
this
was
the
kind
of
courage
which
robert
cairn
now
called
up
to
his
aid
the
occult
inquirer
can
face
unmoved
horrors
which
would
turn
the
brain
of
many
a
man
who
wears
the
on
the
other
hand
it
is
questionable
if
the
possessor
of
this
peculiar
type
of
bravery
could
face
a
bayonet
charge
pluck
of
the
physical
sort
cairn
had
in
plenty
pluck
of
that
more
subtle
kind
he
was
acquiring
from
growing
intimacy
with
the
terrors
of
the
borderland
who
there
he
spoke
the
words
aloud
and
the
eerie
sound
of
his
own
voice
added
a
new
dread
to
the
enveloping
shadows
his
revolver
grasped
in
his
hand
he
stood
up
but
slowly
and
cautiously
in
order
that
his
own
movements
might
not
prevent
him
from
hearing
any
repetition
of
that
which
had
occasioned
his
alarm
and
what
had
occasioned
this
alarm
either
he
was
become
again
a
victim
of
the
strange
trickery
which
already
had
borne
him
though
not
physically
from
fleet
street
to
the
secret
temple
of
m√©yd√ªm
or
with
his
material
senses
he
had
detected
a
soft
rapping
upon
the
door
of
his
room
he
knew
that
his
outer
door
was
closed
he
knew
that
there
was
no
one
else
in
his
chambers
yet
he
had
heard
a
sound
as
of
knuckles
beating
upon
the
panels
of
the
door
the
closed
door
of
the
room
in
which
he
sat
standing
upright
he
turned
deliberately
and
faced
in
that
direction
the
light
pouring
out
from
beneath
the
shade
of
the
scarcely
touched
upon
the
door
at
all
only
the
edges
of
the
lower
panels
were
clearly
perceptible
the
upper
part
of
the
door
was
masked
in
greenish
shadow
intent
tensely
strung
he
stood
then
advanced
in
the
direction
of
the
switch
in
order
to
light
the
lamp
fixed
above
the
and
to
illuminate
the
whole
of
the
room
one
step
forward
he
took
then
the
soft
rapping
was
repeated
who
there
this
time
he
cried
the
words
loudly
and
acquired
some
new
assurance
from
the
imperative
note
in
his
own
voice
he
ran
to
the
switch
and
pressed
it
down
the
lamp
did
not
light
the
filament
has
burnt
out
he
muttered
terror
grew
upon
him
a
terror
akin
to
that
which
children
experience
in
the
darkness
but
he
yet
had
a
fair
mastery
of
his
emotions
when
not
suddenly
as
is
the
way
of
a
failing
electric
lamp
but
slowly
uncannily
unnaturally
the
became
extinguished
darkness
cairn
turned
towards
the
window
this
was
a
moonless
night
and
little
enough
illumination
entered
the
room
from
the
court
three
resounding
raps
were
struck
upon
the
door
at
that
terror
had
no
darker
meaning
for
cairn
he
had
plumbed
its
ultimate
deeps
and
now
like
a
diver
he
arose
again
to
the
surface
heedless
of
the
darkness
of
the
seemingly
supernatural
means
by
which
it
had
been
occasioned
he
threw
open
the
door
and
thrust
his
revolver
out
into
the
corridor
for
terrors
he
had
been
prepared
for
some
gruesome
shape
such
as
we
read
of
in
but
there
was
nothing
instinctively
he
had
looked
straight
ahead
of
him
as
one
looks
who
expects
to
encounter
a
human
enemy
but
the
was
empty
a
dim
light
finding
access
over
the
door
from
the
stair
prevailed
there
yet
it
was
sufficient
to
have
revealed
the
presence
of
anyone
or
anything
had
anyone
or
anything
been
present
cairn
stepped
out
from
the
room
and
was
about
to
walk
to
the
outer
door
the
idea
of
flight
was
strong
upon
him
for
no
man
can
fight
the
invisible
when
on
a
level
with
his
eyes
flat
against
the
wall
as
though
someone
crouched
there
he
saw
two
white
hands
they
were
slim
hands
like
the
hands
of
a
woman
and
upon
one
of
the
tapered
fingers
there
dully
gleamed
a
green
stone
a
peal
of
laughter
came
chokingly
from
his
lips
he
knew
that
his
reason
was
tottering
for
these
two
white
hands
which
now
moved
along
the
wall
as
though
they
were
sidling
to
the
room
which
cairn
had
just
quitted
were
attached
to
no
visible
body
just
two
ivory
hands
were
there
nothing
that
he
was
in
deadly
peril
cairn
realised
fully
his
complete
subjection
by
the
of
ferrara
had
been
interrupted
by
the
ringing
of
the
telephone
bell
but
now
the
attack
had
been
renewed
the
hands
vanished
too
well
he
remembered
the
ghastly
details
attendant
upon
the
death
of
sir
michael
ferrara
to
doubt
that
these
slim
hands
were
directed
upon
murderous
business
a
soft
swishing
sound
reached
him
something
upon
the
had
been
moved
the
strangling
cord
whilst
speaking
to
his
father
he
had
taken
it
out
from
the
drawer
and
when
he
quitted
the
room
it
had
lain
upon
the
he
stepped
back
towards
the
outer
door
something
fluttered
past
his
face
and
he
turned
in
a
mad
panic
the
dreadful
bodiless
hands
groped
in
the
darkness
between
himself
and
the
exit
vaguely
it
came
home
to
him
that
the
menace
might
be
avoidable
he
was
bathed
in
icy
perspiration
he
dropped
the
revolver
into
his
pocket
and
placed
his
hands
upon
his
throat
then
he
began
to
grope
his
way
towards
the
closed
door
of
his
bedroom
lowering
his
left
hand
he
began
to
feel
for
the
doorknob
as
he
did
so
he
saw
and
knew
the
crowning
horror
of
the
night
that
he
had
made
a
false
move
in
retiring
he
had
thrown
away
his
last
his
only
chance
the
phantom
hands
a
yard
apart
and
holding
the
silken
cord
stretched
tightly
between
them
were
approaching
him
swiftly
he
lowered
his
head
and
charged
along
the
passage
with
a
wild
cry
the
cord
stretched
taut
struck
him
under
the
chin
back
he
reeled
the
cord
was
about
his
throat
god
he
choked
and
thrust
up
his
hands
madly
he
strove
to
pluck
the
deadly
silken
thing
from
his
neck
it
was
useless
a
grip
of
steel
was
drawing
it
tightly
and
ever
more
tightly
about
him
despair
touched
him
and
almost
he
resigned
himself
then
rob
rob
open
the
door
cairn
was
outside
a
new
strength
came
and
he
knew
that
it
was
the
last
atom
left
to
him
to
remove
the
rope
was
humanly
impossible
he
dropped
his
cramped
hands
bent
his
body
by
a
mighty
physical
effort
and
hurled
himself
forward
upon
the
door
the
latch
now
was
just
above
his
head
he
stretched
up
and
was
plucked
back
but
the
fingers
of
his
right
hand
grasped
the
knob
convulsively
even
as
that
superhuman
force
jerked
him
back
he
turned
the
knob
and
fell
all
his
weight
hung
upon
the
fingers
which
were
locked
about
that
brass
disk
in
a
grip
which
even
the
powers
of
darkness
could
not
relax
the
door
swung
open
and
cairn
swung
back
with
it
he
collapsed
an
inert
heap
upon
the
floor
cairn
leapt
in
over
him
when
he
reopened
his
eyes
he
lay
in
bed
and
his
father
was
bathing
his
inflamed
throat
all
right
boy
there
no
damage
done
thank
god
the
hands
i
quite
understand
but
saw
no
hands
but
your
own
rob
and
if
it
had
come
to
an
inquest
i
could
not
even
have
raised
my
voice
against
a
verdict
of
suicide
but
i
opened
the
door
they
would
have
said
that
you
repented
your
awful
act
too
late
although
it
is
almost
impossible
for
a
man
to
strangle
himself
under
such
conditions
there
is
no
jury
in
england
who
would
have
believed
that
antony
ferrara
had
done
the
deed
chapter
xxviii
the
high
priest
hortotef
the
of
cairn
house
in
street
presented
a
cheery
appearance
and
this
despite
the
gloom
of
the
morning
for
thunderous
clouds
hung
low
in
the
sky
and
there
were
distant
mutterings
ominous
of
a
brewing
storm
robert
cairn
stood
looking
out
of
the
window
he
was
thinking
of
an
afternoon
at
oxford
when
to
such
an
accompaniment
as
this
he
had
witnessed
the
first
scene
in
the
drama
of
evil
wherein
the
man
called
antony
ferrara
sustained
the
leading
that
the
was
at
any
moment
to
be
anticipated
his
reason
told
him
and
some
instinct
that
was
not
of
his
reason
forewarned
him
too
that
he
and
his
father
cairn
were
now
upon
the
eve
of
that
final
decisive
struggle
which
should
determine
the
triumph
of
good
over
evil
or
of
evil
over
good
already
the
doctor
house
was
invested
by
the
uncanny
forces
marshalled
by
antony
ferrara
against
them
the
distinguished
patients
who
daily
flocked
to
the
of
the
celebrated
specialist
who
witnessed
his
perfect
and
took
comfort
from
his
confidence
knowing
it
for
the
confidence
of
strength
little
suspected
that
a
greater
ill
than
any
flesh
is
heir
to
assailed
the
doctor
to
whom
they
came
for
healing
a
menace
dreadful
and
unnatural
hung
over
that
home
as
now
the
thunder
clouds
hung
over
it
this
household
so
modern
so
typical
of
twentieth
century
culture
and
refinement
presented
none
of
the
appearances
of
a
beleaguered
garrison
yet
the
house
of
cairn
in
street
was
nothing
less
than
an
invested
fortress
a
peal
of
distant
thunder
boomed
from
the
direction
of
hyde
park
robert
cairn
looked
up
at
the
lowering
sky
as
if
seeking
a
portent
to
his
eyes
it
seemed
that
a
livid
face
malignant
with
the
malignancy
of
a
devil
looked
down
out
of
the
clouds
myra
duquesne
came
into
the
he
turned
to
greet
her
and
in
his
capacity
of
accepted
lover
was
about
to
kiss
the
tempting
lips
when
he
hesitated
and
contented
himself
with
kissing
her
hand
a
sudden
sense
of
the
proprieties
had
assailed
him
he
reflected
that
the
presence
of
the
girl
beneath
the
same
roof
as
himself
although
dictated
by
imperative
need
might
be
open
to
misconstruction
by
the
prudish
cairn
had
decided
that
for
the
present
myra
duquesne
must
dwell
beneath
his
own
roof
as
in
feudal
days
the
baron
at
first
hint
of
an
approaching
enemy
formerly
was
accustomed
to
call
within
the
walls
of
the
castle
those
whom
it
was
his
duty
to
protect
unknown
to
the
world
a
tremendous
battle
raged
in
london
the
outer
works
were
in
the
possession
of
the
enemy
and
he
was
now
before
their
very
gates
myra
though
still
pale
from
her
recent
illness
already
was
recovering
some
of
the
freshness
of
her
beauty
and
in
her
simple
morning
dress
as
she
busied
herself
about
the
breakfast
table
she
was
a
sweet
picture
enough
and
good
to
look
upon
robert
cairn
stood
beside
her
looking
into
her
eyes
and
she
smiled
up
at
him
with
a
happy
contentment
which
filled
him
with
a
new
longing
but
did
you
dream
again
last
night
he
asked
in
a
voice
which
he
strove
to
make
myra
nodded
and
her
face
momentarily
clouded
over
the
same
dream
yes
she
said
in
a
troubled
way
at
least
in
some
respects
cairn
came
in
glancing
at
his
watch
good
morning
he
cried
cheerily
i
have
actually
overslept
myself
they
took
their
seats
at
the
table
myra
has
been
dreaming
again
sir
said
robert
cairn
slowly
the
doctor
serviette
in
hand
glanced
up
with
an
inquiry
in
his
grey
eyes
we
must
not
overlook
any
possible
weapon
he
replied
give
us
particulars
of
your
dream
myra
as
marston
entered
silently
with
the
morning
fare
and
having
placed
the
dishes
upon
the
table
as
silently
withdrew
myra
began
i
seemed
to
stand
again
in
the
building
which
i
have
described
to
you
before
through
the
rafters
of
the
roof
i
could
see
the
cracks
in
the
tiling
and
the
moonlight
shone
through
forming
light
and
irregular
patches
upon
the
floor
a
sort
of
door
like
that
of
a
stable
with
a
heavy
bar
across
was
dimly
perceptible
at
the
further
end
of
the
place
the
only
furniture
was
a
large
deal
table
and
a
wooden
chair
of
a
very
common
kind
upon
the
table
stood
a
lamp
what
kind
of
lamp
jerked
cairn
a
silver
lamp
she
hesitated
looking
from
robert
to
his
father
one
that
i
have
seen
in
antony
rooms
its
shaded
light
shone
upon
a
closed
iron
box
i
immediately
recognised
this
box
you
know
that
i
described
to
you
a
dream
which
terrified
me
on
the
previous
night
cairn
nodded
frowning
darkly
repeat
your
account
of
the
former
dream
he
said
i
regard
it
as
important
in
my
former
dream
the
girl
resumed
and
her
voice
had
an
odd
quality
the
scene
was
the
same
except
that
the
light
of
the
lamp
was
shining
down
upon
the
leaves
of
an
open
book
a
very
very
old
book
written
in
strange
characters
these
characters
appeared
to
dance
before
my
eyes
almost
as
though
they
lived
she
shuddered
slightly
then
the
same
iron
box
but
open
stood
upon
the
table
and
a
number
of
other
smaller
boxes
around
it
each
of
these
boxes
was
of
a
different
material
some
were
wooden
one
i
think
was
of
ivory
one
was
of
silver
and
one
of
some
dull
metal
which
might
have
been
gold
in
the
chair
by
the
table
antony
was
sitting
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
me
with
such
a
strange
expression
that
i
awoke
trembling
frightfully
cairn
nodded
again
and
last
night
he
prompted
last
night
continued
myra
with
a
note
of
trouble
in
her
sweet
voice
at
four
points
around
this
table
stood
four
smaller
lamps
and
upon
the
floor
were
rows
of
characters
apparently
traced
in
luminous
paint
they
flickered
up
and
then
grew
dim
then
flickered
up
again
in
a
sort
of
phosphorescent
way
they
extended
from
lamp
to
lamp
so
as
entirely
to
surround
the
table
and
the
chair
in
the
chair
antony
ferrara
was
sitting
he
held
a
wand
in
his
right
hand
a
wand
with
several
copper
rings
about
it
his
left
hand
rested
upon
the
iron
box
in
my
dream
although
i
could
see
this
all
very
clearly
i
seemed
to
see
it
from
a
distance
yet
at
the
same
time
i
stood
apparently
close
by
the
tables
i
can
not
explain
but
i
could
hear
nothing
only
by
the
movements
of
his
lips
could
i
tell
that
he
was
speaking
or
chanting
she
looked
across
at
cairn
as
if
fearful
to
proceed
but
presently
continued
suddenly
i
saw
a
frightful
shape
appear
on
the
far
side
of
the
circle
that
is
to
say
the
table
was
between
me
and
this
shape
it
was
just
like
a
grey
cloud
having
the
vague
outlines
of
a
man
but
with
two
eyes
of
red
fire
glaring
out
from
it
horribly
oh
horribly
it
extended
its
shadowy
arms
as
if
saluting
antony
he
turned
and
seemed
to
question
it
then
with
a
look
of
ferocious
anger
oh
it
was
frightful
he
dismissed
the
shape
and
began
to
walk
up
and
down
beside
the
table
but
never
beyond
the
lighted
circle
shaking
his
fists
in
the
air
and
to
judge
by
the
movements
of
his
lips
uttering
most
awful
imprecations
he
looked
gaunt
and
ill
i
dreamt
no
more
but
awoke
conscious
of
a
sensation
as
though
some
dead
weight
which
had
been
pressing
upon
me
had
been
suddenly
removed
cairn
glanced
across
at
his
son
significantly
but
the
subject
was
not
renewed
throughout
breakfast
breakfast
concluded
come
into
the
library
rob
said
cairn
i
have
to
spare
and
there
are
some
matters
to
be
discussed
he
led
the
way
into
the
library
with
its
orderly
rows
of
obscure
works
its
store
of
forgotten
wisdom
and
pointed
to
the
red
leathern
armchair
as
robert
cairn
seated
himself
and
looked
across
at
his
father
who
sat
at
the
big
that
scene
reminded
him
of
many
dangers
met
and
overcome
in
the
past
for
the
library
at
street
was
associated
in
his
mind
with
some
of
the
blackest
pages
in
the
history
of
antony
ferrara
do
you
understand
the
position
rob
asked
the
doctor
abruptly
i
think
so
sir
this
i
take
it
is
his
last
card
this
outrageous
ungodly
thing
which
he
has
loosed
upon
us
cairn
nodded
grimly
the
exact
frontier
he
said
dividing
what
we
may
term
hypnotism
from
what
we
know
as
sorcery
has
yet
to
be
determined
and
to
which
territory
the
doctrine
of
elemental
spirits
belongs
it
would
be
purposeless
at
the
moment
to
discuss
we
may
note
however
remembering
with
whom
we
are
dealing
that
the
chapter
of
the
ancient
egyptian
of
the
is
entitled
chapter
of
knowing
the
spirits
of
the
west
forgetting
that
we
dwell
in
the
twentieth
century
and
looking
at
the
situation
from
the
point
of
view
say
of
eliphas
l√©vi
cornelius
agrippa
or
the
abb√©
de
villars
the
man
whom
we
know
as
antony
ferrara
is
directing
against
this
house
and
those
within
it
a
type
of
elemental
spirit
known
as
a
salamander
robert
cairn
smiled
slightly
ah
said
the
doctor
with
an
answering
smile
in
which
there
was
little
mirth
we
are
accustomed
to
laugh
at
this
medi√¶val
terminology
but
by
what
other
can
we
speak
of
the
activities
of
ferrara
sometimes
i
think
that
we
are
the
victims
of
a
common
madness
said
his
son
raising
his
hand
to
his
head
in
a
manner
almost
pathetic
we
are
the
victims
of
a
common
enemy
replied
his
father
sternly
he
employs
weapons
which
often
enough
in
this
enlightened
age
of
ours
have
condemned
poor
souls
as
sane
as
you
or
i
to
the
madhouse
why
in
god
name
he
cried
with
a
sudden
excitement
does
science
persistently
ignore
all
those
laws
which
can
not
be
examined
in
the
laboratory
will
the
day
never
come
when
some
true
man
of
science
shall
endeavour
to
explain
the
movements
of
a
table
upon
which
a
ring
of
hands
has
been
placed
will
no
exact
scientist
condescend
to
examine
the
properties
of
a
will
no
one
do
for
the
phenomena
termed
what
newton
did
for
that
of
the
falling
apple
ah
rob
in
some
respects
this
is
a
darker
age
than
those
which
bear
the
stigma
of
darkness
silence
fell
for
a
few
moments
between
them
then
one
thing
is
certain
said
robert
cairn
deliberately
we
are
in
danger
in
the
greatest
danger
antony
ferrara
realising
that
we
are
bent
upon
his
destruction
is
making
a
final
stupendous
effort
to
compass
ours
i
know
that
you
have
placed
certain
seals
upon
the
windows
of
this
house
and
that
after
dusk
these
windows
are
never
opened
i
know
that
imprints
strangely
like
the
imprints
of
may
be
seen
at
this
moment
upon
the
casements
of
myra
room
your
room
my
room
and
elsewhere
i
know
that
myra
dreams
are
not
ordinary
meaningless
dreams
i
have
had
other
evidence
i
do
want
to
analyse
these
things
i
confess
that
my
mind
is
not
capable
of
the
task
i
do
not
even
want
to
know
the
meaning
of
it
all
at
the
present
moment
i
only
want
to
know
one
thing
is
antony
ferrara
cairn
stood
up
and
turning
faced
his
son
the
time
has
come
he
said
when
that
question
which
you
have
asked
me
so
many
times
before
shall
be
answered
i
will
tell
you
all
i
know
and
leave
you
to
form
your
own
opinion
for
ere
we
go
any
further
i
assure
you
that
i
do
not
know
for
certain
who
he
is
you
have
said
so
before
sir
will
you
explain
what
you
mean
when
his
adoptive
father
sir
michael
ferrara
resumed
the
doctor
beginning
to
pace
up
and
down
the
library
when
sir
michael
and
i
were
in
egypt
in
the
winter
of
we
conducted
certain
inquiries
in
the
fay√ªm
we
camped
for
over
three
months
beside
the
m√©yd√ªm
pyramid
the
object
of
our
inquiries
was
to
discover
the
tomb
of
a
certain
queen
i
will
not
trouble
you
with
the
details
which
could
be
of
no
interest
to
anyone
but
an
egyptologist
i
will
merely
say
that
apart
from
the
name
and
titles
by
which
she
is
known
to
the
ordinary
student
this
queen
is
also
known
to
certain
inquirers
as
the
she
was
not
an
egyptian
but
an
asiatic
in
short
she
was
the
last
high
priestess
of
a
cult
which
became
extinct
at
her
death
her
secret
mark
i
am
not
referring
to
a
cartouche
or
anything
of
that
kind
was
a
spider
it
was
the
mark
of
the
religion
or
cult
which
she
practised
the
high
priest
of
the
principal
temple
of
ra
during
the
reign
of
the
pharaoh
who
was
this
queen
husband
was
one
hortotef
this
was
his
official
position
but
secretly
he
was
also
the
of
the
sinister
creed
to
which
i
have
referred
the
temple
of
this
religion
a
religion
allied
to
black
magic
was
the
pyramid
of
m√©yd√ªm
so
much
we
knew
or
ferrara
knew
and
imparted
to
me
but
for
any
corroborative
evidence
of
this
cult
existence
we
searched
in
vain
we
explored
the
interior
of
the
pyramid
foot
by
foot
inch
by
inch
and
found
nothing
we
knew
that
there
was
some
other
apartment
in
the
pyramid
but
in
spite
of
our
soundings
measurements
and
laborious
excavations
we
did
not
come
upon
the
entrance
to
it
the
tomb
of
the
queen
we
failed
to
discover
also
and
therefore
concluded
that
her
mummy
was
buried
in
the
secret
chamber
of
the
pyramid
we
had
abandoned
our
quest
in
despair
when
excavating
in
one
of
the
neighbouring
mounds
we
made
a
discovery
he
opened
a
box
of
cigars
selected
one
and
pushed
the
box
towards
his
son
robert
shook
his
head
almost
impatiently
but
cairn
lighted
the
cigar
ere
resuming
directed
as
i
now
believe
by
a
malignant
will
we
blundered
upon
the
tomb
of
the
high
priest
you
found
his
mummy
we
found
his
mummy
yes
but
owing
to
the
carelessness
and
the
fear
of
the
native
labourers
it
was
exposed
to
the
sun
and
crumpled
was
lost
i
would
a
similar
fate
had
attended
the
other
one
which
we
found
what
another
mummy
we
discovered
cairn
spoke
very
deliberately
a
certain
papyrus
the
translation
of
this
is
contained
he
rested
the
point
of
his
finger
upon
the
in
the
unpublished
book
of
sir
michael
ferrara
which
lies
here
that
book
rob
will
never
be
published
now
furthermore
we
discovered
the
mummy
of
a
child
a
child
a
boy
not
daring
to
trust
the
natives
we
removed
it
secretly
at
night
to
our
own
tent
before
we
commenced
the
task
of
unwrapping
it
sir
michael
the
most
brilliant
scholar
of
his
age
had
proceeded
so
far
in
deciphering
the
papyrus
that
he
determined
to
complete
his
reading
before
we
proceeded
further
it
contained
directions
for
performing
a
certain
process
this
process
had
reference
to
the
mummy
of
the
child
do
i
understand
already
you
are
discrediting
the
story
ah
i
can
see
it
but
let
me
finish
unaided
we
performed
this
process
upon
the
embalmed
body
of
the
child
then
in
accordance
with
the
directions
of
that
dead
magician
that
accursed
malignant
being
who
thus
had
sought
to
secure
for
himself
a
new
tenure
of
evil
life
we
laid
the
mummy
treated
in
a
certain
fashion
in
the
king
chamber
of
the
m√©yd√ªm
pyramid
it
remained
there
for
thirty
days
from
moon
to
moon
you
guarded
the
entrance
you
may
assume
what
you
like
rob
but
i
could
swear
before
any
jury
that
no
one
entered
the
pyramid
throughout
that
time
yet
since
we
were
only
human
we
may
have
been
deceived
in
this
i
have
only
to
add
that
when
at
the
rising
of
the
new
moon
in
the
ancient
sothic
month
of
panoi
we
again
entered
the
chamber
a
living
baby
some
six
months
old
perfectly
healthy
solemnly
blinked
up
at
the
lights
which
we
held
in
our
trembling
hands
cairn
reseated
himself
at
the
table
and
turned
the
chair
so
that
he
faced
his
son
with
the
smouldering
cigar
between
his
teeth
he
sat
a
slight
smile
upon
his
lips
now
it
was
robert
turn
to
rise
and
begin
feverishly
to
pace
the
floor
you
mean
sir
that
this
infant
which
lay
in
the
pyramid
was
adopted
by
sir
michael
was
adopted
yes
sir
michael
engaged
nurses
for
him
reared
him
here
in
england
educating
him
as
an
englishman
sent
him
to
a
public
school
sent
him
to
to
oxford
antony
ferrara
what
do
you
seriously
tell
me
that
this
is
the
history
of
antony
ferrara
on
my
word
of
honour
boy
that
is
all
i
know
of
antony
ferrara
is
it
not
enough
merciful
god
it
is
incredible
groaned
robert
cairn
from
the
time
that
he
attained
to
manhood
said
cairn
evenly
this
adopted
son
of
my
poor
old
friend
has
passed
from
crime
to
crime
by
means
which
are
beyond
my
comprehension
and
which
alone
serve
to
confirm
his
supernatural
origin
he
has
acquired
knowledge
according
to
the
ancient
egyptian
beliefs
the
or
magical
powers
of
a
adept
at
the
death
of
the
body
could
enter
into
anything
prepared
for
its
reception
according
to
these
ancient
beliefs
then
the
of
the
high
priest
hortotef
entered
into
the
body
of
this
infant
who
was
his
son
and
whose
mother
was
the
and
in
this
modern
london
a
wizard
of
ancient
egypt
armed
with
the
lost
lore
of
that
magical
land
walks
amongst
us
what
that
lore
is
worth
it
would
be
profitless
for
us
to
discuss
but
that
he
possesses
it
of
it
i
know
beyond
doubt
the
most
ancient
and
most
powerful
magical
book
which
has
ever
existed
was
the
of
he
walked
across
to
a
distant
shelf
selected
a
volume
opened
it
at
a
particular
page
and
placed
it
on
his
son
knees
read
there
he
said
pointing
the
words
seemed
to
dance
before
the
younger
man
eyes
and
this
is
what
he
read
to
read
two
pages
enables
you
to
enchant
the
heavens
the
earth
the
abyss
the
mountains
and
the
sea
you
shall
know
what
the
birds
of
the
sky
and
the
crawling
things
are
saying
and
when
the
second
page
is
read
if
you
are
in
the
world
of
ghosts
you
will
grow
again
in
the
shape
you
were
on
earth
heavens
whispered
robert
cairn
is
this
the
writing
of
a
madman
or
can
such
things
possibly
be
he
read
on
this
book
is
in
the
middle
of
the
river
at
koptos
in
an
iron
box
an
iron
box
he
muttered
an
iron
box
so
you
recognise
the
iron
box
jerked
cairn
his
son
read
on
in
the
iron
box
is
a
bronze
box
in
the
bronze
box
is
a
sycamore
box
in
the
sycamore
box
is
an
ivory
and
ebony
box
in
the
ivory
and
ebony
box
is
a
silver
box
in
the
silver
box
is
a
golden

and
in
that
is
the
book
it
is
twisted
all
round
with
snakes
and
scorpions
and
all
the
other
crawling
things
the
man
who
holds
the
of
said
cairn
breaking
the
silence
holds
a
power
which
should
only
belong
to
god
the
creature
who
is
known
to
the
world
as
antony
ferrara
holds
that
book
do
you
doubt
it
therefore
you
know
now
as
i
have
known
long
enough
with
what
manner
of
enemy
we
are
fighting
you
know
that
this
time
it
is
a
fight
to
the
death
he
stopped
abruptly
staring
out
of
the
window
a
man
with
a
large
photographic
camera
standing
upon
the
opposite
pavement
was
busily
engaged
in
focussing
the
house
what
is
this
muttered
robert
cairn
also
stepping
to
the
window
it
is
a
link
between
sorcery
and
science
replied
the
doctor
you
remember
ferrara
photographic
gallery
at
oxford
the
zenana
you
used
to
call
it
you
remember
having
seen
in
his
collection
photographs
of
persons
who
afterwards
came
to
violent
ends
i
begin
to
understand
thus
far
his
endeavours
to
concentrate
the
whole
of
the
evil
forces
at
his
command
upon
this
house
have
had
but
poor
results
having
merely
caused
myra
to
dream
strange
dreams
clairvoyant
dreams
instructive
dreams
more
useful
to
us
than
to
the
enemy
and
having
resulted
in
certain
marks
upon
the
outside
of
the
house
adjoining
the
windows
windows
which
i
have
sealed
in
a
particular
manner
you
understand
by
means
of
photographs
he
concentrates
in
some
way
malignant
forces
upon
certain
points
he
focusses
his
will
yes
the
man
who
can
really
control
his
will
rob
is
supreme
below
the
godhead
ferrara
can
almost
do
this
now
before
he
has
become
wholly
proficient
i
understand
sir
snapped
his
son
grimly
he
is
barely
of
age
boy
cairn
said
almost
in
a
whisper
in
another
year
he
would
menace
the
world
where
are
you
going
he
grasped
his
son
arm
as
robert
started
for
the
door
that
man
yonder
diplomacy
rob
guile
against
guile
let
the
man
do
his
work
which
he
does
in
all
innocence
follow
him
learn
where
his
studio
is
situated
and
from
that
point
proceed
to
learn
the
situation
of
ferrara
cried
his
son
excitedly
i

of
course
you
are
right

i

chapter
xxix
the
wizard
den
robert
cairn
entered
a
photographer
shop
in
baker
street
you
recently
arranged
to
do
views
of
some
houses
in
the
west
end
for
a
gentleman
he
said
to
the
girl
in
charge
that
is
so
she
replied
after
a
moment
hesitation
we
did
pictures
of
the
house
of
some
celebrated
specialist
for
a
magazine
article
they
were
intended
do
you
wish
us
to
do
something
similar
not
at
the
moment
replied
robert
cairn
smiling
slightly
i
merely
want
the
address
of
your
client
i
do
not
know
that
i
can
give
you
that
replied
the
girl
doubtfully
but
he
will
be
here
about
eleven
for
proofs
if
you
wish
to
see
him
i
wonder
if
i
can
confide
in
you
said
robert
cairn
looking
the
girl
frankly
in
the
eyes
she
seemed
rather
confused
i
hope
there
is
nothing
wrong
she
murmured
you
have
nothing
to
fear
he
replied
but
unfortunately
there
something
wrong
which
however
i
can
not
explain
will
you
promise
me
not
to
tell
your
client
i
do
not
ask
his
name
that
i
have
been
here
or
have
been
making
any
inquiries
respecting
him
i
think
i
can
promise
that
she
replied
i
am
much
indebted
to
you
robert
cairn
hastily
left
the
shop
and
began
to
look
about
him
for
a
likely
from
whence
unobserved
he
might
watch
the
photographer
an
antique
furniture
dealer
some
little
distance
along
on
the
opposite
side
attracted
his
attention
he
glanced
at
his
watch
it
was
ten
if
upon
the
pretence
of
examining
some
of
the
stock
he
could
linger
in
the
furniture
shop
for
he
would
be
enabled
to
get
upon
the
track
of
ferrara
his
mind
made
up
he
walked
along
and
entered
the
shop
for
the
next
he
passed
from
item
to
item
of
the
collection
displayed
there
surveying
each
in
the
leisurely
manner
of
a
connoisseur
but
always
he
kept
a
watch
through
the
window
upon
the
establishment
beyond
promptly
at
eleven
a
taxi
cab
drew
up
at
the
door
and
from
it
a
slim
man
alighted
he
wore
despite
the
heat
of
the
morning
an
overcoat
of
some
woolly
material
and
in
his
gait
as
he
crossed
the
pavement
to
enter
the
shop
there
was
something
revoltingly
effeminate
a
sort
of
grace
which
had
been
noticeable
in
a
woman
but
which
in
a
man
was
unnatural
and
for
some
obscure
reason
sinister
it
was
antony
ferrara
even
at
that
distance
and
in
that
brief
time
robert
cairn
could
see
the
ivory
face
the
abnormal
red
lips
and
the
long
black
eyes
of
this
arch
fiend
this
monster
masquerading
as
a
man
he
had
much
ado
to
restrain
his
rising
passion
but
knowing
that
all
depended
upon
his
cool
action
he
waited
until
ferrara
had
entered
the
photographer
with
a
word
of
apology
to
the
furniture
dealer
he
passed
quickly
into
baker
street
everything
rested
now
upon
his
securing
a
cab
before
ferrara
came
out
again
ferrara
cabman
evidently
was
waiting
for
him
a
taxi
driver
fortunately
hailed
cairn
at
the
very
moment
that
he
gained
the
pavement
and
cairn
concealing
himself
behind
the
vehicle
gave
the
man
rapid
instructions
you
see
that
taxi
outside
the
photographer
he
said
the
man
nodded
wait
until
someone
comes
out
of
the
shop
and
is
driven
off
in
it
then
follow
do
not
lose
sight
of
the
cab
for
a
moment
when
it
draws
up
and
wherever
it
draws
up
drive
right
past
it
do
attract
attention
by
stopping
you
understand
quite
sir
said
the
man
smiling
slightly
and
cairn
entered
the
cab
the
cabman
drew
up
at
a
point
some
little
distance
beyond
from
whence
he
could
watch
two
minutes
later
ferrara
came
out
and
was
driven
off
the
pursuit
commenced
his
cab
ahead
proceeded
to
westminster
bridge
across
to
the
south
side
of
the
river
and
by
way
of
that
commercial
thoroughfare
at
the
back
of
thomas
hospital
emerged
at
vauxhall
thence
the
pursuit
led
to
stockwell
herne
hill
and
yet
onward
towards
dulwich
it
suddenly
occurred
to
robert
cairn
that
ferrara
was
making
in
the
direction
of
saunderson
house
at
dulwich
common
the
house
in
which
myra
had
had
her
mysterious
illness
in
which
she
had
remained
until
it
had
become
evident
that
her
safety
depended
upon
her
never
being
left
alone
for
one
moment
what
can
be
his
object
muttered
cairn
he
wondered
if
ferrara
for
some
inscrutable
reason
was
about
to
call
upon
saunderson
but
when
the
cab
ahead
having
passed
the
park
continued
on
past
the
lane
in
which
the
house
was
situated
he
began
to
search
for
some
other
solution
to
the
problem
of
destination
suddenly
he
saw
that
the
cab
ahead
had
stopped
the
driver
of
his
own
cab
without
slackening
speed
pursued
his
way
cairn
crouched
down
upon
the
floor
fearful
of
being
observed
no
house
was
visible
to
right
nor
left
merely
open
fields
and
he
knew
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
delay
in
such
a
spot
without
attracting
attention
ferrara
cab
passed
keep
on
till
i
tell
you
to
stop
cried
cairn
he
dropped
the
and
turning
looked
out
through
the
little
window
at
the
back
ferrara
had
dismissed
his
cab
he
saw
him
entering
a
gate
and
crossing
a
field
on
the
right
of
the
road
cairn
turned
again
and
took
up
the
tube
stop
at
the
first
house
we
come
to
he
directed
hurry
presently
a
building
was
reached
a
large
straggling
house
which
obviously
had
no
tenant
here
the
man
pulled
up
and
cairn
leapt
out
as
he
did
so
he
heard
ferrara
cab
driving
back
by
the
way
it
had
come
here
he
said
and
gave
the
man
half
a
sovereign
wait
for
me
he
started
back
along
the
road
at
a
run
even
had
he
suspected
that
he
was
followed
ferrara
could
not
have
seen
him
but
when
cairn
came
up
level
with
the
gate
through
which
ferrara
had
gone
he
slowed
down
and
crept
cautiously
forward
ferrara
who
by
this
time
had
reached
the
other
side
of
the
field
was
in
the
act
of
entering
a
building
which
evidently
at
some
time
had
formed
a
portion
of
a
farm
as
the
distant
figure
opening
one
of
the
big
doors
disappeared
within
the
place
of
which
myra
has
been
dreaming
muttered
cairn
certainly
viewed
from
that
point
it
seemed
to
answer
externally
to
the
girl
description
the
roof
was
of
red
tiles
and
cairn
could
imagine
how
the
moonlight
would
readily
find
access
through
the
chinks
which
beyond
doubt
existed
in
the
structure
he
had
little
doubt
that
this
was
the
place
dreamt
of
or
seen
clairvoyantly
by
myra
that
this
was
the
place
to
which
ferrara
had
retreated
in
order
to
conduct
his
nefarious
operations
it
was
eminently
suited
to
the
purpose
being
entirely
surrounded
by
unoccupied
land
for
what
ostensible
purpose
ferrara
has
leased
it
he
could
not
conjecture
nor
did
he
concern
himself
with
the
matter
the
purpose
for
which
actually
he
had
leased
the
place
was
sufficiently
evident
to
the
man
who
had
suffered
so
much
at
the
hands
of
this
modern
sorcerer
to
approach
closer
would
have
been
indiscreet
this
he
knew
and
he
was
sufficiently
diplomatic
to
resist
the
temptation
to
obtain
a
nearer
view
of
the
place
he
knew
that
everything
depended
upon
secrecy
antony
ferrara
must
not
suspect
that
his
black
laboratory
was
known
cairn
decided
to
return
to
street
without
delay
fully
satisfied
with
the
result
of
his
investigation
he
walked
rapidly
back
to
where
the
cab
waited
gave
the
man
his
father
address
and
in
of
an
hour
was
back
in
street
cairn
had
not
yet
dismissed
the
last
of
his
patients
myra
accompanied
by
miss
saunderson
was
out
shopping
and
robert
found
himself
compelled
to
possess
his
soul
in
patience
he
paced
restlessly
up
and
down
the
library
sometimes
taking
a
book
at
random
scanning
its
pages
with
unseeing
eyes
and
replacing
it
without
having
formed
the
slightest
impression
of
its
contents
he
tried
to
smoke
but
his
pipe
was
constantly
going
out
and
he
had
littered
the
hearth
untidily
with
burnt
matches
when
cairn
suddenly
opened
the
library
door
and
entered
well
he
said
eagerly
robert
cairn
leapt
forward
i
have
tracked
him
sir
he
cried
my
god
while
myra
was
at
saunderson
she
was
almost
next
door
to
the
beast
his
den
is
in
a
field
no
more
than
a
thousand
yards
from
the
garden
wall
from
saunderson
he
is
daring
muttered
cairn
but
his
selection
of
that
site
served
two
purposes
the
spot
was
suitable
in
many
ways
and
we
were
least
likely
to
look
for
him
as
it
were
it
was
a
move
characteristic
of
the
accomplished
criminal
robert
cairn
nodded
it
is
the
place
of
which
myra
dreamt
sir
i
have
not
the
slightest
doubt
about
that
what
we
have
to
find
out
is
at
what
times
of
the
day
and
night
he
goes
there
i
doubt
interrupted
cairn
if
he
often
visits
the
place
during
the
day
as
you
know
he
has
abandoned
his
rooms
in
piccadilly
but
i
have
no
doubt
knowing
his
sybaritic
habits
that
he
has
some
other
palatial
place
in
town
i
have
been
making
inquiries
in
several
directions
especially
in
certain
directions
he
paused
raising
his
eyebrows
significantly
additions
to
the
zenana
inquired
robert
cairn
nodded
his
head
grimly
exactly
he
replied
there
is
not
a
scrap
of
evidence
upon
which
legally
he
could
be
convicted
but
since
his
return
from
egypt
rob
he
has
added
other
victims
to
the
list
the
fiend
cried
the
younger
man
the
unnatural
fiend
unnatural
is
the
word
he
is
literally
unnatural
but
many
women
find
him
irresistible
he
is
typical
of
the
unholy
brood
to
which
he
belongs
the
evil
beauty
of
the
sent
many
a
soul
to
perdition
the
evil
beauty
of
her
son
has
zealously
carried
on
the
work
what
must
we
do
i
doubt
if
we
can
do
anything
obviously
the
early
morning
is
the
most
suitable
time
to
visit
his
den
at
dulwich
common
but
the
new
photographs
of
the
house
there
will
be
another
attempt
upon
us
yes
there
will
be
another
attempt
upon
us
said
the
doctor
wearily
this
is
the
year
yet
here
in
street
when
dusk
falls
we
shall
be
submitted
to
an
attack
of
a
kind
to
which
mankind
probably
has
not
been
submitted
for
many
ages
we
shall
be
called
upon
to
dabble
in
the
despised
magical
art
we
shall
be
called
upon
to
place
certain
seals
upon
our
doors
and
windows
to
protect
ourselves
against
an
enemy
who
like
eros
laughs
at
locks
and
bars
is
it
possible
for
him
to
succeed
quite
possible
rob
in
spite
of
all
our
precautions
i
feel
in
my
very
bones
that
he
will
put
forth
a
supreme
effort
a
bell
rang
i
think
continued
the
doctor
that
this
is
myra
she
must
get
all
the
sleep
she
can
during
the
afternoon
for
i
have
determined
that
she
and
you
and
i
must
not
think
of
sleep
but
must
remain
together
here
in
the
library
we
must
not
lose
sight
of
one
another
you
understand
i
am
glad
that
you
have
proposed
it
cried
robert
cairn
eagerly
i
too
feel
that
we
have
come
to
a
critical
moment
in
the
contest
continued
the
doctor
i
shall
be
prepared
to
take
certain
steps
my
preparations
will
occupy
me
throughout
the
rest
of
chapter
xxx
the
elemental
at
dusk
that
evening
cairn
his
son
and
myra
duquesne
met
together
in
the
library
the
girl
looked
rather
pale
an
odour
of
incense
pervaded
the
house
coming
from
the
study
wherein
he
had
locked
himself
early
in
the
evening
issuing
instructions
that
he
was
not
to
be
disturbed
the
exact
nature
of
the
preparations
which
he
had
been
making
robert
cairn
was
unable
to
conjecture
and
some
instinct
warned
him
that
his
father
would
not
welcome
any
inquiry
upon
the
matter
he
realised
that
cairn
proposed
to
fight
antony
ferrara
with
his
own
weapons
and
now
when
something
in
the
very
air
of
the
house
seemed
to
warn
them
of
a
tremendous
attack
impending
that
the
doctor
much
against
his
will
was
entering
the
arena
in
the
character
of
a
practical
magician
a
character
new
to
him
and
obviously
abhorrent
at
ten
the
servants
all
retired
in
accordance
with
cairn
orders
from
where
he
stood
by
the
tall
robert
cairn
could
watch
myra
duquesne
a
dainty
picture
in
her
simple
where
she
sat
reading
in
a
distant
corner
her
delicate
beauty
forming
a
strong
contrast
to
the
background
of
sombre
volumes
cairn
sat
by
the
big
table
smoking
and
apparently
listening
a
strange
device
which
he
had
adopted
every
evening
for
the
past
week
he
had
adopted
again
there
were
little
white
seals
bearing
a
curious
figure
consisting
in
interlaced
triangles
upon
the
insides
of
every
window
in
the
house
upon
the
doors
and
even
upon
the
robert
cairn
at
another
time
might
have
thought
his
father
mad
childish
thus
to
play
at
wizardry
but
he
had
had
experiences
which
had
taught
him
to
recognise
that
upon
such
seemingly
trivial
matters
great
issues
might
turn
that
in
the
strange
land
over
the
border
there
were
stranger
laws
laws
which
he
could
but
dimly
understand
there
he
acknowledged
the
superior
wisdom
of
cairn
and
did
not
question
it
at
eleven
a
comparative
quiet
had
come
upon
street
the
sound
of
the
traffic
had
gradually
subsided
until
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
house
stood
not
in
the
busy
west
end
of
london
but
isolated
apart
from
its
neighbours
it
seemed
to
him
an
abode
marked
out
and
separated
from
the
other
abodes
of
man
a
house
enveloped
in
an
impalpable
cloud
a
cloud
of
evil
summoned
up
and
directed
by
the
wizard
hand
of
antony
ferrara
son
of
the
although
myra
pretended
to
read
and
cairn
from
his
fixed
expression
might
have
been
supposed
to
be
in
point
of
fact
they
were
all
waiting
with
nerves
at
highest
tension
for
the
opening
of
the
attack
in
what
form
it
would
come
whether
it
would
be
vague
moanings
and
tappings
upon
the
windows
such
as
they
had
already
experienced
whether
it
would
be
a
phantasmal
storm
a
clap
of
phenomenal
thunder
they
could
not
conjecture
if
the
enemy
would
attack
suddenly
or
if
his
menace
would
grow
threatening
from
afar
off
and
then
gradually
penetrating
into
the
heart
of
the
garrison
it
came
then
suddenly
and
dramatically
dropping
her
book
myra
uttered
a
piercing
scream
and
with
eyes
glaring
madly
fell
forward
on
the
carpet
unconscious
robert
cairn
leapt
to
his
feet
with
clenched
fists
his
father
stood
up
so
rapidly
as
to
overset
his
chair
which
fell
crashingly
upon
the
floor
together
they
turned
and
looked
in
the
direction
in
which
the
girl
had
been
looking
they
fixed
their
eyes
upon
the
drapery
of
the
library
window
which
was
drawn
together
the
whole
window
was
luminous
as
though
a
bright
light
shone
outside
but
luminous
as
though
that
light
were
the
light
of
some
unholy
fire
involuntarily
they
both
stepped
back
and
robert
cairn
clutched
his
father
arm
convulsively
the
curtains
seemed
to
be
rendered
transparent
as
if
some
powerful
ray
were
directed
upon
them
the
window
appeared
through
them
as
a
rectangular
blue
patch
only
two
lamps
were
burning
in
the
library
that
in
the
corner
by
which
myra
had
been
reading
and
the
green
shaded
lamp
upon
the
table
the
best
end
of
the
room
by
the
window
then
was
in
shadow
against
which
this
unnatural
light
shone
brilliantly
my
god
whispered
robert
cairn
that
street
outside
there
can
be
no
light
he
broke
off
for
now
he
perceived
the
thing
which
had
occasioned
the
girl
scream
of
horror
in
the
middle
of
the
rectangular
patch
of
light
a
grey
shape
but
partially
opaque
moved
shifting
luminous
clouds
about
it
was
taking
form
growing
momentarily
more
substantial
it
had
some
remote
semblance
of
a
man
but
its
unique
characteristic
was
its
awful
it
had
the
greyness
of
a
rain
cloud
yet
rather
that
of
a
column
of
smoke
and
from
the
centre
of
the
dimly
defined
head
two
eyes
balls
of
living
fire
glared
out
into
the
room
heat
was
beating
into
the
library
from
the
window
physical
heat
as
though
a
furnace
door
had
been
opened
and
the
shape
ever
growing
more
palpable
was
moving
forward
towards
them
approaching
the
heat
every
instant
growing
greater
it
was
impossible
to
look
at
those
two
eyes
of
fire
it
was
almost
impossible
to
move
indeed
robert
cairn
was
transfixed
in
such
horror
as
in
all
his
dealings
with
the
monstrous
ferrara
he
had
never
known
before
but
his
father
shaking
off
the
dread
which
possessed
him
also
leapt
at
one
bound
to
the
library
table
robert
cairn
vaguely
perceived
that
a
small
group
of
objects
looking
like
balls
of
wax
lay
there
cairn
had
evidently
been
preparing
them
in
the
locked
study
now
he
took
them
all
up
in
his
left
hand
and
confronted
the
thing
which
seemed
to
be
into
the
room
for
it
did
not
advance
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
word
one
by
one
he
threw
the
white
pellets
into
that
vapoury
greyness
as
they
touched
the
curtain
they
hissed
as
if
they
had
been
thrown
into
a
fire
they
melted
and
upon
the
transparency
of
the
drapings
as
upon
a
sheet
of
gauze
showed
faint
streaks
where
melting
they
trickled
down
the
tapestry
as
he
cast
each
pellet
from
his
hand
cairn
took
a
step
forward
and
cried
out
certain
words
in
a
loud
voice
words
which
robert
cairn
knew
he
had
never
heard
uttered
before
words
in
a
language
which
some
instinct
told
him
to
be
ancient
egyptian
their
effect
was
to
force
that
dreadful
shape
gradually
to
disperse
as
a
cloud
of
smoke
might
disperse
when
the
fire
which
occasions
it
is
extinguished
slowly
seven
pellets
in
all
he
threw
towards
the
window
and
the
seventh
struck
the
curtains
now
once
more
visible
in
their
proper
form
the
fire
elemental
had
been
vanquished
robert
cairn
clutched
his
hair
in
a
sort
of
frenzy
he
glared
at
the
draped
window
feeling
that
he
was
making
a
supreme
effort
to
retain
his
sanity
had
it
ever
looked
otherwise
had
the
tapestry
ever
faded
before
him
becoming
visible
in
a
great
light
which
had
shone
through
it
from
behind
had
the
thing
a
thing
unnameable
indescribable
stood
there
he
read
his
answer
upon
the
tapestry
whitening
streaks
showed
where
the
pellets
melting
had
trickled
down
the
curtain
lift
myra
on
the
settee
it
was
cairn
speaking
calmly
but
in
a
strained
voice
robert
cairn
as
if
emerging
from
a
mist
turned
to
the
recumbent
white
form
upon
the
carpet
then
with
a
great
cry
he
leapt
forward
and
raised
the
girl
head
myra
he
groaned
myra
speak
to
me
control
yourself
boy
rapped
cairn
sternly
she
can
not
speak
until
you
have
revived
her
she
has
swooned
nothing
worse
and
we
have
conquered
chapter
xxxi
the
book
of
thoth
the
mists
of
early
morning
still
floated
over
the
fields
when
these
two
set
upon
strange
business
walked
through
the
damp
grass
to
the
door
of
the
barn
radiated
the
deathly
waves
which
on
the
previous
night
had
reached
them
or
almost
reached
them
in
the
library
at
street
the
big
double
doors
were
padlocked
but
for
this
they
had
come
provided
ten
minutes
work
upon
the
padlock
sufficed
and
cairn
swung
wide
the
doors
a
suffocating
smell
the
smell
of
that
incense
with
which
they
had
too
often
come
in
contact
was
wafted
out
to
them
there
was
a
dim
light
inside
the
place
and
without
hesitation
both
entered
a
deal
table
and
chair
constituted
the
sole
furniture
of
the
interior
a
part
of
the
floor
was
roughly
boarded
and
a
brief
examination
of
the
boarding
sufficed
to
discover
the
hiding
place
in
which
antony
ferrara
kept
the
utensils
of
his
awful
art
cairn
lifted
out
two
heavy
boards
and
in
a
recess
below
lay
a
number
of
singular
objects
there
were
four
antique
lamps
of
most
peculiar
design
there
was
a
larger
silver
lamp
which
both
of
them
had
seen
before
in
various
apartments
occupied
by
antony
ferrara
there
were
a
number
of
other
things
which
robert
cairn
could
not
have
described
had
he
been
called
upon
to
do
so
for
the
reason
that
he
had
seen
nothing
like
them
before
and
had
no
idea
of
their
nature
or
purpose
but
conspicuous
amongst
this
curious
hoard
was
a
square
iron
box
of
workmanship
dissimilar
from
any
workmanship
known
to
robert
cairn
its
lid
was
covered
with
a
sort
of
scroll
work
and
he
was
about
to
reach
down
in
order
to
lift
it
out
when
do
not
touch
it
cried
the
doctor
for
god
sake
do
not
touch
it
robert
cairn
started
back
as
though
he
had
seen
a
snake
turning
to
his
father
he
saw
that
the
latter
was
pulling
on
a
pair
of
white
gloves
as
he
fixed
his
eyes
upon
these
in
astonishment
he
perceived
that
they
were
smeared
all
over
with
some
white
preparation
stand
aside
boy
said
the
doctor
and
for
once
his
voice
shook
slightly
do
not
look
again
until
i
call
to
you
turn
your
head
aside
silent
with
amazement
robert
cairn
obeyed
he
heard
his
father
lift
out
the
iron
box
he
heard
him
open
it
for
he
had
already
perceived
that
it
was
not
locked
then
quite
distinctly
he
heard
him
close
it
again
and
replace
it
in
the
do
not
turn
boy
came
a
hoarse
whisper
he
did
not
turn
but
waited
his
heart
beating
painfully
for
what
should
happen
next
stand
aside
from
the
door
came
the
order
and
when
i
have
gone
out
do
not
look
after
me
i
will
call
to
you
when
it
is
finished
he
obeyed
without
demur
his
father
passed
him
and
he
heard
him
walking
through
the
damp
grass
outside
the
door
of
the
barn
there
followed
an
intolerable
interval
from
some
place
not
very
distant
he
could
hear
cairn
moving
hear
the
chink
of
glass
upon
glass
as
though
he
were
pouring
out
something
from
a
stoppered
bottle
then
a
faint
acrid
smell
was
wafted
to
his
nostrils
perceptible
even
above
the
heavy
odour
of
the
incense
from
the
barn
relock
the
door
came
the
cry
robert
cairn
reclosed
the
door
snapped
the
padlock
fast
and
began
to
fumble
with
the
skeleton
keys
with
which
they
had
come
provided
he
discovered
that
to
reclose
the
padlock
was
quite
as
difficult
as
to
open
it
his
hands
were
trembling
too
he
was
all
anxiety
to
see
what
had
taken
place
behind
him
so
that
when
at
last
a
sharp
click
told
of
the
task
accomplished
he
turned
in
a
flash
and
saw
his
father
placing
tufts
of
grass
upon
a
charred
patch
from
which
a
faint
haze
of
smoke
still
arose
he
walked
over
and
joined
him
what
have
you
done
sir
i
have
robbed
him
of
his
armour
replied
the
doctor
grimly
his
face
was
very
pale
his
eyes
were
very
bright
i
have
destroyed
the
of
then
he
will
be
unable
he
will
still
be
able
to
summon
his
dreadful
servant
rob
having
summoned
him
once
he
can
summon
him
again
but
well
sir
he
can
not
control
him
good
god
that
night
brought
no
repetition
of
the
uncanny
attack
and
in
the
grey
half
light
before
the
dawn
cairn
and
his
son
themselves
like
two
phantoms
again
crept
across
the
field
to
the
barn
the
padlock
hung
loose
in
the
ring
stay
where
you
are
rob
cautioned
the
doctor
he
gently
pushed
the
door
open
wider
wider
and
looked
in
there
was
an
overpowering
odour
of
burning
flesh
he
turned
to
robert
and
spoke
in
a
steady
voice
the
brood
of
the
is
extinct
he
said
by
the
same
author
the
mystery
of
the
devil
doctor
the
mysteries
the
yellow

of

of
