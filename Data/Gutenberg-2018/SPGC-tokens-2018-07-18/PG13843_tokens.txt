cold
they

it
when

has
a

which
has
been
rejected

and
miserable

nobody
wanted

had
better
luck
he
comes
bringing
fuel

provisions
they
all
prepare
their
meal
when
the
landlord
enters
and
demands
the
payment
of
his
rent
the
friends
offer
him
a
glass
of
wine
and
turn
him
out
amidst
joking
and
laughter
after
their
gay
repast
they
separate
and
rudolph
remains
alone
writing
a
knock
is
heard
at
the
door
and
mimi
a
little
seamstress
who
lives
on
the
same
floor
appears
and
asks
rudolph
to
give
her
a
match
to
light
her
candle
as
she
is
about
to
go
out
she
falls
in
a
faint
rudolph
gives
her
wine
and
restores
her
to
consciousness
she
tells
him
that
she
suffers
from
consumption
rudolph
is
struck
by
her
beauty
and
her
delicate
hands
she
notices
that
she
has
lost
her
key
and
whilst
they
search
for
it
their
candles
are
extinguished
as
they
grope
on
the
floor
in
the
dark
rudolph
finds
the
key
and
puts
it
in
his
pocket
their
hands
meet
and
rudolph
tries
to
warm
her
hands
and
tells
her
all
about
his
life
mimi
confides
her
struggles
to
him
and
their
conversation
soon
turns
upon
their
love
for
each
other
act
ii

have
repaired

their
favorite
café

are
seen
entering
a
milliner
where

away
she
makes
peace
with

the

act
iii
months
have
elapsed

and
misery
to

loves

gates
of
paris

meets

and
jealousy
explaining

she
must
leave

mimi
cough
betrays

says
to

the
spring
meanwhile
musetta
and
marcel
have
a
violent
quarrel
act
iv
marcel
and
rudolph
are
now
living
together
in
their
musetta
and
mimi
have
left
them
they
are
seemingly
working
but
their
thoughts
wander
towards
the
women
they
love
schaunard
and
colline
enter
with
rolls
and
a
herring
for
their
meal
they
have
a
wild
time
and
are
dancing
and
singing
when
musetta
enters
and
tells
them
that
mimi
is
outside
so
weak
and
ill
that
she
can
go
no
further
they
make
up
a
bed
on
the
couch
for
her
and
bring
her
in
she
clings
to
rudolph
and
implores
him
not
to
leave
her
mimi
reconciles
marcel
and
musetta
musetta
tells

old
friends
that

is
dying
and
gives

her
earrings
to
sell
asking

to
get
a
doctor

go
out

falls
back
in
a
faint

medicine

regains
consciousness
and
turning
to
rudolph
tells
him
of
her
love
musetta
falls
upon
her
knees
in
prayer
and
mimi
passes
away
in
rudolph
arms
rain
or
dust
cold
or
heat
nothing
stops
these
bold
adventurers
their
existence
of
every
day
is
a
work
of
genius
a
daily
problem
which
they
always
contrive
to
solve
with
the
aid
of
bold
mathematics
when
want
presses
them
abstemious
as
anchorites
but
if
a
little
fortune
falls
into
their
hands
see
them
ride
forth
on
the
most
ruinous
fancies
loving
the
fairest
and
youngest
drinking
the
oldest
and
best
wines
and
not
finding
enough
windows
whence
to
throw
their
money
then
the
last
crown
dead
and
buried
they
begin
again
to
dine
at
the
table
of
chance
where
their
cover
is
always
laid
smugglers
of
all
the
industries
which
spring
from
art
in
chase
from
morning
till
night
of
that
wild
animal
which
is
called
the
crown
bohemia
has
a
special
dialect
a
distinct
jargon
of
its
own
this
vocabulary
is
the
hell
of
rhetoric
and
the
paradise
of
gay
life
yet
a
terrible
il
murger
preface
to
vie
de
bohème
footnote
rather
than
follow
murger
novel
step
by
step
the
authors
of
the
present
libretto
both
for
reasons
of
musical
and
dramatic
effect
have
sought
to
derive
inspiration
from
the
french
writer
admirable
preface
although
they
have
faithfully
portrayed
the
characters
even
displaying
a
certain
fastidiousness
as
to
sundry
local
details
albeit
in
the
scenic
development
of
the
opera
they
have
followed
method
of
dividing
the
libretto
into
four
separate
acts
in
the
dramatic
and
comic
episodes
they
have
claimed
that
ample
and
entire
freedom
of
action
which
rightly
or
wrongly
they
deemed
necessary
to
the
proper
scenic
presentment
of
a
novel
the
most
free
perhaps
in
modern
literature
yet
in
this
strange
book
if
the
characters
of
each
person
therein
stand
out
clear
and
sharply
defined
we
often
may
perceive
that
one
and
the
same
temperament
bears
different
names
and
that
it
is
incarnated
so
to
speak
in
two
different
persons
who
can
not
detect
in
the
delicate
profile
of
one
woman
the
personality
both
of
mimi
and
of
francine
who
as
he
reads
of
mimi
little
hands
whiter
than
those
of
the
goddess
of
ease
is
not
reminded
of
francine
little
muff
the
authors
deem
it
their
duty
to
point
out
this
identity
of
character
it
has
seemed
to
them
that
these
two
mirthful
fragile
and
unhappy
creatures
in
this
comedy
of
bohemian
life
might
haply
figure
as
one
person
whose
name
should
not
be
mimi
not
francine
but
the
ideal
act
i
mimi
was
a
charming
girl
specially
apt
to
appeal
to
rudolph
the
poet
and
dreamer
aged
she
was
slight
and
graceful
her
face
reminded
one
of
some
sketch
of
beauty
its
features
had
marvellous
refinement
the
hot
impetuous
blood
of
youth
coursed
through
her
veins
giving
a
rosy
hue
to
her
clear
complexion
that
had
the
white
velvety
bloom
of
the
camellia
this
frail
beauty
allured
rudolph
but
what
wholly
served
to
enchant
him
were
mimi
tiny
hands
that
despite
her
household
duties
she
contrived
to
keep
whiter
even
than
the
goddess
of
ease
act
i
in
the
attic
window
from
which
one
sees
an
expanse
of
roofs
on

a
fireplace

pensively
out
of

marcel

his
painting
the
passage
of
the
red
sea
with
hands
nipped
with
cold
and
warms
them
by
blowing
on
them
from
time
to
time

changing

of
the
mar

to
this

as
damp
and
chill
to
me
as
if

back

stream

flowing
a
little
way

easel

mimi
voice
seemed
to
go
through

heart
like
a
his
love
for
her
was
a
jealous
fantastic
weird
hysterical
love
scores
of
times
they
were
on
the
point
of
separating
it
must
be
admitted
that
their
existence
was
a
veritable
thus
if
life
it
was
did
they
live
a
few
happy
days
alternating
with
many
wretched
ones
while
perpetually
awaiting
a
divorce
either
as
a
congenital
defect
or
as
a
natural
instinct
musetta
possessed
a
positive
genius
for
elegance
even
in
her
cradle
this
strange
creature
must
surely
have
asked
for
a
mirror
intelligent
shrewd
and
above
all
hostile
to
anything
that
she
considered
tyranny
she
had
but
one
rule
caprice
in
truth
the
only
man
that
she
really
loved
was
marcel
perhaps
because
he
alone
could
make
her
suffer
yet
extravagance
was
for
her
one
of
the
conditions
of

whisper
together

and
then
rejoins
his
companions
interrupting
bids

a
book
upright
on
the
table
so
as
to
shade
the
here

should
be
a
shade
because
the

his
turn
goes
up
to
the
bed
and
retreats
in
alarm

ray
of
sunshine
falls
through
the
window
upon
mimi
face
musetta
points
to
her
cloak
which
with
a
grateful
glance
rudolph
takes
and
standing
upon
a
chair
endeavors
to
form
a
screen
by
stretching
the
cloak
across
the
entering
and
putting
some
money
on
the
table
near
how
is
she
rud
see
now
she
tranquil
turning
round
sees
musetta
who
makes
a
sign
to
him
that
the
medicine
is
ready
getting
off
the
chair
he
is
suddenly
aware
of
the
strange
demeanor
of
marcel
and
rud
almost
in
a
speaking
what
the
meaning
of
this
going
and
this
coming
and
these
glances
so
strange
glances
from
one
to
the
other
in
mar
to
bear
up

himself
on

lifts
her
up
shakes
her
by

and
exclaims
in
tones
of
mimi

falls
sobbing
upon
her
lifeless
rushes
to
the
bed

a
piercing
cry
of
grief

kneels
sobbing
at
the
foot
of
the

sinks
back
into
a
chair
to

stands
at
the
foot
of

dazed
at
the
suddenness
of
this
catastrophe
