two
switch
lights
twinkled
one
at
the
east
and
one
at
the
west
end
of
the
siding
for
the
rest
all
was
blackness
half
way
between
the
switch
lights
snuggled
close
against
the
main
line
the
station
little
more
than
a
shanty
and
too
insignificant
to
boast
a
night
operator
loomed
up
shadowy
and
indistinct
away
to
the
westward
like
jagged
points
sticking
up
into
the
night
and
standing
out
in
relief
against
the
skyline
the
rockies
reared
their
peaks
and
the
spell
of
the
brooding
mountains
seemed
to
lie
over
all
the
desolate
surrounding
all
was
utter
silence
and
then
there
came
a
sound
low
at
first
like
a
strange
muttering
from
somewhere
to
the
westward
it
died
away
grew
louder
was
hushed
broke
into
a
sustained
roar
came
then
the
quick
short
gasps
of
the
was
a
freight
and
a
heavy
one
and
suddenly
from
up
the
track
circling
an
intervening
butte
an
electric
headlight
cut
streaming
through
the
black
it
touched
the
little
station
in
a
queerly
inquisitive
way
in
the
sweep
of
its
arc
lingered
an
instant
over
the
platform
then
swung
to
the
right
of
way
and
held
there
the
metals
glistening
like
polished
silver
ribbons
under
the
flood
of
light
straining
panting
at
its
load
reddening
the
sky
as
the
door
was
flung
open
the
big
tenwheeler
stormed
by
coughing
the
sparks
heavenward
from
its
stack
the
roar
in
the
still
night
grew
deafening
as
boxcar
flat
and
gondola
lurching
swaying
clanking
groaning
an
endless
string
tugging
at
one
another
grinding
their
flanges
screaming
as
they
took
up
the
axle
play
staggered
with
a
din
infernal
past
the
lonely
and
unlighted
station
the
roar
sank
into
a
gradually
diminishing
murmur
the
winked
like
mischievous
little
red
eyes
in
the
vanished
all
was
stillness
and
that
brooding
silence
again
and
then
a
man
form
like
a
black
shadow
in
the
darkness
rose
from
the
trackside
and
crept
to
the
platform
and
along
the
platform
to
the
station
door
the
man
bent
forward
and
the
round
white
ray
of
a
pocket
flashlight
played
upon
the
lock
he
examined
the
lock
for
an
instant
appraisingly
then
drew
a
bunch
of
skeleton
keys
from
his
pocket
and
selecting
one
of
the
number
without
hesitation
unlocked
the
door
stepped
inside
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
the
flashlight
swept
in
a
circle
around
the
interior
of
the
little
station
there
were
but
two
small
waiting
room
which
he
had
entered
and
in
which
he
now
stood
and
partitioned
off
from
this
the
door
open
a
still
smaller
inner
room
the
agent
office
he
moved
at
once
into
the
latter
and
his
flashlight
swiftly
now
searched
around
the
walls
and
held
upon
the
clock
it
was
six
minutes
to
ten
pretty
close
work
muttered
the
man
six
minutes
to
the
ray
travelled
now
over
the
operator
table
and
from
the
table
to
the
switchboard
he
reached
out
cut
in
the
office
circuit
listened
for
an
instant
as
the
sounder
began
to
the
ray
swept
over
the
table
again
under
a
newspaper
that
the
day
man
had
apparently
flung
down
at
haphazard
on
leaving
the
office
he
found
a
pad
of
telegraph
blanks
from
which
evidently
wary
of
the
consequences
of
using
a
pad
with
its
resultant
impressions
on
the
under
sheets
he
tore
off
a
sheet
and
laid
it
down
ready
to
hand
before
him
this
done
he
nodded
complacently
sat
down
in
the
operator
chair
tilted
the
chair
back
put
his
feet
up
on
the
table
and
coolly
picked
up
the
newspaper
it
was
the
evening
edition
of
the
selkirk
city
journal
that
had
presumably
been
tossed
off
at
the
station
by
a
charitable
train
crew
of
some
late
afternoon
train
out
from
the
city
he
held
the
paper
in
one
hand
the
flashlight
in
the
other
scanned
the
page
which
happened
to
be
an
inner
one
cursorily
turned
it
over
and
suddenly
leaned
forward
a
little
in
his
seat
he
was
staring
at
the
headline
at
the
top
corner
of
the
front
page
notorious
criminal
released
from
sing
sing
police
are
warned
that
man
may
be
in
this
vicinity
harry
maul
alias
the
hawk
known
to
be
in
the
west
the
telegraph
sounder
chattered
volubly
for
an
instant
as
though
to
challenge
and
silence
the
raucous
ticking
of
the
clock
and
ended
in
a
splutter
of
wrath
as
it
were
at
the
futility
of
its
attempt
the
clock
ticked
on
there
was
no
other
sound
and
then
the
man
spoke
aloud
that
me
he
said
the
the
paper
rattled
in
his
hand
there
was
a
twisted
smile
on
his
lips
in
the
darkness
i
guess
i
pretty
well
the
hawk
eyes
fixed
on
the
text
and
he
began
to
read
it
is
reported
that
harry
maul
better
known
to
the
police
as
the
hawk
forger
and
thief
one
of
the
cleverest
crooks
in
the
country
who
is
at
large
again
after
a
penitentiary
term
is
somewhere
in
the
west
the
crime
wave
that
has
recently
been
sweeping
over
selkirk
city
and
its
vicinity
and
particularly
the
daring
and
in
too
many
cases
successful
outrages
with
which
the
railroad
officials
and
detectives
have
been
called
upon
to
cope
of
late
may
as
a
very
plausible
theory
have
lured
the
hawk
here
as
to
a
promising
field
in
which
to
resume
his
criminal
operations
certain
it
is
that
while
we
have
been
the
victims
of
a
band
of
mysterious
desperadoes
for
some
time
past
the
last
week
or
so
has
seen
a
very
marked
increase
in
the
number
of
crimes
that
have
been
significant
coincidence
with
the
hawk
release
from
sing
sing
a
diamond
necklace
was
stolen
from
a
private
car
two
nights
ago
there
was
an
express
car
robbery
on
monday
of
this
week
and
a
sleeping
car
was
thoroughly
and
systematically
looted
the
night
before
true
it
is
mere
conjecture
to
connect
the
hawk
with
these
in
any
way
since
the
gang
that
has
been
operating
in
this
neighbourhood
has
proved
itself
quite
capable
of
all
and
more
than
this
without
any
outside
and
highly
specialised
assistance
and
it
would
appear
is
in
no
whit
inferior
in
resource
and
devilish
ingenuity
to
the
best
or
worst
that
sing
sing
has
to
offer
in
the
shape
of
this
hawk
but
out
of
conjecture
one
question
naturally
suggests
itself
granting
the
presence
of
the
hawk
is
he
here
as
a
rival
of
the
criminals
of
whose
existence
we
are
already
only
too
well
aware
or
is
he
one
of
them
through
associations
before
sing
sing
put
a
temporary
check
upon
his
activities
there
was
virulent
outpouring
of
wrath
at
the
intolerable
extent
to
which
the
community
its
life
and
property
was
being
endangered
and
a
promise
of
summary
vengeance
upon
the
criminals
if
caught
quite
so
murmured
the
hawk
lowering
his
feet
slowly
to
the
floor
i
guess
it
would
be
healthy
to
get
caught
around
these
parts
i
have
a
feeling
that
it
would
be
the
nearest
telegraph
pole
instead
of
a
trial
he
tossed
the
newspaper
back
on
the
table
the
sounder
spasmodic
in
its
chatter
for
the
moment
was
still
all
was
silence
profound
absolute
then
the
clock
struck
loud
resonant
smashing
through
the
silence
startling
and
at
the
same
instant
the
sounder
broke
into
a
quick
tattoo
the
hawk
snatched
a
pencil
from
his
pocket
and
jerked
his
body
relaxed
again
stray
stuff
he
muttered
got
in
ahead
of
him
we
get
it
in
a
minute
pencil
poised
in
his
hand
the
flashlight
playing
on
the
blank
sheet
of
paper
before
him
the
hawk
waited
the
sounder
almost
instantly
broke
again
rattling
sharply
through
the
room
the
hawk
nodded
as
his
pencil
began
to
travel
across
the
paper
at
five
tonight
he
said
aloud
without
pause
without
hesitation
without
the
slightest
indication
of
spacing
to
break
its
continuity
the
sounder
rattled
finally
as
abruptly
as
it
had
begun
it
stopped
on
the
sheet
of
paper
the
hawk
had
written
this

he
reached
out
for
the
pad
tore
off
another
sheet
and
in
two
parallel
columns
set
down
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
one
column
transposed
there
was
a
faint
smile
on
his
lips
as
he
turned
again
to
the
cipher
and
began
to
write
in
another
line
of
letters
under
the
original
message
i
wonder
what
poe
and
his
predominant
would
do
with
this
he
chuckled
two
key
he
frowned
the
next
instant
what
this
three
instead
of
he
completed
the
transposition
stared
at
the
several
lines
which
were
now
scattered
with
vertically
letters
whistled
low
under
his
breath
and
a
grim
look
settled
on
his
face
the
message
now
read
mechanically
he
separated
words
and
sentences
and
eliminating
the
superfluous
letters
wrote
out
the
translation
at
the
bottom
of
the
sheet
combination
in
upper
drawer
left
side
divisional
paymaster
desk
ten
thousand
in
safe
put
number
one
on
the
hawk
stood
up
plugged
out
the
station
circuit
and
gathering
up
the
two
sheets
of
paper
he
had
used
put
them
in
his
pocket
then
leaving
the
door
of
the
operator
room
open
behind
him
as
he
had
found
it
he
stepped
out
from
the
station
to
the
platform
and
with
his
skeleton
key
relocked
the
station
door
he
stood
for
a
moment
staring
up
and
down
the
track
the
switchlights
blinked
back
at
him
confidentially
he
listened
the
eastbound
freight
from
which
he
had
jumped
some
twenty
minutes
before
would
cross
extra
no
the
westbound
way
freight
at
elkton
seven
miles
away
but
there
was
no
sound
of
the
latter
as
yet
he
turned
then
and
jumping
from
the
platform
to
the
track
swung
into
a
along
the
roadbed
the
hawk
smiled
contentedly
to
himself
it
was
all
timed
to
a
nicety
a
mile
or
so
to
the
west
the
right
of
way
rose
in
a
stiff
grade
that
the
way
freight
would
be
able
to
negotiate
at
no
better
speed
than
the
pace
at
which
a
man
could
crawl
he
could
make
the
distance
readily
board
her
there
and
the
way
freight
would
get
him
to
the
divisional
paymaster
office
about
midnight
he
ran
on
the
swing
and
ease
of
a
trained
athlete
in
his
stride
and
as
he
ran
he
took
the
sheets
of
paper
from
his
pocket
and
tearing
them
into
small
fragments
scattered
the
pieces
at
intervals
here
and
there
he
reached
the
foot
of
the
grade
and
paused
to
look
back
along
the
track
as
suddenly
from
behind
him
came
the
hoarse
scream
of
an
engine
whistle
that
was
the
way
freight
now
whistling
perfunctorily
for
the
deserted
station
he
had
made
the
grade
in
plenty
of
time
though
the
nearer
to
the
top
he
could
get
the
better
for
the
freight
requiring
all
the
initial
impetus
it
could
attain
would
hit
the
foot
of
the
grade
wide
open
the
hawk
broke
into
a
run
again
glancing
constantly
back
over
his
shoulder
as
he
sped
on
up
the
grade
and
then
when
he
was
well
on
toward
the
summit
opening
the
night
like
a
blazing
disk
as
it
rounded
a
curve
he
caught
the
gleam
of
the
headlight
it
grew
larger
and
larger
until
beginning
to
fling
a
luminous
pathway
up
the
track
that
gradually
lengthening
crept
nearer
and
nearer
to
him
he
swerved
suddenly
plunged
down
the
embankment
and
well
away
from
the
trackside
dropped
flat
upon
the
ground
the
engine
slowed
was
grunting
heavily
on
the
incline
as
it
strained
by
the
spot
where
he
lay
there
was
the
glimmer
of
the
brakeman
lamp
from
the
top
of
one
of
the
forward
with
a
quick
appraising
glance
to
measure
the
length
of
the
train
the
hawk
on
hands
and
knees
crawled
forward
and
up
the
embankment
and
in
the
shadow
of
the
rolling
cars
themselves
stood
up
there
would
be
sharp
eyes
watching
from
the
cupola
of
the
caboose
he
laughed
a
little
and
not
only
the
train
crew
there
perhaps
the
railroad
detectives
at
their
wits
ends
had
acquired
the
habit
of
late
of
turning
up
in
the
most
unexpected
places
a
boxcar
rolled
by
him
another
and
still
the
eyes
were
fixed
a
little
further
along
toward
the
rear
on
an
open
space
where
in
the
darkness
a
flat
car
gave
the
appearance
of
a
break
in
the
train
the
flat
car
came
abreast
of
him
he
caught
the
iron
jumped
and
with
a
powerful
muscular
swing
flung
himself
aboard
the
car
was
loaded
with
some
kind
of
carriage
or
wagon
the
hawk
crawled
in
under
the
tarpaulin
and
lay
down
upon
his
back
pillowing
his
head
on
a
piece
of
timber
that
blocked
the
carriage
wheels
the
train
topped
the
grade
gained
speed
and
roared
on
through
the
night
occasionally
during
what
was
close
to
a
run
it
stopped
at
intermediate
stations
and
the
hawk
peered
furtively
out
from
under
the
tarpaulin
to
locate
the
surroundings
with
which
he
appeared
to
be
intimately
familiar
and
once
nearing
the
end
of
the
run
as
the
glow
from
the
city
lights
in
the
distance
showed
under
the
shadows
of
the
towering
peaks
he
spoke
aloud
ten
thousand
dollars
remarked
the
hawk
pleasantly
nice
picking
for
a
few
hours
thousand
dollars
counterfeit
note
the
hawk
crawled
out
from
under
the
tarpaulin
and
dropped
to
the
ground
as
the
freight
slowing
down
began
to
patter
in
over
the
spur
switches
of
the
selkirk
yard
he
darted
bent
low
across
several
spurs
to
escape
the
possibility
of
observation
from
the
freight
caboose
then
began
to
make
his
way
toward
the
roundhouse
ahead
of
him
he
would
have
to
pass
around
behind
the
roundhouse
in
order
to
get
up
opposite
the
station
and
the
divisional
offices
the
hawk
glanced
sharply
about
him
as
he
moved
along
he
dodged
here
and
there
like
some
queer
irresponsible
phantom
flitting
amongst
the
low
myriad
red
green
and
purple
lights
that
dotted
the
yard
and
he
carefully
avoided
those
other
lights
the
white
lights
of
the
yardsmen
now
bobbing
as
the
men
ran
up
and
down
now
swinging
from
the
footboard
of
a
passing
switcher
that
seemed
to
be
unusually
the
hawk
was
secretive
and
for
certain
good
and
valid
reasons
was
possessed
of
an
earnest
desire
that
no
stranger
should
be
reported
prowling
around
the
railroad
yard
that
night
he
reached
the
roundhouse
stepped
close
up
against
the
wall
to
take
advantage
of
the
security
afforded
by
the
shadows
and
began
to
circle
the
building
the
hawk
was
treading
silently
now
halfway
around
the
building
he
halted
abruptly
his
head
cocked
suddenly
in
a
listening
attitude
toward
a
small
open
and
lighted
window
on
a
level
with
his
shoulders
and
in
order
to
pass
which
he
had
just
been
on
the
point
of
stooping
down
i
think
said
the
hawk
softly
to
himself
i
think
this
sounds
as
though
it
interested
he
crept
cautiously
forward
and
from
the
edge
of
the
window
glanced
inside
it
was
the
turner
cubbyhole
or
office
the
door
was
closed
and
two
men
were
standing
there
talking
earnestly
the
hawk
face
dimly
outlined
now
in
the
window
light
the
eyes
and
forehead
hidden
by
the
brim
of
the
slouch
hat
that
was
pulled
forward
almost
to
the
bridge
of
his
nose
set
with
a
curious
and
significant
smile
it
was
not
a
bad
place
for
a
private
conference
he
had
thought
he
had
recognised
the
he
had
not
been
mistaken
the
big
man
was
macvightie
the
head
of
the
railroad
detective
force
the
other
a
smaller
man
with
alert
grey
eyes
his
forehead
furrowed
anxiously
whose
clenched
hand
rested
on
the
table
was
lanson
the
division
superintendent
i
do
know
damn
it
macvightie
lanson
was
saying
savagely
i
do
know
what
to
think
or
only
know
that
a
pullman
one
night
a
necklace
stolen
the
next
an
express
car
looted
and
several
other
little
pleasant
episodes
all
jammed
one
on
top
of
the
other
means
hell
to
pay
out
here
and
nothing
to
pay
it
with
unless
we
can
do
something
almighty
quick
any
more
of
those
messages
inquired
was
an
ominous
abstraction
in
his
tones
make
anything
of
it
no
said
lanson
and
i
think
it
about
time
to
put
a
kink
in
that
little
business
whether
they
mean
anything
or
not
this
game
we
been
playing
we
get
back
to
that
in
a
minute
interrupted
macvightie
quietly
here
a
little
something
else
that
may
possibly
fit
into
the
he
reached
into
his
pocket
took
out
his
pocketbook
opened
it
and
handed
the
division
superintendent
a
crisp
new
note
the
hawk
lips
thinned
instantly
and
he
swore
sharply
under
his
breath
what
this
asked
lanson
in
surprise
phony
said
macvightie
laconically
counterfeit
lanson
turned
the
note
over
in
his
hands
staring
at
first
one
side
and
then
the
other
are
you
sure
i
take
it
any
you
have
lots
of
company
with
you
was
a
sudden
rasp
in
the
detective
voice
pretty
good
one
is
it
the
east
is
being
flooded
with
them
two
of
them
showed
up
in
the
banks
here
in
the
city
yesterday
and
one
lanson
frowned
perplexedly
i
do
get
you
macvightie
he
said
suppose
they
were
being
struck
off
around
here
suggested
macvightie
curtly
i
do
say
they
are
but
suppose
it
were
so
they
likely
be
shoved
out
as
far
away
from
this
locality
as
possible
would
east
say
they
so
good
that
a
jag
of
them
got
by
before
they
began
to
be
now
suppose
we
assume
that
they
beginning
to
sift
back
around
the
well
well
caught
the
superintendent
up
i
did
say
i
could
prove
it
but
coupled
with
the
fact
that
i
happen
to
know
that
the
police
have
traced
the
work
back
to
somewhere
west
of
chicago
i
got
a
hunch
that
the
gang
that
is
operating
around
here
and
the
crowd
that
is
turning
out
the
phony
money
is
the
same
outfit
the
lord
knows
smiled
they
clever
enough
and
to
go
back
to
those
messages
now
if
there
was
anything
in
them
at
all
anything
more
than
some
irresponsible
idiot
tampering
with
a
key
somewhere
we
were
face
to
face
not
with
a
mere
gang
of
train
robbers
but
with
an
organised
criminal
league
as
dangerous
and
powerful
as
has
ever
existed
in
this
that
what
made
me
hesitate
we
could
afford
to
take
any
chances
to
start
out
after
a
nest
and
we
had
to
make
as
nearly
sure
of
our
ground
as
possible
before
we
played
a
card
we
went
on
the
principle
that
if
it
was
only
somebody
playing
the
goat
he
get
tired
of
it
before
long
if
no
one
paid
any
attention
to
him
if
it
meant
anything
more
than
that
he
keep
macvightie
pugnacious
face
screwed
up
into
a
savage
grimace
well
maybe
this
counterfeiting
idea
has
had
something
to
do
with
deciding
me
but
anyway
i
satisfied
now
he
has
kept
on
and
satisfied
now
that
those
messages
are
a
cipher
code
that
the
gang
is
using
and
that
our
play
as
you
call
it
instead
of
being
abortive
is
exactly
what
going
to
land
our
men
for
us
one
thing
i
came
to
tell
you
i
ready
now
to
take
the
gloves
off
on
this
wire
lanson
smashed
his
fist
down
on
the
table
top
good
he
exclaimed
grimly
i
like
to
make
things
hot
for
somebody
and
it
at
least
be
easy
enough
to
catch
whoever
is
using
the
macvightie
shook
his
head
oh
no
it
wo
he
said
evenly
i
did
mean
to
give
you
that
impression
and
do
you
make
the
mistake
of
the
brains
we
up
against
lanson
i
no
expert
on
telegraphy
that
your
end
of
it
but
i
know
they
would
sit
in
on
any
game
where
they
did
hold
trumps
up
their
sleeves
get
me
now
see
what
it
looks
like
as
i
understand
it
these
messages
no
matter
from
what
point
on
the
division
they
are
sent
would
be
heard
on
every
sounder
on
the
right
is
it
of
course
agreed
lanson
and
it
might
be
an
operator
working
with
them
as
an
inside
man
or
with
the
necessary
outfit
the
wire
could
be
tapped
at
any
point
could
it
yes
said
lanson
but
the
minute
he
starts
in
we
could
begin
to
him
go
on
invited
macvightie
i
we
could
tell
whether
he
was
working
east
or
west
of
any
given
point
explained
the
superintendent
and
with
the
operators
instructed
beforehand
practically
narrow
him
down
to
say
between
two
the
hawk
as
he
too
listened
permitted
an
amused
smile
to
flicker
across
his
lips
um
said
macvightie
and
would
he
be
aware
that
this
process
was
going
on
admitted
lanson
we
ca
prevent
macvightie
shook
his
head
again
that
does
sound
good
to
me
he
said
slowly
all
have
to
do
would
be
to
beat
it
the
next
time
start
in
fifty
miles
away
and
you
have
to
begin
all
over
again
and
besides
who
receiving
the
messages
you
ca
put
any
tabs
on
that
every
sounder
from
selkirk
city
to
rainy
river
registers
them
and
all
a
man
got
to
do
is
listen
you
see
lanson
it
not
so
lanson
frowned
well
what
do
you
suggest
he
asked
uncomfortably
we
can
stop
but
we
do
want
to
stop
it
returned
macvightie
we
could
have
done
that
from
the
first
what
we
want
is
our
man
now
and
it
strikes
me
that
the
first
thing
to
do
is
to
find
out
whether
one
of
our
own
operators
is
in
on
this
or
not
unless
the
line
is
tapped
somewhere
it
a
cinch
that
a
station
key
is
being
used
is
it
send
some
linemen
that
you
can
trust
over
the
division
if
they
find
anything
at
all
they
find
the
spot
where
the
messages
are
coming
from
they
if
they
find
nothing
we
know
we
got
to
look
nearer
our
own
lanson
in
his
turn
shook
his
head
not
necessarily
he
objected
we
a
number
of
small
stations
where
there
no
night
operator
they
might
have
got
into
one
of
those
the
messages
all
come
through
at
well
i
call
the
turn
there
responded
with
a
short
laugh
see
that
i
get
a
list
of
those
stations
in
the
morning
and
i
detail
men
to
take
care
of
that
end
of
the
hawk
drew
back
a
little
shifting
his
strained
amused
smile
was
no
longer
on
his
lips
and
as
for
that
business
went
on
go
slow
with
it
till
you
get
your
linemen
report
do
do
any
more
than
try
it
out
with
some
operator
you
can
absolutely
depend
upon
say
about
halfway
down
the
line
you
say
you
would
be
able
to
tell
whether
the
messages
were
coming
from
east
or
west
of
that
point
cut
the
division
in
half
for
us
as
far
as
our
search
is
concerned
and
that
worth
taking
a
chance
on
but
do
overdo
it
lanson
we
do
want
to
throw
any
scare
into
all
right
agreed
lanson
i
start
things
moving
martin
at
bald
creek
will
be
the
best
man
i
guess
i
send
a
letter
down
to
him
on
no
and
warn
him
to
make
no
reports
by
wire
cautioned
macvightie
all
naturally
agreed
the
superintendent
again
then
after
a
short
pause
anxiously
anything
turned
up
at
all
macvightie
any
clue
to
that
necklace
the
governor
wife
is
making
a
holler
that
reached
from
here
to
the
road
directors
down
in
wall
damn
it
growled
macvightie
i
well
enough
aware
of
the
necklace
is
any
more
important
than
any
one
of
the
other
affairs
is
it
no
there
a
blamed
thing
well
what
about
this
sing
sing
convict
the
hawk
that
the
papers
are
featuring
lanson
asked
anything
in
that
i
do
mcvightie
answered
viciously
only
one
more
anyway
this
gang
was
operating
before
he
was
it
likely
enough
if
they
old
pals
of
his
that
he
come
out
here
to
give
them
a
hand
the
new
york
police
say
he
went
to
chicago
immediately
after
his
release
two
weeks
ago
the
chicago
police
reported
him
there
and
then
he
disappeared
then
denver
spotted
him
a
few
days
that
the
last
that
been
seen
of
him
you
can
make
what
you
like
of
that
he
certainly
been
hitting
a
pretty
straight
trail
west
he
was
stopped
of
course
because
he
is
at
present
he
only
a
man
with
a
bad
record
and
labelled
dangerous
we
were
warned
to
look
out
for
him
that
got
his
description
inquired
lanson
yes
laugh
was
a
short
bark
medium
height
muscular
black
hair
black
eyes
straight
nose
and
gentlemanly
in
appearance
and
manner
dresses
well
age
to
no
distinctive
marks
or
there
probably
not
more
than
thousand
men
in
selkirk
city
who
would
answer
to
every
detail
of
that
lanson
commented
sarcastically
exactly
admitted
macvightie
and
the
hawk
was
creeping
forward
again
in
the
shadows
of
the
roundhouse
yes
i
guess
it
interested
me
muttered
the
hawk
i
guess
it
did
i
guess
i
playing
in
luck
paymaster
safe
from
the
roundhouse
it
was
only
a
few
yards
to
the
rear
of
the
long
freight
sheds
and
unobserved
the
hawk
gained
this
new
shelter
he
stole
quickly
along
to
the
further
end
of
the
sheds
and
there
crouched
down
again
in
the
shadows
halted
to
make
a
critical
survey
of
his
surroundings
just
in
front
of
him
divided
only
by
a
sort
of
driveway
for
the
convenience
of
the
teamsters
was
the
end
wall
of
the
station
and
in
the
end
window
of
the
divisional
paymaster
office
the
hawk
glanced
to
his
left
the
street
upon
which
the
station
fronted
an
section
of
the
city
was
dark
dimly
lighted
and
deserted
the
only
sign
of
life
being
the
lighted
windows
of
a
saloon
on
the
corner
of
a
narrow
lane
that
bisected
the
block
of
somewhat
disreputable
wooden
structures
that
faced
the
station
to
his
right
on
the
other
side
of
the
freight
shed
the
railroad
yard
had
narrowed
down
to
the
station
tracks
and
a
single
spur
alongside
the
shed
there
was
no
one
in
sight
in
either
direction
the
hawk
eyes
strayed
back
to
the
paymaster
window
the
station
like
its
surrounding
neighbours
was
an
old
wooden
building
and
being
low
and
only
the
window
offered
inviting
possibilities
from
the
sill
of
the
lower
window
a
man
who
was
at
all
agile
had
the
upper
window
at
his
mercy
against
this
mode
of
attack
however
was
the
risk
of
being
seen
by
any
one
who
might
pass
along
the
street
or
by
any
one
who
might
chance
upon
the
end
of
the
station
platform
what
the
use
decided
the
hawk
with
an
abrupt
shrug
of
his
shoulders
play
safe
there
a
better
the
hawk
crept
across
the
driveway
reached
the
street
side
of
the
station
peered
cautiously
around
the
corner
of
the
building
and
satisfied
that
he
was
unobserved
edged
down
along
the
building
for
a
short
distance
paused
in
a
doorway
glanced
quickly
about
him
then
the
door
opened
and
closed
and
he
was
standing
in
a
murky
passageway
that
was
lighted
only
by
a
single
incandescent
far
back
by
a
stair
well
he
stood
motionless
listening
from
above
through
the
stillness
came
the
faint
drumming
of
a
telegraph
key
there
should
be
no
one
upstairs
now
but
the
dispatcher
whose
room
was
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
building
from
the
paymaster
possibly
with
the
dispatcher
a
call
boy
or
two
and
the
hallway
above
he
could
see
was
dark
moving
stealthily
forward
as
noiseless
as
a
cat
in
his
tread
the
hawk
took
a
mask
from
his
pocket
slipped
it
over
his
face
and
began
to
mount
the
stairs
he
gained
the
halted
again
it
was
pitch
black
here
since
even
the
door
of
the
dispatcher
room
where
there
would
be
a
light
was
closed
and
then
once
more
the
hawk
moved
an
instant
later
the
paymaster
door
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
corridor
under
the
deft
persuasion
of
his
skeleton
keys
had
closed
behind
him
it
was
not
quite
so
dark
here
the
lights
from
the
platform
and
the
yard
filtered
in
through
the
window
in
a
filmy
sort
of
way
but
it
was
too
dark
to
distinguish
objects
in
anything
more
than
grotesque
shapeless
outlines
the
hawk
produced
his
flashlight
and
turned
it
upon
the
lock
he
had
just
picked
it
was
a
spring
lock
opened
readily
from
the
inside
by
the
mere
turning
of
the
doorhandle
he
tried
it
carefully
assuring
himself
that
it
could
not
be
opened
from
the
corridor
without
a
then
his
light
swept
around
the
room
it
played
in
its
circuit
upon
the
paymaster
desk
against
the
wall
and
upon
a
large
safe
in
the
corner
near
the
window
whose
polished
nickel
dial
sent
back
an
answering
flash
under
the
darting
ray
but
the
hawk
for
the
moment
appeared
to
be
interested
in
neither
desk
nor
safe
the
flashlight
was
holding
in
a
kind
of
dogged
inquisitiveness
upon
another
door
close
to
the
window
and
directly
opposite
the
safe
he
stepped
without
a
sound
across
the
room
and
reaching
this
door
snapped
off
his
flashlight
he
tried
the
door
cautiously
found
it
unlocked
and
very
softly
opened
it
the
space
of
an
inch
he
listened
attentively
there
was
no
sound
he
pushed
the
door
open
switched
on
his
flashlight
again
and
stepped
through
the
doorway
it
appeared
to
be
a
clerks
the
paymaster
staff
presumably
the
hawk
seemed
to
possess
a
peculiar
penchant
for
doors
the
only
thing
in
the
room
that
apparently
held
any
interest
for
him
now
was
the
door
that
opened
like
the
paymaster
upon
the
corridor
he
slipped
quickly
across
the
room
and
as
before
examined
the
lock
like
the
other
it
was
a
spring
lock
and
like
the
other
he
tested
it
to
make
sure
it
was
locked
on
the
outside
ten
thousand
dollars
confided
the
hawk
to
the
lock
is
to
be
picked
up
every
night
and
we
ca
afford
to
take
any
chances
you
he
began
to
retrace
his
steps
toward
the
paymaster
office
but
now
obviously
with
more
attention
to
the
details
of
his
surroundings
for
his
flashlight
kept
dancing
quick
jerky
flashes
in
all
directions
about
him
ah
the
exclamation
came
suddenly
i
thought
there
ought
to
be
something
like
this
around
here
from
beside
a
desk
he
stooped
and
picked
up
an
empty
pay
satchel
then
returning
at
once
to
the
other
office
but
leaving
the
connecting
door
just
ajar
he
dropped
the
pay
bag
in
front
of
the
safe
and
went
silently
over
to
the
mouse
running
across
the
floor
would
have
made
more
commotion
than
the
hawk
had
made
since
his
entry
into
the
station
upper
drawer
left
side
he
muttered
locked
of
a
tiny
key
selected
from
its
fellow
outlaws
was
inserted
in
the
the
hawk
pulled
out
the
drawer
and
began
to
rummage
through
its
contents
from
the
back
of
the
drawer
after
perhaps
a
minute
search
he
picked
up
a
card
and
with
a
nod
of
satisfaction
began
to
study
it
right
one
three
the
hawk
eyes
travelled
swiftly
over
the
combination
he
read
it
over
again
thank
you
murmured
the
hawk
dropped
the
card
back
in
the
drawer
and
locked
the
drawer
a
moment
more
and
the
white
beam
of
the
flashlight
was
playing
on
the
face
of
the
safe
and
the
silence
of
the
room
was
broken
by
the
faint
musical
metallic
whirring
of
the
dial
bent
forward
a
crouching
form
in
the
darkness
the
hawk
worked
swiftly
a
sure
deft
accuracy
in
every
movement
of
his
fingers
with
a
low
thud
as
he
turned
the
handle
the
heavy
bolt
shot
back
in
its
grooves
and
the
ponderous
door
swung
open
and
now
the
flashlight
ray
flooded
the
interior
of
the
safe
and
the
hawk
laughed
him
lying
on
the
bottom
of
the
safe
neatly
banded
as
they
had
come
from
the
bank
were
a
dozen
or
fifteen
little
packages
of
banknotes
the
hawk
dropped
on
his
knees
and
reached
for
the
pay
bag
ten
thousand
dollars
was
not
so
bulky
after
the
denominations
of
the
notes
were
large
enough
he
riffled
one
package
through
his
gold
twenties
there
was
a
sort
of
beatific
smile
on
the
hawk
lips
he
dropped
the
package
into
the
bag
tens
and
twenties
and
light
in
a
curiously
caressing
way
was
lingering
on
the
little
fortune
as
it
lay
there
on
the
bottom
of
the
safe
there
was
only
a
pile
or
two
of
ones
and
the
rest
was
that
the
smile
vanished
from
the
hawk
lips
and
in
a
rigid
tense
strained
attitude
he
hung
there
motionless
what
was
dull
rasping
sound
it
was
like
some
one
clawing
at
the
wall
outside
the
window
with
a
single
motion
as
though
stirred
to
life
by
some
galvanic
shock
the
hawk
hand
shot
out
and
swept
the
packages
of
banknotes
into
the
bag
he
snapped
off
his
flashlight
the
room
was
in
darkness
that
sound
again
and
now
a
creak
the
window
was
being
opened
something
black
was
bulking
there
on
the
sill
something
queerly
white
a
man
face
was
pressed
against
the
pane
peering
in
the
hawk
glanced
sharply
around
him
inch
by
inch
he
was
pushing
the
safe
door
shut
he
could
not
reach
the
door
leading
to
the
office
for
he
would
have
to
pass
by
the
window
shrank
back
quickly
the
safe
door
closed
but
still
unlocked
and
crouched
low
in
the
corner
against
the
wall
the
window
slid
up
to
the
top
and
with
a
soft
pad
like
some
animal
alighting
on
the
floor
the
man
had
sprung
into
the
room
the
hawk
fingers
crept
into
his
pocket
and
out
again
now
upon
an
automatic
pistol
the
other
flashlight
winked
went
out
then
shot
across
the
room
locating
the
once
more
all
was
darkness
there
was
not
a
sound
now
save
the
short
hurried
breathing
of
the
other
panting
from
the
exertion
of
his
climb
then
the
man
step
squeaked
faintly
crossing
the
the
hawk
a
few
inches
at
a
time
began
to
edge
along
the
wall
away
from
the
neighbourhood
of
the
safe
then
the
man
flashlight
gleamed
again
lighting
up
the
top
of
the
desk
there
was
a
sharp
ripping
sound
as
of
the
tearing
of
wood
under
pressure
and
the
upper
drawer
forced
open
by
a
steel
jimmy
was
pulled
out
birds
of
a
feather
said
the
hawk
grimly
to
himself
number
one
of
the
wire
devils
i
did
beat
him
to
it
by
as
much
margin
as
i
thought
i
would
the
hawk
shifted
his
automatic
to
the
hand
that
was
clutching
the
pay
bag
and
with
the
other
hand
began
to
feel
in
wide
sweeps
over
the
wall
above
his
head
the
switch
he
had
noticed
in
that
first
quick
glance
when
he
had
entered
the
room
a
glance
that
had
seemed
to
notice
nothing
and
yet
in
which
nothing
had
escaped
the
sharp
trained
eyes
was
somewhere
about
here
both
of
it
seen
outside
communed
the
hawk
with
himself
again
but
when
he
finds
the
safe
unlocked
and
the
goods
gone
there
be
trouble
if
he
gets
a
flashlight
on
me
got
me
where
he
wants
me
it
is
the
hawk
fingers
touched
the
switch
he
lowered
the
pay
bag
cautiously
to
the
floor
between
his
feet
his
automatic
free
in
his
hand
again
there
was
a
rustling
of
papers
in
the
drawer
then
the
man
hand
holding
a
card
was
outlined
as
though
thrown
upon
a
screen
as
with
his
other
hand
he
focused
his
flashlight
upon
it
then
the
flashlight
swung
an
arc
over
the
opposite
wall
and
pointed
a
pathway
to
the
safe
as
the
man
turned
abruptly
and
stepped
back
across
the
room
the
hawk
one
hand
raised
to
the
switch
on
the
wall
his
automatic
outflung
a
little
in
the
other
tense
like
an
animal
in
leash
watched
the
other
movements
the
form
was
in
shadowy
relief
against
the
light
that
played
now
upon
the
glistening
knob
and
dial
of
the
safe
the
man
gave
a
preliminary
tentative
twist
at
the
handle
came
a
quick
dismayed
hissing
sound
like
the
sharp
intake
of
the
safe
door
was
wrenched
open
with
a
jerk
there
was
a
low
angry
cry
now
the
man
sprang
back
and
as
though
involuntarily
in
a
sort
of
uncertain
search
his
flashlight
shot
along
the
fell
full
upon
the
hawk
the
hawk
finger
pressed
the
switch
the
room
was
ablaze
with
light
with
a
startled
furious
oath
the
man
hand
was
sweeping
significantly
toward
his
pocket
no
you
do
snarled
the
hawk
covering
the
other
no
you
do
cut
that
out
his
eyes
behind
the
mask
narrowed
suddenly
hello
he
sneered
it
might
have
known
from
the
way
you
opened
that
drawer
it
was
a
moment
before
the
man
answered
blast
you
he
whispered
finally
you
gave
me
a
bit
of
a
start
you
did
i
thought
at
first
you
were
a
his
eyes
fastened
on
the
pay
bag
at
the
hawk
feet
the
top
gaped
open
disclosing
the
banknotes
inside
the
man
raised
his
eyes
to
the
hawk
and
a
cunning
look
came
over
his
thin
face
caught
with
the
goods
this
time
eh
he
jerked
out
the
hawk
smiled
unpleasantly
yes
he
said
the
nest
empty
what
is
it
they
used
to
tell
us
in
the
nursery
the
early
bird
that
grabs
the
worm
how
long
you
been
out
in
these
parts
butcher
look
here
said
the
butcher
ingratiatingly
ignoring
the
question
i
guess
it
a
case
of
you
got
a
nerve
ejaculated
the
hawk
coolly
well
put
that
light
out
then
and
we
talk
it
over
suggested
the
butcher
if
it
seen
from
outside
we
both
get
i
rather
take
a
chance
on
that
than
a
chance
on
you
replied
the
hawk
curtly
there
nothing
to
talk
over
i
got
the
coin
and
you
got
a
you
got
to
do
now
is
beat
sharp
little
black
ferret
eyes
the
butcher
had
and
they
roamed
around
the
room
now
in
an
apparently
aimless
to
come
back
and
fix
hungrily
on
the
bag
of
banknotes
again
a
sullen
look
came
into
his
face
and
the
jaw
muscles
twitched
ominously
so
you
the
hawk
they
talking
about
eh
he
said
trying
to
speak
smoothly
well
there
no
use
of
us
quarrelling
if
you
know
me
we
must
be
old
pals
take
off
that
mask
and
let
have
a
look
at
you
there
ai
any
reason
why
we
ca
be
pals
nix
said
the
hawk
softly
nothing
doing
butcher
it
suits
me
pretty
well
the
way
it
is
i
made
it
a
rule
all
my
life
to
play
a
lone
hand
and
the
more
i
see
of
the
raw
work
that
guys
like
you
try
to
get
away
with
the
more
i
pat
myself
on
the
back
savvy
why
say
even
a
on
canal
street
would
show
his
face
to
a
crook
for
a
month
he
be
so
ashamed
if
he
took
a
crowbar
to
a
desk
drawer
the
way
you
did
you
poor
boob
the
butcher
face
flushed
and
he
scowled
you
looking
for
trouble
ai
you
he
said
hoarsely
well
mabbe
you
get
mabbe
you
get
more
than
you
looking
for
how
you
get
wise
to
this
game
it
the
way
i
make
my
wise
how
you
suppose
queried
the
hawk
insolently
the
butcher
was
chewing
at
his
lips
angrily
his
eyes
closed
to
slits
searched
the
hawk
masked
face
this
is
the
second
time
he
said
between
his
teeth
you
pinched
that
necklace
exclaimed
the
hawk
with
a
grin
so
you
were
after
that
too
were
you
the
butcher
flush
deepened
that
none
of
your
damned
business
he
gritted
and
if
i
he
bit
his
lips
quickly
go
on
invited
the
hawk
sweetly
do
mind
me
if
you
you
had
the
luck
with
you
mumbled
the
butcher
half
to
himself
it
ca
be
anything
else
there
no
chance
of
a
leak
but
i
going
to
tell
you
luck
going
to
get
a
hole
kicked
in
it
i
tell
you
something
more
there
a
few
of
us
that
have
picked
out
this
little
stamping
ground
for
ourselves
and
we
ai
fond
of
trespassers
get
that
it
ai
going
to
be
healthy
for
you
to
linger
around
here
over
more
than
one
train
are
the
rest
of
all
like
you
inquired
the
hawk
maliciously
you
find
out
quicker
than
you
want
to
perhaps
the
butcher
retorted
furiously
all
right
said
the
hawk
and
now
i
tell
you
a
little
something
i
do
know
who
are
in
this
gang
of
yours
but
you
might
take
them
a
little
message
from
me
if
they
finding
it
crowded
out
here
they
better
move
on
to
somewhere
where
competition
is
so
likely
to
put
them
out
of
business
through
lack
of
brains
because
i
kind
of
figuring
on
hanging
around
until
it
gets
time
to
open
my
château
down
at
palm
beach
and
stick
my
feet
up
on
the
sofa
for
a
rest
do
you
stumble
to
that
and
hawk
was
drawling
i
might
say
butcher
that
i
do
like
you
my
fingers
are
crossed
on
that
trespassing
gag
it
do
go
i
do
scare
for
any
outfit
of
i
stick
here
as
long
as
anything
worth
sticking
the
butcher
eyes
seemed
to
be
fascinated
by
the
pay
were
on
it
again
he
choked
a
little
swallowing
hard
and
attempting
a
change
of
front
forced
a
smile
well
do
get
sore
he
said
in
a
whining
tone
mabbe
i
was
only
trying
to
chuck
a
bluff
and
got
called
but
say
how
you
like
to
break
in
here
like
i
did
and
find
another
fellow
got
all
the
swag
say
it
damned
rough
ai
it
say
it
fierce
and
look
here
i
in
on
it
now
anyhow
i
know
who
took
it
going
to
keep
my
mouth
shut
ai
i
you
ai
going
to
leave
me
out
in
the
cold
are
you
all
i
ask
is
a
it
not
much
said
the
hawk
in
a
velvet
voice
it
hardly
seems
enough
you
too
modest
butcher
why
do
you
ask
for
the
whole
of
it
you
might
as
stand
just
as
much
chance
of
getting
it
the
smile
faded
from
the
butcher
lips
and
his
face
became
contorted
with
rage
again
he
raised
his
fist
and
shook
it
at
the
hawk
he
cursed
in
abandon
his
lips
livid
beside
himself
with
passion
you
get
yours
for
this
he
choked
in
his
fury
over
his
words
you
think
you
slick
i
show
you
what
you
up
against
inside
of
hours
you
crawl
for
this
d
hear
blast
crawl
the
hawk
automatic
dangling
nonchalantly
in
his
hand
swung
suddenly
upward
to
a
level
with
the
other
eyes
that
enough
you
cheap
skate
was
a
cold
menacing
ring
in
the
hawk
voice
now
i
heard
enough
from
you
you
and
your
crowd
of
lags
if
you
or
any
of
you
run
foul
of
me
again
you
wo
get
off
so
easy
tell
that
tell
the
hawk
said
so
and
you
beat
it
and
beat
he
caught
up
the
pay
bag
and
advanced
a
step
the
butcher
retreated
sullenly
get
out
of
that
window
ordered
the
hawk
evenly
and
take
a
last
tip
from
me
if
you
try
to
plant
me
if
you
let
a
peep
out
of
you
while
i
making
my
own
getaway
i
get
you
for
it
butcher
if
it
the
last
thing
i
ever
do
go
on
now
step
quicker
still
sullenly
mumbling
his
mouth
working
the
butcher
retreated
backward
toward
the
window
the
hawk
his
lips
like
a
thin
straight
line
just
showing
under
the
mask
followed
grimly
step
by
step
and
then
suddenly
both
men
halted
and
their
eyes
met
and
held
each
other
in
a
long
tense
gaze
from
outside
in
the
corridor
came
the
sound
of
voices
and
footsteps
the
footsteps
drew
nearer
the
voices
grew
louder
the
hawk
shot
a
glance
toward
the
door
he
drew
in
his
breath
sharply
no
there
was
no
fanlight
the
light
would
not
show
in
the
hall
that
was
the
superintendent
voice
that
letter
lanson
was
going
to
send
down
on
no
the
other
probably
was
macvightie
yes
it
was
caught
the
detective
gruff
tones
now
the
door
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
corridor
from
the
paymaster
room
opened
the
butcher
licked
his
lips
me
for
the
window
and
for
it
quick
he
muttered
under
his
breath
he
turned
and
his
back
to
the
hawk
now
tiptoed
to
the
window
turned
again
sideways
as
though
to
throw
one
leg
over
the
his
right
hand
hidden
suddenly
lifted
the
side
of
his
coat
it
came
quick
quick
as
the
winking
of
an
eye
racketing
through
room
and
building
like
the
detonation
of
a
cannon
in
the
silence
came
the
roar
of
a
revolver
shot
as
the
butcher
fired
through
his
coat
pocket
mechanically
the
hawk
staggered
backward
and
then
the
quick
keen
brain
working
like
lightning
he
reeled
dropped
the
pay
bag
and
clutched
wildly
at
his
side
he
was
not
hit
the
butcher
had
missed
so
that
was
the
man
game
clever
enough
they
break
in
here
at
the
sound
of
the
shot
and
find
him
dead
or
wounded
on
the
floor
the
butcher
a
devil
triumph
in
his
face
now
came
leaping
back
from
the
window
and
stooping
snatched
at
the
pay
bag
i
put
another
in
you
to
make
sure
whispered
the
butcher
fiercely
only
they
get
you
anyway
the
hawk
straightened
his
arm
streaked
outward
from
his
side
his
pistol
butt
crashed
on
the
butcher
skull
and
he
was
upon
the
other
like
a
flash
his
free
hand
at
the
butcher
throat
from
the
room
opposite
came
startled
cries
across
the
corridor
came
the
rush
of
the
doorhandle
was
tried
the
door
shaken
violently
the
butcher
was
struggling
but
feebly
making
only
a
pitiful
effort
to
loosen
the
hawk
clutch
upon
his
throat
hanging
almost
limply
in
the
hawk
arms
half
dazed
by
the
blow
upon
his
head
white
to
the
lips
with
passion
the
hawk
whipped
his
hand
into
the
other
pocket
whipped
out
the
other
revolver
and
flung
the
man
away
from
him
and
then
as
the
butcher
reeled
and
lurched
backward
to
the
window
and
clawing
frantically
at
the
sill
attempted
to
work
his
way
out
the
hawk
ran
silently
back
picked
up
the
pay
bag
and
jumping
to
the
window
again
caught
the
butcher
roughly
by
the
collar
of
the
coat
the
butcher
white
with
fear
moaned
for
god
sake
he
pleaded
piteously
let
me
go
let
me
go
for
god
sake
let
me
get
me
there
was
a
terrific
crash
upon
the
door
as
of
some
heavy
body
hurled
against
it
the
hawk
laughed
mirthlessly
if
i
let
you
go
you
break
your
neck
hawk
words
were
coming
through
clenched
teeth
do
worry
butcher
not
get
you
i
do
want
them
to
get
you
i
want
to
get
you
myself
for
this
some
day
butcher
some
day
i
do
the
getting
he
pushed
the
butcher
feet
over
the
sill
feel
with
your
toes
for
the
window
casing
beneath
quick
he
leaned
out
gripping
at
the
butcher
collar
lowering
the
lips
were
close
against
the
butcher
ear
some
yellow
and
me
day
a
crash
again
upon
the
door
the
butcher
feet
were
on
the
lower
sill
but
here
the
man
lost
his
hold
and
toppled
to
the
ground
the
hawk
glanced
backward
into
the
room
the
door
was
yielding
now
he
looked
out
of
the
window
again
the
butcher
had
regained
his
feet
and
was
swaying
against
the
wall
holding
to
it
making
his
way
slowly
weakly
toward
the
corner
the
hawk
threw
one
leg
over
the
sill
with
a
rip
and
tear
the
door
smashed
inward
sagging
from
its
lower
hinge
came
a
hoarse
yell
macvightie
was
plunging
through
the
doorway
instantly
the
hawk
hugging
the
pay
bag
drew
back
his
leg
and
dove
into
the
clerk
room
through
the
door
which
he
had
left
ajar
there
would
have
been
no
use
in
letting
the
butcher
go
at
all
if
he
led
the
chase
through
the
man
was
barely
crawling
away
across
the
room
light
enough
now
from
the
open
doorway
behind
him
to
point
the
way
raced
the
hawk
he
reached
the
corridor
door
as
macvightie
lunged
through
the
connecting
door
in
pursuit
macvightie
voice
rose
in
a
bellow
of
warning
look
out
there
lanson
the
next
but
the
hawk
was
the
quicker
he
tore
the
door
open
and
dashed
through
just
eluding
the
superintendent
and
another
dispatcher
probably
attracted
by
the
they
sprang
forward
from
the
paymaster
door
running
like
a
deer
the
hawk
made
for
the
stairway
it
was
lighter
now
in
the
hall
the
dispatcher
door
along
at
the
farther
end
was
open
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
a
call
boy
gaped
openmouthed
the
hawk
brushed
the
boy
aside
incontinently
and
taking
the
stairs
three
and
four
at
a
time
leaped
downward
macvightie
roar
echoing
behind
him
the
top
stairs
creaking
under
the
rush
the
street
door
opened
outward
and
as
the
hawk
reached
it
and
wrenching
at
the
knob
pushed
it
open
there
was
a
flash
the
report
of
a
revolver
with
a
venomous
spat
the
bullet
buried
itself
in
the
door
jamb
not
an
inch
from
his
head
it
seemed
for
the
wind
of
the
bullet
was
on
his
cheek
cries
sounded
now
from
the
railroad
yard
but
the
street
in
front
of
him
deserted
was
still
undisturbed
he
was
across
it
in
a
twinkling
and
passing
the
saloon
that
was
now
closed
darted
into
the
lane
he
flung
a
glance
over
his
his
lips
set
hard
macvightie
big
man
though
he
was
was
no
mean
antagonist
in
a
race
the
detective
quicker
in
initiative
quicker
on
his
feet
had
outdistanced
both
lanson
and
the
dispatcher
and
was
already
halfway
across
the
street
again
macvightie
fired
on
the
hawk
ran
if
he
could
reach
the
next
there
was
no
one
about
the
was
a
way
a
risky
way
but
still
a
way
his
best
chance
of
escape
the
cheap
combination
lodging
house
and
saloon
that
was
just
around
the
corner
was
where
he
had
a
room
yes
it
was
his
one
chance
he
must
get
to
cover
somewhere
without
an
instant
delay
with
macvightie
firing
now
emptying
his
revolver
up
the
lane
with
the
yells
and
shouts
growing
constantly
in
volume
from
farther
back
toward
the
station
it
was
only
a
question
of
minutes
before
the
whole
neighbourhood
would
be
aroused
again
he
glanced
behind
him
it
was
very
dark
in
the
lane
he
was
grimly
conscious
that
it
was
the
blackness
and
not
macvightie
poor
marksmanship
that
had
saved
him
so
far
that
flash
of
the
revolver
was
perhaps
fifty
yards
away
he
had
gained
a
little
then
if
there
was
any
one
around
the
corner
the
plan
of
reaching
his
room
would
not
serve
him
and
he
would
still
have
to
run
for
it
well
he
would
see
in
an
was
only
two
yards
without
slackening
his
pace
at
top
speed
he
swung
from
the
with
a
gasp
of
relief
at
sight
of
an
empty
street
slipped
into
a
doorway
just
beyond
the
now
dark
entrance
to
a
saloon
that
occupied
most
of
the
ground
floor
of
a
dirty
and
squalid
building
the
door
gave
on
a
narrow
flight
of
stairs
and
up
these
the
hawk
sprang
swiftly
and
with
scarcely
a
sound
and
now
as
he
ran
he
pulled
his
mask
from
his
face
and
thrust
it
into
the
pay
bag
a
from
his
inside
coat
pocket
followed
the
mask
and
with
the
pocketbook
the
flashlight
and
the
two
pistols
his
own
and
the
butcher
he
opened
a
door
at
the
head
of
the
landing
and
stepped
into
a
room
leaving
the
door
partly
open
he
was
not
safe
from
it
he
did
not
macvightie
it
would
be
obvious
to
macvightie
that
he
was
not
far
enough
ahead
to
have
disappeared
in
any
but
one
some
building
within
a
very
few
yards
of
the
lane
and
the
presumption
at
least
would
be
that
this
was
the
one
the
hawk
worked
now
with
almost
incredible
speed
he
switched
on
the
light
ran
to
the
window
that
opened
on
the
rear
of
the
building
felt
with
one
hand
along
the
sill
outside
lifted
the
pay
bag
out
of
the
window
let
go
of
it
and
turned
instantly
back
into
the
room
he
hung
up
his
hat
on
a
wall
peg
and
tearing
off
his
jacket
flung
it
haphazardly
upon
the
bed
there
was
a
small
table
against
the
wall
near
the
foot
of
the
bed
the
hawk
opened
a
drawer
snatched
up
a
pack
of
cards
and
sat
down
at
the
table
the
street
door
opened
and
closed
a
quick
heavy
tread
sounded
on
the
stairs
in
his
shirt
sleeves
his
back
to
the
door
the
hawk
was
coolly
playing
solitaire
i
guess
i
better
be
smoking
murmured
the
hawk
maybe
breathing
a
little
he
picked
up
a
pipe
from
the
table
lighted
a
half
the
deck
of
cards
in
one
hand
the
lighted
match
in
the
other
swung
around
in
his
chair
with
a
startled
jerk
the
door
slammed
back
against
the
wall
macvightie
had
unceremoniously
kicked
it
wide
open
macvightie
was
standing
on
the
threshold
the
hawk
in
a
sort
of
surprised
gasp
sucked
the
flame
of
the
match
down
into
the
bowl
of
his
pipe
and
stared
at
macvightie
through
a
curtain
of
tobacco
smoke
the
detective
eyes
travelled
sharply
from
the
hawk
around
the
room
came
back
to
the
hawk
narrowed
and
stepping
into
the
room
he
shut
the
door
with
equal
lack
of
ceremony
behind
him
say
you
got
a
gall
ejaculated
the
hawk
you
bet
your
life
i
have
flung
out
macvightie
now
then
my
bucko
what
are
you
doing
here
say
said
the
hawk
as
though
obsessed
with
but
a
single
idea
say
you
got
a
gall
you
got
a
gall
busting
into
a
fellow
room
and
asking
him
what
he
doing
there
say
maybe
you
might
answer
the
same
question
what
are
you
doing
here
your
room
is
it
snapped
macvightie
sure
it
my
room
replied
the
hawk
a
little
tartly
how
long
you
been
here
a
week
hawk
was
growing
ungracious
boarding
here
where
you
come
from
macvightie
was
clipping
off
his
words
what
do
you
do
for
a
living
say
said
the
hawk
politely
you
go
to
hell
macvightie
stepped
forward
toward
the
hawk
with
an
ominous
scowl
and
throwing
back
the
lapel
of
his
coat
tapped
grimly
with
his
forefinger
on
a
shield
that
decorated
his
vest
the
hawk
whistled
low
said
the
hawk
with
sudden
cordiality
well
why
you
say
so
before
i
saying
it
now
snarled
macvightie
well
where
do
you
come
from
chicago
said
the
hawk
what
your
business
eyes
were
roving
sharply
again
around
the
room
i
can
get
a
job
answered
the
hawk
and
then
insinuatingly
and
say
i
looking
for
one
now
and
if
you
can
put
me
on
to
anything
i
guess
you
got
to
show
me
growled
uncompromisingly
look
here
ventured
the
hawk
what
up
i
waiting
prompted
macvightie
significantly
oh
all
right
the
hawk
flared
up
a
little
if
you
love
your
grouch
keep
on
hugging
it
tight
he
jerked
his
hand
toward
the
coat
that
was
lying
on
the
bed
i
must
have
lost
the
letter
the
pastor
of
my
church
gave
me
but
there
a
couple
there
from
the
guys
back
in
chicago
that
i
worked
for
and
there
my
union
card
with
them
help
yourself
macvightie
picked
up
the
coat
brusquely
shoved
his
hand
into
the
inside
pocket
brought
out
several
letters
and
began
to
read
them
the
hawk
shuffled
the
half
deck
of
cards
in
his
hand
monotonously
there
was
a
puzzled
frown
on
macvightie
face
as
he
finally
tossed
the
letters
down
on
the
bed
satisfied
inquired
the
hawk
pleasantly
macvightie
frown
deepened
yes
as
far
as
that
goes
he
said
tersely
and
then
evenly
his
eyes
boring
into
the
hawk
about
five
minutes
ago
a
man
ran
into
this
house
from
the
street
what
become
of
him
the
hawk
started
in
slowly
shook
his
head
i
guess
you
got
the
wrong
dope
ai
you
he
suggested
earnestly
do
try
that
game
cautioned
macvightie
grimly
and
lie
he
had
to
come
up
these
stairs
your
door
was
partly
open
and
he
could
have
passed
without
you
knowing
that
what
i
saying
agreed
the
hawk
even
more
earnestly
that
why
i
saying
you
must
have
got
the
wrong
dope
of
course
he
could
have
got
by
without
me
hearing
him
that
a
cinch
and
i
telling
you
straight
he
did
he
macvightie
smile
was
thin
then
he
came
in
this
in
here
echoed
the
hawk
weakly
his
gaze
wandered
helplessly
around
the
room
well
all
you
got
to
do
is
i
going
to
announced
macvightie
with
a
sudden
jerk
he
yanked
the
single
bed
out
from
the
wall
he
peered
behind
and
beneath
it
then
stepping
over
to
a
cretonne
curtain
in
the
corner
that
served
as
wardrobe
he
pulled
it
roughly
aside
there
were
no
other
places
of
possible
concealment
macvightie
chewed
at
his
under
lip
and
eyed
the
hawk
speculatively
the
hawk
eyes
were
still
travelling
bewilderedly
about
the
room
as
though
he
still
expected
to
find
something
are
you
dead
sure
he
came
into
this
house
he
inquired
heavily
as
though
the
problem
were
entirely
beyond
him
macvightie
hesitated
he
acknowledged
after
a
moment
i
guess
straight
all
right
and
i
admit
i
did
see
him
come
in
but
i
have
pretty
near
taken
an
oath
on
then
i
guess
he
must
have
ducked
somewhere
else
submitted
the
hawk
sapiently
there
was
no
one
went
by
that
giving
it
to
you
on
the
macvightie
reluctant
smile
was
a
wry
grimace
yes
i
reckon
it
my
his
voice
lost
its
snarl
and
his
fingers
groped
down
into
his
vest
pocket
here
have
a
cigar
he
invited
placatingly
why
hawk
beamed
radiantly
say
all
right
young
fellow
a
wave
of
his
hand
macvightie
moved
to
the
door
all
right
young
fellow
no
harm
done
eh
the
door
closed
the
footsteps
without
grew
fainter
and
died
away
the
hawk
staring
at
the
door
apostrophised
the
doorknob
well
say
what
do
you
know
about
that
he
said
numbly
i
wonder
what
up
he
rose
from
his
chair
after
a
moment
as
though
moved
by
a
sort
of
subconscious
impulse
mechanically
pushed
his
bed
back
against
the
wall
and
returned
to
his
chair
he
dug
out
his
pipe
abstractedly
filled
it
and
lighted
it
he
gathered
up
the
cards
shuffled
them
and
began
to
lay
them
out
again
on
the
paused
and
drummed
with
his
fingers
on
the
table
top
they
after
some
guy
that
ducked
his
nut
somewhere
around
here
he
decided
aloud
i
wonder
what
up
the
hawk
spread
out
his
remaining
swept
them
away
from
him
into
an
indiscriminate
heap
aw
to
blazes
with
cards
he
ejaculated
impatiently
he
put
his
feet
up
on
the
table
and
sucked
steadily
at
his
pipe
it
a
cinch
he
never
went
by
that
door
the
hawk
assured
the
toe
of
his
boot
i
guess
he
handed
that
one
all
right
all
the
minutes
passed
the
hawk
engrossed
continued
to
suck
on
his
pipe
then
from
far
down
the
stairs
there
came
a
faint
creak
and
an
instant
later
the
outer
door
closed
softly
the
hawk
feet
came
down
from
the
table
and
the
hawk
tut
tut
chided
the
hawk
that
treadmill
diminuendo
on
the
top
step
and
the
keyhole
stunt
is
pretty
raw
raw
you
forgot
the
front
door
do
seem
to
remember
having
heard
it
open
or
close
until
just
now
the
back
of
the
hawk
chair
as
he
pushed
it
well
away
from
the
table
and
stood
up
curiously
enough
now
intercepted
itself
between
the
keyhole
and
the
interior
of
the
room
he
stepped
to
the
door
and
slipped
the
bolt
quietly
into
place
then
going
to
the
window
he
reached
out
and
from
where
it
hung
upon
a
nail
driven
into
the
sill
picked
up
the
pay
bag
that
a
pretty
old
gag
too
observed
the
hawk
almost
apologetically
i
was
lucky
to
get
by
with
the
hawk
attention
was
now
directed
to
his
trunk
that
was
between
the
table
and
the
foot
of
the
bed
he
lifted
the
lid
back
against
the
wall
and
removed
an
ingeniously
fashioned
false
top
in
the
shape
of
a
tray
that
fitted
innocently
into
the
curvature
of
the
lid
the
hawk
stared
at
a
magnificent
diamond
necklace
that
glittered
and
gleamed
on
the
bottom
of
the
tray
as
its
thousand
facets
caught
the
grinned
if
you
only
known
macvightie
he
murmured
from
the
pay
bag
the
hawk
took
out
the
packages
of
banknotes
the
flashlight
the
mask
the
two
pistols
and
packed
them
neatly
away
in
the
tray
the
only
article
left
in
the
bag
was
his
pocketbook
he
opened
this
disclosing
a
number
of
crisp
new
bills
he
held
one
of
them
up
to
the
light
for
a
moment
studying
it
admiringly
i
guess
these
wo
be
much
more
good
around
here
according
to
that
little
conversation
between
macvightie
and
the
superintendent
he
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
tossed
the
entire
number
into
the
tray
he
fitted
the
false
top
back
into
the
lid
and
closed
the
trunk
there
remained
the
empty
pay
bag
he
frowned
at
it
for
an
instant
then
picking
it
up
he
tucked
it
under
the
mattress
of
his
bed
i
get
rid
of
that
in
the
morning
nodded
his
head
as
he
turned
down
the
bed
covers
the
hawk
began
to
undress
and
at
intervals
voiced
snatches
of
his
thoughts
aloud
pretty
close
shave
said
the
hawk
pretty
close
ten
thousand
dollars
is
some
haul
all
right
as
long
as
they
do
find
out
i
got
the
key
to
their
cipher
and
so
butcher
rose
is
one
of
the
gang
eh
number
rose
guess
he
got
away
all
macvightie
he
nearly
did
me
pretty
close
shave
the
hawk
turned
out
the
light
and
got
into
bed
i
guess
i
played
in
luck
said
the
hawk
softly
and
for
the
second
time
that
night
yes
i
guess
i
bald
creek
station
it
was
hours
later
a
half
mile
away
along
a
road
that
showed
like
a
grey
thread
in
the
night
twinkled
a
few
lights
from
the
little
cluster
of
houses
that
made
the
town
of
bald
creek
at
the
rear
of
the
station
itself
in
the
shadow
of
the
walls
it
was
inky
black
there
was
stillness
then
the
chattering
of
a
telegraph
coincident
with
this
low
scarcely
audible
a
sound
like
the
gnawing
of
a
rat
the
chattering
of
the
instrument
ceased
and
coincident
again
the
low
gnawing
sound
crouched
against
a
rear
window
the
hawk
chuckled
a
little
grimly
to
himself
within
and
diagonally
across
from
the
window
an
otherwise
dark
interior
was
traversed
by
a
dull
ray
of
light
that
filtered
in
through
the
open
connecting
door
of
the
operator
room
beyond
inside
there
were
the
division
superintendent
and
martin
the
trusted
bald
creek
operator
while
at
any
minute
now
macvightie
would
be
up
on
no
they
were
preparing
to
spring
their
trap
for
the
wire
devils
the
hawk
was
quite
on
this
point
for
the
very
simple
reason
that
the
hawk
himself
had
not
been
entirely
idle
during
those
hours
that
were
just
past
again
the
sounder
broke
into
a
splutter
but
this
time
the
gnawing
sound
was
not
window
fastenings
were
loosened
now
came
then
the
distant
rumble
of
an
approaching
train
the
rumble
deepening
into
a
roar
the
roar
disintegrating
itself
into
its
component
sounds
the
wheel
trucks
beating
at
the
rail
joints
the
bark
of
the
exhaust
then
the
scream
of
the
brakeshoes
biting
at
the
wheel
tires
the
hiss
of
in
the
mimic
pandemonium
the
hawk
raised
the
window
and
crawled
in
over
the
sill
and
again
the
hawk
chuckled
to
himself
up
and
down
the
line
at
all
stations
where
there
were
no
night
operators
the
detectives
stood
guard
over
the
telegraph
instruments
it
had
been
macvightie
plan
originated
the
night
before
it
was
very
clever
of
somewhat
abortive
also
quite
irrelevant
of
course
and
quite
apart
from
that
little
matter
of
ten
thousand
dollars
which
he
the
hawk
had
taken
from
the
paymaster
safe
last
night
macvightie
was
likely
to
be
in
no
very
pleasant
mood
the
engine
without
blowing
from
a
full
head
of
steam
drowned
out
all
other
sounds
the
hawk
picked
his
way
across
the
room
to
a
position
near
the
connecting
door
and
composedly
seated
himself
upon
the
floor
behind
a
number
of
boxes
and
parcels
with
a
grin
of
acknowledgment
to
the
escaping
steam
he
coolly
moved
two
of
the
parcels
a
few
inches
to
right
and
left
thus
providing
himself
with
an
excellent
view
into
the
operator
room
from
one
pocket
he
took
an
exceedingly
small
flashlight
and
from
another
a
notebook
and
from
his
hip
pocket
his
automatic
pistol
this
latter
he
transferred
to
his
coat
pocket
bunching
the
bottom
of
his
coat
over
his
hand
he
flashed
on
the
tiny
ray
found
a
convenient
ledge
formed
by
one
of
the
boxes
and
upon
this
laid
down
his
notebook
the
first
page
as
he
opened
the
book
contained
a
neatly
drawn
sketch
of
the
interior
of
bald
creek
station
he
turned
this
over
leaving
the
book
open
at
a
blank
page
and
switched
off
his
light
the
door
from
the
platform
opened
and
closed
as
the
train
pulled
out
again
a
man
stepped
into
the
operator
in
the
darkness
the
hawk
smiled
appreciatively
it
was
macvightie
and
thin
lips
were
drawn
tighter
than
usual
and
the
brim
of
the
slouch
hat
though
pulled
far
forward
did
not
hide
the
scowl
upon
countenance
well
you
here
all
right
lanson
eh
he
flung
out
brusquely
nothing
yet
by
any
chance
of
course
lanson
from
a
chair
at
the
operator
elbow
nodded
a
greeting
not
yet
he
said
macvightie
was
glancing
sharply
around
him
martin
he
ordered
abruptly
close
those
two
ticket
wickets
the
operator
rose
obediently
and
pulled
down
the
little
windows
that
opened
one
on
each
side
of
the
office
on
the
men
and
waiting
rooms
what
that
door
there
demanded
macvightie
pointing
toward
the
rear
room
just
a
place
i
had
partitioned
off
for
stores
and
small
express
stuff
martin
answered
there
no
back
all
right
then
said
macvightie
he
pulled
up
a
chair
for
himself
on
the
other
side
of
the
operator
as
martin
returned
to
his
seat
you
know
what
you
here
for
you
to
do
lanson
has
told
you
yes
martin
replied
i
to
test
out
for
east
or
west
if
there
any
of
that
monkeying
on
the
wire
show
me
how
it
done
directed
macvightie
tersely
the
operator
reached
over
to
the
switchboard
and
picked
up
a
i
only
got
to
plug
this
here
those
are
my
ground
wires
east
and
west
the
main
batteries
are
west
of
us
at
selkirk
you
know
if
i
ground
out
everything
east
for
instance
and
he
working
to
the
east
of
us
the
sounder
stop
because
i
cut
him
off
from
the
main
batteries
and
we
hear
nothing
unless
i
adjust
the
relay
down
to
get
the
weak
circuit
from
the
local
batteries
if
he
working
west
of
us
the
sounder
will
be
much
stronger
because
the
main
batteries
at
selkirk
with
the
eastern
half
of
the
division
cut
out
will
be
working
on
a
shorter
macvightie
frowned
and
he
know
lanson
told
me
last
yes
he
know
it
said
martin
the
same
as
we
well
you
can
do
it
pretty
quick
ca
you
suggested
macvightie
sort
of
accidentally
like
we
do
want
to
throw
a
scare
into
him
you
know
almost
instantly
whether
he
was
east
or
west
would
you
that
all
that
then
let
him
go
ahead
again
we
have
found
out
what
we
want
to
he
turned
to
lanson
his
voice
rasping
suddenly
did
you
see
the
journal
on
the
wave
this
afternoon
lanson
alert
grey
eyes
took
on
an
angry
glint
no
i
see
it
but
i
suppose
it
the
old
story
i
wish
they
cut
it
out
it
hurts
the
road
and
it
does
get
them
perhaps
not
said
macvightie
with
a
thin
smile
but
it
gets
me
yes
it
about
the
except
the
last
of
it
big
headlines
thousand
dollars
stolen
from
paymaster
safe
last
is
being
done
to
stop
this
reign
of
assassination
theft
outrage
crime
the
clue
afforded
by
the
hawk
release
from
sing
sing
been
thoroughly
investigated
and
then
a
list
of
the
crimes
committed
in
the
last
ten
murders
one
in
the
compartment
of
that
sleeping
car
the
theft
of
the
diamond
necklace
the
express
robbery
and
so
on
through
the
list
ending
up
with
last
night
then
a
nasty
shot
at
the
local
police
and
finally
prefacing
the
remark
with
the
statement
that
the
crimes
were
all
connected
with
the
railroad
a
thinly
veiled
hint
that
i
am
either
a
boy
on
a
man
job
or
else
asleep
in
either
of
which
cases
i
ought
to
you
understand
macvightie
fist
came
down
with
a
crash
on
the
operator
table
lanson
with
a
worried
look
nodded
his
head
damn
it
said
macvightie
he
stopped
abruptly
and
laid
his
hand
on
the
operator
sleeve
look
here
martin
he
said
evenly
you
the
one
man
that
lanson
has
picked
out
of
the
division
you
the
one
man
outside
of
lanson
and
myself
who
has
any
inkling
that
these
secret
messages
coming
over
our
wires
have
anything
to
do
with
these
understand
that
do
you
this
is
pretty
serious
business
the
newspaper
did
exaggerate
any
we
up
against
a
gang
of
crooks
cleverly
organised
who
will
stop
at
nothing
murder
appears
to
be
a
pastime
with
them
do
you
get
for
a
long
second
the
two
men
looked
each
other
steadily
in
the
eyes
yes
said
martin
simply
all
right
said
macvightie
i
just
want
you
to
realise
the
necessity
of
keeping
anything
you
may
hear
or
anything
that
may
happen
here
under
your
he
turned
to
lanson
again
the
scowl
heavy
upon
his
face
once
more
i
was
going
to
say
that
i
know
who
the
man
is
that
slipped
through
my
fingers
last
lanson
leaned
sharply
forward
in
his
chair
but
he
got
away
you
said
it
was
the
hawk
bit
off
the
words
the
hawk
the
hawk
but
how
do
you
know
demanded
lanson
incredulously
you
said
yourself
that
he
had
left
no
clue
to
his
identity
how
do
you
know
macvightie
reached
into
his
pocket
took
out
his
pocketbook
and
from
the
pocketbook
passed
a
new
crisp
banknote
to
lanson
what
this
inquired
lanson
the
counterfeit
bill
you
showed
me
last
night
one
macvightie
answered
curtly
look
on
the
other
lanson
turned
the
banknote
over
stared
at
it
and
whistled
suddenly
under
his
breath
the
compliments
of
the
hawk
he
read
aloud
he
stared
now
at
macvightie
perhaps
it
a
fake
inspired
by
that
newspaper
article
yesterday
evening
he
suggested
it
no
fake
declared
macvightie
grimly
the
hawk
wrote
that
there
all
was
inside
the
pay
bag
in
which
the
ten
thousand
was
carried
away
from
the
paymaster
office
last
you
recovered
the
bag
cried
lanson
eagerly
where
when
the
hawk
watching
macvightie
face
grinned
wickedly
jaws
were
clamped
belligerently
and
upon
macvightie
cheeks
was
an
angry
flush
oh
yes
i
it
macvightie
snapped
got
his
nerve
with
him
the
bag
was
found
reposing
in
full
view
on
the
baggage
counter
at
selkirk
this
to
me
nobody
knows
how
it
got
there
but
fist
came
down
again
upon
the
operator
this
time
he
overplayed
his
hand
we
knew
he
had
been
released
from
sing
sing
and
that
he
had
come
west
but
it
was
only
surmise
that
he
was
actually
around
we
know
in
the
second
place
it
pretty
good
evidence
that
he
in
with
the
gang
that
flooded
the
country
with
those
counterfeit
tens
and
you
remember
i
told
you
last
night
i
had
a
hunch
it
was
the
same
gang
that
was
operating
out
two
and
two
make
four
you
think
lanson
swept
his
hand
suggestively
toward
the
telegraph
instruments
the
leader
of
now
he
out
here
on
the
ground
returned
macvightie
gruffly
the
hawk
had
taken
a
pencil
from
his
pocket
and
was
scribbling
aimlessly
at
the
top
of
the
page
in
his
notebook
sure
confided
the
hawk
to
himself
i
thought
maybe
dope
it
out
like
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
in
the
office
save
for
the
intermittent
clicking
of
the
sounder
to
which
the
hawk
now
gave
his
attention
his
pencil
still
made
aimless
markings
on
the
top
of
the
was
only
routine
business
going
over
the
wire
then
lanson
moved
uncomfortably
in
his
chair
and
the
chair
legs
squeaked
on
the
bare
floor
macvightie
spoke
again
well
he
said
bluntly
you
got
all
of
my
end
of
it
except
that
i
placed
men
in
hiding
at
every
station
on
the
line
where
there
are
no
night
operators
what
about
you
started
your
outside
line
inspection
yes
lanson
answered
i
had
three
men
out
with
section
crews
working
from
different
points
but
it
slow
business
making
an
inspection
that
careful
enough
to
be
of
any
use
and
even
then
it
a
pretty
tall
order
to
call
the
turn
on
anything
when
already
so
many
legitimate
splices
and
repairs
on
the
results
asked
macvightie
lanson
shook
his
head
we
found
what
we
thought
was
a
new
splice
in
one
place
but
it
turned
out
to
have
been
made
by
one
of
our
own
men
two
weeks
ago
only
he
had
forgotten
to
report
macvightie
eyes
narrowed
one
of
our
own
he
repeated
curtly
who
was
it
nothing
doing
there
lanson
shook
his
head
again
emphatically
this
time
it
was
observed
macvightie
softly
lanson
bridled
slightly
what
the
matter
with
calhoun
he
inquired
testily
got
anything
against
him
never
heard
of
him
before
said
macvightie
with
a
short
laugh
but
i
take
pains
to
make
his
then
you
might
as
well
spare
yourself
the
trouble
advised
lanson
i
can
tell
you
that
he
carries
a
good
record
on
this
division
and
that
he
one
of
the
best
linemen
we
i
daresay
admitted
macvightie
coolly
but
amongst
other
things
we
looking
for
good
linemen
forget
to
make
reports
you
need
get
touchy
lanson
because
one
of
your
men
names
comes
up
you
can
make
up
your
mind
to
it
there
an
inside
end
to
this
the
tiny
ray
of
the
hawk
flashlight
shot
suddenly
upon
the
notebook
open
page
as
the
sounder
broke
into
a
sharp
tattoo
at
four
he
muttered
as
he
began
to
write
they
changed
the
code
there
was
a
sharp
exclamation
from
the
other
room
listen
there
he
is
now
martin
cried
chairs
were
pushed
three
men
were
on
their
feet
what
he
sending
questioned
macvightie
instantly
the
hawk
scowled
at
the
disturbance
as
over
their
voices
he
concentrated
his
attention
upon
the
sounder
he
wrote
steadily
on
huwkmuh
hdtlqgvh
same
as
usual
martin
replied
just
a
jumble
of
well
then
get
ready
to
throw
that
ground
or
whatever
you
call
it
into
him
ordered
macvightie
tensely
i
ready
said
martin
all
right
the
hawk
nodded
to
himself
as
his
pencil
unflaggingly
noted
down
letter
after
letter
the
sounder
was
very
perceptibly
stronger
west
martin
cried
out
you
noticed
the
difference
in
strength
did
you
he
somewhere
between
here
and
selkirk
the
sounder
had
suddenly
ceased
but
he
stopped
said
macvightie
and
you
said
if
he
that
nothing
to
do
with
it
martin
interposed
hurriedly
the
wire
is
grounded
he
taken
to
cover
i
guess
said
lanson
i
was
afraid
he
would
scare
no
matter
he
broke
off
abruptly
wait
what
that
the
sounder
was
clicking
again
but
the
sharp
quick
tattoo
was
gone
and
in
its
place
as
though
indeed
it
drawled
the
sending
came
in
leisurely
deliberate
fashion
the
hawk
pencil
resumed
its
then
with
a
queer
smile
the
hawk
scratched
out
what
he
had
just
written
it
was
no
longer
was
in
exceedingly
plain
english
martin
was
reading
directly
from
the
sounder
well
of
all
the
infernal
nerve
exploded
macvightie
furiously
and
the
worst
of
it
said
lanson
shortly
is
that
he
got
us
where
he
wants
us
once
more
the
sounder
broke
into
the
old
quick
tattoo
the
hawk
was
writing
steadily
again
there
was
silence
now
between
the
three
in
the
office
a
minute
two
three
went
sounder
hawk
closed
his
notebook
then
in
its
leisurely
drawl
the
sounder
broke
again
and
again
martin
read
aloud
but
this
time
there
was
only
a
menacing
smile
on
macvightie
lips
he
west
of
here
you
say
he
shot
at
martin
yes
said
martin
briefly
and
that
splice
of
calhoun
lanson
where
was
that
lanson
drumming
with
his
fingers
on
the
edge
of
the
operator
table
looked
up
with
a
frown
nothing
but
coincidence
he
said
tersely
yes
it
was
west
of
near
he
moved
toward
the
door
nothing
more
we
can
do
here
i
going
back
on
no
let
get
out
on
the
platform
until
she
shows
the
hawk
very
carefully
replaced
his
notebook
his
flashlight
and
his
pencil
in
his
pockets
and
as
macvightie
and
the
superintendent
went
out
of
the
door
he
retreated
softly
back
to
the
rear
window
the
window
being
up
he
quite
as
noiselessly
slipped
out
over
the
sill
he
debated
a
moment
about
the
window
and
decided
that
if
any
significance
were
attached
to
the
fact
that
it
was
found
open
macvightie
for
instance
was
fully
entitled
to
make
the
most
of
the
significance
then
the
rattle
of
a
wagon
sounding
from
the
direction
of
the
road
the
hawk
moved
along
to
the
end
of
the
station
and
waited
the
wagon
in
the
light
of
its
own
smoky
oil
lamps
proved
to
be
the
town
hotel
bus
there
were
evidently
other
passengers
for
selkirk
besides
himself
and
the
two
officials
as
several
people
alighted
from
the
bus
in
view
of
this
fact
the
hawk
calmly
lighted
a
cigarette
though
the
glow
of
the
match
exposed
his
face
only
to
the
blank
wall
of
the
station
and
walked
around
to
the
front
platform
he
located
macvightie
and
lanson
and
thereafter
at
a
safe
distance
did
not
lose
sight
of
them
macvightie
memory
for
faces
would
hardly
be
if
credited
with
being
able
to
bridge
a
matter
of
some
hours
particularly
as
macvightie
had
evidenced
unusual
interest
in
the
occupant
of
the
room
on
the
first
landing
over
a
certain
saloon
the
night
before
the
hawk
therefore
was
unostentatiously
attentive
to
macvightie
movements
so
much
so
that
when
no
pulled
in
and
macvightie
and
lanson
boarded
the
chair
car
at
the
rear
of
the
train
the
hawk
when
no
pulled
out
quite
logically
boarded
the
smoking
car
at
the
forward
end
the
hawk
chose
the
most
uncomfortable
seat
in
the
rear
seat
with
stiff
upright
unyielding
back
that
was
built
against
the
settling
himself
down
produced
his
notebook
and
pencil
the
could
be
quite
confidentially
trusted
not
to
peer
over
his
shoulder
on
the
second
page
of
the
first
having
been
devoted
to
the
sketch
of
bald
creek
hawk
as
he
had
taken
it
from
the
sounder
had
written

the
hawk
tore
out
a
page
from
the
back
of
the
notebook
and
set
down
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
in
a
column
opposite
these
he
painstakingly
set
down
another
column
of
letters
after
that
the
hawk
worked
slowly
it
was
not
quite
so
simple
as
it
merely
the
substitution
of
letters
in
a
different
order
of
rotation
nor
apparently
from
the
hawk
observations
as
he
muttered
to
himself
were
all
messages

be
deciphered

appeared
to
possess
within
itself
an
elasticity
for
variation

muttered
the
hawk
pass
three
stroke
one
the
hawk
notebook
closed
was
reposing
idly
on
the
window
ledge
and
the
hawk
was
lighting
another
cigarette
as
the
conductor
came
down
the
aisle
the
hawk
presented
the
return
stub
of
a
ticket
to
selkirk
the
conductor
punched
it
and
passed
the
hawk
picked
up
his
notebook
again
again
he
was
again
the
after
all
was
not
proving
an
unmixed
blessing
it
seemed
as
though
every
man
in
the
car
were
possessed
of
an
inordinate
thirst
they
were
well
on
toward
selkirk
when
the
hawk
finally
completed
the
deciphering
of
the
message
it
now
ran
he
arranged
the
scattered
letters
into
words
and
the
words
into
sentences
number
three
and
seven
isaac

planned

the
hawk
inspected
his
hands
and
smiled
whimsically
number
one
was
the
butcher
he
had
not
given
the
butcher
credit
for
being
so
observant
presently
he
stared
out
of
the
window
wonder
how
much
of
a
haul
i
can
make
tonight
he
murmured
regular
el
work
it
all
up
and
handing
it
to
you
on
a
gold
platter
pretty
soft
hope
they
wo
get
discouraged
and
quit
picking
the
chestnuts
out
of
the
fire
for
there
any
chestnuts
left
and
then
the
hawk
frowned
suddenly
the
chestnuts
appeared
to
be
only
partially
picked
for
him
what
was
the
planned
there
must
have
been
a
previous
message
that
had
got
by
him
his
frown
deepened
there
was
no
way
of
remedying
that
to
hope
to
intercept
them
all
was
to
expect
too
much
there
was
no
way
whereby
he
could
spend
hours
out
of
in
touch
with
a
sounder
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
philosophically
after
a
moment
perhaps
it
was
just
as
well
they
credited
him
with
playing
a
lone
hand
believing
that
his
and
their
depredations
were
clashing
with
one
another
simply
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
their
mutual
pursuits
were
of
a
competitive
criminal
nature
that
was
all
if
it
happened
with
too
much
regularity
they
might
begin
to
suspect
that
he
had
the
key
to
their
cipher
and
hawk
did
not
care
to
contemplate
that
eventuality
there
would
be
no
more
chestnuts
the
hawk
read
the
first
part
of
the
message
over
again
who
was
isaac
kirschell
the
name
seemed
to
be
familiar
the
hawk
studied
the
toe
of
a
and
carefully
polished
shoe
thoughtfully
when
he
looked
up
again
he
nodded
he
remembered
now
he
had
lunched
the
day
before
in
a
restaurant
that
occupied
a
portion
of
the
ground
floor
of
an
office
building
the
corridor
of
which
ran
through
from
street
to
street
in
going
out
he
had
passed
along
the
corridor
and
had
seen
the
name
on
the
door
panels
of
two
of
the
offices
he
resumed
the
study
of
his
boot
toe
it
was
not
a
very
vital
matter
a
moment
spent
in
consulting
the
city
directory
would
have
supplied
the
information
in
any
case
he
nodded
again
macvightie
was
unquestionably
right
some
one
on
the
inside
some
railroader
and
probably
more
than
one
was
in
on
the
game
with
the
wire
it
was
perhaps
as
well
for
this
calhoun
that
macvightie
already
suspicious
was
not
likewise
possessed
of
the
key
to
the
cipher
also
lanson
had
been
right
it
was
no
easy
task
to
locate
a
new
splice
on
a
wire
that
was
already
scarred
with
countless
repairs
still
if
lanson
men
went
at
it
systematically
and
narrowed
down
the
radius
of
operations
it
was
not
impossible
that
they
might
stumble
upon
a
calhoun
did
not
placidly
inform
them
that
it
was
but
another
of
his
own
making
but
even
then
granted
that
the
wire
was
found
to
have
been
tapped
in
a
certain
place
one
night
that
was
no
reason
why
it
should
not
as
macvightie
had
already
suggested
be
tapped
fifty
miles
away
the
next
the
hawk
grinned
lanson
and
his
associates
backed
even
by
macvightie
were
confronted
with
a
problem
of
considerable
difficulty
i
wonder
communed
the
hawk
with
himself
who
the
spider
that
spun
the
web
and
i
wonder
how
many
little
spiders
he
got
running
around
on
it
he
perused
the
message
once
more
but
this
time
he
appeared
to
be
concerned
mainly
with
the
latter
portion
he
read
it
over
several
times
two
thousand
dollars
to
the
number
that
puts
a
bullet
in
nobody
seems
to
like
me
complained
the
hawk
softly
macvightie
does
and
the
butcher
crowd
seem
peeved
two
thousand
dollars
for
my
hide
i
guess
if
i
stick
around
here
long
enough
maybe
it
get
somebody
the
hawk
tore
up
the
message
the
sheet
on
which
he
had
deciphered
it
the
sketch
of
bald
creek
station
tore
all
three
into
small
fragments
opened
the
window
a
little
and
let
the
pieces
flutter
out
into
the
night
he
closed
the
window
returned
the
notebook
innocent
of
everything
now
but
its
blank
pages
to
his
pulling
his
slouch
hat
down
over
his
eyes
appeared
to
doze
which
a
cash
box
disappears
twenty
minutes
later
as
no
pulled
into
selkirk
the
hawk
his
erstwhile
drowsiness
little
in
evidence
dropped
to
the
platform
while
the
train
was
still
in
motion
and
before
macvightie
and
lanson
in
the
rear
car
it
might
be
fairly
assumed
had
thought
of
leaving
their
seats
the
hawk
was
interested
in
macvightie
for
the
balance
of
the
night
only
to
the
extent
of
keeping
out
of
macvightie
attention
was
centered
now
on
the
office
of
one
isaac
kirschell
and
the
possibilities
that
lay
in
the
said
isaac
kirschell
cash
box
he
glanced
at
the
illuminated
dial
of
the
tower
clock
it
was
eighteen
minutes
after
ten
that
the
worst
of
getting
the
dope
a
long
way
down
the
line
he
muttered
as
he
hurried
through
the
station
and
out
to
the
street
but
i
had
to
get
a
look
at
macvightie
cards
he
struck
off
toward
the
downtown
business
section
of
the
city
at
a
brisk
pace
it
ought
to
be
all
right
though
than
enough
time
to
get
in
ahead
of
not
likely
to
pull
any
break
in
that
locality
until
well
after
midnight
wonder
what
kirschell
got
in
his
cash
box
that
so
valuable
i
suppose
they
know
or
they
be
after
it
they
do
hunt
small
game
but
hawk
sighed
there
no
chance
of
any
such
luck
as
last
night
again
ten
thousand
dollars
in
cash
some
haul
yes
i
guess
maybe
they
peeved
the
hawk
arrived
at
his
destination
surveyed
the
office
building
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
the
restaurant
on
the
ground
floor
was
dark
but
a
lighted
window
here
and
there
on
the
floors
above
indicated
that
some
of
the
tenants
were
working
late
it
was
therefore
fairly
safe
to
presume
that
the
entrance
door
though
closed
was
unlocked
the
hawk
crossed
the
street
unconcernedly
and
tried
the
door
it
opened
under
his
but
noiselessly
and
to
the
extent
only
of
a
bare
inch
in
view
of
the
possibility
of
a
janitor
being
somewhere
about
detecting
no
sound
from
within
however
the
hawk
pushed
the
door
a
little
further
open
and
was
confronted
with
a
dimly
lighted
vestibule
and
a
long
still
more
dimly
lighted
corridor
beyond
there
was
no
one
in
sight
he
slipped
quick
and
silent
now
in
his
movements
darted
across
the
vestibule
and
into
the
corridor
halfway
along
the
corridor
he
halted
before
a
door
on
whose
glass
panel
he
could
just
make
out
the
words
isaac
kirschell
and
beneath
the
name
in
smaller
letters
the
intimation
that
the
entrance
was
next
door
the
hawk
decision
was
taken
in
the
time
it
required
to
produce
from
his
pocket
a
equipped
with
an
extensive
assortment
of
skeleton
keys
if
by
any
chance
he
should
be
disturbed
and
had
entered
by
the
designated
office
door
his
escape
would
be
cut
off
if
on
the
other
hand
he
entered
by
this
unused
door
and
left
it
unlocked
behind
him
he
would
still
be
quite
comfortably
the
master
of
the
situation
in
almost
any
emergency
the
door
seemed
to
offer
unusual
difficulties
even
when
unlocked
it
stuck
the
hawk
worked
at
it
by
the
sense
of
touch
alone
his
eyes
busy
with
sharp
glances
up
and
down
the
corridor
finally
succeeding
in
opening
it
a
little
way
it
was
only
to
find
it
blocked
by
some
obstruction
within
he
scowled
a
desk
probably
close
against
it
the
door
was
certainly
never
used
he
would
have
to
enter
by
the
other
one
after
all
he
had
reached
his
arm
inside
it
was
only
a
or
something
of
the
sort
he
lifted
it
aside
stepped
in
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
the
hawk
the
diminutive
little
affair
that
had
served
him
for
his
to
circle
his
surroundings
inquisitively
he
was
in
a
small
plainly
furnished
private
office
there
was
a
desk
two
chairs
and
a
filing
cabinet
also
there
were
two
doors
the
hawk
opened
the
one
at
his
left
and
peered
out
it
gave
on
what
was
presumably
the
general
office
and
at
the
upper
end
was
a
partition
with
the
name
mr
kirschell
upon
the
door
he
looked
at
the
panel
of
the
door
he
had
just
opened
it
bore
no
name
this
belongs
to
kirschell
secretary
probably
he
decided
the
other
door
from
here
opens
of
course
into
kirschell
private
office
wonder
what
isaac
kirschell
business
is
he
closed
the
door
leading
into
the
outer
office
and
moved
across
the
room
to
the
second
door
that
already
stood
wide
open
and
almost
directly
faced
what
he
had
taken
for
granted
was
the
secretary
desk
he
stepped
over
the
threshold
kirschell
sanctum
was
somewhat
more
elaborately
furnished
apart
from
a
rather
expensive
desk
in
the
centre
of
the
room
there
was
a
massive
safe
new
and
of
modern
design
a
heavy
rug
upon
the
floor
and
several
very
comfortable
holstered
chairs
a
washstand
the
metal
taps
highly
polished
and
a
mahogany
towel
rack
occupied
the
far
corner
the
hawk
inspected
the
safe
with
the
eye
of
a
connoisseur
scowled
unhappily
by
way
of
expressing
his
opinion
of
it
and
turned
to
the
desk
he
opened
a
drawer
and
picked
up
a
sheet
of
business
stationery
the
letterhead
read
isaac
kirschell
loans
mortgages
general
exchange
ho
ho
observed
the
hawk
sort
of
a
glorified
pawnbroker
eh
the
sheet
of
paper
was
shot
back
into
the
drawer
the
flashlight
was
on
the
instant
the
hawk
was
back
in
the
other
office
and
crouched
on
the
floor
behind
the
desk
some
one
had
halted
outside
in
the
corridor
before
the
main
office
door
and
now
a
key
was
turned
in
the
lock
the
door
was
opened
and
closed
footsteps
crossed
the
general
office
paused
for
a
moment
outside
kirschell
door
then
the
lights
in
kirschell
room
went
on
a
man
entered
tossed
his
hat
on
a
chair
and
sat
down
at
the
desk
it
was
obviously
kirschell
himself
through
the
wide
opening
between
the
ends
of
the
desk
that
sheltered
him
the
hawk
flat
on
the
floor
took
stock
of
the
other
the
man
was
rather
small
in
stature
with
a
thin
palish
face
sharp
restless
very
small
black
eyes
and
he
was
extremely
well
hawk
noted
the
dainty
little
boutonnière
in
the
lapel
of
the
man
coat
and
smiled
queerly
from
kirschell
face
he
glanced
at
the
face
of
kirschell
safe
then
back
at
kirschell
fingered
his
automatic
in
the
pocket
of
his
coat
the
hawk
however
made
no
further
kirschell
actions
suggested
that
it
would
be
unwise
the
man
though
apparently
occupied
with
some
mail
which
he
had
taken
from
his
pocket
kept
glancing
impatiently
at
his
watch
it
was
quite
evident
that
he
was
expecting
some
one
every
moment
the
hawk
frowned
perplexedly
the
message
that
night
even
when
deciphered
left
much
too
much
to
the
imagination
it
was
quite
possible
that
kirschell
was
to
be
relieved
of
his
cash
box
with
more
address
and
finesse
than
by
the
bald
expedient
of
ruining
kirschell
safe
this
appointment
for
instance
then
the
hawk
smiled
queerly
again
the
corridor
door
had
opened
and
closed
for
the
second
time
a
heavy
step
traversed
the
outer
office
and
a
man
hat
in
hand
in
cheap
store
clothes
stood
before
krischell
desk
mentioned
in
dispatches
said
the
hawk
very
softly
to
himself
i
guess
that
calhoun
so
that
the
you
late
calhoun
kirschell
greeted
the
other
sharply
five
minutes
late
i
have
put
myself
to
considerable
inconvenience
to
give
you
this
calhoun
hair
was
tossed
there
was
a
smudge
across
his
cheek
and
his
hands
were
grimy
as
though
he
had
just
come
from
work
he
was
a
big
man
powerfully
shouldered
his
grey
eyes
were
not
friendly
as
they
met
kirschell
i
could
help
it
he
said
shortly
i
been
up
the
line
all
day
i
told
you
i
could
get
here
until
about
this
well
all
right
all
right
said
kirschell
impatiently
but
now
that
you
are
here
are
you
prepared
to
settle
i
can
give
you
a
small
payment
on
account
that
the
best
i
can
do
calhoun
answered
kirschell
tilted
back
in
his
swivel
chair
and
frowned
as
he
tapped
the
edge
of
his
desk
with
a
paper
cutter
how
much
he
demanded
coldly
forty
dollars
hand
went
tentatively
toward
his
pocket
forty
dollars
there
was
derision
in
kirschell
voice
an
uninviting
smile
on
kirschell
lips
that
hardly
more
than
the
interest
yes
said
calhoun
snarling
suddenly
at
the
thieving
rates
you
and
the
bloodsuckers
like
you
kirschell
uninviting
smile
deepened
considering
the
security
the
rate
is
very
moderate
he
said
evenly
now
see
here
calhoun
i
told
you
plainly
enough
this
thing
had
to
be
settled
you
do
want
to
run
away
with
the
impression
that
i
a
second
marakof
to
be
staved
off
all
the
time
i
bought
your
note
from
the
pawnbroker
estate
because
the
executors
did
like
the
look
of
it
and
were
any
too
sure
they
could
collect
it
well
i
can
i
new
out
here
but
i
not
new
at
my
business
excuses
with
me
do
take
the
place
of
cash
i
hold
your
note
for
five
hundred
dollars
which
is
past
due
to
say
nothing
of
six
months
interest
you
come
here
and
offer
me
forty
dollars
i
would
have
paid
marakof
said
calhoun
in
a
low
voice
and
i
pay
you
as
fast
as
i
can
you
know
what
i
up
told
you
when
you
first
got
after
me
as
soon
as
you
got
that
note
my
brother
got
into
trouble
back
east
what
would
you
have
done
that
five
hundred
kept
him
out
of
the
he
only
a
kid
damn

do
play
the
shark
marakof
renewed
the
ca
you
because
i
do
do
business
that
way
said
curtly
calhoun
voice
grew
hard
how
much
did
you
pay
for
that
note
anyway
kirschell
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
did
say
i
was
taking
any
risk
with
you
he
replied
tersely
that
the
profit
on
my
risk
and
as
far
as
you
are
none
of
your
business
calhoun
shrugged
his
shoulders
in
turn
and
taking
a
small
roll
of
bills
from
his
pocket
smoothed
them
out
between
his
fingers
i
got
a
wife
and
i
got
kids
said
calhoun
slowly
and
doing
the
best
i
can
do
you
want
this
forty
or
not
it
depends
said
kirschell
tapping
again
with
his
paper
cutter
how
about
the
rest
i
pay
you
what
i
can
every
month
calhoun
answered
how
much
what
i
can
returned
calhoun
defiantly
the
two
men
eyed
each
other
for
a
then
kirschell
tossed
the
paper
cutter
down
on
the
desk
well
all
right
he
decided
ungraciously
i
take
a
chance
for
a
see
how
you
live
up
to
it
hand
it
over
and
give
you
a
calhoun
shook
his
head
i
do
trust
the
man
who
do
trust
me
he
said
gruffly
i
do
want
that
kind
of
a
receipt
you
indorse
the
payment
on
the
back
of
the
note
kirschell
if
you
want
this
what
inquired
kirschell
staring
you
heard
what
i
said
said
calhoun
coolly
i
in
the
hands
of
a
shark
and
i
know
it
that
plain
talk
is
it
but
kirschell
flared
up
angrily
calhoun
calmly
returned
the
money
to
his
pocket
suit
yourself
he
suggested
indifferently
i
ai
asking
for
anything
more
than
i
have
a
right
very
well
my
man
said
kirschell
icily
if
our
dealings
are
to
be
on
this
basis
i
hope
you
will
remember
that
the
basis
is
of
your
own
he
swung
around
in
his
chair
and
rising
walked
over
to
the
safe
and
then
for
the
first
time
the
hawk
moved
he
edged
silently
back
along
the
floor
until
far
enough
away
from
the
doorway
to
be
fully
protected
by
the
darkness
of
the
room
and
stood
up
kirschell
was
swinging
the
heavy
door
of
the
safe
open
the
cash
box
was
to
be
produced
lying
down
the
hawk
could
not
hope
to
see
its
contents
if
it
were
opened
on
the
desk
standing
up
he
might
be
able
to
form
a
very
good
idea
of
how
tempting
its
contents
would
prove
to
be
kirschell
took
a
steel
box
from
the
safe
and
returned
to
the
desk
he
opened
this
with
a
key
threw
back
the
the
hawk
stuck
his
tongue
in
his
cheek
a
few
papers
lay
on
the
it
was
crammed
to
overflowing
with
banknotes
kirschell
selected
one
of
the
papers
and
picked
up
a
pen
in
frigid
silence
but
the
hawk
was
no
longer
watching
the
scene
his
head
was
cocked
to
one
side
in
a
curious
listening
attitude
he
could
have
sworn
he
had
heard
the
outer
office
door
being
stealthily
opened
and
now
calhoun
was
his
voice
raised
noticeably
in
a
louder
tone
than
any
he
had
previously
employed
i
ai
looking
for
trouble
kirschell
he
stated
hurriedly
as
though
relenting
and
i
do
want
you
to
think
i
am
there
was
a
sharp
cry
from
kirschell
the
room
was
in
darkness
came
a
quick
step
running
in
from
the
outer
office
no
longer
stealthy
crash
of
a
toppling
gasping
moan
in
thud
of
a
falling
tense
whisper
all
right
i
got
it
the
steps
running
back
across
the
outer
closing
of
the
corridor
silence
the
hawk
had
backed
up
against
the
wall
of
the
room
calhoun
voice
rose
hoarsely
good
god
what
happened
where
the
switch
kirschell
answered
him
faintly
the
side
of
the
the
the
lights
went
on
again
and
the
hawk
leaned
intently
forward
calhoun
was
standing
now
in
the
doorway
between
the
outer
and
the
private
office
his
eyes
fixed
on
kirschell
the
swivel
chair
had
been
overturned
and
kirschell
a
great
crimson
stream
running
down
his
cheek
from
above
his
temple
was
struggling
to
his
knees
clutching
at
the
edge
of
the
desk
for
support
the
cash
box
was
gone
kirschell
eyes
swept
the
top
of
the
desk
haggardly
as
though
hoping
against
hope
he
gained
his
feet
lurching
unsteadily
a
crimson
drop
splashed
to
the
desk
my
chair
he
cried
out
weakly
help
me
calhoun
stepped
forward
mechanically
and
picked
up
the
chair
kirschell
dropped
into
it
you
hurt
calhoun
said
huskily
you
badly
hurt
yes
kirschell
answered
but
wait
the
police
thousand
my
cash
with
an
effort
he
reached
out
across
the
desk
for
the
telephone
pulled
it
toward
on
the
point
of
lifting
the
receiver
from
the
hook
slowly
drew
back
his
hand
a
strange
look
settled
on
his
face
a
sort
of
dawning
though
puzzled
comprehension
and
then
swaying
in
his
chair
his
lips
thinned
he
drew
his
hand
still
further
back
until
it
hovered
over
the
handle
of
the
desk
middle
drawer
his
eyes
on
calhoun
were
narrowing
you
devil
he
rasped
out
suddenly
this
is
your
work
i
was
a
fool
that
i
did
not
see
it
at
first
calhoun
face
went
white
what
do
you
mean
he
said
thickly
what
i
say
kirschell
voice
was
ominously
clear
now
though
he
sat
none
too
steadily
in
his
chair
then
you
lie
said
calhoun
fiercely
you
if
you
were
hurt
no
you
would
had
whipped
the
drawer
open
and
snatching
out
a
revolver
was
covering
calhoun
he
laughed
a
i
not
so
bad
that
i
ca
take
care
of
myself
it
was
pretty
clever
i
give
you
credit
for
that
you
almost
fooled
damn
you
snarled
calhoun
do
you
mean
to
say
i
got
your
cash
box
oh
no
said
kirschell
i
can
see
you
have
i
do
even
know
which
of
you
two
struck
me
but
i
do
know
that
you
and
the
man
who
has
my
cash
box
worked
up
this
plant
calhoun
stepped
forward
to
retreat
again
before
the
lifted
muzzle
of
the
revolver
you
a
fool
he
snarled
you
nothing
on
me
that
for
the
police
to
decide
returned
kirschell
evenly
it
would
have
been
a
pleasant
way
of
disposing
of
that
note
would
you
had
me
and
your
pal
for
his
share
i
daresay
was
to
take
his
chance
on
whatever
there
might
be
in
the
cash
box
why
did
you
say
you
could
come
until
night
when
i
gave
you
until
as
the
last
day
in
which
to
settle
why
did
you
insist
on
my
indorsing
the
payment
on
the
note
which
necessitated
my
opening
the
safe
and
taking
out
the
cash
box
in
which
you
knew
the
note
was
kept
for
you
saw
me
put
it
there
a
week
ago
when
you
first
came
here
and
just
after
i
was
knocked
down
i
heard
your
accomplice
whisper
right
i
got
it
possible
the
police
might
form
the
same
opinion
i
have
as
to
whom
those
words
were
addressed
calhoun
face
had
grown
whiter
it
a
lie
he
said
scarcely
above
a
whisper
it
a
lie
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
i
want
my
three
thousand
dollars
kirschell
lips
were
set
he
held
a
handkerchief
to
his
cheek
if
i
call
the
police
now
they
get
it
your
accomplice
that
got
my
money
and
it
my
money
that
i
want
i
give
you
half
an
hour
to
go
to
him
and
bring
the
money
back
leave
the
police
out
of
it
if
you
not
here
in
that
time
i
put
it
up
to
the
police
half
an
hour
is
time
enough
for
you
to
find
your
pal
and
it
not
time
enough
for
you
to
attempt
to
leave
the
get
very
far
kirschell
laid
his
watch
on
the
desk
you
better
mean
half
an
hour
from
calhoun
hung
hesitant
for
a
moment
staring
at
the
muzzle
of
kirschell
revolver
he
made
as
though
to
say
instead
abruptly
with
a
short
jarring
laugh
turned
on
his
heel
and
passed
out
of
the
room
the
hawk
was
already
edging
his
way
along
the
wall
toward
the
corridor
door
three
thousand
dollars
hawk
rolled
the
words
like
so
many
dainty
morsels
on
his
tongue
as
he
communed
with
himself
i
guess
it
my
play
to
stick
to
calhoun
of
the
little
spiders
the
hawk
reached
the
door
as
calhoun
stepped
into
the
corridor
from
the
general
office
and
passed
by
outside
evidently
making
for
the
main
entrance
of
the
building
he
opened
the
door
cautiously
the
width
of
a
held
it
in
that
position
a
man
voice
low
guarded
from
the
corridor
but
from
the
opposite
direction
to
that
taken
by
calhoun
reached
him
here
calhoun
here
calhoun
halted
there
was
silence
for
an
instant
then
calhoun
retraced
his
steps
and
passed
by
the
door
again
there
were
a
few
hurried
words
in
a
whisper
which
the
hawk
could
not
catch
and
then
the
footsteps
of
both
men
retreated
along
the
corridor
the
hawk
opened
the
door
wider
and
peered
out
the
two
men
were
well
down
the
corridor
now
and
now
as
they
passed
the
single
incandescent
that
lighted
that
end
of
the
hall
calhoun
companion
reached
up
and
turned
it
out
why
murmured
the
hawk
and
stepped
out
into
the
corridor
himself
it
was
now
quite
dark
at
that
end
and
the
men
had
disappeared
the
hawk
moved
silently
and
swiftly
along
keeping
close
to
the
wall
presently
he
caught
the
sound
of
their
voices
again
and
nodded
to
himself
he
remembered
that
in
going
out
this
way
yesterday
he
had
noticed
that
the
corridor
for
some
architectural
reason
made
a
sharp
jut
just
before
it
gave
on
the
entrance
he
stepped
now
across
to
the
other
side
of
the
corridor
and
stole
forward
to
a
position
where
he
could
look
diagonally
past
the
projecting
angle
of
the
jut
the
two
men
standing
there
showed
plainly
in
the
light
from
a
street
arc
that
shone
into
the
entranceway
through
the
large
square
over
the
door
the
hawk
quite
secure
from
observation
nestled
back
against
the
an
ominous
smile
settled
on
the
hawk
lips
the
face
of
calhoun
companion
was
covered
with
a
mask
there
nothing
to
be
leery
about
here
the
man
was
saying
there
no
one
goes
out
or
comes
in
this
way
at
night
well
a
nice
mess
eh
so
the
old
shylock
called
the
turn
on
you
did
he
there
seemed
to
be
a
helpless
note
in
calhoun
voice
he
passed
his
hand
heavily
across
his
eyes
what
the
meaning
of
this
he
cried
out
what
do
you
know
about
what
happened
in
there
nothing
much
said
the
other
coolly
except
that
i
the
guy
that
pinched
the
swag
and
hit
kirschell
that
welt
on
the
you
calhoun
involuntarily
stepped
back
yes
the
man
shrugged
his
shoulders
me
and
a
pal
who
was
outside
away
now
putting
the
cash
box
where
it
wo
come
to
any
he
be
back
pretty
the
hawk
lips
moved
number
three
and
number
seven
whispered
the
hawk
gently
do
understand
said
calhoun
dazedly
then
why
are
you
telling
me
this
and
why
are
you
staying
here
and
how
did
you
know
that
kirschell
accused
me
of
being
in
it
that
another
one
that
easy
announced
the
man
evenly
because
it
was
part
of
the
game
to
make
him
think
calhoun
seemed
to
stiffen
up
what
you
mean
you
getting
it
said
the
other
shortly
but
you
better
wait
until
you
get
it
all
before
you
start
spitting
your
teeth
out
mabbe
you
heard
of
a
little
interference
with
the
telegraph
wires
and
a
few
small
jobs
pulled
off
around
here
where
some
innocent
parties
accidentally
got
croaked
have
eh
well
that
where
you
come
in
calhoun
we
want
when
we
want
anything
we
get
it
see
we
knew
about
that
note
and
we
been
expecting
the
railroad
crowd
to
wake
up
some
time
and
we
had
you
picked
out
to
place
our
bets
on
against
them
they
woke
up
and
began
to
nose
over
the
line
it
ai
likely
to
do
them
much
good
but
there
a
we
ai
taking
chances
we
do
want
much
from
you
calhoun
just
a
little
thing
and
it
bring
you
more
money
than
you
ever
saw
in
your
life
before
and
without
you
running
any
risk
all
you
got
to
do
is
stand
for
anything
in
the
shape
of
a
splice
or
tap
on
the
line
that
they
suspicious
can
say
it
a
repair
job
of
your
own
see
an
angry
flush
was
tinging
calhoun
cheeks
is
that
all
he
burst
out
passionately
well
i
see
you
damned
first
will
you
returned
the
other
calmly
all
right
my
bucko
it
your
funeral
take
your
choice
twenty
years
in
the
penitentiary
you
in
cold
on
this
think
it
over
a
bit
for
instance
how
did
you
come
to
make
the
break
of
wanting
kirschell
to
indorse
the
payment
on
the
back
of
the
note
which
made
him
open
his
safe
how
do
you
know
i
did
calhoun
flashed
back
sharply
mabbe
i
only
guessing
at
it
said
the
man
nonchalantly
and
mabbe
i
was
back
in
the
outside
room
when
you
did
but
say
you
happen
to
remember
do
you
a
little
talk
you
had
with
a
stranger
up
the
line
and
how
the
conversation
got
around
to
loan
sharks
and
how
he
told
about
a
trick
they
had
of
giving
receipts
that
were
phony
and
how
he
beat
one
of
them
to
it
by
making
the
shark
indorse
on
the
paper
itself
kind
of
sunk
in
and
you
calhoun
we
do
do
things
by
halves
we
happen
to
need
you
and
what
do
you
think
i
made
the
break
of
whispering
so
kirschell
would
hear
me
for
the
color
was
ebbing
from
calhoun
face
it
not
proof
the
defiant
ring
in
his
voice
was
forced
it
enough
to
make
kirschell
believe
it
and
that
all
we
wanted
for
a
starter
we
take
care
of
the
rest
stated
the
man
grimly
what
did
he
say
to
you
calhoun
answered
mechanically
he
said
if
i
did
return
in
half
an
hour
with
the
cash
box
he
notify
the
oh
ho
the
man
lips
widened
in
a
grin
under
the
edge
of
his
mask
so
he
going
to
wait
here
eh
well
so
much
the
better
it
save
us
a
trip
to
his
house
now
see
here
calhoun
let
this
sink
in
he
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
drew
out
a
slip
of
paper
here
your
note
it
was
on
the
desk
where
kirschell
was
writing
on
it
and
i
pinched
it
when
i
pinched
the
cash
box
we
did
figure
we
were
going
to
make
the
haul
we
did
were
after
you
but
there
some
money
in
that
cash
box
as
you
saw
for
yourself
the
idea
kirschell
read
a
thing
or
two
about
what
going
on
around
to
make
him
know
that
there
ai
much
our
gang
stop
at
if
you
say
you
with
us
me
and
my
pal
go
in
there
and
throw
the
fear
of
god
into
him
do
you
get
it
think
himself
lucky
to
get
off
by
keeping
his
mouth
shut
about
when
he
finds
out
who
he
up
against
also
you
get
the
note
back
and
a
share
of
the
more
to
come
later
no
calhoun
cried
out
no
i
no
thief
all
right
agreed
the
other
indifferently
that
one
side
of
it
here
the
other
kirschell
certainly
believes
you
took
it
he
a
shark
all
right
and
he
thinks
more
of
his
money
than
he
does
of
anything
else
or
he
would
have
given
you
the
chance
he
did
but
when
you
do
show
back
there
with
the
coin
he
take
the
only
other
hope
he
got
of
getting
his
money
and
turn
on
the
police
what
are
you
going
to
do
then
make
a
break
for
it
or
let
get
you
well
it
does
matter
which
this
note
and
a
chunk
of
the
cash
gets
mailed
the
police
get
tipped
off
to
watch
your
mail
in
the
morning
kind
of
reasonable
is
it
your
pal
not
being
able
to
find
you
and
not
tumbling
to
the
fact
that
the
police
have
got
you
until
too
late
comes
across
with
your
share
like
an
honest
little
man
i
think
you
said
something
about
proof
calhoun
and
i
think
i
told
you
before
that
we
did
do
things
by
halves
how
about
that
on
top
of
kirschell
you
think
it
would
cinch
a
jury
or
do
you
think
they
believe
any
little
fairy
story
you
might
tell
them
say
about
meeting
me
does
it
look
any
more
like
twenty
years
than
it
did
there
was
a
sudden
agony
in
calhoun
face
my
god
he
whispered
would
do
that
the
man
made
no
answer
he
still
held
the
his
in
the
other
now
he
carelessly
dangled
a
revolver
you
would
you
would
calhoun
voice
was
broken
now
i
a
wife
and
children
god
what
am
i
to
do
that
kirschell
gave
you
is
slipping
along
suggested
the
other
uncompromisingly
here
the
note
and
there
easy
money
waiting
for
calhoun
turned
on
the
other
like
a
man
demented
do
you
think
i
touch
that
cash
or
touch
that
owe
it
i
may
not
have
been
able
to
pay
i
owe
it
oh
well
suit
yourself
as
to
that
too
said
the
man
cynically
it
the
other
thing
we
want
what
the
wife
and
the
kids
you
talking
about
going
to
do
if
you
go
up
for
twenty
years
calhoun
with
a
miserable
cry
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
there
was
minute
dragged
by
well
prompted
the
man
curtly
calhoun
dropped
his
hands
met
the
other
eyes
for
an
turned
his
head
away
ah
i
thought
you
would
said
the
man
calmly
my
pal
ought
to
be
back
by
now
and
as
soon
as
he
comes
we
go
in
there
and
hand
kirschell
his
little
jolt
he
stopped
there
was
a
light
rapping
on
the
entrance
door
here
he
is
now
the
hawk
was
retreating
back
along
the
corridor
again
he
opened
the
door
of
what
he
had
designated
to
himself
as
the
secretary
office
and
for
the
second
time
that
night
stepped
silently
into
the
room
closing
the
door
behind
him
the
sound
of
running
water
came
from
kirschell
private
office
but
there
was
no
other
hawk
made
none
as
he
once
more
gained
his
place
of
vantage
behind
the
desk
kirschell
was
bending
over
the
washbowl
his
back
turned
bathing
his
temple
and
face
and
now
straightening
up
he
bound
a
towel
tightly
around
his
head
the
hawk
watched
the
proceedings
impassively
his
head
in
that
listening
attitude
cocked
on
one
shoulder
toward
the
outer
door
steps
were
coming
along
the
corridor
but
this
time
kirschell
too
heard
he
turned
and
as
the
corridor
door
opened
started
toward
his
desk
he
reached
it
and
sat
down
as
calhoun
entered
the
room
ah
ha
snapped
kirschell
triumphantly
so
you
thought
better
of
it
have
you
i
imagined
you
would
well
the
words
seemed
to
freeze
on
his
lips
there
was
a
sudden
terror
in
his
face
does
this
mean
he
faltered
two
masked
men
the
one
who
had
been
with
calhoun
in
the
corridor
and
a
taller
more
heavily
built
man
had
stepped
in
behind
calhoun
and
were
advancing
toward
the
desk
the
short
man
pointed
a
revolver
at
kirschell
head
calhoun
says
he
keeps
a
gun
in
the
middle
drawer
of
the
desk
he
grunted
to
his
companion
get
it
the
other
leaning
over
pulled
the
drawer
open
and
appropriating
kirschell
revolver
stuck
it
in
his
pocket
kirschell
tongue
circled
his
lips
he
looked
wildly
from
one
to
the
other
we
just
dropped
in
to
make
a
confession
kirschell
said
the
short
man
with
an
ugly
jeer
we
do
like
to
see
an
innocent
man
i
the
one
that
lifted
your
cash
box
you
measly
and
my
pal
there
i
heard
you
trying
to
stick
it
on
calhoun
we
ai
asking
any
favours
for
ourselves
and
when
we
get
through
with
you
you
can
tell
the
police
it
was
us
and
that
we
part
of
the
crowd
that
been
making
things
lively
around
these
been
reading
the
papers
ai
you
you
open
your
mouth
about
calhoun
you
put
him
in
bad
when
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
and
inside
of
hours
you
be
found
in
a
dark
alley
somewhere
with
a
bullet
through
you
get
me
you
know
who
up
against
now
and
you
got
fair
warning
kirschell
was
huddled
in
his
chair
his
little
black
eyes
were
no
longer
were
fixed
in
a
sort
of
terrified
fascination
on
the
speaker
he
licked
his
lips
again
yes
understand
he
mumbled
from
his
pocket
the
hawk
took
a
mask
which
he
slipped
over
his
face
and
from
his
pocket
he
took
his
automatic
i
do
think
he
believes
you
sneered
the
second
masked
man
with
a
wicked
grin
perhaps
mabbe
we
better
twist
his
windpipe
a
little
just
to
show
him
in
a
friendly
way
that
there
ai
any
mistake
about
no
no
kirschel
voice
was
full
of
fear
no
no
i
his
words
ended
in
a
choked
scream
the
man
hands
had
shot
swiftly
out
and
closed
on
throat
he
was
shaking
twisting
and
turning
kirschell
head
from
side
to
side
his
companion
laughed
brutally
came
a
series
of
guttural
moans
from
kirschel
body
began
to
slip
limply
down
in
his
chair
calhoun
had
gone
white
to
the
lips
stop
it
my
god
stop
it
he
burst
out
frantically
you
promised
me
you
would
do
him
any
you
mind
your
own
business
snarled
the
man
with
the
revolver
we
know
how
to
handle
his
breed
give
him
enough
to
hold
him
for
a
while
jim
drop
that
revolver
drop
it
the
hawk
was
standing
in
the
doorway
there
was
a
startled
oath
from
the
leader
of
the
two
men
as
he
whirled
around
a
gasp
as
he
faced
the
hawk
his
weapon
clattered
to
the
floor
the
other
in
a
stunned
way
still
hung
over
kirschell
but
his
hands
had
relaxed
their
hold
on
kirschel
throat
thank
you
drawled
the
hawk
i
must
say
i
agree
with
calhoun
it
not
a
pleasant
sight
to
watch
a
man
being
his
voice
rang
suddenly
cold
you
there
his
automatic
indicated
the
man
beside
kirschell
stand
back
at
the
end
of
the
desk
and
put
up
your
hands
calhoun
had
not
moved
he
was
staring
numbly
at
the
hawk
kirschell
making
guttural
sounds
was
clawing
at
his
throat
mr
calhoun
requested
the
hawk
coolly
as
i
happen
to
know
that
you
have
little
reason
to
love
either
of
these
two
gentlemen
will
you
be
good
enough
to
pick
up
that
revolver
and
hand
it
to
me
calhoun
stooped
mechanically
and
extended
it
to
the
hawk
and
now
our
friend
over
there
with
his
hands
up
calhoun
purred
the
hawk
you
will
find
two
in
his
own
and
kirschell
kirschell
i
am
sure
is
already
fairly
well
convinced
that
you
are
in
no
way
connected
with
the
robbery
of
his
cash
box
and
i
am
equally
sure
that
in
no
way
could
you
better
dispel
any
lingering
doubts
he
might
still
entertain
than
by
helping
to
draw
these
gentlemen
calhoun
laughed
a
little
grimly
now
i
do
know
who
you
are
he
said
his
lips
set
as
he
started
toward
the
man
but
i
guess
you
right
i
like
to
see
them
get
what
coming
to
quite
so
said
the
hawk
pleasantly
he
accepted
the
two
remaining
revolvers
from
calhoun
and
from
his
pocket
produced
his
skeleton
keys
he
handed
them
to
calhoun
designating
one
of
the
keys
on
the
ring
one
more
request
calhoun
he
said
i
entered
by
the
door
that
opens
on
the
corridor
from
this
other
office
here
will
you
please
lock
it
and
on
your
way
back
also
lock
this
connecting
door
through
which
i
have
just
come
key
of
the
latter
i
noticed
is
in
the
calhoun
nodded
took
the
keys
and
stepped
quickly
from
the
room
kirschell
evidently
not
seriously
hurt
from
the
handling
he
had
received
though
still
choking
a
little
and
clearing
his
throat
with
short
coughs
was
regarding
the
hawk
with
a
questioning
stare
the
eyes
of
the
other
two
men
were
on
the
hawk
revolver
the
shorter
of
the
two
suddenly
raised
a
clenched
fist
the
hawk
he
flashed
out
furiously
you
cursed
snitch
wish
you
were
dead
before
we
through
with
you
so
the
butcher
told
me
last
the
hawk
smiled
plaintively
move
a
little
closer
together
you
like
that
at
the
far
end
of
the
desk
beside
each
other
thank
you
you
are
much
easier
to
cover
that
calhoun
returned
locking
the
connecting
door
behind
him
and
handed
the
door
key
together
with
the
back
to
the
hawk
the
hawk
moved
forward
to
the
desk
he
was
alert
quick
ominous
now
the
drawl
the
pleasantry
was
gone
out
there
in
the
hall
he
said
coldly
i
heard
calhoun
refuse
to
take
back
his
a
thief
you
revolver
muzzle
jerked
toward
the
short
hand
it
out
the
man
reached
viciously
into
his
pocket
and
tossed
the
note
on
the
desk
the
hawk
pushed
it
toward
kirschell
mr
kirschell
he
said
quietly
you
no
doubt
had
good
reasons
for
it
but
you
have
none
the
less
falsely
accused
calhoun
furthermore
calhoun
has
been
instrumental
in
laying
these
two
who
have
confessed
by
the
heels
under
the
circumstances
if
you
are
the
man
i
think
you
are
you
will
tear
that
kirschell
lingered
the
note
for
an
instant
he
looked
from
calhoun
to
the
hawk
and
back
at
calhoun
again
yes
he
said
tore
it
into
several
pieces
i
suppose
i
could
hardly
do
less
you
are
quite
right
and
calhoun
apologise
to
a
flush
spread
over
calhoun
face
he
swallowed
hard
and
his
lips
quivered
slightly
mr
kirschell
he
stammered
that
all
right
interposed
the
hawk
whimsically
start
any
mutual
admiration
society
i
dislike
embarrassing
situations
and
besides
calhoun
eyes
travelled
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
two
masked
i
think
you
had
better
go
go
repeated
calhoun
somewhat
bewilderedly
yes
supplemented
the
hawk
as
far
as
you
are
concerned
you
are
clear
and
out
of
this
now
stay
out
of
it
and
say
the
best
thing
you
can
well
that
suits
me
said
calhoun
with
a
wry
smile
if
exactly
i
see
approved
the
hawk
it
does
you
credit
but
kirschell
and
i
are
quite
capable
of
settling
with
these
two
and
you
can
thank
kirschell
further
if
you
i
not
here
you
please
calhoun
turned
and
walked
to
the
door
his
footsteps
echoed
back
from
the
general
office
then
the
corridor
door
closed
behind
him
the
hawk
addressed
the
two
masked
men
last
night
remarked
the
hawk
gently
it
was
the
butcher
and
it
me
was
close
in
front
of
the
two
now
and
with
a
jerk
snatched
the
masks
from
their
whitie
jim
and
the
bantam
well
i
might
have
known
from
the
butcher
you
all
out
of
the
same
kind
of
cocoons
the
poor
old
simp
at
the
head
of
your
gang
is
sure
stuck
with
a
lot
he
sure
collected
a
bunch
of
why
say
back
there
in
new
york
where
a
real
crook
could
keep
the
grin
off
his
face
every
time
he
met
you
even
the
police
had
you
passed
up
as
harmless
cripples
you
go
to
blazes
growled
the
bantam
with
an
oath
sing
through
the
other
side
of
your
mouth
for
this
yet
you
are
not
nice
to
me
bantam
said
the
hawk
in
a
pained
voice
you
do
appreciate
what
i
doing
for
you
it
was
a
piker
game
you
tried
to
hand
calhoun
but
even
at
that
i
would
have
queered
it
if
it
would
have
helped
you
work
out
a
few
more
little
deals
so
that
i
could
skim
the
cream
off
them
but
it
would
i
do
see
what
you
gain
by
interfering
with
the
telegraph
lines
but
i
let
you
in
on
something
i
been
keeping
an
eye
on
macvightie
because
macvightie
been
keeping
an
eye
on
me
and
i
overheard
him
talking
to
the
superintendent
macvightie
got
an
idea
that
fooling
with
the
wires
now
see
where
you
would
have
been
if
calhoun
had
ever
got
started
on
the
real
thing
some
of
you
would
have
been
say
there
nothing
like
that
going
to
happen
if
i
can
help
it
you
and
your
crowd
are
too
valuable
to
me
to
take
any
chances
of
your
getting
in
wrong
anywhere
i
not
wringing
the
neck
of
the
goose
that
lays
my
golden
eggs
tell
that
to
the
guy
that
supposed
to
have
the
brains
of
your
outfit
will
you
and
you
might
add
that
i
do
want
any
thanks
i
getting
well
you
get
paid
curse
you
the
bantam
voice
was
hoarse
with
fury
you
butted
in
once
too
often
last
night
the
butcher
warned
you
there
ai
any
more
warnings
you
got
the
drop
on
us
here
it
getting
late
said
the
hawk
wearily
and
i
sure
kirschell
agrees
with
me
that
it
is
about
time
to
produce
that
cash
you
not
kirschell
kirschell
made
no
reply
the
hawk
i
do
think
you
put
it
back
in
the
see
that
the
door
is
still
wide
open
a
drawer
in
the
desk
then
perhaps
you
there
was
a
sudden
deadly
coldness
in
the
hawk
voice
the
bantam
had
edged
around
the
corner
of
the
desk
if
any
of
you
move
another
inch
i
drop
you
as
quick
as
i
drop
a
mad
dog
now
the
cricket
will
oblige
i
give
him
until
i
count
three
damn
you
face
was
livid
and
contorted
he
wrenched
a
lower
drawer
open
and
flung
the
cash
box
on
the
desk
the
butcher
whitie
jim
the
bantam
and
the
cricket
murmured
the
hawk
it
good
to
see
old
new
york
faces
out
here
even
if
you
do
size
up
like
trying
to
bust
into
high
society
you
can
take
that
towel
off
if
you
like
cricket
it
does
become
you
as
you
washed
off
the
effect
of
that
little
bag
of
liquid
stain
you
smashed
over
your
temple
sure
you
look
less
like
a
comic
opera
star
no
well
please
yourself
the
hawk
was
coolly
transferring
the
contents
of
the
cash
box
to
his
pockets
with
his
left
hand
these
papers
mused
the
hawk
deliberately
aloud
appear
to
be
some
securities
you
lifted
on
that
pullman
car
raid
rather
neat
idea
this
establishing
this
of
a
clearing
house
i
take
it
for
the
mortgages
and
general
exchange
i
take
back
part
of
what
i
shows
a
first
faint
glimmer
of
brains
well
keep
the
office
going
your
interests
are
mine
you
notice
that
i
was
considerate
enough
to
get
calhoun
out
of
the
way
before
the
you
were
very
generous
magnanimous
even
admire
you
calhoun
swear
kirschell
is
the
squarest
man
on
do
forget
that
another
little
debt
of
gratitude
you
owe
the
hawk
three
thousand
dollars
the
hawk
pockets
were
bulging
must
have
been
what
you
separated
some
one
from
when
i
looking
glad
you
were
stingy
with
your
bait
for
calhoun
i
heard
that
kirschell
kept
a
good
deal
of
cash
in
his
safe
but
i
had
no
idea
that
kirschell
was
the
till
i
came
here
this
evening
to
take
a
look
at
kirschell
safe
i
must
say
it
has
been
a
very
pleasant
the
cash
box
was
empty
the
hawk
backed
away
from
the
desk
none
of
the
three
men
were
eying
him
like
caged
and
infuriated
beasts
the
hawk
reached
the
doorway
you
will
observe
smiled
the
hawk
engagingly
that
this
is
now
the
only
exit
and
that
as
i
walk
backward
across
the
outer
office
any
one
who
steps
into
this
doorway
will
be
directly
in
the
line
of
he
bowed
facetiously
backed
through
the
doorway
and
across
the
general
office
and
still
facing
the
inner
room
opened
the
corridor
door
and
stepped
out
and
then
the
hawk
spoke
again
i
bid
you
good
evening
gentlemen
said
the
hawk
softly
you
will
pardon
me
if
i
put
you
to
the
inconvenience
of
locking
this
the
or
alive
macvightie
had
become
troublesome
for
two
days
macvightie
had
very
seriously
annoyed
the
hawk
it
was
for
that
reason
that
the
hawk
now
crept
stealthily
up
the
dark
narrow
stairs
and
on
the
landing
listened
in
strained
attention
before
the
door
of
his
own
room
reassured
finally
he
opened
the
door
inch
by
inch
noiselessly
the
bolt
in
grooves
that
were
carefully
oiled
made
no
sound
in
slipping
into
place
as
the
hawk
entered
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
so
far
so
good
he
was
quick
alert
but
still
silent
as
in
the
darkness
he
crossed
swiftly
to
the
window
and
crouched
down
against
the
wall
a
minute
two
went
by
the
passing
at
an
angle
a
short
distance
below
the
window
sill
and
at
first
nebulous
in
the
blackness
gradually
took
on
distinct
and
tangible
shape
still
the
hawk
held
there
motionless
searching
it
with
his
then
abruptly
satisfied
that
it
sheltered
no
lurking
shadow
he
straightened
up
thrust
his
automatic
back
into
his
pocket
pulled
down
the
shade
and
turning
back
into
the
room
switched
on
the
light
macvightie
it
appeared
still
had
lingering
suspicions
of
this
room
over
the
somewhat
disreputable
saloon
below
and
still
had
lingering
suspicions
of
its
occupant
all
that
afternoon
the
hawk
was
quite
well
aware
that
he
had
been
the
result
had
been
rather
in
his
favour
than
in
from
the
moment
he
had
discovered
that
he
was
being
followed
he
had
devoted
his
time
to
making
applications
for
a
macvightie
being
the
reason
he
had
given
macvightie
for
his
presence
in
selkirk
later
on
when
it
had
grown
dark
having
business
of
his
own
he
had
left
satellite
standing
on
a
street
corner
somewhat
puzzled
just
which
way
to
turn
that
however
had
no
bearing
on
the
watch
that
had
been
or
might
be
at
the
present
moment
set
upon
this
room
the
hawk
in
apparent
abstraction
was
flipping
a
coin
up
in
the
air
and
catching
it
there
was
a
slight
frown
on
the
hawk
face
macvightie
suspicions
were
still
lingering
for
the
simple
reason
that
macvightie
utterly
at
sea
was
clutching
at
the
only
straw
in
sight
coin
slipped
through
the
hawk
fingers
and
fell
beside
his
trunk
he
stooped
to
pick
it
not
only
had
the
room
been
searched
but
the
trunk
had
been
opened
the
single
strand
of
hair
almost
indiscernible
against
the
brass
and
quite
innocently
caught
in
the
lock
was
broken
well
he
had
not
finished
that
mental
sentence
he
tucked
the
coin
into
his
pocket
and
standing
up
yawned
and
stretched
himself
with
the
toe
of
his
boot
he
lazily
pushed
a
chair
out
from
the
wall
the
chair
fell
over
the
hawk
picked
it
up
and
quite
casually
set
it
the
door
he
took
off
his
coat
and
flung
it
over
the
back
of
the
chair
the
hawk
face
was
greyer
now
as
it
set
in
rigid
lines
but
there
was
no
tremor
in
the
hand
that
inserted
the
key
in
the
lock
of
the
trunk
he
flung
back
the
his
eyes
for
an
instant
searched
the
room
again
sharply
the
window
shade
was
securely
drawn
the
coat
over
the
back
of
the
chair
completely
screened
the
keyhole
of
the
door
he
laughed
a
little
well
the
trunk
had
been
opened
had
macvightie
found
nothing
his
fingers
were
working
swiftly
deftly
now
around
the
inside
edges
of
the
lid
he
was
either
caught
here
cornered
at
macvightie
once
for
all
would
be
satisfied
and
as
far
as
macvightie
was
concerned
the
coast
would
hereafter
be
clear
the
hawk
dark
eyes
narrowed
the
square
under
jaw
crept
out
and
set
doggedly
it
had
been
a
close
call
perilously
close
that
other
night
when
he
had
taken
the
ten
thousand
dollars
from
the
paymaster
safe
and
macvightie
had
followed
him
here
to
this
room
he
had
pulled
the
wool
over
macvightie
eyes
for
the
macvightie
had
returned
to
the
old
trail
again
well
the
cards
were
on
the
table
now
and
it
was
a
gamble
that
was
grim
enough
either
he
was
quit
of
macvightie
could
even
count
on
macvightie
as
a
sort
of
sponsor
for
his
innocence
ah
the
ingeniously
fashioned
false
tray
in
the
curvature
of
the
lid
had
come
away
in
the
hawk
hands
he
was
safe
macvightie
had
missed
it
in
the
tray
untouched
where
he
had
left
them
lay
the
packages
of
banknotes
from
the
paymaster
safe
in
the
tray
still
glittered
the
magnificent
diamond
necklace
whose
theft
from
the
wife
of
his
excellency
the
governor
of
the
state
had
already
furnished
more
than
one
of
the
big
dailies
back
in
the
east
with
attractive
copy
for
their
sunday
editions
and
there
undisturbed
were
the
contents
of
isaac
kirschell
cash
box
a
trifling
matter
of
some
three
thousand
dollars
and
there
too
snugly
tucked
away
in
one
corner
was
the
bundle
of
crisp
new
counterfeit
bills
the
hawk
grinned
maliciously
as
his
eyes
rested
on
the
counterfeit
notes
the
one
he
had
sent
inscribed
with
his
compliments
to
macvightie
when
he
had
returned
the
otherwise
empty
paymaster
bag
to
the
detective
had
not
pleased
macvightie
quite
at
his
ease
now
the
hawk
fitted
the
false
top
back
into
the
lid
closed
the
trunk
locked
it
drew
a
chair
up
to
the
table
and
sat
down
with
macvightie
removed
as
a
possible
factor
of
interruption
there
was
another
and
very
pressing
little
matter
to
which
he
was
now
at
liberty
to
give
his
attention
he
produced
a
folded
sheet
of
paper
from
his
inside
vest
pocket
spread
it
out
on
the
table
before
him
and
inspected
it
with
a
sort
of
cynical
curiosity
in
each
corner
were
tack
holes
he
had
removed
it
less
than
half
an
hour
through
any
misguided
dislike
to
publicity
but
simply
because
he
had
urgently
required
a
piece
of
a
conspicuous
position
on
the
wall
of
the
railroad
station
it
was
a
police
circular
the
hawk
had
not
before
had
an
opportunity
to
absorb
more
than
the
large
type
filled
his
pipe
calmly
now
as
he
read
it
in
its
entirety
sing
convict
five
thousand
dollars
reward
will
be
paid
for
information
leading
to
the
arrest
and
conviction
of
the
hawk
alias
harry
maul
here
followed
a
description
tallying
with
the
one
given
by
macvightie
to
lanson
the
division
superintendent
and
which
lanson
had
caustically
remarked
would
not
fit
more
than
thousand
men
in
selkirk
city
followed
after
that
a
résumé
of
the
crimes
recently
committed
on
the
railroad
amongst
them
the
theft
of
the
diamond
necklace
and
the
robbery
of
the
paymaster
safe
and
at
the
end
in

again
reward
two

reward
will
also
be
paid
for
information
leading
to
the
arrest
and
conviction
of
each
and
every
one
of
the
confederates
the
hawk
smiled
broadly
as
he
held
the
flame
of
a
match
to
his
pipe
bowl
the
last
paragraph
was
exquisitely
ironical
those
whom
macvightie
so
blithely
called
the
hawk
confederates
were
vying
with
each
other
at
that
exact
moment
and
for
the
exact
amount
of
two
thousand
dollars
offered
by
the
master
spider
of
the
gang
for
the
privilege
of
putting
an
even
more
conclusive
the
shape
of
a
knife
thrust
a
bullet
or
a
the
hawk
and
said
the
hawk
softly
as
he
turned
the
circular
over
i
guess
they
make
it
a
whole
lot
more
if
they
knew
that
i
the
back
of
the
circular
was
covered
with
line
after
line
of
what
seemingly
was
but
a
meaningless
jumble
of
scribbled
in
this
case
were
the
letters
any
too
well
formed
the
hawk
had
laboured
under
difficulties
when
the
telegraph
sounder
had
broke
unexpectedly
with
the
message
he
had
been
he
was
always
listening
when
within
sound
of
a
telegraph
he
had
never
known
a
message
from
the
wire
devils
to
come
through
at
so
early
an
hour
in
the
evening
before
he
had
shaken
macvightie
man
off
the
trail
and
had
gone
down
to
the
depot
intending
to
go
up
the
line
to
the
first
small
station
where
with
little
chance
of
being
discovered
he
could
spend
the
night
within
earshot
of
the
operator
the
hope
that
his
vigil
would
not
as
it
sometimes
did
prove
futile
he
had
been
standing
under
the
dispatcher
open
window
waiting
for
a
train
when
the
police
circular
tacked
on
the
station
wall
had
caught
his
eye
the
large
type
was
readily
decipherable
but
the
platform
lights
were
poor
and
he
had
stepped
closer
to
read
the
instead
glancing
quickly
about
him
to
see
that
he
was
not
observed
he
had
snatched
the
circular
from
the
wall
and
whipping
a
pencil
from
his
pocket
had
scrawled
on
the
reverse
side
as
best
he
could
the
message
that
was
rattling
in
over
the
dispatcher
sounder
from
the
room
above
he
had
taken
he
had
played
in
luck
no
one
had
noticed
him
he
was
here
now
with
the
message
and
since
it
must
sooner
or
later
have
been
put
to
the
proof
in
any
case
he
was
back
here
too
to
find
that
he
was
quit
of
macvightie
yes
confided
the
hawk
to
himself
as
he
reached
for
a
blank
sheet
of
paper
in
the
drawer
of
the
table
i
guess
i
played
in
ways
wonder
if
there
another
ripe
little
melon
here
going
to
be
shoved
my
way
on
a
gold
platter
by
the
butcher
and
his
crowd
the
hawk
studied
the
cipher
for
a
moment
lqrtvy
key
letter
stroke
at
six
he
murmured
he
drew
the
fresh
sheet
of
paper
toward
him
and
began
to
work
busily
occasionally
he
paused
staring
dubiously
at
a
had
taken
the
message
under
far
from
ideal
conditions
and
a
mistake
here
and
there
if
not
fatal
was
annoying
and
confusing
finally
however
the
hawk
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
whistled
low
under
his
breath
the
message
deciphered
and
arranged
into
words
and
sentences
ran

again
the
hawk
whistled
low
under
his
for
the
second
time
reached
into
his
inside
vest
pocket
he
took
out
a
letter
that
was
addressed
care
of
general
delivery
to
carrister
the
hawk
puffed
pleasantly
at
his
pipe
as
he
read
it
dear
friend
the
folks
are
all
well
and
hope
you
are
the
same
i
have
had
time
to
write
much
lately
i
like
my
new
job
fine
say
i
felt
like
a
fifth
avenue
dook
for
about
umpty
seconds
one
of
the
fellows
in
the
office
let
me
hold
a
package
of
diamonds
in
my
hand
just
to
see
what
it
felt
like
gee
say
you
could
almost
shove
it
in
your
vest
pocket
and
it
was
invoiced
through
customs
at
twenty
thousand
plunks
they
were
unset
stones
and
came
in
from
amsterdam
it
made
me
feel
queer
i
would
like
to
be
the
fellow
that
has
to
keep
his
eye
on
it
any
of
the
way
from
here
to
san
francisco
where
it
going
by
express
if
you
see
any
bright
lights
flashing
around
your
burg
that
you
ca
account
for
about
next
wednesday
night
you
know
it
the
diamonds
going
through
in
the
safe
i
getting
to
be
some
joker
eh
we
all
went
down
to
coney
last
sunday
it
been
fierce
and
hot
here
say
do
be
a
clam
write
us
a
line
well
i
guess
there
ai
any
more
news
yours
truly
the
hawk
instead
of
folding
up
the
letter
and
returning
it
to
his
pocket
began
meditatively
to
tear
it
into
minute
shreds
and
with
it
the
police
circular
and
the
sheet
of
paper
on
which
he
had
worked
out
the
cipher
message
the
fast
mail
scheduled
selkirk
at
this
was
wednesday
night
twenty
thousand
dollars
said
the
hawk
gently
under
his
breath
thanks
bud
old
boy
you
were
there
with
the
goods
all
right
but
it
was
a
job
and
i
did
think
there
was
going
to
be
anything
the
hawk
grinned
at
the
ceiling
and
just
as
i
was
about
passing
up
the
last
check
here
they
go
and
fix
it
for
me
to
scoop
the
whole
pot
three
miles
east
of
burke
siding
eh
the
hawk
relapsed
into
silence
for
a
moment
then
he
spoke
again
yes
said
the
hawk
i
guess
that
ought
to
work
she
make
the
three
miles
from
the
siding
under
five
or
six
minutes
due
at
burke
at
i
can
make
it
on
the
local
out
of
here
at
twenty
thousand
unset
stones
just
as
good
as
a
lot
easier
to
carry
the
hawk
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
five
minutes
of
eight
he
rose
leisurely
from
his
chair
stooped
for
a
precautionary
inspection
of
the
trunk
lock
put
on
his
coat
and
moving
toward
the
door
switched
off
the
light
if
i
get
away
with
this
observed
the
hawk
as
he
went
down
the
stairs
and
let
himself
out
through
the
street
door
it
be
for
keeps
if
any
of
the
gang
ever
pick
up
my
they
wo
quit
until
they
do
and
then
there
macvightie
and
the
police
i
guess
there
be
some
little
to
oh
well
shrugged
his
i
guess
i
get
a
bite
of
supper
no
telling
when
i
have
a
chance
to
eat
again
in
the
web
it
was
not
far
to
the
through
the
lane
from
the
palace
close
to
the
station
he
remembered
there
was
a
little
house
that
was
generally
patronised
by
the
railroad
men
old
mother
barrett
house
they
called
it
she
was
the
wife
of
an
engineer
who
had
been
killed
he
had
heard
and
she
had
a
boy
working
somewhere
on
the
railroad
not
that
he
was
interested
in
these
details
in
fact
as
he
walked
along
the
hawk
was
not
interested
in
old
mother
barrett
in
a
personal
sense
at
as
he
reached
the
house
and
entered
his
eyes
as
though
magnetically
drawn
in
that
direction
fixed
instantly
on
the
little
old
woman
behind
the
counter
the
hawk
was
suddenly
very
much
interested
in
old
mother
barrett
it
was
not
that
she
made
a
somewhat
pathetic
figure
that
she
drooped
a
little
at
the
shoulders
that
her
face
under
her
grey
hair
looked
tired
or
that
though
scrupulously
neat
her
clothes
were
a
little
was
none
of
these
was
old
mother
hands
that
for
the
moment
concerned
the
hawk
she
was
in
the
act
of
adjusting
her
spectacles
and
picking
up
a
very
new
and
crisp
bill
that
a
customer
from
the
stool
in
front
of
her
had
evidently
tendered
in
payment
for
his
meal
the
hawk
shot
a
quick
glance
up
and
down
the
room
there
were
several
other
customers
at
the
long
counter
but
the
stool
beside
the
owner
of
the
bill
was
the
hawk
unostentatiously
straddled
it
he
glanced
casually
at
the
man
at
his
elbow
allowed
his
eyes
to
stray
to
the
kindly
motherly
old
face
with
its
grey
irish
eyes
that
was
puckered
now
in
a
sort
of
hesitant
glanced
a
little
more
than
casually
at
the
banknote
she
kept
turning
over
and
over
in
her
hands
no
he
had
not
been
mistaken
it
was
one
of
those
counterfeits
which
according
to
macvightie
had
flooded
the
east
and
were
now
making
their
appearance
in
selkirk
and
it
was
a
duplicate
of
those
in
the
false
tray
of
his
trunk
his
eyes
perhaps
were
sharper
than
old
mother
any
case
his
identification
was
the
quicker
for
his
gaze
had
wandered
to
the
coffee
urn
and
he
was
drumming
idly
on
the
counter
with
his
finger
tips
before
the
little
old
woman
finally
spoke
afraid
i
ca
take
this
she
said
slowly
handing
the
banknote
back
across
the
counter
what
the
matter
with
it
demanded
the
man
gruffly
counterfeit
she
said
a
little
anxiously
as
though
she
were
fearful
of
giving
offence
the
hawk
eyes
with
mild
and
quite
impersonal
interest
were
on
the
man
face
now
the
man
had
picked
up
the
bill
and
was
pretending
to
examine
it
critically
counterfeit
echoed
the
man
shortly
say
what
are
you
giving
us
it
as
good
as
wheat
give
me
my
change
and
let
me
get
in
a
hurry
he
pushed
the
bill
toward
her
again
she
did
not
pick
it
up
from
the
counter
this
time
i
she
seemed
genuinely
disturbed
and
the
sweet
old
face
was
full
of
sympathy
i
sure
you
did
not
know
that
it
was
not
good
and
ten
dollars
is
a
great
deal
to
lose
is
it
too
bad
do
you
remember
where
you
got
it
look
here
you
dippy
snapped
the
man
i
tell
you
not
counterfeit
anyway
it
all
i
got
if
you
want
your
pay
take
it
you
owe
me
cents
but
i
ca
take
it
out
of
she
shook
her
head
in
a
troubled
way
this
is
a
you
seem
to
be
pretty
well
counterfeits
sneered
the
man
offensively
how
do
you
know
it
a
because
i
seen
one
like
this
before
she
said
simply
my
son
showed
me
one
the
last
time
he
was
in
from
his
run
and
he
warned
me
to
be
careful
about
taking
oh
your
sneered
the
man
again
some
son
wised
you
up
did
he
carries
it
around
with
and
who
does
he
shove
it
off
on
there
was
a
queer
little
sound
from
the
old
a
quick
hurt
catch
of
her
breath
the
hawk
eyes
travelled
swiftly
to
her
face
she
had
turned
a
little
pale
and
her
lips
were
she
was
drawn
up
very
proudly
and
the
thin
shoulders
were
squared
back
i
love
my
boy
she
said
in
a
low
voice
and
tears
came
suddenly
into
her
eyes
i
love
him
with
all
my
heart
but
i
should
a
thousand
times
rather
see
him
dead
than
know
him
for
a
thief
and
a
man
who
attempts
to
pass
these
things
knowingly
is
i
have
been
very
respectful
to
you
sir
and
i
do
not
deserve
what
you
have
said
i
assumed
that
you
had
been
swindled
yourself
and
that
you
were
perfectly
honest
in
offering
the
bill
to
me
but
now
from
what
the
trouble
mother
barrett
big
railroader
farther
up
the
counter
had
laid
down
his
knife
and
fork
and
swung
round
on
his
stool
with
a
hurried
glance
in
that
direction
the
man
hastily
thrust
the
counterfeit
note
into
his
pocket
laid
down
cents
on
the
with
a
dive
across
the
room
disappeared
through
the
door
the
hawk
stared
thoughtfully
after
him
i
could
butt
in
on
that
and
hand
him
one
said
the
hawk
to
himself
almost
apologetically
not
with
twenty
thousand
in
sight
i
could
afford
to
get
into
a
row
and
maybe
miss
the
local
and
spill
the
beans
could
i
he
looked
around
again
to
find
the
little
old
woman
wiping
her
spectacles
and
smiling
at
him
a
little
wistfully
i
sorry
that
you
had
to
listen
to
any
unpleasantness
she
said
my
little
place
is
very
pretentious
but
i
would
not
like
to
have
you
a
stranger
think
that
sort
of
thing
was
customary
here
what
can
i
get
you
sir
it
was
no
wonder
that
the
railroaders
evidently
swore
by
old
mother
barrett
and
that
one
of
them
had
been
quick
to
shift
her
trouble
to
his
own
shoulders
i
guess
he
was
a
bad
one
all
right
growled
the
hawk
she
shook
her
head
regretfully
there
was
no
resentment
was
as
though
indeed
the
man
was
a
charge
upon
her
own
conscience
he
meant
to
be
dishonest
i
am
afraid
she
admitted
reluctantly
but
i
am
sure
he
can
not
be
thoroughly
bad
for
he
was
very
a
young
she
was
a
very
simple
trusting
little
old
well
as
a
sweet
little
old
lady
why
should
her
illusions
be
dispelled
the
hawk
nodded
gravely
perhaps
suggested
the
hawk
perhaps
he
has
had
any
one
to
keep
him
straight
perhaps
he
has
got
what
keeps
a
good
many
chaps
good
the
mist
was
quick
in
her
eyes
again
he
had
not
meant
to
bring
had
meant
only
to
show
her
a
genuine
admiration
and
respect
perhaps
not
she
answered
slowly
but
if
he
has
i
hope
she
will
never
she
shook
her
head
again
and
then
but
you
have
not
told
me
yet
what
you
would
like
sir
the
hawk
gave
his
order
he
ate
mechanically
back
in
his
mind
he
was
reviewing
a
rather
extensive
acquaintanceship
with
certain
gentry
whose
morals
were
not
wholly
above
reproach
failing
however
to
identify
the
individual
with
the
counterfeit
note
as
one
of
this
select
number
he
finally
dismissed
the
man
somewhat
contemptuously
from
his
mind
just
a
piker
crook
i
guess
decided
the
hawk
i
like
to
have
found
out
though
how
many
more
of
those
he
got
and
who
the
fool
was
that
let
an
amateur
skate
like
that
loose
with
any
of
the
goods
he
finished
his
meal
paid
his
bill
smiled
a
goodnight
to
old
mother
barrett
walked
out
of
the
house
and
made
his
way
over
to
the
station
five
minutes
later
having
purchased
a
magazine
the
hawk
with
a
ticket
in
his
pocket
for
a
station
a
number
of
miles
beyond
burke
siding
curled
himself
up
with
his
pipe
on
a
seat
in
the
smoker
of
the
local
the
train
started
and
the
hawk
apparently
became
immersed
in
his
magazine
the
hawk
however
though
he
turned
a
page
from
time
to
time
was
concerned
with
matters
very
far
removed
from
the
printed
words
before
him
the
game
was
more
hazardous
more
difficult
and
for
a
vastly
greater
stake
than
any
in
which
he
had
before
pitted
his
wits
or
played
his
lone
hand
against
the
combined
brains
of
the
butcher
his
fellows
and
their
unknown
leader
who
collectively
were
referred
to
by
the
papers
wire
devils
the
hawk
tamped
down
the
ash
in
the
bowl
of
his
pipe
with
a
wary
forefinger
he
the
hawk
according
to
macvightie
was
the
leader
of
this
ingenious
criminal
league
it
was
very
complimentary
of
between
macvightie
and
the
wire
devils
themselves
he
was
a
personage
much
sought
after
macvightie
however
was
not
without
grounds
for
his
assertion
and
hawk
grinned
the
hawk
had
certainly
and
for
some
time
back
helped
himself
to
the
leader
share
of
the
spoils
and
helped
himself
very
generously
the
grin
died
away
he
had
beaten
them
so
far
appropriated
from
under
their
very
noses
the
loot
they
had
so
carefully
planned
to
obtain
and
he
had
mocked
and
taunted
them
contemptuously
in
the
doing
of
it
but
the
cold
fact
remained
that
luck
sometimes
was
known
to
turn
and
that
the
pitcher
that
went
too
often
to
the
well
ran
the
risk
of
if
they
ever
caught
him
his
life
would
not
be
worth
an
instant
purchase
he
knew
some
of
them
and
he
knew
them
well
for
what
they
were
and
he
laboured
under
no
delusions
on
that
score
the
butcher
for
example
who
was
the
number
one
of
the
message
had
already
nearly
done
for
him
once
and
the
butcher
had
nothing
on
number
three
who
was
the
bantam
or
on
number
seven
who
was
whitie
it
was
safe
to
presume
on
any
of
the
others
that
he
had
not
yet
number
four
and
number
six
for
instance
who
were
mentioned
in
the
cipher
message
and
how
many
more
were
there
he
did
not
that
there
was
the
master
spider
of
them
all
the
hawk
had
ceased
now
even
to
turn
cursorily
the
pages
of
the
magazine
he
was
staring
out
of
the
window
i
wonder
muttered
the
hawk
grimly
when
i
run
up
against
him
and
who
he
is
and
where
the
head
office
is
he
nodded
his
head
after
a
moment
macvightie
had
called
the
turn
the
wire
devils
formed
as
powerful
and
dangerous
a
criminal
organisation
as
had
probably
ever
existed
anywhere
and
not
for
very
long
would
they
put
all
their
resources
at
work
to
pull
off
some
coup
only
to
find
that
he
the
hawk
had
made
use
of
their
preparations
to
snatch
the
prize
away
from
them
they
were
much
more
likely
to
put
all
their
resources
at
the
hawk
as
their
sole
objective
the
hawk
lips
tightened
he
might
but
he
could
not
exaggerate
his
danger
the
man
in
the
seat
behind
him
might
be
one
of
them
for
all
he
knew
somewhere
hidden
away
in
his
web
at
the
end
of
a
telegraph
wire
was
the
master
spider
directing
the
operations
and
there
must
be
very
many
of
little
all
over
the
division
where
there
was
a
telegraph
sounder
that
sounder
carried
the
messages
the
plans
the
secret
orders
of
the
brain
behind
the
organisation
and
the
very
audaciousness
with
which
they
made
themselves
free
of
the
railroad
telegraph
system
to
communicate
with
each
other
was
in
itself
a
guarantee
of
success
if
one
of
their
messages
was
interfered
with
they
threatened
to
cut
the
wires
and
that
meant
if
luckily
it
meant
no
more
that
train
operating
was
at
an
end
until
the
break
could
be
located
and
repaired
were
they
tapping
the
wire
somewhere
what
chance
was
there
to
find
out
where
there
were
hundreds
of
old
splices
on
the
wires
or
if
found
what
would
prevent
them
tapping
the
wire
on
the
next
occasion
many
miles
away
also
the
sources
of
information
that
they
tapped
must
be
how
for
instance
unless
they
too
had
a
bud
back
there
in
new
york
did
they
know
of
this
diamond
shipment
coming
through
the
hawk
lips
grew
still
a
little
tighter
his
safety
so
far
had
depended
on
the
fact
that
he
possessed
the
key
to
their
cipher
messages
which
not
only
enabled
him
to
reap
where
they
had
sown
but
warned
him
of
any
move
they
might
make
against
him
but
it
was
becoming
increasingly
difficult
to
intercept
those
messages
he
had
macvightie
to
thank
for
that
where
before
he
had
only
to
crawl
into
some
little
where
there
was
no
night
operator
macvightie
now
had
every
one
of
those
stations
securely
guarded
yes
it
had
become
exceedingly
more
difficult
if
only
he
could
find
out
where
those
messages
emanated
from
or
the
system
in
force
for
receiving
them
the
hawk
slid
further
down
in
his
seat
tossed
the
magazine
to
one
side
pulled
his
hat
over
his
eyes
and
appeared
to
sleep
all
that
was
neither
here
nor
he
had
the
message
he
had
not
yet
got
that
twenty
thousand
dollars
in
unset
stones
he
would
perhaps
do
well
now
that
he
had
the
leisure
to
give
the
details
of
that
matter
a
little
more
critical
attention
than
they
had
received
when
he
had
made
up
his
mind
that
his
best
chance
lay
in
the
three
miles
between
burke
siding
and
the
point
where
the
butcher
and
his
men
planned
to
hold
up
the
train
according
to
the
message
the
implication
was
that
there
would
be
nobody
in
the
express
car
at
that
time
except
a
drugged
messenger
and
now
somehow
he
did
not
quite
like
the
appearance
of
that
it
seemed
a
little
queer
what
was
the
object
of
drugging
the
man
if
they
did
not
take
immediate
advantage
of
it
he
pondered
the
problem
for
a
long
time
no
after
all
it
was
logical
they
meant
to
remove
the
safe
bodily
there
evidently
was
not
a
specialised
cracksman
amongst
them
who
had
lifted
his
profession
to
the
plane
of
art
no
such
such
as
himself
the
hawk
opened
his
eyes
sleepily
to
inspect
the
tips
of
his
carefully
manicured
fingers
otherwise
with
no
one
to
interfere
but
a
drugged
messenger
they
could
have
opened
the
safe
looted
it
and
since
the
fast
mail
carried
only
through
express
matter
have
slipped
away
from
the
car
at
the
first
stop
with
no
one
being
the
wiser
until
somewhere
up
the
line
the
messenger
returned
to
life
and
gave
the
alarm
yes
it
was
very
craftily
worked
out
the
master
spider
was
far
from
a
fool
they
would
have
to
soup
the
safe
and
blow
it
open
if
they
attempted
that
while
the
train
was
en
route
they
ran
the
risk
of
being
heard
and
trapped
like
rats
in
the
car
and
if
they
were
heard
even
if
they
managed
to
stop
the
train
and
make
their
escape
they
invited
instant
and
definite
pursuit
on
the
spot
the
reason
for
drugging
the
express
messenger
became
quite
evident
now
if
the
man
were
already
helpless
when
they
held
up
the
train
they
at
one
and
the
same
time
assured
their
access
to
an
otherwise
guarded
car
without
danger
to
themselves
and
without
danger
of
being
balked
at
the
last
moment
of
their
the
messenger
with
a
small
package
like
that
might
easily
have
been
able
to
accomplish
if
he
were
a
game
man
he
could
have
opened
the
safe
say
the
instant
the
first
alarm
came
as
they
tried
to
force
the
car
door
taken
out
the
package
and
secreted
it
somewhere
it
needed
only
the
nerve
after
that
to
defy
them
and
they
had
evidently
given
him
credit
for
it
whether
he
possessed
it
or
not
yes
decidedly
the
master
spider
was
no
fool
in
the
spinning
of
his
web
as
it
was
the
safe
which
would
only
be
a
small
affair
anyhow
would
disappear
bodily
and
between
the
point
where
the
train
was
held
up
and
the
point
where
they
finally
left
the
engine
and
express
car
there
would
be
a
distance
of
at
least
ten
miles
even
allowing
that
they
approached
no
nearer
than
within
two
miles
of
bradley
the
first
station
west
of
burke
siding
with
the
wires
cut
and
the
coaches
of
the
fast
mail
stalled
three
miles
out
of
burke
considerable
time
must
elapse
before
any
one
could
make
a
move
against
them
and
even
when
the
pursuit
finally
started
macvightie
for
instance
would
be
confronted
with
that
somewhat
illusive
stretch
of
ten
miles
in
which
to
decide
where
the
pursuit
should
begin
ten
miles
was
some
little
distance
macvightie
would
be
quite
at
liberty
to
make
his
guess
and
there
was
the
chance
with
the
trifling
odds
of
some
few
odd
thousand
to
one
against
it
that
he
might
guess
he
guessed
that
the
safe
had
been
removed
at
the
point
where
the
engine
and
car
were
finally
left
in
which
case
macvightie
would
guess
wrong
if
the
hawk
was
asleep
he
was
perhaps
the
hawk
smiled
the
chances
were
just
about
those
few
odd
thousand
to
one
that
macvightie
would
guess
exactly
that
yes
it
was
an
exceedingly
neat
little
web
that
the
master
spider
had
spun
if
he
the
hawk
were
permitted
to
make
a
guess
he
would
guess
that
the
safe
would
never
be
found
his
mind
reverted
to
the
cipher
message
the
safe
was
to
be
delivered
at
where
that
was
the
hawk
did
not
that
it
must
necessarily
be
somewhere
between
the
point
where
the
train
was
held
up
and
bradley
however
that
was
a
detail
with
which
he
need
hardly
concern
himself
long
before
this
crossing
was
reached
his
vest
pocket
if
he
played
in
luck
would
be
very
comfortably
lined
he
would
enter
the
express
car
as
the
fast
mail
pulled
out
of
burke
siding
trust
to
certain
long
and
intimate
experience
to
open
the
get
off
the
train
as
it
slowed
down
at
the
butcher
very
thoughtful
request
for
the
rest
the
must
govern
there
in
the
main
that
would
be
his
plan
the
hawk
slept
on
station
after
station
was
passed
his
mind
now
dealt
in
little
snatches
of
thought
there
was
macvightie
and
the
police
circular
and
the
search
of
his
room
that
day
and
speculation
as
to
how
they
had
managed
to
drug
the
express
messenger
and
the
man
with
the
counterfeit
bill
in
old
mother
barrett
house
and
the
little
old
woman
herself
with
her
shabby
clothes
and
her
tired
gentle
finally
the
hawk
stirred
glanced
at
his
watch
and
as
the
train
whistled
picked
up
his
magazine
and
sauntered
down
the
car
aisle
to
the
door
they
were
approaching
burke
siding
the
hawk
opened
the
door
went
out
on
the
platform
and
descended
to
the
lowest
step
the
train
slowed
a
loomed
up
the
hawk
dropped
to
the
ground
a
minute
later
as
the
winked
by
and
came
to
a
stop
at
the
station
a
short
distance
down
the
track
he
had
made
his
way
back
to
the
crossed
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
track
and
stretched
himself
out
on
the
grass
in
the
hollow
at
the
foot
of
the
embankment
the
fast
mail
sole
excuse
for
a
stop
at
burke
siding
was
the
would
bring
the
express
car
to
a
halt
directly
in
front
of
the
spot
where
he
now
lay
the
local
pulled
out
and
racketed
away
into
the
night
the
vanished
silence
fell
there
was
only
the
chirping
of
the
insects
now
and
the
strange
queer
indefinable
medley
of
little
burke
siding
was
a
lonely
place
there
was
a
faint
yellow
gleam
from
the
station
windows
and
there
was
the
twinkle
of
the
switch
other
sign
of
life
it
was
pitch
black
that
the
hawk
could
just
barely
distinguish
the
outline
of
the
across
the
track
it
a
nice
night
observed
the
hawk
pleasantly
to
himself
a
very
nice
night
it
strange
how
some
people
prefer
a
moon
looting
of
the
fast
mail
the
minutes
went
by
ten
fifteen
twenty
of
half
then
from
far
down
the
track
hoarse
through
the
night
came
the
scream
of
a
whistle
from
his
pocket
the
hawk
took
out
his
diminutive
flashlight
thin
as
a
pencil
it
might
have
been
the
winking
of
a
firefly
as
he
played
it
on
the
dial
of
his
watch
on
the
dot
murmured
the
hawk
some
fast
mail
i
guess
though
she
be
a
little
late
at
that
she
pulls
into
selkirk
a
roar
and
rumble
was
in
the
night
again
increasing
steadily
in
volume
down
the
right
of
way
in
the
distance
a
flash
of
light
stabbed
through
the
black
it
grew
brighter
and
brighter
the
hawk
wary
of
the
spread
of
the
powerful
electric
headlight
edged
further
away
from
the
trackside
and
now
the
rails
gleamed
like
polished
the
stood
up
out
of
the
darkness
a
thing
of
monstrous
size
there
was
the
hiss
of
steam
the
rasp
and
grind
of
the
setting
brakes
the
glinting
rays
from
the
windows
of
a
long
string
of
coaches
that
trailed
back
to
the
station
platform
and
a
big
like
some
human
thirsty
thing
was
panting
beside
the
the
engineer
with
his
torch
swung
from
the
gangway
for
an
oil
around
there
was
the
creak
of
the
descending
spout
the
rush
of
water
and
silhouetted
against
the
the
hawk
could
make
out
the
fireman
standing
on
the
back
of
the
tender
and
now
poking
with
his
oil
can
weirdly
swallowed
up
in
the
darkness
at
intervals
as
he
thrust
the
torch
far
in
under
the
big
machine
the
engineer
moved
slowly
along
the
side
of
the
engine
and
finally
disappeared
around
the
end
of
the
pilot
the
hawk
stole
forward
closer
to
the
track
again
his
eyes
on
the
fireman
who
now
that
the
engineers
torch
was
on
the
other
side
was
more
sharply
outlined
than
before
came
then
the
swish
and
gush
of
water
as
it
overflowed
the
spout
banged
back
against
the
and
the
fireman
scrambled
back
over
the
tender
into
the
cab
it
was
the
moment
the
hawk
had
been
waiting
for
swiftly
but
still
crawling
as
a
safeguard
against
being
seen
by
any
of
the
train
crew
in
the
rear
he
moved
up
the
embankment
and
in
an
instant
had
swung
himself
up
between
the
tender
and
the
forward
door
of
the
express
car
there
was
no
platform
here
of
course
but
the
end
beam
of
the
car
making
a
sort
of
wide
threshold
gave
him
ample
room
on
which
to
stand
the
roar
of
escaping
steam
drowned
out
all
other
sounds
the
back
of
the
tender
hid
him
from
any
chance
of
observation
from
the
cab
he
tried
the
door
cautiously
it
was
locked
of
were
twenty
thousand
dollars
worth
of
stones
in
the
safe
inside
the
hawk
felt
carefully
over
the
lock
with
his
fingers
classifying
it
in
the
darkness
as
it
were
by
the
sense
of
touch
and
produced
from
his
packet
his
bunch
of
skeleton
keys
he
inserted
one
of
the
keys
worked
with
it
for
a
moment
then
shook
his
head
and
selected
another
this
time
he
felt
the
slide
back
the
train
was
jerking
into
motion
now
he
exchanged
his
keys
for
his
automatic
turned
the
knob
softly
opened
the
door
an
inch
and
listened
even
the
wire
devils
were
not
infallible
and
if
by
any
chance
the
the
hawk
whistled
low
and
contentedly
under
his
breath
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
interior
of
the
now
he
slipped
quickly
through
the
door
closing
the
door
behind
him
a
quarter
length
down
the
car
in
the
aisle
made
by
the
express
packages
which
were
piled
high
on
either
side
the
messenger
a
young
man
of
perhaps
was
huddled
apparently
unconscious
in
his
chair
in
a
flash
the
hawk
was
down
the
car
and
bending
sharply
over
the
other
the
man
sat
in
a
helpless
sagging
attitude
he
was
breathing
heavily
and
his
head
hanging
forward
and
a
little
to
one
side
swayed
limply
with
the
motion
of
the
car
there
was
no
question
as
to
the
messenger
was
drugged
and
well
drugged
from
the
man
the
hawk
eyes
travelled
to
a
sort
of
desk
or
ledge
built
out
from
the
side
of
the
car
and
topped
by
a
pigeonholed
rack
stuffed
with
express
forms
and
manila
envelopes
on
the
desk
was
a
small
leather
satchel
containing
some
lunch
and
a
bottle
of
what
was
evidently
cold
tea
now
but
barely
a
quarter
full
and
as
though
to
supply
further
evidence
that
the
man
had
succumbed
in
the
midst
of
his
meal
a
little
to
one
side
lay
a
meat
sandwich
half
eaten
the
hawk
nodded
quietly
to
himself
as
again
his
eyes
time
to
a
small
safe
about
three
feet
square
that
stood
beneath
the
desk
it
was
quite
easy
to
understand
now
the
wire
devils
had
only
to
ascertain
the
fact
that
it
was
the
messenger
habit
to
eat
his
lunch
at
a
certain
time
choose
the
point
of
attack
on
the
line
to
correspond
therewith
and
see
that
a
sufficient
quantity
of
knockout
drops
was
introduced
into
the
cold
a
very
weighty
undertaking
for
the
wire
devils
well
it
was
a
bit
rough
on
the
hawk
was
kneeling
now
in
front
of
the
he
the
hawk
was
greatly
indebted
to
the
wire
devils
twenty
thousand
dollars
was
a
snug
little
a
snug
little
sum
the
figure
in
the
chair
with
swaying
head
breathed
stertorously
there
was
the
pound
quick
in
its
tempo
of
the
trucks
beating
at
the
rail
joints
the
of
the
car
in
protesting
little
creaks
and
over
all
a
muffled
roar
as
the
fast
mail
tore
through
the
the
hawk
heard
none
of
this
his
ear
was
pressed
close
against
the
face
of
the
safe
listening
for
the
tumblers
fall
as
his
fingers
twirled
the
dial
knob
after
a
little
while
the
hawk
spoke
aloud
left
one
quarter
two
right
fourteen
two
left
eighteen
he
said
he
straightened
up
swung
the
handle
of
the
a
dismayed
anxious
look
flashed
across
his
face
there
was
not
much
time
very
little
he
had
missed
it
how
far
along
those
three
miles
from
burke
siding
to
where
the
butcher
was
waiting
had
the
train
already
come
he
tried
again
coolly
again
he
missed
i
guess
i
out
of
practice
to
fall
down
on
a
tin
box
like
this
he
muttered
grimly
but
the
first
two
are
right
the
last
turn
that
wrong
somewhere
give
me
another
minute
or
two
was
twirling
the
dial
knob
with
deft
quick
fingers
once
that
all
i
ask
a
sudden
jolt
flung
him
forward
against
the
safe
came
the
scream
of
the
whistle
the
screech
of
the
brakes
the
bump
and
jerk
and
pound
and
grind
of
the
flying
train
coming
to
an
emergency
stop
the
limp
form
of
the
messenger
sliding
down
was
almost
doubled
over
the
arm
of
the
chair
in
an
instant
the
hawk
had
recovered
his
balance
and
his
face
set
like
iron
his
jaws
clamped
hard
he
snatched
at
the
knob
and
with
desperate
haste
now
made
another
attempt
there
were
a
few
seconds
left
a
few
seconds
before
the
train
would
come
finally
to
a
standstill
they
were
gone
now
those
he
had
missed
again
his
automatic
was
in
his
hand
as
he
stood
up
it
was
no
longer
a
question
of
twenty
thousand
dollars
worth
of
unset
was
a
question
of
his
life
there
was
a
bitter
smile
on
his
lips
as
he
ran
for
the
forward
door
it
looked
as
though
the
pitcher
had
at
last
gone
once
too
often
to
the
well
the
train
had
stopped
now
he
reached
the
door
and
opened
it
guardedly
a
little
way
a
great
red
flare
from
somewhere
ahead
lighted
up
the
night
he
heard
and
recognised
the
butcher
voice
menacing
raucous
punctuated
with
vicious
oaths
get
out
of
that
cab
and
get
out
damned
quick
down
you
now
now
boys
run
back
and
keep
firing
down
the
length
of
the
train
as
you
go
and
if
these
guys
do
run
faster
than
you
do
let
have
it
in
the
back
beat
it
it
like
hell
i
pull
out
the
minute
you
uncoupled
you
two
grab
the
rear
end
as
she
moves
there
room
enough
for
you
and
you
can
bust
in
the
door
a
fusilade
of
shots
rang
out
flashes
cut
the
black
the
butcher
two
companions
evidently
driving
the
engineer
and
fireman
before
them
were
coming
on
the
run
along
the
trackside
from
the
cab
the
hawk
retreated
back
a
step
and
closed
the
car
door
he
heard
the
men
rush
past
outside
the
fusilade
seemed
to
redouble
in
intensity
and
now
added
to
it
were
shouts
and
yells
from
the
rear
of
the
train
itself
he
were
not
shots
his
hand
on
the
doorknob
he
stood
waiting
tensely
with
the
butcher
on
guard
out
there
in
front
it
would
have
been
equivalent
to
suicide
to
have
opened
the
door
again
until
he
knew
the
other
was
back
in
the
the
background
of
the
lighted
interior
he
would
have
made
a
most
excellent
mark
for
the
butcher
his
eyes
swept
past
the
huddled
form
of
the
young
messenger
in
the
chair
and
fixed
speculatively
on
the
safe
he
nodded
suddenly
grimly
twenty
thousand
dollars
well
he
was
beaten
till
he
threw
down
his
own
hand
of
his
own
till
he
lost
sight
of
the
safe
for
keeps
over
the
shouts
and
revolver
shots
came
the
sharp
vicious
hiss
of
the
as
it
was
uncoupled
and
then
with
a
violent
jerk
the
car
started
forward
as
the
butcher
evidently
whipped
the
throttle
open
and
coincidently
there
was
a
smash
upon
the
rear
the
hawk
opened
the
forward
door
and
slipped
out
again
a
din
infernal
was
in
his
ears
like
a
maddened
thing
under
the
butcher
unscientific
spur
the
big
was
coughing
the
sparks
heavenward
in
a
volleying
stream
while
the
huge
drivers
raced
like
pinwheels
in
another
shower
of
sparks
as
the
tires
sought
to
bite
and
hold
and
now
the
rear
door
of
the
car
crashed
inward
the
shots
came
fast
as
a
gatling
and
shouts
screams
and
yells
added
their
quota
to
the
uproar
the
hawk
crouched
by
the
door
moved
suddenly
to
one
side
as
he
caught
the
dull
ominous
spat
of
a
bullet
against
one
of
the
panels
the
train
crew
and
those
of
the
passengers
who
were
armed
were
very
obviously
keeping
up
a
running
fight
from
the
stalled
section
of
the
train
and
pumping
their
through
the
broken
rear
door
and
up
the
aisle
of
the
express
car
as
long
as
they
could
hold
the
range
and
from
within
he
could
distinguish
the
duller
muffled
reports
of
the
confederates
firing
in
return
preventing
any
attempt
being
made
to
rush
the
rear
of
the
car
and
then
the
sounds
began
to
recede
and
die
away
the
men
inside
the
car
ceased
firing
and
he
could
hear
them
now
moving
the
safe
out
from
the
side
of
the
car
it
seemed
as
though
a
very
long
interval
of
time
had
been
consumed
in
the
but
in
reality
he
knew
it
had
been
little
more
than
a
matter
of
time
it
had
taken
the
two
men
to
run
the
length
of
the
car
uncouple
it
and
leap
on
the
rear
end
the
fight
afterwards
could
hardly
count
for
once
the
express
car
began
to
pull
away
the
thing
was
done
they
were
moving
fast
now
and
with
every
instant
the
speed
was
increasing
the
hawk
clutched
at
the
handrail
and
lowered
himself
to
the
iron
which
on
the
express
car
served
in
lieu
of
steps
here
having
chosen
the
opposite
side
to
that
of
the
butcher
at
the
throttle
in
the
cab
he
ran
no
risk
of
being
observed
this
crossing
wherever
it
was
promised
to
concern
him
a
great
deal
more
than
he
had
anticipated
he
leaned
out
and
clung
there
staring
ahead
the
big
was
swaying
and
staggering
like
a
drunken
thing
the
rush
of
the
wind
whipped
at
his
face
a
deafening
roar
sang
in
his
ears
the
fast
mail
usually
ran
fast
but
the
butcher
was
running
like
a
and
the
bark
of
the
exhaust
had
quickened
now
into
a
single
note
deep
as
thunder
with
a
sort
of
grim
placidity
the
hawk
clung
to
the
lurching
rail
far
ahead
along
the
right
of
way
a
shaft
of
light
riven
through
walls
of
blackness
played
the
headlight
shadowy
objects
trees
that
loomed
up
for
an
instant
and
were
gone
showed
on
the
edge
of
the
wavering
ray
they
tore
through
a
rock
cut
and
in
the
confined
space
and
in
the
fraction
of
a
second
it
took
to
traverse
it
the
roar
was
metamorphosed
into
an
explosion
and
then
suddenly
as
though
by
magic
the
headlight
shot
off
at
a
tangent
and
the
glistening
lines
of
steel
that
were
always
converging
but
never
meeting
were
gone
and
the
ray
fell
full
upon
a
densely
wooded
tract
where
leaves
and
foliage
became
a
soft
and
wonderful
shade
of
green
under
the
artificial
light
the
hawk
braced
just
in
time
the
unchecked
swung
the
curve
with
a
mighty
lurch
off
drivers
fairly
lifted
from
the
rails
she
seemed
to
hang
there
hesitantly
for
a
breathless
instant
then
with
a
crunch
staggering
settled
back
and
struck
into
her
stride
again
the
thunder
of
the
exhaust
ceased
abruptly
and
the
speed
began
to
slacken
the
butcher
had
slammed
the
throttle
shut
at
the
end
of
the
headlight
ray
that
was
straight
along
the
track
again
a
red
light
flashed
up
suddenly
three
times
and
vanished
the
hawk
leaned
farther
out
tense
now
straining
his
eyes
ahead
it
was
evidently
number
four
and
number
seven
signalling
from
the
butcher
began
to
check
with
the
and
now
in
the
headlight
glare
the
distance
shortened
the
hawk
could
discern
a
large
wagon
drawn
by
two
horses
that
appeared
to
be
backed
up
close
to
the
side
of
the
track
two
forms
seemed
to
be
tugging
at
the
horses
which
equally
seemed
to
be
plunging
then
being
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
car
the
angle
of
vision
narrowed
and
he
could
see
no
more
the
hawk
turned
eyes
on
the
door
of
the
car
there
was
a
possibility
a
little
more
than
a
possibility
that
the
men
inside
knowing
that
they
had
reached
their
destination
would
come
out
this
way
had
only
to
keep
hidden
from
the
men
out
there
with
the
wagon
until
the
car
men
within
were
sliding
back
the
side
door
he
swung
himself
still
farther
out
on
the
then
curving
back
with
the
aid
of
the
handrail
flattened
himself
against
the
side
of
the
car
they
were
close
up
to
the
wagon
now
and
he
could
hear
voices
cursing
furiously
at
the
horses
as
the
frightened
animals
stamped
and
pawed
and
then
the
car
bumped
and
jerked
to
a
standstill
and
the
butcher
was
bawling
from
the
cab
take
the
horses
out
you
blamed
fools
and
tie
back
there
on
the
road
a
bit
till
we
gone
we
have
a
sweet
time
loading
the
wagon
with
them
doing
the
tango
every
second
take
out
back
the
wagon
up
against
the
the
hawk
lowered
himself
silently
to
the
find
that
the
car
had
come
to
a
stop
directly
over
a
road
crossing
the
men
in
the
car
had
joined
their
voices
with
the
butcher
and
in
the
confusion
now
the
hawk
slipped
quickly
along
the
side
of
the
car
stole
around
the
rear
end
and
from
that
point
of
vantage
stood
watching
the
butcher
and
his
men
at
work
he
could
see
quite
plainly
thanks
to
the
light
from
the
side
door
that
flooded
the
scene
the
horses
had
been
unharnessed
and
were
being
led
away
along
the
road
one
of
the
men
in
the
car
jumped
to
the
ground
as
the
butcher
called
out
and
together
they
backed
the
wagon
close
up
against
the
car
doorway
and
then
presently
the
men
who
had
accompanied
the
horses
one
carrying
a
lantern
came
running
back
the
hawk
eyes
from
a
general
and
comprehensive
survey
of
the
scene
fixed
on
the
man
who
until
now
had
not
left
the
car
but
who
had
now
sprung
down
into
the
wagon
and
was
running
a
short
plank
to
be
used
as
a
skid
evidently
up
to
the
threshold
of
the
car
door
which
was
a
little
above
the
level
of
the
wagon
the
light
shone
full
in
the
man
face
number
kline
confided
the
hawk
softly
to
himself
i
glad
to
know
that
the
last
time
i
chummed
with
crusty
was
back
in
little
old
sing
sing
guess
he
got
out
for
good
he
was
elected
for
five
spaces
yet
crusty
spoke
now
as
he
jumped
back
into
the
car
look
here
butcher
i
telling
you
again
this
guy
in
here
in
pretty
bad
never
mind
about
that
replied
the
butcher
roughly
get
the
safe
out
all
hands
now
we
got
no
time
to
monkey
with
him
come
around
all
right
i
it
none
of
our
lookout
the
men
were
bunched
together
now
three
in
the
doorway
of
the
car
and
two
in
the
wagon
the
safe
between
them
the
hawk
was
studying
one
of
the
two
who
stood
in
the
wagon
one
was
whitie
jim
as
he
already
knew
but
the
other
had
had
his
back
half
turned
and
the
hawk
had
not
been
able
to
see
his
face
the
safe
slid
down
the
plank
and
was
levered
and
pushed
forward
into
the
middle
of
the
wagon
french
pete
said
the
hawk
suddenly
and
as
softly
as
before
as
the
man
he
had
been
watching
straightened
up
and
turned
around
say
i
guess
sing
sing
gone
out
of
else
somebody
left
the
door
open
but
if
the
hawk
words
were
indicative
of
a
facetious
mood
his
actions
were
not
there
was
a
sort
of
dawning
inspiration
in
the
dark
narrowed
eyes
and
the
strong
jaw
as
it
was
outthrust
drew
his
lips
into
a
grim
hard
smile
they
were
spreading
a
huge
tarpaulin
over
the
wagon
and
abruptly
the
hawk
drew
back
dropped
to
his
hands
and
knees
crawled
along
the
trackside
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
car
again
until
almost
opposite
the
wagon
and
there
lay
flat
and
motionless
at
the
side
of
the
road
there
was
a
chance
yet
still
a
chance
a
very
good
that
twenty
thousand
dollars
worth
of
unset
stones
all
right
now
it
was
the
butcher
voice
pull
her
away
a
few
feet
into
the
clear
the
wagon
creaked
and
rattled
enough
now
get
a
move
steps
crunched
along
the
butcher
and
his
two
companions
obviously
making
for
the
a
moment
later
came
the
cough
of
the
engine
exhaust
and
the
express
car
began
to
glide
past
the
spot
where
the
hawk
lay
the
hawk
raised
himself
cautiously
on
his
elbows
two
dark
forms
and
a
bobbing
lantern
were
already
speeding
toward
where
the
horses
had
been
left
the
hawk
crawled
forward
crossed
the
paused
the
engine
and
express
car
were
fast
disappearing
in
the
distance
the
lantern
glimmered
amongst
the
trees
at
the
side
of
the
road
a
good
hundred
yards
away
there
was
no
shadow
to
fall
across
the
back
of
the
wagon
i
said
it
was
a
nice
night
and
that
it
was
strange
how
some
people
preferred
a
moon
observed
the
hawk
lifting
the
end
of
the
tarpaulin
he
swung
noiselessly
under
it
into
the
wagon
and
stretched
himself
out
beside
the
safe
third
party
the
hawk
felt
upward
with
his
hand
over
the
safe
it
was
faced
he
found
toward
the
rear
of
the
wagon
this
necessitated
a
change
in
his
own
position
he
listened
tensely
they
were
coming
back
with
the
horses
now
but
they
were
still
quite
a
little
way
off
he
shifted
quickly
around
until
his
head
and
shoulders
were
in
front
of
the
safe
it
was
the
last
turn
of
the
combination
that
i
fell
down
on
though
i
do
see
how
it
happened
muttered
the
hawk
he
felt
above
his
head
again
this
time
rubbing
his
fingers
critically
over
the
then
the
diminutive
little
flashlight
winked
winked
again
as
it
played
around
him
and
finally
held
steadily
on
the
nickel
dial
there
were
no
inadvertent
openings
and
particularly
no
holes
in
the
tarpaulin
and
the
texture
of
the
tarpaulin
was
a
guarantee
that
the
tiny
rays
of
light
would
not
show
through
they
were
harnessing
the
horses
into
the
wagon
now
the
hawk
in
a
somewhat
cramped
position
due
to
the
wagon
narrow
width
his
legs
twisted
at
right
angles
to
his
body
as
he
lay
on
his
back
reached
up
and
began
to
twirl
the
dial
knob
slowly
and
with
painstaking
care
left
one
quarter
murmured
the
hawk
and
a
moment
later
two
right
the
hawk
swore
earnestly
under
his
breath
the
jolt
of
the
wagon
coming
unexpectedly
as
it
started
forward
had
caused
him
to
spin
the
knob
too
far
around
it
was
hot
stifling
hot
under
the
heavy
tarpaulin
that
slanting
downward
from
the
little
safe
lay
almost
against
his
face
a
bead
of
sweat
had
gathered
on
his
forehead
he
brushed
it
away
and
began
again
to
work
at
the
dial
it
was
more
difficult
wagon
bumped
infernally
and
as
he
worked
he
could
hear
the
muffled
clatter
of
the
horses
hoofs
and
occasionally
the
voices
of
the
two
men
on
the
seat
and
then
suddenly
the
hawk
fingers
travelled
from
the
dial
knob
to
the
handle
had
he
got
it
this
time
the
handle
swung
was
a
low
metallic
bolt
had
slipped
back
to
the
end
of
its
grooves
the
safe
was
unlocked
twenty
thousand
dollars
said
the
hawk
very
without
the
slightest
sound
he
edged
his
body
backwards
to
afford
space
for
the
swing
of
the
opening
door
twenty
thousand
the
word
died
half
uttered
on
the
hawk
lips
the
flashlight
was
illuminating
the
interior
of
the
safe
on
the
bottom
lay
a
single
crisp
counterfeit
note
over
the
face
of
which
was
scrawled
in
with
the
hawk
compliments
otherwise
the
safe
was
empty
for
a
moment
like
a
man
dazed
he
stared
at
the
counterfeit
note
he
could
not
seem
to
believe
his
eyes
safe
was
empty
the
diamonds
were
these
poor
fools
were
driving
an
empty
safe
to
the
master
another
poor
fool
with
dropped
jaw
was
staring
gaping
like
an
imbecile
into
one
and
then
a
grip
upon
himself
again
he
laughed
low
grimly
unpleasantly
with
the
hawk
compliments
he
had
sent
a
bill
like
that
once
to
macvightie
with
the
hawk
compliments
this
was
very
neat
very
clever
of
must
have
known
what
the
wire
devils
were
up
to
there
would
be
no
doubt
in
the
minds
of
the
wire
devils
who
would
have
heard
of
that
little
episode
with
macvightie
but
that
the
hawk
had
again
forestalled
them
and
left
them
a
counterfeit
bill
in
exchange
thousand
dollars
worth
of
unset
diamonds
only
it
was
this
somebody
and
not
he
the
hawk
who
was
twenty
thousand
dollars
the
richer
for
it
he
reached
in
picked
up
the
bill
to
put
it
in
his
suddenly
laid
it
back
again
and
closed
and
locked
the
safe
why
deprive
the
master
spider
of
a
little
joy
and
besides
it
would
carry
a
message
not
perhaps
so
erroneous
after
in
a
flash
logically
indisputably
apparently
impossible
though
it
appeared
to
be
on
the
surface
he
knew
who
that
somebody
was
the
shelving
of
the
theft
to
the
hawk
shoulders
would
have
defeated
its
own
object
unless
the
theft
were
committed
and
discovered
on
this
particular
division
of
the
railroad
where
the
hawk
and
incidentally
his
supposed
gang
of
desperadoes
were
known
to
be
operating
the
messenger
certainly
had
not
been
in
a
drugged
condition
when
he
went
on
duty
and
since
it
was
only
reasonable
to
assume
that
he
would
have
satisfied
himself
everything
was
all
right
at
that
time
it
was
evident
as
he
had
given
no
alarm
that
the
contents
of
the
safe
had
been
intact
when
he
took
as
a
through
man
in
new
york
or
at
the
eastern
terminus
of
the
road
or
at
the
last
divisional
did
not
matter
which
the
robbery
then
had
been
committed
while
the
messenger
was
present
in
the
it
had
been
committed
on
this
division
the
safe
had
not
been
forced
it
showed
not
the
slightest
sign
of
had
been
opened
on
the
combination
some
one
then
an
expert
in
the
first
stages
of
the
messenger
drugged
condition
had
happened
into
the
car
just
ahead
of
him
the
hawk
and
had
done
exactly
what
he
the
hawk
had
intended
to
do
no
said
the
hawk
no
i
guess
he
was
wriggling
noiselessly
backward
and
his
feet
were
hanging
out
now
over
the
end
of
the
wagon
like
that
do
very
often
the
hawk
head
and
shoulders
were
still
under
the
tarpaulin
but
his
feet
now
could
just
feel
the
ground
beneath
them
i
guess
said
the
hawk
as
he
suddenly
withdrew
his
head
and
crouching
low
ran
a
few
steps
with
the
wagon
then
dropped
full
length
in
the
road
i
guess
third
the
wagon
disappeared
in
the
darkness
the
hawk
rose
and
turning
broke
into
a
run
back
along
the
road
he
had
been
longer
in
the
wagon
than
he
had
took
him
ten
minutes
to
regain
the
railroad
tracks
here
without
pause
still
running
he
kept
on
along
the
right
of
there
was
a
hard
twist
to
his
lips
and
the
clenching
of
his
fists
was
not
wholly
due
to
runner
how
far
had
the
butcher
taken
the
car
before
deserting
it
a
mile
two
he
could
not
run
three
miles
under
half
an
hour
and
that
would
be
fast
over
railroad
ties
how
long
would
it
be
before
the
train
crew
of
the
stalled
mail
got
back
to
burke
siding
and
managed
somehow
in
spite
of
the
cut
wires
to
give
the
how
long
before
the
dispatcher
at
selkirk
with
the
fast
mail
reported
out
at
burke
siding
and
no
o
from
bradley
would
smell
a
rat
it
would
take
time
after
that
of
course
before
anything
could
be
done
but
at
best
the
margin
left
for
him
was
desperately
narrow
he
ran
on
and
on
his
eyes
grown
accustomed
to
the
darkness
enabling
him
to
pick
out
the
ties
with
a
fair
degree
of
accuracy
there
was
not
a
sound
save
that
of
his
own
footsteps
he
stopped
for
breath
again
and
again
and
again
and
again
ran
on
at
top
speed
it
seemed
as
though
he
had
run
not
three
miles
but
six
when
finally
far
ahead
he
caught
a
glow
of
light
the
butcher
and
his
confederates
had
evidently
not
taken
the
trouble
to
close
the
side
door
of
the
car
instinctively
the
hawk
in
caution
slowed
his
the
next
instant
smiling
pityingly
at
himself
for
the
act
ran
on
the
faster
the
butcher
and
the
other
two
would
long
since
have
made
their
getaway
there
was
only
the
the
messenger
was
drugged
that
was
all
that
need
concern
him
find
some
way
to
rouse
the
man
so
that
he
could
talk
the
hawk
reached
the
car
ran
along
the
side
to
the
open
stood
suddenly
still
and
then
with
a
low
startled
cry
he
swung
himself
up
and
through
the
doorway
and
running
forward
knelt
beside
a
huddled
form
on
the
floor
it
was
the
messenger
sprawled
on
his
face
now
motionless
and
it
was
no
longer
a
case
of
being
man
had
been
shot
there
was
a
dark
ugly
pool
on
the
flooring
and
a
thin
red
stream
had
trickled
away
in
a
zigzag
course
along
one
of
the
planks
the
hawk
lips
were
tight
the
butcher
work
but
why
why
yes
yes
he
understood
the
butcher
too
in
some
way
had
discovered
that
the
messenger
third
party
the
was
even
more
of
a
boy
now
in
appearance
it
seemed
to
the
hawk
with
his
ashen
face
and
colourless
boy
moaned
a
little
and
as
the
hawk
lifted
him
up
opened
his
eyes
the
hawk
produced
a
flask
and
forced
a
few
drops
between
the
lips
listen
he
said
distinctly
try
and
understand
what
i
am
saying
did
they
get
the
diamonds
from
you
after
they
shot
you
the
boy
eyes
widened
with
a
quick
sudden
fear
perhaps
the
drug
had
begun
to
wear
it
was
the
wound
and
the
loss
of
blood
that
had
cleared
his
brain
the
diamonds
he
faltered
yes
said
the
hawk
grimly
the
diamonds
you
took
them
did
you
tell
those
men
where
they
were
a
lie
the
boy
seemed
to
shiver
convulsively
then
his
voice
scarcely
audible
no
true
did
guess
i
going
i
true
but
did
tell
there
were
any
he
had
fainted
in
the
hawk
arms
my
god
whispered
the
hawk
solemnly
it
he
held
the
flask
to
the
other
lips
again
it
was
the
butcher
then
who
had
shot
the
boy
and
besides
he
saw
now
that
the
wound
was
in
a
strangely
curious
the
back
below
the
shoulder
blade
the
boy
had
been
sitting
in
his
shirt
sleeves
and
the
back
of
his
vest
was
soaked
with
blood
and
the
hawk
remembered
the
fusillade
of
bullets
that
had
swept
up
the
interior
of
the
car
and
the
spat
upon
the
forward
door
panel
as
he
had
crouched
there
he
understood
the
boy
sitting
in
a
stupor
in
his
chair
facing
the
forward
door
had
been
directly
in
the
line
of
fire
and
a
stray
bullet
had
found
its
mark
do
know
how
you
knew
boy
had
roused
and
was
speaking
i
going
true
two
days
ago
a
man
gave
me
a
hundred
dollars
to
stand
knockout
drops
on
the
run
could
get
was
happened
i
be
found
no
blame
coming
to
he
motioned
weakly
toward
the
flask
in
the
hawk
hand
give
me
some
more
of
that
he
did
not
speak
for
a
moment
and
instead
prompted
the
hawk
quietly
you
the
had
a
counterfeit
bill
the
boy
went
on
with
an
effort
i
heard
about
the
macvightie
i
knew
from
what
fellow
the
one
of
them
got
to
thinking
all
i
had
to
do
was
empty
the
write
just
what
the
hawk
did
on
the
shove
it
in
the
take
the
then
drink
the
tea
that
had
the
drops
in
it
would
be
drugged
and
think
the
hawk
did
it
while
i
was
drugged
before
got
that
what
i
the
boy
was
silent
again
it
was
still
outside
very
the
chirpings
of
the
insects
and
the
the
hawk
had
listened
to
while
he
had
lain
below
the
embankment
waiting
for
the
train
at
burke
siding
there
was
a
set
strained
look
on
the
hawk
face
the
kid
was
paying
the
long
twenty
thousand
dollars
worth
of
unset
diamonds
to
make
it
look
the
real
thing
boy
lips
were
moving
cleaned
out
everything
in
the
of
course
there
must
any
of
that
be
i
tied
the
stuff
weighted
it
and
dropped
as
we
came
over
the
bridge
at
moosehead
and
then
i
had
hide
the
diamonds
so
they
would
be
found
on
me
and
yet
come
along
with
not
be
left
in
the
car
i
was
afraid
that
when
some
of
the
train
crew
found
me
undress
put
me
to
so
i
did
dare
hide
the
diamonds
in
my
clothes
he
raised
himself
up
suddenly
clutched
frantically
at
the
hawk
shoulders
and
his
voice
rang
wildly
through
the
car
hold
me
me
let
me
go
out
got
something
more
to
say
do
tell
her
tell
her
i
tell
you
where
the
stones
are
they
in
the
lining
of
my
lunch
for
god
sake
do
tell
let
her
know
i
you
do
have
to
do
you
say
you
do
going
got
what
coming
to
me
and
her
knowing
too
would
kill
her
she
was
a
good
you
hear
he
was
stiffening
back
in
the
hawk
arms
and
this
ai
coming
to
her
she
was
a
good
you
called
her
mother
but
she
my
mother
the
boy
never
spoke
again
the
hawk
laid
the
still
form
gently
back
on
the
floor
of
the
car
and
stood
up
and
there
was
a
mist
in
the
hawk
eyes
that
blotted
out
his
immediate
surroundings
and
in
the
mist
he
seemed
to
see
another
scene
and
it
was
the
picture
of
a
gentle
old
woman
who
had
silver
hair
and
who
wore
clothes
that
were
a
little
threadbare
and
whose
grey
irish
eyes
behind
the
spectacles
were
filled
with
tears
and
he
seemed
to
see
the
thin
shoulders
square
proudly
back
and
he
seemed
to
hear
her
speak
again
i
love
my
boy
i
love
him
with
all
my
heart
but
i
should
a
thousand
times
rather
see
him
dead
than
know
him
for
a
mechanically
the
hawk
moved
over
to
the
desk
where
the
lunch
satchel
still
lay
and
emptied
out
the
remainder
of
the
food
no
said
the
hawk
i
guess
she
never
know
and
i
guess
i
have
to
take
the
stuff
now
anyway
whether
i
wanted
to
or
she
not
to
he
was
examining
the
inside
of
the
satchel
it
was
an
old
and
affair
and
a
torn
piece
of
the
lining
stuck
down
with
paste
at
the
edges
would
ordinarily
have
attracted
no
attention
the
hawk
loosened
this
and
felt
inside
at
the
bottom
carefully
packed
away
were
strips
of
cotton
wadding
he
took
one
out
embedded
in
this
were
a
number
of
diamonds
which
as
he
drew
the
wadding
apart
flashed
brilliantly
in
the
light
of
the
oil
lamps
above
his
head
he
wrapped
the
stones
up
again
and
put
them
in
his
out
the
remainder
from
the
satchel
put
these
also
in
his
pocket
and
replaced
in
the
satchel
the
portion
of
the
lunch
he
had
removed
it
mattered
little
about
the
torn
lining
now
he
kind
of
put
it
up
to
me
said
the
hawk
slowly
yes
and
she
did
knowing
mother
barrett
it
kind
of
queer
she
should
have
said
of
the
hawk
pulled
the
drawer
of
the
desk
open
and
nodded
as
he
found
and
took
out
the
revolver
thought
he
have
one
and
that
it
would
most
likely
be
here
he
muttered
he
crossed
the
car
and
listened
intently
at
the
open
side
door
there
was
no
for
instance
coming
from
bradley
yet
he
closed
the
door
and
stood
for
an
instant
looking
down
at
the
boy
form
on
the
floor
i
guess
i
can
fix
it
for
you
he
said
simply
i
guess
i
in
rapid
succession
he
fired
five
of
the
seven
shots
from
the
revolver
then
stooping
laid
the
weapon
as
though
it
had
dropped
at
last
from
nerveless
fingers
just
beside
the
boy
outstretched
hand
he
straightened
up
stepped
to
the
side
door
and
slid
it
open
again
it
let
the
smoke
out
before
anybody
gets
here
said
the
hawk
the
butcher
is
coming
forward
with
any
testimony
and
with
all
those
shots
fired
at
the
time
of
the
who
to
know
the
boy
did
fight
till
he
went
down
and
out
and
now
i
guess
i
make
my
own
getaway
he
dropped
to
the
trackside
and
started
forward
at
a
brisk
pace
i
keep
on
a
bit
until
i
hear
something
coming
he
decided
then
i
lay
low
while
they
cleaning
up
the
line
and
wait
till
i
can
hop
a
freight
east
or
west
that
will
get
me
out
of
this
particular
locality
after
that
there
nothing
to
it
a
hundred
yards
farther
on
the
hawk
spoke
again
and
there
was
a
twisted
smile
on
the
hawk
lips
it
break
her
heart
anyway
i
guess
he
said
but
help
some
maybe
to
be
proud
of
him
yes
i
guess
they
tell
her
that
all
he
died
a
game
lead
capsule
the
hawk
yawned
he
had
been
almost
hours
without
sleep
he
had
slept
all
day
after
he
had
regained
his
room
following
the
night
at
crossing
but
after
he
frowned
in
a
perturbed
and
puzzled
way
ensconced
now
in
a
wicker
lounging
chair
in
the
observation
car
of
the
coast
limited
he
was
apparently
engrossed
in
the
financial
page
of
his
newspaper
and
apparently
quite
oblivious
of
his
fellow
travellers
some
four
or
five
of
whom
lounged
and
smoked
in
their
own
respective
wicker
chairs
around
him
on
a
little
pad
of
paper
which
he
held
in
his
left
hand
he
might
even
without
serious
tax
upon
the
imagination
have
appeared
to
be
calculating
the
effect
of
the
market
fluctuations
upon
personal
and
perhaps
narrowly
held
again
he
scowled
unhappily
the
hawk
however
at
the
moment
was
engrossed
solely
with
a
few
curiously
assorted
letters
of
the
alphabet
which
were
scrawled
across
the
top
of
the
pad
they
ran
pzudl
kmlqpb
beneath
this
his
pencil
had
already
been
at
work
and
he
had
transformed
the
line
as
follows
he
was
staring
at
this
result
now
in
a
bewildered
way
then
his
pencil
picked
out
the
remaining
five
unscored
letters
and
mechanically
set
them
down
as
a
third
line
rainy
was
one
word
just
one
what
did
it
mean
what
was
the
significance
of
the
word
no
message
in
the
wire
devils
cipher
once
the
message
was
decoded
but
had
been
at
once
clear
and
unmistakable
in
its
meaning
before
had
they
resorted
now
to
code
words
as
well
to
a
cipher
within
a
cipher
into
the
grimness
of
the
hawk
smile
there
crept
a
hint
of
weariness
as
he
slipped
the
pad
into
his
pocket
allowed
the
newspaper
to
drop
to
his
knees
and
edging
his
chair
around
gazed
out
of
the
window
for
once
his
knowledge
of
their
cipher
was
obviously
useless
to
useless
when
a
foreknowledge
of
their
plans
at
that
moment
meant
scarcely
less
than
a
matter
of
life
and
death
to
him
in
a
very
unpleasantly
real
and
literal
sense
not
a
word
had
come
from
them
not
a
message
had
gone
over
the
wires
on
either
of
the
two
preceding
nights
not
a
sign
of
existence
had
they
given
since
three
nights
ago
when
with
an
empty
safe
as
the
sole
reward
for
their
elaborately
laid
plans
he
the
hawk
had
enriched
himself
with
the
twenty
thousand
dollars
worth
of
diamonds
it
had
once
contained
there
had
been
something
sinister
something
ominous
in
their
silence
as
compared
with
the
almost
insane
ravings
of
macvightie
the
police
and
the
and
the
railroad
men
as
well
who
were
particularly
incensed
over
the
murder
of
the
young
messenger
found
dead
at
his
post
in
the
express
car
with
his
revolver
partially
emptied
on
the
floor
beside
him
the
hawk
drummed
abstractedly
with
his
finger
tips
upon
the
window
pane
macvightie
the
police
and
the
press
made
no
doubt
but
that
he
the
hawk
was
the
leader
of
the
desperadoes
who
were
terrorising
that
particular
section
of
the
country
on
the
other
hand
the
gang
itself
had
already
had
occasions
enough
and
in
plenty
to
be
painfully
aware
that
he
the
hawk
played
always
a
lone
won
a
smile
grim
and
ironical
parted
the
firm
set
lips
the
police
and
the
wire
devils
had
a
common
hawk
he
was
the
storm
centre
the
smile
faded
the
strong
jaws
clamped
and
the
dark
eyes
narrowed
on
the
flying
landscape
it
was
not
the
police
who
concerned
him
it
was
not
the
impotent
frothings
of
the
was
the
silence
that
the
wire
devils
had
not
broken
since
that
night
until
they
had
broken
it
this
morning
with
the
single
word
that
now
that
he
had
deciphered
it
still
meant
nothing
to
him
a
dozen
times
stealing
their
cipher
messages
he
had
turned
all
their
carefully
prepared
plans
to
his
own
account
and
snatched
away
the
prize
even
as
they
were
in
the
act
of
reaching
for
it
but
he
was
not
a
fool
to
close
his
eyes
to
the
inevitable
result
he
was
pitted
against
the
cleverest
brains
in
the
criminal
world
all
the
cunning
that
they
knew
would
be
ruthlessly
turned
against
him
and
already
out
to
get
him
a
price
already
guaranteed
to
the
lucky
member
of
the
band
out
of
the
common
funds
the
empty
safe
of
three
nights
before
with
its
jeering
counterfeit
bill
flung
in
their
faces
crowned
he
feared
their
injuries
at
his
hands
and
marked
the
turning
point
where
they
would
leave
no
stone
unturned
to
wreak
their
vengeance
upon
him
and
he
did
not
like
this
silence
of
theirs
since
that
night
were
they
suspicious
at
last
that
he
had
the
key
to
their
cipher
he
did
not
think
so
and
yet
he
did
not
was
always
a
possibility
but
in
any
case
wary
of
any
move
they
might
make
he
had
as
far
as
it
was
humanly
possible
remained
within
sound
of
a
telegraph
instrument
ever
since
last
night
for
example
taking
advantage
of
some
repairs
that
were
being
made
on
the
station
at
elk
head
fifty
miles
east
of
selkirk
he
had
lain
hidden
behind
a
mass
of
building
material
in
the
dismantled
waiting
room
within
earshot
of
the
telegraph
there
had
been
nothing
forced
to
retire
from
there
by
the
advent
of
the
workmen
he
had
eaten
a
very
leisurely
breakfast
at
the
lunch
within
earshot
of
the
sounder
he
had
lingered
around
the
station
as
long
as
he
had
dared
without
running
the
risk
of
exciting
suspicion
and
then
he
had
taken
the
local
east
for
bald
taken
the
chance
because
he
had
no
choice
that
nothing
would
break
over
the
wires
during
the
of
an
hour
that
he
was
on
the
train
the
limited
scheduled
bald
creek
and
that
would
give
him
an
excuse
for
remaining
there
an
innocent
and
prospective
patron
of
the
road
until
the
limited
arrival
some
two
hours
later
after
that
if
nothing
happened
he
had
intended
to
go
back
on
the
limited
to
get
some
sleep
the
hawk
yawned
heavily
again
yes
after
an
almost
uninterrupted
vigil
of
hours
one
needed
sleep
well
he
was
on
his
way
back
to
selkirk
the
limited
only
something
had
happened
almost
at
the
moment
that
the
limited
had
pulled
into
bald
creek
the
wire
devils
had
broken
their
silence
and
a
cipher
message
had
flashed
over
the
wires
he
had
waited
for
it
fought
for
it
schemed
for
it
gone
without
sleep
for
two
days
and
nights
for
he
had
been
rewarded
he
had
intercepted
the
message
deciphered
it
he
had
got
it
at
had
it
now
it
was
the
one
and
the
word
to
him
the
hawk
fingers
ceased
their
drumming
on
the
window
pane
his
head
inclined
slightly
to
one
side
and
he
listened
his
fellow
travellers
had
evidently
scraped
up
acquaintanceship
the
conversation
had
become
suddenly
interesting
yes
unquestionably
the
amount
i
have
with
me
is
worth
quite
easily
a
half
million
hundred
thousand
dollars
it
is
not
my
personal
property
i
regret
to
say
quantities
sufficient
to
be
of
material
service
are
for
the
most
part
institutionally
the
hawk
swung
around
in
his
chair
and
with
frank
interest
surveyed
the
little
group
he
had
scanned
them
once
already
critically
the
moment
he
had
first
entered
the
car
the
man
who
sat
nearest
to
him
was
a
doctor
from
selkirk
and
it
being
the
ingrained
policy
of
the
hawk
to
know
a
reporter
as
he
would
know
a
man
he
had
recognised
one
of
the
others
as
a
young
reporter
on
the
staff
of
the
selkirk
evening
journal
the
others
again
of
whom
there
were
three
were
strangers
to
him
his
eyes
frank
the
man
who
had
just
spoken
there
had
been
just
a
trace
of
accent
in
the
other
perfect
english
and
it
bore
out
the
man
appearance
the
man
was
perhaps
years
of
age
rather
swarthy
in
complexion
and
though
slight
in
build
commanding
in
presence
the
black
vandyke
beard
as
well
as
the
mustache
was
carefully
trimmed
and
his
face
had
an
air
of
the
student
about
it
an
air
that
was
enhanced
by
the
extraordinarily
spectacles
which
he
wore
the
excellent
clothes
were
unmistakably
of
foreign
cut
great
scott
ejaculated
the
reporter
is
that
straight
he
twisted
his
cigar
excitedly
from
one
corner
of
his
mouth
to
the
other
i
say
i
do
suppose
there
a
chance
of
getting
a
squint
at
it
eh
the
foreigner
face
was
politely
puzzled
i
mean
a
chance
to
see
see
what
it
looks
like
interpreted
the
reporter
with
a
laugh
oh
yes
of
squint
i
will
remember
that
the
foreigner
joined
in
the
laugh
one
learns
monsieur
always
one
keeps
one
ears
open
he
reached
down
and
picked
up
a
small
black
bag
from
the
floor
beside
his
chair
no
i
am
afraid
i
can
not
actually
show
it
to
you
monsieur
owing
to
the
nature
of
the
container
but
perhaps
even
the
manner
in
which
it
is
carried
may
be
of
interest
and
if
so
i
shall
be
the
others
the
hawk
among
them
leaned
spontaneously
forward
in
their
chairs
from
the
bag
the
man
produced
a
lead
box
some
four
inches
square
he
opened
this
and
from
where
it
was
nested
in
wadding
took
out
what
looked
like
a
piece
of
lead
of
the
thickness
and
length
of
one
little
finger
he
held
it
out
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
for
their
inspection
inside
this
sealed
lead
covering
he
explained
is
a
glass
tube
hermetically
sealed
the
lead
of
course
absorbs
the
rays
which
otherwise
would
render
the
radium
extremely
dangerous
to
handle
you
perhaps
remember
the
not
it
may
possibly
be
of
interest
radium
you
know
was
discovered
in
by
monsieur
and
madame
curie
but
the
action
of
radium
on
human
tissues
was
unknown
until
when
professor
becquerel
of
paris
having
incautiously
carried
a
tube
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
there
appeared
on
the
skin
within
two
weeks
the
severe
inflammation
which
has
become
known
as
the
famous
burn
since
that
time
i
may
add
active
investigation
into
the
action
of
radium
has
been
carried
on
resulting
in
the
establishment
in
paris
in
of
the
laboratoire
biologique
du
the
doctor
from
selkirk
reached
out
and
obtaining
a
smiling
permission
picked
up
the
lead
cylinder
from
the
other
hand
the
reporter
sucked
noisily
on
the
butt
of
his
cigar
and
d
mean
to
say
that
worth
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
he
demanded
helplessly
fully
replied
the
foreigner
gravely
i
should
consider
myself
very
fortunate
if
i
had
the
means
and
the
opportunity
of
purchasing
it
at
that
price
there
are
only
a
few
grains
there
it
is
true
and
yet
even
that
is
a
very
appreciable
percentage
of
the
world
entire
output
for
a
single
year
the
austrian
government
when
it
bought
the
pitchblende
mines
at
joachimsthal
you
know
acquired
what
is
practically
a
world
monopoly
of
radium
and
since
the
annual
production
of
ore
from
those
mines
is
but
about
thousand
pounds
and
that
from
those
thousand
pounds
only
something
like
grains
of
radium
are
obtained
it
is
not
difficult
to
understand
the
enormous
price
which
it
the
little
lead
cylinder
passed
from
hand
to
hand
it
came
last
to
the
hawk
he
examined
it
with
no
more
and
no
less
interest
than
had
been
displayed
by
the
others
and
returned
it
to
its
owner
who
replaced
it
in
the
black
handbag
look
here
said
the
reporter
impulsively
i
do
want
to
nose
into
personal
affairs
but
if
it
a
fair
question
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
the
stuff
it
was
the
doctor
from
selkirk
who
spoke
before
the
foreigner
had
time
to
reply
i
was
being
tempted
to
ask
the
same
question
myself
he
said
quickly
i
am
a
moreling
is
my
from
what
you
have
said
i
imagine
that
possibly
you
are
a
medical
man
yourself
and
you
are
quite
right
the
other
answered
cordially
i
am
doctor
meunier
and
i
come
from
what
exclaimed
the
selkirk
physician
excitedly
not
doctor
meunier
the
famous
cancer
specialist
and
surgeon
of
the
salpêtrière
hospital
the
other
shrugged
his
shoulders
protestingly
well
he
smiled
a
little
embarrassed
my
name
is
certainly
meunier
and
it
is
true
that
i
have
the
honour
to
be
connected
with
the
institution
you
have
the
reporter
had
a
notebook
in
his
hand
gee
he
observed
softly
you
do
mind
do
you
doctor
meunier
this
looks
like
luck
to
me
i
on
the
evening
reporter
the
dark
eyes
seemed
to
twinkle
humorously
from
behind
the
heavy
lenses
i
have
met
i
landed
in
new
york
they
were
very
nice
i
liked
them
very
much
certainly
young
man
why
should
you
not
say
anything
i
have
told
you
you
have
my
fine
cried
the
reporter
enthusiastically
and
now
doctor
meunier
if
you
just
round
out
the
story
by
telling
us
why
the
celebrated
paris
surgeon
is
travelling
in
america
with
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
worth
of
radium
i
be
glad
i
got
panned
on
the
story
i
went
after
this
morning
and
so
had
to
take
this
train
panned
inquired
the
other
gravely
the
reporter
nodded
it
blew
up
you
blew
up
ah
the
foreigner
face
was
at
once
concerned
so
you
were
in
an
accident
then
no
no
laughed
the
reporter
there
was
anything
in
the
story
it
did
have
any
again
i
learn
observed
the
foreigner
with
an
amused
drawl
he
studied
the
reporter
for
an
instant
quizzically
and
so
i
am
to
supply
the
place
of
the
panned
story
that
blew
that
it
well
very
well
why
not
i
see
no
reason
against
it
if
it
will
be
of
service
to
you
very
well
then
i
have
been
summoned
to
japan
to
attend
a
case
of
i
am
on
my
way
there
he
smiled
again
i
have
noticed
that
american
reporters
are
observant
and
it
may
occur
to
you
that
i
might
have
reached
my
destination
quicker
by
way
of
russia
as
a
matter
of
fact
however
i
was
in
new
york
attending
a
convention
when
i
received
the
summons
i
cabled
for
the
radium
young
man
that
pretty
well
completes
the
said
the
reporter
he
wrote
rapidly
operation
on
a
japanese
why
yes
of
a
you
said
that
listens
as
though
it
might
be
for
one
of
the
emperor
family
prodded
the
reporter
shrewdly
i
did
not
say
so
smiled
the
other
imperturbably
and
even
if
it
were
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
significantly
i
get
you
grinned
the
reporter
well
there
no
harm
in
saying
a
personage
then
is
there
that
sounds
good
and
it
would
have
to
be
some
one
on
the
top
of
the
heap
to
bring
a
man
like
you
all
this
let
us
be
discreet
young
man
and
let
us
say
a
member
of
prominent
family
suggested
the
other
still
smiling
all
right
agreed
the
reporter
i
wo
put
anything
over
on
you
i
promise
you
and
now
doctor
tell
us
something
more
about
radium
how
it
acts
and
all
that
and
how
an
operation
is
performed
with
it
the
hawk
had
apparently
lost
interest
he
settled
back
in
his
chair
and
picked
up
his
previously
discarded
occasionally
his
eyes
strayed
over
the
top
of
his
newspaper
and
rested
meditatively
on
the
little
black
handbag
on
the
car
floor
beside
the
frenchman
chair
the
doctor
from
selkirk
the
reporter
and
the
french
specialist
talked
on
the
limited
reached
the
last
stop
before
selkirk
as
the
train
pulled
out
again
the
hawk
as
it
were
summed
up
his
thoughts
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
confided
the
hawk
softly
to
himself
maybe
it
would
be
easy
to
sell
but
it
would
make
a
very
nice
very
nice
haul
it
would
anybody
yes
bad
stuff
to
handle
the
fences
would
be
leery
probably
because
i
guess
every
last
grain
on
this
little
old
globe
is
catalogued
as
to
ownership
and
they
be
afraid
it
would
be
an
game
that
what
they
were
trying
to
shove
would
be
spotted
as
the
stolen
that
it
could
be
done
though
at
that
there
always
somebody
to
take
a
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
and
what
about
the
institution
that
owns
it
coming
across
big
and
no
questions
asked
to
get
it
back
again
yes
i
guess
it
would
make
a
nice
very
nice
haul
i
the
conductor
had
entered
the
car
had
said
something
that
the
hawk
had
not
now
the
french
specialist
was
on
his
feet
how
long
did
you
say
he
demanded
excitedly
i
did
say
replied
the
conductor
i
only
hours
anyway
and
if
we
through
under
it
be
because
some
one
has
performed
a
twelve
echoed
the
frenchman
wildly
but
mon
dieu
i
have
not
that
to
spare
to
catch
my
steamer
for
japan
in
san
francisco
but
what
wrong
conductor
asked
the
selkirk
doctor
you
have
told
us
the
rainy
river
bridge
is
out
the
conductor
answered
the
rainy
river
bridge
the
hawk
reached
into
his
pocket
withdrew
his
cigarette
case
and
made
a
critical
choice
of
one
of
the
six
identical
cigarettes
the
case
contained
out
how
the
doctor
from
selkirk
persisted
no
details
said
the
conductor
except
that
it
was
blown
up
a
little
while
ago
and
that
they
think
it
the
work
of
the
gang
they
just
got
word
over
the
wire
at
the
last
jumping
whiskers
yelled
the
reporter
is
that
right
conductor
yes
i
guess
it
right
fast
enough
said
the
conductor
grimly
he
turned
to
the
frenchman
it
tough
luck
sir
to
miss
transpacific
connections
but
i
guess
that
the
man
you
got
to
thank
for
the
hawk
what
is
that
who
is
the
hawk
the
frenchman
had
lost
his
poise
he
was
gesticulating
violently
now
i
tell
you
said
the
reporter
briskly
he
the
man
that
got
your
original
reign
of
terror
skinned
a
me
he
an
sing
convict
and
he
the
head
brains
and
front
of
a
gang
of
criminals
operating
out
here
compared
with
whom
for
pure
deviltry
any
one
of
satan
picked
cohorts
would
look
as
shy
and
retiring
as
a
maiden
lady
of
sixty
who
suddenly
found
herself
in
a
bathing
public
that
the
hawk
yes
me
doctor
meunier
waved
his
hands
as
though
to
ward
off
a
swarm
of
buzzing
bees
i
do
not
understand
he
spluttered
angrily
i
do
not
care
to
understand
you
do
not
speak
english
i
understand
only
of
the
delay
he
caught
at
the
conductor
sleeve
you
there
not
something
that
can
be
done
i
do
know
sir
said
the
conductor
we
be
in
selkirk
now
in
a
few
minutes
and
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
to
see
lanson
the
the
conductor
retired
the
frenchman
sat
down
in
his
chair
mopped
his
face
with
a
handkerchief
and
stared
from
one
to
another
of
his
fellow
passengers
messieurs
it
is
necessary
it
is
imperative
that
i
catch
the
steamer
he
cried
frantically
what
am
i
to
do
lanson
a
good
head
he
fix
you
up
some
way
said
the
reporter
soothingly
do
you
worry
i
mighty
sorry
for
you
doctor
meunier
upon
my
say
this
is
some
of
a
climax
the
frenchman
glared
for
an
instant
then
leaning
forward
suddenly
shook
his
fist
under
the
other
nose
young
man
damn
your
story
he
snarled
distractedly
the
hawk
retired
once
more
behind
his
newspaper
the
reporter
was
pacifying
the
excited
frenchman
the
hawk
was
not
interested
in
that
the
message
that
single
word
which
had
puzzled
him
was
transparently
clear
had
been
from
the
moment
the
conductor
had
spoken
the
surmise
of
the
railroad
officials
even
if
it
were
no
more
than
surmise
on
their
part
was
indubitably
the
slight
detail
of
his
own
participation
in
the
affair
the
wire
devils
had
blown
up
the
rainy
river
bridge
this
as
a
detached
fact
did
not
interest
him
were
quite
capable
of
blowing
up
a
bridge
or
anything
else
that
was
a
detail
but
they
were
quite
incapable
of
doing
it
without
a
very
good
and
sufficient
reason
and
one
that
promised
returns
of
a
very
material
nature
to
themselves
what
was
the
game
why
the
rainy
river
bridge
why
this
morning
why
at
this
time
the
rainy
river
bridge
was
but
a
few
miles
west
of
selkirk
eyes
strayed
over
his
newspaper
again
and
rested
mildly
upon
the
frenchman
little
black
handbag
that
was
quite
slim
and
not
over
long
that
was
of
such
a
size
in
fact
that
it
might
readily
be
concealed
under
one
coat
for
instance
without
attracting
undue
with
the
bridge
out
a
passenger
say
on
the
coast
limited
this
noon
would
experience
an
annoying
somewhat
lengthened
but
unavoidable
interruption
in
his
journey
the
passenger
might
even
be
forced
to
spend
the
night
in
selkirk
and
very
much
might
happen
in
a
selkirk
it
was
a
little
elaborate
it
seemed
as
though
it
might
perhaps
have
been
accomplished
with
a
little
less
lack
of
finesse
and
exceeding
cunning
was
in
his
experience
an
unmerited
reproach
where
that
unknown
brain
that
planned
and
plotted
the
wire
devils
acts
was
concerned
but
however
that
might
be
the
reason
that
the
rainy
river
bridge
was
out
now
appeared
quite
obviously
a
very
excited
foreigner
and
a
little
black
handbag
whose
contents
were
valued
at
the
modest
sum
of
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
and
i
wonder
said
the
hawk
almost
plaintively
to
himself
i
wonder
which
of
us
will
cash
in
on
that
the
hawk
rose
leisurely
from
his
chair
as
the
train
reached
selkirk
he
permitted
the
frenchman
the
selkirk
physician
and
the
reporter
to
descend
to
the
platform
in
advance
of
him
but
as
they
hurried
through
the
station
and
around
to
the
entrance
leading
upstairs
to
the
divisional
offices
obviously
with
the
superintendent
office
as
their
objective
the
hawk
in
the
privileged
character
of
an
interested
fellow
traveller
fell
into
step
with
the
reporter
the
four
entered
the
superintendent
office
and
from
an
unobtrusive
position
just
inside
the
door
the
hawk
listened
to
the
conversation
he
heard
the
superintendent
confirm
the
conductor
story
and
express
genuine
regret
at
the
frenchman
plight
as
he
admitted
it
to
be
a
practical
certainty
that
the
other
would
miss
his
connection
in
san
francisco
the
frenchman
but
grew
the
more
excited
he
suggested
a
special
train
from
the
western
side
of
the
could
get
him
across
in
a
boat
he
said
the
superintendent
explained
that
traffic
in
the
mountains
beyond
was
already
demoralised
the
frenchman
raved
begged
pleaded
suddenly
the
hawk
sucked
in
his
breath
softly
the
frenchman
was
backing
his
appeal
for
a
special
with
the
offer
to
pay
any
sum
demanded
and
had
taken
a
pocketbook
from
his
pocket
the
hawk
eyes
aimlessly
sought
the
toes
of
his
boots
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
fat
wad
of
bills
a
very
fat
wad
whose
denominations
were
of
a
large
and
extremely
interesting
nature
the
official
shook
his
head
it
was
not
a
question
of
money
nor
was
the
other
ability
to
pay
in
question
later
on
he
lanson
would
know
better
what
the
situation
was
meanwhile
he
suggested
that
doctor
meunier
should
go
to
the
hotel
and
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
for
the
moment
the
selkirk
physician
here
intervened
and
agreeing
with
the
superintendent
offered
to
escort
the
frenchman
to
the
corona
hotel
the
hawk
as
one
whose
curiosity
was
satiated
but
satiated
at
the
expense
of
time
he
could
ill
afford
nodded
briefly
to
the
reporter
who
stood
nearest
to
him
and
quietly
left
the
room
five
minutes
later
standing
in
another
hawk
rapidly
changed
the
suit
he
had
been
wearing
for
one
of
a
darker
material
from
the
pockets
of
the
discarded
suit
he
transferred
to
the
pockets
of
the
suit
he
had
just
put
on
amongst
other
things
his
automatic
and
his
bunch
of
skeleton
keys
he
opened
his
trunk
removed
the
false
tray
and
smiled
with
a
sort
of
grim
complacency
as
his
glance
inventoried
its
unhallowed
contents
and
particularly
he
smiled
as
opening
a
little
box
he
allowed
a
stream
of
gleaming
stones
to
trickle
out
into
the
palm
of
his
twenty
thousand
dollars
worth
of
diamonds
robbed
from
the
fast
mail
three
nights
ago
some
haul
observed
the
hawk
softly
and
with
any
luck
there
be
something
else
there
worth
the
whole
outfit
put
together
before
is
he
replaced
the
diamonds
in
the
box
the
box
in
the
tray
and
spoke
again
but
now
his
smile
was
hard
and
twisted
not
an
article
there
but
he
had
scooped
from
under
the
noses
of
the
gang
yes
i
guess
i
go
out
like
you
snuff
a
candle
if
they
ever
get
me
and
i
guess
they
the
hawk
however
had
not
opened
the
trunk
purely
for
the
opportunity
it
afforded
of
inspecting
these
few
mementos
interesting
as
they
might
be
it
was
an
excellent
safeguard
to
change
his
clothes
but
it
would
avail
him
very
little
any
one
still
permitted
to
face
from
the
top
of
the
tray
where
it
lay
upon
the
packages
of
banknotes
that
had
once
reposed
in
the
paymaster
safe
the
hawk
picked
up
a
mask
and
slipped
it
into
his
pocket
he
fitted
the
false
tray
back
into
the
lid
of
the
trunk
closed
the
trunk
locked
it
put
on
a
soft
felt
hat
locked
the
door
of
his
room
behind
him
descended
the
narrow
staircase
and
stepped
out
on
the
street
his
destination
was
the
corona
hotel
but
there
was
no
particular
hurry
undoubtedly
from
the
moment
the
frenchman
had
left
the
train
some
or
one
of
the
gang
had
fastened
on
the
man
trail
but
the
companionship
of
the
selkirk
physician
guaranteed
the
immediate
safety
his
own
plan
as
far
as
it
was
matured
was
very
simple
he
meant
to
spot
if
he
could
should
that
particular
member
or
members
of
the
gang
be
unknown
to
him
personally
the
man
or
men
selected
by
the
wire
devils
to
shadow
the
then
watch
the
gang
the
hawk
had
no
intention
whatever
of
making
an
attempt
on
the
frenchman
property
with
the
gang
watching
would
have
been
little
less
than
the
act
of
a
fool
who
was
bent
on
suicide
since
therefore
he
had
no
choice
in
the
matter
he
was
quite
content
to
have
the
gang
take
the
initiatory
risk
in
relieving
the
frenchman
of
the
handbag
after
hawk
old
twisted
smile
was
back
on
his
lips
as
he
walked
that
it
became
his
business
to
see
that
the
bag
did
not
get
very
far
out
of
his
sight
he
reached
and
crossed
the
city
park
upon
which
the
corona
hotel
fronted
entered
the
hotel
and
sauntering
leisurely
through
the
lobby
approached
the
desk
he
glanced
casually
over
the
register
then
lighting
a
cigar
he
selected
a
chair
near
the
front
windows
where
he
could
command
a
general
view
of
the
lobby
and
sat
down
doctor
meunier
room
was
number
once
the
hawk
eyes
lazily
surveyed
the
lobby
thereafter
they
appeared
to
be
intent
on
what
was
passing
in
the
street
he
was
in
luck
the
first
trick
at
least
had
gone
to
him
lolling
in
a
chair
near
the
elevator
doors
and
apparently
drowsy
from
a
heavy
luncheon
bantam
the
hawk
smoked
on
half
an
hour
went
by
the
bantam
appeared
to
awaken
with
a
start
smiled
sheepishly
about
him
went
over
to
the
news
stand
bought
a
returned
to
his
seat
the
hawk
finished
his
cigar
rose
strolled
to
the
main
entrance
and
went
out
the
bantam
could
be
safely
trusted
to
see
that
doctor
meunier
did
not
vanish
into
thin
air
he
would
do
the
like
for
the
bantam
he
crossed
over
into
the
park
the
hawk
chose
a
sheltered
by
a
row
of
trees
he
had
the
corner
upon
which
the
hotel
was
built
diagonally
before
him
and
could
see
both
the
side
entrance
on
the
cross
street
and
the
front
entrance
on
the
main
thoroughfare
the
hawk
vigil
however
was
not
immediately
rewarded
an
hour
yet
the
greater
portion
of
the
afternoon
five
came
a
newsboy
passed
crying
the
evening
journal
the
hawk
bought
one
a
headline
in
heavy
type
on
the
front
page
instantly
caught
his
eye
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
in
a
lead
capsule
and
beneath
this
still
in
assertive
type
famous
french
surgeon
en
route
to
japan
with
fortune
in
radium
misses
connections
through
destruction
of
railroad
bridge
offers
company
large
sum
of
money
for
special
train
to
the
coast
yes
observed
the
hawk
caustically
and
even
if
i
known
anything
about
it
before
i
have
had
a
thanks
to
this
sting
you
would
it
the
papers
hand
you
a
then
they
wonder
at
crime
the
story
itself
ran
a
column
and
a
half
the
hawk
began
to
rather
to
divide
his
attention
between
the
story
and
the
hotel
entrances
the
reporter
had
certainly
set
out
with
the
intention
of
overlooking
no
detail
that
could
be
turned
to
account
his
meeting
and
conversation
with
the
frenchman
in
the
car
were
breezily
set
forth
the
member
of
a
prominent
family
in
japan
artfully
disguised
or
perhaps
better
disclosed
no
less
august
a
personage
than
the
emperor
himself
the
value
of
radium
both
intrinsically
and
scientifically
was
interestingly
dealt
with
and
the
surgeon
black
handbag
with
its
priceless
contents
was
minutely
described
and
featured
the
hawk
had
reached
this
point
when
suddenly
the
newspaper
and
the
reporter
version
of
the
story
lost
interest
for
him
doctor
meunier
gripping
his
little
black
handbag
tenaciously
had
stepped
out
through
the
main
entrance
of
the
hotel
and
was
walking
briskly
down
the
street
a
moment
later
the
bantam
sauntered
through
the
doorway
and
started
in
the
same
direction
a
hundred
yards
behind
the
frenchman
the
hawk
with
a
grim
smile
folded
his
paper
stuffed
it
into
his
pocket
rose
from
the
bench
crossed
the
street
and
fell
into
the
hundred
yards
behind
the
bantam
it
was
still
light
though
it
was
beginning
to
grow
light
for
any
highway
thuggery
and
hawk
gradually
closed
the
gap
between
himself
and
the
bantam
to
half
the
original
distance
the
chase
led
on
for
a
half
dozen
blocks
then
turned
into
one
of
the
crowded
streets
of
the
shopping
district
and
proceeded
in
a
downtown
direction
and
then
abruptly
the
hawk
dropped
further
behind
the
bantam
again
and
crossed
to
the
opposite
sidewalk
it
was
perhaps
only
fancy
but
intuitively
he
felt
that
he
too
in
turn
was
being
followed
his
hat
brim
hiding
his
face
was
pulled
a
little
farther
forward
over
his
eyes
as
he
hurried
now
until
he
was
abreast
of
the
frenchman
intuition
or
not
it
was
quite
possible
and
even
likely
that
one
of
the
gang
might
cover
the
bantam
the
hawk
scowled
he
could
not
be
sure
and
he
dared
not
put
it
to
more
than
a
casual
test
for
he
could
not
afford
to
lose
sight
of
the
bantam
he
paused
took
a
slip
of
paper
from
his
pocket
and
as
though
having
consulted
it
for
an
address
appeared
to
scan
the
signs
and
numbers
on
the
stores
in
his
immediate
vicinity
the
frenchman
had
passed
by
the
bantam
was
directly
opposite
to
him
now
across
the
street
the
keen
eyes
searched
the
stream
of
pedestrians
behind
the
bantam
and
then
suddenly
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
returned
the
paper
to
his
man
in
a
light
suit
and
brown
derby
hat
had
stepped
out
of
the
crowd
and
was
leisurely
lighting
a
cigarette
in
a
doorway
just
across
from
where
he
the
hawk
stood
the
hawk
went
on
but
keeping
in
the
rear
of
the
bantam
now
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
he
was
still
not
sure
but
in
any
case
neither
could
the
man
in
the
brown
derby
be
sure
that
he
the
hawk
was
following
the
bantam
so
far
then
granted
that
he
was
being
followed
it
was
an
even
break
at
the
next
crossing
the
frenchman
accosted
a
policeman
and
as
though
he
had
received
directions
at
once
turned
down
the
cross
street
the
hawk
as
he
followed
smiled
grimly
the
cross
street
automatically
verified
the
suspicions
of
the
man
in
the
brown
the
man
in
the
brown
derby
had
any
suspicions
to
verify
but
at
one
and
the
same
time
it
also
answered
the
hawk
own
question
the
hawk
in
turn
made
use
of
a
doorway
he
could
afford
to
allow
the
bantam
temporarily
the
lead
of
an
extra
half
block
now
for
there
were
fewer
people
on
the
cross
street
and
he
would
still
be
able
to
keep
the
other
in
sight
a
minute
two
then
the
hawk
picked
up
the
bantam
trail
again
the
man
in
the
brown
derby
hat
had
passed
by
the
corner
and
continued
on
along
the
main
street
and
yet
still
the
hawk
was
not
satisfied
and
it
was
not
until
after
he
had
repeated
the
same
manouvre
some
four
or
five
times
as
the
frenchman
leading
turned
into
different
streets
that
he
was
finally
convinced
that
neither
the
man
in
the
brown
derby
hat
nor
any
one
else
was
interested
in
his
movements
the
chase
since
leaving
the
main
street
had
wound
its
way
through
the
less
populous
wholesale
ended
at
the
railway
station
the
frenchman
passed
along
the
front
of
the
building
and
disappeared
through
the
doorway
leading
upstairs
to
the
divisional
offices
his
object
being
it
now
appeared
obvious
to
obtain
another
interview
with
the
superintendent
the
bantam
disappeared
inside
the
main
entranceway
of
the
station
evidently
to
await
the
frenchman
reappearance
and
the
hawk
on
the
far
side
of
the
street
slipped
into
the
lane
that
had
served
him
many
times
as
a
thoroughfare
between
the
station
and
his
room
over
the
saloon
two
blocks
away
it
was
growing
dark
now
a
half
hour
went
by
still
the
hawk
crouched
in
the
shadow
of
the
building
that
bordered
the
lane
the
street
lights
went
on
the
six
whistle
blew
from
the
shops
over
across
the
tracks
either
the
frenchman
was
a
visitor
not
easy
to
get
rid
of
or
lanson
was
out
and
the
other
was
awaiting
the
superintendent
return
but
the
hawk
patience
was
infinite
another
fifteen
minutes
dragged
away
then
the
office
door
opened
the
frenchman
emerged
and
started
back
uptown
the
bantam
appeared
from
the
main
entranceway
and
started
after
him
the
chase
was
on
again
the
hawk
followed
the
frenchman
seemingly
sticking
to
rule
of
thumb
and
following
the
directions
he
had
received
on
the
way
down
took
exactly
the
same
route
on
the
way
back
but
now
the
neighborhood
presented
an
entirely
different
aspect
the
wholesale
houses
were
closed
the
streets
deserted
dark
and
poorly
lighted
the
hawk
hugged
the
shadows
of
the
buildings
craftily
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
was
it
coming
now
certainly
the
gang
would
go
far
before
finding
a
more
ideal
opportunity
and
the
bantam
if
he
had
realised
that
fact
could
easily
have
sent
or
telephoned
a
message
from
the
station
he
the
hawk
had
not
cared
to
take
the
risk
of
following
the
bantam
bantam
might
remember
having
seen
him
in
the
hotel
lobby
and
then
the
hawk
lips
thinned
was
the
old
old
game
they
were
on
the
cross
street
a
little
less
than
a
block
distant
from
the
main
street
ahead
the
bantam
began
to
close
up
on
the
frenchman
the
hawk
now
crouching
low
slipped
almost
literally
from
doorway
to
doorway
two
men
apparently
drunk
and
quarrelling
were
coming
down
the
block
toward
the
frenchman
the
bantam
closed
to
within
a
few
yards
of
his
quarry
the
brawl
attained
its
height
as
the
two
men
reached
the
frenchman
one
man
struck
the
other
they
clenched
and
smashing
into
the
frenchman
knocked
him
down
his
hat
flew
in
one
direction
the
handbag
in
another
the
brawlers
curiously
did
not
resume
their
quarrel
but
lounged
a
few
paces
call
of
the
bantam
the
hawk
squeezed
in
his
doorway
directly
opposite
the
scene
kept
his
eyes
on
the
bantam
if
the
play
had
lacked
originality
before
it
did
not
lack
it
now
the
bantam
stooped
picked
up
the
handbag
and
as
he
stooped
again
for
the
hat
slipped
the
handbag
under
his
coat
and
slipped
another
a
carefully
prepared
from
under
his
coat
and
into
his
hand
the
frenchman
was
rising
dazedly
to
his
feet
the
bantam
stepped
hurriedly
forward
holding
out
hat
and
bag
i
hope
you
not
hurt
sir
the
hawk
heard
him
then
the
two
moved
on
together
toward
the
corner
the
hawk
shook
his
shoulders
in
a
queer
almost
sort
of
way
as
he
followed
again
and
then
he
smiled
as
queerly
the
bantam
had
the
bag
now
and
if
he
the
hawk
were
permitted
to
hazard
an
opinion
the
wire
devils
had
very
kindly
picked
the
fruit
again
for
him
to
eat
at
the
corner
the
bantam
shook
hands
with
the
frenchman
and
stepping
out
into
the
street
signalled
an
approaching
car
quick
alert
on
the
instant
the
hawk
safe
in
the
protection
of
the
crowded
sidewalk
moved
swiftly
along
in
the
direction
that
the
car
would
take
his
eyes
searching
the
street
on
both
sides
for
a
taxicab
the
street
car
passed
him
but
stopped
at
the
next
corner
and
he
caught
up
with
it
again
and
then
over
his
shoulder
he
saw
a
taxi
coming
up
behind
him
he
stepped
from
the
curb
and
stopped
it
sorry
sir
said
the
chauffeur
i
going
after
a
you
got
one
a
good
one
said
the
hawk
quietly
he
had
opened
the
bill
lay
in
the
chauffeur
hand
yes
but
look
here
sir
said
the
chauffeur
a
little
dubiously
i
get
into
trouble
for
this
the
hawk
had
stepped
inside
and
lowered
the
window
between
himself
and
the
chauffeur
follow
that
car
said
the
hawk
pleasantly
and
while
we
on
the
crowded
streets
do
get
so
far
behind
it
that
you
ca
close
up
near
enough
to
see
who
gets
off
every
time
it
stops
and
worry
about
your
another
ten
coming
on
top
of
the
regular
fare
that
good
enough
is
it
i
guess
i
not
kicking
admitted
the
chauffeur
the
taxi
started
forward
he
looked
back
over
his
shoulder
at
the
hawk
what
the
lay
maybe
said
the
hawk
mind
yourself
it
stopping
again
keep
where
i
can
see
both
sides
of
the
i
get
you
said
the
chauffeur
leave
it
to
me
block
after
block
was
passed
the
street
car
stopping
frequently
the
hawk
in
the
body
of
the
taxi
knelt
behind
the
chauffeur
back
his
eyes
held
steadily
on
the
street
car
ahead
the
bantam
did
not
alight
the
street
car
began
to
run
out
into
the
suburbs
the
taxicab
with
lights
out
now
risking
the
city
ordinance
dropped
back
to
a
more
respectful
distance
in
the
rear
the
district
became
less
settled
the
houses
farther
apart
the
street
lights
were
single
incandescents
now
and
these
few
and
far
between
there
was
one
passenger
left
in
the
bantam
the
chauffeur
spoke
abruptly
we
pretty
near
the
end
of
the
line
he
said
all
right
the
hawk
answered
stop
when
the
car
about
this
distance
we
not
likely
to
be
a
moment
later
he
stepped
from
the
taxi
wait
for
me
here
he
directed
the
bantam
leaving
the
street
car
had
started
off
at
a
sharp
pace
past
the
end
of
the
car
line
it
was
little
more
than
a
country
road
now
only
a
house
here
and
there
the
bantam
just
discernible
in
the
darkness
had
a
lead
of
perhaps
a
hundred
yards
and
the
hawk
moving
stealthily
began
to
creep
nearer
and
still
nearer
until
the
hundred
yards
were
then
suddenly
with
a
low
muttered
exclamation
he
threw
himself
flat
on
the
ground
the
bantam
abreast
of
a
house
from
which
there
showed
a
light
in
the
side
window
had
turned
in
abruptly
from
the
road
a
glow
of
light
spread
out
as
the
front
door
opened
the
hawk
lay
motionless
then
the
bantam
entered
and
the
door
was
closed
again
a
little
later
a
form
appeared
at
the
side
window
a
hand
reached
up
and
the
shade
was
drawn
nice
respectable
neighborhood
too
observed
the
hawk
tersely
wonder
if
it
the
lair
and
if
the
master
spider
in
there
now
he
was
creeping
forward
now
across
a
small
lawn
he
neared
the
side
window
it
was
open
and
the
shade
lacked
a
tiny
though
inviting
space
of
reaching
to
the
sill
a
murmur
of
voices
came
from
within
there
was
not
a
sound
from
the
hawk
and
then
from
beneath
the
window
which
was
low
and
not
more
than
four
feet
from
the
ground
he
raised
himself
up
cautiously
and
suddenly
his
dark
eyes
narrowed
it
was
not
the
master
was
the
butcher
whose
treachery
had
nearly
done
for
him
that
night
in
the
paymaster
office
the
man
whom
he
had
promised
should
one
day
remember
he
could
hear
now
and
he
could
see
it
was
a
sitting
room
such
as
one
might
find
anywhere
in
a
house
whose
occupants
were
in
comfortable
circumstances
it
was
cosily
and
tastefully
furnished
it
bore
no
sign
of
criminal
affiliation
it
was
as
it
were
a
sort
of
alibi
in
itself
a
telephone
stood
on
the
table
beside
a
pile
of
magazines
the
latter
flanked
by
an
ornamental
reading
lamp
deep
leather
lounging
chairs
added
to
the
inviting
and
homelike
appearance
of
the
incongruity
was
in
the
butcher
thin
face
and
in
the
coarse
vicious
features
of
the
short
stocky
bantam
as
they
faced
each
other
across
the
table
where
the
others
d
say
demanded
the
bantam
out
said
the
butcher
the
chief
called
an
hour
ago
i
do
know
what
up
i
guess
you
and
i
keep
house
here
he
said
you
were
to
stay
mouser
and
jack
were
to
report
to
kirschell
were
they
yes
that
what
they
well
all
right
the
butcher
shrugged
his
shoulders
none
of
our
hunt
i
suppose
you
got
it
did
you
be
here
sure
i
got
it
answered
the
bantam
what
d
think
let
have
a
look
said
the
butcher
eagerly
the
chief
says
we
can
cash
in
on
it
for
fifty
fifty
thousand
the
bantam
growled
as
he
unbuttoned
his
coat
and
taking
out
the
bag
laid
it
on
the
table
i
thought
it
was
worth
a
hundred
thousand
so
it
the
butcher
was
opening
the
bag
but
it
no
cinch
to
turn
it
into
money
without
a
big
the
butcher
opened
the
lead
box
took
out
the
lead
cylinder
and
balanced
it
speculatively
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
the
bantam
regarded
it
distrustfully
it
do
look
like
fifty
cents
to
me
he
commented
finally
i
know
said
the
butcher
facetiously
but
your
bum
bantam
have
any
trouble
the
bantam
grinned
not
what
you
notice
after
the
mouser
and
jack
smashed
into
him
the
poor
old
boob
did
know
what
had
happened
till
i
was
handing
him
his
hat
and
the
other
bag
i
guess
he
bumped
his
bean
kind
of
hard
on
the
the
butcher
nodded
approvingly
he
was
still
twisting
the
lead
cylinder
around
and
around
in
his
hand
say
suggested
the
bantam
impatiently
after
a
moment
when
you
done
chucking
it
under
the
chin
put
it
to
bed
somewhere
and
if
there
any
grub
in
the
house
lead
me
to
it
i
hungry
all
right
agreed
the
butcher
he
replaced
the
lead
cylinder
in
its
box
and
the
box
in
the
bag
crossed
the
room
opened
a
little
cupboard
in
the
wall
opposite
the
window
laid
the
bag
inside
and
closed
the
cupboard
door
again
come
on
he
said
man
with
the
scar
the
two
men
left
the
room
the
hawk
did
not
move
he
was
fingering
in
a
curiously
sort
of
way
the
edges
of
the
newspaper
that
still
protruded
from
his
pocket
it
was
very
simple
very
easy
the
window
was
open
the
cupboard
was
not
locked
the
room
was
empty
there
were
only
the
bantam
and
the
butcher
to
look
out
for
and
they
were
in
another
part
of
the
house
he
had
only
to
lift
aside
the
window
shade
step
in
steal
across
the
room
and
steal
out
a
prize
it
was
very
inviting
it
seemed
suddenly
as
though
it
were
a
pressing
invitation
to
enter
that
never
leave
it
alive
flashing
quick
through
the
hawk
brain
now
was
a
résumé
of
the
afternoon
of
each
separate
and
individual
occurrence
since
he
had
left
the
train
had
he
after
all
been
followed
if
had
the
bantam
been
warned
he
shook
his
head
as
though
impatient
with
himself
even
apart
from
that
what
he
had
begun
to
suspect
now
would
be
thoroughly
logical
on
the
part
of
the
gang
the
newspaper
supplied
the
key
he
would
unquestionably
have
seen
the
newspaper
that
afternoon
and
he
would
apart
from
being
spared
several
aimless
hours
in
the
park
have
done
exactly
as
he
had
done
and
just
as
unquestionably
be
where
he
was
now
at
this
precise
moment
even
if
he
had
not
been
with
the
frenchman
on
the
train
the
newspaper
placed
him
in
possession
of
the
same
facts
that
the
wire
devils
possessed
they
must
know
that
they
were
therefore
justified
in
assuming
that
he
quite
as
rabidly
as
themselves
would
make
an
attempt
to
steal
the
bag
they
knew
in
that
case
that
he
would
have
discovered
that
they
were
already
at
work
and
they
knew
that
on
a
dozen
occasions
before
that
had
not
prevented
him
from
snatching
the
prize
they
had
already
counted
within
their
grasp
were
they
on
their
guard
a
little
more
than
on
their
guard
were
they
offering
him
on
the
chance
or
with
the
knowledge
that
he
was
here
now
the
opportunity
to
snatch
another
seeing
to
it
that
it
was
for
the
last
time
the
hawk
edged
back
from
the
window
and
silent
as
a
shadow
now
began
to
circuit
the
house
and
then
suddenly
his
suspicion
became
a
certainty
it
was
only
a
little
it
was
enough
the
butcher
had
made
a
misplay
there
was
no
light
in
any
other
a
man
did
not
usually
eat
in
the
dark
it
was
fairly
even
painfully
evident
now
that
the
bantam
and
the
butcher
were
in
say
the
adjoining
room
waiting
for
him
to
enter
through
that
window
into
their
trap
but
there
was
still
the
little
black
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
the
hawk
smile
was
more
ominous
than
pleasant
there
were
other
ways
apart
from
a
even
two
men
especially
if
they
were
caught
napping
had
been
known
to
be
quite
amenable
to
the
influence
of
the
muzzle
of
an
automatic
the
hawk
found
the
back
door
entrance
found
it
used
a
skeleton
key
he
was
perhaps
five
minutes
in
opening
the
door
but
in
those
five
minutes
there
was
no
click
of
lock
as
the
handle
turned
by
infinitesimal
fractions
of
an
inch
no
creak
of
hinge
as
the
door
little
by
little
swung
back
and
was
closed
again
the
silence
was
almost
uncanny
it
was
utter
blackness
by
feeling
out
with
his
hand
he
discovered
he
was
in
a
passageway
he
moved
along
guiding
himself
by
the
sense
of
touch
against
the
wall
his
weight
balanced
and
full
upon
one
foot
before
he
lifted
the
other
for
the
next
step
it
seemed
a
passage
of
interminable
length
that
led
on
and
on
through
blackness
and
silence
in
reality
he
had
come
possibly
thirty
feet
and
had
passed
one
door
and
then
he
began
to
catch
the
sound
of
voices
whispering
the
whisperings
grew
more
distinct
and
became
low
guarded
tones
as
he
moved
now
he
could
distinguish
words
he
flattened
back
against
the
side
of
the
passage
opposite
to
him
was
an
open
door
and
within
the
room
instead
of
blackness
now
was
a
sort
of
murky
gloom
which
was
created
by
a
ray
of
light
that
seeped
in
through
a
partially
open
door
at
the
far
side
of
the
room
the
hawk
fingers
slipped
into
his
slipped
his
mask
over
his
face
he
had
his
bearings
now
the
room
from
which
the
light
came
was
the
baited
trap
the
room
immediately
in
front
of
him
was
the
room
from
which
the
trap
was
to
be
sprung
his
hand
went
to
his
pocket
again
and
came
out
with
his
automatic
it
was
their
move
now
if
when
they
finally
grew
impatient
they
went
back
into
the
lighted
room
or
turned
on
the
light
in
the
room
where
they
were
now
waiting
they
sprang
the
trap
upon
themselves
came
the
bantam
low
the
twitching
of
the
hawk
jaw
muscles
i
do
like
it
i
tell
you
where
is
he
what
he
waiting
for
i
know
he
followed
me
you
saw
him
yourself
from
the
front
room
creeping
across
the
lawn
out
there
take
him
all
this
time
to
get
in
through
that
aw
shut
up
snarled
the
butcher
you
give
any
one
the
creeps
that
all
right
whispered
the
bantam
hoarsely
but
i
said
from
the
start
it
was
a
fool
game
not
to
cover
him
close
on
the
way
back
scare
him
off
sneered
the
butcher
there
but
one
guy
that
pick
up
that
that
the
hawk
butted
in
enough
but
he
butted
in
for
the
last
time
the
two
of
us
are
aplenty
are
we
him
close
on
the
way
scare
him
off
d
think
he
a
fool
no
i
do
curse
him
retorted
the
bantam
and
if
i
had
my
way
i
have
croaked
him
in
broad
daylight
with
a
bullet
through
his
bean
and
finished
him
for
keeps
the
minute
jack
spotted
him
following
me
instead
of
that
jack
never
even
gets
a
look
at
his
you
some
bright
guy
grunted
the
butcher
we
have
had
a
hot
chance
making
a
dead
man
tell
us
where
he
planted
those
diamonds
off
the
fast
mail
not
to
speak
of
a
few
other
little
trifles
the
swine
did
us
out
of
and
you
you
bet
i
do
the
butcher
cut
in
viciously
he
talk
to
save
his
then
i
toss
you
bantam
if
you
like
to
see
who
bumps
him
off
the
hawk
fingers
played
in
a
curious
caressing
motion
over
the
stock
of
the
automatic
in
his
hand
the
twist
on
his
lips
grew
a
little
harder
a
little
more
merciless
there
was
movement
in
the
room
now
one
of
the
two
the
bantam
undoubtedly
in
growing
uneasiness
was
moving
softly
erratically
up
and
down
the
room
it
proved
to
be
the
bantam
well
then
where
the
blazes
is
he
he
burst
out
nervously
aw
shut
up
snarled
the
butcher
savagely
for
the
second
time
the
bantam
shadow
as
the
man
paced
up
and
down
passed
the
doorway
repassed
and
passed
again
i
tell
you
i
do
like
it
he
flung
out
suddenly
something
wrong
if
he
outside
the
house
he
ca
see
anyway
i
going
to
take
a
chance
there
was
a
click
the
light
in
the
passageway
went
a
yell
from
the
bantam
in
the
lightning
spring
from
the
hawk
as
the
other
jerked
a
weapon
the
bantam
went
down
in
a
heap
as
the
hawk
clubbed
weapon
caught
him
on
the
head
it
was
quick
like
the
winking
of
an
eye
from
back
in
the
room
the
butcher
sprang
forward
for
the
the
left
hand
as
they
came
upon
each
other
darting
out
closed
with
the
strength
of
a
steel
vise
on
the
butcher
right
wrist
and
with
a
terrific
wrench
twisted
the
other
arm
halfway
around
it
was
lighter
now
in
the
enough
to
see
the
two
forms
swayed
little
butcher
body
bent
over
as
though
queerly
deformed
slowly
remorselessly
the
hawk
turned
the
arm
in
its
socket
sweat
sprang
to
the
butcher
forehead
his
face
writhed
with
with
a
scream
of
agony
his
revolver
clattered
to
the
floor
you
breaking
god
sake
let
go
he
moaned
the
hawk
kicked
the
revolver
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
take
the
bantam
by
the
shoulders
and
drag
him
into
that
lighted
room
the
hawk
tones
were
flat
unpleasant
i
do
think
i
hit
him
hard
enough
to
take
the
chance
of
leaving
him
there
alone
the
butcher
the
muzzle
of
the
hawk
automatic
pressed
persuasively
against
the
small
of
his
back
he
left
the
bantam
in
the
middle
of
the
sitting
room
floor
and
himself
accepted
a
the
hawk
invitation
you
butcher
the
hawk
voice
had
become
a
drawl
with
his
automatic
covering
the
butcher
he
had
backed
to
the
cupboard
opened
it
and
was
feeling
inside
with
his
left
hand
my
grateful
thanks
and
you
convey
my
hawk
you
our
he
had
slipped
the
little
black
bag
under
his
arm
and
now
his
hand
was
back
in
the
cupboard
again
he
had
felt
a
ball
of
heavy
cord
there
sorry
i
have
a
phony
with
card
you
breach
of
he
smiled
suddenly
the
ball
of
cord
was
in
his
hand
as
he
advanced
toward
the
butcher
chair
he
set
the
little
black
bag
down
on
the
table
the
butcher
seemed
to
have
lost
all
his
characteristic
ferocity
the
sharp
little
ferret
eyes
rested
anywhere
but
on
the
hawk
and
on
his
face
was
a
sickly
grin
stand
up
commanded
the
hawk
was
knotting
the
end
of
the
cord
into
a
noose
hands
behind
your
together
thank
you
he
slipped
the
noose
over
the
butcher
hands
and
began
to
wind
the
cord
around
the
other
wrists
the
butcher
winced
i
sorry
said
the
hawk
apologetically
but
it
all
i
have
the
cord
is
rather
thin
and
i
afraid
it
may
cut
into
strong
enough
to
allow
you
any
play
you
know
and
by
the
way
butcher
i
heard
the
bantam
say
that
i
was
spotted
on
the
way
presume
he
meant
on
the
way
down
to
the
station
be
honest
and
admit
i
disappointed
in
myself
would
you
mind
explaining
was
quite
convinced
there
was
no
one
behind
there
was
the
butcher
risked
a
sneer
mabbe
the
french
guy
was
heard
telephoning
to
the
station
and
the
bantam
passed
on
the
word
nobody
had
to
follow
behind
all
there
was
to
do
knowing
where
the
frenchy
was
going
was
to
dodge
around
the
blocks
ahead
and
keep
hidden
down
the
different
intersecting
streets
and
see
if
the
same
guy
kept
going
by
the
corners
after
the
thank
you
butcher
murmured
the
hawk
gratefully
that
lets
me
out
a
little
does
it
he
wound
the
cord
again
and
again
around
the
butcher
wrists
knotted
it
shoved
the
other
unceremoniously
back
into
the
chair
and
tied
the
butcher
legs
the
hawk
then
gave
his
attention
to
the
bantam
the
bantam
was
just
beginning
to
regain
consciousness
the
hawk
knelt
down
rolled
the
man
over
on
his
side
and
secured
him
in
the
same
manner
as
he
had
the
butcher
but
with
the
bantam
he
went
a
little
farther
he
transferred
the
bantam
handkerchief
from
the
bantam
pocket
to
the
tied
it
there
he
turned
once
more
to
the
butcher
i
must
apologise
again
he
said
softly
i
hate
to
do
this
felt
for
and
obtained
the
but
the
house
is
unfortunately
close
to
the
road
and
you
might
inadvertently
make
yourself
heard
before
i
got
decently
the
butcher
reply
was
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
the
hawk
about
to
cram
the
handkerchief
into
the
other
mouth
paused
butcher
said
the
hawk
almost
plaintively
if
permit
me
to
deal
in
mixed
metaphors
you
appear
to
have
shed
your
too
awfully
docile
you
got
the
goods
muttered
the
butcher
sullenly
what
more
do
he
stopped
suddenly
his
eyes
met
the
hawk
the
telephone
on
the
table
was
ringing
the
hawk
hesitated
into
the
butcher
eyes
narrowed
now
there
seemed
to
have
come
a
mocking
gleam
the
telephone
rang
again
and
then
the
hawk
reached
out
abruptly
and
took
the
receiver
from
the
hook
hello
he
said
gruffly
four
x
who
that
responded
a
voice
there
was
something
familiar
about
the
voice
but
he
could
not
on
the
instant
place
it
the
hawk
mind
even
as
he
answered
was
swiftly
cataloguing
every
member
of
the
gang
known
to
him
in
an
effort
to
identify
it
the
bantam
he
said
all
right
replied
the
voice
give
me
the
hold
the
line
answered
the
hawk
he
placed
his
hand
over
the
transmitter
the
voice
was
still
eluding
him
he
turned
and
eyed
the
butcher
four
x
wants
you
all
the
drawl
all
the
insouciance
was
gone
now
his
voice
was
hard
with
menace
cold
as
death
and
going
to
speak
to
you
going
to
say
what
i
tell
you
to
say
but
before
you
begin
i
want
you
to
remember
the
little
account
between
us
that
been
hanging
over
since
that
night
in
the
paymaster
office
if
you
make
a
break
if
you
try
to
frame
settle
that
account
here
while
you
sit
in
that
chair
if
you
hesitate
on
a
word
i
not
through
my
pocket
you
yellow
cur
understand
do
kid
yourself
on
this
butcher
if
i
nod
my
head
say
no
more
now
the
butcher
had
sunk
back
in
his
chair
there
was
fear
in
his
face
it
was
white
and
he
circled
his
lips
with
his
tongue
beneath
the
mask
the
hawk
lips
were
a
straight
line
he
laid
down
his
automatic
on
the
table
placed
the
receiver
to
his
own
ear
and
held
the
transmitter
to
the
butcher
lips
go
ahead
ordered
the
hawk
ask
him
what
he
his
fingers
cupped
and
pressed
over
the
transmitter
lifted
hello
said
the
butcher
what
is
it
that
you
butcher
everything
all
right
inquired
the
voice
the
hawk
nodded
yes
said
the
butcher
well
open
up
a
bit
complained
the
voice
did
you
get
him
the
voice
was
speaking
on
the
hawk
lips
had
set
a
little
tighter
he
had
recognised
the
voice
now
his
fingers
were
pressed
over
the
transmitter
again
tell
him
you
laid
me
out
cold
instructed
the
hawk
and
that
i
have
regained
consciousness
yet
now
the
voice
had
ceased
speaking
the
hawk
fingers
lifted
again
we
beaned
him
said
the
butcher
he
still
good
chuckled
the
voice
i
be
up
there
by
and
by
tell
him
to
stay
where
he
is
that
it
will
the
hawk
clipped
off
his
words
the
butcher
delivered
the
message
the
snarl
in
his
voice
entirely
to
the
hawk
liking
what
questioned
the
voice
i
did
get
repeat
whispered
the
hawk
the
butcher
repeated
o
came
back
the
answer
yes
i
guess
you
right
so
long
say
prompted
the
hawk
growled
the
butcher
the
hawk
replaced
the
receiver
on
the
hook
and
the
instrument
on
the
table
the
butcher
lips
were
livid
the
hawk
picked
up
his
automatic
and
leaned
forward
his
eyes
on
a
level
with
the
butcher
what
that
fellow
moniker
butcher
the
butcher
hesitated
the
automatic
crept
forward
an
inch
parson
the
butcher
voice
choked
with
mingled
rage
and
fear
parson
joe
eh
repeated
the
hawk
ruminatingly
was
he
the
chap
who
pulled
that
con
game
on
the
riverdale
bank
back
in
new
york
state
about
six
years
ago
and
afterwards
got
cornered
by
the
police
in
ike
morrissey
gambling
hell
and
was
caught
because
he
nearly
bled
to
death
with
his
wrist
half
off
trying
to
get
through
a
broken
window
pane
he
got
four
spaces
that
him
if
you
say
so
it
must
have
been
there
was
a
leer
in
the
butcher
voice
was
it
the
automatic
touched
the
butcher
breast
yes
said
the
butcher
thank
you
smiled
the
hawk
he
gagged
the
butcher
with
the
handkerchief
tied
it
securely
into
place
stood
up
picked
up
the
little
black
bag
switched
off
the
electric
reading
lamp
moved
to
the
window
and
drew
aside
the
shade
we
let
that
account
stand
open
for
a
little
while
longer
butcher
he
said
softly
just
a
little
while
he
swung
out
of
the
window
dropped
to
the
ground
ran
across
the
lawn
and
gained
the
road
his
mask
and
automatic
were
back
in
his
pockets
his
fingers
felt
and
patted
the
little
black
bag
under
his
coat
always
play
your
luck
whispered
the
hawk
confidentially
to
himself
it
seems
to
me
i
saw
a
little
loose
change
in
doctor
meunier
and
i
do
think
he
opened
the
duplicate
bag
yet
and
stirred
up
a
fuss
it
is
much
compared
with
a
hundred
thousand
or
even
fifty
to
quote
the
butcher
but
little
bit
added
to
what
you
he
fell
to
whistling
the
tune
pleasantly
under
his
breath
as
he
hurried
along
the
road
a
minute
later
he
had
regained
the
taxicab
drop
me
a
block
this
side
of
the
give
her
all
got
he
directed
crisply
d
get
him
demanded
the
chauffeur
eagerly
my
friend
replied
the
hawk
gently
as
he
stepped
into
the
taxi
if
you
think
it
over
you
come
to
the
conclusion
that
you
really
do
want
to
know
take
it
from
me
that
the
less
you
wise
about
the
wiser
you
will
be
now
cut
her
loose
it
had
taken
a
good
thirty
minutes
on
the
trip
up
it
took
less
than
half
of
that
by
a
more
direct
route
for
the
return
journey
at
the
corner
a
block
from
the
hotel
the
hawk
crumpled
two
generous
into
the
chauffeur
hand
and
bade
the
man
he
traversed
the
block
entered
the
hotel
lobby
and
ignoring
the
elevators
leisurely
and
nonchalantly
ascended
the
staircase
to
the
first
floor
from
the
landing
he
noted
the
room
numbers
opposite
to
him
and
with
these
as
a
guide
passed
on
along
the
corridor
to
where
it
turned
at
right
angles
at
the
corner
of
the
building
and
halted
before
room
no
a
light
showing
above
the
transom
indicated
that
the
frenchman
was
within
he
had
passed
one
or
two
people
no
one
had
paid
any
attention
to
him
why
should
they
he
glanced
up
and
down
the
corridor
for
the
moment
was
empty
he
tried
the
door
was
locked
his
right
hand
in
his
side
pocket
closed
over
his
automatic
he
pressed
close
to
the
door
knocked
gently
with
his
left
with
his
left
hand
reached
quickly
into
his
pocket
for
his
mask
who
there
the
frenchman
called
out
message
for
you
sir
the
hawk
answered
footsteps
crossed
the
room
the
key
turned
in
the
in
a
flash
the
hawk
slipping
on
his
mask
had
pushed
the
door
open
closed
it
behind
him
and
the
frenchman
was
staring
into
the
muzzle
of
the
automatic
mon
dieu
gasped
the
frenchman
faintly
that
right
said
the
hawk
coolly
do
speak
any
louder
than
that
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
significantly
as
he
locked
the
door
the
frenchman
was
evidently
fighting
for
his
nerve
is
it
he
stammered
what
is
it
that
you
want
it
was
almost
a
reassuring
smile
that
flickered
on
the
hawk
lips
and
his
voice
did
not
belie
was
purely
conversational
in
its
tones
i
was
reading
in
the
paper
this
afternoon
about
the
famous
doctor
meunier
i
a
bit
of
a
scientist
myself
in
an
amateur
way
and
i
particularly
interested
in
radium
when
there
enough
of
it
ah
my
radium
that
is
what
you
want
cried
out
the
frenchman
wildly
the
duplicate
bag
lay
on
the
bed
he
ran
for
it
and
snatched
it
up
no
that
you
shall
not
have
you
come
to
steal
my
radium
you
jump
at
conclusions
doctor
said
the
hawk
patiently
since
it
is
already
stolen
stolen
the
frenchman
then
with
feverish
fingers
opened
the
bag
he
looked
inside
the
bag
dropped
to
the
floor
his
hands
went
up
in
the
air
it
is
he
cried
distractedly
it
is
mon
dieu
my
radium
is
gone
what
shall
i
do
his
hands
were
rumpling
through
his
hair
like
one
demented
what
shall
i
is
gone
well
suggested
the
hawk
suavely
i
thought
perhaps
you
might
like
to
buy
it
back
buy
it
back
are
you
crazy
am
i
crazy
the
man
appeared
to
be
beside
himself
he
flung
out
his
arms
in
mad
gesticulation
with
what
would
i
buy
it
back
it
is
worth
a
hundred
thousands
half
million
francs
you
are
excited
doctor
meunier
said
the
hawk
calmly
from
where
it
bulged
under
his
coat
he
drew
out
the
black
bag
i
said
nothing
about
a
hundred
thousand
the
frenchman
reached
out
a
shaking
hand
pointing
at
the
bag
it
is
you
then
after
all
who
stole
the
are
identical
mon
dieu
what
does
this
mean
i
am
mad
i
do
not
understand
there
was
a
chair
on
each
side
of
the
small
table
near
the
bed
sit
down
invited
the
hawk
indicating
one
with
the
muzzle
of
his
automatic
the
frenchman
sat
down
with
a
helpless
and
abandoned
gesture
of
despair
the
hawk
took
the
other
chair
he
opened
the
bag
opened
the
lead
box
and
laid
the
lead
capsule
on
the
table
do
you
identify
this
he
inquired
pleasantly
the
frenchman
reached
for
it
eagerly
the
hawk
drew
it
back
one
moment
please
doctor
meunier
he
murmured
you
recognise
it
you
are
satisfied
that
it
is
your
tube
of
radium
yes
dieu
but
yes
and
it
is
worth
you
say
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
but
yes
i
tell
you
cried
the
frenchman
a
hundred
it
is
worth
that
quite
so
said
the
hawk
placidly
therefore
doctor
meunier
a
comparatively
small
would
be
willing
to
pay
sum
i
might
add
that
would
be
quite
within
your
quite
within
my
means
repeated
the
frenchman
a
little
dazedly
yes
said
the
hawk
sweetly
and
to
be
specific
let
us
is
in
your
the
frenchman
drew
back
in
his
chair
his
face
blanched
mean
to
rob
me
he
exclaimed
hoarsely
i
do
not
see
it
quite
in
that
the
hawk
voice
was
pained
but
we
will
not
discuss
the
ethics
probably
should
not
agree
i
did
not
steal
your
precious
capsule
from
you
and
i
am
returning
it
not
i
might
say
without
having
incurred
considerable
personal
risk
in
so
doing
perhaps
we
might
better
agree
if
we
called
no
said
the
frenchman
desperately
the
hawk
automatic
tapped
the
table
top
with
a
hint
of
petulance
what
guarantee
have
i
the
frenchman
burst
out
that
you
will
give
me
the
tube
after
you
have
taken
my
money
my
word
said
the
hawk
evenly
am
waiting
doctor
meunier
the
frenchman
hesitated
then
with
an
oath
flung
his
pocketbook
upon
the
table
the
hawk
opened
it
extracted
the
wad
of
bills
that
he
had
seen
exhibited
in
the
superintendent
office
smiled
as
he
fingered
them
and
put
them
in
his
pocket
he
pushed
the
lead
capsule
across
the
suddenly
as
the
other
reached
for
it
the
hawk
was
on
his
feet
his
automatic
flung
forward
his
left
hand
grasping
the
sleeve
they
held
that
way
for
an
instant
eying
each
hawk
left
hand
slowly
pushing
back
the
other
sleeve
and
then
the
hawk
eyes
a
long
jagged
white
scar
on
the
bare
forearm
just
above
the
wrist
shall
i
introduce
joe
purred
the
hawk
the
other
face
was
a
mottled
deepened
to
purple
no
blast
you
he
said
between
his
teeth
i
know
i
did
think
you
knew
me
so
you
called
the
turn
when
the
bantam
followed
the
hawk
shook
his
head
i
never
saw
you
in
my
life
before
he
said
grimly
and
if
it
will
do
you
any
good
to
know
it
i
fell
for
that
radium
you
telephoned
the
butcher
half
an
hour
and
how
did
you
know
me
then
the
other
flung
the
question
fiercely
again
the
hawk
shook
his
head
he
had
no
desire
that
parson
joe
should
know
he
had
been
on
the
limited
that
joe
might
possess
an
inconveniently
retentive
memory
for
faces
and
he
the
hawk
did
not
always
wear
a
mask
maybe
i
guessed
it
parson
he
said
insolently
i
must
was
the
only
thing
that
was
in
the
paper
what
encyclopedia
did
you
get
that
burn
dope
out
of
and
was
the
reporter
lying
or
how
did
you
work
it
to
get
him
on
the
train
parson
joe
was
leaning
forward
over
the
table
fingering
the
lead
capsule
he
suddenly
crushed
it
with
a
blow
of
his
fist
twisted
it
in
two
and
hurled
the
pieces
across
the
floor
we
got
him
up
the
line
on
a
fake
that
did
come
off
he
snarled
there
was
an
instant
silence
then
the
hawk
spoke
nice
amiable
crowd
you
are
parson
the
hawk
voice
was
silken
i
just
beginning
to
appreciate
you
let
see
you
had
to
pull
a
story
that
any
newspaper
would
jump
at
and
feature
you
and
you
had
to
have
a
big
enough
bait
to
make
sure
i
rise
to
it
and
you
had
to
account
for
the
celebrated
doctor
meunier
layover
in
selkirk
and
not
expecting
i
pick
up
the
trail
quite
so
quickly
say
not
until
after
the
paper
had
been
out
a
little
longer
and
you
had
made
another
baiting
trip
or
two
to
lanson
office
you
had
to
account
for
the
famous
gentleman
enforced
stay
through
the
night
if
necessary
and
it
gave
a
big
swing
to
the
story
and
let
you
work
your
stunt
for
the
special
train
that
you
knew
you
could
get
and
you
figured
i
be
even
more
sure
to
see
it
in
the
paper
if
it
was
connected
with
some
pleasant
little
episode
of
so
on
several
counts
you
blew
up
the
the
man
teeth
were
clamped
together
yes
he
choked
and
we
blow
a
dozen
more
to
get
you
you
flatter
me
said
the
hawk
dryly
i
afraid
i
put
you
to
quite
a
little
nothing
sullen
red
furious
parson
joe
face
twitched
you
win
spectacles
were
off
and
the
black
eyes
the
pupils
gone
burned
on
the
but
you
going
out
as
sure
as
god
gave
you
breath
we
get
you
yet
the
butcher
told
me
that
and
so
did
the
time
ago
said
the
hawk
wearily
your
hands
above
the
sure
you
mean
well
he
was
backing
toward
the
door
i
wo
bother
to
relieve
you
of
your
revolver
and
i
do
think
you
telephone
down
to
the
office
it
might
be
awkward
explaining
to
the
police
how
doctor
meunier
lost
his
got
his
medical
degree
i
shall
however
lock
the
door
on
the
outside
as
i
shall
require
a
minute
or
two
to
reach
the
street
and
i
can
not
very
well
go
through
the
hotel
corridor
jerked
his
hand
toward
his
mask
the
other
hands
were
above
the
table
obediently
in
plain
they
were
clenching
and
unclenching
now
the
knuckles
white
the
hawk
reached
behind
him
took
the
key
from
the
lock
listened
opened
the
door
slightly
and
still
facing
into
the
room
still
covering
the
other
with
his
automatic
reached
around
the
door
and
fitted
the
key
into
the
outside
of
the
lock
when
you
get
out
said
the
hawk
as
though
it
were
an
afterthought
i
sure
the
butcher
will
be
glad
to
see
am
afraid
he
is
not
as
comfortable
as
he
might
be
the
black
eyes
with
a
devil
fury
in
them
had
never
left
the
hawk
and
now
the
other
lifted
one
of
his
clenched
hands
above
his
head
i
give
five
years
of
my
a
look
at
your
face
he
whispered
hoarsely
the
hawk
was
backing
through
the
door
it
not
enough
parson
he
said
softly
make
it
clue
two
days
had
days
and
a
night
the
hawk
fingers
drummed
abstractedly
without
sound
on
the
table
top
his
eyes
in
a
curiously
introspective
stare
were
fixed
on
the
closely
drawn
window
shade
across
the
room
from
the
saloon
below
his
unpretentious
lodgings
there
came
muffled
a
chorus
of
voices
in
inebriated
and
discordant
evening
celebration
for
it
was
barely
seven
the
finger
tips
drummed
on
at
times
the
strong
square
chin
was
doggedly
outthrust
at
times
a
frown
gathered
in
heavy
furrows
on
the
hawk
forehead
the
net
at
last
was
beginning
to
tighten
sign
pointed
to
it
he
would
be
a
blind
fool
indeed
who
could
not
read
the
warning
and
a
fool
of
fools
who
would
not
heed
it
his
eyes
strayed
from
the
window
and
rested
upon
the
trunk
that
stood
between
the
table
and
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
his
fingers
abruptly
ceased
their
restless
movements
within
that
trunk
concealed
in
its
false
lid
was
the
loot
totalling
many
thousands
of
dollars
obtained
through
his
knowledge
of
the
wire
devils
secret
code
which
had
enabled
him
their
elaborately
prepared
plans
on
more
occasions
than
one
to
his
own
account
but
it
was
no
longer
a
question
of
outwitting
them
in
order
to
add
to
that
purloined
store
it
was
a
question
of
outwitting
them
in
order
very
plain
the
hawk
might
live
nor
was
it
the
wire
devils
alone
who
threatened
disaster
there
were
other
factors
and
even
if
these
factors
were
less
imminent
as
it
were
less
in
a
measure
to
be
feared
they
were
by
no
means
to
be
ignored
the
police
were
showing
increasing
activity
the
police
circular
which
he
had
once
torn
down
from
the
station
wall
was
now
replaced
by
another
only
with
this
difference
that
where
the
reward
for
the
hawk
capture
had
then
stood
at
five
thousand
dollars
it
now
stood
at
ten
also
last
inadvertently
crouched
under
the
window
of
the
turner
cubbyhole
at
the
rear
of
the
roundhouse
the
chosen
spot
for
lanson
and
confidential
conferences
he
had
overheard
a
conversation
between
the
division
superintendent
and
the
head
of
the
railroad
detective
force
that
was
certainly
not
intended
for
his
ears
according
to
macvightie
a
man
by
the
name
of
birks
the
sharpest
man
in
the
united
states
secret
service
had
been
detailed
by
the
washington
authorities
to
the
case
macvightie
had
even
taken
a
generous
share
of
the
credit
for
this
move
to
himself
thefts
there
might
be
until
the
country
rang
with
them
murders
might
add
their
quota
to
the
reign
of
terror
yet
all
this
was
outside
the
province
of
the
secret
service
it
was
so
macvightie
had
said
through
macvightie
insistence
that
the
systematised
thefts
and
murders
were
inseparable
with
the
counterfeit
notes
then
flooding
the
country
that
had
induced
washington
to
act
the
hawk
and
his
gang
according
to
macvightie
again
were
at
the
bottom
of
both
one
and
the
counterfeiting
was
very
pertinently
within
the
province
of
the
secret
service
the
hawk
permitted
a
twisted
smile
to
flicker
across
his
lips
macvightie
the
police
in
general
and
birks
of
the
secret
service
in
particular
might
be
classed
as
complications
even
decidedly
awkward
complications
but
his
immediate
peril
lay
not
in
that
direction
but
from
those
whose
leadership
macvightie
so
blandly
credited
hawk
the
smile
twisted
one
of
grim
irony
while
macvightie
placarded
the
country
with
circulars
offering
rewards
for
the
capture
of
the
hawk
and
his
gang
the
gang
was
moving
heaven
and
earth
to
capture
the
hawk
for
its
own
exclusive
purposes
in
a
word
were
an
intense
desire
to
recover
the
proceeds
of
the
robberies
that
he
the
hawk
had
filched
from
under
the
gang
nose
and
thereafter
with
such
finality
as
might
be
afforded
by
a
blackjack
a
knife
thrust
or
a
revolver
bullet
to
expedite
the
hawk
departure
from
this
vale
of
tears
the
hawk
hand
curled
suddenly
into
a
clenched
fist
and
his
face
grew
set
he
was
he
had
little
enough
warrant
for
facetiousness
they
had
already
shown
their
teeth
they
had
shown
the
grim
ugly
deadliness
of
their
challenge
in
the
thrust
with
which
they
had
opened
their
attack
upon
him
he
had
parried
the
thrust
it
was
there
would
be
another
there
was
something
of
remorseless
promise
that
would
stop
at
nothing
in
the
extravagantly
laid
plans
with
which
they
had
just
attempted
to
lure
him
into
the
open
and
trap
him
they
had
failed
it
was
true
and
he
had
even
scored
against
them
their
cunning
their
power
their
resources
their
malignity
remained
unimpaired
they
would
try
again
it
was
like
two
adversaries
in
a
dark
room
each
conscious
of
the
presence
each
striving
to
place
the
other
each
conscious
that
the
death
of
one
was
life
for
the
other
that
was
the
pith
of
the
situation
the
hawk
teeth
clamped
together
it
was
quite
certain
that
they
would
run
him
to
he
were
first
at
the
same
game
an
organisation
as
widespread
as
the
one
against
which
he
had
elected
to
pit
his
wits
and
play
a
lone
hand
an
organisation
clever
enough
to
have
seized
and
put
to
its
own
use
the
entire
divisional
telegraph
system
of
a
railroad
an
organisation
callous
enough
to
have
counted
a
score
of
murders
but
incidents
in
its
schemes
and
above
all
an
organisation
guided
by
an
unknown
brain
that
was
a
master
of
cunning
and
unhampered
by
scruples
was
an
antagonist
as
sinister
as
it
was
powerful
for
days
now
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
he
the
hawk
had
turned
their
plans
to
his
own
account
skimmed
as
it
were
the
cream
from
their
there
could
be
but
one
answer
and
they
had
in
the
opening
attack
they
had
just
launched
against
him
it
was
obvious
enough
that
every
resource
at
their
command
was
to
be
thrown
into
the
balance
to
settle
scores
with
him
they
might
and
did
laugh
at
the
police
but
to
have
their
prizes
pocketed
and
carried
off
by
a
competitor
admitted
of
but
one
annihilation
of
the
competitor
the
hawk
rose
abruptly
from
his
seat
stepped
over
to
the
trunk
opened
it
and
in
an
instant
had
removed
the
secret
tray
from
the
curvature
of
the
lid
he
laid
the
tray
down
upon
the
table
and
his
fingers
brushing
aside
a
certain
magnificent
diamond
necklace
whose
thousand
facets
glittered
in
the
light
delved
swiftly
in
amongst
pile
after
pile
of
banknotes
and
secured
a
package
of
papers
he
pushed
the
tray
to
one
side
sat
down
again
at
the
table
removed
the
elastic
band
from
the
package
and
began
to
examine
the
papers
it
was
not
the
first
time
he
had
done
did
it
again
now
in
a
sort
of
desperation
and
simply
because
it
presented
the
one
possibility
at
which
he
might
grasp
in
the
hope
of
obtaining
a
clue
there
were
many
papers
here
loose
sheets
documents
in
envelopes
and
careful
as
he
had
been
before
there
was
a
chance
that
he
had
missed
the
one
a
sentence
in
perhaps
only
a
word
or
a
pencilled
the
back
of
an
would
save
him
from
disaster
now
it
was
the
night
before
last
that
parson
joe
with
his
fake
tube
of
radium
had
headed
the
gang
in
the
attempt
upon
his
the
hawk
life
the
twisted
smile
returned
to
the
hawk
lips
as
he
turned
first
one
paper
and
then
another
over
in
his
hands
he
had
been
fool
enough
to
imagine
that
besides
failure
they
had
left
a
and
clearly
defined
trail
behind
the
shape
of
that
very
comfortably
very
cosily
furnished
house
just
on
the
outskirts
of
the
city
where
the
butcher
had
proposed
to
play
the
rôle
of
spider
to
his
the
hawk
rôle
of
fly
it
had
even
seemed
a
childishly
simple
matter
to
pick
up
such
a
thread
and
follow
it
a
house
was
neither
rented
nor
furnished
out
of
thin
air
but
the
next
morning
the
house
was
closed
and
deserted
it
had
been
the
subtenant
whose
name
was
of
no
consequence
since
it
was
of
course
assumed
had
was
all
as
far
as
the
gang
was
concerned
the
house
had
lost
its
usefulness
and
having
lost
its
usefulness
had
simply
been
evacuated
and
together
with
the
furniture
left
to
its
own
resources
and
it
had
been
the
same
on
a
previous
occasion
with
isaac
kirschell
office
the
morning
after
he
the
hawk
had
appropriated
the
contents
of
kirschell
cash
box
and
had
recognised
kirschell
as
one
of
the
gang
the
suite
of
rooms
in
the
office
building
had
been
vacant
the
hawk
withdrew
the
last
paper
in
the
pile
from
its
envelope
and
read
it
with
a
sort
of
miserable
realisation
that
its
perusal
like
the
others
was
foredoomed
to
futility
it
was
an
alleged
mortgage
spurious
of
course
for
these
were
kirschell
papers
that
had
been
in
the
cash
box
and
in
the
very
nature
of
things
business
had
been
only
a
blind
to
cover
a
sort
of
branch
headquarters
for
the
gang
he
read
it
through
however
for
his
pains
the
printed
words
in
their
precise
legal
phraseology
seemed
to
mock
at
him
and
chuckle
with
devilishly
perverted
humour
he
tossed
the
document
upon
the
table
and
his
face
strained
pushed
back
his
chair
got
up
and
began
to
pace
the
length
of
the
room
with
a
tread
that
in
its
quick
nervous
litheness
and
its
silence
was
like
the
pacing
of
a
panther
in
its
cage
nothing
and
yet
there
must
be
it
was
his
move
now
and
there
was
little
time
to
spare
it
had
become
simply
a
question
of
which
of
the
two
he
or
the
gang
would
win
this
game
of
it
no
longer
sufficed
that
he
should
intercept
those
secret
code
messages
in
the
former
haphazard
way
for
consistently
as
he
had
haunted
the
telegraph
sounders
he
was
well
enough
aware
that
he
must
of
necessity
have
missed
many
of
the
messages
he
could
afford
to
miss
none
of
them
now
formerly
a
message
missed
meant
but
a
lost
opportunity
to
thwart
their
plans
to
add
a
little
more
to
the
contents
of
the
trunk
false
lid
now
since
they
had
shown
that
they
would
stop
at
nothing
to
trap
him
his
life
was
dependent
on
having
with
certainty
foreknowledge
of
their
every
plan
his
defense
lay
in
attack
he
must
trace
those
messages
to
their
source
and
trace
them
quickly
before
the
wire
devils
should
strike
again
or
leave
the
field
to
the
wire
other
words
quit
and
run
for
it
quit
it
was
the
first
sound
the
hawk
had
made
and
it
was
only
a
the
whisper
was
gritted
out
through
set
teeth
quit
he
laughed
a
little
low
with
menace
without
mirth
it
was
not
an
was
the
sting
of
a
curling
to
spur
him
on
well
what
was
he
to
do
then
it
was
his
there
was
no
time
to
spare
he
approached
the
table
again
and
began
to
rearrange
the
papers
into
a
pile
preparatory
to
replacing
them
in
the
tray
it
was
veritably
a
game
of
they
knew
him
through
personal
contact
but
only
as
a
man
who
had
always
been
masked
he
knew
many
of
them
and
knew
them
only
in
the
of
their
schemes
when
he
had
as
it
were
snatched
the
plunder
from
their
hands
as
he
made
his
own
escape
had
he
ever
seen
any
of
them
question
came
again
more
insistent
more
imperative
more
his
life
was
in
the
balance
what
was
he
to
do
go
out
again
and
haunt
a
telegraph
sounder
trust
he
turned
suddenly
the
spurious
mortgage
and
the
long
envelope
that
had
contained
it
in
his
hand
the
document
for
some
reason
or
other
refused
to
fit
into
the
envelope
as
neatly
or
as
readily
as
it
had
previously
done
he
held
the
envelope
up
to
the
the
next
instant
flinging
the
document
down
on
the
table
he
had
ripped
the
envelope
apart
and
from
under
the
inner
flap
where
it
had
undoubtedly
been
forced
by
the
document
itself
and
afterwards
as
he
had
handled
the
envelope
had
obviously
worked
its
way
partially
out
again
he
extracted
a
small
thin
slip
of
yellow
paper
and
then
for
a
moment
the
hawk
stood
motionless
but
into
the
dark
eyes
there
leaped
a
triumphant
flash
in
his
hand
was
the
return
portion
of
a
railroad
ticket
that
read
conmore
to
selkirk
city
he
whipped
the
ticket
over
to
scrutinise
the
date
stamp
on
the
was
that
of
the
day
prior
to
his
visit
to
kirschell
office
and
he
laughed
a
little
again
but
there
was
no
bitterness
in
the
laugh
now
the
clue
that
he
had
sought
the
clue
that
lanson
men
had
in
vain
patrolled
and
scoured
the
division
right
of
way
to
obtain
was
in
his
possession
it
a
glove
muttered
the
hawk
with
grim
complacence
kirschell
had
the
envelope
in
his
pocket
of
course
and
in
putting
his
return
ticket
in
his
pocket
it
slipped
into
the
envelope
without
his
knowing
it
got
crowded
under
the
flap
and
he
thought
he
had
lost
it
the
hawk
turned
sharply
to
the
table
he
was
working
with
feverish
haste
now
replacing
the
papers
in
the
tray
and
fitting
the
tray
back
into
the
curvature
of
the
trunk
lid
number
if
she
on
time
is
due
at
he
pulled
out
his
watch
the
light
was
out
the
door
locked
behind
him
that
east
of
here
and
between
here
and
bald
he
was
out
of
the
house
now
and
running
along
the
lane
that
gave
on
the
station
street
yes
said
the
hawk
again
and
there
was
suppressed
elation
in
his
voice
it
fits
it
a
glove
the
hawk
reached
the
station
and
purchased
a
ticket
but
as
usual
the
ticket
did
not
indicate
his
read
not
to
conmore
but
to
several
stations
farther
along
the
line
the
local
pulled
in
on
time
as
it
pulled
out
again
the
hawk
having
appropriated
the
rear
seat
of
the
smoker
lighted
though
he
inclined
little
toward
that
particular
form
of
tobacco
a
cigar
his
slouch
hat
was
jerked
a
little
forward
over
his
eyes
he
settled
back
in
his
seat
like
links
in
a
chain
the
keen
alert
brain
was
welding
the
events
of
the
days
gone
by
into
a
concrete
whole
the
headquarters
of
the
gang
the
heart
of
the
web
from
which
the
wire
devils
operated
was
logically
as
he
had
known
as
macvightie
had
known
outside
the
city
where
the
telegraph
line
could
be
tapped
without
observation
and
at
will
macvightie
initial
and
only
attempt
to
ground
out
the
tap
had
indicated
that
the
wire
was
being
tampered
with
between
selkirk
and
bald
creek
conmore
was
between
selkirk
and
bald
creek
and
what
interest
could
kirschell
a
new
york
crook
have
in
a
place
like
conmore
that
was
little
more
than
a
hamlet
what
then
had
prompted
kirschell
trip
to
conmore
and
return
the
hawk
smiled
whimsically
it
was
not
proof
absolute
but
in
his
own
mind
it
was
proof
quite
sufficient
kirschell
visit
to
conmore
had
been
a
visit
to
the
headquarters
of
the
gang
also
material
proof
apart
he
sensed
intuitively
that
he
had
struck
the
right
trail
those
messages
keeping
the
unknown
brain
that
schemed
and
plotted
each
move
in
instant
touch
with
every
unit
of
the
widespread
organisation
making
it
possible
for
them
to
strike
at
a
moment
warning
at
any
point
over
a
hundred
miles
of
country
conmore
the
train
stopped
at
a
station
and
went
on
again
the
hawk
nursed
his
cigar
sedulously
and
stared
out
of
the
window
twenty
minutes
went
by
and
then
the
train
stopped
conmore
the
hawk
did
not
move
save
that
his
eyes
rested
casually
on
a
passenger
who
was
making
a
hurried
and
belated
dash
for
the
door
it
was
quite
possible
that
the
man
was
not
one
of
the
gang
and
equally
possible
that
the
man
the
hawk
did
not
recognise
the
other
but
he
would
do
the
wire
devils
less
than
justice
to
credit
them
with
lack
of
interest
in
passengers
for
in
any
occupant
of
any
car
who
might
have
left
his
seat
and
found
the
platform
attractive
say
just
before
conmore
was
reached
if
the
man
was
a
spy
hawk
smiled
at
his
now
man
would
have
little
to
report
the
train
jerked
forward
into
motion
again
the
station
was
on
the
same
side
as
the
hawk
hawk
did
not
look
out
of
the
window
but
he
was
far
from
being
oblivious
to
the
fact
that
no
platform
lights
had
shown
through
the
car
windows
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
aisle
the
speed
increased
a
little
but
still
the
hawk
did
not
stir
the
train
rattled
over
the
siding
switch
of
the
conmore
yard
and
then
the
hawk
rose
languidly
tossed
his
cigar
butt
into
the
cuspidor
brushed
a
very
noticeable
quantity
of
cigar
ash
from
his
vest
paused
for
a
drink
at
the
and
as
though
his
smoke
finished
he
was
seeking
the
clearer
atmosphere
of
a
rear
car
opened
the
door
and
stepped
out
on
the
platform
the
hawk
dropped
to
the
right
of
way
from
the
side
of
the
train
opposite
to
that
of
the
station
landed
as
as
a
cat
flung
himself
instantly
flat
down
at
the
edge
of
the
embankment
and
lay
still
the
local
racketed
its
way
red
winked
and
there
fell
a
silence
a
drowsy
night
silence
broken
only
by
the
chirp
of
insects
and
the
mutter
of
the
receding
train
the
hawk
raised
his
head
and
looked
about
him
a
few
hundred
yards
away
glinted
the
station
semaphore
and
window
lights
the
siding
switch
light
nearer
showed
green
like
a
huge
glowing
emerald
in
the
black
there
was
nothing
else
there
was
no
sign
of
little
hamlet
lay
hidden
in
a
hollow
a
mile
away
on
the
station
side
of
the
track
ladybird
the
hawk
rose
and
began
to
move
forward
conmore
was
certainly
an
idealistic
the
wire
devils
standpoint
he
frowned
a
little
there
was
no
doubt
in
his
mind
but
that
in
a
general
way
he
had
solved
the
problem
that
somewhere
in
this
vicinity
the
right
of
way
held
the
wire
tappers
secret
but
as
he
was
well
aware
his
difficulties
were
far
from
at
an
end
and
that
particular
spot
might
be
anywhere
within
several
miles
of
conmore
and
it
might
with
equal
reason
be
east
or
west
of
the
station
and
then
the
hawk
shrugged
his
shoulders
the
night
was
early
yet
early
enough
to
enable
him
to
cover
several
miles
of
track
on
both
sides
of
the
station
if
necessary
before
daylight
came
if
he
had
luck
with
him
he
was
on
the
right
side
now
if
not
then
by
midnight
he
would
start
in
on
the
other
it
required
the
exercise
of
a
little
philosophical
patience
nothing
more
it
was
black
along
the
black
night
no
moon
no
stars
and
it
was
silent
a
half
hour
passed
like
a
shadow
and
as
silent
as
one
the
hawk
moved
telegraph
pole
to
telegraph
pole
a
pin
point
of
light
showed
far
down
the
right
of
way
grew
larger
brighter
more
the
refuge
crouched
beneath
a
culvert
as
a
big
and
its
string
of
coaches
trucks
beating
at
the
fishplates
quick
like
the
tattoo
of
a
snare
drum
roared
by
over
his
head
still
another
half
hour
passed
it
was
slow
work
he
was
perhaps
at
most
a
mile
and
a
half
from
the
conmore
station
and
then
suddenly
the
hawk
dropped
to
his
hands
and
knees
and
crawled
down
the
embankment
and
lay
flat
and
motionless
in
the
almost
inaudible
a
footstep
had
crunched
on
the
gravel
of
the
roadbed
ahead
of
him
the
hawk
only
movement
now
was
the
tightening
of
his
fingers
around
the
stock
of
his
automatic
as
out
of
the
blackness
a
blacker
shape
loomed
up
and
a
man
sauntered
by
along
the
track
the
hawk
lips
compressed
into
a
grim
smile
his
caution
had
not
been
exaggerated
the
wire
devils
guard
luck
at
least
initial
luck
was
with
him
then
the
tap
was
here
east
of
the
station
and
at
the
next
pole
probably
but
it
was
more
than
likely
that
there
was
another
guard
patrolling
on
the
other
side
they
would
certainly
take
no
chances
either
of
surprise
or
of
being
unable
to
dismantle
their
apparatus
instantly
at
the
first
it
would
almost
necessarily
require
more
than
one
man
for
that
he
crept
forward
again
and
again
lay
still
the
man
on
the
track
close
to
the
telegraph
pole
now
two
blurred
shapes
showed
and
then
low
there
came
voices
and
a
laugh
but
now
the
hawk
was
wriggling
swiftly
away
from
the
track
there
was
no
longer
any
need
to
examine
the
telegraph
sense
of
touch
guiding
him
he
was
following
an
insulated
wire
two
wires
that
lay
along
the
ground
and
following
these
wires
he
reached
the
fence
that
enclosed
the
right
of
way
worked
his
way
through
and
here
paused
the
wires
had
apparently
disappeared
abruptly
into
the
ground
for
perhaps
a
minute
the
hawk
lay
still
save
that
his
fingers
worked
and
dug
at
loose
earth
and
then
his
coat
extended
on
either
side
of
him
he
raised
himself
an
inch
or
two
from
the
ground
and
beneath
his
body
his
tiny
flashlight
glowed
for
a
brief
instant
and
was
restored
to
his
pocket
the
hawk
began
to
crawl
forward
again
he
was
on
the
edge
of
a
ploughed
piece
of
farm
land
it
was
all
very
simple
and
it
was
very
clear
now
in
the
loose
earth
there
was
embedded
a
small
rough
wooden
box
in
this
receptacle
was
a
junction
box
and
from
the
junction
box
through
holes
bored
in
the
outer
wooden
casing
the
wires
continued
on
into
a
small
flexible
conduit
the
hawk
smiled
grimly
lanson
and
lanson
section
men
might
search
a
thousand
years
and
never
solve
the
problem
the
wire
devils
were
not
limited
to
any
one
single
or
particular
telegraph
pole
they
were
limited
only
in
the
radius
of
their
operations
by
the
length
of
the
tap
wires
they
used
they
had
only
to
tap
the
line
run
their
tap
back
brush
the
loose
earth
away
from
the
top
of
the
wooden
casing
open
the
latter
connect
with
the
junction
box
and
their
tap
became
an
integral
part
of
the
railroad
telegraph
system
it
was
very
simple
when
they
were
not
reversed
the
process
they
disconnected
from
the
main
line
coiled
their
tap
wires
up
hid
them
in
the
wooden
casing
restored
the
loose
earth
over
the
latter
surface
and
save
for
one
of
those
thousands
of
splices
on
the
main
line
incident
to
years
of
service
and
differing
in
no
way
from
any
of
its
fellows
no
sign
or
vestige
of
their
work
remained
it
required
of
course
a
outfit
and
the
necessary
appliances
for
work
at
the
top
of
the
telegraph
that
the
wire
devils
were
adequately
equipped
in
this
respect
was
so
obvious
as
to
make
any
consideration
of
that
detail
absurd
for
the
rest
the
little
conduit
laid
in
a
ploughed
furrow
with
the
earth
spread
back
over
it
completed
in
perfection
and
simplicity
the
unholy
little
scheme
on
the
hawk
crawled
across
the
field
all
this
premised
a
house
a
farm
house
probably
in
the
immediate
vicinity
the
ploughed
field
must
of
course
never
be
disturbed
therefore
the
tenancy
of
the
land
axiomatically
was
for
the
moment
vested
in
the
wire
devils
the
hawk
far
enough
from
the
railroad
now
to
be
secure
from
observation
had
risen
from
his
hands
and
knees
and
in
a
crouched
position
was
moving
forward
more
rapidly
a
small
wooded
tract
of
land
was
showing
a
little
way
in
front
of
him
the
house
undoubtedly
was
there
he
gained
the
trees
made
his
way
through
what
appeared
to
be
an
open
grove
of
pines
and
on
the
other
side
at
the
edge
of
the
clearing
halted
and
listened
intently
he
could
just
make
out
a
little
group
of
house
itself
a
barn
and
one
or
two
smaller
structures
probably
wagon
and
implement
sheds
no
light
showed
from
anywhere
nor
was
there
any
sound
cautiously
silently
the
hawk
crossed
the
clearing
and
began
to
circuit
the
house
it
was
a
little
strange
the
place
seemed
absolutely
deserted
had
he
made
a
mistake
naturally
he
could
not
follow
the
direction
of
the
buried
conduit
was
there
another
house
in
the
neighbourhood
he
shook
his
head
there
might
be
another
house
many
of
them
for
that
matter
but
the
ploughed
field
from
its
location
surely
belonged
to
this
one
and
halted
once
more
and
listening
again
intently
looked
sharply
about
him
he
was
around
on
the
other
side
of
the
house
now
and
now
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
one
of
the
lower
windows
it
was
not
the
window
of
a
lighted
room
yet
still
a
faint
glow
seemed
to
emanate
most
curiously
from
it
he
crept
toward
it
crouched
beneath
it
listened
again
then
partially
straightening
window
sill
was
but
breast
in
of
the
room
itself
he
could
see
the
dull
glow
of
light
extremely
faint
that
came
he
now
discovered
from
an
open
door
across
the
room
he
tried
the
window
and
then
finding
the
catch
unfastened
with
a
deft
pressure
of
his
fingers
upon
the
sash
he
began
to
raise
it
slowly
silently
and
now
into
the
hawk
dark
eyes
there
leaped
for
the
second
time
that
night
a
triumphant
flash
yes
beyond
doubt
beyond
question
beyond
cavil
here
was
the
heart
of
the
spider
web
at
last
muffled
low
indistinct
barely
audible
but
equally
unmistakable
there
came
the
clicking
of
a
telegraph
instrument
the
hawk
drew
his
mask
from
his
pocket
slipped
it
over
his
face
swung
noiselessly
over
the
window
sill
and
began
to
creep
across
the
room
toward
the
opened
door
and
the
glow
of
light
and
as
the
clicking
of
the
sounder
grew
more
distinct
and
there
mingled
with
it
now
a
murmur
of
voices
the
hawk
lips
compressed
into
a
thin
straight
line
if
he
were
caught
if
a
single
inadvertent
sound
betrayed
his
presence
it
needed
no
effort
of
the
imagination
to
picture
what
would
follow
death
if
it
were
sudden
would
be
a
very
merciful
it
would
not
be
death
if
the
wire
devils
could
prevent
it
until
they
had
exhausted
every
means
torture
ingenious
and
devilish
for
instance
to
extort
from
him
the
whereabouts
of
the
plunder
taken
from
them
and
which
they
knew
to
be
in
his
possession
he
knew
much
now
he
knew
their
lair
at
last
and
for
a
moment
as
these
thoughts
flashed
across
his
mind
he
was
prompted
to
retreat
again
while
he
had
the
chance
an
inner
voice
called
him
a
fool
to
persist
another
bade
him
go
on
but
the
latter
voice
was
right
he
knew
he
did
not
know
enough
if
his
life
was
in
peril
in
the
one
sense
it
was
equally
in
peril
in
the
other
he
did
not
know
enough
who
for
instance
was
the
master
brain
behind
the
organisation
where
and
how
for
instance
was
the
next
trap
they
would
set
for
him
to
be
laid
brief
snatches
of
conversation
now
began
to
reach
the
hawk
as
he
drew
nearer
to
the
door
thousand
dollars
traders
national
bank
superintendent
car
dummy
package
counterfeit
seals
all
right
but
macvightie
says
the
secret
service
is
sending
a
man
by
the
name
of
birks
out
here
and
then
a
voice
at
which
the
hawk
involuntarily
held
his
breath
and
to
which
at
the
door
now
he
listened
in
a
sort
of
stunned
incredulity
as
though
he
were
indeed
the
sport
of
his
own
ears
it
was
a
very
quiet
voice
very
soft
a
velvet
voice
a
voice
whose
tones
were
cultured
whose
language
was
the
language
of
a
pirate
of
the
spanish
main
time
enough
to
attend
to
this
birks
i
want
is
the
hawk
came
in
limpid
tones
and
if
i
were
not
tied
down
here
in
this
damned
and
wheel
chair
i
would
have
twisted
his
throat
for
him
long
ago
i
furnish
i
am
cursed
with
a
miserable
crawling
mob
of
gnats
upon
whom
they
are
wasted
that
if
shown
the
light
knows
nothing
but
to
singe
its
own
wings
the
voice
was
not
raised
it
was
like
a
mother
like
a
woman
voice
talking
plaintively
to
a
spoiled
there
was
something
absolutely
deadly
in
its
inflection
the
ladybird
the
hawk
lips
framed
the
words
without
sound
and
in
a
sort
of
numbed
hesitant
way
thought
he
was
the
telegraph
sounder
kept
on
spluttering
at
intervals
but
it
was
only
stray
stuff
routine
railroad
business
going
over
the
wires
the
hawk
flat
on
the
floor
and
at
one
side
of
the
jamb
now
stared
through
the
doorway
it
was
the
doorway
leading
to
the
cellar
the
stairs
halfway
down
turned
abruptly
at
right
angles
the
hawk
was
rewarded
with
a
view
of
the
stone
foundation
wall
of
the
house
nothing
more
but
for
the
moment
the
hawk
was
lost
to
his
immediate
surroundings
the
criminal
acquaintanceship
was
wide
varied
and
intimate
and
his
mind
was
still
not
entirely
recovered
from
the
startled
amazement
which
the
recognition
of
that
voice
had
brought
him
he
was
quite
fully
conversant
with
the
ladybird
he
had
thought
the
ladybird
dead
the
ladybird
was
not
an
ordinary
criminal
instead
of
having
spent
twenty
years
in
sing
sing
as
was
very
justly
his
due
the
police
had
spent
those
twenty
years
in
trying
to
put
him
the
ladybird
was
still
to
know
the
restrictions
of
a
cage
clever
fearless
cunning
napoleonic
in
the
scope
and
breadth
of
his
operations
the
biggest
scoops
on
the
blotters
of
the
new
york
police
and
higher
up
on
the
federal
records
were
laid
to
the
ladybird
door
but
always
somewhere
the
thread
of
evidence
not
till
the
door
itself
was
always
it
broke
the
thread
had
never
crossed
the
threshold
the
man
himself
was
highly
educated
a
man
now
well
on
toward
fifty
in
the
underworld
there
were
a
thousand
different
stories
of
his
early
he
had
been
a
professor
of
science
in
a
great
university
that
he
came
of
a
rich
family
high
up
in
the
social
scale
that
he
had
been
in
fact
everything
that
the
spice
of
imagination
could
supply
to
enhance
the
glamour
that
surrounded
him
in
the
sordid
empire
of
crimeland
where
so
many
were
his
followers
and
worshippers
but
here
too
the
thread
was
broken
none
knew
who
he
had
been
none
knew
where
he
had
come
from
they
knew
him
only
as
one
who
was
invulnerable
against
the
attacks
and
efforts
of
the
police
as
a
peer
of
their
own
unholy
realm
as
one
whose
name
was
a
name
to
conjure
in
the
name
the
moniker
they
themselves
had
given
the
ladybird
on
account
of
his
effeminate
voice
and
manner
derision
was
neither
intended
nor
implied
there
were
limits
and
bounds
to
even
the
underworld
temerity
and
none
knew
better
than
the
underworld
the
sinister
incongruity
of
those
effeminate
characteristics
where
another
might
bellow
and
roar
his
rage
and
threaten
the
ladybird
lisped
his
struck
but
he
the
hawk
had
thought
the
ladybird
dead
the
man
had
been
badly
hurt
a
year
ago
in
a
railroad
accident
somewhere
in
the
east
and
the
report
had
spread
and
had
been
credited
even
in
the
inner
circles
of
the
underworld
that
he
was
dead
the
hawk
lips
twisted
grimly
the
ladybird
had
seen
to
it
evidently
that
the
report
was
not
denied
and
so
instead
the
man
was
a
cripple
now
weaving
his
plots
and
scheming
with
that
black
cunning
brain
of
his
from
a
wheel
chair
well
the
hawk
reached
quickly
into
his
pocket
for
pencil
and
would
be
just
light
enough
to
enable
him
to
see
the
sounder
was
rattling
a
brisk
tattoo
but
it
was
no
longer
stray
stuff
the
message
in
quick
sure
sending
was
coming
in
the
wire
devils
secret
code
letter
by
letter
the
hawk
jotted
it
down

the
sounder
ceased
abruptly
there
was
silence
the
hawk
replaced
pencil
and
paper
in
his
pocket
the
minutes
message
was
evidently
being
decoded
then
the
ladybird
voice
very
well
code
a
message
to
number
one
and
tell
him
number
seven
has
completed
his
work
tell
him
again
to
take
no
chances
by
hurrying
things
that
he
is
to
wait
until
they
are
asleep
and
warn
him
again
that
under
no
circumstances
is
our
hand
to
show
in
this
a
slight
confusion
followed
from
fling
of
feet
the
murmur
of
voices
mingling
with
curious
indefinable
metallic
sounds
and
then
suddenly
the
ladybird
voice
again
mind
that
message
damn
my
cursed
useless
legs
a
flow
of
unbridled
oaths
sacrilege
the
more
horrible
the
menace
the
more
ghastly
for
the
languid
conversational
tones
in
which
the
blasphemy
rolled
so
smoothly
from
the
man
lips
i
trust
to
no
message
tonight
curse
my
legs
if
i
could
only
get
there
myself
failure
failure
failure
gnats
but
i
will
not
have
my
plans
ruined
by
any
fool
here
you
dixer
where
dixer
i
here
a
voice
answered
listen
them
murmured
the
ladybird
you
have
got
any
more
brains
than
any
of
the
rest
of
them
but
you
so
cautious
you
would
take
a
chance
on
swapping
a
mexican
dollar
for
a
gold
eagle
unless
you
had
a
bottle
of
acid
in
your
fear
the
eagle
was
bad
i
want
caution
tonight
and
i
want
orders
obeyed
to
the
letter
and
that
all
i
want
you
take
the
runabout
and
go
down
there
lots
of
time
tell
number
one
you
in
charge
i
wire
him
to
that
effect
and
now
pay
attention
to
me
so
you
wo
have
ignorance
for
an
excuse
it
time
the
police
and
the
rags
they
call
newspapers
around
here
had
a
little
something
to
divert
their
us
they
getting
to
be
pests
and
i
want
a
lull
in
which
to
devote
a
little
more
attention
hawk
it
about
time
they
understood
we
are
modest
enough
not
to
hog
all
the
he
laughed
a
little
a
low
modulated
dulcet
laugh
that
rippled
like
a
in
the
ripple
there
was
something
that
was
akin
to
a
shudder
twice
in
the
last
month
the
traders
national
has
made
remittances
to
its
banking
correspondent
at
elkhead
for
the
mine
country
pay
rolls
and
on
account
of
general
business
they
did
it
very
neatly
they
fooled
us
the
remittances
were
only
piker
amounts
and
because
it
was
only
a
question
of
letting
them
get
fed
up
enough
with
their
own
cleverness
to
pull
a
good
one
they
pulling
a
good
one
the
ladybird
laugh
rippled
out
again
to
outwit
us
and
paying
us
the
compliment
of
not
daring
to
trust
to
ordinary
means
of
shipment
they
had
a
little
arrangement
in
force
with
lanson
the
division
superintendent
it
was
very
simple
lanson
in
his
car
making
a
trip
over
the
division
could
never
interest
not
why
should
it
only
they
did
not
count
on
number
eleven
inside
the
bank
very
well
they
wrapped
their
banknotes
up
in
small
packages
sealed
them
with
the
bank
seal
wrapped
these
small
packages
up
again
into
an
innocent
looking
parcel
without
a
seal
and
handed
it
over
to
a
trusted
young
employé
by
the
name
of
meridan
on
both
the
former
occasions
meridan
left
the
bank
at
the
usual
closing
hour
took
the
parcel
with
him
and
went
home
but
later
on
in
the
evening
he
slipped
down
to
the
railroad
yard
boarded
lanson
private
car
locked
the
parcel
up
in
a
small
cupboard
at
the
bottom
of
the
bookcase
with
which
the
main
compartment
of
the
car
is
equipped
smoked
a
cigar
with
lanson
turned
in
the
car
was
coupled
to
the
night
express
and
in
the
morning
meridan
delivered
his
package
in
elkhead
that
was
the
way
it
was
done
before
dixer
voice
if
anything
grew
and
that
the
way
it
is
being
done
this
there
are
more
little
sealed
packages
in
the
parcel
and
meridan
will
sneak
out
of
his
home
again
and
go
down
to
the
private
car
with
the
money
as
usual
your
way
yours
and
the
butcher
and
that
of
the
rest
of
you
would
be
to
lay
a
blackjack
over
meridan
head
on
the
way
to
the
railroad
yard
and
snatch
the
parcel
it
not
my
way
it
too
hot
as
it
is
around
here
now
and
there
got
to
be
a
big
enough
noise
made
to
attract
attention
to
the
other
side
of
the
fence
and
give
us
a
breathing
spell
paul
meridan
stands
for
this
there
nothing
new
about
one
of
those
ubiquitous
employés
going
wrong
but
everybody
sucks
in
their
breaths
just
the
same
every
time
it
happens
and
the
splash
is
always
just
as
big
understand
number
one
has
got
a
dummy
package
identical
in
appearance
with
of
the
small
packages
is
sealed
with
the
bank
seal
in
wax
and
the
whole
is
wrapped
up
with
the
bank
special
wrapping
paper
and
tied
precisely
as
is
the
one
meridan
has
in
his
possession
number
eleven
did
his
work
well
there
was
of
course
no
opportunity
to
effect
the
exchange
in
the
bank
itself
and
the
dummy
parcel
had
to
be
made
up
outside
but
there
was
no
difficulty
in
carrying
away
enough
wrapping
paper
and
wax
for
the
as
far
as
the
seal
was
concerned
it
was
you
dixer
who
engraved
it
a
week
ago
was
it
yes
said
dixer
you
took
me
off
the
new
plate
for
exactly
lisped
the
ladybird
well
though
this
exchange
could
not
be
effected
in
the
bank
there
was
no
great
ingenuity
required
to
get
meridan
to
handle
perhaps
only
to
lift
say
a
pile
of
the
wrapping
paper
from
one
position
on
a
table
or
desk
to
another
if
the
under
sheet
happened
to
be
slightly
smeared
and
so
left
a
not
too
evident
but
still
finger
print
it
was
i
am
afraid
our
friend
meridan
great
misfortune
that
was
one
of
the
sheets
number
eleven
took
away
with
him
very
good
meridan
delivers
his
package
to
his
bank
correspondent
in
elkhead
morning
when
the
seals
are
broken
the
little
packages
are
found
to
of
blotting
paper
neatly
and
carefully
cut
to
the
size
of
banknotes
there
could
be
no
reason
for
suspecting
meridan
the
trusted
one
would
think
of
such
a
thing
he
had
simply
been
the
victim
of
a
clever
substitution
he
was
entirely
blameless
naturally
that
would
be
the
way
meridan
would
reason
and
that
would
be
the
way
they
would
figure
he
had
reasoned
when
they
read
the
letter
from
friend
that
we
are
sending
and
which
they
will
receive
in
the
morning
meridan
did
have
an
ample
opportunity
to
effect
the
substitution
himself
the
letter
simply
suggests
a
close
inspection
of
the
wrappers
for
finger
prints
and
directs
attention
to
apartment
b
on
the
ground
floor
of
the
rather
fashionable
abode
for
a
young
and
newly
married
bank
there
might
possibly
be
found
certain
articles
such
as
say
a
counterfeit
of
the
bank
seal
a
quantity
of
the
special
wax
and
some
superfluous
sheets
of
the
particular
wrapping
paper
there
was
utter
silence
from
the
cellar
below
for
an
instant
then
there
came
a
callous
guffaw
some
plant
all
right
applauded
a
voice
hoarsely
and
it
was
thousand
dollars
you
said
was
it
chief
again
that
rippling
laugh
soft
low
and
silvery
thousand
dollars
is
correct

now

if
you
fail
you

sometime
during

night
you
find
number
one
and
the
rest

in
the
old
freight
shed
near
the
roundhouse
the
hawk
was
wriggling
silently
back
across
the
floor
there
was
no
scheme
on
foot
that
was
aimed
at
him
there
was
instead
thousand
cash
he
gained
the
window
and
swung
to
the
sill
footsteps
hurried
sounded
from
the
direction
of
the
cellar
stairs
the
hawk
dropped
to
the
ground
stole
noiselessly
around
the
rear
of
the
house
and
reached
the
shelter
of
the
grove
of
trees
here
he
paused
slipped
his
mask
into
his
pocket
and
for
a
moment
a
look
of
puzzled
hesitation
was
in
his
face
then
running
again
but
making
a
wide
detour
to
avoid
the
guarded
section
of
the
track
he
headed
for
a
point
that
would
intercept
the
right
of
way
quite
close
to
the
conmore
station
and
as
he
ran
he
jerked
his
watch
and
flashlight
from
his
pockets
it
was
a
quarter
past
nine
it
was
early
yet
very
early
and
they
certainly
would
not
make
any
attempt
on
the
car
much
before
midnight
but
for
all
that
the
hawk
who
was
intimately
conversant
with
the
train
schedules
shook
his
head
impatiently
as
he
sped
were
twenty
miles
between
himself
and
selkirk
and
the
quickest
as
indeed
the
only
way
to
get
there
since
unlike
dixer
he
was
not
possessed
of
a
runabout
was
slow
at
best
there
were
no
westbound
passenger
trains
scheduling
conmore
for
two
hours
or
more
and
he
would
scarcely
have
dared
to
risk
boarding
one
at
the
station
if
there
had
remained
then
not
by
choice
but
by
necessity
the
way
freight
the
way
freight
made
conmore
at
about
ten
and
selkirk
at
about
it
would
serve
admirably
of
course
shook
his
head
again
and
then
laughed
shortly
there
were
no
ifs
would
be
a
passenger
on
the
way
freight
even
break
it
took
the
hawk
some
minutes
to
reach
the
spot
he
had
selected
as
his
objective
a
spot
some
fifty
yards
east
of
the
conmore
siding
switch
and
here
he
lay
down
in
the
grass
under
the
shelter
of
the
embankment
it
was
very
quiet
very
still
very
dark
there
was
nothing
in
sight
save
the
winking
station
lights
in
the
distance
and
the
siding
switch
light
nearer
at
hand
thousand
dollars
said
the
hawk
very
softly
to
himself
he
rolled
the
words
like
some
sweet
morsel
on
his
tongue
thousand
cash
the
hawk
spread
out
one
side
of
his
coat
and
under
its
protection
in
a
diminutive
but
steady
little
glow
of
light
the
tiny
flashlight
played
its
ray
upon
the
sheet
of
paper
across
which
he
had
scrawled
the
wire
devils
code
message
key
at
four
muttered
the
in
parallel
columns
set
down
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
one
column
transposed
it
took
the
hawk
much
longer
to
decode
the
message
than
it
had
taken
those
in
the
house
to
perform
the
same
task
the
hawk
was
working
under
difficulties
a
stone
none
too
flat
served
to
rest
his
paper
upon
and
he
had
only
two
hands
with
which
to
manipulate
pencil
flashlight
and
coat
at
the
expiration
of
perhaps
half
an
hour
the
result
of
his
work
looked
like
this
and
then
the
hawk
looked
throb
and
mutter
of
a
distant
train
was
in
the
air
pencil
paper
and
flashlight
were
restored
to
his
pockets
and
he
drew
further
back
from
the
right
of
way
far
down
the
track
the
way
freight
headlight
flashed
into
view
a
minute
passed
another
and
still
another
and
now
where
the
hawk
had
lain
the
ground
was
ablaze
with
black
again
there
was
the
roar
of
steam
a
grind
and
clash
and
shatter
ricochetting
down
the
string
of
cars
the
scream
and
shriek
of
and
then
a
panting
thing
as
though
the
big
mogul
were
drawing
in
deep
breaths
after
great
exertion
the
way
freight
came
to
a
standstill
a
few
yards
from
the
siding
switch
the
hawk
crept
forward
his
eyes
sweeping
down
the
length
of
the
train
in
a
keen
tense
gaze
there
was
a
flat
showed
in
a
curious
open
space
like
a
break
in
the
black
thread
stretched
along
the
it
was
too
far
away
and
too
perilously
close
to
the
caboose
his
eyes
travelled
back
and
being
nearer
to
the
train
now
he
discerned
a
boxcar
empty
its
door
open
almost
in
front
of
him
he
crawled
forward
until
he
was
abreast
of
it
and
until
he
lay
close
up
against
the
rails
looked
cautiously
up
and
down
the
length
of
the
train
sprang
to
his
feet
and
in
an
instant
lay
stretched
out
far
back
in
the
interior
of
the
car
the
train
moved
forward
stopped
again
at
the
station
and
again
moved
forward
the
hawk
reverted
to
his
pencil
paper
and
flashlight
the
code
message
now

room
it
was
now
simply
a
matter
of
grouping
the
letters
properly
and
the
hawk
wrote
out
the
message
at
the
bottom
of
the
sheet
seal
wax
and
paper
planted
behind
large
framed
picture
over
mantel
meridan

the
hawk
stared
at
it
grimly
said
the
hawk
i

the
job
is
wished
on
the
young
fellow
to
a
finish
he
would
have
a
hope
and
macvightie
would
never
look
any
the
hawk
was
silent
for
a
moment
thousand
cash
murmured
the
hawk
again
the
way
freight
ran
slowly
very
it
had
already
been
from
ten
to
fifteen
minutes
late
in
reaching
conmore
at
the
next
station
the
train
crew
seemed
possessed
of
a
perversity
infernal
for
shifting
shunting
and
lifting
cars
the
hawk
fuming
with
impatience
consulted
his
watch
as
they
finally
pulled
out
into
the
clear
again
it
was
minutes
of
eleven
the
train
rattled
bumped
and
jerked
its
way
at
the
remaining
intermediate
stations
there
was
more
delay
and
when
approaching
selkirk
at
last
the
hawk
consulted
his
watch
again
as
the
train
whistled
he
was
conscious
that
his
impatience
was
tempered
with
a
sort
of
sullen
philosophical
expectation
of
defeat
his
luck
had
been
too
abundant
during
the
early
part
of
the
evening
it
was
now
ten
minutes
of
twelve
he
leaned
out
of
the
doorway
peering
ahead
they
were
just
rolling
into
the
selkirk
yard
the
hawk
swung
himself
out
from
the
car
dropped
to
the
ground
darted
quickly
to
one
side
over
several
spur
tracks
and
stood
still
the
way
freight
like
a
snail
dragged
past
him
opening
as
it
were
a
panorama
of
the
scene
in
the
yard
the
low
switch
lights
red
green
purple
and
white
like
myriad
and
variegated
fireflies
hovering
everywhere
over
the
ground
the
bobbing
lantern
of
a
yardman
here
and
there
the
dancing
gleam
of
a
headlight
as
the
little
yard
engine
shot
fussily
away
from
a
string
of
lighted
eastern
it
had
evidently
just
made
up
and
backed
down
on
the
main
line
beside
the
station
while
to
his
right
up
the
yard
on
one
of
the
spurs
perhaps
a
hundred
yards
away
its
platform
showing
in
the
glow
of
the
dome
light
stood
the
superintendent
car
and
to
his
left
not
quite
so
far
up
the
yard
and
therefore
nearer
to
him
than
the
private
car
the
hawk
could
make
out
the
black
irregular
outline
of
the
old
freight
shed
the
yard
engine
wheezed
its
way
importantly
up
past
the
station
stopped
a
switch
light
winked
changed
colour
and
the
shunter
began
to
puff
its
way
back
the
hawk
shrugged
his
shoulders
resignedly
the
game
was
up
and
he
was
too
late
unless
dixer
had
been
forced
to
defer
his
attempt
until
some
time
during
the
run
that
night
which
was
hardly
likely
the
yard
engine
was
backing
down
now
to
take
the
superintendent
car
up
to
the
main
line
preparatory
to
running
it
back
and
coupling
it
to
the
string
of
coaches
beside
the
station
platform
the
hawk
smiled
in
the
darkness
without
mirth
as
he
lost
sight
of
the
little
switcher
on
the
other
side
of
the
private
car
well
at
least
he
could
gamble
on
the
one
chance
that
was
left
there
was
only
one
thing
to
over
to
the
station
and
get
a
pullman
berth
if
dixer
and
the
butcher
was
number
one
on
the
pullman
the
money
was
still
in
the
private
car
the
hawk
eyes
narrowed
suddenly
a
man
crouched
and
running
swiftly
circled
the
end
of
the
private
car
and
headed
in
the
direction
of
the
freight
like
a
flash
the
hawk
whirled
and
leaped
forward
running
silently
toward
the
same
goal
the
hawk
brain
stimulated
keen
alert
worked
with
lightning
speed
and
suddenly
a
strange
low
laugh
was
on
his
lips
their
courses
were
convergent
his
and
that
black
running
shape
and
the
other
had
not
noticed
him
and
there
appeared
to
be
something
a
package
under
the
other
arm
the
hawk
as
he
ran
slipped
his
mask
over
his
face
was
it
the
dummy
the
thousand
in
cash
had
the
man
succeeded
or
had
the
yard
engine
backing
down
to
couple
on
disturbed
him
in
his
attempt
just
at
the
psychological
instant
again
that
strange
low
laugh
in
a
panting
breath
was
on
the
hawk
lips
it
did
not
matter
there
was
a
way
now
he
was
not
too
late
if
he
got
both
of
the
packages
he
could
not
there
was
a
way
to
accomplish
that
a
wild
way
but
a
sure
way
it
was
black
pitch
black
in
near
the
shed
and
the
hawk
with
the
shorter
distance
to
cover
reached
the
edge
of
the
freight
shed
platform
and
crouched
down
on
the
track
came
the
faint
crash
and
bump
of
the
yard
engine
coupling
to
the
private
car
then
the
short
quick
gasps
of
a
runner
out
of
breath
and
a
flying
form
bounded
across
the
tracks
sprang
to
the
platform
and
dashed
for
the
freight
shed
the
hawk
his
muscles
rigid
taut
as
steel
released
suddenly
as
a
coiled
spring
is
released
leaped
and
hurled
himself
upon
the
other
there
was
a
yell
of
dismay
of
surprise
and
fury
that
seemed
to
echo
from
one
end
of
the
yard
to
the
other
the
man
went
down
in
a
heap
from
the
impact
the
package
from
under
his
arm
rolled
off
along
the
the
hawk
in
a
swoop
was
upon
it
he
snatched
it
up
and
running
like
a
deer
now
headed
for
the
yard
engine
and
the
private
car
came
another
yell
from
behind
him
he
heard
the
freight
shed
door
flung
violently
open
and
then
in
grim
emphasis
of
a
sudden
chorus
of
wild
infuriated
shouts
from
dixer
waiting
companions
the
vicious
tongue
flame
of
a
revolver
split
the
black
and
the
roar
of
the
report
reverberated
through
the
yard
like
a
cannon
shot
and
now
from
the
yard
itself
the
roundhouse
and
the
station
came
answering
shouts
on
the
hawk
was
alongside
the
private
car
now
which
was
already
in
now
he
was
opposite
the
cab
of
the
yard
engine
the
fireman
at
the
sudden
pandemonium
head
thrust
out
was
hanging
in
the
gangway
the
hawk
automatic
swung
to
a
line
with
the
other
head
get
out
gritted
the
hawk
coldly
both
of
and
your
mate
get
the
other
side
the
man
with
a
dazed
oath
retreated
and
the
hawk
sprang
through
the
gangway
the
engineer
jumping
from
his
seat
hesitated
and
in
the
yellow
light
of
the
cab
lamp
looked
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
into
the
muzzle
of
the
hawk
automatic
and
into
the
hard
uncompromising
black
eyes
behind
the
followed
the
fireman
in
a
hasty
exit
through
the
opposite
gangway
the
hawk
snatched
at
the
throttle
pulled
it
like
a
beast
stung
to
sudden
madness
under
the
spur
the
yard
engine
quivered
and
in
a
storm
of
exhausts
coughing
the
red
sparks
skyward
from
the
stack
the
drivers
racing
spitting
fire
as
they
sought
to
bite
and
hold
the
steel
plunged
forward
ahead
the
way
was
clear
to
the
main
line
but
hawk
dropped
his
package
on
the
floor
of
the
cab
leaned
suddenly
far
out
through
the
gangway
and
as
suddenly
fired
his
automatic
cutting
a
lane
of
flame
through
the
darkness
he
had
fired
at
the
ground
but
his
shot
had
been
effective
the
engineer
or
the
fireman
he
could
not
distinguish
which
leaping
to
board
the
private
car
by
the
rear
platform
leaped
back
instead
and
with
a
series
of
wild
gesticulations
in
which
arms
and
fists
waved
furiously
vanished
in
the
darkness
the
yard
engine
as
though
playing
with
the
private
car
behind
it
took
the
main
line
switch
with
a
stagger
and
a
lurch
and
straightened
away
into
the
clear
there
was
speed
now
and
the
speed
was
increasing
with
every
second
the
shouts
the
yells
the
cries
the
pandemonium
from
the
yard
was
blotted
out
in
the
pound
of
the
drivers
and
the
belch
of
the
exhaust
and
the
station
and
switch
lights
were
lost
to
sight
as
engine
and
car
flew
on
heading
west
into
the
foothills
the
hawk
chuckled
to
himself
there
would
be
wild
confusion
in
the
dispatcher
office
and
wild
confusion
all
along
the
line
west
of
selkirk
as
regulars
extras
and
traffic
of
all
sorts
scurried
for
safety
to
the
there
would
be
no
interference
with
him
where
they
would
otherwise
have
ditched
him
given
him
an
open
switch
at
the
first
station
and
sent
him
to
destruction
without
compunction
he
possessed
as
it
was
a
most
satisfactory
hostage
in
the
person
of
the
division
superintendent
whom
they
would
hesitate
about
sending
to
eternity
at
the
same
time
possibly
a
minute
and
a
half
two
at
the
outside
had
passed
since
he
had
jumped
through
the
gangway
he
eased
the
throttle
a
little
now
reducing
the
speed
to
a
rate
more
nearly
commensurate
with
safety
and
placing
the
package
on
the
driver
seat
ripped
off
the
outside
wrapper
there
was
a
queer
hard
smile
on
the
hawk
lips
as
his
fingers
tore
at
the
covering
of
one
of
the
small
sealed
packets
within
was
it
the
dummy
the
thousand
in
cash
had
dixer
was
the
money
still
behind
him
there
in
the
private
car
the
cab
lamp
above
the
dancing
gauge
needles
seemed
to
throw
its
meagre
yellow
glow
with
strained
inquisitiveness
over
the
then
the
hawk
laughed
softly
and
laughed
again
in
his
hands
were
banknotes
he
riffled
the
stack
through
his
fingers
it
was
here
in
his
thousand
dollars
in
cash
and
he
laughed
again
and
glanced
around
the
cab
glass
at
the
white
ribbons
of
steel
glistening
under
the
headlight
glare
around
the
murky
cab
that
in
its
sway
and
jolt
seemed
to
endow
a
legion
of
shadowy
with
movement
vitality
and
life
at
the
platform
of
the
private
car
which
he
could
see
by
looking
along
the
edge
of
the
tender
and
which
like
its
fellow
at
the
rear
was
bathed
in
the
soft
radiance
of
a
dome
light
well
he
might
have
known
from
the
fact
that
the
occupants
of
the
car
had
not
made
any
move
as
yet
at
least
from
the
forward
end
that
they
had
been
in
bed
and
asleep
when
the
disturbance
began
and
he
might
on
that
count
if
he
had
stopped
to
think
have
known
that
dixer
had
succeeded
even
before
he
the
hawk
had
put
it
to
the
proof
by
opening
the
parcel
a
lurch
of
the
cab
sent
him
against
the
seat
and
scattered
the
sealed
packages
he
gathered
them
together
again
hurriedly
he
had
only
to
slow
down
the
engine
a
little
more
jump
to
the
ground
let
the
engine
and
car
go
on
make
his
own
way
back
through
the
fields
and
he
would
be
safe
strange
queer
smile
half
grim
half
whimsical
was
flickering
across
his
he
cared
to
risk
his
life
for
that
dummy
package
back
there
in
the
car
behind
that
contained
nothing
more
valuable
than
neatly
trimmed
pieces
of
blotting
paper
the
smile
lost
its
whimsicality
and
the
grimness
gathered
until
his
lips
drooped
in
sharp
hard
lines
at
the
corners
of
his
abruptly
lifting
up
the
seat
he
swept
the
packages
of
banknotes
into
the
engineer
box
leaped
across
the
cab
and
began
to
claw
his
way
up
over
the
coal
making
for
the
back
of
the
tender
thousand
in
cash
for
me
and
twenty
years
in
the
for
the
kid
does
look
like
an
even
break
muttered
the
hawk
as
he
clawed
his
way
up
maybe
i
a
guess
maybe
i
it
does
look
like
an
even
break
you
see
said
the
hawk
continuing
to
commune
with
himself
they
know
of
course
that
some
one
who
was
meridan
tried
to
get
the
package
but
with
the
package
still
there
they
think
that
the
one
made
a
bull
of
it
and
morning
when
they
open
the
package
and
spot
the
finger
prints
and
get
that
bank
seal
in
meridan
home
they
hold
him
for
it
cold
because
what
happened
around
here
only
look
like
somebody
making
a
try
for
the
goods
without
knowing
they
were
already
gone
the
kid
would
have
a
ladybird
was
dealing
any
aces
except
to
kid
would
go
up
for
having
previously
stolen
the
goods
on
his
own
account
yes
i
guess
he
seal
and
paper
in
his
house
to
make
dummy
packages
i
guess
the
kid
would
stand
a
hot
chance
the
hawk
rose
to
his
feet
at
the
rear
of
the
tender
preparing
to
negotiate
a
leap
down
over
the
ornamental
brass
platform
railing
of
the
private
instantly
flung
himself
back
flat
on
his
face
on
the
coal
the
car
door
was
flung
open
and
lanson
the
superintendent
in
pajamas
a
revolver
in
his
hand
stepped
out
on
the
platform
he
was
closely
followed
by
a
young
the
bank
clerk
in
pajamas
but
apparently
unarmed
and
behind
meridan
again
came
the
negro
porter
lanson
voice
raised
excitedly
carried
to
the
hawk
damn
it
there
no
one
in
the
cab
what
the
devil
sort
of
a
game
is
this
the
hawk
edged
up
to
the
top
of
the
coal
the
next
instant
with
catlike
agility
he
launched
himself
forward
lanson
clambering
over
the
platform
railing
with
the
very
evident
intention
of
making
his
way
via
the
tender
to
the
throttle
gasped
audibly
over
the
racket
of
the
beating
trucks
and
in
a
sort
of
stunned
surprise
and
irresolution
remained
poised
inertly
on
the
railing
as
the
hawk
clinging
now
with
one
hand
to
the
rear
handrail
of
the
switcher
his
feet
planted
on
the
buffer
beam
thrust
the
muzzle
of
his
automatic
into
lanson
face
drop
that
gun
invited
the
hawk
in
a
monotone
the
weapon
from
lanson
hand
clattered
down
struck
the
coupling
and
dropped
to
the
track
the
hawk
spoke
unpleasant
curtness
move
back
and
stand
in
the
doorway
now
you
young
man
you
stand
in
front
of
back
to
him
and
then
as
meridan
too
obeyed
though
more
slowly
than
the
porter
and
with
a
sort
of
defiant
reluctance
the
hawk
addressed
the
superintendent
now
name
lanson
is
it
he
snapped
you
lanson
back
up
against
the
young
fellow
it
sambo
put
your
hands
on
the
young
fellow
you
young
fellow
do
the
same
on
lanson
the
hawk
swung
over
to
the
car
then
the
hawk
smiled
uninvitingly
it
the
backwards
he
explained
insolently
you
get
the
idea
do
you
if
either
of
you
two
behind
lift
your
hands
lanson
in
front
here
pays
for
it
with
you
they
shuffled
backward
into
the
observation
compartment
of
the
car
through
this
and
through
a
narrow
side
corridor
and
emerged
into
the
main
compartment
of
the
car
the
hawk
guiding
their
movements
by
the
simple
expedient
of
prodding
the
muzzle
of
his
automatic
none
too
gently
into
lanson
body
here
ranged
the
three
along
the
side
of
the
car
and
backing
over
to
the
opposite
side
himself
halted
in
front
of
the
bookcase
and
stood
surveying
his
captives
with
his
former
insolent
stare
the
porter
was
patently
reduced
to
a
state
of
nervous
terror
meridan
young
was
white
to
the
lips
and
his
lips
quivered
but
his
eyes
a
hard
bitter
light
in
them
never
left
the
face
lanson
too
was
white
but
there
was
a
stern
composure
in
his
face
that
was
absent
from
the
younger
man
it
was
lanson
who
spoke
i
presume
he
said
evenly
that
you
are
the
abandoned
scoundrel
known
as
the
hawk
whom
one
of
these
days
we
are
the
hawk
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
have
a
calling
card
with
me
but
we
let
it
go
at
that
he
answered
flippantly
the
car
swayed
and
lurched
suddenly
the
trucks
beat
a
louder
tattoo
as
they
clattered
over
a
switch
lights
a
row
of
them
from
without
scintillated
through
the
car
were
gone
they
were
not
running
perilously
fast
but
fast
enough
to
prohibit
the
possibility
of
any
one
even
an
acrobatic
brakeman
from
a
stalled
train
swinging
aboard
the
hawk
laughed
low
also
he
had
been
quite
had
just
passed
a
station
and
thanks
to
the
superintendent
presence
no
attempt
had
been
made
to
interfere
with
the
train
from
one
of
the
hawk
his
left
hawk
produced
a
small
steel
jimmy
he
knelt
down
and
still
covering
the
three
men
inserted
the
jimmy
in
between
the
cupboard
doors
there
was
a
creak
the
rip
and
split
and
tear
of
rending
wood
and
lock
and
the
doors
flew
apart
the
hawk
reached
in
laughed
again
as
with
the
dummy
package
under
his
arm
he
stood
up
and
began
to
back
away
toward
the
corridor
leading
to
the
forward
end
of
the
the
laugh
died
on
his
lips
in
the
winking
of
an
eye
meridan
had
swung
his
hands
from
lanson
shoulders
and
was
springing
forward
you
never
get
it
the
boy
voice
was
a
hoarse
whisper
not
while
keep
away
you
fool
snarled
the
hawk
and
the
floor
his
brain
seemed
instantly
in
a
riot
of
ironical
mockery
he
could
not
fire
at
the
was
the
boy
who
had
brought
him
now
the
other
was
upon
a
wild
at
the
automatic
it
was
only
another
step
backward
to
the
opening
of
the
corridor
and
the
hawk
gained
it
but
still
the
boy
clung
on
fighting
furiously
he
saw
lanson
and
the
porter
leap
forward
but
for
the
moment
that
mattered
more
than
one
at
a
time
could
get
at
him
in
the
confined
and
narrow
space
here
to
hold
the
package
rendered
his
left
arm
useless
he
dropped
the
package
to
the
floor
and
kicked
it
deftly
back
behind
him
as
the
boy
with
both
hands
wrenched
and
battled
madly
for
possession
of
the
automatic
they
were
swaying
now
the
two
of
them
bumping
their
shoulders
and
their
arms
and
elbows
against
first
one
side
of
the
corridor
and
then
the
other
there
was
the
crash
of
splintering
glass
as
they
lunged
into
a
crash
louder
more
ominous
and
with
it
a
tongue
of
flame
as
the
automatic
went
off
in
their
something
like
a
iron
seared
the
hawk
side
and
a
blur
came
before
his
eyes
he
reeled
recovered
himself
and
massing
all
his
strength
for
the
effort
as
with
a
cry
of
triumph
meridan
closed
again
he
tore
himself
free
from
the
other
grasp
there
was
one
was
still
in
possession
of
the
one
way
now
with
a
lightning
swing
he
whipped
the
hutt
of
the
weapon
to
the
other
head
backed
rapidly
away
as
the
boy
slid
a
limp
thing
to
the
floor
and
picking
up
the
package
as
he
moved
backward
holding
the
narrow
corridor
with
his
automatic
though
lanson
was
kneeling
now
at
meridan
side
he
reached
the
observation
compartment
whirled
ran
for
the
door
opened
it
and
stepped
out
on
the
platform
he
stood
panting
here
a
little
dizzy
a
sort
of
nauseating
weakness
upon
him
as
he
fumbled
in
his
pocket
he
was
not
as
quick
as
usual
in
his
work
not
as
expert
now
in
the
use
of
his
skeleton
keys
but
swiftly
for
all
that
he
locked
the
car
door
the
car
and
the
engine
seemed
to
sway
and
lurch
and
pitch
and
toss
as
they
had
never
done
before
was
the
speed
greater
what
was
it
he
stumbled
and
nearly
fell
as
he
climbed
to
the
tender
he
fell
unable
to
maintain
his
footing
in
the
shifting
coal
as
he
reached
the
cab
there
was
something
hot
and
wet
that
seemed
to
be
working
its
way
down
his
leg
his
side
was
giving
him
intolerable
pain
he
looked
at
the
package
in
his
hands
looked
at
it
queerly
for
a
moment
and
then
his
drawn
lips
parted
in
the
old
whimsical
smile
as
he
lurched
forward
and
opened
the
door
the
red
glow
filled
the
cab
and
spread
upward
tinging
the
sky
with
a
rosy
the
hawk
thrust
the
package
into
the
fire
and
swaying
unsteadily
watched
it
burst
into
flame
he
glanced
at
the
gauge
now
the
steam
was
dropping
rapidly
he
swept
his
hand
across
his
eyes
he
had
two
things
to
do
and
it
seemed
as
though
his
brain
clogged
in
its
decision
as
to
which
he
should
do
had
to
get
more
coal
on
the
fire
or
else
the
engine
would
run
down
and
he
did
not
want
it
to
run
down
for
it
must
keep
on
going
a
long
way
a
very
long
way
if
possible
after
he
left
it
and
he
must
stop
the
flow
of
blood
from
his
wound
somehow
or
he
put
coal
into
the
it
was
painful
dizzy
work
and
he
spilled
a
great
deal
of
it
and
the
lumps
rolled
over
the
floor
of
the
cab
and
he
stumbled
over
the
lumps
the
hawk
teeth
were
biting
into
his
bloodless
lips
as
he
finally
shut
the
door
and
staggering
to
the
side
of
the
cab
lifted
up
the
engineer
seat
again
here
under
the
packages
of
banknotes
he
found
a
bunch
of
waste
and
some
cord
and
then
reeling
with
the
lurch
of
the
cab
reeling
with
his
own
weakness
that
only
an
iron
nerve
held
back
from
mastering
him
he
examined
his
wound
found
it
though
painful
and
bleeding
profusely
to
be
only
a
bad
flesh
wound
and
making
a
thick
pad
of
the
waste
he
laid
it
against
his
side
and
bound
it
there
by
passing
the
cord
tightly
several
times
around
his
body
it
was
a
crude
bandage
but
it
should
at
least
check
the
flow
of
if
he
had
luck
there
would
be
opportunity
for
a
better
one
his
mind
reverted
seemingly
without
volition
of
his
to
the
fight
in
the
car
and
he
spoke
aloud
i
guess
said
the
hawk
i
did
hit
him
as
hard
as
twenty
years
in
the
would
have
hit
guess
i
did
hit
him
that
he
rested
for
a
moment
sitting
on
the
floor
of
the
cab
then
from
the
engineer
box
he
removed
the
sealed
packages
the
torn
outside
wrapper
and
likewise
an
evening
newspaper
which
he
found
there
he
wrapped
up
the
banknotes
in
the
newspaper
tied
the
bundle
securely
with
the
remainder
of
his
cord
replaced
the
seat
and
crouched
low
enough
on
the
floor
to
be
protected
by
the
tender
from
say
a
shot
fired
through
the
observation
window
of
the
private
car
kept
his
eyes
fastened
on
the
right
of
way
ahead
the
next
station
must
be
close
at
hand
and
there
was
but
one
way
in
which
he
could
get
back
to
he
must
get
back
there
was
that
ladybird
would
be
received
in
elkhead
in
the
morning
his
brain
was
clearer
now
he
must
be
on
extra
no
the
eastbound
fast
freight
running
time
and
she
must
be
somewhere
very
near
here
must
have
taken
to
the
siding
at
the
next
station
probably
to
avoid
him
and
to
give
clearance
to
what
was
undoubtedly
now
coming
behind
detective
special
with
macvightie
naturally
in
command
he
straightened
up
painfully
ahead
he
had
caught
the
glint
of
switch
and
station
lights
the
siding
was
on
the
side
he
moved
to
the
side
of
the
cab
and
lay
on
the
cab
floor
by
the
gangway
that
letter
it
seemed
to
obsess
him
now
if
when
the
letter
was
read
the
bank
seal
the
wax
and
the
wrapping
paper
were
found
hidden
in
the
boy
home
the
fact
that
some
the
stolen
the
package
from
the
car
in
no
way
changed
anything
the
boy
apparent
prior
guilt
was
as
glaring
as
ever
on
the
other
hand
with
the
package
gone
and
if
the
seal
and
those
other
things
were
not
found
the
letter
became
simply
the
expression
of
some
practical
joker
perverted
sense
of
humour
or
the
irresponsible
work
of
some
fool
or
crank
he
frowned
in
a
sort
of
dazed
irritation
he
had
known
that
all
along
had
he
he
had
known
when
he
started
after
that
dummy
package
in
the
first
place
that
he
would
have
to
go
all
the
why
was
his
mind
dwelling
now
on
useless
repetitions
the
hawk
raised
his
head
deafening
racket
was
in
his
ears
the
freight
was
the
siding
he
was
roaring
past
it
now
he
could
not
hope
for
an
open
boxcar
on
the
fast
freight
his
eyes
were
searching
eagerly
for
a
flat
flat
car
loaded
with
anything
that
would
afford
him
shelter
was
of
with
steel
girders
the
roar
subsided
he
was
past
the
station
and
into
the
clear
now
the
hawk
was
at
the
throttle
easing
the
speed
craftily
he
did
not
dare
to
shut
off
entirely
for
behind
there
at
the
station
they
would
know
if
the
sound
of
the
exhaust
ceased
that
he
had
stopped
he
checked
a
little
with
the
air
now
and
now
calculating
the
speed
reduced
enough
to
risk
a
jump
he
opened
the
throttle
to
its
former
notch
took
up
his
newspaper
package
lowered
himself
to
the
bottom
gangway
step
and
swung
off
he
rolled
down
the
embankment
the
switcher
and
private
car
went
by
and
gradually
gaining
speed
again
racketed
on
up
the
right
of
way
with
a
groan
the
hawk
readjusted
his
displaced
and
makeshift
bandage
and
began
to
make
his
way
back
toward
the
station
if
he
had
slowed
enough
to
allow
of
a
safe
landing
for
himself
he
had
of
course
given
lanson
the
same
he
had
no
fear
of
that
lanson
might
have
jumped
but
whom
he
had
left
unconscious
could
and
lanson
would
stick
to
meridan
as
for
the
hawk
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
he
looked
about
porter
had
not
jumped
he
stumbled
on
if
he
were
right
if
they
had
started
a
posse
on
a
special
in
pursuit
he
had
plenty
of
time
the
fast
freight
could
not
pull
out
until
the
special
had
gone
by
it
seemed
a
long
way
an
interminable
way
an
immeasurably
greater
distance
than
he
had
covered
coming
up
on
the
switcher
and
then
at
last
the
of
the
stalled
freight
came
into
sight
around
a
bend
and
grew
brighter
and
then
too
there
came
from
the
eastward
the
rumble
of
an
approaching
train
he
grew
cautious
now
and
creeping
far
out
from
the
side
of
the
track
passed
the
caboose
crept
in
again
toward
the
line
of
cars
located
the
position
of
the
flat
cars
climbed
aboard
one
of
them
and
crawled
in
under
the
girders
the
hawk
lay
very
quiet
he
was
weak
again
and
his
head
swam
and
he
was
dizzy
an
engine
and
and
his
posse
by
on
the
main
line
and
then
presently
the
freight
with
a
clatter
and
bang
echoing
from
one
to
another
down
the
length
of
cars
drew
out
of
the
station
when
the
hawk
moved
again
it
was
as
the
train
whistled
and
slowed
for
the
selkirk
yard
perhaps
twenty
minutes
had
fast
freight
with
no
stops
and
already
late
had
made
time
he
put
his
mask
in
his
pocket
wormed
his
way
out
from
under
the
girders
and
peered
ahead
and
behind
they
were
just
crawling
into
the
upper
end
of
the
yard
he
slid
to
the
ground
found
himself
a
little
more
steady
on
his
feet
slipped
across
the
spur
tracks
dodged
in
between
two
buildings
that
flanked
the
side
of
the
yard
and
came
out
on
the
street
under
a
street
lamp
the
hawk
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
one
he
swayed
a
little
again
but
his
lips
set
hard
there
was
not
very
much
time
somewhere
up
the
line
the
switcher
and
the
private
car
would
come
to
a
stop
and
they
would
bring
meridan
once
that
happened
with
its
consequent
stir
in
meridan
apartment
it
would
be
impossible
to
get
in
there
and
the
game
as
far
as
the
boy
was
concerned
would
be
up
yes
said
the
hawk
as
he
forced
himself
along
the
street
i
guess
maybe
that
guess
maybe
i
a
it
was
an
even
a
street
car
at
the
next
corner
took
him
across
town
and
fifteen
minutes
more
found
him
standing
in
the
unlighted
vestibule
of
the
linden
apartments
the
tiny
flashlight
swept
the
ground
floor
apartment
an
instant
later
the
door
of
apartment
b
yielded
noiselessly
to
the
deft
manipulation
of
a
skeleton
key
the
hawk
closed
the
door
and
stole
forward
it
was
a
rather
fashionable
apartment
as
the
ladybird
had
said
but
it
was
also
a
very
small
one
small
enough
to
warrant
the
presumption
that
the
young
couple
did
not
keep
a
servant
and
that
there
would
probably
be
no
one
there
except
meridan
wife
a
door
at
his
right
as
he
felt
out
in
the
darkness
he
found
to
be
open
he
the
sound
of
breathing
there
was
nothing
the
flashlight
the
hawk
stepped
forward
into
the
room
it
was
the
sitting
room
the
flashlight
was
sweeping
about
now
in
an
inquisitive
little
ray
a
door
closed
leading
to
an
inner
room
was
on
his
right
facing
him
was
a
heavily
portièred
window
the
portières
drawn
and
a
little
to
the
left
of
the
window
was
the
mantel
the
flashlight
ray
wavered
suddenly
the
hawk
caught
at
the
nearest
thing
to
him
the
table
in
the
centre
of
the
room
for
support
a
sense
of
disaster
upon
him
a
realisation
that
lashed
on
as
it
might
be
by
force
of
will
there
was
a
limit
to
physical
endurance
and
that
the
limit
had
well
nigh
been
reached
his
hand
brushed
across
his
eyes
and
brushed
across
them
again
to
clear
his
sight
as
he
tried
to
follow
the
flashlight
ray
to
where
it
played
jerkily
on
a
massively
framed
picture
over
the
mantel
he
bit
his
lips
now
bit
them
until
they
moved
laid
his
parcel
of
banknotes
on
the
floor
that
he
might
have
the
use
of
both
climbed
upon
a
chair
and
felt
in
behind
the
picture
was
there
his
fingers
closed
on
a
roll
of
paper
twitched
and
shook
a
little
as
they
pulled
it
a
small
package
from
inside
the
roll
fell
with
a
slight
thud
to
the
mantel
and
from
the
mantel
bounded
off
to
the
floor
the
hawk
caught
his
breath
as
he
listened
and
descended
from
the
chair
clumsy
fool
he
gritted
fiercely
as
he
knelt
on
the
floor
guess
i
pretty
near
the
count
to
do
a
thing
like
the
flashlight
came
into
play
again
and
disclosed
a
metal
seal
and
several
pieces
of
wax
peeping
through
the
paper
wrapper
that
had
been
split
apart
in
the
fall
he
picked
them
up
and
put
them
in
his
pocket
then
loosening
his
vest
he
tucked
the
roll
of
wrapping
paper
inside
his
shirt
well
it
was
done
now
he
had
only
to
get
back
to
his
room
and
there
was
surely
strength
enough
left
for
that
again
his
hand
swept
across
his
eyes
and
pressed
hard
against
his
then
stooping
swiftly
he
clutched
at
his
package
of
banknotes
on
the
floor
beside
him
and
stood
up
rigid
and
tense
out
of
the
darkness
almost
at
his
elbow
with
a
startling
clamour
that
clashed
and
shattered
through
the
silence
and
seemed
to
set
a
thousand
echoes
reverberating
through
the
room
came
the
ringing
of
the
telephone
some
one
in
the
inner
room
stirred
the
hawk
drew
back
hurriedly
into
the
window
recess
behind
the
portières
the
telephone
rang
again
there
came
a
step
now
and
now
the
room
was
flooded
with
light
and
a
woman
a
dressing
gown
flung
hastily
over
her
shoulders
crossed
from
the
inner
doorway
to
the
table
and
picked
up
the
instrument
yes
hello
what
is
it
she
asked
a
little
sleepily
yes
this
is
meridan
what
my
husband
her
voice
rang
out
in
sudden
terror
what
did
you
say
she
cried
frantically
yes
you
are
not
telling
me
all
the
are
trying
to
keep
the
worst
from
god
sake
tell
me
the
truth
not
dangerous
you
are
are
sure
yes
yes
i
understand
at
the
station
in
half
an
hour
i
will
be
mechanically
she
hung
the
receiver
on
the
hook
and
clung
for
a
moment
to
the
table
edge
her
face
grey
and
bloodless
and
then
her
lips
moved
and
one
hand
clenched
until
the
skin
across
the
knuckles
was
an
ivory
white
i
pray
god
they
get
this
hawk
she
whispered
i
pray
god
they
do
and
i
pray
god
they
kill
him
the
coward
the
miserable
pitiful
coward
the
hawk
fingers
were
digging
at
the
window
sill
because
somehow
his
knees
were
refusing
to
support
his
weight
what
was
she
saying
he
did
not
quite
understand
well
it
did
not
matter
she
was
gone
now
into
that
other
she
had
left
the
light
on
it
was
very
strange
the
way
his
hand
on
the
window
sill
seemed
to
keep
pulling
his
body
around
in
circles
time
had
lost
concrete
significance
to
the
hawk
she
appeared
again
fully
dressed
now
and
switching
off
the
light
went
out
into
the
hall
and
the
front
door
closed
behind
her
the
hawk
parted
the
portières
and
staggered
across
the
a
moment
later
a
dark
form
a
newspaper
parcel
clutched
under
its
arm
emerged
stealthily
from
the
vestibule
and
reeling
like
a
drunken
man
disappeared
in
the
darkness
down
the
street
hole
in
the
wall
the
wound
was
at
least
if
the
hawk
had
unduly
shortened
his
period
of
convalescence
he
was
perhaps
justified
and
not
wholly
without
excuse
he
stood
now
in
the
black
shadows
hugged
close
to
the
wall
of
the
roundhouse
and
now
he
moved
stealthily
forward
until
from
a
crouched
position
he
straightened
up
against
the
wall
at
the
side
of
one
of
the
few
windows
which
were
lighted
lanson
had
strolled
aimlessly
across
the
tracks
from
the
station
some
ten
minutes
before
and
five
minutes
later
macvightie
had
followed
their
chosen
spot
for
secret
conferences
this
little
cubbyhole
of
a
turner
office
in
the
roundhouse
as
the
hawk
from
more
than
one
experience
in
the
past
had
very
good
reason
to
know
they
were
in
there
now
and
as
the
hawk
was
likewise
exceedingly
well
aware
the
events
of
the
next
few
hours
and
incidentally
his
own
particular
movements
depended
very
pertinently
upon
the
movements
of
macvightie
and
lanson
lanson
voice
in
quietly
modulated
tones
reached
the
hawk
yes
both
trains
are
on
time
to
the
minute
i
taken
care
of
that
and
so
far
there
does
seem
to
be
a
hitch
anywhere
and
with
your
men
boarding
the
trains
west
of
here
at
different
stations
along
the
line
and
mixing
quietly
with
the
passengers
i
do
see
how
any
one
could
be
the
wiser
on
that
score
yes
it
looks
as
though
everything
were
all
macvightie
i
do
know
i
hope
so
macvightie
deep
growl
came
in
reply
anyhow
we
carried
out
instructions
from
washington
and
it
up
to
the
secret
service
crowd
as
to
how
it
pans
no
it
is
declared
lanson
still
quietly
it
is
up
to
a
soul
on
earth
except
those
of
us
who
have
got
the
responsibility
of
this
division
on
our
shoulders
i
believe
the
plan
is
a
good
one
but
because
it
came
from
washington
does
let
us
for
a
minute
what
about
birks
has
he
shown
up
yet
not
yet
macvightie
swore
suddenly
under
his
breath
and
i
do
mind
admitting
that
the
crowd
down
there
in
washington
make
me
tired
it
over
two
weeks
ago
that
i
put
it
up
to
them
they
said
they
would
take
the
matter
under
consideration
and
in
any
case
would
send
one
of
their
men
this
birks
out
here
to
make
an
investigation
but
nothing
doing
then
as
you
know
i
wrote
them
again
a
week
ago
when
we
knew
this
alaskan
gold
shipment
was
coming
through
and
you
know
their
reply
they
outlined
a
plan
for
us
and
stated
definitely
that
birks
would
be
on
deck
maybe
he
time
to
tell
us
what
we
should
have
done
the
secret
service
is
a
police
force
said
lanson
tersely
the
only
excuse
they
would
have
for
acting
at
all
would
be
if
your
pet
theory
were
the
hawk
and
his
gang
apart
from
their
systematised
murders
and
robberies
were
also
the
ones
who
have
been
flooding
the
country
with
those
counterfeit
notes
you
had
no
actual
proof
to
offer
and
washington
evidently
has
felt
quite
so
sure
about
it
as
you
have
however
there
no
use
discussing
that
if
birks
shows
up
all
right
if
he
i
do
see
that
he
could
make
any
difference
one
way
or
the
other
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
then
lanson
spoke
again
what
worries
me
as
much
as
anything
he
said
slowly
is
the
express
company
making
a
shipment
of
money
at
the
same
thousand
dollars
in
the
car
safe
of
course
it
logical
enough
with
a
half
million
to
guard
anyway
but
it
an
added
incentive
to
those
devils
that
all
a
half
million
in
raw
gold
is
any
easy
thing
to
pick
up
and
walk
off
with
and
there
more
than
an
even
chance
that
the
wire
devils
might
pass
it
up
on
that
account
but
with
banknotes
alone
in
so
large
an
if
they
know
about
it
interrupted
macvightie
brusquely
and
it
not
likely
they
do
you
ca
send
a
heavily
guarded
express
car
on
from
the
coast
and
keep
it
mum
that
gold
is
going
through
especially
when
the
papers
print
pictures
of
the
cases
being
swung
out
of
the
steamer
hold
on
arrival
from
the
different
i
not
banking
on
them
passing
up
the
gold
on
any
account
though
they
may
at
that
but
in
any
case
they
be
welcome
to
open
the
safe
now
wo
they
again
there
was
an
instant
silence
and
the
hawk
now
as
though
fearful
of
losing
a
word
that
might
be
spoken
strained
forward
closer
still
to
the
side
of
the
window
yes
that
right
lanson
laughed
now
in
a
grimly
humorous
way
it
in
the
biggest
case
of
all
yes
i
guess
it
all
right
macvightie
anyway
another
hour
or
two
will
tell
the
story
the
shift
should
have
been
made
at
mornleigh
without
any
trouble
and
the
limited
will
come
through
here
without
a
thing
in
the
express
car
except
the
guards
if
they
hold
her
up
anywhere
on
the
division
that
all
they
guards
and
one
of
your
posses
yes
it
ought
to
lanson
voice
took
on
a
curiously
monotonous
drone
as
though
he
were
checking
over
the
details
in
his
own
mind
and
unconsciously
doing
so
audibly
the
limited
takes
water
at
mornleigh
and
no
always
takes
the
siding
there
to
let
the
limited
pass
so
there
nothing
in
that
to
arouse
suspicion
in
the
darkness
with
the
door
of
the
limited
express
car
only
a
foot
or
so
away
from
the
door
of
no
baggage
car
and
a
picked
crew
to
transfer
the
gold
i
do
see
how
there
could
be
any
the
limited
pulls
in
here
with
its
guarded
express
looks
just
as
those
wire
devils
would
expect
it
to
they
know
the
gold
left
the
coast
on
that
train
and
in
that
car
yes
i
think
we
win
if
they
hold
up
the
limited
they
catch
a
tartar
and
without
any
risk
on
our
part
as
far
as
the
gold
is
concerned
how
many
men
in
the
posse
scattered
through
the
cars
on
that
train
twenty
said
macvightie
tersely
good
said
lanson
approvingly
that
ought
to
be
enough
to
round
them
they
nibble
at
the
bait
at
all
and
if
they
do
if
they
let
the
limited
go
through
unmolested
it
will
be
pretty
nearly
safe
to
assume
as
i
said
before
that
they
figure
gold
in
the
bulk
is
too
awkward
a
thing
to
handle
and
too
hard
to
get
away
with
but
even
there
we
are
not
taking
any
chances
they
might
have
discovered
that
it
had
been
transferred
how
many
men
in
the
posse
on
no
the
same
number
replied
then
fist
crashed
down
into
the
palm
of
his
hand
i
hope
they
start
something
he
exclaimed
savagely
i
give
a
year
salary
to
get
to
grips
with
them
and
if
i
ever
do
i
clean
out
and
i
see
that
some
of
them
and
particularly
that
damned
hawk
swing
for
it
i
have
forgotten
the
murder
of
old
mother
barrett
boy
in
the
express
car
that
night
or
a
dozen
others
that
your
end
of
it
macvightie
said
lanson
grimly
mine
to
see
five
hundred
thousand
dollars
worth
of
bullion
and
forty
thousand
in
cash
over
this
division
and
safely
on
its
way
east
if
the
the
hawk
slipping
silently
out
of
the
shadows
began
to
cross
the
railroad
yard
heading
for
the
station
forty
thousand
dollars
said
the
hawk
softly
to
chuckled
suddenly
forty
thousand
dollars
in
a
big
packing
case
the
biggest
case
of
the
lot
he
said
was
it
the
chuckle
died
away
and
the
hawk
face
grew
hard
i
do
know
muttered
the
hawk
it
no
cinch
i
guess
there
be
something
doing
a
glance
at
the
illuminated
dial
of
the
clock
on
the
station
tower
showed
it
to
be
half
past
eight
as
the
hawk
stepped
to
the
platform
he
hesitated
an
instant
in
indecision
then
went
on
into
the
general
waiting
room
there
was
ample
time
the
limited
was
not
due
for
another
hour
and
no
which
alone
he
had
now
any
not
schedule
selkirk
until
forty
minutes
after
the
limited
nearly
two
hours
the
hawk
standing
in
the
doorway
of
the
waiting
room
ostentatiously
consulted
a
which
he
drew
from
his
pocket
frowned
glanced
about
him
and
finally
approaching
the
which
appeared
for
the
moment
to
be
minus
an
attendant
helped
himself
to
a
newspaper
tossed
a
copper
on
top
of
the
pile
and
appropriated
the
nearest
seat
the
hawk
opened
his
paper
in
front
of
over
the
top
of
the
paper
inspected
with
some
interest
the
view
afforded
by
the
open
doorway
of
the
which
was
directly
facing
him
and
but
a
few
feet
away
the
was
a
long
narrow
affair
glass
enclosed
with
big
sliding
windows
making
one
corner
of
the
waiting
room
and
at
its
further
end
boasted
a
little
office
of
its
own
the
door
of
this
private
domain
was
closed
but
it
too
was
glass
panelled
and
the
apparent
absence
of
any
attendant
was
explained
the
hawk
permitted
a
curious
smile
to
flicker
across
his
lips
behind
his
newspaper
inside
the
little
office
a
man
sprawled
forward
in
a
chair
his
head
resting
on
his
arms
which
were
outflung
across
the
desk
in
front
of
him
appeared
to
be
sound
asleep
and
magnificently
oblivious
to
anything
so
grossly
material
as
business
the
hawk
shifted
his
glance
this
time
for
a
more
critical
survey
of
the
waiting
room
he
found
himself
strangely
enough
quite
sheltered
from
observation
true
it
was
between
trains
and
there
were
very
few
people
in
the
had
noted
several
women
and
an
elderly
man
with
a
little
boy
as
he
had
come
these
were
now
screened
from
his
view
by
the
large
posts
or
pillars
that
in
the
remodelling
and
enlargement
of
the
station
some
years
before
had
sought
to
combine
evidently
ornamentation
with
stability
the
hawk
eyes
under
cover
of
his
newspaper
reverted
to
the
man
at
the
desk
the
minutes
ten
of
them
the
man
hours
were
long
undoubtedly
and
usually
there
were
two
in
charge
of
the
which
might
perhaps
account
for
the
man
weariness
and
the
profound
slumber
that
was
possible
even
in
such
an
uncomfortable
position
the
hawk
turned
to
the
editorial
page
of
his
newspaper
there
were
almost
two
hours
before
no
was
due
and
though
he
had
a
little
business
of
a
purely
personal
and
intimate
nature
to
transact
before
then
there
was
time
in
abundance
and
to
spare
and
it
might
possibly
be
utilised
as
profitably
here
as
anywhere
else
in
any
case
there
was
usually
an
editorial
diatribe
interesting
principally
for
the
virulent
language
in
which
it
was
couched
anent
the
hawk
and
the
wire
devils
with
whose
leadership
he
the
hawk
was
universally
credited
the
hawk
smiled
thinly
if
leadership
was
vested
in
the
lion
portion
of
the
spoils
then
macvightie
and
lanson
and
the
newspapers
and
the
public
generally
were
unquestionably
since
those
spoils
had
been
snatched
from
under
the
noses
of
the
wire
devils
thanks
to
his
possession
of
their
secret
code
the
wire
devils
and
the
ladybird
in
particular
that
peer
of
the
underworld
who
as
he
had
discovered
a
few
nights
ago
was
the
moving
spirit
of
the
gang
held
a
very
different
and
even
more
decided
opinion
on
the
subject
he
folded
the
paper
over
and
sprawled
himself
out
lazily
on
his
if
the
editorial
in
question
was
on
the
sheet
before
him
he
did
not
see
it
the
man
at
the
desk
raised
his
head
yawned
stretched
himself
and
as
though
wearily
resuming
his
work
reached
into
a
small
drawer
that
stood
open
in
the
upper
section
of
the
desk
took
out
a
pad
of
paper
and
began
to
write
still
another
five
minutes
passed
and
then
the
man
tossed
his
pencil
away
from
him
and
reached
out
for
the
telephone
at
his
elbow
but
now
he
seemed
to
hesitate
then
evidently
changed
his
mind
he
pushed
back
his
chair
stood
up
tore
the
sheet
of
paper
on
which
he
had
been
writing
from
the
pad
replaced
the
pad
in
the
drawer
closed
the
drawer
and
turning
quickly
opened
the
office
door
he
came
down
the
narrow
space
behind
the
itself
stepped
out
into
the
waiting
room
glanced
hurriedly
about
him
and
breaking
suddenly
into
a
run
disappeared
through
the
waiting
room
door
in
the
direction
of
the
platform
the
hawks
lassitude
seemed
suddenly
to
have
vanished
in
a
flash
he
had
covered
the
few
feet
of
space
that
separated
his
seat
from
the
doorway
of
the
and
now
crouched
low
hidden
by
the
counter
itself
he
darted
silently
for
the
little
office
gained
it
wrenched
open
the
drawer
of
the
over
the
hawk
set
tense
features
there
flickered
again
that
curious
smile
faint
muffled
but
none
the
less
distinctly
there
came
from
the
interior
of
the
drawer
which
as
he
reached
in
his
hand
he
found
was
open
through
to
the
wall
the
clicking
of
a
telegraph
sounder
but
while
he
listened
the
hawk
was
working
with
breathless
haste
his
fingers
closed
on
the
pad
of
paper
and
tore
off
the
topmost
sheet
without
folding
or
crushing
the
paper
he
laid
it
carefully
inside
his
vest
buttoned
his
vest
over
it
again
closed
the
drawer
of
the
desk
in
another
instant
was
lolling
again
in
his
seat
in
the
waiting
room
apparently
immersed
once
more
in
his
newspaper
it
had
taken
the
hawk
a
matter
of
less
than
a
minute
to
go
and
come
but
for
all
that
his
margin
of
safety
had
been
small
the
man
returned
almost
instantly
and
again
entered
the
office
the
hawk
finding
that
for
once
the
editorial
which
might
have
afforded
him
a
genuine
if
passing
interest
was
absent
turned
another
page
of
the
paper
spent
a
few
minutes
in
the
somewhat
unprofitable
perusal
of
what
proved
to
be
massed
columns
of
help
wanted
and
situations
vacant
advertisements
and
finally
throwing
the
paper
down
on
the
seat
beside
him
got
up
leisurely
and
strolled
out
through
the
main
entrance
of
the
station
to
the
street
the
hawk
crossed
the
road
and
slipped
into
the
lane
that
was
almost
opposite
the
station
this
being
accustomed
ground
to
the
hawk
he
made
his
way
quickly
along
in
the
blackness
reached
the
first
intersecting
street
dove
through
the
doorway
of
the
dirty
and
squalid
building
the
ground
floor
of
which
was
occupied
by
a
saloon
and
mounting
the
narrow
staircase
entered
the
room
that
was
directly
over
the
saloon
on
the
first
landing
the
hawk
locked
the
door
behind
him
if
his
temporary
abode
in
selkirk
city
could
be
so
designated
the
hawk
was
at
home
he
switched
on
the
electric
light
drew
a
chair
up
to
the
cheap
and
somewhat
dilapidated
table
that
stood
against
the
wall
opposite
the
door
and
from
under
his
vest
took
out
the
sheet
of
paper
he
had
purloined
a
few
minutes
before
he
spread
it
out
eagerly
before
him
on
the
table
scanned
it
closely
and
into
his
dark
eyes
there
came
a
half
mocking
half
triumphant
gleam
i
thought
so
murmured
the
hawk
he
did
dare
telephone
it
i
thought
the
messages
must
be
coming
in
pretty
hot
other
fellow
must
have
gone
up
to
the
east
end
to
shoot
some
mighty
important
reply
back
or
else
he
never
have
left
his
pal
no
wonder
i
never
tumbled
to
that
lay
until
the
ladybird
opened
the
bag
i
did
recognise
those
fellows
did
i
why
should
i
they
new
ones
just
breaking
into
the
game
or
they
never
have
pulled
a
fool
stunt
like
this
the
hawk
bent
over
the
paper
in
places
the
impression
left
by
the
pencil
was
faint
and
indeed
illegible
and
had
not
come
through
from
the
upper
sheet
at
all
but
the
hawk
patiently
and
painstakingly
settled
himself
to
his
task
the
first
few
lines
were
but
a
confused
and
to
all
outward
appearances
meaningless
jumble
of
letters
run
of
the
wire
devils
code
messages
and
here
if
this
had
been
all
the
hawk
would
have
been
hopelessly
astray
but
lower
down
on
the
sheet
the
man
had
decoded
the
cipher
and
here
where
letters
and
words
were
too
faintly
impressed
on
the
paper
or
were
missing
altogether
the
hawk
was
able
to
supply
them
by
following
the
general
sense
of
the
message
he
began
by
tracing
over
the
impressions
carefully
with
a
sharp
lead
pencil
and
at
the
expiration
of
a
few
minutes
was
staring
a
grim
smile
on
his
lips
at
the
following
gold
transferred
to
no
at
momleigh
keep
away
from
limited
probably
big
posse
on
no
every
man
will
join
number
one
on
train
those
boarding
no
at
selkirk
must
on
no
account
excite
suspicion
all
other
details
to
the
hawk
remark
as
he
reached
into
his
inside
coat
pocket
and
brought
out
several
small
slips
of
paper
which
he
laid
on
the
table
in
front
of
him
was
seemingly
quite
irrelevant
yes
said
the
hawk
i
been
curious
ever
since
yesterday
to
get
a
look
at
that
i
guess
the
ladybird
no
fool
the
hawk
arranged
the
slips
of
paper
in
what
appeared
to
be
a
sort
of
chronological
order
and
studied
them
for
a
moment
prefacing
the
message
he
had
just
obtained
these
others
messages
that
he
had
intercepted
at
intervals
during
the
preceding
few
days
made
a
complete
and
decidedly
enlightening
record
the
first
one
decoded
read
reported
movement
of
half
million
in
gold
to
be
made
from
coast
number
three
will
proceed
to
coast
verify
and
secure
the
hawk
nodded
shortly
number
three
was
the
bantam
he
passed
on
to
the
next
message
gold
coming
through
on
limited
on
thursday
night
express
car
well
guarded
numbers
one
seven
eight
six
and
four
will
board
limited
at
different
stopping
points
west
of
mornleigh
all
others
to
hold
themselves
in
readiness
at
again
the
hawk
nodded
this
was
thursday
night
mornleigh
was
the
limited
last
stop
west
of
selkirk
number
one
was
the
butcher
and
the
others
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
he
had
once
facetiously
remarked
somebody
must
have
left
the
door
of
sing
sing
open
there
was
still
another
message
hold
up
train
three
miles
east
of
echo
rock
detach
express
car
and
run
to
willow
creek
bridge
load
gold
on
wagon
and
the
hawk
consulted
his
watch
it
was
a
quarter
past
nine
he
took
out
his
pipe
lighted
it
put
his
feet
up
on
the
table
and
gathering
together
the
various
slips
of
paper
abstractedly
began
to
tear
them
into
shreds
pieced
together
the
whole
affair
was
quite
simple
in
a
word
every
move
that
had
been
made
by
larson
and
macvightie
at
the
instigation
of
the
secret
service
men
and
presumably
in
particular
by
one
birks
was
known
to
the
ladybird
and
the
wire
devils
lanson
and
macvightie
had
waited
until
the
last
moment
before
making
the
transfer
at
mornleigh
the
final
stop
before
selkirk
but
the
bantam
was
already
accompanying
the
gold
east
on
the
limited
and
added
to
the
bantam
by
that
time
there
would
have
been
those
others
who
were
detailed
to
board
the
limited
at
the
various
points
still
further
west
of
mornleigh
it
was
very
simple
the
bantam
had
not
been
asleep
at
mornleigh
and
it
was
not
the
contents
of
the
express
car
alone
that
had
been
transferred
bantam
and
his
companions
had
likewise
transferred
themselves
to
no
also
either
because
the
bantam
had
spotted
some
of
macvightie
men
or
because
logical
deductions
in
the
very
shrewd
brain
had
led
to
that
conclusion
it
was
known
that
no
harboured
a
posse
it
was
evident
however
that
this
in
no
way
dismayed
the
ladybird
and
it
was
equally
evident
that
both
and
macvightie
were
very
far
astray
in
their
estimate
of
the
nerve
and
resourcefulness
of
the
brain
behind
the
wire
devils
organisation
to
have
even
considered
it
as
a
possibility
that
the
physical
difficulty
in
the
way
of
handling
a
half
million
in
raw
gold
would
have
caused
the
ladybird
to
hesitate
an
instant
in
an
effort
to
get
his
hands
upon
it
a
half
a
half
million
that
was
the
answer
the
only
change
the
ladybird
had
seen
fit
to
make
was
to
mobilise
as
it
were
the
entire
strength
of
the
wire
devils
to
offset
macvightie
posse
apart
from
that
according
to
the
final
message
the
prearranged
plan
was
to
stand
it
was
not
a
plan
that
was
markedly
original
paralleling
very
closely
as
it
did
the
wire
devils
removal
of
the
safe
from
the
express
car
of
the
last
mail
on
a
certain
night
not
very
long
since
but
this
could
hardly
be
held
up
against
the
were
limitations
to
originality
and
originality
was
a
secondary
consideration
as
compared
with
feasibility
and
success
echo
rock
station
was
two
stations
east
of
conmore
the
wire
devils
far
enough
distant
to
preclude
the
immediate
search
from
spreading
to
the
neighbourhood
of
conmore
and
yet
not
too
far
away
to
make
the
transport
of
the
gold
to
the
isolated
old
farmhouse
impractical
before
daylight
the
details
of
the
holdup
itself
required
little
elucidation
in
whatever
manner
they
might
elect
to
bring
the
train
to
a
stop
all
that
was
necessary
once
that
was
accomplished
was
to
keep
macvightie
men
from
no
baggage
car
while
the
car
itself
into
which
the
wire
devils
would
naturally
retreat
moved
off
down
the
line
to
the
willow
creek
bridge
some
two
or
three
miles
further
on
the
hawk
took
his
pipe
from
his
lips
polished
the
bowl
by
rubbing
it
along
the
side
of
his
nose
and
inspected
the
result
critically
and
then
the
hawk
smiled
pleasantly
to
himself
in
none
of
the
messages
had
the
wire
devils
given
the
slightest
evidence
of
any
knowledge
of
a
fact
that
was
very
near
to
his
the
hawk
heart
it
was
quite
possible
even
probable
that
on
one
point
at
least
lanson
and
macvightie
were
the
wire
devils
were
ignorant
of
the
presence
of
that
forty
thousand
dollars
in
even
supposing
that
they
did
know
they
would
scarcely
give
him
the
hawk
credit
for
being
in
possession
of
the
knowledge
as
well
therefore
bitter
as
was
the
feud
between
them
the
ladybird
would
be
almost
certain
to
ignore
his
the
hawk
existence
in
so
far
as
this
night
work
was
concerned
the
hawk
smile
broadened
it
was
quite
true
he
would
have
no
excuse
on
earth
for
attempting
the
impossible
feat
of
carrying
away
a
half
million
in
forty
thousand
dollars
in
banknotes
was
not
as
prohibitory
in
its
weight
his
problem
therefore
simplified
itself
into
an
intimate
investigation
of
no
baggage
car
before
echo
rock
was
reached
and
before
either
macvightie
posse
or
the
butcher
and
his
ungentle
crowd
in
the
cars
behind
should
have
started
anything
on
their
own
account
yes
said
the
hawk
confidentially
to
the
toe
of
his
boot
yes
i
guess
i
sit
in
for
a
hand
in
the
game
myself
yes
i
guess
it
looks
pretty
the
luck
the
hawk
relapsed
into
silence
still
studying
the
toe
of
his
boot
his
last
remark
seemed
suddenly
to
have
obsessed
him
and
he
frowned
if
the
luck
still
held
it
was
altogether
it
was
far
from
luck
the
ladybird
and
for
that
matter
a
half
dozen
others
of
the
wire
devils
whom
he
could
name
were
not
to
be
lightly
reckoned
with
he
had
no
delusions
on
that
score
since
the
day
he
had
begun
to
trespass
on
the
wire
devils
preserves
listening
when
and
where
he
could
he
had
intercepted
enough
of
their
cipher
messages
as
they
came
over
the
wires
to
enable
him
to
pull
from
the
fire
and
pocket
for
himself
the
chestnuts
they
had
been
so
carefully
roasting
for
themselves
to
turn
in
fact
the
entire
labour
and
effort
of
their
organisation
to
his
own
in
their
turn
they
had
sought
by
every
means
within
their
power
to
trap
him
and
they
had
nearly
caught
him
very
nearly
caught
him
once
and
he
had
realised
that
the
haphazard
method
in
which
not
knowing
their
source
he
had
been
able
to
obtain
the
cipher
messages
would
no
longer
do
it
was
through
those
messages
alone
that
he
could
hope
to
get
a
hint
of
and
thereby
forestall
the
next
trap
they
might
set
for
him
and
then
the
way
had
seemed
to
clear
a
little
when
he
had
at
last
discovered
that
source
in
the
old
farmhouse
near
conmore
and
had
discovered
that
the
ladybird
thought
dead
and
mourned
by
the
underworld
as
one
of
its
greatest
from
a
wheel
chair
now
a
maimed
thing
in
all
save
brain
moved
and
guided
what
macvightie
had
been
pleased
to
call
the
most
powerful
and
dangerous
criminal
organisation
that
had
ever
known
existence
only
on
the
night
that
he
the
hawk
had
made
those
discoveries
he
had
been
wounded
that
was
a
week
ago
for
three
days
not
daring
to
let
it
be
known
that
a
wounded
man
was
in
the
house
he
had
remained
here
in
his
room
nursing
his
hurt
as
best
he
could
it
had
only
been
a
flesh
wound
and
those
three
days
were
all
he
had
allowed
himself
to
remain
inactive
for
in
those
three
days
temporarily
blindfolded
as
to
any
move
against
him
that
the
ladybird
might
make
he
had
lived
like
a
hunted
man
wary
of
every
passing
moment
of
every
sound
without
his
door
his
automatic
never
for
an
instant
out
of
reach
after
that
during
the
past
four
nights
he
had
resumed
his
vigil
at
the
farmhouse
again
the
hawk
smiled
grimly
no
he
laboured
under
no
delusions
as
to
the
craft
the
cunning
and
the
power
of
those
against
whom
he
had
elected
to
play
a
lone
hand
the
four
nights
just
past
had
resulted
in
something
more
than
the
mere
accumulation
of
those
code
messages
he
had
just
read
in
something
besides
a
more
intimate
acquaintanceship
with
the
farmhouse
and
its
surroundings
even
including
the
underground
passage
for
instance
that
led
from
the
wagon
shed
to
a
trapdoor
in
the
had
resulted
last
night
in
a
still
further
insight
into
the
ingenuity
and
the
sort
of
remorseless
mastery
of
detail
through
which
the
organisation
attained
its
ends
the
method
by
which
they
tapped
the
wires
commandeering
the
telegraph
system
of
the
railroad
the
primary
purpose
of
which
was
undoubtedly
to
supply
them
with
the
vital
information
that
must
of
necessity
pass
over
the
wires
and
on
which
they
based
their
own
plans
this
gold
shipment
for
example
or
the
shipment
of
diamonds
from
new
york
of
a
few
weeks
back
was
ingenious
enough
but
still
more
ingenious
when
using
their
secret
code
and
putting
the
wires
to
another
purpose
that
of
enabling
the
ladybird
to
direct
his
operations
and
send
his
orders
as
he
had
done
was
the
method
by
which
those
messages
were
received
every
sounder
on
the
line
carried
them
of
course
and
when
in
isolated
cases
the
gang
was
working
at
smaller
places
along
the
line
they
could
readily
enough
if
expecting
a
message
as
he
the
hawk
had
often
done
keep
within
sound
of
an
instrument
by
the
simple
expedient
of
occupying
a
waiting
room
or
of
lounging
on
the
platform
outside
the
operator
window
but
the
vast
majority
of
the
messages
were
for
those
of
the
gang
who
maintained
a
sort
of
branch
headquarters
in
selkirk
and
such
a
method
was
neither
practical
nor
possible
since
the
first
essential
in
making
the
scheme
of
value
was
that
without
the
chance
of
a
single
message
being
missed
the
messages
should
reach
their
destination
at
any
hour
of
the
day
and
night
again
the
hawk
smiled
grimly
it
had
puzzled
him
a
good
many
it
puzzled
him
no
longer
last
night
the
ladybird
quite
unconscious
of
a
rapt
audience
had
by
a
chance
remark
disclosed
the
secret
and
he
the
hawk
had
seen
the
plan
in
operation
the
it
was
simple
enough
but
it
held
a
deadly
significance
in
its
proof
of
the
fact
that
there
were
no
obstacles
too
great
no
details
too
minute
to
stand
in
the
way
between
the
ladybird
and
the
end
he
sought
the
was
directly
beneath
the
operator
room
upstairs
in
the
old
days
before
the
station
had
been
enlarged
and
modernised
it
had
been
a
somewhat
diminutive
affair
and
where
the
now
stood
had
been
the
superintendent
office
this
had
connected
with
the
room
above
by
means
of
an
speaking
tube
when
the
alterations
had
been
made
the
mouthpieces
both
above
and
below
had
been
removed
the
room
above
had
been
papered
over
and
the
waiting
room
had
been
plastered
but
as
the
wall
had
been
left
intact
the
speaking
tube
had
remained
the
wall
yes
it
was
very
simple
say
a
dint
in
the
wall
in
the
operator
room
above
and
a
slight
tear
in
the
paper
that
if
it
attracted
any
attention
at
all
in
surroundings
where
the
call
boys
backed
their
chairs
against
the
wall
and
kept
their
hair
on
end
with
nickel
thrillers
would
at
least
never
excite
suspicion
and
below
with
the
desk
in
the
little
office
of
the
backed
up
against
it
who
was
to
know
that
a
hole
had
been
punched
in
the
wall
or
for
that
matter
in
the
back
of
the
desk
itself
behind
the
convenient
little
drawer
so
that
one
could
sit
there
and
listen
to
the
sounder
upstairs
also
it
was
quite
obvious
now
why
several
months
ago
the
old
lessee
of
the
had
been
bought
out
by
some
newcomers
the
hawk
lips
tightened
the
game
to
its
full
extent
was
wide
open
now
the
ran
day
and
night
operated
by
four
of
the
gang
in
pairs
one
always
on
duty
at
the
desk
while
should
there
by
any
chance
or
at
any
time
be
an
unwelcome
intruder
in
the
office
the
drawer
had
only
to
be
shut
and
the
sound
was
thereby
eliminated
when
a
message
broke
over
the
wires
above
the
man
on
duty
had
only
to
decipher
it
and
telephone
it
to
what
the
ladybird
had
referred
to
as
the
boarding
house
disguise
it
appeared
now
under
which
the
gang
maintained
its
headquarters
in
the
city
that
was
all
there
was
to
it
it
was
true
the
operation
had
been
a
little
different
but
the
reason
for
that
as
the
hawk
had
already
decided
in
his
own
mind
was
obvious
enough
with
lanson
and
the
authorities
generally
on
the
alert
due
to
the
gold
shipment
coming
through
the
man
had
not
dared
to
take
the
risk
of
telephoning
any
such
message
as
he
had
received
but
had
taken
it
outside
to
where
one
of
the
gang
undoubtedly
in
view
of
the
importance
of
the
night
work
was
on
additional
duty
and
in
readiness
to
receive
and
transmit
it
on
the
instant
say
to
the
local
headquarters
as
for
the
absence
of
the
second
man
at
the
who
ordinarily
preserved
the
pretence
of
catering
to
the
public
it
was
quite
possible
and
indeed
likely
that
he
had
gone
on
a
similar
errand
with
a
previous
message
or
if
one
of
the
rare
occasions
when
it
was
necessary
to
telegraph
a
cipher
message
from
selkirk
had
arisen
he
might
have
to
the
ladybird
the
little
suburban
station
at
the
east
end
of
the
city
which
was
closed
at
night
but
to
which
an
entry
and
the
subsequent
use
of
the
wire
would
present
little
difficulty
since
macvightie
had
finally
given
up
as
impossible
the
task
of
guarding
all
the
numerous
stations
of
that
description
on
the
division
yes
said
the
hawk
suddenly
under
his
breath
i
guess
go
a
long
way
to
get
their
hands
on
what
i
got
off
their
bat
and
i
guess
after
that
i
go
a
pricked
bubble
he
sucked
meditatively
at
his
brier
for
a
moment
then
a
mirthless
smile
parted
his
lips
and
he
spoke
again
forty
thousand
dollars
whispered
the
hawk
yes
i
guess
that
the
the
last
one
if
i
win
out
and
i
guess
i
will
this
is
where
the
curtain
drops
and
the
hawk
makes
his
for
parts
unknown
hawk
packs
his
valise
the
hawk
looked
at
his
watch
again
removed
his
feet
from
the
table
knocked
the
ashes
from
the
bowl
of
his
pipe
stood
up
and
crossed
leisurely
to
the
window
the
window
gave
on
the
fire
escape
he
lifted
aside
the
shade
and
stood
there
for
a
moment
staring
out
into
the
darkness
then
drew
the
shade
very
carefully
back
into
place
again
from
the
window
he
crossed
to
the
door
reassured
himself
that
it
was
locked
and
as
an
extra
precaution
draped
his
handkerchief
on
the
door
handle
completely
screening
the
keyhole
he
returned
now
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
and
from
under
the
bed
pulled
out
a
large
black
valise
he
laid
this
on
the
bed
and
opened
it
it
was
quite
empty
between
the
bed
and
the
table
stood
his
trunk
he
unlocked
the
trunk
and
threw
back
the
lid
it
quite
possible
muttered
the
hawk
as
his
fingers
worked
deftly
and
swiftly
around
the
edges
of
the
lid
that
i
may
not
return
i
forgotten
just
how
i
stand
on
my
rent
though
i
fancy
i
paid
up
for
a
week
in
advance
in
any
case
there
the
trunk
for
old
seidelberger
downstairs
and
likewise
its
contents
with
the
exception
scarcely
worth
this
there
was
a
grim
chuckle
on
the
hawk
lips
as
the
false
tray
came
away
in
his
hands
yes
said
the
hawk
as
he
laid
the
tray
on
the
bed
beside
the
valise
i
hardly
think
that
i
be
back
i
guess
they
pretty
peeved
as
it
is
and
after
i
a
notion
their
sentiments
are
going
to
improve
any
he
stood
looking
down
at
the
tray
that
bulged
to
repletion
with
the
proceeds
of
a
dozen
robberies
that
were
almost
in
fame
and
which
more
pertinent
still
as
far
as
the
hawk
was
concerned
represented
the
loot
that
the
wire
devils
had
already
counted
their
he
the
hawk
instead
had
helped
himself
to
the
prize
at
their
expense
the
hawk
began
to
transfer
the
contents
of
the
tray
to
the
valise
i
do
know
how
big
the
lot
would
size
up
but
it
looks
like
a
garden
villa
at
palm
is
going
some
observed
the
hawk
softly
yes
just
one
more
little
play
and
i
guess
i
retire
he
held
the
magnificent
diamond
necklace
up
to
the
light
causing
its
thousand
facets
to
leap
and
gleam
and
scintillate
in
fiery
flashes
then
laid
it
in
a
curiously
caressing
sort
of
way
in
the
bottom
of
the
valise
the
hawk
seemed
peculiarly
entranced
with
diamonds
as
though
in
their
touch
and
in
their
responsive
life
and
fire
he
found
a
pure
and
unalloyed
delight
from
their
little
box
he
allowed
the
score
or
two
of
unset
stones
to
trickle
into
the
palm
of
his
hand
and
again
he
brought
the
light
to
flash
and
play
upon
them
and
for
a
moment
he
held
them
a
sudden
hardness
set
his
jaws
and
lips
and
impulsively
he
thrust
the
stones
back
into
the
box
and
tossed
the
box
into
the
valise
damn
it
said
the
hawk
through
compressed
lips
they
make
me
think
of
the
old
mother
he
laughed
harshly
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
though
literally
to
throw
off
the
weight
of
an
unpleasant
reached
again
into
the
tray
he
worked
more
quickly
now
into
the
valise
he
packed
away
in
rapid
succession
a
very
large
collection
of
valuables
amongst
them
the
ten
thousand
dollars
in
banknotes
that
he
had
taken
from
the
paymaster
safe
the
contents
of
the
cash
box
amounting
to
some
three
thousand
dollars
of
which
he
had
once
relieved
one
isaac
kirschell
and
still
in
its
newspaper
wrapper
the
trader
national
bank
thousand
dollars
likewise
in
banknotes
which
had
been
his
last
venture
and
which
he
had
appropriated
on
the
night
he
had
been
wounded
the
tray
was
empty
now
save
for
a
black
mask
a
steel
jimmy
and
a
neat
little
package
of
crisp
new
counterfeit
notes
the
two
former
articles
the
hawk
laid
aside
on
the
table
and
the
latter
after
an
instant
hesitation
was
added
to
the
horde
in
the
valise
he
closed
and
locked
the
valise
there
remained
now
but
the
empty
tray
he
stared
at
this
ruefully
i
hate
to
lose
that
trunk
upon
my
soul
i
do
he
muttered
but
i
ca
afford
to
take
any
chances
of
spilling
the
beans
by
trying
to
get
it
out
of
here
he
took
out
his
knife
and
slashed
away
the
canvas
bottom
of
the
tray
then
broke
the
framework
into
a
dozen
pieces
the
lid
of
the
trunk
itself
was
innocent
of
fastenings
or
of
any
evidence
that
it
had
ever
concealed
a
tray
and
the
tray
itself
when
the
hawk
was
through
with
it
was
an
unrecognisable
debris
of
splintered
wood
and
ribbons
of
torn
canvas
he
made
a
bundle
of
this
tying
it
together
with
a
strip
of
the
canvas
the
hawk
now
emptied
his
pockets
and
proceeded
to
change
his
clothes
if
he
were
destined
to
sacrifice
the
greater
part
of
his
wardrobe
he
at
least
need
not
linger
long
in
indecision
over
the
choice
of
what
should
be
preserved
there
was
an
exceedingly
useful
and
ingeniously
devised
pocket
concealed
in
the
back
lining
of
a
certain
one
of
his
coats
the
suit
of
which
this
coat
was
an
integral
part
was
a
trifle
worn
and
threadbare
not
in
quite
as
good
repair
as
any
of
the
rest
of
his
clothing
and
for
that
reason
he
had
not
worn
it
of
late
but
one
could
not
at
all
times
afford
to
be
fastidious
what
he
left
behind
would
be
minutely
searched
and
examined
the
secret
of
that
pocket
a
little
invention
of
his
own
was
worth
preserving
from
the
vulgar
eye
even
at
the
expense
of
sacrificing
a
better
suit
of
clothes
for
the
sake
of
it
he
resurrected
the
suit
in
question
from
the
bottom
of
the
trunk
and
put
it
on
and
into
the
concealed
pocket
he
tucked
away
his
mask
and
his
bunch
of
skeleton
keys
a
side
coat
pocket
more
instantly
accessible
served
for
his
other
pockets
for
his
various
other
belongings
including
the
steel
jimmy
the
hawk
made
a
final
and
comprehensive
survey
of
the
room
then
closed
and
locked
the
trunk
and
again
consulted
his
watch
it
was
five
minutes
after
ten
and
no
scheduled
selkirk
at
the
hawk
nodded
it
was
time
to
time
he
took
from
his
pocket
his
automatic
tested
and
examined
its
mechanism
critically
and
restored
it
to
his
pocket
he
crossed
the
room
turned
out
the
light
unlocked
the
door
without
opening
it
and
took
his
handkerchief
from
the
keyhole
without
a
sound
now
the
hawk
moved
back
to
the
bed
picked
up
the
valise
tucked
the
bundle
of
what
had
once
been
the
tray
under
his
arm
returned
to
the
door
opened
it
silently
and
stood
peering
out
into
the
dark
the
next
instant
the
hawk
stealing
like
a
shadow
down
the
stairs
gained
the
street
and
in
another
had
swung
around
the
corner
into
the
lane
it
was
only
the
length
of
a
block
to
the
station
but
here
in
the
lane
the
hawk
found
means
of
disposing
of
the
irksome
bundle
under
his
arm
by
the
simple
expedient
of
dropping
pieces
of
the
wreckage
in
the
various
refuse
barrels
as
he
went
along
nor
had
the
hawk
evidently
any
intention
either
of
hampering
his
movements
with
the
care
of
the
valise
or
of
risking
the
valise
contents
in
the
night
work
that
lay
ahead
of
him
the
hawk
was
perhaps
possessed
of
a
certain
ironical
sense
of
humour
since
his
possession
of
the
loot
which
the
valise
contained
was
due
in
a
more
or
less
intimate
degree
to
the
railroad
it
seemed
eminently
fitting
that
it
should
be
restored
to
the
railroad
for
safekeeping
temporarily
the
hawk
as
he
entered
the
station
nonchalantly
exchanged
his
valise
for
a
check
paid
down
the
dime
for
the
service
to
be
rendered
and
passed
on
into
the
general
waiting
room
he
glanced
at
the
on
his
way
through
to
the
platform
its
full
complement
of
two
attendants
were
present
now
but
contrary
to
all
precedent
it
being
an
stand
obvious
preparations
for
closing
it
for
the
night
were
in
two
men
were
engaged
in
removing
the
magazines
newspapers
and
various
small
wares
from
the
outside
ledge
of
the
counter
and
in
pulling
down
the
large
sliding
windows
that
enclosed
the
place
the
hawk
dark
eyes
flashed
a
gleam
of
grim
appreciation
it
was
then
literally
a
mobilisation
of
the
wire
devils
to
the
last
man
a
half
million
in
a
half
million
in
gold
the
hawk
bought
a
mileage
book
in
lieu
of
a
ticket
to
any
specific
destination
both
because
his
immediate
destination
was
peculiarly
his
own
private
concern
and
because
in
the
very
near
future
he
expected
to
put
a
considerable
quantity
of
mileage
to
excellent
use
he
strolled
out
to
the
platform
and
along
to
the
east
end
of
the
station
here
quite
unobtrusively
he
awaited
the
arrival
of
no
the
platform
was
fairly
well
not
unusually
so
or
rather
perhaps
not
noticeably
so
a
half
dozen
or
even
a
dozen
extra
men
circulating
amongst
the
ordinary
press
of
traffic
would
hardly
be
expected
to
make
any
appreciable
difference
the
hawk
back
under
the
shadows
of
the
building
surveyed
the
lighted
stretch
of
platform
narrowly
they
were
there
the
wire
devils
reserve
he
knew
but
he
recognised
none
of
them
he
smiled
a
little
whimsically
his
acquaintanceship
with
the
gang
so
far
had
been
with
its
more
prominent
members
as
it
were
and
these
as
likewise
posse
had
already
boarded
the
train
far
west
of
each
might
not
excite
the
other
suspicion
nor
was
macvightie
himself
in
evidence
not
that
this
surprised
the
hawk
he
was
interested
that
was
all
it
was
simply
a
question
of
whether
macvightie
had
elected
to
stay
with
the
gold
or
had
gone
on
with
the
first
posse
on
the
limited
on
the
assumption
that
the
limited
was
the
more
likely
to
be
attacked
it
made
little
difference
of
course
as
far
as
he
the
hawk
was
concerned
whether
it
was
macvightie
or
some
one
else
who
was
in
command
of
the
own
plans
would
in
no
way
be
affected
on
that
account
there
was
a
stir
along
the
platform
up
the
yard
past
the
twinkling
switch
lights
on
the
spurs
the
glare
of
a
headlight
flashed
into
sight
around
the
bend
came
the
roar
and
rumble
of
a
heavy
train
and
a
moment
later
no
its
big
mogul
panting
like
a
thing
of
life
from
a
breathless
run
its
long
string
of
coaches
behind
it
rolled
into
the
station
the
hawk
did
not
stir
by
coincidence
perhaps
the
baggage
car
had
come
to
a
stop
directly
opposite
the
position
he
had
chosen
the
rearmost
sliding
door
of
the
car
was
slammed
back
and
the
baggageman
a
powerfully
built
muscular
fellow
of
perhaps
thirty
appeared
in
the
doorway
the
hawk
from
his
place
of
vantage
eyed
the
other
appraisingly
and
then
his
glance
travelled
on
into
the
interior
of
the
he
could
see
of
it
what
he
saw
was
a
mass
of
trunks
some
of
which
the
man
now
unloaded
on
the
waiting
trucks
and
in
turn
piled
others
as
they
were
heaved
up
to
him
from
the
platform
into
the
formers
places
the
hawk
nodded
his
head
shortly
true
the
forward
door
of
the
car
had
not
been
opened
but
had
done
his
work
well
there
was
no
hint
of
concealment
the
baggage
car
of
no
was
as
frankly
innocent
in
appearance
on
its
run
tonight
as
it
had
ever
been
the
train
was
starting
into
motion
again
when
the
hawk
finally
moved
he
crossed
the
platform
and
swung
himself
on
the
forward
steps
of
the
smoker
that
was
immediately
behind
the
baggage
car
his
slouch
hat
pulled
a
little
over
his
eyes
he
opened
the
door
stepped
into
the
car
sauntered
down
the
aisle
and
out
of
the
rear
door
to
the
vestibuled
platform
of
the
day
coach
behind
but
here
the
hawk
paused
a
moment
and
his
face
impassive
before
was
stamped
now
with
a
twisted
smile
his
reconnaissance
of
the
train
so
far
had
proved
fruitful
the
four
men
in
the
forward
double
seat
of
the
smoker
a
lap
board
across
their
knees
and
apparently
engrossed
in
their
card
game
were
the
butcher
whitie
jim
the
cricket
and
the
bantam
and
further
down
the
aisle
unwittingly
rubbing
shoulders
quite
probably
with
some
of
macvightie
men
parson
joe
occupied
a
seat
and
the
keen
pale
thin
face
of
kirschell
peered
out
from
another
yes
they
all
here
decided
the
hawk
his
voice
drowned
in
the
rattle
of
the
train
counting
those
who
got
on
at
selkirk
they
all
here
to
the
last
the
ladybird
and
his
wheel
chair
the
hawk
moved
forward
reached
out
for
the
handle
of
the
day
coach
sucked
in
his
breath
as
he
drew
sharply
back
again
through
the
glass
panel
he
had
caught
sight
of
two
men
he
had
not
expected
to
see
sitting
together
on
the
side
about
a
quarter
of
the
way
down
the
aisle
were
macvightie
and
lanson
the
hawk
frowned
he
had
waited
until
the
train
was
in
motion
and
he
had
not
seen
them
get
on
and
they
as
witness
that
little
conference
in
the
roundhouse
of
a
while
back
had
not
been
amongst
those
who
had
boarded
the
train
west
of
selkirk
and
then
the
frown
gave
place
to
a
sort
of
expression
where
were
his
wits
it
was
simple
enough
they
had
boarded
the
car
from
the
yard
side
of
the
train
and
not
from
the
platform
of
course
well
that
put
an
end
to
any
further
reconnaissance
through
the
train
in
one
sense
it
was
not
altogether
true
that
it
made
no
difference
whether
macvightie
was
aboard
or
not
he
and
macvightie
were
not
altogether
strangers
they
had
met
once
in
his
the
hawk
room
and
on
that
occasion
the
night
to
be
precise
he
had
cleaned
out
the
paymaster
safe
of
that
ten
thousand
dollars
macvightie
had
been
in
a
decidedly
suspicious
frame
of
mind
macvightie
it
was
quite
certain
had
not
forgotten
that
night
nor
it
was
quite
equally
safe
to
assume
had
macvightie
forgotten
his
the
hawk
at
that
exact
moment
the
hawk
had
no
desire
that
macvightie
should
recognise
him
again
the
hawk
turned
the
smoker
found
the
always
unpopular
crosswise
seat
behind
the
door
vacant
and
appropriated
it
his
eyes
straying
forward
over
the
car
located
two
more
acquaintances
in
the
person
of
crusty
kline
and
french
pete
and
came
back
to
fix
musingly
on
the
worn
nickel
faucet
of
the
no
first
stop
was
at
barne
junction
fifteen
miles
out
from
selkirk
and
some
five
miles
this
side
of
conmore
the
next
stop
was
lorraine
and
lorraine
was
on
the
other
fact
a
good
many
miles
on
the
other
echo
rock
and
the
willow
creek
bridge
the
deduction
was
obvious
and
the
hawk
destination
in
so
far
as
his
occupancy
of
a
seat
in
the
smoker
was
concerned
was
therefore
quite
junction
three
miles
east
of
echo
rock
repeated
the
hawk
to
himself
no
i
do
think
so
this
is
where
the
ladybird
has
another
guess
maybe
i
could
get
away
with
a
half
maybe
i
not
the
only
one
there
one
or
two
guys
in
this
car
that
got
the
to
my
lodge
it
seems
to
me
i
promised
the
butcher
something
the
night
he
tried
to
shoot
me
through
his
pocket
and
it
seems
as
though
i
promised
parson
joe
something
it
seems
to
me
i
did
of
a
feather
it
took
twenty
minutes
for
the
run
to
the
junction
and
at
the
junction
as
far
as
the
hawk
could
tell
since
yielding
to
what
had
become
a
sort
of
habit
with
him
he
descended
to
the
ground
on
the
opposite
side
from
the
station
he
was
the
only
passenger
for
that
stop
it
was
dark
here
strangely
silent
and
strangely
lonely
barne
junction
owed
its
existence
neither
to
a
town
site
nor
to
commercial
existed
simply
as
a
junction
and
for
purely
railroad
operating
purposes
only
it
was
in
fact
the
other
extreme
as
compared
to
selkirk
with
its
lighted
and
busy
platform
its
extensive
yard
and
its
ubiquitous
and
perhaps
too
inquisitive
yardmen
the
hawk
dropped
on
all
fours
and
began
to
creep
along
the
side
of
the
smoker
toward
the
forward
end
of
the
train
his
eyes
strained
warily
through
the
darkness
against
the
possibility
of
one
or
other
of
the
engine
crew
descending
from
the
cab
he
passed
the
smoker
and
kept
on
along
the
length
of
the
baggage
car
still
crawling
moving
without
a
sound
when
he
rose
from
his
knees
finally
he
was
crouched
down
in
between
the
tender
and
the
forward
end
of
the
baggage
car
and
a
moment
later
as
the
train
jerked
forward
into
motion
he
was
crouched
time
on
the
end
beam
of
the
baggage
car
which
in
lieu
of
platform
served
as
a
sort
of
wide
threshold
for
the
door
the
train
was
beginning
to
gain
momentum
now
and
against
the
jolt
and
swing
of
the
increasing
speed
the
hawk
steadied
himself
by
clinging
with
one
hand
to
the
iron
handrail
at
the
side
of
the
the
other
hand
he
tried
the
door
cautiously
and
found
it
locked
from
the
pocket
in
the
back
lining
of
his
coat
he
produced
his
mask
fingered
it
speculatively
for
an
instant
then
slipped
it
over
his
face
true
this
was
to
be
his
last
venture
in
the
wire
devils
preserves
but
he
had
always
worn
a
mask
came
a
twisted
perhaps
would
not
recognise
him
without
it
and
it
was
quite
necessary
that
they
should
recognise
the
he
was
to
keep
that
promise
to
the
butcher
it
might
be
a
farewell
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
but
he
intended
that
it
should
be
a
memorable
one
and
that
no
doubt
should
be
permitted
to
linger
in
their
minds
as
to
the
identity
of
the
parting
guest
they
had
so
lavishly
if
ungraciously
entertained
from
the
same
pocket
came
his
skeleton
keys
the
hawk
now
felt
tentatively
with
his
finger
over
the
keyhole
nodded
his
head
briskly
and
from
the
bunch
of
keys
still
by
the
sense
of
touch
selected
one
without
hesitation
the
hawk
however
for
the
moment
made
no
effort
to
open
the
door
the
rush
of
the
wind
was
in
his
face
now
like
some
black
monstrous
uncanny
wall
confronting
him
the
tender
clashed
and
clattered
and
swayed
in
dizzy
lurches
before
his
eyes
while
heavenward
the
sky
was
tinged
with
a
deep
red
glow
and
the
cab
was
ablaze
with
light
from
the
door
and
the
top
of
the
baggage
car
door
and
the
individual
particles
of
coal
on
the
top
of
the
heap
stood
out
in
sharp
relief
against
the
background
of
the
night
and
then
the
darkness
fell
again
the
hawk
hand
shot
forward
to
the
keyhole
lingered
there
an
instant
as
he
crouched
again
swaying
with
the
lurch
of
the
train
then
the
skeleton
keys
were
returned
to
the
pocket
in
the
back
lining
of
his
the
hawk
was
in
action
in
a
flash
he
had
opened
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
with
his
back
against
it
his
automatic
flung
significantly
forward
in
his
hand
he
stood
staring
down
the
length
of
the
car
there
was
a
hoarse
startled
yell
that
was
lost
in
the
roar
of
the
flying
train
and
the
baggageman
from
his
chair
at
one
side
of
the
car
and
in
front
of
a
desk
topped
with
a
rack
of
pigeonholes
leaped
to
his
feet
sit
down
invited
the
hawk
coldly
the
man
hesitated
but
the
next
instant
dropped
back
into
his
chair
as
the
hawk
moved
suddenly
forward
to
his
side
what
do
you
want
he
demanded
sullenly
begin
with
the
hawk
voice
was
an
insolent
drawl
now
as
his
deft
fingers
like
a
streak
of
lightning
were
into
the
other
pocket
and
out
again
with
the
man
revolver
how
long
since
they
been
arming
the
baggagemen
on
this
road
you
only
talking
to
myself
those
are
the
cases
up
there
by
the
forward
door
are
they
and
the
big
one
got
the
green
he
was
backing
away
from
the
man
now
do
move
my
that
chair
you
sitting
in
is
the
only
health
resort
in
this
car
the
man
hands
clenched
as
his
eyes
narrowed
on
the
hawk
you
damned
thief
he
rasped
out
like
quite
so
said
the
hawk
softly
i
know
how
you
feel
about
it
and
if
it
helps
any
to
get
it
off
your
chest
go
to
it
nobody
hear
you
but
me
and
i
try
and
make
the
best
of
it
piled
along
the
side
of
the
car
from
the
doorway
were
a
number
of
solidly
made
cases
that
obviously
contained
the
gold
shipment
in
front
of
these
between
them
and
where
the
baggageman
sat
and
acting
too
perhaps
as
a
screen
when
the
rear
sliding
door
was
open
as
for
instance
it
had
been
at
selkirk
was
a
large
packing
case
the
hawk
beside
this
now
moved
it
slightly
it
was
very
light
so
light
as
to
warrant
the
presumption
that
it
might
even
be
empty
the
baggageman
had
relapsed
into
a
scowling
silence
his
eyes
still
on
the
hawk
the
hawk
took
his
steel
jimmy
from
his
pocket
shifted
his
automatic
to
his
left
hand
and
inserted
the
jimmy
under
the
cover
of
the
case
there
was
a
rip
and
tear
of
rending
wood
the
operation
was
twice
the
hawk
threw
the
shattered
cover
on
the
floor
he
glanced
inside
at
the
bottom
of
the
case
lay
a
large
paper
package
strongly
tied
and
heavily
sealed
with
red
wax
under
his
mask
the
hawk
lips
parted
in
a
smile
as
his
eyes
on
the
baggageman
again
he
noted
that
the
other
was
watching
his
every
movement
now
with
a
sort
of
intense
expectancy
the
hawk
however
made
no
effort
to
reach
down
into
the
depth
of
the
packing
case
he
canted
the
box
over
and
picked
up
the
package
from
the
floor
of
the
car
with
the
point
of
his
jimmy
he
tore
a
rent
in
the
paper
his
smile
broadened
i
apologise
said
the
hawk
with
an
engaging
nod
to
the
sullen
figure
in
the
chair
they
not
green
yellow
backs
you
damned
thief
said
the
man
in
a
choked
voice
the
roar
and
sway
of
the
train
seemed
suddenly
to
increase
as
the
wheel
trucks
jolting
and
beating
at
a
siding
switch
set
up
a
sort
of
infernal
tattoo
they
were
passing
the
first
station
after
the
the
smile
left
the
hawk
face
a
little
further
along
and
they
would
stop
the
train
there
came
a
sort
of
set
to
the
clamped
jaws
he
was
taking
chances
but
he
had
already
weighed
those
chances
well
the
wire
devils
the
butcher
and
his
crowd
would
be
on
the
alert
but
equally
so
would
be
the
posse
that
must
far
outnumber
the
gang
and
there
was
that
promise
to
the
butcher
with
their
plans
awry
and
taken
by
surprise
instead
of
profiting
by
surprise
themselves
their
chances
rather
than
of
securing
a
half
million
in
gold
were
most
excellent
of
securing
quite
as
generous
a
reward
though
of
another
the
hands
of
macvightie
i
going
to
get
off
here
said
the
hawk
coolly
to
the
figure
in
the
chair
and
the
only
way
to
get
off
without
cracking
my
bean
is
to
let
that
guy
there
in
the
engine
know
that
he
infringing
the
speed
laws
you
remember
what
i
told
only
healthy
place
in
this
car
for
you
is
where
you
sitting
now
something
may
crack
loose
around
out
of
the
wet
the
hawk
reached
above
his
head
for
the
bell
cord
and
pulled
it
sharply
the
engine
crew
too
were
evidently
on
the
alert
the
shrill
blast
of
the
whistle
answered
the
signal
instantly
there
was
a
sudden
jerk
that
almost
threw
the
hawk
from
his
feet
the
pound
and
slam
of
buffer
plates
and
the
vicious
shriek
of
the
the
hawk
recovered
himself
and
cool
and
quick
in
every
movement
now
thrust
his
jimmy
into
his
pocket
to
free
his
hands
flung
the
package
of
banknotes
up
the
aisle
made
by
trunks
and
boxes
behind
him
and
began
to
retreat
toward
the
forward
door
pulling
the
empty
case
along
as
a
shield
between
himself
and
the
other
end
of
the
car
the
rear
door
of
the
car
smashed
inward
the
hawk
caught
a
blurred
glimpse
of
faces
and
forms
surging
through
the
doorway
and
streaming
across
the
platform
from
the
smoker
in
the
lead
the
butcher
crafty
face
with
its
little
black
restless
ferret
eyes
fixed
down
the
aisle
of
the
car
on
him
the
hawk
came
in
a
scream
of
abandoned
fury
from
the
a
headlong
flash
the
roar
of
the
report
as
the
butcher
as
the
hawk
automatic
the
spat
of
a
bullet
splitting
the
panel
of
the
forward
door
the
hawk
stooped
low
behind
the
packing
case
now
still
edged
backward
toward
the
door
still
dragging
the
case
after
him
a
smile
that
was
deadly
grim
and
far
removed
from
mirth
curved
his
lips
downward
in
hard
merciless
lines
he
had
at
least
attained
his
object
there
was
no
doubt
concerning
their
recognition
of
him
as
the
hawk
well
he
had
weighed
the
chances
they
would
be
on
him
now
but
only
one
at
a
time
there
was
not
room
for
more
with
the
packing
case
blocking
the
it
would
be
the
butcher
first
after
after
that
he
counted
on
macvightie
creating
a
diversion
from
the
rear
the
butcher
had
flung
himself
against
the
packing
case
it
toppled
to
one
side
and
the
hawk
like
a
crouched
tiger
sprang
and
closed
making
of
the
butcher
body
as
a
substitute
for
the
packing
case
now
a
shield
from
the
onrush
behind
there
was
a
furious
oath
from
the
butcher
a
lurch
a
stagger
as
the
train
jerked
and
jerked
both
men
gripped
and
locked
together
went
to
the
floor
for
an
instant
they
rolled
over
and
over
the
butcher
snarling
like
a
mad
beast
wrenching
and
twisting
for
an
opening
at
the
then
suddenly
the
car
was
in
an
inferno
a
voice
macvightie
rang
out
sternly
from
the
rear
door
it
was
echoed
by
a
yell
from
one
of
the
hawk
companions
then
a
shot
another
a
fusillade
of
then
a
voice
above
the
uproar
it
macvightie
an
de
bulls
there
was
a
scurrying
of
feet
a
stampede
for
cover
behind
trunks
and
boxes
by
the
butcher
the
butcher
grip
was
tense
upon
the
hawk
cut
it
out
he
whispered
hoarsely
my
god
lot
of
us
make
a
break
for
the
me
the
only
chance
blue
eddies
of
smoke
hung
in
queer
wavering
hesitant
suspension
up
and
down
the
length
of
the
car
the
air
was
full
of
the
acrid
smell
of
powder
the
firing
broke
out
again
the
hawk
released
his
hold
all
right
he
panted
i
with
you
the
butcher
was
right
it
was
the
only
a
chance
that
was
theirs
alone
for
as
they
lay
on
the
floor
the
packing
case
hid
them
and
it
was
barely
two
yards
to
the
door
the
train
was
almost
at
a
standstill
now
macvightie
men
had
gained
an
entrance
and
a
position
for
themselves
behind
the
trunks
at
the
lower
end
firing
as
they
crept
forward
while
back
on
the
smoker
platform
through
the
baggage
car
open
door
others
commanded
the
sweep
down
the
center
of
the
car
the
hawk
snatched
at
the
package
of
banknotes
snuggled
it
under
his
coat
and
with
the
butcher
beside
him
began
to
wriggle
toward
the
door
macvightie
voice
rang
out
again
from
the
rear
of
the
car
marston
take
ten
men
and
surround
the
car
his
voice
rose
suddenly
in
a
roar
the
forward
door
of
them
watch
which
way
they
a
man
of
them
gets
away
quick
the
hawk
had
wrenched
the
door
open
and
with
the
butcher
behind
him
flung
himself
out
and
leaped
to
the
ground
with
the
hawk
leading
running
like
hares
the
two
men
dashed
down
the
embankment
and
hurled
themselves
over
the
fence
that
enclosed
the
right
of
way
shouts
the
crackle
of
shots
echoed
from
behind
short
vicious
of
the
revolvers
a
myriad
of
them
it
seemed
stabbed
yellow
through
the
blackness
the
hawk
glanced
back
over
his
shoulder
he
could
just
make
out
perhaps
a
half
dozen
dark
forms
in
perhaps
fifty
yards
away
the
darkness
and
the
distance
made
the
shooting
at
best
uncertain
it
was
only
a
chance
shot
that
would
get
either
the
butcher
or
himself
and
ahead
unless
he
was
mistaken
for
the
train
must
have
come
to
a
stop
at
just
about
that
distance
from
conmore
must
be
the
wooded
tract
of
land
that
surrounded
the
old
farmhouse
it
was
the
old
set
clamped
his
jaws
again
yes
and
so
was
the
well
it
was
obvious
enough
that
there
was
no
other
cover
he
glanced
at
the
butcher
face
that
he
could
just
discern
in
the
darkness
the
butcher
might
decide
against
it
but
the
butcher
evidently
had
not
recognised
his
surroundings
the
man
lips
were
working
and
he
was
cursing
in
abandon
as
he
ran
the
hawk
spoke
in
short
gasping
breaths
there
some
trees
over
the
for
the
butcher
swerved
automatically
in
the
direction
indicated
curse
you
he
wheezed
out
this
is
all
your
infernal
nosey
work
what
did
you
want
to
butt
in
for
could
have
got
that
gold
anyway
you
close
your
face
snapped
back
the
hawk
i
running
my
own
show
there
was
a
little
thousand
bucks
along
with
that
gold
that
maybe
you
did
know
about
that
what
i
was
and
that
what
i
yes
butcher
voice
broke
in
infuriated
yes
and
you
got
them
all
pinched
every
last
one
of
you
you
save
your
breath
and
put
it
into
running
retorted
the
hawk
savagely
or
else
maybe
you
get
pinched
yourself
it
their
lookout
i
do
owe
any
of
you
any
candy
do
i
macvightie
himself
was
evidently
one
of
those
in
pursuit
behind
for
again
the
hawk
recognised
the
other
voice
spread
out
there
to
the
right
and
try
and
shoot
a
little
they
get
into
that
belt
of
trees
a
renewed
outburst
of
firing
came
in
the
hawk
measured
grimly
the
few
yards
that
still
separated
him
from
the
trees
as
a
bullet
drumming
the
air
venomously
seemed
to
miss
his
cheek
by
but
the
fraction
of
an
inch
macvightie
presence
was
evidence
that
the
detective
was
so
well
satisfied
that
the
gang
penned
up
in
the
car
could
not
escape
that
he
obviously
counted
his
temporary
absence
from
the
scene
well
warranted
if
thereby
the
were
made
complete
in
the
capture
hawk
mental
soliloquy
came
to
an
abrupt
end
there
was
a
low
cry
from
the
butcher
and
the
man
as
they
ran
shoulder
to
shoulder
lurched
against
him
what
wrong
flung
out
the
hawk
sharply
they
got
me
gasped
the
lurched
again
they
got
the
the
hawk
glanced
backward
again
they
were
still
those
fifty
yards
behind
those
dark
flitting
oncoming
forms
those
vicious
yellow
stabs
of
flame
in
the
had
been
a
dead
heat
so
far
here
to
the
fringe
of
the
trees
the
butcher
stumbled
the
hawk
swung
his
free
arm
around
the
waist
and
plunged
in
amongst
the
trees
it
was
slower
work
now
desperately
slow
he
clutched
at
the
package
of
banknotes
beneath
his
coat
and
with
his
other
hand
tightened
his
grip
upon
the
butcher
the
man
was
evidently
badly
hit
and
was
beginning
to
sag
limply
came
the
thrashing
and
branches
and
the
rush
of
feet
behind
them
the
fifty
yards
was
ten
hawk
with
his
burden
struggled
then
there
came
a
cry
again
from
the
had
gained
the
edge
of
the
clearing
and
the
old
farmhouse
and
its
outbuildings
loomed
up
before
them
the
butcher
voice
choked
weakly
know
where
we
god
quick
they
search
the
house
i
got
to
warn
him
the
man
as
though
under
a
stimulant
with
new
strength
had
sprung
forward
alone
into
the
clear
making
for
the
farmhouse
door
it
was
only
a
few
yards
but
halfway
there
he
stumbled
again
the
hawk
pulled
him
to
his
feet
a
yell
went
up
behind
them
macvightie
and
his
men
too
were
now
in
the
clearing
and
the
ten
yards
lead
was
cut
to
five
to
then
the
door
before
them
was
flung
suddenly
open
and
a
voice
challenged
hoarsely
from
within
who
there
the
butcher
pitched
across
the
threshold
dragging
the
hawk
down
with
him
in
his
fall
the
door
it
screamed
the
butcher
cellar
the
hawk
had
leaped
to
his
feet
the
room
was
dark
unlighted
but
from
across
it
came
as
there
had
come
that
other
night
the
faint
glow
from
the
open
door
of
the
cellarway
the
butcher
had
staggered
up
again
and
was
making
in
that
then
the
hawk
too
was
across
the
the
next
instant
turning
to
meet
the
rush
from
without
as
the
front
door
evidently
before
the
man
whom
the
butcher
had
addressed
as
jim
could
fasten
it
burst
inward
and
crashed
against
the
wall
he
was
borne
backward
and
losing
his
balance
half
pitched
half
rolled
down
the
cellar
stairs
the
fall
must
have
stunned
him
for
a
moment
he
realised
that
as
he
struggled
to
his
find
himself
staring
into
the
muzzle
of
macvightie
revolver
and
to
find
that
the
bulging
package
of
banknotes
was
gone
from
under
his
coat
as
too
were
his
automatic
his
jimmy
and
the
baggageman
revolver
that
had
been
in
the
side
pockets
of
his
coat
he
raised
his
hand
dazedly
toward
his
macvightie
reaching
out
knocked
his
hand
away
i
do
that
for
were
just
getting
around
to
it
said
macvightie
jerked
the
hawk
mask
from
his
face
and
then
macvightie
leaned
sharply
forward
he
exclaimed
grimly
so
it
it
i
guess
you
put
it
over
me
the
night
that
ten
thousand
was
lifted
at
the
i
got
you
now
the
hawk
made
no
answer
he
was
staring
still
in
an
apparently
dazed
way
about
him
the
cellar
was
a
veritable
maze
of
work
benches
and
elaborate
counterfeiting
work
a
printing
press
stood
over
in
one
corner
on
the
benches
plates
and
engravers
tools
of
all
descriptions
were
scattered
about
and
near
the
wall
by
the
stairway
he
made
out
a
telegraph
set
but
the
hawk
glance
did
not
linger
on
any
of
these
fastened
on
a
bent
and
twisted
form
that
craned
its
neck
forward
from
a
wheel
chair
on
a
livid
face
out
of
which
the
eyes
narrowed
to
slits
smouldered
in
deadly
menace
and
from
whose
thin
lips
that
scarcely
moved
there
poured
forth
now
a
torrent
of
hideous
blasphemy
in
that
soft
silken
voice
that
had
earned
the
ladybird
his
name
on
the
hand
crooked
into
a
claw
that
pushing
away
the
man
who
stood
guard
over
him
reached
out
toward
where
the
butcher
lay
upon
the
floor
you
ape
you
gnat
you
brainless
pig
and
you
led
them
i
did
know
where
i
was
until
i
was
right
on
the
house
mumbled
the
butcher
miserably
shut
of
you
ordered
macvightie
gruffly
what
do
you
say
lanson
is
this
the
hawk
the
hawk
had
not
seen
the
superintendent
and
he
turned
now
quickly
lanson
eyes
were
boring
into
him
coldly
yes
said
lanson
evenly
i
think
i
could
swear
he
was
the
man
who
held
us
up
in
the
private
car
the
other
it
easily
proved
if
he
is
the
hawk
he
has
got
a
wound
in
his
right
side
i
saw
him
clap
his
hand
there
when
the
pistol
went
off
in
his
fight
with
well
we
soon
see
snapped
macvightie
the
hawk
licked
his
lips
you
need
look
he
said
morosely
it
so
you
admit
it
do
you
macvightie
smile
was
unpleasant
well
then
since
you
seem
to
be
so
thick
with
that
pack
of
curs
back
there
in
the
train
perhaps
you
admit
to
a
hand
in
this
little
counterfeiting
plant
as
well
no
i
wo
said
the
hawk
shortly
i
never
had
anything
to
do
with
this
i
do
admit
anything
of
the
kind
ask
him
hawk
jerked
his
hand
toward
the
ladybird
oh
all
right
macvightie
smiled
unpleasantly
again
let
it
go
at
that
for
now
if
you
like
it
that
way
it
does
much
matter
you
birds
of
a
feather
anyway
and
there
enough
on
all
of
you
to
go
around
he
reached
behind
him
and
picked
up
the
package
of
banknotes
from
where
he
had
evidently
laid
it
on
the
nearest
bench
how
did
you
know
this
was
on
the
train
and
how
did
you
know
where
it
was
in
the
tell
the
truth
about
it
i
heard
you
and
lanson
talking
about
it
tonight
said
the
hawk
where
in
the
roundhouse
i
was
outside
the
window
and
voice
thinned
in
a
sudden
you
go
to
the
devil
with
your
questions
the
ladybird
was
craned
forward
again
in
the
wheel
chair
listening
intently
he
sank
back
now
and
scowled
murderously
at
the
hawk
macvightie
shrugged
his
shoulders
handed
the
package
to
one
of
his
three
men
who
were
with
him
in
the
cellar
and
drew
a
pair
of
handcuffs
from
his
pocket
get
that
cash
down
to
the
train
and
put
it
back
with
the
gold
where
it
will
be
under
guard
macgregor
he
ordered
brusquely
and
you
two
carry
this
fellow
rattled
his
handcuffs
in
the
down
there
too
tell
marston
to
let
you
have
three
or
four
more
men
the
chap
that
williams
has
got
upstairs
there
will
have
to
be
carried
too
i
guess
and
our
friend
here
in
the
invalid
buggy
with
the
thanksgiving
expression
on
his
face
will
have
to
have
somebody
to
push
him
along
over
the
ruts
yes
and
i
want
a
couple
to
put
in
the
night
marston
to
make
it
four
and
now
beat
it
you
run
ahead
macgregor
and
get
back
as
soon
as
you
do
want
to
tie
up
the
traffic
all
night
the
two
men
picked
up
the
butcher
and
preceded
by
their
companion
with
the
package
of
banknotes
went
up
the
stairs
macvightie
caught
the
hawk
arm
roughly
snapped
one
link
of
the
steel
cuffs
over
the
hawk
right
wrist
and
yanked
the
hawk
ungently
over
to
a
position
beside
the
wheel
chair
he
snapped
the
other
link
over
the
ladybird
left
wrist
and
smiled
menacingly
i
guess
there
dead
weight
enough
there
to
anchor
you
for
a
few
minutes
while
i
take
a
look
around
here
he
said
turned
to
the
hawk
was
licking
at
his
lips
again
upstairs
the
tramp
of
feet
was
dying
away
there
would
be
no
one
there
now
but
the
other
member
of
the
gang
who
it
seemed
had
been
hurt
when
the
house
was
rushed
and
the
one
man
who
was
guarding
the
prisoner
the
ladybird
cultured
voice
at
the
hawk
side
poured
out
an
uninterrupted
stream
of
abandoned
oaths
that
were
like
a
shudder
in
the
nonchalant
conversational
tones
in
which
they
fell
from
the
twitching
lips
macvightie
and
lanson
were
moving
here
and
there
about
the
place
snatches
of
their
conversation
reached
the
hawk
well
i
reckon
i
called
the
turn
all
right
when
i
said
it
was
the
same
crowd
that
was
turning
out
the
phony
stuff
eh
yes
the
telegraph
set
ca
trace
the
wires
until
daylight
of
course
sure
a
the
hawk
eyes
travelled
furtively
around
the
cellar
they
rested
hungrily
on
a
spot
in
front
of
him
where
in
the
centre
of
the
floor
but
partially
hidden
by
one
of
the
workbenches
was
the
bolted
trapdoor
of
the
underground
passage
that
led
out
to
the
wagon
shed
he
circled
his
lips
with
his
tongue
again
and
furtively
again
his
glance
travelled
the
door
at
the
head
of
the
cellar
stairs
that
had
a
massive
bolt
and
that
evidently
swinging
back
of
its
own
accord
after
the
men
had
passed
through
now
hung
just
a
long
narrow
window
most
tantalising
of
all
because
it
was
wide
open
that
was
shoulder
high
just
above
the
stonework
of
the
cellar
and
evidently
on
a
level
with
the
ground
outside
and
then
suddenly
the
hawk
lids
hide
a
quick
flash
and
gleam
that
lighted
the
dark
eyes
macvightie
had
stooped
and
throwing
back
the
bolt
had
lifted
up
the
trapdoor
hello
he
ejaculated
what
this
here
lanson
it
looks
like
a
passage
of
some
he
was
leaning
down
into
the
opening
yes
so
help
me
that
what
it
is
he
lowered
himself
hurriedly
through
the
trapdoor
and
his
voice
came
back
muffled
into
the
cellar
come
down
here
a
minute
lanson
they
certainly
had
things
worked
out
to
a
fine
point
lanson
back
as
following
macvightie
he
lowered
himself
through
the
opening
was
turned
to
the
in
a
flash
the
hawk
free
hand
had
swept
behind
him
under
his
coat
to
the
concealed
pocket
in
the
back
lining
and
his
eyes
were
thrust
within
an
inch
of
the
as
he
lowered
his
head
you
understand
hawk
lips
did
not
move
he
was
breathing
his
words
while
a
skeleton
key
worked
swiftly
at
the
handcuff
on
his
you
understand
it
you
or
me
you
make
a
sound
to
queer
me
and
i
get
the
livid
face
was
contorted
working
with
impotent
fury
but
perhaps
for
the
first
time
that
it
had
ever
been
there
there
was
fear
in
the
ladybird
burning
eyes
the
hawk
hand
was
free
now
shoulders
were
just
disappearing
through
the
opening
and
with
a
lightning
spring
the
hawk
reached
the
trapdoor
swung
it
down
bolted
it
and
running
without
a
sound
gained
the
head
of
the
cellar
stairs
pulled
the
door
gently
shut
slid
the
bolt
silently
into
the
next
moment
the
hawk
returning
darted
to
the
window
swung
himself
up
to
the
ledge
and
vanished
confidential
correspondence
two
days
later
macvightie
received
a
letter
that
had
been
posted
the
day
before
from
a
city
quite
a
number
of
miles
nearer
the
east
than
selkirk
was
in
the
lower
corner
of
the
envelope
heavily
underscored
was
the
word
what
macvightie
read
when
he
opened
the
letter
was
this
dear
macvightie
i
feel
that
you
are
entitled
to
an
will
not
call
it
an
apology
for
i
am
sure
you
will
recognise
with
me
the
unavoidable
nature
of
the
circumstances
existing
at
the
my
somewhat
informal
of
you
two
evenings
ago
and
i
am
afraid
that
my
actions
on
that
occasion
have
not
enhanced
your
opinion
hawk
i
shall
try
and
redeem
myself
you
have
i
make
no
doubt
already
searched
that
room
where
i
first
had
the
pleasure
of
making
your
have
found
nothing
let
me
begin
then
by
saying
that
the
diamond
necklace
belonging
to
his
excellency
the
wife
a
certain
shipment
of
unset
stones
and
cash
in
varying
amounts
derived
from
sources
with
which
you
are
acquainted
are
in
a
black
valise
which
you
will
find
in
the
parcel
room
of
the
selkirk
for
which
i
enclose
herewith
the
check
i
imagine
that
you
are
sceptical
i
wonder
then
if
it
would
also
occasion
you
surprise
to
know
that
birks
of
the
secret
service
was
after
all
deck
the
night
that
the
wire
devils
fell
into
your
hospitable
hands
yes
it
is
quite
am
birks
the
newspaper
biographies
of
the
hawk
the
apparent
authenticity
of
his
prison
record
and
release
from
sing
sing
was
but
fiction
supplied
from
sources
the
east
was
being
swamped
with
one
of
the
cleverest
counterfeit
notes
that
the
federal
authorities
popularly
called
the
secret
service
had
ever
had
to
deal
with
and
it
was
evident
at
once
that
the
gang
at
work
possessed
an
organisation
against
which
ordinary
methods
would
be
of
no
avail
facts
in
the
possession
of
the
federal
authorities
indicated
that
the
headquarters
of
the
gang
was
in
the
west
and
indeed
as
you
later
concluded
yourself
that
the
wire
devils
who
were
just
beginning
to
operate
over
the
wires
around
selkirk
were
the
men
we
wanted
that
because
of
my
knowledge
of
telegraphy
i
was
detailed
to
the
case
and
how
almost
at
the
outset
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
secure
the
key
to
their
cipher
need
not
be
gone
into
here
knowing
their
code
then
it
would
have
been
a
simple
enough
matter
to
have
run
one
or
two
of
them
to
earth
at
almost
any
time
but
that
was
not
enough
it
was
necessary
that
the
entire
organisation
and
especially
its
head
should
be
caught
the
rôle
of
the
hawk
furnished
the
solution
to
the
problem
it
enabled
me
to
frustrate
their
plans
while
at
the
same
time
i
was
working
on
the
case
and
it
enabled
me
to
do
this
without
arousing
their
suspicions
that
the
secret
service
was
on
the
track
of
their
counterfeiting
plant
of
a
feather
you
called
us
and
of
a
feather
i
am
going
to
ask
you
to
allow
us
in
the
public
eyes
and
particularly
in
the
eyes
of
those
you
now
have
behind
the
bars
to
remain
i
am
sure
you
will
readily
acquiesce
in
this
you
will
instantly
see
that
my
usefulness
would
be
destroyed
if
the
hawk
became
known
and
recognised
as
birks
of
the
secret
service
by
every
crook
in
the
country
as
would
result
if
he
now
figured
in
the
case
in
his
proper
person
and
this
leads
to
a
word
of
explanation
in
reference
to
the
final
act
in
our
little
drama
of
two
nights
ago
i
had
discovered
the
headquarters
of
the
gang
and
i
had
found
that
cleverest
of
unhung
crooks
the
ladybird
to
be
in
command
the
plan
outlined
to
you
from
washington
was
at
my
suggestion
and
was
simply
a
trap
to
collect
them
all
into
one
net
a
trap
i
might
add
which
they
walked
into
as
they
believed
with
their
eyes
wide
open
for
they
were
well
aware
of
every
move
you
had
made
the
purpose
of
the
money
in
banknotes
accompanying
the
gold
shipment
was
to
supply
the
hawk
with
a
reason
for
his
appearance
on
the
scene
it
was
not
altogether
a
question
of
coincidence
that
the
train
was
stopped
just
outside
nor
that
the
chase
led
you
to
the
farmhouse
and
the
ladybird
the
rest
you
know
it
was
necessary
that
i
should
be
captured
and
arrested
in
their
presence
be
caught
in
fact
with
the
and
also
that
my
escape
should
in
their
eyes
appear
equally
genuine
if
i
was
to
preserve
the
hawk
identity
as
for
this
last
point
things
turned
out
a
little
differently
than
i
had
planned
for
i
had
expected
to
be
taken
to
jail
with
the
common
herd
and
there
had
intended
to
arrange
some
sort
of
an
escape
to
keep
up
appearances
as
it
turned
out
however
i
am
sure
you
will
agree
with
me
that
there
are
worse
things
at
times
than
a
trapdoor
in
a
cellar
floor
i
think
that
is
for
one
little
detail
i
would
suggest
that
you
account
for
the
recovery
of
the
and
the
black
valise
through
the
fact
that
dissatisfied
with
your
first
search
of
that
room
over
our
friend
saloon
you
searched
it
again
more
minutely
found
a
check
ingeniously
hidden
say
behind
the
wall
bracket
of
the
by
so
doing
permit
me
to
remain
ever
and
most
sincerely
yours
the
the
end
