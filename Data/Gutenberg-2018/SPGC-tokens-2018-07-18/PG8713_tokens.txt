of
cautious
disposition
and
an
eye
to
the
main
chance
receives
from
an
eminent
firm
of
an
extremely
large
order
for
his
emotions
are
mixed
joy
may
be
said
to
predominate
but
with
the
joy
comes
also
uncertainty
are
these
people
he
asks
himself
proposing
to
set
up
as
farmers
of
a
large
scale
or
do
they
merely
want
the
seed
to
give
verisimilitude
to
their
otherwise
bald
and
unconvincing
raspberry
jam
on
the
solution
of
this
problem
depends
the
important
matter
of
price
for
obviously
you
can
charge
a
fraudulent
jam
disseminator
in
a
manner
which
an
honest
farmer
would
resent
this
was
the
problem
which
was
furrowing
the
brow
of
julian
fineberg
of
bury
edwards
one
sunny
morning
when
roland
bleke
knocked
at
his
door
and
such
was
its
difficulty
that
only
at
the
nineteenth
knock
did
fineberg
raise
his
head
come
in
that
dashed
woodpecker
out
there
he
shouted
for
it
was
his
habit
to
express
himself
with
a
generous
strength
towards
the
junior
members
of
his
staff
the
young
man
who
entered
looked
exactly
like
a
second
clerk
in
a
provincial
office
which
strangely
enough
he
chanced
to
be
his
chief
characteristic
was
an
intense
ordinariness
he
was
a
young
man
and
when
you
had
said
that
of
him
you
had
said
everything
there
was
nothing
which
you
would
have
noticed
about
him
except
the
fact
that
there
was
nothing
to
notice
his
age
was
and
his
name
was
roland
bleke
please
sir
it
about
my
fineberg
at
the
word
drew
himself
together
much
as
a
british
square
at
waterloo
must
have
drawn
itself
together
at
the
sight
of
a
squadron
of
cuirassiers
salary
he
cried
what
about
it
what
the
matter
with
it
you
get
it
do
you
yes
sir
but
well
do
stand
there
like
an
idiot
what
is
it
it
too
fineberg
brain
reeled
it
was
improbable
that
the
millennium
could
have
arrived
with
a
jerk
on
the
other
hand
he
had
distinctly
heard
one
of
his
clerks
complain
that
his
salary
was
too
large
he
pinched
himself
say
that
again
he
said
if
you
could
see
your
way
to
reduce
it
sir
it
occurred
to
fineberg
for
one
instant
that
his
subordinate
was
endeavoring
to
be
humorous
but
a
glance
at
roland
face
dispelled
that
idea
why
do
you
want
it
reduced
please
sir
i
going
to
be
what
the
deuce
do
you
mean
when
my
salary
reaches
a
hundred
and
fifty
sir
and
it
a
hundred
and
forty
now
so
if
you
could
see
your
way
to
knocking
off
ten
pounds
fineberg
saw
light
he
was
a
married
man
himself
my
boy
he
said
genially
i
quite
understand
but
i
can
do
you
better
than
that
it
no
use
doing
this
sort
of
thing
in
a
small
way
from
now
on
your
salary
is
a
hundred
and
ten
no
no
do
thank
me
you
an
excellent
clerk
and
it
a
pleasure
to
me
to
reward
merit
when
i
find
it
close
the
door
after
and
fineberg
returned
with
a
lighter
heart
to
the
great
problem
the
circumstances
which
had
led
roland
to
approach
his
employer
may
be
briefly
recounted
since
joining
the
staff
of
fineberg
he
had
lodged
at
the
house
of
a
coppin
in
honorable
employment
as
porter
at
the
local
the
coppin
family
excluding
domestic
pets
consisted
of
coppin
a
kindly
and
garrulous
gentleman
of
sixty
coppin
a
somewhat
negative
personality
most
of
whose
life
was
devoted
to
cooking
and
washing
up
in
her
underground
lair
brothers
frank
and
percy
gentleman
of
leisure
popularly
supposed
to
be
engaged
in
the
mysterious
occupation
known
as
lookin
about
for
somethin
and
lastly
muriel
for
some
months
after
his
arrival
muriel
had
been
to
roland
bleke
a
mere
automaton
a
something
outside
himself
that
was
made
only
for
breakfast
tables
and
silent
removal
of
plates
at
dinner
gradually
however
when
his
natural
shyness
was
soothed
by
use
sufficiently
to
enable
him
to
look
at
her
when
she
came
into
the
room
he
discovered
that
she
was
a
strikingly
pretty
girl
bounded
to
the
north
by
a
mass
of
auburn
hair
and
to
the
south
by
small
and
shapely
feet
she
also
possessed
what
we
are
informed
we
are
children
in
these
matters
ourselves
is
known
as
the
eye
this
eye
had
met
roland
one
evening
as
he
chumped
his
chop
and
before
he
knew
what
he
was
doing
he
had
remarked
that
it
had
been
a
fine
day
from
that
wonderful
moment
matters
had
developed
at
an
incredible
speed
roland
had
a
nice
sense
of
the
social
proprieties
and
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
ignore
a
girl
with
whom
he
had
once
exchanged
easy
conversation
about
the
weather
whenever
she
came
to
lay
his
table
he
felt
bound
to
say
something
not
being
an
experienced
gagger
he
found
it
more
and
more
difficult
each
evening
to
hit
on
something
bright
until
finally
from
sheer
lack
of
inspiration
he
kissed
her
if
matters
had
progressed
rapidly
before
they
went
like
lightning
then
it
was
as
if
he
had
touched
a
spring
or
pressed
a
button
setting
vast
machinery
in
motion
even
as
he
reeled
back
stunned
at
his
audacity
the
room
became
suddenly
full
of
coppins
of
every
variety
known
to
science
through
a
mist
he
was
aware
of
coppin
crying
in
a
corner
of
coppin
drinking
his
health
in
the
remains
of
sparkling
limado
of
brothers
frank
and
percy
one
on
each
side
trying
to
borrow
simultaneously
and
of
muriel
flushed
but
demure
making
and
throwing
them
in
an
abstracted
way
one
by
one
at
the
coppin
cat
which
had
wandered
in
on
the
chance
of
fish
out
of
the
chaos
as
he
stood
looking
at
them
with
his
mouth
open
came
the
word
bans
and
smote
him
like
a
blast
of
east
wind
it
is
not
necessary
to
trace
in
detail
roland
mental
processes
from
that
moment
till
the
day
when
he
applied
to
fineberg
for
a
reduction
of
salary
it
is
enough
to
say
that
for
quite
a
month
he
was
extraordinarily
happy
to
a
man
who
has
had
nothing
to
do
with
women
to
be
engaged
is
an
intoxicating
experience
and
at
first
life
was
one
long
golden
glow
to
roland
secretly
like
all
mild
men
he
had
always
nourished
a
desire
to
be
esteemed
a
nut
by
his
fellow
men
and
his
engagement
satisfied
that
desire
it
was
pleasant
to
hear
brothers
frank
and
percy
cough
knowingly
when
he
came
in
it
was
pleasant
to
walk
abroad
with
a
girl
like
muriel
in
the
capacity
of
the
accepted
wooer
above
all
it
was
pleasant
to
sit
holding
muriel
hand
and
watching
the
efforts
of
albert
potter
to
hide
his
mortification
albert
was
a
mechanic
in
the
round
the
corner
and
hitherto
roland
had
always
felt
something
of
a
worm
in
his
presence
albert
was
so
infernally
strong
and
silent
and
efficient
he
could
dissect
a
car
and
put
it
together
again
he
could
drive
through
the
thickest
traffic
he
could
sit
silent
in
company
without
having
his
silence
attributed
to
shyness
or
imbecility
but
he
could
not
get
engaged
to
muriel
coppin
that
was
reserved
for
roland
bleke
the
nut
the
dasher
the
young
man
of
affairs
it
was
all
very
well
being
able
to
tell
a
from
a
commutator
at
sight
but
when
it
came
to
a
contest
in
an
affair
of
the
heart
with
a
man
like
roland
albert
was
in
his
proper
place
third
at
the
pole
probably
if
he
could
have
gone
on
merely
being
engaged
roland
would
never
have
wearied
of
the
experience
but
the
word
marriage
began
to
creep
more
and
more
into
the
family
conversation
and
suddenly
panic
descended
upon
roland
bleke
all
his
life
he
had
had
a
horror
of
definite
appointments
an
invitation
to
tea
a
week
ahead
had
been
enough
to
poison
life
for
him
he
was
one
of
those
young
men
whose
souls
revolt
at
the
thought
of
planning
out
any
definite
step
he
could
do
things
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
but
plans
made
him
lose
his
nerve
by
the
end
of
the
month
his
whole
being
was
crying
out
to
him
in
agonized
tones
get
me
out
of
this
do
anything
you
like
but
get
me
out
of
this
frightful
marriage
if
anything
had
been
needed
to
emphasize
his
desire
for
freedom
the
attitude
of
frank
and
percy
would
have
supplied
it
every
day
they
made
it
clearer
that
the
man
who
married
muriel
would
be
no
stranger
to
them
it
would
be
his
pleasing
task
to
support
them
too
in
the
style
to
which
they
had
become
accustomed
they
conveyed
the
idea
that
they
went
with
muriel
as
a
sort
of
bonus
the
coppin
family
were
at
high
tea
when
roland
reached
home
there
was
a
general
stir
of
interest
as
he
entered
the
room
for
it
was
known
that
he
had
left
that
morning
with
the
intention
of
approaching
fineberg
on
the
important
matter
of
a
rise
in
salary
coppin
removed
his
saucer
of
tea
from
his
lips
frank
brushed
the
tail
of
a
sardine
from
the
corner
of
his
mouth
percy
ate
his
haddock
in
an
undertone
albert
potter
who
was
present
glowered
silently
roland
shook
his
head
with
the
nearest
approach
to
gloom
which
his
rejoicing
heart
would
permit
i
afraid
i
bad
coppin
burst
into
tears
her
invariable
practise
in
any
crisis
albert
potter
face
relaxed
into
something
resembling
a
smile
he
wo
give
you
your
raise
roland
sighed
he
reduced
reduced
you
yes
times
are
bad
just
at
present
so
he
has
had
to
lower
me
to
a
hundred
and
the
collected
jaws
of
the
family
fell
as
one
jaw
muriel
herself
seemed
to
be
bearing
the
blow
with
fortitude
but
the
rest
were
stunned
frank
and
percy
might
have
been
posing
for
a
picture
of
men
who
had
lost
their
fountain
pens
beneath
the
table
the
hand
of
albert
potter
found
the
hand
of
muriel
coppin
and
held
it
and
muriel
we
regret
to
add
turned
and
bestowed
upon
albert
a
of
tender
understanding
i
suppose
said
roland
we
could
get
married
on
a
hundred
and
ten
no
said
percy
no
said
frank
no
said
albert
potter
they
all
spoke
decidedly
but
albert
the
most
decidedly
of
the
three
then
said
roland
regretfully
i
afraid
we
must
it
seemed
to
be
the
general
verdict
that
they
must
wait
muriel
said
she
thought
they
must
wait
albert
potter
whose
opinion
no
one
had
asked
was
quite
certain
that
they
must
wait
coppin
between
sobs
moaned
that
it
would
be
best
to
wait
frank
and
percy
morosely
devouring
bread
and
jam
said
they
supposed
they
would
have
to
wait
and
to
end
a
painful
scene
roland
drifted
silently
from
the
room
and
went
to
his
own
quarters
there
was
a
telegram
on
the
mantel
some
fellows
he
soliloquized
happily
as
he
opened
it
have
been
able
to
manage
a
little
thing
like
that
they
would
have
given
themselves
away
they
would
the
contents
of
the
telegram
demanded
his
attention
for
some
time
they
conveyed
nothing
to
him
the
thing
might
have
been
written
in
hindustani
it
would
have
been
quite
appropriate
if
it
had
been
for
it
was
from
the
promoters
of
the
calcutta
sweep
and
it
informed
him
that
as
the
holder
of
ticket
number
he
had
drawn
gelatine
and
in
recognition
of
this
fact
a
check
for
five
hundred
pounds
would
be
forwarded
to
him
in
due
course
roland
first
feeling
was
one
of
pure
bewilderment
as
far
as
he
could
recollect
he
had
never
had
any
dealings
whatsoever
with
these
gentlemen
then
memory
opened
her
and
swept
him
back
to
a
morning
ages
ago
so
it
seemed
to
him
when
eldest
son
ralph
passing
through
the
office
on
his
way
to
borrow
money
from
his
father
had
offered
him
for
ten
shillings
down
a
piece
of
cardboard
at
the
same
time
saying
something
about
a
sweep
partly
from
a
vague
desire
to
keep
in
with
the
fineberg
clan
but
principally
because
it
struck
him
as
rather
a
doggish
thing
to
do
roland
had
passed
over
the
ten
shillings
and
there
as
far
as
he
had
known
the
matter
had
ended
and
now
after
all
this
time
that
simple
action
had
borne
fruit
in
the
shape
of
gelatine
and
a
check
for
five
hundred
pounds
roland
next
emotion
was
triumph
the
sudden
entry
of
checks
for
five
hundred
pounds
into
a
man
life
is
apt
to
produce
this
result
for
the
space
of
some
minutes
he
gloated
and
then
reaction
set
in
five
hundred
pounds
meant
marriage
with
muriel
his
brain
worked
quickly
he
must
conceal
this
thing
with
trembling
fingers
he
felt
for
his
struck
a
match
and
burnt
the
telegram
to
ashes
then
feeling
a
little
better
he
sat
down
to
think
the
whole
matter
over
his
meditations
brought
a
certain
amount
of
balm
after
all
he
felt
the
thing
could
quite
easily
be
kept
a
secret
he
would
receive
the
check
in
due
course
as
stated
and
he
would
bicycle
over
to
the
neighboring
town
of
lexingham
and
start
a
with
it
nobody
would
know
and
life
would
go
on
as
before
he
went
to
bed
and
slept
peacefully
it
was
about
a
week
after
this
that
he
was
roused
out
of
a
deep
sleep
at
eight
in
the
morning
to
find
his
room
full
of
coppins
coppin
was
there
in
a
nightshirt
and
his
official
trousers
coppin
was
there
weeping
softly
in
a
brown
modesty
had
apparently
kept
muriel
from
the
gathering
but
brothers
frank
and
percy
stood
at
his
bedside
shaking
him
by
the
shoulders
and
shouting
coppin
thrust
a
newspaper
at
him
as
he
sat
up
blinking
these
epic
moments
are
best
related
swiftly
roland
took
the
paper
and
the
first
thing
that
met
his
sleepy
eye
and
effectually
drove
the
sleep
from
it
was
this
romance
of
the
calcutta
sweepstakes
and
beneath
it
another
in
type
almost
as
large
as
the
first
poor
clerk
wins
his
own
name
leaped
at
him
from
the
printed
page
and
with
it
that
of
the
faithful
gelatine
flight
that
was
the
which
rang
in
roland
brain
as
day
followed
day
the
wild
desire
of
the
trapped
animal
to
be
anywhere
except
just
where
he
was
had
come
upon
him
he
was
past
the
stage
when
conscience
could
have
kept
him
to
his
obligations
he
had
ceased
to
think
of
anything
or
any
one
but
himself
all
he
asked
of
fate
was
to
remove
him
from
bury
edwards
on
any
terms
it
may
be
that
some
inkling
of
his
state
of
mind
was
wafted
telepathically
to
frank
and
percy
for
it
can
not
be
denied
that
their
behavior
at
this
juncture
was
more
than
a
little
reminiscent
of
the
police
force
perhaps
it
was
simply
their
natural
anxiety
to
keep
an
eye
on
what
they
already
considered
their
own
private
that
made
them
so
adhesive
certainly
there
was
no
hour
of
the
day
when
one
or
the
other
was
not
in
roland
immediate
neighborhood
their
vigilance
even
extended
to
the
night
hours
and
once
when
roland
having
tossed
sleeplessly
on
his
bed
got
up
at
two
in
the
morning
with
the
wild
idea
of
stealing
out
of
the
house
and
walking
to
london
a
door
opened
as
he
reached
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
a
voice
asked
him
what
he
thought
he
was
doing
the
statement
that
he
was
walking
in
his
sleep
was
accepted
but
coldly
it
was
shortly
after
this
that
having
by
dint
of
extraordinary
strategy
eluded
the
brothers
and
reached
the
roland
with
his
ticket
to
london
in
his
pocket
and
the
express
already
entering
the
station
was
engaged
in
conversation
by
old
coppin
who
appeared
from
nowhere
to
denounce
the
high
cost
of
living
in
a
speech
that
lasted
until
the
of
the
train
had
vanished
and
brothers
frank
and
percy
arrived
panting
a
man
has
only
a
certain
capacity
for
battling
with
fate
after
this
last
episode
roland
gave
in
not
even
the
exquisite
agony
of
hearing
himself
described
in
church
as
a
bachelor
of
this
parish
with
the
grim
addition
that
this
was
for
the
second
time
of
asking
could
stir
him
to
a
fresh
dash
for
liberty
altho
the
shadow
of
the
future
occupied
roland
mind
almost
to
the
exclusion
of
everything
else
he
was
still
capable
of
suffering
a
certain
amount
of
additional
torment
from
the
present
and
one
of
the
things
which
made
the
present
a
source
of
misery
to
him
was
the
fact
that
he
was
expected
to
behave
more
like
a
mad
millionaire
than
a
sober
young
man
with
a
knowledge
of
the
value
of
money
his
mind
trained
from
infancy
to
a
decent
respect
for
the
pence
had
not
yet
adjusted
itself
to
the
possession
of
large
means
and
the
role
forced
upon
him
by
the
family
appalled
him
when
the
coppins
wanted
anything
they
asked
for
it
and
it
seemed
to
roland
that
they
wanted
pretty
nearly
everything
if
coppin
had
reached
his
present
age
without
the
assistance
of
a
gold
watch
he
might
surely
have
struggled
along
to
the
end
on
in
any
case
a
man
of
his
years
should
have
been
thinking
of
higher
things
than
mere
gauds
and
trinkets
a
like
criticism
applied
to
coppin
demand
for
a
silk
petticoat
which
struck
roland
as
simply
indecent
frank
and
percy
took
theirs
mostly
in
specie
it
was
muriel
who
struck
the
worst
blow
by
insisting
on
a
hired
roland
hated
especially
when
they
were
driven
by
albert
potter
as
this
one
was
albert
that
strong
silent
man
had
but
one
way
of
expressing
his
emotions
namely
to
open
the
throttle
and
shave
the
paint
off
disappointed
love
was
giving
albert
a
good
deal
of
discomfort
at
this
time
and
he
found
it
made
him
feel
better
to
go
round
corners
on
two
wheels
as
muriel
sat
next
to
him
on
these
expeditions
roland
squashing
into
the
tonneau
with
frank
and
percy
his
torments
were
subtle
he
was
not
given
a
chance
to
forget
and
the
only
way
in
which
he
could
obtain
a
momentary
diminution
of
the
agony
was
to
increase
the
speed
to
sixty
miles
an
hour
it
was
in
this
fashion
that
they
journeyed
to
the
neighboring
town
of
lexingham
to
see
etienne
feriaud
perform
his
feat
of
looping
the
loop
in
his
aeroplane
it
was
brother
frank
idea
that
they
should
make
up
a
party
to
go
and
see
feriaud
frank
was
one
of
those
generous
unspoiled
natures
which
never
grow
at
the
sight
of
a
fellow
human
taking
a
sporting
chance
at
he
was
a
figure
at
every
wild
animal
exhibition
within
a
radius
of
fifty
miles
and
feriaud
drew
him
like
a
magnet
the
blighter
goes
up
he
explained
as
he
conducted
the
party
into
the
arena
and
then
he
stands
on
his
head
and
goes
round
in
circles
seen
pictures
of
it
appeared
that
feriaud
did
even
more
than
this
posters
round
the
ground
advertised
the
fact
that
on
receipt
of
five
pounds
he
would
take
up
a
passenger
with
him
to
date
however
there
appeared
to
have
been
no
rush
on
the
part
of
the
canny
inhabitants
of
lexingham
to
avail
themselves
of
this
chance
of
a
breath
of
fresh
air
feriaud
a
small
man
with
a
chubby
and
amiable
face
wandered
about
signing
picture
cards
and
smoking
a
lighted
cigaret
looking
a
little
disappointed
albert
potter
was
scornful
lot
of
rabbits
he
said
where
their
pluck
and
i
suppose
they
call
themselves
englishmen
i
go
up
precious
quick
if
i
had
a
note
disgrace
i
call
it
letting
a
frenchman
have
the
laugh
of
it
was
a
long
speech
for
potter
and
it
drew
a
look
of
respectful
tenderness
from
muriel
you
so
brave
potter
she
said
whether
it
was
the
slight
emphasis
which
she
put
on
the
first
word
or
whether
it
was
sheer
generosity
that
impelled
him
one
can
not
say
but
roland
produced
the
required
sum
even
while
she
spoke
he
offered
it
to
his
rival
potter
started
turned
a
little
pale
then
drew
himself
up
and
waved
the
note
aside
i
take
no
favors
he
said
with
dignity
there
was
a
pause
why
do
you
do
said
albert
nastily
five
pounds
is
nothing
to
why
should
i
ah
why
should
you
it
would
be
useless
to
assert
that
potter
tone
was
friendly
it
stung
roland
it
seemed
to
him
that
muriel
was
looking
at
him
in
an
unpleasantly
contemptuous
manner
in
some
curious
fashion
without
doing
anything
to
merit
it
he
had
apparently
become
an
object
of
scorn
and
derision
to
the
party
all
right
then
i
will
he
said
suddenly
easy
enough
to
talk
said
albert
roland
strode
with
a
pale
but
determined
face
to
the
spot
where
feriaud
beaming
politely
was
signing
a
picture
some
feeling
of
compunction
appeared
to
come
to
muriel
at
the
eleventh
hour
do
let
him
she
cried
but
brother
frank
was
made
of
sterner
stuff
this
was
precisely
the
sort
of
thing
which
in
his
opinion
made
for
a
jolly
afternoon
for
years
he
had
been
waiting
for
something
of
this
kind
he
was
experiencing
that
pleasant
thrill
which
comes
to
a
certain
type
of
person
when
the
victim
of
a
murder
in
the
morning
paper
is
an
acquaintance
of
theirs
what
are
you
talking
about
he
said
there
no
danger
at
least
not
much
he
might
easily
come
down
all
right
besides
he
wants
to
what
do
you
want
to
go
interfering
for
roland
returned
the
negotiations
with
the
had
lasted
a
little
longer
than
one
would
have
expected
but
then
of
course
feriaud
was
a
foreigner
and
roland
french
was
not
fluent
he
took
muriel
hand
he
said
he
shook
hands
with
the
rest
of
the
party
even
with
albert
potter
it
struck
frank
that
he
was
making
too
much
fuss
over
a
trifle
and
worse
delaying
the
start
of
the
proceedings
what
it
all
about
he
demanded
you
go
on
as
if
we
were
never
going
to
see
you
you
never
it
as
safe
as
being
in
but
still
in
case
we
never
meet
again
oh
well
said
brother
frank
and
took
the
outstretched
hand
the
little
party
stood
and
watched
as
the
aeroplane
moved
swiftly
along
the
ground
rose
and
soared
into
the
air
higher
and
higher
it
rose
till
the
features
of
the
two
occupants
were
almost
invisible
now
said
brother
frank
now
watch
now
he
going
to
loop
the
but
the
wheels
of
the
aeroplane
still
pointed
to
the
ground
it
grew
smaller
and
smaller
it
was
a
mere
speck
what
the
dickens
far
away
to
the
west
something
showed
up
against
the
blue
of
the
sky
something
that
might
have
been
a
bird
a
toy
kite
or
an
aeroplane
traveling
rapidly
into
the
sunset
four
pairs
of
eyes
followed
it
in
rapt
silence
the
episode
of
the
financial
napoleon
second
of
a
series
of
six
stories
first
published
in
june
seated
with
his
wife
at
breakfast
on
the
veranda
which
overlooked
the
rolling
lawns
and
leafy
woods
of
his
charming
sussex
home
geoffrey
windlebird
the
great
financier
was
enjoying
the
morning
sun
to
the
full
his
chubby
features
were
relaxed
in
a
smile
of
lazy
contentment
and
his
wife
who
liked
to
act
sometimes
as
his
secretary
found
it
difficult
to
get
him
to
pay
any
attention
to
his
morning
mail
there
a
column
in
she
said
of
which
you
really
must
take
notice
it
most
abusive
it
about
the
wildcat
reef
they
assert
that
there
never
was
any
gold
in
the
mine
and
that
you
knew
it
when
you
floated
the
they
will
have
their
little
but
you
had
the
usual
of
course
we
had
and
a
capital
report
it
was
i
remember
thinking
at
the
time
what
a
neat
turn
of
phrase
the
fellow
had
i
admit
he
depended
rather
on
his
fine
optimism
than
on
any
examination
of
the
mine
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
never
went
near
it
and
why
should
he
it
down
in
south
america
somewhere
awful
climate
snakes
mosquitoes
revolutions
windlebird
spoke
drowsily
his
eyes
closed
well
the
argus
people
say
that
they
have
sent
a
man
of
their
own
out
there
to
make
inquiries
a
expert
and
the
report
will
be
in
within
the
next
fortnight
they
say
they
will
publish
it
in
their
next
number
but
one
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
windlebird
yawned
not
to
put
too
fine
a
point
on
it
dearest
the
game
is
up
the
napoleon
of
finance
is
about
to
meet
his
waterloo
and
all
for
twenty
thousand
pounds
that
is
the
really
bitter
part
of
it
we
sail
for
the
argentine
i
got
the
you
joking
geoffrey
you
must
be
able
to
raise
twenty
thousand
it
a
on
paper
in
the
form
of
shares
script
bonds
promissory
notes
it
is
a
but
when
it
has
to
be
produced
in
the
raw
in
flat
hard
lumps
of
gold
or
in
crackling
it
more
like
a
bite
from
a
hippopotamus
i
ca
raise
it
and
that
all
about
it
so
helena
for
altho
geoffrey
windlebird
described
himself
as
a
napoleon
of
finance
a
cinquevalli
or
chung
ling
soo
of
finance
would
have
been
a
more
accurate
title
as
a
juggler
with
other
people
money
he
was
at
the
head
of
his
class
and
yet
when
one
came
to
examine
it
his
method
was
delightfully
simple
say
for
instance
that
the
tobacco
trust
founded
by
geoffrey
in
a
moment
of
ennui
failed
to
yield
those
profits
which
the
glowing
prospectus
had
led
the
public
to
expect
geoffrey
would
appease
the
excited
shareholders
by
giving
them
preference
shares
interest
guaranteed
in
the
extraction
company
hastily
floated
to
meet
the
emergency
when
the
interest
became
due
it
would
as
likely
as
not
be
paid
out
of
the
capital
just
subscribed
for
the
king
solomon
mines
exploitation
association
the
little
deficiency
in
the
latter
being
replaced
in
its
turn
when
absolutely
necessary
and
not
a
moment
before
by
the
transfer
of
some
portion
of
the
capital
just
raised
for
yet
another
company
and
so
on
ad
infinitum
there
were
moments
when
it
seemed
to
windlebird
that
he
had
solved
the
problem
of
perpetual
promotion
the
only
thing
that
can
stop
a
triumphal
progress
like
is
when
some
coarse
person
refuses
to
play
to
the
rules
and
demands
ready
money
instead
of
shares
in
the
next
venture
this
had
happened
now
and
it
had
flattened
windlebird
like
an
avalanche
he
was
a
philosopher
but
he
could
not
help
feeling
a
little
galled
that
the
demand
which
had
destroyed
him
had
been
so
trivial
he
had
handled
millions
on
paper
it
was
true
but
still
millions
and
here
he
was
knocked
out
of
time
by
a
paltry
twenty
thousand
pounds
are
you
absolutely
sure
that
nothing
can
be
done
persisted
windlebird
have
you
tried
every
one
every
one
dear
the
probables
the
possibles
the
highly
unlikelies
and
the
impossibles
never
an
echo
to
the
wooing
song
no
my
dear
we
have
got
to
take
to
the
boats
this
time
unless
of
course
some
one
possessed
at
one
and
the
same
time
of
twenty
thousand
pounds
and
a
very
confiding
nature
happens
to
drop
from
the
as
he
spoke
an
aeroplane
came
sailing
over
the
tops
of
the
trees
beyond
the
gracefully
as
a
bird
it
settled
on
the
smooth
turf
not
twenty
yards
from
where
he
was
seated
roland
bleke
stepped
stiffly
out
onto
the
his
progress
rather
resembled
that
of
a
landsman
getting
out
of
an
open
boat
in
which
he
has
spent
a
long
and
perilous
night
at
sea
he
was
feeling
more
wretched
than
he
had
ever
felt
in
his
life
he
had
a
severe
cold
he
had
a
splitting
headache
his
hands
and
feet
were
frozen
his
eyes
smarted
he
was
hungry
he
was
thirsty
he
hated
cheerful
feriaud
who
had
hopped
out
and
was
now
busy
tinkering
the
engine
a
gay
provencal
air
upon
his
lips
as
he
had
rarely
hated
any
one
even
muriel
brother
frank
so
absorbed
was
he
in
his
troubles
that
he
was
not
aware
of
windlebird
approach
until
that
pleasant
portly
man
shadow
fell
on
the
turf
before
him
not
had
an
accident
i
hope
bleke
roland
was
too
far
gone
in
misery
to
speculate
as
to
how
this
genial
stranger
came
to
know
his
name
as
a
matter
of
fact
windlebird
keen
student
of
the
illustrated
press
had
recognized
roland
by
his
photograph
in
the
daily
mirror
in
the
course
of
the
twenty
yards
walk
from
house
to
she
had
put
her
husband
into
possession
of
the
more
salient
points
in
roland
history
it
was
when
windlebird
heard
that
roland
had
forty
thousand
pounds
in
the
bank
that
he
sat
up
and
took
notice
lead
me
to
him
he
said
simply
roland
sneezed
doe
accident
thag
you
he
replied
miserably
somethig
gone
wrong
with
the
worgs
but
it
nothing
serious
worse
feriaud
having
by
this
time
adjusted
the
defect
in
his
engine
rose
to
his
feet
and
bowed
excuse
if
we
come
down
on
your
lawn
but
not
long
do
we
trespass
see
he
said
radiantly
to
roland
all
now
we
go
no
said
roland
decidedly
no
what
you
mean
no
a
shade
of
alarm
fell
on
feriaud
features
the
eminent
did
not
wish
to
part
from
roland
toward
roland
he
felt
like
a
brother
for
roland
had
notions
about
payment
for
little
aeroplane
rides
which
bordered
upon
the
princely
but
you
say
take
me
to
france
with
you
i
know
but
it
all
off
i
not
feeling
but
it
all
feriaud
gesticulated
to
drive
home
his
point
you
give
me
one
hundred
pounds
to
take
you
away
from
lexingham
good
it
is
he
slapped
his
breast
pocket
but
the
other
two
hundred
pounds
which
also
you
promise
me
to
pay
me
when
i
place
you
safe
in
france
where
is
that
my
friend
i
will
give
you
two
hundred
and
fifty
said
roland
earnestly
to
leave
me
here
and
go
right
away
and
never
let
me
see
your
beastly
machine
a
smile
of
brotherly
forgiveness
lit
up
feriaud
face
the
generous
gallic
nature
asserted
itself
he
held
out
his
arms
affectionately
to
roland
ah
now
you
talk
now
you
say
something
he
cried
in
his
impetuous
way
embrace
me
you
are
all
roland
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
when
five
minutes
later
the
aeroplane
disappeared
over
the
brow
of
the
hill
then
he
began
to
sneeze
again
you
not
well
you
know
said
windlebird
i
caught
cold
we
been
flying
about
all
night
that
french
ass
lost
his
bearings
and
my
suit
is
thin
can
you
direct
me
to
a
hotel
hotel
windlebird
spoke
in
the
bluff
breezy
voice
which
at
many
a
stricken
had
calmed
frantic
shareholders
as
if
by
magic
you
coming
right
into
my
house
and
up
to
bed
this
it
was
not
till
he
was
between
the
sheets
with
a
bottle
at
his
toes
and
a
huge
breakfast
inside
him
that
roland
learned
the
name
of
his
good
samaritan
when
he
did
his
first
impulse
was
to
struggle
out
of
bed
and
make
his
escape
geoffrey
windlebird
was
a
name
which
he
had
learned
in
the
course
of
his
mercantile
career
to
hold
in
something
approaching
reverence
as
that
of
one
of
the
mightiest
business
brains
of
the
age
to
have
to
meet
so
eminent
a
man
in
the
capacity
of
invalid
a
nuisance
about
the
house
was
almost
too
much
for
roland
shrinking
nature
the
kindness
of
the
windlebirds
and
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
that
they
were
not
ready
to
do
for
him
distressed
him
beyond
measure
to
have
a
really
great
man
like
geoffrey
windlebird
sprawling
genially
over
his
bed
chatting
away
as
if
he
were
an
ordinary
friend
was
almost
horrible
such
condescension
was
too
much
gradually
as
he
became
convalescent
roland
found
this
feeling
replaced
by
something
more
comfortable
they
were
such
a
genuine
simple
kindly
couple
these
windlebirds
that
he
lost
awe
and
retained
only
gratitude
he
loved
them
both
he
opened
his
heart
to
them
it
was
not
long
before
he
had
told
them
the
history
of
his
career
skipping
the
earlier
years
and
beginning
with
the
entry
of
wealth
into
his
life
it
makes
you
feel
funny
he
confided
to
windlebird
sympathetic
ear
suddenly
coming
into
a
pot
of
money
like
that
you
do
seem
hardly
able
to
realize
it
i
do
know
what
to
do
with
windlebird
smiled
paternally
the
advice
of
an
older
man
who
has
had
if
i
may
say
so
some
little
experience
of
finance
might
be
useful
to
you
there
perhaps
if
you
would
allow
me
to
recommend
some
sound
investment
roland
glowed
with
gratitude
there
just
one
thing
i
like
to
do
before
i
start
putting
my
money
into
anything
it
like
he
briefly
related
the
story
of
his
unfortunate
affair
with
muriel
coppin
within
an
hour
of
his
departure
in
the
aeroplane
his
conscience
had
begun
to
trouble
him
on
this
point
he
felt
that
he
had
not
acted
well
toward
muriel
true
he
was
practically
certain
that
she
care
a
bit
about
him
and
was
in
love
with
albert
the
silent
mechanic
but
there
was
just
the
chance
that
she
was
mourning
over
his
loss
and
anyhow
his
conscience
was
sore
i
like
to
give
her
something
he
said
how
much
do
you
think
windlebird
perpended
i
tell
you
what
i
do
i
send
my
own
lawyer
to
her
with
say
a
thousand
pounds
not
a
check
you
understand
but
one
thousand
golden
sovereigns
that
he
can
show
her
roll
about
on
the
table
in
front
of
her
eyes
that
console
her
it
wonderful
the
effect
money
in
the
raw
has
on
i
rather
make
it
two
thousand
said
roland
he
had
never
really
loved
muriel
and
the
idea
of
marrying
her
had
been
a
nightmare
to
him
but
he
wanted
to
retreat
with
honor
very
well
make
it
two
thousand
if
you
like
tho
i
do
quite
know
how
old
harrison
is
going
to
carry
all
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
old
harrison
never
had
to
try
on
thinking
it
over
after
he
had
cashed
roland
check
windlebird
came
to
the
conclusion
that
seven
hundred
pounds
would
be
quite
as
much
money
as
it
would
be
good
for
miss
coppin
to
have
all
at
once
windlebird
knowledge
of
human
nature
was
not
at
fault
muriel
jumped
at
the
money
and
a
letter
in
her
handwriting
informed
roland
next
morning
that
his
slate
was
clean
his
gratitude
to
windlebird
redoubled
and
now
said
windlebird
genially
we
can
talk
about
that
money
of
yours
and
the
best
way
of
investing
it
what
you
want
is
something
which
without
being
in
any
way
what
is
called
speculative
nevertheless
returns
a
fair
and
reasonable
amount
of
interest
what
you
want
is
something
sound
something
solid
yet
something
with
a
bit
of
a
kick
to
it
something
which
ca
go
down
and
may
go
soaring
like
a
roland
quietly
announced
that
was
just
what
he
did
want
and
lit
another
cigar
now
look
here
bleke
my
boy
as
a
general
rule
i
do
give
tips
but
i
taken
a
great
fancy
to
you
bleke
and
i
going
to
break
my
rule
put
your
money
he
sank
his
voice
to
a
compelling
whisper
put
every
penny
you
can
afford
into
wildcat
he
leaned
back
with
the
benign
air
of
the
alchemist
who
has
just
imparted
to
a
favorite
disciple
the
recently
discovered
secret
of
the
philosopher
stone
thank
you
very
much
windlebird
said
roland
gratefully
i
the
napoleonic
features
were
lightened
by
that
rare
indulgent
smile
not
so
fast
young
man
laughed
windlebird
getting
into
wildcat
reefs
is
quite
so
easy
as
you
seem
to
think
shall
we
say
that
you
propose
to
invest
thirty
thousand
pounds
yes
very
well
then
thirty
thousand
pounds
why
if
it
got
about
that
you
were
going
to
buy
wildcat
reefs
on
that
scale
the
market
would
be
which
was
perfectly
true
if
it
had
got
about
that
any
one
was
going
to
invest
thirty
thousand
pounds
or
pence
in
wildcat
reefs
the
market
would
certainly
have
been
convulsed
the
house
would
have
rocked
with
laughter
wildcat
reefs
were
a
standing
joke
except
to
the
unfortunate
few
who
still
held
any
of
the
shares
the
thing
will
have
to
be
done
very
cautiously
no
one
must
know
but
i
think
i
say
i
think
i
can
manage
it
for
you
awfully
kind
not
at
all
my
dear
boy
not
at
all
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
shall
be
doing
a
very
good
turn
to
another
pal
of
mine
at
the
same
he
filled
his
glass
this
he
paused
to
sip
this
pal
of
mine
has
a
large
holding
of
wildcats
he
wants
to
realize
in
order
to
put
the
money
into
something
else
in
which
he
is
more
personally
windlebird
paused
his
mind
dwelt
for
a
moment
on
his
overdrawn
current
account
at
the
bank
in
which
he
is
more
personally
interested
he
repeated
dreamily
but
of
course
you
could
unload
thirty
worth
of
wildcats
in
the
public
i
quite
see
that
assented
roland
it
might
however
be
done
by
private
negotiation
he
said
i
must
act
very
cautiously
give
me
your
check
for
the
thirty
thousand
and
i
will
run
up
to
town
morning
and
see
what
i
can
he
did
it
what
hidden
strings
he
pulled
what
levers
he
used
roland
did
not
know
all
roland
knew
was
that
somehow
by
some
subtle
means
windlebird
brought
it
off
two
days
later
his
host
handed
him
twenty
thousand
shares
in
the
wildcat
reef
there
my
boy
he
said
it
awfully
kind
of
you
my
dear
boy
do
mention
it
if
you
satisfied
i
sure
i
windlebird
always
spoke
the
truth
when
he
could
he
spoke
it
now
it
seemed
to
roland
as
the
days
went
by
that
nothing
could
mar
the
pleasant
easy
course
of
life
at
the
windlebirds
the
fine
weather
the
beautiful
garden
the
pleasant
company
all
these
things
combined
to
make
this
sojourn
an
epoch
in
his
life
he
discovered
his
mistake
one
lovely
afternoon
as
he
sat
smoking
idly
on
the
terrace
windlebird
came
to
him
and
a
glance
was
enough
to
show
roland
that
something
was
seriously
wrong
her
face
was
drawn
and
tired
a
moment
before
roland
had
been
thinking
life
perfect
the
only
crumpled
had
been
the
absence
of
an
evening
paper
windlebird
would
bring
one
back
with
him
when
he
returned
from
the
city
but
roland
wanted
one
now
he
was
a
great
follower
of
county
cricket
and
he
wanted
to
know
how
surrey
was
faring
against
yorkshire
but
even
this
crumpled
had
been
smoothed
out
for
johnson
the
groom
who
happened
to
be
riding
into
the
nearest
town
on
an
errand
had
promised
to
bring
one
back
with
him
he
might
appear
at
any
moment
now
the
sight
of
his
hostess
drove
all
thoughts
of
sport
out
of
his
mind
she
was
looking
terribly
troubled
it
flashed
across
roland
that
both
his
host
and
hostess
had
been
unusually
silent
at
dinner
the
night
before
and
later
passing
windlebird
room
on
his
way
to
bed
he
had
heard
their
voices
low
and
agitated
could
they
have
had
some
bad
news
mr
bleke
i
want
to
speak
to
roland
moved
like
a
sympathetic
cow
and
waited
to
hear
more
you
were
not
up
when
my
husband
left
for
the
city
this
morning
or
he
would
have
told
you
himself
bleke
i
hardly
know
how
to
break
it
to
break
it
to
me
my
husband
advised
you
to
put
a
very
large
sum
of
money
in
a
mine
called
wildcat
yes
thirty
thousand
as
much
as
that
oh
bleke
she
began
to
cry
softly
she
pressed
his
hand
roland
gaped
at
her
mr
bleke
there
has
been
a
terrible
slump
in
wildcat
reefs
they
may
be
absolutely
roland
felt
as
if
a
cold
hand
had
been
laid
on
his
spine
he
stammered
windlebird
looked
at
him
with
moist
eyes
you
can
imagine
how
my
husband
feels
about
this
it
was
on
his
advice
that
you
invested
your
money
he
holds
himself
directly
responsible
he
is
in
a
terrible
state
of
mind
he
is
frantic
he
has
grown
so
fond
of
you
bleke
that
he
can
hardly
face
the
thought
that
he
has
been
the
innocent
instrument
of
your
roland
felt
that
it
was
an
admirable
comparison
his
sensations
were
precisely
those
of
a
leading
actor
in
an
earthquake
the
solid
earth
seemed
to
melt
under
him
we
talked
it
over
last
night
after
you
had
gone
to
bed
and
we
came
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
only
one
honorable
step
to
take
we
must
make
good
your
losses
we
must
buy
back
those
a
ray
of
hope
began
to
steal
over
roland
horizon
but
he
began
there
are
no
buts
really
bleke
we
should
neither
of
us
know
a
minute
peace
if
we
did
do
it
now
you
paid
thirty
thousand
pounds
for
the
shares
you
said
well
she
held
out
a
pink
slip
of
paper
to
him
this
will
make
everything
all
roland
looked
at
the
check
but
but
this
is
signed
by
you
he
said
yes
you
see
if
geoffrey
had
to
sign
a
check
for
that
amount
it
would
mean
selling
out
some
of
his
stock
and
in
his
position
with
every
movement
watched
by
enemies
he
can
not
afford
to
do
it
it
might
ruin
the
plans
of
years
but
i
have
some
money
of
my
own
my
selling
out
stock
does
matter
you
see
i
have
the
check
a
week
to
give
me
time
to
realize
on
the
securities
in
which
my
money
is
roland
whole
nature
rose
in
revolt
at
this
sacrifice
if
it
had
been
his
host
who
had
made
this
offer
he
would
have
accepted
it
but
chivalry
forbade
his
taking
this
money
from
a
woman
a
glow
of
warmed
him
after
all
what
was
this
money
of
his
he
had
never
had
any
fun
out
of
it
he
had
had
so
little
acquaintance
with
it
that
for
all
practical
purposes
it
might
never
have
been
his
with
a
gesture
which
had
once
impressed
him
very
favorably
when
exhibited
on
the
stage
by
the
hero
of
the
number
two
company
of
the
price
of
honor
which
had
paid
a
six
days
visit
to
bury
edwards
a
few
months
before
he
tore
the
check
into
little
pieces
i
could
accept
it
windlebird
he
said
i
ca
tell
you
how
deeply
i
appreciate
your
wonderful
kindness
but
i
really
could
i
bought
the
shares
with
my
eyes
open
the
whole
thing
is
nobody
fault
and
i
ca
let
you
suffer
for
it
after
the
way
you
have
treated
me
here
it
would
be
impossible
i
ca
take
your
money
it
noble
and
generous
of
you
in
the
extreme
but
i
ca
accept
it
i
still
got
a
little
money
left
and
i
always
been
used
to
working
for
my
living
anyway
so
so
it
all
mr
bleke
i
implore
roland
was
hideously
embarrassed
he
looked
right
and
left
for
a
way
of
escape
he
could
hardly
take
to
his
heels
and
yet
there
seemed
no
other
way
of
ending
the
interview
then
with
a
start
of
relief
he
perceived
johnson
the
groom
coming
toward
him
with
the
evening
paper
johnson
said
he
was
going
into
the
town
said
roland
apologetically
so
i
asked
him
to
get
me
an
evening
paper
i
wanted
to
see
the
lunch
if
he
had
been
looking
at
his
hostess
then
an
action
which
he
was
strenuously
avoiding
he
might
have
seen
a
curious
spasm
pass
over
her
face
windlebird
turned
very
pale
and
sat
down
suddenly
in
the
chair
which
roland
had
vacated
at
the
beginning
of
their
conversation
she
lay
back
in
it
with
her
eyes
closed
she
looked
tired
and
defeated
roland
took
the
paper
mechanically
he
wanted
it
as
a
diversion
to
the
conversation
merely
for
his
interest
in
the
doings
of
surrey
and
yorkshire
had
waned
to
the
point
of
complete
indifference
in
competition
with
windlebird
news
equally
mechanically
he
unfolded
it
and
glanced
at
front
page
and
as
he
did
do
a
flaring
explosion
of
headlines
smote
his
eye
out
of
the
explosion
emerged
the
word
why
he
exclaimed
there
columns
about
on
the
front
page
here
yes
windlebird
voice
sounded
strangely
dull
and
toneless
her
eyes
were
still
closed
roland
took
in
the
headlines
with
starting
eyes
the
reef
another
klondike
frenzied
scenes
on
the
stock
exchange
brokers
fight
for
shares
record
boom
unprecedented
rise
in
prices
shorn
of
all
superfluous
adjectives
and
general
journalistic
exuberance
what
the
paper
had
to
announce
to
its
readers
was
this
the
special
commissioner
sent
out
by
the
to
make
an
exhaustive
examination
of
the
reef
mine
with
the
amiable
view
no
doubt
of
exploding
geoffrey
windlebird
once
and
for
all
with
the
confiding
british
public
has
found
to
his
unbounded
astonishment
that
there
are
vast
quantities
of
gold
in
the
mine
the
discovery
of
the
new
reef
the
largest
and
richest
it
is
stated
since
the
famous
mount
morgan
occurred
with
dramatic
appropriateness
on
the
very
day
of
his
arrival
we
need
scarcely
remind
our
readers
that
until
that
moment
reef
shares
had
reached
a
very
low
figure
and
only
a
few
optimists
retained
their
faith
in
the
mine
as
the
largest
holder
windlebird
is
to
be
heartily
congratulated
on
this
new
addition
to
his
fortune
the
publication
of
the
expert
report
in
the
has
resulted
in
a
boom
in
the
like
of
which
can
seldom
have
been
seen
on
the
stock
exchange
from
something
like
one
shilling
and
sixpence
per
bundle
the
one
pound
shares
have
gone
up
to
nearly
ten
pounds
a
share
and
even
at
this
latter
figure
people
were
literally
fighting
to
secure
them
the
world
swam
about
roland
he
was
stupefied
and
even
terrified
the
very
atmosphere
seemed
foggy
so
far
as
his
reeling
brain
was
capable
of
thought
he
figured
that
he
was
now
worth
about
two
hundred
thousand
pounds
oh
windlebird
he
cried
it
all
right
after
windlebird
sat
back
in
her
chair
without
answering
it
all
right
for
every
one
screamed
roland
joyfully
why
if
made
a
couple
of
hundred
thousand
what
must
windlebird
have
netted
it
says
here
that
he
is
the
largest
holder
he
must
have
pulled
off
the
biggest
thing
of
his
he
thought
for
a
moment
the
chap
i
sorry
for
he
said
meditatively
is
pal
you
know
the
fellow
whom
windlebird
persuaded
to
sell
all
his
shares
to
a
faint
moan
escaped
from
his
hostess
pale
lips
roland
did
not
hear
it
he
was
reading
the
cricket
news
the
episode
of
the
theatrical
venture
third
of
a
series
of
six
stories
first
published
in
july
it
was
one
of
those
hard
nubbly
rolls
the
best
restaurants
charge
you
sixpence
for
having
the
good
sense
not
to
eat
them
it
hit
roland
bleke
with
considerable
vehemence
on
the
bridge
of
the
nose
for
the
moment
roland
fancied
that
the
roof
of
the
regent
must
have
fallen
in
and
as
this
would
automatically
put
an
end
to
the
party
he
was
not
altogether
sorry
he
had
never
been
to
a
theatrical
before
and
within
five
minutes
of
his
arrival
at
the
present
one
he
had
become
afflicted
with
an
intense
desire
never
to
go
to
a
theatrical
again
to
be
a
success
at
these
gay
gatherings
one
must
possess
dash
and
roland
whatever
his
other
sterling
qualities
was
a
little
short
of
dash
the
young
man
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
was
quite
nice
about
it
while
not
actually
apologizing
he
went
so
far
as
to
explain
that
it
was
old
gerry
whom
he
had
had
in
his
mind
when
he
started
the
roll
on
its
course
after
a
glance
at
old
gerry
a
chinless
child
of
about
nineteen
roland
felt
that
it
would
be
churlish
to
be
angry
with
a
young
man
whose
intentions
had
been
so
wholly
admirable
old
gerry
had
one
of
those
faces
in
which
any
alteration
even
the
comparatively
limited
one
which
a
roll
would
be
capable
of
producing
was
bound
to
be
for
the
better
he
smiled
a
sickly
smile
and
said
that
it
did
matter
the
charming
creature
who
sat
on
his
assailant
left
however
took
a
more
serious
view
of
the
situation
sidney
you
make
me
tired
she
said
severely
if
i
had
thought
you
did
know
how
to
act
like
a
gentleman
i
would
have
come
here
with
you
go
away
somewhere
and
throw
bread
at
yourself
and
ask
bleke
to
come
and
sit
by
me
i
want
to
talk
to
that
was
roland
first
introduction
to
miss
billy
verepoint
i
been
wanting
to
have
a
chat
with
you
all
the
evening
bleke
she
said
as
roland
blushingly
sank
into
the
empty
chair
i
heard
such
a
lot
about
what
miss
verepoint
had
heard
about
roland
was
that
he
had
two
hundred
thousand
pounds
and
apparently
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
it
in
fact
if
i
had
been
told
that
you
would
be
here
i
should
have
come
to
this
party
ca
stand
these
gatherings
of
nuts
in
may
as
a
general
rule
they
bore
me
roland
hastily
revised
his
first
estimate
of
the
theatrical
profession
shallow
creatures
some
of
them
might
be
no
doubt
but
there
were
exceptions
here
was
a
girl
of
real
discernment
a
thoughtful
student
of
character
a
girl
who
understood
that
a
man
might
sit
at
a
without
uttering
a
word
and
might
still
be
a
man
of
parts
i
afraid
you
think
me
very
outspoken
but
that
me
all
over
all
my
friends
say
verepoint
a
funny
girl
if
she
likes
any
one
she
just
tells
them
so
straight
out
and
if
she
does
like
any
one
she
tells
them
straight
out
too
and
a
very
admirable
trait
said
roland
enthusiastically
miss
verepoint
sighed
it
is
she
said
pensively
but
afraid
it
what
has
kept
me
back
in
my
profession
managers
do
like
it
they
think
girls
should
be
seen
and
not
roland
blood
boiled
managers
were
plainly
a
dastardly
crew
but
what
the
good
of
worrying
went
on
miss
verepoint
with
a
brave
but
hollow
laugh
of
course
it
wearing
having
to
wait
when
one
has
got
as
much
ambition
as
i
have
but
they
all
tell
me
that
my
chance
is
bound
to
come
some
the
intense
mournfulness
of
miss
verepoint
expression
seemed
to
indicate
that
she
anticipated
the
arrival
of
the
desired
day
not
less
than
sixty
years
hence
roland
was
profoundly
moved
his
chivalrous
nature
was
up
in
arms
he
fell
to
wondering
if
he
could
do
anything
to
help
this
victim
of
managerial
unfairness
you
do
mind
my
going
on
about
my
troubles
do
you
asked
miss
verepoint
solicitously
one
so
seldom
meets
anybody
really
roland
babbled
fervent
assurances
and
she
pressed
his
hand
gratefully
i
wonder
if
you
would
care
to
come
to
tea
one
afternoon
she
said
oh
rather
said
roland
he
would
have
liked
to
put
it
in
a
more
polished
way
but
he
was
almost
beyond
speech
of
course
i
know
what
a
busy
man
you
are
no
no
well
i
should
be
in
afternoon
if
you
cared
to
look
roland
bleated
gratefully
i
write
down
the
address
for
you
said
miss
verepoint
suddenly
businesslike
exactly
when
he
committed
himself
to
the
purchase
of
the
windsor
theater
roland
could
never
say
the
idea
seemed
to
come
into
existence
without
preliminary
discussion
one
moment
it
was
not
the
next
it
was
his
recollections
of
the
afternoon
which
he
spent
drinking
lukewarm
tea
and
punctuating
miss
verepoint
flow
of
speech
with
yes
and
no
were
always
so
thoroughly
confused
that
he
never
knew
even
whose
suggestion
it
was
the
purchase
of
a
theater
when
one
has
the
necessary
cash
is
not
nearly
such
a
complicated
business
as
the
layman
might
imagine
roland
was
staggered
by
the
rapidity
with
which
the
transaction
was
carried
through
the
theater
was
his
before
he
had
time
to
realize
that
he
had
never
meant
to
buy
the
thing
at
all
he
had
gone
into
the
offices
of
montague
with
the
intention
of
making
an
offer
for
the
lease
for
say
six
months
and
that
wizard
in
the
space
of
less
than
an
hour
had
not
only
induced
him
to
sign
mysterious
documents
which
made
him
sole
proprietor
of
the
house
but
had
left
him
with
the
feeling
that
he
had
done
an
extremely
acute
stroke
of
business
montague
had
dabbled
in
many
professions
in
his
time
from
street
peddling
upward
but
what
he
was
really
best
at
was
hypnotism
altho
he
felt
after
the
spell
of
montague
magnetism
was
withdrawn
rather
like
a
nervous
man
who
has
been
given
a
large
baby
to
hold
by
a
strange
woman
who
has
promptly
vanished
round
the
corner
roland
was
to
some
extent
consoled
by
the
praise
bestowed
upon
him
by
miss
verepoint
she
said
it
was
much
better
to
buy
a
theater
than
to
rent
it
because
then
you
escaped
the
heavy
rent
it
was
specious
but
roland
had
a
dim
feeling
that
there
was
a
flaw
somewhere
in
the
reasoning
and
it
was
from
this
point
that
a
shadow
may
be
said
to
have
fallen
upon
the
brightness
of
the
venture
he
would
have
been
even
less
if
he
had
known
the
windsor
theater
reputation
being
a
comparative
stranger
in
the
metropolis
he
was
unaware
that
its
nickname
in
theatrical
circles
was
the
mugs
graveyard
a
title
which
had
been
bestowed
upon
it
not
without
reason
built
originally
by
a
slightly
insane
old
gentleman
whose
principal
delusion
was
that
the
public
was
pining
for
a
constant
supply
of
the
higher
drama
and
more
especially
those
specimens
of
the
higher
drama
which
flowed
practically
without
cessation
from
the
restless
pen
of
the
insane
old
gentleman
himself
the
windsor
theater
had
passed
from
hand
to
hand
with
the
agility
of
a
gold
watch
in
a
gathering
of
thieves
the
one
anxiety
of
the
unhappy
man
who
found
himself
by
some
accident
in
possession
of
the
windsor
theater
was
to
pass
it
on
to
somebody
else
the
only
really
permanent
tenant
it
ever
had
was
the
representative
of
the
official
receiver
various
causes
were
assigned
for
the
phenomenal
of
the
theater
but
undoubtedly
the
vital
objection
to
it
as
a
temple
of
drama
lay
in
the
fact
that
nobody
could
ever
find
the
place
where
it
was
hidden
cabmen
shook
their
heads
on
the
rare
occasions
when
they
were
asked
to
take
a
fare
there
explorers
to
whom
a
stroll
through
the
australian
bush
was
had
been
known
to
spend
an
hour
on
its
trail
and
finish
up
at
the
point
where
they
had
started
it
was
precisely
this
quality
of
elusiveness
which
had
first
attracted
montague
he
was
a
man
and
to
him
the
topographical
advantages
of
the
theater
were
enormous
it
was
further
from
a
than
any
other
building
of
the
same
insurance
value
in
london
even
without
having
regard
to
the
mystery
which
enveloped
its
whereabouts
often
after
a
good
dinner
he
would
lean
comfortably
back
in
his
chair
and
see
in
the
smoke
of
his
cigar
a
vision
of
the
windsor
theater
blazing
merrily
while
distracted
firemen
galloped
madly
all
over
london
vainly
endeavoring
to
get
some
one
to
direct
them
to
the
scene
of
the
conflagration
so
montague
bought
the
theater
for
a
mere
song
and
prepared
to
get
busy
unluckily
for
him
the
representatives
of
the
various
fire
offices
with
which
he
had
effected
his
policies
got
busy
first
the
generous
fellows
insisted
upon
taking
off
his
shoulders
the
burden
of
maintaining
the
fireman
whose
permanent
presence
in
a
theater
is
required
by
law
nothing
would
satisfy
them
but
to
install
firemen
of
their
own
and
pay
their
salaries
this
to
a
man
in
whom
the
instincts
of
the
phoenix
were
so
strongly
developed
as
they
were
in
montague
was
distinctly
disconcerting
he
saw
himself
making
no
profit
on
the
deal
a
thing
which
had
never
happened
to
him
before
and
then
roland
bleke
occurred
and
montague
belief
that
his
race
was
really
chosen
was
restored
he
sold
the
windsor
theater
to
roland
for
thousand
pounds
it
was
fifteen
thousand
pounds
more
than
he
himself
had
given
for
it
and
this
very
satisfactory
profit
mitigated
the
slight
regret
which
he
felt
when
it
came
to
transferring
to
roland
the
insurance
policies
to
have
effected
policies
amounting
to
rather
more
than
seventy
thousand
pounds
on
a
building
so
notoriously
valueless
as
the
windsor
theater
had
been
an
achievement
of
which
montague
was
justly
proud
and
it
seemed
sad
to
him
that
so
much
earnest
endeavor
should
be
thrown
away
over
the
little
lunch
with
which
she
kindly
allowed
roland
to
entertain
her
to
celebrate
the
purchase
of
the
theater
miss
verepoint
outlined
her
policy
what
we
must
put
up
at
that
theater
she
announced
is
a
revue
a
revue
repeated
miss
verepoint
making
as
she
spoke
little
calculations
on
the
back
of
the
menu
we
could
run
for
about
fifteen
hundred
a
week
or
say
two
saying
two
thousand
thought
roland
to
himself
is
not
quite
the
same
as
paying
two
thousand
so
why
should
she
stint
herself
i
know
two
boys
who
could
write
us
a
topping
revue
said
miss
verepoint
they
spread
themselves
too
if
it
was
for
me
they
in
love
with
me
both
of
them
we
better
get
in
touch
with
them
at
to
roland
there
seemed
to
be
something
just
the
least
bit
sinister
about
the
sound
of
that
word
touch
but
he
said
nothing
why
there
they
are
lunching
over
there
cried
miss
verepoint
pointing
to
a
neighboring
table
now
is
that
lucky
to
roland
the
luck
was
not
quite
so
apparent
but
he
made
no
demur
to
miss
verepoint
suggestion
that
they
should
be
brought
over
to
their
table
the
two
boys
as
to
whose
capabilities
to
write
a
topping
revue
miss
verepoint
had
formed
so
optimistic
an
estimate
proved
to
be
lads
of
about
and
forty
respectively
of
the
two
roland
thought
that
perhaps
de
parys
was
a
shade
the
more
obnoxious
but
a
closer
inspection
left
him
with
the
feeling
that
these
fine
distinctions
were
a
little
unfair
with
men
of
such
equal
talents
bromham
rhodes
ran
his
friend
so
close
that
it
was
practically
a
dead
heat
they
were
both
fat
and
somewhat
this
was
due
to
the
fact
that
what
exacts
from
its
exponents
is
the
constant
assimilation
of
food
and
drink
bromham
rhodes
had
the
largest
appetite
in
london
but
on
the
other
hand
de
parys
was
a
better
drinker
well
dear
old
thing
said
bromham
rhodes
well
old
child
said
de
parys
both
these
remarks
were
addressed
to
miss
verepoint
the
talented
pair
appeared
to
be
unaware
of
roland
existence
miss
verepoint
struck
the
business
note
now
you
stop
boys
she
said
tie
weights
to
yourselves
and
sink
down
into
those
chairs
i
want
you
two
lads
to
write
a
revue
for
delighted
said
bromham
rhodes
but
there
is
the
trifling
point
to
be
raised
first
said
de
parys
where
is
the
money
coming
from
said
bromham
rhodes
my
friend
bleke
is
putting
up
the
money
said
miss
verepoint
with
dignity
he
has
taken
the
windsor
the
interest
of
the
two
authors
in
their
host
till
then
languid
increased
with
a
jerk
has
he
by
jove
they
cried
we
must
get
together
and
talk
this
it
was
roland
first
experience
of
a
theatrical
and
he
never
forgot
it
two
such
as
bromham
rhodes
and
de
parys
were
scarcely
to
be
found
in
the
length
and
breadth
of
theatrical
london
nothing
it
seemed
could
the
gifted
pair
even
begin
to
think
of
doing
without
first
discussing
the
proposition
in
all
its
aspects
the
amount
of
food
which
roland
found
himself
compelled
to
absorb
during
the
course
of
these
debates
was
appalling
discussions
which
began
at
lunch
would
be
continued
until
it
was
time
to
order
dinner
and
then
as
likely
as
not
they
would
have
to
sit
there
till
in
order
to
thrash
the
question
thoroughly
out
the
collection
of
a
cast
was
a
matter
even
more
complicated
than
the
actual
composition
of
the
revue
there
was
the
almost
insuperable
difficulty
that
miss
verepoint
firmly
vetoed
every
name
suggested
it
seemed
practically
impossible
to
find
any
man
or
woman
in
all
england
or
america
whose
peculiar
gifts
or
lack
of
them
would
not
interfere
with
miss
verepoint
giving
a
satisfactory
performance
of
the
principal
role
it
was
all
very
perplexing
to
roland
but
as
miss
verepoint
was
an
expert
in
theatrical
matters
he
scarcely
felt
entitled
to
question
her
views
it
was
about
this
time
that
roland
proposed
to
miss
verepoint
the
passage
of
time
and
the
strain
of
talking
over
the
revue
had
to
a
certain
extent
moderated
his
original
fervor
he
had
shaded
off
from
a
passionate
devotion
through
various
diminishing
tints
of
regard
for
her
into
a
sort
of
pale
sunset
glow
of
affection
his
principal
reason
for
proposing
was
that
it
seemed
to
him
to
be
in
the
natural
order
of
events
her
air
towards
him
had
become
distinctly
proprietorial
she
now
called
him
in
public
a
proceeding
which
left
him
with
mixed
feelings
also
she
had
taken
to
ordering
him
about
which
as
everybody
knows
is
an
unmistakable
sign
of
affection
among
ladies
of
the
theatrical
profession
finally
in
his
chivalrous
way
roland
had
begun
to
feel
a
little
apprehensive
lest
he
might
be
compromising
miss
verepoint
everybody
knew
that
he
was
putting
up
the
money
for
the
revue
in
which
she
was
to
appear
they
were
constantly
seen
together
at
restaurants
people
looked
arch
when
they
spoke
to
him
about
her
he
had
to
ask
himself
was
he
behaving
like
a
perfect
gentleman
the
answer
was
in
the
negative
he
took
a
cab
to
her
flat
and
proposed
before
he
could
repent
of
his
decision
she
accepted
him
he
was
not
certain
for
a
moment
whether
he
was
glad
or
sorry
but
i
do
want
to
get
married
she
went
on
until
i
have
justified
my
choice
of
a
profession
you
will
have
to
wait
until
i
have
made
a
success
in
this
roland
was
shocked
to
find
himself
hugely
relieved
at
this
concession
the
revue
took
shape
there
did
apparently
exist
a
handful
of
artistes
to
whom
miss
verepoint
had
no
objection
and
these
a
scrubby
but
confident
lot
were
promptly
engaged
sallow
americans
sprang
from
nowhere
with
songs
dances
and
ideas
for
effects
scenic
artists
wandered
in
with
model
scenes
under
their
arms
a
great
cloud
of
settled
upon
the
theater
like
flies
even
bromham
rhodes
and
de
parys
those
human
pythons
showed
signs
of
activity
they
cornered
roland
one
day
near
swan
and
edgar
steered
him
into
the
piccadilly
and
over
a
hearty
lunch
read
him
extracts
from
a
manuscript
which
they
informed
him
was
the
first
act
it
looked
a
battered
sort
of
manuscript
and
indeed
it
had
every
right
to
be
under
various
titles
and
at
various
times
bromham
rhodes
and
de
parys
first
act
had
been
refused
by
practically
every
responsible
manager
in
london
as
oh
what
a
life
it
had
failed
to
satisfy
the
directors
of
the
empire
it
had
been
rejected
by
the
alhambra
the
hippodrome
had
refused
to
consider
it
even
under
the
name
of
hullo
it
was
now
called
pass
along
please
and
according
to
its
authors
was
a
real
revue
roland
was
to
learn
as
the
days
went
on
that
in
the
world
in
which
he
was
moving
everything
was
real
revue
that
was
not
a
stunt
or
a
corking
effect
he
floundered
in
a
sea
of
real
revue
stunts
and
corking
effects
as
far
as
he
could
gather
the
main
difference
between
these
things
was
that
real
revue
was
something
which
had
been
stolen
from
some
previous
english
production
whereas
a
stunt
or
a
corking
effect
was
something
which
had
been
looted
from
new
york
a
judicious
blend
of
these
he
was
given
to
understand
constituted
the
sort
of
thing
the
public
wanted
rehearsals
began
before
in
roland
opinion
his
little
army
was
properly
supplied
with
ammunition
true
they
had
the
first
act
but
even
the
authors
agreed
that
it
wanted
bringing
in
parts
they
explained
that
it
was
in
a
manner
of
speaking
their
that
they
had
actually
started
it
about
ten
years
ago
when
they
were
careless
lads
inevitably
it
was
spotted
here
and
there
with
smart
topical
hits
of
the
early
years
of
the
century
but
that
they
said
would
be
all
right
they
could
freshen
it
up
in
a
couple
of
evenings
it
was
simply
a
matter
of
deleting
allusions
to
and
substituting
lines
about
marconi
shares
and
it
be
all
right
they
assured
roland
this
is
real
in
times
of
trouble
there
is
always
a
point
at
which
one
may
say
here
is
the
beginning
of
the
this
point
came
with
roland
at
the
commencement
of
the
rehearsals
till
then
he
had
not
fully
realized
the
terrible
nature
of
the
production
for
which
he
had
made
himself
responsible
moreover
it
was
rehearsals
which
gave
him
his
first
clear
insight
into
the
character
of
miss
verepoint
miss
verepoint
was
not
at
her
best
at
rehearsals
for
the
first
time
as
he
watched
her
roland
found
himself
feeling
that
there
was
a
case
to
be
made
out
for
the
managers
who
had
so
consistently
kept
her
in
the
background
miss
verepoint
to
use
the
technical
term
threw
her
weight
about
there
were
not
many
good
lines
in
the
script
of
act
one
of
pass
along
please
but
such
as
there
were
she
reached
out
for
and
grabbed
away
from
their
owners
who
retired
into
corners
scowling
and
muttering
like
dogs
robbed
of
bones
she
snubbed
everybody
roland
included
roland
sat
in
the
cold
darkness
of
the
stalls
and
watched
her
like
an
icy
wave
it
had
swept
over
him
what
marriage
with
this
girl
would
mean
he
suddenly
realised
how
essentially
domestic
his
instincts
really
were
life
with
miss
verepoint
would
mean
perpetual
dinners
at
restaurants
suppers
everything
that
he
hated
most
yet
as
a
man
of
honor
he
was
tied
to
her
if
the
revue
was
a
success
she
would
marry
him
and
revues
he
knew
were
always
successes
at
that
very
moment
there
were
six
best
revues
in
london
running
at
various
theaters
he
shuddered
at
the
thought
that
in
a
few
weeks
there
would
be
seven
he
felt
a
longing
for
rural
solitude
he
wanted
to
be
alone
by
himself
for
a
day
or
two
in
a
place
where
there
were
no
papers
with
advertisements
of
revues
no
and
above
all
no
miss
billy
verepoint
that
night
he
stole
away
to
a
norfolk
village
where
in
happier
days
he
had
once
spent
a
summer
holiday
a
peaceful
primitive
place
where
the
inhabitants
could
not
have
told
real
revue
from
a
corking
effect
here
for
the
space
of
a
week
roland
lay
in
hiding
while
his
quivering
nerves
gradually
recovered
tone
he
returned
to
london
happier
but
a
little
apprehensive
beyond
a
brief
telegram
of
farewell
he
had
not
communicated
with
miss
verepoint
for
seven
days
and
experience
had
made
him
aware
that
she
was
a
lady
who
demanded
an
adequate
amount
of
attention
that
his
nervous
system
was
not
wholly
restored
to
health
was
borne
in
upon
him
as
he
walked
along
piccadilly
on
his
way
to
his
flat
for
when
somebody
suddenly
slapped
him
hard
between
the
he
uttered
a
stifled
yell
and
leaped
in
the
air
turning
to
face
his
assailant
he
found
himself
meeting
the
genial
gaze
of
montague
his
predecessor
in
the
ownership
of
the
windsor
theater
montague
was
effusively
friendly
and
for
some
mysterious
reason
congratulatory
you
done
it
have
you
you
pulled
it
off
did
you
and
in
the
first
month
by
george
and
i
took
you
for
the
plain
ordinary
mug
of
commerce
my
boy
you
as
deep
as
they
make
who
have
thought
it
to
look
at
you
it
was
the
greatest
idea
any
one
ever
had
and
staring
me
in
the
face
all
the
time
and
i
never
saw
it
but
i
grudge
it
to
you
you
deserve
it
my
boy
you
a
nut
i
really
do
know
what
you
quite
right
my
boy
chuckled
montague
you
quite
right
to
keep
it
up
even
among
friends
it
do
do
to
risk
anything
and
the
least
said
soonest
he
went
on
his
way
leaving
roland
completely
mystified
voices
from
his
among
which
he
recognized
the
high
note
of
miss
verepoint
reminded
him
of
the
ordeal
before
him
he
entered
with
what
he
hoped
was
a
careless
ease
of
manner
but
his
heart
was
beating
fast
since
the
opening
of
rehearsals
he
had
acquired
a
wholesome
respect
for
miss
verepoint
tongue
she
was
sitting
in
his
favorite
chair
there
were
also
present
bromham
rhodes
and
de
parys
who
had
made
themselves
completely
at
home
with
a
couple
of
his
cigars
and
whisky
from
the
oldest
bin
so
here
you
are
at
last
said
miss
verepoint
querulously
the
valet
told
us
you
were
expected
back
this
morning
so
we
waited
where
on
earth
have
you
been
to
running
away
like
this
without
a
word
i
only
went
well
it
does
matter
where
you
went
the
main
point
is
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
we
thought
we
better
come
along
and
talk
it
over
said
de
parys
talk
what
over
said
roland
the
revue
oh
do
try
and
be
funny
for
goodness
sake
snapped
miss
verepoint
it
does
suit
you
you
have
the
right
shape
of
head
what
do
you
suppose
we
want
to
talk
over
the
theater
of
what
about
the
theater
miss
verepoint
looked
searchingly
at
him
do
you
ever
read
the
papers
i
have
seen
a
paper
since
i
went
well
better
have
it
quick
and
not
waste
time
breaking
it
gently
said
miss
verepoint
the
theater
been
burned
down
that
burned
down
burned
down
repeated
roland
that
what
i
said
did
i
the
suffragettes
did
it
they
left
copies
of
for
women
about
the
place
the
silly
asses
set
fire
to
two
other
theaters
as
well
but
they
happened
to
be
in
main
thoroughfares
and
the
got
them
under
control
at
once
i
suppose
they
could
find
the
windsor
anyhow
it
burned
to
the
ground
and
what
we
want
to
know
is
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
roland
was
much
too
busy
blessing
the
good
angels
of
kingsway
to
reply
at
once
de
parys
sympathetic
soul
placed
a
wrong
construction
on
his
silence
poor
old
roly
he
said
it
quite
broken
him
up
the
best
thing
we
can
do
is
all
to
go
off
and
talk
it
over
at
the
savoy
over
a
bit
of
well
said
miss
verepoint
what
are
you
going
to
do
rebuild
the
windsor
or
try
and
get
another
theater
the
authors
were
all
for
rebuilding
the
windsor
true
it
would
take
time
but
it
would
be
more
satisfactory
in
every
way
besides
at
this
time
of
the
year
it
would
be
no
easy
matter
to
secure
another
theater
at
a
moment
notice
to
de
parys
and
bromham
rhodes
the
destruction
of
the
windsor
theater
had
appeared
less
in
the
light
of
a
disaster
than
as
a
direct
intervention
on
the
part
of
providence
the
completion
of
that
tiresome
second
act
which
had
brooded
over
their
lives
like
an
ugly
cloud
could
now
be
postponed
indefinitely
of
course
said
de
parys
thoughtfully
our
contract
with
you
makes
it
obligatory
on
you
to
produce
our
revue
by
a
certain
date
but
i
dare
say
bromham
we
could
meet
roly
there
could
we
sure
said
rhodes
something
nominal
say
a
further
five
hundred
on
account
of
fees
would
satisfy
us
i
certainly
think
it
would
be
better
to
rebuild
the
windsor
do
you
i
do
agreed
de
parys
cordially
you
see
roly
our
revue
has
been
written
to
fit
the
windsor
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
alter
it
for
production
at
another
theater
yes
i
feel
sure
that
rebuilding
the
windsor
would
be
your
best
there
was
a
pause
what
do
you
think
asked
miss
verepoint
as
roland
made
no
sign
nothing
would
delight
me
more
than
to
rebuild
the
windsor
or
to
take
another
theater
or
do
anything
else
to
oblige
he
said
cheerfully
unfortunately
i
have
no
more
money
to
it
was
as
if
a
bomb
had
suddenly
exploded
in
the
room
a
dreadful
silence
fell
upon
his
hearers
for
the
moment
no
one
spoke
de
parys
woke
with
a
start
out
of
a
beautiful
dream
of
prawn
curry
and
bromham
rhodes
forgot
that
he
had
not
tasted
food
for
nearly
two
hours
miss
verepoint
was
the
first
to
break
the
silence
do
you
mean
to
say
she
gasped
that
you
did
insure
the
place
roland
shook
his
head
the
particular
form
in
which
miss
verepoint
had
put
the
question
entitled
him
he
felt
to
make
this
answer
why
did
you
miss
verepoint
tone
was
almost
menacing
because
it
did
not
appear
to
me
to
be
nor
was
it
necessary
said
roland
to
his
conscience
montague
had
done
all
the
insuring
that
was
necessary
and
a
bit
over
miss
verepoint
fought
with
her
growing
indignation
and
lost
what
about
the
salaries
of
the
people
who
have
been
rehearsing
all
this
time
she
demanded
i
sorry
that
they
should
be
out
of
an
engagement
but
it
is
scarcely
my
fault
however
i
propose
to
give
each
of
them
a
month
salary
i
can
manage
that
i
miss
verepoint
rose
and
what
about
me
what
about
me
that
what
i
want
to
know
where
do
i
get
off
if
you
think
i
going
to
marry
you
without
your
getting
a
theater
and
putting
up
this
revue
you
jolly
well
roland
made
a
gesture
which
was
intended
to
convey
regret
and
resignation
he
even
contrived
to
sigh
very
well
then
said
miss
verepoint
rightly
interpreting
this
behavior
as
his
final
pronouncement
on
the
situation
then
jolly
well
she
swept
out
of
the
room
the
two
authors
following
in
her
wake
like
porpoises
behind
a
liner
roland
went
to
his
bureau
unlocked
it
and
took
out
a
bundle
of
documents
he
let
his
fingers
stray
lovingly
among
the
fire
insurance
policies
which
energetic
montague
had
been
at
such
pains
to
secure
from
so
many
companies
and
so
he
said
softly
to
himself
am
the
episode
of
the
live
weekly
fourth
of
a
series
of
six
stories
first
published
in
august
it
was
with
a
start
that
roland
bleke
realized
that
the
girl
at
the
other
end
of
the
bench
was
crying
for
the
last
few
minutes
as
far
as
his
preoccupation
allowed
him
to
notice
them
at
all
he
had
been
attributing
the
subdued
sniffs
to
a
summer
cold
having
just
recovered
from
one
himself
he
was
embarrassed
he
blamed
the
fate
that
had
led
him
to
this
particular
bench
but
he
wished
to
give
himself
up
to
quiet
deliberation
on
the
question
of
what
on
earth
he
was
to
do
with
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
pounds
to
which
figure
his
fortune
had
now
risen
the
sniffs
continued
roland
discomfort
increased
chivalry
had
always
been
his
weakness
in
the
old
days
on
a
hundred
and
forty
pounds
a
year
he
had
had
few
opportunities
of
indulging
himself
in
this
direction
but
now
it
seemed
to
him
sometimes
that
the
whole
world
was
crying
out
for
assistance
should
he
speak
to
her
he
wanted
to
but
only
a
few
days
ago
his
eyes
had
been
caught
by
the
placard
of
a
weekly
paper
bearing
the
title
of
on
which
in
large
letters
was
the
legend
men
who
speak
to
girls
and
he
had
gathered
that
the
accompanying
article
was
a
denunciation
rather
than
a
eulogy
of
these
individuals
on
the
other
hand
she
was
obviously
in
distress
another
sniff
decided
him
i
say
you
know
he
said
the
girl
looked
at
him
she
was
small
and
at
the
present
moment
had
that
air
of
the
floweret
surprized
while
shrinking
which
adds
a
good
per
cent
to
a
girl
attractions
her
nose
he
noted
was
delicately
a
certain
pallor
added
to
her
beauty
heart
executed
the
opening
steps
of
a
dance
pardon
me
he
went
on
but
you
appear
to
be
in
trouble
is
there
anything
i
can
do
for
you
she
looked
at
him
again
a
keen
look
which
seemed
to
get
into
soul
and
walk
about
it
with
a
searchlight
then
as
if
satisfied
by
the
inspection
she
spoke
no
i
do
think
there
is
she
said
unless
you
happen
to
be
the
proprietor
of
a
weekly
paper
with
a
woman
page
and
need
an
editress
for
i
do
well
that
all
any
one
could
do
for
me
give
me
back
my
work
or
give
me
something
else
of
the
same
oh
have
you
lost
your
job
i
have
so
would
you
mind
going
away
because
i
want
to
go
on
crying
and
i
do
it
better
alone
you
wo
mind
my
turning
you
out
i
hope
but
i
was
here
first
and
there
are
heaps
of
other
no
but
wait
a
minute
i
want
to
hear
about
this
i
might
be
able
what
i
mean
is
think
of
something
tell
me
all
about
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
possession
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
pounds
tones
down
a
diffident
man
diffidence
roland
began
to
feel
almost
masterful
why
should
i
why
should
you
there
something
in
that
said
the
girl
reflectively
after
all
you
might
know
somebody
well
as
you
want
to
know
i
have
just
been
discharged
from
a
paper
called
i
used
to
edit
the
by
jove
did
you
write
that
article
on
who
speak
the
hard
manner
in
which
she
had
wrapped
herself
as
in
a
garment
vanished
instantly
her
eyes
softened
she
even
blushed
just
a
becoming
pink
you
know
you
do
mean
to
say
you
read
it
i
did
think
that
any
one
ever
really
read
read
it
cried
roland
recklessly
abandoning
truth
i
should
jolly
well
think
so
i
know
it
by
heart
do
you
mean
to
say
that
after
an
article
like
that
they
actually
sacked
you
threw
you
out
as
a
failure
oh
they
did
send
me
away
for
incompetence
it
was
simply
because
they
could
afford
to
keep
me
on
petheram
was
very
nice
about
who
petheram
mr
petheram
everything
he
calls
himself
the
editor
but
he
really
everything
except
and
i
expect
he
be
that
next
week
when
i
started
with
the
paper
there
was
quite
a
large
staff
but
it
got
whittled
down
by
degrees
till
there
was
only
petheram
and
myself
it
was
like
the
crew
of
the
bell
they
got
eaten
one
by
one
till
i
was
the
only
one
left
and
now
i
gone
petheram
is
doing
the
whole
paper
how
is
it
that
he
ca
get
anything
better
to
do
roland
said
he
has
done
lots
of
better
things
he
used
to
be
at
carmelite
house
but
they
thought
he
was
too
roland
felt
relieved
he
conjured
up
a
picture
of
a
elder
with
a
fatherly
manner
oh
he
old
is
he
there
was
a
brief
silence
something
in
the
girl
expression
stung
roland
she
wore
a
rapt
look
as
if
she
were
dreaming
of
the
absent
petheram
confound
him
he
would
show
her
that
petheram
was
not
the
only
man
worth
looking
rapt
about
he
rose
would
you
mind
giving
me
your
address
he
said
why
in
order
said
roland
carefully
that
i
may
offer
you
your
former
employment
on
i
am
going
to
buy
after
all
your
man
of
dash
and
enterprise
your
napoleon
does
have
his
moments
without
looking
at
her
he
perceived
that
he
had
bowled
her
over
completely
something
told
him
that
she
was
staring
at
him
meanwhile
a
voice
within
him
was
muttering
anxiously
i
wonder
how
much
this
is
going
to
you
going
to
buy
her
voice
had
fallen
away
to
an
awestruck
whisper
i
she
gulped
well
i
think
you
so
did
roland
where
will
a
letter
find
you
he
asked
my
name
is
march
bessie
march
i
living
at
guildford
thank
you
good
morning
i
will
communicate
with
you
in
due
he
raised
his
hat
and
walked
away
he
had
only
gone
a
few
steps
when
there
was
a
patter
of
feet
behind
him
he
turned
i
i
just
wanted
to
thank
you
she
said
not
at
all
said
roland
not
at
he
went
on
his
way
tingling
with
just
triumph
petheram
who
was
petheram
who
in
the
name
of
goodness
was
petheram
he
had
put
petheram
in
his
proper
place
he
rather
fancied
petheram
forsooth
laughable
a
copy
of
the
current
number
of
purchased
at
a
informed
him
after
a
minute
search
to
find
the
editorial
page
that
the
offices
of
the
paper
were
in
fetter
lane
it
was
evidence
of
his
exalted
state
of
mind
that
he
proceeded
thither
in
a
cab
fetter
lane
is
one
of
those
streets
in
which
rooms
that
have
only
just
escaped
being
cupboards
by
a
few
feet
achieve
the
dignity
of
offices
there
might
have
been
space
to
swing
a
cat
in
the
editorial
sanctum
of
but
it
would
have
been
a
near
thing
as
for
the
outer
office
in
which
a
lad
of
fifteen
received
roland
and
instructed
him
to
wait
while
he
took
his
card
in
to
petheram
it
was
a
mere
box
roland
was
afraid
to
expand
his
chest
for
fear
of
bruising
it
the
boy
returned
to
say
that
petheram
would
see
him
petheram
was
a
young
man
with
a
mop
of
hair
and
an
air
of
almost
painful
restraint
he
was
in
his
and
the
table
before
him
was
heaped
high
with
papers
opposite
him
evidently
in
the
act
of
taking
his
leave
was
a
man
of
middle
age
with
a
red
face
and
a
short
beard
he
left
as
roland
entered
and
roland
was
surprized
to
see
petheram
spring
to
his
feet
shake
his
fist
at
the
closing
door
and
kick
the
wall
with
a
vehemence
which
brought
down
several
inches
of
discolored
plaster
take
a
seat
he
said
when
he
had
finished
this
performance
what
can
i
do
for
you
roland
had
always
imagined
that
editors
in
their
private
offices
were
less
easily
approached
and
when
approached
more
brusk
the
fact
was
that
petheram
whose
optimism
nothing
could
quench
had
mistaken
him
for
a
prospective
advertiser
i
want
to
buy
the
paper
said
roland
he
was
aware
that
this
was
an
abrupt
way
of
approaching
the
subject
but
after
all
he
did
want
to
buy
the
paper
so
why
not
say
so
petheram
fizzed
in
his
chair
he
glowed
with
excitement
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
there
a
single
in
london
which
has
sold
out
great
scott
perhaps
they
all
sold
out
how
many
did
you
try
i
mean
buy
the
whole
paper
become
proprietor
you
roland
felt
that
he
was
blushing
and
hated
himself
for
it
he
ought
to
be
carrying
this
thing
through
with
an
air
petheram
looked
at
him
blankly
why
he
asked
oh
i
do
know
said
roland
he
felt
the
interview
was
going
all
wrong
it
lacked
a
stateliness
which
this
kind
of
interview
should
have
had
honestly
said
petheram
you
are
pulling
my
leg
roland
nodded
petheram
appeared
to
struggle
with
his
conscience
and
finally
to
be
worsted
by
it
for
his
next
remarks
were
limpidly
honest
do
you
be
an
ass
he
said
you
do
know
what
you
letting
yourself
in
for
did
you
see
that
blighter
who
went
out
just
now
do
you
know
who
he
is
that
the
fellow
we
got
to
pay
five
pounds
a
week
to
for
why
we
ca
get
rid
of
him
when
the
paper
started
the
proprietors
not
the
present
ones
thought
it
would
give
the
thing
a
boom
if
they
had
a
football
competition
with
a
first
prize
of
a
fiver
a
week
for
life
well
that
the
man
who
won
it
he
been
handed
down
as
a
legacy
from
proprietor
to
proprietor
till
now
we
got
him
ages
ago
they
tried
to
get
him
to
compromise
for
a
lump
sum
down
but
he
would
said
he
would
only
spend
it
and
preferred
to
get
it
by
the
week
well
by
the
time
we
paid
that
vampire
there
is
much
left
out
of
our
profits
that
why
we
are
at
the
present
moment
a
little
a
frown
clouded
petheram
brow
roland
wondered
if
he
was
thinking
of
bessie
march
i
know
all
about
that
he
said
and
you
still
want
to
buy
the
thing
but
what
on
earth
for
mind
you
i
ought
not
to
be
crabbing
my
own
paper
like
this
but
you
seem
a
good
chap
and
i
do
want
to
see
you
landed
why
are
you
doing
it
oh
just
for
ah
now
you
talking
if
you
can
afford
expensive
amusements
go
he
put
his
feet
on
the
table
and
lit
a
short
pipe
his
gloomy
views
on
the
subject
of
gave
way
to
a
wave
of
optimism
you
know
he
said
there
really
a
lot
of
life
in
the
old
rag
yet
if
it
were
properly
run
what
has
hampered
us
has
been
lack
of
capital
we
have
been
able
to
advertise
i
bursting
with
ideas
for
booming
the
paper
only
naturally
you
ca
do
it
for
nothing
as
for
editing
what
i
do
know
about
editing
but
perhaps
you
had
got
somebody
else
in
your
mind
no
no
said
roland
who
would
not
have
known
an
editor
from
an
the
thought
of
interviewing
prospective
editors
appalled
him
very
well
then
resumed
petheram
reassured
kicking
over
a
heap
of
papers
to
give
more
room
for
his
feet
take
it
that
i
continue
as
editor
we
can
discuss
terms
later
under
the
present
regime
i
have
been
doing
all
the
work
in
exchange
for
a
happy
home
i
suppose
you
want
to
spoil
the
ship
for
a
of
tar
in
other
words
you
would
sooner
have
a
happy
editor
running
about
the
place
than
a
wreck
who
might
swoon
from
starvation
but
one
moment
said
roland
are
you
sure
that
the
present
proprietors
will
want
to
sell
want
to
sell
cried
petheram
enthusiastically
why
if
they
know
you
want
to
buy
you
as
much
chance
of
getting
away
from
them
without
the
paper
as
as
well
i
ca
think
of
anything
that
has
such
a
poor
chance
of
anything
if
you
are
quick
on
your
feet
they
cry
on
your
shoulder
come
along
and
we
round
them
up
he
struggled
into
his
coat
and
gave
his
hair
an
impatient
brush
with
a
there
just
one
other
thing
said
roland
i
have
been
a
regular
reader
of
for
some
time
and
i
particularly
admire
the
way
in
which
the
woman
page
you
mean
you
want
to
reengage
the
editress
rather
you
could
do
better
i
was
going
to
suggest
it
myself
now
come
along
quick
before
you
change
your
mind
or
wake
within
a
very
few
days
of
becoming
sole
proprietor
of
roland
began
to
feel
much
as
a
man
might
who
a
novice
at
the
art
of
steering
cars
should
find
himself
at
the
wheel
of
a
runaway
motor
young
petheram
had
spoken
nothing
less
than
the
truth
when
he
had
said
that
he
was
full
of
ideas
for
booming
the
paper
the
infusion
of
capital
into
the
business
acted
on
him
like
a
powerful
stimulant
he
exuded
ideas
at
every
pore
roland
first
notion
had
been
to
engage
a
staff
of
contributors
he
was
under
the
impression
that
contributors
were
the
of
a
weekly
journal
petheram
corrected
this
view
he
consented
to
the
purchase
of
a
lurid
serial
story
but
that
was
the
last
concession
he
made
nobody
could
accuse
petheram
of
lack
of
energy
he
was
willing
even
anxious
to
write
the
whole
paper
himself
with
the
exception
of
the
woman
page
now
brightly
conducted
once
more
by
miss
march
what
he
wanted
roland
to
concentrate
himself
upon
was
the
supplying
of
capital
for
ingenious
advertising
schemes
how
would
it
be
he
asked
one
morning
he
always
began
his
remarks
with
how
would
it
be
if
we
paid
a
man
to
walk
down
piccadilly
in
white
with
the
word
painted
in
red
letters
across
his
chest
roland
thought
it
would
certainly
not
be
good
sound
advertising
stunt
urged
petheram
you
do
like
it
all
right
you
the
boss
well
how
would
it
be
to
have
a
squad
of
men
dressed
as
zulus
with
white
shields
bearing
the
legend
see
what
i
mean
have
them
sprinting
along
the
strand
shouting
wah
wah
buy
it
buy
it
it
would
make
people
roland
emerged
from
these
interviews
with
his
skin
crawling
with
modest
apprehension
his
was
a
retiring
nature
and
the
thought
of
zulus
sprinting
down
the
strand
shouting
wah
wah
wah
buy
it
buy
it
with
reference
to
his
personal
property
appalled
him
he
was
beginning
now
heartily
to
regret
having
bought
the
paper
as
he
generally
regretted
every
definite
step
which
he
took
the
glow
of
romance
which
had
sustained
him
during
the
preliminary
negotiations
had
faded
entirely
a
girl
has
to
be
possessed
of
unusual
charm
to
continue
to
captivate
b
when
she
makes
it
plain
daily
that
her
heart
is
the
exclusive
property
of
a
and
roland
had
long
since
ceased
to
cherish
any
delusion
that
bessie
march
was
ever
likely
to
feel
anything
but
a
mild
liking
for
him
young
petheram
had
obviously
staked
out
an
indisputable
claim
her
attitude
toward
him
was
that
of
an
affectionate
devotee
toward
a
high
priest
one
morning
entering
the
office
unexpectedly
roland
found
her
kissing
the
top
of
petheram
head
and
from
that
moment
his
interest
in
the
fortunes
of
sank
to
zero
it
amazed
him
that
he
could
ever
have
been
idiot
enough
to
have
allowed
himself
to
be
entangled
in
this
insane
venture
for
the
sake
of
an
bit
of
a
girl
with
a
and
a
poor
complexion
what
particularly
galled
him
was
the
fact
that
he
was
throwing
away
good
cash
for
nothing
it
was
true
that
his
capital
was
more
than
equal
to
the
on
the
whole
modest
demands
of
the
paper
but
that
did
not
alter
the
fact
that
he
was
wasting
money
petheram
always
talked
buoyantly
about
turning
the
corner
but
the
corner
always
seemed
just
as
far
off
the
old
idea
of
flight
to
which
he
invariably
had
recourse
in
any
crisis
came
upon
roland
with
irresistible
force
he
packed
a
bag
and
went
to
paris
there
in
the
discomforts
of
life
in
a
foreign
country
he
contrived
for
a
month
to
forget
his
white
elephant
he
returned
by
the
evening
train
which
deposits
the
traveler
in
london
in
time
for
dinner
strangely
enough
nothing
was
farther
from
roland
mind
than
his
bright
weekly
paper
as
he
sat
down
to
dine
in
a
crowded
near
piccadilly
circus
four
weeks
of
acute
torment
in
a
city
where
nobody
seemed
to
understand
the
simplest
english
sentence
had
driven
completely
from
his
mind
for
the
time
being
the
fact
that
such
a
paper
existed
was
brought
home
to
him
with
the
coffee
a
note
was
placed
upon
his
table
by
the
attentive
waiter
what
this
he
asked
the
lady
sare
said
the
waiter
vaguely
roland
looked
round
the
room
excitedly
the
spirit
of
romance
gripped
him
there
were
many
ladies
present
for
this
particular
restaurant
was
a
favorite
with
artistes
who
were
permitted
to
look
in
at
their
theaters
as
late
as
none
of
them
looked
particularly
yet
one
of
them
had
sent
him
this
quite
unsolicited
tribute
he
tore
open
the
envelope
the
message
written
in
a
flowing
feminine
hand
was
brief
and
grundy
herself
could
have
taken
no
exception
to
it
one
penny
weekly
buy
it
it
ran
all
the
mellowing
effects
of
a
good
dinner
passed
away
from
roland
he
was
feverishly
irritated
he
paid
his
bill
and
left
the
place
a
visit
to
a
neighboring
occurred
to
him
as
a
suitable
sedative
hardly
had
his
nerves
ceased
to
quiver
sufficiently
to
allow
him
to
begin
to
enjoy
the
performance
when
in
the
interval
between
two
of
the
turns
a
man
rose
in
one
of
the
side
boxes
is
there
a
doctor
in
the
house
there
was
a
hush
in
the
audience
all
eyes
were
directed
toward
the
box
a
man
in
the
stalls
rose
blushing
and
cleared
his
throat
my
wife
has
fainted
continued
the
speaker
she
has
just
discovered
that
she
has
lost
her
copy
of
the
audience
received
the
statement
with
the
bovine
stolidity
of
an
english
audience
in
the
presence
of
the
unusual
not
so
roland
even
as
the
wended
their
steps
toward
the
box
he
was
rushing
out
into
the
street
as
he
stood
cooling
his
indignation
in
the
pleasant
breeze
which
had
sprung
up
he
was
aware
of
a
dense
crowd
proceeding
toward
him
it
was
headed
by
an
individual
who
shone
out
against
the
drab
background
like
a
good
deed
in
a
naughty
world
nature
hath
framed
strange
fellows
in
her
time
and
this
was
one
of
the
strangest
that
roland
bulging
eyes
had
ever
rested
upon
he
was
a
large
stout
man
comfortably
clad
in
a
suit
of
white
linen
relieved
by
a
scarlet
across
the
bosom
his
at
least
four
sizes
larger
than
any
worn
out
of
a
pantomime
flaunted
the
same
word
in
letters
of
flame
his
umbrella
which
tho
the
weather
was
fine
he
carried
open
above
his
head
bore
the
device
one
penny
weekly
the
arrest
of
this
person
by
a
vigilant
policeman
and
roland
dive
into
a
taxicab
occurred
simultaneously
roland
was
blushing
all
over
his
head
was
in
a
whirl
he
took
the
evening
paper
handed
in
through
the
window
of
the
cab
quite
mechanically
and
it
was
only
the
strong
exhortations
of
the
vendor
which
eventually
induced
him
to
pay
for
it
this
he
did
with
a
sovereign
and
the
cab
drove
off
he
was
just
thinking
of
going
to
bed
several
hours
later
when
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
had
not
read
his
paper
he
glanced
at
the
first
page
the
middle
column
was
devoted
to
a
really
capitally
written
account
of
the
proceedings
at
bow
street
consequent
upon
the
arrest
of
six
men
who
it
was
alleged
had
caused
a
crowd
to
collect
to
the
disturbance
of
the
peace
by
parading
the
strand
in
the
undress
of
zulu
warriors
shouting
in
unison
the
words
wah
wah
wah
buy
young
petheram
greeted
roland
with
a
joyous
enthusiasm
which
the
hound
argus
on
the
return
of
ulysses
might
have
equalled
but
could
scarcely
have
surpassed
it
seemed
to
be
petheram
considered
opinion
that
god
was
in
his
heaven
and
all
was
right
with
the
world
roland
attempts
to
correct
this
belief
fell
on
deaf
ears
have
i
seen
the
advertisements
he
cried
echoing
his
editor
first
question
i
seen
nothing
there
said
petheram
proudly
it
ca
go
yes
it
can
do
you
worry
i
know
they
arrested
as
fast
as
we
send
them
out
but
bless
you
the
supply
endless
ever
since
the
revue
boom
started
and
actors
were
expected
to
do
six
different
parts
in
seven
minutes
there
are
platoons
of
hanging
about
the
strand
ready
to
take
on
any
sort
of
job
you
offer
them
i
have
a
special
staff
flushing
the
bodegas
these
fellows
love
it
it
meat
and
drink
to
them
to
be
right
in
the
public
eye
like
that
makes
them
feel
ten
years
younger
it
wonderful
the
talent
knocking
about
those
zulus
used
to
have
a
steady
job
as
the
six
brothers
biff
society
contortionists
the
revue
craze
killed
them
professionally
they
cried
like
children
when
we
took
them
on
by
the
way
could
you
put
through
an
expenses
cheque
before
you
go
the
fines
mount
up
a
bit
but
do
you
worry
about
that
either
coining
money
i
show
you
the
returns
in
a
minute
i
told
you
we
should
turn
the
corner
turned
it
blame
me
we
whizzed
round
it
on
two
wheels
have
you
had
time
to
see
the
paper
since
you
got
back
no
then
you
have
seen
our
new
scandal
page
just
want
to
know
you
know
it
a
corker
and
it
sent
the
circulation
up
like
a
rocket
everybody
reads
now
i
was
hoping
you
would
come
back
soon
i
wanted
to
ask
you
about
taking
new
offices
we
a
bit
above
this
sort
of
thing
roland
meanwhile
was
reading
with
horrified
eyes
the
alleged
corking
scandal
page
it
seemed
to
him
without
exception
the
most
frightful
production
he
had
ever
seen
it
appalled
him
this
is
awful
he
moaned
we
shall
have
a
hundred
libel
oh
no
that
all
right
it
all
fake
stuff
tho
the
public
know
it
if
you
stuck
to
real
scandals
you
would
get
a
par
a
week
a
more
moral
set
of
blameless
wasters
than
the
blighters
who
constitute
modern
society
you
never
struck
but
it
reads
all
right
does
it
of
course
every
now
and
then
one
does
hear
something
genuine
and
then
it
goes
in
for
instance
have
you
ever
heard
of
percy
pook
the
bookie
i
have
got
a
real
ripe
thing
in
about
percy
this
week
the
absolute
limpid
truth
it
will
make
him
sit
up
a
bit
there
just
under
your
roland
removed
his
thumb
and
having
read
the
paragraph
in
question
started
as
if
he
had
removed
it
from
a
snake
but
this
is
bound
to
mean
a
libel
action
he
cried
not
a
bit
of
it
said
petheram
comfortably
you
do
know
percy
i
wo
bore
you
with
his
but
take
it
from
me
he
rush
into
a
court
of
law
from
sheer
love
of
it
you
safe
but
it
appeared
that
pook
tho
coy
in
the
matter
of
cleansing
his
scutcheon
before
a
judge
and
jury
was
not
wholly
without
weapons
of
defense
and
offense
arriving
at
the
office
next
day
roland
found
a
scene
of
desolation
in
the
middle
of
which
like
marius
among
the
ruins
of
carthage
sat
jimmy
the
office
boy
jimmy
was
reading
an
illustrated
comic
paper
and
appeared
undisturbed
by
his
surroundings
he
gorn
he
observed
looking
up
as
roland
entered
what
do
you
mean
roland
snapped
at
him
who
gone
and
where
did
he
go
and
besides
that
when
you
speak
to
your
superiors
you
will
rise
and
stop
chewing
that
infernal
gum
it
gets
on
my
jimmy
neither
rose
nor
relinquished
his
gum
he
took
his
time
and
answered
mr
petheram
a
couple
of
fellers
come
in
and
went
through
and
there
was
a
uproar
inside
there
and
presently
out
they
come
running
and
i
went
in
and
there
was
petheram
on
the
floor
knocked
silly
and
the
furniture
all
broke
and
now
gorn
to
those
fellers
been
putting
froo
it
proper
concluded
jimmy
with
moody
relish
roland
sat
down
weakly
jimmy
his
tale
told
resumed
the
study
of
his
illustrated
paper
silence
reigned
in
the
offices
of
it
was
broken
by
the
arrival
of
miss
march
her
exclamation
of
astonishment
at
the
sight
of
the
wrecked
room
led
to
a
repetition
of
jimmy
story
she
vanished
on
hearing
the
name
of
the
hospital
to
which
the
stricken
editor
had
been
removed
and
returned
an
hour
later
with
flashing
eyes
and
a
set
jaw
aubrey
she
said
it
was
news
to
roland
that
petheram
name
was
aubrey
is
very
much
knocked
about
but
he
is
conscious
and
sitting
up
and
taking
that
in
a
spoon
ah
said
roland
the
doctor
says
he
will
not
be
out
for
a
week
aubrey
is
certain
it
was
that
horrible
men
who
did
it
but
of
course
he
can
prove
nothing
but
his
last
words
to
me
were
it
into
percy
again
this
week
he
has
given
me
one
or
two
things
to
mention
i
do
understand
them
but
aubrey
says
they
will
make
him
roland
flesh
crept
the
idea
of
making
pook
any
wilder
than
he
appeared
to
be
at
present
horrified
him
panic
gave
him
strength
and
he
addressed
miss
march
who
was
looking
more
like
a
modern
joan
of
arc
than
anything
else
on
earth
firmly
miss
march
he
said
i
realize
that
this
is
a
crisis
and
that
we
must
all
do
all
that
we
can
for
the
paper
and
i
am
ready
to
do
anything
in
reason
but
i
will
not
slip
it
into
percy
you
have
seen
the
effects
of
slipping
it
into
percy
what
he
or
his
minions
will
do
if
we
repeat
the
process
i
do
not
care
to
you
are
afraid
yes
said
roland
simply
miss
march
turned
on
her
heel
it
was
plain
that
she
regarded
him
as
a
worm
roland
did
not
like
being
thought
a
worm
but
it
was
infinitely
better
than
being
regarded
as
an
interesting
case
by
the
of
a
hospital
he
belonged
to
the
school
of
thought
which
holds
that
it
is
better
that
people
should
say
of
you
there
he
goes
than
that
they
should
say
how
peaceful
he
looks
stress
of
work
prevented
further
conversation
it
was
a
revelation
to
roland
the
vigor
and
energy
with
which
miss
march
threw
herself
into
the
breach
as
a
matter
of
fact
so
tremendous
had
been
the
labors
of
the
departed
petheram
that
her
work
was
more
apparent
than
real
thanks
to
petheram
there
was
a
sufficient
supply
of
material
in
hand
to
enable
to
run
a
fortnight
on
its
own
momentum
roland
however
did
not
know
this
and
with
a
view
to
doing
what
little
he
could
to
help
he
informed
miss
march
that
he
would
write
the
scandal
page
it
must
be
added
that
the
offer
was
due
quite
as
much
to
prudence
as
to
chivalry
roland
simply
did
not
dare
to
trust
her
with
the
scandal
page
in
her
present
mood
it
was
not
safe
to
slip
it
into
percy
would
he
felt
be
with
her
the
work
of
a
moment
literary
composition
had
never
been
roland
forte
he
sat
and
stared
at
the
white
paper
and
chewed
the
pencil
which
should
have
been
marring
its
whiteness
with
stinging
paragraphs
no
sort
of
idea
came
to
him
his
brow
grew
damp
what
sort
of
people
except
did
things
you
could
write
scandal
about
as
far
as
he
could
ascertain
nobody
he
picked
up
the
morning
paper
the
name
windlebird
caught
his
eye
a
kind
of
pleasant
melancholy
came
over
him
as
he
read
the
paragraph
how
long
ago
it
seemed
since
he
had
met
that
genial
financier
the
paragraph
was
not
particularly
interesting
it
gave
a
brief
account
of
some
large
deal
which
windlebird
was
negotiating
roland
did
not
understand
a
word
of
it
but
it
gave
him
an
idea
he
is
a
character
in
the
second
episode
a
fraudulent
financier
windlebird
financial
standing
he
knew
was
above
suspicion
windlebird
had
made
that
clear
to
him
during
his
visit
there
could
be
no
possibility
of
offending
windlebird
by
a
paragraph
or
two
about
the
manners
and
customs
of
financiers
phrases
which
his
kindly
host
had
used
during
his
visit
came
back
to
him
and
with
them
inspiration
within
five
minutes
he
had
compiled
the
following
we
just
want
to
know
you
know
who
is
the
eminent
financier
at
present
engaged
upon
one
of
his
biggest
deals
whether
the
public
would
not
be
to
look
a
little
closer
into
it
before
investing
their
money
if
it
is
not
a
fact
that
this
gentleman
has
bought
a
ticket
to
the
argentine
in
case
of
accidents
whether
he
may
not
have
to
use
it
at
any
moment
after
that
it
was
easy
ideas
came
with
a
rush
by
the
end
of
an
hour
he
had
completed
a
scandal
page
of
which
petheram
himself
might
have
been
proud
without
a
suggestion
of
slipping
it
into
percy
he
felt
that
he
could
go
to
pook
and
say
percy
on
your
honor
as
a
british
have
i
slipped
it
into
you
in
any
way
whatsoever
and
pook
would
be
compelled
to
reply
you
have
miss
march
read
the
proofs
of
the
page
and
sniffed
but
miss
blood
was
up
and
she
would
have
sniffed
at
anything
not
directly
hostile
to
pook
a
week
later
roland
sat
in
the
office
of
reading
a
letter
it
had
been
sent
from
no
bream
buildings
but
from
point
of
view
it
might
have
come
direct
from
heaven
for
its
contents
signed
by
harrison
harrison
harrison
harrison
solicitors
were
to
the
effect
that
a
client
of
theirs
had
instructed
them
to
approach
him
with
a
view
to
purchasing
the
paper
he
would
not
find
their
client
disposed
to
haggle
over
terms
so
hoped
harrison
harrison
harrison
harrison
in
the
event
of
roland
being
willing
to
sell
they
could
speedily
bring
matters
to
a
satisfactory
conclusion
any
conclusion
which
had
left
him
free
of
without
actual
pecuniary
loss
would
have
been
satisfactory
to
roland
he
had
conceived
a
loathing
for
his
property
which
not
even
its
steadily
increasing
sales
could
mitigate
he
was
around
at
harrison
office
as
soon
as
a
swift
taxi
could
take
him
there
the
lawyers
were
for
spinning
the
thing
out
with
guarded
remarks
and
cautious
preambles
but
roland
methods
of
doing
business
were
always
rapid
this
chap
he
said
this
fellow
who
wants
to
buy
what
he
give
that
began
one
of
the
harrisons
ponderously
would
of
course
largely
depend
i
take
five
thousand
lock
stock
and
barrel
including
the
present
staff
an
even
five
thousand
how
that
five
thousand
is
a
large
take
it
or
leave
my
dear
sir
you
hold
a
pistol
to
our
heads
however
i
think
that
our
client
might
consent
to
the
sum
you
good
well
directly
i
get
his
check
the
thing
his
by
the
way
who
is
your
client
harrison
coughed
his
name
he
said
will
be
familiar
to
you
he
is
the
eminent
financier
geoffrey
the
diverting
episode
of
the
exiled
monarch
fifth
of
a
series
of
six
stories
first
published
in
september
the
caoutchouc
was
drawing
all
london
slightly
more
indecent
than
the
salome
dance
a
shade
less
reticent
than
ragtime
it
had
driven
the
tango
out
of
existence
nor
indeed
did
anybody
actually
caoutchouc
for
the
national
dance
of
paranoya
contained
three
hundred
and
fifteen
recognized
steps
but
everybody
tried
to
a
new
revue
hullo
caoutchouc
had
been
produced
with
success
and
the
pioneer
of
the
dance
the
peerless
maraquita
a
native
paranoyan
still
performed
it
nightly
at
the
where
she
had
first
broken
loose
the
caoutchouc
fascinated
roland
bleke
maraquita
fascinated
him
more
of
all
the
women
to
whom
he
had
lost
his
heart
at
first
sight
maraquita
had
made
the
firmest
impression
upon
him
she
was
what
is
sometimes
called
a
fine
woman
she
had
large
flashing
eyes
the
physique
of
a
rugby
international
forward
and
the
agility
of
a
cat
on
hot
bricks
there
is
a
period
of
about
fifty
steps
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
the
three
hundred
and
fifteen
where
the
patient
abandoning
the
comparative
decorum
of
the
earlier
movements
whizzes
about
till
she
looks
like
a
whirlwind
that
was
the
bit
that
hit
roland
night
after
night
he
sat
in
his
goggling
at
maraquita
and
applauding
wildly
one
night
an
attendant
came
to
his
box
excuse
me
sir
but
are
you
roland
bleke
the
senorita
maraquita
wishes
to
speak
to
he
held
open
the
door
of
the
box
the
possibility
of
refusal
did
not
appear
to
occur
to
him
behind
the
scenes
at
that
theater
it
was
generally
recognized
that
when
the
peerless
one
wanted
a
thing
she
got
it
quick
they
were
alone
with
no
protective
footlights
between
himself
and
her
roland
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
it
was
not
that
she
was
any
less
beautiful
at
the
very
close
quarters
imposed
by
the
limits
of
the
but
he
felt
that
in
falling
in
love
with
her
he
had
undertaken
a
contract
a
little
too
large
for
one
of
his
quiet
diffident
nature
it
crossed
his
mind
that
the
sort
of
woman
he
really
liked
was
the
rather
small
drooping
type
dynamite
would
not
have
made
maraquita
droop
for
perhaps
a
minute
and
a
half
maraquita
fixed
her
compelling
eyes
on
his
without
uttering
a
word
then
she
broke
a
painful
silence
with
this
leading
question
you
love
me
roland
nodded
feebly
when
men
make
love
to
me
i
send
them
away
she
waved
her
hand
toward
the
door
and
roland
began
to
feel
almost
cheerful
again
he
was
to
be
dismissed
with
a
caution
after
all
the
woman
had
a
fine
forgiving
nature
but
not
not
me
no
not
you
you
are
the
man
i
have
been
waiting
for
i
read
about
you
in
the
paper
senor
bleke
i
see
your
picture
in
the
mirror
i
say
to
myself
a
man
those
photographs
always
make
one
look
rather
weird
mumbled
roland
i
see
you
night
after
night
in
your
box
poof
i
love
thanks
awfully
bleated
roland
you
would
do
anything
for
my
sake
i
knew
you
were
that
kind
of
man
directly
i
see
you
no
she
added
as
roland
writhed
uneasily
in
his
chair
do
not
embrace
me
later
yes
but
now
no
not
till
the
great
what
the
great
day
might
be
roland
could
not
even
faintly
conjecture
he
could
only
hope
that
it
would
also
be
a
remote
one
and
now
said
the
senorita
throwing
a
cloak
about
her
shoulders
you
come
away
with
me
to
my
house
my
friends
are
there
awaiting
us
they
will
be
glad
and
proud
to
meet
after
his
first
inspection
of
the
house
and
the
friends
roland
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
preferred
maraquita
room
to
her
company
the
former
was
large
and
airy
the
latter
with
one
exception
small
and
hairy
the
exception
maraquita
addressed
as
bombito
he
was
a
conspicuous
figure
he
was
one
of
those
men
one
suspected
him
of
carrying
lethal
weapons
maraquita
presented
roland
to
the
company
the
native
speech
of
paranoya
sounded
like
shorthand
with
a
blend
of
spanish
an
expert
could
evidently
squeeze
a
good
deal
of
it
into
a
minute
its
effect
on
the
company
was
good
they
were
manifestly
soothed
even
bombito
introductions
in
detail
then
took
place
this
time
for
benefit
maraquita
spoke
in
english
and
he
learned
that
most
of
those
present
were
marquises
before
him
so
he
gathered
from
maraquita
stood
the
very
flower
of
paranoya
aristocracy
driven
from
their
native
land
by
the
infamy
of
roland
was
too
polite
to
inquire
what
on
earth
the
infamy
of
might
be
but
its
mention
had
a
marked
effect
on
the
company
some
scowled
others
uttered
oaths
bombito
did
both
before
supper
to
which
they
presently
sat
down
was
over
however
roland
knew
a
good
deal
about
paranoya
and
its
history
the
conversation
conducted
by
maraquita
to
a
ceaseless
accompaniment
from
her
friends
bore
exclusively
upon
the
subject
paranoya
had
it
appeared
existed
fairly
peacefully
for
centuries
under
the
rule
of
the
alejandro
dynasty
then
in
the
reign
of
alejandro
the
thirteenth
disaffection
had
begun
to
spread
culminating
in
the
infamy
of
which
roland
had
at
last
discovered
was
nothing
less
than
the
abolition
of
the
monarchy
and
the
installation
of
a
republic
since
the
one
thing
for
which
they
had
lived
besides
the
caoutchouc
was
to
see
the
monarchy
restored
and
their
beloved
alejandro
the
thirteenth
back
on
his
throne
their
efforts
toward
this
end
had
been
untiring
and
were
at
last
showing
signs
of
bearing
fruit
paranoya
maraquita
assured
roland
was
honeycombed
with
intrigue
the
army
was
disaffected
the
people
anxious
for
a
return
to
the
old
order
of
things
a
more
propitious
moment
for
striking
the
decisive
blow
was
never
likely
to
arrive
the
question
was
purely
one
of
funds
at
the
mention
of
the
word
funds
roland
who
had
become
thoroughly
bored
with
the
lecture
on
paranoyan
history
sat
up
and
took
notice
he
had
an
instinctive
feeling
that
he
was
about
to
be
called
upon
for
a
subscription
to
the
cause
of
the
distressful
country
freedom
especially
by
bombito
he
was
right
a
moment
later
maraquita
began
to
make
a
speech
she
spoke
in
paranoyan
and
roland
could
not
follow
her
but
he
gathered
that
it
somehow
had
reference
to
himself
as
at
the
end
of
it
the
entire
company
rose
to
their
feet
and
extended
their
glasses
toward
him
with
a
mighty
shout
he
assumed
that
maraquita
had
been
proposing
his
health
they
say
the
liberator
of
paranoya
kindly
translated
the
peerless
one
you
must
excuse
said
maraquita
tolerantly
as
a
bevy
of
patriots
surrounded
roland
and
kissed
him
on
the
cheek
they
are
so
grateful
to
the
savior
of
our
country
i
myself
would
kiss
you
were
it
not
that
i
have
sworn
that
no
man
lips
shall
touch
mine
till
the
royal
standard
floats
once
more
above
the
palace
of
paranoya
but
that
will
be
soon
very
soon
she
went
on
with
you
on
our
side
we
can
not
what
did
the
woman
mean
roland
asked
himself
wildly
did
she
labor
under
the
distressing
delusion
that
he
proposed
to
shed
his
blood
on
behalf
of
a
deposed
monarch
to
whom
he
had
never
been
introduced
maraquita
next
remarks
made
the
matter
clear
i
have
told
them
she
said
that
you
love
me
that
you
are
willing
to
risk
everything
for
my
sake
i
have
promised
them
that
you
the
rich
senor
bleke
will
supply
the
funds
for
the
revolution
once
more
comrades
to
the
savior
of
paranoya
roland
tried
his
hardest
to
catch
the
infection
of
this
patriotic
enthusiasm
but
somehow
he
could
not
do
it
base
sordid
mercenary
speculations
would
intrude
themselves
about
how
much
was
a
good
revolution
likely
to
cost
as
delicately
as
he
could
he
put
the
question
to
maraquita
she
said
poof
the
cost
la
la
which
was
all
very
well
but
hardly
satisfactory
as
a
business
chat
however
that
was
all
roland
could
get
out
of
her
the
next
few
days
passed
for
roland
in
a
sort
of
dream
it
was
the
kind
of
dream
which
it
is
not
easy
to
distinguish
from
a
nightmare
maraquita
reticence
at
the
on
the
subject
of
details
connected
with
the
financial
side
of
revolutions
entirely
disappeared
she
now
talked
nothing
but
figures
and
from
the
confused
mass
which
she
presented
to
him
roland
was
able
to
gather
that
in
financing
the
restoration
of
royalty
in
paranoya
he
would
indeed
be
risking
everything
for
her
sake
in
the
matter
of
revolutions
maraquita
was
no
niggard
she
knew
how
the
thing
should
be
done
well
or
not
at
all
there
would
be
so
much
for
rifles
and
what
not
and
there
would
be
so
much
for
the
expense
of
smuggling
them
into
the
country
then
there
would
be
so
much
to
be
laid
out
in
corrupting
the
republican
army
roland
brightened
a
little
when
they
came
to
this
item
as
the
standing
army
of
paranoya
amounted
to
twenty
thousand
men
and
as
it
seemed
possible
to
corrupt
it
thoroughly
at
a
cost
of
about
thirty
shillings
a
head
the
obvious
course
to
roland
way
of
thinking
was
to
concentrate
on
this
side
of
the
question
and
avoid
unnecessary
bloodshed
it
appeared
however
that
maraquita
did
not
want
to
avoid
bloodshed
that
she
rather
liked
bloodshed
that
the
leaders
of
the
revolution
would
be
disappointed
if
there
were
no
bloodshed
especially
bombito
unless
she
pointed
out
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
carnage
looting
and
so
on
the
revolution
would
not
achieve
a
popular
success
true
the
beloved
alejandro
might
be
restored
but
he
would
sit
upon
a
throne
that
was
insecure
unless
the
coronation
festivities
took
a
bloodthirsty
turn
by
all
means
said
maraquita
corrupt
the
army
but
not
at
the
risk
of
making
the
affair
tame
and
unpopular
paranoya
was
an
emotional
country
and
liked
its
revolutions
with
a
bit
of
zip
to
them
it
was
about
ten
days
after
he
had
definitely
cast
in
his
lot
with
the
revolutionary
party
that
roland
was
made
aware
that
these
things
were
a
little
more
complex
than
he
had
imagined
he
had
reconciled
himself
to
the
financial
outlay
it
had
been
difficult
but
he
had
done
it
that
his
person
as
well
as
his
purse
would
be
placed
in
peril
he
had
not
foreseen
the
fact
was
borne
in
upon
him
at
the
end
of
the
second
week
by
the
arrival
of
the
deputation
it
blew
in
from
the
street
just
as
he
was
enjoying
his
cigar
it
consisted
of
three
men
one
long
and
suave
the
other
two
short
stout
and
silent
they
all
had
the
sallow
complexion
and
undue
hairiness
which
he
had
come
by
this
time
to
associate
with
the
native
of
paranoya
for
a
moment
he
mistook
them
for
a
drove
of
exiled
noblemen
whom
he
had
not
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
at
the
and
he
waited
resignedly
for
them
to
make
night
hideous
with
the
royal
anthem
he
poised
himself
on
his
toes
the
more
readily
to
spring
aside
if
they
should
try
to
kiss
him
on
the
cheek
mr
bleke
said
the
long
man
his
companions
drifted
toward
the
which
stood
open
on
the
table
and
looked
at
it
wistfully
long
live
the
monarchy
said
roland
wearily
he
had
gathered
in
the
course
of
his
dealings
with
the
exiled
ones
that
this
remark
generally
went
well
on
the
present
occasion
it
elicited
no
outburst
of
cheering
on
the
contrary
the
long
man
frowned
and
his
two
companions
helped
themselves
to
a
handful
of
cigars
apiece
with
a
marked
moodiness
death
to
the
monarchy
corrected
the
long
man
coldly
and
he
added
with
a
wealth
of
meaning
in
his
voice
to
all
who
meddle
in
the
affairs
of
our
beloved
country
and
seek
to
do
it
i
do
know
what
you
mean
said
roland
yes
senor
bleke
you
do
know
what
i
mean
i
mean
that
you
will
be
well
advised
to
abandon
the
schemes
which
you
are
hatching
with
the
malcontents
who
would
do
my
beloved
land
an
the
conversation
was
growing
awkward
roland
had
got
so
into
the
habit
of
taking
it
for
granted
that
every
paranoyan
he
met
must
of
necessity
be
a
devotee
of
the
beloved
alejandro
that
it
came
as
a
shock
to
him
to
realize
that
there
were
those
who
objected
to
his
restoration
to
the
throne
till
now
he
had
looked
on
the
enemy
as
something
in
the
abstract
it
had
not
struck
him
that
the
people
for
whose
correction
he
was
buying
all
these
rifles
and
were
individuals
with
a
lively
distaste
for
having
their
blood
shed
senor
bleke
resumed
the
speaker
frowning
at
one
of
his
companions
whose
hand
was
hovering
above
the
bottle
of
liqueur
brandy
you
are
a
man
of
sense
you
know
what
is
safe
and
what
is
not
safe
believe
me
this
scheme
of
yours
is
not
safe
you
have
been
led
away
but
there
is
still
time
to
withdraw
do
so
and
all
is
well
do
not
so
and
your
blood
be
upon
your
own
my
blood
gasped
roland
the
speaker
bowed
that
is
all
he
said
we
merely
came
to
give
the
warning
ah
senor
bleke
do
not
be
rash
you
think
that
here
in
this
great
london
of
yours
you
are
safe
you
look
at
the
policeman
upon
the
corner
of
the
road
and
you
say
to
yourself
am
safe
believe
me
not
at
all
so
is
it
but
much
the
opposite
we
have
ways
by
which
it
is
of
no
account
the
policeman
on
the
corner
of
the
road
that
is
all
senor
bleke
we
wish
you
a
good
the
deputation
withdrew
maraquita
informed
of
the
incident
snapped
her
fingers
and
said
poof
it
sometimes
struck
roland
that
she
would
be
more
real
help
in
a
difficult
situation
if
she
could
get
out
of
the
habit
of
saying
poof
it
is
nothing
she
said
no
said
roland
we
easily
them
is
it
you
make
a
will
leaving
your
money
to
the
cause
and
then
where
are
they
it
was
one
way
of
looking
at
it
but
it
brought
little
balm
to
roland
he
said
so
maraquita
scanned
his
face
keenly
you
are
not
weakening
roland
she
said
you
would
not
betray
us
now
well
of
course
i
do
know
about
betraying
you
know
but
still
what
i
mean
is
maraquita
eyes
seemed
to
shoot
forth
two
flames
take
care
she
cried
with
me
it
is
nothing
for
i
know
that
your
heart
is
with
paranoya
but
if
the
others
once
had
cause
to
suspect
that
your
resolve
was
failing
ah
if
bombito
roland
took
her
point
he
had
forgotten
bombito
for
the
moment
for
goodness
sake
he
said
hastily
do
go
saying
anything
to
bombito
to
give
him
the
idea
that
i
trying
to
back
out
of
course
you
can
rely
on
me
and
all
that
that
all
maraquita
gaze
softened
she
raised
her
glass
they
were
lunching
at
the
time
and
put
it
to
her
lips
to
the
savior
of
paranoya
she
said
beware
whispered
a
voice
in
roland
ear
he
turned
with
a
start
a
waiter
was
standing
behind
him
a
small
dark
hairy
man
he
was
looking
into
the
middle
distance
with
the
abstracted
air
which
waiters
cultivate
roland
stared
at
him
but
he
did
not
move
that
evening
returning
to
his
flat
roland
was
paralyzed
by
the
sight
of
the
word
beware
scrawled
across
the
mirror
in
his
bedroom
it
had
apparently
been
done
with
a
diamond
he
rang
the
bell
sir
said
the
competent
valet
competent
valets
are
in
attendance
at
each
of
these
has
any
one
been
here
since
i
left
yes
sir
a
gentleman
called
he
said
he
knew
you
sir
i
showed
him
into
your
the
same
night
well
on
in
the
small
hours
the
telephone
rang
roland
dragged
himself
out
of
bed
hullo
is
that
senor
bleke
yes
what
is
it
beware
things
were
becoming
intolerable
roland
had
a
certain
amount
of
nerve
but
not
enough
to
enable
him
to
bear
up
against
this
sinister
persecution
yet
what
could
he
do
suppose
he
did
beware
to
the
extent
of
withdrawing
his
support
from
the
royalist
movement
what
then
bombito
if
ever
there
was
a
toad
under
the
harrow
he
was
that
toad
and
all
because
a
perfectly
respectful
admiration
for
the
caoutchouc
had
led
him
to
occupy
a
several
nights
in
succession
at
the
theater
where
the
peerless
maraquita
tied
herself
into
knots
there
was
an
air
of
unusual
excitement
in
maraquita
manner
at
their
next
meeting
we
have
been
in
communication
with
him
she
whispered
he
will
receive
you
he
will
give
an
audience
to
the
savior
of
eh
who
will
our
beloved
alejandro
he
wishes
to
see
his
faithful
servant
we
are
to
go
to
him
at
where
at
his
own
house
he
will
receive
you
in
such
was
the
quality
of
the
emotions
through
which
he
had
been
passing
of
late
that
roland
felt
but
a
faint
interest
at
the
prospect
of
meeting
face
to
face
a
genuine
if
exiled
monarch
the
thought
did
flit
through
his
mind
that
they
would
sit
up
a
bit
in
old
fineberg
office
if
they
could
hear
of
it
but
it
brought
him
little
consolation
the
cab
drew
up
at
a
house
in
a
fashionable
square
roland
rang
the
there
seemed
a
certain
element
of
the
prosaic
in
the
action
he
wondered
what
he
should
say
to
the
butler
there
was
however
no
need
for
words
the
door
opened
and
they
were
ushered
in
without
parley
a
butler
and
two
footmen
showed
them
into
a
luxuriously
furnished
anteroom
roland
entered
with
two
thoughts
running
in
his
mind
the
first
was
that
the
beloved
alejandro
had
got
an
uncommonly
snug
crib
the
second
that
this
was
exactly
like
going
to
see
the
dentist
presently
the
squad
of
retainers
returned
the
butler
leading
his
majesty
will
receive
roland
followed
him
with
tottering
knees
his
majesty
king
alejandro
the
thirteenth
on
the
retired
list
was
a
man
of
middle
age
comfortably
stout
about
the
middle
and
a
little
bald
as
to
the
forehead
he
might
have
been
a
prosperous
roland
felt
more
at
his
ease
at
the
very
sight
of
him
sit
down
bleke
said
his
majesty
as
the
door
closed
i
have
been
wanting
to
see
you
for
some
roland
had
nothing
to
say
he
was
regaining
his
composure
but
he
had
a
long
way
to
go
yet
before
he
could
feel
thoroughly
at
home
king
alejandro
produced
a
and
offered
it
to
roland
who
shook
his
head
speechlessly
the
king
lit
a
cigaret
and
smoked
thoughtfully
for
a
while
you
know
bleke
he
said
at
last
this
must
stop
it
really
must
i
mean
your
devoted
efforts
on
my
roland
gaped
at
him
you
are
a
very
young
man
i
had
expected
to
see
some
one
much
older
your
youth
gives
me
the
impression
that
you
have
gone
into
this
affair
from
a
spirit
of
adventure
i
can
assure
you
that
you
have
nothing
to
gain
commercially
by
interfering
with
my
late
kingdom
i
hope
before
we
part
that
i
can
persuade
you
to
abandon
your
idea
of
financing
this
movement
to
restore
me
to
the
throne
i
do
understand
er
your
i
will
explain
please
treat
what
i
shall
say
as
strictly
confidential
you
must
know
bleke
that
these
attempts
to
me
as
a
reigning
monarch
in
paranoya
are
frankly
the
curse
of
an
otherwise
very
pleasant
existence
you
look
surprized
my
dear
sir
do
you
know
paranoya
have
you
ever
been
there
have
you
the
remotest
idea
what
sort
of
life
a
king
of
paranoya
leads
i
have
tried
it
and
i
can
assure
you
that
a
is
happy
by
comparison
in
the
first
place
the
climate
of
the
country
is
abominable
i
always
had
a
cold
in
the
head
secondly
there
is
a
small
but
energetic
section
of
the
populace
whose
sole
recreation
it
seems
to
be
to
use
their
monarch
as
a
target
for
bombs
they
are
not
very
good
bombs
it
is
true
but
one
in
say
ten
explodes
and
even
an
occasional
bomb
is
unpleasant
if
you
are
the
target
finally
i
am
much
too
fond
of
your
delightful
country
to
wish
to
leave
it
i
was
educated
in
england
i
am
a
magdalene
college
man
and
i
have
the
greatest
horror
of
ever
being
compelled
to
leave
it
my
present
life
suits
me
exactly
that
is
all
i
wished
to
say
bleke
for
both
our
sakes
for
the
sake
of
my
comfort
and
your
purse
abandon
this
scheme
of
roland
walked
home
thoughtfully
maraquita
had
left
the
royal
residence
long
before
he
had
finished
the
which
the
genial
monarch
had
pressed
upon
him
as
he
walked
the
futility
of
his
situation
came
home
to
him
more
and
more
whatever
he
did
he
was
bound
to
displease
somebody
and
these
paranoyans
were
so
confoundedly
impulsive
when
they
were
vexed
for
two
days
he
avoided
maraquita
on
the
third
with
something
of
the
instinct
which
draws
the
murderer
to
the
spot
where
he
has
buried
the
body
he
called
at
her
house
she
was
not
present
but
otherwise
there
was
a
full
gathering
there
were
the
marquises
there
were
the
counts
there
was
bombito
he
looked
unhappily
round
the
crowd
somebody
gave
him
a
glass
of
champagne
he
raised
it
to
the
revolution
he
said
mechanically
there
was
a
silence
it
seemed
to
roland
an
awkward
silence
as
if
he
had
said
something
improper
the
marquises
and
counts
began
to
drift
from
the
room
till
only
bombito
was
left
roland
regarded
him
with
some
apprehension
he
was
looking
larger
and
more
unusual
than
ever
but
apparently
bombito
was
in
genial
mood
he
came
forward
and
slapped
roland
on
the
shoulder
and
then
the
remarkable
fact
came
to
light
that
bombito
spoke
english
or
a
sort
of
english
my
old
chap
he
said
i
would
have
a
speech
with
he
slapped
roland
again
on
the
shoulder
the
others
they
say
it
with
senor
bleke
gently
maraquita
say
it
with
senor
bleke
gently
so
i
break
it
with
you
he
dealt
roland
a
third
stupendous
punch
whatever
was
to
be
broken
gently
it
was
plain
to
roland
that
it
was
not
himself
and
suddenly
there
came
to
him
a
sort
of
intuition
that
told
him
that
bombito
was
nervous
after
all
you
have
done
for
us
senor
bleke
we
shall
seem
to
you
ungrateful
bounders
but
what
is
it
yes
no
i
should
wonder
perhaps
the
whole
fact
is
that
there
has
been
political
crisis
in
paranoya
upset
yes
you
follow
no
the
ministry
have
been
what
do
you
say
put
through
it
expelled
broken
up
no
more
ministry
new
ministry
wanted
to
conciliate
royalist
party
that
is
the
cry
so
deputation
of
leading
persons
mighty
good
chaps
prominent
merchants
and
that
sort
of
bounder
call
upon
us
they
offer
me
to
be
president
see
no
yes
that
right
i
am
ambitious
blighter
senor
bleke
what
about
it
no
i
accept
i
am
new
president
of
paranoya
so
no
need
for
your
kind
assistance
royalist
revolution
up
the
spout
no
more
royalist
the
wave
of
relief
which
swept
over
roland
ebbed
sufficiently
after
an
interval
to
enable
him
to
think
of
some
one
but
himself
he
was
not
fond
of
maraquita
but
he
had
a
tender
heart
and
this
he
felt
would
kill
the
poor
girl
but
maraquita
that
all
right
splendid
old
chap
no
need
to
worry
about
maraquita
stout
old
boy
where
the
husband
goes
so
does
the
wife
go
as
you
say
whither
thou
goes
will
i
follow
no
but
i
do
understand
maraquita
is
not
your
wife
why
certainly
good
old
heart
what
else
have
you
been
married
to
her
all
the
time
why
certainly
good
dear
the
room
swam
before
roland
eyes
there
was
no
room
in
his
mind
for
meditations
on
the
perfidy
of
woman
he
groped
forward
and
found
bombito
hand
by
jove
he
said
thickly
as
he
wrung
it
again
and
again
i
knew
you
were
a
good
sort
the
first
time
i
saw
you
have
a
drink
or
something
have
a
cigar
or
something
have
something
anyway
and
sit
down
and
tell
me
all
about
the
episode
of
the
hired
past
final
story
of
the
series
first
published
in
october
what
do
you
mean
you
ca
marry
him
after
all
after
all
what
why
ca
you
marry
him
you
are
perfectly
lord
evenwood
gentle
voice
which
had
in
its
time
lulled
the
house
of
peers
to
slumber
more
often
than
any
voice
ever
heard
in
the
gilded
chamber
had
in
it
a
note
of
unwonted
but
quite
justifiable
irritation
if
there
was
one
thing
more
than
another
that
lord
evenwood
disliked
it
was
any
interference
with
arrangements
already
made
the
man
he
continued
is
not
unsightly
the
man
is
not
conspicuously
vulgar
the
man
does
not
eat
peas
with
his
knife
the
man
pronounces
his
aitches
with
meticulous
care
and
accuracy
the
man
moreover
is
worth
rather
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
million
pounds
i
repeat
you
are
childish
yes
i
know
he
a
very
decent
little
chap
father
said
lady
eva
it
not
that
at
i
should
be
gratified
then
to
hear
what
in
your
opinion
it
well
do
you
think
i
could
be
happy
with
him
lady
kimbuck
gave
tongue
she
was
lord
evenwood
sister
she
spent
a
very
happy
widowhood
interfering
in
the
affairs
of
the
various
branches
of
her
family
we
not
asking
you
to
be
happy
you
have
such
odd
ideas
of
happiness
your
idea
of
happiness
is
to
be
married
to
your
cousin
gerry
whose
only
visible
means
of
support
so
far
as
i
can
gather
is
the
four
hundred
a
year
which
he
draws
as
a
member
for
a
constituency
which
has
every
intention
of
throwing
him
out
at
the
next
lady
eva
blushed
lady
kimbuck
faculty
for
nosing
out
the
secrets
of
her
family
had
made
her
justly
disliked
from
the
hebrides
to
southern
cornwall
young
is
not
to
be
thought
of
said
lord
evenwood
firmly
not
for
an
instant
apart
from
anything
else
his
politics
are
all
wrong
moreover
you
are
engaged
to
this
bleke
it
is
a
sacred
responsibility
not
lightly
to
be
evaded
you
can
not
pledge
your
word
one
day
to
enter
upon
the
most
solemn
contract
known
to
ah
the
civilized
world
and
break
it
the
next
it
is
not
fair
to
the
man
it
is
not
fair
to
me
you
know
that
all
i
live
for
is
to
see
you
comfortably
settled
if
i
could
myself
do
anything
for
you
the
matter
would
be
different
but
these
abominable
and
blowick
especially
blowick
no
no
it
out
of
the
question
you
will
be
very
sorry
if
you
do
anything
foolish
i
can
assure
you
that
roland
blekes
are
not
to
be
found
ah
on
every
bush
men
are
extremely
shy
of
marrying
especially
said
lady
kimbuck
into
a
family
like
ours
what
with
blowick
scandal
and
that
shocking
business
of
your
grandfather
and
the
to
say
nothing
of
your
poor
father
trouble
in
thank
you
sophia
interrupted
lord
evenwood
hurriedly
it
is
unnecessary
to
go
into
all
that
now
suffice
it
that
there
are
adequate
reasons
apart
from
all
moral
obligations
why
eva
should
not
break
her
word
to
lady
kimbuck
encyclopedic
grip
of
the
family
annals
was
a
source
of
the
utmost
discomfort
to
her
relatives
it
was
known
that
more
than
one
firm
of
publishers
had
made
her
tempting
offers
for
her
reminiscences
and
the
family
looked
on
like
nervous
spectators
at
a
battle
while
cupidity
fought
its
ceaseless
fight
with
laziness
for
the
evenwood
family
had
at
various
times
and
in
various
ways
stimulated
the
circulation
of
the
evening
papers
most
of
them
were
living
down
something
and
it
was
lady
kimbuck
habit
when
thwarted
in
her
lightest
whim
to
retire
to
her
boudoir
and
announce
that
she
was
not
to
be
disturbed
as
she
was
at
last
making
a
start
on
her
book
abject
surrender
followed
on
the
instant
at
this
point
in
the
discussion
she
folded
up
her
and
rose
it
is
absolutely
necessary
for
you
my
dear
to
make
a
good
match
or
you
will
all
be
ruined
i
of
course
can
always
support
my
declining
years
with
literary
work
but
lady
eva
groaned
against
this
last
argument
there
was
no
appeal
lady
kimbuck
patted
her
affectionately
on
the
shoulder
there
run
along
now
she
said
i
daresay
you
got
a
headache
or
something
that
made
you
say
a
lot
of
foolish
things
you
did
mean
go
down
to
the
i
expect
bleke
is
waiting
there
to
say
goodnight
to
you
i
am
sure
he
must
be
getting
quite
down
in
the
roland
bleke
was
hoping
against
hope
that
lady
eva
prolonged
absence
might
be
due
to
the
fact
that
she
had
gone
to
bed
with
a
headache
and
that
he
might
escape
the
nightly
interview
which
he
so
dreaded
reviewing
his
career
as
he
sat
there
roland
came
to
the
conclusion
that
women
had
the
knack
of
affecting
him
with
a
form
of
temporary
insanity
they
temporarily
changed
his
whole
nature
they
made
him
feel
for
a
brief
while
that
he
was
a
dashing
young
man
capable
of
the
highest
flights
of
love
it
was
only
later
that
the
reaction
came
and
he
realized
that
he
was
nothing
of
the
sort
at
heart
he
was
afraid
of
women
and
in
the
entire
list
of
the
women
of
whom
he
had
been
afraid
he
could
not
find
one
who
had
terrified
him
so
much
as
lady
eva
blyton
other
women
notably
maraquita
now
happily
helping
to
direct
the
destinies
of
paranoya
had
frightened
him
by
their
individuality
lady
eva
frightened
him
both
by
her
individuality
and
the
atmosphere
of
aristocratic
exclusiveness
which
she
conveyed
he
had
no
idea
whatever
of
what
was
the
proper
procedure
for
a
man
engaged
to
the
daughter
of
an
earl
daughters
of
earls
had
been
to
him
till
now
mere
names
in
the
society
columns
of
the
morning
paper
the
very
rules
of
the
game
were
beyond
him
he
felt
like
a
confirmed
association
footballer
suddenly
called
upon
to
play
in
an
international
rugby
match
all
along
from
the
very
moment
when
to
his
unbounded
astonishment
she
had
accepted
him
he
had
known
that
he
was
making
a
mistake
but
he
never
realized
it
with
such
painful
clearness
as
he
did
this
evening
he
was
filled
with
a
sort
of
blind
terror
he
cursed
the
fate
which
had
taken
him
to
the
at
which
he
had
first
come
under
the
notice
of
lady
kimbuck
the
fatuous
snobbishness
which
had
made
him
leap
at
her
invitation
to
spend
a
few
days
at
evenwood
towers
he
regretted
but
for
that
he
blamed
himself
less
further
acquaintance
with
lady
kimbuck
had
convinced
him
that
if
she
had
wanted
him
she
would
have
got
him
somehow
whether
he
had
accepted
or
refused
what
he
really
blamed
himself
for
was
his
mad
proposal
there
had
been
no
need
for
it
true
lady
eva
had
created
a
riot
of
burning
emotions
in
his
breast
from
the
moment
they
met
but
he
should
have
had
the
sense
to
realize
that
she
was
not
the
right
mate
for
him
even
tho
he
might
have
a
quarter
of
a
million
tucked
away
in
securities
their
lives
could
not
possibly
mix
he
was
a
commonplace
young
man
with
a
fondness
for
the
pleasures
of
the
people
he
liked
cheap
papers
and
association
football
merely
to
think
of
association
football
in
connection
with
her
was
enough
to
make
the
folly
of
his
conduct
clear
he
ought
to
have
been
content
to
worship
her
from
afar
as
some
inaccessible
goddess
a
light
step
outside
the
door
made
his
heart
stop
beating
i
just
looked
in
to
say
good
night
er
roland
she
said
holding
out
her
hand
do
excuse
me
i
got
such
a
oh
yes
rather
i
awfully
if
there
was
one
person
in
the
world
roland
despised
and
hated
at
that
moment
it
was
himself
are
you
going
out
with
the
guns
asked
lady
eva
languidly
oh
yes
rather
i
mean
no
i
afraid
i
do
the
back
of
his
neck
began
to
glow
he
had
no
illusions
about
himself
he
was
the
biggest
ass
in
christendom
perhaps
you
like
to
play
a
round
of
golf
then
oh
yes
rather
i
mean
there
it
was
again
that
awful
phrase
he
was
certain
he
had
not
intended
to
utter
it
she
must
be
thinking
him
a
perfect
lunatic
i
do
play
they
stood
looking
at
each
other
for
a
moment
it
seemed
to
roland
that
her
gaze
was
partly
contemptuous
partly
pitying
he
longed
to
tell
her
that
tho
she
had
happened
to
pick
on
his
weak
points
in
the
realm
of
sport
there
were
things
he
could
do
an
insane
desire
came
upon
him
to
babble
about
his
school
football
team
should
he
ask
her
to
feel
his
quite
respectable
biceps
no
never
mind
she
said
kindly
i
daresay
we
shall
think
of
something
to
amuse
she
held
out
her
hand
again
he
took
it
in
his
for
the
briefest
possible
instant
painfully
conscious
the
while
that
his
own
hand
was
clammy
from
the
emotion
through
which
he
had
been
passing
good
good
thank
heaven
she
was
gone
that
let
him
out
for
another
twelve
hours
at
least
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
found
roland
still
sitting
where
she
had
left
him
his
head
in
his
hands
the
groan
of
an
overwrought
soul
escaped
him
i
ca
do
it
he
sprang
to
his
feet
i
wo
do
a
smooth
voice
from
behind
him
spoke
i
think
you
are
quite
right
sir
if
i
may
make
the
roland
had
hardly
ever
been
so
startled
in
his
life
in
the
first
place
he
was
not
aware
of
having
uttered
his
thoughts
aloud
in
the
second
he
had
imagined
that
he
was
alone
in
the
room
and
so
a
moment
before
he
had
been
but
the
owner
of
the
voice
possessed
among
other
qualities
the
faculty
of
entering
a
room
perfectly
noiselessly
a
fact
which
had
won
for
him
in
the
course
of
a
long
career
in
the
service
of
the
best
families
the
flattering
position
of
star
witness
in
a
number
of
england
raciest
teal
the
butler
for
it
was
no
less
a
celebrity
who
had
broken
in
on
roland
reverie
was
a
long
thin
man
of
a
somewhat
priestly
cast
of
countenance
he
lacked
that
air
of
reproving
hauteur
which
many
butlers
possess
and
it
was
for
this
reason
that
roland
had
felt
drawn
to
him
during
the
black
days
of
his
stay
at
evenwood
towers
teal
had
been
uncommonly
nice
to
him
on
the
whole
he
had
seemed
to
roland
stricken
by
interviews
with
his
host
and
lady
kimbuck
the
only
human
thing
in
the
place
he
liked
teal
on
the
other
hand
teal
was
certainly
taking
a
liberty
he
could
if
he
so
pleased
tell
teal
to
go
to
the
deuce
technically
he
had
the
right
to
freeze
teal
with
a
look
he
did
neither
of
these
things
he
was
feeling
very
lonely
and
very
forlorn
in
a
strange
and
depressing
world
and
teal
voice
and
manner
were
soothing
hearing
you
speak
and
seeing
nobody
else
in
the
room
went
on
the
butler
i
thought
for
a
moment
that
you
were
addressing
this
was
not
true
and
roland
knew
it
was
not
true
instinct
told
him
that
teal
knew
that
he
knew
it
was
not
true
but
he
did
not
press
the
point
what
do
you
mean
you
think
i
am
quite
right
he
said
you
do
know
what
i
was
thinking
teal
smiled
indulgently
on
the
contrary
sir
a
child
could
have
guessed
it
you
have
just
come
to
the
decision
in
my
opinion
a
thoroughly
sensible
one
that
your
engagement
to
her
ladyship
can
not
be
allowed
to
go
on
you
are
quite
right
sir
it
wo
personal
magnetism
covers
a
multitude
of
sins
roland
was
perfectly
well
aware
that
he
ought
not
to
be
standing
here
chatting
over
his
and
lady
eva
intimate
affairs
with
a
butler
but
such
was
teal
magnetism
that
he
was
quite
unable
to
do
the
right
thing
and
tell
him
to
mind
his
own
business
teal
you
forget
yourself
would
have
covered
the
situation
roland
however
was
physically
incapable
of
saying
teal
you
forget
yourself
the
bird
knows
all
the
time
that
he
ought
not
to
stand
talking
to
the
snake
but
he
is
incapable
of
ending
the
conversation
roland
was
conscious
of
a
momentary
wish
that
he
was
the
sort
of
man
who
could
tell
butlers
that
they
forgot
themselves
but
then
that
sort
of
man
would
never
be
in
this
sort
of
trouble
the
teal
you
forget
yourself
type
of
man
would
be
a
shot
a
plus
golfer
and
would
certainly
consider
himself
extremely
lucky
to
be
engaged
to
lady
eva
the
question
is
went
on
teal
how
are
we
to
break
it
off
roland
felt
that
as
he
had
sinned
against
all
the
decencies
in
allowing
the
butler
to
discuss
his
affairs
with
him
he
might
just
as
well
go
the
whole
hog
and
allow
the
discussion
to
run
its
course
and
it
was
an
undeniable
relief
to
talk
about
the
infernal
thing
to
some
one
he
nodded
gloomily
and
committed
himself
teal
resumed
his
remarks
with
the
gusto
of
a
it
not
an
easy
thing
to
do
gracefully
sir
believe
me
it
is
and
it
got
to
be
done
gracefully
or
not
at
all
you
ca
go
to
her
ladyship
and
say
all
off
and
so
am
i
and
catch
the
next
train
for
london
the
rupture
must
be
of
her
ladyship
making
if
some
fact
some
disgraceful
information
concerning
you
were
to
come
to
her
ladyship
ears
that
would
be
a
simple
way
out
of
the
he
eyed
roland
meditatively
if
for
instance
you
had
ever
been
in
jail
sir
well
i
no
offense
intended
sir
i
sure
i
merely
remembered
that
you
had
made
a
great
deal
of
money
very
quickly
my
experience
of
gentlemen
who
have
made
a
great
deal
of
money
very
quickly
is
that
they
have
generally
done
their
bit
of
time
but
of
course
if
you
let
me
think
do
you
drink
sir
teal
sighed
roland
could
not
help
feeling
that
he
was
disappointing
the
old
man
a
good
deal
you
do
not
i
suppose
chance
to
have
a
past
asked
teal
not
very
hopefully
i
use
the
word
in
its
technical
sense
a
deserted
wife
some
poor
creature
you
have
treated
shamefully
at
the
risk
of
sinking
still
further
in
the
butler
esteem
roland
was
compelled
to
answer
in
the
negative
i
was
afraid
not
said
teal
shaking
his
head
thinking
it
all
over
yesterday
i
said
to
myself
afraid
he
would
have
one
you
do
look
like
the
sort
of
gentleman
who
had
done
much
with
his
thinking
it
over
not
on
your
account
sir
explained
teal
on
the
family
i
disapproved
of
this
match
from
the
first
a
man
who
has
served
a
family
as
long
as
i
have
had
the
honor
of
serving
his
lordship
comes
to
entertain
a
high
regard
for
the
family
prestige
and
with
no
offense
to
yourself
sir
this
would
not
have
well
it
looks
as
if
it
would
have
to
do
said
roland
gloomily
i
ca
see
any
way
out
of
i
can
sir
my
niece
at
teal
wagged
his
head
at
him
with
a
kind
of
priestly
archness
you
can
not
have
forgotten
my
niece
at
aldershot
roland
stared
at
him
dumbly
it
was
like
a
line
out
of
a
melodrama
he
feared
first
for
his
own
then
for
the
butler
sanity
the
latter
was
smiling
gently
as
one
who
sees
light
in
a
difficult
situation
i
never
been
at
aldershot
in
my
for
our
purposes
you
have
sir
but
i
afraid
i
am
puzzling
you
let
me
explain
i
got
a
niece
over
at
aldershot
who
is
much
good
she
not
very
particular
i
am
sure
she
would
do
it
for
a
do
what
be
your
sir
i
do
mind
telling
you
that
as
a
had
some
experience
looks
the
part
too
she
a
barmaid
and
you
would
guess
it
the
first
time
you
saw
her
dyed
yellow
hair
sir
he
went
on
with
enthusiasm
done
all
frizzy
just
the
sort
of
young
person
that
a
young
gentleman
like
yourself
would
have
had
a
with
you
find
a
better
if
you
tried
for
a
but
i
say
i
suppose
a
hundred
would
hurt
you
well
no
i
suppose
not
but
then
put
the
whole
thing
in
my
hands
sir
i
ask
leave
off
and
pop
over
and
see
her
i
arrange
for
her
to
come
here
the
day
after
to
see
you
leave
it
all
to
me
you
must
write
the
letters
naturally
there
would
be
letters
sir
it
is
an
inseparable
feature
of
these
do
you
mean
that
i
have
got
to
write
to
her
but
i
should
know
what
to
say
i
never
seen
that
will
be
quite
all
right
sir
if
you
place
yourself
in
my
hands
i
will
come
to
your
room
after
everybody
gone
to
bed
and
help
you
write
those
letters
you
have
some
with
your
own
address
on
it
then
it
will
all
be
perfectly
when
some
hours
later
he
read
over
the
ten
or
twelve
exceedingly
passionate
epistles
which
with
the
butler
assistance
he
had
succeeded
in
writing
to
miss
maud
chilvers
roland
came
to
the
conclusion
that
there
must
have
been
a
time
when
teal
was
a
good
deal
less
respectable
than
he
appeared
to
be
at
present
byronic
was
the
only
adjective
applicable
to
his
collaborator
style
of
amatory
composition
in
every
letter
there
were
passages
against
which
roland
had
felt
compelled
to
make
a
modest
protest
thousand
kisses
on
your
lovely
rosebud
of
a
mouth
do
you
think
that
is
a
little
too
warmly
colored
and
am
languishing
for
the
pressure
of
your
ivory
arms
about
my
neck
and
the
sweep
of
your
silken
hair
against
my
cheek
what
i
mean
is
well
what
about
it
you
know
the
phrases
said
teal
not
without
a
touch
of
displeasure
to
which
you
take
exception
are
taken
bodily
from
correspondence
which
i
happened
to
have
the
advantage
of
perusing
addressed
by
the
late
lord
evenwood
to
animalcula
queen
of
the
high
wire
at
astley
circus
his
lordship
i
may
add
was
considered
an
authority
in
these
roland
criticized
no
more
he
handed
over
the
letters
which
at
teal
direction
he
had
headed
with
various
dates
covering
roughly
a
period
of
about
two
months
antecedent
to
his
arrival
at
the
towers
that
teal
explained
will
make
your
conduct
definitely
unpardonable
with
this
woman
kisses
hot
upon
your
lips
teal
was
still
slightly
aglow
with
the
fire
of
inspiration
you
have
the
effrontery
to
come
here
and
offer
yourself
to
her
with
roland
timid
suggestion
that
it
was
perhaps
a
mistake
to
overdo
the
atmosphere
the
butler
found
himself
unable
to
agree
you
ca
make
yourself
out
too
bad
if
you
do
pitch
it
hot
and
strong
her
ladyship
might
quite
likely
forgive
you
then
where
would
you
be
miss
maud
chilvers
of
aldershot
burst
into
roland
life
like
one
of
the
shells
of
her
native
heath
two
days
later
at
about
five
in
the
afternoon
it
was
an
entrance
of
which
any
might
have
been
proud
of
having
arranged
the
lighting
the
grouping
the
all
were
perfect
the
family
had
just
finished
tea
in
the
long
lady
kimbuck
was
crocheting
lord
evenwood
dozing
lady
eva
reading
and
roland
thinking
a
peaceful
scene
a
soft
rippling
murmur
scarcely
to
be
reckoned
a
snore
had
just
proceeded
from
lord
evenwood
parted
lips
when
the
door
opened
and
teal
announced
miss
roland
stiffened
in
his
chair
now
that
the
ghastly
moment
had
come
he
felt
too
petrified
with
fear
even
to
act
the
little
part
in
which
he
had
been
diligently
rehearsed
by
the
obliging
teal
he
simply
sat
and
did
nothing
it
was
speedily
made
clear
to
him
that
miss
chilvers
would
do
all
the
actual
doing
that
was
necessary
the
butler
had
drawn
no
false
picture
of
her
personal
appearance
dyed
yellow
hair
done
all
frizzy
was
but
one
fact
of
her
impossibilities
in
the
serene
surroundings
of
the
long
she
looked
more
unspeakably
not
much
good
than
roland
had
ever
imagined
her
with
such
a
leading
lady
his
drama
could
not
fail
of
success
he
should
have
been
pleased
he
was
merely
appalled
the
thing
might
have
a
happy
ending
but
while
it
lasted
it
was
going
to
be
terrible
she
had
a
flatteringly
attentive
reception
nobody
failed
to
notice
her
lord
evenwood
woke
with
a
start
and
stared
at
her
as
if
she
had
been
some
ghost
from
his
trouble
of
lady
eva
face
expressed
sheer
amazement
lady
kimbuck
laying
down
her
took
one
look
at
the
apparition
and
instantly
decided
that
one
of
her
numerous
erring
relatives
had
been
at
it
again
of
all
the
persons
in
the
room
she
was
possibly
the
only
one
completely
cheerful
she
was
used
to
these
situations
and
enjoyed
them
her
mind
roaming
into
the
past
recalled
the
night
when
her
cousin
warminster
had
been
pinked
by
a
stiletto
in
his
own
by
a
lady
from
south
america
happy
days
happy
days
lord
evenwood
had
by
this
time
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
festive
blowick
must
be
responsible
for
this
visitation
he
rose
with
dignity
to
what
are
we
he
began
miss
chilvers
resolute
young
woman
had
no
intention
of
standing
there
while
other
people
talked
she
shook
her
gleaming
head
and
burst
into
speech
oh
yes
i
know
i
no
right
to
be
coming
walking
in
here
among
a
lot
of
perfect
strangers
at
their
teas
but
what
i
say
is
right
and
wrong
wrong
all
the
world
over
and
i
may
be
poor
but
i
have
my
feelings
no
thank
you
i
wo
sit
down
i
not
come
for
the
weekend
i
come
to
say
a
few
words
and
when
i
said
them
i
go
and
not
before
a
lady
friend
of
mine
happened
to
be
reading
her
daily
sketch
the
other
day
and
she
said
hullo
and
passed
it
on
to
me
with
her
thumb
on
a
picture
which
had
under
it
that
it
was
lady
eva
blyton
who
was
engaged
to
be
married
to
roland
bleke
and
when
i
read
that
i
said
hullo
too
i
give
you
my
word
and
not
being
able
to
travel
at
once
owing
to
being
prostrated
with
the
shock
i
came
along
just
to
have
a
look
at
roland
blooming
bleke
and
ask
him
if
he
forgotten
that
he
happens
to
be
engaged
to
me
that
all
i
know
it
the
sort
of
thing
that
might
slip
any
gentleman
mind
but
i
thought
it
might
be
worth
mentioning
so
now
roland
perspiring
in
the
shadows
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
felt
that
miss
chilvers
was
overdoing
it
there
was
no
earthly
need
for
all
this
sort
of
thing
just
a
simple
announcement
of
the
engagement
would
have
been
quite
sufficient
it
was
too
obvious
to
him
that
his
ally
was
thoroughly
enjoying
herself
she
had
the
center
of
the
stage
and
did
not
intend
lightly
to
relinquish
it
my
good
girl
said
lady
kimbuck
talk
less
and
prove
more
when
did
bleke
promise
to
marry
you
oh
it
all
right
i
not
expecting
you
to
believe
my
word
i
got
all
the
proofs
you
want
here
his
lady
kimbuck
eyes
gleamed
she
took
the
package
eagerly
she
never
lost
an
opportunity
of
reading
compromising
letters
she
enjoyed
them
as
literature
and
there
was
never
any
knowing
when
they
might
come
in
useful
roland
said
lady
eva
quietly
have
you
anything
to
contribute
to
this
conversation
miss
chilvers
clutched
at
her
bodice
cinema
palaces
were
a
passion
with
her
and
she
was
up
in
the
correct
business
is
he
here
in
this
room
roland
slunk
from
the
shadows
mr
bleke
said
lord
evenwood
sternly
who
is
this
woman
roland
uttered
a
kind
of
strangled
cough
are
these
letters
in
your
handwriting
asked
lady
kimbuck
almost
cordially
she
had
seldom
read
better
compromising
letters
in
her
life
and
she
was
agreeably
surprized
that
one
whom
she
had
always
imagined
a
colorless
stick
should
have
been
capable
of
them
roland
nodded
well
it
lucky
you
rich
said
lady
kimbuck
philosophically
what
are
you
asking
for
these
she
enquired
of
miss
chilvers
exactly
said
lord
evenwood
relieved
precisely
your
sterling
common
sense
is
admirable
sophia
you
place
the
whole
matter
at
once
on
a
businesslike
do
you
imagine
for
a
moment
began
miss
chilvers
slowly
yes
said
lady
kimbuck
how
much
miss
chilvers
sobbed
if
i
have
lost
him
for
ever
lady
eva
rose
but
you
have
she
said
pleasantly
i
would
dream
of
standing
in
your
she
drew
a
ring
from
her
finger
placed
it
on
the
table
and
walked
to
the
door
i
am
not
engaged
to
bleke
she
said
as
she
reached
it
roland
never
knew
quite
how
he
had
got
away
from
the
towers
he
had
confused
memories
in
which
the
principals
of
the
scene
figured
in
various
ways
all
unpleasant
it
was
a
portion
of
his
life
on
which
he
did
not
care
to
dwell
safely
back
in
his
flat
however
he
gradually
recovered
his
normal
spirits
indeed
now
that
the
tumult
and
the
shouting
had
so
to
speak
died
and
he
was
free
to
take
a
broad
view
of
his
position
he
felt
distinctly
happier
than
usual
that
lady
kimbuck
had
passed
for
ever
from
his
life
was
enough
in
itself
to
make
for
gaiety
he
was
humming
blithely
one
morning
as
he
opened
his
letters
outside
the
sky
was
blue
and
the
sun
shining
it
was
good
to
be
alive
he
opened
the
first
letter
the
sky
was
still
blue
the
sun
still
shining
dear

it
ran
we

been
instructed
by
