the
principles
of
scientific
management
by
frederick
winslow
taylor
introduction
president
roosevelt
in
his
address
to
the
governors
at
the
white
house
prophetically
remarked
that
the
conservation
of
our
national
resources
is
only
preliminary
to
the
larger
question
of
national
efficiency
the
whole
country
at
once
recognized
the
importance
of
conserving
our
material
resources
and
a
large
movement
has
been
started
which
will
be
effective
in
accomplishing
this
object
as
yet
however
we
have
but
vaguely
appreciated
the
importance
of
the
larger
question
of
increasing
our
national
efficiency
we
can
see
our
forests
vanishing
our
going
to
waste
our
soil
being
carried
by
floods
into
the
sea
and
the
end
of
our
coal
and
our
iron
is
in
sight
but
our
larger
wastes
of
human
effort
which
go
on
every
day
through
such
of
our
acts
as
are
blundering
or
inefficient
and
which
roosevelt
refers
to
as
a
lack
of
national
efficiency
are
less
visible
less
tangible
and
are
but
vaguely
appreciated
we
can
see
and
feel
the
waste
of
material
things
awkward
inefficient
or
movements
of
men
however
leave
nothing
visible
or
tangible
behind
them
their
appreciation
calls
for
an
act
of
memory
an
effort
of
the
imagination
and
for
this
reason
even
though
our
daily
loss
from
this
source
is
greater
than
from
our
waste
of
material
things
the
one
has
stirred
us
deeply
while
the
other
has
moved
us
but
little
as
yet
there
has
been
no
public
agitation
for
greater
national
efficiency
no
meetings
have
been
called
to
consider
how
this
is
to
be
brought
about
and
still
there
are
signs
that
the
need
for
greater
efficiency
is
widely
felt
the
search
for
better
for
more
competent
men
from
the
presidents
of
our
great
companies
down
to
our
household
servants
was
never
more
vigorous
than
it
is
now
and
more
than
ever
before
is
the
demand
for
competent
men
in
excess
of
the
supply
what
we
are
all
looking
for
however
is
the
readymade
competent
man
the
man
whom
some
one
else
has
trained
it
is
only
when
we
fully
realize
that
our
duty
as
well
as
our
opportunity
lies
in
systematically
cooperating
to
train
and
to
make
this
competent
man
instead
of
in
hunting
for
a
man
whom
some
one
else
has
trained
that
we
shall
be
on
the
road
to
national
efficiency
in
the
past
the
prevailing
idea
has
been
well
expressed
in
the
saying
that
captains
of
industry
are
born
not
made
and
the
theory
has
been
that
if
one
could
get
the
right
man
methods
could
be
safely
left
to
him
in
the
future
it
will
be
appreciated
that
our
leaders
must
be
trained
right
as
well
as
born
right
and
that
no
great
man
can
with
the
old
system
of
personal
management
hope
to
compete
with
a
number
of
ordinary
men
who
have
been
properly
organized
so
as
efficiently
to
cooperate
in
the
past
the
man
has
been
first
in
the
future
the
system
must
be
first
this
in
no
sense
however
implies
that
great
men
are
not
needed
on
the
contrary
the
first
object
of
any
good
system
must
be
that
of
developing
men
and
under
systematic
management
the
best
man
rises
to
the
top
more
certainly
and
more
rapidly
than
ever
before
this
paper
has
been
written
first
to
point
out
through
a
series
of
simple
illustrations
the
great
loss
which
the
whole
country
is
suffering
through
inefficiency
in
almost
all
of
our
daily
acts
second
to
try
to
convince
the
reader
that
the
remedy
for
this
inefficiency
lies
in
systematic
management
rather
than
in
searching
for
some
unusual
or
extraordinary
man
third
to
prove
that
the
best
management
is
a
true
science
resting
upon
clearly
defined
laws
rules
and
principles
as
a
foundation
and
further
to
show
that
the
fundamental
principles
of
scientific
management
are
applicable
to
all
kinds
of
human
activities
from
our
simplest
individual
acts
to
the
work
of
our
great
corporations
which
call
for
the
most
elaborate
cooperation
and
briefly
through
a
series
of
illustrations
to
convince
the
reader
that
whenever
these
principles
are
correctly
applied
results
must
follow
which
are
truly
astounding
this
paper
was
originally
prepared
for
presentation
to
the
american
society
of
mechanical
engineers
the
illustrations
chosen
are
such
as
it
is
believed
will
especially
appeal
to
engineers
and
to
managers
of
industrial
and
manufacturing
establishments
and
also
quite
as
much
to
all
of
the
men
who
are
working
in
these
establishments
it
is
hoped
however
that
it
will
be
clear
to
other
readers
that
the
same
principles
can
be
applied
with
equal
force
to
all
social
activities
to
the
management
of
our
homes
the
management
of
our
farms
the
management
of
the
business
of
our
tradesmen
large
and
small
of
our
churches
our
philanthropic
institutions
our
universities
and
our
governmental
departments
chapter
i
fundamentals
of
scientific
management
the
principal
object
of
management
should
be
to
secure
the
maximum
prosperity
for
the
employer
coupled
with
the
maximum
prosperity
for
each
employee
the
words
maximum
prosperity
are
used
in
their
broad
sense
to
mean
not
only
large
dividends
for
the
company
or
owner
but
the
development
of
every
branch
of
the
business
to
its
highest
state
of
excellence
so
that
the
prosperity
may
be
permanent
in
the
same
way
maximum
prosperity
for
each
employee
means
not
only
higher
wages
than
are
usually
received
by
men
of
his
class
but
of
more
importance
still
it
also
means
the
development
of
each
man
to
his
state
of
maximum
efficiency
so
that
he
may
be
able
to
do
generally
speaking
the
highest
grade
of
work
for
which
his
natural
abilities
fit
him
and
it
further
means
giving
him
when
possible
this
class
of
work
to
do
it
would
seem
to
be
so
that
maximum
prosperity
for
the
employer
coupled
with
maximum
prosperity
for
the
employee
ought
to
be
the
two
leading
objects
of
management
that
even
to
state
this
fact
should
be
unnecessary
and
yet
there
is
no
question
that
throughout
the
industrial
world
a
large
part
of
the
organization
of
employers
as
well
as
employees
is
for
war
rather
than
for
peace
and
that
perhaps
the
majority
on
either
side
do
not
believe
that
it
is
possible
so
to
arrange
their
mutual
relations
that
their
interests
become
identical
the
majority
of
these
men
believe
that
the
fundamental
interests
of
employees
and
employers
are
necessarily
antagonistic
scientific
management
on
the
contrary
has
for
its
very
foundation
the
firm
conviction
that
the
true
interests
of
the
two
are
one
and
the
same
that
prosperity
for
the
employer
can
not
exist
through
a
long
term
of
years
unless
it
is
accompanied
by
prosperity
for
the
employee
and
vice
versa
and
that
it
is
possible
to
give
the
workman
what
he
most
wants
high
wages
and
the
employer
what
he
wants
a
low
labor
cost
for
his
manufactures
it
is
hoped
that
some
at
least
of
those
who
do
not
sympathize
with
each
of
these
objects
may
be
led
to
modify
their
views
that
some
employers
whose
attitude
toward
their
workmen
has
been
that
of
trying
to
get
the
largest
amount
of
work
out
of
them
for
the
smallest
possible
wages
may
be
led
to
see
that
a
more
liberal
policy
toward
their
men
will
pay
them
better
and
that
some
of
those
workmen
who
begrudge
a
fair
and
even
a
large
profit
to
their
employers
and
who
feel
that
all
of
the
fruits
of
their
labor
should
belong
to
them
and
that
those
for
whom
they
work
and
the
capital
invested
in
the
business
are
entitled
to
little
or
nothing
may
be
led
to
modify
these
views
no
one
can
be
found
who
will
deny
that
in
the
case
of
any
single
individual
the
greatest
prosperity
can
exist
only
when
that
individual
has
reached
his
highest
state
of
efficiency
that
is
when
he
is
turning
out
his
largest
daily
output
the
truth
of
this
fact
is
also
perfectly
clear
in
the
case
of
two
men
working
together
to
illustrate
if
you
and
your
workman
have
become
so
skilful
that
you
and
he
together
are
making
two
pairs
of
shoes
in
a
day
while
your
competitor
and
his
workman
are
making
only
one
pair
it
is
clear
that
after
selling
your
two
pairs
of
shoes
you
can
pay
your
workman
much
higher
wages
than
your
competitor
who
produces
only
one
pair
of
shoes
is
able
to
pay
his
man
and
that
there
will
still
be
enough
money
left
over
for
you
to
have
a
larger
profit
than
your
competitor
in
the
case
of
a
more
complicated
manufacturing
establishment
it
should
also
be
perfectly
clear
that
the
greatest
permanent
prosperity
for
the
workman
coupled
with
the
greatest
prosperity
for
the
employer
can
be
brought
about
only
when
the
work
of
the
establishment
is
done
with
the
smallest
combined
expenditure
of
human
effort
plus
nature
resources
plus
the
cost
for
the
use
of
capital
in
the
shape
of
machines
buildings
etc
or
to
state
the
same
thing
in
a
different
way
that
the
greatest
prosperity
can
exist
only
as
the
result
of
the
greatest
possible
productivity
of
the
men
and
machines
of
the
establishment
that
is
when
each
man
and
each
machine
are
turning
out
the
largest
possible
output
because
unless
your
men
and
your
machines
are
daily
turning
out
more
work
than
others
around
you
it
is
clear
that
competition
will
prevent
your
paying
higher
wages
to
your
workmen
than
are
paid
to
those
of
your
competitor
and
what
is
true
as
to
the
possibility
of
paying
high
wages
in
the
case
of
two
companies
competing
close
beside
one
another
is
also
true
as
to
whole
districts
of
the
country
and
even
as
to
nations
which
are
in
competition
in
a
word
that
maximum
prosperity
can
exist
only
as
the
result
of
maximum
productivity
later
in
this
paper
illustrations
will
be
given
of
several
companies
which
are
earning
large
dividends
and
at
the
same
time
paying
from
per
cent
to
per
cent
higher
wages
to
their
men
than
are
paid
to
similar
men
immediately
around
them
and
with
whose
employers
they
are
in
competition
these
illustrations
will
cover
different
types
of
work
from
the
most
elementary
to
the
most
complicated
if
the
above
reasoning
is
correct
it
follows
that
the
most
important
object
of
both
the
workmen
and
the
management
should
be
the
training
and
development
of
each
individual
in
the
establishment
so
that
he
can
do
at
his
fastest
pace
and
with
the
maximum
of
efficiency
the
highest
class
of
work
for
which
his
natural
abilities
fit
him
these
principles
appear
to
be
so
that
many
men
may
think
it
almost
childish
to
state
them
let
us
however
turn
to
the
facts
as
they
actually
exist
in
this
country
and
in
england
the
english
and
american
peoples
are
the
greatest
sportsmen
in
the
world
whenever
an
american
workman
plays
baseball
or
an
english
workman
plays
cricket
it
is
safe
to
say
that
he
strains
every
nerve
to
secure
victory
for
his
side
he
does
his
very
best
to
make
the
largest
possible
number
of
runs
the
universal
sentiment
is
so
strong
that
any
man
who
fails
to
give
out
all
there
is
in
him
in
sport
is
branded
as
a
quitter
and
treated
with
contempt
by
those
who
are
around
him
when
the
same
workman
returns
to
work
on
the
following
day
instead
of
using
every
effort
to
turn
out
the
largest
possible
amount
of
work
in
a
majority
of
the
cases
this
man
deliberately
plans
to
do
as
little
as
he
safely
can
to
turn
out
far
less
work
than
he
is
well
able
to
do
in
many
instances
to
do
not
more
than
to
of
a
proper
work
and
in
fact
if
he
were
to
do
his
best
to
turn
out
his
largest
possible
day
work
he
would
be
abused
by
his
for
so
doing
even
more
than
if
he
had
proved
himself
a
quitter
in
sport
under
working
that
is
deliberately
working
slowly
so
as
to
avoid
doing
a
full
day
work
soldiering
as
it
is
called
in
this
country
hanging
it
out
as
it
is
called
in
england
ca
canae
as
it
is
called
in
scotland
is
almost
universal
in
industrial
establishments
and
prevails
also
to
a
large
extent
in
the
building
trades
and
the
writer
asserts
without
fear
of
contradiction
that
this
constitutes
the
greatest
evil
with
which
the
of
both
england
and
america
are
now
afflicted
it
will
be
shown
later
in
this
paper
that
doing
away
with
slow
working
and
soldiering
in
all
its
forms
and
so
arranging
the
relations
between
employer
and
employs
that
each
workman
will
work
to
his
very
best
advantage
and
at
his
best
speed
accompanied
by
the
intimate
cooperation
with
the
management
and
the
help
which
the
workman
should
receive
from
the
management
would
result
on
the
average
in
nearly
doubling
the
output
of
each
man
and
each
machine
what
other
reforms
among
those
which
are
being
discussed
by
these
two
nations
could
do
as
much
toward
promoting
prosperity
toward
the
diminution
of
poverty
and
the
alleviation
of
suffering
america
and
england
have
been
recently
agitated
over
such
subjects
as
the
tariff
the
control
of
the
large
corporations
on
the
one
hand
and
of
hereditary
power
on
the
other
hand
and
over
various
more
or
less
socialistic
proposals
for
taxation
etc
on
these
subjects
both
peoples
have
been
profoundly
stirred
and
yet
hardly
a
voice
has
been
raised
to
call
attention
to
this
vastly
greater
and
more
important
subject
of
soldiering
which
directly
and
powerfully
affects
the
wages
the
prosperity
and
the
life
of
almost
every
and
also
quite
as
much
the
prosperity
of
every
industrial
establishment
in
the
nation
the
elimination
of
soldiering
and
of
the
several
causes
of
slow
working
would
so
lower
the
cost
of
production
that
both
our
home
and
foreign
markets
would
be
greatly
enlarged
and
we
could
compete
on
more
than
even
terms
with
our
rivals
it
would
remove
one
of
the
fundamental
causes
for
dull
times
for
lack
of
employment
and
for
poverty
and
therefore
would
have
a
more
permanent
and
effect
upon
these
misfortunes
than
any
of
the
curative
remedies
that
are
now
being
used
to
soften
their
consequences
it
would
insure
higher
wages
and
make
shorter
working
hours
and
better
working
and
home
conditions
possible
why
is
it
then
in
the
face
of
the
fact
that
maximum
prosperity
can
exist
only
as
the
result
of
the
determined
effort
of
each
workman
to
turn
out
each
day
his
largest
possible
day
work
that
the
great
majority
of
our
men
are
deliberately
doing
just
the
opposite
and
that
even
when
the
men
have
the
best
of
intentions
their
work
is
in
most
cases
far
from
efficient
there
are
three
causes
for
this
condition
which
may
be
briefly
summarized
as
first
the
fallacy
which
has
from
time
immemorial
been
almost
universal
among
workmen
that
a
material
increase
in
the
output
of
each
man
or
each
machine
in
the
trade
would
result
in
the
end
in
throwing
a
large
number
of
men
out
of
work
second
the
defective
systems
of
management
which
are
in
common
use
and
which
make
it
necessary
for
each
workman
to
soldier
or
work
slowly
in
order
that
he
may
protect
his
own
best
interests
third
the
inefficient
methods
which
are
still
almost
universal
in
all
trades
and
in
practicing
which
our
workmen
waste
a
large
part
of
their
effort
this
paper
will
attempt
to
show
the
enormous
gains
which
would
result
from
the
substitution
by
our
workmen
of
scientific
for
methods
to
explain
a
little
more
fully
these
three
causes
first
the
great
majority
of
workmen
still
believe
that
if
they
were
to
work
at
their
best
speed
they
would
be
doing
a
great
injustice
to
the
whole
trade
by
throwing
a
lot
of
men
out
of
work
and
yet
the
history
of
the
development
of
each
trade
shows
that
each
improvement
whether
it
be
the
invention
of
a
new
machine
or
the
introduction
of
a
better
method
which
results
in
increasing
the
productive
capacity
of
the
men
in
the
trade
and
cheapening
the
costs
instead
of
throwing
men
out
of
work
make
in
the
end
work
for
more
men
the
cheapening
of
any
article
in
common
use
almost
immediately
results
in
a
largely
increased
demand
for
that

take
the
case
of
shoes
for
instance
the
introduction
of
machinery
for
doing
every
element
of
the
work
which
was
formerly
done
by
hand
has
resulted
in
making
shoes
at
a
fraction
of
their
former
labor
cost
and
in
selling
them
so
cheap
that
now
almost
every
man
woman
and
child
in
the
buys
one
or
two
pairs
of
shoes
per
year
and
wears
shoes
all
the
time
whereas
formerly
each
workman
bought
perhaps
one
pair
of
shoes
every
five
years
and
went
barefoot
most
of
the
time
wearing
shoes
only
as
a
luxury
or
as
a
matter
of
the
sternest
necessity
in
spite
of
the
enormously
increased
output
of
shoes
per
workman
which
has
come
with
shoe
machinery
the
demand
for
shoes
has
so
increased
that
there
are
relatively
more
men
working
in
the
shoe
industry
now
than
ever
before
the
workmen
in
almost
every
trade
have
before
them
an
object
lesson
of
this
kind
and
yet
because
they
are
ignorant
of
the
history
of
their
own
trade
even
they
still
firmly
believe
as
their
fathers
did
before
them
that
it
is
against
their
best
interests
for
each
man
to
turn
out
each
day
as
much
work
as
possible
under
this
fallacious
idea
a
large
proportion
of
the
workmen
of
both
countries
each
day
deliberately
work
slowly
so
as
to
curtail
the
output
almost
every
labor
union
has
made
or
is
contemplating
making
rules
which
have
for
their
object
curtailing
the
output
of
their
members
and
those
men
who
have
the
greatest
influence
with
the
the
labor
leaders
as
well
as
many
people
with
philanthropic
feelings
who
are
helping
them
are
daily
spreading
this
fallacy
and
at
the
same
time
telling
them
that
they
are
overworked
a
great
deal
has
been
and
is
being
constantly
said
about
work
and
conditions
the
writer
has
great
sympathy
with
those
who
are
overworked
but
on
the
whole
a
greater
sympathy
for
those
who
are
under
paid
for
every
individual
however
who
is
overworked
there
are
a
hundred
who
intentionally
under
work
greatly
under
work
every
day
of
their
lives
and
who
for
this
reason
deliberately
aid
in
establishing
those
conditions
which
in
the
end
inevitably
result
in
low
wages
and
yet
hardly
a
single
voice
is
being
raised
in
an
endeavor
to
correct
this
evil
as
engineers
and
managers
we
are
more
intimately
acquainted
with
these
facts
than
any
other
class
in
the
community
and
are
therefore
best
fitted
to
lead
in
a
movement
to
combat
this
fallacious
idea
by
educating
not
only
the
workmen
but
the
whole
of
the
country
as
to
the
true
facts
and
yet
we
are
practically
doing
nothing
in
this
direction
and
are
leaving
this
field
entirely
in
the
hands
of
the
labor
agitators
many
of
whom
are
misinformed
and
misguided
and
of
sentimentalists
who
are
ignorant
as
to
actual
working
conditions
second
as
to
the
second
cause
for
soldiering
the
relations
which
exist
between
employers
and
employees
under
almost
all
of
the
systems
of
management
which
are
in
common
use
it
is
impossible
in
a
few
words
to
make
it
clear
to
one
not
familiar
with
this
problem
why
it
is
that
the
ignorance
of
employers
as
to
the
proper
time
in
which
work
of
various
kinds
should
be
done
makes
it
for
the
interest
of
the
workman
to
soldier
the
writer
therefore
quotes
herewith
from
a
paper
read
before
the
american
society
of
mechanical
engineers
in
june
entitled
shop
management
which
it
is
hoped
will
explain
fully
this
cause
for
soldiering
this
loafing
or
soldiering
proceeds
from
two
causes
first
from
the
natural
instinct
and
tendency
of
men
to
take
it
easy
which
may
be
called
natural
soldiering
second
from
more
intricate
second
thought
and
reasoning
caused
by
their
relations
with
other
men
which
may
be
called
systematic
soldiering
there
is
no
question
that
the
tendency
of
the
average
man
in
all
walks
of
life
is
toward
working
at
a
slow
easy
gait
and
that
it
is
only
after
a
good
deal
of
thought
and
observation
on
his
part
or
as
a
result
of
example
conscience
or
external
pressure
that
he
takes
a
more
rapid
pace
there
are
of
course
men
of
unusual
energy
vitality
and
ambition
who
naturally
choose
the
fastest
gait
who
set
up
their
own
standards
and
who
work
hard
even
though
it
may
be
against
their
best
interests
but
these
few
uncommon
men
only
serve
by
forming
a
contrast
to
emphasize
the
tendency
of
the
average
this
common
tendency
to
it
easy
is
greatly
increased
by
bringing
a
number
of
men
together
on
similar
work
and
at
a
uniform
standard
rate
of
pay
by
the
day
under
this
plan
the
better
men
gradually
but
surely
slow
down
their
gait
to
that
of
the
poorest
and
least
efficient
when
a
naturally
energetic
man
works
for
a
few
days
beside
a
lazy
one
the
logic
of
the
situation
is
unanswerable
why
should
i
work
hard
when
that
lazy
fellow
gets
the
same
pay
that
i
do
and
does
only
half
as
much
work
a
careful
time
study
of
men
working
under
these
conditions
will
disclose
facts
which
are
ludicrous
as
well
as
pitiable
to
illustrate
the
writer
has
timed
a
naturally
energetic
workman
who
while
going
and
coming
from
work
would
walk
at
a
speed
of
from
three
to
four
miles
per
hour
and
not
infrequently
trot
home
after
a
day
work
on
arriving
at
his
work
he
would
immediately
slow
down
to
a
speed
of
about
one
mile
an
hour
when
for
example
wheeling
a
loaded
wheelbarrow
he
would
go
at
a
good
fast
pace
even
up
hill
in
order
to
be
as
short
a
time
as
possible
under
load
and
immediately
on
the
return
walk
slow
down
to
a
mile
an
hour
improving
every
opportunity
for
delay
short
of
actually
sitting
down
in
order
to
be
sure
not
to
do
more
than
his
lazy
neighbor
he
would
actually
tire
himself
in
his
effort
to
go
slow
these
men
were
working
under
a
foreman
of
good
reputation
and
highly
thought
of
by
his
employer
who
when
his
attention
was
called
to
this
state
of
things
answered
i
can
keep
them
from
sitting
down
but
the
devil
ca
make
them
get
a
move
on
while
they
are
at
work
the
natural
laziness
of
men
is
serious
but
by
far
the
greatest
evil
from
which
both
workmen
and
employers
are
suffering
is
the
systematic
soldiering
which
is
almost
universal
under
all
of
the
ordinary
schemes
of
management
and
which
results
from
a
careful
study
on
the
part
of
the
workmen
of
what
will
promote
their
best
interests
the
writer
was
much
interested
recently
in
hearing
one
small
but
experienced
golf
caddy
boy
of
twelve
explaining
to
a
green
caddy
who
had
shown
special
energy
and
interest
the
necessity
of
going
slow
and
lagging
behind
his
man
when
he
came
up
to
the
ball
showing
him
that
since
they
were
paid
by
the
hour
the
faster
they
went
the
less
money
they
got
and
finally
telling
him
that
if
he
went
too
fast
the
other
boys
would
give
him
a
licking
this
represents
a
type
of
systematic
soldiering
which
is
not
however
very
serious
since
it
is
done
with
the
knowledge
of
the
employer
who
can
quite
easily
break
it
up
if
he
wishes
the
greater
part
of
the
systematic
soldiering
however
is
done
by
the
men
with
the
deliberate
object
of
keeping
their
employers
ignorant
of
how
fast
work
can
be
done
so
universal
is
soldiering
for
this
purpose
that
hardly
a
competent
workman
can
be
found
in
a
large
establishment
whether
he
works
by
the
day
or
on
piece
work
contract
work
or
under
any
of
the
ordinary
systems
who
does
not
devote
a
considerable
part
of
his
time
to
studying
just
how
slow
he
can
work
and
still
convince
his
employer
that
he
is
going
at
a
good
pace
the
causes
for
this
are
briefly
that
practically
all
employers
determine
upon
a
maximum
sum
which
they
feel
it
is
right
for
each
of
their
classes
of
employees
to
earn
per
day
whether
their
men
work
by
the
day
or
piece
each
workman
soon
finds
out
about
what
this
figure
is
for
his
particular
case
and
he
also
realizes
that
when
his
employer
is
convinced
that
a
man
is
capable
of
doing
more
work
than
he
has
done
he
will
find
sooner
or
later
some
way
of
compelling
him
to
do
it
with
little
or
no
increase
of
pay
employers
derive
their
knowledge
of
how
much
of
a
given
class
of
work
can
be
done
in
a
day
from
either
their
own
experience
which
has
frequently
grown
hazy
with
age
from
casual
and
unsystematic
observation
of
their
men
or
at
best
from
records
which
are
kept
showing
the
quickest
time
in
which
each
job
has
been
done
in
many
cases
the
employer
will
feel
almost
certain
that
a
given
job
can
be
done
faster
than
it
has
been
but
he
rarely
cares
to
take
the
drastic
measures
necessary
to
force
men
to
do
it
in
the
quickest
time
unless
he
has
an
actual
record
proving
conclusively
how
fast
the
work
can
be
done
it
evidently
becomes
for
each
man
interest
then
to
see
that
no
job
is
done
faster
than
it
has
been
in
the
past
the
younger
and
less
experienced
men
are
taught
this
by
their
elders
and
all
possible
persuasion
and
social
pressure
is
brought
to
bear
upon
the
greedy
and
selfish
men
to
keep
them
from
making
new
records
which
result
in
temporarily
increasing
their
wages
while
all
those
who
come
after
them
are
made
to
work
harder
for
the
same
old
pay
under
the
best
day
work
of
the
ordinary
type
when
accurate
records
are
kept
of
the
amount
of
work
done
by
each
man
and
of
his
efficiency
and
when
each
man
wages
are
raised
as
he
improves
and
those
who
fail
to
rise
to
a
certain
standard
are
discharged
and
a
fresh
supply
of
carefully
selected
men
are
given
work
in
their
places
both
the
natural
loafing
and
systematic
soldiering
can
be
largely
broken
up
this
can
only
be
done
however
when
the
men
are
thoroughly
convinced
that
there
is
no
intention
of
establishing
piece
work
even
in
the
remote
future
and
it
is
next
to
impossible
to
make
men
believe
this
when
the
work
is
of
such
a
nature
that
they
believe
piece
work
to
be
practicable
in
most
cases
their
fear
of
making
a
record
which
will
be
used
as
a
basis
for
piece
work
will
cause
them
to
soldier
as
much
as
they
dare
it
is
however
under
piece
work
that
the
art
of
systematic
soldiering
is
thoroughly
developed
after
a
workman
has
had
the
price
per
piece
of
the
work
he
is
doing
lowered
two
or
three
times
as
a
result
of
his
having
worked
harder
and
increased
his
output
he
is
likely
entirely
to
lose
sight
of
his
employer
side
of
the
case
and
become
imbued
with
a
grim
determination
to
have
no
more
cuts
if
soldiering
can
prevent
it
unfortunately
for
the
character
of
the
workman
soldiering
involves
a
deliberate
attempt
to
mislead
and
deceive
his
employer
and
thus
upright
and
straightforward
workmen
are
compelled
to
become
more
or
less
hypocritical
the
employer
is
soon
looked
upon
as
an
antagonist
if
not
an
enemy
and
the
mutual
confidence
which
should
exist
between
a
leader
and
his
men
the
enthusiasm
the
feeling
that
they
are
all
working
for
the
same
end
and
will
share
in
the
results
is
entirely
lacking
the
feeling
of
antagonism
under
the
ordinary
system
becomes
in
many
cases
so
marked
on
the
part
of
the
men
that
any
proposition
made
by
their
employers
however
reasonable
is
looked
upon
with
suspicion
and
soldiering
becomes
such
a
fixed
habit
that
men
will
frequently
take
pains
to
restrict
the
product
of
machines
which
they
are
running
when
even
a
large
increase
in
output
would
involve
no
more
work
on
their
part
third
as
to
the
third
cause
for
slow
work
considerable
space
will
later
in
this
paper
be
devoted
to
illustrating
the
great
gain
both
to
employers
and
employees
which
results
from
the
substitution
of
scientific
for
methods
in
even
the
smallest
details
of
the
work
of
every
trade
the
enormous
saving
of
time
and
therefore
increase
in
the
output
which
it
is
possible
to
effect
through
eliminating
unnecessary
motions
and
substituting
fast
for
slow
and
inefficient
motions
for
the
men
working
in
any
of
our
trades
can
be
fully
realized
only
after
one
has
personally
seen
the
improvement
which
results
from
a
thorough
motion
and
time
study
made
by
a
competent
man
to
explain
briefly
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
workmen
in
all
of
our
trades
have
been
taught
the
details
of
their
work
by
observation
of
those
immediately
around
them
there
are
many
different
ways
in
common
use
for
doing
the
same
thing
perhaps
forty
fifty
or
a
hundred
ways
of
doing
each
act
in
each
trade
and
for
the
same
reason
there
is
a
great
variety
in
the
implements
used
for
each
class
of
work
now
among
the
various
methods
and
implements
used
in
each
element
of
each
trade
there
is
always
one
method
and
one
implement
which
is
quicker
and
better
than
any
of
the
rest
and
this
one
best
method
and
best
implement
can
only
be
discovered
or
developed
through
a
scientific
study
and
analysis
of
all
of
the
methods
and
implements
in
use
together
with
accurate
minute
motion
and
time
study
this
involves
the
gradual
substitution
of
science
for
rule
of
thumb
throughout
the
mechanic
arts
this
paper
will
show
that
the
underlying
philosophy
of
all
of
the
old
systems
of
management
in
common
use
makes
it
imperative
that
each
workman
shall
be
left
with
the
final
responsibility
for
doing
his
job
practically
as
he
thinks
best
with
comparatively
little
help
and
advice
from
the
management
and
it
will
also
show
that
because
of
this
isolation
of
workmen
it
is
in
most
cases
impossible
for
the
men
working
under
these
systems
to
do
their
work
in
accordance
with
the
rules
and
laws
of
a
science
or
art
even
where
one
exists
the
writer
asserts
as
a
general
principle
and
he
proposes
to
give
illustrations
tending
to
prove
the
fact
later
in
this
paper
that
in
almost
all
of
the
mechanic
arts
the
science
which
underlies
each
act
of
each
workman
is
so
great
and
amounts
to
so
much
that
the
workman
who
is
best
suited
to
actually
doing
the
work
is
incapable
of
fully
understanding
this
science
without
the
guidance
and
help
of
those
who
are
working
with
him
or
over
him
either
through
lack
of
education
or
through
insufficient
mental
capacity
in
order
that
the
work
may
be
done
in
accordance
with
scientific
laws
it
is
necessary
that
there
shall
be
a
far
more
equal
division
of
the
responsibility
between
the
management
and
the
workmen
than
exists
under
any
of
the
ordinary
types
of
management
those
in
the
management
whose
duty
it
is
to
develop
this
science
should
also
guide
and
help
the
workman
in
working
under
it
and
should
assume
a
much
larger
share
of
the
responsibility
for
results
than
under
usual
conditions
is
assumed
by
the
management
the
body
of
this
paper
will
make
it
clear
that
to
work
according
to
scientific
laws
the
management
must
take
over
and
perform
much
of
the
work
which
is
now
left
to
the
men
almost
every
act
of
the
workman
should
be
preceded
by
one
or
more
preparatory
acts
of
the
management
which
enable
him
to
do
his
work
better
and
quicker
than
he
otherwise
could
and
each
man
should
daily
be
taught
by
and
receive
the
most
friendly
help
from
those
who
are
over
him
instead
of
being
at
the
one
extreme
driven
or
coerced
by
his
bosses
and
at
the
other
left
to
his
own
unaided
devices
this
close
intimate
personal
cooperation
between
the
management
and
the
men
is
of
the
essence
of
modern
scientific
or
task
management
it
will
be
shown
by
a
series
of
practical
illustrations
that
through
this
friendly
cooperation
namely
through
sharing
equally
in
every
day
burden
all
of
the
great
obstacles
above
described
to
obtaining
the
maximum
output
for
each
man
and
each
machine
in
the
establishment
are
swept
away
the
per
cent
to
per
cent
increase
in
wages
which
the
workmen
are
able
to
earn
beyond
what
they
receive
under
the
old
type
of
management
coupled
with
the
daily
intimate
shoulder
to
shoulder
contact
with
the
management
entirely
removes
all
cause
for
soldiering
and
in
a
few
years
under
this
system
the
workmen
have
before
them
the
object
lesson
of
seeing
that
a
great
increase
in
the
output
per
man
results
in
giving
employment
to
more
men
instead
of
throwing
men
out
of
work
thus
completely
eradicating
the
fallacy
that
a
larger
output
for
each
man
will
throw
other
men
out
of
work
it
is
the
writer
judgment
then
that
while
much
can
be
done
and
should
be
done
by
writing
and
talking
toward
educating
not
only
workmen
but
all
classes
in
the
community
as
to
the
importance
of
obtaining
the
maximum
output
of
each
man
and
each
machine
it
is
only
through
the
adoption
of
modern
scientific
management
that
this
great
problem
can
be
finally
solved
probably
most
of
the
readers
of
this
paper
will
say
that
all
of
this
is
mere
theory
on
the
contrary
the
theory
or
philosophy
of
scientific
management
is
just
beginning
to
be
understood
whereas
the
management
itself
has
been
a
gradual
evolution
extending
over
a
period
of
nearly
thirty
years
and
during
this
time
the
employees
of
one
company
after
another
including
a
large
range
and
diversity
of
industries
have
gradually
changed
from
the
ordinary
to
the
scientific
type
of
management
at
least
workmen
in
the
united
states
are
now
employed
under
this
system
and
they
are
receiving
from
per
cent
to
per
cent
higher
wages
daily
than
are
paid
to
men
of
similar
caliber
with
whom
they
are
surrounded
while
the
companies
employing
them
are
more
prosperous
than
ever
before
in
these
companies
the
output
per
man
and
per
machine
has
on
an
average
been
doubled
during
all
these
years
there
has
never
been
a
single
strike
among
the
men
working
under
this
system
in
place
of
the
suspicious
watchfulness
and
the
more
or
less
open
warfare
which
characterizes
the
ordinary
types
of
management
there
is
universally
friendly
cooperation
between
the
management
and
the
men
several
papers
have
been
written
describing
the
expedients
which
have
been
adopted
and
the
details
which
have
been
developed
under
scientific
management
and
the
steps
to
be
taken
in
changing
from
the
ordinary
to
the
scientific
type
but
unfortunately
most
of
the
readers
of
these
papers
have
mistaken
the
mechanism
for
the
true
essence
scientific
management
fundamentally
consists
of
certain
broad
general
principles
a
certain
philosophy
which
can
be
applied
in
many
ways
and
a
description
of
what
any
one
man
or
men
may
believe
to
be
the
best
mechanism
for
applying
these
general
principles
should
in
no
way
be
confused
with
the
principles
themselves
it
is
not
here
claimed
that
any
single
panacea
exists
for
all
of
the
troubles
of
the
or
of
employers
as
long
as
some
people
are
born
lazy
or
inefficient
and
others
are
born
greedy
and
brutal
as
long
as
vice
and
crime
are
with
us
just
so
long
will
a
certain
amount
of
poverty
misery
and
unhappiness
be
with
us
also
no
system
of
management
no
single
expedient
within
the
control
of
any
man
or
any
set
of
men
can
insure
continuous
prosperity
to
either
workmen
or
employers
prosperity
depends
upon
so
many
factors
entirely
beyond
the
control
of
any
one
set
of
men
any
state
or
even
any
one
country
that
certain
periods
will
inevitably
come
when
both
sides
must
suffer
more
or
less
it
is
claimed
however
that
under
scientific
management
the
intermediate
periods
will
be
far
more
prosperous
far
happier
and
more
free
from
discord
and
dissension
and
also
that
the
periods
will
be
fewer
shorter
and
the
suffering
less
and
this
will
be
particularly
true
in
any
one
town
any
one
section
of
the
country
or
any
one
state
which
first
substitutes
the
principles
of
scientific
management
for
the
rule
of
thumb
that
these
principles
are
certain
to
come
into
general
use
practically
throughout
the
civilized
world
sooner
or
later
the
writer
is
profoundly
convinced
and
the
sooner
they
come
the
better
for
all
the
people
chapter
ii
the
principles
of
scientific
management
the
writer
has
found
that
there
are
three
questions
uppermost
in
the
minds
of
men
when
they
become
interested
in
scientific
management
first
wherein
do
the
principles
of
scientific
management
differ
essentially
from
those
of
ordinary
management
second
why
are
better
results
attained
under
scientific
management
than
under
the
other
types
third
is
not
the
most
important
problem
that
of
getting
the
right
man
at
the
head
of
the
company
and
if
you
have
the
right
man
can
not
the
choice
of
the
type
of
management
be
safely
left
to
him
one
of
the
principal
objects
of
the
following
pages
will
be
to
give
a
satisfactory
answer
to
these
questions
the
finest
type
of
ordinary
management
before
starting
to
illustrate
the
principles
of
scientific
management
or
task
management
as
it
is
briefly
called
it
seems
desirable
to
outline
what
the
writer
believes
will
be
recognized
as
the
best
type
of
management
which
is
in
common
use
this
is
done
so
that
the
great
difference
between
the
best
of
the
ordinary
management
and
scientific
management
may
be
fully
appreciated
in
an
industrial
establishment
which
employs
say
from
to
workmen
there
will
be
found
in
many
cases
at
least
twenty
to
thirty
different
trades
the
workmen
in
each
of
these
trades
have
had
their
knowledge
handed
down
to
them
by
word
of
mouth
through
the
many
years
in
which
their
trade
has
been
developed
from
the
primitive
condition
in
which
our
ancestors
each
one
practiced
the
rudiments
of
many
different
trades
to
the
present
state
of
great
and
growing
subdivision
of
labor
in
which
each
man
specializes
upon
some
comparatively
small
class
of
work
the
ingenuity
of
each
generation
has
developed
quicker
and
better
methods
for
doing
every
element
of
the
work
in
every
trade
thus
the
methods
which
are
now
in
use
may
in
a
broad
sense
be
said
to
be
an
evolution
representing
the
survival
of
the
fittest
and
best
of
the
ideas
which
have
been
developed
since
the
starting
of
each
trade
however
while
this
is
true
in
a
broad
sense
only
those
who
are
intimately
acquainted
with
each
of
these
trades
are
fully
aware
of
the
fact
that
in
hardly
any
element
of
any
trade
is
there
uniformity
in
the
methods
which
are
used
instead
of
having
only
one
way
which
is
generally
accepted
as
a
standard
there
are
in
daily
use
say
fifty
or
a
hundred
different
ways
of
doing
each
element
of
the
work
and
a
little
thought
will
make
it
clear
that
this
must
inevitably
be
the
case
since
our
methods
have
been
handed
down
from
man
to
man
by
word
of
mouth
or
have
in
most
cases
been
almost
unconsciously
learned
through
personal
observation
practically
in
no
instances
have
they
been
codified
or
systematically
analyzed
or
described
the
ingenuity
and
experience
of
each
generation
of
each
decade
even
have
without
doubt
handed
over
better
methods
to
the
next
this
mass
of
or
traditional
knowledge
may
be
said
to
be
the
principal
asset
or
possession
of
every
tradesman
now
in
the
best
of
the
ordinary
types
of
management
the
managers
recognize
frankly
the
fact
that
the
or
workmen
included
in
the
twenty
to
thirty
trades
who
are
under
them
possess
this
mass
of
traditional
knowledge
a
large
part
of
which
is
not
in
the
possession
of
the
management
the
management
of
course
includes
foremen
and
superintendents
who
themselves
have
been
in
most
cases
workers
at
their
trades
and
yet
these
foremen
and
superintendents
know
better
than
any
one
else
that
their
own
knowledge
and
personal
skill
falls
far
short
of
the
combined
knowledge
and
dexterity
of
all
the
workmen
under
them
the
most
experienced
managers
therefore
frankly
place
before
their
workmen
the
problem
of
doing
the
work
in
the
best
and
most
economical
way
they
recognize
the
task
before
them
as
that
of
inducing
each
workman
to
use
his
best
endeavors
his
hardest
work
all
his
traditional
knowledge
his
skill
his
ingenuity
and
his
in
a
word
his
initiative
so
as
to
yield
the
largest
possible
return
to
his
employer
the
problem
before
the
management
then
may
be
briefly
said
to
be
that
of
obtaining
the
best
initiative
of
every
workman
and
the
writer
uses
the
word
initiative
in
its
broadest
sense
to
cover
all
of
the
good
qualities
sought
for
from
the
men
on
the
other
hand
no
intelligent
manager
would
hope
to
obtain
in
any
full
measure
the
initiative
of
his
workmen
unless
he
felt
that
he
was
giving
them
something
more
than
they
usually
receive
from
their
employers
only
those
among
the
readers
of
this
paper
who
have
been
managers
or
who
have
worked
themselves
at
a
trade
realize
how
far
the
average
workman
falls
short
of
giving
his
employer
his
full
initiative
it
is
well
within
the
mark
to
state
that
in
nineteen
out
of
twenty
industrial
establishments
the
workmen
believe
it
to
be
directly
against
their
interests
to
give
their
employers
their
best
initiative
and
that
instead
of
working
hard
to
do
the
largest
possible
amount
of
work
and
the
best
quality
of
work
for
their
employers
they
deliberately
work
as
slowly
as
they
dare
while
they
at
the
same
time
try
to
make
those
over
them
believe
that
they
are
working
fast
the
writer
has
tried
to
make
the
reason
for
this
unfortunate
state
of
things
clear
in
a
paper
entitled
shop
management
read
before
the
american
society
of
mechanical
engineers
the
writer
repeats
therefore
that
in
order
to
have
any
hope
of
obtaining
the
initiative
of
his
workmen
the
manager
must
give
some
special
incentive
to
his
men
beyond
that
which
is
given
to
the
average
of
the
trade
this
incentive
can
be
given
in
several
different
ways
as
for
example
the
hope
of
rapid
promotion
or
advancement
higher
wages
either
in
the
form
of
generous
prices
or
of
a
premium
or
bonus
of
some
kind
for
good
and
rapid
work
shorter
hours
of
labor
better
surroundings
and
working
conditions
than
are
ordinarily
given
and
above
all
this
special
incentive
should
be
accompanied
by
that
personal
consideration
for
and
friendly
contact
with
his
workmen
which
comes
only
from
a
genuine
and
kindly
interest
in
the
welfare
of
those
under
him
it
is
only
by
giving
a
special
inducement
or
incentive
of
this
kind
that
the
employer
can
hope
even
approximately
to
get
the
initiative
of
his
workmen
under
the
ordinary
type
of
management
the
necessity
for
offering
the
workman
a
special
inducement
has
come
to
be
so
generally
recognized
that
a
large
proportion
of
those
most
interested
in
the
subject
look
upon
the
adoption
of
some
one
of
the
modern
schemes
for
paying
men
such
as
piece
work
the
premium
plan
or
the
bonus
plan
for
instance
as
practically
the
whole
system
of
management
under
scientific
management
however
the
particular
pay
system
which
is
adopted
is
merely
one
of
the
subordinate
elements
broadly
speaking
then
the
best
type
of
management
in
ordinary
use
may
be
defined
as
management
in
which
the
workmen
give
their
best
initiative
and
in
return
receive
some
special
incentive
from
their
employers
this
type
of
management
will
be
referred
to
as
the
management
of
initiative
and
incentive
in
contradistinction
to
scientific
management
or
task
management
with
which
it
is
to
be
compared
the
writer
hopes
that
the
management
of
initiative
and
incentive
will
be
recognized
as
representing
the
best
type
in
ordinary
use
and
in
fact
he
believes
that
it
will
be
hard
to
persuade
the
average
manager
that
anything
better
exists
in
the
whole
field
than
this
type
the
task
which
the
writer
has
before
him
then
is
the
difficult
one
of
trying
to
prove
in
a
thoroughly
convincing
way
that
there
is
another
type
of
management
which
is
not
only
better
but
overwhelmingly
better
than
the
management
of
initiative
and
incentive
the
universal
prejudice
in
favor
of
the
management
of
initiative
and
incentive
is
so
strong
that
no
mere
theoretical
advantages
which
can
be
pointed
out
will
be
likely
to
convince
the
average
manager
that
any
other
system
is
better
it
will
be
upon
a
series
of
practical
illustrations
of
the
actual
working
of
the
two
systems
that
the
writer
will
depend
in
his
efforts
to
prove
that
scientific
management
is
so
greatly
superior
to
other
types
certain
elementary
principles
a
certain
philosophy
will
however
be
recognized
as
the
essence
of
that
which
is
being
illustrated
in
all
of
the
practical
examples
which
will
be
given
and
the
broad
principles
in
which
the
scientific
system
differs
from
the
ordinary
or
system
are
so
simple
in
their
nature
that
it
seems
desirable
to
describe
them
before
starting
with
the
illustrations
under
the
old
type
of
management
success
depends
almost
entirely
upon
getting
the
initiative
of
the
workmen
and
it
is
indeed
a
rare
case
in
which
this
initiative
is
really
attained
under
scientific
management
the
initiative
of
the
workmen
that
is
their
hard
work
their
and
their
ingenuity
is
obtained
with
absolute
uniformity
and
to
a
greater
extent
than
is
possible
under
the
old
system
and
in
addition
to
this
improvement
on
the
part
of
the
men
the
managers
assume
new
burdens
new
duties
and
responsibilities
never
dreamed
of
in
the
past
the
managers
assume
for
instance
the
burden
of
gathering
together
all
of
the
traditional
knowledge
which
in
the
past
has
been
possessed
by
the
workmen
and
then
of
classifying
tabulating
and
reducing
this
knowledge
to
rules
laws
and
formulae
which
are
immensely
helpful
to
the
workmen
in
doing
their
daily
work
in
addition
to
developing
a
science
in
this
way
the
management
take
on
three
other
types
of
duties
which
involve
new
and
heavy
burdens
for
themselves
these
new
duties
are
grouped
under
four
heads
first
they
develop
a
science
for
each
element
of
a
man
work
which
replaces
the
old
method
second
they
scientifically
select
and
then
train
teach
and
develop
the
workman
whereas
in
the
past
he
chose
his
own
work
and
trained
himself
as
best
he
could
third
they
heartily
cooperate
with
the
men
so
as
to
insure
all
of
the
work
being
done
in
accordance
with
the
principles
of
the
science
which
has
been
developed
fourth
there
is
an
almost
equal
division
of
the
work
and
the
responsibility
between
the
management
and
the
workmen
the
management
take
over
all
work
for
which
they
are
better
fitted
than
the
workmen
while
in
the
past
almost
all
of
the
work
and
the
greater
part
of
the
responsibility
were
thrown
upon
the
men
it
is
this
combination
of
the
initiative
of
the
workmen
coupled
with
the
new
types
of
work
done
by
the
management
that
makes
scientific
management
so
much
more
efficient
than
the
old
plan
three
of
these
elements
exist
in
many
cases
under
the
management
of
initiative
and
incentive
in
a
small
and
rudimentary
way
but
they
are
under
this
management
of
minor
importance
whereas
under
scientific
management
they
form
the
very
essence
of
the
whole
system
the
fourth
of
these
elements
an
almost
equal
division
of
the
responsibility
between
the
management
and
the
workmen
requires
further
explanation
the
philosophy
of
the
management
of
initiative
and
incentive
makes
it
necessary
for
each
workman
to
bear
almost
the
entire
responsibility
for
the
general
plan
as
well
as
for
each
detail
of
his
work
and
in
many
cases
for
his
implements
as
well
in
addition
to
this
he
must
do
all
of
the
actual
physical
labor
the
development
of
a
science
on
the
other
hand
involves
the
establishment
of
many
rules
laws
and
formulae
which
replace
the
judgment
of
the
individual
workman
and
which
can
be
effectively
used
only
after
having
been
systematically
recorded
indexed
etc
the
practical
use
of
scientific
data
also
calls
for
a
room
in
which
to
keep
the
books
and
a
desk
for
the
planner
to
work
at
for
example
the
records
containing
the
data
used
under
scientific
management
in
an
ordinary
fill
thousands
of
pages
thus
all
of
the
planning
which
under
the
old
system
was
done
by
the
workman
as
a
result
of
his
personal
experience
must
of
necessity
under
the
new
system
be
done
by
the
management
in
accordance
with
the
laws
of
the
science
because
even
if
the
workman
was
well
suited
to
the
development
and
use
of
scientific
data
it
would
be
physically
impossible
for
him
to
work
at
his
machine
and
at
a
desk
at
the
same
time
it
is
also
clear
that
in
most
cases
one
type
of
man
is
needed
to
plan
ahead
and
an
entirely
different
type
to
execute
the
work
the
man
in
the
planning
room
whose
specialty
under
scientific
management
is
planning
ahead
invariably
finds
that
the
work
can
be
done
better
and
more
economically
by
a
subdivision
of
the
labor
each
act
of
each
mechanic
for
example
should
be
preceded
by
various
preparatory
acts
done
by
other
men
and
all
of
this
involves
as
we
have
said
an
almost
equal
division
of
the
responsibility
and
the
work
between
the
management
and
the
workman
to
summarize
under
the
management
of
initiative
and
incentive
practically
the
whole
problem
is
up
to
the
workman
while
under
scientific
management
fully
of
the
problem
is
up
to
the
management
perhaps
the
most
prominent
single
element
in
modern
scientific
management
is
the
task
idea
the
work
of
every
workman
is
fully
planned
out
by
the
management
at
least
one
day
in
advance
and
each
man
receives
in
most
cases
complete
written
instructions
describing
in
detail
the
task
which
he
is
to
accomplish
as
well
as
the
means
to
be
used
in
doing
the
work
and
the
work
planned
in
advance
in
this
way
constitutes
a
task
which
is
to
be
solved
as
explained
above
not
by
the
workman
alone
but
in
almost
all
cases
by
the
joint
effort
of
the
workman
and
the
management
this
task
specifies
not
only
what
is
to
be
done
but
how
it
is
to
be
done
and
the
exact
time
allowed
for
doing
it
and
whenever
the
workman
succeeds
in
doing
his
task
right
and
within
the
time
limit
specified
he
receives
an
addition
of
from
per
cent
to
per
cent
to
his
ordinary
wages
these
tasks
are
carefully
planned
so
that
both
good
and
careful
work
are
called
for
in
their
performance
but
it
should
be
distinctly
understood
that
in
no
case
is
the
workman
called
upon
to
work
at
a
pace
which
would
be
injurious
to
his
health
the
task
is
always
so
regulated
that
the
man
who
is
well
suited
to
his
job
will
thrive
while
working
at
this
rate
during
a
long
term
of
years
and
grow
happier
and
more
prosperous
instead
of
being
overworked
scientific
management
consists
very
largely
in
preparing
for
and
carrying
out
these
tasks
the
writer
is
fully
aware
that
to
perhaps
most
of
the
readers
of
this
paper
the
four
elements
which
differentiate
the
new
management
from
the
old
will
at
first
appear
to
be
merely
phrases
and
he
would
again
repeat
that
he
has
no
idea
of
convincing
the
reader
of
their
value
merely
through
announcing
their
existence
his
hope
of
carrying
conviction
rests
upon
demonstrating
the
tremendous
force
and
effect
of
these
four
elements
through
a
series
of
practical
illustrations
it
will
be
shown
first
that
they
can
be
applied
absolutely
to
all
classes
of
work
from
the
most
elementary
to
the
most
intricate
and
second
that
when
they
are
applied
the
results
must
of
necessity
be
overwhelmingly
greater
than
those
which
it
is
possible
to
attain
under
the
management
of
initiative
and
incentive
the
first
illustration
is
that
of
handling
pig
iron
and
this
work
is
chosen
because
it
is
typical
of
perhaps
the
crudest
and
most
elementary
form
of
labor
which
is
performed
by
man
this
work
is
done
by
men
with
no
other
implements
than
their
hands
the
handler
stoops
down
picks
up
a
pig
weighing
about
pounds
walks
for
a
few
feet
or
yards
and
then
drops
it
on
to
the
ground
or
upon
a
pile
this
work
is
so
crude
and
elementary
in
its
nature
that
the
writer
firmly
believes
that
it
would
be
possible
to
train
an
intelligent
gorilla
so
as
to
become
a
more
efficient
handler
than
any
man
can
be
yet
it
will
be
shown
that
the
science
of
handling
pig
iron
is
so
great
and
amounts
to
so
much
that
it
is
impossible
for
the
man
who
is
best
suited
to
this
type
of
work
to
understand
the
principles
of
this
science
or
even
to
work
in
accordance
with
these
principles
without
the
aid
of
a
man
better
educated
than
he
is
and
the
further
illustrations
to
be
given
will
make
it
clear
that
in
almost
all
of
the
mechanic
arts
the
science
which
underlies
each
workman
act
is
so
great
and
amounts
to
so
much
that
the
workman
who
is
best
suited
actually
to
do
the
work
is
incapable
either
through
lack
of
education
or
through
insufficient
mental
capacity
of
understanding
this
science
this
is
announced
as
a
general
principle
the
truth
of
which
will
become
apparent
as
one
illustration
after
another
is
given
after
showing
these
four
elements
in
the
handling
of
pig
iron
several
illustrations
will
be
given
of
their
application
to
different
kinds
of
work
in
the
field
of
the
mechanic
arts
at
intervals
in
a
rising
scale
beginning
with
the
simplest
and
ending
with
the
more
intricate
forms
of
labor
one
of
the
first
pieces
of
work
undertaken
by
us
when
the
writer
started
to
introduce
scientific
management
into
the
bethlehem
steel
company
was
to
handle
pig
iron
on
task
work
the
opening
of
the
spanish
war
found
some
tons
of
pig
iron
placed
in
small
piles
in
an
open
field
adjoining
the
works
prices
for
pig
iron
had
been
so
low
that
it
could
not
be
sold
at
a
profit
and
it
therefore
had
been
stored
with
the
opening
of
the
spanish
war
the
price
of
pig
iron
rose
and
this
large
accumulation
of
iron
was
sold
this
gave
us
a
good
opportunity
to
show
the
workmen
as
well
as
the
owners
and
managers
of
the
works
on
a
fairly
large
scale
the
advantages
of
task
work
over
the
day
work
and
piece
work
in
doing
a
very
elementary
class
of
work
the
bethlehem
steel
company
had
five
blast
furnaces
the
product
of
which
had
been
handled
by
a
gang
for
many
years
this
gang
at
this
time
consisted
of
about
men
they
were
good
average
handlers
were
under
an
excellent
foreman
who
himself
had
been
a
handler
and
the
work
was
done
on
the
whole
about
as
fast
and
as
cheaply
as
it
was
anywhere
else
at
that
time
a
railroad
switch
was
run
out
into
the
field
right
along
the
edge
of
the
piles
of
pig
iron
an
inclined
plank
was
placed
against
the
side
of
a
car
and
each
man
picked
up
from
his
pile
a
pig
of
iron
weighing
about
pounds
walked
up
the
inclined
plank
and
dropped
it
on
the
end
of
the
car
we
found
that
this
gang
were
loading
on
the
average
about
and
a
half
long
tons
per
man
per
day
we
were
surprised
to
find
after
studying
the
matter
that
a
handler
ought
to
handle
between
and
long
tons
per
day
instead
of
and
a
half
tons
this
task
seemed
to
us
so
very
large
that
we
were
obliged
to
go
over
our
work
several
times
before
we
were
absolutely
sure
that
we
were
right
once
we
were
sure
however
that
tons
was
a
proper
day
work
for
a
handler
the
task
which
faced
us
as
managers
under
the
modern
scientific
plan
was
clearly
before
us
it
was
our
duty
to
see
that
the
tons
of
pig
iron
was
loaded
on
to
the
cars
at
the
rate
of
tons
per
man
per
day
in
place
of
and
a
half
tons
at
which
rate
the
work
was
then
being
done
and
it
was
further
our
duty
to
see
that
this
work
was
done
without
bringing
on
a
strike
among
the
men
without
any
quarrel
with
the
men
and
to
see
that
the
men
were
happier
and
better
contented
when
loading
at
the
new
rate
of
tons
than
they
were
when
loading
at
the
old
rate
of
and
a
half
tons
our
first
step
was
the
scientific
selection
of
the
workman
in
dealing
with
workmen
under
this
type
of
management
it
is
an
inflexible
rule
to
talk
to
and
deal
with
only
one
man
at
a
time
since
each
workman
has
his
own
special
abilities
and
limitations
and
since
we
are
not
dealing
with
men
in
masses
but
are
trying
to
develop
each
individual
man
to
his
highest
state
of
efficiency
and
prosperity
our
first
step
was
to
find
the
proper
workman
to
begin
with
we
therefore
carefully
watched
and
studied
these
men
for
three
or
four
days
at
the
end
of
which
time
we
had
picked
out
four
men
who
appeared
to
be
physically
able
to
handle
pig
iron
at
the
rate
of
tons
per
day
a
careful
study
was
then
made
of
each
of
these
men
we
looked
up
their
history
as
far
back
as
practicable
and
thorough
inquiries
were
made
as
to
the
character
habits
and
the
ambition
of
each
of
them
finally
we
selected
one
from
among
the
four
as
the
most
likely
man
to
start
with
he
was
a
little
pennsylvania
dutchman
who
had
been
observed
to
trot
back
home
for
a
mile
or
so
after
his
work
in
the
evening
about
as
fresh
as
he
was
when
he
came
trotting
down
to
work
in
the
morning
we
found
that
upon
wages
of
a
day
he
had
succeeded
in
buying
a
small
plot
of
ground
and
that
he
was
engaged
in
putting
up
the
walls
of
a
little
house
for
himself
in
the
morning
before
starting
to
work
and
at
night
after
leaving
he
also
had
the
reputation
of
being
exceedingly
close
that
is
of
placing
a
very
high
value
on
a
dollar
as
one
man
whom
we
talked
to
about
him
said
a
penny
looks
about
the
size
of
a
to
him
this
man
we
will
call
schmidt
the
task
before
us
then
narrowed
itself
down
to
getting
schmidt
to
handle
tons
of
pig
iron
per
day
and
making
him
glad
to
do
it
this
was
done
as
follows
schmidt
was
called
out
from
among
the
gang
of
handlers
and
talked
to
somewhat
in
this
way
schmidt
are
you
a
man
vell
i
do
know
vat
you
mean
oh
yes
you
do
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
you
are
a
man
or
not
vell
i
do
know
vat
you
mean
oh
come
now
you
answer
my
questions
what
i
want
to
find
out
is
whether
you
are
a
man
or
one
of
these
cheap
fellows
here
what
i
want
to
find
out
is
whether
you
want
to
earn
a
day
or
whether
you
are
satisfied
with
just
the
same
as
all
those
cheap
fellows
are
getting
did
i
vant
a
day
vas
dot
a
man
vell
yes
i
vas
a
man
oh
you
aggravating
me
of
course
you
want
a
day
every
one
wants
it
you
know
perfectly
well
that
that
has
very
little
to
do
with
your
being
a
man
for
goodness
sake
answer
my
questions
and
do
waste
any
more
of
my
time
now
come
over
here
you
see
that
pile
of
pig
iron
yes
you
see
that
car
yes
well
if
you
are
a
man
you
will
load
that
pig
iron
on
that
car
tomorrow
for
now
do
wake
up
and
answer
my
question
tell
me
whether
you
are
a
man
or
not
vell
did
i
got
for
loading
dot
pig
iron
on
dot
car
yes
of
course
you
do
and
you
get
for
loading
a
pile
like
that
every
day
right
through
the
year
that
is
what
a
man
does
and
you
know
it
just
as
well
as
i
do
vell
dot
all
right
i
could
load
dot
pig
iron
on
the
car
for
and
i
get
it
every
day
do
i
certainly
you
do
certainly
you
do
vell
den
i
vas
a
man
now
hold
on
hold
on
you
know
just
as
well
as
i
do
that
a
man
has
to
do
exactly
as
he
told
from
morning
till
night
you
have
seen
this
man
here
before
have
you
no
i
never
saw
him
well
if
you
are
a
man
you
will
do
exactly
as
this
man
tells
you
tomorrow
from
morning
till
night
when
he
tells
you
to
pick
up
a
pig
and
walk
you
pick
it
up
and
you
walk
and
when
he
tells
you
to
sit
down
and
rest
you
sit
down
you
do
that
right
straight
through
the
day
and
what
more
no
back
talk
now
a
man
does
just
what
he
told
to
do
and
no
back
talk
do
you
understand
that
when
this
man
tells
you
to
walk
you
walk
when
he
tells
you
to
sit
down
you
sit
down
and
you
do
talk
back
at
him
now
you
come
on
to
work
here
morning
and
i
know
before
night
whether
you
are
really
a
man
or
not
this
seems
to
be
rather
rough
talk
and
indeed
it
would
be
if
applied
to
an
educated
mechanic
or
even
an
intelligent
laborer
with
a
man
of
the
mentally
sluggish
type
of
schmidt
it
is
appropriate
and
not
unkind
since
it
is
effective
in
fixing
his
attention
on
the
high
wages
which
he
wants
and
away
from
what
if
it
were
called
to
his
attention
he
probably
would
consider
impossibly
hard
work
what
would
schmidt
answer
be
if
he
were
talked
to
in
a
manner
which
is
usual
under
the
management
of
initiative
and
incentive
say
as
follows
now
schmidt
you
are
a
handler
and
know
your
business
well
you
have
been
handling
at
the
rate
of
and
a
half
tons
per
day
i
have
given
considerable
study
to
handling
pig
iron
and
feel
sure
that
you
could
do
a
much
larger
day
work
than
you
have
been
doing
now
do
you
think
that
if
you
really
tried
you
could
handle
tons
of
pig
iron
per
day
instead
of
and
a
half
tons
what
do
you
think
schmidt
answer
would
be
to
this
schmidt
started
to
work
and
all
day
long
and
at
regular
intervals
was
told
by
the
man
who
stood
over
him
with
a
watch
now
pick
up
a
pig
and
walk
now
sit
down
and
rest
now
walk
now
rest
etc
he
worked
when
he
was
told
to
work
and
rested
when
he
was
told
to
rest
and
at
five
in
the
afternoon
had
his
and
a
half
tons
loaded
on
the
car
and
he
practically
never
failed
to
work
at
this
pace
and
do
the
task
that
was
set
him
during
the
three
years
that
the
writer
was
at
bethlehem
and
throughout
this
time
he
averaged
a
little
more
than
per
day
whereas
before
he
had
never
received
over
per
day
which
was
the
ruling
rate
of
wages
at
that
time
in
bethlehem
that
is
he
received
per
cent
higher
wages
than
were
paid
to
other
men
who
were
not
working
on
task
work
one
man
after
another
was
picked
out
and
trained
to
handle
pig
iron
at
the
rate
of
and
a
half
tons
per
day
until
all
of
the
pig
iron
was
handled
at
this
rate
and
the
men
were
receiving
per
cent
more
wages
than
other
workmen
around
them
the
writer
has
given
above
a
brief
description
of
three
of
the
four
elements
which
constitute
the
essence
of
scientific
management
first
the
careful
selection
of
the
workman
and
second
and
third
the
method
of
first
inducing
and
then
training
and
helping
the
workman
to
work
according
to
the
scientific
method
nothing
has
as
yet
been
said
about
the
science
of
handling
pig
iron
the
writer
trusts
however
that
before
leaving
this
illustration
the
reader
will
be
thoroughly
convinced
that
there
is
a
science
of
handling
pig
iron
and
further
that
this
science
amounts
to
so
much
that
the
man
who
is
suited
to
handle
pig
iron
can
not
possibly
understand
it
nor
even
work
in
accordance
with
the
laws
of
this
science
without
the
help
of
those
who
are
over
him
the
writer
came
into
the
of
the
midvale
steel
company
in
after
having
served
an
apprenticeship
as
a
and
as
a
machinist
this
was
close
to
the
end
of
the
long
period
of
depression
following
the
panic
of
and
business
was
so
poor
that
it
was
impossible
for
many
mechanics
to
get
work
at
their
trades
for
this
reason
he
was
obliged
to
start
as
a
day
laborer
instead
of
working
as
a
mechanic
fortunately
for
him
soon
after
he
came
into
the
shop
the
clerk
of
the
shop
was
found
stealing
there
was
no
one
else
available
and
so
having
more
education
than
the
other
laborers
since
he
had
been
prepared
for
college
he
was
given
the
position
of
clerk
shortly
after
this
he
was
given
work
as
a
machinist
in
running
one
of
the
lathes
and
as
he
turned
out
rather
more
work
than
other
machinists
were
doing
on
similar
lathes
after
several
months
was
made
gang
boss
over
the
lathes
almost
all
of
the
work
of
this
shop
had
been
done
on
piece
work
for
several
years
as
was
usual
then
and
in
fact
as
is
still
usual
in
most
of
the
shops
in
this
country
the
shop
was
really
run
by
the
workmen
and
not
by
the
bosses
the
workmen
together
had
carefully
planned
just
how
fast
each
job
should
be
done
and
they
had
set
a
pace
for
each
machine
throughout
the
shop
which
was
limited
to
about
of
a
good
day
work
every
new
workman
who
came
into
the
shop
was
told
at
once
by
the
other
men
exactly
how
much
of
each
kind
of
work
he
was
to
do
and
unless
he
obeyed
these
instructions
he
was
sure
before
long
to
be
driven
out
of
the
place
by
the
men
as
soon
as
the
writer
was
made
one
after
another
of
the
men
came
to
him
and
talked
somewhat
as
follows
now
fred
we
very
glad
to
see
that
you
been
made
you
know
the
game
all
right
and
we
sure
that
you
not
likely
to
be
a
hog
you
come
along
with
us
and
will
be
all
right
but
if
you
try
breaking
any
of
these
rates
you
can
be
mighty
sure
that
we
throw
you
over
the
fence
the
writer
told
them
plainly
that
he
was
now
working
on
the
side
of
the
management
and
that
he
proposed
to
do
whatever
he
could
to
get
a
fair
day
work
out
of
the
lathes
this
immediately
started
a
war
in
most
cases
a
friendly
war
because
the
men
who
were
under
him
were
his
personal
friends
but
none
the
less
a
war
which
as
time
went
on
grew
more
and
more
bitter
the
writer
used
every
expedient
to
make
them
do
a
fair
day
work
such
as
discharging
or
lowering
the
wages
of
the
more
stubborn
men
who
refused
to
make
any
improvement
and
such
as
lowering
the
price
hiring
green
men
and
personally
teaching
them
how
to
do
the
work
with
the
promise
from
them
that
when
they
had
learned
how
they
would
then
do
a
fair
day
work
while
the
men
constantly
brought
such
pressure
to
bear
both
inside
and
outside
the
works
upon
all
those
who
started
to
increase
their
output
that
they
were
finally
compelled
to
do
about
as
the
rest
did
or
else
quit
no
one
who
has
not
had
this
experience
can
have
an
idea
of
the
bitterness
which
is
gradually
developed
in
such
a
struggle
in
a
war
of
this
kind
the
workmen
have
one
expedient
which
is
usually
effective
they
use
their
ingenuity
to
contrive
various
ways
in
which
the
machines
which
they
are
running
are
broken
or
damaged
apparently
by
accident
or
in
the
regular
course
of
work
and
this
they
always
lay
at
the
door
of
the
foreman
who
has
forced
them
to
drive
the
machine
so
hard
that
it
is
overstrained
and
is
being
ruined
and
there
are
few
foremen
indeed
who
are
able
to
stand
up
against
the
combined
pressure
of
all
of
the
men
in
the
shop
in
this
case
the
problem
was
complicated
by
the
fact
that
the
shop
ran
both
day
and
night
the
writer
had
two
advantages
however
which
are
not
possessed
by
the
ordinary
foreman
and
these
came
curiously
enough
from
the
fact
that
he
was
not
the
son
of
a
working
man
first
owing
to
the
fact
that
he
happened
not
to
be
of
working
parents
the
owners
of
the
company
believed
that
he
had
the
interest
of
the
works
more
at
heart
than
the
other
workmen
and
they
therefore
had
more
confidence
in
his
word
than
they
did
in
that
of
the
machinists
who
were
under
him
so
that
when
the
machinists
reported
to
the
superintendent
that
the
machines
were
being
smashed
up
because
an
incompetent
foreman
was
overstraining
them
the
superintendent
accepted
the
word
of
the
writer
when
he
said
that
these
men
were
deliberately
breaking
their
machines
as
a
part
of
the
war
which
was
going
on
and
he
also
allowed
the
writer
to
make
the
only
effective
answer
to
this
vandalism
on
the
part
of
the
men
namely
there
will
be
no
more
accidents
to
the
machines
in
this
shop
if
any
part
of
a
machine
is
broken
the
man
in
charge
of
it
must
pay
at
least
a
part
of
the
cost
of
its
repair
and
the
fines
collected
in
this
way
will
all
be
handed
over
to
the
mutual
beneficial
association
to
help
care
for
sick
workmen
this
soon
stopped
the
willful
breaking
of
machines
second
if
the
writer
had
been
one
of
the
workmen
and
had
lived
where
they
lived
they
would
have
brought
such
social
pressure
to
bear
upon
him
that
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
have
stood
out
against
them
he
would
have
been
called
scab
and
other
foul
names
every
time
he
appeared
on
the
street
his
wife
would
have
been
abused
and
his
children
would
have
been
stoned
once
or
twice
he
was
begged
by
some
of
his
friends
among
the
workmen
not
to
walk
home
about
two
and
a
half
miles
along
the
lonely
path
by
the
side
of
the
railway
he
was
told
that
if
he
continued
to
do
this
it
would
be
at
the
risk
of
his
life
in
all
such
cases
however
a
display
of
timidity
is
apt
to
increase
rather
than
diminish
the
risk
so
the
writer
told
these
men
to
say
to
the
other
men
in
the
shop
that
he
proposed
to
walk
home
every
night
right
up
that
railway
track
that
he
never
had
carried
and
never
would
carry
any
weapon
of
any
kind
and
that
they
could
shoot
and
be
d
after
about
three
years
of
this
kind
of
struggling
the
output
of
the
machines
had
been
materially
increased
in
many
cases
doubled
and
as
a
result
the
writer
had
been
promoted
from
one
to
another
until
he
became
foreman
of
the
shop
for
any
man
however
this
success
is
in
no
sense
a
recompense
for
the
bitter
relations
which
he
is
forced
to
maintain
with
all
of
those
around
him
life
which
is
one
continuous
struggle
with
other
men
is
hardly
worth
living
his
workman
friends
came
to
him
continually
and
asked
him
in
a
personal
friendly
way
whether
he
would
advise
them
for
their
own
best
interest
to
turn
out
more
work
and
as
a
truthful
man
he
had
to
tell
them
that
if
he
were
in
their
place
he
would
fight
against
turning
out
any
more
work
just
as
they
were
doing
because
under
the
system
they
would
be
allowed
to
earn
no
more
wages
than
they
had
been
earning
and
yet
they
would
be
made
to
work
harder
soon
after
being
made
foreman
therefore
he
decided
to
make
a
determined
effort
to
in
some
way
change
the
system
of
management
so
that
the
interests
of
the
workmen
and
the
management
should
become
the
same
instead
of
antagonistic
this
resulted
some
three
years
later
in
the
starting
of
the
type
of
management
which
is
described
in
papers
presented
to
the
american
society
of
mechanical
engineers
entitled
a
system
and
shop
management
in
preparation
for
this
system
the
writer
realized
that
the
greatest
obstacle
to
harmonious
cooperation
between
the
workmen
and
the
management
lay
in
the
ignorance
of
the
management
as
to
what
really
constitutes
a
proper
day
work
for
a
workman
he
fully
realized
that
although
he
was
foreman
of
the
shop
the
combined
knowledge
and
skill
of
the
workmen
who
were
under
him
was
certainly
ten
times
as
great
as
his
own
he
therefore
obtained
the
permission
of
william
sellers
who
was
at
that
time
the
president
of
the
midvale
steel
company
to
spend
some
money
in
a
careful
scientific
study
of
the
time
required
to
do
various
kinds
of
work
mr
sellers
allowed
this
more
as
a
reward
for
having
to
a
certain
extent
made
good
as
foreman
of
the
shop
in
getting
more
work
out
of
the
men
than
for
any
other
reason
he
stated
however
that
he
did
not
believe
that
any
scientific
study
of
this
sort
would
give
results
of
much
value
among
several
investigations
which
were
undertaken
at
this
time
one
was
an
attempt
to
find
some
rule
or
law
which
would
enable
a
foreman
to
know
in
advance
how
much
of
any
kind
of
heavy
laboring
work
a
man
who
was
well
suited
to
his
job
ought
to
do
in
a
day
that
is
to
study
the
tiring
effect
of
heavy
labor
upon
a
man
our
first
step
was
to
employ
a
young
college
graduate
to
look
up
all
that
had
been
written
on
the
subject
in
english
german
and
french
two
classes
of
experiments
had
been
made
one
by
physiologists
who
were
studying
the
endurance
of
the
human
animal
and
the
other
by
engineers
who
wished
to
determine
what
fraction
of
a
a
was
these
experiments
had
been
made
largely
upon
men
who
were
lifting
loads
by
means
of
turning
the
crank
of
a
winch
from
which
weights
were
suspended
and
others
who
were
engaged
in
walking
running
and
lifting
weights
in
various
ways
however
the
records
of
these
investigations
were
so
meager
that
no
law
of
any
value
could
be
deduced
from
them
we
therefore
started
a
series
of
experiments
of
our
own
two
laborers
were
selected
men
who
had
proved
themselves
to
be
physically
powerful
and
who
were
also
good
steady
workers
these
men
were
paid
double
wages
during
the
experiments
and
were
told
that
they
must
work
to
the
best
of
their
ability
at
all
times
and
that
we
should
make
certain
tests
with
them
from
time
to
time
to
find
whether
they
were
soldiering
or
not
and
that
the
moment
either
one
of
them
started
to
try
to
deceive
us
he
would
be
discharged
they
worked
to
the
best
of
their
ability
throughout
the
time
that
they
were
being
observed
now
it
must
be
clearly
understood
that
in
these
experiments
we
were
not
trying
to
find
the
maximum
work
that
a
man
could
do
on
a
short
spurt
or
for
a
few
days
but
that
our
endeavor
was
to
learn
what
really
constituted
a
full
day
work
for
a
man
the
best
day
work
that
a
man
could
properly
do
year
in
and
year
out
and
still
thrive
under
these
men
were
given
all
kinds
of
tasks
which
were
carried
out
each
day
under
the
close
observation
of
the
young
college
man
who
was
conducting
the
experiments
and
who
at
the
same
time
noted
with
a
the
proper
time
for
all
of
the
motions
that
were
made
by
the
men
every
element
in
any
way
connected
with
the
work
which
we
believed
could
have
a
bearing
on
the
result
was
carefully
studied
and
recorded
what
we
hoped
ultimately
to
determine
was
what
fraction
of
a
a
man
was
able
to
exert
that
is
how
many
of
work
a
man
could
do
in
a
day
after
completing
this
series
of
experiments
therefore
each
man
work
for
each
day
was
translated
into
of
energy
and
to
our
surprise
we
found
that
there
was
no
constant
or
uniform
relation
between
the
of
energy
which
the
man
exerted
during
a
day
and
the
tiring
effect
of
his
work
on
some
kinds
of
work
the
man
would
be
tired
out
when
doing
perhaps
not
more
than
of
a
while
in
others
he
would
be
tired
to
no
greater
extent
by
doing
half
a
of
work
we
failed
therefore
to
find
any
law
which
was
an
accurate
guide
to
the
maximum
day
work
for
a
workman
a
large
amount
of
very
valuable
data
had
been
obtained
which
enabled
us
to
know
for
many
kinds
of
labor
what
was
a
proper
day
work
it
did
not
seem
wise
however
at
this
time
to
spend
any
more
money
in
trying
to
find
the
exact
law
which
we
were
after
some
years
later
when
more
money
was
available
for
this
purpose
a
second
series
of
experiments
was
made
similar
to
the
first
but
some
what
more
thorough
this
however
resulted
as
the
first
experiments
in
obtaining
valuable
information
but
not
in
the
development
of
a
law
again
some
years
later
a
third
series
of
experiments
was
made
and
this
time
no
trouble
was
spared
in
our
endeavor
to
make
the
work
thorough
every
minute
element
which
could
in
anyway
affect
the
problem
was
carefully
noted
and
studied
and
two
college
men
devoted
about
three
months
to
the
experiments
after
this
data
was
again
translated
into
of
energy
exerted
for
each
man
each
day
it
became
perfectly
clear
that
there
is
no
direct
relation
between
the
which
a
man
exerts
that
is
his
of
energy
per
day
and
the
tiring
effect
of
the
work
on
the
man
the
writer
however
was
quite
as
firmly
convinced
as
ever
that
some
definite
law
existed
as
to
what
constitutes
a
full
day
work
for
a
laborer
and
our
data
had
been
so
carefully
collected
and
recorded
that
he
felt
sure
that
the
necessary
information
was
included
somewhere
in
the
records
the
problem
of
developing
this
law
from
the
accumulated
facts
was
therefore
handed
over
to
carl
barth
who
is
a
better
mathematician
than
any
of
the
rest
of
us
and
we
decided
to
investigate
the
problem
in
a
new
way
by
graphically
representing
each
element
of
the
work
through
plotting
curves
which
should
give
us
as
it
were
a
view
of
every
element
in
a
comparatively
short
time
barth
had
discovered
the
law
governing
the
tiring
effect
of
heavy
labor
on
a
man
and
it
is
so
simple
in
its
nature
that
it
is
truly
remarkable
that
it
should
not
have
been
discovered
and
clearly
understood
years
before
the
law
which
was
developed
is
as
follows
the
law
is
confined
to
that
class
of
work
in
which
the
limit
of
a
capacity
is
reached
because
he
is
tired
out
it
is
the
law
of
heavy
laboring
corresponding
to
the
work
of
the
cart
horse
rather
than
that
of
the
trotter
practically
all
such
work
consists
of
a
heavy
pull
or
a
push
on
the
man
arms
that
is
the
man
strength
is
exerted
by
either
lifting
or
pushing
something
which
he
grasps
in
his
hands
and
the
law
is
that
for
each
given
pull
or
push
on
the
man
arms
it
is
possible
for
the
workman
to
be
under
load
for
only
a
definite
percentage
of
the
day
for
example
when
pig
iron
is
being
handled
each
pig
weighing
pounds
a
workman
can
only
be
under
load
per
cent
of
the
day
he
must
be
entirely
free
from
load
during
per
cent
of
the
day
and
as
the
load
becomes
lighter
the
percentage
of
the
day
under
which
the
man
can
remain
under
load
increases
so
that
if
the
workman
is
handling
a
weighing
pounds
he
can
then
be
under
load
per
cent
of
the
day
and
only
has
to
rest
during
per
cent
as
the
weight
grows
lighter
the
man
can
remain
under
load
during
a
larger
and
larger
percentage
of
the
day
until
finally
a
load
is
reached
which
he
can
carry
in
his
hands
all
day
long
without
being
tired
out
when
that
point
has
been
arrived
at
this
law
ceases
to
be
useful
as
a
guide
to
a
laborer
endurance
and
some
other
law
must
be
found
which
indicates
the
man
capacity
for
work
when
a
laborer
is
carrying
a
piece
of
pig
iron
weighing
pounds
in
his
hands
it
tires
him
about
as
much
to
stand
still
under
the
load
as
it
does
to
walk
with
it
since
his
arm
muscles
are
under
the
same
severe
tension
whether
he
is
moving
or
not
a
man
however
who
stands
still
under
a
load
is
exerting
no
whatever
and
this
accounts
for
the
fact
that
no
constant
relation
could
be
traced
in
various
kinds
of
heavy
laboring
work
between
the
of
energy
exerted
and
the
tiring
effect
of
the
work
on
the
man
it
will
also
be
clear
that
in
all
work
of
this
kind
it
is
necessary
for
the
arms
of
the
workman
to
be
completely
free
from
load
that
is
for
the
workman
to
rest
at
frequent
intervals
throughout
the
time
that
the
man
is
under
a
heavy
load
the
tissues
of
his
arm
muscles
are
in
process
of
degeneration
and
frequent
periods
of
rest
are
required
in
order
that
the
blood
may
have
a
chance
to
restore
these
tissues
to
their
normal
condition
to
return
now
to
our
handlers
at
the
bethlehem
steel
company
if
schmidt
had
been
allowed
to
attack
the
pile
of
tons
of
pig
iron
without
the
guidance
or
direction
of
a
man
who
understood
the
art
or
science
of
handling
pig
iron
in
his
desire
to
earn
his
high
wages
he
would
probably
have
tired
himself
out
by
or
in
the
day
he
would
have
kept
so
steadily
at
work
that
his
muscles
would
not
have
had
the
proper
periods
of
rest
absolutely
needed
for
recuperation
and
he
would
have
been
completely
exhausted
early
in
the
day
by
having
a
man
however
who
understood
this
law
stand
over
him
and
direct
his
work
day
after
day
until
he
acquired
the
habit
of
resting
at
proper
intervals
he
was
able
to
work
at
an
even
gait
all
day
long
without
unduly
tiring
himself
now
one
of
the
very
first
requirements
for
a
man
who
is
fit
to
handle
pig
iron
as
a
regular
occupation
that
he
shall
be
so
stupid
and
so
phlegmatic
that
he
more
nearly
resembles
in
his
mental
the
ox
than
any
other
type
the
man
who
is
mentally
alert
and
intelligent
is
for
this
very
reason
entirely
unsuited
to
what
would
for
him
be
the
grinding
monotony
of
work
of
this
character
therefore
the
workman
who
is
best
suited
to
handling
pig
iron
is
unable
to
understand
the
real
science
of
doing
this
class
of
work
he
is
so
stupid
that
the
word
percentage
has
no
meaning
to
him
and
he
must
consequently
be
trained
by
a
man
more
intelligent
than
himself
into
the
habit
of
working
in
accordance
with
the
laws
of
this
science
before
he
can
be
successful
the
writer
trusts
that
it
is
now
clear
that
even
in
the
case
of
the
most
elementary
form
of
labor
that
is
known
there
is
a
science
and
that
when
the
man
best
suited
to
this
class
of
work
has
been
carefully
selected
when
the
science
of
doing
the
work
has
been
developed
and
when
the
carefully
selected
man
has
been
trained
to
work
in
accordance
with
this
science
the
results
obtained
must
of
necessity
be
overwhelmingly
greater
than
those
which
are
possible
under
the
plan
of
initiative
and
incentive
let
us
however
again
turn
to
the
case
of
these
handlers
and
see
whether
under
the
ordinary
type
of
management
it
would
not
have
been
possible
to
obtain
practically
the
same
results
the
writer
has
put
the
problem
before
many
good
managers
and
asked
them
whether
under
premium
work
piece
work
or
any
of
the
ordinary
plans
of
management
they
would
be
likely
even
to
approximate
per
man
per
day
and
not
a
man
has
suggested
that
an
output
of
over
to
tons
could
be
attained
by
any
of
the
ordinary
expedients
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
bethlehem
men
were
loading
only
tons
per
man
many
people
have
questioned
the
accuracy
of
the
statement
that
workmen
can
load
tons
of
pig
iron
from
the
ground
on
to
a
car
in
a
day
for
those
who
are
skeptical
therefore
the
following
data
relating
to
this
work
are
given
first
that
our
experiments
indicated
the
existence
of
the
following
law
that
a
laborer
suited
to
such
work
as
handling
pig
iron
could
be
under
load
only
per
cent
of
the
day
and
must
be
free
from
load
per
cent
of
the
day
second
that
a
man
in
loading
pig
iron
from
piles
placed
on
the
ground
in
an
open
field
on
to
a
car
which
stood
on
a
track
adjoining
these
piles
ought
to
handle
and
that
they
did
handle
regularly
long
tons
pounds
per
ton
per
day
that
the
price
paid
for
loading
this
pig
iron
was
cents
per
ton
and
that
the
men
working
at
it
averaged
per
day
whereas
in
the
past
they
had
been
paid
only
per
day
in
addition
to
these
facts
the
following
are
given
long
tons
equal
pounds
of
pig
iron
per
day
at
pounds
per
pig
equals
pigs
per
day
per
cent
of
a
day
under
load
equals
minutes
multiplied
by
equals
minutes
under
load
minutes
divided
by
pigs
equals
minutes
per
pig
under
load
a
handler
walks
on
the
level
at
the
rate
of
one
foot
in
minutes
the
average
distance
of
the
piles
of
pig
iron
from
the
car
was
feet
it
is
a
fact
however
that
many
of
the
handlers
ran
with
their
pig
as
soon
as
they
reached
the
inclined
plank
many
of
them
also
would
run
down
the
plank
after
loading
the
car
so
that
when
the
actual
loading
went
on
many
of
them
moved
at
a
faster
rate
than
is
indicated
by
the
above
figures
practically
the
men
were
made
to
take
a
rest
generally
by
sitting
down
after
loading
ten
to
twenty
pigs
this
rest
was
in
addition
to
the
time
which
it
took
them
to
walk
back
from
the
car
to
the
pile
it
is
likely
that
many
of
those
who
are
skeptical
about
the
possibility
of
loading
this
amount
of
pig
iron
do
not
realize
that
while
these
men
were
walking
back
they
were
entirely
free
from
load
and
that
therefore
their
muscles
had
during
that
time
the
opportunity
for
recuperation
it
will
be
noted
that
with
an
average
distance
of
feet
of
the
pig
iron
from
the
car
these
men
walked
about
eight
miles
under
load
each
day
and
eight
miles
free
from
load
if
any
one
who
is
interested
in
these
figures
will
multiply
them
and
divide
them
one
into
the
other
in
various
ways
he
will
find
that
all
of
the
facts
stated
check
up
exactly
to
go
into
the
matter
in
more
detail
however
as
to
the
scientific
selection
of
the
men
it
is
a
fact
that
in
this
gang
of
handlers
only
about
one
man
in
eight
was
physically
capable
of
handling
tons
per
day
with
the
very
best
of
intentions
the
other
seven
out
of
eight
men
were
physically
unable
to
work
at
this
pace
now
the
one
man
in
eight
who
was
able
to
do
this
work
was
in
no
sense
superior
to
the
other
men
who
were
working
on
the
gang
he
merely
happened
to
be
a
man
of
the
type
of
the
ox
no
rare
specimen
of
humanity
difficult
to
find
and
therefore
very
highly
prized
on
the
contrary
he
was
a
man
so
stupid
that
he
was
unfitted
to
do
most
kinds
of
laboring
work
even
the
selection
of
the
man
then
does
not
involve
finding
some
extraordinary
individual
but
merely
picking
out
from
among
very
ordinary
men
the
few
who
are
especially
suited
to
this
type
of
work
although
in
this
particular
gang
only
one
man
in
eight
was
suited
to
doing
the
work
we
had
not
the
slightest
difficulty
in
getting
all
the
men
who
were
needed
some
of
them
from
inside
of
the
works
and
others
from
the
neighboring
country
who
were
exactly
suited
to
the
job
under
the
management
of
initiative
and
incentive
the
attitude
of
the
management
is
that
of
putting
the
work
up
to
the
workmen
what
likelihood
would
there
be
then
under
the
old
type
of
management
of
these
men
properly
selecting
themselves
for
handling
would
they
be
likely
to
get
rid
of
seven
men
out
of
eight
from
their
own
gang
and
retain
only
the
eighth
man
no
and
no
expedient
could
be
devised
which
would
make
these
men
properly
select
themselves
even
if
they
fully
realized
the
necessity
of
doing
so
in
order
to
obtain
high
wages
and
they
are
not
sufficiently
intelligent
properly
to
grasp
this
necessity
the
fact
that
their
friends
or
their
brothers
who
were
working
right
alongside
of
them
would
temporarily
be
thrown
out
of
a
job
because
they
were
not
suited
to
this
kind
of
work
would
entirely
prevent
them
from
properly
selecting
themselves
that
is
from
removing
the
seven
out
of
eight
men
on
the
gang
who
were
unsuited
to
handling
as
to
the
possibility
under
the
old
type
of
management
of
inducing
these
handlers
after
they
had
been
properly
selected
to
work
in
accordance
with
the
science
of
doing
heavy
laboring
namely
having
proper
scientifically
determined
periods
of
rest
in
close
sequence
to
periods
of
work
as
has
been
indicated
before
the
essential
idea
of
the
ordinary
types
of
management
is
that
each
workman
has
become
more
skilled
in
his
own
trade
than
it
is
possible
for
any
one
in
the
management
to
be
and
that
therefore
the
details
of
how
the
work
shall
best
be
done
must
be
left
to
him
the
idea
then
of
taking
one
man
after
another
and
training
him
under
a
competent
teacher
into
new
working
habits
until
he
continually
and
habitually
works
in
accordance
with
scientific
laws
which
have
been
developed
by
some
one
else
is
directly
antagonistic
to
the
old
idea
that
each
workman
can
best
regulate
his
own
way
of
doing
the
work
and
besides
this
the
man
suited
to
handling
pig
iron
is
too
stupid
properly
to
train
himself
thus
it
will
be
seen
that
with
the
ordinary
types
of
management
the
development
of
scientific
knowledge
to
replace
rule
of
thumb
the
scientific
selection
of
the
men
and
inducing
the
men
to
work
in
accordance
with
these
scientific
principles
are
entirely
out
of
the
question
and
this
because
the
philosophy
of
the
old
management
puts
the
entire
responsibility
upon
the
workmen
while
the
philosophy
of
the
new
places
a
great
part
of
it
upon
the
management
with
most
readers
great
sympathy
will
be
aroused
because
seven
out
of
eight
of
these
handlers
were
thrown
out
of
a
job
this
sympathy
is
entirely
wasted
because
almost
all
of
them
were
immediately
given
other
jobs
with
the
bethlehem
steel
company
and
indeed
it
should
be
understood
that
the
removal
of
these
men
from
handling
for
which
they
were
unfit
was
really
a
kindness
to
themselves
because
it
was
the
first
step
toward
finding
them
work
for
which
they
were
peculiarly
fitted
and
at
which
after
receiving
proper
training
they
could
permanently
and
legitimately
earn
higher
wages
although
the
reader
may
be
convinced
that
there
is
a
certain
science
back
of
the
handling
of
pig
iron
still
it
is
more
than
likely
that
he
is
still
skeptical
as
to
the
existence
of
a
science
for
doing
other
kinds
of
laboring
one
of
the
important
objects
of
this
paper
is
to
convince
its
readers
that
every
single
act
of
every
workman
can
be
reduced
to
a
science
with
the
hope
of
fully
convincing
the
reader
of
this
fact
therefore
the
writer
proposes
to
give
several
more
simple
illustrations
from
among
the
thousands
which
are
at
hand
for
example
the
average
man
would
question
whether
there
is
much
of
any
science
in
the
work
of
shoveling
yet
there
is
but
little
doubt
if
any
intelligent
reader
of
this
paper
were
deliberately
to
set
out
to
find
what
may
be
called
the
foundation
of
the
science
of
shoveling
that
with
perhaps
to
hours
of
thought
and
analysis
he
would
be
almost
sure
to
have
arrived
at
the
essence
of
this
science
on
the
other
hand
so
completely
are
the
ideas
still
dominant
that
the
writer
has
never
met
a
single
shovel
contractor
to
whom
it
had
ever
even
occurred
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
the
science
of
shoveling
this
science
is
so
elementary
as
to
be
almost
for
a
shoveler
there
is
a
given
shovel
load
at
which
he
will
do
his
biggest
day
work
what
is
this
shovel
load
will
a
man
do
more
work
per
day
with
a
shovel
load
of
pounds
pounds
pounds
or
pounds
now
this
is
a
question
which
can
be
answered
only
through
carefully
made
experiments
by
first
selecting
two
or
three
shovelers
and
paying
them
extra
wages
for
doing
trustworthy
work
and
then
gradually
varying
the
shovel
load
and
having
all
the
conditions
accompanying
the
work
carefully
observed
for
several
weeks
by
men
who
were
used
to
experimenting
it
was
found
that
a
man
would
do
his
biggest
day
work
with
a
shovel
load
of
about
pounds
for
instance
that
this
man
would
shovel
a
larger
tonnage
per
day
with
a
load
than
with
a
load
or
than
with
an
load
on
his
shovel
it
is
of
course
evident
that
no
shoveler
can
always
take
a
load
of
exactly
pounds
on
his
shovel
but
nevertheless
although
his
load
may
vary
or
pounds
one
way
or
the
other
either
below
or
above
the
pounds
he
will
do
his
biggest
work
when
his
average
for
the
day
is
about
pounds
the
writer
does
not
wish
it
to
be
understood
that
this
is
the
whole
of
the
art
or
science
of
shoveling
there
are
many
other
elements
which
together
go
to
make
up
this
science
but
he
wishes
to
indicate
the
important
effect
which
this
one
piece
of
scientific
knowledge
has
upon
the
work
of
shoveling
at
the
works
of
the
bethlehem
steel
company
for
example
as
a
result
of
this
law
instead
of
allowing
each
shoveler
to
select
and
own
his
own
shovel
it
became
necessary
to
provide
some
to
different
kinds
of
shovels
each
one
appropriate
to
handling
a
given
type
of
material
not
only
so
as
to
enable
the
men
to
handle
an
average
load
of
pounds
but
also
to
adapt
the
shovel
to
several
other
requirements
which
become
perfectly
evident
when
this
work
is
studied
as
a
science
a
large
shovel
tool
room
was
built
in
which
were
stored
not
only
shovels
but
carefully
designed
and
standardized
labor
implements
of
all
kinds
such
as
picks
crowbars
etc
this
made
it
possible
to
issue
to
each
workman
a
shovel
which
would
hold
a
load
of
pounds
of
whatever
class
of
material
they
were
to
handle
a
small
shovel
for
ore
say
or
a
large
one
for
ashes
iron
ore
is
one
of
the
heavy
materials
which
are
handled
in
a
works
of
this
kind
and
rice
coal
owing
to
the
fact
that
it
is
so
slippery
on
the
shovel
is
one
of
the
lightest
materials
and
it
was
found
on
studying
the
plan
at
the
bethlehem
steel
company
where
each
shoveler
owned
his
own
shovel
that
he
would
frequently
go
from
shoveling
ore
with
a
load
of
about
pounds
per
shovel
to
handling
rice
coal
with
a
load
on
the
same
shovel
of
less
than
pounds
in
the
one
case
he
was
so
overloaded
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
do
a
full
day
work
and
in
the
other
case
he
was
so
ridiculously
underloaded
that
it
was
manifestly
impossible
to
even
approximate
a
day
work
briefly
to
illustrate
some
of
the
other
elements
which
go
to
make
up
the
science
of
shoveling
thousands
of
observations
were
made
to
study
just
how
quickly
a
laborer
provided
in
each
case
with
the
proper
type
of
shovel
can
push
his
shovel
into
the
pile
of
materials
and
then
draw
it
out
properly
loaded
these
observations
were
made
first
when
pushing
the
shovel
into
the
body
of
the
pile
next
when
shoveling
on
a
dirt
bottom
that
is
at
the
outside
edge
of
the
pile
and
next
with
a
wooden
bottom
and
finally
with
an
iron
bottom
again
a
similar
accurate
time
study
was
made
of
the
time
required
to
swing
the
shovel
backward
and
then
throw
the
load
for
a
given
horizontal
distance
accompanied
by
a
given
height
this
time
study
was
made
for
various
combinations
of
distance
and
height
with
data
of
this
sort
before
him
coupled
with
the
law
of
endurance
described
in
the
case
of
the
handlers
it
is
evident
that
the
man
who
is
directing
shovelers
can
first
teach
them
the
exact
methods
which
should
be
employed
to
use
their
strength
to
the
very
best
advantage
and
can
then
assign
them
daily
tasks
which
are
so
just
that
the
workman
can
each
day
be
sure
of
earning
the
large
bonus
which
is
paid
whenever
he
successfully
performs
this
task
there
were
about
shovelers
and
laborers
of
this
general
class
in
the
yard
of
the
bethlehem
steel
company
at
this
time
these
men
were
scattered
in
their
work
over
a
yard
which
was
roughly
about
two
miles
long
and
half
a
mile
wide
in
order
that
each
workman
should
be
given
his
proper
implement
and
his
proper
instructions
for
doing
each
new
job
it
was
necessary
to
establish
a
detailed
system
for
directing
men
in
their
work
in
place
of
the
old
plan
of
handling
them
in
large
groups
or
gangs
under
a
few
yard
foremen
as
each
workman
came
into
the
works
in
the
morning
he
took
out
of
his
own
special
pigeonhole
with
his
number
on
the
outside
two
pieces
of
paper
one
of
which
stated
just
what
implements
he
was
to
get
from
the
tool
room
and
where
he
was
to
start
to
work
and
the
second
of
which
gave
the
history
of
his
previous
day
work
that
is
a
statement
of
the
work
which
he
had
done
how
much
he
had
earned
the
day
before
etc
many
of
these
men
were
foreigners
and
unable
to
read
and
write
but
they
all
knew
at
a
glance
the
essence
of
this
report
because
yellow
paper
showed
the
man
that
he
had
failed
to
do
his
full
task
the
day
before
and
informed
him
that
he
had
not
earned
as
much
as
a
day
and
that
none
but
men
would
be
allowed
to
stay
permanently
with
this
gang
the
hope
was
further
expressed
that
he
would
earn
his
full
wages
on
the
following
day
so
that
whenever
the
men
received
white
slips
they
knew
that
everything
was
all
right
and
whenever
they
received
yellow
slips
they
realized
that
they
must
do
better
or
they
would
be
shifted
to
some
other
class
of
work
dealing
with
every
workman
as
a
separate
individual
in
this
way
involved
the
building
of
a
labor
office
for
the
superintendent
and
clerks
who
were
in
charge
of
this
section
of
the
work
in
this
office
every
laborer
work
was
planned
out
well
in
advance
and
the
workmen
were
all
moved
from
place
to
place
by
the
clerks
with
elaborate
diagrams
or
maps
of
the
yard
before
them
very
much
as
chessmen
are
moved
on
a
a
telephone
and
messenger
system
having
been
installed
for
this
purpose
in
this
way
a
large
amount
of
the
time
lost
through
having
too
many
men
in
one
place
and
too
few
in
another
and
through
waiting
between
jobs
was
entirely
eliminated
under
the
old
system
the
workmen
were
kept
day
after
day
in
comparatively
large
gangs
each
under
a
single
foreman
and
the
gang
was
apt
to
remain
of
pretty
nearly
the
same
size
whether
there
was
much
or
little
of
the
particular
kind
of
work
on
hand
which
this
foreman
had
under
his
charge
since
each
gang
had
to
be
kept
large
enough
to
handle
whatever
work
in
its
special
line
was
likely
to
come
along
when
one
ceases
to
deal
with
men
in
large
gangs
or
groups
and
proceeds
to
study
each
workman
as
an
individual
if
the
workman
fails
to
do
his
task
some
competent
teacher
should
be
sent
to
show
him
exactly
how
his
work
can
best
be
done
to
guide
help
and
encourage
him
and
at
the
same
time
to
study
his
possibilities
as
a
workman
so
that
under
the
plan
which
individualizes
each
workman
instead
of
brutally
discharging
the
man
or
lowering
his
wages
for
failing
to
make
good
at
once
he
is
given
the
time
and
the
help
required
to
make
him
proficient
at
his
present
job
or
he
is
shifted
to
another
class
of
work
for
which
he
is
either
mentally
or
physically
better
suited
all
of
this
requires
the
kindly
cooperation
of
the
management
and
involves
a
much
more
elaborate
organization
and
system
than
the
herding
of
men
in
large
gangs
this
organization
consisted
in
this
case
of
one
set
of
men
who
were
engaged
in
the
development
of
the
science
of
laboring
through
time
study
such
as
has
been
described
above
another
set
of
men
mostly
skilled
laborers
themselves
who
were
teachers
and
who
helped
and
guided
the
men
in
their
work
another
set
of
men
who
provided
them
with
the
proper
implements
and
kept
them
in
perfect
order
and
another
set
of
clerks
who
planned
the
work
well
in
advance
moved
the
men
with
the
least
loss
of
time
from
one
place
to
another
and
properly
recorded
each
man
earnings
etc
and
this
furnishes
an
elementary
illustration
of
what
has
been
referred
to
as
cooperation
between
the
management
and
the
workmen
the
question
which
naturally
presents
itself
is
whether
an
elaborate
organization
of
this
sort
can
be
made
to
pay
for
itself
whether
such
an
organization
is
not
this
question
will
best
be
answered
by
a
statement
of
the
results
of
the
third
year
of
working
under
this
plan
old
plan
new
plan
task
work
the
number
of
yard
laborers
was
reduced
from
between
down
to
about
average
number
of
tons
per
man
per
day
average
earnings
per
man
per
day
average
cost
of
handling
a
ton
of
lbs
and
in
computing
the
low
cost
of
per
ton
the
office
and
expenses
and
the
wages
of
all
labor
superintendents
foremen
clerks
men
are
included
during
this
year
the
total
saving
of
the
new
plan
over
the
old
amounted
to
and
during
the
six
months
following
when
all
of
the
work
of
the
yard
was
on
task
work
the
saving
was
at
the
rate
of
between
and
per
year
perhaps
the
most
important
of
all
the
results
attained
was
the
effect
on
the
workmen
themselves
a
careful
inquiry
into
the
condition
of
these
men
developed
the
fact
that
out
of
the
workmen
only
two
were
said
to
be
drinking
men
this
does
not
of
course
imply
that
many
of
them
did
not
take
an
occasional
drink
the
fact
is
that
a
steady
drinker
would
find
it
almost
impossible
to
keep
up
with
the
pace
which
was
set
so
that
they
were
practically
all
sober
many
if
not
most
of
them
were
saving
money
and
they
all
lived
better
than
they
had
before
these
men
constituted
the
finest
body
of
picked
laborers
that
the
writer
has
ever
seen
together
and
they
looked
upon
the
men
who
were
over
them
their
bosses
and
their
teachers
as
their
very
best
friends
not
as
nigger
drivers
forcing
them
to
work
extra
hard
for
ordinary
wages
but
as
friends
who
were
teaching
them
and
helping
them
to
earn
much
higher
wages
than
they
had
ever
earned
before
it
would
have
been
absolutely
impossible
for
any
one
to
have
stirred
up
strife
between
these
men
and
their
employers
and
this
presents
a
very
simple
though
effective
illustration
of
what
is
meant
by
the
words
prosperity
for
the
employee
coupled
with
prosperity
for
the
employer
the
two
principal
objects
of
management
it
is
evident
also
that
this
result
has
been
brought
about
by
the
application
of
the
four
fundamental
principles
of
scientific
management
as
another
illustration
of
the
value
of
a
scientific
study
of
the
motives
which
influence
workmen
in
their
daily
work
the
loss
of
ambition
and
initiative
will
be
cited
which
takes
place
in
workmen
when
they
are
herded
into
gangs
instead
of
being
treated
as
separate
individuals
a
careful
analysis
had
demonstrated
the
fact
that
when
workmen
are
herded
together
in
gangs
each
man
in
the
gang
becomes
far
less
efficient
than
when
his
personal
ambition
is
stimulated
that
when
men
work
in
gangs
their
individual
efficiency
falls
almost
invariably
down
to
or
below
the
level
of
the
worst
man
in
the
gang
and
that
they
are
all
pulled
down
instead
of
being
elevated
by
being
herded
together
for
this
reason
a
general
order
had
been
issued
in
the
bethlehem
steel
works
that
not
more
than
four
men
were
to
be
allowed
to
work
in
a
labor
gang
without
a
special
permit
signed
by
the
general
superintendent
of
the
works
this
special
permit
to
extend
for
one
week
only
it
was
arranged
that
as
far
as
possible
each
laborer
should
be
given
a
separate
individual
task
as
there
were
about
men
at
work
in
the
establishment
the
general
superintendent
had
so
much
to
do
that
there
was
but
little
time
left
for
signing
these
special
permits
after
gang
work
had
been
by
this
means
broken
up
an
unusually
fine
set
of
ore
shovelers
had
been
developed
through
careful
selection
and
individual
scientific
training
each
of
these
men
was
given
a
separate
car
to
unload
each
day
and
his
wages
depended
upon
his
own
personal
work
the
man
who
unloaded
the
largest
amount
of
ore
was
paid
the
highest
wages
and
an
unusual
opportunity
came
for
demonstrating
the
importance
of
individualizing
each
workman
much
of
this
ore
came
from
the
lake
superior
region
and
the
same
ore
was
delivered
both
in
pittsburgh
and
in
bethlehem
in
exactly
similar
cars
there
was
a
shortage
of
ore
handlers
in
pittsburgh
and
hearing
of
the
fine
gang
of
laborers
that
had
been
developed
at
bethlehem
one
of
the
pittsburgh
steel
works
sent
an
agent
to
hire
the
bethlehem
men
the
pittsburgh
men
offered
cents
a
ton
for
unloading
exactly
the
same
ore
with
the
same
shovels
from
the
same
cars
that
were
unloaded
in
bethlehem
for
cents
a
ton
after
carefully
considering
this
situation
it
was
decided
that
it
would
be
unwise
to
pay
more
than
cents
per
ton
for
unloading
the
bethlehem
cars
because
at
this
rate
the
bethlehem
laborers
were
earning
a
little
over
per
man
per
day
and
this
price
was
per
cent
more
than
the
ruling
rate
of
wages
around
bethlehem
a
long
series
of
experiments
coupled
with
close
observation
had
demonstrated
the
fact
that
when
workmen
of
this
caliber
are
given
a
carefully
measured
task
which
calls
for
a
big
day
work
on
their
part
and
that
when
in
return
for
this
extra
effort
they
are
paid
wages
up
to
per
cent
beyond
the
wages
usually
paid
that
this
increase
in
wages
tends
to
make
them
not
only
more
thrifty
but
better
men
in
every
way
that
they
live
rather
better
begin
to
save
money
become
more
sober
and
work
more
steadily
when
on
the
other
hand
they
receive
much
more
than
a
per
cent
increase
in
wages
many
of
them
will
work
irregularly
and
tend
to
become
more
or
less
shiftless
extravagant
and
dissipated
our
experiments
showed
in
other
words
that
it
does
not
do
for
most
men
to
get
rich
too
fast
after
deciding
for
this
reason
not
to
raise
the
wages
of
our
ore
handlers
these
men
were
brought
into
the
office
one
at
a
time
and
talked
to
somewhat
as
follows
now
patrick
you
have
proved
to
us
that
you
are
a
man
you
have
been
earning
every
day
a
little
more
than
and
you
are
just
the
sort
of
man
that
we
want
to
have
in
our
gang
a
man
has
come
here
from
pittsburgh
ho
is
offering
cents
per
ton
for
handling
ore
while
we
can
pay
only
cents
per
ton
i
think
therefore
that
you
had
better
apply
to
this
man
for
a
job
of
course
you
know
we
are
very
sorry
to
have
you
leave
us
but
you
have
proved
yourself
a
man
and
we
are
very
glad
to
see
you
get
this
chance
of
earning
more
money
just
remember
however
that
at
any
time
in
the
future
when
you
get
out
of
a
job
you
can
always
come
right
back
to
us
there
will
always
be
a
job
for
a
man
like
you
in
our
gang
here
almost
all
of
the
ore
handlers
took
this
advice
and
went
to
pittsburgh
but
in
about
six
weeks
most
of
them
were
again
back
in
bethlehem
unloading
ore
at
the
old
rate
of
cents
a
ton
the
writer
had
the
following
talk
with
one
of
these
men
after
he
had
returned
patrick
what
are
you
doing
back
here
i
thought
we
had
gotten
rid
of
you
sir
i
tell
you
how
it
was
when
we
got
out
there
jimmy
and
i
were
put
on
to
a
car
with
eight
other
men
we
started
to
shovel
the
ore
out
just
the
same
as
we
do
here
after
about
half
an
hour
i
saw
a
little
devil
alongside
of
me
doing
pretty
near
nothing
so
i
said
to
him
do
you
go
to
work
unless
we
get
the
ore
out
of
this
car
we
wo
get
any
money
on
he
turned
to
me
and
said
in
are
you
i
said
none
of
your
business
and
the
little
devil
stood
up
to
me
and
said
be
minding
your
own
business
or
throw
you
off
this
car
i
could
have
spit
on
him
and
drowned
him
but
the
rest
of
the
men
put
down
their
shovels
and
looked
as
if
they
were
going
to
back
him
up
so
i
went
round
to
jimmy
and
said
so
that
the
whole
gang
could
hear
it
jimmy
you
and
i
will
throw
a
shovel
full
whenever
this
little
devil
throws
one
and
not
another
shovel
full
so
we
watched
him
and
only
shoveled
when
he
shoveled
when
came
around
though
we
had
less
money
than
we
got
here
at
bethlehem
after
that
jimmy
and
i
went
in
to
the
boss
and
asked
him
for
a
car
to
ourselves
the
same
as
we
got
at
bethlehem
but
he
told
us
to
mind
our
own
business
and
when
another
came
around
we
had
less
money
than
we
got
here
at
bethlehem
so
jimmy
and
i
got
the
gang
together
and
brought
them
all
back
here
to
work
again
when
working
each
man
for
himself
these
men
were
able
to
earn
higher
wages
at
cents
a
ton
than
they
could
earn
when
they
were
paid
cents
a
ton
on
gang
work
and
this
again
shows
the
great
gain
which
results
from
working
according
to
even
the
most
elementary
of
scientific
principles
but
it
also
shows
that
in
the
application
of
the
most
elementary
principles
it
is
necessary
for
the
management
to
do
their
share
of
the
work
in
cooperating
with
the
workmen
the
pittsburgh
managers
knew
just
how
the
results
had
been
attained
at
bethlehem
but
they
were
unwilling
to
go
to
the
small
trouble
and
expense
required
to
plan
ahead
and
assign
a
separate
car
to
each
shoveler
and
then
keep
an
individual
record
of
each
man
work
and
pay
him
just
what
he
had
earned
bricklaying
is
one
of
the
oldest
of
our
trades
for
hundreds
of
years
there
has
been
little
or
no
improvement
made
in
the
implements
and
materials
used
in
this
trade
nor
in
fact
in
the
method
of
laying
bricks
in
spite
of
the
millions
of
men
who
have
practiced
this
trade
no
great
improvement
has
been
evolved
for
many
generations
here
then
at
least
one
would
expect
to
find
but
little
gain
possible
through
scientific
analysis
and
study
frank
gilbreth
a
member
of
our
society
who
had
himself
studied
bricklaying
in
his
youth
became
interested
in
the
principles
of
scientific
management
and
decided
to
apply
them
to
the
art
of
bricklaying
he
made
an
intensely
interesting
analysis
and
study
of
each
movement
of
the
bricklayer
and
one
after
another
eliminated
all
unnecessary
movements
and
substituted
fast
for
slow
motions
he
experimented
with
every
minute
element
which
in
any
way
affects
the
speed
and
the
tiring
of
the
bricklayer
he
developed
the
exact
position
which
each
of
the
feet
of
the
bricklayer
should
occupy
with
relation
to
the
wall
the
mortar
box
and
the
pile
of
bricks
and
so
made
it
unnecessary
for
him
to
take
a
step
or
two
toward
the
pile
of
bricks
and
back
again
each
time
a
brick
is
laid
he
studied
the
best
height
for
the
mortar
box
and
brick
pile
and
then
designed
a
scaffold
with
a
table
on
it
upon
which
all
of
the
materials
are
placed
so
as
to
keep
the
bricks
the
mortar
the
man
and
the
wall
in
their
proper
relative
positions
these
scaffolds
are
adjusted
as
the
wall
grows
in
height
for
all
of
the
bricklayers
by
a
laborer
especially
detailed
for
this
purpose
and
by
this
means
the
bricklayer
is
saved
the
exertion
of
stooping
down
to
the
level
of
his
feet
for
each
brick
and
each
trowel
full
of
mortar
and
then
straightening
up
again
think
of
the
waste
of
effort
that
has
gone
on
through
all
these
years
with
each
bricklayer
lowering
his
body
weighing
say
pounds
down
two
feet
and
raising
it
up
again
every
time
a
brick
weighing
about
pounds
is
laid
in
the
wall
and
this
each
bricklayer
did
about
one
thousand
times
a
day
as
a
result
of
further
study
after
the
bricks
are
unloaded
from
the
cars
and
before
bringing
them
to
the
bricklayer
they
are
carefully
sorted
by
a
laborer
and
placed
with
their
best
edge
up
on
a
simple
wooden
frame
constructed
so
as
to
enable
him
to
take
hold
of
each
brick
in
the
quickest
time
and
in
the
most
advantageous
position
in
this
way
the
bricklayer
avoids
either
having
to
turn
the
brick
over
or
end
for
end
to
examine
it
before
laying
it
and
he
saves
also
the
time
taken
in
deciding
which
is
the
best
edge
and
end
to
place
on
the
outside
of
the
wall
in
most
cases
also
he
saves
the
time
taken
in
disentangling
the
brick
from
a
disorderly
pile
on
the
scaffold
this
pack
of
bricks
as
gilbreth
calls
his
loaded
wooden
frames
is
placed
by
the
helper
in
its
proper
position
on
the
adjustable
scaffold
close
to
the
mortar
box
we
have
all
been
used
to
seeing
bricklayers
tap
each
brick
after
it
is
placed
on
its
bed
of
mortar
several
times
with
the
end
of
the
handle
of
the
trowel
so
as
to
secure
the
right
thickness
for
the
joint
gilbreth
found
that
by
tempering
the
mortar
just
right
the
bricks
could
be
readily
bedded
to
the
proper
depth
by
a
downward
pressure
of
the
hand
with
which
they
are
laid
he
insisted
that
his
mortar
mixers
should
give
special
attention
to
tempering
the
mortar
and
so
save
the
time
consumed
in
tapping
the
brick
through
all
of
this
minute
study
of
the
motions
to
be
made
by
the
bricklayer
in
laying
bricks
under
standard
conditions
gilbreth
has
reduced
his
movements
from
eighteen
motions
per
brick
to
five
and
even
in
one
case
to
as
low
as
two
motions
per
brick
he
has
given
all
of
the
details
of
this
analysis
to
the
profession
in
the
chapter
headed
motion
study
of
his
book
entitled
bricklaying
system
published
by
myron
clerk
publishing
company
new
york
and
chicago
spon
of
london
an
analysis
of
the
expedients
used
by
gilbreth
in
reducing
the
motions
of
his
bricklayers
from
eighteen
to
five
shows
that
this
improvement
has
been
made
in
three
different
ways
first
he
has
entirely
dispensed
with
certain
movements
which
the
bricklayers
in
the
past
believed
were
necessary
but
which
a
careful
study
and
trial
on
his
part
have
shown
to
be
useless
second
he
has
introduced
simple
apparatus
such
as
his
adjustable
scaffold
and
his
packets
for
holding
the
bricks
by
means
of
which
with
a
very
small
amount
of
cooperation
from
a
cheap
laborer
he
entirely
eliminates
a
lot
of
tiresome
and
motions
which
are
necessary
for
the
who
lacks
the
scaffold
and
the
packet
third
he
teaches
his
bricklayers
to
make
simple
motions
with
both
hands
at
the
same
time
where
before
they
completed
a
motion
with
the
right
hand
and
followed
it
later
with
one
from
the
left
hand
for
example
gilbreth
teaches
his
to
pick
up
a
brick
in
the
left
hand
at
the
same
instant
that
he
takes
a
trowel
full
of
mortar
with
the
right
hand
this
work
with
two
hands
at
the
same
time
is
of
course
made
possible
by
substituting
a
deep
mortar
box
for
the
old
mortar
board
on
which
the
mortar
spread
out
so
thin
that
a
step
or
two
had
to
be
taken
to
reach
it
and
then
placing
the
mortar
box
and
the
brick
pile
close
together
and
at
the
proper
height
on
his
new
scaffold
these
three
kinds
of
improvements
are
typical
of
the
ways
in
which
needless
motions
can
be
entirely
eliminated
and
quicker
types
of
movements
substituted
for
slow
movements
when
scientific
motion
study
as
gilbreth
calls
his
analysis
time
study
as
the
writer
has
called
similar
work
are
applied
in
any
trade
most
practical
men
would
knowing
the
opposition
of
almost
all
tradesmen
to
making
any
change
in
their
methods
and
habits
however
be
skeptical
as
to
the
possibility
of
actually
achieving
any
large
results
from
a
study
of
this
sort
gilbreth
reports
that
a
few
months
ago
in
a
large
brick
building
which
he
erected
he
demonstrated
on
a
commercial
scale
the
great
gain
which
is
possible
from
practically
applying
his
scientific
study
with
union
bricklayers
in
laying
a
factory
wall
twelve
inches
thick
with
two
kinds
of
brick
faced
and
ruled
joints
on
both
sides
of
the
wall
he
averaged
after
his
selected
workmen
had
become
skilful
in
his
new
methods
bricks
per
man
per
hour
whereas
the
average
speed
of
doing
this
work
with
the
old
methods
was
in
that
section
of
the
country
bricks
per
man
per
hour
his
bricklayers
were
taught
his
new
method
of
bricklaying
by
their
foreman
those
who
failed
to
profit
by
their
teaching
were
dropped
and
each
man
as
he
became
proficient
under
the
new
method
received
a
substantial
not
a
small
increase
in
his
wages
with
a
view
to
individualizing
his
workmen
and
stimulating
each
man
to
do
his
best
gilbreth
also
developed
an
ingenious
method
for
measuring
and
recording
the
number
of
bricks
laid
by
each
man
and
for
telling
each
workman
at
frequent
intervals
how
many
bricks
he
had
succeeded
in
laying
it
is
only
when
this
work
is
compared
with
the
conditions
which
prevail
under
the
tyranny
of
some
of
our
misguided
bricklayers
unions
that
the
great
waste
of
human
effort
which
is
going
on
will
be
realized
in
one
foreign
city
the
bricklayers
union
have
restricted
their
men
to
bricks
per
day
on
work
of
this
character
when
working
for
the
city
and
per
day
when
working
for
private
owners
the
members
of
this
union
are
probably
sincere
in
their
belief
that
this
restriction
of
output
is
a
benefit
to
their
trade
it
should
be
plain
to
all
men
however
that
this
deliberate
loafing
is
almost
criminal
in
that
it
inevitably
results
in
making
every
workman
family
pay
higher
rent
for
their
housing
and
also
in
the
end
drives
work
and
trade
away
from
their
city
instead
of
bringing
it
to
it
why
is
it
in
a
trade
which
has
been
continually
practiced
since
before
the
christian
era
and
with
implements
practically
the
same
as
they
now
are
that
this
simplification
of
the
bricklayer
movements
this
great
gain
has
not
been
made
before
it
is
highly
likely
that
many
times
during
all
of
these
years
individual
bricklayers
have
recognized
the
possibility
of
eliminating
each
of
these
unnecessary
motions
but
even
if
in
the
past
he
did
invent
each
one
of
gilbreth
improvements
no
bricklayer
could
alone
increase
his
speed
through
their
adoption
because
it
will
be
remembered
that
in
all
cases
several
bricklayers
work
together
in
a
row
and
that
the
walls
all
around
a
building
must
grow
at
the
same
rate
of
speed
no
one
bricklayer
then
can
work
much
faster
than
the
one
next
to
him
nor
has
any
one
workman
the
authority
to
make
other
men
cooperate
with
him
to
do
faster
work
it
is
only
through
enforced
standardization
of
methods
enforced
adoption
of
the
best
implements
and
working
conditions
and
enforced
cooperation
that
this
faster
work
can
be
assured
and
the
duty
of
enforcing
the
adoption
of
standards
and
of
cooperation
rests
with
the
management
alone
the
management
must
supply
continually
one
or
more
teachers
to
show
each
new
man
the
new
and
simpler
motions
and
the
slower
men
must
be
constantly
watched
and
helped
until
they
have
risen
to
their
proper
speed
all
of
those
who
after
proper
teaching
either
will
not
or
can
not
work
in
accordance
with
the
new
methods
and
at
the
higher
speed
must
be
discharged
by
the
management
the
management
must
also
recognize
the
broad
fact
that
workmen
will
not
submit
to
this
more
rigid
standardization
and
will
not
work
extra
hard
unless
they
receive
extra
pay
for
doing
it
all
of
this
involves
an
individual
study
of
and
treatment
for
each
man
while
in
the
past
they
have
been
handled
in
large
groups
the
management
must
also
see
that
those
who
prepare
the
bricks
and
the
mortar
and
adjust
the
scaffold
for
the
bricklayers
cooperate
with
them
by
doing
their
work
just
right
and
always
on
time
and
they
must
also
inform
each
bricklayer
at
frequent
intervals
as
to
the
progress
he
is
making
so
that
he
may
not
unintentionally
fall
off
in
his
pace
thus
it
will
be
seen
that
it
is
the
assumption
by
the
management
of
new
duties
and
new
kinds
of
work
never
done
by
employers
in
the
past
that
makes
this
great
improvement
possible
and
that
without
this
new
help
from
the
management
the
workman
even
with
full
knowledge
of
the
new
methods
and
with
the
best
of
intentions
could
not
attain
these
startling
results
gilbreth
method
of
bricklaying
furnishes
a
simple
illustration
of
true
and
effective
cooperation
not
the
type
of
cooperation
in
which
a
mass
of
workmen
on
one
side
together
cooperate
with
the
management
but
that
in
which
several
men
in
the
management
each
one
in
his
own
particular
way
help
each
workman
individually
on
the
one
hand
by
studying
his
needs
and
his
shortcomings
and
teaching
him
better
and
quicker
methods
and
on
the
other
hand
by
seeing
that
all
other
workmen
with
whom
he
comes
in
contact
help
and
cooperate
with
him
by
doing
their
part
of
the
work
right
and
fast
the
writer
has
gone
thus
fully
into
gilbreth
method
in
order
that
it
may
be
perfectly
clear
that
this
increase
in
output
and
that
this
harmony
could
not
have
been
attained
under
the
management
of
initiative
and
incentive
that
is
by
putting
the
problem
up
to
the
workman
and
leaving
him
to
solve
it
alone
which
has
been
the
philosophy
of
the
past
and
that
his
success
has
been
due
to
the
use
of
the
four
elements
which
constitute
the
essence
of
scientific
management
first
the
development
by
the
management
not
the
workman
of
the
science
of
bricklaying
with
rigid
rules
for
each
motion
of
every
man
and
the
perfection
and
standardization
of
all
implements
and
working
conditions
second
the
careful
selection
and
subsequent
training
of
the
bricklayers
into
men
and
the
elimination
of
all
men
who
refuse
to
or
are
unable
to
adopt
the
best
methods
third
bringing
the
bricklayer
and
the
science
of
bricklaying
together
through
the
constant
help
and
watchfulness
of
the
management
and
through
paying
each
man
a
large
daily
bonus
for
working
fast
and
doing
what
he
is
told
to
do
fourth
an
almost
equal
division
of
the
work
and
responsibility
between
the
workman
and
the
management
all
day
long
the
management
work
almost
side
by
side
with
the
men
helping
encouraging
and
smoothing
the
way
for
them
while
in
the
past
they
stood
one
side
gave
the
men
but
little
help
and
threw
on
to
them
almost
the
entire
responsibility
as
to
methods
implements
speed
and
harmonious
cooperation
of
these
four
elements
the
first
the
development
of
the
science
of
bricklaying
is
the
most
interesting
and
spectacular
each
of
the
three
others
is
however
quite
as
necessary
for
success
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
back
of
all
this
and
directing
it
there
must
be
the
optimistic
determined
and
leader
who
can
wait
patiently
as
well
as
work
in
most
cases
particularly
when
the
work
to
be
done
is
intricate
in
its
nature
the
development
of
the
science
is
the
most
important
of
the
four
great
elements
of
the
new
management
there
are
instances
however
in
which
the
scientific
selection
of
the
workman
counts
for
more
than
anything
else
a
case
of
this
type
is
well
illustrated
in
the
very
simple
though
unusual
work
of
inspecting
bicycle
balls
when
the
bicycle
craze
was
at
its
height
some
years
ago
several
million
small
balls
made
of
hardened
steel
were
used
annually
in
bicycle
bearings
and
among
the
twenty
or
more
operations
used
in
making
steel
balls
perhaps
the
most
important
was
that
of
inspecting
them
after
final
polishing
so
as
to
remove
all
or
otherwise
imperfect
balls
before
boxing
the
writer
was
given
the
task
of
systematizing
the
largest
bicycle
ball
factory
in
this
country
this
company
had
been
running
for
from
eight
to
ten
years
on
ordinary
day
work
before
he
undertook
its
reorganization
so
that
the
one
hundred
and
twenty
or
more
girls
who
were
inspecting
the
balls
were
old
bands
and
skilled
at
their
jobs
it
is
impossible
even
in
the
most
elementary
work
to
change
rapidly
from
the
old
independence
of
individual
day
work
to
scientific
cooperation
in
most
cases
however
there
exist
certain
imperfections
in
working
conditions
which
can
at
once
be
improved
with
benefit
to
all
concerned
in
this
instance
it
was
found
that
the
inspectors
girls
were
working
ten
and
hours
per
day
with
a
saturday
half
holiday
their
work
consisted
briefly
in
placing
a
row
of
small
polished
steel
balls
on
the
back
of
the
left
hand
in
the
crease
between
two
of
the
fingers
pressed
together
and
while
they
were
rolled
over
and
over
they
were
minutely
examined
in
a
strong
light
and
with
the
aid
of
a
magnet
held
in
the
right
hand
the
defective
balls
were
picked
out
and
thrown
into
especial
boxes
four
kinds
of
defects
were
looked
soft
scratched
and
and
they
were
mostly
so
minute
as
to
be
invisible
to
an
eye
not
especially
trained
to
this
work
it
required
the
closest
attention
and
concentration
so
that
the
nervous
tension
of
the
inspectors
was
considerable
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
they
were
comfortably
seated
and
were
not
physically
tired
a
most
casual
study
made
it
evident
that
a
very
considerable
part
of
the
ten
and
hours
during
which
the
girls
were
supposed
to
work
was
really
spent
in
idleness
because
the
working
period
was
too
long
it
is
a
matter
of
ordinary
common
sense
to
plan
working
hours
so
that
the
workers
can
really
work
while
they
work
and
play
while
they
play
and
not
mix
the
two
before
the
arrival
of
sanford
thompson
who
undertook
a
scientific
study
of
the
whole
process
we
decided
therefore
to
shorten
the
working
hours
the
old
foreman
who
had
been
over
the
inspecting
room
for
years
was
instructed
to
interview
one
after
another
of
the
better
inspectors
and
the
more
influential
girls
and
persuade
them
that
they
could
do
just
as
much
work
in
ten
hours
each
day
as
they
had
been
doing
in
ten
and
hours
each
girl
was
told
that
the
proposition
was
to
shorten
the
day
work
to
ten
hours
and
pay
them
the
same
day
pay
they
were
receiving
for
the
ten
and
hours
in
about
two
weeks
the
foreman
reported
that
all
of
the
girls
he
had
talked
to
agreed
that
they
could
do
their
present
work
just
as
well
in
ten
hours
as
in
ten
and
and
that
they
approved
of
the
change
the
writer
had
not
been
especially
noted
for
his
tact
so
he
decided
that
it
would
be
wise
for
him
to
display
a
little
more
of
this
quality
by
having
the
girls
vote
on
the
new
proposition
this
decision
was
hardly
justified
however
for
when
the
vote
was
taken
the
girls
were
unanimous
that
hours
was
good
enough
for
them
and
they
wanted
no
innovation
of
any
kind
this
settled
the
matter
for
the
time
being
a
few
months
later
tact
was
thrown
to
the
winds
and
the
working
hours
were
arbitrarily
shortened
in
successive
steps
to
hours
and
the
pay
per
day
remaining
the
same
and
with
each
shortening
of
the
working
day
the
output
increased
instead
of
diminishing
the
change
from
the
old
to
the
scientific
method
in
this
department
was
made
under
the
direction
of
sanford
thompson
perhaps
the
most
experienced
man
in
motion
and
time
study
in
this
country
under
the
general
superintendence
of
gantt
in
the
physiological
departments
of
our
universities
experiments
are
regularly
conducted
to
determine
what
is
known
as
the
personal
coefficient
of
the
man
tested
this
is
done
by
suddenly
bringing
some
object
the
letter
a
or
b
for
instance
within
the
range
of
vision
of
the
subject
who
the
instant
he
recognizes
the
letter
has
to
do
some
definite
thing
such
as
to
press
a
particular
electric
button
the
time
which
elapses
from
the
instant
the
letter
comes
in
view
until
the
subject
presses
the
button
is
accurately
recorded
by
a
delicate
scientific
instrument
this
test
shows
conclusively
that
there
is
a
great
difference
in
the
personal
coefficient
of
different
men
some
individuals
are
born
with
unusually
quick
powers
of
perception
accompanied
by
quick
responsive
action
with
some
the
message
is
almost
instantly
transmitted
from
the
eye
to
the
brain
and
the
brain
equally
quickly
responds
by
sending
the
proper
message
to
the
hand
men
of
this
type
are
said
to
have
a
low
personal
coefficient
while
those
of
slow
perception
and
slow
action
have
a
high
personal
coefficient
thompson
soon
recognized
that
the
quality
most
needed
for
bicycle
ball
inspectors
was
a
low
personal
coefficient
of
course
the
ordinary
qualities
of
endurance
and
industry
were
also
called
for
for
the
ultimate
good
of
the
girls
as
well
as
the
company
however
it
became
necessary
to
exclude
all
girls
who
lacked
a
low
personal
coefficient
and
unfortunately
this
involved
laying
off
many
of
the
most
intelligent
hardest
working
and
most
trustworthy
girls
merely
because
they
did
not
possess
the
quality
of
quick
perception
followed
by
quick
action
while
the
gradual
selection
of
girls
was
going
on
other
changes
were
also
being
made
one
of
the
dangers
to
be
guarded
against
when
the
pay
of
the
man
or
woman
is
made
in
any
way
to
depend
on
the
quantity
of
the
work
done
is
that
in
the
effort
to
increase
the
quantity
the
quality
is
apt
to
deteriorate
it
is
necessary
in
almost
all
cases
therefore
to
take
definite
steps
to
insure
against
any
falling
off
in
quality
before
moving
in
any
way
towards
an
increase
in
quantity
in
the
work
of
these
particular
girls
quality
was
the
very
essence
they
were
engaged
in
picking
out
all
defective
balls
the
first
step
therefore
was
to
make
it
impossible
for
them
to
slight
their
work
without
being
found
out
this
was
accomplished
through
what
is
known
as
each
one
of
four
of
the
most
girls
was
given
each
day
a
lot
of
balls
to
inspect
which
had
been
examined
the
day
before
by
one
of
the
regular
inspectors
the
number
identifying
the
lot
to
be
having
been
changed
by
the
foreman
so
that
none
of
the
knew
whose
work
they
were
examining
in
addition
to
this
one
of
the
lots
inspected
by
the
four
was
examined
on
the
following
day
by
the
chief
inspector
selected
on
account
of
her
especial
accuracy
and
integrity
an
effective
expedient
was
adopted
for
checking
the
honesty
and
accuracy
of
the
every
two
or
three
days
a
lot
of
balls
was
especially
prepared
by
the
foreman
who
counted
out
a
definite
number
of
perfect
balls
and
added
a
recorded
number
of
defective
balls
of
each
kind
neither
the
inspectors
nor
the
had
any
means
of
distinguishing
this
prepared
lot
from
the
regular
commercial
lots
and
in
this
way
all
temptation
to
slight
their
work
or
make
false
returns
was
removed
after
insuring
in
this
way
against
deterioration
in
quality
effective
means
were
at
once
adopted
to
increase
the
output
improved
day
work
was
substituted
for
the
old
slipshod
method
an
accurate
daily
record
was
kept
both
as
to
the
quantity
and
quality
of
the
work
done
in
order
to
guard
against
any
personal
prejudice
on
the
part
of
the
foreman
and
to
insure
absolute
impartiality
and
justice
for
each
inspector
in
a
comparatively
short
time
this
record
enabled
the
foreman
to
stir
the
ambition
of
all
the
inspectors
by
increasing
the
wages
of
those
who
turned
out
a
large
quantity
and
good
quality
while
at
the
same
time
lowering
the
pay
of
those
who
did
indifferent
work
and
discharging
others
who
proved
to
be
incorrigibly
slow
or
careless
a
careful
examination
was
then
made
of
the
way
in
which
each
girl
spent
her
time
and
an
accurate
time
study
was
undertaken
through
the
use
of
a
and
record
blanks
to
determine
how
fast
each
kind
of
inspection
should
be
done
and
to
establish
the
exact
conditions
under
which
each
girl
could
do
her
quickest
and
best
work
while
at
the
same
time
guarding
against
giving
her
a
task
so
severe
that
there
was
danger
from
over
fatigue
or
exhaustion
this
investigation
showed
that
the
girls
spent
a
considerable
part
of
their
time
either
in
partial
idleness
talking
and
half
working
or
in
actually
doing
nothing
even
when
the
hours
of
labor
had
been
shortened
from
to
hours
a
close
observation
of
the
girls
showed
that
after
about
an
hour
and
of
consecutive
work
they
began
to
get
nervous
they
evidently
needed
a
rest
it
is
wise
to
stop
short
of
the
point
at
which
overstrain
begins
so
we
arranged
for
them
to
have
a
ten
minutes
period
for
recreation
at
the
end
of
each
hour
and
one
quarter
during
these
recess
periods
two
of
ten
minutes
each
in
the
morning
and
two
in
the
afternoon
they
were
obliged
to
stop
work
and
were
encouraged
to
leave
their
seats
and
get
a
complete
change
of
occupation
by
walking
around
and
talking
etc
in
one
respect
no
doubt
some
people
will
say
that
these
girls
were
brutally
treated
they
were
seated
so
far
apart
that
they
could
not
conveniently
talk
while
at
work
shortening
their
hours
of
labor
however
and
providing
so
far
as
we
knew
the
most
favorable
working
conditions
made
it
possible
for
them
to
really
work
steadily
instead
of
pretending
to
do
so
and
it
is
only
after
this
stage
in
the
reorganization
is
reached
when
the
girls
have
been
properly
selected
and
on
the
one
hand
such
precautions
have
been
taken
as
to
guard
against
the
possibility
of
them
while
on
the
other
hand
the
temptation
to
slight
their
work
has
been
removed
and
the
most
favorable
working
conditions
have
been
established
that
the
final
step
should
be
taken
which
insures
them
what
they
most
want
namely
high
wages
and
the
employers
what
they
most
want
namely
the
maximum
output
and
best
quality
of
work
means
a
low
labor
cost
this
step
is
to
give
each
girl
each
day
a
carefully
measured
task
which
demands
a
full
day
work
from
a
competent
operative
and
also
to
give
her
a
large
premium
or
bonus
whenever
she
accomplishes
this
task
this
was
done
in
this
case
through
establishing
what
is
known
as
differential
rate
piece
work
see
paper
read
before
the
american
society
of
mechanical
engineers
by
fred
taylor
vol
xvi
entitled
piece
rate
system
under
this
system
the
pay
of
each
girl
was
increased
in
proportion
to
the
quantity
of
her
output
and
also
still
more
in
proportion
to
the
accuracy
of
her
work
as
will
be
shown
later
the
differential
rate
the
lots
inspected
by
the
forming
the
basis
for
the
differential
resulted
in
a
large
gain
in
the
quantity
of
work
done
and
at
the
same
time
in
a
marked
improvement
in
the
quality
before
they
finally
worked
to
the
best
advantage
it
was
found
to
be
necessary
to
measure
the
output
of
each
girl
as
often
as
once
every
hour
and
to
send
a
teacher
to
each
individual
who
was
found
to
be
falling
behind
to
find
what
was
wrong
to
straighten
her
out
and
to
encourage
and
help
her
to
catch
up
there
is
a
general
principle
back
of
this
which
should
be
appreciated
by
all
of
those
who
are
especially
interested
in
the
management
of
men
a
reward
if
it
is
to
be
effective
in
stimulating
men
to
do
their
best
work
must
come
soon
after
the
work
has
been
done
but
few
men
are
able
to
look
forward
for
more
than
a
week
or
perhaps
at
most
a
month
and
work
hard
for
a
reward
which
they
are
to
receive
at
the
end
of
this
time
the
average
workman
must
be
able
to
measure
what
he
has
accomplished
and
clearly
see
his
reward
at
the
end
of
each
day
if
he
is
to
do
his
best
and
more
elementary
characters
such
as
the
young
girls
inspecting
bicycle
balls
or
children
for
instance
should
have
proper
encouragement
either
in
the
shape
of
personal
attention
from
those
over
them
or
an
actual
reward
in
sight
as
often
as
once
an
hour
this
is
one
of
the
principal
reasons
why
cooperation
or
either
through
selling
stock
to
the
employees
or
through
dividends
on
wages
received
at
the
end
of
the
year
have
been
at
the
best
only
mildly
effective
in
stimulating
men
to
work
hard
the
nice
time
which
they
are
sure
to
have
if
they
take
things
easily
and
go
slowly
proves
more
attractive
than
steady
hard
work
with
a
possible
reward
to
be
shared
with
others
six
months
later
a
second
reason
for
the
inefficiency
of
schemes
had
been
that
no
form
of
cooperation
has
yet
been
devised
in
which
each
individual
is
allowed
free
scope
for
his
personal
ambition
personal
ambition
always
has
been
and
will
remain
a
more
powerful
incentive
to
exertion
than
a
desire
for
the
general
welfare
the
few
misplaced
drones
who
do
the
loafing
and
share
equally
in
the
profits
with
the
rest
under
cooperation
are
sure
to
drag
the
better
men
down
toward
their
level
other
and
formidable
difficulties
in
the
path
of
cooperative
schemes
are
the
equitable
division
of
the
profits
and
the
fact
that
while
workmen
are
always
ready
to
share
the
profits
they
are
neither
able
nor
willing
to
share
the
losses
further
than
this
in
many
cases
it
is
neither
right
nor
just
that
they
should
share
either
the
profits
or
the
losses
since
these
may
be
due
in
great
part
to
causes
entirely
beyond
their
influence
or
control
and
to
which
they
do
not
contribute
to
come
back
to
the
girls
inspecting
bicycle
balls
however
the
final
outcome
of
all
the
changes
was
that
girls
did
the
work
formerly
done
by
one
hundred
and
twenty
and
that
the
accuracy
of
the
work
at
the
higher
speed
was
greater
than
at
the
former
slow
speed
the
good
that
came
to
the
girls
was
first
that
they
averaged
from
to
per
cent
higher
wages
than
they
formerly
received
second
their
hours
of
labor
were
shortened
from
to
per
day
with
a
saturday
half
holiday
and
they
were
given
four
recreation
periods
properly
distributed
through
the
day
which
made
overworking
impossible
for
a
healthy
girl
third
each
girl
was
made
to
feel
that
she
was
the
object
of
especial
care
and
interest
on
the
part
of
the
management
and
that
if
anything
went
wrong
with
her
she
could
always
have
a
helper
and
teacher
in
the
management
to
lean
upon
fourth
all
young
women
should
be
given
two
consecutive
days
of
rest
with
pay
each
month
to
be
taken
whenever
they
may
choose
it
is
my
impression
that
these
girls
were
given
this
privilege
although
i
am
not
quite
certain
on
this
point
the
benefits
which
came
to
the
company
from
these
changes
were
first
a
substantial
improvement
in
the
quality
of
the
product
second
a
material
reduction
in
the
cost
of
inspection
in
spite
of
the
extra
expense
involved
in
clerk
work
teachers
time
study
and
in
paying
higher
wages
third
that
the
most
friendly
relations
existed
between
the
management
and
the
employees
which
rendered
labor
troubles
of
any
kind
or
a
strike
impossible
these
good
results
were
brought
about
by
many
changes
which
substituted
favorable
for
unfavorable
working
conditions
it
should
be
appreciated
however
that
the
one
element
which
did
more
than
all
of
the
others
was
the
careful
selection
of
girls
with
quick
perception
to
replace
those
whose
perceptions
were
slow
the
substitution
of
girls
with
a
low
personal
coefficient
for
those
whose
personal
coefficient
was
high
the
scientific
selection
of
the
workers
the
illustrations
have
thus
far
been
purposely
confined
to
the
more
elementary
types
of
work
so
that
a
very
strong
doubt
must
still
remain
as
to
whether
this
kind
of
cooperation
is
desirable
in
the
case
of
more
intelligent
mechanics
that
is
in
the
case
of
men
who
are
more
capable
of
generalization
and
who
would
therefore
be
more
likely
of
their
own
volition
to
choose
the
more
scientific
and
better
methods
the
following
illustrations
will
be
given
for
the
purpose
of
demonstrating
the
fact
that
in
the
higher
classes
of
work
the
scientific
laws
which
are
developed
are
so
intricate
that
the
mechanic
needs
even
more
than
the
cheap
laborer
the
cooperation
of
men
better
educated
than
himself
in
finding
the
laws
and
then
in
selecting
developing
and
training
him
to
work
in
accordance
with
these
laws
these
illustrations
should
make
perfectly
clear
our
original
proposition
that
in
practically
all
of
the
mechanic
arts
the
science
which
underlies
each
workman
act
is
so
great
and
amounts
to
so
much
that
the
workman
who
is
best
suited
to
actually
doing
the
work
is
incapable
either
through
lack
of
education
or
through
insufficient
mental
capacity
of
understanding
this
science
a
doubt
for
instance
will
remain
in
the
minds
perhaps
of
most
readers
in
the
case
of
an
establishment
which
manufactures
the
same
machine
year
in
and
year
out
in
large
quantities
and
in
which
therefore
each
mechanic
repeats
the
same
limited
series
of
operations
over
and
over
again
whether
the
ingenuity
of
each
workman
and
the
help
which
he
from
time
to
time
receives
from
his
foreman
will
not
develop
such
superior
methods
and
such
a
personal
dexterity
that
no
scientific
study
which
could
be
made
would
result
in
a
material
increase
in
efficiency
a
number
of
years
ago
a
company
employing
about
three
hundred
men
which
had
been
manufacturing
the
same
machine
for
ten
to
fifteen
years
sent
for
us
to
report
as
to
whether
any
gain
could
be
made
through
the
introduction
of
scientific
management
their
shops
had
been
run
for
many
years
under
a
good
superintendent
and
with
excellent
foremen
and
workmen
on
piece
work
the
whole
establishment
was
without
doubt
in
better
physical
condition
than
the
average
in
this
country
the
superintendent
was
distinctly
displeased
when
told
that
through
the
adoption
of
task
management
the
output
with
the
same
number
of
men
and
machines
could
be
more
than
doubled
he
said
that
he
believed
that
any
such
statement
was
mere
boasting
absolutely
false
and
instead
of
inspiring
him
with
confidence
he
was
disgusted
that
any
one
should
make
such
an
impudent
claim
he
however
readily
assented
to
the
proposition
that
he
should
select
any
one
of
the
machines
whose
output
he
considered
as
representing
the
average
of
the
shop
and
that
we
should
then
demonstrate
on
this
machine
that
through
scientific
methods
its
output
could
be
more
than
doubled
the
machine
selected
by
him
fairly
represented
the
work
of
the
shop
it
had
been
run
for
ten
or
twelve
years
past
by
a
mechanic
who
was
more
than
equal
in
his
ability
to
the
average
workmen
in
the
establishment
in
a
shop
of
this
sort
in
which
similar
machines
are
made
over
and
over
again
the
work
is
necessarily
greatly
subdivided
so
that
no
one
man
works
upon
more
than
a
comparatively
small
number
of
parts
during
the
year
a
careful
record
was
therefore
made
in
the
presence
of
both
parties
of
the
time
actually
taken
in
finishing
each
of
the
parts
which
this
man
worked
upon
the
total
time
required
by
him
to
finish
each
piece
as
well
as
the
exact
speeds
and
feeds
which
he
took
were
noted
and
a
record
was
kept
of
the
time
which
he
took
in
setting
the
work
in
the
machine
and
removing
it
after
obtaining
in
this
way
a
statement
of
what
represented
a
fair
average
of
the
work
done
in
the
shop
we
applied
to
this
one
machine
the
principles
of
scientific
management
by
means
of
four
quite
elaborate
which
have
been
especially
made
for
the
purpose
of
determining
the
capacity
of
machines
a
careful
analysis
was
made
of
every
element
of
this
machine
in
its
relation
to
the
work
in
hand
its
pulling
power
at
its
various
speeds
its
feeding
capacity
and
its
proper
speeds
were
determined
by
means
of
the
and
changes
were
then
made
in
the
countershaft
and
driving
pulleys
so
as
to
run
it
at
its
proper
speed
tools
made
of
steel
and
of
the
proper
shapes
were
properly
dressed
treated
and
ground
it
should
be
understood
however
that
in
this
case
the
steel
which
had
heretofore
been
in
general
use
in
the
shop
was
also
used
in
our
demonstration
a
large
special
was
then
made
by
means
of
which
the
exact
speeds
and
feeds
were
indicated
at
which
each
kind
of
work
could
be
done
in
the
shortest
possible
time
in
this
particular
lathe
after
preparing
in
this
way
so
that
the
workman
should
work
according
to
the
new
method
one
after
another
pieces
of
work
were
finished
in
the
lathe
corresponding
to
the
work
which
had
been
done
in
our
preliminary
trials
and
the
gain
in
time
made
through
running
the
machine
according
to
scientific
principles
ranged
from
two
and
times
the
speed
in
the
slowest
instance
to
nine
times
the
speed
in
the
highest
the
change
from
management
to
scientific
management
involves
however
not
only
a
study
of
what
is
the
proper
speed
for
doing
the
work
and
a
remodeling
of
the
tools
and
the
implements
in
the
shop
but
also
a
complete
change
in
the
mental
attitude
of
all
the
men
in
the
shop
toward
their
work
and
toward
their
employers
the
physical
improvements
in
the
machines
necessary
to
insure
large
gains
and
the
motion
study
followed
by
minute
study
with
a
of
the
time
in
which
each
workman
should
do
his
work
can
be
made
comparatively
quickly
but
the
change
in
the
mental
attitude
and
in
the
habits
of
the
three
hundred
or
more
workmen
can
be
brought
about
only
slowly
and
through
a
long
series
of
which
finally
demonstrates
to
each
man
the
great
advantage
which
he
will
gain
by
heartily
cooperating
in
his
work
with
the
men
in
the
management
within
three
years
however
in
this
shop
the
output
had
been
more
than
doubled
per
man
and
per
machine
the
men
had
been
carefully
selected
and
in
almost
all
cases
promoted
from
a
lower
to
a
higher
order
of
work
and
so
instructed
by
their
teachers
the
functional
foremen
that
they
were
able
to
earn
higher
wages
than
ever
before
the
average
increase
in
the
daily
earnings
of
each
man
was
about
per
while
at
the
same
time
the
sum
total
of
the
wages
paid
for
doing
a
given
amount
of
work
was
lower
than
before
this
increase
in
the
speed
of
doing
the
work
of
course
involved
a
substitution
of
the
quickest
hand
methods
for
the
old
independent
methods
and
an
elaborate
analysis
of
the
hand
work
done
by
each
man
by
hand
work
is
meant
such
work
as
depends
upon
the
manual
dexterity
and
speed
of
a
workman
and
which
is
independent
of
the
work
done
by
the
machine
the
time
saved
by
scientific
hand
work
was
in
many
cases
greater
even
than
that
saved
in
it
seems
important
to
fully
explain
the
reason
why
with
the
aid
of
a
and
after
having
studied
the
art
of
cutting
metals
it
was
possible
for
the
scientifically
equipped
man
who
had
never
before
seen
these
particular
jobs
and
who
had
never
worked
on
this
machine
to
do
work
from
two
and
to
nine
times
as
fast
as
it
had
been
done
before
by
a
good
mechanic
who
had
spent
his
whole
time
for
some
ten
to
twelve
years
in
doing
this
very
work
upon
this
particular
machine
in
a
word
this
was
possible
because
the
art
of
cutting
metals
involves
a
true
science
of
no
small
magnitude
a
science
in
fact
so
intricate
that
it
is
impossible
for
any
machinist
who
is
suited
to
running
a
lathe
year
in
and
year
out
either
to
understand
it
or
to
work
according
to
its
laws
without
the
help
of
men
who
have
made
this
their
specialty
men
who
are
with
work
are
prone
to
look
upon
the
manufacture
of
each
piece
as
a
special
problem
independent
of
any
other
kind
of
they
are
apt
to
think
for
instance
that
the
problems
connected
with
making
the
parts
of
an
engine
require
the
especial
study
one
may
say
almost
the
life
study
of
a
set
of
mechanics
and
that
these
problems
are
entirely
different
from
those
which
would
be
met
with
in
machining
lathe
or
planer
parts
in
fact
however
a
study
of
those
elements
which
are
peculiar
either
to
engine
parts
or
to
lathe
parts
is
trifling
compared
with
the
great
study
of
the
art
or
science
of
cutting
metals
upon
a
knowledge
of
which
rests
the
ability
to
do
really
fast
of
all
kinds
the
real
problem
is
how
to
remove
chips
fast
from
a
casting
or
a
forging
and
how
to
make
the
piece
smooth
and
true
in
the
shortest
time
and
it
matters
but
little
whether
the
piece
being
worked
upon
is
part
say
of
a
marine
engine
a
or
an
automobile
for
this
reason
the
man
with
the
slide
rule
familiar
with
the
science
of
cutting
metals
who
had
never
before
seen
this
particular
work
was
able
completely
to
distance
the
skilled
mechanic
who
had
made
the
parts
of
this
machine
his
specialty
for
years
it
is
true
that
whenever
intelligent
and
educated
men
find
that
the
responsibility
for
making
progress
in
any
of
the
mechanic
arts
rests
with
them
instead
of
upon
the
workmen
who
are
actually
laboring
at
the
trade
that
they
almost
invariably
start
on
the
road
which
leads
to
the
development
of
a
science
where
in
the
past
has
existed
mere
traditional
or
knowledge
when
men
whose
education
has
given
them
the
habit
of
generalizing
and
everywhere
looking
for
laws
find
themselves
confronted
with
a
multitude
of
problems
such
as
exist
in
every
trade
and
which
have
a
general
similarity
one
to
another
it
is
inevitable
that
they
should
try
to
gather
these
problems
into
certain
logical
groups
and
then
search
for
some
general
laws
or
rules
to
guide
them
in
their
solution
as
has
been
pointed
out
however
the
underlying
principles
of
the
management
of
initiative
and
incentive
that
is
the
underlying
philosophy
of
this
management
necessarily
leaves
the
solution
of
all
of
these
problems
in
the
hands
of
each
individual
workman
while
the
philosophy
of
scientific
management
places
their
solution
in
the
hands
of
the
management
the
workman
whole
time
is
each
day
taken
in
actually
doing
the
work
with
his
hands
so
that
even
if
he
had
the
necessary
education
and
habits
of
generalizing
in
his
thought
he
lacks
the
time
and
the
opportunity
for
developing
these
laws
because
the
study
of
even
a
simple
law
involving
say
time
study
requires
the
cooperation
of
two
men
the
one
doing
the
work
while
the
other
times
him
with
a
and
even
if
the
workman
were
to
develop
laws
where
before
existed
only
knowledge
his
personal
interest
would
lead
him
almost
inevitably
to
keep
his
discoveries
secret
so
that
he
could
by
means
of
this
special
knowledge
personally
do
more
work
than
other
men
and
so
obtain
higher
wages
under
scientific
management
on
the
other
hand
it
becomes
the
duty
and
also
the
pleasure
of
those
who
are
engaged
in
the
management
not
only
to
develop
laws
to
replace
rule
of
thumb
but
also
to
teach
impartially
all
of
the
workmen
who
are
under
them
the
quickest
ways
of
working
the
useful
results
obtained
from
these
laws
are
always
so
great
that
any
company
can
well
afford
to
pay
for
the
time
and
the
experiments
needed
to
develop
them
thus
under
scientific
management
exact
scientific
knowledge
and
methods
are
everywhere
sooner
or
later
sure
to
replace
rule
of
thumb
whereas
under
the
old
type
of
management
working
in
accordance
with
scientific
laws
is
an
impossibility
the
development
of
the
art
or
science
of
cutting
metals
is
an
apt
illustration
of
this
fact
in
the
fall
of
about
the
time
that
the
writer
started
to
make
the
experiments
above
referred
to
to
determine
what
constitutes
a
proper
day
work
for
a
laborer
he
also
obtained
the
permission
of
william
sellers
the
president
of
the
midvale
steel
company
to
make
a
series
of
experiments
to
determine
what
angles
and
shapes
of
tools
were
the
best
for
cutting
steel
and
also
to
try
to
determine
the
proper
cutting
speed
for
steel
at
the
time
that
these
experiments
were
started
it
was
his
belief
that
they
would
not
last
longer
than
six
months
and
in
fact
if
it
had
been
known
that
a
longer
period
than
this
would
be
required
the
permission
to
spend
a
considerable
sum
of
money
in
making
them
would
not
have
been
forthcoming
a
diameter
vertical
was
the
first
machine
used
in
making
these
experiments
and
large
locomotive
tires
made
out
of
hard
steel
of
uniform
quality
were
day
after
day
cut
up
into
chips
in
gradually
learning
how
to
make
shape
and
use
the
cutting
tools
so
that
they
would
do
faster
work
at
the
end
of
six
months
sufficient
practical
information
had
been
obtained
to
far
more
than
repay
the
cost
of
materials
and
wages
which
had
been
expended
in
experimenting
and
yet
the
comparatively
small
number
of
experiments
which
had
been
made
served
principally
to
make
it
clear
that
the
actual
knowledge
attained
was
but
a
small
fraction
of
that
which
still
remained
to
be
developed
and
which
was
badly
needed
by
us
in
our
daily
attempt
to
direct
and
help
the
machinists
in
their
tasks
experiments
in
this
field
were
carried
on
with
occasional
interruption
through
a
period
of
about
years
in
the
course
of
which
ten
different
experimental
machines
were
especially
fitted
up
to
do
this
work
between
and
experiments
were
carefully
recorded
and
many
other
experiments
were
made
of
which
no
record
was
kept
in
studying
these
laws
more
than
pounds
of
steel
and
iron
was
cut
up
into
chips
with
the
experimental
tools
and
it
is
estimated
that
from
to
was
spent
in
the
investigation
work
of
this
character
is
intensely
interesting
to
any
one
who
has
any
love
for
scientific
research
for
the
purpose
of
this
paper
however
it
should
be
fully
appreciated
that
the
motive
power
which
kept
these
experiments
going
through
many
years
and
which
supplied
the
money
and
the
opportunity
for
their
accomplishment
was
not
an
abstract
search
after
scientific
knowledge
but
was
the
very
practical
fact
that
we
lacked
the
exact
information
which
was
needed
every
day
in
order
to
help
our
machinists
to
do
their
work
in
the
best
way
and
in
the
quickest
time
all
of
these
experiments
were
made
to
enable
us
to
answer
correctly
the
two
questions
which
face
every
machinist
each
time
that
he
does
a
piece
of
work
in
a
machine
such
as
a
lathe
planer
drill
press
or
milling
machine
these
two
questions
are
in
order
to
do
the
work
in
the
quickest
time
at
what
cutting
speed
shall
i
run
my
machine
and
what
feed
shall
i
use
they
sound
so
simple
that
they
would
appear
to
call
for
merely
the
trained
judgment
of
any
good
mechanic
in
fact
however
after
working
years
it
has
been
found
that
the
answer
in
every
case
involves
the
solution
of
an
intricate
mathematical
problem
in
which
the
effect
of
twelve
independent
variables
must
be
determined
each
of
the
twelve
following
variables
has
an
important
effect
upon
the
answer
the
figures
which
are
given
with
each
of
the
variables
represent
the
effect
of
this
element
upon
the
cutting
speed
for
example
after
the
first
variable
a
we
quote
the
proportion
is
as
i
in
the
case
of
steel
or
chilled
iron
to
in
the
case
of
a
very
soft
steel
the
meaning
of
this
quotation
is
that
soft
steel
can
be
cut
times
as
fast
as
the
hard
steel
or
chilled
iron
the
ratios
which
are
given
then
after
each
of
these
elements
indicate
the
wide
range
of
judgment
which
practically
every
machinist
has
been
called
upon
to
exercise
in
the
past
in
determining
the
best
speed

which
to
run

machine

may
seem
preposterous
to
many
people
that

should
have
required
a
period
of
years
to
investigate
the
effect
of
these
twelve
variables
upon
the
cutting
speed
of
metals
to
those
however
who
have
had
personal
experience
as
experimenters
it
will
be
appreciated
that
the
great
difficulty
of
the
problem
lies
in
the
fact
that
it
contains
so
many
variable
elements
and
in
fact
the
great
length
of
time
consumed
in
making
each
single
experiment
was
caused
by
the
difficulty
of
holding
eleven
variables
constant
and
uniform
throughout
the
experiment
while
the
effect
of
the
twelfth
variable
was
being
investigated
holding
the
eleven
variables
constant
was
far
more
difficult
than
the
investigation
of
the
twelfth
element
as
one
after
another
the
effect
upon
the
cutting
speed
of
each
of
these
variables
was
investigated
in
order
that
practical
use
could
be
made
of
this
knowledge
it
was
necessary
to
find
a
mathematical
formula
which
expressed
in
concise
form
the
laws
which
had
been
obtained
as
examples
of

twelve

were
developed
the
three

after
these
laws
had
been
investigated
and
the
various
formulae

expressed

had
been
determined
there
still
remained
the
difficult
task
of
how
to
solve
one
of
these
complicated
mathematical
problems
quickly
enough
to
make
this
knowledge
available
for
use
if
a
good
mathematician
who
had
these
formula
before
him
were
to
attempt
to
get
the
proper
answer
to
get
the
correct
cutting
speed
and
feed
by
working
in
the
ordinary
way
it
would
take
him
from
two
to
six
hours
say
to
solve
a
single
problem
far
longer
to
solve
the
mathematical
problem
than
would
be
taken
in
most
cases
by
the
workmen
in
doing
the
whole
job
in
his
machine
thus
a
task
of
considerable
magnitude
which
faced
us
was
that
of
finding
a
quick
solution
of
this
problem
and
as
we
made
progress
in
its
solution
the
whole
problem
was
from
time
to
time
presented
by
the
writer
to
one
after
another
of
the
noted
mathematicians
in
this
country
they
were
offered
any
reasonable
fee
for
a
rapid
practical
method
to
be
used
in
its
solution
some
of
these
men
merely
glanced
at
it
others
for
the
sake
of
being
courteous
kept
it
before
them
for
some
two
or
three
weeks
they
all
gave
us
practically
the
same
answer
that
in
many
cases
it
was
possible
to
solve
mathematical
problems
which
contained
four
variables
and
in
some
cases
problems
with
five
or
six
variables
but
that
it
was
manifestly
impossible
to
solve
a
problem
containing
twelve
variables
in
any
other
way
than
by
the
slow
process
of
trial
and
error
a
quick
solution
was
however
so
much
of
a
necessity
in
our
work
of
running
that
in
spite
of
the
small
encouragement
received
from
the
mathematicians
we
continued
at
irregular
periods
through
a
term
of
fifteen
years
to
give
a
large
amount
of
time
searching
for
a
simple
solution
four
or
five
men
at
various
periods
gave
practically
their
whole
time
to
this
work
and
finally
while
we
were
at
the
bethlehem
steel
company
the
was
developed
which
is
illustrated
on
folder
no
of
the
paper
on
the
art
of
cutting
metals
and
is
described
in
detail
in
the
paper
presented
by
carl
barth
to
the
american
society
of
mechanical
engineers
entitled
for
the
as
a
part
of
the
taylor
system
of
management
vol
xxv
of
the
transactions
of
the
american
society
of
mechanical
engineers
by
means
of
this
one
of
these
intricate
problems
can
be
solved
in
less
than
a
half
minute
by
any
good
mechanics
whether
he
understands
anything
about
mathematics
or
not
thus
making
available
for
practical
use
the
years
of
experimenting
on
the
art
of
cutting
metals
this
is
a
good
illustration
of
the
fact
that
some
way
can
always
be
found
of
making
practical
everyday
use
of
complicated
scientific
data
which
appears
to
be
beyond
the
experience
and
the
range
of
the
technical
training
of
ordinary
practical
men
these
have
been
for
years
in
constant
daily
use
by
machinists
having
no
knowledge
of
mathematics
a
glance
at
the
intricate
mathematical
formula
see
page
which
represent
the
laws
of
cutting
metals
should
clearly
show
the
reason
why
it
is
impossible
for
any
machinist
without
the
aid
of
these
laws
and
who
depends
upon
his
personal
experience
correctly
to
guess
at
the
answer
to
the
two
questions
what
speed
shall
i
use
what
feed
shall
i
use
even
though
he
may
repeat
the
same
piece
of
work
many
times
to
return
to
the
case
of
the
machinist
who
had
been
working
for
ten
to
twelve
years
in
machining
the
same
pieces
over
and
over
again
there
was
but
a
remote
chance
in
any
of
the
various
kinds
of
work
which
this
man
did
that
he
should
hit
upon
the
one
best
method
of
doing
each
piece
of
work
out
of
the
hundreds
of
possible
methods
which
lay
before
him
in
considering
this
typical
case
it
must
also
be
remembered
that
the
machines
throughout
our
have
practically
all
been
speeded
by
their
makers
by
guesswork
and
without
the
knowledge
obtained
through
a
study
of
the
art
of
cutting
metals
in
the
systematized
by
us
we
have
found
that
there
is
not
one
machine
in
a
hundred
which
is
speeded
by
its
makers
at
anywhere
near
the
correct
cutting
speed
so
that
in
order
to
compete
with
the
science
of
cutting
metals
the
machinist
before
he
could
use
proper
speeds
would
first
have
to
put
new
pulleys
on
the
countershaft
of
his
machine
and
also
make
in
most
cases
changes
in
the
shapes
and
treatment
of
his
tools
etc
many
of
these
changes
are
matters
entirely
beyond
his
control
even
if
he
knows
what
ought
to
be
done
if
the
reason
is
clear
to
the
reader
why
the
knowledge
obtained
by
the
machinist
who
is
engaged
on
repeat
work
can
not
possibly
compete
with
the
true
science
of
cutting
metals
it
should
be
even
more
apparent
why
the
mechanic
who
is
called
upon
to
do
a
great
variety
of
work
from
day
to
day
is
even
less
able
to
compete
with
this
science
the
mechanic
who
does
a
different
kind
of
work
each
day
in
order
to
do
each
job
in
the
quickest
time
would
need
in
addition
to
a
thorough
knowledge
of
the
art
of
cutting
metals
a
vast
knowledge
and
experience
in
the
quickest
way
of
doing
each
kind
of
hand
work
and
the
reader
by
calling
to
mind
the
gain
which
was
made
by
gilbreth
through
his
motion
and
time
study
in
laying
bricks
will
appreciate
the
great
possibilities
for
quicker
methods
of
doing
all
kinds
of
hand
work
which
lie
before
every
tradesman
after
he
has
the
help
which
comes
from
a
scientific
motion
and
time
study
of
his
work
for
nearly
thirty
years
past
men
connected
with
the
management
of
have
been
devoting
their
whole
time
to
a
scientific
motion
study
followed
by
accurate
time
study
with
a
of
all
of
the
elements
connected
with
the
machinist
work
when
therefore
the
teachers
who
form
one
section
of
the
management
and
who
are
cooperating
with
the
working
men
are
in
possession
both
of
the
science
of
cutting
metals
and
of
the
equally
elaborate
and
science
connected
with
this
work
it
is
not
difficult
to
appreciate
why
even
the
highest
class
mechanic
is
unable
to
do
his
best
work
without
constant
daily
assistance
from
his
teachers
and
if
this
fact
has
been
made
clear
to
the
reader
one
of
the
important
objects
in
writing
this
paper
will
have
been
realized
it
is
hoped
that
the
illustrations
which
have
been
given
make
it
apparent
why
scientific
management
must
inevitably
in
all
cases
produce
overwhelmingly
greater
results
both
for
the
company
and
its
employees
than
can
be
obtained
with
the
management
of
initiative
and
incentive
and
it
should
also
be
clear
that
these
results
have
been
attained
not
through
a
marked
superiority
in
the
mechanism
of
one
type
of
management
over
the
mechanism
of
another
but
rather
through
the
substitution
of
one
set
of
underlying
principles
for
a
totally
different
set
of
principles
by
the
substitution
of
one
philosophy
for
another
philosophy
in
industrial
management
to
repeat
them
throughout
all
of
these
illustrations
it
will
be
seen
that
the
useful
results
have
hinged
mainly
upon
the
substitution
of
a
science
for
the
individual
judgment
of
the
workman
the
scientific
selection
and
development
of
the
workman
after
each
man
has
been
studied
taught
and
trained
and
one
may
say
experimented
with
instead
of
allowing
the
workmen
to
select
themselves
and
develop
in
a
haphazard
way
and
the
intimate
cooperation
of
the
management
with
the
workmen
so
that
they
together
do
the
work
in
accordance
with
the
scientific
laws
which
have
been
developed
instead
of
leaving
the
solution
of
each
problem
in
the
hands
of
the
individual
workman
in
applying
these
new
principles
in
place
of
the
old
individual
effort
of
each
workman
both
sides
share
almost
equally
in
the
daily
performance
of
each
task
the
management
doing
that
part
of
the
work
for
which
they
are
best
fitted
and
the
workmen
the
balance
it
is
for
the
illustration
of
this
philosophy
that
this
paper
has
been
written
but
some
of
the
elements
involved
in
its
general
principles
should
be
further
discussed
the
development
of
a
science
sounds
like
a
formidable
undertaking
and
in
fact
anything
like
a
thorough
study
of
a
science
such
as
that
of
cutting
metals
necessarily
involves
many
years
of
work
the
science
of
cutting
metals
however
represents
in
its
complication
and
in
the
time
required
to
develop
it
almost
an
extreme
case
in
the
mechanic
arts
yet
even
in
this
very
intricate
science
within
a
few
months
after
starting
enough
knowledge
had
been
obtained
to
much
more
than
pay
for
the
work
of
experimenting
this
holds
true
in
the
case
of
practically
all
scientific
development
in
the
mechanic
arts
the
first
laws
developed
for
cutting
metals
were
crude
and
contained
only
a
partial
knowledge
of
the
truth
yet
this
imperfect
knowledge
was
vastly
better
than
the
utter
lack
of
exact
information
or
the
very
imperfect
rule
of
thumb
which
existed
before
and
it
enabled
the
workmen
with
the
help
of
the
management
to
do
far
quicker
and
better
work
for
example
a
very
short
time
was
needed
to
discover
one
or
two
types
of
tools
which
though
imperfect
as
compared
with
the
shapes
developed
years
afterward
were
superior
to
all
other
shapes
and
kinds
in
common
use
these
tools
were
adopted
as
standard
and
made
possible
an
immediate
increase
in
the
speed
of
every
machinist
who
used
them
these
types
were
superseded
in
a
comparatively
short
time
by
still
other
tools
which
remained
standard
until
they
in
their
turn
made
way
for
later
improvements
time
and
again
the
experimenter
in
the
mechanic
arts
will
find
himself
face
to
face
with
the
problem
as
to
whether
he
had
better
make
immediate
practical
use
of
the
knowledge
which
he
has
attained
or
wait
until
some
positive
finality
in
his
conclusions
has
been
reached
he
recognizes
clearly
the
fact
that
he
has
already
made
some
definite
progress
but
sees
the
possibility
even
the
probability
of
still
further
improvement
each
particular
case
must
of
course
be
independently
considered
but
the
general
conclusion
we
have
reached
is
that
in
most
instances
it
is
wise
to
put
one
conclusions
as
soon
as
possible
to
the
rigid
test
of
practical
use
the
one
indispensable
condition
for
such
a
test
however
is
that
the
experimenter
shall
have
full
opportunity
coupled
with
sufficient
authority
to
insure
a
thorough
and
impartial
trial
and
this
owing
to
the
almost
universal
prejudice
in
favor
of
the
old
and
to
the
suspicion
of
the
new
is
difficult
to
get
the
science
which
exists
in
most
of
the
mechanic
arts
is
however
far
simpler
than
the
science
of
cutting
metals
in
almost
all
cases
in
fact
the
laws
or
rules
which
are
developed
are
so
simple
that
the
average
man
would
hardly
dignify
them
with
the
name
of
a
science
in
most
trades
the
science
is
developed
through
a
comparatively
simple
analysis
and
time
study
of
the
movements
required
by
the
workmen
to
do
some
small
part
of
his
work
and
this
study
is
usually
made
by
a
man
equipped
merely
with
a
and
a
properly
ruled
notebook
hundreds
of
these
men
are
now
engaged
in
developing
elementary
scientific
knowledge
where
before
existed
only
rule
of
thumb
even
the
motion
study
of
gilbreth
in
bricklaying
described
on
pages
to
involves
a
much
more
elaborate
investigation
than
that
which
occurs
in
most
cases
the
general
steps
to
be
taken
in
developing
a
simple
law
of
this
class
are
as
follows
first
find
say
or
different
men
preferably
in
as
many
separate
establishments
and
different
parts
of
the
country
who
are
especially
skilful
in
doing
the
particular
work
to
be
analyzed
second
study
the
exact
series
of
elementary
operations
or
motions
which
each
of
these
men
uses
in
doing
the
work
which
is
being
investigated
as
well
as
the
implements
each
man
uses
third
study
with
a
the
time
required
to
make
each
of
these
elementary
movements
and
then
select
the
quickest
way
of
doing
each
element
of
the
work
fourth
eliminate
all
false
movements
slow
movements
and
useless
movements
fifth
after
doing
away
with
all
unnecessary
movements
collect
into
one
series
the
quickest
and
best
movements
as
well
as
the
best
implements
this
one
new
method
involving
that
series
of
motions
which
can
be
made
quickest
and
best
is
then
substituted
in
place
of
the
ten
or
fifteen
inferior
series
which
were
formerly
in
use
this
best
method
becomes
standard
and
remains
standard
to
be
taught
first
to
the
teachers
or
functional
foremen
and
by
them
to
every
workman
in
the
establishment
until
it
is
superseded
by
a
quicker
and
better
series
of
movements
in
this
simple
way
one
element
after
another
of
the
science
is
developed
in
the
same
way
each
type
of
implement
used
in
a
trade
is
studied
under
the
philosophy
of
the
management
of
initiative
and
incentive
each
is
called
upon
to
use
his
own
best
judgment
so
as
to
do
the
work
in
the
quickest
time
and
from
this
results
in
all
cases
a
large
variety
in
the
shapes
and
types
of
implements
which
are
used
for
any
specific
purpose
scientific
management
requires
first
a
careful
investigation
of
each
of
the
many
modifications
of
the
same
implement
developed
under
rule
of
thumb
and
second
after
a
time
study
has
been
made
of
the
speed
attainable
with
each
of
these
implements
that
the
good
points
of
several
of
them
shall
be
united
in
a
single
standard
implement
which
will
enable
the
workman
to
work
faster
and
with
greater
ease
than
he
could
before
this
one
implement
then
is
adopted
as
standard
in
place
of
the
many
different
kinds
before
in
use
and
it
remains
standard
for
all
workmen
to
use
until
superseded
by
an
implement
which
has
been
shown
through
motion
and
time
study
to
be
still
better
with
this
explanation
it
will
be
seen
that
the
development
of
a
science
to
replace
rule
of
thumb
is
in
most
cases
by
no
means
a
formidable
and
that
it
can
be
accomplished
by
ordinary
men
without
any
elaborate
scientific
training
but
that
on
the
other
hand
the
successful
use
of
even
the
simplest
improvement
of
this
kind
calls
for
records
system
and
cooperation
where
in
the
past
existed
only
individual
effort
there
is
another
type
of
scientific
investigation
which
has
been
referred
to
several
times
in
this
paper
and
which
should
receive
special
attention
namely
the
accurate
study
of
the
motives
which
influence
men
at
first
it
may
appear
that
this
is
a
matter
for
individual
observation
and
judgment
and
is
not
a
proper
subject
for
exact
scientific
experiments
it
is
true
that
the
laws
which
result
from
experiments
of
this
class
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
very
complex
organism
the
human
being
is
being
experimented
with
are
subject
to
a
larger
number
of
exceptions
than
is
the
case
with
laws
relating
to
material
things
and
yet
laws
of
this
kind
which
apply
to
a
large
majority
of
men
unquestionably
exist
and
when
clearly
defined
are
of
great
value
as
a
guide
in
dealing
with
men
in
developing
these
laws
accurate
carefully
planned
and
executed
experiments
extending
through
a
term
of
years
have
been
made
similar
in
a
general
way
to
the
experiments
upon
various
other
elements
which
have
been
referred
to
in
this
paper
perhaps
the
most
important
law
belonging
to
this
class
in
its
relation
to
scientific
management
is
the
effect
which
the
task
idea
has
upon
the
efficiency
of
the
workman
this
in
fact
has
become
such
an
important
element
of
the
mechanism
of
scientific
management
that
by
a
great
number
of
people
scientific
management
has
come
to
be
known
as
task
management
there
is
absolutely
nothing
new
in
the
task
idea
each
one
of
us
will
remember
that
in
his
own
case
this
idea
was
applied
with
good
results
in
his
days
no
efficient
teacher
would
think
of
giving
a
class
of
students
an
indefinite
lesson
to
learn
each
day
a
definite
task
is
set
by
the
teacher
before
each
scholar
stating
that
he
must
learn
just
so
much
of
the
subject
and
it
is
only
by
this
means
that
proper
systematic
progress
can
be
made
by
the
students
the
average
boy
would
go
very
slowly
if
instead
of
being
given
a
task
he
were
told
to
do
as
much
as
he
could
all
of
us
are
children
and
it
is
equally
true
that
the
average
workman
will
work
with
the
greatest
satisfaction
both
to
himself
and
to
his
employer
when
he
is
given
each
day
a
definite
task
which
he
is
to
perform
in
a
given
time
and
which
constitutes
a
proper
day
work
for
a
good
workman
this
furnishes
the
workman
with
a
standard
by
which
he
can
throughout
the
day
measure
his
own
progress
and
the
accomplishment
of
which
affords
him
the
greatest
satisfaction
the
writer
has
described
in
other
papers
a
series
of
experiments
made
upon
workmen
which
have
resulted
in
demonstrating
the
fact
that
it
is
impossible
through
any
long
period
of
time
to
get
to
work
much
harder
than
the
average
men
around
them
unless
they
are
assured
a
large
and
a
permanent
increase
in
their
pay
this
series
of
experiments
however
also
proved
that
plenty
of
workmen
can
be
found
who
are
willing
to
work
at
their
best
speed
provided
they
are
given
this
liberal
increase
in
wages
the
workman
must
however
be
fully
assured
that
this
increase
beyond
the
average
is
to
be
permanent
our
experiments
have
shown
that
the
exact
percentage
of
increase
required
to
make
a
workman
work
at
his
highest
speed
depends
upon
the
kind
of
work
which
the
man
is
doing
it
is
absolutely
necessary
then
when
workmen
are
daily
given
a
task
which
calls
for
a
high
rate
of
speed
on
their
part
that
they
should
also
be
insured
the
necessary
high
rate
of
pay
whenever
they
are
successful
this
involves
not
only
fixing
for
each
man
his
daily
task
but
also
paying
him
a
large
bonus
or
premium
each
time
that
he
succeeds
in
doing
his
task
in
the
given
time
it
is
difficult
to
appreciate
in
full
measure
the
help
which
the
proper
use
of
these
two
elements
is
to
the
workman
in
elevating
him
to
the
highest
standard
of
efficiency
and
speed
in
his
trade
and
then
keeping
him
there
unless
one
has
seen
first
the
old
plan
and
afterward
the
new
tried
upon
the
same
man
and
in
fact
until
one
has
seen
similar
accurate
experiments
made
upon
various
grades
of
workmen
engaged
in
doing
widely
different
types
of
work
the
remarkable
and
almost
uniformly
good
results
from
the
correct
application
of
the
task
and
the
bonus
must
be
seen
to
be
appreciated
these
two
elements
the
task
and
the
bonus
which
as
has
been
pointed
out
in
previous
papers
can
be
applied
in
several
ways
constitute
two
of
the
most
important
elements
of
the
mechanism
of
scientific
management
they
are
especially
important
from
the
fact
that
they
are
as
it
were
a
climax
demanding
before
they
can
be
used
almost
all
of
the
other
elements
of
the
mechanism
such
as
a
planning
department
accurate
time
study
standardization
of
methods
and
implements
a
routing
system
the
training
of
functional
foremen
or
teachers
and
in
many
cases
instruction
cards
etc
referred
to
later
in
rather
more
detail
on
page
the
necessity
for
systematically
teaching
workmen
how
to
work
to
the
best
advantage
has
been
several
times
referred
to
it
seems
desirable
therefore
to
explain
in
rather
more
detail
how
this
teaching
is
done
in
the
case
of
a
which
is
managed
under
the
modern
system
detailed
written
instructions
as
to
the
best
way
of
doing
each
piece
of
work
are
prepared
in
advance
by
men
in
the
planning
department
these
instructions
represent
the
combined
work
of
several
men
in
the
planning
room
each
of
whom
has
his
own
specialty
or
function
one
of
them
for
instance
is
a
specialist
on
the
proper
speeds
and
cutting
tools
to
be
used
he
uses
the
which
have
been
above
described
as
an
aid
to
guide
him
in
obtaining
proper
speeds
etc
another
man
analyzes
the
best
and
quickest
motions
to
be
made
by
the
workman
in
setting
the
work
up
in
the
machine
and
removing
it
etc
still
a
third
through
the
records
which
have
been
accumulated
makes
out
a
timetable
giving
the
proper
speed
for
doing
each
element
of
the
work
the
directions
of
all
of
these
men
however
are
written
on
a
single
instruction
card
or
sheet
these
men
of
necessity
spend
most
of
their
time
in
the
planning
department
because
they
must
be
close
to
the
records
and
data
which
they
continually
use
in
their
work
and
because
this
work
requires
the
use
of
a
desk
and
freedom
from
interruption
human
nature
is
such
however
that
many
of
the
workmen
if
left
to
themselves
would
pay
but
little
attention
to
their
written
instructions
it
is
necessary
therefore
to
provide
teachers
called
functional
foremen
to
see
that
the
workmen
both
understand
and
carry
out
these
written
instructions
under
functional
management
the
single
foreman
is
superseded
by
eight
different
men
each
one
of
whom
has
his
own
special
duties
and
these
men
acting
as
the
agents
for
the
planning
department
see
paragraph
to
of
the
paper
entitled
shop
management
are
the
expert
teachers
who
are
at
all
times
in
the
shop
helping
and
directing
the
workmen
being
each
one
chosen
for
his
knowledge
and
personal
skill
in
his
specialty
they
are
able
not
only
to
tell
the
workman
what
he
should
do
but
in
case
of
necessity
they
do
the
work
themselves
in
the
presence
of
the
workman
so
as
to
show
him
not
only
the
best
but
also
the
quickest
methods
one
of
these
teachers
called
the
inspector
sees
to
it
that
he
understands
the
drawings
and
instructions
for
doing
the
work
he
teaches
him
how
to
do
work
of
the
right
quality
how
to
make
it
fine
and
exact
where
it
should
be
fine
and
rough
and
quick
where
accuracy
is
not
required
the
one
being
just
as
important
for
success
as
the
other
the
second
teacher
the
gang
boss
shows
him
how
to
set
up
the
job
in
his
machine
and
teaches
him
to
make
all
of
his
personal
motions
in
the
quickest
and
best
way
the
third
the
speed
boss
sees
that
the
machine
is
run
at
the
best
speed
and
that
the
proper
tool
is
used
in
the
particular
way
which
will
enable
the
machine
to
finish
its
product
in
the
shortest
possible
time
in
addition
to
the
assistance
given
by
these
teachers
the
workman
receives
orders
and
help
from
four
other
men
from
the
repair
boss
as
to
the
adjustment
cleanliness
and
general
care
of
his
machine
belting
etc
from
the
time
clerk
as
to
everything
relating
to
his
pay
and
to
proper
written
reports
and
returns
from
the
route
clerk
as
to
the
order
in
which
he
does
his
work
and
as
to
the
movement
of
the
work
from
one
part
of
the
shop
to
another
and
in
case
a
workman
gets
into
any
trouble
with
any
of
his
various
bosses
the
disciplinarian
interviews
him
it
must
be
understood
of
course
that
all
workmen
engaged
on
the
same
kind
of
work
do
not
require
the
same
amount
of
individual
teaching
and
attention
from
the
functional
foremen
the
men
who
are
new
at
a
given
operation
naturally
require
far
more
teaching
and
watching
than
those
who
have
been
a
long
time
at
the
same
kind
of
jobs
now
when
through
all
of
this
teaching
and
this
minute
instruction
the
work
is
apparently
made
so
smooth
and
easy
for
the
workman
the
first
impression
is
that
this
all
tends
to
make
him
a
mere
automaton
a
wooden
man
as
the
workmen
frequently
say
when
they
first
come
under
this
system
why
i
am
not
allowed
to
think
or
move
without
some
one
interfering
or
doing
it
for
me
the
same
criticism
and
objection
however
can
be
raised
against
all
other
modern
subdivision
of
labor
it
does
not
follow
for
example
that
the
modern
surgeon
is
any
more
narrow
or
wooden
a
man
than
the
early
settler
of
this
country
the
frontiersman
however
had
to
be
not
only
a
surgeon
but
also
an
architect
lumberman
farmer
soldier
and
doctor
and
he
had
to
settle
his
law
cases
with
a
gun
you
would
hardly
say
that
the
life
of
the
modern
surgeon
is
any
more
narrowing
or
that
he
is
more
of
a
wooden
man
than
the
frontiersman
the
many
problems
to
be
met
and
solved
by
the
surgeon
are
just
as
intricate
and
difficult
and
as
developing
and
broadening
in
their
way
as
were
those
of
the
frontiersman
and
it
should
be
remembered
that
the
training
of
the
surgeon
has
been
almost
identical
in
type
with
the
teaching
and
training
which
is
given
to
the
workman
under
scientific
management
the
surgeon
all
through
his
early
years
is
under
the
closest
supervision
of
more
experienced
men
who
show
him
in
the
minutest
way
how
each
element
of
his
work
is
best
done
they
provide
him
with
the
finest
implements
each
one
of
which
has
been
the
subject
of
special
study
and
development
and
then
insist
upon
his
using
each
of
these
implements
in
the
very
best
way
all
of
this
teaching
however
in
no
way
narrows
him
on
the
contrary
he
is
quickly
given
the
very
best
knowledge
of
his
predecessors
and
provided
as
he
is
right
from
the
start
with
standard
implements
and
methods
which
represent
the
best
knowledge
of
the
world
up
to
date
he
is
able
to
use
his
own
originality
and
ingenuity
to
make
real
additions
to
the
knowledge
instead
of
reinventing
things
which
are
old
in
a
similar
way
the
workman
who
is
cooperating
with
his
many
teachers
under
scientific
management
has
an
opportunity
to
develop
which
is
at
least
as
good
as
and
generally
better
than
that
which
he
had
when
the
whole
problem
was
up
to
him
and
he
did
his
work
entirely
unaided
if
it
were
true
that
the
workman
would
develop
into
a
larger
and
finer
man
without
all
of
this
teaching
and
without
the
help
of
the
laws
which
have
been
formulated
for
doing
his
particular
job
then
it
would
follow
that
the
young
man
who
now
comes
to
college
to
have
the
help
of
a
teacher
in
mathematics
physics
chemistry
latin
greek
would
do
better
to
study
these
things
unaided
and
by
himself
the
only
difference
in
the
two
cases
is
that
students
come
to
their
teachers
while
from
the
nature
of
the
work
done
by
the
mechanic
under
scientific
management
the
teachers
must
go
to
him
what
really
happens
is
that
with
the
aid
of
the
science
which
is
invariably
developed
and
through
the
instructions
from
his
teachers
each
workman
of
a
given
intellectual
capacity
is
enabled
to
do
a
much
higher
more
interesting
and
finally
more
developing
and
more
profitable
kind
of
work
than
he
was
before
able
to
do
the
laborer
who
before
was
unable
to
do
anything
beyond
perhaps
shoveling
and
wheeling
dirt
from
place
to
place
or
carrying
the
work
from
one
part
of
the
shop
to
another
is
in
many
cases
taught
to
do
the
more
elementary
machinist
work
accompanied
by
the
agreeable
surroundings
and
the
interesting
variety
and
higher
wages
which
go
with
the
machinist
trade
the
cheap
machinist
or
helper
who
before
was
able
to
run
perhaps
merely
a
drill
press
is
taught
to
do
the
more
intricate
and
higher
priced
lathe
and
planer
work
while
the
highly
skilled
and
more
intelligent
machinists
become
functional
foremen
and
teachers
and
so
on
right
up
the
line
it
may
seem
that
with
scientific
management
there
is
not
the
same
incentive
for
the
workman
to
use
his
ingenuity
in
devising
new
and
better
methods
of
doing
the
work
as
well
as
in
improving
his
implements
that
there
is
with
the
old
type
of
management
it
is
true
that
with
scientific
management
the
workman
is
not
allowed
to
use
whatever
implements
and
methods
he
sees
fit
in
the
daily
practice
of
his
work
every
encouragement
however
should
be
given
him
to
suggest
improvements
both
in
methods
and
in
implements
and
whenever
a
workman
proposes
an
improvement
it
should
be
the
policy
of
the
management
to
make
a
careful
analysis
of
the
new
method
and
if
necessary
conduct
a
series
of
experiments
to
determine
accurately
the
relative
merit
of
the
new
suggestion
and
of
the
old
standard
and
whenever
the
new
method
is
found
to
be
markedly
superior
to
the
old
it
should
be
adopted
as
the
standard
for
the
whole
establishment
the
workman
should
be
given
the
full
credit
for
the
improvement
and
should
be
paid
a
cash
premium
as
a
reward
for
his
ingenuity
in
this
way
the
true
initiative
of
the
workmen
is
better
attained
under
scientific
management
than
under
the
old
individual
plan
the
history
of
the
development
of
scientific
management
up
to
date
however
calls
for
a
word
of
warning
the
mechanism
of
management
must
not
be
mistaken
for
its
essence
or
underlying
philosophy
precisely
the
same
mechanism
will
in
one
case
produce
disastrous
results
and
in
another
the
most
beneficent
the
same
mechanism
which
will
produce
the
finest
results
when
made
to
serve
the
underlying
principles
of
scientific
management
will
lead
to
failure
and
disaster
if
accompanied
by
the
wrong
spirit
in
those
who
are
using
it
hundreds
of
people
have
already
mistaken
the
mechanism
of
this
system
for
its
essence
gantt
barth
and
the
writer
have
presented
papers
to
the
american
society
of
mechanical
engineers
on
the
subject
of
scientific
management
in
these
papers
the
mechanism
which
is
used
has
been
described
at
some
length
as
elements
of
this
mechanism
may
be
cited
time
study
with
the
implements
and
methods
for
properly
making
it
functional
or
divided
foremanship
and
its
superiority
to
the
single
foreman
the
standardization
of
all
tools
and
implements
used
in
the
trades
and
also
of
the
acts
or
movements
of
workmen
for
each
class
of
work
the
desirability
of
a
planning
room
or
department
the
exception
principle
in
management
the
use
of
and
similar
timesaving
implements
instruction
cards
for
the
workman
the
task
idea
in
management
accompanied
by
a
large
bonus
for
the
successful
performance
of
the
task
the
differential
rate
mnemonic
systems
for
classifying
manufactured
products
as
well
as
implements
used
in
manufacturing
a
routing
system
modern
cost
system
etc
these
are
however
merely
the
elements
or
details
of
the
mechanism
of
management
scientific
management
in
its
essence
consists
of
a
certain
philosophy
which
results
as
before
stated
in
a
combination
of
the
four
great
underlying
principles
of
management
first
the
development
of
a
true
science
second
the
scientific
selection
of
the
workman
third
his
scientific
education
and
development
fourth
intimate
friendly
cooperation
between
the
management
and
the
men
when
however
the
elements
of
this
mechanism
such
as
time
study
functional
foremanship
are
used
without
being
accompanied
by
the
true
philosophy
of
management
the
results
are
in
many
cases
disastrous
and
unfortunately
even
when
men
who
are
thoroughly
in
sympathy
with
the
principles
of
scientific
management
undertake
to
change
too
rapidly
from
the
old
type
to
the
new
without
heeding
the
warnings
of
those
who
have
had
years
of
experience
in
making
this
change
they
frequently
meet
with
serious
troubles
and
sometimes
with
strikes
followed
by
failure
the
writer
in
his
paper
on
shop
management
has
called
especial
attention
to
the
risks
which
managers
run
in
attempting
to
change
rapidly
from
the
old
to
the
new
management
in
many
cases
however
this
warning
has
not
been
heeded
the
physical
changes
which
are
needed
the
actual
time
study
which
has
to
be
made
the
standardization
of
all
implements
connected
with
the
work
the
necessity
for
individually
studying
each
machine
and
placing
it
in
perfect
order
all
take
time
but
the
faster
these
elements
of
the
work
are
studied
and
improved
the
better
for
the
undertaking
on
the
other
hand
the
really
great
problem
involved
in
a
change
from
the
management
of
initiative
and
incentive
to
scientific
management
consists
in
a
complete
revolution
in
the
mental
attitude
and
the
habits
of
all
of
those
engaged
in
the
management
as
well
of
the
workmen
and
this
change
can
be
brought
about
only
gradually
and
through
the
presentation
of
many
to
the
workman
which
together
with
the
teaching
which
he
receives
thoroughly
convince
him
of
the
superiority
of
the
new
over
the
old
way
of
doing
the
work
this
change
in
the
mental
attitude
of
the
workman
imperatively
demands
time
it
is
impossible
to
hurry
it
beyond
a
certain
speed
the
writer
has
over
and
over
again
warned
those
who
contemplated
making
this
change
that
it
was
a
matter
even
in
a
simple
establishment
of
from
two
to
three
years
and
that
in
some
cases
it
requires
from
four
to
five
years
the
first
few
changes
which
affect
the
workmen
should
be
made
exceedingly
slowly
and
only
one
workman
at
a
time
should
be
dealt
with
at
the
start
until
this
single
man
has
been
thoroughly
convinced
that
a
great
gain
has
come
to
him
from
the
new
method
no
further
change
should
be
made
then
one
man
after
another
should
be
tactfully
changed
over
after
passing
the
point
at
which
from
to
of
the
men
in
the
employ
of
the
company
have
been
changed
from
the
old
to
the
new
very
rapid
progress
can
be
made
because
at
about
this
time
there
is
generally
a
complete
revolution
in
the
public
opinion
of
the
whole
establishment
and
practically
all
of
the
workmen
who
are
working
under
the
old
system
become
desirous
to
share
in
the
benefits
which
they
see
have
been
received
by
those
working
under
the
new
plan
inasmuch
as
the
writer
has
personally
retired
from
the
business
of
introducing
this
system
of
management
that
is
from
all
work
done
in
return
for
any
money
compensation
he
does
not
hesitate
again
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
those
companies
are
indeed
fortunate
who
can
secure
the
services
of
experts
who
have
had
the
necessary
practical
experience
in
introducing
scientific
management
and
who
have
made
a
special
study
of
its
principles
it
is
not
enough
that
a
man
should
have
been
a
manager
in
an
establishment
which
is
run
under
the
new
principles
the
man
who
undertakes
to
direct
the
steps
to
be
taken
in
changing
from
the
old
to
the
new
particularly
in
any
establishment
doing
elaborate
work
must
have
had
personal
experience
in
overcoming
the
especial
difficulties
which
are
always
met
with
and
which
are
peculiar
to
this
period
of
transition
it
is
for
this
reason
that
the
writer
expects
to
devote
the
rest
of
his
life
chiefly
to
trying
to
help
those
who
wish
to
take
up
this
work
as
their
profession
and
to
advising
the
managers
and
owners
of
companies
in
general
as
to
the
steps
which
they
should
take
in
making
this
change
as
a
warning
to
those
who
contemplate
adopting
scientific
management
the
following
instance
is
given
several
men
who
lacked
the
extended
experience
which
is
required
to
change
without
danger
of
strikes
or
without
interference
with
the
success
of
the
business
from
the
management
of
initiative
and
incentive
to
scientific
management
attempted
rapidly
to
increase
the
output
in
quite
an
elaborate
establishment
employing
between
three
thousand
and
four
thousand
men
those
who
undertook
to
make
this
change
were
men
of
unusual
ability
and
were
at
the
same
time
enthusiasts
and
i
think
had
the
interests
of
the
workmen
truly
at
heart
they
were
however
warned
by
the
writer
before
starting
that
they
must
go
exceedingly
slowly
and
that
the
work
of
making
the
change
in
this
establishment
could
not
be
done
in
less
than
from
three
to
five
years
this
warning
they
entirely
disregarded
they
evidently
believed
that
by
using
much
of
the
mechanism
of
scientific
management
in
combination
with
the
principles
of
the
management
of
initiative
and
incentive
instead
of
with
these
principles
of
scientific
management
that
they
could
do
in
a
year
or
two
what
had
been
proved
in
the
past
to
require
at
least
double
this
time
the
knowledge
obtained
from
accurate
time
study
for
example
is
a
powerful
implement
and
can
be
used
in
one
case
to
promote
harmony
between
the
workmen
and
the
management
by
gradually
educating
training
and
leading
the
workmen
into
new
and
better
methods
of
doing
the
work
or
in
the
other
case
it
may
be
used
more
or
less
as
a
club
to
drive
the
workmen
into
doing
a
larger
day
work
for
approximately
the
same
pay
that
they
received
in
the
past
unfortunately
the
men
who
had
charge
of
this
work
did
not
take
the
time
and
the
trouble
required
to
train
functional
foremen
or
teachers
who
were
fitted
gradually
to
lead
and
educate
the
workmen
they
attempted
through
the
foreman
armed
with
his
new
weapon
accurate
time
study
to
drive
the
workmen
against
their
wishes
and
without
much
increase
in
pay
to
work
much
harder
instead
of
gradually
teaching
and
leading
them
toward
new
methods
and
convincing
them
through
that
task
management
means
for
them
somewhat
harder
work
but
also
far
greater
prosperity
the
result
of
all
this
disregard
of
fundamental
principles
was
a
series
of
strikes
followed
by
the
of
the
men
who
attempted
to
make
the
change
and
by
a
return
to
conditions
throughout
the
establishment
far
worse
than
those
which
existed
before
the
effort
was
made
this
instance
is
cited
as
an
of
the
futility
of
using
the
mechanism
of
the
new
management
while
leaving
out
its
essence
and
also
of
trying
to
shorten
a
necessarily
long
operation
in
entire
disregard
of
past
experience
it
should
be
emphasized
that
the
men
who
undertook
this
work
were
both
able
and
earnest
and
that
failure
was
not
due
to
lack
of
ability
on
their
part
but
to
their
undertaking
to
do
the
impossible
these
particular
men
will
not
again
make
a
similar
mistake
and
it
is
hoped
that
their
experience
may
act
as
a
warning
to
others
in
this
connection
however
it
is
proper
to
again
state
that
during
the
thirty
years
that
we
have
been
engaged
in
introducing
scientific
management
there
has
not
been
a
single
strike
from
those
who
were
working
in
accordance
with
its
principles
even
during
the
critical
period
when
the
change
was
being
made
from
the
old
to
the
new
if
proper
methods
are
used
by
men
who
have
had
experience
in
this
work
there
is
absolutely
no
danger
from
strikes
or
other
troubles
the
writer
would
again
insist
that
in
no
case
should
the
managers
of
an
establishment
the
work
of
which
is
elaborate
undertake
to
change
from
the
old
to
the
new
type
unless
the
directors
of
the
company
fully
understand
and
believe
in
the
fundamental
principles
of
scientific
management
and
unless
they
appreciate
all
that
is
involved
in
making
this
change
particularly
the
time
required
and
unless
they
want
scientific
management
greatly
doubtless
some
of
those
who
are
especially
interested
in
working
men
will
complain
because
under
scientific
management
the
workman
when
he
is
shown
how
to
do
twice
as
much
work
as
he
formerly
did
is
not
paid
twice
his
former
wages
while
others
who
are
more
interested
in
the
dividends
than
the
workmen
will
complain
that
under
this
system
the
men
receive
much
higher
wages
than
they
did
before
it
does
seem
grossly
unjust
when
the
bare
statement
is
made
that
the
competent
handler
for
instance
who
has
been
so
trained
that
he
piles
times
as
much
iron
as
the
incompetent
man
formerly
did
should
receive
an
increase
of
only
per
cent
in
wages
it
is
not
fair
however
to
form
any
final
judgment
until
all
of
the
elements
in
the
case
have
been
considered
at
the
first
glance
we
see
only
two
parties
to
the
transaction
the
workmen
and
their
employers
we
overlook
the
third
great
party
the
whole
people
the
consumers
who
buy
the
product
of
the
first
two
and
who
ultimately
pay
both
the
wages
of
the
workmen
and
the
profits
of
the
employers
the
rights
of
the
people
are
therefore
greater
than
those
of
either
employer
or
employee
and
this
third
great
party
should
be
given
its
proper
share
of
any
gain
in
fact
a
glance
at
industrial
history
shows
that
in
the
end
the
whole
people
receive
the
greater
part
of
the
benefit
coming
from
industrial
improvements
in
the
past
hundred
years
for
example
the
greatest
factor
tending
toward
increasing
the
output
and
thereby
the
prosperity
of
the
civilized
world
has
been
the
introduction
of
machinery
to
replace
hand
labor
and
without
doubt
the
greatest
gain
through
this
change
has
come
to
the
whole
people
the
consumer
through
short
periods
especially
in
the
case
of
patented
apparatus
the
dividends
of
those
who
have
introduced
new
machinery
have
been
greatly
increased
and
in
many
cases
though
unfortunately
not
universally
the
employees
have
obtained
materially
higher
wages
shorter
hours
and
better
working
conditions
but
in
the
end
the
major
part
of
the
gain
has
gone
to
the
whole
people
and
this
result
will
follow
the
introduction
of
scientific
management
just
as
surely
as
it
has
the
introduction
of
machinery
to
return
to
the
case
of
the
handler
we
must
assume
then
that
the
larger
part
of
the
gain
which
has
come
from
his
great
increase
in
output
will
in
the
end
go
to
the
people
in
the
form
of
cheaper
and
before
deciding
upon
how
the
balance
is
to
be
divided
between
the
workmen
and
the
employer
as
to
what
is
just
and
fair
compensation
for
the
man
who
does
the
piling
and
what
should
be
left
for
the
company
as
profit
we
must
look
at
the
matter
from
all
sides
first
as
we
have
before
stated
the
handler
is
not
an
extraordinary
man
difficult
to
find
he
is
merely
a
man
more
or
less
of
the
type
of
the
ox
heavy
both
mentally
and
physically
second
the
work
which
this
man
does
tires
him
no
more
than
any
healthy
normal
laborer
is
tired
by
a
proper
day
work
if
this
man
is
overtired
by
his
work
then
the
task
has
been
wrongly
set
and
this
is
as
far
as
possible
from
the
object
of
scientific
management
third
it
was
not
due
to
this
man
initiative
or
originality
that
he
did
his
big
day
work
but
to
the
knowledge
of
the
science
of
handling
developed
and
taught
him
by
some
one
else
fourth
it
is
just
and
fair
that
men
of
the
same
general
grade
when
their
capacities
are
considered
should
be
paid
about
the
same
wages
when
they
are
all
working
to
the
best
of
their
abilities
it
would
be
grossly
unjust
to
other
laborers
for
instance
to
pay
this
man
as
high
wages
as
other
men
of
his
general
grade
receive
for
an
honest
full
day
work
fifth
as
is
explained
page
the
per
cent
increase
in
pay
which
he
received
was
not
the
result
of
an
arbitrary
judgment
of
a
foreman
or
superintendent
it
was
the
result
of
a
long
series
of
careful
experiments
impartially
made
to
determine
what
compensation
is
really
for
the
man
true
and
best
interest
when
all
things
are
considered
thus
we
see
that
the
handler
with
his
per
cent
increase
in
wages
is
not
an
object
for
pity
but
rather
a
subject
for
congratulation
after
all
however
facts
are
in
many
cases
more
convincing
than
opinions
or
theories
and
it
is
a
significant
fact
that
those
workmen
who
have
come
under
this
system
during
the
past
thirty
years
have
invariably
been
satisfied
with
the
increase
in
pay
which
they
have
received
while
their
employers
have
been
equally
pleased
with
their
increase
in
dividends
the
writer
is
one
of
those
who
believes
that
more
and
more
will
the
third
party
the
whole
people
as
it
becomes
acquainted
with
the
true
facts
insist
that
justice
shall
be
done
to
all
three
parties
it
will
demand
the
largest
efficiency
from
both
employers
and
employees
it
will
no
longer
tolerate
the
type
of
employer
who
has
his
eye
on
dividends
alone
who
refuses
to
do
his
full
share
of
the
work
and
who
merely
cracks
his
whip
over
the
heads
of
his
workmen
and
attempts
to
drive
them
into
harder
work
for
low
pay
no
more
will
it
tolerate
tyranny
on
the
part
of
labor
which
demands
one
increase
after
another
in
pay
and
shorter
hours
while
at
the
same
time
it
becomes
less
instead
of
more
efficient
and
the
means
which
the
writer
firmly
believes
will
be
adopted
to
bring
about
first
efficiency
both
in
employer
and
employs
and
then
an
equitable
division
of
the
profits
of
their
joint
efforts
will
be
scientific
management
which
has
for
its
sole
aim
the
attainment
of
justice
for
all
three
parties
through
impartial
scientific
investigation
of
all
the
elements
of
the
problem
for
a
time
both
sides
will
rebel
against
this
advance
the
workers
will
resent
any
interference
with
their
old
methods
and
the
management
will
resent
being
asked
to
take
on
new
duties
and
burdens
but
in
the
end
the
people
through
enlightened
public
opinion
will
force
the
new
order
of
things
upon
both
employer
and
employee
it
will
doubtless
be
claimed
that
in
all
that
has
been
said
no
new
fact
has
been
brought
to
light
that
was
not
known
to
some
one
in
the
past
very
likely
this
is
true
scientific
management
does
not
necessarily
involve
any
great
invention
nor
the
discovery
of
new
or
startling
facts
it
does
however
involve
a
certain
combination
of
elements
which
have
not
existed
in
the
past
namely
old
knowledge
so
collected
analyzed
grouped
and
classified
into
laws
and
rules
that
it
constitutes
a
science
accompanied
by
a
complete
change
in
the
mental
attitude
of
the
working
men
as
well
as
of
those
on
the
side
of
the
management
toward
each
other
and
toward
their
respective
duties
and
responsibilities
also
a
new
division
of
the
duties
between
the
two
sides
and
intimate
friendly
cooperation
to
an
extent
that
is
impossible
under
the
philosophy
of
the
old
management
and
even
all
of
this
in
many
cases
could
not
exist
without
the
help
of
mechanisms
which
have
been
gradually
developed
it
is
no
single
element
but
rather
this
whole
combination
that
constitutes
scientific
management
which
may
be
summarized
as
science
not
rule
of
thumb
harmony
not
discord
cooperation
not
individualism
maximum
output
in
place
of
restricted
output
the
development
of
each
man
to
his
greatest
efficiency
and
prosperity
the
writer
wishes
to
again
state
that
the
time
is
fast
going
by
for
the
great
personal
or
individual
achievement
of
any
one
man
standing
alone
and
without
the
help
of
those
around
him
and
the
time
is
coming
when
all
great
things
will
be
done
by
that
type
of
cooperation
in
which
each
man
performs
the
function
for
which
he
is
best
suited
each
man
preserves
his
own
individuality
and
is
supreme
in
his
particular
function
and
each
man
at
the
same
time
loses
none
of
his
originality
and
proper
personal
initiative
and
yet
is
controlled
by
and
must
work
harmoniously
with
many
other
men
the
examples
given
above
of
the
increase
in
output
realized
under
the
new
management
fairly
represent
the
gain
which
is
possible
they
do
not
represent
extraordinary
or
exceptional
cases
and
have
been
selected
from
among
thousands
of
similar
illustrations
which
might
have
been
given
let
us
now
examine
the
good
which
would
follow
the
general
adoption
of
these
principles
the
larger
profit
would
come
to
the
whole
world
in
general
the
greatest
material
gain
which
those
of
the
present
generation
have
over
past
generations
has
come
from
the
fact
that
the
average
man
in
this
generation
with
a
given
expenditure
of
effort
is
producing
two
times
three
times
even
four
times
as
much
of
those
things
that
are
of
use
to
man
as
it
was
possible
for
the
average
man
in
the
past
to
produce
this
increase
in
the
productivity
of
human
effort
is
of
course
due
to
many
causes
besides
the
increase
in
the
personal
dexterity
of
the
man
it
is
due
to
the
discovery
of
steam
and
electricity
to
the
introduction
of
machinery
to
inventions
great
and
small
and
to
the
progress
in
science
and
education
but
from
whatever
cause
this
increase
in
productivity
has
come
it
is
to
the
greater
productivity
of
each
individual
that
the
whole
country
owes
its
greater
prosperity
those
who
are
afraid
that
a
large
increase
in
the
productivity
of
each
workman
will
throw
other
men
out
of
work
should
realize
that
the
one
element
more
than
any
other
which
differentiates
civilized
from
uncivilized
countries
prosperous
from
poverty
stricken
peoples
is
that
the
average
man
in
the
one
is
five
or
six
times
as
productive
as
the
other
it
is
also
a
fact
that
the
chief
cause
for
the
large
percentage
of
the
unemployed
in
england
perhaps
the
most
virile
nation
in
the
world
is
that
the
workmen
of
england
more
than
in
any
other
civilized
country
are
deliberately
restricting
their
output
because
they
are
possessed
by
the
fallacy
that
it
is
against
their
best
interest
for
each
man
to
work
as
hard
as
he
can
the
general
adoption
of
scientific
management
would
readily
in
the
future
double
the
productivity
of
the
average
man
engaged
in
industrial
work
think
of
what
this
means
to
the
whole
country
think
of
the
increase
both
in
the
necessities
and
luxuries
of
life
which
becomes
available
for
the
whole
country
of
the
possibility
of
shortening
the
hours
of
labor
when
this
is
desirable
and
of
the
increased
opportunities
for
education
culture
and
recreation
which
this
implies
but
while
the
whole
world
would
profit
by
this
increase
in
production
the
manufacturer
and
the
workman
will
be
far
more
interested
in
the
especial
local
gain
that
comes
to
them
and
to
the
people
immediately
around
them
scientific
management
will
mean
for
the
employers
and
the
workmen
who
adopt
it
and
particularly
for
those
who
adopt
it
first
the
elimination
of
almost
all
causes
for
dispute
and
disagreement
between
them
what
constitutes
a
fair
day
work
will
be
a
question
for
scientific
investigation
instead
of
a
subject
to
be
bargained
and
haggled
over
soldiering
will
cease
because
the
object
for
soldiering
will
no
longer
exist
the
great
increase
in
wages
which
accompanies
this
type
of
management
will
largely
eliminate
the
wage
question
as
a
source
of
dispute
but
more
than
all
other
causes
the
close
intimate
cooperation
the
constant
personal
contact
between
the
two
sides
will
tend
to
diminish
friction
and
discontent
it
is
difficult
for
two
people
whose
interests
are
the
same
and
who
work
side
by
side
in
accomplishing
the
same
object
all
day
long
to
keep
up
a
quarrel
the
low
cost
of
production
which
accompanies
a
doubling
of
the
output
will
enable
the
companies
who
adopt
this
management
particularly
those
who
adopt
it
first
to
compete
far
better
than
they
were
able
to
before
and
this
will
so
enlarge
their
markets
that
their
men
will
have
almost
constant
work
even
in
dull
times
and
that
they
will
earn
larger
profits
at
all
times
this
means
increase
in
prosperity
and
diminution
in
poverty
not
only
for
their
men
but
for
the
whole
community
immediately
around
them
as
one
of
the
elements
incident
to
this
great
gain
in
output
each
workman
has
been
systematically
trained
to
his
highest
state
of
efficiency
and
has
been
taught
to
do
a
higher
class
of
work
than
he
was
able
to
do
under
the
old
types
of
management
and
at
the
same
time
he
has
acquired
a
friendly
mental
attitude
toward
his
employers
and
his
whole
working
conditions
whereas
before
a
considerable
part
of
his
time
was
spent
in
criticism
suspicious
watchfulness
and
sometimes
in
open
warfare
this
direct
gain
to
all
of
those
working
under
the
system
is
without
doubt
the
most
important
single
element
in
the
whole
problem
is
not
the
realization
of
results
such
as
these
of
far
more
importance
than
the
solution
of
most
of
the
problems
which
are
now
agitating
both
the
english
and
american
peoples
and
is
it
not
the
duty
of
those
who
are
acquainted
with
these
facts
to
exert
themselves
to
make
the
whole
community
realize
this
importance
