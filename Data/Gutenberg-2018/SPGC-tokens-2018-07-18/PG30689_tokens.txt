horace
ventimore
receives
a
commission
this
day
six
weeks
just
six
weeks
ago
horace
ventimore
said
half
aloud
to
himself
and
pulled
out
his
watch
twelve
what
was
i
doing
at
twelve
as
he
sat
at
the
window
of
his
office
in
great
cloister
street
westminster
he
made
his
thoughts
travel
back
to
a
certain
glorious
morning
in
august
which
now
seemed
so
remote
and
irrecoverable
at
this
precise
time
he
was
waiting
on
the
balcony
of
the
hôtel
de
la
plage
the
sole
hostelry
of
the
tiny
normandy
upon
which
by
some
happy
inspiration
he
had
lighted
during
a
solitary
cycling
tour
waiting
until
she
should
appear
he
could
see
the
whole
scene
the
tiny
cove
with
the
violet
shadow
of
the
cliff
sleeping
on
the
green
water
the
swell
of
the
waves
lazily
lapping
against
the
from
which
he
had
plunged
half
an
hour
before
he
remembered
the
long
swim
out
to
the
buoy
the
exhilarated
anticipation
with
which
he
had
dressed
and
climbed
the
steep
path
to
the
hotel
terrace
for
was
he
not
to
pass
the
whole
remainder
of
that
blissful
day
in
sylvia
futvoye
society
were
they
not
to
cycle
together
there
were
of
course
others
of
the
party
but
they
did
not
count
to
cycle
over
to
veulettes
to
picnic
there
under
the
cliff
and
ride
back
always
together
in
the
dusk
over
the
slopes
between
the
poplars
or
the
cornfields
glowing
golden
against
a
sky
of
warm
purple
now
he
saw
himself
going
round
to
the
gravelled
courtyard
in
front
of
the
hotel
with
a
sudden
dread
of
missing
her
there
was
nothing
there
but
the
little
low
cart
with
its
canvas
tilt
which
was
to
convey
professor
futvoye
and
his
wife
to
the
place
of
there
was
sylvia
at
last
distractingly
fair
and
fresh
in
her
cool
pink
blouse
and
skirt
how
gracious
and
friendly
and
generally
delightful
she
had
been
throughout
that
unforgettable
day
which
was
supreme
amongst
others
only
a
little
less
perfect
and
all
now
fled
for
ever
they
had
had
drawbacks
it
was
true
old
futvoye
was
perhaps
the
least
bit
of
a
bore
at
times
with
his
interminable
disquisitions
on
egyptian
art
and
ancient
oriental
in
which
he
seemed
convinced
that
horace
must
feel
a
perfervid
interest
as
indeed
he
thought
it
politic
to
affect
the
professor
was
a
most
learned
archæologist
and
positively
bulged
with
information
on
his
favourite
subjects
but
it
is
just
possible
that
horace
might
have
been
less
curious
concerning
the
distinction
between
cuneiform
and
aramæan
or
kufic
and
arabic
inscriptions
if
his
informant
had
happened
to
be
the
father
of
anybody
else
however
such
insincerities
as
these
are
but
so
many
evidences
of
sincerity
so
with
ingenuity
horace
conjured
up
various
pictures
from
that
norman
holiday
of
his
the
little
cottages
with
their
faded
blue
shutters
and
the
rushes
growing
out
of
their
thatch
roofs
the
spires
of
village
churches
gleaming
above
the
beeches
the
bold
headlands
their
ochre
and
yellow
cliffs
contrasting
grimly
with
the
soft
ridges
of
the
turf
above
them
the
tethered
cattle
grazing
peacefully
against
a
background
of
lapis
lazuli
and
malachite
sea
and
in
every
scene
the
sensation
of
near
presence
the
sound
of
her
voice
in
his
ears
and
now
he
looked
up
from
the
papers
and
on
his
desk
and
round
the
small
panelled
room
which
served
him
as
an
office
at
the
framed
plans
and
photographs
the
set
squares
and
t
squares
on
the
walls
and
felt
a
dull
resentment
against
his
surroundings
from
his
window
he
commanded
a
cheerful
view
of
a
tall
mouldering
wall
once
part
of
the
abbey
boundaries
surmounted
by
above
whose
spikes
some
plane
trees
stretched
their
yellowing
branches
she
would
have
come
to
care
for
me
horace
thoughts
ran
on
disjointedly
i
could
have
sworn
that
that
last
day
of
all
and
her
people
did
seem
to
object
to
me
her
mother
asked
me
cordially
enough
to
call
on
them
when
they
were
back
in
town
when
i
did
when
he
had
called
there
had
been
a
difference
not
an
unusual
sequel
to
an
acquaintanceship
begun
in
a
continental
it
was
difficult
to
define
but
unmistakable
a
certain
formality
and
constraint
on
futvoye
part
and
even
on
sylvia
which
seemed
intended
to
warn
him
that
it
is
not
every
friendship
that
survives
the
channel
passage
so
he
had
gone
away
sore
at
heart
but
fully
recognising
that
any
advances
in
future
must
come
from
their
side
they
might
ask
him
to
dinner
or
at
least
to
call
again
but
more
than
a
month
had
passed
and
they
had
made
no
sign
no
it
was
all
over
he
must
consider
himself
dropped
after
all
he
told
himself
with
a
short
and
anything
but
mirthful
laugh
it
natural
enough
futvoye
has
probably
been
making
inquiries
about
my
professional
prospects
it
better
as
it
is
what
earthly
chance
have
i
got
of
marrying
unless
i
can
get
work
of
my
own
it
all
i
can
do
to
keep
myself
decently
i
no
right
to
dream
of
asking
any
one
to
say
nothing
of
sylvia
to
marry
me
i
should
only
be
rushing
into
temptation
if
i
saw
any
more
of
her
she
not
for
a
poor
beggar
like
me
who
was
born
unlucky
well
whining
wo
do
any
good
let
have
a
look
at
beevor
latest
performance
he
spread
out
a
large
coloured
plan
in
a
corner
of
which
appeared
the
name
of
william
beevor
architect
and
began
to
study
it
in
a
spirit
of
anything
but
appreciation
beevor
gets
on
he
said
to
himself
heaven
knows
that
i
do
grudge
him
his
success
he
a
good
fellow
though
he
build
architectural
atrocities
and
seem
to
like
who
am
i
to
give
myself
airs
he
successful
i
not
yet
if
i
only
had
his
opportunities
what
would
i
make
of
them
let
it
be
said
here
that
this
was
not
the
ordinary
of
an
incompetent
ventimore
really
had
talent
above
the
average
with
ideals
and
ambitions
which
might
under
better
conditions
have
attained
recognition
and
fulfilment
before
this
but
he
was
not
quite
energetic
enough
besides
being
too
proud
to
push
himself
into
notice
and
hitherto
he
had
met
with
persistent
so
horace
had
no
other
occupation
now
but
to
give
beevor
whose
offices
and
clerk
he
shared
such
slight
assistance
as
he
might
require
and
it
was
by
no
means
cheering
to
feel
that
every
year
of
this
enforced
left
him
further
handicapped
in
the
race
for
wealth
and
fame
for
he
had
already
passed
his
birthday
if
miss
sylvia
futvoye
had
indeed
felt
attracted
towards
him
at
one
time
it
was
not
altogether
incomprehensible
horace
ventimore
was
not
a
model
of
manly
beauty
models
of
manly
beauty
are
rare
out
of
novels
and
seldom
interesting
in
them
but
his
face
possessed
a
certain
distinction
and
if
there
were
faint
satirical
lines
about
the
mouth
they
were
redeemed
by
the
expression
of
the
eyes
which
were
remarkably
frank
and
pleasant
he
was
well
made
and
tall
enough
to
escape
all
danger
of
being
described
as
short
and
pale
without
being
unhealthily
pallid
in
complexion
and
he
gave
the
impression
of
being
a
man
who
took
life
as
it
came
and
whose
sense
of
humour
would
serve
as
a
lining
for
most
clouds
that
might
darken
his
horizon
there
was
a
rap
at
the
door
which
communicated
with
beevor
office
and
beevor
himself
a
florid
man
with
small
burst
in
i
say
ventimore
you
did
run
off
with
the
plans
for
that
house
building
at
larchmere
did
you
because
ah
i
see
you
looking
over
them
sorry
to
deprive
you
but
thanks
old
fellow
take
them
by
all
means
i
seen
all
i
wanted
to
see
well
i
just
off
to
larchmere
now
want
to
be
there
to
check
the
quantities
and
there
my
other
house
at
fittlesdon
i
must
go
on
afterwards
and
set
it
out
so
i
shall
probably
be
away
some
days
taking
harrison
down
too
you
wo
be
wanting
him
eh
ventimore
laughed
i
can
manage
to
do
nothing
without
a
clerk
to
help
me
your
necessity
is
greater
than
mine
here
are
the
plans
i
rather
pleased
with
myself
you
know
said
beevor
that
roof
ought
to
look
well
eh
good
idea
of
mine
lightening
the
slate
with
that
ornamental
along
the
top
you
saw
i
put
in
one
of
your
windows
with
just
a
trifling
addition
i
was
almost
inclined
to
keep
both
gables
alike
as
you
suggested
but
it
struck
me
a
little
variety
one
red
brick
and
the
other
would
be
more
oh
much
agreed
ventimore
knowing
that
to
disagree
was
useless
not
mind
you
continued
beevor
that
i
believe
in
going
in
for
too
much
originality
in
domestic
architecture
the
average
client
no
more
wants
an
original
house
than
he
wants
an
original
hat
he
wants
something
he
wo
feel
a
fool
in
i
often
thought
old
man
that
perhaps
the
reason
why
you
have
got
on
you
do
mind
my
speaking
candidly
do
you
not
a
bit
said
ventimore
cheerfully
candour
the
cement
of
friendship
dab
it
on
well
i
was
only
going
to
say
that
you
do
yourself
no
good
by
all
those
confoundedly
unconventional
ideas
of
yours
if
you
had
your
chance
it
my
belief
you
throw
it
away
by
insisting
on
some
fantastic
fad
or
other
these
speculations
are
a
trifle
premature
considering
that
there
does
seem
the
remotest
prospect
of
my
ever
getting
a
chance
at
all
i
got
mine
before
i
set
up
six
months
said
beevor
the
great
thing
however
he
went
on
with
a
flavour
of
personal
application
is
to
know
how
to
use
it
when
it
come
well
i
must
be
off
if
i
mean
to
catch
that
one
from
waterloo
you
see
to
anything
that
may
come
in
for
me
while
i
away
wo
you
and
let
me
know
oh
by
the
way
the
quantity
surveyor
has
just
sent
in
the
quantities
for
that
schoolroom
at
woodford
do
you
mind
running
through
them
and
seeing
they
right
and
there
the
specification
for
the
new
wing
at
tusculum
lodge
you
might
draft
that
some
time
when
you
nothing
else
to
do
you
find
all
the
papers
on
my
desk
thanks
awfully
old
chap
and
beevor
hurried
back
to
his
own
room
where
for
the
next
few
minutes
he
could
be
heard
bustling
harrison
the
clerk
to
make
haste
then
a
hansom
was
whistled
for
there
were
footsteps
down
the
old
stairs
the
sounds
of
a
departing
vehicle
on
the
uneven
stones
and
after
that
silence
and
solitude
it
was
not
in
nature
to
avoid
feeling
a
little
envious
beevor
had
work
to
do
in
the
world
even
if
it
chiefly
consisted
in
profaning
sylvan
retreats
by
smug
or
pretentious
villas
it
was
still
work
which
entitled
him
to
consideration
and
respect
in
the
eyes
of
all
persons
and
nobody
believed
in
horace
as
yet
he
had
never
known
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
the
work
of
his
brain
realised
in
stone
and
brick
and
mortar
no
building
stood
anywhere
to
bear
testimony
to
his
existence
and
capability
long
after
he
himself
should
have
passed
away
it
was
not
a
profitable
train
of
thought
and
to
escape
from
it
he
went
into
beevor
room
and
fetched
the
documents
he
had
mentioned
at
least
they
would
keep
him
occupied
until
it
was
time
to
go
to
his
club
and
lunch
he
had
no
sooner
settled
down
to
his
calculations
however
when
he
heard
a
shuffling
step
on
the
landing
followed
by
a
knock
at
beevor
more
work
for
beevor
he
thought
what
luck
the
fellow
has
i
better
go
in
and
explain
that
he
just
left
town
on
business
but
on
entering
the
adjoining
room
he
heard
the
knocking
repeated
this
time
at
his
own
door
and
hastening
back
to
put
an
end
to
this
somewhat
undignified
form
of
he
discovered
that
this
visitor
at
least
was
legitimately
his
and
was
in
fact
no
other
than
professor
anthony
futvoye
himself
the
professor
was
standing
in
the
doorway
peering
through
his
convex
glasses
his
head
protruded
from
his
with
an
irresistible
suggestion
of
an
inquiring
tortoise
to
horace
his
appearance
was
more
welcome
than
that
of
the
wealthiest
client
for
why
should
sylvia
father
take
the
trouble
to
pay
him
this
visit
unless
he
still
wished
to
continue
the
acquaintanceship
it
might
even
be
that
he
was
the
bearer
of
some
message
or
invitation
so
although
to
an
impartial
eye
the
professor
might
not
seem
the
kind
of
elderly
gentleman
whose
society
would
produce
any
wild
degree
of
exhilaration
horace
was
unfeignedly
delighted
to
see
him
extremely
kind
of
you
to
come
and
see
me
like
this
sir
he
said
warmly
after
establishing
him
in
the
solitary
armchair
reserved
for
hypothetical
clients
not
at
all
i
afraid
your
visit
to
cottesmore
gardens
some
time
ago
was
somewhat
of
a
disappointment
a
disappointment
echoed
horace
at
a
loss
to
know
what
was
coming
next
i
refer
to
the
fact
which
possibly
however
escaped
your
notice
explained
the
professor
scratching
his
scanty
patch
of
grizzled
whisker
with
a
touch
of
irascibility
that
i
myself
was
not
at
home
on
that
occasion
indeed
i
was
greatly
disappointed
said
horace
though
of
course
i
know
how
much
you
are
engaged
it
all
the
more
good
of
you
to
spare
time
to
drop
in
for
a
chat
just
now
i
not
come
to
chat
ventimore
i
never
chat
i
wanted
to
see
you
about
a
matter
which
i
thought
you
might
be
so
obliging
as
to
but
i
observe
you
are
busy
probably
too
busy
to
attend
to
such
a
small
affair
it
was
clear
enough
now
the
professor
was
going
to
build
and
had
decided
could
it
be
at
sylvia
suggestion
to
entrust
the
work
to
him
but
he
contrived
to
subdue
any
eagerness
and
reply
as
he
could
with
perfect
truth
that
he
had
nothing
on
hand
just
then
which
he
could
not
lay
aside
and
that
if
the
professor
would
let
him
know
what
he
required
he
would
take
it
up
at
once
so
much
the
better
said
the
professor
so
much
the
better
both
my
wife
and
daughter
declared
that
it
was
making
far
too
great
a
demand
upon
your
good
nature
but
as
i
told
them
am
much
mistaken
i
said
ventimore
practice
is
so
extensive
that
he
can
not
leave
it
for
one
afternoon
evidently
it
was
not
a
house
could
he
be
needed
to
escort
them
somewhere
that
afternoon
even
that
was
more
than
he
had
hoped
for
a
few
minutes
since
he
hastened
to
repeat
that
he
was
perfectly
free
that
afternoon
in
that
case
said
the
professor
beginning
to
fumble
in
all
his
pockets
was
he
searching
for
a
note
in
sylvia
handwriting
in
that
case
you
will
be
conferring
a
real
favour
on
me
if
you
can
make
it
convenient
to
attend
a
sale
at
hammond
auction
rooms
in
covent
garden
and
just
bid
for
one
or
two
articles
on
my
behalf
whatever
disappointment
ventimore
felt
it
may
be
said
to
his
credit
that
he
allowed
no
sign
of
it
to
appear
of
course
i
go
with
pleasure
he
said
if
i
can
be
of
any
use
i
knew
i
should
come
to
you
in
vain
said
the
professor
i
remembered
your
wonderful
good
nature
sir
in
accompanying
my
wife
and
daughter
on
all
sorts
of
expeditions
in
the
blazing
hot
weather
we
had
at
luc
when
you
might
have
remained
quietly
at
the
hotel
with
me
not
that
i
should
trouble
you
now
only
i
have
to
lunch
at
the
oriental
club
and
i
an
appointment
afterwards
to
examine
and
report
on
a
inscribed
cylinder
for
the
museum
which
will
fully
occupy
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
so
that
it
physically
impossible
for
me
to
go
to
hammond
myself
and
i
strongly
object
to
employing
a
broker
when
i
can
avoid
it
where
did
i
put
that
catalogue
ah
here
it
is
this
was
sent
to
me
by
the
executors
of
my
old
friend
general
collingham
who
died
the
other
day
i
met
him
at
nakada
when
i
was
out
excavating
some
years
ago
he
was
something
of
a
collector
in
his
way
though
he
knew
very
little
about
it
and
of
course
was
taken
in
right
and
left
most
of
his
things
are
downright
rubbish
but
there
are
just
a
few
lots
that
are
worth
securing
at
a
reasonable
figure
by
some
one
who
knew
what
he
was
about
but
my
dear
professor
remonstrated
horace
not
relishing
this
responsibility
i
afraid
i
as
likely
as
not
to
pick
up
some
of
the
rubbish
i
no
special
knowledge
of
oriental
curios
at
luc
said
the
professor
you
impressed
me
as
having
for
an
amateur
an
exceptionally
accurate
and
comprehensive
acquaintance
with
egyptian
and
arabian
art
from
the
earliest
period
if
this
were
so
horace
could
only
feel
with
shame
what
a
fearful
humbug
he
must
have
been
however
i
no
wish
to
lay
too
heavy
a
burden
on
you
and
as
you
will
see
from
this
catalogue
i
have
ticked
off
the
lots
in
which
i
am
chiefly
interested
and
made
a
note
of
the
limit
to
which
i
am
prepared
to
bid
so
you
have
no
difficulty
very
well
said
horace
i
go
straight
to
covent
garden
and
slip
out
and
get
some
lunch
later
on
well
perhaps
if
you
do
mind
the
lots
i
have
marked
seem
to
come
on
at
rather
frequent
intervals
but
do
let
that
consideration
deter
you
from
getting
your
lunch
and
if
you
miss
anything
by
not
being
on
the
spot
why
it
of
no
consequence
though
i
do
say
it
might
be
a
pity
in
any
case
you
wo
forget
to
mark
what
each
lot
fetches
and
perhaps
you
would
mind
dropping
me
a
line
when
you
return
the
catalogue
or
stay
could
you
look
in
some
time
after
dinner
this
evening
and
let
me
know
how
you
got
on
that
would
be
better
horace
thought
it
would
be
decidedly
better
and
undertook
to
call
and
render
an
account
of
his
stewardship
that
evening
there
remained
the
question
of
a
deposit
should
one
or
more
of
the
lots
be
knocked
down
to
him
and
as
he
was
obliged
to
own
that
he
had
not
so
much
as
ten
pounds
about
him
at
that
particular
moment
the
professor
extracted
a
note
for
that
amount
from
his
case
and
handed
it
to
him
with
the
air
of
a
benevolent
person
relieving
a
deserving
object
do
exceed
my
limits
he
said
for
i
ca
afford
more
just
now
and
mind
you
give
hammond
your
own
name
not
mine
if
the
dealers
get
to
know
i
after
the
things
they
run
you
up
and
now
i
do
think
i
need
detain
you
any
longer
especially
as
time
is
running
on
i
sure
i
can
trust
you
to
do
the
best
you
can
for
me
till
this
evening
then
a
few
minutes
later
horace
was
driving
up
to
covent
garden
behind
the
horse
he
could
pick
out
the
professor
might
have
required
from
him
rather
more
than
was
strictly
justified
by
their
acquaintanceship
and
taken
his
acquiescence
too
much
as
a
matter
of
course
but
what
of
that
after
all
he
was
parent
even
with
luck
he
was
thinking
i
ought
to
succeed
in
getting
at
least
one
or
two
of
the
lots
he
marked
and
if
i
can
only
please
him
something
may
come
of
it
and
in
this
sanguine
mood
horace
entered
hammond
auction
rooms
chapter
ii
a
cheap
lot
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
was
the
luncheon
hour
when
ventimore
reached
hammond
auction
rooms
he
found
the
big
skylighted
gallery
where
the
sale
of
the
furniture
and
effects
of
the
late
general
collingham
was
proceeding
crowded
to
a
degree
which
showed
that
the
deceased
officer
had
some
reputation
as
a
the
narrow
green
baize
tables
below
the
auctioneer
rostrum
were
occupied
by
professional
dealers
one
or
two
of
them
women
who
sat
paper
and
pencil
in
hand
with
much
the
same
air
of
apparent
apathy
and
real
vigilance
that
may
be
noticed
in
the
casino
at
monte
carlo
around
them
stood
a
decorous
and
businesslike
crowd
mostly
dealers
of
various
types
on
a
bench
sat
the
auctioneer
conducting
the
sale
with
a
judicial
impartiality
and
dignity
which
forbade
him
even
in
his
most
laudatory
comments
the
faintest
accent
of
enthusiasm
the
october
sunshine
striking
through
the
glazed
roof
the
tarnished
and
suffused
the
dusty
atmosphere
with
palest
gold
but
somehow
the
utter
absence
of
excitement
in
the
crowd
the
calm
methodical
tone
of
the
auctioneer
and
the
occasional
mournful
cry
of
lot
here
gentlemen
from
the
porter
when
any
article
was
too
large
to
move
all
served
to
depress
ventimore
usually
mercurial
spirits
for
all
horace
knew
the
collection
as
a
whole
might
be
of
little
value
but
it
very
soon
became
clear
that
others
besides
professor
futvoye
had
singled
out
such
gems
as
there
were
also
that
the
professor
had
considerably
the
prices
they
were
likely
to
fetch
ventimore
made
his
bids
with
all
possible
discretion
but
time
after
time
he
found
the
competition
for
some
perforated
mosque
lantern
engraved
ewer
or
ancient
porcelain
tile
so
great
that
his
limit
was
soon
reached
and
his
sole
consolation
was
that
the
article
eventually
changed
hands
for
sums
which
were
very
nearly
double
the
estimate
several
dealers
and
brokers
despairing
of
a
bargain
that
day
left
murmuring
profanities
most
of
those
who
remained
ceased
to
take
a
serious
interest
in
the
proceedings
and
consoled
themselves
with
cheap
witticisms
at
every
favourable
occasion
the
sale
dragged
slowly
on
and
what
with
continual
disappointment
and
want
of
food
horace
began
to
feel
so
weary
that
he
was
glad
as
the
crowd
thinned
to
get
a
seat
at
one
of
the
green
baize
tables
by
which
time
the
skylights
had
already
changed
from
livid
grey
to
slate
colour
in
the
deepening
dusk
a
couple
of
meek
burmese
buddhas
had
just
been
put
up
and
bore
the
indignity
of
being
knocked
down
for
the
pair
with
dreamy
inscrutable
simpers
horace
only
waited
for
the
final
lot
marked
by
the
professor
an
old
persian
copper
bowl
inlaid
with
silver
and
engraved
round
the
rim
with
an
inscription
from
hafiz
the
limit
to
which
he
was
authorised
to
go
was
two
pounds
ten
but
so
desperately
anxious
was
ventimore
not
to
return
that
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
bid
an
extra
sovereign
if
necessary
and
say
nothing
about
it
however
the
bowl
was
put
up
and
the
bidding
soon
rose
to
three
pounds
ten
four
pounds
four
pounds
ten
five
pounds
five
guineas
for
which
last
sum
it
was
acquired
by
a
bearded
man
on
horace
right
who
immediately
began
to
regard
his
purchase
with
a
more
indulgent
eye
ventimore
had
done
his
best
and
failed
there
was
no
reason
now
why
he
should
stay
a
moment
longer
and
yet
he
sat
on
from
sheer
fatigue
and
disinclination
to
move
now
we
come
to
lot
gentlemen
he
heard
the
auctioneer
saying
mechanically
a
capital
egyptian
in
fine
con
no
i
beg
pardon
i
wrong
this
is
an
article
which
by
some
mistake
has
been
omitted
from
the
catalogue
though
it
ought
to
have
been
in
it
everything
on
sale
gentlemen
belonged
to
the
late
general
collingham
we
call
this
no
antique
brass
bottle
very
curious
one
of
the
porters
carried
the
bottle
in
between
the
tables
and
set
it
down
before
the
dealers
at
the
farther
end
with
a
tired
nonchalance
it
was
an
old
squat
vessel
about
two
feet
high
with
a
long
thick
neck
the
mouth
of
which
was
closed
by
a
sort
of
metal
stopper
or
cap
there
was
no
visible
decoration
on
its
sides
which
were
rough
and
pitted
by
some
incrustation
that
had
formed
on
them
and
been
partially
scraped
off
as
a
piece
of
it
certainly
possessed
few
attractions
and
there
was
a
marked
tendency
to
guy
it
among
the
more
frivolous
brethren
what
do
you
call
this
sir
inquired
one
of
the
auctioneer
with
the
manner
of
a
cheeky
boy
trying
to
get
a
rise
out
of
his
is
it
as
as
the
others
you
as
well
able
to
judge
as
i
am
was
the
guarded
reply
any
one
can
see
for
himself
it
not
modern
rubbish
make
a
pretty
little
ornament
for
the
mantelpiece
remarked
a
wag
is
the
top
made
to
unscrew
or
what
sir
asked
a
third
seems
fixed
on
pretty
tight
i
ca
say
probably
it
has
not
been
removed
for
some
time
it
a
goodish
weight
said
the
chief
humorist
after
handling
it
what
inside
of
it
sir
sardines
i
do
represent
it
as
having
anything
inside
it
said
the
auctioneer
if
you
want
to
know
my
opinion
i
think
there
money
in
it
much
do
misunderstand
me
gentlemen
when
i
say
i
consider
there
money
in
it
i
not
alluding
to
its
contents
i
no
reason
to
believe
that
it
contains
anything
i
merely
suggesting
the
thing
itself
may
be
worth
more
than
it
looks
ah
it
might
be
without
itself
well
well
do
let
us
waste
time
look
upon
it
as
a
pure
speculation
and
make
me
an
offer
for
it
some
of
you
come
cried
the
comic
man
affecting
to
brace
himself
for
a
mighty
effort
pray
be
serious
gentlemen
we
want
to
get
on
you
know
anything
to
make
a
start
five
shillings
it
not
the
value
of
the
metal
but
take
the
bid
six
look
at
it
well
it
not
an
article
you
come
across
every
day
of
your
lives
the
bottle
was
still
being
passed
round
with
disrespectful
raps
and
slaps
and
it
had
now
come
to
ventimore
neighbour
who
scrutinised
it
carefully
but
made
no
bid
that
all
you
know
he
whispered
in
horace
ear
good
stuff
that
is
if
i
was
you
i
that
seven
shillings
eight
nine
bid
for
it
over
there
in
the
corner
said
the
auctioneer
if
you
think
it
so
good
why
do
you
have
it
yourself
horace
asked
his
neighbour
me
oh
well
it
ai
exactly
in
my
line
and
getting
this
last
lot
pretty
near
cleaned
me
out
i
done
for
i
all
the
same
it
is
a
curiosity
dunno
as
i
seen
a
brass
vawse
just
that
shape
before
and
it
genuine
old
though
all
these
fellers
are
too
ignorant
to
know
the
value
of
it
so
i
do
mind
giving
you
the
tip
horace
rose
the
better
to
examine
the
top
as
far
as
he
could
make
out
in
the
flickering
light
of
one
of
the
which
the
auctioneer
had
just
ordered
to
be
lit
there
were
scratches
and
triangular
marks
on
the
cap
that
might
possibly
be
an
inscription
if
so
might
there
not
be
the
means
here
of
regaining
the
favour
which
he
felt
that
as
it
was
he
should
probably
forfeit
justly
or
not
by
his
he
could
hardly
spend
the
professor
money
on
it
since
it
was
not
in
the
catalogue
and
he
had
no
authority
to
bid
for
it
but
he
had
a
few
shillings
of
his
own
to
spare
why
not
bid
for
it
on
his
own
account
as
long
as
he
could
afford
to
do
so
if
he
were
outbid
as
usual
it
would
not
particularly
matter
thirteen
shillings
the
auctioneer
was
saying
in
his
dispassionate
tones
horace
caught
his
eye
and
slightly
raised
his
catalogue
while
another
man
nodded
at
the
same
time
fourteen
in
two
places
horace
raised
his
catalogue
again
i
wo
go
beyond
fifteen
he
thought
fifteen
it
you
sir
any
advance
on
fifteen
sixteen
this
very
quaint
old
oriental
bottle
going
for
only
sixteen
shillings
after
all
thought
horace
i
do
mind
anything
under
a
pound
for
it
and
he
bid
seventeen
shillings
eighteen
cried
his
rival
a
short
cheery
little
dealer
whose
neighbours
adjured
him
to
sit
quiet
like
a
good
little
boy
and
not
waste
his
nineteen
said
horace
pound
answered
the
cherubic
man
a
pound
only
bid
for
this
grand
brass
vessel
said
the
auctioneer
indifferently
all
done
at
a
pound
horace
thought
another
shilling
or
two
would
not
ruin
him
and
nodded
a
guinea
for
the
last
time
you
it
sir
said
the
auctioneer
to
the
little
man
go
on
tommy
do
you
be
beat
spring
another
bob
on
it
tommy
his
friends
advised
him
ironically
but
tommy
shook
his
head
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
knows
when
to
draw
the
line
one
guinea
and
that
not
half
its
value
gentleman
on
my
left
said
the
auctioneer
more
in
sorrow
than
in
anger
and
the
brass
bottle
became
ventimore
property
he
paid
for
it
and
since
he
could
hardly
walk
home
nursing
a
large
metal
bottle
without
attracting
an
inconvenient
amount
of
attention
directed
that
it
should
be
sent
to
his
lodgings
at
vincent
square
but
when
he
was
out
in
the
fresh
air
walking
westward
to
his
club
he
found
himself
wondering
more
and
more
what
could
have
possessed
him
to
throw
away
a
guinea
when
he
had
few
enough
for
legitimate
expenses
on
an
article
of
such
exceedingly
problematical
value
chapter
iii
an
unexpected
opening
ventimore
made
his
way
to
cottesmore
gardens
that
evening
in
a
highly
inconsistent
not
to
say
chaotic
state
of
mind
the
thought
that
he
would
presently
see
sylvia
again
made
his
blood
course
quicker
while
he
was
fully
determined
to
say
no
more
to
her
than
civility
demanded
at
one
moment
he
was
blessing
professor
futvoye
for
his
happy
thought
in
making
use
of
him
at
another
he
was
bitterly
recognising
that
it
would
have
been
better
for
his
peace
of
mind
if
he
had
been
left
alone
sylvia
and
her
mother
had
no
desire
to
see
more
of
him
if
they
had
they
would
have
asked
him
to
come
before
this
no
doubt
they
would
tolerate
him
now
for
the
professor
sake
but
who
would
not
rather
be
ignored
than
tolerated
the
more
often
he
saw
sylvia
the
more
she
would
make
his
heart
ache
with
vain
longing
whereas
he
was
getting
almost
reconciled
to
her
indifference
he
would
very
soon
be
cured
if
he
did
see
her
why
he
see
her
he
need
not
go
in
at
all
he
had
merely
to
leave
the
catalogue
with
his
compliments
and
the
professor
would
learn
all
he
wanted
to
know
on
second
thoughts
he
must
go
in
if
only
to
return
the
but
he
would
ask
to
see
the
professor
in
private
most
probably
he
would
not
be
invited
to
join
his
wife
and
daughter
but
if
he
were
he
could
make
some
excuse
they
might
think
it
a
little
odd
a
little
discourteous
perhaps
but
they
would
be
too
relieved
to
care
much
about
that
when
he
got
to
cottesmore
gardens
and
was
actually
at
the
door
of
the
futvoyes
house
one
of
the
neatest
and
demurest
in
that
retired
and
irreproachable
quarter
he
began
to
feel
a
craven
hope
that
the
professor
might
be
out
in
which
case
he
need
only
leave
the
catalogue
and
write
a
letter
when
he
got
home
reporting
his
at
the
sale
and
returning
the
note
and
as
it
happened
the
professor
out
and
horace
was
not
so
glad
as
he
thought
he
should
be
the
maid
told
him
that
the
ladies
were
in
the
and
seemed
to
take
it
for
granted
that
he
was
coming
in
so
he
had
himself
announced
he
would
not
stay
long
just
long
enough
to
explain
his
business
there
and
make
it
clear
that
he
had
no
wish
to
force
his
acquaintance
upon
them
he
found
futvoye
in
the
farther
part
of
the
pretty
double
writing
letters
and
sylvia
more
dazzlingly
fair
than
ever
in
some
sort
of
gauzy
black
frock
with
a
heliotrope
sash
and
a
bunch
of
parma
violets
on
her
breast
was
comfortably
established
with
a
book
in
the
front
room
and
seemed
surprised
if
not
resentful
at
having
to
disturb
herself
i
must
apologise
he
began
with
an
involuntary
stiffness
for
calling
at
this
very
unceremonious
time
but
the
fact
is
the
professor
i
know
all
about
it
interrupted
futvoye
brusquely
while
her
shrewd
eyes
took
him
in
with
a
cool
stare
that
was
humorously
observant
without
being
aggressive
we
heard
how
shamefully
my
husband
abused
your
really
it
was
too
bad
of
him
to
ask
a
busy
man
like
you
to
put
aside
his
work
and
go
and
spend
a
whole
day
at
that
stupid
auction
oh
i
nothing
particular
to
do
i
ca
call
myself
a
busy
man
unfortunately
said
horace
with
that
frankness
which
scorns
to
conceal
what
other
people
know
perfectly
well
already
ah
well
it
very
nice
of
you
to
make
light
of
it
but
he
ought
not
to
have
done
it
after
so
short
an
acquaintance
too
and
to
make
it
worse
he
has
had
to
go
out
unexpectedly
this
evening
but
he
be
back
before
very
long
if
you
do
mind
waiting
there
really
no
need
to
wait
said
horace
because
this
catalogue
will
tell
him
everything
and
as
the
particular
things
he
wanted
went
for
much
more
than
he
thought
i
was
able
to
get
any
of
them
i
sure
i
very
glad
of
it
said
futvoye
for
his
study
is
crammed
with
odds
and
ends
as
it
is
and
i
do
want
the
whole
house
to
look
like
a
museum
or
an
antiquity
shop
i
all
the
trouble
in
the
world
to
persuade
him
that
a
great
gaudy
gilded
was
not
quite
the
thing
for
a
but
please
sit
down
mr
ventimore
thanks
stammered
horace
but
but
i
must
stay
if
you
will
tell
the
professor
how
sorry
i
was
to
miss
him
and
and
give
him
back
this
note
which
he
left
with
me
to
cover
any
deposit
i
i
wo
interrupt
you
any
longer
he
was
as
a
rule
imperturbable
in
most
social
emergencies
but
just
now
he
was
seized
with
a
wild
desire
to
escape
which
to
his
infinite
mortification
made
him
behave
like
a
shy
schoolboy
nonsense
said
futvoye
i
am
sure
my
husband
would
be
most
annoyed
if
we
did
keep
you
till
he
came
i
really
ought
to
go
he
declared
wistfully
enough
we
must
tease
ventimore
to
stay
mother
when
he
so
evidently
wants
to
go
said
sylvia
cruelly
well
i
wo
detain
you
at
least
not
long
i
wonder
if
you
would
mind
posting
a
letter
for
me
as
you
pass
the
i
almost
finished
it
and
it
ought
to
go
and
my
maid
jessie
has
such
a
bad
cold
i
really
do
like
sending
her
out
with
it
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
refuse
to
stay
after
that
even
if
he
had
wished
it
would
only
be
for
a
few
minutes
sylvia
might
spare
him
that
much
of
her
time
he
should
not
trouble
her
again
so
futvoye
went
back
to
her
bureau
and
sylvia
and
he
were
practically
alone
she
had
taken
a
seat
not
far
from
his
and
made
a
few
constrained
remarks
obviously
out
of
sheer
civility
he
returned
mechanical
replies
with
a
dreary
wonder
whether
this
could
really
be
the
girl
who
had
talked
to
him
with
such
charming
friendliness
and
confidence
only
a
few
weeks
ago
in
normandy
and
the
worst
of
it
was
she
was
looking
more
bewitching
than
ever
her
slim
arms
gleaming
through
the
black
lace
of
her
sleeves
and
the
gold
threads
in
her
soft
masses
of
chestnut
hair
sparkling
in
the
light
of
the
shaded
lamp
behind
her
the
slight
contraction
of
her
eyebrows
and
the
mutinous
downward
curve
of
her
mouth
seemed
expressive
of
boredom
what
a
dreadfully
long
time
mamma
is
over
that
letter
she
said
at
last
i
think
i
better
go
and
hurry
her
up
please
do
unless
you
are
particularly
anxious
to
get
rid
of
me
i
thought
you
seemed
particularly
anxious
to
escape
she
said
coldly
and
as
a
family
we
have
certainly
taken
up
quite
enough
of
your
time
for
one
day
that
is
not
the
way
you
used
to
talk
at
st
luc
he
said
at
luc
perhaps
not
but
in
london
everything
is
so
different
you
see
very
different
when
one
meets
people
abroad
who
who
seem
at
all
inclined
to
be
sociable
she
continued
one
is
so
apt
to
think
them
pleasanter
than
they
really
are
then
one
meets
them
again
and
and
wonders
what
one
ever
saw
to
like
in
them
and
it
no
use
pretending
one
feels
the
same
because
they
generally
understand
sooner
or
later
do
you
find
that
i
do
indeed
he
said
wincing
though
i
do
know
what
i
done
to
deserve
that
you
should
tell
me
so
oh
i
was
not
blaming
you
you
have
been
most
angelic
i
ca
think
how
papa
could
have
expected
you
to
take
all
that
trouble
for
him
still
you
did
though
you
must
have
simply
hated
it
but
good
heavens
do
you
know
i
should
be
only
too
delighted
to
be
of
the
least
service
to
him
or
to
any
of
you
you
looked
anything
but
delighted
when
you
came
in
just
now
you
looked
as
if
your
one
idea
was
to
get
it
over
as
soon
as
you
could
you
know
perfectly
well
you
longing
now
for
mother
to
finish
her
letter
and
set
you
free
do
you
really
think
i
ca
see
that
if
all
that
is
true
or
partly
true
said
horace
ca
you
guess
why
i
guessed
how
it
was
when
you
called
here
first
that
afternoon
mamma
had
asked
you
to
and
you
thought
you
might
as
well
be
civil
perhaps
you
really
did
think
it
would
be
pleasant
to
see
us
again
but
it
the
same
thing
oh
i
saw
it
in
your
face
directly
you
became
conventional
and
distant
and
horrid
and
it
made
me
horrid
too
and
you
went
away
determined
that
you
would
see
any
more
of
us
than
you
could
help
that
why
i
was
so
furious
when
i
heard
that
papa
had
been
to
see
you
and
with
such
an
object
all
this
was
so
near
the
truth
and
yet
missed
it
with
such
perverse
ingenuity
that
horace
felt
bound
to
put
himself
right
perhaps
i
ought
to
leave
things
as
they
are
he
said
but
i
ca
it
no
earthly
use
i
know
but
may
i
tell
you
why
it
really
was
painful
to
me
to
meet
you
again
i
thought
were
changed
that
you
wished
to
forget
and
wished
me
to
forget
only
i
ca
that
we
had
been
friends
for
a
short
time
and
though
i
never
blamed
you
it
was
natural
enough
it
hit
me
pretty
hard
so
hard
that
i
did
feel
anxious
to
repeat
the
experience
did
it
hit
you
hard
said
sylvia
softly
perhaps
i
minded
too
just
a
very
little
however
she
added
with
a
sudden
smile
that
made
two
enchanting
dimples
in
her
cheeks
it
only
shows
how
much
more
sensible
it
is
to
have
things
out
perhaps
you
wo
persist
in
keeping
away
from
us
i
believe
said
horace
gloomily
still
determined
not
to
let
any
direct
avowal
pass
his
lips
it
would
be
best
that
i
keep
away
her
eyes
shone
through
their
long
lashes
the
violets
on
her
breast
rose
and
fell
i
do
think
i
understand
she
said
in
a
tone
that
was
both
hurt
and
offended
there
is
a
pleasure
in
yielding
to
some
temptations
that
more
than
compensates
for
the
pain
of
any
previous
resistance
come
what
might
he
was
not
going
to
be
misunderstood
any
longer
if
i
must
tell
you
he
said
i
fallen
desperately
hopelessly
in
love
with
you
now
you
know
the
reason
it
does
seem
a
very
good
reason
for
wanting
to
go
away
and
never
see
me
again
it
not
when
i
no
right
to
speak
to
you
of
love
but
you
done
that
i
know
he
said
penitently
i
could
help
it
but
i
never
meant
to
it
slipped
out
i
quite
understand
how
hopeless
it
is
of
course
if
you
are
so
sure
as
all
that
you
are
quite
right
not
to
try
sylvia
you
ca
mean
that
that
you
do
care
after
all
did
you
really
see
she
said
with
a
low
happy
laugh
how
stupid
of
you
and
how
dear
he
caught
her
hand
which
she
allowed
to
rest
contentedly
in
his
oh
sylvia
then
you
do
you
do
but
my
god
what
a
selfish
brute
i
am
for
we
ca
marry
it
may
be
years
before
i
can
ask
you
to
come
to
me
you
father
and
mother
would
hear
of
your
being
engaged
to
me
they
hear
of
it
just
yet
horace
yes
they
must
i
should
feel
a
cur
if
i
did
tell
your
mother
at
all
events
then
you
sha
feel
a
cur
for
we
go
and
tell
her
together
and
sylvia
rose
and
went
into
the
farther
room
and
put
her
arms
round
her
mother
neck
mother
darling
she
said
in
a
half
whisper
really
all
your
fault
for
writing
such
very
long
letters
but
but
we
do
exactly
know
how
we
came
to
do
it
but
horace
and
i
have
got
engaged
somehow
you
are
angry
are
you
i
think
you
both
extremely
foolish
said
futvoye
as
she
extricated
herself
from
sylvia
arms
and
turned
to
face
horace
from
all
i
hear
ventimore
you
not
in
a
position
to
marry
at
present
unfortunately
no
said
horace
i
making
nothing
as
yet
but
my
chance
must
come
some
day
i
do
ask
you
to
give
me
sylvia
till
then
and
you
know
you
like
horace
mother
pleaded
sylvia
and
i
ready
to
wait
for
him
any
time
nothing
will
induce
me
to
give
him
up
and
i
shall
never
never
care
for
anybody
else
so
you
see
you
may
just
as
well
give
us
your
consent
i
afraid
i
been
to
blame
said
futvoye
i
ought
to
have
foreseen
this
at
luc
sylvia
is
our
only
child
ventimore
and
i
would
far
rather
see
her
happily
married
than
making
what
is
called
a
match
still
this
really
does
seem
hopeless
i
am
quite
sure
her
father
would
never
approve
of
it
indeed
it
must
not
be
mentioned
to
him
he
would
only
be
irritated
so
long
as
you
are
not
against
us
said
horace
you
wo
forbid
me
to
see
her
i
believe
i
ought
to
said
futvoye
but
i
do
object
to
your
coming
here
occasionally
as
an
ordinary
visitor
only
understand
this
until
you
can
prove
to
my
husband
satisfaction
that
you
are
able
to
support
sylvia
in
the
manner
she
has
been
accustomed
to
there
must
be
no
formal
engagement
i
think
i
am
entitled
to
ask
of
you
she
was
so
clearly
within
her
rights
and
so
much
more
indulgent
than
horace
had
expected
for
he
had
always
considered
her
an
unsentimental
and
rather
worldly
woman
that
he
accepted
her
conditions
almost
gratefully
after
all
it
was
enough
for
him
that
sylvia
returned
his
love
and
that
he
should
be
allowed
to
see
her
from
time
to
time
it
rather
a
pity
said
sylvia
meditatively
a
little
later
when
her
mother
had
gone
back
to
her
and
she
and
horace
were
discussing
the
future
it
rather
a
pity
that
you
did
manage
to
get
at
that
sale
it
might
have
helped
you
with
papa
well
i
did
get
something
on
my
own
account
he
said
though
i
know
whether
it
is
likely
to
do
me
any
good
with
your
father
and
he
told
her
how
he
had
come
to
acquire
the
brass
bottle
and
you
actually
gave
a
guinea
for
it
said
sylvia
when
you
could
probably
get
exactly
the
same
thing
only
better
at
liberty
for
about
nothing
of
that
sort
has
any
charms
for
papa
unless
it
dirty
and
dingy
and
centuries
old
this
looks
all
that
i
only
bought
it
because
though
it
was
down
on
the
catalogue
i
had
a
fancy
that
it
might
interest
the
professor
oh
cried
sylvia
clasping
her
pretty
hands
if
only
it
does
horace
if
it
turns
out
to
be
tremendously
rare
and
valuable
i
do
believe
dad
would
be
so
delighted
that
he
consent
to
anything
ah
that
his
step
outside
he
letting
himself
in
now
mind
you
do
forget
to
tell
him
about
that
bottle
the
professor
did
not
seem
in
the
sweetest
of
humours
as
he
entered
the
sorry
i
was
obliged
to
be
from
home
and
there
was
nobody
but
my
wife
and
daughter
here
to
entertain
you
but
i
am
glad
you
stayed
yes
i
rather
glad
you
stayed
so
am
i
sir
said
horace
and
proceeded
to
give
his
account
of
the
sale
which
did
not
serve
to
improve
the
professor
temper
he
thrust
out
his
under
lip
at
certain
items
in
the
catalogue
i
wish
i
gone
myself
he
said
that
bowl
a
really
fine
example
of
persian
work
going
for
only
five
guineas
i
willingly
have
given
ten
for
it
there
there
i
thought
i
could
have
depended
on
you
to
use
your
judgment
better
than
that
if
you
remember
sir
you
strictly
limited
me
to
the
sums
you
marked
nothing
of
the
sort
said
the
professor
testily
my
marginal
notes
were
merely
intended
as
indications
no
more
you
might
have
known
that
if
you
had
secured
one
of
the
things
at
any
price
i
should
have
approved
horace
had
no
grounds
for
knowing
anything
of
the
kind
and
much
reason
for
believing
the
contrary
but
he
saw
no
use
in
arguing
the
matter
further
and
merely
said
he
was
sorry
to
have
misunderstood
no
doubt
the
fault
was
mine
said
the
professor
in
a
tone
that
implied
the
opposite
still
making
every
allowance
for
inexperience
in
these
matters
i
should
have
thought
it
impossible
for
any
one
to
spend
a
whole
day
bidding
at
a
place
like
hammond
without
even
securing
a
single
article
but
dad
put
in
sylvia
ventimore
did
get
thing
on
his
own
account
it
a
brass
bottle
not
down
in
the
catalogue
but
he
thinks
it
may
be
worth
something
perhaps
and
he
very
much
like
to
have
your
opinion
tchah
said
the
professor
some
modern
bazaar
work
most
probably
he
better
have
kept
his
money
what
was
this
bottle
of
yours
like
now
eh
horace
described
it
h
seems
to
be
what
the
arabs
call
a
probably
used
as
a
sprinkler
or
to
hold
hundreds
of
about
commented
the
professor
crustily
it
had
a
lid
riveted
or
soldered
on
said
horace
the
general
shape
was
something
like
this
and
he
made
a
rapid
sketch
from
memory
which
the
professor
took
reluctantly
and
then
adjusted
his
glasses
with
some
increase
of
interest
ha
the
form
is
antique
certainly
and
the
top
hermetically
fastened
eh
that
looks
as
if
it
might
contain
something
you
do
think
it
has
a
genie
inside
like
the
sealed
jar
the
fisherman
found
in
the
nights
cried
sylvia
what
fun
if
it
had
by
genie
i
presume
you
mean
a
which
is
the
more
correct
and
scholarly
term
said
the
professor
female
and
plural
no
i
do
contemplate
that
as
a
probable
contingency
but
it
is
not
quite
impossible
that
a
vessel
closed
as
ventimore
describes
may
have
been
designed
as
a
receptacle
for
papyri
or
other
records
of
archæological
interest
which
may
be
still
in
preservation
i
should
recommend
you
sir
to
use
the
greatest
precaution
in
removing
the
lid
do
expose
the
documents
if
any
too
suddenly
to
the
outer
air
and
it
would
be
better
if
you
did
not
handle
them
yourself
i
shall
be
rather
curious
to
hear
whether
it
really
does
contain
anything
and
if
so
what
i
will
open
it
as
carefully
as
possible
said
horace
and
whatever
it
may
contain
you
may
rely
upon
my
letting
you
know
at
once
he
left
shortly
afterwards
encouraged
by
the
radiant
trust
in
eyes
and
thrilled
by
the
secret
pressure
of
her
hand
at
parting
he
had
been
amply
repaid
for
all
the
hours
he
had
spent
in
the
close
his
luck
had
turned
at
last
he
was
going
to
succeed
he
felt
it
in
the
air
as
if
he
were
already
fanned
by
fortune
pinions
still
thinking
of
sylvia
he
let
himself
into
the
house
on
the
north
side
of
vincent
square
where
he
had
lodged
for
some
years
it
was
nearly
twelve
and
his
landlady
rapkin
and
her
husband
had
already
gone
to
bed
ventimore
went
up
to
his
a
comfortable
apartment
with
two
long
windows
opening
on
to
a
trellised
verandah
and
balcony
a
room
which
as
he
had
furnished
and
decorated
it
himself
to
suit
his
own
tastes
had
none
of
the
depressing
ugliness
of
typical
lodgings
it
was
quite
dark
for
the
season
was
too
mild
for
a
fire
and
he
had
to
grope
for
the
matches
before
he
could
light
his
lamp
after
he
had
done
so
and
turned
up
the
wicks
the
first
object
he
saw
was
the
bulbous
jar
which
he
had
bought
that
afternoon
and
which
now
stood
on
the
stained
boards
near
the
mantelpiece
it
had
been
delivered
with
unusual
promptitude
somehow
he
felt
a
sort
of
repulsion
at
the
sight
of
it
it
a
object
than
i
thought
he
said
to
himself
disgustedly
a
would
be
about
as
decorative
and
appropriate
in
my
room
what
a
thundering
ass
i
was
to
waste
a
guinea
on
it
i
wonder
if
there
really
is
anything
inside
it
it
is
so
infernally
ugly
that
it
to
be
useful
the
professor
seemed
to
fancy
it
might
hold
documents
and
he
ought
to
know
anyway
i
find
out
before
i
turn
in
he
grasped
it
by
its
long
thick
neck
and
tried
to
twist
the
cap
off
but
it
remained
firm
which
was
not
surprising
seeing
that
it
was
thickly
coated
with
a
crust
i
must
get
some
of
that
off
first
and
then
try
again
he
decided
and
after
foraging
downstairs
he
returned
with
a
hammer
and
chisel
with
which
he
chipped
away
the
crust
till
the
line
of
the
cap
was
revealed
and
an
uncouth
metal
knob
that
seemed
to
be
a
catch
this
he
tapped
sharply
for
some
time
and
again
attempted
to
wrench
off
the
lid
then
he
gripped
the
vessel
between
his
knees
and
put
forth
all
his
strength
while
the
bottle
seemed
to
rock
and
heave
under
him
in
sympathy
the
cap
was
beginning
to
give
way
very
slightly
one
last
wrench
and
it
came
off
in
his
hand
with
such
suddenness
that
he
was
flung
violently
backwards
and
hit
the
back
of
his
head
smartly
against
an
angle
of
the
wainscot
he
had
a
vague
impression
of
the
bottle
lying
on
its
side
with
dense
volumes
of
hissing
black
smoke
pouring
out
of
its
mouth
and
towering
up
in
a
gigantic
column
to
the
ceiling
he
was
conscious
too
of
a
pungent
and
peculiarly
overpowering
perfume
i
got
hold
of
some
sort
of
infernal
machine
he
thought
and
i
shall
be
all
over
the
square
in
less
than
a
second
and
just
as
he
arrived
at
this
cheerful
conclusion
he
lost
consciousness
altogether
he
could
not
have
been
unconscious
for
more
than
a
few
seconds
for
when
he
opened
his
eyes
the
room
was
still
thick
with
smoke
through
which
he
dimly
discerned
the
figure
of
a
stranger
who
seemed
of
abnormal
and
almost
colossal
height
but
this
must
have
been
an
optical
illusion
caused
by
the
magnifying
effects
of
the
smoke
for
as
it
cleared
his
visitor
proved
to
be
of
no
more
than
ordinary
stature
he
was
elderly
and
indeed
venerable
of
appearance
and
wore
an
eastern
robe
and
of
a
hue
he
stood
there
with
uplifted
hands
uttering
something
in
a
loud
tone
and
a
language
unknown
to
horace
ventimore
being
still
somewhat
dazed
felt
no
surprise
at
seeing
him
rapkin
must
have
let
her
second
floor
at
last
to
some
oriental
he
would
have
preferred
an
englishman
as
a
but
this
foreigner
must
have
noticed
the
smoke
and
rushed
in
to
offer
assistance
which
was
both
neighbourly
and
plucky
of
him
awfully
good
of
you
to
come
in
sir
he
said
as
he
scrambled
to
his
feet
i
do
know
what
happened
exactly
but
there
no
harm
done
i
only
a
trifle
shaken
that
all
by
the
way
i
suppose
you
can
speak
english
assuredly
i
can
speak
so
as
to
be
understood
by
all
whom
i
address
answered
the
stranger
dost
thou
not
understand
my
speech
perfectly
now
said
horace
but
you
made
a
remark
just
now
which
i
did
follow
would
you
mind
repeating
it
i
said
o
prophet
of
god
i
will
not
return
to
the
like
conduct
ever
ah
said
horace
i
dare
say
you
rather
startled
so
was
i
when
i
opened
that
bottle
tell
me
was
it
indeed
thy
hand
that
removed
the
seal
o
young
man
of
kindness
and
good
works
i
certainly
did
open
it
said
ventimore
though
i
do
know
where
the
kindness
comes
in
for
i
no
notion
what
was
inside
the
thing
i
was
inside
it
said
the
stranger
calmly
chapter
iv
at
large
so
were
inside
that
bottle
were
you
said
horace
blandly
how
singular
he
began
to
realise
that
he
had
to
deal
with
an
oriental
lunatic
and
must
humour
him
to
some
extent
fortunately
he
did
not
seem
at
all
dangerous
though
undeniably
his
hair
fell
in
disorderly
profusion
from
under
his
high
turban
about
his
cheeks
which
were
of
a
uniform
pale
rhubarb
tint
his
grey
beard
streamed
out
in
three
thin
strands
and
his
long
narrow
eyes
opal
in
hue
and
set
rather
wide
apart
and
at
a
slight
angle
had
a
curious
expression
part
slyness
and
part
childlike
simplicity
dost
thou
doubt
that
i
speak
truth
i
tell
thee
that
i
have
been
confined
in
that
accursed
vessel
for
countless
centuries
how
long
i
know
not
for
it
is
beyond
calculation
i
should
hardly
have
thought
from
your
appearance
sir
that
you
had
been
so
many
years
in
bottle
as
all
that
said
horace
politely
but
it
certainly
time
you
had
a
change
may
i
if
it
is
indiscreet
ask
how
you
came
into
such
a
very
uncomfortable
position
but
probably
you
have
forgotten
by
this
time
forgotten
said
the
other
with
a
sombre
red
glow
in
his
opal
eyes
wisely
was
it
written
him
that
desireth
oblivion
confer
benefits
but
the
memory
of
an
injury
endureth
for
ever
forget
neither
benefits
nor
injuries
an
old
gentleman
with
a
grievance
thought
ventimore
and
mad
into
the
bargain
nice
person
to
have
staying
in
the
same
house
with
one
know
o
best
of
mankind
continued
the
stranger
that
he
who
now
addresses
thee
is
one
of
the
green
jinn
and
i
dwelt
in
the
palace
of
the
mountain
of
the
clouds
above
the
city
of
babel
in
the
garden
of
irem
which
thou
doubtless
knowest
by
repute
i
fancy
i
heard
of
it
said
horace
as
if
it
were
an
address
in
the
court
directory
delightful
neighbourhood
i
had
a
kinswoman
who
possessed
incomparable
beauty
and
manifold
accomplishments
and
seeing
that
though
a
jinneeyeh
she
was
of
the
believing
jinn
i
despatched
messengers
to
suleyman
the
great
the
son
of
daood
offering
him
her
hand
in
marriage
but
a
certain
jarjarees
the
son
of
rejmoos
the
son
of
iblees
may
he
be
for
ever
accursed
looked
with
favour
upon
the
maiden
and
going
secretly
unto
suleyman
persuaded
him
that
i
was
preparing
a
crafty
snare
for
the
king
undoing
and
of
course
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
said
ventimore
by
a
venomous
tongue
the
fairest
motives
may
be
rendered
foul
was
the
somewhat
evasive
reply
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
suleyman
on
whom
be
peace
listened
unto
the
voice
of
jarjarees
and
refused
to
receive
the
maiden
moreover
he
commanded
that
i
should
be
seized
and
imprisoned
in
a
bottle
of
brass
and
cast
into
the
sea
of
there
to
abide
the
day
of
doom
too
bad
really
too
bad
murmured
horace
in
a
tone
that
he
could
only
hope
was
sufficiently
sympathetic
but
now
by
thy
means
o
thou
of
noble
ancestors
and
gentle
disposition
my
deliverance
hath
been
accomplished
and
if
i
were
to
serve
thee
for
a
thousand
years
regarding
nothing
else
even
thus
could
i
not
requite
thee
and
my
so
doing
would
be
a
small
thing
according
to
thy
desserts
pray
do
mention
it
said
horace
only
too
pleased
if
i
been
of
any
use
to
you
in
the
sky
it
is
written
upon
the
pages
of
the
air
who
doth
kind
actions
shall
experience
the
like
am
i
not
an
efreet
of
the
jinn
demand
therefore
and
thou
shalt
receive
poor
old
chap
thought
horace
he
very
cracked
indeed
he
be
wanting
to
give
me
a
present
of
some
sort
soon
and
of
course
i
have
that
my
dear
fakrash
he
said
aloud
i
done
nothing
nothing
at
all
and
if
i
had
i
could
possibly
accept
any
reward
for
it
what
are
thy
names
and
what
calling
dost
thou
follow
i
ought
to
have
introduced
myself
before
let
me
give
you
my
card
and
ventimore
gave
him
one
which
the
other
took
and
placed
in
his
girdle
that
my
business
address
i
an
architect
if
you
know
what
that
is
a
man
who
builds
houses
and
churches
mosques
you
know
in
fact
anything
when
he
can
get
it
to
build
a
useful
calling
indeed
and
one
to
be
rewarded
with
fine
gold
in
my
case
horace
confessed
the
reward
has
been
too
fine
to
be
perceived
in
other
words
i
never
rewarded
because
never
yet
had
the
luck
to
get
a
client
and
what
is
this
client
of
whom
thou
speakest
oh
well
some
merchant
who
wants
a
house
built
for
him
and
does
care
how
much
he
spends
on
it
there
must
be
lots
of
them
about
but
they
never
seem
to
come
in
direction
grant
me
a
period
of
delay
and
if
it
be
possible
i
will
procure
thee
such
a
client
horace
could
not
help
thinking
that
any
recommendation
from
such
a
quarter
would
hardly
carry
much
weight
but
as
the
poor
old
man
evidently
imagined
himself
under
an
obligation
which
he
was
anxious
to
discharge
it
would
have
been
unkind
to
throw
cold
water
on
his
good
intentions
my
dear
sir
he
said
lightly
if
you
come
across
that
particular
type
of
client
and
can
contrive
to
impress
him
with
the
belief
that
i
just
the
architect
he
looking
out
for
which
between
ourselves
i
am
though
nobody
discovered
it
yet
if
you
can
get
him
to
come
to
me
you
will
do
me
the
very
greatest
service
i
could
ever
hope
for
but
do
give
yourself
any
trouble
over
it
it
will
be
one
of
the
easiest
things
that
can
be
said
his
visitor
that
is
and
here
a
shade
of
rather
pathetic
doubt
crossed
his
face
provided
that
anything
of
my
former
power
yet
remains
unto
me
well
never
mind
sir
said
horace
if
you
ca
i
shall
take
the
will
for
the
deed
first
of
all
it
will
be
prudent
to
learn
where
suleyman
is
that
i
may
humble
myself
before
him
and
make
my
peace
yes
said
horace
gently
i
would
i
should
make
a
point
of
that
sir
not
you
know
he
might
be
in
bed
morning
this
is
a
strange
place
that
i
am
in
and
i
know
not
yet
in
what
direction
i
should
seek
him
but
till
i
have
found
him
and
justified
myself
in
his
sight
and
had
my
revenge
upon
jarjarees
mine
enemy
i
shall
know
no
rest
well
but
go
to
bed
now
like
a
sensible
old
chap
said
horace
soothingly
anxious
to
prevent
this
poor
demented
asiatic
from
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
police
plenty
of
time
to
go
and
call
on
suleyman
i
will
search
for
him
even
unto
the
uttermost
ends
of
the
earth
that
right
you
sure
to
find
him
in
one
of
them
only
do
you
see
it
no
use
starting
the
last
trains
have
gone
long
ago
as
he
spoke
the
night
wind
bore
across
the
square
the
sound
of
big
ben
striking
the
quarters
in
westminster
clock
tower
and
then
after
a
pause
the
solemn
boom
that
announced
the
first
of
the
small
hours
thought
ventimore
i
speak
to
rapkin
and
get
her
to
send
for
a
doctor
and
have
him
put
under
proper
care
the
poor
old
boy
really
is
fit
to
go
about
alone
i
will
start
now
at
once
insisted
the
stranger
for
there
is
no
time
to
be
lost
oh
come
said
horace
after
so
many
thousand
years
a
few
hours
more
or
less
wo
make
any
serious
difference
and
you
go
out
now
they
shut
up
the
house
do
let
me
take
you
upstairs
to
your
room
sir
not
so
for
i
must
leave
thee
for
a
season
o
young
man
of
kind
conduct
but
may
thy
days
be
fortunate
and
the
gate
never
cease
to
be
repaired
and
the
nose
of
him
that
envieth
thee
be
rubbed
in
the
dust
for
love
for
thee
hath
entered
into
my
heart
and
if
it
be
permitted
unto
me
i
will
cover
thee
with
the
veils
of
my
protection
as
he
finished
this
harangue
the
speaker
seemed
to
speechless
amazement
to
slip
through
the
wall
behind
him
at
all
events
he
had
left
the
room
somehow
and
horace
found
himself
alone
he
rubbed
the
back
of
his
head
which
began
to
be
painful
he
really
have
vanished
through
the
wall
he
said
to
himself
that
too
absurd
the
fact
is
i
this
evening
and
no
wonder
after
all
that
happened
the
best
thing
i
can
do
is
to
go
to
bed
at
once
which
he
accordingly
proceeded
to
do
chapter
v
carte
blanche
when
ventimore
woke
next
morning
his
headache
had
gone
and
with
it
the
recollection
of
everything
but
the
wondrous
and
delightful
fact
that
sylvia
loved
him
and
had
promised
to
be
his
some
day
her
mother
too
was
on
his
side
why
should
he
despair
of
anything
after
that
there
was
the
professor
to
be
sure
but
even
he
might
be
brought
to
consent
to
an
engagement
especially
if
it
turned
out
that
the
brass
bottle
and
here
horace
began
to
recall
an
extraordinary
dream
in
connection
with
that
extremely
speculative
purchase
of
his
he
had
dreamed
that
he
had
forced
the
bottle
open
and
that
it
proved
to
contain
not
manuscripts
but
an
elderly
jinnee
who
alleged
that
he
had
been
imprisoned
there
by
the
order
of
king
solomon
what
he
wondered
could
have
put
so
grotesque
a
fancy
into
his
head
and
then
he
smiled
as
he
traced
it
to
sylvia
playful
suggestion
that
the
bottle
might
contain
a
genie
as
did
the
famous
jar
in
the
arabian
nights
and
to
her
father
pedantic
correction
of
the
word
to
jinnee
upon
that
slight
foundation
his
sleeping
brain
had
built
up
all
that
elaborate
fabric
a
scene
so
vivid
and
a
story
so
circumstantial
and
plausible
that
in
spite
of
its
extravagance
he
could
hardly
even
now
persuade
himself
that
it
was
entirely
imaginary
the
psychology
of
dreams
is
a
subject
which
has
a
fascinating
mystery
even
for
the
least
serious
student
as
he
entered
the
where
his
breakfast
awaited
him
he
looked
round
half
expecting
to
find
the
bottle
lying
with
its
lid
off
in
the
corner
as
he
had
last
seen
it
in
his
dream
of
course
it
was
not
there
and
he
felt
an
odd
relief
the
people
had
not
delivered
it
yet
and
so
much
the
better
for
he
had
still
to
ascertain
if
it
had
anything
inside
it
and
who
knew
that
it
might
not
contain
something
more
to
his
advantage
than
a
maundering
old
jinnee
with
a
grievance
several
thousands
of
years
old
breakfast
over
he
rang
for
his
landlady
who
presently
appeared
rapkin
was
a
superior
type
of
her
class
she
was
scrupulously
clean
and
neat
in
her
person
her
sandy
hair
was
so
smooth
and
tightly
knotted
that
it
gave
her
head
the
colour
and
shape
of
a
barcelona
nut
she
had
sharp
beady
eyes
nostrils
that
seemed
to
smell
battle
afar
off
a
wide
thin
mouth
that
apparently
closed
with
a
snap
and
a
dry
complexion
suggestive
of
bran
but
if
somewhat
grim
of
aspect
she
was
a
good
soul
and
devoted
to
horace
in
whom
she
took
almost
a
maternal
interest
while
regretting
that
he
was
not
what
she
called
enough
to
get
on
in
the
world
rapkin
had
wooed
and
married
her
when
they
were
both
in
service
and
he
still
took
occasional
jobs
as
an
outdoor
butler
though
horace
suspected
that
his
more
staple
form
of
industry
was
the
consumption
of
and
remarkably
cigars
in
the
basement
parlour
shall
you
be
dining
in
this
evening
sir
inquired
rapkin
i
do
know
do
get
anything
in
for
me
i
shall
most
probably
dine
at
the
club
said
horace
and
rapkin
who
had
a
confirmed
belief
that
all
clubs
were
hotbeds
of
vice
and
extravagance
sniffed
disapproval
by
the
way
he
added
if
a
kind
of
brass
pot
is
sent
here
it
all
right
i
bought
it
at
a
sale
yesterday
be
careful
how
you
handle
it
it
rather
old
there
a
vawse
come
late
last
night
sir
i
do
know
if
that
it
enough
then
will
you
bring
it
up
at
once
please
i
want
to
see
it
rapkin
retired
to
reappear
presently
with
the
brass
bottle
i
thought
you
have
noticed
it
when
you
come
in
last
night
sir
she
explained
for
i
stood
it
in
the
corner
and
when
i
see
it
this
morning
it
was
layin
o
one
side
and
looking
that
dirty
and
disrespectable
i
took
it
down
to
give
it
a
good
clean
which
it
wanted
it
it
certainly
looked
rather
the
better
for
it
and
the
marks
or
scratches
on
the
cap
were
more
distinguishable
but
horace
was
somewhat
disconcerted
to
find
that
part
of
his
dream
was
true
the
bottle
had
been
there
i
hope
i
done
nothing
wrong
said
rapkin
observing
his
expression
i
only
used
a
little
warm
ale
to
it
which
is
a
capital
thing
for
and
gave
it
a
scrub
with
soap
but
it
would
take
more
than
that
to
get
all
the
muck
off
of
it
it
is
all
right
so
long
as
you
did
try
to
get
the
top
off
said
horace
why
the
top
off
it
sir
i
thought
you
done
it
with
the
and
chisel
when
you
got
said
his
landlady
staring
i
found
them
on
the
carpet
horace
started
then
part
was
true
too
oh
ah
he
said
i
believe
i
did
i
forgotten
that
reminds
me
have
you
let
the
room
above
to
to
an
oriental
gentleman
a
native
you
know
wears
a
green
turban
that
i
most
certainly
ventimore
said
rapkin
with
emphasis
nor
would
not
if
his
turbin
was
all
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
for
i
do
with
such
why
there
was
rapkin
own
let
her
parlour
floor
to
a
horiental
a
parsee
was
or
o
them
hafrican
tribes
and
reason
she
to
repent
of
it
for
all
his
gold
spectacles
whatever
made
you
fancy
i
should
let
to
a
blackamoor
oh
i
thought
i
saw
somebody
about
er
answering
that
description
and
i
wondered
if
never
in
sir
steggars
next
door
but
one
might
let
to
such
for
all
i
can
say
to
the
contrary
not
being
what
you
might
call
particular
and
her
rooms
more
suitable
to
savage
notions
but
enough
on
hands
ventimore
attending
to
you
not
keeping
a
girl
to
do
the
waiting
as
why
should
i
while
i
well
able
to
do
it
better
myself
as
soon
as
she
relieved
him
of
her
presence
he
examined
the
bottle
there
was
nothing
whatever
inside
it
which
disposed
of
all
the
hopes
he
had
entertained
from
that
quarter
it
was
not
difficult
to
account
for
the
visionary
oriental
as
an
hallucination
probably
inspired
by
the
heavy
fumes
for
he
now
believed
in
the
fumes
which
had
doubtless
resulted
from
the
rapid
decomposition
of
some
spices
or
similar
substances
suddenly
exposed
to
the
air
if
any
further
explanation
were
needed
the
accidental
blow
to
the
back
of
his
head
together
with
the
latent
suggestion
from
the
arabian
nights
would
amply
provide
it
so
having
settled
these
points
to
his
entire
satisfaction
he
went
to
his
office
in
great
cloister
street
which
he
now
had
entirely
to
himself
and
was
soon
engaged
in
drafting
the
specification
for
beevor
on
which
he
had
been
working
when
so
fortunately
interrupted
the
day
before
by
the
professor
the
work
was
more
or
less
mechanical
and
could
bring
him
no
credit
and
little
thanks
but
horace
had
the
happy
faculty
of
doing
thoroughly
whatever
he
undertook
and
as
he
sat
there
by
his
window
he
soon
became
entirely
oblivious
of
all
but
the
task
before
him
so
much
so
that
even
when
the
light
became
obscured
for
a
moment
as
if
by
some
large
and
opaque
body
in
passing
he
did
not
look
up
immediately
and
when
he
did
was
surprised
to
find
the
only
armchair
occupied
by
a
portly
person
who
seemed
to
be
trying
to
recover
his
breath
i
beg
your
pardon
said
ventimore
i
never
heard
you
come
in
his
visitor
could
only
wave
his
head
in
courteous
deprecation
under
which
there
seemed
a
suspicion
of
bewildered
embarrassment
he
was
a
spotlessly
clean
elderly
gentleman
with
white
whiskers
his
eyes
just
then
slightly
protuberant
were
shrewd
but
genial
he
had
a
wide
jolly
mouth
and
a
double
chin
he
was
dressed
like
a
man
who
is
above
disguising
his
prosperity
he
wore
a
large
pearl
in
his
crimson
scarf
and
had
probably
only
lately
discarded
his
summer
white
hat
and
white
waistcoat
my
dear
sir
he
began
in
a
rich
throaty
voice
as
soon
as
he
could
speak
my
dear
sir
you
must
think
this
is
a
most
unceremonious
way
of
ah
dropping
in
on
you
of
invading
your
privacy
not
at
all
said
horace
wondering
whether
he
could
possibly
intend
him
to
understand
that
he
had
come
in
by
the
window
i
afraid
there
was
no
one
to
show
you
in
my
clerk
is
away
just
now
no
matter
sir
no
matter
i
found
my
way
up
as
you
perceive
the
important
i
may
say
the
essential
fact
is
that
i
here
quite
so
said
horace
and
may
i
ask
what
brought
you
what
brought
the
stranger
eyes
grew
for
the
moment
allow
me
i
i
shall
come
to
that
in
good
time
i
am
still
a
little
as
you
can
see
he
glanced
round
the
room
you
are
i
think
an
architect
ah
mr
um
ventimore
is
my
name
said
horace
and
i
an
architect
ventimore
to
be
sure
he
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
produced
a
card
yes
it
all
quite
correct
i
see
i
have
the
name
here
and
an
architect
ventimore
so
i
i
am
given
to
understand
of
immense
ability
i
afraid
i
ca
claim
to
be
that
said
horace
but
i
may
call
myself
fairly
competent
competent
why
of
you
competent
do
you
suppose
sir
that
i
a
practical
business
man
should
come
to
any
one
who
was
competent
he
said
with
exactly
the
air
of
a
man
trying
to
convince
himself
against
his
own
judgment
that
he
was
acting
with
the
utmost
prudence
am
i
to
understand
that
some
one
has
been
good
enough
to
recommend
me
to
you
inquired
horace
certainly
not
sir
certainly
not
need
no
recommendation
but
my
own
judgment
i
ah
have
a
tolerable
acquaintance
with
all
that
is
going
on
in
the
art
world
and
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
eh
ah
ventimore
i
repeat
the
deliberate
and
unassisted
conclusion
that
you
are
the
one
man
living
who
can
do
what
i
want
delighted
to
hear
it
said
horace
genuinely
gratified
when
did
you
see
any
of
my
designs
never
mind
sir
i
do
decide
without
very
good
grounds
it
does
take
me
long
to
make
up
my
mind
and
when
my
mind
is
made
up
i
act
sir
i
act
and
to
come
to
the
point
i
have
a
small
commission
unworthy
i
am
quite
aware
of
your
ah
distinguished
talent
which
i
should
like
to
put
in
your
hands
is
going
to
ask
me
to
attend
a
sale
for
him
thought
horace
hanged
if
i
do
i
rather
busy
at
present
he
said
dubiously
as
you
may
see
not
sure
whether
i
put
the
matter
in
a
nutshell
sir
in
a
nutshell
my
name
is
wackerbath
samuel
wackerbath
tolerably
well
known
if
i
may
say
so
in
city
circles
horace
of
course
concealed
the
fact
that
his
name
and
fame
were
unfamiliar
to
him
i
lately
bought
a
few
acres
on
the
hampshire
border
near
the
house
i
living
in
just
now
and
been
thinking
as
i
was
saying
to
a
friend
only
just
now
as
we
were
crossing
westminster
bridge
i
been
thinking
of
building
myself
a
little
place
there
just
a
humble
unpretentious
home
where
i
could
run
down
for
the
weekend
and
entertain
a
friend
or
two
in
a
quiet
way
and
perhaps
live
some
part
of
the
year
hitherto
i
rented
places
as
i
wanted
old
family
seats
and
ancestral
mansions
and
so
forth
very
nice
in
their
way
but
i
want
to
feel
under
a
roof
of
my
own
i
want
to
surround
myself
with
the
simple
comforts
the
ah
unassuming
elegance
of
an
english
country
home
and
you
the
man
i
feel
more
convinced
of
it
with
every
word
you
say
you
the
man
to
do
the
job
in
style
ah
to
execute
the
work
as
it
should
be
done
here
was
the
client
at
last
and
it
was
satisfactory
to
feel
that
he
had
arrived
in
the
most
ordinary
and
commonplace
course
for
no
one
could
look
at
samuel
wackerbath
and
believe
for
a
moment
that
he
was
capable
of
floating
through
an
upper
window
he
was
not
in
the
least
that
kind
of
person
i
shall
be
happy
to
do
my
best
said
horace
with
a
calmness
that
surprised
himself
could
you
give
me
some
idea
of
the
amount
you
are
prepared
to
spend
well
i
no
croesus
though
i
wo
say
i
a
pauper
precisely
and
as
i
remarked
before
i
prefer
comfort
to
splendour
i
do
think
i
should
be
justified
in
going
beyond
well
say
sixty
thousand
sixty
thousand
exclaimed
horace
who
had
expected
about
a
tenth
of
that
sum
oh
not
than
sixty
thousand
i
see
i
mean
on
the
house
itself
explained
wackerbath
there
will
be
outbuildings
lodges
cottages
and
so
forth
and
then
some
of
the
rooms
i
should
want
specially
decorated
altogether
before
we
are
finished
it
may
work
out
at
about
a
hundred
thousand
i
take
it
that
with
such
a
margin
you
could
ah
run
me
up
something
that
in
a
modest
way
would
take
the
shine
out
of
i
mean
to
say
eclipse
anything
in
the
adjoining
counties
i
certainly
think
said
horace
that
for
such
a
sum
as
that
i
can
undertake
that
you
shall
have
a
home
which
will
satisfy
you
and
he
proceeded
to
put
the
usual
questions
as
to
site
soil
available
building
materials
the
accommodation
that
would
be
required
and
so
on
you
young
sir
said
wackerbath
at
the
end
of
the
interview
but
i
perceive
you
are
up
to
all
the
tricks
of
the
i
say
versed
in
the
of
your
profession
you
would
like
to
run
down
and
look
at
the
ground
eh
well
that
only
reasonable
and
my
wife
and
daughters
will
want
to
have
say
in
the
matter
no
getting
on
without
pleasing
the
ladies
hey
now
let
me
see
sunday
why
not
come
down
by
the
to
lipsfield
i
have
a
trap
or
a
brougham
and
pair
or
something
waiting
for
you
take
you
over
the
ground
myself
bring
you
back
to
lunch
with
us
at
oriel
court
and
talk
the
whole
thing
thoroughly
over
then
we
send
you
up
to
town
in
the
evening
and
you
can
start
work
the
first
thing
on
monday
that
suit
you
very
well
then
we
expect
you
with
this
wackerbath
departed
leaving
horace
as
may
be
imagined
absolutely
overwhelmed
by
the
suddenness
and
completeness
of
his
good
fortune
he
was
no
longer
one
of
the
unemployed
he
had
work
to
do
and
better
still
work
that
would
interest
him
give
him
all
the
scope
and
opportunity
he
could
wish
for
with
a
client
who
seemed
tractable
and
to
whom
money
was
clearly
no
object
he
might
carry
out
some
of
his
most
ambitious
ideas
moreover
he
would
now
be
in
a
position
to
speak
to
sylvia
father
without
fear
of
a
repulse
his
commission
on
would
be
and
that
on
the
decorations
and
other
work
at
least
as
much
again
probably
more
in
a
year
he
could
marry
without
imprudence
in
two
or
three
years
he
might
be
making
a
handsome
income
for
he
felt
confident
that
with
such
a
start
he
would
soon
have
as
much
work
as
he
could
undertake
he
was
ashamed
of
himself
for
ever
having
lost
heart
what
were
the
last
few
years
of
weary
waiting
but
probation
and
preparation
for
this
splendid
chance
which
had
come
just
when
he
really
needed
it
and
in
the
most
simple
and
natural
manner
he
loyally
completed
the
work
he
had
promised
to
do
for
beevor
who
would
have
to
dispense
with
his
assistance
in
future
and
then
he
felt
too
excited
and
restless
to
stay
in
the
office
and
after
lunching
at
his
club
as
usual
he
promised
himself
the
pleasure
of
going
to
cottesmore
gardens
and
telling
sylvia
his
good
news
it
was
still
early
and
he
walked
the
whole
way
as
some
vent
for
his
high
spirits
enjoying
everything
with
a
new
zest
the
dappled
grey
and
salmon
sky
before
him
the
amber
russet
and
yellow
of
the
scanty
foliage
in
kensington
gardens
the
pungent
scent
of
fallen
chestnuts
and
acorns
and
burning
leaves
the
mist
stealing
between
the
distant
and
then
the
cheery
bustle
and
brilliancy
of
the
high
street
finally
came
the
joy
of
finding
sylvia
all
alone
and
witnessing
her
frank
delight
at
what
he
had
come
to
tell
her
of
feeling
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
and
holding
her
in
his
arms
as
their
lips
met
for
the
first
time
if
on
that
saturday
afternoon
there
was
a
happier
man
than
horace
ventimore
he
would
have
done
well
to
dissemble
his
felicity
for
fear
of
incurring
the
jealousy
of
the
high
gods
when
futvoye
returned
as
she
did
only
too
soon
to
find
her
daughter
and
horace
seated
on
the
same
sofa
she
did
not
pretend
to
be
gratified
this
is
taking
a
most
unfair
advantage
of
what
i
was
weak
enough
to
say
last
night
ventimore
she
began
i
thought
i
could
have
trusted
you
i
should
have
come
so
soon
he
said
if
my
position
were
what
it
was
only
yesterday
but
it
changed
since
then
and
i
venture
to
hope
that
even
the
professor
wo
object
now
to
our
being
regularly
engaged
and
he
told
her
of
the
sudden
alteration
in
his
prospects
well
said
futvoye
you
had
better
speak
to
my
husband
about
it
the
professor
came
in
shortly
afterwards
and
horace
immediately
requested
a
few
minutes
conversation
with
him
in
the
study
which
was
readily
granted
the
study
to
which
the
professor
led
the
way
was
built
out
at
the
back
of
the
house
and
crowded
with
oriental
curios
of
every
age
and
kind
the
furniture
had
been
made
by
cairene
and
along
the
cornices
of
the
were
texts
from
the
koran
while
every
chair
bore
the
arabic
for
welcome
in
a
gilded
firework
on
its
leather
back
the
lamp
was
a
perforated
mosque
lantern
with
long
pendent
glass
tubes
like
hyacinth
glasses
a
smiled
from
a
corner
with
laboured
well
began
the
professor
as
soon
as
they
were
seated
so
i
was
not
mistaken
there
was
something
in
the
brass
bottle
after
all
then
have
a
look
at
it
whatever
it
is
for
the
moment
horace
had
almost
forgotten
the
bottle
oh
he
said
i
i
got
it
open
but
there
was
nothing
in
it
just
as
i
anticipated
sir
said
the
professor
i
told
you
there
could
be
anything
in
a
bottle
of
that
description
it
was
simply
throwing
money
away
to
buy
it
i
dare
say
it
was
but
i
wished
to
speak
to
you
on
a
much
more
important
matter
and
horace
briefly
explained
his
object
dear
me
said
the
professor
rubbing
up
his
hair
irritably
dear
me
i
no
idea
of
this
no
idea
at
all
i
was
under
the
impression
that
you
volunteered
to
act
as
escort
to
my
wife
and
daughter
at
luc
purely
out
of
good
nature
to
relieve
me
from
what
to
a
man
of
my
habits
in
that
extreme
heat
would
have
been
an
arduous
and
distasteful
duty
i
was
not
wholly
unselfish
i
admit
said
horace
i
fell
in
love
with
your
daughter
sir
the
first
day
i
met
her
only
i
felt
i
had
no
right
as
a
poor
man
with
no
prospects
to
speak
to
her
or
you
at
that
time
a
very
creditable
feeling
but
i
yet
to
learn
why
you
should
have
overcome
it
so
for
the
third
time
ventimore
told
the
story
of
the
sudden
turn
in
his
fortunes
i
know
this
samuel
wackerbath
by
name
said
the
professor
one
of
the
chief
partners
in
the
firm
of
akers
and
coverdale
the
great
estate
agents
a
most
influential
man
if
you
can
only
succeed
in
satisfying
him
oh
i
do
feel
any
misgivings
about
that
sir
said
horace
i
mean
to
build
him
a
house
that
will
be
beyond
his
wildest
expectations
and
you
see
that
in
a
year
i
shall
have
earned
several
thousands
and
i
need
not
say
that
i
will
make
any
settlement
you
think
proper
when
i
marry
when
you
are
in
possession
of
those
thousands
remarked
the
professor
dryly
it
will
be
time
enough
to
talk
of
marrying
and
making
settlements
meanwhile
if
you
and
sylvia
choose
to
consider
yourselves
engaged
i
wo
object
only
i
must
insist
on
having
your
promise
that
you
wo
persuade
her
to
marry
you
without
her
mother
and
my
consent
ventimore
gave
this
undertaking
willingly
enough
and
they
returned
to
the
futvoye
could
hardly
avoid
asking
horace
in
his
new
character
of
to
stay
and
dine
which
it
need
not
be
said
he
was
only
too
delighted
to
do
there
is
one
thing
my
dear
er
horace
said
the
professor
solemnly
after
dinner
when
the
neat
parlourmaid
had
left
them
at
dessert
one
thing
on
which
i
think
it
my
duty
to
caution
you
if
you
are
to
justify
the
confidence
we
have
shown
in
sanctioning
your
engagement
to
sylvia
you
must
curb
this
propensity
of
yours
to
needless
extravagance
papa
cried
sylvia
what
have
made
you
think
horace
extravagant
really
said
horace
i
should
have
called
myself
particularly
so
nobody
ever
call
himself
particularly
extravagant
retorted
the
professor
but
i
observed
at
luc
that
you
habitually
gave
fifty
centimes
as
a
when
twopence
or
even
a
penny
would
have
been
handsome
and
no
one
with
any
regard
for
the
value
of
money
would
have
given
a
guinea
for
a
worthless
brass
vessel
on
the
bare
chance
that
it
might
contain
manuscripts
which
as
any
one
could
have
foreseen
it
did
not
but
it
not
a
bad
sort
of
bottle
sir
pleaded
horace
if
you
remember
you
said
yourself
the
shape
was
unusual
why
should
it
be
worth
all
the
money
and
more
to
a
collector
perhaps
said
the
professor
with
his
wonted
amiability
which
you
are
not
no
i
can
only
call
it
a
senseless
and
reprehensible
waste
of
money
well
the
truth
is
said
horace
i
bought
it
with
some
idea
that
it
might
interest
then
you
were
mistaken
sir
it
does
interest
me
why
should
i
be
interested
in
a
metal
jar
which
for
anything
that
appears
to
the
contrary
may
have
been
cast
the
other
day
at
birmingham
but
there
something
said
horace
a
seal
or
inscription
of
some
sort
engraved
on
the
cap
did
i
mention
it
you
said
nothing
about
an
inscription
before
replied
the
professor
with
rather
more
interest
what
is
the
character
arabic
persian
kufic
i
really
could
say
it
almost
rubbed
out
queer
little
triangular
marks
something
like
birds
footprints
that
sounds
like
cuneiform
said
the
professor
which
would
seem
to
point
to
a
phoenician
origin
and
as
i
am
acquainted
with
no
oriental
brass
earlier
than
the
ninth
century
of
our
era
i
should
regard
your
description
as
distinctly
unlikely
however
i
should
certainly
like
to
have
an
opportunity
of
examining
the
bottle
for
myself
some
day
whenever
you
please
professor
when
can
you
come
why
i
so
much
occupied
all
day
that
i
ca
say
for
certain
when
i
can
get
up
to
your
office
again
my
own
days
will
be
fairly
full
now
said
horace
and
the
thing
not
at
the
office
but
in
my
rooms
at
vincent
square
why
should
you
all
come
and
dine
quietly
there
some
evening
next
week
and
then
you
could
examine
the
inscription
comfortably
afterwards
you
know
professor
and
find
out
what
it
really
is
do
say
you
will
he
was
eager
to
have
the
privilege
of
entertaining
sylvia
in
his
own
rooms
for
the
first
time
no
no
said
the
professor
i
see
no
reason
why
you
should
be
troubled
with
the
entire
family
i
may
drop
in
alone
some
evening
and
take
the
luck
of
the
pot
sir
thank
you
papa
put
in
sylvia
but
should
like
to
come
too
please
and
hear
what
you
think
of
horace
bottle
and
i
dying
to
see
his
rooms
i
believe
they
fearfully
luxurious
i
trust
observed
her
father
that
they
are
far
indeed
from
answering
that
description
if
they
did
i
should
consider
it
a
most
unsatisfactory
indication
of
horace
character
there
nothing
magnificent
about
them
i
assure
you
said
horace
though
it
true
i
had
them
done
up
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
at
my
own
expense
but
quite
simply
i
could
afford
to
spend
much
on
them
but
do
come
and
see
them
i
must
have
a
little
dinner
to
celebrate
my
good
fortune
it
will
be
so
jolly
if
you
all
three
come
if
we
do
come
stipulated
the
professor
it
must
be
on
the
distinct
understanding
that
you
do
provide
an
elaborate
banquet
plain
simple
wholesome
food
well
cooked
such
as
we
have
had
this
evening
is
all
that
is
necessary
more
would
be
ostentatious
my
dad
protested
sylvia
in
distress
at
this
somewhat
dictatorial
speech
surely
you
can
leave
all
that
to
horace
horace
my
dear
understands
that
in
speaking
as
i
did
i
was
simply
treating
him
as
a
potential
member
of
my
family
here
sylvia
made
a
private
little
grimace
no
young
man
who
contemplates
marrying
should
allow
himself
to
launch
into
extravagance
on
the
strength
of
prospects
which
for
all
he
can
tell
said
the
professor
genially
may
prove
fallacious
on
the
contrary
if
his
affection
is
sincere
he
will
incur
as
little
expense
as
possible
put
by
every
penny
he
can
save
rather
than
subject
the
girl
he
professes
to
love
to
the
ordeal
of
a
long
engagement
in
other
words
the
truest
lover
is
the
best
economist
i
quite
understand
sir
said
horace
it
would
be
foolish
of
me
to
attempt
any
ambitious
form
of
entertainment
especially
as
my
landlady
though
an
excellent
plain
cook
is
not
exactly
a
so
you
can
come
to
my
modest
board
without
misgivings
before
he
left
a
provisional
date
for
the
dinner
was
fixed
for
an
evening
towards
the
end
of
the
next
week
and
horace
walked
home
treading
on
air
rather
than
hard
and
striking
the
stars
with
his
uplifted
head
the
next
day
he
went
down
to
lipsfield
and
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
whole
wackerbath
family
who
were
all
enthusiastic
about
the
proposed
country
house
the
site
was
everything
that
the
most
exacting
architect
could
desire
and
he
came
back
to
town
the
same
evening
having
spent
a
pleasant
day
and
learnt
enough
of
his
client
requirements
and
what
was
even
more
important
those
of
his
client
wife
and
daughters
to
enable
him
to
begin
work
upon
the
the
next
morning
he
had
not
been
long
in
his
rooms
at
vincent
square
and
was
still
agreeably
engaged
in
recalling
the
docility
and
ready
appreciation
with
which
the
wackerbaths
had
received
his
suggestions
and
rough
sketches
their
compliments
and
absolute
confidence
in
his
skill
when
he
had
a
shock
which
was
as
disagreeable
as
it
was
certainly
unexpected
for
the
wall
before
him
parted
like
a
film
and
through
it
stepped
smiling
benignantly
the
figure
of
the
jinnee
chapter
vi
embarras
de
richesses
ventimore
had
so
thoroughly
convinced
himself
that
the
released
jinnee
was
purely
a
creature
of
his
own
imagination
that
he
rubbed
his
eyes
with
a
start
hoping
that
they
had
deceived
him
stroke
thy
head
o
merciful
and
meritorious
one
said
his
visitor
and
recover
thy
faculties
to
receive
good
tidings
for
it
is
indeed
i
whom
thou
beholdest
i
i
delighted
to
see
you
said
horace
as
cordially
as
he
could
is
there
anything
i
can
do
for
you
nay
for
hast
thou
not
done
me
the
greatest
of
all
services
by
setting
me
free
to
escape
out
of
a
bottle
is
pleasant
and
to
thee
i
owe
my
deliverance
it
was
all
true
then
he
had
really
let
an
imprisoned
genius
or
jinnee
or
whatever
it
was
out
of
that
bottle
he
knew
he
could
not
be
dreaming
now
he
only
wished
he
were
however
since
it
was
done
his
best
course
seemed
to
be
to
put
a
good
face
on
it
and
persuade
this
uncanny
being
somehow
to
go
away
and
leave
him
in
peace
for
the
future
oh
that
all
right
my
dear
sir
he
said
do
think
any
more
about
it
i
i
rather
understood
you
to
say
that
you
were
starting
on
a
journey
in
search
of
solomon
i
have
been
and
returned
for
i
visited
sundry
cities
in
his
dominions
hoping
that
by
chance
i
might
hear
news
of
him
but
i
refrained
from
asking
directly
lest
thereby
i
should
engender
suspicion
and
so
suleyman
should
learn
of
my
escape
before
i
could
obtain
an
audience
of
him
and
implore
justice
oh
i
should
think
that
was
likely
said
horace
if
i
were
you
i
should
go
straight
back
and
go
on
travelling
till
i
find
suleyman
well
was
it
said
not
any
door
without
knocking
lest
haply
that
which
thou
seekest
should
be
behind
it
exactly
said
horace
do
each
city
thoroughly
house
by
house
and
do
neglect
the
smallest
clue
at
first
you
do
succeed
try
try
try
again
as
one
of
our
own
poets
teaches
try
try
again
echoed
the
jinnee
with
an
admiration
that
was
almost
fatuous
divinely
gifted
truly
was
he
who
composed
such
a
verse
he
has
a
great
reputation
as
a
sage
said
horace
and
the
maxim
is
considered
one
of
his
happiest
efforts
do
you
think
that
as
the
east
is
rather
thickly
populated
the
less
time
you
lose
in
following
the
poet
recommendation
the
better
it
may
be
as
thou
sayest
but
know
this
o
my
son
that
wheresoever
i
may
wander
i
shall
never
cease
to
study
how
i
may
most
fitly
reward
thee
for
thy
kindness
towards
me
for
nobly
it
was
said
i
be
possessed
of
wealth
and
be
not
liberal
may
my
head
never
be
extended
my
good
sir
said
horace
do
please
understand
that
if
you
were
to
offer
me
any
reward
for
for
a
very
ordinary
act
of
courtesy
i
should
be
obliged
to
decline
it
but
didst
thou
not
say
that
thou
wast
sorely
in
need
of
a
client
that
was
so
at
the
time
said
horace
but
since
i
last
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
i
have
met
with
one
who
is
all
i
could
possibly
wish
for
i
am
indeed
rejoiced
to
hear
it
returned
the
jinnee
for
thou
showest
me
that
i
have
succeeded
in
performing
the
first
service
which
thou
hast
demanded
of
me
horace
staggered
under
this
severe
blow
to
his
pride
for
the
moment
he
could
only
gasp
you
sent
him
to
me
i
and
no
other
said
the
jinnee
beaming
with
satisfaction
for
while
unseen
of
men
i
was
circling
in
air
resolved
to
attend
to
thy
affair
before
beginning
my
search
for
suleyman
on
whom
be
peace
it
chanced
that
i
overheard
a
human
being
of
prosperous
appearance
say
aloud
upon
a
bridge
that
he
desired
to
erect
for
himself
a
palace
if
he
could
but
find
an
architect
so
perceiving
thee
afar
off
seated
at
an
open
casement
i
immediately
transported
him
to
the
place
and
delivered
him
into
thy
hands
but
he
knew
my
name
he
had
my
card
in
his
pocket
said
horace
i
furnished
him
with
the
paper
containing
thy
names
and
abode
lest
he
should
be
ignorant
of
them
well
look
here
fakrash
said
the
unfortunate
horace
i
know
you
meant
well
but
do
a
thing
like
that
again
if
my
came
to
know
of
it
i
should
be
accused
of
most
unprofessional
behaviour
i
no
idea
you
would
take
that
way
of
introducing
a
client
to
me
or
i
should
have
stopped
it
at
once
it
was
an
error
said
fakrash
no
matter
i
will
undo
this
affair
and
devise
some
other
and
better
means
of
serving
thee
no
no
he
said
for
heaven
sake
leave
things
alone
you
only
make
them
worse
forgive
me
my
dear
fakrash
i
afraid
i
must
seem
most
ungrateful
but
but
i
was
so
taken
by
surprise
and
really
i
am
extremely
obliged
to
you
for
though
the
means
you
took
were
were
a
little
irregular
you
have
done
me
a
very
great
service
it
is
naught
said
the
jinnee
compared
to
those
i
hope
to
render
so
great
a
benefactor
but
indeed
you
must
think
of
trying
to
do
any
more
for
me
urged
horace
who
felt
the
absolute
necessity
of
expelling
any
scheme
of
further
benevolence
from
the
jinnee
head
once
and
for
all
you
have
done
enough
why
thanks
to
you
i
am
engaged
to
build
a
palace
that
will
keep
me
hard
at
work
and
happy
for
ever
so
long
are
human
beings
then
so
enamoured
of
hard
labour
asked
fakrash
in
wonder
it
is
not
thus
with
the
jinn
i
love
my
work
for
its
own
sake
said
horace
and
then
when
i
have
finished
it
i
shall
have
earned
a
very
fair
amount
of
money
which
is
particularly
important
to
me
just
now
and
why
my
son
art
thou
so
desirous
of
obtaining
riches
because
said
horace
unless
a
man
is
tolerably
well
off
in
these
days
he
can
not
hope
to
marry
fakrash
smiled
with
indulgent
compassion
how
excellent
is
the
saying
of
one
of
old
that
adventureth
upon
matrimony
is
like
unto
one
who
thrusteth
his
hand
into
a
sack
containing
many
thousands
of
serpents
and
one
eel
yet
if
fate
so
decree
he
draw
forth
the
eel
and
thou
art
comely
and
of
an
age
when
it
is
natural
to
desire
the
love
of
a
maiden
therefore
be
of
good
heart
and
a
cheerful
eye
and
it
may
be
that
when
i
am
more
at
leisure
i
shall
find
thee
a
helpmate
who
shall
rejoice
thy
soul
please
do
trouble
to
find
me
anything
of
the
sort
said
horace
hastily
with
a
mental
vision
of
some
helpless
and
scandalised
stranger
being
shot
into
his
dwelling
like
coals
i
assure
you
i
would
much
rather
win
a
wife
for
myself
in
the
ordinary
way
as
thanks
to
your
kindness
i
have
every
hope
of
doing
before
long
is
there
already
some
damsel
for
whom
thy
heart
pineth
if
so
fear
not
to
tell
me
her
names
and
dwelling
place
and
i
will
assuredly
obtain
her
for
thee
but
ventimore
had
seen
enough
of
the
jinnee
oriental
methods
to
doubt
his
tact
and
discretion
where
sylvia
was
concerned
no
no
of
course
not
i
spoke
generally
he
said
it
exceedingly
kind
of
you
but
i
wish
i
could
make
you
understand
that
i
am
overpaid
as
it
is
you
have
put
me
in
the
way
to
make
a
name
and
fortune
for
myself
if
i
fail
it
will
be
my
own
fault
and
at
all
events
i
want
nothing
more
from
you
if
you
mean
to
find
suleyman
on
whom
be
peace
you
must
go
and
live
in
the
east
altogether
for
he
certainly
is
over
here
you
must
give
up
your
whole
time
to
it
keep
as
quiet
as
possible
and
do
be
discouraged
by
any
reports
you
may
hear
above
all
never
trouble
your
head
about
me
or
my
affairs
again
o
thou
of
wisdom
and
eloquence
said
fakrash
this
is
most
excellent
advice
i
will
go
then
but
may
i
drink
the
cup
of
perdition
if
i
become
unmindful
of
thy
benevolence
and
raising
his
joined
hands
above
his
head
as
he
spoke
he
sank
feet
foremost
through
the
carpet
and
was
gone
thank
heaven
thought
ventimore
he
taken
the
hint
at
last
i
think
i
likely
to
see
any
more
of
him
i
feel
an
ungrateful
brute
for
saying
so
but
i
ca
help
it
i
can
stand
being
under
any
obligation
to
a
jinnee
who
been
shut
up
in
a
beastly
brass
bottle
ever
since
the
days
of
solomon
who
probably
had
very
good
reasons
for
putting
him
there
horace
next
asked
himself
whether
he
was
bound
in
honour
to
disclose
the
facts
to
wackerbath
and
give
him
the
opportunity
of
withdrawing
from
the
agreement
if
he
thought
fit
on
the
whole
he
saw
no
necessity
for
telling
him
anything
the
only
possible
result
would
be
to
make
his
client
suspect
his
sanity
and
who
would
care
to
employ
an
insane
architect
then
if
he
retired
from
the
undertaking
without
any
explanations
what
could
he
say
to
sylvia
what
would
sylvia
father
say
to
there
would
certainly
be
an
end
to
his
engagement
after
all
he
had
not
been
to
blame
the
wackerbaths
were
quite
satisfied
he
felt
perfectly
sure
that
he
could
justify
their
selection
of
him
he
would
wrong
nobody
by
accepting
the
commission
while
he
would
only
offend
them
injure
himself
irretrievably
and
lose
all
hope
of
gaining
sylvia
if
he
made
any
attempt
to
undeceive
them
and
fakrash
was
gone
never
to
return
so
on
all
these
considerations
horace
decided
that
silence
was
his
only
possible
policy
and
though
some
moralists
may
condemn
his
conduct
as
disingenuous
and
wanting
in
true
moral
courage
i
venture
to
doubt
whether
any
reader
however
independent
straightforward
and
indifferent
to
notoriety
and
ridicule
would
have
behaved
otherwise
in
ventimore
extremely
delicate
and
difficult
position
some
days
passed
every
working
hour
of
which
was
spent
by
horace
in
the
rapture
of
creation
to
every
man
with
the
soul
of
an
artist
in
him
there
comes
at
times
only
too
seldom
in
most
cases
a
revelation
of
latent
power
that
he
had
not
dared
to
hope
for
and
now
with
ventimore
years
of
study
and
theorising
which
he
had
often
been
tempted
to
think
wasted
began
to
bear
golden
fruit
he
designed
and
drew
with
a
rapidity
and
originality
a
sense
of
perfect
mastery
of
the
various
problems
to
be
dealt
with
and
a
delight
in
the
working
out
of
mass
and
detail
so
intoxicating
that
he
almost
dreaded
lest
he
should
be
the
victim
of
some
his
evenings
were
of
course
spent
with
the
futvoyes
in
discovering
sylvia
in
some
new
and
yet
more
adorable
aspect
altogether
he
was
very
much
in
love
very
happy
and
very
busy
three
states
not
invariably
found
in
combination
and
as
he
had
foreseen
he
had
effectually
got
rid
of
fakrash
who
was
evidently
too
engrossed
in
the
pursuit
of
solomon
to
think
of
anything
else
and
there
seemed
no
reason
why
he
should
abandon
his
search
for
a
generation
or
two
for
it
would
probably
take
all
that
time
to
convince
him
that
that
mighty
monarch
was
no
longer
on
the
throne
it
would
have
been
too
brutal
to
tell
him
myself
thought
horace
when
he
was
so
keen
on
having
his
case
reheard
and
it
gives
him
an
object
poor
old
buffer
and
keeps
him
from
interfering
in
my
affairs
so
it
best
for
both
of
us
horace
little
had
been
twice
postponed
till
he
had
begun
to
have
a
superstitious
fear
that
it
would
never
come
off
but
at
length
the
professor
had
been
induced
to
give
an
absolute
promise
for
a
certain
evening
on
the
day
before
after
breakfast
horace
had
summoned
his
landlady
to
a
consultation
on
the
nothing
elaborate
you
know
rapkin
said
horace
who
though
he
would
have
liked
to
provide
a
feast
of
all
procurable
delicacies
for
sylvia
refection
was
obliged
to
respect
her
father
prejudices
just
a
simple
dinner
thoroughly
well
cooked
and
nicely
served
as
you
know
so
well
how
to
do
it
i
suppose
sir
you
would
require
rapkin
to
wait
as
the
was
liable
to
trances
on
these
occasions
during
which
he
could
do
nothing
but
smile
and
bow
with
speechless
politeness
as
he
dropped
and
plates
horace
replied
that
he
thought
of
having
someone
in
to
avoid
troubling
rapkin
but
his
wife
expressed
such
confidence
in
her
husband
proving
equal
to
all
emergencies
that
ventimore
waived
the
point
and
left
it
to
her
to
hire
extra
help
if
she
thought
fit
now
what
soup
can
you
give
us
he
inquired
as
rapkin
stood
at
attention
and
quite
unmollified
after
protracted
mental
conflict
she
grudgingly
suggested
gravy
soup
which
horace
thought
too
unenterprising
and
rejected
in
favour
of
mock
turtle
well
then
fish
he
continued
how
about
fish
rapkin
dragged
the
depths
of
her
culinary
resources
for
several
seconds
and
finally
brought
to
the
surface
what
she
called
a
nice
fried
sole
horace
would
not
hear
of
it
and
urged
her
to
aspire
to
salmon
she
substituted
smelts
which
he
opposed
by
a
happy
inspiration
of
turbot
and
lobster
sauce
the
sauce
however
presented
insuperable
difficulties
to
her
mind
and
she
offered
a
compromise
in
the
form
of
cod
which
he
finally
accepted
as
a
fish
which
the
professor
could
hardly
censure
for
ostentation
next
came
the
no
less
difficult
questions
of
or
no
of
joint
and
bird
what
in
season
just
now
said
horace
let
me
see
and
glanced
out
of
the
window
as
he
spoke
as
though
in
search
of
some
outside
suggestion
camels
by
jove
he
suddenly
exclaimed
ventimore
sir
repeated
rapkin
in
some
bewilderment
and
then
remembering
that
he
was
given
to
untimely
flippancy
she
gave
a
tolerant
little
cough
i
be
shot
if
they
camels
said
horace
what
do
make
of
mrs
rapkin
out
of
the
faint
mist
which
hung
over
the
farther
end
of
the
square
advanced
a
procession
of
tall
animals
with
long
delicately
poised
necks
and
a
mincing
gait
even
rapkin
could
not
succeed
in
making
anything
of
them
except
camels
what
the
deuce
does
a
caravan
of
camels
want
in
vincent
square
said
horace
with
a
sudden
qualm
for
which
he
could
not
account
most
likely
they
belong
to
the
barnum
show
sir
suggested
his
landlady
i
did
hear
they
were
coming
to
olympia
again
this
year
why
of
course
cried
horace
intensely
relieved
it
on
their
way
from
the
docks
at
least
it
is
of
their
way
or
probably
the
main
road
up
for
repairs
that
it
they
turn
off
to
the
left
at
the
corner
see
they
got
arab
drivers
with
them
wonderful
how
the
fellows
manage
them
it
seems
to
me
sir
said
rapkin
that
they
coming
way
they
seem
to
be
stopping
outside
do
talk
such
infernal
i
beg
your
pardon
rapkin
but
why
on
earth
should
barnum
and
bailey
camels
come
out
of
their
way
to
call
on
it
ridiculous
you
know
said
horace
irritably
ridicklous
it
be
sir
she
retorted
but
they
all
down
on
the
road
opposite
our
door
as
you
can
see
and
them
niggers
is
making
signs
to
you
to
come
out
and
speak
to
it
was
true
enough
one
by
one
the
camels
which
were
apparently
of
the
purest
breed
folded
themselves
up
in
a
row
like
campstools
at
a
sign
from
their
attendants
who
were
now
making
profound
salaams
towards
the
window
where
ventimore
was
standing
i
suppose
i
better
go
down
and
see
what
they
want
he
said
with
rather
a
sickly
smile
they
may
have
lost
the
way
to
olympia
i
only
hope
fakrash
is
at
the
bottom
of
this
he
thought
as
he
went
downstairs
but
he
come
himself
at
all
events
he
would
send
me
a
message
on
such
a
lot
of
camels
as
he
appeared
on
the
doorstep
all
the
drivers
flopped
down
and
rubbed
their
flat
black
noses
on
the
curbstone
for
heaven
sake
get
up
said
horace
angrily
this
hammersmith
turn
to
the
left
into
the
vauxhall
bridge
road
and
ask
a
policeman
the
nearest
way
to
olympia
be
not
angry
with
thy
slaves
said
the
head
driver
in
excellent
english
we
are
here
by
command
of
our
lord
whom
we
are
bound
to
obey
and
we
have
brought
thee
these
as
gifts
my
compliments
to
your
master
said
horace
between
his
teeth
and
tell
him
that
a
london
architect
has
no
sort
of
occasion
for
camels
say
that
i
am
extremely
obliged
but
am
compelled
to
decline
them
o
highly
born
one
explained
the
driver
the
camels
are
not
a
gift
but
the
loads
which
are
upon
the
camels
suffer
us
therefore
since
we
dare
not
disobey
our
lord
commands
to
carry
these
trifling
tokens
of
his
good
will
into
thy
dwelling
and
depart
in
peace
horace
had
not
noticed
till
then
that
every
camel
bore
a
heavy
burden
which
the
attendants
were
now
unloading
oh
if
you
he
said
not
too
graciously
only
do
look
sharp
about
it
there
a
crowd
collecting
already
and
i
do
want
to
have
a
constable
here
he
returned
to
his
rooms
where
he
found
rapkin
paralysed
with
amazement
it
it
all
right
he
said
i
forgotten
it
only
a
few
oriental
things
from
the
place
where
that
brass
bottle
came
from
you
know
they
left
them
here
on
approval
seems
funny
their
sending
their
goods
on
camels
sir
does
it
said
rapkin
not
at
all
funny
said
horace
they
they
an
enterprising
firm
their
way
of
advertising
one
after
another
a
train
of
dusky
attendants
entered
each
of
whom
deposited
his
load
on
the
floor
with
a
guttural
grunt
and
returned
backward
until
the
was
blocked
with
piles
of
sacks
and
bales
and
chests
whereupon
the
head
driver
appeared
and
intimated
that
the
tale
of
gifts
was
complete
i
wonder
what
sort
of
tip
this
fellow
expects
thought
horace
a
sovereign
seems
shabby
but
it
all
i
can
run
to
i
try
him
with
that
but
the
overseer
repudiated
all
idea
of
a
gratuity
with
stately
dignity
and
as
horace
saw
him
to
the
gate
he
found
a
stolid
constable
by
the
railings
this
wo
you
know
said
the
constable
these
camels
must
move
on
or
i
shall
to
interfere
it
all
right
constable
said
horace
pressing
into
his
hand
the
sovereign
the
head
driver
had
rejected
they
going
to
move
on
now
they
brought
me
a
few
presents
from
from
a
friend
of
mine
in
the
east
by
this
time
the
attendants
had
mounted
the
kneeling
camels
which
rose
with
them
and
swung
off
round
the
square
in
a
long
swaying
trot
that
soon
left
the
crowd
far
behind
staring
blankly
after
the
caravan
as
camel
after
camel
disappeared
into
the
haze
i
should
mind
knowin
that
friend
o
yours
sir
said
the
constable
sort
o
gentleman
i
should
think
very
said
horace
savagely
and
returned
to
his
room
which
rapkin
had
now
left
his
hands
shook
though
not
with
joy
as
he
untied
some
of
the
sacks
and
bales
and
forced
open
the
chests
the
contents
of
which
almost
took
away
his
breath
for
in
the
bales
were
carpets
and
tissues
which
he
saw
at
a
glance
must
be
of
fabulous
antiquity
and
beyond
all
price
the
sacks
held
golden
ewers
and
vessels
of
strange
workmanship
and
pantomimic
proportions
the
chests
were
full
of
jewels
ropes
of
pearls
as
large
as
average
onions
strings
of
uncut
rubies
and
emeralds
the
smallest
of
which
would
have
been
a
tight
fit
in
an
ordinary
and
diamonds
roughly
facetted
and
polished
each
the
size
of
a
coconut
in
whose
hearts
quivered
a
liquid
and
prismatic
radiance
on
the
most
moderate
computation
the
total
value
of
these
gifts
could
hardly
be
less
than
several
hundred
millions
never
probably
in
the
world
history
had
any
treasury
contained
so
rich
a
store
it
would
have
been
difficult
for
anybody
on
suddenly
finding
himself
the
possessor
of
this
immense
incalculable
wealth
to
make
any
comment
quite
worthy
of
the
situation
but
surely
none
could
have
been
more
inadequate
and
indeed
inappropriate
than
horace
which
heartfelt
as
it
was
was
couched
in
the
simple
monosyllable
damn
chapter
vii
gratitude
a
lively
sense
of
favours
to
come
most
men
on
suddenly
finding
themselves
in
possession
of
such
enormous
wealth
would
have
felt
some
elation
ventimore
as
we
have
seen
was
merely
exasperated
and
although
this
attitude
of
his
may
strike
the
reader
as
incomprehensible
or
absolutely
he
had
more
reason
on
his
side
than
might
appear
at
a
first
view
it
was
undoubtedly
the
fact
that
with
the
money
these
treasures
represented
he
would
be
in
a
position
to
convulse
the
money
markets
of
europe
and
america
bring
society
to
his
feet
make
and
unmake
kingdoms
dominate
in
short
the
entire
world
but
then
as
horace
told
himself
with
a
groan
it
would
amuse
me
in
the
least
to
convulse
money
markets
do
i
want
to
see
the
smartest
people
in
london
grovelling
for
anything
they
think
they
likely
to
get
out
of
me
as
i
should
be
perfectly
well
aware
that
their
homage
was
not
paid
to
any
personal
merit
of
mine
i
could
hardly
consider
it
flattering
and
why
should
i
make
kingdoms
the
only
thing
i
understand
and
care
about
is
making
houses
then
am
i
likely
to
be
a
better
hand
at
dominating
the
world
than
all
the
others
who
have
tried
the
experiment
i
doubt
it
he
called
to
mind
all
the
millionaires
he
had
ever
read
or
heard
of
they
did
seem
to
get
much
fun
out
of
their
riches
the
majority
of
them
were
martyrs
to
dyspepsia
they
were
often
weighed
down
by
the
cares
and
responsibilities
of
their
position
the
only
people
who
were
unable
to
obtain
an
audience
of
them
at
any
time
were
their
friends
they
lived
in
a
glare
of
publicity
and
every
post
brought
them
hundreds
of
begging
letters
and
a
few
threats
their
children
were
in
constant
danger
from
kidnappers
and
they
themselves
after
knowing
no
rest
in
life
could
not
be
certain
that
even
their
tombs
would
be
undisturbed
whether
they
were
extravagant
or
thrifty
they
were
equally
maligned
and
whatever
the
fortune
they
left
behind
them
they
could
be
absolutely
certain
that
in
a
couple
of
generations
it
would
be
entirely
dissipated
and
the
biggest
millionaire
living
concluded
horace
is
a
pauper
compared
with
me
but
there
was
another
consideration
how
was
he
to
realise
all
this
wealth
he
knew
enough
about
precious
stones
to
be
aware
that
a
ruby
for
instance
of
the
true
pigeon
blood
colour
and
the
size
of
a
melon
as
most
of
these
rubies
were
would
be
worth
even
when
cut
considerably
over
a
million
but
who
would
buy
it
i
think
i
see
myself
he
reflected
grimly
calling
on
some
diamond
merchant
in
hatton
garden
with
half
a
dozen
assorted
jewels
in
a
gladstone
bag
if
he
believed
they
were
genuine
he
probably
have
a
fit
but
most
likely
he
think
i
invented
some
dodge
for
manufacturing
them
and
had
been
fool
enough
to
overdo
the
size
anyhow
he
want
to
know
how
they
came
into
my
possession
and
what
could
i
say
that
they
were
part
of
a
little
present
made
to
me
by
a
jinnee
in
grateful
acknowledgment
of
my
having
relieved
him
from
a
brass
bottle
in
which
he
been
shut
up
for
nearly
three
thousand
years
look
at
it
how
you
will
it
convincing
i
fancy
i
can
guess
what
he
say
and
what
an
ass
i
should
look
then
suppose
the
thing
got
into
the
papers
got
into
the
papers
why
of
course
it
would
get
into
the
papers
as
if
it
were
possible
in
these
days
for
a
young
and
hitherto
unemployed
architect
suddenly
to
surround
himself
with
wondrous
carpets
and
gold
vessels
and
gigantic
jewels
without
attracting
the
notice
of
some
enterprising
journalist
he
would
be
interviewed
the
story
of
his
curiously
acquired
riches
would
go
the
round
of
the
papers
he
would
find
himself
the
object
of
incredulity
suspicion
ridicule
in
imagination
he
could
already
see
the
headlines
on
the
bottled
billions
amazing
arabesques
by
an
architect
he
says
the
jar
contained
a
jinnee
sensational
story
diverting
details
and
so
on
through
every
phrase
of
alliterative
ingenuity
he
ground
his
teeth
at
the
mere
thought
of
it
then
sylvia
would
come
to
hear
of
it
and
what
would
think
she
would
naturally
be
repelled
as
any
girl
would
be
by
the
idea
that
her
lover
was
in
secret
alliance
with
a
supernatural
being
and
her
father
and
mother
would
they
allow
her
to
marry
a
man
however
rich
whose
wealth
came
from
such
a
questionable
source
no
one
would
believe
that
he
had
not
made
some
unholy
bargain
before
consenting
to
set
this
incarcerated
spirit
free
he
who
had
acted
in
absolute
ignorance
who
had
persistently
declined
all
reward
after
realising
what
he
had
done
no
it
was
too
much
try
as
he
might
to
do
justice
to
the
gratitude
and
generosity
he
could
not
restrain
a
bitter
resentment
at
the
utter
want
of
consideration
shown
in
overloading
him
with
gifts
so
useless
and
so
compromising
no
jinnee
however
old
however
unfamiliar
with
the
world
as
it
is
now
had
any
right
to
be
such
a
fool
and
at
this
above
the
ramparts
of
sacks
and
bales
which
occupied
all
the
available
space
in
the
room
appeared
rapkin
face
i
was
going
to
ask
you
sir
before
them
parcels
came
she
began
with
a
dry
cough
of
disapproval
what
you
would
like
in
the
way
of
ongtray
night
i
thought
if
i
could
find
a
sweetbread
at
all
reasonable
to
horace
surrounded
as
he
was
by
incalculable
riches
sweetbreads
seemed
incongruous
just
then
the
transition
of
thought
was
too
violent
i
ca
bother
about
that
now
rapkin
he
said
we
settle
it
i
too
busy
i
suppose
most
of
these
things
will
have
to
go
back
sir
if
only
sent
on
approval
like
if
he
only
knew
where
and
how
he
could
send
them
back
i
i
not
sure
he
said
i
may
have
to
keep
them
well
sir
bargain
or
none
i
would
have
as
a
gift
myself
being
so
dirty
and
fusty
they
ca
be
no
use
to
anybody
not
to
mention
there
being
no
room
to
move
with
them
blocking
up
all
the
place
better
tell
rapkin
to
carry
all
upstairs
out
of
people
way
certainly
not
said
horace
sharply
by
no
means
anxious
for
the
rapkins
to
discover
the
real
nature
of
his
treasures
do
touch
them
either
of
you
leave
them
exactly
as
they
are
do
you
understand
as
you
please
ventimore
sir
only
if
they
not
to
be
interfered
with
i
do
see
myself
how
you
going
to
set
your
friends
down
to
dinner
that
all
and
indeed
considering
that
the
table
and
every
available
chair
and
even
the
floor
were
heaped
so
high
with
valuables
that
horace
himself
could
only
just
squeeze
his
way
between
the
piles
it
seemed
as
if
his
guests
might
find
themselves
inconveniently
cramped
it
will
be
all
right
he
said
with
an
optimism
he
was
very
far
from
feeling
we
manage
somehow
leave
it
to
me
before
he
left
for
his
office
he
took
the
precaution
to
baffle
any
inquisitiveness
on
the
part
of
his
landlady
by
locking
his
door
and
carrying
away
the
key
but
it
was
in
a
very
different
mood
from
his
former
confidence
that
he
sat
down
to
his
in
great
cloister
street
that
morning
he
could
not
concentrate
his
mind
his
enthusiasm
and
his
ideas
had
alike
deserted
him
he
flung
down
the
dividers
he
had
been
using
and
pushed
away
the
nest
of
saucers
of
indian
ink
and
colours
in
a
fit
of
petulance
it
no
good
he
exclaimed
aloud
i
feel
a
perfect
duffer
this
morning
i
even
design
a
decent
even
as
he
spoke
he
became
conscious
of
a
presence
in
the
room
and
looking
round
saw
fakrash
the
jinnee
standing
at
his
elbow
smiling
down
on
him
more
benevolently
than
ever
and
with
a
serene
expectation
of
being
warmly
welcomed
and
thanked
which
made
horace
rather
ashamed
of
his
own
inability
to
meet
it
he
a
thoroughly
old
chap
he
thought
he
means
well
and
i
a
beast
not
to
feel
more
glad
to
see
him
and
yet
hang
it
all
i
ca
have
him
popping
in
and
out
of
the
office
like
a
rabbit
whenever
the
fancy
takes
him
peace
be
upon
thee
said
fakrash
moderate
the
trouble
of
thy
heart
and
impart
thy
difficulties
to
me
oh
they
nothing
thanks
said
horace
feeling
decidedly
embarrassed
i
got
stuck
over
my
work
for
the
moment
and
it
worried
me
a
little
that
all
then
thou
hast
not
yet
received
the
gifts
which
i
commanded
should
be
delivered
at
thy
oh
indeed
i
have
replied
horace
and
and
i
really
do
know
how
to
thank
you
for
them
a
few
trifling
presents
answered
the
jinnee
and
by
no
means
suited
to
thy
dignity
yet
the
best
in
my
power
to
bestow
upon
thee
for
the
time
being
my
dear
sir
they
simply
overwhelm
me
with
their
magnificence
beyond
all
price
and
and
i
no
idea
what
to
do
with
such
a
superabundance
a
superfluity
of
good
things
is
good
was
the
jinnee
sententious
reply
not
in
my
particular
case
i
i
quite
feel
your
goodness
and
generosity
but
indeed
as
i
told
you
before
it
really
impossible
for
me
to
accept
any
such
reward
fakrash
brows
contracted
slightly
how
sayest
thou
that
it
is
impossible
seeing
that
these
things
are
already
in
thy
possession
i
know
said
horace
but
you
wo
be
offended
if
i
speak
quite
plainly
art
thou
not
even
as
a
son
to
me
and
can
i
be
angered
at
any
words
of
thine
well
said
horace
with
sudden
hope
honestly
then
i
would
very
much
rather
if
you
sure
you
do
mind
that
you
would
take
them
all
back
again
what
dost
thou
demand
that
i
should
consent
to
receive
back
the
gifts
i
have
bestowed
are
they
then
of
so
little
value
in
thy
sight
they
of
too
much
value
if
i
took
such
a
reward
for
for
a
very
ordinary
service
i
should
never
be
able
to
respect
myself
again
this
is
not
the
reasoning
of
an
intelligent
person
said
the
jinnee
coldly
if
you
think
me
a
fool
i
ca
help
it
i
not
an
ungrateful
fool
at
all
events
but
i
feel
very
strongly
that
i
ca
keep
these
gifts
of
yours
so
thou
wouldst
have
me
break
the
oath
which
i
swore
to
reward
thee
fitly
for
thy
kind
action
but
you
rewarded
me
already
said
horace
by
contriving
that
a
wealthy
merchant
should
engage
me
to
build
him
a
residence
and
forgive
my
plain
speaking
if
you
truly
desire
my
happiness
as
i
am
sure
you
do
you
will
relieve
me
of
all
these
precious
gems
and
merchandise
because
to
be
frank
they
will
make
me
happy
on
the
contrary
they
are
making
me
extremely
uncomfortable
in
the
days
of
old
said
fakrash
all
men
pursued
wealth
nor
could
any
amass
enough
to
satisfy
his
desires
have
riches
then
become
so
contemptible
in
mortal
eyes
that
thou
findest
them
but
an
encumbrance
explain
the
matter
horace
felt
a
natural
delicacy
in
giving
his
real
reasons
i
answer
for
other
men
he
said
all
i
know
is
that
i
never
been
accustomed
to
being
rich
and
i
rather
get
used
to
it
gradually
and
be
able
to
feel
that
i
owed
it
as
far
as
possible
to
my
own
exertions
for
as
i
need
tell
fakrash
riches
alone
do
make
any
fellow
happy
you
must
have
observed
that
they
apt
to
well
to
land
him
in
all
kinds
of
messes
and
worries
i
talking
like
a
confounded
copybook
he
thought
but
i
do
care
how
priggish
i
am
if
i
can
only
get
my
way
fakrash
was
deeply
impressed
o
young
man
of
marvellous
moderation
he
cried
thy
sentiments
are
not
inferior
to
those
of
the
great
suleyman
himself
on
whom
be
peace
yet
even
he
doth
not
utterly
despise
them
for
he
hath
gold
and
ivory
and
precious
stones
in
abundance
nor
hitherto
have
i
ever
met
a
human
being
capable
of
rejecting
them
when
offered
but
since
thou
seemest
sincere
in
holding
that
my
poor
and
paltry
gifts
will
not
advance
thy
welfare
and
since
i
would
do
thee
good
and
not
evil
be
it
even
as
thou
wouldst
for
excellently
was
it
said
worth
of
a
present
depends
not
on
itself
nor
on
the
giver
but
on
the
receiver
alone
horace
could
hardly
believe
that
he
had
really
prevailed
extremely
good
of
you
sir
he
said
to
take
it
so
well
and
if
you
let
that
caravan
call
for
them
as
soon
as
possible
it
would
be
a
great
convenience
to
me
i
mean
er
the
fact
is
i
expecting
a
few
friends
to
dine
with
me
and
as
my
rooms
are
rather
small
at
the
best
of
times
i
do
quite
know
how
i
can
manage
to
entertain
them
at
all
unless
something
is
done
it
will
be
the
easiest
of
actions
replied
fakrash
therefore
have
no
fear
that
when
the
time
cometh
thou
wilt
not
be
able
to
entertain
thy
friends
in
a
fitting
manner
and
for
the
caravan
it
shall
set
out
without
delay
by
jove
though
i
forgotten
one
thing
said
horace
i
locked
up
the
room
where
your
presents
are
they
wo
be
able
to
get
in
without
the
key
against
the
servants
of
the
jinn
neither
bolts
nor
bars
can
prevail
they
shall
enter
therein
and
remove
all
that
they
brought
thee
since
it
is
thy
desire
very
many
thanks
said
horace
and
you
do
understand
that
i
every
bit
as
grateful
as
if
i
could
keep
the
things
you
see
i
want
all
my
time
and
all
my
energies
to
complete
the
designs
for
this
building
which
he
added
gracefully
i
should
never
be
in
a
position
to
do
at
all
but
for
your
assistance
on
my
arrival
said
fakrash
i
heard
thee
lamenting
the
difficulties
of
the
task
wherein
do
they
consist
oh
said
horace
it
a
little
difficult
to
please
all
the
different
people
concerned
and
myself
too
i
want
to
make
something
of
it
that
i
shall
be
proud
of
and
that
will
give
me
a
reputation
it
a
large
house
and
there
will
be
a
good
deal
of
work
in
it
but
i
shall
manage
it
all
right
this
is
a
great
undertaking
indeed
remarked
the
jinnee
after
he
had
asked
various
by
no
means
unintelligent
questions
and
received
the
answers
but
be
persuaded
that
it
shall
all
turn
out
most
fortunately
and
thou
shalt
obtain
great
renown
and
now
he
concluded
i
am
compelled
to
take
leave
of
thee
for
i
am
still
without
any
certain
tidings
of
suleyman
you
must
let
me
keep
you
said
horace
who
had
been
on
thorns
for
some
minutes
lest
beevor
should
return
and
find
him
with
his
mysterious
visitor
you
see
he
added
instructively
so
long
as
you
neglect
your
own
much
more
important
affairs
to
look
after
mine
you
can
hardly
expect
to
make
progress
can
you
how
excellent
is
the
saying
replied
the
jinnee
time
which
is
spent
in
doing
kindnesses
call
it
not
wasted
yes
that
very
good
said
horace
feeling
driven
to
silence
this
maxim
if
possible
with
one
of
his
own
invention
but
have
a
saying
too
how
does
it
go
ah
i
remember
is
possible
for
a
kindness
to
be
more
inconvenient
than
an
injury
marvellously
gifted
was
he
who
discovered
such
a
saying
cried
fakrash
i
imagine
said
horace
he
learnt
it
from
his
own
experience
by
the
way
what
place
were
you
thinking
of
drawing
i
mean
trying
next
for
suleyman
i
purpose
to
repair
to
nineveh
and
inquire
there
capital
said
ventimore
with
hearty
approval
for
he
hoped
that
this
would
take
the
jinnee
some
little
time
wonderful
city
nineveh
from
all
i
heard
though
not
quite
what
it
used
to
be
perhaps
then
there
babylon
you
might
go
on
there
and
if
you
should
hear
of
him
there
why
not
strike
down
into
central
africa
and
do
that
thoroughly
or
south
america
it
a
pity
to
lose
any
chance
you
never
been
to
south
america
yet
i
have
not
so
much
as
heard
of
such
a
country
and
how
should
suleyman
be
there
pardon
me
i
did
say
he
there
all
i
meant
to
convey
was
that
he
quite
as
likely
to
be
there
as
anywhere
else
but
if
you
going
to
nineveh
first
you
better
lose
no
more
time
for
i
always
understood
that
it
rather
an
awkward
place
to
get
at
though
probably
wo
find
it
very
difficult
i
care
not
said
fakrash
though
the
search
be
long
for
in
travel
there
are
five
advantages
i
know
interrupted
horace
so
do
stop
to
describe
them
now
i
should
like
to
see
you
fairly
started
and
you
really
must
think
it
necessary
to
break
off
your
search
again
on
my
account
because
thanks
to
you
i
shall
get
on
splendidly
alone
for
the
future
if
you
kindly
see
that
that
merchandise
is
removed
thine
abode
shall
not
be
encumbered
with
it
for
another
hour
said
the
jinnee
o
thou
judicious
one
in
whose
estimation
wealth
is
of
no
value
know
that
i
have
never
encountered
a
mortal
who
pleased
me
as
thou
hast
and
moreover
be
assured
that
such
magnanimity
as
thine
shall
not
go
without
a
recompense
how
often
must
i
tell
you
said
horace
in
a
glow
of
impatience
that
i
am
already
much
more
than
recompensed
now
my
kind
generous
old
friend
he
added
with
an
emotion
that
was
not
wholly
insincere
the
time
has
come
to
bid
you
farewell
for
ever
let
me
picture
you
as
revisiting
your
former
haunts
penetrating
to
quarters
of
the
globe
for
whether
you
are
aware
of
it
or
not
this
earth
of
ours
a
globe
hitherto
unknown
to
you
refreshing
your
mind
by
foreign
travel
and
the
study
of
mankind
but
never
never
for
a
moment
losing
sight
of
your
main
object
the
eventual
discovery
of
and
reconciliation
with
suleyman
on
whom
be
peace
that
is
the
greatest
the
only
happiness
you
can
give
me
now
and
may
allah
never
deprive
thy
friends
of
thy
presence
returned
the
jinnee
who
was
apparently
touched
by
this
exordium
for
truly
thou
art
a
most
excellent
young
man
and
stepping
back
into
the
fireplace
he
was
gone
in
an
instant
ventimore
sank
back
in
his
chair
with
a
sigh
of
relief
he
had
begun
to
fear
that
the
jinnee
never
would
take
himself
off
but
he
had
gone
at
last
and
for
good
he
was
half
ashamed
of
himself
for
feeling
so
glad
for
fakrash
was
a
old
thing
enough
in
his
way
only
he
overdo
things
he
had
no
sense
of
proportion
why
thought
horace
if
a
fellow
expressed
a
modest
wish
for
a
canary
in
a
cage
he
just
the
sort
of
old
jinnee
to
bring
him
a
whole
covey
of
rocs
in
an
aviary
about
ten
times
the
size
of
the
crystal
palace
however
he
understand
now
that
i
ca
take
anything
more
from
him
and
he
is
offended
either
so
all
settled
now
i
can
set
to
work
and
knock
off
these
plans
in
peace
and
quietness
but
he
had
not
done
much
before
he
heard
sounds
in
the
next
room
which
told
him
that
beevor
had
returned
at
last
he
had
been
expected
back
from
the
country
for
the
last
day
or
two
and
it
was
fortunate
that
he
had
delayed
so
long
thought
ventimore
as
he
went
in
to
see
him
and
to
tell
him
the
unexpected
piece
of
good
fortune
that
he
himself
had
met
with
since
they
last
met
it
is
needless
to
say
that
in
giving
his
account
he
abstained
from
any
mention
of
the
brass
bottle
or
the
jinnee
as
unessential
elements
in
his
story
beevor
congratulations
were
quite
as
cordial
as
could
be
expected
as
soon
as
he
fully
understood
that
no
hoax
was
intended
well
old
man
he
said
i
glad
i
really
am
you
know
to
think
of
a
prize
like
that
coming
to
you
the
very
first
time
and
you
do
even
know
how
this
wackerbath
came
to
hear
of
you
just
happened
to
see
your
name
up
outside
and
came
in
i
expect
why
i
dare
say
if
i
had
chanced
to
go
away
as
i
did
and
about
a
couple
of
paltry
two
thousand
pound
houses
too
ah
well
i
do
grudge
you
your
luck
though
it
seem
rather
it
was
worth
waiting
for
you
be
cutting
out
before
long
if
you
do
make
a
mess
of
this
job
i
mean
you
know
old
chap
if
you
do
go
and
give
your
city
man
a
gothic
castle
when
what
he
wants
is
something
with
plenty
of
windows
and
a
corinthian
portico
that
the
rock
i
see
ahead
of
you
mind
my
giving
you
a
word
of
warning
oh
no
said
ventimore
but
i
sha
give
him
either
a
gothic
castle
or
plenty
of
i
venture
to
think
he
be
pleased
with
the
general
idea
as
i
working
it
out
let
hope
so
said
beevor
if
you
get
into
any
difficulty
you
know
he
added
with
a
touch
of
patronage
just
you
come
to
me
thanks
said
horace
i
will
but
i
getting
on
very
fairly
at
present
i
should
rather
like
to
see
what
you
made
of
it
i
might
be
able
to
give
you
a
wrinkle
here
and
there
it
awfully
good
of
you
but
i
think
i
rather
you
did
see
the
plans
till
they
quite
finished
said
horace
the
truth
was
that
he
was
perfectly
aware
that
the
other
would
not
be
in
sympathy
with
his
ideas
and
horace
who
had
just
been
suffering
from
a
cold
fit
of
depression
about
his
work
rather
shrank
from
any
kind
of
criticism
oh
just
as
you
please
said
beevor
a
little
stiffly
you
always
an
obstinate
beggar
i
had
a
certain
amount
of
experience
you
know
in
my
poor
little
pottering
way
and
i
thought
i
might
possibly
have
saved
you
a
cropper
or
two
but
if
you
think
you
can
manage
better
alone
only
do
get
bolted
with
by
one
of
those
architectural
hobbies
of
yours
that
all
all
right
old
fellow
i
ride
my
hobby
on
the
curb
said
horace
laughing
as
he
went
back
to
his
own
office
where
he
found
that
all
his
former
certainty
and
enjoyment
of
his
work
had
returned
to
him
and
by
the
end
of
the
day
he
had
made
so
much
progress
that
his
designs
needed
only
a
few
finishing
touches
to
be
complete
enough
for
his
inspection
better
still
on
returning
to
his
rooms
that
evening
to
change
before
going
to
kensington
he
found
that
the
admirable
fakrash
had
kept
his
promise
every
chest
sack
and
bale
had
been
cleared
away
them
camels
come
back
for
the
things
this
afternoon
sir
said
rapkin
and
it
put
me
in
a
fluster
at
first
for
i
made
sure
locked
your
door
and
took
the
key
but
i
must
have
been
mistook
leastways
them
arabs
got
in
somehow
i
hope
you
meant
everything
to
go
back
quite
said
horace
i
saw
the
the
person
who
sent
them
this
morning
and
told
him
there
was
nothing
i
cared
for
enough
to
keep
and
like
his
impidence
sending
you
a
lot
o
rubbish
like
that
on
approval
and
on
camels
too
declared
rapkin
i
sure
i
know
what
them
advertising
firms
will
try
next
pushing
call
it
now
that
everything
was
gone
horace
felt
a
little
natural
regret
and
doubt
whether
he
need
have
been
quite
so
uncompromising
in
his
refusal
of
the
treasures
i
might
have
kept
some
of
those
tissues
and
things
for
sylvia
he
thought
and
she
loves
pearls
and
a
would
have
pleased
the
professor
tremendously
but
no
after
all
it
would
have
done
sylvia
could
go
about
in
pearls
the
size
of
new
potatoes
and
the
professor
would
only
have
ragged
me
for
more
reckless
extravagance
besides
if
i
taken
any
of
the
jinnee
gifts
he
might
keep
on
pouring
more
in
till
i
should
be
just
where
i
was
before
or
worse
off
really
because
i
could
decently
refuse
them
then
so
it
best
as
it
is
and
really
considering
his
temperament
and
the
peculiar
nature
of
his
position
it
is
not
easy
to
see
how
he
could
have
arrived
at
any
other
conclusion
chapter
viii
bachelor
quarters
horace
was
feeling
particularly
happy
as
he
walked
back
the
next
evening
to
vincent
square
he
had
the
consciousness
of
having
done
a
good
work
for
the
for
wackerbath
mansion
were
actually
completed
and
despatched
to
his
business
address
while
ventimore
now
felt
a
comfortable
assurance
that
his
designs
would
more
than
satisfy
his
client
but
it
was
not
that
which
made
him
so
light
of
heart
that
night
his
rooms
were
to
be
honoured
for
the
first
time
by
sylvia
presence
she
would
tread
upon
his
carpet
sit
in
his
chairs
comment
upon
and
perhaps
even
handle
his
books
and
ornaments
and
all
of
them
would
retain
something
of
her
charm
for
ever
after
if
she
only
came
for
even
now
he
could
not
quite
believe
that
she
really
would
that
some
untoward
event
would
not
make
a
point
of
happening
to
prevent
her
as
he
sometimes
doubted
whether
his
engagement
was
not
too
sweet
and
wonderful
to
be
true
or
at
all
events
to
last
as
to
the
dinner
his
mind
was
tolerably
easy
for
he
had
settled
the
remaining
details
of
the
with
his
landlady
that
morning
and
he
could
hope
that
without
being
so
sumptuous
as
to
excite
the
wrath
it
would
still
be
not
altogether
unworthy
and
what
goods
could
be
rare
and
dainty
enough
to
be
set
before
sylvia
he
would
have
liked
to
provide
champagne
but
he
knew
that
wine
would
savour
of
ostentation
in
the
professor
judgment
so
he
had
contented
himself
instead
with
claret
a
sound
vintage
which
he
knew
he
could
depend
upon
flowers
he
thought
were
clearly
permissible
and
he
had
called
at
a
florist
on
his
way
and
got
some
chrysanthemums
of
palest
yellow
and
deepest
the
finest
he
could
see
some
of
them
would
look
well
on
the
centre
of
the
table
in
an
old
nankin
bowl
he
had
the
rest
he
could
arrange
about
the
room
there
would
just
be
time
to
see
to
all
that
before
dressing
occupied
with
these
thoughts
he
turned
into
vincent
square
which
looked
vaster
than
ever
with
the
murky
haze
enclosed
by
its
high
railings
and
under
a
wide
expanse
of
sky
across
which
the
clouds
were
driving
fast
like
ships
in
full
sail
scudding
for
harbour
before
a
storm
against
the
mist
below
the
young
and
nearly
leafless
trees
showed
flat
black
profiles
as
of
pressed
seaweed
and
the
sky
immediately
above
the
was
tinged
with
a
sullen
red
from
miles
of
lighted
streets
from
the
river
came
the
tooting
of
tugs
mingled
with
the
more
distant
wail
and
hysterical
shrieks
of
railway
engines
on
the
lambeth
lines
and
now
he
reached
the
old
house
in
which
he
lodged
and
noticed
for
the
first
time
how
the
of
the
veranda
made
with
the
bared
creepers
and
hanging
baskets
a
kind
of
decorative
pattern
against
the
windows
which
were
suffused
with
a
roseate
glow
that
looked
warm
and
comfortable
and
hospitable
he
wondered
whether
sylvia
would
notice
it
when
she
arrived
he
passed
under
the
old
arch
that
once
held
an
and
up
a
short
but
rather
steep
flight
of
steps
which
led
to
a
brick
porch
built
out
at
the
side
then
he
let
himself
in
and
stood
spellbound
with
perplexed
amazement
for
he
was
in
a
strange
house
in
place
of
the
modest
passage
with
the
yellow
marble
the
mahogany
and
the
elderly
barometer
in
a
state
of
chronic
depression
which
he
knew
so
well
he
found
an
arched
octagonal
with
arabesques
of
blue
crimson
and
gold
and
hangings
the
floor
was
marble
and
from
a
shallow
basin
of
alabaster
in
the
centre
a
perfumed
fountain
rose
and
fell
with
a
lulling
patter
i
must
have
mistaken
the
number
he
thought
quite
forgetting
that
his
had
fitted
and
he
was
just
about
to
retreat
before
his
intrusion
was
discovered
when
the
hangings
parted
and
rapkin
presented
herself
making
so
deplorably
incongruous
a
figure
in
such
surroundings
and
looking
so
bewildered
and
woebegone
that
horace
in
spite
of
his
own
increasing
uneasiness
had
some
difficulty
in
keeping
his
gravity
oh
ventimore
sir
she
lamented
whatever
you
go
and
do
next
i
wonder
to
think
of
your
going
and
having
the
whole
place
done
up
and
altered
out
of
knowledge
like
this
without
a
word
of
warning
if
any
halterations
were
required
i
think
as
me
and
rapkin
had
the
right
to
be
consulted
horace
let
all
his
chrysanthemums
drop
unheeded
into
the
fountain
he
understood
now
indeed
he
seemed
in
some
way
to
have
understood
almost
from
the
first
only
he
would
not
admit
it
even
to
himself
the
irrepressible
jinnee
was
at
the
bottom
of
this
of
course
he
remembered
now
having
made
that
unfortunate
remark
the
day
before
about
the
limited
accommodation
his
rooms
afforded
clearly
fakrash
must
have
taken
a
mental
note
of
it
and
with
that
insatiable
munificence
which
was
one
of
his
worst
failings
had
determined
by
way
of
a
pleasant
surprise
to
entirely
refurnish
and
redecorate
the
apartments
according
to
his
own
ideas
it
was
extremely
kind
of
him
it
showed
a
truly
grateful
disposition
but
oh
as
horace
thought
in
the
bitterness
of
his
soul
if
he
would
only
learn
to
let
well
alone
and
mind
his
own
business
however
the
thing
was
done
now
and
he
must
accept
the
responsibility
for
it
since
he
could
hardly
disclose
the
truth
did
i
mention
i
was
having
some
alterations
made
he
said
carelessly
they
got
the
work
done
rather
sooner
than
i
expected
were
were
they
long
over
it
i
sure
i
ca
tell
you
sir
having
stepped
out
to
get
some
things
i
wanted
in
for
and
rapkin
he
was
round
the
corner
at
his
and
when
i
come
back
it
was
all
done
and
the
workmen
gone
and
how
they
could
have
finished
such
a
job
in
the
time
beats
me
altogether
for
when
we
the
men
in
to
do
the
back
kitchen
they
took
ten
days
over
it
well
said
horace
evading
this
point
however
they
done
this
they
done
it
remarkably
well
you
admit
that
mrs
rapkin
that
as
may
be
sir
said
rapkin
with
a
sniff
but
it
taste
nor
yet
i
do
think
it
will
be
rapkin
taste
when
he
comes
to
see
it
it
was
not
ventimore
taste
either
though
he
was
not
going
to
confess
it
sorry
for
that
rapkin
he
said
but
i
no
time
to
talk
about
it
now
i
must
rush
upstairs
and
dress
begging
your
pardon
sir
but
that
a
total
unpossibility
for
been
and
took
away
the
staircase
taken
away
the
staircase
nonsense
cried
horace
so
think
ventimore
but
it
what
them
men
have
done
and
if
you
do
believe
me
come
and
see
for
yourself
she
drew
the
hangings
aside
and
revealed
to
ventimore
astonished
gaze
a
vast
pillared
hall
with
a
lofty
domed
roof
from
which
hung
several
lamps
diffusing
a
subdued
radiance
high
up
in
the
wall
on
his
left
were
the
two
windows
which
he
judged
to
have
formerly
belonged
to
his
for
either
from
delicacy
or
inability
or
simply
because
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
the
jinnee
had
not
interfered
with
the
external
structure
but
the
windows
were
now
masked
by
a
perforated
and
gilded
lattice
which
accounted
for
the
pattern
horace
had
noticed
from
without
the
walls
were
covered
with
oriental
tiles
and
a
raised
platform
of
alabaster
on
which
were
divans
ran
round
two
sides
of
the
hall
while
the
side
opposite
to
him
was
pierced
with
arches
apparently
leading
to
other
apartments
the
centre
of
the
marble
floor
was
spread
with
costly
rugs
and
piles
of
cushions
their
rich
hues
glowing
through
the
gold
with
which
they
were
intricately
embroidered
well
said
the
unhappy
horace
scarcely
knowing
what
he
was
saying
it
it
all
looks
very
mrs
rapkin
it
not
for
me
to
say
sir
but
i
should
like
to
know
where
you
thought
of
dining
where
said
horace
why
here
of
course
there
plenty
of
room
there
is
a
table
left
in
the
house
said
rapkin
so
unless
you
wish
the
cloth
laid
on
the
floor
oh
there
must
be
a
table
somewhere
said
horace
impatiently
or
you
can
borrow
one
do
difficulties
rapkin
rig
up
anything
you
like
now
i
must
be
off
and
dress
he
got
rid
of
her
and
on
entering
one
of
the
archways
discovered
a
smaller
room
in
encrusted
with
ivory
and
which
was
evidently
his
bedroom
a
gorgeous
robe
stiff
with
gold
and
glittering
with
ancient
gems
was
laid
out
for
him
for
the
jinnee
had
thought
of
everything
but
ventimore
naturally
preferred
his
own
evening
clothes
mr
rapkin
he
shouted
going
to
another
arch
that
seemed
to
communicate
with
the
basement
sir
replied
his
landlord
who
had
just
returned
from
his
and
now
appeared
without
a
tie
and
in
his
looking
pale
and
wild
as
was
perhaps
intelligible
in
the
circumstances
as
he
entered
his
unfamiliar
marble
halls
he
staggered
and
his
red
eyes
rolled
and
his
mouth
gaped
in
a
fashion
they
been
at
it
too
he
remarked
huskily
there
have
been
a
few
changes
said
horace
quietly
as
you
can
see
you
do
happen
to
know
where
they
put
my
do
you
i
do
to
know
where
they
put
nothink
your
dress
clothes
why
i
dunno
where
they
bin
and
put
our
little
parler
where
me
and
maria
set
of
a
hevenin
all
these
years
regular
i
dunno
where
they
put
the
pantry
nor
yet
the
with
and
cold

he
waved

and
sat
down
suddenly
upon
the
marble
floor

stand
on
anything

or
can
said
horace

rapkin
cautiously
regaining
his
feet
there
no
mishtaking
a
a
of
course
you
are
said
horace
genially
and
i
tell
you
how
going
to
show
it
you
going
straight
downstairs
to
get
your
good
wife
to
pour
some
cold
water
over
your
head
and
then
you
will
finish
dressing
see
what
you
can
do
to
get
a
table
of
some
sort
and
lay
it
for
dinner
and
be
ready
to
announce
my
friends
when
they
arrive
and
wait
afterwards
do
you
see
that
will
be
all
ri
ventimore
said
rapkin
who
was
not
far
gone
enough
to
be
beyond
understanding
or
obeying
you
leave
it
entirely
to
me
i
unnertake
that
your
friends
shall
be
made
comforrable
perfelly
comforrable
i
lived
as

in

tryin
to
and
and
everything
was
always
all

and
shall
be
all
ri
in
a
few
minutes
with
this
assurance
he
stumbled
downstairs
leaving
horace
relieved
to
some
extent
rapkin
would
be
sober
enough
after
his
head
had
been
under
the
tap
for
a
few
minutes
and
in
any
case
there
would
be
the
hired
waiter
to
rely
upon
if
he
could
only
find
out
where
his
evening
clothes
were
he
returned
to
his
room
and
made
another
frantic
search
but
they
were
nowhere
to
be
found
and
as
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
receive
his
guests
in
his
ordinary
morning
costume
which
the
professor
would
probably
construe
as
a
deliberate
slight
and
which
would
certainly
seem
a
solecism
in
futvoye
eyes
if
not
in
her
daughter
he
decided
to
put
on
the
eastern
robes
with
the
exception
of
a
turban
which
he
could
not
manage
to
wind
round
his
head
thus
arrayed
he
the
domed
hall
where
he
was
annoyed
to
find
that
no
attempt
had
been
made
as
yet
to
prepare
a
and
he
was
just
looking
forlornly
round
for
a
bell
when
rapkin
appeared
he
had
apparently
followed
horace
advice
for
his
hair
looked
wet
and
sleek
and
he
was
comparatively
sober
this
is
too
bad
cried
horace
my
friends
may
be
here
at
any
moment
now
and
nothing
done
you
do
propose
to
wait
at
table
like
that
do
you
he
added
as
he
noted
the
man
overcoat
and
the
comforter
round
his
throat
i
do
not
propose
to
wait
in
any
garments
whatsoever
said
rapkin
out
i
am
very
well
said
horace
then
send
the
waiter
up
i
suppose
come
he
come
but
he
went
away
again
i
told
him
as
he
would
be
required
you
told
him
that
horace
said
angrily
and
then
controlled
himself
come
rapkin
be
reasonable
you
ca
really
mean
to
leave
your
wife
to
cook
the
dinner
and
serve
it
too
she
ai
intending
to
do
neither
she
left
the
house
already
you
must
fetch
her
back
cried
horace
good
heavens
man
you
see
what
a
fix
you
leaving
me
in
my
friends
have
started
long
ago
it
too
late
to
wire
to
them
or
make
any
other
arrangements
there
was
a
knock
as
he
spoke
at
the
front
door
and
odd
enough
was
the
familiar
sound
of
the
knocker
in
that
arabian
hall
there
they
are
he
said
and
the
idea
of
meeting
them
at
the
door
and
proposing
an
instant
adjournment
to
a
restaurant
occurred
to
him
till
he
suddenly
recollected
that
he
would
have
to
change
and
try
to
find
some
money
even
for
that
for
the
last
time
rapkin
he
cried
in
despair
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
there
no
dinner
ready
oh
said
rapkin
there
dinner
right
enough
and
a
lot
o
barbarious
furriners
downstairs
a
cookin
of
it
that
what
broke
maria
to
see
it
all
took
out
of
her
after
the
trouble
she
gone
to
but
i
must
have
somebody
to
wait
exclaimed
horace
you
got
waiters
enough
as
far
as
that
goes
but
if
you
expect
a
hordinary
christian
man
to
wait
along
of
a
lot
o
narsty
niggers
and
be
at
their
beck
and
call
you
mistook
sir
for
i
going
to
sleep
the
night
at
my
and
take
his
advice
he
bein
a
doorkeeper
at
a
solicitor
orfice
and
knowing
the
law
about
this
business
and
so
i
wish
you
a
good
hevening
and
your
dinner
will
be
to
your
liking
and
satisfaction
he
went
out
by
the
farther
archway
while
from
the
horace
could
hear
voices
he
knew
only
too
well
the
futvoyes
had
come
well
at
all
events
it
seemed
that
there
would
be
something
for
them
to
eat
since
fakrash
in
his
anxiety
to
do
the
thing
thoroughly
had
furnished
both
the
feast
and
attendance
himself
but
who
was
there
to
announce
the
guests
where
were
these
waiters
rapkin
had
spoken
of
ought
he
to
go
and
bring
in
his
visitors
himself
these
questions
answered
themselves
the
next
instant
for
as
he
stood
there
under
the
dome
the
curtains
of
the
central
arch
were
drawn
with
a
rattle
and
disclosed
a
double
line
of
tall
slaves
in
rich
raiment
their
onyx
eyes
rolling
and
their
teeth
flashing
in
their
countenances
as
they
salaamed
between
this
double
line
stood
professor
and
futvoye
and
sylvia
who
had
just
removed
their
wraps
and
were
gazing
in
undisguised
astonishment
on
the
splendours
which
met
their
view
horace
advanced
to
receive
them
he
felt
he
was
in
for
it
now
and
the
only
course
left
him
was
to
put
as
good
a
face
as
he
could
on
the
matter
and
trust
to
luck
to
pull
him
through
without
discovery
or
disaster
chapter
ix
persicos
odi
puer
apparatus
so
you
found
your
way
here
at
last
said
horace
as
he
shook
hands
heartily
with
the
professor
and
futvoye
i
ca
tell
you
how
delighted
i
am
to
see
you
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
was
very
far
from
being
at
ease
which
made
him
rather
but
he
was
determined
that
if
he
could
help
it
he
would
not
betray
the
slightest
consciousness
of
anything
or
unusual
in
his
domestic
arrangements
and
these
said
futvoye
who
was
extremely
stately
in
black
with
old
lace
and
steel
embroidery
these
are
the
bachelor
lodgings
you
were
so
modest
about
really
she
added
with
a
humorous
twinkle
in
her
shrewd
eyes
you
young
men
seem
to
understand
how
to
make
yourselves
comfortable
do
they
anthony
they
do
indeed
said
the
professor
dryly
though
it
manifestly
cost
him
some
effort
to
conceal
his
appreciation
to
produce
such
results
as
these
must
if
i
mistake
not
have
entailed
infinite
research
and
considerable
expense
no
said
horace
no
you
you
be
surprised
if
you
knew
how
little
i
should
have
imagined
retorted
the
professor
that
outlay
on
apartments
which
i
presume
you
do
not
contemplate
occupying
for
an
extended
period
must
be
money
thrown
away
but
doubtless
you
know
best
but
your
rooms
are
quite
wonderful
horace
cried
sylvia
her
charming
eyes
dilating
with
admiration
and
where
did
you
get
that
magnificent
i
never
saw
anything
so
lovely
in
my
life
she
herself
was
lovely
enough
in
a
billowy
shimmering
frock
of
a
delicate
hue
her
only
ornament
a
egyptian
scarab
with
spread
wings
which
was
suspended
from
her
neck
by
a
slender
gold
chain
i
i
ought
to
apologise
for
receiving
you
in
this
costume
said
horace
with
embarrassment
but
the
fact
is
i
could
find
my
evening
clothes
anywhere
so
so
i
put
on
the
first
things
that
came
to
hand
it
is
hardly
necessary
said
the
professor
conscious
of
being
correctly
clad
and
unconscious
that
his
was
bulging
and
his
white
tie
beginning
to
work
up
towards
his
left
jaw
hardly
necessary
to
offer
any
apology
for
the
simplicity
of
your
costume
which
is
entirely
in
keeping
with
the
ah
strictly
oriental
character
of
your
interior
feel
dreadfully
out
of
keeping
said
sylvia
for
there
nothing
in
the
least
oriental
about
unless
it
my
scarab
and
he
i
do
know
how
many
centuries
behind
the
time
poor
dear
if
you
said
of
years
my
dear
corrected
the
professor
you
would
be
more
accurate
that
scarab
was
taken
out
of
a
tomb
of
the
thirteenth
dynasty
well
i
sure
he
rather
be
where
he
is
said
sylvia
and
ventimore
entirely
agreed
with
her
horace
i
look
at
everything
how
clever
and
original
of
you
to
transform
an
ordinary
london
house
into
this
oh
well
you
see
explained
horace
it
it
was
exactly
done
by
me
whoever
did
it
said
the
professor
must
have
devoted
considerable
study
to
eastern
art
and
architecture
may
i
ask
the
name
of
the
firm
who
executed
the
alterations
i
really
could
tell
you
sir
answered
horace
who
was
beginning
to
understand
how
very
bad
a
quart
can
be
you
ca
tell
me
exclaimed
the
professor
you
order
these
extensive
and
should
say
expensive
decorations
and
you
do
know
the
firm
you
selected
to
carry
them
out
of
course
i
said
horace
only
i
do
happen
to
remember
at
this
moment
let
me
see
now
was
it
liberty
no
i
almost
certain
it
was
liberty
it
might
have
been
maple
but
i
not
sure
whoever
did
do
it
they
were
marvellously
cheap
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
said
the
professor
in
his
most
unpleasant
tone
where
is
your
why
i
rather
think
said
horace
helplessly
as
he
saw
a
train
of
attendants
laying
a
round
cloth
on
the
floor
i
rather
think
is
the
you
appear
to
be
in
some
doubt
said
the
professor
i
leave
it
to
them
it
depends
where
they
choose
to
lay
the
cloth
said
horace
sometimes
in
one
place
sometimes
in
another
there
a
great
charm
in
uncertainty
he
faltered
doubtless
said
the
professor
by
this
time
two
of
the
slaves
under
the
direction
of
a
tall
and
turbaned
black
had
set
a
low
ebony
stool
inlaid
with
silver
and
tortoiseshell
in
strange
devices
on
the
round
carpet
when
other
attendants
followed
with
a
circular
silver
tray
containing
covered
dishes
which
they
placed
on
the
stool
and
salaamed
your
ah
groom
of
the
chambers
said
the
professor
seems
to
have
decided
that
we
should
dine
here
i
observe
they
are
making
signs
to
you
that
the
food
is
on
the
table
so
it
is
said
ventimore
shall
we
sit
down
but
my
dear
horace
said
futvoye
your
butler
has
forgotten
the
chairs
you
do
appear
to
realise
my
dear
said
the
professor
that
in
such
an
interior
as
this
chairs
would
be
hopelessly
incongruous
i
afraid
there
are
any
said
horace
for
there
was
nothing
but
four
fat
cushions
let
sit
down
on
these
he
proposed
it
more
fun
at
my
time
of
life
said
the
professor
irritably
as
he
let
himself
down
on
the
plumpest
cushion
such
fun
as
may
be
derived
from
eating
one
meals
on
the
floor
fails
to
appeal
to
my
sense
of
humour
however
i
admit
that
it
is
thoroughly
oriental
think
it
delightful
said
sylvia
ever
so
much
nicer
than
a
stiff
conventional
one
may
be
unconventional
remarked
her
father
without
escaping
the
penalty
of
stiffness
go
away
sir
go
away
he
added
snappishly
to
one
of
the
slaves
who
was
attempting
to
pour
water
over
his
hands
your
servant
ventimore
appears
to
imagine
that
i
go
out
to
dinner
without
taking
the
trouble
to
wash
my
hands
previously
this
i
may
mention
is
the
case
it
only
an
eastern
ceremony
professor
said
horace
i
am
perfectly
well
aware
of
what
is
customary
in
the
east
retorted
the
professor
it
does
not
follow
that
such
ah
hygienic
precautions
are
either
necessary
or
desirable
at
a
western
table
horace
made
no
reply
he
was
too
much
occupied
in
gazing
blankly
at
the
silver
and
wondering
what
in
the
world
might
be
underneath
nor
was
his
perplexity
relieved
when
the
covers
were
removed
for
he
was
quite
at
a
loss
to
guess
how
he
was
supposed
to
help
the
contents
without
so
much
as
a
fork
the
chief
attendant
however
solved
that
difficulty
by
intimating
in
pantomime
that
the
guests
were
expected
to
use
their
fingers
sylvia
accomplished
this
daintily
and
with
intense
amusement
but
her
father
and
mother
made
no
secret
of
their
repugnance
if
i
were
dining
in
the
desert
with
a
sheik
sir
observed
the
professor
i
should
i
hope
know
how
to
conform
to
his
habits
and
prejudices
here
in
the
heart
of
london
i
confess
all
this
strikes
me
as
a
piece
of
needless
pedantry
i
very
sorry
said
horace
i
have
some
knives
and
forks
if
i
could
but
i
afraid
these
fellows
do
even
understand
what
they
are
so
it
useless
to
order
any
we
we
must
rough
it
a
little
that
all
i
hope
that
er
fish
is
all
right
professor
he
did
not
know
precisely
what
kind
of
fish
it
was
but
it
was
fried
in
oil
of
sesame
and
flavoured
with
a
mixture
of
cinnamon
and
ginger
and
the
professor
did
not
appear
to
be
making
much
progress
with
it
ventimore
himself
would
have
infinitely
preferred
the
original
cod
and
oyster
sauce
but
that
could
not
be
helped
now
thank
you
said
the
professor
it
is
curious
but
characteristic
not
more
thank
you
horace
could
only
trust
that
the
next
course
would
be
more
of
a
success
it
was
a
dish
of
mutton
stewed
with
peaches
jujubes
and
sugar
which
sylvia
declared
was
delicious
her
parents
made
no
comment
might
i
ask
for
something
to
drink
said
the
professor
presently
whereupon
a
cupbearer
poured
him
a
goblet
of
iced
sherbet
perfumed
with
conserve
of
violets
i
very
sorry
my
dear
fellow
he
said
after
sipping
it
but
if
i
drink
this
i
shall
be
ill
all
next
day
if
i
might
have
a
glass
of
wine
another
slave
instantly
handed
him
a
cup
of
wine
which
he
tasted
and
set
down
with
a
wry
face
and
a
shudder
horace
tried
some
afterwards
and
was
not
surprised
it
was
a
strong
harsh
wine
in
which
goatskin
and
resin
struggled
for
predominance
it
an
old
and
i
make
no
doubt
a
fine
wine
observed
the
professor
with
studied
politeness
but
i
fancy
it
must
have
suffered
in
transportation
i
really
think
that
with
my
gouty
tendency
a
little
whisky
and
apollinaris
would
be
better
for
me
if
you
keep
such
occidental
fluids
in
the
house
horace
felt
convinced
that
it
would
be
useless
to
order
the
slaves
to
bring
whisky
or
apollinaris
which
were
of
course
unknown
in
the
jinnee
time
so
he
could
do
nothing
but
apologise
for
their
absence
no
matter
said
the
professor
i
am
not
so
thirsty
that
i
can
not
wait
till
i
get
home
it
was
some
consolation
that
both
sylvia
and
her
mother
commended
the
sherbet
and
even
appreciated
or
were
so
obliging
as
to
say
they
appreciated
the
which
consisted
of
rice
and
mincemeat
wrapped
in
and
certainly
was
not
appetising
in
appearance
besides
being
difficult
to
dispose
of
gracefully
it
was
followed
by
a
whole
lamb
fried
in
oil
stuffed
with
pounded
pistachio
nuts
pepper
nutmeg
and
coriander
seeds
and
liberally
besprinkled
with
and
musk
only
horace
had
sufficient
courage
to
attack
the
lamb
and
he
found
reason
to
regret
it
afterwards
came
fowls
stuffed
with
raisins
parsley
and
crumbled
bread
and
the
banquet
ended
with
pastry
of
weird
forms
and
repellent
aspect
i
hope
said
horace
anxiously
you
do
find
this
eastern
cookery
very
er
unpalatable
he
himself
was
feeling
distinctly
unwell
rather
a
change
from
the
ordinary
routine
i
have
made
a
truly
wonderful
dinner
thank
you
replied
the
professor
not
it
is
to
be
feared
without
intention
even
in
the
east
i
have
eaten
nothing
approaching
this
but
where
did
your
landlady
pick
up
this
extraordinary
cooking
my
dear
horace
said
futvoye
i
thought
you
said
she
was
merely
a
plain
cook
has
she
ever
lived
in
the
east
not
exactly
the
east
exclaimed
horace
not
what
you
would
call
there
the
fact
is
he
continued
feeling
that
he
was
in
danger
of
drivelling
and
that
he
had
better
be
as
candid
as
he
could
this
dinner
cooked
by
her
she
she
was
obliged
to
go
away
quite
suddenly
so
the
dinner
was
all
sent
in
by
by
a
sort
of
contractor
you
know
he
supplies
the
whole
thing
waiters
and
all
i
was
thinking
said
the
professor
that
for
a
bachelor
an
bachelor
you
seemed
to
maintain
rather
a
large
establishment
oh
they
only
here
for
the
evening
sir
said
horace
capital
fellows
more
picturesque
than
the
local
greengrocer
and
they
breathe
on
the
top
of
your
head
they
perfect
dears
horace
remarked
sylvia
only
well
just
a
to
look
at
it
would
ill
become
me
to
criticise
the
style
and
method
of
our
entertainment
put
in
the
professor
acidly
otherwise
i
might
be
tempted
to
observe
that
it
scarcely
showed
that
regard
for
economy
which
i
should
have
now
anthony
put
in
his
wife
do
let
us
have
any
i
sure
horace
has
done
it
all
delightfully
yes
delightfully
and
even
if
he
been
just
a
little
extravagant
it
not
as
if
he
was
obliged
to
be
as
economical
you
know
my
dear
said
the
professor
i
have
yet
to
learn
that
the
prospect
of
an
increased
income
in
the
remote
future
is
any
justification
for
reckless
profusion
in
the
present
if
you
only
knew
said
horace
you
would
call
it
profusion
it
it
not
at
all
the
dinner
i
meant
it
to
be
and
i
afraid
it
was
particularly
nice
but
it
certainly
not
expensive
expensive
is
of
course
a
very
relative
term
but
i
think
i
have
the
right
to
ask
whether
this
is
the
footing
on
which
you
propose
to
begin
your
married
life
it
was
an
extremely
awkward
question
as
the
reader
will
perceive
if
ventimore
replied
as
he
might
with
truth
that
he
had
no
intention
whatever
of
maintaining
his
wife
in
luxury
such
as
that
he
stood
convicted
of
selfish
indulgence
as
a
bachelor
if
on
the
other
hand
he
declared
that
he
propose
to
maintain
his
wife
in
the
same
fantastic
and
exaggerated
splendour
as
the
present
it
would
certainly
confirm
her
father
disbelief
in
his
prudence
and
economy
and
it
was
that
egregious
old
ass
of
a
jinnee
as
horace
thought
with
suppressed
rage
who
had
let
him
in
for
all
this
and
who
was
now
far
beyond
all
remonstrance
or
reproach
before
he
could
bring
himself
to
answer
the
question
the
attendants
had
noiselessly
removed
the
tray
and
stool
and
were
handing
round
rosewater
in
a
silver
ewer
and
basin
the
character
of
which
luckily
or
otherwise
turned
the
professor
inquisitiveness
into
a
different
channel
these
are
not
bad
really
not
bad
at
all
he
said
inspecting
the
design
where
did
you
manage
to
pick
them
up
i
did
said
horace
they
provided
by
the
the
person
who
supplies
the
dinner
can
you
give
me
his
address
said
the
professor
scenting
a
bargain
because
really
you
know
these
things
are
probably
antiques
much
too
good
to
be
used
for
business
purposes
i
wrong
said
horace
lamely
these
particular
things
are
are
lent
by
an
eccentric
oriental
gentleman
as
a
great
favour
do
i
know
him
is
he
a
collector
of
such
things
you
would
have
met
him
he
he
lived
a
very
retired
life
of
late
i
should
very
much
like
to
see
his
collection
if
you
could
give
me
a
letter
of
introduction
no
said
horace
in
a
state
of
prickly
heat
it
would
be
any
use
his
collection
is
never
shown
he
he
a
most
peculiar
man
and
just
now
he
abroad
ah
pardon
me
if
i
been
indiscreet
but
i
concluded
from
what
you
said
that
this
ah
banquet
was
furnished
by
a
professional
caterer
oh
the
banquet
yes
came
from
the
stores
said
horace
mendaciously
the
the
oriental
cookery
department
they
just
started
it
you
know
so
so
i
thought
i
give
them
a
trial
but
not
what
i
call
properly
organised
yet
the
slaves
were
now
with
low
obeisances
inviting
them
to
seat
themselves
on
the
divan
which
lined
part
of
the
hall
ha
said
the
professor
as
he
rose
from
his
cushion
cracking
audibly
so
we
to
have
our
coffee
and
what
not
over
there
hey
well
my
boy
i
sha
be
sorry
i
confess
to
have
something
to
lean
my
back
against
and
a
cigar
a
mild
cigar
will
ah
aid
digestion
you
smoke
here
smoke
said
horace
why
of
course
all
over
the
place
here
he
said
clapping
his
hands
which
brought
an
obsequious
slave
instantly
to
his
side
just
bring
coffee
and
cigars
will
you
the
slave
rolled
his
eyes
in
obvious
perplexity
coffee
said
horace
you
must
know
what
coffee
is
and
cigarettes
well
then
if
that
what
you
call
them
but
the
slave
clearly
did
not
understand
and
it
suddenly
struck
horace
that
since
and
coffee
were
not
introduced
even
in
the
east
till
long
after
the
jinnee
time
he
as
the
founder
of
the
feast
would
naturally
be
unaware
how
indispensable
they
had
become
at
the
present
day
i
really
awfully
sorry
he
said
but
they
do
seem
to
have
provided
any
i
shall
speak
to
the
manager
about
it
and
unfortunately
i
do
know
where
my
own
cigars
are
it
of
no
consequence
said
the
professor
with
the
sort
of
stoicism
that
minds
very
much
i
am
a
moderate
smoker
at
best
and
turkish
coffee
though
delicious
is
apt
to
keep
me
awake
but
if
you
could
let
me
have
a
look
at
that
brass
bottle
you
got
at
poor
collingham
sale
i
should
be
obliged
to
you
horace
had
no
idea
where
it
was
then
nor
could
he
until
the
professor
came
to
the
rescue
with
a
few
words
of
arabic
manage
to
make
the
slaves
comprehend
what
he
wished
them
to
find
at
length
however
two
of
them
appeared
bearing
the
brass
bottle
with
every
sign
of
awe
and
depositing
it
at
ventimore
feet
professor
futvoye
after
wiping
and
adjusting
his
glasses
proceeded
to
examine
the
vessel
it
certainly
is
a
most
unusual
type
of
brassware
he
said
as
unique
in
its
way
as
the
silver
ewer
and
basin
and
as
you
thought
there
does
seem
to
be
something
resembling
an
inscription
on
the
cap
though
in
this
dim
light
it
is
almost
impossible
to
be
sure
while
he
was
poring
over
it
horace
seated
himself
on
the
divan
by
sylvia
side
hoping
for
one
of
the
whispered
conversations
permitted
to
affianced
lovers
he
had
pulled
through
the
banquet
somehow
and
on
the
whole
he
felt
thankful
things
had
not
gone
off
worse
the
noiseless
and
uncanny
attendants
whom
he
did
not
know
whether
to
regard
as
efreets
or
demons
or
simply
illusions
but
whose
services
he
had
no
wish
to
retain
had
all
withdrawn
futvoye
was
peacefully
slumbering
and
her
husband
was
in
a
better
humour
than
he
had
been
all
the
evening
suddenly
from
behind
the
hangings
of
one
of
the
archways
came
strange
discordant
sounds
barbaric
janglings
and
thumpings
varied
by
yowls
as
of
impassioned
cats
sylvia
drew
involuntarily
closer
to
horace
her
mother
woke
with
a
start
and
the
professor
looked
up
from
the
brass
bottle
with
returning
irritation
what
this
what
this
he
demanded
some
fresh
surprise
in
store
for
us
it
was
quite
as
much
of
a
surprise
for
horace
but
he
was
spared
the
humiliation
of
owning
it
by
the
entrance
of
some
dusky
musicians
swathed
in
white
and
carrying
various
strangely
fashioned
instruments
with
which
they
squatted
down
in
a
by
the
opposite
wall
and
began
to
twang
and
drub
and
squall
with
the
complacent
cacophony
of
an
eastern
orchestra
clearly
fakrash
was
determined
that
nothing
should
be
wanting
to
make
the
entertainment
a
complete
success
what
a
very
extraordinary
noise
said
futvoye
surely
they
mean
it
for
music
yes
they
do
said
horace
it
it
really
more
harmonious
than
it
sounds
you
have
to
get
accustomed
to
the
er
notation
when
you
do
it
rather
soothing
than
otherwise
i
dare
say
said
the
poor
lady
and
do
come
from
the
stores
too
no
said
horace
with
a
fine
assumption
of
candour
they
do
they
come
from
the
arab
encampment
at
earl
court
parties
and
attended
you
know
but
they
play
for
nothing
they
they
want
to
get
their
name
known
you
see
very
deserving
and
respectable
set
of
fellows
my
dear
horace
remarked
futvoye
if
they
expect
to
get
engagements
for
parties
and
so
on
they
really
ought
to
try
and
learn
a
tune
of
sort
i
understand
horace
whispered
sylvia
it
very
naughty
of
you
to
have
gone
to
all
this
trouble
and
expense
for
of
course
it
cost
you
a
lot
just
to
please
us
but
whatever
dad
may
say
i
love
you
all
the
better
for
doing
it
and
her
hand
stole
softly
into
his
and
he
felt
that
he
could
forgive
fakrash
everything
even
even
the
orchestra
but
there
was
something
unpleasantly
spectral
about
their
shadowy
forms
which
showed
in
grotesquely
baggy
and
bulgy
shapes
in
the
uncertain
light
some
of
them
wore
immense
and
curious
white
which
gave
them
the
appearance
of
poulticed
thumbs
and
they
all
went
on
scraping
and
twiddling
and
caterwauling
with
a
doleful
monotony
that
horace
felt
must
be
getting
on
his
guests
nerves
as
it
certainly
was
on
his
own
he
did
not
know
how
to
get
rid
of
them
but
he
sketched
a
kind
of
gesture
in
the
air
intended
to
intimate
that
while
their
efforts
had
afforded
the
keenest
pleasure
to
the
company
generally
they
were
unwilling
to
monopolise
them
any
longer
and
the
artists
were
at
liberty
to
retire
perhaps
there
is
no
art
more
liable
to
misconstruction
than
pantomime
certainly
ventimore
efforts
in
this
direction
were
misunderstood
for
the
music
became
wilder
louder
more
aggressively
and
abominably
out
of
tune
and
then
a
worse
thing
happened
for
the
curtains
separated
and
heralded
by
sharp
yelps
from
the
performers
a
female
figure
floated
into
the
hall
and
began
to
dance
with
a
slow
and
sinuous
grace
her
beauty
though
of
a
pronounced
oriental
type
was
unmistakable
even
in
the
subdued
light
which
fell
on
her
her
diaphanous
robe
indicated
a
faultless
form
her
dark
tresses
were
braided
with
sequins
she
had
the
long
lustrous
eyes
the
dusky
cheeks
artificially
whitened
and
the
fixed
scarlet
smile
of
the
eastern
of
all
time
and
she
paced
the
floor
with
her
tinkling
feet
writhing
and
undulating
like
some
beautiful
cobra
while
the
players
worked
themselves
up
to
yet
higher
and
higher
stages
of
frenzy
ventimore
as
he
sat
there
looking
helplessly
on
felt
a
return
of
his
resentment
against
the
jinnee
it
was
really
too
bad
of
him
he
ought
at
his
age
to
have
known
better
not
that
there
was
anything
objectionable
in
the
performance
itself
but
still
it
was
the
kind
of
entertainment
for
such
an
occasion
horace
wished
now
he
had
mentioned
to
fakrash
who
the
guests
were
whom
he
expected
and
then
perhaps
even
the
jinnee
would
have
exercised
more
tact
in
his
arrangements
and
does
this
girl
come
from
earl
court
inquired
futvoye
who
was
now
thoroughly
awake
oh
dear
no
said
horace
i
engaged
at
at
harrod
the
entertainment
bureau
they
told
me
there
she
was
rather
good
struck
out
a
line
of
her
own
do
you
know
but
perfectly
correct
she
she
only
does
this
to
support
an
invalid
aunt
these
statements
were
as
he
felt
even
in
making
them
not
only
gratuitous
but
utterly
unconvincing
but
he
had
arrived
at
that
condition
in
which
a
man
discovers
with
terror
the
unsuspected
amount
of
mendacity
latent
in
his
system
i
should
have
thought
there
were
other
ways
of
supporting
invalid
aunts
remarked
futvoye
what
is
this
young
lady
name
tinkler
said
horace
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
miss
clementine
tinkler
but
surely
she
is
a
foreigner
mademoiselle
i
ought
to
have
said
and
tinkla
with
an
you
know
i
believe
her
mother
was
of
arabian
extraction
but
i
really
know
explained
horace
conscious
that
sylvia
had
withdrawn
her
hand
from
his
and
was
regarding
him
with
covert
anxiety
i
really
put
a
stop
to
this
he
thought
you
getting
bored
by
all
this
darling
he
said
aloud
so
am
i
tell
them
to
go
and
he
rose
and
held
out
his
hand
as
a
sign
that
the
dance
should
cease
it
ceased
at
once
but
to
his
unspeakable
horror
the
dancer
crossed
the
floor
with
a
swift
jingling
rush
and
sank
in
a
gauzy
heap
at
his
feet
seizing
his
hand
in
both
hers
and
covering
it
with
kisses
while
she
murmured
speeches
in
some
tongue
unknown
to
him
is
this
a
usual
feature
in
miss
tinkla
entertainments
may
i
ask
said
futvoye
bristling
with
not
unnatural
indignation
i
really
do
know
said
the
unhappy
horace
i
ca
make
out
what
she
saying
if
i
understand
her
rightly
said
the
professor
she
is
addressing
you
as
the
of
her
eyes
and
the
vital
spirit
of
her
heart
oh
said
horace
she
quite
mistaken
you
know
it
it
the
emotional
artist
temperament
they
do
anything
by
it
my
my
dear
young
lady
he
added
you
danced
most
delightfully
and
sure
we
all
most
deeply
indebted
to
you
but
we
wo
detain
you
any
longer
professor
he
added
as
she
made
no
offer
to
rise
you
kindly
explain
to
them
in
arabic
that
i
should
be
obliged
by
their
going
at
once
the
professor
said
a
few
words
which
had
the
desired
effect
the
girl
gave
a
little
scream
and
scudded
through
the
archway
and
the
musicians
seized
their
instruments
and
scuttled
after
her
i
am
so
sorry
said
horace
whose
evening
seemed
to
him
to
have
been
chiefly
spent
in
apologies
it
not
at
all
the
kind
of
entertainment
one
would
expect
from
a
place
like
whiteley
by
no
means
agreed
the
professor
but
i
understood
you
to
say
miss
tinkla
was
recommended
to
you
by
harrod
very
likely
sir
said
horace
but
that
does
affect
the
case
i
should
expect
it
from
probably
they
do
know
how
shamelessly
that
young
person
conducts
herself
said
futvoye
and
i
think
it
only
right
that
they
should
be
told
i
shall
complain
of
course
said
horace
i
shall
put
it
very
strongly
a
protest
would
have
more
weight
coming
from
a
woman
said
futvoye
and
as
a
shareholder
in
the
company
i
shall
feel
bound
no
i
would
said
horace
in
fact
you
must
for
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
she
did
come
from
harrod
after
all
or
either
then
perhaps
you
will
be
good
enough
to
inform
us
where
she
come
from
i
would
if
i
knew
said
horace
but
i
do
what
cried
the
professor
sharply
do
you
mean
to
say
you
account
for
the
existence
of
a
who
in
my
presence
kisses
your
hand
and
addresses
you
by
endearing
epithets
oriental
metaphor
said
horace
she
was
a
little
overstrung
of
course
if
i
had
had
any
idea
she
would
make
such
a
scene
as
that
sylvia
he
broke
off
do
doubt
me
no
horace
said
sylvia
simply
i
sure
you
must
have
explanation
only
i
do
think
it
would
be
better
if
you
gave
it
if
i
you
the
truth
said
horace
slowly
you
would
none
of
you
believe
me
then
you
admit
put
in
the
professor
that
hitherto
you
have
been
telling
the
truth
not
as
invariably
as
i
could
have
wished
horace
confessed
so
i
suspected
then
unless
you
can
bring
yourself
to
be
perfectly
candid
you
can
hardly
wonder
at
our
asking
you
to
consider
your
engagement
as
broken
off
broken
off
echoed
horace
sylvia
you
wo
give
me
up
you
i
would
do
anything
unworthy
of
you
i
certain
that
you
ca
have
done
anything
which
would
make
me
love
you
one
bit
the
less
if
i
knew
it
so
why
not
be
quite
open
with
us
because
darling
said
horace
i
in
such
a
fix
that
it
would
only
make
matters
worse
in
that
case
said
the
professor
and
as
it
is
already
rather
late
perhaps
you
will
allow
one
of
your
numerous
retinue
to
call
a
horace
clapped
his
hands
but
no
one
answered
the
summons
and
he
could
not
find
any
of
the
slaves
in
the
antechamber
i
afraid
all
the
servants
have
left
he
explained
and
it
is
to
be
feared
he
would
have
added
that
they
were
all
obliged
to
return
to
the
contractor
by
eleven
only
he
caught
the
professor
eye
and
decided
that
he
had
better
refrain
if
you
will
wait
here
i
go
out
and
fetch
a
cab
he
added
there
is
no
occasion
to
trouble
you
said
the
professor
my
wife
and
daughter
have
already
got
their
things
on
and
we
will
walk
until
we
find
a
cab
now
ventimore
we
will
bid
you
and
for
after
what
has
happened
you
will
i
trust
have
the
good
taste
to
discontinue
your
visits
and
make
no
attempt
to
see
sylvia
again
upon
my
honour
protested
horace
i
have
done
nothing
to
warrant
you
in
shutting
your
doors
against
me
i
am
unable
to
agree
with
you
i
have
never
thoroughly
approved
of
your
engagement
because
as
i
told
you
at
the
time
i
suspected
you
of
recklessness
in
money
matters
even
in
accepting
your
invitation
i
warned
you
as
you
may
remember
not
to
make
the
occasion
an
excuse
for
foolish
extravagance
i
come
here
and
find
you
in
apartments
furnished
and
decorated
as
you
informed
us
by
yourself
and
on
a
scale
which
would
be
prodigal
in
a
millionaire
you
have
a
suite
of
retainers
which
except
for
their
nationality
and
imperfect
discipline
a
prince
might
envy
you
provide
a
banquet
of
hem
delicacies
which
must
have
cost
you
infinite
trouble
and
unlimited
expense
this
after
i
had
expressly
stipulated
for
a
quiet
family
dinner
not
content
with
that
you
procure
for
our
diversion
arab
music
and
dancing
of
a
of
a
highly
recondite
character
i
should
be
unworthy
of
the
name
of
father
sir
if
i
were
to
entrust
my
only
daughter
happiness
to
a
young
man
with
so
little
common
sense
so
little
and
she
will
understand
my
motives
and
obey
my
wishes
you
right
professor
according
to
your
lights
admitted
horace
and
yet
confound
it
all
you
utterly
wrong
too
oh
horace
cried
sylvia
if
you
had
only
listened
to
dad
and
not
gone
to
all
this
foolish
foolish
expense
we
might
have
been
so
happy
but
i
have
gone
to
no
expense
all
this
has
cost
me
a
penny
ah
there
some
mystery
horace
if
you
love
me
you
will
explain
here
now
before
it
too
late
my
darling
groaned
horace
i
would
like
a
shot
if
i
thought
it
would
be
of
the
least
use
hitherto
said
the
professor
you
can
not
be
said
to
have
been
happy
in
your
explanations
and
i
should
advise
you
not
to
venture
on
any
more
once
more
i
only
wish
it
were
possible
without
needless
irony
to
make
the
customary
acknowledgments
for
a
pleasant
evening
futvoye
had
already
hurried
her
daughter
away
and
though
she
had
left
her
husband
to
express
his
sentiments
unaided
she
made
it
sufficiently
clear
that
she
entirely
agreed
with
them
horace
stood
in
the
outer
hall
by
the
fountain
in
which
his
drowned
chrysanthemums
were
still
floating
and
gazed
in
stupefied
despair
after
his
guests
as
they
went
down
the
path
to
the
gate
he
knew
only
too
well
that
they
would
never
cross
his
threshold
nor
he
theirs
again
suddenly
he
came
to
himself
with
a
start
i
try
it
he
cried
i
ca
and
wo
stand
this
and
he
rushed
after
them
bareheaded
professor
he
said
breathlessly
as
he
caught
him
up
one
moment
on
second
thoughts
i
tell
you
my
secret
if
you
will
promise
me
a
patient
hearing
the
pavement
is
hardly
the
place
for
confidences
replied
the
professor
and
if
it
were
your
costume
is
calculated
to
attract
more
remark
than
is
desirable
my
wife
and
daughter
have
gone
on
if
you
will
permit
me
i
will
overtake
them
i
shall
be
at
home
morning
should
you
wish
to
see
me
no
urged
horace
i
ca
sleep
in
that
infernal
place
with
this
on
my
mind
put
futvoye
and
sylvia
into
a
cab
professor
and
come
back
it
not
late
and
i
wo
keep
you
long
but
for
heaven
sake
let
me
tell
you
my
story
at
once
probably
the
professor
was
not
without
some
curiosity
on
the
subject
at
all
events
he
yielded
very
well
he
said
go
into
the
house
and
i
will
rejoin
you
presently
only
remember
he
added
that
i
shall
accept
no
statement
without
the
fullest
proof
otherwise
you
will
merely
be
wasting
your
time
and
mine
proof
thought
horace
gloomily
as
he
returned
to
his
arabian
halls
the
only
decent
proof
i
could
produce
would
be
old
fakrash
and
not
likely
to
turn
up
again
especially
now
i
want
him
a
little
later
the
professor
returned
having
found
a
cab
and
despatched
his
home
now
young
man
he
said
as
he
unwound
his
wrapper
and
seated
himself
on
the
divan
by
horace
side
i
can
give
you
just
ten
minutes
to
tell
your
story
in
so
let
me
beg
you
to
make
it
as
brief
and
as
comprehensible
as
you
can
it
was
not
exactly
an
encouraging
invitation
in
the
circumstances
but
horace
took
his
courage
in
both
hands
and
told
him
everything
just
as
it
had
happened
and
that
your
story
said
the
professor
after
listening
to
the
narrative
with
the
utmost
attention
when
horace
came
to
the
end
that
my
story
sir
said
horace
and
i
hope
it
has
altered
your
opinion
of
me
it
has
replied
the
professor
in
an
altered
tone
it
has
indeed
yours
is
a
sad
case
a
very
sad
case
it
rather
awkward
is
it
but
i
do
mind
so
long
as
you
understand
and
you
tell
sylvia
as
much
as
you
think
proper
yes
yes
i
must
tell
sylvia
and
i
may
go
on
seeing
her
as
usual
well
will
you
be
guided
by
my
advice
the
advice
of
one
who
has
lived
more
than
double
your
years
certainly
said
horace
then
if
i
were
you
i
should
go
away
at
once
for
a
complete
change
of
air
and
scene
that
impossible
sir
you
forget
my
work
never
mind
your
work
my
boy
leave
it
for
a
while
try
a
go
round
the
world
get
quite
away
from
these
associations
but
i
might
come
across
the
jinnee
again
objected
horace
travelling
as
i
told
you
yes
yes
to
be
sure
still
i
should
go
away
consult
any
doctor
and
he
tell
you
the
same
thing
consult
any
good
god
cried
horace
i
see
what
it
is
you
think
i
mad
no
no
my
dear
boy
said
the
professor
soothingly
not
mad
nothing
of
the
sort
perhaps
your
mental
equilibrium
is
just
a
trifle
quite
intelligible
you
see
the
sudden
turn
in
your
professional
prospects
coupled
with
your
engagement
to
sylvia
i
known
stronger
minds
than
yours
thrown
off
their
balance
temporarily
of
course
quite
temporarily
by
less
than
that
you
believe
i
am
suffering
from
delusions
i
do
say
that
i
think
you
may
see
ordinary
things
in
a
distorted
light
anyhow
you
do
believe
there
really
was
a
jinnee
inside
that
bottle
remember
you
yourself
assured
me
at
the
time
you
opened
it
that
you
found
nothing
whatever
inside
it
is
it
more
credible
that
you
were
right
then
than
that
you
should
be
right
now
well
said
horace
you
saw
all
those
black
slaves
you
ate
or
tried
to
eat
that
unutterably
beastly
banquet
you
heard
that
music
and
then
there
was
the
and
this
hall
we
in
this
robe
i
got
on
are
delusions
because
if
they
are
i
afraid
you
will
have
to
admit
that
mad
too
ingeniously
put
said
the
professor
i
fear
it
is
unwise
to
argue
with
you
still
i
will
venture
to
assert
that
a
strong
imagination
like
yours
and
saturated
with
oriental
ideas
to
which
i
fear
i
may
have
contributed
is
not
incapable
of
unconsciously
assisting
in
its
own
deception
in
other
words
i
think
that
you
may
have
provided
all
this
yourself
from
various
quarters
without
any
clear
recollection
of
the
fact
that
very
scientific
and
satisfactory
as
far
as
it
goes
my
dear
professor
said
horace
but
there
one
piece
of
evidence
which
may
upset
your
theory
and
that
this
brass
bottle
if
your
reasoning
powers
were
in
their
normal
condition
said
the
professor
compassionately
you
would
see
that
the
mere
production
of
an
empty
bottle
can
be
no
proof
of
what
it
contained
or
for
that
matter
that
it
ever
contained
anything
at
all
oh
i
see
said
horace
but
bottle
has
a
stopper
with
what
you
yourself
admit
to
be
an
inscription
of
some
sort
suppose
that
inscription
confirms
my
story
what
then
all
i
ask
you
to
do
is
to
make
it
out
for
yourself
before
you
decide
that
i
either
a
liar
or
a
lunatic
i
warn
you
said
the
professor
that
if
you
are
trusting
to
my
being
unable
to
decipher
the
inscription
you
are
deceiving
yourself
you
represent
that
this
bottle
belongs
to
the
period
of
solomon
that
is
about
a
thousand
years
probably
you
are
not
aware
that
the
earliest
specimens
of
oriental
in
existence
are
not
older
than
the
tenth
century
of
our
era
but
granting
that
it
is
as
old
as
you
allege
i
shall
certainly
be
able
to
read
any
inscription
there
may
be
on
it
i
have
made
out
clay
tablets
in
cuneiform
which
were
certainly
written
a
thousand
years
before
solomon
time
so
much
the
better
said
horace
i
as
certain
as
i
can
be
that
whatever
is
written
on
that
lid
whether
it
phoenician
or
cuneiform
or
anything
else
must
have
some
reference
to
a
jinnee
confined
in
the
bottle
or
at
least
bear
the
seal
of
solomon
but
there
the
thing
is
examine
it
for
yourself
not
now
said
the
professor
it
too
late
and
the
light
here
is
not
strong
enough
but
i
tell
you
what
i
will
do
i
take
this
stopper
thing
home
with
me
and
examine
it
carefully
on
one
condition
you
have
only
to
name
it
said
horace
my
condition
is
that
if
i
and
one
or
two
other
orientalists
to
whom
i
may
submit
it
come
to
the
conclusion
that
there
is
no
real
inscription
at
all
or
if
any
that
a
date
and
meaning
must
be
assigned
to
it
totally
inconsistent
with
your
story
you
will
accept
our
finding
and
acknowledge
that
you
have
been
under
a
delusion
and
dismiss
the
whole
affair
from
your
mind
oh
i
do
mind
agreeing
to
said
horace
particularly
as
it
my
only
chance
very
well
then
said
the
professor
as
he
removed
the
metal
cap
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
you
may
depend
upon
hearing
from
me
in
a
day
or
two
meantime
my
boy
he
continued
almost
affectionately
why
not
try
a
short
bicycle
tour
somewhere
hey
you
a
cyclist
i
know
anything
but
allow
yourself
to
dwell
on
oriental
subjects
it
not
so
easy
to
avoid
dwelling
on
them
as
you
think
said
horace
with
rather
a
dreary
laugh
and
i
fancy
professor
that
whether
you
like
it
or
not
you
have
to
believe
in
that
jinnee
of
mine
sooner
or
later
i
can
scarcely
conceive
replied
the
professor
who
was
by
this
time
at
the
outer
door
any
degree
of
evidence
which
could
succeed
in
convincing
me
that
your
brass
bottle
had
ever
contained
an
arabian
jinnee
however
i
shall
endeavour
to
preserve
an
open
mind
on
the
subject
good
evening
to
you
as
soon
as
he
was
alone
horace
paced
up
and
down
his
deserted
halls
in
a
state
of
simmering
rage
as
he
thought
how
eagerly
he
had
looked
forward
to
his
little
how
intimate
and
delightful
it
might
have
been
and
what
a
monstrous
and
prolonged
nightmare
it
had
actually
proved
and
at
the
end
of
it
there
he
was
in
a
fantastic
impossible
dwelling
deserted
by
every
one
his
chances
of
setting
himself
right
with
sylvia
hanging
on
the
slenderest
thread
unknown
difficulties
and
complications
threatening
him
from
every
side
he
owed
all
this
to
fakrash
yes
that
incorrigibly
grateful
jinnee
with
his
antiquated
notions
and
his
professions
had
contrived
to
ruin
him
more
disastrously
than
if
he
had
been
his
bitterest
foe
ah
if
he
could
be
face
to
face
with
him
once
more
if
only
for
five
minutes
he
would
be
restrained
by
no
false
delicacy
he
would
tell
him
fairly
and
plainly
what
a
meddling
blundering
old
fool
he
was
but
fakrash
had
taken
his
flight
for
ever
there
were
no
means
of
calling
him
back
nothing
to
be
done
now
but
go
to
bed
and
sleep
if
he
could
exasperated
by
the
sense
of
his
utter
helplessness
ventimore
went
to
the
arch
which
led
to
his
and
drew
the
curtain
back
with
a
furious
pull
and
just
within
the
archway
standing
erect
with
folded
arms
and
the
smile
of
fatuous
benignity
which
ventimore
was
beginning
to
know
and
dread
was
the
form
of
the
jinnee
chapter
x
no
place
like
home
may
thy
head
long
survive
said
fakrash
by
way
of
salutation
as
he
stepped
through
the
archway
you
very
good
said
horace
whose
anger
had
almost
evaporated
in
the
relief
of
the
jinnee
unexpected
return
but
i
do
think
any
head
can
survive
this
sort
of
thing
long
art
thou
content
with
this
dwelling
i
have
provided
for
thee
inquired
the
jinnee
glancing
around
the
stately
hall
with
perceptible
complacency
it
would
have
been
positively
brutal
to
say
how
very
far
from
contented
he
felt
so
horace
could
only
mumble
that
he
had
never
been
lodged
like
that
before
in
all
his
life
it
is
far
below
thy
deserts
fakrash
observed
graciously
and
were
thy
friends
amazed
at
the
manner
of
their
entertainment
they
were
said
horace
a
sure
method
of
preserving
friends
is
to
feast
them
with
liberality
remarked
the
jinnee
this
was
rather
more
than
horace
temper
could
stand
you
were
kind
enough
to
provide
my
friends
with
such
a
feast
he
said
that
never
come
again
how
so
were
not
the
meats
choice
and
abounding
in
fatness
was
not
the
wine
sweet
and
the
sherbet
like
unto
perfumed
snow
oh
everything
was
er
as
nice
as
possible
said
horace
have
been
better
yet
thou
sayest
that
thy
friends
will
return
no
more
for
what
reason
well
you
see
explained
horace
reluctantly
there
such
a
thing
as
doing
people
well
i
mean
it
is
everybody
that
appreciates
arabian
cooking
but
they
might
have
stood
that
it
was
the
that
did
for
me
i
commanded
that
a
houri
lovelier
than
the
full
moon
and
graceful
as
a
young
gazelle
should
appear
for
the
delight
of
thy
guests
she
came
said
horace
gloomily
acquaint
me
with
that
which
hath
occurred
for
i
perceive
plainly
that
something
hath
fallen
out
contrary
to
thy
desires
well
said
horace
if
it
had
been
a
bachelor
party
there
would
have
been
no
harm
in
the
houri
but
as
it
happened
two
of
my
guests
were
ladies
and
they
well
they
not
unnaturally
put
a
wrong
construction
on
it
all
verily
exclaimed
the
jinnee
thy
words
are
totally
incomprehensible
to
me
i
do
know
what
the
custom
may
be
in
arabia
said
horace
but
with
us
it
is
not
usual
for
a
man
to
engage
a
houri
to
dance
after
dinner
to
amuse
the
lady
he
is
proposing
to
marry
it
the
kind
of
attention
she
be
most
unlikely
to
appreciate
then
was
one
of
thy
guests
the
damsel
whom
thou
art
seeking
to
marry
she
was
said
horace
and
the
other
two
were
her
father
and
mother
from
which
you
may
imagine
that
it
was
not
altogether
agreeable
for
me
when
your
gazelle
threw
herself
at
my
feet
and
hugged
my
knees
and
declared
that
i
was
the
light
of
her
eyes
of
course
it
all
meant
nothing
it
probably
the
conventional
behaviour
for
a
gazelle
and
not
reflecting
upon
her
in
the
least
but
in
the
circumstances
it
compromising
i
thought
said
fakrash
that
thou
assuredst
me
that
thou
wast
not
contracted
to
any
damsel
i
think
i
only
said
that
there
was
no
one
whom
i
would
trouble
you
to
procure
as
a
wife
for
me
replied
horace
i
certainly
was
engaged
though
after
this
evening
my
engagement
is
at
an
end
unless
that
reminds
me
do
you
happen
to
know
whether
there
really
an
inscription
on
the
seal
of
your
bottle
and
what
it
said
i
know
naught
of
any
inscription
said
the
jinnee
bring
me
the
seal
that
i
may
see
it
i
have
got
it
by
me
at
this
moment
said
horace
i
lent
it
to
my
friend
the
father
of
this
young
lady
i
told
you
of
you
see
fakrash
you
got
me
into
i
mean
i
was
in
such
a
hole
over
this
affair
that
i
was
obliged
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
to
him
and
he
believe
it
so
it
struck
me
that
there
might
be
an
inscription
of
some
sort
on
the
seal
saying
who
you
were
and
why
solomon
had
you
confined
in
the
bottle
then
the
professor
would
be
obliged
to
admit
that
something
in
my
story
truly
i
wonder
at
thee
and
at
the
smallness
of
thy
penetration
the
jinnee
commented
for
if
there
were
indeed
any
writing
upon
this
seal
it
is
not
possible
that
one
of
thy
race
should
be
able
to
decipher
it
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
said
horace
professor
futvoye
is
an
oriental
scholar
he
can
make
out
any
inscription
no
matter
how
many
thousands
of
years
old
it
may
be
if
anything
there
he
decipher
it
the
question
is
whether
anything
there
the
effect
of
this
speech
on
fakrash
was
as
unexpected
as
it
was
inexplicable
the
jinnee
features
usually
so
mild
began
to
work
convulsively
until
they
became
terrible
to
look
at
and
suddenly
with
a
fierce
howl
he
shot
up
to
nearly
double
his
ordinary
stature
o
thou
of
little
sense
and
breeding
he
cried
in
a
loud
voice
how
camest
thou
to
deliver
the
bottle
in
which
i
was
confined
into
the
hands
of
this
learned
man
ventimore
startled
as
he
was
did
not
lose
his
my
dear
sir
he
said
i
did
not
suppose
you
could
have
any
further
use
for
it
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
did
give
professor
futvoye
the
bottle
which
is
over
there
in
the
corner
but
merely
the
stopper
i
wish
you
would
tower
over
me
like
that
it
gives
me
a
crick
in
the
neck
to
talk
to
you
why
on
earth
should
you
make
such
a
fuss
about
my
lending
the
seal
what
possible
difference
can
it
make
to
you
even
if
it
does
confirm
my
story
and
it
of
immense
importance
to
that
the
professor
should
believe
i
told
the
truth
i
spoke
in
haste
said
the
jinnee
slowly
resuming
his
normal
size
and
looking
slightly
ashamed
of
his
recent
outburst
as
well
as
uncommonly
foolish
the
bottle
truly
is
of
no
value
and
as
for
the
stopper
since
it
is
but
lent
it
is
no
great
matter
if
there
be
any
legend
upon
the
seal
perchance
this
learned
man
of
whom
thou
speakest
will
by
this
time
have
deciphered
it
no
said
horace
he
wo
tackle
it
till
and
it
as
likely
as
not
that
when
he
does
he
wo
find
any
reference
to
and
i
shall
be
up
a
taller
tree
than
ever
art
thou
so
desirous
that
he
should
receive
proof
that
thy
story
is
true
why
of
course
i
am
have
i
been
saying
so
all
this
time
who
can
satisfy
him
so
surely
as
i
you
cried
horace
do
you
mean
to
say
you
really
would
fakrash
you
an
old
brick
that
would
be
the
very
thing
there
is
naught
said
the
jinnee
smiling
indulgently
that
i
would
not
do
to
promote
thy
welfare
for
thou
hast
rendered
me
inestimable
service
acquaint
me
therefore
with
the
abode
of
this
sage
and
i
will
present
myself
before
him
and
if
haply
he
should
find
no
inscription
upon
the
seal
or
its
purport
should
be
hidden
from
him
then
will
i
convince
him
that
thou
hast
spoken
the
truth
and
no
lie
horace
very
willingly
gave
him
the
professor
address
only
drop
in
on
him
you
know
he
thought
it
prudent
to
add
or
you
might
startle
him
call
any
time
after
breakfast
and
you
find
him
in
said
fakrash
i
return
to
pursue
my
search
after
suleyman
on
whom
be
peace
for
not
yet
have
i
found
him
if
you
try
to
do
so
many
things
at
once
said
horace
i
see
how
you
can
expect
much
result
at
nineveh
they
knew
him
not
for
where
i
left
a
city
i
found
but
a
heap
of
ruins
tenanted
by
owls
and
bats
say
the
lion
and
the
lizard
keep
the
murmured
horace
half
to
himself
i
was
afraid
you
might
be
disappointed
with
nineveh
myself
why
not
run
over
to
sheba
you
might
hear
of
him
there
seba
of
the
country
of
bilkees
the
queen
beloved
of
suleyman
said
the
jinnee
it
is
an
excellent
suggestion
and
i
will
follow
it
without
delay
but
you
wo
forget
to
look
in
on
professor
futvoye
will
you
assuredly
i
will
not
and
now
ere
i
depart
tell
me
if
there
be
any
other
service
i
may
render
thee
horace
hesitated
there
just
one
he
said
only
i
afraid
you
be
offended
if
i
mention
it
on
the
head
and
the
eye
be
thy
commands
said
the
jinnee
for
whatsoever
thou
desirest
shall
be
accomplished
provided
that
it
lie
within
my
power
to
perform
it
well
said
horace
if
you
sure
you
do
mind
i
tell
you
you
transformed
this
house
into
a
wonderful
place
more
like
the
alhambra
i
do
mean
the
one
in
leicester
square
than
a
london
but
then
i
am
only
a
lodger
here
and
the
people
the
house
belongs
to
excellent
people
in
their
way
would
very
much
rather
have
the
house
as
it
was
they
have
a
sort
of
idea
that
they
wo
be
able
to
let
these
rooms
as
easily
as
the
others
base
and
sordid
dogs
said
the
jinnee
with
contempt
possibly
said
horace
it
of
them
but
that
the
way
they
look
at
it
they
actually
left
rather
than
stay
here
and
house
not
mine
if
they
abandon
this
dwelling
thou
wilt
remain
in
the
more
secure
possession
oh
i
though
they
go
to
law
and
have
me
turned
out
and
i
shall
have
to
pay
ruinous
damages
into
the
bargain
so
you
see
what
you
intended
as
a
kindness
will
only
bring
me
bad
luck
come
without
more
words
to
the
statement
of
thy
request
said
fakrash
for
i
am
in
haste
all
i
want
you
to
do
replied
horace
in
some
anxiety
as
to
what
the
effect
of
his
request
would
be
is
to
put
everything
here
back
to
what
it
was
before
it
wo
take
you
a
minute
of
a
truth
exclaimed
fakrash
to
bestow
a
favour
upon
thee
is
but
a
thankless
undertaking
for
not
once
but
twice
hast
thou
rejected
my
benefits
and
now
behold
i
am
at
a
loss
to
devise
means
to
gratify
thee
i
know
i
abused
your
good
nature
said
horace
but
if
you
only
do
this
and
then
convince
the
professor
that
my
story
is
true
i
shall
be
more
than
satisfied
i
never
ask
another
favour
of
you
my
benevolence
towards
thee
hath
no
bounds
as
thou
shalt
see
and
i
can
deny
thee
nothing
for
truly
thou
art
a
worthy
and
temperate
young
man
farewell
then
and
be
it
according
to
thy
desire
he
raised
his
arms
above
his
head
and
shot
up
like
a
rocket
towards
the
lofty
dome
which
split
asunder
to
let
him
pass
horace
as
he
gazed
after
him
had
a
momentary
glimpse
of
deep
blue
sky
with
a
star
or
two
that
seemed
to
be
hurrying
through
the
transparent
opal
scud
before
the
roof
closed
in
once
more
then
came
a
low
rumbling
sound
with
a
shock
like
a
mild
earthquake
the
slender
pillars
swayed
under
their
horseshoe
arches
the
big
went
out
the
walls
narrowed
and
the
floor
heaved
and
rose
till
ventimore
found
himself
up
in
his
own
familiar
once
more
in
the
dark
outside
he
could
see
the
great
square
still
shrouded
in
grey
haze
the
street
lamps
flickering
in
the
wind
a
belated
reveller
was
beguiling
his
homeward
way
by
rattling
his
stick
against
the
railings
as
he
passed
inside
the
room
everything
was
exactly
as
before
and
horace
found
it
difficult
to
believe
that
a
few
minutes
earlier
he
had
been
standing
on
that
same
site
but
twenty
feet
or
so
below
his
present
level
in
a
spacious
hall
with
a
domed
ceiling
and
gaudy
pillared
arches
but
he
was
very
far
from
regretting
his
splendour
he
burnt
with
shame
and
resentment
whenever
he
thought
of
that
nightmare
banquet
which
was
so
unlike
the
quiet
unpretentious
little
dinner
he
had
looked
forward
to
however
it
was
over
now
and
it
was
useless
to
worry
himself
about
what
could
not
be
helped
besides
fortunately
there
was
no
great
harm
done
the
jinnee
had
been
brought
to
see
his
mistake
and
to
do
him
justice
had
shown
himself
willing
enough
to
put
it
right
he
had
promised
to
go
and
see
the
professor
next
day
and
the
result
of
the
interview
could
not
fail
to
be
satisfactory
and
after
this
ventimore
thought
fakrash
would
have
the
sense
and
good
feeling
not
to
interfere
in
his
affairs
again
meanwhile
he
could
sleep
now
with
a
mind
free
from
his
worst
anxieties
and
he
went
to
his
room
in
a
spirit
of
intense
thankfulness
that
he
had
a
christian
bed
to
sleep
in
he
took
off
his
gorgeous
robes
the
only
things
that
remained
to
prove
to
him
that
the
events
of
that
evening
had
been
no
delusion
and
locked
them
in
his
wardrobe
with
a
sense
of
relief
that
he
would
never
be
required
to
wear
them
again
and
his
last
conscious
thought
before
he
fell
asleep
was
the
comforting
reflection
that
if
there
were
any
barrier
between
sylvia
and
himself
it
would
be
removed
in
the
course
of
a
very
few
more
hours
chapter
xi
a
fool
paradise
ventimore
found
next
morning
that
his
bath
and
had
been
brought
up
from
which
he
inferred
quite
correctly
that
his
landlady
must
have
returned
secretly
he
was
by
no
means
looking
forward
to
his
next
interview
with
her
but
she
appeared
with
his
bacon
and
coffee
in
a
spirit
so
evidently
chastened
that
he
saw
that
he
would
have
no
difficulty
so
far
as
she
was
concerned
i
sure
ventimore
sir
she
began
apologetically
i
do
know
what
you
must
have
thought
of
me
and
rapkin
last
night
leaving
the
house
like
we
did
it
was
extremely
inconvenient
said
horace
and
not
at
all
what
i
should
have
expected
from
you
but
possibly
you
had
some
reason
for
it
why
sir
said
rapkin
running
her
hand
nervously
along
the
back
of
a
chair
the
fact
is
something
come
over
me
and
come
over
rapkin
as
we
could
stop
here
another
minute
not
if
it
was
ever
so
ah
said
horace
raising
his
eyebrows
restlessness
eh
rapkin
awkward
that
it
should
come
on
just
then
though
was
it
it
was
the
look
of
the
place
somehow
said
rapkin
if
believe
me
sir
it
was
all
changed
like
nothing
in
it
the
same
from
top
to
bottom
really
said
horace
i
do
notice
any
difference
myself
no
more
do
i
sir
not
by
daylight
but
last
night
it
was
all
domes
and
harches
and
marble
fountings
let
into
the
floor
with
parties
moving
about
downstairs
all
silent
and
as
black
as
your
hat
which
rapkin
saw
them
as
well
as
what
i
did
from
the
state
your
husband
was
in
last
night
said
horace
i
should
say
he
was
capable
of
seeing
anything
and
double
of
most
things
i
wo
deny
sir
that
rapkin
may
have
been
quite
hisself
as
a
very
little
upsets
him
after
he
spent
an
afternoon
studying
the
papers
and
at
the
libery
but
i
see
the
niggers
too
ventimore
and
no
one
can
say
ever
take
more
than
is
good
for
me
i
do
suggest
that
for
a
moment
rapkin
said
horace
only
if
the
house
was
as
you
describe
last
night
how
do
you
account
for
its
being
all
right
this
morning
rapkin
in
her
embarrassment
was
reduced
to
folding
her
apron
into
small
pleats
it
not
for
me
to
say
sir
she
replied
but
if
i
was
to
give
my
opinion
it
would
be
as
them
parties
as
called
on
camels
the
other
day
was
at
the
bottom
of
it
i
should
wonder
if
you
were
right
rapkin
said
horace
blandly
you
see
you
had
been
exerting
yourself
over
the
cooking
and
no
doubt
were
in
an
state
and
as
you
say
those
camels
had
taken
hold
of
your
imagination
until
you
were
ready
to
see
anything
that
rapkin
saw
and
was
ready
to
see
anything
did
it
not
at
all
uncommon
scientific
people
i
believe
call
it
hallucination
law
sir
said
the
good
woman
considerably
impressed
by
this
diagnosis
you
do
mean
to
say
i
had
i
was
always
fanciful
from
a
girl
and
could
see
things
in
as
nobody
else
could
but
i
never
was
took
like
that
before
and
to
think
of
me
leaving
my
dinner
half
cooked
and
you
expecting
your
young
lady
and
her
pa
and
ma
well
now
i
sorry
whatever
did
you
do
sir
we
managed
to
get
food
of
sorts
from
somewhere
said
horace
but
it
was
most
uncomfortable
for
me
and
i
trust
rapkin
i
sincerely
trust
that
it
will
not
occur
again
that
i
answer
for
it
sha
sir
and
you
wo
take
no
notice
to
rapkin
sir
will
you
though
it
was
his
seein
the
niggers
and
that
as
put
it
into
my
but
i
spoke
to
him
pretty
severe
already
and
he
truly
sorry
and
ashamed
for
forgetting
hisself
as
he
did
very
well
rapkin
said
horace
we
will
understand
that
last
night
hem
rather
painful
experience
is
not
to
be
alluded
to
again
on
either
side
he
felt
sincerely
thankful
to
have
got
out
of
it
so
easily
for
it
was
impossible
to
say
what
gossip
might
not
have
been
set
on
foot
if
the
rapkins
had
not
been
brought
to
see
the
advisability
of
reticence
on
the
subject
there
one
more
thing
sir
i
wished
for
to
speak
to
you
about
said
rapkin
that
great
brass
vawse
as
you
bought
at
an
oction
some
time
back
i
dunno
if
you
remember
it
i
remember
it
said
horace
well
what
about
it
why
sir
i
found
it
in
the
this
morning
and
i
thought
ask
if
that
was
where
you
wished
it
kep
in
future
for
though
no
amount
o
polish
could
make
it
what
i
call
a
tasty
thing
it
neither
horniment
nor
yet
useful
where
it
is
at
present
oh
said
horace
rather
relieved
for
he
had
an
dread
from
her
opening
words
that
the
bottle
might
have
been
misbehaving
itself
in
some
way
put
it
wherever
you
please
rapkin
do
whatever
you
like
with
it
so
long
as
i
do
see
the
thing
again
very
good
sir
i
thought
i
ask
the
question
said
rapkin
as
she
closed
the
door
upon
herself
altogether
horace
walked
to
great
cloister
street
that
morning
in
a
fairly
cheerful
mood
and
amiably
disposed
even
towards
the
jinnee
with
all
his
many
faults
he
was
a
thoroughly
old
devil
very
superior
in
every
way
to
the
one
the
arabian
nights
fisherman
found
in
bottle
jinn
out
of
a
hundred
thought
horace
would
have
turned
nasty
on
finding
benefit
after
benefit
with
thanks
but
one
good
point
in
fakrash
is
that
he
take
a
hint
in
good
part
and
as
soon
as
he
can
be
made
to
see
where
he
wrong
he
always
ready
to
set
things
right
and
he
thoroughly
understands
now
that
these
oriental
dodges
of
his
wo
do
nowadays
and
that
when
people
see
a
penniless
man
suddenly
wallowing
in
riches
they
naturally
want
to
know
how
he
came
by
them
i
do
suppose
he
will
trouble
me
much
in
future
if
he
should
look
in
now
and
then
i
must
put
up
with
it
perhaps
if
i
suggested
it
he
would
mind
coming
in
some
form
that
would
look
less
outlandish
if
he
would
get
himself
up
as
a
banker
or
a
bishop
the
bishop
of
bagdad
say
i
should
care
how
often
he
called
only
i
ca
have
him
coming
down
the
chimney
in
either
capacity
but
he
see
that
himself
and
he
done
me
one
real
service
i
must
let
myself
forget
that
he
sent
me
old
wackerbath
by
the
way
i
wonder
if
he
seen
my
designs
yet
and
what
he
thinks
of
them
he
was
at
his
table
engaged
in
jotting
down
some
rough
ideas
for
the
decoration
of
the
in
the
projected
house
when
beevor
came
in
i
got
nothing
doing
just
now
he
said
so
i
thought
i
come
in
and
have
a
squint
at
those
plans
of
yours
if
they
forward
enough
to
be
seen
yet
ventimore
had
to
explain
that
even
the
imperfect
method
of
examination
proposed
was
not
possible
as
he
had
despatched
the
drawings
to
his
client
the
night
before
phew
said
beevor
that
sharp
work
is
it
i
do
know
i
been
sticking
hard
at
it
for
over
a
fortnight
well
you
might
have
given
me
a
chance
of
seeing
what
you
made
of
it
i
let
you
see
all
work
to
tell
you
the
honest
truth
old
fellow
i
was
at
all
sure
like
it
and
i
was
afraid
you
put
me
out
of
conceit
with
what
done
and
wackerbath
was
in
a
frantic
hurry
to
have
the
plans
so
there
it
was
and
do
you
think
he
be
satisfied
with
them
he
ought
to
be
i
do
like
to
be
but
i
believe
i
really
do
believe
that
i
given
him
rather
more
than
he
expected
it
going
to
be
a
devilish
good
house
though
i
say
it
myself
something
and
fantastic
eh
well
he
may
care
about
it
you
know
when
you
had
my
experience
you
realise
that
a
client
is
a
rum
bird
to
satisfy
i
shall
satisfy
old
bird
said
horace
gaily
he
have
a
cage
he
can
hop
about
in
to
his
heart
content
you
a
clever
chap
enough
said
beevor
but
to
carry
a
big
job
like
this
through
you
want
one
thing
and
that
ballast
not
while
you
heave
yours
at
my
head
come
old
fellow
you
really
riled
because
i
sent
off
those
plans
without
showing
them
to
you
i
shall
soon
have
them
back
and
then
you
can
pitch
into
as
much
as
you
please
seriously
though
i
shall
want
all
the
help
you
can
spare
when
i
come
to
the
completed
designs
said
beevor
you
got
along
very
well
alone
so
far
at
least
by
your
own
account
so
i
dare
say
you
be
able
to
manage
without
me
to
the
end
only
you
know
he
added
as
he
left
the
room
you
won
your
spurs
yet
a
fellow
is
necessarily
a
gilbert
scott
or
a
norman
shaw
or
a
waterhouse
just
because
he
happens
to
get
a
pound
job
the
first
go
off
poor
old
beevor
thought
horace
repentantly
i
put
his
back
up
i
might
just
as
well
have
shown
him
the
plans
after
all
it
have
hurt
me
and
it
would
have
pleased
never
mind
i
make
my
peace
with
him
after
lunch
i
ask
him
to
give
me
his
idea
for
a
no
hang
it
all
even
friendship
has
its
limits
he
returned
from
lunch
to
hear
what
sounded
like
an
altercation
of
some
sort
in
his
office
in
which
as
he
neared
his
door
beevor
voice
was
distinctly
audible
my
dear
sir
he
was
saying
i
have
already
told
you
that
it
is
no
affair
of
mine
but
i
ask
you
sir
as
a
brother
architect
said
another
voice
whether
you
consider
it
professional
or
reasonable
as
a
brother
architect
replied
beevor
as
ventimore
opened
the
door
i
would
rather
be
excused
from
giving
an
opinion
ah
here
is
ventimore
himself
horace
entered
to
find
himself
confronted
by
wackerbath
whose
face
was
purple
and
whose
white
whiskers
were
bristling
with
rage
so
sir
he
began
so
sir
and
choked
ignominiously
there
appears
to
have
been
some
misunderstanding
my
dear
ventimore
explained
beevor
with
a
studious
correctness
which
was
only
a
shade
less
offensive
than
open
triumph
i
think
i
better
leave
you
and
this
gentleman
to
talk
it
over
quietly
quietly
exclaimed
wackerbath
with
an
apoplectic
snort
i
no
idea
what
you
are
so
excited
about
sir
said
horace
perhaps
you
will
explain
explain
wackerbath
gasped
why
no
if
i
speak
just
now
i
shall
be
ill
tell
him
he
added
waving
a
plump
hand
in
direction
i
not
in
possession
of
all
the
facts
said
beevor
smoothly
but
so
far
as
i
can
gather
this
gentleman
thinks
that
considering
the
importance
of
the
work
he
intrusted
to
your
hands
you
have
given
less
time
to
it
than
he
might
have
expected
as
i
have
told
him
that
is
a
matter
which
does
not
concern
me
and
which
he
must
discuss
with
you
so
saying
beevor
retired
to
his
own
room
and
shut
the
door
with
the
same
irreproachable
discretion
which
conveyed
that
he
was
not
in
the
least
surprised
but
was
too
much
of
a
gentleman
to
show
it
well
wackerbath
began
horace
when
they
were
alone
so
disappointed
with
the
house
disappointed
said
wackerbath
furiously
i
am
disgusted
sir
disgusted
horace
heart
sank
lower
still
had
he
deceived
himself
after
all
then
had
he
been
nothing
but
a
conceited
fool
and
most
galling
thought
of
all
had
beevor
judged
him
only
too
accurately
and
yet
no
he
could
not
believe
it
he
his
work
was
good
this
is
plain
speaking
with
a
vengeance
he
said
i
sorry
dissatisfied
i
did
my
best
to
carry
out
your
instructions
oh
you
did
sputtered
wackerbath
that
what
you
call
but
go
on
sir
on
i
got
it
done
as
quickly
as
possible
continued
horace
because
i
understood
you
wished
no
time
to
be
lost
no
one
can
accuse
you
of
dawdling
over
it
what
i
should
like
to
know
is
how
the
devil
you
managed
to
get
it
done
in
the
time
i
worked
incessantly
all
day
and
every
day
said
horace
that
how
i
managed
it
and
this
is
all
the
thanks
i
get
for
it
thanks
wackerbath
howled
you
you
insolent
young
charlatan
you
expect
thanks
now
look
here
wackerbath
said
horace
whose
own
temper
was
getting
a
little
frayed
i
not
accustomed
to
being
treated
like
this
and
i
do
intend
to
submit
to
it
just
tell
me
in
as
moderate
language
as
you
can
command
what
you
object
to
i
object
to
the
whole
damned
thing
sir
i
mean
i
repudiate
the
entire
concern
it
the
work
of
a
raving
lunatic
a
place
that
no
english
gentleman
sir
with
any
or
ah
consideration
for
his
reputation
and
position
in
the
county
could
consent
to
occupy
for
a
single
hour
oh
said
horace
feeling
deathly
sick
in
that
case
it
is
useless
of
course
to
suggest
any
modifications
absolutely
said
wackerbath
very
well
then
there
no
more
to
be
said
replied
horace
you
will
have
no
difficulty
in
finding
an
architect
who
will
be
more
successful
in
realising
your
intentions
beevor
the
gentleman
you
met
just
now
he
added
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
would
probably
be
just
your
man
of
course
i
retire
altogether
and
really
if
any
one
is
the
sufferer
over
this
i
fancy
it
myself
i
ca
see
how
you
are
any
the
worse
not
any
the
worse
cried
wackerbath
when
the
infernal
place
is
built
built
echoed
horace
feebly
i
tell
you
sir
i
saw
it
with
my
own
eyes
driving
to
the
station
this
morning
my
coachman
and
footman
saw
it
my
wife
saw
it
damn
it
sir
we
saw
it
then
horace
understood
his
indefatigable
jinnee
had
been
at
work
again
of
course
for
fakrash
it
must
have
been
what
he
would
term
the
easiest
of
affairs
especially
after
a
glance
at
the
plans
and
ventimore
remembered
that
the
jinnee
had
surprised
him
at
work
upon
them
and
even
requested
to
have
them
explained
to
him
to
dispense
with
contractors
and
bricklayers
and
carpenters
and
construct
the
entire
building
in
the
course
of
a
single
night
it
was
a
generous
and
spirited
action
but
particularly
now
that
the
original
designs
had
been
found
faulty
and
rejected
it
placed
the
unfortunate
architect
in
a
most
invidious
position
well
sir
said
wackerbath
with
elaborate
irony
i
presume
it
is
you
whom
i
have
to
thank
for
improving
my
land
by
erecting
this
precious
palace
on
it
i
i
began
horace
utterly
broken
down
and
then
he
saw
with
emotions
that
may
be
imagined
the
jinnee
himself
in
his
green
robes
standing
immediately
behind
wackerbath
greeting
to
you
said
fakrash
coming
forward
with
his
smile
of
amiable
cunning
if
i
mistake
not
he
added
addressing
the
startled
estate
agent
who
had
jumped
visibly
thou
art
the
merchant
for
whom
my
son
here
and
he
laid
a
hand
on
horace
shrinking
shoulder
undertook
to
construct
a
mansion
i
am
said
wackerbath
in
some
mystification
have
i
the
pleasure
of
addressing
ventimore
senior
no
no
put
in
horace
no
relation
he
a
sort
of
informal
partner
hast
thou
not
found
him
an
architect
of
divine
gifts
inquired
the
jinnee
beaming
with
pride
is
not
the
palace
that
he
hath
raised
for
thee
by
his
transcendent
accomplishments
a
marvel
of
beauty
and
stateliness
and
one
that
sultans
might
envy
no
sir
shouted
the
infuriated
wackerbath
since
you
ask
my
opinion
it
nothing
of
the
sort
it
a
ridiculous
cross
between
the
at
kew
and
the
brighton
pavilion
there
no
and
not
a
decent
bedroom
in
the
house
i
been
all
over
it
so
i
ought
to
know
and
as
for
drainage
there
is
a
sign
of
it
and
he
has
the
brass
ah
i
should
say
the
unblushing
effrontery
to
call
that
a
country
house
horace
dismay
was
curiously
shot
with
relief
the
jinnee
who
was
certainly
very
far
from
being
a
genius
except
by
courtesy
had
taken
it
upon
himself
to
erect
the
palace
according
to
his
own
notions
of
arabian
domestic
luxury
and
horace
taught
by
bitter
experience
could
sympathise
to
some
extent
with
his
unfortunate
client
on
the
other
hand
it
was
balm
to
his
smarting
to
find
that
it
was
not
his
own
plans
after
all
which
had
been
found
so
preposterous
and
by
some
obscure
mental
process
which
i
do
not
propose
to
explain
he
became
reconciled
and
almost
grateful
to
the
officious
fakrash
and
then
too
he
was
jinnee
and
horace
had
no
intention
of
letting
him
be
bullied
by
an
outsider
let
me
explain
wackerbath
he
said
personally
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
this
gentleman
wishing
to
spare
me
the
trouble
has
taken
upon
himself
to
build
your
house
for
you
without
consulting
either
of
us
and
from
what
i
know
of
his
powers
in
the
direction
no
doubt
that
that
it
a
devilish
fine
place
in
its
way
anyhow
we
make
no
charge
for
it
he
presents
it
to
you
as
a
free
gift
why
not
accept
it
as
such
and
make
the
best
of
it
make
the
best
of
it
stormed
wackerbath
stand
by
and
see
the
best
site
in
three
counties
defaced
by
a
jimcrack
moorish
nightmare
like
that
why
they
call
it
folly
sir
i
shall
be
the
of
the
neighbourhood
i
ca
live
in
the
beastly
building
i
could
afford
to
keep
it
up
and
i
wo
have
it
cumbering
my
land
do
you
hear
wo
i
go
to
law
cost
me
what
it
may
and
compel
you
and
your
arabian
friends
there
to
pull
the
thing
down
i
take
the
case
up
to
the
house
of
lords
if
necessary
and
fight
you
as
long
as
i
can
stand
as
long
as
thou
canst
stand
repeated
fakrash
gently
that
is
a
long
time
truly
o
thou
litigious
one
on
all
fours
ungrateful
dog
that
thou
art
he
cried
with
an
abrupt
and
entire
change
of
manner
and
crawl
henceforth
for
the
remainder
of
thy
days
i
command
thee
it
was
both
painful
and
grotesque
to
see
the
portly
and
intensely
respectable
wackerbath
suddenly
drop
forward
on
his
hands
while
desperately
striving
to
preserve
his
dignity
how
dare
you
sir
he
almost
barked
how
you
i
say
are
you
aware
that
i
could
summon
you
for
this
let
me
up
i
upon
getting
up
o
contemptible
in
aspect
replied
the
jinnee
throwing
open
the
door
begone
to
thy
kennel
i
wo
i
ca
whimpered
the
unhappy
man
how
do
you
expect
me
me
to
cross
westminster
bridge
on
all
fours
what
will
the
officials
think
at
waterloo
where
i
have
been
known
and
respected
for
years
how
am
i
to
face
my
family
in
in
this
position
do
for
sake
let
me
get
up
horace
had
been
too
shocked
and
startled
to
speak
before
but
now
humanity
coupled
with
disgust
for
the
jinnee
methods
compelled
him
to
interfere
fakrash
he
said
this
has
gone
far
enough
unless
you
stop
tormenting
this
unfortunate
gentleman
i
done
with
you
never
said
fakrash
he
hath
dared
to
abuse
my
palace
which
is
far
too
sumptuous
a
dwelling
for
such
a
son
of
a
burnt
dog
as
he
therefore
i
will
make
his
abode
to
be
in
the
dust
for
ever
but
i
find
fault
yelped
poor
wackerbath
you
you
entirely
misunderstood
the
the
few
comments
i
ventured
to
make
it
a
capital
mansion
handsome
and
yet
too
i
never
say
another
word
against
it
i
yes
i
in
it
if
only
you
let
me
up
do
as
he
asks
you
said
horace
to
the
jinnee
or
i
swear
i
never
speak
to
you
again
thou
art
the
arbiter
of
this
matter
was
the
reply
and
if
i
yield
it
is
at
thy
intercession
and
not
his
rise
then
he
said
to
the
humiliated
client
depart
and
show
us
the
breadth
of
thy
shoulders
it
was
this
precise
moment
which
beevor
who
was
probably
unable
to
restrain
his
curiosity
any
longer
chose
to
the
room
oh
ventimore
he
began
did
i
leave
my
i
beg
your
pardon
i
thought
you
were
alone
again
do
go
sir
said
wackerbath
as
he
scrambled
awkwardly
to
his
feet
his
usually
florid
face
mottled
in
grey
and
lilac
i
i
should
like
you
to
know
that
after
talking
things
quietly
over
with
your
friend
ventimore
and
his
partner
here
i
am
thoroughly
convinced
that
my
objections
were
quite
untenable
i
retract
all
i
said
the
house
is
ah
admirably
planned
convenient
roomy
and
ah
unconventional
the
the
entire
freedom
from
all
sanitary
appliances
is
a
particular
recommendation
in
short
i
am
more
than
satisfied
pray
forget
anything
i
may
have
said
which
might
be
taken
to
imply
the
contrary
gentlemen
good
afternoon
he
bowed
himself
past
the
jinnee
in
a
state
of
deference
and
apprehension
and
was
heard
stumbling
down
the
staircase
horace
hardly
dared
to
meet
beevor
eyes
which
were
fixed
upon
the
jinnee
as
he
stood
apart
in
dreamy
abstraction
smiling
placidly
to
himself
i
say
beevor
said
to
horace
at
last
in
an
undertone
you
never
told
me
you
had
gone
into
partnership
he
not
a
regular
partner
whispered
ventimore
he
does
odd
things
for
me
occasionally
that
all
he
soon
managed
to
smooth
your
client
down
remarked
beevor
yes
said
horace
he
an
oriental
you
see
and
he
has
a
a
very
persuasive
manner
would
you
like
to
be
introduced
if
it
all
the
same
to
you
replied
beevor
still
below
his
voice
i
rather
be
excused
to
tell
you
the
truth
old
fellow
i
altogether
fancy
the
looks
of
him
and
it
my
opinion
he
added
that
the
less
you
have
to
do
with
him
the
better
he
strikes
me
as
a
old
man
no
no
said
horace
eccentric
that
all
you
do
understand
him
receive
news
began
the
jinnee
after
beevor
with
suspicion
and
disapproval
evident
even
on
his
back
and
shoulders
had
retreated
to
his
own
room
suleyman
the
son
of
daood
sleeps
with
his
fathers
i
know
retorted
horace
whose
nerves
were
unequal
to
much
reference
to
solomon
just
then
so
does
queen
anne
i
have
not
heard
of
her
but
art
thou
not
astounded
then
by
my
tidings
i
have
matters
nearer
home
to
think
about
said
horace
dryly
i
must
say
fakrash
you
have
landed
me
in
a
pretty
mess
explain
thyself
more
fully
for
i
comprehend
thee
not
why
on
earth
horace
groaned
could
you
let
me
build
that
house
my
own
way
did
i
not
hear
thee
with
my
own
ears
lament
thy
inability
to
perform
the
task
thereupon
i
determined
that
no
disgrace
should
fall
upon
thee
by
reason
of
such
incompetence
since
i
myself
would
erect
a
palace
so
splendid
that
it
should
cause
thy
name
to
live
for
ever
and
behold
it
is
done
it
is
said
horace
and
so
am
i
do
want
to
reproach
you
i
quite
feel
that
you
have
acted
with
the
best
intentions
but
oh
hang
it
all
you
see
that
you
absolutely
wrecked
my
career
as
an
architect
that
is
a
thing
that
can
not
be
returned
the
jinnee
seeing
that
thou
hast
all
the
credit
the
credit
this
is
england
not
arabia
what
credit
can
i
gain
from
being
supposed
to
be
the
architect
of
an
oriental
pavilion
which
might
be
all
very
well
for
but
i
can
assure
you
is
preposterous
as
a
home
for
an
average
briton
yet
that
overfed
hound
remarked
the
jinnee
expressed
much
gratification
therewith
naturally
after
he
had
found
that
he
could
not
give
a
candid
opinion
except
on
a
valuable
testimonial
that
and
how
do
you
suppose
i
can
take
his
money
no
fakrash
if
i
have
to
go
on
myself
for
it
i
must
say
and
i
will
say
that
you
made
a
most
frightful
muddle
of
it
acquaint
me
with
thy
wishes
said
fakrash
a
little
abashed
for
thou
knowest
that
i
can
refuse
thee
naught
then
said
horace
boldly
could
you
remove
that
palace
dissipate
it
into
space
or
something
verily
said
the
jinnee
in
an
aggravated
tone
to
do
good
acts
unto
such
as
thee
is
but
wasted
time
for
thou
givest
me
no
peace
till
they
are
undone
this
is
the
last
time
urged
horace
i
promise
never
to
ask
you
for
anything
again
not
for
the
first
time
hast
thou
made
such
a
promise
said
fakrash
and
save
for
the
magnitude
of
thy
service
unto
me
i
would
not
hearken
to
this
caprice
of
thine
nor
wilt
thou
find
me
so
indulgent
on
another
occasion
but
for
this
once
and
he
muttered
some
words
and
made
a
sweeping
gesture
with
his
right
hand
thy
desire
is
granted
unto
thee
of
the
palace
and
all
that
is
therein
there
remaineth
no
trace
another
surprise
for
poor
old
wackerbath
thought
horace
but
a
pleasant
one
this
time
my
dear
fakrash
he
said
aloud
i
really
ca
say
how
grateful
i
am
to
you
and
now
i
hate
bothering
you
like
this
but
if
you
manage
to
look
in
on
professor
futvoye
what
cried
the
jinnee
yet
another
request
already
well
you
promised
you
do
that
before
you
know
said
horace
for
that
matter
remarked
fakrash
i
have
already
fulfilled
my
promise
you
have
horace
exclaimed
and
does
he
believe
now
that
it
all
true
about
that
bottle
when
i
left
him
answered
the
jinnee
all
his
doubts
were
removed
by
jove
you
a
trump
cried
horace
only
too
glad
to
be
able
to
commend
with
sincerity
and
do
you
think
if
i
went
to
him
now
i
should
find
him
the
same
as
usual
nay
said
fakrash
with
his
weak
and
yet
inscrutable
smile
that
is
more
than
i
can
promise
thee
but
why
asked
horace
if
he
knows
all
there
was
the
oddest
expression
in
the
jinnee
furtive
eyes
a
kind
of
elfin
mischief
combined
with
a
sense
of
like
a
naughty
child
whose
palate
is
still
reminiscent
of
illicit
jam
because
he
replied
with
a
sound
between
a
giggle
and
a
chuckle
because
in
order
to
overcome
his
unbelief
it
was
necessary
to
transform
him
into
a
mule
of
hideous
appearance
cried
horace
but
whether
to
avoid
thanks
or
explanations
the
jinnee
had
disappeared
with
his
customary
abruptness
fakrash
shouted
horace
fakrash
come
back
do
you
hear
i
speak
to
you
there
was
no
answer
the
jinnee
might
be
well
on
his
way
to
lake
chad
or
jericho
by
that
time
he
was
certainly
far
enough
from
great
cloister
street
horace
sat
down
at
his
and
his
head
buried
in
his
hands
tried
to
think
out
this
latest
complication
fakrash
had
transformed
professor
futvoye
into
a
mule
it
would
have
seemed
incredible
almost
unthinkable
once
but
so
many
impossibilities
had
happened
to
horace
of
late
that
one
more
made
little
or
no
strain
upon
his
credulity
what
he
felt
chiefly
was
the
new
barrier
that
this
event
must
raise
between
himself
and
sylvia
to
do
him
justice
the
mere
fact
that
the
father
of
his
was
a
mule
did
not
lessen
his
ardour
in
the
slightest
even
if
he
had
felt
no
personal
responsibility
for
the
calamity
he
loved
sylvia
far
too
well
to
be
deterred
by
it
and
few
family
cupboards
are
without
a
skeleton
of
some
sort
with
courage
and
the
determination
to
look
only
on
the
bright
side
of
things
almost
any
domestic
drawback
can
be
lived
down
but
the
real
point
as
he
instantly
recognised
was
whether
in
the
changed
condition
of
circumstances
sylvia
would
consent
to
marry
might
she
not
after
the
experiences
of
that
abominable
dinner
of
his
the
night
before
connect
him
in
some
way
with
her
poor
transformation
she
might
even
suspect
him
of
employing
this
means
of
compelling
the
professor
to
renew
their
engagement
and
indeed
horace
was
by
no
means
certain
himself
that
the
jinnee
might
not
have
acted
from
some
motive
of
this
kind
it
was
likely
enough
that
the
professor
after
learning
the
truth
should
have
refused
to
allow
his
daughter
to
marry
the
of
so
dubious
a
patron
and
that
fakrash
had
then
resorted
to
pressure
in
any
case
ventimore
knew
sylvia
well
enough
to
feel
sure
that
pride
would
steel
her
heart
against
him
so
long
as
this
obstacle
remained
it
would
be
unseemly
to
set
down
here
all
that
horace
said
and
thought
of
the
person
who
had
brought
all
this
upon
them
but
after
some
wild
and
futile
raving
he
became
calm
enough
to
recognise
that
his
proper
place
was
by
sylvia
side
perhaps
he
ought
to
have
told
her
at
first
and
then
she
would
have
been
less
unprepared
for
this
and
yet
how
could
he
trouble
her
mind
so
long
as
he
could
cling
to
the
hope
that
the
jinnee
would
cease
to
interfere
but
now
he
could
be
silent
no
longer
naturally
the
prospect
of
calling
at
cottesmore
gardens
just
then
was
anything
but
agreeable
but
he
felt
it
would
be
cowardly
to
keep
away
besides
he
could
cheer
them
up
he
could
bring
with
him
a
message
of
hope
no
doubt
they
believed
that
the
professor
transformation
would
be
permanent
a
harrowing
prospect
for
so
united
a
family
but
fortunately
horace
would
be
able
to
reassure
them
on
this
point
fakrash
had
always
revoked
his
previous
performances
as
soon
as
he
could
be
brought
to
understand
their
fatuity
and
ventimore
would
take
good
care
that
he
revoked
this
nevertheless
it
was
with
a
sinking
heart
and
an
unsteady
hand
that
he
pulled
the
visitors
bell
at
the
futvoyes
house
that
afternoon
for
he
neither
knew
in
what
state
he
should
find
that
afflicted
family
nor
how
they
would
regard
his
intrusion
at
such
a
time
chapter
xii
the
messenger
of
hope
jessie
the
neat
and
pretty
opened
the
door
with
a
smile
of
welcome
which
horace
found
reassuring
no
girl
he
thought
whose
master
had
suddenly
been
transformed
into
a
mule
could
possibly
smile
like
that
the
professor
she
told
him
was
not
at
home
which
again
was
comforting
for
a
however
careless
about
his
personal
appearance
would
scarcely
venture
to
brave
public
opinion
in
the
semblance
of
a
quadruped
is
the
professor
out
he
inquired
to
make
sure
not
exactly
out
sir
said
the
maid
but
particularly
engaged
working
hard
in
his
study
and
not
to
be
disturbed
on
no
account
this
was
encouraging
too
since
a
mule
could
hardly
engage
in
literary
labour
of
any
kind
evidently
the
jinnee
must
either
have
overrated
his
supernatural
powers
or
else
have
been
deliberately
amusing
himself
at
horace
expense
then
i
will
see
miss
futvoye
he
said
miss
sylvia
is
with
the
master
sir
said
the
girl
but
if
come
into
the
i
let
futvoye
know
you
are
here
he
had
not
been
in
the
long
before
futvoye
appeared
and
one
glance
at
her
face
confirmed
ventimore
worst
fears
outwardly
she
was
calm
enough
but
it
was
only
too
obvious
that
her
calmness
was
the
result
of
severe
her
eyes
usually
so
shrewdly
and
placidly
observant
had
a
haggard
and
hunted
look
her
ears
seemed
on
the
strain
to
catch
some
distant
sound
i
hardly
thought
we
should
see
you
she
began
in
a
tone
of
studied
reserve
but
perhaps
you
came
to
offer
some
explanation
of
the
extraordinary
manner
in
which
you
thought
fit
to
entertain
us
last
night
if
so
the
fact
is
said
horace
looking
into
his
hat
i
came
because
i
was
rather
anxious
about
the
professor
about
my
husband
said
the
poor
lady
with
a
really
heroic
effort
to
appear
surprised
he
is
as
well
as
could
be
expected
why
should
you
suppose
otherwise
she
asked
with
a
flash
of
suspicion
i
fancied
perhaps
that
that
he
might
be
quite
himself
said
horace
with
his
eyes
on
the
carpet
i
see
said
futvoye
regaining
her
composure
you
were
afraid
that
all
those
foreign
dishes
might
not
have
agreed
with
him
but
except
that
he
is
a
little
irritable
this
afternoon
he
is
much
as
usual
i
delighted
to
hear
it
said
horace
with
reviving
hope
do
you
think
he
would
see
me
for
a
moment
great
heavens
no
cried
futvoye
with
an
irrepressible
start
i
mean
she
explained
that
after
what
took
place
last
night
anthony
my
husband
very
properly
feels
that
an
interview
would
be
too
painful
but
when
we
parted
he
was
perfectly
friendly
i
can
only
say
replied
the
courageous
woman
that
you
would
find
him
considerably
altered
now
horace
had
no
difficulty
in
believing
it
at
least
i
may
see
sylvia
he
pleaded
no
said
futvoye
i
really
ca
have
sylvia
disturbed
just
now
she
is
very
busy
helping
her
father
anthony
has
to
read
a
paper
at
one
of
his
societies
night
and
she
is
writing
it
out
from
his
dictation
if
any
departure
from
strict
truth
can
ever
be
excusable
this
surely
was
one
unfortunately
just
then
sylvia
herself
burst
into
the
room
mother
she
cried
without
seeing
horace
in
her
agitation
do
come
to
papa
quick
he
has
just
begun
kicking
again
and
i
ca
manage
him
alone
oh
here
she
broke
off
as
she
saw
who
was
in
the
room
why
do
you
come
here
now
horace
please
go
away
papa
is
rather
unwell
nothing
serious
only
oh
go
away
darling
said
horace
going
to
her
and
taking
both
her
hands
i
know
all
do
you
understand
mamma
cried
sylvia
reproachfully
have
you
told
him
already
when
we
settled
that
even
horace
was
to
know
till
till
papa
recovers
i
have
told
him
nothing
my
dear
replied
her
mother
he
possibly
know
unless
but
no
that
is
possible
and
after
all
she
added
with
a
warning
glance
at
her
daughter
i
do
know
why
we
should
make
any
mystery
about
a
mere
attack
of
gout
but
i
had
better
go
and
see
if
your
father
wants
anything
and
she
hurried
out
of
the
room
sylvia
sat
down
and
gazed
silently
into
the
fire
i
dare
say
you
know
how
dreadfully
people
kick
when
they
got
gout
she
remarked
presently
oh
yes
i
do
said
horace
sympathetically
at
least
i
can
guess
especially
when
it
in
both
legs
continued
sylvia
or
said
horace
gently
in
all
four
ah
you
know
cried
sylvia
then
it
all
the
more
horrid
of
you
to
come
dearest
said
horace
is
not
this
just
the
time
when
my
place
should
be
near
you
and
him
not
near
papa
horace
she
put
in
anxiously
it
would
be
at
all
safe
do
you
really
think
i
have
any
fear
for
myself
are
you
sure
you
quite
know
what
he
is
like
now
i
understand
said
horace
trying
to
put
it
as
considerately
as
possible
that
a
casual
observer
who
did
know
your
father
might
mistake
him
at
first
sight
for
for
some
sort
of
quadruped
he
a
mule
sobbed
sylvia
breaking
down
entirely
i
could
bear
it
better
if
he
had
been
a
mule
b
but
he
is
whatever
he
may
be
declared
horace
as
he
knelt
by
her
chair
endeavouring
to
comfort
her
nothing
can
alter
my
profound
respect
for
him
and
you
must
let
me
see
him
sylvia
because
i
fully
believe
i
shall
be
able
to
cheer
him
up
if
you
imagine
you
can
persuade
him
to
to
laugh
it
off
said
sylvia
tearfully
i
was
proposing
to
try
to
make
him
see
the
humorous
side
of
his
situation
horace
mildly
explained
i
trust
i
have
more
tact
than
that
but
he
may
be
glad
to
know
that
at
the
worst
it
is
only
a
temporary
inconvenience
i
take
care
that
he
all
right
again
before
very
long
she
started
up
and
looked
at
him
her
eyes
widened
with
dawning
dread
and
mistrust
if
you
can
speak
like
that
she
said
it
must
have
been
who
no
i
ca
believe
it
that
would
be
too
horrible
i
who
did
sylvia
were
you
there
when
when
it
happened
no
she
replied
i
was
only
told
of
it
afterwards
mother
heard
papa
talking
loudly
in
his
study
this
morning
as
if
he
was
angry
with
somebody
and
at
last
she
grew
so
uneasy
she
could
bear
it
any
longer
and
went
in
to
see
what
was
the
matter
with
him
dad
was
quite
alone
and
looked
as
usual
only
a
little
excited
and
then
without
the
slightest
warning
just
as
she
entered
the
room
he
he
changed
slowly
into
a
mule
before
her
eyes
anybody
but
mamma
would
have
lost
her
head
and
roused
the
whole
house
thank
heaven
she
did
said
horace
fervently
that
was
what
i
was
most
afraid
of
then
oh
horace
it
you
it
no
use
denying
it
i
feel
more
certain
of
it
every
moment
now
sylvia
he
protested
still
anxious
if
possible
to
keep
the
worst
from
her
what
could
have
put
such
an
idea
as
that
into
your
head
i
do
know
she
said
slowly
several
things
last
night
no
one
who
was
really
nice
and
like
everybody
else
would
live
in
such
queer
rooms
like
those
and
dine
on
cushions
with
dreadful
black
slaves
and
and
and
things
you
pretended
you
were
quite
poor
so
i
am
darling
and
as
for
my
rooms
and
and
the
rest
they
all
gone
sylvia
if
you
went
to
vincent
square
you
would
find
a
trace
of
them
that
only
shows
said
sylvia
but
why
should
you
play
such
a
cruel
and
and
ungentlemanly
trick
on
poor
dad
if
you
had
ever
really
loved
me
but
i
do
sylvia
you
ca
really
believe
me
capable
of
such
an
outrage
look
at
me
and
tell
me
so
no
horace
said
sylvia
frankly
i
do
believe
did
it
but
i
believe
you
know
who
and
you
had
better
tell
me
at
once
if
you
quite
sure
you
can
stand
it
he
replied
i
tell
you
everything
and
as
briefly
as
possible
he
told
her
how
he
had
unsealed
the
brass
bottle
and
all
that
had
come
of
it
she
bore
it
on
the
whole
better
than
he
had
expected
perhaps
being
a
woman
it
was
some
consolation
to
her
to
remind
him
that
she
had
foretold
something
of
this
kind
from
the
very
first
but
of
course
i
never
really
thought
it
would
be
so
awful
as
this
she
said
horace
how
you
be
so
careless
as
to
let
a
great
wicked
thing
like
that
escape
out
of
its
bottle
i
had
a
notion
it
was
a
manuscript
said
horace
till
he
came
out
but
he
is
a
great
wicked
thing
sylvia
he
an
amiable
old
jinnee
enough
and
he
do
anything
for
me
nobody
could
be
more
grateful
and
generous
than
he
has
been
do
you
call
it
generous
to
change
the
poor
dear
dad
into
a
mule
inquired
sylvia
with
a
little
curl
of
her
upper
lip
that
was
an
oversight
said
horace
he
meant
no
harm
by
it
in
arabia
they
do
these
things
or
used
to
in
his
day
not
that
that
much
excuse
for
him
still
he
not
so
young
as
he
was
and
besides
being
bottled
up
for
all
those
centuries
must
have
narrowed
him
rather
you
must
try
and
make
allowances
for
him
darling
i
sha
said
sylvia
unless
he
apologises
to
poor
father
and
puts
him
right
at
once
why
of
course
he
do
that
horace
answered
confidently
i
see
that
he
does
i
do
mean
to
stand
any
more
of
his
nonsense
i
afraid
i
been
just
a
little
too
slack
for
fear
of
hurting
his
feelings
but
this
time
he
gone
too
far
and
i
shall
talk
to
him
like
a
dutch
uncle
he
always
ready
to
do
the
right
thing
when
he
once
shown
where
he
has
gone
wrong
only
he
takes
such
a
lot
of
showing
poor
old
chap
but
when
do
you
think
he
do
the
right
thing
oh
as
soon
as
i
see
him
again
yes
but
when
you
see
him
again
that
more
than
i
can
say
he
away
just
now
in
china
or
peru
or
somewhere
horace
then
he
wo
be
back
for
months
and
months
oh
yes
he
will
he
can
do
the
whole
trip
et
you
know
in
a
few
hours
he
an
active
old
beggar
for
his
age
in
the
meantime
dearest
the
chief
thing
is
to
keep
up
your
father
spirits
so
i
think
i
better
i
was
just
telling
sylvia
futvoye
he
said
as
that
lady
the
room
that
i
should
like
to
see
the
professor
at
once
it
quite
impossible
was
the
nervous
reply
he
in
such
a
state
that
he
unable
to
see
any
one
you
do
know
how
fractious
gout
makes
him
dear
futvoye
said
horace
believe
me
i
know
more
than
you
suppose
yes
mother
dear
put
in
sylvia
he
knows
everything
everything
and
perhaps
it
might
do
dad
good
to
see
him
futvoye
sank
helplessly
down
on
a
settee
oh
dear
me
she
said
i
do
know
to
say
i
really
do
if
you
had
seen
him
plunge
at
the
mere
suggestion
of
a
doctor
privately
though
naturally
he
could
not
say
so
horace
thought
a
vet
might
be
more
appropriate
but
eventually
he
persuaded
futvoye
to
conduct
him
to
her
husband
study
anthony
love
she
said
as
she
knocked
gently
at
the
door
brought
horace
ventimore
to
see
you
for
a
few
moments
if
he
may
it
seemed
from
the
sounds
of
furious
snorting
and
stamping
within
that
the
professor
resented
this
intrusion
on
his
privacy
my
dear
anthony
said
his
devoted
wife
as
she
unlocked
the
door
and
turned
the
key
on
the
inside
after
admitting
horace
try
to
be
calm
think
of
the
servants
downstairs
horace
is
anxious
to
help
as
for
ventimore
he
was
speechless
so
inexpressibly
shocked
was
he
by
the
alteration
in
the
professor
appearance
he
had
never
seen
a
mule
in
sorrier
condition
or
in
so
vicious
a
temper
most
of
the
lighter
furniture
had
been
already
reduced
to
matchwood
the
glass
doors
of
the
bookcase
were
starred
or
shivered
precious
egyptian
pottery
and
glass
were
strewn
in
fragments
on
the
carpets
and
even
the
mummy
though
it
still
smiled
with
the
same
enigmatic
cheerfulness
seemed
to
have
suffered
severely
from
the
professorial
hoofs
horace
instinctively
felt
that
any
words
of
conventional
sympathy
would
jar
here
indeed
the
professor
attitude
and
expression
reminded
him
irresistibly
of
a
certain
blondin
donkey
he
had
seen
enacted
by
artists
at
the
point
where
it
becomes
sullen
and
defiant
only
he
had
laughed
helplessly
at
the
blondin
donkey
and
somehow
he
felt
no
inclination
to
laugh
now
believe
me
sir
he
began
i
would
not
disturb
you
like
this
unless
steady
there
for
heaven
sake
professor
do
kick
till
you
heard
me
out
for
the
mule
in
a
clumsy
shambling
way
which
betrayed
the
novice
was
slowly
revolving
on
his
own
axis
so
as
to
bring
his
into
action
while
still
keeping
his
only
serviceable
eye
upon
his
unwelcome
visitor
listen
to
me
sir
said
horace
manoeuvring
in
his
turn
i
not
to
blame
for
this
and
if
you
brain
me
as
you
seem
to
be
endeavouring
to
do
you
simply
destroy
the
only
living
man
who
can
get
you
out
of
this
the
mule
appeared
impressed
by
this
and
backed
cumbrously
into
a
corner
from
which
he
regarded
horace
with
a
mistrustful
but
attentive
eye
if
as
i
imagine
sir
continued
horace
you
are
though
temporarily
deprived
of
speech
perfectly
capable
of
following
an
argument
will
you
kindly
signify
it
by
raising
your
right
ear
the
mule
right
ear
rose
with
a
sharp
twitch
now
we
can
get
on
said
horace
first
let
me
tell
you
that
i
repudiate
all
responsibility
for
the
proceedings
of
that
infernal
jinnee
i
would
stamp
like
that
you
might
go
through
the
floor
you
know
now
if
you
will
only
exercise
a
little
patience
at
this
the
exasperated
animal
made
a
sudden
run
at
him
with
his
mouth
open
which
obliged
horace
to
shelter
himself
behind
a
large
leather
you
really
keep
cool
sir
he
remonstrated
your
nerves
are
naturally
upset
if
i
might
suggest
a
little
champagne
you
could
manage
it
in
in
a
bucket
and
it
would
help
you
to
pull
yourself
together
a
whisk
of
your
er
tail
would
imply
consent
the
professor
tail
instantly
swept
some
rare
arabian
glass
lamps
and
vases
from
a
shelf
at
his
rear
whereupon
futvoye
went
out
and
returned
presently
with
a
bottle
of
champagne
and
a
large
china
as
the
best
substitute
she
could
find
for
a
bucket
when
the
mule
had
drained
the
greedily
and
appeared
refreshed
horace
proceeded
i
have
every
hope
sir
he
said
that
before
many
hours
you
will
be
smiling
pray
do
prance
like
that
i
mean
what
i
say
smiling
over
what
now
seems
to
you
very
justly
a
most
annoying
and
serious
catastrophe
i
shall
speak
seriously
to
fakrash
the
jinnee
you
know
and
i
am
sure
that
as
soon
as
he
realises
what
a
frightful
blunder
he
has
made
he
will
be
the
first
to
offer
you
every
reparation
in
his
power
for
old
foozle
as
he
is
he
thoroughly
the
professor
drooped
his
ears
at
this
and
shook
his
head
with
a
doleful
incredulity
that
made
him
look
more
like
the
pantomime
donkey
than
ever
i
think
i
understand
him
fairly
well
by
this
time
sir
said
horace
and
i
answer
for
it
that
there
no
real
harm
in
him
i
give
you
my
word
of
honour
that
if
you
only
remain
quiet
and
leave
everything
to
me
you
shall
very
soon
be
released
from
this
absurd
position
all
i
came
to
tell
you
and
now
i
wo
trouble
you
any
longer
if
you
bring
yourself
as
a
sign
that
you
bear
me
no
to
give
me
your
your
at
parting
i
but
the
professor
turned
his
back
in
so
pointed
and
ominous
a
manner
that
horace
judged
it
better
to
withdraw
without
insisting
further
afraid
he
said
to
futvoye
after
they
had
rejoined
sylvia
in
the
i
afraid
your
husband
is
still
a
little
sore
with
me
about
this
miserable
business
i
do
know
what
else
you
can
expect
replied
the
lady
rather
tartly
he
ca
help
feeling
as
we
all
must
and
do
after
what
you
said
just
now
that
but
for
you
this
would
never
have
happened
if
you
mean
it
was
all
through
my
attending
that
sale
said
horace
you
might
remember
that
i
only
went
there
at
the
professor
request
you
know
that
sylvia
yes
horace
said
sylvia
but
papa
never
asked
you
to
buy
a
hideous
brass
bottle
with
a
nasty
genius
in
it
and
any
one
with
ordinary
common
sense
would
have
kept
it
properly
corked
what
you
against
me
too
sylvia
cried
horace
cut
to
the
quick
no
horace
never
against
you
i
did
mean
to
say
what
i
did
only
it
such
a
relief
to
put
the
blame
on
somebody
i
know
i
you
feel
it
almost
as
much
as
we
do
but
so
long
as
poor
dear
papa
remains
as
he
is
we
can
never
be
anything
to
one
another
you
must
see
that
horace
yes
i
see
that
he
said
but
trust
me
sylvia
he
shall
remain
as
he
is
i
swear
he
shall
not
in
another
day
or
two
at
the
outside
you
will
see
him
his
own
self
once
more
and
then
oh
darling
darling
you
wo
let
anything
or
anybody
separate
us
promise
me
that
he
would
have
held
her
in
his
arms
but
she
kept
him
at
a
distance
when
papa
is
himself
again
she
said
i
shall
know
better
what
to
say
i
ca
promise
anything
now
horace
horace
recognised
that
no
appeal
would
draw
a
more
definite
answer
from
her
just
then
so
he
took
his
leave
with
the
feeling
that
after
all
matters
must
improve
before
very
long
and
in
the
meantime
he
must
bear
the
suspense
with
patience
he
got
through
dinner
as
well
as
he
could
in
his
own
rooms
for
he
did
not
like
to
go
to
his
club
lest
the
jinnee
should
suddenly
return
during
his
absence
if
he
wants
me
he
be
quite
equal
to
coming
on
to
the
club
after
me
he
reflected
for
he
has
about
as
much
sense
of
the
fitness
of
things
as
mary
lamb
i
should
care
about
seeing
him
suddenly
bursting
through
the
floor
of
the
nor
would
the
committee
he
sat
up
late
in
the
hope
that
fakrash
would
appear
but
the
jinnee
made
no
sign
and
horace
began
to
get
uneasy
i
wish
there
was
some
way
of
ringing
him
up
he
thought
if
he
were
only
the
slave
of
a
ring
or
a
lamp
i
rub
it
but
it
would
be
any
use
to
rub
that
bottle
and
besides
he
is
a
slave
probably
he
has
a
suspicion
that
he
has
not
exactly
distinguished
himself
over
his
latest
feat
and
thinks
it
prudent
to
keep
out
of
my
way
for
the
present
but
if
he
fancies
he
make
things
any
better
for
himself
by
that
he
find
himself
mistaken
it
was
maddening
to
think
of
the
unhappy
professor
still
fretting
away
hour
after
hour
in
the
uncongenial
form
of
a
mule
waiting
impatiently
for
the
relief
that
never
came
if
it
lingered
much
longer
he
might
actually
starve
unless
his
family
thought
of
getting
in
some
oats
for
him
and
he
could
be
prevailed
upon
to
touch
them
and
how
much
longer
could
they
succeed
in
concealing
the
nature
of
his
affliction
how
long
before
all
kensington
and
the
whole
civilised
world
would
know
that
one
of
the
leading
orientalists
in
europe
was
restlessly
prancing
on
four
legs
around
his
study
in
cottesmore
gardens
racked
by
speculations
such
as
these
ventimore
lay
awake
till
well
into
the
small
hours
when
he
dropped
off
into
troubled
dreams
that
wild
as
they
were
could
not
be
more
grotesquely
fantastic
than
the
realities
to
which
they
were
the
alternative
chapter
xiii
a
choice
of
evils
not
even
his
morning
tub
could
brace
ventimore
spirits
to
their
usual
cheerfulness
after
sending
away
his
breakfast
almost
untasted
he
stood
at
his
window
looking
drearily
out
over
the
crude
green
turf
of
vincent
square
at
the
indigo
masses
of
the
abbey
and
the
victoria
tower
and
the
huge
gasometers
to
the
right
which
loomed
faintly
through
a
haze
he
felt
a
positive
loathing
for
his
office
to
which
he
had
gone
with
such
high
hopes
and
enthusiasm
of
late
there
was
no
work
for
him
to
do
there
any
longer
and
the
sight
of
his
and
materials
would
he
knew
be
intolerable
in
their
mute
mockery
nor
could
he
with
any
decency
present
himself
again
at
cottesmore
gardens
while
the
situation
still
remained
unchanged
as
it
must
do
until
he
had
seen
fakrash
when
would
the
jinnee
return
or
horrible
suspicion
did
he
never
intend
to
return
at
all
fakrash
he
groaned
aloud
you
really
mean
to
leave
me
in
such
a
regular
deuce
of
a
hole
as
this
at
thy
service
said
a
voice
behind
him
and
he
turned
to
see
the
jinnee
standing
smiling
on
the
hearthrug
and
at
this
accomplishment
of
his
dearest
desire
all
his
indignation
surged
back
oh
you
are
he
said
irritably
where
on
earth
have
you
been
all
this
time
nowhere
on
earth
was
the
bland
reply
but
in
the
regions
of
the
air
seeking
to
promote
thy
welfare
if
you
have
been
as
brilliantly
successful
up
there
as
you
have
down
here
retorted
horace
i
have
much
to
thank
you
for
i
am
more
than
repaid
answered
the
jinnee
who
like
many
highly
estimable
persons
was
almost
impervious
to
irony
by
such
assurances
of
thy
gratitude
i
grateful
said
horace
fuming
i
devilish
annoyed
well
hath
it
been
written
replied
the
jinnee
disregardful
of
thine
affairs
and
commit
them
to
the
course
of
fate
for
often
a
thing
that
enrages
thee
may
eventually
be
to
thee
pleasing
i
do
see
the
remotest
chance
of
that
in
my
case
said
horace
why
is
thy
countenance
thus
troubled
and
what
new
complaint
hast
thou
against
me
what
the
devil
do
you
mean
by
turning
a
distinguished
and
perfectly
inoffensive
scholar
into
a
mule
horace
broke
out
if
that
is
your
idea
of
a
practical
joke
it
is
one
of
the
easiest
affairs
possible
said
the
jinnee
complacently
running
his
fingers
through
the
thin
strands
of
his
beard
i
have
accomplished
such
transformations
on
several
occasions
then
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
that
all
the
question
is
now
how
do
you
propose
to
restore
him
again
far
from
undoing
be
that
which
is
accomplished
was
the
sententious
answer
what
cried
horace
hardly
believing
his
ears
you
surely
do
mean
to
allow
that
unhappy
professor
to
remain
like
that
for
ever
do
you
none
can
alter
what
is
predestined
very
likely
not
but
it
was
decreed
that
a
learned
man
should
be
suddenly
degraded
to
a
beastly
mule
for
the
rest
of
his
life
destiny
would
be
such
a
fool
despise
not
mules
for
they
are
useful
and
valuable
animals
in
the
household
but
confound
it
all
have
you
no
imagination
ca
you
enter
at
all
into
the
feelings
of
a
man
a
man
of
wide
learning
and
reputation
suddenly
plunged
into
such
a
humiliating
condition
upon
his
own
head
be
it
said
fakrash
coldly
for
he
hath
brought
this
fate
upon
himself
well
how
do
you
suppose
that
you
have
helped
by
this
performance
will
it
make
him
any
the
more
disposed
to
consent
to
my
marrying
his
daughter
is
that
all
you
know
of
the
world
it
is
not
my
intention
that
thou
shouldst
take
his
daughter
to
wife
whether
you
approve
or
not
it
my
intention
to
marry
her
assuredly
she
will
not
marry
thee
so
long
as
her
father
remaineth
a
mule
there
i
agree
with
you
but
is
that
your
notion
of
doing
me
a
good
turn
i
did
not
consider
thy
interest
in
this
matter
then
will
you
be
good
enough
to
consider
it
now
i
have
pledged
my
word
that
he
shall
be
restored
to
his
original
form
not
only
my
happiness
is
at
stake
but
my
honour
by
failure
to
perform
the
impossible
none
can
lose
honour
and
this
is
a
thing
that
can
not
be
undone
can
not
be
undone
repeated
horace
feeling
a
cold
clutch
at
his
heart
why
because
said
the
jinnee
sullenly
i
have
forgotten
the
way
nonsense
retorted
horace
i
do
believe
it
why
he
urged
descending
to
flattery
you
such
a
clever
old
johnny
i
beg
your
pardon
i
meant
such
a
clever
old
you
can
do
anything
if
you
only
give
your
mind
to
it
just
look
at
the
way
you
changed
this
house
back
again
to
what
it
was
marvellous
that
was
the
veriest
trifle
said
fakrash
though
he
was
obviously
pleased
by
this
tribute
to
his
talent
this
would
be
a
different
affair
altogether
but
child
play
to
insinuated
horace
come
you
know
very
well
you
can
do
it
if
you
only
choose
it
may
be
as
thou
sayest
but
i
do
not
choose
then
i
think
said
horace
that
considering
the
obligation
you
admit
yourself
you
are
under
to
me
i
have
a
right
to
know
the
reason
the
reason
why
you
refuse
thy
claim
is
not
without
justice
answered
the
jinnee
after
a
pause
nor
can
i
decline
to
gratify
thee
that
right
cried
horace
i
knew
you
see
it
in
the
proper
light
when
it
was
once
put
to
you
now
do
lose
any
more
time
but
restore
that
unfortunate
man
at
once
as
you
promised
not
so
said
the
jinnee
i
promised
thee
a
reason
for
my
refusal
and
that
thou
shalt
have
know
then
o
my
son
that
this
indiscreet
one
had
by
some
vile
and
unhallowed
arts
divined
the
hidden
meaning
of
what
was
written
upon
the
seal
of
the
bottle
wherein
i
was
confined
and
was
preparing
to
reveal
the
same
unto
all
men
what
would
it
matter
to
you
if
he
did
much
for
the
writing
contained
a
false
and
lying
record
of
my
actions
if
it
is
all
lies
it
ca
do
you
any
harm
why
not
treat
them
with
the
contempt
they
deserve
they
are
not
lies
the
jinnee
admitted
reluctantly
well
never
mind
whatever
you
done
you
expiated
it
by
this
time
now
that
suleyman
is
no
more
it
is
my
desire
to
seek
out
my
kinsmen
of
the
green
jinn
and
live
out
my
days
in
amity
and
honour
how
can
that
be
if
they
hear
my
name
execrated
by
all
mortals
nobody
would
think
of
execrating
you
about
an
affair
three
thousand
years
old
it
too
stale
a
scandal
thou
speakest
without
understanding
i
tell
thee
that
if
men
knew
but
the
half
of
my
misdoings
said
fakrash
in
a
tone
not
altogether
free
from
a
kind
of
sombre
complacency
the
noise
of
them
would
rise
even
unto
the
uppermost
regions
and
scorn
and
loathing
would
be
my
portion
oh
it
not
so
bad
as
all
that
said
horace
who
had
a
private
impression
that
the
jinnee
past
would
probably
turn
out
to
be
chiefly
made
up
of
peccadilloes
but
anyway
i
sure
the
professor
will
readily
agree
to
keep
silence
about
it
and
as
you
have
of
course
got
the
seal
in
your
own
possession
again
nay
the
seal
is
still
in
his
possession
and
it
is
naught
to
me
where
it
is
deposited
said
fakrash
since
the
only
mortal
who
hath
deciphered
it
is
now
a
dumb
animal
not
at
all
said
horace
there
are
several
friends
of
his
who
could
decipher
that
inscription
quite
as
easily
as
he
did
is
this
the
truth
said
the
jinnee
in
visible
alarm
certainly
said
horace
within
the
last
quarter
of
a
century
archæology
has
made
great
strides
our
learned
men
can
now
read
babylonian
bricks
and
chaldean
tablets
as
easily
as
if
they
were
advertisements
on
galvanised
iron
you
may
think
you
been
extremely
clever
in
turning
the
professor
into
an
animal
but
you
probably
find
you
only
made
another
mistake
how
so
inquired
fakrash
well
said
horace
seeing
his
advantage
and
pushing
it
unscrupulously
now
that
in
your
infinite
wisdom
you
have
ordained
that
he
should
be
a
mule
he
naturally
ca
possess
property
therefore
all
his
effects
will
have
to
be
sold
and
amongst
them
will
be
that
seal
of
yours
which
like
many
other
things
in
his
collection
will
probably
be
bought
up
by
the
british
museum
where
it
will
be
examined
and
commented
upon
by
every
orientalist
in
europe
i
suppose
you
thought
of
all
that
o
young
man
of
marvellous
sagacity
said
the
jinnee
truly
i
had
omitted
to
consider
these
things
and
thou
hast
opened
my
eyes
in
time
for
i
will
present
myself
unto
this
and
adjure
him
to
reveal
where
he
hath
bestowed
this
seal
so
that
i
may
regain
it
he
ca
do
that
you
know
so
long
as
he
remains
a
mule
i
will
endow
him
with
speech
for
the
purpose
let
me
tell
you
this
said
horace
he
in
a
very
nasty
temper
just
now
naturally
enough
and
you
wo
get
anything
out
of
him
until
you
have
restored
him
to
human
form
if
you
do
that
he
agree
to
anything
whether
i
restore
him
or
not
will
depend
not
on
me
but
on
the
damsel
who
is
his
daughter
and
to
whom
thou
art
contracted
in
marriage
for
first
of
all
i
must
speak
with
her
so
long
as
i
am
present
and
you
promise
not
to
play
any
tricks
said
horace
i
no
objection
for
i
believe
if
you
once
saw
her
and
heard
her
plead
for
her
poor
father
you
would
have
the
heart
to
hold
out
any
longer
but
you
must
give
me
your
word
that
you
behave
yourself
thou
hast
it
said
the
jinnee
i
do
but
desire
to
see
her
on
thine
account
very
well
agreed
horace
but
i
really
ca
introduce
you
in
that
turban
she
be
terrified
could
you
contrive
to
get
yourself
up
in
commonplace
english
clothes
just
for
once
something
that
attract
so
much
attention
will
this
satisfy
thee
inquired
the
jinnee
as
his
green
turban
and
flowing
robes
suddenly
resolved
themselves
into
the
conventional
hat
and
trousers
of
modern
civilisation
he
bore
a
painful
resemblance
in
them
to
the
kind
of
elderly
gentleman
who
comes
on
in
the
harlequinade
to
be
bonneted
by
the
clown
but
horace
was
in
no
mood
to
be
critical
just
then
that
better
he
said
encouragingly
much
better
now
he
added
as
he
led
the
way
to
the
hall
and
put
on
his
own
hat
and
overcoat
go
out
and
find
a
hansom
and
be
at
kensington
in
less
than
twenty
minutes
we
shall
be
there
in
less
than
twenty
seconds
said
the
jinnee
seizing
him
by
the
arm
above
the
elbow
and
horace
found
himself
suddenly
carried
up
into
the
air
and
set
down
gasping
with
surprise
and
want
of
breath
on
the
pavement
opposite
the
futvoyes
door
i
should
just
like
to
observe
he
said
as
soon
as
he
could
speak
that
if
we
been
seen
we
shall
probably
cause
a
sensation
londoners
are
not
accustomed
to
seeing
people
skimming
over
the
like
amateur
rooks
trouble
not
for
that
said
fakrash
for
no
mortal
eyes
are
capable
of
following
our
flight
i
hope
not
said
horace
or
i
shall
lose
any
reputation
i
have
left
i
think
he
added
i
better
go
in
alone
first
and
prepare
them
if
you
do
mind
waiting
outside
i
come
to
the
window
and
wave
my
when
they
ready
and
come
in
by
the
door
like
an
ordinary
person
and
ask
the
maidservant
if
you
may
see
me
i
will
bear
it
in
mind
answered
the
jinnee
and
suddenly
sank
or
seemed
to
sink
through
a
chink
in
the
pavement
horace
after
ringing
at
the
futvoyes
door
was
admitted
and
shown
into
the
where
sylvia
presently
came
to
him
looking
as
lovely
as
ever
in
spite
of
the
pallor
due
to
sleeplessness
and
anxiety
it
is
kind
of
you
to
call
and
inquire
she
said
with
the
unnatural
calm
of
suppressed
hysteria
dad
is
much
the
same
this
morning
he
had
a
fairly
good
night
and
was
able
to
take
part
of
a
carrot
for
breakfast
but
i
afraid
he
has
just
remembered
that
he
has
to
read
a
paper
on
occultism
before
the
asiatic
society
this
evening
and
worrying
him
a
little
oh
horace
she
broke
out
unexpectedly
how
perfectly
awful
all
this
is
how
we
to
bear
it
do
give
way
darling
said
horace
you
will
not
have
to
bear
it
much
longer
it
all
very
well
horace
but
unless
something
is
done
it
will
be
too
late
we
ca
go
keeping
a
mule
in
the
study
without
the
servants
suspecting
something
and
where
are
we
to
put
poor
dear
papa
it
too
ghastly
to
think
of
his
having
to
be
sent
away
to
to
a
home
of
rest
for
horses
and
yet
what
to
be
done
with
him
why
do
you
come
if
you
ca
do
anything
i
should
be
here
unless
i
could
bring
you
good
news
you
remember
what
i
told
you
about
the
jinnee
remember
cried
sylvia
as
if
i
could
forget
has
he
really
come
back
horace
yes
i
think
i
have
brought
him
to
see
that
he
has
made
a
foolish
mistake
in
enchanting
your
unfortunate
father
and
he
seems
willing
to
undo
it
on
certain
conditions
he
is
somewhere
within
call
at
this
moment
and
will
come
in
whenever
i
give
the
signal
but
he
wishes
to
speak
to
you
first
to
oh
no
horace
exclaimed
sylvia
recoiling
i
so
much
rather
not
i
do
like
things
that
have
come
out
of
brass
bottles
i
should
know
what
to
say
and
it
would
frighten
me
horribly
you
must
be
brave
darling
said
horace
remember
that
it
depends
on
you
whether
the
professor
is
to
be
restored
or
not
and
there
nothing
alarming
about
old
fakrash
either
i
got
him
to
put
on
ordinary
things
and
he
really
does
look
so
bad
in
them
he
quite
a
mild
amiable
old
noodle
and
he
do
anything
for
you
if
you
only
stroke
him
down
the
right
way
you
see
him
wo
you
for
your
sake
if
i
must
said
sylvia
with
a
shudder
i
i
be
as
nice
to
him
as
i
can
horace
went
to
the
window
and
gave
the
signal
though
there
was
no
one
in
sight
however
it
was
evidently
seen
for
the
next
moment
there
was
a
resounding
blow
at
the
front
door
and
a
little
later
jessie
the
announced
fatrasher
larmash
to
see
ventimore
and
the
jinnee
stalked
gravely
in
with
his
tall
hat
on
his
head
you
are
probably
not
aware
of
it
sir
said
horace
but
it
is
the
custom
here
to
uncover
in
the
presence
of
a
lady
the
jinnee
removed
his
hat
with
both
hands
and
stood
silent
and
impassive
let
me
present
you
to
miss
sylvia
futvoye
ventimore
continued
the
lady
whose
name
you
have
already
heard
there
was
a
momentary
gleam
in
fakrash
odd
slanting
eyes
as
they
lighted
on
sylvia
shrinking
figure
but
he
made
no
acknowledgment
of
the
introduction
the
damsel
is
not
without
comeliness
he
remarked
to
horace
but
there
are
lovelier
far
than
she
i
did
ask
you
for
either
criticisms
or
comparisons
said
ventimore
sharply
there
is
nobody
in
the
world
equal
to
miss
futvoye
in
my
opinion
and
you
will
be
good
enough
to
remember
that
fact
she
is
exceedingly
distressed
as
any
dutiful
daughter
would
be
by
the
cruel
and
senseless
trick
you
have
played
her
father
and
she
begs
that
you
will
rectify
it
at
once
do
you
sylvia
yes
indeed
said
sylvia
almost
in
a
whisper
if
if
it
troubling
you
too
much
i
have
been
turning
over
thy
words
in
my
mind
said
fakrash
to
horace
still
ignoring
sylvia
and
i
am
convinced
that
thou
art
right
even
if
the
contents
of
the
seal
were
known
of
all
men
they
would
raise
no
clamour
about
affairs
that
concern
them
not
therefore
it
is
nothing
to
me
in
whose
hands
the
seal
may
be
dost
thou
not
agree
with
me
in
this
of
course
i
do
said
horace
and
it
naturally
follows
that
it
naturally
follows
as
thou
sayest
said
the
jinnee
with
a
cunning
assumption
of
indifference
that
i
have
naught
to
gain
by
demanding
back
the
seal
as
the
price
of
restoring
this
damsel
father
to
his
original
form
wherefore
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
let
him
remain
a
mule
for
ever
unless
indeed
thou
art
ready
to
comply
with
my
conditions
conditions
cried
horace
utterly
unprepared
for
this
conclusion
what
can
you
possibly
want
from
me
but
state
them
i
agree
to
anything
in
reason
i
demand
that
thou
shouldst
renounce
the
hand
of
this
damsel
that
out
of
all
reason
said
horace
and
you
know
it
i
will
never
give
her
up
so
long
as
she
is
willing
to
keep
me
maiden
said
the
jinnee
addressing
sylvia
for
the
first
time
the
matter
rests
with
thee
wilt
thou
release
this
my
son
from
his
contract
since
thou
art
no
fit
wife
for
such
as
he
how
can
i
cried
sylvia
when
i
love
him
and
he
loves
me
what
a
wicked
tyrannical
old
thing
you
must
be
to
expect
it
i
give
him
up
it
is
but
giving
up
what
can
never
be
thine
said
fakrash
and
be
not
anxious
for
him
for
i
will
reward
and
console
him
a
thousandfold
for
the
loss
of
thy
society
a
little
while
and
he
shall
remember
thee
no
more
do
believe
him
darling
said
horace
you
know
me
better
than
that
remember
said
the
jinnee
that
by
thy
refusal
thou
wilt
condemn
thy
parent
to
remain
a
mule
throughout
all
his
days
art
thou
so
unnatural
and
a
daughter
as
to
do
this
thing
oh
i
could
cried
sylvia
i
ca
let
poor
father
remain
a
mule
all
his
life
when
one
word
and
yet
what
i
to
do
horace
what
shall
i
say
advise
me
advise
me
heaven
help
us
both
groaned
ventimore
if
i
could
only
see
the
right
thing
to
do
look
here
fakrash
he
added
this
is
a
matter
that
requires
consideration
will
you
relieve
us
of
your
presence
for
a
short
time
while
we
talk
it
over
with
all
my
heart
said
the
jinnee
in
the
most
obliging
manner
in
the
world
and
vanished
instantly
now
darling
began
horace
after
he
had
gone
if
that
unspeakable
old
scoundrel
is
really
in
earnest
there
no
denying
that
he
got
us
in
an
extremely
tight
place
but
i
ca
bring
myself
to
believe
that
he
mean
it
i
fancy
he
only
trying
us
and
what
i
want
you
to
do
is
not
to
consider
me
in
the
matter
at
all
how
can
i
help
it
said
poor
sylvia
horace
you
you
do
to
be
released
do
you
i
said
horace
when
you
are
all
i
have
in
the
world
that
so
likely
sylvia
but
we
are
bound
to
look
facts
in
the
face
to
begin
with
even
if
this
had
happened
your
people
would
let
our
engagement
continue
for
my
prospects
have
changed
again
dearest
even
worse
off
than
when
we
first
met
for
that
confounded
jinnee
has
contrived
to
lose
my
first
and
only
client
for
me
the
one
thing
worth
having
he
ever
gave
me
and
he
told
her
the
story
of
the
mushroom
palace
and
wackerbath
withdrawal
so
you
see
darling
he
concluded
i
have
even
a
home
to
offer
you
and
if
i
had
it
would
be
miserably
uncomfortable
for
you
with
that
old
marplot
continually
dropping
in
on
us
especially
if
as
i
afraid
he
has
he
taken
some
unreasonable
dislike
to
you
but
surely
you
can
talk
him
over
said
sylvia
you
said
you
could
do
anything
you
liked
with
him
i
beginning
to
find
he
replied
ruefully
enough
that
he
not
so
easily
managed
as
i
thought
and
for
the
present
i
afraid
if
we
are
to
get
the
professor
out
of
this
that
there
nothing
for
it
but
to
humour
old
fakrash
then
you
actually
advise
me
to
to
break
it
off
she
cried
i
never
thought
you
would
do
that
for
your
own
sake
said
horace
for
your
father
sake
if
wo
sylvia
i
and
you
will
spare
me
that
let
us
both
agree
to
part
and
and
trust
that
we
shall
be
united
some
day
do
try
to
deceive
me
or
yourself
horace
she
said
if
we
part
now
it
will
be
for
ever
he
had
a
dismal
conviction
that
she
was
right
we
must
hope
for
the
best
he
said
drearily
fakrash
may
have
some
motive
in
all
this
we
do
understand
or
he
may
relent
but
part
we
must
for
the
present
very
well
she
said
if
he
restores
dad
i
will
give
you
up
but
not
unless
hath
the
damsel
decided
asked
the
jinnee
suddenly
for
the
period
of
deliberation
is
past
miss
futvoye
and
i
horace
answered
for
her
are
willing
to
consider
our
engagement
at
an
end
until
you
approve
of
its
renewal
on
condition
that
you
restore
her
father
at
once
agreed
said
fakrash
conduct
me
to
him
and
we
will
arrange
the
matter
without
delay
outside
they
met
futvoye
on
her
way
from
the
study
you
here
horace
she
exclaimed
and
who
is
this
gentleman
this
said
horace
is
the
er
author
of
the
professor
misfortunes
and
he
had
come
here
at
my
request
to
undo
his
work
it
be
so
kind
of
him
exclaimed
the
distressed
lady
who
was
by
this
time
far
beyond
either
surprise
or
resentment
i
sure
if
he
knew
all
we
have
gone
through
and
she
led
the
way
to
her
room
as
soon
as
the
door
was
opened
the
professor
seemed
to
recognise
his
tormentor
in
spite
of
his
changed
raiment
and
was
so
powerfully
agitated
that
he
actually
reeled
on
his
four
legs
and
stood
over
in
a
lamentable
fashion
o
man
of
distinguished
attainments
began
the
jinnee
whom
i
have
caused
for
reasons
that
are
known
unto
thee
to
assume
the
shape
of
a
mule
speak
i
adjure
thee
and
tell
me
where
thou
hast
deposited
the
inscribed
seal
which
is
in
thy
possession
the
professor
spoke
and
the
effect
of
articulate
speech
proceeding
from
the
mouth
of
what
was
to
all
outward
seeming
an
ordinary
mule
was
strange
beyond
description
i
see
you
damned
first
he
said
sullenly
you
ca
do
worse
to
me
than
you
done
already
as
thou
wilt
said
fakrash
but
unless
i
regain
it
i
will
not
restore
thee
to
what
thou
wast
well
then
said
the
mule
savagely
you
find
it
in
the
top
drawer
of
my
the
key
is
in
that
diorite
bowl
on
the
mantelpiece
the
jinnee
unlocked
the
drawer
and
took
out
the
metal
cap
which
he
placed
in
the
breast
pocket
of
his
incongruous
so
far
well
he
said
next
thou
must
deliver
up
to
me
the
transcription
thou
hast
made
and
swear
to
preserve
an
inviolable
secrecy
regarding
the
meaning
thereof
do
you
know
what
you
asking
sir
said
the
mule
laying
back
his
ears
viciously
do
you
think
that
to
oblige
you
i
going
to
suppress
one
of
the
most
remarkable
discoveries
of
my
whole
scientific
career
never
sir
never
since
if
thou
refusest
i
shall
assuredly
deprive
thee
of
speech
once
more
and
leave
thee
a
mule
as
thou
art
now
of
hideous
appearance
said
the
jinnee
thou
art
like
to
gain
little
by
a
discovery
which
thou
wilt
be
unable
to
impart
however
the
choice
rests
with
thee
the
mule
rolled
his
one
eye
and
showed
all
his
teeth
in
a
vicious
snarl
you
got
the
of
me
he
said
and
i
may
as
well
give
in
there
a
transcript
inside
my
it
the
only
copy
i
made
fakrash
found
the
paper
which
he
rubbed
into
invisibility
between
his
palms
as
any
ordinary
conjurer
might
do
now
raise
thy
right
forefoot
he
said
and
swear
by
all
thou
holdest
sacred
never
to
divulge
what
thou
hast
learnt
which
oath
the
professor
in
the
vilest
of
tempers
took
clumsily
enough
good
said
the
jinnee
with
a
grim
smile
now
let
one
of
thy
women
bring
me
a
cup
of
fair
water
sylvia
went
out
and
came
back
with
a
cup
of
water
it
filtered
she
said
anxiously
i
do
know
if
that
will
do
it
will
suffice
said
fakrash
let
both
the
women
withdraw
surely
remonstrated
futvoye
you
do
mean
to
turn
his
wife
and
daughter
out
of
the
room
at
such
a
moment
as
this
we
shall
be
perfectly
quiet
and
we
may
even
be
of
some
help
do
as
you
told
my
dear
snapped
the
ungrateful
mule
do
as
told
you
only
be
in
the
way
here
do
you
suppose
he
does
know
his
own
beastly
business
they
left
accordingly
whereupon
fakrash
took
the
cup
an
ordinary
breakfast
cup
with
a
greek
pattern
in
pale
blue
round
the
top
and
drenching
the
mule
with
the
contents
exclaimed
quit
this
form
and
return
to
the
form
in
which
thou
wast
for
a
dreadful
moment
or
two
it
seemed
as
if
no
effect
was
to
be
produced
the
animal
simply
stood
and
shivered
and
ventimore
began
to
feel
an
agonising
suspicion
that
the
jinnee
really
had
as
he
had
first
asserted
forgotten
how
to
perform
this
particular
incantation
all
at
once
the
mule
reared
and
began
to
beat
the
air
frantically
with
his
after
which
he
fell
heavily
backward
into
the
nearest
armchair
which
was
fortunately
a
solid
and
capacious
piece
of
furniture
with
his
hanging
limply
at
his
side
in
a
fashion
there
was
a
brief
convulsion
and
then
by
some
gradual
process
unspeakably
impressive
to
witness
the
man
seemed
to
break
through
the
mule
the
mule
became
merged
in
the
man
and
professor
futvoye
restored
to
his
own
natural
form
and
habit
sat
gasping
and
trembling
in
the
chair
before
them
chapter
xiv
since
there
no
help
come
let
us
kiss
and
part
as
soon
as
the
professor
seemed
to
have
regained
his
faculties
horace
opened
the
door
and
called
in
sylvia
and
her
mother
who
were
as
was
only
to
be
expected
overcome
with
joy
on
seeing
the
head
of
the
family
released
from
his
ignoble
condition
of
a
singularly
quadruped
there
there
said
the
professor
as
he
submitted
to
their
embraces
and
incoherent
congratulations
it
nothing
to
make
a
fuss
about
quite
myself
again
as
you
can
see
and
he
added
with
an
unreasonable
outburst
of
if
one
of
you
had
only
had
the
common
sense
to
think
of
such
a
simple
remedy
as
sprinkling
a
little
cold
water
over
me
when
i
was
first
taken
like
that
i
should
have
been
spared
a
great
deal
of
unnecessary
inconvenience
but
that
always
the
way
with
women
lose
their
heads
the
moment
anything
goes
wrong
if
i
had
not
kept
perfectly
cool
myself
it
was
very
very
stupid
of
us
not
to
think
of
it
papa
said
sylvia
tactfully
ignoring
the
fact
that
there
was
scarcely
an
undamaged
article
in
the
room
still
you
know
if
had
thrown
the
water
it
have
had
the
same
effect
i
not
in
a
condition
to
argue
now
said
her
father
you
trouble
to
try
it
and
there
no
more
to
be
said
no
more
to
be
said
exclaimed
fakrash
o
thou
monster
of
ingratitude
hast
thou
no
thanks
for
him
who
hath
delivered
thee
from
thy
predicament
as
i
am
already
indebted
to
you
sir
said
the
professor
for
about
hours
of
the
most
poignant
and
humiliating
mental
and
bodily
anguish
a
human
being
can
endure
inflicted
for
no
valid
reason
that
i
can
discover
except
the
wanton
indulgence
of
your
unholy
powers
i
can
only
say
that
any
gratitude
of
which
i
am
conscious
is
of
a
very
qualified
description
as
for
you
ventimore
he
added
turning
to
horace
i
do
know
i
can
only
guess
at
the
part
you
have
played
in
this
wretched
business
but
in
any
case
you
will
understand
once
for
all
that
all
relations
between
us
must
cease
papa
said
sylvia
tremulously
horace
and
i
have
already
agreed
that
that
we
must
separate
at
my
bidding
explained
fakrash
suavely
for
such
an
alliance
would
be
totally
unworthy
of
his
merits
and
condition
this
frankness
was
rather
too
much
for
the
professor
whose
temper
had
not
been
improved
by
his
recent
trials
nobody
asked
for
your
opinion
sir
he
snapped
a
person
who
has
only
recently
been
released
from
a
term
of
long
and
from
all
i
have
been
able
to
ascertain
imprisonment
is
scarcely
entitled
to
pose
as
an
authority
on
social
rank
have
the
decency
not
to
interfere
again
with
my
domestic
affairs
excellent
is
the
saying
remarked
the
imperturbable
jinnee
the
rat
that
is
between
the
paws
of
the
leopard
observe
rigidly
all
the
rules
of
politeness
and
refrain
from
words
of
provocation
for
to
return
thee
to
the
form
of
a
mule
once
more
would
be
no
difficult
undertaking
i
think
i
failed
to
make
myself
clear
the
professor
hastened
to
observe
failed
to
make
myself
clear
i
i
merely
meant
to
congratulate
you
on
your
fortunate
escape
from
the
consequences
of
what
i
i
doubt
was
an
error
of
justice
i
i
am
sure
that
in
the
future
you
will
employ
your
your
very
remarkable
abilities
to
better
purpose
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
greatest
service
you
can
do
this
unfortunate
young
man
here
is
to
abstain
from
any
further
attempts
to
promote
his
interests
hear
hear
horace
could
not
help
throwing
in
though
in
so
discreet
an
undertone
that
it
was
inaudible
far
be
this
from
me
replied
fakrash
for
he
has
become
unto
me
even
as
a
favourite
son
whom
i
design
to
place
upon
the
golden
pinnacle
of
felicity
therefore
i
have
chosen
for
him
a
wife
who
is
unto
this
damsel
of
thine
as
the
full
moon
to
the
and
as
the
bird
of
paradise
to
an
unfledged
sparrow
and
the
nuptials
shall
be
celebrated
before
many
hours
horace
cried
sylvia
justly
incensed
why
did
you
tell
me
this
before
because
said
the
unhappy
horace
this
is
the
very
first
i
heard
of
it
he
always
springing
some
fresh
surprise
on
me
he
added
in
a
whisper
but
they
never
come
to
anything
much
and
he
ca
marry
me
against
my
will
you
know
no
said
sylvia
biting
her
lip
i
never
supposed
he
could
do
that
horace
i
settle
this
at
once
he
replied
now
look
here
jinnee
he
added
i
do
know
what
new
scheme
you
have
got
in
your
head
but
if
you
are
proposing
to
marry
me
to
anybody
in
particular
have
i
not
informed
thee
that
i
have
it
in
contemplation
to
obtain
for
thee
the
hand
of
a
king
daughter
of
marvellous
beauty
and
accomplishments
you
know
perfectly
well
you
never
mentioned
it
before
said
horace
while
sylvia
gave
a
little
low
cry
repine
not
o
damsel
counselled
the
jinnee
since
it
is
for
his
welfare
for
though
as
yet
he
believeth
it
not
when
he
beholds
the
resplendent
beauty
of
her
countenance
he
will
swoon
away
with
delight
and
forget
thy
very
existence
i
shall
do
nothing
of
the
sort
said
horace
savagely
just
understand
that
i
do
intend
to
marry
any
princess
you
may
prevent
me
in
fact
you
from
marrying
this
lady
but
you
ca
force
me
to
marry
anybody
else
i
defy
you
when
thou
hast
seen
thy
bride
perfections
thou
wilt
need
no
compulsion
said
fakrash
and
if
thou
shouldst
refuse
know
this
that
thou
wilt
be
exposing
those
who
are
dear
to
thee
in
this
household
to
calamities
of
the
most
unfortunate
description
the
awful
vagueness
of
this
threat
completely
crushed
horace
he
could
not
think
he
did
not
even
dare
to
imagine
what
consequences
he
might
bring
upon
his
beloved
sylvia
and
her
helpless
parents
by
persisting
in
his
refusal
give
me
time
he
said
heavily
i
want
to
talk
this
over
with
you
pardon
me
ventimore
said
the
professor
with
acidulous
politeness
but
interesting
as
the
discussion
of
your
matrimonial
arrangements
is
to
you
and
your
a
protector
i
should
greatly
prefer
that
you
choose
some
more
fitting
place
for
arriving
at
a
decision
which
is
in
the
circumstances
a
foregone
conclusion
i
am
rather
tired
and
upset
and
i
should
be
obliged
if
you
and
this
gentleman
could
bring
this
most
trying
interview
to
a
close
as
soon
as
you
conveniently
can
you
hear
mr
fakrash
said
horace
between
his
teeth
it
is
quite
time
we
left
if
you
go
at
once
i
will
follow
you
very
shortly
thou
wilt
find
me
awaiting
thee
answered
the
jinnee
and
to
futvoye
and
sylvia
alarm
disappeared
through
one
of
the
bookcases
well
said
horace
gloomily
you
see
how
i
situated
that
obstinate
old
devil
has
cornered
me
i
done
for
do
say
that
said
the
professor
you
appear
to
be
on
the
eve
of
a
most
brilliant
alliance
in
which
i
am
sure
you
have
our
best
wishes
the
best
wishes
of
us
all
he
added
pointedly
sylvia
said
horace
still
lingering
before
i
go
tell
me
that
whatever
i
may
have
to
do
you
will
understand
that
that
it
will
be
for
your
sake
please
do
talk
like
that
she
said
we
may
never
see
one
another
again
do
let
my
last
recollection
of
you
be
of
of
a
hypocrite
horace
a
hypocrite
he
cried
sylvia
this
is
too
much
what
have
i
said
or
done
to
make
you
think
me
that
oh
i
am
not
so
simple
as
you
suppose
horace
she
replied
i
see
now
why
all
this
has
happened
why
poor
dad
was
tormented
why
you
insisted
on
my
setting
you
free
but
i
would
have
released
you
without
indeed
all
this
elaborate
artifice
was
in
the
least
necessary
you
believe
i
was
an
accomplice
in
that
old
fool
plot
he
said
you
believe
me
such
a
cur
as
that
i
do
blame
you
she
said
i
do
believe
you
could
help
yourself
he
can
make
you
do
whatever
he
chooses
and
then
you
are
so
rich
now
it
is
natural
that
you
should
want
to
marry
some
one
some
one
more
suited
to
you
like
this
lovely
princess
of
yours
of
mine
groaned
the
exasperated
horace
when
i
tell
you
i
never
even
seen
her
as
if
any
princess
in
the
world
would
marry
me
to
please
a
jinnee
out
of
a
brass
bottle
and
if
she
did
sylvia
you
believe
that
any
princess
would
make
me
forget
you
it
depends
so
very
much
on
the
princess
was
all
sylvia
could
be
induced
to
say
well
said
horace
if
that
all
the
faith
you
have
in
me
i
suppose
it
useless
to
say
any
more
futvoye
professor
i
wish
i
could
tell
you
how
deeply
i
regret
all
the
trouble
i
have
brought
on
you
by
my
own
folly
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
will
bear
anything
in
future
rather
than
expose
you
or
any
of
you
to
the
smallest
risk
i
trust
indeed
said
the
professor
stiffly
that
you
will
use
all
the
influence
at
your
command
to
secure
me
from
any
repetition
of
an
experience
that
might
well
have
unmanned
a
less
equable
temperament
than
my
own
horace
said
futvoye
more
kindly
i
believe
you
are
more
to
be
pitied
than
blamed
whatever
others
may
think
and
forget
if
anthony
does
that
but
for
you
he
might
instead
of
sitting
there
comfortably
in
his
armchair
be
lashing
out
with
his
hind
legs
and
kicking
everything
to
pieces
at
this
very
moment
i
deny
that
i
lashed
out
said
the
professor
my
a
hind
quarters
may
have
been
under
imperfect
control
but
i
never
lost
my
reasoning
powers
or
my
good
humour
for
a
single
instant
i
can
say
that
truthfully
if
the
professor
could
say
that
truthfully
amidst
the
general
wreck
in
which
he
sat
like
another
marius
he
had
little
to
learn
in
the
gentle
art
of
but
there
was
nothing
to
gain
by
contradicting
him
then
sylvia
said
horace
and
held
out
his
hand
she
said
without
offering
to
take
it
or
look
at
him
and
after
a
miserable
pause
he
left
the
study
but
before
he
had
reached
the
front
door
he
heard
a
swish
and
swirl
of
drapery
behind
him
and
felt
her
light
hand
on
his
arm
ah
no
she
said
clinging
to
him
i
ca
let
you
go
like
this
i
did
mean
all
the
things
i
said
just
now
i
believe
in
you
horace
at
least
i
try
hard
to
and
i
shall
always
love
you
horace
i
sha
care
very
much
even
if
you
do
forget
me
so
long
as
you
are
happy
only
be
happy
think
of
me
sometimes
i
shall
be
too
happy
he
said
as
he
held
her
close
to
his
heart
and
kissed
her
pathetically
drawn
mouth
and
flushed
cheeks
and
i
shall
think
of
you
always
and
you
wo
fall
in
love
with
your
princess
entreated
sylvia
at
the
end
of
her
altruism
promise
if
i
am
ever
provided
with
one
he
replied
i
shall
loathe
her
for
not
being
you
but
do
let
us
lose
heart
darling
there
must
be
some
way
of
talking
that
old
idiot
out
of
this
nonsense
and
bringing
him
round
to
common
sense
i
not
going
to
give
in
just
yet
these
were
brave
words
but
as
they
both
felt
the
situation
had
little
enough
to
warrant
them
and
after
one
last
long
embrace
they
parted
and
he
was
no
sooner
on
the
steps
than
he
felt
himself
caught
up
as
before
and
borne
through
the
air
with
breathless
speed
till
he
was
set
down
he
could
not
have
well
said
how
in
a
chair
in
his
own
at
vincent
square
well
he
said
looking
at
the
jinnee
who
was
standing
opposite
with
a
smile
of
intolerable
complacency
i
suppose
you
feel
satisfied
with
yourself
over
this
business
it
hath
indeed
been
brought
to
a
favourable
conclusion
said
fakrash
well
hath
the
poet
written
i
do
think
i
can
stand
any
more
extracts
this
afternoon
interrupted
horace
let
us
come
to
business
you
seem
he
went
on
with
a
strong
effort
to
keep
himself
in
hand
to
have
formed
some
plan
for
marrying
me
to
a
king
daughter
may
i
ask
you
for
full
particulars
no
honour
and
advancement
can
be
in
excess
of
thy
deserts
answered
the
jinnee
very
kind
of
you
to
say
so
but
you
are
probably
unaware
that
as
society
is
constituted
at
the
present
time
the
objections
to
such
an
alliance
would
be
quite
insuperable
for
me
said
the
jinnee
few
obstacles
are
insuperable
but
speak
thy
mind
freely
i
will
said
horace
to
begin
with
no
european
princess
of
the
blood
royal
would
entertain
the
idea
for
a
moment
and
if
she
did
she
would
forfeit
her
rank
and
cease
to
be
a
princess
and
i
should
probably
be
imprisoned
in
a
fortress
for
or
something
dismiss
thy
fears
for
i
do
not
propose
to
unite
thee
to
any
princess
that
is
born
of
mortals
the
bride
i
intend
for
thee
is
a
jinneeyeh
the
peerless
daughter
of
my
kinsman
shahyal
the
ruler
of
the
blue
jann
oh
is
she
though
said
horace
blankly
i
exceedingly
obliged
but
whatever
may
be
the
lady
attractions
her
nose
recited
the
jinnee
with
enthusiasm
is
like
unto
the
keen
edge
of
a
polished
sword
her
hair
resembleth
jewels
and
her
cheeks
are
ruddy
as
wine
she
hath
heavy
lips
and
when
she
looketh
aside
she
putteth
to
shame
the
wild
cows
my
good
excellent
friend
said
horace
by
no
means
impressed
by
this
catalogue
of
charms
one
does
marry
to
mortify
wild
cows
when
she
walketh
with
a
vacillating
gait
continued
fakrash
as
though
he
had
not
been
interrupted
the
willow
branch
itself
turneth
green
with
envy
personally
said
horace
a
waddle
does
strike
me
as
particularly
fascinating
it
quite
a
matter
of
taste
do
you
happen
to
have
seen
this
enchantress
lately
my
eyes
have
not
been
refreshed
by
her
manifold
beauties
since
i
was
enclosed
by
suleyman
whose
name
be
accursed
in
the
brass
bottle
of
which
thou
knowest
why
dost
thou
ask
merely
because
it
occurred
to
me
that
after
very
nearly
three
thousand
years
your
charming
kinswoman
may
well
to
put
it
as
mildly
as
possible
not
have
altogether
escaped
the
usual
effects
of
time
i
mean
she
must
be
getting
on
you
know
o
one
said
the
jinnee
in
rebuke
art
thou
then
ignorant
that
we
of
the
jinn
are
not
as
mortals
that
we
should
feel
the
ravages
of
age
forgive
me
if
i
personal
said
horace
but
surely
your
own
hair
and
beard
might
be
described
as
rather
inclining
to
grey
not
from
age
said
fakrash
this
cometh
from
long
confinement
i
see
said
horace
like
the
prisoner
of
chillon
well
assuming
that
the
lady
in
question
is
still
in
the
bloom
of
early
youth
i
see
one
fatal
difficulty
to
becoming
her
suitor
doubtless
said
the
jinnee
thou
art
referring
to
jarjarees
the
son
of
rejmoos
the
son
of
iblees
no
i
was
said
horace
because
you
see
i
do
remember
having
ever
heard
of
him
however
he
fatal
difficulty
that
makes
two
of
them
surely
i
have
spoken
of
him
to
thee
as
my
deadliest
foe
it
is
true
that
he
is
a
powerful
and
vindictive
efreet
who
hath
long
persecuted
the
beauteous
bedeea
with
hateful
attentions
yet
it
may
be
possible
by
good
fortune
to
overthrow
him
then
i
gather
that
any
suitor
for
bedeea
hand
would
be
looked
upon
as
a
rival
by
the
amiable
jarjarees
far
is
he
from
being
of
an
amiable
disposition
answered
the
jinnee
simply
and
he
would
be
so
transported
by
rage
and
jealousy
that
he
would
certainly
challenge
thee
to
mortal
combat
then
that
settles
it
said
horace
i
do
think
any
one
can
fairly
call
me
a
coward
but
i
do
draw
the
line
at
fighting
an
efreet
for
the
hand
of
a
lady
i
never
seen
how
do
i
know
he
fight
fair
he
would
probably
appear
unto
thee
first
in
the
form
of
a
lion
and
if
he
could
not
thus
prevail
against
thee
transform
himself
into
a
serpent
and
then
into
a
buffalo
or
some
other
wild
beast
and
i
should
have
to
tackle
the
entire
menagerie
said
horace
why
my
dear
sir
i
should
never
get
beyond
the
lion
i
would
assist
thee
to
assume
similar
transformations
said
the
jinnee
and
thus
thou
mayst
be
enabled
to
defeat
him
for
i
burn
with
desire
to
behold
mine
enemy
reduced
to
cinders
it
much
more
likely
that
you
would
have
to
sweep
up
said
horace
who
had
a
strong
conviction
that
anything
in
which
the
jinnee
was
concerned
would
be
bungled
somehow
and
if
you
so
anxious
to
destroy
this
jarjarees
why
do
you
challenge
him
to
meet
you
in
some
quiet
place
in
the
desert
and
settle
him
yourself
it
much
more
in
your
line
than
it
is
in
mine
he
was
not
without
hopes
that
fakrash
might
act
on
this
suggestion
and
that
so
he
would
be
relieved
of
him
in
the
simplest
and
most
satisfactory
way
but
any
such
hopes
were
as
usual
doomed
to
disappointment
it
would
be
of
no
avail
said
the
jinnee
for
it
hath
been
written
of
old
that
jarjarees
shall
not
perish
save
by
the
hand
of
a
mortal
and
i
am
persuaded
that
thou
wilt
turn
out
to
be
that
mortal
since
thou
art
both
strong
and
fearless
and
moreover
it
is
also
predestined
that
bedeea
shall
wed
one
of
the
sons
of
men
then
said
horace
feeling
that
this
line
of
defence
must
be
abandoned
i
fall
back
on
objection
number
one
even
if
jarjarees
were
obliging
enough
to
retire
in
my
favour
i
should
still
decline
to
become
the
a
consort
of
a
jinneeyeh
whom
i
never
seen
and
do
love
thou
hast
heard
of
her
incomparable
charms
and
verily
the
ear
may
love
before
the
eye
it
may
admitted
horace
but
neither
of
ears
is
the
least
in
love
at
present
these
reasons
are
of
no
value
said
fakrash
and
if
thou
hast
none
better
well
said
ventimore
i
think
i
have
you
profess
to
be
anxious
to
to
requite
the
trifling
service
i
rendered
you
though
hitherto
you
admit
yourself
you
have
made
a
very
brilliant
success
of
it
but
putting
the
past
aside
he
continued
with
a
sudden
dryness
in
his
throat
putting
the
past
aside
i
ask
you
to
consider
what
possible
benefit
or
happiness
such
a
match
as
this
i
afraid
i
not
so
fortunate
as
to
secure
your
attention
he
broke
off
as
he
observed
the
jinnee
eyes
beginning
to
film
over
in
the
disagreeable
manner
characteristic
of
certain
birds
proceed
said
fakrash
unskinning
his
eyes
for
a
second
i
am
hearkening
unto
thee
it
seems
to
me
stammered
horace
inconsequently
enough
that
all
that
time
inside
a
bottle
well
you
ca
call
it
exactly
and
possibly
in
the
interval
you
forgotten
all
you
knew
about
feminine
nature
i
think
you
have
it
is
not
possible
that
such
knowledge
should
be
forgotten
said
the
jinnee
resenting
this
imputation
in
quite
a
human
way
thy
words
appear
to
me
to
lack
sense
interpret
them
i
pray
thee
why
explained
horace
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
that
this
young
and
lovely
relation
of
yours
a
kind
of
immortal
and
and
with
the
own
pride
would
be
gratified
by
your
proposal
to
bestow
her
hand
upon
an
insignificant
and
unsuccessful
london
architect
she
turn
up
that
sharp
and
polished
nose
of
hers
at
the
mere
idea
of
so
unequal
a
match
an
excellent
rank
is
that
conferred
by
wealth
remarked
the
jinnee
but
i
rich
and
i
already
declined
any
riches
from
you
said
horace
and
what
more
to
the
point
i
perfectly
and
hopelessly
obscure
if
you
had
the
slightest
sense
of
humour
which
i
fear
you
have
not
you
would
at
once
perceive
the
absurdity
of
proposing
to
unite
a
radiant
ethereal
superhuman
being
to
a
commonplace
professional
nonentity
in
a
morning
coat
and
a
tall
hat
it
really
too
ridiculous
what
thou
hast
just
said
is
not
altogether
without
wisdom
said
fakrash
to
whom
this
was
evidently
a
new
point
of
view
art
thou
indeed
so
utterly
unknown
unknown
repeated
horace
i
should
rather
think
i
was
i
simply
an
inconsiderable
unit
in
the
population
of
the
vastest
city
in
the
world
or
rather
not
a
unit
a
cipher
and
do
you
see
a
man
to
be
worthy
of
your
exalted
kinswoman
ought
to
be
a
celebrity
there
are
plenty
of
them
about
what
meanest
thou
by
a
celebrity
inquired
fakrash
falling
into
the
trap
more
readily
than
horace
had
ventured
to
hope
oh
well
a
distinguished
person
whose
name
is
on
everybody
lips
who
is
honoured
and
praised
by
all
his
now
kind
of
man
no
jinneeyeh
could
look
down
upon
i
perceive
said
fakrash
thoughtfully
yes
i
was
in
danger
of
committing
a
rash
action
how
do
men
honour
such
distinguished
individuals
in
these
days
they
generally
overfeed
them
said
horace
in
london
the
highest
honour
a
hero
can
be
paid
is
to
receive
the
freedom
of
the
city
which
is
only
conferred
in
very
exceptional
cases
and
for
some
notable
service
but
of
course
there
are
other
sorts
of
celebrities
as
you
could
see
if
you
glanced
through
the
society
papers
i
can
not
believe
that
thou
who
seemest
a
gracious
and
talented
young
man
can
be
indeed
so
obscure
as
thou
hast
represented
my
good
sir
any
of
the
flowers
that
blush
unseen
in
the
desert
air
or
the
gems
concealed
in
ocean
caves
so
excellently
described
by
one
of
our
poets
could
give
me
points
and
a
beating
in
the
matter
of
notoriety
i
make
you
a
sporting
offer
there
are
over
five
million
inhabitants
in
this
london
of
ours
if
you
go
out
into
the
streets
and
ask
the
first
five
hundred
you
meet
whether
they
know
me
i
do
mind
betting
you
what
shall
i
say
a
new
hat
that
you
wo
find
half
a
dozen
who
ever
even
heard
of
my
existence
why
not
go
out
and
see
for
yourself
to
his
surprise
and
gratification
the
jinnee
took
this
seriously
i
will
go
forth
and
make
inquiry
he
said
for
i
desire
further
enlightenment
concerning
thy
statements
but
remember
he
added
should
i
still
require
thee
to
wed
the
matchless
and
thou
shouldst
disobey
me
thou
wilt
bring
disaster
not
on
thine
own
head
but
on
those
thou
art
most
desirous
of
protecting
yes
so
you
told
me
before
said
horace
brusquely
good
evening
but
fakrash
was
already
gone
in
spite
of
all
he
had
gone
through
and
the
unknown
difficulties
before
him
ventimore
was
seized
with
what
uncle
remus
calls
a
spell
of
the
dry
grins
at
the
thought
of
the
probable
replies
that
the
jinnee
would
meet
with
in
the
course
of
his
inquiries
i
afraid
he
wo
be
particularly
impressed
by
the
politeness
of
a
london
crowd
he
thought
but
at
least
convince
him
that
i
am
not
exactly
a
prominent
citizen
then
he
give
up
this
idiotic
match
of
his
i
do
know
though
he
such
a
old
fool
that
he
may
stick
to
it
all
the
same
i
may
find
myself
encumbered
with
a
jinneeyeh
bride
several
centuries
my
senior
before
i
know
where
i
am
no
i
forget
there
the
jealous
jarjarees
to
be
polished
off
first
i
seem
to
remember
something
about
a
combat
with
an
efreet
in
the
arabian
nights
i
may
as
well
look
it
up
and
see
what
may
be
in
store
for
me
and
after
dinner
he
went
to
his
shelves
and
took
down
edition
of
the
arabian
nights
which
he
set
himself
to
study
with
a
new
interest
it
was
long
since
he
had
looked
into
these
wondrous
tales
old
beyond
all
human
calculation
and
fresher
even
now
than
the
most
modern
of
successful
romances
after
all
he
was
tempted
to
think
they
might
possess
quite
as
much
historical
value
as
many
works
with
graver
pretentions
to
accuracy
he
found
a
full
account
of
the
combat
with
the
efreet
in
the
story
of
the
second
royal
mendicant
in
the
first
volume
and
was
unpleasantly
surprised
to
discover
that
the
efreet
name
was
actually
given
as
jarjarees
the
son
of
rejmoos
the
son
of
iblees
evidently
the
same
person
to
whom
fakrash
had
referred
as
his
bitterest
foe
he
was
described
as
of
hideous
aspect
and
had
it
seemed
not
only
carried
off
the
daughter
of
the
lord
of
the
ebony
island
on
her
wedding
night
but
on
discovering
her
in
the
society
of
the
royal
mendicant
had
revenged
himself
by
striking
off
her
hands
her
feet
and
her
head
and
transforming
his
human
rival
into
an
ape
between
this
fellow
and
old
fakrash
he
reflected
ruefully
at
this
point
i
seem
likely
to
have
a
fairly
lively
time
of
it
he
read
on
till
he
reached
the
memorable
encounter
between
the
daughter
and
jarjarees
who
presented
himself
in
a
most
hideous
shape
with
hands
like
winnowing
forks
and
legs
like
masts
and
eyes
like
burning
torches
which
was
calculated
to
unnerve
the
stoutest
novice
the
efreet
began
by
transforming
himself
from
a
lion
to
a
scorpion
upon
which
the
princess
became
a
serpent
then
he
changed
to
an
eagle
and
she
to
a
vulture
he
to
a
black
cat
and
she
to
a
cock
he
to
a
fish
and
she
to
a
larger
fish
still
if
fakrash
can
shove
me
through
all
that
without
a
fatal
hitch
somewhere
ventimore
told
himself
i
shall
be
agreeably
disappointed
in
him
but
after
reading
a
few
more
lines
he
cheered
up
for
the
efreet
finished
as
a
flame
and
the
princess
as
a
body
of
fire
and
when
we
looked
towards
him
continued
the
narrator
we
perceived
that
he
had
become
a
heap
of
ashes
come
said
horace
to
himself
that
puts
jarjarees
out
of
action
any
way
the
odd
thing
is
that
fakrash
should
never
have
heard
of
it
but
as
he
saw
on
reflection
it
was
not
so
very
odd
after
all
as
the
incident
had
probably
happened
after
the
jinnee
had
been
consigned
to
his
brass
bottle
where
intelligence
of
any
kind
would
be
most
unlikely
to
reach
him
he
worked
steadily
through
the
whole
of
the
second
volume
and
part
of
the
third
but
although
he
picked
up
a
certain
amount
of
information
upon
oriental
habits
and
modes
of
thought
and
speech
which
might
come
in
useful
later
it
was
not
until
he
arrived
at
the
chapter
of
the
third
volume
that
his
interest
really
revived
for
the
chapter
contained
the
story
of
and
and
it
was
only
natural
that
he
should
be
anxious
to
know
all
that
there
was
to
know
concerning
the
antecedents
of
one
who
might
be
his
before
long
he
read
eagerly
bedeea
it
appeared
was
the
lovely
daughter
of
shahyal
one
of
the
kings
of
the
believing
jann
her
father
not
fakrash
himself
as
the
jinnee
had
incorrectly
represented
had
offered
her
in
marriage
to
no
less
a
personage
than
king
solomon
himself
who
however
had
preferred
the
queen
of
sheba
seyf
the
son
of
the
king
of
egypt
afterwards
fell
desperately
in
love
with
bedeea
but
she
and
her
grandmother
both
declared
that
between
mankind
and
the
jann
there
could
be
no
agreement
and
seyf
was
a
king
son
commented
horace
i
need
alarm
myself
she
would
be
likely
to
have
anything
to
say
to
it
just
as
i
told
fakrash
his
heart
grew
lighter
still
as
he
came
to
the
end
for
he
learnt
that
after
many
adventures
which
need
not
be
mentioned
here
the
devoted
seyf
did
actually
succeed
in
gaining
the
proud
bedeea
as
his
wife
even
fakrash
could
not
propose
to
marry
me
to
some
one
who
has
a
husband
already
he
thought
still
she
be
a
widow
to
his
relief
however
the
conclusion
ran
thus
lived
with
a
most
pleasant
and
agreeable
life
until
they
were
visited
by
the
terminator
of
delights
and
the
separator
of
companions
if
that
means
anything
at
all
he
reasoned
it
means
that
seyf
and
bedeea
are
both
deceased
even
jinneeyeh
seem
to
be
mortal
or
perhaps
she
became
so
by
marrying
a
mortal
i
dare
say
that
fakrash
himself
would
have
lasted
all
this
time
if
he
had
been
bottled
like
a
tinned
tomato
but
i
glad
i
found
this
out
because
fakrash
is
evidently
unaware
of
it
and
if
he
persist
in
any
more
of
this
nonsense
i
think
i
see
my
way
now
to
getting
the
better
of
him
so
with
renewed
hope
and
in
vastly
improved
spirits
he
went
to
bed
and
was
soon
sound
asleep
chapter
xv
blushing
honours
it
was
rather
late
the
next
morning
when
ventimore
opened
his
eyes
to
discover
the
jinnee
standing
by
the
foot
of
his
bed
oh
it
is
it
he
said
sleepily
how
did
you
a
get
on
last
night
i
gained
such
information
as
i
desired
said
fakrash
guardedly
and
now
for
the
last
time
i
am
come
to
ask
thee
whether
thou
wilt
still
persist
in
refusing
to
wed
the
illustrious
and
have
a
care
how
thou
answerest
so
you
have
given
up
the
idea
said
horace
well
since
you
make
such
a
point
of
it
i
meet
you
as
far
as
this
if
you
produce
the
lady
and
she
consents
to
marry
me
i
wo
decline
the
honour
but
there
one
condition
i
really
insist
on
it
is
not
for
thee
to
make
stipulations
still
yet
this
once
i
will
hear
thee
i
sure
you
see
that
it
only
fair
supposing
for
any
reason
you
ca
persuade
the
princess
to
meet
me
within
a
reasonable
time
shall
we
say
a
week
thou
shalt
be
admitted
to
her
presence
within
hours
said
the
jinnee
that
better
still
then
if
i
do
see
her
within
hours
i
am
to
be
at
liberty
to
infer
that
the
negotiations
are
off
and
i
may
marry
anybody
else
i
please
without
any
opposition
from
you
is
that
understood
it
is
agreed
said
fakrash
for
i
am
confident
that
bedeea
will
accept
thee
joyfully
we
shall
see
said
horace
but
it
might
be
as
well
if
you
went
and
prepared
her
a
little
i
suppose
you
know
where
to
find
her
and
only
hours
you
know
more
than
is
needed
answered
the
jinnee
with
such
childlike
confidence
that
horace
felt
almost
ashamed
of
so
easy
a
victory
but
the
sun
is
already
high
arise
my
son
put
on
these
robes
and
with
this
he
flung
on
the
bed
the
magnificent
raiment
which
ventimore
had
last
worn
on
the
night
of
his
disastrous
entertainment
and
when
thou
hast
broken
thy
fast
prepare
to
accompany
me
before
i
agree
to
that
said
horace
sitting
up
in
bed
i
should
like
to
know
where
you
taking
me
to
obey
me
without
demur
said
fakrash
or
thou
knowest
the
consequences
it
seemed
to
horace
that
it
was
as
well
to
humour
him
and
he
got
up
accordingly
washed
and
shaved
and
putting
on
his
dazzling
robe
of
thickly
sewn
with
gems
he
joined
fakrash
who
by
the
way
was
similarly
if
less
gorgeously
arrayed
in
the
in
a
state
of
some
mystification
eat
quickly
commanded
the
jinnee
for
the
time
is
short
and
horace
after
hastily
disposing
of
a
cold
poached
egg
and
a
cup
of
coffee
happened
to
go
to
the
windows
good
heavens
he
cried
what
does
all
this
mean
he
might
well
ask
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
by
the
railings
of
the
square
a
large
crowd
had
collected
all
staring
at
the
house
in
eager
expectation
as
they
caught
sight
of
him
they
raised
a
cheer
which
caused
him
to
retreat
in
confusion
but
not
before
he
had
seen
a
great
golden
chariot
with
six
magnificent
horses
and
a
suite
of
swarthy
attendants
in
barbaric
liveries
standing
by
the
pavement
below
whose
carriage
is
that
he
asked
it
belongs
to
thee
said
the
jinnee
descend
then
and
make
thy
progress
in
it
through
the
city
i
will
not
said
horace
even
to
oblige
you
i
simply
ca
drive
along
the
streets
in
a
thing
like
the
of
a
travelling
circus
it
is
necessary
declared
fakrash
must
i
again
recall
to
thee
the
penalty
of
disobedience
oh
very
well
said
horace
irritably
if
you
insist
on
my
making
a
fool
of
myself
i
suppose
i
must
but
where
am
i
to
drive
and
why
that
replied
fakrash
thou
shalt
discover
at
the
fitting
moment
and
so
amidst
the
shouts
of
the
spectators
ventimore
climbed
up
into
the
vehicle
while
the
jinnee
took
his
seat
by
his
side
horace
had
a
parting
glimpse
of
and
rapkin
respective
noses
flattened
against
the
basement
window
and
then
two
dusky
slaves
mounted
to
a
seat
at
the
back
of
the
chariot
and
the
horses
started
off
at
a
stately
trot
in
the
direction
of
rochester
row
i
think
you
might
tell
me
what
all
this
means
he
said
you
no
conception
what
an
ass
i
feel
stuck
up
here
like
this
dismiss
bashfulness
from
thee
since
all
this
is
designed
to
render
thee
more
acceptable
in
the
eyes
of
the
princess
bedeea
said
the
jinnee
horace
said
no
more
though
he
could
not
but
think
that
this
parade
would
be
thrown
away
but
as
they
turned
into
victoria
street
and
seemed
to
be
heading
straight
for
the
abbey
a
horrible
thought
occurred
to
him
after
all
his
only
authority
for
the
marriage
and
decease
of
bedeea
was
the
arabian
nights
which
was
not
unimpeachable
evidence
what
if
she
were
alive
and
waiting
for
the
arrival
of
the
bridegroom
no
one
but
fakrash
would
have
conceived
such
an
idea
as
marrying
him
to
a
jinneeyeh
in
westminster
abbey
but
he
was
capable
of
any
extravagance
and
there
were
apparently
no
limits
to
his
power
fakrash
he
said
hoarsely
surely
this
is
my
my
wedding
day
you
not
going
to
have
the
ceremony
nay
said
the
jinnee
be
not
impatient
for
this
edifice
would
be
totally
unfitted
for
the
celebration
of
such
nuptials
as
thine
as
he
spoke
the
chariot
left
the
abbey
on
the
right
and
turned
down
the
embankment
the
relief
was
so
intense
that
horace
spirits
rose
irrepressibly
it
was
absurd
to
suppose
that
even
fakrash
could
have
arranged
the
ceremony
in
so
short
a
time
he
was
merely
being
taken
for
a
drive
and
fortunately
his
best
friends
could
not
recognise
him
in
his
oriental
disguise
and
it
was
a
glorious
morning
with
a
touch
of
frost
in
the
air
and
a
sky
of
streaky
turquoise
and
pale
golden
clouds
the
broad
river
glittered
in
the
sunshine
the
pavements
were
lined
with
admiring
crowds
and
the
carriage
rolled
on
amidst
frantic
enthusiasm
like
some
triumphal
car
how
they
cheering
us
said
horace
why
they
could
make
more
row
for
the
lord
mayor
himself
what
is
this
lord
mayor
of
whom
thou
speakest
inquired
fakrash
the
lord
mayor
said
horace
oh
he
unique
there
nobody
in
the
world
quite
like
him
he
administers
the
law
and
if
there
any
distress
in
any
part
of
the
earth
he
relieves
it
he
entertains
monarchs
and
princes
and
all
kinds
of
potentates
at
his
banquets
and
altogether
he
a
tremendous
swell
hath
he
dominion
over
the
earth
and
the
air
and
all
that
is
therein
within
his
own
precincts
i
believe
he
has
said
horace
rather
lazily
but
i
really
do
know
precisely
how
wide
his
powers
are
he
was
vainly
trying
to
recollect
whether
such
matters
as
telephones
and
telegraphs
in
the
city
were
within
the
lord
jurisdiction
or
the
county
council
fakrash
remained
silent
just
as
they
were
driving
underneath
charing
cross
railway
bridge
when
he
started
perceptibly
at
the
thunder
of
the
trains
overhead
and
the
piercing
whistles
of
the
engines
tell
me
he
said
clutching
horace
by
the
arm
what
meaneth
this
you
do
mean
to
say
said
horace
that
you
have
been
about
london
all
these
days
and
never
noticed
things
like
these
before
till
now
said
the
jinnee
i
have
had
no
leisure
to
observe
them
and
discover
their
nature
well
said
horace
anxious
to
let
the
jinnee
see
that
he
had
not
the
monopoly
of
miracles
since
your
days
we
have
discovered
how
to
tame
or
chain
the
great
forces
of
nature
and
compel
them
to
do
our
will
we
control
the
spirits
of
earth
air
fire
and
water
and
make
them
give
us
light
and
heat
carry
our
messages
fight
our
quarrels
for
us
transport
us
wherever
we
wish
to
go
with
a
certainty
and
precision
that
throw
even
your
performances
my
dear
sir
entirely
into
the
shade
considering
what
a
very
large
majority
of
civilised
persons
would
be
as
powerless
to
construct
the
most
elementary
machine
as
to
create
the
humblest
kind
of
horse
it
is
not
a
little
odd
how
complacently
we
credit
ourselves
with
all
the
latest
achievements
of
our
generation
most
of
us
accept
the
amazement
of
the
barbarian
on
his
first
introduction
to
modern
inventions
as
a
gratifying
personal
tribute
we
feel
a
certain
superiority
even
if
we
magnanimously
refrain
from
boastfulness
and
yet
our
own
particular
share
in
these
discoveries
is
limited
to
making
use
of
them
under
expert
guidance
which
any
barbarian
after
overcoming
his
first
terror
is
quite
as
competent
to
do
as
we
are
it
is
a
harmless
vanity
enough
and
especially
pardonable
in
case
when
it
was
so
desirable
to
correct
any
tendency
to
uppishness
on
the
part
of
the
jinnee
and
doth
the
lord
mayor
dispose
of
these
forces
at
his
will
inquired
fakrash
on
whom
ventimore
explanation
had
evidently
produced
some
impression
certainly
said
horace
whenever
he
has
occasion
the
jinnee
seemed
engrossed
in
his
own
thoughts
for
he
said
no
more
just
then
they
were
now
nearing
paul
cathedral
and
horace
first
suspicion
returned
with
double
force
fakrash
answer
me
he
said
is
this
my
wedding
day
or
not
if
it
is
it
time
i
was
told
not
yet
said
the
jinnee
enigmatically
and
indeed
it
proved
to
be
another
false
alarm
for
they
turned
down
cannon
street
and
towards
the
mansion
house
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
why
we
going
through
victoria
street
and
what
all
this
crowd
has
come
out
for
asked
ventimore
for
the
throng
was
denser
than
ever
the
people
surged
and
swayed
in
serried
ranks
behind
the
city
police
and
gazed
with
a
wonder
and
awe
that
for
once
seemed
to
have
entirely
silenced
the
cockney
instinct
of
for
what
else
but
to
do
thee
honour
answered
fakrash
what
bosh
said
horace
they
mistake
me
for
the
shah
or
somebody
and
no
wonder
in
this
not
so
said
the
jinnee
thy
names
are
familiar
to
them
horace
glanced
up
at
the
hastily
improvised
decorations
on
one
large
strip
of
bunting
which
spanned
the
street
he
read
welcome
to
the
city
most
distinguished
guest
they
ca
mean
me
he
thought
and
then
another
legend
caught
his
eye
well
done
ventimore
and
an
enthusiastic
householder
next
door
had
burst
into
poetry
and
displayed
the
couplet
would
we
had
twenty
more
like
horace
ventimore
they
mean
me
he
exclaimed
now
fakrash
you
kindly
explain
what
tomfoolery
you
been
up
to
now
i
know
you
at
the
bottom
of
this
business
it
struck
him
that
the
jinnee
was
slightly
embarrassed
didst
thou
not
say
he
replied
that
he
who
should
receive
the
freedom
of
the
city
from
his
would
be
worthy
of
i
may
have
said
something
of
the
sort
but
good
heavens
you
mean
that
you
have
contrived
that
should
receive
the
freedom
of
the
city
it
was
the
easiest
affair
possible
said
the
jinnee
but
he
did
not
attempt
to
meet
horace
eye
was
it
though
said
horace
in
a
white
rage
i
do
want
to
be
inquisitive
but
i
should
like
to
know
what
i
done
to
deserve
it
why
trouble
thyself
with
the
reason
let
it
suffice
thee
that
such
honour
is
bestowed
upon
thee
by
this
time
the
chariot
had
crossed
cheapside
and
was
entering
king
street
this
really
wo
do
urged
horace
it
not
fair
to
me
either
done
something
or
you
must
have
made
the
corporation
done
something
to
be
received
like
this
and
as
we
shall
be
in
the
guildhall
in
a
very
few
seconds
you
may
as
well
tell
me
what
it
is
regarding
that
matter
replied
the
jinnee
in
some
confusion
i
am
truly
as
ignorant
as
thyself
as
he
spoke
they
drove
through
some
temporary
wooden
gates
into
the
courtyard
where
the
honourable
artillery
company
presented
arms
to
them
and
the
carriage
drew
up
before
a
large
marquee
decorated
with
shields
and
clustered
banners
well
fakrash
said
horace
with
suppressed
fury
as
he
alighted
you
have
surpassed
yourself
this
time
you
got
me
into
a
nice
scrape
and
you
have
to
pull
me
through
it
as
well
as
you
can
have
no
uneasiness
said
the
jinnee
as
he
accompanied
his
into
the
marquee
which
was
brilliant
with
pretty
women
in
smart
frocks
officers
in
scarlet
tunics
and
plumed
hats
and
servants
in
state
liveries
their
entrance
was
greeted
by
a
buzz
of
applause
and
admiration
and
an
official
who
introduced
himself
as
the
prime
warden
of
the
company
advanced
to
meet
them
the
lord
mayor
will
receive
you
in
the
library
he
said
if
you
will
have
the
kindness
to
follow
me
horace
followed
him
mechanically
i
in
for
it
now
he
thought
whatever
it
is
if
i
can
only
trust
fakrash
to
back
me
up
but
hanged
if
i
do
believe
he
more
nervous
than
i
am
as
they
came
into
the
noble
library
of
the
guildhall
a
fine
string
band
struck
up
and
horace
with
the
jinnee
in
his
rear
made
his
way
through
a
lane
of
distinguished
spectators
towards
a
dais
on
the
steps
of
which
in
his
robes
and
hat
stood
the
lord
mayor
with
his
sword
and
on
either
hand
and
behind
him
a
row
of
beaming
sheriffs
a
truly
stately
and
imposing
figure
did
the
chief
magistrate
for
that
particular
year
present
tall
dignified
with
a
lofty
forehead
whose
polished
temples
reflected
the
light
an
aquiline
nose
and
piercing
black
eyes
under
heavy
white
eyebrows
a
frosty
pink
in
his
wrinkled
cheeks
and
a
flowing
silver
beard
with
a
touch
of
gold
still
lingering
under
the
lower
lip
he
seemed
as
he
stood
there
a
worthy
representative
of
the
greatest
and
richest
city
in
the
world
horace
approached
the
steps
with
an
unpleasant
sensation
of
weakness
at
the
knees
and
no
sort
of
idea
what
he
was
expected
to
do
or
say
when
he
arrived
and
in
his
perplexity
he
turned
for
support
and
guidance
to
his
mentor
only
to
discover
that
the
jinnee
whose
and
ignorance
had
planted
him
in
this
present
false
position
had
mysteriously
and
perfidiously
disappeared
and
left
him
to
grapple
with
the
situation
chapter
xvi
a
killing
frost
fortunately
for
ventimore
the
momentary
dismay
he
had
felt
on
finding
himself
deserted
by
his
unfathomable
jinnee
at
the
very
outset
of
the
ceremony
passed
unnoticed
as
the
prime
warden
of
the
company
immediately
came
to
his
rescue
by
briefly
introducing
him
to
the
lord
mayor
who
with
dignified
courtesy
had
descended
to
the
lowest
step
of
the
dais
to
receive
him
ventimore
said
the
chief
magistrate
cordially
as
he
pressed
horace
hand
you
must
allow
me
to
say
that
i
consider
this
one
of
the
greatest
privileges
if
not
greatest
privilege
that
have
fallen
to
my
lot
during
a
term
of
office
in
which
i
have
had
the
honour
of
welcoming
more
than
the
usual
number
of
illustrious
visitors
my
lord
mayor
said
horace
with
absolute
sincerity
you
really
overwhelm
me
i
i
only
wish
i
could
feel
that
i
had
done
anything
to
deserve
this
this
magnificent
compliment
ah
replied
the
lord
mayor
in
a
paternally
rallying
tone
modest
my
dear
sir
i
perceive
like
all
truly
great
men
a
most
admirable
trait
permit
me
to
present
you
to
the
sheriffs
the
sheriffs
appeared
highly
delighted
horace
shook
hands
with
both
of
them
indeed
in
the
flurry
of
the
moment
he
very
nearly
offered
to
do
so
with
the
sword
and
mace
bearers
as
well
but
their
hands
were
as
it
happened
otherwise
engaged
the
actual
presentation
said
the
lord
mayor
takes
place
in
the
great
hall
as
you
are
doubtless
aware
i
i
have
been
given
to
understand
so
said
horace
with
a
sinking
heart
for
he
had
begun
to
hope
that
the
worst
was
over
but
before
we
adjourn
said
his
host
you
will
let
me
tempt
you
to
partake
of
some
slight
refreshment
just
a
snack
horace
was
not
hungry
but
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
get
through
the
ceremony
with
more
credit
after
a
glass
of
champagne
so
he
accepted
the
invitation
and
was
conducted
to
an
extemporised
buffet
at
one
end
of
the
library
where
he
fortified
himself
for
the
impending
ordeal
with
a
sandwich
and
a
bumper
of
the
driest
champagne
in
the
corporation
cellars
they
talk
of
abolishing
us
said
the
lord
mayor
as
he
took
an
anchovy
on
toast
but
i
maintain
ventimore
i
maintain
that
we
with
our
ancient
customs
our
traditions
form
a
link
with
the
past
which
a
wise
statesman
will
preserve
if
i
may
employ
a
somewhat
vulgar
term
untinkered
with
horace
agreed
remembering
a
link
with
a
far
more
ancient
past
with
which
he
devoutly
wished
he
had
refrained
from
tinkering
talking
of
ancient
customs
the
lord
mayor
continued
with
an
odd
blend
of
pride
and
apology
you
will
shortly
have
an
illustration
of
our
antiquated
procedure
which
may
impress
you
as
quaint
horace
feeling
absolutely
idiotic
murmured
that
he
felt
sure
it
would
do
that
before
presenting
you
for
the
freedom
the
prime
warden
and
five
officials
of
the
company
will
give
their
testimony
as
compurgators
in
your
favour
making
oath
that
you
are
man
of
good
name
and
fame
and
that
you
will
be
amused
at
this
ventimore
that
you
desire
the
freedom
of
this
city
whereby
to
defraud
the
queen
or
the
city
ha
ha
curious
way
of
putting
it
is
it
not
very
said
horace
guiltily
and
not
a
little
concerned
on
the
official
account
a
mere
form
said
the
lord
mayor
but
i
for
one
ventimore
i
for
one
should
be
sorry
to
see
the
picturesque
old
practices
die
out
to
my
mind
he
added
as
he
finished
a
de
foie
sandwich
the
modern
impatience
to
sweep
away
all
the
ancient
landmarks
whether
they
be
superannuated
or
not
is
one
of
the
most
disquieting
symptoms
of
the
age
you
wo
have
any
more
champagne
then
i
think
we
had
better
be
making
our
way
to
the
great
hall
for
the
event
of
the
day
i
afraid
said
horace
with
a
sudden
consciousness
of
his
incongruously
oriental
attire
i
afraid
this
is
not
quite
the
sort
of
dress
for
such
a
ceremony
if
i
had
known
now
do
say
another
word
said
the
lord
mayor
your
costume
is
very
nice
very
nice
indeed
and
and
most
appropriate
i
am
sure
but
i
see
the
city
marshal
is
waiting
for
us
to
head
the
procession
shall
we
lead
the
way
the
band
struck
up
the
march
of
the
priests
from
and
horace
his
head
in
a
whirl
walked
with
his
host
followed
by
the
city
lands
committee
the
sheriffs
and
other
dignitaries
through
the
art
gallery
and
into
the
great
hall
where
their
entrance
was
heralded
by
a
flourish
of
trumpets
the
hall
was
crowded
and
ventimore
found
himself
the
object
of
a
popular
demonstration
which
would
have
filled
him
with
joy
and
pride
if
he
could
only
have
felt
that
he
had
done
anything
whatever
to
justify
it
for
it
was
ridiculous
to
suppose
that
he
had
rendered
himself
a
public
benefactor
by
restoring
a
convicted
jinnee
to
freedom
and
society
generally
his
only
consolation
was
that
the
english
are
a
race
not
given
to
effusiveness
without
very
good
reason
and
that
before
the
ceremony
was
over
he
would
be
enabled
to
gather
what
were
the
particular
services
which
had
excited
such
unbounded
enthusiasm
meanwhile
he
stood
there
on
the
and
dais
bowing
repeatedly
and
trusting
that
he
did
not
look
so
forlornly
foolish
as
he
felt
a
long
shaft
of
sunlight
struck
down
between
the
gothic
rafters
and
dappled
the
brown
stone
walls
with
patches
of
gold
the
electric
lights
in
the
big
hooped
chandeliers
showed
pale
and
feeble
against
the
subdued
glow
of
the
stained
glass
the
air
was
heavy
with
the
scent
of
flowers
and
essences
then
there
was
a
rustle
of
expectation
in
the
audience
and
a
pause
in
which
it
seemed
to
horace
that
everybody
on
the
dais
was
almost
as
nervous
and
at
a
loss
what
to
do
next
as
he
was
himself
he
wished
with
all
his
soul
that
they
would
hurry
the
ceremony
through
anyhow
and
let
him
go
at
length
the
proceedings
began
by
a
sort
of
solemn
affectation
of
having
merely
met
there
for
the
ordinary
business
of
the
day
which
to
horace
just
then
seemed
childish
in
the
extreme
it
was
resolved
that
items
to
on
the
agenda
need
not
be
discussed
which
brought
them
to
item
item
was
a
resolution
read
by
the
town
clerk
that
the
freedom
of
the
city
should
be
presented
to
horace
ventimore
citizen
and
which
last
horace
was
not
aware
of
being
but
supposed
vaguely
that
it
had
been
somehow
managed
while
he
was
at
the
buffet
in
the
library
in
recognition
of
his
services
the
resolution
ran
and
horace
listened
with
all
his
ears
especially
in
connection
with
it
was
most
unfortunate
but
at
this
precise
point
the
official
was
seized
with
an
attack
of
coughing
in
which
all
was
lost
but
the
conclusion
of
the
sentence
that
have
justly
entitled
him
to
the
gratitude
and
admiration
of
his
then
the
six
compurgators
came
forward
and
vouched
for
fitness
to
receive
the
freedom
he
had
painful
doubts
whether
they
altogether
understood
what
a
responsibility
they
were
undertaking
but
it
was
too
late
to
warn
them
and
he
could
only
trust
that
they
knew
more
of
their
business
than
he
did
after
this
the
city
chamberlain
read
him
an
address
to
which
horace
listened
in
resigned
bewilderment
the
chamberlain
referred
to
the
unanimity
and
enthusiasm
with
which
the
resolution
had
been
carried
and
said
that
it
was
his
pleasing
and
honourable
duty
as
the
mouthpiece
of
that
ancient
city
to
address
what
he
described
with
some
inadequacy
as
a
few
words
to
one
by
adding
whose
name
to
their
roll
of
freemen
the
corporation
honoured
rather
themselves
than
the
recipient
of
their
homage
it
was
flattering
but
to
horace
ear
the
phrases
sounded
excessive
almost
fulsome
though
of
course
that
depended
very
much
on
what
he
had
done
which
he
had
still
to
ascertain
the
orator
proceeded
to
read
him
the
illustrious
list
of
london
roll
of
fame
a
recital
which
made
horace
shiver
with
apprehension
for
what
names
they
were
what
glorious
deeds
they
had
performed
how
was
it
possible
that
he
plain
horace
ventimore
a
struggling
architect
who
had
missed
his
one
great
chance
could
have
achieved
especially
without
even
being
aware
of
it
anything
that
would
not
seem
ludicrously
insignificant
by
comparison
he
had
a
morbid
fancy
that
the
marble
goddesses
or
whoever
they
were
at
the
base
of
nelson
monument
opposite
were
regarding
him
with
stony
disdain
and
indignation
that
the
statue
of
wellington
knew
him
for
an
arrant
impostor
and
averted
his
head
with
cold
contempt
and
that
the
effigy
of
lord
mayor
beckford
on
the
right
of
the
dais
would
come
to
life
and
denounce
him
in
another
moment
turning
now
to
your
own
distinguished
services
he
suddenly
heard
the
city
chamberlain
resuming
you
are
probably
aware
sir
that
it
is
customary
on
these
occasions
to
mention
specifically
the
particular
merit
which
had
been
deemed
worthy
of
civic
recognition
horace
was
greatly
relieved
to
hear
it
for
it
struck
him
as
a
most
sensible
and
in
his
own
particular
case
essential
formality
but
on
the
present
occasion
sir
proceeded
the
speaker
i
feel
as
all
present
must
feel
that
it
would
be
unnecessary
nay
almost
impertinent
were
i
to
weary
the
public
ear
by
a
halting
recapitulation
of
deeds
with
which
it
is
already
so
appreciatively
familiar
at
this
he
was
interrupted
by
deafening
and
applause
at
the
end
of
which
he
continued
i
have
only
therefore
to
greet
you
in
the
name
of
the
corporation
and
to
offer
you
the
right
hand
of
fellowship
as
a
freeman
and
citizen
and
of
london
as
he
shook
hands
he
presented
horace
with
a
copy
of
the
oath
of
allegiance
intimating
that
he
was
to
read
it
aloud
naturally
ventimore
had
not
the
least
objection
to
swear
to
be
good
and
true
to
our
sovereign
lady
queen
victoria
or
to
be
obedient
to
the
lord
mayor
and
warn
him
of
any
conspiracies
against
the
queen
peace
which
might
chance
to
come
under
his
observation
so
he
took
the
oath
cheerfully
enough
and
hoped
that
this
was
really
the
end
of
the
ceremony
however
to
his
great
chagrin
and
apprehension
the
lord
mayor
rose
with
the
evident
intention
of
making
a
speech
he
said
that
the
conclusion
of
the
city
to
bestow
the
highest
honour
in
their
gift
upon
horace
ventimore
had
been
here
he
hesitated
somewhat
hastily
arrived
at
personally
he
would
have
liked
a
longer
time
to
prepare
to
make
the
display
less
inadequate
to
and
worthier
of
this
exceptional
occasion
he
thought
that
was
the
general
feeling
it
evidently
was
judging
from
the
loud
and
unanimous
cheering
however
for
reasons
which
for
reasons
with
which
they
were
as
well
acquainted
as
himself
the
notice
had
been
short
the
corporation
had
yielded
as
they
always
did
as
it
would
always
be
their
pride
and
pleasure
to
yield
to
popular
pressure
which
was
practically
irresistible
and
had
done
the
best
they
could
in
the
limited
he
might
almost
say
the
unprecedentedly
limited
period
allowed
them
the
proudest
leaf
in
ventimore
chaplet
of
laurels
was
he
would
venture
to
assert
the
sight
of
the
extraordinary
enthusiasm
and
assemblage
not
only
in
that
noble
hall
but
in
the
thoroughfares
of
this
mighty
metropolis
under
the
circumstances
this
was
a
marvellous
tribute
to
the
admiration
and
affection
which
ventimore
had
succeeded
in
inspiring
in
the
great
heart
of
the
people
rich
and
poor
high
and
low
he
would
not
detain
his
hearers
any
longer
all
that
remained
for
him
to
do
was
to
ask
ventimore
acceptance
of
a
golden
casket
containing
the
roll
of
freedom
and
he
felt
sure
that
their
distinguished
guest
before
proceeding
to
inscribe
his
name
on
the
register
would
oblige
them
all
by
some
account
from
his
own
lips
of
of
the
events
in
which
he
had
figured
so
prominently
and
so
creditably
horace
received
the
casket
mechanically
there
was
a
universal
cry
of
speech
from
the
audience
to
which
he
replied
by
shaking
his
head
in
helpless
deprecation
but
in
vain
he
found
himself
irresistibly
pressed
towards
the
rail
in
front
of
the
dais
and
the
roar
of
applause
which
greeted
him
saved
him
from
all
necessity
of
attempting
to
speak
for
nearly
two
minutes
during
that
interval
he
had
time
to
clear
his
brain
and
think
what
he
had
better
do
or
say
in
his
present
unenviable
dilemma
for
some
time
past
a
suspicion
had
been
growing
in
his
mind
until
it
had
now
almost
swollen
into
certainty
he
felt
that
before
he
compromised
himself
or
allowed
his
too
generous
entertainers
to
compromise
themselves
irretrievably
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
ascertain
his
real
position
and
to
do
that
he
must
make
some
sort
of
speech
with
this
resolve
all
his
nervousness
and
embarrassment
and
indecision
melted
away
he
faced
the
assembly
coolly
and
gallantly
convinced
that
his
best
alternative
now
lay
in
perfect
candour
my
lord
mayor
my
lords
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
began
in
a
clear
voice
which
penetrated
to
the
farthest
gallery
and
commanded
instant
attention
if
you
expect
to
hear
from
me
any
description
of
what
done
to
be
received
like
this
i
afraid
you
will
be
disappointed
for
my
own
belief
is
that
i
done
nothing
whatever
there
was
a
general
outcry
of
no
no
at
this
and
a
fervid
murmur
of
protest
it
all
very
well
to
say
no
said
horace
and
i
am
extremely
grateful
to
you
all
for
the
interruption
still
i
can
only
repeat
that
i
am
absolutely
unaware
of
having
ever
rendered
my
country
or
this
great
city
a
single
service
deserving
of
the
slightest
acknowledgment
i
wish
i
could
feel
i
had
but
the
truth
is
that
if
i
have
the
fact
has
entirely
slipped
from
my
memory
again
there
were
murmurs
this
time
with
a
certain
of
irritation
and
he
could
hear
the
lord
mayor
behind
him
remarking
to
the
city
chamberlain
that
this
was
not
at
all
the
kind
of
speech
for
the
occasion
i
know
what
you
thinking
said
horace
you
thinking
this
is
mock
modesty
on
my
part
but
it
nothing
of
the
sort
do
know
what
i
done
but
i
presume
you
are
all
better
informed
because
the
corporation
would
have
given
me
that
very
charming
casket
you
would
all
of
you
be
here
like
this
unless
you
were
under
a
strong
impression
that
i
done
to
deserve
it
at
this
there
was
a
fresh
outburst
of
applause
just
so
said
horace
calmly
well
now
will
any
of
you
be
kind
enough
to
tell
me
in
a
few
words
you
suppose
i
done
there
was
a
dead
silence
in
which
every
one
looked
at
his
or
her
neighbour
and
smiled
feebly
my
lord
mayor
continued
horace
i
appeal
to
you
to
tell
me
and
this
distinguished
assembly
why
on
earth
we
all
here
the
lord
mayor
rose
i
think
it
sufficient
to
say
he
announced
with
dignity
that
the
corporation
and
myself
were
unanimously
of
opinion
that
this
distinction
should
be
awarded
for
reasons
which
it
is
unnecessary
and
hum
ha
invidious
to
enter
into
here
i
am
sorry
persisted
horace
but
i
must
press
your
lordship
for
those
reasons
i
have
an
object
will
the
city
chamberlain
oblige
me
then
no
well
then
the
town
clerk
no
it
just
as
i
suspected
none
of
you
can
give
me
your
reasons
and
shall
i
tell
you
why
because
there
any
now
do
bear
with
me
for
a
moment
i
quite
aware
this
is
very
embarrassing
for
all
of
you
but
remember
that
it
infinitely
more
awkward
for
i
really
can
not
accept
the
freedom
of
the
city
under
any
suspicion
of
false
pretences
it
would
be
a
poor
reward
for
your
hospitality
and
base
and
unpatriotic
into
the
bargain
to
depreciate
the
value
of
so
great
a
distinction
by
permitting
it
to
be
conferred
unworthily
if
after
you
heard
what
i
am
going
to
tell
you
you
still
insist
on
my
accepting
such
an
honour
of
course
i
will
not
be
so
ungracious
as
to
refuse
it
but
i
really
do
feel
that
it
would
be
right
to
inscribe
my
name
on
your
roll
of
fame
without
some
sort
of
explanation
if
i
did
i
might
for
anything
i
know
involuntarily
be
signing
the
of
the
corporation
there
was
a
breathless
hush
upon
this
the
silence
grew
so
intense
that
to
borrow
a
slightly
involved
metaphor
from
a
distinguished
friend
of
the
writer
you
might
have
picked
up
a
pin
in
it
horace
leaned
sideways
against
the
rail
in
an
easy
attitude
so
as
to
face
the
lord
mayor
as
well
as
a
portion
of
his
audience
before
i
go
any
farther
he
said
will
your
lordship
pardon
me
if
i
suggest
that
it
might
be
as
well
to
direct
that
all
reporters
present
should
immediately
withdraw
the
reporters
table
was
instantly
in
a
stir
of
anger
and
many
of
the
guests
expressed
some
dissatisfaction
we
at
least
said
the
lord
mayor
rising
flushed
with
annoyance
have
no
reason
to
dread
publicity
i
decline
to
make
a
affair
of
this
i
shall
give
no
such
orders
very
well
said
horace
when
the
chorus
of
approval
had
subsided
my
suggestion
was
made
quite
as
much
in
the
corporation
interests
as
mine
i
merely
thought
that
when
you
all
clearly
understood
how
grossly
you
been
deluded
you
might
prefer
to
have
the
details
kept
out
of
the
newspapers
if
possible
but
if
you
particularly
want
them
published
over
the
whole
world
why
of
course
an
uproar
followed
here
under
cover
of
which
the
lord
mayor
contrived
to
give
orders
to
have
the
doors
fastened
till
further
directions
do
make
this
more
difficult
and
disagreeable
for
me
than
it
is
already
said
horace
as
soon
as
he
could
obtain
a
hearing
again
you
do
suppose
that
i
should
have
come
here
in
this
dress
imposing
myself
on
the
hospitality
of
this
great
city
if
i
could
have
helped
it
if
you
been
brought
here
under
false
pretences
so
have
i
if
you
been
made
to
look
rather
foolish
what
is
situation
to
mine
the
fact
is
i
am
the
victim
of
a
headstrong
force
which
i
am
utterly
unable
to
control
upon
this
a
fresh
uproar
arose
and
prevented
him
from
continuing
for
some
time
i
only
ask
for
fair
play
and
a
patient
hearing
he
pleaded
give
me
that
and
i
will
undertake
to
restore
you
all
to
good
humour
before
i
have
done
they
calmed
down
at
this
appeal
and
he
was
able
to
proceed
my
case
is
simply
this
he
said
a
little
time
ago
i
happened
to
go
to
an
auction
and
buy
a
large
brass
bottle
for
some
inexplicable
reason
his
last
words
roused
the
audience
to
absolute
frenzy
they
would
not
hear
anything
about
the
brass
bottle
every
time
he
attempted
to
mention
it
they
howled
him
down
they
hissed
they
groaned
they
shook
their
fists
the
din
was
positively
deafening
nor
was
the
demonstration
confined
to
the
male
portion
of
the
assembly
one
lady
indeed
who
is
a
prominent
leader
in
society
but
whose
name
shall
not
be
divulged
here
was
so
carried
away
by
her
feelings
as
to
hurl
a
heavy
bottle
of
at
horace
offending
head
fortunately
for
him
it
missed
him
and
only
caught
one
of
the
officials
horace
was
not
in
a
mood
to
notice
details
very
accurately
but
he
had
a
notion
that
it
was
the
city
remembrancer
somewhere
about
the
region
of
the
you
hear
me
out
ventimore
shouted
i
not
trifling
i
have
told
you
yet
what
was
inside
the
bottle
when
i
opened
it
i
found
he
got
no
farther
for
as
the
words
left
his
lips
he
felt
himself
seized
by
the
collar
of
his
robe
and
lifted
off
his
feet
by
an
agency
he
was
powerless
to
resist
up
and
up
he
was
carried
past
the
great
chandeliers
between
the
carved
and
gilded
rafters
pursued
by
a
universal
shriek
of
dismay
and
horror
down
below
he
could
see
the
throng
of
pale
upturned
faces
and
hear
the
wild
screams
and
laughter
of
several
ladies
of
great
distinction
in
violent
hysterics
and
the
next
moment
he
was
in
the
glass
lantern
and
the
latticed
panes
gave
way
like
tissue
paper
as
he
broke
through
into
the
open
air
causing
the
pigeons
on
the
roof
to
whirr
up
in
a
flutter
of
alarm
of
course
he
knew
that
it
was
the
jinnee
who
was
abducting
him
in
this
sensational
manner
and
he
was
rather
relieved
than
alarmed
by
summary
proceeding
for
he
seemed
for
once
to
have
hit
upon
the
best
way
out
of
a
situation
that
was
rapidly
becoming
impossible
chapter
xvii
high
words
once
outside
in
the
open
air
the
jinnee
towered
like
a
pheasant
shot
through
the
breast
and
horace
closed
his
eyes
with
a
combined
sensation
during
a
flight
which
apparently
continued
for
hours
although
in
reality
it
probably
did
not
occupy
more
than
a
very
few
seconds
his
uneasiness
was
still
further
increased
by
his
inability
to
guess
where
he
was
being
taken
to
for
he
felt
instinctively
that
they
were
not
travelling
in
the
direction
of
home
at
last
he
felt
himself
set
down
on
some
hard
firm
surface
and
ventured
to
open
his
eyes
once
more
when
he
realised
where
he
actually
was
his
knees
gave
way
under
him
and
he
was
seized
with
a
sudden
giddiness
that
very
nearly
made
him
lose
his
balance
for
he
found
himself
standing
on
a
sort
of
narrow
ledge
or
cornice
immediately
under
the
ball
at
the
top
of
paul
many
feet
beneath
him
spread
the
dull
leaden
summit
of
the
dome
its
raised
ridges
stretching
like
huge
serpents
over
the
curve
beyond
which
was
a
glimpse
of
the
green
roof
of
the
nave
and
the
two
west
towers
with
their
grey
columns
and
buttresses
and
gilded
pineapples
which
shone
ruddily
in
the
sun
he
had
an
impression
of
ludgate
hill
and
fleet
street
as
a
deep
winding
ravine
steeped
in
partial
shadow
of
long
sierras
of
roofs
and
showing
their
sharp
outlines
above
of
the
broad
river
with
oily
ripples
and
a
golden
glitter
where
the
sunlight
touched
it
of
the
gleaming
slope
of
mud
under
the
wharves
and
warehouses
on
the
surrey
side
of
barges
and
steamers
moored
in
black
clusters
of
a
small
tug
fussing
noisily
down
the
river
leaving
a
broadening
in
its
wake
cautiously
he
moved
round
towards
the
east
where
the
houses
formed
a
blurred
mosaic
of
cream
slate
indigo
and
dull
reds
and
browns
above
which
slender
spires
and
towers
pierced
the
haze
stained
in
countless
places
by
pillars
of
black
grey
and
amber
smoke
and
lightened
by
plumes
and
jets
of
silvery
steam
till
all
blended
by
imperceptible
gradations
into
a
sky
of
tenderest
gold
slashed
with
translucent
blue
it
was
a
magnificent
view
and
none
the
less
so
because
the
indistinctness
of
all
beyond
a
limited
radius
made
the
huge
city
seem
not
only
mystical
but
absolutely
boundless
in
extent
but
although
ventimore
was
distinctly
conscious
of
all
this
he
was
scarcely
in
a
state
to
appreciate
its
grandeur
just
then
he
was
much
too
concerned
with
wondering
why
fakrash
had
chosen
to
plant
him
up
there
in
so
insecure
a
position
and
how
he
was
ever
to
be
rescued
from
it
since
the
jinnee
had
apparently
disappeared
he
was
not
far
off
however
for
presently
horace
saw
him
stalk
round
the
narrow
cornice
with
an
air
of
being
perfectly
at
home
on
it
so
there
you
are
said
ventimore
i
thought
you
deserted
me
again
what
have
you
brought
me
up
here
for
because
i
desired
to
have
speech
with
thee
in
private
replied
the
jinnee
we
not
likely
to
be
intruded
on
here
certainly
said
horace
but
is
it
rather
exposed
rather
public
if
we
seen
up
here
you
know
it
will
cause
a
decided
sensation
i
have
laid
a
spell
on
all
below
that
they
should
not
raise
their
eyes
be
seated
therefore
and
hear
my
words
horace
lowered
himself
carefully
to
a
sitting
position
so
that
his
legs
dangled
in
space
and
fakrash
took
a
seat
by
his
side
o
most
indiscreet
of
mankind
he
began
in
an
aggrieved
tone
thou
hast
been
near
the
committal
of
a
great
blunder
and
doing
ill
to
thyself
and
to
me
well
i
like
that
retorted
horace
when
you
let
me
in
for
all
that
freedom
of
the
city
business
and
then
sneaked
off
leaving
me
to
get
out
of
it
the
best
way
i
could
and
only
came
back
just
as
i
was
about
to
explain
matters
and
carried
me
up
through
the
roof
like
a
sack
of
flour
do
you
consider
that
tactful
on
your
part
thou
hadst
drunk
wine
and
permitted
it
to
creep
as
far
as
the
place
of
secrets
only
one
glass
said
horace
and
i
wanted
it
i
can
assure
you
i
was
obliged
to
make
a
speech
to
them
and
thanks
to
you
i
was
in
such
a
hole
that
i
saw
nothing
for
it
but
to
tell
the
truth
veracity
as
thou
wilt
learn
answered
the
jinnee
is
not
invariably
the
ship
of
safety
thou
wert
about
to
betray
the
benefactor
who
procured
for
thee
such
glory
and
honour
as
might
well
cause
the
of
lions
to
burst
with
envy
if
any
lion
with
the
least
sense
of
humour
could
have
witnessed
the
proceedings
said
ventimore
he
might
have
burst
with
laughter
certainly
not
envy
good
lord
fakrash
he
cried
in
his
indignation
i
never
felt
such
an
absolute
ass
in
my
whole
life
if
nothing
would
satisfy
you
but
my
receiving
the
freedom
of
the
city
you
might
at
least
have
contrived
some
decent
excuse
for
it
but
you
left
out
the
only
point
there
was
in
the
whole
thing
and
all
for
what
what
doth
it
signify
why
the
whole
populace
should
come
forth
to
acclaim
thee
and
do
thee
honour
so
long
as
they
did
so
said
fakrash
sullenly
for
the
report
of
thy
fame
would
reach
that
just
where
you
mistaken
said
horace
if
you
had
not
been
in
too
desperate
a
hurry
to
make
a
few
inquiries
you
would
have
found
out
that
you
were
taking
all
this
trouble
for
nothing
how
sayest
thou
well
you
would
have
discovered
that
the
princess
is
spared
all
temptation
to
marry
beneath
her
by
the
fact
that
she
became
the
bride
of
somebody
else
about
thirty
centuries
ago
she
married
a
mortal
one
a
king
son
and
they
both
been
dead
a
considerable
time
another
obstacle
to
your
plans
it
is
a
lie
declared
fakrash
if
you
will
take
me
back
to
vincent
square
i
shall
be
happy
to
show
you
the
evidence
in
your
national
records
said
horace
and
you
may
be
glad
to
know
that
your
old
enemy
jarjarees
came
to
a
violent
end
after
a
very
sporting
encounter
with
a
king
daughter
who
though
proficient
in
advanced
magic
unfortunately
perished
herself
poor
lady
in
the
final
round
i
had
intended
to
accomplish
his
downfall
said
fakrash
i
know
said
horace
it
was
most
thoughtful
of
you
but
i
doubt
if
i
should
have
done
it
half
as
well
and
it
would
have
probably
cost
me
an
eye
at
the
very
least
it
better
as
it
is
and
how
long
hast
thou
known
of
these
things
only
since
last
night
since
last
night
and
thou
didst
not
unfold
them
unto
me
till
this
instant
i
had
such
a
busy
morning
you
see
explained
horace
there
been
no
time
fool
that
i
was
to
bring
this
misbegotten
dog
into
the
august
presence
of
the
great
lord
mayor
himself
on
whom
be
peace
cried
the
jinnee
i
object
to
being
referred
to
as
a
misbegotten
dog
said
horace
but
with
the
rest
of
your
remark
i
entirely
concur
i
afraid
the
lord
mayor
is
very
far
from
being
at
peace
just
now
he
pointed
to
the
steep
roof
of
the
guildhall
with
its
dormers
and
fretted
pinnacles
and
the
slender
lantern
through
which
he
had
so
lately
made
his
inglorious
exit
there
the
devil
of
a
row
going
on
under
that
lantern
just
now
fakrash
you
may
depend
upon
that
they
locked
the
doors
till
they
can
decide
what
to
do
next
which
will
take
them
some
time
and
it
all
your
fault
it
was
thy
doing
why
didst
thou
dare
to
inform
the
lord
mayor
that
he
was
deceived
why
because
i
thought
he
ought
to
know
because
i
was
bound
particularly
after
my
oath
of
allegiance
to
warn
him
of
any
conspiracy
against
him
because
i
was
in
such
a
hat
he
understand
all
that
he
wo
blame
for
this
business
it
is
fortunate
observed
the
jinnee
that
i
flew
away
with
thee
before
thou
couldst
pronounce
my
name
you
gave
yourself
away
said
horace
they
all
saw
you
you
know
you
were
flying
so
particularly
fast
they
recognise
you
again
if
you
carry
off
a
man
from
under
the
lord
mayor
very
nose
and
shoot
up
through
the
roof
like
a
rocket
with
him
you
ca
expect
to
escape
some
notice
you
see
you
happen
to
be
the
only
unbottled
jinnee
in
this
city
fakrash
shifted
his
seat
on
the
cornice
i
have
committed
no
act
of
disrespect
unto
the
lord
mayor
he
said
therefore
he
can
have
no
just
cause
of
anger
against
me
horace
perceived
that
the
jinnee
was
not
altogether
at
ease
and
pushed
his
advantage
accordingly
my
dear
good
old
friend
he
said
you
do
seem
to
realise
yet
what
an
awful
thing
you
done
for
your
own
mistaken
purposes
you
have
compelled
the
chief
magistrate
and
the
corporation
of
the
greatest
city
in
the
world
to
make
themselves
hopelessly
ridiculous
they
never
hear
the
last
of
this
affair
just
look
at
the
crowds
waiting
patiently
below
there
look
at
the
flags
think
of
that
gorgeous
conveyance
of
yours
standing
outside
the
guildhall
think
of
the
assembly
inside
all
the
most
aristocratic
noble
and
distinguished
personages
in
the
land
continued
horace
piling
it
on
as
he
proceeded
all
collected
for
what
to
be
made
fools
of
by
a
jinnee
out
of
a
brass
bottle
for
their
own
sakes
they
will
preserve
silence
said
fakrash
with
a
gleam
of
unwonted
shrewdness
probably
they
would
hush
it
up
if
they
only
could
conceded
horace
but
how
they
what
are
they
to
say
what
plausible
explanation
can
they
give
besides
there
the
press
you
do
know
what
the
press
is
but
i
assure
you
its
power
is
tremendous
it
simply
impossible
to
keep
anything
secret
from
it
nowadays
it
has
eyes
and
ears
everywhere
and
a
thousand
tongues
five
minutes
after
the
doors
in
that
hall
are
unlocked
and
they
ca
keep
them
locked
longer
the
reporters
will
be
handing
in
their
special
descriptions
of
you
and
your
latest
vagaries
to
their
respective
journals
within
half
an
hour
bills
will
be
carried
through
every
quarter
of
london
bills
with
enormous
letters
scene
at
the
guildhall
end
to
a
civic
function
appearance
of
an
oriental
genie
in
the
city
of
a
guest
of
the
lord
mayor
excitement
particulars
and
by
that
time
the
story
will
have
flashed
round
the
whole
world
silence
indeed
do
you
imagine
for
a
moment
that
the
lord
mayor
or
anybody
else
concerned
however
remotely
will
ever
forget
or
be
allowed
to
forget
such
an
outrageous
incident
as
this
if
you
do
believe
me
you
mistaken
truly
it
would
be
a
terrible
thing
to
incur
the
wrath
of
the
lord
mayor
said
the
jinnee
in
troubled
accents
awful
said
horace
but
you
seem
to
have
managed
it
he
weareth
round
his
neck
a
magic
jewel
which
giveth
him
dominion
over
devils
is
it
not
so
you
know
best
said
horace
it
was
the
splendour
of
that
jewel
and
the
majesty
of
his
countenance
that
rendered
me
afraid
to
enter
his
presence
lest
he
should
recognise
me
for
what
i
am
and
command
me
to
obey
him
for
verily
his
might
is
greater
even
than
suleyman
and
his
hand
heavier
upon
such
of
the
jinn
as
fall
into
his
power
if
that
so
said
horace
i
should
strongly
advise
you
to
find
some
way
of
putting
things
straight
before
it
too
late
you
no
time
to
lose
thou
sayest
well
said
fakrash
springing
to
his
feet
and
turning
his
face
towards
cheapside
horace
shuffled
himself
along
the
ledge
in
a
seated
position
after
the
jinnee
and
looking
down
between
his
feet
could
just
see
the
tops
of
the
thin
and
rusty
trees
in
the
churchyard
the
black
and
serried
swarms
of
foreshortened
people
in
the
street
and
the
mouths
of
on
the
tiled
roofs
below
there
is
but
one
remedy
i
know
said
the
jinnee
and
it
may
be
that
i
have
lost
power
to
perform
it
yet
will
i
make
the
endeavour
and
stretching
forth
his
right
hand
towards
the
east
he
muttered
some
kind
of
command
or
invocation
horace
almost
fell
off
the
cornice
with
apprehension
of
what
might
follow
would
it
be
a
thunderbolt
a
plague
some
frightful
convulsion
of
nature
he
felt
sure
that
fakrash
would
hesitate
at
no
means
however
violent
of
burying
all
traces
of
his
blunder
in
oblivion
and
very
little
hope
that
whatever
he
did
it
would
prove
anything
but
some
worse
indiscretion
than
his
previous
performances
happily
none
of
these
extreme
measures
seemed
to
have
occurred
to
the
jinnee
though
what
followed
was
strange
and
striking
enough
for
presently
as
if
in
obedience
to
the
jinnee
weird
gesticulations
a
lurid
belt
of
fog
came
rolling
up
from
the
direction
of
the
royal
exchange
swallowing
up
building
after
building
in
its
rapid
course
one
by
one
the
guildhall
bow
church
cheapside
itself
and
the
churchyard
disappeared
and
horace
turning
his
head
to
the
left
saw
the
murky
tide
sweeping
on
westward
blotting
out
ludgate
hill
the
strand
charing
cross
and
westminster
till
at
last
he
and
fakrash
were
alone
above
a
limitless
plain
of
bituminous
cloud
the
only
living
beings
left
as
it
seemed
in
a
blank
and
silent
universe
look
again
said
fakrash
and
horace
looking
eastward
saw
the
spire
of
bow
church
rosy
once
more
the
guildhall
standing
clear
and
intact
and
the
streets
and
gradually
reappearing
only
the
flags
with
their
unrestful
shiver
and
ripple
of
colour
had
disappeared
and
with
them
the
waiting
crowds
and
the
mounted
constables
the
ordinary
traffic
of
vans
omnibuses
and
cabs
was
proceeding
as
though
it
had
never
been
interrupted
the
clank
and
jingle
of
harness
chains
the
cries
and
of
drivers
rose
with
curious
distinctness
above
the
incessant
trampling
roar
which
is
the
of
the
human
ocean
that
cloud
which
thou
sawest
said
fakrash
hath
swept
away
with
it
all
memory
of
this
affair
from
the
minds
of
every
mortal
assembled
to
do
thee
honour
see
they
go
about
their
several
businesses
and
all
the
past
incidents
are
to
them
as
though
they
had
never
been
it
was
not
often
that
horace
could
honestly
commend
any
performance
of
the
jinnee
but
at
this
he
could
not
restrain
his
admiration
by
jove
he
said
that
certainly
gets
the
lord
mayor
and
everybody
else
out
of
the
mess
as
neatly
as
possible
i
must
say
fakrash
much
the
best
thing
i
seen
you
do
yet
wait
said
the
jinnee
for
presently
thou
shalt
see
me
perform
a
yet
more
excellent
thing
there
was
a
most
unpleasant
green
glow
in
his
eyes
and
a
bristle
in
his
thin
beard
as
he
spoke
which
suddenly
made
horace
feel
uncomfortable
he
did
not
like
the
look
of
the
jinnee
at
all
i
really
think
you
done
enough
for
he
said
and
this
wind
up
here
is
rather
searching
i
sha
be
sorry
to
find
myself
on
the
ground
again
that
replied
the
jinnee
thou
shalt
assuredly
do
before
long
o
impudent
and
deceitful
wretch
and
he
laid
a
long
lean
hand
on
horace
shoulder
he
put
out
about
something
thought
ventimore
but
what
my
dear
sir
he
said
aloud
i
do
understand
this
tone
of
yours
what
have
i
done
to
offend
you
divinely
gifted
was
he
who
said
of
losing
hearts
in
consequence
of
injury
for
the
bringing
them
back
after
flight
is
difficult
excellent
said
horace
but
i
do
quite
see
the
application
the
application
explained
the
jinnee
is
that
i
am
determined
to
cast
thee
down
from
here
with
my
own
hand
horace
turned
faint
and
dizzy
for
a
moment
then
by
a
strong
effort
of
will
he
pulled
himself
together
oh
come
now
he
said
you
really
mean
that
you
know
after
all
your
kindness
you
much
too
to
be
capable
of
anything
so
atrocious
all
pity
hath
been
eradicated
from
my
heart
returned
fakrash
therefore
prepare
to
die
for
thou
art
presently
about
to
perish
in
the
most
unfortunate
manner
ventimore
could
not
repress
a
shudder
hitherto
he
had
never
been
able
to
take
fakrash
quite
seriously
in
spite
of
all
his
supernatural
powers
he
had
treated
him
with
a
tolerance
as
a
but
hopelessly
incompetent
old
foozle
that
the
jinnee
should
ever
become
malevolent
towards
him
had
never
entered
his
head
till
now
and
yet
he
undoubtedly
had
how
was
he
to
cajole
and
disarm
this
formidable
being
he
must
keep
cool
and
act
promptly
or
he
would
never
see
sylvia
again
as
he
sat
there
on
the
narrow
ledge
with
a
faint
and
not
unpleasant
smell
of
hops
saluting
his
nostrils
from
some
distant
brewery
he
tried
hard
to
collect
his
thoughts
but
could
not
he
found
himself
instead
idly
watching
the
busy
jostling
crowd
below
who
were
all
unconscious
of
the
impending
drama
so
high
above
them
just
over
the
rim
of
the
dome
he
could
see
the
opaque
white
top
of
a
lamp
on
a
shelter
where
a
pigmy
constable
stood
directing
the
traffic
would
he
look
up
if
horace
called
for
help
even
if
he
could
what
help
could
he
render
all
he
could
do
would
be
to
keep
the
crowd
back
and
send
for
a
covered
stretcher
no
he
would
dwell
on
these
horrors
he
fix
his
mind
on
some
way
of
circumventing
fakrash
how
did
the
people
in
the
arabian
nights
manage
the
fisherman
for
instance
he
persuaded
jinnee
to
return
to
the
bottle
by
pretending
to
doubt
whether
he
had
ever
really
been
inside
it
but
fakrash
though
simple
enough
in
some
respects
was
not
quite
such
a
fool
as
that
sometimes
the
jinn
could
be
mollified
and
induced
to
grant
a
reprieve
by
being
told
stories
one
inside
the
other
like
a
nest
of
oriental
boxes
unfortunately
fakrash
did
not
seem
in
the
humour
for
listening
to
apologues
and
even
if
he
were
horace
could
not
think
of
or
improvise
any
just
then
besides
he
thought
i
ca
sit
up
here
telling
him
anecdotes
for
ever
i
almost
sooner
die
still
he
remembered
that
it
was
generally
possible
to
draw
an
arabian
efreet
into
discussion
they
all
loved
argument
and
had
a
rough
conception
of
justice
i
think
fakrash
he
said
that
in
common
fairness
i
have
a
right
to
know
what
offence
i
have
committed
to
recite
thy
misdeeds
replied
the
jinnee
would
occupy
much
time
i
do
mind
that
said
horace
affably
i
can
give
you
as
long
as
you
like
i
in
no
sort
of
a
hurry
with
me
it
is
otherwise
retorted
fakrash
making
a
stride
towards
him
therefore
court
not
life
for
thy
death
hath
become
unavoidable
before
we
part
said
horace
you
wo
refuse
to
answer
one
or
two
questions
didst
thou
not
undertake
never
to
ask
any
further
favour
of
me
moreover
it
will
avail
thee
nought
for
i
am
positively
determined
to
slay
thee
i
demand
it
said
horace
in
the
most
great
name
of
the
lord
mayor
on
whom
be
peace
it
was
a
desperate
shot
but
it
took
effect
the
jinnee
quailed
visibly
ask
then
he
said
but
briefly
for
the
time
groweth
short
horace
determined
to
make
one
last
appeal
to
fakrash
sense
of
gratitude
since
it
had
always
seemed
the
dominant
trait
in
his
character
well
he
said
but
for
me
would
you
be
still
in
that
brass
bottle
that
replied
the
jinnee
is
the
very
reason
why
i
purpose
to
destroy
thee
oh
was
all
horace
could
find
to
say
at
this
most
answer
his
sheet
anchor
in
which
he
had
trusted
implicitly
had
suddenly
dragged
and
he
was
drifting
fast
to
destruction
are
there
any
other
questions
which
thou
wouldst
ask
inquired
the
jinnee
with
grim
indulgence
or
wilt
thou
encounter
thy
doom
without
further
procrastination
horace
was
determined
not
to
give
in
just
yet
he
had
a
very
bad
hand
but
he
might
as
well
play
the
game
out
and
trust
to
luck
to
gain
a
stray
trick
i
have
nearly
done
yet
he
said
and
remember
you
promised
to
answer
me
in
the
name
of
the
lord
mayor
i
will
answer
one
other
question
and
no
more
said
the
jinnee
in
an
inflexible
tone
and
ventimore
realised
that
his
fate
would
depend
upon
what
he
said
next
chapter
xviii
a
game
of
bluff
thy
second
question
o
pertinacious
one
said
the
jinnee
impatiently
he
was
standing
with
folded
arms
looking
down
on
horace
who
was
still
seated
on
the
narrow
cornice
not
daring
to
glance
below
again
lest
he
should
lose
his
head
altogether
i
coming
to
it
said
ventimore
i
want
to
know
why
you
should
propose
to
dash
me
to
pieces
in
this
barbarous
way
as
a
return
for
letting
you
out
of
that
bottle
were
you
so
comfortable
in
it
as
all
that
in
the
bottle
i
was
at
least
suffered
to
rest
and
none
molested
me
but
in
releasing
me
thou
didst
perfidiously
conceal
from
me
that
suleyman
was
dead
and
gone
and
that
there
reigneth
one
in
his
stead
mightier
a
who
afflicteth
our
race
with
labours
and
tortures
exceeding
all
the
punishments
of
suleyman
what
on
earth
have
you
got
into
your
head
now
you
ca
mean
the
lord
mayor
whom
else
said
the
jinnee
solemnly
and
though
for
this
once
by
a
device
i
have
evaded
his
vengeance
yet
do
i
know
full
well
that
either
by
virtue
of
the
magic
jewel
upon
his
breast
or
through
that
malignant
monster
with
the
myriad
ears
and
eyes
and
tongues
which
thou
callest
press
i
shall
inevitably
fall
into
his
power
before
long
for
the
life
of
him
in
spite
of
his
desperate
plight
horace
could
not
help
laughing
i
beg
your
pardon
fakrash
he
said
as
soon
as
he
could
speak
but
the
lord
mayor
it
really
too
absurd
why
he
would
hurt
a
hair
on
a
fly
head
seek
not
to
deceive
me
further
said
fakrash
furiously
didst
thou
not
inform
me
with
thy
own
mouth
that
the
spirits
of
earth
air
water
and
fire
were
subject
to
his
will
have
i
no
eyes
do
i
not
behold
from
here
the
labours
of
my
captive
brethren
what
are
those
on
yonder
bridges
but
enslaved
jinn
shrieking
and
groaning
in
clanking
fetters
and
snorting
forth
steam
as
they
drag
their
wheeled
burdens
behind
them
are
there
not
others
toiling
with
panting
efforts
through
the
sluggish
waters
others
again
imprisoned
in
lofty
pillars
from
which
the
smoke
of
their
breath
ascendeth
even
unto
heaven
doth
not
the
air
throb
and
quiver
with
their
restless
struggles
as
they
writhe
below
in
darkness
and
torment
and
thou
hast
the
shamelessness
to
pretend
that
these
things
are
done
in
the
lord
mayor
own
realms
without
his
knowledge
verily
thou
must
take
me
for
a
fool
after
all
reflected
ventimore
if
he
chooses
to
consider
that
railway
engines
and
steamers
and
machinery
generally
are
inhabited
by
so
many
jinn
time
it
not
to
my
interest
to
undeceive
him
indeed
it
quite
the
contrary
i
was
aware
the
lord
mayor
had
so
much
power
as
all
that
he
said
but
very
likely
you
right
and
if
you
so
anxious
to
keep
in
favour
with
him
it
would
be
a
great
mistake
to
kill
me
that
annoy
him
not
so
said
the
jinnee
for
i
should
declare
that
thou
hadst
spoken
slightingly
of
him
in
my
hearing
and
that
i
had
slain
thee
on
that
account
your
proper
course
said
horace
would
be
to
hand
me
over
to
him
and
let
deal
with
the
case
much
more
regular
that
may
be
said
fakrash
but
i
have
conceived
so
bitter
a
hatred
to
thee
by
reason
of
thy
insolence
and
treachery
that
i
can
not
forego
the
delight
of
slaying
thee
with
my
own
hand
ca
you
really
said
horace
on
the
verge
of
despair
and
what
will
you
do
then
replied
the
jinnee
i
shall
flee
away
to
arabia
where
i
shall
be
safe
do
you
be
too
sure
of
that
said
horace
you
see
all
those
wires
stretched
on
poles
down
there
those
are
the
pathways
of
certain
jinn
known
as
electric
currents
and
the
lord
mayor
could
send
a
message
along
them
which
would
be
at
baghdad
before
you
had
flown
farther
than
folkestone
and
i
may
mention
that
arabia
is
now
more
or
less
under
british
jurisdiction
he
was
bluffing
of
course
for
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
even
if
any
extradition
treaty
could
be
put
in
force
the
arrest
of
a
jinnee
would
be
no
easy
matter
thou
art
of
opinion
then
that
i
should
be
no
safer
in
mine
own
country
inquired
fakrash
i
swear
by
the
name
of
the
lord
mayor
to
whom
be
all
reverence
said
horace
that
there
is
no
land
you
could
fly
to
where
you
would
be
any
safer
than
you
are
here
if
i
were
but
sealed
up
in
my
bottle
once
more
said
the
jinnee
would
not
even
the
lord
mayor
have
respect
unto
the
seal
of
suleyman
and
forbear
to
disturb
me
why
of
course
he
would
cried
horace
hardly
daring
to
believe
his
ears
that
really
a
brilliant
idea
of
yours
my
dear
mr
fakrash
and
in
the
bottle
i
should
not
be
compelled
to
work
continued
the
jinnee
for
labour
of
all
kinds
hath
ever
been
abhorrent
unto
me
i
can
quite
understand
that
said
horace
sympathetically
just
imagine
your
having
to
drag
an
excursion
train
to
the
seaside
on
a
bank
holiday
or
being
condemned
to
print
off
a
cheap
comic
paper
or
even
the
when
you
might
be
leading
a
snug
and
idle
existence
in
your
bottle
if
i
were
you
i
should
go
and
get
inside
it
at
once
suppose
we
go
back
to
vincent
square
and
find
it
i
shall
return
to
the
bottle
since
in
that
alone
there
is
safety
said
the
jinnee
but
i
shall
return
alone
alone
cried
horace
you
not
going
to
leave
me
stuck
up
here
all
by
myself
by
no
means
said
the
jinnee
have
i
not
said
that
i
am
about
to
cast
thee
to
perdition
too
long
have
i
delayed
in
the
accomplishment
of
this
duty
once
more
horace
gave
himself
up
for
lost
which
was
doubly
bitter
just
when
he
had
begun
to
consider
that
the
danger
was
past
but
even
then
he
was
determined
to
fight
to
the
last
one
moment
he
said
of
course
if
you
set
your
heart
on
pitching
me
over
you
must
only
i
may
be
quite
mistaken
but
i
do
quite
see
how
you
are
going
to
manage
the
rest
of
your
programme
without
me
that
all
o
deficient
in
intelligence
cried
the
jinnee
what
assistance
canst
thou
render
me
well
said
horace
of
course
you
can
get
into
the
bottle
alone
that
simple
enough
but
the
difficulty
i
see
is
this
are
you
quite
sure
you
can
put
the
cap
on
yourself
from
the
you
know
if
he
can
he
thought
i
done
for
that
began
the
jinnee
with
his
usual
confidence
will
be
the
easiest
of
nay
he
corrected
himself
there
be
things
that
not
even
the
jinn
themselves
can
accomplish
and
one
of
them
is
to
seal
a
vessel
while
remaining
in
it
i
am
indebted
to
thee
for
reminding
me
thereof
not
at
all
said
ventimore
i
shall
be
delighted
to
come
and
seal
you
up
comfortably
myself
again
thou
speakest
folly
exclaimed
the
jinnee
how
canst
thou
seal
me
up
after
i
have
dashed
thee
into
a
thousand
pieces
that
said
horace
with
all
the
urbanity
he
could
command
is
precisely
the
difficulty
i
was
trying
to
convey
there
will
be
no
difficulty
for
as
soon
as
i
am
in
the
bottle
i
shall
summon
certain
inferior
efreets
and
they
will
replace
the
seal
when
you
are
once
in
the
bottle
said
horace
at
a
venture
you
probably
wo
be
in
a
position
to
summon
anybody
i
get
into
the
bottle
then
said
the
jinnee
impatiently
thou
dost
but
juggle
with
words
but
about
those
efreets
persisted
horace
you
know
what
efreets
how
can
you
be
sure
that
when
they
got
you
in
the
bottle
they
wo
hand
you
over
to
the
lord
mayor
i
should
trust
them
myself
but
of
course
you
know
best
whom
shall
i
trust
then
said
fakrash
frowning
i
sure
i
do
know
it
rather
a
pity
you
so
determined
to
destroy
me
because
as
it
happens
i
just
the
one
person
living
who
could
be
depended
on
to
seal
you
up
and
keep
your
secret
however
that
your
affair
after
all
why
should
i
care
what
becomes
of
you
i
sha
be
there
even
at
this
hour
said
the
jinnee
undecidedly
i
might
find
it
in
my
heart
to
spare
thee
were
i
but
sure
that
thou
wouldst
be
faithful
unto
me
i
should
have
thought
i
was
more
to
be
trusted
than
one
of
your
beastly
efreets
said
horace
with
indifference
but
never
mind
i
do
know
that
i
care
after
all
i
nothing
particular
to
live
for
now
you
ruined
me
pretty
thoroughly
and
you
may
as
well
finish
your
work
i
a
good
mind
to
jump
over
and
save
you
the
trouble
perhaps
when
you
see
me
bouncing
down
that
dome
you
be
sorry
refrain
from
rashness
said
the
jinnee
hastily
without
suspecting
that
ventimore
had
no
serious
intention
of
carrying
out
his
threat
if
thou
wilt
do
as
thou
art
bidden
i
will
not
only
pardon
thee
but
grant
thee
all
that
thou
desirest
take
me
back
to
vincent
square
first
said
horace
this
is
not
the
place
to
discuss
business
thou
sayest
rightly
replied
the
jinnee
hold
fast
to
my
sleeve
and
i
will
transport
thee
to
thine
abode
not
till
you
promise
to
play
fair
said
horace
pausing
on
the
brink
of
the
ledge
remember
if
you
let
me
go
now
you
drop
the
only
friend
you
got
in
the
world
may
i
be
thy
ransom
replied
fakrash
there
shall
not
be
harmed
a
hair
of
thy
head
even
then
horace
had
his
misgivings
but
as
there
was
no
other
way
of
getting
off
that
cornice
he
decided
to
take
the
risk
and
as
it
proved
he
acted
judiciously
for
the
jinnee
flew
to
vincent
square
with
honourable
precision
and
dropped
him
neatly
into
the
armchair
in
which
he
had
little
hoped
ever
to
find
himself
again
i
have
brought
thee
hither
said
fakrash
and
yet
i
am
persuaded
that
thou
art
even
now
devising
treachery
against
me
and
wilt
betray
me
if
thou
canst
horace
was
about
to
assure
him
once
more
that
no
one
could
be
more
anxious
than
himself
to
see
him
safely
back
in
his
bottle
when
he
recollected
that
it
was
impolitic
to
appear
too
eager
after
the
way
you
behaved
he
said
i
not
at
all
sure
that
i
ought
to
help
you
still
i
said
i
would
on
certain
conditions
and
i
keep
my
word
conditions
thundered
the
jinnee
wilt
thou
bargain
with
me
yet
further
my
excellent
friend
said
horace
quietly
you
know
perfectly
well
that
you
ca
get
yourself
safely
sealed
up
again
in
that
bottle
without
my
assistance
if
you
do
like
my
terms
and
prefer
to
take
your
chance
of
finding
an
efreet
who
is
willing
to
brave
the
lord
mayor
well
you
only
to
say
so
i
have
loaded
thee
with
all
manner
of
riches
and
favours
and
i
will
bestow
no
more
upon
thee
said
the
jinnee
sullenly
nay
in
token
of
my
displeasure
i
will
deprive
thee
even
of
such
gifts
as
thou
hast
retained
he
pointed
his
grey
forefinger
at
ventimore
whose
turban
and
jewelled
robes
instantly
shrivelled
into
cobwebs
and
tinder
and
fluttered
to
the
carpet
in
filmy
shreds
leaving
him
in
nothing
but
his
underclothing
that
only
shows
what
a
nasty
temper
you
in
said
horace
blandly
and
does
annoy
me
in
the
least
if
you
excuse
me
i
go
and
put
on
some
things
i
can
feel
more
at
home
in
and
perhaps
by
the
time
i
return
you
have
cooled
down
he
slipped
on
some
clothes
hurriedly
and
the
now
fakrash
he
said
we
have
this
out
you
talk
of
having
loaded
me
with
benefits
you
seem
to
consider
i
ought
to
be
grateful
to
you
in
heaven
name
for
what
i
been
as
forbearing
as
possible
all
this
time
because
i
gave
you
credit
for
meaning
well
now
i
speak
plainly
i
told
you
from
the
first
and
i
tell
you
now
that
i
want
no
riches
nor
honours
from
you
the
one
real
good
turn
you
did
me
was
bringing
me
that
client
and
you
spoilt
that
because
you
would
insist
on
building
the
palace
yourself
instead
of
leaving
it
to
me
as
for
the
rest
here
am
i
a
ruined
and
discredited
man
with
a
client
who
probably
supposes
i
in
league
with
the
devil
with
the
girl
i
love
and
might
have
married
believing
that
i
have
left
her
to
marry
a
princess
and
her
father
unable
ever
to
forgive
me
for
having
seen
him
as
a
mule
in
short
i
in
such
a
mess
all
round
that
i
care
two
straws
whether
i
live
or
die
what
is
all
this
to
me
said
the
jinnee
only
this
that
unless
you
can
see
your
way
to
putting
things
straight
for
me
i
hanged
if
i
take
the
trouble
to
seal
you
up
in
that
bottle
how
am
to
put
things
straight
for
thee
cried
fakrash
peevishly
if
you
could
make
all
those
people
entirely
forget
that
affair
in
the
guildhall
you
can
make
my
friends
forget
the
brass
bottle
and
everything
connected
with
it
ca
you
there
would
be
no
difficulty
in
that
fakrash
admitted
well
do
it
and
i
swear
to
seal
you
up
in
the
bottle
exactly
as
if
you
had
never
been
out
of
it
and
pitch
you
into
the
deepest
part
of
the
thames
where
no
one
will
ever
disturb
you
first
produce
the
bottle
then
said
fakrash
for
i
can
not
believe
but
that
thou
hast
some
lurking
guile
in
thy
heart
i
ring
for
my
landlady
and
have
the
bottle
brought
up
said
horace
perhaps
that
will
satisfy
you
stay
you
better
not
let
her
see
you
i
will
render
myself
invisible
said
the
jinnee
suiting
the
action
to
his
words
but
beware
lest
thou
play
me
false
his
voice
continued
for
i
shall
hear
thee
so
you
come
in
mr
ventimore
said
rapkin
as
she
entered
and
without
the
furrin
gentleman
i
surprised
and
so
was
rapkin
the
same
to
see
you
ridin
off
this
morning
in
the
gorgious
chariot
and
and
dressed
up
that
lovely
upon
it
i
says
to
rapkin
i
says
upon
it
ventimore
be
sent
for
to
buckinham
pallis
if
it
ai
windsor
castle
never
mind
that
now
said
horace
impatiently
i
want
that
brass
bottle
i
bought
the
other
day
bring
it
up
at
once
please
i
thought
you
said
the
other
day
you
never
wanted
to
set
eyes
on
it
again
and
i
was
to
do
as
i
pleased
with
it
sir
well
i
changed
my
mind
so
let
me
have
it
quick
i
sure
i
very
sorry
sir
but
that
you
ca
because
rapkin
not
wishful
to
have
the
place
lumbered
up
with
rubbish
disposed
of
it
last
night
to
a
gentleman
as
keeps
a
rag
and
bone
emporium
off
the
bridge
road
and
was
the
most
he
give
for
it
sir
give
me
his
name
said
horace
dilger
sir
emanuel
dilger
when
rapkin
comes
in
i
sure
he
go
round
with
pleasure
and
see
about
it
if
required
i
go
round
myself
said
horace
it
all
right
rapkin
quite
a
natural
mistake
on
your
part
but
but
i
happen
to
want
the
bottle
again
you
need
stay
o
thou
and
one
said
the
jinnee
after
she
had
gone
as
he
reappeared
to
view
did
i
not
foresee
that
thou
wouldst
deal
crookedly
restore
unto
me
my
bottle
i
go
and
get
it
at
once
said
horace
i
sha
be
five
minutes
and
he
prepared
to
go
thou
shalt
not
leave
this
house
cried
fakrash
for
i
perceive
plainly
that
this
is
but
a
device
of
thine
to
escape
and
betray
me
to
the
press
devil
if
you
ca
see
said
horace
angrily
that
i
quite
as
anxious
to
see
you
safely
back
in
that
confounded
bottle
as
ever
you
can
be
to
get
there
you
must
be
pretty
dense
you
understand
the
sold
and
i
ca
buy
it
back
without
going
out
do
be
so
infernally
unreasonable
go
then
said
the
jinnee
and
i
will
await
thy
return
here
but
know
this
that
if
thou
delayest
long
or
returnest
without
my
bottle
i
shall
know
that
thou
art
a
traitor
and
will
visit
thee
and
those
who
are
dear
to
thee
with
the
most
unpleasant
punishments
i
be
back
in
half
an
hour
at
most
said
horace
feeling
that
this
would
allow
him
ample
margin
and
thankful
that
it
did
not
occur
to
fakrash
to
go
in
person
he
put
on
his
hat
and
hurried
off
in
the
gathering
dusk
he
had
some
little
trouble
in
finding
dilger
establishment
which
was
a
dirty
dusty
little
place
in
a
back
street
with
a
few
deplorable
old
chairs
rickety
washstands
and
rusty
fenders
outside
and
the
interior
almost
completely
blocked
by
piles
of
dingy
mattresses
empty
tarnished
and
cracked
mirrors
broken
lamps
damaged
and
everything
else
which
one
would
imagine
could
have
no
possible
value
for
any
human
being
but
in
all
this
collection
of
worthless
curios
the
brass
bottle
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
ventimore
went
in
and
found
a
youth
of
about
thirteen
straining
his
eyes
in
the
fading
light
over
one
of
those
halfpenny
humorous
journals
which
thanks
to
an
improved
system
of
education
at
least
eighty
per
cent
of
our
juvenile
population
are
now
enabled
to
appreciate
i
want
to
see
dilger
he
began
you
ca
said
the
youth
he
ai
in
he
attending
of
an
auction
when
he
be
in
do
you
know
might
be
back
to
his
tea
but
i
was
to
expect
him
not
before
supper
you
do
happen
to
have
any
old
metal
bottles
copper
or
or
brass
would
do
for
sale
you
do
git
at
me
like
that
bottles
is
made
o
glorss
well
a
jar
then
a
big
brass
pot
anything
of
that
kind
do
keep
said
the
boy
and
buried
himself
once
more
in
his
copy
of
spicy
sniggers
i
just
look
round
said
horace
and
began
to
poke
about
with
a
sinking
heart
and
a
horrid
dread
that
he
might
have
come
to
the
wrong
shop
for
the
big
vessel
certainly
did
not
seem
to
be
there
at
last
to
his
unspeakable
joy
he
discovered
it
under
a
piece
of
tattered
drugget
why
this
is
the
sort
of
thing
i
meant
he
said
feeling
in
his
pocket
and
discovering
that
he
had
exactly
a
sovereign
how
much
do
you
want
for
it
i
dunno
said
the
boy
i
do
mind
three
shillings
said
horace
who
did
not
wish
to
appear
too
keen
at
first
i
tell
the
when
he
comes
in
was
the
reply
and
you
can
look
in
later
i
want
it
at
once
insisted
horace
come
i
give
you
for
it
it
more
than
it
wurf
replied
the
candid
youth
perhaps
said
horace
but
i
rather
pressed
for
time
if
change
this
sovereign
i
take
the
bottle
away
with
me
you
seem
uncommon
anxious
to
get
on
it
mister
said
the
boy
with
sudden
suspicion
nonsense
said
horace
i
live
close
by
and
i
thought
i
might
as
well
take
it
that
all
oh
if
that
all
you
can
wait
till
the
in
i
i
may
be
passing
this
way
again
for
some
time
said
horace
bound
to
be
if
you
live
close
by
and
the
provoking
youth
returned
to
his
sniggers
do
you
call
this
attending
to
your
master
business
said
horace
listen
to
me
you
young
rascal
i
give
you
five
shillings
for
it
you
not
going
to
be
fool
enough
to
refuse
an
offer
like
that
i
ai
goin
to
be
fool
enough
to
refuse
it
nor
yet
i
ai
goin
to
be
fool
enough
to
take
it
i
only
to
see
as
nobody
come
in
and
sneak
fings
i
ai
got
no
authority
to
sell
anyfink
and
i
do
know
the
proice
o
nuffink
so
there
you
it
take
the
five
shillings
said
horace
and
if
it
too
little
come
round
and
settle
with
your
master
later
i
thought
you
said
you
was
likely
to
be
porsin
again
no
mister
you
do
kid
me
that
way
horace
had
a
mad
impulse
to
snatch
up
the
precious
bottle
then
and
there
and
make
off
with
it
and
might
have
yielded
to
the
temptation
with
disastrous
consequences
had
not
an
elderly
man
entered
the
shop
at
that
moment
he
was
bent
and
wore
rather
more
fluff
and
flue
upon
his
person
than
most
people
would
consider
necessary
but
he
came
in
with
a
certain
air
of
authority
nevertheless
dilger
sir
piped
the
youth
a
gent
took
a
fancy
to
this
brass
pot
o
yours
says
he
it
five
shillings
he
got
to
but
i
told
him
he
to
wait
till
you
come
in
quite
right
my
lad
said
dilger
cocking
a
watery
but
sharp
old
eye
at
horace
five
shillings
ah
sir
you
ca
know
much
about
these
hold
brass
antiquities
to
make
an
orfer
like
that
i
know
as
much
as
most
people
said
horace
but
let
us
say
six
shillings
could
be
done
sir
could
indeed
why
i
give
a
pound
for
it
myself
at
christie
as
sure
as
i
standin
in
the
presence
o
my
maker
and
you
a
sinner
he
declared
impressively
if
rather
ambiguously
your
memory
is
not
quite
accurate
said
horace
you
bought
it
last
night
from
a
man
of
the
name
of
rapkin
who
lets
lodgings
in
vincent
square
and
you
paid
exactly
half
a
crown
for
it
if
you
say
so
i
dare
say
it
correct
sir
said
dilger
without
exhibiting
the
least
confusion
and
if
i
did
buy
it
off
rapkin
he
a
respectable
party
and
ai
likely
to
have
come
by
it
dishonest
i
never
said
he
did
what
will
you
take
for
the
thing
well
just
look
at
the
work
in
it
they
do
turn
out
the
like
o
that
nowadays
dutch
that
is
what
they
used
for
to
put
their
milk
and
in
damn
it
said
horace
completely
losing
his
temper
know
what
it
was
used
for
you
tell
me
what
you
want
for
it
i
could
let
a
curiosity
like
that
go
a
penny
under
thirty
shillings
said
dilger
affectionately
it
would
be
myself
i
give
you
a
sovereign
for
it
there
said
horace
you
know
best
what
profit
that
represents
that
my
last
word
last
word
to
that
sir
is
good
hevenin
said
the
worthy
man
good
evening
then
said
horace
and
walked
out
of
the
shop
rather
to
bring
dilger
to
terms
than
because
he
really
meant
to
abandon
the
bottle
for
he
dared
not
go
back
without
it
and
he
had
nothing
about
him
just
then
on
which
he
could
raise
the
extra
ten
shillings
supposing
the
dealer
refused
to
trust
him
for
the
balance
and
the
time
was
growing
dangerously
short
fortunately
the
ruse
succeeded
for
dilger
ran
out
after
him
and
laid
an
unwashed
claw
upon
his
do
go
mister
he
said
i
like
to
do
business
if
i
can
though
my
word
and
honour
a
sovereign
for
a
work
o
art
like
that
well
just
for
luck
and
bein
my
birthday
we
call
it
a
deal
horace
handed
over
the
coin
which
left
him
with
a
few
pence
there
ought
to
be
a
lid
or
stopper
of
some
sort
he
said
suddenly
what
have
you
done
with
that
no
sir
there
you
mistook
you
are
indeed
i
do
assure
you
you
never
see
a
pot
of
this
partickler
pattern
with
a
lid
to
it
never
oh
do
you
though
said
horace
i
know
better
never
mind
he
said
as
he
recollected
that
the
seal
was
in
fakrash
possession
take
it
as
it
is
do
trouble
to
wrap
it
up
i
in
rather
a
hurry
it
was
almost
dark
when
he
got
back
to
his
rooms
where
he
found
the
jinnee
shaking
with
mingled
rage
and
apprehension
no
welcome
to
thee
he
cried
dilatory
dog
that
thou
art
hadst
thou
delayed
another
minute
i
would
have
called
down
some
calamity
upon
thee
well
you
need
not
trouble
yourself
to
do
that
now
returned
ventimore
here
your
bottle
and
you
can
creep
into
it
as
soon
as
you
please
but
the
seal
shrieked
the
jinnee
what
hast
thou
done
with
the
seal
which
was
upon
the
bottle
why
you
got
it
yourself
of
course
said
horace
in
one
of
your
pockets
o
thou
of
base
antecedents
howled
fakrash
shaking
out
his
flowing
draperies
how
should
have
the
seal
this
is
but
a
fresh
device
of
thine
to
undo
me
do
talk
rubbish
retorted
horace
you
made
the
professor
give
it
up
to
you
yesterday
you
must
have
lost
it
somewhere
or
other
never
mind
i
get
a
large
cork
or
bung
which
will
do
just
as
well
and
i
lots
of
i
will
have
no
seal
but
the
seal
of
suleyman
declared
the
jinnee
for
with
no
other
will
there
be
security
verily
i
believe
that
that
accursed
sage
thy
friend
hath
contrived
by
some
cunning
to
get
the
seal
once
more
into
his
hands
i
will
go
at
once
to
his
abode
and
compel
him
to
restore
it
i
would
said
horace
feeling
extremely
uneasy
for
it
was
evidently
a
much
simpler
thing
to
let
a
jinnee
out
of
a
bottle
than
to
get
him
in
again
he
quite
incapable
of
taking
it
and
if
you
go
out
now
you
only
make
a
fuss
and
attract
the
attention
of
the
press
which
i
thought
you
rather
wanted
to
avoid
i
shall
attire
myself
in
the
garments
of
a
mortal
even
those
i
assumed
on
a
former
occasion
said
fakrash
and
as
he
spoke
his
outer
robes
modernised
into
a
thus
shall
i
escape
attention
wait
one
moment
said
horace
what
is
that
bulge
in
your
of
a
truth
said
the
jinnee
looking
relieved
but
not
a
little
foolish
as
he
extracted
the
object
it
is
indeed
the
seal
you
in
such
a
hurry
to
think
the
worst
of
everybody
you
see
said
horace
now
try
to
carry
away
with
you
into
your
seclusion
a
better
opinion
of
human
nature
perdition
to
all
the
people
of
this
age
cried
fakrash
his
green
robe
and
turban
for
i
now
put
no
faith
in
human
beings
and
would
afflict
them
all
were
not
the
lord
mayor
on
whom
be
peace
mightier
than
i
therefore
while
it
is
yet
time
take
thou
the
stopper
and
swear
that
after
i
am
in
this
bottle
thou
wilt
seal
it
as
before
and
cast
it
into
deep
waters
where
no
eye
will
look
upon
it
more
with
all
the
pleasure
in
the
world
said
horace
only
you
must
keep
part
of
the
bargain
first
you
will
kindly
obliterate
all
recollection
of
yourself
and
the
brass
bottle
from
the
minds
of
every
human
being
who
has
had
anything
to
do
with
you
or
it
not
so
objected
the
jinnee
for
thus
wouldst
thou
forget
thy
compact
oh
very
well
leave
out
then
said
horace
not
that
anything
could
make
me
forget
fakrash
swept
his
right
hand
round
in
a
half
circle
it
is
accomplished
he
said
all
recollection
of
myself
and
yonder
bottle
is
now
erased
from
the
memories
of
every
one
but
thyself
but
how
about
my
client
said
horace
i
ca
afford
to
lose
you
know
he
shall
return
unto
thee
said
the
jinnee
trembling
with
impatience
now
perform
thy
share
horace
had
triumphed
it
had
been
a
long
and
desperate
duel
with
this
singular
being
who
was
at
once
so
crafty
and
so
childlike
so
credulous
and
so
suspicious
so
benevolent
and
so
malign
again
and
again
he
had
despaired
of
victory
but
he
had
won
at
last
in
another
minute
or
so
this
formidable
jinnee
would
be
safely
bottled
once
more
and
powerless
to
intermeddle
and
plague
him
for
the
future
and
yet
in
the
very
moment
of
triumph
quixotic
as
such
scruples
may
seem
to
some
ventimore
conscience
smote
him
he
could
not
help
a
certain
pity
for
the
old
creature
who
was
shaking
there
convulsively
prepared
to
his
rather
than
incur
a
wholly
imaginary
doom
fakrash
had
aged
visibly
within
the
last
hour
now
he
looked
even
older
than
his
three
thousand
and
odd
years
true
he
had
led
horace
a
fearful
life
of
late
but
at
first
at
least
his
intentions
had
been
good
his
gratitude
if
mistaken
in
its
form
was
the
sign
of
a
generous
disposition
not
every
jinnee
surely
would
have
endeavoured
to
press
untold
millions
and
honours
and
dignities
of
all
kinds
upon
him
in
return
for
a
service
which
most
mortals
would
have
considered
amply
repaid
by
a
brace
of
birds
and
an
invitation
to
an
evening
party
and
how
was
horace
treating
he
was
taking
what
in
his
heart
he
felt
to
be
a
rather
mean
advantage
of
the
jinnee
ignorance
of
modern
life
to
cajole
him
into
returning
to
his
captivity
why
not
suffer
him
to
live
out
the
brief
remainder
of
his
years
for
he
could
hardly
last
more
than
another
century
or
two
at
most
in
freedom
fakrash
had
learnt
his
lesson
he
was
not
likely
to
interfere
again
in
human
affairs
he
might
find
his
way
back
to
the
palace
of
the
mountain
of
the
clouds
and
end
his
days
there
in
peaceful
enjoyment
of
the
society
of
such
of
the
jinn
as
might
still
survive
unbottled
so
obeying
against
his
own
interests
some
kindlier
impulse
horace
made
an
effort
to
deter
the
jinnee
who
was
already
hovering
in
air
above
the
neck
of
the
bottle
in
a
swirl
of
revolving
draperies
like
some
blundering
old
bee
vainly
endeavouring
to
hit
the
opening
into
his
hive
fakrash
he
cried
before
you
go
any
farther
listen
to
me
there
no
real
necessity
after
all
for
you
to
go
back
to
your
bottle
if
you
only
wait
a
little
but
the
jinnee
who
had
now
swelled
to
gigantic
proportions
and
whose
form
and
features
were
only
dimly
recognisable
through
the
wreaths
of
black
vapour
in
which
he
was
involved
answered
him
from
his
pillar
of
smoke
in
a
terrible
voice
wouldst
thou
still
persuade
me
to
linger
he
cried
hold
thy
peace
and
be
ready
to
fulfil
thine
undertaking
but
look
here
persisted
horace
i
should
feel
such
a
brute
if
i
sealed
you
up
without
telling
you
the
whirling
and
roaring
column
in
shape
like
an
inverted
cone
was
being
fast
sucked
down
into
the
vessel
till
only
a
but
highly
infuriated
head
was
left
above
the
neck
of
the
bottle
must
i
tarry
it
cried
till
the
lord
mayor
arrive
with
his
memlooks
and
the
hour
of
safety
is
expired
by
my
head
if
thou
delayest
another
instant
i
will
put
no
more
faith
in
thee
and
i
will
come
forth
once
more
and
afflict
thee
and
thy
friends
ay
and
all
the
dwellers
in
this
accursed
city
with
the
most
painful
and
calamities
and
with
these
words
the
head
sank
into
the
bottle
with
a
loud
clap
resembling
thunder
horace
hesitated
no
longer
the
jinnee
himself
had
absolved
him
from
all
further
scruples
to
imperil
sylvia
and
her
parents
not
to
mention
all
london
out
of
consideration
for
one
obstinate
and
obnoxious
old
demon
would
clearly
be
carrying
sentiment
much
too
far
accordingly
he
made
a
rush
for
the
jar
and
slipped
the
metal
cover
over
the
mouth
of
the
neck
which
was
so
hot
that
it
blistered
his
fingers
and
seizing
the
poker
he
hammered
down
the
secret
catch
until
the
lid
fitted
as
closely
as
suleyman
himself
could
have
required
then
he
stuffed
the
bottle
into
a
adding
a
few
coals
to
give
it
extra
weight
and
toiled
off
with
it
to
the
nearest
steamboat
pier
where
he
spent
his
remaining
pence
in
purchasing
a
ticket
to
the
temple
next
day
the
following
paragraph
appeared
in
one
of
the
evening
papers
which
probably
had
more
space
than
usual
at
its
disposal
singular
occurrence
on
a
penny
steamer
a
gentleman
on
board
one
of
the
thames
steamboats
so
we
are
informed
by
an
met
with
a
somewhat
ludicrous
mishap
yesterday
evening
it
appears
that
he
had
with
him
a
small
portmanteau
or
large
which
he
was
supporting
on
the
rail
of
the
stern
bulwark
just
as
the
vessel
was
opposite
the
savoy
hotel
he
incautiously
raised
his
hand
to
the
brim
of
his
hat
thereby
releasing
hold
of
the
bag
which
overbalanced
itself
and
fell
into
the
deepest
part
of
the
river
where
it
instantly
sank
the
owner
whose
carelessness
occasioned
considerable
amusement
to
passengers
in
his
immediate
vicinity
appeared
no
little
disconcerted
by
the
oversight
and
was
not
unnaturally
reticent
as
to
the
amount
of
his
loss
though
he
was
understood
to
state
that
the
bag
contained
nothing
of
any
great
value
however
this
may
be
he
has
probably
learnt
a
lesson
which
will
render
him
more
careful
in
future
the
epilogue
on
a
certain
evening
in
may
horace
ventimore
dined
in
a
private
room
at
the
savoy
as
one
of
the
guests
of
samuel
wackerbath
in
fact
he
might
almost
be
said
to
be
the
guest
of
the
evening
as
the
dinner
was
given
by
way
of
celebrating
the
completion
of
the
host
new
country
house
at
lipsfield
of
which
horace
was
the
architect
and
also
to
congratulate
him
on
his
approaching
marriage
which
was
fixed
to
take
place
early
in
the
following
month
with
miss
sylvia
futvoye
quite
a
small
and
friendly
party
said
wackerbath
looking
round
on
his
numerous
sons
and
daughters
as
he
greeted
horace
in
the
only
ourselves
you
see
miss
futvoye
a
young
lady
with
whom
you
are
fairly
well
acquainted
and
her
people
and
an
old
schoolfellow
of
mine
and
his
wife
who
are
not
yet
arrived
he
a
man
of
considerable
eminence
he
added
with
a
roll
of
reflected
importance
in
his
voice
quite
worth
your
cultivating
sir
lawrence
pountney
his
name
is
i
do
know
if
you
remember
him
but
he
discharged
the
onerous
duties
of
lord
mayor
of
london
the
year
before
last
and
acquitted
himself
very
creditably
in
fact
he
got
a
baronetcy
for
it
as
the
year
before
last
was
the
year
in
which
horace
had
paid
his
involuntary
visit
to
the
guildhall
he
was
able
to
reply
with
truth
that
he
remember
sir
lawrence
he
was
not
altogether
comfortable
when
the
was
announced
for
it
would
have
been
more
than
awkward
if
sir
lawrence
had
chanced
to
remember
fortunately
he
gave
no
sign
that
he
did
so
though
his
manner
was
graciousness
itself
delighted
my
dear
ventimore
he
said
pressing
horace
hand
almost
as
warmly
as
he
had
done
that
october
day
of
the
dais
most
delighted
to
make
your
acquaintance
i
am
always
glad
to
meet
a
rising
young
man
and
i
hear
that
the
house
you
have
designed
for
my
old
friend
here
is
a
perfect
palace
a
marvel
sir
i
knew
he
was
my
man
declared
wackerbath
as
horace
modestly
disclaimed
sir
lawrence
compliment
you
remember
pountney
my
dear
fellow
that
day
when
we
were
crossing
westminster
bridge
together
and
i
was
telling
you
i
thought
of
building
to
one
of
the
leading
men
an
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
you
said
you
be
sure
of
getting
your
money
worth
but
i
said
i
like
to
choose
for
myself
to
ah
exercise
my
own
judgment
in
these
matters
and
there
a
young
fellow
i
have
in
my
eye
who
beat
all
if
he
given
the
chance
i
off
to
see
him
now
and
off
i
went
to
great
cloister
street
for
he
had
those
palatial
offices
of
his
in
victoria
street
at
that
time
without
losing
another
instant
and
dropped
in
on
him
with
my
little
commission
did
i
ventimore
you
did
indeed
said
horace
wondering
how
far
these
reminiscences
would
go
and
continued
wackerbath
patting
horace
on
the
shoulder
from
that
day
to
this
i
never
had
a
moment
reason
to
regret
it
worked
in
perfect
sympathy
his
ideas
coincided
with
mine
i
think
he
found
that
i
met
him
so
to
speak
on
all
fours
ventimore
assented
though
it
struck
him
that
a
happier
expression
might
and
would
have
been
employed
if
his
client
had
remembered
one
particular
interview
in
which
he
had
not
figured
to
advantage
they
went
in
to
dinner
in
a
room
sumptuously
decorated
with
panels
of
brocade
and
softly
shaded
lamps
and
screens
of
gilded
leather
through
the
centre
of
the
table
rose
a
tall
palm
its
boughs
hung
with
small
electric
globes
like
magic
fruits
this
palm
said
the
professor
who
was
in
high
good
humour
really
gives
quite
an
oriental
look
to
the
table
personally
i
think
we
might
reproduce
the
arabian
style
of
decoration
and
arrangement
generally
in
our
homes
with
great
advantage
i
often
wonder
it
never
occurred
to
my
future
there
to
turn
his
talents
in
that
direction
and
design
an
oriental
interior
for
himself
nothing
more
comfortable
and
luxurious
for
a
bachelor
purposes
i
sure
said
his
wife
horace
managed
to
make
himself
quite
comfortable
enough
as
it
was
he
has
the
most
delightful
rooms
in
vincent
square
ventimore
heard
her
remark
to
sir
lawrence
i
shall
never
forget
the
first
time
we
dined
there
just
after
my
daughter
and
he
were
engaged
i
was
quite
astonished
everything
was
so
perfect
quite
simple
you
know
but
ingeniously
arranged
and
his
landlady
such
an
excellent
cook
too
still
of
course
in
many
ways
it
will
be
nicer
for
him
to
have
a
home
of
his
own
with
such
a
beautiful
and
charming
companion
to
share
it
with
said
sir
lawrence
in
his
most
florid
manner
the
ah
poorest
home
would
prove
a
paradise
indeed
and
i
suppose
now
my
dear
young
lady
he
added
raising
his
voice
to
address
sylvia
you
are
busy
making
your
future
abode
as
exquisite
as
taste
and
research
can
render
it
ransacking
all
the
furniture
shops
in
london
for
treasures
and
going
about
to
auctions
or
do
you
ah
delegate
that
department
to
mr
ventimore
i
do
go
about
to
old
furniture
shops
sir
lawrence
she
said
but
not
auctions
i
afraid
i
should
only
get
just
the
thing
i
did
want
if
i
tried
to
bid
and
she
added
in
a
lower
voice
turning
to
horace
i
do
believe
would
be
a
bit
more
successful
horace
what
makes
you
say
that
sylvia
he
asked
with
a
start
why
do
you
mean
to
say
you
forgotten
how
you
went
to
that
auction
for
papa
and
came
away
without
having
managed
to
get
a
single
thing
she
said
what
a
short
memory
you
must
have
there
was
only
tender
mockery
in
her
eyes
absolutely
no
recollection
of
the
sinister
purchase
he
had
made
at
that
sale
or
how
nearly
it
had
separated
them
for
ever
so
he
hastened
to
admit
that
perhaps
he
had
been
particularly
successful
at
the
auction
in
question
sir
lawrence
next
addressed
him
across
the
table
i
was
just
telling
futvoye
he
said
how
much
i
regretted
that
i
had
not
the
privilege
of
your
acquaintance
during
my
year
of
office
a
lord
mayor
as
you
doubtless
know
has
exceptional
facilities
for
exercising
hospitality
and
it
would
have
afforded
me
real
pleasure
if
your
first
visit
to
the
guildhall
could
have
been
paid
under
my
hm
ha
auspices
you
are
very
kind
said
horace
very
much
on
his
guard
i
could
not
wish
to
pay
it
under
better
i
flatter
myself
said
the
mayor
that
while
in
office
i
did
my
humble
best
to
maintain
the
traditions
of
the
city
and
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
have
the
honour
of
receiving
more
than
the
average
number
of
celebrities
as
guests
but
i
had
one
great
disappointment
i
must
tell
you
it
had
always
been
a
dream
of
mine
that
it
might
fall
to
my
lot
to
present
some
distinguished
with
the
freedom
of
the
city
by
some
curious
chance
when
the
opportunity
seemed
about
to
occur
the
thing
was
put
off
and
i
missed
it
missed
it
by
the
nearest
ah
well
sir
lawrence
said
ventimore
one
ca
have
for
my
part
put
in
lady
pountney
who
had
only
caught
a
word
or
two
of
her
husband
remarks
what
miss
most
is
having
the
sentinels
present
arms
whenever
i
went
out
for
a
drive
they
did
it
so
nicely
and
respectfully
i
confess
i
enjoyed
that
my
husband
never
cared
much
for
it
indeed
he
would
even
use
the
state
coach
unless
he
was
absolutely
obliged
he
was
as
obstinate
as
a
mule
about
it
i
see
lady
pountney
the
professor
put
in
that
you
share
the
common
prejudice
against
mules
it
quite
a
mistaken
one
the
mule
has
never
been
properly
appreciated
in
this
country
he
is
really
the
gentlest
and
most
docile
of
creatures
i
ca
say
i
like
them
myself
said
lady
pountney
such
a
mongrel
sort
of
animal
neither
one
thing
nor
the
other
and
they
hideous
too
anthony
added
his
wife
and
not
at
all
clever
there
you
mistaken
my
dear
said
the
professor
they
are
capable
of
almost
human
intelligence
i
have
had
considerable
personal
experience
of
what
a
mule
can
do
he
informed
lady
pountney
who
seemed
still
incredulous
more
than
most
people
indeed
and
i
can
assure
you
my
dear
lady
pountney
that
they
readily
adapt
themselves
to
almost
any
environment
and
will
endure
the
greatest
hardships
without
exhibiting
any
signs
of
distress
i
see
by
your
expression
ventimore
that
you
do
agree
with
me
eh
horace
had
to
set
his
teeth
hard
for
a
moment
lest
he
should
disgrace
himself
by
a
peal
of
untimely
mirth
but
by
a
strong
effort
of
will
he
managed
to
command
his
muscles
well
sir
he
said
i
only
chanced
to
come
into
close
contact
with
one
mule
in
my
life
and
frankly
i
no
desire
to
repeat
the
experience
you
happened
to
come
upon
an
unfavourable
specimen
that
all
said
the
professor
there
are
exceptions
to
every
rule
this
animal
horace
said
was
certainly
exceptional
enough
in
every
way
do
tell
us
all
about
it
pleaded
one
of
the
miss
wackerbaths
and
all
the
ladies
joined
in
the
entreaty
until
horace
found
himself
under
the
necessity
of
improvising
a
story
which
it
must
be
confessed
fell
exceedingly
flat
this
final
ordeal
past
he
grew
silent
and
thoughtful
as
he
sat
there
by
sylvia
side
looking
out
through
the
glazed
gallery
outside
upon
the
spring
foliage
along
the
embankment
the
opaline
river
and
the
shot
towers
and
buildings
on
the
opposite
bank
glowing
warm
brown
against
an
evening
sky
of
silvery
blue
not
for
the
first
time
did
it
seem
strange
incredible
almost
to
him
that
all
these
people
should
be
so
utterly
without
any
recollection
of
events
which
surely
might
have
been
expected
to
leave
some
trace
upon
the
least
retentive
memory
and
yet
it
only
proved
once
more
how
thoroughly
and
honourably
the
old
jinnee
now
slumbering
placidly
in
his
bottle
deep
down
in
unfathomable
mud
opposite
the
very
spot
where
they
were
dining
had
fulfilled
his
last
undertaking
fakrash
the
brass
bottle
and
all
the
fantastic
and
embarrassing
performances
were
indeed
as
totally
forgotten
as
though
they
had
never
been
and
it
is
but
too
probable
that
even
this
modest
and
veracious
account
of
them
will
prove
to
have
been
included
in
the
general
act
of
oblivion
though
the
author
will
trust
as
long
as
possible
that
may
have
neglected
to
provide
for
this
particular
case
and
that
the
history
of
the
brass
bottle
may
thus
be
permitted
to
linger
awhile
in
the
memories
of
some
at
least
of
its
readers
