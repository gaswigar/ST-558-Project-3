the

death
duel
life
of
john
from
the
life
by
izaak
master
john
donne
was
born
in
london
in
the
year
of
good
and
virtuous
parents
and
though
his
own
learning
and
other
multiplied
merits
may
justly
appear
sufficient
to
dignify
both
himself
and
his
posterity
yet
the
reader
may
be
pleased
to
know
that
his
father
was
masculinely
and
lineally
descended
from
a
very
ancient
family
in
wales
where
many
of
his
name
now
live
that
deserve
and
have
great
reputation
in
that
country
by
his
mother
he
was
descended
of
the
family
of
the
famous
and
learned
sir
thomas
more
sometime
lord
chancellor
of
england
as
also
from
that
worthy
and
laborious
judge
rastall
who
left
posterity
the
vast
statutes
of
the
law
of
this
nation
most
exactly
abridged
he
had
his
first
breeding
in
his
father
house
where
a
private
tutor
had
the
care
of
him
until
the
tenth
year
of
his
age
and
in
his
eleventh
year
was
sent
to
the
university
of
oxford
having
at
that
time
a
good
command
both
of
the
french
and
latin
tongue
this
and
some
other
of
his
remarkable
abilities
made
one
then
give
this
censure
of
him
that
this
age
had
brought
forth
another
picus
mirandula
of
whom
story
says
that
he
was
rather
born
than
made
wise
by
study
there
he
remained
for
some
years
in
hart
hall
having
for
the
advancement
of
his
studies
tutors
of
several
sciences
to
attend
and
instruct
him
till
time
made
him
capable
and
his
learning
expressed
in
public
exercises
declared
him
worthy
to
receive
his
first
degree
in
the
schools
which
he
forbore
by
advice
from
his
friends
who
being
for
their
religion
of
the
romish
persuasion
were
conscionably
averse
to
some
parts
of
the
oath
that
is
always
tendered
at
those
times
and
not
to
be
refused
by
those
that
expect
the
titulary
honour
of
their
studies
about
the
fourteenth
year
of
his
age
he
was
transplanted
from
oxford
to
cambridge
where
that
he
might
receive
nourishment
from
both
soils
he
staid
till
his
seventeenth
year
all
which
time
he
was
a
most
laborious
student
often
changing
his
studies
but
endeavouring
to
take
no
degree
for
the
reasons
formerly
mentioned
about
the
seventeenth
year
of
his
age
he
was
removed
to
london
and
then
admitted
into
lincoln
inn
with
an
intent
to
study
the
law
where
he
gave
great
testimonies
of
his
wit
his
learning
and
of
his
improvement
in
that
profession
which
never
served
him
for
other
use
than
an
ornament
and
his
father
died
before
his
admission
into
this
society
and
being
a
merchant
left
him
his
portion
in
money
it
was
his
mother
and
those
to
whose
care
he
was
committed
were
watchful
to
improve
his
knowledge
and
to
that
end
appointed
him
tutors
both
in
the
mathematics
and
in
all
the
other
liberal
sciences
to
attend
him
but
with
these
arts
they
were
advised
to
instil
into
him
particular
principles
of
the
romish
church
of
which
those
tutors
professed
though
secretly
themselves
to
be
members
they
had
almost
obliged
him
to
their
faith
having
for
their
advantage
besides
many
opportunities
the
example
of
his
dear
and
pious
parents
which
was
a
most
powerful
persuasion
and
did
work
much
upon
him
as
he
professeth
in
his
preface
to
his
a
book
of
which
the
reader
shall
have
some
account
in
what
follows
he
was
now
entered
into
the
eighteenth
year
of
his
age
and
at
that
time
had
betrothed
himself
to
no
religion
that
might
give
him
any
other
denomination
than
a
christian
and
reason
and
piety
had
both
persuaded
him
that
there
could
be
no
such
sin
as
schism
if
an
adherence
to
some
visible
church
were
not
necessary
about
the
nineteenth
year
of
his
age
he
being
then
unresolved
what
religion
to
adhere
to
and
considering
how
much
it
concerned
his
soul
to
choose
the
most
orthodox
did
therefore
though
his
youth
and
health
promised
him
a
long
life
to
rectify
all
scruples
that
might
concern
that
presently
lay
aside
all
study
of
the
law
and
of
all
other
sciences
that
might
give
him
a
denomination
and
began
seriously
to
survey
and
consider
the
body
of
divinity
as
it
was
then
controverted
betwixt
the
reformed
and
the
roman
church
and
as
god
blessed
spirit
did
then
awaken
him
to
the
search
and
in
that
industry
did
never
forsake
him
they
be
his
own
words
in
his
preface
to
so
he
calls
the
same
holy
spirit
to
witness
this
protestation
that
in
that
disquisition
and
search
he
proceeded
with
humility
and
diffidence
in
himself
and
by
that
which
he
took
to
be
the
safest
way
namely
frequent
prayers
and
an
indifferent
affection
to
both
parties
and
indeed
truth
had
too
much
light
about
her
to
be
hid
from
so
sharp
an
inquirer
and
he
had
too
much
ingenuity
not
to
acknowledge
he
had
found
her
being
to
undertake
this
search
he
believed
the
cardinal
bellarmine
to
be
the
best
defender
of
the
roman
cause
and
therefore
betook
himself
to
the
examination
of
his
reasons
the
cause
was
weighty
and
wilful
delays
had
been
inexcusable
both
towards
god
and
his
own
conscience
he
therefore
proceeded
in
this
search
with
all
moderate
haste
and
about
the
twentieth
year
of
his
age
did
show
the
then
dean
of
gloucester
whose
name
my
memory
hath
now
lost
all
the
cardinal
works
marked
with
many
weighty
observations
under
his
own
hand
which
works
were
bequeathed
by
him
at
his
death
as
a
legacy
to
a
most
dear
friend
about
a
year
following
he
resolved
to
travel
and
the
earl
of
essex
going
first
to
cales
and
after
the
island
voyages
the
first
anno
the
second
he
took
the
advantage
of
those
opportunities
waited
upon
his
lordship
and
was
an
of
those
happy
and
unhappy
employments
but
he
returned
not
back
into
england
till
he
had
staid
some
years
first
in
italy
and
then
in
spain
where
he
made
many
useful
observations
of
those
countries
their
laws
and
manner
of
government
and
returned
perfect
in
their
languages
the
time
that
he
spent
in
spain
was
at
his
first
going
into
italy
designed
for
travelling
to
the
holy
land
and
for
viewing
jerusalem
and
the
sepulchre
of
our
saviour
but
at
his
being
in
the
furthest
parts
of
italy
the
disappointment
of
company
or
of
a
safe
convoy
or
the
uncertainty
of
returns
of
money
into
those
remote
parts
denied
him
that
happiness
which
he
did
often
occasionally
mention
with
a
deploration
not
long
after
his
return
into
england
that
exemplary
pattern
of
gravity
and
wisdom
the
lord
ellesmere
then
keeper
of
the
great
seal
the
lord
chancellor
of
england
taking
notice
of
his
learning
languages
and
other
abilities
and
much
affecting
his
person
and
behaviour
took
him
to
be
his
chief
secretary
supposing
and
intending
it
to
be
an
introduction
to
some
more
weighty
employment
in
the
state
for
which
his
lordship
did
often
protest
he
thought
him
very
fit
nor
did
his
lordship
in
this
time
of
master
donne
attendance
upon
him
account
him
to
be
so
much
his
servant
as
to
forget
he
was
his
friend
and
to
testify
it
did
always
use
him
with
much
courtesy
appointing
him
a
place
at
his
own
table
to
which
he
esteemed
his
company
and
discourse
to
be
a
great
ornament
he
continued
that
employment
for
the
space
of
five
years
being
daily
useful
and
not
mercenary
to
his
friend
during
which
time
he
i
dare
not
say
unhappily
fell
into
such
a
liking
as
with
her
approbation
increased
into
a
love
with
a
young
gentlewoman
that
lived
in
that
family
who
was
niece
to
the
lady
ellesmere
and
daughter
to
sir
george
more
then
chancellor
of
the
garter
and
lieutenant
of
the
tower
sir
george
had
some
intimation
of
it
and
knowing
prevention
to
be
a
great
part
of
wisdom
did
therefore
remove
her
with
much
haste
from
that
to
his
own
house
at
lothesley
in
the
county
of
surrey
but
too
late
by
reason
of
some
faithful
promises
which
were
so
interchangeably
passed
as
never
to
be
violated
by
either
party
these
promises
were
only
known
to
themselves
and
the
friends
of
both
parties
used
much
diligence
and
many
arguments
to
kill
or
cool
their
affections
to
each
other
but
in
vain
for
love
is
a
flattering
mischief
that
hath
denied
aged
and
wise
men
a
foresight
of
those
evils
that
too
often
prove
to
be
the
children
of
that
blind
father
a
passion
that
carries
us
to
commit
errors
with
as
much
ease
as
whirlwinds
move
feathers
and
begets
in
us
an
unwearied
industry
to
the
attainment
of
what
we
desire
and
such
an
industry
did
notwithstanding
much
watchfulness
against
it
bring
them
secretly
together
i
forbear
to
tell
the
manner
how
and
at
last
to
a
marriage
too
without
the
allowance
of
those
friends
whose
approbation
always
was
and
ever
will
be
necessary
to
make
even
a
virtuous
love
become
lawful
and
that
the
knowledge
of
their
marriage
might
not
fall
like
an
unexpected
tempest
on
those
that
were
unwilling
to
have
it
so
and
that
might
make
it
the
less
enormous
when
it
was
known
it
was
purposely
whispered
into
the
ears
of
many
that
it
was
so
yet
by
none
that
could
affirm
it
but
to
put
a
period
to
the
jealousies
of
sir
george
doubt
often
begetting
more
restless
thoughts
than
the
certain
knowledge
of
what
we
fear
the
news
was
in
favour
to
donne
and
with
his
allowance
made
known
to
sir
george
by
his
honourable
friend
and
neighbour
henry
earl
of
northumberland
but
it
was
to
sir
george
so
immeasurably
unwelcome
and
so
transported
him
that
as
though
his
passion
of
anger
and
inconsideration
might
exceed
theirs
of
love
and
error
he
presently
engaged
his
sister
the
lady
ellesmere
to
join
with
him
to
procure
her
lord
to
discharge
donne
of
the
place
he
held
under
his
lordship
this
request
was
followed
with
violence
and
though
sir
george
were
remembered
that
errors
might
be
over
punished
and
desired
therefore
to
forbear
till
second
considerations
might
clear
some
scruples
yet
he
became
restless
until
his
suit
was
granted
and
the
punishment
executed
and
though
the
lord
chancellor
did
not
at
donne
dismission
give
him
such
a
commendation
as
the
great
emperor
charles
the
fifth
did
of
his
secretary
eraso
when
he
parted
with
him
to
his
son
and
successor
philip
the
second
saying
that
in
his
eraso
he
gave
to
him
a
greater
gift
than
all
his
estate
and
all
the
kingdoms
which
he
then
resigned
to
him
yet
the
lord
chancellor
said
he
parted
with
a
friend
and
such
a
secretary
as
was
fitter
to
serve
a
king
than
a
subject
immediately
after
his
dismission
from
his
service
he
sent
a
sad
letter
to
his
wife
to
acquaint
her
with
it
and
after
the
subscription
of
his
name
writ
john
donne
anne
donne
and
god
knows
it
proved
too
true
for
this
bitter
physic
of
dismission
was
not
enough
to
purge
out
all
sir
george
choler
for
he
was
not
satisfied
till
donne
and
his
sometime
compupil
in
cambridge
that
married
him
namely
samuel
brooke
who
was
after
doctor
in
divinity
and
master
of
trinity
college
and
his
brother
christopher
brooke
sometime
donne
in
lincoln
inn
who
gave
donne
his
wife
and
witnessed
the
marriage
were
all
committed
to
three
several
prisons
donne
was
first
enlarged
who
neither
gave
rest
to
his
body
or
brain
nor
to
any
friend
in
whom
he
might
hope
to
have
an
interest
until
he
had
procured
an
enlargement
for
his
two
imprisoned
friends
he
was
now
at
liberty
but
his
days
were
still
cloudy
and
being
past
these
troubles
others
did
still
multiply
upon
him
for
his
wife
was
to
her
extreme
sorrow
detained
from
him
and
though
with
jacob
he
endured
not
a
hard
service
for
her
yet
he
lost
a
good
one
and
was
forced
to
make
good
his
title
and
to
get
possession
of
her
by
a
long
and
restless
suit
in
law
which
proved
troublesome
and
sadly
chargeable
to
him
whose
youth
and
travel
and
needless
bounty
had
brought
his
estate
into
a
narrow
compass
it
is
observed
and
most
truly
that
silence
and
submission
are
charming
qualities
and
work
most
upon
passionate
men
and
it
proved
so
with
sir
george
for
these
and
a
general
report
of
donne
merits
together
with
his
winning
behaviour
which
when
it
would
entice
had
a
strange
kind
of
elegant
irresistible
art
these
and
time
had
so
dispassionated
sir
george
that
as
the
world
had
approved
his
daughter
choice
so
he
also
could
not
but
see
a
more
than
ordinary
merit
in
his
new
son
and
this
at
last
melted
him
into
so
much
remorse
for
love
and
anger
are
so
like
agues
as
to
have
hot
and
cold
fits
and
love
in
parents
though
it
may
be
quenched
yet
is
easily
rekindled
and
expires
not
till
death
denies
mankind
a
natural
heat
that
he
laboured
his
son
restoration
to
his
place
using
to
that
end
both
his
own
and
his
sister
power
to
her
lord
but
with
no
success
for
his
answer
was
that
though
he
was
unfeignedly
sorry
for
what
he
had
done
yet
it
was
inconsistent
with
his
place
and
credit
to
discharge
and
readmit
servants
at
the
request
of
passionate
petitioners
sir
george
endeavour
for
donne
readmission
was
by
all
means
to
be
kept
secret
for
men
do
more
naturally
reluct
for
errors
than
submit
to
put
on
those
blemishes
that
attend
their
visible
acknowledgment
but
however
it
was
not
long
before
sir
george
appeared
to
be
so
far
reconciled
as
to
wish
their
happiness
and
not
to
deny
them
his
paternal
blessing
but
yet
refused
to
contribute
any
means
that
might
conduce
to
their
livelihood
donne
estate
was
the
greatest
part
spent
in
many
and
chargeable
travels
books
and
experience
he
out
of
all
employment
that
might
yield
a
support
for
himself
and
wife
who
had
been
curiously
and
plentifully
educated
both
their
natures
generous
and
accustomed
to
confer
and
not
to
receive
courtesies
these
and
other
considerations
but
chiefly
that
his
wife
was
to
bear
a
part
in
his
sufferings
surrounded
him
with
many
sad
thoughts
and
some
apparent
apprehensions
of
want
but
his
sorrows
were
lessened
and
his
wants
prevented
by
the
seasonable
courtesy
of
their
noble
kinsman
sir
francis
wolly
of
pirford
in
surrey
who
intreated
them
to
a
cohabitation
with
him
where
they
remained
with
much
freedom
to
themselves
and
equal
content
to
him
for
some
years
and
as
their
charge
increased
she
had
yearly
a
child
so
did
his
love
and
bounty
donne
and
his
wife
continued
with
sir
francis
wolly
till
his
death
a
little
before
which
time
sir
francis
was
so
happy
as
to
make
a
perfect
reconciliation
between
sir
george
and
his
forsaken
son
and
daughter
sir
george
conditioning
by
bond
to
pay
to
donne
at
a
certain
day
as
a
portion
with
his
wife
or
quarterly
for
their
maintenance
as
the
interest
for
it
till
the
said
portion
was
paid
most
of
those
years
that
he
lived
with
sir
francis
he
studied
the
civil
and
canon
laws
in
which
he
acquired
such
a
perfection
as
was
judged
to
hold
proportion
with
many
who
had
made
that
study
the
employment
of
their
whole
life
sir
francis
being
dead
and
that
happy
family
dissolved
donne
took
for
himself
a
house
in
mitcham
near
to
croydon
in
surrey
a
place
noted
for
good
air
and
choice
company
there
his
wife
and
children
remained
and
for
himself
he
took
lodgings
in
london
near
to
whitehall
whither
his
friends
and
occasions
drew
him
very
often
and
where
he
was
as
often
visited
by
many
of
the
nobility
and
others
of
this
nation
who
used
him
in
their
counsels
of
greatest
consideration
and
with
some
rewards
for
his
better
subsistence
nor
did
our
own
nobility
only
value
and
favour
him
but
his
acquaintance
and
friendship
was
sought
for
by
most
ambassadors
of
foreign
nations
and
by
many
other
strangers
whose
learning
or
business
occasioned
their
stay
in
this
nation
thus
it
continued
with
him
for
about
two
years
all
which
time
his
family
remained
constantly
at
mitcham
and
to
which
place
he
often
retired
himself
and
destined
some
days
to
a
constant
study
of
some
points
of
controversy
betwixt
the
english
and
roman
church
and
especially
those
of
supremacy
and
allegiance
and
to
that
place
and
such
studies
he
could
willingly
have
wedded
himself
during
his
life
but
the
earnest
persuasion
of
friends
became
at
last
to
be
so
powerful
as
to
cause
the
removal
of
himself
and
family
to
london
where
sir
robert
drewry
a
gentleman
of
a
very
noble
estate
and
a
more
liberal
mind
assigned
him
and
his
wife
an
useful
apartment
in
his
own
large
house
in
drury
lane
and
not
only
rent
free
but
was
also
a
cherisher
of
his
studies
and
such
a
friend
as
sympathized
with
him
and
his
in
all
their
joy
and
sorrows
at
this
time
of
donne
and
his
wife
living
in
sir
robert
house
the
lord
hay
was
by
king
james
sent
upon
a
glorious
embassy
to
the
then
french
king
henry
the
fourth
and
sir
robert
put
on
a
sudden
resolution
to
accompany
him
to
the
french
court
and
to
be
present
at
his
audience
there
and
sir
robert
put
on
a
sudden
resolution
to
solicit
donne
to
be
his
companion
in
that
journey
and
this
desire
was
suddenly
made
known
to
his
wife
who
was
then
with
child
and
otherwise
under
so
dangerous
a
habit
of
body
as
to
her
health
that
she
professed
an
unwillingness
to
allow
him
any
absence
from
her
saying
her
divining
soul
boded
her
some
ill
in
his
absence
and
therefore
desired
him
not
to
leave
her
this
made
donne
lay
aside
all
thoughts
of
the
journey
and
really
to
resolve
against
it
but
sir
robert
became
restless
in
his
persuasions
for
it
and
donne
was
so
generous
as
to
think
he
had
sold
his
liberty
when
he
received
so
many
charitable
kindnesses
from
him
and
told
his
wife
so
who
did
therefore
with
an
unwilling
willingness
give
a
faint
consent
to
the
journey
which
was
proposed
to
be
but
for
two
months
for
about
that
time
they
determined
their
return
within
a
few
days
after
this
resolve
the
ambassador
sir
robert
and
donne
left
london
and
were
the
twelfth
day
got
all
safe
to
paris
two
days
after
their
arrival
there
donne
was
left
alone
in
that
room
in
which
sir
robert
and
he
and
some
other
friends
had
dined
together
to
this
place
sir
robert
returned
within
half
an
hour
and
as
he
left
so
he
found
donne
alone
but
in
such
an
ecstasy
and
so
altered
as
to
his
looks
as
amazed
sir
robert
to
behold
him
insomuch
that
he
earnestly
desired
donne
to
declare
what
had
befallen
him
in
the
short
time
of
his
absence
to
which
donne
was
not
able
to
make
a
present
answer
but
after
a
long
and
perplexed
pause
did
at
last
say
i
have
seen
a
dreadful
vision
since
i
saw
you
i
have
seen
my
dear
wife
pass
twice
by
me
through
this
room
with
her
hair
hanging
about
her
shoulders
and
a
dead
child
in
her
arms
this
i
have
seen
since
i
saw
you
to
which
sir
robert
replied
sure
sir
you
have
slept
since
i
saw
you
and
this
is
the
result
of
some
melancholy
dream
which
i
desire
you
to
forget
for
you
are
now
awake
to
which
donne
reply
was
i
can
not
be
surer
that
i
now
live
than
that
i
have
not
slept
since
i
saw
you
and
am
as
sure
that
at
her
second
appearing
she
stopped
and
looked
me
in
the
face
and
vanished
rest
and
sleep
had
not
altered
donne
opinion
the
next
day
for
he
then
affirmed
this
vision
with
a
more
deliberate
and
so
confirmed
a
confidence
that
he
inclined
sir
robert
to
a
faint
belief
that
the
vision
was
true
it
is
truly
said
that
desire
and
doubt
have
no
rest
and
it
proved
so
with
sir
robert
for
he
immediately
sent
a
servant
to
drewry
house
with
a
charge
to
hasten
back
and
bring
him
word
whether
donne
were
alive
and
if
alive
in
what
condition
she
was
as
to
her
health
the
twelfth
day
the
messenger
returned
with
this
account
that
he
found
and
left
donne
very
sad
and
sick
in
her
bed
and
that
after
a
long
and
dangerous
labour
she
had
been
delivered
of
a
dead
child
and
upon
examination
the
abortion
proved
to
be
the
same
day
and
about
the
very
hour
that
donne
affirmed
he
saw
her
pass
by
him
in
his
chamber
this
is
a
relation
that
will
beget
some
wonder
and
it
well
may
for
most
of
our
world
are
at
present
possessed
with
an
opinion
that
visions
and
miracles
are
ceased
and
though
it
is
most
certain
that
two
lutes
being
both
strung
and
tuned
to
an
equal
pitch
and
then
one
played
upon
the
other
that
is
not
touched
being
laid
upon
a
table
at
a
fit
distance
will
like
an
echo
to
a
trumpet
warble
a
faint
audible
harmony
in
answer
to
the
same
tune
yet
many
will
not
believe
there
is
any
such
thing
as
a
sympathy
of
souls
and
i
am
well
pleased
that
every
reader
do
enjoy
his
own
opinion
but
if
the
unbelieving
will
not
allow
the
believing
reader
of
this
story
a
liberty
to
believe
that
it
may
be
true
then
i
wish
him
to
consider
many
wise
men
have
believed
that
the
ghost
of
julius
cæsar
did
appear
to
brutus
and
that
both
austin
and
monica
his
mother
had
visions
in
order
to
his
conversion
and
though
these
and
many
others
too
many
to
name
have
but
the
authority
of
human
story
yet
the
incredible
reader
may
find
in
the
sacred
story
sam
xxviii
that
samuel
did
appear
to
saul
even
after
his
death
whether
really
or
not
i
undertake
not
to
determine
and
bildad
in
the
book
of
job
says
these
words
iv
a
spirit
passed
before
my
face
the
hair
of
my
head
stood
up
fear
and
trembling
came
upon
me
and
made
all
my
bones
to
shake
upon
which
words
i
will
make
no
comment
but
leave
them
to
be
considered
by
the
incredulous
reader
to
whom
i
will
also
commend
this
following
consideration
that
there
be
many
pious
and
learned
men
that
believe
our
merciful
god
hath
assigned
to
every
man
a
particular
guardian
angel
to
be
his
constant
monitor
and
to
attend
him
in
all
his
dangers
both
of
body
and
soul
and
the
opinion
that
every
man
hath
his
particular
angel
may
gain
some
authority
by
the
relation
of
peter
miraculous
deliverance
out
of
prison
acts
xii
not
by
many
but
by
one
angel
and
this
belief
may
yet
gain
more
credit
by
the
reader
considering
that
when
peter
after
his
enlargement
knocked
at
the
door
of
mary
the
mother
of
john
and
rhode
the
maidservant
being
surprised
with
joy
that
peter
was
there
did
not
let
him
in
but
ran
in
haste
and
told
the
disciples
who
were
then
and
there
met
together
that
peter
was
at
the
door
and
they
not
believing
it
said
she
was
mad
yet
when
she
again
affirmed
it
though
they
then
believed
it
not
yet
they
concluded
and
said
it
is
his
angel
more
observations
of
this
nature
and
inferences
from
them
might
be
made
to
gain
the
relation
a
firmer
belief
but
i
forbear
lest
i
that
intended
to
be
but
a
relator
may
be
thought
to
be
an
engaged
person
for
the
proving
what
was
related
to
me
and
yet
i
think
myself
bound
to
declare
that
though
it
was
not
told
me
by
donne
himself
it
was
told
me
now
long
since
by
a
person
of
honour
and
of
such
intimacy
with
him
that
he
knew
more
of
the
secrets
of
his
soul
than
any
person
then
living
and
i
think
he
told
me
the
truth
for
it
was
told
with
such
circumstances
and
such
asseveration
that
to
say
nothing
of
my
own
thoughts
i
verily
believe
he
that
told
it
me
did
himself
believe
it
to
be
true
i
return
from
my
account
of
the
vision
to
tell
the
reader
that
both
before
donne
going
into
france
at
his
being
there
and
after
his
return
many
of
the
nobility
and
others
that
were
powerful
at
court
were
watchful
and
solicitous
to
the
king
for
some
secular
employment
for
him
the
king
had
formerly
both
known
and
put
a
value
upon
his
company
and
had
also
given
him
some
hopes
of
a
being
always
much
pleased
when
donne
attended
him
especially
at
his
meals
where
there
were
usually
many
deep
discourses
of
general
learning
and
very
often
friendly
disputes
or
debates
of
religion
betwixt
his
majesty
and
those
divines
whose
places
required
their
attendance
on
him
at
those
times
particularly
the
dean
of
the
chapel
who
then
was
bishop
montague
the
publisher
of
the
learned
and
eloquent
works
of
his
majesty
and
the
most
reverend
doctor
andrews
the
late
learned
bishop
of
winchester
who
was
then
the
king
almoner
about
this
time
there
grew
many
disputes
that
concerned
the
oath
of
supremacy
and
allegiance
in
which
the
king
had
appeared
and
engaged
himself
by
his
public
writings
now
extant
and
his
majesty
discoursing
with
donne
concerning
many
of
the
reasons
which
are
usually
urged
against
the
taking
of
those
oaths
apprehended
such
a
validity
and
clearness
in
his
stating
the
questions
and
his
answers
to
them
that
his
majesty
commanded
him
to
bestow
some
time
in
drawing
the
arguments
into
a
method
and
then
to
write
his
answers
to
them
and
having
done
that
not
to
send
but
be
his
own
messenger
and
bring
them
to
him
to
this
he
presently
and
diligently
applied
himself
and
within
six
weeks
brought
them
to
him
under
his
own
handwriting
as
they
be
now
printed
the
book
bearing
the
name
of
printed
anno
when
the
king
had
read
and
considered
that
book
he
persuaded
donne
to
enter
into
the
ministry
to
which
at
that
time
he
was
and
appeared
very
unwilling
apprehending
it
such
was
his
mistaken
modesty
to
be
too
weighty
for
his
abilities
such
strifes
austin
had
when
ambrose
endeavoured
his
conversion
to
christianity
with
which
he
confesseth
he
acquainted
his
friend
alipius
our
learned
author
a
man
fit
to
write
after
no
mean
copy
did
the
like
and
declaring
his
intentions
to
his
dear
friend
king
then
bishop
of
london
a
man
famous
in
his
generation
and
no
stranger
to
donne
abilities
for
he
had
been
chaplain
to
the
lord
chancellor
at
the
time
of
donne
being
his
lordship
secretary
that
reverend
man
did
receive
the
news
with
much
gladness
and
after
some
expressions
of
joy
and
a
persuasion
to
be
constant
in
his
pious
purpose
he
proceeded
with
all
convenient
speed
to
ordain
him
first
deacon
and
then
priest
not
long
after
presently
after
he
entered
into
his
holy
profession
the
king
sent
for
him
and
made
him
his
chaplain
in
ordinary
and
promised
to
take
a
particular
care
for
his
preferment
and
though
his
long
familiarity
with
scholars
and
persons
of
greatest
quality
was
such
as
might
have
given
some
men
boldness
enough
to
have
preached
to
any
eminent
auditory
yet
his
modesty
in
this
employment
was
such
that
he
could
not
be
persuaded
to
it
but
went
usually
accompanied
with
some
one
friend
to
preach
privately
in
some
village
not
far
from
london
his
first
sermon
being
preached
at
paddington
this
he
did
till
his
majesty
sent
and
appointed
him
a
day
to
preach
to
him
at
whitehall
and
though
much
were
expected
from
him
both
by
his
majesty
and
others
yet
he
was
so
happy
which
few
are
as
to
satisfy
and
exceed
their
expectations
preaching
the
word
so
as
shewed
his
own
heart
was
possessed
with
those
very
thoughts
and
joys
that
he
laboured
to
distil
into
others
a
preacher
in
earnest
weeping
sometimes
for
his
auditory
sometimes
with
them
always
preaching
to
himself
like
an
angel
from
a
cloud
but
in
none
carrying
some
as
paul
was
to
heaven
in
holy
raptures
and
enticing
others
by
a
sacred
art
and
courtship
to
amend
their
lives
here
picturing
a
vice
so
as
to
make
it
ugly
to
those
that
practised
it
and
a
virtue
so
as
to
make
it
beloved
even
by
those
that
loved
it
not
and
all
this
with
a
most
particular
grace
and
an
unexpressible
addition
of
comeliness
that
summer
in
the
very
same
month
in
which
he
entered
into
sacred
orders
and
was
made
the
king
chaplain
his
majesty
then
going
his
progress
was
entreated
to
receive
an
entertainment
in
the
university
of
cambridge
and
donne
attending
his
majesty
at
that
time
his
majesty
was
pleased
to
recommend
him
to
the
university
to
be
made
doctor
in
divinity
doctor
harsnett
after
archbishop
of
york
was
then
who
knowing
him
to
be
the
author
of
that
learned
book
the
required
no
other
proof
of
his
abilities
but
proposed
it
to
the
university
who
presently
assented
and
expressed
a
gladness
that
they
had
such
an
occasion
to
entitle
him
to
be
theirs
his
abilities
and
industry
in
his
profession
were
so
eminent
and
he
so
known
and
so
beloved
by
persons
of
quality
that
within
the
first
year
of
his
entering
into
sacred
orders
he
had
fourteen
advowsons
of
several
benefices
presented
to
him
but
they
were
in
the
country
and
he
could
not
leave
his
beloved
london
to
which
place
he
had
a
natural
inclination
having
received
both
his
birth
and
education
in
it
and
there
contracted
a
friendship
with
many
whose
conversation
multiplied
the
joys
of
his
life
but
an
employment
that
might
affix
him
to
that
place
would
be
welcome
for
he
needed
it
immediately
after
his
return
from
cambridge
his
wife
died
leaving
him
a
man
of
a
narrow
unsettled
estate
and
having
buried
five
the
careful
father
of
seven
children
then
living
to
whom
he
gave
a
voluntary
assurance
never
to
bring
them
under
the
subjection
of
a
which
promise
he
kept
most
faithfully
burying
with
his
tears
all
his
earthly
joys
in
his
most
dear
and
deserving
wife
grave
and
betook
himself
to
a
most
retired
and
solitary
life
in
this
retiredness
which
was
often
from
the
sight
of
his
dearest
friends
he
became
crucified
to
the
world
and
all
those
vanities
those
imaginary
pleasures
that
are
daily
acted
on
that
restless
stage
and
they
were
as
perfectly
crucified
to
him
his
first
motion
from
his
house
was
to
preach
where
his
beloved
wife
lay
buried
in
clement
church
near
temple
bar
london
and
his
text
was
a
part
of
the
prophet
jeremy
lamentation
lo
i
am
the
man
that
have
seen
affliction
in
this
time
of
sadness
he
was
importuned
by
the
grave
benchers
of
lincoln
inn
who
were
once
the
companions
and
friends
of
his
youth
to
accept
of
their
lecture
which
by
reason
of
gataker
removal
from
thence
was
then
void
of
which
he
accepted
being
most
glad
to
renew
his
intermitted
friendship
with
those
whom
he
so
much
loved
and
where
he
had
been
a
saul
though
not
to
persecute
christianity
or
to
deride
it
yet
in
his
irregular
youth
to
neglect
the
visible
practice
of
it
there
to
become
a
paul
and
preach
salvation
to
his
beloved
brethren
about
which
time
the
emperor
of
germany
died
and
the
palsgrave
who
had
lately
married
the
lady
elizabeth
the
king
only
daughter
was
elected
and
crowned
king
of
bohemia
the
unhappy
beginning
of
many
miseries
in
that
nation
king
james
whose
motto
did
truly
speak
the
very
thoughts
of
his
heart
endeavoured
first
to
prevent
and
after
to
compose
the
discords
of
that
discomposed
state
and
amongst
other
his
endeavours
did
then
send
the
lord
hay
earl
of
doncaster
his
ambassador
to
those
unsettled
princes
and
by
a
special
command
from
his
majesty
donne
was
appointed
to
assist
and
attend
that
employment
to
the
princes
of
the
union
for
which
the
earl
was
most
glad
who
had
always
put
a
great
value
on
him
and
taken
a
great
pleasure
in
his
conversation
and
discourse
and
his
friends
at
inn
were
as
glad
for
they
feared
that
his
immoderate
study
and
sadness
for
his
wife
death
would
as
jacob
said
make
his
days
few
and
respecting
his
bodily
health
evil
too
and
of
this
there
were
many
visible
signs
about
fourteen
months
after
his
departure
out
of
england
he
returned
to
his
friends
of
lincoln
inn
with
his
sorrows
moderated
and
his
health
improved
and
there
betook
himself
to
his
constant
course
of
preaching
about
a
year
after
his
return
out
of
germany
carey
was
made
bishop
of
exeter
and
by
his
removal
the
deanery
of
paul
being
vacant
the
king
sent
to
donne
and
appointed
him
to
attend
him
at
dinner
the
next
day
when
his
majesty
was
sat
down
before
he
had
eat
any
meat
he
said
after
his
pleasant
manner
donne
i
have
invited
you
to
dinner
and
though
you
sit
not
down
with
me
yet
i
will
carve
to
you
of
a
dish
that
i
know
you
love
well
for
knowing
you
love
london
i
do
therefore
make
you
dean
of
paul
and
when
i
have
dined
then
do
you
take
your
beloved
dish
home
to
your
study
say
grace
there
to
yourself
and
much
good
may
it
do
you
immediately
after
he
came
to
his
deanery
he
employed
workmen
to
repair
and
beautify
the
chapel
suffering
as
holy
david
once
vowed
his
eyes
and
temples
to
take
no
rest
till
he
had
first
beautified
the
house
of
god
the
next
quarter
following
when
his
sir
george
more
whom
time
had
made
a
lover
and
admirer
of
him
came
to
pay
to
him
the
conditioned
sum
of
twenty
pounds
he
refused
to
receive
it
and
said
as
good
jacob
did
when
he
heard
his
beloved
son
joseph
was
alive
is
enough
you
have
been
kind
to
me
and
mine
i
know
your
present
condition
is
such
as
not
to
abound
and
i
hope
mine
is
or
will
be
such
as
not
to
need
it
i
will
therefore
receive
no
more
from
you
upon
that
contract
and
in
testimony
of
it
freely
gave
him
up
his
bond
immediately
after
his
admission
into
his
deanery
the
vicarage
of
dunstan
in
the
west
london
fell
to
him
by
the
death
of
white
the
advowson
of
it
having
been
given
to
him
long
before
by
his
honourable
friend
richard
earl
of
dorset
then
the
patron
and
confirmed
by
his
brother
the
late
deceased
edward
both
of
them
men
of
much
honour
by
these
and
another
ecclesiastical
endowment
which
fell
to
him
about
the
same
time
given
to
him
formerly
by
the
earl
of
kent
he
was
enabled
to
become
charitable
to
the
poor
and
kind
to
his
friends
and
to
make
such
provision
for
his
children
that
they
were
not
left
scandalous
as
relating
to
their
or
his
profession
and
quality
the
next
parliament
which
was
within
that
present
year
he
was
chosen
prolocutor
to
the
convocation
and
about
that
time
was
appointed
by
his
majesty
his
most
gracious
master
to
preach
very
many
occasional
sermons
as
at
paul
cross
and
other
places
all
which
employments
he
performed
to
the
admiration
of
the
representative
body
of
the
whole
clergy
of
this
nation
he
was
once
and
but
once
clouded
with
the
king
displeasure
and
it
was
about
this
time
which
was
occasioned
by
some
malicious
whisperer
who
had
told
his
majesty
that
donne
had
put
on
the
general
humour
of
the
pulpits
and
was
become
busy
in
insinuating
a
fear
of
the
inclining
to
popery
and
a
dislike
of
his
government
and
particularly
for
the
king
then
turning
the
evening
lectures
into
catechising
and
expounding
the
prayer
of
our
lord
and
of
the
belief
and
commandments
his
majesty
was
the
more
inclinable
to
believe
this
for
that
a
person
of
nobility
and
great
note
betwixt
whom
and
donne
there
had
been
a
great
friendship
was
at
this
very
time
discarded
the
court
i
shall
forbear
his
name
unless
i
had
a
fairer
occasion
and
justly
committed
to
prison
which
begot
many
rumours
in
the
common
people
who
in
this
nation
think
they
are
not
wise
unless
they
be
busy
about
what
they
understand
not
and
especially
about
religion
the
king
received
this
news
with
so
much
discontent
and
restlessness
that
he
would
not
suffer
the
sun
to
set
and
leave
him
under
this
doubt
but
sent
for
donne
and
required
his
answer
to
the
accusation
which
was
so
clear
and
satisfactory
that
the
king
said
he
was
right
glad
he
rested
no
longer
under
the
suspicion
when
the
king
had
said
this
donne
kneeled
down
and
thanked
his
majesty
and
protested
his
answer
was
faithful
and
free
from
all
collusion
and
therefore
desired
that
he
might
not
rise
till
as
in
like
cases
he
always
had
from
god
so
he
might
have
from
his
majesty
some
assurance
that
he
stood
clear
and
fair
in
his
opinion
at
which
the
king
raised
him
from
his
knees
with
his
own
hands
and
protested
he
believed
him
and
that
he
knew
he
was
an
honest
man
and
doubted
not
but
that
he
loved
him
truly
and
having
thus
dismissed
him
he
called
some
lords
of
his
council
into
his
chamber
and
said
with
much
earnestness
my
doctor
is
an
honest
man
and
my
lords
i
was
never
better
satisfied
with
an
answer
than
he
hath
now
made
me
and
i
always
rejoice
when
i
think
that
by
my
means
he
became
a
divine
he
was
made
dean
in
the
fiftieth
year
of
his
age
and
in
his
year
a
dangerous
sickness
seized
him
which
inclined
him
to
a
consumption
but
god
as
job
thankfully
acknowledged
preserved
his
spirit
and
kept
his
intellectuals
as
clear
and
perfect
as
when
that
sickness
first
seized
his
body
but
it
continued
long
and
threatened
him
with
death
which
he
dreaded
not
within
a
few
days
his
distempers
abated
and
as
his
strength
increased
so
did
his
thankfulness
to
almighty
god
testified
in
his
most
excellent
book
of
devotions
which
he
published
at
his
recovery
in
which
the
reader
may
see
the
most
secret
thoughts
that
then
possessed
his
soul
paraphrased
and
made
public
a
book
that
may
not
unfitly
be
called
a
sacred
picture
of
spiritual
ecstasies
occasioned
and
applicable
to
the
emergencies
of
that
sickness
which
book
being
a
composition
of
meditations
disquisitions
and
prayers
he
writ
on
his
herein
imitating
the
holy
patriarchs
who
were
wont
to
build
their
altars
in
that
place
where
they
had
received
their
blessings
this
sickness
brought
him
so
near
to
the
gates
of
death
and
he
saw
the
grave
so
ready
to
devour
him
that
he
would
often
say
his
recovery
was
supernatural
but
that
god
that
then
restored
his
health
continued
it
to
him
till
the
year
of
his
life
and
then
in
august
being
with
his
eldest
daughter
harvey
at
abury
hatch
in
essex
he
there
fell
into
a
fever
which
with
the
help
of
his
constant
infirmity
vapours
from
the
spleen
hastened
him
into
so
visible
a
consumption
that
his
beholders
might
say
as
paul
of
himself
he
dies
daily
and
he
might
say
with
job
my
welfare
passeth
away
as
a
cloud
the
days
of
my
affliction
have
taken
hold
of
me
and
weary
nights
are
appointed
for
me
reader
this
sickness
continued
long
not
only
weakening
but
wearying
him
so
much
that
my
desire
is
he
may
now
take
some
rest
and
that
before
i
speak
of
his
death
thou
wilt
not
think
it
an
impertinent
digression
to
look
back
with
me
upon
some
observations
of
his
life
which
whilst
a
gentle
slumber
gives
rest
to
his
spirits
may
i
hope
not
unfitly
exercise
thy
consideration
his
marriage
was
the
remarkable
error
of
his
life
an
error
which
though
he
had
a
wit
able
and
very
apt
to
maintain
paradoxes
yet
he
was
very
far
from
justifying
it
and
though
his
wife
competent
years
and
other
reasons
might
be
justly
urged
to
moderate
severe
censures
yet
he
would
occasionally
condemn
himself
for
it
and
doubtless
it
had
been
attended
with
an
heavy
repentance
if
god
had
not
blessed
them
with
so
mutual
and
cordial
affections
as
in
the
midst
of
their
sufferings
made
their
bread
of
sorrow
taste
more
pleasantly
than
the
banquets
of
dull
and
people
the
recreations
of
his
youth
were
poetry
in
which
he
was
so
happy
as
if
nature
and
all
her
varieties
had
been
made
only
to
exercise
his
sharp
wit
and
high
fancy
and
in
those
pieces
which
were
facetiously
composed
and
carelessly
scattered
most
of
them
being
written
before
the
twentieth
year
of
his
age
it
may
appear
by
his
choice
metaphors
that
both
nature
and
all
the
arts
joined
to
assist
him
with
their
utmost
skill
it
is
a
truth
that
in
his
penitential
years
viewing
some
of
those
pieces
that
had
been
loosely
god
knows
too
loosely
scattered
in
his
youth
he
wished
they
had
been
abortive
or
so
that
his
own
eyes
had
witnessed
their
funerals
but
though
he
was
no
friend
to
them
he
was
not
so
fallen
out
with
heavenly
poetry
as
to
forsake
that
no
not
in
his
declining
age
witnessed
then
by
many
divine
sonnets
and
other
high
holy
and
harmonious
composures
yea
even
on
his
former
he
wrote
this
heavenly
hymn
expressing
the
great
joy
that
then
possessed
his
soul
in
the
assurance
of
god
favour
to
him
when
he
composed
it
an
hymn
to
god
the
father
wilt
thou
forgive
that
sin
where
i
begun
which
was
my
sin
though
it
were
done
before
wilt
thou
forgive
that
sin
through
which
i
run
and
do
run
still
though
still
i
do
deplore
when
thou
hast
done
thou
hast
not
done
for
i
have
more
wilt
thou
forgive
that
sin
which
i
have
won
others
to
sin
and
made
my
sin
their
door
wilt
thou
forgive
that
sin
which
i
did
shun
a
year
or
two
but
wallow
in
a
score
when
thou
hast
done
thou
hast
not
done
for
i
have
more
i
have
a
sin
of
fear
that
when
i
spun
my
last
thread
i
shall
perish
on
the
shore
but
swear
by
thyself
that
at
my
death
thy
son
shall
shine
as
he
shines
now
and
heretofore
and
having
done
that
thou
hast
done
i
fear
no
more
i
have
the
rather
mentioned
this
hymn
for
that
he
caused
it
to
be
set
to
a
most
grave
and
solemn
tune
and
to
be
often
sung
to
the
organ
by
the
choiristers
of
paul
church
in
his
own
hearing
especially
at
the
evening
service
and
at
his
return
from
his
customary
devotions
in
that
place
did
occasionally
say
to
a
friend
the
words
of
this
hymn
have
restored
to
me
the
same
thoughts
of
joy
that
possessed
my
soul
in
my
sickness
when
i
composed
it
and
o
the
power
of
that
harmony
added
to
this
hymn
has
raised
the
affections
of
my
heart
and
quickened
my
graces
of
zeal
and
gratitude
and
i
observe
that
i
always
return
from
paying
this
public
duty
of
prayer
and
praise
to
god
with
an
unexpressible
tranquillity
of
mind
and
a
willingness
to
leave
the
world
after
this
manner
did
the
disciples
of
our
saviour
and
the
best
of
christians
in
those
ages
of
the
church
nearest
to
his
time
offer
their
praises
to
almighty
god
and
the
reader
of
augustine
life
may
there
find
that
towards
his
dissolution
he
wept
abundantly
that
the
enemies
of
christianity
had
broke
in
upon
them
and
profaned
and
ruined
their
sanctuaries
and
because
their
public
hymns
and
lauds
were
lost
out
of
their
churches
and
after
this
manner
have
many
devout
souls
lifted
up
their
hands
and
offered
acceptable
sacrifices
unto
almighty
god
where
donne
offered
his
and
now
lies
buried
but
now
oh
lord
how
is
that
place
become
desolate
before
i
proceed
further
i
think
fit
to
inform
the
reader
that
not
long
before
his
death
he
caused
to
be
drawn
a
figure
of
the
body
of
christ
extended
upon
an
anchor
like
those
which
painters
draw
when
they
would
present
us
with
the
picture
of
christ
crucified
on
the
cross
his
varying
no
otherwise
than
to
affix
him
not
to
a
cross
but
to
an
anchor
the
emblem
of
hope
this
he
caused
to
be
drawn
in
little
and
then
many
of
those
figures
thus
drawn
to
be
engraven
very
small
in
heliotropium
stones
and
set
in
gold
and
of
these
he
sent
to
many
of
his
dearest
friends
to
be
used
as
seals
or
rings
and
kept
as
memorials
of
him
and
of
his
affection
to
them
his
dear
friends
and
benefactors
sir
henry
goodier
and
sir
robert
drewry
could
not
be
of
that
number
nor
could
the
lady
magdalen
herbert
the
mother
of
george
herbert
for
they
had
put
off
mortality
and
taken
possession
of
the
grave
before
him
but
sir
henry
wotton
and
hall
the
then
late
deceased
bishop
of
norwich
were
and
so
were
duppa
bishop
of
salisbury
and
henry
king
bishop
of
chichester
lately
deceased
men
in
whom
there
was
such
a
commixture
of
general
learning
of
natural
eloquence
and
christian
humility
that
they
deserve
a
commemoration
by
a
pen
equal
to
their
own
which
none
have
exceeded
and
in
this
enumeration
of
his
friends
though
many
must
be
omitted
yet
that
man
of
primitive
piety
george
herbert
may
not
i
mean
that
george
herbert
who
was
the
author
of
the
temple
or
sacred
poems
and
ejaculations
a
book
in
which
by
declaring
his
own
spiritual
conflicts
he
hath
comforted
and
raised
many
a
dejected
and
discomposed
soul
and
charmed
them
into
sweet
and
quiet
thoughts
a
book
by
the
frequent
reading
whereof
and
the
assistance
of
that
spirit
that
seemed
to
inspire
the
author
the
reader
may
attain
habits
of
peace
and
piety
and
all
the
gifts
of
the
holy
ghost
and
heaven
and
may
by
still
reading
still
keep
those
sacred
fires
burning
upon
the
altar
of
so
pure
a
heart
as
shall
free
it
from
the
anxieties
of
this
world
and
keep
it
fixed
upon
things
that
are
above
betwixt
this
george
herbert
and
donne
there
was
a
long
and
dear
friendship
made
up
by
such
a
sympathy
of
inclinations
that
they
coveted
and
joyed
to
be
in
each
company
and
this
happy
friendship
was
still
maintained
by
many
sacred
endearments
of
which
that
which
followeth
may
be
some
testimony
to
george
herbert
sent
him
with
one
of
my
seals
of
the
anchor
and
christ
illustration
sheaf
of
snakes
used
heretofore
to
be
my
seal
which
is
the
crest
of
our
poor
illustration
qui
prius
assuetus
serpentum
falce
tabellas
signare
hæc
nostræ
symbola
parva
domus
adscitus
domui
domini
adopted
in
god
family
and
so
my
old
coat
lost
into
new
arms
i
go
the
cross
my
seal
in
baptism
spread
below
does
by
that
form
into
an
anchor
grow
crosses
grow
anchors
bear
as
thou
shouldst
do
thy
cross
and
that
cross
grows
an
anchor
too
but
he
that
makes
our
crosses
anchors
thus
is
christ
who
there
is
crucified
for
us
yet
with
this
i
may
my
first
serpents
hold
god
gives
new
blessings
and
yet
leaves
the
old
the
serpent
may
as
wise
my
pattern
be
my
poison
as
he
feeds
on
dust
that
me
and
as
he
rounds
the
earth
to
murder
sure
he
is
my
death
but
on
the
cross
my
cure
crucify
nature
then
and
then
implore
all
grace
from
him
crucified
there
before
when
all
is
cross
and
that
cross
anchor
grown
this
seal
a
catechism
not
a
seal
alone
under

george
herbert
i
return
to
tell
the
reader
that
besides
these
verses
to
his
dear
herbert
and
that
hymn
that
i
mentioned
to
be
sung
in
the
choir
of
paul
church
he
did
also
shorten
and
beguile
many
sad
hours
by
composing
other
sacred
ditties
and
he
writ
an
hymn
on
his
which
bears
this
title
an
hymn
to
god
my
god
in
my
sickness
since
i
am
coming
to
that
holy
room
where
with
thy
choir
of
saints
for
evermore
i
shall
be
made
thy
music
as
i
come
i
tune
my
instrument
here
at
the
door
and
what
i
must
do
then
think
here
before
since
my
physicians
by
their
loves
are
grown
cosmographers
and
i
their
map
who
lie
flat
on
this
bed
so
in
his
purple
wrapt
receive
my
lord
by
these
his
thorns
give
me
his
other
crown
and
as
to
other
souls
i
preach
thy
word
be
this
my
text
my
sermon
to
mine
own
he
may
raise
therefore
the
lord
throws
down
if
these
fall
under
the
censure
of
a
soul
whose
too
much
mixture
with
earth
makes
it
unfit
to
judge
of
these
high
raptures
and
illuminations
let
him
know
that
many
holy
and
devout
men
have
thought
the
soul
of
prudentius
to
be
most
refined
when
not
many
days
before
his
death
he
charged
it
to
present
his
god
each
morning
and
evening
with
a
new
and
spiritual
song
justified
by
the
example
of
king
david
and
the
good
king
hezekiah
who
upon
the
renovation
of
his
years
paid
his
thankful
vows
to
almighty
god
in
a
royal
hymn
which
he
concludes
in
these
words
the
lord
was
ready
to
save
therefore
i
will
sing
my
songs
to
the
stringed
instruments
all
the
days
of
my
life
in
the
temple
of
my
god
the
latter
part
of
his
life
may
be
said
to
be
a
continued
study
for
as
he
usually
preached
once
a
week
if
not
oftener
so
after
his
sermon
he
never
gave
his
eyes
rest
till
he
had
chosen
out
a
new
text
and
that
night
cast
his
sermon
into
a
form
and
his
text
into
divisions
and
the
next
day
betook
himself
to
consult
the
fathers
and
so
commit
his
meditations
to
his
memory
which
was
excellent
but
upon
saturday
he
usually
gave
himself
and
his
mind
a
rest
from
the
weary
burthen
of
his
week
meditations
and
usually
spent
that
day
in
visitation
of
friends
or
some
other
diversions
of
his
thoughts
and
would
say
that
he
gave
both
his
body
and
mind
that
refreshment
that
he
might
be
enabled
to
do
the
work
of
the
day
following
not
faintly
but
with
courage
and
cheerfulness
nor
was
his
age
only
so
industrious
but
in
the
most
unsettled
days
of
his
youth
his
bed
was
not
able
to
detain
him
beyond
the
hour
of
four
in
a
morning
and
it
was
no
common
business
that
drew
him
out
of
his
chamber
till
past
ten
all
which
time
was
employed
in
study
though
he
took
great
liberty
after
it
and
if
this
seem
strange
it
may
gain
a
belief
by
the
visible
fruits
of
his
labours
some
of
which
remain
as
testimonies
of
what
is
here
written
for
he
left
the
resultance
of
authors
most
of
them
abridged
and
analysed
with
his
own
hand
he
left
also
six
score
of
his
sermons
all
written
with
his
own
hand
also
an
exact
and
laborious
treatise
concerning
called
biathanatos
wherein
all
the
laws
violated
by
that
act
are
diligently
surveyed
and
judiciously
censured
a
treatise
written
in
his
younger
days
which
alone
might
declare
him
then
not
only
perfect
in
the
civil
and
canon
law
but
in
many
other
such
studies
and
arguments
as
enter
not
into
the
consideration
of
many
that
labour
to
be
thought
great
clerks
and
pretend
to
know
all
things
nor
were
these
only
found
in
his
study
but
all
businesses
that
passed
of
any
public
consequence
either
in
this
or
any
of
our
he
abbreviated
either
in
latin
or
in
the
language
of
that
nation
and
kept
them
by
him
for
useful
memorials
so
he
did
the
copies
of
divers
letters
and
cases
of
conscience
that
had
concerned
his
friends
with
his
observations
and
solutions
of
them
and
divers
other
businesses
of
importance
all
particularly
and
methodically
digested
by
himself
he
did
prepare
to
leave
the
world
before
life
left
him
making
his
will
when
no
faculty
of
his
soul
was
damped
or
made
defective
by
pain
or
sickness
or
he
surprised
by
a
sudden
apprehension
of
death
but
it
was
made
with
mature
deliberation
expressing
himself
an
impartial
father
by
making
his
children
portions
equal
and
a
lover
of
his
friends
whom
he
remembered
with
legacies
fitly
and
discreetly
chosen
and
bequeathed
i
can
not
forbear
a
nomination
of
some
of
them
for
methinks
they
be
persons
that
seem
to
challenge
a
recordation
in
this
place
as
namely
to
his
sir
thomas
grimes
he
gave
that
striking
clock
which
he
had
long
worn
in
his
pocket
to
his
dear
friend
and
executor
king
late
bishop
of
chichester
that
model
of
gold
of
the
synod
of
dort
with
which
the
states
presented
him
at
his
last
being
at
the
hague
and
the
two
pictures
of
padre
paolo
and
fulgentio
men
of
his
acquaintance
when
he
travelled
italy
and
of
great
note
in
that
nation
for
their
remarkable
to
his
ancient
friend
brook
that
married
him
master
of
trinity
college
in
cambridge
he
gave
the
picture
of
the
blessed
virgin
and
to
winniff
who
succeeded
him
in
the
deanery
he
gave
a
picture
called
the
to
the
succeeding
dean
who
was
not
then
known
he
gave
many
necessaries
of
worth
and
useful
for
his
house
and
also
several
pictures
and
ornaments
for
the
chapel
with
a
desire
that
they
might
be
registered
and
remain
as
a
legacy
to
his
to
the
earls
of
dorset
and
carlisle
he
gave
several
pictures
and
so
he
did
to
many
other
friends
legacies
given
rather
to
express
his
affection
than
to
make
any
addition
to
their
estates
but
unto
the
poor
he
was
full
of
charity
and
unto
many
others
who
by
his
constant
and
long
continued
bounty
might
entitle
themselves
to
be
his
for
all
these
he
made
provision
and
so
largely
as
having
then
six
children
living
might
to
some
appear
more
than
proportionable
to
his
estate
i
forbear
to
mention
any
more
lest
the
reader
may
think
i
trespass
upon
his
patience
but
i
will
beg
his
favour
to
present
him
with
the
beginning
and
end
of
his
will
in
the
name
of
the
blessed
and
glorious
trinity
amen
i
john
donne
by
the
mercy
of
christ
jesus
and
by
the
calling
of
the
church
of
england
priest
being
at
this
time
in
good
health
and
perfect
understanding
praised
be
god
therefore
do
hereby
make
my
last
will
and
testament
in
manner
and
form
following
first
i
give
my
gracious
god
an
entire
sacrifice
of
body
and
soul
with
my
most
humble
thanks
for
that
assurance
which
his
blessed
spirit
imprints
in
me
now
of
the
salvation
of
the
one
and
the
resurrection
of
the
other
and
for
that
constant
and
cheerful
resolution
which
the
same
spirit
hath
established
in
me
to
live
and
die
in
the
religion
now
professed
in
the
church
of
england
in
expectation
of
that
resurrection
i
desire
my
body
may
be
buried
in
the
most
private
manner
that
may
be
in
that
place
of
paul
church
london
that
the
now
residentiaries
have
at
my
request
designed
for
that
purpose
and
this
my
last
will
and
testament
made
in
the
fear
of
god
whose
mercy
i
humbly
beg
and
constantly
rely
upon
in
jesus
christ
and
in
perfect
love
and
charity
with
all
the
world
whose
pardon
i
ask
from
the
lowest
of
my
servants
to
the
highest
of
my
superiors
written
all
with
my
own
hand
and
my
name
subscribed
to
every
page
of
which
there
are
five
in
number
sealed
december
nor
was
this
blessed
sacrifice
of
charity
expressed
only
at
his
death
but
in
his
life
also
by
a
cheerful
and
frequent
visitation
of
any
friend
whose
mind
was
dejected
or
his
fortune
necessitous
he
was
inquisitive
after
the
wants
of
prisoners
and
redeemed
many
from
prison
that
lay
for
their
fees
or
small
debts
he
was
a
continual
giver
to
poor
scholars
both
of
this
and
foreign
nations
besides
what
he
gave
with
his
own
hand
he
usually
sent
a
servant
or
a
discreet
and
trusty
friend
to
distribute
his
charity
to
all
the
prisons
in
london
at
all
the
festival
times
of
the
year
especially
at
the
birth
and
resurrection
of
our
saviour
he
gave
an
hundred
pounds
at
one
time
to
an
old
friend
whom
he
had
known
live
plentifully
and
by
a
too
liberal
heart
and
carelessness
became
decayed
in
his
estate
and
when
the
receiving
of
it
was
denied
by
the
gentleman
saying
he
wanted
not
for
the
reader
may
note
that
as
there
be
some
spirits
so
generous
as
to
labour
to
conceal
and
endure
a
sad
poverty
rather
than
expose
themselves
to
those
blushes
that
attend
the
confession
of
it
so
there
be
others
to
whom
nature
and
grace
have
afforded
such
sweet
and
compassionate
souls
as
to
pity
and
prevent
the
distresses
of
mankind
which
i
have
mentioned
because
of
donne
reply
whose
answer
was
i
know
you
want
not
what
will
sustain
nature
for
a
little
will
do
that
but
my
desire
is
that
you
who
in
the
days
of
your
plenty
have
cheered
and
raised
the
hearts
of
so
many
of
your
dejected
friends
would
now
receive
this
from
me
and
use
it
as
a
cordial
for
the
cheering
of
your
own
and
upon
these
terms
it
was
received
he
was
an
happy
reconciler
of
many
differences
in
the
families
of
his
friends
and
kindred
which
he
never
undertook
faintly
for
such
undertakings
have
usually
faint
effects
and
they
had
such
a
faith
in
his
judgment
and
impartiality
that
he
never
advised
them
to
any
thing
in
vain
he
was
even
to
her
death
a
most
dutiful
son
to
his
mother
careful
to
provide
for
her
supportation
of
which
she
had
been
destitute
but
that
god
raised
him
up
to
prevent
her
necessities
who
having
sucked
in
the
religion
of
the
roman
church
with
the
mother
milk
spent
her
estate
in
foreign
countries
to
enjoy
a
liberty
in
it
and
died
in
his
house
but
three
months
before
him
and
to
the
end
it
may
appear
how
just
a
steward
he
was
of
his
lord
and
master
revenue
i
have
thought
fit
to
let
the
reader
know
that
after
his
entrance
into
his
deanery
as
he
numbered
his
years
he
at
the
foot
of
a
private
account
to
which
god
and
his
angels
were
only
witnesses
with
him
computed
first
his
revenue
then
what
was
given
to
the
poor
and
other
pious
uses
and
lastly
what
rested
for
him
and
his
and
having
done
that
he
then
blessed
each
year
poor
remainder
with
a
thankful
prayer
which
for
that
they
discover
a
more
than
common
devotion
the
reader
shall
partake
some
of
them
in
his
own
words
so
all
is
that
remains
this
year
deo
opt
max
benigno
largitori
á
me
at
ab
iis
quibus
hæc
à
me
reservantur

amen
translated
thus
to
god
all
good
all
great
the
benevolent

me
and
by
them
for
whom
by
me
these
sums
are
laid
up
be
glory
and

ascribed
for
ever
amen
so
that
this
year
god
hath
blessed
me
and
mine
with
multiplicatæ

thus
thy
mercies
oh
lord
are
multiplied
upon
us

translated
thus
grant
oh
lord
that
what
out
of
thine
infinite
bounty
thou
hast
vouchsafed
to
lavish
upon
us
into
whosoever
hands
it
may
devolve
may
always
be
improved
to
thy
glory

translated
thus
at
the
end
of
these
six
years
remains
what
have
i
which
i
have
not
received
from
the
lord
he
bestows
also
to
the
intent
that
what
he
hath
bestowed
may
revert
to
him
by
the
proper
use
of
it
that
as
i
have
not
consciously
been
wanting
to
myself
during
the
whole
course
of
the
past
year
either
in
discharging
my
secular
duties
in
retaining
the
dignity
of
my
station
or
in
my
conduct
towards
my
servants
and
the
poor
so
my
children
for
whom
remains
whatever
is
remaining
may
receive
it
with
gratitude
and
acknowledge
the
beneficent
giver
amen
but
i
return
from
my
long
digression
we
left
the
author
sick
in
essex
where
he
was
forced
to
spend
much
of
that
winter
by
reason
of
his
disability
to
remove
from
that
place
and
having
never
for
almost
twenty
years
omitted
his
personal
attendance
on
his
majesty
in
that
month
in
which
he
was
to
attend
and
preach
to
him
nor
having
ever
been
left
out
of
the
roll
and
number
of
lent
preachers
and
there
being
then
in
january
a
report
brought
to
london
or
raised
there
that
donne
was
dead
that
report
gave
him
occasion
to
write
the
following
letter
to
a
dear
friend
sir
this
advantage
you
and
my
other
friends
have
by
my
frequent
fevers
that
i
am
so
much
the
oftener
at
the
gates
of
heaven
and
this
advantage
by
the
solitude
and
close
imprisonment
that
they
reduce
me
to
after
that
i
am
so
much
the
oftener
at
my
prayers
in
which
i
shall
never
leave
out
your
happiness
and
i
doubt
not
among
his
other
blessings
god
will
add
some
one
to
you
for
my
prayers
a
man
would
almost
be
content
to
die
if
there
were
no
other
benefit
in
death
to
hear
of
so
much
sorrow
and
so
much
good
testimony
from
good
men
as
i
god
be
blessed
for
it
did
upon
the
report
of
my
death
yet
i
perceive
it
went
not
through
all
for
one
writ
to
me
that
some
and
he
said
of
my
friends
conceived
i
was
not
so
ill
as
i
pretended
but
withdrew
myself
to
live
at
ease
discharged
of
preaching
it
is
an
unfriendly
and
god
knows
an
interpretation
for
i
have
always
been
sorrier
when
i
could
not
preach
than
any
could
be
they
could
not
hear
me
it
hath
been
my
desire
and
god
may
be
pleased
to
grant
it
that
i
might
die
in
the
pulpit
if
not
that
yet
that
i
might
take
my
death
in
the
pulpit
that
is
die
the
sooner
by
occasion
of
those
labours
sir
i
hope
to
see
you
presently
after
candlemas
about
which
time
will
fall
my
lent
sermon
at
court
except
my
lord
chamberlain
believe
me
to
be
dead
and
so
leave
me
out
of
the
roll
but
as
long
as
i
live
and
am
not
speechless
i
would
not
willingly
decline
that
service
i
have
better
leisure
to
write
than

to
read
yet
i
would
not
willingly
oppress
you
with
too
much
letter

so
bless
you
and
your
son
as
i
wish
to
your
poor
friend

servant

j
donne
before
that
month
ended
he
was
appointed
to
preach
upon
his
old
constant
day
the
first
friday
in
lent
he
had
notice
of
it
and
had
in
his
sickness
so
prepared
for
that
employment
that
as
he
had
long
thirsted
for
it
so
he
resolved
his
weakness
should
not
hinder
his
journey
he
came
therefore
to
london
some
few
days
before
his
appointed
day
of
preaching
at
his
coming
thither
many
of
his
friends
who
with
sorrow
saw
his
sickness
had
left
him
but
so
much
flesh
as
did
only
cover
his
bones
doubted
his
strength
to
perform
that
task
and
did
therefore
dissuade
him
from
undertaking
it
assuring
him
however
it
was
like
to
shorten
his
life
but
he
passionately
denied
their
requests
saying
he
would
not
doubt
that
that
god
who
in
so
many
weaknesses
had
assisted
him
with
an
unexpected
strength
would
now
withdraw
it
in
his
last
employment
professing
an
holy
ambition
to
perform
that
sacred
work
and
when
to
the
amazement
of
some
beholders
he
appeared
in
the
pulpit
many
of
them
thought
he
presented
himself
not
to
preach
mortification
by
a
living
voice
but
mortality
by
a
decayed
body
and
a
dying
face
and
doubtless
many
did
secretly
ask
that
question
in
ezekiel
chap
xxxvii
do
these
bones
live
or
can
that
soul
organise
that
tongue
to
speak
so
long
time
as
the
sand
in
that
glass
will
move
towards
its
centre
and
measure
out
an
hour
of
this
dying
man
unspent
life
doubtless
it
can
not
and
yet
after
some
faint
pauses
in
his
zealous
prayer
his
strong
desires
enabled
his
weak
body
to
discharge
his
memory
of
his
preconceived
meditations
which
were
of
dying
the
text
being
to
god
the
lord
belong
the
issues
from
death
many
that
then
saw
his
tears
and
heard
his
faint
and
hollow
voice
professing
they
thought
the
text
prophetically
chosen
and
that
donne
had
preached
his
own
funeral
sermon
being
full
of
joy
that
god
had
enabled
him
to
perform
this
desired
duty
he
hastened
to
his
house
out
of
which
he
never
moved
till
like
stephen
he
was
carried
by
devout
men
to
his
grave
the
next
day
after
his
sermon
his
strength
being
much
wasted
and
his
spirits
so
spent
as
indisposed
him
to
business
or
to
talk
a
friend
that
had
often
been
a
witness
of
his
free
and
facetious
discourse
asked
him
why
are
you
sad
to
whom
he
replied
with
a
countenance
so
full
of
cheerful
gravity
as
gave
testimony
of
an
inward
tranquillity
of
mind
and
of
a
soul
willing
to
take
a
farewell
of
this
world
and
said
i
am
not
sad
but
most
of
the
night
past
i
have
entertained
myself
with
many
thoughts
of
several
friends
that
have
left
me
here
and
are
gone
to
that
place
from
which
they
shall
not
return
and
that
within
a
few
days
i
also
shall
go
hence
and
be
no
more
seen
and
my
preparation
for
this
change
is
become
my
nightly
meditation
upon
my
bed
which
my
infirmities
have
now
made
restless
to
me
but
at
this
present
time
i
was
in
a
serious
contemplation
of
the
providence
and
goodness
of
god
to
me
to
me
who
am
less
than
the
least
of
his
mercies
and
looking
back
upon
my
life
past
i
now
plainly
see
it
was
his
hand
that
prevented
me
from
all
temporal
employment
and
that
it
was
his
will
i
should
never
settle
nor
thrive
till
i
entered
into
the
ministry
in
which
i
have
now
lived
almost
twenty
years
i
hope
to
his
glory
and
by
which
i
most
humbly
thank
him
i
have
been
enabled
to
requite
most
of
those
friends
which
shewed
me
kindness
when
my
fortune
was
very
low
as
god
knows
it
was
and
as
it
hath
occasioned
the
expression
of
my
gratitude
i
thank
god
most
of
them
have
stood
in
need
of
my
requital
i
have
lived
to
be
useful
and
comfortable
to
my
good
sir
george
more
whose
patience
god
hath
been
pleased
to
exercise
with
many
temporal
crosses
i
have
maintained
my
own
mother
whom
it
hath
pleased
god
after
a
plentiful
fortune
in
her
younger
days
to
bring
to
great
decay
in
her
very
old
age
i
have
quieted
the
consciences
of
many
that
have
groaned
under
the
burden
of
a
wounded
spirit
whose
prayers
i
hope
are
available
for
me
i
can
not
plead
innocency
of
life
especially
of
my
youth
but
i
am
to
be
judged
by
a
merciful
god
who
is
not
willing
to
see
what
i
have
done
amiss
and
though
of
myself
i
have
nothing
to
present
to
him
but
sins
and
misery
yet
i
know
he
looks
not
upon
me
now
as
i
am
of
myself
but
as
i
am
in
my
saviour
and
hath
given
me
even
at
this
present
time
some
testimonies
by
his
holy
spirit
that
i
am
of
the
number
of
his
elect
i
am
therefore
full
of
inexpressible
joy
and
shall
die
in
peace
i
must
here
look
so
far
back
as
to
tell
the
reader
that
at
his
first
return
out
of
essex
to
preach
his
last
sermon
his
old
friend
and
physician
fox
a
man
of
great
worth
came
to
him
to
consult
his
health
and
that
after
a
sight
of
him
and
some
queries
concerning
his
distempers
he
told
him
that
by
cordials
and
drinking
milk
twenty
days
together
there
was
a
probability
of
his
restoration
to
health
but
he
passionately
denied
to
drink
it
nevertheless
fox
who
loved
him
most
entirely
wearied
him
with
solicitations
till
he
yielded
to
take
it
for
ten
days
at
the
end
of
which
time
he
told
fox
he
had
drunk
it
more
to
satisfy
him
than
to
recover
his
health
and
that
he
would
not
drink
it
ten
days
longer
upon
the
best
moral
assurance
of
having
twenty
years
added
to
his
life
for
he
loved
it
not
and
was
so
far
from
fearing
death
which
to
others
is
the
king
of
terrors
that
he
longed
for
the
day
of
his
dissolution
it
is
observed
that
a
desire
of
glory
or
commendation
is
rooted
in
the
very
nature
of
man
and
that
those
of
the
severest
and
most
mortified
lives
though
they
may
become
so
humble
as
to
banish
and
such
weeds
as
naturally
grow
there
yet
they
have
not
been
able
to
kill
this
desire
of
glory
but
that
like
our
radical
heat
it
will
both
live
and
die
with
us
and
many
think
it
should
do
so
and
we
want
not
sacred
examples
to
justify
the
desire
of
having
our
memory
to
outlive
our
lives
which
i
mention
because
donne
by
the
persuasion
of
fox
easily
yielded
at
this
very
time
to
have
a
monument
made
for
him
but
fox
undertook
not
to
persuade
him
how
or
what
monument
it
should
be
that
was
left
to
donne
himself
a
monument
being
resolved
upon
donne
sent
for
a
carver
to
make
for
him
in
wood
the
figure
of
an
urn
giving
him
directions
for
the
compass
and
height
of
it
and
to
bring
with
it
a
board
of
the
just
height
of
his
body
these
being
got
then
without
delay
a
choice
painter
was
got
to
be
in
readiness
to
draw
his
picture
which
was
taken
as
several
charcoal
fires
being
first
made
in
his
large
study
he
brought
with
him
into
that
place
his
in
his
hand
and
having
put
off
all
his
clothes
had
this
sheet
put
on
him
and
so
tied
with
knots
at
his
head
and
feet
and
his
hands
so
placed
as
dead
bodies
are
usually
fitted
to
be
shrouded
and
put
into
their
coffin
or
grave
upon
this
urn
he
thus
stood
with
his
eyes
shut
and
with
so
much
of
the
sheet
turned
aside
as
might
shew
his
lean
pale
and
face
which
was
purposely
turned
towards
the
east
from
whence
he
expected
the
second
coming
of
his
and
our
saviour
jesus
in
this
posture
he
was
drawn
at
his
just
height
and
when
the
picture
was
fully
finished
he
caused
it
to
be
set
by
his
bedside
where
it
continued
and
became
his
hourly
object
till
his
death
and
was
then
given
to
his
dearest
friend
and
executor
henry
king
then
chief
residentiary
of
paul
who
caused
him
to
be
thus
carved
in
one
entire
piece
of
white
marble
as
it
now
stands
in
that
church
and
by
donne
own
appointment
these
words
were
to
be
affixed
to
it
as
an
epitaph

and
now
having
brought
him
through
the
many
labyrinths
and
perplexities
of
a
various
life
even
to
the
gates
of
death
and
the
grave
my
desire
is
he
may
rest
till
i
have
told
my
reader
that
i
have
seen
many
pictures
of
him
in
several
habits
and
at
several
ages
and
in
several
postures
and
i
now
mention
this
because
i
have
seen
one
picture
of
him
drawn
by
a
curious
hand
at
his
age
of
eighteen
with
his
sword
and
what
other
adornments
might
then
suit
with
the
present
fashions
of
youth
and
the
giddy
gaieties
of
that
age
and
his
motto
then
was
how
much
shall
i
be
changed
before
i
am
changed
and
if
that
young
and
his
now
dying
picture
were
at
this
time
set
together
every
beholder
might
say
lord
how
much
is
donne
already
changed
before
he
is
changed
and
the
view
of
them
might
give
my
reader
occasion
to
ask
himself
with
some
amazement
lord
how
much
may
i
also
that
am
now
in
health
be
changed
before
i
am
changed
before
this
vile
this
changeable
body
shall
put
off
mortality
and
therefore
to
prepare
for
but
this
is
not
writ
so
much
for
my
memento
as
to
tell
him
that
donne
would
often
in
his
private
discourses
and
often
publicly
in
his
sermons
mention
the
many
changes
both
of
his
body
and
mind
especially
of
his
mind
from
a
vertiginous
giddiness
and
would
as
often
say
his
great
and
most
blessed
change
was
from
a
temporal
to
a
spiritual
employment
in
which
he
was
so
happy
that
he
accounted
the
former
part
of
his
life
to
be
lost
and
the
beginning
of
it
to
be
from
his
first
entering
into
sacred
orders
and
serving
his
most
merciful
god
at
his
altar
upon
monday
after
the
drawing
this
picture
he
took
his
last
leave
of
his
beloved
study
and
being
sensible
of
his
hourly
decay
retired
himself
to
his
bedchamber
and
that
week
sent
at
several
times
for
many
of
his
most
considerable
friends
with
whom
he
took
a
solemn
and
deliberate
farewell
commending
to
their
considerations
some
sentences
useful
for
the
regulation
of
their
lives
and
then
dismissed
them
as
good
jacob
did
his
sons
with
a
spiritual
benediction
the
sunday
following
he
appointed
his
servants
that
if
there
were
any
business
yet
undone
that
concerned
him
or
themselves
it
should
be
prepared
against
saturday
next
for
after
that
day
he
would
not
mix
his
thoughts
with
any
thing
that
concerned
this
world
nor
ever
did
but
as
job
so
he
waited
for
the
appointed
day
of
his
dissolution
and
now
he
was
so
happy
as
to
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
die
to
do
which
he
stood
in
need
of
no
longer
time
for
he
had
studied
it
long
and
to
so
happy
a
perfection
that
in
a
former
sickness
he
called
god
to
witness
in
his
book
of
devotions
written
then
he
was
that
minute
ready
to
deliver
his
soul
into
his
hands
if
that
minute
god
would
determine
his
dissolution
in
that
sickness
he
begged
of
god
the
constancy
to
be
preserved
in
that
estate
for
ever
and
his
patient
expectation
to
have
his
immortal
soul
disrobed
from
her
garment
of
mortality
makes
me
confident
that
he
now
had
a
modest
assurance
that
his
prayers
were
then
heard
and
his
petition
granted
he
lay
fifteen
days
earnestly
expecting
his
hourly
change
and
in
the
last
hour
of
his
last
day
as
his
body
melted
away
and
vapoured
into
spirit
his
soul
having
i
verily
believe
some
revelation
of
the
beatifical
vision
he
said
i
were
miserable
if
i
might
not
die
and
after
those
words
closed
many
periods
of
his
faint
breath
by
saying
often
thy
kingdom
come
thy
will
be
done
his
speech
which
had
long
been
his
ready
and
faithful
servant
left
him
not
till
the
last
minute
of
his
life
and
then
forsook
him
not
to
serve
another
master
for
who
speaks
like
him
but
died
before
him
for
that
it
was
then
become
useless
to
him
that
now
conversed
with
god
on
earth
as
angels
are
said
to
do
in
heaven
only
by
thoughts
and
looks
being
speechless
and
seeing
heaven
by
that
illumination
by
which
he
saw
it
he
did
as
stephen
look
stedfastly
into
it
till
he
saw
the
son
of
man
standing
at
the
right
hand
of
god
his
father
and
being
satisfied
with
this
blessed
sight
as
his
soul
ascended
and
his
last
breath
departed
from
him
he
closed
his
own
eyes
and
then
disposed
his
hands
and
body
into
such
a
posture
as
required
not
the
least
alteration
by
those
that
came
to
shroud
him
thus
variable
thus
virtuous
was
the
life
thus
excellent
thus
exemplary
was
the
death
of
this
memorable
man
he
was
buried
in
that
place
of
paul
church
which
he
had
appointed
for
that
use
some
years
before
his
death
and
by
which
he
passed
daily
to
pay
his
public
devotions
to
almighty
god
who
was
then
served
twice
a
day
by
a
public
form
of
prayer
and
praises
in
that
place
but
he
was
not
buried
privately
though
he
desired
it
for
beside
an
unnumbered
number
of
others
many
persons
of
nobility
and
of
eminence
for
learning
who
did
love
and
honour
him
in
his
life
did
show
it
at
his
death
by
a
voluntary
and
sad
attendance
of
his
body
to
the
grave
where
nothing
was
so
remarkable
as
a
public
sorrow
to
which
place
of
his
burial
some
mournful
friends
repaired
and
as
alexander
the
great
did
to
the
grave
of
the
famous
achilles
so
they
strewed
his
with
an
abundance
of
curious
and
costly
flowers
which
course
they
who
were
never
yet
known
continued
morning
and
evening
for
many
days
not
ceasing
till
the
stones
that
were
taken
up
in
that
church
to
give
his
body
admission
into
the
cold
earth
now
his
bed
of
rest
were
again
by
the
mason
art
so
levelled
and
firmed
as
they
had
been
formerly
and
his
place
of
burial
undistinguishable
to
common
view
the
next
day
after
his
burial
some
unknown
friend
some
one
of
the
many
lovers
and
admirers
of
his
virtue
and
learning
writ
this
epitaph
with
a
coal
on
the
wall
over
his
grave
reader
i
am
to
let
thee
know
donne
body
only
lies
below
for
could
the
grave
his
soul
comprise
earth
would
be
richer
than
the
skies
nor
was
this
all
the
honour
done
to
his
reverend
ashes
for
as
there
be
some
persons
that
will
not
receive
a
reward
for
that
for
which
god
accounts
himself
a
debtor
persons
that
dare
trust
god
with
their
charity
and
without
a
witness
so
there
was
by
some
grateful
unknown
friend
that
thought
donne
memory
ought
to
be
perpetuated
an
hundred
marks
sent
to
his
faithful
friends
and
executors
king
and
montford
towards
the
making
of
his
monument
it
was
not
for
many
years
known
by
whom
but
after
the
death
of
fox
it
was
known
that
it
was
he
that
sent
it
and
he
lived
to
see
as
lively
a
representation
of
his
dead
friend
as
marble
can
express
a
statue
indeed
so
like
donne
that
as
his
friend
sir
henry
wotton
hath
expressed
himself
it
seems
to
breathe
faintly
and
posterity
shall
look
upon
it
as
a
kind
of
artificial
miracle
he
was
of
stature
moderately
tall
of
a
straight
and
body
to
which
all
his
words
and
actions
gave
an
unexpressible
addition
of
comeliness
the
melancholy
and
pleasant
humour
were
in
him
so
contempered
that
each
gave
advantage
to
the
other
and
made
his
company
one
of
the
delights
of
mankind
his
fancy
was
unimitably
high
equalled
only
by
his
great
wit
both
being
made
useful
by
a
commanding
judgment
his
aspect
was
cheerful
and
such
as
gave
a
silent
testimony
of
a
clear
knowing
soul
and
of
a
conscience
at
peace
with
itself
his
melting
eye
showed
that
he
had
a
soft
heart
full
of
noble
compassion
of
too
brave
a
soul
to
offer
injuries
and
too
much
a
christian
not
to
pardon
them
in
others
he
did
much
contemplate
especially
after
he
entered
into
his
sacred
calling
the
mercies
of
almighty
god
the
immortality
of
the
soul
and
the
joys
of
heaven
and
would
often
say
in
a
kind
of
sacred
ecstacy
blessed
be
god
that
he
is
god
only
and
divinely
like
himself
he
was
by
nature
highly
passionate
but
more
apt
to
reluct
at
the
excesses
of
it
a
great
lover
of
the
offices
of
humanity
and
of
so
merciful
a
spirit
that
he
never
beheld
the
miseries
of
mankind
without
pity
and
relief
he
was
earnest
and
unwearied
in
the
search
of
knowledge
with
which
his
vigorous
soul
is
now
satisfied
and
employed
in
a
continual
praise
of
that
god
that
first
breathed
it
into
his
active
body
that
body
which
once
was
a
temple
of
the
holy
ghost
and
is
now

a

he
a

that
he
hath
enough
in
himself
not

to
destroy
and
execute
himself
but
to
presage
that
execution
upon
himself
to
assist
the
sickness
to
antedate
the
sickness
to
make
the
sickness
the
more
irremediable
by
sad
apprehensions
and
as
if
he
would
make
a
fire
the
more
vehement
by
sprinkling
water
upon

to
wrap

hot

i
were

to
beat
at
the
approach
of
a
temptation
to
sin
why
are
there
not
always
waters
in
mine
eyes
to
testify
my
spiritual
sickness

stand
in

of
temptations
naturally

do
so
for
there
is
a
snake
in

path
temptations
in

vocation
but
i
go
i
run
i
fly
into
the
ways
of
temptation
which
i
might
shun
nay
i
break
into
houses
where
the
plague
is
i
press
into
places
of
temptation
and
tempt
the
devil
himself
and
solicit
and
importune
them
who
had
rather
be
left
unsolicited
by
me
i
fall
sick
of
sin
and
am
bedded
and
bedrid
buried
and
putrified
in
the
practice
of
sin
and
all
this
while
have
no
presage
no
pulse
no
sense
of
my
sickness
o
height
o
depth
of
misery
where
the
first
symptom
of
the
sickness
is
hell
and
where
i
never
see
the
fever
of
lust
of
envy
of
ambition
by
any
other
light
than
the
darkness
and
horror
of
hell
itself
and
where
the
first
messenger
that
speaks
to
me
doth
not
say
thou
mayest
die
no
nor
thou
must
die
but
thou
art
dead
and
where
the
first
notice
that
my
soul
hath
of
her
sickness
is
irrecoverableness
irremediableness
but
o
my
god
job
did
not
charge
thee
foolishly
in
his
temporal
afflictions
nor
may
i
in
my
spiritual
thou
hast
imprinted
a
pulse
in
our
soul
but
we
do
not
examine
it
a
voice
in
our
conscience
but
we
do
not
hearken
unto
it
we
talk
it
out
we
jest
it
out
we
drink
it
out
we
sleep
it
out
and
when
we
wake
we
do
not
say
with
jacob
the
lord
is
in
this
place
and
i
knew
it
but
though
we
might
know
it
we
do
not
we
will
not
but
will
god
pretend
to
make
a
watch
and
leave
out
the
spring
to
make
so
many
various
wheels
in
the
faculties
of
the
soul
and
in
the
organs
of
the
body
and
leave
out
grace
that
should
move
them
or
will
god
make
a
spring
and
not
wind
it
up
infuse
his
first
grace
and
not
second
it
with
more
without
which
we
can
no
more
use
his
first
grace
when
we
have
it
than
we
could
dispose
ourselves
by
nature
to
have
it
but
alas
that
is
not
our
case
we
are
all
prodigal
sons
and
not
disinherited
we
have
received
our
portion
and
mispent

tenants

our

pays
us

not

hourly
and
quarterly
every

renews
his

art
a
direct
line

us
from

beginning
through
all
our
ways
to

end
enable
me
by
thy
grace
to
look
forward
to
mine
end
and
to
look
backward
too

the
considerations
of
thy

afforded
me
from

so
by
that
practice
of
considering
thy
mercy
in
my
beginning
in
this
world
when
thou
plantedst
me
in
the
christian
church
and
thy
mercy
in
the
beginning
in
the
other
world
when
thou
writest
me
in
the
book
of
life
in
my
election
i
may
come
to
a
holy
consideration
of
thy
mercy
in
the
beginning
of
all
my
actions
here
that
in
all
the
beginnings
in
all
the
accesses
and
approaches
of
spiritual
sicknesses
of
sin
i
may
hear
and
hearken
to
that
voice
thou
man
of
god
there
is
death
in
the
and
so
refrain
from
that
which
i
was
so
hungerly
so
greedily
flying
to
faithful
ambassador
is
says
thy
wise
servant
solomon
thy
voice
received
in
the
beginning
of
a
sickness
of
a
sin
is
true
health
if
i
can
see
that
light
betimes
and
hear
that
voice
early
shall
my
light
break
forth
as
the
morning
and
my
health
shall
spring
forth
deliver
me
therefore
o
my
god
from
these
vain
imaginations
that
it
is
an
thing
a
dangerous
thing
to
come
to
that
tenderness
that
rawness
that
scrupulousness
to
fear
every
concupiscence
every
offer
of
sin
that
this
suspicious
and
jealous
diligence
will
turn
to
an
inordinate
dejection
of
spirit
and
a
diffidence
in
thy
care
and
providence
but
keep
me
still
established
both
in
a
constant
assurance
that
thou
wilt
speak
to
me
at
the
beginning
of
every
such
sickness
at
the
approach
of
every
such
sin
and
that
if
i
take
knowledge
of
that
voice
then
and
fly
to
thee
thou
wilt
preserve
me
from
falling
or
raise
me
again

by

infirmity
i
am
fallen

which
go
so
very
many
more
go
not

i

is
insipid

fatuous
instantly
the
appetite
is
dull
and
desireless
instantly
the

are
sinking
and
strengthless
and
in
an
instant
sleep
which
is
the
picture
the
copy
of
death
is
taken
away
that
the
original
death
itself
may
succeed

that
so
i
might
have
death

i
have
it
and
i
sweat
again
and
again
from
the
brow
to
the
sole
of
the
foot
but
i
eat
no

i
taste
no

miserable

david

himself
a

david

no

is
so
little
in

of
the

man
as
the
greatest
in

of
god
for
here
in
that
we
have
not
so
much
as
a
measure
to
try
it
by
proportion
is
no

for

he
that
hath
no
more
of
this

but
a
grave
he
that
hath
his
grave
but
lent
him
till
a
better
man
or
another
man
must
be
buried
in
the
same
grave
he
that
hath
no
grave
but
a
dunghill
he
that
hath
no
more
earth
but
that
which
he
carries
but
that
which
he
is
he
that
hath
not
that
earth
which
he
is
but
even
in
that
is
another
slave
hath
as
much
proportion
to
god
as
if
all
david
worthies
and
all
the
monarchs
and
all
imagination
giants
were
kneaded
and
incorporated
into
one
and
as
though
that
one
were
the
survivor
of
all
the
sons
of
men
to
whom
god
had
given
the
world
and
therefore
how
little
soever
i
be
as
calls
things
that
are
not
as
though
they
i
who
am
as
though
i
were
not
may
call
upon
god
and
say
my
god
my
god
why
comes
thine
anger
so
fast
upon
me
why
dost
thou
melt
me
scatter
me
pour
me
like
water
upon
the
ground
so
instantly
thou
stayedst
for
the
first
world
in
noah
time
one
hundred
and
twenty
years
thou
stayedst
for
a
rebellious
generation
in
the
wilderness
forty
years
wilt
thou
stay
no
minute
for
me
wilt
thou
make
thy
process
and
thy
decree
thy
citation
and
thy
judgment
but
one
act
thy
summons
thy
battle
thy
victory
thy
triumph
all
but
one
act
and
lead
me
captive
nay
deliver
me
captive
to
death
as
soon
as
thou
declarest
me
to
be
enemy
and
so
cut
me
off
even
with
the
drawing
of
thy
sword
out
of
the
scabbard
and
for
that
question
how
long
was
he
sick
leave
no
other
answer
but
that
the
hand
of
death
pressed
upon
him
from
the
first
minute
my
god
my
god
thou
wast
not
wont
to
come
in
whirlwinds
but
in
soft
and
gentle
air
thy
first
breath
breathed
a
soul
into
me
and
shall
thy
breath
blow
it
out
thy
breath
in
the
congregation
thy
word
in
the
church
breathes
communion
and
consolation
here
and
consummation
hereafter
shall
thy
breath
in
this
chamber
breathe
dissolution
and
destruction
divorce
and
separation
surely
it
is
not
thou
it
is
not
thy
hand
the
devouring
sword
the
consuming
fire
the
winds
from
the
wilderness
the
diseases
of
the
body
all
that
afflicted
job
were
from
the
hands
of
satan
it
is
not
thou
it
is
thou
thou
my
god
who
hast
led
me
so
continually
with
thy
hand
from
the
hand
of
my
nurse
as
that
i
know
thou
wilt
not
correct
me
but
with
thine
own
hand
my
parents
would
not
give
me
over
to
a
servant
correction
nor
my
god
to
satan
i
am
into
the
hands
of
with
david
and
with
david
i
see
that
his
mercies
are
great
for
by
that
mercy
i
consider
in
my
present
state
not
the
haste
and
the
despatch
of
the
disease
in
dissolving
this
body
so
much
as
the
much
more
haste
and
despatch
which
my
god
shall
use
in
and
this
dust
again
at
the
resurrection
then
i
shall
hear
his
angels
proclaim
the
rise
ye
dead
though
i
be
dead
i
shall
hear
the
voice
the
sounding
of
the
voice
and
the
working
of
the
voice
shall
be
all
one
and
all
shall
rise
there
in
a
less
minute
than
any
one
dies
here
ii
prayer
o
most
gracious
god
who
pursuest
and
perfectest
thine
own
purposes
and
dost
not
only
remember
me
by
the
first
accesses
of
this
sickness
that
i
must
die
but
inform
me
by
this
further
proceeding
therein
that
i
may
die
now
who
hast
not
only
waked
me
with
the
first
but
called
me
up
by
casting
me
further
down
and
clothed
me
with
thyself
by
stripping
me
of
my
self
and
by
dulling
my
bodily
senses
to
the
meats
and
eases
of
this
world
hast
whet
and
sharpened
my
spiritual
senses
to
the
apprehension
of
thee
by
what
steps
and
degrees
soever
it
shall
please
thee
to
go
in
the
dissolution
of
this
body
hasten
o
lord
that
pace
and
multiply
o
my
god
those
degrees
in
the
exaltation
of
my
soul
toward
thee
now
and
to
thee
then
my
taste
is
not
gone
away
but
gone
up
to
sit
at
david
table
taste
and
see
that
the
lord
is
my
stomach
is
not
gone
but
gone
up
so
far
upwards
toward
the
of
the
with
thy
saints
in
heaven
as
to
the
table
to
the
communion
of
thy
saints
here
in
earth
my
knees
are
weak
but
weak
therefore
that
i
should
easily
fall
to
and
fix
myself
long
upon
my
devotions
to
thee
sound
heart
is
the
life
of
the
and
a
heart
visited
by
thee
and
directed
to
thee
by
that
visitation
is
a
sound
heart
is
no
soundness
in
my
flesh
because
of
thine
interpret
thine
own
work
and
call
this
sickness
correction
and
not
anger
and
there
is
soundness
in
my
flesh
is
no
rest
in
my
bones
because
of
my
transfer
my
sins
with
which
thou
art
so
displeased
upon
him
with
whom
thou
art
so
well
pleased
christ

there
will
be

madest

thorns
of
a
sharp
sickness
appear
unto
me

that
i
may
see
thee

know
thee
to

my
god
applying
thyself
to
me
even
in
these
sharp
and
thorny
passages
do
this
o
lord
for
his
sake
who
was
not

we
attribute

one
privilege

advantage
to
man
body
above
other

creatures
that
he

not

grovelling

of
an
erect
of
an
upright

naturally
built

disposed
to
the

indeed
it
is
a
thankful
form

recompenses
that
soul
which
gives
it
with
carrying
that
soul
so
many

higher
towards

other

look
to
the

and
even
that
is
no
unfit
object
no

for

for
thither

because
man
is
not

there

a

him

i
am

dost
thou
not

my

when
thou

is
not
this

hang
a

at

to
lay
him
sick
in
his

of
wantonness
when
thou
chidest
us
by

thou

great
tribulation
how
shall
they
come

thou

his

the

she
could

my
friends
may
carry
me
home
to
thee
in
their
prayers
in
the
congregation
thou
must
come
home
to
me
in
the
visitation
of
thy
spirit
and
in
the
seal
of
thy
sacrament

when
i
am
cast
into

bed
my
slack
sinews
are
iron
fetters
and
those
thin
sheets
iron
doors
upon
me
and
i
have
loved
the
habitation
of
thine
house
and
the
place
where
thine
honour
i
lie
here
and
say
are
they
that
dwell
in
thy
but
i
can
not
say
will
come
into
thy
i
may
say
thy
fear
will
i
worship
towards
thy
holy
but
i
can
not
say
in
thy
holy
temple
and
the
zeal
of
thy
house
eats
me
as
fast
as
my
fever
it
is
not
a
recusancy
for
i
would
come
but
it
is
an
excommunication
i
must
not
but
lord
thou
art
lord
of
hosts
and
lovest
action
why
callest
thou
me
from
my
calling
the
grave
no
man
shall
praise
in
the
door
of
the
grave
this
sick
bed
no
man
shall
hear
me
praise
thee
thou
hast
not
opened
my
lips
that
my
mouth
might
show
thee
thy
praise
but
that
my
mouth
might
show
forth
thy
praise
but
thine
apostle
fear
takes
hold
of
me
when
i
have
preached
to
others
i
myself
should
be
a
and
therefore
am
i
cast
down
that
i
might
not
be
cast
away
thou
couldst
take
me
by
the
head
as
thou
didst
habbakuk
and
carry
me
so
by
a
chariot
as
thou
didst
elijah
and
carry
me
so
but
thou
carriest
me
thine
own
private
way
the
way
by
which
thou
carriedst
thy
son
who
first
lay
upon
the
earth
and
prayed
and
then
had
his
exaltation
as
himself
calls
his
crucifying
and
first
descended
into
hell
and
then
had
his
ascension
there
is
another
station
indeed
neither
are
stations
but
prostrations
lower
than
this
bed
i
may
be
laid
one
story
lower
upon
the
floor
the
face
of
the
earth
and
next
day
another
story
in
the
grave
the
womb
of
the
earth
as
yet
god
suspends
me
between
heaven
and
earth
as
a
meteor
and
i
am
not
in
heaven
because
an
earthly
body
clogs
me
and
i
am
not
in
the
earth
because
a
heavenly
soul
sustains
me
and
it
is
thine
own
law
o
god
that
a
man
be
smitten
so
by
another
as
that
he
keep
his
bed
though
he
die
not
he
that
hurt
him
must
take
care
of
his
healing
and
recompense
thy
hand
strikes
me
into
this
bed
and
therefore
if
i
rise
again
thou
wilt
be
my
recompense
all
the
days
of
my
life
in
making
the
memory
of
this
sickness
beneficial
to
me
and
if
my
body
fall
yet
lower
thou
wilt
take
my
soul
out
of
this
bath
and
present
it
to
thy
father
washed
again
and
again
and
again
in
thine
own
tears
in
thine
own
sweat
in
thine
own
blood
iii
prayer
o
most
mighty
and
most
merciful
god
who
though
thou
have
taken
me
off
of
my
feet
hast
not
taken
me
off
of
my
foundation
which
is
thyself
who
though
thou
have
removed
me
from
that
upright
form
in
which
i
could
stand
and
see
thy
throne
the
heavens
yet
hast
not
removed
from
me
that
light
by
which
i
can
lie
and
see
thyself
who
though
thou
have
weakened
my
bodily
knees
that
they
can
not
bow
to
thee
hast
yet
left
me
the
knees
of
my
heart
which
are
bowed
unto
thee
evermore
as
thou
hast
made
this
bed
thine
altar
make
me
thy

me
his

in

to

pleasure
by

unto
thee
o

my

i
come
unto
thee
so
as
i
can
come
i
come

thee
by
embracing
thy
coming
to

and
in
the
application

thy
servant
david
promise
thou
wilt
make
all
my
bed
in
my
all
my
bed
that
which
way
soever
i
turn
i
may
turn
to
thee
and
as
i
feel
thy
hand
upon
all
my
body
so
i
may
find
it
upon
all
my
bed
and
see
all
my
corrections
and
all
my
refreshings
to
flow
from
one
and
the
same
and
all
from
thy
hand
as
thou
hast
made
these
feathers
thorns
in
the
sharpness
of
this
sickness
so
lord
make
these
thorns
feathers
again
feathers
of
thy
dove
in
the
peace
of
conscience
and
in
a
holy
recourse
to
thine
ark
to
the
instruments
of
true
comfort
in
thy
institutions
and
in
the
ordinances
of
thy
church
forget
my
bed
o
lord
as
it
hath
been
a
bed
of
sloth
and
worse
than
sloth
take
me
not
o
lord
at
this
advantage
to
terrify
my
soul
with
saying
now
i
have
met
thee
there
where
thou
hast
so
often
departed
from
me
but
having
burnt
up
that
bed
by
these
vehement
heats
and
washed
that
bed
in
these
abundant
sweats
make
my
bed
again
o
lord
and
enable
me
according
to
thy
command
commune
with
mine
own
heart
upon
my
bed
and
be
to
provide
a
bed
for
all
my
former
sins
whilst
i
lie
upon
this
bed
and
a
grave
for
my
sins
before
i
come
to
my
grave
and
when
i
have
deposited
them
in
the
wounds
of
thy
son
to
rest
in
that
assurance
that
my
conscience
is
discharged
from
further
anxiety
and
my
soul
from
further
danger
and
my
memory
from
further
calumny
do
this
o
lord
for
his
sake
who
did
and
suffered
so
much
that
thou
mightest
as
well
in
thy
justice
as
in
thy
mercy
do
it
for
me
thy

iv
meditation
it
is
too
little
to
call
man
a
little
world
except
god
man
is
a
diminutive
to
nothing
man
consists
of
more
pieces
more
parts
than
the
world
than
the
world
doth
nay
than
the
world
is
and
if
those
pieces
were
extended
and
stretched
out
in
man
as
they
are
in
the
world
man
would
be
the
giant
and
the
world
the
dwarf
the
world
but
the
map
and
the
man
the
world
if
all
the
veins
in
our
bodies
were
extended
to
rivers
and
all
the
sinews
to
veins
of
mines
and
all
the
muscles
that
lie
upon
one
another
to
hills
and
all
the
bones
to
quarries
of
stones
and
all
the
other
pieces
to
the
proportion
of
those
which
correspond
to
them
in
the
world
the
air
would
be
too
little
for
this
orb
of
man
to
move
in
the
firmament
would
be
but
enough
for
this
star
for
as
the
whole
world
hath
nothing
to
which
something
in
man
doth
not
answer
so
hath
man
many
pieces
of
which
the
whole
world
hath
no
representation
enlarge
this
meditation
upon
this
great
world
man
so
far
as
to
consider
the
immensity
of
the
creatures
this
world
produces
our
creatures
are
our
thoughts
creatures
that
are
born
giants
that
reach
from
east
to
west
from
earth
to
heaven
that
do
not
only
bestride
all
the
sea
and
land
but
span
the
sun
and
firmament
at
once
my
thoughts
reach
all
comprehend
all
inexplicable
mystery
i
their
creator
am
in
a
close
prison
in
a
sick
bed
any
where
and
any
one
of
my
creatures
my
thoughts
is
with
the
sun
and
beyond
the
sun
overtakes
the
sun
and
overgoes
the
sun
in
one
pace
one
step
everywhere
and
then
as
the
other
world
produces
serpents
and
vipers
malignant
and
venomous
creatures
and
worms
and
caterpillars
that
endeavour
to
devour
that
world
which
produces
them
and
monsters
compiled
and
complicated
of
divers
parents
and
kinds
so
this
world
ourselves
produces
all
these
in
us
in
producing
diseases
and
sicknesses
of
all
those
sorts
venomous
and
infectious
diseases
feeding
and
consuming
diseases
and
manifold
and
entangled
diseases
made
up
of
many
several
ones
and
can
the
other
world
name
so
many
venomous
so
many
consuming
so
many
monstrous
creatures
as
we
can
diseases
of
all
these
kinds
o
miserable
abundance
o
beggarly
riches
how
much
do
we
lack
of
having
remedies
for
every
disease
when
as
yet
we
have
not
names
for
them
but
we
have
a
hercules
against
these
giants
these
monsters
that
is
the
physician
he
musters
up
all
the
forces
of
the
other
world
to
succour
this
all
nature
to
relieve
man
we
have
the
physician
but
we
are
not
the
physician
here
we
shrink
in
our
proportion
sink
in
our
dignity
in
respect
of
very
mean
creatures
who
are
physicians
to
themselves
the
hart
that
is
pursued
and
wounded
they
say
knows
an
herb
which
being
eaten
throws
off
the
arrow
a
strange
kind
of
vomit
the
dog
that
pursues
it
though
he
be
subject
to
sickness
even
proverbially
knows
his
grass
that
recovers
him
and
it
may
be
true
that
the
drugger
is
as
near
to
man
as
to
other
creatures
it
may
be
that
obvious
and
present
simples
easy
to
be
had
would
cure
him
but
the
apothecary
is
not
so
near
him
nor
the
physician
so
near
him
as
they
two
are
to
other
creatures
man
hath
not
that
innate
instinct
to
apply
those
natural
medicines
to
his
present
danger
as
those
inferior
creatures
have
he
is
not
his
own
apothecary
his
own
physician
as
they
are
call
back
therefore
thy
meditation
again
and
bring
it
down
what
become
of
man
great
extent
and
proportion
when
himself
shrinks
himself
and
consumes
himself
to
a
handful
of
dust
what
become
of
his
soaring
thoughts
his
compassing
thoughts
when
himself
brings
himself
to
the
ignorance
to
the
thoughtlessness
of
the
grave
his
diseases
are
his
own
but
the
physician
is
not
he
hath
them
at
home
but
he
must
send
for
the
physician
iv
expostulation
i
have
not
the
righteousness
of
job
but
i
have
the
desire
of
job
would
speak
to
the
almighty
and
i
would
reason
with
my
god
my
god
how
soon
wouldst
thou
have
me
go
to
the
physician
and
how
far
wouldst
thou
have
me
go
with
the
physician
i
know
thou
hast
made
the
matter
and
the
man
and
the
art
and
i
go
not
from
thee
when
i
go
to
the
physician
thou
didst
not
make
clothes
before
there
was
a
shame
of
the
nakedness
of
the
body
but
thou
didst
make
physic
before
there
was
any
grudging
of
any
sickness
for
thou
didst
imprint
a
medicinal
virtue
in
many
simples
even
from
the
beginning
didst
thou
mean
that
we
should
be
sick
when
thou
didst
so
when
thou
madest
them
no
more
than
thou
didst
mean
that
we
should
sin
when
thou
madest
us
thou
foresawest
both
but
causedst
neither
thou
lord
promisest
here
trees
fruit
shall
be
for
meat
and
their
leaves
for
it
is
the
voice
of
thy
son
thou
be
made
whole
that
draws
from
the
patient
a
confession
that
he
was
ill
and
could
not
make
himself
well
and
it
is
thine
own
voice
there
no
physician
that
inclines
us
disposes
us
to
accept
thine
ordinance
and
it
is
the
voice
of
the
wise
man
both
for
the
matter
physic
itself
lord
hath
created
medicines
out
of
the
earth
and
he
that
is
wise
shall
not
abhor
and
for
the
art
and
the
person
the
physician
cutteth
off
a
long
disease
in
all
these
voices
thou
sendest
us
to
those
helps
which
thou
hast
afforded
us
in
that
but
wilt
not
thou
avow
that
voice
too
that
hath
sinned
against
his
maker
let
him
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
and
wilt
not
thou
afford
me
an
understanding
of
those
words
thou
who
sendest
us
for
a
blessing
to
the
physician
dost
not
make
it
a
curse
to
us
to
go
when
thou
sendest
is
not
the
curse
rather
in
this
that
only
he
falls
into
the
hands
of
the
physician
that
casts
himself
wholly
entirely
upon
the
physician
confides
in
him
relies
upon
him
attends
all
from
him
and
neglects
that
spiritual
physic
which
thou
also
hast
instituted
in
thy
church
so
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
physician
is
a
sin
and
a
punishment
of
former
sins
so
as
asa
fell
who
in
his
disease
not
to
the
lord
but
to
the
reveal
therefore
to
me
thy
method
o
lord
and
see
whether
i
have
followed
it
that
thou
mayest
have
glory
if
i
have
and
i
pardon
if
i
have
not
and
help
that
i
may
thy
method
is
time
of
thy
sickness
be
not
wherein
wilt
thou
have
my
diligence
expressed
unto
the
lord
and
he
will
make
thee
o
lord
i
do
i
pray
and
pray
thy
servant
david
prayer
mercy
upon
me
o
lord
for
i
am
weak
heal
me
o
lord
for
my
bones
are
i
know
that
even
my
weakness
is
a
reason
a
motive
to
induce
thy
mercy
and
my
sickness
an
occasion
of
thy
sending
health
when
art
thou
so
ready
when
is
it
so
seasonable
to
thee
to
commiserate
as
in
misery
but
is
prayer
for
health
in
season
as
soon
as
i
am
sick
thy
method
goes
further
off
from
sin
and
order
thy
hands
aright
and
cleanse
thy
heart
from
all
have
i
o
lord
done
so
o
lord
i
have
by
thy
grace
i
am
come
to
a
holy
detestation
of
my
former
sin
is
there
any
more
in
thy
method
there
is
more
a
sweet
savour
and
a
memorial
of
fine
flour
and
make
a
fat
offering
as
not
and
lord
by
thy
grace
i
have
done
that
sacrificed
a
little
of
that
little
which
thou
lentest
me
to
them
for
whom
thou
lentest
it
and
now
in
thy
method
and
by
thy
steps
i
am
come
to
that
give
place
to
the
physician
for
the
lord
hath
created
him
let
him
not
go
from
thee
for
thou
hast
need
of
i
send
for
the
physician
but
i
will
hear
him
enter
with
those
words
of
peter
christ
maketh
thee
i
long
for
his
presence
but
i
look
the
power
of
the
lord
should
be
present
to
heal
iv
prayer
o
most
mighty
and
most
merciful
god
who
art
so
the
god
of
health
and
strength
as
that
without
thee
all
health
is
but
the
fuel
and
all
strength
but
the
bellows
of
sin
behold
me
under
the
vehemence
of
two
diseases
and
under
the
necessity
of
two
physicians
authorized
by
thee
the
bodily
and
the
spiritual
physician
i
come
to
both
as
to
thine
ordinance
and
bless
and
glorify
thy
name
that
in
both
cases
thou
hast
afforded
help
to
man
by
the
ministry
of
man
even
in
the
new
jerusalem
in
heaven
itself
it
hath
pleased
thee
to
discover
a
tree
which
is
tree
of
life
there
but
the
leaves
thereof
are
for
the
healing
of
the
life
itself
is
with
thee
there
for
thou
art
life
and
all
kinds
of
health
wrought
upon
us
here
by
thine
instruments
descend
from
thence
wouldst
have
healed
babylon
but
she
is
not
take
from
me
o
lord
her
perverseness
her
wilfulness
her
refractoriness
and
hear
thy
spirit
saying
in
my
soul
heal
me
o
lord
for
i
would
be
healed
saw
his
sickness
and
judah
his
wound
then
went
ephraim
to
the
assyrian
and
sent
to
king
jareb
yet
could
not
he
heal
you
nor
cure
you
of
your
keep
me
back
o
lord
from
them
who
misprofess
arts
of
healing
the
soul
or
of
the
body
by
means
not
imprinted
by
thee
in
the
church
for
the
soul
or
not
in
nature
for
the
body
there
is
no
spiritual
health
to
be
had
by
superstition
nor
bodily
by
witchcraft
thou
lord
and
only
thou
art
lord
of
both
thou
in
thyself
art
lord
of
both
and
thou
in
thy
son
art
the
physician
the
applier
of
both
his
stripes
we
are
says
the
prophet
there
there
before
he
was
scourged
we
were
healed
with
his
stripes
how
much
more
shall
i
be
healed
now
now
when
that
which
he
hath
already
suffered
actually
is
actually
and
effectually
applied
to
me
is
there
any
thing
incurable
upon
which
that
balm
drops
any
vein
so
empty
as
that
that
blood
can
not
fill
it
thou
promisest
to
heal
the
earth
but
it
is
when
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
that
thou
wouldst
heal
thou
promisest
to
heal
their
waters
but
miry
places
and
standing
thou
sayest
there
wilt
not
my
returning
to
any
sin
if
i
should
return
to
the
ability
of
sinning
over
all
my
sins
again
thou
wouldst
not
pardon
heal
this
earth
o
my
god
by
repentant
tears
and
heal
these
waters
these
tears
from
all
bitterness
from
all
diffidence
from
all
dejection
by
establishing
my
irremovable
assurance
in
thee
son
went
about
healing
all
manner
of
no
disease
incurable
none
difficult
he
healed
them
in
passing
went
out
of
him
and
he
healed
all
the
multitude
no
person
incurable
he
healed
them
as
himself
speaks
he
left
no
relics
of
the
disease
and
will
this
universal
physician
pass
by
this
hospital
and
not
visit
me
not
heal
me
not
heal
me
wholly
lord
i
look
not
that
thou
shouldst
say
by
thy
messenger
to
me
as
to
hezekiah
i
will
heal
thee
and
on
the
third
day
thou
shalt
go
up
to
the
house
of
the

say
to
me

moses
in
miriam
behalf
when
moses
would
have
had
her
healed
presently
her
father
had
but
spit
in

should
she
not

ashamed
seven
days
let
her
be
shut
up
seven
days

then
but
if
thou
be
pleased
to
multiply
seven
days
and
seven
is
infinite
by
the
number
of
my
sins
and
that
is
more
infinite
if
this
day
must
remove
me
till
days
shall
be
no

me
the

my
temporal
health

shall
assist
in
this

in
that

in
that

as
may
most

thee

meditation
as
sickness
is
the
greatest
misery
so
the
greatest
misery
of
sickness
is
solitude
when
the
infectiousness
of
the
disease
deters
them
who
should
assist
from
coming
even
the
physician
dares
scarce
come
solitude
is
a
torment
which
is
not
threatened
in
hell
itself
mere
vacuity
the
first
agent
god
the
first
instrument
of
god
nature
will
not
admit
nothing
can
be
utterly
empty
but
so
near
a
degree
towards
vacuity
as
solitude
to
be
but
one
they
love
not
when
i
am
dead
and
my
body
might
infect
they
have
a
remedy
they
may
bury
me
but
when
i
am
but
sick
and
might
infect
they
have
no
remedy
but
their
absence
and
my
solitude
it
is
an
excuse
to
them
that
are
great
and
pretend
and
yet
are
loath
to
come
it
is
an
inhibition
to
those
who
would
truly
come
because
they
may
be
made
instruments
and
pestiducts
to
the
infection
of
others
by
their
coming
and
it
is
an
outlawry
an
excommunication
upon
the
patient
and
separates
him
from
all
offices
not
only
of
civility
but
of
working
charity
a
long
sickness
will
weary
friends
at
last
but
a
pestilential
sickness
averts
them
from
the
beginning
god
himself
would
admit
a
figure
of
society
as
there
is
a
plurality
of
persons
in
god
though
there
be
but
one
god
and
all
his
external
actions
testify
a
love
of
society
and
communion
in
heaven
there
are
orders
of
angels
and
armies
of
martyrs
and
in
that
house
many
mansions
in
earth
families
cities
churches
colleges
all
plural
things
and
lest
either
of
these
should
not
be
company
enough
alone
there
is
an
association
of
both
a
communion
of
saints
which
makes
the
militant
and
triumphant
church
one
parish
so
that
christ
was
not
out
of
his
diocess
when
he
was
upon
the
earth
nor
out
of
his
temple
when
he
was
in
our
flesh
god
who
saw
that
all
that
he
made
was
good
came
not
so
near
seeing
a
defect
in
any
of
his
works
as
when
he
saw
that
it
was
not
good
for
man
to
be
alone
therefore
he
made
him
a
helper
and
one
that
should
help
him
so
as
to
increase
the
number
and
give
him
her
own
and
more
society
angels
who
do
not
propagate
nor
multiply
were
made
at
first
in
an
abundant
number
and
so
were
stars
but
for
the
things
of
this
world
their
blessing
was
increase
for
i
think
i
need
not
ask
leave
to
think
that
there
is
no
phoenix
nothing
singular
nothing
alone
men
that
inhere
upon
nature
only
are
so
far
from
thinking
that
there
is
any
thing
singular
in
this
world
as
that
they
will
scarce
think
that
this
world
itself
is
singular
but
that
every
planet
and
every
star
is
another
world
like
this
they
find
reason
to
conceive
not
only
a
plurality
in
every
species
in
the
world
but
a
plurality
of
worlds
so
that
the
abhorrers
of
solitude
are
not
solitary
for
god
and
nature
and
reason
concur
against
it
now
a
man
may
counterfeit
the
plague
in
a
vow
and
mistake
a
disease
for
religion
by
such
a
retiring
and
recluding
of
himself
from
all
men
as
to
do
good
to
no
man
to
converse
with
no
man
god
hath
two
testaments
two
wills
but
this
is
a
schedule
and
not
of
his
a
codicil
and
not
of
his
not
in
the
body
of
his
testaments
but
interlined
and
postscribed
by
others
that
the
way
to
the
communion
of
saints
should
be
by
such
a
solitude
as
excludes
all
doing
of
good
here
that
is
a
disease
of
the
mind
as
the
height
of
an
infectious
disease
of
the
body
is
solitude
to
be
left
alone
for
this
makes
an
infectious
bed
equal
nay
worse
than
a
grave
that
though
in
both
i
be
equally
alone
in
my
bed
i
know
it
and
feel
it
and
shall
not
in
my
grave
and
this
too
that
in
my
bed
my
soul
is
still
in
an
infectious
body
and
shall
not
in
my
grave
be
so
expostulation
o
god
my
god
thy
son
took
it
not
ill
at
martha
hands
that
when
he
said
unto
her
brother
lazarus
shall
rise
she
expostulated
it
so
far
with
him
as
to
reply
know
that
he
shall
rise
again
in
the
resurrection
at
the
last
for
she
was
miserable
by
wanting
him
then
take
it
not
ill
o
my
god
from
me
that
though
thou
have
ordained
it
for
a
blessing
and
for
a
dignity
to
thy
people
they
should
dwell
alone
and
not
be
reckoned
among
the
because
they
should
be
above
them
and
that
should
dwell
in
safety
free
from
the
infestation
of
enemies
yet
i
take
thy
leave
to
remember
thee
that
thou
hast
said
too
are
better
than
and
be
unto
him
that
is
alone
when
he
and
so
when
he
is
fallen
and
laid
in
the
bed
of
sickness
too
is
i
know
thy
wisdom
hath
said
so
but
no
man
though
covered
with
the
righteousness
of
thy
son
is
immortal
so
as
not
to
die
for
he
who
was
righteousness
itself
did
die
i
know
that
the
son
of
righteousness
thy
son
refused
not
nay
affected
solitariness
loneness
many
many
times
but
at
all
times
he
was
able
to
command
than
twelve
legions
of
to
his
service
and
when
he
did
not
so
he
was
far
from
being
alone
for
am
not
says
he
i
and
the
father
that
sent
i
can
not
fear
but
that
i
shall
always
be
with
thee
and
him
but
whether
this
disease
may
not
alien
and
remove
my
friends
so
that
stand
aloof
from
my
sore
and
my
kinsmen
stand
afar
i
can
not
tell
i
can
not
fear
but
that
thou
wilt
reckon
with
me
from
this
minute
in
which
by
thy
grace
i
see
thee
whether
this
understanding
and
this
will
and
this
memory
may
not
decay
to
the
discouragement
and
the
ill
interpretation
of
them
that
see
that
heavy
change
in
me
i
can
not
tell
it
was
for
thy
blessed
thy
powerful
son
alone
tread
the
alone
and
none
of
the
people
with
i
am
not
able
to
pass
this
agony
alone
not
alone
without
thee
thou
art
thy
spirit
not
alone
without
thine
spiritual
and
temporal
physicians
are
thine
not
alone
without
mine
those
whom
the
bands
of
blood
or
friendship
have
made
mine
are
mine
and
if
thou
or
thine
or
mine
abandon
me
i
am
alone
and
woe
unto
me
if
i
be
alone
elias
himself
fainted
under
that
apprehension
i
am
left
and
martha
murmured
at
that
said
to
christ
dost
not
thou
care
that
my
sister
hath
left
me
to
serve
alone
neither
could
jeremiah
enter
into
his
lamentations
from
a
higher
ground
than
to
say
doth
the
city
sit
solitary
that
was
full
of
o
my
god
it
is
the
leper
that
thou
hast
condemned
to
live
alone
have
i
such
a
leprosy
in
my
soul
that
i
must
die
alone
alone
without
thee
shall
this
come
to
such
a
leprosy
in
my
body
that
i
must
die
alone
alone
without
them
that
should
assist
that
should
comfort
me
but
comes
not
this
expostulation
too
near
a
murmuring
must
i
be
concluded
with
that
that
moses
commanded
to
come
near
the
lord
that
solitariness
and
dereliction
and
abandoning
of
others
disposes
us
best
for
god
who
accompanies
us
most
alone
may
i
not
remember
and
apply
too
that
though
god
came
not
to
jacob
till
he
found
him
alone
yet
when
he
found
him
alone
he
wrestled
with
him
and
lamed
him
that
when
in
the
dereliction
and
forsaking
of
friends
and
physicians
a
man
is
left
alone
to
god
god
may
so
wrestle
with
this
jacob
with
this
conscience
as
to
put
it
out
of
joint
and
so
appear
to
him
as
that
he
dares
not
look
upon
him
face
to
face
when
as
by
way
of
reflection
in
the
consolation
of
his
temporal
or
spiritual
servants
and
ordinances
he
durst
if
they
were
there
but
a
friend
is
the
physic
of
life
and
they
that
fear
the
lord
shall
find
therefore
hath
the
lord
afforded
me
both
in
one
person
that
physician
who
is
my
faithful
friend
prayer
o
eternal
and
most
gracious
god
who
calledst
down
fire
from
heaven
upon
the
sinful
cities
but
once
and
openedst
the
earth
to
swallow
the
murmurers
but
once
and
threwest
down
the
tower
of
siloam
upon
sinners
but
once
but
for
thy
works
of
mercy
repeatedst
them
often
and
still
workest
by
thine
own
patterns
as
thou
broughtest
man
into
this
world
by
giving
him
a
helper
fit
for
him
here
so
whether
it
be
thy
will
to
continue
me
long
thus
or
to
dismiss
me
by
death
be
pleased
to
afford
me
the
helps
fit
for
both
conditions
either
for
my
weak
stay
here
or
my
final
transmigration
from
hence
and
if
thou
mayst
receive
glory
by
that
way
and
by
all
ways
thou
mayst
receive
glory
glorify
thyself
in
preserving
this
body
from
such
infections
as
might
withhold
those
who
would
come
or
endanger
them
who
do
come
and
preserve
this
soul
in
the
faculties
thereof
from
all
such
distempers
as
might
shake
the
assurance
which
myself
and
others
have
had
that
because
thou
hast
loved
me
thou
wouldst
love
me
to
my
end
and
at
my
end
open
none
of
my
doors
not
of
my
heart
not
of
mine
ears
not
of
my
house
to
any
supplanter
that
would
enter
to
undermine
me
in
my
religion
to
thee
in
the
time
of
my
weakness
or
to
defame
me
and
magnify
himself
with
false
rumours
of
such
a
victory
and
surprisal
of
me
after
i
am
dead
be
my
salvation
and
plead
my
salvation
work
it
and
declare
it
and
as
thy
triumphant
shall
be
so
let
the
militant
church
be
assured
that
thou
wast
my
god
and
i
thy
servant
to
and
in
my
consummation
bless
thou
the
learning
and
the
labours
of
this
man
whom
thou
sendest
to
assist
me
and
since
thou
takest
me
by
the
hand
and
puttest
me
into
his
hands
for
i
come
to
him
in
thy
name
who
in
thy
name
comes
to
me
since
i
clog
not
my
hopes
in
him
no
nor
my
prayers
to
thee
with
any
limited
conditions
but
inwrap
all
in
those
two
petitions
kingdom
come
thy
will
be
prosper
him
and

me
in
thy
way
in
thy

the

with

the

i

he

and
i
fear
with

i

i

in

i

because

and
i

it
with

because

would
not

it
he

that
his

shall
not

the

of

he
knows
that
my

may
disorder
the
effect

of
his
practice
as
the
ill
affections
of
the
spleen
complicate
and
mingle
themselves
with
every
infirmity
of

so

insinuate
itself
in

of

and
as
wind
in

will
counterfeit
any

so
fear
will
counterfeit
any
disease
of

it
shall
seem
love
a
love
of
having
and
it
is
but
a
fear
a
jealous
and
suspicious
fear
of
losing
it
shall
seem
valour
in
despising
and
undervaluing
danger
and
it
is
but
fear
in
an
overvaluing
of
opinion
and
estimation
and
a
fear
of
losing
that
a
man
that
is
not
afraid
of
a
lion
is
afraid
of
a
cat
not
afraid
of
starving
and
yet
is
afraid
of
some
joint
of
meat
at
the
table
presented
to
feed
him
not
afraid
of
the
sound
of
drums
and
trumpets
and
shot
and
those
which
they
seek
to
drown
the
last
cries
of
men

is
afraid
of
some
particular
harmonious
instrument
so
much
afraid
as
that
with
any
of
these
the
enemy
might
drive
this
man
otherwise

out

should
belie

if
i

i

belie
god
my
weakness
is
from
nature
who
hath
but
her
measure
my
strength
is
from
god
who
possesses
and
distributes
infinitely
as
then
every
cold
air
is
not

every

every

as
my

fear
puts

vi
expostulation
my
god
my
god
i
find
in
thy
book
that
fear
is
a
stifling
spirit
a
spirit
of
suffocation
that
could
not
speak
nor
reply
in
his
own
defence
to
abner
because
he
was
it
was
thy
servant
job
case
too
who
before
he
could
say
anything
to
thee
says
of
thee
him
take
his
rod
away
from
me
and
let
not
his
fear
terrify
me
then
would
i
speak
with
him
and
not
fear
him
but
it
is
not
so
with
shall
a
fear
of
thee
take
away
my
devotion
to
thee
dost
thou
command
me
to
speak
to
thee
and
command
me
to
fear
thee
and
do
these
destroy
one
another
there
is
no
perplexity
in
thee
my
god
no
inextricableness
in
thee
my
light
and
my
clearness
my
sun
and
my
moon
that
directest
me
as
well
in
the
night
of
adversity
and
fear
as
in
my
day
of
prosperity
and
confidence
i
must
then
speak
to
thee
at
all
times
but
when
must
i
fear
thee
at
all
times
too
when
didst
thou
rebuke
any
petitioner
with
the
name
of
importunate
thou
hast
proposed
to
us
a
parable
of
a
judge
that
did
justice
at
last
because
the
client
was
importunate
and
troubled
him
but
thou
hast
told
us
plainly
that
thy
use
in
that
parable
was
not
that
thou
wast
troubled
with
our
importunities
but
as
thou
sayest
there
we
should
always
and
to
the
same
purpose
thou
proposest
another
that
if
i
press
my
friend
when
he
is
in
bed
at
midnight
to
lend
me
bread
though
he
will
not
rise
because
i
am
his
friend
yet
because
of
mine
importunity
he
will
god
will
do
this
whensoever
thou
askest
and
never
call
it
importunity
pray
in
thy
bed
at
midnight
and
god
will
not
say
i
will
hear
thee
upon
thy
knees
at
thy
bedside
pray
upon
thy
knees
there
then
and
god
will
not
say
i
will
hear
thee
on
sunday
at
church
god
is
no
dilatory
god
no
froward
god
prayer
is
never
unseasonable
god
is
never
asleep
nor
absent
but
o
my
god
can
i
do
this
and
fear
thee
come
to
thee
and
speak
to
thee
in
all
places
at
all
hours
and
fear
thee
dare
i
ask
this
question
there
is
more
boldness
in
the
question
than
in
the
coming
i
may
do
it
though
i
fear
thee
i
can
not
do
it
except
i
fear
thee
so
well
hast
thou
provided
that
we
should
always
fear
thee
as
that
thou
hast
provided
that
we
should
fear
no
person
but
thee
nothing
but
thee
no
men
no
whom
lord
is
my
help
and
my
salvation
whom
shall
i
fear
great
enemies
not
great
enemies
for
no
enemies
are
great
to
them
that
fear
thee
not
the
people
of
this
land
for
they
are
bread
to
they
shall
not
only
not
eat
us
not
eat
our
bread
but
they
shall
be
our
bread
why
should
we
fear
them
but
for
all
this
metaphorical
bread
victory
over
enemies
that
thought
to
devour
us
may
we
not
fear
that
we
may
lack
bread
literally
and
fear
famine
though
we
fear
not
enemies
lions
do
lack
and
suffer
hunger
but
they
that
seek
the
lord
shall
not
want
any
good
never
though
it
be
well
with
them
at
one
time
may
they
not
fear
that
it
may
be
worse
should
i
fear
in
the
days
of
evil
says
thy
servant
david
though
his
own
sin
had
made
them
evil
he
feared
them
not
no
not
if
this
evil
determine
in
death
not
though
in
a
death
not
though
in
a
death
inflicted
by
violence
by
malice
by
our
own
desert
not
the
sentence
of
if
thou
fear
god
thou
art
o
my
god
so
far
from
admitting
us
that
fear
thee
to
fear
others
as
that
thou
makest
others
to
fear
us
as
feared
john
because
he
was
a
holy
and
a
just
man
and
observed
how
fully
then
o
my
abundant
god
how
gently
o
my
sweet
my
easy
god
dost
thou
unentangle
me
in
any
scruple
arising
out
of
the
consideration
of
thy
fear
is
not
this
that
which
thou
intendest
when
thou
sayest
secret
of
the
lord
is
with
them
that
fear
the
secret
the
mystery
of
the
right
use
of
fear
dost
thou
not
mean
this
when
thou
sayest
shall
understand
the
fear
of
the
have
it
and
have
benefit
by
it
have
it
and
stand
under
it
be
directed
by
it
and
not
be
dejected
with
it
and
dost
thou
not
propose
that
church
for
our
example
when
thou
sayest
the
church
of
judea
in
the
fear
of
they
had
it
but
did
not
sit
down
lazily
nor
fall
down
weakly
nor
sink
under
it
there
is
a
fear
which
weakens
men
in
the
service
of
god
was
afraid
because
he
was
they
who
have
put
off
thee
are
a
prey
to
all
they
may
fear
for
wilt
laugh
when
their
fear
comes
upon
as
thou
hast
told
them
more
than
once
and
thou
wilt
make
them
fear
where
no
cause
of
fear
is
as
thou
hast
told
them
more
than
once
too
there
is
a
fear
that
is
a
punishment
of
former
wickednesses
and
induces
more
though
some
said
of
thy
son
christ
jesus
he
was
a
good
man
yet
no
man
spake
openly
for
fear
of
the
joseph
was
his
disciple
secretly
for
fear
of
the
the
disciples
kept
some
meetings
but
with
doors
shut
for
fear
of
the
jews
o
my
god
thou
givest
us
fear
for
ballast
to
carry
us
steadily
in
all
weathers
but
thou
wouldst
ballast
us
with
such
sand
as
should
have
gold
in
it
with
that
fear
which
is
thy
fear
for
fear
of
the
lord
is
his
he
that
hath
that
lacks
nothing
that
man
can
have
nothing
that
god
does
give
timorous
men
thou
rebukest
are
ye
fearful
o
ye
of
little
faith
such
thou
dismissest
from
thy
service
with
scorn
though
of
them
there
went
from
gideon
army
thousand
and
remained
but
ten
thousand
such
thou
sendest
farther
than
so
thither
from
whence
they
never
return
fearful
and
the
unbelieving
into
that
burning
lake
which
is
the
second
there
is
a
fear
and
there
is
a
hope
which
are
equal
abominations
to
thee
for
they
were
confounded
because
they
hoped
says
thy
servant
job
because
they
had
misplaced
miscentred
their
hopes
they
hoped
and
not
in
thee
and
such
shall
fear
and
not
fear
thee
but
in
thy
fear
my
god
and
my
fear
my
god
and
my
hope
is
hope
and
love
and
confidence
and
peace
and
every
limb
and
ingredient
of
happiness
enwrapped
for
joy
includes
all
and
fear
and
joy
consist
together
nay
constitute
one
another
women
departed
from
the
the
women
who
were
made
supernumerary
apostles
apostles
to
the
apostles
mothers
of
the
church
and
of
the
fathers
grandfathers
of
the
church
the
apostles
themselves
the
women
angels
of
the
resurrection
went
from
the
sepulchre
with
fear
and
joy
they
ran
says
the
text
and
they
ran
upon
those
two
legs
fear
and
joy
and
both
was
the
right
leg
they
joy
in
thee
o
lord
that
fear
thee
and
fear
thee
only
who
feel
this
joy
in
thee
nay
thy
fear
and
thy
love
are
inseparable
still
we
are
called
upon
in
infinite
places
to
fear
god
yet
the
commandment
which
is
the
root
of
all
is
thou
shalt
love
the
lord
thy
god
he
doeth
neither
that
doeth
not
both
he
omits
neither
that
does
one
therefore
when
thy
servant
david
had
said
that
fear
of
the
lord
is
the
beginning
of
and
his
son
had
repeated
it
again
he
that
collects
both
calls
this
fear
the
root
of
wisdom
and
that
it
may
embrace
all
he
calls
it
wisdom
itself
a
wise
man
therefore
is
never
without
it
never
without
the
exercise
of
it
therefore
thou
sentest
moses
to
thy
people
they
might
learn
to
fear
thee
all
the
days
of
their
not
in
heavy
and
calamitous
but
in
good
and
cheerful
days
too
for
noah
who
had
assurance
of
his
deliverance
yet
with
fear
prepared
an
ark
for
the
saving
of
his
wise
man
will
fear
in
and
therefore
though
i
pretend
to
no
other
degree
of
wisdom
i
am
abundantly
rich
in
this
that
i
lie
here
possessed
with
that
fear
which
is
thy
fear
both
that
this
sickness
is
thy
immediate
correction
and
not
merely
a
natural
accident
and
therefore
fearful
because
it
is
a
fearful
thing
to
fall
into
thy
hands
and
that
this
fear
preserves
me
from
all
inordinate
fear
arising
out
of
the
infirmity
of
nature
because
thy
hand
being
upon
me
thou
wilt
never
let
me
fall
out
of
thy
hand
vi
prayer
o
most
mighty
god
and
merciful
god
the
god
of
all
true
sorrow
and
true
joy
too
of
all
fear
and
of
all
hope
too
as
thou
hast
given
me
a
repentance
not
to
be
repented
of
so
give
me
o
lord
a
fear
of
which
i
may
not
be
afraid
give
me
tender
and
supple
and
conformable
affections
that
as
i
joy
with
them
that
joy
and
mourn
with
them
that
mourn
so
i
may
fear
with
them
that
fear
and
since
thou
hast
vouchsafed
to
discover
to
me
in
his
fear
whom
thou
hast
admitted
to
be
my
assistance
in
this
sickness
that
there
is
danger
therein
let
me
not
o
lord
go
about
to
overcome
the
sense
of
that
fear
so
far
as
to
pretermit
the
fitting
and
preparing
of
myself
for
the
worst
that
may
be
feared
the
passage
out
of
this
life
many
of
thy
blessed
martyrs
have
passed
out
of
this
life
without
any
show
of
fear
but
thy
most
blessed
son
himself
did
not
so
thy
martyrs
were
known
to
be
but
men
and
therefore
it
pleased
thee
to
fill
them
with
thy
spirit
and
thy
power
in
that
they
did
more
than
men
thy
son
was
declared
by
thee
and
by
himself
to
be
god
and
it
was
requisite
that
he
should
declare
himself
to
be
man
also
in
the
weaknesses
of
man
let
me
not
therefore
o
my
god
be
ashamed
of
these
fears
but
let
me
feel
them
to
determine
where
his
fear
did
in
a
present
submitting
of
all
to
thy
will
and
when
thou
shalt
have
inflamed
and
thawed
my
former
coldnesses
and
indevotions
with
these
heats
and
quenched
my
former
heats
with
these
sweats
and
inundations
and
rectified
my
former
presumptions
and
negligences
with
these
fears
be
pleased
o
lord
as
one
made
so
by
thee
to
think
me
fit
for
thee
and
whether
it
be
thy
pleasure
to
dispose
of
this
body
this
garment
so
as
to
put
it
to
a
farther
wearing
in
this
world
or
to
lay
it
up
in
the
common
wardrobe
the
grave
for
the
next
glorify
thyself
in
thy
choice
now
and
glorify
it
then
with
that
glory
which
thy
son
our
saviour
christ
jesus
hath
purchased
for
them
whom
thou
makest
partakers
of
his
resurrection

physician
desires

meditation
there
is
more
fear
therefore
more
cause
if
the
physician
desire
help
the
burden
grows
great
there
is
a
growth
of
the
disease
then
but
there
must
be
an
autumn
too
but
whether
an
autumn
of
the
disease
or
me
it
is
not
my
part
to
choose
but
if
it
be
of
me
it
is
of
both
my
disease
can
not
survive
me
i
may
overlive
it
howsoever
his
desiring
of
others
argues
his
candour
and
his
ingenuity
if
the
danger
be
great
he
justifies
his
proceedings
and
he
disguises
nothing
that
calls
in
witnesses
and
if
the
danger
be
not
great
he
is
not
ambitious
that
is
so
ready
to
divide
the
thanks
and
the
honour
of
that
work
which
he
begun
alone
with
others
it
diminishes
not
the
dignity
of
a
monarch
that
he
derive
part
of
his
care
upon
others
god
hath
not
made
many
suns

he
hath
made

receive
and
give

the
romans
began
with
one
king
they
came
to
two
consuls
they
returned
in
extremities
to
one
dictator
whether
in
one
or
many
the
sovereignty
is
the
same
in
all
states
and
the
danger
is
not
the
more
and
the
providence
is
the
more
where
there
are
more
physicians
as
the
state
is
the
happier
where
businesses
are
carried
by
more
counsels
than
can
be
in
one
breast
how
large
soever
diseases
themselves
hold

and
conspire

may
multiply

and
shall
we
not
call
physicians
to
consultations
death
is
in
an
old
man
door
he
appears

tells
him
so
and
death
is
at
a
young
man
back
and
says
nothing
age
is
a
sickness
and
youth
is
an
ambush
and
we
need
so
many
physicians
as
may
make
up
a
watch
and
spy
every
inconvenience
there
is
scarce
any
thing
that
hath
not
killed
somebody
a
hair
a
feather
hath
done
it
nay
that
which
is
our
best
antidote
against
it
hath
done
it
the
best
cordial
hath
been
deadly
poison
men
have
died
of
joy
and
almost
forbidden
their
friends
to
weep
for
them
when
they
have
seen
them
die
laughing
even
that
tyrant
dionysius
i
think
the
same
that
suffered
so
much
after
who
could
not
die
of
that
sorrow
of
that
high
fall
from
a
king
to
a
wretched
private
man
died
of
so
poor
a
joy
as
to
be
declared
by
the
people
at
a
theatre
that
he
was
a
good
poet
we
say
often
that
a
man
may
live
of
a
little
but
alas
of
how
much
less
may
a
man
die
and
therefore
the
more
assistants
the
better
who
comes
to
a
day
of
hearing
in
a
cause
of
any
importance
with
one
advocate
in
our
funerals
we
ourselves
have
no
interest
there
we
can
not
advise
we
can
not
direct
and
though
some
nations
the
egyptians
in
particular
built
themselves
better
tombs
than
houses
because
they
were
to
dwell
longer
in
them
yet
amongst
ourselves
the
greatest
man
of
style
whom
we
have
had
the
conqueror
was
left
as
soon
as
his
soul
left
him
not
only
without
persons
to
assist
at
his
grave
but
without
a
grave
who
will
keep
us
then
we
know
not
as
long
as
we
can
let
us
admit
as
much
help
as
we
can
another
and
another
physician
is
not
another
and
another
indication
and
symptom
of
death
but
another
and
another
assistant
and
proctor
of
life
nor
do
they
so
much
feed
the
imagination
with
apprehension
of
danger
as
the
understanding
with
comfort
let
not
one
bring
learning
another
diligence
another
religion
but
every
one
bring
all
and
as
many
ingredients
enter
into
a
receipt
so
may
many
men
make
the
receipt
but
why
do
i
exercise
my
meditation
so
long
upon
this
of
having
plentiful
help
in
time
of
need
is
not
my
meditation
rather
to
be
inclined
another
way
to
condole
and
commiserate
their
distress
who
have
none
how
many
are
sicker
perchance
than
i
and
laid
in
their
woful
straw
at
home
if
that
corner
be
a
home

have
no
more
hope
of
help
though
they
die
than
of
preferment
though
they
live
nor
do
more
expect
to
see
a
physician
then

of

them

they

we
shall
never
hear
their
names
till
we

them
in
the
book
of
life
with
our
own
how
many
are
sicker
perchance
than
i

hospitals
where
as
a
fish
left
upon
the
sand
must
stay
the
tide
they
must
stay
the
physician
hour
of
visiting
and
then
can
be

visited

many
are
sicker
perchance
than
all
we
and
have
not
this

to
cover
them
not
this
straw
to
lie
in
to
die
in
but
have
their
gravestone
under
them

breathe
out
their
souls
in
the
ears
and
in
the
eyes
of
passengers
harder
than
their
bed
the
flint
of
the
street
that
taste
of
no
part
of

physic

a
sparing
diet
to
whom
ordinary

would
be
julep
enough
the
refuse
of

bezoar
enough
and
the
offscouring
of

tables
cordial
enough
o
my
soul
when
thou
art
not
enough
awake
to
bless
thy
god
enough
for
his
plentiful
mercy
in
affording
thee
many
helpers
remember
how
many

vii
expostulation
my
god
my
god
thy
blessed
servant
augustine
begged
of
thee
that
moses
might
come
and
tell
him
what
he
meant
by
some
places
of
genesis
may
i
have
leave
to
ask
of
that
spirit
that
writ
that
book
why
when
david
expected
news
from
joab
army
and
that
the
watchman
told
him
that
he
saw
a
man
running
alone
david
concluded
out
of
that
circumstance
that
if
he
came
alone
he
brought
good
news
i
see
the
grammar
the
word
signifies
so
and
is
so
ever
accepted
but
i
see
not
the
logic
nor
the
rhetoric
how
david
would
prove
or
persuade
that
his
news
was
good
because
he
was
alone
except
a
greater
company
might
have
made
great
impressions
of
danger
by
imploring
and
importuning
present
supplies
howsoever
that
be
i
am
sure
that
that
which
thy
apostle
says
to
timothy
luke
is
with
luke
and
nobody
but
luke
hath
a
taste
of
complaint
and
sorrow
in
it
though
luke
want
no
testimony
of
ability
of
forwardness
of
constancy
and
perseverance
in
assisting
that
great
building
which
paul
laboured
in
yet
paul
is
affected
with
that
that
there
was
none
but
luke
to
assist
we
take
luke
to
have
been
a
physician
and
it
admits
the
application
the
better
that
in
the
presence
of
one
good
physician
we
may
be
glad
of
more
it
was
not
only
a
civil
spirit
of
policy
or
order
that
moved
to
persuade
him
to
divide
the
burden
of
government
and
judicature
with
others
and
take
others
to
his
assistance
but
it
was
also
thy
immediate
spirit
o
my
god
that
moved
moses
to
present
unto
thee
seventy
of
the
elders
of
israel
to
receive
of
that
spirit
which
was
upon
moses
only
before
such
a
portion
as
might
ease
him
in
the
government
of
that
people
though
moses
alone
had
endowments
above
all
thou
gavest
him
other
assistants
i
consider
thy
plentiful
goodness
o
my
god
in
employing
angels
more
than
one
in
so
many
of
thy
remarkable
works
of
thy
son
thou
sayest
all
the
angels
of
god
worship
if
that
be
in
heaven
upon
earth
he
says
he
could
command
twelve
legions
of
and
when
heaven
and
earth
shall
be
all
one
at
the
last
day
thy
son
o
god
son
of
man
shall
come
in
his
glory
and
all
the
holy
angels
with
the
angels
that
celebrated
his
birth
to
the
shepherds
the
angels
that
celebrated
his
second
birth
his
resurrection
to
the
maries
were
in
the
plural
angels
associated
with
angels
in
jacob
ladder
they
who
ascended
and
descended
and
maintained
the
trade
between
heaven
and
earth
between
thee
and
us
they
who
have
the
commission
and
charge
to
guide
us
in
all
our
ways
they
who
hastened

and
in
him
us
from
places
of
danger
and
temptation
they
who
are
appointed
to
instruct
and
govern
us
in
the
church
here
they
who
are
sent
to
punish
the
disobedient
and
refractory
that
they
are
to
be
mowers
and
harvestmen
after
we
are
grown
up
in
one
field
the
church
at
the
day
of
judgment
they
that
are
to
carry
our
souls
whither
they
carried
lazarus
they
who
attended
at
the
several
gates
of
the
new
jerusalem
to
admit
us
there
all
these
who
administer
to
thy
servants
from
the
first
to
their
last
are
angels
angels
in
the
plural
in
every
service
angels
associated
with
angels
the
power
of
a
single
angel
we
see
in
that
one
who
in
one
night
destroyed
almost
two
hundred
thousand
in
sennacherib
army
yet
thou
often
employest
many
as
we
know
the
power
of
salvation
is
abundantly
in
any
one
evangelist
and
yet
thou
hast
afforded
us
four
thy
son
proclaims
of
himself
that
spirit
hath
anointed
him
to
preach
the
yet
he
hath
given
others
the
perfecting
of
the
saints
in
the
work
of
the
thou
hast
made
him
of
our
but
there
are
others
bishops
too
he
gave
the
holy
ghost
and
others
gave
it
also
thy
way
o
my
god
and
o
my
god
thou
lovest
to
walk
in
thine
own
ways
for
they
are
large
thy
way
from
the
beginning
is
multiplication
of
thy
helps
and
therefore
it
were
a
degree
of
ingratitude
not
to
accept
this
mercy
of
affording
me
many
helps
for
my
bodily
health
as
a
type
and
earnest
of
thy
gracious
purpose
now
and
ever
to
afford
me
the
same
assistances
that
for
thy
great
help
thy
word
i
may
seek
that
not
from
comers
nor
conventicles
nor
schismatical
singularities
but
from
the
association
and
communion
of
thy
catholic
church
and
those
persons
whom
thou
hast
always
furnished
that
church
withal
and
that
i
may
associate
thy
word
with
thy
sacrament
thy
seal
with
thy
patent
and
in
that
sacrament
associate
the
sign
with
the
thing
signified
the
bread
with
the
body
of
thy
son
so
as
i
may
be
sure
to
have
received
both
and
to
be
made
thereby
as
thy
blessed
servant
augustine
says
the
ark
and
the
monument
and
the
tomb
of
thy
most
blessed
son
that
he
and
all
the
merits
of
his
death
may
by
that
receiving
be
buried
in
me
to
my
quickening
in
this
world
and
my
immortal
establishing
in
the
next
vii
prayer
o
eternal
and
most
gracious
god
who
gavest
to
thy
servants
in
the
wilderness
thy
manna
bread
so
conditioned
qualified
so
as
that
to
every
man
manna
tasted
like
that
which
that
man
liked
best
i
humbly
beseech
thee
to
make
this
correction
which
i
acknowledge
to
be
part
of
my
daily
bread
to
taste
so
to
me
not
as
i
would
but
as
thou
wouldst
have
it
taste
and
to
conform
my
taste
and
make
it
agreeable
to
thy
will
thou
wouldst
have
thy
corrections
taste
of
humiliation
but
thou
wouldst
have
them
taste
of
consolation
too
taste
of
danger
but
taste
of
assurance
too
as
therefore
thou
hast
imprinted
in
all
thine
elements
of
which
our
bodies
consist
two
manifest
qualities
so
that
as
thy
fire
dries
so
it
heats
too
and
as
thy
water
moists
so
it
cools
too
so
o
lord
in
these
corrections
which
are
the
elements
of
our
regeneration
by
which
our
souls
are
made
thine
imprint
thy
two
qualities
those
two
operations
that
as
they
scourge
us
they
may
scourge
us
into
the
way
to
thee
that
when
they
have
showed
us
that
we
are
nothing
in
ourselves
they
may
also
show
us
that
thou
art
all
things
unto
us
when
therefore
in
this
particular
circumstance
o
lord
but
none
of
thy
judgments
are
circumstances
they
are
all
of
all
substance
of
thy
good
purpose
upon
us
when
in
this
particular
that
he
whom
thou
hast
sent
to
assist
me
desires
assistants
to
him
thou
hast
let
me
see
in
how
few
hours
thou
canst
throw
me
beyond
the
help
of
man
let
me
by
the
same
light
see
that
no
vehemence
of
sickness
no
temptation
of
satan
no
guiltiness
of
sin
no
prison
of
death
not
this
first
this
sick
bed
not
the
other
prison
the
close
and
dark
grave
can
remove
me
from
the
determined
and
good
purpose
which
thou
hast
sealed
concerning
me
let
me
think
no
degree
of
this
thy
correction
casual
or
without
signification
but
yet
when
i
have
read
it
in
that
language
as
a
correction
let
me
translate
it
into
another
and
read
it
as
a
mercy
and
which
of
these
is
the
original
and
which
is
the
translation
whether
thy
mercy
or
thy
correction
were
thy
primary
and
original
intention
in
this
sickness
i
can
not
conclude
though
death
conclude
me
for
as
it
must
necessarily
appear
to
be
a
correction
so
i
can
have
no
greater
argument
of
thy
mercy
than
to
die
in
thee
and
by
that
death
to
be
united
to
him
who
died
for
me

that

we
find
new
discoveries
let
him
be
a

and
himself
will
be
the
land
and
misery
the

his
misery
for
misery
is
his
his
own
of
the
happiness
even
of
this

he
is
but
tenant
but
of

the
freeholder
of

he
is
but
the
farmer
but
the
usufructuary
but
of
misery
the
lord
the
proprietary
his
misery
as
the
sea
swells
above
all
the
hills
and
reaches
to
the
remotest
parts
of
this
earth
man
who
of
himself
is
but
dust
and
coagulated
and
kneaded
into
earth
by
tears
his
matter
is
earth
his

misery
in
this
world
that
is
mankind
the
highest
ground
the
eminentest
hills
are
kings
and
have
they
line
and
lead
enough
to
fathom
this
sea
and
say
my
misery
is
but
this
deep
scarce
any
misery
equal
to
sickness
and
they
are
subject
to
that
equally
with
their
lowest
subject
a
glass
is
not
the
less
brittle
because
a
king
face
is
represented
in
it
nor
a
king
the
less
brittle
because
god
is
represented
in
him
they
have
physicians
continually
about
them
and
therefore
sickness
or
the
worst
of
sicknesses
continual
fear
of
it
are
they
gods
he
that
called
them
so
can
not
flatter
they
are
gods
but
sick
gods
and
god
is
presented
to
us
under
many
human
affections
as
far
as
infirmities
god
is
called
angry
and
sorry
and
weary
and
heavy
but
never
a
sick
god
for
then
he
might
die
like
men
as
our
gods
do
the
worst
that
they
could
say
in
reproach
and
scorn
of
the
gods
of
the
heathen
was
that
perchance
they
were
asleep
but
gods
that
are
so
sick
as
that
they
can
not
sleep
are
in
an
infirmer
condition
a
god
and
need
a
physician
a
jupiter
and
need
an
æsculapius
that
must
have
rhubarb
to
purge
his
choler
lest
he
be
too
angry
and
agarick
to
purge
his
phlegm
lest
he
be
too
drowsy
that
as
tertullian
says
of
the
egyptian
gods
plants
and
herbs
that
god
was
beholden
to
man
for
growing
in
his
garden
so
we
must
say
of
these
gods
their
eternity
an
eternity
of
threescore
and
ten
years
is
in
the
apothecary
shop
and
not
in
the
metaphorical
deity
but
their
deity
is
better
expressed
in
their
humility
than
in
their
height
when
abounding
and
overflowing
as
god
in
means
of
doing
good
they
descend
as
god
to
a
communication
of
their
abundances
with
men
according
to
their
necessities
then
they
are
gods
no
man
is
well
that
understands
not
that
values
not
his
being
well
that
hath
not
a
cheerfulness
and
a
joy
in
it
and
whosoever
hath
this
joy
hath
a
desire
to
communicate
to
propagate
that
which
occasions
his
happiness
and
his
joy
to
others
for
every
man
loves
witnesses
of
his
happiness
and
the
best
witnesses
are
experimental
witnesses
they
who
have
tasted
of
that
in
themselves
which
makes
us
happy
it
consummates
therefore
it
perfects
the
happiness
of
kings
to
confer
to
transfer
honour
and
riches
and
as
they
can
health
upon
those
that
need
them
viii
expostulation
my
god
my
god
i
have
a
warning
from
the
wise
man
that
a
rich
man
speaketh
every
man
holdeth
his
tongue
and
look
what
he
saith
they
extol
it
to
the
clouds
but
if
a
poor
man
speak
they
say
what
fellow
is
this
and
if
he
stumble
they
will
help
to
overthrow
therefore
may
my
words
be
undervalued
and
my
errors
aggravated
if
i
offer
to
speak
of
kings
but
not
by
thee
o
my
god
because
i
speak
of
them
as
they
are
in
thee
and
of
thee
as
thou
art
in
them
certainly
those
men
prepare
a
way
of
speaking
negligently
or
irreverently
of
thee
that
give
themselves
that
liberty
in
speaking
of
thy
vicegerents
kings
for
thou
who
gavest
augustus
the
empire
gavest
it
to
nero
too
and
as
vespasian
had
it
from
thee
so
had
julian
though
kings
deface
in
themselves
thy
first
image
in
their
own
soul
thou
givest
no
man
leave
to
deface
thy
second
image
imprinted
indelibly
in
their
power
but
thou
knowest
o
god
that
if
i
should
be
slack
in
celebrating
thy
mercies
to
me
exhibited
by
that
royal
instrument
my
sovereign
to
many
other
faults
that
touch
upon
allegiance
i
should
add
the
worst
of
all
ingratitude
which
constitutes
an
ill
man
and
faults
which
are
defects
in
any
particular
function
are
not
so
great
as
those
that
destroy
our
humanity
it
is
not
so
ill
to
be
an
ill
subject
as
to
be
an
ill
man
for
he
hath
an
universal
illness
ready
to
flow
and
pour
out
itself
into
any
mould
any
form
and
to
spend
itself
in
any
function
as
therefore
thy
son
did
upon
the
coin
i
look
upon
the
king
and
i
ask
whose
image
and
whose
inscription
he
hath
and
he
hath
thine
and
i
give
unto
thee
that
which
is
thine
i
recommend
his
happiness
to
thee
in
all
my
sacrifices
of
thanks
for
that
which
he
enjoys
and
in
all
my
prayers
for
the
continuance
and
enlargement
of
them
but
let
me
stop
my
god
and
consider
will
not
this
look
like
a
piece
of
art
and
cunning
to
convey
into
the
world
an
opinion
that
i
were
more
particular
in
his
care
than
other
men
and
that
herein
in
a
show
of
humility
and
thankfulness
i
magnify
myself
more
than
there
is
cause
but
let
not
that
jealousy
stop
me
o
god
but
let
me
go
forward
in
celebrating
thy
mercy
exhibited
by
him
this
which
he
doth
now
in
assisting
so
my
bodily
health
i
know
is
common
to
me
with
many
many
many
have
tasted
of
that
expression
of
his
graciousness
where
he
can
give
health
by
his
own
hands
he
doth
and
to
more
than
any
of
his
predecessors
have
done
therefore
hath
god
reserved
one
disease
for
him
that
he
only
might
cure
it
though
perchance
not
only
by
one
title
and
interest
nor
only
as
one
king
to
those
that
need
it
not
in
that
kind
and
so
can
not
have
it
by
his
own
hand
he
sends
a
donative
of
health
in
sending
his
physician
the
holy
king
louis
in
france
and
our
maud
is
celebrated
for
that
that
personally
they
visited
hospitals
and
assisted
in
the
cure
even
of
loathsome
diseases
and
when
that
religious
empress
placilla
the
wife
of
theodosius
was
told
that
she
diminished
herself
too
much
in
those
personal
assistances
and
might
do
enough
in
sending
relief
she
said
she
would
send
in
that
capacity
as
a
christian
as
a
of
the
body
of
thy
son
with
them
so
thy
servant
david
applies
himself
to
his
people
so
he
incorporates
himself
in
his
people
by
calling
them
his
brethren
his
bones
his
flesh
and
when
they
fell
under
thy
hand
even
to
the
pretermitting
of
himself
he
presses
upon
thee
by
prayer
for
them
have
sinned
but
these
sheep
what
have
they
done
let
thine
hand
i
pray
thee
be
against
me
and
against
my
it
is
kingly
to
give
when
araunah
gave
that
great
and
free
present
to
david
that
place
those
instruments
for
sacrifice
and
the
sacrifices
themselves
it
is
said
there
by
thy
spirit
these
things
did
araunah
give
as
a
king
to
the
to
give
is
an
approaching
to
the
condition
of
kings
but
to
give
health
an
approaching
to
the
king
of
kings
to
thee
but
this
his
assisting
to
my
bodily
health
thou
knowest
o
god
and
so
do
some
others
of
thine
honourable
servants
know
is
but
the
twilight
of
that
day
wherein
thou
through
him
hast
shined
upon
me
before
but
the
echo
of
that
voice
whereby
thou
through
him
hast
spoke
to
me
before
then
when
he
first
of
any
man
conceived
a
hope
that
i
might
be
of
some
use
in
thy
church
and
descended
to
an
intimation
to
a
persuasion
almost
to
a
solicitation
that
i
would
embrace
that
calling
and
thou
who
hadst
put
that
desire
into
his
heart
didst
also
put
into
mine
an
obedience
to
it
and
i
who
was
sick
before
of
a
vertiginous
giddiness
and
irresolution
and
almost
spent
all
my
time
in
consulting
how
i
should
spend
it
was
by
this
man
of
god
and
god
of
men
put
into
the
pool
and
recovered
when
i
asked
perchance
a
stone
he
gave
me
bread
when
i
asked
perchance
a
scorpion
he
gave
me
a
fish
when
i
asked
a
temporal
office
he
denied
not
refused
not
that
but
let
me
see
that
he
had
rather
i
took
this
these
things
thou
o
god
who
forgettest
nothing
hast
not
forgot
though
perchance
he
because
they
were
benefits
hath
but
i
am
not
only
a
witness
but
an
instance
that
our
jehoshaphat
hath
a
care
to
ordain
priests
as
well
as
judges
and
not
only
to
send
physicians
for
temporal
but
to
be
the
physician
for
spiritual
health
viii
prayer
o
eternal
and
most
gracious
god
who
though
thou
have
reserved
thy
treasure
of
perfect
joy
and
perfect
glory
to
be
given
by
thine
own
hands
then
when
by
seeing
thee
as
thou
art
in
thyself
and
knowing
thee
as
we
are
known
we
shall
possess
in
an
instant
and
possess
for
ever
all
that
can
any
way
conduce
to
our
happiness
yet
here
also
in
this
world
givest
us
such
earnests
of
that
full
payment
as
by
the
value
of
the
earnest
we
may
give
some
estimate
of
the
treasure
humbly
and
thankfully
i
acknowledge
that
thy
blessed
spirit
instructs
me
to
make
a
difference
of
thy
blessings
in
this
world
by
that
difference
of
the
instruments
by
which
it
hath
pleased
thee
to
derive
them
unto
me
as
we
see
thee
here
in
a
glass
so
we
receive
from
thee
here
by
reflection
and
by
instruments
even
casual
things
come
from
thee
and
that
which
we
call
fortune
here

can
scarce

not
name
all
sicknesses
every
thing
that
disorders
a
faculty
and
the

of
that
is
a
sickness
the

not

them
which
are

from

the
pleurisy
is
so

from
the
effect
which
it
works
the
falling
sickness
is
so
they
can
not
have
names
enough
from
what
it
does
nor
where
it
is
but
they
must
extort
names
from
what
it
is

what

but
in
some
one
thing
or

they
would
lack

are

that
question
whether
there
be

is
as
perplexed
in

as
in
any
thing
else
except
it
be
easily
resolved
upon

side
that
there
are
more
sicknesses
than
names
if
ruin
were
reduced
to
that
one
way
that
man
could
perish
no
way
but
by
sickness
yet
his
danger
were
infinite
and
if
sickness
were
reduced
to
that
one
way
that
there
were
no
sickness
but
a
fever
yet
the
way
were
infinite
still
for
it
would
overload
and
oppress
any
natural
disorder
and
discompose
any
artificial
memory
to
deliver
the
names
of
several
fevers
how
intricate
a
work
then
have
they
who
are
gone
to
consult
which
of
these
sicknesses
mine
is
and
then
which
of
these
fevers
and
then
what
it
would
do
and
then
how
it
may
be
countermined
but
even
in
ill
it
is
a
degree
of
good
when
the
evil
will
admit
consultation
in
many
diseases
that
which
is
but
an
accident
but
a
symptom
of
the
main
disease
is
so
violent
that
the
physician
must
attend
the
cure
of
that
though
he
pretermit
so
far
as
to
intermit
the
cure
of
the
disease
itself
is
it
not
so
in
states
too
sometimes
the
insolency
of
those
that
are
great
puts
the
people
into
commotions
the
great
disease
and
the
greatest
danger
to
the
head
is
the
insolency
of
the
great
ones
and
yet
they
execute
martial
law
they
come
to
present
executions
upon
the
people
whose
commotion
was
indeed
but
a
symptom
but
an
accident
of
the
main
disease
but
this
symptom
grown
so
violent
would
allow
no
time
for
a
consultation
is
it
not
so
in
the
accidents
of
the
diseases
of
our
mind
too
is
it
not
evidently
so
in
our
affections
in
our
passions
if
a
choleric
man
be
ready
to
strike
must
i
go
about
to
purge
his
choler
or
to
break
the
blow
but
where
there
is
room
for
consultation
things
are
not
desperate
they
consult
so
there
is
nothing
rashly
inconsiderately
done
and
then
they
prescribe
they
write
so
there
is
nothing
covertly
disguisedly
unavowedly
done
in
bodily
diseases
it
is
not
always
so
sometimes
as
soon
as
the
physician
foot
is
in
the
chamber
his
knife
is
in
the
patient
arm
the
disease
would
not
allow
a
minute
forbearing
of
blood
nor
prescribing
of
other
remedies
in
states
and
matter
of
government
it
is
so
too
they
are
sometimes
surprised
with
such
accidents
as
that
the
magistrate
asks
not
what
may
be
done
by
law
but
does
that
which
must
necessarily
be
done
in
that
case
but
it
is
a
degree
of
good
in
evil
a
degree
that
carries
hope
and
comfort
in
it
when
we
may
have
recourse
to
that
which
is
written
and
that
the
proceedings
may
be
apert
and
ingenuous
and
candid
and
avowable
for
that
gives
satisfaction
and
acquiescence
they
who
have
received
my
anatomy
of
myself
consult
and
end
their
consultation
in
prescribing
and
in
prescribing
physic
proper
and
convenient
remedy
for
if
they
should
come
in
again
and
chide
me
for
some
disorder
that
had
occasioned
and
induced
or
that
had
hastened
and
exalted
this
sickness

if
they
should
begin
to
write
now
rules
for
my

exercise
when
i
were
well
this
were
to
antedate

to
postdate
their
consultation
not
to
give
physic
it
were
rather
a

than
a
relief
to
tell
a
condemned
prisoner
you
might
have

had
done

god
my
god
allow
me
a
just
indignation
a
holy
detestation
of
the
insolency
of
that
man
who
because
he
was
of
that
high
rank
of
whom
thou
hast
said
are
thought
himself
more
than
equal
to
thee
that
king
of
aragon
alphonsus
so
perfect
in
the
motions
of
the
heavenly
bodies
as
that
he
adventured
to
say
that
if
he
had
been
of
counsel
with
thee
in
the
making
of
the
heavens
the
heavens
should
have
been
disposed
in
a
better
order
than
they
are
the
king
amaziah
would
not
endure
thy
prophet
to
reprehend
him
but
asked
him
in
anger
thou
made
of
the
king
counsel
when
thy
prophet
esaias
asks
that
question
hath
directed
the
spirit
of
the
lord
or
being
his
counsellor
hath
taught
him
it
is
after
he
had
settled
and
determined
that
office
upon
thy
son
and
him
only
when
he
joins
with
those
great
titles
the
mighty
god
and
the
prince
of
peace
this
also
the
counsellor
and
after
he
had
settled
upon
him
the
spirit
of
might
and
of
counsel
so
that
then
thou
o
god
though
thou
have
no
counsel
from
man
yet
dost
nothing
upon
man
without
counsel
in
the
making
of
man
there
was
a
consultation
us
make
in
the
preserving
of
man
thou
great
preserver
of
thou
proceedest
by
counsel
for
all
thy
external
works
are
the
works
of
the
whole
trinity
and
their
hand
is
to
every
action
how
much
more
must
i
apprehend
that
all
you
blessed
and
glorious
persons
of
the
trinity
are
in
consultation
now
what
you
will
do
with
this
infirm
body
with
this
leprous
soul
that
attends
guiltily
but
yet
comfortably
your
determination
upon
it
i
offer
not
to
counsel
them
who
meet
in
consultation
for
my
body
now
but
i
open
my
infirmities
i
anatomize
my
body
to
them
so
i
do
my
soul
to
thee
o
my
god
in
an
humble
confession
that
there
is
no
vein
in
me
that
is
not
full
of
the
blood
of
thy
son
whom
i
have
crucified
and
crucified
again
by
multiplying
many
and
often
repeating
the
same
sins
that
there
is
no
artery
in
me
that
hath
not
the
spirit
of
error
the
spirit
of
lust
the
spirit
of
giddiness
in
it
no
bone
in
me
that
is
not
hardened
with
the
custom
of
sin
and
nourished
and
suppled
with
the
marrow
of
sin
no
sinews
no
ligaments
that
do
not
tie
and
chain
sin
and
sin
together
yet
o
blessed
and
glorious
trinity
o
holy
and
whole
college
and
yet
but
one
physician
if
you
take
this
confession
into
a
consultation
my
case
is
not
desperate
my
destruction
is
not
decreed
if
your
consultation
determine
in
writing
if
you
refer
me
to
that
which
is
written
you
intend
my
recovery
for
all
the
way
o
my
god
ever
constant
to
thine
own
ways
thou
hast
proceeded
openly
intelligibly
manifestly
by
the
book
from
thy
first
book
the
book
of
life
never
shut
to
thee
but
never
thoroughly
open
to
us
from
thy
second
book
the
book
of
nature
where
though
subobscurely
and
in
shadows
thou
hast
expressed
thine
own
image
from
thy
third
book
the
scriptures
where
thou
hadst
written
all
in
the
old
and
then
lightedst
us
a
candle
to
read
it
by
in
the
new
testament
to
these
thou
hadst
added
the
book
of
just
and
useful
laws
established
by
them
to
whom
thou
hast
committed
thy
people
to
those
the
manuals
the
pocket
the
bosom
books
of
our
own
consciences
to
those
thy
particular
books
of
all
our
particular
sins
and
to
those
the
books
with
seven
seals
which
only
lamb
which
was
slain
was
found
worthy
to
which
i
hope
it
shall
not
disagree
with
the
meaning
of
thy
blessed
spirit
to
interpret
the
promulgation
of
their
pardon
and
righteousness
who
are
washed
in
the
blood
of
that
lamb
and
if
thou
refer
me
to
these
books
to
a
new
reading
a
new
trial
by
these
books
this
fever
may
be
but
a
burning
in
the
hand
and
i
may
be
saved
though
not
by
my
book
mine
own
conscience
nor
by
thy
other
books
yet
by
thy
first
the
book
of
life
thy
decree
for
my
election
and
by
thy
last
the
book
of
the
lamb
and
the
shedding
of
his
blood
upon
me
if
i
be
still
under
consultation
i
am
not
condemned
yet
if
i
be
sent
to
these
books
i
shall
not
be
condemned
at
all
for
though
there
be
something
written
in
some
of
those
books
particularly
in
the
scriptures
which
some
men
turn
to
poison
yet
upon
these
consultations
these
confessions
these
takings
of
our
particular
cases
into
thy
consideration
thou
intendest
all
for
physic
and
even
from
those
sentences
from
which
a
too
late
repenter
will
suck
desperation
he
that
seeks
thee
early
shall
receive
thy
morning
dew
thy
seasonable
mercy
thy
forward
consolation
ix
prayer
o
eternal
and
most
gracious
god
who
art
of
so
pure
eyes
as
that
thou
canst
not
look
upon
sin
and
we
of
so
unpure
constitutions
as
that
we
can
present
no
object
but
sin
and
therefore
might
justly
fear
that
thou
wouldst
turn
thine
eyes
for
ever
from
us
as
though
we
can
not
endure
afflictions
in
ourselves
yet
in
thee
we
can
so
though
thou
canst
not
endure
sin
in
us
yet
in
thy
son
thou
canst
and
he
hath
taken
upon
himself
and
presented
to
thee
all
those
sins
which
might
displease
thee
in
us
there
is
an
eye
in
nature
that
kills
as
soon
as
it
sees
the
eye
of
a
serpent
no
eye
in
nature
that
nourishes
us
by
looking
upon
us
but
thine
eye
o
lord
does
so
look
therefore
upon
me
o
lord
in
this
distress
and
that
will
recall
me
from
the
borders
of
this
bodily
death
look
upon
me
and
that
will
raise
me
again
from
that
spiritual
death
in
which
my
parents
buried
me
when
they
begot
me
in
sin
and
in
which
i
have
pierced
even
to
the
jaws
of
hell
by
multiplying
such
heaps
of
actual
sins
upon
that
foundation
that
root
of
original
sin
yet
take
me
again
into
your
consultation
o
blessed
and
glorious
trinity
and
though
the
father
know
that
i
have
defaced
his
image
received
in
my
creation
though
the
son
know
i
have
neglected
mine
interest
in
the
redemption
yet
o
blessed
spirit
as
thou
art
to
my
conscience
so
be
to
them
a
witness
that
at
this
minute
i
accept
that
which
i
have
so
often
so
rebelliously
refused
thy
blessed
inspirations
be
thou
my
witness
to
them
that
at
more
pores
than
this
slack
body
sweats
tears
this
sad
soul
weeps
blood
and
more
for
the
displeasure
of
my
god
than
for
the
stripes
of
his
displeasure
take
me
then
o
blessed
and
glorious
trinity
into
a
reconsultation
and
prescribe
me
any
physic
if
it
be
a
long
and
painful
holding
of
this
soul
in
sickness
it
is
physic
if
i
may
discern
thy
hand
to
give
it
and
it
is
physic
if
it
be
a
speedy
departing
of
this
soul
if
i
may
discern
thy
hand
to
receive
it

out
though
the
dogstar
have
a
pestilent
breath
an
infectious
exhalation
yet
because
we
know
when
it
will
rise
we
clothe
ourselves
and
we
diet
ourselves
and
we
shadow
ourselves
to
a
sufficient
prevention
but
comets
and
blazing
stars
whose
effects
or
significations
no
man
can
interrupt
or
frustrate
no
man
foresaw
no
almanack
tells
us
when
a
blazing
star
will
break
out
the
matter
is
carried
up
in
secret
no
astrologer
tells
us
when
the
effects
will
be
accomplished
for
that
is
a
secret
of
a
higher
sphere
than
the
other
and
that
which
is
most
secret
is
most
dangerous
it
is
so
also
here
in
the
societies
of
men
in
states
and
commonwealths
twenty
rebellious
drums
make
not
so
dangerous
a
noise
as
a
few
whisperers
and
secret
plotters
in
corners
the
cannon
doth
not
so
much
hurt
against
a
wall
as
a
mine
under
the
wall
nor
a
thousand
enemies
that
threaten
so
much
as
a
few
that
take
an
oath
to
say
nothing
god
knew
many
heavy
sins
of
the
people
in
the
wilderness
and
after
but
still
he
charges
them
with
that
one
with
murmuring
murmuring
in
their
hearts
secret
disobediences
secret
repugnances
against
his
declared
will
and
these
are
the
most
deadly
the
most
pernicious
and
it
is
so
too
with
the
diseases
of
the
body
and
that
is
my
case
the
pulse
the
urine
the
sweat
all
have
sworn
to
say
nothing
to
give
no
indication
of
any
dangerous
sickness
my
forces
are
not
enfeebled
i
find
no
decay
in
my
strength
my
provisions
are
not
cut
off
i
find
no
abhorring
in
mine
appetite
my
counsels
are
not
corrupted
nor
infatuated
i
find
no
false
apprehensions
to
work
upon
mine
understanding
and
yet
they
see
that
invisibly
and
i
feel
that
insensibly
the
disease
prevails
the
disease
hath
established
a
kingdom
an
empire
in
me
and
will
have
certain
secrets
of
state
by
which
it
will
proceed
and
not
be
bound
to
declare
them
but
yet
against
those
secret
conspiracies
in
the
state
the
magistrate
hath
the
rack
and
against
these
insensible
diseases
physicians
have
their
examiners
and
those
these
employ
now
expostulation
my
god
my
god
i
have
been
told
and
told
by
relation
by
her
own
brother
that
did
it
by
thy
servant
nazianzen
that
his
sister
in
the
vehemency
of
her
prayer
did
use
to
threaten
thee
with
a
holy
importunity
with
a
pious
impudency
i
dare
not
do
so
o
god
but
as
thy
servant
augustine
wished
that
adam
had
not
sinned
therefore
that
christ
might
not
have
died
may
i
not
to
this
one
purpose
wish
that
if
the
serpent
before
the
temptation
of
eve
did
go
upright
and
speak
that
he
did
so
still
because
i
should
the
sooner
hear
him
if
he
spoke
the
sooner
see
him
if
he
went
upright
in
his
curse
i
am
cursed
too
his
creeping
undoes
me
for
howsoever
he
begin
at
the
heel
and
do
but
bruise
that
yet
he
and
in
him
come
into
our
into
our
eyes
and
ears
the
entrances
and
inlets
of
our
soul
he
works
upon
us
in
secret
and
we
do
not
discern
him
and
one
great
work
of
his
upon
us
is
to
make
us
so
like
himself
as
to
sin
in
secret
that
others
may
not
see
us
but
his
masterpiece
is
to
make
us
sin
in
secret
so
as
that
we
may
not
see
ourselves
sin
for
the
first
the
hiding
of
our
sins
from
other
men
he
hath
induced
that
which
was
his
offspring
from
the
beginning
a
lie
for
man
is
in
nature
yet
in
possession
of
some
such
sparks
of
ingenuity
and
nobleness
as
that
but
to
disguise
evil
he
would
not
lie
the
body
the
sin
is
the
serpent
and
the
garment
that
covers
it
the
lie
is
his
too
these
are
his
but
the
hiding
of
sin
from
ourselves
is
he
himself
when
we
have
the
sting
of
the
serpent
in
us
and
do
not
sting
ourselves
the
venom
of
sin
and
no
remorse
for
sin
then
as
thy
blessed
son
said
of
judas
is
a
not
that
he
had
one
but
was
one
so
we
are
become
devils
to
ourselves
and
we
have
not
only
a
serpent
in
our
bosom
but
we
ourselves
are
to
ourselves
that
serpent
how
far
did
thy
servant
david
press
upon
thy
pardon
in
that
petition
thou
me
from
secret
can
any
sin
be
secret
for
a
great
part
of
our
sins
though
says
thy
prophet
we
conceive
them
in
the
dark
upon
our
bed
yet
says
he
we
do
them
in
the
light
there
are
many
sins
which
we
glory
in
doing
and
would
not
do
if
nobody
should
know
them
thy
blessed
servant
augustine
confesses
that
he
was
ashamed
of
his
shamefacedness
and
tenderness
of
conscience
and
that
he
often
belied
himself
with
sins
which
he
never
did
lest
he
should
be
unacceptable
to
his
sinful
companions
but
if
we
would
conceal
them
thy
prophet
found
such
a
desire
and
such
a
practice
in
some
when
he
said
hast
trusted
in
thy
wickedness
and
thou
hast
said
none
shall
see
yet
can
we
conceal
them
thou
o
god
canst
hear
of
them
by
others
the
voice
of
abel
blood
will
tell
thee
of
cain
murder
the
heavens
themselves
will
tell
thee
heaven
shall
reveal
his
iniquity
a
small
creature
alone
shall
do
it
bird
of
the
air
shall
carry
the
voice
and
tell
the
thou
wilt
trouble
no
informer
thou
thyself
revealedst
adam
sin
to
thyself
and
the
manifestation
of
sin
is
so
full
to
thee
as
that
thou
shalt
reveal
all
to
all
shalt
bring
every
work
to
judgment
with
every
secret
thing
and
there
is
nothing
covered
that
shall
not
be
but
o
my
god
there
is
another
way
of
knowing
my
sins
which
thou
lovest
better
than
any
of
these
to
know
them
by
my
confession
as
physic
works
so
it
draws
the
peccant
humour
to
itself
that
when
it
is
gathered
together
the
weight
of
itself
may
carry
that
humour
away
so
thy
spirit
returns
to
my
memory
my
former
sins
that
being
so
recollected
they
may
pour
out
themselves
by
confession
i
kept
says
thy
servant
david
and
night
thy
hand
was
heavy
upon
but
when
i
said
will
confess
my
transgressions
unto
the
lord
thou
forgavest
the
iniquity
of
my
thou
interpretest
the
very
purpose
of
confession
so
well
as
that
thou
scarce
leavest
any
new
mercy
for
the
action
itself
this
mercy
thou
leavest
that
thou
armest
us
thereupon
against
relapses
into
the
sins
which
we
have
confessed
and
that
mercy
which
thy
servant
augustine
apprehends
when
he
says
to
thee
thou
hast
forgiven
me
those
sins
which
i
have
done
and
those
sins
which
only
by
thy
grace
i
have
not
done
they
were
done
in
our
inclination
to
them
and
even
that
inclination
needs
thy
mercy
and
that
mercy
he
calls
a
pardon
and
these
are
most
truly
secret
sins
because
they
were
never
done
and
because
no
other
man
nor
i
myself
but
only
thou
knowest
how
many
and
how
great
sins
i
have
escaped
by
thy
grace
which
without
that
i
should
have
multiplied
against
thee
x
prayer
o
eternal
and
most
gracious
god
who
as
thy
son
christ
jesus
though
he
knew
all
things
yet
said
he
knew
not
the
day
of
judgment
because
he
knew
it
not
so
as
that
he
might
tell
us
so
though
thou
knowest
all
my
sins
yet
thou
knowest
them
not
to
my
comfort
except
thou
know
them
by
my
telling
them
to
thee
how
shall
i
bring
to
thy
knowledge
by
that
way
those
sins
which
i
myself
know
not
if
i
accuse
myself
of
original
sin
wilt
thou
ask
me
if
i
know
what
original
sin
is
i
know
not
enough
of
it
to
satisfy
others
but
i
know
enough
to
condemn
myself
and
to
solicit
thee
if
i
confess
to
thee
the
sins
of
my
youth
wilt
thou
ask
me
if
i
know
what
those
sins
were
i
know
them
not
so
well
as
to
name
them
all
nor
am
sure
to
live
hours
enough
to
name
them
all
for
i
did
them
then
faster
than
i
can
speak
them
now
when
every
thing
that
i
did
conduced
to
some
sin
but
i
know
them
so
well
as
to
know
that
nothing
but
thy
mercy
is
so
infinite
as
they
if
the
naming
of
sins
of
thought
word
and
deed
of
sins
of
omission
and
of
action
of
sins
against
thee
against
my
neighbour
and
against
myself
of
sins
unrepented
and
sins
relapsed
into
after
repentance
of
sins
of
ignorance
and
sins
against
the
testimony
of
my
conscience
of
sins
against
thy
commandments
sins
against
thy
son
prayer
and
sins
against
our
own
creed
of
sins
against
the
laws
of
that
church
and
sins
against
the
laws
of
that
state
in
which
thou
hast
given
me
my
station
if
the
naming
of
these
sins
reach
not
home
to
all
mine
i
know
what
will
o
lord
pardon
me
me
all
those
sins
which
thy
son
christ
jesus
suffered
for
who
suffered
for
all
the
sins
of
all
the
world
for
there
is
no
sin
amongst
all
those
which
had
not
been
my
sin
if
thou
hadst
not
been
my
god
and
antedated
me
a
pardon
in
thy
preventing
grace
and
since
sin
in
the
nature
of
it
retains
still
so
much
of
the
author
of
it
that
it
is
a
serpent
insensibly
insinuating
itself
into
my
soul
let
thy
brazen
serpent
the
contemplation
of
thy
son
crucified
for
me
be
evermore
present
to
me
for
my
recovery
against
the
sting
of
the
first
serpent
that
so
as
i
have
a
lion
against
a
lion
the
lion
of
the
tribe
of
judah
against
that
lion
that
seeks
whom
he
may
devour
so
i
may
have
a
serpent
against
a
serpent
the
wisdom
of
the
serpent
against
the
malice
of
the
serpent
and
both
against
that
lion
and
serpent
forcible
and
subtle
temptations
thy
dove
with
thy
olive
in
thy
ark
humility
and
peace
and
reconciliation
to
thee
by

whence

we
take
a

a

demonstration
that
all
the
greatness
of
this
world
is
built
upon
opinion
of

and
hath
in
itself
no
real
being
nor
power
of

than
from
the
heart
of
man
it
is
always
in
action
and
motion
still
busy
still
pretending
to
do
all
to
furnish
all
the
powers
and
faculties
with
all
that
they
have
but
if
an
enemy
dare
rise
up
against
it
it
is
the
soonest
endangered
the
soonest
defeated
of
any
part
the
brain
will
hold
out
longer
than
it
and
the
liver
longer
than
that
they
will
endure
a
siege
but
an
unnatural
heat
a
rebellious
heat
will
blow
up
the
heart
like
a
mine
in
a
minute
but
howsoever
since
the
heart
hath
the
birthright
and
primogeniture
and
that
it
is
nature
eldest
son
in
us
the
part
which
is
first
born
to
life
in
man
and
that
the
other
parts
as
younger
brethren
and
servants
in
his
family
have
a
dependance
upon
it
it
is
reason
that
the
principal
care
be
had
of
it
though
it
be
not
the
strongest
part
as
the
eldest
is
oftentimes
not
the
strongest
of
the
family
and
since
the
brain
and
liver
and
heart
hold
not
a
triumvirate
in
man
a
sovereignty
equally
shed
upon
them
all
for
his
as
the
four
elements
do
for
his
very
being
but
the
heart
alone
is
in
the
principality
and
in
the
throne
as
king
the
rest
as
subjects
though
in
eminent
place
and
office
must
contribute
to
that
as
children
to
their
parents
as
all
persons
to
all
kinds
of
superiors
though
oftentimes
those
parents
or
those
superiors
be
not
of
stronger
parts
than
themselves
that
serve
and
obey
them
that
are
weaker
neither
doth
this
obligation
fall
upon
us
by
second
dictates
of
nature
by
consequences
and
conclusions
arising
out
of
nature
or
derived
from
nature
by
discourse
as
many
things
bind
us
even
by
the
law
of
nature
and
yet
not
by
the
primary
law
of
nature
as
all
laws
of
propriety
in
that
which
we
possess
are
of
the
law
of
nature
which
law
is
to
give
every
one
his
own
and
yet
in
the
primary
law
of
nature
there
was
no
propriety
no
et
but
an
universal
community
overall
so
the
obedience
of
superiors
is
of
the
law
of
nature
and
yet
in
the
primary
law
of
nature
there
was
no
superiority
no
magistracy
but
this
contribution
of
assistance
of
all
to
the
sovereign
of
all
parts
to
the
heart
is
from
the
very
first
dictates
of
nature
which
is
in
the
first
place
to
have
care
of
our
own
preservation
to
look
first
to
ourselves
for
therefore
doth
the
physician
intermit
the
present
care
of
brain
or
liver
because
there
is
a
possibility
that
they
may
subsist
though
there
be
not
a
present
and
a
particular
care
had
of
them
but
there
is
no
possibility
that
they
can
subsist
if
the
heart
perish
and
so
when
we
seem
to
begin
with
others
in
such
assistances
indeed
we
do
begin
with
ourselves
and
we
ourselves
are
principally
in
our
contemplation
and
so
all
these
officious
and
mutual
assistances
are
but
compliments
towards
others
and
our
true
end
is
ourselves
and
this
is
the
reward
of
the
pains
of
kings
sometimes
they
need
the
power
of
law
to
be
obeyed
and
when
they
seem
to
be
obeyed
voluntarily
they
who
do
it
do
it
for
their
own
sakes
o
how
little
a
thing
is
all
the
greatness
of
man
and
through
how
false
glasses
doth
he
make
shift
to
multiply
it
and
magnify
it
to
himself
and
yet
this
is
also
another
misery
of
this
king
of
man
the
heart
which
is
also
applicable
to
the
kings
of
this
world
great
men
that
the
venom
and
poison
of
every
pestilential
disease
directs
itself
to
the
heart
affects
that
pernicious
affection
and
the
malignity
of
ill
men
is
also
directed
upon
the
greatest
and
the
best
and
not
only
greatness
but
goodness
loses
the
vigour
of
being
an
antidote
or
cordial
against
it
and
as
the
noblest
and
most
generous
cordials
that
nature
or
art
afford
or
can
prepare
if
they
be
often
taken
and
made
familiar
become
no
cordials
nor
have
any
extraordinary
operation
so
the
greatest
cordial
of
the
heart
patience
if
it
be
much
exercised
exalts
the
venom
and
the
malignity
of
the
enemy
and
the
more
we
suffer
the
more
we
are
insulted
upon
when
god
had
made
this
earth
of
nothing
it
was
but
a
little
help
that
he
had
to
make
other
things
of
this
earth
nothing
can
be
nearer
nothing
than
this
earth
and
yet
how
little
of
this
earth
is
the
greatest
man
he
thinks
he
treads
upon
the
earth
that
all
is
under
his
feet
and
the
brain
that
thinks
so
is
but
earth
his
highest
region
the
flesh
that
covers
that
is
but
earth
and
even
the
top
of
that
that
wherein
so
many
absaloms
take
so
much
pride
is
but
a
bush
growing
upon
that
turf
of
earth
how
little
of
the
world
is
the
earth
and
yet
that
is
all
that
man
hath
or
is
how
little
of
a
man
is
the
heart
and
yet
it
is
all
by
which
he
is
and
this
continually
subject
not
only
to
foreign
poisons
conveyed
by
others
but
to
intestine
poisons
bred
in
ourselves
by
pestilential
sicknesses
o
who
if
before
he
had
a
being
he
could
have
sense
of
this
misery
would
buy

thou

thou

it

all
these
gradations
in
the
ill
of
our

every
imagination
of

of

evil
dost
thou

thou

my

o

of

thou
knowest
all
and
it
is
thou
that
declarest
unto
man
what
is
his
heart
without
thee
o
sovereign
goodness
i
could
not
know
how
ill
my
heart
were
thou
hast
declared
unto
me
in
thy
word
that
for
all
this
deluge
of
evil
that
hath
surrounded
all
hearts
yet
thou
soughtest
and
foundest
a
man
after
thine
own
heart
that
thou
couldst
and
wouldst
give
thy
people
pastors
according
to
thine
own
heart
and
i
can
gather
out
of
thy
word
so
good
testimony
of
the
hearts
of
men
as
to
find
single
hearts
docile
and
apprehensive
hearts
hearts
that

that

learned

in

straight

no
perverseness
without
and
clean
hearts
no
foulness
within
such
hearts
i
can
find
in
thy
word
and
if
my
heart
were
such
a
heart
i
would
give
thee
my
heart
but
i
find
stony
hearts
too
and
i
have
made
mine
such
i
have
found
hearts
that
are
snares
and
i
have
conversed
with
such
hearts
that
burn
like
ovens
and
the
fuel
of
lust
and
envy
and
ambition
hath
inflamed
mine
hearts
in
which
their
masters
trust
and
that
trusteth
in
his
own

is
a
his
confidence
in
his
own
moral
constancy

civil
fortitude

betray
him
when
thou
shalt
cast
a
spiritual
damp
a
heaviness
and

of

upon

these

a

such

it

the

is
thine

this

this

this

this

thou
thou
o
my

perfumed
vapour
with
thine
own
breath
with
so
many
sweet
acceptations
in
thine
own
word
and
shall
this

receive
an
ill
and
infectious
sense
it
must
for
since
we
have
displeased
thee
with
that
which
is
but
vapour
for
what
is
sin
but
a
vapour
but
a
smoke
though
such
a
smoke
as
takes
away
our
sight
and
disables
us
from
seeing
our
danger
it
is
just
that
thou
punish
us
with
vapours
too
for
so
thou
dost
as
the
wise
man
tells
us
thou
canst
punish
us
by
those
things
wherein
we
offend
thee
as
he
hath
expressed
it
there
beasts
newly
created
breathing
therefore
that
commination
of
thine
by
thy
prophet
will
show
wonders
in
the
heaven
and
in
the
earth
blood
and
fire
and
pillars
of
thine
apostle
who
knew

best

prophet
presents
thee
in
thy
terribleness
so
went
out
a
smoke
at
his
and
another
the
effect
of
thine
anger
so
house
was
filled
with
and
he
that
continues
his
prophecy
as
long
as
the
world
can
continue
describes
the
miseries
of
the
latter
times
so
of
the
bottomless
pit
arose
a
smoke
that
darkened
the
sun
and
out
of
that
smoke
came
locusts
who
had
the
power
of
now
all
smokes
begin
in
fire
and
all
these
will
end
so
too
the
smoke
of
sin
and
of
thy
wrath
will
end
in
the
fire
of
hell
but
hast
thou
afforded
us
no
means
to
evaporate
these
smokes
to
withdraw
these
vapours
when
thine
angels
fell
from
heaven
thou
tookest
into
thy
care
the
reparation
of
that
place
and
didst
it
by
assuming
by
drawing
us
thither
when
we
fell
from
thee
here
in
this
world
thou
tookest
into
thy
care
the
reparation
of
this
place
too
and
didst
it
by
assuming
us
another
way
by
descending
down
to
assume
our
nature
in
thy
son
so
that
though
our
last
act
be
an
ascending
to
glory
we
shall
ascend
to
the
place
of
angels
yet
our
first
act
is
to
go
the
way
of
thy
son
descending
and
the
way
of
thy
blessed
spirit
too
who
descended
in
the
dove
therefore
hast
thou
been
pleased
to
afford
us
this
remedy
in
nature
by
this
application
of
a
dove
to
our
lower
parts
to
make
these
vapours
in
our
bodies
to
descend
and
to
make
that
a
type
to
us
that
by
the
visitation
of
thy
spirit
the
vapours
of
sin
shall
descend
and
we
tread
them
under
our
feet
at
the
baptism
of
thy
son
the
dove
descended
and
at
the
exalting
of
thine
apostles
to
preach
the
same
spirit
descended
let
us
draw
down
the
vapours
of
our
own
pride
our
own
wits
our
own
wills
our
own
inventions
to
the
simplicity
of
thy
sacraments
and
the
obedience
of
thy
word
and

thus
applied
shall
make

prayer
o
eternal
and
most
gracious
god
who
though
thou
have
suffered
us
to
destroy
ourselves
and
hast
not
given
us
the
power
of

in
ourselves
hast
yet
afforded
us
such

of
reparation
as
may
easily
and
familiarly
be
compassed
by
us
prosper
i
humbly
beseech
thee
this
means
of
bodily
assistance
in
this
thy
ordinary
creature
and
prosper
thy
means
of
spiritual
assistance
in
thy
holy
ordinances
and
as
thou
hast
carried
this
thy
creature
the
dove
through
all
thy
ways
through
nature
and
made
it
naturally
proper
to
conduce
medicinally
to
our
bodily
health
through
the
law
and
made
it
a
sacrifice
for
sin
there
and
through
the
gospel
and
made
it
and
thy
spirit
in
it
a
witness
of
thy
son
baptism
there
so
carry
it
and
the
qualities
of
it
home
to
my
soul

imprint
there
that
simplicity
that
mildness
that
harmlessness
which
thou
hast
imprinted
by
nature
in
this
creature
that
so
all
vapours
of
all
disobedience
to
thee
being
subdued
under
my
feet
i
may
in
the
power
and
triumph
of
thy
son
tread
victoriously
upon
my
grave
and
trample
upon
the
lion
and
dragon
that
lie

it

devour
me
thou
o
lord
by
the
prophet
callest
the
dove
the
of
the
but
promisest
that
the
of
the
valleys
shall
be
upon
the
as
thou
hast
laid
me
low
in
this
valley
of
sickness
so
low

fit

question
asked
in

can

carry
me
up

mountains

thou
affordest
me
a

thou
dwellest

holy
hill
unto
which
none
can
ascend

hath
clean

meditation
we
say
that
the
world
is
made
of
sea
and
land
as
though
they
were
equal
but
we
know
that
there
is
more
sea
in
the
western
than
in
the
eastern
hemisphere
we
say
that
the
firmament
is
full
of
stars
as
though
it
were
equally
full
but
we
know
that
there
are
more
stars
under
the
northern
than
under
the
southern
pole
we
say
the
elements
of
man
are
misery
and
happiness
as
though
he
had
an
equal
proportion
of
both
and
the
days
of
man
vicissitudinary
as
though
he
had
as
many
good
days
as
ill
and
that
he
lived
under
a
perpetual
equinoctial
night
and
day
equal
good
and
ill
fortune
in
the
same
measure
but
it
is
far
from
that
he
drinks
misery
and
he
tastes
happiness
he
mows
misery
and
he
gleans
happiness
he
journeys
in
misery
he
does
but
walk
in
happiness
and
which
is
worst
his
misery
is
positive
and
dogmatical
his
happiness
is
but
disputable
and
problematical
all
men
call
misery
misery
but
happiness
changes
the
name
by
the
taste
of
man
in
this
accident
that
befalls
me
now
that
this
sickness
declares
itself
by
spots
to
be
a
malignant
and
pestilential
disease
if
there
be
a
comfort
in
the
declaration
that
thereby
the
physicians
see
more
clearly
what
to
do
there
may
be
as
much
discomfort
in
this
that
the
malignity
may
be
so
great
as
that
all
that
they
can
do
shall
do
nothing
that
an
enemy
declares
himself
then
when
he
is
able
to
subsist
and
to
pursue
and
to
achieve
his
ends
is
no
great
comfort
in
intestine
conspiracies
voluntary
confessions
do
more
good
than
confessions
upon
the
rack
in
these
infections
when
nature
herself
confesses
and
cries
out
by
these
outward
declarations
which
she
is
able
to
put
forth
of
herself
they
minister
comfort
but
when
all
is
by
the
strength
of
cordials
it
is
but
a
confession
upon
the
rack
by
which
though
we
come
to
know
the
malice
of
that
man
yet
we
do
not
know
whether
there
be
not
as
much
malice
in
his
heart
then
as
before
his
confession
we
are
sure
of
his
treason
but
not
of
his
repentance
sure
of
him
but
not
of
his
accomplices
it
is
a
faint
comfort
to
know
the
worst
when
the
worst
is
remediless
and
a
weaker
than
that
to
know
much
ill
and
not
to
know
that
that
is
the
worst
a
woman
is
comforted
with
the
birth
of
her
son
her
body
is
eased
of
a
burden
but
if
she
could
prophetically
read
his
history
how
ill
a
man
perchance
how
ill
a
son
he
would
prove
she
should
receive
a
greater

i
do

present
him
with

which
is
his

till
i
do

withhold
his
right

therefore
thou
seest
them
upon

as
his

seest
them

shall
not

me

decline
my

hell
thy

these

is

begin
in

which
shall
outlive

what
a

is
man
life
in

of
the
sun
or
of
a

and
yet
how
little
of
our
life
is
occasion
opportunity
to
receive
good
in
and
how
little
of
that
occasion
do
we
apprehend
and
lay
hold
of
how
busy
and
perplexed
a
cobweb
is
the
happiness
of
man
here
that
must
be
made
up
with
a
watchfulness
to
lay

upon
occasion
which
is

a
little
piece

nothing

honours

lose
their
office

lose
their
name
they
are
not
honours
to
us
that
shall
never
appear
nor
come
abroad
into
the
eyes
of
the
people
to
receive
honour
from
them
who
give
it

who

youth
is
their

that
judges
them
that
denominates

that
inanimates
and
informs
them
and
makes
them

when

in

they
come
as
a
cordial
when
the
bell
rings
out
as
a
pardon
when
the
head
is
off
we
rejoice
in
the
comfort
of
fire
but
does
any
man
cleave
to
it
at
midsummer
we
are
glad
of
the
freshness
and
coolness
of
a
vault
but
does
any
man
keep
his
christmas
there
or
are
the

of

acceptable
in

expostulation
my
god
my
god
wouldst
thou
call
thyself
the
ancient
of
days
if
we
were
not
to
call
ourselves
to
an
account
for
our
days
wouldst
thou
chide
us
for
idle
here
all
the
if
we
were
sure
to
have
more
days
to
make
up
our
harvest
when
thou
bidst
us
no
thought
for
for
sufficient
unto
the
to
every
day
the
evil
is
this
truly
absolutely
to
put
off
all
that
concerns
the
present
life
when
thou
reprehendest
the
galatians
by
thy
message
to
them
they
observed
days
and
months
and
times
and
when
thou
sendest
by
the
same
messenger
to
forbid
the
colossians
all
critical
days
indicatory
days
no
man
judge
you
in
respect
of
a
holy
day
or
of
a
new
moon
or
of
a
dost
thou
take
away
all
consideration
all
distinction
of
days
though
thou
remove
them
from
being
of
the
essence
of
our
salvation
thou
leavest
them
for
assistances
and
for
the
exaltation
of
our
devotion
to
fix
ourselves
at
certain
periodical
and
stationary
times
upon
the
consideration
of
those
things
which
thou
hast
done
for
us
and
the
crisis
the
trial
the
judgment
how
those
things
have
wrought
upon
us
and
disposed
us
to
a
spiritual
recovery
and
convalescence
for
there
is
to
every
man
a
day
of
salvation
is
the
accepted
time
now
is
the
day
of
and
there
is
great
day
of
thy
which
no
man
shall
be
able
to
stand
in
and
there
are
evil
days
before
and
therefore
thou
warnest
us
and
armest
us
unto
you
the
whole
armour
of
god
that
you
may
be
able
to
stand
in
the
evil
so
far
then
our
days
must
be
critical
to
us
as
that
by
consideration
of
them
we
may
make
a
judgment
of
our
spiritual
health
for
that
is
the
crisis
of
our
bodily
health
thy
beloved
servant
john
wishes
to
gaius
he
may
prosper
in
his
health
so
as
his
soul
for
if
the
soul
be
lean
the
marrow
of
the
body
is
but
water
if
the
soul
wither
the
verdure
and
the
good
estate
of
the
body
is
but
an
illusion
and
the
goodliest
man
a
fearful
ghost
shall
we
o
my
god
determine
our
thoughts
and
shall
we
never
determine
our
disputations
upon
our
climacterical
years
for
particular
men
and
periodical
years
for
the
life
of
states
and
kingdoms
and
never
consider
these
in
our
long
life
and
our
interest
in
the
everlasting
kingdom
we
have
exercised
our
curiosity
in
observing
that
adam
the
eldest
of
the
eldest
world
died
in
his
climacterical
year
and
shem
the
eldest
son
of
the
next
world
in
his
abraham
the
father
of
the
faithful
in
his
and
the
blessed
virgin
mary
the
garden
where
the
root
of
faith
grew
in
hers
but
they
whose
climacterics
we
observe
employed
their
observation
upon
their
critical
days
the
working
of
thy
promise
of
a
messias
upon
them
and
shall
we
o
my
god
make
less
use
of
those
days
who
have
more
of
them
we
who
have
not
only
the
day
of
the
prophets
the
first
days
but
the
last
days
in
which
thou
hast
spoken
unto
us
by
thy
son
we
are
the
children
of
the
day
for
thou
hast
shined
in
as
full
a
noon
upon
us
as
upon
the
thessalonians
they
who
were
of
the
night
a
night
which
they
had
superinduced
upon
themselves
the
pharisees
pretended
if
they
had
been
in
their
fathers
those
indicatory
and
judicatory
those
critical
days
would
not
have
been
partakers
of
the
blood
of
the
and
shall
we
who
are
in
the
day
these
days
not
of
the
prophets
but
of
the
son
stone
those
prophets
again
and
crucify
that
son
again
for
all
those
evident
indications
and
critical
judicatures
which
are
afforded
us
those
opposed
adversaries
of
thy
son
the
pharisees
with
the
herodians
watched
a
critical
day
then
when
the
state
was
incensed
against
him
came
to
tempt
him
in
the
dangerous
question
of
tribute
they
left
him
and
that
day
was
the
critical
day
to
the
sadducees
the
same
day
says
thy
spirit
in
thy
word
the
sadducees
came
to
him
to
question
him
about
the
resurrection
and
them
he
silenced
they
left
him
and
this
was
the
critical
day
for
the
scribe
expert
in
the
law
who
thought
himself
learneder
than
the
herodian
the
pharisee
or
sadducee
and
he
tempted
him
about
the
great
commandment
and
him
christ
left
without
power
of
replying
when
all
was
done
and
that
they
went
about
to
begin
their
circle
of
vexation
and
temptation
again
christ
silences
them
so
that
as
they
had
taken
their
critical
days
to
come
in
that
and
in
that
day
so
christ
imposes
a
critical
day
upon
them
that
day
says
thy
spirit
man
durst
ask
him
any
more
this
o
my
god
my
most
blessed
god
is
a
fearful
crisis
a
fearful
indication
when
we
will
study
and
seek
and
find
what
days
are
fittest
to
forsake
thee
in
to
say
now
religion
is
in
a
neutrality
in
the
world
and
this
is
my
day
the
day
of
liberty
now
i
may
make
new
friends
by
changing
my
old
religion
and
this
is
my
day
the
day
of
advancement
but
o
my
god
with
thy
servant
jacob
holy
boldness
who
though
thou
lamedst
him
would
not
let
thee
go
till
thou
hadst
given
him
a
blessing
though
thou
have
laid
me
upon
my
hearse
yet
thou
shalt
not
depart
from
me
from
this
bed
till
thou
have
given
me
a
crisis
a
judgment
upon
myself
this
day
since
day
is
as
a
thousand
years
with
let
o
lord
a
day
be
as
a
week
to
me
and
in
this
one
let
me
consider
seven
days
seven
critical
days
and
judge
myself
that
i
be
not
judged
by
thee
first
this
is
the
day
of
thy
visitation
thy
coming
to
me
and
would
i
look
to
be
welcome
to
thee
and
not
entertain
thee
in
thy
coming
to
me
we
measure
not
the
visitations
of
great
persons
by
their
apparel
by
their
equipage
by
the
solemnity
of
their
coming
but
by
their
very
coming
and
therefore
howsoever
thou
come
it
is
a
crisis
to
me
that
thou
wouldst
not
lose
me
who
seekest
me
by
any
means
this
leads
me
from
my
first
day
thy
visitation
by
sickness
to
a
second
to
the
light
and
testimony
of
my
conscience
there
i
have
an
evening
and
a
morning
a
sad
guiltiness
in
my
soul
but
yet
a
cheerful
rising
of
thy
sun
too
thy
evenings
and
mornings
made
days
in
the
creation
and
there
is
no
mention
of
nights
my
sadnesses
for
sins
are
evenings
but
they
determine
not
in
night
but
deliver
me
over
to
the
day
the
day
of
a
conscience
dejected
but
then
rectified
accused
but
then
acquitted
by
thee
by
him
who
speaks
thy
word
and
who
is
thy
word
thy
son
from
this
day
the
crisis
and
examination
of
my
conscience
breaks
out
my
third
day
my
day
of
preparing
and
fitting
myself
for
a
more
especial
receiving
of
thy
son
in
his
institution
of
the
sacrament
in
which
day
though
there
be
many
dark
passages
and
slippery
steps
to
them
who
will
entangle
and
endanger
themselves
in
unnecessary
disputations
yet
there
are
light
hours
enough
for
any
man
to
go
his
whole
journey
intended
by
thee
to
know
that
that
bread
and
wine
is
not
more
really
assimilated
to
my
body
and
to
my
blood
than
the
body
and
blood
of
thy
son
is
communicated
to
me
in
that
action
and
participation
of
that
bread
and
that
wine
and
having
o
my
god
walked
with
thee
these
three
days
the
day
of
thy
visitation
the
day
of
my
conscience
the
day
of
preparing
for
this
seal
of
reconciliation
i
am
the
less
afraid
of
the
clouds
or
storms
of
my
fourth
day
the
day
of
my
dissolution
and
transmigration
from
hence
nothing
deserves
the
name
of
happiness
that
makes
the
remembrance
of
death
bitter
and
death
how
bitter
is
the
remembrance
of
thee
to
a
man
that
lives
at
rest
in
his
possessions
the
man
that
hath
nothing
to
vex
him
yea
unto
him
that
is
able
to
receive
meat
therefore
hast
thou
o
my
god
made
this
sickness
in
which
i
am
not
able
to
receive
meat
my
fasting
day
my
eve
to
this
great
festival
my
dissolution
and
this
day
of
death
shall
deliver
me
over
to
my
fifth
day
the
day
of
my
resurrection
for
how
long
a
day
soever
thou
make
that
day
in
the
grave
yet
there
is
no
day
between
that
and
the
resurrection
then
we
shall
all
be
invested
reapparelled
in
our
own
bodies
but
they
who
have
made
just
use
of
their
former
days
be
with
glory
whereas
the
others
condemned
to
their
old
clothes
their
sinful
bodies
shall
have
nothing
added
but
immortality
to
torment
and
this
day
of
awaking
me
and
reinvesting
my
soul
in
my
body
and
my
body
in
the
body
of
christ
shall
present
me
body
and
soul
to
my
sixth
day
the
day
of
judgment
which
is
truly
and
most
literally
the
critical
the
decretory
day
both
because
all
judgment
shall
be
manifested
to
me
then
and
i
shall
assist
in
judging
the
world
then
and
because
then
that
judgment
shall
declare
to
me
and
possess
me
of
my
seventh
day
my
everlasting
sabbath
in
thy
rest
thy
glory
thy
joy
thy
sight
thyself
and
where
i
shall
live
as
long
without
reckoning
any
more
days
after
as
thy
son
and
thy
holy
spirit
lived
with
thee
before
you
three
made
any
days
in
the
creation
xiv
prayer
o
eternal
and
most
gracious
god
who
though
thou
didst
permit
darkness
to
be
before
light
in
the
creation
yet
in
the
making
of
light
didst
so
multiply
that
light
as
that
it
enlightened
not
the
day
only
but
the
night
too
though
thou
have
suffered
some
dimness
some
clouds
of
sadness
and
disconsolateness
to
shed
themselves
upon
my
soul
i
humbly
bless
and
thankfully
glorify
thy
holy
name
that
thou
hast
afforded
me
the
light
of
thy
spirit
against
which
the
prince
of
darkness
can
not
prevail
nor
hinder
his
illumination
of
our
darkest
nights
of
our
saddest
thoughts
even
the
visitation
of
thy
most
blessed
spirit
upon
the
blessed
virgin
is
called
an
overshadowing
there
was
the
presence
of
the
holy
ghost
the
fountain
of
all
light
and
yet
an
overshadowing
nay
except
there
were
some
light
there
could
be
no
shadow
let
thy
merciful
providence
so
govern
all
in
this
sickness
that
i
never
fall
into
utter
darkness
ignorance
of
thee
or
inconsideration
of
myself
and
let
those
shadows
which
do
fall
upon
me
faintnesses
of
spirit
and
condemnations
of
myself
be
overcome
by
the
power
of
thine
irresistible
light
the
god
of
consolation
that
when
those
shadows
have
done
their
office
upon
me
to
let
me
see
that
of
myself
i
should
fall
into
irrecoverable
darkness
thy
spirit
may
do
his
office
upon
those
shadows
and
disperse
them
and
establish
me
in
so
bright
a
day
here
as
may
be
a
critical
day
to
me
a
day
wherein
and
whereby
i
may
give
thy
judgment
upon
myself
and
that
the
words
of
thy

spoken
to
his

natural
men
have
conceived
a
twofold
use
of
sleep
that
it
is
a
refreshing
of
the
body
in
this
life
that
it
is
a
preparing
of
the
soul
for
the
next
that
it
is
a
feast
and
it
is
the
grace
at
that
feast
that
it
is
our
recreation
and
cheers
us
and
it
is
our
catechism
and
instructs
us
we
lie
down
in
a
hope
that
we
shall
rise
the
stronger
and
we
lie
down
in
a
knowledge
that
we
may
rise
no
more
sleep
is
an
opiate
which
gives
us
rest
but
such
an
opiate
as
perchance
being
under
it
we
shall
wake
no
more
but
though
natural
men
who
have
induced
secondary
and
figurative
considerations
have
found
out
this
second
this
emblematical
use
of
sleep
that
it
should
be
a
representation
of
death
god
who
wrought
and
perfected
his
work
before
nature
began
for
nature
was
but
his
apprentice
to
learn
in
the
first
seven
days
and
now
is
his
foreman
and
works
next
under

god
i
say
intended
sleep
only
for
the
refreshing
of
man
by
bodily
rest
and
not
for
a
figure
of
death
for
he
intended
not
death
itself
then
but
man
having
induced
death
upon
himself
god
hath
taken
man
creature
death
into
his
hand
and
mended
it
and
whereas
it
hath
in
itself
a
fearful
form
and
aspect
so
that
man
is
afraid
of
his
own
creature
god
presents
it
to
him
in
a
familiar
in
an
assiduous
in
an
agreeable
and
acceptable
form
in
sleep
that
so
when
he
awakes
from
sleep
and
says
to
himself
shall
i
be
no
otherwise
when
i
am
dead
than
i
was
even
now
when
i
was
asleep
he
may
be
ashamed
of
his
waking
dreams
and
of
his
melancholy
fancying
out
a
horrid
and
an
affrightful
figure
of
that
death
which
is
so
like
sleep
as
then
we
need
sleep
to
live
out
our
threescore
and
ten
years
so
we
need
death
to
live
that
life
which
we
can
not
outlive
and
as
death
being
our
enemy
god
allows
us
to
defend
ourselves
against
it
for
we
victual
ourselves
against
death
twice
every
day
as
often
as
we
eat
so
god
having
so
sweetened
death
unto
us
as

hath

we
put

as
sleep
is
death
and
sleep
is
as
much
death
as
meat
is
life
this
then
is
the
misery
of
my
sickness
that
death
as
it
is
produced
from
me
and
is
mine
own
creature
is
now
before
mine
eyes
but
in
that
form
in
which
god
hath
mollified
it
to
us
and
made
it
acceptable
in
sleep
i
can
not
see
it
how
many
prisoners
who
have
even
hollowed
themselves
their
graves
upon
that
earth
on
which
they
have
lain
long
under
heavy
fetters
yet
at
this
hour
are
asleep
though
they
be
yet
working
upon
their
own
graves
by
their
own
weight
he
that
hath
seen
his
friend
die
or
knows
he
shall
see
it
yet
will
sink
into
a
sleep
between
i
can
not
and
oh
if
i
be
entering
now
into
eternity
where
there
shall
be
no
more
distinction
of
hours
why
is
it
all
my
business
now
to
tell
clocks
why
is
none
of
the
heaviness
of
my
heart
dispensed
into
mine
that
they
might
fall
as
my
heart
doth
and
why
since
i
have
lost
my
delight
in
all
objects
can
not
i
discontinue
the
faculty
of
seeing
them
by
closing
mine
eyes
in
sleep
but
why
rather
being
entering
into
that
presence
where
i
shall
wake
continually
and
never
sleep
more
do
i
not
interpret
my
continual
waking
here
to
be
a
parasceve
and
a
preparation
to
that
xv
expostulation
my
god
my
god
i
know
for
thou
hast
said
it
that
that
keepeth
israel
shall
neither
slumber
nor
but
shall
not
that
israel
over
whom
thou
watchest
sleep
i
know
for
thou
hast
said
it
that
there
are
men
whose
damnation
sleepeth
not
but
shall
not
they
to
whom
thou
art
salvation
sleep
or
wilt
thou
take
from
them
that
evidence
and
that
testimony
that
they
are
thy
israel
or
thou
their
salvation
givest
thy
beloved
shall
i
lack
that
seal
of
thy
love
shall
lie
down
and
none
shall
make
you
shall
i
be
outlawed
from
that
protection
jonah
slept
in
one
dangerous
storm
and
thy
blessed
son
in
another
shall
i
have
no
use
no
benefit
no
application
of
those
great
examples
if
he
sleep
he
shall
do
say
thy
son
disciples
to
him
of
lazarus
and
shall
there
be
no
room
for
that
argument
in
me
or
shall
i
be
open
to
the
contrary
if
i
sleep
not
shall
i
not
be
well
in
their
sense
let
me
not
o
my
god
take
this
too
precisely
too
literally
is
that
neither
day
nor
night
seeth
sleep
with
his
says
thy
wise
servant
solomon
and
whether
he
speak
that
of
worldly
men
or
of
men
that
seek
wisdom
whether
in
justification
or
condemnation
of
their
watchfulness
we
can
not
tell
we
can
tell
that
there
are
men
that
can
not
sleep
till
they
have
done
mischief
and
then
they
can
and
we
can
tell
that
the
rich
man
can
not
sleep
because
his
abundance
will
not
let
him
the
tares
were
sown
when
the
husbandmen
were
asleep
and
the
elders
thought
it
a
probable
excuse
a
credible
lie
that
the
watchmen
which
kept
the
sepulchre
should
say
that
the
body
of
thy
son
was
stolen
away
when
they
were
asleep
since
thy
blessed
son
rebuked
his
disciples
for
sleeping
shall
i
murmur
because
i
do
not
sleep
if
samson
had
slept
any
longer
in
gaza
he
had
been
taken
and
when
he
did
sleep
longer
with
delilah
he
was
taken
sleep
is
as
often
taken
for
natural
death
in
thy
scriptures
as
for
natural
rest
nay
sometimes
sleep
hath
so
heavy
a
sense
as
to
be
taken
for
sin
itself
as
well
as
for
the
punishment
of
sin
death
much
comfort
is
not
in
much
sleep
when
the
most
fearful
and
most
irrevocable
malediction
is
presented
by
thee
in
a
perpetual
sleep
will
make
their
feasts
and
i
will
make
them
drunk
and
they
shall
sleep
a
perpetual
sleep
and
not
i
must
therefore
o
my
god
look
farther
than
into
the
very
act
of
sleeping
before
i
misinterpret
my
waking
for
since
i
find
thy
whole
hand
light
shall
any
finger
of
that
hand
seem
heavy
since
the
whole
sickness
is
thy
physic
shall
any
accident
in
it
be
my
poison
by
my
murmuring
the
name
of
watchmen
belongs
to
our
profession
thy
prophets
are
not
only
seers
endued
with
a
power
of
seeing
able
to
see
but
watchmen
evermore
in
the
act
of
seeing
and
therefore
give
me
leave
o
my
blessed
god
to
invert
the
words
of
thy
son
spouse
she
said
sleep
but
my
heart
i
say
i
wake
but
my
heart
sleepeth
my
body
is
in
a
sick
weariness
but
my
soul
in
a
peaceful
rest
with
thee
and
as
our
eyes
in
our
health
see
not
the
air
that
is
next
them
nor
the
fire
nor
the
spheres
nor
stop
upon
any
thing
till
they
come
to
stars
so
my
eyes
that
are
open
see
nothing
of
this
world
but
pass
through
all
that
and
fix
themselves
upon
thy
peace
and
joy
and
glory
above
almost
as
soon
as
thy
apostle
had
said
us
not
lest
we
should
be
too
much
discomforted
if
we
did
he
says
again
we
wake
or
sleep
let
us
live
together
with
though
then
this
absence
of
sleep
may
argue
the
presence
of
death
the
original
may
exclude
the
copy
the
life
the
picture
yet
this
gentle
sleep
and
rest
of
my
soul
betroths
me
to
thee
to
whom
i
shall
be
married
indissolubly
though
by
this
way
of
dissolution
xv
prayer
o
eternal
and
most
gracious
god
who
art
able
to
make
and
dost
make
the
sick
bed
of
thy
servants
chapels
of
ease
to
them
and
the
dreams
of
thy
servants
prayers
and
meditations
upon
thee
let
not
this
continual
watchfulness
of
mine
this
inability
to
sleep
which
thou
hast
laid
upon
me
be
any
disquiet
or
discomfort
to
me
but
rather
an
argument
that
thou
wouldst
not
have
me
sleep
in
thy
presence
what
it
may
indicate
or
signify
concerning
the
state
of
my
body
let
them
consider
to
whom
that
consideration
belongs
do
thou
who
only
art
the
physician
of
my
soul
tell
her
that
thou
wilt
afford
her
such
defensatives
as
that
she
shall
wake
ever
towards
thee
and
yet
ever
sleep
in
thee
and
that
through
all
this
sickness
thou
wilt
either
preserve
mine
understanding
from
all
decays
and
distractions
which
these
watchings
might
occasion
or
that
thou
wilt
reckon
and
account
with
me
from
before
those
violences
and
not
call
any
piece
of
my
sickness
a
sin
it
is
a
heavy
and
indelible
sin
that
i
brought
into
the
world
with
me
it
is
a
heavy
and
innumerable
multitude
of
sins
which
i
have
heaped
up
since
i
have
sinned
behind
thy
back
if
that
can
be
done
by
wilful
abstaining
from
thy
congregations
and
omitting
thy
service
and
i
have
sinned
before
thy
face
in
my
hypocrisies
in
prayer
in
my
ostentation
and
the
mingling
a
respect
of
myself
in
preaching
thy
word
i
have
sinned
in
my
fasting
by
repining
when
a
penurious
fortune
hath
kept
me
low
and
i
have
sinned
even
in
that
fulness
when
i
have
been
at
thy
table
by
a
negligent
examination
by
a
wilful
prevarication
in
receiving
that
heavenly
food
and
physic
but
as
i
know
o
my
gracious
god
that
for
all
those
sins
committed
since
yet
thou
wilt
consider
me
as
i
was
in
thy
purpose
when
thou
wrotest
my
name
in
the
book
of
life
in
mine
election
so
into
what
deviations
soever
i
stray
and
wander
by
occasion
of
this
sickness
o
god
return
thou
to
that
minute
wherein
thou
wast
pleased
with
me
and
consider
me
in
that
condition

meditation
we
have
a
convenient
author
who
writ
a
discourse
of
bells
when
he
was
prisoner
in
turkey
how
would
he
have
enlarged
himself
if
he
had
been
my
in
this
sick
bed
so
near
to
that
steeple
which
never
ceases
no
more
than
the
harmony
of
the
spheres
but
is
more
heard
when
the
turks
took
constantinople
they
melted
the
bells
into
ordnance
i
have
heard
both
bells
and
ordnance
but
never
been
so
much
affected
with
those
as
with
these
bells
i
have
lain
near
a
steeple
in
which
there
are
said
to
be
more
than
thirty
bells
and
near
another
where
there
is
one
so
big
as
that
the
clapper
is
said
to
weigh
more
than
six
hundred
pounds
yet
never
so
affected
as
here
here
the
bells
can
scarce
solemnize
the
funeral
of
any
person
but
that
i
knew
him
or
knew
that
he
was
my
neighbour
we
dwelt
in
houses
near
to
one
another
before
but
now
he
is
gone
into
that
house
into
which
i
must
follow
him
there
is
a
way
of
correcting
the
children
of
great
persons
that
other
children
are
corrected
in
their
behalf
and
in
their
names
and
this
works
upon
them
who
indeed
had
more
deserved
it
and
when
these
bells
tell
me
that
now
one
and
now
another
is
buried
must
not
i
acknowledge
that
they
have
the
correction
due
to
me
and
paid
the
debt
that
i
owe
there
is
a
story
of
a
bell
in
a
monastery
which
when
any
of
the
house
was
sick
to
death
rung
always
voluntarily
and
they
knew
the
inevitableness
of
the
danger
by
that
it
rung
once
when
no
man
was
sick
but
the
next
day
one
of
the
house
fell
from
the
steeple
and
died
and
the
bell
held
the
reputation
of
a
prophet
still
if
these
bells
that
warn
to
a
funeral
now
were
appropriated
to
none
may
not
i
by
the
hour
of
the
funeral
supply
how
many
men
that
stand
at
an
execution
if
they
would
ask
for
what
dies
that
man
should
hear
their
own
faults
condemned
and
see
themselves
executed
by
attorney
we
scarce
hear
of
any
man
preferred
but
we
think
of
ourselves
that
we
might
very
well
have
been
that
man
why
might
not
i
have
been
that
man
that
is
carried
to
his
grave
now
could
i
fit
myself
to
stand
or
sit
in
any
man
place
and
not
to
lie
in
any
man
grave
i
may
lack
much
of
the
good
parts
of
the
meanest
but
i
lack
nothing
of
the
mortality
of
the
weakest
they
may
have
acquired
better
abilities
than
i
but
i
was
born
to
as
many
infirmities
as
they
to
be
an
incumbent
by
lying
down
in
a
grave
to
be
a
doctor
by
teaching
mortification
by
example
by
dying
though
i
may
have
seniors
others
may
be
older
than
i
yet
i
have
proceeded
apace
in
a
good
university
and
gone
a
great
way
in
a
little
time
by
the
furtherance
of
a
vehement
fever
and
whomsoever
these
bells
bring
to
the
ground
if
he
and
i
had
been
compared
yesterday
perchance
i
should
have
been
thought
likelier
to
come
to
this
preferment
then
than
he
god
hath
kept
the
power
of
death
in
his
own
hands
lest
any
man
should
bribe
death
if
man
knew
the
gain
of
death
the
ease
of
death
he
would
solicit
he
would
provoke
death
to
assist
him
by
any
hand
which
he
might
use
but
as
when
men
see
many
of
their
own
professions
preferred
it
ministers
a
hope
that
that
may
light
upon
them
so
when
these
hourly
bells
tell
me
of
so
many
funerals
of
men
like
me
it
presents
if
not
a
desire
that
it
may
yet
a
comfort
whensoever
mine
shall
come
xvi
expostulation
my
god
my
god
i
do
not
expostulate
with
thee
but
with
them
who
dare
do
that
who
dare
expostulate
with
thee
when
in
the
voice
of
thy
church
thou
givest
allowance
to
this
ceremony
of
bells
at
funerals
is
it
enough
to
refuse
it
because
it
was
in
use
among
the
gentiles
so
were
funerals
too
is
it
because
some
abuses
may
have
crept
in
amongst
christians
is
that
enough
that
their
ringing
hath
been
said
to
drive
away
evil
spirits
truly
that
is
so
far
true
as
that
the
evil
spirit
is
vehemently
vexed
in
their
ringing
therefore
because
that
action
brings
the
congregation
together
and
unites
god
and
his
people
to
the
destruction
of
that
kingdom
which
the
evil
spirit
usurps
in
the
first
institution
of
thy
church
in
this
world
in
the
foundation
of
thy
militant
church
amongst
the
jews
thou
didst
appoint
the
calling
of
the
assembly
in
to
be
by
trumpet
and
when
they
were
in
then
thou
gavest
them
the
sound
of
bells
in
the
garment
of
thy
priest
in
the
triumphant
church
thou
employest
both
too
but
in
an
inverted
order
we
enter
into
the
triumphant
church
by
the
sound
of
bells
for
we
enter
when
we
die
and
then
we
receive
our
further
edification
or
consummation
by
the
sound
of
trumpets
at
the
resurrection
the
sound
of
thy
trumpets
thou
didst
impart
to
secular
and
civil
uses
too
but
the
sound
of
bells
only
to
sacred
lord
let
not
us
break
the
communion
of
saints
in
that
which
was
intended
for
the
advancement
of
it
let
not
that
pull
us
asunder
from
one
another
which
was
intended
for
the
assembling
of
us
in
the
militant
and
associating
of
us
to
the
triumphant
church
but
he
for
whose
funeral
these
bells
ring
now
was
at
home
at
his
journey
end
yesterday
why
ring
they
now
a
man
that
is
a
world
is
all
the
things
in
the
world
he
is
an
army
and
when
an
army
marches
the
van
may
lodge
where
the
rear
comes
not
till
a
man
extends
to
his
act
and
to
his
example
to
that
which
he
does
and
that
which
he
teaches
so
do
those
things
that
concern
him
so
do
these
bells
that
which
rung
yesterday
was
to
convey
him
out
of
the
world
in
his
van
in
his
soul
that
which
rung
was
to
bring
him
in
his
rear
in
his
body
to
the
church
and
this
continuing
of
ringing
after
his
entering
is
to
bring
him
to
me
in
the
application
where
i
lie
i
could
hear
the
psalm
and
did
join
with
the
congregation
in
it
but
i
could
not
hear
the
sermon
and
these
latter
bells
are
a
repetition
sermon
to
me
but
o
my
god
my
god
do
i
that
have
this
fever
need
other
remembrances
of
my
mortality
is
not
mine
own
hollow
voice
voice
enough
to
pronounce
that
to
me
need
i
look
upon
a
death
head
in
a
ring
that
have
one
in
my
face
or
go
for
death
to
my
neighbour
house
that
have
him
in
my
bosom
we
can
not
we
can
not
o
my
god
take
in
too
many
helps
for
religious
duties
i
know
i
can
not
have
any
better
image
of
thee
than
thy
son
nor
any
better
image
of
him
than
his
gospel
yet
must
not
i
with
thanks
confess
to
thee
that
some
historical
pictures
of
his
have
sometimes
put
me
upon
better
meditations
than
otherwise
i
should
have
fallen
upon
i
know
thy
church
needed
not
to
have
taken
in
from
jew
or
gentile
any
supplies
for
the
exaltation
of
thy
glory
or
our
devotion
of
absolute
necessity
i
know
she
needed
not
but
yet
we
owe
thee
our
thanks
that
thou
hast
given
her
leave
to
do
so
and
that
as
in
making
us
christians
thou
didst
not
destroy
that
which
we
were
before
natural
men
so
in
the
exalting
of
our
religious
devotions
now
we
are
christians
thou
hast
been
pleased
to
continue
to

prayer
o
eternal
and
most
gracious
god
who
having
consecrated
our
living
bodies
to
thine
own
spirit
and
made
us
temples
of
the
holy
ghost
dost
also
require
a
respect
to
be
given
to
these
temples
even
when
the
priest
is
gone
out
of
them
to
these
bodies
when
the
soul
is
departed
from
them
i
bless
and
glorify
thy
name
that
as
thou
takest
care
in
our
life
of
every
hair
of
our
head
so
dost
thou
also
of
every
grain
of
ashes
after
our
death
neither
dost
thou
only
do
good
to
us
all
in
life
and
death
but
also
wouldst
have
us
do
good
to
one
another
as
in
a
holy
life
so
in
those
things
which
accompany
our
death
in
that
contemplation
i
make
account
that
i
hear
this
dead
brother
of
ours
who
is
now
carried
out
to
his
burial
to
speak
to
me
and
to
preach
my
funeral
sermon
in
the
voice
of
these
bells
in
him
o
god
thou
hast
accomplished
to
me
even
the
request
of
dives
to
abraham
thou
hast
sent
one
from
the
dead
to
speak
unto
me
he
speaks
to
me
aloud
from
that
steeple
he
whispers
to
me
at
these
curtains
and
he
speaks
thy
words
are
the
dead
which
die
in
the
lord
from
let
this
prayer
therefore
o
my
god
be
as
my
last
gasp
my
expiring
my
dying
in
thee
that
if
this
be
the
hour
of
my
transmigration
i
may
die
the
death
of
a
sinner
drowned
in
my
sins
in
the
blood
of
thy
son
and
if
i
live
longer
yet
i
may
now
die
the
death
of
the
righteous
die
to
sin
which
death
is
a
resurrection
to
a
new
life
killest
and
thou
givest
whichsoever
comes
it
comes
from
thee
which
way
soever
it
comes
let
me
come
to
thee

this

calls
us
all

how
much
more
me
who
am
brought
so

by

there
was
a

both
piety

dignity
religion
and
estimation
were
mingled
which
of
the
religious
orders
should
ring
to
prayers
first
in
the
morning
and
it
was
determined
that
they
should
ring
first
that
rose
earliest
if
we
understand
aright
the
dignity
of
this
bell
that
tolls
for
our

we
would
be
glad
to
make
it
ours
by
rising
early
in
that
application
that
it
might
be
ours
as
well
as
his

indeed
it
is
the

toll

him
that
thinks
it
doth
and
though
it
intermit
again
yet
from
that
minute
that
that
occasion
wrought
upon
him
he
is
united
to
god
who
casts
not
up
his
eye
to
the
sun
when
it
rises
but
who
takes
off
his
eye
from
a
comet
when
that
breaks
out
who
bends
not
his

to
any
bell
which
upon
any
occasion
rings

who
can
remove
it

this

digs
out
and

that
gold

me

by

i

expostulation
my

my

is
this

of
thy

of
drawing
light
out
of
darkness
to
make
him
for
whom
this

tolls
now
in
this
dimness
of
his
sight
to
become
a
superintendent
an
overseer
a
bishop
to
as
many
as
hear
his
voice
in
this
bell
and
to
give
us
a
confirmation
in
this
action
is
this
one
of
thy
ways
to
raise
strength
out
of
weakness
to
make
him
who
can
not
rise
from
his
bed
nor
stir
in
his
bed
come
home
to
me
and
in
this
sound
give
me
the
strength
of
healthy
and
vigorous
instructions
o
my
god
my
god
what
thunder
is
not
a
cymbal
what
hoarseness
what
harshness
is
not
a
clear
organ
if
thou
be
pleased
to
set
thy
voice
to
it
and
what
organ
is
not
well
played
on
if
thy
hand
be
upon
it
thy
voice
thy
hand
is
in
this
sound
and
in
this
one
sound
i
hear
this
whole
concert
i
hear
thy
jacob
call
unto
his
sons
and
say
yourselves
together
that
i
may
tell
you
what
shall
befall
you
in
the

which

i

telling

all
within

of
this

the
blessing
wherewith
i
bless
you
before
my
this
that
before
your

you
would
consider
your
own
in

prophet
saying
to
hezekiah
thy
house
in
order
for
thou
shalt
die
and
not
he
makes
use
of
his
family
and
calls
this
a
setting
of
his
house
in
order
to
compose
us
to
the
meditation
of
death
i
hear
thy
apostle
saying
think
it
meet
to
put
you
in
remembrance
knowing
that
shortly
i
must
go
out
of
this
this
is
the
publishing
of
his

and
this

is
our
legacy
the
applying
of
his
present
condition
to
our
use
i
hear
that
which
makes
all
sounds
music
and
all
music
perfect
i
hear
thy
son
himself
saying
not
your
hearts
be

i
hear
this
change
that
whereas
thy
son
says
there
go
to
prepare
a
place
for
this
man
in
this

says
i
send
to
prepare
you
for
a

o

heaven
is
glory

do
not
glorious

joyful
things
lead
us

us
to

thy
legacies
in
thy

in
the

plenty

victory
wine
and
oil
milk
and
honey
alliances
of
friends

peaceful
hearts

cheerful
countenances

by
these
galleries
thou
broughtest
them
into
thy
bedchamber
by
these
glories
and
joys
to
the
joys
and
glories
of
heaven
why
hast
thou
changed
thine
old
way
and
carried
us
by
the
ways
of
discipline
and
mortification
by
the
ways
of
mourning
and
lamentation
by
the
ways
of
miserable
ends
and
miserable
anticipations
of
those
miseries
in
appropriating
the
exemplar
miseries
of
others
to
ourselves
and
usurping
upon
their
miseries
as
our
own
to
our
prejudice
is
the
glory
of
heaven
no
perfecter
in
itself
but
that
it
needs
a
foil
of
depression
and
ingloriousness
in
this
world
to
set
it
off
is
the
joy
of
heaven
no
perfecter
in
itself
but
that
it
needs
the
sourness
of
this
life
to
give
it
a
taste
is
that
joy
and
that
glory
but
a
comparative
glory
and
a
comparative
joy
not
such
in
itself
but
such
in
comparison
of
the
joylessness
and
the
ingloriousness
of
this
world
i
know
my
god
it
is
far
far
otherwise
as
thou
thyself
who
art
all
art
made

so
the
joys

which
are

thee
are
made

none

why
then
my

thou
not

here
pardon

rashness

that

who

of
thy

i
humbly
accept
thy

in
the
sound
of
this
sad
and
funeral
bell
and
first
i
bless
thy
glorious
name
that
in
this
sound

i
can
hear
thy

in
another

to
consider
mine
own

and
to
know
that
this
bell
which
tolls
for
another
before
it
come
to
ring
out
may
take
me
in
too
as
death
is
the
wages
of
sin
it
is
due

me
as
death
is
the
end
of

it

though
so
disobedient
a

as
i
may
be
afraid

to
so
merciful
a
master
as
thou
i
can
not
be

therefore
into
thy

o
my

i
commend

i

being

prepared

conformed
to

having
received
thy

asking
no

i
am
bold
o

to
bend
my
prayers
to
thee
for
his
assistance
the

of
whose

hath
called
me
to
this

lay
hold
upon
his
soul
o
god
till
that
soul
have
thoroughly
considered
his
account
and
how
few
minutes
soever
it
have
to
remain
in
that
body
let
the
power
of
thy
spirit
recompense
the
shortness
of
time
and
perfect
his
account
before
he
pass
away
present
his
sins
so
to
him
as
that
he
may
know
what
thou
forgivest
and
not
doubt
of
thy
forgiveness
let
him
stop
upon
the
infiniteness
of
those
sins
but
dwell
upon
the
infiniteness
of
thy
mercy
let
him
discern
his
own
demerits
but
wrap
himself
up
in
the
merits
of
thy
son
christ
jesus
breathe
inward
comforts
to
his

afford
him
the
power
of
giving
such
outward
testimonies
thereof
as
all
that
are
about
him
may
derive
comforts
from
thence
and
have
this
edification
even
in
this
dissolution
that
though
the
body
be
going
the
way
of
all
flesh
yet
that
soul

going

way

and
procreation
from
parents
because
they
think
it
hard
to
charge
the
soul
with
the
guiltiness
of
original
sin
if
the
soul
were
infused
into
a
body
in
which
it
must
necessarily
grow
foul
and
contract
original
sin
whether
it
will
or
no
and
i
shall
find
some
that
will
tell
me
that
it
is
by
immediate
infusion
from
god
because
they
think
it
hard
to
maintain
an
immortality
in
such
a
soul
as
should
be
begotten
and
derived
with
the
body
from
mortal
parents
if
i
will
ask
not
a
few
men
but
almost
whole
bodies
whole
churches
what
becomes
of
the
souls
of
the
righteous
at
the
departing
thereof
from
the
body
i
shall
be
told
by
some
that
they
attend
an
expiation
a
purification
in
a
place
of
torment
by
some
that
they
attend
the
fruition
of
the
sight
of
god
in
a
place
of
rest
but
yet
but
of
expectation
by
some
that
they
pass
to
an
immediate
possession
of
the
presence
of
god
augustine
studied
the
nature
of
the
soul
as
much
as
any
thing
but
the
salvation
of
the
soul
and
he
sent
an
express
messenger
to
hierome
to
consult
of
some
things
concerning
the
soul
but
he
satisfies
himself
with
this
let
the
departure
of
my
soul
to
salvation
be
evident
to
my
faith
and
i
care
the
less
how
dark
the
entrance
of
my
soul
into
my
body
be
to
my
reason
it
is
the
going
out
more
than
the
coming
in
that
concerns
us
this
soul
this
bell
tells
me
is
gone
out
whither
who
shall
tell
me
that
i
know
not
who
it
is
much
less
what
he
was
the
condition
of
the
man
and
the
course
of
his
life
which
should
tell
me
whither
he
is
gone
i
know
not
i
was
not
there
in
his
sickness
nor
at
his
death
i
saw
not
his
way
nor
his
end
nor
can
ask
them
who
did
thereby
to
conclude
or
argue
whither
he
is
gone
but
yet
i
have
one
nearer
me
than
all
these
mine
own
charity
i
ask
that
and
that
tells
me
he
is
gone
to
everlasting
rest
and
joy
and
glory
i
owe
him
a
good
opinion
it
is
but
thankful
charity
in
me
because
i
received
benefit
and
instruction
from
him
when
his
bell
tolled
and
i
being
made
the
fitter
to
pray
by
that
disposition
wherein
i
was
assisted
by
his
occasion
did
pray
for
him
and
i
pray
not
without
faith
so
i
do
charitably
so
i
do
faithfully
believe
that
that
soul
is
gone
to
everlasting
rest
and
joy
and
glory
but
for
the
body
how
poor
a
wretched
thing
is
that
we
can
not
express
it
so
fast
as
it
grows
worse
and
worse
that
body
which
scarce
three
minutes
since
was
such
a
house
as
that
that
soul
which
made
but
one
step
from
thence
to
heaven
was
scarce
thoroughly
content
to
leave
that
for
heaven
that
body
hath
lost
the
name
of
a
because
none
dwells
in
it
and
is
making
haste
to
lose
the
name
of
a
body
and
dissolve
to
putrefaction
who
would
not
be
affected
to
see
a
clear
and
sweet
river
in
the
morning
grow
a
kennel
of
muddy
by
noon
and
condemned
to
the
saltness
of
the
sea
by
night
and
how
lame
a
picture
how
faint
a
representation
is
that
of
the
precipitation
of
man
body
to
dissolution
now
all
the
parts
built
up
and
knit
by
a
lovely
soul
now
but
a
statue
of
clay
and
now
these
limbs
melted
off
as
if
that
clay
were
but
snow
and
now
the
whole
house
is
but
a
handful
of
sand
so
much
dust
and
but
a
peck
of
rubbish
so
much
bone
if
he
who
as
this
bell
tells
me
is
gone
now
were
some
excellent
artificer
who
comes
to
him
for
a
cloak
or
for
a
garment
now
or
for
counsel
if
he
were
a
lawyer
if
a
magistrate
for
justice
man
before
he
hath
his
immortal
soul
hath
a
soul
of
sense
and
a
soul
of
vegetation
before
that
this
immortal
soul
did
not
forbid
other
souls
to
be
in
us
before
but
when
this
soul
departs
it
carries
all
with
it
no
more
vegetation
no
more
sense
such
a
is
the
earth
in
respect
of
our
natural
mother
in
her
womb
we
grew
and
when
she
was
delivered
of
us
we
were
planted
in
some
place
in
some
calling
in
the
world
in
the
womb
of
the
earth
we
diminish
and
when
she
is
delivered
of
us
our
grave
opened
for
another
we
are
not
transplanted
but
transported
our
dust
blown
away
with
profane
dust
with
every
wind
xviii
expostulation
my
god
my
god
if
expostulation
be
too
bold
a
word
do
thou
mollify
it
with
another
let
it
be
wonder
in
myself
let
it
be
but
problem
to
others
but
let
me
ask
why
wouldst
thou
not
suffer
those
that
serve
thee
in
holy
services
to
do
any
office
about
the
dead
nor
assist
at
their
funeral
thou
hadst
no
counsellor
thou
needst
none
thou
hast
no
controller
thou
admittedst
none
why
do
i
ask
in
ceremonial
things
as
that
was
any
convenient
reason
is
enough
who
can
be
sure
to
propose
that
reason
that
moved
thee
in
the
institution
thereof
i
satisfy
myself
with
this
that
in
those
times
the
gentiles
were
of
an
respect
to
the
memory
of
the
dead
a
great
part
of
the
idolatry
of
the
nations
flowed
from
that
an
devotion
an
celebrating
and
preserving
of
the
memories
and
the
pictures
of
some
dead
persons
and
by
vain
glory
of
men
they
entered
into
the
and
their
statues
and
pictures
contracted
an
opinion
of
divinity
by
age
that
which
was
at
first
but
a
picture
of
a
friend
grew
a
god
in
time
as
the
wise
man
notes
called
them
gods
which
were
the
work
of
an
ancient
and
some
have
assigned
a
certain
time
when
a
picture
should
come
out
of
minority
and
be
at
age
to
be
a
god
in
sixty
years
after
it
is
made
those
images
of
men
that
had
life
and
some
idols
of
other
things
which
never
had
any
being
are
by
one
common
name
called
promiscuously
dead
and
for
that
the
wise
man
reprehends
the
idolater
health
he
prays
to
that
which
is
weak
and
for
life
he
prays
to
that
which
is
should
we
do
so
says
thy
prophet
we
go
from
the
living
to
the
dead
so
much
ill
then
being
occasioned
by
so
much
religious
compliment
exhibited
to
the
dead
thou
o
god
i
think
wouldst
therefore
inhibit
thy
principal
holy
servants
from
contributing
any
thing
at
all
to
this
dangerous
intimation
of
idolatry
and
that
the
people
might
say
surely
those
dead
men
are
not
so
much
to
be
magnified
as
men
mistake
since
god
will
not
suffer
his
holy
officers
so
much
as
to
touch
them
not
to
see
them
but
those
dangers
being
removed
thou
o
my
god
dost
certainly
allow
that
we
should
do
offices
of
piety
to
the
dead
and
that
we
should
draw
instructions
to
piety
from
the
dead
is
not
this
o
my
god
a
holy
kind
of
raising
up
seed
to
my
dead
brother
if
i
by
the
meditation
of
his
death
produce
a
better
life
in
myself
it
is
the
blessing
upon
reuben
reuben
live
and
not
die
and
let
not
his
men
be
let
him
propagate
many
and
it
is
a
malediction
that
dieth
let
it
let
it
do
no
good
in
dying
for
without
thou
by
thy
apostle
callest
it
is
a
second
death
if
none
live
the
better
by
me
after
my
death
by
the
manner
of
my
death
therefore
may
i
justly
think
that
thou
madest
that
a
way
to
convey
to
the
egyptians
a
fear
of
thee
and
a
fear
of
death
that
was
not
a
house
where
there
was
not
one
for
thereupon
the
egyptians
said
are
all
dead
the
death
of
others
should
catechise
us
to
death
thy
son
christ
jesus
is
the
begotten
of
the
he
rises
first
the
eldest
brother
and
he
is
my
master
in
this
science
of
death
but
yet
for
me
i
am
a
younger
brother
too
to
this
man
who
died
now
and
to
every
man
whom
i
see
or
hear
to
die
before
me
and
all
they
are
ushers
to
me
in
this
school
of
death
i
take
therefore
that
which
thy
servant
david
wife
said
to
him
to
be
said
to
me
thou
save
not
thy
life
thou
shalt
be
if
the
death
of
this
man
work
not
upon
me
now
i
shall
die
worse
than
if
thou
hadst
not
afforded
me
this
help
for
thou
hast
sent
him
in
this
bell
to
me
as
thou
didst
send
to
the
angel
of
sardis
with
commission
to
the
things
that
remain
and
that
are
ready
to
that
in
this
weakness
of
body
i
might
receive
spiritual
strength
by
these
occasions
this
is
my
strength
that
whether
thou
say
to
me
as
thine
angel
said
to
gideon
be
unto
thee
fear
not
thou
shalt
not
or
whether
thou
say
as
unto
aaron
shalt
die
yet
thou
wilt
preserve
that
which
is
ready
to
die
my
soul
from
the
worst
death
that
of
sin
zimri
for
his
says
thy
spirit
he
sinned
in
doing
evil
and
in
his
sin
which
he
did
to
make
israel
for
his
sins
his
many
sins
and
then
in
his
sin
his
particular
sin
for
my
sins
i
shall
die
whensoever
i
die
for
death
is
the
wages
of
sin
but
i
shall
die
in
my
sin
in
that
particular
sin
of
resisting
thy
spirit
if
i
apply
not
thy
assistances
doth
it
not
call
us
to
a
particular
consideration
that
thy
blessed
son
varies
his
form
of
commination
and
aggravates
it
in
the
variation
when
he
says
to
the
jews
because
they
refused
the
light
offered
shall
die
in
your
and
then
when
they
proceeded
to
farther
disputations
and
vexations
and
temptations
he
adds
shall
die
in
your
he
multiplies
the
former
expression
to
a
plural
in
this
sin
and
in
all
your
sins
doth
not
the
resisting
of
thy
particular
helps
at
last
draw
upon
us
the
guiltiness
of
all
our
former
sins
may
not
the
neglecting
of
this
sound
ministered
to
me
in

bring
me
to
that
misery
so
that
i
whom
the
lord
of

loved
so
as
to
die

die

prayer
o
eternal
and
most
gracious
god
i
have
a
new
occasion
of
thanks
and
a
new
occasion
of
prayer
to
thee
from
the
ringing
of
this
bell
thou
toldest
me
in
the
other
voice
that
i
was
mortal
and
approaching
to
death
in
this
i
may
hear
thee
say
that
i
am
dead
in
an
irremediable
in
an
irrecoverable
state
for
bodily
health
if
that
be
thy
language
in
this
voice
how
infinitely
am
i
bound
to
thy
heavenly
majesty
for
speaking
so
plainly
unto
me
for
even
that
voice
that
i
must
die
now
is
not
the
voice
of
a
judge
that
speaks
by
way
of
condemnation
but
of
a
physician
that
presents
health
in
that
thou
presentest
me
death
as
the
cure
of
my
disease
not
as
the
exaltation
of
it

i
mistake
thy
voice
herein
if
i
overrun
thy
pace
and
prevent
thy
hand
and
imagine
death
more
instant
upon
me
than
thou
hast
bid
him
be

voice
belongs
to
me
i
am
dead
i
was
born
dead
and
from
the
first
laying
of
these
mud
walls
in
my
conception
they
have
mouldered
away

the
whole
course

life
is
but
an
active
death

instruct

or
remember
me
that
i

i

thee
also
to
accept
my
prayers
in
his

this

thee

inexpressible
happiness
there
yet
here
upon

thou
hast
given
us
such

consummation

with
it
may
soon

full
consummation

beg
at
thy
hand

merciful
god
for
thy

that
that
blessed

of
thine

have
the
consummation

well

loves
not

of

neither
there
are
of

they

about

comes

from
some
till

much
labour
and
some

give

before

that

must
lose
the

as

will
not

put
to

and
shall
we
look
for
this
indulgence
in
a
disease
or
think
to
shake
it
off
before
it
be
ripe
all
this
while
therefore
we
are
but
upon
a
defensive
war
and
that
is
but
a
doubtful
state
especially
where
they
who
are
besieged
do
know
the
best
of
their
defences
and
do
not
know
the
worst
of
their
enemy
power
when
they
can
not
mend
their
works
within
and
the
enemy
can
increase
his
numbers
without
o
how
many
far
more
miserable
and
far
more
worthy
to
be
less
miserable
than
i
are
besieged
with
this
sickness
and
lack
their
sentinels
their
physicians
to
watch
and
lack
their
munition
their
cordials
to
defend
and
perish
before
the
enemy
weakness
might
invite
them
to
sally
before
the
disease
show
any
declination
or
admit
any
way
of
working
upon
itself
in
me
the
siege
is
so
far
slackened
as
that
we
may
come
to
fight
and
so
die
in
the
field
if
i
die
and
not
in
a
prison
xix
expostulation
my
god
my
god
thou
art
a
direct
god
may
i
not
say
a
literal
god
a
god
that
wouldst
be
understood
literally
and
according
to
the
plain
sense
of
all
that
thou
sayest
but
thou
art
also
lord
i
intend
it
to
thy
glory
and
let
no
profane
misinterpreter
abuse
it
to
thy
diminution
thou
art
a
figurative
a
metaphorical
god
too
a
god
in
whose
words
there
is
such
a
height
of
figures
such
voyages
such
peregrinations
to
fetch
remote
and
precious
metaphors
such
extensions
such
spreadings
such
curtains
of
allegories
such
third
heavens
of
hyperboles
so
harmonious
elocutions
so
retired
and
so
reserved
expressions
so
commanding
persuasions
so
persuading
commandments
such
sinews
even
in
thy
milk
and
such
things
in
thy
words
as
all
profane
authors
seem
of
the
seed
of
the
serpent
that
creeps
thou
art
the
dove
that
flies
o
what
words
but
thine
can
express
the
inexpressible
texture
and
composition
of
thy
word
in
which
to
one
man
that
argument
that
binds
his
faith
to
believe
that
to
be
the
word
of
god
is
the
reverent
simplicity
of
the
word
and
to
another
the
majesty
of
the
word
and
in
which
two
men
equally
pious
may
meet
and
one
wonder
that
all
should
not
understand
it
and
the
other
as
much
that
any
man
should
so
lord
thou
givest
us
the
same
earth
to
labour
on
and
to
lie
in
a
house
and
a
grave
of
the
same
earth
so
lord
thou
givest
us
the
same
word
for
our
satisfaction
and
for
our
inquisition
for
our
instruction
and
for
our
admiration
too
for
there
are
places
that
thy
servants
hierom
and
augustine
would
scarce
believe
when
they
grew
warm
by
mutual
letters
of
one
another
that
they
understood
them
and
yet
both
hierom
and
augustine
call
upon
persons
whom
they
knew
to
be
far
weaker
than
they
thought
one
another
old
women
and
young
maids
to
read
the
scriptures
without
confining
them
to
these
or
those
places
neither
art
thou
thus
a
figurative
a
metaphorical
god
in
thy
word
only
but
in
thy
works
too
the
style
of
thy
works
the
phrase
of
thine
actions
is
metaphorical
the
institution
of
thy
whole
worship
in
the
old
law
was
a
continual
allegory
types
and
figures
overspread
all
and
figures
flowed
into
figures
and
poured
themselves
out
into
farther
figures
circumcision
carried
a
figure
of
baptism
and
baptism
carries
a
figure
of
that
purity
which
we
shall
have
in
perfection
in
the
new
jerusalem
neither
didst
thou
speak
and
work
in
this
language
only
in
the
time
of
thy
prophets
but
since
thou
spokest
in
thy
son
it
is
so
too
how
often
how
much
more
often
doth
thy
son
call
himself
a
way
and
a
light
and
a
gate
and
a
vine
and
bread
than
the
son
of
god
or
of
man
how
much
oftener
doth
he
exhibit
a
metaphorical
christ
than
a
real
a
literal
this
hath
occasioned
thine
ancient
servants
whose
delight
it
was
to
write
after
thy
copy
to
proceed
the
same
way
in
their
expositions
of
the
scriptures
and
in
their
composing
both
of
public
liturgies
and
of
private
prayers
to
thee
to
make
their
accesses
to
thee
in
such
a
kind
of
language
as
thou
wast
pleased
to
speak
to
them
in
a
figurative
in
a
metaphorical
language
in
which
manner
i
am
bold
to
call
the
comfort
which
i
receive
now
in
this
sickness
in
the
indication
of
the
concoction
and
maturity
thereof
in
certain
clouds
and
recidences
which
the
physicians
observe
a
discovering
of
land
from
sea
after
a
long
and
tempestuous
voyage
but
wherefore
o
my
god
hast
thou
presented
to
us
the
afflictions
and
calamities
of
this
life
in
the
name
of
waters
so
often
in
the
name
of
waters
and
deep
waters
and
seas
of
waters
must
we
look
to
be
drowned
are
they
bottomless
are
they
boundless
that
is
not
the
dialect
of
thy
language
thou
hast
given
a
remedy
against
the
deepest
water
by
water
against
the
inundation
of
sin
by
baptism
and
the
first
life
that
thou
gavest
to
any
creatures
was
in
waters
therefore
thou
dost
not
threaten
us
with
an
irremediableness
when
our
affliction
is
a
sea
it
is
so
if
we
consider
ourselves
so
thou
callest
genezareth
which
was
but
a
lake
and
not
salt
a
sea
so
thou
callest
the
mediterranean
sea
still
the
great
sea
because
the
inhabitants
saw
no
other
sea
they
that
dwelt
there
thought
a
lake
a
sea
and
the
others
thought
a
little
sea
the
greatest
and
we
that
know
not
the
afflictions
of
others
call
our
own
the
heaviest
but
o
my
god
that
is
truly
great
that
overflows
the
channel
that
is
really
a
great
affliction
which
is
above
my
strength
but
thou
o
god
art
my
strength
and
then
what
can
be
above
it
shake
with
the
swelling
of
thy
secular
mountains
men
strong
in
power
spiritual
mountains
men
strong
in
grace
are
shaken
with
afflictions
but
layest
up
thy
sea
in
even
thy
corrections
are
of
thy
treasure
and
thou
wilt
not
waste
thy
corrections
when
they
have
done
their
service
to
humble
thy
patient
thou
wilt
call
them
in
again
for
givest
the
sea
thy
decree
that
the
waters
should
not
pass
thy
all
our
waters
shall
run
into
jordan
and
thy
servants
passed
jordan
dry
foot
they
shall
run
into
the
red
sea
the
sea
of
thy
son
blood
and
the
red
sea
that
red
sea
drowns
none
of
thine
but
that
sail
on
the
sea
tell
of
the
danger
i
that
am
yet
in
this
affliction
owe
thee
the
glory
of
speaking
of
it
but
as
the
wise
man
bids
me
i
say
i
speak
much
and
come
short
wherefore
in
sum
thou
art
since
thou
art
so
o
my
god
and
affliction
is
a
sea
too
deep
for
us
what
is
our
refuge
thine
ark
thy
ship
in
all
other
afflictions
those
means
which
thou
hast
ordained
in
this
sea
in
sickness
thy
ship
is
thy
physician
hast
made
a
way
in
the
sea
and
a
safe
path
in
the
waters
showing
that
thou
canst
save
from
all
dangers
yea
though
a
man
went
to
sea
without
yet
where
i
find
all
that
i
find
this
added
thou
wouldst
not
that
the
work
of
thy
wisdom
should
be
thou
canst
save
without
means
but
thou
hast
told
no
man
that
thou
wilt
thou
hast
told
every
man
that
thou
wilt
not
when
the
centurion
believed
the
master
of
the
ship
more
than
paul
they
were
all
opened
to
a
great
danger
this
was
a
preferring
of
thy
means
before
thee
the
author
of
the
means
but
my
god
though
thou
beest
every
where
i
have
no
promise
of
appearing
to
me
but
in
thy
ship
thy
blessed
son
preached
out
of
a
ship
the
means
is
preaching
he
did
that
and
the
ship
was
a
type
of
the
church
he
did
it
there
thou
gavest
paul
the
lives
of
all
them
that
sailed
with
him
if
they
had
not
been
in
the
ship
with
him
the
gift
had
not
extended
to
them
soon
as
thy
son
was
come
out
of
the
ship
immediately
there
met
him
out
of
the
tombs
a
man
with
an
unclean
spirit
and
no
man
could
hold
him
no
not
with
thy
son
needed
no
use
of
means
yet
there
we
apprehend
the
danger
to
us
if
we
leave
the
ship
the
means
in
this
case
the
physician
but
as
they
are
ships
to
us
in
those
seas
so
is
there
a
ship
to
them
too
in
which
they
are
to
stay
give
me
leave
o
my
god
to
assist
myself
with
such
a
construction
of
these
words
of
thy
servant
paul
to
the
centurion
when
the
mariners
would
have
left
the
ship
these
abide
in
the
ship
you
can
not
be
except
they
who
are
our
ships
the
physicians
abide
in
that
which
is
theirs
and
our
ship
the
truth
and
the
sincere
and
religious
worship
of
thee
and
thy
gospel
we
can
not
promise
ourselves
so
good
safety
for
though
we
have
our
ship
the
physician
he
hath
not
his
ship
religion
and
means
are
not
means
but
in
their
concatenation
as
they
depend
and
are
chained
together
ships
are
says
thy
apostle
a
helm
turns
the
men
are
learned
but
their
religion
turns
their
labours
to
good
and
therefore
it
was
a
heavy
curse
when
third
part
of
the
ships
it
is
a
heavy
case
where
either
all
religion
or
true
religion
should
forsake
many
of
these
ships
whom
thou
hast
sent
to
convey
us
over
these
seas
but
o
my
god
my
god
since
i
have
my
ship
and
they
theirs
i
have
them
and
they
have
thee
why
are
we
yet
no
nearer
land
as
soon
as
thy
son
disciple
had
taken
him
into
the
ship
the
ship
was
at
the
land
whither
they
why
have
not
they
and
i
this
dispatch
every
thing
is
immediately
done
which
is
done
when
thou
wouldst
have
it
done
thy
purpose
terminates
every
action
and
what
was
done
before
that
is
undone
yet
shall
that
slacken
my
hope
thy
prophet
from
thee
hath
forbidden
it
is
good
that
a
man
should
both
hope
and
quietly
wait
for
the
salvation
of
the
thou
puttest
off
many
judgments
till
the
last
day
and
many
pass
this
life
without
any
and
shall
not
i
endure
the
putting
off
thy
mercy
for
a
day
and
yet
o
my
god
thou
puttest
me
not
to
that
for
the
assurance
of
future
mercy
is
present
mercy
but
what
is
my
assurance
now
what
is
my
seal
it
is
but
a
cloud
that
which
my
physicians
call
a
cloud
in
that
which
gives
them
their
indication
but
a
cloud
thy
great
seal
to
all
the
world
the
rainbow
that
secured
the
world
for
ever
from
drowning
was
but
a
reflection
upon
a
cloud
a
cloud
itself
was
a
pillar
which
guided
the
church
and
the
glory
of
god
not
only
was
but
appeared
in
a
cloud
let
me
return
o
my
god
to
the
consideration
of
thy
servant
elijah
proceeding
in
a
time
of
desperate
drought
he
bids
them
look
towards
the
sea
they
look
and
see
nothing
he
bids
them
again
and
again
seven
times
and
at
the
seventh
time
they
saw
a
little
cloud
rising
out
of
the
sea
and
presently
they
had
their
desire
of
rain
seven
days
o
my
god
have
we
looked
for
this
cloud
and
now
we
have
it
none
of
thy
indications
are
frivolous
thou
makest
thy
signs
seals
and
thy
seals
effects
and
thy
effects
consolation
and
restitution
wheresoever
thou
mayst
receive
glory
by
that
way
xix
prayer
o
eternal
and
most
gracious
god
who
though
thou
passedst
over
infinite
millions
of
generations
before
thou
camest
to
a
creation
of
this
world
yet
when
thou
beganst
didst
never
intermit
that
work
but
continuedst
day
to
day
till
thou
hadst
perfected
all
the
work
and
deposed
it
in
the
hands
and
rest
of
a
sabbath
though
thou
have
been
pleased
to
glorify
thyself
in
a
long
exercise
of
my
patience
with
an
expectation
of
thy
declaration
of
thyself
in
this
my
sickness
yet
since
thou
hast
now
of
thy
goodness
afforded
that
which
affords
us
some
hope
if
that
be
still
the
way
of
thy
glory
proceed
in
that
way
and
perfect
that
work
and
establish
me
in
a
sabbath
and
rest
in
thee
by
this
thy
seal
of
bodily
restitution
thy
priests
came
up
to
thee
by
steps
in
the
temple
thy
angels
came
down
to
jacob
by
steps
upon
the
ladder
we
find
no
stair
by
which
thou
thyself
camest
to
adam
in
paradise
nor
to
sodom
in
thine
anger
for
thou
and
thou
only
art
able
to
do
all
at
once
but
o
lord
i
am
not
weary
of
thy
pace
nor
weary
of
mine
own
patience
i
provoke
thee
not
with
a
prayer
not
with
a
wish
not
with
a
hope
to
more
haste
than
consists
with
thy
purpose
nor
look
that
any
other
thing
should
have
entered
into
thy
purpose
but
thy
glory
to
hear
thy
steps
coming
towards
me
is
the
same
comfort
as
to
see
thy
face
present
with
me
whether
thou
do
the
work
of
a
thousand
years
in
a
day
or
extend
the
work
of
a
day
to
a
thousand
years
as
long
as
thou
workest
it
is
light
and
comfort
heaven
itself
is
but
an
extension
of
the
same
joy
and
an
extension
of
this
mercy
to
proceed
at
thy
leisure
in
the
way
of
restitution
is
a
manifestation
of
heaven
to
me
here
upon
earth
from
that
people
to
whom
thou
appearedst
in
signs
and
in
types
the
jews
thou
art
departed
because
they
trusted
in
them
but
from
thy
church
to
whom
thou
hast
appeared
in
thyself
in
thy
son
thou
wilt
never
depart
because
we
can
not
trust
too
much
in
him
though
thou
have
afforded
me
these
signs
of
restitution
yet
if
i
confide
in
them
and
begin
to
say
all
was
but
a
natural
accident
and
nature
begins
to
discharge
herself
and
she
will
perfect
the
whole
work
my
hope
shall
vanish
because
it
is
not
in
thee
if
thou
shouldst
take
thy
hand
utterly
from
me
and
have
nothing
to

these
indications
of
digested
matter
they
proceed
to
xx
meditation
though
counsel
seem
rather
to
consist
of
spiritual
parts
than
action
yet
action
is
the
spirit
and
the
soul
of
counsel
counsels
are
not
always
determined
in
resolutions
we
can
not
always
say
this
was
concluded
actions
are
always
determined
in
effects
we
can
say
this
was
done
then
have
laws
their
reverence
and
their
majesty
when
we
see
the
judge
upon
the
bench
executing
them
then
have
counsels
of
war
their
impressions
and
their
operations
when
we
see
the
seal
of
an
army
set
to
them
it
was
an
ancient
way
of
celebrating
the
memory
of
such
as
deserved
well
of
the
state
to
afford
them
that
kind
of
statuary
representation
which
was
then
called
hermes
which
was
the
head
and
shoulders
of
a
man
standing
upon
a
cube
but
those
shoulders
without
arms
and
hands
altogether
it
figured
a
constant
supporter
of
the
state
by
his
counsel
but
in
this
hieroglyphic
which
they
made
without
hands
they
pass
their
consideration
no
farther
but
that
the
counsellor
should
be
without
hands
so
far
as
not
to
reach
out
his
hand
to
foreign
temptations
of
bribes
in
matters
of
counsel
and
that
it
was
not
necessary
that
the
head
should
employ
his
own
hand
that
the
same
men
should
serve
in
the
execution
which
assisted
in
the
counsel
but
that
there
should
not
belong
hands
to
every
head
action
to
every
counsel
was
never
intended
so
much
as
in
figure
and
representation
for
as
matrimony
is
scarce
to
be
called
matrimony
where
there
is
a
resolution
against
the
fruits
of
matrimony
against
the
having
of
children
so
counsels
are
not
counsels
but
illusions
where
there
is
from
the
beginning
no
purpose
to
execute
the
determinations
of
those
counsels
the
arts
and
sciences
are
most
properly
referred
to
the
head
that
is
their
proper
element
and
sphere
but
yet
the
art
of
proving
logic
and
the
art
of
persuading
rhetoric
are
deduced
to
the
hand
and
that
expressed
by
a
hand
contracted
into
a
fist
and
this
by
a
hand
enlarged
and
expanded
and
evermore
the
power
of
man
and
the
power
of
god
himself
is
expressed
so
all
things
are
in
his
hand
neither
is
god
so
often
presented
to
us
by
names
that
carry
our
consideration
upon
counsel
as
upon
execution
of
counsel
he
oftener
is
called
the
lord
of
hosts
than
by
all
other
names
that
may
be
referred
to
the
other
signification
hereby
therefore
we
take
into
our
meditation
the
slippery
condition
of
man
whose
happiness
in
any
kind
the
defect
of
any
one
thing
conducing
to
that
happiness
may
ruin
but
it
must
have
all
the
pieces
to
make
it
up
without
counsel
i
had
not
got
thus
far
without
action
and
practice
i
should
go
no
farther
towards
health
but
what
is
the
present
necessary
action
purging
a
withdrawing
a
violating
of
nature
a
farther
weakening
o
dear
price
and
o
strange
way
of
addition
to
do
it
by
subtraction
of
restoring
nature
to
violate
nature
of
providing
strength
by
increasing
weakness
was
i
not
sick
before
and
is
it
a
question
of
comfort
to
be
asked
now
did
your
physic
make
you
sick
was
that
it
that
my
physic
promised
to
make
me
sick
this
is
another
step
upon
which
we
may
stand
and
see
farther
into
the
misery
of
man
the
time
the
season
of
his
misery
it
must
be
done
now
o
and
misery
of
man
that
seldom
comes
alone
but
then
when
it
may
accompany
other
miseries
and
so
put
one
another
into
the
higher
exaltation
and
better
heart
i
am
ground
even
to
an
attenuation
and
must
proceed
to
evacuation
all
ways
to
exinanition
and
annihilation
xx
expostulation
my
god
my
god
the
god
of
order
but
yet
not
of
ambition
who
assignest
place
to
every
one
but
not
contention
for
place
when
shall
it
be
thy
pleasure
to
put
an
end
to
all
these
quarrels
for
spiritual
precedences
when
shall
men
leave
their
uncharitable
disputations
which
is
to
take
place
faith
or
repentance
and
which
when
we
consider
faith
and
works
the
head
and
the
hand
too
are
required
to
a
perfect
natural
man
counsel
and
action
too
to
a
perfect
civil
man
faith
and
works
too
to
him
that
is
perfectly
spiritual
but
because
it
is
easily
said
i
believe
and
because
it
doth
not
easily
lie
in
proof
nor
is
easily
demonstrable
by
any
evidence
taken
from
my
heart
for
who
sees
that
who
searches
those
rolls
whether
i
do
believe
or
no
is
it
not
therefore
o
my
god
that
thou
dost
so
frequently
so
earnestly
refer
us
to
the
hand
to
the
observation
of
actions
there
is
a
little
suspicion
a
little
imputation
laid
upon
and
dilatory
counsels
many
good
occasions
slip
away
in
long
consultations
and
it
may
be
a
degree
of
sloth
to
be
too
long
in
mending
nets
though
that
must
be
done
that
observeth
the
wind
shall
not
sow
and
he
that
regardeth
the
clouds
shall
not
that
is
he
that
is
too
dilatory
too
superstitious
in
these
observations
and
studies
but
the
excuse
of
his
own
idleness
in
them
but
that
which
the
same
wise
and
royal
servant
of
thine
says
in
another
place
all
accept
and
ask
no
comment
upon
it
becometh
poor
that
dealeth
with
a
slack
hand
but
the
hand
of
the
diligent
maketh
all
evil
imputed
to
the
absence
all
good
attributed
to
the
presence
of
the
hand
i
know
my
god
and
i
bless
thy
name
for
knowing
it
for
all
good
knowledge
is
from
thee
that
thou
considerest
the
heart
but
thou
takest
not
off
thine
eye
till
thou
come
to
the
hand
nay
my
god
doth
not
thy
spirit
intimate
that
thou
beginnest
where
we
begin
at
least
that
thou
allowest
us
to
begin
there
when
thou
orderest
thine
own
answer
to
thine
own
question
shall
ascend
into
the
hill
of
the
thus
that
hath
clean
hands
and
a
pure
dost
thou
not
at
least
send
us
first
to
the
hand
and
is
not
the
work
of
their
hands
that
declaration
of
their
holy
zeal
in
the
present
execution
of
manifest
idolators
called
a
consecration
of
themselves
by
thy
holy
spirit
their
hands
are
called
all
themselves
for
even
counsel
itself
goes
under
that
name
in
thy
word
who
knowest
best
how
to
give
right
names
because
the
counsel
of
the
priests
assisted
david
saul
says
the
hand
of
the
priest
is
with
david
and
that
which
is
often
said
by
moses
is
very
often
repeated
by
thy
other
prophets
and
these
things
the
lord
and
lord
and
lord
not
by
the
counsels
not
by
the
voice
but
by
the
of
and
by
the
of
the
evermore
we
are
referred
for
our
evidence
of
others
and
of
ourselves
to
the
hand
to
action
to
works
there
is
something
before
it
believing
and
there
is
something
after
it
suffering
but
in
the
most
eminent
and
obvious
and
conspicuous
place
stands
doing
why
then
o
my
god
my
blessed
god
in
the
ways
of
my
spiritual
strength
come
i
so
slow
to
action
i
was
whipped
by
thy
rod
before
i
came
to
consultation
to
consider
my
state
and
shall
i
go
no
farther
as
he
that
would
describe
a
circle
in
paper
if
he
have
brought
that
circle
within
one
inch
of
finishing
yet
if
he
remove
his
compass
he
can
not
make
it
up
a
perfect
circle
except
he
fall
to
work
again
to
find
out
the
same
centre
so
though
setting
that
foot
of
my
compass
upon
thee
i
have
gone
so
far
as
to
the
consideration
of
myself
yet
if
i
depart
from
thee
my
centre
all
is
imperfect
this
proceeding
to
action
therefore
is
a
returning
to
thee
and
a
working
upon
myself
by
thy
physic
by
thy
purgative
physic
a
free
and
entire
evacuation
of
my
soul
by
confession
the
working
of
purgative
physic
is
violent
and
contrary
to
nature
o
lord
i
decline
not
this
potion
of
confession
however
it
may
be
contrary
to
a
natural
man
to
take
physic
and
not
according
to
the
right
method
is
dangerous
o
lord
i
decline
not
that
method
in
this
physic
in
things
that
burthen
my
conscience
to
make
my
confession
to
him
into
whose
hands
thou
hast
put
the
power
of
absolution
i
know
that
physic
may
be
made
so
pleasant
as
that
it
may
easily
be
taken
but
not
so
pleasant
as
the
virtue
and
nature
of
the
medicine
be
extinguished
i
know
i
am
not
submitted
to
such
a
confession
as
is
a
rack
and
torture
of
the
conscience
but
i
know
i
am
not
exempt
from
all
if
it
were
merely
problematical
left
merely
indifferent
whether
we
should
take
this
physic
use
this
confession
or
no
a
great
physician
acknowledges
this
to
have
been
his
practice
to
minister
to
many
things
which
he
was
not
sure
would
do
good
but
never
any
other
thing
but
such
as
he
was
sure
would
do
no
harm
the
use
of
this
spiritual
physic
can
certainly
do
no
harm
and
the
church
hath
always
thought
that
it
might
and
doubtless
many
humble
souls
have
found
that
it
hath
done
them
good
will
therefore
take
the
cup
of
salvation
and
call
upon
thy
i
will
find
this
cup
of
compunction
as
full
as
i
have
formerly
filled
the
cups
of
worldly
confections
that
so
i
may
escape
the
cup
of
malediction
and
irrecoverable
destruction
that
depends
upon
that
and
since
thy
blessed
and
glorious
son
being
offered
in
the
way
to
his
execution
a
cup
of
stupefaction
to
take
away
the
sense
of
his
pain
a
charity
afforded
to
condemned
persons
ordinarily
in
those
places
and
times
refused
that
ease
and
embraced
the
whole
torment
i
take
not
this
cup
but
this
vessel
of
mine
own
sins
into
my
contemplation
and
i
pour
them
out
here
according
to
the
motions
of
thy
holy
spirit
and
any
where
according
to
the
ordinances
of
thy
holy
church
xx
prayer
o
eternal
and
most
gracious
god
who
having
married
man
and
woman
together
and
made
them
one
flesh
wouldst
have
them
also
to
become
one
soul
so
as
that
they
might
maintain
a
sympathy
in
their
affections
and
have
a
conformity
to
one
another
in
the
accidents
of
this
world
good
or
bad
so
having
married
this
soul
and
this
body
in
me
i
humbly
beseech
thee
that
my
soul
may
look
and
make
her
use
of
thy
merciful
proceedings
towards
my
bodily
restitution
and
go
the
same
way
to
a
spiritual
i
am
come
by
thy
goodness
to
the
use
of
thine
ordinary
means
for
my
body
to
wash
away
those
peccant
humours
that
endangered
it
i
have
o
lord
a
river
in
my
body
but
a
sea
in
my
soul
and
a
sea
swollen
into
the
depth
of
a
deluge
above
the
sea
thou
hast
raised
up
certain
hills
in
me
heretofore
by
which
i
might
have
stood
safe
from
these
inundations
of
sin
even
our
natural
faculties
are
a
hill
and
might
preserve
us
from
some
sin
education
study
observation
example
are
hills
too
and
might
preserve
us
from
some
thy
church
and
thy
word
and
thy
sacraments
and
thine
ordinances
are
hills
above
these
thy
spirit
of
remorse
and
compunction
and
repentance
for
former
sin
are
hills
too
and
to
the
top
of
all
these
hills
thou
hast
brought
me
heretofore
but
this
deluge
this
inundation
is
got
above
all
my
hills
and
i
have
sinned
and
sinned
and
multiplied
sin
to
sin
after
all
these
thy
assistances
against
sin
and
where
is
there
water
enough
to
wash
away
this
deluge
there
is
a
red
sea
greater
than
this
ocean
and
there
is
a
little
spring
through
which
this
ocean
may
pour
itself
into
that
red
sea
let
thy
spirit
of
true
contrition
and
sorrow
pass
all
my
sins
through
these
eyes
into
the
wounds
of
thy
son
and
i
shall
be
clean
and
my
soul
so
much
better
purged
than
my
body
as
it
is
ordained
for
better
and
a
longer
life

how
large
a
glass
of
the
next
world
is
this
as
we
have
an
art
to
cast
from
one
glass
to
another
and
so
to
carry
the
species
a
great
way
off
so
hast
thou
that
way
much
more
we
shall
have
a
resurrection
in
heaven
the
knowledge
of
that
thou
castest
by
another
glass
upon
us
here
we
feel
that
we
have
a
resurrection
from
sin
and
that
by
another
glass
too
we
see
we
have
a
resurrection
of
the
body
from
the
miseries
and
calamities
of
this
life
this
resurrection
of
my
body
shows
me
the
resurrection
of
my
soul
and
both
here
severally
of
both
together
hereafter
since
thy
martyrs
under
the
altar
press
thee
with
their
solicitation
for
the
resurrection
of
the
body
to
glory
thou
wouldst
pardon
me
if
i
should
press
thee
by
prayer
for
the
accomplishing
of
this
resurrection
which
thou
hast
begun
in
me
to
health
but
o
my
god
i
do
not
ask
where
i
might
ask
amiss
nor
beg
that
which
perchance
might
be
worse
for
me
i
have
a
bed
of
sin
delight
in
sin
is
a
bed
i
have
a
grave
of
sin
senselessness
of
sin
is
a
grave
and
where
lazarus
had
been
four
days
i
have
been
fifty
years
in
this
putrefaction
why
dost
thou
not
call
me
as
thou
didst
him
a
loud
since
my
soul
is
as
dead
as
his
body
was
i
need
thy
thunder
o
my
god
thy
music
will
not
serve
me
thou
hast
called
thy
servants
who
are
to
work
upon
us
in
thine
ordinance
by
all
these
loud
names
winds
and
chariots
and
falls
of
waters
where
thou
wouldst
be
heard
thou
wilt
be
heard
when
thy
son
concurred
with
thee
to
the
making
of
man
there
it
is
but
a
speaking
but
a
saying
there
o
blessed
and
glorious
trinity
was
none
to
hear
but
you
three
and
you
easily
hear
one
another
because
you
say
the
same
things
but
when
thy
son
came
to
the
work
of
redemption
thou
spokest
and
they
that
heard
it
took
it
for
thunder
and
thy
son
himself
cried
with
a
loud
voice
upon
the
cross
twice
as
he
who
was
to
prepare
his
coming
john
baptist
was
the
voice
of
a
crier
and
not
of
a
whisperer
still
if
it
be
thy
voice
it
is
a
loud
voice
says
thy
moses
spokest
with
a
great
voice
and
thou
addedst
no
says
he
there
that
which
thou
hast
said
is
evident
and
it
is
evident
that
none
can
speak
so
loud
none
can
bind
us
to
hear
him
as
we
must
thee
most
high
uttered
his
what
was
his
voice
lord
thundered
from
it
might
be
heard
but
this
voice
thy
voice
is
also
a
not
only
mighty
in
power
it
may
be
heard
nor
mighty
in
obligation
it
should
be
heard
but
mighty
in
operation
it
will
be
heard
and
therefore
hast
thou
bestowed
a
whole
psalm
upon
us
to
lead
us
to
the
consideration
of
thy
voice
it
is
such
a
voice
as
that
thy
son
says
dead
shall
hear
and
that
is
my
state
and
why
o
god
dost
thou
not
speak
to
me
in
that
effectual
loudness
saint
john
heard
a
voice
and
turned
about
to
see
the
sometimes
we
are
too
curious
of
the
instrument
by
what
man
god
speaks
but
thou
speakest
loudest
when
thou
speakest
to
the
heart
was
silence
and
i
heard
a
says
one
to
thy
servant
job
i
hearken
after
thy
voice
in
thine
ordinances
and
i
seek
not
a
whispering
in
conventicles
but
yet
o
my
god
speak
louder
that
so
though
i
do
hear
thee
now
then
i
may
hear
nothing
but
thee
my
sins
cry
aloud
cain
murder
did
so
my
afflictions
cry
aloud
floods
have
lifted
up
their
and
waters
are
afflictions
thou
o
lord
art
mightier
than
the
voice
of
many
than
many
temporal
many
spiritual
afflictions
than
any
of
either
kind
and
why
dost
thou
not
speak
to
me
in
that
voice
is

and
whereto
serveth
he
what
is
his
good
and
what
is
his
evil
my
bed
of
sin
is
not
evil
not
desperately
evil
for
thou
dost
call
me
out
of
it
but
my
rising
out
of
it
is
not
good
not
perfectly
good
if
thou
call
not
louder
and
hold
me
now
i
am
up
o
my
god
i
am
afraid
of
a
fearful
application
of
those
words
a
man
hath
done
then
he
when
this
body
is
unable
to
sin
his
sinful
memory
sins
over
his
old
sins
again
and
that
which
thou
wouldst
have
us
to
remember
for
compunction
we
remember
with
delight
him
to
me
in
his
bed
that
i
may
kill
says
saul
of
david
thou
hast
not
said
so
that
is
not
thy

joash
own
servants
slew
him
when
he
was
sick
in
his
bed
thou
hast
not
suffered
that
that
my
servants
should
so
much
as
neglect
me
or
be
weary
of
me
in
my
sickness
thou
threatenest
that
a
shepherd
takes
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
lion
two
legs
or
a
piece
of
an
ear
so
shall
the
children
of
israel
that
dwell
in
samaria
in
the
corner
of
a
bed
and
in
damascus
in
a
couch
be
taken
and
even
they
that
are
secure
from
danger
shall
perish
how
much
more
might
i
who
was
in
the
bed
of
death
die
but
thou
hast
not
so
dealt
with
me
as
they
brought
out
sick
persons
in
beds
that
thy
servant
peter
shadow
might
them
thou
hast
o
my
god
me
refreshed
me
but
when
wilt
thou
do
more
when
wilt
thou
do
all
when
wilt
thou
speak
in
thy
loud
voice
when
wilt
thou
bid
me
up
my
bed
and
as
my
bed
is
my
affections
when
shall
i
bear
them
so
as
to
subdue
them
as
my
bed
is
my
afflictions
when
shall
i
bear
them
so
as
not
to
murmur
at
them
when
shall
i
take
up
my
bed
and
walk
not
lie
down
upon
it
as
it
is
my
pleasure
not
sink
under
it
as
it
is
my
correction
but
o
my
god
my
god
the
god
of
all
flesh
and
of
all
spirit
to
let
me
be
content
with
that
in
my
fainting
spirit
which
thou
declarest
in
this
decayed
flesh
that
as
this
body
is
content
to
sit
still
that
it
may
learn
to
stand
and
to
learn
by
standing
to
walk
and
by
walking
to
travel
so
my
soul
by
obeying
this
thy
voice
of
rising
may
by
a
farther
and
farther
growth
of
thy
grace
proceed
so
and
be
so
established
as
may
remove
all
suspicions
all
jealousies
between
thee
and
me
and
may
speak
and
hear
in
such
a
voice
as
that
still
i
may
be
acceptable
to
thee
and
satisfied
from
thee
xxi
prayer
o
eternal
and
most
gracious
god
who
hast
made
little
things
to
signify
great
and
conveyed
the
infinite
merits
of
thy
son
in
the
water
of
baptism
and
in
the
bread
and
wine
of
thy
other
sacrament
unto
us
receive
the
sacrifice
of
my
humble
thanks
that
thou
hast
not
only
afforded
me
the
ability
to
rise
out
of
this
bed
of
weariness
and
discomfort
but
hast
also
made
this
bodily
rising
by
thy
grace
an
earnest
of
a
second
resurrection
from
sin
and
of
a
third
to
everlasting
glory
thy
son
himself
always
infinite
in
himself
and
incapable
of
addition
was
yet
pleased
to
grow
in
the
virgin
womb
and
to
grow
in
stature
in
the
sight
of
men
thy
good
purposes
upon
me
i
know
have
their
determination
and
perfection
in
thy
holy
will
upon
me
there
thy
grace
is
and
there
i
am
altogether
but
manifest
them
so
unto
me
in
thy
seasons
and
in
thy
measures
and
degrees
that
i
may
not
only
have
that
comfort
of
knowing
thee
to
be
infinitely
good
but
that
also
of
finding
thee
to
be
every
day
better
and
better
to
me
and
that
as
thou
gavest
saint
paul
the
messenger
of
satan
to
humble
him
so
for
my
humiliation
thou
mayst
give
me
thyself
in
this
knowledge
that
what
grace
soever
thou
afford
me
yet
i
should
perish
if
i
had
not
had
grace
too
therefore
i
beg
of
thee
my
daily
bread
and
as
thou
gavest
me
the
bread
of
sorrow
for
many
days
and
since
the
bread
of
hope
for
some
and
this
day
the
bread
of
possessing
in
rising
by
that
strength
which
thou
the
god
of
all
strength
hast
infused
into
me
so
o
lord
continue
to
me
the
bread
of
life
the
spiritual
bread
of
life
in
a
faithful
assurance
in
thee
the
sacramental
bread
of
life
in
a
worthy
receiving
of
thee
and
the
more
real
bread
of
life
in
an
everlasting
union
to
thee
i
know
o
lord
that
when
thou
hast
created
angels
and
they
saw
thee
produce
fowl
and
fish
and
beasts
and
worms
they
did
not
importune
thee
and
say
shall
we
have
no
better
creatures
than
these
no
better
companions
than
these
but
stayed
thy
leisure
and
then
had
man
delivered
over
to
them
not
much
inferior
in
nature
to
themselves
no
more
do
i
o
god
now
that
by
thy
first
mercy
i
am
able
to
rise
importune
thee
for
present
confirmation
of
health
nor
now
that
by
thy
mercy
i
am
brought
to
see
that
thy
correction
hath
wrought
medicinally
upon
me
presume
i
upon
that
spiritual
strength
i
have
but
as
i
acknowledge
that
my
bodily
strength
is
subject
to
every
puff
of
wind
so
is
my
spiritual
strength
to
every
blast
of
vanity
keep
me
therefore
still
o
my
gracious
god
in
such
a
proportion
of
both
strengths
as
i
may
still
have
something
to
thank
thee
for
which
i
have
received
and
still
something
to
pray
for
and
ask
at
thy
hand

meditation
how

man
taken
in
taking
himself
how
ready
is
the
house
every
day
to
fall
down
and
how
is
all
the
ground
overspread
with
weeds
all
the
body
with
diseases
where
not
only
every
turf
but
every
stone
bears
weeds
not
only
every

every
bone
of
the

every

upon

some
infectious
weed
every

in

a
pain
as
a
constant
man
is
afraid
of
and
yet
ashamed
of
that
fear
of
that
sense
of
the
pain
how
dear
and
how
often
a
rent
doth
man
pay
for
his
farm
he
pays
twice
a
day
in
double
meals
and
how
little
time
he
hath
to
raise
his
rent
how
many
holidays
to
call
him
from
his
labour
every
day
is
half
holiday
half
spent
in
sleep
what
reparations
and
subsidies
and
contributions
he
is
put
to
besides
his
rent
what
medicines
besides
his
diet
and
what
inmates
he
is
fain
to
take
in
besides
his
own
family
what
infectious
diseases
from
other
men
adam
might
have
had
paradise
for
dressing
and
keeping
it
and
then
his
rent
was
not
improved
to
such
a
labour
as
would
have
made
his
brow
sweat
and
yet
he
gave
it
over
how
far
greater
a
rent
do
we
pay
for
this
farm
this
body
who
pay
ourselves
who
pay
the
farm
itself
and
can
not
live
upon
it
neither
is
our
labour
at
an
end
when
we
have
cut
down
some
weed
as
soon
as
it
sprung
up
corrected
some
violent
and
dangerous
accident
of
a
disease
which
would
have
destroyed
speedily
nor
when
we
have
pulled
up
that
weed
from
the
very
root
recovered
entirely
and
soundly
from
that
particular
disease
but
the
whole
ground
is
of
an
ill
nature
the
whole
soil
ill
disposed
there
are
inclinations
there
is
a
propenseness
to
diseases
in
the
body
out
of
which
without
any
other
disorder
diseases
will
grow
and
so
we
are
put
to
a
continual
labour
upon
this
farm
to
a
continual
study
of
the
whole
complexion
and
constitution
of
our
body
in
the
distempers
and
diseases
of
soils
sourness

weeping
any
kind
of

the
remedy
and
the

for
a

part
sometimes
in
themselves
sometimes
the
very
situation
relieves
them
the
hanger
of
a
hill
will
purge
and
vent
his
own
malignant
moisture
and
the
burning
of
the
upper
turf
of
some
ground
as
health
from
cauterizing
puts
a
new
and
a
vigorous
youth
into
that
soil
and
there
rises
a
kind
of
phoenix
out
of
the
ashes
a
fruitfulness
out
of
that
which
was
barren
before
and
by
that
which
is
the
barrenest
of
all
ashes
and
where
the
ground
can
not
give
itself
physic
yet
it
receives
physic
from
other
grounds
from
other
soils
which
are
not
the
worse
for
having
contributed
that
help
to
them
from
marl
in

hills
or
from

sand
in

grounds
help
themselves
or
hurt
not
other
grounds
from
whence
they
receive

but
i
have
taken
a
farm
at
this
hard
rent
and
upon
those
heavy
covenants
that
it
can
afford
itself
no
help
no
part
of
my
body
if
it
were
cut
off
would
cure
another
part
in
some
cases
it
might
preserve
a
sound
part

in
no

recover
an
infected
and
if
my

may
have
had
any

any
medicine
from

body
one

from
the
flesh
of
another
man
as
by

or
any
such
composition
it
must
be
from
a
man
that
is
dead
and
not
as
in
other
soils
which
are
never
the
worse
for
contributing
their
marl
or
their
fat
slime
to
my
ground
there
is
nothing
in
the
same
man
to
help
man
nothing
in
mankind
to
help
one
another
in
this
sort
by
way
of
physic
but
that
he
who
ministers
the
help
is
in
as
ill
case
as

that
receives
it
would
have
been
if
he
had
not
had

of

meditation
it
is
not
in
man
body
as
it
is
in
the
city
that
when
the
bell
hath
rung
to
cover
your
fire
and
rake
up
the
embers
you
may
lie
down
and
sleep
without
fear
though
you
have
by
physic
and
diet
raked
up
the
embers
of
your
disease
still
there
is
a
fear
of
a
relapse
and
the
greater
danger
is
in
that
even
in
pleasures
and
in
pains
there
is
a
proprietary
a
et
and
a
man
is
most
affected
with
that
pleasure
which
is
his
his
by
former
enjoying
and
experience
and
most
intimidated
with
those
pains
which
are
his
his
by
a
woful
sense
of
them
in
former
afflictions
a
covetous
person
who
hath
preoccupated
all
his
senses
filled
all
his
capacities
with
the
delight
of
gathering
wonders
how
any
man
can
have
any
taste
of
any
pleasure
in
any
openness
or
liberality
so
also
in
bodily
pains
in
a
fit
of
the
stone
the
patient
wonders
why
any
man
should
call
the
gout
a
pain
and
he
that
hath
felt
neither
but
the
toothache
is
as
much
afraid
of
a
fit
of
that
as
either
of
the
other
of
either
of
the
other
diseases
which
we
never
felt
in
ourselves
come
but
to
a
compassion
of
others
that
have
endured
them
nay
compassion
itself
comes
to
no
great
degree
if
we
have
not
felt
in
some
proportion
in
ourselves
that
which
we
lament
and
condole
in
another
but
when
we
have
had
those
torments
in
their
exaltation
ourselves
we
tremble
at
relapse
when
we
must
pant
through
all
those
fiery
heats
and
sail
through
all
those
overflowing
sweats
when
we
must
watch
through
all
those
long
nights
and
mourn
through
all
those
long
days
days
and
nights
so
long
as
that
nature
herself
shall
seem
to
be
perverted
and
to
have
put
the
longest
day
and
the
longest
night
which
should
be
six
months
asunder
into
one
natural
unnatural
day
when
we
must
stand
at
the
same
bar
expect
the
return
of
physicians
from
their
consultations
and
not
be
sure
of
the
same
verdict
in
any
good
indications
when
we
must
go
the
same
way
over
again
and
not
see
the
same
issue
that
is
a
state
a
condition
a
calamity
in
respect
of
which
any
other
sickness
were
a
convalescence
and
any
greater
less
it
adds
to
the
affliction
that
relapses
are
and
for
the
most
part
justly
imputed
to
ourselves
as
occasioned
by
some
disorder
in
us
and
so
we
are
not
only
passive
but
active
in
our
own
ruin
we
do
not
only
stand
under
a
falling
house
but
pull
it
down
upon
us
and
we
are
not
only
executed
that
implies
guiltiness
but
we
are
executioners
that
implies
dishonour
and
executioners
of
ourselves
and
that
implies
impiety
and
we
fall
from
that
comfort
which
we
might
have
in
our
first
sickness
from
that
meditation
alas
how
generally
miserable
is
man
and
how
subject
to
diseases
for
in
that
it
is
some
degree
of
comfort
that
we
are
but
in
the
state
common
to
all
we
fall
i
say
to
this
discomfort
and
and
alas
how
improvident
and
in
that
how
unthankful
to
god
and
his
instruments
am
i
in
making
so
ill
use
of
so
great
benefits
in
destroying
so
soon
so
long
a
work
in
relapsing
by
my
disorder
to
that
from
which
they
had
delivered
me
and
so
my
meditation
is
fearfully
transferred
from
the
body
to
the
mind
and
from
the
consideration
of
the
sickness
to
that
sin
that
sinful
carelessness
by
which
i
have
occasioned
my
relapse
and
amongst
the
many
weights
that
aggravate
a
relapse
this
also
is
one
that
a
relapse
proceeds
with
a
more
violent
dispatch
and
more
irremediably
because
it
finds
the
country
weakened
and
depopulated
before
upon
a
sickness
which
as
yet
appears
not
we
can
scarce
fix
a
fear
because
we
know
not
what
to
fear
but
as
fear
is
the
busiest
and
irksomest
affection
so
is
a
relapse
which
is
still
ready
to
come
into
that
which
is
but
newly
gone
the
nearest
object
the
most
immediate
exercise
of
that
affection
of
fear
xxiii
expostulation

my

my

thou
mighty
father
who

thou
glorious
son
who
hast
been

thou

who
hast
prepared

i
alone
be
able
to
overthrow
the

you

relapse
into
those
spiritual
sicknesses
from
which
infinite
mercies
have
withdrawn
me
though
thou
o
my
god
have
filled
my
measure
with
mercy
yet
my
measure
was
not
so
large
as
that
of
thy
whole
people
the
nation
the
numerous
and
glorious
nation
of
israel
and
yet
how
often
how
often
did
they
fall
into
relapses
and
then
where
is
my
assurance
how
easily
thou
passedst
over
many
other
sins
in
them
and
how
vehemently
thou
insistedst
in
those
into
which
they
so
often
relapsed
those
were
their
murmurings
against
thee
in
thine
instruments
and
ministers
and
their
turnings
upon
other
gods
and
embracing
the
idolatries
of
their
neighbours
o
my
god
how
slippery
a
way
to
how
irrecoverable
a
bottom
is
murmuring
and
how
near
thyself
he
comes
that
murmurs
at
him
who
comes
from
thee
the
magistrate
is
the
garment
in
which
thou
apparelest
thyself
and
he
that
shoots
at
the
clothes
can
not
say
he
meant
no
ill
to
the
man
thy
people
were
fearful
examples
of
that
for
how
often
did
their
murmuring
against
thy
ministers
end
in
a
departing
from
thee
when
they
would
have
other
officers
they
would
have
other
gods
and
still
murmuring
was
idolatry
as
their
murmuring
induced
idolatry
and
they
relapsed
often
into
both
i
have
found
in
myself
o
my
god
o
my
god
thou
hast
found
it
in
me
and
thy
finding
it
hast
showed
it
to
me
such
a
transmigration
of
sin
as
makes
me
afraid
of
relapsing
too
the
soul
of
sin
for
we
have
made
sin
immortal
and
it
must
have
a
soul
the
soul
of
sin
is
disobedience
to
thee
and
when
one
sin
hath
been
dead
in
me
that
soul
hath
passed
into
another
sin
our
youth
dies
and
the
sins
of
our
youth
with
it
some
sins
die
a
violent
death
and
some
a
natural
poverty
penury
imprisonment
banishment
kill
some
sins
in
us
and
some
die
of
age
many
ways
we
become
unable
to
do
that
sin
but
still
the
soul
lives
and
passes
into
another
sin
and
that
that
was
licentiousness
grows
ambition
and
that
comes
to
indevotion
and
spiritual
coldness
we
have
three
lives
in
our
state
of
sin
and
where
the
sins
of
youth
expire
those
of
our
middle
years
enter
and
those
of
our
age
after
them
this
transmigration
of
sin
found
in
myself
makes
me
afraid
o
my
god
of
a
relapse
but
the
occasion
of
my
fear
is
more
pregnant
than
so
for
i
have
had
i
have
multiplied
relapses
already
why
o
my
god
is
a
relapse
so
odious
to
thee
not
so
much
their
murmuring
and
their
idolatry
as
their
relapsing
into
those
sins
seems
to
affect
thee
in
thy
disobedient
people
limited
the
holy
one
of
as
thou
complainest
of
them
that
was
a
murmuring
but
before
thou
chargest
them
with
the
fault
itself
in
the
same
place
thou
chargest
them
with
the
iterating
the
redoubling
of
that
fault
before
the
fault
was
named
oft
did
they
provoke
me
in
the
wilderness
and
grieve
me
in
the
desert
that
which
brings
thee
to
that
exasperation
against
them
as
to
say
that
thou
wouldst
break
thine

oath
rather
than
leave

these
nations
from
before
you
but
they
shall
be
snares
and
traps
unto
you
and
scourges
in
your
sides
and
thorns
in
your
eyes
till
ye
no
tongue
but
thine
own
o
my
god
can
express
thine
indignation
against
a
nation
relapsing
to
idolatry
idolatry
in
any
nation
is
deadly
but
when
the
disease
is
complicated
with
a
relapse
a
knowledge
and
a
profession
of
a
former
recovery
it
is
desperate
and
thine
anger
works
not
only
where
the
evidence
is
pregnant
and
without
exception
so
thou
sayest
when
it
is
said
that
certain
men
in
a
city
have
withdrawn
others
to
idolatry
and
that
inquiry
is
made
and
it
is
found
true
the
city
and
the
inhabitants
and
the
cattle
are
to
be
destroyed
but
where
there
is
but
a
suspicion
a
rumour
of
such
a
relapse
to
idolatry
thine
anger
is
awakened
and
thine
indignation
stirred
in
the
government
of
thy
servant
joshua
there
was
a
voice
that
reuben
and
gad
with
those
of
manasseh
had
built
a
new
altar
israel
doth
not
send
one
to
inquire
but
the
whole
congregation
gathered
to
go
up
to
war
against
them
and
there
went
a
prince
of
every
tribe
and
they
object
to
them
not
so
much
their
present
declination
to
idolatry
as
their
relapse
the
iniquity
of
peor
too
little
for
us
an
idolatry
formerly
committed
and
punished
with
the
slaughter
of
thousand
delinquents
at
last
reuben
and
gad
satisfy
them
that
that
altar
was
not
built
for
idolatry
but
built
as
a
pattern
of
theirs
that
they
might
thereby
profess
themselves
to
be
of
the
same
profession
that
they
were
and
so
the
army
returned
without
blood
even
where
it
comes
not
so
far
as
to
an
actual
relapse
into
idolatry
thou
o
my
god
becomest
sensible
of
it
though
thou
who
seest
the
heart
all
the
way
preventest
all
dangerous
effects
where
there
was
no
ill
meaning
however
there
were
occasion
of
suspicious
rumours
given
to
thine
israel
of
relapsing
so
odious
to
thee
and
so
aggravating
a
weight
upon
sin
is
a
relapse
but
o
my
god
why
is
it
so
so
odious
it
must
be
so
because
he
that
hath
sinned
and
then
repented
hath
weighed
god
and
the
devil
in
a
balance
he
hath
heard
god
and
the
devil
plead
and
after
hearing
given
judgment
on
that
side
to
which
he
adheres
by
his
subsequent
practice
if
he
return
to
his
sin
he
decrees
for
satan
he
prefers
sin
before
grace
and
satan
before
god
and
in
contempt
of
god
declares
the
precedency
for
his
adversary
and
a
contempt
wounds
deeper
than
an
injury
a
relapse
deeper
than
a
blasphemy
and
when
thou
hast
told
me
that
a
relapse
is
more
odious
to
thee
need
i
ask
why
it
is
more
dangerous
more
pernicious
to
me
is
there
any
other
measure
of
the
greatness
of
my
danger
than
the
greatness
of
thy
displeasure
how
fitly
and
how
fearfully
hast
thou
expressed
my
case
in
a
storm
at
sea
if
i
relapse
mount
up
to
heaven
and
they
go
down
again
to
the
my
sickness
brought
me
to
thee
in
repentance
and
my
relapse
hath
cast
me
farther
from
thee
end
of
that
man
shall
be
worse
than
the
says
thy
word
thy
son
my
beginning
was
sickness
punishment
for
sin
but
worse
thing
may
says
he
also
if
i
sin
again
not
only
death
which
is
an
end
worse
than
sickness
which
was
the
beginning
but
hell
which
is
a
beginning
worse
than
that
end
thy
great
servant
denied
thy
son
and
he
denied
him
again
but
all
before
repentance
here
was
no
relapse
o
if
thou
hadst
ever
readmitted
adam
into
paradise
how
abstinently
would
he
have
walked
by
that
tree
and
would
not
the
angels
that
fell
have
fixed
themselves
upon
thee
if
thou
hadst
once
readmitted
them
to
thy
sight
they
never
relapsed
if
i
do
must
not
my
case
be
as
desperate
not
so
desperate
for
thy
majesty
so
is
thy
both
infinite
and
thou
who
hast
commanded
me
to
pardon
my
brother
times
hast
limited
thyself
to
no
number
if
death
were
ill
in
itself
thou
wouldst
never
have
raised
any
dead
man
to
life
again
because
that
man
must
necessarily
die
again
if
thy
mercy
in
pardoning
did
so
far
aggravate
a
relapse
as
that
there
were
no
more
mercy
after
it
our
case
were
the
worse
for
that
former
mercy
for
who
is
not
under
even
a
necessity
of
sinning
whilst
he
is
here
if
we
place
this
necessity
in
our
own
infirmity
and
not
in
thy
decree
but
i
speak
not
this
o
my
god
as
preparing
a
way
to
my
relapse
out
of
presumption
but
to
preclude
all
accesses
of
desperation
though
out
of
infirmity
i
should
relapse
xxiii
prayer
o
eternal
and
most
gracious
god
who
though
thou
beest
ever
infinite
yet
enlargest
thyself
by
the
number
of
our
prayers
and
takest
our
often
petitions
to
thee
to
be
an
addition
to
thy
glory
and
thy
greatness
as
ever
upon
all
occasions
so
now
o
my
god
i
come
to
thy
majesty
with
two
prayers
two
supplications
i
have
meditated
upon
the
jealousy
which
thou
hast
of
thine
own
honour
and
considered
that
nothing
comes
nearer
a
violating
of
that
honour
nearer
to
the
nature
of
a
scorn
to
thee
than
to
sue
out
thy
pardon
and
receive
the
seals
of
reconciliation
to
thee
and
then
return
to
that
sin
for
which
i
needed
and
had
thy
pardon
before
i
know
that
this
comes
too
near
to
a
making
thy
holy
ordinances
thy
word
thy
sacraments
thy
seals
thy
grace
instruments
of
my
spiritual
fornications
since
therefore
thy
correction
hath
brought
me
to
such
a
participation
of
thyself
thyself
o
my
god
can
not
be
parted
to
such
an
entire
possession
of
thee
as
that
i
durst
deliver
myself
over
to
thee
this
minute
if
this
minute
thou
wouldst
accept
my
dissolution
preserve
me
o
my
god
the
god
of
constancy
and
perseverance
in
this
state
from
all
relapses
into
those
sins
which
have
induced
thy
former
judgments
upon
me
but
because
by
too
lamentable
experience
i
know
how
slippery
my
customs
of
sin
have
made
my
ways
of
sin
i
presume
to
add
this
petition
too
that
if
my
infirmity
overtake
me
thou
forsake
me
not
say
to
my
soul
son
thou
hast
sinned
do
so
no
but
say
also
that
though
i
do
thy
spirit
of
remorse
and
compunction
shall
never
depart
from
me
thy
holy
apostle
paul
was
shipwrecked
thrice
and
yet
still
saved
though
the
rocks
and
the
sands
the
heights
and
the
shallows
the
prosperity
and
the
adversity
of
this
world
do
diversely
threaten
me
though
mine
own
leaks
endanger
me
yet
o
god
let
me
never
put
myself
aboard
with
hymenæus
nor
shipwreck
of
faith
and
a
good
and
then
thy
thy
everlasting
mercy
will
visit
me
though
that
which
i
most
earnestly
pray
against
should
fall
upon
me
a
relapse
into
those
sins
which
i
have
truly
repented
and
thou
hast
fully
pardoned

fitly

respect

not

if
having

remained
nothing

buildings
stand
by
the
benefit
of
their
foundations
that
sustain
and
support
them
and
of
their
buttresses
that

and
embrace
them
and
of
their
contignations
that

the

suffer

the
buttresses
suffer
them
not

and
the
contignation
and
knitting
suffers
them
not
to
cleave
the
body
of
our
building
is
in
the
former
part
of
this
verse
it
is
this
that
is
our
god
is
the
god
of
of
salvations
in
the
plural
so
it
is
in
the
original
the
god
that
gives
us
spiritual
and
temporal
salvation
too
but
of
this
building
the
foundation
the
buttresses
the
contignations
are
in
this
part
of
the
verse
which
constitutes
our
text
and
in
the
three
divers
acceptations
of
the
words
amongst
our
expositors
god
the
lord
belong
the
issues
from
for
first
the
foundation
of
this
building
that
our
god
is
the
god
of
all
salvation
is
laid
in
this
that
this
the
lord
belong
the
issues
of
that
is
it
is
in
his
power
to
give
us
an
issue
and
deliverance
even
then
when
we
are
brought
to
the
jaws
and
teeth
of
death
and
to
the
lips
of
that
whirlpool
the
grave
and
so
in
this
acceptation
this
this
issue
of
death
is
á
a
deliverance
from
death
and
this
is
the
most
obvious
and
most
ordinary
acceptation
of
these
words
and
that
upon
which
our
translation
lays
hold
the
from
and
then
secondly
the
buttresses
that
comprehend
and
settle
this
building
that
he
that
is
our
god
is
the
god
of
all
salvation
are
thus
raised
god
the
lord
belong
the
issues
of
that
is
the
disposition
and
manner
of
our
death
what
kind
of
issue
and
transmigration
we
shall
have
out
of
this
world
whether
prepared
or
sudden
whether
violent
or
natural
whether
in
our
perfect
senses
or
shaken
and
disordered
by
sickness
there
is
no
condemnation
to
be
argued
out
of
that
no
judgment
to
be
made
upon
that
for
howsoever
they
die
in
his
sight
is
the
death
of
his
and
with
him
are
the
issues
of
death
the
ways
of
our
departing
out
of
this
life
are
in
his
hands
and
so
in
this
sense
of
the
words
this
the
issues
of
death
is
in
a
deliverance
in
death
not
that
god
will
deliver
us
from
dying
but
that
he
will
have
a
care
of
us
in
the
hour
of
death
of
what
kind
soever
our
passage
be
and
in
this
sense
and
acceptation
of
the
words
the
natural
frame
and
contexture
doth
well
and
pregnantly
administer
unto
us
and
then
lastly
the
contignation
and
knitting
of
this
building
that
he
that
is
our
god
is
the
god
of
all
salvations
consists
in
this
this
the
lord
belong
the
issues
of
that
is
that
this
god
the
lord
having
united
and
knit
both
natures
in
one
and
being
god
having
also
come
into
this
world
in
our
flesh
he
could
have
no
other
means
to
save
us
he
could
have
no
other
issue
out
of
this
world
nor
return
to
his
former
glory
but
by
death
and
so
in
this
sense
this
this
issue
of
death
is
per
a
deliverance
by
death
by
the
death
of
this
god
our
lord
christ
jesus
and
this
is
saint
augustine
acceptation
of
the
words
and
those
many
and
great
persons
that
have
adhered
to
him
in
all
these
three
lines
then
we
shall
look
upon
these
words
first
as
the
god
of
power
the
almighty
father
rescues
his
servants
from
the
jaws
of
death
and
then
as
the
god
of
mercy
the
glorious
son
rescued
us
by
taking
upon
himself
this
issue
of
death
and
then
between
these
two
as
the
god
of
comfort
the
holy
ghost
rescues
us
from
all
discomfort
by
his
blessed
impressions
beforehand
that
what
manner
of
death
soever
be
ordained
for
us
yet
this
shall
be
in
our
issue
in
death
shall
be
an
entrance
into
everlasting
life
and
these
three
considerations
our
deliverance
morte
in
morte
per
from
death
in
death
and
by
death
will
abundantly
do
all
the
offices
of
the
foundations
of
the
buttresses
of
the
contignation
of
this
our
building
that
he
that
is
our
god
is
the
god
of
all
salvation
because
this
the
lord
belong
the
issues
of
first
then
we
consider
this
to
be
à
that
with
the
lord
are
the
issues
of
and
therefore
in
all
our
death
and
deadly
calamities
of
this
life
we
may
justly
hope
of
a
good
issue
from
him
in
all
our
periods
and
transitions
in
this
life
are
so
many
passages
from
death
to
death
our
very
birth
and
entrance
into
this
life
is
à
an
issue
from
death
for
in
our
mother
womb
we
are
dead
so
as
that
we
do
not
know
we
live
not
so
much
as
we
do
in
our
sleep
neither
is
there
any
grave
so
close
or
so
putrid
a
prison
as
the
womb
would
be
unto
us
if
we
stayed
in
it
beyond
our
time
or
died
there
before
our
time
in
the
grave
the
worms
do
not
kill
us
we
breed
and
feed
and
then
kill
those
worms
which
we
ourselves
produced
in
the
womb
the
dead
child
kills
the
mother
that
conceived
it
and
is
a
murderer
nay
a
parricide
even
after
it
is
dead
and
if
we
be
not
dead
so
in
the
womb
so
as
that
being
dead
we
kill
her
that
gave
us
our
first
life
our
life
of
vegetation
yet
we
are
dead
so
as
david
idols
are
dead
in
the
womb
we
have
and
see
not
ears
and
hear
there
in
the
womb
we
are
fitted
for
works
of
darkness
all
the
while
deprived
of
light
and
there
in
the
womb
we
are
taught
cruelty
by
being
fed
with
blood
and
may
be
damned
though
we
be
never
born
of
our
very
making
in
the
womb
david
says
am
wonderfully
and
fearfully
and
knowledge
is
too
excellent
for
for
even
that
the
lord
doing
and
it
is
wonderful
in
our
ipse
fecit
nos
is
he
that
made
us
and
not
we
nor
our
parents
neither
hands
have
made
and
fashioned
me
round
saith
job
as
the
original
word
is
hast
taken
pains
about
me
and
says
he
dost
destroy
though
i
be
the
masterpiece
of
the
greatest
master
man
is
so
yet
if
thou
do
no
more
for
me
if
thou
leave
me
where
thou
madest
me
destruction
will
follow
the
womb
which
should
be
the
house
of
life
becomes
death
itself
if
god
leave
us
there
that
which
god
threatens
so
often
the
shutting
of
a
womb
is
not
so
heavy
nor
so
discomfortable
a
curse
in
the
first
as
in
the
latter
shutting
nor
in
the
shutting
of
barrenness
as
in
the
shutting
of
weakness
when
are
come
to
the
birth
and
no
strength
to
bring
it
is
the
exaltation
of
misery
to
fall
from
a
near
hope
of
happiness
and
in
that
vehement
imprecation
the
prophet
expresses
the
highest
of
god
anger
them
o
lord
what
wilt
thou
give
them
give
them
a
miscarrying
therefore
as
soon
as
we
are
men
that
is
inanimated
quickened
in
the
womb
though
we
can
not
ourselves
our
parents
have
to
say
in
our
behalf
man
that
he
is
who
shall
deliver
him
from
this
body
of
death
if
there
be
no
deliverer
it
must
be
he
that
said
to
jeremiah
i
formed
thee
i
knew
thee
and
before
thou
camest
out
of
the
womb
i
sanctified
we
are
not
sure
that
there
was
no
kind
of
ship
nor
boat
to
fish
in
nor
to
pass
by
till
god
prescribed
noah
that
absolute
form
of
the
ark
that
word
which
the
holy
ghost
by
moses
useth
for
the
ark
is
common
to
all
kind
of
boats
and
is
the
same
word
that
moses
useth
for
the
boat
that
he
was
exposed
in
that
his
mother
laid
him
in
an
ark
of
bulrushes
but
we
are
sure
that
eve
had
no
midwife
when
she
was
delivered
of
cain
therefore
she
might
well
say
virum
à
domino
i
have
gotten
a
man
from
the
wholly
entirely
from
the
lord
it
is
the
lord
that
enabled
me
to
conceive
the
lord
that
infused
a
quickening
soul
into
that
conception
the
lord
that
brought
into
the
world
that
which
himself
had
quickened
without
all
this
might
eve
say
my
body
had
been
but
the
house
of
death
and
domini
sunt
exitus
mortis
to
god
the
lord
belong
the
issues
of
but
then
this
à
is
but
in
this
issue
this
deliverance
from
that
death
the
death
of
the
womb
is
an
entrance
a
delivering
over
to
another
death
the
manifold
deaths
of
this
world
we
have
a
in
our
mother
womb
which
grows
with
us
from
our
conception
and
we
come
into
the
world
wound
up
in
that
for
we
come
to
seek
a
grave
and
as
prisoners
discharged
of
actions
may
lie
for
fees
so
when
the
womb
hath
discharged
us
yet
we
are
bound
to
it
by
cords
of
hestæ
by
such
a
string
as
that
we
can
not
go
thence
nor
stay
there
we
celebrate
our
own
funerals
with
cries
even
at
our
birth
as
though
our
threescore
and
ten
years
life
were
spent
in
our
mother
labour
and
our
circle
made
up
in
the
first
point
thereof
we
beg
our
baptism
with
another
sacrament
with
tears
and
we
come
into
a
world
that
lasts
many
ages
but
we
last
not
domo
says
our
saviour
speaking
of
heaven
divers
and
durable
so
that
if
a
man
can
not
possess
a
martyr
house
he
hath
shed
no
blood
for
christ
yet
he
may
have
a
confessor
he
hath
been
ready
to
glorify
god
in
the
shedding
of
his
blood
and
if
a
woman
can
not
possess
a
virgin
house
she
hath
embraced
the
holy
state
of
marriage
yet
she
may
have
a
matron

she
hath
brought
forth
and
brought
up
children
in
the
fear
of
god

here
upon

the
of

hath
not
where
to
lay
his
saith
he
himself
terram
dedit
filiis
hominum
how
then
hath
god
given
this
earth
to
the
sons
of
men
he
hath
given
them
earth
for
their
materials
to
be
made
of
earth
and
he
hath
given
them
earth
for
their
grave
and
sepulchre
to
return
and
resolve
to
earth
but
not
for
their
possession
we
have
no
continuing
nay
no
cottage
that
continues
nay
no
persons
no
bodies
that
continue
whatsoever
moved
saint
jerome
to
call
the
journeys
of
the
israelites
in
the
wilderness
mansions
the
word
the
word
is
signifies
but
a
journey
but
a
peregrination
even
the
israel
of
god
hath
no
mansions
but
journeys
pilgrimages
in
this
life
by
what
measure
did
jacob
measure
his
life
to
pharaoh
days
of
the
years
of
my
and
though
the
apostle
would
not
say
that
whilst
we
are
in
the
body
we
are
dead
yet
he
says
whilst
we
are
in
the
body
we
are
but
in
a
pilgrimage
and
we
are
from
the
he
might
have
said
dead
for
this
whole
world
is
but
an
universal
churchyard
but
our
common
grave
and
the
life
and
motion
that
the
greatest
persons
have
in
it
is
but
as
the
shaking
of
buried
bodies
in
their
grave
by
an
earthquake
that
which
we
call
life
is
but
a
week
of
death
seven
days
seven
periods
of
our
life
spent
in
dying
a
dying
seven
times
over
and
there
is
an
end
our
birth
dies
in
infancy
and
our
infancy
dies
in
youth
and
youth
and
the
rest
die
in
age
and
age
also
dies
and
determines
all
nor
do
all
these
youth
out
of
infancy
or
age
out
of
youth
arise
so
as
the
phoenix
out
of
the
ashes
of
another
phoenix
formerly
dead
but
as
a
wasp
or
a
serpent
out
of
a
carrion
or
as
a
snake
out
of
dung
our
youth
is
worse
than
our
infancy
and
our
age
worse
than
our
youth
our
youth
is
hungry
and
thirsty
after
those
sins
which
our
infancy
knew
not
and
our
age
is
sorry
and
angry
that
it
can
not
pursue
those
sins
which
our
youth
did
and
besides
all
the
way
so
many
deaths
that
is
so
many
deadly
calamities
accompany
every
condition
and
every
period
of
this
life
as
that
death
itself
would
be
an
ease
to
them
that
suffer
them
upon
this
sense
doth
job
wish
that
god
had
not
given
him
an
issue
from
the
first
death
from
the
womb
thou
hast
brought
me
forth
out
of
the
womb
oh
that
i
had
given
up
the
ghost
and
no
eye
seen
me
i
should
have
been
as
though
i
had
not
and
not
only
the
impatient
israelites
in
their
murmuring
to
god
we
had
died
by
the
hand
of
the
lord
in
the
land
of
but
elijah
himself
when
he
fled
from
jezebel
and
went
for
his
life
as
that
text
says
under
the
juniper
tree
requested
that
he
might
die
and
said
is
enough
now
o
lord
take
away
my
so
jonah
justifies
his
impatience
nay
his
anger
towards
god
himself
o
lord
take
i
beseech
thee
my
life
from
me
for
it
is
better
to
die
than
to
and
when
god
asked
him
thou
well
to
be
angry
for
this
he
replies
do
well
to
be
angry
even
unto
how
much
worse
a
death
than
death
is
this
life
which
so
good
men
would
so
often
change
for
death
but
if
my
case
be
as
saint
paul
case
that
i
die
daily
that
something
heavier
than
death
fall
upon
me
every
day
if
my
case
be
david
case
die
mortificamur
all
the
day
long
we
are
that
not
only
every
day
but
every
hour
of
the
day
something
heavier
than
death
fall
upon
me
though
that
be
true
of
me
in
peccatis
i
was
shapen
in
iniquity
and
in
sin
did
my
mother
conceive
there
i
died
one
death
though
that
be
true
of
me
filius
i
was
born
not
only
the
child
of
sin
but
the
child
of
wrath
of
the
wrath
of
god
for
sin
which
is
a
heavier
death
yet
domini
sunt
exitus
mortis
with
god
the
lord
are
the
issues
of
and
after
a
job
and
a
joseph
and
a
jeremiah
and
a
daniel
i
can
not
doubt
of
a
deliverance
and
if
no
other
deliverance
conduce
more
to
his
glory
and
my
good
yet
he
hath
the
keys
of
death
and
he
can
let
me
out
at
that
door
that
is
deliver
me
from
the
manifold
deaths
of
this
world
the
and
the
the
every
day
death
and
every
hour
death
by
that
one
death
the
final
dissolution
of
body
and
soul
the
end
of
all
but
then
is
that
the
end
of
all
is
that
dissolution
of
body
and
soul
the
last
death
that
the
body
shall
suffer
for
of
spiritual
death
we
speak
not
now
it
is
not
though
this
be
à
it
is
in
though
it
be
an
issue
from
manifold
deaths
of
this
world
yet
it
is
an
entrance
into
the
death
of
corruption
and
putrefaction
and
vermiculation
and
incineration
and
dispersion
in
and
from
the
grave
in
which
every
dead
man
dies
over
again
it
was
a
prerogative
peculiar
to
christ
not
to
die
this
death
not
to
see
corruption
what
gave
him
this
privilege
not
joseph
great
proportion
of
gums
and
spices
that
might
have
preserved
his
body
from
corruption
and
incineration
longer
than
he
needed
it
longer
than
three
days
but
it
would
not
have
done
it
for
ever
what
preserved
him
then
did
his
exemption
and
freedom
from
original
sin
preserve
him
from
this
corruption
and
incineration
it
is
true
that
original
sin
hath
induced
this
corruption
and
incineration
upon
us
if
we
had
not
sinned
in
adam
had
not
put
on
as
the
apostle
speaks
nor
had
not
put
on
but
we
had
had
our
transmigration
from
this
to
the
other
world
without
any
mortality
any
corruption
at
all
but
yet
since
christ
took
sin
upon
him
so
far
as
made
him
mortal
he
had
it
so
far
too
as
might
have
made
him
see
this
corruption
and
incineration
though
he
had
no
original
sin
in
himself
what
preserved
him
then
did
the
hypostatical
union
of
both
natures
god
and
man
preserve
him
from
this
corruption
and
incineration
it
is
true
that
this
was
a
most
powerful
embalming
to
be
embalmed
with
the
divine
nature
itself
to
be
embalmed
with
eternity
was
able
to
preserve
him
from
corruption
and
incineration
for
ever
and
he
was
embalmed
so
embalmed
with
the
divine
nature
itself
even
in
his
body
as
well
as
in
his
soul
for
the
godhead
the
divine
nature
did
not
depart
but
remained
still
united
to
his
dead
body
in
the
grave
but
yet
for
all
this
powerful
embalming
his
hypostatical
union
of
both
natures
we
see
christ
did
die
and
for
all
his
union
which
made
him
god
and
man
he
became
no
man
for
the
union
of
the
body
and
soul
makes
the
man
and
he
whose
soul
and
body
are
separated
by
death
as
long
as
that
state
lasts
is
properly
no
man
and
therefore
as
in
him
the
dissolution
of
body
and
soul
was
no
dissolution
of
the
hypostatical
union
so
there
is
nothing
that
constrains
us
to
say
that
though
the
flesh
of
christ
had
seen
corruption
and
incineration
in
the
grave
this
had
not
been
any
dissolution
of
the
hypostatical
union
for
the
divine
nature
the
godhead
might
have
remained
with
all
the
elements
and
principles
of
christ
body
as
well
as
it
did
with
the
two
constitutive
parts
of
his
person
his
body
and
his
soul
this
incorruption
then
was
not
in
joseph
gums
and
spices
nor
was
it
in
christ
innocency
and
exemption
from
original
sin
nor
was
it
that
is
it
is
not
necessary
to
say
it
was
in
the
hypostatical
union
but
this
incorruptibleness
of
his
flesh
is
most
conveniently
placed
in
that
dabis
thou
wilt
not
suffer
thy
holy
one
to
see
we
look
no
further
for
causes
or
reasons
in
the
mysteries
of
religion
but
to
the
will
and
pleasure
of
god
christ
himself
limited
his
inquisition
in
that
est
even
so
father
for
so
it
seemeth
good
in
thy
christ
body
did
not
see
corruption
therefore
because
god
had
decreed
it
should
not
the
humble
soul
and
only
the
humble
soul
is
the
religious
soul
rests
himself
upon
god
purposes
and
the
decrees
of
god
which
he
hath
declared
and
manifested
not
such
as
are
conceived
and
imagined
in
ourselves
though
upon
some
probability
some
verisimilitude
so
in
our
present
case
peter
proceeds
in
his
sermon
at
jerusalem
and
so
paul
in
his
at
antioch
they
preached
christ
to
have
been
risen
without
seeing
corruption
not
only
because
god
had
decreed
it
but
because
he
had
manifested
that
decree
in
his
prophet
therefore
doth
saint
paul
cite
by
special
number
the
second
psalm
for
that
decree
and
therefore
both
saint
peter
and
saint
paul
cite
for
it
that
place
in
the
sixteenth
psalm
for
when
god
declares
his
decree
and
purpose
in
the
express
words
of
his
prophet
or
when
he
declares
it
in
the
real
execution
of
the
decree
then
he
makes
it
ours
then
he
manifests
it
to
us
and
therefore
as
the
mysteries
of
our
religion
are
not
the
objects
of
our
reason
but
by
faith
we
rest
on
god
decree
and
purpose
it
is
so
o
god
because
it
is
thy
will
it
should
be
so
so
god
decrees
are
ever
to
be
considered
in
the
manifestation
thereof
all
manifestation
is
either
in
the
word
of
god
or
in
the
execution
of
the
decree
and
when
these
two
concur
and
meet
it
is
the
strongest
demonstration
that
can
be
when
therefore
i
find
those
marks
of
adoption
and
spiritual
filiation
which
are
delivered
in
the
word
of
god
to
be
upon
me
when
i
find
that
real
execution
of
his
good
purpose
upon
me
as
that
actually
i
do
live
under
the
obedience
and
under
the
conditions
which
are
evidences
of
adoption
and
spiritual
filiation
then
so
long
as
i
see
these
marks
and
live
so
i
may
safely
comfort
myself
in
a
holy
certitude
and
a
modest
infallibility
of
my
adoption
christ
determines
himself
in
that
the
purpose
of
god
was
manifest
to
him
saint
peter
and
saint
paul
determine
themselves
in
those
two
ways
of
knowing
the
purpose
of
god
the
word
of
god
before
the
execution
of
the
decree
in
the
fulness
of
time
it
was
prophesied
before
said
they
and
it
is
performed
now
christ
is
risen
without
seeing
corruption
now
this
which
is
so
singularly
peculiar
to
him
that
his
flesh
should
not
see
corruption
at
his
second
coming
his
coming
to
judgment
shall
extend
to
all
that
are
then
alive
their
hestæ
shall
not
see
corruption
because
as
the
apostle
says
and
says
as
a
secret
as
a
mystery
i
shew
you
a
mystery
we
shall
not
all
that
is
not
continue
in
the
state
of
the
dead
in
the
grave
we
shall
all
be
changed
in
an
we
shall
have
a
dissolution
and
in
the
same
instant
a
redintegration
a
recompacting
of
body
and
soul
and
that
shall
be
truly
a
death
and
truly
a
resurrection
but
no
sleeping
in
corruption
but
for
us
that
die
now
and
sleep
in
the
state
of
the
dead
we
must
all
pass
this
posthume
death
this
death
after
death
nay
this
death
after
burial
this
dissolution
after
dissolution
this
death
of
corruption
and
putrefaction
of
vermiculation
and
incineration
of
dissolution
and
dispersion
in
and
from
the
grave
when
these
bodies
that
have
been
the
children
of
royal
parents
and
the
parents
of
royal
children
must
say
with
job
thou
art
my
father
and
to
the
worm
thou
art
my
mother
and
my
miserable
riddle
when
the
same
worm
must
be
my
mother
and
my
sister
and
myself
miserable
incest
when
i
must
be
married
to
my
mother
and
my
sister
and
be
both
father
and
mother
to
my
own
mother
and
sister
beget
and
bear
that
worm
which
is
all
that
miserable
penury
when
my
mouth
shall
be
filled
with
dust
and
the
shall
feed
and
feed
upon
me
when
the
ambitious
man
shall
have
no
satisfaction
if
the
poorest
alive
tread
upon
him
nor
the
poorest
receive
any
contentment
in
being
made
equal
to
princes
for
they
shall
be
equal
but
in
dust
dieth
at
his
full
strength
being
wholly
at
ease
and
in
quiet
and
another
dies
in
the
bitterness
of
his
soul
and
never
eats
with
but
lie
down
alike
in
the
dust
and
the
worm
covers
in
job
and
in
isaiah
it
covers
them
and
is
spread
under
them
worm
is
spread
under
thee
and
the
worm
covers
there
are
the
mats

the
carpets
that
lie
under

there
are
the

the

of
men
even
those
bodies
that
were
temples
of
the
holy
come
to
this
dilapidation
to
ruin
to
rubbish
to
dust
even
the
israel
of
the
lord
and
jacob
himself
hath
no
other
specification
no
other
denomination
but
that
thou
worm
of
jacob
truly
the
consideration
of
this
posthume
death
this
death
after
burial
that
after
god
with
whom
are
the
issues
of
death
hath
delivered
me
from
the
death
of
the
womb
by
bringing
me
into
the
world
and
from
the
manifold
deaths
of
the
world
by
laying
me
in
the
grave
i
must
die
again
in
an
incineration
of
this
flesh
and
in
a
dispersion
of
that
dust
that
that
monarch
who
spread
over
many
nations
alive
must
in
his
dust
lie
in
a
corner
of
that
sheet
of
lead
and
there
but
so
long
as
that
lead
will
last
and
that
private
and
retired
man
that
thought
himself
his
own
for
ever
and
never
came
forth
must
in
his
dust
of
the
grave
be
published
and
such
are
the
revolutions
of
the
grave
be
mingled
with
the
dust
of
every
highway
and
of
every
dunghill
and
swallowed
in
every
puddle
and
pond
this
is
the
most
inglorious
and
contemptible
vilification
the
most
deadly
and
peremptory
nullification
of
man
that
we
can
consider
god
seems
to
have
carried
the
declaration
of
his
power
to
a
great
height
when
he
sets
the
prophet
ezekiel
in
the
valley
of
dry
bones
and
says
of
man
can
these
bones
live
as
though
it
had
been
impossible
and
yet
they
did
the
lord
laid
upon
them
and
flesh
and
breathed
into
them
and
they
did
but
in
that
case
there
were
bones
to
be
seen
something
visible
of
which
it
might
be
said
can
this
thing
live
but
in
this
death
of
incineration
and
dispersion
of
dust
we
see
nothing
that
we
call
that
man
if
we
say
can
this
dust
live
perchance
it
can
not
it
may
be
the
mere
dust
of
the
earth
which
never
did
live
never
shall
it
may
be
the
dust
of
that
man
worm
which
did
live
but
shall
no
more
it
may
be
the
dust
of
another
man
that
concerns
not
him
of
whom
it
was
asked
this
death
of
incineration
and
dispersion
is
to
natural
reason
the
most
irrecoverable
death
of
all
and
yet
domini
sunt
exitus
mortis
unto
god
the
lord
belong
the
issues
of
and
by
recompacting
this
dust
into
the
same
body
and
remaining
the
same
body
with
the
same
soul
he
shall
in
a
blessed
and
glorious
resurrection
give
me
such
an
issue
from
this
death
as
shall
never
pass
into
any
other
death
but
establish
me
into
a
life
that
shall
last
as
long
as
the
lord
of
life
himself
and
so
have
you
that
that
belongs
to
the
first
acceptation
of
these
words
god
the
lord
belong
the
issues
of
that
though
from
the
womb
to
the
grave
and
in
the
grave
itself
we
pass
from
death
to
death
yet
as
daniel
speaks
lord
our
god
is
able
to
deliver
us
and
he
will
deliver
and
so
we
pass
unto
our
second
accommodation
of
these
words
god
the
lord
belong
the
issues
of
that
it
belongs
to
god
and
not
to
man
to
pass
a
judgment
upon
us
at
our
death
or
to
conclude
a
dereliction
on
god
part
upon
the
manner
thereof
those
indications
which
the
physicians
receive
and
those
presagitions
which
they
give
for
death
or
recovery
in
the
patient
they
receive
and
they
give
out
of
the
grounds
and
the
rules
of
their
art
but
we
have
no
such
rule
or
art
to
give
a
presagition
of
spiritual
death
and
damnation
upon
any
such
indication
as
we
see
in
any
dying
man
we
see
often
enough
to
be
sorry
but
not
to
despair
we
may
be
deceived
both
ways
we
use
to
comfort
ourself
in
the
death
of
a
friend
if
it
be
testified
that
he
went
away
like
a
lamb
that
is
without
any
reluctation
but
god
knows
that
may
be
accompanied
with
a
dangerous
damp
and
stupefaction
and
insensibility
of
his
present
state
our
blessed
saviour
suffered
colluctations
with
death
and
a
even
in
his
soul
to
and
an
agony
even
to
a
bloody
sweat
in
his
body
and
expostulations
with
god
and
exclamations
upon
the
cross
he
was
a
devout
man
who
said
upon
his
or
for
he
was
a
hermit
annos
domino
servivisti
et

times
hast
thou
served
a
good
master
threescore
and
ten
years
and
now
art
thou
loth
to
go
into
his
presence
yet
hilarion

barlaam
was
a
devout
man
a
hermit
too
that
said
that
day
he
died
te

consider
this
to
be
the
first
day
service
that
ever
thou
didst
thy
master
to
glorify
him
in
a
christianly
and
a
constant
death
and
if
thy
first
day
be
thy
last
day
too
how
soon
dost
thou
come
to
receive
thy
wages
yet
barlaam
could
have
been
content
to
have
stayed
longer
forth
make
no
ill
conclusions
upon
any
man
lothness
to
die
for
the
mercies
of
god
work
momentarily
in
minutes
and
many
times
insensibly
to
bystanders
or
any
other
than
the
party
departing
and
then
upon
violent
deaths
inflicted
as
upon
malefactors
christ
himself
hath
forbidden
us
by
his
own
death
to
make
any
ill
conclusion
for
his
own
death
had
those
impressions
in
it
he
was
reputed
he
was
executed
as
a
malefactor
and
no
doubt
many
of
them
who
concurred
to
his
death
did
believe
him
to
be
so
of
sudden
death
there
are
scarce
examples
be
found
in
the
scriptures
upon
good
men
for
death
in
battle
can
not
be
called
sudden
death
but
god
governs
not
by
examples
but
by
rules
and
therefore
make
no
ill
conclusion
upon
sudden
death
nor
upon
distempers
neither
though
perchance
accompanied
with
some
words
of
diffidence
and
distrust
in
the
mercies
of
god
the
tree
lies
as
it
falls
it
is
true
but
it
is
not
the
last
stroke
that
fells
the
tree
nor
the
last
word
nor
gasp
that
qualifies
the
soul
still
pray
we
for
a
peaceable
life
against
violent
death
and
for
time
of
repentance
against
sudden
death
and
for
sober
and
modest
assurance
against
distempered
and
diffident
death
but
never
make
ill
conclusions
upon
persons
overtaken
with
such
deaths
domini
sunt
exitus
mortis
to
god
the
lord
belong
the
issues
of
and
he
received
samson
who
went
out
of
this
world
in
such
a
manner
consider
it
actively
consider
it
passively
in
his
own
death
and
in
those
whom
he
slew
with
himself
as
was
subject
to
interpretation
hard
enough
yet
the
holy
ghost
hath
moved
saint
paul
to
celebrate
samson
in
his
great
catalogue
and
so
doth
all
the
church
our
critical
day
is
not
the
very
day
of
our
death
but
the
whole
course
of
our
life
i
thank
him
that
prays
for
me
when
the
bell
tolls
but
i
thank
him
much
more
that
catechises
me
or
preaches
to
me
or
instructs
me
how
to
live
hoc
et
there
is
my
security
the
mouth
of
the
lord
hath
said
it
this
and
thou
shalt
but
though
i
do
it
yet
i
shall
die
too
die
a
bodily
a
natural
death
but
god
never
mentions
never
seems
to
consider
that
death
the
bodily
the
natural
death
god
doth
not
say
live
well
and
thou
shalt
die
well
that
is
an
easy
a
quiet
death
but
live
well
here
and
thou
shalt
live
well
for
ever
as
the
first
part
of
a
sentence
pieces
well
with
the
last
and
never
respects
never
hearkens
after
the
parenthesis
that
comes
between
so
doth
a
good
life
here
flow
into
an
eternal
life
without
any
consideration
what
manner
of
death
we
die
but
whether
the
gate
of
my
prison
be
opened
with
an
oiled
key
by
a
gentle
and
preparing
sickness
or
the
gate
be
hewn
down
by
a
violent
death
or
the
gate
be
burnt
down
by
a
raging
and
frantic
fever
a
gate
into
heaven
i
shall
have
for
from
the
lord
is
the
cause
of
my
life
and
god
the
lord
are
the
issues
of
and
further
we
carry
not
this
second
acceptation
of
the
words
as
this
of
is
in
god
care
that
the
soul
be
safe
what
agonies
soever
the
body
suffers
in
the
hour
of
death
but
pass
to
our
third
part
and
last
part
as
this
issue
of
death
is
per
a
deliverance
by
the
death
of
another
job
audiisti
et
vidisti
finem
says
saint
james
have
heard
of
the
patience
of
says
he
all
this
while
you
have
done
that
for
in
every
man
calamitous
miserable
man
a
job
speaks
now
the
end
of
the
sayeth
that
apostle
which
is
not
that
end
that
the
lord
proposed
to
himself
salvation
to
us
nor
the
end
which
he
proposes
to
us
conformity
to
him
but
the
end
of
the
says
he
the
end
that
the
lord
himself
came
to
death
and
a
painful
and
a
shameful
death
but
why
did
he
die
and
why
die
so
domini
domini
sunt
exitus
as
saint
augustine
interpreting
this
text
answers
that
question
because
to
this
our
lord
belonged
the
issues
of
death
quid
apertius
diceretur
says
he
there
what
can
be
more
obvious
more
manifest
than
this
sense
of
these
words
in
the
former
part
of
this
verse
it
is
said
he
that
is
god
is
the
god
of
salvation
deus
salvos
so
he
reads
it
the
god
that
must
save
us
who
can
that
be
says
he
but
jesus
for
therefore
that
name
was
given
him
because
he
was
to
save
us
and
to
this
jesus
says
he
this
saviour
the
issues
of
oportuit
eum
de
hac
vita
alios
exitus
habere
quam
being
come
into
this
life
in
our
mortal
nature
he
could
not
go
out
of
this
life
any
other
way
but
by
death
says
he
therefore
it
is
said
god
the
lord
belonged
the
issues
of
death
ut
ostenderetur
moriendo
nos
salvos
to
show
that
his
way
to
save
us
was
to
die
and
from
this
text
doth
saint
isidore
prove
that
christ
was
truly
man
which
as
many
sects
of
heretics
denied
as
that
he
was
truly
god
because
to
him
though
he
were
as
the
text
doubles
it
god
the
lord
yet
to
to
god
the
lord
belonged
the
issues
of
eum
more
can
not
be
said
than
christ
himself
says
of
himself
things
christ
ought
to
he
had
no
other
way
but
death
so
then
this
part
of
our
sermon
must
needs
be
a
passion
sermon
since
all
his
life
was
a
continual
passion
all
our
lent
may
well
be
a
continual
good
friday
christ
painful
life
took
off
none
of
the
pains
of
his
death
he
felt
not
the
less
then
for
having
felt
so
much
before
nor
will
any
thing
that
shall
be
said
before
lessen
but
rather
enlarge
the
devotion
to
that
which
shall
be
said
of
his
passion
at
the
time
of
due
solemnization
thereof
christ
bled
not
a
drop
the
less
at
the
last
for
having
bled
at
his
circumcision
before
nor
will
you
a
tear
the
less
then
if
you
shed
some
now
and
therefore
be
now
content
to
consider
with
me
how
this
god
the
lord
belonged
the
issues
of
that
god
this
lord
the
lord
of
life
could
die
is
a
strange
contemplation
that
the
red
sea
could
be
dry
that
the
sun
could
stand
still
that
an
oven
could
be
seven
times
heat
and
not
burn
that
lions
could
be
hungry
and
not
bite
is
strange
miraculously
strange
but
that
god
die
but
that
god
die
is
an
exaltation
of
that
but
even
of
that
also
it
is
a
that
god
should
die
must
die
and
said
saint
augustine
god
the
lord
had
no
issue
but
by
death
and
says
christ
himself
all
this
christ
ought
to
suffer
was
bound
to
suffer
ultimo
says
david
god
is
the
god
of
revenges
he
would
not
pass
over
the
son
of
man
unrevenged
unpunished
but
then
ultionum
libere
says
that
place
the
god
of
revenges
works
freely
he
punishes
he
spares
whom
he
will
and
would
he
not
spare
himself
he
would
not
fortis
ut
mors
love
is
strong
as
stronger
it
drew
in
death
that
naturally
is
not
welcome
says
christ
it
be
possible
let
this
cup
when
his
love
expressed
in
a
former
decree
with
his
father
had
made
it
impossible
waters
quench
not
christ
tried
many
he
was
baptised
out
of
his
love
and
his
love
determined
not
there
he
mingled
blood
with
water
in
his
agony
and
that
determined
not
his
love
he
wept
pure
blood
all
his
blood
at
all
his
eyes
at
all
his
pores
in
his
flagellation
and
thorns
the
lord
our
god
belonged
the
issues
of
and
these
expressed
but
these
did
not
quench
his
love
he
would
not
spare
nay
he
could
not
spare
himself
there
was
nothing
more
free
more
voluntary
more
spontaneous
than
the
death
of
christ
it
is
true
he
died
voluntarily
but
yet
when
we
consider
the
contract
that
had
passed
between
his
father
and
him
there
was
an
a
kind
of
necessity
upon
him
all
this
ought
to
and
when
shall
we
date
this
obligation
this
this
necessity
when
shall
we
say
that
began
certainly
this
decree
by
which
christ
was
to
suffer
all
this
was
an
eternal
decree
and
was
there
any
thing
before
that
that
was
eternal
infinite
love
eternal
love
be
pleased
to
follow
this
home
and
to
consider
it
seriously
that
what
liberty
soever
we
can
conceive
in
christ
to
die
or
not
to
die
this
necessity
of
dying
this
decree
is
as
eternal
as
that
liberty
and
yet
how
small
a
matter
made
he
of
this
necessity
and
this
dying
his
father
calls
it
but
a
bruise
and
but
a
bruising
of
his
heel
the
serpent
shall
bruise
his
heel
and
yet
that
was
that
the
serpent
should
practise
and
compass
his
death
himself
calls
it
but
a
baptism
as
though
he
were
to
be
the
better
for
it
i
a
baptism
to
be
baptised
and
he
was
in
pain
till
it
was
accomplished
and
yet
this
baptism
was
his
death
the
holy
ghost
calls
it
joy
the
joy
which
was
set
before
him
he
endured
the
which
was
not
a
joy
of
his
reward
after
his
passion
but
a
joy
that
filled
him
even
in
the
midst
of
his
torments
and
arose
from
him
when
christ
calls
his
a
cup
and
no
worse
ye
drink
of
my
he
speaks
not
odiously
not
with
detestation
of
it
indeed
it
was
a
cup
a
health
to
all
the
world
and
says
david
shall
i
render
to
the
lord
answer
you
with
david
calicem
i
will
take
the
cup
of
take
it
that
cup
is
salvation
his
passion
if
not
into
your
present
imitation
yet
into
your
present
contemplation
and
behold
how
that
lord
that
was
god
yet
could
die
would
die
must
die
for
our
salvation
that
moses
and
elias
talked
with
christ
in
the
transfiguration
both
saint
matthew
and
saint
mark
tells
us
but
what
they
talked
of
only
saint
luke
excessum
says
he
talked
of
his
disease
of
his
death
which
was
to
be
accomplished
at
the
word
is
of
his
the
very
word
of
our
text
his
by
moses
who
in
his
exodus
had
prefigured
this
issue
of
our
lord
and
in
passing
israel
out
of
egypt
through
the
red
sea
had
foretold
in
that
actual
prophecy
christ
passing
of
mankind
through
the
sea
of
his
blood
and
elias
whose
exodus
and
issue
of
this
world
was
a
figure
of
christ
ascension
had
no
doubt
a
great
satisfaction
in
talking
with
our
blessed
lord
excessu
of
the
full
consummation
of
all
this
in
his
death
which
was
to
be
accomplished
at
jerusalem
our
meditation
of
his
death
should
be
more
visceral
and
affect
us
more
because
it
is
of
a
thing
already
done
the
ancient
romans
had
a
certain
tenderness
and
detestation
of
the
name
of
death
they
could
not
name
death
no
not
in
their
wills
there
they
could
not
say
mori
but
quid
humanitas
not
if
or
when
i
die
but
when
the
course
of
nature
is
accomplished
upon
me
to
us
that
speak
daily
of
the
death
of
christ
he
was
crucified
dead
and
buried
can
the
memory
or
the
mention
of
our
own
death
be
irksome
or
bitter
there
are
in
these
latter
times
amongst
us
that
name
death
freely
enough
and
the
death
of
god
but
in
blasphemous
oaths
and
execrations
miserable
men
who
shall
therefore
be
said
never
to
have
named
jesus
because
they
have
named
him
too
often
and
therefore
hear
jesus
say
vos
i
never
knew
because
they
made
themselves
too
familiar
with
him
moses
and
elias
talked
with
christ
of
his
death
only
in
a
holy
and
joyful
sense
of
the
benefit
which
they
and
all
the
world
were
to
receive
by
that
discourses
of
religion
should
not
be
out
of
curiosity
but
to
edification
and
then
they
talked
with
christ
of
his
death
at
that
time
when
he
was
in
the
greatest
height
of
glory
that
ever
he
admitted
in
this
world
that
is
his
transfiguration
and
we
are
afraid
to
speak
to
the
great
men
of
this
world
of
their
death
but
nourish
in
them
a
vain
imagination
of
immortality
and
immutability
but
est
nobis
esse
as
saint
peter
said
there
is
good
to
dwell
in
this
consideration
of
his
death
and
therefore
transfer
we
our
tabernacle
our
devotions
through
some
of
those
steps
which
god
the
lord
made
to
his
of
that
day
take
in
the
whole
day
from
the
hour
that
christ
received
the
passover
upon
thursday
unto
the
hour
in
which
he
died
the
next
day
make
this
present
day
that
day
in
thy
devotion
and
consider
what
he
did
and
remember
what
you
have
done
before
he
instituted
and
celebrated
the
sacrament
which
was
after
the
eating
of
the
passover
he
proceeded
to
that
act
of
humility
to
wash
his
disciples
feet
even
peter
who
for
a
while
resisted
him
in
thy
preparation
to
the
holy
and
blessed
sacrament
hast
thou
with
a
sincere
humility
sought
a
reconciliation
with
all
the
world
even
with
those
that
have
been
averse
from
it
and
refused
that
reconciliation
from
thee
if
so
and
not
else
thou
hast
spent
that
first
part
of
his
last
day
in
a
conformity
with
him
after
the
sacrament
he
spent
the
time
till
night
in
prayer
in
preaching
in
psalms
hast
thou
considered
that
a
worthy
receiving
of
the
sacrament
consists
in
a
continuation
of
holiness
after
as
well
as
in
a
preparation
before
if
so
thou
hast
therein
also
conformed
thyself
to
him
so
christ
spent
his
time
till
night
at
night
he
went
into
the
garden
to
pray
and
he
prayed
prolixious
he
spent
much
time
in
prayer
how
much
because
it
is
literally
expressed
that
he
prayed
there
three
several
times
and
that
returning
to
his
disciples
after
his
first
prayer
and
finding
them
asleep
said
ye
not
watch
with
me
one
it
is
collected
that
he
spent
three
hours
in
prayer
i
dare
scarce
ask
thee
whither
thou
wentest
or
how
thou
disposedst
of
thyself
when
it
grew
dark
and
after
last
night
if
that
time
were
spent
in
a
holy
recommendation
of
thyself
to
god
and
a
submission
of
thy
will
to
his
it
was
spent
in
a
conformity
to
him
in
that
time
and
in
those
prayers
was
his
agony
and
bloody
sweat
i
will
hope
that
thou
didst
pray
but
not
every
ordinary
and
customary
prayer
but
prayer
actually
accompanied
with
shedding
of
tears
and
dispositively
in
a
readiness
to
shed
blood
for
his
glory
in
necessary
cases
puts
thee
into
a
conformity
with
him
about
midnight
he
was
taken
and
bound
with
a
kiss
art
thou
not
too
conformable
to
him
in
that
is
not
that
too
literally
too
exactly
thy
case
at
midnight
to
have
been
taken
and
bound
with
a
kiss
from
thence
he
was
carried
back
to
jerusalem
first
to
annas
then
to
caiaphas
and
as
late
as
it
was
then
he
was
examined
and
buffeted
and
delivered
over
to
the
custody
of
those
officers
from
whom
he
received
all
those
irrisions
and
violences
the
covering
of
his
face
the
spitting
upon
his
face
the
blasphemies
of
words
and
the
smartness
of
blows
which
that
gospel
mentions
in
which
compass
fell
that
gallicinium
that
crowing
of
the
cock
which
called
up
peter
to
his
repentance
how
thou
passedst
all
that
time
thou
knowest
if
thou
didst
any
thing
that
needest
peter
tears
and
hast
not
shed
them
let
me
be
thy
cock
do
it
now
now
thy
master
in
the
unworthiest
of
his
servants
looks
back
upon
thee
do
it
now
betimes
in
the
morning
so
soon
as
it
was
day
the
jews
held
a
council
in
the
high
priest
hall
and
agreed
upon
their
evidence
against
him
and
then
carried
him
to
pilate
who
was
to
be
his
judge
didst
thou
accuse
thyself
when
thou
wakedst
this
morning
and
wast
thou
content
even
with
false
accusations
that
is
rather
to
suspect
actions
to
have
been
sin
which
were
not
than
to
smother
and
justify
such
as
were
truly
sins
then
thou
spentest
that
hour
in
conformity
to
him
pilate
found
no
evidence
against
him
and
therefore
to
ease
himself
and
to
pass
a
compliment
upon
herod
tetrarch
of
galilee
who
was
at
that
time
at
jerusalem
because
christ
being
a
galilean
was
of
herod
jurisdiction
pilate
sent
him
to
herod
and
rather
as
a
madman
than
a
malefactor
herod
remanded
him
with
scorn
to
pilate
to
proceed
against
him
and
this
was
about
eight
of
the
clock
hast
thou
been
content
to
come
to
this
inquisition
this
examination
this
agitation
this
cribration
this
pursuit
of
thy
conscience
to
sift
it
to
follow
it
from
the
sins
of
thy
youth
to
thy
present
sins
from
the
sins
of
thy
bed
to
the
sins
of
thy
board
and
from
the
substance
to
the
circumstance
of
thy
sins
that
is
time
spent
like
thy
saviour
pilate
would
have
saved
christ
by
using
the
privilege
of
the
day
in
his
behalf
because
that
day
one
prisoner
was
to
be
delivered
but
they
choose
barabbas
he
would
have
saved
him
from
death
by
satisfying
their
fury
with
inflicting
other
torments
upon
him
scourging
and
crowning
with
thorns
and
loading
him
with
many
scornful
and
ignominious
contumelies
but
they
regarded
him
not
they
pressed
a
crucifying
hast
thou
gone
about
to
redeem
thy
sin
by
fasting
by
alms
by
disciplines
and
mortifications
in
way
of
satisfaction
to
the
justice
of
god
that
will
not
serve
that
is
not
the
right
way
we
press
an
utter
crucifying
of
that
sin
that
governs
thee
and
that
conforms
thee
to
christ
towards
noon
pilate
gave
judgment
and
they
made
such
haste
to
execution
as
that
by
noon
he
was
upon
the
cross
there
now
hangs
that
sacred
body
upon
the
cross
rebaptized
in
his
own
tears
and
sweat
and
embalmed
in
his
own
blood
alive
there
are
those
bowels
of
compassion
which
are
so
conspicuous
so
manifested
as
that
you
may
see
them
through
his
wounds
there
those
glorious
eyes
grew
faint
in
their
sight
so
as
the
sun
ashamed
to
survive
them
departed
with
his
light
too
and
then
that
son
of
god
who
was
never
from
us
and
yet
had
now
come
a
new
way
unto
us
in
assuming
our
nature
delivers
that
soul
which
was
never
out
of
his
father
hands
by
a
a
voluntary
emission
of
it
into
his
father
hands
for
though
this
god
our
lord
belonged
these
issues
of
so
that
considered
in
his
own
contract
he
must
necessarily
die
yet
at
no
breach
or
battery
which
they
had
made
upon
his
sacred
body
issued
his
soul
but
he
gave
up
the
ghost
and
as
god
breathed
a
soul
into
the
first
adam
so
this
second
adam
breathed
his
soul
into
god
into
the
hands
of
god
there
we
leave
you
in
that
blessed
dependency
to
hang
upon
him
that
hangs
upon
the
cross
there
bathe
in
his
tears
there
suck
at
his
wounds
and
lie
down
in
peace
in
his
grave
till
he
vouchsafe
you
a
resurrection
and
an
ascension
into
that
kingdom
which
he
hath
prepared
for
you
with
the
inestimable
price
of
his
incorruptible
blood
