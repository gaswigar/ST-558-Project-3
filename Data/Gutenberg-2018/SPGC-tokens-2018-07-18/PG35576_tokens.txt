preface
to
her
own
people
queen
victoria
was
england
itself
the
emblem
of
the
realm
and
of
the
empire
to
millions
who
were
not
her
people
the
words
the
queen
do
not
bring
even
yet
the
thought
of
the
woman
who
now
shares
the
english
throne
but
rather
of
her
who
for
nearly
years
wore
the
crown
of
great
britain
and
gave
freely
to
her
country
of
the
gift
that
was
in
her
other
women
have
been
controlled
by
devotion
to
duty
other
women
have
been
moved
to
action
by
readiness
of
sympathy
but
few
have
united
so
harmoniously
a
strong
determination
to
do
the
right
with
a
gentleness
a
childlike
sympathy
with
unyielding
strength
of
purpose
happy
is
the
realm
that
can
count
on
the
list
of
its
sovereigns
one
whose
career
was
so
strongly
marked
by
unfaltering
faithfulness
by
honesty
of
aim
and
by
statesmanlike
wisdom
of
action

i
baby
drina
elizabeth
would
be
a
good
name
for
her
said
the
duke
of
kent
elizabeth
was
the
greatest
woman
who
ever
sat
on
the
throne
of
england
the
english
people
are
used
to
the
name
and
they
like
it
but
would
the
emperor
alexander
be
pleased
asked
the
duchess
if
he
is
to
be
godfather
ought
she
not
to
be
named
for
him
alexandra
no
alexandrina
said
the
duke
thoughtfully
perhaps
you
are
right
alexandrina
has
a
good
sound
and
the
day
may
come
when
the
sovereign
of
england
will
be
as
glad
of
the
friendship
of
the
emperor
of
russia
as
the
regent
is
are
you
so
sure
edward
that
she
will
be
a
sovereign
asked
his
wife
with
a
smile
does
she
look
like
a
queen
demanded
the
duke
look
at
her
golden
hair
and
her
blue
eyes
there
see
how
she
put
her
hand
out
just
as
if
she
was
giving
a
command
i
do
believe
any
baby
a
week
old
ever
did
that
before
the
next
time
i
review
the
troops
she
shall
go
with
me
you
a
soldier
daughter
little
one
come
and
see
the
world
that
you
are
to
conquer
he
lifted
the
tiny
baby
much
to
the
displeasure
of
the
nurse
and
carried
her
across
the
room
to
the
window
that
looked
out
upon
kensington
garden
now
little
one
he
whispered
into
the
baby
ear
they
do
believe
us
and
we
wo
talk
about
it
but
you
be
queen
some
day
is
that
the
way
every
father
behaves
with
his
first
baby
asked
the
duchess
they
much
alike
your
grace
replied
the
nurse
rather
grimly
as
she
followed
the
duke
to
the
window
with
a
blanket
on
her
arm
the
duke
was
accustomed
to
commanding
thousands
of
men
and
every
one
of
them
trembled
if
his
weapons
and
uniform
were
not
spotless
or
if
he
had
been
guilty
of
the
least
neglect
of
duty
in
more
than
one
battle
the
duke
had
stood
so
firmly
that
he
had
received
the
thanks
of
parliament
for
his
bravery
and
fearlessness
he
would
never
have
surrendered
a
city
to
a
besieging
army
but
now
he
had
met
his
match
and
he
laid
the
baby
in
the
nurse
arms
with
the
utmost
meekness
the
question
of
a
name
for
the
child
was
not
yet
decided
for
the
wishes
of
someone
else
had
to
be
considered
and
that
was
the
prince
regent
the
duke
older
brother
george
he
thought
it
proper
that
his
niece
should
be
named
georgiana
in
honor
of
himself
georgiana
let
it
be
said
the
duke
of
kent
her
first
name
shall
be
alexandrina
then
georgiana
it
shall
be
declared
the
prince
regent
no
niece
of
mine
shall
put
my
name
second
to
any
king
or
emperor
here
in
my
own
country
call
her
alexandrina
alexandra
alexander
if
you
choose
but
she
not
be
called
alexandrina
georgiana
when
the
time
for
the
christening
had
arrived
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
and
the
bishop
of
london
came
to
kensington
in
company
with
the
crimson
velvet
curtains
from
the
chapel
at
james
and
a
beautiful
golden
font
which
had
been
taken
from
the
tower
for
the
baptism
of
the
royal
baby
the
archbishop
and
the
bishop
the
prince
regent
and
another
brother
of
the
duke
of
kent
who
was
to
represent
the
emperor
of
russia
as
godfather
all
stood
around
the
golden
font
in
the
magnificent
cupola
room
the
grand
saloon
of
kensington
palace
the
godmothers
were
the
child
grandmother
and
aunt
and
they
were
represented
by
english
princesses
all
the
royal
family
were
present
after
the
prayers
had
been
said
and
the
promises
of
the
sponsors
made
the
archbishop
took
the
little
princess
in
his
arms
and
turning
to
the
godfathers
and
the
godmothers
he
said
name
this
child
alexandrina
responded
the
duke
of
york
give
her
another
name
bade
the
duke
of
kent
in
a
low
tone
name
her
for
her
mother
then
said
the
prince
regent
to
the
archbishop
and
the
baby
was
christened
alexandrina
victoria
it
made
little
difference
to
either
the
duke
or
the
baby
how
the
prince
regent
might
feel
about
her
name
for
the
duke
was
the
happiest
of
fathers
and
the
little
drina
as
the
princess
was
called
was
a
merry
baby
everyone
at
kensington
loved
her
and
over
the
sea
was
a
grandmother
the
dowager
duchess
of
coburg
who
could
hardly
wait
for
the
day
to
come
when
she
would
be
able
to
see
the
child
how
pretty
the
little
mayflower
will
be
she
wrote
when
i
see
it
in
a
year
time
another
letter
said
the
english
like
queens
and
the
niece
of
the
beloved
princess
charlotte
will
be
most
dear
to
them
princess
charlotte
was
the
only
child
of
prince
george
and
the
nation
had
loved
her
and
longed
to
have
her
for
their
queen
she
had
married
leopold
the
brother
of
the
duchess
of
kent
and
had
died
only
two
years
before
princess
drina
was
born
the
succession
to
the
english
crown
was
in
a
peculiar
condition
the
king
george
had
become
insane
and
his
eldest
son
george
was
ruling
as
prince
regent
if
the
regent
lived
longer
than
his
father
he
would
become
george
iv
his
next
younger
brother
was
frederick
duke
of
york
then
came
william
duke
of
clarence
and
then
the
duke
of
kent
george
and
frederick
had
no
children
and
william
baby
girl
died
on
the
very
day
that
the
princess
alexandrina
was
born
if
these
three
brothers
died
without
children
the
duke
of
kent
would
become
king
but
even
then
if
the
duke
should
have
a
son
the
law
was
that
he
rather
than
the
daughter
should
inherit
the
crown
the
baby
princess
then
stood
fifth
in
the
succession
to
the
throne
and
a
child
born
to
any
one
of
these
three
uncles
or
a
son
born
to
her
father
would
remove
her
still
further
from
sovereignty
the
english
people
had
talked
of
all
these
possibilities
the
duke
of
kent
had
also
several
younger
brothers
but
they
were
all
men
the
youngest
and
not
one
of
them
had
a
child
if
all
the
children
of
george
iii
died
without
heirs
the
english
crown
would
descend
to
a
line
of
germans
who
had
never
walked
on
english
soil
we
have
had
one
king
who
could
not
speak
english
said
the
people
and
we
do
not
want
another
the
duke
of
kent
was
a
general
favorite
among
them
and
they
hoped
that
he
and
after
him
his
daughter
would
become
their
ruler
indeed
they
hoped
for
this
so
strongly
that
they
began
to
feel
sure
that
it
would
come
to
pass
everyone
wanted
to
see
the
little
princess
many
a
person
lingered
under
the
palace
windows
for
hours
and
went
away
feeling
well
repaid
for
the
delay
if
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
royal
baby
in
her
nurse
arms
when
the
princess
was
four
months
old
the
duke
gave
orders
one
afternoon
that
she
should
be
made
ready
for
a
drive
with
him
but
is
it
not
the
day
of
the
military
review
on
hounslow
heath
asked
the
duchess
yes
replied
the
duke
and
where
else
should
a
soldier
daughter
be
but
at
a
review
i
want
to
see
how
she
likes
the
army
you
know
she
will
be
at
the
head
of
the
army
some
day
he
added
half
in
jest
and
half
in
earnest
wo
you
let
me
have
her
the
duchess
shook
her
head
playfully
just
then
the
nurse
entered
the
room
with
the
little
princess
in
her
outdoor
wraps
the
tall
duke
caught
up
the
child
and
ran
to
the
carriage
like
a
naughty
boy
with
a
forbidden
plaything
and
the
nurse
followed
at
the
review
the
duke
was
not
so
stern
a
disciplinarian
as
usual
for
more
than
one
man
who
was
expected
to
stand
eyes
front
took
a
sly
look
at
the
pretty
baby
in
her
nurse
arms
and
the
proud
father
forgot
to
blame
him
for
the
misdemeanor
after
the
review
the
people
gathered
about
the
carriage
god
bless
the
child
cried
an
old
man
she
be
a
princess
charlotte
to
us
look
at
her
sweet
face
said
another
did
you
ever
see
such
bright
blue
eyes
she
be
a
queen
who
can
see
what
her
people
want
there
were
hurrahs
for
the
princess
and
hurrahs
for
the
duke
then
a
voice
in
the
crowd
cried
give
us
a
rousing
cheer
for
the
duchess
who
cares
for
her
own
baby
and
does
leave
her
to
the
hired
folk
in
all
this
hubbub
and
confusion
the
baby
did
not
cry
or
show
the
least
fear
she
a
soldier
child
said
the
duke
with
delight
and
he
took
her
from
the
nurse
and
helped
her
to
wave
her
tiny
hand
to
the
admiring
crowd
prince
george
had
never
been
on
good
terms
with
his
brother
the
duke
of
kent
and
after
the
affair
of
the
name
he
was
less
friendly
than
ever
he
was
always
jealous
of
the
child
and
when
he
heard
of
her
reception
at
the
review
he
was
thoroughly
angry
that
infant
is
too
young
to
be
brought
into
public
he
declared
she
was
not
brought
into
so
public
a
place
again
but
she
won
friends
wherever
she
went
the
duke
could
not
bear
to
have
her
away
from
him
for
an
hour
and
the
greatest
honor
he
could
show
to
a
guest
was
to
allow
him
to
take
the
little
one
in
his
arms
an
old
friend
was
at
the
palace
one
evening
and
when
he
rose
to
go
the
duke
said
no
come
with
me
first
and
see
the
child
in
her
crib
as
they
entered
the
room
of
the
little
princess
the
duke
said
we
are
going
to
sidmouth
in
two
or
three
days
to
cheat
the
winter
and
so
we
may
not
meet
again
for
some
time
i
want
you
to
give
my
child
your
blessing
pray
for
her
not
merely
that
her
life
may
be
brilliant
and
free
from
trouble
but
that
god
will
bless
her
and
that
in
all
the
years
to
come
he
will
guide
her
and
guard
her
the
prayer
was
made
and
the
duke
responded
with
an
earnest
amen
in
a
few
days
the
family
set
out
for
sidmouth
kensington
was
becoming
cold
and
damp
and
the
precious
baby
must
not
be
risked
in
the
london
chills
of
the
late
autumn
the
duchess
moreover
had
devoted
herself
so
closely
to
her
child
that
she
needed
a
change
and
rest
at
sidmouth
the
old
happy
life
of
the
past
six
months
went
on
for
a
little
while
the
house
was
so
small
that
it
was
called
hardly
more
than
a
cottage
but
it
had
pretty
verandas
and
bay
windows
shaded
by
climbing
roses
and
honeysuckles
it
stood
on
a
sunny
knoll
with
tall
trees
circling
around
it
just
below
the
knoll
was
a
little
brook
running
merrily
to
the
sea
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
and
following
the
lead
of
the
brook
was
the
road
sidmouth
was
a
nest
of
sunbeams
and
the
baby
princess
was
well
and
strong
she
is
too
healthy
i
fear
wrote
the
duke
in
the
opinion
of
some
members
of
my
family
by
whom
she
is
regarded
as
an
intruder
the
people
of
sidmouth
did
not
look
upon
the
pretty
baby
as
an
intruder
and
there
was
great
excitement
in
the
village
when
it
was
known
that
the
duke
had
taken
woolbrook
glen
every
boy
in
the
country
around
was
eager
to
see
the
soldier
duke
who
had
been
in
real
battles
and
every
girl
longed
for
a
sight
of
the
little
princess
there
was
no
difficulty
in
seeing
them
when
they
had
once
come
for
whenever
it
was
pleasant
they
were
out
of
doors
walking
or
driving
a
lady
who
met
the
party
one
morning
wrote
that
the
duke
and
the
duchess
were
strolling
along
arm
in
arm
and
close
to
them
was
the
nurse
carrying
the
princess
with
her
white
swansdown
bonnet
and
cloak
she
was
holding
out
her
hand
to
the
duke
and
just
as
the
village
people
drew
near
he
took
her
from
the
nurse
and
lifted
her
to
his
shoulder
when
the
duke
had
been
away
from
the
house
his
first
thought
on
returning
was
the
little
daughter
one
morning
only
a
few
days
after
this
meeting
with
the
lady
and
her
children
he
took
a
long
walk
in
the
rain
he
was
hardly
over
the
threshold
on
his
return
before
he
called
where
my
daughter
bring
little
drina
but
edward
the
duchess
objected
your
boots
must
be
wet
through
wo
you
change
them
first
you
will
surely
be
soldiers
are
ill
my
lady
replied
the
duke
laughing
i
never
was
ill
in
all
my
life
where
my
queen
an
hour
romp
with
the
merry
baby
followed
but
then
came
a
chill
and
the
strong
man
was
overcome
with
inflammation
of
the
lungs
in
those
days
physicians
had
little
knowledge
how
to
treat
such
a
disease
they
had
an
idea
that
whenever
one
was
feverish
he
had
too
much
blood
and
that
some
of
it
must
be
taken
away
so
the
duke
was
bled
until
if
he
had
not
been
in
the
least
ill
the
loss
of
blood
would
have
made
him
faint
and
weak
a
messenger
was
sent
to
london
to
bring
a
famous
doctor
but
when
he
came
the
duke
was
dead
i
could
have
done
nothing
else
said
the
great
man
except
to
bleed
him
much
more
than
you
have
done
prince
leopold
had
come
to
sidmouth
a
day
or
two
earlier
and
he
went
with
the
duchess
and
the
princess
to
london
the
villagers
gathered
about
the
carriage
to
bid
a
silent
farewell
to
the
sorrowful
company
many
of
them
were
weeping
and
their
tears
flowed
still
faster
when
the
nurse
held
the
baby
up
to
the
carriage
window
and
whispered
say
to
the
people
for
the
little
one
waved
her
hand
and
patted
the
glass
and
sprang
up
and
down
in
her
nurse
arms
without
the
least
realization
of
her
loss
the
carriage
rolled
away
but
the
people
stood
watching
it
until
it
was
out
of
sight
that
the
sweetest
child
in
all
england
said
one
woman
wiping
her
eyes
with
the
corner
of
her
apron
and
now
the
poor
little
thing
will
have
no
father
did
ever
you
see
a
man
so
fond
of
his
child
as
the
duke
said
another
with
a
sob
king
george
had
nine
sons
said
a
man
who
stood
near
and
the
duke
was
every
whit
the
best
of
them
the
king
never
treated
him
fairly
when
the
others
wanted
money
they
had
it
but
when
the
duke
needed
it
his
father
just
said
along
as
you
can
there
was
one
of
the
sons
that
the
king
was
kinder
to
than
to
the
duke
he
have
little
more
chance
to
be
kind
or
unkind
declared
another
have
you
not
heard
the
news
from
london
the
king
is
very
ill
and
the
prince
regent
will
soon
be
george
iv
it
bad
luck
speaking
ill
of
him
that
to
be
king
said
one
but
the
man
that
gone
to
london
in
his
coffin
was
the
man
that
i
have
liked
to
see
on
the
throne
will
the
duchess
go
back
to
her
own
land
think
you
questioned
the
first
woman
yes
that
she
will
replied
the
second
positively
there
never
was
a
woman
that
loved
her
own
people
better
than
she
folks
say
she
writes
her
mother
every
day
of
her
life
i
say
she
not
go
back
declared
one
of
the
men
with
equal
positiveness
she
do
her
duty
and
her
duty
is
to
care
for
the
princess
god
bless
her
and
make
her
our
queen
some
day
so
the
people
in
the
village
talked
and
so
people
were
talking
throughout
the
kingdom
after
the
first
sad
days
were
past
the
question
had
to
be
decided
by
the
duchess
and
her
devoted
brother
leopold
the
duchess
loved
her
family
and
her
old
home
at
amorbach
near
heidelberg
there
she
and
the
duke
had
spent
the
first
months
of
their
married
life
and
nothing
would
have
helped
her
more
to
bear
her
loneliness
than
a
return
to
the
bavarian
palace
in
which
every
room
was
associated
with
memories
of
him
she
was
a
stranger
in
england
and
she
could
not
even
speak
the
language
of
the
country
the
duke
sisters
loved
her
and
adelaide
who
had
been
a
german
princess
before
she
became
the
wife
of
the
duke
of
clarence
gave
her
the
warmest
sympathy
in
this
time
of
sorrow
but
the
regent
disliked
her
and
had
always
seemed
indignant
at
the
possibility
that
his
brother
child
would
inherit
the
throne
the
regent
had
now
become
king
for
his
father
had
died
on
the
very
day
of
the
duchess
return
to
london
unless
a
child
was
born
to
either
the
duke
of
york
or
the
duke
of
clarence
the
baby
princess
would
become
queen
at
their
death
the
child
who
would
rule
england
ought
to
be
brought
up
in
england
there
was
something
else
to
be
considered
however
when
the
duchess
was
only
a
girl
of
seventeen
she
had
become
the
wife
of
the
prince
of
leiningen
and
at
his
death
he
had
made
her
sole
guardian
of
their
two
children
charles
and
féodore
as
soon
as
charles
was
old
enough
he
would
succeed
his
father
as
ruler
of
leiningen
but
until
then
his
mother
was
regent
is
it
right
for
me
to
neglect
my
duties
in
bavaria
questioned
the
duchess
to
give
up
the
regency
of
leiningen
shall
i
neglect
charles
to
care
for
drina
interest
charles
will
be
well
cared
for
said
prince
leopold
his
people
love
him
already
and
will
be
true
to
him
england
is
a
great
kingdom
it
is
not
an
easy
land
to
rule
a
queen
who
has
grown
up
in
another
country
will
never
hold
the
hearts
of
the
people
true
said
the
duchess
i
must
live
in
england
that
is
my
duty
to
my
child
and
to
her
country
how
the
duchess
and
her
child
were
to
live
was
a
question
of
much
importance
the
king
could
not
refuse
to
allow
them
to
occupy
their
old
apartments
in
kensington
palace
but
the
duchess
was
almost
penniless
nearly
all
the
money
which
her
first
husband
had
left
her
she
had
been
obliged
to
give
up
on
her
second
marriage
and
she
had
surrendered
all
the
duke
property
to
his
creditors
to
go
as
far
as
it
would
in
paying
his
debts
some
money
had
been
settled
upon
her
when
she
married
the
duke
but
that
was
so
tied
up
that
it
would
be
many
months
before
she
could
touch
it
the
only
plea
that
she
could
make
to
the
king
would
be
on
the
ground
that
her
child
might
become
his
heir
and
nothing
would
have
enraged
him
so
much
as
to
suggest
such
a
thing
whatever
parliament
might
appropriate
to
the
princess
would
be
given
against
the
wishes
of
the
king
and
there
would
at
any
rate
be
a
long
delay
it
was
a
strange
condition
of
affairs
the
child
would
probably
have
millions
at
her
command
before
many
years
had
passed
but
for
the
present
there
was
no
money
even
to
pay
the
wages
of
the
servants
for
their
care
of
her
illustration
her
royal
highness
the
duchess
of
kent
and
princess
victoria
painting
by
sir
beechey
if
this
story
had
been
a
fairy
tale
the
fairy
godmother
with
the
magic
wand
would
have
been
called
upon
to
shower
golden
guineas
into
the
empty
purse
but
in
this
case
it
was
the
good
uncle
who
came
to
the
aid
of
his
princess
niece
when
prince
leopold
married
the
princess
charlotte
he
went
to
england
to
live
for
he
expected
that
some
day
his
wife
would
become
queen
of
great
britain
after
her
death
he
made
his
home
in
england
but
spent
much
of
his
time
in
travelling
he
was
not
rich
but
he
was
glad
to
help
his
sister
as
much
as
possible
and
after
the
death
of
the
duke
of
kent
he
made
her
and
her
children
his
first
care
it
was
decided
then
that
the
duchess
would
remain
in
england
and
that
kensington
palace
should
become
the
home
of
the
princess
alexandrina
victoria
this
was
a
large
abode
it
had
been
a
favorite
home
of
several
of
the
english
sovereigns
about
it
were
gardens
cut
into
beds
shaped
like
scrolls
palm
leaves
ovals
circles
and
all
sorts
of
conventional
figures
so
prim
and
stiff
that
one
might
well
have
wondered
how
flowers
ever
dared
to
grow
in
any
shape
but
rectangular
the
yew
trees
were
trimmed
into
peacocks
and
lions
and
other
kinds
of
birds
and
beasts
all
this
was
interesting
only
as
a
curiosity
but
there
was
a
pretty
pond
and
there
were
long
beautiful
avenues
of
trees
there
were
flowers
and
shrubs
and
soft
green
turf
it
was
out
of
the
fog
and
smoke
of
the
city
indeed
it
was
so
far
out
that
there
was
danger
of
robbers
to
the
man
who
ventured
to
walk
or
drive
at
night
through
the
unlighted
roads
for
many
years
after
the
birth
of
the
princess
a
bell
was
rung
sunday
evenings
so
that
all
londoners
might
meet
and
guard
against
danger
by
going
over
the
lonely
way
to
their
homes
in
one
large
company
the
life
at
kensington
was
very
quiet
no
one
would
have
guessed
from
seeing
the
royal
baby
that
the
fate
which
lay
before
her
was
different
from
that
to
be
expected
for
any
other
child
who
was
not
the
daughter
of
a
prince
she
spent
much
of
the
time
out
of
doors
at
first
in
the
arms
of
her
nurse
then
in
a
tiny
carriage
in
which
her
the
princess
féodore
liked
to
draw
her
about
she
must
learn
never
to
be
afraid
of
people
declared
the
wise
mother
and
before
the
child
could
speak
plainly
she
was
taught
to
make
a
little
bow
when
strangers
came
near
her
carriage
and
say
morning
lady
or
morning
sir
the
little
girl
was
happy
but
life
was
hard
for
the
mother
she
had
given
up
her
home
and
her
friends
and
now
she
had
to
give
up
even
her
own
language
for
english
and
not
german
must
be
her
child
mother
tongue
and
she
set
to
work
bravely
to
conquer
the
mysteries
of
english
her
greatest
comfort
in
her
loneliness
was
the
company
of
the
duchess
adelaide
wife
of
the
duke
of
clarence
for
many
weeks
after
the
death
of
the
duke
of
kent
the
duchess
drove
to
kensington
every
day
to
spend
some
time
with
her
when
the
princess
was
about
a
year
and
a
half
old
a
little
daughter
was
born
to
the
duchess
adelaide
but
in
three
months
she
was
again
childless
she
had
none
of
the
royal
brothers
jealousy
of
the
baby
at
kensington
and
she
wrote
to
the
duchess
of
kent
my
little
girls
are
dead
but
your
child
lives
and
she
shall
be
mine
too
chapter
ii
the
schooldays
of
a
princess
nothing
could
be
more
simple
than
the
order
of
the
princess
day
at
kensington
breakfast
was
at
eight
and
it
was
eaten
out
of
doors
whenever
the
weather
was
good
the
princess
sat
in
a
tiny
rosewood
chair
beside
her
mother
and
the
little
girl
breakfast
was
spread
on
a
low
table
before
her
whatever
other
children
might
have
there
were
no
luxuries
for
this
child
bread
and
milk
and
fruit
made
up
her
breakfast
and
nothing
more
would
have
been
given
her
no
matter
how
she
might
have
begged
for
it
after
breakfast
she
would
have
liked
to
play
with
her
beloved
féodore
but
féodore
had
to
go
to
her
lessons
when
the
weather
was
fair
however
a
pleasure
awaited
the
little
girl
her
uncle
the
duke
of
york
had
given
her
a
white
donkey
and
at
this
hour
she
was
allowed
to
ride
it
in
kensington
gardens
her
nurse
walked
beside
her
and
on
the
other
side
was
an
old
soldier
whom
her
father
had
especially
liked
this
riding
was
a
great
delight
to
the
child
but
there
was
sometimes
a
storm
of
childish
wrath
before
the
hour
was
over
for
the
duchess
had
said
she
must
ride
and
walk
by
turns
and
when
the
turn
came
for
walking
the
tiny
maiden
often
objected
to
obeying
her
mother
orders
when
it
was
time
for
the
duchess
to
eat
luncheon
the
princess
had
her
dinner
but
it
was
so
simple
a
meal
that
many
of
the
servants
of
the
palace
would
have
felt
themselves
very
hardly
used
if
they
had
had
no
greater
variety
and
no
richer
fare
the
afternoon
was
often
spent
under
the
trees
and
at
some
time
either
before
supper
or
after
came
a
drive
with
her
mother
supper
was
at
seven
but
the
little
girl
meal
consisted
of
nothing
but
bread
and
milk
at
nine
she
was
put
to
bed
not
in
the
nursery
but
in
her
mother
room
for
the
duchess
had
no
idea
of
being
separated
from
her
children
and
the
princess
féodore
slept
at
one
side
of
her
mother
while
on
the
other
hand
stood
the
little
bed
of
the
baby
sister
it
was
a
simple
happy
healthy
life
the
great
objection
to
it
was
that
the
child
rarely
had
a
playmate
of
her
own
age
two
little
girls
daughters
of
an
old
friend
of
the
duke
came
once
a
week
to
see
her
but
they
were
several
years
her
seniors
féodore
was
never
weary
of
playing
with
her
but
féodore
was
almost
twelve
years
older
so
that
when
the
child
was
four
years
old
féodore
was
quite
a
young
lady
perhaps
no
one
realized
how
much
she
needed
children
of
her
own
age
for
she
was
so
merry
and
cheerful
so
ready
to
be
pleased
and
amused
and
so
friendly
with
everyone
who
came
near
her
a
learned
clergyman
reported
that
when
he
called
on
the
duchess
the
little
princess
was
on
the
floor
beside
her
mother
with
her
playthings
of
which
i
soon
became
one
he
added
one
day
the
duchess
said
drina
there
is
a
little
girl
only
a
year
older
than
you
who
plays
wonderfully
well
on
the
harp
should
you
like
to
hear
her
i
almost
four
years
old
was
the
child
reply
what
is
her
name
she
is
called
lyra
said
the
duchess
should
you
like
to
hear
her
play
the
princess
was
very
fond
of
music
even
when
she
was
hardly
more
than
a
baby
and
she
could
scarcely
wait
for
the
day
to
come
when
she
could
hear
the
little
girl
at
last
lyra
and
her
harp
were
brought
to
the
palace
and
the
music
began
the
talented
child
played
piece
after
piece
then
she
stopped
a
moment
to
rest
this
was
the
opportunity
music
was
good
but
a
real
little
girl
was
a
great
rarity
and
the
small
hostess
began
a
conversation
does
your
doll
have
a
red
dress
she
asked
mine
has
and
she
has
a
bonnet
with
on
it
does
yours
have
a
bonnet
i
have
any
doll
answered
lyra
have
you
any
playroom
asked
the
princess
wonderingly
no
said
the
little
musician
the
princess
had
supposed
that
all
children
had
dolls
and
toys
and
she
said
i
have
a
playroom
upstairs
and
there
are
dolls
in
it
and
a
house
for
them
and
a
big
big
ship
like
the
one
my
papa
sailed
in
once
have
you
any
ship
or
any
no
have
you
any
sister
féodore
no
then
the
little
princess
threw
her
arm
around
the
child
musician
and
said
come
over
here
to
the
rug
and
let
play
you
shall
have
some
of
my
playthings
and
perhaps
your
mamma
will
make
you
a
when
you
go
home
the
duchess
had
left
the
two
children
for
a
few
minutes
and
when
she
returned
they
were
sitting
on
the
fur
rug
in
front
of
the
fire
the
harp
was
forgotten
and
they
were
having
a
delightful
time
playing
dolls
just
as
if
they
were
not
the
one
a
princess
and
the
other
a
musical
prodigy
they
were
too
busy
to
notice
the
duchess
and
as
she
stood
at
the
door
a
moment
she
heard
her
little
daughter
saying
you
may
have
the
doll
to
take
home
with
you
lyra
put
on
her
red
dress
and
her
white
bonnet
and
her
cloak
for
she
be
ill
if
you
do
her
name
is
adelaide
for
that
is
my
aunt
name
the
princess
was
not
yet
four
years
old
but
her
mother
was
beginning
to
feel
somewhat
anxious
about
her
education
other
children
might
play
but
the
child
who
was
to
be
queen
of
england
must
not
be
allowed
to
give
even
her
babyhood
to
amusement
the
mother
began
to
teach
her
the
alphabet
but
the
little
girl
had
a
very
decided
will
of
her
own
and
she
did
not
wish
to
learn
the
alphabet
but
you
will
never
be
able
to
read
books
as
i
do
if
you
do
not
learn
said
the
mother
then
i
learn
promised
the
child
i
learn
very
quick
the
alphabet
was
learned
but
the
resolutions
of
old
children
do
not
always
endure
and
the
small
student
objected
to
further
study
my
little
girl
does
not
like
her
books
as
well
as
i
could
wish
wrote
the
duchess
to
her
mother
but
the
grandmother
took
the
part
of
the
child
do
not
tease
your
little
puss
with
learning
was
her
reply
she
is
so
young
still
albert
is
only
making
eyes
at
a
picture
book
this
albert
was
one
of
the
princess
german
cousins
only
a
few
weeks
younger
than
she
and
the
great
delight
of
the
coburg
grandmother
was
to
compare
the
growth
and
attainments
of
the
two
children
and
note
all
their
amusing
little
speeches
the
duchess
however
did
not
follow
the
advice
of
her
mother
but
more
than
a
month
before
her
little
daughter
was
four
years
old
she
decided
to
engage
a
tutor
for
her
she
herself
and
féodore
were
reading
english
with
the
rev
davys
the
clergyman
of
a
neighboring
parish
and
during
even
the
first
few
lessons
the
duchess
was
so
charmed
with
his
gentle
kindly
manner
and
his
intellectual
ability
that
she
said
to
him
one
day
you
teach
so
well
that
i
wish
you
would
teach
my
little
daughter
so
it
was
that
the
learned
clergyman
appeared
at
the
palace
one
bright
april
morning
armed
with
a
box
of
alphabet
blocks
the
duchess
seemed
quite
troubled
and
anxious
about
the
small
child
intellectual
deficiencies
and
when
the
preparations
for
the
lesson
had
been
made
she
said
now
victoria
if
you
are
good
and
say
your
lesson
well
i
will
give
you
the
box
of
straw
that
you
wanted
i
be
good
mamma
the
little
girl
promised
but
wo
you
please
give
me
the
box
first
the
lesson
began
with
a
review
of
the
alphabet
then
came
a
struggle
with
the
mysterious
which
we
did
not
quite
conquer
the
tutor
regretfully
writes
davys
kept
a
journal
of
the
progress
of
the
princess
during
the
first
two
years
of
his
instruction
and
he
records
gravely
after
the
second
lesson
that
she
pronounced
as
that
he
did
not
succeed
in
teaching
her
to
count
as
far
as
five
and
that
when
he
tried
to
show
her
how
to
make
an
he
could
not
make
her
move
her
hand
in
the
right
direction
it
seems
to
have
been
a
somewhat
willful
little
hand
for
a
week
later
when
he
wished
her
to
make
an
she
would
make
nothing
but
if
you
will
make
said
the
patient
tutor
you
shall
have
a
copy
of
but
when
had
come
and
the
copy
had
been
prepared
the
capricious
little
maiden
did
not
care
to
make
she
preferred
to
make
the
troubled
instructor
tried
various
plans
to
interest
his
small
charge
he
wrote
short
words
on
cards
and
asked
her
to
bring
them
to
him
from
another
part
of
the
room
as
he
named
them
he
read
her
stories
and
nursery
rhymes
and
one
day
when
he
seems
to
have
been
almost
at
his
wit
end
he
persuaded
the
princess
féodore
and
her
governess
to
stand
with
his
little
pupil
and
recite
as
if
they
were
in
a
class
at
school
his
report
for
that
day
records
with
a
good
deal
of
satisfaction
this
seemed
to
please
her
willful
as
she
was
however
she
was
very
and
when
he
asked
her
to
spell
the
word
she
sobbed
and
cried
because
she
fancied
that
he
was
applying
it
to
herself
when
davys
came
in
the
morning
he
would
frequently
inquire
if
she
had
been
good
one
day
he
asked
the
duchess
was
the
princess
good
while
she
was
in
the
nursery
she
was
good
this
morning
replied
her
mother
but
yesterday
there
was
quite
a
little
storm
yes
mamma
added
the
honest
little
girl
there
were
two
storms
one
when
i
was
washed
and
another
when
i
was
dressed
sometimes
her
honesty
put
her
mother
into
a
difficult
position
one
day
the
duchess
said
victoria
when
you
are
naughty
you
make
both
me
and
yourself
very
unhappy
no
mamma
the
child
replied
not
me
but
you
the
lessons
went
on
with
much
regularity
considering
that
the
pupil
was
a
princess
on
her
fourth
birthday
she
not
only
had
a
birthday
party
but
she
was
invited
to
court
uncle
king
as
she
called
george
gave
a
state
dinner
and
she
was
asked
to
be
one
of
the
guests
most
children
however
would
have
thought
the
invitation
hardly
worth
accepting
for
she
was
only
brought
into
the
room
for
a
few
minutes
to
speak
to
the
king
and
the
royal
family
then
she
was
taken
away
to
eat
her
usual
simple
meal
when
the
princess
had
been
studying
with
davys
about
five
months
she
was
taken
to
the
seashore
and
from
there
she
wrote
or
rather
printed
a
letter
to
her
tutor
it
said
my
dear
sir
i
do
not
forget
my
letters
nor
will
i
forget
you
victoria
the
name
alexandrina
had
been
gradually
dropped
the
duchess
had
feared
at
first
that
as
victoria
was
unfamiliar
in
england
the
english
people
might
dislike
it
moreover
as
the
royal
brothers
were
so
unfriendly
to
her
she
did
not
wish
that
the
use
of
her
name
should
prejudice
them
against
the
child
there
was
little
danger
of
anyone
disliking
the
child
however
for
she
was
so
winsome
a
young
maiden
that
whoever
spoke
to
her
became
her
friend
one
of
her
most
devoted
admirers
was
her
uncle
leopold
and
her
idea
of
the
highest
bliss
was
to
make
a
visit
at
his
house
a
few
months
after
the
beginning
of
her
education
she
visited
him
and
davys
drove
to
the
house
twice
a
week
to
continue
her
instruction
her
uncle
was
present
at
the
lessons
and
he
was
as
troubled
as
the
duchess
because
little
victoria
did
not
like
to
read
it
is
no
wonder
that
the
child
enjoyed
her
visits
to
claremont
prince
leopold
home
was
a
large
brick
mansion
with
stately
cedars
on
the
lawn
and
high
up
on
a
column
a
great
bronze
peacock
that
was
a
source
of
wonder
and
amusement
there
was
a
lake
with
groves
of
pines
beyond
it
there
was
a
farm
with
lambs
and
calves
and
ducklings
best
of
all
there
was
uncle
leopold
who
was
always
ready
to
walk
or
drive
with
her
and
to
tell
her
wonderful
stories
it
was
very
delightful
to
visit
an
uncle
who
was
a
prince
but
even
at
claremont
it
was
never
forgotten
that
the
wee
child
was
being
trained
to
be
a
queen
the
stories
must
not
be
without
a
moral
her
charming
talks
of
flowers
and
animals
must
be
planned
to
introduce
her
to
botany
and
natural
history
and
even
in
her
play
she
was
carefully
watched
lest
some
thoughtlessness
should
be
overlooked
which
ought
to
be
checked
one
day
she
took
her
tiny
rake
and
began
to
make
a
haycock
but
before
it
was
done
something
else
interested
her
and
she
dropped
the
rake
no
no
princess
called
her
governess
come
back
and
finish
the
haycock
you
must
never
leave
a
thing
half
done
in
kensington
she
was
never
taken
to
church
lest
she
should
attract
too
much
attention
but
service
was
read
in
the
chapel
of
the
palace
at
claremont
however
she
went
to
the
village
church
she
usually
wore
a
white
dress
made
as
simply
as
that
of
any
village
child
and
a
plain
little
straw
bonnet
but
at
the
church
door
the
resemblance
ended
for
while
other
children
might
fidget
about
or
perhaps
go
to
sleep
the
princess
had
some
hard
work
to
do
davys
had
said
that
she
was
volatile
and
disliked
fixing
her
attention
that
fault
must
be
corrected
of
course
and
so
the
child
was
required
to
remember
and
repeat
to
her
mother
not
only
the
text
but
the
principal
heads
of
the
sermon
no
matter
how
uninteresting
it
might
be
the
little
girl
must
have
longed
to
do
something
somewhere
with
no
one
to
watch
her
there
is
a
story
that
when
she
once
went
to
visit
the
duchess
of
clarence
her
aunt
asked
now
victoria
what
should
you
like
to
do
what
will
be
the
greatest
treat
i
can
give
you
and
the
little
child
replied
oh
aunt
adelaide
if
you
will
only
let
me
clean
the
windows
rather
do
that
than
anything
else
money
matters
had
become
somewhat
easier
for
the
duchess
as
an
allowance
had
been
made
her
which
enabled
her
to
give
the
princess
such
surroundings
and
advantages
as
ought
to
be
given
to
one
in
her
position
nevertheless
the
simplicity
of
the
child
daily
life
was
not
altered
and
her
pocket
money
was
not
made
any
more
lavish
when
the
little
girl
was
seven
years
old
she
was
taken
to
a
bazaar
where
she
bought
presents
for
one
after
another
until
she
had
reached
the
bottom
of
her
rather
shallow
purse
but
there
was
a
box
that
she
did
so
want
to
give
to
someone
i
should
like
this
very
much
she
said
wistfully
but
i
have
no
more
money
that
makes
no
difference
replied
the
storekeeper
and
he
began
to
wrap
the
box
with
her
other
purchases
no
objected
the
governess
the
princess
has
not
the
money
and
she
must
not
buy
what
she
can
not
pay
for
then
i
will
lay
it
aside
until
she
can
purchase
it
said
the
storekeeper
and
the
little
girl
exclaimed
oh
thank
you
if
you
will
be
so
good
when
the
day
for
the
payment
of
her
allowance
came
the
child
did
not
delay
a
moment
but
long
before
her
breakfast
hour
she
appeared
at
the
store
to
pay
for
the
box
and
carry
it
home
with
her
she
was
not
at
all
afraid
of
carrying
bundles
and
thought
it
was
a
delightful
expedition
to
go
to
the
milliner
with
her
mother
and
féodore
to
buy
a
new
hat
to
wait
in
the
shop
until
it
was
trimmed
and
then
carry
it
home
in
her
own
hand
the
great
excitement
of
her
seventh
year
was
the
visit
that
she
paid
the
king
disagreeable
as
he
often
was
to
the
mother
he
made
himself
quite
charming
to
the
child
and
he
was
delighted
with
the
frank
affection
that
she
showed
him
in
return
the
band
shall
play
whatever
you
choose
he
said
to
her
what
shall
it
be
i
should
like
save
the
king
replied
the
little
girl
it
was
hard
to
be
jealous
of
such
an
heir
to
the
throne
as
that
during
her
stay
the
king
had
taken
her
to
drive
and
this
was
a
great
event
for
he
himself
had
held
the
reins
when
she
was
saying
farewell
at
the
close
of
the
visit
he
asked
what
have
you
enjoyed
most
during
your
visit
and
he
was
much
pleased
when
she
answered
oh
uncle
king
the
drive
i
had
with
you
it
is
no
wonder
that
the
grandmother
in
coburg
wrote
the
little
monkey
must
have
pleased
and
amused
him
she
is
such
a
pretty
clever
child
the
duchess
was
beginning
to
receive
the
reward
that
she
deserved
for
giving
up
her
home
and
her
friends
not
only
in
the
result
of
her
devotion
to
her
little
daughter
as
shown
in
the
child
character
but
also
in
the
appreciation
of
herself
and
her
efforts
which
was
felt
in
her
adopted
country
in
both
the
house
of
lords
and
the
house
of
commons
speeches
had
been
made
paying
the
warmest
tributes
to
the
manner
in
which
she
was
bringing
up
the
little
girl
who
was
to
become
the
queen
before
victoria
was
eight
years
old
it
was
thought
to
be
time
for
her
education
to
receive
still
more
attention
though
one
would
suppose
that
there
need
have
been
no
anxiety
about
the
intellectual
progress
of
the
child
who
before
she
was
six
years
old
could
repeat
the
heads
of
one
of
the
lengthy
sermons
of
the
day
davys
was
now
formally
appointed
her
tutor
and
he
went
to
live
at
kensington
then
indeed
there
was
work
miss
lehzen
governess
of
the
princess
féodore
taught
the
child
as
usual
a
made
his
appearance
who
taught
her
the
clear
refined
and
dignified
hand
that
never
changed
a
teacher
of
singing
was
engaged
another
teacher
instructed
her
in
dancing
a
royal
academician
taught
her
drawing
german
and
french
were
also
studied
davys
special
work
was
to
teach
her
history
and
english
and
the
number
of
books
that
she
read
with
him
is
somewhat
startling
during
the
year
there
were
four
books
of
scriptural
stories
and
four
books
of
moral
stories
on
her
list
the
children
books
of
the
day
had
a
fashion
of
not
being
satisfied
with
teaching
one
thing
at
a
time
and
even
one
of
the
four
natural
histories
that
she
read
contrived
to
make
the
story
of
each
bird
contain
some
profound
moral
instruction
one
book
on
english
history
and
one
on
modern
history
in
general
appear
on
the
list
geography
and
grammar
are
each
represented
by
two
small
volumes
poetry
appears
in
the
form
of
the
infant
minstrel
a
title
which
the
old
child
of
would
utterly
scorn
general
knowledge
is
represented
by
one
book
on
the
famous
picture
galleries
castles
and
other
noteworthy
structures
in
england
and
another
describing
the
occupations
and
trades
of
the
land
even
here
however
moral
lessons
had
their
allotted
place
and
each
trade
was
made
to
teach
some
moral
truth
the
third
book
of
the
series
described
the
quaint
old
customs
of
the
kingdom
during
the
following
three
years
the
instruction
of
the
princess
was
continued
on
similar
lines
in
the
year
in
which
her
eighth
birthday
occurred
she
began
a
book
with
the
comprehensive
title
an
introduction
to
astronomy
geography
and
the
use
of
the
globes
after
she
had
studied
this
book
with
the
hard
name
for
two
years
it
seems
a
great
intellectual
downfall
to
find
her
promoted
to
elements
of
geography
for
the
use
of
young
children
in
she
began
latin
she
also
studied
the
catechism
and
then
an
abridgment
of
the
two
testaments
remembering
that
the
little
girl
was
studying
french
german
music
dancing
and
drawing
one
wonders
how
she
ever
crowded
it
in
fortunately
her
schedule
for
the
week
has
been
preserved
and
it
is
interesting
reading
her
day
work
began
at
nine
on
monday
morning
the
first
hour
was
given
to
geography
and
natural
history
the
second
to
a
drawing
lesson
from
eleven
till
three
was
devoted
to
dinner
and
either
playing
or
walking
from
three
to
four
she
drew
or
wrote
a
latin
exercise
the
following
hour
was
given
to
french
and
from
five
to
six
came
music
and
repetition
whatever
that
may
have
been
for
davys
after
her
three
hours
of
study
in
the
afternoon
without
even
a
recess
the
day
work
was
at
an
end
and
from
six
to
nine
there
was
no
more
studying
but
there
seems
to
have
been
some
instructive
reading
aloud
by
either
the
duchess
or
miss
lehzen
for
the
story
has
survived
that
when
the
duchess
was
reading
roman
history
and
read
the
old
story
of
cornelia
pointing
to
her
sons
and
declaring
these
are
my
jewels
the
small
critic
remarked
but
mamma
she
ought
to
have
said
are
my
carnelians
no
two
days
in
the
princess
week
were
alike
one
hour
a
week
was
devoted
to
learning
the
catechism
another
to
a
dancing
lesson
another
to
needlework
and
learning
poetry
by
heart
all
this
teaching
went
on
for
six
days
in
the
week
for
she
had
no
saturday
holidays
and
on
saturday
morning
came
an
hour
that
would
alarm
most
children
for
it
was
devoted
to
a
repetition
to
davys
of
all
that
she
had
learned
during
the
week
her
lessons
were
made
as
interesting
as
possible
by
explanations
and
stories
and
pictures
and
games
a
history
and
a
little
german
grammar
were
written
expressly
for
her
but
after
all
the
little
girl
was
the
one
who
had
to
do
the
work
she
had
to
understand
and
learn
and
remember
and
even
if
she
was
a
princess
no
one
could
do
these
things
for
her
sir
walter
scott
dined
with
the
duchess
of
kent
during
victoria
ninth
year
he
wrote
in
his
journal
was
presented
to
the
little
princess
victoria
the
to
the
throne
as
things
now
stand
it
is
no
wonder
that
he
added
this
lady
is
educated
with
much
care
the
same
year
stole
away
the
beloved
féodore
for
she
married
a
german
prince
and
went
to
the
continent
to
live
this
was
a
great
loss
to
the
little
princess
for
she
was
so
carefully
guarded
that
féodore
had
been
almost
her
only
playmate
other
children
had
companions
without
number
they
went
to
children
parties
and
had
good
times
generally
but
a
party
was
a
great
rarity
in
the
life
of
the
princess
and
she
was
ten
years
old
before
she
went
to
a
children
ball
this
famous
ball
which
she
then
attended
was
her
first
sight
of
a
court
ceremonial
it
was
given
in
honor
of
a
little
girl
of
her
own
age
maria
queen
of
portugal
who
was
making
a
visit
to
england
the
princess
wore
a
simple
white
dress
but
the
little
donna
maria
was
gorgeous
in
crimson
velvet
all
ablaze
with
jewels
every
one
was
comparing
the
two
children
in
dress
and
looks
and
manners
the
plain
dress
of
the
princess
was
generally
preferred
and
her
graceful
manners
were
admired
but
the
portuguese
queen
was
called
the
prettier
when
the
king
first
talked
of
giving
this
ball
a
lady
of
the
court
exclaimed
oh
do
it
will
be
so
nice
to
see
the
little
dancing
together
the
king
was
very
angry
at
the
speech
but
he
finally
decided
to
give
the
ball
and
the
two
little
queens
did
dance
in
the
same
quadrille
it
is
rather
sad
to
relate
that
the
small
lady
from
portugal
fell
down
and
hurt
herself
and
in
spite
of
the
sympathy
of
the
king
she
went
away
crying
while
the
english
princess
danced
on
and
had
the
most
delightful
evening
of
her
life
then
cinderella
went
to
bed
and
in
the
morning
she
awoke
to
the
workaday
world
that
she
had
left
for
a
single
evening
chapter
iii
examination
day
when
queen
victoria
was
a
tiny
child
she
is
said
to
have
asked
her
mother
one
day
mamma
why
is
it
that
when
féodore
and
i
are
walking
all
the
gentlemen
raise
their
hats
to
me
and
not
to
her
in
when
she
was
nearly
eleven
years
old
her
mother
and
her
teachers
thought
that
it
was
time
for
her
question
to
be
answered
the
king
was
so
ill
that
everyone
knew
he
could
not
live
many
months
the
duke
of
york
had
died
three
years
earlier
therefore
at
the
king
death
william
duke
of
clarence
would
ascend
the
throne
and
victoria
would
succeed
him
it
seems
quite
probable
that
the
bright
little
girl
had
before
this
time
answered
the
question
for
herself
there
are
stories
that
if
she
failed
in
a
lesson
a
certain
teasing
boy
cousin
of
hers
used
to
say
yes
a
pretty
queen
you
will
make
and
then
he
would
suggest
that
when
a
queen
did
not
rule
well
her
head
was
likely
to
be
cut
off
another
story
is
that
when
the
child
was
reading
aloud
to
her
mother
about
the
princess
charlotte
she
suddenly
looked
up
from
her
book
and
asked
mamma
shall
i
ever
be
a
queen
tradition
says
that
the
duchess
replied
it
is
very
possible
i
want
you
to
be
a
good
woman
and
then
you
will
be
a
good
queen
whether
there
is
any
truth
in
these
stories
or
not
the
child
was
too
observing
not
to
have
noticed
when
very
young
that
she
was
treated
differently
from
other
children
even
her
sister
féodore
she
lived
very
simply
and
miss
lehzen
was
always
at
hand
to
correct
the
least
approach
to
a
fault
but
she
could
not
have
failed
to
see
that
she
was
watched
wherever
she
went
and
that
far
more
attention
was
paid
to
her
than
to
her
mother
indeed
she
herself
said
long
afterwards
that
the
knowledge
of
her
position
came
to
her
gradually
and
that
she
cried
much
at
the
thought
of
ever
having
to
be
a
queen
the
little
girl
kept
these
thoughts
to
herself
and
even
her
mother
did
not
know
that
she
was
dreading
a
future
on
a
throne
there
are
several
accounts
of
just
how
she
was
finally
told
that
she
would
some
day
wear
the
crown
but
a
version
which
may
be
trusted
comes
from
davys
princess
he
said
i
wish
you
to
give
me
a
chart
of
the
kings
and
queens
of
england
when
morning
came
she
gave
him
the
chart
and
he
read
it
carefully
then
he
said
it
is
well
done
but
it
does
not
go
far
enough
you
have
put
down
king
as
reigning
and
you
have
written
william
as
the
heir
to
the
throne
but
who
should
follow
him
the
little
girl
hesitated
then
she
said
i
hardly
liked
to
put
down
myself
one
story
of
the
way
the
announcement
was
made
to
the
princess
was
written
nearly
forty
years
after
the
event
by
her
strict
and
adoring
governess
but
it
makes
her
out
such
a
priggish
pharisaical
little
moralizer
that
one
can
not
help
fancying
that
the
devoted
woman
unconsciously
put
into
the
mouth
of
her
idol
the
speeches
that
seemed
to
her
appropriate
not
to
the
child
but
to
the
occasion
she
says
that
when
the
princess
was
told
of
her
position
she
declared
many
a
child
would
boast
but
they
do
know
the
difficulty
there
is
much
splendor
but
there
is
more
responsibility
then
the
governess
reminded
her
that
if
her
aunt
adelaide
should
have
children
they
would
be
the
ones
to
ascend
the
throne
according
to
this
account
the
child
answered
if
it
were
so
i
should
be
very
glad
for
i
know
by
the
love
aunt
adelaide
bears
me
how
fond
she
is
of
children
it
seems
probable
that
after
the
princess
had
been
told
what
lay
before
her
miss
lehzen
made
speeches
somewhat
like
these
and
that
the
conscientious
little
girl
assented
to
them
davys
told
the
duchess
about
the
chart
and
she
wrote
at
once
to
the
bishop
of
london
that
the
princess
now
understood
her
position
the
letter
ended
we
have
everything
to
hope
from
this
child
illustration
the
princess
victoria
at
the
age
of
eleven
it
must
have
given
the
little
girl
of
eleven
years
a
strange
feeling
to
read
a
chart
of
sovereigns
of
her
country
and
know
that
her
own
name
would
be
written
in
the
next
vacant
place
she
had
seen
the
deference
paid
to
uncle
king
she
knew
that
his
will
was
law
and
it
must
have
made
the
child
brain
whirl
to
think
some
day
i
shall
be
in
his
place
she
had
always
been
trained
to
the
most
strict
obedience
but
she
knew
that
some
day
whatever
order
she
chose
to
give
would
be
obeyed
she
seems
to
have
thought
more
of
the
responsibility
of
the
throne
than
of
its
glories
but
if
she
had
felt
ever
so
much
inclined
to
boast
she
would
soon
have
realized
that
after
all
she
was
only
a
little
girl
who
must
obey
rather
than
command
for
the
first
consequence
of
her
queenly
prospects
was
an
examination
in
her
lessons
before
two
learned
bishops
the
duchess
believed
that
the
training
of
the
future
queen
was
the
most
important
matter
in
the
country
she
could
hardly
have
helped
feeling
that
she
had
been
most
successful
in
her
efforts
to
make
the
child
what
she
ought
to
be
but
after
all
she
herself
was
a
german
her
child
was
to
rule
an
english
realm
and
the
careful
mother
wished
to
make
sure
that
the
little
girl
was
having
the
kind
of
instruction
that
would
best
prepare
her
for
the
difficult
position
she
would
have
to
fill
she
selected
two
bishops
as
her
advisers
men
of
much
learning
and
fine
character
and
wrote
them
a
long
letter
about
the
princess
she
told
them
what
masters
had
been
chosen
for
her
and
in
what
branch
each
one
had
instructed
her
she
enclosed
a
list
of
the
books
the
princess
had
read
a
record
of
every
lesson
she
had
taken
and
the
schedule
of
her
study
hours
she
said
that
she
herself
had
been
present
at
almost
every
lesson
and
that
miss
lehzen
whose
special
task
it
was
to
assist
the
little
girl
in
preparing
her
work
for
the
different
masters
was
always
in
attendance
with
this
letter
went
a
report
from
each
instructor
stating
not
only
what
books
she
had
used
but
what
his
opinion
was
of
her
progress
and
ability
although
there
was
so
much
temptation
to
use
flattery
these
reports
seem
to
have
been
written
with
remarkable
sincerity
and
truthfulness
the
writing
master
said
that
his
pupil
had
a
peculiar
talent
for
arithmetic
but
he
was
apparently
not
quite
satisfied
with
her
handwriting
for
he
closed
with
the
sentence
if
the
princess
endeavors
to
imitate
her
writing
examples
her
success
is
certain
the
teacher
of
german
wrote
her
orthography
is
now
tolerably
correct
but
he
did
not
show
the
least
enthusiasm
over
his
statement
there
is
no
doubt
of
her
knowing
the
leading
rules
of
the
german
language
quite
well
though
surely
this
was
no
small
acquisition
for
a
child
of
eleven
the
french
teacher
declared
that
her
pronunciation
was
perfect
that
she
was
well
advanced
in
knowledge
of
french
grammar
and
could
carry
on
a
conversation
in
french
but
that
she
spoke
better
than
she
wrote
he
added
the
princess
is
much
further
advanced
than
is
usually
the
case
with
children
of
her
age
davys
with
his
great
love
for
his
little
pupil
seems
to
have
had
a
struggle
with
himself
to
keep
from
speaking
of
her
as
warmly
as
he
longed
to
speak
but
he
did
allow
himself
to
say
at
the
close
of
his
report
it
is
my
expectation
that
the
disposition
and
attainments
of
the
princess
will
be
such
as
to
gratify
the
anxious
wishes
as
well
as
to
reward
the
earnest
exertions
with
which
your
royal
highness
has
watched
over
the
education
of
the
princess
these
honest
straightforward
reports
were
sent
to
the
two
bishops
the
duchess
asked
them
to
read
the
papers
carefully
and
then
examine
the
singularly
situated
child
as
she
called
the
princess
to
see
whether
she
had
made
as
much
progress
as
she
should
have
done
and
in
what
respects
they
would
suggest
any
change
of
method
and
teaching
three
weeks
after
the
letter
was
written
the
two
bishops
went
to
kensington
and
examined
the
little
maiden
in
scripture
catechism
english
history
latin
and
arithmetic
both
were
gentle
kindly
men
and
both
had
little
children
of
their
own
evidently
they
knew
how
to
question
the
royal
child
in
such
a
fashion
that
she
was
not
startled
or
made
too
nervous
to
do
her
best
for
one
of
them
wrote
in
his
journal
about
the
examination
the
result
was
very
satisfactory
the
bishops
went
home
from
kensington
and
three
days
later
they
sent
the
anxious
mother
a
report
of
the
interview
they
wrote
that
they
had
asked
the
princess
a
great
variety
of
questions
and
that
her
answers
showed
she
had
learned
with
the
understanding
as
well
as
with
the
memory
they
were
so
well
pleased
with
the
results
of
their
visit
they
said
that
they
had
no
change
to
recommend
in
the
course
which
had
been
pursued
so
it
was
that
the
little
girl
began
her
public
life
not
by
congratulations
and
entertainments
and
rejoicings
but
by
a
thorough
examination
in
her
studies
before
two
learned
men
two
months
after
the
bishops
visit
to
kensington
the
princess
passed
her
eleventh
birthday
one
month
later
uncle
king
died
and
uncle
william
became
sovereign
with
the
title
of
william
iv
at
death
victoria
would
become
queen
and
as
that
event
might
occur
before
she
was
eighteen
and
capable
of
ruling
for
herself
it
was
necessary
to
have
a
guardian
appointed
at
once
so
that
if
it
should
come
to
pass
there
would
be
no
delay
in
matters
of
state
a
law
was
proposed
in
parliament
called
the
regency
bill
as
it
was
possible
that
william
would
have
a
child
victoria
was
spoken
of
as
the
heir
presumptive
that
is
the
one
who
is
presumed
or
expected
to
be
the
heir
although
with
a
possibility
of
changes
that
would
put
someone
else
before
her
the
bill
provided
that
if
she
should
come
to
the
crown
before
she
was
eighteen
her
mother
should
be
her
guardian
and
should
rule
the
country
in
her
name
until
she
was
of
age
this
bill
became
a
law
and
few
laws
have
been
so
pleasing
to
both
houses
of
parliament
and
to
the
whole
country
speeches
were
made
by
prominent
statesmen
praising
the
duchess
of
kent
and
her
manner
of
training
her
little
daughter
the
grandmother
in
coburg
wrote
may
god
bless
and
protect
our
little
darling
and
the
whole
country
echoed
the
prayer
when
parliament
was
prorogued
or
closed
until
the
next
session
the
princess
was
with
her
aunt
adelaide
who
was
now
the
queen
they
stood
together
at
one
of
the
palace
windows
watching
the
procession
while
the
people
shouted
hurrah
for
queen
adelaide
long
live
the
queen
then
the
loving
aunt
took
the
little
girl
by
the
hand
and
led
her
out
on
the
balcony
so
that
all
might
see
her
the
people
cheered
louder
than
before
not
only
for
the
princess
but
for
the
generous
woman
who
had
not
a
thought
of
jealousy
because
it
was
the
child
of
her
friend
and
not
one
of
her
own
little
girls
that
stood
by
her
side
king
william
was
fond
of
the
child
but
he
did
not
like
the
mother
the
duchess
always
spoke
of
him
with
respect
and
kindness
but
she
contrived
to
have
her
own
way
in
bringing
up
her
daughter
and
she
was
so
that
she
could
usually
prove
though
in
a
most
courteous
and
deferential
manner
that
he
was
in
the
wrong
he
was
very
indignant
that
victoria
was
not
allowed
to
spend
time
at
court
but
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
say
when
the
mother
quietly
took
the
ground
that
the
little
girl
was
not
strong
enough
for
the
excitements
of
court
life
soon
after
his
accession
he
sent
the
prime
minister
to
the
duchess
to
express
his
opinion
that
the
education
of
the
heir
presumptive
ought
to
be
in
charge
of
some
clergyman
of
high
rank
in
the
church
and
not
in
that
of
the
minister
of
a
little
country
parish
the
duchess
replied
with
the
utmost
courtesy
convey
to
his
majesty
my
gratitude
she
said
to
the
prime
minister
for
the
interest
that
he
has
manifested
say
to
him
that
i
agree
with
him
perfectly
that
the
education
of
the
princess
ought
to
be
intrusted
to
a
dignitary
of
the
church
then
she
added
i
have
every
ground
for
being
satisfied
with
davys
and
i
think
there
can
be
no
reason
why
he
should
not
be
placed
in
as
high
a
position
as
his
majesty
could
wish
king
william
must
have
raged
when
he
received
the
message
but
he
was
helpless
and
there
was
really
nothing
to
do
but
to
follow
the
suggestion
of
the
duchess
this
was
done
and
davys
became
dean
of
chester
one
other
official
was
however
added
to
the
household
of
the
princess
a
state
governess
the
duchess
of
northumberland
her
business
was
to
attend
the
royal
child
on
all
state
occasions
and
to
teach
her
the
details
of
court
etiquette
that
were
to
be
observed
this
lady
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
education
of
the
princess
in
any
other
respect
and
miss
lehzen
remained
her
governess
as
before
miss
lehzen
or
baroness
lehzen
for
king
george
had
made
her
a
german
baroness
was
a
finely
educated
woman
the
daughter
of
a
german
clergyman
she
had
come
to
england
with
the
duchess
of
kent
as
governess
to
the
princess
féodore
and
she
had
performed
her
duties
so
satisfactorily
that
the
duchess
was
glad
to
be
able
to
place
the
princess
victoria
in
her
charge
she
was
a
woman
of
keen
sagacious
judgment
with
the
ability
to
see
everything
that
was
going
on
about
her
and
not
at
all
afraid
to
express
her
opinions
one
day
when
an
of
one
of
the
royal
dukes
was
presented
to
her
she
greeted
him
with
the
frank
speech
i
can
see
that
you
are
not
a
fop
or
a
dandy
as
most
of
your
guardsmen
are
she
was
severe
in
her
manner
but
her
bluntest
speeches
were
made
with
such
a
friendly
glance
of
her
shrewd
and
kindly
eyes
that
most
people
who
met
her
became
like
the
her
loyal
friends
many
years
later
her
former
pupil
said
of
her
i
adored
her
though
i
was
greatly
in
awe
of
her
she
really
seemed
to
have
no
thought
but
for
me
the
education
of
the
schoolgirl
princess
went
on
in
much
the
same
way
as
during
the
previous
years
her
study
hours
were
observed
with
such
strictness
that
even
when
a
favored
guest
at
kensington
was
about
to
take
his
departure
she
was
not
allowed
to
leave
her
work
for
a
moment
to
say
occasionally
however
an
interruption
came
and
three
months
before
she
was
twelve
years
of
age
the
books
had
to
be
closed
for
one
day
that
she
might
make
her
first
appearance
at
queen
adelaide
drawing
room
she
wore
a
white
dress
hardly
more
elaborate
than
her
ordinary
gowns
but
a
diamond
ornament
was
in
her
hair
and
around
her
neck
was
a
string
of
pearls
she
stood
beside
the
queen
and
although
the
ceremonies
were
almost
as
unwonted
to
her
as
they
would
have
been
to
any
other
child
of
her
age
she
did
not
appear
embarrassed
but
seemed
to
enjoy
her
new
experience
baroness
lehzen
wrote
a
letter
to
a
friend
about
this
time
describing
the
little
girl
she
said
my
princess
will
be
twelve
years
old
she
is
not
tall
but
very
pretty
has
dark
blue
eyes
and
a
mouth
which
though
not
tiny
is
very
and
pleasant
very
fine
teeth
a
small
but
graceful
figure
and
a
very
small
foot
her
whole
bearing
is
so
childish
and
engaging
that
one
could
not
desire
a
more
amiable
child
the
baroness
seems
to
have
just
returned
from
some
absence
when
she
wrote
the
letter
for
she
adds
she
was
dressed
to
receive
me
in
white
muslin
with
a
coral
necklace
during
this
year
while
the
glories
of
victoria
brilliant
future
were
beginning
to
shine
faintly
about
her
the
first
sorrows
of
her
life
came
to
her
in
the
death
of
her
grandmother
of
coburg
and
the
departure
of
her
uncle
leopold
for
belgium
the
year
before
he
had
been
asked
to
become
king
of
greece
but
had
refused
now
the
throne
of
belgium
was
offered
him
and
he
accepted
it
the
happiest
days
of
the
little
niece
had
been
spent
with
him
and
the
child
who
in
spite
of
her
royal
birth
had
so
few
pleasures
was
sadly
grieved
at
his
departure
all
her
life
he
had
been
her
devoted
friend
always
near
and
always
ready
to
do
anything
to
please
her
child
as
she
was
she
knew
enough
of
thrones
and
sovereigns
to
understand
that
the
visits
of
kings
and
queens
must
be
few
and
far
between
and
that
she
could
never
again
have
the
delightful
times
of
her
earlier
years
the
coronation
of
king
william
took
place
in
september
but
neither
the
duchess
nor
the
princess
was
present
no
one
knew
the
reason
of
their
absence
and
therefore
all
sorts
of
stories
were
spread
abroad
the
princess
is
not
strong
enough
to
attend
so
long
and
wearisome
a
ceremonial
said
one
her
mother
keeps
her
away
to
spite
the
king
declared
another
and
yet
another
reason
assigned
and
this
was
probably
the
true
one
was
that
the
princess
was
not
allowed
to
go
because
the
king
had
refused
to
give
her
the
place
in
the
procession
which
her
rank
and
position
demanded
whatever
reason
may
have
been
the
correct
one
the
princess
remained
at
home
but
she
did
some
little
traveling
during
the
summer
it
was
only
around
the
western
part
of
the
isle
of
wight
but
to
the
child
whose
journeys
until
the
previous
season
had
been
hardly
more
than
from
kensington
to
london
or
to
claremont
these
little
trips
were
full
of
interest
the
following
summer
brought
much
more
of
travel
not
only
the
king
but
the
people
of
the
kingdom
in
general
were
beginning
to
feel
somewhat
aggrieved
that
so
little
was
seen
of
the
princess
the
duchess
believed
that
the
best
way
for
the
future
queen
to
know
her
realm
was
to
see
it
and
that
the
best
way
to
win
the
loyalty
of
her
future
subjects
was
for
them
to
see
her
she
thought
that
her
daughter
was
now
old
enough
to
enjoy
and
appreciate
journeys
through
the
country
these
journeys
were
not
lengthy
for
the
travelers
did
not
leave
england
except
for
a
short
stay
at
anglesey
but
they
could
hardly
fail
to
be
of
interest
to
a
girl
of
thirteen
who
wanted
to
see
things
and
know
things
the
general
course
of
their
travel
was
from
kensington
to
the
northwest
and
its
limit
was
the
little
island
of
anglesey
of
course
the
child
who
had
not
been
allowed
to
leave
a
haycock
unfinished
lest
she
should
develop
a
tendency
to
leave
things
incomplete
was
not
permitted
to
make
an
expedition
like
this
without
a
vast
amount
of
instruction
she
was
required
to
keep
a
journal
and
she
was
seldom
allowed
to
look
upon
the
manufacture
of
any
article
without
listening
to
an
explanation
of
the
process
it
speaks
well
for
her
intelligence
and
her
wish
to
learn
that
she
seems
to
have
been
genuinely
interested
in
these
explanations
she
found
a
tiny
model
of
a
cotton
loom
as
fascinating
as
most
children
would
find
a
new
toy
and
she
was
never
weary
of
watching
the
manufacture
of
nails
as
a
memento
of
the
visit
to
the
she
carried
away
with
the
greatest
delight
a
little
gold
box
that
they
had
presented
to
her
within
the
box
was
a
quill
and
in
the
quill
was
a
vast
number
of
nails
of
all
varieties
but
so
tiny
that
they
could
hardly
be
seen
without
a
magnifying
glass
other
gifts
were
made
her
at
the
university
press
she
was
presented
with
a
richly
bound
bible
and
a
piece
of
white
satin
on
which
was
printed
a
glowing
account
of
her
visit
here
in
oxford
she
was
enthusiastic
in
her
enjoyment
of
the
bodleian
library
one
thing
in
this
library
interested
her
especially
a
book
of
latin
exercises
in
which
queen
elizabeth
wrote
when
she
was
thirteen
just
the
age
of
the
princess
of
course
the
little
visitor
compared
her
own
handwriting
with
that
of
elizabeth
and
the
thought
must
have
passed
through
her
mind
that
some
day
her
exercises
and
copybooks
would
perhaps
be
put
into
libraries
to
be
looked
at
as
she
was
looking
at
queen
elizabeth
other
events
than
receiving
gifts
and
studying
manufactures
came
into
those
weeks
of
travel
the
princess
laid
the
corner
stone
of
a
school
she
planted
a
little
oak
tree
on
the
estate
of
one
of
her
entertainers
in
anglesey
she
presented
the
prizes
at
the
national
eisteddfod
a
musical
and
literary
festival
which
had
been
celebrated
annually
from
ancient
times
she
listened
to
addresses
without
number
from
mayors
and
vice
chancellors
and
she
was
present
at
the
formal
opening
of
the
new
bridge
over
the
dee
which
for
this
reason
was
named
the
victoria
bridge
one
thing
which
seems
to
have
made
a
special
impression
upon
the
child
mind
and
which
she
noted
particularly
in
her
journal
was
that
she
was
allowed
to
dine
with
her
mother
and
the
guests
at
seven
traveling
in
those
days
was
quite
a
different
matter
from
making
a
journey
one
or
two
short
railroads
had
been
built
in
england
but
it
was
many
years
too
early
for
the
comfortable
rapid
express
trains
of
the
present
time
and
the
journeys
of
the
princess
were
made
entirely
by
carriage
she
had
set
off
for
kensington
with
a
little
company
of
attendants
very
few
indeed
considering
her
position
as
heir
presumptive
but
it
was
hardly
possible
without
offending
the
loyal
people
of
the
places
through
which
they
passed
to
refuse
the
honors
which
were
shown
to
her
and
her
mother
and
the
requests
of
the
yeomanry
of
various
counties
that
begged
the
privilege
of
escorting
them
in
the
days
of
queen
elizabeth
that
lover
of
gorgeousness
used
to
make
journeys
about
her
kingdom
that
were
regarded
as
an
excuse
for
all
magnificence
and
lavishness
these
were
called
progresses
and
now
king
william
often
jested
about
little
victoria
royal
progresses
he
was
not
exactly
pleased
however
and
he
kept
a
somewhat
jealous
watch
of
the
honors
that
were
paid
to
her
the
next
year
the
princess
and
her
mother
spent
considerable
time
in
their
yacht
and
the
king
had
a
fresh
cause
of
annoyance
in
the
fact
that
now
they
were
greeted
not
only
with
addresses
but
with
the
firing
of
guns
he
could
not
endure
that
anyone
but
himself
should
receive
the
royal
salutes
the
thing
is
not
legal
he
said
to
the
naval
authorities
stop
those
poppings
the
naval
authorities
respectfully
insisted
that
the
thing
legal
the
king
had
not
learned
wisdom
from
his
previous
encounters
with
the
duchess
of
kent
and
in
his
dilemma
he
actually
tried
to
compel
her
to
refuse
to
accept
the
salutes
the
dignified
lady
replied
with
all
courtesy
if
the
king
wishes
to
offer
me
a
slight
in
the
face
of
the
people
he
can
offer
it
so
easily
that
he
should
not
ask
me
to
make
the
task
easier
king
william
was
fairly
worsted
but
he
would
not
yield
he
called
the
privy
council
and
ordered
them
to
pass
an
order
that
even
the
royal
flag
should
not
be
saluted
unless
the
vessel
flying
it
bore
either
the
king
or
the
queen
to
turn
from
royal
salutes
and
mayors
addresses
and
the
laying
of
to
playing
with
dolls
is
a
little
startling
but
such
was
the
course
of
the
princess
life
she
was
heir
to
the
throne
and
she
could
bestow
prizes
and
receive
delegations
and
meet
the
eager
gaze
of
thousands
without
being
at
all
troubled
or
embarrassed
but
she
was
a
child
for
all
that
she
was
not
allowed
to
sit
at
the
table
when
her
mother
gave
an
elaborate
dinner
party
for
the
king
and
she
still
retained
her
liking
for
the
dolls
that
her
lack
of
playmates
had
made
so
dear
to
her
there
is
now
in
existence
a
little
copybook
on
which
is
written
list
of
my
dolls
by
their
number
and
their
interest
they
certainly
deserve
the
honor
of
being
catalogued
even
at
the
present
time
for
there
were
of
them
and
they
were
often
dressed
to
imitate
noted
persons
of
the
day
most
of
them
were
little
wooden
creatures
from
three
to
nine
inches
high
with
sharply
pointed
noses
cheeks
red
as
a
cherry
in
some
one
spot
wherever
the
brush
of
the
maker
had
chanced
to
hit
jet
black
hair
and
the
most
convenient
joints
that
enabled
the
small
bodies
to
be
arranged
in
many
attitudes
the
men
dolls
had
small
black
mustaches
and
the
women
dolls
were
distinguished
by
little
yellow
painted
on
the
black
dab
which
represented
their
hair
the
baby
dolls
were
made
of
rags
upon
which
comical
little
faces
were
painted
the
fascination
of
these
dolls
does
not
lie
in
their
beauty
but
in
their
wardrobes
most
of
them
were
dressed
between
and
or
when
the
princess
was
from
twelve
to
fourteen
years
old

the
conscientious
little
owner
of

marked
carefully
which
ones
she
herself
dressed
and
in
which
she
was
helped
by
the
baroness
lehzen
the
wardrobes
of
were
made
entirely
by
the
fingers
of
the
little
girl
and
remembering
the
schedule
of
studies
it
is
a
wonder
how
she
found
the
time
one
hopes
that
at
least
the
hour
marked
needlework
and
learning
poetry
by
heart
was
sometimes
devoted
to
this
purpose
though
how
any
old
or
young
could
learn
poetry
with
a
court
costume
on
her
hands
is
a
mystery
it
is
equally
a
mystery
how
even
the
most
skillful
of
childish
fingers
could
manufacture
such
tiny
ruffles
and
finish
aprons
with
microscopic
pockets

were

the
princess
had
a
long
board
full
of
pegs
into
which
the
feet
of
these
little
favorites
of
hers
fitted
and
here
she
rehearsed
dramas
and
operas
and
pantomimes
even
in
her
play
with
dolls
however
she
could
not
be
entirely
free
from
the
burden
of
her
destiny
for
sometimes
they
were
used
by
the
state
governess
to
explain
court
ceremonials
and
teach
the
etiquette
of
various
occasions
when
the
princess
was
fully
fourteen
the
dolls
were
packed
away
though
no
one
guessed
how
soon
the
little
owner
would
be
called
upon
to
decide
not
the
color
of
a
doll
gown
but
the
fate
of
men
and
women
and
the
weighty
questions

years
from
to

eighteenth
birthday
on
may
her
life
was
sometimes
that
of
a
child
sometimes
that
of
a
young
woman
much
of
the
time
she
lived
quietly
at
kensington
she
studied
rode
walked
sketched
and
played
with
her
various
pets
when
her
fourteenth
birthday
came
she
was
for
a
few
hours
treated
like
a
for
at
a
juvenile
ball
given
in
her
honor
king
william
led
her
into
the
room
and
at
supper
her
health
was
drunk
by
the
whole
company
during
the
following
summer
there
was
more
of
the
educational
traveling
in
which
the
duchess
believed
so
firmly
and
which
gave
so
much
pleasure
to
the
people
of
the
country
this
summer
the
princess
and
her
mother
visited
chiefly
forts
arsenals
lighthouses
and
on
shipboard
they
delighted
the
men
by
tasting
their
dinner
and
the
sailors
in
return
amused
them
by
dancing
a
hornpipe
addresses
were
made
the
princess
presented
new
colors
to
a
regiment
a
procession
of
young
girls
with
flowers
and
a
crown
met
the
royal
guests
at
one
town
whose
trade
was
chiefly
in
straw
the
princess
was
presented
with
a
straw
bonnet
wherever
she
went
her
charming
grace
and
cordiality
and
readiness
to
be
pleased
won
her
lasting
friendships
throughout
the
land
there
was
talk
about
the
quiet
young
girl
at
kensington
king
william
was
growing
feeble
for
half
a
century
england
had
been
ruled
by
elderly
men
how
would
it
fare
in
the
hands
of
a
young
girl
victoria
was
not
as
well
as
she
had
been
and
there
were
rumors
that
she
would
not
be
equal
to
the
labors
of
sovereignty
baroness
lehzen
was
indignant
at
the
least
criticism
the
princess
is
not
too
delicate
and
she
is
not
too
young
declared
the
lady
with
her
wonted
emphasis
i
know
all
about
her
and
she
will
make
a
greater
queen
than
elizabeth
herself
an
interesting
man
visited
the
princess
at
this
time
baron
stockmar
who
had
long
been
a
trusted
friend
of
king
leopold
he
was
the
only
honest
man
i
ever
saw
said
a
statesman
who
knew
him
well
and
king
william
was
eager
to
hear
stockmar
opinion
of
the
young
princess
the
baron
had
no
hesitation
in
expressing
it
if
she
were
a
nobody
he
said
i
should
say
she
is
gifted
with
an
intelligence
beyond
her
years
but
being
destined
to
rule
over
this
great
empire
i
say
that
england
will
grow
great
and
famous
under
her
rule
do
you
say
that
exclaimed
the
king
then
i
shall
no
longer
regret
that
i
have
no
children
to
hand
the
crown
down
to
and
yet
some
months
after
this
speech
was
made
the
young
woman
who
was
to
make
england
great
and
famous
was
sent
to
bed
after
dancing
just
one
dance
at
a
grand
ball
given
in
her
honor
the
health
of
the
girl
was
too
precious
in
the
eyes
of
the
duchess
to
be
wasted
in
late
hours
soon
after
her
sixteenth
birthday
the
princess
was
confirmed
the
ceremony
was
performed
in
the
chapel
of
james
and
none
were
present
except
members
of
the
royal
family
even
as
a
child
victoria
had
often
shown
great
but
when
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
spoke
to
her
tenderly
indeed
but
with
deep
solemnity
of
the
responsibilities
of
the
life
that
lay
before
her
of
what
good
or
what
harm
a
single
word
or
deed
of
hers
might
cause
then
the
earnest
conscientious
young
girl
could
not
remain
unmoved
she
laid
her
head
on
her
mother
shoulder
and
sobbed
like
a
little
child
the
wisdom
of
the
watchful
mother
care
was
made
manifest
in
the
increasing
health
and
strength
of
the
princess
she
was
seen
in
public
far
more
frequently
the
little
girl
had
become
a
young
lady
the
plain
little
white
dresses
were
laid
aside
and
she
now
appeared
in
garments
as
rich
and
handsome
as
were
permitted
to
her
youth
one
costume
that
she
wore
a
pink
satin
gown
and
a
large
pink
bonnet
was
the
special
delight
of
those
of
her
future
subjects
who
had
the
good
fortune
to
see
her
in
it
this
was
what
she
wore
when
a
young
american
author
gazed
upon
her
admiringly
and
then
went
away
to
moralize
over
the
sad
fate
of
royalty
she
will
be
sold
he
said
bartered
away
by
those
great
dealers
in
royal
hearts
it
was
true
that
dealers
in
royal
hearts
had
long
before
this
laid
their
plans
for
the
disposal
of
the
princess
affections
king
william
had
proposed
five
suitors
one
after
another
but
his
polite
and
exasperating
had
courteously
waived
all
his
suggestions
another
scheme
had
been
formed
across
the
water
by
the
coburg
grandmother
nearly
seventeen
years
earlier
there
was
a
baby
granddaughter
in
england
and
a
baby
grandson
in
coburg
if
they
would
only
be
as
fond
of
each
other
as
the
grandmother
was
of
them
not
a
word
was
said
to
the
little
english
girl
but
there
is
a
tradition
that
when
the
grandson
was
but
three
years
old
his
nurse
used
to
say
be
a
good
boy
now
prince
albert
and
some
day
you
shall
go
to
england
and
marry
the
queen
however
the
truth
of
this
story
may
be
it
is
certain
that
not
only
the
grandmother
but
king
leopold
earnestly
hoped
that
some
day
the
prince
might
marry
the
princess
when
the
cousins
were
seventeen
years
old
king
leopold
thought
that
the
time
had
come
for
them
to
meet
but
the
wise
sovereign
had
no
idea
of
exposing
his
little
niece
to
the
fascinations
of
a
young
man
who
might
not
be
worthy
of
her
and
he
sent
the
faithful
baron
stockmar
to
learn
all
that
he
could
about
the
character
of
the
prince
the
report
was
as
favorable
as
the
devoted
uncle
could
have
wished
and
he
at
once
persuaded
the
duchess
to
invite
prince
albert
and
his
brother
to
spend
a
month
at
kensington
the
two
young
men
arrived
and
were
most
royally
entertained
such
a
round
of
parties
balls
receptions
dinners
all
sorts
of
festivities
they
had
never
seen
prince
albert
was
just
a
little
bored
by
so
much
gayety
and
acknowledged
in
his
home
letters
that
he
had
many
hard
battles
to
fight
against
sleepiness
he
seems
to
have
found
more
pleasure
in
the
quiet
hours
of
walking
sketching
and
playing
piano
duets
with
the
little
cousin
after
the
brothers
had
taken
their
departure
king
leopold
wrote
his
niece
telling
her
very
frankly
of
his
hopes
she
replied
at
once
and
with
equal
frankness
one
can
not
help
seeing
that
the
two
cousins
had
become
deeply
interested
in
each
other
for
the
letter
of
the
princess
begs
her
uncle
to
take
special
care
of
one
now
so
dear
to
me
and
closes
with
the
words
i
hope
and
trust
that
all
will
go
on
prosperously
and
well
on
this
subject
now
of
so
much
importance
to
me
there
were
subjects
however
concerning
which
all
did
not
go
on
prosperously
and
well
the
princess
loved
her
devoted
mother
with
all
her
warm
heart
and
she
also
loved
uncle
william
who
was
always
good
to
her
she
was
now
so
old
that
the
friction
between
them
could
no
longer
be
concealed
from
her
the
king
special
grievance
was
that
she
was
not
allowed
to
visit
him
save
at
rare
intervals
the
sailor
king
was
a
favorite
among
his
people
because
he
was
bluff
and
cheery
and
witty
but
his
wit
was
often
coarse
and
his
good
nature
not
infrequently
turned
into
a
swearing
rage
when
his
humor
changed
there
were
certainly
good
reasons
why
the
young
girl
should
have
been
kept
from
his
court
and
he
was
keen
enough
to
see
that
the
duchess
had
other
grounds
than
care
of
her
daughter
health
for
refusing
to
allow
her
to
visit
him
his
gentle
stately
had
outwitted
him
in
every
encounter
and
at
last
his
wrath
burst
forth
the
time
was
a
state
dinner
which
he
gave
in
honor
of
his
birthday
in
his
speech
to
the
guests
he
lost
all
control
of
himself
and
declared
i
hope
that
my
life
may
be
spared
nine
months
longer
after
which
period
in
event
of
my
death
no
regency
will
take
place
i
shall
then
have
the
satisfaction
of
leaving
the
royal
authority
to
the
personal
exercise
of
that
young
lady
here
the
king
looked
at
the
princess
victoria
then
glaring
at
the
duchess
he
roared
and
not
in
the
hands
of
a
person
now
near
to
me
he
went
on
like
a
madman
heaping
every
kind
of
abuse
upon
the
duchess
and
declaring
that
she
had
insulted
him
by
keeping
the
princess
from
his
presence
the
duchess
sat
like
marble
but
her
daughter
burst
into
tears
at
last
the
dinner
came
to
an
end
and
the
duchess
ordered
her
carriage
that
she
and
the
princess
might
leave
at
once
instead
of
spending
the
night
but
queen
adelaide
interposed
stay
she
said
stay
i
beg
of
you
the
king
is
ill
he
is
not
himself
and
she
whispered
you
have
borne
so
much
bear
a
little
more
the
duchess
yielded
and
remained
at
the
palace
until
morning
the
nine
months
passed
rapidly
and
the
morning
of
may
arrived
the
princess
was
now
eighteen
and
the
whole
land
celebrated
her
coming
of
age
the
day
began
with
a
serenade
under
her
window
by
a
band
of
musicians
one
of
the
songs
commenced
spring
renews
its
golden
dreams
sweet
birds
carol
each
spray
shed
o
sun
thy
milder
beams
on
the
fairest
flower
of
may
the
princess
was
delighted
with
this
serenade
but
the
only
song
that
she
asked
to
have
repeated
was
one
that
was
full
of
compliments
to
her
mother
the
union
jack
had
already
been
hoisted
on
the
church
in
kensington
and
its
greeting
was
responded
to
from
the
palace
by
a
banner
of
white
silk
whereon
was
victoria
in
letters
of
blue
almost
every
house
had
its
flag
or
its
bit
of
decoration
of
some
sort
the
king
sent
a
birthday
gift
of
a
handsome
piano
and
that
was
only
the
beginning
for
all
day
long
costly
presents
were
arriving
addresses
of
congratulation
were
sent
by
numerous
cities
and
by
many
public
bodies
and
the
house
was
thronged
with
callers
the
greatest
nobles
of
the
kingdom
the
people
of
most
wealth
and
the
greatest
statesmen
hastened
to
kensington
to
give
their
best
wishes
to
the
young
girl
in
the
evening
a
state
ball
the
most
splendid
affair
of
the
kind
that
had
been
known
was
given
for
her
at
the
palace
of
james
but
the
illness
of
the
king
kept
both
him
and
queen
adelaide
away
from
the
festivities
between
the
dances
the
princess
was
escorted
to
the
chair
of
state
before
this
the
duchess
had
always
stood
first
but
now
the
young
girl
who
was
to
rule
england
took
precedence
of
even
her
mother
the
way
of
the
princess
to
the
throne
seemed
very
clear
but
there
was
one
man
in
england
who
was
determined
that
she
should
never
reach
it
he
was
the
duke
of
cumberland
victoria
uncle
he
was
the
next
younger
brother
of
the
duke
of
kent
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
birth
of
his
niece
the
throne
of
england
would
have
been
his
own
at
that
time
the
sovereign
of
england
was
also
ruler
of
hanover
but
hanover
had
a
law
called
the
salic
law
which
forbade
any
woman
to
be
its
monarch
two
or
three
years
earlier
the
duke
of
cumberland
had
confided
to
an
english
officer
his
desire
to
gain
the
crown
the
salic
law
prevents
the
princess
victoria
from
ruling
hanover
he
said
and
therefore
she
has
no
right
to
rule
england
if
i
should
be
proclaimed
king
would
you
and
your
troop
follow
me
through
london
yes
and
to
the
tower
the
next
day
the
officer
answered
indignantly
what
will
the
princess
do
for
you
demanded
the
duke
if
i
were
king
i
could
make
you
a
great
man
but
this
is
nothing
i
only
asked
to
see
what
you
would
say
the
duke
was
in
earnest
however
so
much
in
earnest
that
he
even
ventured
to
allow
his
wishes
to
become
known
to
king
william
one
day
when
the
two
brothers
were
dining
together
the
duke
proposed
the
toast
the
king
health
god
save
the
king
this
was
drunk
and
then
the
duke
proposed
a
second
toast
the
king
heir
god
bless
him
both
the
brothers
had
drunk
too
much
but
king
william
was
equal
to
the
occasion
he
called
out
drink
to
the
king
heir
god
bless
and
the
toast
was
drunk
by
all
except
the
duke
nevertheless
the
duke
of
cumberland
did
not
give
up
his
wild
scheme
he
knew
that
he
himself
was
by
no
means
a
favorite
in
england
and
that
he
had
no
friends
whose
devotion
would
place
him
upon
the
throne
but
he
fancied
that
he
could
arouse
opposition
to
the
princess
and
so
open
a
way
for
himself
to
become
sovereign
there
was
nothing
to
be
said
against
her
but
he
did
his
best
to
arouse
dislike
to
her
family
the
coburgs
are
the
people
who
have
influence
with
her
he
said
king
leopold
has
just
married
a
roman
catholic
princess
and
the
cousin
of
victoria
has
married
queen
maria
of
portugal
who
is
also
a
roman
catholic
king
william
can
not
live
long
and
england
will
have
on
its
throne
not
only
a
child
but
a
child
who
will
be
no
protestant
now
for
a
century
and
a
half
england
had
had
a
law
that
as
a
protestant
country
it
must
be
ruled
by
a
protestant
and
that
the
husband
or
wife
of
the
sovereign
must
also
be
a
protestant
if
victoria
had
become
a
roman
catholic
she
would
have
forfeited
the
throne
at
once
this
argument
of
the
duke
of
cumberland
was
therefore
almost
too
absurd
to
notice
but
england
was
too
loyal
to
the
young
girl
at
kensington
not
to
be
in
a
storm
of
indignation
even
then
the
duke
of
cumberland
fancied
that
he
might
still
have
a
chance
and
he
was
so
insane
as
to
go
to
that
sternly
loyal
old
soldier
the
duke
of
wellington
and
ask
what
he
thought
was
the
best
thing
to
do
to
do
cried
the
iron
duke
get
out
of
this
country
as
fast
as
you
can
and
take
care
you
do
get
pelted
as
you
go
in
less
than
a
month
after
the
eighteenth
birthday
of
the
princess
came
the
night
of
june
nineteenth
the
country
knew
that
king
william
was
dying
the
royal
life
guards
were
at
their
barracks
but
not
to
sleep
the
sentries
were
doubled
every
horse
was
saddled
and
by
it
stood
its
master
ready
to
race
to
windsor
to
guard
the
lifeless
body
of
the
king
or
to
gallop
to
kensington
to
escort
the
girl
queen
to
her
throne
all
that
night
the
officers
sat
in
the
messroom
and
talked
of
the
princess
i
saw
her
on
horseback
said
one
she
rides
superbly
but
she
looks
like
a
child
the
duke
of
sussex

the
little
ones
have
the
brains
remarked
another
she
a
queen
every
inch
of
her
one
declared
and
i
tell
you
that
england
is
going
to
be
greater
than
it
ever
was
before
she
a
soldier
daughter
too
king
william
was
a
sailor
he
could
not
have
held
a
review
to
save
his
what
that
the
young
man
broke
off
abruptly
for
the
gallop
of
a
horse
was
heard
in
the
courtyard
there
was
dead
silence
in
the
messroom
in
a
few
minutes
the
colonel
entered
he
held
up
his
hand
for
attention
but
he
did
not
need
to
do
this
for
every
ear
was
strained
gentlemen
he
said
king
william

the
lord
chamberlain
had
been
driving
at
full
speed
from
windsor
to
kensington
not
a
person
was
stirring
about
the
palace
and
the
only
sound
heard
was
the
singing
of
birds
the
two
men
rang
but
there
was
no
response
they
knocked
they
thumped
and
they
pounded
finally
a
very
sleepy
porter
opened
the
gate
and
let
them
into
one
of
the
lower
rooms
of
the
palace
no
one
came
to
them
and
at
last
they
rang
for
a
servant
tell
the
attendant
of
the
princess
victoria
said
the
lord
chamberlain
that
we
have
come
to
see
her
on
business
of
the
utmost
importance
the
servant
withdrew
but
no
one
appeared
they
rang
again
and
at
last
the
attendant
of
the
princess
came
to
them
the
princess
victoria
is
sleeping
she
said
and
she
must
not
be
awakened
then
said
the
lord
chamberlain
we
are

even
her
sleep
must
give
way
to
that
there
was

called
and
she
awoke
her
daughter

still
slept
in
a
bed
beside
her

she
said

on
a
long
white
dressing

at
the
door
for
her
mother
to
accompany
her

the
duchess
he
wishes
to

for
the
first
time
the
young
girl
was
required
to
stand
by
herself
and
as
she
stepped
over
the
threshold
she
left
all
her
free
girlish
life
behind
her
she
went
down
the
stairs
in
her
long
white
dressing
gown
with
her
fair
hair
falling
over
her
shoulders
as
she
entered
the
room
lord
conyngham
knelt
before
her
kissed
her
hand
and
presented
a
paper

formal
certificate
of

the
archbishop
said

wished
me
to
accompany
lord
conyngham
for
she
thought
that
you
would
be
glad
to
hear
how
peaceful
and
quiet
the
king
was
at
the
last
to
the
young
queen
the
sight
of
the
archbishop
brought
no
thought
of
the
glories
of
the
throne
but
rather
of
those
solemn
words
that
he
had
spoken
to
her
in
the
chapel
of
james
two
years
before
with
tears
in
her
eyes
she
said
to
him
i
beg
your
grace
to
pray
for
me
messengers
had
been
sent
to
the
members
of
the
privy
council
to
summon
them
to
immediate
attendance
at
kensington
when
they
arrived
they
were
shown
into
the
in
which
were
the
duke
of
sussex
uncle
of
the
queen
the
duke
of
wellington
lord
melbourne
the
prime
minister
and
a
few
others
the
doors
were
closed
and
an
address
of
loyalty
was
read
aloud
and
then
signed
by
all
present
in
the
great
saloon
adjoining
were
the
queen
and
her
mother
the
duchess
withdrew
and
when
the
doors
were
opened
there
stood
near
the
threshold
the
slender
figure
of
the
girl
queen
looking
even
slighter
and
younger
than
she
was
in
her
dress
of
black
silk
it
was
perfectly
plain
her
hair
was
parted
and
drawn
back
smoothly
from
her
forehead
and
she
wore
not
a
single
ornament
the
duke
of
sussex
stepped
forward
to
meet
her
put
his
arm
around
her
and
kissed
her
the
others
kissed
her
hand
the
address
was
given
to
the
usher
and
the
doors
between
the
two
rooms
were
closed
not
a
word
had
been
spoken
a
little
later
in
the
day
came
the
famous
first
council
lord
melbourne
had
told
the
queen
just
what
was
to
be
done
and
what
her
part
would
be
the
council
assembled
and
the
lord
president
read
the
formal
announcement
of
the
death
of
king
william
then
he
requested
the
prime
minister
and
several
others
to
go
to
the
queen
and
inform
her
also
of
the
king
death
this
was
done
with
as
much
ceremony
as
if
she
had
known
nothing
of
it
before
when
they
returned
the
proclamation
of
her
accession
was
read
then
the
doors
into
the
adjoining
saloon
were
thrown
open
and
the
queen
stepped
forward
wearing
a
plain
simple
mourning
dress
her
two
uncles
the
duke
of
cumberland
and
the
duke
of
sussex
went
forward
to
meet
her
and
led
her
into
the
room
at
the
end
of
a
long
table
a
platform
had
been
placed
and
on
the
platform
was
the
chair
of
state
the
queen
bowed
to
the
councilors
and
took
her
seat
in
this
chair
she
read
her
speech
at
once
clearly
and
with
as
much
calmness
and
dignity
as
her
mother
could
have
shown
it
closed
i
shall
steadily
protect
the
rights
and
promote
to
the
utmost
of
my
power
the
happiness
and
welfare
of
all
classes
of
my
subjects
she
signed
the
usual
oath
insuring
the
liberty
of
the
church
of
scotland
and
then
came
the
solemn
swearing
of
each
councilor
to
be
faithful
to
her
her
two
uncles
were
sworn
first
and
as
the
duke
of
cumberland
kissed
her
hand
she
blushed
as
any
other
young
girl
might
have
done
to
have
an
elderly
man
her
own
uncle
kneel
at
her
feet
she
kissed
him
and
also
the
duke
of
sussex
this
second
uncle
was
too
feeble
to
make
his
way
to
her
easily
and
she
rose
from
her
seat
and
stepped
toward
him
after
the
swearing
of
the
dukes
the
oath
was
taken
by
the
other
members
of
the
council
when
this
had
been
done
she
rose
and
left
the
room
led
by
her
two
uncles
never
were
men
more
surprised
than
these
experienced
councilors
who
thought
that
they
understood
all
kinds
of
people
and
knew
what
sort
of
behavior
to
expect
from
them
i
am
amazed
said
sir
robert
peel
she
is
as
modest
as
a
child
but
she
is
firm
and
and
she
understands
her
position
perfectly
greville
the
clerk
of
the
council
said
william
iv
came
to
the
throne
at
and
he
was
so
excited
that
he
nearly
went
mad
the
young
queen
is
neither
dazzled
nor
confounded
but
she
behaves
with
all
the
sedateness
and
dignity
the
want
of
which
was
so
conspicuous
in
her
uncle
the
duke
of
wellington
was
never
weary
of
praising
her
behavior
lord
melbourne
was
far
more
nervous
than
she
said
the
duke
he
did
not
dare
to
take
his
eyes
off
her
for
fear
she
might
say
or
do
the
wrong
thing
he
need
not
have
been
afraid
she
is
born
to
rule
and
if
she
had
been
ten
years
younger
she
would
have
done
it
equally
well
such
a
bit
of
a
girl
as
she
is
he
added
and
he
finished
by
saying
emphatically
if
she
had
been
my
own
daughter
i
could
not
have
wished
that
she
should
do
better
and
the
good
baroness
lehzen
said
with
tears
in
her
honest
blue
eyes
i
knew
it
i
knew
my
princess
there
were
yet
cabinet
ministers
for
the
queen
to
meet
there
were
matters
little
and
matters
great
to
think
of
and
the
next
morning
there
was
to
be
another
council
meeting
and
the
observance
of
the
ancient
custom
of
proclaiming
a
new
sovereign
to
the
public
but
the
young
girl
found
time
in
this
first
day
of
her
dominion
to
write
a
letter
of
sympathy
to
her
aunt
adelaide
she
addressed
it
as
usual
to
her
majesty
the
queen
when
she
was
reminded
that
the
widow
of
king
william
was
no
longer
queen
but
queen
dowager
she
replied
i
know
that
her
position
is
altered
but
i
will
not
be
the
first
to
remind
her
of
the
change
chapter
v
the
coronation
when
the
young
queen
awoke
on
the
morning
after
her
accession
she
must
have
fancied
for
a
moment
that
she
had
dreamed
all
the
events
of
the
previous
day
she
had
gone
to
bed
expecting
a
quiet
morning
of
study
she
had
been
aroused
to
hear
that
she
was
a
queen
thus
far
she
had
remained
in
her
own
home
and
had
merely
received
those
who
had
come
to
her
the
prime
minister
the
councilors
and
others
but
when
she
had
been
queen
for
a
little
more
than
hours
the
time
had
come
for
her
to
go
to
london
and
be
proclaimed
sovereign
of
england
in
the
presence
of
thousands
of
her
subjects
victoria
and
her
mother
came
out
of
the
palace
followed
by
lord
melbourne
both
ladies
were
in
mourning
the
young
queen
wore
a
black
dress
with
white
at
the
neck
and
wrists
her
bonnet
was
black
and
in
comparison
with
the
great
pink
one
that
had
so
delighted
her
subjects
it
was
very
small
in
front
of
the
royal
carriage
were
the
life
guards
a
magnificent
body
of
men
everyone
drawing
himself
up
to
his
full
height
in
his
pride
that
it
was
company
that
was
to
escort
the
queen
on
her
first
appearance
she
bowed
to
them
first
then
to
the
crowds
that
thronged
about
the
entrance
she
and
her
mother
entered
the
carriage
more
of
the
life
guards
followed
and
a
long
line
of
carriages
filled
with
lords
and
ladies
the
carriages
did
not
go
rapidly
for
every
road
and
lane
and
passage
way
was
full
of
people
who
cheered
and
waved
banners
and
shouted
god
save
the
queen
when
they
arrived
at
james
the
officers
of
state
stood
waiting
to
receive
them
and
they
were
escorted
to
a
window
overlooking
the
quadrangle
below
which
had
long
been
filled
with
a
great
crowd
of
enthusiastic
people
make
way
for
his
grace
the
garter
cried
the
heralds
and
that
officer
advanced
escorted
by
the
gave
one
look
over
the
assembled
people
then
waved
his
scepter
for
silence
and
read
the
formal
proclamation
of
victoria
as
queen
of
great
britain
and
ireland
he
was
glittering
in
all
the
insignia
of
his
office
but
the
eyes
of
the
people
were
not
on
him
they
were
turned
toward
an
upper
window
where
against
a
background
of
crimson
curtains
stood
the
slender
figure
of
the
queen
accompanied
by
her
mother
and
the
prime
minister
the
last
words
of
the
proclamation
were
god
save
the
queen
and
god
save
the
queen
repeated
the
bands
in
a
great
outburst
of
martial
music
the
trumpets
sounded
the
cannon
in
the
park
roared
and
the
cannon
in
the
tower
roared
in
response
the
people
in
the
court
cheered
and
the
people
outside
the
court
cheered
they
waved
their
handkerchiefs
hats
canes
umbrellas
anything
that
they
could
wave
they
could
not
be
induced
to
leave
the
place
and
thousands
hung
about
the
entrance
to
the
palace
for
hours
hoping
for
just
one
glimpse
of
their
sovereign
not
long
after
this
proclamation
the
queen
presided
over
another
council
meeting
and
did
it
so
said
one
who
was
present
as
if
she
had
done
nothing
else
all
her
life
this
was
not
the
end
of
the
day
by
any
means
for
now
the
reception
of
archbishops
bishops
and
judges
followed
she
met
them
with
the
most
perfect
dignity
but
she
was
a
merry
young
girl
as
well
as
a
queen
and
after
she
had
received
the
bishops
and
had
withdrawn
from
the
room
with
a
most
stately
demeanor
they
were
greatly
amused
to
see
her
running
down
the
corridor
like
a
child
just
let
out
of
school
her
majesty
had
forgotten
that
the
door
was
made
of
glass
while
all
this
rejoicing
was
going
on
the
dead
king
lay
in
state
at
windsor
palace
shrouded
in
a
crimson
pall
and
under
a
purple
canopy
the
crowns
of
england
and
of
hanover
lay
above
him
there
were
banners
and
imperial
escutcheons
around
him
were
nobles
admirals
and
guardsmen
nearest
stood
the
feeble
old
duke
of
sussex
in
his
scarlet
uniform
the
dead
march
sounded
and
the
long
line
moved
slowly
on
and
down
to
george
chapel
the
last
honors
were
duly
paid
to
the
dead
king
but
the
thoughts
of
all
the
land
were
with
the
young
queen
before
the
day
had
closed
victoria
and
her
mother
were
escorted
back
to
kensington
by
the
life
guards
to
spend
a
short
time
before
the
queen
should
take
up
her
abode
in
buckingham
palace
i
do
not
want
to
go
there
she
said
to
the
duke
of
sussex
i
love
the
old
kensington
gardens
where
i
can
wander
about
as
i
please
buckingham
palace
is
far
too
big
and
too
grand
for
me
other
people
may
choose
their
homes
but
sovereigns
are
less
free
and
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
leave
the
homelike
kensington
where
her
greatest
troubles
had
been
an
occasional
hard
lesson
and
go
to
buckingham
or
the
new
palace
as
it
was
called
which
was
to
be
her
london
residence
the
new
palace
was
not
yet
completed
but
men
had
been
working
night
and
day
to
prepare
it
for
the
queen
it
stood
on
a
desolate
there
were
dirty
alleys
and
and
dingy
little
hovels
around
it
but
the
coming
of
the
queen
was
to
make
it
gorgeous
a
splendid
new
throne
all
dazzling
in
its
crimson
and
gold
was
built
for
her
is
it
as
your
majesty
would
have
it
inquired
the
builder
it
the
most
comfortable
throne
i
ever
sat
on
replied
the
merry
young
sovereign
buckingham
was
not
lonely
by
any
means
from
over
the
whole
country
came
delegations
from
universities
corporations
and
all
kinds
of
societies
one
of
these
delegations
was
composed
of
quakers
who
believe
that
to
uncover
the
head
is
to
show
to
man
a
reverence
that
should
be
shown
to
god
alone
and
they
marched
up
the
stairway
without
removing
their
gray
hats
this
could
not
be
allowed
but
the
delegates
could
hardly
be
forbidden
to
see
their
queen
someone
was
enough
to
discover
a
way
out
of
the
dilemma
the
quakers
wo
take
off
their
hats
he
whispered
but
it
is
against
their
principles
to
resist
violence
and
they
wo
object
if
we
do
it
for
them
two
of
the
attendants
then
respectfully
raised
each
man
hat
as
he
passed
between
them
and
returned
it
to
his
head
when
the
audience
had
come
to
an
end
at
the
death
of
a
sovereign
parliament
is
always
dissolved
and
a
new
election
is
held
victoria
had
stood
by
her
aunt
adelaide
side
and
seen
the
grand
procession
which
marked
the
prorogation
but
now
the
time
had
come
for
her
to
take
the
principal
place
in
the
procession
it
would
be
better
to
remain
away
and
allow
your
speech
to
be
read
for
you
said
both
her
mother
and
her
physician
remember
how
much
you
have
been
through
within
the
past
month
and
avoid
this
unnecessary
excitement
the
little
queen
was
wiser
than
her
watchful
advisers
she
knew
well
that
her
subjects
had
thronged
every
road
leading
to
buckingham
because
they
wanted
to
see
her
and
she
meant
to
gratify
them
and
appear
in
all
the
splendor
that
a
prorogation
demanded
as
to
being
exhausted
by
these
ceremonials
she
laughed
at
the
idea
of
such
a
thing
i
like
it
all
she
said
i
have
lived
so
quietly
that
it
is
new
to
me
it
tiresome
it
is
amusing
therefore
victoria
regina
was
written
in
letters
of
gold
about
a
beautiful
new
throne
in
the
house
of
lords
davys
her
good
kind
master
as
she
called
him
heard
her
practice
her
speech
then
she
was
made
ready
for
the
ceremony
there
were
no
more
simple
white
muslin
dresses
for
her
she
wore
a
kirtle
of
white
satin
and
over
it
a
crimson
velvet
robe
with
border
of
ermine
the
kirtle
flashed
with
gold
embroidery
and
the
velvet
robe
was
confined
by
a
heavy
golden
cord
and
tassels
diamonds
glittered
and
sparkled
in
her
bracelets
and
coronet
and
on
her
stomacher
a
few
years
before
the
young
girl
had
walked
to
the
milliner
and
home
again
carrying
her
new
bonnet
in
her
hand
but
now
she
seated
herself
in
the
royal
carriage
and
was
drawn
by
eight
horses
the
yeomen
of
the
guard
rode
before
her
and
so
she
went
to
the
house
of
parliament
the
band
played
god
save
the
queen
as
she
entered
the
house
of
lords
and
was
conducted
to
the
throne
on
which
victoria
regina
was
written
it
was
fortunate
that
she
had
no
farther
to
walk
for
before
she
seated
herself
the
laid
upon
her
shoulders
the
heavy
parliamentary
mantle
of
purple
velvet
the
brilliant
company
of
peers
and
bishops
remained
standing
my
lords
be
seated
said
the
queen
the
usual
forms
of
business
were
followed
but
all
interest
centered
in
the
speech
of
the
sovereign
davys
had
tutored
her
well
and
when
she
had
finished
fanny
kemble
the
greatest
actress
of
the
day
declared
i
never
heard
any
spoken
words
more
musical
in
their
gentle
distinctness
charles
sumner
wrote
i
never
heard
anything
better
read
in
my
life
and
the
queen
kind
old
uncle
the
duke
of
sussex
could
only
wipe
his
eyes
and
murmur
beautiful
it
was
not
long
before
the
court
moved
to
windsor
palace
the
ordinary
routine
of
the
queen
day
was
breakfast
with
her
mother
between
eight
and
nine
followed
by
an
hour
or
two
with
lord
melbourne
attending
to
matters
of
state
then
came
an
audience
with
the
cabinet
ministers
whenever
there
was
business
to
be
transacted
about
two
the
queen
and
some
twenty
or
thirty
of
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
court
took
a
horseback
ride
of
two
hours
or
longer
after
this
came
music
or
amusement
of
some
kind
until
the
dinner
hour
if
there
were
any
children
in
the
palace
the
queen
was
always
ready
to
spend
this
time
with
them
and
their
company
must
have
been
a
great
relief
after
the
formalities
of
the
day
dinner
was
at
about
seven
after
dinner
came
music
games
dancing
and
conversation
this
was
the
order
of
the
day
when
it
was
not
broken
into
but
it
was
almost
always
broken
into
for
there
were
balls
receptions
concerts
banquets
and
the
reception
of
delegations
one
visit
which
was
soon
paid
to
the
court
of
england
gave
the
queen
special
delight
it
was
that
of
her
uncle
king
leopold
and
his
queen
victoria
had
never
played
the
hostess
before
but
there
could
have
been
no
one
else
to
whom
she
would
have
been
so
glad
to
show
honor
and
now
there
was
a
merry
time
indeed
for
the
english
queen
planned
picnics
dinner
parties
sailing
parties
and
all
sorts
of
gayeties
those
who
looked
on
from
the
outside
thought
of
the
queen
as
a
young
girl
enjoying
to
the
full
what
was
almost
her
first
taste
of
gayety
and
pleasure
but
there
was
quite
another
side
to
her
life
more
was
required
of
the
sovereign
of
england
than
to
sit
on
a
throne
and
wear
handsome
dresses
and
jewels
there
was
much
hard
work
for
her
to
do
and
this
merry
little
queen
had
no
thought
of
attempting
to
escape
it
those
morning
hours
with
lord
melbourne
were
hours
when
she
must
give
her
keenest
thought
and
closest
attention
at
an
age
when
many
girls
have
little
more
responsibility
than
to
learn
a
lesson
or
to
choose
a
dress
this
girl
had
to
read
complicated
papers
to
listen
to
arguments
on
difficult
subjects
and
sometimes
to
decide
whether
a
man
proven
guilty
of
crime
should
live
or
die
of
course
she
might
have
made
all
this
much
easier
for
herself
by
simply
writing
her
name
wherever
her
ministers
advised
but
she
would
not
sign
any
paper
without
reading
and
understanding
it
your
majesty
said
lord
melbourne
one
day
there
is
no
need
of
your
examining
this
paper
as
it
is
of
no
special
importance
but
it
is
of
special
importance
to
me
replied
the
queen
whether
i
sign
a
paper
with
which
i
am
not
thoroughly
satisfied
papers
of
all
sorts
were
showered
upon
her
sometimes
after
listening
to
lord
melbourne
advice
she
would
come
to
a
decision
on
the
first
reading
but
often
she
would
say
i
must
think
about
this
before
i
sign
it
never
was
a
sovereign
so
overwhelmed
with
papers
and
her
friends
began
to
suspect
that
some
of
the
officials
who
wished
to
have
matters
go
their
own
way
were
trying
to
disgust
her
with
public
business
hoping
that
after
a
little
while
she
would
become
so
tired
of
it
that
she
would
sign
whatever
was
sent
her
they
did
not
know
that
they
were
dealing
with
a
queen
who
had
had
to
finish
her
haycocks
when
she
was
a
little
girl
even
lord
melbourne
used
to
say
laughingly
rather
manage
ten
kings
than
one
queen
there
could
hardly
have
been
a
better
man
than
lord
melbourne
for
the
difficult
position
of
adviser
to
a
young
woman
who
was
also
a
queen
he
was
three
times
her
age
and
while
his
manner
to
her
was
always
one
of
most
profound
respect
he
showed
an
almost
fatherly
feeling
for
the
fatherless
young
girl
he
was
her
prime
minister
and
was
also
her
trusted
friend
before
she
became
queen
he
had
won
her
confidence
in
a
remarkable
way
by
opposing
her
desires
and
those
of
her
mother
in
one
of
those
constantly
recurring
differences
between
king
and
duchess
he
had
stood
firmly
for
the
king
wishes
because
he
was
the
servant
although
he
knew
that
in
a
few
months
at
most
the
princess
would
be
on
the
throne
victoria
was
wise
enough
to
see
that
the
man
who
would
be
faithful
even
at
the
probability
of
his
own
loss
was
the
man
whom
she
might
safely
trust
and
she
did
trust
him
implicitly
another
member
of
the
queen
household
was
the
honest
baron
stockmar
he
had
been
sent
by
king
leopold
as
soon
as
his
royal
niece
had
attained
her
eighteenth
birthday
to
guard
her
interests
and
advise
her
if
it
should
be
necessary
with
people
in
general
he
was
quiet
and
reserved
at
table
he
ate
nothing
and
talked
less
according
to
the
description
of
one
who
was
at
the
court
but
all
felt
that
the
queen
was
especially
frank
with
him
and
that
he
and
lord
melbourne
were
in
perfect
agreement
one
other
duty
he
had
at
the
english
court
which
was
known
only
to
himself
and
king
leopold
and
that
was
to
prepare
the
way
for
the
marriage
that
the
king
hoped
would
come
about
between
his
niece
and
his
nephew
the
two
young
people
were
really
in
training
for
sovereignty
king
leopold
kept
prince
albert
with
him
for
nearly
a
year
after
victoria
accession
he
saw
to
it
that
the
young
man
should
acquire
a
good
knowledge
of
english
and
of
the
english
constitution
baron
stockmar
was
in
the
meantime
teaching
the
queen
the
rightful
position
of
the
sovereign
of
england
the
sovereign
must
belong
to
no
party
he
said
whatever
party
is
in
power
has
been
put
in
power
by
the
nation
and
has
a
right
to
claim
the
loyalty
of
the
queen
of
course
the
devoted
baroness
lehzen
had
followed
her
beloved
pupil
for
one
of
the
first
acts
of
the
queen
was
to
appoint
her
private
secretary
the
baroness
said
i
copy
all
her
private
correspondence
just
as
i
used
to
do
when
she
was
my
princess
and
she
is
as
frank
with
me
as
when
she
was
a
child
but
she
has
never
shown
me
a
state
document
or
said
a
word
to
me
about
any
state
business
she
knows
that
such
matters
should
go
to
her
advisers
and
not
to
me
or
any
other
woman
surely
the
little
queen
was
not
without
good
friends
there
were
king
leopold
the
wisest
sovereign
in
europe
baron
stockmar
the
only
honest
man
lord
melbourne
who
seemed
to
have
no
thought
but
for
her
and
baroness
lehzen
who
had
loved
her
from
her
babyhood
the
position
of
her
mother
was
very
peculiar
and
not
agreeable
in
all
respects
for
eighteen
years
her
only
aim
in
life
had
been
to
prepare
her
daughter
for
the
throne
of
england
the
daughter
was
now
on
the
throne
and
the
duchess
felt
that
her
occupation
was
gone
she
realized
that
matters
of
state
must
be
discussed
with
the
councilors
only
and
for
this
she
was
prepared
but
it
was
not
a
pleasant
surprise
to
find
that
the
young
girl
who
less
than
a
year
before
her
accession
had
meekly
left
the
ballroom
for
bed
at
her
mother
bidding
was
now
manifesting
very
decided
opinions
of
her
own
the
duchess
had
the
fullest
confidence
in
one
of
the
executors
of
her
husband
will
and
she
would
have
been
glad
that
he
should
hold
some
office
in
the
new
government
the
queen
treated
her
mother
with
the
most
tender
affection
and
she
willingly
granted
the
gentleman
a
generous
pension
but
she
refused
to
have
anything
to
do
with
him
victoria
had
ascended
the
throne
but
she
had
never
yet
worn
the
english
crown
for
though
a
young
girl
may
become
a
queen
in
a
moment
a
coronation
is
a
different
matter
the
king
is
dead
and
therefore
victoria
is
queen
declared
the
council
and
she
was
queen
but
the
preparations
for
a
coronation
require
more
time
than
does
the
writing
of
an
address
of
loyalty
and
it
was
a
whole
year
before
these
preparations
were
completed
it
was
not
an
easy
task
to
decide
just
what
ceremonies
should
be
observed
one
matter
to
be
seriously
deliberated
upon
was
whether
the
left
cheek
of
the
young
girl
should
be
forced
to
endure
six
hundred
kisses
of
state
from
the
six
hundred
nobles
and
bishops
there
was
not
even
a
crown
suited
to
the
occasion
for
the
old
one
weighed
seven
pounds
and
the
most
devoted
admirers
of
the
ancient
usages
could
not
ask
that
the
little
queen
should
carry
that
load
on
her
head
after
many
lengthy
consultations
these
momentous
questions
were
decided
the
tradesmen
were
assured
that
there
would
be
enough
ceremony
to
bring
about
large
sales
the
peers
and
bishops
were
told
that
they
would
not
be
allowed
to
kiss
the
pink
cheek
of
the
queen
and
the
crown
jewelers
were
bidden
to
set
to
work
on
a
new
crown
that
should
weigh
only
half
as
much
as
the
old
one
the
day
came
at
last
june
london
evidently
meant
to
make
the
most
of
it
and
as
soon
as
the
eager
watchers
saw
the
first
glimpse
of
dawn
a
salute
of
cannon
was
fired
it
was
only
a
little
after
three
but
the
earliness
of
the
hour
made
little
difference
to
the
thousands
that
had
been
up
all
night
some
had
stayed
up
to
be
sure
of
securing
a
good
place
to
see
the
procession
some
because
the
services
of
the
hairdressers
were
in
such
demand
that
when
a
head
was
once
in
order
no
risk
of
disarrangement
could
be
ventured
upon
and
some
had
been
kept
awake
by
pure
excitement
and
nervousness
there
was
no
sleeping
after
daylight
for
anyone
for
those
who
were
far
enough
from
the
tower
to
drowse
through
the
firing
of
cannon
were
aroused
by
the
ringing
of
bells
which
followed
as
every
church
tower
rang
out
its
merriest
chimes
at
five
westminster
abbey
was
opened
and
this
was
none
too
early
for
the
people
who
were
fortunate
enough
and
rich
enough
to
obtain
tickets
had
long
been
thronging
the
entrance
these
people
in
the
abbey
had
a
long
time
to
wait
for
it
was
fully
ten
before
the
salute
of
guns
from
the
park
gave
the
signal
that
the
procession
had
started
from
buckingham
palace
such
a
procession
as
it
was
first
came
the
trumpeters
then
the
life
guards
bands
foreign
ambassadors
in
most
gorgeous
carriages
more
life
guards
the
carriage
of
the
duchess
of
kent
the
duke
of
sussex
and
others
of
the
royal
family
the
officers
of
the
royal
household
and
the
yeomen
of
the
guard
then
all
the
thousands
along
the
way
were
agape
for
the
eight
horses
were
seen
drawing
the
chariot
of
state
wherein
sat
the
pretty
little
maiden
who
was
the
center
and
cause
of
all
this
magnificence
a
circlet
of
diamonds
was
on
her
head
she
wore
a
dress
of
gold
tissue
and
a
mantle
of
crimson
velvet
trimmed
with
gold
lace
and
lined
with
ermine
pearls
and
diamonds
gleamed
and
flashed
at
every
motion
with
her
rode
the
mistress
of
the
robes
and
the
master
of
the
horse
a
body
of
cavalry
followed
her
the
procession
was
nearly
an
hour
and
a
half
in
reaching
the
abbey
for
the
queen
would
not
go
by
the
shortest
way
all
that
time
people
were
shouting
and
banners
were
waving
for
every
house
along
the
line
of
march
was
brilliant
with
as
much
decoration
as
its
owner
could
afford
half
a
million
strangers
were
in
london
and
many
houses
were
rented
at
enormous
rates
five
or
six
thousand
dollars
was
not
looked
upon
as
a
rental
at
all
exorbitant
and
some
were
let
at
a
much
higher
price
at
the
door
of
the
abbey
the
queen
was
met
by
the
chief
officers
of
state
she
walked
slowly
up
the
aisle
but
not
alone
by
any
means
heralds
clergy
and
officers
of
state
came
first
then
a
noble
bearing
the
coronet
of
the
duchess
of
cambridge
followed
by
the
duchess
herself
with
her
long
train
of
purple
velvet
another
coronet
was
borne
on
a
silken
cushion
and
after
it
came
the
duchess
of
kent
then
came
six
nobles
each
carrying
some
piece
of
the
regalia
there
were
dukes
and
earls
and
marquises
and
generals
and
field
marshals
and
bishops
all
in
their
most
brilliant
array
a
little
whisper
the
queen
the
queen
ran
through
the
long
lines
of
peers
and
peeresses
and
ambassadors
and
judges
it
was
followed
by
the
waving
of
handkerchiefs
and
scarfs
and
such
shouts
of
applause
as
shook
the
abbey
to
its
foundations
and
victoria
advanced
escorted
by
three
bishops
eight
young
girls
in
white
silk
and
silver
with
blush
roses
carried
her
train
then
came
members
of
the
royal
household
and
other
officials
without
number
all
this
time
the
choir
were
singing
i
was
glad
when
they
said
unto
me
let
us
go
into
the
house
of
the
lord
then
they
sang
god
save
the
queen
and
the
trumpets
sounded
the
accompaniment
a
most
impressive
moment
followed
the
trumpets
ceased
every
voice
was
hushed
not
a
sound
was
heard
among
all
the
thousands
in
the
vast
abbey
the
queen
had
passed
through
the
door
looking
like
a
young
girl
on
her
birthday
but
now
her
face
was
grave
and
she
knelt
before
the
altar
for
a
moment
of
silent
prayer
by
an
ancient
privilege
the
westminster
schoolboys
had
the
right
to
give
the
first
greeting
to
the
sovereign
and
as
she
rose
the
abbey
rang
with
their
shouts
victoria
victoria
vivat
victoria
regina
the
next
part
of
the
ceremony
is
known
as
the
recognition
that
is
the
recognition
of
the
new
sovereign
as
the
lawful
sovereign
the
queen
and
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
turned
to
the
north
and
the
archbishop
said
sirs
i
here
present
unto
you
queen
victoria
the
undoubted
queen
of
this
realm
wherefore
all
you
who
are
come
this
day
to
do
your
homage
are
you
willing
to
do
the
same
god
save
queen
victoria
the
people
cried
the
archbishop
and
the
queen
then
turned
to
the
south
to
the
east
and
to
the
west
and
the
same
words
were
repeated
with
the
same
response
this
signified
that
the
people
of
the
land
had
formally
accepted
her
as
their
sovereign
after
this
the
queen
followed
by
the
eight
walked
to
the
altar
and
she
made
an
offering
of
a
golden
altar
cloth
and
a
pound
weight
of
gold
this
was
only
the
beginning
of
the
ceremony
and
next
came
a
long
sermon
preached
by
the
bishop
of
london
followed
by
the
solemn
oath
of
the
queen
to
be
just
and
govern
according
to
the
law
then
came
the
act
of
coronation
but
for
this
victoria
was
not
to
appear
in
jewels
and
ermine
she
was
escorted
to
one
of
the
chapels
and
robed
in
a
flowing
gown
of
fine
white
muslin
over
this
was
thrown
a
robe
of
gold
brocade
worked
with
the
rose
the
shamrock
and
the
thistle
emblematic
of
england
ireland
and
scotland
in
this
quaint
and
ancient
costume
she
knelt
before
the
altar
the
archbishop
led
her
to
the
famous
old
chair
of
edward
wherein
was
the
stone
of
scone
and
touched
her
head
and
hands
with
the
holy
oil
the
scepter
orb
sword
and
other
things
signifying
power
and
authority
in
either
church
or
state
were
handed
to
her
each
with
a
few
words
from
the
archbishop
exhorting
her
to
use
it
properly
the
ruby
ring
was
placed
upon
her
finger
and
the
mantle
upon
her
shoulders
then
the
archbishop
slowly
lifted
the
crown
which
was
blazing
with
diamonds
sapphires
rubies
and
emeralds
and
placed
it
upon
her
head
the
next
moment
all
the
peers
and
peeresses
lifted
their
coronets
and
put
them
on
the
whole
building
flashed
and
glittered
until
one
might
have
fancied
that
it
was
raining
diamonds
god
save
the
queen
echoed
and
the
thousands
who
stood
outside
the
abbey
caught
up
the
cry
the
bells
of
all
the
churches
in
london
began
to
ring
and
the
guns
of
all
the
garrison
towns
were
fired

and

one
of
the
peers
was
so
aged
and
infirm
that
he
tried
twice
in
vain
to
ascend
the
steps
the
queen
rose
and
moved
toward
him
and
extended
her
hand
to
him
as
simply
and
naturally
as
any
other
young
girl
might
have
done
who
was
not
sitting
on
a
throne
after
the
homage
she
received
the
holy
sacrament
the
hallelujah
chorus
was
sung
and
then
the
procession
and
went

the
way

iii
was
crowned
he
complained
of
some
blunders
that
were
made
but
he
could
hardly
have
been
much
comforted
by
the
reply
that
matters
would
go
better
next
time
even
though
victoria
was
the
third
sovereign
crowned
since
the
time
of
george
there
were
still
some
mistakes
england
was
accustomed
to
crowning
strong
men
but
not
slender
young
girls
and
the
orb
was
made
so
heavy
that
holding
it
was
very
wearisome
while
the
ruby
ring
was
made
for
the
little
finger
and
had
to
be
forced
upon
the
ring
finger
as
best
it
could
be
when
the
peers
did
homage
they
were
required
to
touch
the
crown
and
the
queen
said
it
was
fortunate
that
she
had
had
it
made
as
tight
as
possible
for
many
of
them
knocked
it
and
one
actually
clutched
it
after
such
a
day
as
this
victoria
must
have
felt
that
she
was
really
and
truly
a
queen
but
with
all
her
dignity
and
her
royalty
she
was
still
a
frank
natural
young
girl
and
the
story
is
told
that
when
she
entered
buckingham
palace
and
heard
the
bark
of
her
favorite
dog
she
exclaimed
oh
there
dash
i
must
go
and
give
him
his
bath
the
english
were
proud
of
their
queen
of
her
dignity
and
her
royal
bearing
but
it
was
these
touches
of
frankness
and
simplicity
that
won
their
hearts
and
made
them
feel
that
with
all
her
jewels
her
velvets
and
her
ermine
she
was
after
all
one
of
themselves
it
was
at
this
time
that
the
duke
of
sussex
wrote
to
a
friend
the
girl
queen
is
becoming
more
and
more
popular
you
would
simply
idolize
her
if
you
saw
that
bright
little
face
with
clear
blue
eyes
winning
all
hearts
and
making
us
all
say
save
the
queen
chapter
vi
the
coming
of
the
prince
the
coronation
ceremonies
in
westminster
abbey
were
indeed
magnificent
but
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
england
was
satisfied
with
no
further
celebration
of
so
joyful
an
event
throughout
the
realm
there
were
for
several
days
fairs
balls
and
entertainments
of
all
kinds
london
was
illuminated
and
the
theaters
were
made
free
to
all
who
chose
to
attend
them
people
hearts
and
purses
were
opened
the
rich
were
not
satisfied
with
having
a
good
time
themselves
they
wanted
the
children
of
the
land
and
the
poor
to
have
a
good
time
also
in
many
places
feasts
were
given
and
one
of
the
most
famous
of
these
was
held
in
a
great
open
field
in
cambridge
where
more
than
fourteen
thousand
persons
were
entertained
in
the
center
of
the
field
was
a
space
for
the
band
and
around
it
a
platform
much
money
had
been
subscribed
for
the
feast
but
the
committee
felt
sure
that
large
numbers
of
people
would
be
ready
to
pay
from
cents
to
one
dollar
and
a
half
for
the
privilege
of
walking
about
on
this
platform
and
seeing
what
was
to
be
seen
they
were
right
for
there
was
a
most
fashionable
and
select
company
who
promenaded
around
the
circular
platform
and
watched
the
feasters
sixty
tables
each
two
hundred
and
thirty
feet
long
stretched
out
from
the
central
platform
like
the
rays
of
a
star
and
when
the
signal
was
given
the
fourteen
thousand
persons
poor
people
and
children
of
all
ages
marched
to
their
places
it
must
have
been
an
amusing
procession
for
each
one
was
obliged
to
bring
his
own
plate
knife
fork
and
mug
for
beer
there
was
roast
beef
and
there
were
various
other
good
things
but
the
member
of
the
committee
who
wrote
the
account
of
the
dinner
seems
to
have
been
especially
interested
in
the
puddings
beautiful
puddings
he
says
they
were
and
he
tells
just
where
each
one
was
boiled
he
states
too
that
pounds
of
raisins
were
put
into
them
at
the
end
of
the
dinner
pipes
tobacco
and
snuff
were
passed
to
the
grown
folk
there
was
a
salute
of
nineteen
guns
in
honor
of
the
nineteen
years
a
balloon
which
the
enthusiastic
committeeman
calls
a
stupendous
machine
was
sent
up
and
the
health
of
the
queen
was
drunk
the
children
sang
a
song
of
better
intention
than
rhyme
which
began
victoria
victoria
we
hail
thy
gentle
rule
victoria
the
patroness
of
every
sunday
school
after
the
singing
came
various
games
and
contests
men
tried
to
climb
a
pole
to
get
a
leg
of
mutton
which
was
fastened
to
the
top
others
were
tied
into
sacks
and
jumped
as
far
as
possible
in
the
attempt
to
win
a
pair
of
boots
there
was
a
wheelbarrow
race
run
by
ten
blindfolded
men
a
pig
was
offered
to
the
man
who
could
catch
the
animal
and
swing
it
over
his
shoulder
by
the
tail
men
grinned
through
to
see
who
could
make
the
ugliest
face
and
so
win
a
pair
of
new
trousers
six
boys
with
their
hands
tied
behind
their
backs
were
given
penny
loaves
and
molasses
and
a
new
hat
was
waiting
for
the
one
who
ate
his
loaf
first
other
boys
with
their
hands
tied
were
bobbing
for
apples
that
is
trying
to
lift
apples
with
their
teeth
from
a
tub
of
water
and
another
group
of
boys
were
struggling
to
see
who
could
first
swallow
a
pennyworth
of
dry
biscuit
and
so
win
a
new
waistcoat
there
were
foot
races
and
donkey
races
and
hurdle
races
and
races
among
men
each
with
one
leg
tied
up
at
last
the
day
came
to
an
end
with
fireworks
and
all
the
happy
tired
people
went
home
fully
convinced
that
under
this
new
sovereign
their
country
would
be
more
prosperous
than
ever
it
seems
very
strange
that
this
queen
who
was
worshiped
by
her
people
in
the
summer
of
should
in
the
course
of
a
few
months
have
become
exceedingly
unpopular
with
some
of
her
subjects
but
so
it
was
there
were
in
england
two
political
parties
the
whigs
and
the
tories
queen
victoria
sympathies
were
with
the
whigs
they
were
in
power
when
she
came
to
the
throne
but
in
the
spring
of
the
cabinet
proposed
an
important
bill
which
parliament
refused
to
make
a
law
under
such
circumstances
it
is
the
custom
for
the
prime
minister
and
the
cabinet
to
resign
because
such
a
refusal
is
supposed
to
signify
that
the
people
whom
parliament
represents
do
not
approve
of
their
acts
when
lord
melbourne
told
the
queen
that
he
must
resign
she
felt
very
badly
she
must
stand
at
the
head
of
a
great
nation
and
the
one
in
whose
advice
she
had
trusted
could
advise
her
no
longer
the
leaders
of
the
tories
were
the
duke
as
the
duke
of
wellington
was
called
and
sir
robert
peel
and
lord
melbourne
told
her
that
her
wisest
course
would
be
to
ask
the
duke
to
become
her
prime
minister
and
select
a
cabinet
of
tories
the
duke
had
declared
before
this
that
he
did
not
know
what
the
tories
would
do
for
a
prime
minister
if
they
should
come
into
power
i
have
no
small
talk
he
said
and
peel
has
no
manners
but
when
the
queen
sent
for
him
of
course
he
obeyed
she
asked
him
to
be
her
prime
minister
and
said
to
him
honestly
i
can
not
help
being
very
sorry
to
make
a
change
and
give
up
my
ministers
especially
lord
melbourne
for
he
has
been
almost
a
father
to
me
the
straightforward
old
soldier
was
delighted
with
her
frankness
but
he
said
i
am
somewhat
deaf
and
i
am
too
old
a
man
to
undertake
this
work
and
serve
you
properly
moreover
it
would
be
much
better
for
one
who
can
lead
the
house
of
commons
to
be
your
majesty
prime
minister
i
advise
you
to
send
for
sir
robert
peel
now
this
girl
of
nineteen
did
not
like
the
man
who
had
no
manners
but
she
was
a
lady
as
well
as
a
queen
and
when
sir
robert
appeared
in
full
dress
as
was
required
she
received
him
so
courteously
that
he
went
away
much
pleased
having
promised
to
obey
her
command
and
form
a
cabinet
this
was
easily
done
and
the
next
morning
he
brought
her
a
list
of
names
but
you
must
not
expect
me
to
give
up
the
society
of
lord
melbourne
she
said
certainly
not
was
peel
reply
moreover
lord
melbourne
is
too
honorable
a
man
to
attempt
to
influence
your
majesty
in
any
way
against
the
existing
government
sir
robert
then
suggested
several
men
whom
he
knew
that
she
liked
for
various
positions
of
honor
in
the
royal
household
finally
he
said
perhaps
a
little
bluntly
it
will
be
desirable
to
make
some
changes
in
the
ladies
of
your
household
then
a
storm
arose
i
shall
not
part
with
any
of
my
ladies
declared
the
queen
but
your
majesty
said
sir
robert
most
of
these
ladies
are
closely
related
to
the
former
cabinet
ministers
the
queen
would
not
yield
but
she
was
willing
to
discuss
the
subject
later
with
him
and
the
duke
when
they
appeared
before
her
they
said
your
majesty
the
ladies
of
the
household
are
on
the
same
footing
as
the
lords
no
declared
the
queen
i
have
lords
besides
and
i
have
let
you
do
with
them
as
you
chose
if
you
had
just
been
put
out
of
office
and
lord
melbourne
had
come
in
i
am
sure
that
he
would
not
have
asked
me
to
give
up
my
ladies
there
are
more
whigs
than
tories
in
the
house
of
commons
said
peel
and
if
these
ladies
who
are
closely
related
to
prominent
whigs
are
retained
all
europe
will
look
upon
england
as
the
country
that
is
governed
by
a
party
which
the
sovereign
dislikes
and
in
which
she
has
no
confidence
i
give
you
my
lords
replied
the
queen
steadfastly
but
i
keep
my
ladies
the
two
nobles
were
in
a
dilemma
according
to
the
british
constitution
the
queen
can
do
no
wrong
that
is
not
she
but
the
prime
minister
is
held
responsible
for
every
public
act
sir
robert
could
not
remain
prime
minister
if
the
queen
positively
refused
to
yield
to
a
course
which
he
thought
necessary
while
the
tory
leaders
were
trying
to
plan
some
way
out
of
the
difficulty
the
queen
sent
a
letter
to
lord
melbourne
which
was
written
in
much
the
same
way
that
an
indignant
young
girl
would
write
to
her
father
do
not
fear
she
said
that
i
was
not
calm
and
composed
they
wanted
to
deprive
me
of
my
ladies
and
i
suppose
they
would
deprive
me
next
of
my
dressers
and
housemaids
they
wished
to
treat
me
like
a
girl
but
i
will
show
them
that
i
am
queen
of
england
lord
melbourne
called
his
cabinet
together
in
such
haste
that
one
member
had
to
be
brought
from
the
opera
and
another
from
a
dinner
party
he
read
them
the
queen
letter
and
asked
what
shall
we
advise
advise
her
to
give
up
two
or
three
of
her
principal
ladies
suggested
one
and
perhaps
that
will
satisfy
peel
does
anyone
know
exactly
what
peel
wants
queried
another
and
how
many
ladies
he
demands
shall
be
removed
this
was
an
exceedingly
sensible
question
and
if
it
had
been
taken
to
peel
for
an
answer
the
trouble
might
have
been
brought
to
an
end
he
would
probably
have
been
satisfied
with
the
resignation
of
two
or
three
of
the
strongest
partisans
and
principal
talkers
among
the
ladies
and
although
the
queen
was
insisting
upon
what
she
believed
was
her
right
yet
much
of
her
indignation
arose
from
her
belief
that
peel
meant
to
deprive
her
of
all
who
were
then
her
attendants
perhaps
even
the
baroness
lehzen
the
question
was
not
taken
to
peel
however
and
the
discussion
in
the
cabinet
went
on
let
us
write
a
letter
for
the
queen
to
copy
and
send
to
peel
was
the
next
suggestion
saying
that
she
will
not
consent
to
a
course
which
she
believes
to
be
contrary
to
custom
and
which
is
repugnant
to
her
feelings
this
suggestion
was
adopted
the
letter
was
written
and
the
queen
copied
it
to
send
but
before
it
reached
sir
robert
he
resigned
his
position
and
lord
melbourne
was
again
prime
minister
this
was
the
famous
bedchamber
plot
and
it
aroused
all
england
lord
melbourne
and
the
whigs
said
it
is
a
small
matter
that
the
queen
should
be
allowed
to
retain
her
favorite
attendants
sir
robert
and
the
tories
replied
the
prime
minister
is
responsible
for
the
acts
of
the
queen
and
it
is
a
large
matter
if
she
refuses
to
follow
his
advice
when
he
believes
that
the
good
of
the
realm
demands
a
certain
course
she
is
not
the
queen
of
the
whole
country
she
is
only
the
queen
of
the
whigs
and
the
whole
thing
is
a
plot
to
keep
the
whigs
in
power
are
loyal
to
our
sovereign
declared
the
whigs
stand
by
the
constitution
of
great
britain
not
by
the
whims
of
a
girl
of
nineteen
retorted
the
tories
the
amusing
part
of
the
struggle
was
that
the
whigs
had
always
prided
themselves
on
standing
by
the
constitution
and
the
rights
of
the
people
while
the
tories
had
favored
increasing
the
power
of
the
sovereign
but
in
those
days
the
question
was
too
serious
to
strike
anyone
as
amusing
as
the
weeks
of
the
summer
and
the
early
autumn
passed
matters
only
grew
worse
victoria
was
spoken
of
most
contemptuously
and
was
even
hissed
in
a
public
assembly
greville
wrote
in
his
journal
the
tories
seem
not
to
care
one
straw
for
the
crown
its
dignity
or
its
authority
because
the
head
on
which
it
is
placed
does
not
nod
with
benignity
to
them
peel
was
of
course
above
such
behavior
as
that
of
some
of
his
violent
partisans
but
he
must
have
been
somewhat
surprised
at
developments
he
had
been
afraid
that
the
queen
opinions
and
judgment
were
so
weak
that
she
would
be
influenced
by
the
talk
of
a
few
ladies
in
attendance
and
would
be
unable
to
judge
questions
fairly
and
without
prejudice
but
he
had
found
that
whatever
might
be
the
faults
of
the
young
lady
on
the
throne
she
could
never
be
accused
of
having
no
will
of
her
own
during
the
first
two
years
of
her
reign
the
friends
of
the
queen
were
watching
her
with
much
anxiety
she
was
an
unusual
girl
with
an
unusual
training
but
after
all
she
was
only
a
girl
and
she
had
responsibilities
to
meet
from
which
as
carlyle
said
an
archangel
might
have
shrunk
her
position
was
all
the
more
dangerous
because
she
was
too
young
to
realize
her
difficulties
and
when
trouble
arose
there
was
no
one
in
the
land
of
whom
she
could
ask
counsel
without
arousing
the
enmity
of
someone
else
everyone
who
was
capable
of
advising
her
was
prominent
in
one
political
party
or
the
other
if
she
had
discussed
any
of
her
hard
questions
with
even
her
own
mother
and
it
had
become
evident
that
suggestions
had
come
from
the
duchess
of
kent
there
would
have
been
talk
at
once
of
foreign
influence
meanwhile
foreign
influence
in
the
person
of
the
wise
king
leopold
was
busily
at
work
the
young
queen
had
reigned
for
more
than
two
years
and
the
first
novelty
of
her
position
had
passed
at
first
it
had
been
delightful
to
her
to
feel
that
she
was
the
queen
and
that
she
could
do
precisely
as
she
chose
even
the
bedchamber
plot
had
resulted
in
her
having
her
own
way
in
keeping
her
ladies
and
the
whig
cabinet
but
so
a
woman
as
queen
victoria
must
have
seen
as
indeed
she
declared
some
years
later
that
she
had
not
behaved
like
a
constitutional
monarch
and
she
knew
that
thousands
of
her
subjects
were
indignant
with
her
never
was
a
loving
uncle
more
shrewd
in
his
affection
than
this
wisest
sovereign
in
europe
for
just
at
this
time
when
his
niece
was
feeling
far
less
than
she
had
felt
some
months
earlier
he
proposed
that
prince
albert
and
his
brother
ernest
should
pay
her
a
visit
the
young
men
came
bringing
with
them
a
letter
from
the
king
which
spoke
of
them
in
most
terms
as
good
honest
creatures
really
sensible
and
trustworthy
the
point
of
the
letter
was
in
its
closing
sentence
i
am
sure
that
if
you
have
anything
to
recommend
to
them
they
will
be
most
happy
to
hear
it
from
you
the
queen
knew
very
well
what
this
sentence
signified
and
she
was
more
ready
to
recommend
than
she
would
have
been
some
months
before
she
had
seen
her
cousins
only
once
and
that
was
more
than
three
years
earlier
prince
albert
was
then
a
lovable
boy
and
the
princess
was
willing
that
her
relatives
should
understand
that
she
would
marry
him
some
day
when
nearly
two
years
had
passed
and
she
had
become
queen
she
felt
much
older
and
more
mature
but
she
thought
of
her
cousin
as
still
a
boy
she
expected
to
marry
him
some
time
in
the
future
but
she
was
not
willing
to
permit
even
any
formal
engagement
at
that
time
king
leopold
wrote
urging
her
to
make
some
decisive
arrangement
for
the
following
year
the
queen
replied
albert
and
i
are
both
too
young
to
think
of
marriage
at
present
he
does
not
know
english
well
enough
and
there
are
other
studies
which
he
needs
to
pursue
king
leopold
saw
that
it
was
of
no
use
to
press
the
question
further
at
that
time
and
he
told
the
prince
that
the
marriage
would
have
to
be
postponed
for
a
few
years
the
prince
saw
the
truth
in
objections
he
knew
that
his
position
in
england
would
demand
all
the
skill
and
knowledge
that
he
could
acquire
and
he
admitted
that
her
arguments
were
strong
you
understand
and
you
will
wait
asked
his
uncle
yes
answered
the
prince
i
will
wait
if
i
have
only
some
certain
assurance
to
go
on
but
i
do
not
want
to
be
left
in
the
ridiculous
position
of
queen
elizabeth
suitors
i
do
not
want
all
europe
talking
for
years
about
my
marriage
and
then
laughing
at
the
announcement
that
victoria
never
meant
to
marry
me
another
year
passed
then
came
the
bedchamber
trouble
king
leopold
watched
every
item
of
news
from
england
now
is
the
time
said
the
sagacious
king
to
himself
and
he
proposed
the
visit
there
had
been
little
correspondence
between
the
cousins
prince
albert
had
sent
the
princess
sketches
of
the
places
that
he
had
visited
in
his
travels
and
when
she
became
queen
he
wrote
her
a
somewhat
formal
little
letter
reminding
her
that
the
happiness
of
millions
lay
in
her
hands
and
closing
rather
primly
i
will
not
be
indiscreet
and
abuse
your
time
victoria
must
have
had
in
her
mind
a
picture
of
her
cousin
that
was
a
strange
combination
of
a
serious
young
man
somewhat
given
to
sermonizing
and
the
stout
merry
boy
of
seventeen
who
had
slipped
down
to
the
floor
of
his
carriage
and
pushed
his
dog
head
up
to
the
window
when
people
pressed
around
to
see
the
prince
with
these
two
conflicting
notions
in
her
thoughts
the
queen
went
to
the
head
of
the
staircase
in
windsor
palace
to
welcome
her
two
dear
cousins
the
stout
boy
had
vanished
but
in
his
place
stood
a
tall
manly
handsome
young
man
with
a
cheery
thoughtful
face
two
days
later
a
letter
went
from
the
queen
to
uncle
leopold
which
said
my
dear
uncle
albert
is
fascinating
then
she
remembered
that
she
had
two
cousinly
guests
and
added
the
young
men
are
very
amiable
delightful
companions
and
i
am
very
glad
to
have
them
here
king
leopold
wrote
at
once
i
am
sure
you
will
like
the
cousins
the
more
the
longer
you
see
them
then
he
talked
about
the
prince
albert
is
full
of
talent
and
fun
and
draws
cleverly
may
he
be
able
to
strew
roses
without
thorns
on
the
pathway
of
life
of
our
good
victoria
he
is
well
qualified
to
do
so
while
the
hopeful
uncle
was
writing
this
letter
victoria
was
talking
with
lord
melbourne
my
lord
she
said
i
have
made
up
my
mind
at
last
and
i
am
ready
to
marry
prince
albert
whenever
he
wants
me
i
am
very
glad
of
it
replied
her
fatherly
friend
you
will
be
much
more
comfortable
for
a
woman
can
not
stand
alone
for
any
time
in
whatever
position
she
may
be
do
you
think
that
my
people
will
be
pleased
she
asked
i
believe
that
they
will
he
replied
for
he
knew
very
well
how
eager
they
were
for
her
marriage
no
one
liked
the
duke
of
cumberland
who
was
now
king
ernest
of
hanover
but
if
the
queen
died
without
children
he
would
come
over
to
england
and
wear
the
english
crown
as
well
as
that
of
hanover
the
feeling
against
him
was
so
strong
that
it
had
even
been
proposed
in
parliament
to
make
a
law
forbidding
him
ever
to
occupy
the
throne
on
the
fourth
morning
of
their
visit
the
two
princes
went
hunting
it
was
a
long
forenoon
to
the
queen
for
she
had
what
she
afterwards
called
a
nervous
thing
to
do
they
came
back
at
noon
but
they
had
hardly
time
to
change
their
hunting
clothes
before
a
message
was
brought
to
prince
albert
that
the
queen
wished
to
see
him
now
royal
etiquette
forbade
that
this
prince
of
a
little
german
duchy
should
ask
the
sovereign
of
great
britain
for
her
hand
so
when
albert
reached
the
queen
apartments
he
was
obliged
to
wait
until
she
had
spoken
i
think
you
must
know
why
i
wished
you
to
come
she
said
shyly
the
prince
had
still
to
keep
silent
he
could
only
bow
but
his
bow
must
have
expressed
a
great
deal
for
she
went
on
bravely
it
will
make
me
very
happy
if
you
will
consent
to
what
i
wish
in
just
what
form
the
prince
made
his
reply
the
queen
did
not
reveal
but
it
was
evidently
satisfactory
for
she
wrote
he
is
perfection
in
every
way
that
very
day
she
sent
a
letter
to
king
leopold
in
which
she
said
i
am
so
much
bewildered
by
it
all
that
i
hardly
know
how
to
write
but
i
do
feel
very
happy
a
few
weeks
before
this
time
she
had
written
baron
stockmar
that
she
could
not
think
of
marrying
for
three
or
four
years
but
that
very
day
she
wrote
him
i
feel
so
guilty
i
know
not
how
to
begin
my
letter
but
i
think
the
news
it
will
contain
will
be
sufficient
to
insure
your
forgiveness
albert
has
completely
won
my
heart
and
all
was
settled
between
us
this
morning
i
feel
certain
that
he
will
make
me
very
happy
i
wish
i
could
say
continued
the
modest
little
sovereign
of
great
britain
that
i
felt
as
certain
of
making
him
happy
but
i
shall
do
my
best
prince
albert
too
had
some
letters
to
write
and
as
victoria
had
written
to
king
leopold
his
first
was
to
baron
stockmar
after
telling
of
his
happiness
and
of
his
love
for
the
queen
he
wrote
i
can
not
write
more
i
am
too
much
bewildered
it
certainly
was
bewildering
he
had
been
told
not
long
before
that
the
queen
was
determined
not
to
marry
for
three
or
four
years
at
any
rate
and
that
she
would
not
consent
to
any
formal
engagement
he
had
come
to
england
with
a
determination
to
insist
either
that
she
should
recognize
the
informal
engagement
between
them
or
that
it
should
be
broken
off
the
duchess
of
kent
had
loved
albert
from
the
first
and
she
was
very
happy
in
the
thought
of
the
marriage
she
and
the
baroness
lehzen
together
with
lord
melbourne
and
prince
albert
brother
were
the
only
ones
in
england
who
knew
the
secret
until
five
or
six
weeks
had
passed
then
came
a
difficult
five
minutes
for
the
young
queen
she
had
to
meet
her
council
of
eighty
men
and
tell
them
of
her
engagement
it
is
no
wonder
that
she
hardly
knew
who
was
there
the
picture
of
the
prince
in
her
bracelet
gave
her
courage
and
though
lord
melbourne
was
far
down
the
room
she
caught
a
kind
look
from
him
and
saw
the
tears
of
sympathy
in
his
eyes
her
fingers
trembled
but
she
soon
controlled
herself
and
read
it
is
my
intention
to
ally
myself
in
marriage
with
the
prince
albert
of
and
gotha
she
went
through
the
rest
of
the
paper
with
her
usual
clear
sweet
voice
and
one
of
the
councilors
wrote
of
the
event
certainly
she
did
look
as
interesting
and
as
handsome
as
any
young
lady
i
ever
saw
when
the
reading
of
the
paper
was
finished
the
lord
president
asked
have
we
your
majesty
permission
to
publish
this
declaration
the
queen
bowed
and
left
the
council
chamber
about
two
months
later
she
had
something
even
harder
to
do
she
had
to
open
parliament
and
ask
that
an
income
should
be
granted
to
the
prince
another
matter
also
had
to
be
settled
and
that
was
what
position
he
should
hold
in
england
whether
he
should
enter
a
room
before
or
after
dukes
earls
and
members
of
the
royal
family
was
a
question
that
gave
rise
to
much
discussion
these
two
questions
were
not
settled
as
the
queen
wished
for
the
sum
granted
to
the
prince
was
but
of
what
her
ministers
had
asked
and
parliament
refused
to
pass
a
law
giving
him
precedence
next
to
herself
the
duke
of
wellington
said
let
the
queen
put
the
prince
just
where
she
wishes
him
to
be
and
this
she
did
as
far
as
england
was
concerned
by
issuing
an
order
in
council
that
he
should
stand
next
to
herself
some
of
her
royal
relatives
were
indignant
and
king
ernest
declared
positively
that
he
would
never
give
precedence
to
the
younger
brother
of
a
german
duke
i
wo
give
way
to
any
paper
royal
highness
he
declared
the
queen
was
both
hurt
and
angry
at
these
decisions
but
prince
albert
only
fear
was
lest
they
indicated
objection
to
the
marriage
on
the
part
of
the
english
and
he
wrote
while
i
possess
your
love
they
can
not
make
me
unhappy
a
little
more
than
a
week
after
this
letter
was
written
the
day
of
the
wedding
came
it
had
been
the
custom
to
celebrate
royal
weddings
in
the
evening
though
other
weddings
must
by
law
take
place
before
noon
but
on
this
as
on
most
other
subjects
the
queen
had
a
very
definite
opinion
i
wish
to
be
married
as
my
subjects
are
married
she
said
and
the
ceremony
must
be
at
noon
is
it
the
will
of
your
majesty
that
the
word
be
omitted
from
the
promise
that
you
make
to
the
prince
asked
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
no
she
answered
with
decision
i
am
not
to
be
married
as
a
queen
but
as
a
woman
the
wedding
day
was
stormy
but
that
made
little
difference
to
bride
groom
or
any
of
the
brilliant
company
assembled
in
the
chapel
of
james
the
prince
wore
the
uniform
of
a
british
with
the
collar
of
the
garter
and
looked
exceedingly
handsome
as
he
came
into
the
chapel
the
organ
burst
out
into
the
strains
of
see
the
conquering
hero
comes
he
stood
by
the
altar
waiting
for
his
bride
and
in
a
short
time
she
appeared
escorted
by
the
lord
chamberlain
she
wore
a
dress
of
heavy
white
satin
woven
in
england
her
veil
had
made
scores
of
poor
women
happy
for
she
had
ordered
it
of
the
of
honiton
in
devon
she
wore
no
crown
but
only
a
wreath
of
orange
blossoms
she
had
diamond
earrings
and
necklace
and
a
few
diamonds
in
her
hair
twelve
bridesmaids
in
white
tulle
and
white
roses
bore
her
train
and
a
hard
time
they
had
for
although
it
was
six
yards
long
they
found
it
too
short
for
so
many
bearers
one
of
them
wrote
we
were
all
huddled
together
and
scrambled
rather
than
walked
along
kicking
each
other
heels
and
treading
on
each
other
gowns
illustration
albert
prince
consort
in
the
uniform
of
a
field
marshal
at
the
moment
the
ring
was
placed
on
the
queen
finger
the
guns
in
the
park
and
at
the
tower
were
fired
and
the
bells
rang
out
their
merriest
peals
when
the
ceremony
was
over
the
party
returned
to
buckingham
palace
for
a
wedding
breakfast
the
bridesmaid
who
wrote
the
account
of
the
wedding
said
that
prince
albert
seemed
a
little
nervous
about
getting
into
the
carriage
with
a
lady
with
a
tail
six
yards
long
but
they
all
reached
the
palace
in
safety
after
the
breakfast
the
sunshine
at
last
beamed
down
upon
them
and
the
young
couple
sped
away
for
their
honeymoon
at
windsor
castle
chapter
vii
housekeeping
in
a
palace
common
people
may
make
a
wedding
tour
but
kings
and
queens
are
too
fully
occupied
to
afford
such
luxuries
the
sovereign
of
england
could
spend
her
honeymoon
in
windsor
castle
but
it
must
be
a
honeymoon
of
only
four
days
those
four
days
however
were
marked
by
a
freedom
which
she
had
never
enjoyed
before
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
could
talk
with
someone
of
her
own
age
without
having
to
be
on
her
guard
lest
what
she
said
should
be
repeated
and
do
harm
one
of
the
subjects
that
needed
to
be
discussed
and
to
be
reformed
was
the
royal
housekeeping
many
a
woman
living
in
a
cottage
is
quite
as
comfortable
as
the
queen
of
great
britain
was
in
three
men
the
lord
steward
the
lord
chamberlain
and
the
master
of
the
horse
were
supposed
to
have
the
management
of
the
household
these
persons
were
men
of
high
rank
and
their
offices
were
given
them
in
reward
for
their
political
services
rather
than
for
their
ability
to
manage
the
domestic
affairs
of
a
palace
of
course
they
were
entirely
too
stately
to
take
any
charge
themselves
of
the
housekeeping
and
they
did
not
delegate
their
power
to
anyone
in
the
palace
some
of
the
servants
were
under
one
of
these
three
and
some
were
under
another
no
one
was
at
the
head
of
the
house
and
everyone
did
about
as
he
chose
if
the
queen
rang
a
bell
for
a
servant
the
servant
might
answer
it
or
he
might
be
absent
from
the
palace
just
as
it
happened
and
the
queen
was
helpless
for
the
only
one
at
all
responsible
was
some
aristocratic
nobleman
who
was
perhaps
far
away
on
a
yachting
trip
when
the
prime
minister
of
france
was
a
guest
at
windsor
he
wandered
over
the
palace
for
an
hour
trying
to
find
his
bedroom
for
there
was
no
one
on
duty
to
point
it
out
to
him
at
last
he
was
sure
that
he
had
it
and
he
opened
the
door
behold
there
stood
a
maid
brushing
the
hair
of
a
lady
who
sat
at
a
toilet
table
and
could
see
in
the
glass
the
embarrassed
gentleman
as
he
hurriedly
retreated
the
next
day
he
discovered
that
the
lady
before
the
glass
was
her
majesty
baron
stockmar
wrote
that
cleaning
the
inside
of
the
windows
belonged
to
one
department
and
cleaning
the
outside
to
another
it
is
quite
probable
that
when
the
little
princess
victoria
asked
queen
adelaide
to
let
her
clean
the
windows
there
was
visible
need
of
such
work
the
servants
of
one
department
brought
the
wood
and
laid
the
fire
but
it
was
not
their
work
to
light
it
and
for
that
duty
a
servant
from
another
department
must
be
called
a
pane
of
glass
could
not
be
mended
without
the
signatures
of
five
different
officials
no
one
was
responsible
for
the
cleanness
of
the
house
or
even
for
its
safety
and
if
the
man
whose
business
it
was
to
guard
an
entrance
preferred
to
do
something
else
there
was
no
one
to
interfere
with
his
pleasure
the
doors
were
indeed
so
carelessly
guarded
that
one
night
a
boy
was
found
under
a
sofa
in
the
room
next
to
the
bedroom
he
could
not
be
punished
as
a
thief
for
he
had
stolen
nothing
he
was
not
a
housebreaker
for
he
had
simply
walked
in
through
open
doors
and
no
one
had
been
on
guard
to
prevent
such
intrusions
it
was
finally
decided
that
he
was
a
vagabond
and
he
was
imprisoned
for
three
months
prince
albert
was
very
anxious
to
have
better
management
of
the
household
and
he
laid
the
matter
before
the
prime
minister
but
men
of
high
rank
are
now
eager
to
hold
these
offices
in
the
royal
household
was
the
reply
and
it
will
make
trouble
if
anyone
is
put
over
them
or
if
there
is
any
interference
with
their
departments
true
replied
the
prince
but
the
household
machinery
is
so
clumsy
and
works
so
ill
that
as
long
as
its
wheels
are
not
mended
there
can
be
neither
order
nor
regularity
comfort
security
nor
outward
dignity
in
the
queen
palace
reforms
began
but
the
prince
had
to
work
very
slowly
and
some
years
passed
before
either
the
queen
or
her
guests
could
live
in
comfort
if
the
queen
had
insisted
upon
these
changes
being
made
at
once
many
of
them
could
probably
have
been
carried
out
but
the
bedchamber
plot
had
taught
her
that
the
sovereign
must
not
act
contrary
to
the
wishes
of
her
people
there
was
especial
need
of
care
at
the
time
within
hardly
more
than
half
a
century
the
american
colonies
had
freed
themselves
from
england
and
become
a
republic
france
had
had
a
terrible
revolution
throughout
europe
people
were
thinking
of
change
of
more
power
for
the
people
and
less
for
the
government
in
england
there
was
little
probability
of
a
revolution
but
it
was
more
than
two
hundred
years
since
there
had
been
any
general
and
lasting
enthusiasm
for
the
monarch
of
the
realm
and
both
prince
albert
and
the
queen
felt
that
the
only
way
to
make
the
throne
strong
and
enduring
was
to
win
the
affection
of
the
people
this
was
the
teaching
of
baron
stockmar
the
faithful
friend
and
adviser
of
the
royal
couple
they
appreciated
his
devotion
and
all
the
more
because
they
could
do
nothing
for
him
he
did
not
care
for
money
or
office
and
he
was
absolutely
independent
when
dinner
was
over
he
did
not
trouble
himself
to
go
to
the
drawing
room
unless
he
felt
inclined
he
would
generally
spend
the
winter
with
the
queen
but
he
disliked
and
when
he
wanted
to
go
home
to
his
family
he
left
the
palace
without
a
word
of
farewell
baron
stockmar
had
good
pupils
prince
albert
was
not
yet
at
the
time
of
his
marriage
and
the
question
had
arisen
whether
as
he
was
not
of
age
he
could
legally
take
the
oath
that
was
required
of
every
member
of
the
council
soon
after
the
marriage
king
leopold
asked
an
english
lady
about
him
do
the
english
like
him
will
he
be
popular
inquired
the
king
they
call
him
very
handsome
was
her
reply
but
the
english
are
always
ready
to
find
fault
with
foreigners
and
they
say
he
is
stiff
and
german
as
the
months
passed
however
the
english
learned
that
this
young
prince
was
a
remarkable
man
in
his
grasp
of
politics
his
talent
for
art
and
music
and
his
honest
and
unselfish
devotion
to
the
good
of
the
realm
what
was
more
they
showed
their
appreciation
by
an
act
of
parliament
the
country
was
not
yet
at
rest
about
the
succession
to
the
crown
if
the
queen
should
have
a
child
and
die
before
the
child
was
of
age
a
regent
would
be
necessary
parliament
discussed
the
question
and
named
the
prince
the
foreigner
as
regent
they
would
not
have
done
it
for
him
six
months
ago
declared
lord
melbourne
with
delight
the
queen
had
always
been
loved
by
the
whigs
and
just
about
this
time
a
great
wave
of
devotion
to
her
swept
through
not
only
their
ranks
but
also
those
of
the
tories
a
boy
of
seventeen
tried
to
shoot
her
not
because
he
hated
her
but
because
he
wished
to
be
notorious
the
queen
was
in
her
carriage
with
the
prince
when
the
attempt
was
made
she
drove
on
rapidly
to
tell
the
duchess
of
kent
that
she
was
safe
then
she
returned
to
the
park
where
hundreds
of
people
had
gathered
hoping
to
see
her
and
make
sure
that
she
was
not
injured
she
was
received
with
cheers
and
shouts
of
delight
and
all
the
horseback
riders
formed
in
line
on
both
sides
of
her
carriage
as
if
they
were
her
bodyguard
when
she
appeared
at
the
opera
a
few
days
later
she
was
greeted
with
a
whirlwind
of
cheers
and
shouts
the
whole
house
sang
god
save
the
queen
then
they
pleased
her
still
more
by
crying
the
prince
the
prince
and
when
prince
albert
stepped
to
the
front
he
was
cheered
so
heartily
that
she
knew
he
was
fast
winning
the
hearts
of
her
people
operas
and
popularity
were
not
the
only
things
to
be
thought
of
in
those
days
the
royal
couple
barely
years
of
age
were
working
hard
on
constitutional
history
they
were
very
anxious
too
about
the
possibility
of
war
with
france
on
account
of
trouble
in
regard
to
turkey
and
egypt
and
when
their
little
daughter
was
born
in
november
the
queen
said
i
really
think
she
ought
to
be
named
the
little
girl
was
not
named
but
victoria
adelaide
mary
louise
and
she
had
to
wait
three
months
for
her
name
as
the
christening
did
not
take
place
until
february
she
was
baptized
with
water
brought
from
the
river
jordan
the
font
was
not
taken
from
the
tower
as
it
had
been
for
her
mother
baptism
but
a
new
one
was
made
of
silver
marked
with
her
and
also
those
of
her
father
and
her
mother
she
was
a
very
decorous
little
princess
and
the
proud
father
wrote
home
to
coburg
that
she
behaved
with
great
propriety
and
did
not
cry
at
all
there
was
much
rejoicing
at
the
birth
of
this
princess
royal
but
when
a
year
later
a
prince
was
born
then
the
delight
of
the
nation
knew
no
bounds
he
was
the
heir
to
the
throne
and
it
was
impossible
to
do
too
much
to
celebrate
his
birth
punch
said
huzza
we
a
little
prince
at
last
a
roaring
royal
boy
and
all
day
long
the
booming
bells
have
rung
their
peals
of
joy
and
the
little
park
guns
have
blazed
away
and
made
a
tremendous
noise
whilst
the
air
has
been
filled
since
eleven
with
the
shouts
of
little
boys
one
or
two
questions
in
regard
to
the
celebration
had
to
be
settled
by
the
courts
of
justice
it
was
an
old
privilege
that
when
an
heir
to
the
throne
was
born
the
officer
on
guard
at
james
palace
should
be
promoted
to
the
rank
of
major
in
this
case
the
child
was
born
at
buckingham
but
the
guard
at
james
demanded
his
promotion
nevertheless
the
matter
was
complicated
by
the
fact
that
the
change
of
sentry
had
chanced
to
occur
just
at
the
time
of
the
birth
of
the
prince
and
whether
the
old
or
the
new
guard
actually
held
the
keys
was
a
difficult
question
to
determine
another
difficulty
of
the
same
kind
arose
at
chester
the
prince
had
the
title
of
earl
of
chester
and
the
mayor
of
that
city
declared
that
by
ancient
right
he
had
claim
to
a
baronetcy
exactly
the
same
question
arose
as
with
the
sentinels
for
at
about
the
moment
when
the
keys
were
transferred
the
new
mayor
was
taking
the
oath
of
office
all
england
rejoiced
but
across
the
water
in
germany
was
a
man
who
was
not
at
all
pleased
to
hear
that
a
son
and
heir
was
born
to
victoria
for
he
had
always
had
a
lingering
hope
that
he
might
yet
become
king
of
great
britain
his
said
that
king
ernest
was
generally
when
he
heard
from
england
and
he
was
indignant
enough
when
he
was
not
asked
to
become
his
godfather
who
should
be
the
chief
sponsor
was
a
weighty
matter
but
baron
stockmar
advice
was
followed
and
the
king
of
prussia
was
invited
to
take
the
place
of
honor
the
queen
wished
the
little
prince
named
albert
for
the
husband
who
was
so
dear
to
her
and
edward
for
the
father
whom
she
could
not
remember
and
these
names
were
given
him
this
small
prince
was
an
expensive
baby
for
it
is
said
that
the
festivities
at
his
christening
cost
at
least
the
queen
gave
him
the
title
of
prince
of
wales
when
he
was
only
a
month
old
by
signing
an
interesting
bit
of
parchment
which
declared
that
she
girded
him
with
a
sword
and
put
a
golden
rod
into
his
hands
that
he
might
direct
and
defend
the
land
of
the
welsh
in
all
these
regal
honors
and
rejoicings
the
little
baby
sister
was
not
forgotten
and
the
queen
wrote
in
her
journal
albert
brought
in
dearest
little
pussy
in
such
a
smart
merino
dress
trimmed
with
blue
which
mamma
had
given
her
and
a
pretty
cap
she
was
very
dear
and
good
the
children
father
and
mother
would
have
been
very
glad
to
forget
all
outside
cares
and
splendors
and
live
quietly
by
themselves
but
that
could
not
be
there
was
much
to
think
of
and
many
subjects
concerning
which
they
felt
anxiety
one
of
these
was
the
change
of
government
for
a
little
before
the
birth
of
the
prince
the
event
took
place
which
the
queen
had
dreaded
so
long
the
victory
of
the
tories
and
the
resignation
of
lord
melbourne
never
was
a
retiring
minister
more
generous
to
his
opponents
and
more
thoughtful
of
the
comfort
of
his
sovereign
soon
after
his
resignation
he
had
a
little
conversation
with
greville
about
the
tories
have
you
any
means
of
speaking
to
these
chaps
he
asked
certainly
answered
greville
i
think
there
are
one
or
two
things
peel
ought
to
be
told
said
lord
melbourne
and
i
wish
you
would
tell
him
when
he
wishes
to
propose
anything
he
must
tell
the
queen
his
reasons
she
is
not
conceited
she
knows
there
are
many
things
which
she
does
not
understand
and
she
likes
to
have
them
explained
sir
robert
was
grateful
for
the
advice
and
followed
it
it
was
not
pleasant
for
him
to
become
prime
minister
for
although
the
queen
treated
him
with
the
utmost
courtesy
he
knew
that
she
looked
upon
him
as
responsible
for
cutting
down
the
grant
to
prince
albert
and
for
opposing
her
wish
to
give
the
prince
precedence
next
to
herself
peel
had
done
exactly
what
he
thought
was
right
but
he
could
not
help
feeling
sensitive
when
he
was
brought
into
so
close
relationship
with
the
queen
and
knew
that
this
relationship
was
not
welcome
to
her
any
man
with
the
feelings
of
a
gentleman
would
be
annoyed
at
having
unavoidably
given
her
so
much
pain
he
said
moreover
he
was
exceedingly
shy
so
shy
that
he
makes
me
shy
said
the
queen
fortunately
sir
robert
and
prince
albert
found
that
they
had
much
in
common
in
their
love
for
literature
and
art
and
the
queen
could
not
help
liking
the
man
who
showed
such
warm
appreciation
of
the
husband
whom
she
adored
very
soon
peel
paid
him
a
compliment
that
completely
won
her
heart
the
new
houses
of
parliament
were
to
be
decorated
and
there
was
a
strong
desire
felt
by
all
who
were
interested
in
art
that
they
should
be
so
artistic
as
to
be
an
honor
to
the
country
peel
invited
the
prince
to
become
the
chairman
of
the
commission
which
was
to
control
the
matter
this
position
gave
him
the
best
of
opportunities
to
become
connected
with
the
prominent
men
of
the
country
and
both
prince
and
queen
were
grateful
to
peel
for
his
thoughtfulness
the
queen
came
to
appreciate
the
tory
premier
then
she
saw
that
the
tories
were
not
so
black
as
they
were
painted
and
before
the
end
of
victoria
was
no
longer
queen
of
the
whigs
but
queen
of
all
her
people
the
queen
had
no
easy
life
she
has
most
of
the
toil
and
least
of
the
enjoyments
of
the
world
wrote
her
husband
she
had
also
much
of
the
danger
without
an
enemy
in
the
world
she
was
shot
at
twice
during
the
summer
of
by
men
who
seemed
to
have
no
motive
for
such
a
deed
when
peel
heard
of
the
attempt
on
her
life
he
hurried
to
the
palace
to
consult
with
the
prince
the
queen
entered
the
room
and
the
shy
cold
minister
actually
wept
tears
of
joy
at
her
safety
after
that
there
was
no
question
about
the
friendliness
between
the
queen
and
her
premier
just
how
these
assassins
should
be
punished
was
an
important
matter
and
here
the
common
sense
of
the
sovereign
found
a
way
out
of
the
dilemma
it
is
a
mistake
she
said
to
treat
such
attempts
as
high
treason
for
it
dignifies
the
crime
and
makes
the
criminals
feel
that
they
are
bold
and
daring
men
parliament
learned
from
her
wisdom
and
passed
a
bill
punishing
any
attempt
upon
the
sovereign
life
by
imprisonment
and
flogging
this
had
so
good
an
effect
that
the
queen
saw
seven
years
of
peace
before
another
attempt
was
made
to
injure
her
in
spite
of
all
these
dangers
and
political
responsibilities
victoria
was
radiantly
happy
the
home
life
was
all
that
she
could
have
asked
she
and
the
prince
were
not
only
husband
and
wife
they
were
the
best
of
comrades
whenever
they
could
win
a
little
leisure
from
the
cares
of
state
they
read
and
sketched
and
sang
together
music
gave
them
both
the
most
intense
pleasure
and
both
had
rare
musical
ability
which
had
been
carefully
cultivated
mendelssohn
describes
a
visit
to
them
which
he
seems
to
have
enjoyed
as
much
as
they
the
great
composer
says
that
he
found
prince
albert
alone
but
as
they
were
looking
at
the
new
organ
and
trying
the
different
stops
the
queen
came
in
wearing
a
very
simple
morning
gown
i
am
glad
that
you
have
come
she
said
we
love
your
music
and
it
is
a
great
pleasure
to
have
you
with
us
i
thank
your
majesty
replied
the
guest
and
he
went
on
to
speak
of
the
beauty
of
the
organ
yes
it
is
indeed
fine
said
the
queen
but
then
i
think
any
instrument
fine
when
the
prince
is
playing
on
it
but
what
confusion
she
exclaimed
glancing
around
the
room
the
wind
had
scattered
leaves
of
music
over
the
floor
even
on
the
pedals
of
the
organ
and
she
knelt
down
and
began
to
pick
them
up
prince
albert
and
mendelssohn
started
to
help
but
she
said
no
go
on
with
the
stops
and
i
will
put
things
straight
will
you
not
play
something
for
me
begged
mendelssohn
of
the
prince
and
added
so
i
can
boast
about
it
in
germany
the
prince
played
while
the
queen
sat
by
him
listening
and
looking
perfectly
happy
then
mendelssohn
played
his
chorus
how
lovely
are
the
messengers
but
before
he
was
at
the
end
of
the
first
verse
his
royal
hosts
were
singing
with
him
it
is
beautiful
said
the
queen
have
you
written
any
new
songs
i
am
very
fond
of
your
old
ones
you
ought
to
sing
one
for
him
suggested
the
prince
if
you
only
will
pleaded
mendelssohn
i
will
try
the
lied
she
said
if
it
is
here
but
i
am
afraid
that
all
my
music
is
packed
to
go
to
claremont
prince
albert
went
to
look
for
it
but
when
he
returned
he
reported
that
it
was
already
packed
but
could
it
perhaps
be
unpacked
suggested
mendelssohn
daringly
it
shall
be
said
the
queen
we
must
send
to
lady
frances
the
bell
was
rung
and
the
servants
were
sent
to
find
the
music
but
they
were
unsuccessful
i
will
go
the
queen
declared
and
she
left
the
room
while
she
was
gone
the
prince
said
she
begs
that
you
will
accept
this
present
as
a
remembrance
and
he
gave
the
composer
a
beautiful
ring
marked
r
when
the
queen
returned
she
said
it
is
really
most
annoying
all
my
things
are
gone
to
claremont
please
do
not
make
me
suffer
for
the
accident
begged
mendelssohn
and
at
last
another
song
was
chosen
she
really
sang
it
charmingly
he
wrote
in
a
letter
but
when
he
told
her
so
she
exclaimed
oh
if
i
only
had
not
been
so
frightened
the
prince
sang
and
mendelssohn
gave
them
one
of
his
wonderful
improvisations
then
the
musician
took
his
leave
but
do
come
to
england
again
soon
and
pay
us
a
visit
said
the
queen
earnestly
as
he
made
his
farewells
running
about
to
see
the
world
was
not
so
common
an
amusement
in
the
first
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
as
it
is
neither
were
railroads
as
common
and
the
queen
of
england
was
years
of
age
before
she
ever
made
a
journey
by
rail
this
new
way
of
traveling
produced
quite
a
disturbance
among
some
of
her
attendants
the
master
of
horse
said
that
as
it
was
his
business
to
arrange
for
her
journeys
he
must
assure
himself
that
the
engine
was
in
proper
condition
and
much
to
the
amusement
of
the
engineer
he
appeared
at
the
railway
station
several
hours
before
the
train
was
to
start
that
he
might
inspect
the
engine
as
if
it
were
a
horse
there
was
even
more
difficulty
in
satisfying
the
claims
of
the
coachman
when
the
queen
travels
it
is
my
business
to
drive
for
her
he
declared
therefore
i
must
at
least
be
on
the
engine
he
was
permitted
to
ride
on
the
pilot
engine
but
the
dust
and
cinders
made
such
havoc
with
his
scarlet
livery
and
his
white
gloves
that
he
concluded
not
to
press
his
claims
quite
so
urgently
in
future
this
famous
journey
was
only
minutes
long
and
in
spite
of
the
gorgeousness
of
crimson
carpets
laid
from
the
royal
carriage
to
the
train
it
could
not
have
been
especially
comfortable
for
airbrakes
and
good
roadbeds
were
inventions
yet
to
come
nevertheless
the
royal
lady
was
not
discouraged
in
her
desire
to
travel
and
in
the
autumn
of
she
and
the
prince
made
a
journey
to
scotland
much
that
she
saw
was
almost
as
new
to
her
as
it
would
have
been
to
any
village
maiden
who
had
never
left
her
home
and
she
was
interested
in
whatever
came
before
her
she
was
especially
delighted
with
edinburgh
it
is
beautiful
she
wrote
totally
unlike
anything
else
i
have
ever
seen
as
she
entered
the
city
she
was
met
by
the
royal
archers
bodyguard
this
was
an
association
formed
by
one
of
her
royal
ancestors
more
than
two
hundred
years
before
its
special
business
was
to
protect
the
sovereign
and
in
the
old
days
its
members
were
covered
from
head
to
foot
with
armor
long
before
victoria
time
the
armor
had
vanished
but
in
memory
of
the
olden
customs
each
man
carried
a
bow
in
one
hand
and
had
arrows
stuck
through
his
belt
as
soon
as
the
queen
appeared
they
began
to
perform
their
ancient
office
walking
close
beside
the
carriage
all
the
way
through
the
town
in
this
journey
the
queen
and
prince
albert
were
received
by
various
noblemen
but
the
most
picturesque
greeting
was
at
the
home
of
lord
breadalbane
at
taymouth
as
they
drove
up
to
the
castle
the
gates
were
thrown
open
and
there
stood
their
host
in
a
highland
dress
at
the
head
of
a
company
of
highlanders
who
were
gorgeous
in
the
tartan
of
the
campbells
pipers
were
playing
on
the
bagpipes
salutes
were
fired
the
soldiers
and
the
crowd
of
country
folk
cheered
over
and
over
again
when
the
royal
guests
went
into
the
house
and
were
escorted
up
the
wide
stone
staircase
long
lines
of
highlanders
in
kilts
stood
on
both
sides
of
the
hall
and
the
stairway
it
is
no
wonder
that
the
queen
wrote
in
her
journal
that
it
seemed
like
the
old
feudal
times
in
the
evening
the
gardens
were
illuminated
there
were
no
electric
lights
then
but
she
says
there
was
a
whole
chain
of
lamps
along
the
railing
and
on
the
ground
was
written
in
lamps
victoria
albert
bonfires
were
kindled
on
the
tops
of
the
hills
and
fireworks
were
set
off
then
the
bagpipes
began
to
play
torches
were
brought
on
the
lawn
in
front
of
the
house
and
by
their
wild
and
flaring
light
the
highlanders
danced
the
gayest
merriest
reels
that
can
be
imagined
the
visitors
spent
several
days
in
this
charming
place
a
ball
was
given
for
them
but
the
queen
seems
to
have
enjoyed
much
more
heartily
the
quiet
drives
that
she
took
about
the
country
the
row
up
the
lake
with
two
pipers
sitting
in
the
bow
of
the
boat
piping
and
singing
weird
gaelic
boat
songs
and
perhaps
most
of
all
the
little
picnics
they
had
and
the
walks
that
they
took
for
there
was
no
one
to
stare
at
them
and
they
roamed
about
in
perfect
freedom
guarded
only
by
two
highlanders
who
according
to
the
ancient
custom
followed
them
with
drawn
swords
wherever
they
went
illustration
the
queen
in
a
painting
by
john
during
the
next
two
or
three
years
the
queen
and
prince
albert
seized
every
opportunity
for
travel
short
though
their
journeys
had
to
be
they
visited
not
only
several
of
the
lordly
mansions
of
england
but
they
also
spent
a
few
days
in
belgium
and
made
a
short
stay
at
the
court
of
the
french
king
in
they
went
again
to
scotland
and
this
time
vicky
as
they
called
the
princess
royal
was
old
enough
to
go
with
them
there
were
two
more
children
in
the
royal
nursery
by
this
time
and
the
queen
wrote
in
her
journal
that
alice
and
the
baby
and
good
bertie
came
to
bid
the
travelers
farewell
she
was
quite
delighted
that
vicky
stood
at
the
window
of
a
little
inn
and
bowed
to
the
people
outside
one
of
her
hosts
on
this
visit
to
scotland
was
the
duke
of
argyll
she
describes
in
her
journal
his
son
the
old
marquis
of
lome
and
calls
him
such
a
merry
independent
little
child
one
of
the
disadvantages
of
being
a
sovereign
is
that
the
simplest
acts
are
looked
upon
as
being
of
political
significance
victoria
wished
to
meet
the
french
king
to
whom
prince
albert
was
distantly
related
and
she
did
not
wish
to
talk
politics
on
her
visit
to
france
she
was
interested
in
seeing
the
king
barge
and
its
many
oarsmen
in
white
with
red
sashes
in
the
royal
chapel
the
first
roman
catholic
church
that
she
had
ever
entered
in
the
little
picnic
that
the
king
ordered
in
the
forest
in
the
picturesque
white
caps
of
the
peasant
women
their
aprons
and
kerchiefs
and
she
noted
even
the
tone
of
the
church
bells
and
said
that
it
was
much
prettier
than
that
of
the
bells
in
england
she
enjoyed
her
visit
heartily
but
far
away
in
russia
the
emperor
nicholas
was
watching
her
movements
and
he
was
not
quite
pleased
the
government
of
turkey
will
soon
fall
to
pieces
he
said
to
himself
and
if
it
does
france
would
like
to
secure
a
piece
of
that
country
if
england
should
help
her
she
might
be
able
to
do
so
and
this
visit
looks
as
if
england
and
france
were
becoming
too
friendly
the
result
of
the
czar
meditations
was
that
word
was
sent
to
the
queen
that
he
was
on
his
way
to
visit
her
and
might
be
looked
for
at
once
queen
victoria
had
expected
him
to
come
the
following
year
but
he
liked
to
make
visits
in
this
sudden
fashion
and
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
prepare
for
him
as
best
she
could
in
hours
for
she
had
no
longer
time
in
which
to
make
ready
the
queen
had
not
been
especially
anxious
for
the
visit
she
feared
there
would
be
constraint
and
bustle
but
she
soon
found
that
quiet
simple
ways
of
living
were
most
pleasing
to
her
guest
and
she
wrote
to
king
leopold
he
is
very
easy
to
get
on
with
his
greatest
interest
was
in
military
matters
and
he
was
so
much
of
a
soldier
that
he
said
he
felt
without
his
uniform
almost
as
if
he
had
been
skinned
he
was
taken
to
a
review
of
course
and
this
he
thoroughly
enjoyed
you
allow
me
to
ride
down
the
line
he
asked
the
queen
so
i
can
see
my
old
comrades
down
the
line
he
went
and
was
greeted
everywhere
with
enthusiastic
cheers
when
the
duke
of
wellington
appeared
the
crowd
began
to
hurrah
for
him
for
the
man
who
had
won
the
battle
of
waterloo
was
the
nation
idol
please
do
please
do
he
said
riding
along
close
to
the
crowd
do
cheer
for
me
cheer
for
the
emperor
this
military
emperor
had
his
own
ideas
about
what
the
bed
of
a
soldier
should
be
even
if
the
soldier
was
at
the
head
of
an
empire
and
before
he
took
possession
of
his
bedroom
at
windsor
castle
he
had
his
set
up
and
sent
to
the
stables
for
straw
to
stuff
the
leathern
case
that
formed
his
mattress
the
emperor
was
delighted
with
his
visit
and
when
the
queen
invited
him
to
come
again
he
said
rather
sadly
you
do
not
know
how
difficult
it
is
for
us
to
do
such
things
then
he
kissed
the
royal
children
and
the
hand
of
the
queen
and
made
his
farewells
the
queen
kissed
him
as
sovereigns
are
expected
to
do
at
the
beginning
and
end
of
a
state
visit
and
the
reception
of
the
mighty
czar
was
over
by
living
in
the
same
house
together
quietly
and
unrestrainedly
i
not
only
see
these
great
people
but
know
them
said
the
queen
as
simply
as
if
she
herself
were
not
one
of
the
great
people
chapter
viii
a
home
of
our
own
it
is
very
delightful
to
live
in
palaces
and
entertain
kings
and
emperors
but
queen
victoria
palaces
belonged
to
the
english
nation
and
not
to
herself
and
as
has
been
said
their
royal
tenants
had
to
suffer
many
inconveniences
because
they
were
not
at
liberty
to
manage
their
own
housekeeping
as
they
chose
if
we
only
had
a
home
of
our
own
said
the
queen
and
prince
albert
to
each
other
and
at
last
they
decided
to
buy
one
they
talked
the
matter
over
with
sir
robert
peel
whom
they
had
come
to
look
upon
as
a
faithful
friend
and
he
told
them
of
a
beautiful
estate
which
was
for
sale
this
property
was
situated
on
the
isle
of
wight
it
was
far
enough
from
london
to
assure
them
of
privacy
and
it
was
so
near
that
there
need
be
no
delay
in
matters
of
government
in
this
charming
place
there
were
trees
and
valleys
and
hills
a
wide
stretch
of
with
the
woods
growing
almost
to
the
water
edge
and
best
of
all
the
royal
family
could
walk
and
drive
and
wander
about
without
feeling
that
they
were
on
continual
exhibition
there
was
a
palace
at
brighton
which
the
queen
had
sometimes
occupied
for
the
sake
of
being
near
the
sea
but
brighton
had
become
so
much
of
a
city
and
the
houses
had
clustered
so
closely
about
the
palace
that
there
was
no
longer
any
view
of
the
ocean
from
the
lower
windows
and
no
member
of
the
royal
family
could
go
outside
of
the
grounds
without
being
followed
by
inquisitive
crowds
at
osborne
as
the
new
purchase
was
named
there
was
perfect
freedom
perhaps
the
grown
ups
of
the
household
appreciated
the
liberty
indoors
quite
as
much
as
that
out
of
doors
for
here
there
were
no
departments
to
consult
and
if
a
pane
of
glass
was
broken
there
was
no
need
of
sending
over
the
kingdom
for
the
signatures
of
five
men
before
it
could
be
mended
the
house
was
pretty
but
it
was
too
small
and
a
new
one
had
to
be
built
prince
albert
made
all
the
plans
for
it
and
he
was
as
eager
as
the
queen
to
get
into
a
home
of
their
own
nevertheless
even
in
his
eagerness
he
did
not
forget
the
good
of
others
the
longer
the
work
of
building
and
beautifying
the
grounds
lasted
the
better
it
was
for
the
workmen
and
so
when
harvest
time
came
he
discharged
large
numbers
of
his
men
saying
work
in
the
fields
now
then
when
the
harvest
is
in
come
to
me
and
you
shall
have
work
here
again
the
cost
of
the
house
came
from
the
queen
own
purse
from
the
regular
grant
made
her
by
parliament
though
most
sovereigns
have
called
upon
the
nation
to
build
whatever
dwellings
they
thought
desirable
the
people
of
the
kingdom
were
pleased
to
hear
the
english
court
called
the
most
magnificent
in
europe
and
many
statesmen
expected
that
when
a
new
palace
was
to
be
built
or
a
royal
guest
to
be
entertained
the
sovereign
would
ask
parliament
for
a
special
grant
of
money
to
pay
the
expense
frequently
far
more
was
expected
of
members
of
the
royal
family
than
their
purses
could
provide
and
then
came
debts
king
leopold
had
not
been
able
to
live
within
his
grant
and
the
duke
of
kent
had
left
indebtedness
at
his
death
the
little
princess
who
had
not
been
allowed
to
buy
a
box
until
she
had
the
money
to
pay
for
it
meant
now
that
she
was
on
the
throne
to
carry
out
the
principle
on
which
she
had
been
brought
up
the
first
thing
that
she
did
was
to
pay
her
father
debts
and
while
living
in
as
much
splendor
as
her
people
desired
she
managed
her
income
so
well
that
she
could
afford
to
build
a
palace
if
she
chose
prince
albert
heartily
approved
of
this
wise
economy
and
he
carried
out
the
same
plan
in
managing
the
farm
of
the
new
estate
he
spent
lavishly
in
improving
the
land
but
unlike
most
fancy
farmers
he
made
his
costly
improvements
so
skillfully
that
they
were
paid
for
in
the
generous
increase
in
crops
when
the
new
house
was
done
there
was
a
joyful
homecoming
as
the
queen
passed
through
the
door
one
of
the
maids
of
honor
threw
an
old
shoe
after
her
to
bring
good
luck
she
said
to
the
prince
entering
into
the
new
home
brought
memories
of
his
childhood
in
coburg
and
after
the
first
dinner
he
said
we
have
a
hymn
in
germany
for
such
occasions
it
begins
bless
o
god
our
going
forth
bless
thou
too
our
coming
in
so
it
was
that
the
new
house
was
opened
not
only
the
grown
folk
but
the
merry
little
company
of
princes
and
princesses
were
very
happy
in
it
whenever
a
few
days
could
be
spared
for
its
pleasures
as
they
grew
older
a
swiss
cottage
was
built
for
them
and
this
was
house
there
was
a
charming
little
kitchen
with
a
cooking
stove
so
that
the
girls
could
try
all
sorts
of
experiments
in
the
cooking
line
and
happy
they
were
when
they
could
persuade
their
father
and
mother
to
partake
of
a
banquet
of
their
own
preparing
the
boys
had
a
forge
and
a
carpenter
bench
where
they
built
small
boats
and
chairs
and
tables
and
wheelbarrows
every
child
had
a
garden
and
there
he
raised
not
only
flowers
but
fruit
and
vegetables
in
this
little
paradise
the
children
did
what
they
liked
but
they
were
shown
the
best
way
of
doing
it
a
gardener
taught
them
how
to
manage
their
gardens
and
whenever
their
vegetables
were
a
success
they
either
gave
them
away
or
sold
them
at
market
price
to
the
royal
kitchen
prince
albert
himself
taught
the
boys
how
to
use
tools
and
helped
them
to
begin
a
museum
of
insects
minerals
and
all
sorts
of
curiosities
like
the
one
that
he
and
his
brother
ernest
had
had
in
coburg
when
they
were
boys
not
only
at
osborne
but
wherever
the
royal
children
were
they
were
brought
up
as
simply
as
the
queen
herself
had
been
whatever
material
was
bought
for
their
clothes
had
to
be
shown
to
the
queen
and
if
it
was
rich
or
expensive
she
would
refuse
to
allow
it
to
be
used
as
soon
as
the
princes
and
princesses
were
old
enough
they
were
taught
to
take
as
much
care
of
their
clothes
as
if
they
had
been
a
poor
children
one
of
their
nurses
wrote
that
they
had
quite
poor
living
only
a
bit
of
roast
beef
and
perhaps
a
plain
pudding
and
she
added
the
queen
is
as
fit
to
have
been
a
poor
man
wife
as
a
queen
baron
stockmar
was
consulted
on
all
nursery
questions
and
he
said
that
it
was
more
difficult
to
manage
a
nursery
than
a
kingdom
the
queen
tried
to
make
her
children
understand
that
they
were
no
better
than
other
children
just
because
they
were
princes
or
princesses
and
they
were
obliged
to
behave
with
perfect
courtesy
to
the
servants
of
the
palace
as
well
as
to
kings
and
emperors
it
is
said
that
once
upon
a
time
two
of
the
children
thought
it
very
amusing
to
take
possession
of
the
brushes
and
blacken
the
face
of
a
woman
who
was
cleaning
a
stove
but
when
the
queen
mother
discovered
their
prank
she
took
the
small
culprits
by
the
hand
and
led
them
to
the
woman
room
and
made
them
apologize
most
humbly
the
little
princess
royal
vicky
was
so
independent
a
young
lady
that
she
would
sometimes
break
through
her
mother
teachings
the
story
is
told
that
one
day
a
sailor
lifted
her
on
board
the
royal
yacht
saying
as
he
sat
her
down
there
you
are
my
little
lady
i
a
princess
i
not
a
little
lady
the
child
retorted
but
the
watchful
mother
was
listening
and
she
said
that
is
true
tell
the
kind
sailor
that
you
are
not
a
little
lady
yet
but
that
you
hope
to
be
some
day
occasionally
this
willful
little
princess
preferred
to
bear
a
punishment
rather
than
give
up
her
own
way
the
queen
and
the
prince
addressed
brown
as
brown
and
the
small
child
followed
their
example
you
will
be
sent
to
bed
if
you
do
that
again
said
the
queen
but
the
next
morning
when
brown
appeared
the
little
girl
said
with
special
distinctness
good
morning
brown
and
good
night
brown
for
i
going
to
bed
brown
and
with
her
saucy
little
head
high
in
the
air
she
marched
off
to
bed
happy
as
the
queen
and
the
prince
were
in
their
home
life
one
subject
in
connection
with
her
husband
always
troubled
the
loving
wife
and
that
was
the
annoying
question
of
precedence
she
wrote
of
him
in
her
journal
he
is
above
me
in
everything
really
and
therefore
i
wish
that
he
should
be
equal
in
rank
to
me
in
england
she
could
put
the
prince
where
she
wished
him
to
be
but
parliament
had
given
him
no
rank
and
therefore
out
of
england
some
sovereigns
like
king
ernest
positively
refused
to
grant
him
any
honors
that
were
not
due
to
the
younger
son
of
the
duke
of
coburg
and
when
precedence
was
accorded
him
the
queen
had
to
express
gratitude
as
for
a
personal
favor
to
herself
unknown
to
the
prince
she
had
a
long
talk
on
the
subject
with
baron
stockmar
i
wish
him
to
have
the
title
of
king
consort
she
said
earnestly
a
king
consort
without
the
authority
of
a
king
would
be
a
novelty
replied
the
baron
and
the
english
people
do
not
like
anything
for
which
there
is
no
precedent
queen
anne
husband
was
never
called
king
but
queen
anne
husband
was
stupid
and
insignificant
declared
the
queen
there
has
never
been
a
case
like
ours
before
albert
and
i
reign
together
he
is
sovereign
as
much
as
i
we
discuss
all
matters
and
decide
together
true
admitted
the
baron
but
the
constitution
does
not
provide
for
such
a
condition
of
affairs
i
will
talk
with
peel
about
it
peel
felt
as
stockmar
did
that
it
was
not
wise
to
propose
such
a
title
the
subject
arose
again
some
years
later
and
the
shrewd
baron
wrote
to
the
prince
in
his
usual
straightforward
fashion
never
abandon
your
firm
powerful
position
to
run
after
butterflies
you
have
the
substance
stick
by
it
the
title
was
never
given
him
but
it
was
true
that
he
had
the
substance
the
queen
no
longer
met
her
ministers
alone
the
prince
was
always
with
her
to
help
and
suggest
whenever
either
she
or
the
prince
spoke
to
the
council
the
word
i
was
not
used
it
was
always
we
think
should
be
done
not
only
the
council
but
the
whole
country
were
gaining
in
knowledge
of
the
prince
wisdom
and
devotion
to
the
good
of
the
kingdom
and
in
a
valued
mark
of
appreciation
was
given
him
in
his
election
as
chancellor
of
the
university
of
cambridge
one
of
the
greatest
honors
that
could
have
been
bestowed
upon
him
the
queen
was
delighted
because
she
knew
that
the
position
was
not
given
out
of
compliment
to
her
but
was
something
that
he
himself
had
earned
soon
after
the
election
came
the
installation
the
magistrates
and
yeomanry
went
to
the
station
to
meet
the
queen
and
then
marched
before
her
into
the
town
she
was
escorted
into
the
great
hall
of
trinity
college
and
led
to
an
armchair
which
stood
on
a
platform
under
a
canopy
soon
after
she
had
seated
herself
the
new
chancellor
entered
at
the
farther
end
of
the
hall
followed
by
the
long
line
of
university
dignitaries
he
wore
a
robe
of
black
and
gold
so
long
that
it
had
to
be
held
up
by
two
gentlemen
when
he
stood
in
front
of
the
armchair
that
represented
the
throne
he
made
a
low
bow
and
delivered
his
address
the
situation
was
almost
absurd
for
us
said
the
queen
afterwards
but
the
prince
read
his
address
with
perfect
command
of
his
countenance
and
the
queen
was
quite
serious
until
she
caught
his
eye
for
a
moment
at
the
end
of
the
speech
she
half
smiled
but
in
an
instant
she
was
again
the
dignified
sovereign
and
she
declared
with
a
little
emphasis
that
brought
forth
shouts
of
applause
the
choice
which
the
university
has
made
of
a
chancellor
has
my
most
entire
approbation
not
long
afterwards
the
new
chancellor
and
his
royal
wife
paid
another
visit
to
cambridge
it
was
a
little
muddy
and
the
queen
hesitated
a
moment
before
getting
out
of
the
carriage
instantly
one
of
the
students
threw
his
gown
upon
the
ground
for
her
to
step
on
and
others
followed
his
example
when
victoria
thought
of
her
husband
and
her
children
she
was
supremely
happy
but
when
she
thought
of
the
different
kingdoms
of
europe
and
even
of
her
own
realm
there
was
much
in
and
to
make
her
unhappy
all
europe
was
restless
and
uneasy
revolt
had
broken
out
in
italy
france
germany
and
other
countries
the
reigning
sovereigns
in
most
of
these
kingdoms
were
related
to
her
either
by
blood
or
by
marriage
and
she
could
but
feel
grief
for
their
trials
and
in
some
instances
fear
for
their
safety
indeed
the
king
and
queen
of
france
had
to
flee
to
england
and
they
spent
the
remainder
of
their
lives
at
claremont
in
victoria
own
realm
there
was
trouble
ireland
was
suffering
from
a
terrible
famine
thousands
of
irish
were
dying
of
either
starvation
or
fever
in
england
there
was
no
starvation
but
everyone
felt
the
hard
times
more
or
less
those
who
had
money
did
not
dare
to
invest
it
because
business
was
so
unsettled
that
they
were
afraid
of
loss
as
capital
was
not
invested
there
was
little
work
to
be
had
and
the
poor
suffered
severely
the
rich
as
well
as
the
poor
felt
the
general
stagnation
greville
said
that
his
income
was
only
half
the
usual
amount
and
even
in
royal
palaces
strict
economy
was
practiced
there
was
a
special
reason
for
great
uneasiness
in
london
according
to
the
laws
at
that
time
no
one
could
become
a
member
of
the
house
of
commons
who
did
not
own
land
enough
to
receive
from
it
an
annual
income
of
this
law
had
been
made
in
the
belief
that
a
man
who
owned
land
would
be
more
interested
in
the
welfare
of
his
country
than
a
man
who
had
none
thousands
of
workingmen
were
not
allowed
even
to
vote
when
work
was
plenty
and
they
were
comfortable
and
busy
they
did
not
think
so
much
about
their
rights
but
when
work
failed
they
began
to
say
to
one
another
this
is
all
the
fault
of
the
laws
if
everyone
could
vote
and
if
poor
men
as
well
as
rich
men
could
become
members
of
parliament
laws
would
be
made
for
the
good
of
the
whole
nation
and
not
merely
for
the
landowners
these
men
held
meetings
to
discuss
such
matters
and
they
concluded
to
send
in
a
petition
to
parliament
setting
forth
their
wrongs
and
demanding
that
changes
should
be
made
the
plan
was
explained
in
what
was
called
the
people
charter
and
therefore
its
supporters
were
spoken
of
as
chartists
no
one
would
have
objected
to
having
as
many
petitions
sent
to
parliament
as
the
house
would
hold
but
among
the
people
were
many
persons
who
had
much
to
say
about
oppression
and
revolution
the
crowds
sometimes
became
noisy
and
turbulent
and
one
evening
some
of
them
rushed
wildly
toward
buckingham
palace
the
only
harm
that
they
did
was
to
break
some
street
lamps
and
when
their
leader
was
arrested
by
the
police
he
made
no
resistance
but
began
to
cry
nevertheless
people
felt
very
uneasy
and
when
it
was
reported
that
on
the
of
april
the
petition
would
be
presented
by
men
there
was
much
alarm
in
the
city
shops
were
barricaded
weapons
were
put
where
they
could
be
caught
up
in
a
moment
and
old
muskets
that
had
not
been
used
for
half
a
century
were
brought
down
from
the
garrets
and
put
in
order
for
the
riots
that
were
feared
the
duke
of
wellington
as
of
the
army
made
very
wise
preparations
there
was
no
display
of
soldiers
or
cannon
but
buckingham
palace
and
the
public
buildings
were
quietly
filled
with
armed
men
and
gunboats
were
brought
up
the
river
the
queen
had
shown
again
and
again
that
she
was
no
coward
and
she
would
have
stayed
in
london
but
her
ministers
persuaded
her
to
take
her
baby
to
osborne
house
all
london
trembled
when
the
of
april
arrived
but
when
night
came
those
who
had
feared
most
laughed
heartiest
the
whole
affair
had
ended
in
a
few
thousand
men
starting
for
parliament
with
the
petition
you
can
not
cross
the
bridge
in
mass
said
the
police
and
the
chartists
went
home
meekly
sending
their
petition
in
cabs
the
queen
had
long
wished
to
go
to
ireland
and
in
she
and
the
prince
and
the
four
older
children
went
to
that
country
in
the
yacht
and
now
however
indignant
the
irish
might
be
at
england
rule
of
their
country
they
would
not
give
the
queen
any
but
the
most
cordial
greeting
and
when
the
yacht
sailed
into
the
mouth
of
the
river
lee
the
people
of
the
place
called
cove
of
cork
asked
that
she
would
step
ashore
if
only
for
a
moment
we
wish
to
change
the
name
of
our
town
they
said
so
that
it
may
mark
the
place
where
the
queen
first
set
her
foot
on
irish
soil
the
flag
was
run
up
on
which
was
written
the
word
cove
but
as
soon
as
the
queen
had
gone
back
to
the
yacht
the
flag
was
dropped
and
another
was
run
up
marked
queenstown
the
and
went
on
to
cork
and
the
party
also
visited
several
other
places
in
ireland
wherever
they
went
the
crowds
pressed
to
the
water
edge
with
cheering
and
shouts
of
welcome
cannon
were
fired
and
bells
were
set
to
ringing
every
little
cottage
had
its
flag
or
at
least
a
wreath
of
flowers
and
evergreens
all
were
interested
in
the
royal
children
and
at
kingstown
an
old
lady
cried
out
oh
queen
dear
make
one
of
them
prince
patrick
and
all
ireland
will
die
for
you
when
the
irish
visit
had
come
to
its
end
and
the
queen
was
about
to
leave
for
england
the
crowds
on
the
shore
cheered
her
more
wildly
than
ever
and
both
the
queen
and
the
prince
climbed
the
paddlebox
and
waved
their
handkerchiefs
again
and
again
go
slowly
ordered
the
queen
and
the
boat
moved
very
slowly
along
keeping
close
to
the
pier
the
crowds
cheered
with
more
enthusiasm
than
before
and
three
times
a
return
was
given
to
their
salute
by
lowering
the
royal
standard
one
of
the
queen
party
said
there
is
not
an
individual
in
the
town
who
does
not
take
the
queen
going
on
the
paddlebox
and
lowering
the
royal
standard
as
a
personal
compliment
to
himself
the
year
following
the
visit
to
ireland
the
queen
seventh
child
was
born
a
boy
now
we
are
just
as
many
as
the
days
of
the
week
cried
the
brothers
and
sisters
joyfully
but
which
of
us
shall
be
sunday
asked
one
the
new
baby
answered
princess
vicky
decidedly
because
he
just
come
and
we
must
be
polite
to
him
and
give
him
the
best
the
little
boy
was
named
patrick
as
the
old
woman
in
ireland
had
suggested
but
his
first
name
was
arthur
for
the
duke
of
wellington
on
whose
birthday
he
was
born
the
days
of
the
queen
were
full
of
joys
and
sorrows
that
came
almost
hand
in
hand
her
home
life
was
perfectly
happy
but
her
duties
as
a
sovereign
took
much
time
that
she
would
have
gladly
given
to
her
family
it
is
hard
she
said
that
i
can
not
always
hear
my
children
say
their
prayers
she
had
the
warmest
most
devoted
friends
but
in
the
six
years
preceding
she
had
lost
several
who
could
never
be
replaced
sir
robert
peel
and
lord
melbourne
had
died
the
opposing
ministers
who
had
both
won
her
confidence
and
gratitude
and
the
good
queen
adelaide
who
had
loved
the
little
princess
victoria
as
if
she
had
been
her
own
child
was
also
gone
the
sorrow
which
prince
albert
felt
at
the
loss
of
his
father
had
been
to
his
wife
a
grief
almost
as
deep
and
both
she
and
the
prince
were
saddened
by
the
loss
of
the
coburg
grandmother
who
loved
him
so
that
she
was
almost
heartbroken
on
his
leaving
her
to
make
his
home
in
england
and
called
piteously
after
his
carriage
oh
albert
albert
the
three
who
had
been
nearest
to
the
queen
in
her
childhood
were
living
her
mother
davys
and
baroness
lehzen
the
kind
scholarly
clergyman
she
had
made
bishop
of
peterborough
and
she
saw
him
from
time
to
time
after
the
marriage
of
the
queen
the
baroness
lehzen
returned
to
her
friends
in
germany
but
the
busy
sovereign
found
time
to
send
her
long
and
frequent
letters
the
losses
of
the
queen
were
many
but
with
prince
albert
by
her
side
she
felt
that
she
could
bear
whatever
came
and
it
was
a
great
happiness
to
her
that
the
better
he
was
known
in
the
country
the
more
highly
the
nation
thought
of
him
they
could
hardly
help
esteeming
him
for
he
seemed
never
to
have
a
thought
of
himself
all
was
for
the
queen
and
for
her
people
for
several
years
he
had
had
a
plan
in
his
mind
for
a
great
industrial
exhibition
when
he
first
laid
the
scheme
before
the
public
the
people
were
wildly
enthusiastic
then
as
the
difficulties
arose
there
was
much
criticism
the
building
would
cost
and
subscriptions
were
slow
brought
out
a
cartoon
inscribed
please
to
remember
the
exposition
it
represented
a
boy
holding
out
his
cap
for
pennies
under
the
picture
was
written
pity
the
sorrows
of
a
poor
young
prince
whose
costly
scheme
has
borne
him
to
your
door
who
in
a
fix
the
matter
not
to
mince
oh
help
him
out
and
commerce
swell
your
store
prince
albert
laughed
heartily
at
the
cartoon
added
it
to
his
collection
and
worked
all
the
harder
for
the
exposition
there
was
much
opposition
to
admitting
foreign
exhibits
for
many
english
manufacturers
had
a
wild
fancy
that
the
sight
of
them
would
prevent
the
english
from
patronizing
home
products
all
the
villains
of
the
continent
will
be
here
declared
the
grumblers
they
will
murder
the
queen
and
begin
a
revolution
in
parliament
one
of
the
members
invoked
the
lightning
to
fall
from
heaven
and
destroy
the
building
nevertheless
enormous
masses
of
goods
were
constantly
arriving
and
the
mighty
structure
continued
to
rise
it
was
made
of
iron
and
glass
and
was
like
an
enormous
greenhouse
thackeray
wrote
of
it
and
see
is
done
as
though
by
a
wizard
rod
a
blazing
arch
of
lucid
glass
leaps
like
a
fountain
from
the
grass
to
meet
the
sun
the
crystal
palace
the
people
called
it
and
no
better
name
could
have
been
given
it
stretched
out
one
thousand
feet
in
length
and
part
of
it
was
one
hundred
feet
high
so
high
that
two
elm
trees
which
had
been
growing
on
its
site
grew
on
in
freedom
under
its
glass
roof
the
ironwork
was
painted
a
clear
bright
blue
there
were
scarlet
hangings
fountains
statues
banners
tapestries
flowers
palms
everything
that
could
make
it
bright
and
beautiful
may
had
been
named
as
the
day
of
opening
in
the
royal
family
the
day
began
with
birthday
gifts
for
the
little
arthur
toys
from
the
parents
a
clock
from
the
duchess
of
kent
and
strange
presents
for
a
baby
a
bronze
statuette
and
a
beautiful
from
the
prince
and
princess
of
prussia
long
before
noon
the
queen
the
prince
and
the
two
older
children
drove
to
the
crystal
palace
as
they
entered
there
was
a
flourish
of
trumpets
followed
by
tremendous
cheering
the
queen
was
radiant
with
happiness
as
she
walked
down
the
broad
aisle
with
her
husband
she
wore
a
pink
silk
dress
of
irish
poplin
and
on
her
head
was
a
diamond
tiara
she
led
by
the
hand
the
prince
of
wales
a
bright
handsome
little
fellow
the
princess
royal
wore
a
white
dress
and
on
her
head
was
a
wreath
of
roses
she
held
her
hand
the
cheers
grew
louder
and
louder
then
the
deep
tones
of
the
organ
broke
in
upon
them
the
music
of
two
hundred
instruments
and
six
hundred
voices
followed
leading
the
thousands
present
in
the
national
hymn
after
this
the
prince
left
the
side
of
the
queen
and
returning
at
the
head
of
the
commissioners
he
read
her
the
formal
report
she
made
a
short
reply
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
offered
up
prayer
and
the
wonderful
hallelujah
chorus
resounded
through
the
lofty
arches
while
this
was
being
sung
a
chinese
mandarin
who
had
been
walking
about
most
perfectly
at
his
ease
and
quite
indifferent
to
the
gazing
crowds
now
took
his
stand
before
the
queen
and
made
a
very
profound
obeisance
he
proved
to
be
of
considerable
use
a
little
later
for
when
the
long
procession
of
distinguished
englishmen
and
foreigners
was
formed
it
occurred
to
someone
that
china
was
not
represented
and
the
dignified
mandarin
was
taken
possession
of
as
an
addition
to
the
train
he
made
no
objections
but
marched
along
with
his
former
tranquillity
thinking
apparently
that
all
foreigners
were
treated
in
such
manner
by
those
remarkable
people
the
englishmen
the
duke
of
wellington
was
in
the
procession
and
the
walk
around
the
building
was
to
him
a
triumphal
progress
for
the
women
waved
their
handkerchiefs
and
kissed
their
hands
while
the
men
cheered
and
shouted
the
duke
the
duke
in
the
midst
of
all
his
glory
he
did
not
forget
his
little
namesake
and
godson
and
later
in
the
day
his
birthday
he
called
at
buckingham
palace
with
a
golden
cup
and
some
toys
of
his
own
selection
for
the
little
boy
so
ended
what
victoria
called
the
proudest
and
happiest
day
of
my
life
a
thousand
times
superior
to
the
coronation
in
her
journal
she
wrote

hurrah
few
men
in
england
worked
as
hard
as
prince
albert
the
uncrowned
king
if
a
corner
stone
of
a
school
a
hospital
or
a
public
building
was
to
be
laid
a
missionary
society
to
be
formed
some
new
docks
to
be
founded
a
museum
to

prince
albert
must
be
present
he
must
attend
naval
reviews
councils
to
discuss
reforms
at
cambridge
dinners
of
scientific
men
and
first
meetings
of
societies
to
aid
superannuated
servants
he
must
not
only
be
seen
but
he
must
be
heard
for
he
was
expected
to
make
a
speech
on
every
occasion
in
fact
whenever
he
opened
the
door
of
his
own
rooms
some
delegation
seemed
to
be
waiting
to
ask
him
to
attend
a
meeting
and
make
a
speech
all
these
demands
upon
his
time
took
him
away
from
the
queen
and
every
absence
made
her
lonely
she
wrote
to
king
leopold
you
can
not
think
how
forlorn
i
am
when
he
is
away
all
the
numerous
children
are
as
nothing
it
seems
as
if
the
whole
light
of
the
house
and
home
were
gone
prince
albert
never
let
a
day
pass
during
any
of
these
absences
without
writing
to
her
once
when
he
went
to
an
important
meeting
of
scientific
men
he
sent
back
the
same
day
a
little
note
that
said
i
have
locked
myself
in
to
send
you
two
lines
as
a
token
of
my
life
and
love
you
will
be
feeling
somewhat
lonely
and
forsaken
among
the
two
and
a
half
millions
of
human
beings
in
london
and
i
too
feel
the
want
of
only
one
person
to
give
a
world
of
life
to
everything
around
me
the
following
day
he
sent
her
another
letter
although
it
could
reach
her
only
two
hours
before
his
own
arrival
however
pressing
his
business
might
be
he
always
found
time
to
write
a
word
to
her
one
of
these
notes
read
your
faithful
husband
agreeably
to
your
wishes
reports
that
he
is
still
alive
that
he
has
discovered
the
north
pole
from
lincoln
cathedral
but
without
finding
either
captain
ross
or
sir
john
franklin
that
he
has
arrived
at
brocklesby
and
received
the
address
that
he
subsequently
rode
out
and
got
home
quite
covered
with
snow
and
with
icicles
on
his
nose
that
the
messenger
is
waiting
to
carry
off
this
letter
which
you
will
have
in
windsor
by
the
morning
last
not
least
in
the
phrase
that
he
loves
his
wife
and
remains
her
devoted
husband
in
the
midst
of
all
these
engagements
the
home
life
and
the
education
of
the
children
were
not
neglected
lord
melbourne
and
baron
stockmar
had
been
consulted
in
regard
to
tutors
and
nursery
arrangements
as
earnestly
as
on
important
political
actions
bishop
davys
lived
so
simply
that
the
queen
could
not
disturb
him
by
a
royal
visit
but
whenever
she
passed
through
peterborough
she
had
her
train
delay
so
that
he
could
come
to
her
and
she
could
talk
with
him
about
the
children
and
have
his
advice
in
regard
to
their
training
and
their
future
lessons
were
important
matters
in
the
royal
family
and
if
the
governess
was
ill
either
the
queen
or
the
prince
heard
the
children
recite
so
that
there
should
be
no
loss
there
is
a
story
that
when
a
clergyman
who
was
hearing
them
say
the
catechism
remarked
your
governess
has
taught
you
very
thoroughly
they
cried
oh
mamma
always
teaches
us
our
catechism
she
was
interested
in
every
detail
of
their
lives
and
when
the
man
who
made
the
clothes
of
the
sailors
on
the
and
made
a
tiny
sailor
suit
for
the
little
prince
of
wales
she
seemed
as
pleased
as
if
one
suit
a
year
was
the
limit
of
the
royal

besides
the
calls
of

and

many
other
responsibilities
fell
upon
the
sovereign
of
england
in
the
latter
part
of
trade
was
very
dull
in
london
and
the
queen
decided
to
give
a
great
fancy
ball
at
buckingham
palace
so
that
sales
might
be
increased
all
the
guests
were
asked
to
come
in
the
costume
of
the
time
of
the
stuarts
and
this
was
so
gay
and
picturesque
that
the
ballroom
must
have
been
a
most
brilliant
sight
the
queen
wore
a
but
it
was
hardly
as
simple
as
one
would
expect
from
those
two
words
for
it
was
glittering
with
gold
and
silver
lace
while
clusters
of
diamonds
flashed
forth
from
bows
of
ribbon
the
front
of
the
dress
opened
to
display
a
stomacher
and
underskirt
made
gorgeous
with
large
emeralds
strings
of
pearls
were
braided
in
with
her
hair
and
upon
her
head
she
wore
a
small
crown
of
diamonds
and
emeralds
her
gloves
and
shoes
were
heavily
embroidered
with
gold
the
costume
of
the
prince
was
a
veritable
rainbow
for
he
was
all
aglow
in
an
orange
coat
with
its
sleeves
turned
up
with
crimson
velvet
breeches
of
crimson
velvet
and
stockings
of
lavender
silk
this
was
not
all
by
any
means
for
there
were
pink
epaulets
pink
satin
bows
gold
lace
a
silver
baldric
and
a
hat
with
long
white
ostrich
feathers
the
queen
and
the
prince
retained
their
seats
while
the
guests
entered
each
one
making
a
low
bow
in
passing
no
one
would
have
thought
a
royal
ball
complete
without
the
duke
and
he
appeared
in
the
dress
of
a
stuart
general
his
scarlet
coat
adorned
with
gold
lace
and
point
lace
and
its
sleeves
slashed
with
white
satin
blue
velvet
trunks
crimson
silk
sash
white
hat
with
blue
plumes
and
gold
lace
wherever
there
was
room
for
it
completed
his
costume
so
much
he
would
concede
to
the
state
ball
but
he
utterly
refused
to
appear
in
the
long
curls
of
the
stuart
period
and
in
spite
of
all
his
gay
trappings
he
was
still
the
stern
old
commander
another
great
ball
given
by
the
lord
mayor
of
london
followed
this
one
and
it
is
no
wonder
that
queen
and
prince
were
glad
to
leave
london
for
a
little
rest
this
time
and
many
other
times
they
went
to
scotland
they
loved
osborne
but
the
prince
was
feeling
the
strain
of
his
intense
work
and
the
physicians
thought
that
the
air
of
the
mountains
would
be
better
for
him
than
that
of
the
sea
therefore
they
went
to
balmoral
a
charming
little
gray
castle
that
they
had
bought
it
stood
on
the
banks
of
the
swiftly
flowing
river
dee
in
the
midst
of
hills
and
forests
the
life
at
balmoral
was
far
more
simple
than
that
of
many
families
of
course
a
cabinet
minister
was
always
in
attendance
and
messengers
with
boxes
of
state
dispatches
were
continually
coming
and
going
but
there
was
much
greater
freedom
than
the
queen
could
enjoy
elsewhere
in
the
early
years
at
balmoral
the
english
court
consisted
of
the
queen
the
prince
their
four
children
the
two
teachers
and
four
other
persons
secretaries
and
ladies
in
attendance
at
balmoral
they
climbed
mountains
searched
for
crystals
and
cairngorms
took
long
walks
through
the
woods
made
little
picnics
far
up
in
the
hills
and
built
a
cairn
or
great
pile
of
stones
each
person
placing
one
in
turn
to
mark
the
new
ownership
of
the
place
at
dinner
the
prince
wore
the
scotch
dress
and
the
queen
often
wore
over
her
shoulder
a
scarf
of
stuart
plaid
while
the
prince
was
out
shooting
in
the
morning
she
frequently
ran
about
among
the
cottages
chatting
easily
and
comfortably
with
the
cottagers
comparing
the
height
and
weight
of
the
latest
royal
baby
with
the
latest
baby
of
the
neighborhood
going
to
the
little
stores
in
the
village
to
buy
dresses
for
poor
people
and
toys
for
their
children
on
sunday
she
went
to
the
kirk
like
a
true
scotchwoman
and
one
day
she
wrote
in
her
journal
enthusiastic
praise
of
mcleod
sermons
because
they
were
so
simple
and
eloquent
she
said
she
was
never
pleased
to
have
a
minister
pay
her
any
special
attention
in
his
sermons
she
liked
to
have
him
look
upon
her
as
only
one
more
of
his
people
but
she
wrote
that
when
mcleod
prayed
for
her
and
the
prince
and
then
said
bless
their
children
it
gave
her
a
lump
in
the
throat
in
their
everyday
life
the
royal
family
were
scotch
when
they
were
in
scotland
the
english
children
of
the
palace
wore
kilts
and
tartans
they
played
in
the
brooks
with
the
scotch
children
of
the
cottages
and
the
princess
royal
of
england
walked
into
a
wasps
nest
and
met
the
same
fate
that
would
have
befallen
any
little
scotch
girl
who
had
done
the
same
thing
a
highland
dancing
master
and
a
fiddler
were
engaged
to
come
to
balmoral
and
teach
the
queen
and
her
court
how
to
dance
scottish
reels
and
strathspeys
one
evening
after
an
early
dinner
the
court
set
off
for
a
drive
to
see
a
scotch
ball
at
a
neighboring
castle
it
must
have
been
a
weird
and
beautiful
sight
the
dancing
floor
was
out
of
doors
and
all
around
it
stood
highlanders
in
their
gay
plaids
holding
blazing
torches
while
seven
pipers
provided
the
music
one
of
the
reels
was
danced
by
eight
highlanders
each
bearing
a
torch
another
interesting
sight
was
the
sword
dance
in
this
two
swords
crossed
were
laid
upon
the
ground
and
the
performer
must
dance
around
them
without
touching
them
as
in
the
case
of
osborne
it
was
soon
apparent
that
the
pretty
little
gray
castle
was
not
large
enough
for
the
queen
housekeeping
every
bed
in
the
house
was
full
wrote
greville
when
he
had
been
spending
a
night
at
balmoral
a
new
house
was
decided
upon
and
when
the
corner
stone
was
laid
there
was
one
of
the
little
family
celebrations
that
were
so
delightful
to
both
queen
and
prince
the
sun
shone
brightly
on
the
stone
as
it
hung
over
the
place
that
it
was
to
occupy
the
servants
of
the
castle
stood
in
a
semicircle
on
one
side
and
the
workmen
behind
them
the
royal
family
and
their
guests
came
out
of
the
house
together
and
took
their
places
on
the
opposite
side
a
clergyman
offered
up
a
prayer
for
a
blessing
on
the
work
and
on
the
new
home
a
parchment
giving
the
date
on
which
the
stone
was
laid
was
signed
by
every
member
of
the
royal
family
and
put
into
a
bottle
together
with
the
current
coins
of
the
country
the
bottle
was
sealed
and
placed
in
the
cavity
the
architect
gave
the
queen
a
trowel
to
spread
the
mortar
and
the
stone
was
lowered
the
queen
then
struck
the
stone
with
a
mallet
and
said
i
now
declare
that
this
corner
stone
is
laid
she
poured
oil
upon
it
in
token
of
plenty
and
wine
in
token
of
gladness
the
pipers
played
the
workmen
had
a
feast
and
a
dance
and
the
new
house
was
begun
when
the
house
was
partly
done
the
builder
came
to
prince
albert
and
said
the
price
of
materials
has
risen
so
greatly
that
keeping
this
contract
will
ruin
me
tell
me
just
what
the
prices
are
now
and
what
they
were
when
we
made
the
contract
said
the
prince
the
builder
made
a
rapid
list
and
gave
it
to
him
a
few
days
later
the
prince
sent
for
the
builder
and
said
i
find
that
you
are
right
and
so
i
have
burned
my
copy
of
the
contract
i
will
be
the
builder
myself
and
if
you
will
superintend
the
work
of
building
i
will
pay
you
the
same
amount
that
you
expected
to
make
on
the
contract
only
a
few
days
after
one
of
the
simple
merry
evenings
at
balmoral
a
telegram
broke
into
the
happiness
of
the
household
saying
that
the
duke
of
wellington
was
dead
one
can
not
think
of
this
country
without
the
duke
wrote
the
queen
not
an
eye
will
be
dry
he
was
pride
her
glory
her
hero
the
greatest
man
she
had
ever
produced
a
public
funeral
was
given
him
by
order
of
parliament
his
body
lay
in
state
in
a
great
hall
whose
walls
were
heavily
draped
with
black
relieved
only
by
the
banners
that
he
had
captured
in
battle
guardsmen
as
motionless
as
statues
stood
at
intervals
along
the
passage
leaning
upon
their
muskets
which
rested
muzzles
down
on
the
door
on
the
coffin
lay
the
duke
sword
and
his
cocked
hat
and
around
the
bier
stood
officers
on
guard
whose
scarlet
uniforms
shone
out
of
the
darkness
in
the
light
of
the
tall
wax
candles
that
outlined
the
bier
finally
the
body
of
the
duke
was
borne
to
paul
on
an
iron
followed
by
the
dead
commander
horse
with
its
empty
saddle
and
by
a
long
line
of
soldiers
representing
every
regiment
thousands
of
people
lined
the
street
through
which
the
funeral
marched
they
stood
with
bared
heads
and
in
such
perfect
silence
that
not
a
sound
was
heard
but
the
steady
tramp
of
feet
and
the
roll
of
the
funeral
drums
so
it
was
that
the
great
soldier
was
buried
amid
the
grief
of
the
nation
never
was
he
needed
more
for
the
sound
of
war
was
coming
near
the
emperor
nicholas
whom
the
queen
had
called
so
easy
to
get
along
with
proved
to
be
somewhat
less
easy
than
he
had
been
when
on
a
visit
he
had
declared
that
he
should
protect
the
christians
in
turkey
from
the
outrages
of
the
turks
but
france
and
england
believed
that
what
he
was
really
aiming
at
was
to
get
possession
of
constantinople
if
he
succeeded
in
this
no
ship
could
enter
the
black
sea
against
his
will
and
it
would
not
be
impossible
for
him
to
gain
control
of
the
asiatic
lands
then
ruled
by
great
britain
if
this
came
to
pass
russia
would
be
far
more
powerful
than
any
other
state
in
europe
this
was
the
belief
of
england
and
france
and
they
wished
to
oppose
him
the
queen
was
always
against
war
but
when
it
was
finally
declared
early
in
she
did
everything
in
her
power
for
the
success
of
england
when
the
first
regiments
that
were
ready
to
go
to
the
crimea
marched
through
the
courtyard
of
buckingham
palace
she
and
the
prince
stood
on
the
balcony
as
enthusiastic
as
the
troops
then
she
hastened
to
osborne
to
say
farewell
to
the
warships
that
were
starting
for
the
baltic
prince
alfred
had
already
made
up
his
mind
to
be
a
sailor
and
the
duke
little
namesake
was
destined
to
follow
the
duke
example
and
be
a
soldier
but
they
were
as
yet
only
small
children
and
the
queen
exclaimed
how
i
wish
i
had
two
sons
in
the
army
now
and
two
in
the
navy
nothing
that
affected
the
war
was
too
great
or
too
small
for
her
to
notice
and
she
had
a
definite
opinion
on
every
subject
your
majesty
said
lord
aberdeen
the
prime
minister
it
is
proposed
to
have
a
day
of
humiliation
and
fasting
for
the
success
of
our
arms
i
approve
most
heartily
of
a
day
of
prayer
declared
the
queen
but
not
of
calling
it
a
day
of
humiliation
we
are
not
humiliated
it
is
not
our
wickedness
but
the
selfish
ambition
and
want
of
honesty
of
the
emperor
which
have
brought
on
this
war
we
believe
that
our
cause
is
just
and
that
we
are
contending
for
what
is
right
but
it
has
long
been
the
custom
to
call
such
days
times
of
fasting
and
prayer
the
prime
minister
suggested
we
will
thank
god
for
the
blessings
we
have
enjoyed
said
the
queen
and
ask
his
help
and
protection
but
it
is
my
particular
wish
that
we
call
the
day
one
of
prayer
and
supplication
the
war
was
begun
and
during
the
two
years
following
no
one
in
the
land
suffered
more
intensely
than
the
queen
a
powerful
nation
is
always
inclined
to
expect
that
its
enemies
may
be
crushed
at
a
blow
but
russia
was
not
so
easily
crushed
the
queen
was
prepared
for
battles
lost
and
battles
won
but
not
for
blunders
and
poor
management
and
to
a
woman
as
prompt
and
as
careful
of
details
as
she
such
faults
were
unpardonable
before
many
months
came
the
report
of
the
charge
of
the
light
brigade
which
tennyson
has
made
famous
in
his
poem
this
useless
charge
by
which
six
hundred
men
were
sent
to
attack
an
army
was
caused
by
a
mistake
someone
had
blundered
thousands
of
copies
of
the
poem
were
printed
and
sent
to
the
soldiers
who
were
besieging
sebastopol
the
queen
was
in
constant
anxiety
telegrams
were
false
and
misleading
and
if
one
brought
good
news
in
the
morning
she
dared
not
rejoice
lest
it
should
be
contradicted
before
night
it
was
then
that
the
work
of
the
special
correspondent
began
for
a
physician
who
was
at
the
scene
of
the
war
sent
letters
to
the
and
for
the
first
time
the
people
at
home
knew
the
daily
life
of
their
soldiers
the
story
told
in
the
columns
of
the
was
a
narration
of
terrible
suffering
which
was
all
the
worse
because
so
much
of
it
was
unnecessary
it
does
not
seem
possible
that
such
stupid
blunders
could
have
been
made
food
was
sent
that
was
not
fit
to
eat
a
whole
shipload
of
shoes
braved
the
storms
of
the
atlantic
and
mediterranean
and
proved
to
be
all
for
the
left
foot
clothes
blankets
and
medicines
in
generous
quantities
lay
in
the
holds
of
english
vessels
off
balaklava
bay
while
men
were
dying
for
the
lack
of
them
shiploads
of
cattle
arrived
at
balaklava
and
instead
of
being
driven
to
the
front
where
there
was
sore
need
of
beef
they
were
killed
at
once
and
then
came
a
long
delay
in
arranging
for
transportation
the
trouble
was
that
it
was
no
one
business
to
transport
the
stores
and
no
one
had
the
right
to
interfere
the
hospitals
were
so
inefficient
that
of
the
men
who
died
perished
of
disease
and
mismanagement
and
not
from
the
bullets
of
the
russians
when
such
news
as
this
reached
england
the
whole
country
was
aroused
but
it
was
helpless
there
was
no
time
to
change
the
organization
of
the
conflicting
departments
and
the
minister
of
war
finally
decided
to
do
exactly
what
the
romans
used
to
do
in
times
of
great
difficulty
he
appointed
a
dictator
with
full
power
to
go
to
the
crimea
and
do
precisely
as
she
thought
best
in
making
arrangements
for
the
sick
and
wounded
soldiers
this
dictator
was
a
woman
named
florence
nightingale
she
had
a
large
fortune
and
a
beautiful
home
but
she
cared
more
for
helping
the
sick
than
for
living
in
luxury
for
more
than
ten
years
she
had
been
studying
nursing
not
only
in
england
but
in
france
and
germany
late
in
she
went
to
the
crimea
taking
nurses
with
her
it
was
no
small
task
that
she
had
undertaken
for
in
a
short
time
ten
thousand
sick
men
were
in
her
charge
the
sanitary
arrangements
of
the
camp
and
the
hospital
were
all
in
her
hands
she
was
a
gentle
modest
woman
by
nature
shy
and
retiring
but
where
the
comfort
of
her
soldiers
was
concerned
she
would
never
yield
a
point
to
anyone
she
had
a
voice
of
velvet
and
a
will
of
steel
they
said
of
her
and
as
she
walked
down
the
long
aisles
of
the
hospitals
in
one
of
them
the
rows
of
beds
stretched
along
for
nearly
two
and
a
half
miles
the
poor
sufferers
kissed
her
very
shadow
it
was
of
her
that
longfellow
wrote
and
slow
as
in
a
dream
of
bliss
the
speechless
sufferer
turns
to
kiss
her
shadow
as
it
falls
upon
the
darkening
walls
meanwhile
the
queen
was
doing
all
in
her
power
for
the
soldiers
and
their
families
a
patriotic
fund
was
begun
and
it
soon
reached
the
soldier
daughter
and
her
older
girls
sewed
and
knit
for
the
army
the
prince
of
wales
who
was
now
thirteen
years
of
age
painted
a
picture
to
be
sold
for
the
fund
no
small
contribution
for
it
brought
nearly
three
hundred
dollars
and
the
two
older
princesses
talked
as
they
sat
knitting
about
miss
nightingale
and
wished
they
could
go
to
the
crimea
and
work
by
her
side
at
the
opening
of
parliament
the
queen
began
her
speech
bravely
but
when
she
spoke
of
the
war
her
failed
her
and
she
struggled
through
the
sentences
as
best
she
could
with
her
eyes
full
of
tears
news
of
victories
came
but
nothing
could
be
decisive
except
the
capture
of
sebastopol
if
we
could
only
take
sebastopol
she
was
always
saying
to
herself
and
one
of
her
children
said
to
a
general
who
was
starting
for
the
crimea
do
hurry
and
take
sebastopol
or
it
will
kill
mamma
in
september
the
royal
family
and
the
duchess
of
kent
were
at
balmoral
when
late
one
evening
on
the
third
day
after
their
arrival
two
telegrams
were
brought
in
one
for
the
queen
and
one
for
the
cabinet
minister
good
news
exclaimed
the
queen
this
tells
the
details
of
the
destruction
of
the
russian
ships
but
i
have
still
better
news
said
the
minister
mine
reads
is
in
the
hands
of
the
allies
come
and
light
the
bonfire
cried
prince
albert
and
he
started
up
craig
gowan
the
hill
opposite
the
house
where
material
for
a
bonfire
had
been
piled
up
nearly
a
year
before
in
the
hope
that
sebastopol
would
fall
before
the
queen
had
to
return
to
london
the
gentlemen
of
the
court
hastened
after
the
prince
in
full
evening
dress
as
they
were
the
little
princes
were
awakened
and
hurriedly
dressed
and
they
followed
after
their
father
the
servants
followed
the
keepers
the
workmen
the
whole
population
of
the
village
the
fires
blazed
out
and
shone
on
all
the
peaks
round
about
the
people
in
the
valleys
knew
what
it
meant
and
they
too
hurried
to
the
top
of
the
hill
there
was
cheering
dancing
shouting
playing
of
bagpipes
and
firing
of
guns
it
was
a
veritable
witches
dance
declared
the
prince
when
he
came
down
he
was
soon
followed
by
the
rest
of
the
people
and
when
they
were
under
the
queen
window
they
sang
to
the
music
of
the
bagpipes
they
fired
guns
and
then
they
cheered
the
queen
the
prince
the
emperor
of
france
and
last
they
gave
a
deafening
nis
nis
nis
hurrah
for
the
fall
of
sebastopol
it
would
seem
as
if
this
was
excitement
enough
for
one
month
but
four
days
later
the
young
prince
frederick
william
of
prussia
came
to
balmoral
to
make
a
visit
and
before
the
visit
had
lasted
two
weeks
there
was
a
pretty
little
scene
on
the
mountain
side
when
he
gave
princess
vicky
a
piece
of
white
heather
the
emblem
of
good
fortune
and
contrived
to
make
it
clear
to
her
that
the
best
fortune
which
could
happen
to
him
would
be
the
gift
of
her
hand
a
few
days
before
this
the
father
and
mother
and
their
guest
had
agreed
that
nothing
should
be
said
to
the
princess
for
six
months
but
the
secret
had
found
its
way
out
the
princess
victoria
had
always
been
baron
stockmar
special
favorite
and
she
as
well
as
her
father
wrote
their
good
friend
at
once
and
sent
him
the
news
that
the
kindly
old
had
been
waiting
for
since
the
princess
was
a
little
child
for
such
a
marriage
would
make
a
strong
alliance
between
england
and
prussia
the
two
great
protestant
powers
of
europe
prince
albert
wrote
the
prince
is
really
in
love
and
the
little
lady
does
her
best
to
please
him
come
to
us
soon
we
have
so
much
to
talk
over
a
little
later
he
wrote
again
of
his
hope
that
he
should
soon
hear
the
children
say
do
you
know
papa
that
the
baron
is
in
his
room
below
he
closed
we
positively
must
have
some
talk
face
to
face
the
princess
was
to
be
confirmed
in
the
spring
and
until
that
event
was
past
nothing
was
to
be
said
in
public
of
the
engagement
the
marriage
was
not
to
take
place
until
at
least
a
year
after
the
confirmation
but
prince
albert
felt
that
the
time
was
far
too
short
for
the
preparation
that
her
future
position
would
make
desirable
and
busy
man
as
he
was
he
set
apart
an
hour
every
evening
to
talk
with
her
on
historical
topics
and
listen
to
the
papers
which
she
prepared
on
subjects
that
he
had
given
her
in
the
spring
came
her
confirmation
which
was
preceded
by
an
examination
in
the
catechism
held
in
the
presence
of
her
father
and
mother
the
duchess
of
kent
and
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
this
betrothal
of
the
eldest
daughter
brought
to
the
queen
mingled
feelings
of
pleasure
and
pain
pleasure
because
the
alliance
with
prussia
so
desirable
an
arrangement
for
both
countries
was
to
be
brought
about
by
a
marriage
that
promised
the
happiness
of
her
daughter
pain
because
that
marriage
was
the
first
break
in
the
family
circle
nevertheless
in
joy
or
in
sorrow
the
public
life
of
the
sovereign
must
go
on
many
of
the
soldiers
who
had
been
severely
wounded
were
sent
home
the
queen
had
often
visited
them
in
the
hospitals
and
one
day
she
said
to
her
minister
those
brave
men
ought
to
have
medals
that
they
can
hand
down
to
their
children
and
i
have
ordered
a
number
to
be
made
as
the
day
appointed
for
the
distribution
of
the
medals
drew
near
the
minister
asked
if
she
would
have
them
sent
to
the
men
no
replied
the
queen
with
decision
i
want
to
put
those
medals
into
their
hands
myself
i
feel
as
if
those
men
were
my
own
children
it
was
a
pitiable
company
of
sufferers
that
she
met
there
were
men
with
deep
red
scars
men
with
empty
sleeves
men
tottering
up
to
her
on
crutches
to
touch
the
hand
of
their
queen
many
of
them
would
not
give
up
their
medals
to
be
marked
with
their
names
lest
they
should
not
receive
again
the
very
ones
that
the
queen
had
given
them
one
man
was
wheeled
up
in
a
chair
he
had
lost
one
leg
and
the
foot
from
the
other
but
he
had
refused
to
give
up
the
command
of
his
battery
till
the
fight
was
over
and
had
given
his
orders
as
calmly
as
if
he
had
not
been
touched
such
bravery
as
that
cried
the
queen
with
tears
in
her
eyes
calls
for
more
than
a
medal
and
you
shall
be
one
of
my
that
pays
me
amply
for
everything
he
replied
the
queen
wrote
the
account
of
this
incident
to
king
leopold
one
must
revere
and
love
such
soldiers
as
those
she
added
she
was
never
weary
of
visiting
the
hospitals
and
camps
as
the
regiments
returned
from
the
crimea
in
the
spring
and
summer
of
there
were
reviews
without
end
on
one
occasion
she
reviewed
eighteen
thousand
troops
she
was
dressed
in
the
uniform
of
a
field
marshal
with
a
dark
blue
skirt
and
as
she
rode
down
the
front
and
returned
by
the
rear
the
thousands
of
men
presented
arms
and
the
bands
of
twenty
regiments
gave
her
a
joyful
greeting
then
she
rode
to
a
little
mound
from
which
she
watched
her
troops
as
they
filed
past
her
there
was
no
limit
to
the
enthusiasm
and
loyalty
which
were
aroused
by
the
presence
of
the
queen
one
review
was
held
in
a
pelting
rain
the
evolutions
were
spoiled
and
the
men
had
every
reason
to
feel
gloomy
and
disappointed
but
the
queen
saved
the
day
for
she
rose
in
her
carriage
and
made
them
a
little
speech
of
welcome
that
was
like
a
flash
of
sunshine
when
she
closed
with
i
thank
god
that
your
dangers
are
over
while
the
glory
of
your
deeds
remains
there
was
a
wild
outburst
of
cheers
the
men
waved
their
hats
their
sabers
anything
and
everything
that
would
wave
and
shouted
till
the
hills
echoed
the
sailors
were
no
less
loyal
during
this
same
summer
there
was
a
superb
naval
review
off
spitshead
which
the
queen
witnessed
from
the
royal
yacht
two
hundred
and
forty
ships
of
war
were
assembled
but
that
was
not
all
for
the
queen
suite
alone
consisted
of
thirty
steamships
and
there
were
many
hundred
private
steamboats
and
sailing
vessels
every
foot
of
the
shore
that
would
give
a
view
of
the
warships
was
crowded
with
spectators
and
they
had
a
sight
well
worth
the
seeing
ships
and
steamers
were
beautifully
decorated
with
flags
and
crowded
with
guests
the
were
drawn
up
in
a
double
line
and
the
royal
yacht
steamed
slowly
along
between
them
every
vessel
manned
its
yards
and
fired
a
royal
salute
as
the
queen
passed
the
most
enthusiastic
cheering
echoed
and
reëchoed
then
came
a
mimic
naval
attack
on
southsea
castle
and
the
brilliant
day
was
at
an
end
one
thing
more
the
queen
planned
to
do
for
her
soldiers
and
that
was
to
give
a
badge
of
special
honor
to
those
who
had
been
especially
distinguished
by
some
deed
of
rare
bravery
this
badge
was
the
victoria
cross
which
was
then
bestowed
for
the
first
time
with
it
went
a
pension
of
fifty
dollars
a
year
more
than
one
hundred
thousand
people
assembled
in
hyde
park
to
see
the
chosen
heroes
receive
their
crosses
the
queen
was
now
in
the
scarlet
jacket
of
the
army
prince
albert
rode
on
one
side
of
her
and
prince
frederick
william
on
the
other
side
she
remained
on
horseback
during
the
whole
ceremony
leaning
forward
as
one
brave
fighter
after
another
was
led
up
to
her
and
pinning
the
cross
on
his
breast
the
woman
whose
battles
had
been
not
with
russians
but
with
mismanagement
and
inefficiency
lingered
in
the
crimea
until
she
had
seen
every
soldier
leave
for
home
then
she
herself
returned
as
quietly
as
if
she
had
been
on
a
pleasure
trip
she
seemed
to
have
entirely
forgotten
that
thousands
of
men
in
england
would
have
been
lying
in
crimean
graves
had
it
not
been
for
her
but
the
men
remembered
and
england
gave
her
such
a
welcome
as
even
the
duke
of
wellington
had
hardly
received
she
was
an
honored
guest
at
balmoral
everyone
was
longing
to
do
something
for
her
but
what
should
it
be
make
her
a
gift
said
the
people
and
let
her
do
with
it
as
she
will
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
dollars
was
raised
by
popular
subscription
and
presented
to
her
she
did
with
it
as
she
would
she
endowed
schools
for
the
training
of
nurses
to
carry
on
the
work
that
she
loved
chapter
x
the
royal
young
people
many
people
had
thought
that
the
russians
hoped
to
get
control
of
india
if
they
had
succeeded
in
doing
so
the
queen
would
have
been
saved
the
sorrow
that
came
to
her
from
a
revolt
of
her
indian
troops
which
was
known
as
the
sepoy
mutiny
the
commanders
of
the
troops
were
english
but
most
of
the
rank
and
file
were
either
mohammedans
or
hindus
the
mohammedans
looked
upon
the
cow
as
sacred
and
the
hindus
regarded
the
hog
as
unclean
therefore
when
cartridges
were
given
them
greased
with
a
mixture
of
tallow
and
lard
the
soldiers
of
both
peoples
were
very
angry
another
trouble
was
that
the
english
government
had
declared
that
no
one
should
lose
his
property
on
account
of
any
change
in
his
religious
belief
and
this
decree
aroused
the
wrath
of
the
native
priests
the
revolt
was
one
of
the
most
fearful
events
known
in
history
for
even
women
and
children
were
murdered
as
brutally
as
if
the
sepoys
had
been
wild
beasts
january
was
the
time
that
had
been
set
for
the
marriage
of
the
princess
royal
and
although
india
was
not
entirely
subdued
the
sepoys
were
so
nearly
under
control
that
england
could
join
heartily
in
the
wedding
rejoicings
buckingham
palace
was
crowded
with
guests
so
many
princes
and
princesses
that
when
they
went
to
the
theater
they
made
as
the
queen
said
a
wonderful
row
of
royalties
macbeth
and
three
other
plays
were
performed
in
honor
of
the
occasion
for
a
week
eighty
or
ninety
persons
sat
at
the
queen
dinner
table
every
day
there
were
operas
dinner
parties
dances
concerts
and
a
great
ball
at
which
one
thousand
guests
were
present
when
the
wedding
gifts
began
to
arrive
the
large
drawing
room
of
the
palace
became
a
veritable
fairyland
as
table
after
table
was
piled
with
presents
fritz
as
the
family
called
prince
frederick
william
had
brought
to
his
bride
a
necklace
of
pearls
which
the
queen
said
were
the
largest
she
had
ever
seen
this
was
only
the
beginning
the
princess
and
her
mother
went
for
a
little
walk
in
the
palace
garden
and
when
they
came
in
there
were
more
tables
and
an
entirely
new
display
of
gifts
they
went
to
their
own
rooms
and
when
they
returned
still
more
gifts
had
arrived
there
were
pictures
candelabra
diamond
and
emerald
bracelets
brooches
necklaces
everything
in
the
shape
of
jewelry
that
can
be
imagined
and
what
especially
pleased
the
housewifely
tastes
of
the
queen
there
were
quantities
of
needlework
from
many
ladies
of
the
kingdom
for
the
princess
was
a
special
favorite
and
rich
and
poor
were
eager
to
send
her
some
token
of
their
love
the
young
girl
was
in
ecstasies
then
she
remembered
that
going
with
fritz
meant
leaving
her
father
and
mother
and
she
burst
into
tears
at
the
end
of
the
festal
week
came
the
wedding
day
the
queen
said
i
felt
as
if
i
were
being
married
over
again
myself
only
much
more
nervous
and
when
just
before
the
ceremony
she
was
daguerreotyped
with
fritz
and
vicky
she
trembled
so
that
her
likeness
was
badly
blurred
early
in
the
morning
the
bells
began
to
ring
but
long
before
their
first
peal
thousands
were
out
in
the
streets
too
excited
to
sleep
or
even
to
remain
in
their
homes
the
procession
was
formed
just
as
it
had
been
eighteen
years
before
at
the
marriage
of
the
queen
and
the
long
line
of
carriages
drove
from
buckingham
palace
to
the
chapel
royal
of
james
trumpets
were
blown
banners
were
waved
and
the
whole
city
reëchoed
with
the
shouts
of
the
merrymakers
the
queen
bowed
to
her
people
as
graciously
as
ever
but
she
could
not
forget
for
a
moment
that
her
oldest
daughter
was
about
to
leave
her
and
she
wrote
afterwards
the
cheering
made
my
heart
sick
within
me
the
procession
was
even
more
beautiful
than
that
on
the
wedding
day
of
the
queen
because
in
this
one
there
were
so
many
children
first
came
the
members
of
the
royal
family
the
duchess
of
kent
nearest
to
the
queen
and
her
children
looking
very
handsome
in
her
gown
of
violet
velvet
trimmed
with
ermine
then
came
the
prime
minister
bearing
the
sword
of
state
he
was
followed
by
bertie
who
was
now
a
tall
young
man
of
sixteen
and
affie
the
sailor
boy
of
fourteen
both
in
highland
costume
everyone
was
looking
for
the
queen
and
she
came
directly
after
her
two
older
sons
she
was
resplendent
in
a
moiré
skirt
of
lilac
and
silver
with
a
long
train
of
lilac
velvet
and
was
all
ablaze
with
diamonds
the
two
little
boys
the
namesake
of
the
duke
of
wellington
and
leopold
who
was
not
yet
five
years
old
walked
one
on
either
side
of
their
mother
they
as
well
as
the
older
boys
were
brilliant
in
stuart
plaid
which
made
a
glowing
contrast
with
the
lilac
velvet
behind
the
queen
walked
hand
in
hand
the
three
royal
girls
alice
who
was
fifteen
and
the
two
younger
ones
helena
and
louise
they
were
in
pink
satin
with
cornflowers
and
marguerites
in
their
hair
the
nine
royal
children
were
present
with
the
exception
of
baby
beatrice
who
was
not
yet
one
year
old
the
queen
and
the
royal
family
took
their
places
in
the
royal
closet
a
room
opening
into
the
chapel
illustration
westminster
abbey
all
the
guests
had
assembled
long
before
the
entrance
of
the
procession
and
now
they
were
all
watching
eagerly
for
the
prince
of
prussia
and
the
princess
royal
of
england
the
prince
in
his
dark
blue
uniform
looked
thoroughly
a
soldier
he
made
a
profound
bow
to
the
queen
knelt
in
prayer
for
a
few
minutes
then
stood
waiting
to
receive
his
bride
after
the
gorgeous
colors
worn
by
those
who
had
preceded
her
the
white
moiré
dress
and
the
wreath
of
orange
blossoms
and
myrtle
made
the
princess
look
very
childlike
she
walked
between
her
father
and
king
leopold
her
train
borne
by
the
eight
young
girls
who
were
her
bridesmaids
they
were
in
white
tulle
with
pink
roses
among
the
roses
were
sprigs
of
white
heather
for
even
in
the
excitement
of
this
wedding
season
the
queen
did
not
forget
her
scottish
home
the
prince
was
much
more
calm
than
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
for
the
clergyman
was
so
nervous
that
he
left
out
some
passages
from
the
marriage
service
at
the
moment
that
the
ring
was
put
on
the
finger
of
the
bride
the
cannon
were
fired
as
at
the
marriage
of
the
queen
but
now
the
people
of
germany
must
not
be
forgotten
and
as
the
first
gun
sounded
a
telegram
was
sent
to
berlin
the
last
words
of
the
service
were
read
the
lord
mercifully
with
his
favor
look
upon
you
and
the
hallelujah
chorus
burst
forth
followed
by
mendelssohn
wedding
march
as
the
bride
and
bridegroom
went
forth
from
the
chapel
hand
in
hand
all
london
was
keeping
holiday
and
throngs
had
gathered
about
buckingham
palace
ready
to
greet
the
returning
party
with
most
tumultuous
applause
the
honeymoon
was
to
be
spent
at
windsor
and
the
eton
boys
who
always
claimed
a
share
in
royal
rejoicings
dragged
the
royal
carriage
from
the
railroad
station
to
the
castle
a
few
days
later
came
the
final
and
these
were
much
harder
than
if
the
bride
had
not
been
of
the
royal
family
for
kings
and
queens
can
make
few
visits
it
was
a
very
tearful
time
a
dreadful
day
wrote
the
queen
i
think
it
will
kill
me
to
take
leave
of
dear
papa
the
bride
had
said
to
her
mother
but
the
moment
of
parting
had
to
come
the
snow
was
falling
fast
but
all
the
way
to
the
wharf
at
gravesend
were
beautiful
decorations
and
crowds
of
people
and
on
the
pier
were
companies
of
young
girls
wearing
wreaths
and
carrying
flowers
to
strew
before
the
feet
of
the
bride
come
back
to
us
if
he
treat
you
well
called
a
voice
from
the
crowd
and
the
steamer
moved
slowly
away
from
the
wharf
prince
albert
watched
it
for
a
few
minutes
then
returned
to
the
queen
who
was
lonely
in
her
great
palace
so
lonely
that
even
the
sight
of
baby
beatrice
made
her
sad
reminding
her
that
only
a
few
hours
before
the
little
one
had
been
in
the
arms
of
the
beloved
eldest
daughter
the
little
lady
does
her
best
to
please
him
prince
albert
had
written
on
the
day
of
the
princess
engagement
but
now
she
had
thousands
of
people
to
please
and
the
father
and
mother
at
home
waited
anxiously
for
letters
and
telegrams
and
reports
of
friends
to
know
what
welcome
the
germans
had
given
to
their
daughter
for
so
much
of
her
future
comfort
among
them
depended
upon
the
first
impression
that
she
made
dear
child
wrote
prince
albert
to
her
i
should
have
so
liked
to
be
in
the
crowd
and
hear
what
the
multitude
said
of
you
he
had
already
received
a
proud
and
jubilant
telegram
from
fritz
the
whole
royal
family
is
enchanted
with
my
wife
the
princess
hohenlohe
the
queen
beloved
wrote
from
berlin
the
enthusiasm
and
interest
shown
are
beyond
everything
never
was
a
princess
in
this
country
received
as
she
is
later
in
the
year
the
royal
father
and
mother
contrived
to
make
a
fortnight
visit
to
germany
and
found
the
princess
frederick
william
quite
the
old
vicky
still
prince
albert
birthday
was
celebrated
during
their
stay
the
children
at
home
were
also
celebrating
it
with
the
duchess
of
kent
they
recited
poems
and
played
their
pieces
of
music
and
exhibited
the
pictures
that
they
had
drawn
several
days
earlier
they
had
all
sent
birthday
letters
to
germany
and
these
letters
were
given
a
prominent
place
on
the
presents
table
the
queen
gift
to
her
husband
was
a
portrait
of
baby
beatrice
done
in
oil
the
princess
did
not
forget
the
scotch
home
that
she
loved
and
among
her
gifts
to
her
father
was
an
iron
chair
for
the
balmoral
garden
the
farewells
had
to
be
said
much
too
soon
then
came
the
return
to
england
and
the
other
children
they
were
growing
up
fast
the
prince
of
wales
was
at
oxford
not
idling
his
time
away
but
working
so
hard
that
the
irrepressible
called
him
a
prince
at
high
pressure
alfred
who
was
now
fourteen
had
just
passed
his
examination
and
received
his
midshipman
appointment
the
examiners
would
have
been
satisfied
with
fifty
correct
answers
but
the
prince
had
presented
eighty
and
when
his
father
and
mother
landed
at
osborne
there
he
stood
on
the
wharf
in
his
naval
cadet
uniform
and
looking
as
happy
as
a
boy
who
was
not
a
prince
would
have
looked
after
coming
out
of
a
examination
with
flying
colors
several
months
earlier
prince
albert
had
watched
him
reef
a
topsail
in
a
strong
breeze
and
said
it
almost
took
his
breath
away
to
see
him
do
all
sorts
of
things
at
that
dizzy
height
the
circle
of
children
soon
began
to
widen
for
early
in
princess
vicky
became
the
mother
of
a
boy
and
the
queen
not
yet
forty
years
of
age
was
a
grandmother
the
child
was
named
frederick
william
victor
albert
ever
since
her
marriage
the
princess
had
kept
up
a
constant
correspondence
with
home
she
wrote
her
mother
every
day
sometimes
twice
a
day
telling
all
the
little
events
of
her
life
to
her
father
she
sent
every
monday
long
letters
on
general
topics
and
he
always
sent
a
reply
two
days
later
no
one
knew
better
than
he
the
difficulties
that
lay
before
her
in
making
her
home
in
a
foreign
country
and
often
his
letters
gave
her
bits
of
advice
that
had
come
from
his
own
experience
sometimes
they
were
little
pictures
of
home
life
once
he
told
her
of
a
splendid
snowman
that
the
children
had
made
with
a
yellow
carrot
for
a
nose
and
an
old
hat
of
affie
on
his
head
after
the
birth
of
frederick
william
victor
albert
the
letters
from
germany
never
forgot
to
tell
the
latest
news
about
the
little
german
baby
and
the
english
letters
quoted
the
sayings
of
baby
beatrice
whom
prince
albert
called
the
most
amusing
baby
we
ever
had
one
day
he
wrote
of
this
little
one
when
she
tumbles
she
calls
out
in
bewilderment
do
like
it
she
do
like
it
she
came
into
breakfast
a
short
time
ago
with
her
eyes
full
of
tears
moaning
has
been
so
naughty
poor
baby
so
naughty
as
one
might
complain
of
being
ill
or
of
having
slept
badly
while
buckingham
palace
had
still
its
merry
group
of
children
the
two
older
sons
bertie
and
affie
were
on
their
way
across
the
ocean
prince
alfred
was
making
a
voyage
to
the
cape
of
good
hope
and
the
prince
of
wales
was
going
to
canada
during
the
crimean
war
the
colony
had
raised
and
equipped
a
regiment
to
aid
the
mother
country
and
had
most
urgently
invited
the
monarch
to
visit
her
lands
in
the
west
but
because
of
the
exposure
and
fatigue
it
was
not
thought
wise
for
her
to
accept
the
invitation
canada
had
then
asked
that
one
of
the
princes
should
be
appointed
governor
they
were
far
too
young
for
any
such
position
but
the
promise
was
made
that
the
prince
of
wales
should
visit
the
colony
in
the
spring
of
it
was
decided
that
he
should
go
early
in
the
autumn
the
prince
was
delighted
with
the
expedition
and
was
ready
to
be
pleased
with
whatever
came
to
hand
in
newfoundland
a
ball
was
given
for
him
and
he
danced
not
only
with
the
ladies
of
the
official
circle
but
with
the
wives
and
daughters
of
the
and
had
the
tact
to
make
himself
liked
by
all
he
had
a
most
dignified
manner
and
bearing
said
the
wife
of
the
archdeacon
god
bless
his
pretty
face
and
send
him
a
good
wife
cried
the
fishermen
his
visit
to
canada
was
not
all
amusement
for
he
had
the
usual
royal
duties
to
perform
he
opened
an
exhibition
laid
the
last
stone
of
the
victoria
bridge
over
the
lawrence
and
laid
the
corner
stone
of
the
new
parliamentary
buildings
at
ottawa
no
fault
could
be
found
with
his
manner
of
attending
to
such
duties
but
he
won
the
hearts
of
the
people
less
by
laying
corner
stones
than
by
such
bits
of
boyishness
as
singing
with
the
band
one
day
when
they
chanced
to
play
some
of
his
favorite
airs
he
saw
blondin
walk
across
niagara
falls
on
a
i
beg
of
you
do
do
that
again
he
said
earnestly
to
the
performer
there
is
really
not
the
least
danger
i
would
willingly
carry
you
over
on
my
back
replied
blondin
but
the
prince
did
not
accept
the
offer
when
buchanan
president
of
the
united
states
heard
that
the
prince
of
wales
was
coming
to
canada
he
wrote
to
the
queen
inviting
the
prince
to
visit
him
at
the
white
house
and
assuring
her
that
her
son
would
receive
a
very
cordial
greeting
from
the
americans
the
city
of
new
york
meant
to
have
a
royal
visit
all
to
herself
and
therefore
sent
a
special
invitation
for
him
to
come
to
that
city
the
united
states
showed
no
lack
of
interest
in
the
young
man
reporters
from
the
leading
american
papers
followed
him
about
in
canada
and
when
he
crossed
to
detroit
he
found
the
whole
city
illuminated
and
the
streets
so
crowded
that
he
had
to
slip
into
his
hotel
by
the
side
entrance
he
visited
the
grave
of
washington
and
planted
a
tree
by
the
tomb
of
the
man
who
had
prevented
him
from
becoming
the
ruler
of
all
north
america
his
visit
to
the
white
house
lasted
for
five
days
and
at
its
close
president
buchanan
wrote
to
the
queen
in
our
domestic
circle
he
has
won
all
hearts
in
new
york
a
ball
was
given
for
him
which
he
enjoyed
but
he
was
far
more
enthusiastic
over
a
parade
of
the
new
york
fire
department
six
thousand
firemen
in
uniform
turned
out
one
evening
all
with
lighted
torches
except
those
who
manned
the
ropes
a
delightful
trait
in
both
his
parents
was
their
feeling
that
honors
shown
them
were
not
merely
actions
due
to
their
position
but
were
marks
of
courtesy
and
kindness
and
the
prince
showed
this
same
characteristic
for
at
the
review
he
cried
with
grateful
delight
it
is
splendid
and
it
all
for
me
every
bit
for
me
on
the
prince
return
voyage
he
was
so
delayed
by
contrary
winds
that
two
warships
were
sent
out
to
search
for
him
he
reached
home
late
in
november
and
on
his
return
a
letter
was
written
to
president
buchanan
by
the
queen
expressing
her
gratitude
for
the
kindness
shown
her
son
and
speaking
very
warmly
of
the
friendship
between
england
and
the
united
states
while
the
prince
of
wales
was
receiving
the
honors
of
the
western
continent
the
midshipman
brother
was
on
his
way
to
south
africa
when
he
landed
at
cape
town
the
english
governor
accompanied
him
on
a
short
tour
through
the
english
possessions
during
which
he
laid
the
first
stone
of
the
famous
breakwater
in
table
bay
he
was
cheered
and
feasted
and
received
with
all
the
honors
that
could
be
devised
so
long
as
he
was
on
land
but
when
he
returned
to
his
vessel
he
was
no
longer
treated
as
a
prince
for
on
shipboard
he
was
simply
a
midshipman
and
in
no
wise
different
from
the
other
naval
cadets
when
the
chief
of
an
african
tribe
came
to
visit
the
ship
he
saw
the
young
prince
and
helping
the
other
midshipmen
to
wash
the
decks
the
chief
went
away
wondering
and
a
little
later
he
and
his
councilors
sent
to
the
english
a
most
interesting
letter
it
read
when
the
son
of
england
great
queen
becomes
subject
to
a
subject
that
he
may
learn
wisdom
when
the
sons
of
england
chiefs
and
nobles
leave
the
homes
and
wealth
of
their
fathers
and
with
their
young
prince
endure
hardships
and
sufferings
in
order
that
they
may
be
wise
and
become
a
defense
to
their
country
when
we
behold
these
things
we
see
why
the
english
are
a
great
and
mighty
nation
when
the
two
brothers
returned
to
england
they
found
that
their
sister
alice
had
followed
the
example
of
the
princess
royal
and
had
become
engaged
the
fortunate
man
was
prince
louis
of
hesse
prince
albert
wrote
to
his
daughter
in
germany
of
the
great
alician
event
saying
alice
and
louis
are
as
happy
as
mortals
can
be
not
long
after
these
cheerful
times
a
deep
sorrow
came
to
the
loving
heart
of
the
queen
in
the
midst
of
the
days
that
were
so
full
of
care
for
her
children
her
home
and
the
duties
of
state
not
only
in
england
but
also
in
africa
and
asia
the
constant
thought
of
the
queen
had
been
her
mother
comfort
when
the
daughter
could
not
be
with
her
mother
letters
were
sent
every
day
and
frequently
several
times
a
day
and
nothing
was
neglected
that
could
add
to
the
duchess
ease
and
happiness
for
some
time
she
had
not
been
well
and
in
the
spring
of
came
the
dreaded
summons
to
her
bedside
in
a
few
hours
she
was
gone
oh
if
only
i
could
have
been
near
her
these
last
weeks
wrote
the
queen
to
king
leopold
save
the
sovereign
herself
there
was
no
woman
in
england
whose
death
would
have
affected
the
whole
country
so
deeply
statesmen
recalled
the
days
when
the
duchess
of
kent
was
left
alone
in
a
strange
land
without
means
disliked
by
the
reigning
king
and
weighed
down
by
the
responsibility
of
educating
a
child
to
stand
at
the
head
of
the
nation
in
the
character
of
their
sovereign
they
saw
proof
of
the
able
devoted
conscientious
manner
in
which
this
sacred
duty
had
been
performed
and
the
address
of
sympathy
sent
by
parliament
to
the
sorrowing
queen
was
as
sincere
as
if
it
had
been
written
by
a
personal
friend
and
not
by
a
body
of
lawmakers
it
is
a
great
sorrow
to
me
not
to
have
féodore
with
me
now
wrote
the
queen
to
king
leopold
but
neither
he
nor
the
princess
hohenlohe
was
able
to
be
present
at
the
last
services
i
can
not
imagine
life
without
her
said
the
queen
sadly
but
nevertheless
life
had
to
go
on
others
may
sometimes
stop
to
mourn
but
the
duties
of
a
sovereign
may
not
be
neglected
even
for
sorrow
a
new
cause
of
anxiety
had
arisen
that
came
nearer
home
than
even
the
sufferings
of
the
crimean
soldiers
war
had
broken
out
in
the
united
states
and
the
supply
of
cotton
to
england
was
rapidly
diminishing
if
the
cotton
supply
failed
entirely
the
mills
of
england
would
have
to
stop
many
thousands
of
spinners
and
weavers
would
have
no
work
and
the
sufferings
of
the
manufacturing
districts
would
be
intense
the
government
made
an
earnest
effort
to
increase
the
amount
of
cotton
imported
to
england
from
india
but
the
emergency
was
so
sudden
that
even
during
the
first
few
months
of
the
war
there
were
many
honest
people
in
england
who
were
sorely
in
need
when
autumn
came
the
queen
was
free
to
go
for
a
little
while
to
the
beloved
balmoral
for
the
rest
and
quiet
which
she
so
greatly
needed
the
simple
life
of
the
highlands
did
more
for
her
than
anything
else
could
have
done
on
this
visit
prince
albert
the
queen
the
princess
alice
prince
louis
of
hesse
with
lady
churchill
and
general
grey
in
attendance
went
on
two
of
what
the
queen
called
great
expeditions
that
is
trips
of
two
or
three
days
by
carriage
and
by
pony
to
the
queen
these
trips
were
as
fascinating
as
they
were
novel
the
party
tried
to
keep
their
identity
a
secret
and
sometimes
they
succeeded
prince
albert
and
the
queen
called
themselves
and
the
real
lady
churchill
was
now
and
general
grey
became
they
were
as
excited
as
children
in
a
new
game
over
playing
their
parts
properly
and
the
struggles
of
the
two
to
remember
not
to
say
your
majesty
and
your
royal
highness
amused
them
immensely
the
lady
must
be
terrible
rich
whispered
an
woman
to
one
of
the
servants
for
she
has
so
many
gold
rings
on
her
fingers
and
you
have
many
more
than
i
said
the
aggrieved
monarch
to
lady
churchill
two
or
three
times
they
stayed
all
night
at
little
village
inns
the
queen
wrote
in
her
journal
that
at
one
of
them
the
bedroom
given
to
her
and
the
prince
was
hardly
more
than
large
enough
for
the
bed
but
she
found
no
fault
with
it
and
called
it
very
clean
and
neat
the
dinner
was
nice
clean
and
good
according
to
her
description
for
this
sovereign
of
great
britain
with
several
magnificent
palaces
of
her
own
was
so
ready
to
be
pleased
with
what
was
done
for
her
that
she
could
be
contented
in
the
tiny
inn
of
a
highland
village
at
a
second
inn
which
seems
to
have
been
particularly
poor
she
admits
that
there
was
hardly
anything
to
eat
but
closes
her
account
less
like
the
ruler
of
millions
than
like
a
half
amused
and
half
disappointed
little
schoolgirl
no
pudding
and
no
fun
we
soon
retired
the
efforts
to
avoid
being
found
out
were
like
a
continual
frolic
the
royal
party
trembled
when
they
heard
the
distant
sound
of
a
drum
and
fife
but
felt
safe
again
on
being
told
by
a
little
maid
at
the
inn
that
it
was
just
a
band
that
walked
about
twice
a
week
sometimes
they
came
to
tiny
villages
where
they
were
suspected
and
at
last
on
getting
up
one
morning
they
heard
the
tread
of
somewhat
irregular
marching
led
by
a
drum
and
fife
and
bagpipe
there
was
no
escape
then
for
they
were
found
out
at
last
a
company
of
volunteers
was
drawn
up
in
front
of
the
door
to
do
them
honor
the
women
of
the
village
stood
by
with
bunches
of
flowers
in
their
hands
and
the
landlady
was
glorified
by
a
black
satin
dress
with
white
ribbons
and
orange
blossoms
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
bow
with
all
gratitude
and
drive
away
as
fast
as
possible
such
a
woman
was
victoria
of
england
ready
to
be
pleased
with
the
smallest
things
praising
what
was
good
saying
little
of
what
was
not
good
and
enjoying
every
little
pleasure
with
a
childlike
zest
and
simplicity
and
yet
this
gentle
little
lady
understood
so
perfectly
her
rights
and
duties
as
monarch
of
great
britain
that
when
her
secretary
of
foreign
affairs
persisted
in
being
quite
too
independent
in
his
methods
of
transacting
business
she
did
not
hesitate
to
write
to
him
the
following
very
definite
sentences
the
queen
thinks
it
right
in
order
to
prevent
any
mistake
for
the
future
to
explain
what
it
is
she
expects
from
the
foreign
secretary
she
requires
that
he
will
distinctly
state
what
he
proposes
in
a
given
case
in
order
that
the
queen
may
know
as
distinctly
to
what
she
has
given
her
royal
sanction
having
once
given
her
sanction
to
a
measure
that
it
be
not
arbitrarily
altered
or
modified
by
the
minister
she
expects
to
be
kept
informed
of
what
passes
between
him
and
the
foreign
ministers
before
important
decisions
are
taken
based
upon
that
intercourse
to
receive
the
foreign
dispatches
in
good
time
and
to
have
the
drafts
for
her
approval
sent
to
her
in
sufficient
time
to
make
herself
acquainted
with
their
contents
before
they
must
be
sent
off
it
is
worth
noting
that
the
royal
lady
who
wrote
this
epistle
had
sufficient
to
delay
for
five
months
forwarding
it
to
the
offending
secretary
hoping
that
his
methods
would
be
amended
and
that
so
severe
a
rebuke
would
become
unnecessary
chapter
xi
the
queen
in
sorrow
it
had
certainly
become
clear
to
all
her
ministers
that
victoria
was
no
mere
figurehead
for
while
she
yielded
if
their
judgment
was
against
her
yet
she
never
failed
to
have
an
opinion
and
a
reason
for
her
opinion
in
the
fact
that
both
she
and
prince
albert
were
able
to
think
for
themselves
and
had
come
to
a
wise
conclusion
proved
to
be
a
matter
of
the
utmost
importance
to
two
countries
england
and
the
united
states
everyone
in
england
was
thinking
about
the
war
in
america
the
english
government
had
declared
that
england
would
be
neutral
that
is
it
would
do
nothing
to
assist
either
the
united
states
or
the
seceded
states
the
united
states
government
was
indignant
at
this
declaration
because
it
spoke
of
the
seceded
or
confederate
states
not
as
if
they
were
rebelling
against
the
government
but
as
if
they
were
an
independent
power
the
confederate
states
however
were
much
pleased
and
thought
it
quite
possible
that
england
might
be
persuaded
to
help
them
their
chief
argument
was
cotton
these
states
were
the
ones
that
raised
cotton
and
with
the
united
states
warships
blockading
their
ports
there
would
be
little
chance
for
cotton
to
reach
england
would
not
england
then
help
the
seceders
put
an
end
to
the
war
and
have
all
the
cotton
that
her
mills
wished
to
use
the
confederates
decided
to
send
two
men
named
mason
and
slidell
across
the
ocean
for
aid
the
first
to
england
the
second
to
france
it
was
not
easy
to
get
away
from
a
southern
port
but
they
contrived
to
escape
to
havana
and
from
there
they
went
on
board
a
british
mail
steamer
named
the
they
supposed
that
all
difficulties
were
over
when
they
were
once
on
board
a
british
vessel
but
before
the
had
been
out
hours
a
united
states
warship
fired
a
shot
across
her
bows
the
was
not
armed
so
that
she
could
make
any
resistance
therefore
she
stopped
and
lieutenant
fairfax
was
sent
aboard
with
a
strong
guard
of
marines
my
orders
from
captain
wilkes
are
to
ask
to
see
the
list
of
your
passengers
he
said
that
list
can
not
be
shown
was
the
reply
of
the
english
captain
i
am
here
to
arrest
mason
and
slidell
lieutenant
fairfax
stated
but
the
captain
only
bowed
it
is
well
known
to
the
united
states
authorities
that
they
are
attempting
to
make
their
way
to
europe
as
envoys
from
states
in
rebellion
against
the
government
said
the
lieutenant
and
therefore
i
demand
their
surrender
then
commodore
williams
who
was
in
charge
of
the
mail
said
indignantly
the
two
gentlemen
are
passengers
in
a
british
vessel
which
is
carrying
the
mail
from
one
neutral
port
to
another
on
board
this
ship
i
represent
her
majesty
government
this
thing
is
an
outrage
and
i
tell
you
that
you
and
your
north
shall
suffer
for
it
does
your
captain
wilkes
do
this
on
his
own
responsibility
or
on
that
of
your
government
on
his
own
was
the
reply
it
is
an
insult
to
england
and
a
violation
of
international
law
declared
the
commodore
but
nevertheless
the
men
were
seized
and
carried
to
boston
when
the
news
of
this
action
reached
england
there
was
wild
excitement
troops
were
sent
to
canada
at
once
the
canadian
harbors
were
frozen
and
england
had
to
ask
permission
of
the
united
states
to
land
them
at
portland
maine
permission
was
granted
and
no
one
seemed
to
see
how
amusing
such
a
request
was
thousands
of
englishmen
were
ready
to
declare
war
upon
the
united
states
without
a
moment
delay
fortunately
governments
move
more
slowly
than
individuals
and
war
could
not
be
declared
without
first
asking
whether
the
united
states
had
given
authority
for
the
seizure
or
approved
of
it
wife
and
daughter
had
gone
on
to
england
in
the
and
they
said
captain
wilkes
did
not
claim
to
have
any
government
authority
and
that
the
united
states
would
probably
set
the
envoys
free
as
soon
as
they
reached
washington
the
prime
minister
did
not
believe
such
would
be
the
result
and
he
wrote
a
somewhat
curt
demand
to
the
united
states
for
an
apology
and
the
freedom
of
the
two
men
neither
the
queen
nor
the
prince
consort
for
that
title
had
been
granted
to
prince
albert
long
before
was
satisfied
with
this
paper
and
the
following
morning
he
wrote
a
statement
to
be
sent
to
the
prime
minister
to
the
effect
that
the
paper
ought
to
mention
the
friendship
between
the
two
countries
and
the
hope
and
expectation
of
england
that
the
united
states
would
say
the
seizure
was
not
done
by
government
authority
prince
albert
and
the
queen
read
the
statement
over
together
she
made
two
or
three
small
changes
in
the
wording
then
copied
it
and
sent
it
to
the
prime
minister
he
admitted
at
once
that
the
queen
and
the
prince
were
in
the
right
and
wrote
another
dispatch
to
send
to
the
united
states
saying
of
course
that
an
apology
and
the
surrender
of
the
men
were
expected
but
wording
the
demand
in
a
most
courteous
and
friendly
manner
in
the
united
states
as
soon
as
president
lincoln
heard
of
the
capture
he
said
this
wo
do
captain
wilkes
is
exercising
the
of
search
and
we
fought
england
in
on
that
very
ground
those
men
must
be
given
up
there
were
thousands
however
who
were
so
excited
that
they
were
ready
to
fight
anybody
for
anything
or
for
nothing
and
if
the
prime
minister
first
dispatch
had
been
sent
it
would
have
been
hard
to
prevent
hostilities
but
in
so
moderate
a
request
for
fairness
even
the
most
could
find
little
excuse
for
demanding
a
declaration
of
war
so
it
was
that
prince
albert
and
the
queen
saved
the
two
countries
from
bloodshed
and
if
the
prince
had
done
nothing
else
in
his
years
of
acting
as
chief
adviser
to
the
queen
that
one
act
would
have
been
glory
enough
but
when
one
remembers
the
vast
number
of
matters
which
he
had
to
consider
it
does
not
seem
as
if
one
man
mind
could
have
held
them
all
laying
corner
stones
unveiling
statues
presiding
over
learned
societies
guiding
the
education
of
his
children
planning
palaces
and
managing
large
estates
all
this
was
but
a
small
part
of
his
labors
he
carried
out
reforms
in
the
navy
he
studied
on
commercial
treaties
between
england
and
other
countries
he
reorganized
the
army
he
wrote
on
improved
methods
of
agriculture
he
constructed
better
national
defenses
he
kept
himself
well
informed
concerning
the
condition
of
the
united
states
india
south
africa
and
every
country
of
europe
after
years
of
such
intense
work
as
this
it
is
no
wonder
that
he
was
exhausted
he
rarely
spoke
of
his
weariness
but
here
and
there
in
his
letters
and
in
his
conversation
with
the
queen
a
word
was
dropped
that
showed
how
weak
and
tired
he
felt
he
slept
little
yet
he
never
thought
of
sparing
himself
and
he
wrote
the
letter
about
the
affair
with
a
very
feeble
hand
i
could
hardly
hold
my
pen
while
writing
he
told
the
queen
and
at
last
he
admitted
that
he
was
thoroughly
miserable
then
came
day
after
day
of
illness
sometimes
the
prince
would
listen
to
his
wife
or
his
daughter
alice
while
they
read
him
one
of
novels
once
he
asked
for
music
a
long
way
off
and
a
piano
was
brought
into
another
room
so
that
the
princess
alice
could
play
his
favorite
sometimes
he
was
confused
and
recognized
no
one
we
are
much
alarmed
said
the
physicians
but
we
do
not
give
up
hope
every
day
found
him
a
little
weaker
and
soon
the
evening
came
when
as
the
queen
bent
over
him
and
whispered
it
is
your
own
little
wife
he
could
not
speak
he
could
only
bow
his
head
and
kiss
her
and
in
a
little
while
he
was
gone
at
midnight
the
mournful
tolling
of
the
great
bell
of
paul
spread
the
sorrowful
news
through
the
city
of
london
and
the
telegraph
told
the
children
of
the
royal
family
who
were
away
from
england
of
the
loss
that
had
befallen
them
the
princess
victoria
was
not
alone
for
her
husband
and
her
child
were
with
her
to
give
her
comfort
but
far
away
in
the
warm
climate
of
cannes
was
prince
leopold
the
delicate
little
boy
of
only
eight
years
with
not
one
of
his
own
family
beside
him
the
child
was
already
grieving
sorely
over
the
death
of
the
gentleman
in
whose
charge
he
had
been
when
the
telegraph
brought
the
news
of
his
crushing
loss
oh
mamma
mamma
he
cried
do
take
me
to
mamma
i
want
my
mother
i
want
my
mother
the
warmest
sympathy
was
felt
for
the
sorrowing
queen
in
her
own
land
and
in
all
lands
even
from
some
chiefs
in
new
zealand
came
an
address
which
began
oh
victoria
our
mother
we
greet
you
all
we
can
now
do
is
to
weep
with
you
oh
our
good
mother
who
have
nourished
us
your
ignorant
children
of
this
island
even
to
this
day
every
honor
that
could
be
shown
was
given
to
the
dead
prince
consort
the
queen
chose
a
sunny
spot
at
frogmore
for
the
beautiful
mausoleum
that
was
to
be
built
for
the
body
of
the
one
who
had
been
dearest
to
her
of
all
the
world
seven
years
earlier
she
had
said
trials
we
must
have
but
what
are
they
if
we
are
together
but
now
the
time
had
come
when
she
must
bear
alone
whatever
might
befall
her
her
greatest
comforter
was
the
princess
alice
the
girl
of
eighteen
who
seemed
no
longer
a
merry
young
girl
but
a
sympathetic
woman
she
and
the
other
children
went
with
the
queen
to
osborne
and
there
passed
the
first
three
months
of
the
lonely
woman
sorrow
king
leopold
and
the
princess
of
hohenlohe
came
to
her
but
the
weight
of
her
grief
was
hers
alone
and
no
one
could
lessen
it
crushed
as
she
was
by
suffering
she
did
not
cease
to
feel
for
others
within
a
month
after
the
death
of
the
prince
a
terrible
colliery
accident
occurred
by
which
many
lives
were
lost
and
the
queen
sent
at
once
a
generous
gift
and
the
message
tell
them
that
the
queen
own
misery
only
makes
her
feel
the
more
for
them
in
her
own
heartbreak
she
could
not
neglect
the
state
business
whose
delay
would
cause
many
difficulties
but
she
could
not
bear
to
meet
others
than
her
children
and
a
few
of
her
nearest
friends
again
it
was
the
princess
alice
upon
whom
she
and
the
whole
country
relied
and
this
girl
of
eighteen
went
back
and
forth
between
the
sovereign
and
the
ministers
with
such
strength
of
mind
such
thoughtfulness
and
tact
that
the
whole
realm
was
amazed
and
grateful
it
would
have
been
a
comfort
to
the
loving
mother
if
she
could
have
kept
her
oldest
son
with
her
during
those
sad
months
but
even
to
lessen
her
loneliness
she
would
not
break
in
upon
the
plans
that
his
father
had
made
for
him
it
had
been
decided
that
he
should
travel
in
the
holy
land
and
not
many
weeks
after
the
death
of
the
prince
he
set
out
with
dean
stanley
and
others
for
the
east
illustration
balmoral
castle
it
had
long
been
the
custom
in
the
royal
family
to
spend
at
balmoral
the
queen
birthday
in
may
and
the
birthday
of
the
prince
in
august
and
even
during
this
sad
year
of
the
usual
may
visit
was
made
hard
as
it
was
for
the
queen
to
go
without
the
prince
to
a
place
that
had
been
so
dear
to
him
there
was
comfort
for
her
in
going
among
the
cottagers
she
loved
the
scotch
because
while
they
had
a
profound
respect
for
her
they
had
also
respect
for
themselves
and
would
talk
with
her
without
the
subservience
that
she
disliked
she
taught
her
scotch
tenants
to
look
upon
her
as
a
friend
to
whom
they
might
come
for
help
in
time
of
trouble
in
sickness
they
were
encouraged
to
send
to
the
castle
for
whatever
they
needed
when
the
queen
went
to
london
she
did
not
forget
them
and
whenever
a
marriage
or
a
death
or
the
arrival
of
a
new
baby
occurred
among
her
balmoral
people
it
was
reported
to
her
at
once
during
the
last
visit
of
the
prince
consort
to
balmoral
the
husband
of
one
of
the
cottagers
was
very
ill
and
the
queen
was
continually
sending
him
delicacies
from
her
own
table
and
not
always
by
the
hands
of
servants
for
the
princess
louise
was
often
her
messenger
the
story
is
told
of
the
young
girl
taking
some
dainty
from
one
of
the
pockets
of
her
jacket
and
asking
ca
he
eat
this
and
then
when
the
wife
shook
her
head
sadly
of
her
taking
something
else
from
another
pocket
and
saying
surely
he
can
eat
this
the
husband
died
and
when
the
queen
arrived
at
balmoral
on
this
first
visit
without
the
prince
she
went
at
once
to
see
the
widow
both
women
burst
into
tears
i
ask
your
pardon
said
the
cottager
humbly
i
ought
not
to
cry
in
your
presence
oh
it
does
me
good
replied
the
queen
in
the
midst
of
her
own
tears
i
am
so
thankful
to
cry
with
someone
who
knows
just
how
i
feel
it
was
all
so
sudden
so
sudden
this
visit
to
balmoral
was
in
may
and
in
july
the
queen
gave
away
her
chief
comforter
for
she
did
not
think
it
right
to
allow
the
marriage
of
the
princess
alice
to
be
postponed
longer
many
preparations
for
it
had
already
been
made
before
the
illness
of
the
prince
the
highlanders
were
all
interested
in
the
marriage
for
the
princess
alice
was
a
great
favorite
among
them
and
in
the
autumn
of
many
wedding
gifts
had
been
made
by
the
princess
to
the
cottagers
for
in
the
queen
family
it
was
the
custom
to
make
presents
as
well
as
receive
them
at
the
wedding
seasons
the
marriage
took
place
at
osborne
the
day
which
all
had
expected
to
be
so
bright
and
happy
was
sad
and
lonely
for
the
want
of
the
dead
prince
there
was
no
rejoicing
for
everything
was
so
associated
with
him
that
no
one
could
be
merry
even
the
wedding
dress
of
the
bride
was
of
lace
whose
pattern
he
himself
had
chosen
in
a
few
days
prince
louis
and
the
princess
alice
left
england
for
their
german
home
according
to
what
had
become
a
custom
among
the
queen
children
the
princess
wrote
to
her
mother
almost
every
day
her
life
in
darmstadt
was
far
more
simple
than
the
queen
had
been
immediately
after
her
marriage
the
usual
time
of
rising
was
seven
or
a
little
earlier
coffee
was
drunk
at
eight
and
generally
the
next
two
hours
were
spent
out
of
doors
in
riding
or
walking
from
ten
to
twelve
the
princess
wrote
or
worked
with
her
private
secretary
and
some
time
in
the
morning
she
read
the
newspapers
an
occupation
which
she
called
a
great
bore
breakfast
took
the
time
between
twelve
and
one
at
two
people
began
to
come
to
call
upon
her
dinner
was
at
four
after
dinner
came
a
little
leisure
then
a
drive
somewhere
for
tea
by
ten
the
day
was
over
the
princess
lamented
that
she
had
so
little
time
for
her
music
and
drawing
and
when
she
was
away
from
the
city
she
made
many
sketches
but
she
was
in
a
wooded
country
and
the
trees
are
my
misfortune
she
said
as
i
draw
them
so
badly
after
a
few
months
the
brother
arthur
went
to
visit
her
he
was
a
bit
of
home
and
she
was
delighted
to
have
him
he
has
won
all
hearts
she
wrote
to
the
queen
and
i
am
so
proud
when
they
admire
my
little
brother
when
september
came
the
princess
and
her
husband
went
to
thuringia
to
meet
the
queen
and
there
much
to
the
queen
pleasure
it
was
decided
that
her
daughter
and
prince
louis
should
spend
the
winter
in
england
though
the
princess
with
her
ready
sympathy
wrote
that
she
should
regret
not
remaining
in
germany
for
the
one
reason
that
the
people
would
feel
her
absence
so
much
they
are
most
kind
she
added
for
she
shared
the
feeling
of
her
mother
that
the
devotion
of
the
people
was
not
a
thing
that
they
could
demand
but
was
a
personal
kindness
shown
to
them
on
this
visit
to
the
continent
queen
victoria
spent
a
few
days
in
belgium
with
king
leopold
and
while
she
was
with
him
a
young
girl
was
invited
to
be
his
guest
whom
she
was
especially
desirous
of
meeting
her
name
was
alexandra
and
she
was
the
eldest
daughter
of
the
heir
to
the
throne
of
denmark
she
had
grown
up
in
the
quaint
old
palace
in
copenhagen
within
hearing
of
the
murmur
of
the
sea
when
summer
came
she
was
taken
to
a
delightful
house
in
the
woods
where
she
had
dogs
and
ponies
and
flowers
and
long
walks
through
the
forest
and
when
friends
came
from
the
town
there
were
picnics
and
boating
and
all
sorts
of
good
times
indeed
every
day
was
a
kind
of
picnic
for
in
the
country
home
the
family
almost
lived
out
of
doors
and
there
were
always
her
two
brothers
and
three
sisters
for
company
the
life
of
the
children
was
merry
and
happy
but
it
was
even
more
simple
than
that
of
the
little
girl
who
went
from
kensington
to
the
throne
of
england
both
because
the
father
and
mother
believed
that
it
was
best
for
children
to
live
simply
and
also
because
especially
during
the
children
earlier
years
there
was
not
much
money
to
throw
away
in
luxuries
the
little
girls
put
on
their
nicer
dresses
which
perhaps
their
mother
had
made
when
they
were
going
out
but
as
soon
as
they
came
back
and
were
ready
to
play
the
street
dresses
were
exchanged
for
something
more
substantial
the
children
had
learned
when
they
were
very
young
that
they
could
not
have
everything
they
wanted
and
that
they
must
be
obedient
and
helpful
and
punctual
if
they
were
not
ready
for
a
meal
or
for
their
lessons
they
were
often
sent
to
their
rooms
as
a
punishment
those
rooms
had
to
be
in
perfect
order
for
each
daughter
was
required
to
take
care
of
her
own
as
they
grew
older
they
were
taught
to
do
many
things
for
themselves
if
one
of
them
wanted
a
new
dress
and
her
rather
slender
allowance
would
not
pay
the
dressmaker
she
knew
how
to
make
it
for
herself
and
if
a
new
hat
was
wanted
she
could
trim
it
this
was
the
way
in
which
the
young
girl
had
grown
up
who
was
going
to
visit
the
queen
of
great
britain
when
her
first
year
of
sorrow
was
drawing
to
its
close
this
was
no
ordinary
visit
for
several
persons
were
very
anxious
that
the
queen
should
like
the
princess
they
need
not
have
feared
everyone
who
met
alexandra
loved
her
for
this
bright
cheerful
young
girl
carried
sunshine
wherever
she
went
and
it
shone
upon
even
the
lonely
heart
of
the
sorrowful
queen
there
had
been
a
great
deal
of
discussion
about
who
would
be
the
bride
of
the
prince
of
wales
and
not
a
little
scheming
among
no
lesser
people
than
some
of
the
great
dignitaries
of
europe
for
there
were
several
young
princesses
whose
parents
would
have
been
glad
to
form
an
alliance
with
the
heir
of
england
crown
but
while
the
schemers
were
scheming
the
prince
was
forming
a
very
definite
opinion
of
his
own
at
the
home
of
his
the
duchess
of
cambridge
he
saw
one
day
a
portrait
of
a
very
beautiful
young
girl
and
who
is
that
he
asked
his
cousin
the
princess
mary
that
alix
was
the
reply
and
she
is
the
dearest
girl
in
all
the
world
you
know
that
grandfather
left
his
palace

is
the
prettiest
and
sweetest
and
dearest
of
us

her
for
she
came
to
visit
me
when
she
was
ten
years
old
and
she
went
to
a
children
party
at
buckingham
palace
boys
of
twelve
do
not
always
remember
little
girls
of
ten
the
prince
of
wales
did
not
say
whether
he
had
forgotten
alix
or
not
but
while
in
the
officials
were
talking
about
several
other
european
princesses
as
well
as
the
princess
alexandra
he
was
making
it
clear
to
his
father
and
mother
that
was
the
one
whom
he
wished
to
see
princess
vicky
always
had
her
own
opinions
and
she
too
had
been
charmed
by
the
lovely
danish
princess
come
and
visit
me
and
you
shall
see
her
she
wrote
the
prince
went
to
germany
the
princess
was
on
her
way
to
rumpenheim
and
nothing
was
easier
than
to
arrange
a
meeting
prince
albert
wrote
the
young
people
seem
to
have
a
warm
liking
for
each
other
some
months
after
the
death
of
prince
albert
the
two
met
again
next
followed
the
little
visit
to
queen
victoria
and
the
loving
welcome
to
the
young
girl
who
then
became
the
betrothed
of
the
prince
of
wales
denmark
was
delighted
and
england
was
no
less
happy
prince
christian
soon
carried
his
daughter
to
london
to
visit
queen
victoria
and
then
came
a
busy
time
for
all
the
wedding
trousseau
except
the
lingerie
was
to
come
from
england
princess
mary
was
delighted
to
help
in
selecting
and
probably
the
prince
of
wales
had
now
and
then
a
word
to
say
while
this
was
going
on
in
england
scores
of
women
in
denmark
were
cutting
and
stitching
the
finest
of
linen
and
embroidering
on
every
article
a
crown
and
the
initials
of
their
beloved
princess
the
whole
land
subscribed
to
give
her
a
generous
dowry
and
then
the
wedding
presents
began
to
come
there
were
many
of
great
value
of
course
for
all
the
courts
of
europe
were
interested
in
the
marriage
but
the
princess
cared
most
for
the
gifts
that
came
from
her
own
people
who
knew
her
and
loved
her
among
those
tokens
there
was
a
painting
of
her
brothers
and
sisters
in
a
group
a
pair
of
shoes
embroidered
in
gold
from
the
shoemakers
of
copenhagen
and
some
vases
from
the
villagers
who
lived
near
the
summer
home
in
the
forest
the
danish
king
gave
her
a
necklace
of
diamonds
and
pearls
and
king
leopold
sent
her
a
most
beautiful
dress
of
brussels
lace
at
the
end
of
the
last
sermon
that
she
heard
in
her
own
church
the
pastor
who
had
known
her
from
babyhood
gave
her
a
loving
benediction
and
farewell
the
wedding
was
to
be
in
england
and
in
february
of
the
young
bride
with
her
father
and
mother
and
brothers
and
sisters
went
aboard
the
royal
train
the
queen
had
sent
to
antwerp
her
own
and
the
yacht
that
had
so
often
carried
happy
people
and
after
a
few
days
rest
at
king
leopold
court
the
party
crossed
the
channel
with
a
little
squadron
of
british
as
escort
as
they
neared
the
english
coast
the
water
swarmed
with
every
kind
of
vessel
that
would
float
from
a
steamship
to
a
rowboat
for
everyone
was
eager
to
see
the
young
girl
whose
beauty
had
been
heralded
throughout
the
kingdom
there
was
one
boat
which
had
the
right
of
way
and
soon
the
prince
of
wales
was
meeting
his
bride
and
giving
her
a
hearty
kiss
that
satisfied
even
the
hundreds
of
spectators
her
dress
would
seem
exceedingly
quaint
but
it
must
have
been
wonderfully
becoming
it
was
of
mauve
poplin
made
very
full
for
those
were
the
days
of
over
it
she
wore
a
long
purple
velvet
cloak
with
a
border
of
sable
and
her
lovely
face
was
framed
in
a
white
poke
bonnet
trimmed
with
rosebuds
as
soon
as
she
had
landed
the
difficulties
began
for
the
people
who
had
been
waiting
for
hours
to
see
the
face
that
they
had
heard
was
the
prettiest
in
the
world
meant
to
see
it
and
they
thronged
about
her
carriage
in
such
determined
crowds
that
the
police
were
helpless
there
is
a
story
that
one
inquisitive
youth
actually
twisted
his
head
between
the
spokes
of
her
carriage
wheels
to
get
a
glimpse
of
her
in
some
way
and
the
legend
says
that
the
princess
herself
helped
him
out
of
his
dangerous
position
addresses
were
presented
before
she
had
fairly
set
her
feet
upon
english
soil
one
of
them
signed
by
the
eight
hundred
eton
boys
whenever
there
was
a
moment
delay
some
delegation
was
always
waiting
ready
to
make
a
speech
of
welcome
there
were
rockets
and
bonfires
and
salutes
from
vessels
and
forts
and
fascinated
as
she
was
the
young
girl
was
thoroughly
tired
before
she
was
safe
at
windsor
castle
a
week
later
the
royal
wedding
was
celebrated
in
george
chapel
the
prince
was
in
the
long
flowing
purple
velvet
mantle
of
the
order
of
the
garter
which
made
a
rich
contrast
with
the
white
lace
and
satin
and
orange
blossoms
of
his
bride
she
was
loaded
with
jewels
for
the
gifts
of
the
queen
the
prince
and
the
city
of
london
must
all
be
treated
with
respect
in
her
bouquet
were
sprigs
of
myrtle
that
had
a
history
for
they
had
come
from
a
bush
grown
from
the
myrtle
in
the
bridal
bouquet
of
the
princess
vicky
there
was
more
jewelry
that
was
of
special
interest
for
while
the
prince
was
satisfied
with
a
plain
hoop
of
gold
for
the
wedding
ring
the
guard
was
set
with
stones
the
initials
of
whose
names
formed
the
word
bertie
beryl
emerald
ruby
turquoise
jacinth
emerald
the
lockets
that
he
gave
to
the
bridesmaids
were
made
after
a
new
fashion
for
they
were
wrought
of
crystal
and
in
each
were
the
initials
a
a
intertwined
in
a
design
drawn
by
the
princess
alice
these
letters
were
made
of
diamonds
and
coral
to
display
the
red
and
white
of
the
danish
flag
there
was
all
the
brilliancy
and
gorgeousness
that
can
be
imagined
for
it
was
the
wedding
of
the
heir
to
the
british
crown
there
were
heralds
drummers
and
trumpeters
all
in
quaint
and
handsome
costumes
the
gleam
of
gold
the
flash
of
diamonds
and
the
burning
glow
of
rubies
made
the
chapel
a
wilderness
of
color
and
brightness
very
slowly
the
beautiful
princess
and
her
bridesmaids
moved
up
the
long
aisle
to
the
altar
too
slowly
for
the
comfort
of
prince
arthur
and
his
brother
leopold
in
their
highland
dress
for
the
small
german
nephew
had
been
put
under
their
care
and
the
naughty
little
frederick
william
victor
albert
bit
their
bare
legs
whenever
they
told
him
to
be
quiet
the
whole
floor
of
the
chapel
was
radiant
with
beauty
and
aglow
with
happiness
but
in
the
closet
up
above
the
heads
of
the
joyous
throng
stood
the
queen
of
england
in
the
deepest
mourning
glad
in
the
gladness
of
her
eldest
son
and
in
her
love
for
the
maiden
who
was
his
choice
but
with
the
sorrow
at
her
heart
that
forbade
her
to
share
in
the
rejoicings
of
her
people
chapter
xii
the
little
folk
in
the
midst
of
all
the
royalties
that
were
present
at
the
wedding
of
the
prince
of
wales
were
the
two
great
novelists
of
the
realm
thackeray
and
dickens
but
tennyson
the
poet
laureate
was
not
there
again
someone
had
blundered
and
his
invitation
had
been
missent
both
the
queen
and
prince
albert
felt
a
sincere
admiration
and
reverence
for
the
poet
and
the
prince
had
asked
the
favor
of
an
autograph
with
far
more
hesitation
than
most
schoolboys
would
have
shown
this
is
the
way
in
which
he
made
his
very
modest
petition
will
you
forgive
me
if
i
intrude
upon
your
leisure
with
a
request
which
i
have
thought
some
little
time
of
making
that
you
would
be
good
enough
to
write
your
name
in
the
accompanying
volume
of
the
of
the
king
prince
albert
was
very
fond
of
the
idylls
and
when
only
a
month
after
his
death
tennyson
brought
out
a
new
edition
of
the
poems
it
contained
a
beautiful
dedication
which
began
these
to
his
memory
since
he
held
them
dear
the
lines
do
not
sound
as
if
the
poet
felt
obliged
to
write
them
because
he
had
been
appointed
laureate
but
rather
as
if
he
meant
every
word
that
he
wrote
in
this
dedication
he
speaks
very
earnestly
of
prince
albert
wisdom
and
ability
and
unselfishness
and
gives
us
the
exquisite
line
which
everyone
quotes
who
writes
of
the
prince
consort
wearing
the
white
flower
of
a
blameless
life
the
following
year
just
before
the
wedding
of
the
prince
of
wales
tennyson
wrote
a
welcome
to
the
bride
beginning
daughter
from
over
the
sea
alexandra
saxon
and
norman
and
dane
are
we
but
all
of
us
danes
in
our
welcome
of
thee
alexandra
the
queen
was
much
pleased
with
the
poem
and
said
thank
him
very
warmly
and
tell
him
with
how
much
pleasure
i
have
read
the
lines
and
that
i
rejoice
the
sweet
and
charming
bride
should
be
thus
greeted
there
is
a
story
that
when
the
danish
princess
was
a
very
young
girl
she
and
three
of
her
girl
friends
sat
together
in
the
forest
talking
of
what
they
should
like
to
do
when
they
were
grown
up
i
want
to
be
famous
said
one
i
want
to
paint
a
picture
that
everyone
will
go
to
see
or
to
write
a
book
that
all
denmark
will
be
eager
to
read
if
i
could
do
just
what
i
liked
declared
the
second
i
would
travel
all
over
the
world
so
i
will
wish
to
be
a
great
traveler
i
want
to
be
rich
said
the
third
and
then
i
can
travel
whenever
i
choose
and
buy
all
the
books
i
choose
without
having
to
write
them
and
all
the
pictures
i
choose
without
having
to
paint
them
but
what
do
you
want
alix
the
princess
alix
had
been
thinking
and
she
answered
slowly
if
i
could
have
just
what
i
wanted
i
would
choose
that
everyone
who
saw
me
should
love
me
however
it
was
with
the
others
the
princess
alexandra
surely
had
her
wish
for
everyone
who
met
her
seemed
to
love
her
the
queen
called
her
the
fairy
and
so
great
a
dignitary
as
dean
stanley
thought
of
her
in
the
same
way
for
after
he
had
had
a
long
talk
with
her
in
the
corner
of
the
drawing
room
telling
her
how
the
service
of
the
church
of
england
differed
from
that
of
the
danish
church
he
wrote
in
his
diary
she
is
as
charming
and
beautiful
a
creature
as
ever
passed
through
a
fairy
tale
the
little
gem
of
denmark
is
the
pet
of
the
country
declared
the
newspapers
the
unbounded
admiration
that
had
been
shown
to
queen
victoria
in
the
early
days
of
her
reign
was
given
to
alexandra
when
the
queen
came
to
the
throne
young
girls
who
were
small
and
had
fair
hair
and
blue
eyes
were
happy
it
was
bliss
to
have
any
feature
that
resembled
the
danish
princess
she
had
a
custom
of
letting
two
curls
of
brown
hair
fall
on
each
shoulder
and
straightway
english
fashions
demanded
that
every
girl
should
wear
four
curls
hanging
on
her
shoulders
for
months
london
was
at
the
height
of
gayety
the
princess
represented
her
royal
at
the
drawing
rooms
of
the
season
no
easy
task
for
so
many
ladies
attended
the
first
that
it
took
four
long
hours
for
them
to
pass
the
throne
all
this
time
the
princess
alexandra
and
the
princess
alice
stood
to
receive
them
except
for
one
little
resting
time
of
twenty
minutes
there
were
receptions
and
most
magnificent
balls
at
which
all
the
dignitaries
tried
their
best
to
make
themselves
agreeable
to
the
young
princess
of
course
the
queen
had
no
heart
for
these
festivities
but
she
was
glad
to
have
the
people
pleased
and
for
one
of
the
most
elaborate
entertainments
she
sent
decorations
and
furnishings
from
buckingham
palace
the
princess
alice
and
prince
louis
were
with
her
for
several
months
before
the
marriage
of
the
prince
of
wales
and
only
three
or
four
weeks
after
the
great
event
a
little
hessian
granddaughter
was
born
at
windsor
castle
the
chaplain
of
the
hessian
court
came
to
england
for
the
christening
of
the
wee
maiden
the
usual
number
of
names
was
given
her
but
the
first
two
were
victoria
alberta
in
the
autumn
the
queen
made
the
customary
visit
to
balmoral
but
only
a
few
days
after
her
arrival
she
took
an
evening
drive
that
put
her
into
a
great
deal
of
danger
for
the
carriage
turned
over
and
the
queen
the
princess
alice
and
lenchen
as
the
princess
helena
was
called
were
thrown
out
brown
the
queen
favorite
highland
attendant
had
little
regard
for
court
manners
at
any
time
and
less
than
ever
in
this
predicament
he
called
out
the
lord
almighty
have
mercy
on
us
who
did
ever
see
the
like
of
this
before
i
thought
you
were
all
killed
the
queen
had
fallen
on
her
face
and
was
somewhat
bruised
princess
alice
with
her
usual
calmness
held
a
lantern
so
that
the
men
could
see
to
cut
the
horses
free
then
while
the
driver
went
for
help
the
monarch
of
great
britain
sat
in
the
road
wrapped
up
in
plaids
and
using
the
floor
of
the
carriage
for
a
back
the
princess
had
brought
her
page
along
a
malay
boy
whose
father
had
presented
him
to
a
traveler
in
return
for
some
kindness
and
little
willem
sat
in
front
with
one
lantern
while
brown
held
another
it
was
a
strange
situation
a
queen
with
thousands
of
soldiers
at
her
command
sitting
in
a
broken
carriage
waiting
for
horses
and
guarded
by
one
highlander
and
a
little
black
boy
she
wrote
in
her
journal
for
that
day
people
were
foolishly
alarmed
when
we
got
upstairs
and
made
a
great
fuss
had
my
head
bandaged
and
got
to
bed
rather
late
this
soldier
daughter
could
make
little
of
pain
but
she
could
not
so
easily
put
away
sorrow
every
place
about
balmoral
reminded
her
of
something
that
prince
albert
had
said
or
done
and
she
could
not
bear
that
his
presence
should
be
forgotten
on
the
summit
of
a
hill
which
they
had
often
visited
together
she
built
a
great
cairn
on
which
was
inscribed
to
the
beloved
memory
of
albert
the
great
and
good
prince
consort
raised
by
his
widow
victoria
she
was
touched
and
grateful
when
the
citizens
of
aberdeen
wished
to
put
up
a
statue
of
the
prince
and
asked
her
to
be
present
at
the
unveiling
it
was
nearly
two
years
since
his
death
but
she
had
not
yet
taken
part
in
any
public
ceremony
and
she
dreaded
to
have
the
morning
come
when
it
did
come
however
she
wrote
in
her
journal
the
words
that
were
the
keynote
of
her
courage
in
meeting
difficulties
prayed
for
help
and
got
up
earlier
the
rain
poured
but
the
streets
of
aberdeen
were
thronged
with
people
out
of
sympathy
with
her
grief
there
was
no
cheering
and
no
band
playing
for
more
than
years
she
had
never
appeared
on
public
occasions
without
both
cheering
and
music
and
although
she
appreciated
the
thoughtful
sympathy
of
the
people
the
silence
only
made
the
contrast
greater
between
the
past
and
the
present
the
exercises
began
with
an
address
to
the
queen
by
the
lord
provost
she
handed
him
a
written
reply
then
he
knelt
before
her
her
minister
gave
her
a
sword
and
touching
the
provost
with
it
on
each
shoulder
she
said
rise
sir
alexander
anderson
anderson
had
now
become
a
knight
and
would
be
called
sir
alexander
all
the
rest
of
his
life
after
this
little
ceremony
the
bunting
was
drawn
away
from
the
statue
and
what
the
queen
called
a
fearful
ordeal
was
at
an
end
the
one
upon
whom
the
queen
depended
most
was
princess
alice
she
often
went
on
little
picnics
or
drives
because
alice
advised
the
princess
and
prince
louis
spent
as
much
time
in
england
as
possible
and
when
they
were
in
germany
the
letters
of
the
princess
gave
her
mother
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
they
were
full
of
the
details
of
her
daily
life
some
of
which
might
have
come
from
a
palace
and
some
from
a
cottage
one
described
a
gift
just
received
from
the
empress
of
russia
a
splendid
bracelet
and
a
few
days
later
the
young
mother
wrote
exultantly
that
the
baby
looked
about
and
laughed
this
young
housekeeper
was
deeply
interested
in
all
the
details
of
her
home
she
was
grateful
to
her
queen
mother
for
the
big
turkey
pie
and
the
other
good
things
that
arrived
at
christmas
time
and
she
wrote
of
her
various
little
dilemmas
ranging
all
the
way
from
a
hunt
for
a
pen
just
after
a
journey
to
the
whirl
of
making
the
dining
room
into
a
bedroom
to
accommodate
a
guest
one
morning
she
wrote
in
the
midst
of
household
troubles
as
she
said
for
the
emperor
and
empress
had
just
sent
word
that
they
were
coming
to
breakfast
with
her
and
louis
was
out
but
of
all
the
bits
of
home
life
in
her
letters
those
about
the
children
for
in
a
year
and
a
half
there
was
also
a
little
elizabeth
must
have
given
the
most
pleasure
to
the
royal
grandmamma
on
one
page
the
princess
described
some
political
complication
between
kingdoms
and
on
the
next
was
the
astounding
news
that
little
victoria
could
get
on
her
feet
by
the
help
of
a
chair
and
could
push
it
across
the
room
before
long
she
was
walking
out
with
her
father
before
breakfast
with
her
independent
little
hands
in
her
jacket
pockets
money
was
not
especially
plenty
in
the
home
at
darmstadt
and
the
princess
mother
wrote
at
one
time
of
the
little
elizabeth
wearing
victoria
last
year
gowns
and
at
another
said
that
she
had
just
made
seven
little
dresses
for
the
children
with
a
german
father
and
an
english
mother
the
little
victoria
spoke
at
first
a
comical
combination
of
german
and
english
and
she
announced
one
day
meine
grossmama
die
königin
has
got
a
little
vatch
with
a
birdie
there
was
also
a
little
boy
in
england
who
was
taking
much
of
the
queen
attention
the
baby
son
of
the
prince
of
wales
he
was
born
at
frogmore
house
and
as
all
the
clothes
provided
for
him
were
at
marlborough
he
fared
no
better
for
raiment
at
first
than
if
he
had
been
born
in
a
cottage
the
loss
was
made
up
to
him
however
when
he
was
christened
for
then
he
was
gorgeous
in
a
robe
of
honiton
lace
the
same
one
in
which
his
father
had
been
christened
while
over
the
robe
was
a
cloak
of
crimson
velvet
with
a
lining
of
ermine
nothing
could
be
too
rich
and
costly
for
some
day
if
he
lived
long
enough
he
would
wear
the
english
crown
one
matter
in
which
the
royal
family
were
most
economical
was
in
regard
to
names
for
they
used
the
same
ones
over
and
over
this
little
boy
was
named
albert
for
his
english
grandfather
victor
for
the
queen
christian
for
his
danish
grandfather
and
edward
for
his
father
princess
alix
was
as
eager
to
be
with
her
precious
baby
as
the
queen
had
been
to
stay
with
her
children
and
she
looked
like
a
mischievous
child
when
she
had
succeeded
in
slipping
away
from
some
grand
company
long
enough
to
give
baby
eddie
his
bath
and
put
him
to
bed
the
little
princess
beatrice
was
scarcely
more
than
a
baby
herself
but
she
seems
to
have
felt
all
the
responsibility
of
being
aunt
to
so
many
small
people
when
she
was
hardly
more
than
three
years
old
princess
vicky
second
child
was
born
and
then
prince
albert
wrote
of
the
little
girl
to
his
eldest
daughter
that
excellent
lady
has
now
not
a
moment
to
spare
have
no
time
she
says
when
she
is
asked
for
anything
must
write
letters
to
my
niece
around
her
and
across
the
channel
were
children
in
whom
she
was
most
warmly
interested
but
the
queen
own
childhood
was
rapidly
growing
more
distant
not
only
by
the
passing
of
time
but
also
by
the
death
of
those
who
were
most
closely
associated
with
her
early
days
bishop
davys
died
in
and
in
the
death
of
king
leopold
occurred
he
was
well
called
the
wisest
king
in
europe
and
more
than
one
dispute
between
kingdoms
had
been
left
to
him
for
settlement
he
knew
all
the
royal
secrets
and
he
made
a
judicious
and
kindly
use
of
his
knowledge
ever
since
the
queen
accession
he
had
aided
her
with
his
counsel
and
now
there
was
no
one
to
whom
she
could
look
for
disinterested
advice
in
that
same
year
the
assassination
of
president
lincoln
occurred
the
queen
was
not
satisfied
with
a
formal
telegram
of
regret
she
wrote
a
letter
not
as
the
sovereign
of
england
to
the
wife
of
the
president
but
as
one
sorrowing
woman
to
another
expressing
her
warm
sympathy
few
people
realized
how
much
severe
mental
labor
the
queen
had
to
endure
often
in
the
course
of
a
single
year
many
thousand
papers
were
presented
to
her
and
of
these
there
were
few
to
which
she
did
not
have
to
give
close
thought
for
years
she
had
discussed
everything
with
prince
albert
and
when
they
had
come
to
a
conclusion
he
would
as
in
the
affair
write
whatever
was
necessary
then
they
would
read
the
paper
together
and
make
any
changes
that
seemed
best
after
his
death
the
queen
had
to
do
all
this
work
alone
she
could
wear
the
kohinoor
diamond
and
she
could
build
a
palace
if
she
chose
but
there
were
few
persons
in
the
kingdom
who
worked
harder
than
she
what
belonged
strictly
to
matters
of
state
was
more
than
enough
for
one
person
but
besides
this
there
were
schools
hospitals
and
bazaars
to
open
prizes
to
distribute
and
to
lay
then
there
were
entertainments
fêtes
receptions
balls
frequently
in
behalf
of
some
good
object
whose
success
was
sure
if
it
could
be
said
that
the
queen
would
be
present
the
prince
and
princess
of
wales
could
not
lessen
the
weight
of
the
public
business
that
pressed
so
heavily
upon
the
queen
but
they
could
relieve
her
from
the
strain
of
these
public
appearances
and
this
they
did
they
were
both
beloved
by
the
people
but
after
the
queen
had
lived
for
five
years
in
retirement
some
of
her
subjects
began
to
complain
what
has
she
to
do
grumbled
one
but
to
wear
handsome
clothes
live
in
a
palace
and
bow
to
people
when
she
drives
out
yes
declared
another
she
has
nothing
to
do
parliament
makes
the
laws
and
she
just
writes
her
name
she
good
to
her
cottagers
in
the
highlands
said
a
londoner
but
she
ought
to
care
a
little
for
the
merchants
here
in
london
everybody
likes
the
princess
but
the
queen
the
queen
and
there
never
were
such
sales
as
when
she
was
giving
her
balls
she
thinks
of
nothing
but
her
own
sorrow
said
another
she
has
lost
all
sympathy
with
the
people
this
last
speech
was
made
at
a
public
meeting
john
bright
the
great
peace
statesman
was
present
and
he
replied
to
it
his
closing
words
were
a
woman
who
can
keep
alive
in
her
heart
a
great
sorrow
for
the
lost
object
of
her
life
and
affection
is
not
at
all
likely
to
be
wanting
in
a
great
and
generous
sympathy
for
you
little
by
little
the
queen
learned
the
feelings
of
her
people
and
she
soon
published
a
response
which
must
have
made
the
grumblers
feel
ashamed
she
said
she
was
grateful
for
their
wish
to
see
her
but
so
much
was
now
thrown
upon
her
which
no
one
else
could
do
that
she
was
overwhelmed
with
care
and
anxiety
and
did
not
dare
to
undertake
mere
representation
lest
she
should
become
unable
to
fulfill
the
duties
which
were
of
real
importance
to
the
nation
some
months
later
she
wrote
of
herself
in
a
private
letter
from
the
hour
she
gets
out
of
bed
till
she
gets
into
it
again
there
is
work
work
work
questions
which
are
dreadfully
exhausting
the
queen
wished
sincerely
not
only
to
do
what
was
best
for
the
people
but
also
to
please
them
she
could
not
go
to
balls
and
theaters
but
early
in
she
determined
to
open
parliament
in
person
the
london
world
rejoiced
they
tried
to
imagine
that
the
old
days
had
come
again
and
they
put
on
their
jewels
and
their
most
splendid
robes
all
the
way
to
the
parliament
building
the
streets
were
full
of
crowds
who
shouted
long
live
the
queen
hurrah
for
the
queen
in
the
house
of
lords
there
was
a
most
brilliant
assembly
silks
rustled
and
jewels
sparkled
as
all
rose
to
welcome
the
sovereign
as
she
entered
the
prince
of
wales
stepped
forward
and
led
her
to
the
throne
the
royal
parliamentary
robes
with
all
their
glitter
of
gold
and
glow
of
crimson
were
laid
upon
it
for
the
queen
wore
only
mourning
hues
a
robe
of
deep
purple
velvet
trimmed
with
white
miniver
on
her
head
was
a
marie
stuart
cap
of
white
lace
with
a
white
gauze
veil
flowing
behind
the
blue
ribbon
of
the
garter
was
crossed
over
her
breast
and
around
her
neck
was
a
collar
of
diamonds
all
the
radiant
look
of
happiness
with
which
those
were
familiar
who
had
seen
her
on
the
throne
before
was
gone
she
was
quiet
and
but
grave
and
sad
instead
of
reading
her
speech
she
gave
it
to
the
lord
chamberlain
at
its
close
she
stepped
down
from
the
throne
kissed
the
prince
of
wales
and
walked
slowly
from
the
room
illustration
houses
of
parliament
the
queen
two
daughters
helena
and
louise
had
attended
her
in
opening
parliament
this
must
have
been
a
little
embarrassing
for
the
older
one
inasmuch
as
the
queen
address
declared
that
the
royal
permission
had
been
given
for
the
princess
helena
to
marry
prince
christian
of
but
members
of
the
royal
family
can
not
always
consult
their
own
feelings
when
they
rule
different
countries
it
is
not
always
easy
for
them
even
to
remain
friendly
the
fact
that
the
queen
her
daughters
and
her
danish
were
as
fond
of
one
another
at
the
end
of
as
they
were
at
the
beginning
of
is
proof
that
the
english
royal
family
were
very
harmonious
trouble
had
arisen
between
denmark
and
the
german
states
in
regard
to
the
duchies
of
and
in
war
had
broken
out
between
the
little
kingdom
of
denmark
and
the
united
powers
of
prussia
and
austria
both
countries
were
anxious
to
win
the
help
of
england
princess
vicky
and
princess
alice
naturally
sympathized
with
the
german
states
while
princess
alexandra
affection
was
of
course
with
her
own
home
land
which
had
now
become
her
father
kingdom
the
emperor
of
france
did
not
wish
to
have
the
german
states
increase
in
power
and
he
was
ready
to
help
denmark
provided
england
would
stand
by
him
england
was
willing
but
england
sovereign
would
not
hear
to
any
talk
of
war
with
germany
and
the
ministers
hesitated
to
act
against
her
decided
opposition
of
course
the
danish
princess
was
grieved
that
the
queen
would
not
consent
to
help
her
beloved
country
bismarck
was
the
german
statesman
who
was
pushing
on
the
war
therefore
he
was
the
man
who
was
most
abhorrent
to
the
princess
of
wales
there
is
a
story
that
the
queen
had
promised
the
little
beatrice
a
present
and
that
when
she
asked
what
shall
it
be
the
wee
maiden
who
had
been
carefully
tutored
by
her
replied
demurely
please
mamma
i
like
the
head
of
bismarck
on
a
charger
two
years
later
there
was
a
still
more
difficult
condition
of
affairs
in
the
queen
family
for
now
that
prussia
and
austria
held
the
duchies
it
was
a
question
to
which
of
the
two
powers
they
should
belong
and
to
complicate
matters
even
more
princess
helena
had
married
prince
christian
prussia
and
the
north
german
states
held
together
and
austria
joined
the
forces
of
the
south
german
states
prince
fritz
belonged
to
the
north
and
prince
louis
to
the
south
and
therefore
the
husbands
of
the
two
english
princesses
were
obliged
to
fight
on
opposite
sides
the
war
lasted
for
only
seven
weeks
but
it
was
an
anxious
time
for
queen
victoria
who
shared
so
fully
in
the
troubles
of
her
daughters
princess
alice
two
little
girls
were
sent
to
england
to
be
safe
in
her
care
but
in
the
midst
of
the
war
a
third
little
daughter
was
born
the
boom
of
the
distant
guns
was
heard
as
she
lay
in
her
cradle
in
darmstadt
wounded
men
were
being
brought
into
the
town
and
the
residents
were
fleeing
in
all
directions
by
and
by
the
end
came
and
then
the
little
baby
was
named
irene
or
peace
never
before
had
a
child
so
many
godfathers
for
when
prince
louis
said
farewell
to
his
cavalry
he
delighted
them
by
asking
the
two
regiments
officers
and
men
to
be
sponsors
to
his
little
girl
chapter
xiii
mother
and
empress
while
the
german
wars
were
going
on
the
queen
was
thinking
for
her
country
as
a
sovereign
and
feeling
for
her
children
as
a
mother
in
the
midst
of
all
the
claims
upon
her
she
had
one
aim
that
she
never
forgot
and
that
was
to
make
her
country
understand
and
appreciate
the
talents
and
character
of
prince
albert
she
concluded
to
have
a
book
prepared
that
should
tell
the
story
of
his
life
for
she
felt
that
no
one
who
really
knew
him
could
fail
to
honor
him
when
the
first
volume
was
published
even
her
children
were
surprised
that
she
should
tell
matters
of
her
own
private
life
so
fully
but
she
loved
and
trusted
her
people
and
she
was
as
frank
with
them
as
she
would
have
been
with
an
intimate
friend
the
year
after
this
book
was
brought
out
the
queen
herself
became
the
author
of
a
book
our
life
in
the
highlands
it
is
made
up
of
extracts
from
the
journal
which
she
always
kept
simple
records
she
calls
them
but
they
often
give
charming
pictures
of
the
merry
times
at
balmoral
sir
arthur
helps
aided
her
in
preparing
the
book
for
the
press
he
often
scolds
me
she
said
because
i
am
careless
in
writing
but
how
could
he
expect
me
to
take
pains
when
i
wrote
late
at
night
suffering
from
headache
and
exhaustion
and
in
dreadful
haste
she
arranged
to
have
sir
theodore
martin
complete
the
life
of
the
prince
and
she
spent
much
time
in
arranging
her
husband
papers
and
letters
for
him
to
use
she
generally
chose
the
selections
to
be
inserted
and
she
read
every
chapter
as
it
was
written
about
her
own
authorship
the
queen
was
very
modest
and
when
she
sent
a
copy
of
her
book
to
dickens
she
wrote
in
it
from
the
humblest
of
writers
to
one
of
the
greatest
at
sir
walter
scott
home
she
was
asked
to
write
her
name
in
his
journal
and
although
she
granted
the
request
she
wrote
in
her
own
journal
i
felt
it
a
presumption
in
me
when
carlyle
met
her
he
said
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
a
politer
little
woman
nothing
the
least
imperious
all
gentle
all
sincere
makes
you
feel
too
if
you
have
any
sense
in
you
that
she
is
queen
her
being
queen
gave
her
a
peculiar
power
over
the
marriages
of
her
children
for
they
were
not
legal
unless
she
gave
her
formal
consent
early
in
she
was
called
upon
again
to
exercise
her
right
for
far
up
in
the
hills
about
balmoral
there
was
a
momentous
little
interview
between
the
princess
louise
and
the
marquis
of
lorne
princess
louise
is
so
bright
and
jolly
to
talk
with
one
of
the
scotch
boys
had
said
of
her
when
she
was
a
very
young
girl
and
this
scotch
marquis
was
of
exactly
the
same
opinion
the
queen
had
guessed
before
how
matters
stood
with
her
daughter
and
the
gentleman
whom
she
had
once
called
such
a
merry
independent
child
the
young
man
had
proved
his
independence
by
asking
for
the
hand
of
the
princess
inasmuch
as
it
was
three
hundred
years
since
a
member
of
the
royal
family
had
married
a
subject
but
the
queen
paid
no
attention
to
tradition
she
felt
sure
that
the
marquis
would
make
her
daughter
happy
and
that
was
enough
most
of
her
subjects
agreed
with
her
and
one
of
the
newspapers
said
jubilantly
the
old
dragon
tradition
was
routed
by
a
young
sorcerer
called
love
the
wedding
was
celebrated
at
windsor
it
was
a
brilliant
scene
of
course
and
if
all
the
gentlemen
were
arrayed
as
vividly
as
the
duke
of
argyll
the
father
of
the
bridegroom
the
ladies
did
not
monopolize
gorgeousness
of
attire
the
duke
was
a
scottish
chieftain
and
he
appeared
in
highland
dress
his
kilt
and
the
plaid
thrown
over
his
shoulders
were
of
the
gay
campbell
tartan
his
claymore
a
broad
sword
was
at
his
side
and
in
front
there
hung
from
his
belt
a
sporran
or
deep
pouch
made
of
skin
with
the
hair
or
fur
on
the
outside
his
dirk
sparkled
with
jewels
altogether
he
might
have
stepped
out
of
some
resplendent
assemblage
of
the
middle
ages
after
the
wedding
breakfast
the
bride
laid
aside
her
white
satin
and
honiton
lace
and
arrayed
herself
in
a
traveling
dress
of
campbell
plaid
the
carriage
door
was
closed
and
the
young
couple
drove
away
for
claremont
in
a
little
shower
of
white
slippers
accompanied
according
to
highland
tradition
by
a
new
broom
which
was
sure
to
bring
happiness
to
the
new
household
the
queen
daughters
were
now
in
homes
of
their
own
except
the
princess
beatrice
a
merry
little
girl
of
fourteen
who
had
been
radiantly
happy
in
her
new
pink
satin
at
her
sister
wedding
the
queen
was
devoted
to
her
children
but
it
would
have
been
easier
for
her
to
pass
through
the
next
few
years
if
she
had
been
all
sovereign
and
not
woman
war
broke
out
between
france
and
germany
and
both
prince
fritz
and
prince
louis
were
in
the
field
anxious
as
she
was
for
them
she
was
even
more
troubled
for
the
princess
alice
who
was
really
in
quite
as
much
danger
as
if
she
had
been
in
the
army
for
several
years
she
had
been
deeply
interested
in
lessening
the
sufferings
of
the
poor
in
times
of
illness
and
in
providing
trained
nurses
for
wounded
soldiers
while
this
war
was
in
progress
she
not
only
went
to
the
hospitals
daily
but
she
brought
the
wounded
men
to
her
own
house
and
cared
for
them
herself
she
was
exposed
over
and
over
again
to
typhus
fever
and
other
diseases
but
she
seemed
to
be
entirely
without
fear
one
of
her
friends
describes
seeing
her
help
to
lift
a
soldier
who
was
very
ill
of
smallpox
princess
alice
little
thought
of
what
value
her
skill
in
nursing
would
be
to
her
own
family
but
near
the
end
of
the
prince
of
wales
was
taken
ill
with
typhoid
fever
and
her
help
was
of
the
utmost
value
it
was
just
ten
years
before
that
prince
albert
had
died
of
the
same
disease
and
to
the
anxious
queen
every
day
was
an
anniversary
she
hastened
to
the
home
of
the
prince
at
sandringham
and
when
she
saw
how
ill
he
was
she
sent
at
once
for
the
other
members
of
the
family
the
days
passed
slowly
one
day
he
seemed
a
little
better
and
there
was
rejoicing
as
the
telegraph
flashed
the
news
not
only
over
england
but
to
canada
india
to
every
part
of
the
world
then
came
a
day
of
hopelessness
the
queen
mother
watched
every
symptom
can
you
not
save
him
she
pleaded
and
all
the
physicians
could
answer
was
you
must
be
prepared
for
the
worst
we
fear
that
the
end
is
near
bulletins
were
sent
out
to
the
public
every
hour
or
two
all
london
seemed
to
tremble
with
fear
and
anxiety
stores
were
open
but
there
was
little
of
either
buying
or
selling
day
and
night
the
citizens
crowded
the
streets
in
front
of
the
newspaper
offices
they
talked
of
no
one
but
the
prince
he
a
good
boy
to
his
mother
said
one
and
she
miss
him
sorely
he
living
yet
god
bless
him
and
perhaps
after
all
he
mend
declared
another
of
more
hopeful
spirit
did
you
ever
hear
that
when
he
was
a
little
chap
and
his
tutor
was
going
to
leave
him
the
young
man
could
go
into
his
room
without
finding
a
little
present
on
his
pillow
or
perhaps
a
note
from
the
little
boy
saying
how
much
he
should
miss
him
it
kill
the
queen
said
one
man
the
poor
woman
had
all
she
can
bear
and
she
never
go
through
this
and
the
prince
boy
but
eight
years
old
declared
another
there
be
a
regent
for
ten
years
and
no
one
can
say
what
harm
will
come
to
the
country
in
that
time
so
the
days
passed
the
fourteenth
of
december
came
the
anniversary
of
the
day
on
which
the
prince
consort
had
died
the
prince
breathed
and
that
was
all
the
people
about
the
offices
were
hushed
everyone
dreaded
to
hear
the
next
message
but
when
it
came
it
said
better
london
hardly
dared
to
rejoice
but
the
prince
continued
to
gain
and
at
last
the
queen
joyfully
granted
the
wish
of
her
people
and
appointed
a
thanksgiving
day
the
special
service
was
held
at
paul
church
and
there
were
many
tears
of
joy
when
the
queen
walked
up
the
nave
between
the
prince
and
the
princess
of
wales
after
the
religious
ceremony
was
over
the
guns
roared
out
the
delight
of
the
people
and
a
wild
excitement
of
happiness
began
at
night
paul
was
illuminated
and
everyone
was
jubilant
the
queen
was
deeply
touched
and
pleased
with
the
warm
sympathy
shown
by
her
subjects
and
a
day
or
two
later
she
sent
a
little
letter
to
be
published
in
the
papers
to
tell
them
how
happy
they
had
made
her
only
two
days
after
this
letter
was
written
there
was
a
great
alarm
for
when
the
queen
went
out
to
drive
a
young
fellow
sprang
towards
the
carriage
and
aimed
a
pistol
at
her
he
was
seized
in
a
moment
and
proved
to
be
a
boy
of
seventeen
whose
pistol
had
neither
powder
nor
bullet
most
of
the
queen
personal
attendants
were
highlanders
and
one
of
them
john
brown
had
thrown
himself
between
her
and
what
he
supposed
was
the
bullet
of
an
assassin
both
the
queen
and
prince
albert
were
always
most
appreciative
of
faithful
service
and
looked
upon
it
as
something
which
money
could
not
buy
she
had
been
thinking
of
having
special
medals
made
to
give
to
her
servants
who
deserved
a
special
reward
and
she
now
gave
the
first
one
to
john
brown
with
the
medal
went
an
annuity
of
john
brown
seemed
to
have
no
thought
but
for
the
queen
to
serve
her
and
care
for
her
was
his
one
interest
he
cared
nothing
about
court
manners
and
was
perhaps
the
only
person
in
the
land
who
dared
to
find
fault
with
its
sovereign
to
her
face
statesmen
would
bow
meekly
before
her
but
the
scotchman
always
spoke
his
mind
he
even
ventured
to
criticise
her
clothes
the
queen
never
did
care
very
much
for
fine
raiment
and
in
her
journal
where
she
narrates
so
minutely
as
to
mention
the
fact
that
a
glass
of
water
was
brought
her
she
describes
her
dress
merely
as
quite
thin
things
john
brown
thought
nothing
was
good
enough
for
his
royal
mistress
what
that
thing
ye
got
on
he
would
demand
with
most
evident
disapproval
if
a
cloak
or
gown
was
not
up
to
his
notion
of
what
she
ought
to
wear
and
this
queen
who
knew
so
well
what
was
due
to
her
position
knew
also
that
honest
affection
is
better
than
courtly
manners
and
kept
brown
in
close
attendance
she
built
several
little
picnic
cottages
far
up
in
the
hills
where
she
and
some
of
her
children
would
often
go
for
a
few
days
when
they
were
at
balmoral
there
is
a
story
that
when
she
was
staying
at
one
of
these
cottages
she
wished
to
go
out
to
sketch
a
table
was
brought
her
but
it
was
too
high
the
next
was
too
low
and
the
third
was
not
solid
enough
to
stand
firmly
so
far
john
brown
had
not
interfered
but
now
he
brought
back
one
of
the
tables
and
said
bluntly
they
canna
make
one
for
you
up
here
the
queen
laughed
and
found
that
it
would
answer
very
well
one
can
not
help
wondering
what
queen
victoria
guests
thought
of
her
attendant
blunt
ways
but
they
must
have
often
envied
her
his
honest
devotion
in
and
she
had
several
very
interesting
visitors
one
of
them
was
david
livingstone
the
african
explorer
what
do
the
people
in
the
wilderness
ask
you
queried
the
queen
they
ask
many
questions
he
replied
but
perhaps
the
one
i
hear
oftenest
is
your
queen
very
rich
and
when
i
say
they
ask
rich
is
she
how
many
cows
does
she
own
other
visitors
were
a
group
of
envoys
from
the
king
of
burmah
a
monarch
with
such
strict
regard
for
what
he
looked
upon
as
royal
etiquette
that
he
would
not
allow
the
british
representative
to
come
into
his
presence
unless
the
indignant
englishman
took
off
his
shoes
before
attempting
to
enter
the
audience
room
his
letter
to
the
queen
began
with
the
flourishes
that
would
be
expected
from
so
punctilious
a
potentate
from
his
great
glorious
and
most
excellent
majesty
king
of
the
rising
sun
who
reigns
over
burmah
to
her
most
glorious
and
excellent
majesty
victoria
queen
of
great
britain
and
ireland
he
sent
among
other
gifts
a
gold
bracelet
which
must
have
been
of
more
value
than
use
for
it
weighed
seven
pounds
the
guest
who
made
the
greatest
sensation
was
the
shah
of
persia
for
more
than
two
months
he
was
on
his
way
to
england
and
the
nearer
he
came
the
more
wild
were
the
fancies
that
people
had
about
him
the
newspapers
were
full
of
stories
about
his
dagger
whose
diamonds
were
so
dazzling
they
said
that
one
might
as
well
gaze
at
the
midday
sun
they
told
amazing
tales
about
the
pocket
money
which
he
had
brought
with
him
some
putting
the
amount
as
others
as
when
he
walks
about
jewels
fall
upon
the
ground
one
newspaper
declared
he
wears
a
black
velvet
tunic
all
sprinkled
with
diamonds
and
he
has
epaulets
of
emeralds
as
big
as
walnuts
romanced
another
the
curiosity
seekers
were
disappointed
when
he
appeared
though
it
would
seem
as
if
he
had
enough
jewelry
to
make
himself
worth
at
least
a
glance
for
up
and
down
his
coat
were
rows
of
rubies
and
diamonds
he
wore
a
scimitar
and
that
together
with
his
belt
and
cap
was
sparkling
with
precious
stones
while
his
fingers
were
loaded
with
rings
the
queen
came
from
balmoral
to
welcome
him
whether
she
gave
him
the
formal
kiss
that
was
expected
between
sovereigns
the
accounts
do
not
state
but
all
sorts
of
entertainments
were
arranged
for
him
a
great
ball
a
review
of
artillery
an
italian
opera
and
many
other
amusements
he
was
much
interested
in
the
review
and
the
troops
must
have
been
interested
in
him
for
he
rode
an
arab
horse
whose
tail
had
been
dyed
a
bright
pink
at
this
review
one
of
the
newspaper
stories
proved
very
nearly
true
for
a
member
of
the
persian
suite
fell
from
his
horse
and
really
did
scatter
diamonds
about
him
on
the
grass
after
a
visit
of
a
little
more
than
two
weeks
the
shah
bade
farewell
to
england
before
his
departure
there
was
an
exchange
of
courtesies
between
himself
and
the
queen
she
made
him
a
knight
of
the
garter
and
he
made
her
a
member
of
a
persian
order
which
he
had
just
instituted
for
ladies
the
queen
gave
him
a
badge
and
collar
of
the
garter
set
in
diamonds
and
he
returned
the
gift
by
presenting
her
with
his
photograph
in
a
circle
of
diamonds
in
the
midst
of
this
entertainment
and
display
the
tender
heart
of
the
queen
was
more
than
once
deeply
grieved
by
the
death
of
dear
friends
the
cherished
féodore
the
princess
hohenlohe
died
then
the
queen
lost
mcleod
the
scotch
clergyman
who
had
so
helped
and
comforted
her
in
her
troubles
hardly
two
months
had
passed
after
his
death
before
letters
came
from
darmstadt
princess
alice
had
been
away
for
a
short
time
counting
the
hours
before
she
could
be
with
her
children
again
at
last
she
was
at
home
with
them
and
happy
the
two
little
boys
were
brought
to
her
chamber
one
morning
and
as
she
stepped
for
a
moment
into
the
adjoining
room
one
of
them
frittie
fell
from
the
window
to
the
stone
terrace
and
died
in
a
few
hours
the
mother
longed
to
go
to
her
own
mother
for
comfort
in
her
trouble
but
she
could
not
leave
her
home
neither
could
the
queen
come
to
her
warm
tender
words
of
sympathy
came
from
england
from
a
queen
mother
who
well
knew
what
sorrow
meant
can
you
bear
to
play
on
the
piano
yet
she
asked
some
three
months
after
the
accident
for
it
was
long
after
the
death
of
prince
albert
before
she
herself
could
endure
the
sound
of
music
princess
alice
replied
it
seems
as
if
i
never
could
play
again
on
that
piano
where
little
hands
were
nearly
always
thrust
when
i
wanted
to
play
ernie
asked
ca
we
all
die
together
i
do
like
to
die
alone
like
frittie
while
the
heart
of
the
queen
was
aching
with
sympathy
for
her
daughter
she
had
also
to
attend
to
arrangements
for
the
marriage
of
her
sailor
son
affie
now
duke
of
edinburgh
with
the
daughter
of
the
emperor
of
russia
she
herself
could
not
go
to
the
wedding
at
petersburg
but
she
asked
dean
stanley
to
go
and
perform
the
english
ceremony
for
as
the
bride
was
a
member
of
the
greek
church
there
was
a
double
rite
to
dean
stanley
wife
she
sent
a
mysterious
little
parcel
containing
two
sprigs
of
myrtle
and
with
it
a
letter
which
asked
her
to
put
them
into
warm
water
and
when
the
wedding
day
came
to
place
them
in
a
bouquet
of
white
flowers
for
the
bride
the
myrtle
had
grown
from
the
slip
in
the
bridal
bouquet
of
the
princess
royal
and
in
the
five
marriages
of
royal
children
that
had
preceded
this
one
each
bride
had
carried
a
bit
of
the
bush
when
the
bride
reached
balmoral
a
company
of
volunteers
in
kilts
were
waiting
to
receive
her
just
beyond
were
the
tenants
on
the
estate
all
in
their
best
clothes
the
pipers
were
present
of
course
and
the
best
clothes
of
the
queen
pipers
were
well
worth
seeing
the
kilt
was
of
stuart
plaid
and
the
tunic
of
black
velvet
over
the
shoulder
was
a
silver
chain
from
which
hung
a
silver
powder
horn
the
bag
for
the
pipe
was
of
blue
velvet
ornaments
were
worn
wherever
there
was
a
place
for
them
but
the
only
jewels
were
cairngorms
and
they
were
always
set
in
silver
the
shoes
had
heavy
silver
buckles
the
bride
and
all
her
royal
friends
drove
to
the
castle
where
their
health
was
drunk
by
a
merry
company
the
end
of
the
queen
account
of
this
reception
of
royalty
sounds
delightfully
simple
and
homelike
we
took
marie
and
alfred
to
their
rooms
downstairs
she
says
and
sat
with
them
while
they
had
their
tea
in
so
large
a
family
as
that
of
the
queen
there
was
always
a
birth
or
a
marriage
a
coming
or
a
going
not
long
after
the
marriage
of
his
brother
alfred
the
prince
of
wales
left
england
to
spend
some
months
in
india
this
journey
was
not
a
pleasure
trip
it
had
a
state
purpose
and
that
was
to
pay
honor
to
the
native
princes
who
had
aided
the
english
in
their
efforts
to
govern
india
the
prince
was
well
accustomed
to
being
received
with
cheering
and
the
firing
of
guns
but
his
indian
reception
was
something
entirely
new
at
one
place
elephants
painted
in
different
colors
trumpeted
a
greeting
in
another
which
was
ruled
by
a
lady
the
sovereign
met
him
but
she
could
hardly
be
said
to
have
made
her
appearance
for
her
face
was
thickly
veiled
at
still
another
he
was
carried
up
a
hill
in
a
superb
chair
made
of
silver
and
gold
there
was
a
boar
hunt
an
antelope
hunt
and
an
elephant
fight
there
was
a
marvelously
beautiful
illumination
of
surf
there
were
addresses
presented
by
people
of
all
shades
of
complexion
and
all
varieties
of
costume
often
so
magnificent
that
some
one
called
the
wearers
animated
nuggets
this
visit
of
the
prince
of
wales
was
followed
by
the
assumption
of
the
title
of
empress
of
india
there
was
a
vast
amount
of
talk
about
the
new
title
for
many
english
thought
that
it
was
foolish
and
childish
to
make
any
change
on
the
other
hand
empress
was
the
proper
title
for
a
woman
who
ruled
over
many
kings
even
kings
of
india
there
were
stories
afloat
that
one
reason
why
the
queen
wished
to
become
an
empress
was
because
the
russian
princess
who
was
the
daughter
of
an
emperor
had
claimed
precedence
over
the
english
princesses
who
were
only
the
daughters
of
a
queen
however
that
may
be
the
title
was
formally
assumed
in
it
was
proclaimed
in
india
with
all
magnificence
princes
were
present
to
hear
the
proclamation
there
were
thousands
of
troops
and
long
lines
of
elephants
a
throne
that
was
a
vision
of
splendor
was
built
high
up
above
the
plain
and
on
this
sat
the
viceroy
of
the
queen
who
received
the
honors
intended
for
her
queen
victoria
was
much
pleased
with
the
new
title
and
soon
began
to
sign
her
name
victoria
for
regina
et
imperatrix
to
all
documents
though
it
had
been
expected
that
she
would
affix
it
to
her
signature
only
when
signing
papers
relating
to
india
another
title
which
she
enjoyed
was
that
of
daughter
of
the
regiment
the
duke
of
kent
had
been
in
command
of
the
royal
scots
at
the
time
of
her
birth
and
therefore
they
looked
upon
her
as
having
been
born
in
the
regiment
in
the
autumn
of
this
same
year
she
presented
them
with
new
colors
and
there
was
a
little
ceremony
which
delighted
her
because
it
was
evidently
so
sincere
there
was
first
a
salute
then
marching
and
countermarching
while
the
band
played
old
marches
that
were
her
favorites
among
them
one
from
the
fille
du
régiment
to
hint
that
she
belonged
especially
to
them
then
there
was
perfect
silence
two
officers
knelt
before
her
and
she
presented
them
with
the
new
colors
first
making
a
little
speech
the
royal
scots
were
greatly
pleased
because
in
her
speech
she
said
i
have
been
associated
with
your
regiment
from
my
earliest
infancy
and
i
was
always
taught
to
consider
myself
a
soldier
child
in
spite
of
her
many
years
experience
in
making
short
speeches
and
of
her
perfect
calmness
in
public
in
her
earlier
years
the
queen
was
never
quite
at
ease
in
speaking
to
an
audience
after
prince
albert
died
and
she
said
of
this
occasion
i
was
terribly
nervous
she
never
ceased
to
miss
the
supporting
presence
of
the
prince
and
she
wrote
pitifully
of
her
first
public
appearance
after
his
death
there
was
no
one
to
direct
me
and
to
say
as
formerly
what
was
to
be
done
the
queen
was
soon
to
feel
even
more
lonely
for
late
in
the
autumn
of
there
came
a
time
of
intense
anxiety
then
of
the
deepest
sorrow
princess
alice
husband
and
children
were
attacked
by
diphtheria
little
sunshine
as
her
youngest
daughter
was
called
in
the
home
died
after
three
days
illness
the
mother
hid
her
grief
as
best
she
could
that
the
other
children
should
not
know
of
their
loss
three
weeks
later
she
too
was
taken
with
the
same
disease
and
died
on
the
seventeenth
anniversary
of
her
father
death
little
children
and
poor
peasant
women
of
hesse
were
among
those
who
laid
flowers
on
her
bier
and
shared
in
the
grief
of
the
sorrowing
monarch
across
the
channel
the
queen
had
built
a
cairn
at
balmoral
in
memory
of
the
prince
consort
others
had
been
built
from
time
to
time
one
rising
merrily
with
laughing
and
dancing
to
commemorate
the
purchase
of
the
estate
others
erected
to
mark
the
date
of
the
marriage
of
the
sons
and
daughters
of
the
house
to
these
a
granite
cross
was
now
added
to
the
memory
of
the
beloved
daughter
by
her
sorrowing
mother
queen
victoria
said
the
inscription
so
it
was
that
the
happy
circle
of
sons
and
daughters
was
first
broken
so
it
was
that
the
years
of
the
queen
passed
on
full
of
the
joys
and
sorrows
that
seemed
to
come
to
her
almost
hand
in
hand
chapter
xiv
the
jubilee
season
with
the
exception
of
prince
alfred
the
queen
children
had
married
according
to
the
german
proverb
the
oldest
must
leave
the
house
first
the
next
in
age
was
prince

or
the
duke
of
connaught
he
married
in
princess
louise
of
prussia
with
the
usual
magnificent
display
at
george
chapel
the
real
home
welcome
however
was
awaiting
them
at
balmoral
where
they
arrived
a
few
months
later
when
the
train
came
to
a
standstill
there
stood
the
queen
and
princess
beatrice
with
the
royal
scots
for
a
guard
of
honor
the
queen
gave
the
bride
a
bouquet
of
heather
and
they
set
off
for
the
castle
at
the
end
of
the
balmoral
bridge
was
an
arch
of
moss
and
heather
with
a
motto
in
flowers
welcome
to
balmoral
there
stood
the
castle
guests
and
there
were
all
the
tenants
the
women
in
their
sunday
clothes
the
men
in
kilts
and
the
pipers
playing
their
best
and
loudest
while
the
children
tossed
flowers
into
the
carriages
and
shouted
their
welcome
of
course
a
cairn
had
been
begun
in
honor
of
the
marriage
and
two
or
three
days
later
the
happy
party
went
to
visit
it
the
queen
on
her
pony
and
the
others
walking
there
was
a
speech
of
congratulation
made
and
the
health
of
the
young
people
was
drunk
the
health
of
the
princess
beatrice
ought
to
be
drunk
brown
declared
and
that
was
done
with
so
many
cheers
that
even
the
dogs
objected
to
the
tumult
and
began
to
bark
after
the
cheering
each
one
of
the
party
walked
up
to
the
cairn
and
laid
a
stone
upon
it
one
of
the
stones
in
the
foundation
was
already
marked
with
the
names
of
the
duke
and
duchess
and
the
date
of
their
marriage
three
years
later
george
chapel
was
again
ablaze
with
the
splendor
of
another
royal
wedding
that
of
prince
leopold
the
eighth
child
of
the
queen
to
princess
hélène
of
in
the
evening
a
state
banquet
was
given
and
some
of
the
guests
were
much
amazed
when
just
before
the
queen
was
to
rise
from
the
table
her
two
scotch
pipers
in
their
full
highland
costume
appeared
at
the
door
and
marched
twice
around
the
room
playing
merry
scottish
airs
the
home
of
the
newly
married
couple
was
to
be
at
claremont
the
place
where
the
little
princess
victoria
had
so
enjoyed
herself
it
had
been
granted
to
king
leopold
when
he
married
princess
charlotte
but
on
his
death
it
again
became
the
property
of
the
crown
the
queen
now
bought
it
for
the
king
namesake
she
had
given
to
her
son
the
title
of
duke
of
albany
and
some
of
the
superstitious
among
her
subjects
shook
their
heads
at
that
for
so
many
who
had
borne
the
title
had
met
with
misfortune
or
even
with
early
death
the
wedding
celebrations
were
hardly
over
before
the
queen
thoughts
were
centered
upon
egypt
the
khedive
of
egypt
was
a
great
borrower
and
to
fill
his
ever
empty
purse
he
had
offered
england
some
seven
years
previously
his
shares
in
the
suez
canal
for
england
had
been
very
ready
to
buy
them
and
also
to
guarantee
that
people
who
had
loaned
money
to
this
spendthrift
should
not
lose
their
interest
in
some
of
the
khedive
subjects
rebelled
against
him
and
got
control
of
the
government
to
maintain
taxation
and
so
pay
the
promised
interest
england
must
support
the
khedive
and
put
down
the
rebels
the
queen
hated
war
as
badly
as
her
predecessor
elizabeth
but
as
soon
as
she
saw
that
it
was
necessary
she
had
no
patience
with
delay
or
poor
preparation
she
sent
directions
continually
to
the
war
office
now
about
arms
now
about
blankets
or
food
or
the
comforts
that
would
be
needed
in
the
hospitals
she
never
had
the
slightest
sympathy
with
indecision
or
lack
of
promptness
and
the
moment
that
she
thought
of
something
that
ought
to
be
done
for
her
soldiers
she
sent
a
message
to
the
minister
of
war
during
one
day
she
sent
him
seventeen

windsor

the
troops
sailed
telegrams
were
frequent
and
on
a
monday
morning
in
september
there
came
to
balmoral
one
marked
very
secret
it
was
written
in
cipher
and
said
determined
to
attack
the
enemy
with
a
large
force
on
wednesday
there
could
be
no
report
of
the
battle
for
two
days
at
least
but
the
queen
and
her
family
tried
hard
to
be
brave
and
cheerful
more
than
once
the
queen
slipped
away
from
them
to
pray
that
her
son
might
return
to
her
in
safety
for
the
duke
of
connaught
was
in
egypt
in
command
of
a
brigade
wednesday
morning
a
telegram
came
the
army
marched
out
last
night
a
second
arrived
a
little
later
the
enemy
has
been
routed
at
but
fighting
is
going
on
louischen
the
wife
of
the
duke
was
with
the
queen
they
could
think
of
nothing
but
the
husband
and
son
far
away
beside
the
nile
any
moment
might
be
the
fatal
one
they
almost
fancied
they
could
hear
the
boom
of
the
cannon
never
was
a
morning
so
long
but
at
last
the
word
came
a
great
victory
duke
safe
and
well
led
his
brigade
to
the
attack
the
queen
hurried
to
find
louischen
and
threw
her
arms
about
her
neck
how
glad
and
proud
and
thankful
we
can
be
she
exclaimed
with
tears
not
of
sorrow
but
of
joy
that
afternoon
the
duke
of
albany
and
his
wife
arrived
and
then
there
was
a
double
rejoicing
after
the
drinking
of
healths
of
bride
and
bridegroom
john
brown
stepped
forward
and
said
ladies
and
gentlemen
let
us
join
in
a
good
highland
cheer
for
the
duke
and
duchess
of
albany
may
they
live
long
and
die
happy
and
then
there
was
such
cheering
as
made
the
woods
and
hills
ring
years
before
when
word
had
come
of
the
fall
of
sebastopol
a
bonfire
had
been
lighted
on
the
top
of
craig
gowan
and
now
there
was
another
in
honor
of
the
egyptian
victory
it
was
very
dark
but
no
one
cared
for
that
the
two
princesses
and
many
of
the
people
in
the
house
walked
up
to
the
top
of
the
hill
with
the
pipes
playing
jubilantly
there
the
bonfire
was
lighted
and
the
queen
watched
from
the
windows
and
listened
to
the
pipes
and
the
cheering
when
the
princesses
came
down
they
all
had
a
little
supper
together
in
louischen
room
with
all
these
family
celebrations
indeed
with
almost
every
action
of
the
queen
life
john
brown
was
closely
associated
in
private
and
in
public
he
was
the
attendant
of
his
sovereign
ever
on
the
watch
to
save
her
not
only
from
danger
but
from
the
least
annoyance
on
one
occasion
the
queen
carriage
stopped
in
a
village
after
dark
and
curious
people
thronged
about
one
man
actually
held
up
a
lantern
to
get
a
plainer
view
of
her
face
but
all
that
met
his
eyes
was
the
rugged
determined
features
of
john
brown
for
the
faithful
man
had
calmly
put
himself
between
the
queen
and
her
inquisitive
subject
on
another
occasion
a
woman
pushed
up
to
the
carriage
and
stood
leaning
upon
the
wheel
and
staring
at
the
queen
john
brown
thought
it
a
waste
of
courtesy
to
be
gentle
with
such
a
person
and
he
growled
be
off
with
you
like
an
angry
policeman
to
a
crowd
of
troublesome
ragamuffins
in
this
faithful
servant
died
there
could
hardly
have
been
a
time
when
the
queen
had
more
need
of
him
for
by
a
fall
on
the
staircase
at
windsor
she
had
become
unable
to
walk
or
even
to
stand
during
the
months
of
her
lameness
she
prepared
for
publication
a
volume
of
extracts
from
her
journal
for
to
the
dedication
read
to
my
loyal
highlanders
and
especially
to
the
memory
of
my
devoted
personal
attendant
john
brown
she
was
as
modest
about
this
book
as
about
the
first
one
and
with
the
copy
that
she
presented
to
tennyson
she
sent
an
almost
shy
little
note
saying
though
a
very
humble
and
unpretending
author
i
send
you
my
new
book
which
perhaps
you
may
like
to
glance
at
its
only
merit
is
its
simplicity
and
truth
the
queen
lameness
did
not
prevent
her
from
making
her
usual
spring
visit
to
balmoral
in
but
the
most
unusual
precautions
were
taken
to
insure
her
safety
within
two
or
three
years
the
emperor
of
russia
had
been
assassinated
and
in
london
several
attempts
had
been
made
recently
to
blow
up
public
buildings
with
dynamite
generally
when
the
queen
traveled
her
was
known
and
people
were
at
every
station
to
give
her
welcome
an
engine
was
always
sent
before
the
train
to
make
sure
that
the
road
was
clear
but
this
time
however
the
were
kept
secret
and
no
spectators
were
allowed
to
gather
at
the
stations
men
were
usually
at
work
on
the
road
averaging
one
to
every
these
men
were
now
supplied
with
flags
to
wave
as
the
train
came
in
sight
if
the
engineer
saw
a
white
flag
he
knew
the
way
was
clear
for
half
a
mile
but
if
the
red
one
was
waved
he
knew
there
was
danger
or
some
obstruction
ahead
and
that
he
must
stop
at
once
the
queen
was
still
so
much
of
an
invalid
that
she
could
stand
only
a
few
minutes
when
the
day
came
that
she
had
to
be
told
of
the
sudden
death
of
her
youngest
son
he
was
the
only
one
of
the
nine
children
who
had
not
been
strong
but
the
queen
loved
him
all
the
better
for
his
sufferings
he
was
much
like
his
father
in
mind
and
she
had
hoped
that
he
would
be
able
to
act
as
her
private
secretary
even
when
he
was
ill
he
was
so
merry
and
unselfish
that
all
who
saw
him
loved
him
he
never
seemed
to
realize
that
there
was
anything
in
him
to
call
out
their
affection
and
he
once
said
very
simply
i
ca
think
why
people
should
always
be
so
kind
to
me
the
queen
felt
that
the
joy
had
gone
from
her
life
but
she
sent
to
her
people
the
message
i
will
labor
on
as
long
as
i
can
for
the
sake
of
my
children
and
for
the
good
of
the
country
i
love
so
well
the
government
of
her
country
gave
her
little
pleasure
at
that
time
for
in
spite
of
all
that
she
could
do
grave
trouble
was
arising
from
what
she
believed
was
the
mistaken
course
of
her
ministers
egypt
had
been
pacified
three
years
before
but
there
was
revolt
in
the
soudan
a
man
named
mohammed
had
gone
about
among
the
wild
arabs
declaring
i
am
the
prophet
who
was
to
follow
the
great
mohammed
for
twelve
hundred
years
the
world
has
been
awaiting
me
come
and
fight
under
my
banner
thousands
rose
to
join
him
and
mohammed
or
the
mahdi
as
he
was
called
led
them
against
the
khedive
that
ruler
was
helpless
to
repulse
them
england
was
responsible
for
the
good
order
of
his
country
and
the
ministers
debated
the
question
long
and
seriously
what
to
do
in
egypt
let
us
send
troops
to
the
soudan
and
suppress
the
rebellion
advised
one
that
is
what
the
queen
wishes
said
another
but
it
may
be
that
the
soudan
is
not
worth
so
many
lives
as
would
be
wasted
in
conquering
the
rebels
it
is
not
declared
another
positively
let
us
attempt
nothing
but
to
keep
the
mahdi
out
of
egypt
but
what
of
our
english
and
egyptian
garrisons
in
the
soudan
that
was
a
grave
question
and
a
long
discussion
followed
the
government
then
in
power
was
ready
to
do
almost
anything
to
avoid
war
the
queen
looked
upon
the
matter
differently
she
was
now
no
girl
of
eighteen
she
was
a
woman
with
nearly
fifty
years
experience
in
dealing
with
nations
civilized
and
nations
uncivilized
she
believed
that
it
was
best
to
hold
on
to
the
soudan
but
since
her
ministers
were
determined
to
abandon
it
to
the
revolters
she
saw
that
the
only
thing
to
do
was
to
lose
no
time
in
confronting
the
mahdi
with
an
army
so
overwhelmingly
superior
to
his
own
forces
that
he
would
not
dare
to
attack
the
garrisons
the
ministers
did
not
agree
with
her
general
gordon
has
already
shown
that
he
knows
how
to
manage
the
people
of
the
soudan
they
said
and
he
will
be
able
to
persuade
the
mahdi
to
let
the
garrisons
go
free
with
an
army
to
support
him
yes
said
the
queen
but
alone
no
nevertheless
general
gordon
was
sent
to
cross
the
desert
almost
alone
in
spite
of
all
that
the
brave
commander
could
do
the
mahdi
could
not
be
persuaded
to
let
the
garrisons
go
and
soon
the
envoy
himself
was
shut
up
in
khartoum
help
us
he
pleaded
with
england
send
us
troops
still
the
government
delayed
in
spite
of
the
warnings
no
help
came
and
general
gordon
then
sent
a
messenger
to
beg
private
parties
in
the
british
colonies
and
the
united
states
for
money
to
organize
a
relief
expedition
but
the
messengers
were
captured
and
put
to
death
the
queen
urged
and
insisted
that
relief
should
be
given
and
the
people
insisted
with
her
troops
were
sent
at
last
and
they
hastened
on
till
they
were
only
a
mile
and
a
half
from
khartoum
but
they
were
hours
too
late
for
the
city
had
fallen
and
general
gordon
had
been
slain
queen
victoria
was
a
constitutional
monarch
she
had
stood
firmly
by
her
ministers
ever
since
the
bedchamber
plot
of
the
first
year
of
her
reign
but
she
was
also
a
woman
a
loving
woman
and
she
wrote
to
general
gordon
sister
a
letter
in
which
sympathy
for
her
loss
and
indignation
for
the
stain
left
upon
england
were
mingled
she
said
dear
miss
gordon
how
shall
i
write
to
you
or
how
shall
i
attempt
to
express
what
i
feel
to
think
of
your
dear
noble
heroic
brother
who
served
his
country
and
his
queen
so
truly
so
heroically
with
a
so
edifying
to
the
world
not
having
been
rescued
that
the
promises
of
support
were
not
fulfilled
which
i
so
frequently
and
constantly
pressed
on
those
who
asked
him
to
go
is
to
me
grief
inexpressible
general
gordon
diary
was
found
and
sent
to
his
sister
its
last
entry
was
i
have
done
my
best
for
the
honor
of
our
country
his
bible
was
presented
by
his
sister
to
the
queen
it
was
placed
on
a
cushion
of
white
satin
in
an
exquisite
casket
of
carved
crystal
with
silver
mountings
this
is
one
of
my
greatest
treasures
the
queen
often
said
as
she
sadly
pointed
it
out
to
her
friends
the
queen
was
aroused
from
her
sorrow
over
what
she
ever
looked
upon
as
a
disgrace
to
her
country
by
the
approaching
marriage
of
princess
beatrice
to
prince
henry
of
battenberg
their
wedding
was
quite
different
from
those
of
the
other
royal
children
for
it
was
celebrated
at
the
country
church
near
osborne
no
one
knew
how
to
manage
a
royal
wedding
in
a
little
village
church
and
there
were
all
sorts
of
momentous
questions
to
be
settled
before
the
arrangements
were
complete
it
all
came
out
well
in
the
end
however
there
was
not
room
for
quite
so
many
royalties
as
usual
but
the
wedding
day
was
a
delightful
holiday
for
the
people
of
the
isle
of
wight
for
there
were
fireworks
bands
a
dinner
and
a
dance
for
all
the
tenants
and
servants
on
the
estate
and
a
most
beautiful
display
of
sailing
vessels
and
steamers
tennyson
home
was
on
the
isle
of
wight
and
the
queen
sent
him
a
charmingly
informal
invitation
to
the
wedding
it
would
give
me
the
greatest
pleasure
she
wrote
if
you
would
come
over
for
the
wedding
in
our
village
church
but
i
fear
you
wo
do
that
but
pray
come
and
see
me
when
all
is
quiet
again
tennyson
did
not
attend
the
wedding
but
the
princess
must
have
counted
among
her
choicest
gifts
his
message
to
the
royal
bride
the
old
poet
sends
his
blessing
this
marriage
alone
of
all
those
in
the
royal
family
was
not
to
bring
separation
for
it
was
agreed
that
the
princess
and
prince
henry
should
remain
with
the
queen
this
queen
and
empress
had
now
been
on
the
throne
for
nearly
half
a
century
and
throughout
her
dominions
there
was
a
feeling
that
so
rare
an
event
ought
to
be
celebrated
with
fitting
magnificence
the
jubilee
feeling
was
in
the
air
every
town
and
every
little
village
wished
to
mark
the
time
by
something
that
should
remain
as
a
lasting
memorial
libraries
hospitals
and
museums
were
founded
and
parks
were
purchased
and
thrown
open
to
the
public
memorial
clocks
statues
schools
and
towers
sprang
into
being
in
every
corner
of
the
land
and
in
all
the
colonies
god
save
the
queen
was
sung
in
hindustanee
on
the
shores
of
asia
and
in
hebrew
in
the
synagogues
of
london
addresses
of
congratulation
and
loyalty
came
in
by
the
score
representatives
of
all
the
colonies
flocked
to
england
as
sons
and
daughters
hastened
homeward
to
a
family
gathering
the
part
to
be
taken
in
the
celebration
by
associations
cities
and
kingdoms
had
all
been
planned
when
it
occurred
to
the
editor
of
one
of
the
london
newspapers
that
nobody
had
remembered
the
children
let
us
give
the
boys
and
girls
of
london
a
feast
and
an
entertainment
in
hyde
park
he
suggested
you
ca
do
it
declared
the
grumblers
it
is
a
foolish
wicked
scheme
there
will
be
a
crush
accidents
will
happen
and
hundreds
will
be
injured
nevertheless
people
subscribed
so
generously
that
soon
all
the
money
needed
had
been
provided
when
the
children
came
to
the
park
they
were
taken
in
groups
to
great
tents
and
when
they
came
out
each
one
had
a
paper
bag
which
contained
a
meat
pie
a
piece
of
cake
a
bun
and
an
orange
their
little
hands
must
have
been
full
for
besides
the
eatables
each
one
received
a
little
medallion
portrait
of
the
queen
and
a
jubilee
mug
the
mugs
saw
hard
service
among
the
thirsty
little
folk
for
all
day
milk
lemonade
and
ginger
beer
were
free
to
every
child
who
presented
his
empty
mug
the
children
were
amused
by
all
sorts
of
games
and
shows
dukes
and
princes
and
representatives
of
powerful
kingdoms
came
to
see
the
good
time
and
at
last
the
queen
herself
came
and
gave
a
special
greeting
not
to
the
grown
folk
but
every
word
of
it
to
the
children
long
before
bedtime
had
come
every
one
of
the
thousand
small
people
was
safe
in
his
own
home
and
the
grumblers
grumbled
no
more
june
was
jubilee
day
fifty
years
had
passed
since
the
young
girl
had
been
aroused
from
her
sleep
to
hear
that
she
was
queen
of
a
mighty
nation
and
now
in
all
the
glory
of
her
half
century
of
successful
sovereignty
she
was
to
go
to
westminster
abbey
to
thank
god
for
his
help
and
protection
she
now
represented
not
a
kingdom
but
an
enormous
empire
and
every
corner
of
it
wished
to
do
her
honor
the
streets
of
london
were
spanned
by
triumphal
arches
they
were
made
into
a
fairyland
of
flowers
banners
drapings
of
silk
and
velvet
and
tapestry
staging
for
seats
had
been
put
up
all
along
the
route
and
every
seat
was
filled
fabulous
prices
were
paid
for
a
house
a
window
or
even
a
few
square
inches
on
a
rough
plank
thousands
of
people
had
been
out
since
sunrise
to
secure
a
place
to
see
the
grand
procession
and
at
last
it
came
in
sight
moving
slowly
toward
the
multitude
that
waited
all
with
excitement
and
with
devotion
to
the
noble
woman
who
was
the
symbol
of
home
and
country
first
came
the
carriages
containing
the
princes
of
india
robed
in
cloth
of
gold
and
shaded
with
turbans
glittering
with
priceless
jewels
many
carriages
followed
filled
with
kings
queens
crown
princes
and
grand
dukes
there
were
equerries
an
escort
of
life
guards
and
a
guard
of
honor
composed
of
princes
riding
three
abreast
the
queen
sons
grandsons
and
towering
up
among
them
was
the
superb
figure
of
prince
fritz
crown
prince
of
a
united
germany
his
uniform
was
of
pure
white
his
helmet
of
burnished
steel
and
on
it
was
the
prussian
eagle
with
outspread
wings
at
last
the
woman
for
whom
all
were
waiting
came
in
sight
the
splendid
robes
of
her
coronation
were
fifty
years
behind
her
but
even
in
her
plainer
dress
she
looked
every
inch
a
queen
the
princess
alexandra
and
the
crown
princess
of
germany
were
with
her
for
years
the
sovereign
had
so
rarely
appeared
in
public
that
to
her
subjects
this
was
more
than
a
mere
royal
procession
it
was
the
coming
back
to
them
of
their
queen
a
great
wave
of
devotion
and
loyalty
swept
over
the
hearts
of
the
throng
not
queen
but
queen
they
said
to
themselves
and
such
a
greeting
was
given
her
as
few
monarchs
have
received
the
abbey
had
been
filled
long
before
rich
strains
of
music
were
coming
from
the
organ
there
was
a
moment
silence
then
the
silver
trumpets
of
the
heralds
were
blown
and
the
church
resounded
with
handel
march
from
the
occasional
oratorio
the
queen
entered
she
was
preceded
by
archbishops
bishops
and
deans
all
in
the
most
elaborate
vestments
of
their
offices
the
guard
of
royal
princes
walked
slowly
up
the
nave
three
abreast
the
prince
of
wales
and
his
two
brothers
coming
last
slowly
the
queen
to
whom
all
the
world
was
doing
honor
ascended
the
steps
of
the
throne
the
vast
assemblage
was
hushed
and
stood
for
a
moment
with
heads
bowed
in
reverence
a
short
simple
service
followed
of
praise
and
thanksgiving
then
her
sons
and
daughters
who
had
been
grouped
around
the
queen
came
forward
one
at
a
time
to
bow
before
her
and
kiss
her
hand
as
they
rose
she
gave
each
of
them
a
kiss
not
of
state
but
of
warm
motherly
affection
that
in
this
crowning
moment
of
her
career
could
not
be
satisfied
with
the
restrictions
of
ceremony
that
evening
there
were
fireworks
and
illuminations
in
all
the
principal
cities
england
shone
literally
from
shore
to
shore
for
a
beacon
fire
was
lighted
on
malvern
hills
and
in
a
moment
as
its
distant
gleam
shone
on
other
hills
other
beacons
blazed
till
from
land
end
to
the
shetland
islands
it
was
rejoicingly
written
in
letters
of
fire
that
for
fifty
years
the
realm
had
been
under
the
rule
of
a
pure
and
upright
womanhood
at
last
the
day
was
fully
ended
i
am
very
happy
said
the
queen
and
well
she
might
be
for
this
day
had
shown
her
that
she
was
sovereign
not
only
of
the
land
and
its
treasures
but
of
the
loving
hearts
of
her
subjects
chapter
xv
the
queen
and
the
children
there
had
been
only
one
drawback
to
the
queen
happiness
during
the
jubilee
rejoicings
and
that
was
the
poor
health
of
her
favorite
the
crown
prince
of
germany
in
the
procession
he
had
looked
superbly
well
and
strong
but
his
throat
was
giving
him
so
much
trouble
that
he
remained
in
england
the
rest
of
the
year
hoping
that
a
change
of
climate
would
do
him
good
everyone
loved
our
fritz
as
he
was
called
in
germany
both
his
own
countrymen
and
the
english
his
father
the
emperor
was
over
ninety
and
so
feeble
that
he
could
not
possibly
live
many
months
ever
since
that
summer
day
on
the
hills
of
balmoral
when
the
prince
had
given
the
sprig
of
white
heather
to
the
maiden
of
his
choice
the
queen
had
hoped
that
germany
would
unite
under
one
emperor
and
that
prince
frederick
william
would
become
its
ruler
the
german
states
had
united
and
it
was
clear
that
the
german
throne
would
soon
fall
to
her
husband
but
the
physicians
declared
that
his
disease
was
incurable
for
several
months
the
whole
world
watched
for
news
of
the
beloved
emperor
and
his
equally
beloved
son
early
in
the
emperor
died
and
queen
victoria
ambition
of
thirty
years
had
come
to
pass
her
daughter
was
empress
of
germany
but
it
was
a
sad
accession
to
a
throne
and
the
queen
forgot
all
about
her
ambitious
hopes
in
her
daughter
grief
and
her
own
hardly
a
day
passed
that
she
did
not
send
some
message
of
sympathy
to
the
sorrowing
wife
in
three
months
the
end
came
the
emperor
fritz
whose
sufferings
had
been
none
the
less
because
he
sat
on
a
throne
was
dead
his
son
the
frederick
william
victor
albert
who
had
given
his
young
uncles
so
much
trouble
at
the
wedding
of
the
prince
of
wales
now
wore
the
german
crown
but
the
queen
instead
of
rejoicing
in
her
daughter
being
empress
of
germany
could
only
try
as
best
she
might
to
help
her
bear
her
loneliness
no
one
whether
princess
royal
or
highland
cottager
ever
appealed
to
the
queen
for
sympathy
in
vain
she
was
always
especially
interested
in
the
sick
in
her
jubilee
year
the
women
of
england
made
her
a
present
of
and
she
gave
almost
all
of
it
to
found
an
institute
which
should
provide
trained
nurses
for
the
poor
in
their
own
homes
when
injured
soldiers
returned
to
england
she
was
never
weary
of
going
to
see
them
of
walking
down
the
long
rows
of
beds
saying
to
one
man
i
am
afraid
you
are
in
great
pain
to
another
england
owes
much
to
her
brave
soldiers
if
she
only
asked
where
were
you
wounded
or
looked
at
a
sufferer
with
that
peculiarly
sweet
smile
of
which
everyone
spoke
and
which
the
photographers
could
never
catch
he
was
content
some
of
the
hospital
patients
almost
believed
that
her
coming
would
cure
them
oh
it
does
hurt
so
sobbed
one
little
girl
in
a
ward
for
children
but
if
the
queen
would
only
come
and
see
me
i
know
i
be
well
perhaps
she
will
said
the
nurse
no
cried
the
little
one
she
went
right
by
the
door
somehow
word
was
carried
to
the
queen
that
a
little
girl
who
had
been
terribly
burned
was
crying
to
see
her
is
there
another
ward
that
i
have
not
visited
she
asked
yes
madam
answered
the
doctor
but
it
is
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
hospital
never
mind
replied
the
queen
i
will
go
and
see
the
child
after
this
visit
the
little
girl
who
had
been
so
honored
was
the
envy
of
all
the
other
children
as
she
told
over
and
over
her
story
of
the
royal
visit
she
came
down
just
to
see
me
said
the
little
one
the
doctor
told
me
she
did
she
put
her
hand
right
on
my
forehead
and
she
said
have
a
little
granddaughter
about
as
old
as
you
and
i
hope
you
will
soon
be
able
to
run
about
as
she
does
and
then
she
said
and
she
said
shall
come
to
see
you
again
i
wish
she
would
come
all
her
life
queen
victoria
was
fond
of
children
she
liked
even
the
little
boy
who
declared
stoutly
no
i
do
like
you
because
you
cut
mary
queen
of
scots
head
off
when
she
first
became
queen
she
always
managed
to
have
some
little
folks
staying
in
the
palace
as
visitors
and
the
ninth
child
of
her
own
family
was
just
as
welcome
as
the
first
in
all
the
displays
that
were
made
at
her
various
receptions
she
was
never
more
pleased
than
when
throngs
of
children
were
gathered
together
to
greet
her
she
knew
how
to
please
children
and
when
she
went
to
visit
a
school
for
boys
she
won
their
hearts
by
requesting
the
master
to
give
them
an
extra
week
holiday
she
never
could
bear
to
disappoint
a
child
one
day
when
she
was
driving
very
rapidly
she
caught
sight
of
a
little
boy
by
the
roadside
looking
much
grieved
because
he
had
tried
to
throw
a
bunch
of
flowers
into
her
carriage
and
it
had
fallen
into
the
road
drive
back
she
ordered
and
the
carriage
with
its
four
horses
and
driver
and
attendants
was
turned
back
will
you
give
me
those
pretty
flowers
she
asked
and
the
little
boy
with
tears
on
his
cheeks
suddenly
became
the
happiest
little
fellow
in
the
highlands
as
he
shyly
handed
her
the
rather
dusty
bouquet
the
children
of
the
balmoral
tenants
knew
that
she
would
never
forget
her
promises
and
if
she
said
a
toy
was
coming
to
them
at
christmas
it
was
as
sure
to
come
as
the
day
itself
when
the
little
daughter
of
the
minister
in
the
village
nearest
to
balmoral
was
born
the
queen
asked
that
she
might
be
named
alexandrina
victoria
for
herself
many
gifts
were
sent
to
the
little
namesake
but
perhaps
the
one
that
pleased
her
most
was
the
tall
sugar
ornament
from
the
birthday
cake
which
the
queen
herself
brought
over
to
the
home
of
the
tiny
damsel
and
presented
to
her
as
the
many
grandchildren
began
to
circle
around
queen
victoria
she
had
a
warm
corner
in
her
heart
for
everyone
she
always
wore
a
bracelet
with
a
place
for
a
miniature
and
here
the
picture
of
the
new
baby
was
put
to
remain
until
there
was
a
newer
baby
whose
little
portrait
should
take
its
place
the
numerous
grandchildren
and
were
taught
to
greet
her
with
the
utmost
respect
and
little
boys
who
could
hardly
walk
would
make
a
bow
to
her
or
kiss
her
hand
as
gravely
as
any
courtiers
there
the
ceremony
ended
and
the
good
times
began
of
all
the
groups
of
children
there
were
some
to
whom
she
was
especially
devoted
the
daughters
of
the
princess
alice
as
she
was
always
called
in
england
she
cared
for
almost
as
if
they
were
her
own
they
made
her
long
and
frequent
visits
and
little
as
the
queen
cared
for
handsome
clothes
she
saw
to
it
that
when
these
orphan
granddaughters
were
to
be
married
they
should
have
all
sorts
of
fine
apparel
and
many
beautiful
jewels
the
children
of
whom
she
saw
most
during
the
last
years
of
her
life
were
those
of
princess
beatrice
two
of
them
were
born
at
balmoral
first
a
little
victoria
eugénie
the
first
child
of
the
royal
family
born
in
scotland
for
three
hundred
years
the
tenants
felt
that
this
child
was
really
their
own
and
they
put
their
shillings
together
and
bought
her
a
very
handsome
cradle
they
were
all
invited
to
come
to
the
castle
and
see
the
baby
and
a
carriage
was
sent
for
any
who
were
too
feeble
to
walk
when
the
second
child
a
boy
was
born
craig
gowan
again
blazed
with
a
bonfire
the
pipers
played
and
all
the
people
on
the
estate
lighted
their
torches
and
marched
up
to
the
top
of
the
hill
for
a
dance
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
the
princess
beatrice
did
not
have
as
much
difficulty
in
managing
her
own
children
as
she
did
when
she
was
six
years
old
in
commanding
the
obedience
of
prince
frederick
william
of
germany
and
his
sister
she
is
said
to
have
gone
to
mcleod
declaring
indignantly
just
think
my
nephew
william
and
my
niece
elizabeth
will
not
do
as
i
bid
them
and
shut
the
door
and
i
am
their
aunt
are
they
naughty
one
little
grandchild
who
was
especially
dear
to
the
queen
was
the
son
of
her
son
leopold
who
died
so
suddenly
the
duke
of
albany
commanded
the
seaforth
highlanders
and
after
his
death
the
little
duke
was
looked
upon
as
their
commander
the
story
is
told
that
when
he
was
six
years
old
he
was
allowed
to
review
his
troops
very
seriously
he
set
about
it
wearing
a
uniform
made
just
like
that
of
the
tall
highlanders
he
had
been
carefully
taught
how
to
give
some
of
the
orders
and
he
piped
them
out
as
gravely
as
if
the
fate
of
a
battle
depended
upon
his
words
he
was
delighted
to
see
how
promptly
the
men
obeyed
him
and
he
felt
quite
like
a
grown
man
but
he
too
had
to
obey
as
implicitly
as
his
soldiers
and
when
he
made
a
boat
of
a
scrubbing
brush
belonging
to
a
tenant
and
it
floated
off
down
the
river
the
small
boy
was
taken
straightway
to
a
village
store
to
buy
another
and
pay
for
it
with
his
own
pocket
money
with
so
many
children
in
whom
she
was
interested
the
queen
might
well
have
been
forgiven
if
she
had
forgotten
a
few
of
them
at
christmas
but
such
a
thing
never
occurred
and
even
when
the
birthdays
came
around
they
were
never
overlooked
she
always
had
a
little
pity
for
her
own
lonely
childhood
and
she
was
very
fond
of
giving
her
children
and
grandchildren
feasts
and
entertainments
that
they
could
enjoy
together
dancing
bears
were
brought
to
windsor
to
perform
for
the
children
punch
and
judy
often
gave
them
a
merry
hour
and
once
at
least
a
monkey
was
commanded
to
appear
before
the
queen
with
his
owner
and
the
where
other
people
invited
the
queen
commanded
performers
were
very
ready
to
obey
for
besides
the
price
paid
them
by
the
palace
commissioner
the
queen
almost
always
made
them
a
personal
gift
of
money
or
jewelry
moreover
it
was
an
excellent
advertisement
for
them
to
perform
before
the
royal
family
among
other
performers
buffalo
bill
and
his
troupe
were
commanded
to
windsor
to
show
her
majesty
and
the
little
people
what
wild
life
on
the
plains
of
america
used
to
be
once
at
balmoral
the
queen
commanded
a
circus
to
perform
before
her
it
was
only
a
little
circus
and
the
proprietor
must
have
been
almost
overwhelmed
with
amazement
and
delight
but
he
made
ready
and
set
out
for
a
field
near
the
castle
the
battenberg
children
and
the
little
folk
from
the
other
two
castles
which
the
queen
had
built
near
balmoral
were
summoned
to
come
to
the
show
the
little
alexandrina
victoria
was
invited
and
word
was
sent
to
all
the
tenant
children
the
circus
began
the
children
were
happy
and
even
the
performing
donkey
did
so
finely
that
the
queen
wished
to
buy
him
unfortunately
he
was
only
a
borrowed
donkey
and
could
not
be
sold
but
after
this
fortunate
day
it
is
very
likely
that
whenever
he
entered
the
sawdust
ring
he
was
announced
as
donkey
in
special
to
her
majesty
the
queen
of
great
britain
and
ireland
and
empress
of
india
the
queen
was
never
bored
by
these
little
entertainments
for
with
all
her
dignity
she
had
as
her
husband
said
of
his
eldest
daughter
the
brain
of
a
statesman
and
the
heart
of
a
child
when
the
circus
came
to
balmoral
she
watched
it
for
two
long
hours
and
was
apparently
as
much
amused
as
her
small
grandchildren
and
when
the
and
his
monkey
were
at
windsor
the
queen
laughed
as
heartily
as
any
of
the
children
as
the
little
creature
tried
his
best
to
find
a
way
into
the
castle
when
the
queen
was
amused
she
was
very
much
amused
and
sometimes
she
found
it
as
hard
to
keep
from
laughing
outright
as
any
young
girl
one
who
was
present
describes
the
reception
of
an
embassy
from
one
of
the
oriental
countries
when
it
was
all
the
queen
could
do
to
keep
a
straight
face
on
the
english
side
everything
was
very
ceremonious
for
it
was
desirable
to
pay
special
courtesy
to
the
strangers
the
embassy
too
wished
to
show
extreme
respect
but
no
one
guessed
how
they
would
do
it
they
entered
and
after
making
all
sorts
of
strange
gestures
they
suddenly
bowed
themselves
apparently
as
men
struggling
with
acute
internal
pain
and
squeezed
their
hands
together
between
their
knees
the
queen
was
as
motionless
as
a
statue
her
face
becoming
more
and
more
grave
as
the
formalities
proceeded
the
moment
the
envoys
had
left
the
room
however
she
broke
down
and
laughed
till
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
but
i
went
through
it
she
cried
to
her
ladies
i
did
go
right
through
it
the
queen
was
no
less
kind
to
her
servants
than
to
children
but
just
as
her
children
were
taught
to
obey
her
so
her
servants
were
required
to
give
her
prompt
and
excellent
service
i
ca
afford
to
be
kept
waiting
she
would
say
whether
the
delinquent
was
a
servant
or
a
court
lady
if
i
am
to
get
through
my
work
i
must
have
my
moments
frittered
away
after
the
housekeeping
was
once
fully
in
her
own
hands
there
was
little
more
of
the
irregular
negligent
management
that
had
formerly
prevailed
everyone
employed
had
his
work
and
was
responsible
for
its
being
well
done
it
is
said
that
she
even
made
use
of
the
ancient
expedient
of
housekeepers
whose
dusting
has
not
been
properly
done
and
that
with
her
own
royal
forefinger
she
once
wrote
her
name
on
a
dusty
cabinet
the
next
day
the
dust
was
still
there
and
then
she
wrote
under
her
own
name
that
of
the
servant
who
was
in
fault
when
the
poor
girl
discovered
that
she
had
been
reproved
by
the
queen
of
great
britain
and
empress
of
india
she
was
so
overwhelmed
with
alarm
that
she
ran
away
it
is
a
pleasant
ending
to
the
story
to
know
that
the
royal
mistress
sent
for
her
to
come
back
the
queen
rule
was
very
strict
but
if
trouble
came
to
any
of
her
attendants
she
was
as
sympathetic
as
if
she
had
been
one
of
their
own
family
she
wanted
them
to
have
plenty
of
amusement
and
when
in
a
great
exhibition
was
going
on
in
london
she
gave
to
her
balmoral
servants
an
invitation
to
spend
ten
days
at
windsor
castle
to
see
the
exhibition
and
the
other
sights
of
the
city
the
queen
demanded
the
best
of
service
but
when
it
was
given
she
never
felt
that
money
alone
would
pay
for
it
and
she
was
honestly
grateful
to
those
who
served
her
well
she
had
to
meet
so
many
strangers
that
it
was
a
pleasure
to
her
to
have
familiar
faces
in
her
household
when
new
attendants
were
to
be
employed
she
was
always
glad
to
have
members
of
the
families
that
already
served
her
and
at
the
death
of
john
brown
she
gave
his
place
to
one
of
his
cousins
who
was
already
in
her
employ
when
her
servants
were
ill
or
unable
to
work
she
always
cared
for
them
and
saw
to
it
that
they
had
a
comfortable
home
for
their
old
age
the
life
of
the
queen
was
gradually
becoming
very
regular
in
some
respects
and
especially
in
the
way
that
she
divided
her
year
for
a
long
time
she
had
made
two
visits
to
balmoral
each
year
one
in
the
spring
and
one
in
the
autumn
she
made
also
three
visits
to
osborne
and
spent
a
week
or
more
in
london
the
rest
of
her
time
was
given
to
windsor
and
to
her
vacation
which
she
spent
somewhere
on
the
continent
it
is
hardly
fair
to
say
that
she
had
a
vacation
for
wherever
she
went
one
of
her
ministers
accompanied
her
and
the
dispatch
boxes
followed
her
at
balmoral
the
messenger
arrived
about
six
every
morning
with
his
box
of
papers
these
were
arranged
by
the
secretary
in
such
a
way
as
to
save
her
all
unnecessary
trouble
about
ten
she
entered
upon
the
government
business
of
the
day
reading
thinking
signing
papers
and
writing
at
two
the
messenger
set
out
for
london
but
this
was
not
all
her
work
with
the
pen
for
the
royal
family
carried
on
a
vast
amount
of
correspondence
with
the
queen
as
nearly
as
possible
she
wished
to
hear
from
each
one
of
them
every
day
not
the
kind
of
letter
that
says
i
am
well
and
hope
you
are
the
same
but
letters
that
told
what
the
writers
were
doing
and
what
they
thought
of
the
events
in
which
they
took
part
the
queen
could
not
answer
all
these
communications
of
course
but
if
there
was
need
of
her
advice
or
sympathy
she
never
failed
to
write
and
those
of
her
letters
that
have
been
made
public
are
charmingly
frank
and
sincere
and
full
of
most
tender
affection
her
own
marriage
had
been
so
happy
that
in
the
marriage
of
her
descendants
she
paid
little
attention
to
whether
a
proposed
alliance
would
be
of
advantage
to
the
kingdom
the
chief
question
in
her
mind
was
whether
the
young
people
would
be
happy
together
two
years
after
the
jubilee
the
eldest
daughter
of
the
prince
of
wales
married
the
duke
of
fife
according
to
english
custom
the
daughter
of
a
prince
is
not
a
peer
but
a
commoner
and
although
a
title
is
usually
given
her
it
is
only
by
courtesy
and
not
by
right
the
princess
louise
then
was
a
commoner
but
by
marrying
a
duke
she
became
a
duchess
and
would
have
the
right
to
precede
her
sisters
if
they
did
not
also
marry
dukes
or
men
of
higher
rank
one
other
privilege
that
she
acquired
was
that
if
she
was
accused
of
any
crime
she
could
demand
to
be
tried
by
a
jury
composed
of
peers
in
came
the
fiftieth
anniversary
of
queen
victoria
marriage
her
golden
wedding
as
her
children
tenderly
called
the
day
they
gave
her
a
prayer
book
in
which
was
written
a
stanza
given
them
by
tennyson
remembering
him
who
waits
thee
far
away
and
with
thee
mother
taught
us
first
to
pray
accept
on
this
your
golden
bridal
day
the
book
of
prayer
through
the
sorrowful
memories
that
thoughts
of
her
own
wedding
aroused
the
queen
was
looking
forward
with
much
pleasure
to
a
marriage
that
she
hoped
would
take
place
next
to
the
sovereign
herself
and
the
prince
of
wales
the
interest
of
the
english
centered
upon
prince
eddie
the
duke
of
clarence
and
avondale
for
after
his
father
he
would
wear
the
english
crown
and
the
whole
country
was
waiting
to
see
whom
he
would
choose
for
his
wife
princess
mary
of
cambridge
who
had
always
been
a
warm
friend
of
princess
alexandra
had
married
the
duke
of
teck
their
daughter
mary
was
the
choice
of
the
duke
of
clarence
and
late
in
the
engagement
was
announced
only
a
month
passed
before
the
duke
was
taken
ill
and
in
a
few
days
he
died
there
was
a
deep
and
general
mourning
for
prince
eddie
was
greatly
loved
but
to
the
queen
there
was
the
loss
not
only
of
the
first
child
of
her
son
but
of
the
heir
to
her
crown
she
wrote
to
tennyson
was
there
ever
a
more
terrible
contrast
a
wedding
with
bright
hopes
turned
into
a
funeral
the
english
people
grieved
for
the
loss
of
prince
eddie
whom
tennyson
called
so
princely
tender
truthful
reverent
pure
and
they
were
sad
for
the
young
princess
princess
may
as
she
was
always
called
for
her
merry
disposition
and
good
heart
had
made
her
a
general
favorite
she
said
of
herself
that
when
she
was
a
child
she
was
very
naughty
very
happy
and
very
uninteresting
but
the
people
who
knew
her
did
not
agree
that
she
was
either
naughty
or
uninteresting
she
and
the
children
of
the
prince
of
wales
were
old
playfellows
and
the
best
of
friends
time
passed
on
and
it
began
to
be
whispered
that
a
marriage
would
take
place
between
princess
may
and
prince
george
the
second
son
of
the
prince
of
wales
he
was
now
the
heir
to
the
throne
and
the
people
were
glad
that
princess
may
would
some
day
become
their
queen
prince
george
or
the
duke
of
york
had
spent
some
years
of
his
life
at
sea
for
before
he
was
twelve
years
old
he
entered
the
navy
the
other
midshipmen
were
on
the
watch
to
see
whether
he
would
put
on
airs
because
he
was
the
prince
of
wales
son
but
he
soon
showed
himself
ready
to
take
part
in
whatever
came
up
and
no
more
favor
was
shown
him
than
to
any
other
young
sailor
like
his
uncle
the
duke
of
edinburgh
he
was
called
the
sailor
prince
after
his
marriage
to
princess
may
had
taken
place
and
the
young
pair
were
on
their
way
to
sandringham
they
found
arches
built
over
the
road
and
on
one
was
god
bless
our
sailor
prince
a
loss
which
in
her
daily
life
touched
the
queen
even
more
nearly
than
that
of
the
duke
of
clarence
was
that
of
prince
henry
of
battenberg
in
the
africans
of
ashanti
revolted
against
british
rule
and
forces
were
sent
to
suppress
them
prince
henry
wished
to
serve
i
have
been
brought
up
as
a
soldier
he
said
and
now
is
my
time
to
show
what
i
can
do
the
queen
was
not
willing
to
have
him
go
but
he
did
not
give
up
england
is
my
adopted
country
he
urged
i
belong
to
her
regular
army
and
i
ought
to
help
protect
her
interests
and
for
the
sake
of
my
children
i
ought
to
establish
my
position
even
the
princess
beatrice
could
not
deny
that
this
was
true
and
at
last
the
queen
yielded
the
service
of
the
prince
was
short
for
not
many
weeks
after
reaching
africa
he
was
sent
home
ill
of
fever
and
died
on
the
voyage
the
queen
suffered
with
her
daughter
for
the
bright
merry
ways
of
the
prince
had
been
a
real
delight
to
her
i
have
lost
the
sunbeam
of
my
household
she
said
sadly
one
by
one
she
was
losing
those
who
were
dear
to
her
but
in
every
trouble
the
love
of
her
subjects
was
her
great
comfort
and
this
love
was
soon
to
be
manifested
even
more
clearly
than
at
the
jubilee
of
chapter
xvi
the
closing
years
one
autumn
day
in
vast
numbers
of
telegrams
were
sent
to
queen
victoria
not
only
from
the
english
colonies
but
from
almost
all
the
countries
of
the
world
they
were
full
of
congratulations
on
the
length
of
her
reign
for
now
she
had
been
on
the
throne
longer
than
any
other
english
ruler
and
longer
than
any
one
who
had
ever
ruled
on
the
continent
except
louis
xiv
no
european
monarch
who
had
been
on
the
throne
at
her
accession
or
even
ten
years
after
her
accession
was
still
reigning
she
had
seen
change
of
government
assassination
revolution
in
other
kingdoms
but
the
monarchy
in
england
had
stood
firm
and
was
much
stronger
than
when
she
became
queen
illustration
her
majesty
queen
victoria
a
photograph
by
england
would
not
permit
such
an
event
as
this
to
pass
without
a
celebration
preparations
for
the
diamond
jubilee
to
mark
sixty
years
of
sovereignty
were
commenced
many
months
before
the
time
appointed
more
than
a
million
strangers
were
expected
to
be
in
london
during
the
two
weeks
of
the
festivities
and
the
began
to
plan
how
to
feed
them
foods
were
brought
thousands
of
miles
and
fields
of
vegetables
were
bought
before
they
were
planted
next
to
something
to
eat
the
visitors
would
wish
for
a
place
to
see
and
owners
of
houses
standing
on
the
route
to
be
taken
by
the
procession
expected
to
get
more
for
a
single
window
than
the
usual
rent
of
a
house
for
a
year
the
tenants
of
these
houses
were
given
notice
to
quit
and
as
the
time
drew
near
those
who
refused
to
leave
were
put
out
by
force
these
removals
were
called
jubilee
evictions
not
everybody
was
busy
with
plans
for
there
was
an
enormous
amount
of
decorating
going
on
was
everywhere
and
in
all
sorts
of
materials
from
cut
glass
and
gold
to
red
calico
there
were
roses
lions
crowns
unicorns
wreaths
banners
and
pictures
of
the
queen
at
every
turn
the
route
which
the
procession
was
to
follow
wound
past
the
homes
of
the
poor
as
well
as
those
of
the
rich
and
even
the
poorest
found
means
to
brighten
the
dingiest
abode
with
a
bit
of
color
as
june
drew
near
troops
from
every
british
colony
began
to
be
seen
in
the
streets
of
london
uniforms
of
red
white
yellow
brown
green
blue
and
all
kinds
of
minglings
and
mixtures
decorated
the
city
there
were
so
many
chinese
africans
and
hindus
brown
people
yellow
people
and
white
people
from
every
part
of
the
world
that
one
might
almost
wonder
whether
there
would
be
room
in
the
streets
for
the
londoners
if
they
should
attempt
to
leave
their
homes
it
looked
as
if
it
might
be
a
little
difficult
to
leave
some
of
the
houses
for
scaffoldings
had
been
built
in
front
of
them
and
sometimes
even
far
above
the
roofs
so
that
as
many
seats
as
possible
might
be
rented
the
procession
was
to
follow
a
route
six
miles
long
and
so
many
high
scaffolds
had
been
raised
that
the
march
would
be
like
a
journey
through
a
canyon
whose
sides
were
all
aglow
with
every
kind
of
decoration
that
could
be
imagined
for
the
people
seemed
to
feel
that
the
brighter
their
hangings
were
the
more
loyal
they
were
showing
themselves
to
be
and
the
result
was
gorgeous
if
not
always
beautiful
in
the
colonies
the
day
was
being
celebrated
and
telegrams
of
loyalty
and
congratulation
were
coming
to
the
queen
by
the
score
as
she
passed
through
the
doors
of
buckingham
palace
at
eleven
she
sent
to
every
colony
the
message
from
my
heart
i
thank
you
my
beloved
people
may
god
bless
you
then
she
entered
her
carriage
and
passed
on
escorted
by
kings
princes
long
lines
of
seamen
masses
of
british
troops
and
masses
of
colonial
troops
the
long
cavalcade
went
on
slowly
to
temple
bar
the
old
entrance
to
the
city
there
the
queen
paused
and
the
thousands
in
line
paused
the
mayor
most
imposing
in
his
long
velvet
cloak
presented
her
with
the
sword
of
london
in
token
of
the
city
homage
she
touched
the
sword
in
acceptance
and
the
procession
moved
on
the
second
stop
was
at
paul
the
eight
horses
were
reined
up
before
a
superb
mass
of
color
and
glitter
for
on
the
steps
of
the
church
were
ambassadors
bishops
archbishops
judges
and
musicians
flashing
with
diamonds
gleaming
in
cloth
of
gold
gorgeous
in
the
red
blue
and
pink
hoods
of
the
universities
and
all
framing
in
a
great
square
of
little
prayer
was
offered
the
te
deum
was
chanted
god
save
the
queen
was
sung
and
thousands
of
people
wiped
their
eyes
as
they
joined
in
praise
god
from
whom
all
blessings
flow
the
benediction
was
pronounced
and
the
procession
turned
slowly
away
and
as
the
tread
of
the
horses
sounded
again
on
the
pavement
the
archbishop
forgot
his
magnificent
canonicals
he
forgot
everything
except
that
he
was
an
englishman
and
that
victoria
was
his
queen
and
he
led
the
whole
ten
thousand
people
in
three
tremendous
cheers
for
their
sovereign
that
night
everything
was
illuminated
that
could
be
illuminated
and
as
in
beacon
fires
flashed
from
hill
to
hill
and
from
headland
to
headland
the
prince
of
wales
suggested
that
the
best
memorial
of
the
day
would
be
a
general
subscription
to
pay
the
debts
of
the
principal
hospitals
and
in
a
great
sweep
of
generosity
was
promptly
subscribed
the
princess
of
wales
wrote
to
the
lord
mayor
of
london
expressing
her
interest
in
the
poor
of
the
city
and
gifts
amounting
to
were
made
at
once
for
their
benefit
the
rejoicing
went
on
for
a
fortnight
there
were
reviews
of
soldiers
and
of
battleships
there
were
concerts
exhibitions
and
dinners
for
the
poor
one
part
of
the
celebration
was
the
manufacture
of
a
mammoth
cake
by
the
same
firm
that
made
the
coronation
cake
this
jubilee
cake
weighed
five
hundred
pounds
and
five
hundred
more
was
added
to
it
in
frosting
and
sugar
ornaments
around
it
was
a
great
wreath
of
sugar
roses
a
lofty
tower
of
sugar
rose
from
within
the
wreath
with
many
monograms
medallions
crowns
lions
unicorns
angels
of
fame
and
of
glory
blowing
great
sugar
trumpets
and
at
the
very
top
was
the
angel
of
peace
with
white
and
shining
wings
it
would
have
been
a
source
of
deep
happiness
to
the
queen
if
peace
could
have
prevailed
throughout
the
empire
during
those
last
years
of
her
life
but
in
war
arose
between
the
english
and
the
boers
of
south
africa
as
usual
she
hoped
to
the
last
that
there
would
be
no
war
but
when
she
saw
that
it
must
come
she
had
no
patience
with
the
least
delay
in
sending
troops
and
she
urged
the
army
so
that
the
war
might
be
ended
as
soon
as
possible
she
was
not
satisfied
with
acting
through
others
she
wanted
to
do
something
for
the
men
herself
with
her
own
hands
and
she
set
to
work
to
knit
caps
and
comforters
to
be
sent
them
when
christmas
came
she
distributed
toys
and
candy
among
the
soldiers
children
and
remembering
that
men
are
only
boys
grown
tall
she
sent
boxes
of
chocolate
to
her
soldiers
at
the
front
when
the
wounded
and
the
ill
were
brought
home
she
often
went
to
the
hospitals
and
she
had
many
convalescents
come
to
visit
her
at
windsor
in
this
african
war
the
irish
troops
had
shown
such
bravery
that
the
heart
of
the
queen
was
completely
won
she
said
to
her
ministers
i
have
decided
to
pay
a
visit
to
ireland
to
thank
those
brave
irishmen
the
ministers
were
delighted
to
have
her
make
the
visit
but
they
remembered
that
she
had
not
been
in
ireland
for
forty
years
and
that
the
irish
felt
they
had
little
reason
to
love
the
english
government
it
will
be
only
wise
to
have
an
escort
of
cavalry
around
your
carriage
they
suggested
no
she
answered
i
am
their
queen
and
they
are
my
people
if
i
showed
any
distrust
of
them
they
would
think
i
deserved
to
be
afraid
of
them
published
a
picture
of
hibernia
kissing
the
hand
of
the
sovereign
and
saying
sure
your
majesty
there
no
place
like
home
and
it
at
home
you
be
with
us
the
queen
was
right
in
trusting
herself
without
fear
to
the
people
of
ireland
for
however
they
might
feel
toward
the
english
government
they
would
show
nothing
but
respect
to
the
english
queen
who
had
made
herself
the
guest
of
their
country
she
landed
at
kingstown
and
was
received
with
all
due
form
by
the
lord
lieutenant
of
ireland
but
the
more
ceremonious
reception
was
awaiting
her
at
dublin
where
elaborate
preparations
had
been
made
the
lord
mayor
and
the
other
officials
of
the
city
were
all
in
their
long
red
robes
heavily
trimmed
with
fur
attendants
in
black
velvet
and
silver
lace
followed
them
one
holding
a
great
basket
of
flowers
high
up
so
that
all
the
people
could
see
it
a
table
richly
draped
with
silk
was
placed
before
the
mayor
on
the
table
was
a
blue
satin
cushion
and
on
the
cushion
was
a
golden
casket
the
casket
was
lined
with
silk
strewn
with
shamrocks
embroidered
in
blue
and
in
the
casket
were
the
keys
of
the
city
and
an
address
to
the
sovereign
of
course
these
were
not
real
keys
of
a
real
gate
for
dublin
has
no
gates
but
in
order
to
carry
out
the
interesting
old
ceremony
tall
gates
and
towers
of
painted
canvas
had
been
erected
and
as
the
queen
and
her
escort
drew
near
a
trumpeter
from
the
highest
watchtower
blew
three
resounding
blasts
and
cried
the
athlone
pursuivant
is
at
the
gates
with
what
message
does
he
come
asked
the
lord
mayor
he
is
the
bearer
of
a
request
from
the
queen
of
great
britain
and
ireland
replied
the
trumpeter
he
may
enter
the
pursuivant
entered
and
the
lord
mayor
demanded
with
what
message
do
you
come
to
the
gates
of
the
city
of
dublin
i
bear
the
request
of
the
queen
of
great
britain
and
ireland
that
she
may
enter
her
city
of
dublin
he
replied
open
the
gates
and
admit
the
queen
of
great
britain
and
ireland
commanded
the
lord
mayor
the
pursuivant
galloped
back
the
gates
were
flung
wide
open
the
household
cavalry
dashed
through
and
then
came
the
queen
the
lord
mayor
presented
the
beautiful
casket
and
made
his
address
the
queen
handed
him
a
written
reply
the
lady
mayoress
presented
the
basket
of
flowers
and
the
queen
had
been
formally
received
as
the
guest
of
the
nation
this
visit
to
ireland
was
one
of
the
queen
vacations
but
it
was
hardly
a
restful
time
for
she
visited
hospitals
orphan
asylums
schools
and
convents
she
received
delegations
of
nurses
and
doctors
and
entertained
the
prominent
people
of
the
country
she
went
to
the
zoölogical
gardens
and
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
baby
bear
and
two
baby
lions
who
were
just
as
cross
as
if
she
had
not
been
their
lawful
sovereign
she
took
drives
about
the
city
and
the
country
she
reviewed
troops
and
finally
she
accepted
an
invitation
to
review
thirty
thousand
school
children
in
this
review
she
was
much
amused
when
one
small
child
called
out
sure
you
a
nice
old
lady
one
school
was
delayed
but
in
order
not
to
disappoint
the
children
the
queen
arranged
a
little
reception
for
them
later
in
the
day
the
visit
to
ireland
had
given
the
queen
pleasure
but
the
continued
fighting
with
the
boers
was
a
grief
to
her
and
in
the
summer
of
she
had
to
meet
trouble
that
touched
her
even
more
nearly
in
the
death
of
her
son
alfred
duke
of
connaught
the
duchy
of
had
asked
him
to
become
its
ruler
and
the
duke
of
albany
had
been
appointed
his
successor
this
duke
of
albany
who
had
reviewed
his
regiment
of
highlanders
when
he
was
six
years
of
age
was
now
sixteen
and
in
two
years
more
he
would
sit
on
a
throne
so
the
years
of
the
queen
passed
on
with
their
joys
and
sorrows
her
visit
to
ireland
took
place
in
for
four
or
five
years
previous
to
this
date
she
had
suffered
so
much
from
rheumatism
that
it
was
hard
for
her
to
walk
and
in
the
house
she
was
generally
moved
about
in
a
wheeled
chair
the
door
of
her
special
car
was
widened
so
that
the
chair
could
be
taken
in
easily
two
years
before
going
to
ireland
her
eyes
began
to
trouble
her
use
black
ink
and
a
broad
pen
were
the
instructions
she
gave
to
her
ministers
but
even
though
her
sight
grew
faint
she
would
not
lay
down
the
task
that
she
felt
was
her
own
toward
the
end
of
she
seemed
less
strong
than
usual
you
must
save
yourself
in
every
possible
way
ordered
the
physicians
and
you
must
not
write
more
than
is
absolutely
necessary
christmas
was
near
but
this
year
her
greetings
to
each
member
of
her
family
were
written
for
her
letters
and
telegrams
were
read
to
her
but
her
interest
in
all
matters
was
as
strong
as
ever
and
her
judgments
were
as
rapid
and
sagacious
she
met
lord

last
salute
this
was
the
farewell
of

that
night
the
yacht
with
its
precious
burden
lay
quietly
in

and
in
the
morning
the
body

placed
on
the
train
to
be
carried
to

houses
that
so
lately
had
been
all
aglow
with
the
colors
of
gladness
were
now
draped
with
purple
and
white
throngs
were
in
the
streets
but
they
stood
in
perfect
silence
the
men
bareheaded
and
every
woman
with
some
badge
of
mourning
slowly
the
was
drawn
through
the
city
followed
first
by
the
two
sons
of
the
queen
with
the
german
emperor
then
by

also
present
in
a
guard
of
honor
of
sailors

it
was
they
who
were
called
upon
to
perform
a
last
service
for
their
queen
at
windsor
the
horses
of
the
had
become
uneasy
and
in
a
moment
with
hardly
a
word
of
command
they
were
unharnessed
and
the
sailors
themselves
drew
the
to
the
castle
that
afternoon
the
funeral
rites
were
observed
in
george
chapel
with
words
of
prayer
and
the
strains
of
music
that
the
queen
herself
had
chosen
the
herald
made
solemn
proclamation
that
queen
victoria
was
dead
and

the
beautiful
mausoleum
at
frogmore

she
had
erected
for

albert
nearly
forty
years
before
muffled
drums
were
beaten
sad
sweet
funeral
marches
were
played
by
the
martial
bands
and
so
through
the
long
avenues
lined
with
soldiers
the
procession
moved
onward
at
frogmore
the
bands
were
hushed
and
the
highland
pipers
walking
before
the
coffin
played
the
weird
mournful
strains
of
the
lament
of
the
black
watch
prayer
was
said
earth
from
the
mount
of
olives
was
dropped
softly
upon
the
coffin
and
the
queen
was
laid
to
rest
beside
her
beloved
prince

morning
the
flowers
were
faded
the
flags
were
no
longer
at
the
stores
and
offices
were
opened
and
life
went
on
as
before
but
in
the
homes
of
england
those
who
had
known
and
loved
the
queen
were
talking
of
her
tenderly
and
thoughtfully
she
always
did
what
she
believed
was
right
said
some
she
was
always
sorry
for
those
who
suffered
said
others
and
some
repeated
reverently
the
words
of
the
scottish
pastor
who
had
known
her
so
well
i
admire
her
as
a
woman
love
her
as
