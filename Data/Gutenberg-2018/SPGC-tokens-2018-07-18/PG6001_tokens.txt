chapter
i
the
farm
in
pebbly
pit
polly
sounded
musically
from
the
direction
of
the
kitchen
doorway
in
a
and
reached
polly
brewster
as
she
knelt
beside
her
pet
in
the
barn
run
outside
and
see
what
maw
wants
poll
said
brewster
who
was
working
faithfully
over
the
object
of
polly
solicitous
devotion
obediently
polly
ran
out
and
shaded
her
eyes
as
she
gazed
across
the
great
depression
of
the
volcanic
crater
which
had
made
such
a
wonderful
farm
for
the
brewsters
at
the
door
of
the
long
squat
homestead
stood
brewster
waiting
for
an
answer
the
moment
she
saw
polly
she
called
ready
all
right
shouted
the
girl
waving
her
to
signify
she
had
heard
the
message
brewster
returned
to
the
kitchen
and
polly
went
back
to
her
father
side
he
glanced
up
as
she
entered
the
barn
and
polly
replied
to
his
questioning
look
maw
said
dinner
ready
well
ah
reckon
noddy
all
right
now
poll
said
the
rancher
as
he
stood
up
to
stretch
his
tired
muscles
i
felt
sure
she
would
be
paw
returned
polly
positively
if
only
jeb
was
about
now
ah
could
leave
him
with
noddy
with
directions
about
the
medicine
till
get
back
from
dinner
mused
brewster
standing
in
the
doorway
to
look
about
for
jeb
why
daddy
do
you
suppose
i
leave
noddy
with
jeb
for
a
single
moment
and
just
as
we
saved
her
life
too
i
reckon
not
i
stop
here
myself
and
watch
her
declared
polly
with
finality
as
she
assumed
the
post
vacated
by
her
father
and
held
the
little
fuzzy
head
upon
her
knees
sam
brewster
smiled
as
he
watched
polly
bend
over
her
pet
and
whisper
affectionately
in
the
long
sensitive
ear
poll
jeb
will
shore
say
you
used
witchcraft
on
the
burro
he
said
noddy
was
done
for
being
buried
under
that
slide
the
way
she
was
noddy
have
been
done
for
if
jeb
had
had
her
in
charge
but
she
just
could
refuse
to
live
with
me
right
here
calling
her
back
you
know
she
loves
me
so
she
had
to
listen
to
my
voice
explained
polly
with
suspicious
moisture
in
her
big
blue
eyes
ah
reckon
that
it
poll
love
works
wonders
if
we
only
it
and
you
love
everything
in
a
way
that
everything
loves
you
back
again
it
beats
me
how
the
beavers
and
foxes
and
even
the
bears
treat
you
as
if
you
were
one
of
them
instead
of
running
to
cover
as
for
the
chicks
and
colts
and
lambs
on
the
ranch
why
they
follow
you
to
oak
creek
if
they
could
polly
smiled
happily
as
she
looked
away
over
the
distant
where
nature
creatures
roamed
unrestrained
and
then
her
eyes
rested
upon
the
pastures
nearer
home
where
the
farm
pets
grazed
every
one
of
them
wild
or
tame
were
her
friends
reckon
ah
go
now
poll
what
shall
maw
do
about
the
dinner
tell
her
not
to
bother
about
me
i
wash
the
dishes
when
i
get
back
daddy
so
brewster
started
for
the
house
and
polly
settled
herself
in
a
more
comfortable
position
while
crooning
to
little
noddy
as
she
sat
holding
the
little
burro
head
her
thoughts
wandered
back
to
the
time
when
noddy
was
but
three
days
old
the
mother
had
died
and
left
the
tiny
bundle
of
brown
wool
to
be
brought
up
on
a
nursing
bottle
to
keep
the
baby
burro
warm
it
had
been
wrapped
in
an
old
blanket
and
placed
back
of
the
kitchen
stove
thus
noddy
first
learned
to
walk
in
the
large
kitchen
of
the
log
and
later
it
felt
quite
like
a
member
of
the
family
being
such
a
sleepy
little
colt
the
name
of
noddy
was
considered
very
appropriate
but
as
the
burro
grew
older
it
showed
such
intelligence
and
energy
that
its
name
was
a
dreadful
misnomer
noddy
considered
polly
her
particular
charge
and
followed
her
about
the
place
like
a
dog
and
when
the
burro
was
she
became
the
daily
companion
that
polly
rode
to
school
over
the
mountain
trails
or
about
the
farm
the
wise
western
burros
are
not
half
appreciated
by
folks
who
do
not
understand
their
unusual
intelligence
and
their
devotion
to
their
masters
they
will
seek
for
water
or
edible
herbs
when
lost
on
the
desert
or
mountain
peaks
and
sacrifice
life
to
save
that
of
the
rider
but
noddy
present
condition
was
not
due
to
sacrifice
most
of
the
horses
and
burros
at
pebbly
pit
showed
such
an
aversion
to
the
rainbow
cliffs
that
they
never
grazed
near
there
although
the
luxuriant
grass
made
fine
pasturage
these
cliffs
were
the
local
wonder
and
gave
the
farm
its
name
they
were
a
section
of
jagged
wall
composed
of
large
and
small
fragments
of
gorgeously
hued
stones
massed
together
in
loose
formation
like
shale
great
heaps
of
these
jeweled
fragments
which
crumbled
easily
from
the
cliff
lay
piled
up
along
the
base
of
the
wall
and
sparkled
brilliantly
when
the
sun
shone
upon
them
or
directly
after
a
rain
noddy
had
been
pasturing
out
the
night
before
her
accident
and
at
sunrise
found
herself
too
near
the
tabooed
cliffs
she
lifted
her
ears
suspiciously
wrinkled
her
nose
fearfully
and
wheeled
to
run
away
to
a
more
desirable
locality
but
in
that
quick
turn
she
loosened
the
shale
at
the
base
of
a
steep
descent
the
treacherous
rock
slid
and
threw
her
down
before
she
could
get
up
and
away
the
great
mass
rumbled
down
and
covered
her
but
she
finally
managed
to
work
her
head
free
for
breath
jeb
out
early
to
seek
for
stray
cattle
saw
the
fresh
slide
and
gazed
wonderingly
at
it
then
he
spied
the
nose
and
hoof
of
a
burro
protruding
from
the
shale
he
rushed
to
the
barn
where
he
had
left
brewster
and
in
a
short
time
master
and
man
had
the
tools
and
cradle
back
at
the
spot
and
noddy
was
soon
unearthed
she
was
unconscious
and
jeb
declared
it
was
useless
to
bother
with
a
burro
so
evidently
far
gone
even
brewster
feared
she
was
past
help
but
polly
insisted
that
noddy
must
live
all
that
morning
polly
sat
holding
the
limp
brown
head
while
whispering
words
of
affection
in
the
long
ears
and
who
will
say
that
instinct
did
not
respond
to
love
even
though
the
physical
sense
of
hearing
was
deaf
to
earthly
sounds
she
slowly
revived
and
was
resting
comfortably
when
the
came
for
dinner
brewster
returned
after
dinner
bringing
a
bowl
of
gruel
for
the
burro
and
jeb
followed
his
master
to
inquire
about
the
patient
jeb
help
me
feed
noddy
while
polly
runs
to
the
house
for
her
dinner
said
brewster
i
a
heap
rather
wait
here
and
help
with
noddy
paw
oh
polly
maw
told
me
to
say
there
was
a
letter
for
you
jim
melvin
stopped
off
with
our
mail
he
got
at
oak
creek
a
letter
who
can
it
be
from
asked
polly
wonderingly
that
what
you
must
find
out
it
looks
like
a
girl
writing
and
it
is
denver
who
do
you
know
there
replied
her
father
denver
why
nobody
i
run
and
see
who
it
from
cried
she
eagerly
and
brewster
smiled
at
the
success
of
the
ruse
to
get
his
daughter
away
for
a
time
polly
was
a
genuine
child
of
nature
her
life
of
little
more
than
fourteen
years
had
been
spent
in
the
mountains
surrounding
her
pebbly
pit
the
farm
was
oddly
located
in
the
crater
of
an
extinct
volcano
known
on
the
maps
as
the
devil
grave
like
many
other
peaks
scattered
about
in
this
region
of
colorado
the
volcanic
fires
had
been
dead
for
centuries
the
outer
rim
of
the
crater
formed
a
natural
wall
about
the
bowl
and
protected
the
rich
and
fertile
soil
of
the
farm
from
the
desert
winds
that
covered
other
ranches
with
its
fine
alkali
dust
the
snows
in
winter
lodging
in
the
crevices
of
the
cliffs
slowly
melted
during
the
progress
of
summer
thus
furnishing
sufficient
moisture
for
the
vegetation
growing
in
the
bowl
and
this
provided
splendid
pasturage
for
the
herds
of
cattle
owned
by
the
rancher
when
sam
brewster
staked
his
claim
in
this
crater
his
companions
jeered
at
the
choice
and
called
the
place
pebbly
pit
but
the
young
man
had
studied
agriculture
thoroughly
and
knew
what
he
was
doing
then
the
test
made
by
the
government
convinced
him
of
this
besides
his
denver
bride
preferred
the
beauty
of
the
spot
to
the
more
sociable
but
draughty
ranches
in
the
valley
of
bear
forks
river
so
they
settled
in
the
crater
and
named
the
farm
rainbow
cliffs
but
the
original
clung
and
gradually
the
owners
from
habit
also
came
to
call
their
place
pebbly
pit
in
the
mountains
where
the
government
gives
a
settler
all
the
timber
he
needs
transportation
is
so
difficult
and
paid
labor
almost
unknown
so
that
the
size
and
quality
of
a
rancher
house
and
expresses
his
character
sam
brewster
buildings
and
fences
were
as
solid
and
comfortable
as
any
in
the
state
he
and
his
wife
a
refined
young
woman
were
ambitious
and
energetic
so
it
was
not
surprising
that
they
succeeded
in
life
when
john
the
had
completed
his
studies
at
high
school
in
denver
he
was
sent
to
a
college
in
chicago
and
now
that
polly
seven
years
john
junior
had
finished
her
grammar
course
at
the
little
bear
forks
log
she
too
was
determined
to
enter
high
school
at
denver
sam
brewster
had
stubbornly
refused
to
consent
to
the
plan
taking
for
an
excuse
that
no
friends
or
relatives
remained
in
denver
where
polly
might
board
and
commutation
was
out
of
the
question
but
he
knew
and
so
did
his
wife
that
the
truth
of
his
refusal
lay
in
the
fact
that
he
could
not
bear
to
part
with
his
youngest
child
even
though
she
visited
at
home
each
brewster
sided
with
polly
ambition
and
planned
to
visit
her
old
home
in
denver
to
see
if
she
could
find
any
friends
who
would
prove
to
be
desirable
for
polly
to
associate
with
the
matter
stood
thus
this
lovely
june
day
when
the
unexpected
letter
arrived
the
very
unusual
occurrence
created
enough
interest
for
polly
to
take
her
mind
from
the
burro
so
she
ran
swiftly
towards
the
house
while
every
possible
correspondent
she
could
think
of
passed
through
her
thoughts
but
she
was
as
much
at
sea
as
ever
when
she
danced
up
the
log
steps
leading
directly
to
the
kitchen
maw
maw
where
are
you
is
there
really
a
letter
yes
from
denver
but
how
is
noddy
replied
brewster
coming
to
the
kitchen
door
holding
a
square
envelope
in
her
hand
dear
little
noddy
she
is
all
right
now
maw
but
it
looked
mighty
bad
a
bit
of
time
back
i
just
had
to
pray
and
with
all
my
might
maw
you
know
how
sighed
polly
taking
the
letter
from
her
mother
without
seeing
it
i
never
knew
how
i
loved
that
dear
little
bundle
of
fuzz
and
flesh
till
i
thought
she
was
dead
oh
i
am
so
glad
she
will
live
that
i
do
care
if
i
ever
eat
again
or
not
still
holding
the
precious
letter
polly
turned
back
to
look
at
the
barn
where
the
object
of
her
love
was
lapping
up
the
gruel
brewster
smiled
indulgently
at
her
intense
young
daughter
then
reminded
her
of
the
unopened
communication
dear
me
so
much
excitement
in
one
day
i
do
see
how
i
can
quiet
down
again
but
do
you
suppose
would
write
to
queried
polly
holding
the
envelope
at
arm
length
and
studying
the
i
not
clairvoyant
polly
so
suppose
you
open
it
and
see
for
yourself
laughed
brewster
well
i
hate
to
spoil
this
nice
stationery
but
here
it
goes
murmured
polly
severing
an
end
of
the
envelope
as
if
she
was
the
executioner
of
an
innocent
victim
see
who
it
from
polly
while
i
dish
up
your
dinner
of
course
you
do
care
whether
you
ever
eat
again
but
i
would
suggest
that
at
least
you
strive
to
ward
off
starvation
remarked
her
mother
teasingly
as
she
took
a
plate
from
the
oven
of
all
things
gasped
polly
as
she
read
the
letter
quickly
brewster
stood
waiting
to
hear
more
and
polly
gave
another
hurried
glance
at
the
signature
before
explaining
it
from
anne
stewart
the
girl
who
used
to
teach
at
bear
forks
school
that
time
the
teacher
got
sick
and
had
to
leave
for
a
few
months
you
know
the
pretty
one
with
the
blonde
hair
that
all
the
big
scholars
raved
over
announced
polly
oh
yes
the
one
that
you
said
was
so
happy
to
be
in
this
wonderful
country
yes
that
the
girl
well
guess
what
she
writes
me
and
polly
waved
the
written
sheet
above
her
head
polly
have
you
been
writing
to
her
about
high
school
hurriedly
asked
brewster
i
never
thought
of
that
maybe
we
can
plan
it
with
her
returned
polly
her
expression
changing
instantly
to
meet
the
new
suggestion
of
her
mother
well
time
enough
to
settle
that
question
now
tell
me
what
she
wrote
declared
brewster
sighing
with
relief
you
be
taken
right
off
your
feet
maw
so
you
best
sit
down
and
listen
advised
polly
nibbling
at
a
biscuit
while
she
waited
for
her
mother
to
be
seated
now
i
do
want
you
to
shake
your
head
or
say
a
word
until
i
all
through
reading
maw
it
something
terribly
surprising
and
goodness
only
knows
why
she
asked
i
was
so
young
when
she
taught
school
that
she
never
noticed
me
much
yes
you
were
much
younger
two
years
ago
and
you
are
so
very
ancient
now
retorted
brewster
trying
to
appear
serious
you
know
what
i
mean
but
this
is
reading
you
the
letter
and
i
know
just
how
you
gasp
when
you
hear
her
brother
listen
and
i
read
it
chapter
ii
a
momentous
letter
having
seen
that
her
mother
was
seated
and
ready
for
the
surprise
polly
read
dear
miss
polly
as
you
are
fast
reaching
the
where
girlhood
and
womanhood
meet
i
feel
i
must
address
you
with
the
prefix
that
dignifies
this
stage
of
your
life
although
i
seem
to
know
you
best
as
the
little
girl
whose
name
of
seemed
to
fit
her
exactly
perhaps
your
mother
will
be
surprised
that
i
did
not
write
this
letter
to
her
as
most
of
it
concerns
her
and
her
family
directly
but
i
can
best
explain
why
i
am
writing
to
you
by
the
following
my
brother
paul
and
your
brother
john
are
chums
in
college
you
know
and
i
heard
quite
recently
that
you
wished
to
prepare
for
high
school
in
denver
this
fall
when
a
friend
in
chicago
wrote
me
to
find
a
good
home
in
the
mountains
near
denver
where
i
can
stay
with
and
tutor
his
daughters
during
the
summer
i
thought
of
the
region
about
bear
forks
having
been
there
myself
i
know
how
wonderful
the
country
and
climate
are
if
your
mother
and
yourself
think
well
of
my
proposition
i
know
i
can
help
you
a
great
deal
also
towards
preparing
you
for
high
school
as
i
will
have
to
devote
a
short
time
each
day
this
summer
in
keeping
eleanor
up
in
her
studies
last
year
eleanor
and
barbara
maynard
of
chicago
came
to
board
with
us
in
denver
these
girls
are
acquainted
with
paul
and
john
through
their
brother
who
is
a
of
the
boys
the
younger
girl
eleanor
who
is
your
age
had
been
very
ill
and
the
doctor
ordered
her
to
denver
because
of
the
wonderful
air
her
sister
who
is
about
my
age
accompanied
her
the
father
maynard
engaged
me
to
tutor
eleanor
or
nolla
we
call
her
during
her
stay
in
denver
as
she
was
backward
in
lessons
we
three
became
very
good
friends
and
when
the
girls
went
back
to
chicago
i
missed
their
companionship
very
much
i
had
a
letter
from
the
father
last
week
asking
me
to
find
a
mountain
resort
for
this
summer
where
he
could
send
the
girls
as
nolla
needs
the
invigorating
air
and
simple
life
of
the
rockies
she
is
organically
sound
but
not
strong
enough
to
stand
city
air
and
life
maynard
has
been
through
the
bear
forks
country
and
when
i
wrote
suggesting
a
ranch
there
he
immediately
wired
me
to
settle
the
matter
at
once
i
had
a
letter
from
the
mother
who
can
not
go
with
her
daughters
for
the
summer
so
she
asked
me
to
go
with
them
more
as
a
friend
and
adviser
than
as
a
tutor
my
expenses
will
be
paid
and
my
salary
for
tutoring
nolla
will
be
a
blessing
to
help
paul
through
his
third
year
term
of
the
college
course
i
know
your
brother
is
away
with
tom
latimer
on
some
practice
work
with
a
survey
crew
so
his
room
is
vacant
this
summer
then
too
i
was
told
by
john
that
you
had
a
small
spare
room
back
of
the
kitchen
so
that
three
girls
could
have
comfortable
quarters
if
by
any
chance
your
mother
would
consent
to
take
us
in
for
the
summer
i
could
help
you
with
your
preparatory
lessons
for
high
school
next
term
at
the
same
time
that
i
coach
nolla
and
i
will
agree
for
myself
and
the
two
girls
that
we
will
not
expect
any
other
than
your
usual
this
unexpected
request
may
meet
with
disapproval
and
refusal
by
your
family
but
do
not
let
one
of
the
causes
be
on
the
grounds
of
the
extra
work
we
might
create
because
we
do
not
want
any
fussing
whatever
but
we
do
want
to
be
treated
as
members
of
the
family
to
do
our
share
of
anything
that
needs
to
be
done
maynard
wishes
his
girls
to
live
in
the
outdoors
as
much
as
possible
so
we
will
not
be
in
your
mother
way
i
certainly
hope
your
father
and
mother
will
allow
us
to
come
and
i
can
promise
you
that
you
will
enjoy
these
girls
very
much
the
terms
are
of
no
consequence
maynard
said
as
he
is
ready
to
pay
anything
to
give
nolla
a
quiet
home
and
the
life
she
needs
i
trust
you
can
persuade
your
mother
to
try
us
at
any
rate
and
so
hoping
for
a
favorable
reply
to
this
letter
i
am
your
sincere
friend
anne
stewart
while
polly
read
the
letter
aloud
her
mother
thought
rapidly
she
had
the
picture
of
a
charming
girl
who
had
often
met
john
brewster
at
social
gatherings
during
the
term
she
taught
the
children
at
bear
forks
now
her
brother
paul
was
one
of
john
chums
at
college
perhaps
this
girl
had
visited
at
chicago
and
perhaps
john
had
visited
her
home
at
denver
but
he
had
never
said
a
word
about
it
it
was
very
evident
that
this
girl
had
an
intimate
acquaintance
with
the
at
pebbly
pit
and
this
knowledge
must
have
reached
her
through
john
hence
john
and
she
must
be
very
well
acquainted
john
would
doubtless
marry
some
day
but
his
mother
did
not
care
to
see
him
entangled
before
he
had
launched
his
bark
on
the
waters
of
his
ambition
if
he
was
touched
by
one
of
cupid
darts
to
fancy
himself
in
love
with
his
chum
pretty
sister
it
was
good
judgment
for
his
mother
to
know
all
there
was
to
be
known
about
the
girl
not
that
the
letter
confessed
this
state
of
affairs
but
the
mother
feared
that
such
must
be
the
case
for
who
could
resist
loving
her
handsome
clever
boy
maw
i
anne
stewart
is
perfectly
lovely
oh
yes
polly
so
i
believe
replied
brewster
in
an
manner
well
if
you
let
them
come
here
i
would
love
it
you
ca
judge
beforehand
polly
having
three
city
strangers
come
suddenly
to
live
at
a
ranch
where
city
manners
are
unknown
will
turn
things
you
know
but
you
see
maw
the
teacher
offers
to
help
me
with
lessons
so
i
can
pass
for
high
school
in
the
fall
polly
reminded
her
mother
i
can
do
as
much
for
you
dear
without
the
care
of
strangers
remonstrated
brewster
who
would
not
commit
herself
until
she
had
had
time
to
weigh
all
things
carefully
then
i
you
intend
refusing
this
request
pouted
the
disappointed
girl
i
wish
to
think
over
the
situation
most
wisely
before
we
reply
to
the
letter
now
finish
your
dinner
and
do
the
dishes
i
am
going
to
take
my
mending
to
the
side
porch
polly
did
as
she
was
told
but
her
imagination
strayed
to
denver
and
chicago
as
she
tried
to
picture
barbara
and
eleanor
maynard
with
anne
stewart
visiting
pebbly
pit
that
summer
meantime
brewster
considered
the
and
of
the
problem
if
this
anne
stewart
proved
to
be
the
sort
of
wife
john
needed
it
would
be
advisable
to
have
her
know
her
future
if
she
was
not
desirable
it
would
be
discovered
during
the
weeks
she
lived
under
the
same
roof
with
john
mother
but
should
it
transpire
that
there
was
no
cause
for
worry
about
john
and
this
young
teacher
she
would
still
prove
to
be
a
good
friend
for
polly
to
know
in
case
the
child
attended
school
in
denver
the
following
term
brewster
had
almost
decided
to
speak
favorably
to
polly
of
the
plan
when
the
girl
joined
her
on
the
porch
do
you
suppose
daddy
will
mind
having
so
many
young
folks
about
the
place
that
is
if
you
will
let
them
come
i
sure
your
paw
will
be
happy
to
give
you
pleasure
and
you
know
how
glad
he
is
to
have
young
people
visiting
here
rather
than
having
you
leave
home
to
visit
others
remarked
brewster
slowly
drawing
the
yarn
through
a
hole
in
a
sock
while
i
washed
the
dishes
i
wondered
if
he
would
say
anything
to
you
about
the
extra
work
the
three
girls
will
make
said
polly
trying
to
feel
her
mother
out
that
will
be
his
main
objection
i
think
he
had
planned
for
me
to
visit
my
old
friends
in
denver
this
summer
but
this
new
departure
will
make
it
impossible
for
me
to
be
away
from
here
oh
maw
if
you
want
to
go
away
do
let
these
girls
spoil
your
plans
cried
polly
contritely
i
really
had
not
thought
of
my
own
pleasure
in
visiting
old
friends
at
denver
polly
but
i
had
planned
to
see
about
your
residence
this
winter
should
you
attend
school
there
i
want
you
to
board
with
a
family
that
can
offer
you
the
proper
atmosphere
if
this
young
teacher
proves
to
be
nice
she
will
know
all
i
needed
to
find
out
about
the
school
and
a
boarding
house
and
i
will
not
have
to
leave
my
beloved
home
at
all
well
then
it
all
depends
on
what
daddy
will
say
cried
polly
joyously
i
do
wish
he
hurry
in
he
must
have
known
your
wishes
polly
i
see
him
coming
towards
the
house
laughed
brewster
polly
leaned
over
the
of
the
porch
to
watch
her
father
coming
nearer
and
nearer
then
when
she
thought
he
was
in
hailing
distance
she
shouted
daddy
do
hurry
and
hear
the
news
came
in
my
letter
and
the
missive
was
waved
back
and
forth
to
urge
the
rancher
to
greater
speed
brewster
reached
the
porch
and
whipped
off
his
wide
sombrero
to
mop
his
warm
forehead
well
maw
did
poll
tell
you
about
noddy
ah
tell
you
our
polly
is
some
doctor
all
right
as
the
rancher
chuckled
over
his
words
polly
felt
she
had
been
guilty
of
neglect
for
she
had
quite
forgotten
to
ask
how
noddy
was
brewster
smiled
as
she
continued
her
darning
who
with
noddy
now
did
you
give
jeb
careful
instructions
paw
anxiously
queried
polly
noddy
sleeping
as
peacefully
as
a
babe
so
need
worry
any
more
now
tell
me
all
about
the
wonderful
letter
sam
do
you
remember
that
young
lady
from
denver
who
took
miss
shalp
place
at
bear
forks
school
for
a
few
months
quickly
asked
brewster
the
note
of
anxiety
in
the
query
was
not
overlooked
by
the
rancher
but
he
answered
indifferently
to
all
appearances
shore
thing
wife
could
any
one
forget
such
a
nice
girl
in
a
hurry
well
sam
the
letter
from
her
anne
stewart
is
her
name
do
tell
him
what
let
me
read
it
maw
cried
polly
so
the
letter
was
read
again
and
the
moment
it
was
concluded
polly
and
brewster
looked
fearfully
at
brewster
for
they
both
expected
violent
objections
from
him
but
the
rancher
stood
boring
a
hole
with
the
toe
of
his
boot
down
through
the
soft
grass
sod
while
he
seemed
to
study
the
handiwork
after
a
few
moments
of
tense
silence
he
looked
up
and
laughed
heartily
who
have
thought
it
mary
you
young
looking
enough
to
pass
for
a
blushing
bride
but
having
a
son
old
enough
to
think
of
a
and
little
poll
here
trying
to
bamboozle
us
to
let
her
go
away
to
school
ah
well
polly
gazed
from
father
to
mother
and
back
again
what
has
john
got
to
do
with
this
letter
gracious
he
is
thinking
of
a
wife
i
hope
her
parents
laughed
at
her
perplexity
and
brewster
explained
satisfactorily
to
her
question
i
was
thinking
of
the
four
pretty
girls
we
have
at
the
ranch
all
summer
if
john
comes
home
to
choose
one
of
them
oh
daddy
then
you
have
them
come
cried
polly
at
the
same
time
jumping
at
her
father
to
throw
her
arms
about
his
neck
on
one
condition
yes
that
is
a
gal
to
do
the
chores
for
maw
so
she
can
look
after
such
a
handful
of
trouble
as
three
new
daughters
will
make
for
her
a
hired
girl
why
sam
how
you
talk
what
could
i
ever
do
with
help
in
such
a
small
house
besides
anne
stewart
says
they
will
help
with
the
work
objected
brewster
that
my
only
condition
you
not
going
to
slave
for
a
lot
of
city
girls
if
i
know
it
why
they
wo
know
how
to
hold
a
kitchen
knife
let
alone
cook
for
the
family
replied
brewster
i
agree
at
once
sam
because
i
know
there
is
a
girl
or
woman
to
hire
within
fifty
miles
of
oak
creek
laughed
brewster
then
polly
can
answer
the
letter
as
she
likes
and
i
will
hunt
up
a
gal
you
said
it
you
agree
to
hire
help
if
one
can
be
found
quickly
came
from
the
rancher
sam
you
took
this
occasion
to
have
your
own
about
hired
help
laughed
his
wife
shaking
her
head
deprecatingly
you
never
would
listen
before
but
now
you
got
to
said
brewster
triumphantly
polly
you
can
run
in
and
answer
that
letter
as
soon
as
you
like
hinted
brewster
and
the
girl
eagerly
obeyed
while
she
wrote
the
answer
over
and
over
till
it
met
with
her
approval
her
parents
exchanged
confidences
regarding
john
and
this
young
teacher
but
polly
never
dreamed
of
such
fears
the
letter
that
left
pebbly
pit
the
following
day
was
the
first
thread
woven
in
the
warp
and
woof
of
two
young
lives
eleanor
maynard
in
chicago
and
polly
brewster
in
the
rockies
had
the
reply
been
other
than
it
was
would
these
two
girls
have
met
and
experienced
the
interesting
schooldays
college
years
and
business
careers
that
they
enjoyed
through
becoming
acquainted
that
summer
at
pebbly
pit
chapter
iii
preparing
for
the
unknown
the
letter
sent
from
pebbly
pit
to
anne
stewart
was
forwarded
by
the
latter
to
the
maynard
girls
in
chicago
it
was
eagerly
read
aloud
to
maynard
by
barbara
reaching
the
paragraph
in
the
letter
where
brewster
asked
anne
stewart
if
she
thought
five
dollars
a
week
for
the
board
of
each
would
be
asking
too
much
barbara
dropped
the
sheet
of
paper
and
gasped
an
expression
of
incredulity
appeared
on
the
faces
of
the
mother
and
daughter
while
eleanor
laughed
outright
just
fancy
five
dollars
a
week
she
cried
throwing
herself
back
on
the
cushions
of
the
divan
it
must
be
a
mistake
i
trust
it
is
meant
for
fifty
a
week
that
is
about
the
price
a
good
hotel
would
charge
but
i
had
hoped
this
place
would
be
more
reasonable
however
i
am
quite
sure
that
figure
five
is
a
mistake
no
one
can
possibly
give
meals
at
that
rate
no
matter
how
meager
the
fare
may
be
declared
maynard
the
writing
is
plain
enough
and
so
is
the
figure
mother
returned
barbara
referring
again
to
the
letter
then
handing
it
to
her
mother
maynard
adjusted
her
lorgnette
and
studied
the
figure
given
it
seem
to
be
five
without
a
doubt
admitted
she
oh
well
it
really
does
matter
much
what
the
price
is
just
as
long
as
we
have
a
good
time
this
summer
exclaimed
eleanor
but
nolla
dear
it
does
matter
your
father
is
dreadfully
upset
about
our
plans
he
says
my
newport
season
will
cost
far
more
than
i
fancied
it
would
and
you
two
girls
going
to
a
mountain
resort
like
this
is
an
extra
cost
he
will
have
to
be
away
all
summer
on
important
business
connected
with
the
bank
and
will
cost
extra
money
altogether
he
feels
anything
but
indifferent
sighed
maynard
handing
the
letter
back
to
barbara
well
we
are
not
responsible
for
father
worries
over
the
loans
but
we
concerned
about
the
style
and
quality
of
meals
to
be
served
at
this
brewster
place
for
five
dollars
a
week
scorned
barbara
i
do
believe
anne
stewart
would
take
us
to
a
place
where
anything
was
horrid
and
cheap
she
knows
what
good
as
well
as
we
do
defended
eleanor
who
was
eager
to
go
to
this
mountain
ranch
nolla
is
quite
right
bob
anne
is
too
particular
to
engage
board
in
an
undesirable
house
or
hotel
added
maynard
besides
these
brewsters
have
a
farm
you
know
and
i
suppose
they
raise
lots
of
things
that
we
have
to
pay
such
awful
prices
for
eggs
chickens
butter
and
vegetables
added
eleanor
maynard
and
barbara
looked
with
admiration
at
the
young
girl
for
that
was
an
idea
they
had
not
thought
of
of
course
that
why
they
can
board
us
so
reasonably
then
too
i
suppose
they
do
their
own
marketing
for
other
items
of
food
such
as
delicacies
and
supplies
from
the
baker
it
does
make
a
difference
in
the
accounts
you
see
when
one
markets
ventured
barbara
glancing
at
her
mother
who
never
bothered
about
anything
connected
with
the
housekeeping
leaving
it
all
for
the
servants
to
do
now
bob
do
criticize
your
mother
methods
i
ca
drudge
about
the
house
and
take
charge
of
the
social
clubs
and
welfare
work
as
well
complained
maynard
of
course
not
bob
besides
mother
never
did
know
a
good
cut
of
beef
from
a
poor
one
they
never
taught
domestic
science
in
her
day
you
see
hurriedly
interpolated
eleanor
hoping
to
waive
a
scene
such
as
was
a
common
occurrence
between
barbara
and
her
mother
nolla
are
you
sarcastic
about
my
education
queried
maynard
with
dignity
mercy
no
i
only
tried
to
show
bob
the
difference
in
present
day
methods
and
the
past
maynard
entered
the
room
during
eleanor
reply
and
smiled
as
he
heard
his
youngest
daughter
frank
words
it
was
a
keen
pleasure
to
him
to
have
one
child
fearless
in
thought
and
word
his
son
and
elder
daughter
had
been
spoiled
by
fawning
tutors
and
companions
so
they
had
acquired
the
habit
of
facts
to
suit
the
needs
eleanor
had
been
too
delicate
to
attend
any
expensive
and
fashionable
seminary
and
being
taught
by
anne
stewart
while
in
denver
had
acquired
many
of
anne
splendid
ways
frederick
what
do
you
know
about
this
mountain
resort
you
asked
anne
stewart
to
write
about
asked
maynard
well
now
that
we
are
all
together
and
have
the
time
to
talk
this
matter
out
i
will
say
my
say
replied
maynard
seating
himself
and
drawing
eleanor
down
beside
him
upon
the
divan
you
remember
the
first
year
we
were
married
i
had
to
visit
bear
forks
to
investigate
a
loan
one
of
our
clients
at
the
bank
asked
us
to
make
on
a
tract
of
you
would
go
with
me
when
you
heard
we
would
have
to
camp
out
at
night
and
ride
horses
over
rough
that
is
the
season
you
visited
your
in
the
east
maynard
looked
at
his
wife
as
he
spoke
and
she
nodded
her
head
as
if
the
memory
was
not
pleasant
to
recall
her
husband
smiled
an
enigmatical
smile
and
continued
his
description
that
is
when
i
met
sam
brewster
and
his
wife
they
had
been
married
about
as
long
as
we
had
and
their
happy
struck
me
as
being
the
most
desirable
existence
i
ever
heard
of
maynard
lips
curled
in
silent
derision
she
understood
her
husband
yearning
for
a
simple
life
in
place
of
the
frivolous
and
empty
excitement
of
the
social
career
she
had
made
for
herself
and
family
the
country
about
the
sections
i
visited
is
beautiful
and
healthy
and
as
nolla
is
ordered
to
a
quiet
mountainous
region
for
a
time
i
know
of
no
place
so
suitable
besides
anne
stewart
has
been
there
too
and
she
is
wild
over
the
place
but
you
are
so
in
your
ideas
of
living
and
pleasures
father
and
i
want
to
know
if
this
place
will
suit
me
are
the
brewsters
members
of
the
best
set
there
or
will
i
be
left
absolutely
unaided
to
find
a
way
to
meet
young
people
such
as
we
would
like
to
know
asked
barbara
anxiously
the
brewsters
are
by
far
the
wealthiest
family
in
that
whole
section
of
country
and
i
have
heard
that
the
ranch
and
house
are
the
finest
in
the
state
you
met
young
john
brewster
at
the
college
prom
and
you
can
tell
what
you
think
of
young
brewster
is
all
right
every
one
seemed
to
think
he
is
exceptionally
nice
remarked
barbara
maynard
sighed
with
relief
as
she
felt
that
a
weight
had
been
lifted
from
her
mind
she
was
anxious
to
have
her
two
daughters
climb
the
social
ladder
to
a
higher
plane
than
she
had
been
able
to
reach
so
she
knew
they
must
be
careful
to
associate
with
only
those
who
had
already
arrived
there
through
forbears
or
ambition
then
we
can
wire
anne
at
once
to
complete
arrangements
frederick
ventured
the
lady
watching
her
husband
expression
i
attend
to
that
but
when
can
you
be
ready
to
go
asked
maynard
glancing
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
trio
the
same
day
you
start
daddy
declared
eleanor
giving
her
father
a
hug
why
we
simply
ca
nolla
father
leaves
chicago
next
week
and
we
have
so
much
to
prepare
before
going
to
a
place
where
we
are
apt
to
meet
the
very
elite
of
society
cried
barbara
it
will
take
fully
two
weeks
to
go
through
the
girls
wardrobe
frederick
and
see
that
everything
is
the
last
word
added
maynard
explanatory
of
her
eldest
daughter
dismay
well
fix
things
up
any
way
you
say
but
i
off
for
the
bank
when
you
begin
talking
dress
laughed
maynard
now
frederick
do
leave
us
like
this
you
know
we
will
need
money
to
fit
out
the
girls
and
then
you
have
some
idea
of
when
anne
can
expect
them
in
denver
hurriedly
said
maynard
as
her
husband
crossed
the
room
to
leave
daddy
i
do
want
another
thing
to
wear
i
got
so
many
things
now
that
it
makes
me
tired
to
keep
changing
to
suit
the
thousand
and
one
occasions
declared
eleanor
running
after
her
father
to
kiss
him
nolla
i
declare
you
will
never
grow
up
pray
like
a
lady
when
you
cross
a
room
wo
you
complained
barbara
eleanor
smiled
up
at
her
father
and
he
pinched
her
thin
cheek
as
he
stooped
to
kiss
her
then
he
waved
his
hand
at
the
others
and
left
the
room
once
outside
the
door
and
safely
out
of
hearing
he
chuckled
to
himself
bob
pictures
a
gay
resort
with
troops
of
male
admirers
to
play
tennis
and
dance
away
the
hours
with
she
is
thinking
of
dress
to
captivate
her
but
nolla
is
thinking
of
the
rural
pleasures
she
has
heard
me
describe
to
her
if
bob
knew
the
truth
she
never
go
and
poor
little
nolla
would
lose
the
most
wonderful
opportunity
of
her
young
life
i
best
not
prejudice
bob
or
mother
but
just
pay
the
bills
for
finery
and
whims
and
bide
my
time
soon
after
arriving
at
his
he
sent
a
message
to
anne
stewart
at
denver
advising
her
to
engage
the
rooms
at
the
brewster
home
as
an
afterthought
he
added
that
he
was
anxious
to
have
eleanor
get
away
about
the
time
he
left
home
for
his
trip
that
afternoon
he
carried
home
the
reply
from
anne
stewart
have
engaged
rooms
and
board
from
next
week
on
wire
when
to
expect
you
at
denver
anne
maynard
had
heard
from
her
friends
that
day
that
their
plans
were
changed
and
now
they
expected
to
leave
chicago
sooner
than
she
had
thought
this
made
her
agree
quickly
to
having
her
daughters
start
the
following
week
but
mother
it
ca
be
done
i
need
a
riding
habit
and
tennis
clothes
and
a
few
new
afternoon
gowns
and
evening
dresses
remonstrated
barbara
you
had
a
new
habit
last
fall
bob
eleanor
said
but
it
has
a
long
coat
and
full
bloomers
no
one
is
wearing
that
style
now
everything
is
mannish
coats
and
tight
knickerbockers
argued
barbara
i
will
call
up
the
tailor
at
once
girls
and
have
him
give
us
the
preference
over
other
work
maynard
replied
not
for
me
i
do
like
the
tight
habits
i
shall
take
my
bloomer
one
replied
eleanor
decidedly
dear
me
nolla
you
do
seem
to
care
a
fig
about
your
appearance
what
will
become
of
you
when
it
is
time
for
you
to
make
your
debut
sighed
maynard
despondently
i
not
going
to
do
anything
so
silly
i
going
into
business
when
i
grow
up
oh
nolla
mother
and
sister
could
hardly
gasp
the
words
as
they
turned
shocked
eyes
in
the
direction
of
maynard
who
had
been
writing
out
checks
for
his
family
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
laughed
heartily
at
the
independence
of
his
youngest
child
frederick
now
you
see
what
comes
of
your
petting
nolla
whenever
she
says
or
does
anything
dreadful
exclaimed
maynard
is
business
so
dreadful
then
anne
stewart
seems
all
right
and
she
is
earning
her
living
ventured
eleanor
i
wash
my
hands
of
you
after
this
eleanor
if
you
do
anything
so
unheard
of
as
you
threaten
no
one
will
keep
up
with
you
declared
barbara
sternly
they
have
to
travel
mighty
fast
to
keep
up
with
me
bob
once
i
am
of
age
and
start
in
business
laughed
eleanor
that
will
do
young
lady
remember
you
are
only
fourteen
and
business
is
a
long
time
off
for
you
maynard
remarked
then
eleanor
hung
over
the
back
of
her
father
chair
twisting
the
hair
into
ridiculous
points
while
her
mother
and
barbara
forgot
her
presence
and
planned
many
fetching
gowns
for
the
summer
campaign
both
were
fair
examples
of
modern
society
and
its
aims
and
they
sacrificed
many
plans
and
pleasures
upon
the
altar
of
their
fickle
goddess
so
it
followed
that
the
fashionable
tailors
the
modiste
and
the
stitched
and
fitted
and
clipped
on
beautiful
materials
and
trimmings
until
everything
was
ready
for
barbara
summer
victory
eleanor
steadfastly
refused
to
be
annoyed
by
having
new
clothes
made
so
her
trunk
was
packed
with
the
wardrobe
she
already
had
on
hand
of
course
nolla
appearance
is
not
of
as
much
consequence
as
yours
bob
as
she
still
is
so
young
and
delicate
it
is
different
with
you
however
and
i
so
glad
you
are
sensible
to
appreciate
what
a
difference
clothes
make
said
maynard
resignedly
as
the
seven
trunks
were
packed
and
waiting
for
the
expressman
i
glad
your
fussing
is
over
at
last
if
you
had
much
more
to
sew
and
fit
we
never
get
away
grumbled
eleanor
watching
the
man
stagger
as
he
carried
the
heavy
trunks
downstairs
well
i
soon
be
reaping
the
benefit
of
my
patience
and
be
sorry
you
were
so
indifferent
over
your
looks
retorted
barbara
turning
away
from
the
window
once
her
five
trunks
were
safely
on
the
express
wagon
girls
you
sure
everything
that
celeste
wrote
down
on
the
list
is
packed
your
complexion
cream
in
case
of
freckles
or
tan
and
the
shampoo
mixture
for
the
to
use
tell
him
i
never
allow
you
to
use
preparations
on
your
hair
yes
mother
all
the
toilet
articles
are
in
the
small
trunk
and
the
few
extra
things
were
packed
in
eleanor
trunk
because
she
had
a
corner
with
nothing
to
fill
in
it
explained
barbara
thank
goodness
we
can
eat
dinner
and
go
to
bed
without
being
served
styles
and
fits
sighed
eleanor
not
meaning
to
be
irreverent
at
her
mother
gospel
anne
stewart
had
not
mentioned
the
need
of
and
good
plain
clothing
in
her
letters
to
the
maynards
because
maynard
particularly
requested
her
to
delete
such
items
anne
was
bright
at
reading
minds
and
smiled
as
she
surmised
the
reason
for
the
restriction
she
knew
eleanor
would
glory
in
old
clothes
and
a
good
time
but
would
be
so
willing
to
visit
pebbly
pit
farm
if
she
knew
the
truth
about
the
environment
anne
single
steamer
trunk
was
filled
with
sensible
clothes
and
the
toilet
articles
she
knew
she
would
need
for
the
summer
then
she
wired
the
maynards
to
say
all
was
waiting
to
hear
from
them
and
barbara
wired
back
that
they
would
meet
her
at
the
denver
terminal
station
at
the
day
and
time
agreed
upon
meantime
great
preparations
were
under
way
at
pebbly
pit
john
room
had
to
be
cleaned
and
rearranged
for
the
young
ladies
while
polly
and
her
mother
planned
the
work
brewster
made
a
thorough
search
of
the
countryside
in
hopes
of
finding
a
suitable
for
his
wife
and
polly
most
ranchers
need
their
daughters
at
home
and
as
there
are
no
really
poor
or
families
in
those
farming
sections
the
task
of
finding
a
servant
was
not
an
easy
one
and
brewster
realized
what
it
meant
when
he
read
in
the
papers
how
difficult
a
problem
it
was
becoming
this
question
at
last
as
he
was
about
to
despair
of
ever
finding
any
one
he
stopped
in
at
the
oak
creek
post
office
to
see
if
there
was
any
mail
here
he
met
a
from
the
yellow
jacket
pass
region
sam
called
jim
sattler
heartily

brewster
catching
hold
of
hardened
hand
and
shaking
it
back
and
forth
air

sore
eyes

asked
brewster
scratching
his
neck
thoughtfully
the
same
wall
he
died
an
left
sary
with
nothing
but
funeral
costs
she
had
to
sell
that
measly
ranch
that

a
quarter
interest
in
to
pay
bills
and
now
she
hai
got
nawthin
but
her
health
better
see
sary
sam
it
was
the
dawn
of
hope
for
brewster
since
starting
on
his
search
he
had
been
growing
more
and
more
despondent
of
success
now
he
urged
his
horse
towards
yellow
jacket
pass
to
find
sary
dodd
after
seeking
at
various
ranches
for
the
elusive
sary
he
located
her
but
she
was
not
elusive
looking
she
was
six
feet
in
height
and
would
tip
the
scales
easily
at
two
hundred
pounds
are
you
widow
dodd
jim
sattler
sent
me
to
see
if
would
like
a
place
to
live
out

sam
brewster

beamed
and
exchanged
polite
introductions

immijit
the
rancher
saw
that
sary
was
to
accept
his
offer
of
a
place
but
he
was
not
the
man
to
take
advantage
of
her
in
financial
matters
so
he
replied
ah
we
ought
to
fix
the
wage
but
brewster
wants
some
one
at
once
and
can
settle
salary
when

there
ah

tell
what
a

sary
anxiously
all

but

time
packing

sary
laughed
brewster
facetiously
as
the
load
of
trouble
rolled
from
his
heart
sary
was
soon
perched
beside
the
rancher
on
the
high
spring
seat
of
the
lumbering
tenderly
holding
a
rubber
plant
on
that
drive
her
host
heard
more
of
every
family
history
of
the
ranchers
for
miles
around

he
had
ever
dreamed
of
knowing
even
if
he
lived

at

the
day
before
the
visitors

as

not

brewster
pulling

said
brewster
seeing
a
frown
coming
over
her
lord
and
master
face
as
he
wondered
if
his
was
to
be
shadowed
by
a
sorrowing
widow
the
moment
brewster
left
for
the
barn
his
wife
returned
to
the
help
who
had
plumped
herself
down
into
the
wooden
boston
rocker
and
was
fanning
herself
vigorously
with
a
newspaper

the

refrained
from
giving
her

but
she
busied
herself
with
unpinning
the
rusty
black
plush
cape
that
the
widow
had
donned
when
she
began
her
journey
to
new
surroundings
being
quite
rested
by
this
time
sary
gripped
a
hold
on
each
arm
of
the
rocker
and
managed
to
hoist
her
bulky
form
out
from
the
too
close
embrace
of
the
senseless
wooden
arms

into
john
chamber
now
to
be
a
guest
room
chapter
iv
the
servant
problem
solved
in
the
wild
mountain
regions
of
the
rockies
where
maids
are
unheard
of
and
the
hotels
provide
the
most
primitive
service
the
have
little
concern
over
the
perplexing
question
of
help
as
experienced
in
large
cities
if
it
is
necessary
to
assist
a
neighbor
who
is
marrying
off
a
daughter
and
wants
to
provide
her
with
a
trousseau
a
is
arranged
and
ranchers
families
for
miles
around
drive
in
and
visit
quilts
sheets
and
other
necessities
are
quickly
stitched
and
neatly
folded
out
of
the
way
by
the
women
while
the
men
occupy
themselves
with
work
about
the
place
until
it
is
time
for
the
grand
dinner
the
same
neighborly
help
is
offered
in
other
emergencies
so
that
few
families
want
servants
at
the
same
time
help
has
not
been
looked
down
upon
as
menial
work
by
the
ranchers
and
so
the
help
lives
as
a
member
of
the
family
that
happens
to
secure
one
in
cases
such
as
sary
dodd
where
a
woman
is
left
penniless
and
another
woman
needs
her
practical
aid
the
two
meet
and
the
kitchen
atmosphere
is
serene
quite
different
is
the
case
in
cities
however
sary
felt
she
was
the
social
equal
to
any
rancher
wife
for
had
she
not
been
mistress
of
a
ranch
too
even
though
it
was
never
paid
for
so
she
felt
she
was
doing
the
brewsters
a
favor
by
sharing
their
home
and
work
even
while
she
admitted
the
obligation
she
was
under
of
being
provided
with
bed
and
board
the
tiny
room
allotted
to
the
widow
was
directly
back
of
the
kitchen
it
had
a
single
window
that
gave
a
fine
view
of
rainbow
cliffs
but
the
furniture
was
of
the
plainest
sary
took
in
the
simplicity
in
one
glance
and
then
turned
to
her
mistress
ah
tell
how
sam
brewster
kin
buy
er
sell
th
hull
township
ef
he
likes
miss
brewster
ventured
sary
slyly
but
the
mistress
had
heard
of
sary
proneness
to
gossip
and
so
replied
we
do
consider
wealth
worth
anything
unless
you
know
what
to
do
with
it
we
live
as
comfortably
as
we
like
and
try
to
use
what
is
left
in
helping
others
sary
made
no
reply
to
this
statement
but
watched
brewster
go
to
the
window
and
pull
on
the
cord
that
was
stretched
at
one
side
of
the
instantly
the
decorated
pulleyed
up
to
allow
more
light
to
shine
into
the
room
now
ah
see
how
that
cried
sary
delightedly
brewster
turned
with
a
questioning
look
in
her
eyes
sary
explained
cal
lorrimer
tol
me
them
winder
shades
but
ah
jest
coulden
see
it
brewster
laughed
and
sary
ventured
to
pulley
the
shade
herself
she
drew
it
up
and
down
several
times
and
then
turned
to
express
her
sentiments
to
her
mistress
my
but
yuh
ferchunit
t
have
all
seeh
idees
in
the
house
it
clean
locoes
me
t
think
ah
livin
wid
sech
fine
contraptions
and
sary
pressed
her
large
freckled
hands
over
her
sparse
red
hair
to
signify
how
locoed
her
brain
really
was
brewster
laughed
merrily
why
sary
since
i
left
denver
my
friends
all
have
shades
in
the
windows
that
run
up
and
down
on
springs
without
any
other
help
they
go
by
themselves
now
miss
brewster
do
believe
that
quizzed
sary
looking
keenly
at
her
mistress
to
see
if
she
was
trying
to
laugh
at
her
ignorance
of
it
is
a
fact
sary
not
a
my
friend
has
them
all
through
her
house
and
i
expect
to
replace
these
pulleys
with
spring
rollers
some
day
sary
passed
her
hand
over
the
lustra
design
on
the
shade
and
brewster
turned
to
leave
the
room
before
she
closed
the
door
she
said
i
going
to
start
dinner
sary
when
you
are
ready
you
can
join
me
in
the
kitchen
the
moment
the
mistress
was
gone
sary
ran
to
make
sure
the
door
was
securely
closed
then
she
turned
to
inspect
the
belongings
of
the
room
huh
the
press
ai
so
much
plain
deal
painted
brown
the
press
was
passed
by
the
scornful
occupant
of
the
room
and
the
bed
next
came
under
her
appraising
eye
th
bed
soft
wood
too
but
it
feels
comfertible
sary
sat
on
the
bed
and
bounced
up
and
down
to
test
the
springs
and
mattress
before
she
pulled
back
the
covers
to
examine
the
quality
of
filling
in
the
ticking
laws
it
hai
it
soft
as
down
inborn
curiosity
compelled
her
to
take
a
hairpin
and
rip
open
a
bit
of
the
seam
to
her
amazement
she
pulled
out
a
tangle
of
long
whitish
hair
of
all
things
and
is
what
i
hev
to
sleep
on
ejaculated
the
insulted
maid
wall
we
see
about
that
the
sheets
and
newly
patched
quilt
were
designated
as
ornery
but
the
printed
spread
patterned
to
imitate
blue
torchon
lace
drew
a
murmur
of
admiration
from
the
woman
sary
quickly
changed
her
robe
of
mourning
to
a
calico
and
went
out
determined
to
speak
her
mind
about
that
awful
mattress
she
never
thought
such
a
rich
man
house
would
have
so
common
a
thing
as
combin
even
if
it
was
in
the
help
tick
but
the
wonderful
odor
of
boiling
cabbage
made
her
forget
her
complaint
for
the
time
being
she
went
to
the
stove
and
lifted
a
lid
from
the
large
kettle
she
sniffed
audibly
um
ah
loves
cabbige
soup
miss
brewster
do
you
sary
so
does
brewster
if
you
will
watch
the
meat
frying
i
will
blow
the
horn
to
call
the
men
to
dinner
brewster
waited
until
sary
began
thickening
the
gravy
then
she
took
the
horn
and
stood
upon
the
blowing
it
several
times
it
was
then
hung
back
of
the
kitchen
door
again
polly
come
now
dear
and
wash
up
for
dinner
called
brewster
standing
in
the
doorway
that
led
to
the
family
presently
the
family
augmented
by
sary
sat
down
in
the
kitchen
for
dinner
jeb
the
hired
man
had
followed
in
after
his
master
and
had
been
introduced
to
the
new
help
he
now
watched
her
capable
hands
and
arms
as
she
swung
the
from
the
stove
just
a
moment
sary
whispered
brewster
warningly
sary
looked
around
in
surprise
and
saw
the
others
with
bowed
heads
waiting
for
her
to
get
rid
of
the
pot
and
fold
her
hands
it
took
her
but
half
a
second
to
understand
and
follow
the
leading
the
ranchers
of
the
rocky
mountains
and
plains
are
most
orthodox
church
folk
they
would
as
soon
steal
or
murder
as
to
miss
meetin
or
work
on
a
sunday
and
most
of
them
have
regular
family
prayers
and
long
services
at
home
whenever
opportunity
offers
sam
brewster
was
not
one
of
the
latter
kind
but
the
longer
the
grace
he
said
the
better
a
man
he
thought
he
was
in
every
other
way
so
liberal
and
kind
it
was
not
consistent
for
him
to
act
so
regarding
religion
once
the
grace
was
said
the
host
unfolded
his
napkin
and
looked
to
sary
for
the
soup
the
had
been
taken
up
the
second
time
and
was
about
to
be
placed
in
the
middle
of
the
table
where
every
one
could
serve
themselves
as
they
wished
but
brewster
gave
her
a
look
and
sign
that
was
incomprehensible
she
was
confused
for
once
in
her
life
i
serve
the
soup
this
noon
sary
and
you
can
pass
the
plates
remarked
brewster
seeing
her
maid
did
not
understand
and
now
sary
beheld
a
new
order
of
things
soup
that
was
dipped
into
plates
and
passed
until
each
member
at
table
had
a
dish
before
him
large
white
napkins
that
were
not
tied
about
the
neck
but
spread
over
the
lap
how
funny
it
seemed
that
the
small
squares
sary
had
been
accustomed
to
when
company
came
were
nowhere
in
evidence
as
the
meal
progressed
sary
wonderment
increased
she
failed
to
hear
familiar
sounds
of
eating
nor
saw
the
usual
form
of
plying
knife
and
fork
together
immediately
after
dinner
polly
led
her
mother
to
john
room
maw
i
going
to
use
those
new
shades
i
bought
for
your
christmas
gift
and
put
them
at
the
windows
of
the
girls
room
oh
polly
do
you
think
plain
white
ones
will
look
nicer
quickly
replied
brewster
as
she
beheld
the
holland
decorated
with
monster
bronze
roses
and
huge
butterflies
polly
felt
disconcerted
for
the
moment
as
she
realized
that
her
mother
tone
implied
disapproval
of
the
change
but
she
would
not
admit
that
possibly
the
white
would
improve
the
why
maw
you
know
how
much
i
paid
for
those
shades
last
christmas
the
man
in
oak
creek
said
they
were
the
grandest
ones
in
denver
maybe
thought
so
polly
but
we
must
remember
that
his
taste
in
art
has
lacked
cultivation
now
i
prefer
pure
white
shades
or
curtains
for
a
window
said
wise
brewster
leaving
her
daughter
to
wonder
whether
she
liked
pure
white
for
the
also
but
polly
had
enough
human
will
and
stubbornness
in
her
to
resist
the
suggestion
offered
by
her
experienced
mother
well
tell
you
what
we
do
maw
i
just
put
these
lovely
shades
up
till
after
the
girls
see
them
then
we
change
to
white
i
think
it
will
be
best
to
keep
these
new
and
clean
for
the
front
room
but
i
want
the
city
girls
to
we
got
such
expensive
things
in
the
house
polly
dear
that
is
foolish
i
have
always
tried
to
teach
you
otherwise
what
matters
it
whether
you
display
gorgeous
if
the
thing
be
false
simplicity
and
wisdom
are
the
rarest
adornments
of
a
home
there
you
go
again
maw
lecturing
me
with
your
wise
old
saws
laughed
polly
jumping
upon
the
chair
to
fit
the
shades
in
place
brewster
smiled
but
said
nothing
she
knew
how
soon
her
child
would
learn
good
from
bad
once
she
came
in
contact
with
strangers
and
so
well
had
the
mother
grounded
her
daughter
that
she
had
no
qualms
about
the
result
of
any
contacts
brewster
watched
while
polly
finished
the
placing
of
the
dreadful
shades
then
she
looked
about
at
the
colored
prints
tacked
upon
every
available
spot
of
rough
her
brow
puckered
at
the
conglomeration
of
subjects
and
sizes
of
the
chromos
but
she
knew
how
carefully
polly
had
saved
every
one
of
them
that
had
arrived
with
tea
or
soap
so
she
passed
no
audible
judgment
oh
maw
i
have
another
great
idea
cried
polly
jumping
from
the
chair
and
clapping
her
hands
yes
let
move
daddy
sofa
into
the
bedroom
and
place
it
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
just
like
the
pictures
in
the
show
us
then
we
wo
have
to
have
the
single
bed
brought
in
from
the
barn
anne
can
sleep
on
the
i
really
think
anne
stewart
will
prefer
a
bed
polly
even
if
it
is
small
gasped
brewster
hastily
then
we
change
later
it
wo
take
a
minute
to
move
the
sofa
in
and
it
will
look
so
citified
to
the
girls
who
most
likely
have
divans
or
sofas
in
their
bedrooms
at
home
i
think
they
will
like
the
difference
not
having
their
country
bedroom
look
like
the
city
one
a
complete
change
always
is
better
than
a
similar
environment
especially
if
the
city
rooms
are
more
artistically
furnished
than
the
result
of
efforts
now
maw
do
you
want
me
to
surprise
them
with
the
sofa
john
gave
paw
and
you
long
ago
i
sure
they
wo
hurt
it
coaxed
polly
oh
i
not
thinking
of
any
damage
i
was
wondering
how
anne
would
like
to
sleep
on
a
folding
sofa
instead
of
in
a
bed
she
wo
mind
and
she
be
glad
to
see
her
friends
impressed
by
the
bedroom
furniture
quickly
explained
polly
well
then
call
sary
to
help
you
shove
it
in
while
i
go
and
find
those
braided
mats
we
made
last
winter
said
brewster
in
a
tone
of
resignation
polly
needed
no
second
consent
but
ran
out
to
call
sary
the
sofa
was
soon
wheeled
from
the
into
the
bedroom
which
adjoined
the
at
the
back
once
it
was
placed
at
the
foot
of
the
heavy
walnut
bed
polly
whipped
off
the
cretonne
covering
that
always
hid
the
hideous
upholstery
as
the
came
off
and
revealed
the
red
and
green
and
purple
design
polly
glanced
at
sary
to
see
the
effect
made
oh
laws
ah
never
see
sech
a
sofy
ai
it
grand
breathed
sary
lost
in
admiration
sary
it
opens
too
announced
polly
condescendingly
pulling
at
the
strap
that
moved
the
spring
to
turn
the
half
into
a
low
bed
well
suhs
what
next
yoh
paw
must
be
a
milyonaire
shore
no
sary
john
saved
his
money
for
selling
chickens
and
a
calf
and
got
this
for
paw
and
maw
when
he
went
to
high
school
in
denver
oh
we
had
an
awful
time
carting
it
from
oak
creek
to
pebbly
pit
through
all
the
snow
and
weather
explained
polly
brewster
laughed
at
the
remembrance
but
told
polly
that
she
hoped
she
would
keep
the
cover
on
the
sofa
you
do
mean
me
to
cover
up
the
velvet
do
you
asked
polly
aghast
at
the
suggestion
perhaps
anne
will
sleep
better
if
the
flowers
are
out
of
sight
remarked
brewster
softly
but
with
amused
sarcasm
mought
better
do
that
miss
pollee
cuz
them
colors
will
git
in
this
bright
light
added
sary
i
am
not
worrying
about
the
fade
sary
but
over
the
fact
that
the
young
teacher
and
her
friends
will
think
we
such
crude
articles
of
furniture
instead
of
tolerating
them
just
because
my
dear
children
denied
themselves
to
give
us
pleasure
it
is
their
motive
and
delight
that
we
all
felt
in
the
gifts
more
than
the
objects
which
showed
immature
judgment
explained
brewster
slowly
and
thoughtfully
polly
was
silenced
and
she
suddenly
realized
how
far
she
must
climb
before
she
knew
as
much
as
her
mother
even
though
she
studied
art
notes
in
the
monthly
magazines
that
reached
the
ranch
i
wonder
if
the
harsh
color
maw
speaks
of
is
the
real
cause
of
that
cretonne
cover
always
being
over
the
sofa
wondered
the
girl
to
herself
but
she
said
nothing
and
the
sofa
was
left
at
the
foot
of
the
great
bed
brewster
knew
she
had
said
much
so
she
left
the
room
and
beckoned
sary
to
follow
her
to
the
kitchen
polly
silently
proceeded
with
the
finishing
touches
to
the
room
she
hung
a
mirror
over
the
the
glass
was
greenish
in
hue
and
wavy
in
lines
but
it
looked
like
a
reflector
and
so
it
remained
in
position
an
enameled
basin
and
earthen
jug
did
duty
for
toilet
purposes
the
plain
deal
chairs
were
decorated
with
crocheted
tidies
one
tied
to
the
back
of
each
chair
and
last
but
not
least
came
the
treasure
of
the
brewster
family
it
had
been
preserved
in
paper
wrappings
and
lavender
for
many
years
and
now
and
then
the
mistress
of
the
removed
it
and
hung
it
out
to
keep
the
folds
from
turning
yellow
there
now
when
they
see
this
knitted
cotton
spread
with
its
raised
roses
and
lilies
those
girls
will
know
that
we
can
have
wonderful
things
here
as
well
as
there
so
saying
polly
spread
out
the
thick
white
quilt
until
the
large
was
smoothly
covered
then
she
stood
back
and
sighed
with
gratification
at
the
result
of
her
afternoon
work
there
now
i
just
call
maw
before
i
close
up
the
room
murmured
polly
skipping
away
to
look
for
brewster
sary
followed
closely
after
the
mistress
as
polly
led
the
triumphal
march
to
the
the
door
was
flung
open
and
the
ladies
asked
to
admire
polly
something
told
me
that
you
would
get
the
spread
out
of
the
chest
declared
brewster
patting
her
daughter
gently
and
your
would
be
so
pleased
if
she
were
here
to
see
how
you
honored
her
work
some
day
these
quaint
spreads
and
quilts
will
become
quite
the
rage
again
and
then
you
will
feel
proud
to
show
yours
i
think
anne
will
appreciate
the
endless
task
such
a
spread
represents
and
once
more
polly
felt
that
she
had
not
expressed
her
interior
decorating
ideals
on
the
same
high
plane
her
mother
seemed
to
have
reached
but
she
would
not
admit
having
made
a
mistake
so
the
crocheted
spread
remained
even
as
the
green
shades
and
the
gay
sofa
remained
to
welcome
the
city
girls
to
pebbly
pit
chapter
v
unpleasant
surprises
the
time
set
for
the
meeting
of
the
maynard
girls
and
anne
stewart
at
the
denver
terminal
station
came
and
passed
with
no
sign
of
the
chicago
travelers
then
stewart
was
seen
hurrying
down
the
platform
waving
a
yellow
envelope
to
attract
her
daughter
attention
anne
was
patiently
seated
on
the
edge
of
a
truck
looking
keenly
at
every
one
in
sight
so
she
soon
saw
her
mother
the
oak
creek
local
that
left
denver
daily
at
noon
was
getting
up
enough
steam
to
enable
it
to
make
a
start
whether
it
would
arrive
was
a
question
anne
hastily
tore
the
telegram
open
and
read
it
aloud
missed
train
do
wait
for
us
go
on
and
send
machine
to
meet
us
same
train
at
oak
creek
explain
to
brewsters
bob
anne
looked
at
her
mother
and
laughed
if
that
is
bob
all
over
guess
her
hair
was
dressed
do
they
think
the
brewsters
run
a
limousine
or
do
they
mean
a
asked
stewart
guilelessly
anne
laughed
again
at
her
mother
innocent
expression
but
stewart
added
i
told
you
no
good
would
come
of
transplanting
flowers
to
an
roundel
i
can
picture
bob
maynard
hiking
from
oak
creek
station
to
pebbly
pit
most
likely
she
will
wear
french
heeled
shoes
said
anne
and
she
laughed
so
merrily
that
waiting
passengers
in
the
dingy
cars
glanced
from
the
tiny
windows
and
felt
better
for
the
contagious
laughter
oh
my
dear
you
wo
think
of
making
those
city
girls
start
training
with
such
a
hard
lesson
will
you
cried
stewart
who
understood
the
reason
maynard
had
for
this
outing
bless
your
dear
heart
no
i
send
the
wagon
for
them
but
i
wondered
what
would
happen
in
case
they
to
walk
well
i
thankful
i
not
in
maynard
shoes
when
those
girls
find
out
what
they
will
have
to
do
all
summer
nolla
will
be
in
her
glory
began
anne
when
the
conductor
hurried
over
to
the
two
women
going
by
this
train
ladies
mother
i
write
all
about
the
reception
laughed
anne
hurriedly
kissing
her
mother
and
giving
her
a
hug
all
aboard
shouted
the
brakeman
as
the
tardy
passenger
mounted
the
steep
steps
and
waved
her
hand
at
stewart
it
was
a
ride
of
about
seventy
miles
and
anne
thoroughly
enjoyed
reviewing
every
landmark
as
she
passed
it
by
jeb
stood
waiting
at
the
little
station
of
oak
creek
his
mouth
and
eyes
wide
open
as
he
watched
the
train
pull
in
always
an
exciting
time
for
the
farmhand
the
cumbersome
with
its
high
was
drawn
up
beside
a
telegraph
pole
to
which
the
skittish
young
horses
had
been
securely
tied
anne
went
over
to
meet
jeb
and
said
with
a
smile
were
you
waiting
for
some
ladies
for
the
brewsters
i
am
anne
stewart
the
teacher
who
used
to
be
at
bear
forks
school

missed
their
train
and
expect
to
be
here
on
what
is
your
name
may
i
ask
jeb
laconically
replied
the
man
looking
about
as
if
he
still
missed
a
necessary
item
for
the
return
trip
oh
i
guess
you
want
my
baggage
it
that
small
trunk
over
by
the
explained
anne
and
jeb
grinned
with
relief
as
he
carried
the
trunk
lightly
as
if
it
were
a
stick
anne
remarked
it
too
bad
to
make
you
take
this
trip
again
not
kin
notice
it
is
fer
the
miners
en
oak
crick
is
a
lively
town
them
times
explained
jeb
winking
an
eye
to
show
what
fun
he
expected
to
have
next
day
then
it
a
lucky
thing
for
you
jeb
that
my
friends
missed
the
train
jes
so
chuckled
jeb
as
he
gathered
up
the
reins
and
snacked
the
whip
over
his
horses
heads
conversation
lagged
after
the
start
for
the
bumping
and
rumbling
of
the
heavy
wagon
as
it
went
over
rocks
and
ruts
in
the
rough
trail
forced
all
the
breath
from
the
passenger
lungs
the
wagon
drew
up
beside
the
porch
of
the
and
anne
found
the
family
waiting
to
receive
them
she
jumped
from
her
perch
and
greeted
polly
then
smiled
at
and
brewster
as
the
girl
introduced
her
even
sary
felt
flattered
at
the
kindly
greeting
accorded
her
by
this
pretty
you
are
all
alone
gasped
polly
then
anne
explained
about
the
telegram
just
as
her
train
was
about
to
leave
denver
the
looks
of
blank
surprise
changed
to
relief
as
the
family
heard
the
cause
of
the
other
two
girls
they
all
entered
the
house
together
delighted
with
each
other
brewster
felt
that
she
was
going
to
like
this
girl
anne
was
delighted
with
the
place
and
everything
in
connection
with
it
even
the
intense
coloring
of
the
sofa
or
the
shades
failed
to
disturb
her
peace
and
repose
that
night
after
the
supper
dishes
had
been
cleared
away
brewster
led
the
way
to
the
wide
terrace
that
stretched
from
the
porch
to
the
descent
of
the
crater
here
the
group
watched
the
sunset
and
became
better
acquainted
by
bedtime
brewster
was
of
the
opinion
that
any
man
excepting
john
who
got
anne
stewart
for
a
wife
was
very
fortunate
indeed
john
was
still
a
superior
being
the
next
morning
at
breakfast
brewster
said
to
jeb
ah
have
to
look
after
some
business
in
oak
creek
jeb
so
you
need
not
drive
over
for
the
girls
ah
will
stop
at
the
station
and
look
them
up
mebbe
better
take
me
to
hist
the
trunks
es
ah
am
young
and
hearty
ventured
jeb
anxiously
you
why
jeb
ah
can
turn
you
over
with
my
small
finger
laughed
brewster
comparing
his
tall
muscular
frame
with
that
of
small
slim
jeb
so
jeb
slouched
away
to
look
after
his
master
farm
work
as
well
as
his
own
and
as
he
worked
he
grumbled
and
thought
of
the
fun
and
frolics
the
fellers
in
oak
creek
were
having
on
their
at
the
denver
station
two
girls
dressed
in
the
latest
modes
walked
along
the
platform
toward
a
line
of
railway
coaches
what
cars
can
these
be
right
said
barbara
maynard
and
the
younger
girl
eleanor
replied
i
suppose
they
burn
soft
coal
well
they
should
everything
we
have
on
will
be
covered
with
soot
before
we
reach
the
town
that
will
mean
more
business
for
the
at
oak
creek
laughed
eleanor
had
she
known
that
the
place
could
not
boast
of
any
kind
of
a
cleaning
establishment
she
would
have
laughed
louder
and
longer
at
the
novelty
i
suppose
this
oak
creek
is
the
shopping
center
for
all
the
smaller
villages
that
are
within
motoring
distance
of
it
surmised
barbara
i
suppose
so
agreed
eleanor
as
she
watched
a
man
oil
the
wheels
under
the
engine
the
man
finished
the
work
and
straightened
up
his
face
and
hands
were
black
from
grease
and
oil
and
soot
but
he
smiled
a
friendly
smile
at
the
young
ladies
who
were
obviously
waiting
to
board
his
train
she
all
made
up
leddies
ef
wants
to
git
in
mercy
does
he
have
to
grin
as
if
he
were
an
old
friend
when
he
announces
the
fact
complained
barbara
daintily
picking
her
way
between
boxes
and
bags
of
freight
he
a
genuine
western
type
laughed
eleanor
following
her
sister
into
the
coach
goodness
gracious
are
we
expected
to
sit
on
these
old
dusty
plush
seats
cried
barbara
whipping
the
upholstery
with
her
tiny
handkerchief
before
she
seated
herself
again
eleanor
laughed
but
she
was
not
as
merry
as
when
she
jumped
from
the
pullman
that
morning
quite
different
were
the
sensations
of
the
two
city
girls
to
those
of
anne
stewart
as
they
passed
over
the
same
route
and
saw
the
same
country
perhaps
it
was
the
difference
in
training
more
than
the
ideals
of
the
three
girls
nolla
can
all
the
houses
be
as
horrid
as
those
we
have
passed
by
asked
barbara
nodding
at
a
group
of
i
do
know
but
they
certainly
are
smaller
than
the
homes
in
chicago
are
they
rejoined
eleanor
gazing
in
open
curiosity
at
the
scenery
and
buildings
so
different
from
that
of
the
city
smaller
why
they
are
simply
in
looks
exclaimed
barbara
in
disgust
the
nearer
the
train
came
to
oak
creek
the
smaller
and
rougher
the
houses
seemed
until
the
guard
called
out
oak
crick
here
your
station
the
girls
gazed
at
each
other
in
consternation
for
the
place
was
little
more
than
a
rough
mining
settlement
or
the
brakeman
caught
up
the
leather
bags
and
jumped
from
the
slowing
train
he
planked
them
down
regardless
of
contents
and
ran
off
to
the
station
it
was
an
old
discarded
shoved
on
a
siding
to
do
duty
as
and
freight
station
the
girls
hurried
out
to
the
car
platform
and
barbara
asked
nolla
why
do
you
call
the
porter
they
never
had
one
on
this
line
then
stepping
down
from
the
high
narrow
steps
of
the
train
eleanor
cried
gracious
do
catch
me
if
i
fall
barbara
stared
about
as
a
frozen
horror
slowly
crept
into
her
soul
and
was
expressed
in
her
eyes
was
the
lovely
mountain
resort
for
which
she
had
planned
such
conquests
eleanor
spied
the
precious
bags
too
close
to
the
tracks
to
insure
their
safety
so
she
rushed
over
to
save
them
from
disaster
for
who
could
tell
whether
that
shaky
old
train
would
hold
together
much
longer
but
the
local
looked
worse
than
it
really
was
it
was
as
reliable
a
set
of
old
cars
as
could
be
found
even
if
the
paint
and
polish
had
vanished
with
age
just
as
the
bags
were
recovered
the
whistle
tooted
the
wheels
grated
in
turning
and
the
train
that
on
its
return
trip
to
denver
might
have
carried
these
girls
back
to
kind
of
civilization
slowly
pulled
out
of
sight
eleanor
struggled
with
the
two
bags
of
toilet
accessories
and
deposited
them
before
her
sister
bet
you
everything
is
broken
and
our
ruined
with
perfume
as
barbara
made
no
reply
eleanor
followed
the
direction
of
her
stare
a
group
of
dreadful
looking
miners
and
a
crowd
of
were
using
seven
expensive
wardrobe
trunks
for
their
pleasure
evidently
the
men
had
indulged
in
too
many
tests
of
oak
creek
whiskey
called
pizen
by
the
natives
the
were
picturesque
enough
in
their
wide
sombreros
woolly
chaps
gay
shirts
and
a
swagger
that
matched
their
trick
of
shooting
the
miners
were
swarthy
bearded
foreigners
who
wore
long
boots
loose
shirts
and
belts
from
which
protruded
as
eleanor
decided
to
go
over
to
the
circle
surrounding
the
trunks
and
demand
an
explanation
she
heard
a
hardened
miner
shout
it
my
deal
next
then
the
sisters
saw
that
their
largest
trunk
had
been
turned
over
on
its
side
to
make
a
convenient
the
others
accommodated
the
players
and
loungers
whose
spurred
heels
beat
a
tattoo
upon
the
polished
covers
humph
at
least
we
can
display
original
etchings
on
our
trunks
when
we
get
them
back
home
remarked
eleanor
with
a
gleam
of
amusement
at
the
affair
everything
will
simply
be
ruined
just
see
that
trunk
holding
my
right
by
that
do
make
those
awful
creatures
go
away
wo
you
nolla
begged
barbara
with
those
nasty
guns
sticking
from
their
belts
not
me
but
i
go
to
the
office
and
complain
to
the
so
eleanor
courageously
turned
her
back
on
the
fascinating
sight
of
all
those
revolvers
and
barbara
followed
closely
at
her
sister
heels
both
of
them
hurried
to
the
old
car
that
displayed
a
sign
saying
it
was
the
no
one
was
there
so
the
girls
stood
at
the
door
whence
the
road
leading
to
the
railway
could
be
seen
if
only
we
knew
when
the
chauffeur
would
come
sighed
barbara
but
now
eleanor
had
misgivings
about
an
automobile
meantime
the
men
had
seen
the
two
strangers
hovering
about
but
they
were
not
aware
that
the
trunks
belonged
to
the
when
the
girls
entered
the
station
one
old
rascal
leaned
over
and
said
them
are
tenderfeet
an
oughter
welcome
in
th
good
custom
sure
thing
cried
the
others
and
they
quickly
planned
eleanor
decided
it
was
time
to
dispossess
these
ruffians
from
her
property
so
she
assumed
an
air
of
courage
and
started
for
the
group
while
barbara
held
firmly
to
her
sister
sleeve
but
an
unexpected
denouement
halted
the
two
girls
ah
say
you
cheated
that
deal
howled
a
miner
at
the
same
time
he
slapped
his
leather
gauntlet
across
a
face
instantly
every
revolver
was
whipped
forth
and
a
terrible
fight
ensued
every
man
taking
part
in
the
general
melee
the
girls
trembling
with
fear
as
shots
and
curses
rang
out
profusely
clung
to
each
other
helplessly
but
failed
to
note
that
the
guns
were
aimed
skyward
hey
boys
what
the
deuce
do
mean
shouted
a
man
coming
upon
the
scene
unannounced
the
crowd
of
men
looked
sheepish
and
hurriedly
explained
the
joke
looking
over
in
the
direction
of
the
two
strangers
as
their
welcome
was
considered
a
huge
joke
the
men
laughed
loudly
brewster
for
it
was
the
rancher
frowned
when
he
saw
the
pale
girls
almost
fainting
from
fear
then
he
turned
to
the
ringleader
in
the
plot
say
bill
was
that
pesky
train
from
denver
on
time
or
too
soon
for
a
change
asked
brewster
consulting
his
watch
it
war
ten
minits
too
airly
hank
janssen
th
ingineer
got
a
christenin
down
to
his
home
explained
bill
then
those
two
girls
are
my
company
groaned
the
rancher
causing
a
scramble
at
his
words
the
whipped
off
their
hats
to
salute
and
the
miners
shuffled
behind
the
daring
the
better
to
hide
their
faces
from
the
boss
brewster
hurried
over
to
reassure
the
girls
that
the
whole
fight
had
been
staged
to
entertain
them
he
explained
the
cause
of
his
not
being
on
hand
to
meet
them
and
waving
his
hand
for
the
he
called
get
busy
boys
shake
those
trunks
into
the
wagon
while
the
men
eagerly
lent
shoulders
and
muscles
to
the
task
expected
of
them
the
three
principals
in
this
group
made
personal
notes
of
each
other
albeit
not
a
word
was
said
ah
never
did
see
such
ridiculous
styles
as
this
thought
sam
brewster
looking
the
girls
over
from
top
to
toe
this
rough
man
brewster
why
he
a
common
farmer
thought
barbara
disdainfully
i
bet
polly
father
a
heap
of
fun
thought
eleanor
when
brewster
realized
there
were
great
trunks
belonging
to
two
girls
he
groaned
within
himself
wondering
what
in
the
world
could
be
found
to
fill
so
many
the
men
were
handed
cigars
and
as
they
doffed
their
hats
to
say
thank
they
backed
away
to
permit
the
boss
to
help
the
girls
up
the
high
barbara
looked
at
the
rough
stained
hands
and
said
insultingly
no
thank
you
here
let
me
jump
up
and
pull
you
in
laughed
eleanor
uncomfortably
seeing
that
her
sister
had
offended
their
host
sam
brewster
turned
to
give
his
horses
a
pail
of
water
while
the
two
girls
attempted
to
climb
up
but
the
small
steel
was
too
high
to
be
reached
without
a
boost
from
below
so
they
had
to
climb
hand
over
hand
up
the
great
wheel
with
its
spokes
clogged
with
the
heavy
mud
from
the
trails
when
they
were
finally
seated
both
girls
looked
at
each
other
fresh
natty
traveling
suits
were
streaked
by
the
mud
and
their
gloves
soft
could
now
be
thrown
away
even
their
faces
had
been
smeared
with
mud
when
they
slipped
and
had
to
clutch
at
any
possible
rescue
naturally
they
were
not
in
too
amiable
a
frame
of
mind
for
what
awaited
them
at
the
end
of
the
trip
the
high
was
the
only
one
so
barbara
had
to
sit
there
i
simply
can
not
hold
on
to
this
complained
she
testily
it
the
only
one
bob
so
you
will
to
replied
eleanor
in
another
moment
brewster
climbed
up
easily
and
sat
beside
the
strangers
he
churked
to
the
horses
and
drove
away
in
a
manner
that
threatened
to
hurl
the
city
girls
from
their
earthly
perch
into
kingdom
come
oh
this
is
terrible
groaned
barbara
at
an
unusually
hard
bump
of
the
wagon
over
a
rutty
road
maybe
we
can
sit
down
on
the
floor
of
the
wagon
where
the
trunks
are
ventured
eleanor
looking
at
brewster
shore
if
want
to
the
senseless
trunks
make
better
company
than
a
rough
old
farmer
replied
brewster
without
the
least
suspicion
of
malice
in
the
words
the
exchange
was
made
and
the
girls
felt
protected
by
the
trunks
so
they
could
take
a
livelier
interest
in
the
ride
as
they
left
the
road
leading
from
oak
creek
the
sight
of
imposing
mountains
towering
in
the
distance
thrilled
them
in
spite
of
their
determination
to
dislike
everything
they
saw
and
the
gorgeous
hues
and
beauty
of
the
strange
caused
exclamations
from
eleanor
while
barbara
gasped
at
the
vast
herds
of
cattle
grazing
as
they
roamed
over
the
plains
finally
brewster
guided
the
horses
away
from
the
wide
trail
into
the
bear
forks
trail
that
wound
in
and
out
now
on
the
brink
of
the
river
chasm
or
again
between
jagged
cliffs
anon
the
awed
girls
gazed
down
into
fearful
depths
as
the
wagon
skirted
the
dangerous
brink
or
craned
their
necks
to
look
at
the
wonderful
vines
and
foliage
hanging
from
the
tops
of
massive
rocks
by
the
time
they
reached
the
ridge
of
where
the
trail
led
off
to
the
cliffs
at
the
devil
grave
both
sisters
were
silenced
by
the
impressive
scenery
so
that
petty
problems
of
puny
mortals
faded
into
a
misty
suddenly
the
trail
turned
around
a
group
of
great
rocks
and
the
first
glimpse
of
rainbow
cliffs
could
be
seen
as
the
wagon
drew
nigh
the
gorge
running
through
the
cliffs
anne
stewart
and
polly
were
found
waiting
for
the
visitors
anne
introduced
polly
and
eleanor
acknowledged
the
courtesy
but
barbara
rudely
failed
to
notice
it
as
she
was
so
obsessed
with
the
desire
to
complain
about
the
railroad
the
natives
of
oak
creek
the
trails
to
pebbly
pit
and
everything
connected
with
the
coming
polly
felt
dreadfully
shy
with
such
girls
not
that
their
hats
had
feathers
or
fine
flowers
nor
their
suits
had
any
expensive
trimmings
on
them
to
suggest
wealth
but
the
way
they
in
their
clothes
what
made
the
difference
she
wondered
had
anne
told
her
the
actual
cost
of
those
hats
and
suits
poor
polly
would
have
fainted
from
shock
barbara
was
holding
forth
on
her
wrongs
i
ca
see
for
the
life
of
me
anne
why
you
selected
such
an
outlandish
spot
as
this
for
us
in
which
to
waste
a
precious
summer
why
it
is
simply
nothing
but
mountains
and
trails
in
sight
and
no
one
but
just
farmers
to
associate
with
oh
oh
the
accent
on
farmers
made
polly
wince
and
eleanor
frown
at
the
speaker
anne
hastened
to
change
the
subject
for
she
feared
brewster
might
turn
his
horses
and
take
them
all
back
to
oak
creek
station
it
was
a
duel
of
dialogue
between
anne
and
barbara
after
that
each
one
trying
to
keep
up
a
conversation
they
wished
to
down
the
other
with
thus
the
wagon
reached
the
porch
polly
sprang
out
and
ran
indoors
unnoticed
by
any
one
eleanor
was
deeply
interested
in
gazing
out
at
the
great
crater
bowl
that
formed
the
pasture
and
of
pebbly
pit
anne
was
anxious
to
have
her
charges
make
a
good
impression
on
brewster
and
so
she
jumped
out
and
held
a
hand
to
assist
barbara
the
lady
of
the
house
stood
waiting
to
welcome
the
girls
when
sary
ran
out
from
the
kitchen
hurriedly
drying
her
wet
hands
on
an
apron
she
fully
expected
to
shake
hands
with
the
fine
ladies
when
her
turn
came
to
be
introduced
she
stood
directly
back
of
her
mistress
peering
eagerly
at
the
in
their
simple
straw
hats
severe
cloth
suits
and
shoes
gloves
and
veils
of
the
finest
before
anne
stewart
could
open
her
lips
to
introduce
the
girls
barbara
sent
a
scornful
glance
over
the
group
and
then
at
the
and
said
what
a
barracks
it
nothing
more
than
a
log
cabin
on
a
gigantic
scale
oh
i
think
it
is
great
just
like
the
wonderful
cabins
we
read
about
in
the
adirondacks
or
other
large
quickly
added
eleanor
but
this
is
not
a
camp
my
poor
little
sister
and
we
have
the
same
set
either
as
we
would
have
had
at
a
fashionable
camp
sneered
barbara
you
need
me
bob
i
just
crazy
over
the
farm
and
and
everything
hurry
up
anne
and
introduce
me
so
i
can
get
acquainted
cried
eleanor
nudging
the
teacher
to
remind
her
of
her
duty
brewster
had
driven
the
team
to
a
post
a
little
farther
up
the
road
and
was
not
present
when
the
introductions
took
place
brewster
summoned
a
pleasant
smile
for
barbara
and
a
motherly
pat
on
the
shoulder
for
eleanor
then
sary
stepped
forward
to
be
introduced
as
it
was
customary
for
her
to
be
treated
as
a
member
of
the
family
glad
t
know
simpered
sary
bowing
stiffly
and
offering
her
reddened
hand
to
shake
the
gloved
ones
of
the
girls
barbara
completely
ignored
the
digits
and
slightly
lifted
one
eyebrow
at
sary
eleanor
felt
so
humiliated
at
her
sister
actions
that
she
came
forward
to
make
amends
but
sary
would
have
none
of
it
when
barbara
gave
her
a
frozen
look
sary
examined
her
hands
for
a
moment
then
humped
her
shoulders
and
stamped
back
to
the
where
she
had
been
boiling
and
straining
out
the
scum
before
the
arrival
of
the
city
misses
anne
would
your
friends
like
to
refresh
themselves
in
the
bedroom
asked
brewster
to
break
the
embarrassed
silence
oh
yes
of
course
replied
anne
anxiously
turning
to
barbara
eleanor
took
the
initiative
of
going
toward
the
door
i
never
saw
such
a
darling
bungalow
i
just
love
everything
spread
out
on
the
ground
floor
no
stairs
and
no
elevators
oh
how
nice
it
is
a
change
from
your
mansions
is
it
replied
brewster
smiling
at
the
concerned
face
to
me
it
is
the
most
awful
place
i
do
suppose
you
have
baths
or
electric
light
or
telephone
service
said
barbara
now
you
see
here
barbara
maynard
you
got
to
stop
this
whimpering
or
i
wire
daddy
to
make
you
go
home
i
just
wo
have
my
whole
summer
spoiled
by
your
complaints
cried
eleanor
angrily
and
stamping
her
foot
to
emphasize
her
words
i
hope
you
did
expect
me
to
here
did
you
demanded
barbara
i
hope
you
wo
that
all
i
got
to
say
come
on
anne
and
show
me
the
place
where
polly
gone
said
eleanor
polly
was
found
in
the
large
looking
the
picture
of
disappointment
anne
understood
how
she
must
have
felt
so
she
diverted
the
attention
of
the
newcomers
to
the
great
yawning
that
could
hold
several
at
one
time
and
do
you
know
nolla
every
bit
of
wood
in
this
house
was
hewn
and
carted
here
by
brewster
you
see
the
government
allows
settlers
just
so
much
timber
with
which
to
construct
a
home
and
barns
there
is
a
county
sawmill
to
saw
and
trim
logs
and
then
the
owner
has
to
cart
them
himself
naturally
one
has
time
to
carve
fancy
in
the
wood
one
uses
for
the
house
and
having
it
sent
from
denver
or
other
large
cities
where
labor
is
to
be
had
is
also
out
of
the
question
the
freight
costs
and
the
long
haul
from
oak
creek
to
the
pit
presents
difficulties
not
to
be
overcome
so
folks
build
homes
as
solid
and
strong
as
they
can
and
leave
the
trimmings
for
a
future
generation
anne
explained
all
this
for
barbara
benefit
and
brewster
smiled
her
gratitude
to
the
girl
eleanor
seemed
more
impressed
than
ever
after
she
heard
of
the
time
and
labor
it
must
have
taken
to
construct
such
a
house
as
the
brewster
ranch
boasted
and
barbara
was
taken
back
as
she
had
not
thought
of
such
things
but
she
pretended
not
to
care
illustration
with
caption
barbara
completely
ignored
sary
chapter
vi
the
harrowing
details
now
girls
come
and
see
the
polly
prepared
for
us
you
know
she
is
going
to
study
interior
decorating
when
she
grows
up
are
you
polly
said
anne
placing
an
arm
protectingly
about
the
girl
shoulders
and
moving
towards
the
chamber
polly
brightened
up
at
once
for
she
remembered
the
sofa
that
anne
had
praised
as
having
made
a
fine
bed
and
then
there
were
the
gorgeous
bronzed
shades
that
darkened
the
windows
polly
stood
at
the
head
of
the
sofa
watching
eagerly
for
the
effect
of
the
decorating
on
the
city
visitors
barbara
stared
at
first
in
utter
unbelief
that
her
room
could
be
so
barren
of
comfort
then
she
turned
and
frowned
darkly
as
the
truth
impressed
her
why
there
nothing
here
only
an
old
bed
and
a
painted
set
of
drawers
such
as
our
servants
would
fling
out
of
the
room
then
she
caught
a
twisted
reflection
of
her
face
in
the
green
mirror
it
was
too
much
she
threw
herself
upon
the
sofa
and
laughed
hysterically
eleanor
wondered
at
her
sister
discordant
mirth
but
when
she
looked
in
the
direction
barbara
eyes
were
turned
she
saw
the
cause
verily
anne
goeth
before
a
fall
poor
bob
said
eleanor
cynically
anne
could
not
hide
a
smile
at
the
words
but
tried
to
smooth
matters
out
by
going
to
the
window
and
speaking
of
the
view
i
had
landscape
enough
for
one
day
anne
and
could
recover
somewhat
if
i
had
an
opportunity
without
having
a
family
party
about
retorted
barbara
meaningly
instantly
brewster
turned
and
beckoned
polly
to
follow
her
from
the
room
the
moment
the
door
closed
upon
the
hostess
and
her
daughter
barbara
anticipated
her
friend
reproach
anne
where
were
your
brains
when
you
recommended
this
awful
place
to
father
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
recommending
it
bob
your
father
already
knew
of
it
and
merely
asked
me
to
write
polly
my
little
pupil
of
a
few
years
ago
but
why
did
you
tell
what
to
expect
demanded
the
angry
girl
simply
because
i
was
asked
not
to
mention
any
particulars
that
might
prejudice
you
and
besides
you
never
asked
me
anything
retorted
anne
feeling
impatient
with
barbara
what
more
bob
i
ca
see
any
justice
in
making
the
poor
brewsters
suffer
for
what
your
own
father
did
but
i
glad
he
sent
us
here
it
is
great
declared
eleanor
naturally
you
find
your
level
in
a
common
country
home
and
family
said
barbara
in
an
unpleasant
voice
words
never
killed
any
one
bob
so
keep
it
up
if
it
makes
you
feel
better
i
used
to
your
complaints
laughed
eleanor
and
allow
me
to
add
bob
that
the
brewsters
are
common
farmers
brewster
had
a
better
education
and
has
more
sense
than
any
woman
other
than
my
mother
that
i
know
and
brewster
is
a
fine
man
respected
by
every
one
that
knows
him
even
the
government
admires
his
intelligence
and
worth
and
employs
him
in
cases
where
they
need
expert
agricultural
advice
and
reports
anne
spoke
with
frankness
and
warmth
the
government
employs
all
sorts
of
men
in
its
need
but
that
say
the
man
is
a
gentleman
nor
does
it
make
his
wife
a
lady
mother
is
a
lady
and
goes
in
the
very
best
society
in
chicago
said
barbara
society
does
not
make
the
lady
but
the
lady
makes
society
brewster
could
form
the
most
exclusive
set
in
chicago
if
she
cared
for
that
sort
of
thing
came
from
anne
curtly
but
it
would
take
money
my
dear
a
farmer
could
afford
an
exclusive
set
jeered
barbara
if
that
is
the
case
the
brewsters
could
ride
on
chicago
very
crest
but
they
never
brag
about
their
money
laughed
anne
sarcastically
barbara
breath
was
suddenly
taken
away
by
this
news
but
she
recovered
enough
to
say
maliciously
oh
i
see
that
is
why
you
take
such
a
deep
interest
in
john
barbara
maynard
you
you
if
you
dare
say
another
word
like
that
to
anne
i
i
just
pull
your
hair
so
there
cried
eleanor
running
to
anne
and
throwing
her
arms
around
her
neck
barbara
felt
ashamed
of
her
words
but
she
was
too
proud
to
confess
it
so
she
tried
to
excuse
herself
by
saying
of
course
one
ca
be
expected
to
fall
right
in
with
folks
one
never
heard
of
before
anne
and
you
fancy
a
rural
existence
so
you
naturally
defend
everything
that
goes
with
it
but
i
shall
return
home
on
the
very
first
train
there
is
only
one
out
a
day
and
you
have
to
ask
a
favor
of
the
farmer
before
you
can
get
to
oak
creek
station
added
anne
with
a
bit
of
triumph
in
her
tone
having
relieved
her
heart
of
some
of
its
bitterness
anne
felt
sorry
for
barbara
so
she
endeavored
to
change
the
current
of
their
thoughts
she
went
to
the
window
to
raise
the
shade
as
far
as
it
would
go
and
was
struck
with
the
wonderful
sunset
sky
oh
girls
come
here
and
look
at
that
glory
eleanor
rushed
over
followed
by
barbara
who
never
wanted
to
miss
anything
good
all
irritation
was
forgotten
and
healed
as
they
stood
gazing
raptly
at
the
beautiful
view
the
cliffs
looked
as
if
volcanic
fires
were
again
burning
within
their
hearts
and
the
mist
from
the
valley
crept
up
to
form
an
illusion
of
smoke
rising
from
the
sharply
outlined
peaks
a
purple
haze
enveloped
the
mountains
and
the
streaks
in
the
sky
perfected
the
appearance
of
a
vast
eternal
fire
consuming
the
earth
the
sight
had
a
salutary
effect
on
the
girls
and
when
they
turned
from
the
window
it
was
with
the
old
friendship
restored
but
barbara
was
of
a
complaining
nature
and
must
have
something
to
find
fault
with
this
time
it
found
innocent
objects
to
bear
the
grumbling
where
are
we
expected
to
sleep
both
in
the
same
bed
of
course
is
it
big
enough
why
i
never
saw
such
a
wide
bed
large
enough
to
hold
a
dozen
of
us
said
eleanor
where
is
your
room
anne
barbara
asked
ignoring
her
sister
remark
i
sleep
here
on
the
sofa
admitted
anne
fearing
another
scene
sofa
impossible
exclaimed
barbara
it
is
a
you
know
it
opens
into
the
nicest
bed
explained
anne
taking
hold
of
the
loop
that
was
partly
hidden
in
the
deep
crease
formed
by
the
meeting
of
the
seat
and
back
watch
me
i
give
a
hard
tug
and
presto
the
upper
half
of
the
seat
swings
open
and
turns
over
like
this
there
we
have
a
wide
bed
with
mattress
and
all
that
goes
to
form
a
comfortable
resting
place
anne
demonstrated
her
words
and
the
city
girls
saw
a
low
bed
opened
before
their
wondering
eyes
the
pillows
and
bedding
were
neatly
folded
and
kept
in
a
long
shallow
drawer
under
the
sofa
how
awful
to
sleep
on
that
cried
barbara
it
looks
like
great
fun
may
i
sleep
here
anne
said
eleanor
indeed
you
shall
not
you
will
sleep
with
snapped
barbara
then
turning
to
anne
again
she
added
where
are
the
wardrobes
those
curtains
hide
the
shelves
we
will
use
you
will
find
nails
driven
into
the
board
against
the
wall
what
hang
our
expensive
clothes
on
these
common
nails
with
only
a
calico
drapery
to
protect
them
gasped
barbara
leave
your
expensive
clothes
in
the
trunks
then
i
am
laughed
eleanor
nolla
i
will
need
all
of
this
one
for
myself
anne
and
you
will
have
to
share
the
other
one
between
you
remarked
barbara
i
thought
you
were
leaving
on
the
early
train
teased
eleanor
quickly
to
avoid
another
quarrel
anne
hastily
said
oh
i
forgot
about
the
trunks
what
shall
i
tell
mr
brewster
tell
him
anything
you
like
about
nolla
but
leave
mine
where
the
man
can
pick
them
up
readily
when
i
leave
returned
barbara
in
a
nonchalant
manner
how
about
the
price
of
the
ticket
to
chicago
you
know
we
have
more
than
a
dollar
between
us
suggested
eleanor
dryly
barbara
had
evidently
forgotten
the
fact
but
she
was
equal
to
the
emergency
i
telegraph
to
the
bank
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
and
have
them
wire
me
the
money
during
this
animated
argument
in
the
a
family
gathering
formed
on
the
porch
of
the
house
mary
what
shall
we
do
with
those
seven
huge
trunks
asked
brewster
quizzically
watching
polly
seven
why
paw
exclaimed
polly
instantly
picturing
the
wonderful
things
those
trunks
held
creations
such
as
she
had
pored
over
in
the
farm
journal
fashion
notes
i
do
know
sam
unless
we
leave
them
in
the
wagon
until
the
girls
decide
what
they
wish
done
with
them
replied
brewster
sary
overheard
the
conversation
and
now
ran
out
to
see
whether
there
really
could
be
seven
trunks
laws
me
ah
never
see
sech
trunks
all
bulgy
at
one
side
and
all
them
brass
locks
they
are
wardrobe
trunks
sary
remarked
brewster
sary
deigned
no
reply
to
the
information
but
vented
a
bit
of
her
ire
against
the
by
shrugging
her
great
shoulders
and
saying
ef
ah
miss
brewster
ah
shore
pitch
them
trunks
clar
over
th
line
inta
wyomin
state
whar
th
injuns
kin
scramble
fer
th
fancy
duds
oh
sary
i
smell
the
scorching
cried
brewster
suddenly
knowing
the
quickest
way
to
rid
herself
of
sary
anne
stewart
now
came
out
and
saw
the
group
looking
at
the
wagon
the
girls
wo
bother
to
unpack
brewster
so
we
may
as
well
leave
the
trunks
in
the
wagon
and
take
them
to
the
barn
jeb
was
sent
to
the
barn
with
the
wagon
and
contents
and
brewster
retired
to
the
back
of
the
kitchen
where
he
washed
his
face
and
hands
in
a
tin
basin
he
had
dried
his
hair
and
face
when
sary
called
to
her
mistress
that
the
meal
was
ready
polly
and
her
mother
added
the
last
touches
to
the
table
when
brewster
came
to
the
door
saying
well
ah
ready
maw
run
and
call
the
girls
polly
i
think
anne
went
to
tell
them
about
the
trunks
said
brewster
unwillingly
polly
obeyed
and
rapped
on
the
door
supper
waiting
while
polly
was
absent
on
her
errand
jeb
came
into
the
kitchen
took
a
towel
from
its
peg
on
the
back
of
the
door
and
his
from
a
small
cabinet
in
the
corner
with
these
toilet
articles
he
went
out
again
to
the
where
the
crude
oak
bench
held
the
basin
and
soap
the
pump
was
nearby
and
jeb
filled
the
basin
quickly
and
proceeded
to
immerse
his
whole
head
unfortunately
at
the
moment
the
city
maidens
reached
the
kitchen
door
leading
from
the
jeb
was
guggling
loudly
then
he
stood
up
and
snorted
as
he
shook
his
mane
free
from
the
streaming
water
eleanor
turned
toward
anne
with
a
smile
of
amusement
on
her
face
but
barbara
expressed
her
disgust
with
an
emphatic
ugh
polly
saw
and
heard
but
failed
to
understand
as
she
had
been
gradually
accustomed
to
jeb
and
his
uncouth
ways
but
brewster
comprehended
the
shock
it
must
have
been
to
the
city
girls
and
tried
to
cover
the
unfortunate
incident
anne
will
you
seat
your
friends
at
that
side
of
the
table
polly
and
i
will
sit
on
this
side
brewster
always
sits
at
the
head
you
know
and
i
leave
the
other
end
for
sary
as
it
is
nearest
the
stove
where
she
can
reach
it
without
walking
so
far
jeb
came
in
and
immediately
pulled
out
a
chair
and
sat
down
in
his
accustomed
place
regardless
of
the
standing
ladies
barbara
looked
on
in
amazement
but
said
nothing
she
was
past
words
as
they
all
sat
down
eleanor
happened
to
catch
her
sister
eye
and
expression
and
turned
suddenly
to
anne
anne
too
had
seen
the
horror
on
barbara
face
as
jeb
reached
over
the
table
for
a
spoon
sary
had
forgotten
to
place
beside
his
plate
eleanor
raised
the
napkin
to
hide
her
laughing
face
but
brewster
construed
the
act
to
be
one
of
reverence
and
he
approved
of
such
tendencies
in
the
young
consequently
he
hastened
to
say
grace
barbara
sat
throughout
the
lengthy
prayer
because
she
felt
so
rebellious
at
everything
and
with
everything
that
she
would
pay
heed
to
the
usual
courtesy
at
the
moment
brewster
said
amen
sary
carried
the
large
from
the
stove
and
was
about
to
ladle
the
soup
into
the
bowls
when
barbara
said
icily
none
for
me
thank
you
jeb
was
tying
his
napkin
about
his
neck
but
at
such
a
surprising
refusal
he
gaped
at
the
stranger
however
the
fact
that
his
own
was
now
placed
before
him
ended
the
speechless
shock
he
began
eating
at
once
and
the
three
boarders
watched
him
scoop
up
the
liquid
as
if
his
life
depended
upon
finishing
the
work
the
amount
of
noise
he
made
while
accomplishing
the
feat
was
a
revelation
to
the
maynard
girls
and
mortifying
to
brewster
sary
concluded
her
serving
and
sat
down
to
enjoy
her
own
meal
she
used
the
blade
of
her
knife
as
a
shovel
and
the
as
a
pick
when
she
was
not
spearing
or
loading
food
upon
either
she
was
using
the
silver
as
an
eloquent
means
of
expressing
her
conversation
which
was
voluble
the
moment
supper
ended
brewster
remarked
the
trunks
are
safe
in
the
barn
whenever
you
need
them
you
can
tell
jeb
and
he
will
see
that
they
are
carried
in
for
you
thank
you
but
i
shall
have
them
taken
back
to
oak
creek
as
i
have
no
idea
of
remaining
to
spoil
my
summer
returned
barbara
haughtily
brewster
made
no
reply
but
excused
himself
and
went
out
to
the
wide
steps
of
the
front
porch
where
he
sat
down
to
watch
the
peaceful
twilight
as
it
crept
slowly
over
the
mountain
peaks
here
the
rest
of
the
family
soon
joined
him
and
the
wonderful
western
night
as
the
brilliant
stars
sparkled
seemingly
so
near
to
earth
had
its
soothing
effect
on
the
perturbed
hearts
and
minds
of
all
present
when
brewster
finally
mentioned
that
it
was
the
individuals
in
the
group
felt
more
amiably
disposed
towards
each
other
anne
stewart
was
awake
bright
and
early
in
the
morning
and
finding
the
sisters
sleeping
soundly
crept
out
to
enjoy
the
invigorating
breezes
blowing
down
from
the
some
time
later
eleanor
sat
up
and
rubbed
her
eyes
at
a
loss
to
remember
where
she
was
after
a
moment
however
she
saw
the
sofa
and
laughed
merrily
oh
wo
you
be
quiet
what
is
the
matter
with
you
complained
barbara
sleepily
nothing
i
feel
so
alive
get
up
and
hear
the
birds
sing
replied
eleanor
springing
out
of
bed
and
running
over
to
the
window
oh
bob
look
at
the
dazzling
over
there
i
suppose
these
cool
breezes
come
straight
from
those
exclaimed
eleanor
i
may
as
well
get
up
or
you
cause
a
riot
of
noise
answered
barbara
querulously
of
course
i
will
i
slept
so
well
that
i
could
dance
on
a
trapeze
just
now
how
did
you
sleep
why
what
does
it
matter
to
you
countered
barbara
peevishly
matter
why
that
bed
removes
one
of
the
obstacles
to
your
remaining
here
laughed
eleanor
triumphantly
barbara
would
not
admit
that
she
had
never
slept
better
nor
would
she
prevaricate
so
she
merely
said
i
am
going
to
oak
creek
the
moment
we
finish
breakfast
and
wire
father
bank
for
money
might
as
well
find
out
first
if
you
can
use
the
team
and
wagon
jeb
only
goes
to
town
when
anything
has
to
be
had
here
or
shipped
away
by
train
a
trip
of
twelve
miles
is
not
a
trifle
every
day
in
the
week
remarked
eleanor
i
ride
a
horse
to
oak
creek
myself
i
not
stand
this
awful
place
another
day
declared
barbara
you
ca
ride
a
horse
without
its
owner
permission
besides
added
eleanor
as
an
afterthought
occurred
to
her
you
only
have
your
new
traveling
suit
and
the
little
light
summer
frock
here
the
trunks
are
going
back
to
oak
creek
you
said
and
your
riding
habit
is
in
one
of
them
barbara
made
no
reply
to
this
statement
and
eleanor
drew
on
her
stockings
and
then
sought
for
her
shoes
which
she
had
playfully
aimed
at
anne
stewart
the
night
previous
one
was
found
by
the
bureau
and
the
other
was
seen
under
the
window
she
ran
over
to
pick
up
the
one
by
the
window
oh
bob
come
here
quick
what
is
it
cried
barbara
hastily
running
over
to
join
her
sister
my
the
sun
has
just
touched
those
peaks
i
never
saw
anything
so
dazzlingly
beautiful
sighed
eleanor
lost
in
contemplation
of
the
sight
barbara
also
stood
watching
the
glancing
over
the
towering
peaks
and
then
she
said
apologetically
i
never
said
the
was
wonderful
it
is
but
one
can
not
thrive
on
mountains
or
associate
with
views
still
it
goes
a
long
way
towards
creating
environment
while
the
atmosphere
and
friendships
are
up
to
the
individual
retorted
eleanor
oh
well
you
have
the
knack
of
making
friends
with
any
one
but
i
am
more
reserved
and
ideal
in
nature
so
i
simply
can
not
accommodate
myself
to
such
people
and
places
as
this
no
but
you
can
accommodate
yourself
to
some
society
youth
who
hangs
over
your
chair
and
tells
foolish
fibs
to
feed
your
vanity
scorned
eleanor
another
sisterly
scene
might
have
ensued
had
not
anne
entered
the
room
at
this
critical
time
girls
better
hurry
and
finish
dressing
as
breakfast
is
almost
ready
to
serve
said
she
after
a
pleasant
morning
greeting
how
long
have
you
been
up
asked
barbara
oh
an
hour
or
more
i
succeeded
in
working
out
a
scheme
i
had
to
make
things
pleasanter
for
every
one
and
i
want
you
to
hurry
and
approve
of
it
chapter
vii
a
little
scheme
that
worked
anne
lay
with
closed
eyes
for
a
long
time
revolving
many
plans
for
the
ultimate
harmony
of
that
summer
and
when
she
finally
allowed
herself
to
sleep
she
had
a
scheme
that
she
was
going
to
try
the
next
day
as
she
came
from
her
room
early
in
the
morning
she
spied
polly
sitting
disconsolately
on
the
she
went
over
and
sat
down
beside
her
polly
i
can
not
blame
you
for
wishing
we
had
never
come
but
now
that
we
are
here
let
us
see
if
we
can
not
make
something
out
of
the
tangle
of
disappointments
eleanor
will
love
the
place
at
once
as
she
is
so
much
like
you
in
nature
dear
but
bob
always
grumbles
over
things
at
first
no
matter
where
or
what
it
is
she
feels
that
she
is
not
showing
her
superiority
if
she
is
not
condemning
what
she
comes
in
contact
with
it
really
is
a
disease
polly
and
i
have
tried
to
cure
her
of
it
this
last
year
i
am
hoping
for
great
things
for
her
during
this
season
but
i
feel
that
i
must
confide
in
you
to
let
you
know
just
what
the
trouble
is
bob
will
make
a
fine
woman
if
this
hateful
tendency
is
uprooted
in
time
polly
smiled
wanly
and
anne
wise
young
teacher
changed
the
subject
then
what
a
pity
one
has
to
waste
such
glorious
views
and
delightful
weather
while
sitting
at
breakfast
in
the
kitchen
where
would
you
eat
it
laughed
polly
looking
with
amusement
at
her
companion
why
under
that
lovely
group
of
oaks
to
be
sure
replied
the
teacher
pointing
at
the
trees
that
shaded
the
grass
plot
and
at
the
side
of
the
house
under
the
trees
certainly
what
do
you
suppose
they
were
grown
for
if
not
for
our
uplift
and
joy
why
miss
stewart
how
funny
of
you
who
ever
heard
of
having
meals
except
at
picnics
laughed
polly
every
one
who
can
now
prefers
to
a
stuffy
room
on
summer
days
replied
anne
calmly
but
watching
the
effect
of
her
words
satisfied
with
polly
expression
she
added
did
you
ever
read
about
the
garden
parties
of
society
people
and
the
trend
to
live
on
wide
porches
and
at
every
opportunity
your
magazines
ought
to
be
full
of
such
accounts
oh
yes
in
magazines
but
i
never
dreamed
it
was
true
i
studied
every
plan
and
picture
i
seen
in
the
magazines
and
i
loved
to
picture
the
beautiful
places
and
furnishings
they
speak
of
anne
had
heard
from
polly
brother
john
how
his
sister
studied
every
item
on
decorating
that
could
be
found
in
papers
or
periodicals
but
anne
did
not
know
that
polly
really
had
a
latent
talent
in
this
line
nor
how
ambitious
she
was
to
express
art
and
beauty
in
the
home
that
is
what
i
like
to
try
here
have
our
meals
out
under
those
trees
it
wo
make
much
extra
work
as
the
spot
is
very
convenient
to
the
kitchen
door
but
we
will
avoid
the
heat
and
steam
from
the
stove
and
cooking
and
have
much
more
room
too
i
do
suppose
it
makes
much
difference
where
we
eat
as
long
as
we
get
it
over
with
as
soon
as
possible
returned
polly
that
just
the
trouble
with
most
people
they
merely
eat
because
they
feel
they
have
to
but
they
never
stop
to
make
of
the
habit
an
opportunity
to
improve
themselves
and
enjoy
a
social
meeting
with
each
other
we
may
as
well
be
zulus
and
eat
with
our
fingers
maybe
the
zulus
would
prove
more
ideal
for
their
home
teachings
than
we
really
are
polly
laughed
again
at
anne
words
but
the
latter
added
it
true
polly
how
many
people
trouble
themselves
to
eat
politely
and
act
or
talk
from
the
highest
motives
the
zulus
follow
traditional
customs
if
we
did
we
would
follow
the
refined
court
manners
of
our
english
and
dutch
ancestors
instead
we
are
in
such
haste
to
eat
and
get
back
to
the
business
of
making
money
that
we
lose
all
the
pleasure
along
the
way
there
polly
listened
anxiously
and
understood
that
anne
was
gently
criticizing
what
she
saw
and
heard
in
the
kitchen
the
night
before
anne
watched
polly
face
and
knew
she
comprehended
then
she
continued
if
we
have
breakfast
in
the
open
air
it
will
be
much
cooler
for
every
one
and
sary
need
not
stop
her
routine
work
on
account
of
our
being
in
her
way
in
the
kitchen
if
we
help
and
wait
on
ourselves
sary
need
not
be
delayed
by
our
tardiness
in
appearing
at
table
miss
stewart
i
think
you
right
and
one
good
thing
about
eating
out
here
is
that
we
wo
feel
crowded
together
with
nothing
to
look
at
but
each
other
at
least
we
have
the
mountains
if
we
make
the
our
new
anne
laughed
at
the
manner
of
polly
approval
and
said
yes
polly
the
mountains
are
great
and
wonderful
and
so
silent
besides
let
go
now
and
ask
maw
what
she
thinks
of
the
plan
in
a
moment
polly
you
know
i
am
anxious
to
help
you
in
every
way
and
to
teach
you
if
you
express
yourself
poorly
yes
that
the
only
good
thing
about
this
awful
visit
admitted
the
girl
then
allow
me
to
correct
an
error
in
speech
if
you
wish
to
go
to
denver
high
this
fall
i
want
you
to
use
refined
expressions
anne
looked
at
her
companion
and
smiled
kindly
and
polly
said
oh
i
be
so
glad
to
correct
any
mistakes
tell
me
what
just
now
you
called
your
mother
and
i
have
heard
you
call
your
father
they
are
western
terms
but
they
are
not
considered
correct
or
refined
elsewhere
the
name
of
father
or
mother
is
a
term
of
respect
and
loving
reverence
from
the
children
i
would
like
to
have
you
accustom
yourself
to
the
use
of
these
titles
for
your
parents
and
see
how
the
very
sound
of
it
will
cause
you
to
more
affection
polly
weighed
this
news
thoughtfully
but
she
was
surprised
at
the
information
that
her
customary
maw
and
paw
were
not
the
most
desirable
terms
to
use
she
knew
that
anne
stewart
knew
better
than
she
what
was
the
proper
manner
of
speech
and
she
thanked
her
for
her
interest
in
helping
her
then
another
thing
i
want
you
to
do
polly
is
that
you
call
me
i
am
to
be
with
you
as
one
of
the
family
all
this
summer
and
the
is
too
formal
for
members
in
the
same
family
i
want
to
ask
this
favor
of
your
mother
and
father
too
if
you
were
to
use
and
barbara
first
names
for
them
as
i
do
i
think
they
would
feel
more
at
home
oh
miss
i
mean
anne
i
will
love
to
call
you
that
but
i
never
have
courage
enough
to
call
that
proud
girl
by
the
name
of
declared
polly
anne
laughed
and
patted
her
apt
pupil
on
the
head
then
she
said
shall
we
go
in
search
of
your
mother
and
ask
about
the
breakfast
table
polly
jumped
up
and
led
the
way
to
the
kitchen
door
where
sary
was
hard
at
work
sary
can
you
tell
us
where
my
mother
is
asked
polly
your
maw
just
went
to
th
buttery
to
skim
the
milk
said
she
giving
polly
an
opportunity
to
compare
the
two
terms
as
the
two
girls
went
toward
the
buttery
polly
admitted
anne
it
does
make
a
difference
i
think
anne
nodded
brightly
and
opened
the
brewster
stood
with
skimmer
in
hand
taking
the
rich
cream
from
the
pans
of
milk
she
looked
up
with
a
welcoming
smile
as
the
two
girls
came
in
mother
anne
been
giving
me
aid
in
manners
laughed
polly
watching
her
mother
expression
keenly
in
which
line
dear
there
are
several
you
can
improve
in
rejoined
brewster
with
a
loving
little
laugh
did
you
hear
me
i
have
improved
upon
your
name
i
noticed
it
but
i
wanted
to
make
sure
it
was
intentional
and
not
a
mistake
tell
me
do
you
like
it
asked
polly
eagerly
indeed
i
do
dear
i
never
could
abide
that
name
of
and
that
is
common
with
the
ranchers
then
why
did
you
tell
me
this
long
ago
oh
mother
if
i
corrected
you
and
the
other
children
at
school
heard
you
use
different
terms
from
those
they
were
accustomed
to
they
would
think
you
and
good
for
a
rancher
i
have
heard
that
criticism
so
often
that
i
have
given
up
trying
to
better
conditions
or
express
my
own
desires
in
anything
that
an
illiterate
and
inexperienced
neighbor
may
find
fault
with
i
just
accept
things
as
they
are
now
but
hope
for
better
things
for
my
children
this
was
a
new
light
on
her
mother
and
polly
felt
subdued
by
it
she
wondered
if
her
mother
would
have
been
any
different
if
she
had
been
in
maynard
place
you
see
continued
brewster
turning
to
anne
one
so
gets
to
dread
the
free
speech
and
opinions
of
some
ranchers
that
one
forbears
in
rather
than
have
strife
and
from
those
one
must
meet
at
times
anne
nodded
but
sometimes
it
is
better
to
take
the
risk
of
offending
the
whole
community
if
one
finally
wins
out
brewster
looked
approvingly
at
the
girl
and
polly
changed
the
conversation
by
saying
mother
anne
and
i
have
a
plan
that
will
surprise
you
brewster
smiled
encouragingly
for
the
girls
to
speak
it
just
this
we
think
it
will
be
lovely
to
move
the
table
out
under
the
trees
there
the
air
and
view
can
be
enjoyed
and
afford
us
ample
subjects
for
conversation
explained
anne
anne
splendid
after
my
experience
of
last
night
i
would
hail
any
change
but
this
is
really
good
i
never
thought
of
it
myself
replied
brewster
with
relief
on
their
walk
to
the
kitchen
they
planned
to
remove
the
table
and
chairs
then
brewster
added
my
husband
breakfasted
an
hour
ago
but
said
he
would
be
back
when
we
sat
down
for
coffee
he
enjoys
a
second
cup
at
his
leisure
and
i
quite
sure
sary
gave
jeb
his
breakfast
after
i
left
the
kitchen
so
that
gives
us
a
clear
start
for
the
first
meal
sary
was
found
upon
her
knees
before
the
kitchen
range
polishing
the
nickel
on
the
oven
door
a
of
hot
water
and
a
scrubbing
brush
stood
upon
the
floor
beside
her
as
brewster
came
in
sary
glanced
up
impatiently
ah
t
goodness
ah
wish
eat
that
brekfus
an
vamoose
outen
my
way
ah
hes
t
scrub
this
hull
floor
soon
ez
th
shined
that
exactly
why
i
came
in
sary
to
get
breakfast
out
of
your
way
returned
brewster
sending
a
swift
glance
at
polly
and
anne
as
sary
words
made
way
for
their
work
all
fell
to
with
a
vim
polly
and
anne
carried
dishes
and
chairs
out
of
the
room
while
brewster
whisked
off
the
cloth
and
asked
the
maid
to
help
her
carry
the
table
out
under
the
trees
no
reply
came
from
sary
and
the
mistress
turned
to
see
why
she
did
not
come
to
assist
the
ludicrous
expression
on
the
widow
face
as
she
sat
bolt
upright
with
her
blackened
hands
raised
heavenward
in
silent
protest
made
brewster
laugh
what
the
matter
sary
yore
a
clar
case
o
bein
locoed
gasped
the
help
not
at
all
but
you
want
to
scrub
the
floor
do
you
ah
do
need
th
furnishin
taken
out
fer
that
but
we
want
to
eat
you
see
and
under
the
trees
we
be
quite
out
of
your
way
here
anne
help
me
with
the
table
will
you
please
said
brewster
with
finality
the
table
was
firmly
placed
under
the
trees
and
the
cloth
relaid
then
the
willowware
dishes
and
old
tuttle
silver
were
arranged
by
anne
while
polly
watched
eagerly
i
do
believe
those
old
blue
dishes
look
ten
times
as
nice
out
here
as
in
the
kitchen
declared
polly
while
anne
placed
a
few
wild
flowers
on
the
center
of
the
table
merely
the
effect
of
your
mental
testimony
polly
in
the
kitchen
with
steam
working
utensils
and
crowed
sense
of
room
everything
takes
on
a
sordid
look
and
feeling
but
out
in
god
sunshine
and
fresh
air
everything
looks
and
feels
better
that
is
why
sun
and
air
are
the
best
physician
for
any
ill
explained
anne
brewster
heard
and
watched
anne
with
a
bright
smile
as
the
sentiment
of
the
words
were
exactly
what
she
ofttimes
thought
when
the
three
returned
to
the
kitchen
to
take
the
biscuits
and
other
breakfast
food
out
sary
stood
with
head
thrown
back
and
body
rocking
back
and
forth
as
she
laughed
immoderately
do
tell
mis
brewster
bea
goin
t
out
thar
now
be
yuh
why
of
course
retorted
polly
why
should
we
asked
brewster
sary
could
not
explain
so
she
turned
to
the
stove
while
mumbling
to
herself
the
doubts
she
had
over
the
sanity
of
the
of
this
queer
family
excepting
herself
of
course
anne
had
gone
to
the
to
call
the
girls
and
to
her
relief
found
them
both
dressed
and
ready
for
breakfast
it
a
lovely
morning
said
she
in
greeting
to
them
yes
i
been
sniffing
the
sweetness
at
the
open
window
replied
eleanor
but
barbara
stood
unresponsive
anne
noticed
the
they
wore
and
felt
relieved
at
the
simplicity
of
color
and
lines
although
she
knew
that
the
inside
of
those
dresses
spoke
silently
of
their
cost
we
going
to
breakfast
out
on
the
lawn
it
is
perfectly
charming
there
explained
anne
leading
the
way
from
the
by
way
of
the
front
door
in
order
to
avoid
sary
and
her
but
sary
had
been
anxiously
peeping
from
the
crack
of
the
kitchen
door
and
felt
mortally
offended
when
the
company
went
out
by
the
front
way
was
it
not
enough
that
the
folks
were
too
far
removed
from
the
kitchen
to
permit
sary
to
overhear
what
was
said
at
table
but
now
they
have
to
walk
out
at
the
sunday
door
so
thought
the
widow
as
she
left
her
back
of
the
door
and
stood
watching
from
the
open
window
by
the
cupboard
every
one
seemed
in
a
pleasanter
mood
than
that
of
the
previous
evening
and
as
breakfast
advanced
eleanor
went
so
far
as
to
ask
her
sister
to
remain
at
the
ranch
a
few
days
at
least
and
barbara
although
she
would
not
admit
it
knew
the
bed
was
exceptionally
good
and
the
breakfast
most
enjoyable
while
the
air
and
scenery
were
simply
wonderful
when
brewster
came
along
the
path
leading
from
the
barn
he
stood
near
a
lilac
bush
for
a
few
moments
watching
the
pretty
group
under
the
trees
but
he
could
understand
having
breakfast
outside
the
usual
place
the
kitchen
is
this
a
picnic
asked
he
at
length
coming
forward
good
morning
paw
father
is
this
fun
cried
polly
brewster
and
anne
exchanged
glances
at
polly
error
and
correction
but
sam
brewster
failed
to
notice
the
new
term
he
bowed
to
the
three
guests
and
smilingly
took
the
chair
his
wife
placed
for
him
at
the
table
while
brewster
poured
his
coffee
she
remarked
this
is
and
anne
idea
is
it
sensible
and
much
pleasanter
than
in
the
stuffy
kitchen
he
nodded
approval
and
polly
felt
satisfied
then
as
her
father
sipped
his
fragrant
coffee
she
said
anne
was
just
saying
that
i
ought
to
show
them
the
rainbow
cliffs
after
breakfast
it
so
clear
ah
would
be
surprised
but
what
will
see
pagoda
peak
and
grizzly
slide
from
the
cliffs
polly
added
brewster
if
we
can
they
like
it
it
a
wonderful
sight
anne
with
the
sun
shining
on
the
crests
explained
polly
and
then
you
can
take
them
over
there
some
day
polly
a
good
lunch
can
be
packed
into
choko
panniers
and
with
horses
the
ride
will
be
most
delightful
added
brewster
maw
you
can
go
too
you
agreed
to
take
things
easy
you
know
reminded
her
husband
oh
sam
riding
over
the
flat
top
mountains
would
be
the
hardest
work
for
me
these
days
laughed
brewster
pshaw
now
you
used
to
ride
better
than
any
in
these
parts
and
you
ca
tell
me
those
days
are
past
argued
brewster
dropping
the
habit
of
using
western
terms
in
his
eagerness
i
heard
of
brewster
famous
riding
now
chimed
in
anne
she
can
ride
pa
father
or
any
one
i
ever
saw
polly
maintained
brewster
shook
her
head
in
a
vain
effort
to
discourage
such
praise
then
she
turned
to
the
maynard
girls
saying
do
you
understand
western
horses
they
are
rather
difficult
at
times
you
know
we
ride
daily
when
in
chicago
said
barbara
boastfully
but
city
horses
are
mere
nags
bob
these
animals
accustomed
to
roaming
the
plains
are
something
worth
while
you
will
find
laughed
anne
i
advise
your
going
to
the
corral
and
having
jeb
try
out
the
horses
for
you
before
you
undertake
any
long
jaunt
suggested
brewster
we
can
visit
the
cliffs
this
morning
and
try
riding
this
afternoon
added
polly
eagerly
then
bob
and
i
will
have
to
get
our
habits
from
one
of
the
trunks
in
the
barn
said
eleanor
bob
and
you
run
along
and
do
that
while
polly
and
i
make
the
beds
and
clear
away
the
breakfast
ventured
anne
looking
at
brewster
barbara
seemed
as
interested
as
any
one
so
barbara
and
eleanor
followed
brewster
to
the
barn
to
point
out
the
trunk
they
wanted
to
open
while
polly
cleared
the
table
and
brewster
went
with
anne
to
make
the
beds
as
they
worked
in
the
they
exchanged
confidences
about
the
two
visitors
it
seems
the
lovely
morning
has
had
a
salutary
effect
on
feelings
regarding
pebbly
pit
ventured
anne
i
hope
so
replied
brewster
diffidently
you
see
eleanor
is
more
like
her
father
but
bob
takes
too
much
after
her
mother
to
adapt
herself
readily
to
such
a
radical
change
as
a
ranch
continued
anne
apologetically
eleanor
appears
to
be
a
nice
girl
bob
will
shortly
be
as
satisfied
as
nolla
but
she
just
ca
let
go
of
herself
and
her
foolish
training
in
a
minute
if
we
have
a
few
pleasant
outings
to
show
her
how
really
wonderful
the
country
is
she
will
open
out
in
her
natural
sweet
self
it
certainly
is
a
pleasant
surprise
to
expect
a
modern
fashionable
summer
resort
and
then
find
a
forgotten
nook
in
the
pit
of
an
extinct
volcano
laughed
brewster
humorously
yes
bob
was
terribly
upset
last
night
i
fancy
she
was
regretting
those
seven
trunks
filled
with
expensive
clothes
added
anne
smiling
at
the
remembrance
i
ca
but
wonder
that
such
a
sensible
girl
as
you
seem
to
be
can
be
so
fond
of
a
girl
so
different
from
you
in
every
way
remarked
brewster
looking
anne
in
the
eyes
anne
flushed
when
you
know
her
as
i
do
you
will
see
that
she
really
is
not
snobbish
but
only
assumes
it
as
i
said
she
is
the
result
of
silly
training
by
a
society
mother
i
have
seen
the
genuine
nature
buried
by
habits
and
i
am
willing
to
help
her
bring
it
out
to
establish
it
permanently
nolla
will
develop
herself
if
she
is
allowed
to
express
herself
without
constant
ridicule
or
reprimands
this
summer
ought
to
do
wonders
for
both
those
girls
brewster
showed
her
approval
by
nodding
her
head
affirmatively
at
anne
you
had
ample
time
to
study
the
two
girls
last
winter
when
they
were
in
denver
i
suppose
suggested
brewster
yes
i
was
with
them
most
of
the
time
and
the
result
of
the
erroneous
influence
over
bob
was
always
noticeable
after
a
short
visit
from
maynard
she
only
visited
her
daughters
twice
in
the
eight
months
but
it
was
generally
so
unpleasant
a
time
for
every
one
that
we
were
relieved
that
she
had
too
many
social
engagements
to
come
oftener
anne
bent
down
to
tuck
in
the
sheets
as
she
spoke
so
frankly
concerning
her
friends
mother
but
i
must
not
disparage
maynard
in
your
eyes
you
may
find
in
her
many
fine
qualities
that
have
been
hidden
from
me
quickly
added
anne
fearing
she
had
given
her
hostess
a
wrong
idea
perhaps
they
are
hidden
very
deep
anne
laughed
maynard
is
just
splendid
he
is
so
must
have
found
the
good
qualities
in
his
wife
and
she
doubtless
permitted
herself
to
be
misled
by
vain
aspirations
to
reach
a
social
height
offered
by
her
husband
success
in
business
love
is
blind
anne
when
a
man
fancies
himself
in
love
with
a
pretty
girl
he
seldom
seeks
for
lasting
qualities
or
a
strong
character
he
accepts
the
transitory
beauty
as
the
real
thing
and
wakes
up
too
late
to
find
he
entertained
a
dream
i
think
you
and
i
feel
alike
in
this
problem
my
friends
laugh
at
my
what
they
call
unreasonable
opinions
on
marriage
said
anne
eagerly
inviting
a
discussion
with
brewster
some
other
day
anne
we
still
have
the
task
before
us
of
acclimating
the
city
girls
laughed
brewster
taking
anne
by
the
arm
and
leading
her
from
the
room
chapter
viii
acclimating
the
city
girls
waiting
for
me
girls
called
anne
joining
her
friends
we
just
got
back
from
the
barn
said
eleanor
showing
the
habits
which
she
had
over
her
arms
well
take
them
to
the
room
and
change
your
shoes
we
must
wear
boots
for
walking
about
this
place
you
know
returned
anne
noting
that
eleanor
carried
both
habits
doing
her
sister
work
for
her
as
usual
good
gracious
i
forgot
to
unpack
the
walking
shoes
wo
these
cuban
heels
answer
cried
barbara
impatiently
they
might
answer
for
a
twisted
ankle
laughed
anne
then
we
postpone
the
walk
till
said
barbara
decisively
not
me
i
going
to
the
cliffs
if
i
walk
in
fact
not
so
sure
but
that
will
be
the
most
delightful
thing
to
do
said
eleanor
sitting
down
to
unbutton
her
shoes
nolla
stop
disgracing
us
so
cried
barbara
shocked
well
i
want
to
see
those
cliffs
at
close
range
if
you
start
for
home
or
maybe
this
afternoon
if
you
find
the
cliffs
disappointing
i
can
at
least
take
back
the
remembrance
of
the
wonderful
spot
pouted
eleanor
to
avoid
the
usual
argument
between
the
sisters
anne
quickly
made
a
suggestion
bob
feet
seem
to
be
about
the
same
size
as
mine
and
she
can
have
my
tennis
shoes
for
this
walk
and
polly
feet
look
about
my
size
why
ca
i
borrow
a
pair
of
her
country
shoes
added
eleanor
eagerly
nolla
your
feet
are
very
slim
while
polly
are
broad
as
are
most
country
girls
you
would
ruin
your
feet
in
clumsy
shoes
exclaimed
barbara
polly
looked
appealingly
at
her
mother
so
she
came
to
the
rescue
i
have
always
been
very
careful
of
polly
feet
as
i
can
see
no
advantage
in
ruining
a
child
feet
hence
you
will
find
polly
shoes
are
made
by
a
shoemaker
do
they
have
such
things
in
oak
creek
came
sarcastically
from
barbara
do
they
have
them
in
denver
and
chicago
retorted
anne
naturally
in
chicago
to
meet
the
need
for
our
class
and
barbara
tossed
her
head
defiantly
polly
run
and
find
those
last
shoes
we
had
made
on
the
scientific
last
plan
came
from
brewster
polly
vanished
and
anne
ran
to
her
room
for
the
tennis
shoes
barbara
walked
away
and
stood
on
the
terrace
looking
at
the
peaks
eleanor
and
brewster
glanced
at
each
other
and
finding
a
similar
expression
in
each
other
eyes
both
smiled
thereafter
a
better
understanding
existed
between
the
two
staring
up
at
mountains
ought
to
be
good
and
elevating
for
you
bob
began
eleanor
teasingly
when
anne
returned
here
bob
try
them
on
suggested
anne
holding
out
her
brand
new
tennis
shoes
then
polly
returned
with
a
neat
pair
of
boots
with
good
extension
soles
eleanor
took
them
turned
down
the
top
and
looked
at
the
label
she
threw
back
her
head
and
laughed
mockingly
what
a
blow
to
bob
pride
in
the
maynard
feet
here
we
have
to
come
to
pebbly
pit
and
find
our
pet
label
in
polly
shoes
i
sure
the
maynards
will
change
cobblers
hereafter
every
one
laughed
at
eleanor
but
barbara
occupied
herself
with
trying
on
anne
tennis
shoes
eleanor
sat
down
upon
the
grass
and
soon
had
on
polly
shoes
they
fit
to
a
dot
exclaimed
she
holding
out
one
foot
to
verify
her
statement
well
then
if
you
feel
you
can
wear
them
comfortably
do
let
start
before
some
other
delay
occurs
said
barbara
petulantly
the
four
young
folks
started
on
the
trail
that
wound
about
the
cliffs
and
brewster
went
indoors
to
cook
some
doughnuts
a
large
stone
crock
of
which
was
always
kept
in
the
pantry
the
walk
seemed
very
long
to
barbara
who
was
unaccustomed
to
much
walking
but
the
other
three
girls
reveled
in
the
exhilarating
air
and
bright
morning
sunshine
reaching
the
first
cliffs
polly
explained
about
the
volcanoes
of
that
section
of
colorado
and
showed
the
visitors
many
interesting
formations
of
lava
they
were
about
to
continue
to
the
giant
guards
when
barbara
complained
of
aching
feet
she
declared
it
was
the
rough
trail
and
not
her
tender
feet
that
caused
the
pain
and
ache
so
the
girls
sat
down
to
rest
while
polly
told
of
trips
to
other
volcanic
craters
and
peaks
they
were
about
to
start
on
their
way
again
when
the
echoes
of
a
lively
whistle
sounded
over
the
lava
walls
it
jeb
going
to
the
corral
to
find
our
horses
for
this
afternoon
explained
polly
leaning
out
over
a
fragment
of
lava
to
see
who
was
passing
by
but
jeb
did
not
pass
he
called
loudly
for
his
young
mistress
miss
ah
got
sumthin
fer
come
up
here
jeb
we
resting
on
the
giant
guards
shouted
polly
soon
jeb
appeared
on
the
edge
of
the
cliffs
and
held
out
a
huge
paper
bag
that
had
great
here
and
there
on
its
sides
and
bottom
yer
maw
hed
me
bring
these
dunnits
t
ez
ah
come
by
she
sez
fer
t
let
me
have
anudder
one
too
oh
they
are
still
warm
exclaimed
eleanor
as
polly
handed
her
one
from
the
bag
shore
but
that
makes
tas
better
declared
jeb
anxiously
watching
polly
hand
one
to
anne
next
and
one
to
barbara
before
remembering
him
they
horribly
greasy
things
said
barbara
holding
the
doughnut
fastidiously
with
the
tip
ends
of
her
fingers
mebbe
folks
call
by
anudder
name
ef
no
grease
war
used
t
cook
by
ah
likes
howsomeever
grease
an
all
returned
jeb
grinning
with
relief
as
polly
gave
him
two
large
ones
um
but
they
good
eleanor
smacked
her
lips
at
the
first
bite
i
ca
eat
mine
they
look
so
impossible
and
barbara
raised
her
hand
and
threw
her
doughnut
over
the
cliff
came
from
jeb
in
dismay
but
he
hurriedly
left
the
girls
polly
was
surprised
too
but
she
merely
said
we
never
waste
anything
worth
while
the
chickens
and
pigs
like
doughnuts
if
we
ever
have
any
left
for
them
anne
had
to
turn
away
to
hide
a
smile
and
at
that
moment
she
saw
jeb
at
the
foot
of
the
cliff
glancing
up
to
see
if
any
one
saw
him
pick
up
the
discarded
delicacy
from
the
ground
the
incident
over
the
doughnut
silenced
polly
as
she
led
the
way
between
the
two
giant
peaks
of
lava
they
reared
their
heads
more
than
sixty
feet
high
and
were
so
oddly
shaped
that
they
derived
their
names
of
giant
guards
from
the
spears
seemingly
held
out
from
the
shoulders
to
challenge
passersby
the
trail
leading
between
the
guards
was
not
more
than
six
feet
wide
but
immediately
after
passing
them
one
reached
a
of
cliffs
standing
about
a
natural
arena
opposite
the
trail
that
opened
on
this
arena
a
narrow
canyon
descended
gradually
away
out
of
sight
these
cliffs
forming
the
rim
of
the
bowl
are
called
the
tombstones
if
you
examine
them
closer
you
will
find
they
have
queer
faces
and
all
sorts
of
strange
patterns
traced
on
their
bodies
explained
polly
breaking
the
uncomfortable
silence
this
bowl
as
polly
calls
it
is
as
large
as
yale
campus
is
it
said
eleanor
hoping
to
establish
conversation
everything
about
pebbly
pit
is
on
a
large
scale
even
the
hearts
of
the
owners
added
anne
patting
polly
on
the
back
pardon
me
for
differing
anne
not
the
feet
of
the
owners
laughed
eleanor
sending
a
teasing
look
at
her
sister
mother
says
this
bowl
seems
to
have
been
a
small
crater
belonging
to
the
great
pit
yonder
when
the
volcano
was
active
in
the
centuries
long
gone
by
explained
polly
as
the
others
ignored
eleanor
remark
these
imps
certainly
are
strange
formations
some
with
arms
flung
high
as
if
in
defense
others
crouching
low
as
if
to
launch
an
arrow
at
the
enemy
and
see
those
erect
with
proud
mien
in
defiance
of
all
others
they
must
have
been
unvanquished
said
anne
interesting
barbara
in
spite
of
her
assumed
indifference
i
just
guess
they
were
so
cold
and
when
the
old
demon
spit
fire
at
them
from
the
active
volcano
said
eleanor
gazing
aloft
at
the
grotesque
heads
with
facial
forms
nolla
i
beg
of
you
to
use
better
english
you
know
how
mother
trembles
at
your
words
from
brother
rebuked
barbara
seemingly
shocked
at
her
sister
what
a
tale
these
imps
could
tell
us
of
remote
ages
when
they
were
flung
aside
as
useless
in
the
evolution
of
things
said
anne
diverting
a
possible
argument
i
say
anne
why
would
this
place
give
you
for
that
story
you
want
to
write
some
day
exclaimed
eleanor
unexpectedly
anne
flushed
and
polly
looked
at
her
in
surprise
barbara
seemed
amazed
too
is
this
something
i
never
heard
of
asked
the
latter
oh
no
i
once
said
to
nolla
that
i
should
love
to
be
able
to
write
a
story
and
she
assured
me
i
could
do
it
she
is
only
teasing
as
usual
laughed
anne
and
at
the
first
opportunity
she
managed
to
give
eleanor
a
smart
rap
on
the
shoulder
for
her
breach
of
confidence
leaving
the
imps
behind
polly
took
the
trail
that
led
to
the
causeway
the
ravine
that
cleft
two
towering
peaks
of
lava
this
chasm
descended
abruptly
to
a
depth
of
over
five
hundred
feet
and
then
as
abruptly
ascended
to
the
level
of
the
distant
end
of
the
trail
where
it
brought
one
to
the
ridge
that
bear
forks
valley
do
you
want
to
go
through
the
devil
causeway
asked
polly
oh
by
all
means
exclaimed
anne
i
wish
we
had
thought
of
bringing
the
camera
said
barbara
we
will
some
other
day
now
let
us
see
the
best
views
to
get
quickly
replied
anne
glad
to
hear
barbara
express
herself
favorably
you
people
go
down
into
that
yawning
grave
while
i
sit
here
and
plot
out
a
preface
for
anne
book
said
exhausted
eleanor
selecting
a
bowlder
where
she
could
sit
and
see
far
and
wide
i
just
as
soon
stay
with
eleanor
while
you
two
go
down
and
back
again
ventured
polly
all
right
bob
and
i
will
see
what
to
be
seen
and
be
back
shortly
agreed
anne
starting
down
the
trail
the
two
young
girls
sat
high
upon
the
lava
bowlder
while
polly
pointed
out
different
familiar
spots
and
mountain
peaks
then
eleanor
turned
and
looked
curiously
at
her
companion
does
your
father
own
all
of
this
great
estate
free
and
clear
asked
she
free
and
clear
what
do
you
mean
that
he
cleared
it
of
timber
and
freed
it
of
eleanor
laughed
heartily
mercy
no
i
never
thought
of
that
i
meant
a
mortgage
you
know
i
do
know
what
a
mortgage
is
but
father
never
had
to
clear
the
place
much
as
it
was
always
rich
free
soil
without
brush
eleanor
glanced
quizzically
at
polly
humph
my
father
knows
what
a
mortgage
is
poor
man
mother
made
him
do
it
to
get
her
a
french
car
this
spring
if
your
father
was
my
father
and
owned
all
this
vast
place
free
and
clear
my
mother
would
mortgage
it
in
a
jiffy
if
she
married
him
well
she
did
came
decidedly
from
polly
with
a
grateful
sigh
of
relief
eleanor
laughed
in
appreciation
say
polly
my
father
would
like
you
down
to
the
ground
polly
made
no
reply
and
eleanor
looked
about
her
again
polly
how
does
it
feel
to
own
such
wonderful
things
as
you
just
showed
us
and
such
a
great
farm
as
you
have
i
never
thought
of
it
in
fact
i
do
believe
any
of
us
remember
who
owns
them
everybody
is
welcome
to
help
themselves
to
these
cliffs
and
the
jewels
at
rainbow
cliffs
how
much
do
you
your
father
is
worth
now
asked
eleanor
showing
a
trace
of
maynard
teachings
i
never
asked
him
we
never
thought
of
his
being
worth
more
than
we
might
need
oh
but
you
never
can
need
all
those
cattle
and
the
vast
farm
or
the
wheat
and
other
products
he
ships
and
they
bring
in
money
persisted
the
daughter
of
a
banker
he
sends
it
off
we
ca
let
it
spoil
you
know
replied
the
thrifty
rancher
daughter
but
i
do
know
how
much
money
he
may
be
worth
maybe
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
for
the
land
and
maybe
another
hundred
thousand
in
cattle
i
heard
john
and
father
talk
over
an
offer
of
half
a
million
dollars
for
part
interest
in
the
rainbow
cliffs
but
dad
would
spoil
what
what
did
you
say
he
refused
shrilled
eleanor
polly
turned
suddenly
to
look
at
her
companion
she
was
surprised
at
the
expression
on
eleanor
face
i
never
lie
why
should
i
she
cried
in
defense
no
but
you
must
have
been
joking
i
was
why
should
i
joke
retorted
polly
but
goodness
me
girl
if
your
father
was
as
rich
as
all
that
why
would
you
care
about
wasting
a
doughnut
and
look
at
your
mother
making
her
own
butter
and
helping
in
housework
anne
says
she
even
spins
her
own
linen
towels
and
knits
your
stockings
what
under
the
sun
would
she
work
like
that
for
if
she
could
afford
to
live
we
do
cried
eleanor
incredulously
my
mother
does
to
do
a
thing
unless
she
wants
to
she
just
likes
to
do
it
for
us
and
it
sure
does
make
a
home
declared
polly
fondly
as
she
looked
across
the
pit
to
her
home
i
guess
it
does
but
then
some
mothers
ca
sew
and
spin
and
cook
you
see
so
where
would
the
home
be
if
we
did
have
servants
and
folks
to
do
for
us
sighed
eleanor
comparing
her
own
home
life
to
polly
to
the
latter
advantage
what
does
your
mother
do
nolla
asked
polly
sympathetically
oh
she
is
a
society
leader
you
know
she
goes
calling
and
has
bridge
parties
every
week
then
she
has
her
teas
and
dinners
and
the
balls
or
theater
parties
in
season
other
times
she
has
her
clubs
and
welfare
work
she
is
president
of
a
charity
work
you
see
and
has
to
address
her
members
every
once
in
a
while
said
eleanor
warming
up
to
her
description
as
she
visualized
her
mother
important
anne
told
us
about
how
sick
you
were
two
years
ago
and
how
you
had
to
leave
home
to
live
in
denver
all
last
winter
said
polly
a
compassionate
note
creeping
into
her
voice
as
she
pitied
the
girl
at
her
side
well
i
got
better
did
i
came
from
eleanor
shortly
then
she
said
tenderly
anne
and
her
mother
were
great
yes
but
i
was
thinking
if
it
was
me
so
sick
that
the
doctors
feared
i
would
never
be
well
again
do
you
mother
would
have
stayed
at
home
when
i
was
with
strangers
in
denver
i
not
all
the
butter
or
balls
or
charities
in
the
world
could
not
have
kept
her
from
my
side
every
minute
i
was
sick
such
emphasis
found
eleanor
lacking
with
a
reply
but
her
eyes
filled
up
at
the
thought
of
a
love
that
would
sacrifice
the
world
for
a
beloved
child
would
her
mother
do
that
if
she
realized
any
danger
to
her
children
ah
that
is
what
hurt
polly
my
father
would
do
as
much
for
me
too
said
eleanor
exultantly
the
moment
she
remembered
one
parent
who
loved
her
unreservedly
so
would
mine
then
why
should
he
object
to
your
having
a
good
education
in
denver
and
look
at
the
way
he
dresses
you
polly
i
do
want
you
to
think
i
am
poking
fun
at
you
i
not
but
the
way
you
slick
back
your
hair
into
two
long
braids
and
the
baggy
skirts
you
wear
are
simply
outlandish
if
i
had
that
wonderful
curly
chestnut
hair
i
make
so
much
of
it
that
i
look
positively
beautiful
polly
felt
hurt
not
only
because
of
her
love
of
the
beautiful
in
everything
but
also
because
she
hoped
eleanor
would
turn
out
to
be
a
staunch
friend
now
of
course
she
would
make
friends
with
such
an
country
girl
it
much
easier
to
keep
the
hair
out
of
my
face
when
it
slicked
back
besides
there
is
any
in
oak
creek
my
mother
but
she
does
have
much
time
to
trim
dresses
when
i
go
to
denver
i
have
as
fine
a
wardrobe
as
yours
if
your
father
has
any
money
why
does
he
buy
an
automobile
instead
of
using
that
awful
and
why
does
he
hire
servants
to
do
the
work
your
mother
now
does
she
could
sew
on
your
clothes
if
she
had
more
time
mother
never
liked
to
have
me
think
much
of
dress
and
i
have
always
been
so
busy
with
my
pets
and
trips
on
the
mountains
that
i
generally
lived
in
my
riding
clothes
during
vacations
but
my
shoes
are
as
good
as
yours
you
said
so
and
my
teeth
and
hands
and
feet
are
as
carefully
taken
care
of
as
yours
or
any
one
eleanor
admitted
that
this
was
so
but
polly
still
had
to
prove
that
her
father
had
money
and
she
insisted
upon
the
fact
being
proven
if
you
do
believe
me
you
can
write
to
my
brother
john
declared
polly
his
best
college
friend
visited
here
last
and
simply
went
crazy
over
rainbow
cliffs
he
went
so
far
as
to
have
an
expert
mineralogist
come
over
here
to
examine
the
stones
this
man
was
out
west
on
business
for
tom
latimer
father
and
tom
said
it
would
cost
next
to
nothing
to
send
for
him
the
man
said
the
jewels
would
create
the
greatest
speculations
in
new
york
if
they
were
placed
on
the
market
those
were
his
very
words
tom
latimer
do
you
know
him
gasped
eleanor
he
john
chum
he
visited
here
for
several
weeks
and
we
had
the
loveliest
times
i
liked
him
a
lot
i
should
think
you
would
but
polly
tom
is
several
years
older
than
you
in
fact
he
is
older
than
bob
as
she
found
out
when
she
tried
to
capture
him
for
herself
his
father
is
one
of
the
richest
financiers
in
new
york
i
did
think
of
his
age
although
now
you
speak
of
it
i
suppose
he
must
be
about
john
age
but
he
acted
like
a
big
boy
so
we
had
fine
times
explained
polly
entirely
innocent
of
eleanor
hints
regarding
the
young
man
eleanor
threw
back
her
head
and
laughed
heartily
just
wait
until
i
tell
bob
this
oh
how
she
will
envy
you
your
chance
why
she
did
everything
on
earth
but
fling
herself
at
his
head
when
mother
told
her
he
was
the
richest
catch
of
the
season
why
he
told
me
he
was
never
going
to
marry
until
he
found
another
girl
like
anne
stewart
he
thinks
is
splendid
i
asked
him
why
he
did
marry
her
and
he
teased
me
by
saying
i
wanted
to
know
too
much
but
he
did
tell
me
that
anne
loved
some
one
else
who
was
a
thousand
times
better
than
he
so
he
had
no
chance
with
her
eleanor
glanced
sharply
at
polly
to
see
whether
she
was
innocent
of
guile
or
whether
she
was
trying
to
hide
her
real
meaning
she
saw
that
her
young
companion
had
really
no
thought
of
love
for
herself
or
for
her
brother
john
so
eleanor
never
hinted
that
she
had
a
suspicion
of
the
truth
about
anne
and
john
do
you
think
anne
liked
tom
latimer
she
asked
oh
yes
but
she
likes
him
because
he
is
such
a
friend
of
my
and
her
brother
you
see
anne
brother
paul
is
at
college
with
john
and
tom
replied
polly
yes
i
know
my
brother
is
one
of
their
too
but
i
never
met
your
brother
or
paul
mother
said
i
was
too
young
to
appear
in
the
when
pete
gave
his
party
to
his
this
spring
oh
i
heard
about
a
who
is
so
clever
in
his
engineering
class
is
that
your
brother
eagerly
asked
polly
yes
and
we
proud
of
him
at
least
dad
and
i
are
i
do
suppose
mother
will
feel
proud
of
him
until
he
marries
a
rich
society
girl
and
bob
never
bothers
about
what
he
does
now
all
this
was
new
and
strange
gossip
to
polly
and
she
was
willing
to
hear
more
along
the
same
lines
but
anne
and
barbara
returned
from
the
ravine
and
the
former
called
to
them
have
you
been
wondering
what
kept
us
so
long
girls
never
thought
of
you
we
been
getting
acquainted
replied
eleanor
with
a
smile
at
polly
that
good
now
let
go
and
visit
rainbow
cliffs
added
anne
lead
off
polly
and
i
will
follow
said
eleanor
linking
her
arm
through
polly
polly
was
not
only
surprised
but
pleased
at
eleanor
evident
act
of
friendship
she
had
never
had
a
of
her
own
age
to
confide
in
and
she
had
felt
very
diffident
with
these
city
girls
after
their
arrival
but
the
short
talk
while
sitting
on
the
bowlder
not
only
established
a
firmer
foundation
for
good
comradeship
between
the
two
girls
but
it
gave
each
a
better
appreciation
of
the
other
character
after
a
circuitous
walk
the
four
girls
reached
the
cliffs
where
the
jeweled
stones
shone
resplendent
from
the
and
ground
where
tons
of
them
were
piled
up
in
abandoned
confusion
no
wonder
they
are
named
rainbow
cliffs
i
never
saw
such
a
dazzling
sight
as
these
green
blue
red
and
other
colored
stones
cried
anne
they
are
so
beautiful
that
it
seems
as
if
they
are
real
jewels
sighed
barbara
gazing
raptly
at
the
seemingly
precious
stones
polly
says
a
man
offered
a
fabulous
price
for
a
small
interest
in
this
spot
remarked
eleanor
taking
up
a
handful
of
the
pebbles
and
letting
them
run
between
her
fingers
in
a
speculative
manner
while
she
glanced
covertly
at
her
sister
not
really
exclaimed
barbara
looking
at
polly
yes
but
please
let
not
talk
of
it
father
does
not
like
any
of
us
to
speak
of
it
as
he
fears
john
and
i
will
have
our
heads
turned
returned
polly
sending
a
reproachful
look
at
eleanor
but
eleanor
smiled
with
satisfaction
for
she
knew
she
had
boosted
polly
value
a
thousand
fold
in
barbara
estimation
well
i
sell
out
if
it
was
me
my
but
the
good
times
i
could
have
on
the
money
this
would
bring
sighed
barbara
glancing
up
at
the
masses
of
colored
stones
towering
above
her
in
the
sunshine
my
brother
john
says
he
is
going
to
work
these
cliffs
as
soon
as
he
finishes
his
college
course
of
engineering
said
polly
and
tom
latimer
is
going
to
be
his
partner
added
eleanor
watching
her
sister
closely
nolla
i
did
tell
you
that
at
all
cried
polly
tom
latimer
does
know
him
asked
barbara
of
anne
i
do
know
bob
paul
and
he
are
great
friends
of
john
brewster
you
know
polly
would
not
deign
to
look
at
eleanor
again
and
took
the
homeward
trail
without
another
word
as
she
felt
pained
at
her
newly
found
friend
of
facts
but
eleanor
had
done
it
all
for
friendship
sake
she
knew
what
a
radical
change
all
this
information
would
make
in
barbara
estimation
of
the
brewsters
and
the
ranch
so
she
said
more
than
she
herself
really
believed
true
at
that
moment
the
sounded
and
the
girls
started
for
the
house
without
making
further
comment
on
the
cliffs
chapter
ix
several
misunderstandings
as
the
four
girls
came
around
the
corner
of
the
sary
banged
a
plate
of
hot
biscuits
upon
the
table
some
of
the
biscuits
bounced
off
and
rolled
across
the
snowy
cloth
so
sary
made
a
swift
lunge
to
catch
them
before
they
fell
upon
the
ground
without
hesitation
she
replaced
the
biscuits
on
the
plate
and
glared
at
the
boarders
as
she
mumbled
to
herself
sech
ah
never
did
see
afore
the
strangers
looked
at
each
other
wondering
what
the
maid
perturbed
manner
portended
but
sary
flounced
back
to
the
kitchen
sending
an
angry
glance
over
her
shoulder
before
she
entered
that
sacred
precinct
she
quickly
returned
with
a
glass
dish
of
pear
preserves
and
another
dish
of
peaches
these
were
so
placed
as
to
flank
the
biscuits
when
sary
spied
an
inquisitive
hornet
about
to
settle
upon
the
preserves
git
out
o
that
shrilled
she
whacking
at
the
insect
with
her
kitchen
towel
the
hornet
resented
the
vicious
slap
and
flew
straight
for
sary
red
head
she
unceremoniously
ducked
and
ran
but
the
insect
buzzed
after
her
with
evil
intent
so
sary
ran
for
her
sanctuary
slamming
the
screen
door
safely
between
herself
and
her
pursuer
the
audience
watching
beside
the
table
laughed
merrily
at
the
rout
at
the
sudden
entrance
of
the
maid
into
the
kitchen
brewster
asked
without
looking
up
did
you
place
the
butter
and
milk
on
the
table
sary
it
are
from
sary
curtly
brewster
looked
up
in
surprise
she
saw
sary
on
the
safe
side
of
the
glaring
at
the
hornet
which
was
crawling
slowly
towards
the
crack
in
the
opening
while
buzzing
threateningly
now
and
then
there
a
hornet
sary
better
drive
it
away
before
you
venture
out
again
ah
are
take
the
kettle
and
dash
some
boiling
water
on
it
it
sounds
angry
enough
to
sting
it
am
flared
sary
as
if
her
anger
too
was
vicious
enough
to
do
as
the
hornet
would
but
she
turned
to
get
the
hot
water
and
when
she
returned
to
deluge
the
plague
lo
it
was
there
no
more
sary
what
wrong
with
you
since
this
morning
you
not
been
civil
in
any
way
said
brewster
impatiently
wrong
jeb
an
havin
t
eat
meals
all
alone
in
a
big
kitchen
that
fine
fer
any
one
but
these
fool
gals
is
so
high
an
mighty
they
hez
t
nibble
at
a
table
under
the
trees
sary
lofty
scorn
was
only
equaled
by
her
majestic
pose
as
she
delivered
her
sentence
you
wrong
sary
we
do
nibble
at
the
table
we
leave
that
for
the
corrected
brewster
sweetly
sary
vented
an
explosive
humph
and
grabbed
the
as
she
left
the
kitchen
she
sent
an
insulted
glance
at
her
mistress
but
the
recent
correction
in
speech
made
her
forget
the
hornet
the
watchful
insect
had
been
sitting
directly
over
the
door
and
now
eagerly
resumed
its
drive
on
the
enemy
despite
her
resolve
to
be
dignified
and
scornful
sary
had
to
take
flight
before
the
group
seated
about
the
table
the
girls
laughed
one
of
the
maid
loose
shoes
flew
off
during
the
race
around
the
table
and
the
hornet
would
have
conquered
her
had
not
brewster
risen
to
the
occasion
and
downed
the
insect
with
his
newspaper
his
heavy
boot
finished
the
career
of
the
and
sary
went
back
to
the
house
picking
up
her
shoe
as
she
passed
its
resting
place
once
more
in
the
kitchen
she
returned
to
the
argument
ef
it
that
hed
this
an
would
be
worn
out
in
no
time
alone
ah
pack
an
git
this
day
but
in
her
heart
the
widow
knew
horses
could
not
drag
her
from
such
luxury
as
she
had
only
recently
enjoyed
besides
there
was
jeb
he
offered
future
possibilities
of
curtailing
her
widowhood
while
sary
delivered
her
opinion
brewster
finished
creaming
the
potatoes
and
now
dished
them
up
as
she
started
for
the
she
turned
to
the
maid
and
said
either
you
have
a
severe
attack
of
indigestion
coming
on
sary
or
you
are
falling
in
love
again
both
diseases
present
similar
symptoms
in
their
first
stages
brewster
but
the
mistress
refused
to
look
back
even
though
the
temptation
to
see
sary
face
was
great
oh
mis
brewster
how
kin
say
that
so
soon
after
funeral
an
the
expenses
not
all
paid
yit
howled
sary
rushing
to
the
door
that
her
mistress
might
hear
her
lament
but
the
call
fell
upon
deaf
ears
miss
brewster
deigned
no
reply
so
sary
sat
down
heavily
upon
a
strong
kitchen
chair
and
took
thought
for
herself
how
did
miss
brewster
guess
her
idea
had
she
discovered
in
some
uncanny
manner
that
sary
had
slyly
removed
photograph
from
her
bible
and
cremated
it
that
she
might
feel
freer
to
accept
a
second
proposal
of
marriage
if
it
came
she
coulden
hev
foun
out
cuz
ah
locked
th
box
sence
then
she
mus
be
one
of
them
by
nature
ah
rickon
an
she
jes
reads
me
like
a
book
never
dreaming
of
the
turbulence
created
in
sary
mind
by
her
casual
remark
about
dyspepsia
and
love
brewster
took
her
chair
at
the
table
immediately
after
giving
thanks
the
host
stood
up
to
carve
the
roast
then
to
the
surprise
of
all
present
it
was
seen
that
the
rancher
had
donned
his
black
coat
and
had
taken
the
trouble
to
wear
cuffs
and
a
starched
collar
trying
to
avoid
polly
eyes
brewster
met
the
gaze
of
anne
but
the
two
understood
and
exchanged
a
fleeting
glance
of
satisfaction
and
approval
well
girls
did
you
visit
rainbow
cliffs
and
how
did
you
like
them
asked
brewster
having
finished
the
carving
oh
they
are
just
wonderful
declared
eleanor
i
hear
they
are
very
valuable
remarked
barbara
brewster
sent
her
a
sharp
glance
and
then
frowned
at
polly
ah
never
give
that
a
thought
there
they
stood
for
ages
before
sam
brewster
saw
them
and
ah
reckon
there
they
stand
for
ages
after
sam
brewster
is
dead
and
forgotten
not
if
i
can
coax
polly
to
sell
enough
of
the
loose
stones
to
buy
an
automobile
and
go
off
to
school
said
eleanor
emphatically
an
annoyed
look
from
brewster
and
a
surprised
one
from
brewster
made
anne
and
polly
feel
uncomfortable
at
eleanor
lack
of
tact
but
the
hostess
was
equal
to
the
situation
polly
who
do
you
think
came
to
the
kitchen
door
to
ask
for
you
while
you
were
at
the
cliffs
this
morning
here
to
ask
for
me
mah
mother
exclaimed
polly
in
surprise
yes
and
she
felt
deeply
offended
because
you
had
not
asked
for
her
health
or
even
sent
word
to
her
by
jeb
and
she
so
lonely
after
her
accident
too
brewster
managed
to
express
great
pathos
with
her
words
oh
my
darling
noddy
mother
did
she
come
to
the
door
laughed
polly
sympathetic
tears
starting
in
her
eyes
at
the
picture
called
up
by
her
mother
yes
and
she
said
it
was
simply
inexcusable
in
you
she
was
willing
to
carry
you
anywhere
you
wished
to
go
but
now
she
will
disown
you
forever
unless
you
make
peace
with
her
this
afternoon
said
brewster
smiling
as
she
saw
how
she
had
succeeded
in
her
effort
to
change
the
thoughts
and
conversation
of
her
family
and
jeb
said
he
had
the
horses
ready
for
you
girls
as
soon
as
you
wanted
to
try
them
out
added
brewster
dinner
was
dispatched
hastily
after
this
announcement
and
the
girls
ran
to
don
their
habits
all
idea
of
barbara
wiring
for
money
that
day
was
forgotten
as
they
went
gayly
towards
the
corral
to
try
out
different
horses
the
entire
afternoon
was
given
over
to
exciting
sport
as
the
girls
and
even
brewster
tried
to
outride
each
other
about
the
great
enclosure
polly
made
noddy
happy
by
mounting
her
silky
little
back
and
whispering
fond
nothings
in
the
long
ears
anne
was
pleased
to
find
her
chicago
friends
could
ride
so
well
on
the
restive
western
horses
and
both
chicago
girls
were
surprised
to
find
what
a
magnificent
rider
brewster
was
she
was
slowly
rising
in
their
private
opinions
of
her
during
the
following
days
the
girls
took
short
rides
to
points
of
interest
in
bear
forks
valley
and
nearby
mountains
and
then
came
sunday
barbara
had
not
openly
declared
her
satisfaction
with
the
ranch
or
time
spent
with
its
people
the
past
week
but
neither
had
any
one
heard
a
hint
of
her
returning
to
chicago
in
fact
so
much
had
been
crowded
in
the
days
just
gone
by
that
no
moment
had
been
found
in
which
to
of
returning
home
the
trunks
had
not
been
opened
since
the
habits
had
been
removed
as
there
was
no
need
for
changes
of
costumes
and
the
traveling
bags
had
contained
all
the
girls
needed
for
a
few
days
the
ranchers
of
the
rocky
mountains
are
so
strict
about
observing
the
sabbath
day
that
everything
pleasurable
or
in
the
form
of
work
has
to
end
at
twelve
saturday
night
every
one
goes
to
meetin
on
sundays
some
driving
a
distance
of
twenty
miles
or
more
once
a
month
an
ordained
preacher
crosses
the
flat
top
mountains
to
hold
a
regular
service
and
on
other
sundays
the
leading
ranchers
read
the
bible
and
conduct
prayers
the
weather
throughout
summer
in
this
section
of
colorado
is
generally
fine
and
clear
should
a
heavy
thunder
storm
arise
it
as
quickly
passes
over
again
the
nights
are
cool
and
dewy
and
the
days
glorious
and
exhilarating
hence
one
has
no
dread
of
foggy
or
prolonged
rainy
days
as
in
the
east
the
plan
of
dining
under
the
trees
had
proved
a
good
one
and
as
the
weather
remained
fair
no
meals
had
to
be
eaten
in
the
kitchen
since
that
first
day
when
the
family
gathered
about
the
table
that
sunday
morning
they
all
seemed
cheerful
and
animated
but
brewster
had
not
yet
made
his
appearance
has
brewster
had
breakfast
so
soon
asked
anne
no
he
has
not
come
out
yet
he
is
reading
the
sunday
lesson
for
his
class
in
school
replied
brewster
sunday
school
do
you
go
where
is
the
church
asked
eleanor
wonderingly
down
at
bear
forks
we
use
it
for
church
as
well
as
for
other
important
purposes
besides
brewster
replied
smilingly
soon
after
the
girls
appeared
at
table
brewster
came
out
he
said
good
morning
in
a
very
sedate
manner
that
surprised
the
girls
who
were
not
accustomed
to
his
sunday
manners
that
morning
he
gave
a
lengthy
prayer
of
thanks
that
was
meant
to
cover
the
past
week
but
once
he
had
concluded
grace
he
turned
to
his
wife
mary
i
sure
i
smelled
the
omelette
scorching
brewster
hurried
to
the
kitchen
where
she
found
the
eggs
burning
and
the
room
filled
with
horrid
smoke
sary
was
scolding
at
a
great
rate
but
she
never
used
a
word
because
it
was
wicked
why
sary
how
did
you
happen
to
let
the
eggs
burn
how
come
well
i
tell
brewster
handed
me
a
printed
prayer
to
learn
and
i
was
looking
for
my
specs
in
my
box
when
it
happened
that
all
the
good
that
prayer
did
me
brewster
kept
a
straight
face
and
said
well
never
mind
sary
we
soon
have
another
omelette
ready
not
on
sunday
i
made
one
and
that
was
a
sin
ez
you
kin
see
by
the
way
it
burnt
i
does
no
more
cookin
or
there
be
extra
sin
to
wipe
out
thar
bread
and
jam
and
coffee
enough
fer
any
one
to
git
along
on
fer
a
few
hours
brewster
knew
her
husband
however
so
she
said
nothing
to
sary
but
hurriedly
whipped
up
another
omelette
and
fried
it
to
a
delicate
brown
this
she
carried
out
to
serve
at
the
kitchen
door
she
turned
to
speak
to
the
help
sary
bring
out
the
bread
and
jam
will
you
sary
had
filled
a
deep
dish
with
dry
cereal
and
held
it
in
one
hand
she
took
up
the
with
the
other
and
ran
to
get
out
of
the
which
had
been
flung
open
by
her
mistress
but
the
door
slammed
to
sooner
than
sary
had
calculated
and
struck
the
in
its
violent
closing
throwing
it
upon
the
floor
consarn
th
pesky
door
now
thar
hai
nuthin
on
arth
fer
brewster
to
give
thanks
fer
but
jes
toast
and
jam
ah
cai
bile
another
pot
of
coffee
on
sunday
sary
stood
contemplating
the
disaster
until
brewster
called
out
sary
will
you
bring
that
bread
and
jam
the
help
brought
the
desired
edibles
and
explained
about
the
coffee
eleanor
laughed
out
loud
but
anne
kicked
her
warningly
under
the
table
brewster
turned
to
explain
to
his
guests
ranchers
never
work
on
the
sabbath
the
less
we
cook
the
better
it
is
for
we
do
penance
to
our
material
desire
for
food
i
have
never
been
so
severe
as
to
forbid
cooked
food
on
my
table
but
many
of
the
families
do
this
morning
however
we
are
compelled
to
sacrifice
our
weaknesses
to
sary
ways
so
the
bread
and
jam
was
eaten
with
the
omelette
to
the
accompaniment
of
cold
water
and
then
the
master
prepared
to
leave
the
table
girls
do
waste
much
time
fussing
with
your
toilette
we
are
behind
time
as
it
is
did
you
expect
us
to
go
to
church
gasped
barbara
certainly
everybody
goes
returned
brewster
equally
surprised
at
such
a
question
why
we
have
unpacked
any
clothes
for
church
that
does
matter
the
lord
does
judge
according
to
dress
if
your
heart
is
clean
it
is
all
he
wants
replied
brewster
walking
away
towards
the
house
the
girls
looked
at
each
other
in
amazement
what
shall
we
do
anne
i
wo
go
in
this
old
rag
declared
barbara
do
drag
me
into
the
argument
bob
you
hate
going
to
church
and
there
no
use
trying
to
pretend
it
is
your
dress
that
keeps
you
away
would
eleanor
care
to
go
with
us
asked
brewster
is
polly
going
countered
eleanor
oh
yes
i
always
go
said
polly
i
do
know
poll
i
go
next
sunday
but
i
am
taken
by
surprise
this
week
i
stay
home
with
bob
i
guess
very
well
then
i
tell
brewster
to
omit
the
extra
seat
in
the
wagon
and
brewster
hurried
away
to
dress
what
shall
we
do
all
morning
asked
eleanor
the
moment
the
was
out
of
sight
we
might
unpack
a
few
things
we
need
and
arrange
the
trunks
so
mine
can
be
sent
back
home
without
giving
you
any
trouble
about
yours
suggested
barbara
that
a
good
plan
and
a
good
day
to
do
it
in
too
laughed
eleanor
i
think
it
is
ridiculous
the
way
they
go
on
about
the
sabbath
i
suppose
they
would
be
dreadfully
shocked
if
they
knew
we
were
about
to
unpack
our
trunks
said
barbara
sneeringly
time
passed
quickly
in
sorting
out
the
numerous
items
in
the
seven
trunks
and
the
girls
felt
famished
before
they
were
done
the
articles
they
wished
to
have
out
for
use
were
piled
up
on
the
grass
outside
the
barn
and
it
looked
a
formidable
heap
when
all
was
ready
to
leave
the
barn
goodness
me
we
have
to
make
a
dozen
trips
to
the
house
with
all
this
exclaimed
eleanor
we
carry
all
we
can
pile
up
this
first
trip
and
then
have
luncheon
afterward
we
will
carry
the
rest
over
said
barbara
the
clothing
seemed
so
light
that
they
kept
piling
up
the
articles
until
they
could
hardly
see
from
under
the
mountain
of
lingerie
and
accessories
but
they
both
found
how
heavy
the
light
summer
clothes
could
be
when
one
arms
were
extended
unnaturally
to
hold
up
so
much
finery
they
finally
reached
the
porch
and
threw
the
things
into
rustic
chairs
while
they
sat
down
to
cool
off
in
the
breeze
now
you
carry
the
clothes
to
the
bedroom
bob
while
i
hunt
in
the
kitchen
for
something
to
eat
remarked
eleanor
after
a
time
these
important
duties
attended
to
the
girls
were
about
to
go
to
the
barn
for
a
second
load
of
clothing
when
the
drove
up
to
the
steps
the
family
got
out
and
jeb
drove
on
to
the
barn
what
this
on
the
grass
asked
brewster
stooping
to
pick
up
a
silk
stocking
that
barbara
i
think
said
anne
instantly
divining
the
cause
of
its
being
there
then
jeb
came
running
back
to
the
house
with
news
ah
found
th
trunks
is
opened
by
some
one
an
all
th
finery
is
piled
on
the
grass
outside
th
barn
what
hes
happened
ah
want
to
know
luckily
brewster
heard
his
remark
and
brewster
had
no
time
to
speak
before
she
caught
anne
hand
and
led
jeb
back
to
the
barn
shortly
thereafter
the
three
returned
laden
with
everything
ever
known
in
a
lady
wardrobe
mary
you
have
broken
the
commandments
said
brewster
overcoming
a
keen
desire
to
laugh
at
his
wife
maybe
sam
but
i
strengthened
another
called
the
rule
i
certainly
did
unto
them
what
i
want
some
one
to
do
for
mine
in
case
of
need
poor
girls
sary
happened
to
be
coming
from
the
kitchen
with
the
early
supper
dishes
in
her
hands
she
saw
jeb
with
dainty
silk
lingerie
almost
covering
his
head
and
she
heard
and
brewster
words
it
was
too
much
she
continued
on
her
way
but
once
she
reached
the
table
she
thumped
the
dishes
down
to
vent
her
spite
to
think
them
city
gals
kin
wind
jeb
about
their
fingers
like
that
on
a
sunday
too
ah
wonder
he
got
no
respeck
fer
me
an
the
brewster
women
that
he
allows
them
snippy
misses
to
git
him
to
carry
underwear
him
what
an
unmarried
man
at
that
while
the
family
sat
at
table
enjoying
the
quiet
sunday
evening
sary
took
advantage
of
their
interesting
discourse
to
slip
away
from
the
kitchen
and
examine
the
beautiful
apparel
spread
out
upon
the
great
bed
in
the
laws
me
ef
it
hai
like
a
bridal
outfit
ef
ah

not
have
hed
a
poor
rancher
like
bill
ah
could
have
hed
my
pick
of
the
men
at
oak
crick
sary
sighed
with
pity
at
her
own
limitations
in
life
and
she
crept
back
to
her
kitchen
planning
how
she
could
manage
to
get
one
of
the
girls
to
present
her
with
some
of
the
bridal
finery
thus
pondering
the
problem
she
sat
down
opposite
jeb
and
entertained
him
as
he
ate
his
sunday
supper
of
pork
and
beans
chapter
x
the
dance
at
bear
forks
the
interesting
events
which
crowded
each
other
day
after
day
in
this
western
life
so
engrossed
the
girls
that
bob
forgot
her
vow
to
send
a
telegram
for
return
money
to
chicago
she
even
forgot
to
write
to
maynard
at
newport
or
to
any
of
her
society
friends
until
anne
reminded
her
of
a
duty
to
her
parents
tuesday
following

at

pit
a
rancher
wife
called

brewster
shaking
her
head
rebukingly
at
the
small
boy
who
stood
on
the
rockers
of
his
mother
chair
and
gripped

explained
brewster
looking
regretfully
at
the
where
the
two
willful
children
were
destroying
the
fruits
of
her
planting
halsey

her

instantly

from

kitchen
to
assist
in
entertaining
the
morning
visitor
the
two
bad
youngsters
left
to
their
own
devices
began
throwing
the
whitewashed
stones
that
encircled

how

the
visitor
frankness
lost
none
of
its
curiosity
as
she
eagerly
waited
to
hear
all
about
the
brewster
family
with
the
mistress
still
present
but
ignored
sary
was
in
her
glory
and
made
the
most
of
it
she
had
just
reached
the
point
where
she
intended
asking
the
gossip
to
stop
to
have
dinner
when
a
crash
interrupted
the
enlivening
yellow
jacket
pass
conversation
sary
run
and
see
what
those
children

cried
brewster
mentally
thanking
her
stars
for
the
timely
intervention
soon
the
ladies
heard
jim
henderson
halsey
bawling
loudly
and
his
sister
backing
away
from
the
buttery
while
she
continued
making
faces
at
the
angry
help
the
little
girl
protruded
tongue
made
sary
rush
at
her
with
uplifted
palm
but
both
youngsters
were
so
accustomed
to
dodging
these
attacks
that
they
reached
the
haven
of
presence
without
a
painful
encounter
the
ol
thing
shook
me
till
my
teeth
rattled
wailed
jim
henderson

hope
of
dinner
still
lingering
but
growing
dim
as
sary
did
not
return
fortunately
for
the
general
peace
of
all
concerned
brewster
drove
up
to
the
porch
on
his
way
to
oak
creek
his
wife
beseeching
look
appealed
to
him
understandingly

the

the
moment
the
halsey
scions

they
clung
to
their
mother
skirts
and
whined

next
ranch

suggested
brewster
brewster
instantly
acquiesced
and
ran
to
cut
three
generous
triangles
of
cake
while
her
husband
came
up
and
lifted
sally
up
into
the
deep
wagon
before
any
of
the
halsey
family
could
protest
he
had
turned
lifted
jim
henderson
up
beside
his
sister
and
then
asked
the
visitor
if
he
could
help
her
up
to
the
seat
the
cake
was
distributed
and
the
vexed
but
vanquished
morning
caller
jabbed
a
through
her
rusty
toque
and
pulled
her
shoulder
cape
tightly
over
her
back
before
bowing
haughtily
to
brewster
not
until
the
turned
the
edge
of
rainbow
cliffs
did
brewster
permit
herself
to
leave
the
post
of
watching
and
slump
down
into
the
porch
rocker
with
a
sigh
of
gratitude
half
an
hour
later
the
sound
of
wheels
caused
her
to
spring
up
in
dread
but
her
husband
cheery
laugh
relieved
her
fears
ah
saw
your
difficulty
and
did
the
only
sensible
thing
but
must
keep
this
trick
a
secret
if
sary
gets
hold
of
it
my
reputation
in
bear
forks
or
yellow
jacket
pass
is
gone
confided
sam
brewster
to
his
wife
as
he
glanced
fearfully
about
for
sary
the
horn
for
dinner
sounded
shortly
after
the
master
return
and
at
the
table
the
girls
were
told
of
the
visitor
and
her
invitation
to
the
dance
but
no
word
of
her
form
of
departure
was
mentioned
it
lucky
we
have
remarked
barbara
do
folks
dress
up
at
these
parties
asked
eleanor
i
should
say
we
do
declared
polly
brewster
and
anne
were
talking
in
low
tones
and
did
not
hear
the
question
and
answer
so
they
did
not
explain
what
polly
meant
by
dressing
up
the
days
intervening
between
the
tuesday
and
the
friday
set
down
for
the
hop
passed
quickly
polly
and
her
mother
washed
and
renovated
the
dotted
swiss
dress
made
for
the
and
to
delight
anne
added
a
blue
sash
and
hair
ribbons
anne
had
a
simple
gown
she
proposed
wearing
and
the
city
girls
had
elaborate
dresses
barbara
very
much
in
the
latest
mode
and
eleanor
flounced
and
furbelowed
but
modestly
high
in
the
neck
as
became
a
girl
not
yet
out
sary
had
bewailed
her
fate
the
day
preceding
the
eventful
one
eleanor
pacified
her
by
presenting
her
with
a
collar
to
enliven
her
rusty
black
alpaca
an
early
supper
was
planned
as
the
ride
to
bear
forks
school
would
take
more
than
an
hour
and
every
one
wanted
to
be
there
for
the
grand
march
for
several
hours
before
barbara
locked
herself
in
the
and
began
her
toilette
she
dressed
her
hair
massaged
and
rouged
and
penciled
her
eyebrows
until
she
quite
tired
herself
out
eleanor
and
anne
rapped
again
and
again
for
admission
but
barbara
was
obdurate
about
her
right
of
possession
when
she
finally
opened
the
door
for
her
they
stared
at
her
in
amused
surprise
your
hair
looks
all
sizzly
bob
said
eleanor
oh
bob
remove
some
of
that
carmine
from
your
lips
advised
anne
why
demanded
barbara
too
much
of
it
that
all
giggled
eleanor
but
anne
and
eleanor
had
their
own
toilettes
to
make
and
paid
no
further
attention
to
barbara
she
managed
to
remove
some
of
the
carmine
and
pat
down
her
hair
hot
she
could
not
do
things
as
the
french
maid
generally
did
them
to
add
to
her
beauty
feeling
dissatisfied
with
her
appearance
made
barbara
irritable
but
she
remained
in
the
room
criticizing
everything
the
two
other
girls
did
or
said
then
just
before
the
horn
sounded
for
supper
a
knock
came
at
the
door
come
in
called
anne
buttoning
her
white
suede
boots
onny
me
ah

wanta
ast

party
whar

old
frien

no
er
yo

sary
anxious
tone
expressed
her
eagerness
for
a
favorable
reply
to
her
query
on
widowhood
eleanor
looked
at
anne
to
answer
so
she
took
the
initiative
certainly
sary
come
right
along
and
enjoy
yourself
barbara
was
shocked
the
help
not
going
surely
humph
miss
halsey
ast
me
afore
she
mentioned
snapped
sary
quite
able
to
defend
herself
against
barbara
pride
oh
bob
does
mean
it
that
way
sary
said
eleanor
giving
her
sister
a
backward
kick
for
silence
of
course
not
bob
means
that
your
mourning
might
prevent
your
attending
the
dance
but
seeing
we
are
all
old
friends
from
ranches
round
about
it
will
be
like
meeting
your
family
added
anne
the
pacifist
wall
then
ah
go
sighed
sary
as
if
loath
to
join
a
merry
throng
but
ah
hez
t
have
a
smitch
of
somethin
miss
bob
hez
fer
her
shoulders
cuz
my
neck
gettin
scrawny
now
barbara
had
draped
chiffon
over
her
neck
and
dress
and
at
request
she
turned
angrily
the
very
idea
this
chiffon
is
two
dollars
a
yard
i
got
the
very
thing
you
need
sary
you
can
wear
second
mourning
now
i
suppose
exclaimed
eleanor
sending
a
look
at
her
sister
she
hurried
to
the
closet
and
took
a
long
flat
box
from
the
upper
shelf
as
she
carried
it
over
to
sary
barbara
stared
eleanor
maynard
are
you
giving
her
something
i
never
will
need
this
summer
and
sary
can
use
it
very
nicely
to
furbish
up
that
black
dress
sary
was
too
excited
to
wait
and
open
the
box
in
her
own
room
so
she
tore
off
the
paper
at
once
a
lovely
chiffon
scarf
lay
revealed
the
predominating
colors
being
violet
ah
clean
locoed
miss
nolla
not
a
soul
ever
know
that
rusty
black
alpacky
is
th
same
dress
miss
pearson
mourned
her
husband
in
fer
five
years
before
ah
got
it
given
me
what
nonsense
as
if
that
dainty
scarf
will
hide
your
outlandish
dress
and
mountainous
figure
came
insultingly
from
barbara
but
nothing
could
spoil
the
joy
of
possessing
such
a
heavenly
wisp
of
angel
robe
as
that
scarf
seemed
to
be
to
sary
she
was
deaf
to
all
else
as
she
tenderly
hugged
the
box
to
her
ample
bosom
and
backed
from
the
room
when
all
were
seated
about
the
table
which
was
spread
in
the
living
room
for
that
night
brewster
smiled
at
polly
in
her
gala
attire
anne
looked
sweet
and
lovely
in
her
simple
dress
but
the
host
could
not
quite
make
out
the
style
the
city
girls
wore
he
was
not
accustomed
to
boudoir
gowns
of
filmy
lace
and
thin
silk
and
he
thought
they
were
a
new
style
of
party
dress
had
he
known
barbara
proposed
wearing
he
would
have
asked
her
to
remain
at
home
as
sary
passed
the
bread
to
eleanor
she
leaned
over
and
beamed
miss
nolla
ah
tried
that
on
an
woulden
know
me
ah
shore
pick
me
fer
a
lanciers
mebbe
that
scarf
give
him
spine
enough
to
speak
sary
i
know
right
well
he
will
declared
eleanor
not
dreaming
the
mischief
she
wrought
in
sary
soul
at
that
sary
pranced
back
to
the
kitchen
but
her
flighty
thoughts
were
swinging
corners
in
the
quadrille
with
jeb
and
the
fried
potatoes
were
gracefully
shot
into
the
as
the
pan
was
waved
aloft
in
imitation
of
dancers
she
had
envied
in
days
gone
by
sary
hurry
with
the
please
called
polly
and
sary
grabbed
up
the
stone
jug
of
vinegar
from
the
back
of
the
stove
where
she
had
placed
it
and
ran
in
to
pour
the
beverage
into
cups
the
combined
cries
of
every
one
at
the
table
failed
to
bring
her
to
her
senses
so
brewster
told
her
to
go
quickly
and
dress
for
the
dance
then
wagon
wheels
sounded
on
the
gravel
road
and
jeb
yelled
air
ready
sary
gave
a
last
lingering
look
in
the
tiny
mirror
over
her
combination
and
realized
what
charms
she
had
when
rainbow
chiffon
adorned
her
person
she
then
snuffed
out
the
tiny
and
hurried
forth
to
meet
her
fate
jeb
was
dressed
regardless
of
all
censorship
a
great
flaming
peony
in
his
reflected
its
scarlet
on
his
ruddy
face
his
tie
was
a
riot
of
colors
and
detracted
somewhat
from
his
purple
socks
and
tan
shoes
he
wore
a
figured
vest
won
at
an
oak
creek
raffle
and
large
checked
trousers
said
to
be
the
latest
fashion
some
years
back
when
he
squandered
his
money
on
them
with
his
face
scoured
until
it
shone
and
his
hair
greased
so
that
it
was
plastered
down
neatly
jeb
felt
he
could
woo
and
win
the
prettiest
gal
in
the
he
forgot
there
was
a
female
widow
about
the
brewster
party
reached
the
later
than
was
their
wont
and
the
was
with
ranchers
wives
and
daughters
all
waiting
to
pass
judgment
on
the
strangers
from
pebbly
pit
brewster
and
polly
entered
first
shaking
hands
with
friends
and
acquaintances
anne
followed
smiling
benignly
on
all
barbara
came
next
casting
disdainful
looks
at
the
ordinary
women
she
found
present
eleanor
delighted
in
the
novel
experience
and
was
anxious
to
meet
them
all
once
in
the
small
room
the
began
to
remove
their
and
wraps
the
ranchers
parties
then
went
out
to
make
room
barbara
turned
to
anne
and
whispered
where
can
i
find
the
maid
maid
we
have
one
here
you
know
no
maid
to
help
me
goodness
what
shall
i
do
you
supposed
to
dress
at
home
besides
these
people
do
not
powder
or
rouge
so
they
need
no
mirror
or
maid
you
see
explained
eleanor
taking
delight
in
shocking
barbara
then
i
suppose
i
will
have
to
go
out
without
a
look
at
myself
do
i
look
all
right
to
you
anne
as
she
spoke
barbara
dropped
her
evening
cloak
from
her
shoulders
and
pivoted
for
anne
benefit
her
gown
of
net
trimmed
with
elaborate
gold
embroidery
was
extremely
decollete
with
narrow
gold
bands
over
the
shoulders
performing
the
double
duty
as
sleeves
and
to
hold
the
lower
section
of
the
dress
up
in
place
barbara
turned
slowly
and
attracted
the
attention
of
brewster
polly
and
a
few
strangers
lagging
behind
to
watch
the
visitors
just
then
sary
hurried
in
from
the
she
gasped
at
the
sight
before
her
and
quickly
came
to
the
rescue
shet
yer
eyes
every
one
the
poor
dear
ah
cover
her
up
whiles
some
one
finds
her
basque
and
sary
caught
up
cape
and
wound
it
quickly
about
barbara
bare
neck
and
shoulders
child
how
come
yuh
t
fergit
the
basque
er
what
hez
happened
to
it
cried
sary
sympathetically
while
barbara
struggled
vainly
to
wrench
herself
free
from
the
wrap
that
generally
hung
in
kitchen
ah
hev
it
polly
git
the
box
nolla
gave
me
ah
let
miss
bob
wear
my
scarf
this
meant
supreme
sacrifice
for
sary
but
she
willingly
offered
the
one
and
only
treasure
to
serve
a
betrayed
friend
still
she
was
at
a
loss
to
understand
where
that
basque
could
be
finally
barbara
squirmed
free
and
brewster
managed
to
say
sary
bob
has
on
one
of
her
most
modern
evening
gowns
they
are
made
without
tops
you
know
sary
gasped
and
suddenly
collapsed
upon
the
chair
her
strained
expression
as
she
took
a
covert
look
at
the
dress
spoke
volumes
glory
be
miss
brewster
whispered
sary
hoarsely
don
mean
it
fer
trut
do
yuh
yes
sary
it
is
a
very
expensive
and
stylish
robe
an
kin
let
her
march
like
that
in
front
of
the
men
shrilled
sary
holding
both
wide
hands
over
her
heart
i
never
heard
or
dreamed
there
was
such
ignorance
in
the
world
as
i
have
found
in
colorado
now
flared
barbara
turning
and
leaving
the
sary
waited
but
a
second
then
she
cried
ah
cai
jeb
t
see
sech
sights
an
he
a
good
sary
rushed
out
to
spare
her
prey
any
shocks
and
the
other
members
of
the
party
gazed
at
each
other
doubtfully
oh
well
it
not
our
funeral
potty
said
eleanor
shall
we
join
the
dancers
asked
anne
yes
but
i
fear
bob
will
be
ostracized
said
brewster
serve
her
right
anne
and
i
told
her
not
to
dress
like
that
but
she
you
know
she
wanted
to
show
folks
the
style
explained
eleanor
taking
silent
polly
by
the
arm
and
leading
her
out
to
the
main
hall
as
they
left
the
the
girls
heard
the
fiddler
shout
git
yer
pardners
fer
the
grand
march
and
from
that
time
on
to
midnight
the
three
girls
had
the
best
fun
ever
but
poor
barbara
stood
near
the
as
isolated
as
the
plague
for
the
ranchers
dared
not
even
look
at
a
gown
without
a
top
let
alone
dance
with
the
doubtful
thing
chapter
xi
in
the
wilderness
each
day
the
four
girls
rode
along
various
trails
until
in
the
judgment
of
jeb
they
were
practiced
enough
to
take
a
longer
ride
in
the
mountains
polly
had
been
urging
jeb
to
give
a
favorable
opinion
on
their
ability
to
stand
a
prolonged
ride
to
the
flat
tops
but
he
was
careful
and
practical
and
persisted
in
making
them
try
a
greater
distance
daily
to
finally
harden
them
to
a
rough
trail
then
jeb
said
he
reckoned
the
girls
could
start
for
a
real
outing
immediately
they
planned
where
to
go
and
what
to
see
polly
outlined
a
trip
that
might
take
a
whole
day
so
they
would
have
to
take
food
and
kit
for
cooking
purposes
each
girl
would
ride
her
favorite
horse
or
burro
and
the
extra
burro
choko
could
carry
the
outfit
of
course
polly
decided
to
ride
noddy
as
the
burro
was
well
acquainted
with
her
mistress
ways
and
the
mountains
eleanor
preferred
a
burro
also
because
as
she
said
comically
if
one
falls
from
a
burro
back
it
is
not
far
to
mother
earth
the
two
other
girls
selected
horses
and
trained
for
climbing
on
the
morning
chosen
for
the
trip
brewster
and
sary
were
up
at
preparing
the
kit
and
packing
the
panniers
at
breakfast
four
eager
girls
with
wide
sombreros
on
their
heads
heavy
and
leather
puttees
covering
feet
and
limbs
talked
of
the
great
adventures
they
were
about
to
meet
with
sam
brewster
laughed
at
their
wild
imaginings
and
said
ah
wonder
but
what
will
find
a
second
lamp
hiding
place
just
think
of
the
fun
to
be
had
by
rubbing
the
lamp
and
wishing
for
things
then
jeb
brought
the
mounts
from
the
barn
and
sary
helped
him
strap
the
panniers
and
kit
to
choko
just
as
they
were
ready
to
start
sary
flew
out
with
a
paper
package
carefully
held
polly
ah
made
a
fer
but
do
let

roll
in
it
er
run

he
too
trustworthy

polly
petting
the
burro
on
the
head
wall
then
see
thet
it
hai
shooken
up
too
much
er
gittin
mashed
under
the
ax
were
the
parting
words
from
sary
as
she
shifted
the
short
ax
which
is
an
important
item
in
every
outfit
it
was
a
wonderful
summer
day
the
kind
that
makes
one
feel
happy
in
mere
living
and
the
anticipation
of
wonders
to
come
added
a
zest
to
the
outing
for
the
girls
they
left
the
trail
leading
from
pebbly
pit
and
picked
up
the
rough
mountain
trail
at
the
forks
barbara
and
eleanor
exclaiming
constantly
at
the
gorgeous
wild
flowers
growing
wherever
the
roots
could
find
lodgment
i
never
saw
such
columbines
four
times
the
size
of
ours
in
the
east
cried
eleanor
and
those
marvelous
blossoms
they
look
like
a
rare
exotic
with
their
huge
clusters
and
flaunting
colors
exclaimed
barbara
if
you
girls
think
these
are
so
beautiful
just
wait
till
we
reach
the
there
you
will
see
size
and
color
enough
to
make
you
wonder
if
you
accidentally
struck
paradise
said
anne
and
our
ferns
and
mosses
girls
you
never
saw
such
specimen
elsewhere
added
polly
churking
to
choko
to
hurry
on
polly
why
did
jeb
that
poor
little
burro
now
asked
barbara
having
lost
her
momentary
interest
in
flora
choko
is
at
all
of
course
it
looks
as
if
he
had
a
great
load
to
carry
but
pans
and
woolen
blankets
look
more
than
they
weigh
you
see
the
heaviest
thing
he
carries
is
my
ax
i
reckon
ax
what
do
you
want
of
an
ax
wondered
barbara
ca
tell
how
cold
it
may
be
up
on
the
so
i
brought
the
ax
rifle
and
other
things
in
case
we
get
the
of
a
blizzard
and
the
blankets
in
case
we
get
lost
and
need
to
camp
out
all
night
added
anne
teasingly
seeing
the
city
girls
fears
you
ca
really
mean
it
anne
surely
we
wo
lose
our
way
and
as
for
a
blizzard
well
it
is
july
laughed
barbara
it
would
be
the
first
time
we
ran
into
a
blizzard
in
july
commented
polly
but
how
is
it
possible
girl
alive
cried
barbara
possible
enough
on
the
flat
tops
the
merest
rag
of
a
cloud
finds
an
excuse
to
carry
snow
from
the
peaks
the
wonder
will
be
if
we
come
away
without
seeing
snow
fall
oh
polly
how
thrilling
exclaimed
eleanor
once
when
father
and
i
rode
over
this
same
trail
to
find
a
trapper
who
had
pelts
for
sale
we
got
caught
in
a
blizzard
we
got
the
pelts
but
we
also
got
the
storm
and
lucky
for
us
that
we
had
the
pelts
first
i
never
had
experienced
a
real
mountain
storm
but
father
had
so
he
showed
me
what
to
do
i
think
i
would
know
now
just
what
to
do
in
case
of
another
surprise
let
hope
you
wo
have
to
practice
on
us
laughed
eleanor
pretending
to
shiver
stop
your
nonsense
nolla
i
do
want
to
think
of
such
dreadful
things
cried
barbara
and
i
want
to
hear
about
how
the
pelts
saved
her
life
added
anne
it
real
interesting
bob
so
let
me
tell
them
asked
polly
and
receiving
no
unfavorable
word
or
look
she
proceeded
it
was
the
fourth
of
july
and
of
course
no
one
would
start
on
a
ride
wearing
a
coat
so
father
and
i
had
on
our
summer
clothes
after
riding
along
top
notch
trail
for
a
time
we
met
the
trapper
and
bargained
for
the
furs
then
started
back
by
a
new
trail
he
told
us
of
it
led
past
pagoda
peak
and
just
as
we
got
to
the
base
of
the
peak
and
discovered
the
the
blizzard
came
swooping
upon
us
without
warning
father
and
i
tried
to
keep
going
but
the
gale
traveled
too
fast
and
blew
in
whirling
eddies
so
we
got
the
pelts
out
of
the
bundle
and
wrapped
ourselves
in
the
largest
ones
the
smaller
ones
we
used
for
our
feet
father
found
two
great
and
covered
the
horse
that
acted
as
a
shield
on
one
side
from
the
storm
the
other
horses
stood
in
front
and
back
of
us
making
three
sides
protected
father
then
made
me
creep
with
him
to
the
refuge
made
by
the
three
horses
and
there
we
remained
the
horses
stood
perfectly
still
throughout
the
blizzard
which
lasted
only
an
hour
at
most
and
the
steam
they
exuded
from
their
bodies
kept
us
quite
warm
as
we
crouched
under
them
when
the
storm
blew
over
we
dug
a
way
out
and
removed
the
horse
blankets
and
fur
pelts
from
the
horses
then
we
rolled
our
own
coverings
into
the
bundle
and
started
on
but
the
floods
of
melting
snow
caused
and
it
was
risky
going
when
we
reached
the
first
park
never
a
sign
of
snow
was
there
and
the
only
result
of
that
mountain
blizzard
was
an
added
flood
of
water
pouring
down
the
gulleys
to
the
bottoms
and
valley
oh
polly
what
an
interesting
book
your
adventures
would
make
exclaimed
eleanor
i
like
to
write
it
down
as
you
tell
it
polly
and
we
can
surely
find
a
publisher
for
it
added
anne
eagerly
really
oh
how
i
love
to
tell
such
a
story
said
polly
all
enthusiasm
we
try
it
as
soon
as
we
get
back
promised
anne
the
going
was
easy
so
polly
told
of
other
adventures
of
the
trip
to
buffalo
park
when
a
bear
chased
them
of
her
meeting
with
old
montresor
the
of
grizzly
slide
and
his
pitiful
story
of
the
nights
spent
out
on
the
mountains
watching
beside
a
dying
or
listening
to
the
call
of
the
moose
to
his
mate
on
a
moonlit
night
of
the
wonderful
sport
fishing
in
streams
or
seeking
gorgeous
flora
and
strange
fauna
on
the
peaks
and
again
photographing
wild
beasts
and
birds
that
never
showed
a
fear
of
her
as
she
traversed
their
domains
the
three
girls
were
at
her
vivid
descriptions
and
anne
sighed
with
desire
to
put
it
all
down
on
paper
for
future
publication
montresor
mine
is
in
this
mountain
that
i
want
to
show
you
he
was
a
dear
old
man
who
lived
a
solitary
life
in
a
cabin
near
buffalo
park
patsy
his
dog
was
his
only
companion
but
he
died
and
left
me
his
mine
that
we
never
found
again
sighed
polly
oh
polly
tell
us
the
story
chorused
the
girls
polly
laughed
it
is
a
story
there
never
was
a
climax
as
real
stories
have
to
have
you
know
but
i
tell
you
how
i
met
montresor
i
was
out
with
noddy
one
day
and
we
traveled
farther
than
usual
in
leaving
a
bad
trail
to
take
a
good
one
i
met
the
man
slowly
riding
up
an
irish
terrier
ran
back
of
his
horse
sniffing
sniffing
and
whining
as
if
distracted
i
was
so
surprised
at
the
actions
that
i
stopped
to
ask
the
man
what
ailed
him
my
child
patsy
is
seeking
for
my
lost
mine
lost
mine
i
gasped
for
i
had
never
heard
of
him
or
his
mine
although
folks
said
there
was
a
rich
vein
of
gold
somewhere
in
the
mountain
footnote
this
is
a
true
incident
child
i
am
the
unfortunate
montresor
have
you
heard
of
my
great
loss
i
thought
the
poor
man
was
foolish
so
i
humored
him
by
saying
sir
i
never
did
wo
you
tell
me
about
it
then
he
told
me
the
story
he
had
been
an
old
prospector
in
the
klondike
but
not
a
successful
one
as
he
was
too
honest
on
his
return
from
alaska
he
had
to
stop
in
denver
and
work
for
his
fare
back
to
the
east
where
he
came
from
being
a
splendid
engineer
as
well
as
a
mineralogist
he
found
a
place
with
a
crew
of
mining
engineers
about
to
inspect
pagoda
peak
section
and
lost
lake
district
he
came
with
them
after
he
had
been
in
these
mountains
for
a
time
he
was
so
certain
of
finding
gold
that
he
remained
when
the
rest
of
the
crew
went
back
to
denver
after
two
years
of
patient
digging
and
prospecting
he
took
a
new
trail
that
was
later
found
to
be
red
man
trail
seldom
traveled
as
it
was
such
dangerous
and
hard
going
he
was
climbing
along
an
awful
place
where
the
ledge
hung
over
a
chasm
when
he
spied
a
small
yellow
nugget
on
the
ground
he
examined
it
and
found
it
to
be
fine
upon
looking
about
he
found
a
few
more
but
there
seemed
to
be
no
sign
of
gold
in
the
ledge
or
in
the
rocks
about
him
still
he
staked
out
a
claim
on
the
spot
in
hopes
of
later
finding
gold
hidden
in
the
ground
he
hobbled
his
horse
and
made
a
good
circuit
of
the
place
and
then
discovered
that
the
opposite
ledge
of
the
abyss
towered
up
hundreds
of
feet
higher
than
the
one
he
was
on
that
gave
him
an
idea
he
rode
the
horse
carefully
along
his
ledge
until
he
reached
a
slope
where
both
ledges
met
an
of
leaving
the
lower
ledge
and
on
the
higher
one
he
stopped
opposite
the
place
where
he
had
found
the
nuggets
he
dismounted
sought
carefully
about
and
to
his
joy
found
more
nuggets
exactly
like
the
ones
picked
up
on
the
opposite
lower
side
he
took
the
pick
from
the
saddle
and
worked
at
the
wall
facing
him
and
discovered
a
rich
lode
running
straight
in
through
the
solid
rock
he
was
so
excited
that
he
started
off
without
staking
a
claim
or
otherwise
marking
the
place
but
he
soon
remembered
and
went
back
he
made
out
a
correct
claim
and
fastened
it
to
a
tree
then
piled
up
the
necessary
heaps
of
stone
with
his
stakes
in
the
middle
doing
all
he
could
think
of
to
legally
hold
the
right
to
mine
the
ore
he
started
back
along
the
dangerous
ledge
it
was
so
dark
by
this
time
that
he
could
not
find
the
way
he
came
and
knowing
it
was
almost
impassable
he
permitted
the
horse
to
choose
a
way
out
by
going
up
the
and
so
he
finally
reached
the
summit
here
he
camped
for
the
night
and
early
in
the
morning
he
kept
on
till
he
struck
top
notch
trail
but
so
circuitous
had
been
the
route
that
he
never
could
describe
the
pathway
his
horse
took
unfortunately
he
had
left
patsy
home
that
day
to
guard
supplies
in
the
cabin
and
he
did
not
return
there
at
once
thinking
it
wiser
to
first
file
his
claims
in
oak
creek
the
clerk
asked
for
or
distances
from
the
nearest
surveyor
blaze
but
montresor
had
not
found
any
it
was
a
question
whether
the
claim
would
be
legal
but
the
worried
old
man
refused
to
give
full
details
of
the
spot
as
he
feared
the
claim
would
be
jumped
and
he
purposed
going
back
again
to
make
a
survey
for
himself
on
his
way
to
the
cabin
for
patsy
a
dreadful
storm
came
over
the
mountains
and
lasted
for
three
days
snow
hail
and
wind
blew
down
the
sides
until
it
seemed
as
if
winter
had
come
in
full
blast
of
course
no
one
would
attempt
climbing
in
that
storm
and
montresor
had
to
remain
in
his
cabin
for
the
blizzard
to
pass
when
he
was
able
to
travel
again
he
took
patsy
to
help
find
the
place
but
the
rain
had
washed
away
all
scent
for
the
dog
after
a
tortuous
climb
on
the
trail
made
worse
by
the
down
timber
and
montresor
discovered
and
knew
he
was
on
the
right
pathway
however
he
could
see
no
ravine
or
ledges
and
after
hunting
day
after
day
without
locating
a
spot
that
resembled
his
claim
he
caved
in
there
was
no
gully
no
ledge
no
wall
of
rock
with
vein
of
gold
showing
in
its
face
in
fact
so
much
rock
and
earth
and
trees
had
been
washed
down
from
top
notch
trail
during
the
great
storm
that
the
whole
area
he
had
previously
covered
had
changed
form
and
appearances
the
poor
man
then
tried
to
find
his
claim
by
following
top
notch
trail
and
coming
down
from
the
summit
but
he
was
taken
ill
and
laid
up
in
his
cabin
for
a
long
time
i
rode
up
to
see
him
whenever
i
could
and
father
wanted
him
to
have
some
one
stay
with
him
but
the
old
man
would
not
patsy
was
his
only
nurse
the
ranchers
laughed
and
said
he
was
luny
over
gold
and
that
he
never
had
seen
any
still
there
was
the
ore
to
cause
wonderment
until
a
miner
declared
it
was
some
the
old
man
had
left
in
his
kit
from
klondike
the
report
that
he
was
trying
to
sell
a
claim
that
never
existed
made
folks
shun
him
even
when
they
heard
he
was
sick
cold
weather
was
coming
on
and
mother
would
not
let
me
risk
the
long
ride
to
his
cabin
so
often
but
one
warm
saturday
i
packed
supplies
and
rode
noddy
up
there
i
found
the
poor
man
unconscious
patsy
stood
by
the
bunk
licking
the
limp
hand
i
looked
about
but
no
food
or
drink
could
i
see
i
lifted
his
gray
head
and
tried
to
make
him
sip
water
from
my
bottle
but
he
merely
opened
his
eyes
and
smiled
he
tried
to
take
something
from
under
his
head
and
i
helped
him
i
found
a
scrawl
saying
on
patsy
collar
he
tried
to
mumble
and
i
stooped
low
but
he
relaxed
suddenly
and
seemed
to
shrink
i
felt
his
heart
but
it
was
still
i
tried
his
eyes
and
they
were
sightless
patsy
sent
up
a
heartrending
wail
and
crawled
over
behind
his
master
gun
and
knapsack
so
i
knew
my
old
friend
was
dead
i
removed
the
paper
from
patsy
collar
and
saw
my
name
on
it
upon
opening
it
i
found
the
dear
man
had
left
me
all
his
interests
in
the
claim
filed
at
oak
creek
offices
i
tried
to
coax
patsy
to
come
with
me
but
he
would
not
desert
his
master
then
i
placed
water
in
a
dish
and
gave
the
animal
my
food
but
he
would
not
eat
or
drink
i
hurried
home
to
tell
father
and
he
rode
back
that
same
evening
to
arrange
for
the
old
man
burial
jeb
and
john
went
with
him
and
the
coroner
from
oak
creek
who
is
a
friend
of
ours
when
they
reached
the
cabin
they
found
faithful
patsy
stretched
across
his
master
body
dead
also
so
both
old
comrades
were
buried
together
although
the
minister
from
over
the
mountain
said
it
was
a
sin
to
place
both
in
one
grave
when
john
told
me
i
said
i
was
glad
the
two
could
travel
the
same
trail
together
for
old
man
montresor
had
found
patsy
his
best
friend
for
ten
years
we
found
no
clew
to
his
eastern
friends
and
when
the
last
will
and
testament
of
ralph
montresor
was
filed
at
oak
creek
every
one
laughed
at
us
for
believing
the
of
a
crazy
man
but
i
never
believed
he
was
crazy
and
i
do
believe
he
once
discovered
that
oh
polly
wept
anne
and
eleanor
deeply
affected
by
the
tale
but
barbara
plaintively
remarked
do
talk
of
something
cheerful
all
right
bob
i
tell
you
something
that
will
cheer
your
woeful
heart
jeered
eleanor
impatiently
i
going
to
take
that
red
soon
and
rediscover
the
mine
then
i
give
it
to
polly
for
a
present
for
her
loyalty
to
old
montresor
do
be
silly
if
you
ever
did
find
a
you
hold
on
to
it
fast
enough
retorted
barbara
eleanor
winked
at
polly
and
polly
smiled
gratefully
at
her
but
anne
broached
another
subject
to
spare
the
sisters
an
argument
the
horses
had
been
jogging
along
a
trail
that
now
turned
off
to
what
looked
like
a
wide
plain
here
the
bridge
i
been
heading
for
said
polly
from
here
on
it
clear
going
to
lone
pine
blaze
bridge
do
you
call
this
a
bridge
laughed
eleanor
it
a
forest
ranger
bridge
they
build
these
over
chasms
and
streams
so
horses
and
men
can
quickly
reach
any
part
of
the
forest
when
there
is
a
fire
if
they
had
to
ford
swift
streams
or
go
round
about
much
time
would
be
lost
the
bridge
in
question
was
made
of
loose
thrown
across
the
river
and
pegged
down
on
either
side
where
the
ends
rested
upon
the
steep
banks
after
crossing
the
polly
led
the
way
towards
what
seemed
to
be
a
veritable
wilderness
of
forest
giant
pines
thrust
their
green
tops
far
above
trees
that
would
have
been
considered
landmarks
in
the
east
but
were
deemed
quite
ordinary
in
the
west
next
in
height
to
the
pines
came
gigantic
oaks
and
then
the
still
shorter
aspens
and
pine
you
never
intend
breaking
through
that
tangle
of
trees
i
hope
polly
cried
barbara
who
had
never
seen
such
a
bewildering
growth
of
forest
in
her
life
no
not
this
time
i
making
for
that
pine
that
you
can
see
way
above
all
of
the
others
that
is
lone
pine
blaze
because
it
bears
the
blaze
that
shows
the
way
to
the
noddy
must
have
been
a
frequent
traveler
to
this
tree
for
she
knew
exactly
the
way
to
go
and
when
she
came
opposite
the
pine
that
bore
the
blaze
she
stopped
of
her
own
accord
now
was
that
cute
cried
eleanor
riding
her
burro
directly
behind
noddy
polly
jumped
from
her
burro
back
and
went
over
to
choko
she
removed
the
ax
from
the
pack
and
chopped
a
way
through
the
slender
undergrowth
which
had
grown
up
that
season
yes
here
the
blaze
as
plain
as
day
any
of
you
girls
want
to
read
it
for
me
laughed
polly
the
three
curious
girls
jumped
from
their
mounts
and
pushed
a
way
over
to
the
tree
where
they
saw
a
queer
mark
made
deep
in
the
tree
where
the
bark
could
not
it
what
does
it
say
poll
asked
eleanor
it
means
for
us
to
turn
to
the
left
and
follow
the
trail
upwards
said
polly
pointing
to
the
signs
i
should
think
the
ranchers
would
put
up
to
guide
travelers
said
barbara
how
long
do
you
suppose
a
post
would
last
in
a
mild
little
that
uproots
trees
and
tosses
them
about
like
wisps
of
hay
laughed
polly
oh
polly
you
surely
are
making
fun
of
us
said
eleanor
doubtfully
no
indeed
she
is
not
in
the
three
months
time
i
was
at
the
cobb
school
i
saw
some
terrific
gales
sweep
over
the
country
added
anne
but
and
were
forgotten
for
the
time
when
the
horses
came
out
on
a
strange
road
they
had
to
travel
the
wilderness
of
pine
forest
had
been
left
on
the
right
after
leaving
lone
pine
and
the
trail
led
down
gradually
to
a
bottomland
of
brilliant
green
herbage
directly
over
this
emerald
valley
ran
a
corduroy
roadway
there
must
have
been
a
brook
under
this
at
one
time
stated
eleanor
finding
the
logs
partly
embedded
in
caked
mud
no
this
too
is
built
by
our
who
help
the
timber
jacks
build
these
roads
you
see
while
frost
holds
good
the
heaviest
tree
trunks
can
be
readily
moved
over
icy
swamp
bottoms
but
in
the
spring
when
thaw
and
freshets
begin
the
bottoms
are
more
like
a
marsh
or
shallow
lake
than
anything
else
i
know
of
then
these
corduroy
roads
are
a
for
hard
ground
explained
polly
while
noddy
started
to
over
the
logs
why
do
the
men
wait
for
the
next
frost
asked
barbara
hoh
do
you
know
the
trees
would
be
worthless
if
they
were
left
for
a
season
decay
and
mold
or
worms
would
destroy
the
finest
wood
besides
these
logs
or
poles
laid
side
by
side
in
the
mud
soon
get
to
be
as
solid
as
a
rock
for
the
mud
oozing
up
between
the
chinks
of
the
logs
dries
out
and
leaves
them
baked
tight
in
the
grooves
having
heard
the
way
this
novel
roadway
was
made
the
girls
took
a
lively
interest
in
crossing
it
no
more
questions
were
asked
until
polly
reached
the
trail
that
led
up
through
the
forest
then
eleanor
spoke
polly
you
sure
you
know
the
road
we
ca
go
very
far
wrong
if
we
keep
to
the
trail
we
are
bound
to
come
out
on
the
top
somewhere
laughed
polly
giving
noddy
her
head
in
selecting
a
safe
footing
on
the
rough
trail
eleanor
eager
to
show
how
well
she
could
ride
forced
her
burro
past
noddy
while
the
latter
was
making
a
slight
detour
about
a
she
turned
partly
around
to
laugh
at
polly
when
her
burro
made
a
sudden
lunge
away
from
the
trail
and
at
the
same
time
a
rattlesnake
struck
out
from
its
coil
reaching
at
least
the
full
length
of
its
body
help
save
me
screamed
eleanor
frantically
but
the
brave
little
burro
knew
how
to
carry
his
rider
safely
out
of
the
way
of
the
reptile
polly
saw
the
snake
coil
for
another
strike
at
barbara
horse
which
had
almost
reached
the
place
before
eleanor
screamed
the
whole
occurrence
was
so
unexpected
and
sudden
that
barbara
had
not
seen
the
swift
flash
of
and
dark
rattler
with
great
presence
of
mind
polly
instantly
pulled
noddy
up
on
a
mound
of
ground
just
above
the
reptile
and
caught
hold
of
a
long
supple
branch
of
wood
in
another
instant
she
was
whipping
the
snake
until
it
could
not
tell
from
which
direction
the
blows
were
descending
right
left
front
or
back
in
a
moment
of
indecision
the
snake
remained
quiet
and
in
that
second
polly
brought
down
her
solid
heel
upon
its
flat
head
the
other
girls
screamed
and
turned
pale
for
they
thought
polly
had
fallen
from
her
burro
upon
the
rattler
so
quick
had
been
her
action
but
the
moment
the
daring
girl
looked
up
and
laughed
at
them
they
also
jumped
from
their
saddles
and
ran
up
to
help
polly
made
sure
the
rattler
was
quite
dead
then
took
a
forked
stick
and
held
it
up
to
view
it
had
beautiful
diamond
markings
of
on
ground
the
belly
was
of
creamy
white
and
the
tail
had
eight
rattles
attached
to
it
by
means
of
a
peculiar
fibrous
ribbon
these
rattles
seemed
to
be
of
dry
horny
skin
that
made
the
when
shaken
the
head
had
been
so
crushed
open
that
polly
could
easily
show
the
curious
girls
the
which
were
hinged
to
the
upper
jaw
when
a
rattler
intends
to
bite
its
mouth
grasps
the
object
and
these
fangs
drop
down
into
the
flesh
puncturing
tiny
holes
into
which
the
fatal
poison
flows
polly
described
the
action
of
the
bite
minutely
causing
her
hearers
to
shiver
with
dread
seeing
the
effect
her
words
had
made
she
laughed
adding
a
snake
does
not
always
bite
clear
i
mean
the
least
thing
keeps
his
teeth
from
driving
straight
into
the
flesh
so
that
the
poison
bag
can
not
empty
its
fluid
under
the
skin
it
is
often
a
loose
or
sidewise
bite
so
that
much
of
the
poison
never
enters
the
wound
that
is
why
so
many
folks
survive
bites
if
it
went
clean
and
the
poison
bag
was
emptied
under
the
skin
pwhew
polly
whistled
to
denote
her
sense
of
the
outcome
of
such
a
bite
and
barbara
cried
oh
mercy
polly
i
feel
so
sick
after
hearing
you
that
i
want
to
go
back
to
chicago
anne
laughed
at
barbara
fears
saying
we
may
not
see
another
rattler
all
summer
anyway
bob
you
perfectly
safe
while
on
a
horse
for
they
can
always
tell
when
a
rattler
is
near
and
they
avoid
it
a
rattler
will
never
go
out
of
its
own
course
to
strike
only
biting
when
one
passes
too
near
it
for
its
safety
said
polly
well
that
some
consolation
anyway
sighed
eleanor
what
do
you
want
to
do
with
this
snake
poll
asked
anne
as
the
sisters
climbed
back
into
their
saddles
goodness
me
what
would
she
do
with
it
except
to
kick
it
over
into
the
bushes
cried
barbara
polly
is
laughing
she
thinks
you
are
crazy
anne
added
eleanor
impatiently
for
she
was
eager
to
proceed
on
the
trail
well
polly
i
think
we
will
have
it
skinned
and
sent
to
denver
to
be
made
into
an
odd
handbag
for
your
mother
suggested
anne
oh
anne
how
splendid
i
wish
i
could
find
a
snake
skin
cried
eleanor
yes
anne
i
think
mother
will
love
that
added
polly
gratefully
so
the
rattler
was
moved
carefully
over
to
a
large
flat
rock
near
the
trail
where
they
could
readily
find
it
on
their
way
back
chapter
xii
the
blizzard
on
grizzly
slide
as
the
adventurers
advanced
up
the
mountainside
the
pines
grew
closer
until
it
was
almost
impossible
to
ride
between
the
great
trees
that
crowded
on
either
side
of
the
faint
trail
polly
i
do
see
how
we
can
go
much
farther
said
anne
who
had
never
before
been
as
high
as
this
oh
we
are
only
of
the
way
up
anne
smiled
polly
swinging
noddy
suddenly
to
one
side
to
avoid
a
bowlder
of
rock
that
had
rolled
upon
the
trail
after
more
arduous
climbing
the
horses
unexpectedly
came
out
into
a
vast
clearing
called
a
park
by
the
natives
it
was
acres
in
extent
fringed
about
by
the
heavy
close
growth
of
pines
the
girls
exclaimed
at
the
beauty
of
the
spot
for
flowers
grew
profusely
among
the
thick
buffalo
grass
now
then
every
one
of
you
start
at
this
point
and
hunt
for
the
trail
i
have
been
here
since
last
summer
when
we
went
for
that
trapper
and
his
pelts
i
did
look
for
the
blaze
then
but
it
was
here
so
we
must
find
it
to
help
us
find
the
way
out
called
polly
as
she
guided
noddy
slowly
past
the
fringe
of
forest
trees
looking
carefully
at
each
tree
goodness
polly
do
you
ever
expect
to
find
an
opening
in
this
tangle
of
trees
asked
barbara
we
can
if
polly
says
there
one
declared
anne
riding
her
horse
carefully
in
the
opposite
direction
from
polly
eleanor
permitted
her
burro
to
follow
after
polly
as
she
had
the
slightest
idea
of
what
the
blaze
or
trail
would
look
like
consequently
she
was
directly
behind
polly
when
she
shouted
found
it
the
other
girls
wheeled
their
horses
and
galloped
over
to
the
place
where
polly
was
swinging
the
ax
about
her
head
with
several
good
whacks
she
chopped
down
enough
young
aspens
to
clear
a
way
through
the
brush
thus
exposing
to
view
an
old
tree
bearing
a
blaze
over
twenty
years
old
i
show
you
how
to
count
the
age
said
polly
beginning
at
the
outer
bark
and
counting
the
rings
plainly
lined
from
the
new
bark
into
the
tree
until
she
reached
the
place
where
the
blaze
had
been
made
how
interesting
then
that
means
this
trail
was
made
twenty
years
ago
said
barbara
maybe
twenty
times
twenty
years
ago
for
all
we
know
nobody
really
knows
how
old
this
trail
is
for
it
was
used
by
the
indians
as
far
back
as
the
oldest
trappers
and
hunters
know
and
have
heard
tell
from
their
fathers
and
grandfathers
replied
polly
swinging
into
the
saddle
and
telling
noddy
to
proceed
the
little
burro
obediently
went
into
the
seemingly
impassable
thicket
the
other
horses
following
after
they
had
traveled
for
ten
or
fifteen
yards
the
undergrowth
thinned
until
they
were
going
on
ground
as
soft
as
moss
the
silent
forest
with
its
sentinel
pines
spreading
a
canopy
overhead
seemed
like
another
world
from
the
bright
glare
of
the
one
left
behind
that
morning
the
trees
were
so
tall
and
majestic
with
great
fragrant
green
tops
that
scarcely
allowed
a
sunbeam
to
penetrate
to
the
pale
green
twilight
underneath
that
a
solemn
peace
pervaded
the
minds
of
the
young
adventurers
the
singing
of
birds
or
the
crackling
of
dry
twigs
as
wild
creatures
sprang
over
them
were
the
only
sounds
heard
no
shrubs
or
vegetation
obstructed
this
impressive
place
so
the
girls
rode
on
in
silence
until
the
trail
ascended
again
near
the
confines
of
this
forest
polly
suddenly
reined
in
noddy
and
held
out
a
warning
hand
right
across
their
pathway
sped
a
young
deer
it
paused
by
the
side
of
a
sheltering
with
head
erect
and
poised
gracefully
gazing
steadily
at
the
strange
creatures
who
dared
intrude
upon
those
sacred
precincts
it
as
suddenly
vanished
again
and
the
girls
breathed
deeply
oh
for
our
camera
cried
eleanor
how
stupid
of
us
to
leave
it
home
added
barbara
it
always
the
way
who
remembers
a
kodak
until
it
is
needed
laughed
anne
john
promised
to
bring
me
a
fine
camera
this
summer
but
he
never
came
home
from
college
so
i
did
get
it
said
polly
wistfully
have
you
one
poll
wondered
eleanor
not
yet
it
a
shame
and
you
with
such
wonderful
ways
to
use
it
the
moment
we
get
home
i
shall
give
you
my
new
one
and
you
can
give
me
some
prints
from
it
in
exchange
said
eleanor
generously
why
eleanor
maynard
yours
is
brand
new
and
cost
forty
dollars
cried
shocked
barbara
of
course
it
new
would
i
give
my
best
friend
a
thing
retorted
eleanor
oh
nolla
it
awfully
good
of
you
but
i
would
think
of
taking
it
exclaimed
polly
gratefully
if
you
do
i
give
it
to
sary
and
then
you
can
look
for
trouble
she
snap
pictures
of
jeb
at
dinner
of
jeb
at
the
pump
and
jeb
here
there
and
everywhere
the
girls
laughed
merrily
at
the
pictures
outlined
and
the
camera
was
forgotten
after
climbing
for
two
hours
more
noddy
wrinkled
his
nose
and
twitched
his
sensitive
ears
noddy
scents
water
see
choko
is
acting
the
same
way
called
polly
and
sure
enough
both
burros
were
making
faces
at
the
in
a
short
time
the
riders
reached
another
park
but
this
one
was
not
half
the
size
of
the
first
instead
of
encircling
forest
trees
the
girls
saw
giant
of
rock
that
deft
the
blue
sky
on
each
side
of
the
widened
trail
stood
pine
that
ran
up
to
the
summit
and
down
the
other
side
of
the
peak
at
last
top
notch
trail
exclaimed
polly
you
seem
relieved
ventured
anne
i
am
because
i
whether
i
would
remember
the
right
route
without
an
older
guide
when
in
doubt
do
do
anything
suggested
eleanor
if
we
did
do
anything
we
would
have
been
up
here
argued
anne
this
trail
runs
straight
to
grizzly
slide
a
glacial
peak
i
always
wanted
to
see
father
never
had
time
to
take
me
and
mother
allow
me
to
find
it
alone
explorers
say
it
is
a
permanent
glacier
that
seldom
changes
its
form
as
most
of
our
other
peaks
do
in
summertime
how
i
love
to
see
it
sighed
eleanor
it
sounds
as
if
we
were
in
switzerland
about
to
visit
the
alps
added
barbara
have
you
any
plans
for
polly
asked
anne
nothing
particular
i
thought
we
would
try
for
this
trail
and
have
dinner
up
here
then
do
whatever
you
liked
before
starting
for
home
how
long
might
it
take
to
ride
along
the
top
and
hunt
for
grizzly
slide
asked
eleanor
eagerly
i
not
sure
of
the
distance
although
i
hear
it
is
four
miles
from
four
mile
blaze
from
here
to
the
blaze
may
be
one
or
ten
miles
but
the
going
is
fine
on
this
trail
replied
polly
eagerly
showing
her
inclinations
i
simply
wo
consider
going
back
home
yet
declared
eleanor
we
might
go
on
a
bit
further
before
eating
and
then
we
can
see
what
the
trail
is
like
if
we
decided
to
try
for
the
grizzly
poll
mentioned
i
agree
all
right
ventured
anne
the
gleam
of
adventure
shining
in
her
eyes
i
the
only
in
the
crowd
and
i
like
to
see
more
of
this
mountain
myself
laughed
barbara
said
when
barbara
talks
like
that
laughed
eleanor
so
they
continued
along
the
crest
of
the
mountain
from
which
grand
views
of
distant
peaks
and
vast
could
be
seen
the
brilliant
hues
of
wild
flowers
everywhere
mottled
the
ground
the
of
towering
pines
or
again
the
shorter
aspens
like
pickets
on
guard
in
the
foreground
the
bleached
skeletons
of
pine
burnt
clean
in
forest
fires
and
just
before
the
riders
the
plunging
water
falling
from
a
cliff
that
shut
out
any
glimpse
of
the
trail
ahead
combined
to
produce
a
of
nature
work
why
not
camp
at
those
falls
for
dinner
asked
eleanor
good
idea
i
admitted
anne
and
maybe
the
horses
can
rest
too
from
barbara
bob
going
to
join
the
soon
laughed
eleanor
no
i
not
but
horses
will
last
longer
if
you
feed
and
rest
them
and
i
do
not
care
to
walk
home
retorted
barbara
i
brought
my
fishing
tackle
girls
and
while
you
are
unpacking
dinner
i
may
as
well
cast
for
a
few
trout
in
that
stream
suggested
polly
can
you
fish
trout
exclaimed
barbara
wonderingly
can
a
bird
fly
laughed
anne
the
idea
a
westerner
and
know
how
to
fish
scorned
eleanor
but
barbara
was
not
sensitive
so
did
not
feel
offended
at
these
remarks
neither
did
she
take
pains
to
disguise
her
real
sentiments
when
it
would
have
been
kinder
to
keep
silence
on
a
subject
having
reached
the
base
of
the
cliff
the
girls
found
a
delightful
spot
for
the
luncheon
the
packs
were
slipped
from
choko
and
he
with
the
other
mounts
were
hobbled
and
left
to
graze
on
the
buffalo
grass
in
the
clearing
the
girls
unpacked
a
pannier
while
polly
arranged
her
tackle
and
started
for
the
top
of
the
cliff
whence
fell
the
water
let
me
go
with
you
poll
and
watch
asked
eleanor
if
you
wo
speak
and
mind
you
do
slip
and
fall
i
wo
promised
eleanor
crawling
up
after
the
polly
until
both
reached
the
top
to
their
surprise
the
girls
found
a
cleft
between
two
great
rocks
with
a
quiet
pool
resting
at
the
base
the
current
passed
rushing
onward
to
the
falls
but
the
water
circulating
in
the
nook
scarcely
rippled
even
as
the
two
girls
watched
a
flash
of
a
speckled
back
flounced
up
in
play
and
splashed
their
shoes
a
spot
for
trout
whispered
polly
crawling
out
to
the
rim
of
a
rock
while
eleanor
watched
breathlessly
not
too
far
out
poll
whispered
eleanor
anxiously
as
polly
leaned
over
the
edge
to
gaze
into
the
clear
depths
without
a
word
polly
carefully
cast
her
fly
far
out
upon
the
smooth
surface
of
the
sparkling
water
then
flashes
deep
down
and
in
incredibly
short
time
a
large
speckled
trout
rose
to
the
bait
and
polly
felt
her
nerves
tauten
with
the
excitement
of
the
sportsman
eleanor
held
her
breath
for
fear
the
trout
would
disappear
polly
landed
that
one
weighing
at
least
three
pounds
then
caught
two
more
weighing
about
two
pounds
each
guess
these
will
be
enough
for
this
noon
no
use
catching
more
than
we
need
remarked
polly
coming
back
to
eleanor
side
the
girls
hastened
down
the
rocks
and
brought
the
fish
over
to
the
place
where
polly
expected
to
find
a
good
fire
burning
why
i
do
see
any
fire
did
you
build
one
for
the
fish
cried
polly
you
did
tell
us
to
anyway
what
would
we
make
it
with
no
matches
and
no
kindlings
replied
barbara
ca
you
girls
start
fire
with
flint
or
some
sticks
asked
polly
curiously
the
only
fire
i
can
light
is
with
a
safety
match
and
the
valve
of
a
replied
barbara
quaintly
the
others
considered
her
remark
very
funny
and
polly
promised
to
teach
them
how
to
make
a
fire
with
two
sticks
only
do
it
now
and
fry
the
fish
for
us
said
eleanor
no
it
will
be
too
late
for
us
to
begin
all
that
now
we
had
better
wait
until
we
really
ought
to
be
on
the
trail
by
this
time
said
polly
child
alive
you
do
intend
being
out
in
the
woods
at
do
you
gasped
barbara
fearfully
polly
laughed
is
that
so
fearful
why
i
think
it
is
piles
of
fun
to
camp
out
on
a
fine
night
maybe
you
do
but
remember
the
we
may
be
sleeping
on
the
ground
when
one
comes
oh
cried
barbara
shivering
oh
come
now
bob
no
use
conjuring
up
such
gruesome
pictures
to
tickle
your
nerves
exclaimed
eleanor
impatiently
if
you
do
want
to
go
on
to
grizzly
slide
now
the
time
to
say
so
when
we
get
there
it
will
be
too
late
to
complain
about
the
lateness
of
the
hour
in
getting
home
said
sensible
polly
oh
we
all
want
to
go
to
grizzly
slide
asserted
anne
hastily
and
we
will
take
everything
that
comes
with
it
declared
eleanor
eagerly
well
all
right
but
for
the
love
of
goodness
do
let
camp
in
the
wilderness
all
night
cried
barbara
they
sat
down
after
that
discussion
and
ate
the
sandwiches
and
fruit
but
polly
wanted
a
piece
of
the
chocolate
cake
she
thought
sary
had
packed
for
them
i
could
find
any
we
looked
through
and
found
only
sandwiches
in
the
papers
said
anne
oh
pshaw
i
was
sure
there
was
cake
grumbled
polly
it
may
possibly
be
in
the
bottom
of
the
other
pannier
as
we
unpack
everything
you
know
suggested
barbara
if
it
is
we
eat
it
for
supper
at
least
we
know
sary
packed
good
for
us
added
anne
once
more
on
the
trail
the
adventurers
rode
through
forests
where
the
notes
of
unseen
birds
blending
with
the
murmur
of
pines
sounded
like
weird
music
to
the
city
girls
just
like
the
sea
roar
in
a
is
it
whispered
anne
as
she
listened
rapturously
they
passed
tumbling
hurrying
mountain
streams
where
the
burnished
trout
flashed
swiftly
back
and
forth
in
the
clear
water
they
came
to
an
upland
park
where
the
soft
whistle
of
quail
caused
polly
to
lift
her
rifle
but
the
whir
of
wings
told
of
a
flight
from
jagged
rents
in
the
cliffs
through
which
the
horses
passed
their
hoofs
ringing
echoes
from
the
rock
they
came
to
sleepy
hollows
where
the
quaker
aspens
stood
ghostlike
as
sentinels
on
guard
before
their
beautiful
eden
having
climbed
one
peak
and
descended
it
then
the
next
one
and
so
on
and
on
following
the
winding
trail
that
became
more
difficult
to
find
and
more
dangerous
to
climb
polly
finally
drew
rein
beside
a
tree
distinctly
scarred
hurrah
the
blaze
to
the
slide
shouted
she
scraping
away
the
lichen
that
covered
the
spot
glad
of
an
excuse
to
jump
down
and
stretch
their
limbs
the
other
girls
joined
polly
at
the
tree
and
saw
the
blaze
although
so
old
to
be
perfectly
plain
and
easily
traced
four
miles
to
grizzly
slide
read
polly
exultantly
but
it
must
be
three
or
more
when
can
we
hope
to
get
back
home
murmured
barbara
glancing
down
the
trail
they
just
left
too
late
to
worry
about
that
now
said
eleanor
i
plan
to
see
grizzly
slide
and
then
camp
somewhere
said
polly
that
is
the
best
thing
now
added
anne
you
do
mean
to
sleep
out
in
this
awful
wilderness
do
you
gasped
barbara
no
we
going
to
engage
a
suite
of
rooms
at
the
victoria
for
jeered
eleanor
i
hope
to
reach
the
slide
and
ride
back
to
those
falls
for
camp
we
have
fish
and
pasture
and
soft
moss
there
said
polly
ideal
place
too
approved
anne
but
the
wild
beasts
and
oh
suppose
a
rattler
comes
along
while
we
are
asleep
almost
sobbed
barbara
he
steer
clear
of
you
bob
retorted
eleanor
come
on
girls
do
waste
time
arguing
or
we
camp
on
top
of
the
peak
yonder
laughed
polly
jumping
back
into
her
saddle
and
urging
noddy
along
the
way
although
grizzly
slide
was
but
four
miles
from
the
blaze
the
trail
was
so
rough
that
the
horses
had
to
go
slowly
too
the
rarefied
air
strained
the
animals
hearts
and
polly
advised
frequent
halts
to
rest
the
heavily
breathing
beasts
during
those
four
miles
the
trail
often
opened
from
the
heavy
timber
and
gave
a
glimpse
of
valleys
and
dreadfully
nearby
abysses
that
made
one
feel
that
one
was
on
top
of
the
world
even
the
pines
in
the
nearer
crests
and
clefts
looked
like
wisps
of
green
so
small
they
appeared
from
the
tremendous
height
the
trail
finally
led
through
a
thick
forest
of
pine
that
looked
interminable
but
suddenly
ended
at
a
line
as
if
it
had
been
purposely
cleared
away
the
riders
all
sat
in
silent
awe
at
the
sight
before
them
they
had
reached
grizzly
slide
the
peak
reaching
an
altitude
from
the
clearing
where
they
stood
of
at
least
a
thousand
feet
sheer
up
dazzled
their
eyes
in
the
bright
sunshine
to
the
left
of
the
peak
the
sides
dropped
down
almost
perpendicularly
to
the
level
floor
of
a
valley
many
thousand
feet
below
to
the
right
the
stretched
across
a
vast
area
before
any
timber
could
be
seen
on
the
downward
slope
the
snow
of
the
slide
was
continually
melting
in
summer
and
furnishing
icy
streams
that
cut
through
in
every
direction
to
reach
the
vales
far
down
the
temperature
was
almost
at
freezing
point
near
the
peak
and
the
girls
quickly
donned
their
sweaters
which
had
been
packed
in
choko
panniers
in
removing
the
sweaters
polly
accidentally
pulled
out
a
heavy
coil
of
rope
but
hung
it
back
on
one
of
the
knobs
of
choko
harness
instead
of
buckling
it
inside
the
pocket
well
she
did
too
come
on
girls
i
want
to
see
what
that
blue
line
is
over
on
the
said
polly
starting
up
the
slide
the
horses
were
and
so
the
girls
rode
as
safely
as
if
on
the
mossy
trail
but
they
had
not
gone
far
before
polly
began
murmuring
to
herself
what
the
matter
wondered
anne
aloud
that
blue
line
looks
to
me
like
a
crevice
in
the
ice
what
of
that
asked
barbara
stupidly
that
shows
something
queer
this
slide
seldom
cracks
into
fissures
but
when
it
does
it
means
trouble
if
that
crevice
goes
down
very
deep
it
shows
unusual
warmth
underneath
and
that
may
move
this
upper
section
of
any
time
thus
creating
an
awful
you
see
oh
mercy
let
hurry
back
cried
barbara
wheeling
her
horse
immediately
it
is
likely
to
occur
as
quickly
as
that
bob
said
anne
soothingly
then
turning
to
polly
said
but
this
slide
is
said
to
be
stationary
it
moved
but
so
seldom
that
folks
never
fear
it
i
know
something
about
after
living
in
pebbly
pit
for
fourteen
years
and
even
a
little
slide
at
the
lava
cliffs
causes
an
awful
destruction
so
i
can
picture
what
this
gigantic
slide
would
do
if
it
ever
got
started
down
you
said
it
happened
when
montresor
mine
was
buried
reminded
eleanor
yes
a
small
one
then
and
it
may
happen
again
so
we
wo
stay
another
moment
begged
barbara
from
a
distance
it
all
right
at
present
bob
and
i
going
to
see
if
the
chasm
runs
along
very
far
returned
polly
riding
noddy
away
from
the
girls
anne
and
eleanor
watched
the
blinding
peak
where
clouds
drifted
lazily
about
so
that
the
top
of
the
crest
was
visible
only
now
and
then
at
such
times
the
sun
flashed
upon
the
ice
and
reflected
myriad
colors
as
in
a
rainbow
is
it
just
beautiful
sighed
anne
as
wonderful
and
beautiful
as
his
satanic
majesty
declared
eleanor
but
she
anxiously
watched
polly
ride
along
the
brink
of
the
fissure
oh
girls
wo
you
please
come
home
i
wo
be
easy
till
my
horse
is
traveling
that
corduroy
road
again
wailed
barbara
the
others
laughed
you
complained
about
when
we
crossed
it
the
time
may
come
when
you
be
glad
to
be
standing
on
grizzly
slide
after
it
has
slid
teased
eleanor
now
i
going
back
so
there
threatened
barbara
but
she
remained
exactly
where
she
was
for
she
feared
to
go
back
alone
well
it
looks
as
if
we
would
have
to
return
unrewarded
i
ca
find
a
place
safe
enough
to
cross
to
the
peak
and
the
crevice
seems
to
run
all
the
way
across
and
deep
down
too
said
polly
coming
back
to
join
anne
and
eleanor
now
will
you
come
back
nagged
barbara
desperately
in
a
minute
we
want
to
watch
those
clouds
they
are
so
beautiful
sighed
anne
but
even
as
she
spoke
the
fleecy
clouds
of
snowy
white
changed
quickly
to
gray
from
gray
they
turned
to
dark
colors
and
polly
hastily
glanced
at
the
sun
let
ride
back
at
once
said
she
shortly
illustration
noddy
led
the
way
to
timber
as
the
blizzard
began
anew
noddy
was
turned
and
urged
to
lead
off
as
fast
as
possible
but
polly
turned
every
few
moments
to
watch
the
clouds
now
gathering
in
somber
banks
and
falling
down
over
the
slide
girls
make
more
haste
ordered
she
what
the
matter
poll
called
anne
who
was
in
the
rear
i
want
to
get
to
the
timber
line
just
as
fast
as
we
can
travel
do
waste
breath
talking
just
cried
polly
fearfully
i
told
you
to
come
home
i
knew
something
terrible
would
happen
up
here
wailed
barbara
trying
to
push
her
horse
by
leaning
far
over
his
neck
yes
you
always
were
a
calamity
jane
if
we
left
you
down
with
the
we
would
have
been
so
cried
eleanor
in
her
nervousness
noddy
dear
wo
you
go
faster
we
must
set
a
better
pace
for
the
others
you
see
pet
said
polly
to
her
little
burro
apparently
noddy
understood
the
need
of
a
brisker
step
for
she
started
so
that
she
soon
the
others
and
polly
had
to
wait
for
them
as
she
waited
impatiently
she
watched
the
clouds
sweeping
down
and
along
over
the
then
she
remembered
the
rope
hung
on
choko
collar
she
jumped
off
grabbed
it
and
soon
had
choko
securely
fastened
to
the
end
of
the
rope
another
loop
was
fastened
to
collar
as
the
others
rode
up
she
tied
a
loop
to
each
mount
so
that
a
chain
was
made
of
the
five
animals
is
it
a
blizzard
or
a
tornado
poll
gasped
anne
do
know
just
race
on
as
fast
as
you
can
then
as
they
hurried
across
the
icy
slope
the
sun
seemed
suddenly
quenched
and
the
daylight
turned
to
sodden
drab
heavy
drifts
of
snow
could
be
seen
falling
headlong
from
the
clouds
hanging
about
the
peak
making
a
wonderful
if
awesome
sight
girls
our
lives
are
in
jeopardy
unless
we
reach
the
timber
belt
shouted
polly
trying
to
outcry
the
wind
that
shrieked
down
the
slide
noddy
brave
little
burro
quivered
in
dread
of
the
elements
sweeping
about
them
but
she
responded
to
polly
call
and
fairly
dragged
the
trembling
choko
after
her
the
hurricane
was
now
screaming
about
the
peak
and
howling
horribly
through
the
fissures
in
the
ice
as
the
blizzard
gathered
fury
and
strength
the
clouds
like
rags
torn
from
the
sky
raged
past
the
riders
every
now
and
then
sweeping
the
snow
completely
over
them
still
the
full
fury
of
the
gale
had
not
yet
appeared
polly
stopped
momentarily
and
yelled
back
her
orders
every
one
grab
hold
on
the
tail
of
the
horse
in
front
of
you
they
comprehended
the
sense
of
this
advice
but
could
not
manage
to
act
upon
it
as
the
drifts
of
snow
and
ice
made
it
impossible
to
jump
from
the
saddle
or
lean
over
to
hold
to
anything
by
this
time
everything
was
hidden
from
sight
and
even
the
foremost
rider
looked
ghostlike
in
the
gray
light
and
snow
the
trail
was
obliterated
by
the
drifts
and
the
going
was
slippery
and
slow
we
simply
to
make
that
timber
girls
shouted
polly
more
to
encourage
than
to
urge
as
she
knew
the
beasts
were
doing
their
utmost
the
three
other
girls
too
cold
and
frightened
to
speak
clung
to
their
animals
hopelessly
noddy
seemed
imbued
with
supernatural
powers
for
she
never
made
a
or
swerved
from
the
trail
although
it
was
invisible
this
instinct
of
scent
so
marvelous
in
these
little
burros
proved
the
salvation
of
the
adventurers
then
darkness
fell
completely
and
the
storm
broke
loose
in
its
fierce
madness
so
confusing
the
chain
of
horses
that
they
stamped
and
turned
until
the
rope
was
so
tangled
that
the
riders
were
threatened
with
being
thrown
even
in
that
awful
moment
polly
was
glad
she
tied
the
beasts
for
surely
one
or
another
of
them
would
have
bolted
or
strayed
to
doom
with
its
rider
noddy
seemed
the
only
animal
to
keep
her
sense
as
the
other
horses
snorted
and
wheeled
polly
cried
desperately
noddy
noddy
ca
you
help
us
out
with
a
tremendous
spurt
of
strength
the
little
burro
pulled
herself
free
from
the
tangle
dragging
choko
along
too
the
other
horses
soon
calmed
down
again
and
followed
in
the
wake
a
glassy
surface
had
formed
over
everything
so
that
a
slip
would
prove
extremely
dangerous
on
that
steep
slide
but
noddy
plodded
along
as
if
she
knew
that
the
responsibility
of
all
depended
upon
her
accuracy
in
trailing
the
girls
had
to
trust
blindly
to
the
burro
sixth
sense
as
no
one
could
see
whether
a
yawning
chasm
or
a
rocky
projection
was
directly
before
them
polly
i
falling
i
ca
stick
on
another
moment
cried
anne
her
voice
reaching
polly
as
the
wind
blew
in
that
direction
anne
stewart
you
we
right
at
the
now
and
be
ashamed
to
say
you
gave
in
before
barbara
shrilled
polly
to
give
her
friend
new
endurance
i
all
in
too
wailed
the
plaintive
voice
of
eleanor
oh
dear
god
tell
me
what
to
do
screamed
polly
as
if
she
must
the
almighty
hear
and
help
just
as
all
seemed
at
its
worst
the
wind
suddenly
died
down
and
the
gloomy
mantle
of
darkness
lifted
perceptibly
polly
felt
sure
the
cessation
of
wind
and
sleet
was
but
a
lull
before
a
second
and
worse
but
she
made
the
most
of
the
interval
one
more
step
girls
and
we
are
safe
keep
up
courage
to
noddy
she
crooned
anxiously
now
or
never
again
little
one
noddy
turned
momentarily
to
look
into
her
beloved
mistress
eyes
as
if
to
plead
for
breath
and
a
moment
rest
and
then
she
responded
to
the
call
of
necessity
and
led
the
staggering
line
to
the
timber
just
as
the
gale
began
anew
it
was
darker
in
the
forest
of
pine
than
out
on
the
but
the
timber
offered
comparative
refuge
from
the
driving
sleet
and
wind
another
difficulty
presented
itself
however
in
the
close
growth
of
trees
to
avoid
collision
with
the
crowded
trunks
it
became
necessary
to
undo
the
rope
that
held
the
five
beasts
together
each
was
thus
allowed
to
roam
his
own
way
and
this
was
the
more
hazardous
as
the
hurricane
ofttimes
tore
up
a
smaller
pine
and
twisting
it
about
like
a
flung
it
down
like
a
straw
noddy
seemed
possessed
to
travel
in
a
certain
direction
so
polly
sure
of
a
burro
instinct
for
shelter
and
refuge
gave
her
her
head
eleanor
burro
also
seemed
anxious
to
go
in
the
same
direction
noddy
took
and
followed
in
her
footsteps
but
choko
freed
from
the
detaining
rope
and
not
so
worn
by
battling
the
gale
with
a
rider
to
carry
made
for
a
spot
to
the
right
of
noddy
suddenly
eleanor
screamed
and
pointed
at
choko
oh
look
quick
choko
choko
even
as
she
cried
choko
was
seen
frantically
scrambling
on
the
verge
of
a
cliff
and
suddenly
vanished
over
its
side
chapter
xiii
a
night
in
the
cave
oh
my
little
choko
sobbed
polly
quickly
turning
noddy
to
go
down
to
the
edge
of
the
precipice
where
the
burro
had
slipped
over
and
down
now
we
have
a
thing
to
eat
and
no
blankets
for
the
night
i
knew
this
was
a
foolish
outing
complained
barbara
eleanor
failed
to
hear
her
sister
selfish
remark
for
she
was
driving
her
burro
closely
upon
noddy
heels
anne
was
so
impatient
at
barbara
that
she
urged
her
horse
after
eleanor
to
keep
herself
busy
good
gracious
am
i
to
sit
here
alone
and
freeze
i
sure
i
not
such
a
fool
as
to
have
the
same
thing
happen
to
me
as
it
did
to
choko
cried
barbara
but
the
wind
carried
her
words
back
to
grizzly
slide
polly
slid
from
her
saddle
and
stretched
out
flat
upon
the
brink
to
peer
over
the
edge
for
a
possible
sight
of
the
burro
as
she
did
so
she
saw
a
mass
of
baggage
and
burro
scramble
upright
and
shake
itself
violently
then
a
plaintive
whinny
rose
up
to
welcome
the
fearful
girls
whoa
whoa
choko
shouted
polly
instantly
jumping
up
she
called
to
eleanor
choko
fell
upon
a
ledge
but
there
a
great
hole
behind
him
and
should
he
back
he
will
surely
fall
in
and
be
lost
i
going
down
to
lead
him
out
oh
polly
do
risk
your
precious
life
for
a
burro
screamed
barbara
hysterically
if
noddy
can
creep
down
i
save
choko
without
risk
to
myself
declared
polly
climbing
in
the
saddle
if
polly
goes
i
go
too
exclaimed
eleanor
turning
her
burro
to
follow
noddy
do
you
dare
nolla
think
of
mother
grieving
for
you
and
me
left
alone
in
colorado
helpless
cried
barbara
now
i
going
anyway
i
like
mother
to
appreciate
me
was
eleanor
unexpected
reply
but
anne
caught
an
undaunted
look
in
the
girl
eyes
the
combined
persuasions
of
barbara
and
anne
had
no
effect
on
eleanor
who
truth
to
tell
exulted
in
this
daring
feat
and
would
not
have
missed
the
thrill
for
anything
but
her
burro
balked
at
the
point
where
noddy
began
the
descent
noddy
was
making
for
a
place
where
the
ledge
met
the
downward
slope
of
the
the
burro
felt
about
for
sure
footing
and
then
took
a
step
forward
prodding
carefully
again
she
took
the
next
step
and
so
on
sometimes
feeling
suspiciously
she
would
essay
a
step
and
as
suddenly
bring
back
her
hoof
before
breaking
into
the
pit
thus
taking
one
assured
step
after
another
she
finally
reached
the
beginning
of
the
ledge
where
choko
had
landed
upon
the
where
the
frozen
girls
and
beasts
trembled
the
wind
howled
and
the
blizzard
swept
along
between
the
trunk
of
trees
but
on
the
ledge
polly
found
comparative
shelter
and
only
now
and
then
a
blast
of
the
gale
she
stopped
to
beckon
to
eleanor
and
then
urged
noddy
along
the
foothold
cleft
from
the
cliff
above
the
rose
to
the
beneath
polly
could
not
gauge
the
depth
it
was
too
dreadful
and
was
now
blurred
by
fine
drifts
from
the
blizzard
after
what
seemed
an
age
polly
reached
choko
who
still
stood
obedient
to
his
mistress
command
of
whoa
but
he
shook
and
seemed
completely
broken
up
with
fear
and
the
shock
of
the
fall
dear
little
choko
purred
polly
jumping
from
noddy
back
and
softly
patting
the
burro
woolly
face
the
burro
affectionately
nosed
polly
who
gazed
quickly
at
what
she
thought
to
be
a
pit
back
of
the
little
beast
she
gasped
in
wonderment
and
went
to
the
dark
hole
then
she
quickly
ran
back
and
took
hold
of
noddy
and
choko
bridles
standing
thus
she
shouted
to
the
anxious
girls
above
come
down
as
carefully
as
i
did
and
here
you
will
find
a
cave
with
that
she
disappeared
into
the
yawning
black
hole
leading
both
burros
barbara
and
anne
stared
at
each
other
in
amazement
and
the
latter
said
come
carefully
anything
is
better
than
freezing
here
eleanor
had
already
reached
the
ledge
when
polly
came
forth
from
the
cavern
to
shout
out
advices
the
two
older
girls
made
the
perilous
descent
safely
and
then
guided
their
horses
along
the
ledge
until
all
stood
before
the
cave
where
the
burros
were
waiting
is
this
a
miracle
cried
polly
the
moment
all
were
safe
and
the
poor
beasts
were
being
led
inside
the
refuge
the
girls
laughed
and
cried
hysterically
when
they
saw
the
haven
but
the
animals
seemed
uneasy
and
noddy
came
up
to
polly
with
fear
apparent
in
her
expressive
eyes
noddy
are
you
frightened
surely
no
wild
beast
can
be
in
here
at
present
queried
polly
looking
around
in
the
polly
what
can
it
be
shrieked
barbara
clinging
to
anne
in
fear
better
get
out
again
polly
suggested
eleanor
seeing
the
horses
paw
the
floor
and
strain
their
eyes
to
see
are
we
safe
here
polly
dear
asked
anne
safer
here
than
up
there
returned
polly
and
as
she
spoke
a
great
tree
was
flung
down
over
the
edge
of
the
gorge
just
where
ledge
and
slope
met
now
we
ca
crawl
out
if
we
wanted
to
the
tree
obstructs
the
way
declared
polly
decidedly
but
we
must
see
what
it
is
that
disturbs
the
animals
advised
anne
i
rather
throw
myself
over
the
cliff
than
be
clawed
to
bits
by
a
panther
wailed
barbara
the
horses
are
quieting
down
now
and
noddy
seems
as
much
at
home
as
anywhere
so
i
reckon
it
was
only
strangeness
that
made
them
act
queer
said
eleanor
but
something
may
pounce
out
upon
us
and
take
us
unawares
wailed
barbara
i
propose
to
smoke
them
out
as
soon
as
i
make
a
fire
said
polly
looking
about
in
the
darkness
of
the
cave
for
a
possible
stick
of
wood
but
not
finding
any
i
have
to
chop
some
of
that
pine
noddy
can
carry
me
safer
than
i
can
walk
on
this
ledge
so
i
want
you
girls
to
promise
to
keep
the
horses
close
about
you
and
wait
right
here
until
i
get
back
said
polly
taking
the
ax
from
the
pack
polly
i
coming
too
two
axes
are
better
than
one
and
i
can
ride
my
burro
too
declared
eleanor
anne
and
polly
sent
the
girl
a
look
of
gratitude
while
barbara
was
speechless
until
after
eleanor
started
to
go
then
she
remonstrated
volubly
the
two
girls
crept
toward
the
pine
and
eleanor
said
we
need
wood
for
a
fire
wo
we
yes
we
will
have
to
remain
in
the
cave
all
night
and
it
gets
so
terribly
cold
upon
these
mountain
peaks
that
we
will
be
frozen
unless
we
warm
up
the
interior
of
the
cavern
then
too
we
may
need
to
keep
fires
going
at
the
back
end
of
the
cave
as
well
as
in
front
to
ward
off
wild
beasts
they
were
slowly
advancing
when
another
awful
crash
came
from
the
slope
above
both
girls
ducked
instinctively
but
the
decayed
pine
that
was
broken
off
above
ground
fell
over
the
edge
of
the
cliff
just
in
front
of
them
and
obstructed
the
way
so
that
progress
was
impossible
eleanor
quaked
and
cried
oh
let
go
back
polly
but
polly
laughed
glory
be
our
came
to
us
halfway
at
her
cheerful
words
eleanor
braced
up
again
polly
jumped
from
noddy
back
and
started
to
hew
at
the
soft
decayed
wood
it
was
easy
to
chop
and
would
furnish
a
flaring
fire
even
though
it
would
burn
rapidly
and
need
constant
replenishing
nolla
this
is
the
second
miracle
had
we
hunted
the
mountain
over
no
better
wood
could
have
been
found
for
just
our
need
yonder
on
that
other
pine
when
this
is
out
of
our
way
awaits
our
bedding
what
funny
bedding
just
you
wait
and
see
when
enough
wood
was
chopped
to
clear
a
way
on
the
ledge
polly
showed
eleanor
how
to
make
bundles
of
it
these
were
tied
by
means
of
the
rope
to
noddy
harness
and
carefully
dragged
back
to
the
cave
several
trips
had
to
be
made
before
both
burros
had
brought
the
firewood
to
the
growing
pile
in
the
cave
when
polly
spoke
of
cutting
balsam
for
beds
anne
offered
to
help
as
she
was
so
cold
and
leave
me
here
alone
cried
barbara
why
do
you
come
with
us
asked
eleanor
i
dead
i
ca
do
another
thing
then
stay
here
and
cheer
the
burros
said
eleanor
i
wo
let
every
one
of
you
go
and
leave
me
to
be
killed
by
a
wild
animal
shuddered
barbara
looking
over
her
shoulder
nothing
wild
here
but
you
bob
however
you
may
light
a
fire
for
us
while
we
are
gone
retorted
eleanor
unsympathetically
without
further
comment
barbara
was
left
and
soon
the
girls
were
stripping
the
spruce
which
had
blown
over
the
ledge
its
green
branches
would
make
the
softest
of
beds
it
really
was
fortunate
that
both
these
trees
came
down
when
they
did
we
would
have
to
remove
them
as
obstacles
to
our
going
out
in
the
morning
and
i
would
have
had
to
hunt
well
before
i
could
have
found
such
fine
tinder
so
i
really
saved
myself
a
double
chopping
said
polly
as
they
tied
up
the
last
bundle
of
evergreen
branches
and
started
the
burros
for
the
cave
i
just
frozen
and
i
wish
you
would
hurry
and
build
a
fire
cried
barbara
petulantly
when
the
girls
came
within
hearing
no
one
replied
but
eleanor
was
furious
while
the
others
were
impatient
with
the
girl
i
was
so
hungry
that
i
tried
to
get
a
sandwich
out
of
the
pannier
but
something
made
a
noise
back
in
the
cave
and
i
sure
it
was
a
buzzing
added
barbara
trying
to
win
sympathy
from
the
companions
pooh
you
got
on
the
brain
it
would
have
done
you
good
to
get
out
there
with
us
and
do
some
rattling
of
the
ax
on
the
wood
why
nolla
how
unkind
you
are
since
we
came
to
this
awful
country
cried
barbara
not
able
to
find
a
handkerchief
and
sniffing
audibly
here
use
this
to
amuse
yourself
with
while
work
said
eleanor
taking
a
neatly
folded
handkerchief
from
her
coat
pocket
when
eleanor
turned
again
to
the
others
she
found
anne
had
unharnessed
the
burros
and
piled
the
saddles
upon
a
stone
projection
near
the
opening
of
the
cave
there
were
numerous
little
caves
that
branched
out
from
the
main
cave
but
they
led
nowhere
and
seemed
empty
polly
noticed
that
the
dry
leaves
and
loose
shale
scattered
about
appeared
to
have
been
undisturbed
for
months
some
of
the
leaves
were
from
the
harvest
of
the
previous
fall
so
she
felt
sure
no
beast
had
prowled
about
the
fingers
coming
to
a
much
larger
extension
than
any
of
the
others
had
been
polly
called
out
this
must
be
the
thumb
of
the
hand
sure
it
is
the
arm
laughed
eleanor
ah
i
thought
so
now
i
have
it
murmured
polly
finding
a
nest
of
leaves
and
soft
feathers
packed
down
with
bits
of
fur
and
dry
grass
what
have
you
found
eagerly
asked
three
voices
the
lair
of
a
grizzly
i
got
him
cried
polly
triumphantly
instantly
three
girls
screamed
and
turned
to
run
and
polly
laughed
i
got
him
on
the
girls
he
ca
get
in
with
that
fire
smoking
his
front
doorway
you
see
oh
hurry
back
and
pile
more
wood
on
the
fire
cried
eleanor
quaking
with
fear
yes
yes
polly
come
away
and
let
build
more
fires
added
barbara
not
knowing
which
one
of
the
girls
to
hide
behind
and
looking
at
the
horses
as
if
pondering
a
refuge
with
them
what
and
use
all
of
our
first
before
dawn
if
you
waste
the
wood
now
what
will
you
do
when
old
grizzly
comes
prowling
home
and
finds
your
fires
dying
down
said
polly
well
do
have
one
of
us
go
and
tend
the
fire
carefully
so
it
possibly
die
down
and
let
him
in
added
anne
we
are
almost
through
exploring
so
we
may
as
well
finish
then
we
will
all
go
and
have
supper
and
feed
the
animals
the
remainder
of
the
cave
proved
to
be
a
rocky
wall
gradually
sloping
down
until
it
reached
the
entrance
again
but
just
at
one
side
of
the
thumb
was
an
aperture
from
which
the
wind
blew
in
as
could
be
seen
when
polly
held
her
torch
down
to
the
opening
that
leads
out
somewhere
and
that
opening
is
big
enough
to
let
a
panther
creep
through
or
a
i
like
to
crawl
through
there
and
make
sure
where
it
comes
out
and
if
it
is
quite
safe
on
the
other
side
suggested
polly
looking
at
the
girls
oh
polly
dear
do
do
it
suppose
something
should
happen
to
you
cried
anne
why
i
would
let
it
anne
if
i
creep
through
that
tunnel
shove
the
torch
in
first
and
keep
it
moving
ahead
of
me
all
the
way
so
that
nothing
could
grab
me
you
see
said
polly
half
laughingly
i
say
polly
let
well
enough
alone
let
go
back
and
get
supper
and
rest
for
advised
barbara
but
just
a
was
coiled
up
inside
that
tunnel
a
burro
would
smell
it
and
it
could
crawl
out
during
the
night
and
take
a
good
straight
bite
teased
eleanor
polly
laughed
but
barbara
thought
eleanor
meant
it
so
she
replied
then
polly
had
better
go
in
and
see
if
everything
is
safe
for
the
night
anne
had
been
so
rudely
shocked
that
day
at
the
selfishness
apparent
in
barbara
character
that
she
did
not
try
to
hide
her
opinion
the
wonder
was
that
she
ever
could
have
been
so
completely
taken
in
during
the
months
in
denver
as
to
declare
barbara
to
be
a
splendid
girl
when
one
knew
her
she
now
decided
that
it
took
ranch
life
and
mountain
exploits
to
show
up
genuine
characteristics
and
thoughts
polly
i
go
in
first
offered
eleanor
dropping
to
her
knees
to
crawl
in
at
the
opening
eleanor
maynard
come
back
here
cried
barbara
taking
hold
of
her
sister
feet
nolla
you
sha
take
the
glory
from
me
laughed
polly
meantime
eleanor
was
pulled
back
and
rolled
over
laughing
as
heartily
as
if
she
were
at
a
now
listen
to
me
advised
polly
shaking
a
finger
at
the
three
girls
first
of
all
anne
and
bob
must
go
and
watch
the
fires
then
unpack
the
panniers
and
next
make
beds
of
the
tips
you
know
how
anne
i
watched
the
school
children
at
bear
forks
weave
it
so
i
sure
i
can
make
them
too
replied
anne
good
you
stick
the
little
under
the
soft
fuzz
of
the
others
just
laid
the
principal
thing
is
not
to
have
hard
prods
hurting
the
body
and
the
tips
will
take
care
of
the
springs
and
softness
all
right
said
polly
while
anne
is
making
the
beds
bob

fix
up
odds
and
ends
of

a

in
each
finger
bob
if
the
animals
are
comfortably
bedded
down
they
will
be
fresh
in
the
morning
and
if
we
hide
them
in
those
fingers
the
scent
will
not
be
so
apt
to
reach
a
grizzly
or
lion
should
any
prowl
about
where
shall
i
place
the
spruce
beds
for
us
asked
anne
fix
up
two
on
each
side
of
the
cave
as
near
the
entrance
as
possible
anne
we
need
air
and
the
warmth
from
the
fires
then
too
we
can
hear
any
wild
beast
that
may
prowl
around
advised
polly
if
nolla
wants
to
go
with
me
she
takes
place
see
eleanor
laughed
and
said
anywhere
as
long
as
we
start
polly
first
i
want
you
to
promise
me
not
to
be
reckless
in
going
through
that
tunnel
if
you
meet
with
the
slightest
danger
or
hazard
promise
to
back
right
out
again
begged
anne
all
right
anne
i
promise
but
my
shoes
will
mar
my
follower
beauty
if
i
back
down
on
her
face
thus
joking
to
make
little
of
the
danger
polly
started
in
through
the
hole
eleanor
followed
and
the
two
older
girls
stood
watching
until
not
a
sound
or
ray
of
the
torch
could
be
seen
then
they
went
to
the
front
of
the
cave
to
replenish
the
fires
and
prepare
supper
chapter

old
montresor
legacy
i
afraid
to
fix
the
beds
in
those
finger
caves
anne
whimpered
barbara
coming
over
to
where
the
young
woman
was
weaving
the
beds
of
spruce
what
is
there
to
be
afraid
of
the
burros
and
horses
wo
hurt
you
and
they
are
too
weary
with
this
day
troubles
to
bother
about
kicking
or
trampling
you
however
you
can
do
this
if
you
like
and
i
will
make
up
the
beds
for
the
beasts
the
spruce
beds
were
being
made
anne
showing
barbara
how
to
lay
the
tips
in
rows
as
wide
as
the
bed
was
to
be
then
folding
under
the
sticks
of
the
second
row
to
run
under
the
tips
of
the
first
row
and
so
on
until
the
length
of
the
bed
was
made
this
work
finished
and
the
bedding
for
the
horses
arranged
in
the
fingers
as
polly
had
directed
the
two
girls
stood
near
the
entrance
of
the
cave
wondering
what
possibly
could
have
happened
to
keep
polly
and
eleanor
so
long
i
just
felt
in
my
bones
that
it
was
an
awful
risk
to
go
into
the
black
hole
of
the
unknown
cried
barbara
it
is
that
that
bothers
me
at
all
bob
but
polly
has
no
sense
of
fear
and
i
think
they
may
have
found
an
exit
at
the
other
end
so
polly
is
coming
around
that
way
it
is
a
hazardous
thing
to
do
in
this
storm
said
anne
anne
ca
you
try
to
squeeze
in
there
and
see
what
has
happened
asked
barbara
anne
looked
at
her
without
saying
a
word
so
barbara
thought
she
hesitated
on
account
of
leaving
her
alone
in
the
cave
i
wo
mind
staying
alone
for
a
little
time
i
watch
the
fires
and
see
that
the
horses
do
not
get
away
said
barbara
really
was
all
anne
said
as
she
turned
to
place
another
pine
knot
on
the
fire
but
the
tone
silenced
barbara
who
had
food
for
thought
thereafter
meanwhile
polly
and
eleanor
had
crawled
into
the
aperture
and
by
dint
of
squirming
and
twisting
through
the
passage
found
that
only
the
section
nearest
the
cave
was
of
soft
debris
it
gradually
widened
as
they
advanced
and
polly
distinctly
felt
a
current
of
cold
air
blowing
in
her
face
after
creeping
along
for
some
distance
without
finding
an
outlet
eleanor
pulled
on
polly
foot
to
attract
her
attention
let
go
back
poll
no
use
hunting
down
in
the
bowels
of
grizzly
slide
nolla
the
smoke
of
the
torch
blows
harder
than
at
first
and
there
is
enough
air
to
waft
it
backwards
so
there
will
be
an
opening
at
the
end
i
am
sure
that
is
what
i
must
know
for
certain
all
right
lead
on
i
be
with
you
at
the
death
polly
chuckled
at
eleanor
loyalty
and
crept
on
finally
eleanor
rugged
again
at
her
feet
and
shouted
hey
polly
are
we
most
through
to
china
let
me
know
the
moment
you
get
the
first
peep
at
a
as
i
have
to
brush
the
cobwebs
from
my
chinese
polly
laughed
at
the
girl
who
made
merry
of
a
journey
that
would
have
staggered
an
older
person
finally
however
the
tunnel
widened
so
that
both
girls
could
advance
comfortably
and
then
suddenly
the
flame
of
the
torch
and
the
smoke
ceased
to
blow
into
their
faces
for
they
had
come
out
into
an
open
space
we
here
laughed
polly
trying
to
stand
up
and
giving
her
head
a
smart
rap
against
the
overhanging
rock
here
for
goodness
sake
tell
me
where
cried
eleanor
thrusting
her
torch
ahead
so
that
it
was
almost
snuffed
out
against
polly
shoes
gracious
me
nolla
do
burn
my
soles
cried
polly
managing
to
stand
upright
and
hold
aloft
her
torch
ha
that
good
do
burn
your
soul
teased
eleanor
but
the
moment
the
girls
saw
where
they
were
not
another
word
was
uttered
for
they
found
themselves
in
a
cave
somewhat
smaller
than
the
entrance
cave
but
having
no
fingers
or
outside
opening
the
dome
and
sides
were
rocky
but
everywhere
embedded
in
the
rock
myriad
points
of
light
reflected
as
the
flare
of
the
torch
lit
up
the
place
uncertainly
eleanor
thrust
up
her
torch
also
and
both
girls
pivoted
around
forgetting
about
wild
beasts
and
the
errand
they
came
upon
after
blinking
at
the
bright
yellow
gleams
for
a
time
polly
turned
and
stared
at
eleanor
what
is
it
i
sure
i
do
know
nolla
it
looks
like
copper
polly
if
it
copper
then
we
rich
both
girls
rushed
over
to
examine
the
metallic
gleams
at
close
range
and
polly
frowned
as
a
thought
entered
her
mind
eleanor
turned
and
looked
about
to
be
sure
no
one
could
hear
and
then
whispered
polly
it
looks
like
gold
can
it
be
real
gold
the
girls
stared
at
each
other
and
then
burst
out
into
a
simultaneous
laugh
but
it
was
excitement
not
mirth
that
occasioned
it
before
the
wild
echoes
had
rung
through
the
vault
the
hysterical
girls
were
tearing
at
the
hard
walls
trying
in
vain
to
dislodge
a
nugget
oh
why
did
i
leave
that
ax
in
the
pannier
wailed
polly
is
it
always
that
way
when
you
need
a
thing
exclaimed
eleanor
in
her
haste
to
reach
a
fragment
that
looked
easy
to
break
off
polly
dropped
the
torch
she
stooped
to
pick
it
up
again
and
saw
a
nugget
of
the
ore
on
the
ground
with
dirt
i
got
a
piece
oh
nolla
look
look
shouted
polly
holding
aloft
her
treasure
eleanor
ran
over
and
both
girls
examined
the
chunk
of
yellow
streaked
and
studded
rock
polly
it
really
looks
like
gold
ventured
eleanor
awed
and
it
too
like
old
man
montresor
nuggets
added
polly
at
the
mention
of
the
both
girls
looked
at
each
other
and
the
same
thought
flashed
to
both
of
them
at
once
maybe
it
is
breathed
polly
oh
poll
hold
the
torch
down
near
the
ground
so
i
can
find
a
chunk
wo
you
beseeched
eleanor
now
anxious
to
find
a
nugget
for
herself
there
nolla
see
over
by
the
hole
a
little
piece
for
you
eleanor
ran
over
and
found
it
to
be
smaller
than
the
one
polly
found
but
there
was
more
metal
in
the
nugget
they
examined
it
closely
and
decided
that
the
shining
metal
must
be
gold
i
so
excited
that
i
feel
as
if
wheels
were
turning
all
inside
of
me
do
you
laughed
eleanor
hugging
her
nugget
to
her
heart
it
sort
of
a
dizzy
and
squeamish
feeling
is
it
explained
polly
looking
at
her
companion
then
for
the
first
time
since
they
emerged
from
the
tunnel
she
noticed
the
face
oh
nolla
if
you
could
but
see
yourself
just
like
a
negro
but
streaky
where
you
smudged
the
torch
smoke
from
your
eyes
you
no
blonde
either
poll
laughed
eleanor
rubbing
her
sleeve
across
her
face
and
looking
at
the
soot
in
amusement
but
mine
ca
be
as
black
as
yours
you
got
all
the
smoke
from
both
torches
never
mind
now
if
this
is
gold
we
can
afford
to
have
the
tunnel
and
cave
wired
with
electricity
at
once
laughed
the
excited
girl
well
let
finish
our
hunt
in
the
tunnel
and
then
find
some
more
nuggets
for
anne
and
barbara
they
want
a
share
you
know
suggested
polly
good
gracious
poll
you
not
going
on
are
you
of
course
the
gold
wo
melt
away
but
we
got
to
close
up
any
opening
into
outdoors
you
know
let
go
back
and
tell
the
girls
and
then
finish
the
tunnel
work
pleaded
eleanor
how
silly
to
worm
a
way
back
for
the
sake
of
showing
off
the
no
let
do
this
thing
up
and
then
go
back
to
stay
for
the
night
if
we
do
close
up
any
aperture
a
wild
beast
may
crawl
through
then
what
good
will
the
gold
do
us
if
we
are
dead
sensible
as
ever
even
gold
ca
turn
your
head
said
eleanor
starting
for
the
narrow
place
opposite
the
tunnel
they
came
from
funny
is
it
that
this
cave
should
be
here
just
as
if
it
was
an
inflated
bubble
in
a
tube
said
polly
i
reserve
my
opinion
till
i
see
the
end
of
the
tube
said
eleanor
waiting
for
polly
to
creep
into
the
opening
after
considerable
twisting
and
crawling
polly
first
with
her
torch
and
eleanor
second
they
suddenly
felt
a
current
of
fresh
air
oh
oh
thank
goodness
gasped
polly
i
shoved
the
torch
ahead
have
fallen
headlong
into
this
abyss
what
is
it
poll
a
pit
ever
so
wide
and
i
ca
see
how
deep
it
goes
down
it
right
in
the
tunnel
ground
cutting
off
all
further
investigations
it
cut
off
investigations
of
a
wild
beast
too
wo
it
asked
eleanor
with
relief
in
her
tones
of
course
there
is
a
chance
of
anything
coming
in
this
way
i
can
hear
water
rushing
too
way
down
at
the
bottom
and
the
wind
blows
up
from
this
pit
so
there
must
be
an
opening
down
there
where
the
subterranean
river
rushes
out
maybe
this
tunnel
was
a
river
once
and
emptied
down
into
that
pit
ventured
eleanor
i
do
care
if
it
was
i
anxious
to
go
back
and
eat
now
that
we
know
the
worst
replied
polly
we
wo
need
both
torches
now
poll
so
drop
yours
in
the
pit
and
see
how
deep
it
may
be
suggested
eleanor
all
right
but
for
pity
sake
do
let
yours
go
out
polly
waited
to
steady
the
flame
and
then
dropped
the
torch
it
fell
straight
down
and
flared
up
showing
the
rocky
sides
of
the
pit
then
suddenly
it
in
water
and
all
was
dark
once
more
the
girls
then
wormed
their
way
back
to
the
gold
cave
as
they
termed
it
and
sought
for
nuggets
in
the
dust
and
dirt
of
ages
that
covered
the
rocky
floor
eleanor
found
a
few
pieces
the
size
of
walnuts
and
polly
secured
a
handful
of
small
bits
how
can
we
tie
them
up
if
we
have
to
crawl
back
asked
eleanor
got
a
handkerchief
no
i
gave
it
to
bob
out
of
meanness
laughed
eleanor
hum
well
we
might
put
them
in
our
middy
blouses
only
we
take
a
chance
of
losing
them
in
squirming
back
through
that
tunnel
remarked
polly
i
heard
of
folks
smuggling
things
in
their
shoes
i
have
it
take
off
our
shoes
and
put
the
nuggets
in
then
tie
the
tightly
about
the
top
and
fasten
them
about
our
necks
exclaimed
polly
this
being
a
good
plan
both
girls
soon
had
their
precious
ore
in
their
mountain
boots
and
were
ready
to
proceed
as
the
two
discoverers
neared
the
cave
where
the
others
were
polly
shouted
excitedly
and
eleanor
joined
in
the
clamor
anne
and
barbara
had
become
so
frightened
at
the
prolonged
absence
of
the
two
girls
that
anne
was
about
to
crawl
in
to
find
them
while
barbara
realized
how
much
she
really
loved
her
younger
sister
the
moment
they
heard
the
awful
sounds
issuing
from
the
tunnel
however
they
were
certain
a
wild
beast
had
attacked
them
and
the
victims
were
fighting
a
way
out
anne
grabbed
the
ax
and
held
it
aloft
ready
to
strike
while
barbara
stood
wringing
her
hands
in
despair
by
this
time
polly
stuck
her
head
out
of
the
opening
but
neither
barbara
nor
anne
recognized
the
black
face
her
voice
alone
told
them
it
was
polly
oh
my
dear
child
are
you
badly
hurt
screamed
anne
dropping
the
ax
and
pulling
polly
forth
eleanor
crawling
directly
after
her
gold
gold
gold
see
lots
of
it
mountains
of
it
yelled
eleanor
trying
to
drag
her
nuggets
from
the
boot
without
untying
the
strings
oh
anne
we
found
a
gold
mine
a
great
big
cave
full
of
gold
cried
polly
managing
to
untie
the
strings
poor
children
are
you
daffy
exclaimed
anne
not
sure
whether
to
cry
or
laugh
you
go
daffy
when
you
see
that
cave
all
shining
gold
laughed
eleanor
handing
her
nugget
to
the
curious
sister
see
here
anne
is
this
gold
asked
polly
working
the
large
chunk
of
ore
from
her
shoe
it
looks
like
it
polly
but
i
no
judge
oh
let
crawl
in
and
see
the
cave
now
begged
barbara
eagerly
you
know
you
get
stuck
in
that
narrow
tunnel
bob
besides
starved
said
eleanor
moreover
you
would
go
when
there
seemed
to
be
danger
for
the
girls
and
i
sure
i
not
going
to
try
it
now
added
anne
dear
me
wo
any
one
go
with
me
complained
barbara
who
stooped
to
gaze
in
at
the
tunnel
and
seemed
too
fascinated
to
leave
the
spot
bob
the
gold
has
been
there
for
centuries
and
it
is
likely
to
melt
away
while
we
eat
supper
declared
practical
eleanor
following
anne
to
the
opening
of
the
cave
as
they
went
to
the
place
where
anne
had
spread
the
supper
polly
told
them
of
the
magnificent
sight
when
they
crept
out
of
the
dark
hole
and
saw
the
glimmering
of
the
gold
over
and
over
the
two
girls
had
to
tell
minutest
details
of
the
cavern
barbara
sighing
frequently
to
think
she
was
not
small
enough
to
crawl
in
and
see
for
herself
while
the
two
adventurers
washed
their
faces
and
hands
with
melted
snow
anne
fried
the
fish
over
some
embers
scraped
out
of
the
fire
this
done
they
sat
down
to
eat
as
they
ate
they
talked
continually
of
their
mine
not
so
far
from
the
festive
board
well
polly
you
surely
were
born
with
a
silver
spoon
in
your
mouth
sighed
anne
smilingly
what
makes
you
say
that
you
can
see
for
yourself
ca
you
first
you
fall
into
a
family
that
owns
no
end
of
wealth
in
jeweled
cliffs
and
now
you
fall
into
a
gold
mine
replied
anne
but
nolla
owns
half
of
this
mine
and
i
not
so
sure
but
you
and
bob
come
in
for
your
share
the
other
girls
stared
at
polly
generosity
as
they
had
never
thought
of
holding
any
interest
in
the
mine
anyway
nobody
owns
it
yet
it
legally
belongs
to
the
first
one
who
files
a
claim
so
what
we
must
do
is
to
hurry
back
to
oak
creek
and
register
the
mine
said
barbara
businesslike
my
gold
has
brought
bob
brains
uppermost
teased
eleanor
who
knows
but
this
claim
has
been
staked
years
ago
said
anne
meaningly
polly
and
eleanor
exchanged
glances
but
barbara
wondered
what
do
you
mean
asked
she
well
look
out
in
front
there
a
ledge
cleft
in
the
side
of
the
mountain
wall
between
it
and
the
other
lower
ledge
is
a
canyon
that
might
be
the
one
montresor
found
on
his
yonder
the
slope
meets
the
chasm
and
above
is
the
steep
sides
leading
to
top
notch
trail
could
not
the
have
buried
this
wall
and
then
a
great
have
cleared
it
again
if
we
only
had
a
gushing
mountain
stream
pouring
from
the
the
setting
would
be
complete
barbara
gasped
but
polly
clapped
her
hands
nolla
that
it
the
subterranean
stream
we
found
in
there
some
big
upheaval
changed
its
outlet
or
maybe
this
gold
vein
runs
clean
through
and
claim
is
staked
opposite
this
side
just
where
the
river
pours
out
we
must
look
over
that
side
the
two
younger
girls
then
told
of
the
pit
and
the
river
and
all
agreed
that
it
might
be
the
stream
found
by
the
prospector
before
the
landslide
covered
his
claim
chapter
xv
montresor
claim
is
justified
polly
turned
to
place
the
nuggets
in
the
pannier
and
almost
collided
with
noddy
hello
darling
what
do
you
want
eh
said
she
patting
the
head
noddy
continued
to
gaze
wistfully
at
her
mistress
and
polly
said
anne
did
you
feed
the
burros
and
horses
yes
just
as
you
told
me
to
and
make
the
beds
yes
everything
then
noddy
ambled
over
to
a
pan
of
dirty
snow
water
in
which
the
explorers
had
washed
their
blackened
faces
she
would
have
to
drink
it
if
her
mistress
could
understand
what
she
needed
oh
you
noddy
is
what
you
want
laughed
polly
taking
the
pan
and
running
out
to
the
ledge
to
fill
it
with
clean
snow
this
she
brought
back
and
melted
to
provide
drink
for
the
burro
did
your
thoughtless
forget
a
drink
for
her
little
noddy
crooned
polly
placing
the
pan
for
the
thirsty
burro
after
all
that
hard
climbing
and
too
the
other
girls
laughed
at
the
wise
little
burro
and
her
doting
mistress
but
polly
turned
and
said
it
lucky
noddy
reminded
me
we
must
water
the
horses
well
if
we
want
them
in
good
shape
for
so
eleanor
and
polly
gave
drink
to
the
thirsty
animals
while
anne
took
what
was
supposed
to
be
a
chocolate
cake
from
the
bottom
of
the
pannier
it
had
been
so
shaken
up
during
transit
that
the
paper
felt
sticky
while
they
all
watched
her
open
the
bundle
noddy
went
back
to
her
to
sleep
several
wrappings
of
paper
were
unwound
and
finally
anne
took
forth
the
surprise
sary
had
mentioned
in
the
morning
why
it
a
lemon
custard
pie
of
all
things
cried
barbara
in
the
tin
dish
just
as
it
came
from
the
oven
added
eleanor
laughing
not
quite
like
it
was
when
it
came
from
the
oven
for
such
a
shaken
up
mess
of
meringue
and
custard
we
never
had
at
table
laughed
polly
seeing
the
condition
of
the
pie
from
the
shaking
and
falling
it
had
had
when
choko
went
over
the
cliff
any
one
want
a
slab
asked
anne
laughing
also
no
thanks
maybe
if
i
was
famished
i
eat
the
crust
but
it
does
appeal
to
me
now
said
polly
well
i
say
keep
it
until
we
may
be
glad
to
eat
it
in
the
morning
if
we
are
very
hungry
it
wo
hurt
to
save
it
anyway
said
sensible
eleanor
so
anne
sat
the
down
where
she
was
intending
to
put
it
on
the
ledge
when
she
got
up
from
supper
reckon
i
put
some
more
pine
on
the
fires
said
polly
seeing
the
flames
were
dying
down
she
had
raked
up
and
replenished
one
fire
and
was
attending
to
the
other
when
a
cry
came
from
the
edge
of
the
cliff
causing
polly
to
jump
back
and
clutch
at
anne
arm
mercy
how
that
frightened
me
said
polly
trying
to
laugh
her
fears
away
the
other
girls
were
trembling
too
and
anne
said
it
was
a
wolf
was
it
no
it
was
the
cry
of
a
panther
they
wait
and
wait
in
quiet
for
a
long
time
to
get
a
chance
at
their
prey
then
if
something
interferes
they
make
that
awful
cry
oh
polly
can
he
get
in
do
you
think
wailed
barbara
i
reckon
not
but
were
we
lucky
to
have
all
that
pine
for
the
fires
it
the
best
thing
to
keep
him
away
said
polly
creeping
out
again
to
see
if
both
fires
were
doing
their
duty
another
howl
reached
the
girls
and
eleanor
said
in
a
shaky
voice
he
wo
jump
over
the
fires
will
he
polly
no
smoke
and
sparks
frighten
wild
beasts
from
the
vicinity
they
know
from
instinct
that
forest
fires
kill
and
they
are
wary
of
them
but
they
have
the
sense
to
know
that
a
fire
is
built
on
purpose
to
keep
them
away
it
must
be
awful
late
polly
if
you
think
everything
is
safe
suppose
we
go
to
bed
anne
suggested
after
a
long
interval
unbroken
by
any
howls
all
right
let
bob
and
nolla
take
the
last
two
beds
while
you
and
i
take
these
in
front
i
use
this
one
where
i
can
watch
the
ledge
going
up
to
the
slope
if
i
see
anything
suspicious
i
shoot
said
polly
examining
the
rifle
and
standing
it
by
the
side
of
the
bed
for
comfort
sake
girls
unbutton
your
clothes
and
remove
your
shoes
they
can
be
dried
by
the
fires
so
they
will
feel
better
in
the
morning
advised
anne
the
pine
fires
were
burning
beautifully
and
anne
completely
tired
out
was
soon
asleep
barbara
and
eleanor
had
succumbed
to
weariness
the
moment
they
rolled
over
on
the
beds
but
polly
tired
and
fatigued
too
knew
that
some
one
must
keep
the
fires
going
all
night
so
she
merely
reclined
on
the
bed
and
started
up
at
every
sound
or
crackle
of
the
fires
she
piled
pine
upon
them
all
night
through
until
the
first
faint
gleams
of
dawn
and
then
there
was
no
more
wood
on
hand
to
use
she
worried
over
the
fact
that
the
pine
had
given
out
and
just
as
she
turned
from
the
fires
having
deposited
the
last
small
kindlings
she
had
found
lying
about
she
heard
the
yelping
of
the
and
the
deep
growl
of
a
grizzly
bear
she
ran
and
caught
up
the
rifle
planning
to
shoot
up
at
the
cliff
in
a
venture
to
frighten
them
away
she
aimed
pulled
the
trigger
and
the
rang
out
making
the
echoes
roar
and
roll
through
the
chasm
as
if
an
army
was
shooting
the
three
girls
who
had
been
sleeping
jumped
out
of
the
spruce
beds
and
screamed
with
fright
barbara
ran
madly
over
the
ground
back
and
forth
not
certain
where
to
hide
eleanor
stood
shivering
and
anne
rushed
over
to
ask
polly
what
had
happened
polly
explained
in
a
whisper
and
eleanor
as
in
a
trance
watched
her
sister
running
about
with
something
that
seemed
to
cleave
to
her
foot
closer
than
a
finally
eleanor
came
to
her
senses
and
ran
over
to
keep
barbara
from
rolling
under
the
burros
for
hiding
for
the
love
of
mike
what
all
over
your
foot
cried
eleanor
dragging
barbara
out
from
the
to
exhibit
her
foot
to
the
other
girls
at
sound
of
the
unexpected
shot
barbara
had
jumped
up
frantically
and
darted
hither
and
thither
taking
little
heed
of
where
she
ran
now
as
her
companions
gazed
at
that
foot
exposed
by
eleanor
they
all
laughed
hysterically
while
anne
shouted
oh
our
pie
and
sure
enough
lemon
meringue
clung
tenaciously
to
as
much
of
a
foot
and
lower
limb
as
it
possibly
could
in
spite
of
the
fears
over
wild
animals
the
adventurers
had
to
laugh
at
the
sight
will
i
ever
get
it
off
wailed
barbara
when
she
realized
how
sticky
the
custard
was
rather
ask
shall
we
dispense
with
our
breakfast
retorted
anne
but
another
mad
howl
from
without
now
made
the
horses
cry
and
quiver
with
dread
while
the
girls
blanched
in
fear
polly
had
not
told
them
that
the
wood
was
used
up
and
now
anne
ran
to
carry
an
extra
armful
of
pine
to
replenish
the
fires
when
she
discovered
the
truth
of
the
situation
she
slowly
turned
and
exchanged
a
meaning
look
with
polly
but
polly
now
bent
suddenly
forward
and
intently
eyed
something
she
saw
on
the
verge
of
the
ledge
above
she
kept
her
eyes
focused
there
and
carefully
felt
for
and
caught
up
her
rifle
she
silently
lifted
it
took
aim
and
fired
a
gleam
of
red
and
a
spurt
of
blue
came
from
the
mouth
of
the
gun
even
as
the
sharp
report
cracked
the
echoes
in
the
gully
instantly
following
the
shot
a
wild
howling
as
of
fifty
beasts
fighting
made
polly
shoot
again
snarls
and
yelps
followed
until
polly
heard
the
clamor
grow
fainter
until
all
was
quiet
once
more
well
girls
as
long
as
we
are
fully
awake
suppose
we
forage
for
breakfast
and
make
an
early
start
said
anne
can
we
get
away
do
you
think
polly
asked
eleanor
yes
it
a
clear
morning
and
it
does
take
long
for
the
snow
to
melt
once
it
gets
started
replied
polly
have
you
enough
ammunition
to
load
again
in
case
of
need
questioned
anne
yes
i
always
look
after
that
but
i
was
wondering
what
we
can
have
for
breakfast
ha
leave
that
to
the
cook
laughed
anne
going
to
the
ledge
and
reaching
up
behind
a
crevice
in
the
rocky
wall
she
brought
forth
one
of
the
small
fish
spared
from
the
night
before
good
for
you
anne
if
you
could
only
dig
up
some
sandwiches
as
readily
laughed
polly
maybe
i
can
do
that
too
if
you
will
look
after
the
horses
and
burros
said
anne
taking
a
small
newspaper
bundle
from
behind
her
spruce
bed
when
opened
it
showed
that
anne
had
stolen
some
of
the
oats
from
the
feed
this
she
rolled
between
two
stones
until
it
was
crushed
then
she
told
eleanor
to
pick
out
as
many
of
the
husks
as
possible
she
going
to
give
us
rolled
oats
as
i
live
laughed
eleanor
polly
smiled
for
she
was
surprised
to
find
anne
could
prepare
a
feast
in
the
wilderness
and
soon
the
oatmeal
was
cooking
beside
the
how
can
you
girls
enjoy
that
awful
stuff
without
sugar
or
cream
asked
barbara
plaintively
we
eating
ours
without
a
grumble
but
i
notice
you
are
also
eating
yours
and
doing
all
the
complaining
retorted
eleanor
i
have
to
eat
it
to
keep
from
starving
still
i
ca
enjoy
it
as
you
seem
to
nolla
i
declare
you
seem
to
be
getting
awfully
common
in
your
tastes
huh
show
me
a
selection
of
food
for
breakfast
laughed
eleanor
smacking
her
lips
over
the
last
spoonful
of
oats
what
shall
we
do
about
feeding
the
animals
asked
eleanor
as
they
got
up
from
the
ground
to
pack
up
the
pans
and
other
stuff
waiting
to
be
taken
back
home
we
stop
at
the
first
good
park
and
let
them
graze
for
an
hour
or
two
then
a
good
drink
from
a
stream
will
fix
them
all
right
said
polly
glancing
at
noddy
who
had
come
from
her
stall
and
stood
looking
sleepily
at
the
girls
does
noddy
look
for
all
the
world
like
a
sleepy
child
who
has
to
get
up
for
school
but
who
hates
to
be
disturbed
laughed
anne
as
noddy
tousled
head
bobbed
up
and
down
while
she
sniffed
the
air
redolent
with
oatmeal
satisfied
that
something
was
cooking
for
her
breakfast
noddy
ran
over
and
nozzled
at
the
girls
who
laughed
and
tried
to
push
her
cold
nose
away
the
other
burros
and
horses
came
out
then
and
polly
said
it
makes
me
feel
selfish
to
eat
their
oats
but
then
they
can
eat
grass
in
the
park
and
we
ca
girls
are
you
going
to
have
another
look
at
the
before
you
leave
here
asked
barbara
what
for
it
wo
do
us
any
good
and
only
waste
time
replied
polly
maybe
you
can
find
some
more
nuggets
to
carry
back
ventured
barbara
we
have
all
we
need
to
claim
the
rights
of
the
mine
so
why
lug
any
more
than
we
need
returned
polly
come
on
poll
let
pack
up
and
be
going
said
eleanor
decisively
so
with
the
animals
saddled
and
the
panniers
packed
the
started
carefully
along
the
ledge
towards
the
slope
it
was
an
invigorating
morning
and
the
sun
with
its
rays
was
just
topping
the
tips
of
the
pines
when
the
girls
rode
forth
to
climb
the
slope
not
a
sign
of
that
awful
storm
said
anne
amazed
only
in
the
glades
and
ravines
where
the
snow
has
drifted
into
heaps
even
that
will
melt
rapidly
as
the
warmth
of
the
day
is
felt
said
polly
looking
eagerly
about
as
she
rode
polly
what
do
you
suppose
became
of
those
wild
animals
asked
eleanor
riding
directly
behind
polly
that
is
just
what
i
am
looking
for
i
thought
maybe
i
could
see
some
tracks
for
i
was
sure
i
got
that
panther
when
i
took
aim
and
shot
well
i
going
over
near
that
edge
of
the
cliff
and
see
if
there
is
any
sign
of
blood
or
tracks
declared
eleanor
no
no
you
stop
right
here
with
us
nolla
cried
barbara
anxiously
i
going
over
myself
bob
because
i
am
curious
to
see
why
both
of
them
should
slink
away
so
quickly
a
seldom
leaves
a
possible
victim
until
he
has
been
gorged
and
it
was
strange
that
he
should
go
without
having
tried
to
get
at
us
said
polly
oh
polly
do
talk
of
such
gruesome
things
i
am
so
glad
we
will
soon
be
back
in
civilization
said
barbara
the
horses
reached
the
top
of
the
slope
and
polly
guided
noddy
across
the
rough
place
to
the
cliff
where
the
fight
had
taken
place
here
she
sought
for
some
track
or
sign
of
the
fight
but
saw
only
a
few
small
spots
of
red
in
the
white
snow
eleanor
tried
to
make
her
burro
follow
after
noddy
but
he
was
fractious
and
would
not
go
near
the
cliff
he
made
a
detour
however
about
a
small
group
of
trees
and
just
as
he
came
opposite
them
something
upon
the
at
the
base
of
the
largest
tree
caused
him
to
shy
violently
oh
girls
run
come
here
and
see
what
here
cried
eleanor
excitedly
jumping
from
her
burro
but
remembering
to
hold
the
bridle
the
burro
backed
and
refused
to
go
nearer
the
thing
but
polly
rode
noddy
over
and
saw
that
eleanor
had
discovered
one
of
the
victims
of
the
fight
ha
i
thought
so
said
polly
with
satisfaction
noddy
was
left
to
watch
from
a
comfortable
vantage
point
while
her
mistress
ran
up
to
the
large
panther
which
was
stretched
out
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
he
had
tried
to
climb
it
in
order
to
escape
the
grizzly
claws
is
he
a
massive
beast
cried
anne
watching
from
her
horse
some
distance
away
you
girls
come
back
he
may
not
be
dead
shrieked
barbara
the
moment
she
saw
the
animal
say
bob
if
he
was
dead
he
have
had
me
down
long
before
you
came
along
to
warn
us
laughed
eleanor
polly
he
a
beauty
even
if
he
is
such
a
terror
is
he
said
eleanor
admiring
the
satiny
coat
and
beautiful
form
of
the
large
so
majestic
in
death
i
never
saw
a
larger
one
he
must
be
at
least
nine
feet
long
from
nose
to
tip
of
tail
said
polly
lifting
the
tail
with
her
foot
then
letting
it
drop
again
she
stooped
over
looking
closely
at
the
wounds
made
by
the
grizzly
then
she
suddenly
cried
out
oh
i
thought
that
shot
hit
him
it
must
have
been
that
first
shot
from
the
rifle
that
sent
him
back
from
the
cliff
then
the
bear
tracked
him
and
had
the
fight
back
here
in
the
forest
that
is
when
we
heard
the
sounds
diminishing
well
old
fellow
i
sorry
it
had
to
be
so
but
you
decreed
it
it
was
you
or
one
of
us
and
i
preferred
to
have
had
it
you
old
grizzly
would
be
so
cattish
about
sneaking
up
and
laying
low
for
us
until
the
fire
died
down
or
till
one
of
us
happened
to
step
out
of
the
circle
of
light
he
would
have
made
a
big
noise
from
the
beginning
and
pounced
down
upon
us
and
now
he
has
given
you
yours
as
polly
spoke
she
stood
looking
regretfully
at
the
creature
as
if
she
wished
the
world
was
ordered
otherwise
than
all
the
killing
and
taking
one
from
another
in
the
vain
belief
of
living
polly
how
much
do
you
think
he
weighs
asked
eleanor
eagerly
too
much
to
drag
home
if
that
is
why
you
asked
laughed
polly
looking
up
at
eleanor
with
a
wise
shake
of
the
head
to
tell
the
truth
that
is
exactly
what
i
planned
to
do
until
i
saw
how
big
he
was
laughed
eleanor
he
must
weigh
at
least
two
hundred
pounds
nolla
said
anne
who
had
come
nearer
during
the
examination
yes
nearer
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
i
reckon
said
polly
i
wanted
to
ship
him
to
chicago
and
show
all
of
my
society
friends
what
killed
during
my
mountain
visit
explained
eleanor
your
motive
killed
the
project
before
you
saw
him
said
anne
wagging
her
head
at
eleanor
as
a
rebuke
eleanor
laughed
merrily
well
i
intend
having
a
regular
exhibit
when
i
get
back
all
kinds
of
wild
things
will
be
shown
my
friends
i
propose
having
polly
and
noddy
sitting
upon
a
pedestal
in
the
as
a
sample
of
the
wildest
things
on
the
rockies
laughed
eleanor
giving
polly
an
affectionate
glance
oh
nolla
do
talk
so
foolishly
as
if
polly
would
come
to
chicago
what
would
she
do
with
herself
while
we
had
to
entertain
said
barbara
pettishly
but
no
one
hearkened
maybe
we
can
blaze
a
trail
from
here
to
the
nearest
ranch
on
our
way
home
and
send
some
one
from
there
to
come
and
cart
the
brute
home
for
us
i
pay
him
well
said
eleanor
not
willing
to
forego
the
pleasure
of
showing
the
lion
at
home
oh
but
then
you
will
make
these
ranchers
curious
once
this
far
they
will
look
about
the
place
where
we
spent
the
night
and
that
will
lead
them
to
discover
the
mine
said
polly
i
forgot
that
of
course
it
would
be
foolish
to
give
any
one
the
slightest
clew
to
our
ever
being
here
and
of
what
we
did
while
here
i
see
i
shall
have
to
say
to
the
lion
i
hoped
to
be
lionized
for
said
eleanor
laughingly
with
a
gold
mine
as
rich
as
yours
you
be
lionized
without
the
lion
laughed
anne
by
the
way
did
you
bring
your
nugget
polly
asked
eleanor
reckon
i
did
then
before
we
leave
do
you
think
we
ought
to
make
some
sort
of
a
plan
or
mark
the
spot
so
we
can
find
it
again
we
do
want
to
make
the
same
mistake
old
montresor
did
you
know
said
eleanor
anxiously
i
have
a
plan
all
made
i
did
it
while
sitting
by
the
fire
this
morning
before
you
girls
were
awake
said
polly
taking
off
her
hat
and
removing
a
folded
paper
the
girls
were
surprised
at
the
accuracy
of
the
sketch
and
anne
said
any
one
can
find
it
from
these
directions
thank
you
but
you
see
it
would
be
hazardous
to
risk
any
one
else
coming
here
the
importance
of
keeping
the
whole
adventure
a
profound
secret
until
we
have
duly
filed
papers
and
can
claim
right
of
ownership
to
the
claim
can
be
seen
now
i
hardly
think
it
wise
to
speak
of
the
crevice
or
danger
of
a
until
after
we
get
some
inside
information
about
taking
hold
of
the
mine
said
polly
seriously
an
hour
more
was
used
by
polly
in
staking
a
legal
claim
and
marking
the
corners
with
heaps
of
stone
she
also
left
a
very
deep
blaze
in
each
of
the
four
trees
that
cornered
the
large
square
area
she
thought
would
cover
the
cavern
noddy
soon
found
the
top
notch
trail
when
they
were
again
on
the
way
homeward
by
riding
steadily
all
morning
they
reached
the
spot
where
the
was
waiting
for
transportation
anne
and
the
others
had
experienced
so
many
greater
shocks
since
the
killing
of
the
reptile
that
they
felt
no
qualms
about
carrying
the
snake
now
when
the
four
riders
finally
turned
in
on
the
pebbly
pit
trail
it
was
past
four
they
had
been
going
steadily
since
morning
without
food
or
rest
excepting
the
hour
they
had
to
stop
at
the
falls
to
give
the
animals
grass
and
water
and
the
girls
were
the
lot
as
they
dragged
up
the
road
to
the
house
and
stopped
at
the
porch

sary
rushing
out
of
the
kitchen
door
the
moment
she
heard
the
horses
brewster
heard
sary
and
also
ran
out
crying
oh
my
dear
children
we
had
such
a
day
sam
just
went
to
the
barn
to
hook
up
and
start
the
ranchers
on
a
hunt
a
trapper
rode
in
this
morning
and
spoke
of
the
awful
blizzard
that
hit
top
notch
trail
of
course
we
knew
you
could
find
or
we
have
been
still
more
worried
the
girls
looked
at
each
other
and
laughed
aloud
brewster
shrewdly
guessed
the
truth
you
find
it
and
where
under
the
sun
did
you
hide
during
that
awful
storm
cried
she
anxiously
sary
paid
no
attention
to
a
recital
of
trails
and
storms
however
for
it
was
half
past
four
and
jeb
would
have
to
take
care
of
the
five
mounts
before
he
could
hope
to
come
in
for
supper
and
spend
a
quiet
evening
with
her
so
to
prevent
any
delay
she
turned
to
polly
to
be
tuckered
out
jest
flop
inter
the
cheers
an
rest
whiles
ah
carry
the
hosses
to
th
barn
ah
tell
brewster
come
home
an
spared
him
a
trip
brewster
objected
to
the
offer
for
she
wanted
sary
to
finish
the
preparations
for
supper
and
give
her
time
to
talk
with
the
girls
sary
however
paid
no
attention
to
her
mistress
objections
but
gathered
all
the
reins
together
and
led
the
animals
to
the
barn
shortly
after
the
girls
had
gone
indoors
to
drink
some
hot
milk
for
brewster
said
hot
milk
would
take
most
of
the
fatigue
out
of
their
bodies
sam
brewster
ran
down
the
path
from
the
barn
and
burst
into
the
well
say
ah
shore
am
glad
to
see
back
home
ah
just
was
preparing
to
wire
some
detectives
to
be
on
the
lookout
in
the
zoo
for
any
lions
or
bears
lately
come
in
who
looked
unusually
every
one
was
so
delighted
at
the
reunion
that
foolishness
made
them
laugh
merrily
he
hugged
polly
until
she
cried
for
breath
then
he
shook
hands
over
and
over
again
with
anne
and
the
girls
brewster
remonstrating
meantime
that
she
wanted
to
hear
of
their
adventures
the
girls
were
so
eager
to
tell
about
the
cavern
of
gold
that
they
refused
to
wash
and
dress
or
remove
any
stains
of
the
climb
until
after
the
whole
story
was
told
and
brewster
thought
it
was
the
tale
of
the
trip
and
the
trials
throughout
the
blizzard
and
they
cared
little
for
what
had
passed
as
long
as
all
were
safe
and
happy
again
but
polly
blurted
out
the
truth
to
make
them
listen
i
found
montresor
gold
mine
paw
it
hit
the
mark
in
the
shock
the
news
made
upon
the
brewsters
no
one
noticed
polly
slip
on
the
old
pet
title
after
a
long
tense
period
of
silence
however
sam
brewster
said
daughter
it
ca
be
true
is
though
brewster
polly
and
i
crawled
through
the
tunnel
until
we
came
out
into
that
marvelous
cavern
of
gold
and
eleanor
sighed
audibly
as
she
thought
of
that
sight
what
cavern
must
be
clean
locoed
with
the
blizzard
and
the
long
ride
cried
brewster
testily
the
girls
laughed
appreciatively
for
they
understood
just
how
those
who
remained
at
home
would
feel
at
such
news
so
polly
sat
upon
her
father
knee
and
told
him
the
story
of
the
mine
from
the
time
choko
fell
over
the
cliff
until
they
left
the
panther
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
and
here
the
plan
and
claim
and
there
the
gold
polly
drew
the
nuggets
from
her
dress
and
took
the
papers
from
her
sombrero
and
placed
them
in
her
father
hands
brewster
dropped
upon
her
knees
to
the
floor
to
look
at
the
map
and
the
ore
while
her
husband
was
examining
the
large
nugget
the
four
girls
had
no
idea
how
anxious
they
were
about
this
ore
until
they
saw
brewster
carefully
looking
it
over
with
the
eye
of
an
expert
miner
his
first
words
were
a
decided
shock
ah
would
set
much
store
about
this
mine
girls
do
see
what
ah
see
in
this
discovery
it
gold
yes
it
looks
to
me
like
of
good
quality
and
if
it
is
as
you
say
a
cavern
exposed
so
any
one
can
value
it
so
much
the
better
but
the
end
of
top
notch
trail
where
you
doubtless
spent
the
night
is
a
far
haul
from
oak
creek
and
the
chasm
in
front
and
the
mountain
on
top
are
drawbacks
to
mining
however
we
will
ride
into
oak
creek
in
the
morning
and
file
this
claim
of
yours
and
see
if
it
comes
anywhere
near
to
being
the
one
old
montresor
left
polly
it
would
give
me
the
keenest
joy
to
be
able
to
say
something
to
a
few
of
the
mean
old
rascals
about
oak
creek
who
called
me
a
fool
for
paying
the
funeral
costs
and
filing
the
claim
of
that
kind
old
man
montresor
but
dad
father
if
this
mine
happens
to
cross
the
claim
staked
by
montresor
will
it
interfere
with
our
filing
a
new
claim
asked
polly
anxiously
it
depends
on
how
much
ground
you
covered
with
your
corners
replied
her
father
you
can
depend
upon
it
i
covered
all
i
could
think
might
come
within
a
mile
of
gold
laughed
polly
well
girls
listen
to
some
good
advice
on
this
not
a
word
to
be
said
about
this
cave
not
even
among
yourselves
until
the
claim
is
filed
and
investigated
you
see
the
walls
have
ears
when
any
one
speaks
of
gold
then
having
attended
to
the
legal
aspects
of
the
mine
we
will
all
ride
over
to
remain
a
few
days
as
visitors
to
old
grizzly
when
we
get
back
we
ought
to
have
some
information
worth
while
and
what
about
sending
for
john
friend
to
come
and
go
with
us
if
he
knew
enough
to
tell
you
about
the
lava
he
will
surely
be
able
to
judge
about
the
gold
ventured
polly
eagerly
i
think
that
is
a
splendid
idea
sam
when
we
go
in
to
oak
creek
let
us
send
john
a
explaining
about
this
cavern
added
brewster
hai
comin
to
supper
har
hev
ah
ben
and
wukked
all
day
hopin
fer
a
night
off
said
sary
suddenly
appearing
at
the
doorway
between
the
and
the
kitchen
every
one
started
for
she
had
not
made
a
sound
before
speaking
so
no
one
knew
how
much
she
had
brewster
quickly
replied
however
why
sary
i
did
know
you
wished
to
go
out
i
could
have
attended
to
supper
myself
had
you
asked
me
ah
hai
planned
to
go
out
ah
said
a
off
mis
brewster
said
sary
hardly
deigning
to
wait
for
an
answer
but
looking
at
the
girls
with
an
impatient
frown
mother
we
really
must
wash
before
supper
said
polly
sary
tossed
her
head
brewster
knew
what
that
meant
so
she
urged
the
girls
to
forego
any
lengthy
toilets
and
merely
wash
away
the
worst
signs
of
travel
sary
was
pacified
when
eleanor
came
out
of
the
room
and
handed
her
a
large
paper
bundle
sary
i
have
a
little
present
for
you
because
we
made
so
much
trouble
oh
miss
nolla
ah
much
obleeged
t
ah
don
mind
trouble
onny
yoh
see
ah
expec
it
took
sary
but
an
instant
to
open
the
package
and
when
she
beheld
a
ruffled
organdy
dress
discarded
by
barbara
the
previous
season
and
accidentally
packed
in
the
trunk
with
other
clothes
she
rolled
her
eyes
heavenward
miss
nolla
is
this
fine
gown
fer
me
eleanor
stifled
a
laugh
but
sary
made
as
if
she
would
clasp
the
girl
in
her
powerful
arms
so
discretion
was
needed
eleanor
backed
behind
the
kitchen
chair
miss
nolla
ah
wonder
ef
a
widder
of
seven
months
standin
mought
wear
little
yaller
on
a
dress
this
is
certainly
sary
came
from
brewster
who
now
joined
the
two
it
not
the
color
or
quantity
of
clothes
as
much
as
the
sincerity
of
one
mourning
quite
unintentionally
brewster
touched
upon
a
tender
spot
in
fact
so
tender
was
it
that
sary
blamed
bill
for
having
died
so
recently
instead
of
two
years
back
she
might
have
now
been
ending
her
second
year
of
mourning
eleanor
being
trained
to
the
wiles
of
polite
society
saw
and
understood
sary
flash
of
resentment
so
she
turned
to
brewster
with
the
remark
i
heard
said
that
the
highest
regard
a
widow
can
pay
her
departed
is
to
take
a
second
husband
it
speaks
well
for
her
happiness
with
the
first
one
you
see
brewster
stared
at
eleanor
but
sary
smirked
and
quickly
replied
is
right
miss
nolla
a
widder
what
hez
ben
happy
that
she
gits
lonesome
whiles
thinkin
of
her
departed
hez
a
right
t
find
a
second
husban
brewster
choked
a
laugh
as
she
saw
the
sublime
look
in
the
eyes
and
hurried
out
eleanor
then
suggested
now
you
run
away
and
beautify
yourself
sary
and
i
will
wash
the
dishes
sary
needed
no
second
invitation
and
in
another
moment
she
had
disappeared
to
her
boudoir
back
of
the
buttery
eleanor
was
as
good
as
her
word
for
she
was
soon
busy
with
and
mop
rattling
the
china
and
banging
pans
about
as
if
noise
and
bustle
were
sure
signs
of
hard
work
and
energy
polly
laughed
as
she
cleared
away
the
remains
of
the
meal
and
then
caught
up
a
towel
to
dry
the
dishes
as
they
worked
the
two
girls
talked
poll
now
that
you
have
this
gold
mine
what
will
you
do
with
all
the
wealth
that
is
yours
asked
eleanor
polly
held
a
decorated
plate
in
front
of
her
face
to
hide
her
smile
and
pretended
to
be
looking
for
grease
on
its
surface
when
she
had
straightened
her
face
again
she
said
oh
i
going
away
to
school
first
of
all
i
not
so
sure
that
i
want
to
stay
in
denver
now
that
you
have
told
me
all
about
chicago
i
write
for
catalogues
of
schools
there
and
then
i
can
see
john
quite
often
during
the
school
year
just
what
i
would
have
suggested
poll
then
you
can
live
at
home
with
me
dad
and
you
and
i
will
have
the
best
times
to
accentuate
her
approval
of
polly
premature
plans
eleanor
swished
the
wildly
up
and
down
in
the
soapy
water
but
the
suds
flew
up
lightly
as
soapsuds
will
and
a
bubble
burst
in
polly
eye
stop
throwing
dish
water
in
my
face
nolla
cried
polly
with
eyes
screwed
shut
and
one
free
hand
trying
to
rub
the
smarting
lye
from
her
eye
i
never
did
polly
it
must
have
splashed
accidentally
when
i
was
washing
the
pan
you
have
done
nothing
since
you
began
the
dishes
but
rattle
and
swash
that
mop
about
in
the
pan
as
if
you
were
mining
the
ore
from
the
cave
complained
polly
as
she
managed
to
open
her
eyes
again
i
suppose
it
is
because
we
are
so
excited
over
the
find
and
all
it
means
for
you
polly
explained
eleanor
contritely
it
does
mean
much
more
now
than
before
the
thing
i
am
most
happy
over
is
that
old
man
montresor
will
be
vindicated
and
people
will
stop
jeering
at
me
and
at
what
they
called
his
locoed
ideas
the
conversation
was
interrupted
at
this
moment
by
the
appearance
of
sary
she
first
poked
her
head
from
the
partly
opened
door
of
her
room
and
then
said
is
any
one
about
to
see
me
polly
turned
to
make
sure
that
they
were
alone
in
the
kitchen
and
eleanor
replied
no
what
is
it
sary
then
the
maid
stepped
forth
and
such
a
vision
she
had
curled
her
red
hair
on
a
pair
of
tongs
the
curling
irons
were
but
a
quarter
of
an
inch
in
diameter
and
they
were
heated
by
thrusting
them
into
the
living
embers
of
the
kitchen
fire
when
sary
drew
the
comb
through
her
scanty
tresses
they
took
on
the
appearance
of
cotton
threads
which
had
just
been
ripped
out
of
an
old
garment
so
crinkly
and
frizzed
were
the
strands
of
hair
the
flowered
organdy
dress
that
eleanor
had
given
sary
to
wear
for
the
great
occasion
of
receiving
a
caller
was
much
too
small
for
the
buxom
widow
and
she
was
in
great
distress
about
it
this
brought
her
out
to
ask
advice
of
the
girls
why
bother
to
wear
the
dress
sary
until
you
have
had
time
to
alter
it
for
yourself
asked
polly
why
polly
ah
has
to
keep
up
my
looks
now
that
is
lookin
my
way
again
ef
had
such
fine
city
gals
at
home
what
wears
th
latest
fashions
so
that
jeb
ca
help
but
see
what
what
ah
woulden
have
to
worry
so
much
about
looks
but
a
woman
has
to
keep
up
when
other
women
set
the
pace
ef
she
is
a
widow
ah
am
now
eleanor
laughed
appreciatively
and
said
sary
is
just
like
bob
when
it
comes
to
that
it
is
the
eternal
feminine
poll
that
drives
both
bob
and
sary
to
the
verge
of
tears
because
they
can
not
catch
their
beaux
with
their
good
looks
sary
smirked
at
eleanor
words
for
she
thought
she
was
being
coupled
with
barbara
and
her
attractions
sary
felt
quite
sure
that
she
was
and
winsome
but
she
had
to
hear
eleanor
words
to
make
her
believe
she
was
fascinating
if
i
was
sary
i
wear
a
nice
clean
blouse
and
a
linen
skirt
it
would
be
far
more
comfortable
than
that
awfully
tight
gown
remarked
polly
but
the
help
scorned
such
simplicity
and
turned
to
eleanor
for
further
advice
about
her
appearance
the
latter
wise
in
her
years
turned
her
head
on
one
side
and
appeared
to
be
debating
seems
to
me
sary
that
putting
on
that
organdy
just
as
it
is
without
fixing
it
over
a
bit
may
make
jeb
suspicious
of
its
not
being
made
for
you
he
may
even
go
so
far
as
to
wonder
if
bob
handed
it
down
to
you
now
you
do
not
want
him
to
dream
that
you
did
not
have
it
made
to
order
for
yourself
so
why
not
take
it
off
until
you
can
remodel
it
to
fit
yourself
like
new
sary
pondered
this
suggestion
for
a
few
moments
and
then
said
ah
ai
got
no
fancy
dress
to
wear
onny
this
miss
nolla
ef
ah
puts
on
my
black
alpaky
he
remember
bill
and
sech
memories
allus
dampen
a
man
plans
to
pop
th
question
both
girls
had
to
laugh
outright
at
the
unexpected
confession
but
sary
was
in
a
serious
frame
of
mind
and
paid
no
attention
to
their
merriment
she
resumed
her
interrupted
explanation
it
jest
this
way
in
oak
crick
country
see
single
men
ai
growin
on
every
bush
and
a
widder
has
a
hard
time
of
it
anyway
when
most
ranchers
dawters
are
waitin
to
snap
up
a
likely
catch
jeb
a
catch
ah
says

a
gallavantin
dude

his
wages

being
right
on
th
spot
when
a
man
willin
to
be
cotched

half
the
fight
to
hook
him
ah

afford
to
snap
mah
fingers
at
all

crick
tryin
their
bestes
to
make
jeb
wink
his
eye
at
jus
because
ah
whar
ah
am
keepin
tabs
on
him
all
his
time
when
the
laughter
caused
by
these
words
had
subsided
somewhat
the
two
girls
replied
polly
to
advise
and
eleanor
to
make
a
giggling
explanation
eleanor
said
you
make
a
wonderfully
accurate
on
comings
and
goings
sary
and
polly
advised
you
run
back
to
your
room
sary
and
put
on
a
sensible
dress
to
keep
jeb
from
wondering
how
much
of
his
earnings
it
would
take
to
dress
you
in
fine
clothes
like
that
organdy
gown
cost
thar
somethin
in
that
too
polly
ah
reckon
you
right
so
throw
on
that
striped
your
maw
gave
me
and
the
duck
skirt
with
the
tucks
in
it
sary
vanished
as
quickly
as
she
had
appeared
and
the
two
girls
stood
laughing
as
they
saw
the
door
close
then
they
dried
the
hung
up
the
towels
and
mop
and
turned
to
go
back
to
the
where
sam
brewster
and
his
wife
were
planning
for
the
ride
to
oak
creek
on
the
next
day
and
the
trip
up
to
the
cave
on
the
day
following
that
but
the
girls
had
not
reached
the
door
before
a
hist
halted
them
they
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
and
saw
small
head
at
the
kitchen
door
when
he
saw
that
he
had
gained
their
attention
he
beckoned
furtively
with
a
horny
index
finger
both
girls
over
to
hear
what
news
he
had
to
impart
for
his
behavior
denoted
some
dread
secret
is
sary
dodd
hangin
he
whispered
anxiously
she
in
her
room
getting
ready
for
company
was
eleanor
amused
reply
wall
kin
do
me
a
big
favor
ef
explain
ah

too
sick
to
come
in
she
tol
me
ah
jus
had
to
call
on
her
but
ah
ai
got
courage
ah
kin
see
jus
whar
all
this
callin
and
sittin
alone
of
evenin
is
goin
to
land
me
sary
got
a
powerful
way
for
a
woman
and
ah
ai
no
marryin
man
am
ah
polly
jeb
plaintive
tone
and
his
beseeching
eyes
convulsed
eleanor
with
the
desire
to
laugh
but
polly
saw
how
serious
he
was
in
his
fear
of
being
caught
by
a
woman
wiles
and
she
replied
no
jeb
you
are
not
a
marrying
man
i
can
say
that
much
and
sary
ought
to
know
better
than
to
lure
you
on
with
all
her
past
experiences
of
mankind
polly
earnest
explanation
made
eleanor
lose
control
of
herself
and
she
sat
down
in
a
kitchen
chair
and
laughed
so
heartily
that
sary
hurried
forth
jeb
instantly
ducked
and
tried
to
lose
himself
in
the
dense
darkness
of
the
but
sary
was
too
quick
for
him
she
darted
to
the
door
called
him
with
an
imperative
voice
and
brought
the
recreant
back
to
his
duty
of
calling
then
she
turned
to
the
two
girls
and
said
calmly
but
with
meaning
much
obliged
fer
th
ah
see
that
the
kitchen
is
set
to
rights
fer
the
evenin
with
this
dismissal
polly
and
eleanor
had
to
go
and
laughing
still
they
went
through
the
door
to
join
the
others
who
sat
about
the
round
table
figuring
and
planning
sary
very
quietly
closed
the
door
between
the
two
rooms
and
eleanor
whispered
to
polly
poor
jeb
we
had
to
leave
him
to
his
fate
after
all
by
six
the
next
morning
the
riders
were
on
the
way
to
oak
creek
polly
and
eleanor
rode
side
by
side
and
discussed
a
good
name
for
the
claim
after
suggesting
and
rejecting
many
fine
sounding
names
polly
finally
chuckled
gleefully
you
thought
of
one
declared
eleanor
yes
just
the
thing
wo
find
suit
it
great
and
it
was
little
choko
that
found
it
too
if
he
had
fallen
over
the
cliff
we
never
would
have
discovered
the
cave
and
the
rest
of
it
we
call
it
that
find
say
everybody
listen
to
this
the
mine
is
going
to
be
called
find
do
you
like
it
called
polly
to
the
other
riders
very
appropriate
was
the
answer
so
choko
find
was
its
name
reaching
oak
creek
the
party
rode
to
simm
office
and
brewster
told
the
story
in
detail
the
attorney
was
completely
silenced
at
the
strangeness
of
the
adventure
but
demanded
proof
in
seeing
the
ore
before
he
would
credit
the
tale
well
ah
declare
if
this
is
the
derndest
thing
ah
ever
heard
of
in
my
life
exclaimed
simms
as
he
examined
the
nuggets
simms
do
you
remember
montresor
nuggets
and
legacy
asked
brewster
the
lawyer
looked
quickly
up
at
his
questioner
and
a
look
of
understanding
crept
into
his
eyes
sam
ah
reckon
it
is
the
same
the
ledge
the
canyon
the
trails
the
river
added
brewster
convincingly
just
wait
here
till
ah
get
my
papers
from
the
bank
vault
excitedly
cried
the
lawyer
snatching
his
cap
and
running
out
of
the
office
simms
keeps
his
valuable
papers
in
the
masoned
safe
at
the
bank
you
know
if
the
town
burns
down
during
a
miners
celebration
some
night
his
papers
will
be
safe
anyway
explained
brewster
the
lawyer
soon
returned
with
a
package
held
closely
under
his
arm
he
sat
down
and
opened
the
papers
before
his
visitors
here
th
rough
plan
of
the
claim
and
here
montresor
letter
that
was
found
after
he
was
buried
you
know
sam
what
letter
is
that
father
wondered
polly
we
never
told
you
about
it
as
it
would
have
helped
any
one
then
but
now
you
shall
read
it
where
was
it
found
in
the
pocket
of
an
old
hunting
coat
when
we
tried
to
find
some
clew
to
his
family
and
home
address
but
the
top
of
the
letter
had
been
torn
away
so
we
never
knew
for
whom
it
was
meant
polly
took
the
closely
written
sheet
and
read
the
letter
penned
by
her
old
friend
on
the
mountains
at
last
i
can
say
to
you
all
that
my
education
was
not
wasted
as
you
claimed
i
have
made
good
i
am
a
rich
rich
man
as
i
write
these
words
i
have
discovered
a
gold
mine
that
will
prove
to
be
worth
millions
i
refrained
from
writing
as
you
had
requested
until
i
had
news
now
i
can
write
in
the
years
i
have
spent
on
these
mountains
i
felt
sure
i
would
strike
gold
as
every
sign
in
rock
and
sand
formation
of
the
sides
of
the
peaks
are
favorable
to
gold
deposits
i
proved
my
mining
education
to
be
of
some
worth
for
it
helped
to
guide
me
to
a
ledge
where
the
is
so
rich
that
it
seems
to
run
deep
into
the
rocks
yet
quite
easy
to
mine
i
had
great
difficulty
in
reaching
the
place
and
afterwards
when
darkness
fell
over
the
place
i
had
to
trust
to
the
horse
to
find
a
spot
to
camp
i
left
my
claims
staked
out
and
marked
as
we
used
to
do
in
the
klondike
and
morning
i
shall
ride
directly
to
oak
creek
to
file
the
papers
and
have
an
assay
on
the
ore
i
am
now
writing
by
the
light
of
the
with
grizzlies
prowling
about
and
panthers
howling
to
get
at
me
and
the
horse
but
my
ring
of
fire
is
security
for
us
i
have
the
slightest
idea
of
where
this
camp
is
but
i
will
scout
around
in
the
morning
and
then
write
you
again
after
i
return
from
my
trip
to
oak
creek
you
must
understand
how
happy
i
am
to
be
able
to
pay
off
my
obligations
and
take
my
rightful
place
in
the
world
with
my
family
god
grant
that
this
blessing
of
wealth
bestowed
upon
me
after
all
these
years
of
separation
and
disgrace
charged
against
me
who
am
innocent
will
be
the
last
of
my
sufferings
i
have
never
heard
from
the
traitorous
friend
who
caused
me
this
ruin
and
now
it
matters
little
polly
looked
up
at
this
point
and
said
he
must
have
finished
this
after
the
daddy
yes
daughter
read
on
and
you
will
see
replied
brewster
gently
the
curse
still
pursues
me
i
have
not
written
to
conclude
this
letter
since
the
night
i
started
it
as
hard
luck
again
is
my
lot
i
filed
the
claim
and
showed
the
ore
but
different
laws
prevail
in
colorado
and
i
found
i
must
register
the
nearest
survey
corners
and
sections
to
my
mine
to
obtain
a
legal
ownership
however
my
plans
and
specifications
were
sufficient
to
protect
me
from
that
afternoon
a
storm
came
over
the
mountains
and
lasted
three
days
it
blew
and
poured
and
snowed
until
it
seemed
as
if
all
the
furies
in
hades
were
let
loose
then
it
cleared
again
and
i
started
out
with
my
dog
and
horse
to
visit
my
mine
and
make
satisfactory
corners
and
plans
for
filing
a
great
had
occurred
during
that
storm
and
the
entire
was
changed
canyons
cliffs
and
mine
are
gone
wiped
away
as
if
they
had
never
existed
of
course
i
know
the
gold
is
still
there
but
buried
under
tons
of
earth
and
trash
it
will
take
longer
and
cost
more
to
unearth
that
is
all
but
i
will
have
to
locate
the
place
anew
as
i
have
no
bearings
to
work
from
so
i
propose
starting
from
top
notch
trail
and
have
patsy
help
me
find
it
on
the
as
near
as
i
can
remember
from
the
of
that
night
where
i
first
wrote
this
letter
i
am
reserving
this
until
i
find
the
mine
then
i
will
mail
it
at
once
now
that
i
have
definite
grounds
to
work
on
my
enthusiasm
is
equal
to
carry
me
through
any
difficulties
in
my
pathway
oh
father
how
sad
wept
polly
handing
the
letter
to
anne
to
read
to
the
other
two
girls
we
know
the
rest
polly
and
that
is
why
we
never
had
you
read
this
now
that
we
can
prove
the
poor
old
man
was
sane
we
will
try
to
establish
his
reputation
for
all
concerned
said
brewster
why
did
you
try
to
find
his
family
when
he
died
asked
polly
frowning
at
what
she
considered
an
oversight
we
did
every
newspaper
of
reputation
carried
an
advertisement
but
ah
think
now
that
the
old
man
assumed
another
name
than
his
rightful
one
that
is
why
we
never
had
a
reply
to
our
ads
replied
simms
eleanor
was
elated
at
the
romance
of
this
experience
and
turned
to
polly
exclaiming
oh
poll
we
meet
montresor
son
some
day
and
you
fall
in
love
with
him
without
knowing
who
he
is
then
it
will
all
come
out
when
he
visits
your
parents
to
ask
for
you
and
he
will
get
his
share
of
the
mine
anyway
anne
laughed
heartily
at
such
nonsense
but
polly
rather
favored
such
an
ending
so
her
mother
and
father
quickly
interrupted
the
romance
by
saying
come
come
sign
papers
and
wind
up
this
affair
simms
said
the
assay
was
more
than
satisfactory
and
choko
find
was
filed
as
the
discovery
of
marybelle
brewster
daughter
of
sam
and
mary
brewster
of
pebbly
pit
who
marybelle
brewster
wondered
eleanor
surprised
it
me
but
no
one
knows
it
laughed
polly
sam
when
do
you
reckon
ought
to
go
back
to
the
mine
and
investigate
said
simms
plan
to
ride
there
early
in
the
morning
will
try
to
come
with
us
ah
like
it
ah
have
had
my
regular
fishing
trip
this
year
and
this
will
answer
replied
simms
eagerly
then
be
shore
to
meet
us
at
seven
or
eight
at
the
pine
tree
just
by
the
corduroy
roadway
said
brewster
sam
better
get
away
before
that
we
wo
be
the
only
riders
along
top
notch
trail
the
moment
this
gets
wind
warned
simms
he
right
sam
let
start
from
the
farm
at
and
meet
simms
at
five
or
six
advised
brewster
right
make
it
six
simms
and
see
if
the
coroner
and
sheriff
want
an
outing
brewster
voice
sounded
interesting
just
as
the
lawyer
opened
the
door
for
the
ladies
to
leave
a
handsome
young
man
of
about
eighteen
came
down
the
road
it
was
evident
in
every
way
that
he
was
a
tenderfoot
newly
arrived
probably
just
came
in
on
the
noon
local
from
denver
i
looking
for
carew
camp
sir
that
cowboy
over
at
the
said
you
might
tell
me
how
to
reach
it
oh
that
the
surveyin
crew
for
the
government
ah
reckon
have
quite
a
jaunt
afore
night
to
reach
there
they
working
about
twenty
mile
from
here
up
on
the
yellow
jacket
pass
road
replied
simms
studying
the
surprised
face
closely
ah
saw
carew
driver
stopping
at
jake
when
we
drove
by
simms
said
brewster
at
this
moment
if
can
find
jake
that
will
be
the
way
to
arrive
take
a
reserved
seat
beside
him
chuckled
simms
the
youth
was
shy
before
so
many
pretty
girls
so
he
took
off
his
cap
to
acknowledge
the
obligation
and
would
have
backed
away
had
not
simms
asked
a
very
strange
question
young
man
you
look
exactly
like
an
old
friend
i
knew
in
these
parts
some
years
back
so
like
that
i
must
ask
you
your
name
the
stranger
flushed
and
stammered
i
am
kenneth
evans
from
new
york
simms
frowned
when
he
heard
the
name
and
turned
to
sam
brewster
did
you
ever
see
anything
to
beat
that
likeness
to
the
man
we
were
just
talking
about
polly
had
noticed
the
resemblance
as
did
her
father
but
nothing
more
was
said
at
that
time
as
so
much
remained
to
be
attended
to
before
the
ride
on
the
morrow
well
boy
be
sure
to
drop
in
and
have
a
talk
with
me
the
next
time
you
are
in
town
my
friend
was
from
your
way
too
and
who
knows
but
can
hook
up
a
relationship
eh
said
simms
holding
out
his
hand
to
young
evans
i
be
glad
to
do
that
responded
kenneth
heartily
brewster
kindly
heart
was
touched
by
the
utter
forlornness
expressed
in
the
youth
face
when
he
heard
how
far
away
the
camp
was
located
so
she
addressed
him
directly
did
you
want
to
reach
carew
or
can
you
come
home
with
us
and
get
a
fresh
start
for
camp
in
the
morning
i
was
supposed
to
report
to
carew
yesterday
but
i
lost
the
train
at
chicago
and
that
made
me
late
all
along
the
line
of
explained
young
evans
smiling
more
cheerfully
i
thank
you
just
the
same
for
inviting
me
to
join
your
circle
but
i
really
feel
that
i
must
find
this
man
jake
and
get
away
well
young
man
now
abetted
brewster
do
as
you
think
best
but
that
wo
prevent
you
from
riding
over
to
pebbly
pit
any
day
you
can
get
away
from
work
and
having
dinner
with
us
the
young
man
was
surprised
at
such
hearty
hospitality
shown
an
utter
stranger
but
he
had
heard
of
western
generosity
and
he
now
felt
that
he
had
met
such
types
of
westerners
just
now
simms
called
out
quickly
there
goes
jake
hey
ah
say
the
man
called
jake
halted
as
he
was
crossing
the
muddy
road
and
looked
towards
the
group
which
stood
in
front
of
simms
office
simms
waved
his
hat
to
denote
that
he
was
wanted
so
the
driver
turned
and
slouched
along
the
side
of
the
road
until
he
was
within
a
few
feet
of
the
lawyer
before
the
latter
explained
got
a
fine
young
tenderfoot
here
for
you
jake
and
ah
just
wanted
to
warn
you
to
handle
him
with
care
or
these
pretty
gals
of
pebbly
pit
will
call
you
to
account
for
him
boys
are
scarcer
than
hen
teeth
since
the
war
you
know
and
our
gals
are
having
a
hard
time
raking
the
country
to
find
such
a
swain
as
young
evans
simms
frivolous
talk
made
the
girls
smile
and
kenneth
evans
began
to
feel
more
at
ease
but
jake
was
replying
to
the
explanation
and
he
listened
to
what
was
said
ah
come
all
the
way
from
camp
yistiddy
and
no
kid
to
be
seen
then
the
boss
sent
me
back
to
meet
this
local
train
but
he
ai
come
yet
when
he
shows
up
he
can
walk
to
carew
camp
fur
all
i
care
i
going
back
right
off
lookin
for
a
kid
eh
what
sort
of
one
is
he
teased
simms
augh
jim
latimer
says
he
was
him
but
a
blondy
and
he
said
he
looked
a
tenderfoot
all
through
i
asked
red
mike
if
a
feller
stopped
at
his
eatin
place
for
a
snack
but
mike
tole
me
he
ai
seen
no
stranger
in
oak
crick
this
week
jake
grumbled
did
you
say
jim
latimer
exclaimed
eleanor
eagerly
jake
turned
to
stare
at
the
girl
and
young
evans
brightened
visibly
then
he
said
do
you
know
jim
do
you
know
him
chorused
several
voices
polly
and
her
parents
joining
the
chorus
do
i
know
jim
repeated
kenneth
laughing
like
his
old
merry
self
i
should
say
i
did
why
jim
and
i
went
through
school
together
back
east
and
it
jim
who
got
me
in
this
crew
so
i
can
get
experience
and
money
at
the
same
time
well
this
is
great
exclaimed
sam
brewster
you
see
my
boy
john
goes
to
college
with
tom
latimer
at
chicago
and
that
how
we
met
jim
his
brother
gave
him
a
letter
of
introduction
to
bring
us
when
he
came
out
here
to
work
with
carew
i
knew
the
boss
of
the
survey
crew
and
jim
has
been
over
to
pebbly
pit
on
sundays
so
now
you
must
get
him
to
show
you
the
way
this
happy
discovery
of
having
a
mutual
friend
completed
feeling
of
ease
and
confidence
and
he
was
soon
talking
unrestrainedly
about
the
latimers
what
splendid
people
they
were
how
jim
father
was
trying
to
save
his
ken
father
from
having
a
very
valuable
patent
stolen
by
a
ring
of
rascals
in
new
york
city
and
how
latimer
brother
who
was
a
large
financier
on
wall
street
was
financing
the
lawsuit
and
the
that
was
formed
on
the
value
of
the
patent
during
the
time
it
took
for
kenneth
to
enlarge
on
the
merits
of
the
latimers
jake
grew
restless
he
shifted
his
weight
from
one
cowhide
booted
leg
to
the
other
and
finally
he
heaved
a
doleful
sigh
then
he
drew
attention
to
himself
ef
ai
goin
to
get
started
mighty
soon
thar
no
use
in
gettin
off
mike
has
a
dance
to
his
ristrant
at
night
on
and
he
can
put
us
up
all
right
brewster
hurriedly
took
his
watch
from
his
pocket
and
simms
turned
to
look
at
the
old
banjo
clock
in
his
office
and
both
men
quickly
said
in
one
voice
oh
no
jake
you
have
plenty
of
time
to
get
off
and
make
camp
before
dark
but
the
suggestion
made
by
the
driver
to
stop
in
oak
creek
was
the
means
of
hustling
kenneth
evans
along
his
way
the
entire
party
walked
with
him
down
the
road
towards
the
shed
where
jake
had
the
lumbering
and
there
they
waited
while
jake
drove
back
to
the
baggage
room
to
find
his
passenger
trunk
during
the
driver
absence
simms
explained
to
the
young
stranger
why
he
was
so
anxious
about
getting
the
man
from
carew
camp
away
from
oak
creek
that
afternoon
you
see
my
boy
these
nights
about
this
burg
when
the
miners
and
have
had
their
pay
are
one
bedlam
decent
folks
lock
their
doors
and
windows
and
never
show
a
light
that
might
attract
any
insanely
drunken
miner
that
why
i
want
you
far
on
your
road
to
camp
before
these
rough
foreigners
come
to
town
jake
would
revel
in
a
wild
night
of
it
but
he
get
fired
when
carew
heard
of
it
the
young
man
smiled
but
the
girls
were
anxious
to
make
the
most
of
the
few
minutes
left
before
jake
returned
for
the
tenderfoot
so
eleanor
began
the
moment
simms
concluded
when
do
you
suppose
jim
latimer
and
you
can
come
to
pebbly
pit
to
call
never
having
met
the
boss
of
the
crew
and
not
being
acquainted
with
distances
from
camp
to
the
ranch
i
could
say
but
jim
ought
to
be
able
to
judge
and
to
decide
on
a
day
we
could
then
write
you
could
we
do
forget
nolla
that
we
have
our
hands
full
of
important
work
on
top
notch
trail
for
an
indefinite
time
was
polly
warning
oh
i
did
forget
that
but
it
wo
keep
us
busy
more
than
a
few
days
returned
eleanor
that
reminds
me
simms
did
you
say
you
would
take
care
of
that
wire
to
john
asked
brewster
turning
to
the
lawyer
yes
i
send
a
trustworthy
man
down
the
line
when
the
train
comes
back
for
denver
and
he
can
send
his
message
couched
so
that
no
wise
guy
will
understand
what
it
means
from
some
telegraph
office
a
distance
from
oak
creek
said
simms
that
a
wise
plan
and
get
him
off
as
soon
as
possible
so
john
will
get
the
word
and
start
home
without
delay
added
brewster
jake
drove
up
beside
the
group
at
this
moment
and
sat
waiting
for
kenneth
to
say
to
his
new
friends
the
girls
reminded
him
again
to
be
sure
and
have
jim
bring
him
to
the
ranch
and
visit
as
soon
as
it
could
be
arranged
then
the
great
heavy
wagon
rolled
away
with
the
first
young
man
the
girls
had
seen
since
they
left
denver
chapter
xvii
sary
ambitions
dear
me
sighed
eleanor
that
boy
makes
me
think
of
civilization
again
her
companions
laughed
at
her
expression
and
polly
said
he
awfully
nice
is
he
yes
but
not
half
as
nice
as
jim
latimer
added
eleanor
oh
i
think
he
is
jim
just
takes
everything
for
granted
whether
you
agree
with
him
or
not
rejoined
polly
jim
latimer
is
only
a
child
now
his
brother
tom
is
what
i
should
call
wonderful
not
only
handsome
but
desirable
as
well
remarked
barbara
with
more
spirit
than
she
usually
showed
in
the
younger
conversation
eleanor
smiled
knowingly
and
said
if
tom
was
poverty
stricken
maybe
you
would
find
him
so
desirable
why
would
any
one
care
for
a
friend
asked
barbara
wonderingly
but
anne
hurriedly
changed
the
subject
how
long
do
you
think
it
might
take
before
john
gets
that
message
mr
brewster
oh
he
ought
to
be
within
hailing
distance
of
his
camp
and
he
get
the
wire
when
he
went
for
meals
or
to
sleep
allowing
until
morning
for
it
to
reach
him
and
another
day
for
him
to
pack
up
and
travel
he
ought
to
be
in
oak
creek
the
day
after
every
one
but
simms
watched
anne
face
to
see
her
blush
or
smile
joyously
but
simms
was
not
aware
of
any
tender
feelings
on
the
part
of
the
pretty
teacher
for
john
brewster
so
he
abruptly
suggested
a
plan
ah
would
wait
around
the
ranch
for
john
coming
sam
if
the
women
folks
are
going
up
to
top
notch
trail
with
us
all
well
and
good
but
waiting
about
until
john
and
the
engineer
gets
home
will
be
risky
business
for
the
claim
before
every
thief
in
oak
creek
and
for
miles
around
will
be
wise
to
that
gold
vein
and
most
of
them
will
want
to
sneak
up
there
and
try
to
jump
the
claim
oh
no
we
wo
postpone
going
up
there
to
guard
the
spot
explained
anne
anxiously
i
was
wondering
how
long
it
would
take
that
expert
engineer
to
arrive
on
the
ground
and
render
a
reliable
verdict
about
the
mine
eleanor
tittered
sure
that
is
all
anne
never
dreamed
that
john
brewster
might
accompany
the
expert
that
will
do
from
you
nolla
came
reprovingly
from
anne
but
the
girls
all
laughed
at
her
annoyance
having
concluded
all
the
business
necessary
in
connection
with
filing
and
signing
papers
and
arranging
details
about
the
trip
back
to
the
mine
on
the
following
day
the
ranch
party
said
to
simms
and
started
on
the
long
ride
to
pebbly
pit
the
sole
subject
of
conversation
between
the
elder
brewsters
and
barbara
was
the
gold
mine
and
the
possibilities
of
it
the
engrossing
thought
that
kept
anne
so
quiet
was
the
unexpected
and
imminent
visit
of
john
to
pebbly
pit
but
the
topic
that
now
enthused
polly
and
eleanor
was
the
arrival
of
kenneth
evans
and
his
acquaintance
with
jim
latimer
the
pleasant
young
man
who
had
spent
a
sunday
at
the
ranch
just
before
the
city
girls
had
arrived
i
wish
those
boys
could
join
our
party
up
to
the
cave
remarked
eleanor
to
polly
as
they
rode
behind
the
others
along
the
road
to
pebbly
pit
so
do
i
but
they
are
camping
too
far
from
us
for
that
we
are
almost
directly
opposite
their
camp
site
using
oak
creek
as
a
central
point
but
the
government
survey
plans
will
work
them
along
to
yellow
jacket
pass
and
from
that
point
along
the
wilderness
until
they
reach
buffalo
park
and
the
top
notch
trail
where
we
were
the
other
day
but
they
wo
reach
that
part
of
the
work
until
late
this
season
explained
polly
tom
latimer
brought
his
younger
brother
jim
to
see
us
in
chicago
when
jim
was
on
his
way
west
but
i
never
thought
he
would
be
so
near
me
this
summer
as
to
be
able
to
see
him
had
i
dreamed
of
such
being
the
case
i
would
have
paid
more
attention
to
him
at
the
time
i
said
to
myself
at
that
visit
we
never
meet
again
so
why
waste
time
over
him
polly
laughed
at
eleanor
frank
confession
and
added
well
when
tom
wrote
mother
that
his
little
brother
would
be
near
enough
to
pebbly
pit
to
permit
him
to
ride
over
now
and
then
for
a
visit
we
sent
word
at
once
for
carew
to
give
him
sundays
off
to
come
and
have
dinner
with
us
but
he
has
only
been
over
once
now
that
this
friend
is
in
camp
with
him
maybe
he
come
oftener
if
john
would
only
bring
tom
with
him
would
it
be
fine
planned
eleanor
anne
would
have
her
choice
john
bob
would
be
supremely
happy
if
she
could
flirt
with
tom
for
a
time
and
you
and
i
would
have
jim
and
ken
evans
polly
glanced
at
eleanor
in
surprise
and
said
why
nolla
i
like
that
at
all
it
will
be
lots
more
fun
if
we
all
go
about
together
for
a
good
time
but
john
is
coming
to
see
about
the
mine
not
to
enjoy
himself
you
do
think
do
you
that
having
anne
stewart
right
in
reach
that
he
going
to
spend
all
his
time
working
that
mine
he
going
to
divide
time
so
that
more
than
half
of
it
will
be
given
to
anne
then
he
work
on
the
mine
business
to
catch
up
on
his
work
was
eleanor
precocious
statement
polly
said
nothing
to
this
as
she
had
much
food
for
thought
given
her
in
eleanor
words
rather
than
pursue
a
subject
that
roused
her
jealousy
because
of
her
brother
john
she
spurred
her
horse
to
gallop
forward
to
join
the
others
of
the
party
father
what
did
you
say
in
your
telegram
to
john
asked
polly
when
she
slowed
up
beside
sam
brewster
simms
and
i
had
to
be
careful
what
we
said
so
no
one
on
the
wire
would
get
wise
as
to
our
real
meaning
so
i
wrote
out
party
on
at
the
ranch
big
doings
that
tom
and
you
must
be
in
on
also
bring
your
friend
who
came
with
you
the
time
we
talked
about
mining
rainbow
cliffs
do
not
delay
but
start
immediately
as
the
girls
have
the
time
of
their
lives
set
down
for
day
after
do
write
or
wire
but
come
on
receiving
this
message
you
see
that
was
the
only
way
i
could
think
of
to
get
john
off
without
letting
others
in
on
the
secret
every
one
in
these
parts
knows
the
city
girls
are
with
us
and
not
wonder
at
our
having
the
boys
come
home
for
a
visit
when
sam
brewster
concluded
his
explanation
anne
was
smiling
happily
and
barbara
lifted
her
head
a
bit
higher
as
she
said
how
nice
it
will
be
to
see
tom
latimer
again
his
company
much
eleanor
could
not
deny
herself
the
mean
little
satisfaction
in
saying
yes
bob
met
him
once
at
our
house
and
to
meet
him
several
times
after
that
at
various
social
gatherings
in
chicago
but
polly
pinched
her
friend
arm
for
silence
as
the
two
horses
crowded
close
together
to
pass
on
a
narrow
ledge
of
the
trail
that
ran
up
to
the
cliffs
if
tom
comes
with
john
and
that
expert
engineer
comes
too
mother
i
do
see
where
we
are
going
to
put
them
up
we
were
planning
that
as
we
rode
along
just
now
said
brewster
i
think
we
can
put
up
temporarily
in
the
loft
over
the
first
barn
where
father
keeps
his
account
books
and
other
business
papers
or
we
can
pitch
the
large
tent
under
the
trees
over
by
the
terrace
and
they
can
camp
there
it
will
be
far
more
comfortable
in
either
place
than
they
will
have
up
on
top
notch
or
what
they
have
been
having
in
the
movable
camp
with
the
engineers
all
this
summer
finding
sleeping
quarters
for
the
boys
is
the
least
of
our
worries
now
laughed
sam
brewster
keeping
off
and
guarding
the
cave
from
miners
who
would
steal
the
gold
as
fast
as
they
could
pick
it
or
blow
it
out
of
the
rock
is
more
concern
for
us
than
any
other
problem
at
present
well
we
wo
lack
for
excitement
if
all
you
fear
is
justly
founded
eh
laughed
eleanor
plainly
showing
how
thoroughly
she
was
enjoying
the
experience
and
its
promised
thrills
even
a
westerner
immune
to
thrills
would
have
a
few
entirely
new
ones
in
this
experience
chuckled
brewster
but
let
a
few
city
gals
like
you
three
and
a
quiet
little
mouse
like
polly
jump
right
into
such
a
game
as
this
promises
to
be
and
there
will
be
nothing
left
for
you
to
thrill
over
after
that
in
everyday
life
if
only
jim
latimer
and
ken
evans
could
be
at
the
ranch
to
go
with
us
when
we
start
for
the
cave
said
eleanor
for
the
second
time
this
time
her
remark
caused
brewster
to
think
then
he
said
it
is
queer
how
that
boy
resembled
our
old
friend
montresor
if
we
only
knew
what
part
of
the
east
montresor
came
from
i
have
always
said
he
was
not
traveling
under
his
own
name
but
probably
was
using
a
family
name
to
hide
behind
yes
and
that
may
explain
the
reason
we
never
had
any
reply
to
our
widely
circulated
advertisements
for
his
relatives
added
brewster
if
montresor
really
was
related
to
this
young
man
father
he
surely
would
have
said
something
when
simms
mentioned
the
resemblance
and
asked
the
stranger
if
he
knew
of
a
relative
being
in
colorado
said
polly
montresor
had
white
hair
it
is
true
but
that
did
not
say
that
he
was
an
old
man
he
was
prematurely
wrinkled
from
worry
and
hardships
but
he
was
not
much
more
than
forty
i
should
say
ventured
brewster
what
are
you
leading
up
to
sam
asked
brewster
i
was
just
thinking
aloud
that
montresor
could
have
had
a
son
as
old
or
as
young
as
this
kenneth
evans
if
he
had
gone
to
the
klondike
as
we
believed
the
boy
would
have
been
too
young
to
remember
his
dad
very
distinctly
who
knows
what
drove
old
montresor
away
from
home
to
seek
adventure
or
gold
so
far
north
as
in
the
klondike
he
and
his
wife
may
have
separated
through
some
misunderstanding
such
as
that
letter
would
lead
us
to
infer
and
his
eastern
relatives
may
have
kept
all
facts
or
news
of
him
from
this
boy
the
poor
man
pride
and
determination
to
prove
himself
innocent
of
some
wrong
kept
him
from
communicating
with
his
people
we
know
that
from
his
own
letter
so
i
would
not
be
greatly
surprised
if
we
eventually
learn
that
kenneth
evans
is
really
a
son
of
montresor
oh
brewster
is
that
exactly
what
i
said
to
you
before
when
you
hushed
me
up
declared
eleanor
delighted
over
her
romantic
vision
i
hushed
you
up
because
you
went
on
weaving
stuff
that
dreams
are
made
of
not
because
you
hinted
that
this
youth
might
be
montresor
son
corrected
sam
brewster
the
others
laughed
at
eleanor
and
as
they
rode
past
the
cliffs
now
glimmering
faintly
in
the
rays
of
the
new
moon
rising
over
the
edge
of
the
old
crater
polly
said
with
a
sigh
thank
goodness
we
are
almost
home
in
time
for
supper
the
materialistic
craving
in
polly
for
a
good
meal
was
so
different
from
eleanor
dreams
of
romance
for
her
friend
that
the
two
elder
brewsters
felt
relieved
to
hear
the
exclamation
soon
afterwards
the
riders
drew
rein
at
the
porch
where
jeb
was
awaiting
the
return
of
the
party
wall
did
find
out
if
the
mine
was
the
same
as
old
man
montresor
claim
asked
jeb
eagerly
as
they
dismounted
what
that
jeb
asked
sam
brewster
frowningly
why
sary
says
went
to
oak
crick
to
file
papers
and
make
sure
that
montresor
claim
is
the
same
mine
like
polly
discovered
up
on
the
trail
ai
it
so
wondered
jeb
curiously
the
two
elder
brewsters
exchanged
glances
and
the
girls
had
to
laugh
at
having
been
completely
fooled
by
clever
sary
dodd
then
brewster
thought
best
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
the
entire
matter
well
we
were
not
sure
when
we
left
pebbly
pit
this
morning
whether
this
claim
was
good
or
not
so
we
did
not
say
a
word
about
it
to
either
sary
or
you
but
she
must
have
overheard
us
speaking
about
it
last
night
yeh
that
what
she
said
to
me
she
had
to
wait
so
long
fer
to
come
to
supper
last
night
that
she
coulden
help
hearin
what
was
said
she
says
it
will
be
a
grand
day
fer
her
and
me
when
get
this
mine
goin
sary
figgers
that
wo
stay
in
oak
crick
ner
on
a
ranch
once
you
have
all
this
money
polly
make
go
to
some
fine
city
to
live
explained
jeb
innocently
huh
is
that
so
sneered
sam
brewster
angrily
jeb
was
gathering
up
the
reins
of
the
horses
as
he
spoke
and
now
he
turned
to
wonder
at
his
master
tone
brewster
was
about
to
say
something
conciliatory
when
sary
rushed
out
of
the
side
door
ah
was
jus
comin
to
see
who
rode
up
when
ah
hearn
jeb
talk
now
lissun
to
me
whiles
ah
explains
ah
spoke
me
and
jeb
was
sittin
over
dinner
this
noon
when
ah
says
to
him
the
brewsters
plan
to
leave
pebbly
pit
jeb
will
stay
on
and
wuk
the
ranch
fer
or
buy
it
outright
now
was
that
a
most
natchul
thing
to
ask
sary
apparent
guilelessness
made
the
girls
stare
and
her
mistress
smile
understandingly
of
course
sary
go
on
wall
then
jeb
diden
know
a
thing
about
the
gold
mine
ner
what
rode
to
oak
crick
fer
so
ah
hed
to
explain
he
was
that
flabbergasted
my
ah
feared
he
keel
over
right
at
table
so
ah
hurried
to
brace
him
up
wid
puttin
an
ambitious
idee
in
his
head
that
ah
mentioned
his
takin
over
pebbly
pit
here
jeb
interpolated
but
said
sary
that
no
woman
could
remain
on
the
ranch
ef
all
the
ladies
left
and
you
told
me
a
man
needed
a
on
such
a
big
place
sary
frowned
down
on
meek
little
jeb
but
her
displeasure
was
wasted
for
jeb
was
too
earnestly
concerned
over
his
master
future
plans
to
see
the
widow
expression
the
girls
were
so
intensely
amused
over
this
new
development
in
sary
affairs
that
they
forgot
about
their
own
ambitions
for
the
time
being
of
course
ah
said
that
affirmed
sary
when
all
other
escape
by
excuses
seemed
vain
ah
also
said
to
jeb
that
now
he
was
callin
on
me
evenin
and
by
such
ways
showin
the
public
he
was
courtin
me
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
to
marry
afore
leave
the
ranch
then
we
both
could
pitch
in
and
do
fer
your
interests
as
well
as
fer
our
own
what
two
folks
separate
ca
do
as
well
see
every
one
could
see
plainly
what
sary
meant
and
no
one
had
the
heart
to
ruin
her
romance
by
trying
to
show
jeb
that
he
was
a
doomed
benedict
if
he
allowed
himself
to
be
so
beguiled
by
a
scheming
widow
jeb
if
there
any
one
on
earth
who
can
make
me
leave
pebbly
pit
let
me
know
who
it
is
and
ah
mighty
soon
fight
it
out
with
him
declared
sam
brewster
fervently
brewster
and
the
girls
laughed
at
his
intensity
but
jeb
face
lighted
up
with
relief
while
sary
clouded
with
doubt
then
jeb
led
the
horses
away
and
a
happy
whistle
sounded
from
his
lips
as
he
marched
towards
the
barn
and
sary
stood
looking
after
his
receding
form
as
if
she
was
seeing
her
future
happiness
vanish
also
the
weary
riders
went
indoors
and
after
brewster
had
removed
her
riding
togs
she
went
to
the
kitchen
to
see
what
was
ready
for
supper
to
her
joy
she
found
sary
had
prepared
an
unusually
tempting
meal
and
had
everything
in
readiness
to
serve
the
table
had
been
set
in
the
as
it
was
too
dark
to
eat
under
the
trees
and
soon
after
the
girls
had
washed
and
changed
their
clothes
all
sat
down
to
enjoy
the
and
carefully
seasoned
viands
sary
and
jeb
had
had
supper
la
more
than
an
hour
before
the
riders
got
home
so
sary
gave
her
attention
to
waiting
on
the
famished
family
as
she
served
and
passed
dishes
she
conversed
volubly
about
the
mine
and
the
claim
and
the
trouble
so
much
work
would
make
for
brewster
if
he
kept
on
with
the
ranch
at
the
same
time
not
at
all
sary
ah
shall
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
work
at
the
mine
john
and
his
engineers
will
look
after
all
that
but
this
does
not
mean
that
jeb
must
always
remain
a
hired
man
if
the
time
comes
when
he
wants
to
settle
down
at
pebbly
pit
and
take
to
himself
a
spouse
ah
shall
be
the
first
man
to
reach
out
a
hand
to
help
him
on
in
life
he
shall
have
certain
parts
of
the
ranch
to
work
on
shares
if
he
prefers
that
and
he
can
build
a
good
home
for
himself
down
on
the
road
that
runs
by
the
pastures
ai
sayin
this
in
a
joke
be
yuh
sam
brewster
asked
sary
breathlessly
no
indeed
sary
ah
want
jeb
to
make
a
good
match
that
all
he
seldom
goes
away
from
the
ranch
other
than
driving
to
oak
creek
and
he
does
not
have
opportunity
to
see
or
meet
girls
so
ah
am
seriously
thinking
of
giving
him
a
vacation
very
soon
and
sending
him
to
denver
for
a
week
or
two
just
to
give
him
a
chance
to
get
acquainted
with
other
women
and
then
he
be
able
to
judge
what
sort
of
a
girl
will
suit
him
best
for
a
wife
sary
gasped
fearfully
at
this
unexpected
plan
of
sam
brewster
and
her
grasp
on
the
soup
ladle
relaxed
so
that
it
fell
to
the
floor
with
a
ringing
echo
but
she
paid
no
attention
to
it
she
stood
with
mouth
open
staring
at
the
master
of
pebbly
pit
brewster
felt
sincerely
sorry
for
her
but
the
four
girls
had
to
smother
their
laughter
behind
the
dinner
napkins
then
sary
found
her
power
of
speech
why
sam
brewster
ca
mean
that
send
dear
innocent
jeb
to
such
a
wicked
city
as
denver
all
alone
to
be
caught
by
them
wolves
ai
you
tell
of
flirty
gals
what
goes
about
nice
young
men
jus
fer
a
good
time
like
as
not
our
jeb
get
lassoed
by
one
of
and
she
marry
him
fer
his
money
er
git
it
all
away
from
him
afore
she
lets
him
go
ah
seen
it
all
over
and
over
again
in
the
movies
at
oak
crick
sary
almost
wept
as
she
described
the
lamentable
case
of
jeb
if
he
was
permitted
to
visit
denver
alone
do
worry
over
jeb
sary
he
has
gone
yet
said
brewster
sending
her
husband
a
signal
to
keep
quiet
sary
went
out
of
the
room
and
when
polly
called
for
a
cup
no
one
replied
so
she
had
to
jump
up
and
go
to
the
kitchen
for
her
own
cup
but
the
kitchen
was
empty
no
sary
to
be
seen
anywhere
polly
reported
this
discovery
when
she
came
back
to
the
table
and
brewster
spoke
impatiently
to
her
husband
you
have
any
judgment
about
love
affairs
sam
do
you
know
that
you
are
actually
throwing
jeb
at
sary
head
by
saying
such
things
as
you
did
about
giving
jeb
enough
vacation
to
allow
him
to
go
to
the
city
and
find
a
pretty
girl
for
himself
brewster
sat
back
in
his
chair
and
dropped
his
fork
upon
the
table
in
surprise
he
turned
wondering
eyes
at
his
wife
as
he
said
ah
only
said
that
to
show
sary
that
she
must
bide
her
time
with
jeb
and
give
him
a
chance
to
make
an
honest
choice
for
a
wife
that
what
you
to
do
sam
but
what
you
actually
accomplished
was
to
give
sary
a
fright
over
having
jeb
get
out
of
her
snare
and
now
she
move
heaven
and
earth
to
consummate
her
own
schemes
to
get
jeb
i
would
be
one
bit
surprised
if
we
should
find
out
that
she
is
even
now
helping
jeb
at
the
barn
and
trying
to
wheedle
him
into
an
out
and
out
proposal
there
was
reply
at
that
sam
brewster
jumped
up
and
without
asking
to
be
excused
rushed
away
and
down
the
road
that
led
to
the
barns
brewster
with
the
girls
laughed
at
his
sudden
departure
and
when
supper
was
over
with
the
master
of
the
house
still
absent
they
all
cleared
away
the
meal
and
piled
up
the
dishes
for
sary
to
wash
in
the
morning
then
brewster
came
back
well
mary
you
must
have
second
sight
is
all
ah
can
say
sary
was
out
helping
jeb
with
the
horses
sure
enough
and
ah
overheard
her
sayin
when
ah
came
up
to
the
door
if
ever
has
time
to
go
visitin
to
denver
or
any
such
place
it
would
be
a
fine
honeymoon
for
me
and
you
woulden
it
as
brewster
repeated
sary
words
he
glanced
at
his
wife
but
every
one
laughed
heartily
at
his
expression
and
sary
clever
anticipation
of
jeb
vacation
brewster
wagged
her
head
wisely
as
she
said
did
i
tell
you
so
sam
now
sary
will
have
no
rest
nor
indeed
give
poor
jeb
any
peace
of
mind
until
she
has
him
firmly
attached
to
her
by
vows
once
the
bans
are
announced
at
church
she
knows
jeb
will
not
try
to
dodge
them
and
his
responsibility
well
mary
after
this
experience
ah
swear
ah
shall
have
nothing
more
to
do
in
trying
to
break
up
any
matches
no
not
even
if
my
own
children
plan
to
marry
without
having
due
time
to
judge
what
is
best
for
them
his
sigh
of
sacrifice
in
such
a
dire
case
made
all
eyes
turn
to
anne
and
her
companions
laughed
teasingly
at
her
blush
now
girls
all
off
to
bed
at
once
if
you
expect
to
go
with
us
at
daybreak
was
brewster
advice
that
cut
the
conversation
short
i
have
no
objections
to
tumbling
into
bed
confessed
polly
nor
i
if
it
were
not
for
that
ride
i
could
sleep
all
day
added
eleanor
hiding
a
yawn
ah
will
set
the
big
ben
i
think
said
brewster
so
that
we
will
not
miss
simms
and
his
party
at
lone
pine
blaze
in
the
morning
who
besides
simms
is
going
with
us
father
asked
polly
why
my
old
pal
the
sheriff
and
his
men
simms
and
a
few
of
his
best
friends
and
mike
as
a
guide
oh
really
why
it
will
be
a
large
party
wo
it
cried
polly
delightedly
we
need
a
large
party
ah
thinking
girls
if
our
surmises
are
right
in
fact
the
sheriff
plans
to
send
an
extra
posse
up
by
a
different
trail
in
order
to
head
off
any
or
men
who
might
happen
to
meet
them
on
this
unfrequented
ride
along
top
notch
trail
my
it
makes
me
tingle
deliciously
at
thought
of
the
fun
we
will
have
if
we
have
to
fight
for
the
mine
said
eleanor
i
do
think
we
women
ought
to
go
if
there
is
the
least
danger
whimpered
barbara
glancing
from
one
to
the
other
in
the
group
you
can
stay
at
home
and
chaperone
sary
said
eleanor
i
do
nothing
of
the
kind
eleanor
maynard
if
you
and
the
others
go
i
shall
go
too
declared
barbara
jealously
well
no
one
in
this
family
will
go
unless
you
all
get
into
bed
inside
of
the
next
five
minutes
said
brewster
do
take
time
to
use
cold
cream
and
wrinkle
plasters
this
night
laughingly
the
girls
said
and
left
the
two
adult
brewsters
alone
the
moment
the
door
closed
upon
the
last
girl
brewster
made
sure
that
sary
was
in
her
room
with
the
door
closed
and
then
she
tiptoed
back
to
join
her
husband
she
spoke
in
a
whisper
sam
do
you
really
think
there
will
be
any
danger
of
on
top
notch
there
always
trouble
where
gold
is
to
be
had
returned
brewster
seriously
but
i
mean
do
you
apprehend
it
and
thus
asked
the
sheriff
and
his
men
to
ride
with
us
simms
and
the
sheriff
think
so
it
was
his
idea
to
prepare
against
any
surprises
along
the
road
and
after
we
get
there
but
it
was
the
sheriff
idea
to
get
rattlesnake
mike
to
guide
us
and
hire
him
to
cook
while
we
are
in
camp
mike
is
an
honest
indian
you
know
mary
and
we
may
need
one
who
is
as
good
a
woodsman
as
he
is
well
sam
if
i
thought
there
was
to
be
the
slightest
risk
to
these
girls
in
any
way
whatever
i
should
refuse
to
allow
them
to
go
declared
brewster
you
do
think
that
i
would
consent
to
have
polly
go
if
i
thought
there
was
to
be
any
trouble
do
you
all
the
gold
in
the
earth
bribe
me
to
do
such
a
foolish
thing
i
thought
you
may
belittle
any
risk
we
might
run
you
are
so
accustomed
to
these
ruffians
at
oak
creek
but
three
city
girls
are
different
from
western
ranchmen
even
polly
and
i
are
better
seasoned
for
the
adventures
we
may
encounter
than
anne
and
her
friends
was
brewster
reply
well
if
you
feel
the
least
nervous
over
this
trip
you
had
better
remain
at
home
with
the
girls
ah
reckon
can
readily
find
the
cave
by
the
descriptions
polly
gave
us
and
by
the
claim
she
staked
then
too
rattlesnake
mike
can
guide
us
to
any
spot
on
the
mountaintop
i
do
want
to
deprive
the
girls
of
any
safe
adventure
we
may
experience
sam
nor
do
i
want
them
to
run
risks
so
we
had
better
wait
and
leave
it
entirely
to
them
if
you
feel
sure
nothing
would
happen
through
an
encounter
with
ruffians
said
brewster
oh
if
that
is
what
worries
you
mary
rest
your
mind
on
that
score
no
one
will
attack
such
a
large
party
especially
when
the
sheriff
and
his
men
are
in
the
party
well
then
sam
we
get
out
the
supplies
you
need
to
take
for
the
excursion
and
then
you
can
catch
a
few
hours
sleep
but
it
will
take
another
book
to
tell
what
actually
did
happen
there
and
on
grizzly
slide
and
who
ken
proved
to
be
and
whether
john
brewster
loved
anne
stewart
or
tom
latimer
fell
a
victim
to
blandishments
all
these
queries
are
answered
in
the
second
volume
called
polly
and
eleanor
