you
have

book
i
the
forbidden
room
the
filigree
ball
i
the
moore
house
are
you
speaking
of
the
moore
house
for
a
detective
whose
talents
had
not
been
recognized
at
headquarters
i
possessed
an
ambition
which
fortunately
for
my
standing
with
the
lieutenant
of
the
precinct
had
not
yet
been
expressed
in
words
though
i
had
small
reason
for
expecting
great
things
of
myself
i
had
always
cherished
the
hope
that
if
a
big
case
came
my
way
i
should
be
found
able
to
do
something
with
it
something
more
that
is
than
i
had
seen
accomplished
by
the
police
of
the
district
of
columbia
since
i
had
had
the
honor
of
being
one
of
their
number
therefore
when
i
found
myself
plunged
almost
without
my
own
volition
into
the
jeffrey
moore
affair
i
believed
that
the
opportunity
had
come
whereby
i
might
distinguish
myself
it
had
complications
this
affair
greater
ones
than
the
public
ever
knew
keen
as
the
interest
in
it
ran
both
in
and
out
of
washington
this
is
why
i
propose
to
tell
the
story
of
this
great
tragedy
from
my
own
standpoint
even
if
in
so
doing
i
risk
the
charge
of
attempting
to
exploit
my
own
connection
with
this
celebrated
case
in
its
course
i
encountered
as
many
disappointments
as
triumphs
and
brought
out
of
the
affair
a
heart
as
sore
as
it
was
satisfied
for
i
am
a
lover
of
women
and
but
i
am
keeping
you
from
the
story
itself
i
was
at
the
the
night
uncle
david
came
in
he
was
always
called
uncle
david
even
by
the
urchins
who
followed
him
in
the
street
so
i
am
showing
him
no
disrespect
gentleman
though
he
is
by
giving
him
a
title
which
as
completely
characterized
him
in
those
days
as
did
his
moody
ways
his
quaint
attire
and
the
persistence
with
which
he
kept
at
his
side
his
great
mastiff
rudge
i
had
long
since
heard
of
the
old
gentleman
as
one
of
the
most
interesting
residents
of
the
precinct
i
had
even
seen
him
more
than
once
on
the
avenue
but
i
had
never
before
been
brought
face
to
face
with
him
and
consequently
had
much
too
superficial
a
knowledge
of
his
countenance
to
determine
offhand
whether
the
uneasy
light
in
his
small
gray
eyes
was
natural
to
them
or
simply
the
result
of
present
excitement
but
when
he
began
to
talk
i
detected
an
unmistakable
tremor
in
his
tones
and
decided
that
he
was
in
a
state
of
suppressed
agitation
though
he
appeared
to
have
nothing
more
alarming
to
impart
than
the
fact
that
he
had
seen
a
light
burning
in
some
house
presumably
empty
it
was
all
so
trivial
that
i
gave
him
but
scant
attention
till
he
let
a
name
fall
which
caused
me
to
prick
up
my
ears
and
even
to
put
in
a
word
the
moore
house
he
had
said
the
moore
house
i
repeated
in
amazement
are
you
speaking
of
the
moore
house
a
thousand
recollections
came
with
the
name
what
other
he
grumbled
directing
toward
me
a
look
as
keen
as
it
was
impatient
do
you
think
that
i
would
bother
myself
long
about
a
house
i
had
no
interest
in
or
drag
rudge
from
his
warm
rug
to
save
some
ungrateful
neighbor
from
a
possible
burglary
no
it
is
my
house
which
some
rogue
has
chosen
to
enter
that
is
he
suavely
corrected
as
he
saw
surprise
in
every
eye
the
house
which
the
law
will
give
me
if
anything
ever
happens
to
that
chit
of
a
girl
whom
my
brother
left
behind
him
growling
some
words
at
the
dog
who
showed
a
decided
inclination
to
lie
down
where
he
was
the
old
man
made
for
the
door
and
in
another
moment
would
have
been
in
the
street
if
i
had
not
stepped
after
him
you
are
a
moore
and
live
in
or
near
that
old
house
i
asked
the
surprise
with
which
he
met
this
question
daunted
me
a
little
how
long
have
you
been
in
washington
i
should
like
to
ask
was
his
acrid
retort
oh
some
five
months
his
good
nature
or
what
passed
for
such
in
this
irascible
old
man
returned
in
an
instant
and
he
curtly
but
not
unkindly
remarked
you
have
learned
much
in
that
time
then
with
a
nod
more
ceremonious
than
many
another
man
bow
he
added
with
sudden
dignity
i
am
of
the
elder
branch
an
live
in
the
cottage
fronting
the
old
place
i
am
the
only
resident
on
the
block
when
you
have
lived
here
longer
you
will
know
why
that
especial
neighborhood
is
not
a
favorite
one
with
those
who
can
not
boast
of
the
moore
blood
for
the
present
let
us
attribute
the
bad
name
that
it
holds
to
malaria
and
with
a
significant
hitch
of
his
lean
shoulders
which
set
in
undulating
motion
every
fold
of
the
cloak
he
wore
he
started
again
for
the
door
but
my
curiosity
was
by
this
time
roused
to
fever
heat
i
knew
more
about
this
house
than
he
gave
me
credit
for
no
one
who
had
read
the
papers
of
late
much
less
a
man
connected
with
the
police
could
help
being
well
informed
in
all
the
details
of
its
remarkable
history
what
i
had
failed
to
know
was
his
close
relationship
to
the
family
whose
name
for
the
last
two
weeks
had
been
in
every
mouth
wait
i
called
out
you
say
that
you
live
opposite
the
moore
house
you
can
then
tell
me
but
he
had
no
mind
to
stop
for
any
gossip
it
was
all
in
the
papers
he
called
back
read
them
but
first
be
sure
to
find
out
who
has
struck
a
light
in
the
house
that
we
all
know
has
not
even
a
caretaker
in
it
it
was
good
advice
my
duty
and
my
curiosity
both
led
me
to
follow
it
perhaps
you
have
heard
of
the
distinguishing
feature
of
this
house
if
so
you
do
not
need
my
explanations
but
if
for
any
reason
you
are
ignorant
of
the
facts
which
within
a
very
short
time
have
set
a
final
seal
of
horror
upon
this
old
historic
dwelling
then
you
will
be
glad
to
read
what
has
made
and
will
continue
to
make
the
moore
house
in
washington
one
to
be
pointed
at
in
daylight
and
shunned
after
dark
not
only
by
superstitious
colored
folk
but
by
all
who
are
susceptible
to
the
most
ordinary
emotions
of
fear
and
dread
it
was
standing
when
washington
was
a
village
it
antedates
the
capitol
and
the
white
house
built
by
a
man
of
wealth
it
bears
to
this
day
the
impress
of
the
large
ideas
and
quiet
elegance
of
colonial
times
but
the
shadow
which
speedily
fell
across
it
made
it
a
marked
place
even
in
those
early
days
while
it
has
always
escaped
the
hackneyed
epithet
of
haunted
families
that
have
moved
in
have
as
quickly
moved
out
giving
as
their
excuse
that
no
happiness
was
to
be
found
there
and
that
sleep
was
impossible
under
its
roof
that
there
was
some
reason
for
this
lack
of
rest
within
walls
which
were
not
without
their
tragic
reminiscences
all
must
acknowledge
death
had
often
occurred
there
and
while
this
fact
can
be
stated
in
regard
to
most
old
houses
it
is
not
often
that
one
can
say
as
in
this
case
that
it
was
invariably
sudden
and
invariably
of
one
character
a
lifeless
man
lying
outstretched
on
a
certain
hearthstone
might
be
found
once
in
a
house
and
awaken
no
special
comment
but
when
this
same
discovery
has
been
made
twice
if
not
thrice
during
the
history
of
a
single
dwelling
one
might
surely
be
pardoned
a
distrust
of
its
seemingly
appointments
and
discern
in
its
slowly
darkening
walls
the
presence
of
an
evil
which
if
left
to
itself
might
perish
in
the
natural
decay
of
the
e
place
but
which
if
met
and
challenged
might
strike
again
and
make
another
blot
on
its
hearthstone
but
these
are
old
fables
which
i
should
hardly
presume
to
mention
had
it
not
been
for
the
recent
occurrence
which
has
recalled
them
to
all
men
minds
and
given
to
this
long
empty
and
slowly
crumbling
building
an
importance
which
has
spread
its
fame
from
one
end
of
the
country
to
the
other
i
refer
to
the
tragedy
attending
the
wedding
lately
celebrated
there
veronica
moore
rich
pretty
and
wilful
had
long
cherished
a
strange
liking
for
this
frowning
old
home
of
her
ancestors
and
at
the
most
critical
time
of
her
life
conceived
the
idea
of
proving
to
herself
and
to
society
at
large
that
no
real
ban
lay
upon
it
save
in
the
imagination
of
the
superstitious
so
being
about
to
marry
the
choice
of
her
young
heart
she
caused
this
house
to
be
opened
for
the
wedding
ceremony
with
what
result
you
know
though
the
occasion
was
a
joyous
one
and
accompanied
by
all
that
could
give
cheer
to
such
a
function
it
had
not
escaped
the
shadow
one
of
the
guests
straying
into
the
room
of
ancient
and
unhallowed
memory
the
one
room
which
had
not
been
thrown
open
to
the
crowd
had
been
found
within
five
minutes
of
the
ceremony
lying
on
its
dolorous
hearthstone
dead
and
though
the
bride
was
spared
a
knowledge
of
the
dreadful
fact
till
the
holy
words
were
said
a
panic
had
seized
the
guests
and
emptied
the
houses
suddenly
and
completely
as
though
the
plague
had
been
discovered
there
this
is
why
i
hastened
to
follow
uncle
david
when
he
told
me
that
all
was
not
right
in
this
house
of
tragic
memories
ii
i
enter
though
past
seventy
uncle
david
was
a
brisk
walker
and
on
this
night
in
particular
he
sped
along
so
fast
that
he
was
down
h
street
by
the
time
i
had
turned
the
corner
at
new
hampshire
avenue
his
gaunt
but
not
ungraceful
figure
merged
in
that
of
the
dog
trotting
closely
at
his
heels
was
the
only
moving
object
in
the
dreary
vista
of
this
the
most
desolate
block
in
washington
as
i
neared
the
building
i
was
so
impressed
by
the
surrounding
stillness
that
i
was
ready
to
vow
that
the
shadows
were
denser
here
than
elsewhere
and
that
the
few
gas
lamps
which
flickered
at
intervals
down
the
street
shone
with
a
more
feeble
ray
than
in
any
other
equal
length
of
street
in
washington
meanwhile
the
shadow
of
uncle
david
had
vanished
from
the
pavement
he
had
paused
beside
a
fence
which
hung
with
vines
surrounded
and
nearly
hid
from
sight
the
little
cottage
he
had
mentioned
as
the
only
house
on
the
block
with
the
exception
of
the
great
moore
place
in
other
words
his
own
home
as
i
came
abreast
of
him
i
heard
him
muttering
not
to
his
dog
as
was
his
custom
but
to
himself
in
fact
the
dog
was
not
to
be
seen
and
this
desertion
on
the
part
of
his
constant
companion
seemed
to
add
to
his
disturbance
and
affect
him
beyond
all
reason
i
could
distinguish
these
words
amongst
the
many
he
directed
toward
the
unseen
animal
you
a
knowing
one
too
knowing
you
see
that
loosened
shutter
over
the
way
as
plainly
as
i
do
but
you
a
coward
to
slink
away
from
it
i
do
i
face
the
thing
and
what
more
i
show
you
yet
what
i
think
of
a
dog
that
ca
stand
his
ground
and
help
his
old
master
out
with
some
show
of
courage
creaks
does
it
well
let
it
creak
i
do
mind
its
creaking
glad
as
i
should
be
to
know
whose
hand
halloo
you
come
have
you
this
to
me
i
had
just
stepped
up
to
him
yes
i
come
now
what
is
the
matter
with
the
moore
house
he
must
have
expected
the
question
yet
his
answer
was
a
long
time
coming
his
voice
too
sounded
strained
and
was
pitched
quite
too
high
to
be
natural
but
he
evidently
did
not
expect
me
to
show
surprise
at
his
manner
look
at
that
window
over
there
he
cried
at
last
that
one
with
the
slightly
open
shutter
watch
and
you
will
see
that
shutter
move
there
it
creaked
did
you
hear
it
a
growl
it
was
more
like
a
moan
came
from
the
porch
behind
us
instantly
the
old
gentleman
turned
and
with
a
gesture
as
fierce
as
it
was
instinctive
shouted
out
be
still
there
if
you
have
the
courage
to
face
a
blowing
shutter
keep
your
jaws
shut
and
do
let
every
fellow
who
happens
along
know
what
a
fool
you
are
i
declare
he
maundered
on
half
to
himself
and
half
to
me
that
dog
is
getting
old
he
ca
be
trusted
any
more
he
forsakes
his
master
just
when
the
rest
was
lost
in
his
throat
which
rattled
with
something
more
than
impatient
anger
meanwhile
i
had
been
attentively
scrutinizing
the
house
thus
pointedly
brought
to
my
notice
i
had
seen
it
many
times
before
but
as
it
happened
had
never
stopped
to
look
at
it
when
the
huge
trees
surrounding
it
were
shrouded
in
darkness
the
black
hollow
of
its
disused
portal
looked
out
from
shadows
which
acquired
some
of
their
somberness
from
the
tragic
memories
connected
with
its
empty
void
its
aspect
was
scarcely
reassuring
not
that
superstition
lent
its
terrors
to
the
lonely
scene
but
that
through
the
blank
panes
of
the
window
alternately
appearing
and
disappearing
from
view
as
the
shutter
pointed
out
by
uncle
david
blew
to
and
fro
in
the
wind
i
saw
or
was
persuaded
that
i
saw
a
beam
of
light
which
argued
an
unknown
presence
within
walls
which
had
so
lately
been
declared
unfit
for
any
man
habitation
you
are
right
i
now
remarked
to
the
uneasy
figure
at
my
side
some
one
is
prowling
through
the
house
yonder
can
it
possibly
be
jeffrey
or
her
husband
at
night
and
with
no
gas
in
the
house
hardly
the
words
were
natural
but
the
voice
was
not
neither
was
his
manner
quite
suited
to
the
occasion
giving
him
another
sly
glance
and
marking
how
uneasily
he
edged
away
from
me
in
the
darkness
i
cried
out
more
cheerily
than
he
possibly
expected
i
will
summon
another
officer
and
we
three
will
just
slip
across
and
investigate
not
i
was
his
violent
rejoinder
as
he
swung
open
a
gate
concealed
in
the
vines
behind
him
the
jeffreys
would
resent
my
intrusion
if
they
ever
happened
to
hear
of
it
indeed
i
laughed
sounding
my
whistle
then
soberly
enough
for
i
was
more
than
a
little
struck
by
the
oddity
of
his
behavior
and
thought
him
as
well
worth
investigation
as
the
house
in
which
he
showed
such
an
interest
you
should
let
that
count
come
and
see
what
up
in
the
house
you
are
so
ready
to
call
yours
but
he
only
drew
farther
into
the
shade
i
have
no
business
over
there
he
objected
veronica
and
i
have
never
been
on
good
terms
i
was
not
even
invited
to
her
wedding
though
i
live
within
a
stone
throw
of
the
door
no
i
have
done
my
duty
in
calling
attention
to
that
light
and
whether
it
the
of
a
burglar
perhaps
you
do
know
that
there
are
rare
treasures
on
the
book
shelves
of
the
great
library
or
whether
it
is
the
fantastic
illumination
which
frightens
and
some
i
done
with
it
and
done
with
you
too
for
as
he
said
this
he
mounted
to
his
door
and
disappeared
under
the
vines
hanging
like
a
shroud
over
the
front
of
the
house
in
another
moment
the
rich
peal
of
an
organ
sounded
from
within
followed
by
the
prolonged
howling
of
rudge
who
either
from
a
too
keen
appreciation
of
his
master
music
or
in
utter
disapproval
of
it
no
one
i
believe
has
ever
been
able
to
make
out
which
was
accustomed
to
add
this
undesirable
accompaniment
to
every
strain
from
the
old
man
hand
the
playing
did
not
cease
because
of
these
outrageous
discords
on
the
contrary
it
increased
in
force
and
volume
causing
rudge
expression
of
pain
or
pleasure
to
increase
also
the
result
can
be
imagined
as
i
listened
to
the
intolerable
howls
of
the
dog
cutting
clean
through
the
exquisite
harmonies
of
his
master
i
wondered
if
the
shadows
cast
by
the
frowning
structure
of
the
great
moore
house
were
alone
to
blame
for
uncle
david
lack
of
neighbors
meantime
hibbard
who
was
the
first
to
hear
my
signal
came
running
down
the
block
as
he
joined
me
the
light
or
what
we
chose
to
call
a
light
appeared
again
in
the
window
toward
which
my
attention
had
been
directed
some
one
in
the
moore
house
i
declared
in
as
matter
tones
as
i
could
command
hibbard
is
a
big
fellow
the
biggest
fellow
on
the
force
and
so
far
as
my
own
experience
with
him
had
gone
as
stolid
and
imperturbable
as
the
best
of
us
but
after
a
quick
glance
at
the
towering
walls
of
the
lonely
building
he
showed
decided
embarrassment
and
seemed
in
no
haste
to
cross
the
street
with
difficulty
i
concealed
my
disgust
come
i
cried
stepping
down
from
the
curb
let
go
over
and
investigate
the
property
is
valuable
the
furnishings
handsome
and
there
is
no
end
of
costly
books
on
the
library
shelves
you
have
matches
and
a
revolver
he
nodded
quietly
showing
me
first
the
one
then
the
other
then
with
a
sheepish
air
which
he
endeavored
to
carry
of
with
a
laugh
he
cried
have
you
use
for
if
so
i
quite
willing
to
part
with
for
a
i
was
more
than
amazed
at
this
evidence
of
weakness
in
one
i
had
always
considered
as
tough
and
impenetrable
as
flint
rock
thrusting
back
the
hand
with
which
he
had
half
drawn
into
view
the
weapon
i
had
mentioned
i
put
on
my
sternest
sir
and
led
the
way
across
the
street
as
i
did
so
tossed
back
the
words
we
may
come
upon
a
gang
you
do
not
wish
me
to
face
some
men
alone
you
wo
find
any
men
there
was
his
muttered
reply
nevertheless
he
followed
me
though
with
less
spirit
than
i
liked
considering
that
my
own
manner
was
in
a
measure
assumed
and
that
i
was
not
without
sympathy
well
let
me
say
for
a
dog
who
preferred
howling
a
dismal
accompaniment
to
his
master
music
to
keeping
open
watch
over
a
neighborhood
dominated
by
the
unhallowed
structure
i
now
propose
to
enter
the
house
is
too
well
known
for
me
to
attempt
a
minute
description
of
it
the
illustrations
which
have
appeared
in
all
the
papers
have
already
acquainted
the
general
public
with
its
simple
facade
and
rows
upon
rows
of
shuttered
windows
even
the
great
square
porch
with
its
bench
for
negro
attendants
has
been
photographed
for
the
million
those
who
have
seen
the
picture
in
which
the
are
shown
flying
from
its
yawning
doorway
will
not
be
especially
interested
in
the
quiet
almost
solemn
aspect
it
presented
as
i
passed
up
the
low
steps
and
laid
my
hand
upon
the
knob
of
the
front
door
not
that
i
expected
to
win
an
entrance
thereby
but
because
it
is
my
nature
to
approach
everything
in
a
way
conceive
then
my
astonishment
when
at
the
first
touch
the
door
yielded
it
was
not
even
latched
so
so
thought
i
this
is
no
fool
job
some
one
is
in
the
house
i
had
provided
myself
with
an
ordinary
and
when
i
had
convinced
hibbard
that
i
fully
meant
to
enter
the
house
and
discover
for
myself
who
had
taken
advantage
of
the
popular
prejudice
against
it
to
make
a
secret
refuge
or
rendezvous
of
its
decayed
old
rooms
i
took
out
this
lantern
and
held
it
in
readiness
we
may
strike
a
hornets
nest
i
explained
to
hibbard
whose
feet
seemed
very
heavy
even
for
a
man
of
his
size
but
i
going
in
and
so
are
you
only
let
me
suggest
that
we
first
take
off
our
shoes
we
can
hide
them
in
these
bushes
i
always
catch
cold
when
i
walk
barefooted
mumbled
my
brave
companion
but
receiving
no
reply
he
drew
off
his
shoes
and
dropped
them
beside
mine
in
the
cluster
of
stark
bushes
which
figure
so
prominently
in
the
illustrations
that
i
have
just
mentioned
then
he
took
out
his
revolver
and
cocking
it
stood
waiting
while
i
gave
a
cautious
push
to
the
door
darkness
silence
rather
had
i
confronted
a
light
and
heard
some
noise
even
if
it
had
been
the
ominous
click
to
which
eve
are
so
well
accustomed
hibbard
seemed
to
share
my
feelings
though
from
an
entirely
different
cause
pistols
and
lanterns
are
no
good
here
he
grumbled
what
we
want
at
this
blessed
minute
is
a
priest
with
a
sprinkling
of
holy
water
and
i
for
one
he
was
actually
sliding
off
with
a
smothered
oath
i
drew
him
back
see
here
i
cried
you
not
a
babe
in
arms
come
on
or
well
what
now
he
had
clenched
my
arm
and
was
pointing
to
the
door
which
was
slowly
swaying
to
behind
us
notice
that
he
whispered
no
key
in
the
lock
men
use
keys
but
my
patience
could
stand
no
more
with
a
shake
i
rid
myself
of
his
clutch
muttering
there
go
you
too
much
of
a
fool
for
me
i
in
for
it
alone
and
in
proof
of
my
determination
i
turned
the
slide
of
the
lantern
and
flashed
the
light
through
the
house
the
effect
was
ghostly
but
while
the
fellow
at
my
side
breathed
hard
he
did
not
take
advantage
of
my
words
to
make
his
escape
as
i
half
expected
him
to
perhaps
like
myself
he
was
fascinated
by
the
dreary
spectacle
of
long
shadowy
walls
and
an
equally
shadowy
staircase
emerging
from
a
darkness
which
a
minute
before
had
seemed
impenetrable
perhaps
he
was
simply
ashamed
at
all
events
he
stood
his
ground
scrutinizing
with
rolling
eyes
that
portion
of
the
hall
where
two
columns
with
gilded
corinthian
capitals
marked
the
door
of
the
room
which
no
man
entered
without
purpose
or
passed
without
dread
doubtless
he
was
thinking
of
that
which
had
so
frequently
been
carried
out
between
those
columns
i
know
that
i
was
and
when
in
the
sudden
draft
made
by
the
open
door
some
open
draperies
hanging
near
those
columns
blew
out
with
a
sudden
swoop
and
shiver
i
was
not
at
all
astonished
to
see
him
lose
what
little
courage
had
remained
in
him
the
truth
is
i
was
startled
myself
but
i
was
able
to
hide
the
fact
and
to
whisper
back
to
him
fiercely
do
be
an
idiot
that
curtain
hides
nothing
worse
than
some
sneaking
political
refugee
or
a
gang
of
counterfeiters
maybe
i
just
like
to
put
my
hand
on
upson
and
hush
i
had
just
heard
something
for
a
moment
we
stood
breathless
but
as
the
sound
was
not
repeated
i
concluded
that
it
was
the
creaking
of
that
shutter
certainly
there
was
nothing
moving
near
us
shall
we
go
upstairs
whispered
hibbard
not
till
we
have
made
sure
that
all
is
right
down
here
a
door
stood
slightly
ajar
on
our
left
pushing
it
open
we
looked
in
a
well
furnished
parlor
was
before
us
here
where
the
wedding
took
place
remarked
hibbard
straining
his
head
over
my
shoulder
there
were
signs
of
this
wedding
on
every
side
walls
and
ceilings
had
been
hung
with
garlands
and
these
still
clung
to
the
mantelpiece
and
over
and
around
the
various
doorways
branches
and
the
remnants
of
old
bouquets
dropped
from
the
hands
of
flying
guests
littered
the
carpet
adding
to
the
general
confusion
of
overturned
chairs
and
tables
everywhere
were
evidences
of
the
haste
with
which
the
place
had
been
vacated
as
well
as
the
superstitious
dread
which
had
prevented
it
being
for
the
commonplace
purpose
of
cleaning
even
the
piano
had
not
been
shut
and
under
it
lay
some
scattered
sheets
of
music
which
had
been
left
where
they
fell
to
the
probable
loss
of
some
poor
musician
the
clock
occupying
the
center
of
the
mantelpiece
alone
gave
evidence
of
life
it
had
been
wound
for
the
wedding
and
had
not
yet
run
down
its
came
faint
enough
however
through
the
darkness
as
if
it
too
had
lost
heart
and
would
soon
lapse
into
the
deadly
quiet
of
its
ghostly
surroundings
it
it
chattered
hibbard
he
was
right
i
felt
as
if
i
were
shutting
the
lid
of
a
coffin
when
i
finally
closed
the
door
our
next
steps
took
us
into
the
rear
where
we
found
little
to
detain
us
and
then
with
a
certain
dread
fully
justified
by
the
event
we
made
for
the
door
defined
by
the
two
corinthian
columns
it
was
ajar
like
the
rest
and
call
me
coward
or
call
me
fool
i
have
called
hibbard
both
you
will
remember
i
found
that
it
cost
me
an
effort
to
lay
my
hand
on
its
mahogany
panels
danger
if
danger
there
was
lurked
here
and
while
i
had
never
known
myself
to
quail
before
any
ordinary
antagonist
i
like
others
of
my
kind
have
no
especial
fondness
for
unseen
and
mysterious
perils
hibbard
who
up
to
this
point
had
followed
me
almost
too
closely
now
accorded
me
all
the
room
that
was
necessary
it
was
with
a
sense
of
entering
alone
upon
the
scene
that
i
finally
thrust
wide
the
door
and
crossed
the
threshold
of
this
redoubtable
room
where
but
two
short
weeks
before
a
fresh
victim
had
been
added
to
the
list
of
those
who
had
by
some
unimaginable
means
found
their
death
within
its
recesses
my
first
glance
showed
me
little
save
the
ponderous
outlines
of
an
old
settle
which
jutted
from
the
corner
of
the
fireplace
half
way
out
into
the
room
as
it
was
seemingly
from
this
seat
that
the
men
who
at
various
times
had
been
found
lying
here
had
fallen
to
their
doom
a
thrill
passed
over
me
as
i
noted
its
unwieldy
bulk
and
the
deep
shadow
it
threw
on
the
ancient
and
dishonored
hearthstone
to
escape
the
ghastly
memories
it
evoked
and
also
to
satisfy
myself
that
the
room
was
really
as
empty
as
it
seemed
i
took
another
step
forward
this
caused
the
light
from
the
lantern
i
carried
to
spread
beyond
the
point
on
which
it
had
hitherto
been
so
effectively
concentrated
but
the
result
was
to
emphasize
rather
than
detract
from
the
extreme
desolation
of
the
great
room
the
settle
was
a
fixture
as
i
afterwards
found
and
was
almost
the
only
article
of
furniture
to
be
seen
on
the
wide
expanse
of
uncarpeted
floor
there
was
a
table
or
two
in
hiding
somewhere
amid
the
shadows
at
the
other
end
from
where
i
stood
and
possibly
some
kind
of
stool
or
settee
but
the
general
impression
made
upon
me
was
that
of
a
completely
dismantled
place
given
over
to
moth
and
rust
i
do
not
include
the
walls
they
were
not
bare
like
the
floor
but
covered
with
books
from
floor
to
ceiling
these
books
were
not
the
books
of
they
had
stood
so
long
in
their
places
unnoted
and
untouched
that
they
had
acquired
the
color
of
fungus
and
smelt
well
there
is
no
use
adding
to
the
picture
every
one
knows
the
spirit
of
sickening
desolation
pervading
rooms
which
have
been
shut
up
for
an
indefinite
length
of
time
from
air
and
sunshine
the
elegance
of
the
heavily
stuccoed
ceiling
admitted
to
be
one
of
the
finest
specimens
of
its
kind
in
washington
as
well
as
the
richness
of
the
carvings
ornamenting
the
mantel
of
italian
marble
rising
above
the
accursed
hearthstone
only
served
to
make
more
evident
the
extreme
neglect
into
which
the
rest
of
the
room
had
sunk
being
anything
but
anxious
to
subject
myself
further
to
its
unhappy
influence
and
quite
convinced
that
the
place
was
indeed
as
empty
as
it
looked
i
turned
to
leave
when
my
eyes
fell
upon
something
so
unexpected
and
so
extraordinary
seen
as
it
was
under
the
influence
of
the
old
tragedies
with
which
my
mind
was
necessarily
full
that
i
paused
balked
in
my
advance
and
uncertain
whether
i
looked
upon
a
real
thing
or
on
some
strange
and
terrible
fantasy
of
my
aroused
imagination
a
form
lay
before
me
outstretched
on
that
portion
of
the
floor
which
had
hitherto
been
hidden
from
me
by
the
door
a
woman
form
which
even
in
that
first
casual
look
impressed
itself
upon
me
as
one
of
aerial
delicacy
and
extreme
refinement
and
this
form
lay
as
only
the
dead
lie
the
dead
and
i
had
been
looking
at
the
hearthstone
for
just
such
a
picture
no
not
just
such
a
picture
for
this
woman
lay
face
uppermost
and
on
the
floor
beside
her
was
blood
a
hand
had
plucked
my
sleeve
it
was
hibbard
startled
by
my
immobility
and
silence
he
had
stepped
in
with
quaking
members
expecting
he
hardly
knew
what
but
no
sooner
did
his
eyes
fall
on
the
prostrate
form
which
held
me
spellbound
than
an
unforeseen
change
took
place
in
him
what
had
unnerved
me
restored
him
to
full
death
in
this
shape
was
familiar
to
him
he
had
no
fear
of
blood
he
did
not
show
surprise
at
encountering
it
but
only
at
the
effect
it
appeared
to
produce
on
me
shot
was
his
laconic
comment
as
he
bent
over
the
prostrate
body
shot
through
the
heart
she
must
have
died
before
she
fell
shot
that
was
a
new
experience
for
this
room
no
wound
had
ever
before
disfigured
those
who
had
fallen
here
nor
had
any
of
the
previous
victims
been
found
lying
on
any
other
spot
than
the
one
over
which
that
huge
settle
kept
guard
as
these
thoughts
crossed
my
mind
i
instinctively
glanced
again
toward
the
fireplace
for
what
i
almost
refused
to
believe
lay
outstretched
at
my
feet
when
nothing
more
appeared
there
than
that
old
seat
of
sinister
memory
i
experienced
a
thrill
which
poorly
prepared
me
for
the
cry
which
i
now
heard
raised
by
hibbard
look
here
what
do
you
make
of
this
he
was
pointing
to
what
upon
closer
inspection
proved
to
be
a
strip
of
white
satin
ribbon
running
from
one
of
the
delicate
wrists
of
the
girl
before
us
to
the
handle
of
a
pistol
which
had
fallen
not
far
away
from
her
side
it
looks
as
if
the
pistol
was
attached
to
her
that
is
something
new
in
my
experience
what
do
you
think
it
means
alas
there
was
but
one
thing
it
could
mean
the
shot
to
which
she
had
succumbed
had
been
delivered
by
herself
this
fair
and
delicate
creature
was
a
suicide
but
suicide
in
this
place
how
could
we
account
for
that
had
the
story
of
this
room
fame
acted
hypnotically
on
her
or
had
she
stumbled
upon
the
open
door
in
front
and
been
glad
of
any
refuge
where
her
misery
might
find
a
solitary
termination
closely
scanning
her
upturned
face
i
sought
an
answer
to
this
question
and
while
thus
seeking
received
a
fresh
shock
which
i
did
not
hesitate
to
communicate
to
my
now
companion
look
at
these
features
i
cried
i
seem
to
know
them
do
you
he
growled
out
a
dissent
but
stooped
at
my
bidding
and
gave
the
pitiful
young
face
a
pro
longed
stare
when
he
looked
up
again
it
was
with
a
puzzled
contraction
of
his
eyebrows
i
certainly
seen
it
somewhere
he
hesitatingly
admitted
edging
slowly
away
toward
the
door
perhaps
in
the
papers
is
she
like
like
i
interrupted
it
is
veronica
moore
herself
the
owner
of
this
house
and
she
who
was
married
here
two
weeks
since
to
jeffrey
evidently
her
reason
was
unseated
by
the
tragedy
which
threw
so
deep
a
gloom
over
her
wedding
iii
i
remain
not
for
an
instant
did
i
doubt
the
correctness
of
this
identification
all
the
pictures
i
had
seen
of
this
society
belle
had
been
marked
by
an
individuality
of
expression
which
fixed
her
face
in
the
memory
and
which
i
now
saw
repeated
in
the
lifeless
features
before
me
greatly
startled
by
the
discovery
but
quite
convinced
that
this
was
but
the
dreadful
sequel
of
an
already
sufficiently
dark
tragedy
i
proceeded
to
take
such
steps
as
are
common
in
these
cases
having
sent
the
hibbard
to
notify
headquarters
i
was
on
the
point
of
making
a
memorandum
of
such
details
as
seemed
important
when
my
lantern
suddenly
went
out
leaving
me
in
total
darkness
this
was
far
from
pleasant
but
the
effect
it
produced
upon
my
mind
was
not
without
its
result
for
no
sooner
did
i
find
myself
alone
and
in
the
unrelieved
darkness
of
this
room
than
i
became
convinced
that
no
woman
however
frenzied
would
make
her
plunge
into
an
unknown
existence
from
the
midst
of
a
darkness
only
too
suggestive
of
the
tomb
to
which
she
was
hastening
it
was
not
in
nature
not
in
woman
nature
at
all
events
either
she
had
committed
the
final
act
before
such
daylight
as
could
filter
through
the
shutters
of
this
room
had
quite
disappeared
an
hypothesis
instantly
destroyed
by
the
warmth
which
still
lingered
in
certain
portions
of
her
body
or
else
the
light
which
had
been
burning
when
she
pulled
the
fatal
trigger
had
since
been
carried
elsewhere
or
extinguished
recalling
the
uncertain
gleams
which
we
had
seen
flashing
from
one
of
the
upper
windows
i
was
inclined
to
give
some
credence
to
the
former
theory
but
was
disposed
to
be
fair
to
both
so
after
relighting
my
lamp
i
turned
on
one
of
the
gas
cocks
of
the
massive
chandelier
over
my
head
and
applied
a
match
the
result
was
just
what
i
anticipated
no
gas
in
the
pipes
a
meter
had
not
been
put
in
for
the
wedding
this
the
papers
had
repeatedly
stated
in
dwelling
upon
the
garish
effect
of
the
daylight
on
the
elaborate
costumes
worn
by
the
ladies
candles
had
not
even
been
provided
ah
candles
what
then
was
it
that
i
saw
glittering
on
a
small
table
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
surely
a
candlestick
or
rather
an
candelabrum
with
a
candle
in
one
of
its
sockets
hastily
crossing
to
it
i
felt
of
the
candlewick
it
was
quite
stiff
and
hard
but
not
considering
this
a
satisfactory
proof
that
it
had
not
been
lately
burning
the
tip
of
a
wick
soon
dries
after
the
flame
is
blown
out
i
took
out
my
penknife
and
attacked
the
wick
at
what
might
be
called
its
root
whereupon
i
found
that
where
the
threads
had
been
protected
by
the
wax
they
were
comparatively
soft
and
penetrable
the
conclusion
was
obvious
true
to
my
instinct
in
this
matter
the
woman
had
not
lifted
her
weapon
in
darkness
this
candle
had
been
burning
but
here
my
thoughts
received
a
fresh
shock
if
burning
then
by
whom
had
it
since
been
blown
out
not
by
her
her
wound
was
too
fatally
sure
for
that
the
steps
taken
between
the
table
where
the
candelabrum
stood
and
the
place
where
she
lay
were
taken
if
taken
at
all
by
her
before
that
shot
was
fired
some
one
else
some
one
whose
breath
still
lingered
in
the
air
about
me
had
extinguished
this
after
she
fell
and
the
death
i
looked
down
upon
was
not
a
suicide
but
a
murder
the
excitement
which
this
discovery
caused
to
tingle
through
my
every
nerve
had
its
birth
in
the
ambitious
feeling
referred
to
in
the
opening
paragraph
of
this
narrative
i
believed
that
my
opportunity
had
come
that
with
the
start
given
me
by
the
conviction
just
stated
i
should
be
enabled
to
collect
such
clues
and
establish
such
facts
as
would
lead
to
the
acceptance
of
this
new
theory
instead
of
the
apparent
one
of
suicide
embraced
by
hibbard
and
about
to
be
promulgated
at
police
headquarters
if
so
what
a
triumph
would
be
mine
and
what
a
debt
i
should
owe
to
the
crabbed
old
gentleman
whose
seemingly
fantastic
fears
had
first
drawn
me
to
this
place
realizing
the
value
of
the
opportunity
afforded
me
by
the
few
minutes
i
was
likely
to
spend
alone
on
this
scene
of
crime
i
proceeded
to
my
task
with
that
directness
and
method
which
i
had
always
promised
myself
should
characterize
my
first
success
in
detective
work
first
then
for
another
look
at
the
fair
young
victim
herself
what
a
line
of
misery
on
the
brow
what
dark
hollows
disfiguring
cheeks
otherwise
as
delicate
as
the
petals
of
a
rose
an
interesting
if
not
absolutely
beautiful
face
it
told
me
something
i
could
hardly
put
into
words
so
that
it
was
like
leaving
a
fascinating
but
unsolved
mystery
when
i
finally
turned
from
it
to
study
the
hands
each
of
which
presented
a
separate
problem
that
offered
by
the
right
wrist
you
already
know
the
long
white
ribbon
connecting
it
with
the
discharged
pistol
but
the
secret
concealed
by
the
left
while
less
startling
was
perhaps
fully
as
significant
all
the
rings
were
gone
even
the
wedding
ring
which
had
been
placed
there
such
a
short
time
before
had
she
been
robbed
there
were
no
signs
of
violence
visible
nor
even
such
disturbances
as
usually
follow
despoliation
by
a
criminal
hand
the
boa
of
delicate
black
net
which
encircled
her
neck
rose
fresh
and
intact
to
her
chin
nor
did
the
heavy
folds
of
her
rich
broadcloth
gown
betray
that
any
disturbance
had
taken
place
in
her
figure
after
its
fall
if
a
jewel
had
flashed
at
her
throat
or
earrings
adorned
her
ears
they
had
been
removed
by
a
careful
if
not
a
loving
hand
but
i
was
rather
inclined
to
think
that
she
had
entered
upon
the
scene
of
her
death
without
ornaments
such
severe
simplicity
marked
her
whole
attire
her
hat
which
was
as
plain
and
also
as
elegant
as
the
rest
of
her
clothing
lay
near
her
on
the
floor
it
had
been
taken
off
and
thrown
down
manifestly
by
an
impatient
hand
that
this
hand
was
her
own
was
evident
from
a
small
but
very
significant
fact
the
pin
which
had
held
it
to
her
hair
had
been
thrust
again
into
the
hat
no
hand
but
hers
would
have
taken
this
precaution
a
man
would
have
flung
it
aside
just
as
he
would
have
flung
the
hat
question
did
this
argue
a
natural
expectation
on
her
part
of
resuming
her
hat
or
was
the
action
the
result
of
an
unconscious
habit
having
thus
noted
all
that
was
possible
concerning
her
without
infringing
on
the
rights
of
the
coroner
i
next
proceeded
to
cast
about
for
clues
to
the
identity
of
the
person
whom
i
considered
responsible
for
the
extinguished
candle
but
here
a
great
disappointment
awaited
me
i
could
find
nothing
expressive
of
a
second
person
presence
save
a
pile
of
cigar
ashes
scattered
near
the
legs
of
a
common
kitchen
chair
which
stood
face
to
face
with
the
book
shelves
in
that
part
of
the
room
where
the
candelabrum
rested
on
a
small
table
but
these
ashes
looked
old
nor
could
i
detect
any
evidence
of
tobacco
smoke
in
the
general
mustiness
pervading
the
place
was
the
man
who
died
here
a
fortnight
since
accountable
for
these
ashes
if
so
his
unfinished
cigar
must
be
within
sight
should
i
search
for
it
no
for
this
would
take
me
to
the
hearth
and
that
was
quite
too
deadly
a
place
to
be
heedlessly
approached
besides
i
was
not
yet
finished
with
the
spot
where
i
then
stood
if
i
could
gather
nothing
satisfactory
from
the
ashes
perhaps
i
could
from
the
chair
or
the
shelves
before
which
it
had
been
placed
some
one
with
an
interest
in
books
had
sat
there
some
one
who
expected
to
spend
sufficient
time
over
these
old
tomes
to
feel
the
need
of
a
chair
had
this
interest
been
a
general
one
or
had
it
centered
in
a
particular
volume
i
ran
my
eye
over
the
shelves
within
reach
possibly
with
an
idea
of
settling
this
question
and
though
my
knowledge
of
books
is
limited
i
could
see
that
these
were
what
one
might
call
rarities
some
of
them
contained
specimens
of
black
letter
all
moldy
and
smothered
in
dust
in
others
i
saw
dates
of
publication
which
placed
them
among
volumes
dear
to
a
collector
heart
but
none
of
them
so
far
as
i
could
see
gave
any
evidence
of
having
been
lately
handled
and
anxious
to
waste
no
time
on
puerile
details
i
hastily
quitted
my
chair
and
was
proceeding
to
turn
my
attention
elsewhere
when
i
noticed
on
an
upper
shelf
a
book
projecting
slightly
beyond
the
others
instantly
my
foot
was
on
the
chair
and
the
book
in
my
hand
did
i
find
it
of
interest
yes
but
not
on
account
of
its
contents
for
they
were
pure
greek
to
me
but
because
it
lacked
the
dust
on
its
upper
edge
which
had
marked
every
other
volume
i
had
handled
this
then
was
what
had
attracted
the
unknown
to
these
shelves
this
let
me
see
if
i
can
remember
its
title
disquisition
upon
old
coastlines
pshaw
i
was
wasting
my
time
what
had
such
a
dry
compendium
as
this
to
do
with
the
body
lying
in
its
blood
a
few
steps
behind
me
or
with
the
hand
which
had
put
out
the
candle
upon
this
dreadful
deed
nothing
i
replaced
the
book
but
not
so
hastily
as
to
push
it
one
inch
beyond
the
position
in
which
i
found
it
for
if
it
had
a
tale
to
tell
then
was
it
my
business
to
leave
that
tale
to
be
read
by
those
who
understood
books
better
than
i
did
my
next
move
was
toward
the
little
table
holding
the
candelabrum
with
the
glittering
pendants
this
table
was
one
of
a
nest
standing
against
a
wall
investigation
proved
that
it
had
been
lifted
from
the
others
and
brought
to
its
present
position
within
a
very
short
space
of
time
for
the
dust
lying
thick
on
its
top
was
almost
entirely
lacking
from
the
one
which
had
been
nested
under
it
neither
had
the
candelabrum
been
standing
there
long
dust
being
found
under
as
well
as
around
it
had
her
hand
brought
it
there
hardly
if
it
came
from
the
top
of
the
mantel
toward
which
i
now
turned
in
my
course
of
investigation
i
have
already
mentioned
this
mantel
more
than
once
this
i
could
hardly
avoid
since
in
and
about
it
lay
the
heart
of
the
mystery
for
which
the
room
was
remarkable
but
though
i
have
thus
freely
spoken
of
it
and
though
it
was
not
absent
from
my
thoughts
for
a
moment
i
had
not
ventured
to
approach
it
beyond
a
certain
safe
radius
now
in
looking
to
see
if
i
might
not
lessen
this
radius
i
experienced
that
sudden
and
overwhelming
interest
in
its
every
feature
which
attaches
to
all
objects
peculiarly
associated
with
danger
i
even
took
a
step
toward
it
holding
up
my
lamp
so
that
a
stray
ray
struck
the
faded
surface
of
an
old
engraving
hanging
over
the
fireplace
it
was
the
one
in
washington
at
least
of
benjamin
franklin
at
the
court
of
france
interesting
no
doubt
in
a
general
way
but
scarcely
calculated
to
hold
the
eye
at
so
critical
an
instant
neither
did
the
shelf
below
call
for
more
than
momentary
attention
for
it
was
absolutely
bare
so
was
the
if
not
hearth
save
for
the
impenetrable
shadow
cast
over
it
by
the
huge
bulk
of
the
great
settle
standing
at
its
edge
i
have
already
described
the
impression
made
on
me
at
my
first
entrance
by
this
ancient
and
characteristic
article
of
furniture
it
was
intensified
now
as
my
eye
ran
over
the
clumsy
carving
which
added
to
the
discomfort
of
its
high
straight
back
and
as
i
smelt
the
smell
of
its
moldy
and
possibly
cushions
a
crawling
sense
of
dread
took
the
place
of
my
first
instinctive
repugnance
not
because
superstition
had
as
yet
laid
its
grip
upon
me
although
the
place
the
hour
and
the
near
and
veritable
presence
of
death
were
enough
to
rouse
the
imagination
past
the
bounds
of
the
actual
but
because
of
a
discovery
i
had
made
a
discovery
which
emphasized
the
tradition
that
all
who
had
been
found
dead
under
the
mantel
had
fallen
as
if
from
the
end
of
this
monstrous
and
patriarchal
bench
do
you
ask
what
this
discovery
was
it
can
be
told
in
a
word
this
one
end
and
only
this
end
had
been
made
comfortable
for
the
sitter
for
a
space
scarcely
wide
enough
for
one
the
seat
and
back
at
this
special
point
had
been
upholstered
with
leather
fastened
to
the
wood
with
heavy
wrought
nails
the
remaining
portion
stretched
out
bare
hard
and
inexpressibly
forbidding
to
one
who
sought
ease
there
or
even
a
moment
of
casual
rest
the
natural
inference
was
that
the
owner
of
this
quaint
piece
of
furniture
had
been
a
very
selfish
man
who
thought
only
of
his
own
comfort
but
might
he
not
have
had
some
other
reason
for
his
apparent
niggardliness
as
i
asked
myself
this
question
and
noted
how
the
long
and
embracing
arm
which
guarded
this
cushioned
retreat
was
flattened
on
top
for
the
convenient
holding
of
decanter
and
glass
feelings
to
which
i
can
give
no
name
and
which
i
had
fondly
believed
myself
proof
against
began
to
take
the
place
of
judgment
and
reason
before
i
realized
the
nature
of
my
own
impulse
or
to
what
it
was
driving
me
i
found
myself
moving
slowly
and
steadily
toward
this
formidable
seat
under
an
irresistible
desire
to
fling
myself
down
upon
these
old
cushions
and
but
here
the
creaking
of
some
shutter
possibly
the
one
i
had
seen
swaying
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
recalled
me
to
the
duties
of
the
hour
and
remembering
that
my
investigations
were
but
half
completed
and
that
i
might
be
interrupted
any
moment
by
detectives
from
headquarters
i
broke
from
the
accursed
charm
which
horrified
me
the
moment
i
escaped
it
and
quitting
the
room
by
a
door
at
the
farther
end
sought
to
find
in
some
of
the
adjacent
rooms
the
definite
traces
i
had
failed
to
discover
on
this
the
actual
scene
of
the
crime
it
was
a
dismal
search
revealing
at
every
turn
the
almost
maddened
haste
with
which
the
house
had
been
abandoned
the
especially
roused
feelings
which
were
far
from
pleasant
the
table
evidently
set
for
the
wedding
breakfast
had
been
denuded
in
such
breathless
hurry
that
the
food
had
been
tossed
from
the
dishes
and
now
lay
in
moldering
heaps
on
the
floor
the
wedding
cake
which
some
one
had
dropped
possibly
in
the
effort
to
save
it
had
been
stepped
on
and
broken
glass
crumpled
napery
and
withered
flowers
made
all
the
corners
unsightly
and
rendered
stepping
over
the
unwholesome
floors
at
once
disgusting
and
dangerous
the
pantries
opening
out
of
this
room
were
in
no
better
case
shrinking
from
the
sights
and
smells
i
found
there
i
passed
out
into
the
kitchen
and
so
on
by
a
close
and
narrow
passage
to
the
negro
quarters
clustered
in
the
rear
here
i
made
a
discovery
one
of
the
windows
in
this
long
disused
portion
of
the
house
was
not
only
unlocked
but
partly
open
but
as
i
came
upon
no
marks
showing
that
this
outlet
had
been
used
by
the
escaping
murderer
i
made
my
way
back
to
the
front
of
the
house
and
thus
to
the
stairs
communicating
with
the
upper
floor
it
was
on
the
rug
lying
at
the
foot
of
these
stairs
that
i
came
upon
the
first
of
a
dozen
or
more
burned
matches
which
lay
in
a
distinct
trail
up
the
staircase
and
along
the
floors
of
the
upper
halls
as
these
matches
were
all
burned
as
short
as
fingers
could
hold
them
it
was
evident
that
they
had
been
used
to
light
the
steps
of
some
one
seeking
refuge
above
possibly
in
the
very
room
where
we
had
seen
the
light
which
had
first
drawn
us
to
this
house
how
then
should
i
proceed
or
await
the
coming
of
the
boys
before
pushing
in
upon
a
possible
murderer
i
decided
to
proceed
fascinated
i
think
by
the
nicety
of
the
trail
which
lay
before
me
but
when
after
a
careful
following
in
the
steps
of
him
who
had
so
lately
preceded
me
i
came
upon
a
tightly
closed
door
at
the
end
of
aside
passage
i
own
that
i
stopped
a
moment
before
lifting
hand
to
it
so
much
may
lie
behind
a
tightly
closed
door
but
my
hesitation
if
hesitation
it
was
lasted
but
a
moment
my
natural
impatience
and
the
promptings
of
my
vanity
overcame
the
dictates
of
my
judgment
and
reckless
of
consequences
perhaps
disdainful
of
them
i
soon
had
the
knob
in
my
grasp
i
gave
a
slight
push
to
the
door
and
on
seeing
a
crack
of
light
leap
into
life
along
the
jamb
pushed
the
door
wider
and
wider
till
the
whole
room
stood
revealed
the
instantaneous
banging
of
a
shutter
in
one
of
its
windows
proved
the
room
to
be
the
very
one
which
we
had
seen
lighted
from
below
otherwise
all
was
still
nor
was
i
able
to
detect
in
my
first
hurried
glance
any
other
token
of
human
presence
than
a
candle
sputtering
in
its
own
grease
at
the
bottom
of
a
tumbler
placed
on
one
corner
of
an
dressing
table
this
the
one
touch
of
incongruity
in
a
room
otherwise
rich
if
not
stately
in
its
appointments
was
loud
in
its
suggestion
of
some
hidden
presence
given
to
expedients
and
reckless
of
consequences
but
of
this
presence
nothing
was
to
be
seen
not
satisfied
with
this
short
survey
survey
which
had
given
me
the
impression
of
a
spacious
chamber
fully
furnished
but
breathing
of
the
rather
than
of
the
present
and
resolved
to
know
the
worst
or
rather
to
dare
the
worst
and
be
done
with
it
i
strode
straight
into
the
center
of
the
room
and
cast
about
me
quickly
a
comprehensive
glance
which
spared
nothing
not
even
the
shadows
lurking
in
the
corners
but
no
figure
started
up
from
those
corners
nor
did
any
crouching
head
rise
into
sight
from
beyond
the
leaves
of
the
big
screen
behind
which
i
was
careful
to
look
greatly
reassured
and
indeed
quite
convinced
that
wherever
the
criminal
lurked
at
that
moment
he
was
not
in
the
same
room
with
me
i
turned
my
attention
to
my
surroundings
which
had
many
points
of
interest
foremost
among
these
was
the
big
which
occupied
a
large
space
at
my
right
i
had
never
seen
its
like
in
use
before
and
i
was
greatly
attracted
by
its
size
and
the
air
of
mystery
imparted
to
it
by
its
closely
drawn
curtains
of
faded
brocade
in
fact
this
bed
whether
from
its
appearance
or
some
occult
influence
inherent
in
it
had
a
fascination
for
me
i
hesitated
to
approach
it
yet
could
not
forbear
surveying
it
long
and
earnestly
could
it
be
possible
that
those
curtains
concealed
some
one
in
hiding
behind
them
strange
to
say
i
did
not
feel
quite
ready
to
lay
hand
on
them
and
see
a
dressing
table
laden
with
woman
fixings
and
various
articles
of
the
toilet
all
of
an
unexpected
value
and
richness
occupied
the
space
between
the
two
windows
and
on
the
floor
immediately
in
front
of
a
high
mahogany
mantel
there
lay
amid
a
number
of
empty
boxes
an
overturned
chair
this
chair
and
the
conjectures
its
position
awakened
led
me
to
look
up
at
the
mantel
with
which
it
seemed
to
be
in
some
way
connected
and
thus
i
became
aware
of
a
wan
old
drawing
hanging
on
the
wall
above
it
why
this
picture
which
was
a
totally
uninteresting
sketch
of
a
simpering
girl
face
should
have
held
my
eye
after
the
first
glance
i
can
not
say
even
now
it
had
no
beauty
even
of
the
sentimental
kind
and
very
little
if
any
meaning
its
lines
weak
at
the
best
were
nearly
obliterated
and
in
some
places
quite
faded
out
yet
i
not
only
paused
to
look
at
it
but
in
looking
at
it
forgot
myself
and
my
errand
yet
there
was
no
apparent
reason
for
the
spell
it
exerted
over
me
nor
could
i
account
in
any
way
for
the
really
superstitious
dread
which
from
this
moment
seized
me
making
my
head
move
slowly
round
with
shrinking
backward
looks
as
that
swaying
shutter
creaked
or
some
of
the
fitful
noises
which
grow
out
of
silence
in
answer
to
our
inner
expectancy
drew
my
attention
or
appalled
my
sense
to
all
appearance
there
was
less
here
than
below
to
affect
a
courage
no
inanimate
body
with
the
mark
of
the
slayer
upon
it
lent
horror
to
these
walls
yet
sensations
which
i
had
easily
overcome
in
the
library
below
clung
with
strange
insistence
to
me
here
making
it
an
effort
for
me
to
move
and
giving
to
the
unexpected
reflection
of
my
own
image
in
the
mirror
i
chanced
to
pass
a
power
to
shock
my
nerves
which
has
never
been
repeated
in
my
experience
it
may
seem
both
unnecessary
and
out
of
character
for
a
man
of
my
calling
to
acknowledge
these
chance
sensations
but
only
by
doing
so
can
i
account
for
the
minutes
which
elapsed
before
i
summoned
sufficient
to
draw
aside
the
closed
curtains
of
the
bed
and
take
the
quick
look
inside
which
my
present
doubtful
position
demanded
but
once
i
had
broken
the
spell
and
taken
the
look
just
mentioned
i
found
my
manhood
return
and
with
it
my
old
ardor
for
clues
the
bed
held
no
gaping
chattering
criminal
yet
was
it
not
quite
empty
something
lay
there
and
this
something
while
commonplace
in
itself
was
enough
out
of
keeping
with
the
place
and
hour
to
rouse
my
interest
and
awaken
my
conjectures
it
was
a
wrap
so
rich
in
quality
and
of
such
a
festive
appearance
that
it
was
astonishing
to
find
it
lying
in
a
neglected
state
in
this
crumbling
old
house
though
i
know
little
of
the
cost
of
women
garments
i
do
know
the
value
of
lace
and
this
garment
was
covered
with
it
interesting
as
was
this
find
it
was
followed
by
one
still
more
so
nestled
in
the
folds
of
the
cloak
lay
the
withered
remains
of
what
could
only
have
been
the
bridal
bouquet
unsightly
now
and
scentless
it
was
once
a
beautiful
specimen
of
the
florist
art
as
i
noted
how
the
main
bunch
of
roses
and
lilies
was
connected
by
long
satin
ribbons
to
the
lesser
clusters
which
hung
from
it
i
recalled
with
conceivable
horror
the
use
to
which
a
similar
ribbon
had
been
put
in
the
room
below
in
the
shudder
called
up
by
this
coincidence
i
forgot
to
speculate
how
a
bouquet
carried
by
the
bride
could
have
found
its
way
back
to
this
upstairs
room
when
as
all
accounts
agree
she
had
fled
from
the
parlor
below
without
speaking
or
staying
foot
the
moment
she
was
told
of
the
catastrophe
which
had
taken
place
in
the
library
that
her
wrap
should
be
lying
here
was
not
strange
but
that
the
wedding
bouquet
that
it
really
was
the
wedding
bouquet
and
that
this
was
the
room
in
which
the
bride
had
dressed
for
the
ceremony
was
apparent
to
the
most
casual
observer
but
it
became
an
established
fact
when
in
my
further
course
about
the
room
i
chanced
on
a
handkerchief
with
the
name
veronica
embroidered
in
one
corner
this
handkerchief
had
an
interest
apart
from
the
name
on
it
it
was
of
dainty
texture
and
quite
in
keeping
so
far
as
value
went
with
the
other
belongings
of
its
fastidious
owner
but
it
was
not
clean
indeed
it
was
strangely
soiled
and
this
soil
was
of
a
nature
i
did
not
readily
understand
a
woman
would
doubtless
have
comprehended
immediately
the
cause
of
the
brown
streaks
i
found
on
it
but
it
took
me
several
minutes
to
realize
that
this
bit
of
cambric
delicate
as
a
cobweb
had
been
used
to
remove
dust
to
remove
dust
dust
from
what
from
the
probably
upon
one
end
of
which
i
found
it
but
no
one
look
along
the
polished
boards
convinced
me
that
whatever
else
had
been
dusted
in
this
room
this
shelf
had
not
the
accumulation
of
days
if
not
of
months
was
visible
from
one
end
to
the
other
of
its
unrelieved
surface
save
where
the
handkerchief
had
lain
and
the
greatest
discovery
yet
where
five
clear
spots
just
to
the
left
of
the
center
showed
where
some
man
had
rested
nothing
but
the
pressure
of
fingertips
could
have
caused
just
the
appearance
presented
by
these
spots
by
scrutinizing
them
closely
i
could
even
tell
where
the
thumb
had
rested
and
at
once
foresaw
the
possibility
of
determining
by
means
of
these
marks
both
the
size
and
shape
of
the
hand
which
had
left
behind
it
so
neat
and
unmistakable
a
clue
wonderful
but
what
did
it
all
mean
why
should
a
man
rest
his
on
this
shelf
had
he
done
so
in
an
effort
to
balance
himself
for
a
look
up
the
chimney
no
for
then
the
marks
made
by
his
fingers
would
have
extended
to
the
edge
of
the
shelf
whereas
these
were
in
the
middle
of
it
their
shape
too
was
round
not
oblong
hence
the
pressure
had
come
from
above
and
ah
i
had
it
these
impressions
in
the
dust
of
the
shelf
were
just
such
as
would
be
made
by
a
person
steadying
himself
for
a
close
look
at
the
old
picture
and
this
accounted
also
for
the
overturned
chair
and
for
the
handkerchief
used
as
a
duster
some
interest
in
this
picture
had
been
greater
than
mine
some
one
who
was
either
very
or
whose
temperament
was
such
that
only
the
closest
inspection
would
satisfy
an
aroused
curiosity
this
gave
me
an
idea
or
rather
impressed
upon
me
the
necessity
of
preserving
the
outline
of
these
marks
while
they
were
still
plain
to
the
eye
taking
out
my
penknife
i
lightly
ran
the
point
of
my
sharpest
blade
around
each
separate
impression
till
i
had
fixed
them
for
all
time
in
the
well
worn
varnish
of
the
mahogany
this
done
my
thoughts
recurred
to
the
question
already
raised
what
was
there
in
this
old
picture
to
arouse
such
curiosity
in
one
bent
on
evil
if
not
fresh
from
a
hideous
crime
i
have
said
before
that
the
picture
as
a
picture
was
worthless
a
mere
faded
sketch
fit
only
for
lumbering
up
some
old
garret
then
wherein
lay
its
charm
a
charm
which
i
myself
had
felt
though
not
to
this
extent
it
was
useless
to
conjecture
a
fresh
difficulty
had
been
added
to
my
task
by
this
puzzling
discovery
but
difficulties
only
increased
my
interest
it
was
with
an
odd
feeling
of
elation
that
in
a
further
examination
of
this
room
i
came
upon
two
additional
facts
equally
odd
and
irreconcilable
one
was
the
presence
of
a
penknife
with
the
file
blade
open
on
a
small
table
under
the
window
marked
by
the
loosened
shutter
scattered
about
it
were
some
filings
which
shone
as
the
light
from
my
lantern
fell
upon
them
but
which
were
so
fine
as
to
call
for
a
to
make
them
out
the
other
was
in
connection
with
a
closet
not
far
from
the
great
bed
it
was
an
empty
closet
so
far
as
the
hooks
went
and
the
two
great
drawers
which
i
found
standing
half
open
at
its
back
but
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
lay
an
overturned
candelabrum
similar
to
the
one
below
but
with
its
prisms
scattered
and
its
one
candle
crushed
and
battered
out
of
all
shape
on
the
blackened
boards
if
upset
while
alight
the
foot
which
had
stamped
upon
it
in
a
wild
endeavor
to
put
out
the
flames
had
been
a
frenzied
one
now
by
whom
had
this
frenzy
been
shown
and
when
within
the
hour
i
could
detect
no
smell
of
smoke
at
some
former
time
then
say
on
the
day
of
the
bridal
glancing
from
the
broken
candle
at
my
feet
to
the
one
giving
its
last
sputter
in
the
tumbler
on
the
dressing
table
i
owned
myself
perplexed
surely
no
ordinary
explanation
fitted
these
extraordinary
and
seemingly
contradictory
circumstances
iv
signed
veronica
i
am
in
some
ways
hypersensitive
among
my
other
weaknesses
i
have
a
wholesome
dread
of
ridicule
and
this
is
probably
why
i
failed
to
press
my
theory
on
the
captain
when
he
appeared
and
even
forbore
to
mention
the
various
small
matters
which
had
so
attracted
my
attention
if
he
and
the
experienced
men
who
came
with
him
saw
suicide
and
nothing
but
suicide
in
this
lamentable
shooting
of
a
bride
of
two
weeks
then
it
was
not
for
me
to
suggest
a
deeper
crime
especially
as
one
of
the
latter
eyed
me
with
open
scorn
when
i
proposed
to
accompany
them
upstairs
into
the
room
where
the
light
had
been
seen
burning
no
i
would
keep
my
discoveries
to
myself
or
at
least
forbear
to
mention
them
till
i
found
the
captain
alone
asking
nothing
at
this
juncture
but
permission
to
remain
in
the
house
till
jeffrey
arrived
i
had
been
told
that
an
officer
had
gone
for
this
gentleman
and
when
i
heard
the
sound
of
wheels
in
front
i
made
a
rush
for
the
door
in
my
anxiety
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
him
but
it
was
a
woman
who
alighted
as
this
woman
was
in
a
state
of
great
agitation
one
of
the
men
hastened
down
to
offer
his
arm
as
she
took
it
i
asked
hibbard
who
had
suddenly
reappeared
upon
the
scene
who
she
was
he
said
that
she
was
probably
the
sister
of
the
woman
who
lay
inside
upon
which
i
remembered
that
this
lady
under
the
name
of
miss
tuttle
she
was
but
to
miss
moore
had
been
repeatedly
mentioned
by
the
reporters
in
the
accounts
of
the
wedding
before
mentioned
as
a
person
of
superior
attainments
and
magnificent
beauty
this
did
not
take
from
my
interest
and
flinging
decorum
to
the
winds
i
approached
as
near
as
possible
to
the
threshold
which
she
must
soon
cross
as
i
did
so
i
was
astonished
to
hear
the
strains
of
uncle
david
organ
still
pealing
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
this
at
a
moment
so
serious
and
while
matters
of
apparent
consequence
were
taking
place
in
the
house
to
which
he
had
himself
directed
the
attention
of
the
police
struck
me
as
carrying
stoicism
to
the
extreme
not
very
favorably
impressed
by
this
display
of
open
if
not
insulting
indifference
on
the
part
of
the
sole
remaining
moore
an
indifference
which
did
not
appear
quite
natural
even
in
a
man
of
his
morbid
eccentricity
i
resolved
to
know
more
of
this
old
man
and
above
all
to
make
myself
fully
acquainted
with
the
exact
relations
which
had
existed
between
him
and
his
unhappy
niece
meanwhile
miss
tuttle
had
stepped
within
the
circle
of
light
cast
by
our
lanterns
i
have
never
seen
a
finer
woman
nor
one
whose
features
displayed
a
more
emotion
this
called
for
respect
and
i
for
one
endeavored
to
show
it
by
withdrawing
into
the
background
but
i
soon
stepped
forward
again
my
desire
to
understand
her
was
too
great
the
impression
made
by
her
bearing
too
complex
to
be
passed
over
lightly
by
one
on
the
lookout
for
a
key
to
the
remarkable
tragedy
before
us
meanwhile
her
lips
had
opened
with
the
cry
my
sister
where
is
my
sister
the
captain
made
a
hurried
movement
toward
the
rear
and
then
with
the
laudable
intention
doubtless
of
preparing
her
for
the
ghastly
sight
which
awaited
her
returned
and
opened
a
way
for
her
into
the
but
she
was
not
to
be
turned
aside
from
her
course
passing
him
by
she
made
directly
for
the
library
which
she
entered
with
a
bound
struck
by
her
daring
we
all
crowded
up
behind
her
and
curious
brutes
that
we
were
grouped
ourselves
in
a
semicircle
about
the
doorway
as
she
faltered
toward
her
sister
outstretched
form
and
fell
on
her
knees
beside
it
her
involuntary
shriek
and
the
fierce
recoil
she
made
as
her
eyes
fell
on
the
long
white
ribbon
trailing
over
the
floor
from
her
sister
wrist
struck
me
as
voicing
the
utmost
horror
of
which
the
human
soul
is
capable
it
was
as
though
her
very
soul
were
pierced
something
in
the
fact
itself
something
in
the
appearance
of
this
snowy
ribbon
tied
to
the
scarce
whiter
wrist
seemed
to
pluck
at
the
very
root
of
her
being
and
when
her
glance
in
traveling
its
length
lighted
on
the
death
dealing
weapon
at
its
end
she
cringed
in
such
apparent
anguish
that
we
looked
to
see
her
fall
in
a
swoon
or
break
out
into
delirium
we
were
correspondingly
startled
when
she
suddenly
burst
forth
with
this
word
of
stern
command
untie
that
knot
why
do
you
leave
that
dreadful
thing
fast
to
her
untie
it
i
say
it
is
killing
me
i
can
not
bear
the
sight
and
from
trembling
she
passed
to
shuddering
till
her
whole
body
shook
convulsively
the
captain
with
much
consideration
drew
back
the
hand
he
had
impulsively
stretched
toward
the
ribbon
no
no
he
protested
we
can
not
do
that
we
can
do
nothing
till
the
coroner
comes
it
is
necessary
that
he
should
see
her
just
as
she
was
found
besides
jeffrey
has
a
right
to
the
same
privilege
we
expect
him
any
moment
the
beautiful
head
of
the
woman
before
us
shook
involuntarily
but
her
lips
made
no
protest
i
doubt
if
she
possessed
the
power
of
speech
at
that
moment
a
change
subtle
but
quite
perceptible
had
taken
place
in
her
emotions
at
mention
of
her
sister
husband
and
though
she
exerted
herself
to
remain
calm
the
effort
seemed
too
much
for
her
strength
anxious
to
hide
this
evidence
of
weakness
she
rose
impetuously
and
then
we
saw
how
tall
she
was
how
the
long
lines
of
her
cloak
became
her
and
what
a
glorious
creature
she
was
altogether
it
will
kill
him
she
groaned
in
a
deep
inward
voice
then
with
a
certain
forced
haste
and
in
a
tone
of
surprise
which
to
my
ear
had
not
quite
a
natural
ring
she
called
aloud
on
her
who
could
no
longer
either
listen
or
answer
oh
veronica
veronica
what
cause
had
you
for
death
and
why
do
we
find
you
lying
here
in
a
spot
you
so
feared
and
detested
do
you
know
insinuated
the
captain
with
a
mild
persuasiveness
such
as
he
was
seldom
heard
to
use
do
you
mean
that
you
can
not
account
for
your
sister
violent
end
you
who
have
lived
with
her
or
so
i
have
been
since
her
marriage
with
mr
jeffrey
yes
keen
and
clear
the
word
rang
out
fierce
in
its
keenness
and
almost
too
clear
to
be
in
keeping
with
the
half
choked
tones
with
which
she
added
i
know
that
she
was
not
happy
that
she
never
has
been
happy
since
the
shadow
which
this
room
suggests
fell
upon
her
marriage
but
how
could
i
so
much
as
dream
that
her
dread
of
the
past
or
her
fear
of
the
future
would
drive
her
to
suicide
and
in
this
place
of
all
places
had
i
done
so
had
i
imagined
in
the
least
degree
that
she
was
affected
to
this
extent
do
you
think
that
i
would
have
left
her
for
one
instant
alone
none
of
us
knew
that
she
contemplated
death
she
had
no
appearance
of
it
she
laughed
when
i
what
had
she
been
about
to
say
the
captain
seemed
to
wonder
and
after
waiting
in
vain
for
the
completion
of
her
sentence
he
quietly
suggested
you
have
not
finished
what
you
had
to
say
miss
tuttle
she
started
and
seemed
to
come
back
from
some
remote
region
of
thought
into
which
she
had
wandered
i
do
know
i
forget
she
stammered
with
a
sigh
poor
veronica
wretched
veronica
how
shall
i
ever
tell
him
how
how
can
we
ever
prepare
him
the
captain
took
advantage
of
this
reference
to
jeffrey
to
ask
where
that
gentleman
was
the
young
lady
did
not
seem
eager
to
reply
but
when
pressed
answered
though
somewhat
mechanically
that
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
say
jeffrey
had
many
friends
with
any
one
of
whom
he
might
be
enjoying
a
social
evening
but
it
is
far
past
midnight
now
remarked
the
captain
is
he
in
the
habit
of
remaining
out
late
sometimes
she
faintly
admitted
two
or
three
times
since
his
marriage
he
has
been
out
till
one
were
there
other
causes
for
the
young
bride
evident
disappointment
and
misery
besides
the
one
intimated
there
certainly
was
some
excuse
for
thinking
so
possibly
some
one
of
as
may
have
shown
his
doubts
in
this
regard
for
the
woman
before
us
suddenly
broke
forth
with
this
vehement
assertion
jeffrey
was
a
loving
husband
to
my
sister
a
very
loving
husband
she
emphasized
then
growing
desperately
pale
she
added
i
have
never
known
a
better
man
and
stopped
some
hidden
anguish
in
this
cry
some
in
this
pause
suggested
to
me
a
possibility
which
i
was
glad
to
see
ignored
by
the
captain
in
his
next
question
when
did
you
see
your
sister
last
he
asked
were
you
at
home
when
she
left
her
husband
house
alas
she
murmured
then
seeing
that
a
more
direct
answer
was
expected
of
her
she
added
with
as
little
appearance
of
effort
as
possible
i
was
at
home
and
i
heard
her
go
out
but
i
had
no
idea
that
it
was
for
any
purpose
other
than
to
join
some
social
gathering
dressed
this
way
the
captain
pointed
to
the
floor
and
her
eyes
followed
certainly
jeffrey
was
not
appareled
for
an
evening
company
as
miss
tuttle
realized
the
trap
into
which
she
had
been
betrayed
her
words
rushed
forth
and
tripped
each
other
up
i
did
not
notice
she
often
wore
black
it
became
her
my
sister
was
eccentric
worse
worse
than
useless
some
slips
can
not
be
explained
away
miss
tuttle
seemed
to
realize
that
this
was
one
of
them
for
she
paused
abruptly
with
the
words
half
finished
on
her
tongue
yet
her
attitude
commanded
respect
and
i
for
one
was
ready
to
accord
it
to
her
certainly
such
a
woman
was
not
to
be
seen
every
day
and
if
her
replies
lacked
candor
there
was
a
nobility
in
her
presence
which
gave
the
lie
to
any
doubt
at
least
that
was
the
effect
she
produced
on
me
whether
or
not
her
interrogator
shared
my
feeling
i
could
not
so
readily
determine
for
his
attention
as
well
as
mine
was
suddenly
diverted
by
the
cry
which
now
escaped
her
lips
her
watch
where
is
her
watch
it
is
gone
i
saw
it
on
her
breast
and
it
gone
it
hung
just
just
where
wait
cried
one
of
the
men
who
had
been
peering
about
the
floor
is
this
it
he
held
aloft
a
small
object
blazing
with
jewels
yes
she
gasped
trying
to
take
it
but
the
officer
gave
it
to
the
captain
instead
it
must
have
slipped
from
her
as
she
fell
remarked
the
latter
after
a
cursory
examination
of
the
glittering
trinket
the
pin
by
which
she
attached
it
to
her
dress
must
have
been
insecurely
fastened
then
quickly
and
with
a
sharp
look
at
miss
tuttle
do
you
know
if
this
was
considered
an
accurate
timepiece
yes
why
do
you
ask
is
it
look
he
held
it
up
with
the
face
toward
us
the
hands
stood
at
thirteen
minutes
past
seven
the
hour
and
the
moment
when
it
struck
the
floor
he
declared
and
consequently
the
hour
and
the
moment
when
jeffrey
fell
finished
durbin
miss
tuttle
said
nothing
only
gasped
valuable
evidence
quoth
the
captain
putting
the
watch
in
his
pocket
then
with
a
kind
look
at
her
called
forth
by
the
sight
of
her
misery
does
this
hour
agree
with
the
time
of
her
leaving
the
house
i
can
not
say
i
think
so
it
was
some
time
before
or
after
seven
i
do
remember
the
exact
minute
it
would
take
fifteen
for
her
to
walk
here
did
she
walk
i
do
not
know
i
did
see
her
leave
my
room
is
at
the
back
of
the
house
you
can
say
if
she
left
alone
or
in
the
company
of
her
husband
jeffrey
was
not
with
her
was
jeffrey
in
the
house
he
was
not
this
last
negative
was
faintly
spoken
the
captain
noticed
this
and
ventured
upon
interrogating
her
further
how
long
had
he
been
gone
her
lips
parted
she
was
deeply
agitated
but
when
she
spoke
it
was
coldly
and
with
studied
precision
jeffrey
was
not
at
home
at
all
he
has
not
been
in
all
day
not
at
home
did
his
wife
know
that
he
was
going
to
dine
out
she
said
nothing
about
it
the
captain
cut
short
his
questions
and
in
another
moment
i
understood
why
a
gentleman
was
standing
in
the
doorway
whose
face
once
seen
was
enough
to
stop
the
words
on
any
man
lips
miss
tuttle
saw
this
gentleman
almost
as
quickly
as
we
did
and
sank
with
an
involuntary
moan
to
her
knees
it
was
francis
jeffrey
come
to
look
upon
his
dead
bride
i
have
been
present
at
many
tragic
scenes
and
have
beheld
men
under
almost
every
aspect
of
grief
terror
and
remorse
but
there
was
something
in
the
face
of
this
man
at
this
dreadful
moment
that
was
quite
new
to
me
and
as
i
judge
equally
new
to
the
other
hardy
officials
about
me
to
be
sure
he
was
a
gentleman
and
a
very
one
at
that
and
it
is
but
seldom
we
have
to
do
with
any
of
his
ilk
breathlessly
we
awaited
his
first
words
not
that
he
showed
frenzy
or
made
any
display
of
the
grief
or
surprise
natural
to
the
occasion
on
the
contrary
he
was
the
quietest
person
present
and
among
all
the
emotions
his
white
face
mirrored
i
saw
no
signs
of
what
might
be
called
sorrow
yet
his
appearance
was
one
to
wring
the
heart
and
rouse
the
most
contradictory
conjectures
as
to
just
what
chord
in
his
evidently
highly
strung
nature
throbbed
most
acutely
to
the
horror
and
astonishment
of
this
appalling
end
of
so
short
a
married
life
his
eye
which
was
fixed
on
the
prostrate
body
of
his
bride
did
not
yield
up
its
secret
when
he
moved
and
came
to
where
she
lay
and
caught
his
first
sight
of
the
ribbon
and
the
pistol
attached
to
it
the
most
experienced
among
us
were
baffled
as
to
the
nature
of
his
feelings
and
thoughts
one
thing
alone
was
patent
to
all
he
had
no
wish
to
touch
this
woman
whom
he
had
so
lately
sworn
to
cherish
his
eyes
devoured
her
he
shuddered
and
strove
several
times
to
speak
and
though
kneeling
by
her
side
he
did
not
reach
forth
his
hand
nor
did
he
let
a
tear
fall
on
the
appealing
features
so
pathetically
turned
upward
as
if
to
meet
his
look
suddenly
he
leaped
to
his
feet
must
she
stay
here
he
demanded
looking
about
for
the
person
most
in
authority
the
captain
answered
by
a
question
how
do
you
account
for
her
being
here
at
all
what
explanation
have
you
as
her
husband
to
give
for
this
strange
suicide
of
your
wife
for
reply
jeffrey
who
was
an
exceptionally
handsome
man
drew
forth
a
small
slip
of
crumpled
paper
which
he
immediately
handed
over
to
the
speaker
let
her
own
words
explain
said
he
i
found
this
scrap
of
writing
in
our
upstairs
room
when
i
returned
home
she
must
have
written
it
just
before
before
a
smothered
groan
filled
up
the
break
but
it
did
not
come
from
his
lips
which
were
fixed
and
set
but
from
those
of
the
woman
who
crouched
amongst
us
did
he
catch
this
expression
of
sorrow
from
one
whose
presence
he
as
yet
had
given
no
token
of
recognizing
he
did
not
seem
to
his
eye
was
on
the
captain
who
was
slowly
reading
by
the
light
of
a
lantern
held
in
a
detective
hand
the
almost
illegible
words
which
jeffrey
had
just
said
were
his
wife
last
communication
will
they
seem
as
pathetic
to
the
eye
as
they
did
to
the
ear
in
that
room
of
awesome
memories
and
present
death
i
find
that
i
do
not
love
you
as
i
thought
i
did
i
can
not
live
knowing
this
to
be
so
i
pray
god
that
you
may
forgive
me
veronica
a
gasp
from
the
figure
in
the
corner
then
silence
we
were
glad
to
hear
the
captain
voice
again
a
woman
heart
is
a
great
mystery
he
remarked
with
a
short
glance
at
jeffrey
it
was
a
sentiment
we
could
all
echo
for
he
to
whom
she
had
alluded
in
these
few
lines
as
one
she
could
not
love
was
a
man
whom
most
women
would
consider
the
embodiment
of
all
that
was
admirable
and
attractive
that
one
woman
so
regarded
him
was
apparent
to
all
if
ever
the
heart
spoke
in
a
human
face
it
spoke
in
that
of
miss
tuttle
as
she
watched
her
sister
husband
struggling
for
composure
above
the
prostrate
form
of
her
who
but
a
few
hours
previous
had
been
the
envy
of
all
the
fashionable
young
women
in
washington
i
found
it
hard
to
fix
my
attention
on
the
next
question
interesting
and
valuable
as
every
small
detail
was
likely
to
prove
in
case
my
theory
of
this
crime
should
ever
come
to
be
looked
on
as
the
true
one
how
came
you
to
search
here
for
the
wife
who
had
written
you
this
vague
and
far
from
satisfactory
farewell
i
see
no
hint
in
these
lines
of
the
place
where
she
intended
to
take
her
life
no
no
even
this
strong
man
shrank
from
this
idea
and
showed
a
very
natural
recoil
as
his
glances
flew
about
the
room
and
finally
rested
on
the
fireside
over
which
so
repellent
a
mystery
hung
in
impenetrable
shadow
she
said
nothing
of
her
intentions
nothing
but
the
man
who
came
for
me
told
me
where
she
was
to
be
found
he
was
waiting
at
the
door
of
my
house
he
had
been
on
a
search
for
me
up
and
down
the
town
we
met
on
the
stoop
the
captain
accepted
this
explanation
without
cavil
i
was
glad
he
did
but
to
me
the
affair
showed
inconsistencies
which
i
secretly
felt
it
to
be
my
especial
duty
to
unravel
v
master
and
dog
no
further
opportunity
was
afforded
me
that
night
for
studying
the
three
leading
characters
in
the
remarkable
drama
i
saw
unfolding
before
me
a
task
was
assigned
me
by
the
captain
which
took
me
from
the
house
and
i
missed
the
next
scene
the
arrival
of
the
coroner
but
i
repaid
myself
for
this
loss
in
a
way
i
thought
justified
by
the
importance
of
my
own
theory
and
the
evident
necessity
there
was
of
collecting
each
and
every
point
of
evidence
which
could
give
coloring
to
the
charge
in
the
event
of
this
crime
coming
to
be
looked
on
at
headquarters
as
one
of
murder
observing
that
a
light
was
still
burning
in
uncle
david
domicile
i
crossed
to
his
door
and
rang
the
bell
i
was
answered
by
the
deep
and
prolonged
howl
of
a
dog
soon
cut
short
by
his
master
amiable
greeting
this
latter
was
a
surprise
to
me
i
had
heard
so
often
of
moore
churlishness
as
a
host
that
i
had
expected
some
rebuff
but
i
encountered
no
such
tokens
of
hostility
his
brow
was
smooth
and
his
smile
cheerfully
condescending
indeed
he
appeared
anxious
to
have
me
enter
and
cast
an
indulgent
look
at
rudge
whose
irrepressible
joy
at
this
break
in
the
monotony
of
his
existence
was
tinged
with
a
very
evident
dread
of
offending
his
master
interested
anew
i
followed
this
man
of
contradictory
impulses
into
the
room
toward
which
he
led
me
the
time
has
now
come
for
a
more
careful
description
of
this
peculiar
man
moore
was
tall
and
of
that
refined
spareness
of
shape
which
suggests
the
scholar
yet
he
had
not
the
scholar
eye
on
the
contrary
his
regard
was
quick
if
not
alert
and
while
it
did
not
convey
actual
malice
or
it
roused
in
the
spectator
an
uncomfortable
feeling
not
altogether
easy
to
analyze
he
wore
his
iron
gray
locks
quite
long
and
to
this
distinguishing
idiosyncrasy
as
well
as
to
his
invariable
custom
of
taking
his
dog
with
him
wherever
he
went
was
due
the
interest
always
shown
in
him
by
street
urchins
on
account
of
his
whimsicalities
he
had
acquired
the
epithet
of
uncle
david
among
them
despite
his
aristocratic
connections
and
his
gentlemanlike
bearing
his
clothes
formed
no
exception
to
the
general
air
of
individuality
which
marked
him
they
were
of
different
cut
from
those
of
other
men
and
in
this
as
in
many
other
ways
he
was
a
law
to
himself
notably
so
in
the
following
instance
he
kept
one
day
of
the
year
religiously
and
kept
it
always
in
the
same
way
long
years
before
he
had
been
blessed
with
a
wife
who
both
understood
and
loved
him
he
had
never
forgotten
this
fact
and
once
a
year
presumably
on
the
anniversary
of
her
death
it
was
his
custom
to
go
to
the
cemetery
where
she
lay
and
to
spend
the
whole
day
under
the
shadow
of
the
stone
he
had
raised
to
her
memory
no
matter
what
the
weather
no
matter
what
the
condition
of
his
own
health
he
was
always
to
be
seen
in
this
spot
at
the
hour
of
seven
leaning
against
the
shaft
on
which
his
wife
name
was
written
eating
his
supper
in
the
company
of
his
dog
it
was
a
custom
he
had
never
omitted
so
well
known
was
it
to
the
boys
and
certain
other
curious
individuals
in
the
neighborhood
that
he
never
lacked
an
audience
though
woe
betide
the
daring
foot
that
presumed
to
invade
the
precincts
of
the
lot
he
called
his
or
the
venturesome
voice
which
offered
to
raise
itself
in
gibe
or
jeer
he
had
but
to
cast
a
glance
at
rudge
and
an
avenging
rush
scattered
the
crowd
in
a
twinkling
but
he
seldom
had
occasion
to
resort
to
this
extreme
measure
for
preserving
the
peace
and
quiet
of
his
solemn
watch
as
a
rule
he
was
allowed
to
eat
his
meal
undisturbed
and
to
pass
out
unmolested
even
by
ridicule
though
his
teeth
might
still
be
busy
over
some
final
tidbit
often
the
great
tears
might
be
seen
hanging
undried
upon
his
withered
cheeks
so
much
for
one
oddity
which
may
stand
as
a
sample
of
many
others
one
glance
at
the
room
into
which
he
ushered
me
showed
why
he
cherished
so
marked
a
dislike
for
visitors
it
was
bare
to
the
point
of
discomfort
and
had
it
not
been
for
a
certain
quaintness
in
the
shape
of
the
few
articles
to
be
seen
there
i
should
have
experienced
a
decided
feeling
of
repulsion
so
pronounced
was
the
contrast
between
this
interior
and
the
polished
bearing
of
its
owner
he
i
am
sure
could
have
shown
no
more
elevated
manners
if
he
had
been
doing
the
honors
of
a
palace
the
organ
with
the
marks
of
home
construction
upon
it
was
the
only
object
visible
which
spoke
of
luxury
or
even
comfort
but
enough
of
these
possibly
uninteresting
details
i
did
not
dwell
on
them
myself
except
in
a
vague
way
and
while
waiting
for
him
to
open
the
conversation
this
he
did
as
soon
as
he
saw
that
i
had
no
intention
of
speaking
first
and
did
you
find
any
one
in
the
old
house
he
asked
keeping
him
well
under
my
eye
i
replied
with
intentional
brusqueness
she
has
gone
there
once
too
often
the
stare
he
gave
me
was
that
of
an
actor
who
feels
that
some
expression
of
surprise
is
expected
from
him
she
he
repeated
whom
can
you
possibly
mean
by
she
the
surprise
i
expressed
at
this
bold
attempt
at
ingenuousness
was
better
simulated
than
his
i
hope
you
do
know
i
exclaimed
can
you
live
directly
opposite
a
place
of
such
remarkable
associations
and
not
interest
yourself
in
who
goes
in
and
out
of
its
deserted
doors
i
do
sit
in
my
front
window
he
peevishly
returned
i
let
my
eye
roam
toward
a
chair
standing
suspiciously
near
the
very
window
he
had
designated
but
you
saw
the
light
i
suggested
i
saw
that
from
the
when
i
went
out
to
give
rudge
his
usual
five
minutes
breathing
spell
on
the
stoop
but
you
have
not
answered
my
question
whom
do
you
mean
by
she
veronica
jeffrey
i
replied
she
who
was
veronica
moore
she
has
visited
this
haunted
house
of
hers
for
the
last
time
last
time
either
he
could
not
or
would
not
understand
me
what
has
happened
to
my
niece
he
cried
rising
with
an
energy
that
displaced
the
great
dog
and
sent
him
with
hanging
head
and
trailing
tail
to
his
own
special
under
the
table
has
she
run
upon
a
ghost
in
those
dismal
apartments
you
interest
me
greatly
i
did
not
think
she
would
ever
have
the
pluck
to
visit
this
house
again
after
what
happened
at
her
wedding
she
has
had
the
pluck
i
assured
him
and
what
is
more
she
has
had
enough
of
it
not
only
to
reenter
the
house
but
to
reenter
it
alone
at
least
such
is
the
present
inference
had
you
been
blessed
with
more
curiosity
and
made
more
frequent
use
of
the
chair
so
conveniently
placed
for
viewing
the
opposite
house
you
might
have
been
in
a
position
to
correct
this
inference
it
would
help
the
police
materially
to
know
positively
that
she
had
no
companion
in
her
fatal
visit
fatal
he
repeated
running
his
finger
inside
his
neckband
which
suddenly
seemed
to
have
grown
too
tight
for
comfort
can
it
be
that
my
niece
has
been
frightened
to
death
in
that
old
place
you
alarm
me
he
did
not
look
alarmed
but
then
he
was
not
of
an
impressible
nature
yet
he
was
of
the
same
human
clay
as
the
rest
of
us
and
if
he
knew
no
more
of
this
occurrence
than
he
tried
to
make
out
could
not
be
altogether
impervious
to
what
i
had
to
say
next
you
have
a
right
to
be
alarmed
i
assented
she
was
not
frightened
to
death
yet
is
she
lying
dead
on
the
library
floor
then
with
a
glance
at
the
windows
about
me
i
added
lightly
i
take
it
that
a
delivered
over
there
could
not
be
heard
in
this
room
he
sank
rather
melodramatically
into
his
seat
yet
his
face
and
form
did
not
lose
that
sudden
assumption
of
dignity
which
i
had
observed
in
him
ever
since
my
entrance
into
the
house
i
am
overwhelmed
by
this
news
he
remarked
she
has
shot
herself
why
i
did
not
say
that
she
had
shot
herself
i
carefully
repeated
yet
the
facts
point
that
way
and
jeffrey
accepts
the
suicide
theory
without
question
ah
jeffrey
is
there
most
certainly
he
was
sent
for
at
once
and
miss
tuttle
she
came
with
him
of
course
she
came
but
not
with
him
she
is
very
fond
of
her
sister
i
must
go
over
at
once
he
cried
leaping
again
to
his
feet
and
looking
about
for
his
hat
it
is
my
duty
to
make
them
feel
at
home
in
short
to
to
put
the
house
at
their
disposal
here
he
found
his
hat
and
placed
it
on
his
head
the
property
is
mine
now
you
know
he
politely
explained
turning
with
a
keen
light
in
his
gray
eye
full
upon
me
and
overwhelming
me
with
the
grand
air
of
a
man
who
has
come
unexpectedly
into
his
own
jeffrey
father
was
my
younger
brother
the
story
is
an
old
and
long
one
and
the
property
which
in
all
justice
should
have
been
divided
between
us
went
entirely
to
him
but
he
was
a
good
fellow
in
the
main
and
saw
the
injustice
of
his
father
will
as
clearly
as
i
did
and
years
ago
made
one
on
his
own
account
bequeathing
me
the
whole
estate
in
case
he
left
no
issue
or
that
issue
died
veronica
was
his
only
child
veronica
has
died
therefore
the
old
house
is
mine
and
all
that
goes
with
it
all
that
goes
with
it
there
was
the
miser
gloating
in
this
repetition
of
a
phrase
sufficiently
expressive
in
itself
or
rather
the
gloating
of
a
man
who
sees
himself
suddenly
rich
after
a
life
of
poverty
there
was
likewise
a
callousness
as
regarded
his
niece
surprising
death
which
i
considered
myself
to
have
some
excuse
for
noticing
you
accept
her
death
very
calmly
i
remarked
probably
you
knew
her
to
be
possessed
of
an
erratic
mind
he
was
about
to
bestow
an
admonitory
kick
on
his
dog
who
had
been
indiscreet
enough
to
rise
at
his
master
first
move
but
his
foot
stopped
in
mid
air
in
his
anxiety
to
concentrate
all
his
attention
on
his
answer
i
am
a
man
of
few
sentimentalities
he
coldly
averred
i
have
loved
but
one
person
in
my
whole
life
why
then
should
i
be
expected
to
mourn
over
a
niece
who
did
not
care
enough
for
me
to
invite
me
to
her
wedding
it
would
be
an
affectation
unworthy
the
man
who
has
at
last
come
to
fill
his
rightful
position
in
this
community
as
the
owner
of
the
great
moore
estate
for
great
it
shall
be
he
emphatically
continued
in
three
years
you
will
not
know
the
house
over
yonder
despite
its
fancied
ghosts
and
fireplace
it
will
stand
a
number
one
in
washington
i
david
moore
promise
you
this
and
i
am
not
a
man
to
utter
fatuous
prophecies
but
i
must
be
missed
over
there
here
he
gave
the
mastiff
the
long
delayed
kick
rudge
stay
here
the
vestibule
opposite
is
icy
besides
your
howls
are
not
wanted
in
those
old
walls
tonight
even
if
you
would
go
with
me
which
i
doubt
he
has
never
been
willing
to
cross
to
that
side
of
the
street
the
old
gentleman
went
on
to
complain
with
his
first
show
of
irritation
but
he
have
to
overcome
that
prejudice
soon
even
if
i
have
to
tear
up
the
old
hearthstone
and
reconstruct
the
walls
i
ca
live
without
rudge
and
i
will
not
live
in
any
other
place
than
in
the
old
home
of
my
ancestors
i
was
by
this
time
following
him
out
you
have
failed
to
answer
the
suggestion
i
made
you
a
minute
since
i
hazarded
will
you
pardon
me
if
i
put
it
now
as
a
question
your
niece
jeffrey
seemed
to
have
everything
in
the
world
to
make
her
happy
yet
she
took
her
life
was
there
a
taint
of
insanity
in
her
blood
or
was
her
nature
so
impulsive
that
her
astonishing
death
in
so
revolting
a
place
should
awaken
in
you
so
little
wonder
a
gleam
of
what
had
made
him
more
or
less
feared
by
the
very
urchins
who
dogged
his
steps
and
made
sport
of
him
at
a
respectful
distance
shot
from
his
eye
as
he
glowered
back
at
me
from
the
open
door
but
he
hastily
suppressed
this
sign
of
displeasure
and
replied
with
the
faintest
tinge
of
sarcasm
there
you
are
expecting
from
me
feelings
which
belong
to
youth
or
to
men
of
much
more
heart
than
understanding
i
tell
you
that
i
have
no
feelings
my
niece
may
have
developed
insanity
or
she
may
simply
have
drunk
her
cup
of
pleasure
dry
at
and
come
to
its
dregs
prematurely
i
do
not
know
and
i
do
not
care
what
concerns
me
is
that
the
responsibility
of
a
large
fortune
has
fallen
upon
me
most
unexpectedly
and
that
i
have
pride
enough
to
wish
to
show
myself
capable
of
sustaining
the
burden
besides
they
may
be
tempted
to
do
some
mischief
to
the
walls
or
floors
over
there
the
police
respect
no
man
property
but
i
am
determined
they
shall
respect
mine
no
rippings
up
or
tearings
down
will
i
allow
unless
i
stand
by
to
supervise
the
job
i
am
master
of
the
old
homestead
now
and
i
mean
to
show
it
and
with
a
last
glance
at
the
dog
who
uttered
the
most
mournful
of
protests
in
reply
he
shut
the
front
door
and
betook
himself
to
the
other
side
of
the
street
as
i
noticed
his
assured
bearing
as
he
disappeared
within
the
forbidding
portal
which
according
to
his
own
story
had
for
so
long
a
time
been
shut
against
him
i
asked
myself
if
the
candle
which
i
had
noticed
lying
on
his
was
of
the
same
make
and
size
as
those
i
had
found
in
my
late
investigations
in
the
house
he
was
then
entering
vi
gossip
next
morning
the
city
was
in
a
blaze
of
excitement
all
the
burning
questions
of
the
hour
the
rapid
mobilization
of
the
army
and
the
prospect
of
a
speedy
advance
on
cuba
were
forgotten
in
the
one
engrossing
topic
of
young
jeffrey
death
and
the
awful
circumstances
surrounding
it
nothing
else
was
in
any
one
mouth
and
but
little
else
in
any
one
heart
her
youth
her
prominence
her
union
with
a
man
of
such
marked
attractions
as
jeffrey
the
tragedy
connected
with
her
marriage
thrown
now
into
shadow
by
the
still
more
poignant
tragedy
which
had
so
suddenly
terminated
her
own
life
gave
to
the
affair
an
interest
which
for
those
first
hours
did
not
call
for
any
further
heightening
by
a
premature
suggestion
of
murder
though
i
was
the
hero
of
the
hour
and
as
such
subjected
to
an
infinite
number
of
questions
i
followed
the
lead
of
my
superiors
in
this
regard
and
carefully
refrained
from
advancing
any
theories
beyond
the
obvious
one
of
suicide
the
moment
for
was
not
ripe
i
did
not
stand
high
enough
in
the
confidence
of
the
major
or
i
may
say
of
the
lieutenant
of
my
own
precinct
to
risk
the
triumph
i
anticipated
ultimately
by
a
premature
expression
of
opinion
i
had
an
enemy
at
headquarters
or
rather
one
of
the
men
there
had
always
appeared
peculiarly
interested
in
showing
me
up
in
the
worst
light
the
name
of
this
man
was
durbin
and
it
was
he
who
had
uttered
something
like
a
slighting
remark
when
on
that
first
night
i
endeavored
to
call
the
captain
attention
to
some
of
the
small
matters
which
had
offered
themselves
to
me
in
the
light
of
clues
perhaps
it
was
the
prospect
of
surprising
him
some
day
which
made
me
so
wary
now
as
well
as
so
alert
to
fill
my
mind
with
all
known
facts
concerning
the
jeffreys
one
of
my
first
acts
was
to
turn
over
the
files
of
the
star
and
reread
the
following
account
of
the
great
wedding
as
it
is
a
sensational
description
of
a
sensational
event
i
shall
make
no
apology
for
the
headlines
which
startled
all
washington
the
night
they
appeared
startling
termination
of
the
wedding
the
traditional
doom
follows
the
opening
of
the
old
house
on
waverley
avenue
one
of
the
guests
found
lying
dead
on
the
library
hearthstone
letters
in
his
pocket
show
him
to
have
been
one
pfeiffer
of
denver
no
interruption
to
the
ceremony
follows
this
ghastly
discovery
but
the
guests
fly
in
all
directions
as
soon
as
the
nuptial
knot
is
tied
the
festivities
attendant
upon
the
wedding
of
miss
veronica
moore
to
francis
jeffrey
of
this
city
met
with
a
startling
check
as
most
of
our
readers
know
the
house
on
waverley
avenue
which
for
nearly
a
century
has
been
in
possession
of
the
family
was
opened
for
the
occasion
at
the
express
wish
of
the
bride
for
a
week
the
preparations
for
this
great
function
have
been
going
on
when
at
an
early
hour
this
morning
a
line
of
carriages
drew
up
in
front
of
the
historic
mansion
and
the
bridal
party
entered
under
its
once
gloomy
but
now
seemingly
triumphant
portal
the
crowds
which
blocked
the
street
from
curb
to
curb
testified
to
the
interest
felt
by
the
citizens
of
washington
in
this
daring
attempt
to
brave
the
traditions
which
have
marked
this
house
out
as
solitary
and
by
a
scene
of
joyous
festivity
make
the
past
forgotten
and
restore
again
to
usefulness
the
decayed
grandeurs
of
an
earlier
time
as
miss
moore
is
one
of
washington
most
charming
women
and
as
this
romantic
effort
naturally
lent
an
extraordinary
interest
to
the
ceremony
of
her
marriage
a
large
number
of
our
representative
people
assembled
to
witness
it
and
by
high
noon
the
scene
was
one
of
unusual
brilliancy
halls
which
had
moldered
away
in
an
unbroken
silence
for
years
echoed
again
with
laughter
and
palpitated
to
the
choicest
strains
of
the
marine
band
all
doors
were
open
save
those
of
the
library
an
exception
which
added
a
pleasing
excitement
to
the
occasion
and
when
by
chance
some
of
the
more
youthful
guests
were
caught
peering
behind
the
two
corinthian
pillars
guarding
these
forbidden
precincts
the
memories
thus
evoked
were
momentary
and
the
shadow
soon
passed
the
wedding
had
been
set
for
high
noon
and
as
the
clock
in
the
struck
the
hour
every
head
was
craned
to
catch
the
first
glimpse
of
the
bride
coming
down
the
staircase
but
five
minutes
ten
minutes
a
passed
without
this
expectation
being
gratified
the
crowd
above
and
below
was
growing
restless
when
suddenly
a
cry
was
heard
from
beyond
the
gilded
pillars
framing
the
library
door
and
a
young
lady
was
seen
rushing
from
the
forbidden
quarter
trembling
with
dismay
and
white
with
horror
it
was
miss
abbott
of
stratford
circle
who
in
the
interim
of
waiting
had
allowed
her
curiosity
to
master
her
dread
and
by
one
peep
into
the
room
which
seemed
to
exercise
over
her
the
fascination
of
a
bluebeard
chamber
discovered
the
outstretched
form
of
a
man
lying
senseless
and
apparently
dead
on
the
edge
of
the
hearthstone
the
terror
which
instantly
spread
amongst
the
guests
shows
the
hold
which
superstition
has
upon
all
classes
of
humanity
happily
however
an
unseemly
panic
was
averted
by
the
necessity
which
all
felt
of
preserving
some
sort
of
composure
till
the
ceremony
for
which
they
had
assembled
had
been
performed
for
simultaneously
with
this
discovery
of
death
in
the
library
there
had
come
from
above
the
sound
of
the
approaching
bridal
procession
and
cries
were
hushed
and
beating
hearts
restrained
as
miss
moore
charming
face
and
exquisite
figure
appeared
between
the
rows
of
flowering
plants
with
which
the
staircase
was
lined
no
need
for
the
murmur
to
go
about
the
bride
let
nothing
but
cheer
surround
her
till
she
is
jeffrey
wife
the
look
of
joy
which
irradiated
her
countenance
and
gave
a
aspect
to
her
whole
exquisite
person
would
have
deterred
the
most
careless
and
person
there
from
casting
a
shadow
across
her
pathway
one
minute
sooner
than
necessity
demanded
the
richness
of
the
ancestral
veil
which
covered
her
features
and
the
natural
timidity
which
prevents
a
bride
from
lifting
her
eyes
from
the
floor
she
traverses
saved
her
from
observing
the
strange
looks
by
which
her
presence
was
hailed
she
was
consequently
enabled
to
go
through
the
ceremony
in
happy
unconsciousness
of
the
forced
restraint
which
held
that
surging
mass
together
but
the
bridesmaids
were
not
so
happy
miss
tuttle
especially
held
herself
upright
simply
by
the
exercise
of
her
will
and
though
resplendent
in
suffered
so
much
in
her
anxiety
for
the
bride
that
it
was
a
matter
of
small
surprise
when
she
fainted
at
the
conclusion
of
the
ceremony
jeffrey
showed
more
composure
but
the
inward
excitement
under
which
he
was
laboring
made
him
trip
more
than
once
in
his
responses
as
many
there
noted
whose
minds
were
not
fixed
too
strongly
on
flight
only
doctor
auchincloss
was
quite
himself
and
by
means
of
the
solemnity
with
which
he
invested
his
words
kept
the
hubbub
down
which
was
already
making
itself
heard
on
the
outskirts
of
the
crowd
but
even
his
influence
did
not
prevail
beyond
the
moment
devoted
to
the
benediction
once
the
sacred
words
were
said
such
a
stampede
followed
that
the
bride
showed
much
alarm
and
it
was
left
for
jeffrey
to
explain
to
her
the
cause
of
this
astonishing
conduct
on
the
part
of
her
guests
she
bore
the
disclosure
well
all
things
considered
and
once
she
was
fully
assured
that
the
unhappy
man
whose
sudden
death
had
thus
interrupted
the
festivities
was
an
intruder
upon
the
scene
and
quite
unknown
not
only
to
herself
but
to
her
husband
she
brightened
perceptibly
though
like
every
one
around
her
she
seemed
anxious
to
leave
the
house
and
indeed
did
so
as
soon
as
miss
tuttle
condition
warranted
it
the
fact
that
the
bride
went
through
the
ceremony
without
her
bridal
bouquet
is
looked
upon
by
many
as
an
unfavorable
omen
in
her
anxiety
not
to
impose
any
longer
upon
the
patience
of
her
guests
she
had
descended
without
it
as
to
the
deceased
but
little
is
known
of
him
letters
found
on
his
person
prove
his
name
to
be
pfeiffer
and
his
residence
denver
his
presence
in
miss
moores
house
at
a
time
so
inopportune
is
unexplained
no
such
name
is
on
the
list
of
wedding
guests
nor
was
he
recognized
as
one
of
miss
moore
friends
either
by
jeffrey
or
by
such
of
her
relatives
and
acquaintances
as
had
the
courage
to
enter
the
library
to
see
him
with
the
exception
of
the
discolored
mark
on
his
temple
showing
where
his
head
had
come
in
contact
with
the
hearthstone
his
body
presents
an
appearance
of
natural
robustness
which
makes
his
sudden
end
seem
all
the
more
shocking
his
name
has
been
found
registered
at
the
national
hotel
turning
over
the
files
i
next
came
upon
the
following
despatch
from
denver
the
sudden
death
in
washington
of
wallace
pfeiffer
one
of
our
best
known
and
most
respected
citizens
is
deeply
deplored
by
all
who
knew
him
and
his
unfortunate
mother
he
is
the
last
of
her
three
sons
all
of
whom
have
died
within
the
year
the
demise
of
wallace
leaves
her
entirely
unprovided
for
it
was
not
known
here
that
pfeiffer
intended
to
visit
washington
he
was
supposed
to
go
in
quite
the
opposite
direction
having
said
to
more
than
one
that
he
had
business
in
san
francisco
his
intrusion
into
the
house
of
miss
moore
during
the
celebration
of
a
marriage
in
which
he
could
have
taken
no
personal
interest
is
explained
in
the
following
manner
by
such
as
knew
his
mental
peculiarities
though
a
merchant
by
trade
and
latterly
a
miner
in
the
klondike
he
had
great
interest
in
the
occult
and
was
a
strong
believer
in
all
kinds
of
supernatural
manifestations
he
may
have
heard
of
the
unhappy
reputation
attaching
to
the
moore
house
in
washington
and
fascinated
by
the
mystery
involved
embraced
the
opportunity
afforded
by
open
doors
and
the
general
confusion
incident
to
so
large
a
gathering
to
enter
the
interesting
old
place
and
investigate
for
himself
the
fatal
library
the
fact
of
his
having
been
found
secluded
in
this
very
room
at
a
moment
when
every
other
person
in
the
house
was
pushing
forward
to
see
the
bride
lends
color
to
this
supposition
and
his
sudden
death
under
circumstances
tending
to
rouse
the
imagination
shows
the
extreme
sensitiveness
of
his
nature
he
will
be
buried
here
the
next
paragraph
was
short
fresher
events
were
already
crowding
this
wonder
to
the
wall
verdict
in
the
case
of
wallace
pfeiffer
found
lying
dead
on
the
hearthstone
of
the
old
moore
house
library
concussion
of
the
brain
preceded
by
mental
shock
or
heart
failure
the
body
went
on
to
denver
and
below
separated
by
the
narrowest
of
spaces
and
francis
jeffrey
have
decided
to
give
up
their
wedding
tour
and
spend
their
honeymoon
in
washington
they
will
occupy
the
ransome
house
on
k
street
the
last
paragraph
brought
me
back
to
the
question
then
troubling
my
mind
was
it
in
the
household
of
this
newly
married
pair
and
in
the
possible
secret
passions
underlying
their
union
that
one
should
look
for
the
cause
of
the
murderous
crime
i
secretly
imagined
to
be
hidden
behind
this
seeming
suicide
or
were
these
parties
innocent
and
old
david
moore
the
one
motive
power
in
precipitating
a
tragedy
the
result
of
which
had
been
to
enrich
him
and
impoverish
them
certainly
a
most
serious
and
important
question
and
one
which
any
man
might
be
pardoned
for
attempting
to
answer
especially
if
that
man
was
a
young
detective
lamenting
his
obscurity
and
dreaming
of
a
recognition
which
would
yield
him
fame
and
the
wherewithal
to
marry
a
certain
clever
but
mischievous
little
minx
of
whom
you
are
destined
to
hear
more
but
how
was
that
same
young
detective
hampered
as
he
was
and
held
in
thrall
by
a
fear
of
ridicule
and
a
total
lack
of
record
to
get
the
chance
to
push
an
inquiry
requiring
opportunities
which
could
only
come
by
special
favor
this
was
what
i
continually
asked
myself
and
always
without
result
true
i
might
approach
the
captain
or
the
major
with
my
story
of
the
marks
i
had
discovered
in
the
dust
covering
the
southwest
chamber
and
if
fortunate
enough
to
find
that
these
had
been
passed
over
by
the
other
detectives
seek
to
gain
a
hearing
thereby
and
secure
for
myself
the
privileges
i
so
earnestly
desired
but
my
egotism
was
such
that
i
wished
to
be
sure
of
the
hand
which
had
made
these
marks
before
i
parted
with
a
secret
which
once
told
would
make
or
mar
me
yet
to
obtain
the
slight
concession
of
an
interview
with
any
of
the
principals
connected
with
this
crime
would
be
difficult
without
the
aid
of
one
or
both
of
my
superiors
even
to
enter
the
house
again
where
but
a
few
hours
before
i
had
made
myself
so
thoroughly
at
home
would
require
a
certain
amount
of
pluck
for
durbin
had
been
installed
there
and
durbin
was
a
whose
bite
as
well
as
his
bark
i
regarded
with
considerable
respect
yet
into
that
house
i
must
sooner
or
later
go
if
only
to
determine
whether
or
not
i
had
been
alone
in
my
recognition
of
certain
clues
pointing
plainly
toward
murder
should
i
trust
my
lucky
star
and
remain
for
the
nonce
quiescent
this
seemed
a
wise
suggestion
and
i
decided
to
adopt
it
comforting
myself
with
the
thought
that
if
after
a
day
or
two
of
modest
waiting
i
failed
in
obtaining
what
i
wished
i
could
then
appeal
to
the
lieutenant
of
my
own
precinct
he
i
had
sometimes
felt
assured
did
not
regard
me
with
an
altogether
unfavorable
eye
meantime
i
spent
all
my
available
time
in
loitering
around
newspaper
offices
and
picking
up
such
stray
bits
of
gossip
as
were
offered
as
no
question
had
yet
been
raised
of
any
more
serious
crime
than
suicide
these
mostly
related
to
the
idiosyncrasies
of
the
moore
family
and
the
solitary
position
into
which
miss
tuttle
had
been
plunged
by
this
sudden
death
of
her
only
relative
as
this
beautiful
and
distinguished
young
woman
had
been
and
still
was
a
great
belle
in
her
special
circle
her
present
homeless
if
not
penniless
position
led
to
many
surmises
would
she
marry
and
if
so
to
which
of
the
many
wealthy
or
prominent
men
who
had
openly
courted
her
would
she
accord
her
hand
in
the
present
egotistic
state
of
my
mind
i
secretly
flattered
myself
that
i
was
right
in
concluding
that
she
would
say
yes
to
no
man
entreaty
till
a
certain
widower
year
of
mourning
had
expired
but
this
opinion
received
something
of
a
check
when
in
a
quiet
talk
with
a
reporter
i
learned
that
it
was
openly
stated
by
those
who
had
courage
to
speak
that
the
tie
which
had
certainly
existed
at
one
time
between
jeffrey
and
the
handsome
miss
tuttle
had
been
entirely
of
her
own
weaving
and
that
the
person
of
veronica
moore
rather
than
the
large
income
she
commanded
had
been
the
attractive
power
which
had
led
him
away
from
the
older
sister
this
seemed
improbable
for
the
charms
of
the
poor
little
bride
were
not
to
be
compared
with
those
of
her
maturer
sister
yet
as
we
all
know
there
are
other
attractions
than
those
offered
by
beauty
i
have
since
heard
it
broadly
stated
that
the
peculiar
twitch
of
the
lip
observable
in
all
the
moores
had
proved
an
irresistible
charm
in
the
unfortunate
veronica
making
her
a
radiant
image
when
she
laughed
this
was
by
no
means
a
rare
occurrence
so
they
said
before
the
fancy
took
her
to
be
married
in
the
home
of
her
ancestors
the
few
lines
of
attempted
explanation
which
she
had
left
behind
for
her
husband
seemed
to
impose
on
no
one
to
those
who
knew
the
young
couple
well
it
was
an
open
proof
of
her
insanity
to
those
who
knew
them
slightly
as
well
as
to
the
public
at
large
it
was
a
woman
way
of
expressing
the
disappointment
she
felt
in
her
husband
that
i
might
the
more
readily
determine
which
of
these
two
theories
had
the
firmest
basis
in
fact
i
took
advantage
of
an
afternoon
off
and
slipped
away
to
alexandria
where
i
had
been
told
jeffrey
had
courted
his
bride
i
wanted
a
taste
of
local
gossip
you
see
and
i
got
it
the
air
was
fully
charged
with
it
and
being
careful
not
to
rouse
antagonism
by
announcing
myself
a
detective
i
readily
picked
up
many
small
facts
brought
into
shape
and
arranged
in
the
form
of
a
narrative
the
result
was
as
follows
john
judson
moore
the
father
of
veronica
had
fewer
oddities
than
the
other
members
of
this
eccentric
family
it
was
thought
however
that
he
had
shown
some
strain
of
the
peculiar
independence
of
his
race
when
in
selecting
a
wife
he
let
his
choice
fall
on
a
widow
who
was
not
only
encumbered
with
a
child
but
who
was
generally
regarded
as
the
plainest
woman
in
virginia
he
who
might
have
had
the
pick
of
southern
beauty
but
when
in
the
course
of
time
this
despised
woman
proved
to
be
the
possessor
of
those
virtues
and
social
graces
which
eminently
fitted
her
to
conduct
the
large
establishment
of
which
she
had
been
made
mistress
he
was
forgiven
his
lack
of
taste
little
more
was
said
of
his
peculiarities
until
his
wife
having
died
and
his
child
proved
weakly
he
made
the
will
in
his
brother
favor
which
has
since
given
that
gentleman
such
deep
satisfaction
why
this
proceeding
should
have
been
so
displeasing
to
their
friends
report
says
not
but
that
it
was
so
is
evident
from
the
fact
that
great
rejoicing
took
place
on
all
sides
when
veronica
suddenly
developed
into
a
healthy
child
and
the
probability
of
david
inheriting
the
coveted
estate
decreased
to
a
minimum
it
was
not
a
long
rejoicing
however
for
john
judson
followed
his
wife
to
the
grave
before
veronica
had
reached
her
tenth
year
leaving
her
and
her
cora
to
the
guardianship
of
a
crabbed
old
bachelor
who
had
been
his
father
lawyer
this
lawyer
was
morose
and
peevish
but
he
was
never
positively
unkind
for
two
years
the
sisters
seemed
happy
enough
when
suddenly
and
somewhat
peremptorily
they
were
separated
veronica
being
sent
to
a
western
school
where
she
remained
seemingly
without
a
single
visit
east
till
she
was
seventeen
during
this
long
absence
miss
tuttle
resided
in
washington
developing
under
masters
into
an
accomplished
woman
veronica
guardian
severe
in
his
treatment
of
the
youthful
owner
of
the
large
fortune
of
which
he
had
been
made
sole
executor
was
unexpectedly
generous
to
the
penniless
sister
hoping
perhaps
in
his
close
peevish
old
heart
that
the
charms
and
acquired
graces
of
this
lovely
woman
would
soon
win
for
her
a
husband
in
the
brilliant
set
in
which
she
naturally
found
herself
but
cora
tuttle
was
not
easy
to
please
and
the
first
men
of
washington
came
and
went
before
her
eyes
without
awakening
in
her
any
special
interest
till
she
met
francis
jeffrey
who
stole
her
heart
with
a
look
those
who
remember
her
that
winter
say
that
under
his
influence
she
developed
from
a
handsome
woman
into
a
lovely
one
yet
no
engagement
was
announced
and
society
was
wondering
what
held
francis
jeffrey
back
from
so
great
a
prize
when
veronica
moore
came
home
and
the
question
was
forever
answered
veronica
was
now
nearly
eighteen
and
during
her
absence
had
blossomed
into
womanhood
she
was
not
as
beautiful
as
her
sister
but
she
had
a
bright
and
pleasing
expression
with
enough
spice
in
her
temperament
to
rob
her
girlish
features
of
insipidity
and
make
her
conversation
witty
if
not
brilliant
yet
when
francis
jeffrey
turned
his
attentions
from
miss
tuttle
and
fixed
them
without
reserve
or
seeming
shame
upon
this
pretty
butterfly
but
one
term
could
be
found
to
characterize
the
proceeding
and
that
was
fortune
hunting
of
small
but
settled
income
he
had
hitherto
shown
a
certain
contentment
with
his
condition
calculated
to
inspire
respect
and
make
his
attentions
to
miss
tuttle
seem
both
consistent
and
appropriate
but
no
sooner
did
veronica
bright
eyes
appear
than
he
fell
at
the
young
heiress
feet
and
pressed
his
suit
so
close
and
fast
that
in
two
months
they
were
engaged
and
at
the
end
of
the
married
with
the
disastrous
consequences
just
made
known
so
much
for
the
general
gossip
of
the
town
now
for
the
special
a
certain
gentleman
whom
it
is
unnecessary
to
name
had
been
present
at
one
critical
instant
in
the
lives
of
these
three
persons
he
was
not
a
scandalmonger
and
if
everything
had
gone
on
happily
if
veronica
had
lived
and
cora
settled
down
into
matrimony
he
would
never
have
mentioned
what
he
heard
and
saw
one
night
in
the
great
of
a
hotel
in
atlantic
city
it
was
at
the
time
when
the
engagement
was
first
announced
between
jeffrey
and
the
young
heiress
this
and
his
previous
attentions
to
cora
had
made
much
talk
both
in
washington
and
elsewhere
and
there
were
not
lacking
those
who
had
openly
twitted
him
for
his
seeming
inconstancy
this
had
been
over
the
cups
of
course
and
jeffrey
had
borne
it
well
enough
from
his
friends
and
intimates
but
when
on
a
certain
evening
in
the
parlor
of
one
of
the
large
hotels
in
atlantic
city
a
fellow
whom
nobody
knew
and
nobody
liked
accused
him
of
knowing
on
which
side
his
bread
was
buttered
and
that
certainly
it
was
not
on
the
side
of
beauty
and
superior
attainments
jeffrey
got
angry
heedless
of
who
might
be
within
hearing
he
spoke
up
very
plainly
in
these
words
you
are
all
of
a
kind
rank
and
or
you
would
not
be
so
ready
to
see
greed
in
my
admiration
for
miss
moore
disagreeable
as
i
find
it
to
air
my
sentiments
in
this
public
manner
yet
since
you
provoke
me
to
it
i
will
say
once
and
for
all
that
i
am
deeply
in
love
with
miss
moore
and
that
it
is
for
this
reason
only
i
am
going
to
marry
her
were
she
the
penniless
girl
her
sister
is
and
miss
tuttle
the
proud
possessor
of
the
wealth
which
in
your
eyes
confers
such
distinction
upon
miss
moore
you
would
still
see
me
at
the
latter
feet
and
at
hers
only
miss
tuttle
charms
are
not
potent
enough
to
hold
the
heart
which
has
once
been
fixed
by
her
sister
smile
this
was
pointed
enough
certainly
but
when
at
the
conclusion
of
his
words
a
tall
figure
rose
from
a
year
corner
and
cora
tuttle
passed
the
amazed
group
with
a
bow
i
dare
warrant
that
not
one
of
the
men
composing
it
but
wished
himself
a
hundred
miles
away
jeffrey
himself
was
chagrined
and
made
a
move
to
follow
the
woman
he
had
so
publicly
scorned
but
the
look
she
cast
back
at
him
was
one
to
remember
and
he
hesitated
what
was
there
left
for
him
to
say
or
even
to
do
the
avowal
had
been
made
in
all
its
bald
frankness
and
nothing
could
alter
it
as
for
her
she
behaved
beautifully
and
by
no
word
or
look
so
far
as
the
world
knew
ever
showed
that
her
woman
pride
if
not
her
heart
had
been
cut
to
the
quick
by
the
one
man
she
adored
with
this
incident
filling
my
mind
i
returned
to
washington
i
had
acquainted
myself
with
the
open
facts
of
this
family
history
but
what
of
its
inner
life
who
knew
it
did
any
one
even
the
man
who
confided
to
me
the
contretemps
in
the
hotel
parlor
could
not
be
sure
what
underlay
jeffrey
warm
advocacy
of
the
woman
he
had
elected
to
marry
he
could
not
even
be
certain
that
he
had
really
understood
the
feeling
shown
by
cora
tuttle
when
she
heard
the
man
who
had
once
lavished
attentions
on
her
express
in
this
public
manner
a
preference
for
her
sister
a
woman
has
great
aptness
in
concealing
a
mortal
hurt
and
from
what
i
had
seen
of
this
one
i
thought
it
highly
improbable
that
all
was
quiet
in
her
passionate
breast
because
she
had
turned
an
impassive
front
to
the
world
i
was
becoming
confused
in
the
maze
of
my
own
imaginings
to
escape
the
results
of
this
confusion
i
determined
to
drop
theory
and
confine
myself
to
facts
and
thus
passed
the
first
few
days
succeeding
the
tragic
discovery
in
the
moore
house
vii
sly
work
the
next
morning
my
duty
led
me
directly
in
the
way
of
that
little
friend
of
mine
whom
i
have
already
mentioned
it
is
strange
how
often
my
duty
did
lead
me
in
her
way
she
is
a
demure
little
creature
with
wits
as
bright
as
her
eyes
which
is
saying
a
great
deal
and
while
in
the
course
of
our
long
friendship
i
had
admired
without
making
use
of
the
special
abilities
i
saw
in
her
i
felt
that
the
time
had
now
come
when
they
might
prove
of
inestimable
value
to
me
greeting
her
with
pardonable
abruptness
i
expressed
my
wishes
in
these
possibly
alarming
words
jinny
you
can
do
something
for
me
find
out
i
know
you
can
and
that
too
without
arousing
suspicion
or
compromising
either
of
us
where
moore
of
waverley
avenue
buys
his
groceries
and
when
you
have
done
that
whether
or
not
he
has
lately
resupplied
himself
with
candles
the
surprise
which
she
showed
had
a
touch
of
naivete
in
it
which
was
very
encouraging
mr
moore
she
cried
the
uncle
of
her
who
who
the
very
same
i
responded
and
waited
for
her
questions
without
adding
a
single
word
in
way
of
explanation
she
gave
me
a
look
oh
what
a
look
it
was
as
encouraging
to
the
detective
as
it
was
welcome
to
the
lover
after
which
she
nodded
once
in
doubt
once
in
question
and
once
in
frank
and
laughing
consent
and
darted
off
i
thanked
providence
for
such
a
little
and
proceeded
on
my
way
in
a
state
of
great
an
hour
later
i
came
upon
her
again
it
is
really
extraordinary
how
frequently
the
paths
of
some
people
cross
well
i
asked
moore
deals
with
simpkins
just
two
blocks
away
from
his
house
and
only
a
week
ago
he
bought
some
candles
there
i
rewarded
her
with
a
smile
which
summoned
into
view
the
most
exasperating
of
dimples
you
had
better
patronize
simpkins
yourself
for
a
little
while
i
suggested
and
by
the
arch
glance
with
which
my
words
were
received
i
perceived
that
my
meaning
was
fully
understood
experiencing
from
this
moment
an
increased
confidence
not
only
in
the
powers
of
my
little
friend
but
in
the
line
of
investigation
thus
happily
established
i
cast
about
for
means
of
settling
the
one
great
question
which
was
a
necessary
preliminary
to
all
future
action
whether
the
marks
detected
by
me
in
the
dust
of
the
mantel
in
the
southwest
chamber
had
been
made
by
the
hand
of
him
who
had
lately
felt
the
need
of
candles
albeit
his
house
appeared
to
be
fully
lighted
by
gas
the
subterfuge
by
which
notwithstanding
my
many
disadvantages
i
was
finally
enabled
to
obtain
unmistakable
answer
to
this
query
was
the
fruit
of
much
hard
thought
perhaps
i
was
too
proud
of
it
perhaps
i
should
have
mistrusted
myself
more
from
the
start
but
i
was
a
great
egotist
in
those
days
and
reckoned
quite
above
their
inherent
worth
any
bright
ideas
which
i
could
safely
call
my
own
the
point
aimed
at
was
this
to
obtain
without
moore
knowledge
an
accurate
impression
of
his
the
task
presented
difficulties
but
these
served
duly
to
increase
my
ardor
confiding
to
the
lieutenant
of
the
precinct
my
great
interest
in
the
mysterious
house
with
whose
suggestive
interior
i
had
made
myself
acquainted
under
such
tragic
circumstances
i
asked
him
as
a
personal
favor
to
obtain
for
me
an
opportunity
of
spending
another
night
there
he
was
evidently
surprised
by
the
request
not
cherishing
as
i
suppose
any
great
longings
himself
in
this
direction
but
recognizing
that
for
some
reason
i
set
great
store
on
this
questionable
privilege
i
do
not
think
that
he
suspected
in
the
least
what
that
reason
was
and
being
as
i
have
intimated
favorably
disposed
to
me
he
exerted
himself
to
such
good
effect
that
i
was
formally
detailed
to
assist
in
keeping
watch
over
the
premises
that
very
night
i
think
that
it
was
at
this
point
i
began
to
reckon
on
the
success
which
after
many
failures
and
some
mischances
was
yet
to
reward
my
efforts
as
i
prepared
to
enter
the
old
house
at
nightfall
i
allowed
myself
one
short
glance
across
the
way
to
see
if
my
approach
had
been
observed
by
the
man
whose
secret
if
secret
he
had
i
was
laying
plans
to
surprise
i
was
met
by
a
sight
i
had
not
expected
pausing
on
the
pavement
in
front
of
me
stood
a
handsome
elderly
gentleman
whose
appearance
was
so
fashionable
and
thoroughly
up
to
date
that
i
should
have
failed
to
recognize
him
if
my
glance
had
not
taken
in
at
the
same
instant
the
figure
of
rudge
crouching
obstinately
on
the
edge
of
the
curb
where
he
had
evidently
posted
himself
in
distinct
refusal
to
come
any
farther
in
vain
his
master
for
the
man
before
me
was
no
less
a
personage
than
the
whilom
butt
of
all
the
boys
between
the
capitol
and
the
treasury
building
signaled
and
commanded
him
to
cross
to
his
side
nothing
could
induce
the
mastiff
to
budge
from
that
quarter
of
the
street
where
he
felt
himself
safe
moore
glorying
in
the
prospect
of
unlimited
wealth
presented
a
startling
contrast
in
more
ways
than
one
to
the
old
man
whose
curious
garb
and
lonely
habits
had
made
him
an
object
of
ridicule
to
half
the
town
i
own
that
i
was
half
amused
and
half
awed
by
the
condescending
bow
with
which
he
greeted
my
offhand
nod
and
the
affable
way
in
which
he
remarked
you
are
making
use
of
your
prerogatives
as
a
member
of
the
police
i
see
the
words
came
as
easily
from
his
lips
as
if
his
practice
in
affability
had
been
of
the
very
longest
i
wonder
how
the
old
place
enjoys
its
present
distinction
he
went
on
running
his
eye
over
the
dilapidated
walls
under
which
we
stood
with
very
evident
pride
in
their
vast
proportions
and
the
air
of
gloomy
grandeur
which
signalized
them
if
it
partakes
in
the
slightest
degree
of
the
feelings
of
its
owner
i
can
vouch
for
its
impatience
at
the
free
use
which
is
made
of
its
rooms
and
halls
are
these
intrusions
necessary
now
that
body
has
been
removed
do
you
feel
that
the
scene
of
her
demise
need
hold
the
attention
of
the
police
any
longer
that
is
a
question
to
put
to
the
superintendent
and
not
to
me
was
my
deprecatory
reply
the
major
has
issued
no
orders
for
the
watch
to
be
taken
off
so
we
men
have
no
choice
i
am
sorry
if
it
offends
you
doubtless
a
few
days
will
end
the
matter
and
the
keys
will
be
given
into
your
hand
i
suppose
you
are
anxious
to
move
in
he
cast
a
glance
behind
him
at
his
dog
gave
a
whistle
which
passed
unheeded
and
replied
with
dignity
if
but
little
heart
when
a
man
has
passed
his
seventh
decade
he
is
not
apt
to
be
so
patient
with
delay
as
when
he
has
a
prospect
of
many
years
before
him
i
am
anxious
to
enter
my
own
house
yes
i
have
much
to
do
there
i
came
very
near
asking
him
what
but
feared
to
seem
too
familiar
in
case
he
was
the
cold
but
upright
man
he
would
fain
appear
and
too
interested
and
inquiring
if
he
were
the
whited
sepulcher
i
secretly
considered
him
so
with
a
nod
a
trifle
more
pronounced
than
if
i
had
been
unaffected
by
either
hypothesis
i
remounted
the
steps
carelessly
remarking
i
see
you
again
after
taking
a
turn
through
the
house
if
i
discover
anything
ghost
marks
or
human
marks
which
might
be
of
interest
to
you
i
let
you
know
something
like
a
growl
answered
me
but
whether
it
came
from
master
or
dog
i
did
not
stop
to
inquire
i
had
serious
work
before
me
very
serious
considering
that
it
was
to
be
done
on
my
own
responsibility
and
without
the
knowledge
of
my
superiors
but
i
was
sustained
by
the
thought
that
no
whisper
of
murder
had
as
yet
been
heard
abroad
or
at
headquarters
and
that
consequently
i
was
interfering
in
no
great
case
merely
trying
to
formulate
one
it
was
necessary
for
the
success
of
my
plan
that
some
time
should
elapse
before
i
reapproached
moore
i
therefore
kept
my
word
to
him
and
satisfied
my
own
curiosity
by
taking
a
fresh
tour
through
the
house
naturally
in
doing
this
i
visited
the
library
here
all
was
dark
the
faint
twilight
still
illuminating
the
streets
failed
to
penetrate
here
i
was
obliged
to
light
my
lantern
my
first
glance
was
toward
the
fireplace
venturesome
hands
had
been
there
not
only
had
the
fender
been
drawn
out
and
the
grate
set
aside
but
the
huge
settle
had
been
wrenched
free
from
the
mantel
and
dragged
into
the
center
of
the
room
rather
pleased
at
this
change
for
with
all
my
apparent
bravado
i
did
not
enjoy
too
close
a
proximity
to
the
cruel
hearthstone
i
stopped
to
give
this
settle
a
thorough
investigation
the
result
was
disappointing
to
all
appearance
and
i
did
not
spare
it
the
experiment
of
many
a
thump
and
knock
it
was
a
perfectly
innocuous
piece
of
furniture
clumsy
of
build
but
solid
and
absolutely
devoid
of
anything
that
could
explain
the
tragedies
which
had
occurred
so
near
it
i
even
sat
down
on
its
musty
old
cushion
and
shut
my
eyes
but
was
unrewarded
by
alarming
visions
or
disturbance
of
any
sort
nor
did
the
floor
where
it
had
stood
yield
any
better
results
to
the
inquiring
eye
nothing
was
to
be
seen
there
but
the
marks
left
by
the
removal
of
its
base
from
the
blackened
boards
disgusted
with
myself
if
not
with
this
object
of
my
present
disappointment
i
left
that
portion
of
the
room
in
which
it
stood
and
crossed
to
where
i
had
found
the
little
table
on
the
night
of
jeffrey
death
it
was
no
longer
there
it
had
been
set
back
against
the
wall
where
it
properly
belonged
and
the
candelabrum
removed
nor
was
the
kitchen
chair
any
longer
to
be
seen
near
the
book
shelves
this
fact
small
as
it
was
caused
me
an
instant
of
chagrin
i
had
intended
to
look
again
at
the
book
which
i
had
examined
with
such
unsatisfactory
results
the
time
before
a
glance
showed
me
that
this
book
had
been
pushed
back
level
with
the
others
but
i
remembered
its
title
and
had
the
means
of
reaching
it
been
at
hand
i
should
certainly
have
stolen
another
peep
at
it
upstairs
i
found
the
same
signs
of
police
interference
the
shutter
had
been
fastened
in
the
southwest
room
and
the
bouquet
and
wrap
taken
away
from
the
bed
the
handkerchief
also
was
missing
from
the
mantel
where
i
had
left
it
and
when
i
opened
the
closet
door
it
was
to
find
the
floor
bare
and
the
second
candelabrum
and
candle
removed
all
gone
thought
i
each
and
every
clue
but
i
was
mistaken
in
another
moment
i
came
upon
the
minute
filings
i
had
before
observed
scattered
over
a
small
stand
concluding
from
this
that
they
had
been
passed
over
by
durbin
and
his
associates
as
valueless
i
swept
them
together
with
the
dust
in
which
they
lay
into
an
old
envelope
i
happily
found
in
my
pocket
then
i
crossed
to
the
mantel
and
made
a
close
inspection
of
its
now
empty
shelf
the
scratches
which
i
had
made
there
were
visible
enough
but
the
impressions
for
which
they
stood
had
vanished
in
the
handling
which
everything
in
the
house
had
undergone
regarding
with
great
thankfulness
the
result
of
my
own
foresight
i
made
haste
to
leave
the
room
i
then
proceeded
to
take
my
first
steps
in
the
ticklish
experiment
by
which
i
hoped
to
determine
whether
uncle
david
had
had
any
share
in
the
fatal
business
which
had
rendered
the
two
rooms
i
had
just
visited
so
memorable
first
satisfying
myself
by
a
peep
through
the
front
window
that
he
was
positively
at
watch
behind
the
vines
i
went
directly
to
the
kitchen
procured
a
chair
and
carried
it
into
the
library
where
i
put
it
to
a
use
that
to
an
onlooker
eye
would
have
appeared
very
peculiar
planting
it
squarely
on
the
hearthstone
not
without
some
secret
perturbation
as
to
what
the
results
might
be
to
myself
i
mounted
it
and
took
down
the
engraving
which
i
have
already
described
as
hanging
over
this
mantelpiece
setting
it
on
end
against
one
of
the
jambs
of
the
fireplace
i
mounted
the
chair
once
more
and
carefully
sifted
over
the
high
shelf
the
contents
of
a
little
package
which
i
had
brought
with
me
for
this
purpose
then
leaving
the
chair
where
it
was
i
betook
myself
out
of
the
front
door
ostentatiously
stopping
to
lock
it
and
to
put
the
key
in
my
pocket
crossing
immediately
to
moore
side
of
the
street
i
encountered
him
as
i
had
expected
to
do
at
his
own
gateway
well
what
now
he
inquired
with
the
same
exaggerated
courtesy
i
had
noticed
in
him
on
a
previous
occasion
you
have
the
air
of
a
man
bringing
news
has
anything
fresh
happened
in
the
old
house
i
assumed
a
frankness
which
seemed
to
impose
on
him
do
you
know
i
sententiously
informed
him
i
have
a
wonderful
interest
in
that
old
hearthstone
or
rather
in
the
seemingly
innocent
engraving
hanging
over
it
of
benjamin
franklin
at
the
court
of
france
i
tell
you
frankly
that
i
had
no
idea
of
what
would
be
found
behind
the
picture
i
saw
by
his
quick
look
that
i
had
stirred
up
a
hornets
nest
this
was
just
what
i
had
calculated
to
do
behind
it
he
repeated
there
is
nothing
behind
it
i
laughed
shrugged
my
shoulders
and
backed
slowly
toward
the
door
of
course
you
should
know
i
retorted
with
some
condescension
then
as
if
struck
by
a
sudden
remembrance
oh
by
the
way
have
you
been
told
that
there
is
a
window
on
that
lower
floor
which
does
not
stay
fastened
i
speak
of
it
that
you
may
have
it
repaired
as
soon
as
the
police
vacate
it
the
last
one
in
the
hall
leading
to
the
negro
quarters
if
you
shake
it
hard
enough
the
catch
falls
back
and
any
one
can
raise
it
even
from
the
outside
i
will
see
to
it
he
replied
dropping
his
eyes
possibly
to
hide
their
curious
twinkle
but
what
do
you
mean
about
finding
something
in
the
wall
behind
that
old
picture
i
never
heard
but
though
he
spoke
quickly
and
shouted
the
last
words
after
me
at
the
top
of
his
voice
i
was
by
this
time
too
far
away
to
respond
save
by
a
dubious
smile
and
a
wave
of
the
hand
not
until
i
was
nearly
out
of
earshot
did
i
venture
to
shout
back
the
following
words
i
be
back
in
an
hour
if
anything
happens
if
the
boys
annoy
you
or
any
one
attempts
to
enter
the
old
house
telephone
to
the
station
or
summon
the
officer
at
the
corner
i
do
believe
any
harm
will
come
from
leaving
the
place
to
itself
for
a
while
then
i
walked
around
the
block
when
i
arrived
in
front
again
it
was
quite
dark
so
was
the
house
but
there
was
light
in
the
library
i
felt
assured
that
i
should
find
uncle
david
there
and
i
did
when
after
a
noiseless
entrance
and
a
careful
advance
through
the
hall
i
threw
open
the
door
beyond
the
gilded
pillars
it
was
to
see
the
tall
figure
of
this
old
man
mounted
upon
the
chair
i
had
left
there
peering
up
at
the
nail
from
which
i
had
so
lately
lifted
the
picture
he
started
as
i
presented
myself
and
almost
fell
from
the
chair
but
the
careless
laugh
i
uttered
assured
him
of
the
little
importance
i
placed
upon
this
evidence
of
his
daring
and
unappeasable
curiosity
and
he
confronted
me
with
an
enviable
air
of
dignity
whereupon
i
managed
to
say
really
moore
i
glad
to
see
you
here
it
is
quite
natural
for
you
to
wish
to
learn
by
any
means
in
your
power
what
that
picture
concealed
i
came
back
because
i
suddenly
remembered
that
i
had
forgotten
to
rehang
it
involuntarily
he
glanced
again
at
the
wall
overhead
which
was
as
bare
as
his
hand
save
for
the
nail
he
had
already
examined
it
has
concealed
nothing
he
retorted
you
can
see
yourself
that
the
wall
is
bare
and
that
it
rings
as
sound
as
any
chimneypiece
ever
made
here
he
struck
it
heavily
with
his
fist
what
did
you
imagine
that
you
had
found
i
smiled
shrugged
my
shoulders
in
tantalizing
repetition
of
my
former
action
upon
a
like
occasion
and
then
answered
brusquely
i
did
not
come
back
to
betray
police
secrets
but
to
restore
this
picture
to
its
place
or
perhaps
you
prefer
to
have
it
down
rather
than
up
it
is
much
of
an
ornament
he
scrutinized
me
darkly
from
over
his
shoulder
a
wary
gleam
showing
itself
in
his
shrewd
old
eyes
and
the
idea
crossed
me
that
the
moment
might
possess
more
significance
than
appeared
but
i
did
not
step
backward
nor
give
evidence
in
any
way
that
i
had
even
thought
of
danger
i
simply
laid
my
hand
on
the
picture
and
looked
up
at
him
for
orders
he
promptly
signified
that
he
wished
it
hung
adding
as
i
hesitated
these
words
the
pictures
in
this
house
are
supposed
to
stay
on
the
walls
where
they
belong
there
is
a
traditional
superstition
against
removing
them
i
immediately
lifted
the
print
from
the
floor
no
doubt
he
had
me
at
a
disadvantage
if
evil
was
in
his
heart
and
my
position
on
the
hearth
was
as
dangerous
as
previous
events
had
proved
it
to
be
but
it
would
not
do
to
show
the
white
feather
at
a
moment
when
his
fate
if
not
my
own
hung
in
the
balance
so
motioning
him
to
step
down
i
put
foot
on
the
chair
and
raised
the
picture
aloft
to
hang
it
as
i
did
so
he
moved
over
to
the
huge
settle
of
his
ancestors
and
crossing
his
arms
over
its
back
surveyed
me
with
a
smile
i
rather
imagined
than
saw
suddenly
as
i
strained
to
put
the
cord
over
the
nail
he
called
out
look
out
you
fall
if
he
had
intended
to
give
me
a
start
in
payment
for
my
previous
rebuff
he
did
not
succeed
for
my
nerves
had
grown
steady
and
my
arm
firm
at
the
glimpse
i
had
caught
of
the
shelf
below
me
the
fine
brown
powder
i
had
scattered
there
had
been
displaced
in
five
distinct
spots
and
not
by
my
fingers
i
had
preferred
to
risk
the
loss
of
my
balance
rather
than
rest
my
hand
on
the
shelf
but
he
had
taken
no
such
precaution
the
clue
i
so
anxiously
desired
and
for
which
i
had
so
recklessly
worked
was
obtained
but
when
half
an
hour
later
i
found
an
opportunity
of
measuring
these
marks
and
comparing
them
with
those
upstairs
i
did
not
enjoy
the
full
triumph
i
had
promised
myself
for
the
two
impressions
utterly
failed
to
coincide
thus
proving
that
whoever
the
person
was
who
had
been
in
this
house
with
jeffrey
on
the
evening
she
died
it
was
not
her
uncle
david
viii
slyer
woes
let
me
repeat
the
person
who
had
left
the
marks
of
his
presence
in
the
upper
chamber
of
the
moore
house
was
not
the
man
popularly
known
as
uncle
david
who
then
had
it
been
but
one
name
suggested
itself
to
me
jeffrey
it
was
not
so
easy
for
me
to
reach
this
man
as
it
had
been
for
me
to
reach
his
singular
and
unimaginative
uncle
in
the
first
place
his
door
had
been
closed
to
every
one
since
his
wife
death
neither
friends
nor
strangers
could
gain
admittance
there
unless
they
came
vested
with
authority
from
the
coroner
and
this
even
if
i
could
manage
to
obtain
it
would
not
answer
in
my
case
what
i
had
to
say
and
do
would
better
follow
a
chance
encounter
but
no
chance
encounter
with
this
gentleman
seemed
likely
to
fall
to
my
lot
and
finally
i
swallowed
my
pride
and
asked
another
favor
of
the
lieutenant
would
he
see
that
i
was
given
an
opportunity
for
carrying
some
message
or
of
doing
some
errand
which
would
lead
to
my
having
an
interview
with
jeffrey
if
he
would
i
stood
ready
to
promise
that
my
curiosity
should
stop
at
this
point
and
that
i
would
cease
to
make
a
nuisance
of
myself
i
think
he
suspected
me
by
this
time
but
he
made
no
remark
and
in
a
day
or
so
i
was
summoned
to
carry
a
note
to
the
house
in
k
street
jeffrey
funeral
had
taken
place
the
day
before
and
the
house
looked
deserted
but
my
summons
speedily
brought
a
but
very
nervous
maid
to
the
door
whose
eyes
took
on
an
unmistakable
expression
of
resistance
when
i
announced
my
errand
and
asked
to
see
jeffrey
the
expression
would
not
have
struck
me
as
peculiar
if
she
had
raised
any
objection
to
the
interview
i
had
solicited
but
she
did
not
her
fear
and
antipathy
consequently
sprang
from
some
other
source
than
her
interest
in
the
man
most
threatened
by
my
visit
was
it
be
on
her
own
account
recalling
what
i
had
heard
whispered
about
the
station
concerning
a
maid
of
the
jeffreys
who
always
seemed
on
the
point
of
saying
something
which
never
really
left
her
lips
i
stopped
her
as
she
was
about
to
slip
upstairs
and
quietly
asked
are
you
loretta
the
way
she
turned
the
way
she
looked
at
me
as
she
gave
me
a
short
affirmative
and
then
quickly
proceeded
on
her
way
convinced
me
that
my
colleagues
were
right
as
to
her
being
a
woman
who
had
some
cause
for
dreading
police
interference
i
instantly
made
up
my
mind
that
here
was
a
mine
to
be
worked
and
that
i
knew
just
the
demure
little
soul
best
equipped
to
act
the
part
of
miner
in
a
moment
she
came
back
and
i
had
a
chance
to
note
again
her
pretty
but
expressionless
features
among
which
the
restless
eyes
alone
bespoke
character
or
decision
jeffrey
is
in
the
back
room
upstairs
she
announced
he
says
for
you
to
come
up
is
it
the
room
jeffrey
used
to
occupy
i
asked
with
open
curiosity
as
i
passed
her
an
involuntary
shudder
proved
that
she
was
not
without
feeling
so
did
the
quick
disclaimer
no
no
those
rooms
are
closed
he
occupies
the
one
miss
tuttle
had
before
she
went
away
oh
then
miss
tuttle
is
gone
loretta
disdained
to
answer
she
had
already
said
enough
to
cause
her
to
bite
her
lip
as
she
disappeared
down
the
basement
stair
decidedly
the
boys
were
right
an
uneasy
feeling
followed
any
conversation
with
this
girl
yet
while
there
was
slyness
in
her
manner
there
was
a
certain
frank
honesty
visible
in
it
too
which
caused
me
to
think
that
if
she
could
ever
be
made
to
speak
her
evidence
could
be
relied
on
jeffrey
was
sitting
with
his
back
to
the
door
when
i
entered
but
turned
as
i
spoke
his
name
and
held
out
his
hand
for
the
note
i
carried
i
had
no
expectation
of
his
remembering
me
as
one
of
the
men
who
had
stood
about
that
night
in
the
moore
house
and
i
was
not
disappointed
to
him
i
was
merely
a
messenger
or
common
policeman
and
he
consequently
paid
me
no
attention
while
i
bestowed
upon
him
the
most
concentrated
scrutiny
of
my
whole
life
till
now
i
had
seen
him
only
in
half
lights
or
under
circumstances
precluding
my
getting
a
very
accurate
idea
of
him
as
a
man
and
a
gentleman
now
he
sat
with
the
broad
daylight
on
his
face
and
i
had
every
opportunity
for
noting
both
his
features
and
expression
he
was
of
a
distinguished
type
but
the
cloud
enshrouding
him
was
as
heavy
as
any
i
had
ever
seen
darkening
about
a
man
of
his
position
and
character
his
manner
fettered
though
it
was
by
gloomy
thoughts
was
not
just
the
manner
i
had
expected
to
encounter
he
had
a
large
clear
eye
but
the
veil
which
hid
the
brightness
of
his
regard
was
misty
with
suspicion
not
with
tears
he
appeared
to
shrink
from
observation
and
shifted
uneasily
as
long
as
i
stood
in
front
of
him
though
he
said
nothing
and
did
not
lift
his
eyes
from
the
letter
he
was
perusing
till
he
heard
me
step
back
to
the
door
i
had
purposely
left
open
and
softly
close
it
then
he
glanced
up
with
a
keen
if
not
an
alarmed
look
which
seemed
an
exaggerated
one
for
the
occasion
that
is
if
he
had
no
secret
to
keep
do
you
suffer
so
from
drafts
he
asked
rising
in
a
way
which
in
itself
was
a
dismissal
i
smiled
an
amused
denial
then
with
the
simple
directness
i
thought
most
likely
to
win
me
his
confidence
entered
straight
upon
my
business
in
these
plain
words
pardon
me
jeffrey
i
have
something
to
say
which
is
not
exactly
fitted
for
the
ears
of
servants
then
as
he
pushed
his
chair
suddenly
back
i
added
reassuringly
it
is
not
a
police
matter
sir
but
an
entirely
personal
one
it
may
strike
you
as
important
and
it
may
not
jeffrey
i
was
the
man
who
made
the
unhappy
discovery
in
the
moore
mansion
which
has
plunged
this
house
into
mourning
this
announcement
startled
him
and
produced
a
visible
change
in
his
manner
his
eyes
flew
first
to
one
door
and
then
to
another
as
if
it
were
he
who
feared
intrusion
now
i
beg
your
pardon
for
speaking
on
so
painful
a
topic
i
went
on
as
soon
as
i
saw
he
was
ready
to
listen
to
me
my
excuse
is
that
i
came
upon
a
little
thing
that
same
night
which
i
have
not
thought
of
sufficient
importance
to
mention
to
any
one
else
but
which
it
may
interest
you
to
hear
about
here
i
took
from
a
book
i
held
a
piece
of
it
was
white
on
one
side
and
blue
on
the
other
the
white
side
i
had
thickly
chalked
though
this
was
not
apparent
laying
down
this
piece
of
chalked
side
up
on
the
end
of
a
large
table
near
which
we
were
standing
i
took
out
an
envelope
from
my
pocket
and
shaking
it
gently
to
and
fro
remarked
in
an
upper
room
of
the
moore
house
you
remember
the
southwest
chamber
sir
ali
did
he
there
was
no
misdoubting
the
quick
emotion
the
shrinking
and
the
alarm
with
which
he
heard
this
room
mentioned
it
was
in
that
room
that
i
found
these
tipping
up
the
envelope
i
scattered
over
the
face
of
the
blotter
a
few
of
the
glistening
particles
i
had
collected
from
the
place
mentioned
he
bent
over
them
astonished
then
as
was
natural
brushed
them
together
in
a
heap
with
the
tips
of
his
fingers
and
leaned
to
look
again
just
as
i
breathed
a
heavy
sigh
which
scattered
them
far
and
wide
instinctively
he
withdrew
his
hand
whereupon
i
embraced
the
opportunity
of
turning
the
blotter
over
uttering
meanwhile
the
most
profuse
apologies
then
as
if
anxious
not
to
repeat
my
misadventure
i
let
the
blotter
lie
where
it
was
and
pouring
out
the
few
remaining
particles
into
my
palm
i
held
them
toward
the
light
in
such
a
way
that
he
was
compelled
to
lean
across
the
table
in
order
to
see
them
naturally
for
i
had
planned
the
distance
well
his
white
with
the
chalk
he
had
unconsciously
handled
touched
the
blue
surface
of
the
blotter
now
lying
uppermost
and
left
their
marks
there
i
could
have
shouted
in
my
elation
at
the
success
of
this
risky
maneuver
but
managed
to
suppress
my
emotion
and
to
stand
quite
still
while
he
took
a
good
look
at
the
filings
they
seemed
to
have
great
and
unusual
interest
for
him
and
it
was
with
no
ordinary
emotion
that
he
finally
asked
what
do
you
make
out
of
these
and
why
do
you
bring
them
here
my
answer
was
written
under
his
hand
but
this
it
was
far
from
my
policy
to
impart
so
putting
on
my
friendliest
air
i
returned
with
suitable
respect
i
do
know
what
to
make
of
them
they
look
like
gold
but
that
is
for
you
to
decide
do
you
want
them
sir
no
he
replied
starting
erect
and
withdrawing
his
hand
from
the
blotter
it
but
a
trifle
not
worth
our
attention
but
i
thank
you
just
the
same
for
bringing
it
to
my
notice
and
again
his
manner
became
a
plain
dismissal
this
time
i
accepted
it
as
such
without
question
carelessly
restoring
the
piece
of
to
the
book
from
which
i
had
taken
it
i
made
a
bow
and
withdrew
toward
the
door
he
seemed
to
be
thinking
and
the
deep
furrows
which
i
am
sure
had
been
lacking
from
his
brow
a
week
previous
became
startlingly
visible
finally
he
observed
jeffrey
was
not
in
her
right
mind
when
she
so
unhappily
took
her
life
i
see
now
that
the
change
in
her
dates
back
to
her
wedding
day
consequently
any
little
peculiarity
she
may
have
shown
at
that
time
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
certainly
not
i
boldly
ventured
if
such
peculiarities
were
shown
after
the
fright
given
her
by
the
catastrophe
which
took
place
in
the
library
his
eyes
which
were
fixed
on
mine
flashed
and
his
hands
closed
convulsively
we
will
not
consider
the
subject
he
muttered
reseating
himself
in
the
chair
from
which
he
had
risen
i
bowed
again
and
went
out
i
did
not
dwell
on
the
interview
in
my
own
mind
nor
did
i
allow
myself
to
draw
any
conclusions
from
it
till
i
had
carried
the
blotter
into
the
southwest
chamber
of
the
moore
house
and
carefully
compared
the
impressions
made
on
it
with
the
marks
i
had
scratched
on
the
surface
of
the
this
i
did
by
laying
the
one
over
the
other
after
having
made
holes
where
his
had
touched
the
blotter
the
holes
in
the
blotter
and
the
marks
outlined
upon
the
shelf
coincided
exactly
ix
jinny
i
have
already
mentioned
the
man
whom
i
secretly
looked
upon
as
standing
between
me
and
all
preferment
he
was
a
fellow
but
he
wore
a
natural
sneer
which
for
some
reason
i
felt
to
be
always
directed
toward
myself
this
sneer
grew
pronounced
about
this
time
and
that
was
the
reason
no
doubt
why
i
continued
to
work
as
long
as
i
did
in
secret
i
dreaded
the
open
laugh
of
this
man
a
laugh
which
always
seemed
hovering
on
his
lips
and
which
was
only
held
in
restraint
by
the
awe
we
all
felt
of
the
major
notwithstanding
i
made
one
slight
move
encountering
the
i
ventured
to
ask
if
he
was
quite
satisfied
with
the
evidence
collected
in
the
jeffrey
case
his
surprise
did
not
prevent
him
from
asking
my
reasons
for
this
question
i
replied
to
this
effect
because
i
have
a
little
friend
winsome
enough
and
subtle
enough
to
worm
the
truth
out
of
the
devil
i
hear
that
the
girl
loretta
is
suspected
of
knowing
more
about
this
unfortunate
tragedy
than
she
is
willing
to
impart
if
you
wish
this
little
friend
of
mine
to
talk
to
her
i
will
see
that
she
does
so
and
does
so
with
effect
the
looked
interested
whom
do
you
mean
by
friend
and
what
is
her
name
i
will
send
her
to
you
and
i
did
the
next
day
i
was
standing
on
the
corner
of
vermont
avenue
when
i
saw
jinny
advancing
from
the
house
in
k
street
she
was
chipper
and
she
was
smiling
in
a
way
which
made
me
say
to
myself
it
is
fortunate
that
durbin
is
not
here
for
jinny
one
weakness
is
her
lack
of
power
to
hide
the
satisfaction
she
takes
in
any
detective
work
that
comes
her
way
i
had
told
her
of
this
and
had
more
than
once
tried
to
impress
upon
her
that
her
smile
was
a
complete
but
i
noticed
that
if
she
kept
it
from
her
lips
it
forced
its
way
out
of
her
eyes
and
if
she
kept
it
out
of
her
eyes
it
beamed
like
an
inner
radiance
from
her
whole
face
so
i
gave
up
the
task
of
making
her
perfect
and
let
her
go
on
smiling
glad
that
she
had
such
frequent
cause
for
it
this
morning
her
smile
had
a
touch
of
pride
in
it
as
well
as
of
delight
and
noting
this
i
remarked
you
have
made
loretta
talk
her
head
went
up
and
a
demure
dimple
appeared
in
her
cheek
what
did
she
say
i
urged
what
has
she
been
keeping
back
you
will
have
to
ask
the
coroner
my
orders
were
strict
to
bring
the
results
of
my
interview
immediately
to
him
does
that
include
durbin
does
it
include
you
i
am
afraid
not
you
are
right
but
why
should
it
include
you
what
do
you
mean
jinny
why
do
you
keep
your
own
counsel
so
long
you
have
ideas
about
this
crime
i
know
why
not
mention
them
jinny
a
word
to
the
wise
is
sufficient
she
laughed
and
turned
her
pretty
face
toward
the
coroner
once
but
she
was
a
woman
and
could
not
help
glancing
back
and
meeting
my
dubious
look
she
broke
into
an
arch
smile
and
naively
added
this
remark
loretta
is
a
busybody
ashamed
of
her
own
curiosity
so
much
there
can
be
no
harm
in
telling
you
when
one
knowledge
has
been
gained
by
lingering
behind
doors
and
peeping
through
cracks
one
is
not
so
ready
to
say
what
one
has
seen
and
heard
loretta
is
in
that
box
and
being
more
than
a
little
scared
of
the
police
was
glad
to
let
her
anxiety
and
her
fears
overflow
into
a
sympathizing
ear
she
be
surprised
when
she
is
called
up
some
fine
day
by
the
coroner
i
wonder
if
she
will
blame
me
for
it
she
will
never
think
of
doing
so
i
basely
assured
my
little
friend
with
an
appreciative
glance
at
her
sparkling
eye
and
dimpled
cheek
the
arch
little
creature
started
to
move
off
again
as
she
did
so
she
cried
be
good
and
do
let
durbin
cut
in
on
you
but
stopped
for
the
second
time
when
half
across
the
street
and
when
obedient
to
her
look
i
hastily
rejoined
her
she
whispered
demurely
oh
i
forgot
to
tell
you
something
that
i
heard
this
morning
and
which
nobody
but
yourself
has
any
right
to
know
i
was
following
your
commands
and
buying
groceries
at
simpkins
when
just
as
i
was
coming
out
with
my
arms
full
i
heard
old
simpkins
mention
name
and
with
such
interest
that
i
naturally
wanted
to
hear
what
he
had
to
say
having
no
real
excuse
for
staying
i
poked
my
finger
into
a
bag
of
sugar
i
was
carrying
till
the
sugar
ran
out
and
i
had
to
wait
till
it
was
put
up
again
this
did
not
take
long
but
it
took
long
enough
for
me
to
hear
the
old
grocer
say
that
he
knew
jeffrey
and
that
that
gentleman
had
come
into
his
shop
only
a
day
or
two
before
his
wife
death
to
buy
candles
the
archness
with
which
this
was
said
together
with
the
fact
itself
made
me
her
slave
forever
as
her
small
figure
faded
from
sight
down
the
avenue
i
decided
to
take
her
advice
and
follow
up
whatever
communication
she
had
to
make
to
the
coroner
by
a
confession
of
my
own
suspicions
and
what
they
had
led
me
into
if
he
laughed
well
i
could
stand
it
it
was
not
the
coroner
laugh
nor
even
the
major
that
i
feared
it
was
durbin
x
francis
jeffrey
jinny
had
not
been
gone
an
hour
from
the
coroner
office
when
an
opportunity
was
afforded
for
me
to
approach
that
gentleman
myself
with
few
apologies
and
no
preamble
i
immediately
entered
upon
my
story
which
i
made
as
concise
and
as
much
to
the
point
as
possible
i
did
not
expect
praise
from
him
but
i
did
look
for
some
slight
show
of
astonishment
at
the
nature
of
my
news
i
was
therefore
greatly
disappointed
when
after
a
moment
quiet
consideration
he
carelessly
remarked
very
good
very
good
the
one
point
you
make
is
excellent
and
may
prove
of
use
to
us
we
had
reached
the
same
conclusion
but
by
another
road
you
ask
blew
out
the
candle
we
tied
the
pistol
to
jeffrey
arm
it
could
not
have
been
tied
by
herself
who
was
her
accessory
then
ah
you
did
think
of
that
i
flushed
as
if
a
pail
of
hot
water
had
been
dashed
suddenly
over
me
he
was
right
the
conclusion
he
spoke
of
had
failed
to
strike
me
why
it
was
a
perfectly
obvious
one
as
obvious
as
that
the
candle
had
been
blown
out
by
another
breath
than
hers
yet
absorbed
in
my
own
train
of
thought
i
had
completely
overlooked
it
the
coroner
observing
my
embarrassment
smiled
and
my
humiliation
was
complete
or
would
have
been
had
durbin
been
there
but
fortunately
he
was
not
i
am
a
fool
i
cried
i
thought
i
had
discovered
something
i
might
have
known
that
there
were
keener
minds
than
mine
in
this
office
easy
easy
was
the
interruption
you
have
done
well
if
i
did
not
think
so
i
would
not
keep
you
here
a
minute
as
it
is
i
am
disposed
to
let
you
see
that
in
a
case
like
this
one
man
must
not
expect
to
monopolize
all
the
honors
this
matter
of
the
bow
of
ribbon
would
strike
any
old
and
experienced
official
i
only
wonder
that
we
have
not
seen
it
openly
discussed
in
the
papers
taking
a
box
from
his
desk
he
opened
it
and
held
it
out
toward
me
a
coil
of
white
ribbon
surmounted
by
a
crisp
and
dainty
bow
met
my
eyes
you
recognize
it
he
asked
indeed
i
did
it
was
cut
from
her
wrist
by
my
deputy
miss
tuttle
wished
him
to
untie
it
but
he
preferred
to
leave
the
bow
intact
now
lift
it
out
careful
man
do
soil
it
you
will
see
why
in
a
minute
as
i
held
the
ribbon
up
he
pointed
to
some
spots
on
its
fresh
white
surface
do
you
see
those
he
asked
those
are
and
they
were
made
as
truly
by
some
one
fingers
as
the
impressions
you
noted
on
the
in
the
upper
chamber
this
pistol
was
tied
to
her
wrist
after
the
deed
possibly
by
that
same
hand
it
was
my
own
conclusion
but
it
did
not
sound
as
welcome
to
me
from
his
lips
as
i
had
expected
either
my
nature
is
narrow
or
my
inordinate
jealousy
lays
me
open
to
the
most
astonishing
inconsistencies
for
no
sooner
had
he
spoken
these
words
than
i
experienced
a
sudden
revulsion
against
my
own
theory
and
the
suspicions
which
it
threw
upon
the
man
whom
an
hour
before
i
was
eager
to
proclaim
a
criminal
but
coroner
gave
me
no
chance
for
making
such
a
fool
of
myself
rescuing
the
ribbon
from
my
hands
which
no
doubt
were
running
a
little
too
freely
over
its
snowy
surface
he
smiled
with
the
indulgence
proper
from
such
a
man
to
a
novice
like
myself
and
observed
quite
frankly
you
will
consider
these
observations
as
confidential
you
know
how
to
hold
your
tongue
that
you
have
proved
hold
it
then
a
little
longer
the
case
is
not
yet
ripe
jeffrey
is
a
man
of
high
standing
with
a
hitherto
unblemished
reputation
it
do
my
boy
to
throw
the
doubt
of
so
hideous
a
crime
upon
so
fine
a
gentleman
without
ample
reason
that
no
such
mistake
may
be
made
and
that
he
may
have
every
opportunity
for
clearing
himself
i
am
going
to
have
a
confidential
talk
with
him
do
you
want
to
be
present
i
flushed
again
but
this
time
from
extreme
satisfaction
i
am
obliged
for
your
confidence
said
i
then
with
a
burst
of
courage
born
of
his
good
nature
i
inquired
with
due
respect
if
my
little
friend
had
answered
his
expectations
was
she
as
clever
as
i
said
i
asked
your
little
friend
is
a
trump
was
his
blunt
reply
with
what
we
have
learned
through
her
and
now
through
you
we
can
approach
jeffrey
to
some
purpose
it
appears
that
before
leaving
the
house
on
that
tuesday
morning
he
had
an
interview
with
his
wife
which
ought
in
some
way
to
account
for
this
tragedy
perhaps
he
will
tell
us
about
it
and
perhaps
he
will
explain
how
he
came
to
wander
through
the
moore
house
while
his
wife
lay
dying
below
at
all
events
we
will
give
him
the
opportunity
to
do
so
and
if
possible
to
clear
up
mysteries
which
provoke
the
worst
kind
of
conjecture
it
is
time
the
ideas
advanced
by
the
papers
foster
superstition
and
superstition
is
the
devil
go
and
tell
my
man
out
there
that
i
am
going
to
k
street
you
may
say
if
you
like
he
added
with
a
humor
more
welcome
to
me
than
any
serious
concession
did
i
feel
set
up
by
this
rather
jeffrey
was
expecting
us
this
was
evident
from
his
first
look
though
the
attempt
he
made
at
surprise
was
instantaneous
and
very
well
feigned
indeed
i
think
he
was
in
a
constant
state
of
apprehension
during
these
days
and
that
no
inroad
of
the
police
would
have
astonished
him
but
expectation
does
not
preclude
dread
indeed
it
tends
to
foster
it
and
dread
was
in
his
heart
this
he
had
no
power
to
conceal
to
what
am
i
indebted
for
this
second
visit
from
you
he
asked
of
coroner
with
an
admirable
presence
of
mind
are
you
not
yet
satisfied
with
what
we
have
been
able
to
tell
you
of
my
poor
unhappy
end
we
are
not
was
the
plain
response
there
are
some
things
you
have
not
attempted
to
explain
jeffrey
for
instance
why
you
went
to
the
moore
house
previous
to
your
being
called
there
by
the
death
of
your
wife
it
was
a
shot
that
told
an
arrow
which
found
its
mark
jeffrey
flushed
then
turned
pale
rallied
and
again
lost
himself
in
a
maze
of
conflicting
emotions
from
which
he
only
emerged
to
say
how
do
you
know
that
i
was
there
have
i
said
so
or
do
those
old
walls
babble
in
their
sleep
old
walls
have
been
known
to
do
this
was
the
grave
reply
whether
they
had
anything
to
say
in
this
case
is
at
present
quite
immaterial
that
you
were
where
i
charge
you
with
being
is
evident
from
your
own
manner
may
i
then
ask
if
you
have
anything
to
say
about
this
visit
when
a
person
has
died
under
such
peculiar
circumstances
as
jeffrey
everything
bearing
upon
the
case
is
of
interest
to
the
coroner
i
was
sorry
he
added
that
last
sentence
sorry
that
he
felt
obliged
to
qualify
his
action
by
anything
savoring
of
apology
for
the
time
spent
in
its
utterance
afforded
his
agitated
hearer
an
opportunity
not
only
of
collecting
himself
but
of
preparing
an
answer
for
which
he
would
not
have
been
ready
an
instant
before
jeffrey
death
was
a
strange
one
her
husband
admitted
with
tardy
i
find
myself
as
much
at
a
loss
to
understand
it
as
you
do
and
am
therefore
quite
ready
to
answer
the
question
you
have
so
openly
broached
not
that
my
answer
has
any
bearing
upon
the
point
you
wish
to
make
but
because
it
is
your
due
and
my
pleasure
i
did
visit
the
moore
house
as
i
certainly
had
every
right
to
do
the
property
was
my
wife
and
it
was
for
my
interest
to
learn
if
i
could
the
secret
of
its
many
crimes
ah
jeffrey
looked
quickly
up
you
think
that
an
odd
thing
for
me
to
do
at
night
yes
night
is
the
time
for
such
work
i
did
not
care
to
be
seen
pottering
around
there
in
daylight
no
yet
it
would
have
been
so
much
easier
you
would
not
have
had
to
buy
candles
or
carry
a
pistol
or
i
did
not
carry
a
pistol
the
only
pistol
carried
there
was
the
one
with
which
my
demented
wife
chose
to
take
her
life
i
do
not
understand
this
allusion
it
grew
out
of
a
misunderstanding
of
the
situation
jeffrey
excuse
me
if
i
supposed
you
would
be
likely
to
provide
yourself
with
some
means
of
defense
in
venturing
alone
upon
the
scene
of
so
many
mysterious
deaths
i
took
no
precaution
and
needed
none
i
suppose
and
needed
none
when
was
this
visit
paid
jeffrey
before
or
after
your
wife
pulled
the
trigger
which
ended
her
life
you
need
not
hesitate
to
answer
i
do
not
the
elegant
gentleman
before
us
had
acquired
a
certain
fierceness
why
should
i
certainly
you
do
think
that
i
was
there
at
the
same
time
she
was
it
was
not
on
the
same
night
even
so
much
the
walls
should
have
told
you
and
probably
did
or
my
wife
uncle
david
moore
was
he
not
your
informant
no
moore
has
failed
to
call
our
attention
to
this
fact
did
you
meet
moore
during
the
course
of
your
visit
to
a
neighborhood
over
which
he
seems
to
hold
absolute
sway
not
to
my
knowledge
but
his
house
is
directly
opposite
and
as
he
has
little
to
do
but
amuse
himself
with
what
he
can
see
from
his
front
window
i
concluded
that
he
might
have
observed
me
going
in
you
entered
by
the
front
door
then
how
else
and
on
what
night
jeffrey
made
an
effort
these
questions
were
visibly
harassing
him
the
night
before
the
one
the
one
which
ended
all
my
earthly
happiness
he
added
in
a
low
voice
coroner
cast
a
glance
at
me
i
remembered
the
lack
of
dust
on
the
nest
of
little
tables
from
which
the
upper
one
had
been
drawn
forward
to
hold
the
candelabrum
and
gently
shook
my
head
the
coroner
eyebrows
went
up
but
none
of
his
disbelief
crept
into
his
voice
as
he
made
this
additional
statement
the
night
on
which
you
failed
to
return
to
your
own
house
instantly
jeffrey
betrayed
by
a
nervous
action
which
was
quite
involuntary
that
his
outward
calm
was
slowly
giving
way
under
a
fire
of
questions
for
which
he
had
no
ready
reply
it
was
odd
your
not
going
home
that
night
the
coroner
coldly
pursued
the
misunderstanding
you
had
with
your
wife
immediately
after
breakfast
must
have
been
a
very
serious
one
more
serious
than
you
have
hitherto
acknowledged
i
had
rather
not
discuss
the
subject
protested
jeffrey
then
as
if
he
suddenly
recognized
the
official
character
of
his
interlocutor
he
hastily
added
unless
you
positively
request
me
to
do
so
in
which
case
i
must
i
am
afraid
that
i
must
insist
upon
it
returned
the
other
you
will
find
that
it
will
be
insisted
upon
at
the
inquest
and
if
you
do
not
wish
to
subject
yourself
to
much
unnecessary
unpleasantness
you
had
better
make
clear
to
us
the
cause
of
that
special
quarrel
which
to
all
intents
and
purposes
led
to
your
death
i
will
try
to
do
so
returned
jeffrey
rising
and
pacing
the
room
in
his
intense
restlessness
we
did
have
some
words
her
conduct
the
night
before
had
not
pleased
me
i
am
naturally
jealous
vilely
jealous
and
i
thought
she
was
a
little
frivolous
at
the
german
ambassador
ball
but
i
had
no
idea
she
would
take
my
sharp
speeches
so
much
to
heart
i
had
no
idea
that
she
would
care
so
much
or
that
i
should
care
so
much
a
little
jealousy
is
certainly
pardonable
in
a
bridegroom
and
if
her
mind
had
not
already
been
upset
she
would
have
remembered
how
i
loved
her
and
hopefully
waited
for
a
reconciliation
you
did
love
your
wife
then
it
was
you
and
not
she
who
had
a
right
to
be
jealous
i
have
heard
the
contrary
stated
it
is
a
matter
of
public
gossip
that
you
loved
another
woman
previous
to
your
acquaintance
with
miss
moore
a
woman
whom
your
wife
regarded
with
sisterly
affection
and
subsequently
took
into
her
new
home
miss
tuttle
jeffrey
stopped
in
his
walk
to
fling
out
this
ejaculation
i
admire
and
respect
miss
tuttle
he
went
on
to
declare
but
i
never
loved
her
not
as
i
did
my
wife
he
finished
but
with
a
certain
hard
accent
apparent
enough
to
a
sensitive
ear
pardon
me
it
is
as
difficult
for
me
to
put
these
questions
as
it
is
for
you
to
hear
them
were
you
and
miss
tuttle
ever
engaged
i
started
this
was
a
question
which
half
of
washington
had
been
asking
itself
for
the
last
three
months
would
jeffrey
answer
it
or
remembering
that
these
questions
were
rather
friendly
than
official
refuse
to
satisfy
a
curiosity
which
he
might
well
consider
intrusive
the
set
aspect
of
his
features
promised
little
in
the
way
of
information
and
we
were
both
surprised
when
a
moment
later
he
responded
with
a
grim
emphasis
hardly
to
be
expected
from
one
of
his
impulsive
temperament
unhappily
no
my
attentions
never
went
so
far
instantly
the
coroner
pounced
on
the
one
weak
word
which
jeffrey
had
let
fall
unhappily
he
repeated
why
do
you
say
unhappily
jeffrey
flushed
and
seemed
to
come
out
of
some
dream
did
i
say
unhappily
he
inquired
well
i
repeat
it
miss
tuttle
would
never
have
given
me
any
cause
for
jealousy
the
coroner
bowed
and
for
the
present
dropped
her
name
out
of
the
conversation
you
speak
again
of
the
jealousy
aroused
in
you
by
your
impetuosities
was
this
increased
or
diminished
by
the
tone
of
the
few
lines
she
left
behind
her
the
response
was
long
in
coming
it
was
hard
for
this
man
to
lie
the
struggle
he
made
at
it
was
pitiful
as
i
noted
what
it
cost
him
i
began
to
have
new
and
curious
thoughts
concerning
him
and
the
whole
matter
under
discussion
i
shall
never
overcome
the
remorse
roused
in
me
by
those
few
lines
he
finally
rejoined
she
showed
a
consideration
for
me
what
the
coroner
exclamation
showed
all
the
surprise
he
felt
jeffrey
tottered
under
it
then
grew
slowly
pale
as
if
only
through
our
amazed
looks
he
had
come
to
realize
the
charge
of
inconsistency
to
which
he
had
laid
himself
open
i
mean
he
endeavored
to
explain
that
jeffrey
showed
an
unexpected
tenderness
toward
me
by
taking
all
the
blame
of
our
misunderstanding
upon
herself
it
was
generous
of
her
and
will
do
much
toward
making
my
memory
of
her
a
gentle
one
he
was
forgetting
himself
again
indeed
his
manner
and
attempted
explanations
were
full
of
contradictions
to
emphasize
this
fact
coroner
exclaimed
i
should
think
so
she
paid
a
heavy
penalty
for
her
professed
lack
of
love
you
believe
that
her
mind
was
unseated
does
not
her
action
show
it
unseated
by
the
mishap
occurring
at
her
marriage
yes
you
really
think
that
yes
by
anything
that
passed
between
you
yes
may
i
ask
you
to
tell
us
what
passed
between
you
on
this
point
yes
he
had
uttered
the
monosyllable
so
often
it
seemed
to
come
unconsciously
from
his
lips
but
he
recognized
almost
as
soon
as
we
did
that
it
was
not
a
natural
reply
to
the
last
question
and
making
a
gesture
of
apology
he
added
with
the
same
monotony
of
tone
which
had
characterized
these
replies
she
spoke
of
her
strange
guest
unaccountable
death
more
than
once
and
whenever
she
did
so
it
was
with
an
unnatural
excitement
and
in
an
unbalanced
way
this
was
so
noticeable
to
us
all
that
the
subject
presently
was
tabooed
amongst
us
but
though
she
henceforth
spared
us
all
allusion
to
it
she
continued
to
talk
about
the
house
itself
and
of
the
previous
deaths
which
had
occurred
there
till
we
were
forced
to
forbid
that
topic
also
she
was
never
really
herself
after
crossing
the
threshold
of
this
desolate
house
to
be
married
the
shadow
which
lurks
within
its
walls
fell
at
that
instant
upon
her
life
may
god
have
mercy
the
prayer
remained
unfinished
his
head
which
had
fallen
on
his
breast
sank
lower
he
presented
the
aspect
of
one
who
is
quite
done
with
life
even
its
sorrows
but
men
in
the
position
of
coroner
can
not
afford
to
be
compassionate
everything
the
bereaved
man
said
deepened
the
impression
that
he
was
acting
a
part
to
make
sure
that
this
was
really
so
the
coroner
with
just
the
slightest
touch
of
sarcasm
quietly
observed
and
to
ease
your
wife
mind
the
wife
you
were
so
deeply
angered
with
you
visited
this
house
and
at
an
hour
which
you
should
have
spent
in
reconciliation
with
her
went
through
its
ancient
rooms
in
the
hope
of
what
jeffrey
could
not
answer
the
words
which
came
from
his
lips
were
mere
ejaculations
i
was
restless
mad
i
found
this
adventure
diverting
i
had
no
real
purpose
in
mind
not
when
you
looked
at
the
old
picture
the
old
picture
what
old
picture
the
old
picture
in
the
southwest
chamber
you
took
a
look
at
that
did
you
got
up
on
a
chair
on
purpose
to
do
so
jeffrey
winced
but
he
made
a
direct
reply
yes
i
gave
a
look
at
that
old
picture
got
up
as
you
say
on
a
chair
to
do
so
was
that
the
freak
of
an
idle
man
wandering
he
hardly
knows
why
from
room
to
room
in
an
old
and
deserted
house
his
tormentor
did
not
answer
probably
his
mind
was
on
his
next
line
of
inquiry
but
jeffrey
did
not
take
his
silence
with
the
calmness
he
had
shown
prior
to
the
last
attack
as
no
word
came
from
his
unwelcome
guest
he
paused
in
his
rapid
pacing
and
casting
aside
with
one
impulsive
gesture
his
hitherto
imperfectly
held
restraint
he
cried
out
sharply
why
do
you
ask
me
these
questions
in
tones
of
such
suspicion
is
it
not
plain
enough
that
my
wife
took
her
own
life
under
a
misapprehension
of
my
state
of
mind
toward
her
that
you
should
feel
it
necessary
to
rake
up
these
personal
matters
which
however
interesting
to
the
world
at
large
are
of
a
painful
nature
to
me
jeffrey
retorted
the
other
with
a
sudden
grave
assumption
of
dignity
not
without
its
effect
in
a
case
of
such
serious
import
we
do
nothing
without
purpose
we
ask
these
questions
and
show
this
interest
because
the
charge
of
suicide
which
has
hitherto
been
made
against
your
wife
is
not
entirely
sustained
by
the
facts
at
least
she
was
not
alone
when
she
took
her
life
some
one
was
in
the
house
with
her
it
was
startling
to
observe
the
effect
of
this
declaration
upon
him
impossible
he
cried
out
in
a
protest
as
forcible
as
it
was
agonized
you
are
playing
with
my
misery
she
could
have
had
no
one
there
she
would
not
there
is
not
a
man
living
before
whom
she
would
have
fired
that
deadly
shot
unless
it
was
myself
unless
it
was
my
own
wretched
miserable
self
the
remorseful
whisper
in
which
those
final
words
were
uttered
carried
them
to
my
heart
which
for
some
strange
and
unaccountable
reason
had
been
gradually
turning
toward
this
man
but
my
less
easily
affected
companion
seeing
his
opportunity
and
possibly
considering
that
it
was
this
gentleman
right
to
know
in
what
a
doubtful
light
he
stood
before
the
law
remarked
with
as
light
a
touch
of
irony
as
was
possible
you
should
know
better
than
we
in
whose
presence
she
would
choose
to
die
if
she
did
so
choose
also
who
would
be
likely
to
tie
the
pistol
to
her
wrist
and
blow
out
the
candle
when
the
dreadful
deed
was
over
the
laugh
which
seemed
to
be
the
only
means
of
violent
expression
remaining
to
this
miserable
man
was
kept
down
by
some
amazing
thought
which
seemed
to
paralyze
him
without
making
any
attempt
to
refute
a
suggestion
that
fell
just
short
of
a
personal
accusation
he
sank
down
in
the
first
chair
he
came
to
and
became
as
it
were
lost
in
the
vision
of
that
ghastly
and
the
solitary
blowing
out
of
the
candle
upon
this
scene
of
mournful
death
then
with
a
struggling
sense
of
having
heard
something
which
called
for
answer
he
rose
blindly
to
his
feet
and
managed
to
let
fall
these
words
you
are
mistaken
no
one
was
there
or
if
any
one
was
it
was
not
i
there
is
a
man
in
this
city
who
can
prove
it
but
when
jeffrey
was
asked
to
give
the
name
of
this
man
he
showed
confusion
and
presently
was
obliged
to
admit
that
he
could
neither
recall
his
name
nor
remember
anything
about
him
but
that
he
was
some
one
whom
he
knew
well
and
who
knew
him
well
he
affirmed
that
the
two
had
met
and
spoken
near
soldiers
home
shortly
after
the
sun
went
down
and
that
the
man
would
be
sure
to
remember
this
meeting
if
we
could
only
find
him
as
soldiers
home
was
several
miles
from
the
moore
house
and
quite
out
of
the
way
of
all
his
accustomed
haunts
coroner
asked
him
how
he
came
to
be
there
he
replied
that
he
had
just
come
from
rock
creek
cemetery
that
he
had
been
in
a
wretched
state
of
mind
all
day
and
possibly
being
influenced
by
what
he
had
heard
of
the
yearly
vigils
moore
was
in
the
habit
of
keeping
there
had
taken
a
notion
to
stroll
among
the
graves
in
search
of
the
rest
and
peace
of
mind
he
had
failed
to
find
in
his
aimless
walks
about
the
city
at
least
that
was
the
way
he
chose
to
account
for
the
meeting
he
mentioned
falling
into
reverie
again
he
seemed
to
be
trying
to
recall
the
name
which
at
this
moment
was
of
such
importance
to
him
but
it
was
without
avail
as
he
presently
acknowledged
i
can
not
remember
who
it
was
my
brain
is
whirling
and
i
can
recollect
nothing
but
that
this
man
and
myself
left
the
cemetery
together
on
the
night
mentioned
just
as
the
gate
was
being
closed
as
it
closes
at
sundown
the
hour
can
be
fixed
to
a
minute
it
was
somewhere
near
seven
i
believe
near
enough
i
am
sure
for
it
to
have
been
impossible
for
me
to
be
at
the
moore
house
at
the
time
my
unhappy
wife
is
supposed
to
have
taken
her
life
there
is
no
doubt
about
your
believing
this
he
demanded
with
sudden
haughtiness
as
rising
to
his
feet
he
confronted
us
in
all
the
pride
of
his
exceptionally
handsome
person
we
wish
to
believe
it
assented
the
coroner
rising
in
his
turn
that
our
belief
may
become
certainty
will
you
let
us
know
the
instant
you
recall
the
name
of
the
man
you
talked
with
at
the
cemetery
gate
his
testimony
far
more
than
any
word
of
yours
will
settle
this
question
which
otherwise
may
prove
a
vexed
one
jeffrey
hand
went
up
to
his
head
was
he
acting
a
part
or
did
he
really
forget
just
what
it
was
for
his
own
best
welfare
to
remember
if
he
had
forgotten
it
argued
that
he
was
in
a
state
of
greater
disturbance
on
that
night
than
would
naturally
be
occasioned
by
a
mere
lover
quarrel
with
his
wife
did
the
same
thought
strike
my
companion
i
can
not
say
i
can
only
give
you
his
next
words
you
have
said
that
your
wife
would
not
be
likely
to
end
her
life
in
presence
of
any
one
but
yourself
yet
you
must
see
that
some
one
was
with
her
how
do
you
propose
to
reconcile
your
assertions
with
a
fact
so
undeniable
i
can
not
reconcile
them
it
would
madden
me
to
try
if
i
thought
any
one
was
with
her
at
that
moment
well
jeffrey
eyes
fell
and
a
startling
change
passed
over
him
but
before
either
of
us
could
make
out
just
what
this
change
betokened
he
recovered
his
aspect
of
fixed
melancholy
and
quietly
remarked
it
is
dreadful
to
think
of
her
standing
there
alone
aiming
a
pistol
at
her
young
passionate
heart
but
it
is
worse
to
picture
her
doing
this
under
the
gaze
of
unsympathizing
eyes
i
can
not
and
will
not
so
picture
her
you
have
been
misled
by
appearances
or
what
in
police
parlance
is
called
a
clue
evidently
he
did
not
mean
to
admit
the
possibility
of
the
pistol
having
been
fired
by
any
other
hand
than
her
own
this
the
coroner
noted
bowing
with
the
respect
he
showed
every
man
before
a
jury
had
decided
upon
his
guilt
he
turned
toward
the
door
out
of
which
i
had
already
hurried
we
hope
to
hear
from
you
in
the
morning
he
called
back
significantly
as
he
stepped
down
the
stairs
jeffrey
did
not
answer
he
was
having
his
first
struggle
with
the
new
and
terrible
prospect
awaiting
him
at
the
approaching
inquest
book
ii
the
law
and
its
victim
xi
details
the
days
of
my
obscurity
were
over
henceforth
i
was
regarded
as
a
decided
factor
in
this
case
a
case
which
from
this
time
on
assumed
another
aspect
both
at
headquarters
and
in
the
minds
of
people
at
large
the
reporters
whom
we
had
hitherto
managed
to
hold
in
check
now
overflowed
both
the
coroner
office
and
police
headquarters
and
articles
appeared
in
all
the
daily
papers
with
just
enough
suggestion
in
them
to
fire
the
public
mind
and
make
me
for
one
anticipate
an
immediate
word
from
jeffrey
calculated
to
establish
the
alibi
he
had
failed
to
make
out
on
the
day
we
talked
with
him
but
no
such
word
came
his
memory
still
played
him
false
and
no
alternative
was
left
but
to
pursue
the
official
inquiry
in
the
line
suggested
by
the
interview
just
recounted
no
proceeding
in
which
i
had
ever
been
engaged
interested
me
as
did
this
inquest
in
the
first
place
the
spectators
were
of
a
very
different
character
from
the
ordinary
as
i
wormed
myself
along
to
the
seat
accorded
to
such
witnesses
as
myself
i
brushed
by
men
of
the
very
highest
station
and
a
few
of
the
lowest
and
bent
my
head
more
than
once
in
response
to
the
inquiring
gaze
of
some
fashionable
lady
who
never
before
i
warrant
had
found
herself
in
such
a
scene
by
the
time
i
reached
my
place
all
the
others
were
seated
and
the
coroner
rapped
for
order
i
was
first
to
take
the
stand
what
i
said
has
already
been
fully
amplified
in
the
foregoing
pages
of
course
my
evidence
was
confined
to
facts
but
some
of
these
facts
were
new
to
most
of
the
persons
there
it
was
evident
that
a
considerable
effect
was
produced
by
them
not
only
on
the
spectators
but
upon
the
witnesses
themselves
for
instance
it
was
the
first
time
that
the
marks
on
the
had
been
heard
of
outside
the
office
or
the
story
so
told
as
to
make
it
evident
that
jeffrey
could
not
have
been
alone
in
the
house
at
the
time
of
her
death
a
photograph
had
been
taken
of
those
marks
and
my
identification
of
this
photograph
closed
my
testimony
as
i
returned
to
my
seat
i
stole
a
look
toward
a
certain
corner
where
with
face
bent
down
upon
his
hand
francis
jeffrey
sat
between
uncle
david
and
the
figure
of
miss
tuttle
had
there
dawned
upon
him
as
my
testimony
was
given
any
suspicion
of
the
trick
by
which
he
had
been
proved
responsible
for
those
marks
it
was
impossible
to
tell
from
the
way
miss
tuttle
head
was
turned
toward
him
one
might
judge
him
to
be
laboring
under
an
emotion
of
no
ordinary
character
though
he
sat
like
a
statue
and
hardly
seemed
to
realize
how
many
eyes
were
at
that
moment
riveted
upon
his
face
i
was
followed
by
other
detectives
who
had
been
present
at
the
time
and
who
corroborated
my
statement
as
to
the
appearance
of
this
unhappy
woman
and
the
way
the
pistol
had
been
tied
to
her
arm
then
the
doctor
who
had
acted
under
the
coroner
was
called
after
a
long
and
no
doubt
learned
description
of
the
bullet
wound
which
had
ended
the
life
of
this
unhappy
lady
a
wound
which
he
insisted
with
a
marked
display
of
learning
must
have
made
that
end
instantaneous
or
at
least
too
immediate
for
her
to
move
foot
or
hand
after
it
he
was
asked
if
the
body
showed
any
other
mark
of
violence
to
this
he
replied
there
was
a
minute
wound
at
the
base
of
one
of
her
fingers
the
one
which
is
popularly
called
the
wedding
finger
this
statement
made
all
the
women
present
start
with
renewed
interest
nor
was
it
altogether
without
point
for
the
men
especially
when
the
doctor
went
on
to
say
the
hands
were
entirely
without
rings
as
jeffrey
had
been
married
with
a
ring
i
noticed
their
absence
was
this
wound
which
you
characterize
as
minute
a
recent
one
it
had
bled
a
little
it
was
an
abrasion
such
as
would
be
made
if
the
ring
she
usually
wore
there
had
been
drawn
off
with
a
jerk
that
was
the
impression
i
received
from
its
appearance
i
do
not
state
that
it
was
so
made
a
little
thrill
which
went
over
the
audience
at
the
picture
this
evoked
communicated
itself
to
miss
tuttle
who
trembled
violently
it
even
produced
a
slight
display
of
emotion
in
jeffrey
whose
hand
shook
where
he
pressed
it
against
his
forehead
but
neither
uttered
a
sound
nor
looked
up
when
the
next
witness
was
summoned
this
witness
proved
to
be
loretta
who
on
hearing
her
name
called
evinced
great
reluctance
to
come
forward
but
after
two
or
three
words
uttered
in
her
ear
by
the
friendly
jinny
who
had
been
given
a
seat
next
her
she
stepped
into
the
place
assigned
her
with
a
suddenly
assumed
air
of
great
boldness
which
sat
upon
her
with
scant
grace
she
had
need
of
all
the
boldness
at
her
command
for
the
eyes
of
all
in
the
room
were
fixed
on
her
with
the
exception
of
the
two
persons
most
interested
in
her
testimony
scrutiny
of
any
kind
did
not
appear
to
be
acceptable
to
her
if
one
could
read
the
trepidation
visible
in
the
short
quick
upheavals
of
the
broad
collar
which
covered
her
uneasy
breast
was
this
shrinking
on
her
part
due
to
natural
timidity
or
had
she
failings
to
avow
which
while
not
vitiating
her
testimony
would
certainly
cause
her
shame
in
the
presence
of
so
many
men
and
women
i
was
not
able
to
decide
this
question
immediately
for
after
the
coroner
had
elicited
her
name
and
the
position
she
held
in
jeffrey
household
he
asked
whether
her
duties
took
her
into
jeffrey
room
upon
her
replying
that
they
did
he
further
inquired
if
she
knew
jeffrey
rings
and
could
say
whether
they
were
all
to
be
found
on
that
lady
after
the
police
came
in
with
news
of
her
death
the
answer
was
decisive
they
were
all
there
her
rings
and
all
the
other
ornaments
she
was
in
the
daily
habit
of
wearing
with
the
exception
of
her
watch
that
was
not
there
did
you
take
up
those
rings
no
sir
did
you
see
any
one
else
take
them
up
no
sir
not
till
the
officer
did
so
very
well
loretta
sit
down
again
till
we
hear
what
durbin
has
to
say
about
these
rings
and
then
the
man
i
hated
came
forward
and
though
i
shrank
from
acknowledging
it
even
to
myself
i
could
but
observe
how
strong
and
quiet
and
he
seemed
and
how
decisive
was
his
testimony
but
it
was
equally
brief
he
had
taken
up
the
rings
and
he
had
looked
at
them
and
on
one
the
he
had
detected
a
slight
stain
of
blood
he
had
called
attention
to
it
but
that
gentleman
had
made
no
comment
this
remark
had
the
effect
of
concentrating
general
attention
upon
jeffrey
but
he
seemed
quite
oblivious
of
it
his
attitude
remained
unchanged
and
only
from
the
quick
stretching
out
and
withdrawal
of
miss
tuttle
hand
could
it
be
seen
that
anything
had
been
said
calculated
to
touch
or
arouse
this
man
the
coroner
cast
an
uneasy
glance
in
his
direction
then
he
motioned
durbin
aside
and
recalled
loretta
and
now
i
began
to
be
sorry
for
the
girl
it
is
hard
to
have
weaknesses
exposed
especially
if
one
is
more
foolish
than
wicked
but
there
was
no
way
of
letting
this
girl
off
without
sacrificing
certain
necessary
points
and
the
coroner
went
relentlessly
to
work
how
long
have
you
been
in
this
house
three
weeks
ever
since
jeffrey
wedding
day
sir
were
you
there
when
she
first
came
as
a
bride
from
the
moore
house
i
was
sir
and
saw
her
then
for
the
first
time
yes
sir
how
did
she
look
and
act
that
first
day
i
thought
her
the
gayest
bride
i
had
ever
seen
then
i
thought
her
the
saddest
and
then
i
did
not
know
what
to
think
she
was
so
merry
one
minute
and
so
frightened
the
next
so
full
of
talk
when
she
came
running
up
the
steps
and
so
struck
with
silence
the
minute
she
got
into
the
parlor
that
i
set
her
down
as
a
queer
one
till
some
one
whispered
in
my
ear
that
she
was
suffering
from
a
dreadful
shock
that
had
attended
her
marriage
and
much
more
about
what
had
happened
from
time
to
time
at
the
moore
house
and
you
believed
what
was
told
you
believed
believed
it
well
enough
to
keep
a
watch
on
your
young
mistress
to
see
if
she
were
happy
or
not
oh
sir
it
was
but
natural
the
coroner
suavely
observed
every
one
felt
interested
in
this
marriage
you
watched
her
of
course
now
what
was
the
result
did
you
consider
her
well
and
happy
the
girl
voice
sank
and
she
cast
a
glance
at
her
master
which
he
did
not
lift
his
head
to
meet
i
did
not
think
her
happy
she
laughed
and
sang
and
was
always
in
and
out
of
the
rooms
like
a
butterfly
but
she
did
not
wear
a
happy
look
except
now
and
then
when
she
was
seated
with
jeffrey
alone
then
i
have
seen
her
flush
in
a
way
to
make
the
heart
ache
it
was
such
a
contrast
sir
to
other
times
when
she
was
by
herself
or
or
what
or
just
with
her
sister
sir
the
defiance
with
which
this
was
said
added
point
to
what
otherwise
might
have
been
an
unimportant
admission
those
who
had
already
scrutinized
miss
tuttle
with
the
curiosity
of
an
suspicion
now
scrutinized
her
with
a
more
palpable
one
and
those
who
had
hitherto
seen
nothing
in
this
woman
but
the
bereaved
sister
of
an
irresponsible
suicide
allowed
their
looks
to
dwell
piercingly
on
that
concealing
veil
as
if
they
would
be
glad
to
penetrate
its
folds
and
read
in
those
beautiful
features
the
meaning
of
an
allusion
uttered
with
such
a
sting
in
the
tone
you
refer
to
miss
tuttle
observed
the
coroner
jeffrey
sister
yes
sir
the
menace
was
gone
from
the
voice
now
but
no
one
could
forget
that
it
had
been
there
miss
tuttle
lived
in
the
house
with
her
sister
did
she
not
yes
sir
till
that
sister
died
and
was
buried
then
she
went
away
the
coroner
did
not
pursue
this
topic
preferring
to
return
to
the
former
one
so
you
say
that
jeffrey
showed
uneasiness
ever
since
her
wedding
day
can
you
give
me
any
instance
of
this
mention
i
mean
any
conversations
overheard
by
you
which
would
show
us
just
what
you
mean
i
do
like
to
repeat
things
i
hear
but
if
you
say
that
i
must
i
can
remember
once
passing
and
jeffrey
in
the
hall
just
as
he
was
saying
take
it
too
much
to
heart
i
expected
a
happy
honeymoon
somehow
we
have
failed
that
was
all
i
heard
sir
but
what
made
me
remember
his
words
was
that
she
was
dressed
for
some
afternoon
reception
and
looked
so
charming
and
so
and
so
as
if
she
ought
to
be
happier
just
so
now
when
was
this
how
long
before
her
death
oh
a
week
or
so
it
was
very
soon
after
the
wedding
day
and
did
matters
seem
to
improve
after
that
did
she
appear
any
better
satisfied
or
more
composed
i
think
she
endeavored
to
but
there
was
something
on
her
mind
something
which
she
tried
to
laugh
off
something
that
annoyed
jeffrey
and
worried
miss
tuttle
something
which
caused
a
cloud
in
the
house
for
all
the
dances
and
dinners
and
goings
and
comings
i
am
sorry
to
speak
of
it
but
it
was
so
something
that
showed
an
unsettled
mind
almost
the
glitter
in
her
eye
was
not
natural
neither
was
the
way
she
looked
at
her
sister
and
sometimes
at
her
husband
did
she
talk
much
about
the
catastrophe
which
attended
her
wedding
did
her
mind
seem
to
run
on
that
incessantly
at
first
but
afterward
not
so
much
i
think
jeffrey
frowned
on
that
subject
did
he
ever
frown
on
her
no
sir
not
not
when
they
were
alone
or
with
no
one
by
but
me
he
seemed
to
love
her
then
very
much
what
do
you
mean
by
that
loretta
that
he
lost
patience
with
her
when
other
people
were
present
miss
tuttle
for
instance
yes
sir
he
used
to
change
very
much
when
when
when
miss
tuttle
came
into
the
room
change
toward
his
wife
yes
sir
how
he
grew
more
distant
much
more
distant
got
up
quite
fretfully
from
his
seat
if
he
were
sitting
beside
her
and
took
up
some
book
or
paper
and
miss
tuttle
she
never
seemed
to
notice
but
but
she
did
not
come
in
very
often
after
this
had
happened
once
or
twice
i
mean
into
the
room
upstairs
where
they
used
to
sit
loretta
i
regret
to
put
this
question
but
after
your
replies
i
owe
it
to
the
jury
if
not
to
the
parties
themselves
to
make
miss
tuttle
position
in
this
household
thoroughly
understood
do
you
think
she
was
a
welcome
visitor
in
this
house
the
girl
pursed
up
her
lips
glanced
at
the
lady
and
gentleman
whose
feelings
she
was
supposed
to
pass
comment
on
and
seemed
to
lose
heart
then
as
they
failed
to
respond
to
her
look
of
appeal
she
strove
to
get
the
better
of
her
sense
of
shame
and
with
a
somewhat
injured
air
replied
i
can
only
repeat
what
i
once
heard
said
about
this
by
jeffrey
himself
miss
tuttle
had
just
left
the
diningroom
and
jeffrey
was
standing
in
one
of
her
black
moods
with
her
hand
on
the
top
of
her
chair
ready
to
go
but
forgetting
to
do
so
i
was
there
but
neither
of
them
noticed
me
he
was
staring
at
her
and
she
was
looking
down
neither
seemed
at
ease
suddenly
he
spoke
and
asked
must
cora
remain
with
us
she
started
and
her
look
grew
strange
and
frightened
i
want
her
to
she
cried
can
not
live
without
cora
these
words
so
different
from
what
we
were
expecting
caused
a
sensation
in
the
room
and
consequently
a
stir
as
the
noise
of
shifting
feet
and
moving
heads
began
to
be
heard
in
all
directions
miss
tuttle
head
drooped
a
little
but
francis
jeffrey
did
not
betray
any
sign
of
feeling
or
even
of
attention
the
coroner
embarrassed
perhaps
by
this
exhibition
of
silent
misery
so
near
him
hesitated
a
little
before
he
put
his
next
question
loretta
on
the
contrary
had
gathered
courage
with
every
word
she
spoke
and
now
looked
ready
for
anything
it
was
jeffrey
then
who
clung
most
determinedly
to
her
sister
the
coroner
finally
suggested
i
have
told
you
what
she
said
yet
these
sisters
spent
but
little
time
together
very
little
as
little
as
two
persons
could
who
lived
together
in
one
house
this
statement
which
seemed
such
a
contradiction
to
her
former
one
increased
the
interest
and
much
disappointment
was
covertly
shown
when
the
coroner
veered
off
from
this
topic
and
brusquely
inquired
did
you
ever
know
and
jeffrey
to
have
any
open
rupture
the
answer
was
a
decided
one
yes
on
tuesday
morning
preceding
her
death
they
had
a
long
and
angry
talk
in
their
own
room
after
which
jeffrey
made
no
further
effort
to
conceal
her
wretchedness
indeed
one
may
say
she
began
to
die
from
that
hour
jeffrey
death
had
occurred
on
wednesday
evening
let
us
hear
what
you
have
to
say
about
this
quarrel
and
what
happened
after
it
the
girl
with
a
renewed
flush
cast
a
deprecatory
look
at
the
mass
of
faces
before
her
and
meeting
on
all
sides
but
one
look
of
intense
and
growing
interest
drew
up
her
neat
figure
with
a
relieved
air
and
began
a
story
which
i
will
proceed
to
transcribe
for
you
in
the
fewest
possible
words
tuesday
morning
breakfast
had
been
a
silent
one
there
had
been
a
ball
the
night
before
at
some
great
place
on
massachusetts
avenue
but
no
one
spoke
of
it
miss
tuttle
made
some
remark
about
a
friend
she
had
met
there
but
as
no
one
listened
to
her
she
soon
stopped
and
in
a
little
while
left
the
table
and
jeffrey
sat
on
but
neither
said
anything
finally
jeffrey
rose
and
speaking
in
a
voice
hardly
recognizable
remarked
that
he
had
something
to
say
to
her
and
led
the
way
to
their
room
jeffrey
looked
frightened
as
she
followed
him
so
frightened
that
it
was
evident
that
something
very
serious
had
occurred
or
was
about
to
occur
between
them
as
nothing
of
this
kind
had
ever
happened
before
loretta
could
not
help
waiting
about
till
jeffrey
reappeared
and
when
he
did
so
and
she
saw
no
signs
of
relief
in
his
face
or
manner
she
watched
with
the
silly
interest
of
a
girl
who
had
nothing
else
to
occupy
her
mind
to
see
if
he
would
leave
the
house
in
such
a
mood
and
without
making
peace
with
his
young
bride
to
her
surprise
he
did
not
go
out
at
the
usual
time
but
went
to
miss
tuttle
room
where
for
a
full
he
remained
closeted
with
his
talking
in
excited
and
unnatural
tones
then
he
went
back
for
a
few
minutes
to
where
he
had
left
his
wife
in
her
own
boudoir
but
he
could
not
have
had
much
to
say
to
her
this
time
for
he
presently
came
out
again
and
ran
hastily
downstairs
and
out
almost
without
stopping
to
catch
up
his
hat
as
it
was
mary
business
and
not
the
witness
to
make
jeffrey
bed
in
the
morning
loretta
could
think
of
no
excuse
for
approaching
her
mistress
room
at
this
moment
but
later
when
letters
came
followed
by
various
messages
and
some
visitors
she
went
more
than
a
dozen
times
to
jeffrey
door
she
was
not
admitted
nor
were
her
appeals
answered
except
by
a
sharp
go
away
nor
was
miss
tuttle
received
any
better
though
she
tried
more
than
once
to
see
her
sister
especially
as
night
came
on
and
the
hour
approached
for
jeffrey
return
jeffrey
was
simply
determined
to
remain
alone
and
when
dinner
time
arrived
and
no
jeffrey
she
could
be
induced
to
open
her
door
only
wide
enough
to
take
in
the
cup
of
tea
which
miss
tuttle
insisted
upon
sending
her
the
witness
here
confessed
that
she
had
been
very
much
excited
by
these
unusual
proceedings
and
by
the
effect
which
they
seemed
to
have
on
the
lady
just
mentioned
so
she
was
ready
to
notice
that
jeffrey
hand
shook
like
that
of
an
old
and
palsied
woman
when
she
reached
out
for
the
tray
gladly
would
loretta
have
caught
one
glimpse
of
her
face
but
it
was
hidden
by
the
door
nor
did
jeffrey
answer
a
single
one
of
her
questions
she
simply
closed
her
door
and
kept
it
so
till
toward
midnight
when
miss
tuttle
coming
into
the
hall
ordered
the
house
to
be
closed
for
the
night
then
the
door
softly
swung
open
but
before
any
one
could
reach
it
it
was
again
pulled
to
and
locked
the
next
day
brought
no
relief
miss
tuttle
who
had
changed
greatly
during
this
unhappy
day
and
night
succeeded
no
better
than
before
in
getting
access
to
her
sister
nor
could
loretta
gain
the
least
word
from
her
mistress
till
toward
the
latter
part
of
the
afternoon
when
that
lady
ringing
her
bell
gave
her
first
order
a
substantial
dinner
she
cried
and
when
loretta
greatly
relieved
brought
up
the
required
meal
she
was
astonished
to
find
the
door
open
and
herself
bidden
to
enter
the
sight
which
met
her
eyes
staggered
her
from
one
end
of
the
room
to
the
other
were
signs
of
great
nervous
unrest
and
of
terrible
suffering
the
chairs
were
pushed
into
corners
as
if
the
wretched
bride
had
tramped
the
floor
in
an
agony
of
excitement
curtains
were
torn
and
the
was
hanging
half
on
and
half
off
the
open
upright
as
if
she
had
clutched
at
it
to
keep
herself
from
falling
on
the
floor
beneath
lay
several
pieces
of
broken
china
vases
of
whose
value
jeffrey
had
often
spoken
but
which
jerked
off
with
the
cover
had
been
left
where
they
fell
while
immediately
in
front
of
the
fireplace
lay
one
of
the
rugs
tossed
into
a
heap
as
if
she
had
rolled
in
it
on
the
floor
or
used
it
to
smother
her
cries
of
pain
or
anger
so
much
for
the
state
in
which
the
witness
found
the
boudoir
the
adjoining
was
not
in
much
better
case
though
it
was
evident
that
the
bed
itself
had
not
been
lain
in
since
it
was
made
up
the
day
before
at
breakfast
time
by
this
token
jeffrey
had
not
slept
the
night
before
or
if
she
had
laid
her
head
anywhere
it
had
been
on
the
rug
already
spoken
of
these
signs
of
extreme
mental
suffering
so
much
more
extreme
than
any
loretta
had
ever
before
witnessed
frightened
her
so
that
the
tray
shook
in
her
hand
as
she
set
it
down
on
the
table
among
the
countless
objects
jeffrey
always
had
about
her
the
noise
seemed
to
startle
her
mistress
who
had
walked
to
the
window
after
opening
the
door
for
she
wheeled
impetuously
about
and
loretta
saw
her
face
it
was
as
if
a
blight
had
passed
over
it
once
gay
and
animated
beyond
the
power
of
any
one
to
describe
it
had
become
in
hours
a
ghost
face
with
the
glare
of
some
awful
resolve
on
it
or
so
it
would
appear
from
the
way
loretta
described
it
but
such
girls
do
not
always
see
correctly
and
perhaps
all
that
can
be
safely
stated
is
that
jeffrey
was
unnaturally
pale
and
had
lost
her
way
of
incessant
movement
loretta
who
was
evidently
accustomed
to
seeing
her
mistress
arrayed
in
brilliant
colors
and
much
begemmed
laid
great
stress
on
the
fact
that
though
it
was
on
the
verge
of
evening
and
she
was
evidently
going
out
she
was
dressed
in
black
cloth
and
without
even
a
diamond
or
a
flower
to
relieve
its
severe
simplicity
her
hair
too
which
was
always
her
pride
was
piled
in
a
careless
mass
upon
her
head
as
if
she
had
tried
to
arrange
it
herself
and
had
forgotten
what
she
was
doing
while
her
fingers
were
but
half
through
their
work
there
was
a
cloak
lying
on
a
chair
near
which
she
was
standing
and
she
held
a
hat
in
her
band
but
loretta
saw
no
gloves
as
the
glance
and
that
of
her
mistress
crossed
jeffrey
spoke
and
the
effort
she
made
in
doing
so
naturally
frightened
the
girl
still
more
i
am
going
out
were
her
words
i
may
not
be
home
till
late
what
are
you
looking
at
loretta
declared
that
the
words
took
her
by
surprise
and
that
she
did
not
know
what
to
say
but
managed
to
cover
up
her
embarrassment
by
intimating
that
if
her
mistress
would
let
her
touch
up
her
hair
a
bit
she
would
make
her
look
more
natural
at
this
suggestion
jeffrey
cast
a
glance
in
the
glass
and
impetuously
declared
it
does
matter
but
she
seemed
to
think
better
of
it
the
next
minute
for
throwing
herself
in
a
chair
she
bade
the
girl
to
bring
a
comb
and
sat
quiet
enough
though
evidently
in
a
great
tremor
of
haste
and
impatience
while
loretta
combed
her
hair
and
put
it
up
in
the
old
way
but
the
old
way
was
not
as
becoming
as
usual
and
loretta
was
wondering
if
she
ought
to
call
in
miss
tuttle
when
jeffrey
jumped
to
her
feet
and
went
over
to
the
table
and
began
to
eat
with
the
feverish
haste
of
one
who
forces
himself
to
take
food
in
spite
of
hurry
and
distaste
this
was
the
moment
for
loretta
to
leave
the
room
but
she
did
not
know
how
to
do
so
she
felt
herself
fixed
to
the
spot
and
stood
watching
jeffrey
till
that
lady
suddenly
becoming
conscious
of
the
girl
presence
turned
and
in
the
midst
of
the
moans
which
broke
unconsciously
from
her
lips
said
with
a
pitiable
effort
at
her
old
manner
go
away
loretta
i
am
ill
have
been
ill
for
two
days
i
like
people
to
look
at
me
like
that
then
as
the
girl
shrank
back
added
in
a
breaking
voice
when
jeffrey
comes
home
and
said
no
more
for
several
minutes
during
which
she
clutched
her
throat
with
both
hands
and
struggled
with
herself
till
she
got
her
voice
back
and
found
herself
able
to
repeat
when
jeffrey
comes
if
he
does
come
tell
him
that
i
was
right
about
the
way
that
novel
ended
remember
that
you
are
to
say
to
him
the
moment
you
see
him
that
i
was
right
about
the
novel
and
that
he
is
to
look
and
see
if
it
did
not
end
as
i
said
it
would
and
loretta
here
she
rose
and
approached
the
speaker
with
a
sweet
appealing
look
which
brought
tears
to
the
impressionable
girl
eyes
do
go
gossiping
about
me
downstairs
i
be
sick
long
i
am
going
to
be
better
soon
very
soon
by
the
time
you
see
me
here
again
i
shall
be
quite
like
my
old
self
forget
how
how
and
loretta
said
she
seemed
to
have
difficulty
in
finding
the
right
word
here
how
childish
i
have
been
of
course
loretta
promised
but
she
is
not
sure
that
she
would
have
had
the
courage
to
keep
all
this
to
herself
if
she
had
not
heard
jeffrey
stop
in
miss
tuttle
room
on
her
way
out
that
relieved
her
and
enabled
her
to
go
downstairs
to
her
own
supper
with
more
appetite
than
she
had
thought
ever
to
have
again
alas
it
was
the
last
good
meal
she
was
able
to
eat
for
days
in
three
hours
afterward
a
man
came
from
the
station
house
with
the
news
of
jeffrey
suicide
in
the
horrible
old
house
in
which
she
had
been
married
only
two
weeks
before
as
this
had
been
a
continuous
narrative
and
concisely
told
the
coroner
had
not
interrupted
her
when
at
this
point
a
little
gasp
escaped
miss
tuttle
and
a
groan
broke
from
francis
hitherto
sealed
lips
the
feelings
of
the
whole
assemblage
seemed
to
find
utterance
a
young
wife
misery
culminating
in
death
on
the
very
spot
where
she
had
been
so
lately
married
what
could
be
more
thrilling
or
appeal
more
closely
to
the
general
heart
of
humanity
but
the
cause
of
that
misery
this
was
what
every
one
present
was
eager
to
have
explained
this
is
what
we
now
expected
the
coroner
to
bring
out
but
instead
of
continuing
on
the
line
he
had
opened
up
he
proceeded
to
ask
where
were
you
when
this
officer
brought
the
news
you
mention
in
the
hall
sir
i
opened
the
door
for
him
and
to
whom
did
he
first
mention
his
errand
to
miss
tuttle
she
had
come
in
just
before
him
and
was
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
what
was
miss
tuttle
out
that
evening
yes
she
went
out
very
soon
after
jeffrey
left
when
she
came
in
she
said
that
she
had
been
around
the
block
but
she
must
have
gone
around
it
more
than
once
for
she
was
absent
two
hours
did
you
let
her
in
yes
sir
and
she
said
she
had
been
around
the
block
yes
sir
did
she
say
anything
else
she
asked
if
jeffrey
had
come
in
anything
else
then
if
jeffrey
had
returned
to
both
of
which
questions
you
answered
a
plain
now
tell
us
about
the
officer
he
rang
the
bell
almost
immediately
after
she
did
thinking
she
would
want
to
slip
upstairs
before
i
admitted
any
one
i
waited
a
minute
for
her
to
go
but
she
did
not
do
so
and
when
the
officer
stepped
in
she
well
she
shrieked
what
before
he
spoke
yes
sir
just
at
sight
of
him
yes
sir
did
he
wear
his
badge
in
plain
view
yes
on
his
breast
so
that
you
knew
him
to
be
a
police
officer
yes
and
miss
tuttle
shrieked
at
seeing
a
police
officer
yes
and
sprang
forward
did
she
say
anything
not
then
what
did
she
do
waited
for
him
to
speak
which
he
did
at
once
and
very
brutally
he
asked
if
she
was
sister
and
when
she
nodded
and
gasped
he
blurted
out
that
jeffrey
was
dead
that
he
had
just
come
from
the
old
house
in
waverley
avenue
where
she
had
just
been
found
and
miss
tuttle
did
know
what
to
say
just
hid
her
face
she
was
leaning
against
the
so
it
was
easy
for
her
to
do
so
i
remember
that
the
man
stared
at
her
for
taking
it
so
quietly
and
asking
no
questions
and
did
she
speak
at
all
oh
yes
afterwards
her
face
was
wrapped
in
the
folds
of
her
cloak
but
i
heard
her
whisper
as
if
to
herself
no
that
old
hearth
is
not
a
lodestone
she
can
not
have
fallen
there
and
then
she
looked
up
quite
wildly
and
cried
is
something
more
something
which
you
have
not
told
me
shot
herself
if
that
what
you
mean
miss
tuttle
arms
went
straight
up
over
her
head
it
was
awful
to
see
her
herself
she
gasped
veronica
veronica
a
pistol
he
went
on
i
suppose
he
was
going
to
say
to
her
wrist
but
he
never
got
it
out
for
miss
tuttle
at
the
word
clapped
her
hands
to
her
ears
and
for
a
moment
looked
quite
distracted
so
that
he
thought
better
of
worrying
her
any
more
and
only
demanded
to
know
if
jeffrey
kept
any
such
weapon
miss
tuttle
face
grew
very
strange
at
this
jeffrey
was
he
there
she
asked
the
man
looked
surprised
are
searching
for
jeffrey
he
replied
he
here
came
both
from
her
lips
and
mine
the
man
acted
very
impertinently
have
told
me
whether
a
pistol
was
kept
here
or
not
said
he
miss
tuttle
tried
to
compose
herself
but
i
saw
that
i
should
have
to
speak
if
any
one
did
so
i
told
him
that
jeffrey
did
have
a
pistol
which
he
kept
in
one
of
his
bureau
drawers
but
when
the
officer
wanted
miss
tuttle
to
go
up
and
see
if
it
was
there
she
shook
her
head
and
made
for
the
front
door
saying
that
she
must
be
taken
directly
to
her
sister
and
did
no
one
go
up
was
no
attempt
made
to
see
if
the
pistol
was
or
was
not
in
the
drawer
yes
the
officer
went
up
with
me
i
pointed
out
the
place
where
it
was
kept
and
he
rummaged
all
through
it
but
found
no
pistol
i
did
expect
him
to
here
the
witness
paused
and
bit
her
lip
adding
confusedly
jeffrey
had
taken
it
you
see
the
jurors
who
sat
very
much
in
the
shadow
had
up
to
this
point
attracted
but
little
attention
but
now
they
began
to
make
their
presence
felt
perhaps
because
the
break
in
the
witness
words
had
been
accompanied
by
a
sly
look
at
jinny
possibly
warned
by
this
that
something
lay
back
of
this
hitherto
timid
witness
sudden
volubility
one
of
them
now
spoke
up
in
what
room
did
you
say
this
pistol
was
kept
in
and
jeffrey
sir
the
room
opening
out
of
the
where
jeffrey
had
kept
herself
shut
up
all
day
does
this
of
which
you
speak
communicate
with
the
hall
as
well
as
with
the
sitting
room
no
sir
it
is
the
defect
of
the
house
and
jeffrey
often
spoke
of
it
as
a
great
annoyance
you
had
to
pass
through
the
little
boudoir
in
order
to
reach
it
the
juryman
sank
back
evidently
satisfied
with
her
replies
but
we
who
marked
the
visible
excitement
with
which
the
witness
had
answered
this
seemingly
unimportant
question
wondered
what
special
interest
surrounded
that
room
and
the
pistol
to
warrant
the
heightened
color
with
which
the
girl
answered
this
new
interlocutor
we
were
not
destined
to
know
at
this
time
for
the
coroner
when
he
spoke
again
pursued
a
different
subject
how
long
was
this
before
jeffrey
came
in
only
a
few
minutes
i
was
terribly
frightened
at
being
left
there
alone
and
was
on
my
way
to
ask
one
of
the
other
girls
to
come
up
and
stay
with
me
when
i
heard
his
key
in
the
lock
and
came
back
he
had
entered
the
house
and
was
standing
near
the
door
talking
to
an
officer
who
had
evidently
come
in
with
him
it
was
a
different
officer
from
the
one
who
had
gone
away
with
miss
tuttle
jeffrey
was
saying
that
my
wife
hurt
sir
blurted
out
the
man
i
had
expected
to
see
jeffrey
terribly
shocked
but
not
in
so
awful
a
way
it
really
frightened
me
to
see
him
and
i
turned
to
run
but
found
that
i
could
and
that
i
had
to
stand
still
and
look
whether
i
wanted
to
or
not
yet
he
did
say
a
word
or
ask
a
question
what
did
he
do
loretta
i
can
not
say
he
was
on
his
knees
and
was
white
oh
how
white
yet
he
looked
up
when
the
man
described
how
and
where
jeffrey
had
been
found
and
even
turned
toward
me
when
i
said
something
about
his
wife
having
left
a
message
for
him
when
she
went
out
this
message
which
i
almost
hesitated
to
give
after
the
awful
news
of
her
death
was
about
the
ending
of
some
story
as
you
remember
and
it
seemed
heartless
to
speak
of
it
at
a
moment
like
this
but
as
she
had
told
me
to
i
did
dare
to
disobey
her
so
with
the
man
listening
to
my
every
word
and
jeffrey
looking
as
if
he
would
fall
to
the
ground
before
i
could
finish
i
repeated
her
words
to
him
and
was
surprised
enough
when
he
suddenly
started
upright
and
went
flying
upstairs
but
i
was
more
surprised
yet
when
at
the
top
of
the
first
flight
he
stopped
and
looking
over
the
balustrade
asked
in
a
very
strange
voice
where
miss
tuttle
was
for
he
seemed
just
then
to
want
her
more
than
anything
else
in
the
world
and
looked
beaten
and
wild
when
i
told
him
that
she
was
already
gone
to
waverley
avenue
but
he
recovered
himself
before
the
man
could
draw
near
enough
to
see
his
face
and
rushed
into
the
above
and
shut
the
door
behind
him
leaving
the
officer
and
me
standing
down
by
the
front
door
as
i
know
what
to
say
to
a
man
like
him
and
he
did
know
what
to
say
to
me
the
time
seemed
long
but
it
could
have
been
very
many
minutes
before
jeffrey
came
back
with
a
slip
of
paper
in
his
hand
and
a
very
much
relieved
look
on
his
face
deed
was
premeditated
he
cried
unfortunate
wife
has
misunderstood
my
affection
for
her
and
from
being
a
very
much
man
he
stood
up
straight
and
tall
and
prepared
himself
very
quietly
to
go
to
the
moore
house
that
is
all
i
can
tell
about
the
way
the
news
was
received
by
him
were
these
details
necessary
many
appeared
to
regard
them
as
futile
and
uncalled
for
but
coroner
was
never
known
to
waste
time
on
trivialities
and
if
he
called
for
these
facts
those
who
knew
him
best
felt
certain
that
they
were
meant
as
a
preparation
for
jeffrey
testimony
which
was
now
called
for
xii
thrust
and
parry
when
francis
jeffrey
hand
fell
from
his
forehead
and
he
turned
to
face
the
assembled
people
an
instinctive
compassion
arose
in
every
breast
at
sight
of
his
face
which
if
not
open
in
its
expression
was
at
least
surcharged
with
the
deepest
misery
in
a
flash
the
scene
took
on
new
meaning
many
remembered
that
less
than
a
month
before
his
eye
had
been
joyous
and
his
figure
a
conspicuous
one
among
the
favored
sons
of
fortune
and
now
he
stood
in
sight
of
a
crowd
drawn
together
mainly
by
curiosity
to
explain
as
best
he
might
why
this
great
happiness
and
hope
had
come
to
a
sudden
termination
and
his
bride
of
a
fortnight
had
sought
death
rather
than
continue
to
live
under
the
same
roof
with
him
so
much
for
what
i
saw
on
the
faces
about
me
what
my
own
face
revealed
i
can
not
say
i
only
know
that
i
strove
to
preserve
an
impassive
exterior
if
i
secretly
held
this
man
misery
to
be
a
mask
hiding
untold
passions
and
the
darkness
of
an
unimaginable
deed
it
was
not
for
me
to
disclose
in
this
presence
either
my
suspicions
or
my
fears
to
me
as
to
those
about
me
he
apparently
was
a
man
who
at
some
sacrifice
to
his
pride
would
yet
be
able
to
explain
whatever
seemed
dubious
in
the
mysterious
case
in
which
he
had
become
involved
his
wife
uncle
who
to
all
appearance
shared
the
general
curiosity
as
to
the
effect
which
this
woeful
tragedy
had
had
upon
his
most
interested
survivor
eyed
with
a
certain
cold
interest
eminently
in
keeping
with
his
general
character
the
pallid
forehead
sunken
eyes
and
nervously
trembling
lip
of
the
once
handsome
jeffrey
till
that
gentleman
rousing
from
his
depression
manifested
a
realization
of
what
was
required
of
hire
and
turned
with
a
bow
toward
the
coroner
miss
tuttle
settled
into
a
greater
rigidity
i
pass
over
the
preliminary
examination
of
this
important
witness
and
proceed
at
once
to
the
point
when
the
coroner
holding
out
the
two
or
three
lines
of
writing
which
jeffrey
had
declared
to
have
been
left
him
by
his
wife
asked
are
these
words
in
your
wife
handwriting
jeffrey
replied
hastily
and
with
just
a
glance
at
the
paper
offered
him
they
are
the
coroner
pressed
the
slip
upon
him
look
at
them
carefully
he
urged
the
handwriting
shows
hurry
and
in
places
is
scarcely
legible
are
you
ready
to
swear
that
these
words
were
written
by
your
wife
and
by
no
other
jeffrey
with
just
a
slight
contraction
of
his
brow
expressive
of
annoyance
did
as
he
was
bid
he
scanned
or
appeared
to
scan
the
small
scrap
of
paper
which
he
now
took
into
his
own
hand
it
is
my
wife
writing
he
impatiently
declared
written
as
all
can
see
under
great
agitation
of
mind
but
hers
without
any
doubt
will
you
read
aloud
these
words
for
our
benefit
asked
the
coroner
it
was
a
cruel
request
causing
an
instinctive
protest
from
the
spectators
but
no
protest
disturbed
coroner
z
he
had
his
reasons
no
doubt
for
thus
trying
this
witness
and
when
coroner
had
reason
for
anything
it
took
more
than
the
displeasure
of
the
crowd
to
deter
him
jeffrey
who
had
subdued
whatever
indignation
he
may
have
felt
at
this
unmistakable
proof
of
the
coroner
intention
to
have
his
own
way
with
him
whatever
the
cost
to
his
sensitiveness
or
pride
obeyed
the
latter
command
in
firmer
tones
than
i
expected
the
lines
he
was
thus
called
upon
to
read
may
bear
repetition
i
find
that
i
do
not
love
you
as
i
thought
i
can
not
live
knowing
this
to
be
so
pray
god
you
may
forgive
me
veronica
as
the
last
word
fell
with
a
little
tremble
from
jeffrey
lips
the
coroner
repeated
you
still
think
these
words
were
addressed
to
you
by
your
wife
that
in
short
they
contain
an
explanation
of
her
death
i
do
there
was
sharpness
in
the
tone
jeffrey
was
feeling
the
prick
there
was
agitation
in
it
too
an
agitation
he
was
trying
hard
to
keep
down
you
have
reason
then
persisted
the
coroner
for
accepting
this
peculiar
explanation
of
your
wife
death
a
death
which
in
the
judgment
of
most
people
was
of
a
nature
to
call
for
the
strongest
provocation
possible
my
wife
was
not
herself
my
wife
was
in
an
over
strained
and
suffering
condition
for
one
so
nervously
overwrought
many
allowances
must
be
made
she
may
have
been
conscious
of
not
responding
fully
to
my
affection
that
this
feeling
was
strong
enough
to
induce
her
to
take
her
life
is
a
source
of
unspeakable
grief
to
me
but
one
for
which
you
must
find
explanation
as
i
have
so
often
said
in
the
terrors
caused
by
the
dread
event
at
the
moore
house
which
recalled
old
tragedies
and
emphasized
a
most
unhappy
family
tradition
the
coroner
paused
a
moment
to
let
these
words
sink
into
the
ears
of
the
jury
then
plunged
immediately
into
what
might
be
called
the
offensive
part
of
his
examination
why
if
your
wife
death
caused
you
such
intense
grief
did
you
appear
so
relieved
at
receiving
this
by
no
means
consoling
explanation
at
an
implication
so
unmistakably
suggestive
of
suspicion
jeffrey
showed
fire
for
the
first
time
whose
word
have
you
for
that
a
servant
so
newly
come
into
my
house
that
her
very
features
are
still
strange
to
me
you
must
acknowledge
that
a
person
of
such
marked
inexperience
can
hardly
be
thought
to
know
me
or
to
interpret
rightly
the
feelings
of
my
heart
by
any
passing
look
she
may
have
surprised
upon
my
face
this
attitude
of
defiance
so
suddenly
assumed
had
an
effect
he
little
realized
miss
tuttle
stirred
for
the
first
time
behind
her
veil
and
uncle
david
from
looking
bored
became
suddenly
quite
attentive
these
two
but
mirrored
the
feelings
of
the
general
crowd
and
mine
especially
we
do
not
depend
on
her
judgment
alone
the
coroner
now
remarked
the
change
in
you
was
apparent
to
many
others
this
we
can
prove
to
the
jury
if
they
require
it
but
no
man
lifting
a
voice
from
that
gravely
attentive
body
the
coroner
proceeded
to
inquire
if
jeffrey
felt
like
volunteering
any
explanations
on
this
head
receiving
no
answer
from
him
either
he
dropped
the
suggestive
line
of
inquiry
and
took
up
the
consideration
of
facts
the
first
question
he
now
put
was
where
did
you
find
the
slip
of
paper
containing
these
last
words
from
your
wife
in
a
book
i
picked
out
of
the
in
our
room
upstairs
when
loretta
gave
me
my
wife
message
i
knew
that
i
should
find
some
word
from
her
in
the
novel
we
had
just
been
reading
as
we
had
been
interested
in
but
one
book
since
our
marriage
there
was
no
possibility
of
my
making
an
mistake
as
to
which
one
she
referred
will
you
give
us
the
name
of
this
novel
compensation
and
you
found
this
book
called
compensation
in
your
room
upstairs
yes
on
the
yes
where
does
this
stand
jeffrey
looked
up
as
much
as
to
say
why
so
many
small
questions
about
so
simple
a
matter
but
answered
frankly
enough
at
the
right
of
the
door
leading
into
the
bedroom
and
at
right
angles
to
the
door
leading
into
the
hall
yes
very
good
now
may
i
ask
you
to
describe
the
cover
of
this
book
the
cover
i
never
noticed
the
cover
why
do
you
excuse
me
i
suppose
you
have
your
reasons
for
asking
even
these
puerile
and
seemingly
unnecessary
questions
the
cover
is
a
queer
one
i
believe
partly
red
and
partly
green
and
that
is
all
i
know
about
it
is
this
the
book
jeffrey
glanced
at
the
volume
the
coroner
held
up
before
him
i
believe
so
it
looks
like
it
the
book
had
a
flaming
cover
quite
unmistakable
in
its
character
the
title
shows
it
to
be
the
same
remarked
the
coroner
is
this
the
only
book
with
a
cover
of
this
kind
in
the
house
the
only
one
i
should
say
the
coroner
laid
down
the
book
enough
of
this
then
for
the
present
only
let
the
jury
remember
that
the
cover
of
this
book
is
peculiar
and
that
it
was
kept
on
a
shelf
at
the
right
of
the
opening
leading
into
the
adjoining
and
now
jeffrey
we
must
ask
you
to
look
at
these
rings
or
rather
at
this
one
you
have
seen
it
before
it
is
the
one
you
placed
on
jeffrey
hand
when
you
were
married
to
her
a
little
over
a
fortnight
ago
you
recognize
it
i
do
do
you
also
recognize
this
small
mark
of
blood
on
it
as
having
been
here
when
it
was
shown
to
you
by
the
detective
on
your
return
from
seeing
her
dead
body
at
the
moore
house
i
do
yes
how
do
you
account
for
that
spot
and
the
slight
injury
made
to
her
finger
should
you
not
say
that
the
ring
had
been
dragged
from
her
hand
i
should
by
whom
was
it
dragged
by
you
no
sir
by
herself
then
it
would
seem
so
much
passion
must
have
been
in
that
act
do
you
think
that
any
ordinary
quarrel
between
husband
and
wife
would
account
for
the
display
of
such
fury
are
we
not
right
in
supposing
a
deeper
cause
for
the
disturbance
between
you
than
the
slight
one
you
offer
in
way
of
explanation
an
inaudible
answer
then
a
sudden
straightening
of
francis
fine
figure
and
that
was
all
jeffrey
in
the
talk
you
had
with
your
wife
on
tuesday
morning
was
miss
tuttle
name
introduced
it
was
mentioned
yes
sir
with
recrimination
or
any
display
of
passion
on
the
part
of
your
wife
you
would
not
believe
me
if
i
said
no
was
the
unexpected
rejoinder
the
coroner
taken
aback
by
this
direct
attack
from
one
who
had
hitherto
borne
all
his
innuendoes
with
apparent
patience
lost
countenance
for
a
moment
but
remembering
that
in
his
official
capacity
he
was
more
than
a
match
for
the
elegant
gentleman
who
under
other
circumstances
would
have
found
it
only
too
easy
to
put
him
to
the
blush
he
observed
with
dignity
jeffrey
you
are
on
oath
we
certainly
have
no
reason
for
not
believing
you
jeffrey
bowed
he
was
probably
sorry
for
his
momentary
loss
of
and
gravely
but
with
eyes
bent
downward
answered
with
the
abrupt
phrase
well
then
i
will
say
no
the
coroner
shifted
his
ground
will
you
make
the
same
reply
when
i
ask
if
the
like
forbearance
was
shown
toward
your
wife
name
in
the
conversation
you
had
with
miss
tuttle
immediately
afterward
a
halt
in
the
eagerly
reply
a
hesitation
momentary
indeed
but
pregnant
with
nameless
suggestions
caused
his
answer
when
it
did
come
to
lose
some
of
the
emphasis
he
manifestly
wished
to
put
into
it
miss
tuttle
was
jeffrey
the
bond
between
them
was
strong
would
she
would
i
be
apt
to
speak
of
my
young
wife
with
bitterness
that
is
not
an
answer
to
my
question
jeffrey
i
must
request
a
more
positive
reply
miss
tuttle
made
a
move
the
strain
on
all
present
was
so
great
we
could
but
notice
it
he
noticed
it
too
for
his
brows
came
together
with
a
quick
frown
as
he
emphatically
replied
there
were
no
recriminations
uttered
jeffrey
had
displeased
me
and
i
said
so
but
i
did
not
forget
that
i
was
speaking
of
my
wife
and
to
her
sister
as
this
was
in
the
highest
degree
the
coroner
could
be
excused
for
persisting
the
conversation
then
was
about
your
wife
it
was
in
criticism
of
her
conduct
yes
at
the
ambassador
ball
yes
jeffrey
was
a
poor
hand
at
lying
that
last
yes
came
with
great
effort
the
coroner
waited
possibly
for
the
echo
of
this
last
yes
to
cease
then
he
remarked
with
a
coldness
which
lifted
at
once
the
veil
from
his
hitherto
well
disguised
antagonism
to
this
witness
if
you
will
recount
to
us
anything
which
your
wife
said
or
did
on
that
evening
which
in
your
mind
was
worthy
of
all
this
coil
it
might
help
us
to
understand
the
situation
but
the
witness
made
no
attempt
to
do
so
and
while
many
of
us
were
ready
to
pardon
him
this
show
of
delicacy
others
felt
that
under
the
circumstances
it
would
have
been
better
had
he
been
more
open
among
the
latter
was
the
coroner
himself
who
from
this
moment
threw
aside
all
hesitation
and
urged
forward
his
inquiries
in
a
way
to
press
the
witness
closer
and
closer
toward
the
net
he
was
secretly
holding
out
for
him
first
he
obliged
him
to
say
that
his
conversation
with
miss
tuttle
had
not
tended
to
smooth
matters
that
no
reconciliation
with
his
wife
had
followed
it
and
that
in
the
hours
which
elapsed
before
he
returned
home
again
he
had
made
no
attempt
to
soothe
the
feelings
of
one
who
according
to
his
own
story
he
considered
hardly
responsible
for
any
extravagances
in
which
she
might
have
indulged
then
when
this
inconsistency
had
been
given
time
to
sink
into
the
minds
of
the
jury
coroner
increased
the
effect
produced
by
confronting
jeffrey
with
witnesses
who
testified
to
the
friendly
if
not
relations
which
had
existed
between
himself
and
miss
tuttle
prior
to
the
appearance
of
his
wife
upon
the
scene
closing
with
a
question
which
brought
out
the
denial
by
no
means
new
that
an
engagement
had
ever
taken
place
between
him
and
miss
tuttle
and
hence
that
a
bond
had
been
canceled
by
his
marriage
with
miss
moore
but
his
manner
and
careful
choice
of
words
in
making
this
denial
did
not
satisfy
those
present
of
his
entire
candor
especially
as
miss
tuttle
for
all
her
apparent
immobility
showed
by
the
violent
locking
of
her
hands
both
her
anxiety
and
the
suffering
she
was
undergoing
during
this
painful
examination
was
the
suffering
merely
one
of
outraged
delicacy
we
felt
justified
in
doubting
it
and
looked
forward
with
cruel
curiosity
i
admit
to
the
moment
when
this
renowned
and
universally
admired
beauty
would
be
called
on
to
throw
aside
her
veil
axed
reveal
the
highly
praised
features
which
had
been
so
openly
scorned
for
the
sake
of
one
whose
chief
claims
to
regard
lay
in
her
great
wealth
but
this
moment
was
as
yet
far
distant
the
coroner
was
a
man
of
method
and
his
plan
was
now
to
prove
as
had
been
apparent
to
most
of
us
from
the
first
that
the
assumption
of
suicide
on
the
part
of
jeffrey
was
open
to
doubt
the
communication
suggesting
such
an
end
to
her
troubles
was
the
strongest
proof
jeffrey
could
bring
forward
that
her
death
had
been
the
result
of
her
own
act
consequently
it
was
now
the
coroner
business
to
show
that
this
communication
was
either
a
forgery
or
a
substitution
and
that
if
she
left
some
word
in
the
book
to
which
she
had
in
so
peculiar
a
manner
directed
his
attention
it
was
not
necessarily
the
one
bewailing
her
absence
of
love
for
him
and
her
consequent
intention
of
seeking
relief
from
her
disappointment
in
death
some
hint
of
what
the
coroner
contemplated
had
already
escaped
him
in
the
persistent
and
seemingly
inconsequent
questions
to
which
he
had
subjected
this
witness
in
reference
to
these
very
matters
but
the
time
had
now
come
for
a
more
direct
attack
and
the
interest
rose
correspondingly
high
when
the
coroner
lifting
again
to
sight
the
scrap
of
paper
containing
the
few
piteous
lines
so
often
quoted
asked
of
the
now
anxious
and
agitated
witness
if
he
had
ever
noticed
any
similarity
between
the
handwriting
of
his
wife
and
that
of
miss
tuttle
an
indignant
no
was
about
to
pass
his
lips
when
he
suddenly
checked
himself
and
said
more
mildly
there
may
have
been
a
similarity
i
hardly
know
i
have
seen
too
little
of
miss
hand
to
judge
this
occasioned
a
diversion
specimens
of
miss
tuttle
handwriting
were
produced
which
after
having
been
duly
proved
were
passed
down
to
the
jury
along
with
the
communication
professedly
signed
by
jeffrey
the
grunts
of
astonishment
which
ensued
as
the
knowing
heads
drew
near
over
these
several
papers
caused
jeffrey
to
flush
and
finally
to
cry
out
with
startling
emphasis
i
know
that
those
words
were
written
by
my
wife
but
when
the
coroner
asked
him
his
reasons
for
this
conviction
he
could
or
would
not
state
them
i
have
said
he
stolidly
repeated
and
that
was
all
the
coroner
made
no
comment
but
when
after
some
further
inquiry
which
added
little
to
the
general
knowledge
he
dismissed
jeffrey
and
recalled
loretta
there
was
that
in
his
tone
which
warned
us
that
the
really
serious
portion
of
the
day
examination
was
about
to
begin
xiii
chiefly
thrust
the
appearance
of
this
witness
had
undergone
a
change
since
she
last
stood
before
us
she
was
still
but
her
manner
showed
resolve
and
a
feverish
determination
to
face
the
situation
which
could
but
awaken
in
the
breasts
of
those
who
had
honor
and
personal
welfare
at
heart
a
nameless
dread
as
if
they
already
foresaw
the
dark
shadow
which
minute
by
minute
was
slowly
sinking
over
a
household
which
up
to
a
week
ago
had
been
the
envy
and
admiration
of
all
washington
society
the
first
answer
she
made
revealed
both
the
cause
of
her
shame
and
the
reason
of
her
firmness
it
was
in
response
to
the
question
whether
she
loretta
had
seen
miss
tuttle
before
she
went
out
on
the
walk
she
was
said
to
have
taken
immediately
after
final
departure
from
the
house
her
words
were
these
i
did
sir
i
do
not
think
miss
tuttle
knows
it
but
i
saw
her
in
jeffrey
room
the
emphatic
tone
offering
such
a
contrast
to
her
former
manner
of
speech
might
have
drawn
all
eyes
to
the
speaker
had
not
the
person
she
mentioned
offered
a
still
more
interesting
subject
to
the
general
curiosity
as
it
was
all
glances
flew
to
that
silent
and
seemingly
impassive
figure
upon
which
all
open
suggestions
and
covert
innuendo
had
hitherto
fallen
without
creating
more
than
a
pressure
of
her
interlaced
fingers
this
direct
attack
possibly
the
most
threatening
she
had
received
appeared
to
produce
no
more
effect
upon
her
than
the
others
less
perhaps
for
no
stir
was
visible
in
her
now
and
to
some
eyes
she
hardly
seemed
to
breathe
curiosity
thus
baffled
led
the
gaze
on
to
jeffrey
and
even
to
uncle
david
but
the
former
had
dropped
his
head
again
upon
his
hand
and
the
other
well
there
was
little
to
observe
in
moore
at
any
time
save
the
immense
satisfaction
he
seemed
to
take
in
himself
so
attention
returned
to
the
witness
who
by
this
time
had
entered
upon
a
consecutive
tale
as
near
as
i
can
remember
these
are
the
words
with
which
she
prefaced
it
i
am
not
especially
proud
of
what
i
did
that
night
but
i
was
led
into
it
by
degrees
and
i
am
sure
i
beg
the
lady
pardon
and
then
she
went
on
to
relate
how
after
she
had
seen
jeffrey
leave
the
house
she
went
into
her
room
with
the
intention
of
putting
it
to
rights
as
this
was
no
more
than
her
duty
no
fault
could
be
found
with
her
but
she
owned
that
when
she
had
finished
this
task
and
removed
all
evidence
of
jeffrey
frenzied
condition
she
had
no
business
to
linger
at
the
table
turning
over
the
letters
she
found
lying
there
here
the
coroner
stopped
her
and
made
some
inquiries
in
regard
to
these
letters
but
as
they
seemed
to
be
ordinary
epistles
from
friends
and
quite
foreign
to
the
investigation
he
allowed
her
to
proceed
her
cheeks
were
burning
now
for
she
had
found
herself
obliged
to
admit
that
she
had
read
enough
of
these
letters
to
be
sure
that
they
had
no
reference
to
the
quarrel
then
pending
between
her
mistress
and
jeffrey
her
eyes
fell
and
she
looked
seriously
distressed
as
she
went
on
to
say
that
she
was
as
conscious
then
as
now
of
having
no
business
with
these
papers
so
conscious
indeed
that
when
she
heard
miss
tuttle
step
at
the
door
her
one
idea
was
to
hide
herself
that
she
could
stand
and
face
that
lady
never
so
much
as
occurred
to
her
her
own
guilty
consciousness
made
her
cheeks
too
hot
for
her
to
wish
to
meet
an
eye
which
had
never
rested
on
her
any
too
kindly
so
noticing
how
straight
the
curtains
fell
over
one
of
the
windows
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
she
dashed
toward
it
and
slipped
in
out
of
sight
just
as
miss
tuttle
came
in
this
window
was
one
seldom
used
owing
to
the
fact
that
it
overlooked
an
adjoining
wall
so
she
had
no
fear
of
miss
tuttle
approaching
it
consequently
she
could
stand
there
quite
at
her
ease
and
as
the
curtains
in
falling
behind
her
had
not
come
quite
together
she
really
could
not
help
seeing
just
what
that
lady
did
here
the
witness
paused
with
every
appearance
of
looking
for
some
token
of
disapprobation
from
the
crowd
but
she
encountered
nothing
there
but
eager
anxiety
for
her
to
proceed
so
without
waiting
for
the
coroner
question
she
added
in
so
many
words
she
went
first
to
the
we
had
expected
it
but
yet
a
general
movement
took
place
and
a
few
suppressed
exclamations
could
be
heard
and
what
did
she
do
there
took
down
a
book
after
looking
carefully
up
and
down
the
shelves
what
color
of
book
a
green
one
with
red
figures
on
it
i
could
see
the
cover
plainly
as
she
took
it
down
like
this
one
exactly
like
that
one
and
what
did
she
do
with
this
book
opened
it
but
not
to
read
it
she
was
too
quick
in
closing
it
for
that
did
she
take
the
book
away
no
she
put
it
back
on
the
shelf
after
opening
and
closing
it
yes
sir
did
you
see
whether
she
put
anything
into
the
book
i
can
not
swear
that
she
did
but
then
her
back
was
to
me
and
i
could
not
have
seen
it
if
she
had
the
implied
suggestion
caused
some
excitement
but
the
coroner
frowning
on
this
pressed
the
girl
to
continue
asking
if
miss
tuttle
left
the
room
immediately
after
turning
from
the
loretta
replied
no
that
on
the
contrary
she
stood
for
some
minutes
near
them
gazing
in
what
seemed
like
a
great
distress
of
mind
straight
upon
the
floor
after
which
she
moved
in
an
agitated
way
and
with
more
than
one
anxious
look
behind
her
into
the
adjoining
room
where
she
paused
before
a
large
bureau
as
this
bureau
was
devoted
entirely
to
jeffrey
use
loretta
experienced
some
surprise
at
seeing
his
wife
sister
approach
it
in
so
stealthy
a
manner
consequently
she
was
watching
with
all
her
might
when
this
young
lady
opened
the
upper
drawer
and
with
very
evident
emotion
thrust
her
hand
into
it
what
she
took
out
or
whether
she
took
out
anything
this
spy
upon
her
movements
could
not
say
for
when
loretta
heard
the
drawer
being
pushed
back
into
place
she
drew
the
curtains
close
perceiving
that
miss
tuttle
would
have
to
face
this
window
in
coming
back
however
she
ventured
upon
one
other
peep
through
them
just
as
that
lady
was
leaving
the
room
and
remembered
as
if
it
were
yesterday
how
her
face
looked
and
how
she
held
her
left
hand
pressed
close
against
the
folds
of
her
dress
it
was
but
a
few
minutes
after
this
that
miss
tuttle
left
the
house
as
we
all
knew
what
was
kept
in
that
drawer
the
conclusion
was
obvious
whatever
excuse
miss
tuttle
might
give
for
going
into
her
sister
room
at
this
time
but
one
thought
one
fear
or
possibly
one
hope
could
have
taken
her
to
jeffrey
private
drawer
she
wished
to
see
if
his
pistol
was
still
there
or
if
it
had
been
taken
away
by
her
sister
a
revelation
of
the
extreme
point
to
which
her
thoughts
had
flown
at
this
crisis
and
one
which
effectually
contradicted
her
former
statement
that
she
had
been
conscious
of
no
alarm
in
behalf
of
her
sister
and
had
seen
her
leave
the
house
without
dread
or
suspicion
of
evil
the
temerity
which
had
made
it
possible
to
associate
the
name
of
such
a
man
as
francis
jeffrey
with
an
outrageous
crime
having
been
thus
in
a
measure
explained
the
coroner
recalled
that
gentleman
and
again
thoroughly
surprised
the
gaping
public
had
the
witness
accompanied
his
wife
to
the
moore
house
no
had
he
met
her
there
by
any
appointment
he
had
made
with
her
or
which
had
been
made
for
them
both
by
some
third
person
no
had
he
been
at
the
moore
house
on
the
night
of
the
eleventh
at
any
time
previous
to
the
hour
when
he
was
brought
there
by
the
officials
no
would
he
glance
at
this
impression
of
certain
which
had
been
left
in
the
dust
of
the
southwest
chamber
mantel
he
had
already
noted
them
now
would
he
place
his
left
hand
on
the
paper
and
see
it
is
not
necessary
he
burst
forth
in
great
heat
i
own
to
those
marks
that
is
i
have
no
doubt
they
were
made
by
my
hand
here
unconsciously
his
eyes
flew
to
the
member
thus
referred
to
as
if
conscious
that
in
some
way
it
had
proved
a
traitor
to
him
after
which
his
gaze
traveled
slowly
my
way
with
an
indescribable
question
in
it
which
roused
my
conscience
and
made
the
trick
by
which
i
had
got
the
impression
of
his
hand
seem
less
of
a
triumph
than
i
had
heretofore
considered
it
the
next
minute
he
was
answering
the
coroner
under
oath
very
much
as
he
had
answered
him
in
the
unofficial
interview
at
which
i
had
been
present
i
acknowledge
having
been
in
the
moore
house
and
even
having
been
in
its
southwest
chamber
but
not
at
the
time
supposed
it
was
on
the
previous
night
he
went
on
to
relate
how
being
in
a
nervous
condition
and
having
the
key
to
this
old
dwelling
in
his
pocket
he
had
amused
himself
by
going
through
its
dilapidated
interior
all
of
this
made
a
doubtful
impression
which
was
greatly
emphasized
when
in
reply
to
the
inquiry
as
to
where
he
got
the
light
to
see
by
he
admitted
that
he
had
come
upon
a
candle
in
an
upstairs
room
and
made
use
of
that
though
he
could
not
remember
what
he
had
done
with
this
candle
afterward
and
looked
dazed
and
quite
at
sea
till
the
coroner
suggested
that
he
might
have
carried
it
into
the
closet
of
the
room
where
his
fingers
had
left
their
impression
in
the
dust
of
the
then
he
broke
down
like
a
man
from
whom
some
prop
is
suddenly
snatched
and
looked
around
for
a
seat
this
was
given
him
while
a
silence
the
most
dreadful
i
ever
experienced
held
every
one
there
in
check
but
he
speedily
rallied
and
with
the
remark
that
he
was
a
little
confused
in
regard
to
the
incidents
of
that
night
waited
with
a
wild
look
in
his
averted
eye
for
the
coroner
next
question
unhappily
for
him
it
was
in
continuation
of
the
same
subject
had
he
bought
candles
or
not
at
the
grocer
around
the
corner
yes
he
had
before
visiting
the
house
yes
had
he
also
bought
matches
yes
what
kind
common
safety
matches
had
he
noticed
when
he
got
home
that
the
box
he
had
just
bought
was
half
empty
no
nevertheless
he
had
used
many
matches
in
going
through
this
old
house
had
he
not
possibly
to
light
his
way
upstairs
perhaps
it
might
be
had
he
not
so
used
them
yes
why
had
he
done
so
if
he
had
candles
in
his
pocket
which
were
so
much
easier
to
hold
and
so
much
more
lasting
than
a
lighted
match
ah
he
could
not
say
he
did
not
know
his
mind
was
confused
he
was
awake
when
he
should
have
been
asleep
it
was
all
a
dream
to
him
the
coroner
became
still
more
persistent
did
you
enter
the
library
on
your
solitary
visit
to
this
old
house
i
believe
so
what
did
you
do
there
pottered
around
i
do
remember
what
light
did
you
use
a
candle
i
think
you
must
know
well
i
had
a
candle
it
was
in
a
candelabrum
what
candle
and
what
candelabrum
the
same
i
used
upstairs
of
course
and
you
can
not
remember
where
you
left
this
candle
and
candelabrum
when
you
finally
quitted
the
house
no
i
was
thinking
about
candles
what
were
you
thinking
about
the
rupture
with
my
wife
and
the
bad
name
of
the
house
i
was
in
oh
and
this
was
on
tuesday
night
yes
sir
how
can
you
prove
this
to
us
i
can
not
but
you
swear
i
swear
that
it
was
tuesday
night
the
night
immediately
preceding
the
one
when
when
my
wife
death
robbed
me
of
all
earthly
happiness
it
was
feelingly
uttered
and
several
faces
lightened
but
the
coroner
repeating
is
there
no
way
you
can
prove
this
to
our
satisfaction
the
shadow
settled
again
and
on
no
head
more
perceptibly
than
on
that
of
the
unfortunate
witness
it
was
now
late
in
the
day
and
the
atmosphere
of
the
room
had
become
stifling
but
no
one
seemed
to
be
conscious
of
any
discomfort
and
a
general
gasp
of
excitement
passed
through
the
room
when
the
coroner
taking
out
a
box
from
under
a
pile
of
papers
disclosed
to
the
general
gaze
the
famous
white
ribbon
with
its
dainty
bow
lying
on
top
of
the
fatal
pistol
that
this
special
feature
the
most
interesting
one
of
all
connected
with
this
tragedy
should
have
been
kept
so
long
in
reserve
and
brought
out
just
at
this
time
struck
many
of
jeffrey
closest
friends
as
unnecessarily
dramatic
but
when
the
coroner
lifting
out
the
ribbon
remarked
tentatively
you
know
this
ribbon
we
were
more
struck
by
the
involuntary
cry
of
surprise
which
rose
from
some
one
in
the
crowd
about
the
door
than
by
the
look
with
which
jeffrey
eyed
it
and
made
the
necessary
reply
that
cry
had
something
more
than
nervous
excitement
in
it
identifying
the
person
who
had
uttered
it
as
a
certain
busy
little
woman
well
known
in
town
i
sent
an
officer
to
watch
her
then
recalled
my
attention
to
the
point
the
coroner
was
attempting
to
make
he
had
forced
jeffrey
to
recognize
the
ribbon
as
the
one
which
had
fastened
the
pistol
to
his
wife
arm
now
he
asked
whether
in
his
opinion
a
woman
could
tie
such
a
bow
to
her
own
wrist
and
when
in
common
justice
jeffrey
was
obliged
to
say
no
waited
a
third
time
before
he
put
the
general
suspicion
again
into
words
can
not
you
by
some
means
or
some
witness
prove
to
us
that
it
was
on
tuesday
night
and
not
on
wednesday
you
spent
the
hours
you
speak
of
on
this
scene
of
your
marriage
and
your
wife
death
the
hopelessness
which
more
than
once
had
marked
features
since
the
beginning
of
this
inquiry
reappeared
with
renewed
force
as
this
suggestive
question
fell
again
upon
his
ears
and
he
was
about
to
repeat
his
plea
of
forgetfulness
when
the
attention
was
diverted
by
a
request
made
in
his
ear
by
one
of
the
detectives
in
another
moment
jeffrey
had
been
waved
aside
and
a
new
witness
sworn
in
you
can
imagine
every
one
surprise
mine
most
of
all
when
this
witness
proved
to
be
uncle
david
xiv
tallman
let
us
have
tallman
i
do
not
know
why
the
coroner
had
so
long
delayed
to
call
this
witness
in
the
ordinary
course
of
events
his
testimony
should
have
preceded
mine
but
the
ordinary
course
of
events
had
not
been
followed
and
it
was
only
at
the
request
of
moore
himself
that
he
was
now
allowed
the
privilege
of
appearing
before
this
coroner
and
jury
i
speak
of
it
as
a
privilege
because
he
himself
evidently
regarded
it
as
such
indeed
his
whole
attitude
and
bearing
as
he
addressed
himself
to
the
coroner
showed
that
he
was
there
to
be
looked
at
and
that
he
secretly
thought
he
was
very
well
worth
this
attention
possibly
some
remembrance
of
the
old
days
in
which
he
had
gone
in
and
out
before
these
people
in
a
garb
suggestive
of
penury
made
the
moment
when
he
could
appear
before
them
in
a
guise
more
befitting
his
station
one
of
incalculable
importance
to
him
at
all
events
he
confronted
us
all
with
an
aspect
which
openly
challenged
admiration
when
in
answer
to
the
coroner
inquiries
it
became
his
duty
to
speak
he
did
so
with
a
condescension
which
would
have
called
up
smiles
if
the
occasion
had
been
one
of
less
seriousness
and
his
connection
with
it
as
unimportant
as
he
would
have
it
appear
what
he
said
was
in
the
way
of
confirming
the
last
testimony
as
to
his
having
been
at
the
moore
house
on
tuesday
evening
moore
who
was
very
particular
as
to
dates
and
days
admitted
that
the
light
which
he
had
seen
in
a
certain
window
of
his
ancestral
home
on
the
evening
when
he
summoned
the
police
was
but
the
repetition
of
one
he
had
detected
there
the
evening
before
it
was
this
repetition
which
alarmed
him
and
caused
him
to
break
through
all
his
usual
habits
and
leave
his
home
at
night
to
notify
the
police
the
old
sneak
thought
i
why
did
he
tell
us
this
before
and
i
allowed
myself
afresh
doubt
of
his
candor
which
had
always
seemed
to
me
somewhat
open
to
question
it
is
possible
that
the
coroner
shared
my
opinion
or
that
he
felt
it
incumbent
upon
him
to
get
what
evidence
he
could
from
the
sole
person
living
within
view
of
the
house
in
which
such
ghastly
events
had
taken
place
for
without
betraying
the
least
suspicion
and
yet
with
the
quiet
persistence
for
which
men
in
his
responsible
position
are
noted
he
subjected
this
suave
old
man
to
such
a
rigid
examination
as
to
what
he
had
seen
or
had
not
seen
from
his
windows
that
no
possibility
seemed
to
remain
of
his
concealing
a
single
fact
which
could
help
to
the
elucidation
of
this
or
any
other
mystery
connected
with
the
old
mansion
he
asked
him
if
he
had
seen
jeffrey
go
in
on
the
night
in
question
if
he
had
ever
seen
any
one
go
in
there
since
the
wedding
or
even
if
he
had
seen
any
one
loitering
about
the
steps
or
sneaking
into
the
rear
yard
but
the
answer
was
always
no
these
same
noes
growing
more
and
more
emphatic
and
the
gentleman
more
and
more
impenetrable
and
dignified
as
the
examination
went
on
in
fact
he
was
as
unassailable
a
witness
as
i
have
ever
heard
testify
before
any
jury
beyond
the
fact
already
mentioned
of
his
having
observed
a
light
in
the
opposite
house
on
the
two
evenings
in
question
he
admitted
nothing
his
life
in
the
little
cottage
was
so
engrossing
he
had
his
organ
his
dog
why
should
he
look
out
of
the
window
had
it
not
been
for
his
usual
habit
of
letting
his
dog
run
the
pavements
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
finally
locking
up
for
the
night
he
would
not
have
seen
as
much
as
he
did
have
you
any
stated
hour
for
doing
this
the
coroner
now
asked
yes
nine
and
was
this
the
hour
when
you
caw
that
light
yes
both
times
as
he
had
appeared
at
the
at
a
few
minutes
before
ten
he
was
probably
correct
in
this
statement
but
notwithstanding
this
i
did
not
feel
implicit
confidence
in
him
he
was
too
insistent
in
his
regret
at
not
being
able
to
give
greater
assistance
in
the
disentanglement
of
a
mystery
so
affecting
the
honor
of
the
family
of
which
he
was
now
the
recognized
head
his
voice
nicely
attuned
to
the
occasion
was
admirable
so
was
his
manner
but
i
mentally
wrote
him
down
as
one
i
should
enjoy
outwitting
if
the
opportunity
ever
came
my
way
he
wound
up
with
such
a
distinct
repetition
of
his
former
emphatic
assertion
as
to
the
presence
of
light
in
the
old
house
on
tuesday
as
well
as
wednesday
evening
that
jeffrey
testimony
in
this
regard
received
a
decided
confirmation
i
looked
to
see
some
open
recognition
of
this
when
suddenly
and
with
a
persistence
understood
only
by
the
police
the
coroner
recalled
jeffrey
and
asked
him
what
proof
he
had
to
offer
that
his
visit
of
tuesday
had
not
been
repeated
the
next
night
and
that
he
was
not
in
the
building
when
that
fatal
trigger
was
pulled
at
this
leading
question
a
lawyer
sitting
near
me
edged
himself
forward
as
if
he
hoped
for
some
sign
from
jeffrey
which
would
warrant
him
in
interfering
but
jeffrey
gave
no
such
sign
i
doubt
if
he
even
noticed
this
man
proximity
though
he
knew
him
well
and
had
often
employed
him
as
his
legal
adviser
in
times
gone
by
he
was
evidently
exerting
himself
to
recall
the
name
which
so
persistently
eluded
his
memory
putting
his
hand
to
his
head
and
showing
the
utmost
confusion
i
can
not
give
you
one
he
finally
stammered
there
is
a
man
who
could
tell
if
only
i
could
remember
his
name
suddenly
with
a
loud
cry
which
escaped
him
involuntarily
he
gave
a
gurgling
laugh
and
we
heard
the
name
tallman
leap
from
his
lips
the
witness
had
at
last
remembered
whom
he
had
met
at
the
cemetery
gate
at
the
hour
or
near
the
hour
his
wife
lay
dying
in
the
lower
part
of
the
city
the
effect
was
electrical
one
of
the
spectators
some
country
boor
no
doubt
so
far
forgot
himself
as
to
cry
out
loud
enough
for
all
to
hear
tallman
let
us
have
tallman
of
course
he
met
with
an
instant
rebuke
but
i
did
not
wait
to
hear
it
or
to
see
order
restored
for
a
glance
from
the
coroner
had
already
sent
me
to
the
door
in
search
of
this
new
witness
my
destination
was
the
cosmos
club
for
phil
tallman
and
his
habits
and
haunts
were
as
well
known
in
washington
as
the
figure
of
liberty
on
the
summit
of
the
capitol
dome
when
i
saw
him
i
did
not
wonder
never
have
i
seen
a
more
amiable
looking
man
or
one
with
a
more
absentminded
expression
to
my
query
as
to
whether
he
had
ever
met
jeffrey
at
or
near
the
entrance
of
rock
creek
cemetery
he
replied
with
an
amazed
look
and
the
quick
response
of
course
i
did
it
was
the
very
night
that
his
wife
but
up
you
look
excited
for
a
detective
come
to
the
morgue
and
see
this
testimony
of
yours
will
prove
invaluable
to
mr
jeffrey
i
shall
never
forget
the
murmur
of
suppressed
excitement
which
greeted
us
as
i
reappeared
before
coroner
and
jury
accompanied
by
the
gentleman
who
had
been
called
for
in
such
peremptory
tones
a
short
time
before
jeffrey
who
had
attempted
to
rise
at
our
entrance
but
seemed
to
lack
the
ability
gave
a
faint
smile
as
tallman
face
appeared
and
the
coroner
feeling
perhaps
that
some
cords
are
liable
to
break
if
stretched
too
strongly
administered
the
oath
and
made
the
necessary
inquiries
with
as
little
delay
as
was
compatible
with
the
solemnity
of
the
occasion
the
result
was
an
absolute
proof
that
jeffrey
had
been
near
soldiers
home
as
late
as
seven
which
was
barely
fifteen
minutes
previous
to
the
hour
jeffrey
watch
was
stopped
by
her
fall
in
the
old
house
on
waverley
avenue
as
the
distance
between
the
two
places
could
not
be
compassed
in
that
time
jeffrey
alibi
could
be
regarded
as
established
when
we
were
all
rising
glad
of
an
adjournment
which
restored
free
movement
and
an
open
interchange
of
speech
a
sudden
check
in
the
general
rush
called
our
attention
back
to
jeffrey
he
was
standing
facing
miss
tuttle
who
was
still
sitting
in
a
strangely
immovable
attitude
in
her
old
place
he
had
just
touched
her
on
the
arm
and
now
with
a
look
of
alarm
he
threw
up
the
veil
which
had
kept
her
face
hidden
from
all
beholders
a
vision
of
loveliness
greeted
us
but
that
was
not
all
it
was
an
unconscious
loveliness
miss
tuttle
had
fainted
away
sitting
upright
in
her
chair
xv
white
bow
and
pink
jeffrey
examination
and
its
triumphant
conclusion
created
a
great
furor
in
town
topics
which
had
hitherto
absorbed
all
minds
were
forgotten
in
the
discussion
of
the
daring
attempt
which
had
been
made
by
the
police
to
fix
crime
upon
one
of
washington
most
esteemed
citizens
and
the
check
which
they
had
rightly
suffered
for
this
outrage
what
might
be
expected
next
something
equally
bold
and
reprehensible
of
course
but
what
it
was
a
question
which
at
the
next
sitting
completely
filled
the
inquest
room
to
my
great
surprise
jeffrey
was
recalled
to
the
stand
he
had
changed
since
the
night
before
he
looked
older
and
while
still
handsome
for
nothing
could
rob
him
of
his
regularity
of
feature
and
extreme
elegance
of
proportion
showed
little
of
the
spirit
which
in
spite
of
the
previous
day
depression
had
upheld
him
through
its
most
trying
ordeal
and
kept
his
eye
bright
if
only
from
excitement
this
was
fact
number
one
and
one
which
i
stored
away
in
my
already
memory
miss
tuttle
sat
in
a
less
conspicuous
position
than
on
the
previous
day
and
moore
her
uncle
was
not
thereat
all
the
testimony
called
for
revived
an
old
point
which
seemingly
had
not
been
settled
to
the
coroner
satisfaction
had
jeffrey
placed
the
small
stand
holding
the
candelabrum
on
the
spot
where
it
had
been
found
no
had
he
carried
into
the
house
at
the
time
of
his
acknowledged
visit
the
candles
which
had
been
afterward
discovered
there
no
he
had
had
time
to
think
since
his
hesitating
and
unsatisfactory
replies
of
the
day
before
and
he
was
now
in
a
position
to
say
that
while
he
distinctly
remembered
buying
candles
on
his
way
to
the
moore
house
he
had
not
found
them
in
his
pocket
on
getting
there
and
had
been
obliged
to
make
use
of
the
matches
he
always
carried
on
his
person
in
order
to
find
his
way
to
the
upstairs
room
where
he
felt
positive
he
would
find
a
candle
this
gave
the
coroner
an
opportunity
to
ask
and
why
did
you
expect
to
find
a
candle
there
the
answer
astonished
me
and
i
have
no
doubt
many
others
it
was
the
room
in
which
my
wife
had
dressed
for
the
ceremony
it
had
not
been
disturbed
since
that
time
my
wife
had
little
ways
of
her
own
one
was
to
complete
her
toilet
by
using
a
curling
iron
on
a
little
lock
she
wore
over
her
temple
when
at
home
she
heated
this
curling
iron
in
the
gas
jet
but
there
being
no
gas
in
the
moore
house
i
naturally
concluded
that
she
had
made
use
of
a
candle
as
the
curl
had
been
noticeable
under
her
veil
oh
the
weariness
in
his
tone
i
could
scarcely
interpret
it
was
he
talking
by
rote
or
was
he
utterly
done
with
life
and
all
its
interests
no
one
besides
myself
seemed
to
note
this
strange
passivity
to
the
masses
he
was
no
longer
a
suffering
man
but
an
individual
from
whom
information
was
to
be
got
the
next
question
was
a
vital
one
he
had
accounted
for
one
candle
in
the
house
could
he
account
for
the
one
found
in
the
tumbler
or
for
the
one
lying
crushed
and
battered
on
the
closet
floor
he
could
not
and
now
we
all
observed
a
change
of
direction
in
the
inquiry
witnesses
were
summoned
to
corroborate
jeffrey
statements
statements
which
it
seemed
to
be
the
coroner
present
wish
to
establish
first
came
the
grocer
who
had
sold
jeffrey
the
candles
he
acknowledged
much
to
jinny
discomfort
that
an
hour
after
jeffrey
had
left
the
store
he
had
found
on
the
counter
the
package
which
that
gentleman
had
forgotten
to
take
poor
jinny
had
not
stayed
long
enough
to
hear
his
story
out
the
grocer
finished
his
testimony
by
saying
that
immediately
upon
his
discovery
he
had
sent
the
candles
to
jeffrey
house
this
the
coroner
caused
to
be
emphasized
to
such
an
extent
that
we
were
all
convinced
of
its
importance
but
as
yet
his
purpose
was
not
evident
save
to
those
who
were
more
in
his
confidence
than
myself
the
other
witnesses
were
men
from
rauchers
who
had
acted
as
waiters
at
the
time
of
the
marriage
one
of
them
testified
that
immediately
on
miss
moore
arrival
he
had
been
sent
for
a
candle
and
a
box
of
matches
the
other
that
he
had
carried
up
to
her
room
a
large
candelabrum
from
the
mantel
a
pair
of
curling
tongs
taken
from
the
dressing
table
of
this
room
was
next
produced
together
with
other
articles
of
toilet
use
which
had
been
allowed
to
remain
there
uncared
for
though
they
were
of
solid
silver
and
of
beautiful
design
the
next
witness
was
a
member
of
jeffrey
own
household
chloe
was
her
name
and
her
good
black
face
worked
dolefully
as
she
admitted
that
the
package
of
candles
which
the
grocer
boy
had
left
on
the
kitchen
table
with
the
rest
of
the
groceries
on
the
morning
of
that
dreadful
day
when
missus
killed
herself
was
not
to
be
found
when
she
came
to
put
the
things
away
she
had
looked
and
looked
for
it
but
it
was
not
there
further
inquiry
brought
out
the
fact
that
but
one
other
member
of
the
household
was
in
the
kitchen
when
these
groceries
were
delivered
and
that
this
person
gave
a
great
start
when
the
boy
shouted
out
the
candles
there
were
bought
by
jeffrey
and
hurried
over
to
the
table
and
handled
the
packages
although
chloe
did
not
see
her
carry
any
of
them
away
and
who
was
this
person
miss
tuttle
with
the
utterance
of
this
name
the
veil
fell
from
the
intentions
and
the
purpose
of
this
petty
but
prolonged
inquiry
stood
revealed
it
was
to
all
a
fearful
and
impressive
moment
to
me
it
was
as
painful
as
it
was
triumphant
i
had
not
anticipated
such
an
outcome
when
i
put
my
wits
to
work
to
prove
that
murder
and
not
suicide
was
answerable
for
young
jeffrey
death
when
the
murmur
which
had
hailed
this
startling
turn
in
the
inquiry
had
subsided
the
coroner
drew
a
deep
breath
and
with
an
uneasy
glance
at
the
jury
who
to
a
man
seemed
to
wish
themselves
well
out
of
this
job
he
dismissed
the
cook
and
summoned
a
fresh
witness
her
name
made
the
people
stare
miss
nixon
miss
nixon
that
was
a
name
well
known
in
washington
almost
as
well
known
as
that
of
uncle
david
or
even
of
tallman
what
could
this
quaint
and
characteristic
little
body
have
to
do
with
this
case
of
doubtful
suicide
a
word
will
explain
she
was
the
person
who
on
the
day
before
had
made
that
loud
exclamation
when
the
box
containing
the
ribbon
and
the
pistol
had
been
disclosed
to
the
jury
as
her
fussy
little
figure
came
forward
some
nudged
and
some
laughed
possibly
because
her
bonnet
was
not
of
this
year
style
possibly
because
her
manner
was
peculiar
and
as
full
of
oddities
as
her
attire
but
they
did
not
laugh
long
for
the
little
look
was
appealing
if
not
distressed
the
fact
that
she
was
generally
known
to
possess
one
of
the
largest
bank
accounts
in
the
district
made
any
marked
show
of
disrespect
toward
her
a
matter
of
poor
judgment
if
not
of
questionable
taste
the
box
in
the
coroner
hand
prepared
us
for
what
was
before
us
as
he
opened
it
and
disclosed
again
the
dainty
white
bow
which
as
i
have
before
said
was
of
rather
a
fantastic
make
the
whole
roomful
of
eager
spectators
craned
forward
and
were
startled
enough
when
he
asked
did
you
ever
see
a
bow
like
this
before
her
answer
came
in
the
faintest
of
tones
yes
i
have
one
like
it
very
like
it
so
like
it
that
yesterday
i
could
not
suppress
an
exclamation
on
seeing
this
one
where
did
you
get
the
one
you
have
who
fashioned
it
i
mean
or
tied
it
for
you
if
that
is
what
i
ought
to
say
it
was
tied
for
me
by
miss
tuttle
she
is
a
friend
of
mine
or
was
and
a
very
good
one
and
one
day
while
watching
me
struggling
with
a
piece
of
ribbon
which
i
wanted
made
into
a
bow
she
took
it
from
my
hand
and
tied
a
knot
for
which
i
was
very
much
obliged
to
her
it
was
very
pretty
and
like
this
almost
exactly
sir
have
you
that
knot
with
you
she
had
will
you
show
it
to
the
jury
heaving
a
sigh
which
she
had
much
better
have
suppressed
she
opened
a
little
bag
she
carried
at
her
side
and
took
out
a
pink
satin
bow
it
had
been
tied
by
a
deft
hand
and
more
than
one
pair
of
eyes
fell
significantly
at
sight
of
it
amid
a
silence
which
was
intense
two
or
three
other
witnesses
were
called
to
prove
that
miss
tuttle
skill
in
was
exceptional
and
was
often
made
use
of
not
only
by
members
of
her
household
but
as
in
miss
nixon
case
by
outsiders
the
special
style
shown
in
the
one
under
consideration
being
the
favorite
during
all
this
i
kept
my
eyes
on
jeffrey
it
had
now
become
so
evident
which
way
the
coroner
inquiries
tended
that
i
wished
to
be
the
first
to
note
their
effect
on
him
it
was
less
marked
than
i
had
anticipated
the
man
seemed
benumbed
by
accumulated
torment
and
stared
at
the
witnesses
filing
before
him
as
if
they
were
part
of
some
wild
phantasmagoria
which
confused
without
enlightening
him
when
finally
several
persons
of
both
sexes
were
brought
forward
to
prove
that
his
attentions
to
miss
tuttle
had
once
been
sufficiently
marked
for
an
announcement
of
their
engagement
to
be
daily
looked
for
he
let
his
head
fall
forward
on
his
breast
as
if
the
creeping
horror
which
had
seized
him
was
too
much
for
his
brain
if
not
for
his
heart
the
final
blow
was
struck
when
the
man
whom
i
had
myself
seen
in
alexandria
testified
to
the
contretemps
which
had
occurred
in
atlantic
city
an
additional
point
being
given
to
it
by
the
repetition
of
some
old
conversation
raked
up
for
the
purpose
by
which
an
effort
was
made
to
prove
that
miss
tuttle
found
it
hard
to
forgive
injuries
even
from
those
nearest
and
dearest
to
her
this
subject
might
have
been
prolonged
but
some
of
the
jury
objected
and
the
time
being
now
ripe
for
the
great
event
of
the
day
the
name
of
the
lady
herself
was
called
after
so
significant
a
preamble
the
mere
utterance
of
miss
name
had
almost
the
force
of
an
accusation
but
the
dignity
with
which
she
rose
calmed
all
minds
and
subdued
every
expression
of
feeling
i
could
but
marvel
at
her
and
noble
equanimity
and
asked
myself
if
in
the
few
days
which
had
passed
since
first
the
murmur
of
something
more
serious
than
suicide
had
gone
about
she
had
so
schooled
herself
for
all
emergencies
that
nothing
could
shake
her
not
even
the
suggestion
that
a
woman
of
her
beauty
and
distinction
could
be
concerned
in
a
crime
or
had
she
within
herself
some
great
source
of
strength
which
sustained
her
in
this
most
dreadful
ordeal
all
were
on
watch
to
see
when
the
veil
dropped
from
before
her
features
and
she
stepped
into
the
full
sight
of
the
expectant
crowd
it
was
not
the
beauty
of
her
face
notable
and
conspicuous
as
that
was
which
roused
the
hum
of
surprise
that
swept
from
one
end
of
the
room
to
the
other
but
the
calmness
almost
the
elevation
of
her
manner
a
calmness
and
elevation
so
unlooked
for
in
the
light
of
the
strange
contradictions
offered
by
the
evidence
to
which
we
had
been
listening
for
a
day
and
a
half
that
all
were
affected
many
inclined
even
to
believe
her
innocent
of
any
undue
connection
with
her
sister
death
before
she
had
stretched
forth
her
hand
to
take
the
oath
i
was
no
exception
to
the
rest
though
i
had
exerted
myself
from
the
first
to
bring
matters
to
a
climax
but
not
to
this
one
i
experienced
such
a
shock
under
the
steady
gaze
of
her
sad
but
gentle
eyes
that
i
found
myself
recoiling
before
my
own
presumption
with
something
like
secret
shame
till
i
was
relieved
by
the
thought
that
a
perfectly
innocent
woman
would
show
more
feeling
at
so
false
and
cruel
a
position
i
felt
that
only
one
with
something
to
conceal
would
turn
so
calm
a
front
upon
men
ready
as
she
knew
to
fix
upon
her
a
great
crime
this
conviction
steadied
me
and
made
me
less
susceptible
to
her
grace
and
to
the
tone
of
her
quiet
voice
and
the
sadness
of
her
look
she
faltered
only
when
by
chance
she
glanced
at
the
shrinking
figure
of
francis
jeffrey
her
name
which
she
uttered
without
emphasis
and
yet
in
a
way
to
arouse
attention
sank
into
all
hearts
with
more
or
less
disturbance
alice
cora
tuttle
how
in
days
gone
by
and
not
so
long
gone
by
either
those
three
words
had
aroused
the
enthusiasm
of
many
a
gallant
man
and
inspired
the
toast
at
many
a
gallant
feast
they
had
their
charm
yet
if
the
heightened
color
observable
on
many
a
cheek
there
was
a
true
index
to
the
quickening
heart
below
how
are
you
connected
with
the
deceased
mrs
jeffrey
i
am
the
child
of
her
mother
by
a
former
husband
we
were
no
bitterness
in
this
statement
only
an
infinite
sadness
the
coroner
continued
to
question
her
he
asked
for
an
account
of
her
childhood
and
forced
her
to
lay
bare
the
nature
of
her
relations
with
her
sister
but
little
was
gained
by
this
for
their
relations
seemed
to
have
been
of
a
sympathetic
character
up
to
the
time
of
veronica
return
from
school
when
they
changed
somewhat
but
how
or
why
miss
tuttle
was
naturally
averse
to
saying
indeed
she
almost
refused
to
do
so
and
the
coroner
feeling
his
point
gained
more
by
this
refusal
than
by
any
admission
she
might
have
made
did
not
press
this
subject
but
passed
on
to
what
interested
us
more
the
various
unexplained
actions
on
her
part
which
pointed
toward
crime
his
first
inquiry
was
in
reference
to
the
conversation
held
between
her
and
jeffrey
at
the
time
he
visited
her
room
we
had
listened
to
his
account
of
it
and
now
we
wished
to
hear
hers
but
the
cue
which
had
been
given
her
by
this
very
account
had
been
invaluable
to
her
and
her
testimony
naturally
coincided
with
his
we
found
ourselves
not
an
inch
advanced
they
had
talked
of
her
sister
follies
and
she
had
advised
patience
and
that
was
all
she
could
say
on
the
subject
all
she
would
say
as
we
presently
saw
the
coroner
introduced
a
fresh
topic
what
can
you
tell
us
about
the
interview
you
had
with
you
sister
prior
to
her
going
out
on
the
night
of
her
death
very
little
except
that
it
differed
entirely
from
what
is
generally
supposed
she
did
not
come
to
my
room
for
conversation
but
simply
to
tell
me
that
she
had
an
engagement
she
was
in
an
excited
mood
but
said
nothing
to
alarm
me
she
even
laughed
when
she
left
me
perhaps
to
put
me
off
my
guard
perhaps
because
she
was
no
longer
responsible
did
she
know
that
jeffrey
had
visited
you
earlier
in
the
day
did
she
make
any
allusion
to
it
i
mean
none
at
all
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
when
i
asked
if
she
was
well
and
anticipated
all
further
questions
by
running
from
the
room
she
was
always
capricious
in
her
ways
and
never
more
so
than
at
that
moment
would
to
god
that
it
had
been
different
would
to
god
that
she
had
shown
herself
to
be
a
suffering
woman
then
i
might
have
reached
her
heart
and
this
tragedy
would
have
been
averted
the
coroner
favored
the
witness
with
a
look
of
respect
perhaps
because
his
next
question
must
necessarily
be
cruel
is
that
all
you
have
to
say
concerning
this
important
visit
the
last
you
held
with
your
sister
before
her
death
no
sir
there
is
something
else
something
which
i
should
like
to
relate
to
this
jury
when
she
came
into
my
room
she
held
in
her
hand
a
white
ribbon
that
is
she
held
the
two
ends
of
a
long
satin
ribbon
which
seemed
to
come
from
her
pocket
handing
those
two
ends
to
me
she
asked
me
to
tie
them
about
her
wrist
knot
under
and
a
bow
on
top
she
said
that
it
can
not
slip
off
as
this
was
something
i
had
often
been
called
on
to
do
for
her
i
showed
no
hesitation
in
complying
with
her
request
indeed
i
felt
none
i
thought
it
was
her
fan
or
her
bouquet
she
held
concealed
in
the
folds
of
her
dress
but
it
proved
to
be
gentlemen
you
know
what
i
pray
that
you
will
not
oblige
me
to
mention
it
it
was
such
a
stroke
as
no
lawyer
would
have
advised
her
to
make
i
heard
afterward
that
she
had
refused
the
offices
of
a
dozen
lawyers
who
had
proffered
her
their
services
but
uttered
as
it
was
with
a
noble
air
and
a
certain
dignified
serenity
it
had
a
great
effect
upon
those
about
her
and
turned
in
a
moment
the
wavering
tide
of
favor
in
her
direction
the
coroner
who
doubtless
was
perfectly
acquainted
with
the
explanation
with
which
she
had
provided
herself
but
who
perhaps
did
not
look
for
it
to
antedate
his
attack
bowed
in
quiet
acknowledgment
of
her
request
and
then
immediately
proceeded
to
ignore
it
i
should
be
glad
to
spare
you
said
he
but
i
do
not
find
it
possible
you
knew
that
jeffrey
had
a
pistol
i
did
that
it
was
kept
in
their
apartment
yes
in
the
upper
drawer
of
a
certain
bureau
yes
now
miss
tuttle
will
you
tell
us
why
you
went
to
that
drawer
if
you
did
go
to
that
drawer
immediately
after
jeffrey
left
the
house
she
had
probably
felt
this
question
coming
not
only
since
the
coroner
began
to
speak
but
ever
since
the
evidence
elicited
from
loretta
proved
that
her
visit
to
this
drawer
had
been
secretly
observed
yet
she
had
no
answer
ready
i
did
not
go
for
the
pistol
she
finally
declared
but
she
did
not
say
what
she
had
gone
for
and
the
coroner
did
not
press
her
again
the
tide
swung
back
she
seemed
to
feel
the
change
but
did
not
show
it
in
the
way
naturally
looked
for
instead
of
growing
perturbed
or
openly
depressed
she
bloomed
into
greater
beauty
and
confronted
with
steadier
eye
not
us
but
the
men
she
instinctively
faced
as
the
tide
of
her
fortunes
began
to
lower
did
the
coroner
perceive
this
and
recognize
at
last
both
the
measure
of
her
attractions
and
the
power
they
were
likely
to
carry
with
them
perhaps
for
his
voice
took
an
acrid
note
as
he
declared
you
had
another
errand
in
that
room
she
let
her
head
droop
just
a
trifle
alas
she
murmured
you
went
to
the
and
took
out
a
book
with
a
peculiar
cover
a
cover
which
jeffrey
has
already
recognized
as
that
of
the
book
in
which
he
found
a
certain
note
you
have
said
it
she
faltered
did
you
take
such
a
book
out
i
did
for
what
purpose
miss
tuttle
she
had
meant
to
answer
quickly
but
some
consideration
made
her
hesitate
and
the
words
were
long
in
coming
when
she
did
speak
it
was
to
say
my
sister
asked
another
favor
of
me
after
i
had
tied
the
ribbon
pausing
in
her
passage
to
the
door
she
informed
me
in
a
tone
quite
in
keeping
with
her
whole
manner
that
she
had
left
a
note
for
her
husband
in
the
book
they
were
reading
together
her
reason
for
doing
this
she
said
was
the
very
natural
one
of
wishing
him
to
come
upon
it
by
chance
but
as
she
had
placed
it
in
the
front
of
the
book
instead
of
in
the
back
where
they
were
reading
she
was
afraid
that
he
would
fail
to
find
it
would
i
be
so
good
as
to
take
it
out
for
her
and
insert
it
again
somewhere
near
the
end
she
was
in
a
hurry
or
she
would
return
and
do
it
herself
as
she
and
jeffrey
had
parted
in
anger
i
hailed
with
joy
this
evidence
of
her
desire
for
a
reconciliation
and
it
was
in
obedience
to
her
request
the
singularity
of
which
did
not
strike
me
as
forcibly
then
as
now
that
i
went
to
the
shelves
in
her
room
and
took
down
the
book
and
did
you
find
the
note
where
she
said
yes
and
put
it
in
toward
the
end
of
the
story
nothing
more
did
you
read
the
note
it
was
folded
was
miss
tuttle
quiet
answer
certainly
this
woman
was
a
thoroughbred
or
else
she
was
an
adept
in
deception
such
as
few
of
us
had
ever
encountered
the
gentleness
of
her
manner
the
easy
tone
the
quiet
eyes
eyes
in
whose
dark
depths
great
passions
were
visible
but
passions
that
were
under
the
control
of
an
equally
forcible
will
made
her
a
puzzle
to
all
men
minds
but
it
was
a
fascinating
puzzle
that
awoke
a
species
of
awe
in
those
who
attempted
to
understand
her
to
all
appearances
she
was
the
unlikeliest
woman
possible
to
cherish
criminal
intents
yet
her
answers
were
rather
clever
than
convincing
unless
you
allowed
yourself
to
be
swayed
by
the
look
of
her
beautiful
face
or
the
music
of
her
rich
sad
voice
you
did
not
remain
before
these
long
observed
the
coroner
you
have
a
witness
who
knows
more
about
that
than
i
do
she
suggested
and
doubtless
aware
of
the
temerity
of
this
reply
waited
with
unmoved
countenance
but
with
a
visibly
bounding
breast
for
what
would
doubtless
prove
a
fresh
attack
it
was
a
violent
one
and
of
a
character
she
was
least
fitted
to
meet
taking
up
the
box
i
have
so
often
mentioned
the
coroner
drew
away
the
ribbon
lying
on
top
and
disclosed
the
pistol
in
a
moment
her
hands
were
over
her
ears
why
do
you
do
that
he
asked
did
you
think
i
was
going
to
discharge
it
she
smiled
pitifully
as
she
let
her
hands
fall
again
i
have
a
dread
of
firearms
she
explained
i
always
have
had
now
they
are
simply
terrible
to
me
and
this
one
i
understand
said
the
coroner
with
a
slight
glance
in
the
direction
of
durbin
they
had
evidently
planned
this
test
together
on
the
strength
of
an
idea
suggested
to
durbin
by
her
former
action
when
the
memory
of
this
shot
was
recalled
to
her
your
horror
seems
to
lie
in
the
direction
of
the
noise
they
make
continued
her
inexorable
interlocutor
one
would
say
you
had
heard
this
pistol
discharged
instantly
a
complete
of
her
hitherto
well
maintained
composure
altered
her
whole
aspect
and
she
vehemently
cried
i
did
i
did
i
was
on
waverley
avenue
that
night
and
i
heard
the
shot
which
in
all
probability
ended
my
sister
life
i
walked
farther
than
i
intended
i
strolled
into
the
street
which
had
such
bitter
memories
for
us
and
i
heard
no
i
was
not
in
search
of
my
sister
i
had
not
associated
my
sister
going
out
with
any
intention
of
visiting
this
house
i
was
merely
troubled
in
mind
and
anxious
and
and
she
had
overrated
her
strength
or
her
cleverness
she
found
herself
unable
to
finish
the
sentence
and
so
did
not
try
she
had
been
led
by
the
impulse
of
the
moment
farther
than
she
had
intended
and
aghast
at
her
own
imprudence
paused
with
her
first
perceptible
loss
of
courage
before
the
yawning
gulf
opening
before
her
i
felt
myself
seized
by
a
very
uncomfortable
dread
lest
her
concealments
and
unfinished
sentences
hid
a
guiltier
knowledge
of
this
crime
than
i
was
yet
ready
to
admit
the
coroner
who
is
an
older
man
than
myself
betrayed
a
certain
satisfaction
but
no
dread
never
did
the
unction
which
underlies
his
sharpest
speeches
show
more
plainly
than
when
he
quietly
remarked
and
so
under
a
similar
impulse
you
as
well
as
jeffrey
chose
this
uncanny
place
to
ramble
in
to
all
appearance
that
old
hearth
acted
much
more
like
a
lodestone
upon
members
of
your
family
than
you
were
willing
at
one
time
to
acknowledge
this
reference
to
words
she
had
herself
been
heard
to
use
seemed
to
overwhelm
her
her
calmness
fled
and
she
cast
a
fleeting
look
of
anguish
at
jeffrey
but
his
face
was
turned
from
sight
and
meeting
with
no
help
there
or
anywhere
indeed
save
in
her
own
powerful
nature
she
recovered
as
best
she
could
the
ground
she
had
lost
and
with
a
trembling
question
of
her
own
attempted
to
put
the
coroner
in
fault
and
reestablish
herself
you
say
through
do
you
for
a
moment
think
that
i
entered
that
old
house
miss
tuttle
was
the
grave
almost
sad
reply
did
you
not
know
that
in
some
earth
dropped
from
a
overturned
at
the
time
when
a
hundred
guests
flew
in
terror
from
this
house
there
is
to
be
seen
the
mark
of
a
footstep
a
footstep
which
you
are
at
liberty
to
measure
with
your
own
ah
she
murmured
her
hands
going
up
to
her
face
but
in
another
moment
she
had
dropped
them
and
looked
directly
at
the
coroner
i
walked
there
i
never
said
that
i
did
not
walk
there
when
i
went
later
to
see
my
sister
and
in
sight
of
a
number
of
detectives
passed
straight
through
the
halls
and
into
the
library
and
that
this
footstep
inexorably
proceeded
the
coroner
is
not
in
a
line
with
the
main
thoroughfare
extending
from
the
front
to
the
back
of
the
house
but
turned
inwards
toward
the
wall
as
if
she
who
made
it
had
stopped
to
lean
her
head
against
the
partition
miss
tuttle
head
drooped
probably
she
realized
at
this
moment
if
not
before
that
the
coroner
and
jury
had
ample
excuse
for
mistrusting
one
who
had
been
so
unmistakably
caught
in
a
prevarication
possibly
her
regret
carried
her
far
enough
to
wish
she
had
not
disdained
all
legal
advice
from
those
who
had
so
earnestly
offered
it
but
though
she
showed
alike
her
shame
and
her
disheartenment
she
did
not
give
up
the
struggle
if
i
went
into
the
house
she
said
it
was
not
to
enter
that
room
i
had
too
great
a
dread
of
it
if
i
rested
my
head
against
the
wall
it
was
in
terror
of
that
shot
it
came
so
suddenly
and
was
so
frightful
so
much
more
frightful
than
anything
you
can
conceive
then
you
did
enter
the
house
i
did
and
it
was
while
you
were
inside
instead
of
outside
that
you
heard
the
shot
i
must
admit
that
too
i
was
at
the
library
door
you
acknowledge
that
i
do
but
you
did
not
enter
the
library
no
not
then
not
till
i
was
taken
back
by
the
officer
who
told
me
of
my
sister
death
we
are
glad
to
hear
this
precise
statement
from
you
it
encourages
me
to
ask
again
the
nature
of
the
freak
which
took
you
into
this
house
you
say
that
it
was
not
from
any
dread
on
your
account
what
then
was
it
no
evasive
answer
will
satisfy
us
miss
tuttle
she
realized
this
as
no
one
else
could
jeffrey
reason
for
his
visit
there
could
not
be
her
reason
yet
what
other
had
she
to
give
apparently
none
i
can
not
answer
she
said
and
the
deep
sigh
which
swept
through
the
room
was
but
an
echo
of
the
despair
with
which
she
saw
herself
brought
to
this
point
we
will
not
oblige
you
to
said
the
coroner
with
apparent
consideration
but
to
those
who
knew
the
law
against
forcing
a
witness
to
incriminate
himself
this
was
far
from
an
encouraging
concession
however
he
now
went
on
with
suddenly
assumed
severity
you
may
answer
this
was
the
house
dark
or
light
when
you
entered
it
and
how
did
you
get
in
the
house
was
dark
and
i
got
in
through
the
front
door
which
i
found
ajar
you
are
more
courageous
than
most
women
i
fear
there
are
few
of
your
sex
who
could
be
induced
to
enter
it
in
broad
daylight
and
under
every
suitable
protection
she
raised
her
figure
proudly
miss
tuttle
you
have
heard
chloe
say
that
you
were
in
the
kitchen
of
jeffrey
house
when
the
grocer
boy
delivered
the
candles
which
had
been
left
by
your
on
the
counter
of
the
store
where
he
bought
them
is
this
true
yes
sir
it
is
true
did
you
see
those
candles
no
sir
you
did
not
see
them
no
sir
yet
you
went
over
to
the
table
yes
sir
but
i
did
not
meddle
with
the
packages
i
had
really
no
business
with
them
the
coroner
surveying
her
sadly
went
quickly
on
as
if
anxious
to
terminate
this
painful
examination
you
have
not
told
us
what
you
did
when
you
heard
that
i
ran
away
as
soon
as
i
could
move
i
ran
madly
from
the
house
where
home
but
it
was
ten
when
you
got
home
was
it
it
was
ten
when
the
man
came
to
tell
you
of
your
sister
death
it
may
have
been
your
sister
is
supposed
to
have
died
in
a
few
minutes
where
were
you
in
the
interim
god
knows
i
do
not
a
wild
look
was
creeping
into
her
face
and
her
figure
was
swaying
but
she
soon
steadied
it
i
have
never
seen
a
more
admirable
presence
maintained
in
the
face
of
a
dreadful
humiliation
perhaps
i
can
help
you
rejoined
the
coroner
not
unkindly
were
you
not
in
the
congressional
library
looking
up
at
the
lunettes
and
gorgeously
painted
walls
i
her
eyes
opened
wide
in
wondering
doubt
if
i
was
i
did
not
know
it
i
have
no
remembrance
of
it
she
seemed
to
lose
sight
of
her
present
position
the
cloud
under
which
she
rested
and
even
the
construction
which
might
be
put
upon
such
a
forgetfulness
at
a
time
confessedly
prior
to
her
knowledge
of
the
purpose
and
effect
of
the
shot
from
which
she
had
so
incontinently
fled
your
condition
of
mind
and
that
of
jeffrey
seem
to
have
been
strangely
alike
remarked
the
coroner
no
no
she
protested
arguing
a
like
source
no
no
she
cried
again
this
time
with
positive
agony
then
with
an
effort
which
awakened
respect
for
her
powers
of
mind
if
for
nothing
else
she
desperately
added
i
can
not
say
what
was
in
his
heart
that
night
but
i
know
what
was
in
mine
dread
of
that
old
house
to
which
i
had
been
drawn
in
spite
of
myself
possibly
by
the
force
of
the
tragedy
going
on
inside
it
culminating
in
a
delirium
of
terror
which
sent
me
flying
in
an
opposite
direction
from
my
home
and
into
places
i
had
been
accustomed
to
visit
when
my
heart
was
light
and
untroubled
the
coroner
glanced
at
the
jury
who
unconsciously
shook
their
heads
he
shook
his
too
as
he
returned
to
the
charge
another
question
miss
tuttle
when
you
heard
a
sounding
from
the
depths
of
that
dark
library
what
did
you
think
it
meant
she
put
her
hands
over
her
ears
it
seemed
as
if
she
could
not
prevent
this
instinctive
expression
of
recoil
at
the
mention
of
the
weapon
and
in
very
low
tones
replied
something
dreadful
something
superstitious
it
was
night
you
remember
and
at
night
one
has
such
horrible
thoughts
yet
an
hour
or
two
later
you
declared
that
the
hearth
was
no
lodestone
you
forgot
its
horrors
and
your
superstition
upon
returning
to
your
own
house
it
might
be
she
murmured
but
if
so
they
soon
returned
i
had
reason
for
my
horror
if
not
for
my
superstition
as
the
event
showed
the
coroner
did
not
attempt
to
controvert
this
he
was
about
to
launch
a
final
inquiry
miss
tuttle
upon
the
return
of
yourself
and
jeffrey
to
your
home
after
your
final
visit
to
the
moore
house
did
you
have
any
interview
that
was
without
witnesses
no
did
you
exchange
any
words
i
think
we
did
exchange
some
words
it
would
be
only
natural
are
you
willing
to
state
what
words
she
looked
dazed
and
appeared
to
search
her
memory
i
do
think
i
can
she
objected
but
something
was
said
by
you
and
some
answer
was
made
by
him
i
believe
so
can
not
you
say
definitely
we
did
speak
in
english
no
in
french
can
not
you
translate
that
french
for
us
pardon
me
sir
it
was
so
long
ago
my
memory
fails
me
is
it
any
better
for
the
second
and
longer
interview
between
you
the
next
day
you
can
not
give
us
any
phrase
or
word
that
was
uttered
there
no
is
this
your
final
reply
on
this
subject
it
is
she
never
had
been
subjected
to
an
interrogation
like
this
before
it
made
her
proud
soul
quiver
in
revolt
notwithstanding
the
patience
with
which
she
had
fortified
herself
with
red
cheeks
and
glistening
eyes
she
surveyed
the
man
who
had
made
her
suffer
so
and
instantly
every
other
man
there
suffered
with
her
excepting
possibly
durbin
whose
heart
was
never
his
strong
point
but
our
hearts
were
moved
our
reasons
were
not
convinced
as
was
presently
shown
when
with
a
bow
of
dismissal
the
coroner
released
her
and
she
passed
back
to
her
seat
simultaneously
with
her
withdrawal
the
gleam
of
sensibility
left
the
faces
of
the
jury
and
the
dark
and
brooding
look
which
had
marked
their
countenances
from
the
beginning
returned
and
returned
to
stay
what
would
their
verdict
be
there
were
present
two
persons
who
affected
to
believe
that
it
would
be
one
of
suicide
occasioned
by
dementia
these
were
miss
tuttle
and
jeffrey
who
now
that
the
critical
period
had
come
straightened
themselves
boldly
in
their
seats
and
met
the
glances
concentrated
upon
them
with
dignity
if
not
with
the
assurance
of
complete
innocence
but
from
the
carefulness
with
which
they
avoided
each
other
eyes
and
the
almost
identical
expression
mirrored
upon
both
faces
it
was
visible
to
all
that
they
regarded
their
cause
as
a
common
one
and
that
the
link
which
they
denied
as
having
existed
between
them
prior
to
jeffrey
death
had
in
some
way
been
supplied
by
that
very
tragedy
so
that
they
now
unwittingly
looked
with
the
same
eyes
breathed
with
the
same
breath
and
showed
themselves
responsive
to
the
same
fluctuations
of
hope
and
fear
the
celerity
with
which
that
jury
arrived
at
its
verdict
was
a
shock
to
us
all
it
had
been
a
quiet
body
offering
but
little
assistance
to
the
coroner
in
his
questioning
but
when
it
fell
to
these
men
to
act
the
precision
with
which
they
did
so
was
astonishing
in
a
they
returned
from
the
room
into
which
they
had
adjourned
and
the
foreman
gave
warning
that
he
was
prepared
to
render
a
verdict
jeffrey
and
miss
tuttle
both
clenched
their
hands
then
miss
tuttle
pulled
down
her
veil
we
find
said
the
solemn
foreman
that
veronica
moore
jeffrey
who
on
the
night
of
may
eleventh
was
discovered
lying
dead
on
the
floor
of
her
own
unoccupied
house
in
waverley
avenue
came
to
her
death
by
means
of
a
bullet
shot
from
a
pistol
connected
to
her
wrist
by
a
length
of
white
satin
ribbon
that
the
first
conclusion
of
suicide
is
not
fully
sustained
by
the
facts
and
that
attempt
should
be
made
to
identify
the
hand
that
fired
this
pistol
it
was
as
near
an
accusation
of
miss
tuttle
as
was
possible
without
mentioning
her
name
a
groan
passed
through
the
assemblage
and
jeffrey
bounding
to
his
feet
showed
an
inclination
to
shout
aloud
in
his
violent
indignation
but
miss
tuttle
turning
toward
him
lifted
her
hand
with
a
commanding
gesture
and
held
it
so
till
he
sat
down
again
it
was
both
a
majestic
and
an
utterly
incomprehensible
movement
on
her
part
giving
to
the
close
of
these
remarkable
proceedings
a
dramatic
climax
which
set
all
hearts
beating
and
i
am
bound
to
say
all
tongues
wagging
till
the
room
cleared
xvi
an
egotist
of
the
first
water
had
the
control
of
affairs
been
mine
at
this
moment
i
am
quite
positive
that
i
should
have
found
it
difficult
to
deny
these
two
the
short
interview
which
they
appeared
to
crave
and
which
would
have
been
to
them
such
an
undeniable
comfort
but
a
sterner
spirit
than
mine
was
in
charge
and
the
district
attorney
into
whose
hands
the
affair
had
now
fallen
was
inexorable
miss
tuttle
was
treated
with
respect
with
kindness
even
but
she
was
not
allowed
any
communication
with
her
beyond
the
formal
good
afternoon
incident
upon
their
separation
while
he
scorning
to
condemn
his
lips
to
any
such
trite
commonplace
said
nothing
at
all
only
looked
a
haggard
inquiry
which
called
forth
from
her
the
most
exalted
look
of
patience
and
encouraging
love
it
has
ever
been
my
good
fortune
to
witness
durbin
was
standing
near
and
saw
this
look
as
plainly
as
i
did
but
it
did
not
impose
on
him
he
said
but
what
in
the
nature
of
human
woe
could
impose
on
him
durbin
is
a
machine
a
very
reliable
and
useful
machine
no
doubt
yet
when
all
is
said
a
simple
contrivance
of
cogs
and
wheels
while
i
well
i
hope
that
i
am
something
more
than
that
or
why
was
i
a
changed
man
toward
her
from
the
moment
i
saw
the
smile
which
marked
this
accused
woman
good
by
to
francis
jeffrey
no
longer
believing
in
her
guilt
i
went
about
my
business
with
tumult
in
brain
and
heart
asking
in
my
remorse
for
an
opportunity
to
show
her
some
small
courtesy
whereby
to
relieve
the
torture
i
felt
at
having
helped
the
coroner
in
the
inquiries
which
had
brought
about
what
looked
to
me
now
like
a
cruel
and
unwarranted
result
that
it
should
be
given
to
durbin
to
hold
such
surveillance
over
her
as
her
doubtful
position
demanded
added
greatly
to
my
discomfort
but
i
was
enabled
to
keep
my
lips
firmly
shut
over
any
expression
of
secret
jealousy
or
displeasure
and
this
was
fortunate
as
otherwise
i
might
have
failed
to
obtain
the
chance
of
aiding
her
later
on
in
other
and
deeper
matters
meanwhile
and
before
any
of
us
had
left
this
room
one
fact
had
become
apparent
jeffrey
was
not
going
to
volunteer
any
fresh
statement
in
face
of
the
distinct
disapproval
of
his
as
his
eye
fell
upon
the
district
attorney
who
had
lingered
near
possibly
in
the
hope
of
getting
something
more
from
this
depressed
and
almost
insensible
man
he
made
one
remark
but
it
was
an
automatic
one
calculated
to
produce
but
little
effect
on
the
discriminating
ears
of
this
experienced
official
i
do
not
believe
that
my
wife
was
murdered
this
was
what
he
said
it
was
a
wicked
verdict
my
wife
killed
herself
was
the
pistol
found
tied
to
her
either
from
preoccupation
or
a
dazed
condition
of
mind
he
seemed
to
forget
that
miss
tuttle
had
owned
to
tying
on
this
pistol
and
that
nothing
but
her
word
went
to
prove
that
this
was
done
before
and
not
after
the
shot
had
been
delivered
in
the
moore
house
library
i
thought
i
understood
him
and
was
certain
that
i
sympathized
with
his
condition
but
in
the
ears
of
those
less
amiably
disposed
toward
him
his
statements
had
lost
force
and
the
denial
went
for
little
meanwhile
a
fact
which
all
had
noted
and
commented
on
had
recurred
to
my
mind
and
caused
me
to
ask
a
brother
officer
who
was
walking
out
beside
me
what
he
thought
of
moore
absence
from
an
inquiry
presumably
of
such
importance
to
all
members
of
this
family
the
fellow
laughed
and
said
old
dave
has
lost
none
of
his
peculiarities
in
walking
into
his
fortune
this
is
his
day
at
the
cemetery
did
you
know
that
he
will
let
nothing
on
earth
get
in
the
way
of
his
pilgrimage
to
that
spot
on
the
of
may
much
less
so
trivial
an
occurrence
as
an
inquest
over
the
remains
of
his
nearest
relative
i
felt
my
gorge
rise
then
a
thought
struck
me
and
i
asked
how
long
the
old
gentleman
kept
up
his
watch
from
sunrise
to
sundown
the
boys
say
i
never
saw
him
there
myself
my
beat
lies
in
an
opposite
direction
i
left
him
and
started
for
rock
creek
cemetery
there
were
two
good
hours
yet
before
sundown
and
i
resolved
to
come
upon
uncle
david
at
his
post
it
took
just
one
hour
and
a
quarter
to
get
there
by
the
most
direct
route
i
could
take
five
minutes
more
to
penetrate
the
grounds
to
where
a
superb
vehicle
stood
drawn
by
two
of
the
finest
horses
i
had
seen
in
washington
for
many
a
long
day
as
i
was
making
my
way
around
this
equipage
i
came
upon
a
plot
in
a
condition
of
upheaval
preparatory
to
new
sodding
and
the
planting
of
several
choice
shrubs
in
the
midst
of
the
sand
thus
exposed
a
single
rose
on
his
knees
beside
this
simple
monument
i
saw
the
figure
of
uncle
david
dressed
in
his
finest
clothes
and
showing
in
his
oddly
contorted
face
the
satisfaction
of
great
prosperity
battling
with
the
dissatisfaction
of
knowing
that
one
he
had
so
loved
had
not
lived
to
share
his
elevation
he
was
rubbing
away
the
mold
from
the
name
which
by
his
own
confession
was
the
only
one
to
which
his
memory
clung
in
sympathy
or
endearment
at
his
feet
lay
an
open
basket
in
which
i
detected
the
remains
of
what
must
have
been
a
rather
sumptuous
cold
repast
to
all
appearance
he
had
foregone
none
of
his
ancient
customs
only
those
customs
had
taken
on
elegance
with
his
rise
in
fortune
the
carriage
and
the
horses
and
most
of
all
the
imperturbable
driver
seemed
to
awaken
some
awe
in
the
boys
they
were
still
in
evidence
but
they
hung
back
sheepishly
and
eyed
the
basket
of
neglected
food
as
if
they
hoped
he
would
forget
to
take
it
away
meanwhile
the
clattering
of
chains
against
the
harness
the
pawing
of
the
horses
and
the
low
exclamations
of
the
driver
caused
me
the
queerest
feelings
advancing
quite
unceremoniously
upon
the
watcher
by
the
grave
i
remarked
aloud
the
setting
sun
will
soon
release
you
moore
are
you
going
immediately
into
town
he
paused
in
his
rubbing
which
was
being
done
with
a
very
tender
hand
and
as
if
he
really
loved
the
name
he
was
endeavoring
to
bring
into
plainer
view
scowling
a
little
he
turned
and
met
me
with
a
look
which
had
a
good
deal
of
inquiry
in
it
i
am
not
usually
interrupted
here
he
emphasized
except
by
the
boys
he
added
more
mildly
they
sometimes
approach
too
closely
but
i
am
used
to
the
imps
and
scarcely
notice
them
ah
there
are
some
of
my
old
friends
now
well
it
is
time
they
knew
that
a
change
has
taken
place
in
my
fortunes
hi
there
hands
up
and
catch
this
and
this
and
this
he
shouted
but
keep
quiet
about
it
or
next
year
you
will
get
pennies
again
and
flinging
quarters
right
and
left
he
smiled
in
such
a
pompous
way
at
the
hurrah
and
scramble
which
ensued
that
it
was
well
worth
my
journey
there
just
to
see
this
exhibition
of
combined
vanity
and
good
humor
now
go
he
vociferated
and
the
urchins
black
and
white
flew
away
flinging
up
their
heels
in
delight
and
shouting
bully
for
you
uncle
david
we
come
again
next
year
not
for
but
fifties
i
will
make
it
dollars
if
i
only
live
so
long
he
muttered
and
deigning
now
to
remember
the
question
i
had
put
to
him
he
grandly
remarked
i
am
going
straight
into
town
can
i
do
anything
for
you
nothing
i
thought
you
might
like
to
know
what
awaits
you
there
the
city
is
greatly
stirred
up
the
coroner
jury
in
the
case
has
just
brought
in
a
verdict
to
the
effect
that
suicide
has
not
been
proved
naturally
this
is
equivalent
to
one
of
murder
ah
he
ejaculated
slightly
taken
aback
for
one
so
invariably
impassive
and
to
whom
is
the
guilt
of
this
crime
ascribed
he
presently
ventured
there
was
mention
of
no
name
but
the
opprobrium
naturally
falls
on
miss
tuttle
miss
tuttle
ah
since
jeffrey
is
proved
to
have
been
too
far
away
at
the
time
to
have
fired
that
shot
while
she
i
am
following
you
was
in
the
very
house
at
the
door
of
the
library
in
fact
and
heard
the
pistol
discharged
if
she
did
not
discharge
it
herself
which
some
believe
notably
the
district
attorney
you
should
have
been
there
mr
moore
he
looked
surprised
at
this
suggestion
i
never
am
anywhere
but
here
on
the
of
may
he
declared
miss
tuttle
needed
some
adviser
ah
probably
you
would
have
been
a
good
one
and
a
welcome
one
eh
i
hardly
thought
he
would
have
been
a
welcome
one
but
i
did
not
admit
the
fact
nevertheless
he
seized
on
the
advantage
he
evidently
thought
he
had
gained
and
added
mildly
enough
or
rather
without
any
display
of
feeling
miss
tuttle
likes
me
even
less
than
veronica
did
i
do
not
think
she
would
have
accepted
certainly
she
would
not
have
desired
my
presence
in
her
counsels
but
of
one
thing
i
wish
her
to
be
assured
her
and
the
world
in
general
any
money
she
may
need
at
this
at
this
unhappy
crisis
in
her
life
she
will
find
amply
supplied
she
has
no
claims
on
me
but
that
makes
little
difference
where
the
family
honor
is
concerned
her
mother
husband
was
my
brother
the
girl
shall
have
all
she
needs
i
will
write
her
so
he
was
moving
toward
his
carriage
fine
turnout
he
interrogatively
remarked
i
assented
with
all
the
surprise
with
all
the
wonder
even
which
his
sublime
egotism
seemed
to
invite
it
is
the
best
that
downey
could
raise
in
the
time
i
allotted
him
when
i
really
finger
the
money
we
shall
see
we
shall
see
his
foot
was
on
the
he
looked
up
at
the
west
the
sun
was
almost
down
but
not
quite
have
you
any
special
business
with
me
he
asked
lingering
with
what
i
thought
a
surprising
display
of
conscientiousness
till
the
last
ray
of
direct
sunlight
had
disappeared
i
glanced
up
at
the
coachman
sitting
on
his
box
as
rigid
as
any
stone
you
may
speak
said
he
caesar
neither
hears
nor
sees
anything
but
his
horses
when
he
drives
me
the
black
did
not
wink
he
was
as
completely
at
home
on
the
box
and
as
quiet
and
composed
in
his
service
as
if
he
had
driven
this
man
for
years
he
understands
his
duty
finished
the
master
but
with
no
outward
appearance
of
pride
what
have
you
to
say
to
me
i
hesitated
no
longer
miss
tuttle
is
supposed
to
have
secretly
entered
the
moore
house
on
the
night
you
summoned
us
she
even
says
she
did
i
know
that
you
have
sworn
to
having
seen
no
one
go
into
that
house
but
notwithstanding
this
have
you
some
means
at
your
disposal
for
proving
to
the
police
and
to
the
world
at
large
that
she
never
fired
that
fatal
shot
public
opinion
is
so
cruel
she
will
be
ruined
whether
innocent
or
guilty
unless
it
can
be
very
plainly
shown
that
she
did
not
enter
the
library
prior
to
going
there
with
the
police
and
how
can
you
suppose
me
to
be
in
a
position
to
prove
that
say
that
i
had
sat
in
my
front
window
all
that
evening
and
watched
with
uninterrupted
assiduity
the
door
through
which
so
many
are
said
to
have
passed
between
sunset
and
midnight
something
which
i
did
not
do
as
i
have
plainly
stated
on
oath
how
could
you
have
expected
me
to
see
what
went
on
in
the
black
interior
of
a
house
whose
exterior
is
barely
discernible
at
night
across
the
street
then
you
can
not
aid
her
i
asked
with
a
light
bound
he
leaped
into
the
carriage
as
he
took
his
seat
he
politely
remarked
i
should
be
glad
to
since
though
not
a
moore
she
is
near
enough
the
family
to
affect
its
honor
but
not
having
even
seen
her
enter
the
house
i
can
not
testify
in
any
way
in
regard
to
her
home
caesar
and
drive
quickly
i
do
not
thrive
under
these
evening
damps
and
leaning
back
with
an
inexpressible
air
of
contentment
with
himself
his
equipage
and
the
prospect
of
an
indefinite
enjoyment
of
the
same
the
last
representative
of
the
great
moore
family
was
quietly
driven
away
xvii
a
fresh
start
i
was
far
from
being
good
company
that
night
i
knew
this
without
being
told
my
mind
was
too
busy
i
was
too
full
of
regrets
and
plans
seasonings
and
counter
reasonings
in
my
eyes
miss
tuttle
had
suddenly
become
innocent
consequently
a
victim
but
a
victim
to
what
to
some
exaggerated
sense
of
duty
possibly
but
to
what
duty
that
was
the
question
to
answer
which
offhand
i
would
in
my
present
excitement
have
been
ready
to
sacrifice
a
month
pay
for
i
was
moved
not
only
by
the
admiration
and
sympathy
which
all
men
must
feel
for
a
beautiful
woman
caught
in
such
a
deadly
snare
of
circumstantial
evidence
but
by
the
conviction
that
durbin
whose
present
sleek
complacency
was
more
offensive
to
me
than
the
sneering
superiority
of
a
week
ago
believed
her
to
be
a
guilty
woman
and
as
such
his
rightful
prey
this
alone
would
have
influenced
me
to
take
the
opposite
view
for
we
never
ran
along
together
and
in
a
case
where
any
division
of
opinion
was
possible
always
found
ourselves
consciously
or
unconsciously
on
different
sides
yet
i
did
not
really
dislike
durbin
who
is
a
very
fine
fellow
i
only
hated
his
success
and
the
favor
which
rewarded
it
i
know
that
i
have
some
very
nasty
failings
and
i
do
not
shrink
from
owning
them
my
desire
is
to
represent
myself
as
i
am
and
i
must
admit
that
it
was
not
entirely
owing
to
disinterested
motives
that
i
now
took
the
secret
stand
i
did
in
miss
tuttle
favor
to
prove
her
innocent
whom
once
i
considered
the
cause
of
if
not
the
guilty
accessory
to
her
sister
murder
now
became
my
dream
by
night
and
my
occupation
by
day
though
i
seemed
to
have
no
sympathizer
in
this
effort
and
though
the
case
against
her
was
being
pushed
very
openly
in
the
district
attorney
office
yet
i
clung
to
my
convictions
with
an
almost
insensate
persistence
inwardly
declaring
her
the
victim
of
circumstances
and
hoping
against
hope
that
some
clue
would
offer
itself
by
means
of
which
i
might
yet
prove
her
so
but
where
was
i
to
seek
for
this
clue
alas
no
ready
answer
to
this
very
important
query
was
forthcoming
all
possible
evidence
in
this
case
seemed
to
have
been
exhausted
save
such
as
jeffrey
and
miss
tuttle
withheld
and
so
the
monstrous
accusation
stood
and
before
it
all
washington
my
humble
self
included
stood
in
a
daze
of
mingled
doubt
and
compassion
hunting
for
explanations
which
failed
to
appear
and
seeking
in
vain
for
some
guiltier
party
who
evermore
slipped
from
under
our
hand
had
jeffrey
alibi
been
less
complete
he
could
not
have
stood
up
against
the
suspicions
which
now
ran
riot
but
there
was
no
possibility
of
shifting
the
actual
crime
back
to
him
after
the
testimony
of
so
frank
and
trustworthy
a
man
as
tallman
if
the
stopping
of
jeffrey
watch
fixed
the
moment
of
her
death
as
accurately
as
was
supposed
and
i
never
heard
the
least
doubt
thrown
out
in
this
regard
he
could
not
by
any
means
of
transit
then
known
in
washington
have
reached
waverley
avenue
in
time
to
fire
that
shot
the
gates
of
the
cemetery
were
closed
at
sundown
sundown
took
place
that
night
at
one
minute
past
seven
and
the
distance
into
town
is
considerable
his
alibi
could
not
be
gainsaid
so
his
name
failed
to
be
publicly
broached
in
connection
with
the
shooting
though
his
influence
over
miss
tuttle
could
not
be
forgotten
suggesting
to
some
that
she
had
acted
as
his
hand
in
the
deed
which
robbed
him
of
an
undesirable
wife
but
this
i
would
not
believe
i
preferred
to
accept
the
statement
that
she
had
stopped
short
of
the
library
door
in
her
suspicious
visit
there
and
that
the
which
went
for
so
much
had
been
done
at
home
that
these
facts
especially
the
latter
called
for
more
than
common
credulity
i
was
quite
ready
to
acknowledge
and
had
her
feeling
for
francis
jeffrey
shown
less
unselfishness
i
should
certainly
have
joined
my
fellows
in
regarding
these
assertions
as
very
lame
attempts
to
explain
what
could
only
be
explained
by
a
confession
of
guilt
so
here
was
a
tangle
without
a
frayed
end
to
pull
at
unless
the
impervious
egotism
of
uncle
david
afforded
one
which
i
doubted
for
how
could
any
man
with
a
frightful
secret
in
his
breast
show
that
unmixed
delight
in
his
new
equipage
and
suddenly
acquired
position
which
had
so
plainly
beamed
from
that
gentleman
calm
eye
and
assured
bearing
when
he
met
my
scrutiny
in
the
sacred
precincts
where
the
one
love
of
his
heart
lay
buried
he
did
so
without
a
quiver
or
any
sign
of
inner
disturbance
his
tone
to
caesar
as
he
drove
off
had
been
the
tone
of
a
man
who
can
afford
to
speak
quietly
because
he
is
conscious
of
being
so
undeniably
the
master
and
when
his
foot
rose
to
the
carriage
step
it
was
with
the
confidence
of
one
who
had
been
kept
out
of
his
rights
for
most
of
his
natural
life
but
who
feels
in
his
present
enjoyment
of
them
no
apprehension
of
a
change
his
whole
bearing
and
conversation
on
that
day
were
as
i
am
quite
ready
to
admit
an
exhibition
of
prodigious
selfishness
but
it
was
also
an
exhibition
of
mental
poise
incompatible
with
a
consciousness
of
having
acquired
his
fortune
by
any
means
which
laid
him
open
to
the
possibility
of
losing
it
or
so
i
judged
finding
myself
with
every
new
consideration
of
the
tantalizing
subject
deeper
and
deeper
in
the
quagmire
of
doubt
and
uncertainty
i
sought
enlightenment
by
making
a
memorandum
of
the
special
points
which
must
have
influenced
the
jury
in
their
verdict
as
witness
the
relief
shown
by
jeffrey
at
finding
an
apparent
communication
from
his
wife
hinting
at
suicide
the
possibility
disclosed
by
the
similarity
between
the
handwriting
of
this
same
communication
being
a
forgery
substituted
for
the
one
really
written
by
jeffrey
the
fact
that
previous
to
jeffrey
handling
of
the
book
in
which
this
communication
was
said
to
have
been
hidden
it
had
been
seen
in
miss
tuttle
hands
that
immediately
after
this
she
had
passed
to
the
drawer
where
jeffrey
pistol
was
kept
that
while
this
pistol
had
not
been
observed
in
her
hand
there
was
as
yet
no
evidence
to
prove
that
it
had
been
previously
taken
from
the
drawer
save
such
as
was
afforded
by
her
own
acknowledgment
that
she
had
tied
some
unknown
object
presumably
the
pistol
to
her
sister
wrist
before
that
sister
left
the
house
that
if
this
was
so
the
pistol
and
the
ribbon
connecting
it
with
jeffrey
wrist
had
been
handled
again
before
the
former
was
discharged
and
by
fingers
which
had
first
touched
dust
of
which
there
was
plenty
in
the
old
library
that
miss
tuttle
had
admitted
though
not
till
after
much
prevarication
and
apparent
subterfuge
that
she
had
extended
her
walk
on
that
fatal
night
not
only
as
far
as
the
moore
house
but
that
she
had
entered
it
and
penetrated
as
far
as
the
library
door
at
the
very
moment
the
shot
was
fired
within
that
in
acknowledging
this
she
had
emphatically
denied
having
associated
the
firing
of
this
shot
with
any
idea
of
harm
to
her
sister
yet
was
known
to
have
gone
from
this
house
in
a
condition
of
mind
so
serious
that
she
failed
to
recollect
the
places
she
visited
or
the
streets
she
passed
through
till
she
found
herself
again
in
her
sister
house
face
to
face
with
an
officer
that
her
first
greeting
of
this
officer
was
a
shriek
betraying
a
knowledge
of
his
errand
before
he
had
given
utterance
to
a
word
that
the
candles
found
in
the
moore
house
were
similar
to
those
bought
by
jeffrey
and
afterward
delivered
at
his
kitchen
door
that
she
was
the
only
member
of
the
household
besides
the
cook
who
was
in
the
kitchen
at
the
time
and
that
it
was
immediately
after
her
departure
from
the
room
that
the
package
containing
the
candles
had
been
missed
that
opportunities
of
coming
to
an
understanding
with
jeffrey
after
his
wife
death
had
not
been
lacking
and
it
was
not
until
after
such
opportunities
had
occurred
that
any
serious
inquiry
into
this
matter
had
been
begun
by
the
police
to
which
must
be
added
not
in
way
of
proof
but
as
an
important
factor
in
the
case
that
her
manner
never
open
was
such
throughout
her
whole
public
examination
as
to
make
it
evident
to
all
that
only
half
of
what
had
occurred
in
the
jeffreys
house
since
the
wedding
had
been
given
out
by
her
or
by
the
man
for
whose
release
from
a
disappointing
matrimonial
entanglement
she
was
supposed
to
have
worked
this
though
the
suspicion
hanging
over
them
both
called
for
the
utmost
candor
verily
a
serious
list
and
opposed
to
this
i
had
as
yet
little
to
offer
but
my
own
belief
in
her
innocence
and
the
fact
but
little
dwelt
on
and
yet
not
without
its
value
that
the
money
which
had
come
to
jeffrey
and
the
home
which
had
been
given
her
had
both
been
forfeited
by
jeffrey
death
as
i
mused
and
mused
over
this
impromptu
synopsis
in
my
vain
attempt
to
reach
some
fresh
clue
to
a
proper
understanding
of
the
inconsistencies
in
miss
tuttle
conduct
by
means
of
my
theory
of
her
strong
but
mistaken
devotion
to
jeffrey
a
light
suddenly
broke
upon
me
from
an
entirely
unexpected
quarter
it
was
a
faint
one
but
any
glimmer
was
welcome
remembering
a
remark
made
by
jeffrey
in
his
examination
that
jeffrey
had
not
been
the
same
since
crossing
the
fatal
doorstep
of
the
moore
house
i
asked
myself
if
we
had
paid
enough
attention
to
the
mental
condition
and
conduct
of
the
bride
prior
to
the
alarm
which
threw
a
pall
of
horror
over
her
marriage
and
caught
by
the
idea
i
sought
for
a
fuller
account
of
the
events
of
that
day
than
had
hitherto
been
supplied
by
newspaper
or
witness
hunting
up
my
friend
the
reporter
i
begged
him
to
tell
me
where
he
had
obtained
the
facts
from
which
he
made
that
leading
article
in
the
star
which
had
so
startled
all
washington
on
the
evening
of
the
jeffrey
wedding
that
they
had
come
from
some
i
had
no
doubt
but
who
was
the
himself
no
who
then
at
first
he
declined
to
tell
me
but
after
a
fuller
understanding
of
my
motives
he
mentioned
the
name
of
a
young
lady
who
while
a
frequent
guest
at
the
most
fashionable
functions
was
not
above
supplying
the
papers
with
such
little
items
of
current
gossip
as
came
under
her
own
observation
how
i
managed
to
approach
this
lady
and
by
what
means
i
succeeded
in
gaining
her
confidence
are
details
quite
unnecessary
to
this
narrative
enough
that
i
did
obtain
access
to
her
and
that
she
talked
quite
frankly
to
me
and
in
so
doing
supplied
me
with
a
clue
which
ultimately
opened
up
to
me
an
entirely
new
field
of
inquiry
we
had
been
discussing
jeffrey
and
miss
tuttle
when
suddenly
and
with
no
apparent
motive
beyond
the
natural
love
of
gossip
which
was
her
weakness
she
launched
out
into
remarks
about
the
bride
the
ceremony
had
been
late
did
i
know
it
a
or
past
the
time
set
for
it
and
why
because
miss
moore
was
not
ready
she
had
chosen
to
array
herself
in
the
house
and
had
come
early
enough
for
the
purpose
but
she
would
not
accept
any
assistance
not
even
that
of
her
maid
and
of
course
she
kept
every
one
waiting
oh
there
was
no
more
uneasy
soul
in
the
whole
party
that
morning
than
the
bride
let
other
people
remark
upon
the
high
look
in
cora
tuttle
face
or
gossip
about
the
anxious
manner
of
the
bridegroom
she
the
speaker
could
tell
things
about
the
bride
which
would
go
to
show
that
she
was
not
all
right
even
before
that
ominous
reared
itself
into
view
at
her
marriage
festival
why
the
fact
that
she
came
downstairs
and
was
married
without
her
bridal
bouquet
was
enough
had
there
not
been
so
much
else
to
talk
about
people
would
have
talked
about
that
but
the
big
event
had
so
effectually
swallowed
up
the
little
that
only
herself
and
possibly
two
other
ladies
she
might
name
seemed
to
retain
any
memory
of
the
matter
what
ladies
i
asked
oh
it
does
matter
what
ladies
two
of
the
very
best
sort
i
know
they
noticed
it
because
i
heard
them
talking
about
it
we
were
all
standing
in
the
upper
hall
and
were
all
crowded
into
a
passage
leading
to
the
room
where
the
bride
was
dressing
it
was
before
the
alarm
had
gone
around
of
what
had
been
discovered
in
the
library
and
we
were
all
impatient
enough
for
the
appearance
of
the
bride
who
we
had
been
told
intended
to
wear
the
old
point
in
which
her
was
married
i
have
a
weakness
for
old
point
and
i
was
determined
to
stand
where
i
could
see
her
come
out
even
if
i
lost
sight
of
the
ceremony
itself
but
it
would
have
been
tedious
enough
waiting
in
that
close
hall
if
the
ladies
behind
me
had
not
kept
up
a
conversation
which
i
of
course
pretended
not
to
hear
i
remember
it
every
word
for
it
was
my
sole
amusement
for
half
an
hour
what
was
it
oh
it
was
about
that
same
bouquet
which
by
the
way
i
had
the
privilege
of
staring
at
all
the
time
they
chatted
for
the
boy
who
brought
it
had
not
been
admitted
into
miss
moore
room
and
not
knowing
what
else
to
do
with
it
was
lingering
before
her
door
with
the
great
streamers
falling
from
his
hands
and
the
lilies
making
the
whole
place
heavy
with
a
sickening
perfume
from
what
i
heard
the
ladies
say
he
had
been
standing
there
an
hour
and
the
timid
knock
he
gave
from
time
to
time
produced
in
me
an
odd
feeling
which
those
ladies
behind
me
seemed
to
share
a
shame
i
heard
one
of
them
cry
moore
has
no
excuse
for
such
thoughtlessness
it
is
an
hour
now
that
she
has
been
shut
up
in
her
room
alone
she
wo
have
even
her
maid
in
she
prefers
to
dress
alone
she
says
peculiar
in
a
bride
it
but
one
thing
is
certain
she
can
not
put
on
her
veil
without
help
she
will
have
to
call
some
one
in
for
that
at
which
the
other
volunteered
that
the
moores
were
all
queer
and
that
she
did
envy
francis
jeffrey
not
with
fifty
thousand
a
year
to
lighten
her
oddities
returned
her
companion
with
a
shrug
which
communicated
itself
to
me
so
closely
were
we
packed
together
have
a
son
who
could
bear
with
them
under
such
circumstances
indeed
she
has
and
all
washington
knows
it
but
the
remark
passed
without
comment
for
they
had
not
yet
exhausted
the
main
event
and
the
person
they
now
attacked
was
miss
tuttle
does
she
come
and
see
that
that
bouquet
is
taken
in
i
declare
it
not
decent
jeffrey
would
not
feel
complimented
if
he
knew
the
fate
of
those
magnificent
lilies
and
roses
i
presume
he
furnished
the
bouquet
tuttle
has
looked
out
of
her
room
once
i
heard
the
other
reply
is
in
splendid
beauty
but
pale
but
she
never
could
control
veronica
you
speak
louder
than
you
think
this
amused
me
and
i
do
believe
that
in
another
moment
i
should
have
laughed
outright
if
another
boy
had
not
appeared
in
the
hall
before
us
who
shoving
aside
the
first
rapped
on
the
door
with
a
spirit
which
called
for
answer
but
he
was
no
more
successful
than
the
other
boy
had
been
so
being
a
brisk
fellow
with
no
time
for
nonsense
he
called
out
bouquet
miss
and
a
message
which
i
am
to
give
you
before
you
go
downstairs
the
gentleman
is
quite
particular
about
it
these
words
were
literally
shouted
at
the
door
but
in
the
hubbub
of
voices
about
us
i
do
believe
any
one
heard
them
but
ourselves
and
the
bride
i
know
that
she
heard
them
for
she
opened
the
door
a
very
little
way
such
a
very
little
way
that
the
boy
had
to
put
his
lips
to
the
crack
when
he
spoke
and
then
turn
and
place
his
ear
where
his
lips
had
been
in
order
to
catch
her
reply
this
for
some
reason
seemed
a
long
time
in
coming
and
the
fellow
grew
so
impatient
that
he
amused
himself
by
snatching
the
bouquet
from
the
other
boy
and
thrusting
it
in
through
the
crack
to
the
very
great
detriment
of
its
roses
and
lilies
when
she
took
it
he
bawled
for
his
answer
and
when
he
got
it
he
stared
and
muttered
doubtfully
to
himself
as
he
worked
his
way
out
again
through
the
crowd
which
by
this
time
was
beginning
to
choke
up
all
the
halls
and
stairways
but
why
have
i
told
you
all
this
nonsense
she
asked
quite
suddenly
it
is
of
the
least
consequence
that
veronica
moore
kept
a
boy
waiting
at
her
door
while
she
dressed
herself
for
her
wedding
but
it
shows
that
she
was
queer
even
then
and
i
for
one
believe
in
the
theory
of
suicide
and
in
that
alone
and
in
the
excuse
she
gave
for
it
too
for
if
she
had
really
loved
francis
jeffrey
she
would
not
have
been
so
slow
to
take
in
the
magnificent
bouquet
he
had
provided
for
her
but
comment
even
from
those
who
had
known
these
people
well
was
not
what
i
wanted
at
this
moment
but
facts
so
without
much
attention
to
these
words
i
said
you
will
excuse
me
if
i
suggest
that
you
are
going
on
too
fast
the
door
of
the
bride
room
has
just
been
shut
upon
the
boy
who
brought
her
a
message
when
was
it
opened
again
not
for
a
good
not
till
every
one
had
grown
nervous
and
miss
tuttle
and
one
or
two
of
her
most
intimate
friends
had
gone
more
than
once
to
her
door
not
in
fact
till
the
hour
for
the
ceremony
had
come
and
gone
and
jeffrey
had
crossed
the
hall
twice
under
the
impression
that
she
was
ready
for
him
then
when
weariness
was
general
and
people
were
asking
what
kept
the
bride
and
how
much
longer
they
were
to
be
kept
waiting
her
door
suddenly
opened
and
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
face
and
heard
her
ask
at
last
for
her
maid
o
i
repeat
that
veronica
moore
was
not
all
right
that
day
and
though
i
have
heard
no
one
comment
on
the
fact
it
has
been
a
mystery
to
me
ever
since
why
she
gave
that
sudden
recoil
when
francis
jeffrey
took
her
hand
after
the
benediction
it
was
not
timidity
nor
was
it
fear
for
she
did
not
know
till
a
minute
afterward
what
had
happened
in
the
house
did
some
sudden
realization
of
what
she
had
done
in
marrying
a
man
whom
she
herself
declared
she
did
not
love
come
when
it
was
too
late
what
do
you
think
miss
freeman
had
forgotten
herself
but
the
impetuosity
which
had
led
her
into
asking
my
opinion
made
her
forget
in
another
moment
that
she
had
done
so
and
when
in
my
turn
i
propounded
a
question
and
inquired
whether
she
ever
again
saw
the
boy
who
besieged
the
bride
door
with
a
message
she
graciously
replied
the
boy
let
me
see
yes
i
saw
him
twice
once
in
a
back
hall
talking
earnestly
to
jeffrey
and
secondly
at
the
carriage
door
just
before
the
bridal
party
rode
away
it
was
jeffrey
who
was
talking
to
him
then
and
i
wondered
to
see
him
look
so
pleased
when
everybody
in
and
about
the
house
was
pale
as
ashes
do
you
know
the
name
of
that
boy
i
carelessly
inquired
his
name
o
no
he
is
one
of
raucher
waiters
the
one
you
see
him
everywhere
but
i
do
know
his
name
do
you
flatter
yourself
that
he
can
tell
you
anything
that
other
people
do
know
why
if
he
knew
the
least
thing
that
was
in
everybody
mouth
you
would
have
heard
from
him
long
ago
those
men
are
the
greatest
gossips
in
town
i
wonder
what
she
thought
of
herself
and
so
proud
to
be
of
any
importance
this
was
true
enough
though
i
did
not
admit
it
at
the
time
and
when
the
interview
was
closed
and
i
went
away
i
have
no
doubt
she
considered
me
quite
the
most
heavy
person
she
had
ever
met
but
this
did
not
disturb
me
the
little
facts
she
had
stated
were
new
to
me
and
repeating
my
former
method
i
was
already
busy
arranging
them
in
my
mind
witness
the
result
the
ceremony
of
marriage
between
francis
jeffrey
and
veronica
moore
was
fully
of
an
hour
late
this
was
owing
to
the
caprice
of
the
bride
who
would
not
have
any
one
in
the
room
with
her
not
even
her
maid
the
bridal
bouquet
did
not
figure
in
the
ceremony
in
the
flurry
of
the
moment
it
was
forgotten
or
purposely
left
behind
by
the
bride
as
this
bouquet
was
undoubtedly
the
gift
of
jeffrey
the
fact
may
be
significant
she
received
a
message
of
a
somewhat
peremptory
character
before
going
below
from
whom
her
bridegroom
it
would
so
appear
from
the
character
of
the
message
the
messenger
showed
great
astonishment
at
the
reply
he
was
given
to
carry
back
yet
he
has
not
been
known
to
mention
the
matter
why
when
every
one
talked
he
was
silent
through
whose
influence
this
was
something
to
find
out
though
at
the
time
the
benediction
was
pronounced
every
one
was
in
a
state
of
alarm
except
the
bride
it
was
noticed
that
she
gave
an
involuntary
recoil
when
her
bridegroom
stooped
for
the
customary
kiss
why
were
the
lines
of
her
last
farewell
true
then
and
did
she
experience
at
that
moment
a
sudden
realization
of
her
lack
of
love
she
did
not
go
again
upstairs
but
very
soon
fled
from
the
house
with
the
rest
of
the
bridal
party
petty
facts
all
but
possibly
more
significant
than
appeared
i
made
up
my
mind
to
find
the
boy
who
brought
the
bouquet
and
also
the
one
who
carried
back
her
message
but
here
a
surprise
if
not
a
check
awaited
me
the
florist
boy
had
left
his
place
and
no
one
could
tell
where
he
had
gone
neither
could
i
find
the
waiter
at
raucher
he
had
left
also
but
it
was
to
join
the
volunteers
at
san
antonio
was
there
meaning
in
this
coincidence
i
resolved
to
know
visiting
the
former
haunts
of
both
boys
i
failed
to
come
upon
any
evidence
of
an
understanding
between
them
or
of
their
having
shown
any
special
interest
in
the
jeffrey
tragedy
both
seemed
to
have
been
strangely
reticent
in
regard
to
it
the
florist
boy
showing
stupidity
and
the
waiter
such
satisfaction
in
his
prospective
soldiering
that
no
other
topic
was
deemed
worthy
his
attention
the
latter
had
a
sister
and
she
could
not
say
enough
of
the
delight
her
brother
had
shown
at
the
prospect
of
riding
a
horse
again
and
of
fighting
in
such
good
company
he
had
had
some
experience
as
a
cowboy
before
coming
to
washington
and
from
the
moment
war
was
declared
had
expressed
his
intention
of
joining
the
recruits
for
cuba
as
soon
as
he
could
see
her
so
provided
for
that
his
death
would
not
rob
her
of
proper
support
how
this
had
come
about
she
did
not
know
three
weeks
before
he
had
been
in
despair
over
the
faint
prospect
of
doing
what
he
wished
then
suddenly
and
without
any
explanation
of
how
the
change
had
come
about
he
had
rushed
in
upon
her
with
the
news
that
he
was
going
to
enlist
in
a
company
made
up
of
bronco
busters
and
rough
riders
from
the
west
that
she
need
not
worry
about
herself
or
about
him
for
he
had
just
put
five
hundred
dollars
to
her
account
in
bank
and
that
as
for
himself
he
possessed
a
charmed
life
and
was
immune
as
she
well
knew
and
need
fear
bullets
no
more
than
the
fever
by
this
he
meant
that
he
had
had
yellow
fever
years
before
in
louisiana
and
that
a
ball
which
had
once
been
fired
at
him
had
gone
clean
through
his
body
without
taking
his
life
what
was
the
date
of
the
evening
on
which
he
told
you
he
had
placed
money
in
bank
for
you
april
the
two
days
after
the
wedding
convinced
now
that
his
departure
from
town
was
something
more
than
a
coincidence
i
pursued
my
inquiries
and
found
that
he
had
been
received
just
as
she
had
said
into
the
first
volunteer
corps
under
colonel
wood
this
required
influence
whose
was
the
influence
it
took
me
some
time
to
find
out
but
after
many
and
various
attempts
most
of
which
ended
in
failure
i
succeeded
in
learning
that
the
man
who
had
worked
and
obtained
for
him
a
place
in
this
favored
corps
was
francis
jeffrey
xviii
in
the
grass
i
did
some
tall
thinking
that
night
i
remembered
that
this
man
had
held
some
conversation
with
the
jeffreys
at
their
carriage
door
previous
to
their
departure
from
the
moore
house
and
found
myself
compelled
to
believe
that
only
a
matter
of
importance
to
themselves
as
well
as
to
him
would
have
detained
them
at
such
a
minute
oh
that
tampa
were
not
so
far
off
or
that
i
had
happened
on
this
clue
earlier
but
tampa
was
at
that
moment
a
far
prospect
for
me
and
i
could
only
reason
from
such
facts
as
i
had
been
able
to
collect
in
washington
fixing
my
mind
now
on
jeffrey
i
asked
the
cause
of
the
many
caprices
which
had
marked
her
conduct
on
her
wedding
morning
why
had
she
persisted
in
dressing
alone
and
what
occasioned
the
absorption
which
led
to
her
ignoring
all
appeals
at
her
door
at
a
time
when
a
woman
is
supposed
to
be
more
than
usually
gracious
but
one
answer
suggested
itself
her
heart
was
not
in
her
marriage
and
that
last
hour
of
her
maidenhood
had
been
an
hour
of
anguish
and
struggle
perhaps
she
not
only
failed
to
love
francis
jeffrey
but
loved
some
other
man
this
seemed
improbable
but
things
as
strange
as
this
have
happened
in
our
complex
society
and
no
reckoning
can
be
made
with
a
woman
fancy
if
this
was
so
and
what
other
theory
would
better
or
even
so
well
account
for
her
peculiar
behavior
both
then
and
afterward
the
hour
usually
given
by
brides
to
dress
and
gladsome
expectation
was
with
her
one
of
farewell
to
past
hopes
and
an
unfortunate
if
not
passionate
attachment
no
wonder
that
she
wished
to
be
alone
no
wonder
that
interruption
angered
her
perhaps
it
had
found
her
on
her
knees
perhaps
here
i
felt
myself
seized
by
a
strong
and
sudden
excitement
i
remembered
the
filings
i
had
gathered
up
from
the
small
stand
by
the
window
filings
which
had
glittered
and
which
must
have
been
of
gold
what
was
the
conclusion
in
this
last
hour
of
her
maiden
life
she
had
sought
to
rid
herself
of
some
article
of
jewelry
which
she
found
it
undesirable
to
carry
into
her
new
life
what
article
of
jewelry
in
consideration
of
the
circumstances
and
the
hour
i
could
think
of
but
one
a
ring
the
symbol
of
some
old
attachment
the
slight
abrasion
at
the
base
of
her
third
finger
which
had
been
looked
upon
as
the
result
of
too
rough
and
speedy
a
withdrawing
of
the
on
the
evening
of
her
death
was
much
more
likely
to
have
been
occasioned
by
the
reopening
of
some
little
wound
made
two
weeks
before
by
the
file
if
durbin
and
the
rest
had
taken
into
account
these
filings
they
must
have
come
to
very
much
the
same
conclusion
but
either
they
had
overlooked
them
in
their
search
about
the
place
or
having
noted
them
regarded
them
as
a
clue
leading
nowhere
but
for
me
they
led
the
way
to
a
very
definite
inquiry
asking
to
see
the
rings
jeffrey
had
left
behind
her
on
the
night
she
went
for
the
last
time
to
the
moore
house
i
looked
them
carefully
over
and
found
that
none
of
them
showed
the
least
mark
of
the
file
this
strengthened
my
theory
and
i
proceeded
to
take
my
next
step
with
increased
confidence
it
seemed
an
easy
one
but
proved
unexpectedly
difficult
my
desire
was
to
ascertain
whether
she
had
worn
previous
to
her
marriage
any
rings
which
had
not
been
seen
on
her
finger
since
and
it
took
me
one
whole
week
to
establish
the
fact
that
she
had
but
that
fact
once
learned
the
way
cleared
before
me
allowing
my
fancy
full
rein
i
pictured
to
myself
her
anxious
figure
standing
alone
in
that
ancient
and
ghostly
room
filing
off
this
old
ring
from
her
dainty
finger
then
i
asked
myself
what
she
would
be
likely
to
do
with
this
ring
after
disengaging
it
from
her
hand
would
she
keep
it
perhaps
but
if
so
why
could
it
not
be
found
none
such
had
been
discovered
among
her
effects
or
had
she
thrown
it
away
and
if
so
where
the
vision
of
her
which
i
had
just
seen
in
my
mind
eye
came
out
with
a
clearness
at
this
which
struck
me
as
providential
i
could
discern
as
plainly
as
if
i
had
been
a
part
of
the
scene
the
form
of
the
bride
bending
toward
the
light
which
came
in
sparsely
through
the
shutter
she
had
loosened
for
this
task
this
was
the
shutter
which
had
never
again
been
fastened
and
whose
restless
blowing
to
and
fro
had
first
led
attention
to
this
house
and
the
crime
it
might
otherwise
have
concealed
indefinitely
had
some
glimpse
of
the
rank
grass
growing
underneath
this
window
lured
her
eye
and
led
her
to
cast
away
the
ring
which
she
had
no
longer
any
right
to
keep
it
would
be
like
a
woman
to
yield
to
such
an
impulse
and
on
the
strength
of
the
possibility
i
decided
to
search
this
small
plot
for
what
it
might
very
reasonably
conceal
but
i
did
not
wish
to
do
this
openly
i
was
not
only
afraid
of
attracting
durbin
attention
by
an
attempt
which
could
only
awaken
his
disdain
but
i
hesitated
to
arouse
the
suspicion
of
moore
whose
interest
in
his
newly
acquired
property
made
him
very
properly
alert
to
any
trespass
upon
it
the
undertaking
therefore
presented
difficulties
but
it
was
my
business
to
overcome
these
and
before
long
i
conceived
a
plan
by
which
every
blade
of
grass
in
the
narrow
strip
running
in
front
of
this
house
might
be
gone
over
without
rousing
anything
more
serious
than
uncle
david
ire
calling
together
a
posse
of
street
urchins
i
organized
them
into
a
band
with
the
promise
of
a
good
supper
all
around
if
one
of
them
brought
me
the
pieces
of
a
broken
ring
which
i
had
lost
in
the
grass
plot
of
a
house
where
i
had
been
called
upon
to
stay
all
night
that
they
might
win
the
supper
in
the
shortest
possible
time
and
before
the
owner
of
this
house
who
lived
opposite
could
interfere
i
advised
them
to
start
at
the
fence
in
a
long
line
and
proceeding
on
their
knees
to
search
each
one
the
ground
before
him
to
the
width
of
his
own
body
the
fortunate
one
was
to
have
the
privilege
of
saying
what
the
supper
should
consist
of
to
give
a
plausible
excuse
for
this
search
a
ball
was
to
be
tossed
up
and
down
the
street
till
it
lighted
in
the
moore
house
inclosure
it
was
a
scheme
to
fire
the
street
boy
soul
and
i
was
only
afraid
of
failure
from
the
it
aroused
but
the
injunctions
which
i
gave
them
to
spare
the
shrubs
and
not
to
trample
the
grass
any
more
than
was
necessary
were
so
minute
and
impressive
that
they
moved
away
to
their
task
in
unexpected
order
and
with
a
subdued
cheerfulness
highly
promising
of
success
i
did
not
accompany
them
jinny
who
has
such
an
innocent
air
on
the
street
took
my
place
and
promenaded
up
and
down
the
block
just
to
see
that
moore
did
not
make
too
much
trouble
and
it
was
well
she
did
so
for
though
he
was
not
at
home
i
had
chosen
the
hour
of
his
afternoon
ride
his
new
was
and
he
no
sooner
perceived
this
crowd
of
urchins
making
for
the
opposite
house
than
he
rushed
at
them
and
would
have
scattered
them
far
and
wide
in
a
twinkling
if
the
demure
dimples
of
my
little
ally
had
not
come
into
play
and
distracted
his
attention
so
completely
as
to
make
him
forget
the
throng
of
unkempt
hoodlums
who
seemed
bound
to
invade
his
master
property
she
was
looking
for
moore
house
she
told
him
did
he
know
moore
and
his
house
which
was
somewhere
near
not
his
new
great
big
house
where
the
horrible
things
took
place
of
which
she
had
read
in
the
papers
but
his
little
old
house
which
she
had
heard
was
soon
to
be
for
rent
and
which
she
thought
would
be
just
the
right
size
for
herself
and
mother
was
that
it
that
dear
little
place
all
smothered
in
vines
how
lovely
and
what
would
the
rent
be
did
he
think
and
had
it
a
with
enough
for
her
to
raise
pinks
and
nasturtiums
and
so
on
and
so
on
while
he
stared
with
delighted
eyes
and
tried
to
put
in
a
word
edgewise
and
the
boys
well
they
went
through
that
strip
of
grass
in
just
ten
minutes
my
brave
little
jinny
had
just
declared
with
her
most
roguish
smile
that
she
would
run
home
and
tell
her
mother
all
about
this
sweetest
of
sweet
little
places
when
a
shout
rose
from
the
other
side
of
the
street
and
that
collection
of
fifteen
or
twenty
boys
scampered
away
as
if
mad
shouting
in
joyous
echo
of
the
boy
at
their
head
it
to
be
chicken
heaping
plates
of
ice
cream
and
sponge
cake
by
which
token
she
knew
that
the
ring
had
been
found
when
they
brought
this
ring
to
me
i
would
not
have
exchanged
places
with
any
man
on
earth
as
jinny
herself
was
curious
enough
to
stroll
along
about
this
time
i
held
it
out
where
we
both
could
see
it
and
draw
our
conclusions
it
was
a
plain
gold
circlet
set
with
a
single
small
ruby
it
was
cut
through
and
twisted
out
of
shape
just
as
i
had
anticipated
and
as
i
examined
it
i
wondered
what
part
it
had
played
and
was
yet
destined
to
play
in
the
drama
of
veronica
jeffrey
mysterious
life
and
still
more
mysterious
death
that
it
was
a
factor
of
some
importance
arguing
some
early
love
i
could
but
gather
from
the
fact
that
its
removal
from
her
finger
was
effected
in
secrecy
and
under
circumstances
of
such
pressing
haste
how
could
i
learn
the
story
of
that
ring
and
the
possible
connection
between
it
and
jeffrey
professed
jealousy
of
his
wife
and
the
disappointing
honeymoon
which
had
followed
their
marriage
that
this
feeling
on
his
part
had
antedated
the
ambassador
ball
no
one
could
question
but
that
it
had
started
as
far
back
as
the
wedding
day
was
a
new
idea
to
me
and
one
which
suggested
many
possibilities
could
this
idea
be
established
and
if
so
how
but
one
avenue
of
inquiry
offered
itself
the
waiter
who
had
been
spirited
away
so
curiously
immediately
after
the
wedding
might
be
able
to
give
us
some
information
on
this
interesting
point
he
had
been
the
medium
of
the
messages
which
had
passed
between
her
and
jeffrey
just
prior
to
the
ceremony
afterward
he
had
been
seen
talking
earnestly
to
that
gentleman
and
later
with
her
certainly
it
would
add
to
our
understanding
of
the
situation
to
know
what
reply
she
had
sent
to
the
peremptory
demand
made
upon
her
at
so
critical
a
time
an
understanding
so
desirable
that
the
very
prospect
of
it
was
almost
enough
to
warrant
a
journey
to
tampa
yet
say
that
the
results
were
disappointing
how
much
time
lost
and
what
a
sum
of
money
i
felt
the
need
of
advice
in
this
crisis
yet
hesitated
to
ask
it
my
cursed
pride
and
my
no
less
cursed
jealousy
of
durbin
stood
very
much
in
my
way
at
this
time
a
week
had
now
passed
since
the
inquest
and
while
miss
tuttle
still
remained
at
liberty
it
was
a
circumscribed
liberty
which
must
have
been
very
galling
to
one
of
her
temperament
and
habits
she
rode
and
she
walked
but
she
entered
no
house
unattended
nor
was
she
allowed
any
communication
with
jeffrey
nevertheless
she
saw
him
or
at
least
gave
him
the
opportunity
of
seeing
her
each
day
at
three
she
rode
through
k
street
and
the
detective
who
watched
jeffrey
house
said
that
she
never
passed
it
without
turning
her
face
to
the
window
where
he
invariably
stood
no
signs
passed
between
them
indeed
they
scarcely
nodded
but
her
face
as
she
lifted
it
to
meet
his
eye
showed
so
marked
a
serenity
and
was
so
altogether
beautiful
that
this
same
detective
had
a
desire
to
see
if
it
maintained
like
characteristics
when
she
was
not
within
reach
of
her
accordingly
the
next
day
he
delegated
his
place
to
another
and
took
his
stand
farther
down
the
street
alas
it
was
not
the
same
woman
face
he
saw
but
a
far
different
and
sadder
one
she
wore
that
look
of
courage
and
brave
hope
only
in
passing
jeffrey
house
was
it
simply
an
expression
of
her
secret
devotion
to
him
or
the
signal
of
some
compact
which
had
been
entered
into
between
them
whichever
it
was
it
touched
my
heart
even
in
his
description
of
it
after
advising
with
jinny
i
approached
the
superintendent
to
whom
without
further
reserve
i
opened
my
heart
the
next
day
i
found
myself
on
the
train
bound
for
tampa
with
full
authority
to
follow
curly
jim
until
i
found
him
book
iii
the
house
of
doom
xix
in
tampa
when
i
started
on
this
desperate
search
after
a
witness
war
had
been
declared
but
no
advance
as
yet
ordered
on
cuba
but
during
my
journey
south
the
long
expected
event
happened
and
on
my
arrival
in
tampa
i
found
myself
in
the
midst
of
departure
and
everything
in
confusion
of
course
under
such
conditions
it
was
difficult
to
find
my
man
on
the
instant
innumerable
inquiries
yielded
no
result
and
in
the
absence
of
any
one
who
would
or
could
give
me
the
desired
information
i
wandered
from
one
end
of
the
camp
to
the
other
till
i
finally
encountered
a
petty
officer
who
gave
signs
of
being
a
rough
rider
him
i
stopped
and
with
some
hint
of
my
business
asked
where
james
calvert
could
be
found
his
answer
was
a
stare
and
a
gesture
toward
the
hospital
tents
nothing
could
have
astonished
me
more
sick
i
cried
dying
was
his
answer
dying
curly
jim
impossible
i
had
misled
my
informant
as
to
the
exact
man
i
wanted
or
else
there
were
two
james
calverts
in
tampa
curly
jim
the
former
cowboy
was
not
the
fellow
to
succumb
in
camp
before
he
had
ever
smelt
powder
it
is
james
calvert
of
the
first
volunteer
corps
i
am
after
said
i
a
sturdy
fellow
no
doubt
no
doubt
many
sturdy
fellows
are
down
he
down
to
stay
typhoid
you
know
bad
case
no
hope
from
the
start
pity
but
i
heard
no
more
dying
curly
jim
he
who
was
considered
to
be
immune
he
who
held
the
secret
let
me
see
him
i
demanded
it
is
important
a
police
matter
a
word
from
him
may
save
a
life
he
is
still
breathing
yes
but
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
chance
of
his
speaking
he
did
not
recognize
his
nurse
five
minutes
ago
as
bad
as
that
but
i
did
not
despair
i
did
not
dare
to
i
had
staked
everything
on
this
interview
and
i
was
not
going
to
lose
its
promised
results
from
any
lack
of
effort
on
my
own
part
let
me
see
him
i
repeated
i
was
taken
in
the
few
persons
i
saw
clustered
about
a
narrow
cot
in
one
corner
gave
way
and
i
was
cut
to
the
heart
to
see
that
they
did
this
not
so
much
out
of
consideration
for
me
or
my
errand
there
as
from
the
consciousness
that
their
business
at
the
bedside
of
this
dying
man
was
over
he
was
on
the
point
of
breathing
his
last
i
pressed
forward
and
after
one
quick
scrutiny
of
the
closed
eyes
and
pale
face
i
knelt
at
his
side
and
whispered
a
name
into
his
ear
it
was
that
of
veronica
moore
he
started
they
all
saw
it
on
the
threshold
of
death
some
emotion
we
never
knew
what
one
drew
him
back
for
an
instant
and
the
pale
cheek
showed
a
suspicion
of
color
though
the
eyes
did
not
open
the
lips
moved
and
i
caught
these
words
kept
word
told
no
one
she
was
so
and
that
was
all
he
died
the
next
instant
well
i
was
woefully
done
up
by
this
sudden
extinction
of
all
my
hopes
they
had
been
extravagant
no
doubt
but
they
had
sustained
me
through
all
my
haps
and
mishaps
trials
and
dangers
till
now
here
they
ended
with
the
one
inexorable
was
i
doomed
to
defeat
then
must
i
go
back
to
the
major
with
my
convictions
unchanged
but
with
no
fresh
proof
no
real
evidence
to
support
them
i
certainly
must
with
the
death
of
this
man
all
means
of
reaching
the
state
of
jeffrey
mind
immediately
preceding
her
marriage
were
gone
i
could
never
learn
now
what
to
know
would
make
a
man
of
me
and
possibly
save
cora
tuttle
bending
under
this
stroke
of
providence
i
passed
out
a
little
boy
was
sobbing
at
the
tent
door
i
stared
at
him
curiously
and
was
hurrying
on
when
i
felt
myself
caught
by
the
hand
take
me
with
you
cried
a
choked
and
frightened
voice
in
my
ear
i
have
no
friend
here
now
he
is
gone
take
me
back
to
washington
washington
i
turned
and
looked
at
the
lad
who
kneeling
in
the
hot
sand
at
the
door
of
the
tent
was
clutching
me
with
imploring
hands
who
are
you
i
asked
and
how
came
you
here
do
you
belong
to
the
army
i
helped
care
for
his
horse
he
whispered
he
found
me
smuggled
on
board
the
train
for
i
was
bound
to
go
to
the
war
and
he
was
sorry
for
me
and
used
to
give
me
bits
of
his
own
rations
but
but
now
no
one
will
give
me
anything
take
me
back
she
wo
care
she
dead
they
say
besides
i
would
stay
here
now
if
she
was
alive
and
breathing
i
have
had
enough
of
war
since
he
oh
he
was
good
to
me
i
never
cared
for
any
one
so
much
i
looked
at
the
boy
with
an
odd
sensation
for
which
i
have
no
name
whom
are
you
talking
about
i
asked
your
mother
your
sister
oh
no
the
tone
was
simplicity
itself
never
had
no
mother
i
mean
the
lady
at
the
big
house
the
one
that
was
married
she
gave
me
money
to
go
out
of
washington
and
wanting
to
be
a
soldier
i
followed
curly
jim
i
did
think
he
die
he
looked
so
strong
what
the
matter
sir
have
i
said
anything
i
should
i
had
him
by
the
arm
i
fear
that
i
was
shaking
him
the
lady
i
repeated
she
who
was
married
who
gave
you
money
was
it
mrs
jeffrey
yes
i
believe
that
was
the
name
of
the
man
she
married
i
know
him
but
i
saw
he
where
and
why
did
she
give
you
money
i
will
take
you
home
with
me
if
you
tell
me
the
truth
about
it
he
glanced
back
at
the
tent
from
which
i
had
slightly
drawn
him
and
a
hungry
look
crept
into
his
eyes
well
it
no
secret
now
he
muttered
he
used
to
say
i
must
keep
my
mouth
shut
but
he
would
say
so
now
if
he
knew
i
could
get
home
by
telling
he
used
to
be
sorry
for
me
he
used
what
do
you
want
to
know
why
jeffrey
gave
you
money
to
leave
washington
the
boy
trembled
drew
a
step
away
and
then
came
back
and
under
those
hot
florida
skies
in
the
turmoil
of
departing
troops
i
heard
these
words
because
i
heard
what
she
said
to
jim
i
felt
my
heart
go
down
then
up
up
beyond
anything
i
had
ever
experienced
in
my
whole
life
the
way
before
me
was
not
closed
then
a
witness
yet
remained
though
jim
was
dead
the
boy
was
oblivious
of
my
emotion
he
was
staring
with
great
mournfulness
t
the
tent
and
what
was
that
said
i
his
attention
which
had
been
wandering
came
back
and
it
was
with
some
surprise
he
said
it
was
not
much
she
told
him
to
take
the
gentleman
into
the
library
but
it
was
the
library
where
men
died
and
he
just
went
and
died
there
too
you
remember
and
jim
said
he
was
ever
going
to
speak
of
it
and
so
i
promised
not
to
neither
but
but
when
do
you
think
you
will
be
starting
sir
i
did
not
answer
him
i
was
feeling
very
queer
as
men
feel
i
suppose
who
in
some
crisis
or
event
recognize
an
unexpected
interposition
of
providence
are
you
the
boy
who
ran
away
from
the
florist
in
washington
i
inquired
when
ready
to
speak
the
boy
who
delivered
miss
bridal
bouquet
yes
sir
i
let
go
of
his
hand
and
sat
down
surely
there
was
a
power
greater
than
chance
governing
this
matter
through
what
devious
ways
and
from
what
unexpected
sources
had
i
come
upon
this
knowledge
jeffrey
or
miss
moore
as
she
was
then
told
jim
to
seat
the
gentleman
in
the
library
i
now
said
why
i
do
not
know
he
told
her
the
gentleman
name
and
then
she
whispered
him
that
i
heard
her
and
that
was
why
i
got
money
too
but
it
all
gone
now
oh
sir
when
are
you
going
back
i
started
to
my
feet
was
it
in
answer
to
this
appeal
or
because
i
realized
that
i
had
come
at
last
upon
a
clue
calling
for
immediate
action
i
am
going
now
said
i
and
you
are
going
with
me
run
for
the
train
we
take
leaves
inside
of
ten
minutes
my
business
here
is
over
xx
the
colonel
own
words
can
not
express
the
tediousness
of
that
return
journey
the
affair
which
occupied
all
my
thoughts
was
as
yet
too
much
enveloped
in
mystery
for
me
to
contemplate
it
with
anything
but
an
anxious
and
inquiring
mind
while
i
clung
with
new
and
persistent
hope
to
the
thread
which
had
been
put
in
my
hand
i
was
too
conscious
of
the
maze
through
which
we
must
yet
pass
before
the
light
could
be
reached
to
feel
that
lightness
of
spirit
which
in
itself
might
have
lessened
the
hours
and
made
bearable
those
days
of
forced
inaction
to
beguile
the
way
a
little
i
made
a
complete
analysis
of
the
facts
as
they
appeared
to
me
in
the
light
of
this
latest
bit
of
evidence
the
result
was
not
strikingly
encouraging
yet
i
will
insert
it
if
only
in
proof
of
my
diligence
and
the
extreme
interest
i
experienced
in
each
and
every
stage
of
this
perplexing
affair
it
again
took
the
form
of
a
summary
and
read
as
follows
facts
as
they
now
appear
the
peremptory
demand
for
an
interview
which
had
been
delivered
to
miss
moore
during
the
preceding
her
marriage
had
come
not
from
the
bridegroom
as
i
had
supposed
but
from
the
stranger
pfeiffer
her
reply
to
this
demand
had
been
an
order
for
that
gentleman
to
be
seated
in
the
library
the
messenger
carrying
this
order
had
been
met
and
earnestly
talked
with
by
jeffrey
either
immediately
before
or
immediately
after
the
aforementioned
gentleman
had
been
so
seated
death
reached
pfeiffer
before
the
bride
did
miss
moore
remained
in
ignorance
of
this
catastrophe
till
after
her
marriage
no
intimation
of
the
same
having
been
given
her
by
the
few
persons
allowed
to
approach
her
before
she
descended
to
her
nuptials
yet
she
was
seen
to
shrink
unaccountably
when
her
lips
touched
hers
and
when
informed
of
the
dreadful
event
before
which
she
beheld
all
her
guests
fleeing
went
from
the
house
a
changed
woman
for
all
this
proof
that
pfeiffer
was
well
known
to
her
if
not
to
the
rest
of
the
bridal
party
no
acknowledgment
of
this
was
made
by
any
of
them
then
or
afterward
nor
any
contradiction
given
either
by
husband
or
wife
to
the
accepted
theory
that
this
seeming
stranger
from
the
west
had
gone
into
this
fatal
room
of
the
to
gratify
his
own
morbid
curiosity
on
the
contrary
an
extraordinary
effort
was
immediately
made
by
jeffrey
to
rid
himself
of
the
only
witnesses
who
could
tell
the
truth
concerning
those
fatal
ten
minutes
but
this
brought
no
peace
to
the
miserable
wife
who
never
again
saw
a
really
happy
moment
extraordinary
efforts
at
concealment
argue
extraordinary
causes
for
fear
fully
too
understand
the
circumstances
of
death
it
would
be
necessary
first
to
know
what
had
happened
in
the
moore
house
when
jeffrey
learned
from
curly
jim
that
the
man
whose
hold
upon
his
bride
had
been
such
that
he
dared
to
demand
an
interview
with
her
just
as
she
was
on
the
point
of
descending
to
her
nuptials
had
been
seated
or
was
about
to
be
seated
in
the
room
where
death
had
once
held
its
court
and
might
easily
be
persuaded
to
hold
court
again
this
was
the
limit
of
my
conclusions
i
could
get
no
further
and
awaited
my
arrival
in
washington
with
the
greatest
impatience
but
once
there
and
the
responsibility
of
this
new
inquiry
shifted
to
broader
shoulders
than
my
own
i
was
greatly
surprised
and
as
deeply
chagrined
to
observe
the
whole
affair
lag
unaccountably
and
to
note
that
in
spite
of
my
important
discoveries
the
prosecution
continued
working
up
the
case
against
miss
tuttle
in
manifest
intention
of
presenting
it
to
the
grand
jury
at
its
fall
sitting
whether
durbin
was
to
blame
for
this
i
could
not
say
certainly
his
look
was
more
or
less
quizzical
when
next
we
met
and
this
nettled
me
so
that
i
at
once
came
to
the
determination
that
whatever
was
in
his
mind
or
in
the
minds
of
the
men
whose
counsels
he
undoubtedly
shared
i
was
going
to
make
one
more
great
effort
on
my
own
account
not
to
solve
the
main
mystery
which
had
passed
out
of
my
hands
but
to
reach
the
hidden
cause
of
the
equally
unexplained
deaths
which
had
occurred
from
time
to
time
at
the
library
fireplace
for
nothing
could
now
persuade
me
that
the
two
mysteries
were
not
indissolubly
connected
or
that
the
elucidation
of
the
one
would
not
lead
to
the
elucidation
of
the
other
to
be
sure
it
was
well
accepted
at
headquarters
that
all
possible
attempts
had
been
made
in
this
direction
and
with
nothing
but
failure
as
a
result
the
floor
the
hearth
the
chimney
and
above
all
the
old
settle
had
been
thoroughly
searched
but
to
no
avail
the
secret
had
not
been
reached
and
had
almost
come
to
be
looked
upon
as
insolvable
but
i
was
not
one
to
be
affected
by
other
men
failures
the
encouragement
afforded
me
by
my
late
discoveries
was
such
that
i
felt
confident
that
nothing
could
hinder
my
success
save
the
necessity
of
completely
pulling
down
the
house
besides
all
investigation
had
hitherto
started
if
it
had
not
ended
in
the
library
i
was
resolved
to
begin
work
in
quite
a
different
spot
i
had
not
forgotten
the
sensations
i
had
experienced
in
the
southwest
chamber
during
my
absence
this
house
had
been
released
from
surveillance
but
the
major
still
held
the
keys
and
i
had
no
difficulty
in
obtaining
them
the
next
thing
was
to
escape
its
owner
vigilance
this
i
managed
to
do
through
the
assistance
of
jinny
and
when
midnight
came
and
all
lights
went
out
in
the
opposite
cottage
i
entered
boldly
upon
the
scene
as
before
i
went
first
of
all
to
the
library
it
was
important
to
know
at
the
outset
that
this
room
was
in
its
normal
condition
but
this
was
not
my
only
reason
for
prefacing
my
new
efforts
by
a
visit
to
this
scene
of
death
and
mysterious
horror
i
had
another
so
seemingly
puerile
that
i
almost
hesitate
to
mention
it
and
would
not
if
the
sequel
warranted
its
omission
i
wished
to
make
certain
that
i
had
exhausted
every
suspected
as
well
as
every
known
clue
to
the
information
i
sought
in
my
long
journey
home
and
the
hours
of
thought
it
had
forced
upon
me
i
had
more
than
once
been
visited
by
flitting
visions
of
things
seen
in
this
old
house
and
afterward
nearly
forgotten
among
these
was
the
book
which
on
that
first
night
of
hurried
search
had
given
proofs
of
being
in
some
one
hand
within
a
very
short
period
the
attention
i
had
given
it
at
a
moment
of
such
haste
was
necessarily
cursory
and
when
later
a
second
opportunity
was
granted
me
of
looking
into
it
again
i
had
allowed
a
very
slight
obstacle
to
deter
me
this
was
a
mistake
i
was
anxious
to
rectify
anything
which
had
been
touched
with
purpose
at
or
near
the
time
of
so
mysterious
a
tragedy
and
the
position
of
this
book
on
a
shelf
so
high
that
a
chair
was
needed
to
reach
it
proved
that
it
had
been
sought
and
touched
with
purpose
held
out
the
promise
of
a
clue
which
one
on
so
blind
a
trail
as
myself
could
not
afford
to
ignore
but
when
i
had
taken
the
book
down
and
read
again
its
totally
uninteresting
and
unsuggestive
title
and
by
another
reference
to
its
dim
and
faded
leaves
found
that
my
memory
had
not
played
me
false
and
that
it
contained
nothing
but
stupid
and
wholly
irrelevant
statistics
my
confidence
in
it
as
a
possible
aid
in
the
work
i
had
in
hand
departed
just
as
it
had
on
the
previous
occasion
i
was
about
to
put
it
back
on
the
shelf
when
i
bethought
me
of
running
my
hand
in
behind
the
two
books
between
which
it
had
stood
ah
that
was
it
another
book
lay
flat
against
the
wall
at
the
back
of
the
shelf
and
when
by
the
removal
of
those
in
front
i
was
enabled
to
draw
this
book
out
i
soon
saw
why
it
had
been
relegated
to
such
a
remote
place
of
concealment
on
the
shelves
of
the
moore
library
it
was
a
collection
of
obscure
memoirs
written
by
an
english
woman
but
an
english
woman
who
had
been
in
america
during
the
early
part
of
the
century
and
who
had
been
brought
more
or
less
into
contact
with
the
mysteries
connected
with
the
moore
house
in
washington
several
passages
were
marked
one
particularly
by
a
heavy
running
the
length
of
the
margin
as
the
name
of
moore
was
freely
scattered
through
these
passages
as
well
as
through
two
or
three
faded
newspaper
clippings
which
i
discovered
pasted
on
the
inside
cover
i
lost
no
time
in
setting
about
their
perusal
the
following
extracts
are
from
the
book
itself
taken
in
the
order
in
which
i
found
them
marked
it
was
about
this
time
that
i
spent
a
week
in
the
moore
house
that
grand
and
historic
structure
concerning
which
and
its
occupants
so
many
curious
rumors
are
afloat
i
knew
nothing
then
of
its
discreditable
fame
but
from
the
first
moment
of
my
entrance
into
its
ample
and
well
lighted
halls
i
experienced
a
sensation
which
i
will
not
call
dread
but
which
certainly
was
far
from
being
the
impulse
of
pure
delight
which
the
graciousness
of
my
hostess
and
the
imposing
character
of
the
place
itself
were
calculated
to
produce
this
emotion
was
but
transitory
vanishing
as
was
natural
in
the
excitement
of
my
welcome
and
the
extraordinary
interest
i
took
in
callista
moore
who
in
those
days
was
a
most
fascinating
little
body
small
to
the
point
of
appearing
diminutive
and
lacking
all
assertion
in
manner
and
bearing
she
was
nevertheless
such
a
lady
that
she
easily
dominated
all
who
approached
her
and
produced
quite
against
her
will
i
am
sure
an
impression
of
aloofness
seasoned
with
kindness
which
made
her
a
most
surprising
and
entertaining
study
to
the
analytic
observer
her
position
as
nominal
mistress
of
an
establishment
already
accounted
one
of
the
finest
in
washington
the
real
owner
reuben
moore
preferring
to
live
abroad
with
his
french
wife
gave
to
her
least
action
an
importance
which
her
shy
if
not
appealing
looks
and
a
certain
strained
expression
most
difficult
to
characterize
vainly
attempted
to
contradict
i
could
not
understand
her
and
soon
gave
up
the
attempt
but
my
admiration
held
firm
and
by
the
time
the
evening
was
half
over
i
was
her
obedient
slave
i
think
from
what
i
know
of
her
now
that
she
would
have
preferred
to
be
mine
i
was
put
to
sleep
in
a
great
chamber
which
i
afterward
heard
called
colonel
own
it
was
very
grand
and
had
a
great
bed
in
it
almost
royal
in
its
size
and
splendor
i
believe
that
i
shrank
quite
unaccountably
from
this
imposing
piece
of
furniture
when
i
first
looked
at
it
it
seemed
so
big
and
so
out
of
proportion
to
my
slim
little
body
but
admonished
by
the
look
which
i
surprised
on
mistress
callista
face
i
quickly
recalled
an
expression
so
unsuited
to
my
position
as
guest
and
with
a
gush
of
rapture
began
to
expatiate
upon
the
interesting
characteristics
of
the
room
and
express
myself
as
delighted
at
the
prospect
of
sleeping
there
instantly
the
nervous
look
left
her
and
with
the
quiet
remark
was
my
father
room
she
set
down
the
candles
with
which
both
her
hands
were
burdened
and
gave
me
a
kiss
so
warm
and
surcharged
with
feeling
that
it
sufficed
to
keep
me
happy
and
comfortable
for
a
or
more
after
she
passed
out
i
had
thought
myself
a
very
sleepy
girl
but
when
after
a
somewhat
lengthened
brooding
over
the
dying
embers
in
the
open
fireplace
i
lay
down
behind
the
curtains
of
the
huge
bed
i
found
myself
as
far
from
sleep
as
i
had
ever
been
in
my
whole
life
and
i
did
not
recover
from
this
condition
for
the
entire
night
for
hours
i
tossed
from
one
side
of
the
bed
to
the
other
in
my
efforts
to
avoid
the
persistent
eyes
of
a
drawing
facing
me
from
the
opposite
wall
it
had
no
merit
as
a
picture
this
drawing
but
seen
as
it
was
under
the
rays
of
a
gibbous
moon
looking
in
through
the
shutter
it
exercised
upon
me
a
spell
such
as
i
can
not
describe
and
hope
never
again
to
experience
finally
i
rose
and
pulled
the
curtains
violently
together
across
the
foot
of
the
bed
this
shut
out
the
picture
but
i
found
it
worse
to
imagine
it
there
with
its
haunting
eyes
peering
at
me
through
the
intervening
folds
of
heavy
damask
than
to
confront
it
openly
so
i
pushed
the
curtains
back
again
only
to
rise
a
later
and
twitch
them
desperately
together
once
more
i
fidgeted
and
worried
so
that
night
that
i
must
have
looked
quite
pale
when
my
attentive
hostess
met
me
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
the
next
morning
for
her
hand
shook
quite
perceptibly
as
she
grasped
mine
and
her
voice
was
pitched
in
no
natural
key
as
she
inquired
how
i
had
slept
i
replied
as
truth
if
not
courtesy
demanded
as
well
as
usual
whereupon
her
eyes
fell
and
she
remarked
quite
hurriedly
am
so
sorry
you
shall
have
another
room
tonight
adding
in
what
appeared
to
be
an
unconscious
whisper
is
no
use
all
feel
it
even
the
young
and
the
gay
then
aloud
and
with
irrepressible
anxiety
did
see
anything
dear
i
protested
in
suddenly
awakened
dismay
the
strange
eyes
of
that
queer
drawing
peering
at
me
through
the
curtains
of
my
bed
is
it
is
it
a
haunted
room
her
look
was
a
shocked
one
her
protest
quite
vehement
no
no
one
has
ever
witnessed
anything
like
a
ghost
there
but
every
one
finds
it
impossible
to
sleep
in
that
bed
or
even
in
the
room
i
do
not
know
why
unless
it
is
that
my
father
spent
so
many
weary
years
of
incessant
wakefulness
inside
its
walls
did
he
die
in
that
bed
i
asked
she
gave
a
startled
shiver
and
drew
me
hurriedly
downstairs
as
we
paused
at
the
foot
she
pressed
my
hand
and
whispered
at
night
with
the
full
of
the
moon
upon
him
i
answered
her
look
with
one
she
probably
understood
as
little
as
i
did
hers
i
had
heard
of
this
father
of
hers
he
had
been
a
terrible
old
man
and
had
left
a
terrible
memory
behind
him
the
next
day
my
room
was
changed
according
to
her
promise
but
in
the
light
of
the
charges
i
have
since
heard
uttered
against
that
house
and
the
family
who
inhabit
it
i
am
glad
that
i
spent
one
night
in
what
if
it
was
not
a
haunted
chamber
had
certainly
a
very
thrilling
effect
upon
its
occupants
second
passage
the
italics
showing
where
it
was
most
heavily
marked
the
house
contained
another
room
as
interesting
as
the
one
i
have
already
mentioned
it
went
by
the
name
of
the
library
and
its
walls
were
heavily
lined
with
books
but
the
family
never
sat
there
nor
was
i
ever
fortunate
enough
to
see
it
with
its
doors
unclosed
except
on
the
occasion
of
the
grand
reception
mistress
callista
gave
in
my
honor
i
have
a
fancy
for
big
rooms
and
more
than
once
urged
my
hostess
to
tell
me
why
this
one
stood
neglected
but
the
lady
was
not
communicative
on
this
topic
and
it
was
from
another
member
of
the
household
i
learned
that
its
precincts
had
been
forever
clouded
by
the
unexpected
death
within
them
of
one
of
her
father
friends
a
noted
army
officer
why
this
should
have
occasioned
a
permanent
disuse
of
the
spot
i
could
not
understand
and
as
every
one
who
conversed
on
this
topic
invariably
gave
the
impression
of
saying
less
than
the
subject
demanded
my
curiosity
soon
became
too
much
for
me
and
i
attacked
miss
callista
once
again
in
regard
to
it
she
gave
me
a
quick
smile
for
she
was
always
amiable
but
shook
her
head
and
introduced
another
topic
but
one
night
when
the
wind
was
howling
in
the
chimneys
and
the
sense
of
loneliness
was
even
greater
than
usual
in
the
great
house
we
drew
together
on
the
rug
in
front
of
my
bedroom
fire
and
as
the
embers
burned
down
to
ashes
before
us
miss
callista
became
more
communicative
her
heart
was
heavy
she
told
me
had
been
heavy
for
years
perhaps
some
ray
of
comfort
would
reach
her
if
she
took
a
friend
into
her
confidence
god
knew
that
she
needed
one
especially
on
nights
like
this
when
the
wind
woke
echoes
all
over
the
house
and
it
was
hard
to
tell
which
most
to
fear
the
sounds
which
came
from
no
one
knew
where
or
the
silence
which
settled
after
she
trembled
as
she
said
this
and
instinctively
drew
nearer
my
side
so
that
our
heads
almost
touched
over
the
flickering
flame
from
whose
heat
and
light
we
sought
courage
she
seemed
to
feel
grateful
for
this
contact
and
the
next
minute
flinging
all
her
scruples
to
the
wind
she
began
a
relation
of
events
which
more
or
less
answered
my
late
unwelcome
queries
the
death
in
the
library
about
which
her
most
perplexing
memory
hung
took
place
when
she
was
a
child
and
her
father
held
that
high
governmental
position
which
has
reflected
so
much
credit
upon
the
family
her
father
and
the
man
who
thus
perished
had
been
intimate
friends
they
had
fought
together
in
the
war
of
and
received
the
same
distinguishing
marks
of
presidential
approval
afterward
they
were
both
members
of
an
important
commission
which
brought
them
into
diplomatic
relations
with
england
it
was
while
serving
on
this
commission
that
the
sudden
break
occurred
which
ended
all
intimate
relations
between
them
and
created
a
change
in
her
father
that
was
equally
remarked
at
home
and
abroad
what
occasioned
this
break
no
one
knew
whether
his
great
ambition
had
received
some
check
through
the
jealousy
of
this
friend
a
supposition
which
did
not
seem
possible
as
he
rose
rapidly
after
this
or
on
account
of
other
causes
darkly
hinted
at
by
his
contemporaries
but
never
breaking
into
open
gossip
he
was
never
the
same
man
afterwards
his
children
who
used
to
rush
with
effusion
to
greet
him
now
shrank
into
corners
at
his
step
or
slid
behind
half
open
doors
whence
they
peered
with
fearful
interest
at
his
tall
figure
pacing
in
moody
silence
the
halls
of
his
ancestral
home
or
sitting
with
frowning
brows
over
the
embers
dying
away
on
the
great
hearthstone
of
his
famous
library
their
mother
who
was
an
invalid
did
not
share
these
terrors
the
father
was
ever
tender
of
her
and
the
only
smile
they
ever
saw
on
his
face
came
with
his
entrance
into
her
darkened
room
such
were
callista
moore
first
memories
those
which
followed
were
more
definite
and
much
more
startling
president
jackson
who
had
a
high
opinion
of
her
father
ability
advanced
him
rapidly
finally
a
position
was
given
him
which
raised
him
into
national
prominence
as
this
had
been
the
goal
of
his
ambition
for
years
he
was
much
gratified
by
this
appointment
and
though
his
smiles
came
no
more
frequently
his
frowns
lightened
and
from
being
positively
threatening
became
simply
morose
why
this
moroseness
should
have
sharpened
into
menace
after
an
unexpected
visit
from
his
once
dear
but
long
estranged
his
daughter
even
after
long
years
of
constant
brooding
upon
this
subject
dares
not
decide
if
she
could
she
might
be
happier
the
general
was
a
kindly
man
sharp
of
face
and
of
a
tall
thin
figure
but
with
an
eye
to
draw
children
and
make
them
happy
with
a
look
but
his
effect
on
the
father
was
different
from
the
moment
the
two
met
in
the
great
hall
below
the
temper
of
the
host
betrayed
how
little
he
welcomed
this
guest
he
did
not
fail
in
courtesy
the
moores
are
always
gentlemen
but
it
was
a
hard
courtesy
which
cut
while
it
flattered
the
two
children
shrinking
from
its
edge
without
knowing
what
it
was
that
hurt
them
slunk
to
covert
and
from
behind
the
two
pillars
which
mark
the
entrance
to
the
library
watched
the
two
men
as
they
walked
up
and
down
the
halls
discussing
the
merits
of
this
and
that
detail
of
the
freshly
furnished
mansion
these
two
innocent
but
eager
spies
whom
fear
rather
than
curiosity
held
in
hiding
even
caught
some
of
the
sentences
which
passed
between
tire
friends
and
though
these
necessarily
conveyed
but
little
meaning
to
their
childish
minds
the
words
forming
them
were
never
forgotten
as
witness
these
phrases
confided
to
me
by
mistress
callista
years
afterward
have
much
that
most
men
lack
remarked
the
general
as
they
paused
to
admire
some
little
specimen
of
italian
art
which
had
been
lately
received
from
genoa
have
money
too
much
money
moore
by
an
amount
i
might
easily
name
a
home
which
some
might
call
palatial
a
lovely
if
not
altogether
healthy
wife
two
fine
children
and
all
the
honor
which
a
man
in
a
commonwealth
like
this
should
ask
for
drop
politics
are
my
life
was
the
cold
response
bid
me
drop
them
is
to
bid
me
commit
suicide
then
as
an
afterthought
to
which
a
moment
of
intervening
silence
added
emphasis
for
you
to
drive
me
from
them
would
be
an
act
little
short
of
murder
dealt
upon
a
traitor
is
not
murder
was
the
stern
and
unyielding
reply
one
black
deed
of
treacherous
barter
and
sale
of
which
none
of
your
countrymen
is
cognizant
but
myself
you
have
forfeited
the
confidence
of
this
government
were
i
who
so
unhappily
surprised
your
secret
to
allow
you
to
continue
in
your
present
place
of
trust
i
myself
would
be
a
traitor
to
the
republic
for
which
i
have
fought
and
for
which
i
am
ready
to
die
that
is
why
i
ask
you
to
resign
before
the
two
children
did
not
catch
the
threat
latent
in
that
last
word
but
they
realized
the
force
of
it
from
their
father
look
and
were
surprised
when
he
quietly
said
declare
yourself
to
be
the
only
man
on
the
commission
who
is
acquainted
with
the
facts
you
are
pleased
to
style
traitorous
the
general
lips
curled
i
not
said
he
asked
something
in
this
stern
honesty
seemed
to
affect
the
father
his
face
turned
away
and
it
was
the
other
voice
which
was
next
heard
a
change
had
taken
place
in
it
and
it
sounded
almost
mellow
as
it
gave
form
to
these
words
we
have
been
friends
you
shall
have
two
weeks
in
which
to
think
over
my
demand
and
decide
if
at
the
end
of
that
time
you
have
not
returned
to
domestic
life
you
may
expect
another
visit
from
me
which
can
not
fail
of
consequences
you
know
my
temper
when
roused
do
not
force
me
into
a
position
which
will
cause
us
both
endless
regret
perhaps
the
father
answered
perhaps
he
did
not
the
children
heard
nothing
further
but
they
witnessed
the
gloom
with
which
he
rode
away
to
the
white
house
the
next
day
remembering
the
threat
they
imagined
in
their
childish
hearts
that
their
father
had
gone
to
give
up
his
post
and
newly
acquired
honors
but
he
returned
at
night
without
having
done
so
and
from
that
day
on
carried
his
head
higher
and
showed
himself
more
and
more
the
master
both
at
home
and
abroad
but
he
was
restless
very
restless
and
possibly
to
allay
a
great
mental
uneasiness
he
began
having
some
changes
made
in
the
house
changes
which
occupied
much
of
his
time
and
with
which
he
never
seemed
satisfied
men
working
one
day
were
dismissed
the
next
and
others
called
in
until
this
work
and
everything
else
was
interrupted
by
the
return
of
his
late
unwelcome
guest
who
kept
his
appointment
to
a
day
at
this
point
in
her
narrative
mistress
callista
voice
fell
and
the
flame
which
had
thrown
a
partial
light
on
her
countenance
died
down
until
i
could
but
faintly
discern
the
secretly
inquiring
look
with
which
she
watched
me
as
she
went
on
to
say
and
i
reuben
was
her
brother
posted
in
the
dark
corner
under
the
stairs
when
my
father
met
the
general
at
the
door
we
had
expected
to
hear
high
words
or
some
explosion
of
bitter
feeling
between
them
and
hardly
knew
whether
to
be
glad
or
sorry
when
our
father
welcomed
his
guest
with
the
same
elaborate
bow
we
once
saw
him
make
to
the
president
in
the
grounds
of
the
white
house
nor
could
we
understand
what
followed
we
were
summoned
in
to
supper
our
mother
was
there
a
great
event
in
those
days
and
toasts
were
drunk
and
our
father
proposed
one
to
the
general
health
this
reuben
thought
was
an
open
signal
of
peace
and
turned
upon
me
his
great
round
eyes
in
surprise
but
i
who
was
old
enough
to
notice
that
this
toast
was
not
responded
to
and
that
the
general
did
not
even
touch
his
lips
to
the
glass
he
had
lifted
in
compliment
to
our
mother
who
had
lifted
hers
felt
that
there
was
something
terrifying
rather
than
reassuring
in
this
attempt
at
good
fellowship
though
unable
to
reason
over
it
at
the
time
i
have
often
done
so
since
and
my
father
attitude
and
look
as
he
faced
this
strange
guest
has
dwelt
so
persistently
in
my
memory
that
scarcely
a
year
passes
without
the
scene
coming
up
in
my
dreams
with
its
accompanying
emotions
of
fear
and
perplexity
for
perhaps
you
know
the
story
that
hour
was
the
general
last
he
died
before
leaving
the
house
died
in
that
same
dark
library
concerning
which
you
have
asked
so
many
questions
remember
the
circumstances
well
how
well
down
to
each
and
every
detail
our
mother
had
gone
back
to
her
room
and
the
general
and
my
father
who
did
not
linger
over
their
wine
why
should
they
when
the
general
would
not
drink
had
withdrawn
to
the
library
at
the
suggestion
of
the
general
whose
last
words
are
yet
lingering
in
my
ears
time
has
come
for
our
little
talk
said
he
reception
augurs
do
not
look
well
my
father
here
broke
in
in
what
seemed
an
unnaturally
loud
voice
and
sit
down
the
door
closed
had
hung
about
this
door
curious
children
that
we
were
in
hopes
of
catching
a
glimpse
of
the
queer
new
settle
which
had
been
put
into
place
that
day
but
we
scampered
away
at
this
and
were
playing
in
and
out
of
the
halls
when
the
library
door
again
opened
and
my
father
came
out
samba
he
cried
him
to
carry
a
glass
of
wine
in
to
the
general
i
do
not
like
his
looks
i
am
going
upstairs
for
some
medicine
this
he
whispered
in
choked
tones
as
he
set
foot
on
the
stairs
why
i
remember
it
i
do
not
know
for
reuben
who
was
standing
where
he
could
look
into
the
library
when
our
father
came
out
and
saw
the
settle
and
the
general
sitting
at
one
end
of
it
was
chattering
about
it
in
my
ear
at
the
very
moment
our
father
was
giving
his
orders
is
a
man
now
and
i
have
asked
him
more
than
once
since
then
how
the
general
looked
at
that
critical
instant
it
is
important
to
me
very
very
important
and
to
him
too
now
that
he
has
come
to
know
a
man
passions
and
temptations
but
he
will
never
tell
me
never
relieve
my
mind
and
i
can
only
hope
that
there
were
real
signs
of
illness
on
the
general
brow
for
then
i
could
feel
that
all
had
been
right
and
that
his
death
was
the
natural
result
of
the
great
distress
he
felt
at
opposing
my
father
in
the
one
desire
of
his
heart
that
glimpse
which
reuben
had
of
him
before
he
fell
has
always
struck
me
with
strange
pathos
a
little
child
looking
in
upon
a
man
who
for
all
his
apparent
health
will
in
another
moment
be
in
eternity
i
do
not
wonder
he
does
not
like
to
talk
of
it
and
yet
was
samba
who
came
upon
the
general
first
our
father
had
not
yet
descended
when
he
did
it
was
with
loud
cries
and
piteous
ejaculations
word
had
gone
upstairs
and
surprised
him
in
the
room
with
my
mother
i
recollect
wondering
in
all
childish
simplicity
why
he
wrung
his
hands
so
over
the
death
of
a
man
he
so
hated
and
feared
nor
was
it
till
years
had
passed
and
our
mother
had
been
laid
in
the
grave
and
the
house
had
settled
into
a
gloom
too
heavy
and
somber
for
reuben
to
endure
that
i
recognized
in
my
father
the
signs
of
a
settled
remorse
these
i
endeavored
to
account
for
by
the
fact
that
he
had
been
saved
from
what
he
looked
upon
as
political
death
by
the
sudden
but
opportune
decease
of
his
best
friend
this
caused
a
shock
to
his
feelings
which
had
unnerved
him
for
life
do
you
think
this
the
true
explanation
of
his
invariably
moody
brow
and
the
great
distaste
he
always
showed
for
this
same
library
though
he
would
live
in
no
other
house
he
would
not
enter
that
room
nor
look
at
the
gloomy
settle
from
which
the
general
had
fallen
to
his
death
the
place
was
virtually
tabooed
and
though
as
the
necessity
arose
it
was
opened
from
time
to
time
for
great
festivities
the
shadow
it
had
acquired
never
left
it
and
my
father
hated
its
very
door
until
he
died
is
it
not
natural
that
his
daughter
should
share
this
feeling
it
was
and
i
said
so
but
i
would
say
no
more
though
she
cast
me
little
appealing
looks
which
acquired
an
eery
significance
from
the
pressure
of
her
small
fingers
on
my
arm
and
the
wailing
sound
of
the
wind
which
at
that
moment
blew
down
in
one
gust
scattering
the
embers
and
filling
the
house
with
banshee
calls
i
simply
kissed
her
and
advised
her
to
go
back
with
me
to
england
and
forget
this
old
house
and
all
its
miserable
memories
for
that
was
the
sum
of
the
comfort
at
my
poor
command
when
after
another
restless
night
i
crept
down
in
the
early
morning
to
peer
into
the
dim
and
unused
room
whose
story
i
had
at
last
learned
i
can
not
say
but
that
i
half
expected
to
behold
the
meager
ghost
of
the
unfortunate
general
rise
from
the
cushions
of
the
prodigious
bench
which
still
kept
its
mysterious
watch
over
the
deserted
hearthstone
so
much
for
the
passages
culled
from
the
book
itself
the
newspaper
excerpts
to
which
i
next
turned
bore
a
much
later
date
and
read
as
follows
a
strange
coincidence
marks
the
death
of
albert
moore
in
his
brother
house
yesterday
he
was
discovered
lying
with
his
head
on
the
identical
spot
where
general
lloyd
fell
forty
years
before
it
is
said
that
this
sudden
demise
of
a
man
hitherto
regarded
as
a
model
of
physical
strength
and
endurance
was
preceded
by
a
violent
altercation
with
his
elder
brother
if
this
is
so
the
excitement
incident
upon
such
a
break
in
their
usually
pleasant
relations
may
account
for
his
sudden
death
edward
moore
who
unfortunately
was
out
of
the
room
when
his
brother
succumbed
some
say
that
he
was
in
his
grandfather
room
above
was
greatly
unnerved
by
this
unexpected
end
to
what
was
probably
merely
a
temporary
quarrel
and
now
lies
in
a
critical
condition
the
relations
between
him
and
the
deceased
albert
have
always
been
of
the
most
amicable
character
until
they
unfortunately
fell
in
love
with
the
same
woman
attached
to
this
was
another
slip
apparently
from
a
later
paper
the
quarrel
between
the
two
brothers
moore
just
prior
to
the
younger
one
death
turns
out
to
have
been
of
a
more
serious
nature
than
was
first
supposed
it
has
since
leaked
out
that
an
actual
duel
was
fought
at
that
time
between
these
two
on
the
floor
of
the
old
library
and
that
in
this
duel
the
elder
one
was
wounded
some
even
go
so
far
as
to
affirm
that
the
lady
hand
was
to
be
the
reward
of
him
who
drew
the
first
blood
it
is
no
longer
denied
that
the
room
was
in
great
disorder
when
the
servants
first
rushed
in
at
the
sound
he
made
in
falling
everything
movable
had
been
pushed
back
against
the
wall
and
an
open
space
cleared
in
the
center
of
which
could
be
seen
one
drop
of
blood
what
is
certain
is
that
moore
is
held
to
the
house
by
something
even
more
serious
than
his
deep
grief
and
that
the
young
lady
who
was
the
object
of
this
fatal
dispute
has
left
the
city
pasted
under
this
was
the
following
short
announcement
married
on
the
of
january
at
the
american
consulate
in
rome
italy
edward
moore
of
washington
united
states
of
america
to
antoinette
sloan
daughter
of
joseph
dewitt
sloan
also
of
that
city
with
this
notice
my
interest
in
the
book
ceased
and
i
prepared
to
step
down
from
the
chair
on
which
i
had
remained
standing
during
the
reading
of
the
above
passages
as
i
did
so
i
spied
a
slip
of
paper
lying
on
the
floor
at
my
feet
as
it
had
not
been
there
ten
minutes
before
there
could
be
little
doubt
that
it
had
slipped
from
the
book
whose
leaves
i
had
been
turning
over
so
rapidly
hastening
to
recover
it
i
found
it
to
be
a
sheet
of
ordinary
note
paper
partly
inscribed
with
words
in
a
neat
and
distinctive
handwriting
this
was
a
great
find
for
the
paper
was
fresh
and
the
handwriting
one
which
could
be
readily
identified
what
i
saw
written
there
was
still
more
remarkable
it
had
the
look
of
some
of
the
memoranda
i
had
myself
drawn
up
during
the
most
perplexing
moments
of
this
strange
case
i
transcribe
it
just
as
it
read
we
have
here
two
separate
accounts
of
how
death
comes
to
those
who
breathe
their
last
on
the
ancestral
hearthstone
of
the
moore
house
library
certain
facts
are
emphasized
in
both
each
victim
was
alone
when
he
fell
each
death
was
preceded
by
a
scene
of
altercation
or
violent
controversy
between
the
victim
and
the
alleged
master
of
these
premises
in
each
case
the
master
of
the
house
reaped
some
benefit
real
or
fancied
from
the
other
death

curious
set

some
one
besides
myself
was
searching
for
the
very
explanation
i
was
at
that
moment
intent
upon
i
should
have
considered
it
the
work
of
our
detectives
if
the
additional
lines
i
now
came
upon
could
have
been
written
by
any
one
but
a
moore
but
no
one
of
any
other
blood
or
associations
could
have
indited
the
amazing
words
which
followed
the
only
excuse
i
could
find
for
them
was
the
difficulty
which
some
men
feel
in
formulating
their
thoughts
otherwise
than
with
pen
and
paper
they
were
so
evidently
intended
for
the
writer
eye
and
understanding
only
as
witness
let
me
recall
the
words
my
father
was
uttering
when
my
brother
rushed
in
upon
us
with
that
account
of
my
misdeeds
which
changed
all
my
prospects
in
life
it
was
my
birthday
and
the
old
man
had
just
informed
me
that
as
the
eldest
son
i
might
expect
the
house
in
which
we
stood
to
be
mine
one
day
and
with
it
a
secret
which
has
been
handed
down
from
father
to
son
ever
since
the
moores
rose
to
eminence
in
the
person
of
colonel
alpheus
then
he
noted
that
i
was
now
of
age
and
immediately
went
on
to
say
means
that
you
must
be
told
certain
facts
without
the
knowledge
of
which
you
would
be
no
true
moore
these
facts
you
must
hereafter
relate
to
your
son
or
whoever
may
be
fortunate
enough
to
inherit
from
you
it
is
the
legacy
which
goes
with
this
house
and
one
which
no
inheritor
as
yet
has
refused
either
to
receive
or
to
transmit
listen
you
have
often
noted
the
gold
filigree
ball
which
i
wear
on
my
this
ball
is
the
talisman
of
our
house
of
this
house
if
in
the
course
of
your
life
you
find
yourself
in
an
extremity
from
which
no
issue
seems
possible
mind
the
strictness
of
the
injunction
an
extremity
from
which
no
issue
seems
possible
i
have
never
been
in
such
a
case
the
gold
filigree
ball
has
never
been
opened
by
me
you
will
take
this
trinket
from
its
chain
press
upon
this
portion
of
it
so
and
use
what
you
will
find
inside
in
connection
with
alas
it
was
at
this
point
john
judson
came
rushing
in
and
those
disclosures
were
made
which
lost
me
my
regard
and
gave
to
the
informer
my
rightful
inheritance
together
with
the
full
secret
of
which
i
only
got
a
part
but
that
part
must
help
me
now
to
the
whole
i
have
seen
the
filigree
ball
many
times
veronica
has
it
now
but
its
contents
have
never
been
shown
me
if
i
knew
what
they
were
and
why
the
master
of
this
secret
always
left
the
library
here
the
memorandum
ceased
with
a
long
line
straggling
from
the
letter
y
as
if
the
writer
had
been
surprised
at
his
task
the
effect
upon
me
of
these
remarkable
words
was
to
heighten
my
interest
and
raise
me
into
a
state
of
renewed
hope
if
not
of
active
expectation
another
mind
than
my
own
had
been
at
work
along
the
only
groove
which
held
out
any
promise
of
success
and
this
mind
having
at
its
command
certain
family
traditions
had
let
me
into
a
most
valuable
secret
another
mind
whose
mind
that
was
a
question
easily
answered
but
one
man
could
have
written
these
words
the
man
who
was
thrust
aside
in
early
life
in
favor
of
his
younger
brother
and
who
now
by
the
sudden
death
of
that
daughter
had
come
again
into
his
inheritance
uncle
david
and
he
only
was
the
puzzled
inquirer
whose
i
had
just
read
this
fact
raised
a
new
problem
far
me
to
work
upon
and
i
could
but
ask
when
these
lines
were
written
before
or
after
pfeiffer
death
and
whether
he
had
ever
succeeded
in
solving
the
riddle
he
had
suggested
or
whether
it
was
still
a
baffling
mystery
to
him
i
was
so
moved
by
the
suggestion
conveyed
in
his
final
and
sentence
that
i
soon
lost
sight
of
these
lesser
inquiries
in
the
more
important
one
connected
with
the
filigree
ball
for
i
had
seen
this
filigree
ball
i
had
even
handled
it
from
the
description
given
i
was
very
certain
that
it
had
been
one
of
the
many
trinkets
i
had
observed
lying
on
the
dressing
table
when
i
made
my
first
hasty
examination
of
the
room
on
the
evening
of
jeffrey
death
why
had
no
premonition
of
its
importance
as
a
connecting
link
between
these
tragedies
and
their
mysterious
cause
come
to
me
at
the
time
when
it
was
within
reach
of
my
hand
it
was
too
late
now
it
had
been
swept
away
with
the
other
loose
objects
littering
the
place
and
my
opportunity
for
pursuing
this
very
promising
investigation
was
gone
for
the
night
yet
it
was
with
a
decided
feeling
of
triumph
that
i
finally
locked
the
door
of
this
old
mansion
behind
me
certainly
i
had
taken
a
step
forward
since
my
entrance
there
to
which
i
had
but
to
add
another
of
equal
importance
to
merit
the
attention
of
the
superintendent
himself
xxi
the
heart
of
the
puzzle
the
next
morning
i
swallowed
my
pride
and
sought
out
durbin
he
had
superintended
the
removal
of
jeffrey
effects
from
the
southwest
chamber
and
should
know
if
any
one
where
this
filigree
ball
was
now
to
be
found
doubtless
it
had
been
returned
with
the
other
things
to
jeffrey
and
yet
who
knows
durbin
is
sly
and
some
inkling
of
its
value
as
a
clue
may
have
entered
his
mind
if
so
it
would
be
anywhere
but
in
jeffrey
or
miss
possession
to
test
my
rival
knowledge
of
and
interest
in
this
seemingly
trivial
object
i
stooped
to
what
i
can
but
consider
a
pardonable
subterfuge
greeting
him
in
the
offhand
way
least
likely
to
develop
his
suspicion
i
told
him
that
i
had
a
great
idea
in
connection
with
the
jeffrey
case
and
that
the
clue
to
it
lay
in
a
little
gold
ball
which
jeffrey
sometimes
wore
and
upon
which
she
set
great
store
so
far
i
spoke
the
truth
it
had
been
given
her
by
some
one
not
jeffrey
and
i
believed
though
i
did
not
know
that
it
contained
a
miniature
portrait
which
it
might
be
to
our
advantage
to
see
i
expected
his
lip
to
curl
but
for
a
wonder
it
maintained
its
noncommittal
aspect
though
i
was
sure
that
i
caught
a
slight
very
slight
gleam
of
curiosity
lighting
up
for
a
moment
his
calm
gray
eye
you
are
on
a
fantastic
trail
he
sneered
and
that
was
all
but
i
had
not
expected
more
i
had
merely
wished
to
learn
what
place
if
any
this
filigree
ball
held
in
his
own
suspicions
and
in
case
he
had
overlooked
it
to
jog
his
curiosity
so
that
he
would
in
some
way
betray
its
whereabouts
that
for
all
its
seeming
inconsequence
it
did
hold
some
place
in
his
mind
was
evident
enough
to
those
who
knew
him
but
that
it
was
within
reach
or
obtainable
by
any
ordinary
means
was
not
so
plain
indeed
i
very
soon
became
convinced
that
he
for
one
had
no
idea
where
it
was
or
after
the
suggestive
hint
i
had
given
him
he
would
never
have
wasted
a
on
me
what
was
i
to
do
then
tell
my
story
to
the
major
and
depend
on
him
to
push
the
matter
to
its
proper
conclusion
not
yet
whispered
pride
durbin
thinks
you
a
fool
wait
till
you
can
show
your
whole
hand
before
calling
attention
to
your
cards
but
it
was
hard
not
to
betray
my
excitement
and
to
act
the
fool
they
considered
me
when
the
boys
twitted
me
about
this
famous
golden
charm
and
asked
what
great
result
had
followed
my
night
in
the
moore
house
but
remembering
that
he
who
laughs
last
laughs
best
and
that
the
cause
of
mirth
was
not
yet
over
between
durbin
and
myself
i
was
able
to
preserve
an
impassive
exterior
even
when
i
came
under
the
major
eye
i
found
myself
amply
repaid
when
one
of
the
boys
who
had
studiously
avoided
chaffing
me
dropped
the
following
words
in
my
ear
i
do
know
what
your
interest
is
in
the
small
gold
charm
you
were
talking
about
but
you
have
done
some
good
work
in
this
case
and
i
do
mind
telling
you
what
i
know
about
it
that
little
gold
ball
has
caused
the
police
much
trouble
it
is
on
the
list
of
effects
found
in
the
room
where
the
candle
was
seen
burning
but
when
all
these
petty
belongings
of
jeffrey
were
gathered
up
and
carried
back
to
her
husband
this
special
one
was
not
to
be
found
amongst
them
it
was
lost
in
transit
nor
has
it
ever
been
seen
since
and
who
do
you
think
it
was
who
called
attention
to
this
loss
and
demanded
that
the
article
be
found
not
jeffrey
who
seems
to
lay
little
or
no
stress
upon
it
but
the
old
man
they
call
uncle
david
he
who
to
all
appearance
possessed
no
interest
in
his
niece
personal
property
was
on
hand
the
moment
these
things
were
carried
into
her
husband
house
with
the
express
intention
it
seems
of
inquiring
for
this
gold
ball
which
he
declared
to
be
a
family
heirloom
as
such
it
belonged
to
him
as
the
present
holder
of
the
property
and
to
him
only
attention
being
thus
called
to
it
it
was
found
to
be
missing
and
as
no
one
but
the
police
seemed
to
be
to
blame
for
its
loss
the
matter
was
hushed
up
and
would
have
been
regarded
as
too
insignificant
for
comment
the
trinket
being
intrinsically
worthless
if
moore
had
not
continued
to
make
such
a
fuss
about
it
this
ball
he
declared
was
worth
as
much
to
a
moore
as
all
the
rest
of
his
property
which
was
bosh
you
know
and
the
folly
of
these
assertions
and
the
depth
of
the
passions
he
displayed
whenever
the
subject
was
mentioned
have
made
some
of
us
question
if
he
is
the
innocent
inheritor
he
has
tried
to
make
himself
out
at
all
events
i
know
for
a
certainty
that
the
district
attorney
holds
his
name
in
reserve
if
the
grand
jury
fails
to
bring
in
an
indictment
against
miss
tuttle
the
district
attorney
is
wise
i
remarked
and
fell
athinking
had
this
latent
suspicion
against
moore
any
solid
foundation
was
he
the
guilty
man
the
memorandum
i
had
come
across
in
the
book
which
had
been
lately
pulled
down
from
the
library
shelves
showed
that
notwithstanding
his
testimony
to
the
contrary
he
had
been
in
that
house
close
upon
that
fatal
night
if
not
on
the
very
night
itself
it
also
showed
his
extreme
interest
in
the
traditions
of
the
family
but
did
it
show
anything
more
had
he
interrupted
his
writing
to
finish
his
query
in
blood
and
had
one
of
his
motives
for
this
crime
been
the
acquisition
of
this
filigree
ball
if
so
why
had
he
left
it
on
the
table
upstairs
a
candle
had
been
lit
in
that
room
could
it
have
been
by
him
in
his
search
for
this
object
it
would
be
a
great
relief
to
believe
so
what
was
the
reason
then
that
my
mind
refused
so
emphatically
to
grasp
this
possibility
and
settle
upon
him
as
the
murderer
of
jeffrey
i
can
not
tell
i
hated
the
man
and
i
likewise
deeply
distrusted
him
but
i
could
not
even
after
this
revelation
of
his
duplicity
connect
him
in
my
thoughts
with
absolute
crime
without
a
shock
to
my
intuitions
happily
my
scruples
were
not
shared
by
my
colleagues
they
had
listed
him
here
i
felt
my
shoulder
touched
and
a
newspaper
was
thrust
into
my
hand
by
the
man
who
had
just
addressed
me
look
down
the
lost
and
found
column
said
he
the
third
advertisement
you
will
see
there
came
from
the
district
office
the
next
one
was
inserted
by
moore
himself
i
followed
his
pointing
finer
and
read
two
descriptions
of
the
filigree
ball
the
disproportion
in
the
rewards
offered
was
apparent
that
promised
by
uncle
david
was
calculated
to
rouse
any
man
cupidity
and
should
have
resulted
in
the
immediate
return
he
got
ahead
of
the
police
that
time
i
laughed
when
did
these
advertisements
appear
during
the
days
you
were
absent
from
washington
and
how
sure
are
you
that
he
did
not
get
this
jewel
back
oh
we
are
sure
his
continued
anxiety
and
still
active
interest
prove
this
even
if
our
surveillance
had
been
less
perfect
and
the
police
have
been
equally
unsuccessful
equally
after
every
effort
every
who
was
the
man
who
collected
and
carried
out
those
things
from
the
southwest
chamber
he
smiled
you
see
him
said
he
it
was
you
myself
and
you
are
sure
this
small
ball
was
among
them
no
i
only
know
that
i
have
seen
it
somewhere
but
that
it
was
among
the
articles
i
delivered
to
mr
jeffrey
how
did
you
carry
them
in
a
which
i
locked
myself
before
leaving
the
southwest
chamber
yes
then
it
is
still
in
that
room
find
it
was
his
laconic
reply
here
most
men
would
have
stopped
but
i
have
a
bulldog
tenacity
when
once
i
lay
hold
that
night
i
went
back
to
the
moore
house
and
taking
every
precaution
against
being
surprised
by
the
sarcastic
durbin
or
some
of
his
many
flatterers
i
ransacked
the
southwest
chamber
on
my
own
behalf
for
what
certainly
i
had
little
reason
to
expect
to
find
there
it
seemed
a
hopeless
cause
from
the
first
but
i
acted
as
if
no
one
had
hunted
for
this
object
before
moving
every
article
i
sought
first
on
the
open
floor
and
then
in
every
possible
cranny
for
the
missing
trinket
but
i
failed
to
find
it
and
was
about
to
acknowledge
myself
defeated
when
my
eye
fell
on
the
long
brocaded
curtains
which
i
had
drawn
across
the
several
windows
to
hide
every
gleam
of
light
from
the
street
they
were
almost
free
from
folds
but
i
shook
them
well
especially
the
one
nearest
the
table
and
naturally
with
no
effect
folly
i
muttered
yet
did
not
quite
desist
for
the
great
tassels
still
hung
at
the
sides
and
well
you
may
call
it
an
impossible
find
or
say
that
if
the
bauble
was
there
it
should
have
been
discovered
in
the
first
search
for
it
i
will
not
say
no
i
can
only
tell
you
what
happened
when
i
took
one
of
those
tassels
in
my
band
i
thought
as
it
twirled
under
my
touch
that
i
saw
something
gleam
in
its
faded
old
threads
which
did
not
belong
there
startled
and
yet
not
thoroughly
realizing
that
i
had
come
upon
the
object
of
my
search
i
picked
at
this
thing
and
found
it
to
be
a
morsel
of
gold
chain
that
had
become
entangled
in
it
when
i
had
pulled
it
out
it
showed
a
small
golden
ball
at
one
end
filigreed
over
and
astonishingly
heavy
for
its
size
and
apparent
delicacy
how
it
came
there
whether
it
rolled
from
the
table
or
was
swept
off
inadvertently
by
the
detective
hand
and
how
it
came
to
be
caught
by
this
old
tassel
and
held
there
in
spite
of
the
many
shakings
it
must
have
received
did
not
concern
me
at
this
momentous
instant
the
talisman
of
this
old
family
was
found
i
had
but
to
discover
what
it
held
concealed
to
understand
what
had
baffled
moore
and
made
the
mystery
he
had
endeavored
to
penetrate
so
insolvable
rejoicing
in
my
triumph
but
not
wasting
a
moment
in
i
bent
over
the
candle
with
my
prize
and
sought
for
the
clasp
or
fastening
which
held
its
two
parts
together
i
have
a
knack
at
clasps
and
curious
fastenings
and
was
able
at
first
touch
to
spring
this
one
open
and
what
did
i
find
inside
something
so
different
from
what
i
expected
something
so
trivial
and
seemingly
harmless
that
it
was
not
until
i
recalled
the
final
words
of
uncle
david
memorandum
that
i
realized
its
full
import
and
the
possibilities
it
suggested
in
itself
it
was
nothing
but
a
minute
magnifying
glass
but
when
used
in
connection
with
what
ah
that
was
just
what
uncle
david
failed
to
say
possibly
to
know
yet
this
was
now
the
important
point
the
culminating
fact
which
might
lead
to
a
full
understanding
of
these
many
tragedies
could
i
hope
to
guess
what
presented
itself
to
moore
as
a
difficult
if
not
insolvable
problem
no
guessing
would
not
answer
i
must
trust
to
the
inspiration
of
the
moment
which
suggested
with
almost
irresistible
conviction
the
picture
that
inane
and
seemingly
worthless
drawing
over
the
fireplace
in
the
colonel
own
whose
presence
in
so
rich
a
room
has
always
been
a
mystery
why
this
object
should
have
suggested
itself
to
me
and
with
such
instant
conviction
i
can
not
readily
say
whether
from
my
position
near
the
bed
the
sight
of
this
old
drawing
recalled
the
restless
nights
of
all
who
had
lain
in
face
of
its
sickly
smile
or
whether
some
recollection
of
that
secret
law
of
the
moores
which
forbade
the
removal
of
any
of
their
pictures
from
the
walls
or
a
remembrance
of
the
curiosity
which
this
picture
excited
in
every
one
who
looked
at
it
francis
jeffrey
among
the
number
i
no
sooner
asked
myself
what
object
in
this
house
might
possibly
yield
counsel
or
suggest
aid
when
subjected
to
the
influence
of
a
magnifying
glass
than
the
answer
which
i
have
already
given
sprang
instantly
into
my
mind
the
picture
greatly
excited
i
sprang
upon
a
chair
took
down
the
drawing
from
the
wall
and
laid
it
face
up
on
the
bed
then
i
placed
the
glass
over
one
of
the
large
coils
surrounding
the
insipid
face
and
was
startled
enough
in
spite
of
all
mental
preparation
to
perceive
the
crinkly
lines
which
formed
it
resolve
themselves
into
script
and
the
script
into
words
some
of
which
were
perfectly
legible
the
drawing
simple
as
it
looked
was
a
communication
in
writing
to
those
who
used
a
magnifying
glass
to
read
it
i
could
hardly
contain
my
triumph
hardly
find
the
necessary
to
a
careful
study
of
its
undulating
and
often
conflicting
lines
and
to
the
slow
picking
out
of
the
words
therein
contained
but
when
i
had
done
this
and
had
copied
the
whole
of
the
wandering
scrawl
on
a
page
of
my
note
book
the
result
was
of
value
read
and
judge
for
yourself
coward
that
i
am
i
am
willing
to
throw
upon
posterity
the
shadow
of
a
crime
whose
consequences
i
dare
not
incur
in
life
confession
i
must
make
to
die
and
leave
no
record
of
my
deed
is
impossible
yet
how
tell
my
story
so
that
only
my
own
heirs
may
read
and
they
when
at
the
crisis
of
their
fate
i
believe
i
have
found
the
way
by
this
drawing
and
the
injunction
i
have
left
to
the
holders
of
the
filigree
ball
no
man
ever
wished
his
enemy
dead
more
than
i
did
and
no
man
ever
spent
more
cunning
on
the
deed
master
in
my
own
house
i
contrived
a
device
by
which
the
man
who
held
my
fate
in
his
hands
fell
on
my
library
hearth
with
no
one
near
and
no
sign
by
which
to
associate
me
with
the
act
does
this
seem
like
the
assertion
of
a
madman
go
to
the
old
chamber
familiarly
called
the
own
enter
its
closet
pull
out
its
two
drawers
and
in
the
opening
thus
made
seek
for
the
loophole
at
the
back
through
which
if
you
stoop
low
enough
you
can
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
library
hearth
and
its
great
settle
with
these
in
view
slip
your
finger
along
the
wall
on
your
right
and
when
it
touches
an
obstruction
pass
it
if
it
is
a
handle
for
that
is
only
used
to
rewind
the
apparatus
and
must
be
turned
from
you
until
it
can
be
turned
no
farther
but
if
it
is
a
depression
you
encounter
press
and
press
hard
on
the
knob
concealed
within
it
but
beware
when
any
one
you
love
is
seated
in
that
corner
of
the
settle
where
the
cushion
invites
rest
lest
it
be
your
fate
to
mourn
and
wail
as
it
is
mine
to
curse
the
hour
when
i
sought
to
clear
my
way
by
murder
for
the
doom
of
the
man
of
blood
is
upon
me
the
hindrance
is
gone
from
my
life
but
a
horror
has
entered
it
beyond
the
conception
of
any
soul
that
has
not
yielded
itself
to
the
unimaginable
influences
emanating
from
an
accomplished
crime
i
can
not
be
content
with
having
pressed
that
spring
once
a
mania
is
upon
me
which
after
thirty
years
of
useless
resistance
and
superhuman
struggle
still
draws
me
from
bed
and
sleep
to
rehearse
in
ghastly
fashion
that
deed
of
my
early
manhood
i
can
not
resist
it
to
tear
out
the
deadly
mechanism
unhinge
weight
and
drum
and
rid
the
house
of
every
evidence
of
crime
would
but
drive
me
to
shriek
my
guilt
aloud
and
act
in
open
pantomime
what
i
now
go
through
in
fearsome
silence
and
secrecy
when
the
hour
comes
as
come
it
must
that
i
can
not
rise
and
enter
that
fatal
closet
i
shall
still
enact
the
deed
in
dreams
and
shriek
aloud
in
my
sleep
and
wish
myself
dead
and
yet
fear
to
die
lest
my
hell
be
to
go
through
all
eternity
slaying
over
and
over
my
man
in
ever
growing
horror
and
repulsion
do
you
wish
to
share
my
fate
try
to
effect
through
blood
a
release
from
the
difficulties
menacing
you
xxii
a
thread
in
hand
there
are
moments
which
stand
out
with
intense
force
and
clearness
in
every
man
life
mine
was
the
one
which
followed
the
reading
of
these
lines
which
were
meant
for
a
warning
but
which
in
more
than
one
case
had
manifestly
served
to
open
the
way
to
a
repetition
of
the
very
crime
they
deplored
i
felt
myself
under
the
same
fascination
i
wanted
to
test
the
mechanism
to
follow
out
then
and
there
the
instructions
given
with
such
shortsighted
minuteness
and
mark
the
result
but
a
sense
of
decorum
prevented
it
was
clearly
my
duty
to
carry
so
important
a
discovery
as
this
to
the
major
and
subject
myself
to
his
commands
before
making
the
experiment
suggested
by
the
scroll
i
had
so
carefully
deciphered
besides
it
would
be
difficult
to
carry
out
this
experiment
alone
and
with
no
other
light
than
that
afforded
by
my
lantern
another
man
and
more
lights
were
needed
influenced
by
these
considerations
i
restored
the
picture
to
its
place
and
left
the
building
as
i
did
so
the
first
signs
of
dawn
became
visible
in
the
east
i
had
expended
three
hours
in
picking
out
the
meaning
concealed
in
the
wavy
lines
of
the
old
picture
i
was
early
at
headquarters
that
morning
but
not
so
early
as
to
find
the
superintendent
alone
a
group
of
men
were
already
congregated
about
him
in
his
small
office
and
when
on
being
admitted
i
saw
amongst
them
the
district
attorney
durbin
and
another
famous
detective
i
instinctively
knew
what
matter
was
under
discussion
i
was
allowed
to
remain
possibly
because
i
brought
news
in
my
face
possibly
because
the
major
felt
more
kindly
toward
me
than
i
thought
though
durbin
who
had
been
speaking
had
at
first
sight
of
me
shut
his
mouth
like
a
trap
and
even
went
so
far
as
to
drum
an
impatient
protest
with
his
fingers
on
the
table
before
which
he
stood
neither
the
major
nor
the
district
attorney
turned
an
unkindly
face
toward
me
and
my
amiable
friend
was
obliged
to
accept
my
presence
with
what
grace
he
could
there
was
with
them
a
fourth
man
who
stood
apart
on
him
the
general
attention
had
been
concentrated
at
my
entrance
and
to
him
it
now
returned
he
was
an
unpretentious
person
of
kindly
aspect
to
any
one
accustomed
to
washington
residents
he
bore
the
unmistakable
signs
of
being
one
of
the
many
departmental
employees
whose
pay
is
inadequate
to
the
necessities
of
his
family
of
his
personal
peculiarities
i
noted
two
he
blinked
when
he
talked
and
stuttered
painfully
when
excited
notwithstanding
these
defects
he
made
a
good
impression
and
commanded
confidence
this
i
soon
saw
was
of
importance
for
the
story
he
now
entered
upon
was
one
calculated
to
make
me
forget
my
own
errand
and
even
to
question
my
own
convictions
the
first
intimation
i
received
of
the
curious
nature
of
his
communication
was
through
the
following
questions
put
to
him
by
the
major
you
are
sure
this
gentleman
is
identical
with
the
one
pointed
out
to
you
last
night
very
sure
sir
i
can
swear
to
it
i
omit
all
evidence
of
the
defect
in
his
speech
above
mentioned
you
recognize
him
positively
positively
i
should
have
picked
him
out
with
the
same
assurance
if
i
had
seen
him
in
some
other
city
and
in
a
crowd
of
as
gentlemen
as
himself
his
face
made
a
great
impression
on
me
you
see
i
had
ample
time
to
study
it
in
the
few
minutes
we
stood
so
close
together
so
you
have
said
will
you
be
kind
enough
to
repeat
the
circumstance
i
should
like
the
man
who
has
just
come
in
to
hear
your
description
of
this
scene
give
the
action
please
it
is
all
very
interesting
the
stranger
glanced
inquisitively
in
my
direction
and
turned
to
obey
the
superintendent
i
was
returning
to
my
home
in
georgetown
on
the
evening
of
may
the
eleventh
the
day
of
the
great
tragedy
my
wife
was
ill
and
i
had
been
into
town
to
see
a
physician
and
should
have
gone
directly
home
but
i
was
curious
to
see
how
high
the
flood
was
running
you
remember
it
was
over
the
banks
that
night
so
i
wandered
out
on
the
bridge
and
came
upon
the
gentleman
about
whom
you
have
been
questioning
me
he
was
standing
all
alone
leaning
on
the
rail
thus
here
the
speaker
drew
up
a
chair
and
crossing
his
arms
over
its
back
bent
his
head
down
over
them
i
did
not
know
him
but
the
way
he
eyed
the
water
leaping
and
boiling
in
a
yellow
flood
beneath
was
not
the
way
of
a
curious
man
like
myself
but
of
one
who
was
meditating
some
desperate
deed
he
was
handsome
and
well
dressed
but
he
looked
a
miserable
wretch
and
was
in
a
state
of
such
complete
that
he
did
not
notice
me
though
i
had
stopped
not
five
feet
from
his
side
i
expected
to
see
him
throw
himself
over
but
instead
of
that
he
suddenly
raised
his
head
and
gazing
straight
before
him
not
at
the
heavy
current
but
at
some
vision
in
his
own
mind
broke
forth
in
these
words
spoken
as
i
had
never
heard
words
spoken
before
here
the
speaker
stuttering
got
the
better
of
him
and
the
district
attorney
had
time
to
say
what
were
these
words
speak
them
slowly
we
have
all
the
time
there
is
instantly
the
man
plucked
up
heart
and
eying
us
all
impressively
was
able
to
say
they
were
these
must
die
she
must
die
no
name
but
just
the
one
phrase
twice
repeated
must
die
this
startled
me
and
hardly
knowing
whether
to
lay
hands
on
him
or
to
turn
about
and
run
i
was
moving
slowly
away
when
he
drew
his
arms
from
the
rail
like
this
and
still
staring
into
space
added
in
the
same
hard
and
determined
voice
this
one
word
more
and
wheeling
about
passed
me
with
one
blank
and
wholly
unconscious
look
and
betook
himself
toward
the
city
as
he
went
by
his
lips
opened
for
the
third
time
means
he
cried
between
a
groan
and
a
shriek
bullet
for
her
and
i
wish
i
had
heard
the
rest
but
he
was
out
of
my
hearing
before
his
sentence
was
finished
what
time
was
this
as
near
five
as
possible
it
was
six
when
i
reached
home
a
few
minutes
later
ah
he
must
have
gone
to
the
cemetery
after
this
i
am
quite
sure
of
it
why
did
you
follow
the
man
grumbled
durbin
it
was
my
business
he
was
a
stranger
and
possibly
mad
i
did
know
what
to
do
what
did
you
do
went
home
and
kept
quiet
my
wife
was
very
ill
that
night
and
i
had
my
own
cause
for
anxiety
you
however
read
the
papers
next
morning
no
sir
nor
for
many
days
my
wife
grew
constantly
worse
and
for
a
week
i
did
leave
her
not
knowing
but
that
every
breath
would
be
her
last
i
was
dead
to
everything
outside
the
and
when
she
grew
better
which
was
very
gradually
we
had
to
take
her
away
so
that
i
had
no
opportunity
of
speaking
of
this
occurrence
to
any
one
till
a
week
ago
when
some
remark
published
in
connection
with
jeffrey
death
recalled
that
encounter
on
the
bridge
i
told
a
neighbor
that
i
believed
the
man
i
had
seen
there
was
jeffrey
and
we
looked
up
the
papers
and
ran
over
them
till
we
came
upon
his
picture
that
settled
it
and
i
could
no
longer
being
free
from
home
anxieties
now
hold
my
tongue
and
the
police
heard
that
will
do
gelston
broke
in
the
major
when
we
want
you
again
we
will
let
you
know
durbin
see
gelston
out
i
was
left
alone
with
the
major
and
the
district
attorney
there
was
a
moment
silence
during
which
my
own
heart
beat
so
loud
that
i
was
afraid
they
would
hear
it
since
taking
up
miss
tuttle
cause
i
had
never
really
believed
in
innocence
in
spite
of
the
alibi
he
had
brought
forward
and
now
i
expected
to
hear
these
men
utter
the
same
conviction
the
major
was
the
first
to
speak
addressing
the
district
attorney
he
remarked
this
will
strengthen
your
case
very
materially
we
have
proof
now
that
jeffrey
death
was
actually
determined
upon
if
miss
tuttle
had
not
shot
her
he
would
i
wonder
if
it
was
a
relief
to
him
on
reaching
his
door
to
find
that
the
deed
was
done
i
could
not
suppress
my
surprise
miss
tuttle
i
repeated
is
it
so
unmistakably
evident
that
jeffrey
did
not
get
to
the
moore
house
in
time
to
do
the
shooting
himself
the
major
gave
me
a
quick
look
i
thought
you
considered
miss
tuttle
the
guilty
one
i
felt
that
the
time
had
come
to
show
my
colors
i
have
changed
my
mind
said
i
i
can
give
you
no
good
reason
for
this
something
in
the
woman
herself
i
suppose
she
does
not
look
nor
act
like
a
criminal
while
not
desirous
of
raising
myself
in
opposition
to
the
judgment
of
those
so
greatly
my
superior
in
all
respects
i
have
had
this
feeling
and
i
am
courageous
enough
to
avow
it
and
yet
if
jeffrey
could
not
have
left
the
cemetery
gates
and
reached
the
moore
house
in
time
to
fulfil
all
the
conditions
of
this
tragedy
the
case
does
look
black
against
the
woman
she
admits
to
having
been
there
when
the
pistol
was
fired
unless
unless
what
you
have
something
new
to
tell
us
that
i
have
seen
ever
since
you
entered
the
room
what
is
it
i
cast
a
glance
at
the
door
should
i
be
able
to
finish
my
story
before
durbin
returned
i
thought
it
possible
and
though
still
upset
by
this
new
evidence
which
i
could
now
see
was
not
entirely
in
miss
tuttle
favor
i
spoke
up
with
what
spirit
i
might
i
have
just
come
from
spending
another
night
in
the
moore
house
all
the
efforts
heretofore
made
to
exhaust
its
secrets
have
been
founded
upon
a
theory
that
has
brought
us
nowhere
i
had
another
in
mind
and
i
was
anxious
to
test
it
before
resting
from
all
further
attempt
to
solve
this
riddle
and
it
has
not
failed
me
by
pursuing
a
clue
apparently
so
trivial
that
i
allowed
it
to
go
neglected
for
weeks
i
have
come
upon
the
key
to
the
many
mysterious
crimes
which
have
defiled
the
library
hearthstone
and
where
do
you
think
it
lies
not
in
the
hearthstone
itself
and
not
in
the
floor
under
the
settle
not
in
fact
in
the
library
at
all
but
in
the
picture
hanging
upstairs
in
the
southwest
chamber
the
picture
that
sketch
fit
only
for
the
garret
yes
to
you
and
to
most
people
surveying
it
it
is
just
what
you
say
and
nothing
more
but
to
the
initiated
few
pray
heaven
they
may
have
been
few
it
is
writing
conveying
secret
instructions
the
whole
combination
of
curves
which
go
to
make
up
this
sketch
is
a
curious
arrangement
of
words
inscribed
with
the
utmost
care
in
the
smallest
of
characters
viewed
with
a
magnifying
glass
the
uncertain
outlines
of
a
shadowy
face
surmounted
by
a
mass
of
hair
resolve
themselves
into
lines
of
writing
the
words
of
which
are
quite
intelligible
and
full
of
grim
and
unmistakable
purpose
i
have
read
those
lines
and
what
is
more
i
have
transcribed
them
into
plain
copy
will
you
read
them
they
contain
a
most
extraordinary
confession
a
confession
that
was
manifestly
intended
as
a
warning
but
which
unfortunately
has
had
very
different
results
it
may
explain
the
death
of
the
man
from
denver
even
if
it
cast
no
light
upon
the
other
inexplicable
features
of
the
remarkable
case
we
are
considering
as
i
spoke
i
laid
open
on
the
table
before
me
the
transcription
of
which
i
spoke
instantly
the
two
men
bent
over
it
when
they
looked
up
again
their
countenances
showed
not
excitement
only
but
appreciation
and
in
the
one
minute
of
triumph
which
i
then
enjoyed
all
that
had
wounded
or
disturbed
me
in
the
past
was
forgotten
you
are
a
man
in
a
thousand
was
the
major
first
enthusiastic
comment
at
which
i
was
conscious
of
regretting
with
very
pardonable
inconsistency
that
durbin
had
not
returned
in
time
to
hear
these
words
the
major
now
proposed
that
we
should
go
at
once
to
the
old
house
a
family
secret
like
this
does
not
crop
up
every
day
even
in
a
city
so
full
of
surprises
as
washington
we
will
hunt
for
the
spring
under
the
closet
drawers
and
see
what
happens
eh
and
on
our
way
there
here
he
turned
to
me
i
should
like
to
hear
the
particulars
concerning
the
little
clue
just
mentioned
by
the
way
interest
in
this
old
drawing
is
now
explained
he
knew
its
diabolical
secret
this
was
and
my
heart
was
heavy
for
miss
tuttle
who
seemed
to
be
so
deep
in
her
confidence
it
grew
still
heavier
when
durbin
joining
us
added
his
incredulity
to
the
air
of
suspicion
assumed
by
the
others
through
all
the
explanations
i
now
entered
into
i
found
myself
inwardly
repeating
with
somewhat
forced
iteration
i
will
not
believe
her
guilty
under
any
circumstances
she
carries
the
look
of
innocence
and
innocent
she
must
be
proved
whatever
the
result
may
be
to
francis
jeffrey
to
such
an
extent
had
i
been
influenced
by
the
lofty
expression
which
i
had
once
surprised
on
her
face
had
david
moore
been
sitting
behind
his
vines
that
morning
he
would
have
been
much
surprised
to
see
so
many
of
his
natural
enemies
intrude
on
his
property
at
so
early
an
hour
but
happily
he
had
not
yet
risen
and
we
were
able
to
enter
upon
our
investigations
without
being
watched
or
interrupted
by
him
our
first
move
was
to
go
in
a
body
to
the
southwest
chamber
take
down
the
picture
examine
it
with
a
and
satisfy
ourselves
that
the
words
i
had
picked
out
of
its
mazy
lines
were
really
to
be
found
there
this
done
and
my
veracity
established
we
next
proceeded
to
the
closet
where
according
to
the
instructions
embodied
in
this
picture
the
secret
spring
was
to
be
found
by
which
some
unknown
and
devilish
machinery
would
be
released
in
the
library
below
to
my
great
satisfaction
the
active
part
in
this
experiment
was
delegated
to
me
durbin
continued
to
be
a
mere
drawing
out
the
two
large
drawers
from
their
place
at
the
end
of
this
closet
i
set
them
aside
then
i
hunted
for
and
found
the
small
loophole
which
we
had
been
told
afforded
a
glimpse
of
the
library
hearthstone
but
seeing
nothing
through
it
i
called
for
a
light
to
be
placed
in
the
room
below
i
heard
durbin
go
down
then
the
major
and
finally
the
district
attorney
nothing
could
stay
their
curiosity
now
not
even
the
possibility
of
danger
which
as
yet
was
a
lurking
and
mysterious
one
but
when
a
light
shot
up
from
below
and
the
irregular
opening
before
me
became
a
loophole
through
which
i
could
catch
a
very
wide
glimpse
of
the
library
beneath
i
found
that
it
was
not
necessary
for
me
to
warn
them
to
keep
away
from
the
hearth
as
they
were
all
clustered
very
near
the
door
a
precaution
not
altogether
uncalled
for
at
so
hazardous
a
moment
are
you
ready
i
called
down
ready
rose
in
simultaneous
response
from
below
then
look
out
reaching
for
the
spring
cleverly
concealed
in
the
wall
at
my
right
i
vigorously
pressed
it
the
result
was
instantaneous
silently
but
with
unerring
certainty
something
small
round
and
deadly
fell
plumb
from
the
library
ceiling
to
where
the
settle
had
formerly
stood
against
the
hearthstone
finding
nothing
there
but
vacancy
to
expend
itself
upon
it
swung
about
for
a
moment
on
what
looked
like
a
wire
or
a
then
slowly
came
to
rest
within
a
foot
or
so
from
the
floor
a
cry
from
the
horrified
officials
below
was
what
first
brought
me
to
myself
withdrawing
from
my
narrow
quarters
i
hastened
down
to
them
and
added
one
more
white
face
to
the
three
i
found
congregated
in
the
doorway
in
the
diabolical
ingenuity
we
had
seen
displayed
crime
had
reached
its
acme
and
the
cup
of
human
depravity
seemed
full
when
we
had
regained
in
some
measure
our
we
all
advanced
for
a
closer
look
at
the
murderous
object
dangling
before
us
we
found
it
to
be
a
heavy
leaden
weight
painted
on
its
lower
end
to
match
the
bosses
of
which
appeared
at
regular
intervals
in
the
ornamentation
of
the
ceiling
when
drawn
up
into
place
that
is
when
occupying
the
hole
from
which
it
now
hung
suspended
the
portion
left
to
protrude
would
evidently
bear
so
small
a
proportion
to
its
real
bulk
as
to
justify
any
eye
in
believing
it
to
be
the
mate
and
the
harmless
mate
of
all
the
others
it
hangs
just
where
the
settle
stood
observed
durbin
significantly
and
just
at
the
point
where
the
cushions
invite
rest
as
the
colonel
so
suggestively
puts
it
in
his
strange
puzzle
of
a
confession
added
the
district
attorney
replace
the
old
seat
ordered
the
major
and
let
us
make
sure
of
this
ready
hands
at
once
grasped
it
and
with
some
effort
i
own
drew
it
carefully
back
into
position
you
see
quoth
durbin
we
did
devilish
came
from
the
major
lips
then
with
a
glance
at
the
ball
which
pushed
aside
by
the
seat
now
hung
over
its
edge
a
foot
or
so
from
the
floor
he
added
briskly
the
ball
has
fallen
to
the
full
length
of
the
cord
if
it
were
drawn
up
a
little
wait
i
eagerly
interposed
let
me
see
what
i
can
do
with
it
and
i
dashed
back
upstairs
and
into
the
closet
of
the
colonel
own
with
a
single
peep
down
to
see
if
they
were
still
on
the
watch
i
seized
the
handle
whose
position
i
had
made
sure
of
when
searching
for
the
spring
and
began
to
turn
when
instantly
so
quick
was
the
response
the
long
cord
stiffened
and
i
saw
the
ball
rise
into
sight
above
the
settle
top
stop
called
out
the
major
let
go
and
press
the
spring
again
i
hastened
to
obey
and
though
the
back
of
the
settle
hid
the
result
from
me
i
judged
from
the
look
and
attitude
of
those
below
that
the
old
colonel
calculations
had
been
made
with
great
exactness
and
that
the
one
comfortable
seat
on
the
rude
and
cumbersome
bench
had
been
so
placed
that
this
leaden
weight
in
descending
would
at
the
chosen
moment
strike
the
head
of
him
who
sat
there
inflicting
death
that
the
weight
should
be
made
just
heavy
enough
to
produce
a
fatal
concussion
without
damaging
the
skull
was
proof
of
the
extreme
care
with
which
this
subtle
apparatus
had
been
contrived
an
open
wound
would
have
aroused
questions
but
a
mere
bruise
might
readily
pass
as
a
result
of
the
victim
violent
contact
with
the
furnishings
of
the
hearth
toward
which
the
shocked
body
would
naturally
topple
the
fact
that
a
modern
jury
had
so
regarded
it
shows
how
justified
he
was
in
this
expectation
i
was
expending
my
wonder
on
this
and
on
a
new
discovery
which
with
a
very
decided
shock
to
myself
i
had
just
made
in
the
closet
when
the
command
came
to
turn
the
handle
again
and
to
keep
on
turning
it
till
it
would
turn
no
farther
i
complied
but
with
a
trembling
hand
and
though
i
did
not
watch
the
result
the
satisfaction
i
heard
expressed
below
was
significant
of
the
celerity
and
precision
with
which
the
weight
rose
foot
by
foot
to
the
ceiling
and
finally
slunk
snugly
and
without
seeming
jar
into
its
lair
when
a
few
minutes
later
i
rejoined
those
below
i
found
them
all
with
eyes
directed
toward
the
cornice
searching
for
the
hole
through
which
i
had
just
been
looking
it
was
next
to
imperceptible
so
naturally
had
it
been
made
to
fit
in
with
the
shadows
of
the
scroll
work
and
even
after
i
had
discovered
it
and
pointed
it
out
to
them
i
found
difficulty
in
making
them
believe
that
they
really
looked
upon
an
opening
but
when
once
convinced
of
this
the
district
attorney
remark
was
significant
i
am
glad
that
my
name
is
not
moore
the
superintendent
made
no
reply
his
eye
had
caught
mine
and
he
had
become
very
thoughtful
one
of
the
two
candelabra
belonging
to
the
parlor
mantel
was
found
lying
on
that
closet
floor
he
observed
somebody
has
entered
there
lately
as
lately
as
the
day
when
pfeiffer
was
seated
here
pardon
me
i
impetuously
cried
pfeiffer
death
is
quite
explained
and
drawing
forward
my
hand
which
up
to
this
moment
i
had
held
behind
my
back
i
slowly
unclosed
it
before
their
astonished
eyes
a
bit
of
lace
lay
in
my
palm
a
delicate
bit
such
as
is
only
worn
by
women
in
full
dress
where
did
you
find
that
asked
the
major
with
the
first
show
of
deep
emotion
i
have
ever
observed
in
him
my
agitation
was
greater
than
his
as
i
replied
in
the
rough
boarding
under
those
drawers
some
woman
arm
and
hand
has
preceded
mine
in
stealthy
search
after
that
fatal
spring
a
woman
who
wore
lace
valuable
lace
there
was
but
one
woman
connected
with
this
affair
who
rightly
answered
these
conditions
the
bride
veronica
moore
xxiii
words
in
the
night
had
i
any
premonition
of
the
astounding
fact
thus
suddenly
and
i
may
say
dramatically
revealed
to
us
during
the
weeks
i
had
devoted
to
the
elucidation
of
the
causes
and
circumstances
of
death
i
do
not
think
so
nothing
in
her
face
as
i
remembered
it
nothing
in
the
feeling
evinced
toward
her
by
husband
or
sister
had
prepared
me
for
a
disclosure
of
crime
so
revolting
as
to
surpass
all
that
i
had
ever
imagined
or
could
imagine
in
a
woman
of
such
dainty
personality
and
unmistakable
culture
nor
was
the
superintendent
or
the
district
attorney
less
confounded
by
the
event
durbin
only
tried
to
look
wise
and
strut
about
but
it
was
of
no
use
he
deceived
nobody
veronica
moore
real
connection
with
death
a
death
which
in
some
inscrutable
way
had
in
so
short
a
time
led
to
her
own
was
an
overwhelming
surprise
to
every
one
of
us
the
superintendent
as
was
natural
recovered
first
this
throws
quite
a
new
light
upon
the
matter
said
he
now
we
can
understand
why
jeffrey
uttered
that
extraordinary
avowal
overheard
on
the
bridge
must
die
she
had
come
to
him
with
blood
on
her
hands
it
seemed
incredible
nay
more
unreal
i
recalled
the
sweet
refined
face
turned
up
to
me
from
the
bare
boards
of
this
same
floor
the
accounts
i
had
read
of
the
vivacity
of
her
spirits
and
the
wild
charm
of
her
manner
till
the
shadow
of
this
old
house
fell
upon
her
i
marveled
still
feeling
myself
in
the
dark
still
clinging
to
my
faith
in
womankind
still
asking
to
what
depths
her
sister
had
followed
her
in
the
mazes
of
crime
we
were
forced
to
recognize
but
could
not
understand
durbin
had
no
such
feelings
and
no
such
scruples
as
was
shown
by
the
sarcastic
comment
which
now
left
his
lips
so
he
cried
we
have
to
do
with
three
criminals
instead
of
two
nice
family
the
but
no
one
paid
any
attention
to
him
addressing
the
major
the
district
attorney
asked
when
he
expected
to
hear
from
denver
adding
that
it
had
now
become
of
the
first
importance
to
ascertain
the
exact
relations
existing
between
the
persons
under
suspicion
and
the
latest
victim
of
this
deadly
mechanism
the
major
answer
was
abrupt
he
had
been
expecting
a
report
for
days
he
was
expecting
one
yet
if
it
came
in
at
any
time
night
or
day
he
was
to
be
immediately
notified
word
might
be
sent
him
in
an
hour
in
a
minute
were
his
remarks
a
prophecy
he
had
hardly
ceased
speaking
when
an
officer
appeared
with
a
telegram
in
his
hand
this
the
major
eagerly
took
and
noting
that
it
was
in
cipher
read
it
by
means
of
the
code
he
carried
in
his
pocket
translated
it
ran
thus

none

you

of

no
hint
of
their
possible
meeting
here
it
fell
to
me
to
fetch
miss
tuttle
i
was
glad
of
this
as
it
gave
me
a
few
minutes
by
myself
in
which
to
compose
my
mind
and
adjust
my
thoughts
to
the
new
conditions
opened
up
by
the
amazing
facts
which
had
just
come
to
light
but
beyond
the
fact
that
jeffrey
had
been
answerable
for
the
death
which
had
occurred
in
the
library

marriage

words

two
would
add
to
our
present
knowledge
in
my
anxiety
to
have
this
question
answered
i
hastened
my
steps
and
was
soon
at
the
door
of
miss
tuttle
present
dwelling
place
i
had
not
seen
this
lady
since
the
inquest
and
my
heart
beat
high
as
i
sat
awaiting
her
appearance
in
the
dim
little
parlor
where
i
had
been
seated
by
the
person
who
held
her
under
secret
surveillance
the
scene
i
had
just
been
through
the
uncertain
nature
of
the
relations
held
by
this
beautiful
woman
both
toward
the
crime
just
discovered
and
the
one
long
associated
with
her
name
lent
to
these
few
moments
of
anticipation
an
emotion
which
poorly
prepared
me
for
the
touching
sight
of
the
patient
smile
with
which
she
presently
entered
but
i
doubt
if
she
noticed
my
agitation
she
was
too
much
swayed
by
her
own
advancing
upon
me
in
all
the
unconscious
pride
of
her
great
beauty
she
tremulously
remarked
you
have
a
message
for
me
is
it
from
headquarters
or
has
the
district
attorney
still
more
questions
to
ask
i
have
a
much
more
trying
errand
than
that
i
hastened
to
say
with
some
idea
of
preparing
her
for
an
experience
that
could
not
fail
to
be
one
of
exceptional
trial
for
reasons
which
will
be
explained
to
you
by
those
in
greater
authority
than
myself
you
are
wanted
at
the
house
where
i
could
not
help
stammering
under
the
light
of
her
melancholy
eyes
where
i
saw
you
once
before
i
lamely
concluded
the
house
in
waverley
avenue
she
objected
wildly
with
the
first
signs
of
positive
terror
i
had
ever
beheld
in
her
i
nodded
dropping
my
eyes
what
call
had
i
to
penetrate
the
conscience
of
this
woman
are
they
there
all
there
she
presently
asked
again
the
police
and
and
mr
jeffrey
madam
i
respectfully
protested
my
duty
is
limited
to
conducting
you
to
the
place
named
a
carriage
is
waiting
may
i
beg
that
you
will
prepare
yourself
to
go
at
once
to
waverley
avenue
for
answer
she
subjected
me
to
a
long
and
earnest
look
which
i
found
it
impossible
to
evade
then
she
hastened
from
the
room
but
with
very
unsteady
steps
evidently
the
courage
which
had
upborne
her
so
long
was
beginning
to
fail
her
very
countenance
was
changed
had
she
recognized
as
i
meant
she
should
that
the
secret
of
the
moore
house
was
no
longer
a
secret
confined
to
her
own
breast
and
to
that
of
her
unhappy
when
she
returned
ready
for
her
ride
this
change
in
her
spirits
was
less
observable
and
by
the
time
we
had
reached
the
house
in
waverley
avenue
she
had
so
far
regained
her
old
courage
as
to
move
and
speak
with
the
calmness
of
despair
if
not
of
mental
serenity
the
major
was
awaiting
us
at
the
door
and
bowed
gravely
before
her
heavily
veiled
figure
miss
tuttle
he
asked
without
any
preamble
the
moment
she
was
well
inside
the
house
may
i
inquire
of
you
here
and
before
i
show
you
what
will
excuse
us
for
subjecting
you
to
the
distress
of
entering
these
doors
whether
your
sister
jeffrey
had
any
other
name
or
was
ever
known
by
any
other
name
than
that
of
veronica
she
was
christened
antoinette
as
well
as
veronica
but
the
person
in
whose
memory
the
former
name
was
given
her
was
no
honor
to
the
family
and
she
very
soon
dropped
it
and
was
only
known
as
veronica
oh
what
have
i
done
she
cried
awed
and
frightened
by
the
silence
which
followed
the
utterance
of
these
simple
words
no
one
answered
her
for
the
first
time
in
her
presence
the
minds
of
those
who
faced
her
were
with
another
than
herself
the
bride
the
unhappy
bride
no
maiden
but
a
wife
nay
a
wife
one
minute
a
widow
the
next
and
then
again
a
bride
before
the
husband
lying
below
was
cold
what
wander
that
she
shrank
when
her
bridegroom
lips
approached
her
own
or
that
their
honeymoon
was
a
disappointment
or
that
the
shadow
which
fell
upon
her
on
that
evil
day
never
left
her
till
she
gave
herself
wholly
up
to
its
influence
and
returned
to
die
on
the
spot
made
awful
by
her
own
crime
before
any
of
us
were
quite
ready
to
speak
a
tap
at
the
door
told
us
that
durbin
had
arrived
with
jeffrey
when
they
had
been
admitted
and
the
latter
saw
miss
tuttle
standing
there
he
too
seemed
to
realize
that
a
turn
had
come
in
their
affairs
and
that
courage
rather
than
endurance
was
the
quality
most
demanded
from
him
facing
the
small
group
clustered
in
the
dismal
hall
fraught
with
such
unutterable
associations
he
earnestly
prayed
do
not
keep
me
in
suspense
why
am
i
summoned
here
the
reply
was
as
grave
as
the
occasion
warranted
you
are
summoned
to
learn
the
murderous
secret
of
these
old
walls
and
who
it
was
that
last
made
use
of
it
do
you
feel
inclined
to
hear
these
details
from
my
lips
or
are
you
ready
to
state
that
you
already
know
the
means
by
which
so
many
persons
in
times
past
as
well
as
in
times
present
have
met
death
here
we
do
not
require
you
to
answer
us
i
know
the
means
he
allowed
recognizing
without
doubt
that
the
crisis
of
crises
had
come
and
that
denial
would
be
worse
than
useless
then
it
only
remains
for
us
to
acquaint
you
with
the
identity
of
the
person
who
last
pressed
the
fatal
spring
but
perhaps
you
know
that
too
i
he
paused
words
were
impossible
to
him
and
in
that
pause
his
eyes
flashed
helplessly
in
the
direction
of
miss
tuttle
but
the
major
was
quick
on
his
feet
and
was
already
between
him
and
that
lady
this
act
forced
from
jeffrey
lips
the
following
broken
sentence
i
should
like
you
to
tell
me
great
gasps
came
with
each
heavily
spoken
word
perhaps
this
morsel
of
lace
will
do
it
in
a
gentler
manner
than
i
could
responded
the
district
attorney
opening
his
hand
in
which
lay
the
scrap
of
lace
that
an
hour
or
so
before
i
had
plucked
away
from
the
boarding
of
that
fatal
closet
jeffrey
eyed
it
and
understood
his
hands
went
up
to
his
face
and
he
swayed
to
the
point
of
falling
miss
tuttle
came
quickly
forward
oh
she
moaned
as
her
eyes
fell
on
the
little
white
shred
the
providence
of
god
has
found
us
out
we
have
suffered
labored
and
denied
in
vain
yes
came
in
dreary
echo
from
the
man
none
of
us
had
understood
till
now
so
great
a
crime
could
not
be
hid
god
will
have
vengeance
what
are
we
that
we
should
hope
to
avert
it
by
any
act
or
at
any
cost
the
major
with
his
eyes
fixed
piercingly
on
this
miserable
man
replied
with
one
pregnant
sentence
then
you
forced
your
wife
to
suicide
no
he
began
but
before
another
word
could
follow
miss
tuttle
resplendent
in
beauty
and
beaming
with
new
life
broke
in
with
the
fervid
cry
you
wrong
him
and
you
wrong
her
by
such
a
suggestion
it
was
not
her
husband
but
her
conscience
that
forced
her
to
this
retributive
act
what
jeffrey
might
have
done
had
she
proved
obdurate
and
blind
to
the
enormity
of
her
own
guilt
i
do
not
know
but
that
he
is
innocent
of
so
influencing
her
is
proved
by
the
shock
he
suffered
at
finding
she
had
taken
her
punishment
into
her
own
hands
jeffrey
will
please
answer
the
question
insisted
the
major
whereupon
the
latter
with
great
effort
but
with
the
first
appearance
of
real
candor
yet
seen
in
him
said
earnestly
i
did
nothing
to
influence
her
i
was
in
no
condition
to
do
so
i
was
benumbed
dead
when
first
she
told
me
it
was
in
some
words
muttered
in
her
sleep
i
thought
she
was
laboring
under
some
fearful
nightmare
but
when
she
persisted
and
i
questioned
her
and
found
the
horror
true
i
was
like
a
man
turned
instantly
into
stone
save
for
one
intolerable
throb
within
i
am
still
so
everything
passes
by
me
like
a
dream
she
was
so
young
seemingly
so
innocent
and
i
loved
her
gentlemen
you
have
thought
me
guilty
of
my
wife
death
this
young
creature
to
whom
i
ascribed
all
the
virtues
and
i
was
willing
willing
that
you
should
think
so
willing
even
to
face
the
distrust
and
opprobrium
of
the
whole
world
and
so
was
her
sister
the
noble
woman
whom
you
see
before
you
rather
than
that
the
full
horror
of
her
crime
should
be
known
and
a
name
so
dear
be
given
up
to
execration
we
thought
we
could
keep
the
secret
we
felt
that
we
must
keep
the
secret
we
took
an
oath
in
french
in
the
carriage
with
the
detectives
opposite
us
she
kept
it
god
bless
her
i
kept
it
but
it
was
all
useless
a
tiny
bit
of
lace
is
found
hanging
to
a
lifeless
splinter
and
all
our
efforts
all
the
hopes
and
agony
of
weeks
are
gone
for
naught
the
world
will
soon
know
of
her
awful
deed
and
i
he
still
loved
her
that
was
apparent
in
every
look
in
every
word
he
uttered
we
marveled
in
awkward
silence
and
were
glad
when
the
major
said
the
deed
as
i
take
it
was
an
unpremeditated
one
on
her
part
is
that
why
her
honor
was
dearer
to
you
than
your
own
and
why
you
could
risk
the
reputation
if
not
the
life
of
the
woman
who
you
say
sacrificed
herself
to
it
yes
it
was
unpremeditated
she
hardly
realized
her
act
if
you
must
know
her
heart
through
all
this
dreadful
business
we
have
her
words
to
show
you
words
which
she
spent
the
last
miserable
day
of
her
life
in
writing
the
few
lines
which
i
showed
the
captain
and
which
have
been
published
to
the
world
was
an
inclosure
meant
for
the
public
eye
the
real
letter
telling
the
whole
terrible
truth
i
kept
for
myself
and
for
the
sister
who
already
knew
her
sin
oh
we
did
everything
we
could
and
he
again
moaned
but
it
was
in
vain
quite
in
vain
there
were
no
signs
of
subterfuge
in
him
now
and
we
all
unless
i
except
durbin
began
to
yield
him
credence
durbin
never
gives
credence
to
anybody
whose
name
he
has
once
heard
associated
with
crime
and
this
pfeiffer
was
contracted
to
her
a
man
she
had
secretly
married
while
a
and
who
at
this
very
critical
instant
had
found
his
way
to
the
house
you
shall
read
her
letter
it
was
meant
for
me
for
me
only
but
you
shall
see
it
i
can
not
talk
of
him
or
of
her
crime
it
is
enough
that
i
have
been
unable
to
think
of
anything
else
since
first
those
dreadful
words
fell
front
her
lips
in
sleep
hours
before
she
died
then
with
the
inconsistency
of
great
anguish
he
suddenly
broke
forth
into
the
details
he
shrank
from
and
cried
she
muttered
lying
there
that
she
was
no
bigamist
that
she
had
killed
one
husband
before
she
married
the
other
killed
him
in
the
old
house
and
by
the
method
her
ancestors
had
taught
her
and
i
risen
on
my
elbow
listened
with
the
sweat
oozing
from
my
forehead
but
not
believing
her
oh
not
believing
her
any
more
than
any
one
of
you
would
believe
such
words
uttered
in
a
dream
by
the
darling
of
your
heart
but
when
with
a
sigh
she
murmured
and
raised
her
fists
tiny
fists
hands
which
i
had
kissed
a
thousand
times
and
shook
them
in
the
air
an
awful
terror
seized
me
and
i
sought
to
grasp
them
and
hold
them
down
but
was
hindered
by
some
nameless
inner
recoil
under
which
i
could
not
speak
nor
gasp
nor
move
of
course
it
was
some
she
was
laboring
under
a
nightmare
of
unimaginable
acts
and
thoughts
but
it
was
one
to
hold
me
back
and
when
she
lay
quiet
again
and
her
face
resumed
its
old
sweetness
in
the
moonlight
i
found
myself
staring
at
her
almost
as
if
it
were
true
what
she
had
said
that
word
that
awful
word
which
no
woman
could
use
with
regard
to
herself
even
in
dreams
unless
something
an
echo
from
the
discordant
chord
in
our
two
weeks
married
life
rose
like
the
confirmation
of
a
doubt
in
my
shocked
and
rebellious
breast
from
that
hour
till
dawn
nothing
in
that
slowly
brightening
room
seemed
real
not
her
face
lying
buried
in
its
youthful
locks
upon
the
pillow
not
the
objects
and
by
which
we
were
surrounded
not
myself
most
of
all
not
myself
unless
the
icy
dew
oozing
from
the
roots
of
my
lifted
hair
was
real
unless
that
shape
fearsome
vague
but
persistent
which
hovered
in
the
shadows
above
us
drawing
a
line
of
eternal
separation
between
me
and
my
wife
was
a
thing
which
could
be
caught
and
strangled
and
oh
i
rave
i
chatter
like
a
madman
but
i
did
not
rave
that
night
nor
did
i
rave
when
in
the
bright
broad
sunlight
her
eye
slowly
unclosed
and
she
started
to
see
me
bending
so
near
her
but
not
with
my
usual
kiss
or
glad
good
morning
i
could
not
question
her
then
i
dared
not
the
smile
which
slowly
rose
to
her
lips
was
too
piteous
it
showed
confidence
i
waited
till
after
breakfast
then
while
she
was
seated
where
she
could
not
see
my
face
i
whispered
the
question
you
know
that
you
have
had
a
horrible
dream
she
shrieked
and
turned
i
saw
her
face
and
knew
that
what
she
had
uttered
in
her
sleep
was
true
i
have
no
remembrance
of
what
i
said
to
her
she
tried
to
tell
me
how
she
had
been
tempted
and
how
she
had
not
realized
her
own
act
till
the
moment
i
bent
down
to
kiss
her
lips
as
her
husband
but
i
did
not
stop
to
listen
i
could
not
i
flew
immediately
to
miss
tuttle
with
the
violent
demand
as
to
whether
she
knew
that
her
sister
was
already
a
wife
when
she
married
me
and
when
she
cried
out
and
showed
great
dismay
i
broke
forth
with
the
dreadful
tale
and
cowered
in
unmanly
anguish
at
her
feet
and
went
mad
and
lost
myself
for
a
little
while
then
i
went
back
to
my
wretched
wife
and
asked
her
how
the
awful
deed
had
been
done
she
told
me
and
again
i
did
not
believe
her
and
began
to
look
upon
it
all
as
some
wild
dream
or
the
distempered
fancies
of
a
disordered
brain
this
thought
calmed
me
and
i
spoke
gently
to
her
and
even
tried
to
take
her
hand
but
she
herself
was
raving
now
and
clung
about
my
knees
murmuring
words
of
such
anguish
and
contrition
that
my
worst
fears
returned
and
only
stopping
to
take
the
key
of
the
moore
house
from
my
bureau
i
left
the
house
and
wandered
madly
i
know
not
where
i
did
not
go
back
that
day
i
could
not
face
her
again
till
i
knew
how
much
of
her
confession
was
fancy
and
how
much
was
fact
i
roamed
the
streets
carrying
that
key
from
one
end
of
the
city
to
the
other
and
at
night
i
used
it
to
open
the
house
which
she
had
declared
contained
so
dreadful
a
secret
i
had
bought
candles
on
my
way
there
but
forgetting
to
take
them
from
the
store
i
had
no
light
with
which
to
penetrate
the
horrible
place
that
even
the
moon
refused
to
illumine
i
realized
this
when
once
in
but
would
not
go
back
all
i
have
told
about
using
matches
to
light
me
to
the
southwest
chamber
is
true
also
my
coming
upon
the
old
candelabrum
there
with
a
candle
in
one
of
its
sockets
this
candle
i
lit
my
sole
reason
for
seeking
this
room
being
my
desire
to
examine
the
antique
sketch
for
the
words
which
she
had
said
could
be
found
there
i
had
failed
to
bring
a
with
me
but
my
eyes
are
phenomenally
sharp
knowing
where
to
look
i
was
able
to
pick
out
enough
words
here
and
there
in
the
lines
composing
the
hair
to
feel
quite
sure
that
my
wife
had
neither
deceived
me
nor
been
deceived
as
to
certain
directions
being
embodied
there
in
writing
shaken
in
my
last
lingering
hope
but
not
yet
quite
convinced
that
these
words
pointed
to
outrageous
crime
i
flew
next
to
the
closet
and
drew
out
the
fatal
drawer
you
have
been
there
and
know
what
the
place
is
but
no
one
but
myself
can
ever
realize
what
it
was
for
me
still
loving
still
clinging
to
a
wild
inconsequent
belief
in
my
wife
to
grope
in
that
mouth
of
hell
for
the
spring
she
had
chattered
about
in
her
sleep
to
find
it
press
it
and
then
to
hear
down
in
the
dark
of
the
fearsome
recess
the
sound
of
something
deadly
strike
against
what
i
took
to
be
the
cushions
of
the
old
settle
standing
at
the
edge
of
the
library
hearthstone
i
think
i
must
have
fainted
for
when
i
found
myself
possessed
of
sufficient
consciousness
to
withdraw
from
that
hole
of
death
the
candle
in
the
candelabrum
was
shorter
by
an
inch
than
when
i
first
thrust
my
head
into
the
gap
made
by
the
removed
drawers
in
putting
back
the
drawers
i
hit
the
candelabrum
with
my
foot
upsetting
it
and
throwing
out
the
burning
candle
as
the
flames
began
to
lick
the
boarding
of
the
floor
a
momentary
impulse
seized
me
to
rush
away
and
leave
the
whole
place
to
burn
but
i
did
not
with
a
sudden
frenzy
i
stamped
out
the
flame
and
then
finding
myself
in
darkness
griped
my
way
downstairs
and
out
if
i
entered
the
library
i
do
not
remember
it
some
lapses
must
be
pardoned
a
man
involved
as
i
was
but
the
fact
which
you
dismiss
so
lightly
is
an
important
one
insisted
the
major
we
must
know
positively
whether
you
entered
this
room
or
not
i
have
no
recollection
of
doing
so
then
you
can
not
tell
us
whether
the
little
table
was
standing
there
with
the
candelabrum
upon
it
or
i
can
tell
you
nothing
about
it
the
major
after
a
long
look
at
this
suffering
man
turned
toward
miss
tuttle
you
must
have
loved
your
sister
very
much
he
sententiously
remarked
she
flushed
and
for
the
first
time
her
eyes
fell
from
their
on
jeffrey
face
i
loved
her
reputation
was
her
quiet
answer
and
the
rest
died
in
her
throat
but
we
all
such
of
us
i
mean
who
were
possessed
of
the
least
sensibility
or
insight
knew
how
that
sentence
sounded
as
finished
in
her
heart
and
i
loved
him
who
asked
this
sacrifice
of
me
yet
was
her
conduct
not
quite
clear
and
to
save
that
reputation
you
tied
the
pistol
to
her
wrist
insinuated
the
major
no
was
her
vehement
reply
i
never
knew
what
i
was
tying
to
her
my
testimony
in
that
regard
was
absolutely
true
she
held
the
pistol
concealed
in
the
folds
of
her
dress
i
did
not
dream
i
could
not
that
she
was
contemplating
any
such
end
to
the
atrocious
crime
to
which
she
had
confessed
her
manner
was
too
light
too
airy
and
too
frivolous
a
manner
adopted
as
i
now
see
to
forestall
all
questions
and
hold
back
all
expressions
of
feeling
on
my
part
these
hanging
ends
of
ribbon
to
my
wrist
were
her
words
them
tight
a
knot
under
and
a
bow
on
top
i
am
going
out
there
do
say
anything
what
you
want
to
talk
about
will
keep
till
tomorrow
for
one
night
more
i
am
going
to
make
merry
to
to
enjoy
myself
she
was
laughing
i
thought
her
horribly
callous
and
trembled
with
such
an
unspeakable
repulsion
that
i
had
difficulty
in
making
the
knot
to
speak
at
all
would
have
been
impossible
neither
did
i
dare
to
look
in
her
face
i
was
touching
the
hand
and
she
kept
on
laughing
such
a
hollow
laugh
covering
up
such
an
awful
resolve
when
she
turned
to
give
me
that
last
injunction
about
the
note
this
resolve
glared
still
in
her
eyes
and
you
never
suspected
not
for
an
instant
i
did
not
do
justice
either
to
her
misery
or
to
her
conscience
i
fear
that
i
have
never
done
her
justice
in
anyway
i
thought
her
light
i
did
not
know
that
it
was
assumed
to
hide
a
terrible
secret
then
you
had
no
knowledge
of
the
contract
she
had
entered
into
while
a
not
in
the
least
another
woman
and
not
myself
had
been
her
confidante
a
woman
who
has
since
died
no
intimation
of
her
first
unfortunate
marriage
had
ever
reached
me
till
jeffrey
rushed
in
upon
me
that
tuesday
morning
with
her
dreadful
confession
on
his
lips
the
district
attorney
who
did
not
seem
quite
satisfied
on
a
certain
point
passed
over
by
the
major
now
took
the
opportunity
of
saying
you
assure
us
that
you
had
no
idea
that
this
once
lighthearted
sister
of
yours
meditated
suicide
when
she
left
you
and
i
repeat
it
sir
then
why
did
you
immediately
go
to
jeffrey
drawer
where
you
could
have
no
business
unless
it
was
to
see
if
she
had
taken
his
pistol
with
her
miss
tuttle
head
fell
and
a
soft
flush
broke
through
the
pallor
of
her
cheek
because
i
was
thinking
of
him
because
i
was
terrified
for
him
he
had
left
the
house
the
morning
before
in
a
condition
and
had
not
come
back
to
sleep
or
eat
since
i
did
not
know
what
a
man
so
outraged
in
every
sacred
feeling
of
love
and
honor
might
be
tempted
to
do
i
thought
of
suicide
i
remembered
the
old
house
and
how
he
had
said
do
believe
her
i
do
believe
she
ever
did
so
an
act
or
that
any
such
dreadful
machinery
is
in
that
house
i
never
shall
believe
it
till
i
have
seen
and
handled
it
myself
it
is
a
nightmare
cora
we
are
insane
i
thought
of
this
sirs
and
when
i
went
into
her
room
to
change
the
place
of
the
little
note
in
the
book
i
went
to
his
bureau
drawer
not
to
look
for
the
pistol
i
did
not
think
of
that
then
but
to
see
if
the
keys
of
the
moore
house
were
still
there
i
knew
that
they
were
kept
in
this
drawer
for
i
had
been
present
in
the
room
when
they
were
brought
in
after
the
wedding
i
had
also
been
enough
to
conclude
that
if
they
were
gone
it
was
he
who
had
taken
them
they
were
gone
and
that
was
why
i
flew
immediately
from
the
house
to
the
old
place
in
waverley
avenue
i
was
concerned
for
jeffrey
i
feared
to
find
him
there
demented
or
dead
but
you
had
no
key
no
jeffrey
had
taken
one
of
them
and
my
sister
the
other
but
the
lack
of
a
key
or
even
of
a
light
for
the
missing
candles
were
not
taken
by
me
could
not
keep
me
at
home
after
i
was
once
convinced
that
he
had
gone
to
this
dreadful
house
if
i
could
not
get
in
i
could
at
least
hammer
at
the
door
or
rouse
the
neighbors
something
must
be
done
i
did
not
think
what
i
merely
flew
did
you
know
that
the
house
had
two
keys
not
then
but
your
sister
did
probably
and
finding
the
only
key
as
you
supposed
gone
you
flew
to
the
moore
house
immediately
and
now
what
else
i
found
the
door
unlocked
that
was
done
by
mrs
jeffrey
yes
but
i
did
not
think
of
her
then
and
you
went
in
yes
it
was
all
dark
but
i
felt
my
way
till
i
came
to
the
gilded
pillars
why
did
you
go
there
because
i
felt
i
knew
if
he
were
anywhere
in
that
house
he
would
be
there
and
why
did
you
stop
her
voice
rose
above
its
usual
quiet
pitch
in
shrill
protest
you
know
you
know
i
heard
a
from
within
then
a
fall
i
do
remember
anything
else
they
say
i
went
wandering
about
town
perhaps
i
did
it
is
all
a
blank
to
me
everything
is
a
blank
till
the
policeman
said
that
my
sister
was
dead
and
i
learned
for
the
first
time
that
the
shot
i
had
heard
in
the
moore
house
was
not
the
signal
of
his
death
but
hers
had
i
been
myself
when
at
that
library
door
she
added
after
a
moment
of
silence
i
would
have
rushed
in
at
the
sound
of
that
shot
and
have
received
my
sister
dying
breath
cora
the
cry
was
from
jeffrey
and
seemed
to
be
quite
involuntary
in
the
weeks
during
which
we
have
been
kept
from
speaking
together
i
have
turned
all
these
events
over
in
my
mind
till
i
longed
for
any
respite
even
that
of
the
grave
but
in
all
my
thinking
i
never
attributed
this
motive
to
your
visit
here
will
you
forgive
me
there
was
a
new
tone
in
his
voice
a
tone
which
no
woman
could
hear
without
emotion
you
had
other
things
to
think
of
she
said
and
her
lips
trembled
never
have
i
seen
on
the
human
face
a
more
beautiful
expression
than
i
saw
on
hers
at
that
moment
nor
do
i
think
jeffrey
had
either
for
as
he
marked
it
his
own
regard
softened
almost
to
tenderness
the
major
had
no
time
for
sentimentalities
turning
to
jeffrey
he
said
one
more
question
before
we
send
for
the
letter
which
you
say
will
give
us
full
insight
into
your
wife
crime
do
you
remember
what
occurred
on
the
bridge
at
georgetown
just
before
you
came
into
town
that
night
he
shook
his
head
did
you
meet
any
one
there
i
do
not
know
can
you
remember
your
state
of
mind
i
was
facing
the
future
and
what
did
you
see
in
the
future
death
death
for
her
and
death
for
me
a
crime
was
on
her
soul
and
she
must
die
and
if
she
then
myself
i
knew
no
other
course
i
could
not
summon
the
police
point
out
my
bride
of
a
fortnight
and
with
the
declaration
that
she
had
been
betrayed
into
killing
a
man
coldly
deliver
her
up
to
justice
neither
could
i
live
at
her
side
knowing
the
guilty
secret
which
parted
us
or
live
anywhere
in
the
world
under
this
same
consciousness
therefore
i
meant
to
kill
myself
before
another
sun
rose
but
she
was
more
deeply
stricken
with
a
sense
of
her
own
guilt
than
i
realized
when
i
returned
home
for
the
pistol
which
was
to
end
our
common
misery
i
found
that
she
had
taken
her
punishment
into
her
own
hands
this
strangely
affected
me
but
when
i
found
that
in
doing
this
she
had
remembered
that
i
should
have
to
face
the
world
after
she
was
gone
and
so
left
a
few
lines
for
me
to
show
in
explanation
of
her
act
my
revolt
against
her
received
a
check
which
the
reading
of
her
letter
only
increased
but
the
lines
she
thus
wrote
and
left
were
not
true
lines
all
her
heart
was
mine
and
if
it
was
a
wicked
heart
she
has
atoned
he
paused
quite
overcome
others
amongst
us
were
overcome
too
but
only
for
a
moment
the
following
remark
from
the
district
attorney
soon
recalled
us
to
the
practical
aspects
of
the
case
you
have
accounted
for
many
facts
not
hitherto
understood
but
there
is
still
a
very
important
one
which
neither
yourself
nor
miss
tuttle
has
yet
made
plain
there
was
a
candle
on
the
scene
of
crime
it
was
out
when
this
officer
arrived
here
there
was
also
one
found
burning
in
the
upstairs
room
aside
from
the
one
you
professedly
used
in
your
tour
of
inspection
there
whence
came
those
candles
and
did
your
wife
blow
out
the
one
in
the
library
herself
previous
to
the
shooting
or
was
it
blown
out
afterward
and
by
other
lips
these
are
questions
which
as
i
have
already
said
i
have
no
means
of
answering
repeated
jeffrey
the
courage
which
brought
her
here
may
have
led
her
to
supply
herself
with
light
and
hard
as
it
is
to
conceive
she
may
even
have
found
nerve
to
blow
out
the
light
before
she
lifted
the
pistol
to
her
breast
the
district
attorney
and
the
major
looked
unconvinced
and
the
latter
turning
toward
miss
tuttle
asked
if
she
had
any
remark
to
make
on
the
subject
but
she
could
only
repeat
jeffrey
statement
these
are
questions
i
can
not
answer
either
i
have
said
that
i
stopped
at
the
library
door
which
means
that
i
saw
nothing
of
what
passed
within
here
the
major
asked
where
jeffrey
letter
was
to
be
found
it
was
jeffrey
who
replied
search
in
my
room
for
a
book
with
an
outside
cover
of
paper
still
on
it
you
will
probably
find
it
on
my
table
the
inner
cover
is
red
bring
that
book
here
our
secret
is
hidden
in
it
durbin
disappeared
on
this
errand
i
followed
him
as
far
as
the
door
but
i
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
state
that
i
had
seen
this
book
lying
on
the
table
when
i
paid
my
second
visit
to
jeffrey
room
in
company
with
the
coroner
the
thought
that
my
hand
had
been
within
reach
of
this
man
secret
so
many
weeks
before
was
sufficiently
humiliating
without
being
shared
we
afterwards
found
that
these
candles
were
never
delivered
at
the
house
at
all
that
they
had
been
placed
in
the
wrong
basket
and
left
in
a
neighboring
kitchen
xxiv
tantalizing
tactics
i
made
my
way
to
the
front
door
but
returned
almost
immediately
drawing
the
major
aside
i
whispered
a
request
which
led
to
a
certain
small
article
being
passed
over
to
me
after
which
i
sauntered
out
on
the
stoop
just
in
time
to
encounter
the
spruce
but
irate
figure
of
moore
who
had
crossed
from
the
opposite
side
ah
said
i
good
morning
and
made
him
my
most
deferential
bow
he
glared
and
rudge
glared
from
his
place
on
the
farther
curb
evidently
the
police
were
not
in
favor
with
the
occupants
of
the
cottage
that
morning
when
is
this
to
cease
he
curtly
demanded
when
are
these
trespasses
upon
an
honest
citizen
property
coming
to
an
end
i
wake
with
a
light
heart
expecting
that
my
house
which
is
certainly
as
much
mine
as
is
any
man
in
washington
would
be
handed
over
this
very
day
for
my
habitation
when
what
do
i
see
one
police
officer
leaving
the
front
door
and
another
sunning
himself
in
the
vestibule
how
many
more
of
you
are
within
i
do
not
presume
to
ask
some
no
doubt
and
not
one
of
you
smart
enough
to
wind
up
this
matter
and
have
done
with
it
ah
i
do
know
about
that
i
drawled
and
looked
very
wise
his
curiosity
was
aroused
anything
new
he
snapped
possibly
i
returned
in
a
way
to
exasperate
a
saint
he
stepped
on
to
the
porch
beside
me
i
was
too
abstracted
to
notice
i
was
engaged
in
eying
rudge
do
you
know
said
i
after
an
instant
of
what
i
meant
should
be
one
of
uncomfortable
suspense
on
his
part
that
i
have
a
greater
respect
than
ever
for
that
animal
of
yours
since
learning
the
very
good
reason
he
has
for
refusing
to
cross
the
street
ha
what
that
he
asked
with
a
quick
look
behind
him
at
the
watchful
brute
straining
toward
him
with
nose
over
the
gutter
he
sees
farther
than
we
can
his
eyes
penetrate
walls
and
partitions
i
remarked
then
carelessly
and
with
the
calm
drawing
forth
of
a
folded
bit
of
paper
which
i
held
out
toward
him
i
added
by
the
way
here
is
something
of
yours
his
hand
rose
instinctively
to
take
it
then
dropped
i
do
know
what
you
mean
he
remarked
you
have
nothing
of
mine
no
then
john
judson
moore
had
another
brother
and
i
thrust
the
paper
back
into
my
pocket
he
followed
it
with
his
eye
it
was
the
memorandum
i
had
found
in
the
old
book
of
memoirs
plucked
from
the
library
shelf
within
and
he
recognized
it
for
his
and
saw
that
i
did
also
but
he
failed
to
show
the
white
feather
you
are
good
at
ransacking
he
observed
pity
that
it
can
not
be
done
to
more
purpose
i
smiled
and
made
a
fresh
start
with
my
hand
thrust
again
into
my
pocket
i
remarked
without
even
so
much
as
a
glance
at
him
i
fear
that
you
do
some
injustice
to
the
police
we
are
not
such
bad
fellows
neither
do
we
waste
as
much
time
as
you
seem
to
think
and
drawing
out
my
hand
with
the
little
filigree
ball
in
it
i
whirled
the
latter
innocently
round
and
round
on
my
finger
as
it
flashed
under
his
eye
i
cast
him
a
penetrating
look
he
tried
to
carry
the
moment
off
successfully
i
will
give
him
so
much
credit
but
it
was
asking
too
much
of
his
curiosity
and
there
was
no
mistaking
the
eager
glitter
which
lighted
his
glance
as
he
saw
within
his
reach
this
article
which
a
moment
before
he
had
probably
regarded
as
lost
forever
for
instance
i
went
on
watching
him
furtively
though
quite
sure
from
his
very
first
look
that
he
knew
no
more
now
of
the
secret
of
this
little
ball
than
he
knew
when
he
jotted
down
the
memorandum
i
had
just
pocketed
before
his
eyes
a
little
thing
such
a
little
thing
as
this
i
repeated
giving
the
bauble
another
twist
may
lead
to
discoveries
such
as
no
common
search
would
yield
in
years
i
do
not
say
that
it
has
but
such
a
thing
is
possible
you
know
who
better
my
nonchalance
was
too
much
for
him
he
surveyed
me
with
covert
dislike
and
dryly
observed
your
opportunities
have
exceeded
mine
even
with
my
own
effects
that
petty
trinket
which
you
have
presumed
to
flaunt
in
my
face
and
of
whose
value
i
am
the
worst
judge
in
the
world
since
i
have
never
had
it
in
my
hand
descended
to
me
with
the
rest
of
jeffrey
property
your
conduct
therefore
strikes
me
in
the
light
of
an
impertinence
especially
as
no
one
could
be
supposed
to
have
more
interest
than
myself
in
what
has
been
for
many
years
recognized
as
a
family
talisman
ah
i
remarked
you
own
to
the
memorandum
then
it
was
made
on
the
spot
but
without
the
benefit
of
the
talisman
i
own
to
nothing
he
snapped
then
realizing
that
denial
in
this
regard
was
fatal
he
added
more
genially
what
do
you
mean
by
memorandum
if
you
mean
that
recapitulation
of
mysteries
and
their
accompanying
features
with
which
i
once
whiled
away
an
idle
hour
i
own
to
it
of
course
why
should
i
it
is
only
a
proof
of
my
curiosity
in
regard
to
this
old
mystery
which
every
member
of
my
family
must
feel
that
curiosity
has
not
been
appeased
if
it
would
not
be
indiscreet
on
your
part
may
i
now
ask
if
you
have
found
out
what
that
little
golden
ball
of
mine
which
you
sport
so
freely
before
my
eyes
is
to
be
used
in
connection
with
read
the
papers
i
said
read
tomorrow
papers
moore
or
better
still
tonight
perhaps
they
will
inform
you
he
was
as
angry
as
i
had
expected
him
to
be
but
as
this
ire
proved
conclusively
that
his
strongest
emotion
had
been
curiosity
rather
than
fear
i
felt
assured
of
my
ground
and
turned
to
reenter
the
house
moore
did
not
accompany
me
the
major
was
standing
in
the
hall
the
others
had
evidently
retreated
to
the
parlor
the
man
opposite
knows
what
he
knows
said
i
but
this
does
not
include
the
facts
concerning
the
picture
in
the
southwest
chamber
or
the
devilish
mechanism
you
are
sure
as
positive
as
one
of
my
inexperience
can
be
but
major
i
am
equally
positive
that
he
knows
more
than
he
should
of
death
i
am
even
ready
to
state
that
in
my
belief
he
was
in
the
house
when
it
occurred
has
he
acknowledged
this
not
at
all
then
what
are
your
reasons
for
this
belief
they
are
many
will
you
state
them
gladly
if
you
will
pardon
the
presumption
some
of
my
conclusions
can
not
be
new
to
you
the
truth
is
that
i
have
possibly
seen
more
of
this
old
man
than
my
duty
warranted
and
i
feel
quite
ready
to
declare
that
he
knows
more
of
what
has
taken
place
in
this
house
than
he
is
ready
to
avow
i
am
sure
that
he
has
often
visited
it
in
secret
and
knows
about
a
certain
broken
window
as
well
as
we
do
i
am
also
sure
that
he
was
here
on
the
night
of
suicide
he
was
too
little
surprised
when
i
informed
him
of
what
had
happened
not
to
have
had
some
secret
inkling
of
it
beforehand
even
if
we
had
not
the
testimony
of
the
lighted
candle
and
the
book
he
so
hurriedly
replaced
besides
he
is
not
the
man
to
drag
himself
out
at
night
for
so
simple
a
cause
as
the
one
with
which
he
endeavored
to
impose
upon
us
he
knew
what
we
should
find
in
this
house
very
good
if
jeffrey
present
explanations
are
true
these
deductions
of
yours
are
probably
correct
but
moore
denial
has
been
positive
i
fear
that
it
will
turn
out
a
mere
question
of
veracity
not
necessarily
i
returned
i
think
i
see
a
way
of
forcing
this
man
to
acknowledge
that
he
was
in
or
about
this
house
on
that
fatal
night
you
do
yes
sir
i
do
not
want
to
boast
and
i
should
be
glad
if
you
did
not
oblige
me
to
confide
to
you
the
means
by
which
i
hope
to
bring
this
out
only
give
me
leave
to
insert
an
advertisement
in
both
evening
and
morning
papers
and
in
two
days
i
will
report
failure
or
success
the
major
eyed
me
with
an
interest
that
made
my
heart
thrill
then
he
quickly
said
you
have
earned
the
privilege
i
will
give
you
two
days
at
this
moment
durbin
reappeared
as
i
heard
his
knock
and
turned
to
open
the
door
for
him
i
cast
the
major
an
entreating
if
not
eloquent
look
he
smiled
and
waved
his
hand
with
friendly
assurance
the
state
of
feeling
between
durbin
and
myself
was
evidently
well
known
to
him
my
enemy
entered
with
a
jaunty
air
which
changed
ever
so
slightly
when
he
saw
me
in
close
conference
with
the
superintendent
he
had
the
book
in
his
pocket
taking
it
out
he
handed
it
to
the
major
with
this
remark
you
wo
find
anything
there
the
gent
been
fooling
you
the
major
opened
the
book
shook
it
looked
under
the
cover
found
nothing
and
crossed
hastily
to
the
we
as
hastily
followed
him
the
district
attorney
was
talking
with
miss
tuttle
jeffrey
was
nervously
pacing
the
floor
the
latter
stopped
as
we
all
entered
and
his
eyes
flashed
to
the
book
let
me
take
it
said
he
it
is
absolutely
empty
remarked
the
major
the
letter
has
been
abstracted
probably
without
your
knowledge
i
do
not
think
so
was
jeffrey
unexpected
retort
do
you
suppose
that
i
would
intrust
a
secret
for
the
preservation
of
which
i
was
ready
to
risk
life
and
honor
to
the
open
pages
of
a
book
when
i
found
myself
threatened
with
all
sorts
of
visits
from
the
police
and
realized
that
at
any
moment
my
effects
might
be
ransacked
i
sought
a
hiding
place
for
this
letter
which
no
man
without
superhuman
insight
could
discover
look
and
pulling
off
the
outside
wrapper
he
inserted
the
point
of
his
penknife
under
the
edge
of
the
paper
lining
the
inside
cover
and
ripped
it
off
with
a
jerk
i
pasted
this
here
myself
he
cried
and
showed
us
where
between
this
paper
and
the
boards
in
a
place
thinned
out
to
hold
it
there
lay
a
number
of
folded
sheets
which
with
a
deep
sigh
he
handed
over
to
the
major
inspection
as
he
did
so
he
remarked
i
had
rather
have
died
any
natural
death
than
have
had
my
miserable
wife
secret
known
but
since
the
crime
has
come
to
light
this
story
of
her
sin
and
her
repentance
may
serve
in
some
slight
degree
to
mitigate
public
opinion
she
was
sorely
tempted
and
she
succumbed
the
crime
of
her
ancestors
was
in
her
blood
he
again
walked
off
the
major
unfolded
the
sheets
xxv
who
will
tell
the
man
inside
there
later
i
saw
this
letter
it
was
like
no
other
that
has
ever
come
under
my
eye
written
at
intervals
as
her
hand
had
power
or
her
misery
found
words
it
bore
on
its
face
all
the
evidences
of
that
restless
suffering
spirit
which
for
hours
drove
her
in
frenzy
about
her
room
and
caused
loretta
to
say
in
her
effort
to
describe
her
mistress
face
as
it
appeared
to
her
at
the
end
of
this
awful
time
it
was
as
if
a
blight
had
passed
over
it
once
gay
and
animated
beyond
the
power
of
any
one
to
describe
it
had
become
a
ghost
face
with
the
glare
of
some
awful
resolve
upon
it
i
give
this
letter
just
as
it
was
paragraphs
broken
sentences
unfinished
words
and
all
the
breaks
show
where
she
laid
down
her
pen
possibly
for
that
wild
pacing
of
the
floor
which
left
such
unmistakable
signs
behind
it
it
opens
abruptly
i
killed
him
i
am
all
that
i
said
i
was
and
you
can
never
again
give
me
a
thought
save
in
the
way
of
cursing
and
to
bewail
the
day
i
came
into
your
life
but
you
can
not
hate
me
more
than
i
hate
myself
my
wicked
self
who
seeing
an
obstacle
in
the
way
to
happiness
stamped
it
out
of
existence
and
so
forfeited
all
right
to
happiness
forever
it
was
so
easy
had
it
been
a
hard
thing
to
do
had
it
been
necessary
to
lay
hand
on
knife
or
lift
a
pistol
i
might
have
realized
the
act
and
paused
but
just
a
little
spring
which
a
child
hand
could
manage
who
feeling
for
it
could
help
pressing
it
if
only
to
see
i
was
always
a
reckless
girl
mad
for
pleasure
and
without
any
thought
of
consequences
when
school
bored
me
i
took
all
my
books
out
of
my
desk
called
upon
my
mates
to
do
the
same
and
stacking
them
up
into
a
sort
of
rostrum
in
a
field
where
we
played
first
delivered
an
oration
from
them
in
which
reverence
for
my
teachers
had
small
part
then
tore
them
into
pieces
and
burned
them
in
full
sight
of
my
admiring
i
was
dismissed
but
not
with
disgrace
teachers
and
scholars
bewailed
my
departure
not
because
they
liked
me
or
because
of
any
good
they
had
found
in
me
but
because
my
money
had
thrown
luster
on
them
and
on
the
whole
establishment
this
was
when
i
was
twelve
and
it
was
on
account
of
this
reckless
escapade
that
i
was
sent
west
and
kept
so
long
from
home
and
all
my
flatterers
my
guardian
meant
well
by
this
but
in
saving
me
from
one
pitfall
he
plunged
me
into
another
i
grew
up
without
cora
and
also
without
any
idea
of
the
requirements
of
my
position
or
what
i
might
anticipate
from
the
world
when
the
time
came
for
me
to
enter
it
i
knew
that
i
had
money
so
did
those
about
me
but
i
had
little
or
no
idea
of
the
amount
nor
what
that
money
would
do
for
me
when
i
returned
to
washington
so
in
an
evil
day
and
when
i
was
just
eighteen
i
fell
in
love
or
thought
i
did
with
a
man
oh
francis
imagine
it
now
that
i
have
seen
you
of
sufficient
attraction
to
satisfy
one
whose
prospects
were
limited
to
a
contracted
existence
in
some
small
town
but
no
more
fitted
to
content
me
after
seeing
washington
life
than
if
he
had
been
a
common
farm
hand
or
the
most
ordinary
of
clerks
in
a
country
store
but
i
was
young
ignorant
and
and
thought
because
my
cheek
burned
under
his
look
that
he
was
the
man
of
men
and
suited
to
be
my
husband
that
is
if
i
thought
at
all
which
is
not
likely
for
i
was
in
a
feverish
whirl
and
just
followed
the
impulse
of
the
moment
which
was
to
be
with
him
whenever
i
could
without
attracting
the
teacher
attention
and
this
alas
was
only
too
often
for
he
was
the
brother
of
one
of
our
storekeepers
a
visitor
in
owosso
and
often
in
the
store
where
we
girls
went
why
the
teachers
did
not
notice
how
often
we
needed
things
there
i
do
not
know
but
they
did
not
and
matters
went
on
and
i
can
not
write
of
those
days
and
you
do
not
want
to
hear
about
them
they
seem
impossible
to
me
now
and
almost
as
if
it
had
all
happened
to
some
one
else
so
completely
have
i
forgotten
the
man
except
as
the
source
and
cause
of
an
immeasurable
horror
yet
he
was
not
bad
himself
only
ordinary
and
humdrum
indeed
i
believe
he
was
very
good
in
ways
or
so
his
brother
once
assured
me
we
would
not
have
been
married
in
the
way
we
were
if
he
had
not
wanted
to
go
to
the
klondike
for
the
purpose
of
making
money
and
making
it
quickly
so
that
his
means
might
match
mine
i
do
not
know
which
of
us
two
was
most
to
blame
for
that
marriage
he
urged
it
because
he
was
going
so
far
away
and
wanted
to
be
sure
of
me
i
accepted
it
because
it
seemed
to
be
romantic
and
because
it
pleased
me
to
have
my
own
way
in
spite
of
my
hard
old
guardian
and
the
teachers
who
were
always
prying
about
and
the
girls
who
went
silly
over
him
for
he
was
really
handsome
in
his
way
and
who
thought
at
least
many
of
them
did
that
he
cared
for
them
when
he
cared
only
for
me
i
have
hated
black
eyes
for
a
year
he
had
black
eyes
i
forgot
cora
or
rather
i
did
not
let
any
remembrance
of
her
hinder
me
she
was
a
very
shadowy
person
to
me
in
those
days
i
had
not
seen
her
since
we
were
both
children
and
as
for
her
letters
they
were
almost
a
bore
to
me
she
lived
such
a
different
life
from
mine
and
wrote
of
so
many
things
i
had
no
interest
in
on
my
knees
i
ask
her
pardon
now
i
never
understood
her
i
never
understood
myself
i
was
light
as
thistledown
and
blown
by
every
breeze
there
came
a
gust
one
day
which
blew
me
into
the
mouth
of
hell
i
am
hovering
there
yet
and
am
sinking
francis
sinking
save
me
i
love
you
i
i
it
was
all
planned
by
him
i
have
no
head
for
such
things
sadie
helped
him
sadie
was
my
friend
but
sadie
had
not
much
to
say
about
it
for
he
seemed
to
know
just
how
to
arrange
it
all
so
that
no
one
at
the
seminary
should
know
or
even
suspect
what
had
occurred
till
we
got
ready
to
tell
them
he
did
not
even
take
his
brother
into
his
confidence
for
wallace
kept
store
and
gossiped
very
much
with
his
customers
besides
he
was
very
busy
just
then
selling
out
for
he
was
going
to
the
klondike
with
william
and
he
had
too
much
on
his
mind
to
be
bothered
or
so
william
said
all
this
i
must
tell
you
or
you
will
never
understand
the
temptation
which
assailed
me
when
having
returned
to
washington
i
awoke
to
my
own
position
and
the
kind
of
men
whom
i
could
now
hope
to
meet
i
was
the
wife
oh
the
folly
of
it
but
this
was
known
to
so
few
and
those
were
so
far
removed
and
one
even
my
friend
sadie
being
dead
why
not
ignore
the
miserable
secret
ceremony
and
cheat
myself
into
believing
myself
free
and
enjoy
this
world
of
pleasure
and
fashion
as
cora
was
enjoying
it
and
trust
trust
what
why
the
klondike
that
of
men
why
should
it
swallow
one
more
oh
i
know
that
it
sounds
hateful
but
i
was
desperate
i
had
seen
you
i
had
one
letter
from
him
after
he
reached
alaska
but
that
was
before
i
left
owosso
i
never
got
another
and
i
never
wrote
to
him
he
told
me
not
to
do
so
until
he
could
send
me
word
how
and
where
to
write
but
when
these
directions
came
my
heart
had
changed
and
my
only
wish
was
to
forget
his
existence
and
i
did
forget
it
almost
i
rode
and
danced
with
you
and
went
hither
and
yon
lavishing
money
and
time
and
heart
on
the
frivolities
which
came
in
my
way
calling
myself
veronica
and
striving
by
these
means
to
crush
out
every
remembrance
of
the
days
when
i
was
known
as
antoinette
and
antoinette
only
for
the
klondike
was
far
and
its
weather
bitter
and
men
were
dying
there
every
day
and
no
letters
came
i
used
to
thank
god
for
this
and
i
need
not
think
not
yet
whither
i
was
tending
one
thing
only
made
me
recall
my
real
position
that
was
when
your
eyes
turned
on
mine
your
true
eyes
so
bright
with
confidence
and
pride
i
wanted
to
meet
them
full
and
when
i
could
not
i
suddenly
knew
why
and
suffered
do
you
remember
the
night
when
we
stood
together
on
the
balcony
at
the
ocean
view
house
and
you
laid
your
hand
on
my
arm
and
wondered
why
i
persisted
in
looking
at
the
moon
instead
of
into
your
expectant
face
it
was
because
the
music
then
being
played
within
recalled
another
night
and
the
pressure
of
another
hand
on
my
arm
a
hand
whose
touch
i
hoped
never
to
feel
again
but
which
at
that
moment
was
so
much
more
palpable
than
yours
that
i
came
near
screaming
aloud
and
telling
you
in
one
rush
of
maddened
emotion
my
whole
abominable
secret
i
did
not
accept
your
attentions
nor
agree
to
marry
you
without
a
struggle
you
know
that
you
can
tell
as
no
one
else
can
how
i
held
back
and
asked
for
time
and
still
for
time
thus
grieving
you
and
tearing
my
own
breast
till
a
day
came
you
remember
the
day
when
you
found
me
laughing
like
a
mad
woman
in
a
circle
of
astonished
friends
you
drew
me
aside
and
said
words
which
i
hardly
waited
for
you
to
finish
for
at
last
i
was
free
to
love
you
free
to
love
and
free
to
say
so
the
morning
paper
had
brought
news
a
telegraphic
despatch
from
seattle
told
how
a
man
had
struggled
into
nome
frozen
bleeding
and
without
accouterments
or
companion
it
was
with
difficulty
he
had
kept
his
feet
and
turned
in
at
the
first
tent
he
came
to
indeed
he
had
only
time
to
speak
his
name
before
he
fell
dead
this
name
was
what
made
this
despatch
important
to
me
it
was
william
pfeiffer
for
me
there
was
but
one
william
pfeiffer
in
the
klondike
my
husband
and
he
was
dead
that
was
why
you
found
me
laughing
but
not
in
mirth
i
am
not
so
bad
as
that
but
because
i
could
breathe
again
without
feeling
a
clutch
about
my
throat
i
did
not
know
till
then
how
nearly
i
had
been
stifled
we
were
not
long
in
marrying
after
that
i
was
terrified
at
delay
not
because
i
feared
any
contradiction
of
the
report
which
had
given
this
glorious
release
but
because
i
dreaded
lest
some
hint
of
my
early
folly
should
reach
you
and
dim
the
pride
with
which
you
regarded
me
i
wanted
to
feel
myself
yours
so
closely
and
so
dearly
that
you
would
not
mind
if
any
one
told
you
that
i
had
once
cared
or
thought
i
had
cared
for
another
the
week
of
our
marriage
came
i
was
mad
with
gaiety
and
ecstatic
with
hope
nothing
had
occurred
to
mar
my
prospects
no
letter
from
denver
no
memento
from
the
klondike
no
word
even
from
wallace
who
had
gone
north
with
his
brother
soon
i
should
be
called
wife
again
but
by
lips
i
loved
and
to
whose
language
my
heart
thrilled
the
past
always
vague
would
soon
be
no
more
than
a
forgotten
dream
an
episode
quite
closed
i
could
afford
from
this
moment
on
to
view
life
like
other
girls
and
rejoice
in
my
youth
and
the
love
which
every
day
was
becoming
more
and
more
to
me
but
god
had
his
eye
upon
me
and
in
the
midst
of
my
happiness
and
the
hurry
of
our
final
preparations
his
bolt
fell
it
struck
me
while
i
was
at
the
do
laugh
rather
shudder
at
the
dressmaker
shop
in
fourteenth
street
i
was
leaning
over
a
table
chattering
like
a
magpie
over
the
way
i
wanted
a
gown
trimmed
when
my
eye
fell
on
a
scrap
of
newspaper
in
which
something
had
come
rolled
to
madame
it
was
torn
at
the
edge
but
on
the
bit
lying
under
my
eyes
i
saw
my
husband
name
william
pfeiffer
and
that
the
paper
was
a
denver
one
there
was
but
one
william
pfeiffer
in
denver
and
he
was
my
husband
and
i
read
feeling
nothing
then
i
read
again
and
the
world
my
world
went
from
under
my
feet
for
the
man
who
had
fallen
dead
in
the
camp
at
nome
was
wallace
william
brother
and
not
william
himself
william
had
been
left
behind
on
the
road
by
his
more
energetic
brother
who
had
pushed
on
for
succor
through
the
worst
storm
and
under
the
worst
conditions
possible
even
in
that
region
with
the
lost
one
in
mind
the
one
word
that
wallace
uttered
in
sight
of
rescue
was
william
a
hope
was
expressed
of
finding
the
latter
alive
and
a
party
had
started
out
did
i
read
more
i
do
not
think
so
perhaps
there
was
no
more
to
read
here
was
where
the
paper
was
torn
across
but
it
was
no
matter
i
had
seen
enough
it
was
wallace
who
had
fallen
dead
and
while
william
might
have
perished
also
and
doubtless
had
i
had
no
certainty
of
it
and
my
wedding
day
was
set
for
thursday
why
did
i
tell
cora
why
did
i
tell
you
pride
held
my
tongue
besides
i
had
had
time
to
think
before
i
saw
either
of
you
and
to
reason
a
bit
and
to
feel
sure
that
if
wallace
had
been
spent
enough
to
fall
dead
on
reaching
the
camp
william
could
never
have
survived
on
the
open
road
for
wallace
was
the
stronger
of
the
two
and
the
most
hardy
every
way
free
i
certainly
was
some
later
paper
would
assure
me
of
this
i
would
hunt
them
up
and
see
but
i
never
did
i
do
not
think
i
dared
i
was
afraid
i
should
see
some
account
of
his
rescue
i
was
afraid
of
being
made
certain
of
what
was
now
but
a
possibility
and
so
i
did
nothing
but
for
three
nights
i
did
not
sleep
the
caprice
which
had
led
me
to
choose
the
old
moore
house
to
be
married
in
led
me
to
plan
dressing
there
on
my
wedding
morning
it
was
early
when
we
started
cora
and
i
for
waverley
avenue
but
not
too
early
for
the
approaches
to
that
dreadful
house
to
be
crowded
with
people
eager
to
see
the
daring
bride
why
i
should
have
shrunk
so
from
that
crowd
i
can
not
say
i
trembled
at
sight
of
their
faces
and
at
the
sound
of
their
voices
and
if
by
chance
a
head
was
thrust
forward
farther
than
the
rest
i
cowered
back
instinctively
and
nearly
screamed
did
i
dread
to
recognize
a
too
familiar
face
the
paper
i
had
seen
bore
a
date
six
months
back
a
man
could
arrive
here
from
alaska
in
that
time
or
was
my
conscience
aroused
at
last
and
clamoring
to
be
heard
when
it
was
too
late
on
the
corner
of
n
street
the
carriage
suddenly
stopped
a
man
had
crossed
in
front
of
it
i
caught
one
glimpse
of
this
man
and
instantly
the
terrors
of
a
lifetime
were
concentrated
into
one
instant
of
agonizing
fear
it
was
william
pfeiffer
i
knew
the
look
i
knew
the
gait
he
was
gone
in
a
moment
and
the
carriage
rolled
on
but
i
knew
my
doom
as
well
that
minute
as
i
did
an
hour
later
my
husband
was
alive
and
he
was
here
he
had
escaped
the
perils
of
the
klondike
and
wandered
east
to
reclaim
his
recreant
wife
there
had
been
time
for
him
to
do
this
since
the
rescue
party
left
home
in
search
of
him
time
for
him
to
recover
time
for
him
to
reach
home
time
for
him
to
reach
the
east
he
had
heard
of
my
wedding
it
was
in
all
the
papers
and
i
should
find
him
at
the
house
when
i
got
there
and
you
would
know
and
cora
would
know
and
the
wedding
would
stop
and
my
name
be
made
a
the
world
over
instead
of
the
joy
awaiting
me
a
moment
since
i
should
have
to
go
away
with
him
into
some
wilderness
or
distant
place
of
exile
where
my
maiden
name
would
never
be
heard
and
all
the
memories
of
this
year
of
stolen
delights
be
effaced
oh
it
was
horrible
and
all
in
a
minute
and
cora
sat
there
pale
calm
and
beautiful
as
an
angel
beaming
on
me
with
tender
eyes
whose
expression
i
have
never
understood
hell
in
my
heart
and
she
in
happy
ignorance
of
this
brooding
over
my
joy
and
smiling
to
herself
while
the
soft
tears
rose
you
were
waiting
at
the
curb
when
i
arrived
and
i
remember
how
my
heart
stood
still
when
you
laid
your
hand
on
the
carriage
door
and
confronted
me
with
that
light
on
your
face
i
had
never
seen
disturbed
since
we
first
pledged
ourselves
to
marry
would
he
see
it
too
and
come
forward
from
the
secret
place
where
he
held
himself
hidden
was
i
destined
to
behold
a
struggle
in
the
streets
an
unseemly
contest
of
words
in
sight
of
the
door
i
had
expected
to
enter
so
joyously
in
terror
of
such
an
event
i
seized
the
hand
which
seemed
my
one
refuge
in
this
hour
of
mortal
trouble
and
hastened
into
the
house
which
for
all
its
doleful
history
had
never
received
within
its
doors
a
heart
more
burdened
or
rebellious
as
this
thought
rushed
over
me
i
came
near
crying
out
house
of
doom
the
house
of
doom
i
had
thought
to
brave
its
terrors
and
its
crimes
and
it
has
avenged
itself
but
instead
of
that
i
pressed
your
hand
with
mine
and
smiled
o
god
if
you
could
have
seen
what
lay
beneath
that
smile
for
with
my
entrance
beneath
those
fatal
doors
a
thought
had
come
i
remembered
my
heritage
i
remembered
how
i
had
been
told
by
my
father
when
i
was
a
very
little
girl
i
presume
when
he
first
felt
the
hand
of
death
upon
him
that
if
ever
i
was
in
great
trouble
very
great
trouble
he
had
said
where
no
deliverance
seemed
possible
i
was
to
open
a
little
golden
ball
which
he
showed
me
and
take
out
what
i
should
find
inside
and
hold
it
close
up
before
a
picture
which
had
hung
from
time
immemorial
in
the
southwest
corner
of
this
old
house
he
could
not
tell
me
what
i
should
encounter
there
this
i
remember
his
saying
but
something
that
would
assist
me
something
which
had
passed
with
good
effect
from
father
down
to
child
for
many
generations
only
if
i
would
be
blessed
in
my
undertakings
i
must
not
open
the
golden
ball
nor
endeavor
to
find
out
its
mystery
unless
my
trouble
threatened
death
or
some
great
disaster
such
a
trouble
had
indeed
come
to
me
and
startling
coincidence
i
was
at
this
moment
in
the
very
house
where
this
picture
hung
and
more
startling
fact
yet
the
golden
ball
needed
to
interpret
its
meaning
was
round
my
neck
for
with
such
jealousy
was
this
family
trinket
always
guarded
by
its
owner
why
then
not
test
their
combined
effect
i
certainly
needed
help
from
some
quarter
never
would
william
allow
me
to
be
married
to
another
while
he
lived
he
would
yet
appear
and
i
should
need
thus
great
assistance
great
enough
to
be
transmitted
from
father
to
son
as
none
of
the
moores
had
needed
it
yet
though
what
it
was
i
did
not
know
and
did
not
even
try
to
guess
yet
when
i
got
to
the
room
i
did
not
drag
out
the
filigree
ball
at
once
nor
even
take
more
than
one
fearful
look
at
the
picture
in
drawing
off
my
glove
i
had
seen
his
ring
the
ring
you
had
once
asked
about
it
was
such
a
cheap
affair
the
only
one
he
could
get
in
that
obscure
little
town
where
we
were
married
i
lied
when
you
asked
me
if
it
was
a
family
jewel
lied
but
did
not
take
it
off
perhaps
because
it
clung
so
tightly
as
if
in
remembrance
of
the
vows
it
symbolized
but
now
the
very
sight
of
it
gave
me
a
fright
with
his
ring
on
my
finger
i
could
not
defy
him
and
swear
his
claim
to
be
false
the
dream
of
a
man
maddened
by
his
experiences
in
the
klondike
it
must
come
off
then
perhaps
i
should
feel
myself
a
free
woman
but
it
would
not
come
off
i
struggled
with
it
and
tugged
in
vain
then
i
bethought
me
of
using
a
nail
file
to
sever
it
this
i
did
grinding
and
grinding
at
it
till
the
ring
finally
broke
and
i
could
wrench
it
off
and
cast
it
away
out
of
sight
and
as
i
hoped
out
of
my
memory
also
i
breathed
easier
when
rid
of
this
token
yet
choked
with
terror
whenever
a
step
approached
the
door
i
was
clad
in
my
bridal
dress
but
not
in
my
bridal
veil
or
ornaments
and
naturally
cora
and
then
my
maid
came
to
assist
me
but
i
would
not
let
them
in
i
was
set
upon
testing
the
secret
of
the
filigree
ball
and
so
preparing
myself
for
what
my
conscience
told
me
lay
between
me
and
the
ceremony
arranged
for
high
noon
i
did
not
guess
that
the
studying
out
of
that
picture
would
take
so
long
the
contents
of
the
ball
turned
out
to
be
a
small
and
the
picture
a
maze
of
written
words
i
did
not
decipher
it
all
i
did
not
decipher
the
half
i
did
not
need
to
a
spirit
of
divination
was
given
me
in
that
awful
hour
which
enabled
me
to
grasp
its
full
meaning
from
the
few
sentences
i
did
pick
out
and
that
meaning
it
was
horrible
inconceivable
murder
was
taught
but
murder
from
a
distance
and
by
an
act
too
simple
to
awake
revulsion
were
the
wraiths
of
my
two
ancestors
who
had
played
with
the
spring
hidden
in
the
depths
of
this
old
closet
drawn
up
in
mockery
beside
me
during
the
hour
when
i
stood
spellbound
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
thinking
of
what
i
had
just
read
and
listening
listening
for
something
less
loud
than
the
sound
of
carriages
now
beginning
to
roll
up
in
front
or
the
stray
notes
of
the
band
tuning
up
below
less
loud
but
meaning
what
a
step
into
the
empty
closet
yawning
so
near
an
effort
with
a
drawer
a
a
do
not
ask
me
to
recall
it
i
did
not
shudder
when
the
moment
came
and
i
stood
there
then
i
was
cold
as
marble
but
i
shudder
now
in
thinking
of
it
till
soul
and
body
seem
separating
and
the
horror
which
envelopes
me
gives
me
such
a
foretaste
of
hell
that
i
wonder
i
can
contemplate
the
deed
which
if
it
releases
me
from
this
earthly
anguish
will
only
plunge
me
into
a
possibly
worse
hereafter
yet
i
shall
surely
take
my
life
before
you
see
me
again
and
in
that
old
house
if
it
is
despair
i
feel
then
despair
will
take
me
there
if
it
is
repentance
then
repentance
will
suffice
to
drive
me
to
the
one
expiation
possible
to
me
to
perish
where
i
caused
an
innocent
man
to
perish
and
so
relieve
you
of
a
wife
who
was
never
worthy
of
you
and
whom
it
would
be
your
duty
to
denounce
if
she
let
another
sun
rise
upon
her
guilt
i
did
not
stand
there
long
between
the
wraiths
of
my
murderous
ancestors
a
message
was
shouted
through
the
door
the
message
for
which
my
ears
had
been
strained
in
dreadful
anticipation
for
the
last
two
hours
a
man
named
pfeiffer
wanted
to
see
me
before
i
went
down
to
be
married
a
man
named
pfeiffer
i
looked
closely
at
the
boy
who
delivered
this
message
he
showed
no
excitement
nor
any
feeling
greater
than
impatience
at
being
kept
waiting
a
minute
or
so
at
the
door
then
i
glanced
beyond
him
at
the
people
chatting
in
the
hall
no
alarm
there
nothing
but
a
very
natural
surprise
that
the
bride
should
keep
so
big
a
crowd
waiting
i
felt
that
this
fixed
the
event
he
who
had
sent
me
this
quiet
message
was
true
to
himself
and
to
our
old
compact
he
had
not
published
below
what
would
have
set
the
house
in
an
uproar
in
a
moment
he
had
left
his
secret
to
be
breathed
into
my
ear
alone
i
could
recall
the
moment
he
passed
me
his
word
and
his
firm
look
as
he
said
with
his
hand
lifted
to
heaven
have
been
good
to
me
and
given
me
your
precious
self
while
i
was
poor
and
a
nobody
in
return
i
swear
to
keep
our
marriage
a
secret
till
great
success
shows
me
to
be
worthy
of
you
or
till
you
with
your
own
lips
express
forgiveness
of
my
failure
and
grant
me
leave
to
speak
nothing
but
death
or
your
permission
shall
ever
unseal
my
lips
when
i
heard
that
he
was
dead
i
feared
lest
he
might
have
spoken
but
now
that
i
had
seen
him
alive
i
knew
that
in
no
other
breast
save
his
my
own
and
that
of
the
unknown
minister
in
an
almost
unknown
town
dwelt
any
knowledge
of
the
fact
which
stood
between
me
and
the
marriage
which
all
these
people
had
come
here
to
see
my
confidence
in
his
rectitude
determined
me
without
conscious
emotion
without
fear
even
the
ending
of
suspense
had
ended
all
that
i
told
the
boy
to
seat
the
gentleman
in
the
library
then
i
am
haunted
now
i
am
haunted
always
by
one
vision
horrible
but
persistent
it
will
not
leave
me
it
rises
between
us
now
it
has
stood
between
us
ever
since
i
left
that
house
with
the
seal
of
your
affection
on
my
lips
last
night
it
terrified
me
into
unconscious
speech
i
dreamed
that
i
saw
again
and
plainly
what
i
caught
but
a
shadowy
glimpse
of
in
that
murderous
hour
a
man
form
seated
at
the
end
of
the
old
settle
with
his
head
leaning
back
in
silent
contemplation
his
face
was
turned
the
other
way
i
thanked
god
for
that
no
i
did
not
thank
god
i
never
thought
of
god
in
that
moment
of
my
blind
feeling
about
for
a
chink
and
a
spring
in
the
wall
i
thought
only
of
your
impatience
and
the
people
waiting
and
the
pleasure
of
days
to
come
when
free
from
this
intolerable
bond
i
could
keep
my
place
at
your
side
and
bear
your
name
unreproved
and
taste
to
the
full
the
awe
and
delight
of
a
passion
such
as
few
women
ever
feel
because
few
women
were
ever
loved
by
a
man
like
you
had
my
thoughts
been
elsewhere
my
fingers
might
have
forgotten
to
fumble
along
that
wall
and
i
had
been
simply
wretched
and
innocent
innocent
o
where
in
universe
can
i
be
made
innocent
again
and
fit
to
look
in
your
face
and
to
love
thought
even
to
love
you
again
to
turn
and
turn
a
miserable
crank
after
those
moments
of
frenzied
action
and
silence
that
was
the
hard
was
what
tried
my
nerve
and
first
robbed
me
of
calmness
but
i
dared
not
leave
that
fearful
thing
dangling
there
i
had
to
wind
the
machinery
squeaked
and
its
noise
seemed
to
fill
the
house
but
no
one
came
nor
did
the
door
below
open
sometimes
i
have
wished
that
it
had
i
should
not
then
have
been
lured
on
and
you
would
not
have
become
involved
in
my
ruin
i
have
heard
many
say
that
i
looked
radiant
when
i
came
down
to
be
married
the
radiance
was
in
their
thoughts
or
if
my
face
did
shine
and
if
i
moved
as
if
treading
on
air
it
was
because
i
had
triumphed
over
all
difficulties
and
could
pass
down
to
the
altar
without
fear
of
that
interrupting
voice
crying
out
forbid
she
is
mine
the
wife
of
william
pfeiffer
can
not
wed
another
no
such
words
could
be
dreaded
now
the
lips
which
might
have
spoken
them
were
dumb
i
forgot
that
fleshless
lips
gibber
loudest
and
that
a
lifetime
long
or
short
lay
before
me
in
which
to
hear
them
mumble
and
squeak
their
denunciation
and
threats
oh
but
i
have
been
wretched
at
ball
and
dinner
and
dance
those
lips
have
been
ever
at
my
ear
but
most
when
we
have
sat
alone
together
most
then
oh
most
then
he
is
avenged
but
you
who
will
avenge
you
and
where
will
you
ever
find
happiness
to
blot
myself
from
your
memory
i
would
go
down
deeper
into
the
vale
of
suffering
than
ever
i
have
gone
yet
but
no
no
do
not
quite
forget
me
remember
me
as
you
saw
me
one
night
the
night
you
took
the
flower
out
of
my
hair
and
kissed
it
saying
that
washington
held
many
beautiful
women
but
that
none
of
them
save
myself
had
ever
had
the
power
to
move
your
inmost
ah
low
was
your
voice
and
eloquent
your
eyes
that
hour
and
i
forgot
for
a
moment
i
forgot
everything
but
this
pure
love
and
the
heartbeat
it
called
up
and
the
hope
never
to
be
realized
that
i
should
live
to
hear
you
repeat
the
same
sweet
words
in
our
old
age
in
just
such
a
tone
and
with
just
such
a
look
i
was
innocent
at
that
moment
innocent
and
good
i
am
willing
that
you
should
remember
me
as
i
was
that
night
when
i
think
of
him
lying
cold
and
dead
in
the
grave
i
myself
dug
for
him
my
heart
is
like
stone
but
when
i
think
of
you
i
am
afraid
to
die
but
i
am
more
afraid
of
failing
in
courage
i
shall
have
the
pistol
tied
to
me
this
will
make
it
seem
inevitable
to
use
it
oh
that
the
next
hours
could
be
blotted
out
of
time
such
horror
can
not
be
i
was
born
for
joy
and
gaiety
yet
no
dismal
depth
of
misery
and
fear
has
been
spared
me
but
all
on
account
of
my
own
act
i
do
not
accuse
god
i
do
not
accuse
man
i
only
accuse
myself
and
my
thoughtless
grasping
after
pleasure
i
want
cora
to
read
this
as
well
as
you
she
must
know
me
dead
as
she
never
knew
me
living
but
i
can
not
tell
her
that
i
have
left
a
confession
behind
me
she
must
come
upon
it
unexpectedly
just
as
i
mean
you
to
do
only
thus
can
it
reach
either
of
you
with
any
power
if
i
could
but
think
of
some
excuse
for
sending
her
to
the
book
where
i
propose
to
hide
it
that
would
give
her
a
chance
of
reading
it
before
you
do
and
this
would
be
best
she
may
know
how
to
prepare
or
comfort
you
i
hope
so
cora
is
a
noble
woman
but
the
secret
which
kept
my
thoughts
in
such
a
whirl
has
held
us
apart
you
did
what
i
asked
you
found
a
place
for
rancher
waiter
in
the
volunteer
corps
surprised
as
you
were
at
the
interest
i
expressed
in
him
you
honored
my
first
request
and
said
nothing
would
you
have
shown
the
same
anxious
eagerness
if
you
had
known
why
i
whispered
those
few
words
to
him
from
the
carriage
door
why
i
could
neither
rest
nor
sleep
till
he
and
the
other
boy
were
safely
out
of
town
i
must
leave
a
line
for
you
to
show
to
people
if
they
should
wonder
why
i
killed
myself
so
soon
after
my
seemingly
happy
marriage
you
will
find
it
in
the
same
book
with
this
letter
some
one
will
tell
you
to
look
in
the
book
i
can
not
write
any
more
i
can
not
help
writing
it
is
all
that
connects
me
now
with
life
and
with
you
but
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
except
forgive
forgive
do
you
think
that
god
looks
at
his
wretched
ones
differently
from
what
men
do
that
he
will
have
tenderness
for
one
so
sorry
that
he
will
even
find
place
but
my
mother
is
there
my
father
oh
that
makes
it
fearful
to
go
to
meet
but
it
was
my
father
who
led
me
into
this
only
he
did
not
know
there
i
will
think
only
of
god
good
by
good
by
good
that
was
all
it
ended
as
it
began
without
name
and
without
date
the
final
of
a
soul
awakened
to
its
own
act
when
it
was
quite
too
late
a
piteous
memorial
which
daunted
each
one
of
us
as
we
read
it
and
when
finished
drew
us
all
together
in
the
hall
out
of
the
sight
and
hearing
of
the
two
persons
most
intimately
concerned
in
it
possibly
because
all
had
one
thought
a
thrilling
one
which
the
major
was
the
first
to
give
utterance
to
the
man
she
killed
was
buried
under
the
name
of
wallace
that
if
he
was
her
husband
william
an
officer
we
had
not
before
noted
was
standing
near
the
front
door
he
came
forward
at
this
and
placed
a
second
telegram
in
the
superintendent
hand
it
was
from
the
same
source
as
the
one
previously
received
and
appeared
to
settle
this
very
question
i
have
just
learned
that
the
man
married
was
not
the
one
who
kept
store
in
owosso
but
his
brother
william
who
afterward
died
in
klondike
it
is
wallace
whose
death
you
are
investigating
what
snarl
is
here
asked
the
major
i
think
i
understand
i
ventured
to
put
in
her
husband
was
the
one
left
on
the
road
by
the
brother
who
staggered
into
camp
for
aid
he
was
a
weak
man
the
weaker
of
the
two
she
said
and
probably
died
while
wallace
after
seemingly
collapsing
recovered
this
last
she
did
not
know
having
failed
to
read
the
whole
of
the
newspaper
slip
which
told
about
it
and
so
when
she
saw
some
one
with
the
pfeiffer
air
and
figure
and
was
told
later
that
a
pfeiffer
was
waiting
to
see
her
she
took
it
for
granted
that
it
was
her
husband
believing
positively
that
wallace
was
dead
the
latter
moreover
may
have
changed
to
look
more
like
his
brother
in
the
time
that
had
elapsed
a
possible
explanation
which
adds
greatly
to
the
tragic
aspects
of
the
situation
she
was
probably
a
widow
when
she
touched
the
fatal
spring
who
will
tell
the
man
inside
there
it
will
be
his
crowning
blow
xxvi
rudge
i
never
saw
any
good
reason
for
my
changing
the
opinion
just
expressed
indeed
as
time
went
on
and
a
further
investigation
was
made
into
the
life
and
character
of
these
two
brothers
i
came
to
think
that
not
only
had
the
unhappy
veronica
mistaken
the
person
of
wallace
pfeiffer
for
that
of
her
husband
william
but
also
the
nature
of
the
message
he
sent
her
and
the
motives
which
actuated
it
that
the
interview
he
so
peremptorily
demanded
before
she
descended
to
her
nuptials
would
had
she
but
understood
it
properly
have
yielded
her
an
immeasurable
satisfaction
instead
of
rousing
in
her
alarmed
breast
the
criminal
instincts
of
her
race
that
it
was
meant
to
do
this
that
he
knowing
william
secret
a
secret
which
the
latter
naturally
would
confide
to
him
at
a
moment
so
critical
as
that
which
witnessed
their
parting
in
the
desolate
klondike
pass
had
come
not
to
reproach
her
with
her
new
nuptials
but
to
relieve
her
mind
in
case
she
cherished
the
least
doubt
of
her
full
right
to
marry
again
by
assurances
of
her
husband
death
and
of
her
own
complete
freedom
to
this
he
may
have
intended
to
add
some
final
messages
of
love
and
confidence
from
the
man
she
had
been
so
ready
to
forget
but
nothing
worse
wallace
pfeiffer
was
incapable
of
anything
worse
and
if
she
had
only
resigned
herself
to
her
seeming
fate
and
consented
to
see
this
man
but
to
return
to
fact
and
leave
speculation
to
the
now
doubly
wretched
jeffrey
on
the
evening
of
the
day
which
saw
our
first
recognition
of
this
crime
as
the
work
of
veronica
moore
the
following
notice
appeared
in
the
star
and
all
the
other
local
journals
any
person
who
positively
remembers
passing
through
waverley
avenue
between
n
and
m
streets
on
the
evening
of
may
the
eleventh
at
or
near
the
hour
of
a
quarter
past
seven
will
confer
a
favor
on
the
detective
force
of
the
district
by
communicating
the
same
to
at
the
police
headquarters
in
c
street
i
was
and
i
was
soon
deep
in
business
but
i
was
readily
able
to
identify
those
who
came
from
curiosity
and
as
the
persons
who
had
really
fulfilled
the
conditions
expressed
in
my
advertisement
were
few
an
evening
and
morning
work
sufficed
to
sift
the
whole
matter
down
to
the
one
man
who
could
tell
me
just
what
i
wanted
to
know
with
this
man
i
went
to
the
major
and
as
a
result
we
all
met
later
in
the
day
at
moore
door
this
gentleman
looked
startled
enough
when
he
saw
the
number
and
character
of
his
visitors
but
his
grand
air
did
not
forsake
him
and
his
welcome
was
both
dignified
and
cordial
but
i
did
not
like
the
way
his
eye
rested
on
me
but
the
slight
venom
visible
in
it
at
that
moment
was
nothing
to
what
he
afterwards
displayed
when
at
a
slight
growl
from
rudge
who
stood
in
an
attitude
of
offense
in
the
doorway
beyond
i
drew
the
attention
of
all
to
the
dog
by
saying
sharply
there
is
our
witness
sirs
there
is
the
dog
who
will
not
cross
the
street
even
when
his
master
calls
him
but
crouches
on
the
edge
of
the
curb
and
waits
with
eager
eyes
but
immovable
body
till
that
master
comes
back
is
that
so
moore
have
i
not
heard
you
utter
more
than
one
complaint
in
this
regard
i
can
not
deny
it
was
the
stiff
reply
but
what
i
did
not
wait
for
him
to
finish
correan
i
asked
is
this
the
animal
you
gassed
between
the
hours
of
seven
and
eight
on
the
evening
of
may
the
eleventh
crouching
in
front
of
this
house
with
his
nose
to
the
curbstone
it
is
i
noted
him
particularly
he
seemed
to
be
watching
the
opposite
house
instantly
i
turned
upon
moore
is
rudge
the
dog
to
do
that
i
asked
if
his
master
were
not
there
twice
have
i
myself
seen
him
in
the
place
and
with
the
air
of
expectant
attention
and
both
times
you
had
crossed
to
the
house
which
you
acknowledge
he
will
approach
no
nearer
than
the
curb
on
this
side
of
the
street
you
have
me
was
the
short
reply
with
which
moore
gave
up
the
struggle
rudge
go
back
to
your
place
when
you
are
wanted
in
the
i
will
let
you
know
the
smile
with
which
he
said
this
was
sarcastic
enough
but
it
was
sarcasm
directed
mainly
against
himself
we
were
not
surprised
when
after
some
sharp
persuasion
on
the
part
of
the
major
he
launched
into
the
following
recital
of
his
secret
relation
to
what
he
called
the
last
tragedy
ever
likely
to
occur
in
the
moore
family
i
never
thought
it
wrong
to
be
curious
about
the
old
place
i
never
thought
it
wrong
to
be
curious
about
its
mysteries
i
only
considered
it
wrong
or
at
all
events
ill
judged
to
annoy
veronica
in
regard
to
them
or
to
trouble
her
in
any
way
about
the
means
by
which
i
might
effect
an
entrance
into
its
walls
so
i
took
the
one
that
offered
and
said
nothing
i
have
visited
the
old
house
many
times
during
my
sojourn
in
this
little
cottage
the
last
time
was
as
one
of
your
number
has
so
ably
discovered
on
the
most
memorable
night
in
its
history
the
one
in
which
jeffrey
remarkable
death
occurred
there
the
interest
roused
in
me
by
the
unexpected
recurrence
of
the
old
fatality
attending
the
library
hearthstone
reached
its
culmination
when
i
perceived
one
night
the
glint
of
a
candle
burning
in
the
southwest
chamber
i
did
not
know
who
was
responsible
for
this
light
but
i
strongly
suspected
it
to
be
jeffrey
for
who
else
would
dare
to
light
a
candle
in
this
disused
house
without
first
seeing
that
all
the
shutters
were
fast
i
did
not
dislike
jeffrey
or
question
his
right
to
do
this
nevertheless
i
was
very
angry
though
allied
to
a
moore
he
was
not
one
himself
and
the
difference
in
our
privileges
affected
me
strongly
consequently
i
watched
till
he
came
out
and
upon
positively
recognizing
his
figure
vowed
in
my
wrath
and
jealous
indignation
to
visit
the
old
house
myself
on
the
following
night
and
make
one
final
attempt
to
learn
the
secret
which
would
again
make
me
the
equal
of
this
man
if
not
his
superior
it
was
early
when
i
went
indeed
it
was
not
quite
dark
but
knowing
the
gloom
of
those
old
halls
and
the
almost
impenetrable
nature
of
the
darkness
that
settles
over
the
library
the
moment
the
twilight
set
in
i
put
in
my
pocket
two
or
three
candles
sirs
about
which
you
have
made
such
a
coil
my
errand
was
twofold
i
wanted
first
to
see
what
jeffrey
had
been
up
to
the
night
before
and
next
to
spend
an
hour
over
a
certain
book
of
old
memoirs
which
in
recalling
the
past
might
explain
the
present
you
remember
a
door
leading
into
the
library
from
the
rear
room
it
was
by
this
door
i
entered
bringing
with
me
from
the
kitchen
the
chair
you
afterwards
found
there
i
knew
where
the
volume
of
memoirs
i
speak
of
was
to
be
found
you
do
too
i
see
for
it
was
my
hand
which
had
placed
it
in
its
present
concealment
quite
determined
to
reread
such
portions
of
it
as
i
had
long
before
marked
as
pertinent
to
the
very
attempt
i
had
in
mind
i
brought
in
the
candelabrum
from
the
parlor
and
drew
out
a
table
to
hold
it
but
i
waited
a
few
moments
before
taking
down
the
book
itself
i
wanted
first
to
learn
what
jeffrey
had
been
doing
upstairs
the
night
before
so
leaving
the
light
burning
in
the
library
i
proceeded
to
the
southwest
chamber
holding
an
unlit
candle
in
my
hand
the
light
feebly
diffused
through
the
halls
from
some
upper
windows
being
sufficient
for
me
to
see
my
way
but
in
the
chamber
itself
all
was
dark
the
wind
had
not
yet
risen
and
the
shutter
which
a
later
moved
so
restlessly
on
its
creaking
hinges
hugged
the
window
so
tightly
that
i
imagined
jeffrey
had
fastened
it
the
night
before
looking
for
some
receptacle
in
which
to
set
the
candle
i
now
lit
i
failed
to
find
anything
but
an
empty
tumbler
so
i
made
use
of
that
then
i
glanced
about
me
but
seeing
nothing
worth
my
attention
jeffrey
wedding
fixings
did
not
interest
me
and
everything
else
about
the
room
looking
natural
except
the
overturned
chair
which
struck
me
as
immaterial
i
hurried
downstairs
again
leaving
the
candle
burning
behind
me
in
case
i
should
wish
to
return
aloft
after
i
had
refreshed
my
mind
with
what
had
been
written
about
this
old
room
not
a
sound
disturbed
the
house
as
i
seated
myself
to
my
reading
in
front
of
the
library
shelves
i
was
as
much
alone
under
that
desolate
roof
as
mortal
could
be
with
men
anywhere
within
reach
of
him
i
enjoyed
the
solitude
and
was
making
a
very
pretty
theory
for
myself
on
a
scrap
of
paper
i
tore
from
another
old
book
when
a
noise
suddenly
rose
in
front
which
slight
as
it
was
was
quite
unmistakable
to
ears
trained
in
listening
some
one
was
unlocking
the
front
door
naturally
i
thought
it
to
be
jeffrey
returning
for
a
second
visit
to
his
wife
house
and
knowing
what
i
might
expect
if
he
surprised
me
on
the
premises
i
restored
the
book
hastily
to
its
place
and
as
hastily
blew
out
the
candle
then
with
every
intention
of
flight
i
backed
toward
the
door
by
which
i
had
entered
but
some
impulse
stronger
than
that
of
escape
made
me
stop
just
before
i
reached
it
i
could
see
nothing
the
place
was
dark
as
tophet
but
i
could
listen
the
person
jeffrey
or
some
other
was
coming
my
way
and
in
perfect
darkness
i
could
hear
the
faltering
steps
the
fingers
dragging
along
the
walls
then
a
rustle
as
of
skirts
proving
the
intruder
to
be
a
woman
a
fact
which
greatly
surprised
me
then
a
long
drawn
sigh
or
gasp
the
last
determined
me
the
situation
was
too
intense
for
me
to
leave
without
first
learning
who
the
woman
was
who
in
terror
and
shrinking
dared
to
drag
her
half
resisting
feet
through
these
empty
halls
and
into
a
place
cursed
with
such
unwholesome
memories
i
did
not
think
of
veronica
no
one
looks
for
a
butterfly
in
the
depths
of
a
dungeon
but
i
did
think
of
miss
tuttle
that
woman
of
resolute
will
without
attempting
to
imaging
the
reason
for
her
presence
i
stood
my
ground
and
harkened
till
the
heavy
mahogany
door
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
began
to
swing
in
by
jerks
under
the
faint
and
tremulous
push
of
a
terrified
hand
then
there
came
silence
a
long
silence
followed
by
a
moan
so
agonized
that
i
realized
that
whatever
was
the
cause
of
this
panting
presence
here
it
was
due
to
no
mere
errand
of
curiosity
this
whetted
my
purpose
anything
done
in
this
house
was
in
a
way
done
to
me
so
i
remained
quiet
and
watched
but
the
sounds
which
now
and
then
came
from
the
remote
corner
upon
which
my
attention
was
concentrated
were
very
eloquent
i
heard
sighs
and
bitter
groans
with
now
and
then
a
murmured
prayer
broken
by
a
low
wailing
in
which
i
caught
the
name
of
francis
and
still
possibly
on
account
of
the
utterance
of
this
name
i
thought
the
woman
near
me
to
be
miss
tuttle
and
even
went
so
far
as
to
imagine
the
cause
of
her
suffering
if
not
the
nature
of
her
retribution
words
succeeded
cries
and
i
caught
phrases
expressive
of
fear
and
some
sort
of
agonized
hesitation
once
these
broken
ejaculations
were
interrupted
by
a
dull
sound
something
had
dropped
to
the
bare
floor
we
shall
never
know
what
it
was
but
i
have
no
doubt
that
it
was
the
pistol
and
that
the
marks
of
dust
to
be
found
on
the
connecting
ribbon
were
made
by
her
own
fingers
in
taking
it
again
in
her
hand
you
will
remember
that
these
same
fingers
had
but
a
few
minutes
previous
groped
their
way
along
the
walls
for
her
voice
soon
took
a
different
tone
and
such
unintelligible
phrases
as
these
could
be
heard
issuing
from
her
partly
paralyzed
lips
must
i
can
never
meet
his
eye
again
alive
he
would
despise
brave
enough
to
to
another
blood
coward
when
own
oh
god
forgive
then
another
silence
during
which
i
almost
made
up
my
mind
to
interfere
then
a
loud
report
and
a
flash
so
startling
and
unexpected
that
i
recoiled
during
which
the
room
leaped
into
sudden
view
she
too
veronica
with
baby
face
drawn
and
set
like
a
woman
then
darkness
again
and
a
heavy
fall
which
shook
the
floor
if
not
my
hard
old
heart
the
flash
and
that
fall
enlightened
me
i
had
just
witnessed
the
suicide
of
the
last
moore
saving
myself
a
suicide
for
which
i
was
totally
unprepared
and
one
which
i
do
not
yet
understand
i
did
not
go
over
to
her
she
was
as
dead
when
she
fell
as
she
ever
would
be
in
the
flash
which
lit
everything
i
had
seen
where
her
pistol
was
pointed
why
disturb
her
then
nor
did
i
return
upstairs
i
had
small
interest
now
in
anything
but
my
own
escape
from
a
situation
more
or
less
compromising
do
you
blame
me
for
this
i
was
her
heir
and
i
was
where
i
had
no
legal
right
to
be
do
you
think
that
i
was
called
upon
to
publish
my
shame
and
tell
how
i
lingered
there
while
my
own
niece
shot
herself
before
my
eyes
that
shot
made
me
a
millionaire
this
certainly
was
excitement
enough
for
one
day
besides
i
did
not
leave
her
there
neglected
i
notified
you
later
after
i
had
got
my
breath
and
had
found
some
excuse
that
was
enough
ah
i
see
that
you
are
all
models
of
courage
and
magnanimity
you
would
have
laid
yourselves
open
to
every
reproach
rather
than
let
a
little
necessary
perjury
pass
your
lips
but
i
am
no
model
i
am
simply
an
old
man
who
has
been
too
hardly
dealt
with
for
seventy
long
years
to
possess
every
virtue
i
made
a
mistake
i
see
it
now
trusted
a
dog
when
i
should
but
if
rudge
had
not
seen
ghosts
well
what
now
we
had
one
and
all
with
an
involuntary
impulse
turned
our
backs
upon
him
what
are
you
doing
he
hotly
demanded
only
what
all
washington
will
do
and
afterwards
the
whole
world
gravely
returned
the
major
then
as
an
ejaculation
escaped
the
astonished
millionaire
he
impressively
added
a
perjury
which
allows
an
innocent
man
and
woman
to
remain
under
the
suspicion
of
murder
for
five
weeks
is
one
which
not
only
the
law
has
a
right
to
punish
but
which
all
society
will
condemn
henceforth
you
will
find
yourself
under
a
ban
mr
moore
my
story
ends
here
the
matter
never
came
before
the
grand
jury
suicide
had
been
proved
and
there
the
affair
rested
of
myself
it
is
enough
to
add
that
i
sometimes
call
in
durbin
to
help
me
in
a
big
case
time
amply
verified
this
prophecy
moore
is
living
in
great
style
in
the
moore
house
and
drives
horses
which
are
conspicuous
even
in
washington
but
no
one
accepts
his
invitations
and
he
is
as
much
of
a
recluse
in
his
present
mansion
as
he
ever
was
in
the
humble
cottage
in
which
his
days
of
penury
were
spent
xxvii
you
have
come
you
have
sought
me
these
are
some
words
from
a
letter
written
a
few
months
after
the
foregoing
by
one
edward
truscott
to
a
friend
in
new
york
edinburgh
may
dear
louisa
you
have
always
accused
me
of
seeing
more
and
hearing
more
than
any
other
person
of
your
acquaintance
perhaps
i
am
fortunate
in
that
respect
certainly
i
have
been
favored
today
with
an
adventure
of
some
interest
which
i
make
haste
to
relate
to
you
being
anxious
to
take
home
with
me
some
sketches
of
the
exquisite
ornamentation
in
the
rosslyn
chapel
about
which
i
wrote
you
so
enthusiastically
the
other
day
i
took
advantage
of
absence
this
morning
to
visit
the
place
again
and
this
time
alone
the
sky
was
clear
and
the
air
balmy
and
as
i
approached
the
spot
from
the
station
i
was
not
surprised
to
see
another
woman
straying
quietly
about
the
exterior
of
the
chapel
gazing
at
walls
which
interesting
as
they
are
are
but
a
rough
shell
hiding
the
incomparable
beauties
within
i
noticed
this
lady
i
could
not
help
it
she
was
one
to
attract
any
eye
seldom
have
i
seen
such
grace
such
beauty
and
both
infused
by
such
melancholy
her
sadness
added
wonderfully
to
her
charm
and
i
found
it
hard
enough
to
pass
her
with
the
single
glance
allowable
to
a
stranger
especially
as
she
gave
evidence
of
being
one
of
my
own
countrywomen
however
i
saw
no
alternative
and
once
within
the
charmed
edifice
forgot
everything
in
the
congenial
task
i
had
set
for
myself
for
some
reason
the
chapel
was
deserted
at
this
moment
by
all
but
me
as
the
special
i
wanted
was
in
a
crypt
down
a
short
flight
of
steps
at
the
right
of
the
altar
i
was
completely
hidden
from
view
to
any
one
entering
above
and
was
enjoying
both
my
seclusion
and
the
opportunity
it
gave
me
of
carrying
out
my
purpose
unwatched
when
i
heard
a
light
step
above
and
realized
that
the
exquisite
beauty
which
had
so
awakened
my
admiration
had
at
last
found
its
perfect
setting
such
a
face
amid
such
exquisite
surroundings
was
a
rare
sight
and
interested
as
i
always
am
in
artistic
effects
i
was
about
to
pocket
pencil
and
pad
and
make
my
way
up
to
where
she
moved
among
the
carved
pillars
when
i
heard
a
soft
sigh
above
and
caught
the
rustle
of
her
dress
as
she
sat
down
upon
a
bench
at
the
head
of
the
steps
near
which
i
stood
somehow
that
sigh
deterred
me
i
hesitated
to
break
in
upon
a
melancholy
so
invincible
that
even
the
sight
of
all
this
loveliness
could
not
charm
it
away
and
in
that
moment
of
hesitation
something
occurred
above
which
fixed
me
to
my
place
in
irrepressible
curiosity
another
step
had
entered
the
open
door
of
the
chapel
a
step
eager
and
with
a
purpose
in
it
eloquent
of
something
deeper
than
a
mere
tourist
interest
in
this
loveliest
of
interiors
the
cry
which
escaped
her
lips
the
tone
in
which
he
breathed
her
name
in
his
hurried
advance
convinced
me
that
this
was
a
meeting
of
two
lovers
after
a
long
and
that
i
should
mar
the
supreme
moment
of
their
lives
by
intruding
into
it
the
unwelcome
presence
of
a
stranger
so
i
lingered
where
i
was
and
thus
heard
what
passed
between
them
at
this
moment
of
all
moments
ire
their
lives
it
was
she
who
spoke
first
francis
you
have
come
you
have
sought
me
to
which
he
replied
in
choked
accents
which
yet
could
not
conceal
the
inexpressible
elation
of
his
heart
i
have
come
i
have
sought
you
why
did
you
fly
did
you
not
see
that
my
whole
soul
was
turning
to
you
as
it
never
turned
even
to
to
her
in
the
best
days
of
our
unshaken
love
and
that
i
could
never
rest
till
i
found
you
and
told
you
how
the
eyes
which
have
once
been
blind
enjoy
a
passion
of
seeing
unknown
to
others
a
passion
which
makes
the
object
seem
so
dear
so
dear
he
paused
perhaps
to
look
at
her
perhaps
to
recover
his
own
and
i
caught
the
echo
of
a
sigh
of
such
utter
content
and
triumph
from
her
lips
that
i
was
surprised
when
in
another
moment
she
exclaimed
in
a
tone
so
thrilling
that
i
am
sure
no
common
circumstances
had
separated
this
pair
we
a
right
to
happiness
while
she
oh
francis
i
can
not
she
loved
you
it
was
her
love
for
you
which
drove
her
came
with
a
sort
of
loving
authority
have
buried
our
erring
one
and
passionately
as
i
loved
her
she
is
no
more
mine
but
god
let
her
woeful
spirit
rest
you
who
suffered
supported
who
sacrificed
all
that
woman
holds
dear
to
save
what
in
the
nature
of
things
could
not
be
saved
have
more
than
right
to
happiness
if
it
is
in
my
power
to
give
it
to
you
i
who
have
failed
in
so
much
but
never
in
anything
more
than
in
not
seeing
where
true
worth
and
real
beauty
lay
cora
there
is
but
one
hand
which
can
lift
the
shadow
from
my
life
that
hand
i
am
holding
now
do
not
draw
it
away
it
is
my
anchor
my
hope
i
dare
not
confront
life
without
the
promise
it
holds
out
i
should
be
a
wreck
his
emotion
stopped
him
and
there
was
silence
then
i
heard
him
utter
solemnly
as
befitted
the
place
god
and
i
knew
that
she
had
turned
her
wonderful
eyes
upon
him
or
nestled
her
hand
in
his
clasp
as
only
a
loving
woman
may
the
next
moment
i
heard
them
draw
away
and
leave
the
place
do
you
wonder
that
i
long
to
know
who
they
are
and
what
their
story
is
and
whom
they
meant
by
erring
one
