book
the
first
the
days
before
was
invented
chapter
the
first
of
bladesover
house
and
my
mother
and
the
constitution
of
society
i
most
people
in
this
world
seem
to
live
in
character
they
have
a
beginning
a
middle
and
an
end
and
the
three
are
congruous
one
with
another
and
true
to
the
rules
of
their
type
you
can
speak
of
them
as
being
of
this
sort
of
people
or
that
they
are
as
theatrical
people
say
no
more
and
no
less
than
character
they
have
a
class
they
have
a
place
they
know
what
is
becoming
in
them
and
what
is
due
to
them
and
their
proper
size
of
tombstone
tells
at
last
how
properly
they
have
played
the
part
but
there
is
also
another
kind
of
life
that
is
not
so
much
living
as
a
miscellaneous
tasting
of
life
one
gets
hit
by
some
unusual
transverse
force
one
is
jerked
out
of
one
s
stratum
and
lives
crosswise
for
the
rest
of
the
time
and
as
it
were
in
a
succession
of
samples
that
has
been
my
lot
and
that
is
what
has
set
me
at
last
writing
something
in
the
nature
of
a
novel
i
have
got
an
unusual
series
of
impressions
that
i
want
very
urgently
to
tell
i
have
seen
life
at
very
different
levels
and
at
all
these
levels
i
have
seen
it
with
a
sort
of
intimacy
and
in
good
faith
i
have
been
a
native
in
many
social
countries
i
have
been
the
unwelcome
guest
of
a
working
baker
my
cousin
who
has
since
died
in
the
chatham
infirmary
i
have
eaten
illegal
snacks
the
unjustifiable
gifts
of
footmen
in
pantries
and
been
despised
for
my
want
of
style
and
subsequently
married
and
divorced
by
the
daughter
of
a
gasworks
clerk
and
to
go
to
my
other
extreme
i
was
once
oh
glittering
days
an
item
in
the
of
a
countess
she
was
i
admit
a
countess
with
a
financial
aspect
but
still
you
know
a
countess
i
ve
seen
these
people
at
various
angles
at
the
i
ve
met
not
simply
the
titled
but
the
great
on
one
occasion
it
is
my
brightest
memory
i
upset
my
champagne
over
the
trousers
of
the
greatest
statesman
in
the
empire
heaven
forbid
i
should
be
so
invidious
as
to
name
him
in
the
warmth
of
our
mutual
admiration
and
once
though
it
is
the
most
incidental
thing
in
my
life
i
murdered
a
man
yes
i
ve
seen
a
curious
variety
of
people
and
ways
of
living
altogether
odd
people
they
all
are
great
and
small
very
much
alike
at
bottom
and
curiously
different
on
their
surfaces
i
wish
i
had
ranged
just
a
little
further
both
up
and
down
seeing
i
have
ranged
so
far
royalty
must
be
worth
knowing
and
very
great
fun
but
my
contacts
with
princes
have
been
limited
to
quite
public
occasions
nor
at
the
other
end
of
the
scale
have
i
had
what
i
should
call
an
inside
acquaintance
with
that
dusty
but
attractive
class
of
people
who
go
about
on
the
drunk
but
enfamille
so
redeeming
the
minor
lapse
in
the
summertime
with
a
perambulator
lavender
to
sell
children
a
smell
and
ambiguous
bundles
that
fire
the
imagination
navvies
sailormen
and
stokers
all
such
as
sit
in
are
beyond
me
also
and
i
suppose
must
remain
so
now
for
ever
my
intercourse
with
the
ducal
rank
too
has
been
negligible
i
once
went
shooting
with
a
duke
and
in
an
outburst
of
what
was
no
doubt
snobbishness
did
my
best
to
get
him
in
the
legs
but
that
failed
i
m
sorry
i
haven
t
done
the
whole
lot
though
you
will
ask
by
what
merit
i
achieved
this
remarkable
social
range
this
extensive
of
the
british
social
organism
it
was
the
accident
of
birth
it
always
is
in
england
indeed
if
i
may
make
the
remark
so
cosmic
everything
is
but
that
is
by
the
way
i
was
my
uncle
s
nephew
and
my
uncle
was
no
less
a
person
than
edward
ponderevo
whose
transit
of
the
financial
heavens
happened
it
is
now
ten
years
ago
do
you
remember
the
days
of
ponderevo
the
great
days
i
mean
of
ponderevo
perhaps
you
had
a
trifle
in
some
enterprise
then
you
know
him
only
too
well
astraddle
on
he
flashed
athwart
the
empty
heavens
like
a
comet
rather
like
a
stupendous
rocket
and
overawed
investors
spoke
of
his
star
at
his
zenith
he
burst
into
a
cloud
of
the
most
magnificent
promotions
what
a
time
that
was
the
napoleon
of
domestic
conveniences
i
was
his
nephew
his
peculiar
and
intimate
nephew
i
was
hanging
on
to
his
all
the
way
through
i
made
pills
with
him
in
the
chemist
s
shop
at
wimblehurst
before
he
began
i
was
you
might
say
the
stick
of
his
rocket
and
after
our
tremendous
soar
after
he
had
played
with
millions
a
golden
rain
in
the
sky
after
my
bird
view
of
the
modern
world
i
fell
again
a
little
scarred
and
blistered
perhaps
two
and
twenty
years
older
with
my
youth
gone
my
manhood
eaten
in
upon
but
greatly
edified
into
this
yard
into
these
white
heats
and
hammerings
amidst
the
fine
realites
of
steel
to
think
it
all
over
in
my
leisure
and
jot
down
the
notes
and
inconsecutive
observations
that
make
this
book
it
was
more
you
know
than
a
figurative
soar
the
zenith
of
that
career
was
surely
our
flight
across
the
channel
in
the
lord
roberts
b
i
warn
you
this
book
is
going
to
be
something
of
an
agglomeration
i
want
to
trace
my
social
trajectory
and
my
uncle
s
as
the
main
line
of
my
story
but
as
this
is
my
first
novel
and
almost
certainly
my
last
i
want
to
get
in
too
all
sorts
of
things
that
struck
me
things
that
amused
me
and
impressions
i
got
even
although
they
don
t
minister
directly
to
my
narrative
at
all
i
want
to
set
out
my
own
queer
love
experiences
too
such
as
they
are
for
they
troubled
and
distressed
and
swayed
me
hugely
and
they
still
seem
to
me
to
contain
all
sorts
of
irrational
and
debatable
elements
that
i
shall
be
the
for
getting
on
paper
and
possibly
i
may
even
flow
into
descriptions
of
people
who
are
really
no
more
than
people
seen
in
transit
just
because
it
amuses
me
to
recall
what
they
said
and
did
to
us
and
more
particularly
how
they
behaved
in
the
brief
but
splendid
glare
of
and
its
still
more
glaring
offspring
it
lit
some
of
them
up
i
can
assure
you
indeed
i
want
to
get
in
all
sorts
of
things
my
ideas
of
a
novel
all
through
are
comprehensive
rather
than
austere
still
figures
on
the
hoardings
it
stands
in
rows
in
every
chemist
s
storeroom
it
still
assuages
the
coughs
of
age
and
brightens
the
elderly
eye
and
loosens
the
elderly
tongue
but
its
social
glory
its
financial
illumination
have
faded
from
the
world
for
ever
and
i
sole
scorched
survivor
from
the
blaze
sit
writing
of
it
here
in
an
air
that
is
never
still
for
the
clang
and
thunder
of
machines
on
a
table
littered
with
working
drawings
and
amid
fragments
of
models
and
notes
about
velocities
and
air
and
water
pressures
and
trajectories
of
an
altogether
different
sort
from
that
of
ii
i
write
that
much
and
look
at
it
and
wonder
whether
after
all
this
is
any
fair
statement
of
what
i
am
attempting
in
this
book
i
ve
given
i
see
an
impression
that
i
want
to
make
simply
a
of
anecdotes
and
experiences
with
my
uncle
swimming
in
the
middle
as
the
largest
lump
of
victual
i
ll
own
that
here
with
the
pen
already
started
i
realise
what
a
fermenting
mass
of
things
learnt
and
emotions
experienced
and
theories
formed
i
ve
got
to
deal
with
and
how
in
a
sense
hopeless
my
book
must
be
from
the
very
outset
i
suppose
what
i
m
really
trying
to
render
is
nothing
more
nor
less
than
life
as
one
man
has
found
it
i
want
to
tell
myself
and
my
impressions
of
the
thing
as
a
whole
to
say
things
i
have
come
to
feel
intensely
of
the
laws
traditions
usages
and
ideas
we
call
society
and
how
we
poor
individuals
get
driven
and
lured
and
stranded
among
these
windy
perplexing
shoals
and
channels
i
ve
got
i
suppose
to
a
time
of
life
when
things
begin
to
take
on
shapes
that
have
an
air
of
reality
and
become
no
longer
material
for
dreaming
but
interesting
in
themselves
i
ve
reached
the
criticising
age
and
here
i
am
writing
mine
my
one
novel
without
having
any
of
the
discipline
to
refrain
and
omit
that
i
suppose
the
regular
acquires
i
ve
read
an
average
share
of
novels
and
made
some
starts
before
this
beginning
and
i
ve
found
the
restraints
and
rules
of
the
art
as
i
made
them
out
impossible
for
me
i
like
to
write
i
am
keenly
interested
in
writing
but
it
is
not
my
technique
i
m
an
engineer
with
a
patent
or
two
and
a
set
of
ideas
most
of
whatever
artist
there
is
in
me
has
been
given
to
turbine
machines
and
boat
building
and
the
problem
of
flying
and
do
what
i
will
i
fail
to
see
how
i
can
be
other
than
a
lax
undisciplined
i
must
sprawl
and
flounder
comment
and
theorise
if
i
am
to
get
the
thing
out
i
have
in
mind
and
it
isn
t
a
constructed
tale
i
have
to
tell
but
unmanageable
realities
my
and
if
only
i
can
keep
up
the
spirit
of
all
through
as
strongly
as
i
have
now
you
shall
have
it
all
falls
into
no
sort
of
neat
scheme
of
telling
it
involves
three
separate
feminine
persons
it
s
all
mixed
up
with
the
other
things
but
i
ve
said
enough
i
hope
to
excuse
myself
for
the
method
or
want
of
method
in
what
follows
and
i
think
i
had
better
tell
without
further
delay
of
my
boyhood
and
my
early
impressions
in
the
shadow
of
bladesover
house
iii
there
came
a
time
when
i
realised
that
bladesover
house
was
not
all
it
seemed
but
when
i
was
a
little
boy
i
took
the
place
with
the
entirest
faith
as
a
complete
authentic
microcosm
i
believed
that
the
bladesover
system
was
a
little
and
not
so
very
little
either
of
the
whole
world
let
me
try
and
give
you
the
effect
of
it
bladesover
lies
up
on
the
kentish
downs
eight
miles
perhaps
from
ashborough
and
its
old
pavilion
a
little
wooden
parody
of
the
temple
of
vesta
at
tibur
upon
the
hill
crest
behind
the
house
commands
in
theory
at
least
a
view
of
either
sea
of
the
channel
southward
and
the
thames
to
the
northeast
the
park
is
the
second
largest
in
kent
finely
wooded
with
beeches
many
elms
and
some
sweet
chestnuts
abounding
in
little
valleys
and
hollows
of
bracken
with
springs
and
a
stream
and
three
fine
ponds
and
multitudes
of
fallow
deer
the
house
was
built
in
the
eighteenth
century
it
is
of
pale
red
brick
in
the
style
of
a
french
chateau
and
save
for
one
pass
among
the
crests
which
opens
to
blue
distances
to
minute
remote
and
copses
and
wheat
fields
and
the
occasional
gleam
of
water
its
hundred
and
seventeen
windows
look
on
nothing
but
its
own
wide
and
handsome
territories
a
screen
of
great
beeches
masks
the
church
and
village
which
cluster
picturesquely
about
the
high
road
along
the
skirts
of
the
great
park
northward
at
the
remotest
corner
of
that
enclosure
is
a
second
dependent
village
ropedean
less
fortunate
in
its
greater
distance
and
also
on
account
of
a
rector
this
divine
was
indeed
rich
but
he
was
vindictively
economical
because
of
some
shrinkage
of
his
tithes
and
by
reason
of
his
use
of
the
word
eucharist
for
the
lord
s
supper
he
had
become
altogether
estranged
from
the
great
ladies
of
bladesover
so
that
ropedean
was
in
the
shadows
through
all
that
youthful
time
now
the
unavoidable
suggestion
of
that
wide
park
and
that
fair
large
house
dominating
church
village
and
the
country
side
was
that
they
represented
the
thing
that
mattered
supremely
in
the
world
and
that
all
other
things
had
significance
only
in
relation
to
them
they
represented
the
gentry
the
quality
by
and
through
and
for
whom
the
rest
of
the
world
the
farming
folk
and
the
labouring
folk
the
of
ashborough
and
the
upper
servants
and
the
lower
servants
and
the
servants
of
the
estate
breathed
and
lived
and
were
permitted
and
the
quality
did
it
so
quietly
and
thoroughly
the
great
house
mingled
so
solidly
and
effectually
earth
and
sky
the
contrast
of
its
spacious
hall
and
saloon
and
galleries
its
airy
housekeeper
s
room
and
warren
of
offices
with
the
meagre
dignities
of
the
vicar
and
the
pinched
and
stuffy
rooms
of
even
the
people
and
the
grocer
so
enforced
these
suggestions
that
it
was
only
when
i
was
a
boy
of
thirteen
or
fourteen
and
some
queer
inherited
strain
of
scepticism
had
set
me
doubting
whether
bartlett
the
vicar
did
really
know
with
certainty
all
about
god
that
as
a
further
and
deeper
step
in
doubting
i
began
to
question
the
final
rightness
of
the
gentlefolks
their
primary
necessity
in
the
scheme
of
things
but
once
that
scepticism
had
awakened
it
took
me
fast
and
far
by
fourteen
i
had
achieved
terrible
blasphemies
and
sacrilege
i
had
resolved
to
marry
a
viscount
s
daughter
and
i
had
blacked
the
left
eye
i
think
it
was
the
left
of
her
in
open
and
declared
rebellion
but
of
that
in
its
place
the
great
house
the
church
the
village
and
the
labourers
and
the
servants
in
their
stations
and
degrees
seemed
to
me
i
say
to
be
a
closed
and
complete
social
system
about
us
were
other
villages
and
great
estates
and
from
house
to
house
interlacing
correlated
the
gentry
the
fine
olympians
came
and
went
the
country
towns
seemed
mere
collections
of
ships
marketing
places
for
the
tenantry
centres
for
such
education
as
they
needed
as
entirely
dependent
on
the
gentry
as
the
village
and
scarcely
less
directly
so
i
thought
this
was
the
order
of
the
whole
world
i
thought
london
was
only
a
greater
country
town
where
the
kept
and
did
their
greater
shopping
under
the
magnificent
shadow
of
the
greatest
of
all
fine
gentlewomen
the
queen
it
seemed
to
be
in
the
divine
order
that
all
this
fine
appearance
was
already
sapped
that
there
were
forces
at
work
that
might
presently
carry
all
this
elaborate
social
system
in
which
my
mother
instructed
me
so
carefully
that
i
might
understand
my
place
to
limbo
had
scarcely
dawned
upon
me
even
by
the
time
that
was
fairly
launched
upon
the
world
there
are
many
people
in
england
upon
whom
it
has
not
yet
dawned
there
are
times
when
i
doubt
whether
any
but
a
very
inconsiderable
minority
of
english
people
realise
how
extensively
this
ostensible
order
has
even
now
passed
away
the
great
houses
stand
in
the
parks
still
the
cottages
cluster
respectfully
on
their
borders
touching
their
eaves
with
their
creepers
the
english
countryside
you
can
range
through
kent
from
bladesover
northward
and
see
persists
obstinately
in
looking
what
it
was
it
is
like
an
early
day
in
a
fine
october
the
hand
of
change
rests
on
it
all
unfelt
unseen
resting
for
awhile
as
it
were
half
reluctantly
before
it
grips
and
ends
the
thing
for
ever
one
frost
and
the
whole
face
of
things
will
be
bare
links
snap
patience
end
our
fine
foliage
of
pretences
lie
glowing
in
the
mire
for
that
we
have
still
to
wait
a
little
while
the
new
order
may
have
gone
far
towards
shaping
itself
but
just
as
in
that
sort
of
lantern
show
that
used
to
be
known
in
the
village
as
the
dissolving
views
the
scene
that
is
going
remains
upon
the

of

of

have
certainly
never
really
entered
into
the
english
mind

what
is
coming
into
it
all
this
book
i
hope
will
bear
a
little
on
that
our
people
never
formulates
it
keeps
words
for
jests
and
ironies

the
old

old

bladesover
house
is
now

reuben
lichtenstein
and
has
been
since
old
lady
drew
died
it
was
my
odd
experience
to
visit
there
in
the
house
of
which
my
mother
had
been
housekeeper
when
my
uncle
was
at
the
climax
of
it
was
curious
to
notice
then
the
little
differences
that
had
come
to
things
with
this
substitution
to
borrow
an
image
from
my
mineralogical
days
these
jews
were
not
so
much
a
new
british
gentry
as
pseudomorphous
after
the
gentry
they
are
a
very
clever
people
the
jews
but
not
clever
enough
to
suppress
their
cleverness
i
wished
i
could
have
gone
downstairs
to
savour
the
tone
of
the
pantry
it
would
have
been
very
different
i
know
hawksnest
over
beyond
i
noted
had
its
pseudomorph
too
a
newspaper
proprietor
of
the
type
that
hustles
along
with
stolen
ideas
from
one
loud
enterprise
to
another
had
bought
the
place
outright
redgrave
was
in
the
hands
of
brewers
but
the
people
in
the
villages
so
far
as
i
could
detect
saw
no
difference
in
their
world
two
little
girls
bobbed
and
an
old
labourer
touched
his
hat
convulsively
as
i
walked
through
the
village
he
still
thought
he
knew
his
place
and
mine
i
did
not
know
him
but
i
would
have
liked
dearly
to
have
asked
him
if
he
remembered
my
mother
if
either
my
uncle
or
old
lichtenstein
had
been
man
enough
to
stand
being
given
away
like
that
in
that
english
countryside
of
my
boyhood
every
human
being
had
a
it
belonged
to
you
from
your
birth
like
the
colour
of
your
eyes
it
was
inextricably
your
destiny
above
you
were
your
betters
below
you
were
your
inferiors
and
there
were
even
an
unstable
questionable
few
cases
so
disputable
that
you
might
for
the
rough
purposes
of
every
day
at
least
regard
them
as
your
equals
head
and
centre
of
our
system
was
lady
drew
her
leddyship
shrivelled
garrulous
with
a
wonderful
memory
for
genealogies
and
very
very
old
and
beside
her
and
nearly
as
old
miss
somerville
her
cousin
and
companion
these
two
old
souls
lived
like
kernels
in
the
great
shell
of
bladesover
house
the
shell
that
had
once
been
gaily
full
of
fops
of
fine
ladies
in
powder
and
patches
and
courtly
gentlemen
with
swords
and
when
there
was
no
company
they
spent
whole
days
in
the
corner
parlour
just
over
the
housekeeper
s
room
between
reading
and
slumber
and
caressing
their
two
pet
dogs
when
i
was
a
boy
i
used
always
to
think
of
these
two
poor
old
creatures
as
superior
beings
living
like
god
somewhere
through
the
ceiling
occasionally
they
bumped
about
a
bit
and
one
even
heard
them
overhead
which
gave
them
a
greater
effect
of
reality
without
mitigating
their
vertical
predominance
sometimes
too
i
saw
them
of
course
if
i
came
upon
them
in
the
park
or
in
the
shrubbery
where
i
was
a
trespasser
i
hid
or
fled
in
pious
horror
but
i
was
upon
due
occasion
taken
into
the
presence
by
request
i
remember
her
leddyship
then
as
a
thing
of
black
silks
and
a
golden
chain
a
quavering
injunction
to
me
to
be
a
good
boy
a
very
shrunken
face
and
neck
and
a
ropy
hand
that
trembled
a
halfcrown
into
mine
miss
somerville
hovered
behind
a
paler
thing
of
broken
lavender
and
white
and
black
with
screwed
up
eyes
her
hair
was
yellow
and
her
colour
bright
and
when
we
sat
in
the
housekeeper
s
room
of
a
winter
s
night
warming
our
toes
and
sipping
elder
wine
her
maid
would
tell
us
the
simple
secrets
of
that
belated
flush
after
my
fight
with
young
garvell
i
was
of
course
banished
and
i
never
saw
those
poor
old
painted
goddesses
again
then
there
came
and
went
on
these
floors
over
our
respectful
heads
the
company
people
i
rarely
saw
but
whose
tricks
and
manners
were
imitated
and
discussed
by
their
maids
and
valets
in
the
housekeeper
s
room
and
the
steward
s
room
so
that
i
had
them
through
a
medium
at
second
hand
i
gathered
that
none
of
the
company
were
really
lady
drew
s
equals
they
were
greater
and
lesser
after
the
manner
of
all
things
in
our
world
once
i
remember
there
was
a
prince
with
a
real
live
gentleman
in
attendance
and
that
was
a
little
above
our
customary
levels
and
excited
us
all
and
perhaps
raised
our
expectations
unduly
afterwards
rabbits
the
butler
came
into
my
mother
s
room
downstairs
red
with
indignation
and
with
tears
in
his
eyes
look
at
that
gasped
rabbits
my
mother
was
speechless
with
horror
that
was
a
sovereign
a
mere
sovereign
such
as
you
might
get
from
any
commoner
after
company
i
remember
came
anxious
days
for
the
poor
old
women
upstairs
were
left
tired
and
cross
and
vindictive
and
in
a
state
of
physical
and
emotional
indigestion
after
their
social
efforts
on
the
lowest
fringe
of
these
real
olympians
hung
the
vicarage
people
and
next
to
them
came
those
ambiguous
beings
who
are
neither
quality
nor
subjects
the
vicarage
people
certainly
hold
a
place
by
themselves
in
the
typical
english
scheme
nothing
is
more
remarkable
than
the
progress
the
church
has
made
socially
in
the
last
two
hundred
years
in
the
early
eighteenth
century
the
vicar
was
rather
under
than
over
the
and
was
deemed
a
fitting
match
for
the
housekeeper
or
any
not
too
morally
discredited
discard
the
eighteenth
century
literature
is
full
of
his
complaints
that
he
might
not
remain
at
table
to
share
the
pie
he
rose
above
these
indignities
because
of
the
abundance
of
younger
sons
when
i
meet
the
large
assumptions
of
the
contemporary
cleric
i
am
apt
to
think
of
these
things
it
is
curious
to
note
that
that
creature
the
church
of
england
village
schoolmaster
holds
much
the
same
position
as
the
seventeenth
century
parson
the
doctor
in
bladesover
ranked
below
the
vicar
but
above
the
vet
artists
and
summer
visitors
squeezed
in
above
or
below
this
point
according
to
their
appearance
and
expenditure
and
then
in
a
carefully
arranged
scale
came
the
tenantry
the
butler
and
housekeeper
the
village
shopkeeper
the
head
keeper
the
cook
the
publican
the
second
keeper
the
blacksmith
whose
status
was
complicated
by
his
daughter
keeping
the
and
a
fine
hash
she
used
to
make
of
telegrams
too
the
village
shopkeeper
s
eldest
son
the
first
footman
younger
sons
of
the
village
shopkeeper
his
first
assistant
and
so
forth
all
these
conceptions
and
applications
of
a
universal
precedence
and
much
else
i
drank
in
at
bladesover
as
i
listened
to
the
talk
of
valets
ladies
rabbits
the
butler
and
my
mother
in
the
housekeeper
s
room
where
the
upper
servants
assembled
or
of
footmen
and
rabbits
and
estate
men
of
all
sorts
among
the
green
baize
and
windsor
chairs
of
the
pantry
where
rabbits
being
above
the
law
sold
beer
without
a
license
or
any
compunction
or
of
housemaids
and
maids
in
the
bleak
or
of
the
cook
and
her
kitchen
maids
and
casual
friends
among
the
bright
copper
and
hot
glow
of
the
kitchens
of
course
their
own
ranks
and
places
came
by
implication
to
these
people
and
it
was
with
the
ranks
and
places
of
the
olympians
that
the
talk
mainly
concerned
itself
there
was
an
old
peerage
and
a
crockford
together
with
the
books
of
recipes
the
whitaker
s
almanack
the
old
moore
s
almanack
and
the
eighteenth
century
dictionary
on
the
little
dresser
that
broke
the
cupboards
on
one
side
of
my
mother
s
room
there
was
another
peerage
with
the
covers
off
in
the
pantry
there
was
a
new
peerage
in
the
and
i
seem
to
remember
another
in
the
anomalous
apartment
that
held
the
upper
servants
bagatelle
board
and
in
which
after
the
hall
dinner
they
partook
of
the
luxury
of
sweets
and
if
you
had
asked
any
of
those
upper
servants
how
such
and
such
a
prince
of
battenberg
was
related
to
let
us
say
cunninghame
graham
or
the
duke
of
argyle
you
would
have
been
told
upon
the
nail
as
a
boy
i
heard
a
great
deal
of
that
sort
of
thing
and
if
to
this
day
i
am
still
a
little
vague
about
courtesy
titles
and
the
exact
application
of
honorifics
it
is
i
can
assure
you
because
i
hardened
my
heart
and
not
from
any
lack
of
adequate
opportunity
of
mastering
these
succulent
particulars
dominating
all
these
memories
is
the
figure
of
my
mother
my
mother
who
did
not
love
me
because
i
grew
liker
my
father
every
day
and
who
knew
with
inflexible
decision
her
place
and
the
place
of
every
one
in
the
world
except
the
place
that
concealed
my
father
and
in
some
details
mine
subtle
points
were
put
to
her
i
can
see
and
hear
her
saying
now
no
miss
fison
peers
of
england
go
in
before
peers
of
the
united
kingdom
and
he
is
merely
a
peer
of
the
united
she
had
much
exercise
in
placing
people
s
servants
about
her
where
the
etiquette
was
very
strict
i
wonder
sometimes
if
the
etiquette
of
housekeepers
rooms
is
as
strict
and
what
my
mother
would
have
made
of
a
chauffeur
on
the
whole
i
am
glad
that
i
saw
so
much
as
i
did
of
bladesover
if
for
no
other
reason
than
because
seeing
it
when
i
did
quite
naively
believing
in
it
thoroughly
and
then
coming
to
analyse
it
has
enabled
me
to
understand
much
that
would
be
absolutely
incomprehensible
in
the
structure
of
english
society
bladesover
is
i
am
convinced
the
clue
to
almost
all
that
is
distinctively
british
and
perplexing
to
the
foreign
inquirer
in
england
and
the
peoples
grasp
firmly
that
england
was
all
bladesover
two
hundred
years
ago
that
it
has
had
reform
acts
indeed
and
such
like
changes
of
formula
but
no
essential
revolution
since
then
that
all
that
is
modern
and
different
has
come
in
as
a
thing
intruded
or
as
a
gloss
upon
this
predominant
formula
either
impertinently
or
apologetically
and
you
will
perceive
at
once
the
reasonableness
the
necessity
of
that
snobbishness
which
is
the
distinctive
quality
of
english
thought
everybody
who
is
not
actually
in
the
shadow
of
a
bladesover
is
as
it
were
perpetually
seeking
after
lost
orientations
we
have
never
broken
with
our
tradition
never
even
symbolically
hewed
it
to
pieces
as
the
french
did
in
quivering
fact
in
the
terror
but
all
the
organizing
ideas
have
slackened
the
old
habitual
bonds
have
relaxed
or
altogether
come
undone
and
america
too
is
as
it
were
a
detached
outlying
part
of
that
estate
which
has
expanded
in
queer
ways
george
washington
esquire
was
of
the
gentlefolk
and
he
came
near
being
a
king
it
was
plutarch
you
know
and
nothing
intrinsically
american
that
prevented
george
washington
being
a
king
iv
i
hated
teatime
in
the
housekeeper
s
room
more
than
anything
else
at
bladesover
and
more
particularly
i
hated
it
when
mackridge
and
booch
and
were
staying
in
the
house
they
were
all
three
of
them
servants
old
friends
of
lady
drew
s
had
rewarded
them
posthumously
for
a
prolonged
devotion
to
their
minor
comforts
and
booch
was
also
trustee
for
a
favourite
skye
terrier
every
year
lady
drew
gave
them
an
invitation
a
reward
and
encouragement
of
virtue
with
especial
reference
to
my
mother
and
miss
fison
the
maid
they
sat
about
in
black
and
shiny
and
flouncey
clothing
adorned
with
gimp
and
beads
eating
great
quantities
of
cake
drinking
much
tea
in
a
stately
manner
and
reverberating
remarks
i
remember
these
women
as
immense
no
doubt
they
were
of
negotiable
size
but
i
was
only
a
very
little
chap
and
they
have
assumed
nightmare
proportions
in
my
mind
they
loomed
they
bulged
they
impended
mackridge
was
large
and
dark
there
was
a
marvel
about
her
head
inasmuch
as
she
was
bald
she
wore
a
dignified
cap
and
in
front
of
that
upon
her
brow
hair
was
painted
i
have
never
seen
the
like
since
she
had
been
maid
to
the
widow
of
sir
roderick
blenderhasset
impey
some
sort
of
governor
or
portent
in
the
east
indies
and
from
her
remains
in
mackridge
i
judge
lady
impey
was
a
very
stupendous
and
crushing
creature
indeed
lady
impey
had
been
of
the
juno
type
haughty
unapproachable
given
to
irony
and
a
caustic
wit
mackridge
had
no
wit
but
she
had
acquired
the
caustic
voice
and
gestures
along
with
the
old
satins
and
trimmings
of
the
great
lady
when
she
told
you
it
was
a
fine
morning
she
seemed
also
to
be
telling
you
you
were
a
fool
and
a
low
fool
to
boot
when
she
was
spoken
to
she
had
a
way
of
acknowledging
your
poor
tinkle
of
utterance
with
a
voluminous
scornful
haw
that
made
you
want
to
burn
her
alive
she
also
had
a
way
of
saying
indade
with
a
droop
of
the
eyelids
booch
was
a
smaller
woman
brown
haired
with
queer
little
curls
on
either
side
of
her
face
large
blue
eyes
and
a
small
set
of
stereotyped
remarks
that
constituted
her
entire
mental
range
has
left
oddly
enough
no
memory
at
all
except
her
name
and
the
effect
of
a
silk
dress
all
set
with
gold
and
blue
buttons
i
fancy
she
was
a
large
blonde
then
there
was
miss
fison
the
maid
who
served
both
lady
drew
and
miss
somerville
and
at
the
end
of
the
table
opposite
my
mother
sat
rabbits
the
butler
rabbits
for
a
butler
was
an
unassuming
man
and
at
tea
he
was
not
as
you
know
butlers
but
in
a
morning
coat
and
a
black
tie
with
blue
spots
still
he
was
large
with
side
whiskers
even
if
his
mouth
was
weak
and
little
i
sat
among
these
people
on
a
high
hard
early
gregorian
chair
trying
to
exist
like
a
feeble
seedling
amidst
great
rocks
and
my
mother
sat
with
an
eye
upon
me
resolute
to
suppress
the
slightest
manifestation
of
vitality
it
was
hard
on
me
but
perhaps
it
was
also
hard
upon
these
rather
ageing
pretending
people
that
my
youthful
restlessness
and
rebellious
unbelieving
eyes
should
be
thrust
in
among
their
dignities
tea
lasted
for
nearly
of
an
hour
and
i
sat
it
out
perforce
and
day
after
day
the
talk
was
exactly
the
same
sugar
mackridge
my
mother
used
to
ask
sugar
the
word
sugar
would
stir
the
mind
of
mackridge
they
say
she
would
begin
issuing
her
proclamation
at
least
half
her
sentences
began
they
say
sugar
is
nowadays
many
of
the
best
people
do
not
take
it
at
not
with
their
tea
ma
am
said
rabbits
intelligently
not
with
anything
said
mackridge
with
an
air
of
crushing
repartee
and
drank
what
won
t
they
say
next
said
miss
fison
they
do
say
such
things
said
booch
they
say
said
mackridge
inflexibly
the
doctors
are
not
it
my
mother
no
ma
am
mackridge
no
ma
then
to
the
table
at
large
poor
sir
roderick
before
he
died
consumed
great
of
sugar
i
have
sometimes
fancied
it
may
have
hastened
his
this
ended
the
first
skirmish
a
certain
gloom
of
manner
and
a
pause
was
considered
due
to
the
sacred
memory
of
sir
roderick
george
said
my
mother
don
t
kick
the
chair
then
perhaps
booch
would
produce
a
favourite
piece
from
her
repertoire
the
evenings
are
drawing
out
nicely
she
would
say
or
if
the
season
was
decadent
how
the
evenings
draw
in
it
was
an
invaluable
remark
to
her
i
do
not
know
how
she
would
have
got
along
without
it
my
mother
who
sat
with
her
back
to
the
window
would
always
consider
it
due
to
booch
to
turn
about
and
regard
the
evening
in
the
act
of
elongation
or
contraction
whichever
phase
it
might
be
a
brisk
discussion
of
how
long
we
were
to
the
longest
or
shortest
day
would
ensue
and
die
away
at
last
exhausted
mackridge
perhaps
would
reopen
she
had
many
intelligent
habits
among
others
she
read
the
paper
the
morning
post
the
other
ladies
would
at
times
tackle
that
sheet
but
only
to
read
the
births
marriages
and
deaths
on
the
front
page
it
was
of
course
the
old
morning
post
that
cost
threepence
not
the
brisk
coruscating
young
thing
of
they
say
she
would
open
that
lord

they
isn

he
said
my
mother
the
earl
of

s
cousin
she
knew
he
was
it
was
an
entirely
irrelevant
and
unnecessary
remark
but
still
something
to
say
the

said
mackridge
they
say
he
was

popular
in

south
wales
they
looked
up
to
him
greatlay
i
knew
him
ma
am
as
a
young
man
a
very
nice
pleasant
young
interlude
of
respect
is
predecessor
said
rabbits
who
had
acquired
from
some
clerical
model
a
precise
emphatic
articulation
without
acquiring
at
the
same
time
the
aspirates
that
would
have
graced
it
got
into
trouble
at
haw
said
mackridge
scornfully
so
am
e
came
to
templemorton
after
e
came
back
and
i
remember
them
talking
im
over
after
e
d
gone
haw
said
mackridge
interrogatively
is
fuss
was
quotin
poetry
ma
am
e
said
what
was
it
e
said
they
lef
their
country
for
their
country
s
good
which
in
some
way
was
took
to
remind
them
of
their
being
originally
convic
s
though
now
reformed
every
one
i
eard
speak
agreed
it
was
takless
of
sir
roderick
used
to
say
said
mackridge
that
the
first
thing
here
mackridge
paused
and
looked
dreadfully
at
me
and
the
second
thing
here
she
fixed
me
again
and
the
third
thing
now
i
was
released
needed
in
a
colonial
governor
is
she
became
aware
of
my
doubts
again
and
added
predominantly
it
has
always
struck
me
that
that
was
a
singularly
true
i
resolved
that
if
ever
i
found
this
polypus
of
tact
growing
up
in
my
soul
i
would
tear
it
out
by
the
roots
throw
it
forth
and
stamp
on
it
they
re
queer
people
colonials
said
rabbits
very
queer
when
i
was
at
templemorton
i
see
something
of
em
queer
fellows
some
of
em
very
respectful
of
course
free
with
their
money
in
a
spasammy
sort
of
way
but
some
of
em
i
must
confess
make
me
nervous
they
have
an
eye
on
you
they
watch
you
as
you
wait
they
let
themselves
appear
to
be
lookin
at
you
my
mother
said
nothing
in
that
discussion
the
word
colonies
always
upset
her
she
was
afraid
i
think
that
if
she
turned
her
mind
in
that
direction
my
errant
father
might
suddenly
and
shockingly
be
discovered
no
doubt
conspicuously
bigamic
and
altogether
offensive
and
revolutionary
she
did
not
want
to
rediscover
my
father
at
all
it
is
curious
that
when
i
was
a
little
listening
boy
i
had
such
an
idea
of
our
colonies
that
i
jeered
in
my
heart
at
mackridge
s
colonial
ascendancy
these
brave
emancipated
sunburnt
english
of
the
open
i
thought
suffer
these
aristocratic
invaders
as
a
quaint
anachronism
but
as
for
being
gratified
i
don
t
jeer
now
i
m
not
so
sure
v
it
is
a
little
difficult
to
explain
why
i
did
not
come
to
do
what
was
the
natural
thing
for
any
one
in
my
circumstances
to
do
and
take
my
world
for
granted
a
certain
innate
scepticism
i
think
explains
it
and
a
certain
inaptitude
for
sympathetic
assimilation
my
father
i
believe
was
a
sceptic
my
mother
was
certainly
a
hard
woman
i
was
an
only
child
and
to
this
day
i
do
not
know
whether
my
father
is
living
or
dead
he
fled
my
mother
s
virtues
before
my
distincter
memories
began
he
left
no
traces
in
his
flight
and
she
in
her
indignation
destroyed
every
vestige
that
she
could
of
him
never
a
photograph
nor
a
scrap
of
his
handwriting
have
i
seen
and
it
was
i
know
only
the
accepted
code
of
virtue
and
discretion
that
prevented
her
destroying
her
marriage
certificate
and
me
and
so
making
a
clean
sweep
of
her
matrimonial
humiliation
i
suppose
i
must
inherit
something
of
the
moral
stupidity
that
would
enable
her
to
make
a
holocaust
of
every
little
personal
thing
she
had
of
him
there
must
have
been
presents
made
by
him
as
a
lover
for
example
books
with
kindly
inscriptions
letters
perhaps
a
flattened
flower
a
ring
or
gage
she
kept
her
of
course
but
all
the
others
she
destroyed
she
never
told
me
his
christian
name
or
indeed
spoke
a
word
to
me
of
him
though
at
times
i
came
near
daring
to
ask
her
add
what
i
have
of
him
it
isn
t
much
i
got
from
his
brother
my
hero
my
uncle
ponderevo
she
wore
her
ring
her
marriage
certificate
she
kept
in
a
sealed
envelope
in
the
very
bottom
of
her
largest
trunk
and
me
she
sustained
at
a
private
school
among
the
kentish
hills
you
must
not
think
i
was
always
at
bladesover
even
in
my
holidays
if
at
the
time
these
came
round
lady
drew
was
vexed
by
recent
company
or
for
any
other
reason
wished
to
take
it
out
of
my
mother
then
she
used
to
ignore
the
customary
reminder
my
mother
gave
her
and
i
stayed
on
at
the
school
but
such
occasions
were
rare
and
i
suppose
that
between
ten
and
fourteen
i
averaged
fifty
days
a
year
at
bladesover
don
t
imagine
i
deny
that
was
a
fine
thing
for
me
bladesover
in
absorbing
the
whole
countryside
had
not
altogether
missed
greatness
the
bladesover
system
has
at
least
done
one
good
thing
for
england
it
has
abolished
the
peasant
habit
of
mind
if
many
of
us
still
live
and
breathe
pantry
and
housekeeper
s
room
we
are
quit
of
the
dream
of
living
by
economising
parasitically
on
hens
and
pigs
about
that
park
there
were
some
elements
of
a
liberal
education
there
was
a
great
space
of
greensward
not
given
over
to
manure
and
food
grubbing
there
was
mystery
there
was
matter
for
the
imagination
it
was
still
a
park
of
deer
i
saw
something
of
the
life
of
these
dappled
creatures
heard
the
belling
of
stags
came
upon
young
fawns
among
the
bracken
found
bones
skulls
and
antlers
in
lonely
places
there
were
corners
that
gave
a
gleam
of
meaning
to
the
word
forest
glimpses
of
unstudied
natural
splendour
there
was
a
slope
of
bluebells
in
the
broken
sunlight
under
the
newly
green
beeches
in
the
west
wood
that
is
now
precious
sapphire
in
my
memory
it
was
the
first
time
that
i
knowingly
met
beauty
and
in
the
house
there
were
books
the
rubbish
old
lady
drew
read
i
never
saw
stuff
of
the
maria
monk
type
i
have
since
gathered
had
a
fascination
for
her
but
back
in
the
past
there
had
been
a
drew
of
intellectual
enterprise
sir
cuthbert
the
son
of
sir
matthew
who
built
the
house
and
thrust
away
neglected
and
despised
in
an
old
room
upstairs
were
books
and
treasures
of
his
that
my
mother
let
me
rout
among
during
a
spell
of
wintry
wet
sitting
under
a
dormer
window
on
a
shelf
above
great
stores
of
tea
and
spices
i
became
familiar
with
much
of
hogarth
in
a
big
portfolio
with
raphael
there
was
a
great
book
of
engravings
from
the
stanzas
of
raphael
in
the
vatican
and
with
most
of
the
capitals
of
europe
as
they
had
looked
about
by
means
of
several
pig
books
of
views
there
was
also
a
broad
eighteenth
century
atlas
with
huge
wandering
maps
that
instructed
me
mightily
it
had
splendid
adornments
about
each
map
title
holland
showed
a
fisherman
and
his
boat
russia
a
cossack
japan
remarkable
people
attired
in
pagodas
i
say
it
deliberately
there
were
terrae
incognitae
in
every
continent
then
poland
sarmatia
lands
since
lost
and
many
a
voyage
i
made
with
a
blunted
pin
about
that
large
incorrect
and
dignified
world
the
books
in
that
little
old
closet
had
been
banished
i
suppose
from
the
saloon
during
the
victorian
revival
of
good
taste
and
emasculated
orthodoxy
but
my
mother
had
no
suspicion
of
their
character
so
i
read
and
understood
the
good
sound
rhetoric
of
tom
paine
s
rights
of
man
and
his
common
sense
excellent
books
once
praised
by
bishops
and
since
sedulously
lied
about
gulliver
was
there
unexpurgated
strong
meat
for
a
boy
perhaps
but
not
too
strong
i
hold
i
have
never
regretted
that
i
escaped
niceness
in
these
affairs
the
satire
of
traldragdubh
made
my
blood
boil
as
it
was
meant
to
do
but
i
hated
swift
for
the
houyhnhnms
and
never
quite
liked
a
horse
afterwards
then
i
remember
also
a
translation
of
voltaire
s
candide
and
rasselas
and
vast
book
though
it
was
i
really
believe
i
read
in
a
muzzy
sort
of
way
of
course
from
end
to
end
and
even
with
some
reference
now
and
then
to
the
atlas
gibbon
in
twelve
volumes
these
readings
whetted
my
taste
for
more
and
surreptitiously
i
raided
the
bookcases
in
the
big
saloon
i
got
through
quite
a
number
of
books
before
my
sacrilegious
temerity
was
discovered
by
ann
the
old
i
remember
that
among
others
i
tried
a
translation
of
plato
s
republic
then
and
found
extraordinarily
little
interest
in
it
i
was
much
too
young
for
that
but
vathek
vathek
was
glorious
stuff
that
kicking
affair
when
everybody
had
to
kick
the
thought
of
vathek
always
brings
back
with
it
my
boyish
memory
of
the
big
saloon
at
bladesover
it
was
a
huge
long
room
with
many
windows
opening
upon
the
park
and
each
window
there
were
a
dozen
or
more
reaching
from
the
floor
up
had
its
elaborate
silk
or
satin
curtains
heavily
fringed
a
canopy
is
it
above
its
completely
white
shutters
folding
into
the
deep
thickness
of
the
wall
at
either
end
of
that
great
still
place
was
an
immense
marble
the
end
by
the
bookcase
showed
the
wolf
and
romulus
and
remus
with
homer
and
virgil
for
supporters
the
design
of
the
other
end
i
have
forgotten
frederick
prince
of
wales
swaggered
flatly
over
the
one
twice
but
mellowed
by
the
surface
gleam
of
oil
and
over
the
other
was
an
equally
colossal
group
of
departed
drews
as
sylvan
deities
scantily
clad
against
a
sky
down
the
centre
of
the
elaborate
ceiling
were
three
chandeliers
each
bearing
some
hundreds
of
dangling
glass
lustres
and
over
the
interminable
carpet
it
impressed
me
as
about
as
big
as
sarmatia
in
the
atlas
were
islands
and
archipelagoes
of
chairs
and
couches
tables
great
sevres
vases
on
pedestals
a
bronze
man
and
horse
somewhere
in
this
wilderness
one
came
i
remember
upon
a
big
harp
beside
a
music
stand
and
a
grand
piano
the
raid
was
one
of
extraordinary
dash
and
danger
one
came
down
the
main
service
stairs
that
was
legal
and
illegality
began
in
a
little
landing
when
very
cautiously
one
went
through
a
red
baize
door
a
little
passage
led
to
the
hall
and
here
one
reconnoitered
for
ann
the
old
the
younger
housemaids
were
friendly
and
did
not
count
ann
located
came
a
dash
across
the
open
space
at
the
foot
of
that
great
staircase
that
has
never
been
properly
descended
since
powder
went
out
of
fashion
and
so
to
the
saloon
door
a
beast
of
an
oscillating
chinaman
in
china
as
large
as
life
grimaced
and
quivered
to
one
s
lightest
steps
that
door
was
the
perilous
place
it
was
double
with
the
thickness
of
the
wall
between
so
that
one
could
not
listen
beforehand
for
the
whisk
of
the
on
the
other
side
oddly
is
it
not
this
darting
into
enormous
places
in
pursuit
of
the
abandoned
crumbs
of
thought
and
i
found
langhorne
s
plutarch
too
i
remember
on
those
shelves
it
seems
queer
to
me
now
to
think
that
i
acquired
pride
and
the
idea
of
a
state
and
the
germ
of
public
spirit
in
such
a
furtive
fashion
queer
too
that
it
should
rest
with
an
old
greek
dead
these
eighteen
hundred
years
to
teach
that
vi
the
school
i
went
to
was
the
sort
of
school
the
bladesover
system
permitted
the
public
schools
that
add
comic
into
existence
in
the
brief
glow
of
the
renascence
had
been
taken
possession
of
by
the
ruling
class
the
lower
classes
were
not
supposed
to
stand
in
need
of
schools
and
our
middle
stratum
got
the
schools
it
deserved
private
schools
schools
any
unqualified
pretender
was
free
to
establish
mine
was
kept
by
a
man
who
had
had
the
energy
to
get
himself
a
college
of
preceptors
diploma
and
considering
how
cheap
his
charges
were
i
will
readily
admit
the
place
might
have
been
worse
the
building
was
a
dingy
residence
outside
the
village
with
the
schoolroom
as
an
outbuilding
of
lath
and
plaster
i
do
not
remember
that
my
were
unhappy
indeed
i
recall
a
good
lot
of
fine
mixed
fun
in
them
but
i
can
not
without
grave
risk
of
misinterpretation
declare
that
we
were
at
all
nice
and
refined
we
fought
much
not
sound
formal
fighting
but
scrapping
of
a
sincere
and
murderous
kind
into
which
one
might
bring
one
s
boots
it
made
us
tough
at
any
rate
and
several
of
us
were
the
sons
of
london
publicans
who
distinguished
scraps
where
one
meant
to
hurt
from
ordered
pugilism
practising
both
arts
and
having
moreover
precocious
linguistic
gifts
our
was
bald
about
the
wickets
and
we
played
without
style
and
disputed
with
the
umpire
and
the
teaching
was
chiefly
in
the
hands
of
a
lout
of
nineteen
who
wore
clothes
and
taught
despicably
the
and
proprietor
taught
us
arithmetic
algebra
and
euclid
and
to
the
older
boys
even
trigonometry
himself
he
had
a
strong
mathematical
bias
and
i
think
now
that
by
the
standard
of
a
british
public
school
he
did
rather
well
by
us
we
had
one
inestimable
privilege
at
that
school
and
that
was
spiritual
neglect
we
dealt
with
one
another
with
the
forcible
simplicity
of
natural
boys
we
cheeked
and
punched
and
clouted
we
thought
ourselves
red
indians
and
cowboys
and
honourable
things
and
not
young
english
gentlemen
we
never
felt
the
strain
of
onward
christian
soldiers
nor
were
swayed
by
any
premature
piety
in
the
cold
oak
pew
of
our
sunday
devotions
all
that
was
good
we
spent
our
rare
pennies
in
the
uncensored
reading
matter
of
the
village
dame
s
shop
on
the
boys
of
england
and
honest
penny
dreadfuls
ripping
stuff
stuff
that
anticipated
haggard
and
stevenson
badly
printed
and
queerly
illustrated
and
very
very
good
for
us
on
our
we
were
allowed
the
unusual
freedom
of
rambling
in
twos
and
threes
wide
and
far
about
the
land
talking
experimentally
dreaming
wildly
there
was
much
in
those
walks
to
this
day
the
landscape
of
the
kentish
world
with
its
low
broad
distances
its
hop
gardens
and
golden
stretches
of
wheat
its
oasts
and
square
church
towers
its
background
of
downland
and
hangers
has
for
me
a
faint
sense
of
adventure
added
to
the
pleasure
of
its
beauty
we
smoked
on
occasion
but
nobody
put
us
up
to
the
proper
boyish
things
to
do
we
never
robbed
an
orchard
for
example
though
there
were
orchards
all
about
us
we
thought
stealing
was
sinful
we
stole
incidental
apples
and
turnips
and
strawberries
from
the
fields
indeed
but
in
a
criminal
inglorious
fashion
and
afterwards
we
were
ashamed
we
had
our
days
of
adventure
but
they
were
natural
accidents
our
own
adventures
there
was
one
hot
day
when
several
of
us
walking
out
towards
maidstone
were
incited
by
the
devil
to
despise
ginger
beer
and
we
fuddled
ourselves
dreadfully
with
ale
and
a
time
when
our
young
minds
were
infected
to
the
pitch
of
buying
pistols
by
the
legend
of
the
wild
west
young
roots
from
highbury
came
back
with
a
revolver
and
cartridges
and
we
went
off
six
strong
to
live
a
free
wild
life
one
holiday
afternoon
we
fired
our
first
shot
deep
in
the
old
flint
mine
at
chiselstead
and
nearly
burst
our
ear
drums
then
we
fired
in
a
primrose
studded
wood
by
pickthorn
green
and
i
gave
a
false
alarm
of
keeper
and
we
fled
in
disorder
for
a
mile
after
which
roots
suddenly
shot
at
a
pheasant
in
the
high
road
by
chiselstead
and
then
young
barker
told
lies
about
the
severity
of
the
game
laws
and
made
roots
sore
afraid
and
we
hid
the
pistol
in
a
dry
ditch
outside
the
school
field
a
day
or
so
after
we
got
in
again
and
ignoring
a
certain
fouling
and
rusting
of
the
barrel
tried
for
a
rabbit
at
three
hundred
yards
young
roots
blew
a
molehill
at
twenty
paces
into
a
dust
cloud
burnt
his
fingers
and
scorched
his
face
and
the
weapon
having
once
displayed
this
strange
disposition
to
flame
back
upon
the
shooter
was
not
subsequently
fired
one
main
source
of
excitement
for
us
was
cheeking
people
in
vans
and
carts
upon
the
goudhurst
road
and
getting
myself
into
a
monstrous
white
mess
in
the
chalk
pits
beyond
the
village
and
catching
yellow
jaundice
as
a
sequel
to
bathing
stark
naked
with
three
other
adamites
old
ewart
leading
that
function
in
the
rivulet
across
hickson
s
meadows
are
among
my
memorabilia
those
free
imaginative
afternoons
how
much
they
were
for
us
how
much
they
did
for
us
all
streams
came
from
the
then
undiscovered
sources
of
the
nile
in
those
days
all
thickets
were
indian
jungles
and
our
best
game
i
say
it
with
pride
i
invented
i
got
it
out
of
the
bladesover
saloon
we
found
a
wood
where
trespassing
was
forbidden
and
did
the
retreat
of
the
ten
thousand
through
it
from
end
to
end
cutting
our
way
bravely
through
a
host
of
nettle
beds
that
barred
our
path
and
not
forgetting
to
weep
and
kneel
when
at
last
we
emerged
within
sight
of
the
high
road
sea
so
we
have
burst
at
times
weeping
and
rejoicing
upon
startled
wayfarers
usually
i
took
the
part
of
that
distinguished
general
xenophen
and
please
note
the
quantity
of
the
i
have
all
my
classical
names
like
that
socrates
rhymes
with
bates
for
me
and
except
when
the
bleak
eye
of
some
scholar
warns
me
of
his
standards
of
judgment
i
use
those
dear
old
mispronunciations
still
the
little
splash
into
latin
made
during
my
days
as
a
chemist
washed
off
nothing
of
the
habit
well
if
i
met
those
great
gentlemen
of
the
past
with
their
accents
carelessly
adjusted
i
did
at
least
meet
them
alive
as
an
equal
and
in
a
living
tongue
altogether
my
school
might
easily
have
been
worse
for
me
and
among
other
good
things
it
gave
me
a
friend
who
has
lasted
my
life
out
this
was
ewart
who
is
now
a
monumental
artist
at
woking
after
many
vicissitudes
dear
chap
how
he
did
stick
out
of
his
clothes
to
be
sure
he
was
a
longlimbed
lout
ridiculously
tall
beside
my
more
youth
full
compactness
and
except
that
there
was
no
black
moustache
under
his
nose
blob
he
had
the
same
round
knobby
face
as
he
has
the
same
bright
and
active
hazel
brown
eyes
the
stare
the
meditative
moment
the
insinuating
reply
surely
no
boy
ever
played
the
fool
as
bob
ewart
used
to
play
it
no
boy
had
a
readier
knack
of
mantling
the
world
with
wonder
commonness
vanished
before
ewart
at
his
expository
touch
all
things
became
memorable
and
rare
from
him
i
first
heard
tell
of
love
but
only
after
its
barbs
were
already
sticking
in
my
heart
he
was
i
know
now
the
bastard
of
that
great
improvident
artist
rickmann
ewart
he
brought
the
light
of
a
lax
world
that
at
least
had
not
turned
its
back
upon
beauty
into
the
growing
fermentation
of
my
mind
i
won
his
heart
by
a
version
of
vathek
and
after
that
we
were
inseparable
yarning
friends
we
merged
our
intellectual
stock
so
completely
that
i
wonder
sometimes
how
much
i
did
not
become
ewart
how
much
ewart
is
not
vicariously
and
derivatively
me
vii
and
then
when
i
had
newly
passed
my
fourteenth
birthday
came
my
tragic
disgrace
it
was
in
my
midsummer
holidays
that
the
thing
happened
and
it
was
through
the
honourable
beatrice
normandy
she
had
come
into
my
life
as
they
say
before
i
was
twelve
she
descended
unexpectedly
into
a
peaceful
interlude
that
followed
the
annual
going
of
those
three
great
women
she
came
into
the
old
nursery
upstairs
and
every
day
she
had
tea
with
us
in
the
housekeeper
s
room
she
was
eight
and
she
came
with
a
nurse
called
nannie
and
to
begin
with
i
did
not
like
her
at
all
nobody
liked
this
irruption
into
the
downstairs
rooms
the
two
gave
trouble
a
dire
offence
nannie
s
sense
of
duty
to
her
charge
led
to
requests
and
demands
that
took
my
mother
s
breath
away
eggs
at
unusual
times
the
reboiling
of
milk
the
rejection
of
an
excellent
milk
pudding
not
negotiated
respectfully
but
dictated
as
of
right
nannie
was
a
dark
longfeatured
taciturn
woman
in
a
grey
dress
she
had
a
furtive
inflexibility
of
manner
that
finally
dismayed
and
crushed
and
overcame
she
conveyed
she
was
under
orders
like
a
greek
tragedy
she
was
that
strange
product
of
the
old
time
a
devoted
trusted
servant
she
had
as
it
were
banked
all
her
pride
and
will
with
the
greater
more
powerful
people
who
employed
her
in
return
for
a
security
of
servitude
the
bargain
was
nonetheless
binding
for
being
implicit
finally
they
were
to
pension
her
and
she
would
die
the
hated
treasure
of
a
she
had
built
up
in
herself
an
enormous
habit
of
reference
to
these
upstairs
people
she
had
curbed
down
all
discordant
murmurings
of
her
soul
her
very
instincts
were
perverted
or
surrendered
she
was
sexless
her
personal
pride
was
all
transferred
she
mothered
another
woman
s
child
with
a
hard
joyless
devotion
that
was
at
least
entirely
compatible
with
a
stoical
separation
she
treated
us
all
as
things
that
counted
for
nothing
save
to
fetch
and
carry
for
her
charge
but
the
honourable
beatrice
could
condescend
the
queer
chances
of
later
years
come
between
me
and
a
distinctly
separated
memory
of
that
childish
face
when
i
think
of
beatrice
i
think
of
her
as
i
came
to
know
her
at
a
later
time
when
at
last
i
came
to
know
her
so
well
that
indeed
now
i
could
draw
her
and
show
a
hundred
little
delicate
things
you
would
miss
in
looking
at
her
but
even
then
i
remember
how
i
noted
the
infinite
delicacy
of
her
childish
skin
and
the
fine
eyebrow
finer
than
the
finest
feather
that
ever
one
felt
on
the
breast
of
a
bird
she
was
one
of
those
elfin
rather
precocious
little
girls
quick
coloured
with
dark
hair
naturally
curling
dusky
hair
that
was
sometimes
astray
over
her
eyes
and
eyes
that
were
sometimes
impishly
dark
and
sometimes
a
clear
brown
yellow
and
from
the
very
outset
after
a
most
cursory
attention
to
rabbits
she
decided
that
the
only
really
interesting
thing
at
the
was
myself
the
elders
talked
in
their
formal
dull
way
telling
nannie
the
trite
old
things
about
the
park
and
the
village
that
they
told
every
one
and
beatrice
watched
me
across
the
table
with
a
pitiless
little
curiosity
that
made
me
uncomfortable
nannie
she
said
pointing
and
nannie
left
a
question
of
my
mother
s
disregarded
to
attend
to
her
is
he
a
servant
boy
said
nannie
he
s
master
is
he
a
servant
boy
repeated
beatrice
he
s
a
schoolboy
said
my
mother
then
may
i
talk
to
him
nannie
nannie
surveyed
me
with
brutal
inhumanity
you
mustn
t
talk
too
much
she
said
to
her
charge
and
cut
cake
into
fingers
for
her
no
she
added
decisively
as
beatrice
made
to
speak
beatrice
became
malignant
her
eyes
explored
me
with
unjustifiable
hostility
he
s
got
dirty
hands
she
said
stabbing
at
the
forbidden
fruit
and
there
s
a
fray
to
his
then
she
gave
herself
up
to
cake
with
an
appearance
of
entire
forgetfulness
of
me
that
filled
me
with
hate
and
a
passionate
desire
to
compel
her
to
admire
me
and
the
next
day
before
tea
i
did
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
freely
without
command
or
any
compulsion
wash
my
hands
so
our
acquaintance
began
and
presently
was
deepened
by
a
whim
of
hers
she
had
a
cold
and
was
kept
indoors
and
confronted
nannie
suddenly
with
the
alternative
of
being
hopelessly
naughty
which
in
her
case
involved
a
generous
amount
of
screaming
unsuitable
for
the
ears
of
an
elderly
shaky
rich
aunt
or
having
me
up
to
the
nursery
to
play
with
her
all
the
afternoon
nannie
came
downstairs
and
borrowed
me
in
a
careworn
manner
and
i
was
handed
over
to
the
little
creature
as
if
i
was
some
large
variety
of
kitten
i
had
never
had
anything
to
do
with
a
little
girl
before
i
thought
she
was
more
beautiful
and
wonderful
and
bright
than
anything
else
could
possibly
be
in
life
and
she
found
me
the
gentlest
of
slaves
though
at
the
same
time
as
i
made
evident
fairly
strong
and
nannie
was
amazed
to
find
the
afternoon
slip
cheerfully
and
rapidly
away
she
praised
my
manners
to
lady
drew
and
to
my
mother
who
said
she
was
glad
to
hear
well
of
me
and
after
that
i
played
with
beatrice
several
times
the
toys
she
had
remain
in
my
memory
still
as
great
splendid
things
gigantic
to
all
my
previous
experience
of
toys
and
we
even
went
to
the
great
doll
s
house
on
the
nursery
landing
to
play
discreetly
with
that
the
great
doll
s
house
that
the
prince
regent
had
given
sir
harry
drew
s
who
died
at
five
that
was
a
not
ineffectual
model
of
bladesover
itself
and
contained
dolls
and
had
cost
hundreds
of
pounds
i
played
under
imperious
direction
with
that
toy
of
glory
i
went
back
to
school
when
that
holiday
was
over
dreaming
of
beautiful
things
and
got
ewart
to
talk
to
me
of
love
and
i
made
a
great
story
out
of
the
doll
s
house
a
story
that
taken
over
into
ewart
s
hands
speedily
grew
to
an
island
doll
s
city
all
our
own
one
of
the
dolls
i
privately
decided
was
like
beatrice
one
other
holiday
there
was
when
i
saw
something
of
her
oddly
enough
my
memory
of
that
second
holiday
in
which
she
played
a
part
is
vague
and
then
came
a
gap
of
a
year
and
then
my
disgrace
viii
now
i
sit
down
to
write
my
story
and
tell
over
again
things
in
their
order
i
find
for
the
first
time
how
inconsecutive
and
irrational
a
thing
the
memory
can
be
one
recalls
acts
and
can
not
recall
motives
one
recalls
quite
vividly
moments
that
stand
out
inexplicably
things
adrift
joining
on
to
nothing
leading
nowhere
i
think
i
must
have
seen
beatrice
and
her
quite
a
number
of
times
in
my
last
holiday
at
bladesover
but
i
really
can
not
recall
more
than
a
little
of
the
quality
of
the
circumstances
that
great
crisis
of
my
boyhood
stands
out
very
vividly
as
an
effect
as
a
sort
of
cardinal
thing
for
me
but
when
i
look
for
details
particularly
details
that
led
up
to
the
crisis
i
can
not
find
them
in
any
developing
order
at
all
this
halfbrother
archie
garvell
was
a
new
factor
in
the
affair
i
remember
him
clearly
as
a
supercilious
looking
boy
much
taller
than
i
but
i
should
imagine
very
little
heavier
and
that
we
hated
each
other
by
a
sort
of
instinct
from
the
beginning
and
yet
i
can
not
remember
my
first
meeting
with
him
at
all
looking
back
into
these
past
things
it
is
like
rummaging
in
a
neglected
attic
that
has
experienced
the
attentions
of
some
whimsical
robber
i
can
not
even
account
for
the
presence
of
these
children
at
bladesover
they
were
i
know
among
the
innumerable
cousins
of
lady
drew
and
according
to
the
theories
of
downstairs
candidates
for
the
ultimate
possession
of
bladesover
if
they
were
their
candidature
was
unsuccessful
but
that
great
place
with
all
its
faded
splendour
its
fine
furniture
its
large
traditions
was
entirely
at
the
old
lady
s
disposition
and
i
am
inclined
to
think
it
is
true
that
she
used
this
fact
to
torment
and
dominate
a
number
of
eligible
people
lord
osprey
was
among
the
number
of
these
and
she
showed
these
hospitalities
to
his
motherless
child
and
partly
no
doubt
because
he
was
poor
but
quite
as
much
i
nowadays
imagine
in
the
dim
hope
of
finding
some
affectionate
or
imaginative
outcome
of
contact
with
them
nannie
had
dropped
out
of
the
world
this
second
time
and
beatrice
was
in
the
charge
of
an
extremely
amiable
and
ineffectual
poor
young
woman
whose
name
i
never
knew
they
were
i
think
two
remarkably
illmanaged
and
enterprising
children
i
seem
to
remember
too
that
it
was
understood
that
i
was
not
a
fit
companion
for
them
and
that
our
meetings
had
to
be
as
unostentatious
as
possible
it
was
beatrice
who
insisted
upon
our
meeting
i
am
certain
i
knew
quite
a
lot
about
love
at
fourteen
and
that
i
was
quite
as
much
in
love
with
beatrice
then
as
any
impassioned
adult
could
be
and
that
beatrice
was
in
her
way
in
love
with
me
it
is
part
of
the
decent
and
useful
pretences
of
our
world
that
children
of
the
age
at
which
we
were
think
nothing
feel
nothing
know
nothing
of
love
it
is
wonderful
what
people
the
english
are
for
keeping
up
pretences
but
indeed
i
can
not
avoid
telling
that
beatrice
and
i
talked
of
love
and
kissed
and
embraced
one
another
i
recall
something
of
one
talk
under
the
overhanging
bushes
of
the
shrubbery
i
on
the
park
side
of
the
stone
wall
and
the
lady
of
my
worship
a
little
inelegantly
astride
thereon
inelegantly
do
i
say
you
should
have
seen
the
sweet
imp
as
i
remember
her
just
her
poise
on
the
wall
comes
suddenly
clear
before
me
and
behind
her
the
light
various
branches
of
the
bushes
of
the
shrubbery
that
my
feet
might
not
profane
and
far
away
and
high
behind
her
dim
and
stately
the
cornice
of
the
great
facade
of
bladesover
rose
against
the
dappled
sky
our
talk
must
have
been
serious
and
for
we
were
discussing
my
social
position
i
don
t
love
archie
she
had
said
apropos
of
nothing
and
then
in
a
whisper
leaning
forward
with
the
hair
about
her
face
i
love
you
but
she
had
been
a
little
pressing
to
have
it
clear
that
i
was
not
and
could
not
be
a
servant
you
ll
never
be
a
servant
ever
i
swore
that
very
readily
and
it
is
a
vow
i
have
kept
by
nature
what
will
you
be
said
she
i
ran
my
mind
hastily
over
the
professions
will
you
be
a
soldier
she
asked
and
be
bawled
at
by
duffers
no
fear
said
i
leave
that
to
the
but
an
officer
i
don
t
know
i
said
evading
a
shameful
difficulty
i
d
rather
go
into
the
wouldn
t
you
like
to
fight
i
d
like
to
fight
i
said
but
a
common
soldier
it
s
no
honour
to
have
to
be
told
to
fight
and
to
be
looked
down
upon
while
you
do
it
and
how
could
i
be
an
officer
couldn
t
you
be
she
said
and
looked
at
me
doubtfully
and
the
spaces
of
the
social
system
opened
between
us
then
as
became
a
male
of
spirit
i
took
upon
myself
to
brag
and
lie
my
way
through
this
trouble
i
said
i
was
a
poor
man
and
poor
men
went
into
the
navy
that
i
knew
mathematics
which
no
army
officer
did
and
i
claimed
nelson
for
an
exemplar
and
spoke
very
highly
of
my
outlook
upon
blue
water
he
loved
lady
hamilton
i
said
although
she
was
a
lady
and
i
will
love
we
were
somewhere
near
that
when
the
egregious
governess
became
audible
calling
snifty
beast
said
my
lady
and
tried
to
get
on
with
the
conversation
but
that
governess
made
things
impossible
come
here
said
my
lady
suddenly
holding
out
a
grubby
hand
and
i
went
very
close
to
her
and
she
put
her
little
head
down
upon
the
wall
until
her
black
fog
of
hair
tickled
my
cheek
you
are
my
humble
faithful
lover
she
demanded
in
a
whisper
her
warm
flushed
face
near
touching
mine
and
her
eyes
very
dark
and
lustrous
i
am
your
humble
faithful
lover
i
whispered
back
and
she
put
her
arm
about
my
head
and
put
out
her
lips
and
we
kissed
and
boy
though
i
was
i
was
all
atremble
so
we
two
kissed
for
the
first
time
fearfully
close
my
lady
had
vanished
with
one
wild
kick
of
her
leg
a
moment
after
i
heard
her
sustaining
the
reproaches
of
her
governess
and
explaining
her
failure
to
answer
with
an
admirable
lucidity
and
disingenuousness
i
felt
it
was
unnecessary
for
me
to
be
seen
just
then
and
i
vanished
guiltily
round
the
corner
into
the
west
wood
and
so
to
and
play
wandering
along
one
of
those
meandering
bracken
valleys
that
varied
bladesover
park
and
that
day
and
for
many
days
that
kiss
upon
my
lips
was
a
seal
and
by
night
the
seed
of
dreams
then
i
remember
an
expedition
we
made
she
i
and
her
into
those
west
woods
they
two
were
supposed
to
be
playing
in
the
shrubbery
and
how
we
were
indians
there
and
made
a
wigwam
out
of
a
pile
of
beech
logs
and
how
we
stalked
deer
crept
near
and
watched
rabbits
feeding
in
a
glade
and
almost
got
a
squirrel
it
was
play
seasoned
with
plentiful
disputing
between
me
and
young
garvell
for
each
firmly
insisted
upon
the
leading
roles
and
only
my
wider
reading
i
had
read
ten
stories
to
his
one
gave
me
the
ascendency
over
him
also
i
scored
over
him
by
knowing
how
to
find
the
eagle
in
a
bracken
stem
and
somehow
i
don
t
remember
what
led
to
it
at
all
i
and
beatrice
two
hot
and
ruffled
creatures
crept
in
among
the
tall
bracken
and
hid
from
him
the
great
fronds
rose
above
us
five
feet
or
more
and
as
i
had
learnt
how
to
wriggle
through
that
undergrowth
with
the
minimum
of
betrayal
by
tossing
greenery
above
i
led
the
way
the
ground
under
bracken
is
beautifully
clear
and
faintly
scented
in
warm
weather
the
stems
come
up
black
and
then
green
if
you
crawl
flat
it
is
a
tropical
forest
in
miniature
i
led
the
way
and
beatrice
crawled
behind
and
then
as
the
green
of
the
further
glade
opened
before
us
stopped
she
crawled
up
to
me
her
hot
little
face
came
close
to
mine
once
more
she
looked
and
breathed
close
to
me
and
suddenly
she
flung
her
arm
about
my
neck
and
dragged
me
to
earth
beside
her
and
kissed
me
and
kissed
me
again
we
kissed
we
embraced
and
kissed
again
all
without
a
word
we
desisted
we
stared
and
hesitated
then
in
a
suddenly
damped
mood
and
a
little
perplexed
at
ourselves
crawled
out
to
be
presently
run
down
and
caught
in
the
tamest
way
by
archie
that
comes
back
very
clearly
to
me
and
other
vague
memories
i
know
old
hall
and
his
gun
out
shooting
at
jackdaws
came
into
our
common
experiences
but
i
don
t
remember
how
and
then
at
last
abruptly
our
fight
in
the
warren
stands
out
the
warren
like
most
places
in
england
that
have
that
name
was
not
particularly
a
warren
it
was
a
long
slope
of
thorns
and
beeches
through
which
a
path
ran
and
made
an
alternative
route
to
the
downhill
carriage
road
between
bladesover
and
ropedean
i
don
t
know
how
we
three
got
there
but
i
have
an
uncertain
fancy
it
was
connected
with
a
visit
paid
by
the
governess
to
the
ropedean
vicarage
people
but
suddenly
archie
and
i
in
discussing
a
game
fell
into
a
dispute
for
beatrice
i
had
made
him
the
fairest
offer
i
was
to
be
a
spanish
nobleman
she
was
to
be
my
wife
and
he
was
to
be
a
tribe
of
indians
trying
to
carry
her
off
it
seems
to
me
a
fairly
attractive
offer
to
a
boy
to
be
a
whole
tribe
of
indians
with
a
chance
of
such
a
booty
but
archie
suddenly
took
offence
no
he
said
we
can
t
have
that
can
t
have
what
you
can
t
be
a
gentleman
because
you
aren
t
and
you
can
t
play
beatrice
is
your
wife
it
s
it
s
but
i
said
and
looked
at
her
some
earlier
grudge
in
the
day
s
affairs
must
have
been
in
archie
s
mind
we
let
you
play
with
us
said
archie
but
we
can
t
have
things
like
what
rot
said
beatrice
he
can
if
he
but
he
carried
his
point
i
let
him
carry
it
and
only
began
to
grow
angry
three
or
four
minutes
later
then
we
were
still
discussing
play
and
disputing
about
another
game
nothing
seemed
right
for
all
of
us
we
don
t
want
you
to
play
with
us
at
all
said
archie
yes
we
do
said
beatrice
he
drops
his
aitches
like
no
e
doesn
t
said
i
in
the
heat
of
the
moment
there
you
go
he
cried
e
he
says
e
e
e
he
pointed
a
finger
at
me
he
had
struck
to
the
heart
of
my
shame
i
made
the
only
possible
reply
by
a
rush
at
him
hello
he
cried
at
my
blackavised
attack
he
dropped
back
into
an
attitude
that
had
some
style
in
it
parried
my
blow
got
back
at
my
cheek
and
laughed
with
surprise
and
relief
at
his
own
success
whereupon
i
became
a
thing
of
murderous
rage
he
could
box
as
well
or
better
than
i
he
had
yet
to
realise
i
knew
anything
of
that
at
all
but
i
had
fought
once
or
twice
to
a
finish
with
bare
fists
i
was
used
to
inflicting
and
enduring
savage
hurting
and
i
doubt
if
he
had
ever
fought
i
hadn
t
fought
ten
seconds
before
i
felt
this
softness
in
him
realised
all
that
quality
of
modern
england
that
never
goes
to
the
quick
that
hedges
about
rules
and
those
petty
points
of
honour
that
are
the
ultimate
comminution
of
honour
that
claims
credit
for
things
demonstrably
half
done
he
seemed
to
think
that
first
hit
of
his
and
one
or
two
others
were
going
to
matter
that
i
ought
to
give
in
when
presently
my
lip
bled
and
dripped
blood
upon
my
clothes
so
before
we
had
been
at
it
a
minute
he
had
ceased
to
be
aggressive
except
in
momentary
spurts
and
i
was
knocking
him
about
almost
as
i
wanted
to
do
and
demanding
breathlessly
and
fiercely
after
our
school
manner
whether
he
had
had
enough
not
knowing
that
by
his
high
code
and
his
soft
training
it
was
equally
impossible
for
him
to
either
and
beat
me
or
give
in
i
have
a
very
distinct
impression
of
beatrice
dancing
about
us
during
the
affair
in
a
state
of
unladylike
appreciation
but
i
was
too
preoccupied
to
hear
much
of
what
she
was
saying
but
she
certainly
backed
us
both
and
i
am
inclined
to
think
now
it
may
be
the
disillusionment
of
my
ripened
years
whichever
she
thought
was
winning
then
young
garvell
giving
way
before
my
slogging
stumbled
and
fell
over
a
big
flint
and
i
still
following
the
tradition
of
my
class
and
school
promptly
flung
myself
on
him
to
finish
him
we
were
busy
with
each
other
on
the
ground
when
we
became
aware
of
a
dreadful
interruption
shut
up
you
fool
said
archie
oh
lady
drew
i
heard
beatrice
cry
they
re
fighting
they
re
fighting
something
awful
i
looked
over
my
shoulder
archie
s
wish
to
get
up
became
irresistible
and
my
resolve
to
go
on
with
him
vanished
altogether
i
became
aware
of
the
two
old
ladies
presences
of
black
and
purple
silk
and
fur
and
shining
dark
things
they
had
walked
up
through
the
warren
while
the
horses
took
the
hill
easily
and
so
had
come
upon
us
beatrice
had
gone
to
them
at
once
with
an
air
of
taking
refuge
and
stood
beside
and
a
little
behind
them
we
both
rose
dejectedly
the
two
old
ladies
were
evidently
quite
dreadfully
shocked
and
peering
at
us
with
their
poor
old
eyes
and
never
had
i
seen
such
a
tremblement
in
lady
drew
s
lorgnettes
you
ve
never
been
fighting
said
lady
drew
you
have
been
it
wasn
t
proper
fighting
snapped
archie
with
accusing
eyes
on
me
it
s
ponderevo
s
george
said
miss
somerville
so
adding
a
conviction
for
ingratitude
to
my
evident
sacrilege
how
could
he
dare
cried
lady
drew
becoming
very
awful
he
broke
the
rules
said
archie
sobbing
for
breath
i
slipped
and
he
hit
me
while
i
was
down
he
knelt
on
how
could
you
dare
said
lady
drew
i
produced
an
experienced
handkerchief
rolled
up
into
a
tight
ball
and
wiped
the
blood
from
my
chin
but
i
offered
no
explanation
of
my
daring
among
other
things
that
prevented
that
i
was
too
short
of
breath
he
didn
t
fight
fair
sobbed
archie
beatrice
from
behind
the
old
ladies
regarded
me
intently
and
without
hostility
i
am
inclined
to
think
the
modification
of
my
face
through
the
damage
to
my
lip
interested
her
it
became
dimly
apparent
to
my
confused
intelligence
that
i
must
not
say
these
two
had
been
playing
with
me
that
would
not
be
after
the
rules
of
their
game
i
resolved
in
this
difficult
situation
upon
a
sulky
silence
and
to
take
whatever
consequences
might
follow
ix
the
powers
of
justice
in
bladesover
made
an
extraordinary
mess
of
my
case
i
have
regretfully
to
admit
that
the
honourable
beatrice
normandy
did
at
the
age
of
ten
betray
me
abandon
me
and
lie
most
abominably
about
me
she
was
as
a
matter
of
fact
about
me
conscience
stricken
too
she
bolted
from
the
very
thought
of
my
being
her
affianced
lover
and
so
forth
from
the
faintest
memory
of
kissing
she
was
indeed
altogether
disgraceful
and
human
in
her
betrayal
she
and
her
lied
in
perfect
concord
and
i
was
presented
as
a
wanton
assailant
of
my
social
betters
they
were
waiting
about
in
the
warren
when
i
came
up
and
spoke
to
them
etc
on
the
whole
i
now
perceive
lady
drew
s
decisions
were
in
the
light
of
the
evidence
reasonable
and
merciful
they
were
conveyed
to
me
by
my
mother
who
was
i
really
believe
even
more
shocked
by
the
grossness
of
my
social
insubordination
than
lady
drew
she
dilated
on
her
ladyship
s
kindnesses
to
me
on
the
effrontery
and
wickedness
of
my
procedure
and
so
came
at
last
to
the
terms
of
my
penance
you
must
go
up
to
young
garvell
and
beg
his
i
won
t
beg
his
pardon
i
said
speaking
for
the
first
time
my
mother
paused
incredulous
i
folded
my
arms
on
her
and
delivered
my
wicked
little
ultimatum
i
won
t
beg
his
pardon
nohow
i
said
see
then
you
will
have
to
go
off
to
your
uncle
frapp
at
i
don
t
care
where
i
have
to
go
or
what
i
have
to
do
i
won
t
beg
his
pardon
i
said
and
i
didn
t
after
that
i
was
one
against
the
world
perhaps
in
my
mother
s
heart
there
lurked
some
pity
for
me
but
she
did
not
show
it
she
took
the
side
of
the
young
gentleman
she
tried
hard
she
tried
very
hard
to
make
me
say
i
was
sorry
i
had
struck
him
sorry
i
couldn
t
explain
so
i
went
into
exile
in
the
to
redwood
station
with
jukes
the
coachman
coldly
silent
driving
me
and
all
my
personal
belongings
in
a
small
american
cloth
portmanteau
behind
i
felt
i
had
much
to
embitter
me
the
game
had
and
the
beginnings
of
fairness
by
any
standards
i
knew
but
the
thing
that
embittered
me
most
was
that
the
honourable
beatrice
normandy
should
have
repudiated
and
fled
from
me
as
though
i
was
some
sort
of
leper
and
not
even
have
taken
a
chance
or
so
to
give
me
a
she
might
have
done
that
anyhow
supposing
i
had
told
on
her
but
the
son
of
a
servant
counts
as
a
servant
she
had
forgotten
and
now
remembered
i
solaced
myself
with
some
extraordinary
dream
of
coming
back
to
bladesover
stern
powerful
after
the
fashion
of
coriolanus
i
do
not
recall
the
details
but
i
have
no
doubt
i
displayed
great
magnanimity
well
anyhow
i
never
said
i
was
sorry
for
pounding
young
garvell
and
i
am
not
sorry
to
this
day
chapter
the
second
of
my
launch
into
the
world
and
the
last
i
saw
of
bladesover
i
when
i
was
thus
banished
from
bladesover
house
as
it
was
then
thought
for
good
and
all
i
was
sent
by
my
mother
in
a
vindictive
spirit
first
to
her
cousin
nicodemus
frapp
and
then
as
a
fully
indentured
apprentice
to
my
uncle
ponderevo
i
ran
away
from
the
care
of
my
cousin
nicodemus
back
to
bladesover
house
my
cousin
nicodemus
frapp
was
a
baker
in
a
back
street
a
slum
rather
just
off
that
miserable
narrow
mean
high
road
that
threads
those
exquisite
beads
rochester
and
chatham
he
was
i
must
admit
a
shock
to
me
much
dominated
by
a
young
plump
prolific
malingering
wife
a
bent
unwilling
dark
man
with
flour
in
his
hair
and
eyelashes
in
the
lines
of
his
face
and
the
seams
of
his
coat
i
ve
never
had
a
chance
to
correct
my
early
impression
of
him
and
he
still
remains
an
almost
dreadful
memory
a
sort
of
caricature
of
incompetent
simplicity
as
i
remember
him
indeed
he
presented
the
servile
tradition
perfected
he
had
no
pride
in
his
person
fine
clothes
and
dressing
up
wasn
t
for
the
likes
of
him
so
that
he
got
his
wife
who
was
no
artist
at
it
to
cut
his
black
hair
at
irregular
intervals
and
let
his
nails
become
disagreeable
to
the
fastidious
eye
he
had
no
pride
in
his
business
nor
any
initiative
his
only
virtues
were
not
doing
certain
things
and
hard
work
your
uncle
said
my
mother
all
cousins
were
uncles
by
courtesy
among
the
victorian
isn
t
much
to
look
at
or
talk
to
but
he
s
a
good
there
was
a
sort
of
base
honourableness
about
toil
however
needless
in
that
system
of
inversion
another
point
of
honour
was
to
rise
at
or
before
dawn
and
then
laboriously
muddle
about
it
was
very
distinctly
impressed
on
my
mind
that
the
good
man
would
have
thought
it
to
own
a
pocket
handkerchief
poor
old
frapp
dirty
and
crushed
by
product
of
bladesover
s
magnificence
he
made
no
fight
against
the
world
at
all
he
was
floundering
in
small
debts
that
were
not
so
small
but
that
finally
they
overwhelmed
him
whenever
there
was
occasion
for
any
exertion
his
wife
fell
back
upon
pains
and
her
condition
and
god
sent
them
many
children
most
of
whom
died
and
so
by
their
coming
and
going
gave
a
double
exercise
in
the
virtues
of
submission
resignation
to
god
s
will
was
the
common
device
of
these
people
in
the
face
of
every
duty
and
every
emergency
there
were
no
books
in
the
house
i
doubt
if
either
of
them
had
retained
the
capacity
for
reading
consecutively
for
more
than
a
minute
or
so
and
it
was
with
amazement
that
day
after
day
over
and
above
stale
bread
one
beheld
food
and
again
more
food
amidst
the
litter
that
held
permanent
session
on
the
table
one
might
have
doubted
if
either
of
them
felt
discomfort
in
this
dusty
darkness
of
existence
if
it
was
not
that
they
did
visibly
seek
consolation
they
sought
this
and
found
it
of
a
sunday
not
in
strong
drink
and
raving
but
in
imaginary
draughts
of
blood
they
met
with
twenty
or
thirty
other
darkened
and
unclean
people
all
dressed
in
dingy
colours
that
would
not
show
the
dirt
in
a
little
chapel
equipped
with
a
spavined
roarer
of
a
harmonium
and
there
solaced
their
minds
on
the
thought
that
all
that
was
fair
and
free
in
life
all
that
struggled
all
that
planned
and
made
all
pride
and
beauty
and
honour
all
fine
and
enjoyable
things
were
irrevocably
damned
to
everlasting
torments
they
were
the
confidants
of
god
s
mockery
of
his
own
creation
so
at
any
rate
they
stick
in
my
mind
vaguer
and
yet
hardly
less
agreeable
than
this
cosmic
jest
this
coming
yah
clever
and
general
serving
out
and
showing
up
of
the
lucky
the
bold
and
the
cheerful
was
their
own
predestination
to
glory
there
is
a
fountain
filled
with
blood
drawn
from
emmanuel
s
veins
so
they
sang
i
hear
the
drone
and
wheeze
of
that
hymn
now
i
hated
them
with
the
bitter
uncharitable
condemnation
of
boyhood
and
a
twinge
of
that
hate
comes
back
to
me
as
i
write
the
words
the
sounds
and
then
the
scene
return
these
obscure
undignified
people
a
fat
woman
with
asthma
an
old
welsh
with
a
tumour
on
his
bald
head
who
was
the
intellectual
leader
of
the
sect
a
haberdasher
with
a
big
black
beard
a
extraordinarily
pregnant
woman
his
wife
a
spectacled
rate
collector
with
a
bent
back
i
hear
the
talk
about
souls
the
strange
battered
old
phrases
that
were
coined
ages
ago
in
the
seaports
of
the
levant
of
balm
of
gilead
and
manna
in
the
desert
of
gourds
that
give
shade
and
water
in
a
thirsty
land
i
recall
again
the
way
in
which
at
the
conclusion
of
the
service
the
talk
remained
pious
in
form
but
became
medical
in
substance
and
how
the
women
got
together
for
obstetric
whisperings
i
as
a
boy
did
not
matter
and
might
overhear
if
bladesover
is
my
key
for
the
explanation
of
england
i
think
my
invincible
persuasion
that
i
understand
russia
was
engendered
by
the
circle
of
uncle
frapp
i
slept
in
a
dingy
sheeted
bed
with
the
two
elder
survivors
of
frapp
fecundity
and
spent
my
week
days
in
helping
in
the
laborious
disorder
of
the
shop
and
bakehouse
in
incidental
deliveries
of
bread
and
so
forth
and
in
parrying
the
probings
of
my
uncle
into
my
relations
with
the
blood
and
his
confidential
explanations
that
ten
shillings
a
week
which
was
what
my
mother
paid
him
was
not
enough
to
cover
my
accommodation
he
was
very
anxious
to
keep
that
but
also
he
wanted
more
there
were
neither
books
nor
any
seat
nor
corner
in
that
house
where
reading
was
possible
no
newspaper
ever
brought
the
clash
of
worldly
things
into
its
heavenward
seclusion
horror
of
it
all
grew
in
me
daily
and
whenever
i
could
i
escaped
into
the
streets
and
tramped
about
chatham
the
news
shops
appealed
to
me
particularly
one
saw
there
smudgy
illustrated
sheets
the
police
news
in
particular
in
which
vilely
drawn
pictures
brought
home
to
the
dullest
intelligence
an
interminable
succession
of
squalid
crimes
women
murdered
and
put
into
boxes
buried
under
floors
old
men
bludgeoned
at
midnight
by
robbers
people
thrust
suddenly
out
of
trains
happy
lovers
shot
vitrioled
and
so
forth
by
rivals
i
got
my
first
glimpse
of
the
life
of
pleasure
in
foully
drawn
pictures
of
police
raids
on
this
and
that
interspersed
with
these
sheets
were
others
in
which
sloper
the
urban
john
bull
had
his
fling
with
gin
bottle
and
obese
umbrella
or
the
kindly
empty
faces
of
the
royal
family
appeared
and
reappeared
visiting
this
opening
that
getting
married
getting
offspring
lying
in
state
doing
everything
but
anything
a
wonderful
impenetrable
race
apart
i
have
never
revisited
chatham
the
impression
it
has
left
on
my
mind
is
one
of
squalid
compression
unlit
by
any
gleam
of
a
maturer
charity
all
its
effects
arranged
themselves
as
antithetical
to
the
bladesover
effects
they
confirmed
and
intensified
all
that
bladesover
suggested
bladesover
declared
itself
to
be
the
land
to
be
essentially
england
i
have
already
told
how
its
airy
spaciousness
its
wide
dignity
seemed
to
thrust
village
church
and
vicarage
into
corners
into
a
secondary
and
conditional
significance
here
one
gathered
the
corollary
of
that
since
the
whole
wide
country
of
kent
was
made
up
of
contiguous
bladesovers
and
for
the
gentlefolk
the
surplus
of
population
all
who
were
not
good
tenants
nor
good
labourers
church
of
england
submissive
and
respectful
were
necessarily
thrust
together
jostled
out
of
sight
to
fester
as
they
might
in
this
place
that
had
the
colours
and
even
the
smells
of
a
dustbin
they
should
be
grateful
even
for
that
that
one
felt
was
the
theory
of
it
all
and
i
loafed
about
this
wilderness
of
crowded
dinginess
with
young
receptive
eyes
and
through
the
blessing
or
curse
of
some
fairy
godmother
of
mine
asking
and
asking
again
but
after
all
why
i
wandered
up
through
rochester
once
and
had
a
glimpse
of
the
stour
valley
above
the
town
all
horrible
with
cement
works
and
foully
smoking
chimneys
and
rows
of
workmen
s
cottages
minute
ugly
uncomfortable
and
grimy
so
i
had
my
first
intimation
of
how
industrialism
must
live
in
a
landlord
s
land
i
spent
some
hours
too
in
the
streets
that
give
upon
the
river
drawn
by
the
spell
of
the
sea
but
i
saw
barges
and
ships
stripped
of
magic
and
mostly
devoted
to
cement
ice
timber
and
coal
the
sailors
looked
to
me
gross
and
slovenly
men
and
the
shipping
struck
me
as
clumsy
ugly
old
and
dirty
i
discovered
that
most
sails
don
t
fit
the
ships
that
hoist
them
and
that
there
may
be
as
pitiful
and
squalid
a
display
of
poverty
with
a
vessel
as
with
a
man
when
i
saw
colliers
unloading
watched
the
workers
in
the
hold
filling
up
silly
little
sacks
and
the
succession
of
blackened
men
that
ran
to
and
fro
with
these
along
a
plank
over
a
drop
into
filth
and
mud
i
was
first
seized
with
admiration
of
their
courage
and
toughness
and
then
but
after
all
why
and
the
stupid
ugliness
of
all
this
waste
of
muscle
and
endurance
came
home
to
me
among
other
things
it
obviously
wasted
and
deteriorated
the
coal
and
i
had
imagined
great
things
of
the
sea
well
anyhow
for
a
time
that
vocation
was
stilled
but
such
impressions
came
into
my
leisure
and
of
that
i
had
no
excess
most
of
my
time
was
spent
doing
things
for
uncle
frapp
and
my
evenings
and
nights
perforce
in
the
company
of
the
two
eldest
of
my
cousins
he
was
errand
boy
at
an
oil
shop
and
fervently
pious
and
of
him
i
saw
nothing
until
the
evening
except
at
meals
the
other
was
enjoying
the
midsummer
holidays
without
any
great
elation
a
singularly
thin
and
abject
stunted
creature
he
was
whose
chief
liveliness
was
to
pretend
to
be
a
monkey
and
who
i
am
now
convinced
had
some
secret
disease
that
drained
his
vitality
away
if
i
met
him
now
i
should
think
him
a
pitiful
little
creature
and
be
extremely
sorry
for
him
then
i
felt
only
a
wondering
aversion
he
sniffed
horribly
he
was
tired
out
by
a
couple
of
miles
of
loafing
he
never
started
any
conversation
and
he
seemed
to
prefer
his
own
company
to
mine
his
mother
poor
woman
said
he
was
the
thoughtful
serious
trouble
came
suddenly
out
of
a
conversation
we
held
in
bed
one
night
some
particularly
pious
phrase
of
my
elder
cousin
s
irritated
me
extremely
and
i
avowed
outright
my
entire
disbelief
in
the
whole
scheme
of
revealed
religion
i
had
never
said
a
word
about
my
doubts
to
any
one
before
except
to
ewart
who
had
first
evolved
them
i
had
never
settled
my
doubts
until
at
this
moment
when
i
spoke
but
it
came
to
me
then
that
the
whole
scheme
of
salvation
of
the
frappes
was
not
simply
doubtful
but
impossible
i
fired
this
discovery
out
into
the
darkness
with
the
greatest
promptitude
my
abrupt
denials
certainly
scared
my
cousin
amazingly
at
first
they
could
not
understand
what
i
was
saying
and
when
they
did
i
fully
believe
they
expected
an
instant
answer
in
thunderbolts
and
flames
they
gave
me
more
room
in
the
bed
forthwith
and
then
the
elder
sat
up
and
expressed
his
sense
of
my
awfulness
i
was
already
a
little
frightened
at
my
temerity
but
when
he
asked
me
categorically
to
unsay
what
i
had
said
what
could
i
do
but
confirm
my
repudiation
there
s
no
hell
i
said
and
no
eternal
punishment
no
god
would
be
such
a
fool
as
my
elder
cousin
cried
aloud
in
horror
and
the
younger
lay
scared
but
listening
then
you
mean
said
my
elder
cousin
when
at
last
he
could
bring
himself
to
argue
you
might
do
just
as
you
liked
if
you
were
cad
enough
said
i
our
little
voices
went
on
interminably
and
at
one
stage
my
cousin
got
out
of
bed
and
made
his
brother
do
likewise
and
knelt
in
the
night
dimness
and
prayed
at
me
that
i
found
trying
but
i
held
out
valiantly
forgive
him
said
my
cousin
he
knows
not
what
he
you
can
pray
if
you
like
i
said
but
if
you
re
going
to
cheek
me
in
your
prayers
i
draw
the
the
last
i
remember
of
that
great
discussion
was
my
cousin
deploring
the
fact
that
he
should
ever
sleep
in
the
same
bed
with
an
infidel
the
next
day
he
astonished
me
by
telling
the
whole
business
to
his
father
this
was
quite
outside
all
my
codes
uncle
nicodemus
sprang
it
upon
me
at
the
midday
meal
you
been
sayin
queer
things
george
he
said
abruptly
you
better
mind
what
you
re
what
did
he
say
father
said
frapp
things
i
couldn
t
repeat
said
he
what
things
i
asked
hotly
ask
im
said
my
uncle
pointing
with
his
knife
to
his
informant
and
making
me
realise
the
nature
of
my
offence
my
aunt
looked
at
the
witness
not
she
framed
a
question
wuss
said
my
uncle
my
aunt
couldn
t
touch
another
mouthful
i
was
already
a
little
troubled
in
my
conscience
by
my
daring
and
now
i
began
to
feel
the
black
enormity
of
the
course
upon
which
i
had
embarked
i
was
only
talking
sense
i
said
i
had
a
still
more
dreadful
moment
when
presently
i
met
my
cousin
in
the
brick
alley
behind
the
yard
that
led
back
to
his
grocer
s
shop
you
sneak
i
said
and
smacked
his
face
hard
forthwith
now
then
said
i
he
started
back
astonished
and
alarmed
his
eyes
met
mine
and
i
saw
a
sudden
gleam
of
resolution
he
turned
his
other
cheek
to
me
it
it
he
said
it
it
i
ll
forgive
i
felt
i
had
never
encountered
a
more
detestable
way
of
evading
a
licking
i
shoved
him
against
the
wall
and
left
him
there
forgiving
me
and
went
back
into
the
house
you
better
not
speak
to
your
cousins
george
said
my
aunt
till
you
re
in
a
better
state
of
i
became
an
outcast
forthwith
at
supper
that
night
a
gloomy
silence
was
broken
by
my
cousin
saying
e
it
me
for
telling
you
and
i
turned
the
other
cheek
e
s
got
the
evil
one
be
ind
im
now
a
ridin
on
is
back
said
my
aunt
to
the
grave
discomfort
of
the
eldest
girl
who
sat
beside
me
after
supper
my
uncle
in
a
few
words
prayed
me
to
repent
before
i
slept
suppose
you
was
took
in
your
sleep
george
he
said
where
d
you
be
then
you
jest
think
of
that
me
by
this
time
i
was
thoroughly
miserable
and
frightened
and
this
suggestion
unnerved
me
dreadfully
but
i
kept
up
an
impenitent
front
to
wake
in
ell
said
uncle
nicodemus
in
gentle
tones
you
don
t
want
to
wake
in
ell
george
burnin
and
screamin
for
ever
do
you
you
wouldn
t
like
that
he
tried
very
hard
to
get
me
to
jest
ave
a
look
at
the
bake
ouse
fire
before
i
retired
it
might
move
you
he
said
i
was
awake
longest
that
night
my
cousins
slept
the
sleep
of
faith
on
either
side
of
me
i
decided
i
would
whisper
my
prayers
and
stopped
midway
because
i
was
ashamed
and
perhaps
also
because
i
had
an
idea
one
didn
t
square
god
like
that
no
i
said
with
a
sudden
confidence
damn
me
if
you
re
coward
enough
but
you
re
not
no
you
couldn
t
be
i
woke
my
cousins
up
with
emphatic
digs
and
told
them
as
much
triumphantly
and
went
very
peacefully
to
sleep
with
my
act
of
faith
accomplished
i
slept
not
only
through
that
night
but
for
all
my
nights
since
then
so
far
as
any
fear
of
divine
injustice
goes
i
sleep
soundly
and
shall
i
know
to
the
end
of
things
that
declaration
was
an
epoch
in
my
spiritual
life
ii
but
i
didn
t
expect
to
have
the
whole
meeting
on
sunday
turned
on
to
me
it
was
it
all
comes
back
to
me
that
convergence
of
attention
even
the
faint
leathery
smell
of
its
atmosphere
returns
and
the
coarse
feel
of
my
aunt
s
black
dress
beside
me
in
contact
with
my
hand
i
see
again
the
old
welsh
milkman
wrestling
with
me
they
all
wrestled
with
me
by
prayer
or
exhortation
and
i
was
holding
out
stoutly
though
convinced
now
by
the
contagion
of
their
universal
conviction
that
by
doing
so
i
was
certainly
and
hopelessly
damned
i
felt
that
they
were
right
that
god
was
probably
like
them
and
that
on
the
whole
it
didn
t
matter
and
to
simplify
the
business
thoroughly
i
had
declared
i
didn
t
believe
anything
at
all
they
confuted
me
by
texts
from
scripture
which
i
now
perceive
was
an
illegitimate
method
of
reply
when
i
got
home
still
impenitent
and
eternally
lost
and
secretly
very
lonely
and
miserable
and
alarmed
uncle
nicodemus
docked
my
sunday
pudding
one
person
only
spoke
to
me
like
a
human
being
on
that
day
of
wrath
and
that
was
the
younger
frapp
he
came
up
to
me
in
the
afternoon
while
i
was
confined
upstairs
with
a
bible
and
my
own
thoughts
ello
he
said
and
fretted
about
d
you
mean
to
say
there
isn
t
no
one
he
said
funking
the
word
no
one
no
one
watching
yer
why
should
there
be
i
asked
you
can
t
elp
thoughts
said
my
cousin
anyhow
you
mean
he
stopped
hovering
i
s
pose
i
oughtn
t
to
be
talking
to
he
hesitated
and
flitted
away
with
a
guilty
back
glance
over
his
shoulder
the
following
week
made
life
quite
intolerable
for
me
these
people
forced
me
at
last
into
an
atheism
that
terrified
me
when
i
learnt
that
next
sunday
the
wrestling
was
to
be
resumed
my
courage
failed
me
altogether
i
happened
upon
a
map
of
kent
in
a
stationer
s
window
on
saturday
and
that
set
me
thinking
of
one
form
of
release
i
studied
it
intently
for
half
an
hour
perhaps
on
saturday
night
got
a
route
list
of
villages
well
fixed
in
my
memory
and
got
up
and
started
for
bladesover
about
five
on
sunday
morning
while
my
two
bed
mates
were
still
fast
asleep
iii
i
remember
something
but
not
so
much
of
it
as
i
should
like
to
recall
of
my
long
tramp
to
bladesover
house
the
distance
from
chatham
is
almost
exactly
seventeen
miles
and
it
took
me
until
nearly
one
it
was
very
interesting
and
i
do
not
think
i
was
very
fatigued
though
i
got
rather
pinched
by
one
boot
the
morning
must
have
been
very
clear
because
i
remember
that
near
itchinstow
hall
i
looked
back
and
saw
the
estuary
of
the
thames
that
river
that
has
since
played
so
large
a
part
in
my
life
but
at
the
time
i
did
not
know
it
was
the
thames
i
thought
this
great
expanse
of
mud
flats
and
water
was
the
sea
which
i
had
never
yet
seen
nearly
and
out
upon
it
stood
ships
sailing
ships
and
a
steamer
or
so
going
up
to
london
or
down
out
into
the
great
seas
of
the
world
i
stood
for
a
long
time
watching
these
and
thinking
whether
after
all
i
should
not
have
done
better
to
have
run
away
to
sea
the
nearer
i
drew
to
bladesover
the
more
doubtful
i
grew
of
the
duality
of
my
reception
and
the
more
i
regretted
that
alternative
i
suppose
it
was
the
dirty
clumsiness
of
the
shipping
i
had
seen
nearly
that
put
me
out
of
mind
of
that
i
took
a
short
cut
through
the
warren
across
the
corner
of
the
main
park
to
intercept
the
people
from
the
church
i
wanted
to
avoid
meeting
any
one
before
i
met
my
mother
and
so
i
went
to
a
place
where
the
path
passed
between
banks
and
without
exactly
hiding
stood
up
among
the
bushes
this
place
among
other
advantages
eliminated
any
chance
of
seeing
lady
drew
who
would
drive
round
by
the
carriage
road
standing
up
to
waylay
in
this
fashion
i
had
a
queer
feeling
of
brigandage
as
though
i
was
some
intrusive
sort
of
bandit
among
these
orderly
things
it
is
the
first
time
i
remember
having
that
outlaw
feeling
distinctly
a
feeling
that
has
played
a
large
part
in
my
subsequent
life
i
felt
there
existed
no
place
for
me
that
i
had
to
drive
myself
in
presently
down
the
hill
the
servants
appeared
straggling
by
twos
and
threes
first
some
of
the
garden
people
and
the
butler
s
wife
with
them
then
the
two
laundry
maids
odd
inseparable
old
creatures
then
the
first
footman
talking
to
the
butler
s
little
girl
and
at
last
walking
grave
and
breathless
beside
old
ann
and
miss
fison
the
black
figure
of
my
mother
my
boyish
mind
suggested
the
adoption
of
a
playful
form
of
appearance
mother
said
i
coming
out
against
the
sky
my
mother
looked
up
went
very
white
and
put
her
hand
to
her
bosom
i
suppose
there
was
a
fearful
fuss
about
me
and
of
course
i
was
quite
unable
to
explain
my
reappearance
but
i
held
out
stoutly
i
won
t
go
back
to
chatham
i
ll
drown
myself
the
next
day
my
mother
carried
me
off
to
wimblehurst
took
me
fiercely
and
aggressively
to
an
uncle
i
had
never
heard
of
before
near
though
the
place
was
to
us
she
gave
me
no
word
as
to
what
was
to
happen
and
i
was
too
subdued
by
her
manifest
wrath
and
humiliation
at
my
last
misdemeanour
to
demand
information
i
don
t
for
one
moment
think
lady
drew
was
nice
about
me
the
finality
of
my
banishment
was
endorsed
and
underlined
and
stamped
home
i
wished
very
much
now
that
i
had
run
away
to
sea
in
spite
of
the
coal
dust
and
squalour
rochester
had
revealed
to
me
perhaps
over
seas
one
came
to
different
lands
iv
i
do
not
remember
much
of
my
journey
to
wimblehurst
with
my
mother
except
the
image
of
her
as
sitting
bolt
upright
as
rather
disdaining
the
carriage
in
which
we
traveled
and
how
she
looked
away
from
me
out
of
the
window
when
she
spoke
of
my
uncle
i
have
not
seen
your
uncle
she
said
since
he
was
a
boy
she
added
grudgingly
then
he
was
supposed
to
be
she
took
little
interest
in
such
qualities
as
cleverness
he
married
about
three
years
ago
and
set
up
for
himself
in
wimblehurst
so
i
suppose
she
had
some
she
mused
on
scenes
she
had
long
dismissed
from
her
mind
teddy
she
said
at
last
in
the
tone
of
one
who
has
been
feeling
in
the
dark
and
finds
he
was
called
teddy
about
your
age
now
he
must
be
or
i
thought
of
my
uncle
as
teddy
directly
i
saw
him
there
was
something
in
his
personal
appearance
that
in
the
light
of
that
memory
phrased
itself
at
once
as
teddiness
a
certain
teddidity
to
describe
it
in
and
other
terms
is
more
difficult
it
is
nimbleness
without
grace
and
alertness
without
intelligence
he
whisked
out
of
his
shop
upon
the
pavement
a
short
figure
in
grey
and
wearing
grey
carpet
slippers
one
had
a
sense
of
a
young
fattish
face
behind
gilt
glasses
wiry
hair
that
stuck
up
and
forward
over
the
forehead
an
irregular
nose
that
had
its
aquiline
moments
and
that
the
body
betrayed
an
equatorial
laxity
an
incipient
bow
window
as
the
image
goes
he
jerked
out
of
the
shop
came
to
a
stand
on
the
pavement
outside
regarded
something
in
the
window
with
infinite
appreciation
stroked
his
chin
and
as
abruptly
shot
sideways
into
the
door
again
charging
through
it
as
it
were
behind
an
extended
hand
that
must
be
him
said
my
mother
catching
at
her
breath
we
came
past
the
window
whose
contents
i
was
presently
to
know
by
heart
a
very
ordinary
chemist
s
window
except
that
there
was
a
frictional
electrical
machine
an
air
pump
and
two
or
three
tripods
and
retorts
replacing
the
customary
blue
yellow
and
red
bottles
above
there
was
a
plaster
of
paris
horse
to
indicate
veterinary
medicines
among
these
breakables
and
below
were
scent
packets
and
diffusers
and
sponges
and
syphons
and
things
only
in
the
middle
there
was
a
rubricated
card
very
neatly
painted
by
hand
with
these
words
buy
ponderevo
s
cough
linctus
now
now
why
twopence
cheaper
than
in
winter
you
store
apples
why
not
the
medicine
you
are
bound
to
need
in
which
appeal
i
was
to
recognise
presently
my
uncle
s
distinctive
note
my
uncle
s
face
appeared
above
a
card
of
infant
s
comforters
in
the
glass
pane
of
the
door
i
perceived
his
eyes
were
brown
and
that
his
glasses
creased
his
nose
it
was
manifest
he
did
not
know
us
from
adam
a
stare
of
scrutiny
allowed
an
expression
of
commercial
deference
to
appear
in
front
of
it
and
my
uncle
flung
open
the
door
you
don
t
know
me
panted
my
mother
my
uncle
would
not
own
he
did
not
but
his
curiosity
was
manifest
my
mother
sat
down
on
one
of
the
little
chairs
before
the
soap
and
patent
counter
and
her
lips
opened
and
closed
a
glass
of
water
madam
said
my
uncle
waved
his
hand
in
a
sort
of
curve
and
shot
away
my
mother
drank
the
water
and
spoke
that
boy
she
said
takes
after
his
father
he
grows
more
like
him
every
day
and
so
i
have
brought
him
to
his
father
madam
for
a
moment
the
chemist
was
still
at
a
loss
he
stood
behind
the
counter
with
the
glass
my
mother
had
returned
to
him
in
his
hand
then
comprehension
grew
by
gosh
he
said
lord
he
cried
his
glasses
fell
off
he
disappeared
replacing
them
behind
a
pile
of
bottles
of
blood
mixture
eleven
thousand
virgins
i
heard
him
cry
the
glass
was
banged
down
gums
he
shot
away
out
of
the
shop
through
some
masked
door
one
heard
his
voice
susan
susan
then
he
reappeared
with
an
extended
hand
well
how
are
you
he
said
i
was
never
so
surprised
in
my
life
fancy
you
he
shook
my
mother
s
impassive
hand
and
then
mine
very
warmly
holding
his
glasses
on
with
his
left
forefinger
come
right
in
he
cried
come
right
in
better
late
than
never
and
led
the
way
into
the
parlour
behind
the
shop
after
bladesover
that
apartment
struck
me
as
stuffy
and
petty
but
it
was
very
comfortable
in
comparison
with
the
frapp
it
had
a
faint
disintegrating
smell
of
meals
about
it
and
my
most
immediate
impression
was
of
the
remarkable
fact
that
something
was
hung
about
or
wrapped
round
or
draped
over
everything
there
was
muslin
round
the
in
the
middle
of
the
room
round
the
mirror
over
the
mantel
stuff
with
along
the
mantel
and
casing
in
the
fireplace
i
first
saw
here
and
even
the
lamp
on
the
little
bureau
wore
a
shade
like
a
large
muslin
hat
the
had
and
so
had
the
window
curtains
and
the
carpet
was
a
bed
of
roses
there
were
little
cupboards
on
either
side
of
the
fireplace
and
in
the
recesses
shelves
packed
with
books
and
enriched
with
pinked
american
cloth
there
was
a
dictionary
lying
face
downward
on
the
table
and
the
open
bureau
was
littered
with
foolscap
paper
and
the
evidences
of
recently
abandoned
toil
my
eye
caught
the
ponderevo
patent
flat
a
machine
you
can
live
in
written
in
large
firm
letters
my
uncle
opened
a
little
door
like
a
cupboard
door
in
the
corner
of
this
room
and
revealed
the
narrowest
twist
of
staircase
i
had
ever
set
eyes
upon
susan
he
bawled
again
wantje
some
one
to
see
you
surprisin
there
came
an
inaudible
reply
and
a
sudden
loud
bump
over
our
heads
as
of
some
article
of
domestic
utility
pettishly
flung
aside
then
the
cautious
steps
of
someone
descending
the
twist
and
then
my
aunt
appeared
in
the
doorway
with
her
hand
upon
the
jamb
it
s
aunt
ponderevo
cried
my
uncle
george
s
wife
and
she
s
brought
over
her
son
his
eye
roamed
about
the
room
he
darted
to
the
bureau
with
a
sudden
impulse
and
turned
the
sheet
about
the
patent
flat
face
down
then
he
waved
his
glasses
at
us
you
know
susan
my
elder
brother
george
i
told
you
about
im
lots
of
he
fretted
across
to
the
hearthrug
and
took
up
a
position
there
replaced
his
glasses
and
coughed
my
aunt
susan
seemed
to
be
taking
it
in
she
was
then
rather
a
pretty
slender
woman
of
or
four
i
suppose
and
i
remember
being
struck
by
the
blueness
of
her
eyes
and
the
clear
freshness
of
her
complexion
she
had
little
features
a
button
nose
a
pretty
chin
and
a
long
graceful
neck
that
stuck
out
of
her
pale
blue
cotton
morning
dress
there
was
a
look
of
perplexity
on
her
face
a
little
quizzical
wrinkle
of
the
brow
that
suggested
a
faintly
amused
attempt
to
follow
my
uncle
s
mental
operations
a
vain
attempt
and
a
certain
hopelessness
that
had
in
succession
become
habitual
she
seemed
to
be
saying
oh
lord
what
s
he
giving
me
this
time
and
as
came
to
know
her
better
i
detected
as
a
complication
of
her
effort
of
apprehension
a
subsidiary
riddle
to
what
s
he
giving
me
and
that
was
to
borrow
a
phrase
from
my
schoolboy
language
is
it
keeps
she
looked
at
my
mother
and
me
and
back
to
her
husband
again
you
know
he
said
well
she
said
to
my
mother
descending
the
last
three
steps
of
the
staircase
and
holding
out
her
hand
you
re
welcome
though
it
s
a
surprise
i
can
t
ask
you
to
have
anything
i
m
afraid
for
there
isn
t
anything
in
the
she
smiled
and
looked
at
her
husband
banteringly
unless
he
makes
up
something
with
his
old
chemicals
which
he
s
quite
equal
to
my
mother
shook
hands
stiffly
and
told
me
to
kiss
my
aunt
well
let
s
all
sit
down
said
my
uncle
suddenly
whistling
through
his
clenched
teeth
and
briskly
rubbing
his
hands
together
he
put
up
a
chair
for
my
mother
raised
the
blind
of
the
little
window
lowered
it
again
and
returned
to
his
hearthrug
i
m
sure
he
said
as
one
who
decides
i
m
very
glad
to
see
v
as
they
talked
i
gave
my
attention
pretty
exclusively
to
my
uncle
i
noted
him
in
great
detail
i
remember
now
his
partially
unbuttoned
waistcoat
as
though
something
had
occurred
to
distract
him
as
he
did
it
up
and
a
little
cut
upon
his
chin
i
liked
a
certain
humour
in
his
eyes
i
watched
too
with
the
fascination
that
things
have
for
an
observant
boy
the
play
of
his
lips
they
were
a
little
oblique
and
there
was
something
slipshod
if
one
may
strain
a
word
so
far
about
his
mouth
so
that
he
lisped
and
sibilated
ever
and
again
and
the
coming
and
going
of
a
curious
expression
triumphant
in
quality
it
was
upon
his
face
as
he
talked
he
fingered
his
glasses
which
did
not
seem
to
fit
his
nose
fretted
with
things
in
his
waistcoat
pockets
or
put
his
hands
behind
him
looked
over
our
heads
and
ever
and
again
rose
to
his
toes
and
dropped
back
on
his
heels
he
had
a
way
of
drawing
air
in
at
times
through
his
teeth
that
gave
a
whispering
zest
to
his
speech
it
s
a
sound
i
can
only
represent
as
a
soft
zzzz
he
did
most
of
the
talking
my
mother
repeated
what
she
had
already
said
in
the
shop
i
have
brought
george
over
to
you
and
then
desisted
for
a
time
from
the
real
business
in
hand
you
find
this
a
comfortable
house
she
asked
and
this
being
affirmed
it
looks
very
convenient
not
too
big
to
be
a
trouble
no
you
like
wimblehurst
i
suppose
my
uncle
retorted
with
some
inquiries
about
the
great
people
of
bladesover
and
my
mother
answered
in
the
character
of
a
personal
friend
of
lady
drew
s
the
talk
hung
for
a
time
and
then
my
uncle
embarked
upon
a
dissertation
upon
wimblehurst
this
place
he
began
isn
t
of
course
quite
the
place
i
ought
to
be
my
mother
nodded
as
though
she
had
expected
that
it
gives
me
no
scope
he
went
on
it
s
nothing
he
s
always
wanting
something
to
happen
said
my
aunt
susan
some
day
he
ll
get
a
shower
of
things
and
they
ll
be
too
much
for
not
they
said
my
uncle
buoyantly
do
you
find
business
slack
asked
my
mother
oh
one
rubs
along
but
there
s
no
development
no
growth
they
just
come
along
here
and
buy
pills
when
they
want
em
and
a
horseball
or
such
they
ve
got
to
be
ill
before
there
s
a
prescription
that
sort
they
are
you
can
t
get
em
to
launch
out
you
can
t
get
em
to
take
up
anything
new
for
instance
i
ve
been
trying
lately
induce
them
to
buy
their
medicines
in
advance
and
in
larger
quantities
but
they
won
t
look
for
it
then
i
tried
to
float
a
little
notion
of
mine
sort
of
an
insurance
scheme
for
colds
you
pay
so
much
a
week
and
when
you
ve
got
a
cold
you
get
a
bottle
of
cough
linctus
so
long
as
you
can
produce
a
substantial
sniff
see
but
lord
they
ve
no
capacity
for
ideas
they
don
t
catch
on
no
jump
about
the
place
no
life
live
they
trickle
and
what
one
has
to
do
here
is
to
trickle
too
ah
said
my
mother
it
doesn
t
suit
me
said
my
uncle
i
m
the
cascading
george
was
that
said
my
mother
after
a
pondering
moment
my
aunt
susan
took
up
the
parable
with
an
affectionate
glance
at
her
husband
he
s
always
trying
to
make
his
old
business
jump
she
said
always
putting
fresh
cards
in
the
window
or
getting
up
to
something
you
d
hardly
believe
it
makes
me
jump
but
it
does
no
good
said
my
uncle
it
does
no
good
said
his
wife
it
s
not
his
miloo
presently
they
came
upon
a
wide
pause
from
the
beginning
of
their
conversation
there
had
been
the
promise
of
this
pause
and
i
pricked
my
ears
i
knew
perfectly
what
was
bound
to
come
they
were
going
to
talk
of
my
father
i
was
enormously
strengthened
in
my
persuasion
when
i
found
my
mother
s
eyes
resting
thoughtfully
upon
me
in
the
silence
and
than
my
uncle
looked
at
me
and
then
my
aunt
i
struggled
unavailingly
to
produce
an
expression
of
meek
stupidity
i
think
said
my
uncle
that
george
will
find
it
more
amusing
to
have
a
turn
in
the
than
to
sit
here
talking
with
us
there
s
a
pair
of
stocks
there
george
very
interesting
i
don
t
mind
sitting
here
i
said
my
uncle
rose
and
in
the
most
friendly
way
led
me
through
the
shop
he
stood
on
his
doorstep
and
jerked
amiable
directions
to
me
ain
t
it
sleepy
george
eh
there
s
the
butcher
s
dog
over
there
asleep
in
the
an
hour
from
midday
if
the
last
trump
sounded
i
don
t
believe
it
would
wake
nobody
would
wake
the
chaps
up
there
in
the
churchyard
they
d
just
turn
over
and
say
naar
you
don
t
catch
us
you
don
t
see
well
you
ll
find
the
stocks
just
round
that
he
watched
me
out
of
sight
so
i
never
heard
what
they
said
about
my
father
after
all
vi
when
i
returned
my
uncle
had
in
some
remarkable
way
become
larger
and
central
tha
chu
george
he
cried
when
the
bell
sounded
come
right
through
and
i
found
him
as
it
were
in
the
chairman
s
place
before
the
draped
grate
the
three
of
them
regarded
me
we
have
been
talking
of
making
you
a
chemist
george
said
my
uncle
my
mother
looked
at
me
i
had
hoped
she
said
that
lady
drew
would
have
done
something
for
him
she
stopped
in
what
way
said
my
uncle
she
might
have
spoken
to
some
one
got
him
into
something
perhaps
she
had
the
servant
s
invincible
persuasion
that
all
good
things
are
done
by
patronage
he
is
not
the
sort
of
boy
for
whom
things
are
done
she
added
dismissing
these
dreams
he
doesn
t
accommodate
himself
when
he
thinks
lady
drew
wishes
a
thing
he
seems
not
to
wish
it
towards
redgrave
too
he
has
been
disrespectful
he
is
like
his
who
s
redgrave
the
a
bit
independent
said
my
uncle
briskly
disobedient
said
my
mother
he
has
no
idea
of
his
place
he
seems
to
think
he
can
get
on
by
slighting
people
and
flouting
them
he
ll
learn
perhaps
before
it
is
too
my
uncle
stroked
his
cut
chin
and
me
have
you
learnt
any
latin
he
asked
abruptly
i
said
i
had
not
he
ll
have
to
learn
a
little
latin
he
explained
to
my
mother
to
qualify
h
m
he
could
go
down
to
the
chap
at
the
grammar
school
here
it
s
just
been
routed
into
existence
again
by
the
charity
commissioners
and
have
what
me
learn
latin
i
cried
with
emotion
a
little
he
said
i
ve
always
wanted
i
said
and
latin
i
had
long
been
obsessed
by
the
idea
that
having
no
latin
was
a
disadvantage
in
the
world
and
archie
garvell
had
driven
the
point
of
this
pretty
earnestly
home
the
literature
i
had
read
at
bladesover
had
all
tended
that
way
latin
had
had
a
quality
of
emancipation
for
me
that
i
find
it
difficult
to
convey
and
suddenly
when
i
had
supposed
all
learning
was
at
an
end
for
me
i
heard
this
it
s
no
good
to
you
of
course
said
my
uncle
except
to
pass
exams
with
but
there
you
are
you
ll
have
to
learn
latin
because
you
have
to
learn
latin
said
my
mother
not
because
you
want
to
and
afterwards
you
will
have
to
learn
all
sorts
of
other
things
the
idea
that
i
was
to
go
on
learning
that
to
read
and
master
the
contents
of
books
was
still
to
be
justifiable
as
a
duty
overwhelmed
all
other
facts
i
had
had
it
rather
clear
in
my
mind
for
some
weeks
that
all
that
kind
of
opportunity
might
close
to
me
for
ever
i
began
to
take
a
lively
interest
in
this
new
project
then
shall
i
live
here
i
asked
with
you
and
study
as
well
as
work
in
the
shop
that
s
the
way
of
it
said
my
uncle
i
parted
from
my
mother
that
day
in
a
dream
so
sudden
and
important
was
this
new
aspect
of
things
to
me
i
was
to
learn
latin
now
that
the
humiliation
of
my
failure
at
bladesover
was
past
for
her
now
that
she
had
a
little
got
over
her
first
intense
repugnance
at
this
resort
to
my
uncle
and
contrived
something
that
seemed
like
a
possible
provision
for
my
future
the
tenderness
natural
to
a
parting
far
more
significant
than
any
of
our
previous
partings
crept
into
her
manner
she
sat
in
the
train
to
return
i
remember
and
i
stood
at
the
open
door
of
her
compartment
and
neither
of
us
knew
how
soon
we
should
cease
for
ever
to
be
a
trouble
to
one
another
you
must
be
a
good
boy
george
she
said
you
must
learn
and
you
mustn
t
set
yourself
up
against
those
who
are
above
you
and
better
than
you
or
envy
no
mother
i
said
i
promised
carelessly
her
eyes
were
fixed
upon
me
i
was
wondering
whether
i
could
by
any
means
begin
latin
that
night
something
touched
her
heart
then
some
thought
some
memory
perhaps
some
premonition
the
solitary
porter
began
slamming
carriage
doors
george
she
said
hastily
almost
shamefully
kiss
me
i
stepped
up
into
her
compartment
as
she
bent
downward
she
caught
me
in
her
arms
quite
eagerly
she
pressed
me
to
her
a
strange
thing
for
her
to
do
i
perceived
her
eyes
were
extraordinarily
bright
and
then
this
brightness
burst
along
the
lower
lids
and
rolled
down
her
cheeks
for
the
first
and
last
time
in
my
life
i
saw
my
mother
s
tears
then
she
had
gone
leaving
me
discomforted
and
perplexed
forgetting
for
a
time
even
that
i
was
to
learn
latin
thinking
of
my
mother
as
of
something
new
and
strange
the
thing
recurred
though
i
sought
to
dismiss
it
it
stuck
itself
into
my
memory
against
the
day
of
fuller
understanding
poor
proud
habitual
sternly
narrow
soul
poor
difficult
and
misunderstanding
son
it
was
the
first
time
that
ever
it
dawned
upon
me
that
my
mother
also
might
perhaps
feel
vii
my
mother
died
suddenly
and
it
was
thought
by
lady
drew
inconsiderately
the
following
spring
her
ladyship
instantly
fled
to
folkestone
with
miss
somerville
and
fison
until
the
funeral
should
be
over
and
my
mother
s
successor
installed
my
uncle
took
me
over
to
the
funeral
i
remember
there
was
a
sort
of
prolonged
crisis
in
the
days
preceding
this
because
directly
he
heard
of
my
loss
he
had
sent
a
pair
of
check
trousers
to
the
judkins
people
in
london
to
be
dyed
black
and
they
did
not
come
back
in
time
he
became
very
excited
on
the
third
day
and
sent
a
number
of
increasingly
fiery
telegrams
without
any
result
whatever
and
succumbed
next
morning
with
a
very
ill
grace
to
my
aunt
susan
s
insistence
upon
the
resources
of
his
in
my
memory
those
black
legs
of
his
in
a
particularly
thin
and
shiny
black
cloth
for
evidently
his
dated
from
adolescent
and
slenderer
days
straddle
like
the
colossus
of
rhodes
over
my
approach
to
my
mother
s
funeral
moreover
i
was
inconvenienced
and
distracted
by
a
silk
hat
he
had
bought
me
my
first
silk
hat
much
ennobled
as
his
was
also
by
a
deep
mourning
band
i
remember
but
rather
indistinctly
my
mother
s
white
paneled
housekeeper
s
room
and
the
touch
of
oddness
about
it
that
she
was
not
there
and
the
various
familiar
faces
made
strange
by
black
and
i
seem
to
recall
the
exaggerated
that
arose
out
of
their
focussed
attention
no
doubt
the
sense
of
the
new
silk
hat
came
and
went
and
came
again
in
my
emotional
chaos
then
something
comes
out
clear
and
sorrowful
rises
out
clear
and
sheer
from
among
all
these
rather
base
and
inconsequent
things
and
once
again
i
walk
before
all
the
other
mourners
close
behind
her
coffin
as
it
is
carried
along
the
churchyard
path
to
her
grave
with
the
old
vicar
s
slow
voice
saying
regretfully
and
unconvincingly
above
me
triumphant
solemn
things
i
am
the
resurrection
and
the
life
saith
the
lord
he
that
believeth
in
me
though
he
were
dead
yet
shall
he
live
and
whosoever
liveth
and
believeth
in
me
shall
never
never
die
the
day
was
a
high
and
glorious
morning
in
spring
and
all
the
trees
were
budding
and
bursting
into
green
everywhere
there
were
blossoms
and
flowers
the
pear
trees
and
cherry
trees
in
the
sexton
s
garden
were
sunlit
snow
there
were
nodding
daffodils
and
early
tulips
in
the
graveyard
beds
great
multitudes
of
daisies
and
everywhere
the
birds
seemed
singing
and
in
the
middle
was
the
brown
coffin
end
tilting
on
men
s
shoulders
and
half
occluded
by
the
vicar
s
oxford
hood
and
so
we
came
to
my
mother
s
waiting
grave
for
a
time
i
was
very
observant
watching
the
coffin
lowered
hearing
the
words
of
the
ritual
it
seemed
a
very
curious
business
altogether
suddenly
as
the
service
drew
to
its
end
i
felt
something
had
still
to
be
said
which
had
not
been
said
realised
that
she
had
withdrawn
in
silence
neither
forgiving
me
nor
hearing
from
me
those
now
lost
assurances
suddenly
i
knew
i
had
not
understood
suddenly
i
saw
her
tenderly
remembered
not
so
much
tender
or
kindly
things
of
her
as
her
crossed
wishes
and
the
ways
in
which
i
had
thwarted
her
surprisingly
i
realised
that
behind
all
her
hardness
and
severity
she
had
loved
me
that
i
was
the
only
thing
she
had
ever
loved
and
that
until
this
moment
i
had
never
loved
her
and
now
she
was
there
and
deaf
and
blind
to
me
pitifully
defeated
in
her
designs
for
me
covered
from
me
so
that
she
could
not
know
i
dug
my
nails
into
the
palms
of
my
hands
i
set
my
teeth
but
tears
blinded
me
sobs
would
have
choked
me
had
speech
been
required
of
me
the
old
vicar
read
on
there
came
a
mumbled
response
and
so
on
to
the
end
i
wept
as
it
were
internally
and
only
when
we
had
come
out
of
the
churchyard
could
i
think
and
speak
calmly
again
stamped
across
this
memory
are
the
little
black
figures
of
my
uncle
and
rabbits
telling
avebury
the
sexton
and
undertaker
that
it
had
all
passed
off
very
well
very
well
viii
that
is
the
last
i
shall
tell
of
bladesover
the
dropscene
falls
on
that
and
it
comes
no
more
as
an
actual
presence
into
this
novel
i
did
indeed
go
back
there
once
again
but
under
circumstances
quite
immaterial
to
my
story
but
in
a
sense
bladesover
has
never
left
me
it
is
as
i
said
at
the
outset
one
of
those
dominant
explanatory
impressions
that
make
the
framework
of
my
mind
bladesover
illuminates
england
it
has
become
all
that
is
spacious
dignified
pretentious
and
truly
conservative
in
english
life
it
is
my
social
datum
that
is
why
i
have
drawn
it
here
on
so
large
a
scale
when
i
came
back
at
last
to
the
real
bladesover
on
an
inconsequent
visit
everything
was
far
smaller
than
i
could
have
supposed
possible
it
was
as
though
everything
had
shivered
and
shrivelled
a
little
at
the
lichtenstein
touch
the
harp
was
still
in
the
saloon
but
there
was
a
different
grand
piano
with
a
painted
lid
and
a
metrostyle
pianola
and
an
extraordinary
quantity
of
artistic
litter
and
scattered
about
there
was
the
trail
of
the
bond
street
showroom
over
it
all
the
furniture
was
still
under
chintz
but
it
wasn
t
the
same
sort
of
chintz
although
it
pretended
to
be
and
the
chandeliers
had
passed
away
lady
lichtenstein
s
books
replaced
the
brown
volumes
i
had
browsed
among
they
were
mostly
presentation
copies
of
contemporary
novels
and
the
national
review
and
the
empire
review
and
the
nineteenth
century
and
after
jostled
current
books
on
the
tables
english
new
books
in
gaudy
catchpenny
artistic
covers
french
and
italian
novels
in
yellow
german
art
handbooks
of
almost
incredible
ugliness
there
were
abundant
evidences
that
her
ladyship
was
playing
with
the
keltic
renascence
and
a
great
number
of
ugly
cats
made
of
china
she
collected
china
and
stoneware
cats
stood
about
everywhere
in
all
colours
in
all
kinds
of
deliberately
comic
highly
glazed
distortion
it
is
nonsense
to
pretend
that
finance
makes
any
better
aristocrats
than
rent
nothing
can
make
an
aristocrat
but
pride
knowledge
training
and
the
sword
these
people
were
no
improvement
on
the
drews
none
whatever
there
was
no
effect
of
a
beneficial
replacement
of
passive
unintelligent
people
by
active
intelligent
ones
one
felt
that
a
smaller
but
more
enterprising
and
intensely
undignified
variety
of
stupidity
had
replaced
the
large
dullness
of
the
old
gentry
and
that
was
all
bladesover
i
thought
had
undergone
just
the
same
change
between
the
seventies
and
the
new
century
that
had
overtaken
the
dear
old
times
and
heaven
knows
how
much
more
of
the
decorous
british
fabric
these
lichtensteins
and
their
like
seem
to
have
no
promise
in
them
at
all
of
any
fresh
vitality
for
the
kingdom
i
do
not
believe
in
their
intelligence
or
their
power
they
have
nothing
new
about
them
at
all
nothing
creative
nor
rejuvenescent
no
more
than
a
disorderly
instinct
of
acquisition
and
the
prevalence
of
them
and
their
kind
is
but
a
phase
in
the
broad
slow
decay
of
the
great
social
organism
of
england
they
could
not
have
made
bladesover
they
can
not
replace
it
they
just
happen
to
break
out
over
it
saprophytically
well
that
was
my
last
impression
of
bladesover
chapter
the
third
the
wimblehurst
apprenticeship
i
so
far
as
i
can
remember
now
except
for
that
one
emotional
phase
by
the
graveside
i
passed
through
all
these
experiences
rather
callously
i
had
already
with
the
facility
of
youth
changed
my
world
ceased
to
think
at
all
of
the
old
school
routine
and
put
bladesover
aside
for
digestion
at
a
latter
stage
i
took
up
my
new
world
in
wimblehurst
with
the
chemist
s
shop
as
its
hub
set
to
work
at
latin
and
materia
medica
and
concentrated
upon
the
present
with
all
my
heart
wimblehurst
is
an
exceptionally
quiet
and
grey
sussex
town
rare
among
south
of
england
towns
in
being
largely
built
of
stone
i
found
something
very
agreeable
and
picturesque
in
its
clean
cobbled
streets
its
odd
turnings
and
abrupt
corners
and
in
the
pleasant
park
that
crowds
up
one
side
of
the
town
the
whole
place
is
under
the
eastry
dominion
and
it
was
the
eastry
influence
and
dignity
that
kept
its
railway
station
a
mile
and
away
eastry
house
is
so
close
that
it
dominates
the
whole
one
goes
across
the
marketplace
with
its
old
and
stocks
past
the
great
church
a
fine
grey
shell
like
some
empty
skull
from
which
the
life
has
fled
and
there
at
once
are
the
huge
gates
and
one
peeps
through
them
to
see
the
facade
of
this
place
very
white
and
large
and
fine
down
a
long
avenue
of
yews
eastry
was
far
greater
than
bladesover
and
an
altogether
completer
example
of
the
eighteenth
century
system
it
ruled
not
two
villages
but
a
borough
that
had
sent
its
sons
and
cousins
to
parliament
almost
as
a
matter
of
right
so
long
as
its
franchise
endured
every
one
was
in
the
system
every
one
except
my
uncle
he
stood
out
and
complained
my
uncle
was
the
first
real
breach
i
found
in
the
great
front
of
bladesover
the
world
had
presented
me
for
chatham
was
not
so
much
a
breach
as
a
confirmation
but
my
uncle
had
no
respect
for
bladesover
and
eastry
none
whatever
he
did
not
believe
in
them
he
was
blind
even
to
what
they
were
he
propounded
strange
phrases
about
them
he
exfoliated
and
wagged
about
novel
and
incredible
ideas
this
place
said
my
uncle
surveying
it
from
his
open
doorway
in
the
dignified
stillness
of
a
summer
afternoon
wants
waking
up
i
was
sorting
up
patent
medicines
in
the
corner
i
d
like
to
let
a
dozen
young
americans
loose
into
it
said
my
uncle
then
we
d
i
made
a
tick
against
mother
shipton
s
sleeping
syrup
we
had
cleared
our
forward
stock
things
must
be
happening
somewhere
george
he
broke
out
in
a
querulously
rising
note
as
he
came
back
into
the
little
shop
he
fiddled
with
the
piled
dummy
boxes
of
fancy
soap
and
scent
and
so
forth
that
adorned
the
end
of
the
counter
then
turned
about
petulantly
stuck
his
hands
deeply
into
his
pockets
and
withdrew
one
to
scratch
his
head
i
must
do
something
he
said
i
can
t
stand
it
i
must
invent
something
and
shove
it
i
could
or
a
play

a
deal
of
money

a
play

of
things

or

he
fell
into
that
meditative
whistling
of
his
wine
he
swore
this
isn
t

world
it
s
cold
mutton
fat
that
s
what
wimblehurst
is
cold
mutton
fat
dead
and
stiff
and
i

buried
in
it

while

here
with
our
capital
oozing
away
into
lord
eastry
s
pockets
for
are
up
there
he
indicated
london
as
remotely
over
the
top
of
the
dispensing
counter
and
then
as
a
scene
of
great
activity
by
a
whirl
of
the
hand
and
a
wink
and
a
meaning
smile
at
me
what
sort
of
things

i
asked

one
way
george
then
another
way
there
s
corners
they
re
rather
big
things
aren
t
they
i
ventured
oh
if
you
go
in
for
wheat
or
steel
yes
but
suppose
you
tackled
a
little
thing
george
just
some
little
thing
that
only
needed
a
few
thousands
drugs
for
example
shoved
all
you
had
into
it
staked
your
liver
on
it
so
to
speak
take
a
drug
take
ipecac
for
example
take
a
lot
of
ipecac
take
all
there
is
see
there
you
are
there
aren
t
unlimited
supplies
of
ipecacuanha
can
t
be
and
it
s
a
thing
people
must
have
then
quinine
again
you
watch
your
chance
wait
for
a
tropical
war
breaking
out
let
s
say
and
collar
all
the
quinine
where
are
they
must
have
quinine
you
know
eh
zzzz
lord
there
s
no
end
of
things
no
end
of
little
things
all
the
suffering
babes
yowling
for
it
eucalyptus
again
cascara
witch
hazel
menthol
all
the
toothache
things
then
there
s
antiseptics
and
curare
cocaine
rather
a
nuisance
to
the
doctors
i
reflected
they
got
to
look
out
for
themselves
by
jove
yes
they
ll
do
you
if
they
can
and
you
do
them
like
brigands
that
makes
it
romantic
that
s
the
romance
of
commerce
george
you
re
in
the
mountains
there
think
of
having
all
the
quinine
in
the
world
and
some
millionaire
s
pampered
wife
gone
ill
with
malaria
eh
that
s
a
squeeze
george
eh
eh
millionaire
on
his
motor
car
outside
offering
you
any
price
you
liked
that
ud
wake
up
wimblehurst
lord
you
haven
t
an
idea
down
here
not
an
idea
he
passed
into
a
rapt
dream
from
which
escaped
such
fragments
as
fifty
per
cent
advance
sir
security
the
idea
of
cornering
a
drug
struck
upon
my
mind
then
as
a
sort
of
irresponsible
monkey
trick
that
no
one
would
ever
be
permitted
to
do
in
reality
it
was
the
sort
of
nonsense
one
would
talk
to
make
ewart
laugh
and
set
him
going
on
to
still
odder
possibilities
i
thought
it
was
part
of
my
uncle
s
way
of
talking
but
i
ve
learnt
differently
since
the
whole
trend
of
modern
is
to
foresee
something
that
will
presently
be
needed
and
put
it
out
of
reach
and
then
to
haggle
yourself
wealthy
you
buy
up
land
upon
which
people
will
presently
want
to
build
houses
you
secure
rights
that
will
bar
vitally
important
developments
and
so
on
and
so
on
of
course
the
naive
intelligence
of
a
boy
does
not
grasp
the
subtler
developments
of
human
inadequacy
he
begins
life
with
a
disposition
to
believe
in
the
wisdom
of
people
he
does
not
realise
how
casual
and
disingenuous
has
been
the
development
of
law
and
custom
and
he
thinks
that
somewhere
in
the
state
there
is
a
power
as
irresistible
as
a
head
master
s
to
check
mischievous
and
foolish
enterprises
of
every
sort
i
will
confess
that
when
my
uncle
talked
of
cornering
quinine
i
had
a
clear
impression
that
any
one
who
contrived
to
do
that
would
pretty
certainly
go
to
jail
now
i
know
that
any
one
who
could
really
bring
it
off
would
be
much
more
likely
to
go
to
the
house
of
lords
my
uncle
ranged
over
the
gilt
labels
of
his
bottles
and
drawers
for
a
while
dreaming
of
corners
in
this
and
that
but
at
last
he
reverted
to
wimblehurst
again
you
got
to
be
in
london
when
these
things
are
in
hand
down
here
he
cried
why
did
i
plant
myself
here
everything
s
done
the
game
s
over
here
s
lord
eastry
and
he
s
got
everything
except
what
his
lawyers
get
and
before
you
get
any
more
change
this
way
you
ll
have
to
dynamite
him
and
them
he
doesn
t
want
anything
more
to
happen
why
should
he
any
chance
ud
be
a
loss
to
him
he
wants
everything
to
burble
along
and
burble
along
and
go
on
as
it
s
going
for
the
next
ten
thousand
years
eastry
after
eastry
one
parson
down
another
come
one
grocer
dead
get
another
any
one
with
any
ideas
better
go
away
they
have
gone
away
look
at
all
these
blessed
people
in
this
place
look
at
em
all
fast
asleep
doing
their
business
out
of
habit
in
a
sort
of
dream
stuffed
men
would
do
just
as
well
just
they
ve
all
shook
down
into
their
places
they
don
t
want
anything
to
happen
either
they
re
all
broken
in
there
you
are
only
what
are
they
all
alive
for
why
can
t
they
get
a
clockwork
chemist
he
concluded
as
he
often
concluded
these
talks
i
must
invent
something
that
s
about
what
i
must
do
zzzz
some
convenience
something
people
want
strike
out
you
can
t
think
george
of
anything
everybody
wants
and
hasn
t
got
i
mean
something
you
could
turn
out
retail
under
a
shilling
say
well
you
think
whenever
you
haven
t
got
anything
better
to
do
see
ii
so
i
remember
my
uncle
in
that
first
phase
young
but
already
a
little
fat
restless
fretful
garrulous
putting
in
my
fermenting
head
all
sorts
of
discrepant
ideas
certainly
he
was
educational
for
me
the
years
at
wimblehurst
were
years
of
pretty
active
growth
most
of
my
leisure
and
much
of
my
time
in
the
shop
i
spent
in
study
i
speedily
mastered
the
modicum
of
latin
necessary
for
my
qualifying
examinations
and
a
little
assisted
by
the
government
science
and
art
department
classes
that
were
held
in
the
grammar
school
went
on
with
my
mathematics
there
were
classes
in
physics
in
chemistry
in
mathematics
and
machine
drawing
and
i
took
up
these
subjects
with
considerable
avidity
exercise
i
got
chiefly
in
the
form
of
walks
there
was
some
cricket
in
the
summer
and
football
in
the
winter
sustained
by
young
men
s
clubs
that
levied
a
parasitic
blackmail
of
the
big
people
and
the
sitting
member
but
i
was
never
very
keen
at
these
games
i
didn
t
find
any
very
close
companions
among
the
youths
of
wimblehurst
they
struck
me
after
my
cockney
schoolmates
as
loutish
and
slow
servile
and
furtive
spiteful
and
mean
we
used
to
swagger
but
these
countrymen
dragged
their
feet
and
hated
an
equal
who
didn
t
we
talked
loud
but
you
only
got
the
real
thoughts
of
wimblehurst
in
a
knowing
undertone
behind
its
hand
and
even
then
they
weren
t
much
in
the
way
of
thoughts
no
i
didn
t
like
those
young
countrymen
and
i
m
no
believer
in
the
english
countryside
under
the
bladesover
system
as
a
breeding
ground
for
honourable
men
one
hears
a
frightful
lot
of
nonsense
about
the
rural
exodus
and
the
degeneration
wrought
by
town
life
upon
our
population
to
my
mind
the
english
townsman
even
in
the
slums
is
infinitely
better
spiritually
more
courageous
more
imaginative
and
cleaner
than
his
agricultural
cousin
i
ve
seen
them
both
when
they
didn
t
think
they
were
being
observed
and
i
know
there
was
something
about
my
wimblehurst
companions
that
disgusted
me
it
s
hard
to
define
heaven
knows
that
at
that
cockney
at
goudhurst
we
were
coarse
enough
the
wimblehurst
youngsters
had
neither
words
nor
courage
for
the
sort
of
thing
we
used
to
do
for
our
bad
language
for
example
but
on
the
other
hand
they
displayed
a
sort
of
sluggish
real
lewdness
lewdness
is
the
word
a
baseness
of
attitude
whatever
we
exiled
urbans
did
at
goudhurst
was
touched
with
something
however
coarse
of
romantic
imagination
we
had
read
the
boys
of
england
and
told
each
other
stories
in
the
english
countryside
there
are
no
books
at
all
no
songs
no
drama
no
valiant
sin
even
all
these
things
have
never
come
or
they
were
taken
away
and
hidden
generations
ago
and
the
imagination
aborts
and
bestialises
that
i
think
is
where
the
real
difference
against
the
english
rural
man
lies
it
is
because
i
know
this
that
i
do
not
share
in
the
common
repinings
because
our
countryside
is
being
depopulated
because
our
population
is
passing
through
the
furnace
of
the
towns
they
starve
they
suffer
no
doubt
but
they
come
out
of
it
hardened
they
come
out
of
it
with
souls
of
an
evening
the
wimblehurst
blade
from
a
wash
and
with
some
loud
finery
a
coloured
waistcoat
or
a
vivid
tie
would
betake
himself
to
the
eastry
arms
or
to
the
bar
parlour
of
some
minor
pub
where
nap
could
be
played
one
soon
sickened
of
his
slow
knowingness
the
cunning
observation
of
his
deadened
eyes
his
idea
of
a
good
story
always
always
told
in
undertones
poor
dirty
worm
his
shrewd
elaborate
maneuvers
for
some
petty
advantage
a
drink
to
the
good
or
deal
there
rises
before
my
eyes
as
i
write
young
hopley
dodd
the
son
of
the
wimblehurst
auctioneer
the
pride
of
wimblehurst
its
finest
flower
with
his
fur
waistcoat
and
his
bulldog
pipe
his
riding
breeches
he
had
no
horse
and
his
gaiters
as
he
used
to
sit
leaning
forward
and
watching
the
from
under
the
brim
of
his
artfully
tilted
hat
a
phrases
constituted
his
conversation
hard
lines
he
used
to
say
and
good
baazness
in
a
bass
bleat
moreover
he
had
a
long
slow
whistle
that
was
esteemed
the
very
cream
of
humorous
comment
night
after
night
he
was
there
also
you
knew
he
would
not
understand
that
could
play
billiards
and
regarded
every
stroke
i
made
as
a
fluke
for
a
beginner
i
didn
t
play
so
badly
i
thought
i
m
not
so
sure
now
that
was
my
opinion
at
the
time
but
young
dodd
s
scepticism
and
the
good
baazness
finally
cured
me
of
my
disposition
to
frequent
the
eastry
arms
and
so
these
noises
had
their
value
in
my
world
i
made
no
friends
among
the
young
men
of
the
place
at
all
and
though
i
was
entering
upon
adolescence
i
have
no
to
tell
of
here
not
that
i
was
not
waking
up
to
that
aspect
of
life
in
my
middle
teens
i
did
indeed
in
various
slightly
informal
ways
scrape
acquaintance
with
casual
wimblehurst
girls
with
a
little
dressmaker
s
apprentice
i
got
upon
shyly
speaking
terms
and
a
pupil
teacher
in
the
national
school
went
further
and
was
talked
about
in
connection
with
me
but
i
was
not
by
any
means
touched
by
any
reality
of
passion
for
either
of
these
young
people
love
love
as
yet
came
to
me
only
in
my
dreams
i
only
kissed
these
girls
once
or
twice
they
rather
disconcerted
than
developed
those
dreams
they
were
so
clearly
not
i
shall
have
much
to
say
of
love
in
this
story
but
i
may
break
it
to
the
reader
now
that
it
is
my
role
to
be
a
rather
ineffectual
lover
desire
i
knew
well
enough
indeed
too
well
but
love
i
have
been
shy
of
in
all
my
early
enterprises
in
the
war
of
the
sexes
i
was
torn
between
the
urgency
of
the
body
and
a
habit
of
romantic
fantasy
that
wanted
every
phase
of
the
adventure
to
be
generous
and
beautiful
and
i
had
a
curiously
haunting
memory
of
beatrice
of
her
kisses
in
the
bracken
and
her
kiss
upon
the
wall
that
somehow
pitched
the
standard
too
high
for
wimblehurst
s
opportunities
i
will
not
deny
i
did
in
a
boyish
way
attempt
a
shy
rude
adventure
or
so
in
at
wimblehurst
but
through
these
various
influences
i
didn
t
bring
things
off
to
any
extent
at
all
i
left
behind
me
no
devastating
memories
no
splendid
reputation
i
came
away
at
last
still
inexperienced
and
a
little
thwarted
with
only
a
natural
growth
of
interest
and
desire
in
sexual
things
if
i
fell
in
love
with
any
one
in
wimblehurst
it
was
with
my
aunt
she
treated
me
with
a
kindliness
that
was
only
half
maternal
she
petted
my
books
she
knew
about
my
certificates
she
made
fun
of
me
in
a
way
that
stirred
my
heart
to
her
quite
unconsciously
i
grew
fond
of
her
my
adolescent
years
at
wimblehurst
were
on
the
whole
laborious
uneventful
years
that
began
in
short
jackets
and
left
me
in
many
ways
nearly
a
man
years
so
uneventful
that
the
calculus
of
variations
is
associated
with
one
winter
and
an
examination
in
physics
for
science
and
art
department
honours
marks
an
epoch
many
divergent
impulses
stirred
within
me
but
the
master
impulse
was
a
grave
young
disposition
to
work
and
learn
and
thereby
in
some
not
very
clearly
defined
way
get
out
of
the
wimblehurst
world
into
which
i
had
fallen
i
wrote
with
some
frequency
to
ewart
but
as
i
remember
them
not
intelligent
letters
dated
in
latin
and
with
lapses
into
latin
quotation
that
roused
ewart
to
parody
there
was
something
about
me
in
those
days
more
than
a
little
priggish
but
it
was
to
do
myself
justice
something
more
than
the
petty
pride
of
learning
i
had
a
very
grave
sense
of
discipline
and
preparation
that
i
am
not
ashamed
at
all
to
remember
i
was
serious
more
serious
than
i
am
at
the
present
time
more
serious
indeed
than
any
adult
seems
to
be
i
was
capable
then
of
efforts
of
nobilities
they
are
beyond
me
now
i
don
t
see
why
at
forty
i
shouldn
t
confess
i
respect
my
own
youth
i
had
dropped
being
a
boy
quite
abruptly
i
thought
i
was
presently
to
go
out
into
a
larger
and
quite
important
world
and
do
significant
things
there
i
thought
i
was
destined
to
do
something
definite
to
a
world
that
had
a
definite
purpose
i
did
not
understand
then
as
i
do
now
that
life
was
to
consist
largely
in
the
world
s
doing
things
to
me
young
people
never
do
seem
to
understand
that
aspect
of
things
and
as
i
say
among
my
educational
influences
my
uncle
all
unsuspected
played
a
leading
part
and
perhaps
among
other
things
gave
my
discontent
with
wimblehurst
my
desire
to
get
away
from
that
clean
and
picturesque
emptiness
a
form
and
expression
that
helped
to
emphasise
it
in
a
way
that
definition
made
me
patient
presently
i
shall
get
to
london
i
said
echoing
him
i
remember
him
now
as
talking
always
talking
in
those
days
he
talked
to
me
of
theology
he
talked
of
politics
of
the
wonders
of
science
and
the
marvels
of
art
of
the
passions
and
the
affections
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
and
the
peculiar
actions
of
drugs
but
predominantly
and
constantly
he
talked
of
getting
on
of
enterprises
of
inventions
and
great
fortunes
of
rothschilds
silver
kings
vanderbilts
goulds
flotations
realisations
and
the
marvelous
ways
of
chance
with
men
in
all
localities
that
is
to
say
that
are
not
absolutely
sunken
to
the
level
of
cold
mutton
fat
when
i
think
of
those
early
talks
i
figure
him
always
in
one
of
three
positions
either
we
were
in
the
dispensing
lair
behind
a
high
barrier
he
pounding
up
things
in
a
mortar
perhaps
and
i
rolling
into
long
rolls
and
cutting
it
up
with
a
sort
of
broad
fluted
knife
or
he
stood
looking
out
of
the
shop
door
against
the
case
of
sponges
and
while
i
surveyed
him
from
behind
the
counter
or
he
leant
against
the
little
drawers
behind
the
counter
and
i
hovered
dusting
in
front
the
thought
of
those
early
days
brings
back
to
my
nostrils
the
faint
smell
of
scent
that
was
always
in
the
air
marbled
now
with
streaks
of
this
drug
and
now
of
that
and
to
my
eyes
the
rows
of
jejune
glass
bottles
with
gold
labels
that
stood
behind
him
my
aunt
i
remember
used
sometimes
to
come
into
the
shop
in
a
state
of
aggressive
sprightliness
a
sort
of
connubial
ragging
expedition
and
get
much
fun
over
the
abbreviated
latinity
of
those
gilt
inscriptions
ol
amjig
george
she
would
read
derisively
and
he
pretends
it
s
almond
oil
snap
and
that
s
mustard
did
you
ever
george
look
at
him
george
looking
dignified
i
d
like
to
put
an
old
label
on
to
him
round
the
middle
like
his
bottles
are
with
ol
pondo
on
it
that
s
latin
for
impostor
george
must
be
he
d
look
lovely
with
a
you
want
a
stopper
said
my
uncle
projecting
his
face
my
aunt
dear
soul
was
in
those
days
quite
thin
and
slender
with
a
delicate
rosebud
completion
and
a
disposition
to
connubial
badinage
to
a
sort
of
gentle
skylarking
there
was
a
silvery
ghost
of
lisping
in
her
speech
she
was
a
great
humourist
and
as
the
constraint
of
my
presence
at
meals
wore
off
i
became
more
and
more
aware
of
a
filmy
but
extensive
net
of
nonsense
she
had
woven
about
her
domestic
relations
until
it
had
become
the
reality
of
her
life
she
affected
a
derisive
attitude
to
the
world
at
large
and
applied
the
epithet
old
to
more
things
than
i
have
ever
heard
linked
to
it
before
or
since
here
s
the
old
she
used
to
say
to
my
uncle
now
don
t
go
and
get
it
in
the
butter
you
silly
old
sardine
what
s
the
day
of
the
week
susan
my
uncle
would
ask
old
monday
sossidge
she
would
say
and
add
i
got
all
my
old
washing
to
do
don
t
i
know
it
she
had
evidently
been
the
wit
and
joy
of
a
large
circle
of
schoolfellows
and
this
style
had
become
a
second
nature
with
her
it
made
her
very
delightful
to
me
in
that
quiet
place
her
customary
walk
even
had
a
sort
of
hello
in
it
her
chief
preoccupation
in
life
was
i
believe
to
make
my
uncle
laugh
and
when
by
some
new
nickname
some
new
quaintness
or
absurdity
she
achieved
that
end
she
was
behind
a
mask
of
sober
amazement
the
happiest
woman
on
earth
my
uncle
s
laugh
when
it
did
come
i
must
admit
was
as
baedeker
says
it
began
with
gusty
blowings
and
snortings
and
opened
into
a
clear
ha
ha
but
in
fullest
development
it
included
in
those
youthful
days
falling
about
anyhow
and
doubling
up
tightly
and
whackings
of
the
stomach
and
tears
and
cries
of
anguish
i
never
in
my
life
heard
my
uncle
laugh
to
his
maximum
except
at
her
he
was
commonly
too
much
in
earnest
for
that
and
he
didn
t
laugh
much
at
all
to
my
knowledge
after
those
early
years
also
she
threw
things
at
him
to
an
enormous
extent
in
her
resolve
to
keep
things
lively
in
spite
of
wimblehurst
sponges
out
of
stock
she
threw
cushions
balls
of
paper
clean
washing
bread
and
once
up
the
yard
when
they
thought
that
i
and
the
errand
boy
and
the
diminutive
maid
of
all
work
were
safely
out
of
the
way
she
smashed
a
boxful
of
bottles
i
had
left
to
drain
assaulting
my
uncle
with
a
new
soft
broom
sometimes
she
would
shy
things
at
me
but
not
often
there
seemed
always
laughter
round
and
about
her
all
three
of
us
would
share
hysterics
at
times
and
on
one
occasion
the
two
of
them
came
home
from
church
shockingly
ashamed
of
themselves
because
of
a
storm
of
mirth
during
the
sermon
the
vicar
it
seems
had
tried
to
blow
his
nose
with
a
black
glove
as
well
as
the
customary
and
afterwards
she
had
picked
up
her
own
glove
by
the
finger
and
looking
innocently
but
intently
sideways
had
suddenly
by
this
simple
expedient
exploded
my
uncle
altogether
we
had
it
all
over
again
at
dinner
but
it
shows
you
cried
my
uncle
suddenly
becoming
grave
what
wimblehurst
is
to
have
us
all
laughing
at
a
little
thing
like
that
we
weren
t
the
only
ones
that
giggled
not
by
any
means
and
lord
it
was
funny
socially
my
uncle
and
aunt
were
almost
completely
isolated
in
places
like
wimblehurst
the
tradesmen
s
lives
always
are
isolated
socially
all
of
them
unless
they
have
a
sister
or
a
bosom
friend
among
the
other
wives
but
the
husbands
met
in
various
or
in
the
of
the
eastry
arms
but
my
uncle
for
the
most
part
spent
his
evenings
at
home
when
first
he
arrived
in
wimblehurst
i
think
he
had
spread
his
effect
of
abounding
ideas
and
enterprise
rather
too
aggressively
and
wimblehurst
after
a
temporary
subjugation
had
rebelled
and
done
its
best
to
make
a
butt
of
him
his
appearance
in
a
led
to
a
pause
in
any
conversation
that
was
going
on
come
to
tell
us
about
everything
pond
revo
some
one
would
say
politely
you
wait
my
uncle
used
to
answer
disconcerted
and
sulk
for
the
rest
of
his
visit
or
some
one
with
an
immense
air
of
innocence
would
remark
to
the
world
generally
they
re
talkin
of
rebuildin
wimblehurst
all
over
again
i
m
told
anybody
heard
anything
of
it
going
to
make
it
a
reg
lar
smartgoin
enterprisin
place
kind
of
crystal
earthquake
and
a
pestilence
before
you
get
that
my
uncle
would
mutter
to
the
infinite
delight
of
every
one
and
add
something
inaudible
about
cold
mutton
iii
we
were
torn
apart
by
a
financial
accident
to
my
uncle
of
which
i
did
not
at
first
grasp
the
full
bearings
he
had
developed
what
i
regarded
as
an
innocent
intellectual
recreation
which
he
called
meteorology
i
think
he
got
the
idea
from
one
use
of
curves
in
the
graphic
presentation
of
associated
variations
that
he
saw
me
plotting
he
secured
some
of
my
squared
paper
and
having
cast
about
for
a
time
decided
to
trace
the
rise
and
fall
of
certain
lines
and
railways
there
s
something
in
this
george
he
said
and
i
little
dreamt
that
among
other
things
that
were
in
it
was
the
whole
of
his
spare
money
and
most
of
what
my
mother
had
left
to
him
in
trust
for
me
it
s
as
plain
as
can
be
he
said
see
here
s
one
system
of
waves
and
here
s
another
these
are
prices
for
union
pacifics
extending
over
a
month
now
next
week
mark
my
words
they
ll
be
down
one
whole
point
we
re
getting
near
the
steep
part
of
the
curve
again
see
it
s
absolutely
scientific
it
s
verifiable
well
and
apply
it
you
buy
in
the
hollow
and
sell
on
the
crest
and
there
you
are
i
was
so
convinced
of
the
triviality
of
this
amusement
that
to
find
at
last
that
he
had
taken
it
in
the
most
disastrous
earnest
overwhelmed
me
he
took
me
for
a
long
walk
to
break
it
to
me
over
the
hills
towards
yare
and
across
the
great
gorse
commons
by
hazelbrow
there
are
ups
and
downs
in
life
george
he
said
halfway
across
that
great
open
space
and
paused
against
the
sky
i
left
out
one
factor
in
the
union
pacific
did
you
i
said
struck
by
the
sudden
chance
in
his
voice
but
you
don
t
mean
i
stopped
and
turned
on
him
in
the
narrow
sandy
rut
of
pathway
and
he
stopped
likewise
i
do
george
i
do
mean
it
s
bust
me
i
m
a
bankrupt
here
and
then
the
shop
s
bust
too
i
shall
have
to
get
out
of
and
me
oh
you
you
re
all
right
you
can
transfer
your
apprenticeship
and
er
well
i
m
not
the
sort
of
man
to
be
careless
with
trust
funds
you
can
be
sure
i
kept
that
aspect
in
mind
there
s
some
of
it
left
george
trust
me
quite
a
decent
little
but
you
and
aunt
it
isn
t
quite
the
way
we
meant
to
leave
wimblehurst
george
but
we
shall
have
to
go
sale
all
the
things
shoved
about
and
ticketed
lot
a
hundred
and
one
ugh
it
s
been
a
larky
little
house
in
some
ways
the
first
we
had
furnishing
a
spree
in
its
way
very
happy
his
face
winced
at
some
memory
let
s
go
on
george
he
said
shortly
near
choking
i
could
see
i
turned
my
back
on
him
and
did
not
look
round
again
for
a
little
while
that
s
how
it
is
you
see
i
heard
him
after
a
time
when
we
were
back
in
the
high
road
again
he
came
alongside
and
for
a
time
we
walked
in
silence
don
t
say
anything
home
yet
he
said
presently
fortunes
of
war
i
got
to
pick
the
proper
time
with
susan
else
she
ll
get
depressed
not
that
she
isn
t
a
brick
whatever
comes
all
right
i
said
i
ll
be
careful
and
it
seemed
to
me
for
the
time
altogether
too
selfish
to
bother
him
with
any
further
inquiries
about
his
responsibility
as
my
trustee
he
gave
a
little
sigh
of
relief
at
my
note
of
assent
and
was
presently
talking
quite
cheerfully
of
his
plans
but
he
had
i
remember
one
lapse
into
moodiness
that
came
and
went
suddenly
those
others
he
said
as
though
the
thought
had
stung
him
for
the
first
time
what
others
i
asked
damn
them
said
he
but
what
others
all
those
damned
tradespeople
ruck
the
butcher
marbel
the
grocer
snape
gord
george
how
they
ll
grin
i
thought
him
over
in
the
next
few
weeks
and
i
remember
now
in
great
detail
the
last
talk
we
had
together
before
he
handed
over
the
shop
and
me
to
his
successor
for
he
had
the
good
luck
to
sell
his
business
lock
stock
and
barrel
in
which
expression
i
found
myself
and
my
indentures
included
the
horrors
of
a
sale
by
auction
of
the
furniture
even
were
avoided
i
remember
that
either
coming
or
going
on
that
occasion
ruck
the
butcher
stood
in
his
doorway
and
regarded
us
with
a
grin
that
showed
his
long
teeth
you
hog
said
my
uncle
you
grinning
hyaena
and
then
pleasant
day
goin
to
make
your
fortun
in
london
then
said
ruck
with
slow
enjoyment
that
last
excursion
took
us
along
the
causeway
to
beeching
and
so
up
the
downs
and
round
almost
as
far
as
steadhurst
home
my
moods
as
we
went
made
a
mingled
web
by
this
time
i
had
really
grasped
the
fact
that
my
uncle
had
in
plain
english
robbed
me
the
little
accumulations
of
my
mother
six
hundred
pounds
and
more
that
would
have
educated
me
and
started
me
in
business
had
been
eaten
into
and
was
mostly
gone
into
the
unexpected
hollow
that
ought
to
have
been
a
crest
of
the
union
pacific
curve
and
of
the
remainder
he
still
gave
no
account
i
was
too
young
and
inexperienced
to
insist
on
this
or
know
how
to
get
it
but
the
thought
of
it
all
made
streaks
of
decidedly
black
anger
in
that
scheme
of
interwoven
feelings
and
you
know
i
was
also
acutely
sorry
for
him
almost
as
sorry
as
i
was
for
my
aunt
susan
even
then
i
had
quite
found
him
out
i
knew
him
to
be
weaker
than
myself
his
incurable
irresponsible
childishness
was
as
clear
to
me
then
as
it
was
on
his
deathbed
his
redeeming
and
excusing
imaginative
silliness
through
some
odd
mental
twist
perhaps
i
was
disposed
to
exonerate
him
even
at
the
cost
of
blaming
my
poor
old
mother
who
had
left
things
in
his
untrustworthy
hands
i
should
have
forgiven
him
altogether
i
believe
if
he
had
been
in
any
manner
apologetic
to
me
but
he
wasn
t
that
he
kept
reassuring
me
in
a
way
i
found
irritating
mostly
however
his
solicitude
was
for
aunt
susan
and
himself
it
s
these
crises
george
he
said
try
character
your
aunt
s
come
out
well
my
he
made
meditative
noises
for
a
space
had
her
cry
of
course
the
thing
had
been
only
too
painfully
evident
to
me
in
her
eyes
and
swollen
face
who
wouldn
t
but
now
buoyant
again
she
s
a
corker
we
ll
be
sorry
to
leave
the
little
house
of
course
it
s
a
bit
like
adam
and
eve
you
know
lord
what
a
chap
old
milton
was
the
world
was
all
before
them
where
to
choose
their
place
of
rest
and
providence
their
it
sounds
george
providence
their
guide
well
thank
goodness
there
s
no
imeedgit
prospect
of
either
cain
or
abel
after
all
it
won
t
be
so
bad
up
there
not
the
scenery
perhaps
or
the
air
we
get
here
but
life
we
ve
got
very
comfortable
little
rooms
very
comfortable
considering
and
i
shall
rise
we
re
not
done
yet
we
re
not
beaten
don
t
think
that
george
i
shall
pay
twenty
shillings
in
the
pound
before
i
ve
done
you
mark
my
words
george
twenty
five
to
you
i
got
this
situation
within
hours
others
offered
it
s
an
important
firm
one
of
the
best
in
london
i
looked
to
that
i
might
have
got
four
or
five
shillings
a
week
more
elsewhere
quarters
i
could
name
but
i
said
to
them
plainly
wages
to
go
on
with
but
opportunity
s
my
game
development
we
understood
each
he
threw
out
his
chest
and
the
little
round
eyes
behind
his
glasses
rested
valiantly
on
imaginary
employers
we
would
go
on
in
silence
for
a
space
while
he
revised
and
restated
that
encounter
then
he
would
break
out
abruptly
with
some
banal
phrase
the
battle
of
life
george
my
boy
he
would
cry
or
ups
and
downs
he
ignored
or
waived
the
poor
little
attempts
i
made
to
ascertain
my
own
position
that
s
all
right
he
would
say
or
leave
all
that
to
me
i
ll
look
after
and
he
would
drift
away
towards
the
philosophy
and
moral
of
the
situation
what
was
i
to
do
never
put
all
your
resources
into
one
chance
george
that
s
the
lesson
i
draw
from
this
have
forces
in
reserve
it
was
a
hundred
to
one
george
that
i
was
right
a
hundred
to
one
i
worked
it
out
afterwards
and
here
we
are
spiked
on
the
if
i
d
have
only
kept
back
a
little
i
d
have
had
it
on
next
day
like
a
shot
and
come
out
on
the
rise
there
you
are
his
thoughts
took
a
graver
turn
it
s
where
you
ll
bump
up
against
chance
like
this
george
that
you
feel
the
need
of
religion
your
scientific
men
your
spencers
and
huxleys
they
don
t
understand
that
i
do
i
ve
thought
of
it
a
lot
lately
in
bed
and
about
i
was
thinking
of
it
this
morning
while
i
shaved
it
s
not
irreverent
for
me
to
say
it
i
hope
but
god
comes
in
on
the
george
see
don
t
you
be
too
cocksure
of
anything
good
or
bad
that
s
what
i
make
out
of
it
i
could
have
sworn
well
do
you
think
i
particular
as
i
am
would
have
touched
those
union
pacifics
with
trust
money
at
all
if
i
hadn
t
thought
it
a
thoroughly
good
thing
good
without
spot
or
blemish
and
it
was
bad
it
s
a
lesson
to
me
you
start
in
to
get
a
hundred
percent
and
you
come
out
with
that
it
means
in
a
way
a
reproof
for
pride
i
ve
thought
of
that
george
in
the
night
watches
i
was
thinking
this
morning
when
i
was
shaving
that
that
s
where
the
good
of
it
all
comes
in
at
the
bottom
i
m
a
mystic
in
these
affairs
you
calculate
you
re
going
to
do
this
or
that
but
at
bottom
who
knows
at
all
what
he
s
doing
when
you
most
think
you
re
doing
things
they
re
being
done
right
over
your
head
you
re
being
done
in
a
sense
take
a
one
chance
or
one
to
a
hundred
what
does
it
matter
you
re
being
it
s
odd
that
i
heard
this
at
the
time
with
unutterable
contempt
and
now
that
i
recall
it
well
i
ask
myself
what
have
i
got
better
i
wish
said
i
becoming
for
a
moment
outrageous
you
were
being
led
to
give
me
some
account
of
my
money
not
without
a
bit
of
paper
to
figure
on
george
i
can
t
but
you
trust
me
about
that
never
fear
you
trust
and
in
the
end
i
had
to
i
think
the
bankruptcy
hit
my
aunt
pretty
hard
there
was
so
far
as
i
can
remember
now
a
complete
cessation
of
all
those
cheerful
outbreaks
of
elasticity
no
more
skylarking
in
the
shop
nor
scampering
about
the
house
but
there
was
no
fuss
that
i
saw
and
only
little
signs
in
her
complexion
of
the
fits
of
weeping
that
must
have
taken
her
she
didn
t
cry
at
the
end
though
to
me
her
face
with
its
strain
of
was
more
pathetic
than
any
weeping
well
she
said
to
me
as
she
came
through
the
shop
to
the
cab
here
s
old
orf
george
orf
to
mome
number
two
and
she
took
me
in
her
arms
and
kissed
me
and
pressed
me
to
her
then
she
dived
straight
for
the
cab
before
i
could
answer
her
my
uncle
followed
and
he
seemed
to
me
a
trifle
too
valiant
and
confident
in
his
bearing
for
reality
he
was
unusually
white
in
the
face
he
spoke
to
his
successor
at
the
counter
here
we
go
he
said
one
down
the
other
up
you
ll
find
it
a
quiet
little
business
so
long
as
you
run
it
on
quiet
lines
a
nice
quiet
little
business
there
s
nothing
more
no
well
if
you
want
to
know
anything
write
to
me
i
ll
always
explain
fully
anything
business
place
or
people
you
ll
find
pil
antibil
a
little
overstocked
i
found
it
soothed
my
mind
the
day
before
yesterday
making
em
and
i
made
em
all
day
thousands
and
where
s
george
ah
there
you
are
i
ll
write
to
you
george
fully
about
all
that
affair
fully
it
became
clear
to
me
as
if
for
the
first
time
that
i
was
really
parting
from
my
aunt
susan
i
went
out
on
to
the
pavement
and
saw
her
head
craned
forward
her
blue
eyes
and
her
little
face
intent
on
the
shop
that
had
combined
for
her
all
the
charms
of
a
big
doll
s
house
and
a
little
home
of
her
very
own
she
said
to
it
and
to
me
our
eyes
met
for
a
moment
perplexed
my
uncle
bustled
out
and
gave
a
few
totally
unnecessary
directions
to
the
cabman
and
got
in
beside
her
all
right
asked
the
driver
right
said
i
and
he
woke
up
the
horse
with
a
flick
of
his
whip
my
aunt
s
eyes
surveyed
me
again
stick
to
your
old
science
and
things
george
and
write
and
tell
me
when
they
make
you
a
professor
she
said
cheerfully
she
stared
at
me
for
a
second
longer
with
eyes
growing
wider
and
brighter
and
a
smile
that
had
become
fixed
glanced
again
at
the
bright
little
shop
still
saying
ponderevo
with
all
the
emphasis
of
its
fascia
and
then
flopped
back
hastily
out
of
sight
of
me
into
the
recesses
of
the
cab
then
it
had
gone
from
before
me
and
i
beheld
snape
the
hairdresser
inside
his
store
regarding
its
departure
with
a
quiet
satisfaction
and
exchanging
smiles
and
significant
headshakes
with
marbel
iv
i
was
left
i
say
as
part
of
the
lock
stock
and
barrel
at
wimblehurst
with
my
new
master
a
mantell
who
plays
no
part
in
the
progress
of
this
story
except
in
so
far
as
he
effaced
my
uncle
s
traces
so
soon
as
the
freshness
of
this
new
personality
faded
i
began
to
find
wimblehurst
not
only
a
dull
but
a
lonely
place
and
to
miss
my
aunt
susan
immensely
the
advertisements
of
the
summer
terms
for
cough
linctus
were
removed
the
bottles
of
coloured
water
red
green
and
yellow
restored
to
their
places
the
horse
announcing
veterinary
medicine
which
my
uncle
sizzling
all
the
while
had
coloured
in
careful
portraiture
of
a
goodwood
favourite
rewhitened
and
i
turned
myself
even
more
resolutely
than
before
to
latin
until
the
passing
of
my
preliminary
examination
enabled
me
to
drop
that
and
then
to
mathematics
and
science
there
were
classes
in
electricity
and
magnetism
at
the
grammar
school
i
took
a
little
elementary
prize
in
that
in
my
first
year
and
a
medal
in
my
third
and
in
chemistry
and
human
physiology
and
sound
light
and
heat
i
did
well
there
was
also
a
lighter
more
discursive
subject
called
physiography
in
which
one
ranged
among
the
sciences
and
encountered
geology
as
a
process
of
evolution
from
eozoon
to
eastry
house
and
astronomy
as
a
record
of
celestial
movements
of
the
most
austere
and
invariable
integrity
i
learnt
out
of
condensed
little
and
with
the
minimum
of
experiment
but
still
i
learnt
only
thirty
years
ago
it
was
and
i
remember
i
learnt
of
the
electric
light
as
an
expensive
impracticable
toy
the
telephone
as
a
curiosity
electric
traction
as
a
practical
absurdity
there
was
no
argon
no
radium
no
phagocytes
at
least
to
my
knowledge
and
aluminium
was
a
dear
infrequent
metal
the
fastest
ships
in
the
world
went
then
at
nineteen
knots
and
no
one
but
a
lunatic
here
and
there
ever
thought
it
possible
that
men
might
fly
many
things
have
happened
since
then
but
the
last
glance
i
had
of
wimblehurst
two
years
ago
remarked
no
change
whatever
in
its
pleasant
tranquillity
they
had
not
even
built
any
fresh
houses
at
least
not
actually
in
the
town
though
about
the
station
there
had
been
some
building
but
it
was
a
good
place
to
do
work
in
for
all
its
quiescence
i
was
soon
beyond
the
small
requirements
of
the
pharmaceutical
society
s
examination
and
as
they
do
not
permit
candidates
to
sit
for
that
until
one
and
twenty
i
was
presently
filling
up
my
time
and
preventing
my
studies
becoming
too
desultory
by
making
an
attack
upon
the
london
university
degree
of
bachelor
of
science
which
impressed
me
then
as
a
very
splendid
but
almost
impossible
achievement
the
degree
in
mathematics
and
chemistry
appealed
to
me
as
particularly
congenial
albeit
giddily
inaccessible
i
set
to
work
i
had
presently
to
arrange
a
holiday
and
go
to
london
to
matriculate
and
so
it
was
i
came
upon
my
aunt
and
uncle
again
in
many
ways
that
visit
marked
an
epoch
it
was
my
first
impression
of
london
at
all
i
was
then
nineteen
and
by
a
conspiracy
of
chances
my
nearest
approach
to
that
human
wilderness
had
been
my
brief
visit
to
chatham
chatham
too
had
been
my
largest
town
so
that
i
got
london
at
last
with
an
exceptional
freshness
of
effect
as
the
sudden
revelation
of
a
whole
unsuspected
other
side
to
life
i
came
to
it
on
a
dull
and
smoky
day
by
the
south
eastern
railway
and
our
train
was
half
an
hour
late
stopping
and
going
on
and
stopping
again
i
marked
beyond
chiselhurst
the
growing
multitude
of
villas
and
so
came
stage
by
stage
through
multiplying
houses
and
diminishing
interspaces
of
market
garden
and
dingy
grass
to
regions
of
interlacing
railway
lines
big
factories
gasometers
and
wide
reeking
swamps
of
dingy
little
homes
more
of
them
and
more
and
more
the
number
of
these
and
their
dinginess
and
poverty
increased
and
here
rose
a
great
public
house
and
here
a
board
school
and
there
a
gaunt
factory
and
away
to
the
east
there
loomed
for
a
time
a
queer
incongruous
forest
of
masts
and
spars
the
congestion
of
houses
intensified
and
piled
up
presently
into
tenements
i
marveled
more
and
more
at
this
boundless
world
of
dingy
people
whiffs
of
industrial
smell
of
leather
of
brewing
drifted
into
the
carriage
the
sky
darkened
i
rumbled
thunderously
over
bridges
streets
peered
down
on
and
crossed
the
thames
with
an
abrupt
eclat
of
sound
i
got
an
effect
of
tall
warehouses
of
grey
water
barge
crowded
of
broad
banks
of
indescribable
mud
and
then
i
was
in
cannon
street
station
a
monstrous
dirty
cavern
with
trains
packed
across
its
vast
floor
and
more
porters
standing
along
the
platform
than
i
had
ever
been
in
my
life
before
i
alighted
with
my
portmanteau
and
struggled
along
realising
for
the
first
time
just
how
small
and
weak
i
could
still
upon
occasion
feel
in
this
world
i
felt
an
honours
medal
in
electricity
and
magnetism
counted
for
nothing
at
all
afterwards
i
drove
in
a
cab
down
a
canon
of
rushing
street
between
high
warehouses
and
peeped
up
astonished
at
the
blackened
greys
of
saint
paul
s
the
traffic
of
cheapside
it
was
mostly
in
horse
omnibuses
in
those
days
seemed
stupendous
its
roar
was
stupendous
i
wondered
where
the
money
came
from
to
employ
so
many
cabs
what
industry
could
support
the
endless
jostling
stream
of
hurrying
men
down
a
turning
i
found
the
temperance
hotel
mantell
had
recommended
to
me
the
porter
in
a
green
uniform
who
took
over
my
portmanteau
seemed
i
thought
to
despise
me
a
good
deal
v
matriculation
kept
me
for
four
full
days
and
then
came
an
afternoon
to
spare
and
i
sought
out
tottenham
court
road
through
a
perplexing
network
of
various
and
crowded
streets
but
this
london
was
vast
it
was
endless
it
seemed
the
whole
world
had
changed
into
packed
frontages
and
hoardings
and
street
spaces
i
got
there
at
last
and
made
inquiries
and
i
found
my
uncle
behind
the
counter
of
the
pharmacy
he
managed
an
establishment
that
did
not
impress
me
as
doing
a
particularly
trade
lord
he
said
at
the
sight
of
me
i
was
wanting
something
to
happen
he
greeted
me
warmly
i
had
grown
taller
and
he
i
thought
had
grown
shorter
and
smaller
and
rounder
but
otherwise
he
was
unchanged
he
struck
me
as
being
rather
shabby
and
the
silk
hat
he
produced
and
put
on
when
after
mysterious
negotiations
in
the
back
premises
he
achieved
his
freedom
to
accompany
me
was
past
its
first
youth
but
he
was
as
buoyant
and
confident
as
ever
come
to
ask
me
about
all
that
he
cried
i
ve
never
written
oh
among
other
things
said
i
with
a
sudden
regrettable
politeness
and
waived
the
topic
of
his
trusteeship
to
ask
after
my
aunt
susan
we
ll
have
her
out
of
it
he
said
suddenly
we
ll
go
somewhere
we
don
t
get
you
in
london
every
it
s
my
first
visit
i
said
i
ve
never
seen
london
before
and
that
made
him
ask
me
what
i
thought
of
it
and
the
rest
of
the
talk
was
london
london
to
the
exclusion
of
all
smaller
topics
he
took
me
up
the
hampstead
road
almost
to
the
cobden
statue
plunged
into
some
back
streets
to
the
left
and
came
at
last
to
a
blistered
front
door
that
responded
to
his
one
of
a
long
series
of
blistered
front
doors
with
fanlights
and
apartment
cards
above
we
found
ourselves
in
a
passage
that
was
not
only
narrow
and
dirty
but
desolatingly
empty
and
then
he
opened
a
door
and
revealed
my
aunt
sitting
at
the
window
with
a
little
on
a
bamboo
occasional
table
before
her
and
work
a
walking
dress
i
judged
at
its
most
analytical
stage
scattered
over
the
rest
of
the
apartment
at
the
first
glance
i
judged
my
aunt
was
plumper
than
she
had
been
but
her
complexion
was
just
as
fresh
and
her
china
blue
eye
as
bright
as
in
the
old
days
london
she
said
didn
t
get
blacks
on
her
she
still
cheeked
my
uncle
i
was
pleased
to
find
what
are
you
old
poking
in
for
at
this
time
gubbitt
she
said
when
he
appeared
and
she
still
looked
with
a
practised
eye
for
the
facetious
side
of
things
when
she
saw
me
behind
him
she
gave
a
little
cry
and
stood
up
radiant
then
she
became
grave
i
was
surprised
at
my
own
emotion
in
seeing
her
she
held
me
at
arm
s
length
for
a
moment
a
hand
on
each
shoulder
and
looked
at
me
with
a
sort
of
glad
scrutiny
she
seemed
to
hesitate
and
then
pecked
little
kiss
off
my
cheek
you
re
a
man
george
she
said
as
she
released
me
and
continued
to
look
at
me
for
a
while
their
menage
was
one
of
a
very
common
type
in
london
they
occupied
what
is
called
the
floor
of
a
small
house
and
they
had
the
use
of
a
little
inconvenient
kitchen
in
the
basement
that
had
once
been
scullery
the
two
rooms
bedroom
behind
and
living
room
in
front
were
separated
by
that
were
never
now
thrown
back
and
indeed
in
the
presence
of
a
visitor
not
used
at
all
there
was
of
course
no
bathroom
or
anything
of
that
sort
available
and
there
was
no
water
supply
except
to
the
kitchen
below
my
aunt
did
all
the
domestic
work
though
she
could
have
afforded
to
pay
for
help
if
the
build
of
the
place
had
not
rendered
that
inconvenient
to
the
pitch
of
impossibility
there
was
no
sort
of
help
available
except
that
of
indoor
servants
for
whom
she
had
no
accommodation
the
furniture
was
their
own
it
was
partly
secondhand
but
on
the
whole
it
seemed
cheerful
to
my
eye
and
my
aunt
s
bias
for
cheap
muslin
had
found
ample
score
in
many
ways
i
should
think
it
must
have
been
an
extremely
inconvenient
and
cramped
sort
of
home
but
at
the
time
i
took
it
as
i
was
taking
everything
as
being
there
and
in
the
nature
of
things
i
did
not
see
the
oddness
of
solvent
decent
people
living
in
a
habitation
so
clearly
neither
designed
nor
adapted
for
their
needs
so
wasteful
of
labour
and
so
devoid
of
beauty
as
this
was
and
it
is
only
now
as
i
describe
this
that
i
find
myself
thinking
of
the
essential
absurdity
of
an
intelligent
community
living
in
such
makeshift
homes
it
strikes
me
now
as
the
next
thing
to
wearing
clothes
you
see
it
was
a
natural
growth
part
of
that
system
to
which
bladesover
i
hold
is
the
key
there
are
wide
regions
of
london
miles
of
streets
of
houses
that
appear
to
have
been
originally
designed
for
homes
of
the
early
victorian
type
there
must
have
been
a
perfect
fury
of
such
building
in
the
thirties
forties
and
fifties
street
after
street
must
have
been
rushed
into
being
campden
town
way
pentonville
way
brompton
way
west
kensington
way
in
the
victoria
region
and
all
over
the
minor
suburbs
of
the
south
side
i
am
doubtful
if
many
of
these
houses
had
any
long
use
as
the
residences
of
single
families
if
from
the
very
first
almost
their
tenants
did
not
makeshift
and
take
lodgers
and
sublet
they
were
built
with
basements
in
which
their
servants
worked
and
lived
servants
of
a
more
submissive
and
troglodytic
generation
who
did
not
mind
stairs
the
with
folding
doors
was
a
little
above
the
ground
level
and
in
that
the
wholesome
boiled
and
roast
with
damp
boiled
potatoes
and
then
pie
to
follow
was
consumed
and
the
numerous
family
read
and
worked
in
the
evening
and
above
was
the
also
with
folding
doors
where
the
infrequent
callers
were
received
that
was
the
vision
at
which
those
industrious
builders
aimed
even
while
these
houses
were
being
run
up
the
threads
upon
the
loom
of
fate
were
shaping
to
abolish
altogether
the
type
of
household
that
would
have
fitted
them
means
of
transit
were
developing
to
carry
the
moderately
prosperous
families
out
of
london
education
and
factory
employment
were
whittling
away
at
the
supply
of
rough
hardworking
obedient
girls
who
would
stand
the
subterranean
drudgery
of
these
places
new
classes
of
people
such
as
my
uncle
employees
of
various
types
were
coming
into
existence
for
whom
no
homes
were
provided
none
of
these
classes
have
ideas
of
what
they
ought
to
be
or
fit
in
any
legitimate
way
into
the
bladesover
theory
that
dominates
our
minds
it
was
nobody
s
concern
to
see
them
housed
under
civilised
conditions
and
the
beautiful
laws
of
supply
and
demand
had
free
play
they
had
to
squeeze
in
the
landlords
came
out
financially
intact
from
their
blundering
enterprise
more
and
more
these
houses
fell
into
the
hands
of
married
artisans
or
struggling
widows
or
old
servants
with
savings
who
became
responsible
for
the
quarterly
rent
and
tried
to
sweat
a
living
by
furnished
or
unfurnished
apartments
i
remember
now
that
a
poor
old
woman
who
had
an
air
of
having
been
roused
from
a
nap
in
the
dust
bin
came
out
into
the
area
and
looked
up
at
us
as
we
three
went
out
from
the
front
door
to
see
london
under
my
uncle
s
direction
she
was
the
occupier
she
squeezed
out
a
precarious
living
by
taking
the
house
whole
and
it
in
detail
and
she
made
her
food
and
got
the
shelter
of
an
attic
above
and
a
basement
below
by
the
transaction
and
if
she
didn
t
chance
to
let
steadily
out
she
went
to
pauperdom
and
some
other
poor
sordid
old
adventurer
tried
in
her
place
it
is
a
foolish
community
that
can
house
whole
classes
useful
and
helpful
honest
and
loyal
classes
in
such
squalidly
unsuitable
dwellings
it
is
by
no
means
the
social
economy
it
seems
to
use
up
old
women
savings
and
inexperience
in
order
to
meet
the
landlord
s
demands
but
any
one
who
doubts
this
thing
is
going
on
right
up
to
need
only
spend
an
afternoon
in
hunting
for
lodgings
in
any
of
the
regions
of
london
i
have
named
but
where
has
my
story
got
to
my
uncle
i
say
decided
i
must
be
shown
london
and
out
we
three
went
as
soon
as
my
aunt
had
got
her
hat
on
to
catch
all
that
was
left
of
the
day
vi
it
pleased
my
uncle
extremely
to
find
i
had
never
seen
london
before
he
took
possession
of
the
metropolis
forthwith
london
george
he
said
takes
a
lot
of
understanding
it
s
a
great
place
immense
the
richest
town
in
the
world
the
biggest
port
the
greatest
manufacturing
town
the
imperial
city
the
centre
of
civilisation
the
heart
of
the
world
see
those
sandwich
men
down
there
that
third
one
s
hat
fair
treat
you
don
t
see
poverty
like
that
in
wimblehurst
george
and
many
of
them
high
oxford
honour
men
too
brought
down
by
drink
it
s
a
wonderful
place
george
a
whirlpool
a
maelstrom
whirls
you
up
and
whirls
you
i
have
a
very
confused
memory
of
that
afternoon
s
inspection
of
london
my
uncle
took
us
to
and
fro
showing
us
over
his
london
talking
erratically
following
a
route
of
his
own
sometimes
we
were
walking
sometimes
we
were
on
the
tops
of
great
staggering
horse
omnibuses
in
a
heaving
jumble
of
traffic
and
at
one
point
we
had
tea
in
an
aerated
bread
shop
but
i
remember
very
distinctly
how
we
passed
down
park
lane
under
an
overcast
sky
and
how
my
uncle
pointed
out
the
house
of
this
child
of
good
fortune
and
that
with
succulent
appreciation
i
remember
too
that
as
he
talked
i
would
find
my
aunt
watching
my
face
as
if
to
check
the
soundness
of
his
talk
by
my
expression
been
in
love
yet
george
she
asked
suddenly
over
a
bun
in
the
too
busy
aunt
i
told
her
she
bit
her
bun
extensively
and
gesticulated
with
the
remnant
to
indicate
that
she
had
more
to
say
how
are
you
going
to
make
your
fortune
she
said
so
soon
as
she
could
speak
again
you
haven
t
told
us
lectricity
said
my
uncle
taking
breath
after
a
deep
draught
of
tea
if
i
make
it
at
all
i
said
for
my
part
i
think
shall
be
satisfied
with
something
less
than
a
we
re
going
to
make
ours
suddenly
she
said
so
he
old
she
jerked
her
head
at
my
uncle
he
won
t
tell
me
when
so
i
can
t
get
anything
ready
but
it
s
coming
going
to
ride
in
our
carriage
and
have
a
garden
garden
like
a
bishop
she
finished
her
bun
and
twiddled
crumbs
from
her
fingers
i
shall
be
glad
of
the
garden
she
said
it
s
going
to
be
a
real
big
one
with
rosaries
and
things
fountains
in
it
pampas
grass
you
ll
get
it
all
right
said
my
uncle
who
had
reddened
a
little
grey
horses
in
the
carriage
george
she
said
it
s
nice
to
think
about
when
one
s
dull
and
dinners
in
restaurants
often
and
often
and
theatres
in
the
stalls
and
money
and
money
and
you
may
joke
said
my
uncle
and
hummed
for
a
moment
just
as
though
an
old
porpoise
like
him
would
ever
make
money
she
said
turning
her
eyes
upon
his
profile
with
a
sudden
lapse
to
affection
he
ll
just
porpoise
i
ll
do
something
said
my
uncle
you
bet
zzzz
and
rapped
with
a
shilling
on
the
marble
table
when
you
do
you
ll
have
to
buy
me
a
new
pair
of
gloves
she
said
anyhow
that
finger
s
past
mending
look
you
cabbage
and
she
held
the
split
under
his
nose
and
pulled
a
face
of
comical
fierceness
my
uncle
smiled
at
these
sallies
at
the
time
but
afterwards
when
i
went
back
with
him
to
the
pharmacy
the
business
grew
brisker
in
the
evening
and
they
kept
open
late
he
reverted
to
it
in
a
low
expository
tone
your
aunt
s
a
bit
impatient
george
she
gets
at
me
it
s
only
natural
a
woman
doesn
t
understand
how
long
it
takes
to
build
up
a
position
no
in
certain
directions
now
i
am
quietly
building
up
a
position
now
here
i
get
this
room
i
have
my
three
assistants
zzzz
it
s
a
position
that
judged
by
the
criterion
of
imeedjit
income
isn
t
perhaps
so
good
as
i
deserve
but
strategically
yes
it
s
what
i
want
i
make
my
plans
i
rally
my
what
plans
i
said
are
you
making
well
george
there
s
one
thing
you
can
rely
upon
i
m
doing
nothing
in
a
hurry
i
turn
over
this
one
and
that
and
i
don
t
talk
indiscreetly
there
s
no
i
don
t
think
i
can
tell
you
that
and
yet
why
not
he
got
up
and
closed
the
door
into
the
shop
i
ve
told
no
one
he
remarked
as
he
sat
down
again
i
owe
you
his
face
flushed
slightly
he
leant
forward
over
the
little
table
towards
me
listen
he
said
i
listened
said
my
uncle
very
slowly
and
distinctly
i
thought
he
was
asking
me
to
hear
some
remote
strange
noise
i
don
t
hear
anything
i
said
reluctantly
to
his
expectant
face
he
smiled
undefeated
try
again
he
said
and
repeated
oh
that
i
said
eh
said
he
but
what
is
it
ah
said
my
uncle
rejoicing
and
expanding
what
is
it
that
s
what
you
got
to
ask
what
won
t
it
be
he
dug
me
violently
in
what
he
supposed
to
be
my
ribs
george
he
cried
george
watch
this
place
there
s
more
to
and
that
was
all
i
could
get
from
him
that
i
believe
was
the
very
first
time
that
the
words
ever
heard
on
earth
unless
my
uncle
indulged
in
monologues
in
his
chamber
a
highly
probable
thing
its
utterance
certainly
did
not
seem
to
me
at
the
time
to
mark
any
sort
of
epoch
and
had
i
been
told
this
word
was
the
open
sesame
to
whatever
pride
and
pleasure
the
grimy
front
of
london
hid
from
us
that
evening
i
should
have
laughed
aloud
coming
now
to
business
i
said
after
a
pause
and
with
a
chill
sense
of
effort
and
i
opened
the
question
of
his
trust
my
uncle
sighed
and
leant
back
in
his
chair
i
wish
i
could
make
all
this
business
as
clear
to
you
as
it
is
to
me
he
said
however
go
on
say
what
you
have
to
vii
after
i
left
my
uncle
that
evening
i
gave
way
to
a
feeling
of
profound
depression
my
uncle
and
aunt
seemed
to
me
to
be
leading
i
have
already
used
the
word
too
often
but
i
must
use
it
again
dingy
lives
they
seemed
to
be
adrift
in
a
limitless
crowd
of
dingy
people
wearing
shabby
clothes
living
uncomfortably
in
shabby
houses
going
to
and
fro
on
pavements
that
had
always
a
thin
veneer
of
greasy
slippery
mud
under
grey
skies
that
showed
no
gleam
of
hope
of
anything
for
them
but
dinginess
until
they
died
it
seemed
absolutely
clear
to
me
that
my
mother
s
little
savings
had
been
swallowed
up
and
that
my
own
prospect
was
all
too
certainly
to
drop
into
and
be
swallowed
up
myself
sooner
or
later
by
this
dingy
london
ocean
the
london
that
was
to
be
an
adventurous
escape
from
the
slumber
of
wimblehurst
had
vanished
from
my
dreams
i
saw
my
uncle
pointing
to
the
houses
in
park
lane
and
showing
a
frayed
as
he
did
so
i
heard
my
aunt
i
m
to
ride
in
my
carriage
then
so
he
old
my
feelings
towards
my
uncle
were
extraordinarily
mixed
i
was
intensely
sorry
not
only
for
my
aunt
susan
but
for
him
for
it
seemed
indisputable
that
as
they
were
living
then
so
they
must
go
on
and
at
the
same
time
i
was
angry
with
the
garrulous
vanity
and
illness
that
had
elipped
all
my
chance
of
independent
study
and
imprisoned
her
in
those
grey
apartments
when
i
got
back
to
wimblehurst
i
allowed
myself
to
write
him
a
boyishly
sarcastic
and
sincerely
bitter
letter
he
never
replied
then
believing
it
to
be
the
only
way
of
escape
for
me
i
set
myself
far
more
grimly
and
resolutely
to
my
studies
than
i
had
ever
done
before
after
a
time
i
wrote
to
him
in
more
moderate
terms
and
he
answered
me
evasively
and
then
i
tried
to
dismiss
him
from
my
mind
and
went
on
working
yes
that
first
raid
upon
london
under
the
moist
and
chilly
depression
of
january
had
an
immense
effect
upon
me
it
was
for
me
an
disappointment
i
had
thought
of
london
as
a
large
free
welcoming
adventurous
place
and
i
saw
it
slovenly
and
harsh
and
irresponsive
i
did
not
realise
at
all
what
human
things
might
be
found
behind
those
grey
frontages
what
weakness
that
whole
forbidding
facade
might
presently
confess
it
is
the
constant
error
of
youth
to
the
will
in
things
i
did
not
see
that
the
dirt
the
discouragement
the
discomfort
of
london
could
be
due
simply
to
the
fact
that
london
was
a
witless
old
giantess
of
a
town
too
slack
and
stupid
to
keep
herself
clean
and
maintain
a
brave
face
to
the
word
no
i
suffered
from
the
sort
of
illusion
that
burnt
witches
in
the
seventeenth
century
i
endued
her
grubby
disorder
with
a
sinister
and
magnificent
quality
of
intention
and
my
uncle
s
gestures
and
promises
filled
me
with
doubt
and
a
sort
of
fear
for
him
he
seemed
to
me
a
lost
little
creature
too
silly
to
be
silent
in
a
vast
implacable
condemnation
i
was
full
of
pity
and
a
sort
of
tenderness
for
my
aunt
susan
who
was
doomed
to
follow
his
erratic
fortunes
mocked
by
his
grandiloquent
promises
i
was
to
learn
better
but
i
worked
with
the
terror
of
the
grim
underside
of
london
in
my
soul
during
all
my
last
year
at
wimblehurst
book
the
second
the
rise
of
chapter
the
first
how
i
became
a
london
student
and
went
astray
i
came
to
live
in
london
as
i
shall
tell
you
when
i
was
nearly
wimblehurst
dwindles
in
perspective
is
now
in
this
book
a
little
place
far
off
bladesover
no
more
than
a
small
pinkish
speck
of
frontage
among
the
distant
kentish
hills
the
scene
broadens
out
becomes
multitudinous
and
limitless
full
of
the
sense
of
vast
irrelevant
movement
i
do
not
remember
my
second
coming
to
london
as
i
do
my
first
for
my
early
impressions
save
that
an
october
memory
of
softened
amber
sunshine
stands
out
amber
sunshine
falling
on
grey
house
fronts
i
know
not
where
that
and
a
sense
of
a
large
tranquillity
i
could
fill
a
book
i
think
with
a
more
or
less
imaginary
account
of
how
i
came
to
apprehend
london
how
first
in
one
aspect
and
then
in
another
it
grew
in
my
mind
each
day
my
accumulating
impressions
were
added
to
and
qualified
and
brought
into
relationship
with
new
ones
they
fused
inseparably
with
others
that
were
purely
personal
and
accidental
i
find
myself
with
a
certain
comprehensive
perception
of
london
complete
indeed
incurably
indistinct
in
places
and
yet
in
some
way
a
whole
that
began
with
my
first
visit
and
is
still
being
mellowed
and
enriched
london
at
first
no
doubt
it
was
a
chaos
of
streets
and
people
and
buildings
and
reasonless
going
to
and
fro
i
do
not
remember
that
i
ever
struggled
very
steadily
to
understand
it
or
explored
it
with
any
but
a
personal
and
adventurous
intention
yet
in
time
there
has
grown
up
in
me
a
kind
of
theory
of
london
i
do
think
i
see
lines
of
an
ordered
structure
out
of
which
it
has
grown
detected
a
process
that
is
something
more
than
a
confusion
of
casual
accidents
though
indeed
it
may
be
no
more
than
a
process
of
disease
i
said
at
the
outset
of
my
first
book
that
i
find
in
bladesover
the
clue
to
all
england
well
i
certainly
imagine
it
is
the
clue
to
the
structure
of
london
there
have
been
no
revolutions
no
deliberate
restatements
or
abandonments
of
opinion
in
england
since
the
days
of
the
fine
gentry
since
or
thereabouts
the
days
when
bladesover
was
built
there
have
been
changes
dissolving
forest
replacing
forest
if
you
will
but
then
it
was
that
the
broad
lines
of
the
english
system
set
firmly
and
as
i
have
gone
to
and
fro
in
london
in
certain
regions
constantly
the
thought
has
recurred
this
is
bladesover
house
this
answers
to
bladesover
house
the
fine
gentry
may
have
gone
they
have
indeed
largely
gone
i
think
rich
merchants
may
have
replaced
them
financial
adventurers
or
what
not
that
does
not
matter
the
shape
is
still
bladesover
i
am
most
reminded
of
bladesover
and
eastry
by
all
those
regions
round
about
the
west
end
parks
for
example
estate
parks
each
more
or
less
in
relation
to
a
palace
or
group
of
great
houses
the
roads
and
back
ways
of
mayfair
and
all
about
james
s
again
albeit
perhaps
of
a
later
growth
in
point
of
time
were
of
the
very
spirit
and
architectural
texture
of
the
bladesover
passages
and
yards
they
had
the
same
smells
the
space
the
large
cleanest
and
always
going
to
and
fro
where
one
met
unmistakable
olympians
and
even
more
unmistakable
valets
butlers
footmen
in
mufti
there
were
moments
when
i
seemed
to
glimpse
down
areas
the
white
panelling
the
very
chintz
of
my
mother
s
room
again
i
could
trace
out
now
on
a
map
what
i
would
call
the
region
passing
into
belgravia
becoming
diffused
and
sporadic
westward
finding
its
last
systematic
outbreak
round
and
about
regent
s
park
the
duke
of
devonshire
s
place
in
piccadilly
in
all
its
insolent
ugliness
pleases
me
particularly
it
is
the
quintessence
of
the
thing
apsley
house
is
all
in
the
manner
of
my
theory
park
lane
has
its
quite
typical
mansions
and
they
run
along
the
border
of
the
green
park
and
james
s
and
i
struck
out
a
truth
one
day
in
cromwell
road
quite
suddenly
as
i
looked
over
the
natural
history
museum
by
jove
said
i
but
this
is
the
little
assemblage
of
cases
of
stuffed
birds
and
animals
upon
the
bladesover
staircase
grown
enormous
and
yonder
as
the
corresponding
thing
to
the
bladesover
curios
and
porcelain
is
the
art
museume
and
there
in
the
little
observatories
in
exhibition
road
is
old
sir
cuthbert
s
gregorian
telescope
that
i
hunted
out
in
the
storeroom
and
put
and
diving
into
the
art
museum
under
this
inspiration
i
came
to
a
little
and
found
as
i
had
inferred
old
brown
books
it
was
really
a
good
piece
of
social
comparative
anatomy
i
did
that
day
all
these
museums
and
libraries
that
are
dotted
over
london
between
piccadilly
and
west
kensington
and
indeed
the
museum
and
library
movement
throughout
the
world
sprang
from
the
elegant
leisure
of
the
gentlemen
of
taste
theirs
were
the
first
libraries
the
first
houses
of
culture
by
my
raids
into
the
bladesover
saloon
i
became
as
it
were
the
last
dwindled
representative
of
such
a
man
of
letters
as
swift
but
now
these
things
have
escaped
out
of
the
great
house
altogether
and
taken
on
a
strange
independent
life
of
their
own
it
is
this
idea
of
escaping
parts
from
the
seventeenth
century
system
of
bladesover
of
proliferating
and
overgrowing
elements
from
the
estates
that
to
this
day
seems
to
me
the
best
explanation
not
simply
of
london
but
of
all
england
england
is
a
country
of
great
renascence
landed
gentlefolk
who
have
been
unconsciously
outgrown
and
overgrown
the
proper
shops
for
bladesover
custom
were
still
to
be
found
in
regent
street
and
bond
street
in
my
early
london
days
in
those
days
they
had
been
but
lightly
touched
by
the
american
s
profaning
hand
and
in
piccadilly
i
found
the
doctor
s
house
of
the
country
village
or
country
town
up
and
down
harley
street
multiplied
but
not
otherwise
different
and
the
family
solicitor
by
the
hundred
further
eastward
in
the
abandoned
houses
of
a
previous
generation
of
gentlepeople
and
down
in
westminster
behind
palladian
fronts
the
public
offices
sheltered
in
large
bladesoverish
rooms
and
looked
out
on
james
s
park
the
parliament
houses
of
lords
and
gentlemen
the
parliament
house
that
was
horrified
when
merchants
and
brewers
came
thrusting
into
it
a
hundred
years
ago
stood
out
upon
its
terrace
gathering
the
whole
system
together
into
a
head
and
the
more
i
have
paralleled
these
things
with
my
model
the
more
evident
it
has
become
to
me
that
the
balance
is
not
the
same
and
the
more
evident
is
the
presence
of
great
new
forces
blind
forces
of
invasion
of
growth
the
railway
termini
on
the
north
side
of
london
have
been
kept
as
remote
as
eastry
had
kept
the
from
wimblehurst
they
stop
on
the
very
outskirts
of
the
estates
but
from
the
south
the
south
eastern
railway
had
butted
its
great
stupid
rusty
iron
head
of
charing
cross
station
that
great
head
that
came
smashing
down
in
clean
across
the
river
between
somerset
house
and
whitehall
the
south
side
had
no
protecting
estate
factory
chimneys
smoke
right
over
against
westminster
with
an
air
of
carelessly
not
having
permission
and
the
whole
effect
of
industrial
london
and
of
all
london
east
of
temple
bar
and
of
the
huge
dingy
immensity
of
london
port
is
to
me
of
something
disproportionately
large
something
morbidly
expanded
without
plan
or
intention
dark
and
sinister
toward
the
clean
clear
social
assurance
of
the
west
end
and
south
of
this
central
london
far
west
all
round
the
northern
hills
are
similar
disproportionate
growths
endless
streets
of
undistinguished
houses
undistinguished
industries
shabby
families
shops
inexplicable
people
who
in
a
once
fashionable
phrase
do
not
all
these
aspects
have
suggested
to
my
mind
at
times
do
suggest
to
this
day
the
unorganised
abundant
substance
of
some
tumorous
a
process
which
indeed
bursts
all
the
outlines
of
the
affected
carcass
and
protrudes
such
masses
as
ignoble
comfortable
croydon
as
tragic
impoverished
west
ham
to
this
day
i
ask
myself
will
those
masses
ever
become
structural
will
they
indeed
shape
into
anything
new
whatever
or
is
that
cancerous
image
their
true
and
ultimate
diagnosis
moreover
together
with
this
hypertrophy
there
is
an
immigration
of
elements
that
have
never
understood
and
never
will
understand
the
great
tradition
wedges
of
foreign
settlement
embedded
in
the
heart
of
this
yeasty
english
expansion
one
day
i
remember
wandering
eastward
out
of
pure
curiosity
it
must
have
been
in
my
early
student
days
and
discovering
a
shabbily
bright
foreign
quarter
shops
displaying
hebrew
placards
and
weird
unfamiliar
commodities
and
a
concourse
of
people
talking
some
incomprehensible
gibberish
between
the
shops
and
the
barrows
and
soon
i
became
quite
familiar
with
the
devious
vicious
eroticism
of
soho
i
found
those
crowded
streets
a
vast
relief
from
the
dull
grey
exterior
of
brompton
where
i
lodged
and
lived
my
daily
life
in
soho
indeed
i
got
my
first
inkling
of
the
factor
of
replacement
that
is
so
important
in
both
the
english
and
the
american
process
even
in
the
west
end
in
mayfair
and
the
square
about
pall
mall
ewart
was
presently
to
remind
me
the
face
of
the
old
aristocratic
dignity
was
fairer
than
its
substance
here
were
actors
and
actresses
here
money
lenders
and
jews
here
bold
financial
adventurers
and
i
thought
of
my
uncle
s
frayed
cuff
as
he
pointed
out
this
house
in
park
lane
and
that
that
was
so
and
so
s
who
made
a
corner
in
borax
and
that
palace
belonged
to
that
hero
among
modern
adventurers
barmentrude
who
used
to
be
an
an
illicit
diamond
buyer
that
is
to
say
a
city
of
bladesovers
the
capital
of
a
kingdom
of
bladesovers
all
much
shaken
and
many
altogether
in
decay
parasitically
occupied
insidiously
replaced
by
alien
unsympathetic
and
irresponsible
elements
and
with
a
ruling
an
adventitious
and
miscellaneous
empire
of
a
quarter
of
this
daedal
earth
complex
laws
intricate
social
necessities
disturbing
insatiable
suggestions
followed
from
this
such
was
the
world
into
which
i
had
come
into
which
i
had
in
some
way
to
thrust
myself
and
fit
my
problem
my
temptations
my
efforts
my
patriotic
instinct
all
my
moral
instincts
my
physical
appetites
my
dreams
and
my
sanity
london
i
came
up
to
it
young
and
without
advisers
rather
priggish
rather
dangerously
and
very
and
with
something
it
is
i
think
the
common
gift
of
imaginative
youth
and
i
claim
it
unblushingly
fine
in
me
finer
than
the
world
and
seeking
fine
responses
i
did
not
want
simply
to
live
or
simply
to
live
happily
or
well
i
wanted
to
serve
and
do
and
make
with
some
nobility
it
was
in
me
it
is
in
half
the
youth
of
the
world
ii
i
had
come
to
london
as
a
scholar
i
had
taken
the
vincent
bradley
scholarship
of
the
pharmaceutical
society
but
i
threw
this
up
when
i
found
that
my
work
of
the
science
and
art
department
in
mathematics
physics
and
chemistry
had
given
me
one
of
the
minor
technical
board
scholarships
at
the
consolidated
technical
schools
at
south
kensington
this
latter
was
in
mechanics
and
metallurgy
and
i
hesitated
between
the
two
the
vincent
bradley
gave
me
a
year
and
quite
the
best
a
pharmaceutical
chemist
could
have
the
south
kensington
thing
was
worth
about
shillings
a
week
and
the
prospects
it
opened
were
vague
but
it
meant
far
more
scientific
work
than
the
former
and
i
was
still
under
the
impulse
of
that
great
intellectual
appetite
that
is
part
of
the
adolescence
of
men
of
my
type
moreover
it
seemed
to
lead
towards
engineering
in
which
i
imagined
i
imagine
to
this
day
my
particular
use
is
to
be
found
i
took
its
greater
uncertainty
as
a
fair
risk
i
came
up
very
keen
not
doubting
that
the
really
hard
and
steady
industry
that
had
carried
me
through
wimblehurst
would
go
on
still
in
the
new
surroundings
only
from
the
very
first
it
didn
t
when
i
look
back
now
at
my
wimblehurst
days
i
still
find
myself
surprised
at
the
amount
of
steady
grinding
study
of
strenuous
that
i
maintained
throughout
my
apprenticeship
in
many
ways
i
think
that
time
was
the
most
honourable
period
in
my
life
i
wish
i
could
say
with
a
certain
mind
that
my
motives
in
working
so
well
were
large
and
honourable
too
to
a
certain
extent
they
were
so
there
was
a
fine
sincere
curiosity
a
desire
for
the
strength
and
power
of
scientific
knowledge
and
a
passion
for
intellectual
exercise
but
i
do
not
think
those
forces
alone
would
have
kept
me
at
it
so
grimly
and
closely
if
wimblehurst
had
not
been
so
dull
so
limited
and
so
observant
directly
i
came
into
the
london
atmosphere
tasting
freedom
tasting
irresponsibility
and
the
pull
of
new
forces
altogether
my
discipline
fell
from
me
like
a
garment
wimblehurst
to
a
youngster
in
my
position
offered
no
temptations
worth
counting
no
interests
to
conflict
with
study
no
vices
such
vices
as
it
offered
were
coarsely
stripped
of
any
imaginative
glamourfull
drunkenness
clumsy
leering
shameful
lust
no
social
intercourse
even
to
waste
one
s
time
and
on
the
other
hand
it
would
minister
greatly
to
the
of
a
conspicuously
industrious
student
one
was
marked
as
clever
one
played
up
to
the
part
and
one
s
little
accomplishment
stood
out
finely
in
one
s
private
reckoning
against
the
sunlit
small
ignorance
of
that
agreeable
place
one
went
with
an
intent
rush
across
the
market
square
one
took
one
s
exercise
with
as
dramatic
a
sense
of
an
ordered
day
as
an
oxford
don
one
burnt
the
midnight
oil
quite
consciously
at
the
rare
respectful
benighted
and
one
stood
out
finely
in
the
local
paper
with
one
s
unapproachable
yearly
harvest
of
certificates
thus
i
was
not
only
a
genuinely
keen
student
but
also
a
little
of
a
prig
and
poseur
in
those
days
and
the
latter
kept
the
former
at
it
as
london
made
clear
moreover
wimblehurst
had
given
me
no
outlet
in
any
other
direction
but
i
did
not
realise
all
this
when
i
came
to
london
did
not
perceive
how
the
change
of
atmosphere
began
at
once
to
warp
and
distribute
my
energies
in
the
first
place
i
became
invisible
if
i
idled
for
a
day
no
one
except
my
who
evidently
had
no
awe
for
me
remarked
it
no
one
saw
my
midnight
taper
no
one
pointed
me
out
as
i
crossed
the
street
as
an
astonishing
intellectual
phenomenon
in
the
next
place
i
became
inconsiderable
in
wimblehurst
i
felt
i
stood
for
science
nobody
there
seemed
to
have
so
much
as
i
and
to
have
it
so
fully
and
completely
in
london
i
walked
ignorant
in
an
immensity
and
it
was
clear
that
among
my
from
the
midlands
and
the
north
i
was
and
with
the
utmost
exertion
i
should
only
take
a
secondary
position
among
them
and
finally
in
the
third
place
i
was
distracted
by
voluminous
new
interests
london
took
hold
of
me
and
science
which
had
been
the
universe
shrank
back
to
the
dimensions
of
tiresome
little
formulae
compacted
in
a
book
i
came
to
london
in
late
september
and
it
was
a
very
different
london
from
that
great
of
my
first
impressions
i
reached
it
by
victoria
and
not
by
cannon
street
and
its
centre
was
now
in
exhibition
road
it
shone
pale
amber
and
tenderly
spacious
and
fine
under
clear
autumnal
skies
a
london
of
hugely
handsome
buildings
and
vistas
and
distances
a
london
of
gardens
and
labyrinthine
tall
museums
of
old
trees
and
remote
palaces
and
artificial
waters
i
lodged
near
by
in
west
brompton
at
a
house
in
a
little
square
so
london
faced
me
the
second
time
making
me
forget
altogether
for
a
while
the
grey
drizzling
city
visage
that
had
first
looked
upon
me
i
settled
down
and
went
to
and
fro
to
my
lectures
and
laboratory
in
the
beginning
i
worked
hard
and
only
slowly
did
the
curiosity
that
presently
possessed
me
to
know
more
of
this
huge
urban
province
arise
the
desire
to
find
something
beyond
mechanism
that
i
could
serve
some
use
other
than
learning
with
this
was
a
growing
sense
of
loneliness
a
desire
for
adventure
and
intercourse
i
found
myself
in
the
evenings
poring
over
a
map
of
london
i
had
bought
instead
of
copying
out
lecture
notes
and
on
sundays
i
made
explorations
taking
omnibus
rides
east
and
west
and
north
and
south
and
to
enlarging
and
broadening
the
sense
of
great
swarming
hinterlands
of
humanity
with
whom
i
had
no
dealings
of
whom
i
knew
nothing
the
whole
illimitable
place
teemed
with
suggestions
of
indefinite
and
sometimes
outrageous
possibility
of
hidden
but
magnificent
meanings
it
wasn
t
simply
that
i
received
a
vast
impression
of
space
and
multitude
and
opportunity
intimate
things
also
were
suddenly
dragged
from
neglected
veiled
and
darkened
corners
into
an
acute
vividness
of
perception
close
at
hand
in
the
big
art
museum
i
came
for
the
first
time
upon
the
beauty
of
nudity
which
i
had
hitherto
held
to
be
a
shameful
secret
flaunted
and
gloried
in
i
was
made
aware
of
beauty
as
not
only
permissible
but
desirable
and
frequent
and
of
a
thousand
hitherto
unsuspected
rich
aspects
of
life
one
night
in
a
real
rapture
i
walked
round
the
upper
gallery
of
the
albert
hall
and
listened
for
the
first
time
to
great
music
i
believe
now
that
it
was
a
rendering
of
beethoven
s
ninth
symphony
my
apprehension
of
spaces
and
places
was
reinforced
by
a
quickened
apprehension
of
persons
a
constant
stream
of
people
passed
by
me
eyes
met
and
challenged
mine
and
passed
more
and
more
i
wanted
then
to
stay
if
i
went
eastward
towards
piccadilly
women
who
seemed
then
to
my
boyish
inexperience
softly
splendid
and
alluring
murmured
to
me
as
they
passed
extraordinarily
life
unveiled
the
very
hoardings
clamoured
strangely
at
one
s
senses
and
curiosities
one
bought
pamphlets
and
papers
full
of
strange
and
daring
ideas
transcending
one
s
boldest
in
the
parks
one
heard
men
discussing
the
very
existence
of
god
denying
the
rights
of
property
debating
a
hundred
things
that
one
dared
not
think
about
in
wimblehurst
and
after
the
ordinary
overcast
day
after
dull
mornings
came
twilight
and
london
lit
up
and
became
a
thing
of
white
and
yellow
and
red
jewels
of
light
and
wonderful
floods
of
golden
illumination
and
stupendous
and
unfathomable
shadows
and
there
were
no
longer
any
mean
or
shabby
people
but
a
great
mysterious
movement
of
unaccountable
beings
always
i
was
coming
on
the
queerest
new
aspects
late
one
saturday
night
i
found
myself
one
of
a
great
crowd
between
the
blazing
shops
and
the
flaring
barrows
in
the
harrow
road
i
got
into
conversation
with
two
girls
bought
them
boxes
of
chocolate
made
the
acquaintance
of
father
and
mother
and
various
younger
brothers
and
sisters
sat
in
a
hilariously
with
them
all
standing
and
being
stood
drinks
and
left
them
in
the
small
hours
at
the
door
of
home
never
to
see
them
again
and
once
i
was
accosted
on
the
outskirts
of
a
salvation
army
meeting
in
one
of
the
parks
by
a
young
man
of
eager
and
serious
discourse
who
argued
against
scepticism
with
me
invited
me
home
to
tea
into
a
clean
and
cheerful
family
of
brothers
and
sisters
and
friends
and
there
i
spent
the
evening
singing
hymns
to
the
harmonium
which
reminded
me
of
chatham
and
wishing
all
the
sisters
were
not
so
obviously
engaged
then
on
the
remote
hill
of
this
boundless
i
found
ewart
iii
how
well
i
remember
the
first
morning
a
bright
sunday
morning
in
early
october
when
i
raided
in
upon
ewart
i
found
my
old
schoolfellow
in
bed
in
a
room
over
an
in
a
back
street
at
the
foot
of
highgate
hill
his
landlady
a
pleasant
dirty
young
woman
with
eyes
brought
down
his
message
for
me
to
come
up
and
up
i
went
the
room
presented
itself
as
ample
and
interesting
in
detail
and
shabby
with
a
quite
commendable
shabbiness
i
had
an
impression
of
brown
walls
they
were
papered
with
brown
paper
of
a
long
shelf
along
one
side
of
the
room
with
dusty
plaster
casts
and
a
small
cheap
lay
figure
of
a
horse
of
a
table
and
something
of
grey
wax
partially
covered
with
a
cloth
and
of
scattered
drawings
there
was
a
gas
stove
in
one
corner
and
some
enameled
ware
that
had
been
used
for
overnight
cooking
the
oilcloth
on
the
floor
was
streaked
with
a
peculiar
white
dust
ewart
himself
was
not
in
the
first
instance
visible
but
only
a
fourfold
canvas
screen
at
the
end
of
the
room
from
which
shouts
proceeded
of
come
on
then
his
wiry
black
hair
very
much
rumpled
and
a
staring
eye
and
his
stump
of
a
nose
came
round
the
edge
of
this
at
a
height
of
about
three
feet
from
the
ground
it
s
old
ponderevo
he
said
the
early
bird
and
he
s
caught
the
worm
by
jove
but
it
s
cold
this
morning
come
round
here
and
sit
on
the
bed
i
walked
round
wrung
his
hand
and
we
surveyed
one
another
he
was
lying
on
a
small
wooden
bed
the
scanty
covering
of
which
was
supplemented
by
an
overcoat
and
an
elderly
but
still
cheerful
pair
of
check
trousers
and
he
was
wearing
pajamas
of
a
virulent
pink
and
green
his
neck
seemed
longer
and
more
stringy
than
it
had
been
even
in
our
schooldays
and
his
upper
lip
had
a
wiry
black
moustache
the
rest
of
his
ruddy
knobby
countenance
his
erratic
hair
and
his
general
hairy
leanness
had
not
even
to
my
perceptions
grown
by
jove
he
said
you
ve
got
quite
ponderevo
what
do
you
think
of
me
you
re
all
right
what
are
you
doing
here
art
my
son
sculpture
and
incidentally
he
hesitated
i
ply
a
trade
will
you
hand
me
that
pipe
and
those
smoking
things
so
you
can
t
make
coffee
eh
well
try
your
hand
cast
down
this
screen
no
fold
it
up
and
so
we
ll
go
into
the
other
room
i
ll
keep
in
bed
all
the
same
the
fire
s
a
gas
stove
yes
don
t
make
it
bang
too
loud
as
you
light
it
i
can
t
stand
it
this
morning
you
won
t
smoke
well
it
does
me
good
to
see
you
again
ponderevo
tell
me
what
you
re
doing
and
how
you
re
getting
he
directed
me
in
the
service
of
his
simple
hospitality
and
presently
i
came
back
to
his
bed
and
sat
down
and
smiled
at
him
there
smoking
comfortably
with
his
hands
under
his
head
surveying
me
how
s
life
s
morning
ponderevo
by
jove
it
must
be
nearly
six
years
since
we
met
they
ve
got
moustaches
we
ve
fleshed
ourselves
a
bit
eh
and
you
i
felt
a
pipe
was
becoming
after
all
and
that
lit
i
gave
him
a
favourable
sketch
of
my
career
science
and
you
ve
worked
like
that
while
i
ve
been
potting
round
doing
odd
jobs
for
and
people
and
trying
to
get
to
sculpture
i
ve
a
sort
of
feeling
that
the
chisel
i
began
with
painting
ponderevo
and
found
i
was
enough
to
stop
it
i
ve
drawn
about
and
thought
about
thought
more
particularly
i
give
myself
three
days
a
week
as
an
art
student
and
the
rest
of
the
time
i
ve
a
sort
of
trade
that
keeps
me
and
we
re
still
in
the
beginning
of
things
young
men
starting
do
you
remember
the
old
times
at
goudhurst
our
doll
island
the
retreat
of
the
ten
thousand
young
holmes
and
the
rabbits
eh
it
s
surprising
if
you
think
of
it
to
find
we
are
still
young
and
we
used
to
talk
of
what
we
would
be
and
we
used
to
talk
of
love
i
suppose
you
know
all
about
that
now
ponderevo
i
finished
and
hesitated
on
some
vague
foolish
lie
no
i
said
a
little
ashamed
of
the
truth
do
you
i
ve
been
too
i
m
just
beginning
just
as
we
were
then
things
he
sucked
at
his
pipe
for
a
space
and
stared
at
the
plaster
cast
of
a
flayed
hand
that
hung
on
the
wall
the
fact
is
ponderevo
i
m
beginning
to
find
life
a
most
extraordinary
queer
the
things
that
pull
one
the
things
that
don
t
the
wants
this
business
of
sex
it
s
a
net
no
end
to
it
no
way
out
of
it
no
sense
in
it
there
are
times
when
women
take
possession
of
me
when
my
mind
is
like
a
painted
ceiling
at
hampton
court
with
the
pride
of
the
flesh
sprawling
all
over
it
why
and
then
again
sometimes
when
i
have
to
encounter
a
woman
i
am
overwhelmed
by
a
terror
of
tantalising
boredom
i
fly
i
hide
i
do
anything
you
ve
got
your
scientific
explanations
perhaps
what
s
nature
and
the
universe
up
to
in
that
matter
it
s
her
way
i
gather
of
securing
the
continuity
of
the
but
it
doesn
t
said
ewart
that
s
just
it
no
i
have
succumbed
to
dissipation
down
the
hill
there
euston
road
way
and
it
was
damned
ugly
and
mean
and
i
hate
having
done
it
and
the
continuity
of
the
species
lord
and
why
does
nature
make
a
man
so
infernally
ready
for
drinks
there
s
no
sense
in
that
he
sat
up
in
bed
to
put
this
question
with
the
greater
earnestness
and
why
has
she
given
me
a
most
violent
desire
towards
sculpture
and
an
equally
violent
desire
to
leave
off
work
directly
i
begin
it
eh
let
s
have
some
more
coffee
i
put
it
to
you
these
things
puzzle
me
ponderevo
they
dishearten
me
they
keep
me
in
he
had
an
air
of
having
saved
up
these
difficulties
for
me
for
some
time
he
sat
with
his
chin
almost
touching
his
knees
sucking
at
his
pipe
that
s
what
i
mean
he
went
on
when
i
say
life
is
getting
on
to
me
as
extraordinarily
queer
i
don
t
see
my
game
nor
why
i
was
invited
and
i
don
t
make
anything
of
the
world
outside
either
what
do
you
make
of
it
london
i
began
it
s
so
enormous
isn
t
it
and
it
s
all
up
to
nothing
you
find
chaps
keeping
grocers
shops
why
the
devil
ponderevo
do
they
keep
grocers
shops
they
all
do
it
very
carefully
very
steadily
very
meanly
you
find
people
running
about
and
doing
the
most
remarkable
things
being
policemen
for
example
and
burglars
they
go
about
these
businesses
quite
gravely
and
earnestly
i
somehow
can
t
go
about
mine
is
there
any
sense
in
it
at
all
anywhere
there
must
be
sense
in
it
i
said
we
re
we
re
young
yes
but
one
must
inquire
the
grocer
s
a
grocer
because
i
suppose
he
sees
he
comes
in
there
feels
that
on
the
whole
it
amounts
to
a
call
but
the
bother
is
i
don
t
see
where
i
come
in
at
all
do
you
where
you
come
in
no
where
you
come
not
exactly
yet
i
said
i
want
to
do
some
good
in
the
world
something
something
effectual
before
i
die
i
have
a
sort
of
idea
my
scientific
work
i
don
t
yes
he
mused
and
i
ve
got
a
sort
of
idea
my
sculpture
but
now
it
is
to
come
in
and
why
i
ve
no
idea
at
he
hugged
his
knees
for
a
space
that
s
what
puzzles
me
ponderevo
no
he
became
animated
if
you
will
look
in
that
cupboard
he
said
you
will
find
an
old
respectable
looking
roll
on
a
plate
and
a
knife
somewhere
and
a
gallipot
containing
butter
you
give
them
me
and
i
ll
make
my
breakfast
and
then
if
you
don
t
mind
watching
me
paddle
about
at
my
simple
toilet
i
ll
get
up
then
we
ll
go
for
a
walk
and
talk
about
this
affair
of
life
further
and
about
art
and
literature
and
anything
else
that
crops
up
on
the
way
yes
that
s
the
gallipot
cockroach
got
in
it
chuck
him
out
damned
interloper
so
in
the
first
five
minutes
of
our
talk
as
i
seem
to
remember
it
now
old
ewart
struck
the
note
that
ran
through
all
that
morning
s
intercourse
to
me
it
was
a
most
memorable
talk
because
it
opened
out
quite
new
horizons
of
thought
i
d
been
working
rather
close
and
out
of
touch
with
ewart
s
free
gesticulating
way
he
was
pessimistic
that
day
and
sceptical
to
the
very
root
of
things
he
made
me
feel
clearly
what
i
had
not
felt
at
all
before
the
general
adventurousness
of
life
particularly
of
life
at
the
stage
we
had
reached
and
also
the
absence
of
definite
objects
of
any
concerted
purpose
in
the
lives
that
were
going
on
all
round
us
he
made
me
feel
too
how
ready
i
was
to
take
up
commonplace
assumptions
just
as
i
had
always
imagined
that
somewhere
in
social
arrangements
there
was
certainly
a
who
would
intervene
if
one
went
too
far
so
i
had
always
had
a
sort
of
implicit
belief
that
in
our
england
there
were
somewhere
people
who
understood
what
we
were
all
as
a
nation
about
that
crumpled
into
his
pit
of
doubt
and
vanished
he
brought
out
sharply
cut
and
certain
the
immense
effect
of
purposelessness
in
london
that
i
was
already
indistinctly
feeling
we
found
ourselves
at
last
returning
through
highgate
cemetery
and
waterlow
park
and
ewart
was
talking
look
at
it
there
he
said
stopping
and
pointing
to
the
great
vale
of
london
spreading
wide
and
far
it
s
like
a
sea
and
we
swim
in
it
and
at
last
down
we
go
and
then
up
we
come
washed
up
he
swung
his
arms
to
the
long
slopes
about
us
tombs
and
headstones
in
long
perspectives
in
limitless
rows
we
re
young
ponderevo
but
sooner
or
later
our
whitened
memories
will
wash
up
on
one
of
these
beaches
on
some
such
beach
as
this
george
ponderevo
sidney
ewart
look
at
the
rows
of
em
he
paused
do
you
see
that
hand
the
hand
i
mean
pointing
upward
on
the
top
of
a
blunted
obelisk
yes
well
that
s
what
i
do
for
a
living
when
i
m
not
thinking
or
drinking
or
prowling
or
making
love
or
pretending
i
m
trying
to
be
a
sculptor
without
either
the
money
or
the
morals
for
a
model
see
and
i
do
those
hearts
afire
and
those
pensive
angel
guardians
with
the
palm
of
peace
damned
well
i
do
em
and
damned
cheap
i
m
a
sweated
victim
ponderevo
that
was
the
way
of
it
anyhow
i
drank
deep
of
talk
that
day
we
went
into
theology
into
philosophy
i
had
my
first
glimpse
of
socialism
i
felt
as
though
i
had
been
silent
in
a
silence
since
i
and
he
had
parted
at
the
thought
of
socialism
ewart
s
moods
changed
for
a
time
to
a
sort
of
energy
after
all
all
this
confounded
vagueness
might
be
altered
if
you
could
get
men
to
work
together
it
was
a
good
talk
that
rambled
through
all
the
universe
i
thought
i
was
giving
my
mind
refreshment
but
indeed
it
was
dissipation
all
sorts
of
ideas
even
now
carry
me
back
as
it
were
to
a
to
waterlow
park
and
my
resuscitated
ewart
there
stretches
away
south
of
us
long
garden
slopes
and
white
gravestones
and
the
wide
expanse
of
london
and
somewhere
in
the
picture
is
a
red
old
wall
and
a
great
blaze
of
michaelmas
daisies
set
off
with
late
golden
sunflowers
and
a
drift
of
mottled
fallen
leaves
it
was
with
me
that
day
as
though
i
had
lifted
my
head
suddenly
out
of
dull
and
immediate
things
and
looked
at
life
altogether
but
it
played
the
very
devil
with
the
copying
up
of
my
arrears
of
notes
to
which
i
had
vowed
the
latter
half
of
that
day
after
that
reunion
ewart
and
i
met
much
and
talked
much
and
in
our
subsequent
encounters
his
monologue
was
interrupted
and
i
took
my
share
he
had
exercised
me
so
greatly
that
i
lay
awake
at
nights
thinking
him
over
and
discoursed
and
answered
him
in
my
head
as
i
went
in
the
morning
to
the
college
i
am
by
nature
a
doer
and
only
by
the
way
a
critic
his
philosophical
assertion
of
the
incalculable
vagueness
of
life
which
fitted
his
natural
indolence
roused
my
more
irritable
and
energetic
nature
to
active
protests
it
s
all
so
pointless
i
said
because
people
are
slack
and
because
it
s
in
the
ebb
of
an
age
but
you
re
a
socialist
well
let
s
bring
that
about
and
there
s
a
purpose
there
you
are
ewart
gave
me
all
my
first
conceptions
of
socialism
in
a
little
while
i
was
an
enthusiastic
socialist
and
he
was
a
passive
resister
to
the
practical
exposition
of
the
theories
he
had
taught
me
we
must
join
some
organisation
i
said
we
ought
to
do
things
we
ought
to
go
and
speak
at
street
corners
people
don
t
you
must
figure
me
a
rather
young
man
in
a
state
of
great
earnestness
standing
up
in
that
shabby
studio
of
his
and
saying
these
things
perhaps
with
some
gesticulations
and
ewart
with
a
face
dressed
perhaps
in
a
flannel
shirt
and
trousers
with
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
squatting
philosophically
at
a
table
working
at
some
chunk
of
clay
that
never
got
beyond
suggestion
i
wonder
why
one
doesn
t
want
to
he
said
it
was
only
very
slowly
i
came
to
gauge
ewart
s
real
position
in
the
scheme
of
things
to
understand
how
deliberate
and
complete
was
this
detachment
of
his
from
the
moral
condemnation
and
responsibilities
that
played
so
fine
a
part
in
his
talk
his
was
essentially
the
nature
of
an
artistic
appreciator
he
could
find
interest
and
beauty
in
endless
aspects
of
things
that
i
marked
as
evil
or
at
least
as
not
negotiable
and
the
impulse
i
had
towards
to
sustained
and
consistent
disturbed
and
detached
and
pointless
as
it
was
at
that
time
he
had
indeed
a
sort
of
admiration
for
but
no
sympathy
like
many
fantastic
and
ample
talkers
he
was
at
bottom
secretive
and
he
gave
me
a
series
of
little
shocks
of
discovery
throughout
our
intercourse
the
first
of
these
came
in
the
realisation
that
he
quite
seriously
meant
to
do
nothing
in
the
world
at
all
towards
reforming
the
evils
he
laid
bare
in
so
easy
and
dexterous
a
manner
the
next
came
in
the
sudden
appearance
of
a
person
called
milly
i
ve
forgotten
her
surname
whom
i
found
in
his
room
one
evening
simply
attired
in
a
blue
wrap
the
rest
of
her
costume
behind
the
screen
smoking
cigarettes
and
sharing
a
flagon
of
an
amazingly
cheap
and
grocer
s
wine
ewart
affected
called
canary
hullo
said
ewart
as
i
came
in
this
is
milly
you
know
she
s
been
being
a
model
she
is
a
model
really
keep
calm
ponderevo
have
some
sack
milly
was
a
woman
of
thirty
perhaps
with
a
broad
rather
pretty
face
a
placid
disposition
a
bad
accent
and
delightful
blond
hair
that
waved
off
her
head
with
an
irrepressible
variety
of
charm
and
whenever
ewart
spoke
she
beamed
at
him
ewart
was
always
sketching
this
hair
of
hers
and
embarking
upon
clay
statuettes
of
her
that
were
never
finished
she
was
i
know
now
a
woman
of
the
streets
whom
ewart
had
picked
up
in
the
most
casual
manner
and
who
had
fallen
in
love
with
him
but
my
inexperience
in
those
days
was
too
great
for
me
to
place
her
then
and
ewart
offered
no
elucidations
she
came
to
him
he
went
to
her
they
took
holidays
together
in
the
country
when
certainly
she
sustained
her
fair
share
of
their
expenditure
i
suspect
him
now
even
of
taking
money
from
her
odd
old
ewart
it
was
a
relationship
so
alien
to
my
orderly
conceptions
of
honour
to
what
i
could
imagine
any
friend
of
mine
doing
that
i
really
hardly
saw
it
with
it
there
under
my
nose
but
i
see
it
and
i
think
i
understand
it
now
before
i
fully
grasped
the
discursive
manner
in
which
ewart
was
committed
to
his
particular
way
in
life
i
did
i
say
as
the
broad
constructive
ideas
of
socialism
took
hold
of
me
try
to
get
him
to
work
with
me
in
some
definite
fashion
as
a
socialist
we
ought
to
join
on
to
other
socialists
i
said
they
ve
got
let
s
go
and
look
at
some
after
some
pains
we
discovered
the
office
of
the
fabian
society
lurking
in
a
cellar
in
clement
s
inn
and
we
went
and
interviewed
a
rather
discouraging
secretary
who
stood
astraddle
in
front
of
a
fire
and
questioned
us
severely
and
seemed
to
doubt
the
integrity
of
our
intentions
profoundly
he
advised
us
to
attend
the
next
open
meeting
in
clifford
s
inn
and
gave
us
the
necessary
data
we
both
contrived
to
get
to
the
affair
and
heard
a
discursive
gritty
paper
on
trusts
and
one
of
the
most
inconclusive
discussions
you
can
imagine
of
the
speakers
seemed
under
some
jocular
obsession
which
took
the
form
of
pretending
to
be
conceited
it
was
a
sort
of
family
joke
and
as
strangers
to
the
family
we
did
not
like
it
as
we
came
out
through
the
narrow
passage
from
clifford
s
inn
to
the
strand
ewart
suddenly
pitched
upon
a
wizened
spectacled
little
man
in
a
vast
felt
hat
and
a
large
orange
tie
how
many
members
are
there
in
this
fabian
society
of
yours
he
asked
the
little
man
became
at
once
defensive
in
his
manner
about
seven
hundred
he
said
perhaps
like
like
the
ones
here
the
little
man
gave
a
nervous
laugh
i
suppose
they
re
up
to
sample
he
said
the
little
man
dropped
out
of
existence
and
we
emerged
upon
the
strand
ewart
twisted
his
arm
into
a
queerly
eloquent
gesture
that
gathered
up
all
the
tall
facades
of
the
banks
the
business
places
the
projecting
clock
and
towers
of
the
law
courts
the
advertisements
the
luminous
signs
into
one
social
immensity
into
a
capitalistic
system
gigantic
and
invincible
these
socialists
have
no
sense
of
proportion
he
said
what
can
you
expect
of
them
iv
ewart
as
the
embodiment
of
talk
was
certainly
a
leading
factor
in
my
conspicuous
failure
to
go
on
studying
social
theory
in
its
first
crude
form
of
democratic
socialism
gripped
my
intelligence
more
and
more
powerfully
i
argued
in
the
laboratory
with
the
man
who
shared
my
bench
until
we
quarreled
and
did
not
speak
and
also
i
fell
in
love
the
ferment
of
sex
had
been
creeping
into
my
being
like
a
slowly
advancing
tide
through
all
my
wimblehurst
days
the
stimulus
of
london
was
like
the
rising
of
a
wind
out
of
the
sea
that
brings
the
waves
in
fast
and
high
ewart
had
his
share
in
that
more
and
more
acutely
and
unmistakably
did
my
perception
of
beauty
form
and
sound
my
desire
for
adventure
my
desire
for
intercourse
converge
on
this
central
and
commanding
business
of
the
individual
life
i
had
to
get
me
a
mate
i
began
to
fall
in
love
faintly
with
girls
i
passed
in
the
street
with
women
who
sat
before
me
in
trains
with
girl
with
ladies
in
passing
carriages
with
loiterers
at
the
corners
with
waitresses
in
shops
and
with
pictures
even
of
girls
and
women
on
my
rare
visits
to
the
theatre
i
always
became
exalted
and
found
the
actresses
and
even
the
spectators
about
me
mysterious
attractive
creatures
of
deep
interest
and
desire
i
had
a
stronger
and
stronger
sense
that
among
these
glancing
passing
multitudes
there
was
somewhere
one
who
was
for
me
and
in
spite
of
every
antagonistic
force
in
the
world
there
was
something
in
my
very
marrow
that
insisted
stop
look
at
this
one
think
of
her
won
t
she
do
this
signifies
this
before
all
things
signifies
stop
why
are
you
hurrying
by
this
may
be
the
predestined
person
before
all
it
is
odd
that
i
can
t
remember
when
first
i
saw
marion
who
became
my
wife
whom
i
was
to
make
wretched
who
was
to
make
me
wretched
who
was
to
pluck
that
fine
generalised
possibility
of
love
out
of
my
early
manhood
and
make
it
a
personal
conflict
i
became
aware
of
her
as
one
of
a
number
of
interesting
attractive
figures
that
moved
about
in
my
world
that
glanced
back
at
my
eyes
that
flitted
by
with
a
kind
of
averted
watchfulness
i
would
meet
her
coming
through
the
art
museum
which
was
my
short
cut
to
the
brompton
road
or
see
her
sitting
reading
as
i
thought
in
one
of
the
bays
of
the
education
library
but
really
as
i
found
out
afterwards
she
never
read
she
used
to
come
there
to
eat
a
bun
in
quiet
she
was
a
very
figure
of
a
girl
then
very
plainly
dressed
with
dark
brown
hair
i
remember
in
a
knot
low
on
her
neck
behind
that
confessed
the
pretty
roundness
of
her
head
and
harmonised
with
the
admirable
lines
of
ears
and
cheek
the
grave
serenity
of
mouth
and
brow
she
stood
out
among
the
other
girls
very
distinctly
because
they
dressed
more
than
she
did
struck
emphatic
notes
of
colour
startled
one
by
novelties
in
hats
and
bows
and
things
i
ve
always
hated
the
rustle
the
disconcerting
colour
boundaries
the
smart
unnatural
angles
of
women
s
clothes
her
plain
black
dress
gave
her
a
starkness
i
do
remember
though
how
one
afternoon
i
discovered
the
peculiar
appeal
of
her
form
for
me
i
had
been
restless
with
my
work
and
had
finally
slipped
out
of
the
laboratory
and
come
over
to
the
art
museum
to
lounge
among
the
pictures
i
came
upon
her
in
an
odd
corner
of
the
sheepshanks
gallery
intently
copying
something
from
a
picture
that
hung
high
i
had
just
been
in
the
gallery
of
casts
from
the
antique
my
mind
was
all
alive
with
my
newly
awakened
sense
of
line
and
there
she
stood
with
face
upturned
her
body
drooping
forward
from
the
hips
just
a
little
memorably
graceful
feminine
after
that
i
know
i
sought
to
see
her
felt
a
distinctive
emotion
at
her
presence
began
to
imagine
things
about
her
i
no
longer
thought
of
generalised
womanhood
or
of
this
casual
person
or
that
i
thought
of
her
an
accident
brought
us
together
i
found
myself
one
monday
morning
in
an
omnibus
staggering
westward
from
victoria
i
was
returning
from
a
sunday
i
d
spent
at
wimblehurst
in
response
to
a
unique
freak
of
hospitality
on
the
part
of
mantell
she
was
the
sole
other
inside
passenger
and
when
the
time
came
to
pay
her
fare
she
became
an
extremely
scared
disconcerted
and
fumbling
young
woman
she
had
left
her
purse
at
home
luckily
i
had
some
money
she
looked
at
me
with
startled
troubled
brown
eyes
she
permitted
my
proffered
payment
to
the
conductor
with
a
certain
ungraciousness
that
seemed
a
part
of
her
shyness
and
then
as
she
rose
to
go
she
thanked
me
with
an
obvious
affectation
of
ease
thank
you
so
much
she
said
in
a
pleasant
soft
voice
and
then
less
gracefully
awfully
kind
of
you
you
i
fancy
i
made
polite
noises
but
just
then
i
wasn
t
disposed
to
be
critical
i
was
full
of
the
sense
of
her
presence
her
arm
was
stretched
out
over
me
as
she
moved
past
me
the
gracious
slenderness
of
her
body
was
near
me
the
words
we
used
didn
t
seem
very
greatly
to
matter
i
had
vague
ideas
of
getting
out
with
her
and
i
didn
t
that
encounter
i
have
no
doubt
exercised
me
enormously
i
lay
awake
at
night
rehearsing
it
and
wondering
about
the
next
phase
of
our
relationship
that
took
the
form
of
the
return
of
my
twopence
i
was
in
the
science
library
digging
something
out
of
the
encyclopedia
britannica
when
she
appeared
beside
me
and
placed
on
the
open
page
an
evidently
premeditated
thin
envelope
bulgingly
confessing
the
coins
within
it
was
so
very
kind
of
you
she
said
the
other
day
i
don
t
know
what
i
should
have
done
i
supplied
my
name
i
knew
i
said
you
were
a
student
not
exactly
a
student
i
well
anyhow
i
knew
you
were
here
frequently
and
i
m
a
student
myself
at
the
consolidated
technical
i
plunged
into
autobiography
and
questionings
and
so
entangled
her
in
a
conversation
that
got
a
quality
of
intimacy
through
the
fact
that
out
of
deference
to
our
we
were
obliged
to
speak
in
undertones
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
in
substance
it
was
singularly
banal
indeed
i
have
an
impression
that
all
our
early
conversations
were
incredibly
banal
we
met
several
times
in
a
manner
half
furtive
and
wholly
awkward
mentally
i
didn
t
take
hold
of
her
i
never
did
take
hold
of
her
mentally
her
talk
i
now
know
all
too
clearly
was
shallow
pretentious
evasive
only
even
to
this
day
i
don
t
remember
it
as
in
any
way
vulgar
she
was
i
could
see
quite
clearly
anxious
to
overstate
or
conceal
her
real
social
status
a
little
desirous
to
be
taken
for
a
student
in
the
art
school
and
a
little
ashamed
that
she
wasn
t
she
came
to
the
museum
to
copy
things
and
this
i
gathered
had
something
to
do
with
some
way
of
partially
earning
her
living
that
i
wasn
t
to
inquire
into
i
told
her
things
about
myself
vain
things
that
i
felt
might
appeal
to
her
but
that
i
learnt
long
afterwards
made
her
think
me
we
talked
of
books
but
there
she
was
very
much
on
her
guard
and
secretive
and
rather
more
freely
of
pictures
she
liked
pictures
i
think
from
the
outset
i
appreciated
and
did
not
for
a
moment
resent
that
hers
was
a
commonplace
mind
that
she
was
the
unconscious
custodian
of
something
that
had
gripped
my
most
intimate
instinct
that
she
embodied
the
hope
of
a
possibility
was
the
careless
proprietor
of
a
physical
quality
that
had
turned
my
head
like
strong
wine
i
felt
i
had
to
stick
to
our
acquaintance
flat
as
it
was
presently
we
should
get
through
these
irrelevant
exterior
things
and
come
to
the
reality
of
love
beneath
i
saw
her
in
dreams
released
as
it
were
from
herself
beautiful
worshipful
glowing
and
sometimes
when
we
were
together
we
would
come
on
silences
through
sheer
lack
of
matter
and
then
my
eyes
would
feast
on
her
and
the
silence
seemed
like
the
drawing
back
of
a
curtain
her
superficial
self
odd
i
confess
odd
particularly
the
enormous
hold
of
certain
things
about
her
upon
me
a
certain
slight
rounded
duskiness
of
skin
a
certain
perfection
of
modelling
in
her
lips
her
brow
a
certain
fine
flow
about
the
shoulders
she
wasn
t
indeed
beautiful
to
many
people
these
things
are
beyond
explaining
she
had
manifest
defects
of
form
and
feature
and
they
didn
t
matter
at
all
her
complexion
was
bad
but
i
don
t
think
it
would
have
mattered
if
it
had
been
positively
unwholesome
i
had
extraordinarily
limited
extraordinarily
painful
desires
i
longed
intolerably
to
kiss
her
lips
v
the
affair
was
immensely
serious
and
commanding
to
me
i
don
t
remember
that
in
these
earlier
phases
i
had
any
thought
of
turning
back
at
all
it
was
clear
to
me
that
she
regarded
me
with
an
eye
entirely
more
critical
than
i
had
for
her
that
she
didn
t
like
my
scholarly
untidiness
my
want
of
even
the
most
commonplace
style
why
do
you
wear
collars
like
that
she
said
and
sent
me
in
pursuit
of
gentlemanly
neckwear
i
remember
when
she
invited
me
a
little
abruptly
one
day
to
come
to
tea
at
her
home
on
the
following
sunday
and
meet
her
father
and
mother
and
aunt
that
i
immediately
doubted
whether
my
hitherto
unsuspected
best
clothes
would
create
the
impression
she
desired
me
to
make
on
her
belongings
i
put
off
the
encounter
until
the
sunday
after
to
get
myself
in
order
i
had
a
morning
coat
made
and
i
bought
a
silk
hat
and
had
my
reward
in
the
first
glance
of
admiration
she
ever
gave
me
i
wonder
how
many
of
my
sex
are
as
preposterous
i
was
you
see
abandoning
all
my
beliefs
my
conventions
unasked
i
was
forgetting
myself
immensely
and
there
was
a
conscious
shame
in
it
all
never
a
word
did
i
breathe
to
ewart
to
any
living
soul
of
what
was
going
on
her
father
and
mother
and
aunt
struck
me
as
the
dismalest
of
people
and
her
home
in
walham
green
was
chiefly
notable
for
its
black
and
amber
tapestry
carpets
and
curtains
and
and
the
age
and
irrelevance
of
its
books
mostly
books
with
faded
gilt
on
the
covers
the
windows
were
fortified
against
the
intrusive
eye
by
cheap
lace
curtains
and
an
art
pot
upon
an
unstable
octagonal
table
several
framed
art
school
drawings
of
marion
s
bearing
official
south
kensington
marks
of
approval
adorned
the
room
and
there
was
a
black
and
gilt
piano
with
a
on
the
top
of
it
there
were
draped
mirrors
over
all
the
mantels
and
above
the
sideboard
in
the
in
which
we
sat
at
tea
was
a
portrait
of
her
father
villainously
truthful
after
the
manner
of
such
works
i
couldn
t
see
a
trace
of
the
beauty
i
found
in
her
in
either
parent
yet
she
somehow
contrived
to
be
like
them
both
these
people
pretended
in
a
way
that
reminded
me
of
the
three
great
women
in
my
mother
s
room
but
they
had
not
nearly
so
much
social
knowledge
and
did
not
do
it
nearly
so
well
also
i
remarked
they
did
it
with
an
eye
on
marion
they
had
wanted
to
thank
me
they
said
for
the
kindness
to
their
daughter
in
the
matter
of
the
bus
fare
and
so
accounted
for
anything
unusual
in
their
invitation
they
posed
as
simple
gentlefolk
a
little
hostile
to
the
rush
and
of
london
preferring
a
secluded
and
unpretentious
quiet
when
marion
got
out
the
white
from
the
for
tea
a
card
bearing
the
word
apartments
fell
to
the
floor
i
picked
it
up
and
gave
it
to
her
before
i
realised
from
her
quickened
colour
that
i
should
not
have
seen
it
that
probably
had
been
removed
from
the
window
in
honour
of
my
coming
her
father
spoke
once
in
a
large
remote
way
of
he
claims
of
business
engagements
and
it
was
only
long
afterwards
i
realised
that
he
was
a
supernumerary
clerk
in
the
walham
green
gas
works
and
otherwise
a
useful
man
at
home
he
was
a
large
loose
fattish
man
with
unintelligent
brown
eyes
magnified
by
spectacles
he
wore
an
and
a
paper
collar
and
he
showed
me
as
his
great
treasure
and
interest
a
large
bible
which
he
had
grangerised
with
photographs
of
pictures
also
he
cultivated
the
little
behind
the
house
and
he
had
a
small
greenhouse
with
tomatoes
i
wish
i
ad
eat
he
said
one
can
do
such
a
lot
with
eat
but
i
suppose
you
can
t
ave
everything
you
want
in
this
both
he
and
marion
s
mother
treated
her
with
a
deference
that
struck
me
as
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
her
own
manner
changed
became
more
authoritative
and
watchful
her
shyness
disappeared
she
had
taken
a
line
of
her
own
i
gathered
draped
the
mirror
got
the
piano
and
broken
her
parents
in
her
mother
must
once
have
been
a
pretty
woman
she
had
regular
features
and
marion
s
hair
without
its
lustre
but
she
was
thin
and
careworn
the
aunt
miss
ramboat
was
a
large
abnormally
shy
person
very
like
her
brother
and
i
don
t
recall
anything
she
said
on
this
occasion
to
begin
with
there
was
a
good
deal
of
tension
marion
was
frightfully
nervous
and
every
one
was
under
the
necessity
of
behaving
in
a
mysteriously
unreal
fashion
until
i
plunged
became
talkative
and
made
a
certain
ease
and
interest
i
told
them
of
the
schools
of
my
lodgings
of
wimblehurst
and
my
apprenticeship
days
there
s
a
lot
of
this
science
about
nowadays
ramboat
reflected
but
i
sometimes
wonder
a
bit
what
good
it
is
i
was
young
enough
to
be
led
into
what
he
called
a
bit
of
a
discussion
which
marion
truncated
before
our
voices
became
unduly
raised
i
dare
say
she
said
there
s
much
to
be
said
on
both
i
remember
marion
s
mother
asked
me
what
church
i
attended
and
that
i
replied
evasively
after
tea
there
was
music
and
we
sang
hymns
i
doubted
if
i
had
a
voice
when
this
was
proposed
but
that
was
held
to
be
a
trivial
objection
and
i
found
sitting
close
beside
the
sweep
of
hair
from
marion
s
brow
had
many
compensations
i
discovered
her
mother
sitting
in
the
horsehair
armchair
and
regarding
us
sentimentally
i
went
for
a
walk
with
marion
towards
putney
bridge
and
then
there
was
more
singing
and
a
supper
of
cold
bacon
and
pie
after
which
ramboat
and
i
smoked
during
that
walk
i
remember
she
told
me
the
import
of
her
sketchings
and
copyings
in
the
museum
a
cousin
of
a
friend
of
hers
whom
she
spoke
of
as
smithie
had
developed
an
original
business
in
a
sort
of
garment
which
she
called
a
persian
robe
a
plain
sort
of
wrap
with
a
gaily
embroidered
yoke
and
marion
went
there
and
worked
in
the
busy
times
in
the
times
that
weren
t
busy
she
designed
novelties
in
yokes
by
an
assiduous
use
of
eyes
and
in
the
museum
and
went
home
and
traced
out
the
captured
forms
on
the
foundation
material
i
don
t
get
much
said
marion
but
it
s
interesting
and
in
the
busy
times
we
work
all
day
of
course
the
workgirls
are
dreadfully
common
but
we
don
t
say
much
to
them
and
smithie
talks
enough
for
i
quite
understood
the
workgirls
were
dreadfully
common
i
don
t
remember
that
the
walham
green
menage
and
the
quality
of
these
people
nor
the
light
they
threw
on
marion
detracted
in
the
slightest
degree
at
that
time
from
the
intent
resolve
that
held
me
to
make
her
mine
i
didn
t
like
them
but
i
took
them
as
part
of
the
affair
indeed
on
the
whole
i
think
they
threw
her
up
by
an
effect
of
contrast
she
was
so
obviously
controlling
them
so
consciously
superior
to
them
more
and
more
of
my
time
did
i
give
to
this
passion
that
possessed
me
i
began
to
think
chiefly
of
ways
of
pleasing
marion
of
acts
of
devotion
of
treats
of
sumptuous
presents
for
her
of
appeals
she
would
understand
if
at
times
she
was
manifestly
unintelligent
in
her
ignorance
became
indisputable
i
told
myself
her
simple
instincts
were
worth
all
the
education
and
intelligence
in
the
world
and
to
this
day
i
think
i
wasn
t
really
wrong
about
her
there
was
something
extraordinarily
fine
about
her
something
simple
and
high
that
flickered
in
and
out
of
her
ignorance
and
commonness
and
limitations
like
the
tongue
from
the
mouth
of
a
snake
one
night
i
was
privileged
to
meet
her
and
bring
her
home
from
an
entertainment
at
the
birkbeck
institute
we
came
back
on
the
underground
railway
and
we
travelled
that
being
the
highest
class
available
we
were
alone
in
the
carriage
and
for
the
first
time
i
ventured
to
put
my
arm
about
her
you
mustn
t
she
said
feebly
i
love
you
i
whispered
suddenly
with
my
heart
beating
wildly
drew
her
to
me
drew
all
her
beauty
to
me
and
kissed
her
cool
and
unresisting
lips
love
me
she
said
struggling
away
from
me
don
t
and
then
as
the
train
ran
into
a
station
you
must
tell
no
one
i
don
t
know
you
shouldn
t
have
done
that
then
two
other
people
got
in
with
us
and
terminated
my
wooing
for
a
time
when
we
found
ourselves
alone
together
walking
towards
battersea
she
had
decided
to
be
offended
i
parted
from
her
unforgiven
and
terribly
distressed
when
we
met
again
she
told
me
i
must
never
say
that
again
i
had
dreamt
that
to
kiss
her
lips
was
ultimate
satisfaction
but
it
was
indeed
only
the
beginning
of
desires
i
told
her
my
one
ambition
was
to
marry
her
but
she
said
you
re
not
in
a
position
what
s
the
good
of
talking
like
that
i
stared
at
her
i
mean
to
i
said
you
can
t
she
answered
it
will
be
years
but
i
love
you
i
insisted
i
stood
not
a
yard
from
the
sweet
lips
i
had
kissed
i
stood
within
arm
s
length
of
the
inanimate
beauty
i
desired
to
quicken
and
i
saw
opening
between
us
a
gulf
of
years
toil
waiting
disappointments
and
an
immense
uncertainty
i
love
you
i
said
don
t
you
love
me
she
looked
me
in
the
face
with
grave
irresponsive
eyes
i
don
t
know
she
said
i
like
you
of
course
one
has
to
be
sensibl
i
can
remember
now
my
sense
of
frustration
by
her
unresilient
reply
i
should
have
perceived
then
that
for
her
my
ardour
had
no
quickening
fire
but
how
was
i
to
know
i
had
let
myself
come
to
want
her
my
imagination
endowed
her
with
infinite
possibilities
i
wanted
her
and
wanted
her
stupidly
and
instinctively
but
i
said
love
one
has
to
be
sensible
she
replied
i
like
going
about
with
you
can
t
we
keep
as
we
are
vi
well
you
begin
to
understand
my
breakdown
now
i
have
been
copious
enough
with
these
apologia
my
work
got
more
and
more
spiritless
my
behaviour
degenerated
my
punctuality
declined
i
was
more
and
more
outclassed
in
the
steady
grind
by
my
such
supplies
of
moral
energy
as
i
still
had
at
command
shaped
now
in
the
direction
of
serving
marion
rather
than
science
i
fell
away
dreadfully
more
and
more
i
shirked
and
skulked
the
humped
men
from
the
north
the
pale
men
with
thin
clenched
minds
the
intent
students
i
found
against
me
fell
at
last
from
keen
rivalry
to
moral
contempt
even
a
girl
got
above
me
upon
one
of
the
lists
then
indeed
i
made
it
a
point
of
honour
to
show
by
my
public
disregard
of
every
rule
that
i
really
did
not
even
pretend
to
try
so
one
day
i
found
myself
sitting
in
a
mood
of
considerable
astonishment
in
kensington
gardens
reacting
on
a
recent
heated
interview
with
the
school
registrar
in
which
i
had
displayed
more
spirit
than
sense
i
was
astonished
chiefly
at
my
stupendous
falling
away
from
all
the
militant
ideals
of
unflinching
study
i
had
brought
up
from
wimblehurst
i
had
displayed
myself
as
the
registrar
put
it
an
unmitigated
my
failure
to
get
marks
in
the
written
examination
had
only
been
equalled
by
the
insufficiency
of
my
practical
work
i
ask
you
the
registrar
had
said
what
will
become
of
you
when
your
scholarship
runs
out
it
certainly
was
an
interesting
question
what
was
going
to
become
of
me
it
was
clear
there
would
be
nothing
for
me
in
the
schools
as
i
had
once
dared
to
hope
there
seemed
indeed
scarcely
anything
in
the
world
except
an
illpaid
assistantship
in
some
provincial
organized
science
school
or
grammar
school
i
knew
that
for
that
sort
of
work
without
a
degree
or
any
qualification
one
earned
hardly
a
bare
living
and
had
little
leisure
to
struggle
up
to
anything
better
if
only
i
had
even
as
little
as
fifty
pounds
i
might
hold
out
in
london
and
take
my
degree
and
quadruple
my
chances
my
bitterness
against
my
uncle
returned
at
the
thought
after
all
he
had
some
of
my
money
still
or
ought
to
have
why
shouldn
t
i
act
within
my
rights
threaten
to
take
proceedings
i
meditated
for
a
space
on
the
idea
and
then
returned
to
the
science
library
and
wrote
him
a
very
considerable
and
occasionally
pungent
letter
that
letter
to
my
uncle
was
the
nadir
of
my
failure
its
remarkable
consequences
which
ended
my
student
days
altogether
i
will
tell
in
the
next
chapter
i
say
my
yet
there
are
times
when
i
can
even
doubt
whether
that
period
was
a
failure
at
all
when
i
become
defensively
critical
of
those
exacting
courses
i
did
not
follow
the
encyclopaedic
process
of
scientific
exhaustion
from
which
i
was
distracted
my
mind
was
not
inactive
even
if
it
fed
on
forbidden
food
i
did
not
learn
what
my
professors
and
demonstrators
had
resolved
i
should
learn
but
i
learnt
many
things
my
mind
learnt
to
swing
wide
and
to
swing
by
itself
after
all
those
other
fellows
who
took
high
places
in
the
college
examinations
and
were
the
professor
s
model
boys
haven
t
done
so
amazingly
some
are
professors
themselves
some
technical
experts
not
one
can
show
things
done
such
as
i
following
my
own
interest
have
achieved
for
i
have
built
boats
that
smack
across
the
water
like
whiplashes
no
one
ever
dreamt
of
such
boats
until
i
built
them
and
i
have
surprised
three
secrets
that
are
more
than
technical
discoveries
in
the
unexpected
of
nature
i
have
come
nearer
flying
than
any
man
has
done
could
i
have
done
as
much
if
i
had
had
a
turn
for
obeying
those
rather
mediocre
professors
at
the
college
who
proposed
to
train
my
mind
if
i
had
been
trained
in
research
that
ridiculous
contradiction
in
terms
should
i
have
done
more
than
produce
additions
to
the
existing
store
of
little
papers
with
blunted
conclusions
of
which
there
are
already
too
many
i
see
no
sense
in
mock
modesty
upon
this
matter
even
by
the
standards
of
worldly
success
i
am
by
the
side
of
my
no
failure
i
had
my
by
the
time
i
was
and
if
i
am
not
very
wealthy
poverty
is
as
far
from
me
as
the
spanish
inquisition
suppose
i
had
stamped
down
on
the
head
of
my
wandering
curiosity
locked
my
imagination
in
a
box
just
when
it
wanted
to
grow
out
to
things
worked
by
s
excellent
method
and
s
indications
where
should
i
be
now
i
may
be
all
wrong
in
this
it
may
be
i
should
be
a
far
more
efficient
man
than
i
am
if
i
had
cut
off
all
those
divergent
expenditures
of
energy
plugged
up
my
curiosity
about
society
with
more
currently
acceptable
rubbish
or
other
abandoned
ewart
evaded
marion
instead
of
pursuing
her
concentrated
but
i
don
t
believe
it
however
i
certainly
believed
it
completely
and
was
filled
with
remorse
on
that
afternoon
when
i
sat
dejectedly
in
kensington
gardens
and
reviewed
in
the
light
of
the
registrar
s
pertinent
questions
my
first
two
years
in
london
chapter
the
second
the
dawn
comes
and
my
uncle
appears
in
a
new
silk
hat
i
throughout
my
student
days
i
had
not
seen
my
uncle
i
refrained
from
going
to
him
in
spite
of
an
occasional
regret
that
in
this
way
i
estranged
myself
from
my
aunt
susan
and
i
maintained
a
sulky
attitude
of
mind
towards
him
and
i
don
t
think
that
once
in
all
that
time
i
gave
a
thought
to
that
mystic
word
of
his
that
was
to
alter
all
the
world
for
us
yet
i
had
not
altogether
forgotten
it
it
was
with
a
touch
of
memory
dim
transient
perplexity
if
no
more
why
did
this
thing
seem
in
some
way
personal
that
i
read
a
new
inscription
upon
the
hoardings
the
secret
of
vigour
that
was
all
it
was
simple
and
yet
in
some
way
arresting
i
found
myself
repeating
the
word
after
i
had
passed
it
roused
one
s
attention
like
the
sound
of
distant
guns
tono
what
s
that
and
deep
rich
unhurrying
bun
gay
then
came
my
uncle
s
amazing
telegram
his
answer
to
my
hostile
note
come
to
me
at
once
you
are
wanted
three
hundred
a
year
certain
by
jove
i
cried
of
course
it
s
something
a
i
wonder
what
he
wants
with
in
his
napoleonic
way
my
uncle
had
omitted
to
give
an
address
his
telegram
had
been
handed
in
at
farringdon
road
and
after
complex
meditations
i
replied
to
ponderevo
farringdon
road
trusting
to
the
rarity
of
our
surname
to
reach
him
where
are
you
i
asked
his
reply
came
promptly
raggett
street
the
next
day
i
took
an
unsanctioned
holiday
after
the
morning
s
lecture
i
discovered
my
uncle
in
a
wonderfully
new
silk
hat
oh
a
splendid
hat
with
a
rolling
brim
that
went
beyond
the
common
fashion
it
was
decidedly
too
big
for
him
that
was
its
only
fault
it
was
stuck
on
the
back
of
his
head
and
he
was
in
a
white
waistcoat
and
shirt
sleeves
he
welcomed
me
with
a
forgetfulness
of
my
bitter
satire
and
my
hostile
abstinence
that
was
almost
divine
his
glasses
fell
off
at
the
sight
of
me
his
round
inexpressive
eyes
shone
brightly
he
held
out
his
plump
short
hand
here
we
are
george
what
did
i
tell
you
needn
t
whisper
it
now
my
boy
shout
it
loud
spread
it
about
tell
every
one
tono
tono
raggett
street
you
must
understand
was
a
thoroughfare
over
which
some
one
had
distributed
large
quantities
of
cabbage
stumps
and
leaves
it
opened
out
of
the
upper
end
of
farringdon
street
and
was
a
shop
with
the
front
coloured
chocolate
on
which
several
of
the
same
bills
i
had
read
upon
the
hoardings
had
been
stuck
the
floor
was
covered
by
street
mud
that
had
been
brought
in
on
dirty
boots
and
three
energetic
young
men
of
the
hooligan
type
in
and
caps
were
packing
wooden
cases
with
bottles
amidst
much
straw
and
confusion
the
counter
was
littered
with
these
same
swathed
bottles
of
a
pattern
then
novel
but
now
amazingly
familiar
in
the
world
the
blue
paper
with
the
coruscating
figure
of
a
genially
nude
giant
and
the
printed
directions
of
how
under
practically
all
circumstances
to
take
beyond
the
counter
on
one
side
opened
a
staircase
down
which
i
seem
to
remember
a
girl
descending
with
a
further
consignment
of
bottles
and
the
rest
of
the
background
was
a
high
partition
also
chocolate
with
temporary
laboratory
inscribed
upon
it
in
white
letters
and
over
a
door
that
pierced
it
here
i
rapped
inaudible
amid
much
hammering
and
then
entered
unanswered
to
find
my
uncle
dressed
as
i
have
described
one
hand
gripping
a
sheath
of
letters
and
the
other
scratching
his
head
as
he
dictated
to
one
of
three
toiling
typewriter
girls
behind
him
was
a
further
partition
and
a
door
inscribed
absolutely
private
no
admission
thereon
this
partition
was
of
wood
painted
the
universal
chocolate
up
to
about
eight
feet
from
the
ground
and
then
of
glass
through
the
glass
i
saw
dimly
a
crowded
suggestion
of
crucibles
and
glass
retorts
and
by
jove
yes
the
dear
old
wimblehurst
still
it
gave
me
quite
a
little
thrill
that
and
beside
it
was
the
electrical
machine
but
something
some
serious
trouble
had
happened
to
that
all
these
were
evidently
placed
on
a
shelf
just
at
the
level
to
show
come
right
into
the
sanctum
said
my
uncle
after
he
had
finished
something
about
esteemed
consideration
and
whisked
me
through
the
door
into
a
room
that
quite
amazingly
failed
to
verify
the
promise
of
that
apparatus
it
was
papered
with
dingy
that
had
peeled
in
places
it
contained
a
fireplace
an
with
a
cushion
a
table
on
which
stood
two
or
three
big
bottles
a
number
of
on
the
mantel
whisky
tantalus
and
a
row
of
soda
syphons
he
shut
the
door
after
me
carefully
well
here
we
are
he
said
going
strong
have
a
whisky
george
no
wise
man
neither
will
i
you
see
me
at
it
at
it
hard
hard
at
what
read
it
and
he
thrust
into
my
hand
a
label
that
label
that
has
now
become
one
of
the
most
familiar
objects
of
the
chemist
s
shop
the
rather
bordering
the
legend
the
name
in
good
black
type
very
clear
and
the
strong
man
all
set
about
with
lightning
flashes
above
the
double
column
of
skilful
lies
in
red
the
label
of
it
s
afloat
he
said
as
i
stood
puzzling
at
this
it
s
afloat
i
m
afloat
and
suddenly
he
burst
out
singing
in
that
throaty
tenor
of
his
i
m
afloat
i
m
afloat
on
the
fierce
flowing
tide
the
ocean
s
my
home
and
my
bark
is
my
bride
ripping
song
that
is
george
not
so
much
a
bark
as
a
solution
but
still
it
does
here
we
are
at
it
half
a
mo
i
ve
thought
of
a
he
whisked
out
leaving
me
to
examine
this
nuclear
spot
at
leisure
while
his
voice
became
dictatorial
without
the
den
struck
me
as
in
its
large
grey
dirty
way
quite
unprecedented
and
extraordinary
the
bottles
were
all
labelled
simply
a
b
c
and
so
forth
and
that
dear
old
apparatus
above
seen
from
this
side
was
even
more
patiently
on
the
shelf
than
when
it
had
been
used
to
impress
wimblehurst
i
saw
nothing
for
it
but
to
sit
down
in
the
chair
and
await
my
uncle
s
explanations
i
remarked
a
with
satin
lapels
behind
the
door
there
was
a
dignified
umbrella
in
the
corner
and
a
and
a
stood
on
a
my
uncle
returned
in
five
minutes
looking
at
his
watch
a
gold
watch
gettin
george
he
said
you
d
better
come
and
have
lunch
with
me
how
s
aunt
susan
i
asked
exuberant
never
saw
her
so
larky
this
has
bucked
her
up
something
wonderful
all
all
what
what
is
i
asked
my
uncle
hesitated
tell
you
after
lunch
george
he
said
come
along
and
having
locked
up
the
sanctum
after
himself
led
the
way
along
a
narrow
dirty
pavement
lined
with
barrows
and
swept
at
times
by
porters
bearing
burthens
to
vans
to
farringdon
street
he
hailed
a
passing
cab
superbly
and
the
cabman
was
infinitely
respectful
schafer
s
he
said
and
off
we
went
side
by
side
and
with
me
more
and
more
amazed
at
all
these
things
to
schafer
s
hotel
the
second
of
the
two
big
places
with
huge
lace
windows
near
the
corner
of
blackfriars
bridge
i
will
confess
i
felt
a
magic
charm
in
our
relative
proportions
as
the
two
colossal
liveried
porters
of
schafers
held
open
the
inner
doors
for
us
with
a
respectful
salutation
that
in
some
manner
they
seemed
to
confine
wholly
to
my
uncle
instead
of
being
about
four
inches
taller
i
felt
at
least
the
same
size
as
he
and
very
much
slenderer
still
more
respectful
waiters
relieved
him
of
the
new
hat
and
the
dignified
umbrella
and
took
his
orders
for
our
lunch
he
gave
them
with
a
fine
assurance
he
nodded
to
several
of
the
waiters
they
know
me
george
already
he
said
point
me
out
live
place
eye
for
coming
men
the
detailed
business
of
the
lunch
engaged
our
attention
for
a
while
and
then
i
leant
across
my
plate
and
now
said
i
it
s
the
secret
of
vigour
didn
t
you
read
that
label
yes
but
it
s
selling
like
hot
and
what
is
it
i
pressed
well
said
my
uncle
and
then
leant
forward
and
spoke
softly
under
cover
of
his
hand
it
s
nothing
more
or
less
than
but
here
an
unfortunate
scruple
intervenes
after
all
is
still
a
marketable
commodity
and
in
the
hands
of
purchasers
who
bought
it
from
among
other
vendors
me
no
i
am
afraid
i
can
not
give
it
away
you
see
said
my
uncle
in
a
slow
confidential
whisper
with
eyes
very
wide
and
a
creased
forehead
it
s
nice
because
of
the
here
he
mentioned
a
flavouring
matter
and
an
aromatic
spirit
it
s
stimulating
because
of
here
he
mentioned
two
very
vivid
tonics
one
with
a
marked
action
on
the
kidney
and
the
here
he
mentioned
two
other
ingredients
makes
it
pretty
intoxicating
cocks
their
tails
then
there
s
but
i
touch
on
the
essential
secret
and
there
you
are
i
got
it
out
of
an
old
book
of
recipes
all
except
the
here
he
mentioned
the
more
virulent
substance
the
one
that
assails
the
kidneys
which
is
my
idea
modern
touch
there
you
are
he
reverted
to
the
direction
of
our
lunch
presently
he
was
leading
the
way
to
the
lounge
sumptuous
piece
in
red
morocco
and
yellow
glazed
crockery
with
incredible
vistas
of
settees
and
sofas
and
things
and
there
i
found
myself
grouped
with
him
in
two
excessively
upholstered
chairs
with
an
earthenware
moorish
table
between
us
bearing
coffee
and
benedictine
and
i
was
tasting
the
delights
of
a
tenpenny
cigar
my
uncle
smoked
a
similar
cigar
in
an
habituated
manner
and
he
looked
energetic
and
knowing
and
luxurious
and
most
unexpectedly
a
little
bounder
round
the
end
of
it
it
was
just
a
trivial
flaw
upon
our
swagger
perhaps
that
we
both
were
clear
our
cigars
had
to
be
he
got
obliquely
across
the
spaces
of
his
great
armchair
so
as
to
incline
confidentially
to
my
ear
he
curled
up
his
little
legs
and
i
in
my
longer
way
adopted
a
corresponding
receptive
obliquity
i
felt
that
we
should
strike
an
unbiased
observer
as
a
couple
of
very
deep
and
wily
and
developing
and
repulsive
persons
i
want
to
let
you
into
this
puff
george
said
my
uncle
round
the
end
of
his
cigar
for
many
his
voice
grew
lower
and
more
cunning
he
made
explanations
that
to
my
inexperience
did
not
completely
explain
i
retain
an
impression
of
a
long
credit
and
a
share
with
a
firm
of
wholesale
chemists
of
a
credit
and
a
prospective
share
with
some
pirate
printers
of
a
third
share
for
a
leading
magazine
and
newspaper
proprietor
i
played
em
off
one
against
the
other
said
my
uncle
i
took
his
point
in
an
instant
he
had
gone
to
each
of
them
in
turn
and
said
the
others
had
come
in
i
put
up
four
hundred
pounds
said
my
uncle
myself
and
my
all
and
you
know
he
assumed
a
brisk
confidence
i
hadn
t
five
hundred
pence
at
least
for
a
moment
he
really
was
just
a
little
embarrassed
i
did
he
said
produce
capital
you
see
there
was
that
trust
affair
of
yours
i
ought
i
suppose
in
strict
legality
to
have
put
that
straight
first
zzzz
it
was
a
bold
thing
to
do
said
my
uncle
shifting
the
venue
from
the
region
of
honour
to
the
region
of
courage
and
then
with
a
characteristic
outburst
of
piety
thank
god
it
s
all
come
right
and
now
i
suppose
you
ask
where
do
you
come
in
well
fact
is
i
ve
always
believed
in
you
george
you
ve
got
it
s
a
sort
of
dismal
grit
bark
your
shins
rouse
you
and
you
ll
go
you
d
rush
any
position
you
had
a
mind
to
rush
i
know
a
bit
about
character
george
trust
me
you
ve
got
he
clenched
his
hands
and
thrust
them
out
suddenly
and
at
the
same
time
said
with
explosive
violence
wooosh
yes
you
have
the
way
you
put
away
that
latin
at
wimblehurst
i
ve
never
forgotten
it
your
science
and
all
that
i
know
my
limitations
there
s
things
i
can
do
and
he
spoke
in
a
whisper
as
though
this
was
the
first
hint
of
his
life
s
secret
there
s
things
i
can
t
well
i
can
create
this
business
but
i
can
t
make
it
go
i
m
too
voluminous
i
m
a
not
a
simmering
you
keep
on
hotting
up
and
hotting
up
papin
s
digester
that
s
you
steady
and
long
and
piling
up
then
come
in
and
stiffen
these
niggers
teach
them
that
there
you
are
that
s
what
i
m
after
you
nobody
else
believes
you
re
more
than
a
boy
come
right
in
with
me
and
be
a
man
eh
george
think
of
the
fun
of
it
a
thing
on
the
go
a
real
live
thing
wooshing
it
up
making
it
buzz
and
spin
he
made
alluring
expanding
circles
in
the
air
with
his
hand
eh
his
proposal
sinking
to
confidential
undertones
again
took
more
definite
shape
i
was
to
give
all
my
time
and
energy
to
developing
and
organising
you
shan
t
write
a
single
advertisement
or
give
a
single
assurance
he
declared
i
can
do
all
and
the
telegram
was
no
flourish
i
was
to
have
three
hundred
a
year
three
hundred
a
year
that
s
nothing
said
my
uncle
the
thing
to
freeze
on
to
when
the
time
comes
is
your
tenth
of
the
vendor
s
three
hundred
a
year
certain
anyhow
it
was
an
enormous
income
to
me
for
a
moment
i
was
altogether
staggered
could
there
be
that
much
money
in
the
whole
concern
i
looked
about
me
at
the
sumptuous
furniture
of
schafer
s
hotel
no
doubt
there
were
many
such
incomes
my
head
was
spinning
with
unwonted
benedictine
and
burgundy
let
me
go
back
and
look
at
the
game
again
i
said
let
me
see
upstairs
and
round
i
did
what
do
you
think
of
it
all
my
uncle
asked
at
last
well
for
one
thing
i
said
why
don
t
you
have
those
girls
working
in
a
decently
ventilated
room
apart
from
any
other
consideration
they
d
work
twice
as
briskly
and
they
ought
to
cover
the
corks
before
labelling
round
the
why
said
my
uncle
because
they
sometimes
make
a
mucker
of
the
cork
job
and
then
the
label
s
come
and
change
it
george
said
my
uncle
with
sudden
fervour
come
here
and
make
a
machine
of
it
you
can
make
it
all
slick
and
then
make
it
woosh
i
know
you
can
oh
i
know
you
ii
i
seem
to
remember
very
quick
changes
of
mind
after
that
lunch
the
muzzy
exaltation
of
the
unaccustomed
stimulants
gave
way
very
rapidly
to
a
model
of
pellucid
and
impartial
clairvoyance
which
is
one
of
my
habitual
mental
states
it
is
intermittent
it
leaves
me
for
weeks
together
i
know
but
back
it
comes
at
last
like
justice
on
circuit
and
calls
up
all
my
impression
all
my
illusions
all
my
willful
and
passionate
proceedings
we
came
downstairs
again
into
that
inner
room
which
pretended
to
be
a
scientific
laboratory
through
its
high
glass
lights
and
indeed
was
a
lurking
place
my
uncle
pressed
a
cigarette
on
me
and
i
took
it
and
stood
before
the
empty
fireplace
while
he
propped
his
umbrella
in
the
corner
deposited
the
new
silk
hat
that
was
a
little
too
big
for
him
on
the
table
blew
copiously
and
produced
a
second
cigar
it
came
into
my
head
that
he
had
shrunken
very
much
in
size
since
the
wimblehurst
days
that
the
cannon
ball
he
had
swallowed
was
rather
more
evident
and
shameless
than
it
had
been
his
skin
less
fresh
and
the
nose
between
his
glasses
which
still
didn
t
quite
fit
much
redder
and
just
then
he
seemed
much
laxer
in
his
muscles
and
not
quite
as
alertly
quick
in
his
movements
but
he
evidently
wasn
t
aware
of
the
degenerative
nature
of
his
changes
as
he
sat
there
looking
suddenly
quite
little
under
my
eyes
well
george
he
said
quite
happily
unconscious
of
my
silent
criticism
what
do
you
think
of
it
all
well
i
said
in
the
first
place
it
s
a
damned
swindle
tut
tut
said
my
uncle
it
s
as
straight
as
it
s
fair
trading
so
much
the
worse
for
trading
i
said
it
s
the
sort
of
thing
everybody
does
after
all
there
s
no
harm
in
the
stuff
and
it
may
do
good
it
might
do
a
lot
of
good
giving
people
confidence
f
rinstance
against
an
epidemic
see
why
not
don
t
see
where
your
swindle
comes
h
m
i
said
it
s
a
thing
you
either
see
or
don
t
i
d
like
to
know
what
sort
of
trading
isn
t
a
swindle
in
its
way
everybody
who
does
a
large
advertised
trade
is
selling
something
common
on
the
strength
of
saying
it
s
uncommon
look
at
chickson
they
made
him
a
baronet
look
at
lord
radmore
who
did
it
on
lying
about
the
alkali
in
soap
rippin
ads
those
were
of
his
too
you
don
t
mean
to
say
you
think
doing
this
stuff
up
in
bottles
and
swearing
it
s
the
quintessence
of
strength
and
making
poor
devils
buy
it
at
that
is
straight
why
not
george
how
do
we
know
it
mayn
t
be
the
quintessence
to
them
so
far
as
they
re
concerned
oh
i
said
and
shrugged
my
shoulders
there
s
faith
you
put
faith
in
em
i
grant
our
labels
are
a
bit
emphatic
christian
science
really
no
good
setting
people
against
the
medicine
tell
me
a
solitary
trade
nowadays
that
hasn
t
to
be
emphatic
it
s
the
modern
way
everybody
understands
it
everybody
allows
for
but
the
world
would
be
no
worse
and
rather
better
if
all
this
stuff
of
yours
was
run
down
a
conduit
into
the
don
t
see
that
george
at
all
mong
other
things
all
our
people
would
be
out
of
work
unemployed
i
grant
you
may
be
not
quite
so
good
a
find
for
the
world
as
peruvian
bark
but
the
point
is
george
it
makes
trade
and
the
world
lives
on
trade
commerce
a
romantic
exchange
of
commodities
and
property
romance
magination
see
you
must
look
at
these
things
in
a
broad
light
look
at
the
wood
and

do
go

chemist
to
some
one
who
is
running
a
business
and
draw
a
salary
without
a
share
like
i
offer
you
much
sense

george

re
behind

times
the
last
of
that
sort
was
sold
up
bout
five
years

there

scientific
and
who
pays
for
that
who
put
up
that
big
city
and
guilds
place
at
south
kensington
enterprising
business
men
they
fancy
they
ll
have
a
bit
of
science
going
on
they
want
a
handy
expert
ever
and
again
and
there
you
are
and
what
do
you
get
for
research
when
you
ve
done
it
just
a
bare
living
and

lord
what
a
book
that
french
revolution
of
his
is

world
pays
teachers
and
discoverers
and
what
it
pays
business
men
that
shows
the
ones
it
really
wants
there
s
a
justice
in
these
big
things
george
over
and
above
the
apparent
injustice
i
tell
you
it
wants
trade
it
s
trade
that
makes
the
world
go
round
argosies
venice
empire
my
uncle
suddenly
rose
to
his
feet
you
think
it
over
george
you
think
it
over
and
come
up
on
sunday
to
the
new
place
we
got
rooms
in
gower
street
now
and
see
your
aunt
she
s
often
asked
for
you
george
often
and
often
and
thrown
it
up
at
me
about
that
bit
of
property
though
i
ve
always
said
and
always
will
that
shillings
in
the
pound
is
what
i
ll
pay
you
and
interest
up
to
the
nail
and
think
it
over
it
isn
t
me
i
ask
you
to
help
it
s
yourself
it
s
your
aunt
susan
it
s
the
whole
concern
it
s
the
commerce
of
your
country
and
we
want
you
badly
i
tell
you
straight
i
know
my
limitations
you
could
take
this
place
you
could
make
it
go
i
can
see
you
at
it
looking
rather
sour
woosh
is
the
word
and
he
smiled
endearingly
i
got
to
dictate
a
letter
he
said
ending
the
smile
and
vanished
into
the
outer
room
iii
i
didn
t
succumb
without
a
struggle
to
my
uncle
s
allurements
indeed
i
held
out
for
a
week
while
i
contemplated
life
and
my
prospects
it
was
a
crowded
and
muddled
contemplation
it
invaded
even
my
sleep
my
interview
with
the
registrar
my
talk
with
my
uncle
my
abrupt
discovery
of
the
hopeless
futility
of
my
passion
for
marion
had
combined
to
bring
me
to
sense
of
crisis
what
was
i
going
to
do
with
life
i
remember
certain
phases
of
my
indecisions
very
well
i
remember
going
home
from
our
talk
i
went
down
farringdon
street
to
the
embankment
because
i
thought
to
go
home
by
holborn
and
oxford
street
would
be
too
crowded
for
thinking
that
piece
of
embankment
from
blackfriars
to
westminster
still
reminds
me
of
that
momentous
hesitation
you
know
from
first
to
last
i
saw
the
business
with
my
eyes
open
i
saw
its
ethical
and
moral
values
quite
clearly
never
for
a
moment
do
i
remember
myself
faltering
from
my
persuasion
that
the
sale
of
was
a
thoroughly
dishonest
proceeding
the
stuff
was
i
perceived
a
mischievous
trash
slightly
stimulating
aromatic
and
attractive
likely
to
become
a
bad
habit
and
train
people
in
the
habitual
use
of
stronger
tonics
and
insidiously
dangerous
to
people
with
defective
kidneys
it
would
cost
about
sevenpence
the
large
bottle
to
make
including
bottling
and
we
were
to
sell
it
at
half
a
crown
plus
the
cost
of
the
patent
medicine
stamp
a
thing
that
i
will
confess
deterred
me
from
the
outset
far
more
than
the
sense
of
dishonesty
in
this
affair
was
the
supreme
silliness
of
the
whole
concern
i
still
clung
to
the
idea
that
the
world
of
men
was
or
should
be
a
sane
and
just
organisation
and
the
idea
that
i
should
set
myself
gravely
just
at
the
fine
springtime
of
my
life
to
developing
a
monstrous
bottling
and
packing
warehouse
bottling
rubbish
for
the
consumption
of
foolish
credulous
and
depressed
people
had
in
it
a
touch
of
insanity
my
early
beliefs
still
clung
to
me
i
felt
assured
that
somewhere
there
must
be
a
hitch
in
the
fine
prospect
of
ease
and
wealth
under
such
conditions
that
somewhere
a
little
overgrown
perhaps
but
still
traceable
lay
a
neglected
wasted
path
of
use
and
honour
for
me
my
inclination
to
refuse
the
whole
thing
increased
rather
than
diminished
at
first
as
i
went
along
the
embankment
in
my
uncle
s
presence
there
had
been
a
sort
of
glamour
that
had
prevented
an
outright
refusal
it
was
a
revival
of
affection
for
him
i
felt
in
his
presence
i
think
in
part
and
in
part
an
instinctive
feeling
that
i
must
consider
him
as
my
host
but
much
more
was
it
a
curious
persuasion
he
had
the
knack
of
inspiring
a
persuasion
not
so
much
of
his
integrity
and
capacity
as
of
the
reciprocal
and
yielding
foolishness
of
the
world
one
felt
that
he
was
silly
and
wild
but
in
some
way
silly
and
wild
after
the
fashion
of
the
universe
after
all
one
must
live
somehow
i
astonished
him
and
myself
by
temporising
no
said
i
i
ll
think
it
over
and
as
i
went
along
the
embankment
the
first
effect
was
all
against
my
uncle
he
shrank
for
a
little
while
he
continued
to
shrink
in
perspective
until
he
was
only
a
very
small
shabby
little
man
in
a
dirty
back
street
sending
off
a
few
hundred
bottles
of
rubbish
to
foolish
buyers
the
great
buildings
on
the
right
of
us
the
inns
and
the
school
board
place
as
it
was
then
somerset
house
the
big
hotels
the
great
bridges
westminster
s
outlines
ahead
had
an
effect
of
grey
largeness
that
reduced
him
to
the
proportions
of
a
busy
black
beetle
in
a
crack
in
the
floor
and
then
my
eye
caught
the
advertisements
on
the
south
side
of
sorber
s
food
of
cracknell
s
ferric
wine
very
bright
and
prosperous
signs
illuminated
at
night
and
i
realised
how
astonishingly
they
looked
at
home
there
how
evidently
part
they
were
in
the
whole
thing
i
saw
a
man
come
charging
out
of
palace
yard
the
policeman
touched
his
helmet
to
him
with
a
hat
and
a
bearing
astonishingly
like
my
uncle
s
after
all
didn
t
cracknell
himself
sit
in
the
house
shouted
at
me
from
a
hoarding
near
adelphi
terrace
i
saw
it
afar
off
near
carfax
street
it
cried
out
again
upon
me
in
kensington
high
street
and
burst
into
a
perfect
clamour
six
or
seven
times
i
saw
it
as
i
drew
near
my
diggings
it
certainly
had
an
air
of
being
something
more
than
a
dream
yes
i
thought
it
over
thoroughly
enough
trade
rules
the
world
wealth
rather
than
trade
the
thing
was
true
and
true
too
was
my
uncle
s
proposition
that
the
quickest
way
to
get
wealth
is
to
sell
the
cheapest
thing
possible
in
the
dearest
bottle
he
was
frightfully
right
after
all
pecunnia
non
olet
a
roman
emperor
said
that
perhaps
my
great
heroes
in
plutarch
were
no
more
than
such
men
fine
now
only
because
they
are
distant
perhaps
after
all
this
socialism
to
which
i
had
been
drawn
was
only
a
foolish
dream
only
the
more
foolish
because
all
its
promises
were
conditionally
true
morris
and
these
others
played
with
it
wittingly
it
gave
a
zest
a
touch
of
substance
to
their
aesthetic
pleasures
never
would
there
be
good
faith
enough
to
bring
such
things
about
they
knew
it
every
one
except
a
few
young
fools
knew
it
as
i
crossed
the
corner
of
james
s
park
wrapped
in
thought
i
dodged
back
just
in
time
to
escape
a
prancing
pair
of
greys
a
stout
woman
very
magnificently
dressed
regarded
me
from
the
carriage
with
a
scornful
eye
no
doubt
thought
i
a
s
wife
running
through
all
my
thoughts
surging
out
like
a
refrain
was
my
uncle
s
his
admirable
touch
of
praise
make
it
all
slick
and
then
make
it
go
woosh
i
know
you
can
oh
i
know
you
can
iv
ewart
as
a
moral
influence
was
unsatisfactory
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
put
the
whole
thing
before
him
partly
to
see
how
he
took
it
and
partly
to
hear
how
it
sounded
when
it
was
said
i
asked
him
to
come
and
eat
with
me
in
an
italian
place
near
panton
street
where
one
could
get
a
curious
interesting
glutting
sort
of
dinner
for
he
came
with
a
disconcerting
that
he
wouldn
t
explain
not
so
much
a
he
said
as
the
aftermath
of
a
purple
patch
what
s
your
difficulty
i
ll
tell
you
with
the
salad
i
said
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
didn
t
tell
him
i
threw
out
that
i
was
doubtful
whether
i
ought
to
go
into
trade
or
stick
to
teaching
in
view
of
my
deepening
socialist
proclivities
and
he
warming
with
the
unaccustomed
generosity
of
a
chianti
ran
on
from
that
without
any
further
inquiry
as
to
my
trouble
his
utterances
roved
wide
and
loose
the
reality
of
life
my
dear
ponderevo
i
remember
him
saying
very
impressively
and
punctuating
with
the
as
he
spoke
is
chromatic
conflict
and
form
get
hold
of
that
and
let
all
these
other
questions
go
the
socialist
will
tell
you
one
sort
of
colour
and
shape
is
right
the
individualist
another
what
does
it
all
amount
to
what
does
it
all
amount
to
nothing
i
have
no
advice
to
give
anyone
except
to
avoid
regrets
be
yourself
seek
after
such
beautiful
things
as
your
own
sense
determines
to
be
beautiful
and
don
t
mind
the
headache
in
the
morning
for
what
after
all
is
a
morning
ponderevo
it
isn
t
like
the
upper
part
of
a
day
he
paused
impressively
what
rot
i
cried
after
a
confused
attempt
to
apprehend
him
isn
t
it
and
it
s
my
bedrock
wisdom
in
the
matter
take
it
or
leave
it
my
dear
george
take
it
or
leave
he
put
down
the
out
of
my
reach
and
lugged
a
from
his
pocket
i
m
going
to
steal
this
mustard
pot
he
said
i
made
noises
of
remonstrance
only
as
a
matter
of
design
i
ve
got
to
do
an
old
beast
s
tomb
wholesale
grocer
i
ll
put
it
on
his
corners
four
mustard
pots
i
dare
say
he
d
be
glad
of
a
mustard
plaster
now
to
cool
him
poor
devil
where
he
is
but
anyhow
here
goes
v
it
came
to
me
in
the
small
hours
that
the
real
moral
touchstone
for
this
great
doubting
of
mind
was
marion
i
lay
composing
statements
of
my
problem
and
imagined
myself
delivering
them
to
her
and
she
and
beautiful
giving
her
fine
judgment
you
see
it
s
just
to
give
one
s
self
over
to
the
capitalistic
system
i
imagined
myself
saying
in
good
socialist
jargon
it
s
surrendering
all
one
s
beliefs
we
may
succeed
we
may
grow
rich
but
where
would
the
satisfaction
be
then
she
would
say
no
that
wouldn
t
be
but
the
alternative
is
to
wait
then
suddenly
she
would
become
a
goddess
she
would
turn
upon
me
frankly
and
nobly
with
shining
eyes
with
arms
held
out
no
she
would
say
we
love
one
another
nothing
ignoble
shall
ever
touch
us
we
love
one
another
why
wait
to
tell
each
other
that
dear
what
does
it
matter
that
we
are
poor
and
may
keep
poor
but
indeed
the
conversation
didn
t
go
at
all
in
that
direction
at
the
sight
of
her
my
nocturnal
eloquence
became
preposterous
and
all
the
moral
values
altered
altogether
i
had
waited
for
her
outside
the
door
of
the
establishment
in
kensington
high
street
and
walked
home
with
her
thence
i
remember
how
she
emerged
into
the
warm
evening
light
and
that
she
wore
a
brown
straw
hat
that
made
her
for
once
not
only
beautiful
but
pretty
i
like
that
hat
i
said
by
way
of
opening
and
she
smiled
her
rare
delightful
smile
at
me
i
love
you
i
said
in
an
undertone
as
we
jostled
closer
on
the
pavement
she
shook
her
head
forbiddingly
but
she
still
smiled
then
be
sensible
the
high
street
pavement
is
too
narrow
and
crowded
for
conversation
and
we
were
some
way
westward
before
we
spoke
again
look
here
i
said
i
want
you
marion
don
t
you
understand
i
want
now
she
cried
warningly
i
do
not
know
if
the
reader
will
understand
how
a
passionate
lover
an
immense
admiration
and
desire
can
be
shot
with
a
gleam
of
positive
hatred
such
a
gleam
there
was
in
me
at
the
serene
of
that
now
it
vanished
almost
before
i
felt
it
i
found
no
warning
in
it
of
the
antagonisms
latent
between
us
marion
i
said
this
isn
t
a
trifling
matter
to
me
i
love
you
i
would
die
to
get
you
don
t
you
care
but
what
is
the
good
you
don
t
care
i
cried
you
don
t
care
a
rap
you
know
i
care
she
answered
if
i
didn
t
if
i
didn
t
like
you
very
much
should
i
let
you
come
and
meet
me
go
about
with
you
well
then
i
said
promise
to
marry
me
if
i
do
what
difference
will
it
make
we
were
separated
by
two
men
carrying
a
ladder
who
drove
between
us
unawares
marion
i
asked
when
we
got
together
again
i
tell
you
i
want
you
to
marry
we
can
why
not
we
can
t
marry
in
the
we
could
take
our
chance
i
wish
you
wouldn
t
go
on
talking
like
this
what
is
the
good
she
suddenly
gave
way
to
gloom
it
s
no
good
marrying
she
said
one
s
only
miserable
i
ve
seen
other
girls
when
one
s
alone
one
has
a
little
anyhow
one
can
go
about
a
little
but
think
of
being
married
and
no
money
and
perhaps
children
you
can
t
be
sure
she
poured
out
this
concentrated
philosophy
of
her
class
and
type
in
jerky
uncompleted
sentences
with
knitted
brows
with
discontented
eyes
towards
the
westward
glow
forgetful
it
seemed
for
a
moment
even
of
me
look
here
marion
i
said
abruptly
what
would
you
marry
on
what
is
the
good
she
began
would
you
marry
on
three
hundred
a
year
she
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
that
s
six
pounds
a
week
she
said
one
could
manage
on
that
easily
smithie
s
brother
no
he
only
gets
two
hundred
and
fifty
he
married
a
typewriting
will
you
marry
me
if
i
get
three
hundred
a
year
she
looked
at
me
again
with
a
curious
gleam
of
hope
if
she
said
i
held
out
my
hand
and
looked
her
in
the
eyes
it
s
a
bargain
i
said
she
hesitated
and
touched
my
hand
for
an
instant
it
s
silly
she
remarked
as
she
did
so
it
means
really
we
re
she
paused
yes
said
i
engaged
you
ll
have
to
wait
years
what
good
can
it
do
you
not
so
many
i
answered
for
a
moment
she
brooded
then
she
glanced
at
me
with
a
smile
that
has
stuck
in
my
memory
for
ever
i
like
you
she
said
i
shall
like
to
be
engaged
to
and
faint
on
the
threshold
of
hearing
i
caught
her
ventured
dear
it
s
odd
that
in
writing
this
down
my
memory
passed
over
all
that
intervened
and
i
feel
it
all
again
and
once
again
i
m
marion
s
boyish
lover
taking
great
joy
in
such
rare
and
little
things
vi
at
last
i
went
to
the
address
my
uncle
had
given
me
in
gower
street
and
found
my
aunt
susan
waiting
tea
for
him
directly
i
came
into
the
room
i
appreciated
the
change
in
outlook
that
the
achievement
of
had
made
almost
as
vividly
as
when
i
saw
my
uncle
s
new
hat
the
furniture
of
the
room
struck
upon
my
eye
as
almost
stately
the
chairs
and
sofa
were
covered
with
chintz
which
gave
it
a
dim
remote
flavour
of
bladesover
the
mantel
the
cornice
the
gas
pendant
were
larger
and
finer
than
the
sort
of
thing
i
had
grown
accustomed
to
in
london
and
i
was
shown
in
by
a
real
housemaid
with
real
tails
to
her
cap
and
great
quantities
of
reddish
hair
there
was
my
aunt
too
looking
bright
and
pretty
in
a
with
bows
that
seemed
to
me
the
quintessence
of
fashion
she
was
sitting
in
a
chair
by
the
open
window
with
quite
a
pile
of
books
on
the
occasional
table
beside
her
before
the
large
fireplace
stood
a
displaying
assorted
cakes
and
a
tray
with
all
the
tea
equipage
except
the
teapot
was
on
the
large
the
carpet
was
thick
and
a
spice
of
adventure
was
given
it
by
a
number
of
dyed
mats
hello
said
my
aunt
as
i
appeared
it
s
george
shall
i
serve
the
tea
now
mem
said
the
real
housemaid
surveying
our
greeting
coldly
not
till
ponderevo
comes
meggie
said
my
aunt
and
grimaced
with
extraordinary
swiftness
and
virulence
as
the
housemaid
turned
her
back
meggie
she
calls
herself
said
my
aunt
as
the
door
closed
and
left
me
to
infer
a
certain
want
of
sympathy
you
re
looking
very
jolly
aunt
said
i
what
do
you
think
of
all
this
old
business
he
s
got
asked
my
aunt
seems
a
promising
thing
i
said
i
suppose
there
is
a
business
somewhere
haven
t
you
seen
it
fraid
i
d
say
something
at
it
george
if
i
did
so
he
won
t
let
me
it
came
on
quite
suddenly
brooding
he
was
and
writing
letters
and
sizzling
something
awful
like
a
chestnut
going
to
pop
then
he
came
home
one
day
saying
till
i
thought
he
was
clean
off
his
onion
and
singing
what
was
it
i
m
afloat
i
m
afloat
i
guessed
the
very
thing
you
ve
heard
him
and
saying
our
fortunes
were
made
took
me
out
to
the
ho
burm
restaurant
george
dinner
and
we
had
champagne
stuff
that
blows
up
the
back
of
your
nose
and
makes
you
go
so
and
he
said
at
last
he
d
got
things
worthy
of
me
and
we
moved
here
next
day
it
s
a
swell
house
george
three
pounds
a
week
for
the
rooms
and
he
says
the
business
ll
stand
she
looked
at
me
doubtfully
either
do
that
or
smash
i
said
profoundly
we
discussed
the
question
for
a
moment
mutely
with
our
eyes
my
aunt
slapped
the
pile
of
books
from
mudie
s
i
ve
been
having
such
a
go
of
reading
george
you
never
did
what
do
you
think
of
the
business
i
asked
well
they
ve
let
him
have
money
she
said
and
thought
and
raised
her
eyebrows
it
s
been
a
time
she
went
on
the
flapping
about
me
sitting
doing
nothing
and
him
on
the
go
like
a
rocket
he
s
done
wonders
but
he
wants
you
george
he
wants
you
sometimes
he
s
full
of
hope
talks
of
when
we
re
going
to
have
a
carriage
and
be
in
society
makes
it
seem
so
natural
and
i
hardly
know
whether
my
old
heels
aren
t
up
here
listening
to
him
and
my
old
head
on
the
floor
then
he
gets
depressed
says
he
wants
restraint
says
he
can
make
a
splash
but
can
t
keep
on
says
if
you
don
t
come
in
everything
will
smash
but
you
are
coming
in
she
paused
and
looked
at
me
well
you
don
t
say
you
won
t
come
in
but
look
here
aunt
i
said
do
you
understand
quite
it
s
a
quack
medicine
it
s
there
s
no
law
against
selling
quack
medicine
that
i
know
of
said
my
aunt
she
thought
for
a
minute
and
became
unusually
grave
it
s
our
only
chance
george
she
said
if
it
doesn
t
go
there
came
the
slamming
of
a
door
and
a
loud
bellowing
from
the
next
apartment
through
the
folding
doors
shee
rulk
lies
poo
tom
bo
silly
old
concertina
hark
at
him
george
she
raised
her
voice
don
t
sing
that
you
old
walrus
you
sing
i
m
afloat
one
leaf
of
the
folding
doors
opened
and
my
uncle
appeared
hullo
george
come
along
at
last
gossome
susan
thought
it
over
george
he
said
abruptly
yes
said
i
coming
in
i
paused
for
a
last
moment
and
nodded
yes
ah
he
cried
why
couldn
t
you
say
that
a
week
ago
i
ve
had
false
ideas
about
the
world
i
said
oh
they
don
t
matter
now
yes
i
ll
come
i
ll
take
my
chance
with
you
i
won
t
hesitate
and
i
didn
t
i
stuck
to
that
resolution
for
seven
long
years
chapter
the
third
how
we
made
hum
i
so
i
made
my
peace
with
my
uncle
and
we
set
out
upon
this
bright
enterprise
of
selling
slightly
injurious
rubbish
at
and
a
bottle
including
the
government
stamp
we
made
hum
it
brought
us
wealth
influence
respect
the
confidence
of
endless
people
all
that
my
uncle
promised
me
proved
truth
and
understatement
carried
me
to
freedoms
and
powers
that
no
life
of
scientific
research
no
passionate
service
of
humanity
could
ever
have
given
me
it
was
my
uncle
s
genius
that
did
it
no
doubt
he
needed
me
i
was
i
will
admit
his
indispensable
right
hand
but
his
was
the
brain
to
conceive
he
wrote
every
advertisement
some
of
them
even
he
sketched
you
must
remember
that
his
were
the
days
before
the
time
took
to
enterprise
and
the
vociferous
hawking
of
that
antiquated
encyclopedia
that
alluring
style
of
newspaper
advertisement
with
every
now
and
then
a
convulsive
jump
of
some
attractive
phrase
into
capitals
was
then
almost
a
novelty
many
people
who
are
moderately
well
think
they
are
quite
well
was
one
of
his
early
efforts
the
jerks
in
capitals
were
do
not
need
drugs
or
medicine
and
simply
a
proper
regimen
to
get
you
in
one
was
warned
against
the
chemist
or
druggist
who
pushed
nostrums
on
one
s
attention
that
trash
did
more
harm
than
good
the
thing
needed
was
regimen
and
very
early
too
was
that
bright
little
quarter
column
at
least
it
was
usually
a
quarter
column
in
the
evening
papers
hilarity
like
mountain
air
in
the
the
penetrating
trio
of
questions
are
you
bored
with
your
business
are
you
bored
with
your
dinner
are
you
bored
with
your
wife
that
too
was
in
our
gower
street
days
both
these
we
had
in
our
first
campaign
when
we
worked
london
south
central
and
west
and
then
too
we
had
our
first
poster
the
health
beauty
and
strength
one
that
was
his
design
i
happen
still
to
have
got
by
me
the
first
sketch
he
made
for
it
i
have
reproduced
it
here
with
one
or
two
others
to
enable
the
reader
to
understand
the
mental
quality
that
initiated
these
familiar
ornaments
of
london
the
second
one
is
about
eighteen
months
later
the
germ
of
the
fog
poster
the
third
was
designed
for
an
influenza
epidemic
but
never
issued
these
things
were
only
incidental
in
my
department
i
had
to
polish
them
up
for
the
artist
and
arrange
the
business
of
printing
and
distribution
and
after
my
uncle
had
had
a
violent
and
needless
quarrel
with
the
advertising
manager
of
the
daily
regulator
about
the
amount
of
display
given
to
one
of
his
happy
thoughts
i
also
took
up
the
negotiations
of
advertisements
for
the
press
we
discussed
and
worked
out
distribution
together
first
in
the
floor
in
gower
street
with
my
aunt
sometimes
helping
very
shrewdly
and
then
with
a
steadily
improving
type
of
cigar
and
older
and
older
whisky
in
his
smuggery
at
their
first
house
the
one
in
beckenham
often
we
worked
far
into
the
night
sometimes
until
dawn
we
really
worked
infernally
hard
and
i
recall
we
worked
with
a
very
decided
enthusiasm
not
simply
on
my
uncle
s
part
but
mine
it
was
a
game
an
absurd
but
absurdly
interesting
game
and
the
points
were
scored
in
cases
of
bottles
people
think
a
happy
notion
is
enough
to
make
a
man
rich
that
fortunes
can
be
made
without
toil
it
s
a
dream
as
every
millionaire
except
one
or
two
lucky
gamblers
can
testify
i
doubt
if
rockefeller
in
the
early
days
of
standard
oil
worked
harder
than
we
did
we
worked
far
into
the
night
and
we
also
worked
all
day
we
made
a
rule
to
be
always
dropping
in
at
the
factory
unannounced
to
keep
things
right
for
at
first
we
could
afford
no
properly
responsible
underlings
and
we
traveled
london
pretending
to
be
our
own
representatives
and
making
all
sorts
of
special
arrangements
but
none
of
this
was
my
special
work
and
as
soon
as
we
could
get
other
men
in
i
dropped
the
traveling
though
my
uncle
found
it
particularly
interesting
and
kept
it
up
for
years
does
me
good
george
to
see
the
chaps
behind
their
counters
like
i
was
once
he
explained
my
special
and
distinctive
duty
was
to
give
substance
and
an
outward
and
visible
bottle
to
translate
my
uncle
s
great
imaginings
into
the
creation
of
case
after
case
of
labelled
bottles
of
nonsense
and
the
punctual
discharge
of
them
by
railway
road
and
steamer
towards
their
ultimate
goal
in
the
great
stomach
of
the
people
by
all
modern
standards
the
business
was
as
my
uncle
would
say
absolutely
bona
we
sold
our
stuff
and
got
the
money
and
spent
the
money
honestly
in
lies
and
clamour
to
sell
more
stuff
section
by
section
we
spread
it
over
the
whole
of
the
british
isles
first
working
the
london
suburbs
then
the
outer
suburbs
then
the
home
counties
then
going
with
new
bills
and
a
more
pious
style
of
ad
into
wales
a
great
field
always
for
a
new
and
then
into
lancashire
my
uncle
had
in
his
inner
office
a
big
map
of
england
and
as
we
took
up
fresh
sections
of
the
local
press
and
our
consignments
invaded
new
areas
flags
for
advertisements
and
pink
underlines
for
orders
showed
our
progress
the
romance
of
modern
commerce
george
my
uncle
would
say
rubbing
his
hands
together
and
drawing
in
air
through
his
teeth
the
romance
of
modern
commerce
eh
conquest
province
by
province
like
we
subjugated
england
and
wales
we
rolled
over
the
cheviots
with
a
special
adaptation
containing
eleven
per
cent
of
absolute
alcohol
thistle
we
also
had
the
fog
poster
adapted
to
a
kilted
briton
in
a
misty
highland
scene
under
the
shadow
of
our
great
leading
line
we
were
presently
taking
subsidiary
specialties
into
action
hair
stimulant
was
our
first
supplement
then
came
concentrated
for
the
eyes
that
didn
t
go
but
we
had
a
considerable
success
with
the
hair
stimulant
we
broached
the
subject
i
remember
in
a
little
catechism
beginning
why
does
the
hair
fall
out
because
the
follicles
are
fagged
what
are
the
follicles
so
it
went
on
to
the
climax
that
the
hair
stimulant
contained
all
the
essential
principles
of
that
most
reviving
tonic
together
with
an
emollient
and
nutritious
oil
derived
from
crude
neat
s
foot
oil
by
a
process
of
refinement
separation
and
deodorization
it
will
be
manifest
to
any
one
of
scientific
attainments
that
in
neat
s
foot
oil
derived
from
the
hoofs
and
horns
of
beasts
we
must
necessarily
have
a
natural
skin
and
hair
and
we
also
did
admirable
things
with
our
next
subsidiaries
lozenges
and
these
we
urged
upon
the
public
for
their
extraordinary
nutritive
and
recuperative
value
in
cases
of
fatigue
and
strain
we
gave
them
posters
and
illustrated
advertisements
showing
climbers
hanging
from
marvelously
vertical
cliffs
cyclist
champions
upon
the
track
mounted
messengers
engaged
in
rides
soldiers
lying
out
in
action
under
a
hot
sun
you
can
go
for
hours
we
declared
on
we
didn
t
say
whether
you
could
return
on
the
same
commodity
we
also
showed
a
dreadfully
barristerish
barrister
wig
teeth
a
horribly
portrait
of
all
existing
barristers
talking
at
a
table
and
beneath
this
legend
a
four
hours
speech
on
lozenges
and
as
fresh
as
when
he
then
brought
in
regiments
of
revivalist
ministers
politicians
and
the
like
i
really
do
believe
there
was
an
element
of
kick
in
the
strychnine
in
these
lozenges
especially
in
those
made
according
to
our
earlier
formula
for
we
altered
all
our
formulae
invariably
weakening
them
enormously
as
sales
got
ahead
in
a
little
while
so
it
seems
to
me
now
we
were
employing
travelers
and
opening
up
great
britain
at
the
rate
of
a
hundred
square
miles
a
day
all
the
organisation
throughout
was
sketched
in
a
crude
entangled
fashion
by
my
uncle
and
all
of
it
had
to
be
worked
out
into
a
practicable
scheme
of
quantities
and
expenditure
by
me
we
had
a
lot
of
trouble
finding
our
travelers
in
the
end
at
least
half
of
them
were
a
wonderful
breed
for
selling
medicine
we
had
still
more
trouble
over
our
factory
manager
because
of
the
secrets
of
the
inner
room
and
in
the
end
we
got
a
very
capable
woman
hampton
diggs
who
had
formerly
managed
a
large
millinery
workroom
whom
we
could
trust
to
keep
everything
in
good
working
order
without
finding
out
anything
that
wasn
t
put
exactly
under
her
loyal
and
energetic
nose
she
conceived
a
high
opinion
of
and
took
it
in
all
forms
and
large
quantities
so
long
as
i
knew
her
it
didn
t
seem
to
do
her
any
harm
and
she
kept
the
girls
going
quite
wonderfully
my
uncle
s
last
addition
to
the
group
was
the
mouthwash
the
reader
has
probably
read
a
hundred
times
that
inspiring
inquiry
of
his
you
are
young
yet
but
are
you
sure
nothing
has
aged
your
gums
and
after
that
we
took
over
the
agency
for
three
or
four
good
american
lines
that
worked
in
with
our
own
and
could
be
handled
with
it
texan
embrocation
and
to
clear
the
system
were
the
chief
i
set
down
these
bare
facts
to
me
they
are
all
linked
with
the
figure
of
my
uncle
in
some
of
the
old
seventeenth
and
early
eighteenth
century
prayerbooks
at
bladesover
there
used
to
be
illustrations
with
long
scrolls
coming
out
of
the
mouths
of
the
figures
i
wish
i
could
write
all
this
last
chapter
on
a
scroll
coming
out
of
the
head
of
my
uncle
show
it
all
the
time
as
unfolding
and
pouring
out
from
a
short
fattening
man
with
stiff
cropped
hair
disobedient
glasses
on
a
perky
little
nose
and
a
round
stare
behind
them
i
wish
i
could
show
you
him
breathing
hard
and
a
little
through
his
nose
as
his
pen
scrabbled
out
some
absurd
inspiration
for
a
poster
or
a
picture
page
and
make
you
hear
his
voice
charged
with
solemn
import
like
the
voice
of
a
squeaky
prophet
saying
george
list
n
i
got
an
ideer
i
got
a
notion
george
i
should
put
myself
into
the
same
picture
best
setting
for
us
i
think
would
be
the
beckenham
snuggery
because
there
we
worked
hardest
it
would
be
the
lamplit
room
of
the
early
nineties
and
the
clock
upon
the
mantel
would
indicate
midnight
or
later
we
would
be
sitting
on
either
side
of
the
fire
i
with
a
pipe
my
uncle
with
a
cigar
or
cigarette
there
would
be
glasses
standing
inside
the
brass
fender
our
expressions
would
be
very
grave
my
uncle
used
to
sit
right
back
in
his
armchair
his
toes
always
turned
in
when
he
was
sitting
down
and
his
legs
had
a
way
of
looking
curved
as
though
they
hadn
t
bones
or
joints
but
were
stuffed
with
sawdust
george
whad
yer
think
of
for
he
would
say
no
good
that
i
can
oom
no
harm
trying
george
we
can
but
i
would
suck
my
pipe
hard
to
get
at
unless
we
sold
our
stuff
specially
at
the
docks
might
do
a
special
at
cook
s
office
or
in
the
continental
it
ud
give
em
confidence
he
would
zzzz
with
his
glasses
reflecting
the
red
of
the
glowing
coals
no
good
hiding
our
light
under
a
bushel
he
would
remark
i
never
really
determined
whether
my
uncle
regarded
as
a
fraud
or
whether
he
didn
t
come
to
believe
in
it
in
a
kind
of
way
by
the
mere
reiteration
of
his
own
assertions
i
think
that
his
average
attitude
was
one
of
kindly
almost
parental
toleration
i
remember
saying
on
one
occasion
but
you
don
t
suppose
this
stuff
ever
did
a
human
being
the
slightest
good
all
and
how
his
face
assumed
a
look
of
protest
as
of
one
reproving
harshness
and
dogmatism
you
ve
a
hard
nature
george
he
said
you
re
too
ready
to
run
things
down
how
can
one
tell
how
can
one
venture
to
tell
i
suppose
any
creative
and
developing
game
would
have
interested
me
in
those
years
at
any
rate
i
know
i
put
as
much
zeal
into
this
as
any
young
lieutenant
could
have
done
who
suddenly
found
himself
in
command
of
a
ship
it
was
extraordinarily
interesting
to
me
to
figure
out
the
advantage
accruing
from
this
shortening
of
the
process
or
that
and
to
weigh
it
against
the
capital
cost
of
the
alteration
i
made
a
sort
of
machine
for
sticking
on
the
labels
that
i
patented
to
this
day
there
is
a
little
trickle
of
royalties
to
me
from
that
i
also
contrived
to
have
our
mixture
made
concentrated
got
the
bottles
which
all
came
sliding
down
a
guarded
nearly
filled
with
distilled
water
at
one
tap
and
dripped
our
magic
ingredients
in
at
the
next
this
was
an
immense
economy
of
space
for
the
inner
sanctum
for
the
bottling
we
needed
special
taps
and
these
too
i
invented
and
patented
we
had
a
sort
of
endless
band
of
bottles
sliding
along
an
inclined
glass
trough
made
slippery
with
running
water
at
one
end
a
girl
held
them
up
to
the
light
put
aside
any
that
were
imperfect
and
placed
the
others
in
the
trough
the
filling
was
automatic
at
the
other
end
a
girl
slipped
in
the
cork
and
drove
it
home
with
a
little
mallet
each
tank
the
little
one
for
the
vivifying
ingredients
and
the
big
one
for
distilled
water
had
a
level
indicator
and
inside
i
had
a
float
arrangement
that
stopped
the
slide
whenever
either
had
sunk
too
low
another
girl
stood
ready
with
my
machine
to
label
the
corked
bottles
and
hand
them
to
the
three
packers
who
slipped
them
into
their
outer
papers
and
put
them
with
a
pad
of
corrugated
paper
between
each
pair
into
a
little
groove
from
which
they
could
be
made
to
slide
neatly
into
position
in
our
standard
it
sounds
wild
i
know
but
i
believe
i
was
the
first
man
in
the
city
of
london
to
pack
patent
medicines
through
the
side
of
the
to
discover
there
was
a
better
way
in
than
by
the
lid
our
cases
packed
themselves
practically
had
only
to
be
put
into
position
on
a
little
wheeled
tray
and
when
full
pulled
to
the
lift
that
dropped
them
to
the
men
downstairs
who
padded
up
the
free
space
and
nailed
on
top
and
side
our
girls
moreover
packed
with
corrugated
paper
and
box
partitions
when
everybody
else
was
using
expensive
young
men
to
pack
through
the
top
of
the
box
with
straw
many
breakages
and
much
waste
and
confusion
ii
as
i
look
back
at
them
now
those
energetic
years
seem
all
compacted
to
a
year
or
so
from
the
days
of
our
first
hazardous
beginning
in
farringdon
street
with
barely
a
thousand
pounds
worth
of
stuff
or
credit
all
told
and
that
got
by
something
perilously
like
snatching
to
the
days
when
my
uncle
went
to
the
public
on
behalf
of
himself
and
me
share
and
our
silent
partners
the
drug
wholesalers
and
the
printing
people
and
the
owner
of
that
group
of
magazines
and
newspapers
to
ask
with
honest
confidence
for
those
silent
partners
were
remarkably
sorry
i
know
that
they
had
not
taken
larger
shares
and
given
us
longer
credit
when
the
subscriptions
came
pouring
in
my
uncle
had
a
clear
half
to
play
with
including
the
understood
to
be
mine
think
of
it
for
the
goodwill
in
a
string
of
lies
and
a
trade
in
bottles
of
mitigated
water
do
you
realise
the
madness
of
the
world
that
sanctions
such
a
thing
perhaps
you
don
t
at
times
use
and
wont
certainly
blinded
me
if
it
had
not
been
for
ewart
i
don
t
think
i
should
have
had
an
inkling
of
the
wonderfulness
of
this
development
of
my
fortunes
i
should
have
grown
accustomed
to
it
fallen
in
with
all
its
delusions
as
completely
as
my
uncle
presently
did
he
was
immensely
proud
of
the
flotation
they
ve
never
been
given
such
value
he
said
for
a
dozen
but
ewart
with
his
gesticulating
hairy
hands
and
bony
wrists
his
chorus
to
all
this
as
it
played
itself
over
again
in
my
memory
and
he
kept
my
fundamental
absurdity
illuminated
for
me
during
all
this
astonishing
time
it
s
just
on
all
fours
with
the
rest
of
things
he
remarked
only
more
so
you
needn
t
think
you
re
anything
out
of
the
i
remember
one
disquisition
very
distinctly
it
was
just
after
ewart
had
been
to
paris
on
a
mysterious
expedition
to
rough
in
some
work
for
a
rising
american
sculptor
this
young
man
had
a
commission
for
an
allegorical
figure
of
truth
draped
of
course
for
his
state
capitol
and
he
needed
help
ewart
had
returned
with
his
hair
cut
en
brosse
and
with
his
costume
completely
translated
into
french
he
wore
i
remember
a
bicycling
suit
of
baggy
beyond
ageing
the
only
creditable
thing
about
it
was
that
it
had
evidently
not
been
made
for
him
a
voluminous
black
tie
a
decadent
soft
felt
hat
and
several
french
expletives
of
a
sinister
description
silly
clothes
aren
t
they
he
said
at
the
sight
of
my
startled
eye
i
don
t
know
why
i
got
m
they
seemed
all
right
over
he
had
come
down
to
our
raggett
street
place
to
discuss
a
benevolent
project
of
mine
for
a
poster
by
him
and
he
scattered
remarkable
discourse
over
the
heads
i
hope
it
was
over
the
heads
of
our
bottlers
what
i
like
about
it
all
ponderevo
is
its
poetry
that
s
where
we
get
the
pull
of
the
animals
no
animal
would
ever
run
a
factory
like
this
think
one
remembers
the
beaver
of
course
he
might
very
possibly
bottle
things
but
would
he
stick
a
label
round
em
and
sell
em
the
beaver
is
a
dreamy
fool
i
ll
admit
him
and
his
dams
but
after
all
there
s
a
sort
of
protection
about
em
a
kind
of
muddy
practicality
they
prevent
things
getting
at
him
and
it
s
not
your
poetry
only
it
s
the
poetry
of
the
customer
too
poet
answering
to
poet
soul
to
soul
health
strength
and
beauty
in
a
bottle
the
magic
philtre
like
a
fairy
tale
think
of
the
people
to
whom
your
bottles
of
footle
go
i
m
calling
it
footle
ponderevo
out
of
praise
he
said
in
parenthesis
think
of
the
little
clerks
and
jaded
women
and
overworked
people
people
overstrained
with
wanting
to
do
people
overstrained
with
wanting
to
be
people
in
fact
overstrained
the
real
trouble
of
life
ponderevo
isn
t
that
we
exist
that
s
a
vulgar
error
the
real
trouble
is
that
we
don
t
really
exist
and
we
want
to
that
s
what
this
in
the
highest
sense
just
stands
for
the
hunger
to
be
for
once
really
alive
to
the
finger
tips
nobody
wants
to
do
and
be
the
things
people
are
nobody
you
don
t
want
to
preside
over
this
this
bottling
i
don
t
want
to
wear
these
beastly
clothes
and
be
led
about
by
you
nobody
wants
to
keep
on
sticking
labels
on
silly
bottles
at
so
many
farthings
a
gross
that
isn
t
existing
that
s
sus
substratum
none
of
us
want
to
be
what
we
are
or
to
do
what
we
do
except
as
a
sort
of
basis
what
do
we
want
you
know
i
know
nobody
confesses
what
we
all
want
to
be
is
something
perpetually
young
and
beautiful
young
joves
young
joves
ponderevo
his
voice
became
loud
harsh
and
declamatory
pursuing
coy
nymphs
through
everlasting
there
was
a
listening
hang
in
the
work
about
us
come
downstairs
i
interrupted
we
can
talk
better
i
can
talk
better
here
he
answered
he
was
just
going
on
but
fortunately
the
implacable
face
of
hampton
diggs
appeared
down
the
aisle
of
bottling
machines
all
right
he
said
i
ll
in
the
little
sanctum
below
my
uncle
was
taking
a
digestive
pause
after
his
lunch
and
by
no
means
alert
his
presence
sent
ewart
back
to
the
theme
of
modern
commerce
over
the
excellent
cigar
my
uncle
gave
him
he
behaved
with
the
elaborate
deference
due
to
a
business
magnate
from
an
unknown
man
what
i
was
pointing
out
to
your
nephew
sir
said
ewart
putting
both
elbows
on
the
table
was
the
poetry
of
commerce
he
doesn
t
you
know
seem
to
see
it
at
my
uncle
nodded
brightly
whad
i
tell
im
he
said
round
his
cigar
we
are
artists
you
and
i
sir
can
talk
if
you
will
permit
me
as
one
artist
to
another
it
s
advertisement
has
done
it
advertisement
has
revolutionised
trade
and
industry
it
is
going
to
revolutionise
the
world
the
old
merchant
used
to
tote
about
commodities
the
new
one
creates
values
doesn
t
need
to
tote
he
takes
something
that
isn
t
worth
anything
or
something
that
isn
t
particularly
worth
anything
and
he
makes
it
worth
something
he
takes
mustard
that
is
just
like
anybody
else
s
mustard
and
he
goes
about
saying
shouting
singing
chalking
on
walls
writing
inside
people
s
books
putting
it
everywhere
smith
s
mustard
is
the
and
behold
it
is
the
best
true
said
my
uncle
chubbily
and
with
a
dreamy
sense
of
mysticism
true
it
s
just
like
an
artist
he
takes
a
lump
of
white
marble
on
the
verge
of
a
he
chips
it
about
he
makes
he
makes
a
monument
to
himself
and
others
a
monument
the
world
will
not
willingly
let
die
talking
of
mustard
sir
i
was
at
clapham
junction
the
other
day
and
all
the
banks
are
overgrown
with
horse
radish
that
s
got
loose
from
a
garden
somewhere
you
know
what
horseradish
is
grows
like
wildfire
spreads
spreads
i
stood
at
the
end
of
the
platform
looking
at
the
stuff
and
thinking
about
it
like
fame
i
thought
rank
and
wild
where
it
isn
t
wanted
why
don
t
the
really
good
things
in
life
grow
like
horseradish
i
thought
my
mind
went
off
in
a
peculiar
way
it
does
from
that
to
the
idea
that
mustard
costs
a
penny
a
tin
i
bought
some
the
other
day
for
a
ham
i
had
it
came
into
my
head
that
it
would
be
ripping
good
business
to
use
horseradish
to
adulterate
mustard
i
had
a
sort
of
idea
that
i
could
plunge
into
business
on
that
get
rich
and
come
back
to
my
own
proper
monumental
art
again
and
then
i
said
but
why
adulterate
i
don
t
like
the
idea
of
shabby
said
my
uncle
nodding
his
head
bound
to
get
found
out
and
totally
unnecessary
too
why
not
do
up
a
mixture
pounded
horseradish
and
a
quarter
mustard
give
it
a
fancy
name
and
sell
it
at
twice
the
mustard
price
see
i
very
nearly
started
the
business
straight
away
only
something
happened
my
train
came
jolly
good
ideer
said
my
uncle
he
looked
at
me
that
really
is
an
ideer
george
he
said
take
shavin
s
again
you
know
that
poem
of
longfellow
s
sir
that
sounds
exactly
like
the
first
declension
what
is
it
marr
s
a
maker
men
say
my
uncle
nodded
and
gurgled
some
quotation
that
died
away
jolly
good
poem
george
he
said
in
an
aside
to
me
well
it
s
about
a
carpenter
and
a
poetic
victorian
child
you
know
and
some
shavin
s
the
child
made
no
end
out
of
the
shavin
s
so
might
you
powder
em
they
might
be
anything
soak
em
in
jipper
powder
em
and
get
a
little
tar
and
turpentinous
smell
in
for
hot
baths
a
certain
cure
for
the
scourge
of
influenza
there
s
all
these
patent
grain
foods
what
americans
call
cereals
i
believe
i
m
right
sir
in
saying
they
re
no
said
my
uncle
removing
his
cigar
as
far
as
i
can
find
out
it
s
really
grain
spoilt
grain
i
ve
been
going
into
well
there
you
are
said
ewart
say
it
s
spoilt
grain
it
carried
out
my
case
just
as
well
your
modern
commerce
is
no
more
buying
and
selling
than
sculpture
it
s
mercy
it
s
salvation
it
s
rescue
work
it
takes
all
sorts
of
fallen
commodities
by
the
hand
and
raises
them
cana
isn
t
in
it
you
turn
water
into
s
all
right
said
my
uncle
suddenly
grave
we
aren
t
talking
of
your
nephew
sir
is
hard
he
wants
everything
to
go
to
a
sort
of
predestinated
end
he
s
a
calvinist
of
commerce
offer
him
a
dustbin
full
of
stuff
he
calls
it
refuse
passes
by
on
the
other
side
now
you
sir
you
d
make
cinders
respect
my
uncle
regarded
him
dubiously
for
a
moment
but
there
was
a
touch
of
appreciation
in
his
eye
might
make
em
into
a
sort
of
sanitary
brick
he
reflected
over
his
cigar
end
or
a
friable
biscuit
why
not
you
might
advertise
why
are
birds
so
bright
because
they
digest
their
food
perfectly
why
do
they
digest
their
food
so
perfectly
because
they
have
a
gizzard
why
hasn
t
man
a
gizzard
because
he
can
buy
ponderevo
s
asphalt
triturating
friable
biscuit
which
is
he
delivered
the
last
words
in
a
shout
with
his
hairy
hand
flourished
in
the
air
damn
clever
fellow
said
my
uncle
after
he
had
one
i
know
a
man
when
i
see
one
he
d
do
but
drunk
i
should
say
but
that
only
makes
some
chap
brighter
if
he
wants
to
do
that
poster
he
can
zzzz
that
ideer
of
his
about
the
horseradish
there
s
something
in
that
george
i
m
going
to
think
over
that
i
may
say
at
once
that
my
poster
project
came
to
nothing
in
the
end
though
ewart
devoted
an
interesting
week
to
the
matter
he
let
his
unfortunate
disposition
to
irony
run
away
with
him
he
produced
a
picture
of
two
beavers
with
a
subtle
likeness
he
said
to
myself
and
my
uncle
the
likeness
to
my
uncle
certainly
wasn
t
half
bad
and
they
were
bottling
rows
and
rows
of
with
the
legend
modern
it
certainly
wouldn
t
have
sold
a
case
though
he
urged
it
on
me
one
cheerful
evening
on
the
ground
that
it
would
arouse
in
addition
he
produced
a
quite
shocking
study
of
my
uncle
excessively
and
needlessly
nude
but
so
far
as
i
was
able
to
judge
an
admirable
likeness
engaged
in
feats
of
strength
of
a
gargantuan
type
before
an
audience
of
deboshed
and
shattered
ladies
the
legend
health
beauty
strength
below
gave
a
needed
point
to
his
parody
this
he
hung
up
in
the
studio
over
the
oil
shop
with
a
flap
of
brown
paper
by
way
of
a
curtain
over
it
to
accentuate
its
libellous
offence
chapter
the
fourth
marion
i
as
i
look
back
on
those
days
in
which
we
built
up
the
great
property
out
of
human
hope
and
credit
for
bottles
and
rent
and
printing
i
see
my
life
as
it
were
arranged
in
two
parallel
columns
of
unequal
width
a
wider
more
diffused
eventful
and
various
one
which
continually
broadens
out
the
business
side
of
my
life
and
a
narrow
darker
and
darkling
one
shot
ever
and
again
with
a
gleam
of
happiness
my
with
marion
for
of
course
i
married
marion
i
didn
t
as
a
matter
of
fact
marry
her
until
a
year
after
was
thoroughly
afloat
and
then
only
after
conflicts
and
discussions
of
a
quite
strenuous
sort
by
that
time
i
was
it
seems
the
next
thing
to
childhood
now
we
were
both
in
certain
directions
unusually
ignorant
and
simple
we
were
temperamentally
antagonistic
and
we
hadn
t
i
don
t
think
we
were
capable
of
an
idea
in
common
she
was
young
and
extraordinarily
conventional
she
seemed
never
to
have
an
idea
of
her
own
but
always
the
idea
of
her
class
and
i
was
young
and
sceptical
enterprising
and
passionate
the
two
links
that
held
us
together
were
the
intense
appeal
her
physical
beauty
had
for
me
and
her
appreciation
of
her
importance
in
my
thoughts
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
my
passion
for
her
in
her
i
had
discovered
woman
desired
the
nights
i
have
lain
awake
on
account
of
her
writhing
biting
my
wrists
in
a
fever
of
longing
i
have
told
how
i
got
myself
a
silk
hat
and
black
coat
to
please
her
on
sunday
to
the
derision
of
some
of
my
who
charged
to
meet
me
and
how
we
became
engaged
but
that
was
only
the
beginning
of
our
difference
to
her
that
meant
the
beginning
of
a
not
unpleasant
little
secrecy
an
occasional
use
of
verbal
endearments
perhaps
even
kisses
it
was
something
to
go
on
indefinitely
interfering
in
no
way
with
her
gossiping
spells
of
work
at
smithie
s
to
me
it
was
a
pledge
to
come
together
into
the
utmost
intimacy
of
soul
and
body
so
soon
as
we
could
contrive
it
i
don
t
know
if
it
will
strike
the
reader
that
i
am
setting
out
to
discuss
the
queer
unwise
love
relationship
and
my
bungle
of
a
marriage
with
excessive
solemnity
but
to
me
it
seems
to
reach
out
to
vastly
wider
issues
than
our
little
personal
affair
i
ve
thought
over
my
life
in
these
last
few
years
i
ve
tried
to
get
at
least
a
little
wisdom
out
of
it
and
in
particular
i
ve
thought
over
this
part
of
my
life
i
m
enormously
impressed
by
the
ignorant
unguided
way
in
which
we
two
entangled
ourselves
with
each
other
it
seems
to
me
the
queerest
thing
in
all
this
network
of
misunderstandings
and
misstatements
and
faulty
and
ramshackle
conventions
which
makes
up
our
social
order
as
the
individual
meets
it
that
we
should
have
come
together
so
accidentally
and
so
blindly
because
we
were
no
more
than
samples
of
the
common
fate
love
is
not
only
the
cardinal
fact
in
the
individual
life
but
the
most
important
concern
of
the
community
after
all
the
way
in
which
the
young
people
of
this
generation
pair
off
determines
the
fate
of
the
nation
all
the
other
affairs
of
the
state
are
subsidiary
to
that
and
we
leave
it
to
flushed
and
blundering
youth
to
stumble
on
its
own
significance
with
nothing
to
guide
in
but
shocked
looks
and
sentimental
twaddle
and
base
whisperings
and
examples
i
have
tried
to
indicate
something
of
my
own
sexual
development
in
the
preceding
chapter
nobody
was
ever
frank
and
decent
with
me
in
this
relation
nobody
no
book
ever
came
and
said
to
me
thus
and
thus
is
the
world
made
and
so
and
so
is
necessary
everything
came
obscurely
indefinitely
perplexingly
and
all
i
knew
of
law
or
convention
in
the
matter
had
the
form
of
threatenings
and
prohibitions
except
through
the
furtive
shameful
talk
of
my
coevals
at
goudhurst
and
wimblehurst
i
was
not
even
warned
against
quite
horrible
dangers
my
ideas
were
made
partly
of
instinct
partly
of
a
romantic
imagination
partly
woven
out
of
a
medley
of
scraps
of
suggestion
that
came
to
me
haphazard
i
had
read
widely
and
confusedly
vathek
shelley
tom
paine
plutarch
carlyle
haeckel
william
morris
the
bible
the
freethinker
the
clarion
the
woman
who
did
i
mention
the
ingredients
that
come
first
to
mind
all
sorts
of
ideas
were
jumbled
up
in
me
and
never
a
lucid
explanation
but
it
was
evident
to
me
that
the
world
regarded
shelley
for
example
as
a
very
heroic
as
well
as
beautiful
person
and
that
to
defy
convention
and
succumb
magnificently
to
passion
was
the
proper
thing
to
do
to
gain
the
respect
and
affection
of
all
decent
people
and
the
of
marion
s
mind
in
the
matter
was
an
equally
irrational
affair
her
training
had
been
one
not
simply
of
silences
but
suppressions
an
enormous
force
of
suggestion
had
so
shaped
her
that
the
intense
natural
fastidiousness
of
girlhood
had
developed
into
an
absolute
perversion
of
instinct
for
all
that
is
cardinal
in
this
essential
business
of
life
she
had
one
inseparable
epithet
without
any
such
training
she
would
have
been
a
shy
lover
but
now
she
was
an
impossible
one
for
the
rest
she
had
derived
i
suppose
partly
from
the
sort
of
fiction
she
got
from
the
public
library
and
partly
from
the
workroom
talk
at
smithie
s
so
far
as
the
former
origin
went
she
had
an
idea
of
love
as
a
state
of
worship
and
service
on
the
part
of
the
man
and
of
condescension
on
the
part
of
the
woman
there
was
nothing
horrid
about
it
in
any
fiction
she
had
read
the
man
gave
presents
did
services
sought
to
be
in
every
way
delightful
the
woman
went
out
with
him
smiled
at
him
was
kissed
by
him
in
decorous
secrecy
and
if
he
chanced
to
offend
denied
her
countenance
and
presence
usually
she
did
something
for
his
good
to
him
made
him
go
to
church
made
him
give
up
smoking
or
gambling
smartened
him
up
quite
at
the
end
of
the
story
came
a
marriage
and
after
that
the
interest
ceased
that
was
the
tenor
of
marion
s
fiction
but
i
think
the
conversation
at
smithie
s
did
something
to
modify
that
at
smithie
s
it
was
recognised
i
think
that
a
fellow
was
a
possession
to
be
desired
that
it
was
better
to
be
engaged
to
a
fellow
than
not
that
fellows
had
to
be
kept
they
might
be
mislaid
they
might
even
be
stolen
there
was
a
case
of
stealing
at
smithie
s
and
many
tears
smithie
i
met
before
we
were
married
and
afterwards
she
became
a
frequent
visitor
to
our
house
at
ealing
she
was
a
thin
girl
of
thirtyodd
with
prominent
teeth
a
eager
voice
and
a
disposition
to
be
urgently
smart
in
her
dress
her
hats
were
startling
and
various
but
invariably
disconcerting
and
she
talked
in
a
rapid
nervous
flow
that
was
hilarious
rather
than
witty
and
broken
by
little
screams
of
oh
my
dear
and
you
never
did
she
was
the
first
woman
i
ever
met
who
used
scent
poor
old
smithie
what
a
harmless
kindly
soul
she
really
was
and
how
heartily
i
detested
her
out
of
the
profits
on
the
persian
robes
she
supported
a
sister
s
family
of
three
children
she
helped
a
worthless
brother
and
overflowed
in
help
even
to
her
workgirls
but
that
didn
t
weigh
with
me
in
those
times
it
was
one
of
the
intense
minor
irritations
of
my
married
life
that
smithie
s
whirlwind
chatter
seemed
to
me
to
have
far
more
influence
with
marion
than
anything
i
had
to
say
before
all
things
i
coveted
her
grip
upon
marion
s
inaccessible
mind
in
the
workroom
at
smithie
s
i
gathered
they
always
spoke
of
me
demurely
as
a
certain
i
was
rumoured
to
be
dreadfully
clever
and
there
were
doubts
not
altogether
without
justification
of
the
sweetness
of
my
temper
ii
well
these
general
explanations
will
enable
the
reader
to
understand
the
distressful
times
we
two
had
together
when
presently
i
began
to
feel
on
a
footing
with
marion
and
to
fumble
conversationally
for
the
mind
and
the
wonderful
passion
i
felt
obstinately
and
stupidity
must
be
in
her
i
think
she
thought
me
the
maddest
of
sane
men
clever
in
fact
which
at
smithie
s
was
i
suppose
the
next
thing
to
insanity
a
word
intimating
incomprehensible
and
incalculable
motives
she
could
be
shocked
at
anything
she
misunderstood
everything
and
her
weapon
was
a
sulky
silence
that
knitted
her
brows
spoilt
her
mouth
and
robbed
her
face
of
beauty
well
if
we
can
t
agree
i
don
t
see
why
you
should
go
on
talking
she
used
to
say
that
would
always
enrage
me
beyond
measure
or
i
m
afraid
i
m
not
clever
enough
to
understand
silly
little
people
i
see
it
all
now
but
then
i
was
no
older
than
she
and
i
couldn
t
see
anything
but
that
marion
for
some
inexplicable
reason
wouldn
t
come
alive
we
would
contrive
walks
on
sunday
and
part
speechless
with
the
anger
of
indefinable
offences
poor
marion
the
things
i
tried
to
put
before
her
my
fermenting
ideas
about
theology
about
socialism
about
aesthetics
the
very
words
appalled
her
gave
her
the
faint
chill
of
approaching
impropriety
the
terror
of
a
very
present
intellectual
impossibility
then
by
an
enormous
effort
i
would
suppress
myself
for
a
time
and
continue
a
talk
that
made
her
happy
about
smithie
s
brother
about
the
new
girl
who
had
come
to
the
workroom
about
the
house
we
would
presently
live
in
but
there
we
differed
a
little
i
wanted
to
be
accessible
to
paul
s
or
cannon
street
station
and
she
had
set
her
mind
quite
resolutely
upon
eating
it
wasn
t
by
any
means
quarreling
all
the
time
you
understand
she
liked
me
to
play
the
lover
nicely
she
liked
the
effect
of
going
about
we
had
lunches
we
went
to
earl
s
court
to
kew
to
theatres
and
concerts
but
not
often
to
concerts
because
though
marion
liked
music
she
didn
t
like
too
much
of
it
to
picture
shows
and
there
was
a
nonsensical
sort
of
babytalk
i
picked
up
i
forget
where
now
that
became
a
mighty
peacemaker
her
worst
offence
for
me
was
an
occasional
excursion
into
the
smithie
style
of
dressing
debased
west
kensington
for
she
had
no
sense
at
all
of
her
own
beauty
she
had
no
comprehension
whatever
of
beauty
of
the
body
and
she
could
slash
her
beautiful
lines
to
rags
with
and
trimmings
thank
heaven
a
natural
refinement
a
natural
timidity
and
her
extremely
slender
purse
kept
her
from
the
real
smithie
efflorescence
poor
simple
beautiful
kindly
limited
marion
now
that
i
am
i
can
look
back
at
her
with
all
my
old
admiration
and
none
of
my
old
bitterness
with
a
new
affection
and
not
a
scrap
of
passion
and
take
her
part
against
the
equally
stupid
sensuous
intellectual
sprawl
i
used
to
be
i
was
a
young
beast
for
her
to
have
married
a
hound
beast
with
her
it
was
my
business
to
understand
and
control
and
i
exacted
fellowship
passion
we
became
engaged
as
i
have
told
we
broke
it
off
and
joined
again
we
went
through
a
succession
of
such
phases
we
had
no
sort
of
idea
what
was
wrong
with
us
presently
we
were
formally
engaged
i
had
a
wonderful
interview
with
her
father
in
which
he
was
stupendously
grave
and
h
less
wanted
to
know
about
my
origins
and
was
tolerant
exasperatingly
tolerant
because
my
mother
was
a
servant
and
afterwards
her
mother
took
to
kissing
me
and
i
bought
a
ring
but
the
speechless
aunt
i
gathered
didn
t
approve
having
doubts
of
my
religiosity
whenever
we
were
estranged
we
could
keep
apart
for
days
and
to
begin
with
every
such
separation
was
a
relief
and
then
i
would
want
her
a
restless
longing
would
come
upon
me
i
would
think
of
the
flow
of
her
arms
of
the
soft
gracious
bend
of
her
body
i
would
lie
awake
or
dream
of
a
transfigured
marion
of
light
and
fire
it
was
indeed
dame
nature
driving
me
on
to
womankind
in
her
stupid
inexorable
way
but
i
thought
it
was
the
need
of
marion
that
troubled
me
so
i
always
went
back
to
marion
at
last
and
made
it
up
and
more
or
less
conceded
or
ignored
whatever
thing
had
parted
us
and
more
and
more
i
urged
her
to
marry
me
in
the
long
run
that
became
a
fixed
idea
it
entangled
my
will
and
my
pride
i
told
myself
i
was
not
going
to
be
beaten
i
hardened
to
the
business
i
think
as
a
matter
of
fact
my
real
passion
for
marion
had
waned
enormously
long
before
we
were
married
that
she
had
lived
it
down
by
sheer
irresponsiveness
when
i
felt
sure
of
my
three
hundred
a
year
she
stipulated
for
delay
twelve
months
delay
to
see
how
things
would
turn
there
were
times
when
she
seemed
simply
an
antagonist
holding
out
irritatingly
against
something
i
had
to
settle
moreover
i
began
to
be
greatly
distracted
by
the
interest
and
excitement
of
s
success
by
the
change
and
movement
in
things
the
going
to
and
fro
i
would
forget
her
for
days
together
and
then
desire
her
with
an
irritating
intensity
at
last
one
saturday
afternoon
after
a
brooding
morning
i
determined
almost
savagely
that
these
delays
must
end
i
went
off
to
the
little
home
at
walham
green
and
made
marion
come
with
me
to
putney
common
marion
wasn
t
at
home
when
i
got
there
and
i
had
to
fret
for
a
time
and
talk
to
her
father
who
was
just
back
from
his
office
he
explained
and
enjoying
himself
in
his
own
way
in
the
greenhouse
i
m
going
to
ask
your
daughter
to
marry
me
i
said
i
think
we
ve
been
waiting
long
i
don
t
approve
of
long
engagements
either
said
her
father
but
marion
will
have
her
own
way
about
it
anyhow
seen
this
new
powdered
fertiliser
i
went
in
to
talk
to
ramboat
she
ll
want
time
to
get
her
things
said
ramboat
i
and
marion
sat
down
together
on
a
little
seat
under
some
trees
at
the
top
of
putney
hill
and
i
came
to
my
point
abruptly
look
here
marion
i
said
are
you
going
to
marry
me
or
are
you
not
she
smiled
at
me
well
she
said
we
re
engaged
aren
t
we
that
can
t
go
on
for
ever
will
you
marry
me
next
week
she
looked
me
in
the
face
we
can
t
she
said
you
promised
to
marry
me
when
i
had
three
hundred
a
she
was
silent
for
a
space
can
t
we
go
on
for
a
time
as
we
are
we
could
marry
on
three
hundred
a
year
but
it
means
a
very
little
house
there
s
smithie
s
brother
they
manage
on
two
hundred
and
fifty
but
that
s
very
little
she
says
they
have
a
house
almost
on
the
road
and
hardly
a
bit
of
garden
and
the
wall
to
is
so
thin
they
hear
everything
when
her
baby
cries
they
rap
and
people
stand
against
the
railings
and
talk
can
t
we
wait
you
re
doing
so
an
extraordinary
bitterness
possessed
me
at
this
invasion
of
the
stupendous
beautiful
business
of
love
by
sordid
necessity
i
answered
her
with
immense
restraint
if
i
said
we
could
have
a
detached
house
at
ealing
say
with
a
square
patch
of
lawn
in
front
and
a
garden
behind
and
and
a
tiled
that
would
be
sixty
pounds
a
year
at
which
means
five
hundred
a
year
yes
well
you
see
i
told
my
uncle
i
wanted
that
and
i
ve
got
got
what
five
hundred
pounds
a
five
hundred
pounds
i
burst
into
laughter
that
had
more
than
a
taste
of
bitterness
yes
i
said
really
and
now
what
do
you
think
yes
she
said
a
little
flushed
but
be
sensible
do
you
really
mean
you
ve
got
a
rise
all
at
once
of
two
hundred
a
year
to
marry
on
she
scrutinised
me
a
moment
you
ve
done
this
as
a
surprise
she
said
and
laughed
at
my
laughter
she
had
become
radiant
and
that
made
me
radiant
too
yes
i
said
yes
and
laughed
no
longer
bitterly
she
clasped
her
hands
and
looked
me
in
the
eyes
she
was
so
pleased
that
i
forgot
absolutely
my
disgust
of
a
moment
before
i
forgot
that
she
had
raised
her
price
two
hundred
pounds
a
year
and
that
i
had
bought
her
at
that
come
i
said
standing
up
let
s
go
towards
the
sunset
dear
and
talk
about
it
all
do
you
know
this
is
a
most
beautiful
world
an
amazingly
beautiful
world
and
when
the
sunset
falls
upon
you
it
makes
you
into
shining
gold
no
not
gold
into
golden
glass
into
something
better
that
either
glass
or
and
for
all
that
evening
i
wooed
her
and
kept
her
glad
she
made
me
repeat
my
assurances
over
again
and
still
doubted
a
little
we
furnished
that
house
from
attic
it
ran
to
an
attic
to
cellar
and
created
a
garden
do
you
know
pampas
grass
said
marion
i
love
pampas
grass
if
there
is
you
shall
have
pampas
grass
i
declared
and
there
were
moments
as
we
went
in
imagination
about
that
house
together
when
my
whole
being
cried
out
to
take
her
in
my
arms
now
but
i
refrained
on
that
aspect
of
life
i
touched
very
lightly
in
that
talk
very
lightly
because
i
had
had
my
lessons
she
promised
to
marry
me
within
two
months
time
shyly
reluctantly
she
named
a
day
and
next
afternoon
in
heat
and
wrath
we
broke
it
off
again
for
the
last
time
we
split
upon
procedure
i
refused
flatly
to
have
a
normal
wedding
with
wedding
cake
in
white
favours
carriages
and
the
rest
of
it
it
dawned
upon
me
suddenly
in
conversation
with
her
and
her
mother
that
this
was
implied
i
blurted
out
my
objection
forthwith
and
this
time
it
wasn
t
any
ordinary
difference
of
opinion
it
was
a
i
don
t
remember
a
quarter
of
the
things
we
flung
out
in
that
dispute
i
remember
her
mother
reiterating
in
tones
of
gentle
remonstrance
but
george
dear
you
must
have
a
cake
to
send
i
think
we
all
reiterated
things
i
seem
to
remember
a
refrain
of
my
own
a
marriage
is
too
sacred
a
thing
too
private
a
thing
for
this
display
her
father
came
in
and
stood
behind
me
against
the
wall
and
her
aunt
appeared
beside
the
sideboard
and
stood
with
arms
looking
from
speaker
to
speaker
a
sternly
gratified
prophetess
it
didn
t
occur
to
me
then
how
painful
it
was
to
marion
for
these
people
to
witness
my
rebellion
but
george
said
her
father
what
sort
of
marriage
do
you
want
you
don
t
want
to
go
to
one
of
those
there
registry
offices
that
s
exactly
what
i
d
like
to
do
marriage
is
too
private
a
thing
i
shouldn
t
feel
married
said
ramboat
look
here
marion
i
said
we
are
going
to
be
married
at
a
registry
office
i
don
t
believe
in
all
these
fripperies
and
superstitions
and
i
won
t
submit
to
them
i
ve
agreed
to
all
sorts
of
things
to
please
what
s
he
agreed
to
said
her
father
unheeded
i
can
t
marry
at
a
registry
office
said
marion
very
well
i
said
i
ll
marry
nowhere
i
can
t
marry
at
a
registry
very
well
i
said
standing
up
white
and
tense
and
it
amazed
me
but
i
was
also
exultant
then
we
won
t
marry
at
she
leant
forward
over
the
table
staring
blankly
but
presently
her
face
began
to
haunt
me
as
she
had
sat
at
the
table
and
her
arm
and
the
long
droop
of
her
shoulder
iii
the
next
day
i
did
an
unexampled
thing
i
sent
a
telegram
to
my
uncle
bad
temper
not
coming
to
business
and
set
off
for
highgate
and
ewart
he
was
actually
at
work
on
a
bust
of
millie
and
seemed
very
glad
for
any
interruption
ewart
you
old
fool
i
said
knock
off
and
come
for
a
day
s
gossip
i
m
rotten
there
s
a
sympathetic
sort
of
lunacy
about
you
let
s
go
to
staines
and
paddle
up
to
girl
said
ewart
putting
down
a
chisel
that
was
all
i
told
him
of
my
affair
i
ve
got
no
money
he
remarked
to
clear
up
ambiguity
in
my
invitation
we
got
a
jar
of
some
food
and
on
ewart
s
suggestion
two
japanese
sunshades
in
staines
we
demanded
extra
cushions
at
the
boathouse
and
we
spent
an
enormously
soothing
day
in
discourse
and
meditation
our
boat
moored
in
a
shady
place
this
side
of
windsor
i
seem
to
remember
ewart
with
a
cushion
forward
only
his
heels
and
sunshade
and
some
black
ends
of
hair
showing
a
voice
and
no
more
against
the
shining
mirror
of
the
trees
and
bushes
it
s
not
worth
it
was
the
burthen
of
the
voice
you
d
better
get
yourself
a
millie
ponderevo
and
then
you
wouldn
t
feel
so
no
i
said
decidedly
that
s
not
my
a
thread
of
smoke
ascended
from
ewart
for
a
while
like
smoke
from
an
altar
everything
s
a
muddle
and
you
think
it
isn
t
nobody
knows
where
we
are
because
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
aren
t
anywhere
are
women
property
or
are
they
or
a
sort
of
proprietary
goddesses
they
re
so
obviously
you
believe
in
the
goddess
no
i
said
that
s
not
my
what
is
your
idea
well
h
m
said
ewart
in
my
pause
my
idea
i
said
is
to
meet
one
person
who
will
belong
to
me
to
whom
i
shall
belong
body
and
soul
no
wait
till
she
comes
if
she
comes
at
all
we
must
come
to
each
other
young
and
there
s
no
such
thing
as
a
pure
person
or
an
impure
person
mixed
to
begin
this
was
so
manifestly
true
that
it
silenced
me
altogether
and
if
you
belong
to
her
and
she
to
you
ponderevo
which
end
s
the
head
i
made
no
answer
except
an
impatient
oh
for
a
time
we
smoked
in
silence
did
i
tell
you
ponderevo
of
a
wonderful
discovery
i
ve
made
ewart
began
presently
no
i
said
what
is
it
there
s
no
no
no
practically
not
i
ve
just
thought
all
that
business
out
she
s
merely
an
instrument
ponderevo
she
s
borne
the
blame
grundy
s
a
man
grundy
unmasked
rather
lean
and
out
of
sorts
early
middle
age
with
bunchy
black
whiskers
and
a
worried
eye
been
good
so
far
and
it
s
fretting
him
moods
there
s
grundy
in
a
state
of
sexual
panic
for
example
for
god
s
sake
cover
it
up
they
get
together
they
get
together
it
s
too
exciting
the
most
dreadful
things
are
happening
rushing
about
long
arms
going
like
a
windmill
they
must
be
kept
apart
starts
out
for
an
absolute
obliteration
of
everything
absolute
separations
one
side
of
the
road
for
men
and
the
other
for
women
and
a
hoarding
without
posters
between
them
every
boy
and
girl
to
be
sewed
up
in
a
sack
and
sealed
just
the
head
and
hands
and
feet
out
until
music
abolished
calico
garments
for
the
lower
animals
sparrows
to
be
suppressed
i
laughed
abruptly
well
that
s
grundy
in
one
mood
and
it
puts
grundy
she
s
a
person
ponderevo
a
rake
at
heart
and
it
puts
her
in
a
most
painful
state
of
fluster
most
painful
she
s
an
amenable
creature
when
grundy
tells
her
things
are
shocking
she
s
shocked
pink
and
breathless
she
goes
about
trying
to
conceal
her
profound
sense
of
guilt
behind
a
haughty
expression
grundy
meanwhile
is
in
a
state
of
complete
whirlabout
long
lean
knuckly
hands
pointing
and
gesticulating
they
re
still
thinking
of
things
thinking
of
things
it
s
dreadful
they
get
it
out
of
books
i
can
t
imagine
where
they
get
it
i
must
watch
there
re
people
over
there
whispering
nobody
ought
to
whisper
there
s
something
suggestive
in
the
mere
act
then
pictures
in
the
museum
things
too
dreadful
for
words
why
can
t
we
have
pure
art
with
the
anatomy
all
wrong
and
pure
and
nice
and
pure
fiction
pure
poetry
instead
of
all
this
stuff
with
allusions
allusions
excuse
me
there
s
something
up
behind
that
locked
door
the
keyhole
in
the
interests
of
public
morality
yes
sir
as
a
pure
good
man
i
insist
i
ll
look
it
won
t
hurt
me
i
insist
on
looking
my
duty
m
m
m
the
keyhole
he
kicked
his
legs
about
extravagantly
and
i
laughed
again
that
s
grundy
in
one
mood
ponderevo
it
isn
t
grundy
that
s
one
of
the
lies
we
tell
about
women
they
re
too
simple
simple
woman
are
simple
they
take
on
just
what
men
tell
ewart
meditated
for
a
space
just
exactly
as
it
s
put
to
them
he
said
and
resumed
the
moods
of
grundy
then
you
get
old
grundy
in
another
mood
ever
caught
him
nosing
ponderevo
mad
with
the
idea
of
mysterious
unknown
wicked
delicious
things
things
that
aren
t
respectable
wow
things
he
mustn
t
do
any
one
who
knows
about
these
things
knows
there
s
just
as
much
mystery
and
deliciousness
about
grundy
s
forbidden
things
as
there
is
about
eating
ham
jolly
nice
if
it
s
a
bright
morning
and
you
re
well
and
hungry
and
having
breakfast
in
the
open
air
jolly
unattractive
if
you
re
off
colour
but
grundy
s
covered
it
all
up
and
hidden
it
and
put
mucky
shades
and
covers
over
it
until
he
s
forgotten
it
begins
to
fester
round
it
in
his
mind
has
dreadful
struggles
with
himself
about
impure
thoughts
then
you
set
grundy
with
hot
ears
curious
in
undertones
grundy
on
the
loose
grundy
in
a
hoarse
whisper
and
with
furtive
eyes
and
convulsive
movements
making
things
indecent
evolving
in
dense
vapours
indecency
grundy
sins
oh
yes
he
s
a
hypocrite
sneaks
round
a
corner
and
sins
ugly
it
s
grundy
and
his
dark
corners
that
make
vice
vice
we
artists
we
have
no
vices
and
then
he
s
frantic
with
repentance
and
wants
to
be
cruel
to
fallen
women
and
decent
harmless
sculptors
of
the
simple
nude
like
me
and
so
back
to
his
panic
mrs
grundy
i
suppose
doesn
t
know
he
sins
i
remarked
no
i
m
not
so
sure
but
bless
her
heart
she
s
a
woman
she
s
a
woman
then
again
you
get
grundy
with
a
large
greasy
smile
like
an
accident
to
a
butter
tub
all
over
his
face
being
liberal
minded
grundy
in
his
moments
trying
not
to
see
harm
in
it
grundy
the
friend
of
innocent
pleasure
he
makes
you
sick
with
the
harm
he
s
trying
not
to
see
in
it
and
that
s
why
everything
s
wrong
ponderevo
grundy
damn
him
stands
in
the
light
and
we
young
people
can
t
see
his
moods
affect
us
we
catch
his
gusts
of
panic
his
disease
of
nosing
his
greasiness
we
don
t
know
what
we
may
think
what
we
may
say
he
does
his
silly
utmost
to
prevent
our
reading
and
seeing
the
one
thing
the
one
sort
of
discussion
we
find
quite
naturally
and
properly
supremely
interesting
so
we
don
t
adolescence
we
blunder
up
to
sex
dare
dare
to
look
and
he
may
dirt
you
for
ever
the
girls
are
to
silence
by
his
significant
whiskers
by
the
bleary
something
in
his
suddenly
ewart
with
an
almost
effect
sat
up
he
s
about
us
everywhere
ponderevo
he
said
very
solemnly
sometimes
sometimes
i
think
he
is
in
our
blood
in
he
regarded
me
for
my
opinion
very
earnestly
with
his
pipe
in
the
corner
of
his
mouth
you
re
the
remotest
cousin
he
ever
had
i
said
i
reflected
look
here
ewart
i
asked
how
would
you
have
things
different
he
wrinkled
up
his
queer
face
regarded
the
wait
and
made
his
pipe
gurgle
for
a
space
thinking
deeply
there
are
complications
i
admit
we
ve
grown
up
under
the
terror
of
grundy
and
that
innocent
but
docile
and
yes
formidable
lady
his
wife
i
don
t
know
how
far
the
complications
aren
t
a
disease
a
sort
of
bleaching
under
the
grundy
shadow
it
is
possible
there
are
things
i
have
still
to
learn
about
women
man
has
eaten
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
his
innocence
is
gone
you
can
t
have
your
cake
and
eat
it
we
re
in
for
knowledge
let
s
have
it
plain
and
straight
i
should
begin
i
think
by
abolishing
the
ideas
of
decency
and
indecency
grundy
would
have
fits
i
injected
grundy
ponderevo
would
have
cold
douches
publicly
if
the
sight
was
not
too
painful
three
times
a
day
but
i
don
t
think
mind
you
that
i
should
let
the
sexes
run
about
together
no
the
fact
behind
the
sexes
is
sex
it
s
no
good
humbugging
it
trails
about
even
in
the
best
mixed
company
tugs
at
your
ankle
the
men
get
showing
off
and
quarrelling
and
the
women
or
they
re
bored
i
suppose
the
ancestral
males
have
competed
for
the
ancestral
females
ever
since
they
were
both
some
sort
of
grubby
little
reptile
you
aren
t
going
to
alter
that
in
a
thousand
years
or
so
never
should
you
have
a
mixed
company
never
except
with
only
one
man
or
only
one
woman
how
would
that
be
or
duets
only
how
to
manage
it
some
rule
of
etiquette
he
became
portentously
grave
then
his
long
hand
went
out
in
weird
gestures
i
seem
to
see
i
seem
to
see
a
sort
of
city
of
women
ponderevo
yes
a
walled
enclosure
good
s
work
a
city
wall
high
as
the
walls
of
rome
going
about
a
garden
dozens
of
square
miles
of
garden
trees
fountains
arbours
lakes
lawns
on
which
the
women
play
avenues
in
which
they
gossip
boats
women
like
that
sort
of
thing
any
woman
who
s
been
to
a
good
eventful
girls
school
lives
on
the
memory
of
it
for
the
rest
of
her
life
it
s
one
of
the
pathetic
things
about
women
the
superiority
of
school
and
college
to
anything
they
get
afterwards
and
this
of
women
will
have
beautiful
places
for
music
places
for
beautiful
dresses
places
for
beautiful
work
everything
a
woman
can
want
nurseries
kindergartens
schools
and
no
man
except
to
do
rough
work
perhaps
ever
comes
in
the
men
live
in
a
world
where
they
can
hunt
and
engineer
invent
and
mine
and
manufacture
sail
ships
drink
deep
and
practice
the
arts
and
fight
yes
i
said
but
he
stilled
me
with
a
gesture
i
m
coming
to
that
the
homes
of
the
women
ponderevo
will
be
set
in
the
wall
of
their
city
each
woman
will
have
her
own
particular
house
and
home
furnished
after
her
own
heart
in
her
own
manner
with
a
little
balcony
on
the
outside
wall
built
into
the
wall
and
a
little
balcony
and
there
she
will
go
and
look
out
when
the
mood
takes
her
and
all
round
the
city
there
will
be
a
broad
road
and
seats
and
great
shady
trees
and
men
will
stroll
up
and
down
there
when
they
feel
the
need
of
feminine
company
when
for
instance
they
want
to
talk
about
their
souls
or
their
characters
or
any
of
the
things
that
only
women
will
stand
the
women
will
lean
over
and
look
at
the
men
and
smile
and
talk
to
them
as
they
fancy
and
each
woman
will
have
this
she
will
have
a
little
silken
ladder
she
can
let
down
if
she
chooses
if
she
wants
to
talk
closer
the
men
would
still
be
there
perhaps
yes
but
they
d
have
to
abide
by
the
women
s
i
raised
one
or
two
difficulties
and
for
a
while
we
played
with
this
idea
ewart
i
said
this
is
like
doll
s
island
suppose
i
reflected
an
unsuccessful
man
laid
siege
to
a
balcony
and
wouldn
t
let
his
rival
come
near
it
move
him
on
said
ewart
by
a
special
regulation
as
one
does
no
difficulty
about
that
and
you
could
forbid
it
make
it
against
the
etiquette
no
life
is
decent
without
etiquette
and
people
obey
etiquette
sooner
than
laws
h
m
i
said
and
was
struck
by
an
idea
that
is
remote
in
the
world
of
a
young
man
how
about
children
i
asked
in
the
city
girls
are
all
very
well
but
boys
for
example
grow
ah
said
ewart
yes
i
forgot
they
mustn
t
grow
up
inside
they
d
turn
out
the
boys
when
they
were
seven
the
father
must
come
with
a
little
pony
and
a
little
gun
and
manly
wear
and
take
the
boy
away
then
one
could
come
afterwards
to
one
s
mother
s
balcony
it
must
be
fine
to
have
a
mother
the
father
and
the
son
this
is
all
very
pretty
in
its
way
i
said
at
last
but
it
s
a
dream
let
s
come
back
to
reality
what
i
want
to
know
is
what
are
you
going
to
do
in
brompton
let
us
say
or
walham
green
now
oh
damn
it
he
remarked
walham
green
what
a
chap
you
are
ponderevo
and
he
made
an
abrupt
end
to
his
discourse
he
wouldn
t
even
reply
to
my
tentatives
for
a
time
while
i
was
talking
just
now
he
remarked
presently
i
had
a
quite
different
what
for
a
masterpiece
a
series
like
the
busts
of
the
caesars
only
not
heads
you
know
we
don
t
see
the
people
who
do
things
to
us
nowadays
how
will
you
do
it
then
hands
a
series
of
hands
the
hands
of
the
twentieth
century
i
ll
do
it
some
day
some
one
will
discover
it
go
there
see
what
i
have
done
and
what
is
meant
by
see
it
where
on
the
tombs
why
not
the
unknown
master
of
the
highgate
slope
all
the
little
soft
feminine
hands
the
nervous
ugly
males
the
hands
of
the
flops
and
the
hands
of
the
snatchers
and
grundy
s
loose
lean
knuckly
affair
grundy
the
terror
the
little
wrinkles
and
the
thumb
only
it
ought
to
hold
all
the
others
together
in
a
slightly
disturbing
squeeze
rodin
s
great
hand
you
know
the
thing
iv
i
forget
how
many
days
intervened
between
that
last
breaking
off
of
our
engagement
and
marion
s
surrender
but
i
recall
now
the
sharpness
of
my
emotion
the
concentrated
spirit
of
tears
and
laughter
in
my
throat
as
i
read
the
words
of
her
unexpected
letter
i
have
thought
over
everything
and
i
was
selfish
i
rushed
off
to
walham
green
that
evening
to
give
back
all
she
had
given
me
to
beat
her
altogether
at
giving
she
was
extraordinarily
gentle
and
generous
that
time
i
remember
and
when
at
last
i
left
her
she
kissed
me
very
sweetly
so
we
were
married
we
were
married
with
all
the
customary
incongruity
i
gave
perhaps
after
a
while
not
altogether
ungrudgingly
and
what
i
gave
marion
took
with
a
manifest
satisfaction
after
all
i
was
being
sensible
so
that
we
had
three
livery
carriages
to
the
church
one
of
the
pairs
of
horses
matched
and
coachmen
with
improvised
flavour
and
very
shabby
silk
hats
bearing
white
favours
on
their
whips
and
my
uncle
intervened
with
splendour
and
insisted
upon
having
a
wedding
breakfast
sent
in
from
a
caterer
s
in
hammersmith
the
table
had
a
great
display
of
chrysanthemums
and
there
was
orange
blossom
in
the
significant
place
and
a
wonderful
cake
we
also
circulated
upwards
of
a
score
of
wedges
of
that
accompanied
by
cards
in
which
marion
s
name
of
ramboat
was
stricken
out
by
an
arrow
in
favour
of
ponderevo
we
had
a
little
rally
of
marion
s
relations
and
several
friends
and
friends
friends
from
smithie
s
appeared
in
the
church
and
drifted
i
produced
my
aunt
and
uncle
a
select
group
of
two
the
effect
in
that
shabby
little
house
was
one
of
exhilarating
congestion
the
in
which
lived
the
and
the
apartments
card
was
used
for
a
display
of
the
presents
eked
out
by
the
unused
balance
of
the
cards
marion
wore
the
white
raiment
of
a
bride
white
silk
and
satin
that
did
not
suit
her
that
made
her
seem
large
and
strange
to
me
she
obtruded
bows
and
unfamiliar
contours
she
went
through
all
this
strange
ritual
of
an
english
wedding
with
a
sacramental
gravity
that
i
was
altogether
too
young
and
egotistical
to
comprehend
it
was
all
extraordinarily
central
and
important
to
her
it
was
no
more
than
an
offensive
complicated
and
disconcerting
intrusion
of
a
world
i
was
already
beginning
to
criticise
very
bitterly
to
me
what
was
all
this
fuss
for
the
mere
indecent
advertisement
that
i
had
been
passionately
in
love
with
marion
i
think
however
that
marion
was
only
very
remotely
aware
of
my
smouldering
exasperation
at
having
in
the
end
behaved
i
had
played
up
to
the
extent
of
dressing
my
part
i
had
an
admirably
cut
frock
coat
a
new
silk
hat
trousers
as
light
as
i
could
endure
them
lighter
in
fact
a
white
waistcoat
night
tie
light
gloves
marion
seeing
me
despondent
had
the
unusual
enterprise
to
whisper
to
me
that
i
looked
lovely
i
knew
too
well
i
didn
t
look
myself
i
looked
like
a
special
coloured
supplement
to
men
s
wear
or
the
tailor
and
cutter
full
dress
for
ceremonial
occasions
i
had
even
the
disconcerting
sensations
of
an
unfamiliar
collar
i
felt
lost
in
a
strange
body
and
when
i
glanced
down
myself
for
reassurance
the
straight
white
abdomen
the
alien
legs
confirmed
that
impression
my
uncle
was
my
best
man
and
looked
like
a
banker
a
little
banker
in
flower
he
wore
a
white
rose
in
his
buttonhole
he
wasn
t
i
think
particularly
talkative
at
least
i
recall
very
little
from
him
george
he
said
once
or
twice
this
is
a
great
occasion
for
you
a
very
great
he
spoke
a
little
doubtfully
you
see
i
had
told
him
nothing
about
marion
until
about
a
week
before
the
wedding
both
he
and
my
aunt
had
been
taken
altogether
by
surprise
they
couldn
t
as
people
say
make
it
my
aunt
was
intensely
interested
much
more
than
my
uncle
it
was
then
i
think
for
the
first
time
that
i
really
saw
that
she
cared
for
me
she
got
me
alone
i
remember
after
i
had
made
my
announcement
now
george
she
said
tell
me
everything
about
her
why
didn
t
you
tell
me
at
least
before
i
was
surprised
to
find
how
difficult
it
was
to
tell
her
about
marion
i
perplexed
her
then
is
she
beautiful
she
asked
at
last
i
don
t
know
what
you
ll
think
of
her
i
parried
i
think
yes
i
think
she
might
be
the
most
beautiful
person
in
the
and
isn
t
she
to
you
of
course
i
said
nodding
my
head
yes
she
is
and
while
i
don
t
remember
anything
my
uncle
said
or
did
at
the
wedding
i
do
remember
very
distinctly
certain
little
things
scrutiny
solicitude
a
curious
rare
flash
of
intimacy
in
my
aunt
s
eyes
it
dawned
on
me
that
i
wasn
t
hiding
anything
from
her
at
all
she
was
dressed
very
smartly
wearing
a
hat
that
made
her
neck
seem
longer
and
slenderer
than
ever
and
when
she
walked
up
the
aisle
with
that
rolling
stride
of
hers
and
her
eye
all
on
marion
perplexed
into
it
wasn
t
somehow
funny
she
was
i
do
believe
giving
my
marriage
more
thought
than
i
had
done
she
was
concerned
beyond
measure
at
my
black
rage
and
marion
s
blindness
she
was
looking
with
eyes
that
knew
what
loving
is
for
love
in
the
vestry
she
turned
away
as
we
signed
and
i
verily
believe
she
was
crying
though
to
this
day
i
can
t
say
why
she
should
have
cried
and
she
was
near
crying
too
when
she
squeezed
my
hand
at
parting
and
she
never
said
a
word
or
looked
at
me
but
just
squeezed
my
hand
if
i
had
not
been
so
grim
in
spirit
i
think
i
should
have
found
much
of
my
wedding
amusing
i
remember
a
lot
of
ridiculous
detail
that
still
declines
to
be
funny
in
my
memory
the
officiating
clergyman
had
a
cold
and
turned
his
n
s
to
d
s
and
he
made
the
most
mechanical
compliment
conceivable
about
the
bride
s
age
when
the
register
was
signed
every
bride
he
had
ever
married
had
had
it
one
knew
and
two
spinsters
cousins
of
marion
s
and
dressmakers
at
barking
stand
out
they
wore
marvellously
bright
and
gay
blouses
and
dim
old
skirts
and
had
an
immense
respect
for
ramboat
they
threw
rice
they
brought
a
whole
bag
with
them
and
gave
handfuls
away
to
unknown
little
boys
at
the
church
door
and
so
created
a
lilliputian
riot
and
one
had
meant
to
throw
a
slipper
it
was
a
very
warm
old
silk
slipper
i
know
because
she
dropped
it
out
of
a
pocket
in
the
aisle
there
was
a
sort
of
jumble
in
the
aisle
and
i
picked
it
up
for
her
i
don
t
think
she
actually
threw
it
for
as
we
drove
away
from
the
church
i
saw
her
in
a
dreadful
and
it
seemed
to
me
hopeless
struggle
with
her
pocket
and
afterwards
my
eye
caught
the
missile
of
good
fortune
lying
it
or
its
fellow
most
obviously
mislaid
behind
the
in
the
hall
the
whole
business
was
much
more
absurd
more
incoherent
more
human
than
i
had
anticipated
but
i
was
far
too
young
and
serious
to
let
the
latter
quality
atone
for
its
shortcomings
i
am
so
remote
from
this
phase
of
my
youth
that
i
can
look
back
at
it
all
as
dispassionately
as
one
looks
at
a
picture
at
some
wonderful
perfect
sort
of
picture
that
is
inexhaustible
but
at
the
time
these
things
filled
me
with
unspeakable
resentment
now
i
go
round
it
all
look
into
its
details
generalise
about
its
aspects
i
m
interested
for
example
to
square
it
with
my
bladesover
theory
of
the
british
social
scheme
under
stress
of
tradition
we
were
all
of
us
trying
in
the
fermenting
chaos
of
london
to
carry
out
the
marriage
ceremonies
of
a
bladesover
tenant
or
one
of
the
chubby
middling
sort
of
people
in
some
dependent
country
town
there
a
marriage
is
a
public
function
with
a
public
significance
there
the
church
is
to
a
large
extent
the
of
the
community
and
your
going
to
be
married
a
thing
of
importance
to
every
one
you
pass
on
the
road
it
is
a
change
of
status
that
quite
legitimately
interests
the
whole
neighbourhood
but
in
london
there
are
no
neighbours
nobody
knows
nobody
cares
an
absolute
stranger
in
an
office
took
my
notice
and
our
banns
were
proclaimed
to
ears
that
had
never
previously
heard
our
names
the
clergyman
even
who
married
us
had
never
seen
us
before
and
didn
t
in
any
degree
intimate
that
he
wanted
to
see
us
again
neighbours
in
london
the
ramboats
did
not
know
the
names
of
the
people
on
either
side
of
them
as
i
waited
for
marion
before
we
started
off
upon
our
honeymoon
flight
ramboat
i
remember
came
and
stood
beside
me
and
stared
out
of
the
window
there
was
a
funeral
over
there
yesterday
he
said
by
way
of
making
conversation
and
moved
his
head
at
the
house
opposite
quite
a
smart
affair
it
was
with
a
glass
earse
and
our
little
procession
of
three
carriages
with
horses
and
drivers
went
through
all
the
huge
noisy
indifferent
traffic
like
a
lost
china
image
in
the
of
an
ironclad
nobody
made
way
for
us
nobody
cared
for
us
the
driver
of
an
omnibus
jeered
for
a
long
time
we
crawled
behind
an
unamiable
the
irrelevant
clatter
and
tumult
gave
a
queer
flavour
of
indecency
to
this
public
coming
together
of
lovers
we
seemed
to
have
obtruded
ourselves
shamelessly
the
crowd
that
gathered
outside
the
church
would
have
gathered
in
the
same
spirit
and
with
greater
alacrity
for
a
street
accident
at
charing
cross
we
were
going
to
hastings
the
experienced
eye
of
the
guard
detected
the
significance
of
our
unusual
costume
and
he
secured
us
a
compartment
well
said
i
as
the
train
moved
out
of
the
station
that
s
all
over
and
i
turned
to
marion
a
little
unfamiliar
still
in
her
unfamiliar
clothes
and
smiled
she
regarded
me
gravely
timidly
you
re
not
cross
she
asked
cross
why
at
having
it
all
my
dear
marion
said
i
and
by
way
of
answer
took
and
kissed
her
hand
i
don
t
remember
much
else
about
the
journey
an
hour
or
so
it
was
of
undistinguished
time
for
we
were
both
confused
and
a
little
fatigued
and
marion
had
a
slight
headache
and
did
not
want
caresses
i
fell
into
a
reverie
about
my
aunt
and
realised
as
if
it
were
a
new
discovery
that
i
cared
for
her
very
greatly
i
was
acutely
sorry
i
had
not
told
her
earlier
of
my
marriage
but
you
will
not
want
to
hear
the
history
of
my
honeymoon
i
have
told
all
that
was
needed
to
serve
my
present
purpose
thus
and
thus
it
was
the
will
in
things
had
its
way
with
me
driven
by
forces
i
did
not
understand
diverted
altogether
from
the
science
the
curiosities
and
work
to
which
i
had
once
given
myself
i
fought
my
way
through
a
tangle
of
traditions
customs
obstacles
and
absurdities
enraged
myself
limited
myself
gave
myself
to
occupations
i
saw
with
the
clearest
vision
were
dishonourable
and
vain
and
at
last
achieved
the
end
of
purblind
nature
the
relentless
immediacy
of
her
desire
and
held
far
short
of
happiness
marion
weeping
and
reluctant
in
my
arms
v
who
can
tell
the
story
of
the
slow
estrangement
of
two
married
people
the
weakening
of
first
this
bond
and
then
that
of
that
complex
contact
least
of
all
can
one
of
the
two
participants
even
now
with
an
interval
of
fifteen
years
to
clear
it
up
for
me
i
still
find
a
mass
of
impressions
of
marion
as
confused
as
discordant
as
unsystematic
and
as
life
i
think
of
this
thing
and
love
her
of
that
and
hate
her
of
a
hundred
aspects
in
which
i
can
now
see
her
with
an
unimpassioned
sympathy
as
i
sit
here
trying
to
render
some
vision
of
this
infinitely
confused
process
i
recall
moments
of
hard
and
fierce
estrangement
moments
of
clouded
intimacy
the
passage
of
transition
all
forgotten
we
talked
a
little
language
together
whence
were
friends
and
i
was
mutney
and
she
was
ming
and
we
kept
up
such
an
outward
show
that
till
the
very
end
smithie
thought
our
household
the
most
amiable
in
the
world
i
can
not
tell
to
the
full
how
marion
thwarted
me
and
failed
in
that
life
of
intimate
emotions
which
is
the
kernel
of
love
that
life
of
intimate
emotions
is
made
up
of
little
things
a
beautiful
face
differs
from
an
ugly
one
by
a
difference
of
surfaces
and
proportions
that
are
sometimes
almost
infinitesimally
small
i
find
myself
setting
down
little
things
and
little
things
none
of
them
do
more
than
demonstrate
those
essential
temperamental
discords
i
have
already
sought
to
make
clear
some
readers
will
understand
to
others
i
shall
seem
no
more
than
an
unfeeling
brute
who
couldn
t
make
allowances
it
s
easy
to
make
allowances
now
but
to
be
young
and
ardent
and
to
make
allowances
to
see
one
s
married
life
open
before
one
the
life
that
seemed
in
its
dawn
a
glory
a
garden
of
roses
a
place
of
deep
sweet
mysteries
and
heart
throbs
and
wonderful
silences
and
to
see
it
a
vista
of
tolerations
and
a
compromise
the
least
effectual
thing
in
all
one
s
life
every
love
romance
i
read
seemed
to
mock
our
dull
intercourse
every
poem
every
beautiful
picture
reflected
upon
the
uneventful
succession
of
grey
hours
we
had
together
i
think
our
real
difference
was
one
of
aesthetic
sensibility
i
do
still
recall
as
the
worst
and
most
disastrous
aspect
of
all
that
time
her
absolute
disregard
of
her
own
beauty
it
s
the
pettiest
thing
to
record
i
know
but
she
could
wear
in
my
presence
it
was
her
idea
too
to
wear
out
her
old
clothes
and
her
failures
at
home
when
no
one
was
likely
to
see
her
no
one
being
myself
she
allowed
me
to
accumulate
a
store
of
ungracious
and
slovenly
memories
all
our
conceptions
of
life
differed
i
remember
how
we
differed
about
furniture
we
spent
three
or
four
days
in
tottenham
court
road
and
she
chose
the
things
she
fancied
with
an
inexorable
resolution
sweeping
aside
my
suggestions
with
oh
you
want
such
queer
she
pursued
some
limited
clearly
seen
and
experienced
ideal
that
excluded
all
other
possibilities
over
every
mantel
was
a
mirror
that
was
draped
our
sideboard
was
wonderfully
good
and
splendid
with
beveled
glass
we
had
lamps
on
long
metal
stalks
and
cozy
corners
and
plants
in
smithie
approved
it
all
there
wasn
t
a
place
where
one
could
sit
and
read
in
the
whole
house
my
books
went
upon
shelves
in
the
recess
and
we
had
a
piano
though
marion
s
playing
was
at
an
elementary
level
you
know
it
was
the
cruelest
luck
for
marion
that
i
with
my
restlessness
my
scepticism
my
constantly
developing
ideas
had
insisted
on
marriage
with
her
she
had
no
faculty
of
growth
or
change
she
had
taken
her
mould
she
had
set
in
the
limited
ideas
of
her
peculiar
class
she
preserved
her
conception
of
what
was
right
in
chairs
and
in
marriage
ceremonial
and
in
every
relation
of
life
with
a
simple
and
luminous
honesty
and
conviction
with
an
immense
unimaginative
inflexibility
as
a
builds
its
nest
or
a
beaver
makes
its
dam
let
me
hasten
over
this
history
of
disappointments
and
separation
i
might
tell
of
waxings
and
waning
of
love
between
us
but
the
whole
was
waning
sometimes
she
would
do
things
for
me
make
me
a
tie
or
a
pair
of
slippers
and
fill
me
with
none
the
less
gratitude
because
the
things
were
absurd
she
ran
our
home
and
our
one
servant
with
a
hard
bright
efficiency
she
was
inordinately
proud
of
house
and
garden
always
by
her
lights
she
did
her
duty
by
me
presently
the
rapid
development
of
began
to
take
me
into
the
provinces
and
i
would
be
away
sometimes
for
a
week
together
this
she
did
not
like
it
left
her
dull
she
said
but
after
a
time
she
began
to
go
to
smithie
s
again
and
to
develop
an
independence
of
me
at
smithie
s
she
was
now
a
woman
with
a
position
she
had
money
to
spend
she
would
take
smithie
to
theatres
and
out
to
lunch
and
talk
interminably
of
the
business
and
smithie
became
a
sort
of
permanent
weekender
with
us
also
marion
got
a
spaniel
and
began
to
dabble
with
the
minor
arts
with
and
a
kodak
and
hyacinths
in
glasses
she
called
once
on
a
neighbour
her
parents
left
walham
green
her
father
severed
his
connection
with
the
and
came
to
live
in
a
small
house
i
took
for
them
near
us
and
they
were
much
with
us
odd
the
littleness
of
the
things
that
exasperate
when
the
fountains
of
life
are
embittered
my
was
perpetually
catching
me
in
moody
moments
and
urging
me
to
take
to
gardening
he
irritated
me
beyond
measure
you
think
too
much
he
would
say
if
you
was
to
let
in
a
bit
with
a
spade
you
might
soon
ave
that
garden
of
yours
a
vision
of
flowers
that
s
better
than
thinking
or
in
a
torrent
of
exasperation
i
carn
t
think
george
why
you
don
t
get
a
bit
of
glass
ere
this
sunny
corner
you
c
d
do
wonders
with
a
bit
of
and
in
the
summer
time
he
never
came
in
without
performing
a
sort
of
conjuring
trick
in
the
hall
and
taking
cucumbers
and
tomatoes
from
unexpected
points
of
his
person
all
out
o
my
little
bit
he
d
say
in
exemplary
tones
he
left
a
trail
of
vegetable
produce
in
the
most
unusual
places
on
mantel
boards
sideboards
the
tops
of
pictures
heavens
how
the
sudden
unexpected
tomato
could
annoy
me
it
did
much
to
widen
our
estrangement
that
marion
and
my
aunt
failed
to
make
friends
became
by
a
sort
of
instinct
antagonistic
my
aunt
to
begin
with
called
rather
frequently
for
she
was
really
anxious
to
know
marion
at
first
she
would
arrive
like
a
whirlwind
and
pervade
the
house
with
an
atmosphere
of
hello
she
dressed
already
with
that
cheerfully
extravagant
abandon
that
signalised
her
accession
to
fortune
and
dressed
her
best
for
these
visits
she
wanted
to
play
the
mother
to
me
i
fancy
to
tell
marion
occult
secrets
about
the
way
i
wore
out
my
boots
and
how
i
never
could
think
to
put
on
thicker
things
in
cold
weather
but
marion
received
her
with
that
defensive
suspiciousness
of
the
shy
person
thinking
only
of
the
possible
criticism
of
herself
and
my
aunt
perceiving
this
became
nervous
and
slangy
she
says
such
queer
things
said
marion
once
discussing
her
but
i
suppose
it
s
yes
i
said
it
is
if
i
said
things
like
she
does
the
queer
things
my
aunt
said
were
nothing
to
the
queer
things
she
didn
t
say
i
remember
her
in
our
one
day
and
how
she
cocked
her
eye
it
s
the
only
expression
at
the
plant
in
a
pot
which
marion
had
placed
on
the
corner
of
the
piano
she
was
on
the
very
verge
of
speech
then
suddenly
she
caught
my
expression
and
shrank
up
like
a
cat
that
has
been
discovered
looking
at
the
milk
then
a
wicked
impulse
took
her
didn
t
say
an
old
word
george
she
insisted
looking
me
full
in
the
eye
i
smiled
you
re
a
dear
i
said
not
to
as
marion
came
lowering
into
the
room
to
welcome
her
but
i
felt
extraordinarily
like
a
traitor
to
the
plant
i
suppose
for
all
that
nothing
had
been
said
your
aunt
makes
game
of
people
was
marion
s
verdict
and
i
suppose
it
s
all
right
for
several
times
we
went
to
the
house
in
beckenham
for
lunch
and
once
or
twice
to
dinner
my
aunt
did
her
peculiar
best
to
be
friends
but
marion
was
implacable
she
was
also
i
know
intensely
uncomfortable
and
she
adopted
as
her
social
method
an
exhausting
silence
replying
compactly
and
without
giving
openings
to
anything
that
was
said
to
her
the
gaps
between
my
aunt
s
visits
grew
wider
and
wider
my
married
existence
became
at
last
like
a
narrow
deep
groove
in
the
broad
expanse
of
interests
in
which
i
was
living
i
went
about
the
world
i
met
a
great
number
of
varied
personalities
i
read
endless
books
in
trains
as
i
went
to
and
fro
i
developed
social
relationships
at
my
uncle
s
house
that
marion
did
not
share
the
seeds
of
new
ideas
poured
in
upon
me
and
grew
in
me
those
early
and
middle
years
of
one
s
third
decade
are
i
suppose
for
a
man
the
years
of
greatest
mental
growth
they
are
restless
years
and
full
of
vague
enterprise
each
time
i
returned
to
ealing
life
there
seemed
more
alien
narrow
and
unattractive
and
marion
less
beautiful
and
more
limited
and
difficult
until
at
last
she
was
robbed
of
every
particle
of
her
magic
she
gave
me
always
a
cooler
welcome
i
think
until
she
seemed
entirely
apathetic
i
never
asked
myself
then
what
heartaches
she
might
hide
or
what
her
discontents
might
be
i
would
come
home
hoping
nothing
expecting
nothing
this
was
my
fated
life
and
i
had
chosen
it
i
became
more
sensitive
to
the
defects
i
had
once
disregarded
altogether
i
began
to
associate
her
sallow
complexion
with
her
temperamental
insufficiency
and
the
heavier
lines
of
her
mouth
and
nostril
with
her
moods
of
discontent
we
drifted
apart
wider
and
wider
the
gap
opened
i
tired
of
and
stereotyped
little
fondlings
i
tired
of
the
latest
intelligence
from
those
wonderful
workrooms
and
showed
it
all
too
plainly
we
hardly
spoke
when
we
were
alone
together
the
mere
unreciprocated
physical
residue
of
my
passion
remained
an
exasperation
between
us
no
children
came
to
save
us
marion
had
acquired
at
smithie
s
a
disgust
and
dread
of
maternity
all
that
was
the
fruition
and
quintessence
of
the
horrid
elements
in
life
a
disgusting
thing
a
last
indignity
that
overtook
unwary
women
i
doubt
indeed
a
little
if
children
would
have
saved
us
we
should
have
differed
so
fatally
about
their
upbringing
altogether
i
remember
my
life
with
marion
as
a
long
distress
now
hard
now
tender
it
was
in
those
days
that
i
first
became
critical
of
my
life
and
burdened
with
a
sense
of
error
and
maladjustment
i
would
lie
awake
in
the
night
asking
myself
the
purpose
of
things
reviewing
my
unsatisfying
ungainly
my
days
spent
in
rascal
enterprise
and
contrasting
all
i
was
being
and
doing
with
my
adolescent
ambitions
my
wimblehurst
dreams
my
circumstances
had
an
air
of
finality
and
i
asked
myself
in
vain
why
i
had
forced
myself
into
them
vi
the
end
of
our
intolerable
situation
came
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
but
in
a
way
that
i
suppose
was
almost
inevitable
my
alienated
affections
wandered
and
i
was
unfaithful
to
marion
i
won
t
pretend
to
extenuate
the
quality
of
my
conduct
i
was
a
young
and
fairly
vigorous
male
all
my
appetite
for
love
had
been
roused
and
whetted
and
none
of
it
had
been
satisfied
by
my
love
affair
and
my
marriage
i
had
pursued
an
elusive
gleam
of
beauty
to
the
disregard
of
all
else
and
it
had
failed
me
it
had
faded
when
i
had
hoped
it
would
grow
brighter
i
despaired
of
life
and
was
embittered
and
things
happened
as
i
am
telling
i
don
t
draw
any
moral
at
all
in
the
matter
and
as
for
social
remedies
i
leave
them
to
the
social
reformer
i
ve
got
to
a
time
of
life
when
the
only
theories
that
interest
me
are
generalisations
about
realities
to
go
to
our
inner
office
in
raggett
street
i
had
to
walk
through
a
room
in
which
the
typists
worked
they
were
the
correspondence
typists
our
books
and
invoicing
had
long
since
overflowed
into
the
premises
we
had
had
the
luck
to
secure
on
either
side
of
us
i
was
i
must
confess
always
in
a
faintly
way
aware
of
that
collection
of
for
the
most
part
femininity
but
presently
one
of
the
girls
detached
herself
from
the
others
and
got
a
real
hold
upon
my
attention
i
appreciated
her
at
first
as
a
straight
little
back
a
neater
back
than
any
of
the
others
as
a
softly
rounded
neck
with
a
smiling
necklace
of
sham
pearls
as
chestnut
hair
very
neatly
done
and
as
a
glance
presently
as
a
quickly
turned
face
that
looked
for
me
my
eye
would
seek
her
as
i
went
through
on
business
things
i
dictated
some
letters
to
her
and
so
discovered
she
had
pretty
hands
with
pink
nails
once
or
twice
meeting
casually
we
looked
one
another
for
the
flash
of
a
second
in
the
eyes
that
was
all
but
it
was
enough
in
the
mysterious
of
sex
to
say
essential
things
we
had
a
secret
between
us
one
day
i
came
into
raggett
street
at
lunch
time
and
she
was
alone
sitting
at
her
desk
she
glanced
up
as
i
entered
and
then
became
very
still
with
a
downcast
face
and
her
hands
clenched
on
the
table
i
walked
right
by
her
to
the
door
of
the
inner
office
stopped
came
back
and
stood
over
her
we
neither
of
us
spoke
for
quite
a
perceptible
time
i
was
trembling
violently
is
that
one
of
the
new
typewriters
i
asked
at
last
for
the
sake
of
speaking
she
looked
up
at
me
without
a
word
with
her
face
flushed
and
her
eyes
alight
and
i
bent
down
and
kissed
her
lips
she
leant
back
to
put
an
arm
about
me
drew
my
face
to
her
and
kissed
me
again
and
again
i
lifted
her
and
held
her
in
my
arms
she
gave
a
little
smothered
cry
to
feel
herself
so
held
never
before
had
i
known
the
quality
of
passionate
kisses
somebody
became
audible
in
the
shop
outside
we
started
back
from
one
another
with
flushed
faces
and
bright
and
burning
eyes
we
can
t
talk
here
i
whispered
with
a
confident
intimacy
where
do
you
go
at
five
along
the
embankment
to
charing
cross
she
answered
as
intimately
none
of
the
others
go
that
way
about
five
yes
five
the
door
from
the
shop
opened
and
she
sat
down
very
quickly
i
m
glad
i
said
in
a
commonplace
voice
that
these
new
typewriters
are
all
i
went
into
the
inner
office
and
routed
out
the
paysheet
in
order
to
find
her
name
effie
rink
and
did
no
work
at
all
that
afternoon
i
fretted
about
that
dingy
little
den
like
a
beast
in
a
cage
when
presently
i
went
out
effie
was
working
with
an
extraordinary
appearance
of
calm
and
there
was
no
look
for
me
at
all
we
met
and
had
our
talk
that
evening
a
talk
in
whispers
when
there
was
none
to
overhear
we
came
to
an
understanding
it
was
strangely
unlike
any
dream
of
romance
i
had
ever
entertained
vii
i
came
back
after
a
week
s
absence
to
my
home
again
a
changed
man
i
had
lived
out
my
first
rush
of
passion
for
effie
had
come
to
a
contemplation
of
my
position
i
had
gauged
effie
s
place
in
the
scheme
of
things
and
parted
from
her
for
a
time
she
was
back
in
her
place
at
raggett
street
after
a
temporary
indisposition
i
did
not
feel
in
any
way
penitent
or
ashamed
i
know
as
i
opened
the
little
gate
that
kept
marion
s
front
grader
and
pampas
grass
from
the
wandering
dog
indeed
if
anything
i
felt
as
if
i
had
vindicated
some
right
that
had
been
in
question
i
came
back
to
marion
with
no
sense
of
at
all
with
indeed
a
new
friendliness
towards
her
i
don
t
know
how
it
may
be
proper
to
feel
on
such
occasions
that
is
how
i
felt
i
followed
her
in
our
standing
beside
the
tall
that
half
filled
the
bay
as
though
she
had
just
turned
from
watching
for
me
at
the
window
there
was
something
in
her
pale
face
that
arrested
me
she
looked
as
if
she
had
not
been
sleeping
she
did
not
come
forward
to
greet
me
you
ve
come
home
she
said
as
i
wrote
to
she
stood
very
still
a
dusky
figure
against
the
bright
window
where
have
you
been
she
asked
east
coast
i
said
easily
she
paused
for
a
moment
i
know
she
said
i
stared
at
her
it
was
the
most
amazing
moment
in
any
life
by
jove
i
said
at
last
i
believe
you
do
and
then
you
come
home
to
me
i
walked
to
the
hearthrug
and
stood
quite
still
there
regarding
this
new
situation
i
didn
t
dream
she
began
how
could
you
do
such
a
thing
it
seemed
a
long
interval
before
either
of
us
spoke
another
word
who
knows
about
it
i
asked
at
last
smithie
s
brother
they
were
at
confound
cromer
yes
how
could
you
bring
yourself
i
felt
a
spasm
of
petulant
annoyance
at
this
unexpected
catastrophe
i
should
like
to
wring
smithie
s
brother
s
neck
i
said
marion
spoke
in
dry
broken
fragments
of
sentences
you
i
d
always
thought
that
anyhow
you
couldn
t
deceive
me
i
suppose
all
men
are
horrid
about
it
doesn
t
strike
me
as
horrid
it
seems
to
me
the
most
necessary
consequence
and
natural
thing
in
the
i
became
aware
of
some
one
moving
about
in
the
passage
and
went
and
shut
the
door
of
the
room
then
i
walked
back
to
the
hearthrug
and
turned
it
s
rough
on
you
i
said
but
i
didn
t
mean
you
to
know
you
ve
never
cared
for
me
i
ve
had
the
devil
of
a
time
why
should
you
mind
she
sat
down
in
a
draped
armchair
i
have
cared
for
you
she
said
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
i
suppose
she
said
she
cares
for
you
i
had
no
answer
where
is
she
now
oh
does
it
matter
to
you
look
here
marion
this
this
i
didn
t
anticipate
i
didn
t
mean
this
thing
to
smash
down
on
you
like
this
but
you
know
something
had
to
happen
i
m
sorry
sorry
to
the
bottom
of
my
heart
that
things
have
come
to
this
between
us
but
indeed
i
m
taken
by
surprise
i
don
t
know
where
i
am
i
don
t
know
how
we
got
here
things
took
me
by
surprise
i
found
myself
alone
with
her
one
day
i
kissed
her
i
went
on
it
seemed
stupid
to
go
back
and
besides
why
should
i
have
gone
back
why
should
i
from
first
to
last
i
ve
hardly
thought
of
it
as
touching
you
damn
she
scrutinised
my
face
and
pulled
at
the
of
the
little
table
beside
her
to
think
of
it
she
said
i
don
t
believe
i
can
ever
touch
you
we
kept
a
long
silence
i
was
only
beginning
to
realise
in
the
most
superficial
way
the
immense
catastrophe
that
had
happened
between
us
enormous
issues
had
rushed
upon
us
i
felt
unprepared
and
altogether
inadequate
i
was
unreasonably
angry
there
came
a
rush
of
stupid
expressions
to
my
mind
that
my
rising
sense
of
the
supreme
importance
of
the
moment
saved
me
from
saying
the
gap
of
silence
widened
until
it
threatened
to
become
the
vast
memorable
margin
of
some
one
among
a
thousand
trivial
possibilities
of
speech
that
would
vex
our
relations
for
ever
our
little
general
servant
tapped
at
the
door
marion
always
liked
the
servant
to
tap
and
appeared
tea
m
m
she
said
and
vanished
leaving
the
door
open
i
will
go
upstairs
said
i
and
stopped
i
will
go
upstairs
i
repeated
and
put
my
bag
in
the
spare
we
remained
motionless
and
silent
for
a
few
seconds
mother
is
having
tea
with
us
marion
remarked
at
last
and
dropped
the
worried
end
of
and
stood
up
slowly
and
so
with
this
immense
discussion
of
our
changed
relations
hanging
over
us
we
presently
had
tea
with
the
unsuspecting
ramboat
and
the
spaniel
ramboat
was
too
well
trained
in
her
position
to
remark
upon
our
somber
preoccupation
she
kept
a
thin
trickle
of
talk
going
and
told
us
i
remember
that
ramboat
was
troubled
about
his
cannas
they
don
t
come
up
and
they
won
t
come
up
he
s
been
round
and
had
an
explanation
with
the
man
who
sold
him
the
bulbs
and
he
s
very
heated
and
the
spaniel
was
a
great
bore
begging
and
doing
small
tricks
first
at
one
and
then
at
the
other
of
us
neither
of
us
used
his
name
you
see
we
had
called
him
miggles
and
made
a
sort
of
trio
in
the
of
mutney
and
miggles
and
ming
viii
then
presently
we
resumed
our
monstrous
momentous
dialogue
i
can
t
now
make
out
how
long
that
dialogue
went
on
it
spread
itself
i
know
in
heavy
fragments
over
either
three
days
or
four
i
remember
myself
grouped
with
marion
talking
sitting
on
our
bed
in
her
room
talking
standing
in
our
saving
this
thing
or
that
twice
we
went
for
long
walks
and
we
had
a
long
evening
alone
together
with
jaded
nerves
and
hearts
that
fluctuated
between
a
hard
and
dreary
recognition
of
facts
and
on
my
part
at
least
a
strange
unwonted
tenderness
because
in
some
extraordinary
way
this
crisis
had
destroyed
our
mutual
apathy
and
made
us
feel
one
another
again
it
was
a
dialogue
that
had
discrepant
parts
that
fell
into
lumps
of
talk
that
failed
to
join
on
to
their
predecessors
that
began
again
at
a
different
level
higher
or
lower
that
assumed
new
aspects
in
the
intervals
and
assimilated
new
considerations
we
discussed
the
fact
that
we
two
were
no
longer
lovers
never
before
had
we
faced
that
it
seems
a
strange
thing
to
write
but
as
i
look
back
i
see
clearly
that
those
several
days
were
the
time
when
marion
and
i
were
closest
together
looked
for
the
first
and
last
time
faithfully
and
steadfastly
into
each
other
s
soul
for
those
days
only
there
were
no
pretences
i
made
no
concessions
to
her
nor
she
to
me
we
concealed
nothing
exaggerated
nothing
we
had
done
with
pretending
we
had
it
out
plainly
and
soberly
with
each
other
mood
followed
mood
and
got
its
stark
expression
of
course
there
was
quarreling
between
us
bitter
quarreling
and
we
said
things
to
one
another
long
things
that
bruised
and
crushed
and
cut
but
over
it
all
in
my
memory
now
is
an
effect
of
deliberate
confrontation
and
the
figure
of
marion
stands
up
pale
melancholy
injured
implacable
and
dignified
you
love
her
she
asked
once
and
jerked
that
doubt
into
my
mind
i
struggled
with
tangled
ideas
and
emotions
i
don
t
know
what
love
is
it
s
all
sorts
of
things
it
s
made
of
a
dozen
strands
twisted
in
a
thousand
but
you
want
her
you
want
her
now
when
you
think
of
her
yes
i
reflected
i
want
her
right
and
me
where
do
i
come
in
i
suppose
you
come
in
well
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
do
i
said
with
the
exasperation
of
the
situation
growing
upon
me
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
as
i
look
back
upon
all
that
time
across
a
gulf
of
fifteen
active
years
i
find
i
see
it
with
an
understanding
judgment
i
see
it
as
if
it
were
the
business
of
some
one
else
indeed
of
two
other
people
intimately
known
yet
judged
without
passion
i
see
now
that
this
shock
this
sudden
immense
disillusionment
did
in
real
fact
bring
out
a
mind
and
soul
in
marion
that
for
the
first
time
she
emerged
from
habits
timidities
imitations
phrases
and
a
certain
narrow
and
became
a
personality
her
ruling
motive
at
first
was
i
think
an
indignant
and
outraged
pride
this
situation
must
end
she
asked
me
categorically
to
give
up
effie
and
i
full
of
fresh
and
glowing
memories
absolutely
refused
it
s
too
late
marion
i
said
it
can
t
be
done
like
then
we
can
t
very
well
go
on
living
together
she
said
can
we
very
well
i
deliberated
if
you
must
have
it
well
can
we
can
you
stay
in
this
house
i
mean
if
i
go
away
i
don
t
know
i
don
t
think
i
then
what
do
you
want
slowly
we
worked
our
way
from
point
to
point
until
at
last
the
word
divorce
was
before
us
if
we
can
t
live
together
we
ought
to
be
free
said
marion
i
don
t
know
anything
of
divorce
i
said
if
you
mean
that
i
don
t
know
how
it
is
done
i
shall
have
to
ask
somebody
or
look
it
up
perhaps
after
all
it
is
the
thing
to
do
we
may
as
well
face
we
began
to
talk
ourselves
into
a
realisation
of
what
our
divergent
futures
might
be
i
came
back
on
the
evening
of
that
day
with
my
questions
answered
by
a
solicitor
we
can
t
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
said
get
divorced
as
things
are
apparently
so
far
as
the
law
goes
you
ve
got
to
stand
this
sort
of
thing
it
s
silly
but
that
is
the
law
however
it
s
easy
to
arrange
a
divorce
in
addition
to
adultery
there
must
be
desertion
or
cruelty
to
establish
cruelty
i
should
have
to
strike
you
or
something
of
that
sort
before
witnesses
that
s
impossible
but
it
s
simple
to
desert
you
legally
i
have
to
go
away
from
you
that
s
all
i
can
go
on
sending
you
money
and
you
bring
a
suit
what
is
it
for
restitution
of
conjugal
rights
the
court
orders
me
to
return
i
disobey
then
you
can
go
on
to
divorce
me
you
get
a
decree
nisi
and
once
more
the
court
tries
to
make
me
come
back
if
we
don
t
make
it
up
within
six
months
and
if
you
don
t
behave
scandalously
the
decree
is
made
absolute
that
s
the
end
of
the
fuss
that
s
how
one
gets
unmarried
it
s
easier
you
see
to
marry
than
and
then
how
do
i
live
what
becomes
of
me
you
ll
have
an
income
they
call
it
alimony
from
a
third
to
a
half
of
my
present
income
more
if
you
like
i
don
t
mind
three
hundred
a
year
say
you
ve
got
your
old
people
to
keep
and
you
ll
need
all
and
then
then
you
ll
be
free
both
of
and
all
this
life
you
ve
hated
i
looked
up
at
her
wrung
and
bitter
face
i
haven
t
hated
it
i
lied
my
voice
near
breaking
with
the
pain
of
it
all
have
you
ix
the
perplexing
thing
about
life
is
the
irresolvable
complexity
of
reality
of
things
and
relations
alike
nothing
is
simple
every
wrong
done
has
a
certain
justice
in
it
and
every
good
deed
has
dregs
of
evil
as
for
us
young
still
and
still
without
resounded
a
hundred
discordant
notes
in
the
harsh
angle
of
that
shock
we
were
furiously
angry
with
each
other
tender
with
each
other
callously
selfish
generously
i
remember
marion
saying
innumerable
detached
things
that
didn
t
hang
together
one
with
another
that
contradicted
one
another
that
were
nevertheless
all
in
their
places
profoundly
true
and
sincere
i
see
them
now
as
so
many
vain
experiments
in
her
effort
to
apprehend
the
crumpled
confusions
of
our
complex
moral
landslide
some
i
found
irritating
beyond
measure
i
answered
her
sometimes
quite
abominably
of
course
she
would
say
again
and
again
my
life
has
been
a
i
ve
besieged
you
for
three
years
i
would
retort
asking
it
not
to
be
you
ve
done
as
you
pleased
if
i
ve
turned
away
at
last
or
again
she
would
revive
all
the
stresses
before
our
marriage
how
you
must
hate
me
i
made
you
wait
well
now
i
suppose
you
have
your
revenge
i
echoed
then
she
would
try
over
the
aspects
of
our
new
separated
lives
i
ought
to
earn
my
own
living
she
would
insist
i
want
to
be
quite
independent
i
ve
always
hated
london
perhaps
i
shall
try
a
poultry
farm
and
bees
you
won
t
mind
at
first
my
being
a
burden
afterwards
we
ve
settled
all
that
i
said
i
suppose
you
will
hate
me
anyhow
there
were
times
when
she
seemed
to
regard
our
separation
with
absolute
complacency
when
she
would
plan
all
sorts
of
freedoms
and
characteristic
interests
i
shall
go
out
a
lot
with
smithie
she
said
and
once
she
said
an
ugly
thing
that
i
did
indeed
hate
her
for
that
i
can
not
even
now
quite
forgive
her
your
aunt
will
rejoice
at
all
this
she
never
cared
for
me
into
my
memory
of
these
pains
and
stresses
comes
the
figure
of
smithie
with
emotion
so
breathless
in
the
presence
of
the
horrid
villain
of
the
piece
that
she
could
make
no
articulate
sounds
she
had
long
tearful
confidences
with
marion
i
know
sympathetic
close
clingings
there
were
moments
when
only
absolute
speechlessness
prevented
her
giving
me
a
stupendous
i
could
see
it
in
her
eye
the
wrong
things
she
would
have
said
and
i
recall
too
ramboat
s
slow
awakening
to
something
in
the
air
the
growing
expression
of
solicitude
in
her
eye
only
her
fear
of
marion
keeping
her
from
speech
and
at
last
through
all
this
welter
like
a
thing
fated
and
altogether
beyond
our
control
parting
came
to
marion
and
me
i
hardened
my
heart
or
i
could
not
have
gone
for
at
the
last
it
came
to
marion
that
she
was
parting
from
me
for
ever
that
overbore
all
other
things
had
turned
our
last
hour
to
anguish
she
forgot
for
a
time
the
prospect
of
moving
into
a
new
house
she
forgot
the
outrage
on
her
proprietorship
and
pride
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
really
showed
strong
emotions
in
regard
to
me
for
the
first
time
perhaps
they
really
came
to
her
she
began
to
weep
slow
reluctant
tears
i
came
into
her
room
and
found
her
asprawl
on
the
bed
weeping
i
didn
t
know
she
cried
oh
i
didn
t
understand
i
ve
been
a
fool
all
my
life
is
a
wreck
i
shall
be
alone
mutney
mutney
don
t
leave
me
oh
mutney
i
didn
t
i
had
to
harden
my
heart
indeed
for
it
seemed
to
me
at
moments
in
those
last
hours
together
that
at
last
too
late
the
thing
had
happened
and
marion
had
come
alive
a
hunger
for
me
lit
her
eyes
don
t
leave
me
she
said
don
t
leave
me
she
clung
to
me
she
kissed
me
with
lips
i
was
promised
now
and
pledged
and
i
hardened
my
heart
against
this
impossible
dawn
yet
it
seems
to
me
that
there
were
moments
when
it
needed
but
a
cry
but
one
word
to
have
united
us
again
for
all
our
lives
could
we
have
united
again
would
that
passage
have
enlightened
us
for
ever
or
should
we
have
fallen
back
in
a
week
or
so
into
the
old
estrangement
the
old
temperamental
opposition
of
that
there
is
now
no
telling
our
own
resolve
carried
us
on
our
predestined
way
we
behaved
more
and
more
like
separating
lovers
parting
inexorably
but
all
the
preparations
we
had
set
going
worked
on
like
a
machine
and
we
made
no
attempt
to
stop
them
my
trunks
and
boxes
went
to
the
station
i
packed
my
bag
with
marion
standing
before
me
we
were
like
children
who
had
hurt
each
other
horribly
in
sheer
stupidity
who
didn
t
know
now
how
to
remedy
it
we
belonged
to
each
other
immensely
immensely
the
cab
came
to
the
little
iron
gate
i
said
for
a
moment
we
held
one
another
in
each
other
s
arms
and
kissed
incredibly
without
malice
we
heard
our
little
servant
in
the
passage
going
to
open
the
door
for
the
last
time
we
pressed
ourselves
to
one
another
we
were
not
lovers
nor
enemies
but
two
human
souls
in
a
frank
community
of
pain
i
tore
myself
from
her
go
away
i
said
to
the
servant
seeing
that
marion
had
followed
me
down
i
felt
her
standing
behind
me
as
i
spoke
to
the
cab
man
i
got
into
the
cab
resolutely
not
looking
back
and
then
as
it
started
jumped
up
craned
out
and
looked
at
the
door
it
was
wide
open
but
she
had
disappeared
i
wonder
i
suppose
she
ran
upstairs
x
so
i
parted
from
marion
at
an
extremity
of
perturbation
and
regret
and
went
as
i
had
promised
and
arranged
to
effie
who
was
waiting
for
me
in
apartments
near
orpington
i
remember
her
upon
the
station
platform
a
bright
flitting
figure
looking
along
the
train
for
me
and
our
walk
over
the
fields
in
the
twilight
i
had
expected
an
immense
sense
of
relief
where
at
last
the
stresses
of
separation
were
over
but
now
i
found
i
was
beyond
measure
wretched
and
perplexed
full
of
the
profoundest
persuasion
of
irreparable
error
the
dusk
and
somber
marion
were
so
alike
her
sorrow
seemed
to
be
all
about
me
i
had
to
hold
myself
to
my
own
plans
to
remember
that
i
must
keep
faith
with
effie
with
effie
who
had
made
no
terms
exacted
no
guarantees
but
flung
herself
into
my
hands
we
went
across
the
evening
fields
in
silence
towards
a
sky
of
deepening
gold
and
purple
and
effie
was
close
beside
me
always
very
close
glancing
up
ever
and
again
at
my
face
certainly
she
knew
i
grieved
for
marion
that
ours
was
now
no
joyful
reunion
but
she
showed
no
resentment
and
no
jealousy
extraordinarily
she
did
not
compete
against
marion
never
once
in
all
our
time
together
did
she
say
an
adverse
word
of
marion
she
set
herself
presently
to
dispel
the
shadow
that
brooded
over
me
with
the
same
instinctive
skill
that
some
women
will
show
with
the
trouble
of
a
child
she
made
herself
my
glad
and
pretty
slave
and
handmaid
she
forced
me
at
last
to
rejoice
in
her
yet
at
the
back
of
it
all
marion
remained
stupid
and
tearful
and
infinitely
distressful
so
that
i
was
almost
intolerably
unhappy
for
her
for
her
and
the
dead
body
of
my
married
love
it
is
all
as
i
tell
it
now
unaccountable
to
me
i
go
back
into
these
remote
parts
these
rarely
visited
uplands
and
lonely
tares
of
memory
and
it
seems
to
me
still
a
strange
country
i
had
thought
i
might
be
going
to
some
sensuous
paradise
with
effie
but
desire
which
fills
the
universe
before
its
satisfaction
vanishes
utterly
like
the
going
of
daylight
with
achievement
all
the
facts
and
forms
of
life
remain
darkling
and
cold
it
was
an
upland
of
melancholy
questionings
a
region
from
which
i
saw
all
the
world
at
new
angles
and
in
new
aspects
i
had
outflanked
passion
and
romance
i
had
come
into
a
condition
of
vast
perplexities
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
at
least
so
it
seems
to
me
now
in
this
retrospect
i
looked
at
my
existence
as
a
whole
since
this
was
nothing
what
was
i
doing
what
was
i
for
i
was
going
to
and
fro
about
the
business
i
had
taken
up
to
secure
marion
and
which
held
me
now
in
spite
of
our
intimate
separation
and
snatching
odd
and
nights
for
orpington
and
all
the
while
i
struggled
with
these
obstinate
interrogations
i
used
to
fall
into
musing
in
the
trains
i
became
even
a
little
inaccurate
and
forgetful
about
business
things
i
have
the
clearest
memory
of
myself
sitting
thoughtful
in
the
evening
sunlight
on
a
grassy
hillside
that
looked
toward
seven
oaks
and
commanded
a
wide
sweep
of
country
and
that
i
was
thinking
out
my
destiny
i
could
almost
write
my
thought
down
now
i
believe
as
they
came
to
me
that
afternoon
effie
restless
little
cockney
that
she
was
rustled
and
struggled
in
a
hedgerow
below
gathering
flowers
discovering
flowers
she
had
never
seen
before
i
had
i
remember
a
letter
from
marion
in
my
pocket
i
had
even
made
some
tentatives
for
return
for
a
reconciliation
heaven
knows
now
how
i
had
put
it
but
her
cold
letter
repelled
me
i
perceived
i
could
never
face
that
old
inconclusive
dullness
of
life
again
that
stagnant
disappointment
that
anyhow
wasn
t
possible
but
what
was
possible
i
could
see
no
way
of
honour
or
fine
living
before
me
at
all
what
am
i
to
do
with
life
that
was
the
question
that
besieged
me
i
wondered
if
all
the
world
was
even
as
i
urged
to
this
by
one
motive
and
to
that
by
another
creatures
of
chance
and
impulse
and
unmeaning
traditions
had
i
indeed
to
abide
by
what
i
had
said
and
done
and
chosen
was
there
nothing
for
me
in
honour
but
to
provide
for
effie
go
back
penitent
to
marion
and
keep
to
my
trade
in
rubbish
or
find
some
fresh
one
and
so
work
out
the
residue
of
my
days
i
didn
t
accept
that
for
a
moment
but
what
else
was
i
to
do
i
wondered
if
my
case
was
the
case
of
many
men
whether
in
former
ages
too
men
had
been
so
guideless
so
uncharted
so
haphazard
in
their
journey
into
life
in
the
middle
ages
in
the
old
catholic
days
one
went
to
a
priest
and
he
said
with
all
the
finality
of
natural
law
this
you
are
and
this
you
must
do
i
wondered
whether
even
in
the
middle
ages
i
should
have
accepted
that
ruling
without
question
i
remember
too
very
distinctly
how
effie
came
and
sat
beside
me
on
a
little
box
that
was
before
the
casement
window
of
our
room
gloomkins
said
she
i
smiled
and
remained
head
on
hand
looking
out
of
the
window
forgetful
of
her
did
you
love
your
wife
so
well
she
whispered
softly
oh
i
cried
recalled
again
i
don
t
know
i
don
t
understand
these
things
life
is
a
thing
that
hurts
my
dear
it
hurts
without
logic
or
reason
i
ve
blundered
i
didn
t
understand
anyhow
there
is
no
need
to
go
hurting
you
is
there
and
i
turned
about
and
drew
her
to
me
and
kissed
her
ear
yes
i
had
a
very
bad
time
i
still
recall
i
suffered
i
suppose
from
a
sort
of
ennui
of
the
imagination
i
found
myself
without
an
object
to
hold
my
will
together
i
sought
i
read
restlessly
and
discursively
i
tried
ewart
and
got
no
help
from
him
as
i
regard
it
all
now
in
this
retrospect
it
seems
to
me
as
if
in
those
days
of
disgust
and
abandoned
aims
i
discovered
myself
for
the
first
time
before
that
i
had
seen
only
the
world
and
things
in
it
had
sought
them
of
all
but
my
impulse
now
i
found
myself
grouped
with
a
system
of
appetites
and
satisfactions
with
much
work
to
do
and
no
desire
it
seemed
left
in
me
there
were
moments
when
i
thought
of
suicide
at
times
my
life
appeared
before
me
in
bleak
relentless
light
a
series
of
ignorances
crude
blunderings
degradation
and
cruelty
i
had
what
the
old
theologians
call
a
conviction
of
i
sought
salvation
not
perhaps
in
the
formula
a
methodist
preacher
would
recognise
but
salvation
nevertheless
men
find
their
salvation
nowadays
in
many
ways
names
and
forms
don
t
i
think
matter
very
much
the
real
need
is
something
that
we
can
hold
and
that
holds
one
i
have
known
a
man
find
that
determining
factor
in
a
factory
and
another
in
writing
a
history
of
the
manor
so
long
as
it
holds
one
it
does
not
matter
many
men
and
women
nowadays
take
up
some
concrete
aspect
of
socialism
or
social
reform
but
socialism
for
me
has
always
been
a
little
bit
too
human
too
set
about
with
personalities
and
foolishness
it
isn
t
my
line
i
don
t
like
things
so
human
i
don
t
think
i
m
blind
to
the
fun
the
surprises
the
jolly
little
coarsenesses
and
insufficiency
of
life
to
the
humour
of
it
as
people
say
and
to
adventure
but
that
isn
t
the
root
of
the
matter
with
me
there
s
no
humour
in
my
blood
i
m
in
earnest
in
warp
and
woof
i
stumble
and
flounder
but
i
know
that
over
all
these
merry
immediate
things
there
are
other
things
that
are
great
and
serene
very
high
beautiful
things
the
reality
i
haven
t
got
it
but
it
s
there
nevertheless
i
m
a
spiritual
guttersnipe
in
love
with
unimaginable
goddesses
i
ve
never
seen
the
goddesses
nor
ever
shall
but
it
takes
all
the
fun
out
of
the
mud
and
at
times
i
fear
it
takes
all
the
kindliness
too
but
i
m
talking
of
things
i
can
t
expect
the
reader
to
understand
because
i
don
t
half
understand
them
myself
there
is
something
links
things
for
me
a
sunset
or
so
a
mood
or
so
the
high
air
something
there
was
in
marion
s
form
and
colour
something
i
find
and
lose
in
mantegna
s
pictures
something
in
the
lines
of
these
boats
i
make
you
should
see
my
last
and
best
i
can
t
explain
myself
i
perceive
perhaps
it
all
comes
to
this
that
i
am
a
hard
and
morally
limited
cad
with
a
mind
beyond
my
merits
naturally
i
resist
that
as
a
complete
solution
anyhow
i
had
a
sense
of
inexorable
need
of
distress
and
insufficiency
that
was
unendurable
and
for
a
time
this
aeronautical
engineering
allayed
it
in
the
end
of
this
particular
crisis
of
which
i
tell
so
badly
i
idealised
science
i
decided
that
in
power
and
knowledge
lay
the
salvation
of
my
life
the
secret
that
would
fill
my
need
that
to
these
things
i
would
give
myself
i
emerged
at
last
like
a
man
who
has
been
diving
in
darkness
clutching
at
a
new
resolve
for
which
he
had
groped
desperately
and
long
i
came
into
the
inner
office
suddenly
one
day
it
must
have
been
just
before
the
time
of
marion
s
suit
for
restitution
and
sat
down
before
my
uncle
look
here
i
said
i
m
sick
of
hullo
he
answered
and
put
some
papers
aside
what
s
up
george
things
are
as
how
my
life
i
said
it
s
a
mess
an
infinite
she
s
been
a
stupid
girl
george
he
said
i
partly
understand
but
you
re
quit
of
her
now
practically
and
there
s
just
as
good
fish
in
the
sea
oh
it
s
not
that
i
cried
that
s
only
the
part
that
shows
i
m
sick
i
m
sick
of
all
this
damned
eh
eh
said
my
uncle
what
rascality
oh
you
know
i
want
some
stuff
man
i
want
something
to
hold
on
to
i
shall
go
amok
if
i
don
t
get
it
i
m
a
different
sort
of
beast
from
you
you
float
in
all
this
bunkum
feel
like
a
man
floundering
in
a
universe
of
soapsuds
up
and
downs
east
and
west
i
can
t
stand
it
i
must
get
my
foot
on
something
solid
or
i
don
t
know
i
laughed
at
the
consternation
in
his
face
i
mean
it
i
said
i
ve
been
thinking
it
over
i
ve
made
up
my
mind
it
s
no
good
arguing
i
shall
go
in
for
work
real
work
no
this
isn
t
work
it
s
only
laborious
cheating
but
i
ve
got
an
idea
it
s
an
old
idea
i
thought
of
years
ago
but
it
came
back
to
me
look
here
why
should
i
fence
about
with
you
i
believe
the
time
has
come
for
flying
to
be
possible
real
flying
flying
i
stuck
to
that
and
it
helped
me
through
the
worst
time
in
my
life
my
uncle
after
some
resistance
and
a
talk
with
my
aunt
behaved
like
the
father
of
a
spoilt
son
he
fixed
up
an
arrangement
that
gave
me
capital
to
play
with
released
me
from
too
constant
a
solicitude
for
the
newer
business
developments
this
was
in
what
i
may
call
the
later
moggs
period
of
our
enterprises
and
i
went
to
work
at
once
with
grim
intensity
but
i
will
tell
of
my
soaring
and
flying
machines
in
the
proper
place
i
ve
been
leaving
the
story
of
my
uncle
altogether
too
long
i
wanted
merely
to
tell
how
it
was
i
took
to
this
work
i
took
to
these
experiments
after
i
had
sought
something
that
marion
in
some
indefinable
way
had
seemed
to
promise
i
toiled
and
forgot
myself
for
a
time
and
did
many
things
science
too
has
been
something
of
an
irresponsive
mistress
since
though
i
ve
served
her
better
than
i
served
marion
but
at
the
time
science
with
her
order
her
inhuman
distance
yet
steely
certainties
saved
me
from
despair
well
i
have
still
to
fly
but
incidentally
i
have
invented
the
lightest
engines
in
the
world
i
am
trying
to
tell
of
all
the
things
that
happened
to
me
it
s
hard
enough
simply
to
get
it
put
down
in
the
remotest
degree
right
but
this
is
a
novel
not
a
treatise
don
t
imagine
that
i
am
coming
presently
to
any
sort
of
solution
of
my
difficulties
here
among
my
drawings
and
hammerings
now
i
still
question
unanswering
problems
all
my
life
has
been
at
bottom
seeking
disbelieving
always
dissatisfied
always
with
the
thing
seen
and
the
thing
believed
seeking
something
in
toil
in
force
in
danger
something
whose
name
and
nature
i
do
not
clearly
understand
something
beautiful
worshipful
enduring
mine
profoundly
and
fundamentally
and
the
utter
redemption
of
myself
i
don
t
know
all
i
can
tell
is
that
it
is
something
i
have
ever
failed
to
find
xi
but
before
i
finish
this
chapter
and
book
altogether
and
go
on
with
the
great
adventure
of
my
uncle
s
career
i
may
perhaps
tell
what
else
remains
to
tell
of
marion
and
effie
and
then
for
a
time
set
my
private
life
behind
me
for
a
time
marion
and
i
corresponded
with
some
regularity
writing
friendly
but
rather
uninforming
letters
about
small
business
things
the
clumsy
process
of
divorce
completed
itself
she
left
the
house
at
ealing
and
went
into
the
country
with
her
aunt
and
parents
taking
a
small
farm
near
lewes
in
sussex
she
put
up
glass
she
put
in
heat
for
her
father
happy
man
and
spoke
of
figs
and
peaches
the
thing
seemed
to
promise
well
throughout
a
spring
and
summer
but
the
sussex
winter
after
london
was
too
much
for
the
ramboats
they
got
very
muddy
and
dull
ramboat
killed
a
cow
by
improper
feeding
and
that
disheartened
them
all
a
twelvemonth
saw
the
enterprise
in
difficulties
i
had
to
help
her
out
of
this
and
then
they
returned
to
london
and
she
went
into
partnership
with
smithie
at
streatham
and
ran
a
business
that
was
intimated
on
the
firm
s
stationery
as
the
parents
and
aunt
were
stowed
away
in
a
cottage
somewhere
after
that
the
letters
became
infrequent
but
in
one
i
remember
a
postscript
that
had
a
little
stab
of
our
old
intimacy
poor
old
miggles
is
nearly
eight
years
slipped
by
i
grew
up
i
grew
in
experience
in
capacity
until
i
was
fully
a
man
but
with
many
new
interests
living
on
a
larger
scale
in
a
wider
world
than
i
could
have
dreamt
of
in
my
marion
days
her
letters
become
rare
and
insignificant
at
last
came
a
gap
of
silence
that
made
me
curious
for
eighteen
months
or
more
i
had
nothing
from
marion
save
her
quarterly
receipts
through
the
bank
then
i
damned
at
smithie
and
wrote
a
card
to
marion
dear
marion
i
said
how
goes
it
she
astonished
me
tremendously
by
telling
me
she
had
married
again
a
wachorn
a
leading
agent
in
the
but
she
still
wrote
on
the
ponderevo
and
smith
robes
notepaper
from
the
ponderevo
and
smith
address
and
that
except
for
a
little
difference
of
opinion
about
the
continuance
of
alimony
which
gave
me
some
passages
of
anger
and
the
use
of
my
name
by
the
firm
which
also
annoyed
me
is
the
end
of
marion
s
history
for
me
and
she
vanishes
out
of
this
story
i
do
not
know
where
she
is
or
what
she
is
doing
i
do
not
know
whether
she
is
alive
or
dead
it
seems
to
me
utterly
grotesque
that
two
people
who
have
stood
so
close
to
one
another
as
she
and
i
should
be
so
separated
but
so
it
is
between
us
effie
too
i
have
parted
from
though
i
still
see
her
at
times
between
us
there
was
never
any
intention
of
marriage
nor
intimacy
of
soul
she
had
a
sudden
fierce
passion
for
me
and
i
for
her
but
i
was
not
her
first
lover
nor
her
last
she
was
in
another
world
from
marion
she
had
a
queer
delightful
nature
i
ve
no
memory
of
ever
seeing
her
sullen
or
malicious
she
was
indeed
she
was
magnificently
eupeptic
that
i
think
was
the
central
secret
of
her
agreeableness
and
moreover
that
she
was
infinitely
i
helped
her
at
last
into
an
opening
she
coveted
and
she
amazed
me
by
a
sudden
display
of
business
capacity
she
has
now
a
typewriting
bureau
in
riffle
s
inn
and
she
runs
it
with
a
brisk
vigour
and
considerable
success
albeit
a
certain
plumpness
has
overtaken
her
and
she
still
loves
her
kind
she
married
a
year
or
so
ago
a
boy
half
her
age
a
wretch
of
a
poet
a
wretched
poet
and
given
to
drugs
a
thing
with
lank
fair
hair
always
getting
into
his
blue
eyes
and
limp
legs
she
did
it
she
said
because
he
needed
nursing
but
enough
of
this
disaster
of
my
marriage
and
of
my
early
love
affairs
i
have
told
all
that
is
needed
for
my
picture
to
explain
how
i
came
to
take
up
aeroplane
experiments
and
engineering
science
let
me
get
back
to
my
essential
story
to
and
my
uncle
s
promotions
and
to
the
vision
of
the
world
these
things
have
given
me
book
the
third
the
great
days
of
chapter
the
first
the
hardingham
hotel
and
how
we
became
big
people
i
but
now
that
i
resume
the
main
line
of
my
story
it
may
be
well
to
describe
the
personal
appearance
of
my
uncle
as
i
remember
him
during
those
magnificent
years
that
followed
his
passage
from
trade
to
finance
the
little
man
plumped
up
very
considerably
during
the
creation
of
the
property
but
with
the
increasing
excitements
that
followed
that
first
flotation
came
dyspepsia
and
a
certain
flabbiness
and
falling
away
his
abdomen
if
the
reader
will
pardon
my
taking
his
features
in
the
order
of
their
value
had
at
first
a
nice
full
roundness
but
afterwards
it
lost
tone
without
however
losing
size
he
always
went
as
though
he
was
proud
of
it
and
would
make
as
much
of
it
as
possible
to
the
last
his
movements
remained
quick
and
sudden
his
short
firm
legs
as
he
walked
seemed
to
twinkle
rather
than
display
the
of
common
humanity
and
he
never
seemed
to
have
knees
but
instead
a
dispersed
flexibility
of
limb
there
was
i
seem
to
remember
a
secular
intensification
of
his
features
his
nose
developed
character
became
aggressive
stuck
out
at
the
world
more
and
more
the
obliquity
of
his
mouth
i
think
increased
from
the
face
that
returns
to
my
memory
projects
a
long
cigar
that
is
sometimes
cocked
jauntily
up
from
the
higher
corner
that
sometimes
droops
from
the
lower
it
was
as
eloquent
as
a
dog
s
tail
and
he
removed
it
only
for
the
more
emphatic
modes
of
speech
he
assumed
a
broad
black
ribbon
for
his
glasses
and
wore
them
more
and
more
askew
as
time
went
on
his
hair
seemed
to
stiffen
with
success
but
towards
the
climax
it
thinned
greatly
over
the
crown
and
he
brushed
it
hard
back
over
his
ears
where
however
it
stuck
out
fiercely
it
always
stuck
out
fiercely
over
his
forehead
up
and
forward
he
adopted
an
urban
style
of
dressing
with
the
onset
of
and
rarely
abandoned
it
he
preferred
silk
hats
with
ample
rich
brims
often
a
trifle
large
for
him
by
modern
ideas
and
he
wore
them
at
various
angles
to
his
axis
his
taste
in
trouserings
was
towards
fairly
emphatic
stripes
and
his
trouser
cut
was
neat
he
liked
his
long
and
full
although
that
seemed
to
shorten
him
he
displayed
a
number
of
valuable
rings
and
i
remember
one
upon
his
left
little
finger
with
a
large
red
stone
bearing
gnostic
symbols
clever
chaps
those
gnostics
george
he
told
me
means
a
lot
lucky
he
never
had
any
but
a
black
mohair
in
the
country
he
affected
grey
and
a
large
grey
cloth
except
when
motoring
then
he
would
have
a
brown
cap
and
a
fur
suit
of
esquimaux
cut
with
a
sort
of
to
the
trousers
of
an
evening
he
would
wear
white
waistcoats
and
plain
gold
studs
he
hated
diamonds
flashy
he
said
they
were
might
as
well
wear
an
income
all
very
well
for
park
lane
unsold
stock
not
my
style
sober
financier
so
much
for
his
visible
presence
for
a
time
it
was
very
familiar
to
the
world
for
at
the
crest
of
the
boom
he
allowed
quite
a
number
of
photographs
and
at
least
one
pencil
sketch
to
be
published
in
the
sixpenny
papers
his
voice
declined
during
those
years
from
his
early
tenor
to
a
flat
rich
quality
of
sound
that
my
knowledge
of
music
is
inadequate
to
describe
his
inrush
of
air
became
less
frequent
as
he
ripened
but
returned
in
moments
of
excitement
throughout
his
career
in
spite
of
his
increasing
and
at
last
astounding
opulence
his
more
intimate
habits
remained
as
simple
as
they
had
been
at
wimblehurst
he
would
never
avail
himself
of
the
services
of
a
valet
at
the
very
climax
of
his
greatness
his
trousers
were
folded
by
a
housemaid
and
his
shoulders
brushed
as
he
left
his
house
or
hotel
he
became
wary
about
breakfast
as
life
advanced
and
at
one
time
talked
much
of
haig
and
uric
acid
but
for
other
meals
he
remained
reasonably
omnivorous
he
was
something
of
a
gastronome
and
would
eat
anything
he
particularly
liked
in
an
audible
manner
and
perspire
upon
his
forehead
he
was
a
studiously
moderate
drinker
except
when
the
spirit
of
some
public
banquet
or
some
great
occasion
caught
him
and
bore
him
beyond
his
wariness
there
he
would
as
it
were
drink
inadvertently
and
become
flushed
and
talkative
about
everything
but
his
business
projects
to
make
the
portrait
complete
one
wants
to
convey
an
effect
of
sudden
quick
bursts
of
movement
like
the
jumps
of
a
to
indicate
that
his
pose
whatever
it
is
has
been
preceded
and
will
be
followed
by
a
rush
if
i
were
painting
him
i
should
certainly
give
him
for
a
background
that
distressed
uneasy
sky
that
was
popular
in
the
eighteenth
century
and
at
a
convenient
distance
a
throbbing
very
big
and
contemporary
a
secretary
hurrying
with
papers
and
an
alert
chauffeur
such
was
the
figure
that
created
and
directed
the
great
property
of
and
from
the
successful
reconstruction
of
that
company
passed
on
to
a
slow
crescendo
of
magnificent
creations
and
promotions
until
the
whole
world
of
investors
marveled
i
have
already
i
think
mentioned
how
long
before
we
offered
tono
bungay
to
the
public
we
took
over
the
english
agency
of
certain
american
specialties
to
this
was
presently
added
our
exploitation
of
moggs
domestic
soap
and
so
he
took
up
the
domestic
convenience
campaign
that
coupled
with
his
equatorial
rotundity
and
a
certain
resolute
convexity
in
his
bearings
won
my
uncle
his
napoleonic
title
ii
it
illustrates
the
romantic
element
in
modern
commerce
that
my
uncle
met
young
moggs
at
a
city
dinner
i
think
it
was
the
company
when
both
were
some
way
advanced
beyond
the
initial
sobriety
of
the
occasion
this
was
the
grandson
of
the
original
moggs
and
a
very
typical
instance
of
an
educated
cultivated
degenerate
plutocrat
his
people
had
taken
him
about
in
his
youth
as
the
ruskins
took
their
john
and
fostered
a
passion
for
history
in
him
and
the
actual
management
of
the
moggs
industry
had
devolved
upon
a
cousin
and
a
junior
partner
moggs
being
of
a
studious
and
refined
disposition
had
just
decided
after
a
careful
search
for
a
congenial
subject
in
which
he
would
not
be
constantly
reminded
of
soap
to
devote
himself
to
the
history
of
the
thebaid
when
this
cousin
died
suddenly
and
precipitated
responsibilities
upon
him
in
the
frankness
of
conviviality
moggs
bewailed
the
uncongenial
task
thus
thrust
into
his
hands
and
my
uncle
offered
to
lighten
his
burden
by
a
partnership
then
and
there
they
even
got
to
terms
extremely
muzzy
terms
but
terms
nevertheless
each
gentleman
wrote
the
name
and
address
of
the
other
on
his
cuff
and
they
separated
in
a
mood
of
brotherly
carelessness
and
next
morning
neither
seems
to
have
thought
to
rescue
his
shirt
from
the
wash
until
it
was
too
late
my
uncle
made
a
painful
struggle
it
was
one
of
my
business
mornings
to
recall
name
and
particulars
he
was
an
long
blond
sort
of
chap
george
with
glasses
and
a
genteel
accent
he
said
i
was
puzzled
you
know
how
they
look
at
you
his
stuff
was
soap
i
m
pretty
nearly
certain
and
he
had
a
name
and
the
thing
was
the
straightest
you
ever
i
was
clear
enough
to
spot
that
we
went
out
at
last
with
knitted
brows
and
wandered
up
into
finsbury
seeking
a
good
looking
grocer
we
called
first
on
a
chemist
for
a
for
my
uncle
and
then
we
found
the
shop
we
needed
i
want
said
my
uncle
half
a
pound
of
every
sort
of
soap
you
got
yes
i
want
to
take
them
now
wait
a
moment
george
now
what
sort
of
soap
d
you
call
that
at
the
third
repetition
of
that
question
the
young
man
said
moggs
right
said
my
uncle
you
needn
t
guess
again
come
along
george
let
s
go
to
a
telephone
and
get
on
to
moggs
oh
the
order
certainly
i
confirm
it
send
it
all
send
it
all
to
the
bishop
of
london
he
ll
have
some
good
use
for
it
man
george
he
is
charities
and
all
that
and
put
it
down
to
me
here
s
a
card
ponderevo
then
we
went
on
to
moggs
and
found
him
in
a
in
a
luxurious
bed
drinking
china
tea
and
got
the
shape
of
everything
but
the
figures
fixed
by
lunch
time
young
moggs
enlarged
my
mind
considerably
he
was
a
sort
of
thing
i
hadn
t
met
before
he
seemed
quite
clean
and
and
he
assured
me
to
never
read
newspapers
nor
used
soap
in
any
form
at
all
delicate
skin
he
said
no
objection
to
our
advertising
you
wide
and
free
said
my
uncle
i
draw
the
line
at
railway
stations
said
moggs
cliffs
theatre
programmes
books
by
me
and
poetry
generally
scenery
oh
and
the
mercure
de
we
ll
get
along
said
my
uncle
so
long
as
you
don
t
annoy
me
said
moggs
lighting
a
cigarette
you
can
make
me
as
rich
as
you
we
certainly
made
him
no
poorer
his
was
the
first
firm
that
was
advertised
by
a
circumstantial
history
we
even
got
to
illustrated
magazine
articles
telling
of
the
quaint
past
of
moggs
we
concocted
moggsiana
trusting
to
our
partner
s
preoccupation
with
the
uncommercial
aspects
of
life
we
gave
graceful
history
of
moggs
the
first
moggs
the
second
moggs
the
third
and
moggs
the
fourth
you
must
unless
you
are
very
young
remember
some
of
them
and
our
admirable
block
of
a
georgian
shop
window
my
uncle
brought
early
memoirs
soaked
himself
in
the
style
and
devised
stories
about
old
moggs
the
first
and
the
duke
of
wellington
george
the
third
and
the
soap
dealer
almost
certainly
old
moggs
very
soon
we
had
added
to
the
original
moggs
primrose
several
varieties
of
scented
and
superfatted
a
special
nurseries
used
in
the
household
of
the
duke
of
kent
and
for
the
old
queen
in
infancy
a
plate
powder
the
paragon
and
a
knife
powder
we
roped
in
a
good
little
firm
and
carried
their
origins
back
into
the
mists
of
antiquity
it
was
my
uncle
s
own
unaided
idea
that
we
should
associate
that
commodity
with
the
black
prince
he
became
industriously
curious
about
the
past
of
i
remember
his
the
president
of
the
pepys
society
i
say
is
there
any
in
pepys
you
know
for
grates
or
does
he
pass
it
over
as
a
matter
of
course
he
became
in
those
days
the
terror
of
eminent
historians
don
t
want
your
drum
and
trumpet
history
no
fear
he
used
to
say
don
t
want
to
know
who
was
who
s
mistress
and
why
devastated
such
a
province
that
s
bound
to
be
all
lies
and
anyhow
not
my
affair
nobody
s
affair
now
chaps
who
did
it
didn
t
clearly
know
what
i
want
to
know
is
in
the
middle
ages
did
they
do
anything
for
housemaid
s
knee
what
did
they
put
in
their
hot
baths
after
jousting
and
was
the
black
prince
you
know
the
black
prince
was
he
enameled
or
painted
or
what
i
think
myself
very
likely
like
but
did
they
use
blacking
so
early
so
it
came
about
that
in
designing
and
writing
those
moggs
soap
advertisements
that
wrought
a
revolution
in
that
department
of
literature
my
uncle
was
brought
to
realise
not
only
the
lost
history
but
also
the
enormous
field
for
invention
and
enterprise
that
lurked
among
the
little
articles
the
dustpans
and
mincers
the
mousetraps
and
that
fringe
the
shops
of
the
oilman
and
domestic
ironmonger
he
was
recalled
to
one
of
the
dreams
of
his
youth
to
his
conception
of
the
ponderevo
patent
flat
that
had
been
in
his
mind
so
early
as
the
days
before
i
went
to
serve
him
at
wimblehurst
the
home
george
he
said
wants
straightening
up
silly
muddle
things
that
get
in
the
way
got
to
organise
for
a
time
he
displayed
something
like
the
zeal
of
a
genuine
social
reformer
in
relation
to
these
matters
we
ve
got
to
bring
the
home
up
to
date
that
s
my
idee
george
we
got
to
make
a
civilised
domestic
machine
out
of
these
relics
of
barbarism
i
m
going
to
hunt
up
inventors
make
a
corner
in
d
mestic
ideas
everything
balls
of
string
that
won
t
dissolve
into
a
tangle
and
gum
that
won
t
dry
into
horn
see
then
after
conveniences
beauty
beauty
george
all
these
few
things
ought
to
be
made
fit
to
look
at
it
s
your
aunt
s
idea
that
beautiful
get
one
of
those
new
art
chaps
to
design
all
the
things
they
make
ugly
now
patent
by
these
greenwood
chaps
housemaid
s
boxes
it
ll
be
a
pleasure
to
fall
over
rich
coloured
zzzz
pails
f
rinstance
hang
em
up
on
the
walls
like
all
the
polishes
and
things
in
such
tins
you
ll
want
to
cuddle
em
george
see
the
notion
sted
of
all
the
silly
ugly
things
we
we
had
some
magnificent
visions
they
so
affected
me
that
when
i
passed
ironmongers
and
they
seemed
to
me
as
full
of
promise
as
trees
in
late
winter
flushed
with
the
effort
to
burst
into
leaf
and
flower
and
really
we
did
do
much
towards
that
very
brightness
these
shops
display
they
were
dingy
things
in
the
eighties
compared
to
what
our
efforts
have
made
them
now
grey
quiet
displays
well
i
don
t
intend
to
write
down
here
the
tortuous
financial
history
of
moggs
limited
which
was
our
first
development
of
moggs
and
sons
nor
will
i
tell
very
much
of
how
from
that
we
spread
ourselves
with
a
larger
and
larger
conception
throughout
the
chandlery
and
minor
ironmongery
how
we
became
agents
for
this
little
commodity
partners
in
that
got
a
tentacle
round
the
neck
of
a
specialised
manufacturer
or
so
secured
a
pull
upon
this
or
that
supply
of
raw
material
and
so
prepared
the
way
for
our
second
flotation
domestic
utilities
do
it
they
reordered
it
in
the
city
and
then
came
the
reconstruction
of
and
then
household
services
and
the
boom
that
sort
of
development
is
not
to
be
told
in
detail
in
a
novel
i
have
indeed
told
much
of
it
elsewhere
it
is
to
be
found
set
out
at
length
painfully
at
length
in
my
uncle
s
examination
and
mine
in
the
bankruptcy
proceedings
and
in
my
own
various
statements
after
his
death
some
people
know
everything
in
that
story
some
know
it
all
too
well
most
do
not
want
the
details
it
is
the
story
of
a
man
of
imagination
among
figures
and
unless
you
are
prepared
to
collate
columns
of
pounds
shillings
and
pence
compare
dates
and
check
additions
you
will
find
it
very
unmeaning
and
perplexing
and
after
all
you
wouldn
t
find
the
early
figures
so
much
wrong
as
strained
in
the
matter
of
moggs
and
do
ut
as
in
the
first
promotion
and
in
its
reconstruction
we
left
the
court
by
city
standards
without
a
stain
on
our
characters
the
great
amalgamation
of
household
services
was
my
uncle
s
first
really
enterprise
and
his
first
display
of
bolder
methods
for
this
we
bought
back
do
ut
moggs
going
strong
with
a
seven
per
cent
dividend
and
acquired
skinnerton
s
polishes
the
riffleshaw
properties
and
the
runcorn
s
mincer
and
business
to
that
amalgamation
i
was
really
not
a
party
i
left
it
to
my
uncle
because
i
was
then
beginning
to
get
keen
upon
the
soaring
experiments
i
had
taken
on
from
the
results
then
to
hand
of
lilienthal
pilcher
and
the
wright
brothers
i
was
developing
a
glider
into
a
flyer
i
meant
to
apply
power
to
this
glider
as
soon
as
i
could
work
out
one
or
two
residual
problems
affecting
the
longitudinal
stability
i
knew
that
i
had
a
sufficiently
light
motor
in
my
own
modification
of
bridger
s
light
turbine
but
i
knew
too
that
until
i
had
cured
my
aeroplane
of
a
tendency
demanding
constant
alertness
from
me
a
tendency
to
jerk
up
its
nose
at
unexpected
moments
and
slide
back
upon
me
the
application
of
an
engine
would
be
little
short
of
suicide
but
that
i
will
tell
about
later
the
point
i
was
coming
to
was
that
i
did
not
realise
until
after
the
crash
how
recklessly
my
uncle
had
kept
his
promise
of
paying
a
dividend
of
over
eight
per
cent
on
the
ordinary
shares
of
that
hugely
enterprise
household
services
i
drifted
out
of
business
affairs
into
my
research
much
more
than
either
i
or
my
uncle
had
contemplated
finance
was
much
less
to
my
taste
than
the
organisation
of
the
factory
in
the
new
field
of
enterprise
there
was
a
great
deal
of
bluffing
and
gambling
of
taking
chances
and
concealing
material
facts
and
these
are
hateful
things
to
the
scientific
type
of
mind
it
wasn
t
fear
i
felt
so
much
as
an
uneasy
inaccuracy
i
didn
t
realise
dangers
i
simply
disliked
the
sloppy
relaxing
quality
of
this
new
sort
of
work
i
was
at
last
constantly
making
excuses
not
to
come
up
to
him
in
london
the
latter
part
of
his
business
career
recedes
therefore
beyond
the
circle
of
any
particular
life
i
lived
more
or
less
with
him
i
talked
i
advised
i
helped
him
at
times
to
fight
his
sunday
crowd
at
crest
hill
but
i
did
not
follow
nor
guide
him
from
the
do
ut
time
onward
he
rushed
up
the
financial
world
like
a
bubble
in
water
and
left
me
like
some
busy
down
below
in
the
deeps
anyhow
he
was
an
immense
success
the
public
was
i
think
particularly
attracted
by
the
homely
familiarity
of
his
field
of
work
you
never
lost
sight
of
your
investment
they
felt
with
the
name
on
the
and
and
its
allegiance
was
secured
by
the
egyptian
solidity
of
his
apparent
results
after
its
reconstruction
paid
thirteen
moggs
seven
domestic
utilities
had
been
a
nine
here
was
household
services
with
eight
on
such
a
showing
he
had
merely
to
buy
and
sell
roeburn
s
antiseptic
fluid
razor
soaks
and
bath
crystals
in
three
weeks
to
clear
twenty
thousand
pounds
i
do
think
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
roeburn
s
was
good
value
at
the
price
at
which
he
gave
it
to
the
public
at
least
until
it
was
strained
by
advertisement
it
was
a
period
of
expansion
and
confidence
much
money
was
seeking
investment
and
industrials
were
the
fashion
prices
were
rising
all
round
there
remained
little
more
for
my
uncle
to
do
therefore
in
his
climb
to
the
high
unstable
crest
of
financial
greatness
but
as
he
said
to
grasp
the
cosmic
oyster
george
while
it
gaped
which
being
translated
meant
for
him
to
buy
respectable
businesses
confidently
and
courageously
at
the
vendor
s
estimate
add
thirty
or
forty
thousand
to
the
price
and
sell
them
again
his
sole
difficulty
indeed
was
the
tactful
management
of
the
load
of
shares
that
each
of
these
transactions
left
upon
his
hands
but
i
thought
so
little
of
these
later
things
that
i
never
fully
appreciated
the
peculiar
inconveniences
of
that
until
it
was
too
late
to
help
him
iii
when
i
think
of
my
uncle
near
the
days
of
his
great
boom
and
in
connection
with
the
actualities
of
his
enterprises
i
think
of
him
as
i
used
to
see
him
in
the
suite
of
rooms
he
occupied
in
the
hardingham
hotel
seated
at
a
great
old
oak
smoking
drinking
and
incoherently
busy
that
was
his
typical
financial
aspect
our
evenings
our
mornings
our
holidays
our
expeditions
lady
grove
and
crest
hill
belong
to
an
altogether
different
set
of
memories
these
rooms
in
the
hardingham
were
a
string
of
apartments
along
one
handsome
corridor
all
the
doors
upon
the
corridor
were
locked
except
the
first
and
my
uncle
s
bedroom
and
private
sanctum
were
the
least
accessible
and
served
by
an
entrance
from
the
adjacent
passage
which
he
also
used
at
times
as
a
means
of
escape
from
importunate
callers
the
most
eternal
room
was
a
general
and
very
in
quality
it
had
one
or
two
uneasy
sofas
a
number
of
chairs
a
green
baize
table
and
a
collection
of
the
very
best
moggs
and
tone
posters
and
the
plush
carpets
normal
to
the
hardingham
had
been
replaced
by
a
cork
linoleum
here
i
would
always
find
a
remarkable
miscellany
of
people
presided
over
by
a
peculiarly
faithful
and
ferocious
looking
commissioner
ropper
who
guarded
the
door
that
led
a
step
nearer
my
uncle
usually
there
would
be
a
parson
or
so
and
one
or
two
widows
hairy
eyeglassy
gentlemen
some
of
them
looking
singularly
like
edward
ponderevos
who
hadn
t
come
off
a
variety
of
young
and
youngish
men
more
or
less
attractively
dressed
some
with
papers
protruding
from
their
pockets
others
with
their
papers
decently
concealed
and
wonderful
incidental
frowsy
people
all
these
persons
maintained
a
practically
hopeless
siege
sometimes
for
weeks
together
they
had
better
have
stayed
at
home
next
came
a
room
full
of
people
who
had
some
sort
of
appointment
and
here
one
would
find
people
brilliantly
dressed
nervous
women
hiding
behind
magazines
nonconformist
divines
clergy
in
gaiters
real
business
men
these
latter
for
the
most
part
gentlemen
in
admirable
morning
dress
who
stood
up
and
scrutinised
my
uncle
s
taste
in
water
colours
manfully
and
sometimes
by
the
hour
together
young
men
again
were
here
of
various
social
origins
young
americans
treasonable
clerks
from
other
concerns
university
young
men
most
of
them
resolute
reserved
but
on
a
sort
of
hair
trigger
ready
at
any
moment
to
be
most
voluble
most
persuasive
this
room
had
a
window
too
looking
out
into
the
hotel
courtyard
with
its
fountains
and
mosaic
pavement
and
the
young
men
would
stand
against
this
and
sometimes
even
mutter
one
day
i
heard
one
repeating
in
all
urgent
whisper
as
i
passed
but
you
don
t
quite
see
ponderevo
the
full
advantages
the
full
advantages
i
met
his
eye
and
he
was
embarrassed
then
came
a
room
with
a
couple
of
secretaries
no
typewriters
because
my
uncle
hated
the
clatter
and
a
casual
person
or
two
sitting
about
projectors
whose
projects
were
being
entertained
here
and
in
a
further
room
nearer
the
private
apartments
my
uncle
s
correspondence
underwent
an
exhaustive
process
of
pruning
and
digestion
before
it
reached
him
then
the
two
little
rooms
in
which
my
uncle
talked
my
magic
uncle
who
had
got
the
investing
public
to
whom
all
things
were
possible
as
one
came
in
we
would
find
him
squatting
with
his
cigar
up
and
an
expression
of
dubious
beatitude
upon
his
face
while
some
one
urged
him
to
grow
still
richer
by
this
or
that
that
ju
george
he
used
to
say
come
in
here
s
a
thing
tell
him
mister
over
again
have
a
drink
george
no
wise
man
liss
i
was
always
ready
to
listen
all
sorts
of
financial
marvels
came
out
of
the
hardingham
more
particularly
during
my
uncle
s
last
great
flurry
but
they
were
nothing
to
the
projects
that
passed
in
it
was
the
little
brown
and
gold
room
he
sat
in
usually
he
had
had
it
redecorated
by
bordingly
and
half
a
dozen
sussex
pictures
by
webster
hung
about
it
latterly
he
wore
a
velveteen
jacket
of
a
colour
in
this
apartment
that
i
think
its
esthetic
intention
and
he
also
added
some
gross
chinese
bronzes
he
was
on
the
whole
a
very
happy
man
throughout
all
that
wildly
enterprising
time
he
made
and
as
i
shall
tell
in
its
place
spent
great
sums
of
money
he
was
constantly
in
violent
motion
constantly
stimulated
mentally
and
physically
and
rarely
tired
about
him
was
an
atmosphere
of
immense
deference
much
of
his
waking
life
was
triumphal
and
all
his
dreams
i
doubt
if
he
had
any
dissatisfaction
with
himself
at
all
until
the
crash
bore
him
down
things
must
have
gone
very
rapidly
with
him
i
think
he
must
have
been
very
happy
as
i
sit
here
writing
about
all
these
things
jerking
down
notes
and
throwing
them
aside
in
my
attempt
to
give
some
literary
form
to
the
tale
of
our
promotions
the
marvel
of
it
all
comes
to
me
as
if
it
came
for
the
first
time
the
supreme
unreason
of
it
at
the
climax
of
his
boom
my
uncle
at
the
most
sparing
estimate
must
have
possessed
in
substance
and
credit
about
two
million
pounds
of
property
to
set
off
against
his
vague
colossal
liabilities
and
from
first
to
last
he
must
have
had
a
controlling
influence
in
the
direction
of
nearly
thirty
millions
this
irrational
muddle
of
a
community
in
which
we
live
gave
him
that
paid
him
at
that
rate
for
sitting
in
a
room
and
scheming
and
telling
it
lies
for
he
created
nothing
he
invented
nothing
he
economised
nothing
i
can
not
claim
that
a
single
one
of
the
great
businesses
we
organised
added
any
real
value
to
human
life
at
all
several
like
were
unmitigated
frauds
by
any
honest
standard
the
giving
of
nothing
coated
in
advertisements
for
money
and
the
things
the
hardingham
gave
out
i
repeat
were
nothing
to
the
things
that
came
in
i
think
of
the
long
procession
of
people
who
sat
down
before
us
and
propounded
this
and
that
now
it
was
a
device
for
selling
bread
under
a
fancy
name
and
so
escaping
the
laws
as
to
weight
this
was
afterwards
floated
as
the
decorticated
company
and
bumped
against
the
law
now
it
was
a
new
scheme
for
still
more
strident
advertisement
now
it
was
a
story
of
unsuspected
deposits
of
minerals
now
a
cheap
and
nasty
substitute
for
this
or
that
common
necessity
now
the
treachery
of
a
too
employee
anxious
to
become
our
partner
it
was
all
put
to
us
tentatively
persuasively
sometimes
one
had
a
large
pink
blusterous
person
trying
to
carry
us
off
our
feet
by
his
frankness
now
some
dyspeptically
yellow
whisperer
now
some
earnest
specially
dressed
youth
with
an
and
a
buttonhole
now
some
shrewd
manchester
man
or
some
scotchman
eager
to
be
very
clear
and
full
many
came
in
couples
or
trios
often
in
tow
of
an
explanatory
solicitor
some
were
white
and
earnest
some
flustered
beyond
measure
at
their
opportunity
some
of
them
begged
and
prayed
to
be
taken
up
my
uncle
chose
what
he
wanted
and
left
the
rest
he
became
very
autocratic
to
these
applicants
he
felt
he
could
make
them
and
they
felt
so
too
he
had
but
to
say
no
and
they
faded
out
of
existence
he
had
become
a
sort
of
vortex
to
which
wealth
flowed
of
its
own
accord
his
possessions
increased
by
heaps
his
shares
his
leaseholds
and
mortgages
and
debentures
behind
his
things
he
found
it
necessary
at
last
and
sanctioned
by
all
the
precincts
to
set
up
three
general
trading
companies
the
london
and
african
investment
company
the
british
traders
loan
company
and
business
organisations
limited
this
was
in
the
culminating
time
when
i
had
least
to
do
with
affairs
i
don
t
say
that
with
any
desire
to
exculpate
myself
i
admit
i
was
a
director
of
all
three
and
i
will
confess
i
was
willfully
incurious
in
that
capacity
each
of
these
companies
ended
its
financial
year
solvent
by
selling
great
holdings
of
shares
to
one
or
other
of
its
sisters
and
paying
a
dividend
out
of
the
proceeds
i
sat
at
the
table
and
agreed
that
was
our
method
of
equilibrium
at
the
iridescent
climax
of
the
bubble
you
perceive
now
however
the
nature
of
the
services
for
which
this
fantastic
community
have
him
unmanageable
wealth
and
power
and
real
respect
it
was
all
a
monstrous
payment
for
courageous
fiction
a
gratuity
in
return
for
the
one
reality
of
human
life
illusion
we
gave
them
a
feeling
of
hope
and
profit
we
sent
a
tidal
wave
of
water
and
confidence
into
their
stranded
affairs
we
mint
faith
george
said
my
uncle
one
day
that
s
what
we
do
and
by
jove
we
got
to
keep
minting
we
been
making
human
confidence
ever
since
i
drove
the
first
cork
of
coining
would
have
been
a
better
word
than
minting
and
yet
you
know
in
a
sense
he
was
right
civilisation
is
possible
only
through
confidence
so
that
we
can
bank
our
money
and
go
unarmed
about
the
streets
the
bank
reserve
or
a
policeman
keeping
order
in
a
jostling
multitude
of
people
are
only
slightly
less
impudent
bluffs
than
my
uncle
s
prospectuses
they
couldn
t
for
a
moment
make
good
if
the
quarter
of
what
they
guarantee
was
demanded
of
them
the
whole
of
this
modern
mercantile
investing
civilisation
is
indeed
such
stuff
as
dreams
are
made
of
a
mass
of
people
swelters
and
toils
great
railway
systems
grow
cities
arise
to
the
skies
and
spread
wide
and
far
mines
are
opened
factories
hum
foundries
roar
ships
plough
the
seas
countries
are
settled
about
this
busy
striving
world
the
rich
owners
go
controlling
all
enjoying
all
confident
and
creating
the
confidence
that
draws
us
all
together
into
a
reluctant
nearly
unconscious
brotherhood
i
wonder
and
plan
my
engines
the
flags
flutter
the
crowds
cheer
the
legislatures
meet
yet
it
seems
to
me
indeed
at
times
that
all
this
present
commercial
civilisation
is
no
more
than
my
poor
uncle
s
career
writ
large
a
swelling
thinning
bubble
of
assurances
that
its
arithmetic
is
just
as
unsound
its
dividends
as
its
ultimate
aim
as
vague
and
forgotten
that
it
all
drifts
on
perhaps
to
some
tremendous
parallel
to
his
individual
disaster
well
so
it
was
we
boomed
and
for
four
years
and
a
half
we
lived
a
life
of
mingled
substance
and
moonshine
until
our
particular
unsoundness
overtook
us
we
went
about
in
the
most
magnificent
of
upon
tangible
high
roads
made
ourselves
conspicuous
and
stately
in
splendid
houses
ate
sumptuously
and
had
a
perpetual
stream
of
notes
and
money
trickling
into
our
pockets
hundreds
of
thousands
of
men
and
women
respected
us
saluted
us
and
gave
us
toil
and
honour
i
asked
and
my
worksheets
rose
my
aeroplanes
swooped
out
of
nothingness
to
scare
the
downland
my
uncle
waved
his
hand
and
lady
grove
and
all
its
associations
of
chivalry
and
ancient
peace
were
his
waved
again
and
architects
were
busy
planning
the
great
palace
he
never
finished
at
crest
hill
and
an
army
of
folkmen
gathered
to
do
his
bidding
blue
marble
came
from
canada
and
timber
from
new
zealand
and
beneath
it
all
you
know
there
was
nothing
but
fictitious
values
as
evanescent
as
rainbow
gold
iv
i
pass
the
hardingham
ever
and
again
and
glance
aside
through
the
great
archway
at
the
fountain
and
the
ferns
and
think
of
those
receding
days
when
i
was
so
near
the
centre
of
our
eddy
of
greed
and
enterprise
i
see
again
my
uncle
s
face
white
and
intent
and
hear
him
discourse
hear
him
make
consciously
napoleonic
decisions
grip
his
nettles
put
his
finger
on
the
spot
bluff
say
he
became
particularly
addicted
to
the
last
idiom
towards
the
end
every
conceivable
act
took
the
form
of
saying
snap
the
odd
fish
that
came
to
us
and
among
others
came
that
queer
blend
of
romance
and
illegality
who
was
destined
to
drag
me
into
the
most
irrelevant
adventure
in
my
life
the
mordet
island
affair
and
leave
me
as
they
say
with
blood
upon
my
hands
it
is
remarkable
how
little
it
troubles
my
conscience
and
how
much
it
stirs
my
imagination
that
particular
memory
of
the
life
i
took
the
story
of
mordet
island
has
been
told
in
a
government
report
and
told
all
wrong
there
are
still
excellent
reasons
for
leaving
it
wrong
in
places
but
the
liveliest
appeals
of
discretion
forbid
my
leaving
it
out
altogether
i
ve
still
the
vividest
memory
of
s
appearance
in
the
inner
sanctum
a
lank
sunburnt
person
in
tweeds
with
a
hatchet
face
and
one
faded
blue
eye
the
other
was
a
closed
and
sunken
lid
and
how
he
told
us
with
a
stiff
affectation
of
ease
his
incredible
story
of
this
great
heap
of
quap
that
lay
abandoned
or
undiscovered
on
the
beach
behind
mordet
s
island
among
white
dead
mangroves
and
the
black
ooze
of
brackish
water
what
s
quap
said
my
uncle
on
the
fourth
repetition
of
the
word
they
call
it
quap
or
quab
or
quabb
said
but
our
relations
weren
t
friendly
enough
to
get
the
accent
right
but
there
the
stuff
is
for
the
taking
they
don
t
know
about
it
nobody
knows
about
it
i
got
down
to
the
damned
place
in
a
canoe
alone
the
boys
wouldn
t
come
i
pretended
to
be
to
begin
with
was
inclined
to
be
dramatic
look
here
he
said
when
he
first
came
in
shutting
the
door
rather
carefully
behind
him
as
he
spoke
do
you
two
men
yes
or
no
want
to
put
up
six
thousand
for
a
clear
good
chance
of
fifteen
hundred
per
cent
on
your
money
in
a
year
we
re
always
getting
chances
like
that
said
my
uncle
cocking
his
cigar
offensively
wiping
his
glasses
and
tilting
his
chair
back
we
stick
to
a
safe
s
quick
temper
showed
in
a
slight
stiffening
of
his
attitude
don
t
you
believe
him
said
i
getting
up
before
he
could
reply
you
re
different
and
i
know
your
books
we
re
very
glad
you
ve
come
to
us
confound
it
uncle
its
sit
down
what
is
it
minerals
quap
said
fixing
his
eye
on
me
in
in
heaps
said
my
uncle
softly
with
his
glasses
very
oblique
you
re
only
fit
for
the
grocery
said
scornfully
sitting
down
and
helping
himself
to
one
of
my
uncle
s
cigars
i
m
sorry
i
came
but
still
now
i
m
here
and
first
as
to
quap
quap
sir
is
the
most
stuff
in
the
world
that
s
quap
it
s
a
festering
mass
of
earths
and
heavy
metals
polonium
radium
ythorium
thorium
carium
and
new
things
too
there
s
a
stuff
called
xk
provisionally
there
they
are
mucked
up
together
in
a
sort
of
rotting
sand
what
it
is
how
it
got
made
i
don
t
know
it
s
like
as
if
some
young
creator
had
been
playing
about
there
there
it
lies
in
two
heaps
one
small
one
great
and
the
world
for
miles
about
it
is
blasted
and
scorched
and
dead
you
can
have
it
for
the
getting
you
ve
got
to
take
it
that
s
all
that
sounds
all
right
said
i
have
you
samples
well
should
i
you
can
have
anything
up
to
two
where
is
it
his
blue
eye
smiled
at
me
and
scrutinised
me
he
smoked
and
was
fragmentary
for
a
time
fending
off
my
questions
then
his
story
began
to
piece
itself
together
he
conjured
up
a
vision
of
this
strange
forgotten
kink
in
the
world
s
littoral
of
the
long
meandering
channels
that
spread
and
divaricate
and
spend
their
burden
of
mud
and
silt
within
the
thunderbelt
of
atlantic
surf
of
the
dense
tangled
vegetation
that
creeps
into
the
shimmering
water
with
root
and
sucker
he
gave
a
sense
of
heat
and
a
perpetual
reek
of
vegetable
decay
and
told
how
at
last
comes
a
break
among
these
things
an
arena
fringed
with
dead
trees
a
sight
of
the
sea
line
beyond
the
dazzling
surf
and
a
wide
desolation
of
dirty
shingle
and
mud
bleached
and
scarred
a
little
way
off
among
charred
dead
weeds
stands
the
abandoned
station
abandoned
because
every
man
who
stayed
two
months
at
that
station
stayed
to
die
eaten
up
mysteriously
like
a
leper
with
its
dismantled
sheds
and
its
decaying
pier
of
wormrotten
and
oblique
piles
and
planks
still
insecurely
possible
and
in
the
midst
two
clumsy
heaps
shaped
like
the
backs
of
hogs
one
small
one
great
sticking
out
under
a
rib
of
rock
that
cuts
the
space
across
quap
there
it
is
said
worth
three
pounds
an
ounce
if
it
s
worth
a
penny
two
great
heaps
of
it
rotten
stuff
and
soft
ready
to
shovel
and
wheel
and
you
may
get
it
by
the
ton
how
did
it
get
there
god
knows
there
it
is
for
the
taking
in
a
country
where
you
mustn
t
trade
in
a
country
where
the
company
waits
for
good
kind
men
to
find
it
riches
and
then
take
em
away
from
em
there
you
have
it
can
t
you
do
any
sort
of
deal
they
re
too
damned
stupid
you
ve
got
to
go
and
take
it
that
s
they
might
catch
they
might
of
course
but
they
re
not
great
at
we
went
into
the
particulars
of
that
difficulty
they
wouldn
t
catch
me
because
i
d
sink
first
give
me
a
yacht
said
that
s
all
i
but
if
you
get
caught
said
my
uncle
i
am
inclined
to
think
imagined
we
would
give
him
a
cheque
for
six
thousand
pounds
on
the
strength
of
his
talk
it
was
very
good
talk
but
we
didn
t
do
that
i
stipulated
for
samples
of
his
stuff
for
analysis
and
he
consented
reluctantly
i
think
on
the
whole
he
would
rather
i
didn
t
examine
samples
he
made
a
motion
pocketwards
that
gave
us
an
invincible
persuasion
that
he
had
a
sample
upon
him
and
that
at
the
last
instant
he
decided
not
to
produce
it
prematurely
there
was
evidently
a
curious
strain
of
secretiveness
in
him
he
didn
t
like
to
give
us
samples
and
he
wouldn
t
indicate
within
three
hundred
miles
the
position
of
this
mordet
island
of
his
he
had
it
clear
in
his
mind
that
he
had
a
secret
of
immense
value
and
he
had
no
idea
at
all
of
just
how
far
he
ought
to
go
with
business
people
and
so
presently
to
gain
time
for
these
hesitations
of
his
he
began
to
talk
of
other
things
he
talked
very
well
he
talked
of
the
dutch
east
indies
and
of
the
congo
of
portuguese
east
africa
and
paraguay
of
malays
and
rich
chinese
merchants
dyaks
and
negroes
and
the
spread
of
the
mahometan
world
in
africa
and
all
this
time
he
was
trying
to
judge
if
we
were
good
enough
to
trust
with
his
adventure
our
cosy
inner
office
became
a
little
place
and
all
our
business
cold
and
lifeless
exploits
beside
his
glimpses
of
strange
minglings
of
men
of
slayings
unavenged
and
curious
customs
of
trade
where
no
writs
run
and
the
dark
treacheries
of
eastern
ports
and
uncharted
channels
we
had
neither
of
us
gone
abroad
except
for
a
few
vulgar
raids
on
paris
our
world
was
england
are
the
places
of
origin
of
half
the
raw
material
of
the
goods
we
sold
had
seemed
to
us
as
remote
as
fairyland
or
the
forest
of
arden
but
made
it
so
real
and
intimate
for
us
that
afternoon
for
me
at
any
rate
that
it
seemed
like
something
seen
and
forgotten
and
now
again
remembered
and
in
the
end
he
produced
his
sample
a
little
lump
of
muddy
clay
speckled
with
brownish
grains
in
a
glass
bottle
wrapped
about
with
lead
and
flannel
red
flannel
it
was
i
remember
a
hue
which
is
i
know
popularly
supposed
to
double
all
the
mystical
efficacies
of
flannel
don
t
carry
it
about
on
you
said
it
makes
a
i
took
the
stuff
to
thorold
and
thorold
had
the
exquisite
agony
of
discovering
two
new
elements
in
what
was
then
a
confidential
analysis
he
has
christened
them
and
published
since
but
at
the
time
wouldn
t
hear
for
a
moment
of
our
publication
of
any
facts
at
all
indeed
he
flew
into
a
violent
passion
and
abused
me
mercilessly
even
for
showing
the
stuff
to
thorold
i
thought
you
were
going
to
analyse
it
yourself
he
said
with
the
touching
persuasion
of
the
layman
that
a
scientific
man
knows
and
practises
at
the
sciences
i
made
some
commercial
inquiries
and
there
seemed
even
then
much
truth
in
s
estimate
of
the
value
of
the
stuff
it
was
before
the
days
of
capern
s
discovery
of
the
value
of
canadium
and
his
use
of
it
in
the
capern
filament
but
the
cerium
and
thorium
alone
were
worth
the
money
he
extracted
for
the
then
in
vogue
there
were
however
doubts
indeed
there
were
numerous
doubts
what
were
the
limits
of
the
trade
how
much
thorium
not
to
speak
of
cerium
could
they
take
at
a
maximum
suppose
that
quantity
was
high
enough
to
justify
our
shipload
came
doubts
in
another
quarter
were
the
heaps
up
to
sample
were
they
as
big
as
he
said
was
imaginative
and
if
these
values
held
could
we
after
all
get
the
stuff
it
wasn
t
ours
it
was
on
forbidden
ground
you
see
there
were
doubts
of
every
grade
and
class
in
the
way
of
this
adventure
we
went
some
way
nevertheless
in
the
discussion
of
his
project
though
i
think
we
tried
his
patience
then
suddenly
he
vanished
from
london
and
i
saw
no
more
of
him
for
a
year
and
a
half
my
uncle
said
that
was
what
he
had
expected
and
when
at
last
reappeared
and
mentioned
in
an
incidental
way
that
he
had
been
to
paraguay
on
private
and
we
guessed
passionate
affairs
the
business
of
the
quap
expedition
had
to
be
begun
again
at
the
beginning
my
uncle
was
disposed
to
be
altogether
sceptical
but
i
wasn
t
so
decided
i
think
i
was
drawn
by
its
picturesque
aspects
but
we
neither
of
us
dreamt
of
touching
it
seriously
until
capern
s
discovery
nasmyth
s
story
had
laid
hold
of
my
imagination
like
one
small
intense
picture
of
tropical
sunshine
hung
on
a
wall
of
grey
business
affairs
i
kept
it
going
during
s
intermittent
appearances
in
england
every
now
and
then
he
and
i
would
meet
and
reinforce
its
effect
we
would
lunch
in
london
or
he
would
cone
to
see
my
gliders
at
crest
hill
and
make
new
projects
for
getting
at
those
heaps
again
now
with
me
now
alone
at
times
they
became
a
sort
of
with
us
an
imaginative
exercise
and
there
came
capern
s
discovery
of
what
he
called
the
ideal
filament
and
with
it
an
altogether
less
problematical
quality
about
the
business
side
of
quap
for
the
ideal
filament
needed
five
per
cent
of
canadium
and
canadium
was
known
to
the
world
only
as
a
newly
separated
constituent
of
a
variety
of
the
rare
mineral
rutile
but
to
thorold
it
was
better
known
as
an
element
in
a
mysterious
sample
brought
to
him
by
me
and
to
me
it
was
known
as
one
of
the
elements
in
quap
i
told
my
uncle
and
we
jumped
on
to
the
process
at
once
we
found
that
still
unaware
of
the
altered
value
of
the
stuff
and
still
thinking
of
the
experimental
prices
of
radium
and
the
rarity
value
of
cerium
had
got
hold
of
a
cousin
named
pollack
made
some
extraordinary
transaction
about
his
life
insurance
policy
and
was
buying
a
brig
we
put
in
put
down
three
thousand
pounds
and
forthwith
the
life
insurance
transaction
and
the
pollack
side
of
this
finance
vanished
into
thin
air
leaving
pollack
i
regret
to
say
in
the
brig
and
in
the
secret
except
so
far
as
canadium
and
the
filament
went
as
residuum
we
discussed
earnestly
whether
we
should
charter
a
steamer
or
go
on
with
the
brig
but
we
decided
on
the
brig
as
a
less
conspicuous
instrument
for
an
enterprise
that
was
after
all
to
put
it
plainly
stealing
but
that
was
one
of
our
last
enterprises
before
our
great
crisis
and
i
will
tell
of
it
in
its
place
so
it
was
quap
came
into
our
affairs
came
in
as
a
and
became
real
more
and
more
real
it
grew
until
at
last
it
was
real
until
at
last
i
saw
with
my
eyes
the
heaps
my
imagination
had
seen
for
so
long
and
felt
between
my
fingers
again
that
half
soft
texture
of
quap
like
sanded
mixed
with
clay
in
which
there
stirs
something
one
must
feel
it
to
understand
v
all
sorts
of
things
came
to
the
hardingham
and
offered
themselves
to
my
uncle
stands
but
only
because
he
played
a
part
at
last
in
the
crisis
of
our
fortunes
so
much
came
to
us
that
it
seemed
to
me
at
times
as
though
the
whole
world
of
human
affairs
was
ready
to
prostitute
itself
to
our
real
and
imaginary
millions
as
i
look
back
i
am
still
dazzled
and
incredulous
to
think
of
the
quality
of
our
opportunities
we
did
the
most
extraordinary
things
things
that
it
seems
absurd
to
me
to
leave
to
any
casual
man
of
wealth
and
enterprise
who
cares
to
do
them
i
had
some
amazing
perceptions
of
just
how
modern
thought
and
the
supply
of
fact
to
the
general
mind
may
be
controlled
by
money
among
other
things
that
my
uncle
offered
for
he
tried
very
hard
to
buy
the
british
medical
journal
and
the
lancet
and
run
them
on
what
he
called
modern
lines
and
when
they
resisted
him
he
talked
very
vigorously
for
a
time
of
organising
a
rival
enterprise
that
was
a
very
magnificent
idea
indeed
in
its
way
it
would
have
given
a
tremendous
advantage
in
the
handling
of
innumerable
specialties
and
indeed
i
scarcely
know
how
far
it
would
not
have
put
the
medical
profession
in
our
grip
it
still
amazes
me
i
shall
die
amazed
that
such
a
thing
can
be
possible
in
the
modern
state
if
my
uncle
failed
to
bring
the
thing
off
some
one
else
may
succeed
but
i
doubt
even
if
he
had
got
both
these
weeklies
whether
his
peculiar
style
would
have
suited
them
the
change
of
purpose
would
have
shown
he
would
have
found
it
difficult
to
keep
up
their
dignity
he
certainly
did
not
keep
up
the
dignity
of
the
sacred
grove
an
important
critical
organ
which
he
acquired
one
day
by
saying
snap
for
eight
hundred
pounds
he
got
it
lock
stock
and
barrel
under
one
or
other
of
which
three
aspects
the
editor
was
included
even
at
that
price
it
didn
t
pay
if
you
are
a
literary
person
you
will
remember
the
bright
new
cover
he
gave
that
representative
organ
of
british
intellectual
culture
and
how
his
sound
business
instincts
jarred
with
the
exalted
pretensions
of
a
vanishing

the
best
pill
in
the
world
for
an
irregular
liver
i
suppose
it
is
some
lingering
traces
of
the
bladesover
tradition
to
me
that
makes
this
combination
of
letters
and
pills
seem
so
incongruous
just
as
i
suppose
it
is
a
lingering
trace
of
plutarch
and
my
ineradicable
boyish
imagination
that
at
bottom
our
state
should
be
wise
sane
and
dignified
that
makes
me
think
a
country
which
leaves
its
medical
and
literary
criticism
or
indeed
any
such
vitally
important
criticism
entirely
to
private
enterprise
and
open
to
the
advances
of
any
purchaser
must
be
in
a
frankly
hopeless
condition
these
are
ideal
conceptions
of
mine
as
a
matter
of
fact
nothing
would
be
more
entirely
natural
and
representative
of
the
relations
of
learning
thought
and
the
economic
situation
in
the
world
at
the
present
time
than
this
cover
of
the
sacred
grove
the
quiet
conservatism
of
the
one
element
embedded
in
the
aggressive
brilliance
of
the
other
the
contrasted
notes
of
bold
physiological
experiment
and
extreme
mental
immobility
vi
there
comes
back
too
among
these
hardingham
memories
an
impression
of
a
drizzling
november
day
and
how
we
looked
out
of
the
windows
upon
a
procession
of
the
london
unemployed
it
was
like
looking
down
a
well
into
some
momentarily
revealed
nether
world
some
thousands
of
needy
ineffectual
men
had
been
raked
together
to
trail
their
spiritless
misery
through
the
west
eire
with
an
appeal
that
was
also
in
its
way
a
weak
and
insubstantial
threat
it
is
work
we
need
not
there
they
were
through
the
fog
a
silent
interminable
grey
procession
they
carried
wet
dirty
banners
they
rattled
boxes
for
pence
these
men
who
had
not
said
snap
in
the
right
place
the
men
who
had
snapped
too
eagerly
the
men
who
had
never
said
snap
the
men
who
had
never
had
a
chance
of
saying
a
shambling
shameful
stream
they
made
oozing
along
the
street
the
gutter
waste
of
competitive
civilisation
and
we
stood
high
out
of
it
all
as
high
as
if
we
looked
godlike
from
another
world
standing
in
a
room
beautifully
lit
and
furnished
skillfully
warmed
filled
with
costly
things
there
thought
i
but
for
the
grace
of
god
go
george
and
edward
but
my
uncle
s
thoughts
ran
in
a
different
channel
and
he
made
that
vision
the
test
of
a
spirited
but
inconclusive
harangue
upon
tariff
reform
chapter
the
second
our
progress
from
camden
town
to
crest
hill
i
so
far
my
history
of
my
aunt
and
uncle
has
dealt
chiefly
with
his
industrial
and
financial
exploits
but
side
by
side
with
that
history
of
inflation
from
the
infinitesimal
to
the
immense
is
another
development
the
change
year
by
year
from
the
shabby
impecuniosity
of
the
camden
town
lodging
to
the
lavish
munificence
of
the
crest
hill
marble
staircase
and
my
aunt
s
golden
bed
the
bed
that
was
facsimiled
from
fontainebleau
and
the
odd
thing
is
that
as
i
come
to
this
nearer
part
of
my
story
i
find
it
much
more
difficult
to
tell
than
the
clear
little
perspective
memories
of
the
earlier
days
impressions
crowd
upon
one
another
and
overlap
one
another
i
was
presently
to
fall
in
love
again
to
be
seized
by
a
passion
to
which
i
still
faintly
respond
a
passion
that
still
clouds
my
mind
i
came
and
went
between
ealing
and
my
aunt
and
uncle
and
presently
between
effie
and
clubland
and
then
between
business
and
a
life
of
research
that
became
far
more
continuous
infinitely
more
consecutive
and
memorable
than
any
of
these
other
sets
of
experiences
i
didn
t
witness
a
regular
social
progress
therefore
my
aunt
and
uncle
went
up
in
the
world
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
as
if
they
were
displayed
by
an
early
cinematograph
with
little
jumps
and
flickers
as
i
recall
this
side
of
our
life
the
figure
of
my
aunt
susan
tends
always
to
the
central
position
we
drove
the
car
and
sustained
the
car
she
sat
in
it
with
a
magnificent
variety
of
headgear
poised
upon
her
delicate
neck
and
always
with
that
faint
ghost
of
a
lisp
no
misspelling
can
render
commented
on
and
illuminated
the
new
aspects
i
ve
already
sketched
the
little
home
behind
the
wimblehurst
chemist
s
shop
the
lodging
near
the
cobden
statue
and
the
apartments
in
gower
street
thence
my
aunt
and
uncle
went
into
a
flat
in
redgauntlet
mansions
there
they
lived
when
i
married
it
was
a
compact
flat
with
very
little
for
a
woman
to
do
in
it
in
those
days
my
aunt
i
think
used
to
find
the
time
heavy
upon
her
hands
and
so
she
took
to
books
and
reading
and
after
a
time
even
to
going
to
lectures
in
the
afternoon
i
began
to
find
unexpected
books
upon
her
table
sociological
books
travels
shaw
s
plays
hullo
i
said
at
the
sight
of
some
volume
of
the
latter
i
m
keeping
a
mind
george
she
explained
eh
keeping
a
mind
dogs
i
never
cared
for
it
s
been
a
between
setting
up
a
mind
and
setting
up
a
soul
it
s
jolly
lucky
for
him
and
you
it
s
a
mind
i
ve
joined
the
london
library
and
i
m
going
in
for
the
royal
institution
and
every
blessed
lecture
that
comes
along
next
winter
you
d
better
look
and
i
remember
her
coming
in
late
one
evening
with
a
in
her
hand
where
ya
been
susan
said
my
uncle
birkbeck
physiology
i
m
getting
she
sat
down
and
took
off
her
gloves
you
re
just
glass
to
me
she
sighed
and
then
in
a
note
of
grave
reproach
you
old
package
i
had
no
idea
the
things
you
ve
kept
from
me
presently
they
were
setting
up
the
house
at
beckengham
and
my
aunt
intermitted
her
intellectual
activities
the
house
at
beckengham
was
something
of
an
enterprise
for
them
at
that
time
a
reasonably
large
place
by
the
standards
of
the
early
years
of
it
was
a
big
rather
gaunt
villa
with
a
conservatory
and
a
shrubbery
a
a
quite
considerable
vegetable
garden
and
a
small
disused
i
had
some
glimpses
of
the
excitements
of
its
inauguration
but
not
many
because
of
the
estrangement
between
my
aunt
and
marion
my
aunt
went
into
that
house
with
considerable
zest
and
my
uncle
distinguished
himself
by
the
thoroughness
with
which
he
did
the
repainting
and
replumbing
he
had
all
the
drains
up
and
most
of
the
garden
with
them
and
stood
administrative
on
heaps
administrating
whisky
to
the
workmen
i
found
him
there
one
day
most
napoleonic
on
a
little
elba
of
dirt
in
an
atmosphere
that
defies
print
he
also
i
remember
chose
what
he
considered
cheerful
contrasts
of
colours
for
the
painting
of
the
woodwork
this
exasperated
my
aunt
extremely
she
called
him
a
pestilential
old
splosher
with
an
unusual
note
of
earnestness
and
he
also
enraged
her
into
novelties
of
abuse
by
giving
each
bedroom
the
name
of
some
favourite
hero
cliff
napoleon
caesar
and
so
forth
and
having
it
painted
on
the
door
in
gilt
letters
on
a
black
label
martin
luther
was
kept
for
me
only
her
respect
for
domestic
discipline
she
said
prevented
her
retaliating
with
old
pondo
on
the
housemaid
s
cupboard
also
he
went
and
ordered
one
of
the
completest
sets
of
garden
requisites
i
have
ever
seen
and
had
them
all
painted
a
hard
clear
blue
my
aunt
got
herself
large
tins
of
a
kindlier
hued
enamel
and
had
everything
secretly
recoated
and
this
done
she
found
great
joy
in
the
garden
and
became
an
ardent
rose
grower
and
herbaceous
borderer
leaving
her
mind
indeed
to
damp
evenings
and
the
winter
months
when
i
think
of
her
at
beckenham
i
always
think
first
of
her
as
dressed
in
that
blue
cotton
stuff
she
affected
with
her
arms
in
huge
gauntleted
gardening
gloves
a
trowel
in
one
hand
and
a
small
but
no
doubt
hardy
and
promising
annual
limp
and
very
and
sheepish
in
the
other
beckenham
in
the
persons
of
a
vicar
a
doctor
s
wife
and
a
large
proud
lady
called
hogberry
called
on
my
uncle
and
aunt
almost
at
once
so
soon
in
fact
as
the
lawn
was
down
again
and
afterwards
my
aunt
made
friends
with
a
quiet
gentlewoman
next
door
a
propos
of
an
overhanging
cherry
tree
and
the
need
of
repairing
the
party
fence
so
she
resumed
her
place
in
society
from
which
she
had
fallen
with
the
disaster
of
wimblehurst
she
made
a
partially
facetious
study
of
the
etiquette
of
her
position
had
cards
engraved
and
retaliated
calls
and
then
she
received
a
card
for
one
of
hogberry
s
at
homes
gave
an
old
garden
party
herself
participated
in
a
bazaar
and
sale
of
work
and
was
really
becoming
quite
cheerfully
entangled
in
beckenham
society
when
she
was
suddenly
taken
up
by
the
roots
again
by
my
uncle
and
transplanted
to
chiselhurst
old
trek
george
she
said
compactly
onward
and
up
when
i
found
her
superintending
the
loading
of
two
big
furniture
vans
go
up
and
say
to
martin
luther
and
then
i
ll
see
what
you
can
do
to
help
ii
i
look
into
the
jumbled
stores
of
the
middle
distance
of
memory
and
beckenham
seems
to
me
a
quite
transitory
phase
but
really
they
were
there
several
years
through
nearly
all
my
married
life
in
fact
and
far
longer
than
the
year
and
odd
months
we
lived
together
at
wimblehurst
but
the
wimblehurst
time
with
them
is
fuller
in
my
memory
by
far
then
the
beckenham
period
there
comes
back
to
me
with
a
quite
considerable
amount
of
detail
the
effect
of
that
garden
party
of
my
aunt
s
and
of
a
little
social
misbehaviour
of
which
i
was
guilty
on
that
occasion
it
s
like
a
scrap
from
another
life
it
s
all
set
in
what
is
for
me
a
kind
of
cutaneous
feeling
the
feeling
of
rather
city
clothes
frock
coat
and
grey
trousers
and
of
a
high
collar
and
tie
worn
in
sunshine
among
flowers
i
have
still
a
quite
vivid
memory
of
the
little
trapezoidal
lawn
of
the
gathering
and
particularly
of
the
hats
and
feathers
of
the
gathering
of
the
and
the
blue
and
of
the
magnificent
presence
of
hogberry
and
of
her
clear
resonant
voice
it
was
a
voice
that
would
have
gone
with
a
garden
party
on
a
larger
scale
it
went
into
adjacent
premises
it
included
the
gardener
who
was
far
up
the
vegetable
patch
and
technically
out
of
play
the
only
other
men
were
my
aunt
s
doctor
two
of
the
clergy
amiable
contrasted
men
and
hogberry
s
imperfectly
son
a
youth
just
bursting
into
collar
the
rest
were
women
except
for
a
young
girl
or
so
in
a
state
of
speechless
good
behaviour
marion
also
was
there
marion
and
i
had
arrived
a
little
estranged
and
i
remember
her
as
a
silent
presence
a
shadow
across
all
that
sunlit
emptiness
of
intercourse
we
had
embittered
each
other
with
one
of
those
miserable
little
disputes
that
seemed
so
unavoidable
between
us
she
had
with
the
help
of
smithie
dressed
rather
elaborately
for
the
occasion
and
when
she
saw
me
prepared
to
accompany
her
in
i
think
it
was
a
grey
suit
she
protested
that
silk
hat
and
frock
coat
were
imperative
i
was
recalcitrant
she
quoted
an
illustrated
paper
showing
a
garden
party
with
the
king
present
and
finally
i
capitulated
but
after
my
evil
habit
resentfully
eh
dear
those
old
quarrels
how
pitiful
they
were
how
trivial
and
how
sorrowful
they
are
to
recall
i
think
they
grow
more
sorrowful
as
i
grow
older
and
all
the
small
passionate
reasons
for
our
mutual
anger
fade
and
fade
out
of
memory
the
impression
that
beckenham
company
has
left
on
my
mind
is
one
of
a
modest
unreality
they
were
all
maintaining
a
front
of
unspecified
social
pretension
and
evading
the
display
of
the
economic
facts
of
the
case
most
of
the
husbands
were
in
business
off
stage
it
would
have
been
outrageous
to
ask
what
the
business
was
and
the
wives
were
giving
their
energies
to
produce
with
the
assistance
of
novels
and
the
illustrated
magazines
a
moralised
version
of
the
afternoon
life
of
the
aristocratic
class
they
hadn
t
the
intellectual
or
moral
enterprise
of
the
woman
they
had
no
political
interests
they
had
no
views
about
anything
and
consequently
they
were
i
remember
extremely
difficult
to
talk
to
they
all
sat
about
in
the
and
in
and
were
very
hatty
and
ruffley
and
sunshady
three
ladies
and
the
curate
played
croquet
with
a
general
immense
gravity
broken
by
occasional
loud
cries
of
feigned
distress
from
the
curate
oh
whacking
me
about
again
augh
the
dominant
social
fact
that
afternoon
was
hogberry
she
took
up
a
certain
position
commanding
the
croquet
and
went
on
as
my
aunt
said
to
me
in
an
incidental
aside
like
an
old
she
talked
of
the
way
in
which
beckenham
society
was
getting
mixed
and
turned
on
to
a
touching
letter
she
had
recently
received
from
her
former
nurse
at
little
gossdean
followed
a
loud
account
of
little
gossdean
and
how
much
she
and
her
eight
sisters
had
been
looked
up
to
there
my
poor
mother
was
quite
a
little
queen
there
she
said
and
such
nice
common
people
people
say
the
country
labourers
are
getting
disrespectful
nowadays
it
isn
t
so
not
if
they
re
properly
treated
here
of
course
in
beckenham
it
s
different
i
won
t
call
the
people
we
get
here
a
poor
they
re
certainly
not
a
proper
poor
they
re
masses
i
always
tell
bugshoot
they
re
masses
and
ought
to
be
treated
as
dim
memories
of
mackridge
floated
through
my
mind
as
i
listened
to
her
i
was
whirled
on
this
roundabout
for
a
bit
and
then
had
the
fortune
to
fall
off
into
a
with
a
lady
whom
my
aunt
introduced
as
mumble
but
then
she
introduced
everybody
to
me
as
mumble
that
afternoon
either
by
way
of
humour
or
necessity
that
must
have
been
one
of
my
earliest
essays
in
the
art
of
polite
conversation
and
i
remember
that
i
began
by
criticising
the
local
railway
service
and
that
at
the
third
sentence
or
thereabouts
mumble
said
in
a
distinctly
bright
and
encouraging
way
that
she
feared
i
was
a
very
frivolous
person
i
wonder
now
what
it
was
i
said
that
was
i
don
t
know
what
happened
to
end
that
conversation
or
if
it
had
an
end
i
remember
talking
to
one
of
the
clergy
for
a
time
rather
awkwardly
and
being
given
a
sort
of
topographical
history
of
beckenham
which
he
assured
me
time
after
time
was
quite
an
old
place
quite
an
old
as
though
i
had
treated
it
as
new
and
he
meant
to
be
very
patient
but
very
convincing
then
we
hung
up
in
a
distinct
pause
and
my
aunt
rescued
me
george
she
said
in
a
confidential
undertone
keep
the
pot
and
then
audibly
i
say
will
you
both
old
trot
about
with
tea
a
bit
only
too
delighted
to
trot
for
you
ponderevo
said
the
clergyman
becoming
fearfully
expert
and
in
his
elements
only
too
i
found
we
were
near
a
rustic
table
and
that
the
housemaid
was
behind
us
in
a
suitable
position
to
catch
us
on
the
rebound
with
the
tea
things
trot
repeated
the
clergyman
to
me
much
amused
excellent
expression
and
i
just
saved
him
from
the
tray
as
he
turned
about
we
handed
tea
for
a
while
give
em
cakes
said
my
aunt
flushed
but
well
in
hand
helps
em
to
talk
george
always
talk
best
after
a
little
nourishment
like
throwing
a
bit
of
turf
down
an
old
she
surveyed
the
gathering
with
a
predominant
blue
eye
and
helped
herself
to
tea
they
keep
on
going
stiff
she
said
in
an
undertone
i
ve
done
my
it
s
been
a
huge
success
i
said
encouragingly
that
boy
has
had
his
legs
crossed
in
that
position
and
hasn
t
spoken
for
ten
minutes
stiffer
and
stiffer
brittle
he
s
beginning
a
dry
cough
always
a
bad
sign
george
walk
em
about
shall
i
rub
their
noses
with
snow
happily
she
didn
t
i
got
myself
involved
with
the
gentlewoman
from
next
door
a
pensive
little
woman
with
a
low
voice
and
fell
talking
our
topic
cats
and
dogs
and
which
it
was
we
liked
best
i
always
feel
said
the
pensive
little
woman
that
there
s
something
about
a
dog
a
cat
hasn
t
got
yes
i
found
myself
admitting
with
great
enthusiasm
there
is
something
and
yet
again
oh
i
know
there
s
something
about
a
cat
too
but
it
isn
t
the
not
quite
the
same
i
admitted
but
still
it
s
ah
but
such
a
different
something
more
much
ever
so
much
it
makes
all
the
difference
don
t
you
think
yes
i
said
she
glanced
at
me
gravely
and
sighed
a
long
deeply
felt
a
long
pause
the
thing
seemed
to
me
to
amount
to
a
fear
came
into
my
heart
and
much
perplexity
the
er
roses
i
said
i
felt
like
a
drowning
man
those
roses
don
t
you
think
they
are
very
beautiful
flowers
aren
t
they
she
agreed
gently
there
seems
to
be
something
in
roses
something
i
don
t
know
how
to
express
something
i
said
helpfully
yes
she
said
something
isn
t
there
so
few
people
see
it
i
said
more
s
the
pity
she
sighed
and
said
again
very
softly
there
was
another
long
pause
i
looked
at
her
and
she
was
thinking
dreamily
the
drowning
sensation
returned
the
fear
and
enfeeblement
i
perceived
by
a
sort
of
inspiration
that
her
was
empty
let
me
take
your
cup
i
said
abruptly
and
that
secured
made
for
the
table
by
the
i
had
no
intention
then
of
deserting
my
aunt
but
close
at
hand
the
big
french
window
of
the
yawned
inviting
and
suggestive
i
can
feel
all
that
temptation
now
and
particularly
the
provocation
of
my
collar
in
an
instant
i
was
lost
i
would
just
for
a
moment
i
dashed
in
put
down
the
cup
on
the
keys
of
the
grand
piano
and
fled
upstairs
softly
swiftly
three
steps
at
a
time
to
the
sanctuary
of
my
uncle
s
study
his
snuggery
i
arrived
there
breathless
convinced
there
was
no
return
for
me
i
was
very
glad
and
ashamed
of
myself
and
desperate
by
means
of
a
penknife
i
contrived
to
break
open
his
cabinet
of
cigars
drew
a
chair
to
the
window
took
off
my
coat
collar
and
tie
and
remained
smoking
guiltily
and
rebelliously
and
peeping
through
the
blind
at
the
assembly
on
the
lawn
until
it
was
altogether
gone
the
clergymen
i
thought
were
wonderful
iii
a
few
such
pictures
of
those
early
days
at
beckenham
stand
out
and
then
i
find
myself
among
the
chiselhurst
memories
the
chiselhurst
mansion
had
grounds
rather
than
a
mere
garden
and
there
was
a
gardener
s
cottage
and
a
little
lodge
at
the
gate
the
ascendant
movement
was
always
far
more
in
evidence
there
than
at
beckenham
the
velocity
was
increasing
one
night
picks
itself
out
as
typical
as
in
its
way
marking
an
epoch
i
was
there
i
think
about
some
advertisement
stuff
on
some
sort
of
business
anyhow
and
my
uncle
and
aunt
had
come
back
in
a
fly
from
a
dinner
at
the
runcorns
even
there
he
was
nibbling
at
runcorn
with
the
idea
of
our
great
amalgamation
budding
in
his
mind
i
got
down
there
i
suppose
about
eleven
i
found
the
two
of
them
sitting
in
the
study
my
aunt
on
a
with
a
whimsical
pensiveness
on
her
face
regarding
my
uncle
and
he
much
extended
and
very
rotund
in
the
low
drawn
up
to
the
fender
look
here
george
said
my
uncle
after
my
first
greetings
i
just
been
saying

aren
t

socially
old

means
george
french
oh
didn
t
think
of
french
one
never
knows
where
to
have
him
what
s
gone
wrong
i
been
thinking
it
isn
t
any
particular
thing
i
ate
too
much
of
that
fishy
stuff
at
first
like
salt
frog
spawn
and
was
a
bit
confused
by
olives
and
well
i
didn
t
know
which
wine
was
which
had
to
say
that
each
time
it
puts
your
talk
all
wrong
and
she
wasn
t
in
evening
dress
not
like
the
others

can
t
go

my
uncle

tries
to
pass
it
off
as
humorous
my
aunt

a
grimace
it
isn
t
humorous
see

re
on
the
now

my
aunt

bladder

said
my
uncle
glancing
at
his
contours
and
suddenly
sitting
up
my
aunt
raised
her
eyebrows
slightly
swung
her
foot
and
said
nothing
we
aren
t
keeping
pace
with
our
own
progress
george

got

themselves

i
regarded

full
of
apprehensions

darkly

the
cigar
deepening
our
dread

pocketed
his
and
spoke
again

had
a
tendency

stick

my
clothes
said
my
aunt
however
who
cares
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
i
had
never
seen
my
uncle
so
immensely
serious
got
to
get
the
hang
of
etiquette
he
went
on

we
he
mumbled
his
cigar
and
smoked
for
a
space
leaning
forward
and
looking
into
the
fire
what
is
it
he
asked
after
all
what

jes
the

wrong
jes
the
shibboleth
he
was
silent
again
and
the
cigar
crept
up
from
the
horizontal
towards
the
zenith
as
the
confidence
of
his
mouth
increased
learn
the
whole
bag
of
tricks
in
six
he
said
becoming
more
cheerful
ah
susan
beat
it
out
george
you
in
particular

to
get
hold
of
it
ought
to
get
into
a
good
club
and
all
always
ready
to
learn
i
said
ever
since
you
gave
me
the
chance
of
latin
so
far
we
don
t
seem
to
have
hit
upon
any
stratum
in
the
we
ve
come
to
french
said
my
aunt
it
s
a
very
useful
language
said
my
uncle
put
a
point
on
things
zzzz
as
for
accent
no
englishman
has
an
accent
no
englishman
pronounces
french
properly
don
t
you
tell
me
it
s
a
it
s
all
a
bluff
life
s
a
bluff
practically
that
s
why
it
s
so
important
susan
for
us
to
attend
to
style
le
steel
say
lum
the
style
it
s
the
man
whad
you
laughing
at
susan
george
you
re
not
smoking
these
cigars
are
good
for
the
mind
what
do
you
think
of
it
all
we
got
to
adapt
ourselves
we
have
so
far
not
going
to
be
beat
by
these
silly
iv
what
do
you
think
of
it
george
he
insisted
what
i
said
i
thought
of
it
i
don
t
now
recall
only
i
have
very
distinctly
the
impression
of
meeting
for
a
moment
my
aunt
s
impenetrable
eye
and
anyhow
he
started
in
with
his
accustomed
energy
to
rape
the
mysteries
of
the
costly
life
and
become
the
calmest
of
its
lords
on
the
whole
i
think
he
did
it
thoroughly
i
have
crowded
memories
a
little
difficult
to
disentangle
of
his
experimental
stages
his
experimental
proceedings
it
s
hard
at
times
to
say
which
memory
comes
in
front
of
which
i
recall
him
as
presenting
on
the
whole
a
series
of
small
surprises
as
being
again
and
again
unexpectedly
a
little
more
a
little
more
polished
a
little
richer
and
finer
a
little
more
aware
of
the
positions
and
values
of
things
and
men
there
was
a
time
it
must
have
been
very
early
when
i
saw
him
deeply
impressed
by
the
splendours
of
the
of
the
national
liberal
club
heaven
knows
who
our
host
was
or
what
that
particular
little
feed
was
about
now
all
that
sticks
is
the
impression
of
our
straggling
entry
a
string
of
six
or
seven
guests
and
my
uncle
looking
about
him
at
the
numerous
bright
tables
at
the
exotics
in
great
majolica
jars
at
the
shining
ceramic
columns
and
pilasters
at
the
impressive
portraits
of
liberal
statesmen
and
heroes
and
all
that
contributes
to
the
ensemble
of
that
palatial
spectacle
he
was
betrayed
into
a
whisper
to
me
this
is
all
right
george
he
said
that
artless
comment
seems
almost
incredible
as
i
set
it
down
there
came
a
time
so
speedily
when
not
even
the
clubs
of
new
york
could
have
overawed
my
uncle
and
when
he
could
walk
through
the
bowing
magnificence
of
the
royal
grand
hotel
to
his
chosen
table
in
that
aggressively
exquisite
gallery
upon
the
river
with
all
the
easy
calm
of
one
of
earth
s
legitimate
kings
the
two
of
them
learnt
the
new
game
rapidly
and
well
they
experimented
abroad
they
experimented
at
home
at
chiselhurst
with
the
aid
of
a
new
very
costly
but
highly
instructive
cook
they
tried
over
everything
they
heard
of
that
roused
their
curiosity
and
had
any
reputation
for
difficulty
from
asparagus
to
plover
s
eggs
they
afterwards
got
a
gardener
who
could
wait
at
table
and
he
brought
the
soil
home
to
one
then
there
came
a
butler
i
remember
my
aunt
s
first
very
brightly
and
how
she
stood
before
the
fire
in
the
confessing
once
unsuspected
pretty
arms
with
all
the
courage
she
possessed
and
looking
over
her
shoulder
at
herself
in
a
mirror
a
ham
she
remarked
reflectively
must
feel
like
this
just
a
i
attempted
i
think
some
commonplace
compliment
my
uncle
appeared
at
the
door
in
a
white
waistcoat
and
with
his
hands
in
his
trouser
pockets
he
halted
and
surveyed
her
critically
couldn
t
tell
you
from
a
duchess
susan
he
remarked
i
d
like
to
have
you
painted
standin
at
the
fire
like
that
sargent
you
look
spirited
somehow
lord
i
wish
some
of
those
damned
tradesmen
at
wimblehurst
could
see
they
did
a
lot
of
at
hotels
and
sometimes
i
went
down
with
them
we
seemed
to
fall
into
a
vast
drifting
crowd
of
social
learners
i
don
t
know
whether
it
is
due
simply
to
my
changed
circumstances
but
it
seems
to
me
there
have
been
immensely
disproportionate
developments
of
the
and
population
during
the
last
twenty
years
it
is
not
only
i
think
that
there
are
crowds
of
people
who
like
we
were
are
in
the
economically
ascendant
phase
but
whole
masses
of
the
prosperous
section
of
the
population
must
be
altering
its
habits
giving
up
for
dinner
and
taking
to
evening
dress
using
the
hotels
as
a
for
these
new
social
arts
a
swift
and
systematic
conversion
to
gentility
has
been
going
on
i
am
convinced
throughout
the
whole
commercial
class
since
i
was
curiously
mixed
was
the
personal
quality
of
the
people
one
saw
in
these
raids
there
were
conscientiously
refined
and
people
reeking
with
proud
bashfulness
there
were
aggressively
smart
people
using
pet
diminutives
for
each
other
loudly
and
seeking
fresh
occasions
for
brilliant
rudeness
there
were
awkward
husbands
and
wives
quarrelling
furtively
about
their
manners
and
ill
at
ease
under
the
eye
of
the
winter
cheerfully
amiable
and
often
discrepant
couples
with
a
disposition
to
inconspicuous
corners
and
the
jolly
sort
affecting
an
unaffected
ease
plump
happy
ladies
who
laughed
too
loud
and
gentlemen
in
evening
dress
who
subsequently
got
their
and
nobody
you
knew
was
anybody
however
expensively
they
dressed
and
whatever
rooms
they
took
i
look
back
now
with
a
curious
remoteness
of
spirit
to
those
crowded
with
their
dispersed
tables
and
their
inevitable
lights
and
the
unsympathetic
unskillful
waiters
and
the
choice
of
thig
or
glear
sir
i
ve
not
dined
in
that
way
in
that
sort
of
place
now
for
five
years
it
must
be
quite
five
years
so
specialised
and
narrow
is
my
life
becoming
my
uncle
s
earlier
phases
work
in
with
these
associations
and
there
stands
out
a
little
bright
vignette
of
the
hall
of
the
magnificent
and
people
dressed
for
dinner
and
sitting
about
amidst
the
scarlet
furniture
satin
and
woodwork
until
the
gong
should
gather
them
and
my
aunt
is
there
very
marvelously
wrapped
about
in
a
dust
cloak
and
a
veil
and
there
are
hotel
porters
and
very
alert
and
an
obsequious
manager
and
the
tall
young
lady
in
black
from
the
office
is
surprised
into
admiration
and
in
the
middle
of
the
picture
is
my
uncle
making
his
first
appearance
in
that
esquimaux
costume
i
have
already
mentioned
a
short
figure
compactly
immense
hugely
goggled
wearing
a
sort
of
brown
rubber
proboscis
and
surmounted
by
a
of
motoring
cap
v
so
it
was
we
recognised
our
new
needs
as
fresh
invaders
of
the
upper
levels
of
the
social
system
and
set
ourselves
quite
consciously
to
the
acquisition
of
style
and
savoir
faire
we
became
part
of
what
is
nowadays
quite
an
important
element
in
the
confusion
of
our
world
that
multitude
of
economically
ascendant
people
who
are
learning
how
to
spend
money
it
is
made
up
of
financial
people
the
owners
of
the
businesses
that
are
eating
up
their
competitors
inventors
of
new
sources
of
wealth
such
as
ourselves
it
includes
nearly
all
america
as
one
sees
it
on
the
european
stage
it
is
a
various
multitude
having
only
this
in
common
they
are
all
moving
and
particularly
their
womankind
are
moving
from
conditions
in
which
means
were
insistently
finite
things
were
few
and
customs
simple
towards
a
limitless
expenditure
and
the
sphere
of
attraction
of
bond
street
fifth
avenue
and
paris
their
general
effect
is
one
of
progressive
revolution
of
limitless
rope
they
discover
suddenly
indulgences
their
moral
code
never
foresaw
and
has
no
provision
for
elaborations
ornaments
possessions
beyond
their
wildest
dreams
with
an
immense
astonished
zest
they
begin
shopping
begin
a
systematic
adaptation
to
a
new
life
crowded
and
brilliant
with
things
shopped
with
jewels
maids
butlers
coachmen
electric
broughams
hired
town
and
country
houses
they
plunge
into
it
as
one
plunges
into
a
career
as
a
class
they
talk
think
and
dream
possessions
their
literature
their
press
turns
all
on
that
immense
illustrated
weeklies
of
unsurpassed
magnificence
guide
them
in
domestic
architecture
in
the
art
of
owning
a
garden
in
the
achievement
of
the
sumptuous
in
in
an
elaborate
sporting
equipment
in
the
purchase
and
control
of
their
estates
in
travel
and
stupendous
hotels
once
they
begin
to
move
they
go
far
and
fast
acquisition
becomes
the
substance
of
their
lives
they
find
a
world
organised
to
gratify
that
passion
in
a
brief
year
or
so
they
are
connoisseurs
they
join
in
the
plunder
of
the
eighteenth
century
buy
rare
old
books
fine
old
pictures
good
old
furniture
their
first
crude
conception
of
dazzling
suites
of
the
newly
perfect
is
replaced
almost
from
the
outset
by
a
jackdaw
dream
of
accumulating
costly
discrepant
old
things
i
seem
to
remember
my
uncle
taking
to
shopping
quite
suddenly
in
the
beckenham
days
and
in
the
early
chiselhurst
days
he
was
chiefly
interested
in
getting
money
and
except
for
his
onslaught
on
the
beckenham
house
bothered
very
little
about
his
personal
surroundings
and
possessions
i
forget
now
when
the
change
came
and
he
began
to
spend
some
accident
must
have
revealed
to
him
this
new
source
of
power
or
some
subtle
shifting
occurred
in
the
tissues
of
his
brain
he
began
to
spend
and
so
soon
as
he
began
to
shop
he
began
to
shop
violently
he
began
buying
pictures
and
then
oddly
enough
old
clocks
for
the
chiselhurst
house
he
bought
nearly
a
dozen
grandfather
clocks
and
three
copper
warming
pans
after
that
he
bought
much
furniture
then
he
plunged
into
art
patronage
and
began
to
commission
pictures
and
to
make
presents
to
churches
and
institutions
his
buying
increased
with
a
regular
acceleration
its
development
was
a
part
of
the
mental
changes
that
came
to
him
in
the
wild
excitements
of
the
last
four
years
of
his
ascent
towards
the
climax
he
was
a
furious
spender
he
shopped
with
large
unexpected
purchases
he
shopped
like
a
mind
seeking
expression
he
shopped
to
astonish
and
dismay
shopped
crescendo
shopped
fortissimo
con
molto
espressione
until
the
magnificent
smash
of
crest
hill
eroded
his
shopping
for
ever
always
it
was
he
who
shopped
my
aunt
did
not
shine
as
a
purchaser
it
is
a
curious
thing
due
to
i
know
not
what
fine
strain
in
her
composition
that
my
aunt
never
set
any
great
store
upon
possessions
she
plunged
through
that
crowded
bazaar
of
vanity
fair
during
those
feverish
years
spending
no
doubt
freely
and
largely
but
spending
with
detachment
and
a
touch
of
humorous
contempt
for
the
things
even
the
old
things
that
money
can
buy
it
came
to
me
suddenly
one
afternoon
just
how
detached
she
was
as
i
saw
her
going
towards
the
hardingham
sitting
up
as
she
always
did
rather
stiffly
in
her
electric
brougham
regarding
the
glittering
world
with
interested
and
ironically
innocent
blue
eyes
from
under
the
brim
of
a
hat
that
defied
comment
no
one
i
thought
would
sit
so
apart
if
she
hadn
t
dreams
and
what
are
her
dreams
i
d
never
thought
and
i
remember
too
an
outburst
of
scornful
description
after
she
had
lunched
with
a
party
of
women
at
the
imperial
cosmic
club
she
came
round
to
my
rooms
on
the
chance
of
finding
me
there
and
i
gave
her
tea
she
professed
herself
tired
and
cross
and
flung
herself
into
my
chair
george
she
cried
the
things
women
are
do
stink
of
money
lunching
i
asked
she
nodded
plutocratic
ladies
oriental
type
oh
like
a
burst
hareem
bragging
of
possessions
they
feel
you
they
feel
your
clothes
george
to
see
if
they
are
good
i
soothed
her
as
well
as
i
could
they
are
good
aren
t
they
i
said
it
s
the
old
pawnshop
in
their
blood
she
said
drinking
tea
and
then
in
infinite
disgust
they
run
their
hands
over
your
clothes
they
paw
i
had
a
moment
of
doubt
whether
perhaps
she
had
not
been
discovered
in
possession
of
unsuspected
forgeries
i
don
t
know
after
that
my
eyes
were
quickened
and
i
began
to
see
for
myself
women
running
their
hands
over
other
women
s
furs
scrutinising
their
lace
even
demanding
to
handle
jewelry
appraising
envying
testing
they
have
a
kind
of
etiquette
the
woman
who
feels
says
what
beautiful
sables
what
lovely
lace
the
woman
felt
admits
proudly
it
s
real
you
know
or
disavows
pretension
modestly
and
hastily
it
s
rot
in
each
other
s
houses
they
peer
at
the
pictures
handle
the
selvage
of
hangings
look
at
the
bottoms
of
china
i
wonder
if
it
is
the
old
pawnshop
in
the
blood
i
doubt
if
lady
drew
and
the
olympians
did
that
sort
of
thing
but
here
i
may
be
only
clinging
to
another
of
my
former
illusions
about
aristocracy
and
the
state
perhaps
always
possessions
have
been
booty
and
never
anywhere
has
there
been
such
a
thing
as
house
and
furnishings
native
and
natural
to
the
women
and
men
who
made
use
of
them
vi
for
me
at
least
it
marked
an
epoch
in
my
uncle
s
career
when
i
learnt
one
day
that
he
had
shopped
lady
grove
i
realised
a
fresh
wide
unpreluded
step
he
took
me
by
surprise
with
the
sudden
change
of
scale
from
such
portable
possessions
as
jewels
and
to
a
stretch
of
countryside
the
transaction
was
napoleonic
he
was
told
of
the
place
he
said
snap
there
were
no
preliminary
desirings
or
searchings
then
he
came
home
and
said
what
he
had
done
even
my
aunt
was
for
a
day
or
so
measurably
awestricken
by
this
exploit
in
purchase
and
we
both
went
down
with
him
to
see
the
house
in
a
mood
near
consternation
it
struck
us
then
as
a
very
lordly
place
indeed
i
remember
the
three
of
us
standing
on
the
terrace
that
looked
westward
surveying
the
windows
of
the
house
and
a
feeling
of
unwarrantable
intrusion
comes
back
to
me
lady
grove
you
know
is
a
very
beautiful
house
indeed
a
still
and
gracious
place
whose
seclusion
was
only
effectively
broken
with
the
toot
of
the
coming
of
the
an
old
catholic
family
had
died
out
in
it
century
by
century
and
was
now
altogether
dead
portions
of
the
fabric
are
thirteenth
century
and
its
last
architectural
revision
was
tudor
within
it
is
for
the
most
part
dark
and
chilly
save
for
two
or
three
favoured
rooms
and
its
hall
its
terrace
is
its
noblest
feature
a
very
wide
broad
lawn
it
is
bordered
by
a
low
stone
battlement
and
there
is
a
great
cedar
in
one
corner
under
whose
level
branches
one
looks
out
across
the
blue
distances
of
the
weald
blue
distances
that
are
made
extraordinarily
italian
in
quality
by
virtue
of
the
dark
masses
of
that
single
tree
it
is
a
very
high
terrace
southward
one
looks
down
upon
the
tops
of
wayfaring
trees
and
spruces
and
westward
on
a
steep
slope
of
beechwood
through
which
the
road
comes
one
turns
back
to
the
still
old
house
and
sees
a
grey
and
lichenous
facade
with
a
very
finely
arched
entrance
it
was
warmed
by
the
afternoon
light
and
touched
with
the
colour
of
a
few
neglected
roses
and
a
pyracanthus
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
most
modern
owner
conceivable
in
this
serene
fine
place
was
some
bearded
scholarly
man
in
a
black
cassock
and
or
some
very
grey
gentlewoman
and
there
was
my
uncle
holding
his
goggles
in
a
sealskin
glove
wiping
the
glass
with
a
and
asking
my
aunt
if
lady
grove
wasn
t
a
bit
of
all
my
aunt
made
him
no
answer
the
man
who
built
this
i
speculated
wore
armour
and
carried
a
there
s
some
of
it
inside
still
said
my
uncle
we
went
inside
an
old
woman
with
very
white
hair
was
in
charge
of
the
place
and
cringed
rather
obviously
to
the
new
master
she
evidently
found
him
a
very
strange
and
frightful
apparition
indeed
and
was
dreadfully
afraid
of
him
but
if
the
surviving
present
bowed
down
to
us
the
past
did
not
we
stood
up
to
the
dark
long
portraits
of
the
extinguished
race
one
was
a
holbein
and
looked
them
in
their
sidelong
eyes
they
looked
back
at
us
we
all
i
know
felt
the
enigmatical
quality
in
them
even
my
uncle
was
momentarily
embarrassed
i
think
by
that
invincibly
expression
it
was
just
as
though
after
all
he
had
not
bought
them
up
and
replaced
them
altogether
as
though
that
secretly
they
knew
better
and
could
smile
at
him
the
spirit
of
the
place
was
akin
to
bladesover
but
touched
with
something
older
and
remoter
that
armour
that
stood
about
had
once
served
in
if
indeed
it
had
not
served
in
battle
and
this
family
had
sent
its
blood
and
treasure
time
after
time
upon
the
most
romantic
quest
in
history
to
palestine
dreams
loyalties
place
and
honour
how
utterly
had
it
all
evaporated
leaving
at
last
the
final
expression
of
its
spirit
these
quaint
painted
smiles
these
smiles
of
triumphant
completion
it
had
evaporated
indeed
long
before
the
ultimate
durgan
had
died
and
in
his
old
age
he
had
cumbered
the
place
with
early
victorian
cushions
and
carpets
and
tapestry
and
invalid
appliances
of
a
type
even
more
extinct
it
seemed
to
us
than
the
crusades
yes
it
was
different
from
bladesover
bit
stuffy
george
said
my
uncle
they
hadn
t
much
idea
of
ventilation
when
this
was
one
of
the
panelled
rooms
was
with
presses
and
a
bed
might
be
the
ghost
room
said
my
uncle
but
it
did
not
seem
to
me
that
so
retiring
a
family
as
the
durgans
so
old
and
completely
exhausted
a
family
as
the
durgans
was
likely
to
haunt
anybody
what
living
thing
now
had
any
concern
with
their
honour
and
judgments
and
good
and
evil
deeds
ghosts
and
witchcraft
were
a
later
innovation
that
fashion
came
from
scotland
with
the
stuarts
afterwards
prying
for
epitaphs
we
found
a
marble
crusader
with
a
broken
nose
under
a
battered
canopy
of
fretted
stone
outside
the
restricted
limits
of
the
present
duffield
church
and
half
buried
in
nettles
ichabod
said
my
uncle
eh
we
shall
be
like
that
susan
some
day
i
m
going
to
clean
him
up
a
bit
and
put
a
railing
to
keep
off
the
old
saved
at
the
eleventh
hour
said
my
aunt
quoting
one
of
the
less
successful
advertisements
of
but
i
don
t
think
my
uncle
heard
her
it
was
by
our
captured
crusader
that
the
vicar
found
us
he
came
round
the
corner
at
us
briskly
a
little
out
of
breath
he
had
an
air
of
having
been
running
after
us
since
the
first
toot
of
our
horn
had
warned
the
village
of
our
presence
he
was
an
oxford
man
with
a
cadaverous
complexion
and
a
guardedly
respectful
manner
a
cultivated
intonation
and
a
general
air
of
accommodation
to
the
new
order
of
things
these
oxford
men
are
the
greeks
of
our
plutocratic
empire
he
was
a
tory
in
spirit
and
what
one
may
call
an
adapted
tory
by
stress
of
circumstances
that
is
to
say
he
was
no
longer
a
legitimist
he
was
prepared
for
the
substitution
of
new
lords
for
old
we
were
pill
vendors
he
knew
and
no
doubt
horribly
vulgar
in
soul
but
then
it
might
have
been
some
polygamous
indian
rajah
a
great
strain
on
a
good
man
s
tact
or
some
jew
with
an
inherited
expression
of
contempt
anyhow
we
were
english
and
neither
dissenters
nor
socialists
and
he
was
cheerfully
prepared
to
do
what
he
could
to
make
gentlemen
of
both
of
us
he
might
have
preferred
americans
for
some
reasons
they
are
not
so
obviously
taken
from
one
part
of
the
social
system
and
dumped
down
in
another
and
they
are
more
teachable
but
in
this
world
we
can
not
always
be
choosers
so
he
was
very
bright
and
pleasant
with
us
showed
us
the
church
gossiped
informingly
about
our
neighbours
on
the
countryside
tux
the
banker
lord
boom
the
magazine
and
newspaper
proprietor
lord
carnaby
that
great
sportsman
and
old
lady
osprey
and
finally
he
took
us
by
way
of
a
village
lane
three
children
bobbed
convulsively
with
eyes
of
terror
for
my
uncle
through
a
meticulous
garden
to
a
big
slovenly
vicarage
with
faded
victorian
furniture
and
a
faded
victorian
wife
who
gave
us
tea
and
introduced
us
to
a
confusing
family
dispersed
among
a
lot
of
disintegrating
basket
chairs
upon
the
edge
of
a
tennis
lawn
these
people
interested
me
they
were
a
common
type
no
doubt
but
they
were
new
to
me
there
were
two
lank
sons
who
had
been
playing
singles
at
tennis
youths
growing
black
moustaches
and
dressed
in
conscientiously
untidy
tweeds
and
unbuttoned
and
ungirt
norfolk
jackets
there
were
a
number
of
daughters
sensible
and
economical
in
their
costume
the
younger
still
with
long
legs
and
the
eldest
present
there
were
we
discovered
one
or
two
hidden
away
displaying
a
large
gold
cross
and
other
aggressive
ecclesiastical
symbols
there
were
two
or
three
a
retrieverish
mongrel
and
an
old
and
very
bernard
there
was
a
jackdaw
there
was
moreover
an
ambiguous
silent
lady
that
my
aunt
subsequently
decided
must
be
a
very
deaf
paying
guest
two
or
three
other
people
had
concealed
themselves
at
our
coming
and
left
unfinished
teas
behind
them
rugs
and
cushions
lay
among
the
chairs
and
two
of
the
latter
were
i
noted
covered
with
union
jacks
the
vicar
introduced
us
sketchily
and
the
faded
victorian
wife
regarded
my
aunt
with
a
mixture
of
conventional
scorn
and
abject
respect
and
talked
to
her
in
a
languid
persistent
voice
about
people
in
the
neighbourhood
whom
my
aunt
could
not
possibly
know
my
aunt
received
these
personalia
cheerfully
with
her
blue
eyes
flitting
from
point
to
point
and
coming
back
again
and
again
to
the
pinched
faces
of
the
daughters
and
the
cross
upon
the
eldest
s
breast
encouraged
by
my
aunt
s
manner
the
vicar
s
wife
grew
patronising
and
kindly
and
made
it
evident
that
she
could
do
much
to
bridge
the
social
gulf
between
ourselves
and
the
people
of
family
about
us
i
had
just
snatches
of
that
conversation
mrs
merridew
brought
him
quite
a
lot
of
money
her
father
i
believe
had
been
in
the
spanish
wine
trade
quite
a
lady
though
and
after
that
he
fell
off
his
horse
and
cracked
his
brain
pan
and
took
to
fishing
and
farming
i
m
sure
you
ll
like
to
know

the
daughter
had
a
disappointment
and
went
to
china
as
a
missionary
and
got
mixed
up
in
a
the
most
beautiful
silks
and
things
she
brought
back
you

hardly
believe
yes
they
gave
them
to
propitiate
her
you
see
they
didn

understand
the

flung
it
wide

conversed

of

more
spirited
daughters
listened
brightly
and
the
youths
lay
on
the
grass
at
our
feet
my
uncle
offered
them
cigars
but
they
both
declined
out
of
bashfulness
it
seemed
to
me
whereas
the
vicar
i
think
accepted
out
of
tact
when
we
were
not
looking
at
them
directly
these
young
men
would
kick
each
other
furtively
under
the
influence
of
my
uncle
s
cigar
the
vicar
s
mind
had
soared
beyond
the
limits
of
the
district
this
socialism
he
said
seems
making
great
my
uncle
shook
his
head
we
re
too
individualistic
in
this
country
for
that
sort
of
nonsense
he
said
everybody
s
business
is
nobody
s
business
that
s
where
they
go
they
have
some
intelligent
people
in
their
ranks
i
am
told
said
the
vicar
writers
and
so
forth
quite
a
distinguished
playwright
my
eldest
daughter
was
telling
me
i
forget
his
name
milly
dear
oh
she
s
not
here
painters
too
they
have
this
socialist
it
seems
to
me
is
part
of
the
unrest
of
the
age
but
as
you
say
the
spirit
of
the
people
is
against
it
in
the
country
at
any
rate
the
people
down
here
are
too
sturdily
independent
in
their
small
way
and
too
sensible
it
s
a
great
thing
for
duffield
to
have
lady
grove
occupied
again
he
was
saying
when
my
wandering
attention
came
back
from
some
attractive
casualty
in
his
wife
s
discourse
people
have
always
looked
up
to
the
house
and
considering
all
things
old
durgan
really
was
extraordinarily
good
extraordinarily
good
you
intend
to
give
us
a
good
deal
of
your
time
here
i
i
mean
to
do
my
duty
by
the
parish
said
my
uncle
i
m
sincerely
glad
to
hear
it
sincerely
we
ve
missed
the
house
influence
an
english
village
isn
t
complete
people
get
out
of
hand
life
grows
dull
the
young
people
drift
away
to
he
enjoyed
his
cigar
gingerly
for
a
moment
we
shall
look
to
you
to
liven
things
up
he
said
poor
man
my
uncle
cocked
his
cigar
and
removed
it
from
his
mouth
what
you
think
the
place
wants
he
asked
he
did
not
wait
for
an
answer
i
been
thinking
while
you
been
talking
things
one
might
do
cricket
a
good
english
game
sports
build
the
chaps
a
pavilion
perhaps
then
every
village
ought
to
have
a
miniature
rifle
said
the
vicar
provided
of
course
there
isn
t
a
constant
manage
that
all
right
said
my
uncle
thing
d
be
a
sort
of
long
shed
paint
it
red
british
colour
then
there
s
a
union
jack
for
the
church
and
the
village
school
paint
the
school
red
too
p
raps
not
enough
colour
about
now
too
grey
then
a
how
far
our
people
would
take
up
that
sort
of
thing
began
the
vicar
i
m
all
for
getting
that
good
old
english
spirit
back
again
said
my
uncle
merrymakings
lads
and
lasses
dancing
on
the
village
green
harvest
home
fairings
yule
log
all
the
rest
of
how
would
old
sally
glue
do
for
a
may
queen
asked
one
of
the
sons
in
the
slight
pause
that
followed
or
annie
glassbound
said
the
other
with
the
huge
virile
guffaw
of
a
young
man
whose
voice
has
only
recently
broken
sally
glue
is
explained
the
vicar
and
annie
glassbound
is
well
a
young
lady
of
extremely
generous
proportions
and
not
quite
right
you
know
not
quite
right
he
tapped
his
brow
generous
proportions
said
the
eldest
son
and
the
guffaws
were
renewed
you
see
said
the
vicar
all
the
brisker
girls
go
into
service
in
or
near
london
the
life
of
excitement
attracts
them
and
no
doubt
the
higher
wages
have
something
to
do
with
it
and
the
liberty
to
wear
finery
and
generally
freedom
from
restraint
so
that
there
might
be
a
little
difficulty
perhaps
to
find
a
may
queen
here
just
at
present
who
was
really
young
and
er
pretty
of
course
i
couldn
t
think
of
any
of
my
girls
or
anything
of
that
we
got
to
attract
em
back
said
my
uncle
that
s
what
i
feel
about
it
we
got
to
the
country
the
english
country
is
a
going
concern
still
just
as
the
established
church
if
you
ll
excuse
me
saying
it
is
a
going
concern
just
as
oxford
is
or
cambridge
or
any
of
those
old
fine
old
things
only
it
wants
fresh
capital
fresh
idees
and
fresh
methods
light
railways
f
rinstance
scientific
use
of
drainage
wire
fencing
machinery
all
the
vicar
s
face
for
one
moment
betrayed
dismay
perhaps
he
was
thinking
of
his
country
walks
amids
the
hawthorns
and
honeysuckle
there
s
great
things
said
my
uncle
to
be
done
on
mod
un
lines
with
village
jam
and
pickles
boiled
in
the
it
was
the
reverberation
of
this
last
sentence
in
my
mind
i
think
that
sharpened
my
sentimental
sympathy
as
we
went
through
the
straggling
village
street
and
across
the
trim
green
on
our
way
back
to
london
it
seemed
that
afternoon
the
most
tranquil
and
idyllic
collection
of
homes
you
can
imagine
thatch
still
lingered
on
a
whitewashed
cottage
or
two
pyracanthus
and
daffodils
abounded
and
an
unsystematic
orchard
or
so
was
white
with
blossom
above
and
gay
with
bulbs
below
i
noted
a
row
of
straw
beehives
beehives
of
the
type
long
since
condemned
as
inefficient
by
all
progressive
minds
and
in
the
doctor
s
acre
of
grass
a
flock
of
two
whole
sheep
was
grazing
no
doubt
he
d
taken
them
on
account
two
men
and
one
old
woman
made
gestures
of
abject
vassalage
and
my
uncle
replied
with
a
lordly
gesture
of
his
great
motoring
glove
england
s
full
of
bits
like
this
said
my
uncle
leaning
over
the
front
seat
and
looking
back
with
great
satisfaction
the
black
glare
of
his
goggles
rested
for
a
time
on
the
receding
turrets
of
lady
grove
just
peeping
over
the
trees
i
shall
have
a
flagstaff
i
think
he
considered
then
one
could
show
when
one
is
in
residence
the
villagers
will
like
to
i
reflected
they
will
i
said
they
re
used
to
liking
to
my
aunt
had
been
unusually
silent
suddenly
she
spoke
he
says
snap
she
remarked
he
buys
that
place
and
a
nice
old
job
of
housekeeping
he
gives
me
he
sails
through
the
village
swelling
like
an
old
turkey
and
who
ll
have
to
scoot
the
butler
me
who
s
got
to
forget
all
she
ever
knew
and
start
again
me
who
s
got
to
trek
from
chiselhurst
and
be
a
great
lady
me
you
old
bother
just
when
i
was
settling
down
and
beginning
to
feel
at
my
uncle
turned
his
goggles
to
her
ah
this
time
it
is
home
susan
we
got
vii
it
seems
to
me
now
but
a
step
from
the
buying
of
lady
grove
to
the
beginning
of
crest
hill
from
the
days
when
the
former
was
a
stupendous
achievement
to
the
days
when
it
was
too
small
and
dark
and
inconvenient
altogether
for
a
great
financier
s
use
for
me
that
was
a
period
of
increasing
detachment
from
our
business
and
the
great
world
of
london
i
saw
it
more
and
more
in
broken
glimpses
and
sometimes
i
was
working
in
my
little
pavilion
above
lady
grove
for
a
fortnight
together
even
when
i
came
up
it
was
often
solely
for
a
meeting
of
the
aeronautical
society
or
for
one
of
the
learned
societies
or
to
consult
literature
or
employ
searchers
or
some
such
special
business
for
my
uncle
it
was
a
period
of
stupendous
inflation
each
time
i
met
him
i
found
him
more
confident
more
comprehensive
more
consciously
a
factor
in
great
affairs
soon
he
was
no
longer
an
associate
of
merely
business
men
he
was
big
enough
for
the
attentions
of
greater
powers
i
grew
used
to
discovering
some
item
of
personal
news
about
him
in
my
evening
paper
or
to
the
sight
of
a
portrait
of
him
in
a
sixpenny
magazine
usually
the
news
was
of
some
munificent
act
some
romantic
piece
of
buying
or
giving
or
some
fresh
rumour
of
reconstruction
he
saved
you
will
remember
the
parbury
reynolds
for
the
country
or
at
times
it
would
be
an
interview
or
my
uncle
s
contribution
to
some
symposium
on
the
secret
of
success
or
topic
or
wonderful
tales
of
his
power
of
work
of
his
wonderful
organisation
to
get
things
done
of
his
instant
decisions
and
remarkable
power
of
judging
his
they
repeated
his
great
mot
eight
hour
working
day
i
want
eighty
hours
he
became
modestly
but
resolutely
they
cartooned
him
in
vanity
fair
one
year
my
aunt
looking
indeed
a
very
gracious
slender
lady
faced
the
portrait
of
the
king
in
the
great
room
at
burlington
house
and
the
next
year
saw
a
medallion
of
my
uncle
by
ewart
looking
out
upon
the
world
proud
and
imperial
but
on
the
whole
a
trifle
too
prominently
convex
from
the
walls
of
the
new
gallery
i
shared
only
intermittently
in
his
social
experiences
people
knew
of
me
it
is
true
and
many
of
them
sought
to
make
through
me
a
sort
of
flank
attack
upon
him
and
there
was
a
legend
owing
very
unreasonably
partly
to
my
growing
scientific
reputation
and
partly
to
an
element
of
reserve
in
my
manner
that
i
played
a
much
larger
share
in
planning
his
operations
than
was
actually
the
case
this
led
to
one
or
two
very
intimate
private
dinners
to
my
inclusion
in
one
or
two
house
parties
and
various
odd
offers
of
introductions
and
services
that
i
didn
t
for
the
most
part
accept
among
other
people
who
sought
me
in
this
way
was
archie
garvell
now
a
smart
impecunious
soldier
of
no
particular
distinction
who
would
i
think
have
been
quite
prepared
to
develop
any
sporting
instincts
i
possessed
and
who
was
beautifully
unaware
of
our
former
contact
he
was
always
offering
me
winners
no
doubt
in
a
spirit
of
anticipatory
exchange
for
some
really
good
thing
in
our
more
scientific
and
certain
method
of
getting
something
for
nothing
in
spite
of
my
preoccupation
with
my
experiments
work
i
did
i
find
now
that
i
come
to
ransack
my
impressions
see
a
great
deal
of
the
great
world
during
those
eventful
years
i
had
a
near
view
of
the
machinery
by
which
an
astounding
empire
is
run
rubbed
shoulders
and
exchanged
experiences
with
bishops
and
statesmen
political
women
and
women
who
were
not
political
physicians
and
soldiers
artists
and
authors
the
directors
of
great
journals
philanthropists
and
all
sorts
of
eminent
significant
people
i
saw
the
statesmen
without
their
orders
and
the
bishops
with
but
a
little
purple
silk
left
over
from
their
canonicals
inhaling
not
incensen
but
cigar
smoke
i
could
look
at
them
all
the
better
because
for
the
most
part
they
were
not
looking
at
me
but
at
my
uncle
and
calculating
consciously
or
unconsciously
how
they
might
use
him
and
assimilate
him
to
their
system
the
most
unpremeditated
subtle
successful
and
aimless
plutocracy
that
ever
encumbered
the
destinies
of
mankind
not
one
of
them
so
far
as
i
could
see
until
disaster
overtook
him
resented
his
lies
his
almost
naked
dishonesty
of
method
the
disorderly
disturbance
of
this
trade
and
that
caused
by
his
spasmodic
operations
i
can
see
them
now
about
him
see
them
polite
watchful
various
his
stiff
compact
little
figure
always
a
centre
of
attention
his
wiry
hair
his
brief
nose
his
electric
with
wandering
marginally
through
distinguished
gatherings
i
would
catch
the
whispers
that
s
ponderevo
the
little
man
yes
the
little
bounder
with
the
they
say
he
s
made
or
i
would
see
him
on
some
parterre
of
a
platform
beside
my
aunt
s
hurraying
hat
amidst
titles
and
costumes
holding
his
end
up
as
he
would
say
subscribing
heavily
to
obvious
charities
even
at
times
making
brief
convulsive
speeches
in
some
good
cause
before
the
most
exalted
audiences
mr
chairman
your
royal
highness
my
lords
ladies
and
gentlemen
b
he
would
begin
amidst
subsiding
applause
and
adjust
those
obstinate
glasses
and
thrust
back
the
wings
of
his
and
rest
his
hands
upon
his
hips
and
speak
his
fragment
with
ever
and
again
an
incidental
zzzz
his
hands
would
fret
about
him
as
he
spoke
fiddle
his
glasses
feel
in
his
waistcoat
pockets
ever
and
again
he
would
rise
slowly
to
his
toes
as
a
sentence
unwound
jerkily
like
a
clockwork
snake
and
drop
back
on
his
heels
at
the
end
they
were
the
very
gestures
of
our
first
encounter
when
he
had
stood
before
the
empty
fireplace
in
his
minute
draped
parlour
and
talked
of
my
future
to
my
mother
in
those
measurelessly
long
hot
afternoons
in
the
little
shop
at
wimblehurst
he
had
talked
and
dreamt
of
the
romance
of
modern
commerce
here
surely
was
his
romance
come
true
viii
people
say
that
my
uncle
lost
his
head
at
the
crest
of
his
fortunes
but
if
one
may
tell
so
much
truth
of
a
man
one
has
in
a
manner
loved
he
never
had
very
much
head
to
lose
he
was
always
imaginative
erratic
inconsistent
recklessly
inexact
and
his
inundation
of
wealth
merely
gave
him
scope
for
these
qualities
it
is
true
indeed
that
towards
the
climax
he
became
intensely
irritable
at
times
and
impatient
of
contradiction
but
that
i
think
was
rather
the
gnawing
uneasiness
of
sanity
than
any
mental
disturbance
but
i
find
it
hard
either
to
judge
him
or
convey
the
full
development
of
him
to
the
reader
i
saw
too
much
of
him
my
memory
is
choked
with
disarranged
moods
and
aspects
now
he
is
distended
with
megalomania
now
he
is
deflated
now
he
is
quarrelsome
now
impenetrably
but
always
he
is
sudden
jerky
fragmentary
energetic
and
in
some
subtle
fundamental
way
that
i
find
difficult
to
define
absurd
there
stands
out
because
of
the
tranquil
beauty
of
its
setting
perhaps
a
talk
we
had
in
the
veranda
of
the
little
pavilion
near
my
worksheds
behind
crest
hill
in
which
my
aeroplanes
and
navigable
balloons
were
housed
it
was
one
of
many
similar
conversations
and
i
do
not
know
why
it
in
particular
should
survive
its
fellows
it
happens
so
he
had
come
up
to
me
after
his
coffee
to
consult
me
about
a
certain
chalice
which
in
a
moment
of
splendour
and
under
the
importunity
of
a
countess
he
had
determined
to
give
to
a
deserving
church
in
the
i
in
a
moment
of
even
rasher
generosity
had
suggested
ewart
as
a
possible
artist
ewart
had
produced
at
once
an
admirable
sketch
for
the
sacred
vessel
surrounded
by
a
sort
of
wreath
of
millies
with
open
arms
and
wings
and
had
drawn
fifty
pounds
on
the
strength
of
it
after
that
came
a
series
of
vexatious
delays
the
chalice
became
less
and
less
of
a
commercial
man
s
chalice
acquired
more
and
more
the
elusive
quality
of
the
holy
grail
and
at
last
even
the
drawing
receded
my
uncle
grew
restive
you
see
george
they
ll
begin
to
want
the
blasted
thing
what
blasted
thing
that
chalice
damn
it
they
re
beginning
to
ask
questions
it
isn
t
business
it
s
art
i
protested
and
that
s
all
very
well
but
it
s
not
a
good
ad
for
us
george
to
make
a
promise
and
not
deliver
the
goods
i
ll
have
to
write
off
your
friend
ewart
as
a
bad
debt
that
s
what
it
comes
to
and
go
to
a
decent
we
sat
outside
on
deck
chairs
in
the
veranda
of
the
pavilion
smoked
drank
whisky
and
the
chalice
disposed
of
meditated
his
temporary
annoyance
passed
it
was
an
altogether
splendid
summer
night
following
a
blazing
indolent
day
full
moonlight
brought
out
dimly
the
lines
of
the
receding
hills
one
wave
beyond
another
far
beyond
were
the
lights
of
leatherhead
and
in
the
foreground
the
little
stage
from
which
i
used
to
start
upon
my
gliders
gleamed
like
wet
steel
the
season
must
have
been
high
june
for
down
in
the
woods
that
hid
the
lights
of
the
lady
grove
windows
i
remember
the
nightingales
thrilled
and
gurgled
we
got
here
george
said
my
uncle
ending
a
long
pause
didn
t
i
say
say
when
i
asked
in
that
hole
in
the
to
nem
court
road
eh
it
s
been
a
straight
square
fight
and
here
we
are
i
nodded
member
me
telling
you
well
i
d
just
that
afternoon
thought
of
it
i
ve
fancied
at
times
i
admitted
it
s
a
great
world
george
nowadays
with
a
fair
chance
for
every
one
who
lays
hold
of
things
the
career
ouvert
to
the
talons
eh
think
of
it
it
s
a
great
world
and
a
growing
world
and
i
m
glad
we
re
in
it
and
getting
a
pull
we
re
getting
big
people
george
things
come
to
us
eh
this
palestine
he
meditated
for
a
time
and
zzzzed
softly
then
he
became
still
his
theme
was
taken
up
by
a
cricket
in
the
grass
until
he
himself
was
ready
to
resume
it
the
cricket
too
seemed
to
fancy
that
in
some
scheme
of
its
own
it
had
got
there
chirrrrrrup
it
said
lord
what
a
place
that
was
at
wimblehurst
he
broke
out
if
ever
i
get
a
day
off
we
ll
motor
there
george
and
run
over
that
dog
that
sleeps
in
the
high
street
always
was
a
dog
asleep
there
always
always
i
d
like
to
see
the
old
shop
again
i
daresay
old
ruck
still
stands
between
the
sheep
at
his
door
grinning
with
all
his
teeth
and
marbel
silly
beggar
comes
out
with
his
white
apron
on
and
a
pencil
stuck
behind
his
ear
trying
to
look
awake
wonder
if
they
know
it
s
me
i
d
like
em
somehow
to
know
it
s
they
ll
have
had
the
international
tea
company
and
all
sorts
of
people
cutting
them
up
i
said
and
that
dog
s
been
on
the
pavement
this
six
years
can
t
sleep
even
there
poor
dear
because
of
the
and
its
shattered
movin
everywhere
said
my
uncle
i
expect
you
re
right
it
s
a
big
time
we
re
in
george
it
s
a
big
progressive
imperial
time
this
palestine
business
the
daring
of
it
it
s
it
s
a
process
george
and
we
got
our
hands
on
it
here
we
sit
with
our
hands
on
it
george
entrusted
it
seems
quiet
to
night
but
if
we
could
see
and
he
waved
his
cigar
towards
leatherhead
and
london
there
they
are
millions
george
jes
think
of
what
they
ve
been
up
to
those
ten
millions
each
one
doing
his
own
particular
job
you
can
t
grasp
it
it
s
like
old
whitman
says
what
is
it
he
says
well
anyway
it
s
like
old
whitman
fine
chap
whitman
fine
old
chap
queer
you
can
t
quote
him
and
these
millions
aren
t
anything
there
s
the
millions
over
seas
hundreds
of
millions
chinese
m
rocco
africa
generally
merica
well
here
we
are
with
power
with
leisure
picked
out
because
we
ve
been
energetic
because
we
ve
seized
opportunities
because
we
ve
made
things
hum
when
other
people
have
waited
for
them
to
hum
see
here
we
are
with
our
hands
on
it
big
people
big
growing
people
in
a
sort
of
way
he
paused
it
s
wonderful
george
he
said
energy
i
said
softly
to
the
night
that
s
it
george
energy
it
s
put
things
in
our
grip
threads
wires
stretching
out
and
out
george
from
that
little
office
of
ours
out
to
west
africa
out
to
egypt
out
to
inja
out
east
west
north
and
south
running
the
world
practically
running
it
faster
and
faster
creative
there
s
that
palestine
canal
affair
marvellous
idee
suppose
we
take
that
up
suppose
we
let
ourselves
in
for
it
us
and
the
others
and
run
that
water
sluice
from
the
mediterranean
into
the
dead
sea
valley
think
of
the
difference
it
will
make
all
the
desert
blooming
like
a
rose
jericho
lost
for
ever
all
the
holy
places
under
water
very
likely
destroy
he
mused
for
a
space
cuttin
canals
murmured
my
uncle
making
tunnels
new
countries
new
centres
zzzz
finance
not
only
palestine
i
wonder
where
we
shall
get
before
we
done
george
we
got
a
lot
of
big
things
going
we
got
the
investing
public
sound
and
sure
i
don
t
see
why
in
the
end
we
shouldn
t
be
very
big
there
s
difficulties
but
i
m
equal
to
them
we
re
still
a
bit
soft
in
our
bones
but
they
ll
harden
all
right
i
suppose
after
all
i
m
worth
something
like
a
million
george
cleared
up
and
settled
if
i
got
out
of
things
now
it
s
a
great
time
george
a
wonderful
time
i
glanced
through
the
twilight
at
his
convexity
and
i
must
confess
it
struck
me
that
on
the
whole
he
wasn
t
particularly
good
value
we
got
our
hands
on
things
george
us
big
people
we
got
to
hang
together
george
run
the
show
join
up
with
the
old
order
like
that
of
kipling
s
finest
thing
he
ever
wrote
george
i
jes
been
reading
it
again
made
me
buy
lady
grove
well
we
got
to
run
the
country
george
it
s
ours
make
it
a
scientific
organised
business
enterprise
put
idees
into
it
lectrify
it
run
the
press
run
all
sorts
of
developments
all
sorts
of
developments
i
been
talking
to
lord
boom
i
been
talking
to
all
sorts
of
people
great
things
progress
the
world
on
business
lines
only
jes
he
fell
into
a
deep
meditation
he
zzzzed
for
a
time
and
ceased
yes
he
said
at
last
in
the
tone
of
a
man
who
has
at
last
emerged
with
ultimate
solutions
to
the
profoundest
problems
what
i
said
after
a
seemly
pause
my
uncle
hung
fire
for
a
moment
and
it
seemed
to
me
the
fate
of
nations
trembled
in
the
balance
then
he
spoke
as
one
who
speaks
from
the
very
bottom
of
his
heart
and
i
think
it
was
the
very
bottom
of
his
heart
i
d
jes
like
to
drop
into
the
eastry
arms
jes
when
all
those
beggars
in
the
parlour
are
sittin
down
to
whist
ruck
and
marbel
and
all
and
give
em
ten
minutes
of
my
mind
george
straight
from
the
shoulder
jes
exactly
what
i
think
of
them
it
s
a
little
thing
but
i
d
like
to
do
it
jes
once
before
i
he
rested
on
that
for
some
time
then
he
broke
out
at
a
new
place
in
a
tone
of
detached
criticism
there
s
boom
he
reflected
it
s
a
wonderful
system
this
old
british
system
george
it
s
staid
and
stable
and
yet
it
has
a
place
for
new
men
we
come
up
and
take
our
places
it
s
almost
expected
we
take
a
hand
that
s
where
our
democracy
differs
from
america
over
there
a
man
succeeds
all
he
gets
is
money
here
there
s
a
system
open
to
every
one
practically
chaps
like
boom
come
from
his
voice
ceased
i
reflected
upon
the
spirit
of
his
words
suddenly
i
kicked
my
feet
in
the
air
rolled
on
my
side
and
sat
up
suddenly
on
my
deck
chair
with
my
legs
down
you
don
t
mean
it
i
said
mean
what
george
subscription
to
the
party
funds
reciprocal
advantage
have
we
got
to
that
whad
you
driving
at
george
you
know
they
d
never
do
it
man
do
what
he
said
feebly
and
why
shouldn
t
they
they
d
not
even
go
to
a
baronetcy
no
and
yet
of
course
there
s
boom
and
collingshead
and
gorver
they
ve
done
beer
they
ve
done
snippets
after
all
it
s
not
like
a
turf
commission
agent
or
anything
like
that
there
have
of
course
been
some
very
gentlemanly
commission
agents
it
isn
t
like
a
fool
of
a
scientific
man
who
can
t
make
money
my
uncle
grunted
we
d
differed
on
that
issue
before
a
malignant
humour
took
possession
of
me
what
would
they
call
you
i
speculated
the
vicar
would
like
duffield
too
much
like
duffer
difficult
thing
a
i
ran
my
mind
over
various
possibilities
why
not
take
a
leaf
from
a
socialist
tract
i
came
upon
yesterday
chap
says
we
re
all
getting
delocalised
beautiful
word
delocalised
why
not
be
the
first
delocalised
peer
that
gives
you
there
is
a
bungay
you
know
lord
tono
of
bungay
in
bottles
everywhere
eh
my
uncle
astonished
me
by
losing
his
temper
damn
it
george
you
don
t
seem
to
see
i
m
serious
you
re
always
sneering
at
as
though
it
was
some
sort
of
swindle
it
was
perfec
ly
legitimate
trade
perfec
ly
legitimate
good
value
and
a
good
article
when
i
come
up
here
and
tell
you
plans
and
exchange
idees
you
sneer
at
me
you
do
you
don
t
see
it
s
a
big
thing
it
s
a
big
thing
you
got
to
get
used
to
new
circumstances
you
got
to
face
what
lies
before
us
you
got
to
drop
that
ix
my
uncle
was
not
altogether
swallowed
up
in
business
and
ambition
he
kept
in
touch
with
modern
thought
for
example
he
was
i
know
greatly
swayed
by
what
he
called
this
overman
idee
nietzsche
all
that
he
mingled
those
comforting
suggestions
of
a
potent
and
exceptional
human
being
emancipated
from
the
pettier
limitations
of
integrity
with
the
napoleonic
legend
it
gave
his
imagination
a
considerable
outlet
that
napoleonic
legend
the
real
mischief
of
napoleon
s
immensely
disastrous
and
accidental
career
began
only
when
he
was
dead
and
the
romantic
type
of
mind
was
free
to
elaborate
his
character
i
do
believe
that
my
uncle
would
have
made
a
far
less
egregious
smash
if
there
had
been
no
napoleonic
legend
to
misguide
him
he
was
in
many
ways
better
and
infinitely
kinder
than
his
career
but
when
in
doubt
between
decent
conduct
and
a
base
advantage
that
cult
came
in
more
and
more
influentially
think
of
napoleon
think
what
the
napoleon
would
have
done
with
such
scruples
as
yours
that
was
the
rule
and
the
end
was
invariably
a
new
step
in
dishonour
my
uncle
was
in
an
unsystematic
way
a
collector
of
napoleonic
relics
the
bigger
the
book
about
his
hero
the
more
readily
he
bought
it
he
purchased
letters
and
tinsel
and
weapons
that
bore
however
remotely
upon
the
man
of
destiny
and
he
even
secured
in
geneva
though
he
never
brought
home
an
old
coach
in
which
buonaparte
might
have
ridden
he
crowded
the
quiet
walls
of
lady
grove
with
engravings
and
figures
of
him
preferring
my
aunt
remarked
the
more
convex
portraits
with
the
white
vest
and
those
statuettes
with
the
hands
behind
the
back
which
threw
forward
the
figure
the
durgans
watched
him
through
it
all
sardonically
and
he
would
stand
after
breakfast
at
times
in
the
light
of
the
window
at
lady
grove
a
little
apart
with
two
fingers
of
one
hand
stuck
between
his
and
his
chin
sunken
thinking
the
most
preposterous
little
fat
man
in
the
world
it
made
my
aunt
feel
she
said
like
an
old
field
marshal
knocks
me
into
a
cocked
hat
george
perhaps
this
napoleonic
bias
made
him
a
little
less
frequent
with
his
cigars
than
he
would
otherwise
have
been
but
of
that
i
can
not
be
sure
and
it
certainly
caused
my
aunt
a
considerable
amount
of
vexation
after
he
had
read
napoleon
and
the
fair
sex
because
for
a
time
that
roused
him
to
a
sense
of
a
side
of
life
he
had
in
his
commercial
preoccupations
very
largely
forgotten
suggestion
plays
so
great
a
part
in
this
field
my
uncle
took
the
next
opportunity
and
had
an
affair
it
was
not
a
very
impassioned
affair
and
the
exact
particulars
never
of
course
reached
me
it
is
quite
by
chance
i
know
anything
of
it
at
all
one
evening
i
was
surprised
to
come
upon
my
uncle
in
a
mixture
of
bohemia
and
smart
people
at
an
at
home
in
the
flat
of
robbert
the
who
painted
my
aunt
and
he
was
standing
a
little
apart
in
a
recess
talking
or
rather
being
talked
to
in
undertones
by
a
plump
blond
little
woman
in
pale
blue
a
helen
scrymgeour
who
wrote
novels
and
was
organising
a
weekly
magazine
i
elbowed
a
large
lady
who
was
saying
something
about
them
but
i
didn
t
need
to
hear
the
thing
she
said
to
perceive
the
relationship
of
the
two
it
hit
me
like
a
placard
on
a
hoarding
i
was
amazed
the
whole
gathering
did
not
see
it
perhaps
they
did
she
was
wearing
a
remarkably
fine
diamond
necklace
much
too
fine
for
journalism
and
regarding
him
with
that
quality
of
questionable
proprietorship
of
leashed
but
straining
intimacy
that
seems
inseparable
from
this
sort
of
affair
it
is
so
much
more
palpable
than
matrimony
if
anything
was
wanted
to
complete
my
conviction
it
was
my
uncles
s
eyes
when
presently
he
became
aware
of
mine
a
certain
embarrassment
and
a
certain
pride
and
defiance
and
the
next
day
he
made
an
opportunity
to
praise
the
lady
s
intelligence
to
me
concisely
lest
i
should
miss
the
point
of
it
all
after
that
i
heard
some
gossip
from
a
friend
of
the
lady
s
i
was
much
too
curious
to
do
anything
but
listen
i
had
never
in
all
my
life
imagined
my
uncle
in
an
amorous
attitude
it
would
appear
that
she
called
him
her
god
in
the
car
after
the
hero
in
a
novel
of
anthony
hope
s
it
was
essential
to
the
convention
of
their
relations
that
he
should
go
relentlessly
whenever
business
called
and
it
was
generally
arranged
that
it
did
call
to
him
women
were
an
incident
it
was
understood
between
them
ambition
was
the
a
great
world
called
him
and
the
noble
hunger
for
power
i
have
never
been
able
to
discover
just
how
honest
scrymgeour
was
in
all
this
but
it
is
quite
possible
the
immense
glamour
of
his
financial
largeness
prevailed
with
her
and
that
she
did
bring
a
really
romantic
feeling
to
their
encounters
there
must
have
been
some
extraordinary
moments
i
was
a
good
deal
exercised
and
distressed
about
my
aunt
when
i
realised
what
was
afoot
i
thought
it
would
prove
a
terrible
humiliation
to
her
i
suspected
her
of
keeping
up
a
brave
front
with
the
loss
of
my
uncle
s
affections
fretting
at
her
heart
but
there
i
simply
underestimated
her
she
didn
t
hear
for
some
time
and
when
she
did
hear
she
was
extremely
angry
and
energetic
the
sentimental
situation
didn
t
trouble
her
for
a
moment
she
decided
that
my
uncle
wanted
she
accentuated
herself
with
an
unexpected
new
hat
went
and
gave
him
an
inconceivable
at
the
hardingham
and
then
came
round
to
me
for
not
telling
her
what
was
going
on
before
i
tried
to
bring
her
to
a
proper
sense
of
the
accepted
values
in
this
affair
but
my
aunt
s
originality
of
outlook
was
never
so
invincible
men
don
t
tell
on
one
another
in
affairs
of
passion
i
protested
and
worldly
excuses
women
she
said
in
high
indignation
and
men
it
isn
t
women
and
men
it
s
him
and
me
george
why
don
t
you
talk
sense
old
passion
s
all
very
well
george
in
its
way
and
i
m
the
last
person
to
be
jealous
but
this
is
old
nonsense
i
m
not
going
to
let
him
show
off
what
a
silly
old
lobster
he
is
to
other
women
i
ll
mark
every
scrap
of
his
underclothes
with
red
letters
every
scrap
going
about
making
love
indeed
in
abdominal
belts
at
his
time
of
life
i
can
not
imagine
what
passed
between
her
and
my
uncle
but
i
have
no
doubt
that
for
once
her
customary
badinage
was
laid
aside
how
they
talked
then
i
do
not
know
for
i
who
knew
them
so
well
had
never
heard
that
much
of
intimacy
between
them
at
any
rate
it
was
a
concerned
and
preoccupied
god
in
the
car
i
had
to
deal
with
in
the
next
few
days
unusually
and
given
to
slight
impatient
gestures
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
current
conversation
and
it
was
evident
that
in
all
directions
he
was
finding
things
unusually
difficult
to
explain
all
the
intimate
moments
in
this
affair
were
hidden
from
me
but
in
the
end
my
aunt
triumphed
he
did
not
so
much
throw
as
jerk
over
scrymgeour
and
she
did
not
so
much
make
a
novel
of
it
as
upset
a
huge
pailful
of
attenuated
and
adulterated
female
soul
upon
this
occasion
my
aunt
did
not
appear
in
that
even
remotely
so
that
it
is
doubtful
if
the
lady
knew
the
real
causes
of
her
abandonment
the
napoleonic
hero
was
practically
unmarried
and
he
threw
over
his
lady
as
napoleon
threw
over
josephine
for
a
great
alliance
it
was
a
triumph
for
my
aunt
but
it
had
its
price
for
some
time
it
was
evident
things
were
strained
between
them
he
gave
up
the
lady
but
he
resented
having
to
do
so
deeply
she
had
meant
more
to
his
imagination
than
one
could
have
supposed
he
wouldn
t
for
a
long
time
come
he
became
touchy
and
impatient
and
secretive
towards
my
aunt
and
she
i
noted
after
an
amazing
check
or
so
stopped
that
stream
of
kindly
abuse
that
had
flowed
for
so
long
and
had
been
so
great
a
refreshment
in
their
lives
they
were
both
the
poorer
for
its
cessation
both
less
happy
she
devoted
herself
more
and
more
to
lady
grove
and
the
humours
and
complications
of
its
management
the
servants
took
to
her
as
they
say
she
three
susans
during
her
rule
the
coachman
s
the
gardener
s
and
the
up
hill
gamekeeper
s
she
got
together
a
library
of
old
household
books
that
were
in
the
vein
of
the
place
she
revived
the
and
became
a
great
artist
in
jellies
and
elder
and
cowslip
wine
x
and
while
i
neglected
the
development
of
my
uncle
s
finances
and
my
own
in
my
scientific
work
and
my
absorbing
conflict
with
the
difficulties
of
flying
his
schemes
grew
more
and
more
expansive
and
hazardous
and
his
spending
wilder
and
laxer
i
believe
that
a
haunting
sense
of
the
intensifying
unsoundness
of
his
position
accounts
largely
for
his
increasing
irritability
and
his
increasing
secretiveness
with
my
aunt
and
myself
during
these
crowning
years
he
dreaded
i
think
having
to
explain
he
feared
our
jests
might
pierce
unwittingly
to
the
truth
even
in
the
privacy
of
his
mind
he
would
not
face
the
truth
he
was
accumulating
unrealisable
securities
in
his
safes
until
they
hung
a
potential
avalanche
over
the
economic
world
but
his
buying
became
a
fever
and
his
restless
desire
to
keep
it
up
with
himself
that
he
was
making
a
triumphant
progress
to
limitless
wealth
gnawed
deeper
and
deeper
a
curious
feature
of
this
time
with
him
was
his
buying
over
and
over
again
of
similar
things
his
ideas
seemed
to
run
in
series
within
a
he
bought
five
new
each
more
swift
and
powerful
than
its
predecessor
and
only
the
repeated
prompt
resignation
of
his
chief
chauffeur
at
each
moment
of
danger
prevented
his
driving
them
himself
he
used
them
more
and
more
he
developed
a
passion
for
locomotion
for
its
own
sake
then
he
began
to
chafe
at
lady
grove
fretted
by
a
chance
jest
he
had
overheard
at
a
dinner
this
house
george
he
said
it
s
a
misfit
there
s
no
in
it
it
s
choked
with
old
memories
and
i
can
t
stand
all
these
damned
durgans
that
chap
in
the
corner
george
no
the
other
corner
the
man
in
a
coat
he
watched
you
he
d
look
silly
if
i
stuck
a
poker
through
his
gizzard
he
d
look
i
reflected
much
as
he
does
now
as
though
he
was
he
replaced
his
glasses
which
had
fallen
at
his
emotion
and
glared
at
his
antagonists
what
are
they
what
are
they
all
the
lot
of
em
dead
as
mutton
they
just
stuck
in
the
mud
they
didn
t
even
rise
to
the
reformation
the
old
reformation
move
with
the
times
they
moved
against
the
times
just
a
family
of
failure
they
never
even
tried
they
re
jes
george
exactly
what
i
m
not
exactly
it
isn
t
suitable
all
this
living
in
the
past
and
i
want
a
bigger
place
too
george
i
want
air
and
sunlight
and
room
to
move
about
and
more
service
a
house
where
you
can
get
a
move
on
things
zzzz
why
it
s
like
a
discord
it
jars
even
to
have
the
telephone
there
s
nothing
nothing
except
the
terrace
that
s
worth
a
rap
it
s
all
dark
and
old
and
dried
up
and
full
of
things
musty
old
idees
fitter
for
a
than
a
modern
man
i
don
t
know
how
i
got
he
broke
out
into
a
new
grievance
that
damned
vicar
he
complained
thinks
i
ought
to
think
myself
lucky
to
get
this
place
every
time
i
meet
him
i
can
see
him
think
it
one
of
these
days
george
i
ll
show
him
what
a
mod
un
house
is
like
and
he
did
i
remember
the
day
when
he
declared
as
americans
say
for
crest
hill
he
had
come
up
to
see
my
new
gas
plant
for
i
was
then
only
just
beginning
to
experiment
with
auxiliary
collapsible
balloons
and
all
the
time
the
shine
of
his
glasses
was
wandering
away
to
the
open
down
beyond
let
s
go
back
to
lady
grove
over
the
hill
he
said
something
i
want
to
show
you
something
fine
it
was
an
empty
sunlit
place
that
summer
evening
sky
and
earth
warm
with
sundown
and
a
or
so
just
accentuating
the
pleasant
stillness
that
ends
a
long
clear
day
a
beautiful
peace
it
was
to
wreck
for
ever
and
there
was
my
uncle
the
modern
man
of
power
in
his
grey
and
his
grey
suit
and
his
glasses
short
pointing
and
gesticulating
threatening
this
calm
he
began
with
a
wave
of
his
arm
that
s
the
place
george
he
said
see
eh
i
cried
for
i
had
been
thinking
of
remote
things
i
got
got
what
for
a
house
a
twentieth
century
house
that
s
the
place
for
it
one
of
his
characteristic
phrases
was
begotten
in
him
to
the
winds
of
heaven
george
he
said
eh
to
the
winds
of
heaven
you
ll
get
the
winds
up
here
i
said
a
mammoth
house
it
ought
to
be
george
to
suit
these
quite
i
said
great
galleries
and
things
running
out
there
and
there
see
i
been
thinking
of
it
george
looking
out
all
this
way
across
the
weald
with
its
back
to
lady
and
the
morning
sun
in
its
like
an
eagle
george
like
an
eagle
so
he
broached
to
me
what
speedily
became
the
leading
occupation
of
his
culminating
years
crest
hill
but
all
the
world
has
heard
of
that
extravagant
place
which
grew
and
changed
its
plans
as
it
grew
and
bubbled
like
a
salted
snail
and
burgeoned
and
bulged
and
evermore
grew
i
know
not
what
delirium
of
pinnacles
and
terraces
and
arcades
and
corridors
glittered
at
last
upon
the
uplands
of
his
mind
the
place
for
all
that
its
expansion
was
terminated
abruptly
by
our
collapse
is
wonderful
enough
as
it
stands
that
empty
instinctive
building
of
a
childless
man
his
chief
architect
was
a
young
man
named
westminster
whose
work
he
had
picked
out
in
the
architecture
room
of
the
royal
academy
on
account
of
a
certain
grandiose
courage
in
it
but
with
him
he
associated
from
time
to
time
a
number
of
fellow
professionals
stonemasons
sanitary
engineers
painters
sculptors
scribes
metal
workers
wood
carvers
furniture
designers
ceramic
specialists
landscape
gardeners
and
the
man
who
designs
the
arrangement
and
ventilation
of
the
various
new
houses
in
the
london
zoological
gardens
in
addition
he
had
his
own
ideas
the
thing
occupied
his
mind
at
all
times
but
it
held
it
completely
from
friday
night
to
monday
morning
he
would
come
down
to
lady
grove
on
friday
night
in
a
crowded
that
almost
dripped
architects
he
didn
t
however
confine
himself
to
architects
every
one
was
liable
to
an
invitation
to
and
view
crest
hill
and
many
an
eager
promoter
unaware
of
how
napoleonically
and
completely
my
uncle
had
departmentalised
his
mind
tried
to
creep
up
to
him
by
way
of
tiles
and
ventilators
and
new
electric
fittings
always
on
sunday
mornings
unless
the
weather
was
vile
he
would
so
soon
as
breakfast
and
his
secretaries
were
disposed
of
visit
the
site
with
a
considerable
retinue
and
alter
and
develop
plans
making
modifications
giving
immense
new
orders
verbally
an
unsatisfactory
way
as
westminster
and
the
contractors
ultimately
found
there
he
stands
in
my
memory
the
symbol
of
this
age
for
me
the
man
of
luck
and
advertisement
the
current
master
of
the
world
there
he
stands
upon
the
great
outward
sweep
of
the
terrace
before
the
huge
main
entrance
a
little
figure
ridiculously
disproportionate
to
that
arch
with
the
granite
ball
behind
him
the
astronomical
ball
brass
coopered
that
represented
the
world
with
a
little
adjustable
tube
of
lenses
on
a
arm
that
focussed
the
sun
upon
just
that
point
of
the
earth
on
which
it
chanced
to
be
shining
vertically
there
he
stands
napoleonically
grouped
with
his
retinue
men
in
tweeds
and
a
little
solicitor
whose
name
i
forget
in
grey
trousers
and
a
black
jacket
and
westminster
in
jaeger
underclothing
a
floriferous
tie
and
peculiar
brown
cloth
of
his
own
the
downland
breeze
flutters
my
uncle
s
disarranges
his
stiff
hair
and
insists
on
the
evidence
of
undisciplined
appetites
in
face
and
form
as
he
points
out
this
or
that
feature
in
the
prospect
to
his
attentive
collaborator
below
are
hundreds
of
feet
of
ditches
excavations
heaps
of
earth
piles
of
garden
stone
from
the
wealden
ridges
on
either
hand
the
walls
of
his
irrelevant
unmeaning
palace
rise
at
one
time
he
had
working
in
that
place
disturbing
the
economic
balance
of
the
whole
countryside
by
their
presence
upwards
of
three
thousand
men
so
he
poses
for
my
picture
amidst
the
raw
beginnings
that
were
never
to
be
completed
he
did
the
strangest
things
about
that
place
things
more
and
more
detached
from
any
conception
of
financial
scale
things
more
and
more
apart
from
sober
humanity
he
seemed
to
think
himself
at
last
released
from
any
such
limitations
he
moved
a
quite
considerable
hill
and
nearly
sixty
mature
trees
were
moved
with
it
to
open
his
prospect
eastward
moved
it
about
two
hundred
feet
to
the
south
at
another
time
he
caught
a
suggestion
from
some
city
restaurant
and
made
a
roofed
with
plate
glass
beneath
the
waters
of
his
ornamental
lake
he
furnished
one
wing
while
its
roof
still
awaited
completion
he
had
a
swimming
bath
thirty
feet
square
next
to
his
bedroom
upstairs
and
to
crown
it
all
he
commenced
a
great
wall
to
hold
all
his
dominions
together
free
from
the
invasion
of
common
men
it
was
a
wall
glass
surmounted
and
had
it
been
completed
as
he
intended
it
it
would
have
had
a
total
length
of
nearly
eleven
miles
some
of
it
towards
the
last
was
so
dishonestly
built
that
it
collapsed
within
a
year
upon
its
foundations
but
some
miles
of
it
still
stand
i
never
think
of
it
now
but
what
i
think
of
the
hundreds
of
eager
little
investors
who
followed
his
star
whose
hopes
and
lives
whose
wives
security
and
children
s
prospects
are
all
mixed
up
beyond
redemption
with
that
flaking
mortar
it
is
curious
how
many
of
these
modern
financiers
of
chance
and
bluff
have
ended
their
careers
by
building
it
was
not
merely
my
uncle
sooner
or
later
they
all
seem
to
bring
their
luck
to
the
test
of
realisation
try
to
make
their
fluid
opulence
coagulate
out
as
bricks
and
mortar
bring
moonshine
into
relations
with
a
weekly
then
the
whole
fabric
of
confidence
and
imagination
totters
and
down
they
come
when
i
think
of
that
despoiled
hillside
that
colossal
litter
of
bricks
and
mortar
and
crude
roads
and
paths
the
scaffolding
and
sheds
the
general
quality
of
unforeseeing
outrage
upon
the
peace
of
nature
i
am
reminded
of
a
chat
i
had
with
the
vicar
one
bleak
day
after
he
had
witnessed
a
glide
he
talked
to
me
of
aeronautics
as
i
stood
in
jersey
and
shorts
beside
my
machine
fresh
from
alighting
and
his
cadaverous
face
failed
to
conceal
a
peculiar
desolation
that
possessed
him
almost
you
convince
me
he
said
coming
up
to
me
against
my
will
a
marvellous
invention
but
it
will
take
you
a
long
time
sir
before
you
can
emulate
that
perfect
mechanism
the
wing
of
a
he
looked
at
my
sheds
you
ve
changed
the
look
of
this
valley
too
he
said
temporary
defilements
i
remarked
guessing
what
was
in
his
mind
of
course
things
come
and
go
things
come
and
go
but
h
m
i
ve
just
been
up
over
the
hill
to
look
at
edward
ponderevo
s
new
house
that
that
is
something
more
permanent
a
magnificent
place
in
many
ways
imposing
i
ve
never
somehow
brought
myself
to
go
that
way
before
things
are
greatly
advanced
we
find
the
great
number
of
strangers
introduced
into
the
villages
about
here
by
these
operations
chiefly
a
little
embarrassing
it
put
us
out
they
bring
a
new
spirit
into
the
place
betting
ideas
all
sorts
of
queer
notions
our
publicans
like
it
of
course
and
they
come
and
sleep
in
one
s
outhouses
and
make
the
place
a
little
unsafe
at
nights
the
other
morning
i
couldn
t
sleep
a
slight
dyspepsia
and
i
looked
out
of
the
window
i
was
amazed
to
see
people
going
by
on
bicycles
a
silent
procession
i
counted
in
the
dawn
all
going
up
to
the
new
road
for
crest
hill
remarkable
i
thought
it
and
so
i
ve
been
up
to
see
what
they
were
they
would
have
been
more
than
remarkable
thirty
years
ago
i
said
yes
indeed
things
change
we
think
nothing
of
it
now
at
all
comparatively
and
that
big
house
he
raised
his
eyebrows
really
stupendous
stupendous
all
the
hillside
the
old
turf
cut
to
ribbons
his
eye
searched
my
face
we
ve
grown
so
accustomed
to
look
up
to
lady
grove
he
said
and
smiled
in
search
of
sympathy
it
shifts
our
centre
of
things
will
readjust
themselves
i
lied
he
snatched
at
the
phrase
of
course
he
said
they
ll
readjust
themselves
settle
down
again
must
in
the
old
way
it
s
bound
to
come
right
again
a
comforting
thought
yes
after
all
lady
grove
itself
had
to
be
built
once
upon
a
time
was
to
begin
with
his
eye
returned
to
my
aeroplane
he
sought
to
dismiss
his
graver
preoccupations
i
should
think
twice
he
remarked
before
i
trusted
myself
to
that
concern
but
i
suppose
one
grows
accustomed
to
the
he
bade
me
good
morning
and
went
his
way
bowed
and
thoughtful
he
had
kept
the
truth
from
his
mind
a
long
time
but
that
morning
it
had
forced
its
way
to
him
with
an
aspect
that
brooked
no
denial
that
this
time
it
was
not
just
changes
that
were
coming
in
his
world
but
that
all
his
world
lay
open
and
defenceless
conquered
and
surrendered
doomed
so
far
as
he
could
see
root
and
branch
scale
and
form
alike
to
change
chapter
the
third
soaring
i
for
nearly
all
the
time
that
my
uncle
was
incubating
and
hatching
crest
hill
i
was
busy
in
a
little
transverse
valley
between
that
great
beginning
and
lady
grove
with
more
and
more
costly
and
ambitious
experiments
in
aerial
navigation
this
work
was
indeed
the
main
substance
of
my
life
through
all
the
great
time
of
the
symphony
i
have
told
already
how
i
came
to
devote
myself
to
this
system
of
inquiries
how
in
a
sort
of
disgust
with
the
common
adventure
of
life
i
took
up
the
dropped
ends
of
my
college
studies
taking
them
up
again
with
a
man
s
resolution
instead
of
a
boy
s
ambition
from
the
first
i
did
well
at
this
work
it
was
i
think
largely
a
case
of
special
aptitude
of
a
peculiar
irrelevant
vein
of
faculty
running
through
my
mind
it
is
one
of
those
things
men
seem
to
have
by
chance
that
has
little
or
nothing
to
do
with
their
general
merit
and
which
it
is
ridiculous
to
be
either
conceited
or
modest
about
i
did
get
through
a
very
big
mass
of
work
in
those
years
working
for
a
time
with
a
concentrated
fierceness
that
left
little
of
such
energy
or
capacity
as
i
possess
unused
i
worked
out
a
series
of
problems
connected
with
the
stability
of
bodies
pitching
in
the
air
and
the
internal
movements
of
the
wind
and
i
also
revolutionised
one
leading
part
at
last
of
the
theory
of
explosive
engines
these
things
are
to
be
found
in
the
philosophical
transactions
the
mathematical
journal
and
less
frequently
in
one
or
two
other
such
publications
and
they
needn
t
detain
us
here
indeed
i
doubt
if
i
could
write
about
them
here
one
acquires
a
sort
of
shorthand
for
one
s
notes
and
mind
in
relation
to
such
special
work
i
have
never
taught
nor
lectured
that
is
to
say
i
have
never
had
to
express
my
thoughts
about
mechanical
things
in
ordinary
everyday
language
and
i
doubt
very
much
if
i
could
do
so
now
without
extreme
tedium
my
work
was
to
begin
with
very
largely
theoretical
i
was
able
to
attack
such
early
necessities
of
verification
as
arose
with
quite
little
models
using
a
turntable
to
get
the
motion
through
the
air
and
cane
whalebone
and
silk
as
building
material
but
a
time
came
when
incalculable
factors
crept
in
factors
of
human
capacity
and
factors
of
insufficient
experimental
knowledge
when
one
must
needs
guess
and
try
then
i
had
to
enlarge
the
scale
of
my
operations
and
soon
i
had
enlarged
them
very
greatly
i
set
to
work
almost
concurrently
on
the
balance
and
stability
of
gliders
and
upon
the
steering
of
inflated
bags
the
latter
a
particularly
expensive
branch
of
work
i
was
no
doubt
moved
by
something
of
the
same
spirit
of
lavish
expenditure
that
was
running
away
with
my
uncle
in
these
developments
presently
my
establishment
above
lady
grove
had
grown
to
a
painted
wood
chalet
big
enough
to
accommodate
six
men
and
in
which
i
would
sometimes
live
for
three
weeks
together
to
a
gasometer
to
a
to
three
big
sheds
and
houses
to
a
stage
from
which
to
start
gliders
to
a
workshop
and
so
forth
a
rough
road
was
made
we
brought
up
gas
from
cheaping
and
electricity
from
woking
which
place
i
found
also
afforded
a
friendly
workshop
for
larger
operations
than
i
could
manage
i
had
the
luck
also
to
find
a
man
who
seemed
my
cothope
his
name
was
he
was
a
he
had
formerly
been
a
sapper
and
he
was
one
of
the
best
and
handiest
working
engineers
alive
without
him
i
do
not
think
i
could
have
achieved
half
what
i
have
done
at
times
he
has
been
not
so
much
my
assistant
as
my
collaborator
and
has
followed
my
fortunes
to
this
day
other
men
came
and
went
as
i
needed
them
i
do
not
know
how
far
it
is
possible
to
convey
to
any
one
who
has
not
experienced
it
the
peculiar
interest
the
peculiar
satisfaction
that
lies
in
a
sustained
research
when
one
is
not
hampered
by
want
of
money
it
is
a
different
thing
from
any
other
sort
of
human
effort
you
are
free
from
the
exasperating
conflict
with
your
altogether
at
least
so
far
as
the
essential
work
goes
that
for
me
is
its
peculiar
merit
scientific
truth
is
the
remotest
of
mistresses
she
hides
in
strange
places
she
is
attained
by
tortuous
and
laborious
roads
but
she
is
always
there
win
to
her
and
she
will
not
fail
you
she
is
yours
and
mankind
s
for
ever
she
is
reality
the
one
reality
i
have
found
in
this
strange
disorder
of
existence
she
will
not
sulk
with
you
nor
misunderstand
you
nor
cheat
you
of
your
reward
upon
some
petty
doubt
you
can
not
change
her
by
advertisement
or
clamour
nor
stifle
her
in
vulgarities
things
grow
under
your
hands
when
you
serve
her
things
that
are
permanent
as
nothing
else
is
permanent
in
the
whole
life
of
man
that
i
think
is
the
peculiar
satisfaction
of
science
and
its
enduring
reward
the
taking
up
of
experimental
work
produced
a
great
change
in
my
personal
habits
i
have
told
how
already
once
in
my
life
at
wimblehurst
i
had
a
period
of
discipline
and
continuous
effort
and
how
when
i
came
to
south
kensington
i
became
demoralised
by
the
immense
effect
of
london
by
its
innumerable
imperative
demands
upon
my
attention
and
curiosity
and
i
parted
with
much
of
my
personal
pride
when
i
gave
up
science
for
the
development
of
but
my
poverty
kept
me
abstinent
and
my
youthful
romanticism
kept
me
chaste
until
my
married
life
was
well
under
way
then
in
all
directions
i
relaxed
i
did
a
large
amount
of
work
but
i
never
troubled
to
think
whether
it
was
my
maximum
nor
whether
the
moods
and
indolences
that
came
to
me
at
times
were
avoidable
things
with
the
coming
of
plenty
i
ate
abundantly
and
foolishly
drank
freely
and
followed
my
impulses
more
and
more
carelessly
i
felt
no
reason
why
i
should
do
anything
else
never
at
any
point
did
i
use
myself
to
the
edge
of
my
capacity
the
emotional
crisis
of
my
divorce
did
not
produce
any
immediate
change
in
these
matters
of
personal
discipline
i
found
some
difficulty
at
first
in
concentrating
my
mind
upon
scientific
work
it
was
so
much
more
exacting
than
business
but
i
got
over
that
difficulty
by
smoking
i
became
an
inordinate
cigar
smoker
it
gave
me
moods
of
profound
depression
but
i
treated
these
usually
by
the
homeopathic
method
by
lighting
another
cigar
i
didn
t
realise
at
all
how
loose
my
moral
and
nervous
fibre
had
become
until
i
reached
the
practical
side
of
my
investigations
and
was
face
to
face
with
the
necessity
of
finding
out
just
how
it
felt
to
use
a
glider
and
just
what
a
man
could
do
with
one
i
got
into
this
relaxed
habit
of
living
in
spite
of
very
real
tendencies
in
my
nature
towards
discipline
i
ve
never
been
in
love
with
that
philosophy
of
the
loose
lip
and
the
lax
paunch
is
one
for
which
i
ve
always
had
an
instinctive
distrust
i
like
bare
things
stripped
things
plain
austere
and
continent
things
fine
lines
and
cold
colours
but
in
these
plethoric
times
when
there
is
too
much
coarse
stuff
for
everybody
and
the
struggle
for
life
takes
the
form
of
competitive
advertisement
and
the
effort
to
fill
your
neighbour
s
eye
when
there
is
no
urgent
demand
either
for
personal
courage
sound
nerves
or
stark
beauty
we
find
ourselves
by
accident
always
before
these
times
the
bulk
of
the
people
did
not
themselves
because
they
couldn
t
whether
they
wanted
to
do
so
or
not
and
all
but
a
very
few
were
kept
fit
by
unavoidable
exercise
and
personal
danger
now
if
only
he
pitch
his
standard
low
enough
and
keep
free
from
pride
almost
any
one
can
achieve
a
sort
of
excess
you
can
go
through
contemporary
life
fudging
and
evading
indulging
and
slacking
never
really
hungry
nor
frightened
nor
passionately
stirred
your
highest
moment
a
mere
sentimental
orgasm
and
your
first
real
contact
with
primary
and
elemental
necessities
the
sweat
of
your
so
i
think
it
was
with
my
uncle
so
very
nearly
it
was
with
me
but
the
glider
brought
me
up
smartly
i
had
to
find
out
how
these
things
went
down
the
air
and
the
only
way
to
find
out
is
to
go
down
with
one
and
for
a
time
i
wouldn
t
face
it
there
is
something
impersonal
about
a
book
i
suppose
at
any
rate
i
find
myself
able
to
write
down
here
just
the
confession
i
ve
never
been
able
to
make
to
any
one
face
to
face
the
frightful
trouble
it
was
to
me
to
bring
myself
to
do
what
i
suppose
every
other
coloured
boy
in
the
west
indies
could
do
without
turning
a
hair
and
that
is
to
fling
myself
off
for
my
first
soar
down
the
wind
the
first
trial
was
bound
to
be
the
worst
it
was
an
experiment
i
made
with
life
and
the
chance
of
death
or
injury
was
i
supposed
about
equal
to
the
chance
of
success
i
believed
that
with
a
lucidity
i
had
begun
with
a
glider
that
i
imagined
was
on
the
lines
of
the
wright
brothers
aeroplane
but
i
could
not
be
sure
it
might
turn
over
i
might
upset
it
it
might
burrow
its
nose
at
the
end
and
smash
itself
and
me
the
conditions
of
the
flight
necessitated
alert
attention
it
wasn
t
a
thing
to
be
done
by
jumping
off
and
shutting
one
s
eyes
or
getting
angry
or
drunk
to
do
it
one
had
to
use
one
s
weight
to
balance
and
when
at
last
i
did
it
it
was
horrible
for
ten
seconds
for
ten
seconds
or
so
as
i
swept
down
the
air
flattened
on
my
infernal
framework
and
with
the
wind
in
my
eyes
the
rush
of
the
ground
beneath
me
filled
me
with
sick
and
helpless
terror
i
felt
as
though
some
violent
oscillatory
current
was
throbbing
in
brain
and
back
bone
and
i
groaned
aloud
i
set
my
teeth
and
groaned
it
was
a
groan
wrung
out
of
me
in
spite
of
myself
my
sensations
of
terror
swooped
to
a
climax
and
then
you
know
they
ended
suddenly
my
terror
was
over
and
done
with
i
was
soaring
through
the
air
right
way
up
steadily
and
no
mischance
had
happened
i
felt
intensely
alive
and
my
nerves
were
strung
like
a
bow
i
shifted
a
limb
swerved
and
shouted
between
fear
and
triumph
as
i
recovered
from
the
swerve
and
heeled
the
other
way
and
steadied
myself
i
thought
i
was
going
to
hit
a
rook
that
was
flying
athwart
me
it
was
queer
with
what
projectile
silence
that
jumped
upon
me
out
of
nothingness
and
i
yelled
helplessly
get
out
of
the
way
the
bird
doubled
itself
up
like
a
partly
inverted
v
flapped
went
up
to
the
right
abruptly
and
vanished
from
my
circle
of
interest
then
i
saw
the
shadow
of
my
aeroplane
keeping
a
fixed
distance
before
me
and
very
steady
and
the
turf
as
it
seemed
streaming
out
behind
it
the
turf
it
wasn
t
after
all
streaming
so
impossibly
fast
when
i
came
gliding
down
to
the
safe
spread
of
level
green
i
had
chosen
i
was
as
cool
and
ready
as
a
city
clerk
who
drops
off
an
omnibus
in
motion
and
i
had
learnt
much
more
than
soaring
i
tilted
up
her
nose
at
the
right
moment
levelled
again
and
grounded
like
a
snowflake
on
a
windless
day
i
lay
flat
for
an
instant
and
then
knelt
up
and
got
on
my
feet
atremble
but
very
satisfied
with
myself
cothope
was
running
down
the
hill
to
me
but
from
that
day
i
went
into
training
and
i
kept
myself
in
training
for
many
months
i
had
delayed
my
experiments
for
very
nearly
six
weeks
on
various
excuses
because
of
my
dread
of
this
first
flight
because
of
the
slackness
of
body
and
spirit
that
had
come
to
me
with
the
business
life
the
shame
of
that
cowardice
spurred
me
none
the
less
because
it
was
probably
altogether
my
own
secret
i
felt
that
cothope
at
any
rate
might
suspect
well
he
shouldn
t
suspect
again
it
is
curious
that
i
remember
that
shame
and
self
accusation
and
its
consequences
far
more
distinctly
than
i
recall
the
weeks
of
vacillation
before
i
soared
for
a
time
i
went
altogether
without
alcohol
i
stopped
smoking
altogether
and
ate
very
sparingly
and
every
day
i
did
something
that
called
a
little
upon
my
nerves
and
muscles
i
soared
as
frequently
as
i
could
i
substituted
a
for
the
london
train
and
took
my
chances
in
the
southward
traffic
and
i
even
tried
what
thrills
were
to
be
got
upon
a
horse
but
they
put
me
on
made
horses
and
i
conceived
a
perhaps
unworthy
contempt
for
the
certitudes
of
equestrian
exercise
in
comparison
with
the
adventures
of
mechanism
also
i
walked
along
the
high
wall
at
the
back
of
lady
grove
garden
and
at
last
brought
myself
to
stride
the
gap
where
the
gate
comes
if
i
didn
t
altogether
get
rid
of
a
certain
giddy
instinct
by
such
exercises
at
least
i
trained
my
will
until
it
didn
t
matter
and
soon
i
no
longer
dreaded
flight
but
was
eager
to
go
higher
into
the
air
and
i
came
to
esteem
soaring
upon
a
glider
that
even
over
the
deepest
dip
in
the
ground
had
barely
forty
feet
of
fall
beneath
it
a
mere
mockery
of
what
flight
might
be
i
began
to
dream
of
the
keener
freshness
in
the
air
high
above
the
beechwoods
and
it
was
rather
to
satisfy
that
desire
than
as
any
legitimate
development
of
my
proper
work
that
presently
i
turned
a
part
of
my
energies
and
the
bulk
of
my
private
income
to
the
problem
of
the
navigable
balloon
ii
i
had
gone
far
beyond
that
initial
stage
i
had
had
two
smashes
and
a
broken
rib
which
my
aunt
nursed
with
great
energy
and
was
getting
some
reputation
in
the
aeronautic
world
when
suddenly
as
though
she
had
never
really
left
it
the
honourable
beatrice
normandy
and
with
the
old
disorderly
wave
of
the
hair
from
her
brow
came
back
into
my
life
she
came
riding
down
a
grass
path
in
the
thickets
below
lady
grove
perched
up
on
a
huge
black
horse
and
the
old
earl
of
carnaby
and
archie
garvell
her
were
with
her
my
uncle
had
been
bothering
me
about
the
crest
hill
pipes
and
we
were
returning
by
a
path
transverse
to
theirs
and
came
out
upon
them
suddenly
old
carnaby
was
trespassing
on
our
ground
and
so
he
hailed
us
in
a
friendly
fashion
and
pulled
up
to
talk
to
us
i
didn
t
note
beatrice
at
all
at
first
i
was
interested
in
lord
carnaby
that
remarkable
vestige
of
his
own
brilliant
youth
i
had
heard
of
him
but
never
seen
him
for
a
man
of
who
had
sinned
all
the
sins
so
they
said
and
laid
waste
the
most
magnificent
political
debut
of
any
man
of
his
generation
he
seemed
to
me
to
be
looking
remarkably
fit
and
fresh
he
was
a
lean
little
man
with
eyes
in
his
brown
face
and
his
cracked
voice
was
the
worst
thing
in
his
effect
hope
you
don
t
mind
us
coming
this
way
ponderevo
he
cried
and
my
uncle
who
was
sometimes
a
little
too
general
and
generous
with
titles
answered
not
at
all
my
lord
not
at
all
glad
you
make
use
of
it
you
re
building
a
great
place
over
the
hill
said
carnaby
thought
i
d
make
a
show
for
once
said
my
uncle
it
looks
big
because
it
s
spread
out
for
the
air
and
sunlight
said
the
earl
you
can
t
have
too
much
of
them
but
before
our
time
they
used
to
build
for
shelter
and
water
and
the
high
then
i
discovered
that
the
silent
figure
behind
the
earl
was
beatrice
i
d
forgotten
her
sufficiently
to
think
for
a
moment
that
she
hadn
t
changed
at
all
since
she
had
watched
me
from
behind
the
skirts
of
lady
drew
she
was
looking
at
me
and
her
dainty
brow
under
her
broad
brimmed
hat
she
was
wearing
a
grey
hat
and
loose
unbuttoned
coat
was
knit
with
perplexity
trying
i
suppose
to
remember
where
she
had
seen
me
before
her
shaded
eyes
met
mine
with
that
mute
question
it
seemed
incredible
to
me
she
didn
t
remember
well
said
the
earl
and
touched
his
horse
garvell
was
patting
the
neck
of
his
horse
which
was
inclined
to
fidget
and
disregarding
me
he
nodded
over
his
shoulder
and
followed
his
movement
seemed
to
release
a
train
of
memories
in
her
she
glanced
suddenly
at
him
and
then
back
at
me
with
a
flash
of
recognition
that
warmed
instantly
to
a
faint
smile
she
hesitated
as
if
to
speak
to
me
smiled
broadly
and
understandingly
and
turned
to
follow
the
others
all
three
broke
into
a
canter
and
she
did
not
look
back
i
stood
for
a
second
or
so
at
the
crossing
of
the
lanes
watching
her
recede
and
then
became
aware
that
my
uncle
was
already
some
paces
off
and
talking
over
his
shoulder
in
the
belief
that
i
was
close
behind
i
turned
about
and
strode
to
overtake
him
my
mind
was
full
of
beatrice
and
this
surprise
i
remembered
her
simply
as
a
normandy
i
d
clean
forgotten
that
garvell
was
the
son
and
she
the
of
our
neighbour
lady
osprey
indeed
i
d
probably
forgotten
at
that
time
that
we
had
lady
osprey
as
a
neighbour
there
was
no
reason
at
all
for
remembering
it
it
was
amazing
to
find
her
in
this
surrey
countryside
when
i
d
never
thought
of
her
as
living
anywhere
in
the
world
but
at
bladesover
park
near
forty
miles
and
twenty
years
away
she
was
so
alive
so
unchanged
the
same
quick
warm
blood
was
in
her
cheeks
it
seemed
only
yesterday
that
we
had
kissed
among
the
bracken
stems
eh
i
said
i
say
he
s
good
stuff
said
my
uncle
you
can
say
what
you
like
against
the
aristocracy
george
lord
carnaby
s
rattling
good
stuff
there
s
a
sort
of
savoir
faire
something
it
s
an
phrase
george
but
a
good
one
there
s
a
it
s
like
the
oxford
turf
george
you
can
t
grow
it
in
a
year
i
wonder
how
they
do
it
it
s
living
always
on
a
scale
george
it
s
being
there
from
the
she
might
i
said
to
myself
be
a
picture
by
romney
come
alive
they
tell
all
these
stories
about
him
said
my
uncle
but
what
do
they
all
amount
to
gods
i
said
to
myself
but
why
have
i
forgotten
for
so
long
those
queer
little
brows
of
hers
the
touch
of
mischief
in
her
eyes
the
way
she
breaks
into
a
smile
i
don
t
blame
him
said
my
uncle
mostly
it
s
imagination
that
and
leisure
george
when
i
was
a
young
man
i
was
kept
pretty
busy
so
were
you
even
then
what
puzzled
me
more
particularly
was
the
queer
trick
of
my
memory
that
had
never
recalled
anything
vital
of
beatrice
whatever
when
i
met
garvell
again
that
had
indeed
recalled
nothing
except
a
boyish
antagonism
and
our
fight
now
when
my
senses
were
full
of
her
it
seemed
incredible
that
i
could
ever
have
forgotten
iii
oh
crikey
said
my
aunt
reading
a
letter
behind
her
here
s
a
young
woman
george
we
were
breakfasting
together
in
the
big
window
bay
at
lady
grove
that
looks
upon
the
iris
beds
my
uncle
was
in
london
i
sounded
an
interrogative
note
and
decapitated
an
egg
who
s
beatrice
normandy
asked
my
aunt
i
ve
not
heard
of
her
she
the
young
woman
yes
says
she
knows
you
i
m
no
hand
at
old
etiquette
george
but
her
line
is
a
bit
unusual
practically
she
says
she
s
going
to
make
her
mother
eh
isn
t
it
you
seem
to
know
a
lot
about
her
she
says
mother
lady
osprey
they
re
to
call
on
me
anyhow
next
wednesday
week
at
four
and
there
s
got
to
be
you
for
eh
you
for
tea
h
m
she
had
rather
force
of
character
when
i
knew
her
i
became
aware
of
my
aunt
s
head
sticking
out
obliquely
from
behind
the
and
regarding
me
with
wide
blue
curiosity
i
met
her
gaze
for
a
moment
flinched
coloured
and
laughed
i
ve
known
her
longer
than
i
ve
known
you
i
said
and
explained
at
length
my
aunt
kept
her
eye
on
me
over
and
round
the
as
i
did
so
she
was
greatly
interested
and
asked
several
elucidatory
questions
why
didn
t
you
tell
me
the
day
you
saw
her
you
ve
had
her
on
your
mind
for
a
week
she
said
it
is
odd
i
didn
t
tell
you
i
admitted
you
thought
i
d
get
a
down
on
her
said
my
aunt
conclusively
that
s
what
you
thought
and
opened
the
rest
of
her
letters
the
two
ladies
came
in
a
with
conspicuous
punctuality
and
i
had
the
unusual
experience
of
seeing
my
aunt
entertaining
callers
we
had
tea
upon
the
terrace
under
the
cedar
but
old
lady
osprey
being
an
embittered
protestant
had
never
before
seen
the
inside
of
the
house
and
we
made
a
sort
of
tour
of
inspection
that
reminded
me
of
my
first
visit
to
the
place
in
spite
of
my
preoccupation
with
beatrice
i
stored
a
queer
little
memory
of
the
contrast
between
the
two
other
women
my
aunt
tall
slender
and
awkward
in
a
simple
blue
homekeeping
dress
an
omnivorous
reader
and
a
very
authentic
wit
and
the
lady
of
pedigree
short
and
plump
dressed
with
victorian
fussiness
living
at
the
intellectual
level
of
palmistry
and
genteel
fiction
pink
in
the
face
and
generally
flustered
by
a
sense
of
my
aunt
s
social
strangeness
and
disposed
under
the
circumstances
to
behave
rather
like
an
imitation
of
the
more
queenly
moments
of
her
own
cook
the
one
seemed
made
of
whalebone
the
other
of
dough
my
aunt
was
nervous
partly
through
the
intrinsic
difficulty
of
handling
the
lady
and
partly
because
of
her
passionate
desire
to
watch
beatrice
and
me
and
her
nervousness
took
a
common
form
with
her
a
wider
clumsiness
of
gesture
and
an
exacerbation
of
her
habitual
oddity
of
phrase
which
did
much
to
deepen
the
pink
perplexity
of
the
lady
of
title
for
instance
i
heard
my
aunt
admit
that
one
of
the
stuart
durgan
ladies
did
look
a
bit
balmy
on
the
crumpet
she
described
the
knights
of
the
age
of
chivalry
as
korvorting
about
on
the
of
a
dragon
she
explained
she
was
always
old
mucking
about
the
garden
and
instead
of
offering
me
a
garibaldi
biscuit
she
asked
me
with
that
faint
lisp
of
hers
to
have
some
squashed
flies
i
felt
convinced
lady
osprey
would
describe
her
as
a
most
eccentric
person
on
the
very
first
opportunity
a
most
eccentric
one
could
see
her
as
people
say
shaping
for
that
beatrice
was
dressed
very
quietly
in
brown
with
a
simple
but
courageous
hat
and
an
unexpected
quality
of
being
and
responsible
she
guided
her
through
the
first
encounter
scrutinised
my
aunt
and
got
us
all
well
in
movement
through
the
house
and
then
she
turned
her
attention
to
me
with
a
quick
and
smile
we
haven
t
met
she
said
since
it
was
in
the
of
course
she
said
the
warren
i
remembered
it
all
except
just
the
name
i
was
her
smiling
eyes
insisted
on
my
memories
being
thorough
i
looked
up
and
met
them
squarely
a
little
at
a
loss
for
what
i
should
say
i
gave
you
away
pretty
completely
she
said
meditating
upon
my
face
and
afterwards
i
gave
way
she
turned
her
face
away
from
the
others
and
her
voice
fell
ever
so
little
they
gave
him
a
licking
for
telling
lies
she
said
as
though
that
was
a
pleasant
memory
and
when
it
was
all
over
i
went
to
our
wigwam
you
remember
the
wigwam
out
in
the
west
wood
yes
and
cried
for
all
the
evil
i
had
done
you
i
suppose
i
ve
often
thought
of
it
lady
osprey
stopped
for
us
to
overtake
her
my
dear
she
said
to
beatrice
such
a
beautiful
gallery
then
she
stared
very
hard
at
me
puzzled
in
the
most
naked
fashion
to
understand
who
i
might
be
people
say
the
oak
staircase
is
rather
good
said
my
aunt
and
led
the
way
lady
osprey
with
her
skirts
gathered
for
the
ascent
to
the
gallery
and
her
hand
on
the
newel
turned
and
addressed
a
look
full
of
meaning
overflowing
indeed
with
meanings
at
her
charge
the
chief
meaning
no
doubt
was
caution
about
myself
but
much
of
it
was
just
meaning
at
large
i
chanced
to
catch
the
response
in
a
mirror
and
detected
beatrice
with
her
nose
wrinkled
into
a
swift
and
entirely
diabolical
grimace
lady
osprey
became
a
deeper
shade
of
pink
and
speechless
with
indignation
it
was
evident
she
disavowed
all
further
responsibility
as
she
followed
my
aunt
upstairs
it
s
dark
but
there
s
a
sort
of
dignity
said
beatrice
very
distinctly
regarding
the
hall
with
serene
tranquillity
and
allowing
the
unwilling
feet
on
the
stairs
to
widen
their
distance
from
us
she
stood
a
step
up
so
that
she
looked
down
a
little
upon
me
and
over
me
at
the
old
hall
she
turned
upon
me
abruptly
when
she
thought
her
was
beyond
but
how
did
you
get
here
she
asked
here
all
she
indicated
space
and
leisure
by
a
wave
of
the
hand
at
hall
and
tall
windows
and
sunlit
terrace
weren
t
you
the
housekeeper
s
son
i
ve
adventured
my
uncle
has
become
a
great
financier
he
used
to
be
a
little
chemist
about
twenty
miles
from
bladesover
we
re
promoters
now
amalgamators
big
people
on
the
new
i
she
regarded
me
with
interested
eyes
visibly
thinking
me
out
and
you
recognised
me
i
asked
after
a
second
or
so
i
saw
you
recognised
me
i
couldn
t
place
you
but
i
knew
i
knew
you
then
archie
being
there
helped
me
to
i
m
glad
to
meet
again
i
ventured
i
d
never
forgotten
one
doesn
t
forget
those
childish
we
regarded
one
another
for
a
moment
with
a
curiously
easy
and
confident
satisfaction
in
coming
together
again
i
can
t
explain
our
ready
zest
in
one
another
the
thing
was
so
we
pleased
each
other
we
had
no
doubt
in
our
minds
that
we
pleased
each
other
from
the
first
we
were
at
our
ease
with
one
another
so
picturesque
so
very
picturesque
came
a
voice
from
above
and
then
i
ve
a
hundred
things
i
want
to
know
about
you
she
said
with
an
easy
intimacy
as
we
went
up
the
winding
steps
as
the
four
of
us
sat
at
tea
together
under
the
cedar
on
the
terrace
she
asked
questions
about
my
aeronautics
my
aunt
helped
with
a
word
or
so
about
my
broken
ribs
lady
osprey
evidently
regarded
flying
as
a
most
indesirable
and
improper
topic
a
blasphemous
intrusion
upon
the
angels
it
isn
t
flying
i
explained
we
don
t
fly
you
never
will
she
said
compactly
you
never
well
i
said
we
do
what
we
the
little
lady
lifted
a
small
gloved
hand
and
indicated
a
height
of
about
four
feet
from
the
ground
thus
far
she
said
thus
far
and
no
farther
no
she
became
emphatically
pink
no
she
said
again
quite
conclusively
and
coughed
shortly
thank
you
she
said
to
her
ninth
or
tenth
cake
beatrice
burst
into
cheerful
laughter
with
her
eye
on
me
i
was
lying
on
the
turf
and
this
perhaps
caused
a
slight
confusion
about
the
primordial
curse
in
lady
osprey
s
mind
upon
his
belly
shall
he
go
she
said
with
quiet
distinctness
all
the
days
of
his
after
which
we
talked
no
more
of
aeronautics
beatrice
sat
bunched
together
in
a
chair
and
regarded
me
with
exactly
the
same
scrutiny
i
thought
the
same
adventurous
aggression
that
i
had
faced
long
ago
at
the
in
my
mother
s
room
she
was
amazingly
like
that
little
princess
of
my
bladesover
memories
the
wilful
misbehaviours
of
her
hair
seemed
the
same
her
voice
things
one
would
have
expected
to
be
changed
altogether
she
formed
her
plans
in
the
same
quick
way
and
acted
with
the
same
irresponsible
decision
she
stood
up
abruptly
what
is
there
beyond
the
terrace
she
said
and
found
me
promptly
beside
her
i
invented
a
view
for
her
at
the
further
corner
from
the
cedar
she
perched
herself
up
upon
the
parapet
and
achieved
an
air
of
comfort
among
the
lichenous
stones
now
tell
me
she
said
all
about
yourself
tell
me
about
yourself
i
know
such
duffers
of
men
they
all
do
the
same
things
how
did
you
get
here
all
my
men
were
here
they
couldn
t
have
got
here
if
they
hadn
t
been
here
always
they
wouldn
t
have
thought
it
right
you
ve
if
it
s
climbing
i
said
she
went
off
at
a
tangent
it
s
i
don
t
know
if
you
ll
understand
interesting
to
meet
you
again
i
ve
remembered
you
i
don
t
know
why
but
i
have
i
ve
used
you
as
a
sort
of
lay
figure
when
i
ve
told
myself
stories
but
you
ve
always
been
rather
stiff
and
difficult
in
my
stories
in
clothes
a
labour
member
or
a
bradlaugh
or
something
like
that
you
re
not
like
that
a
bit
and
yet
you
are
she
looked
at
me
was
it
much
of
a
fight
they
make
out
it
i
don
t
know
i
was
shot
up
here
by
an
accident
i
said
there
was
no
fight
at
all
except
to
keep
honest
perhaps
and
i
made
no
great
figure
in
that
i
and
my
uncle
mixed
a
medicine
and
it
blew
us
up
no
merit
in
that
but
you
ve
been
here
all
the
time
tell
me
what
you
have
done
one
thing
we
didn
t
she
meditated
for
a
moment
what
said
i
produce
a
little
for
bladesover
so
it
went
to
the
phillbrick
gang
and
they
let
it
and
i
and
my
we
let
too
and
live
in
a
little
she
nodded
her
head
vaguely
over
her
shoulder
and
turned
to
me
again
well
suppose
it
was
an
accident
here
you
are
now
you
re
here
what
are
you
going
to
do
you
re
young
is
it
to
be
parliament
heard
some
men
the
other
day
talking
about
you
before
i
knew
you
were
you
they
said
that
was
what
you
ought
to
she
put
me
through
my
intentions
with
a
close
and
vital
curiosity
it
was
just
as
she
had
tried
to
imagine
me
a
soldier
and
place
me
years
ago
she
made
me
feel
more
planless
and
incidental
than
ever
you
want
to
make
a
she
pursued
and
when
you
fly
what
then
would
it
be
for
fighting
i
told
her
something
of
my
experimental
work
she
had
never
heard
of
the
soaring
aeroplane
and
was
excited
by
the
thought
and
keen
to
hear
about
it
she
had
thought
all
the
work
so
far
had
been
a
mere
projecting
of
impossible
machines
for
her
pilcher
and
lilienthal
had
died
in
vain
she
did
not
know
such
men
had
lived
in
the
world
but
that
s
dangerous
she
said
with
a
note
of
discovery
oh
it
s
lady
osprey
called
beatrice
dropped
from
the
wall
to
her
feet
where
do
you
do
this
soaring
beyond
the
high
barrows
east
of
crest
hill
and
the
do
you
mind
people
coming
to
see
whenever
you
please
only
let
me
know
i
ll
take
my
chance
some
day
some
day
she
looked
at
me
thoughtfully
smiled
and
our
talk
was
at
an
end
iv
all
my
later
work
in
aeronautics
is
associated
in
my
memory
with
the
quality
of
beatrice
with
her
incidental
presence
with
things
she
said
and
did
and
things
i
thought
of
that
had
reference
to
her
in
the
spring
of
that
year
i
had
got
to
a
flying
machine
that
lacked
nothing
but
longitudinal
stability
my
model
flew
like
a
bird
for
fifty
or
a
hundred
yards
or
so
and
then
either
dived
and
broke
its
nose
or
what
was
commoner
reared
up
slid
back
and
smashed
its
propeller
the
rhythm
of
the
pitching
puzzled
me
i
felt
it
must
obey
some
laws
not
yet
quite
clearly
stated
i
became
therefore
a
student
of
theory
and
literature
for
a
time
i
hit
upon
the
string
of
considerations
that
led
me
to
what
is
called
ponderevo
s
principle
and
my
and
i
worked
this
out
in
three
long
papers
meanwhile
i
made
a
lot
of
and
glider
models
and
started
in
upon
an
idea
of
combining
and
gliders
balloon
work
was
new
to
me
i
had
made
one
or
two
ascents
in
the
balloons
of
the
aero
club
before
i
started
my
gasometer
and
the
balloon
shed
and
gave
cothope
a
couple
of
months
with
sir
peter
rumchase
my
uncle
found
part
of
the
money
for
these
developments
he
was
growing
interested
and
competitive
in
this
business
because
of
lord
boom
s
prize
and
the
amount
of
reclame
involved
and
it
was
at
his
request
that
i
named
my
first
navigable
balloon
lord
roberts
alpha
lord
roberts
a
very
nearly
terminated
all
my
investigations
my
idea
both
in
this
and
its
more
successful
and
famous
younger
brother
lord
roberts
b
was
to
utilise
the
idea
of
a
contractile
balloon
with
a
rigid
flat
base
a
balloon
shaped
rather
like
an
inverted
boat
that
should
almost
support
the
apparatus
but
not
quite
the
was
of
the
chambered
sort
used
for
these
long
forms
and
not
with
an
internal
balloonette
the
trouble
was
to
make
the
thing
contractile
this
i
sought
to
do
by
fixing
a
long
silk
net
over
it
that
was
fastened
to
be
rolled
up
on
two
longitudinal
rods
practically
i
contracted
my
sausage
by
netting
it
down
the
ends
were
too
complex
for
me
to
describe
here
but
i
thought
them
out
elaborately
and
they
were
very
carefully
planned
lord
roberts
a
was
furnished
with
a
single
big
screw
forward
and
there
was
a
rudder
aft
the
engine
was
the
first
one
to
be
so
to
speak
right
in
the
plane
of
the
i
lay
immediately
under
the
balloon
on
a
sort
of
glider
framework
far
away
from
either
engine
or
rudder
controlling
them
by
constructed
on
the
principle
of
the
bowden
brake
of
the
cyclist
but
lord
roberts
a
has
been
pretty
exhaustively
figured
and
described
in
various
aeronautical
publications
the
unforeseen
defect
was
the
badness
of
the
work
in
the
silk
netting
it
tore
aft
as
soon
as
i
began
to
contract
the
balloon
and
the
last
two
segments
immediately
bulged
through
the
hole
exactly
as
an
inner
tube
will
bulge
through
the
ruptured
outer
cover
of
a
pneumatic
tire
and
then
the
sharp
edge
of
the
torn
net
cut
the
of
the
distended
last
segment
along
a
weak
seam
and
burst
it
with
a
loud
report
up
to
that
point
the
whole
thing
had
been
going
on
extremely
well
as
a
navigable
balloon
and
before
i
contracted
it
the
lord
roberts
a
was
an
unqualified
success
it
had
run
out
of
the
shed
admirably
at
nine
or
ten
miles
an
hour
or
more
and
although
there
was
a
gentle
southwester
blowing
it
had
gone
up
and
turned
and
faced
it
as
well
as
any
craft
of
the
sort
i
have
ever
seen
i
lay
in
my
customary
glider
position
horizontal
and
face
downward
and
the
invisibility
of
all
the
machinery
gave
an
extraordinary
effect
of
independent
levitation
only
by
looking
up
as
it
were
and
turning
my
head
back
could
i
see
the
flat
aeroplane
bottom
of
the
balloon
and
the
rapid
successive
passages
swish
swish
swish
of
the
vans
of
the
propeller
i
made
a
wide
circle
over
lady
grove
and
duffield
and
out
towards
effingham
and
came
back
quite
successfully
to
the
down
below
in
the
october
sunlight
were
my
sheds
and
the
little
group
that
had
been
summoned
to
witness
the
start
their
faces
craned
upward
and
most
of
them
scrutinising
my
expression
through
i
could
see
carnaby
and
beatrice
on
horseback
and
two
girls
i
did
not
know
with
them
cothope
and
three
or
four
workmen
i
employed
my
aunt
and
levinstein
who
was
staying
with
her
on
foot
and
dimmock
the
veterinary
surgeon
and
one
or
two
others
my
shadow
moved
a
little
to
the
north
of
them
like
the
shadow
of
a
fish
at
lady
grove
the
servants
were
out
on
the
lawn
and
the
duffield
school
playground
swarmed
with
children
too
indifferent
to
aeronautics
to
cease
their
playing
but
in
the
crest
hill
direction
the
place
looked
extraordinarily
squat
and
ugly
from
above
there
were
knots
and
strings
of
staring
workmen
everywhere
not
one
of
them
working
but
all
agape
but
now
i
write
it
it
occurs
to
me
that
perhaps
it
was
their
dinner
hour
it
was
certainly
near
twelve
i
hung
for
a
moment
or
so
enjoying
the
soar
then
turned
about
to
face
a
clear
stretch
of
open
down
let
the
engine
out
to
full
speed
and
set
my
rollers
at
work
rolling
in
the
net
and
so
tightening
the
instantly
the
pace
quickened
with
the
diminished
resistance
in
that
moment
before
the
bang
i
think
i
must
have
been
really
flying
before
the
net
ripped
just
in
the
instant
when
my
balloon
was
at
its
systole
the
whole
apparatus
was
i
am
convinced
heavier
than
air
that
however
is
a
claim
that
has
been
disputed
and
in
any
case
this
sort
of
priority
is
a
very
trivial
thing
then
came
a
sudden
retardation
instantly
followed
by
an
inexpressibly
disconcerting
tilt
downward
of
the
machine
that
i
still
recall
with
horror
i
couldn
t
see
what
was
happening
at
all
and
i
couldn
t
imagine
it
was
a
mysterious
inexplicable
dive
the
thing
it
seemed
without
rhyme
or
reason
was
kicking
up
its
heels
in
the
air
the
bang
followed
immediately
and
i
perceived
i
was
falling
rapidly
i
was
too
much
taken
by
surprise
to
think
of
the
proper
cause
of
the
report
i
don
t
even
know
what
i
made
of
it
i
was
obsessed
i
suppose
by
that
perpetual
dread
of
the
modern
aeronaut
a
flash
between
engine
and
balloon
yet
obviously
i
wasn
t
wrapped
in
flames
i
ought
to
have
realised
instantly
it
wasn
t
that
i
did
at
any
rate
whatever
other
impressions
there
were
release
the
winding
of
the
outer
net
and
let
the
balloon
expand
again
and
that
no
doubt
did
something
to
break
my
fall
i
don
t
remember
doing
that
indeed
all
i
do
remember
is
the
giddy
effect
upon
the
landscape
of
falling
swiftly
upon
it
down
a
flat
spiral
the
hurried
rush
of
fields
and
trees
and
cottages
on
my
left
shoulder
and
the
overhung
feeling
as
if
the
whole
apparatus
was
pressing
down
the
top
of
my
head
i
didn
t
stop
or
attempt
to
stop
the
screw
that
was
going
on
swish
swish
swish
all
the
time
cothope
really
knows
more
about
the
fall
than
i
do
he
describes
the
easterly
start
the
tilt
and
the
appearance
and
bursting
of
a
sort
of
bladder
aft
then
down
i
swooped
very
swiftly
but
not
nearly
so
steeply
as
i
imagined
i
was
doing
fifteen
or
twenty
degrees
said
cothope
to
be
from
him
it
was
that
i
learnt
that
i
let
the
nets
loose
again
and
so
arrested
my
fall
he
thinks
i
was
more
in
control
of
myself
than
i
remember
but
i
do
not
see
why
i
should
have
forgotten
so
excellent
a
resolution
his
impression
is
that
i
was
really
steering
and
trying
to
drop
into
the
farthing
down
beeches
you
hit
the
trees
he
said
and
the
whole
affair
stood
on
its
nose
among
them
and
then
very
slowly
crumpled
up
i
saw
you
d
been
jerked
out
as
i
thought
and
i
didn
t
stay
for
more
i
rushed
for
my
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
purely
accidental
that
i
came
down
in
the
woods
i
am
reasonably
certain
that
i
had
no
more
control
then
than
a
thing
in
a
parcel
i
remember
i
felt
a
sort
of
wincing
now
it
comes
as
the
trees
rushed
up
to
me
if
i
remember
that
i
should
remember
steering
then
the
propeller
smashed
everything
stopped
with
a
jerk
and
i
was
falling
into
a
mass
of
yellowing
leaves
and
lord
roberts
a
so
it
seemed
to
me
was
going
back
into
the
sky
i
felt
twigs
and
things
hit
me
in
the
face
but
i
didn
t
feel
injured
at
the
time
i
clutched
at
things
that
broke
tumbled
through
a
froth
of
green
and
yellow
into
a
shadowy
world
of
great
arms
and
there
snatching
wildly
got
a
grip
on
a
fair
round
branch
and
hung
i
became
intensely
alert
and
i
held
by
that
branch
for
a
moment
and
then
looked
about
me
and
caught
at
another
and
then
found
myself
holding
to
a
practicable
fork
i
swung
forward
to
that
and
got
a
leg
around
it
below
its
junction
and
so
was
able
presently
to
clamber
down
climbing
very
coolly
and
deliberately
i
dropped
ten
feet
or
so
from
the
lowest
branch
and
fell
on
my
feet
that
s
all
right
i
said
and
stared
up
through
the
tree
to
see
what
i
could
of
the
deflated
and
crumpled
remains
that
had
once
been
lord
roberts
a
festooned
on
the
branches
it
had
broken
gods
i
said
what
a
tumble
i
wiped
something
that
trickled
from
my
face
and
was
shocked
to
see
my
hand
covered
with
blood
i
looked
at
myself
and
saw
what
seemed
to
me
an
astonishing
quantity
of
blood
running
down
my
arm
and
shoulder
i
perceived
my
mouth
was
full
of
blood
it
s
a
queer
moment
when
one
realises
one
is
hurt
and
perhaps
badly
hurt
and
has
still
to
discover
just
how
far
one
is
hurt
i
explored
my
face
carefully
and
found
unfamiliar
contours
on
the
left
side
the
broken
end
of
a
branch
had
driven
right
through
my
cheek
damaging
my
cheek
and
teeth
and
gums
and
left
a
splinter
of
itself
stuck
like
an
explorer
s
flag
in
the
upper
maxillary
that
and
a
sprained
wrist
were
all
my
damage
but
i
bled
as
though
i
had
been
chopped
to
pieces
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
my
face
had
been
driven
in
i
can
t
describe
just
the
horrible
disgust
i
felt
at
that
this
blood
must
be
stopped
anyhow
i
said
thickheadedly
i
wonder
where
there
s
a
spider
s
web
an
odd
twist
for
my
mind
to
take
but
it
was
the
only
treatment
that
occurred
to
me
i
must
have
conceived
some
idea
of
going
home
unaided
because
i
was
thirty
yards
from
the
tree
before
i
dropped
then
a
kind
of
black
disc
appeared
in
the
middle
of
the
world
and
rushed
out
to
the
edge
of
things
and
blotted
them
out
i
don
t
remember
falling
down
i
fainted
from
excitement
disgust
at
my
injury
and
loss
of
blood
and
lay
there
until
cothope
found
me
he
was
the
first
to
find
me
scorching
as
he
did
over
the
downland
turf
and
making
a
wide
course
to
get
the
carnaby
plantations
at
their
narrowest
then
presently
while
he
was
trying
to
apply
the
methodical
teachings
of
the
john
s
ambulance
classes
to
a
rather
abnormal
case
beatrice
came
galloping
through
the
trees
with
lord
carnaby
hard
behind
her
and
she
was
hatless
muddy
from
a
fall
and
white
as
death
and
cool
as
a
cucumber
too
said
cothope
turning
it
over
in
his
mind
as
he
told
me
they
never
seem
quite
to
have
their
heads
and
never
seem
quite
to
lose
em
said
cothope
generalising
about
the
sex
also
he
witnessed
she
acted
with
remarkable
decision
the
question
was
whether
i
should
be
taken
to
the
house
her
occupied
at
bedley
corner
the
carnaby
dower
house
or
down
to
carnaby
s
place
at
easting
beatrice
had
no
doubt
in
the
matter
for
she
meant
to
nurse
me
carnaby
didn
t
seem
to
want
that
to
happen
she
would
have
it
wasn
t
half
so
far
said
cothope
she
faced
us
out
i
hate
to
be
faced
out
of
my
opinion
so
i
ve
taken
a
pedometer
over
it
since
it
s
exactly
yards
further
lord
carnaby
looked
at
her
pretty
straight
said
cothope
finishing
the
picture
and
then
he
give
v
but
my
story
has
made
a
jump
from
june
to
october
and
during
that
time
my
relations
with
beatrice
and
the
countryside
that
was
her
setting
had
developed
in
many
directions
she
came
and
went
moving
in
an
orbit
for
which
i
had
no
data
going
to
london
and
paris
into
wales
and
northampton
while
her
stepmother
on
some
independent
system
of
her
own
also
vanished
and
recurred
intermittently
at
home
they
obeyed
the
rule
of
an
inflexible
old
maid
charlotte
and
beatrice
exercised
all
the
rights
of
proprietorship
in
carnaby
s
extensive
stables
her
interest
in
me
was
from
the
first
undisguised
she
found
her
way
to
my
worksheds
and
developed
rapidly
in
spite
of
the
sincere
discouragement
of
cothope
into
a
keen
amateur
of
aeronautics
she
would
come
sometimes
in
the
morning
sometimes
in
the
afternoon
sometimes
afoot
with
an
irish
terrier
sometimes
riding
she
would
come
for
three
or
four
days
every
day
vanish
for
a
fortnight
or
three
weeks
return
it
was
not
long
before
i
came
to
look
for
her
from
the
first
i
found
her
immensely
interesting
to
me
she
was
a
new
feminine
type
altogether
i
have
made
it
plain
i
think
how
limited
was
my
knowledge
of
women
but
she
made
me
not
simply
interested
in
her
but
in
myself
she
became
for
me
something
that
greatly
changes
a
man
s
world
how
shall
i
put
it
she
became
an
audience
since
i
ve
emerged
from
the
emotional
developments
of
the
affair
i
have
thought
it
out
in
a
hundred
aspects
and
it
does
seem
to
me
that
this
way
in
which
men
and
women
make
audiences
for
one
another
is
a
curiously
influential
force
in
their
lives
for
some
it
seems
an
audience
is
a
vital
necessity
they
seek
audiences
as
creatures
seek
food
others
again
my
uncle
among
them
can
play
to
an
imaginary
audience
i
i
think
have
lived
and
can
live
without
one
in
my
adolescence
i
was
my
own
audience
and
my
own
court
of
honour
and
to
have
an
audience
in
one
s
mind
is
to
play
a
part
to
become
and
dramatic
for
many
years
i
had
been
and
scientific
i
had
lived
for
work
and
impersonal
interests
until
i
found
scrutiny
applause
and
expectation
in
beatrice
s
eyes
then
i
began
to
live
for
the
effect
i
imagined
i
made
upon
her
to
make
that
very
soon
the
principal
value
in
my
life
i
played
to
her
i
did
things
for
the
look
of
them
i
began
to
dream
more
and
more
of
beautiful
situations
and
fine
poses
and
groupings
with
her
and
for
her
i
put
these
things
down
because
they
puzzle
me
i
think
i
was
in
love
with
beatrice
as
being
in
love
is
usually
understood
but
it
was
quite
a
different
state
altogether
from
my
passionate
hunger
for
marion
or
my
keen
sensuous
desire
for
and
pleasure
in
effie
these
were
selfish
sincere
things
fundamental
and
instinctive
as
sincere
as
the
leap
of
a
tiger
but
until
matters
drew
to
a
crisis
with
beatrice
there
was
an
immense
imaginative
insurgence
of
a
quite
different
quality
i
am
setting
down
here
very
gravely
and
perhaps
absurdly
what
are
no
doubt
elementary
commonplaces
for
innumerable
people
this
love
that
grew
up
between
beatrice
and
myself
was
i
think
i
put
it
quite
tentatively
and
rather
curiously
romantic
love
that
unfortunate
and
truncated
affair
of
my
uncle
and
the
scrymgeour
lady
was
really
of
the
same
stuff
if
a
little
different
in
quality
i
have
to
admit
that
the
factor
of
audience
was
of
primary
importance
in
either
else
its
effect
upon
me
was
to
make
me
in
many
respects
adolescent
again
it
made
me
keener
upon
the
point
of
honour
and
anxious
and
eager
to
do
high
and
splendid
things
and
in
particular
brave
things
so
far
it
ennobled
and
upheld
me
but
it
did
also
push
me
towards
vulgar
and
showy
things
at
bottom
it
was
disingenuous
it
gave
my
life
the
quality
of
stage
scenery
with
one
side
to
the
audience
another
side
that
wasn
t
meant
to
show
and
an
economy
of
substance
it
certainly
robbed
my
work
of
high
patience
and
quality
i
cut
down
the
toil
of
research
in
my
eagerness
and
her
eagerness
for
fine
flourishes
in
the
air
flights
that
would
tell
i
shirked
the
longer
road
and
it
robbed
me
too
of
any
fine
perception
of
absurdity
yet
that
was
not
everything
in
our
relationship
the
elemental
thing
was
there
also
it
came
in
very
suddenly
it
was
one
day
in
the
summer
though
i
do
not
now
recall
without
reference
to
my
experimental
memoranda
whether
it
was
in
july
or
august
i
was
working
with
a
new
and
more
aeroplane
with
wing
curvatures
studied
from
lilienthal
pilcher
and
phillips
that
i
thought
would
give
a
different
rhythm
for
the
pitching
oscillations
than
anything
i
d
had
before
i
was
soaring
my
long
course
from
the
framework
on
the
old
barrow
by
my
sheds
down
to
tinker
s
corner
it
is
a
clear
stretch
of
downland
except
for
two
or
three
thickets
of
box
and
thorn
to
the
right
of
my
course
one
transverse
trough
in
which
there
is
bush
and
a
small
rabbit
warren
comes
in
from
the
east
i
had
started
and
was
very
intent
on
the
peculiar
long
swoop
with
which
any
new
arrangement
flew
then
without
any
sort
of
notice
right
ahead
of
me
appeared
beatrice
riding
towards
tinker
s
corner
to
waylay
and
talk
to
me
she
looked
round
over
her
shoulder
saw
me
coming
touched
her
horse
to
a
gallop
and
then
the
brute
bolted
right
into
the
path
of
my
machine
there
was
a
queer
moment
of
doubt
whether
we
shouldn
t
all
smash
together
i
had
to
make
up
my
mind
very
quickly
whether
i
would
and
drop
backward
at
once
and
take
my
chance
of
falling
undamaged
a
poor
chance
it
would
have
been
in
order
to
avoid
any
risk
to
her
or
whether
i
would
lift
against
the
wind
and
soar
right
over
her
this
latter
i
did
she
had
already
got
her
horse
in
hand
when
i
came
up
to
her
her
woman
s
body
lay
along
his
neck
and
she
glanced
up
as
i
with
wings
aspread
and
every
nerve
in
a
state
of
tension
swept
over
her
then
i
had
landed
and
was
going
back
to
where
her
horse
stood
still
and
trembling
we
exchanged
no
greetings
she
slid
from
her
saddle
into
my
arms
and
for
one
instant
i
held
her
those
great
wings
she
said
and
that
was
all
she
lay
in
my
arms
and
i
thought
for
a
moment
she
had
fainted
very
near
a
nasty
accident
said
cothope
coming
up
and
regarding
our
grouping
with
disfavour
he
took
her
horse
by
the
bridle
very
dangerous
thing
coming
across
us
like
beatrice
disengaged
herself
from
me
stood
for
a
moment
trembling
and
then
sat
down
on
the
turf
i
ll
just
sit
down
for
a
moment
she
said
oh
she
said
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
while
cothope
looked
at
her
with
an
expression
between
suspicion
and
impatience
for
some
moments
nobody
moved
then
cothope
remarked
that
perhaps
he
d
better
get
her
water
as
for
me
i
was
filled
with
a
new
outrageous
idea
begotten
i
scarcely
know
how
from
this
incident
with
its
instant
contacts
and
swift
emotions
and
that
was
that
i
must
make
love
to
and
possess
beatrice
i
see
no
particular
reason
why
that
thought
should
have
come
to
me
in
that
moment
but
it
did
i
do
not
believe
that
before
then
i
had
thought
of
our
relations
in
such
terms
at
all
suddenly
as
i
remember
it
the
factor
of
passion
came
she
crouched
there
and
i
stood
over
her
and
neither
of
us
said
a
word
but
it
was
just
as
though
something
had
been
shouted
from
the
sky
cothope
had
gone
twenty
paces
perhaps
when
she
uncovered
her
face
i
shan
t
want
any
water
she
said
call
him
vi
after
that
the
spirit
of
our
relations
changed
the
old
ease
had
gone
she
came
to
me
less
frequently
and
when
she
came
she
would
have
some
one
with
her
usually
old
carnaby
and
he
would
do
the
bulk
of
the
talking
all
through
september
she
was
away
when
we
were
alone
together
there
was
a
curious
constraint
we
became
clouds
of
inexpressible
feeling
towards
one
another
we
could
think
of
nothing
that
was
not
too
momentous
for
words
then
came
the
smash
of
lord
roberts
a
and
i
found
myself
with
a
bandaged
face
in
a
bedroom
in
the
bedley
corner
with
beatrice
presiding
over
an
inefficient
nurse
lady
osprey
very
pink
and
shocked
in
the
background
and
my
aunt
jealously
intervening
my
injuries
were
much
more
showy
than
serious
and
i
could
have
been
taken
to
lady
grove
next
day
but
beatrice
would
not
permit
that
and
kept
me
at
bedley
corner
three
clear
days
in
the
afternoon
of
the
second
day
she
became
extremely
solicitous
for
the
proper
aeration
of
the
nurse
packed
her
off
for
an
hour
in
a
brisk
rain
and
sat
by
me
alone
i
asked
her
to
marry
me
all
the
whole
i
must
admit
it
was
not
a
situation
that
lent
itself
to
eloquence
i
lay
on
my
back
and
talked
through
bandages
and
with
some
little
difficulty
for
my
tongue
and
mouth
had
swollen
but
i
was
feverish
and
in
pain
and
the
emotional
suspense
i
had
been
in
so
long
with
regard
to
her
became
now
an
unendurable
impatience
comfortable
she
asked
shall
i
read
to
you
no
i
want
to
you
can
t
i
d
better
talk
to
no
i
said
i
want
to
talk
to
she
came
and
stood
by
my
bedside
and
looked
me
in
the
eyes
i
don
t
i
don
t
want
you
to
talk
to
me
she
said
i
thought
you
couldn
t
i
get
few
chances
of
you
d
better
not
talk
don
t
talk
now
let
me
chatter
instead
you
ought
not
to
it
isn
t
much
i
said
i
d
rather
you
didn
i
m
not
going
to
be
disfigured
i
said
only
a
oh
she
said
as
if
she
had
expected
something
quite
different
did
you
think
you
d
become
a
sort
of
gargoyle
l
homme
qui
rit
i
didn
t
know
but
that
s
all
right
jolly
flowers
those
are
michaelmas
daisies
she
said
i
m
glad
you
r
not
disfigured
and
those
are
perennial
sunflowers
do
you
know
no
flowers
at
all
when
i
saw
you
on
the
ground
i
certainly
thought
you
were
dead
you
ought
to
have
been
by
all
the
rules
of
the
she
said
some
other
things
but
i
was
thinking
of
my
next
move
are
we
social
equals
i
said
abruptly
she
stared
at
me
queer
question
she
said
but
are
we
h
m
difficult
to
say
but
why
do
you
ask
is
the
daughter
of
a
courtesy
baron
who
died
of
general
disreputableness
i
believe
before
his
father
i
give
it
up
does
it
matter
no
my
mind
is
confused
i
want
to
know
if
you
will
marry
she
whitened
and
said
nothing
i
suddenly
felt
i
must
plead
with
her
damn
these
bandages
i
said
breaking
into
ineffectual
febrile
rage
she
roused
herself
to
her
duties
as
nurse
what
are
you
doing
why
are
you
trying
to
sit
up
sit
down
don
t
touch
your
bandages
i
told
you
not
to
she
stood
helpless
for
a
moment
then
took
me
firmly
by
the
shoulders
and
pushed
me
back
upon
the
pillow
she
gripped
the
wrist
of
the
hand
i
had
raised
to
my
face
i
told
you
not
to
talk
she
whispered
close
to
my
face
i
asked
you
not
to
talk
why
couldn
t
you
do
as
i
asked
you
you
ve
been
avoiding
me
for
a
month
i
said
i
know
you
might
have
known
put
your
hand
back
down
by
your
i
obeyed
she
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
a
flush
had
come
to
her
cheeks
and
her
eyes
were
very
bright
i
asked
you
she
repeated
not
to
my
eyes
questioned
her
mutely
she
put
her
hand
on
my
chest
her
eyes
were
tormented
how
can
i
answer
you
now
she
said
how
can
i
say
anything
now
what
do
you
mean
i
asked
she
made
no
answer
do
you
mean
it
must
be
no
she
nodded
but
i
said
and
my
whole
soul
was
full
of
accusations
i
know
she
said
i
can
t
explain
i
can
t
but
it
has
to
be
no
it
can
t
be
it
s
utterly
finally
for
ever
impossible
keep
your
hands
still
but
i
said
when
we
met
again
i
can
t
marry
i
can
t
and
won
she
stood
up
why
did
you
talk
she
cried
couldn
t
you
see
she
seemed
to
have
something
it
was
impossible
to
say
she
came
to
the
table
beside
my
bed
and
pulled
the
michaelmas
daisies
awry
why
did
you
talk
like
that
she
said
in
a
tone
of
infinite
bitterness
to
begin
like
that
but
what
is
it
i
said
is
it
some
circumstance
my
social
position
oh
damn
your
social
position
she
cried
she
went
and
stood
at
the
further
window
staring
out
at
the
rain
for
a
long
time
we
were
absolutely
still
the
wind
and
rain
came
in
little
gusts
upon
the
pane
she
turned
to
me
abruptly
you
didn
t
ask
me
if
i
loved
you
she
said
oh
if
it
s
that
said
i
it
s
not
that
she
said
but
if
you
want
to
know
she
paused
i
do
she
said
we
stared
at
one
another
i
do
with
all
my
heart
if
you
want
to
then
why
the
devil
i
asked
she
made
no
answer
she
walked
across
the
room
to
the
piano
and
began
to
play
rather
noisily
and
rapidly
with
odd
gusts
of
emphasis
the
shepherd
s
pipe
music
from
the
last
act
in
tristan
and
presently
she
missed
a
note
failed
again
ran
her
finger
heavily
up
the
scale
struck
the
piano
passionately
with
her
fist
making
a
feeble
jar
in
the
treble
jumped
up
and
went
out
of
the
room
the
nurse
found
me
still
wearing
my
helmet
of
bandages
partially
dressed
and
pottering
round
the
room
to
find
the
rest
of
my
clothes
i
was
in
a
state
of
exasperated
hunger
for
beatrice
and
i
was
too
inflamed
and
weakened
to
conceal
the
state
of
my
mind
i
was
feebly
angry
because
of
the
irritation
of
dressing
and
particularly
of
the
struggle
to
put
on
my
trousers
without
being
able
to
see
my
legs
i
was
staggering
about
and
once
i
had
fallen
over
a
chair
and
i
had
upset
the
jar
of
michaelmas
daisies
i
must
have
been
a
detestable
spectacle
i
ll
go
back
to
bed
said
i
if
i
may
have
a
word
with
miss
beatrice
i
ve
got
something
to
say
to
her
that
s
why
i
m
my
point
was
conceded
but
there
were
long
delays
whether
the
household
had
my
ultimatum
or
whether
she
told
beatrice
directly
i
do
not
know
and
what
lady
osprey
can
have
made
of
it
in
the
former
case
i
don
t
imagine
at
last
beatrice
came
and
stood
by
my
bedside
well
she
said
all
i
want
to
say
i
said
with
the
querulous
note
of
a
misunderstood
child
is
that
i
can
t
take
this
as
final
i
want
to
see
you
and
talk
when
i
m
better
and
write
i
can
t
do
anything
now
i
can
t
i
was
overtaken
with
and
began
to
snivel
i
can
t
rest
you
see
i
can
t
do
she
sat
down
beside
me
again
and
spoke
softly
i
promise
i
will
talk
it
all
over
with
you
again
when
you
are
well
i
promise
i
will
meet
you
somewhere
so
that
we
can
talk
you
can
t
talk
now
i
asked
you
not
to
talk
now
all
you
want
to
know
you
shall
know
will
that
do
i
d
like
to
know
she
looked
round
to
see
the
door
was
closed
stood
up
and
went
to
it
then
she
crouched
beside
me
and
began
whispering
very
softly
and
rapidly
with
her
face
close
to
me
dear
she
said
i
love
you
if
it
will
make
you
happy
to
marry
me
i
will
marry
you
i
was
in
a
mood
just
now
a
stupid
inconsiderate
mood
of
course
i
will
marry
you
you
are
my
prince
my
king
women
are
such
things
of
mood
or
i
would
have
behaved
differently
we
say
no
when
we
mean
yes
and
fly
into
crises
so
now
yes
yes
yes
i
will
i
can
t
even
kiss
you
give
me
your
hand
to
kiss
that
understand
i
am
yours
do
you
understand
i
am
yours
just
as
if
we
had
been
married
fifty
years
your
wife
beatrice
is
that
enough
now
now
will
you
rest
yes
i
said
but
why
there
are
complications
there
are
difficulties
when
you
are
better
you
will
be
able
to
understand
them
but
now
they
don
t
matter
only
you
know
this
must
be
secret
for
a
time
absolutely
secret
between
us
will
you
promise
that
yes
i
said
i
understand
i
wish
i
could
kiss
she
laid
her
head
down
beside
mine
for
a
moment
and
then
she
kissed
my
hand
i
don
t
care
what
difficulties
there
are
i
said
and
i
shut
my
eyes
vii
but
i
was
only
beginning
to
gauge
the
unaccountable
elements
in
beatrice
for
a
week
after
my
return
to
lady
grove
i
had
no
sign
of
her
and
then
she
called
with
lady
osprey
and
brought
a
huge
bunch
of
perennial
sunflowers
and
michaelmas
daisies
just
the
old
flowers
there
were
in
your
room
said
my
aunt
with
a
relentless
eye
on
me
i
didn
t
get
any
talk
alone
with
beatrice
then
and
she
took
occasion
to
tell
us
she
was
going
to
london
for
some
indefinite
number
of
weeks
i
couldn
t
even
pledge
her
to
write
to
me
and
when
she
did
it
was
a
brief
enigmatical
friendly
letter
with
not
a
word
of
the
reality
between
us
i
wrote
back
a
love
letter
my
first
love
letter
and
she
made
no
reply
for
eight
days
then
came
a
scrawl
i
can
t
write
letters
wait
till
we
can
talk
are
you
better
i
think
the
reader
would
be
amused
if
he
could
see
the
papers
on
my
desk
as
i
write
all
this
the
mangled
and
disfigured
pages
the
experimental
arrangements
of
notes
the
sheets
of
suggestions
balanced
in
constellations
the
blottesque
intellectual
battlegrounds
over
which
i
have
been
fighting
i
find
this
account
of
my
relations
to
beatrice
quite
the
most
difficult
part
of
my
story
to
write
i
happen
to
be
a
very
person
i
forget
my
moods
and
this
was
so
much
an
affair
of
moods
and
even
such
moods
and
emotions
as
i
recall
are
very
difficult
to
convey
to
me
it
is
about
as
difficult
as
describing
a
taste
or
a
scent
then
the
objective
story
is
made
up
of
little
things
that
are
difficult
to
set
in
a
proper
order
and
love
in
an
hysterical
passion
now
high
now
low
now
exalted
and
now
intensely
physical
no
one
has
ever
yet
dared
to
tell
a
love
story
completely
its
alternations
its
comings
and
goings
its
debased
moments
its
hate
the
love
stories
we
tell
tell
only
the
net
consequence
the
ruling
effect
how
can
i
rescue
from
the
past
now
the
mystical
quality
of
beatrice
my
intense
longing
for
her
the
overwhelming
irrational
formless
desire
how
can
i
explain
how
intimately
that
worship
mingled
with
a
high
impatient
resolve
to
make
her
mine
to
take
her
by
strength
and
courage
to
do
my
loving
in
a
violent
heroic
manner
and
then
the
doubts
the
puzzled
arrest
at
the
fact
of
her
fluctuations
at
her
refusal
to
marry
me
at
the
fact
that
even
when
at
last
she
returned
to
bedley
corner
she
seemed
to
evade
me
that
exasperated
me
and
perplexed
me
beyond
measure
i
felt
that
it
was
treachery
i
thought
of
every
conceivable
explanation
and
the
most
exalted
and
romantic
confidence
in
her
did
not
simply
alternate
but
mingled
with
the
basest
misgivings
and
into
the
tangle
of
memories
comes
the
figure
of
carnaby
coming
out
slowly
from
the
background
to
a
position
of
significance
as
an
influence
as
a
predominant
strand
in
the
nets
that
kept
us
apart
as
a
rival
what
were
the
forces
that
pulled
her
away
from
me
when
it
was
so
clearly
manifest
she
loved
me
did
she
think
of
marrying
him
had
i
invaded
some
scheme
it
was
evident
he
did
not
like
me
that
in
some
way
i
spoilt
the
world
for
him
she
returned
to
bedley
corner
and
for
some
weeks
she
was
flitting
about
me
and
never
once
could
i
have
talk
with
her
alone
when
she
came
to
my
sheds
carnaby
was
always
with
her
jealously
observant
why
the
devil
couldn
t
she
send
him
about
his
business
the
days
slipped
by
and
my
anger
gathered
all
this
mingles
with
the
making
of
lord
roberts
i
had
resolved
upon
that
one
night
as
i
lay
awake
at
bedley
corner
i
got
it
planned
out
before
the
bandages
were
off
my
face
i
conceived
this
second
navigable
balloon
in
a
grandiose
manner
it
was
to
be
a
second
lord
roberts
a
only
more
so
it
was
to
be
three
times
as
big
large
enough
to
carry
three
men
and
it
was
to
be
an
altogether
triumphant
vindication
of
my
claims
upon
the
air
the
framework
was
to
be
hollow
like
a
bird
s
bones
airtight
and
the
air
pumped
in
or
out
and
the
weight
of
fuel
i
carried
changed
i
talked
much
and
boasted
to
cothope
whom
i
suspected
of
scepticisms
about
this
new
type
of
what
it
would
do
and
it
progressed
slowly
it
progressed
slowly
because
i
was
restless
and
uncertain
at
times
i
would
go
away
to
london
to
snatch
some
chance
of
seeing
beatrice
there
at
times
nothing
but
a
day
of
gliding
and
hard
and
dangerous
exercise
would
satisfy
me
and
now
in
the
newspapers
in
conversation
in
everything
about
me
arose
a
new
invader
of
my
mental
states
something
was
happening
to
the
great
schemes
of
my
uncle
s
affairs
people
were
beginning
to
doubt
to
question
it
was
the
first
quiver
of
his
tremendous
insecurity
the
first
wobble
of
that
gigantic
credit
top
he
had
kept
spinning
so
long
there
were
comings
and
goings
november
and
december
slipped
by
i
had
two
unsatisfactory
meetings
with
beatrice
meetings
that
had
no
privacy
in
which
we
said
things
of
the
sort
that
need
atmosphere
baldly
and
furtively
i
wrote
to
her
several
times
and
she
wrote
back
notes
that
i
would
sometimes
respond
to
altogether
sometimes
condemn
as
insincere
evasions
you
don
t
understand
i
can
t
just
now
explain
be
patient
with
me
leave
things
a
little
while
to
she
wrote
i
would
talk
aloud
to
these
notes
and
wrangle
over
them
in
my
workroom
while
the
plans
of
lord
roberts
b
waited
you
don
t
give
me
a
chance
i
would
say
why
don
t
you
let
me
know
the
secret
that
s
what
i
m
for
to
settle
difficulties
to
tell
difficulties
to
and
at
last
i
could
hold
out
no
longer
against
these
accumulating
pressures
i
took
an
arrogant
outrageous
line
that
left
her
no
loopholes
i
behaved
as
though
we
were
living
in
a
melodrama
you
must
come
and
talk
to
me
i
wrote
or
i
will
come
and
take
you
i
want
you
and
the
time
runs
we
met
in
a
ride
in
the
upper
plantations
it
must
have
been
early
in
january
for
there
was
snow
on
the
ground
and
on
the
branches
of
the
trees
we
walked
to
and
fro
for
an
hour
or
more
and
from
the
first
i
pitched
the
key
high
in
romance
and
made
understandings
impossible
it
was
our
worst
time
together
i
boasted
like
an
actor
and
she
i
know
not
why
was
tired
and
spiritless
now
i
think
over
that
talk
in
the
light
of
all
that
has
happened
since
i
can
imagine
how
she
came
to
me
full
of
a
human
appeal
i
was
too
foolish
to
let
her
make
i
don
t
know
i
confess
i
have
never
completely
understood
beatrice
i
confess
i
am
still
perplexed
at
many
things
she
said
and
did
that
afternoon
anyhow
i
was
impossible
i
posed
and
scolded
i
was
i
said
it
for
taking
the
universe
by
the
throat
if
it
was
only
that
she
said
but
though
i
heard
i
did
not
heed
her
at
last
she
gave
way
to
me
and
talked
no
more
instead
she
looked
at
me
as
a
thing
beyond
her
controlling
but
none
the
less
interesting
much
as
she
had
looked
at
me
from
behind
the
skirts
of
lady
drew
in
the
warren
when
we
were
children
together
once
even
i
thought
she
smiled
faintly
what
are
the
difficulties
i
cried
there
s
no
difficulty
i
will
not
overcome
for
you
do
your
people
think
i
m
no
equal
for
you
who
says
it
my
dear
tell
me
to
win
a
title
i
ll
do
it
in
five
years
here
am
i
just
grown
a
man
at
the
sight
of
you
i
have
wanted
something
to
fight
for
let
me
fight
for
you
i
m
rich
without
intending
it
let
me
mean
it
give
me
an
honourable
excuse
for
it
and
i
ll
put
all
this
rotten
old
warren
of
england
at
your
feet
i
said
such
things
as
that
i
write
them
down
here
in
all
their
resounding
base
pride
i
said
these
empty
and
foolish
things
and
they
are
part
of
me
why
should
i
still
cling
to
pride
and
be
ashamed
i
shouted
her
down
i
passed
from
such
megalomania
to
petty
accusations
you
think
carnaby
is
a
better
man
than
i
i
said
no
she
cried
stung
to
speech
no
you
think
we
re
unsubstantial
you
ve
listened
to
all
these
rumours
boom
has
started
because
we
talked
of
a
newspaper
of
our
own
when
you
are
with
me
you
know
i
m
a
man
when
you
get
away
from
me
you
think
i
m
a
cheat
and
a
cad
there
s
not
a
word
of
truth
in
the
things
they
say
about
us
i
ve
been
slack
i
ve
left
things
but
we
have
only
to
exert
ourselves
you
do
not
know
how
wide
and
far
we
have
spread
our
nets
even
now
we
have
a
coup
an
expedition
in
hand
it
will
put
us
on
a
her
eyes
asked
mutely
and
asked
in
vain
that
i
would
cease
to
boast
of
the
very
qualities
she
admired
in
me
in
the
night
i
could
not
sleep
for
thinking
of
that
talk
and
the
vulgar
things
i
had
said
in
it
i
could
not
understand
the
drift
my
mind
had
taken
i
was
acutely
disgusted
and
my
unwonted
doubts
about
myself
spread
from
a
merely
personal
discontent
to
our
financial
position
it
was
all
very
well
to
talk
as
i
had
done
of
wealth
and
power
and
peerages
but
what
did
i
know
nowadays
of
my
uncle
s
position
suppose
in
the
midst
of
such
boasting
and
confidence
there
came
some
turn
i
did
not
suspect
some
rottenness
he
had
concealed
from
me
i
resolved
i
had
been
playing
with
aeronautics
long
enough
that
next
morning
i
would
go
to
him
and
have
things
clear
between
us
i
caught
an
early
train
and
went
up
to
the
hardingham
i
went
up
to
the
hardingham
through
a
dense
london
fog
to
see
how
things
really
stood
before
i
had
talked
to
my
uncle
for
ten
minutes
i
felt
like
a
man
who
has
just
awakened
in
a
bleak
inhospitable
room
out
of
a
grandiose
dream
chapter
the
fourth
how
i
stole
the
heaps
of
quap
from
mordet
island
i
we
got
to
make
a
fight
for
it
said
my
uncle
we
got
to
face
the
music
i
remember
that
even
at
the
sight
of
him
i
had
a
sense
of
impending
calamity
he
sat
under
the
electric
light
with
the
shadow
of
his
hair
making
bars
down
his
face
he
looked
shrunken
and
as
though
his
skin
had
suddenly
got
loose
and
yellow
the
decorations
of
the
room
seemed
to
have
lost
freshness
and
outside
the
blinds
were
up
there
was
not
so
much
fog
as
a
dun
darkness
one
saw
the
dingy
outlines
of
the
chimneys
opposite
quite
distinctly
and
then
a
sky
of
such
brown
as
only
london
can
display
i
saw
a
placard
i
said
more
that
s
boom
he
said
boom
and
his
damned
newspapers
he
s
trying
to
fight
me
down
ever
since
i
offered
to
buy
the
daily
decorator
he
s
been
at
me
and
he
thinks
consolidating
do
ut
cut
down
the
ads
he
wants
everything
damn
him
he
s
got
no
sense
of
dealing
i
d
like
to
bash
his
face
well
i
said
what
s
to
be
done
keep
going
said
my
uncle
i
ll
smash
boom
yet
he
said
with
sudden
savagery
nothing
else
i
asked
we
got
to
keep
going
there
s
a
scare
on
did
you
notice
the
rooms
half
the
people
out
there
this
morning
are
reporters
and
if
i
talk
they
touch
it
up
they
didn
t
used
to
touch
things
up
now
they
put
in
character
touches
insulting
you
don
t
know
what
journalism
s
coming
to
it
s
all
boom
s
he
cursed
lord
boom
with
considerable
imaginative
vigour
well
said
i
what
can
he
do
shove
us
up
against
time
george
make
money
tight
for
us

handling
a
lot
of
money
and
he
tightens
us
we
re
sound
oh

re
sound
george
trust
me
for
that
but
all
the
same
there
s
such
a
lot
of
imagination
in
these
things
we
re
sound
enough
that
s
not
he
blew
damn
boom
he
said
and
his
eyes
over
his
glasses
met
mine
defiantly

bitstop
expenditure

he
shouted
me

for

waved
a
fist
as
if
to
hit
his
inkpot
and
controlled
himself
with
difficulty
he
spoke
at
last
in
a
reasonable
voice
if
i
did
he
said
he
d
kick
up
a
fuss
it
s
no
good
even
if
i
wanted
to
everybody
s
watching
the
place
if
i
was
to
stop
building
we
d
be
down

an
idea

workmen
a
sight
too
well
no

goes
on
until
we

under

began
to
ask
questions
and
irritated
him
instantly
oh
dash
these
explanations
george
he
cried
you
only
make
things
look
rottener
than
they
are
it
s
your
way
it
isn
t
a
case
of
figures
we
re
all
right
there
s
only
one
thing
we
got
to
yes
show
value
george
that
s
where
this
quap
comes
in
that
s
why
i
fell
in
so
readily
with
what
you
brought
to
me
week
before
last
here
we
are
we
got
our
option
on
the
perfect
filament
and
all
we
want
s
canadium
nobody
knows
there
s
more
canadium
in
the
world
than
will
go
on
the
edge
of
a
sixpence
except
me
and
you
nobody
has
an
idee
the
perfect
filament
s
more
than
just
a
bit
of
theorising
fifty
tons
of
quap
and
we
d
turn
that
bit
of
theorising
into
something
we
d
make
the
lamp
trade
sit
on
its
tail
and
howl
we
d
put
ediswan
and
all
of
em
into
a
parcel
without
last
year
s
trousers
and
a
hat
and
swap
em
off
for
a
pot
of
geraniums
see
we
d
do
it
through
business
organisations
and
there
you
are
see
capern
s
patent
filament
the
ideal
and
the
real
george
we
ll
do
it
we
ll
bring
it
off
and
then
we
ll
give
such
a
facer
to
boom
he
ll
think
for
fifty
years
he
s
laying
up
for
our
london
and
african
meeting
let
him
he
can
turn
the
whole
paper
on
to
us
he
says
the
business
organisations
shares
aren
t
worth
and
we
quote
em
at
well
here
we
are
gettin
ready
for
him
loading
our
his
pose
was
triumphant
yes
i
said
that
s
all
right
but
i
can
t
help
thinking
where
should
we
be
if
we
hadn
t
just
by
accident
got
capern
s
perfect
filament
because
you
know
it
was
an
accident
my
buying
up
he
crumpled
up
his
nose
into
an
expression
of
impatient
distaste
at
my
unreasonableness
and
after
all
the
meeting
s
in
june
and
you
haven
t
begun
to
get
the
quap
after
all
we
ve
still
got
to
load
our
they
start
on
have
they
got
the
brig
they
ve
got
a
i
doubted
safe
as
a
bank
he
said
more
i
see
of
that
man
the
more
i
like
him
all
i
wish
is
we
d
got
a
steamer
instead
of
a
sailing
and
i
went
on
you
seem
to
overlook
what
used
to
weigh
with
us
a
bit
this
canadium
side
of
the
business
and
the
capern
chance
has
rushed
you
off
your
legs
after
all
it
s
stealing
and
in
its
way
an
international
outrage
they
ve
got
two
gunboats
on
the
i
jumped
up
and
went
and
stared
out
at
the
fog
and
by
jove
it
s
about
our
only
chance
i
didn
t
i
turned
on
him
i
ve
been
up
in
the
air
i
said
heaven
knows
where
i
haven
t
been
and
here
s
our
only
chance
and
you
give
it
to
that
adventurous
lunatic
to
play
in
his
own
way
in
a
brig
well
you
had
a
voice
i
wish
i
d
been
in
this
before
we
ought
to
have
run
out
a
steamer
to
lagos
or
one
of
those
west
coast
places
and
done
it
from
there
fancy
a
brig
in
the
channel
at
this
time
of
year
if
it
blows
southwest
i
dessay
you
d
have
shoved
it
george
still
you
know
george
i
believe
in
yes
i
said
yes
i
believe
in
him
too
in
a
way
still
we
took
up
a
telegram
that
was
lying
on
his
desk
and
opened
it
his
face
became
a
livid
yellow
he
put
the
flimsy
paper
down
with
a
slow
reluctant
movement
and
took
off
his
glasses
george
he
said
the
luck
s
against
what
he
grimaced
with
his
mouth
in
the
queerest
way
at
the
telegram
i
took
it
up
and
read

the
leg
gordon
nasmyth
what
price
mordet
now
for
a
moment
neither
of
us
spoke
that
s
all
right
i
said
at
last
eh
said
my
uncle
i
m
going
i
ll
get
that
quap
or
ii
i
had
a
ridiculous
persuasion
that
i
was
saving
the
i
m
going
i
said
quite
consciously
and
dramatically
i
saw
the
whole
affair
how
shall
i
put
it
in
american
colours
i
sat
down
beside
him
give
me
all
the
data
you
ve
got
i
said
and
i
ll
pull
this
thing
but
nobody
knows
exactly
where
nasmyth
does
and
he
ll
tell
he
s
been
very
close
said
my
uncle
and
regarded
me
he
ll
tell
me
all
right
now
he
s
he
thought
i
believe
he
george
he
said
if
you
pull
this
thing
off
once
or
twice
before
you
ve
stepped
in
with
that
sort
of
woosh
of
yours
he
left
the
sentence
unfinished
give
me
that
i
said
and
tell
me
all
you
know
where
s
the
ship
where
s
pollack
and
where
s
that
telegram
from
if
that
quap
s
to
be
got
i
ll
get
it
or
bust
if
you
ll
hold
on
here
until
i
get
back
with
and
so
it
was
i
jumped
into
the
wildest
adventure
of
my
life
i
requisitioned
my
uncle
s
best
car
forthwith
i
went
down
that
night
to
the
place
of
despatch
named
on
nasmyth
s
telegram
bampton
oxon
routed
him
out
with
a
little
trouble
from
that
centre
made
things
right
with
him
and
got
his
explicit
directions
and
i
was
inspecting
the
maud
mary
with
young
pollack
his
cousin
and
aide
the
following
afternoon
she
was
rather
a
shock
to
me
and
not
at
all
in
my
style
a
beast
of
a
brig
inured
to
the
potato
trade
and
she
reeked
from
end
to
end
with
the
faint
subtle
smell
of
raw
potatoes
so
that
it
prevailed
even
over
the
temporary
smell
of
new
paint
she
was
a
beast
of
a
brig
all
hold
and
dirty
framework
and
they
had
ballasted
her
with
old
iron
and
old
rails
and
iron
sleepers
and
got
a
miscellaneous
lot
of
spades
and
iron
wheelbarrows
against
the
loading
of
the
quap
i
thought
her
over
with
pollack
one
of
those
tall
blond
young
men
who
smoke
pipes
and
don
t
help
much
and
then
by
myself
and
as
a
result
i
did
my
best
to
sweep
gravesend
clean
of
wheeling
planks
and
got
in
as
much
cord
and
small
rope
as
i
could
for
lashing
i
had
an
idea
we
might
need
to
run
up
a
jetty
in
addition
to
much
ballast
she
held
remotely
hidden
in
a
sort
of
inadvertent
way
a
certain
number
of
ambiguous
cases
which
i
didn
t
examine
but
which
i
gathered
were
a
provision
against
the
need
of
a
trade
the
captain
was
a
most
extraordinary
creature
under
the
impression
we
were
after
copper
ore
he
was
a
roumanian
jew
with
twitching
excitable
features
who
had
made
his
way
to
a
certificate
after
some
preliminary
naval
experiences
in
the
black
sea
the
mate
was
an
essex
man
of
impenetrable
reserve
the
crew
were
astoundingly
and
destitute
and
dirty
most
of
them
youths
unwashed
out
of
colliers
one
the
cook
was
a
mulatto
and
one
the
fellow
of
them
all
was
a
breton
there
was
some
subterfuge
about
our
position
on
board
i
forget
the
particulars
now
i
was
called
the
supercargo
and
pollack
was
the
steward
this
added
to
the
piratical
flavour
that
insufficient
funds
and
s
original
genius
had
already
given
the
enterprise
those
two
days
of
bustle
at
gravesend
under
dingy
skies
in
narrow
dirty
streets
were
a
new
experience
for
me
it
is
like
nothing
else
in
my
life
i
realised
that
i
was
a
modern
and
a
civilised
man
i
found
the
food
filthy
and
the
coffee
horrible
the
whole
town
stank
in
my
nostrils
the
landlord
of
the
good
intent
on
the
quay
had
a
quarrel
with
us
before
i
could
get
even
a
hot
bath
and
the
bedroom
i
slept
in
was
infested
by
a
quantity
of
exotic
but
voracious
flat
parasites
called
locally
bugs
in
the
walls
in
the
woodwork
everywhere
i
fought
them
with
insect
powder
and
found
them
comatose
in
the
morning
i
was
dipping
down
into
the
dingy
underworld
of
the
contemporary
state
and
i
liked
it
no
better
than
i
did
my
first
dip
into
it
when
i
stayed
with
my
uncle
nicodemus
frapp
at
the
bakery
at
chatham
where
we
had
to
deal
with
cockroaches
of
a
smaller
darker
variety
and
also
with
bugs
of
sorts
let
me
confess
that
through
all
this
time
before
we
started
i
was
immensely
and
that
beatrice
played
the
part
of
audience
in
my
imagination
throughout
i
was
as
i
say
saving
the
situation
and
i
was
acutely
aware
of
that
the
evening
before
we
sailed
instead
of
revising
our
as
i
had
intended
i
took
the
car
and
ran
across
country
to
lady
grove
to
tell
my
aunt
of
the
journey
i
was
making
dress
and
astonish
lady
osprey
by
an
after
dinner
call
the
two
ladies
were
at
home
and
alone
beside
a
big
fire
that
seemed
wonderfully
cheerful
after
the
winter
night
i
remember
the
effect
of
the
little
parlour
in
which
they
sat
as
very
bright
and
domestic
lady
osprey
in
a
costume
of
mauve
and
lace
sat
on
a
chintz
sofa
and
played
an
elaborately
patience
by
the
light
of
a
tall
shaded
lamp
beatrice
in
a
whiteness
that
showed
her
throat
smoked
a
cigarette
in
an
armchair
and
read
with
a
lamp
at
her
elbow
the
room
was
and
about
those
two
bright
centres
of
light
were
warm
dark
shadow
in
which
a
circular
mirror
shone
like
a
pool
of
brown
water
i
carried
off
my
raid
by
behaving
like
a
slave
of
etiquette
there
were
moments
when
i
think
i
really
made
lady
osprey
believe
that
my
call
was
an
unavoidable
necessity
that
it
would
have
been
negligent
of
me
not
to
call
just
how
and
when
i
did
but
at
the
best
those
were
transitory
moments
they
received
me
with
disciplined
amazement
lady
osprey
was
interested
in
my
face
and
scrutinised
the
scar
beatrice
stood
behind
her
solicitude
our
eyes
met
and
in
hers
i
could
see
startled
interrogations
i
m
going
i
said
to
the
west
coast
of
they
asked
questions
but
it
suited
my
mood
to
be
vague
we
ve
interests
there
it
is
urgent
i
should
go
i
don
t
know
when
i
may
after
that
i
perceived
beatrice
surveyed
me
steadily
the
conversation
was
rather
difficult
i
embarked
upon
lengthy
thanks
for
their
kindness
to
me
after
my
accident
i
tried
to
understand
lady
osprey
s
game
of
patience
but
it
didn
t
appear
that
lady
osprey
was
anxious
for
me
to
understand
her
patience
i
came
to
the
verge
of
taking
my
leave
you
needn
t
go
yet
said
beatrice
abruptly
she
walked
across
to
the
piano
took
a
pile
of
music
from
the
cabinet
near
surveyed
lady
osprey
s
back
and
with
a
gesture
to
me
dropped
it
all
deliberately
on
to
the
floor
must
talk
she
said
kneeling
close
to
me
as
i
helped
her
to
pick
it
up
turn
my
pages
at
the
i
can
t
read
turn
my
presently
we
were
at
the
piano
and
beatrice
was
playing
with
noisy
inaccuracy
she
glanced
over
her
shoulder
and
lady
osprey
had
resumed
her
patience
the
old
lady
was
very
pink
and
appeared
to
be
absorbed
in
some
attempt
to
cheat
herself
without
our
observing
it
isn
t
west
africa
a
vile
climate
are
you
going
to
live
there
why
are
you
going
beatrice
asked
these
questions
in
a
low
voice
and
gave
me
no
chance
to
answer
then
taking
a
rhythm
from
the
music
before
her
she
said
at
the
back
of
the
house
is
a
garden
a
door
in
the
wall
on
the
lane
understand
i
turned
over
the
pages
without
any
effect
on
her
playing
when
i
asked
she
dealt
in
chords
i
wish
i
could
play
this
she
said
she
gave
her
attention
to
the
music
for
a
time
you
may
have
to
i
ll
she
brought
her
playing
to
an
end
by
as
school
boys
say
stashing
it
i
can
t
play
she
said
standing
up
and
meeting
my
eyes
i
wanted
to
give
you
a
parting
was
that
wagner
beatrice
asked
lady
osprey
looking
up
from
her
cards
it
sounded
very
i
took
my
leave
i
had
a
curious
twinge
of
conscience
as
i
parted
from
lady
osprey
either
a
first
intimation
of
or
my
inexperience
in
romantic
affairs
was
to
blame
but
i
felt
a
very
distinct
objection
to
the
prospect
of
invading
this
good
lady
s
premises
from
the
garden
door
i
motored
up
to
the
pavilion
found
cothope
reading
in
bed
told
him
for
the
first
time
of
west
africa
spent
an
hour
with
him
in
settling
all
the
outstanding
details
of
lord
roberts
b
and
left
that
in
his
hands
to
finish
against
my
return
i
sent
the
motor
back
to
lady
grove
and
still
wearing
my
fur
coat
for
the
january
night
was
damp
and
bitterly
cold
walked
to
bedley
corner
i
found
the
lane
to
the
back
of
the
dower
house
without
any
difficulty
and
was
at
the
door
in
the
wall
with
ten
minutes
to
spare
i
lit
a
cigar
and
fell
to
walking
up
and
down
this
queer
flavour
of
intrigue
this
nocturnal
business
had
taken
me
by
surprise
and
changed
my
mental
altitudes
i
was
startled
out
of
my
egotistical
pose
and
thinking
intently
of
beatrice
of
that
elfin
quality
in
her
that
always
pleased
me
that
always
took
me
by
surprise
that
had
made
her
for
example
so
instantly
conceive
this
meeting
she
came
within
a
minute
of
midnight
the
door
opened
softly
and
she
appeared
a
short
grey
figure
in
a
of
sheepskin
bareheaded
to
the
cold
drizzle
she
flitted
up
to
me
and
her
eyes
were
shadows
in
her
dusky
face
why
are
you
going
to
west
africa
she
asked
at
once
business
crisis
i
have
to
you
re
not
going
you
re
coming
back
three
or
four
months
i
said
at
then
it
s
nothing
to
do
with
me
nothing
i
said
why
should
it
have
oh
that
s
all
right
one
never
knows
what
people
think
or
what
people
she
took
me
by
the
arm
let
s
go
for
a
walk
she
said
i
looked
about
me
at
darkness
and
rain
that
s
all
right
she
laughed
we
can
go
along
the
lane
and
into
the
old
woking
road
do
you
mind
of
course
you
don
t
my
head
it
doesn
t
matter
one
never
meets
how
do
you
know
i
ve
wandered
like
this
before
of
course
did
you
think
she
nodded
her
head
back
at
her
home
that
s
all
no
by
jove
i
cried
it
s
manifest
it
isn
she
took
my
arm
and
turned
me
down
the
lane
night
s
my
time
she
said
by
my
side
there
s
a
touch
of
the
werewolf
in
my
blood
one
never
knows
in
these
old
families
i
ve
wondered
often
here
we
are
anyhow
alone
in
the
world
just
darkness
and
cold
and
a
sky
of
clouds
and
wet
and
we
together
i
like
the
wet
on
my
face
and
hair
don
t
you
when
do
you
sail
i
told
her
oh
well
there
s
no
now
you
and
i
she
stopped
and
confronted
me
you
don
t
say
a
word
except
to
answer
no
i
said
last
time
you
did
all
the
like
a
fool
now
we
looked
at
each
other
s
two
dim
faces
you
re
glad
to
be
here
i
m
glad
i
m
beginning
to
be
it
s
more
than
she
put
her
hands
on
my
shoulders
and
drew
me
down
to
kiss
her
ah
she
said
and
for
a
moment
or
so
we
just
clung
to
one
another
that
s
all
she
said
releasing
herself
what
bundles
of
clothes
we
are
i
felt
we
should
kiss
some
day
again
always
the
last
time
was
ages
among
the
fern
among
the
bracken
you
remember
and
your
lips
were
cold
were
mine
the
same
lips
after
so
long
after
so
much
and
now
let
s
trudge
through
this
world
together
for
a
time
yes
let
me
take
your
arm
just
trudge
see
hold
tight
to
me
because
i
know
the
way
and
don
t
talk
don
t
talk
unless
you
want
to
talk
let
me
tell
you
things
you
see
dear
the
whole
world
is
blotted
out
it
s
dead
and
gone
and
we
re
in
this
place
this
dark
wild
place
we
re
dead
or
all
the
world
is
dead
no
we
re
dead
no
one
can
see
us
we
re
shadows
we
ve
got
out
of
our
positions
out
of
our
bodies
and
together
that
s
the
good
thing
of
it
together
but
that
s
why
the
world
can
t
see
us
and
why
we
hardly
see
the
world
sssh
is
it
all
right
it
s
all
right
i
said
we
stumbled
along
for
a
time
in
a
close
silence
we
passed
a
window
the
silly
world
she
said
the
silly
world
it
eats
and
sleeps
if
the
wet
didn
t
patter
so
from
the
trees
we
d
hear
it
snoring
it
s
dreaming
such
stupid
things
stupid
judgments
it
doesn
t
know
we
are
passing
we
two
free
of
it
clear
of
it
you
and
i
we
pressed
against
each
other
reassuringly
i
m
glad
we
re
dead
she
whispered
i
m
glad
we
re
dead
i
was
tired
of
it
dear
i
was
so
tired
of
it
dear
and
so
she
stopped
abruptly
we
splashed
through
a
string
of
puddles
i
began
to
remember
things
i
had
meant
to
say
look
here
i
cried
i
want
to
help
you
beyond
measure
you
are
entangled
what
is
the
trouble
i
asked
you
to
marry
me
you
said
you
would
but
there
s
my
thoughts
sounded
clumsy
as
i
said
them
is
it
something
about
my
position
or
is
it
something
perhaps
about
some
other
man
there
was
an
immense
assenting
silence
you
ve
puzzled
me
so
at
first
i
mean
quite
early
i
thought
you
meant
to
make
me
marry
i
and
then
she
said
after
a
long
pause
i
can
t
explain
no
i
can
t
explain
i
love
you
but
explanations
my
dear
here
we
are
in
the
world
alone
and
the
world
doesn
t
matter
nothing
matters
here
i
am
in
the
cold
with
you
and
my
bed
away
there
deserted
i
d
tell
you
i
will
tell
you
when
things
enable
me
to
tell
you
and
soon
enough
they
will
but
i
won
t
i
won
she
left
my
side
and
went
in
front
of
me
she
turned
upon
me
look
here
she
said
i
insist
upon
your
being
dead
do
you
understand
i
m
not
joking
you
and
i
are
out
of
life
it
s
our
time
together
there
may
be
other
times
but
this
we
won
t
spoil
we
re
in
hades
if
you
like
where
there
s
nothing
to
hide
and
nothing
to
tell
no
bodies
even
no
bothers
we
loved
each
other
down
there
and
were
kept
apart
but
now
it
doesn
t
matter
it
s
over
if
you
won
t
agree
to
that
i
will
go
i
wanted
i
began
i
know
oh
my
dear
if
you
d
only
understand
i
understand
if
you
d
only
not
care
and
love
me
i
do
love
you
i
said
then
love
me
she
answered
and
leave
all
the
things
that
bother
you
love
me
here
i
am
but
no
she
said
well
have
your
so
she
carried
her
point
and
we
wandered
into
the
night
together
and
beatrice
talked
to
me
of
love
i
d
never
heard
a
woman
before
in
all
my
life
who
could
talk
of
love
who
could
lay
bare
and
develop
and
touch
with
imagination
all
that
mass
of
fine
emotion
every
woman
it
may
be
hides
she
had
read
of
love
she
had
thought
of
love
a
thousand
sweet
lyrics
had
sounded
through
her
brain
and
left
fine
fragments
in
her
memory
she
poured
it
out
all
of
it
shamelessly
skilfully
for
me
i
can
not
give
any
sense
of
that
talk
i
can
not
even
tell
how
much
of
the
delight
of
it
was
the
magic
of
her
voice
the
glow
of
her
near
presence
and
always
we
walked
swathed
warmly
through
a
chilly
air
along
dim
interminable
greasy
roads
with
never
a
soul
abroad
it
seemed
to
us
never
a
beast
in
the
fields
why
do
people
love
each
other
i
said
why
not
but
why
do
i
love
you
why
is
your
voice
better
than
any
voice
your
face
sweeter
than
any
face
and
why
do
i
love
you
she
asked
not
only
what
is
fine
in
you
but
what
isn
t
why
do
i
love
your
dullness
your
arrogance
for
i
do
to
night
i
love
the
very
raindrops
on
the
fur
of
your
coat
so
we
talked
and
at
last
very
wet
still
glowing
but
a
little
tired
we
parted
at
the
garden
door
we
had
been
wandering
for
two
hours
in
our
strange
irrational
community
of
happiness
and
all
the
world
about
us
and
particularly
lady
osprey
and
her
household
had
been
asleep
and
dreaming
of
anything
rather
than
beatrice
in
the
night
and
rain
she
stood
in
the
doorway
a
muffled
figure
with
eyes
that
glowed
come
back
she
whispered
i
shall
wait
for
she
hesitated
she
touched
the
lapel
of
my
coat
i
love
you
now
she
said
and
lifted
her
face
to
mine
i
held
her
to
me
and
was
atremble
from
top
to
toe
o
god
i
cried
and
i
must
go
she
slipped
from
my
arms
and
paused
regarding
me
for
an
instant
the
world
seemed
full
of
fantastic
possibilities
yes
go
she
said
and
vanished
and
slammed
the
door
upon
me
leaving
me
alone
like
a
man
new
fallen
from
fairyland
in
the
black
darkness
of
the
night
iii
that
expedition
to
mordet
island
stands
apart
from
all
the
rest
of
my
life
detached
a
piece
by
itself
with
an
atmosphere
of
its
own
it
would
i
suppose
make
a
book
by
itself
it
has
made
a
fairly
voluminous
official
report
but
so
far
as
this
novel
of
mine
goes
it
is
merely
an
episode
a
contributory
experience
and
i
mean
to
keep
it
at
that
vile
weather
an
impatient
fretting
against
unbearable
slowness
and
delay
sea
sickness
general
discomfort
and
humiliating
self
revelation
are
the
master
values
of
these
memories
i
was
sick
all
through
the
journey
out
i
don
t
know
why
it
was
the
only
time
i
was
ever
and
i
have
seen
some
pretty
bad
weather
since
i
became
a
but
that
phantom
smell
of
potatoes
was
peculiarly
vile
to
me
coming
back
on
the
brig
we
were
all
ill
every
one
of
us
so
soon
as
we
got
to
sea
poisoned
i
firmly
believe
by
quap
on
the
way
out
most
of
the
others
recovered
in
a
few
days
but
the
stuffiness
below
the
coarse
food
the
cramped
dirty
accommodation
kept
me
if
not
actually
in
a
state
of
acute
physical
wretchedness
the
whole
time
the
ship
abounded
in
cockroaches
and
more
intimate
vermin
i
was
cold
all
the
time
until
after
we
passed
cape
verde
then
i
became
steamily
hot
i
had
been
too
preoccupied
with
beatrice
and
my
keen
desire
to
get
the
maud
mary
under
way
at
once
to
consider
a
proper
wardrobe
for
myself
and
in
particular
i
lacked
a
coat
heavens
how
i
lacked
that
coat
and
moreover
i
was
cooped
up
with
two
of
the
worst
bores
in
christendom
pollack
and
the
captain
pollack
after
conducting
his
illness
in
a
style
better
adapted
to
the
capacity
of
an
opera
house
than
a
small
compartment
suddenly
got
insupportably
well
and
breezy
and
produced
a
manly
pipe
in
which
he
smoked
a
tobacco
as
blond
as
himself
and
divided
his
time
almost
equally
between
smoking
it
and
trying
to
clean
it
there
s
only
three
things
you
can
clean
a
pipe
with
he
used
to
remark
with
a
twist
of
paper
in
hand
the
best
s
a
feather
the
second
s
a
straw
and
the
third
s
a
girl
s
hairpin
i
never
see
such
a
ship
you
can
t
find
any
of
em
last
time
i
came
this
way
i
did
find
hairpins
anyway
and
found
em
on
the
floor
of
the
captain
s
cabin
regular
deposit
eh
feelin
better
at
which
i
usually
swore
oh
you
ll
be
all
right
soon
don
t
mind
my
puffin
a
bit
eh
he
never
tired
of
asking
me
to
have
a
hand
at
nap
good
game
makes
you
forget
it
and
that
s
half
the
he
would
sit
swaying
with
the
rolling
of
the
ship
and
suck
at
his
pipe
of
blond
tobacco
and
look
with
an
inexpressibly
sage
but
somnolent
blue
eye
at
the
captain
by
the
hour
together
captain
s
a
card
he
would
say
over
and
over
again
as
the
outcome
of
these
meditations
he
d
like
to
know
what
we
re
up
to
he
d
like
to
know
no
that
did
seem
to
be
the
captain
s
ruling
idea
but
he
also
wanted
to
impress
me
with
the
notion
that
he
was
a
gentleman
of
good
family
and
to
air
a
number
of
views
adverse
to
the
english
to
english
literature
to
the
english
constitution
and
the
like
he
had
learnt
the
sea
in
the
roumanian
navy
and
english
out
of
a
book
he
would
still
at
times
pronounce
the
e
s
at
the
end
of
there
and
here
he
was
a
naturalised
englishman
and
he
drove
me
into
a
reluctant
and
uncongenial
patriotism
by
his
everlasting
carping
at
things
english
pollack
would
set
himself
to
draw
him
heaven
alone
can
tell
how
near
i
came
to
murder
days
i
had
outward
cooped
up
with
these
two
and
a
shy
and
profoundly
depressed
mate
who
read
the
bible
on
sundays
and
spent
the
rest
of
his
leisure
in
lethargy
three
and
fifty
days
of
life
cooped
up
in
a
perpetual
smell
in
a
persistent
sick
hunger
that
turned
from
the
sight
of
food
in
darkness
cold
and
wet
in
a
lightly
ballasted
ship
that
rolled
and
pitched
and
swayed
and
all
the
time
the
sands
in
the
of
my
uncle
s
fortunes
were
streaming
out
misery
amidst
it
all
i
remember
only
one
thing
brightly
one
morning
of
sunshine
in
the
bay
of
biscay
and
a
vision
of
frothing
waves
sapphire
green
a
bird
following
our
wake
and
our
masts
rolling
about
the
sky
then
wind
and
rain
close
in
on
us
again
you
must
not
imagine
they
were
ordinary
days
days
i
mean
of
an
average
length
they
were
not
so
much
days
as
long
damp
slabs
of
time
that
stretched
each
one
to
the
horizon
and
much
of
that
length
was
night
one
paraded
the
staggering
deck
in
a
borrowed
sou
hour
after
hour
in
the
chilly
windy
splashing
and
spitting
darkness
or
sat
in
the
cabin
bored
and
ill
and
looked
at
the
faces
of
those
inseparable
companions
by
the
help
of
a
lamp
that
gave
smell
rather
than
light
then
one
would
see
going
up
up
up
and
then
sinking
down
down
down
pollack
extinct
pipe
in
mouth
humorously
observant
bringing
his
mind
slowly
to
the
decision
that
the
captain
was
a
card
while
the
words
flowed
from
the
latter
in
a
nimble
incessant
good
dis

he
had
all
those
violent
adjuncts
to
speech
we
western
europeans
have
abandoned
shruggings
of
the
shoulders
waving
of
the
arms
thrusting
out
of
the
face
wonderful
grimaces
and
twiddlings
of
the
hands
under
your
nose
until
you
wanted
to
hit
them
away
day
after
day
it
went
on
and
i
had
to
keep
any
anger
to
myself
to
reserve
myself
for
the
time
ahead
when
it
would
be
necessary
to
see
the
quap
was
got
aboard
and
stowed
knee
deep
in
this
man
s
astonishment
i
knew
he
would
make
a
thousand
objections
to
all
we
had
before
us
he
talked
like
a
drugged
man
it
ran
glibly
over
his
tongue
and
all
the
time
one
could
see
his
seamanship
fretting
him
he
was
gnawed
by
responsibility
perpetually
uneasy
about
the
ship
s
position
perpetually
imagining
dangers
if
a
sea
hit
us
exceptionally
hard
he
d
be
out
of
the
cabin
in
an
instant
making
an
outcry
of
inquiries
and
he
was
pursued
by
a
dread
of
the
hold
of
ballast
shifting
of
insidious
wicked
leaks
as
we
drew
near
the
african
coast
his
fear
of
rocks
and
shoals
became
infectious
i
do
not
know
dis
coast
he
used
to
say
i
cama
hera
because
was
coming
too
den
he
does
not
come
fortunes
of
war
i
said
and
tried
to
think
in
vain
if
any
motive
but
sheer
haphazard
could
have
guided
in
the
choice
of
these
two
men
i
think
perhaps
had
the
artistic
temperament
and
wanted
contrasts
and
also
that
the
captain
helped
him
to
express
his
own
malignant
he
was
indeed
an
exceptionally
inefficient
captain
on
the
whole
i
was
glad
i
had
come
even
at
the
eleventh
hour
to
see
to
things
the
captain
did
at
last
out
of
sheer
nervousness
get
aground
at
the
end
of
mordet
s
island
but
we
got
off
in
an
hour
or
so
with
a
swell
and
a
little
hard
work
in
the
boat
i
suspected
the
mate
of
his
opinion
of
the
captain
long
before
he
expressed
it
he
was
i
say
a
taciturn
man
but
one
day
speech
broke
through
him
he
had
been
sitting
at
the
table
with
his
arms
folded
on
it
musing
drearily
pipe
in
mouth
and
the
voice
of
the
captain
drifted
down
from
above
the
mate
lifted
his
heavy
eyes
to
me
and
regarded
me
for
a
moment
then
he
began
to
heave
with
the
beginnings
of
speech
he
disembarrassed
himself
of
his
pipe
i
cowered
with
expectation
speech
was
coming
at
last
before
he
spoke
he
nodded
reassuringly
once
or
twice
e
he
moved
his
head
strangely
and
mysteriously
but
a
child
might
have
known
he
spoke
of
the
captain
e
s
a
he
regarded
me
doubtfully
for
a
time
and
at
last
decided
for
the
sake
of
lucidity
to
clench
the
matter
that
s
what
e
is
a
dago
he
nodded
like
a
man
who
gives
a
last
tap
to
a
nail
and
i
could
see
he
considered
his
remark
well
and
truly
laid
his
face
though
still
resolute
became
as
tranquil
and
uneventful
as
a
huge
hall
after
a
public
meeting
has
dispersed
out
of
it
and
finally
he
closed
and
locked
it
with
his
pipe
roumanian
jew
isn
t
he
i
said
he
nodded
darkly
and
almost
forbiddingly
more
would
have
been
too
much
the
thing
was
said
but
from
that
time
forth
i
knew
i
could
depend
upon
him
and
that
he
and
i
were
friends
it
happens
i
never
did
have
to
depend
upon
him
but
that
does
not
affect
our
relationship
forward
the
crew
lived
lives
very
much
after
the
fashion
of
ours
more
crowded
more
cramped
and
dirty
wetter
steamier
more
verminous
the
coarse
food
they
had
was
still
not
so
coarse
but
that
they
did
not
think
they
were
living
like
fighting
so
far
as
i
could
make
out
they
were
all
nearly
destitute
men
hardly
any
of
them
had
a
proper
sea
outfit
and
what
small
possessions
they
had
were
a
source
of
mutual
distrust
and
as
we
pitched
and
floundered
southward
they
gambled
and
fought
were
brutal
to
one
another
argued
and
wrangled
loudly
until
we
protested
at
the
uproar
there
s
no
romance
about
the
sea
in
a
small
sailing
ship
as
i
saw
it
the
romance
is
in
the
mind
of
the
landsman
dreamer
these
brigs
and
schooners
and
brigantines
that
still
stand
out
from
every
little
port
are
relics
from
an
age
of
petty
trade
as
rotten
and
obsolescent
as
a
georgian
house
that
has
sunken
into
a
slum
they
are
indeed
just
floating
fragments
of
slum
much
as
icebergs
are
floating
fragments
of
glacier
the
civilised
man
who
has
learnt
to
wash
who
has
developed
a
sense
of
physical
honour
of
cleanly
temperate
feeding
of
time
can
endure
them
no
more
they
pass
and
the
clanking
steamers
will
follow
them
giving
place
to
cleaner
finer
things
but
so
it
was
i
made
my
voyage
to
africa
and
came
at
last
into
a
world
of
steamy
fogs
and
a
hot
smell
of
vegetable
decay
and
into
sound
and
sight
of
surf
and
distant
intermittent
glimpses
of
the
coast
i
lived
a
strange
concentrated
life
through
all
that
time
such
a
life
as
a
creature
must
do
that
has
fallen
in
a
well
all
my
former
ways
ceased
all
my
old
vistas
became
memories
the
situation
i
was
saving
was
very
small
and
distant
now
i
felt
its
urgency
no
more
beatrice
and
lady
grove
my
uncle
and
the
hardingham
my
soaring
in
the
air
and
my
habitual
wide
vision
of
swift
effectual
things
became
as
remote
as
if
they
were
in
some
world
i
had
left
for
ever
iv
all
these
african
memories
stand
by
themselves
it
was
for
me
an
expedition
into
the
realms
of
undisciplined
nature
out
of
the
world
that
is
ruled
by
men
my
first
bout
with
that
hot
side
of
our
mother
that
gives
you
the
jungle
that
cold
side
that
gives
you
the
i
was
beginning
to
know
passing
well
they
are
memories
woven
upon
a
fabric
of
sunshine
and
heat
and
a
constant
warm
smell
of
decay
they
end
in
rain
such
rain
as
i
had
never
seen
before
a
vehement
a
frantic
downpouring
of
water
but
our
first
slow
passage
through
the
channels
behind
mordet
s
island
was
in
incandescent
sunshine
there
we
go
in
my
memory
still
a
blistered
dirty
ship
with
patched
sails
and
a
battered
mermaid
to
present
maud
mary
sounding
and
taking
thought
between
high
ranks
of
forest
whose
trees
come
out
at
last
in
the
water
there
we
go
with
a
little
breeze
on
our
quarter
mordet
island
rounded
and
the
quap
it
might
be
within
a
day
of
us
here
and
there
strange
blossoms
woke
the
dank
intensities
of
green
with
a
trumpet
call
of
colour
things
crept
among
the
jungle
and
peeped
and
dashed
back
rustling
into
stillness
always
in
the
sluggishly
drifting
opaque
water
were
eddyings
and
stirrings
little
rushes
of
bubbles
came
chuckling
up
from
this
or
that
submerged
conflict
and
tragedy
now
and
again
were
crocodiles
like
a
stranded
fleet
of
logs
basking
in
the
sun
still
it
was
by
day
a
dreary
stillness
broken
only
by
insect
sounds
and
the
creaking
and
flapping
of
our
progress
by
the
calling
of
the
soundings
and
the
captain
s
confused
shouts
but
in
the
night
as
we
lay
moored
to
a
clump
of
trees
the
darkness
brought
a
thousand
swampy
things
to
life
and
out
of
the
forest
came
screaming
and
howlings
screaming
and
yells
that
made
us
glad
to
be
afloat
and
once
we
saw
between
the
tree
stems
long
blazing
fires
we
passed
two
or
three
villages
landward
and
women
and
children
came
and
stared
at
us
and
gesticulated
and
once
a
man
came
out
in
a
boat
from
a
creek
and
hailed
us
in
an
unknown
tongue
and
so
at
last
we
came
to
a
great
open
place
a
broad
lake
rimmed
with
a
desolation
of
mud
and
bleached
refuse
and
dead
trees
free
from
crocodiles
or
water
birds
or
sight
or
sound
of
any
living
thing
and
saw
far
off
even
as
nasmyth
had
described
the
ruins
of
the
deserted
station
and
hard
by
two
little
heaps
of
rubbish
under
a
great
rib
of
rock
the
quap
the
forest
receded
the
land
to
the
right
of
us
fell
away
and
became
barren
and
far
on
across
notch
in
its
backbone
was
surf
and
the
sea
we
took
the
ship
in
towards
those
heaps
and
the
ruined
jetty
slowly
and
carefully
the
captain
came
and
talked
this
is
eet
he
said
yes
said
i
is
eet
for
trade
we
have
come
this
was
ironical
no
said
i
would
haf
told
me
long
ago
what
it
ees
for
we
haf
i
ll
tell
you
now
i
said
we
are
going
to
lay
in
as
close
as
we
can
to
those
two
heaps
of
stuff
you
see
them
under
the
rock
then
we
are
going
to
chuck
all
our
ballast
overboard
and
take
those
in
then
we
re
going
may
i
presume
to
ask
is
eet
gold
no
i
said
incivilly
it
isn
then
what
is
it
it
s
stuff
of
some
commercial
we
can
t
do
eet
he
said
we
can
i
answered
reassuringly
we
can
t
he
said
as
confidently
i
don
t
mean
what
you
mean
you
know
so
liddle
but
dis
is
forbidden
i
turned
on
him
suddenly
angry
and
met
bright
excited
eyes
for
a
minute
we
scrutinised
one
another
then
i
said
that
s
our
risk
trade
is
forbidden
but
this
isn
t
trade
this
thing
s
got
to
be
his
eyes
glittered
and
he
shook
his
head
the
brig
stood
in
slowly
through
the
twilight
toward
this
strange
scorched
and
blistered
stretch
of
beach
and
the
man
at
the
wheel
strained
his
ears
to
listening
the
angry
argument
that
began
between
myself
and
the
captain
that
was
presently
joined
by
pollack
we
moored
at
last
within
a
hundred
yards
of
our
goal
and
all
through
our
dinner
and
far
into
the
night
we
argued
intermittently
and
fiercely
with
the
captain
about
our
right
to
load
just
what
we
pleased
i
will
haf
nothing
to
do
with
eet
he
persisted
i
wash
my
it
seemed
that
night
as
though
we
argued
in
vain
if
it
is
not
trade
he
said
it
is
prospecting
and
mining
that
is
worse
any
one
who
knows
anything
outside
england
knows
that
is
we
argued
and
i
lost
my
temper
and
swore
at
him
pollack
kept
cooler
and
chewed
his
pipe
watchfully
with
that
blue
eye
of
his
upon
the
captain
s
gestures
finally
i
went
on
deck
to
cool
the
sky
was
overcast
i
discovered
all
the
men
were
in
a
knot
forward
staring
at
the
faint
quivering
luminosity
that
had
spread
over
the
heaps
of
quap
a
phosphorescence
such
as
one
sees
at
times
on
rotting
wood
and
about
the
beach
east
and
west
there
were
patches
and
streaks
of
something
like
diluted
moonshine
in
the
small
hours
i
was
still
awake
and
turning
over
scheme
after
scheme
in
my
mind
whereby
i
might
circumvent
the
captain
s
opposition
i
meant
to
get
that
quap
aboard
if
i
had
to
kill
some
one
to
do
it
never
in
my
life
had
i
been
so
thwarted
after
this
intolerable
voyage
there
came
a
rap
at
my
cabin
door
and
then
it
opened
and
i
made
out
a
bearded
face
come
in
i
said
and
a
black
voluble
figure
i
could
just
see
obscurely
came
in
to
talk
in
my
private
ear
and
fill
my
cabin
with
its
whisperings
and
gestures
it
was
the
captain
he
too
had
been
awake
and
thinking
things
over
he
had
come
to
explain
enormously
i
lay
there
hating
him
and
wondering
if
i
and
pollack
could
lock
him
in
his
cabin
and
run
the
ship
without
him
i
do
not
want
to
spoil
dis
expedition
emerged
from
a
cloud
of
protestations
and
then
i
was
able
to
disentangle
a
commission
shush
a
small
commission
for
special
risks
special
risks
became
frequent
i
let
him
explain
himself
out
it
appeared
he
was
also
demanding
an
apology
for
something
i
had
said
no
doubt
i
had
insulted
him
generously
at
last
came
definite
offers
i
broke
my
silence
and
bargained
pollack
i
cried
and
hammered
the
partition
what
s
up
asked
pollack
i
stated
the
case
concisely
there
came
a
silence
he
s
a
card
said
pollack
let
s
give
him
his
commission
i
don
t
eh
i
cried
i
said
he
was
a
card
that
s
all
said
pollack
i
m
he
appeared
in
my
doorway
a
faint
white
figure
joined
our
vehement
whisperings
we
had
to
buy
the
captain
off
we
had
to
promise
him
ten
per
cent
of
our
problematical
profits
we
were
to
give
him
ten
per
cent
on
what
we
sold
the
cargo
for
over
and
above
his
legitimate
pay
and
i
found
in
my
and
disordered
state
small
consolation
in
the
thought
that
i
as
the
expedition
was
to
sell
the
stuff
to
myself
as
business
organisations
and
he
further
exasperated
me
by
insisting
on
having
our
bargain
in
writing
in
the
form
of
a
letter
he
insisted
all
right
i
acquiesced
in
the
form
of
a
letter
here
goes
get
a
light
and
the
apology
he
said
folding
up
the
letter
all
right
i
said
my
hand
shook
with
anger
as
i
wrote
and
afterwards
i
could
not
sleep
for
hate
of
him
at
last
i
got
up
i
suffered
i
found
from
an
unusual
clumsiness
i
struck
my
toe
against
my
cabin
door
and
cut
myself
as
i
shaved
i
found
myself
at
last
pacing
the
deck
under
the
dawn
in
a
mood
of
extreme
exasperation
the
sun
rose
abruptly
and
splashed
light
blindingly
into
my
eyes
and
i
swore
at
the
sun
i
found
myself
imagining
fresh
obstacles
with
the
men
and
talking
aloud
in
anticipatory
rehearsal
of
the
consequent
row
the
malaria
of
the
quap
was
already
in
my
blood
v
sooner
or
later
the
ridiculous
embargo
that
now
lies
upon
all
the
coast
eastward
of
mordet
island
will
be
lifted
and
the
reality
of
the
deposits
of
quap
ascertained
i
am
sure
that
we
were
merely
taking
the
outcrop
of
a
stratum
of
nodulated
deposits
that
dip
steeply
seaward
those
heaps
were
merely
the
crumbled
out
contents
of
two
irregular
cavities
in
the
rock
they
are
as
natural
as
any
talus
or
heap
of
that
kind
and
the
mud
along
the
edge
of
the
water
for
miles
is
mixed
with
quap
and
is
and
lifeless
and
faintly
phosphorescent
at
night
but
the
reader
will
find
the
full
particulars
of
my
impression
of
all
this
in
the
geological
magazine
for
october
and
to
that
i
must
refer
him
there
too
he
will
find
my
unconfirmed
theories
of
its
nature
if
i
am
right
it
is
something
far
more
significant
from
the
scientific
point
of
view
than
those
incidental
constituents
of
various
rare
metals
pitchblende
rutile
and
the
like
upon
which
the
revolutionary
discoveries
of
the
last
decade
are
based
those
are
just
little
molecular
centres
of
disintegration
of
that
mysterious
decay
and
rotting
of
those
elements
elements
once
regarded
as
the
most
stable
things
in
nature
but
there
is
something
the
only
word
that
comes
near
it
is
cancerous
and
that
is
not
very
near
about
the
whole
of
quap
something
that
creeps
and
lives
as
a
disease
lives
by
destroying
an
elemental
stirring
and
disarrangement
incalculably
maleficent
and
strange
this
is
no
imaginative
comparison
of
mine
to
my
mind
is
a
real
disease
of
matter
moreover
it
is
a
contagious
disease
it
spreads
you
bring
those
debased
and
crumbling
atoms
near
others
and
those
too
presently
catch
the
trick
of
swinging
themselves
out
of
coherent
existence
it
is
in
matter
exactly
what
the
decay
of
our
old
culture
is
in
society
a
loss
of
traditions
and
distinctions
and
assured
reactions
when
i
think
of
these
inexplicable
dissolvent
centres
that
have
come
into
being
in
our
globe
these
quap
heaps
are
surely
by
far
the
largest
that
have
yet
been
found
in
the
world
the
rest
as
yet
mere
specks
in
grains
and
crystals
i
am
haunted
by
a
grotesque
fancy
of
the
ultimate
eating
away
and
and
dispersal
of
all
our
world
so
that
while
man
still
struggles
and
dreams
his
very
substance
will
change
and
crumble
from
beneath
him
i
mention
this
here
as
a
queer
persistent
fancy
suppose
indeed
that
is
to
be
the
end
of
our
planet
no
splendid
climax
and
finale
no
towering
accumulation
of
achievements
but
just
atomic
decay
i
add
that
to
the
ideas
of
the
suffocating
comet
the
dark
body
out
of
space
the
burning
out
of
the
sun
the
distorted
orbit
as
a
new
and
far
more
possible
end
as
science
can
see
ends
to
this
strange
of
matter
that
we
call
human
life
i
do
not
believe
this
can
be
the
end
no
human
soul
can
believe
in
such
an
end
and
go
on
living
but
to
it
science
points
as
a
possible
thing
science
and
reason
alike
if
single
human
beings
if
one
single
ricketty
infant
can
be
born
as
it
were
by
accident
and
die
futile
why
not
the
whole
race
these
are
questions
i
have
never
answered
that
now
i
never
attempt
to
answer
but
the
thought
of
quap
and
its
mysteries
brings
them
back
to
me
i
can
witness
that
the
beach
and
mud
for
two
miles
or
more
either
way
was
a
lifeless
beach
lifeless
as
i
could
have
imagined
no
tropical
mud
could
ever
be
and
all
the
dead
branches
and
leaves
and
rotting
dead
fish
and
so
forth
that
drifted
ashore
became
presently
shrivelled
and
white
sometimes
crocodiles
would
come
up
out
of
the
water
and
bask
and
now
and
then
water
birds
would
explore
the
mud
and
rocky
ribs
that
rose
out
of
it
in
a
mood
of
transitory
speculation
that
was
its
utmost
admiration
and
the
air
felt
at
once
hot
and
austere
dry
and
blistering
and
altogether
different
the
warm
moist
embrace
that
had
met
us
at
our
first
african
landfall
and
to
which
we
had
grown
accustomed
i
believe
that
the
primary
influence
of
the
quap
upon
us
was
to
increase
the
conductivity
of
our
nerves
but
that
is
a
mere
unjustifiable
speculation
on
my
part
at
any
rate
it
gave
a
sort
of
east
wind
effect
to
life
we
all
became
irritable
clumsy
languid
and
disposed
to
be
impatient
with
our
languor
we
moored
the
brig
to
the
rocks
with
difficulty
and
got
aground
on
mud
and
decided
to
stick
there
and
tow
off
when
we
had
done
the
bottom
was
as
greasy
as
butter
our
efforts
to
fix
up
planks
and
sleepers
in
order
to
wheel
the
quap
aboard
were
as
as
that
sort
of
work
can
be
and
that
sort
of
work
can
at
times
be
very
the
captain
had
a
superstitious
fear
of
his
hold
he
became
wildly
gesticulatory
and
expository
and
incompetent
at
the
bare
thought
of
it
his
shouts
still
echo
in
my
memory
becoming
as
each
crisis
approached
less
and
less
like
any
known
tongue
but
i
can
not
now
write
the
history
of
those
days
of
blundering
and
toil
of
how
milton
one
of
the
boys
fell
from
a
plank
to
the
beach
thirty
feet
perhaps
with
his
barrow
and
broke
his
arm
and
i
believe
a
rib
of
how
i
and
pollack
set
the
limb
and
nursed
him
through
the
fever
that
followed
of
how
one
man
after
another
succumbed
to
a
feverish
malaria
and
how
i
by
virtue
of
my
scientific
reputation
was
obliged
to
play
the
part
of
doctor
and
dose
them
with
quinine
and
then
finding
that
worse
than
nothing
with
rum
and
small
doses
of
easton
s
syrup
of
which
there
chanced
to
be
a
case
of
bottles
aboard
heaven
and
know
why
for
three
long
days
we
lay
in
misery
and
never
shipped
a
then
when
they
resumed
the
men
s
hands
broke
out
into
sores
there
were
no
gloves
available
and
i
tried
to
get
them
while
they
shovelled
and
wheeled
to
cover
their
hands
with
stockings
or
greased
rags
they
would
not
do
this
on
account
of
the
heat
and
discomfort
this
attempt
of
mine
did
however
direct
their
attention
to
the
quap
as
the
source
of
their
illness
and
precipitated
what
in
the
end
finished
our
lading
an
informal
strike
we
ve
had
enough
of
this
they
said
and
they
meant
it
they
came
aft
to
say
as
much
they
cowed
the
captain
through
all
these
days
the
weather
was
variously
vile
first
a
furnace
heat
under
a
sky
of
a
scowling
intensity
of
blue
then
a
hot
fog
that
stuck
in
one
s
throat
like
wool
and
turned
the
men
on
the
planks
into
colourless
figures
of
giants
then
a
wild
burst
of
thunderstorms
mad
elemental
uproar
and
rain
through
it
all
against
illness
heat
confusion
of
mind
one
master
impetus
prevailed
with
me
to
keep
the
shipping
going
to
maintain
one
motif
at
least
whatever
else
arose
or
ceased
the
chuff
of
the
spades
the
squeaking
and
shriek
of
the
barrows
the
pluppa
pluppa
pluppa
as
the
men
came
trotting
along
the
swinging
high
planks
and
then
at
last
the
dollop
dollop
as
the
stuff
shot
into
the
hold
another
thank
god
another
fifteen
hundred
or
it
may
be
two
thousand
pounds
for
the
saving
of
ponderevo
i
found
out
many
things
about
myself
and
humanity
in
those
weeks
of
effort
behind
mordet
island
i
understand
now
the
heart
of
the
sweater
of
the
harsh
employer
of
the
i
had
brought
these
men
into
a
danger
they
didn
t
understand
i
was
fiercely
resolved
to
overcome
their
opposition
and
bend
and
use
them
for
my
purpose
and
i
hated
the
men
but
i
hated
all
humanity
during
the
time
that
the
quap
was
near
me
and
my
mind
was
pervaded
too
by
a
sense
of
urgency
and
by
the
fear
that
we
should
be
discovered
and
our
proceedings
stopped
i
wanted
to
get
out
to
sea
again
to
be
beating
up
northward
with
our
plunder
i
was
afraid
our
masts
showed
to
seaward
and
might
betray
us
to
some
curious
passer
on
the
high
sea
and
one
evening
near
the
end
i
saw
a
canoe
with
three
natives
far
off
down
the
lake
i
got
from
the
captain
and
scrutinised
them
and
i
could
see
them
staring
at
us
one
man
might
have
been
a
and
was
dressed
in
white
they
watched
us
for
some
time
very
quietly
and
then
paddled
off
into
some
channel
in
the
forest
shadows
and
for
three
nights
running
so
that
it
took
a
painful
grip
upon
my
inflamed
imagination
i
dreamt
of
my
uncle
s
face
only
that
it
was
ghastly
white
like
a
clown
s
and
the
throat
was
cut
from
ear
to
ear
a
long
ochreous
cut
too
late
he
said
too
late
vi
a
day
or
so
after
we
had
got
to
work
upon
the
quap
i
found
myself
so
sleepless
and
miserable
that
the
ship
became
unendurable
just
before
the
rush
of
sunrise
i
borrowed
pollack
s
gun
walked
down
the
planks
clambered
over
the
quap
heaps
and
prowled
along
the
beach
i
went
perhaps
a
mile
and
a
half
that
day
and
some
distance
beyond
the
ruins
of
the
old
station
i
became
interested
in
the
desolation
about
me
and
found
when
i
returned
that
i
was
able
to
sleep
for
nearly
an
hour
it
was
delightful
to
have
been
alone
for
so
long
no
captain
no
pollack
no
one
accordingly
i
repeated
this
expedition
the
next
morning
and
the
next
until
it
became
a
custom
with
me
there
was
little
for
me
to
do
once
the
digging
and
wheeling
was
organised
and
so
these
prowlings
of
mine
grew
longer
and
longer
and
presently
i
began
to
take
food
with
me
i
pushed
these
walks
far
beyond
the
area
desolated
by
the
quap
on
the
edges
of
that
was
first
a
zone
of
stunted
vegetation
then
a
sort
of
swampy
jungle
that
was
difficult
to
penetrate
and
then
the
beginnings
of
the
forest
a
scene
of
huge
tree
stems
and
tangled
creeper
ropes
and
roots
mingled
with
oozy
mud
here
i
used
to
loaf
in
a
state
between
botanising
and
reverie
always
very
anxious
to
know
what
was
up
above
in
the
sunlight
and
here
it
was
i
murdered
a
man
it
was
the
most
unmeaning
and
purposeless
murder
imaginable
even
as
i
write
down
its
particulars
there
comes
again
the
sense
of
its
strangeness
its
pointlessness
its
incompatibility
with
any
of
the
neat
and
definite
theories
people
hold
about
life
and
the
meaning
of
the
world
i
did
this
thing
and
i
want
to
tell
of
my
doing
it
but
why
i
did
it
and
particularly
why
i
should
be
held
responsible
for
it
i
can
not
explain
that
morning
i
had
come
upon
a
track
in
the
forest
and
it
had
occurred
to
me
as
a
disagreeable
idea
that
this
was
a
human
pathway
i
didn
t
want
to
come
upon
any
human
beings
the
less
our
expedition
saw
of
the
african
population
the
better
for
its
prospects
thus
far
we
had
been
singularly
free
from
native
pestering
so
i
turned
back
and
was
making
my
way
over
mud
and
roots
and
dead
fronds
and
petals
scattered
from
the
green
world
above
when
abruptly
i
saw
my
victim
i
became
aware
of
him
perhaps
forty
feet
off
standing
quite
still
and
regarding
me
he
wasn
t
by
any
means
a
pretty
figure
he
was
very
black
and
naked
except
for
a
dirty
his
legs
were
and
his
toes
spread
wide
and
the
upper
edge
of
his
cloth
and
a
girdle
of
string
cut
his
clumsy
abdomen
into
folds
his
forehead
was
low
his
nose
very
flat
and
his
lower
lip
swollen
and
his
hair
was
short
and
fuzzy
and
about
his
neck
was
a
string
and
a
little
purse
of
skin
he
carried
a
musket
and
a
was
stuck
in
his
girdle
it
was
a
curious
confrontation
there
opposed
to
him
stood
i
a
little
soiled
perhaps
but
still
a
rather
elaborately
civilised
human
being
born
bred
and
trained
in
a
vague
tradition
in
my
hand
was
an
unaccustomed
gun
and
each
of
us
was
essentially
a
teeming
vivid
brain
tensely
excited
by
the
encounter
quite
unaware
of
the
other
s
mental
content
or
what
to
do
with
him
he
stepped
back
a
pace
or
so
stumbled
and
turned
to
run
stop
i
cried
stop
you
fool
and
started
to
run
after
him
shouting
such
things
in
english
but
i
was
no
match
for
him
over
the
roots
and
mud
i
had
a
preposterous
idea
he
mustn
t
get
away
and
tell
them
and
with
that
instantly
i
brought
both
feet
together
raised
my
gun
aimed
quite
coolly
drew
the
trigger
carefully
and
shot
him
neatly
in
the
back
i
saw
and
saw
with
a
leap
of
pure
exaltation
the
smash
of
my
bullet
between
his
shoulder
blades
got
him
said
i
dropping
my
gun
and
down
he
flopped
and
died
without
a
groan
by
jove
i
cried
with
note
of
surprise
i
ve
killed
him
i
looked
about
me
and
then
went
forward
cautiously
in
a
mood
between
curiosity
and
astonishment
to
look
at
this
man
whose
soul
i
had
flung
so
unceremoniously
out
of
our
common
world
i
went
to
him
not
as
one
goes
to
something
one
has
made
or
done
but
as
one
approaches
something
found
he
was
frightfully
smashed
out
in
front
he
must
have
died
in
the
instant
i
stooped
and
raised
him
by
his
shoulder
and
realised
that
i
dropped
him
and
stood
about
and
peered
about
me
through
the
trees
my
word
i
said
he
was
the
second
dead
human
being
apart
i
mean
from
surgical
properties
and
mummies
and
common
shows
of
that
sort
that
i
have
ever
seen
i
stood
over
him
wondering
wondering
beyond
measure
a
practical
idea
came
into
that
confusion
had
any
one
heard
the
gun
i
reloaded
after
a
time
i
felt
securer
and
gave
my
mind
again
to
the
dead
i
had
killed
what
must
i
do
it
occurred
to
me
that
perhaps
i
ought
to
bury
him
at
any
rate
i
ought
to
hide
him
i
reflected
coolly
and
then
put
my
gun
within
easy
reach
and
dragged
him
by
the
arm
towards
a
place
where
the
mud
seemed
soft
and
thrust
him
in
his
slipped
from
his
and
i
went
back
to
get
it
then
i
pressed
him
down
with
the
butt
of
my
rifle
afterwards
this
all
seemed
to
me
most
horrible
but
at
the
time
it
was
entirely
a
transaction
i
looked
round
for
any
other
visible
evidence
of
his
fate
looked
round
as
one
does
when
one
packs
one
s
portmanteau
in
an
hotel
bedroom
when
i
got
my
bearings
and
carefully
returned
towards
the
ship
i
had
the
mood
of
grave
concentration
of
a
boy
who
has
lapsed
into
poaching
and
the
business
only
began
to
assume
proper
proportions
for
me
as
i
got
near
the
ship
to
seem
any
other
kind
of
thing
than
the
killing
of
a
bird
or
rabbit
in
the
night
however
it
took
on
enormous
and
portentous
forms
by
god
i
cried
suddenly
starting
wide
awake
but
it
was
murder
i
lay
after
that
wide
awake
staring
at
my
memories
in
some
odd
way
these
visions
mixed
up
with
my
dream
of
in
my
uncle
in
his
despair
the
black
body
which
saw
now
damaged
and
partly
buried
but
which
nevertheless
i
no
longer
felt
was
dead
but
acutely
alive
and
perceiving
i
mixed
up
with
the
ochreous
slash
under
my
uncle
s
face
i
tried
to
dismiss
this
horrible
obsession
from
my
mind
but
it
prevailed
over
all
my
efforts
the
next
day
was
utterly
black
with
my
sense
of
that
ugly
creature
s
body
i
am
the
least
superstitious
of
men
but
it
drew
me
it
drew
me
back
into
those
thickets
to
the
very
place
where
i
had
hidden
him
some
evil
and
detestable
beast
had
been
at
him
and
he
lay
disinterred
methodically
i
buried
his
swollen
and
mangled
carcass
again
and
returned
to
the
ship
for
another
night
of
dreams
next
day
for
all
the
morning
i
resisted
the
impulse
to
go
to
him
and
played
nap
with
pollack
with
my
secret
gnawing
at
me
and
in
the
evening
started
to
go
and
was
near
benighted
i
never
told
a
soul
of
them
of
this
thing
i
had
done
next
day
i
went
early
and
he
had
gone
and
there
were
human
footmarks
and
ugly
stains
round
the
muddy
hole
from
which
he
had
been
dragged
i
returned
to
the
ship
disconcerted
and
perplexed
that
day
it
was
the
men
came
aft
with
blistered
hands
and
faces
and
sullen
eyes
when
they
proclaimed
through
edwards
their
spokesman
we
ve
had
enough
of
this
and
we
mean
it
i
answered
very
readily
so
have
let
s
vii
we
were
none
too
soon
people
had
been
reconnoitring
us
the
telegraph
had
been
at
work
and
we
were
not
four
hours
at
sea
before
we
ran
against
the
gunboat
that
had
been
sent
down
the
coast
to
look
for
us
and
that
would
have
caught
us
behind
the
island
like
a
beast
in
a
trap
it
was
a
night
of
driving
cloud
that
gave
intermittent
gleams
of
moonlight
the
wind
and
sea
were
strong
and
we
were
rolling
along
through
a
drift
of
rails
and
mist
suddenly
the
world
was
white
with
moonshine
the
gunboat
came
out
as
a
long
dark
shape
wallowing
on
the
water
to
the
east
she
sighted
the
maud
mary
at
once
and
fired
some
sort
of
popgun
to
arrest
us
the
mate
turned
to
me
shall
i
tell
the
captain
the
captain
be
damned
said
i
and
we
let
him
sleep
through
two
hours
of
chase
till
a
rainstorm
swallowed
us
up
then
we
changed
our
course
and
sailed
right
across
them
and
by
morning
only
her
smoke
was
showing
we
were
clear
of
africa
and
with
the
booty
aboard
i
did
not
see
what
stood
between
us
and
home
for
the
first
time
since
i
had
fallen
sick
in
the
thames
my
spirits
rose
i
was
and
physically
disgusted
of
course
but
i
felt
kindly
in
spite
of
my
qualms
so
far
as
i
could
calculate
then
the
situation
was
saved
i
saw
myself
returning
triumphantly
into
the
thames
and
nothing
on
earth
to
prevent
old
capern
s
perfect
filament
going
on
the
market
in
fortnight
i
had
the
monopoly
of
electric
lamps
beneath
my
feet
i
was
released
from
the
spell
of
that
bloodstained
black
body
all
mixed
up
with
mud
i
was
going
back
to
baths
and
decent
food
and
aeronautics
and
beatrice
i
was
going
back
to
beatrice
and
my
real
life
again
out
of
this
well
into
which
i
had
fallen
it
would
have
needed
something
more
than
and
quap
fever
to
prevent
my
spirits
rising
i
told
the
captain
that
i
agreed
with
him
that
the
british
were
the
scum
of
europe
the
westward
drift
of
all
the
people
a
disgusting
rabble
and
i
lost
three
pounds
by
attenuated
retail
to
pollack
at
ha
penny
nap
and
euchre
and
then
you
know
as
we
got
out
into
the
atlantic
this
side
of
cape
verde
the
ship
began
to
go
to
pieces
i
don
t
pretend
for
one
moment
to
understand
what
happened
but
i
think
greiffenhagen
s
recent
work
on
the
effects
of
radium
upon
ligneous
tissue
does
rather
carry
out
my
idea
that
emanations
from
quap
have
rapid
rotting
effect
upon
woody
fibre
from
the
first
there
had
been
a
different
feel
about
the
ship
and
as
the
big
winds
and
waves
began
to
strain
her
she
commenced
leaking
soon
she
was
leaking
not
at
any
particular
point
but
everywhere
she
did
not
spring
a
leak
i
mean
but
water
came
in
first
of
all
near
the
decaying
edges
of
her
planks
and
then
through
them
i
firmly
believe
the
water
came
through
the
wood
first
it
began
to
ooze
then
to
trickle
it
was
like
trying
to
carry
moist
sugar
in
a
thin
paper
bag
soon
we
were
taking
in
water
as
though
we
had
opened
a
door
in
her
bottom
once
it
began
the
thing
went
ahead
beyond
all
fighting
for
a
day
or
so
we
did
our
best
and
i
can
still
remember
in
my
limbs
and
back
the
pumping
the
fatigue
in
my
arms
and
the
memory
of
a
clear
little
dribble
of
water
that
jerked
as
one
pumped
and
of
knocking
off
and
the
being
awakened
to
go
on
again
and
of
fatigue
piling
up
upon
fatigue
at
last
we
ceased
to
think
of
anything
but
pumping
one
became
a
thing
of
torment
enchanted
doomed
to
pump
for
ever
i
still
remember
it
as
pure
relief
when
at
last
pollack
came
to
me
pipe
in
mouth
the
captain
says
the
damned
thing
s
going
down
right
now
he
remarked
chewing
his
mouthpiece
eh
good
idea
i
said
one
can
t
go
on
pumping
for
and
without
hurry
or
alacrity
sullenly
and
wearily
we
got
into
the
boats
and
pulled
away
from
the
maud
mary
until
we
were
clear
of
her
and
then
we
stayed
resting
on
our
oars
motionless
upon
a
glassy
sea
waiting
for
her
to
sink
we
were
all
silent
even
the
captain
was
silent
until
she
went
down
and
then
he
spoke
quite
mildly
in
an
undertone
dat
is
the
first
ship
i
haf
ever
lost
and
it
was
not
a
fair
game
it
wass
not
a
cargo
any
man
should
take
no
i
stared
at
the
slow
eddies
that
circled
above
the
departed
maud
mary
and
the
last
chance
of
business
organisations
i
felt
weary
beyond
emotion
i
thought
of
my
heroics
to
beatrice
and
my
uncle
of
my
prompt
i
ll
go
and
of
all
the
ineffectual
months
i
had
spent
after
this
headlong
decision
i
was
moved
to
laughter
at
myself
and
fate
but
the
captain
and
the
men
did
not
laugh
the
men
scowled
at
me
and
rubbed
their
sore
and
blistered
hands
and
set
themselves
to
row
as
all
the
world
knows
we
were
picked
up
by
the
union
castle
liner
portland
castle
the
hairdresser
aboard
was
a
wonderful
man
and
he
even
improvised
me
a
dress
suit
and
produced
a
clean
shirt
and
warm
underclothing
i
had
a
hot
bath
and
dressed
and
dined
and
drank
a
bottle
of
burgundy
now
i
said
are
there
any
newspapers
i
want
to
know
what
s
been
happening
in
the
my
steward
gave
me
what
he
had
but
i
landed
at
plymouth
still
largely
ignorant
of
the
course
of
events
i
shook
off
pollack
and
left
the
captain
and
mate
in
an
hotel
and
the
men
in
a
sailor
s
home
until
i
could
send
to
pay
them
off
and
i
made
my
way
to
the
station
the
newspapers
i
bought
the
placards
i
saw
all
england
indeed
resounded
to
my
uncle
s
bankruptcy
book
the
fourth
the
aftermath
of
chapter
the
first
the
stick
of
the
rocket
i
that
evening
i
talked
with
my
uncle
in
the
hardingham
for
the
last
time
the
atmosphere
of
the
place
had
altered
quite
shockingly
instead
of
the
crowd
of
importunate
courtiers
there
were
just
half
a
dozen
uninviting
men
journalists
waiting
for
an
interview
ropper
the
big
commissionaire
was
still
there
but
now
indeed
he
was
defending
my
uncle
from
something
more
than
intrusions
i
found
the
little
man
alone
in
the
inner
office
pretending
to
work
but
really
brooding
he
was
looking
yellow
and
deflated
lord
he
said
at
the
sight
of
me
you
re
lean
george
it
makes
that
scar
of
yours
show
we
regarded
each
other
gravely
for
a
time
quap
i
said
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
atlantic
there
s
some
bills
we
ve
got
to
pay
the
seen
the
papers
read
em
all
in
the
at
bay
he
said
i
been
at
bay
for
a
week
yelping
round
me
and
me
facing
the
music
i
m
feelin
a
bit
he
blew
and
wiped
his
glasses
my
stomack
isn
t
what
it
was
he
explained
one
finds
it
these
times
how
did
it
all
happen
george
your
marconigram
it
took
me
in
the
wind
a
i
told
him
concisely
he
nodded
to
the
paragraphs
of
my
narrative
and
at
the
end
he
poured
something
from
a
medicine
bottle
into
a
sticky
little
wineglass
and
drank
it
i
became
aware
of
the
presence
of
drugs
of
three
or
four
small
bottles
before
him
among
his
disorder
of
papers
of
a
faint
elusively
familiar
odour
in
the
room
yes
he
said
wiping
his
lips
and
recorking
the
bottle
you
ve
done
your
best
george
the
luck
s
been
against
he
reflected
bottle
in
hand
sometimes
the
luck
goes
with
you
and
sometimes
it
doesn
t
sometimes
it
doesn
t
and
then
where
are
you
grass
in
the
oven
fight
or
no
he
asked
a
few
questions
and
then
his
thoughts
came
back
to
his
own
urgent
affairs
i
tried
to
get
some
comprehensive
account
of
the
situation
from
him
but
he
would
not
give
it
oh
i
wish
i
d
had
you
i
wish
i
d
had
you
george
i
ve
had
a
lot
on
my
hands

headed
at
what

happened
oh
boom
infernal
yes
but
how
i
m
just
off
the
sea
it
d
worry
me
too
much
to
tell
you
now
it
s
tied
up
in
a
he
muttered
something
to
himself
and
mused
darkly
and
roused
himself
to
say
besides
you
d
better
keep
out
of
it
it
s
getting
tight
get
em
talking
go
down
to
crest
hill
and
fly
that
s
your
for
a
time
his
manner
set
free
queer
anxieties
in
my
brain
again
i
will
confess
that
that
mordet
island
nightmare
of
mine
returned
and
as
i
looked
at
him
his
hand
went
out
for
the
drug

napoleon

at
last
all
through
the
waterloo
campaign
his
stomach
it
wasn
t
a
stomach
worse
than
mine
no
the
mood
of
depression
passed
as
the
drug
worked
within
him
his
eyes
brightened
he
began
to
talk
big
he
began
to
dress
up
the
situation
for
my
eyes
to
recover
what
he
had
admitted
to
me
he
put
it
as
a
retreat

t
tell
all
my
plans
like
speaking
on
the
you
might
i
began
i
can
t
george
it
s
like
asking
to
look
at
some
embryo
you
got
to
wait
i
know
in
a
sort
of
way
i
know
but
to
tell
it
no
you
been
away
so
long
and
everything
s
got
my
perception
of
disastrous
entanglements
deepened
with
the
rise
of
his
spirits
it
was
evident
that
i
could
only
help
to
tie
him
up
in
whatever
net
was
weaving
round
his
mind
by
forcing
questions
and
explanations
upon
him
my
thoughts
flew
off
at
another
angle
how
s
aunt
susan
said
i
had
to
repeat
the
question
his
busy
whispering
lips
stopped
for
a
moment
and
he
answered
in
the
note
of
one
who
repeats
a
formula
she
d
like
to
be
in
the
battle
with
me
she
d
like
to
be
here
in
london
but
there
s
corners
i
got
to
turn
his
eye
rested
for
a
moment
on
the
little
bottle
beside
him
and
things
have
happened
you
might
go
down
now
and
talk
to
her
he
said
in
a
directer
voice
i
shall
be
down
night
i
he
looked
up
as
though
he
hoped
that
would
end
our
talk
for
the
i
asked
for
the
thank
god
for
george
ii
my
return
home
to
lady
grove
was
a
very
different
thing
from
what
i
had
anticipated
when
i
had
got
out
to
sea
with
my
load
of
quap
and
fancied
the
was
safe
within
my
grasp
as
i
walked
through
the
evening
light
along
the
downs
the
summer
stillness
seemed
like
the
stillness
of
something
newly
dead
there
were
no
lurking
workmen
any
more
no
cyclists
on
the
high
road
cessation
was
manifest
everywhere
there
had
been
i
learnt
from
my
aunt
a
touching
and
quite
voluntary
demonstration
when
the
crest
hill
work
had
come
to
an
end
and
the
men
had
drawn
their
last
pay
they
had
cheered
my
uncle
and
hooted
the
contractors
and
lord
boom
i
can
not
now
recall
the
manner
in
which
my
aunt
and
i
greeted
one
another
i
must
have
been
very
tired
there
but
whatever
impression
was
made
has
gone
out
of
my
memory
but
i
recall
very
clearly
how
we
sat
at
the
little
round
table
near
the
big
window
that
gave
on
the
terrace
and
dined
and
talked
i
remember
her
talking
of
my
uncle
she
asked
after
him
and
whether
he
seemed
well
i
wish
i
could
help
she
said
but
i
ve
never
helped
him
much
never
his
way
of
doing
things
was
never
mine
and
since
since
since
he
began
to
get
so
rich
he
s
kept
things
from
me
in
the
old
days
it
was
different
there
he
is
i
don
t
know
what
he
s
doing
he
won
t
have
me
near
him
more
s
kept
from
me
than
anyone
the
very
servants
won
t
let
me
know
they
try
and
stop
the
worst
of
the
papers
boom
s
things
from
coming
upstairs
i
suppose
they
ve
got
him
in
a
corner
george
poor
old
teddy
poor
old
adam
and
eve
we
are
ficial
receivers
with
flaming
swords
to
drive
us
out
of
our
garden
i
d
hoped
we
d
never
have
another
trek
well
anyway
it
won
t
be
crest
hill
but
it
s
hard
on
teddy
he
must
be
in
such
a
mess
up
there
poor
old
chap
i
suppose
we
can
t
help
him
i
suppose
we
d
only
worry
him
have
some
more
soup
george
while
there
is
some
the
next
day
was
one
of
those
days
of
strong
perception
that
stand
out
clear
in
one
s
memory
when
the
common
course
of
days
is
blurred
i
can
recall
now
the
awakening
in
the
large
familiar
room
that
was
always
kept
for
me
and
how
i
lay
staring
at
its
chairs
its
spaced
fine
furniture
its
glimpse
of
the
cedars
without
and
thought
that
all
this
had
to
end
i
have
never
been
greedy
for
money
i
have
never
wanted
to
be
rich
but
i
felt
now
an
immense
sense
of
impending
deprivation
i
read
the
newspapers
after
breakfast
i
and
my
aunt
together
and
then
i
walked
up
to
see
what
cothope
had
done
in
the
matter
of
lord
roberts
b
never
before
had
i
appreciated
so
acutely
the
ample
brightness
of
the
lady
grove
gardens
the
dignity
and
wide
peace
of
all
about
me
it
was
one
of
those
warm
mornings
in
late
may
that
have
won
all
the
glory
of
summer
without
losing
the
gay
delicacy
of
spring
the
shrubbery
was
bright
with
laburnum
and
lilac
the
beds
swarmed
with
daffodils
and
narcissi
and
with
lilies
of
the
valley
in
the
shade
i
went
along
the
paths
among
the
rhododendra
and
through
the
private
gate
into
the
woods
where
the
bluebells
and
common
orchid
were
in
profusion
never
before
had
i
tasted
so
completely
the
fine
sense
of
privilege
and
ownership
and
all
this
has
to
end
i
told
myself
all
this
has
to
end
neither
my
uncle
nor
i
had
made
any
provision
for
disaster
all
we
had
was
in
the
game
and
i
had
little
doubt
now
of
the
completeness
of
our
ruin
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
since
he
had
sent
me
that
wonderful
telegram
of
his
i
had
to
consider
that
common
anxiety
of
mankind
employment
i
had
to
come
off
my
magic
carpet
and
walk
once
more
in
the
world
and
suddenly
i
found
myself
at
the
cross
drives
where
i
had
seen
beatrice
for
the
first
time
after
so
many
years
it
is
strange
but
so
far
as
i
can
recollect
i
had
not
thought
of
her
once
since
i
had
landed
at
plymouth
no
doubt
she
had
filled
the
background
of
my
mind
but
i
do
not
remember
one
definite
clear
thought
i
had
been
intent
on
my
uncle
and
the
financial
collapse
it
came
like
a
blow
in
the
face
now
all
that
too
had
to
end
suddenly
i
was
filled
with
the
thought
of
her
and
a
great
longing
for
her
what
would
she
do
when
she
realised
our
immense
disaster
what
would
she
do
how
would
she
take
it
it
filled
me
with
astonishment
to
realise
how
little
i
could
tell
should
i
perhaps
presently
happen
upon
her
i
went
on
through
the
plantations
and
out
upon
the
downs
and
thence
i
saw
cothope
with
a
new
glider
of
his
own
design
soaring
down
wind
to
my
old
familiar
grounding
place
to
judge
by
its
long
rhythm
it
was
a
very
good
glider
like
cothope
s
cheek
thought
i
to
go
on
with
the
research
i
wonder
if
he
s
keeping
notes
but
all
this
will
have
to
he
was
sincerely
glad
to
see
me
it
s
been
a
rum
go
he
said
he
had
been
there
without
wages
for
a
month
a
man
forgotten
in
the
rush
of
events
i
just
stuck
on
and
did
what
i
could
with
the
stuff
i
got
a
bit
of
money
of
my
own
and
i
said
to
myself
well
here
you
are
with
the
gear
and
no
one
to
look
after
you
you
won
t
get
such
a
chance
again
my
boy
not
in
all
your
born
days
why
not
make
what
you
can
with
it
how
s
lord
roberts
b
cothope
lifted
his
eyebrows
i
ve
had
to
refrain
he
said
but
he
s
looking
very
gods
i
said
i
d
like
to
get
him
up
just
once
before
we
smash
you
read
the
papers
you
know
we
re
going
to
smash
oh
i
read
the
papers
it
s
scandalous
sir
such
work
as
ours
should
depend
on
things
like
that
you
and
i
ought
to
be
under
the
state
sir
if
you
ll
excuse
nothing
to
excuse
i
said
i
ve
always
been
a
socialist
of
a
sort
in
theory
let
s
go
and
have
a
look
at
him
how
is
he
deflated
just
about
quarter
full
that
last
oil
glaze
of
yours
holds
the
gas
something
beautiful
he
s
not
lost
a
cubic
metre
a
cothope
returned
to
socialism
as
we
went
toward
the
sheds
glad
to
think
you
re
a
socialist
sir
he
said
it
s
the
only
civilised
state
i
been
a
socialist
some
years
off
the
clarion
it
s
a
rotten
scramble
this
world
it
takes
the
things
we
make
and
invent
and
it
plays
the
silly
fool
with
em
we
scientific
people
we
ll
have
to
take
things
over
and
stop
all
this
financing
and
advertisement
and
that
it
s
too
silly
it
s
a
noosance
look
at
us
lord
roberts
b
even
in
his
partially
deflated
condition
in
his
shed
was
a
fine
thing
to
stare
up
at
i
stood
side
by
side
with
cothope
regarding
him
and
it
was
borne
in
upon
me
more
acutely
than
ever
that
all
this
had
to
end
i
had
a
feeling
just
like
the
feeling
of
a
boy
who
wants
to
do
wrong
that
i
would
use
up
the
stuff
while
i
had
it
before
the
creditors
descended
i
had
a
queer
fancy
too
i
remember
that
if
i
could
get
into
the
air
it
would
advertise
my
return
to
beatrice
we
ll
fill
her
i
said
concisely
it
s
all
ready
said
cothope
and
added
as
an
afterthought
unless
they
cut
off
the
i
worked
and
interested
myself
with
cothope
all
the
morning
and
for
a
time
forgot
my
other
troubles
but
the
thought
of
beatrice
flooded
me
slowly
and
steadily
it
became
an
unintelligent
sick
longing
to
see
her
i
felt
that
i
could
not
wait
for
the
filling
of
lord
roberts
b
that
i
must
hunt
her
up
and
see
her
soon
i
got
everything
forward
and
lunched
with
cothope
and
then
with
the
feeblest
excuses
left
him
in
order
to
prowl
down
through
the
woods
towards
bedley
corner
i
became
a
prey
to
wretched
hesitations
and
diffidence
ought
i
to
go
near
her
now
i
asked
myself
reviewing
all
the
social
abasements
of
my
early
years
at
last
about
five
i
called
at
the
dower
house
i
was
greeted
by
their
charlotte
with
a
forbidding
eye
and
a
cold
astonishment
both
beatrice
and
lady
osprey
were
out
there
came
into
my
head
some
prowling
dream
of
meeting
her
i
went
along
the
lane
towards
woking
the
lane
down
which
we
had
walked
five
months
ago
in
the
wind
and
rain
i
mooned
for
a
time
in
our
former
footsteps
then
swore
and
turned
back
across
the
fields
and
then
conceived
a
distaste
for
cothope
and
went
downward
at
last
i
found
myself
looking
down
on
the
huge
abandoned
masses
of
the
crest
hill
house
that
gave
my
mind
a
twist
into
a
new
channel
my
uncle
came
uppermost
again
what
a
strange
melancholy
emptiness
of
intention
that
stricken
enterprise
seemed
in
the
even
evening
sunlight
what
vulgar
magnificence
and
crudity
and
utter
absurdity
it
was
as
idiotic
as
the
pyramids
i
sat
down
on
the
stile
staring
at
it
as
though
i
had
never
seen
that
forest
of
scaffold
poles
that
waste
of
walls
and
bricks
and
plaster
and
shaped
stones
that
wilderness
of
broken
soil
and
wheeling
tracks
and
dumps
before
it
struck
me
suddenly
as
the
compactest
image
and
sample
of
all
that
passes
for
progress
of
all
the
spending
the
aimless
building
up
and
pulling
down
the
enterprise
and
promise
of
my
age
this
was
our
fruit
this
was
what
he
had
done
i
and
my
uncle
in
the
fashion
of
our
time
we
were
its
leaders
and
exponents
we
were
the
thing
it
most
flourishingly
produced
for
this
futility
in
its
end
for
an
epoch
of
such
futility
the
solemn
scroll
of
history
had
unfolded
great
god
i
cried
but
is
this
life
for
this
the
armies
drilled
for
this
the
law
was
administered
and
the
prisons
did
their
duty
for
this
the
millions
toiled
and
perished
in
suffering
in
order
that
a
few
of
us
should
build
palaces
we
never
finished
make
under
ponds
run
imbecile
walls
round
irrational
estates
scorch
about
the
world
in
devise
play
golf
and
a
dozen
such
foolish
games
of
ball
crowd
into
chattering
dinner
parties
gamble
and
make
our
lives
one
vast
dismal
spectacle
of
witless
waste
so
it
struck
me
then
and
for
a
time
i
could
think
of
no
other
interpretation
this
was
life
it
came
to
me
like
a
revelation
a
revelation
at
once
incredible
and
indisputable
of
the
abysmal
folly
of
our
being
iii
i
was
roused
from
such
thoughts
by
the
sound
of
footsteps
behind
me
i
turned
half
hopeful
so
foolish
is
a
lover
s
imagination
and
stopped
amazed
it
was
my
uncle
his
face
was
white
white
as
i
had
seen
it
in
my
dream
hullo
i
said
and
stared
why
aren
t
you
in
london
it
s
all
up
he
said
adjudicated
no
i
stared
at
him
for
a
moment
and
then
got
off
the
stile
we
stood
swaying
and
then
came
forward
with
a
weak
motion
of
his
arms
like
a
man
who
can
not
see
distinctly
and
caught
at
and
leant
upon
the
stile
for
a
moment
we
were
absolutely
still
he
made
a
clumsy
gesture
towards
the
great
futility
below
and
choked
i
discovered
that
his
face
was
wet
with
tears
that
his
wet
glasses
blinded
him
he
put
up
his
little
fat
hand
and
clawed
them
off
clumsily
felt
inefficiently
for
his
and
then
to
my
horror
as
he
clung
to
me
he
began
to
weep
aloud
this
little
old
worldworn
swindler
it
wasn
t
just
sobbing
or
shedding
tears
it
was
crying
as
a
child
cries
it
was
oh
terrible
it
s
cruel
he
blubbered
at
last
they
asked
me
questions
they
kep
asking
me
questions
he
sought
for
utterance
and
spluttered
the
bloody
bullies
he
shouted
the
bloody
he
ceased
to
weep
he
became
suddenly
rapid
and
explanatory
it
s
not
a
fair
game
george
they
tire
you
out
and
i
m

stomach

up
and
over
and
i
thought
i
d
live
in
that
place
george
and
die
a
lord
it
s
a
great
place
reely
an
imperial
if
anyone
has
the
sense
to
buy
it
and
finish
it
that
terrace
i
stood
thinking
him
over
look
here
i
said
what
s
that
about
a
warrant
are
you
sure
they
ll
get
a
warrant
i
m
sorry
uncle
but
what
have
you
done
haven
t
i
told
you
yes
but
they
won
t
do
very
much
to
you
for
that
they
ll
only
bring
you
up
for
the
rest
of
your
he
remained
silent
for
a
time
at
last
he
spoke
speaking
with
difficulty
it
s
worse
than
that
i
ve
done
something
they
re
bound
to
get
it
out
practically
they
have
got
it
what
writin
things
down
i
done
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
i
believe
he
felt
and
looked
ashamed
it
filled
me
with
remorse
to
see
him
suffer
so
we
ve
all
done
things
i
said
it
s
part
of
the
game
the
world
makes
us
play
if
they
want
to
arrest
you
and
you
ve
got
no
cards
in
your
hand
they
mustn
t
arrest
no
that
s
partly
why
i
went
to
richmond
but
i
never
thought
his
little
bloodshot
eyes
stared
at
crest
hill
that
chap
wittaker
wright
he
said
he
had
his
stuff
ready
i
haven
t
now
you
got
it
george
that
s
the
sort
of
hole
i
m
iv
that
memory
of
my
uncle
at
the
gate
is
very
clear
and
full
i
am
able
to
recall
even
the
undertow
of
my
thoughts
while
he
was
speaking
i
remember
my
pity
and
affection
for
him
in
his
misery
growing
and
stirring
within
me
my
realisation
that
at
any
risk
i
must
help
him
but
then
comes
indistinctness
again
i
was
beginning
to
act
i
know
i
persuaded
him
to
put
himself
in
my
hands
and
began
at
once
to
plan
and
do
i
think
that
when
we
act
most
we
remember
least
that
just
in
the
measure
that
the
impulse
of
our
impressions
translates
itself
into
schemes
and
movements
it
ceases
to
record
itself
in
memories
i
know
i
resolved
to
get
him
away
at
once
and
to
use
the
lord
roberts
b
in
effecting
that
it
was
clear
he
was
soon
to
be
a
hunted
man
and
it
seemed
to
me
already
unsafe
for
him
to
try
the
ordinary
continental
routes
in
his
flight
i
had
to
evolve
some
scheme
and
evolve
it
rapidly
how
we
might
drop
most
inconspicuously
into
the
world
across
the
water
my
resolve
to
have
one
flight
at
least
in
my
airship
fitted
with
this
like
hand
to
glove
it
seemed
to
me
we
might
be
able
to
cross
over
the
water
in
the
night
set
our
airship
adrift
and
turn
up
as
pedestrian
tourists
in
normandy
or
brittany
and
so
get
away
that
at
any
rate
was
my
ruling
idea
i
sent
off
cothope
with
a
dummy
note
to
woking
because
i
did
not
want
to
implicate
him
and
took
my
uncle
to
the
pavilion
i
went
down
to
my
aunt
and
made
a
clean
breast
of
the
situation
she
became
admirably
competent
we
went
into
his
and
ruthlessly
broke
his
locks
i
got
a
pair
of
brown
boots
a
tweed
suit
and
a
cap
of
his
and
indeed
a
plausible
walking
outfit
and
a
little
game
bag
for
his
pedestrian
gear
and
in
addition
a
big
motoring
overcoat
and
a
supply
of
rugs
to
add
to
those
i
had
at
the
pavilion
i
also
got
a
flask
of
brandy
and
she
made
sandwiches
i
don
t
remember
any
servants
appearing
and
i
forget
where
she
got
those
sandwiches
meanwhile
we
talked
afterwards
i
thought
with
what
a
sure
confidence
we
talked
to
each
other
what
s
he
done
she
said
d
you
mind
knowing
no
conscience
left
thank
god
i
think
forgery
there
was
just
a
little
pause
can
you
carry
this
bundle
she
asked
i
lifted
it
no
woman
ever
has
respected
the
law
ever
she
said
it
s
too
silly
the
things
it
lets
you
do
and
then
pulls
you
up
like
a
mad
nurse
minding
a
she
carried
some
rugs
for
me
through
the
shrubbery
in
the
darkling
they
ll
think
we
re
going
mooning
she
said
jerking
her
head
at
the
household
i
wonder
what
they
make
of
us
an
immense
droning
note
came
as
if
in
answer
to
that
it
startled
us
both
for
a
moment
the
dears
she
said
it
s
the
gong
for
dinner
but
i
wish
i
could
help
little
teddy
george
it
s
awful
to
think
of
him
there
with
hot
eyes
red
and
dry
and
i
know
the
sight
of
me
makes
him
feel
sore
things
i
said
george
if
i
could
have
seen
i
d
have
let
him
have
an
omnibusful
of
scrymgeours
i
cut
him
up
he
d
never
thought
i
meant
it
before
i
ll
help
all
i
can
i
turned
at
something
in
her
voice
and
got
a
moon
light
gleam
of
tears
upon
her
face
could
she
have
helped
she
asked
abruptly
she
that
my
god
i
cried
helped
those
things
don
t
help
tell
me
again
what
i
ought
to
do
she
said
after
a
silence
i
went
over
the
plans
i
had
made
for
communicating
and
the
things
i
thought
she
might
do
i
had
given
her
the
address
of
a
solicitor
she
might
put
some
trust
in
but
you
must
act
for
yourself
i
insisted
roughly
i
said
it
s
a
scramble
you
must
get
what
you
can
for
us
and
follow
as
you
she
nodded
she
came
right
up
to
the
pavilion
and
hovered
for
a
time
shyly
and
then
went
away
i
found
my
uncle
in
my
in
an
with
his
feet
upon
the
fender
of
the
gas
stove
which
he
had
lit
and
now
he
was
feebly
drunken
with
my
whisky
and
very
weary
in
body
and
spirit
and
inclined
to
be
cowardly
i
lef
my
drops
he
said
he
changed
his
clothes
slowly
and
unwillingly
i
had
to
bully
him
i
had
almost
to
shove
him
to
the
airship
and
tuck
him
up
upon
its
wicker
flat
i
made
but
a
clumsy
start
we
scraped
along
the
roof
of
the
shed
and
bent
a
van
of
the
propeller
and
for
a
time
i
hung
underneath
without
his
offering
a
hand
to
help
me
to
clamber
up
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
a
sort
of
anchoring
trolley
device
of
cothope
s
a
sort
of
slip
anchor
running
on
a
rail
we
should
never
have
got
clear
at
all
v
the
incidents
of
our
flight
in
lord
roberts
b
do
not
arrange
themselves
in
any
consecutive
order
to
think
of
that
adventure
is
like
dipping
haphazard
into
an
album
of
views
one
is
reminded
first
of
this
and
then
of
that
we
were
both
lying
down
on
a
horizontal
plate
of
basketwork
for
lord
roberts
b
had
none
of
the
elegant
accommodation
of
a
balloon
i
lay
forward
and
my
uncle
behind
me
in
such
a
position
that
he
could
see
hardly
anything
of
our
flight
we
were
protected
from
rolling
over
simply
by
netting
between
the
steel
stays
it
was
impossible
for
us
to
stand
up
at
all
we
had
either
to
lie
or
crawl
on
all
fours
over
the
basket
work
amidships
were
lockers
made
of
watson
s
aulite
material
and
between
these
it
was
that
i
had
put
my
uncle
wrapped
in
rugs
i
wore
sealskin
motoring
boots
and
gloves
and
a
motoring
fur
coat
over
my
tweeds
and
i
controlled
the
engine
by
bowden
wires
and
levers
forward
the
early
part
of
that
night
s
experience
was
made
up
of
warmth
of
moonlit
surrey
and
sussex
landscape
and
of
a
rapid
and
successful
flight
ascending
and
swooping
and
then
ascending
again
southward
i
could
not
watch
the
clouds
because
the
airship
overhung
me
i
could
not
see
the
stars
nor
gauge
the
meteorological
happening
but
it
was
fairly
clear
to
me
that
a
wind
shifting
between
north
and
northeast
was
gathering
strength
and
after
i
had
satisfied
myself
by
a
series
of
entirely
successful
expansions
and
contractions
of
the
real
of
lord
roberts
b
i
stopped
the
engine
to
save
my
petrol
and
let
the
monster
drift
checking
its
progress
by
the
dim
landscape
below
my
uncle
lay
quite
still
behind
me
saying
little
and
staring
in
front
of
him
and
i
was
left
to
my
own
thoughts
and
sensations
my
thoughts
whatever
they
were
have
long
since
faded
out
of
memory
and
my
sensations
have
merged
into
one
continuous
memory
of
an
countryside
lying
as
it
seemed
under
snow
with
square
patches
of
dimness
white
phantoms
of
roads
rents
and
pools
of
velvety
blackness
and
houses
i
remember
a
train
boring
its
way
like
a
hastening
caterpillar
of
fire
across
the
landscape
and
how
distinctly
i
heard
its
clatter
every
town
and
street
was
buttoned
with
street
lamps
i
came
quite
close
to
the
south
downs
near
lewes
and
all
the
lights
were
out
in
the
houses
and
the
people
gone
to
bed
we
left
the
land
a
little
to
the
east
of
brighton
and
by
that
time
brighton
was
well
abed
and
the
brightly
lit
deserted
then
i
let
out
the
gas
chamber
to
its
fullest
extent
and
rose
i
like
to
be
high
above
water
i
do
not
clearly
know
what
happened
in
the
night
i
think
i
must
have
dozed
and
probably
my
uncle
slept
i
remember
that
once
or
twice
i
heard
him
talking
in
an
eager
muffled
voice
to
himself
or
to
an
imaginary
court
but
there
can
be
no
doubt
the
wind
changed
right
round
into
the
east
and
that
we
were
carried
far
down
the
channel
without
any
suspicion
of
the
immense
leeway
we
were
making
i
remember
the
kind
of
stupid
perplexity
with
which
i
saw
the
dawn
breaking
over
a
grey
waste
of
water
below
and
realised
that
something
was
wrong
i
was
so
stupid
that
it
was
only
after
the
sunrise
i
really
noticed
the
trend
of
the
foam
caps
below
and
perceived
we
were
in
a
severe
easterly
gale
even
then
instead
of
heading
southeasterly
i
set
the
engine
going
headed
south
and
so
continued
a
course
that
must
needs
have
either
just
hit
ushant
or
carry
us
over
the
bay
of
biscay
i
thought
i
was
east
of
cherbourg
when
i
was
far
to
the
west
and
stopped
my
engine
in
that
belief
and
then
set
it
going
again
i
did
actually
sight
the
coast
of
brittany
to
the
southeast
in
the
late
afternoon
and
that
it
was
woke
me
up
to
the
gravity
of
our
position
i
discovered
it
by
accident
in
the
southeast
when
i
was
looking
for
it
in
the
southwest
i
turned
about
east
and
faced
the
wind
for
some
time
and
finding
i
had
no
chance
in
its
teeth
went
high
where
it
seemed
less
violent
and
tried
to
make
a
course
southeast
it
was
only
then
that
i
realised
what
a
gale
i
was
in
i
had
been
going
westward
and
perhaps
even
in
gusts
north
of
west
at
a
pace
of
fifty
or
sixty
miles
an
hour
then
i
began
what
i
suppose
would
be
called
a
fight
against
the
east
wind
one
calls
it
a
fight
but
it
was
really
almost
as
unlike
a
fight
as
plain
sewing
the
wind
tried
to
drive
me
westwardly
and
i
tried
to
get
as
much
as
i
could
eastwardly
with
the
wind
beating
and
rocking
us
irregularly
but
by
no
means
unbearably
for
about
twelve
hours
my
hope
lay
in
the
wind
abating
and
our
keeping
in
the
air
and
eastward
of
finisterre
until
it
did
and
the
chief
danger
was
the
exhaustion
of
our
petrol
it
was
a
long
and
anxious
and
almost
meditative
time
we
were
fairly
warm
and
only
slowly
getting
hungry
and
except
that
my
uncle
grumbled
a
little
and
produced
some
philosophical
reflections
and
began
to
fuss
about
having
a
temperature
we
talked
very
little
i
was
tired
and
sulky
and
chiefly
worried
about
the
engine
i
had
to
resist
a
tendency
to
crawl
back
and
look
at
it
i
did
not
care
to
risk
contracting
our
gas
chamber
for
fear
of
losing
gas
nothing
was
less
like
a
fight
i
know
that
in
popular
magazines
and
so
forth
all
such
occasions
as
this
are
depicted
in
terms
of
hysteria
captains
save
their
ships
engineers
complete
their
bridges
generals
conduct
their
battles
in
a
state
of
dancing
excitement
foaming
recondite
technicalities
at
the
lips
i
suppose
that
sort
of
thing
works
up
the
reader
but
so
far
as
it
professes
to
represent
reality
i
am
convinced
it
is
all
childish
nonsense
schoolboys
of
fifteen
girls
of
eighteen
and
literary
men
all
their
lives
may
have
these
squealing
fits
but
my
own
experience
is
that
most
exciting
scenes
are
not
exciting
and
most
of
the
urgent
moments
in
life
are
met
by
men
neither
i
nor
my
uncle
spent
the
night
in
ejaculations
nor
in
humorous
allusions
nor
any
of
these
things
we
remained
lumpish
my
uncle
stuck
in
his
place
and
grumbled
about
his
stomach
and
occasionally
rambled
off
into
expositions
of
his
financial
position
and
denunciations
of
neal
he
certainly
struck
out
one
or
two
good
phrases
for
neal
and
i
crawled
about
at
rare
intervals
in
a
vague
sort
of
way
and
grunted
and
our
basketwork
creaked
continually
and
the
wind
on
our
quarter
made
a
sort
of
ruffled
flapping
in
the
wall
of
the
gas
chamber
for
all
our
wraps
we
got
frightfully
cold
as
the
night
wore
on
i
must
have
dozed
and
it
was
still
dark
when
i
realised
with
a
start
that
we
were
nearly
due
south
of
and
a
long
way
from
a
lighthouse
standing
out
before
the
glow
of
some
great
town
and
then
that
the
thing
that
had
awakened
me
was
the
cessation
of
our
engine
and
that
we
were
driving
back
to
the
west
then
indeed
for
a
time
i
felt
the
grim
thrill
of
life
i
crawled
forward
to
the
cords
of
the
release
valves
made
my
uncle
crawl
forward
too
and
let
out
the
gas
until
we
were
falling
down
through
the
air
like
a
clumsy
glider
towards
the
vague
greyness
that
was
land
something
must
have
intervened
here
that
i
have
forgotten
i
saw
the
lights
of
bordeaux
when
it
was
quite
dark
a
nebulous
haze
against
black
of
that
i
am
reasonably
sure
but
certainly
our
fall
took
place
in
the
cold
uncertain
light
of
early
dawn
i
am
at
least
equally
sure
of
that
and
mimizan
near
where
we
dropped
is
fifty
miles
from
bordeaux
whose
harbour
lights
i
must
have
seen
i
remember
coming
down
at
last
with
a
curious
indifference
and
actually
rousing
myself
to
steer
but
the
actual
coming
to
earth
was
exciting
enough
i
remember
our
prolonged
dragging
landfall
and
the
difficulty
i
had
to
get
clear
and
how
a
gust
of
wind
caught
lord
roberts
b
as
my
uncle
stumbled
away
from
the
ropes
and
litter
and
dropped
me
heavily
and
threw
me
on
to
my
knees
then
came
the
realisation
that
the
monster
was
almost
consciously
disentangling
itself
for
escape
and
then
the
light
leap
of
its
rebound
the
rope
slipped
out
of
reach
of
my
hand
i
remember
running
in
a
salt
pool
in
hopeless
pursuit
of
the
airship
as
it
dragged
and
rose
seaward
and
how
only
after
it
had
escaped
my
uttermost
effort
to
recapture
it
did
i
realise
that
this
was
quite
the
best
thing
that
could
have
happened
it
drove
swiftly
over
the
sandy
dunes
lifting
and
falling
and
was
hidden
by
a
clump
of
windbitten
trees
then
it
reappeared
much
further
off
and
still
receding
it
soared
for
a
time
and
sank
slowly
and
after
that
i
saw
it
no
more
i
suppose
it
fell
into
the
sea
and
got
wetted
with
salt
water
and
heavy
and
so
became
deflated
and
sank
it
was
never
found
and
there
was
never
a
report
of
anyone
seeing
it
after
it
escaped
from
me
vi
but
if
i
find
it
hard
to
tell
the
story
of
our
long
flight
through
the
air
overseas
at
least
that
dawn
in
france
stands
cold
and
clear
and
full
i
see
again
almost
as
if
i
saw
once
more
with
my
bodily
eyes
the
ridges
of
sand
rising
behind
ridges
of
sand
grey
and
cold
and
with
an
insufficient
grass
i
feel
again
the
clear
cold
chill
of
dawn
and
hear
the
distant
barking
of
a
dog
i
find
myself
asking
again
what
shall
we
do
now
and
trying
to
scheme
with
brain
tired
beyond
measure
at
first
my
uncle
occupied
my
attention
he
was
shivering
a
good
deal
and
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
resist
my
desire
to
get
him
into
a
comfortable
bed
at
once
but
i
wanted
to
appear
plausibly
in
this
part
of
the
world
i
felt
it
would
not
do
to
turn
up
anywhere
at
dawn
and
rest
it
would
be
altogether
too
conspicuous
we
must
rest
until
the
day
was
well
advanced
and
then
appear
as
pedestrians
seeking
a
meal
i
gave
him
most
of
what
was
left
of
the
biscuits
emptied
our
flasks
and
advised
him
to
sleep
but
at
first
it
was
too
cold
albeit
i
wrapped
the
big
fur
rug
around
him
i
was
struck
now
by
the
flushed
weariness
of
his
face
and
the
look
of
age
the
grey
stubble
on
his
unshaved
chin
gave
him
he
sat
crumpled
up
shivering
and
coughing
munching
reluctantly
but
drinking
eagerly
and
whimpering
a
little
a
dreadfully
pitiful
figure
to
me
but
we
had
to
go
through
with
it
there
was
no
way
out
for
us
presently
the
sun
rose
over
the
pines
and
the
sand
grew
rapidly
warm
my
uncle
had
done
eating
and
sat
with
his
wrists
resting
on
his
knees
the
most
hopeless
looking
of
lost
souls
i
m
ill
he
said
i
m
damnably
ill
i
can
feel
it
in
my
skin
then
it
was
horrible
to
me
he
cried
i
ought
to
be
in
bed
i
ought
to
be
in
bed
instead
of
flying
about
and
suddenly
he
burst
into
tears
i
stood
up
go
to
sleep
man
i
said
and
took
the
rug
from
him
and
spread
it
out
and
rolled
him
up
in
it
it
s
all
very
well
he
protested
i
m
not
young
enough
lift
up
your
head
i
interrupted
and
put
his
knapsack
under
it
they
ll
catch
us
here
just
as
much
as
in
an
inn
he
grumbled
and
then
lay
still
presently
after
a
long
time
i
perceived
he
was
asleep
his
breath
came
with
peculiar
wheezings
and
every
now
and
again
he
would
cough
i
was
very
stiff
and
tired
myself
and
perhaps
i
dozed
i
don
t
remember
i
remember
only
sitting
as
it
seemed
nigh
interminably
beside
him
too
weary
even
to
think
in
that
sandy
desolation
no
one
came
near
us
no
creature
not
even
a
dog
i
roused
myself
at
last
feeling
that
it
was
vain
to
seek
to
seem
other
than
abnormal
and
with
an
effort
that
was
like
lifting
a
sky
of
lead
we
made
our
way
through
the
wearisome
sand
to
a
farmhouse
there
i
feigned
even
a
more
insufficient
french
than
i
possess
naturally
and
let
it
appear
that
we
were
pedestrians
from
biarritz
who
had
lost
our
way
along
the
shore
and
got
benighted
this
explained
us
pretty
well
i
thought
and
we
got
most
heartening
coffee
and
a
cart
to
a
little
roadside
station
my
uncle
grew
more
and
more
manifestly
ill
with
every
stage
of
our
journey
i
got
him
to
bayonne
where
he
refused
at
first
to
eat
and
was
afterwards
very
sick
and
then
took
him
shivering
and
collapsed
up
a
little
branch
line
to
a
frontier
place
called
luzon
gare
we
found
one
homely
inn
with
two
small
bedrooms
kept
by
a
kindly
basque
woman
i
got
him
to
bed
and
that
night
shared
his
room
and
after
an
hour
or
so
of
sleep
he
woke
up
in
a
raging
fever
and
with
a
wandering
mind
cursing
neal
and
repeating
long
inaccurate
lists
of
figures
he
was
manifestly
a
case
for
a
doctor
and
in
the
morning
we
got
one
in
he
was
a
young
man
from
montpelier
just
beginning
to
practise
and
very
mysterious
and
technical
and
modern
and
unhelpful
he
spoke
of
cold
and
exposure
and
la
grippe
and
pneumonia
he
gave
many
explicit
and
difficult
directions
i
perceived
it
devolved
upon
me
to
organise
nursing
and
a
i
installed
a
religieuse
in
the
second
bedroom
of
the
inn
and
took
a
room
for
myself
in
the
inn
of
port
de
luzon
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
vii
and
now
my
story
converges
on
what
in
that
queer
corner
of
refuge
out
of
the
world
was
destined
to
be
my
uncle
s
deathbed
there
is
a
background
of
the
pyrenees
of
blue
hills
and
sunlit
houses
of
the
old
castle
of
luzon
and
a
noisy
cascading
river
and
for
a
foreground
the
dim
stuffy
room
whose
windows
both
the
religieuse
and
hostess
conspired
to
shut
with
its
waxed
floor
its
bed
its
characteristically
french
chairs
and
fireplace
its
champagne
bottles
and
dirty
basins
and
used
towels
and
packets
of
somatose
on
the
table
and
in
the
sickly
air
of
the
confined
space
in
behind
the
curtains
of
the
bed
lay
my
little
uncle
with
an
effect
of
being
enthroned
and
secluded
or
sat
up
or
writhed
and
tossed
in
his
last
dealings
of
life
one
went
and
drew
back
the
edge
of
the
curtains
if
one
wanted
to
speak
to
him
or
look
at
him
usually
he
was
propped
up
against
pillows
because
so
he
breathed
more
easily
he
slept
hardly
at
all
i
have
a
confused
memory
of
vigils
and
mornings
and
afternoons
spent
by
that
bedside
and
how
the
religieuse
hovered
about
me
and
how
meek
and
good
and
inefficient
she
was
and
how
horribly
black
were
her
nails
other
figures
come
and
go
and
particularly
the
doctor
a
young
man
plumply
rococo
in
bicycling
dress
with
fine
waxen
features
a
little
pointed
beard
and
the
long
black
frizzy
hair
and
huge
tie
of
a
minor
poet
bright
and
and
irrelevant
are
memories
of
the
basque
hostess
of
my
uncle
s
inn
and
of
the
family
of
spanish
people
who
entertained
me
and
prepared
the
most
amazingly
elaborate
meals
for
me
with
soup
and
salad
and
chicken
and
remarkable
sweets
they
were
all
very
kind
and
sympathetic
people
systematically
so
and
constantly
without
attracting
attention
i
was
trying
to
get
newspapers
from
home
my
uncle
is
central
to
all
these
impressions
i
have
tried
to
make
you
picture
him
time
after
time
as
the
young
man
of
the
wimblehurst
chemist
s
shop
as
the
shabby
assistant
in
tottenham
court
road
as
the
adventurer
of
the
early
days
of
as
the
confident
preposterous
plutocrat
and
now
i
have
to
tell
of
him
strangely
changed
under
the
shadow
of
oncoming
death
with
his
skin
lax
and
yellow
and
glistening
with
sweat
his
eyes
large
and
glassy
his
countenance
unfamiliar
through
the
growth
of
a
beard
his
nose
pinched
and
thin
never
had
he
looked
so
small
as
now
and
he
talked
to
me
in
a
whispering
strained
voice
of
great
issues
of
why
his
life
had
been
and
whither
he
was
going
poor
little
man
that
last
phase
is
as
it
were
disconnected
from
all
the
other
phases
it
was
as
if
he
crawled
out
from
the
ruins
of
his
career
and
looked
about
him
before
he
died
for
he
had
quite
states
in
the
intervals
of
his
delirium
he
knew
he
was
almost
certainly
dying
in
a
way
that
took
the
burthen
of
his
cares
off
his
mind
there
was
no
more
neal
to
face
no
more
flights
or
evasions
no
punishments
it
has
been
a
great
career
george
he
said
but
i
shall
be
glad
to
rest
glad
to
rest
glad
to
his
mind
ran
rather
upon
his
career
and
usually
i
am
glad
to
recall
with
a
note
of
satisfaction
and
approval
in
his
delirious
phases
he
would
most
often
exaggerate
this
and
talk
of
his
splendours
he
would
pluck
at
the
sheet
and
stare
before
him
and
whisper
fragments
of
sentences

is

great

it
was
hard
at
times
to
tell
when
his
sane
talk
ceased
and
his
delirium
began
the
secret
springs
of
his
life
the
vain
imaginations
were
revealed
i
sometimes
think
that
all
the
life
of
man
sprawls
abed
careless
and
unkempt
until
it
must
needs
clothe
and
wash
itself
and
come
forth
seemly
in
act
and
speech
for
the
encounter
with
one
s
i
suspect
that
all
things
unspoken
in
our
souls
partake
somewhat
of
the
laxity
of
delirium
and
dementia
certainly
from
those
slimy
tormented
lips
above
the
bristling
grey
beard
came
nothing
but
dreams
and
disconnected
fancies
sometimes
he
raved
about

think

sometimes

it
s
too
long
george
too
long
and
too
cold
i
m
too
old
a
man
too
old
for
this
sort
of
thing
you
know
you
re
not
saving
you
re
killing
towards
the
end
it
became
evident
our
identity
was
discovered
i
found
the
press
and
especially
boom
s
section
of
it
had
made
a
sort
of
hue
and
cry
for
us
sent
special
commissioners
to
hunt
for
us
and
though
none
of
these
emissaries
reached
us
until
my
uncle
was
dead
one
felt
the
forewash
of
that
storm
of
energy
the
thing
got
into
the
popular
french
press
people
became
curious
in
their
manner
towards
us
and
a
number
of
fresh
faces
appeared
about
the
weak
little
struggle
that
went
on
in
the
closeness
behind
the
curtains
of
the
bed
the
young
doctor
insisted
on
consultations
and
a
came
up
from
biarritz
and
suddenly
odd
people
with
questioning
eyes
began
to
poke
in
with
inquiries
and
help
though
nothing
was
said
i
could
feel
that
we
were
no
longer
regarded
as
simple
tourists
about
me
as
i
went
i
perceived
almost
as
though
it
trailed
visibly
the
prestige
of
finance
and
a
criminal
notoriety
local
personages
of
a
plump
and
prosperous
quality
appeared
in
the
inn
making
inquiries
the
luzon
priest
became
helpful
people
watched
our
window
and
stared
at
me
as
i
went
to
and
fro
and
then
we
had
a
raid
from
a
little
english
clergyman
and
his
amiable
capable
wife
in
severely
anglican
blacks
who
swooped
down
upon
us
like
virtuous
but
resolute
vultures
from
the
adjacent
village
of
saint
jean
de
pollack
the
clergyman
was
one
of
those
odd
types
that
oscillate
between
remote
country
towns
in
england
and
the
conduct
of
english
church
services
on
mutual
terms
in
enterprising
hotels
abroad
a
tremulous
obstinate
little
being
with
sporadic
hairs
upon
his
face
spectacles
a
red
button
nose
and
aged
black
raiment
he
was
evidently
enormously
impressed
by
my
uncle
s
monetary
greatness
and
by
his
own
inkling
of
our
identity
and
he
shone
and
brimmed
over
with
tact
and
fussy
helpfulness
he
was
eager
to
share
the
watching
of
the
bedside
with
me
he
proffered
services
with
both
hands
and
as
i
was
now
getting
into
touch
with
affairs
in
london
again
and
trying
to
disentangle
the
gigantic
details
of
the
smash
from
the
papers
i
had
succeeded
in
getting
from
biarritz
i
accepted
his
offers
pretty
generously
and
began
the
studies
in
modern
finance
that
lay
before
me
i
had
got
so
out
of
touch
with
the
old
traditions
of
religion
that
i
overlooked
the
manifest
possibility
of
his
attacking
my
poor
sinking
vestiges
of
an
uncle
with
theological
solicitudes
my
attention
was
called
to
that
however
very
speedily
by
a
polite
but
urgent
quarrel
between
himself
and
the
basque
landlady
as
to
the
necessity
of
her
hanging
a
cheap
crucifix
in
the
shadow
over
the
bed
where
it
might
catch
my
uncle
s
eye
where
indeed
i
found
it
had
caught
his
eye
good
lord
i
cried
is
that
still
going
on
that
night
the
little
clergyman
watched
and
in
the
small
hours
he
raised
a
false
alarm
that
my
uncle
was
dying
and
made
an
extraordinary
fuss
he
raised
the
house
i
shall
never
forget
that
scene
i
think
which
began
with
a
tapping
at
my
bedroom
door
just
after
i
had
fallen
asleep
and
his
voice
if
you
want
to
see
your
uncle
before
he
goes
you
must
come
the
stuffy
little
room
was
crowded
when
i
reached
it
and
lit
by
three
flickering
candles
i
felt
i
was
back
in
the
eighteenth
century
there
lay
my
poor
uncle
amidst
indescribably
tumbled
bedclothes
weary
of
life
beyond
measure
weary
and
rambling
and
the
little
clergyman
trying
to
hold
his
hand
and
his
attention
and
repeating
over
and
over
again
mr
ponderevo
ponderevo
it
is
all
right
it
is
all
right
only
believe
believe
on
me
and
ye
shall
be
saved
close
at
hand
was
the
doctor
with
one
of
those
cruel
and
idiotic
injection
needles
modern
science
puts
in
the
hands
of
these
young
men
keeping
my
uncle
flickeringly
alive
for
no
reason
whatever
the
religieuse
hovered
sleepily
in
the
background
with
an
overdue
and
neglected
dose
in
addition
the
landlady
had
not
only
got
up
herself
but
roused
an
aged
crone
of
a
mother
and
a
partially
imbecile
husband
and
there
was
also
a
fattish
stolid
man
in
grey
alpaca
with
an
air
of
importance
who
he
was
and
how
he
got
there
i
don
t
know
i
rather
fancy
the
doctor
explained
him
to
me
in
french
i
did
not
understand
and
they
were
all
there
wearily
nocturnal
hastily
and
carelessly
dressed
intent
upon
the
life
that
flickered
and
sank
making
a
public
and
curious
show
of
its
going
queer
shapes
of
human
beings
lit
by
three
uncertain
candles
and
every
soul
of
them
keenly
and
avidly
resolved
to
be
in
at
the
death
the
doctor
stood
the
others
were
all
sitting
on
chairs
the
landlady
had
brought
in
and
arranged
for
them
and
my
uncle
spoilt
the
climax
and
did
not
die
i
replaced
the
little
clergyman
on
the
chair
by
the
bedside
and
he
hovered
about
the
room
i
think
he
whispered
to
me
mysteriously
as
he
gave
place
to
me
i
believe
it
is
well
with
i
heard
him
trying
to
render
the
stock
phrases
of
low
church
piety
into
french
for
the
benefit
of
the
stolid
man
in
grey
alpaca
then
he
knocked
a
glass
off
the
table
and
scrabbled
for
the
fragments
from
the
first
i
doubted
the
theory
of
an
immediate
death
i
consulted
the
doctor
in
urgent
whispers
i
turned
round
to
get
champagne
and
nearly
fell
over
the
clergyman
s
legs
he
was
on
his
knees
at
the
additional
chair
the
basque
landlady
had
got
on
my
arrival
and
he
was
praying
aloud
oh
heavenly
father
have
mercy
on
this
thy
child
i
hustled
him
up
and
out
of
the
way
and
in
another
minute
he
was
down
at
another
chair
praying
again
and
barring
the
path
of
the
religieuse
who
had
found
me
the
corkscrew
something
put
into
my
head
that
tremendous
blasphemy
of
carlyle
s
about
the
last
mew
of
a
drowning
he
found
a
third
chair
vacant
presently
it
was
as
if
he
was
playing
a
game
good
heavens
i
said
we
must
clear
these
people
out
and
with
a
certain
urgency
i
did
i
had
a
temporary
lapse
of
memory
and
forgot
all
my
french
i
drove
them
out
mainly
by
gesture
and
opened
the
window
to
the
universal
horror
i
intimated
the
death
scene
was
postponed
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
my
uncle
did
not
die
until
the
next
night
i
did
not
let
the
little
clergyman
come
near
him
again
and
i
was
watchful
for
any
sign
that
his
mind
had
been
troubled
but
he
made
none
he
talked
once
about
that
parson
didn
t
bother
you
i
asked
wanted
something
he
said
i
kept
silence
listening
keenly
to
his
mutterings
i
understood
him
to
say
they
wanted
too
his
face
puckered
like
a
child
s
going
to
cry
you
can
t
get
a
safe
six
per
he
said
i
had
for
a
moment
a
wild
suspicion
that
those
urgent
talks
had
not
been
altogether
spiritual
but
that
i
think
was
a
quite
unworthy
and
unjust
suspicion
the
little
clergyman
was
as
simple
and
honest
as
the
day
my
uncle
was
simply
generalising
about
his
class
but
it
may
have
been
these
talks
that
set
loose
some
long
dormant
string
of
ideas
in
my
uncle
s
brain
ideas
the
things
of
this
world
had
long
suppressed
and
hidden
altogether
near
the
end
he
suddenly
became
clearminded
and
lucid
albeit
very
weak
and
his
voice
was
little
but
clear
george
he
said
i
m
here
i
said
close
beside
george
you
have
always
been
responsible
for
the
science
george
you
know
better
than
i
do
is
is
it
proved
what
proved
either
way
i
don
t
death
ends
all
after
so
much
such
splendid
beginnin
s
somewhere
i
stared
at
him
amazed
his
sunken
eyes
were
very
grave
what
do
you
expect
i
said
in
wonder
he
would
not
answer
aspirations
he
whispered
he
fell
into
a
broken
monologue
regardless
of
me
trailing
clouds
of
glory
he
said
and
poet
was
always
hard
for
a
long
time
there
was
silence
then
he
made
a
gesture
that
he
wished
to
speak
seems
to
me
george
i
bent
my
head
down
and
he
tried
to
lift
his
hand
to
my
shoulder
i
raised
him
a
little
on
his
pillows
and
listened
it
seems
to
me
george
always
there
must
be
something
in
me
that
won
t
he
looked
at
me
as
though
the
decision
rested
with
me
i
think
he
said
then
for
a
moment
his
mind
wandered
just
a
little
link
he
whispered
almost
pleadingly
and
lay
quite
still
but
presently
he
was
uneasy
again
some
other
world
perhaps
i
said
who
knows
some
other
not
the
same
scope
for
enterprise
i
said
he
became
silent
i
sat
leaning
down
to
him
and
following
out
my
own
thoughts
and
presently
the
religieuse
resumed
her
periodic
conflict
with
the
window
fastening
for
a
time
he
struggled
for
breath
it
seemed
such
nonsense
that
he
should
have
to
suffer
so
poor
silly
little
man
george
he
whispered
and
his
weak
little
hand
came
out
perhaps
he
said
no
more
but
i
perceived
from
the
expression
of
his
eyes
that
he
thought
the
question
had
been
put
yes
i
think
so
i
said
stoutly
aren
t
you
sure
oh
practically
sure
said
i
and
i
think
he
tried
to
squeeze
my
hand
and
there
i
sat
holding
his
hand
tight
and
trying
to
think
what
seeds
of
immortality
could
be
found
in
all
his
being
what
sort
of
ghost
there
was
in
him
to
wander
out
into
the
bleak
immensities
queer
fancies
came
to
me
he
lay
still
for
a
long
time
save
for
a
brief
struggle
or
so
for
breath
and
ever
and
again
i
wiped
his
mouth
and
lips
i
fell
into
a
pit
of
thought
i
did
not
remark
at
first
the
change
that
was
creeping
over
his
face
he
lay
back
on
his
pillow
made
a
faint
zzzing
sound
that
ceased
and
presently
and
quite
quietly
he
died
greatly
comforted
by
my
assurance
i
do
not
know
when
he
died
his
hand
relaxed
insensibly
suddenly
with
a
start
with
a
shock
i
found
that
his
mouth
had
fallen
open
and
that
he
was
dead
viii
it
was
dark
night
when
i
left
his
deathbed
and
went
back
to
my
own
inn
down
the
straggling
street
of
luzon
that
return
to
my
inn
sticks
in
my
memory
also
as
a
thing
apart
as
an
experience
apart
within
was
a
subdued
bustle
of
women
a
flitting
of
lights
and
the
doing
of
petty
offices
to
that
queer
exhausted
thing
that
had
once
been
my
active
and
urgent
little
uncle
for
me
those
offices
were
irksome
and
impertinent
i
slammed
the
door
and
went
out
into
the
warm
foggy
drizzle
of
the
village
street
lit
by
blurred
specks
of
light
in
great
voids
of
darkness
and
never
a
soul
abroad
that
warm
veil
of
fog
produced
an
effect
of
vast
seclusion
the
very
houses
by
the
roadside
peered
through
it
as
if
from
another
world
the
stillness
of
the
night
was
marked
by
an
occasional
remote
baying
of
dogs
all
these
people
kept
dogs
because
of
the
near
neighbourhood
of
the
frontier
death
it
was
one
of
those
rare
seasons
of
relief
when
for
a
little
time
one
walks
a
little
outside
of
and
beside
life
i
felt
as
i
sometimes
feel
after
the
end
of
a
play
i
saw
the
whole
business
of
my
uncle
s
life
as
something
familiar
and
completed
it
was
done
like
a
play
one
leaves
like
a
book
one
closes
i
thought
of
the
push
and
the
promotions
the
noise
of
london
the
crowded
various
company
of
people
through
which
our
lives
had
gone
the
public
meetings
the
excitements
the
dinners
and
disputations
and
suddenly
it
appeared
to
me
that
none
of
these
things
existed
it
came
to
me
like
a
discovery
that
none
of
these
things
existed
before
and
after
i
have
thought
and
called
life
a
phantasmagoria
but
never
have
i
felt
its
truth
as
i
did
that
night
we
had
parted
we
two
who
had
kept
company
so
long
had
parted
but
there
was
i
knew
no
end
to
him
or
me
he
had
died
a
dream
death
and
ended
a
dream
his
pain
dream
was
over
it
seemed
to
me
almost
as
though
i
had
died
too
what
did
it
matter
since
it
was
unreality
all
of
it
the
pain
and
desire
the
beginning
and
the
end
there
was
no
reality
except
this
solitary
road
this
quite
solitary
road
along
which
one
went
rather
puzzled
rather
tired
part
of
the
fog
became
a
big
mastiff
that
came
towards
me
and
stopped
and
slunk
round
me
growling
barked
gruffly
and
shortly
and
presently
became
fog
again
my
mind
swayed
back
to
the
ancient
beliefs
and
fears
of
our
race
my
doubts
and
disbeliefs
slipped
from
me
like
a
loosely
fitting
garment
i
wondered
quite
simply
what
dogs
bayed
about
the
path
of
that
other
walker
in
the
darkness
what
shapes
what
lights
it
might
be
loomed
about
him
as
he
went
his
way
from
our
last
encounter
on
earth
along
the
paths
that
are
real
and
the
way
that
endures
for
ever
ix
last
belated
figure
in
that
grouping
round
my
uncle
s
deathbed
is
my
aunt
when
it
was
beyond
all
hope
that
my
uncle
could
live
i
threw
aside
whatever
concealment
remained
to
us
and
telegraphed
directly
to
her
but
she
came
too
late
to
see
him
living
she
saw
him
calm
and
still
strangely
unlike
his
habitual
garrulous
animation
an
unfamiliar
inflexibility
it
isn
t
like
him
she
whispered
awed
by
this
alien
dignity
i
remember
her
chiefly
as
she
talked
and
wept
upon
the
bridge
below
the
old
castle
we
had
got
rid
of
some
amateurish
reporters
from
biarritz
and
had
walked
together
in
the
hot
morning
sunshine
down
through
port
luzon
there
for
a
time
we
stood
leaning
on
the
parapet
of
the
bridge
and
surveying
the
distant
peeks
the
rich
blue
masses
of
the
pyrenees
for
a
long
time
we
said
nothing
and
then
she
began
talking
life
s
a
rum
go
george
she
began
who
would
have
thought
when
i
used
to
darn
your
stockings
at
old
wimblehurst
that
this
would
be
the
end
of
the
story
it
seems
far
away
now
that
little
shop
his
and
my
first
home
the
glow
of
the
bottles
the
big
coloured
bottles
do
you
remember
how
the
light
shone
on
the
mahogany
drawers
the
little
gilt
letters
ol
amjig
and
snap
i
can
remember
it
all
bright
and
shining
like
a
dutch
picture
real
and
yesterday
and
here
we
are
in
a
dream
you
a
man
and
me
an
old
woman
george
and
poor
little
teddy
who
used
to
rush
about
and
talk
making
that
noise
he
did
oh
she
choked
and
the
tears
flowed
unrestrained
she
wept
and
i
was
glad
to
see
her
weeping
she
stood
leaning
over
the
bridge
her
handkerchief
gripped
in
her
clenched
hand
just
an
hour
in
the
old
shop
again
and
him
talking
before
things
got
done
before
they
got
hold
of
him
and
fooled
him
men
oughtn
t
to
be
so
tempted
with
business
and
things
they
didn
t
hurt
him
george
she
asked
suddenly
for
a
moment
i
was
puzzled
here
i
mean
she
said
no
i
lied
stoutly
suppressing
the
memory
of
that
foolish
injection
needle
i
had
caught
the
young
doctor
using
i
wonder
george
if
they
ll
let
him
talk
in
heaven
she
faced
me
oh
george
dear
my
heart
aches
and
i
don
t
know
what
i
say
and
do
give
me
your
arm
to
lean
on
it
s
good
to
have
you
dear
and
lean
upon
you
yes
i
know
you
care
for
me
that
s
why
i
m
talking
we
ve
always
loved
one
another
and
never
said
anything
about
it
and
you
understand
and
i
understand
but
my
heart
s
torn
to
pieces
by
this
torn
to
rags
and
things
drop
out
i
ve
kept
in
it
it
s
true
he
wasn
t
a
husband
much
for
me
at
the
last
but
he
was
my
child
george
he
was
my
child
and
all
my
children
my
silly
child
and
life
has
knocked
him
about
for
me
and
i
ve
never
had
a
say
in
the
matter
never
a
say
it
s
puffed
him
up
and
smashed
him
like
an
old
bag
under
my
eyes
i
was
clever
enough
to
see
it
and
not
clever
enough
to
prevent
it
and
all
i
could
do
was
to
jeer
i
ve
had
to
make
what
i
could
of
it
like
most
people
like
most
of
us
but
it
wasn
t
fair
george
it
wasn
t
fair
life
and
death
great
serious
things
why
couldn
t
they
leave
him
alone
and
his
lies
and
ways
if
we
could
see
the
lightness
of
it
why
couldn
t
they
leave
him
alone
she
repeated
in
a
whisper
as
we
went
towards
the
inn
chapter
the
second
love
among
the
wreckage
i
when
i
came
back
i
found
that
my
share
in
the
escape
and
death
of
my
uncle
had
made
me
for
a
time
a
notorious
and
even
popular
character
for
two
weeks
i
was
kept
in
london
facing
the
music
as
he
would
have
said
and
making
things
easy
for
my
aunt
and
i
still
marvel
at
the
consideration
with
which
the
world
treated
me
for
now
it
was
open
and
manifest
that
i
and
my
uncle
were
no
more
than
specimens
of
a
modern
species
of
brigand
wasting
the
savings
of
the
public
out
of
the
sheer
wantonness
of
enterprise
i
think
that
in
a
way
his
death
produced
a
reaction
in
my
favour
and
my
flight
of
which
some
particulars
now
appeared
stuck
in
the
popular
imagination
it
seemed
a
more
daring
and
difficult
feat
than
it
was
and
i
couldn
t
very
well
write
to
the
papers
to
sustain
my
private
estimate
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
men
infinitely
prefer
the
appearance
of
dash
and
enterprise
to
simple
honesty
no
one
believed
i
was
not
an
arch
plotter
in
his
financing
yet
they
favoured
me
i
even
got
permission
from
the
trustee
to
occupy
my
chalet
for
a
fortnight
while
i
cleared
up
the
mass
of
papers
calculations
notes
of
work
drawings
and
the
like
that
i
left
in
disorder
when
i
started
on
that
impulsive
raid
upon
the
mordet
quap
heaps
i
was
there
alone
i
got
work
for
cothope
with
the
ilchesters
for
whom
i
now
build
these
destroyers
they
wanted
him
at
once
and
he
was
short
of
money
so
i
let
him
go
and
managed
very
philosophically
by
myself
but
i
found
it
hard
to
fix
my
attention
on
aeronautics
i
had
been
away
from
the
work
for
a
full
and
more
a
crowded
with
intense
disconcerting
things
for
a
time
my
brain
refused
these
fine
problems
of
balance
and
adjustment
altogether
it
wanted
to
think
about
my
uncle
s
dropping
jaw
my
aunt
s
reluctant
tears
about
dead
negroes
and
pestilential
swamps
about
the
evident
realities
of
cruelty
and
pain
about
life
and
death
moreover
it
was
weary
with
the
frightful
pile
of
figures
and
documents
at
the
hardingham
a
task
to
which
this
raid
to
lady
grove
was
simply
an
interlude
and
there
was
beatrice
on
the
second
morning
as
i
sat
out
upon
the
veranda
recalling
memories
and
striving
in
vain
to
attend
to
some
too
succinct
pencil
notes
of
cothope
s
beatrice
rode
up
suddenly
from
behind
the
pavilion
and
pulled
rein
and
became
still
beatrice
a
little
flushed
from
riding
and
sitting
on
a
big
black
horse
i
did
not
instantly
rise
i
stared
at
her
you
i
said
she
looked
at
me
steadily
me
she
said
i
did
not
trouble
about
any
civilities
i
stood
up
and
asked
point
blank
a
question
that
came
into
my
head
whose
horse
is
that
i
said
she
looked
me
in
the
eyes
carnaby
s
she
answered
how
did
you
get
here
this
way
the
wall
s
down
already
a
great
bit
of
it
between
the
and
you
rode
through
and
got
here
by
chance
i
saw
you
yesterday
and
i
rode
over
to
see
i
had
now
come
close
to
her
and
stood
looking
up
into
her
face
i
m
a
mere
vestige
i
said
she
made
no
answer
but
remained
regarding
me
steadfastly
with
a
curious
air
of
proprietorship
you
know
i
m
the
living
survivor
now
of
the
great
smash
i
m
rolling
and
dropping
down
through
all
the
scaffolding
of
the
social
system
it
s
all
a
chance
whether
i
roll
out
free
at
the
bottom
or
go
down
a
crack
into
the
darkness
out
of
sight
for
a
year
or
the
sun
she
remarked
irrelevantly
has
burnt
you
i
m
getting
she
swung
herself
down
into
my
arms
and
stood
beside
me
face
to
face
where
s
cothope
she
asked
her
eyes
flitted
to
the
pavilion
and
back
to
me
we
stood
close
together
extraordinarily
intimate
and
extraordinarily
apart
i
ve
never
seen
this
cottage
of
yours
she
said
and
i
want
she
flung
the
bridle
of
her
horse
round
the
veranda
post
and
i
helped
her
tie
it
did
you
get
what
you
went
for
to
africa
she
asked
no
i
said
i
lost
my
and
that
lost
everything
she
walked
before
me
into
the
of
the
chalet
and
i
saw
that
she
gripped
her
very
tightly
in
her
hand
she
looked
about
her
for
a
moment
and
then
at
me
it
s
comfortable
she
remarked
our
eyes
met
in
a
conversation
very
different
from
the
one
upon
our
lips
a
sombre
glow
surrounded
us
drew
us
together
an
unwonted
shyness
kept
us
apart
she
roused
herself
after
an
instant
s
pause
to
examine
my
furniture
you
have
chintz
curtains
i
thought
men
were
too
feckless
to
have
curtains
without
a
woman
but
of
course
your
aunt
did
that
and
a
couch
and
a
brass
fender
and
is
that
a
pianola
that
is
your
desk
i
thought
men
s
desks
were
always
untidy
and
covered
with
dust
and
tobacco
she
flitted
to
my
colour
prints
and
my
little
case
of
books
then
she
went
to
the
pianola
i
watched
her
intently
does
this
thing
play
she
said
what
i
asked
does
this
thing
play
i
roused
myself
from
my
preoccupation
like
a
musical
gorilla
with
fingers
all
of
one
length
and
a
sort
of
soul
it
s
all
the
world
of
music
to
what
do
you
play
beethoven
when
i
want
to
clear
up
my
head
while
i
m
working
he
is
how
one
would
always
like
to
work
sometimes
chopin
and
those
others
but
beethoven
beethoven
mainly
silence
again
between
us
she
spoke
with
an
effort
play
me
she
turned
from
me
and
explored
the
rack
of
music
rolls
became
interested
and
took
a
piece
the
first
part
of
the
kreutzer
sonata
hesitated
no
she
said
that
she
gave
me
brahms
second
concerto
op
and
curled
up
on
the
sofa
watching
me
as
i
set
myself
slowly
to
play
i
say
he
said
when
i
had
done
that
s
fine
i
didn
t
know
those
things
could
play
like
that
i
m
all
astir
she
came
and
stood
over
me
looking
at
me
i
m
going
to
have
a
concert
she
said
abruptly
and
laughed
uneasily
and
hovered
at
the
now
now
what
shall
i
have
she
chose
more
of
brahms
then
we
came
to
the
kreutzer
sonata
it
is
queer
how
tolstoy
has
loaded
that
with
suggestions
debauched
it
made
it
a
scandalous
and
intimate
symbol
when
i
had
played
the
first
part
of
that
she
came
up
to
the
pianola
and
hesitated
over
me
i
sat
stiffly
waiting
suddenly
she
seized
my
downcast
head
and
kissed
my
hair
she
caught
at
my
face
between
her
hands
and
kissed
my
lips
i
put
my
arms
about
her
and
we
kissed
together
i
sprang
to
my
feet
and
clasped
her
beatrice
i
said
beatrice
my
dear
she
whispered
nearly
breathless
with
her
arms
about
me
oh
my
dear
ii
love
like
everything
else
in
this
immense
process
of
social
disorganisation
in
which
we
live
is
a
thing
adrift
a
fruitless
thing
broken
away
from
its
connexions
i
tell
of
this
love
affair
here
because
of
its
irrelevance
because
it
is
so
remarkable
that
it
should
mean
nothing
and
be
nothing
except
itself
it
glows
in
my
memory
like
some
bright
casual
flower
starting
up
amidst
the
debris
of
a
catastrophe
for
nearly
a
fortnight
we
two
met
and
made
love
together
once
more
this
mighty
passion
that
our
aimless
civilisation
has
fettered
and
maimed
and
sterilised
and
debased
gripped
me
and
filled
me
with
passionate
delights
and
solemn
joys
that
were
all
you
know
futile
and
purposeless
once
more
i
had
the
persuasion
this
matters
nothing
else
matters
so
much
as
we
were
both
infinitely
grave
in
such
happiness
as
we
had
i
do
not
remember
any
laughter
at
all
between
us
twelve
days
it
lasted
from
that
encounter
in
my
chalet
until
our
parting
except
at
the
end
they
were
days
of
supreme
summer
and
there
was
a
waxing
moon
we
met
recklessly
day
by
day
we
were
so
intent
upon
each
other
at
first
so
intent
upon
expressing
ourselves
to
each
other
and
getting
at
each
other
that
we
troubled
very
little
about
the
appearance
of
our
relationship
we
met
almost
openly
we
talked
of
ten
thousand
things
and
of
ourselves
we
loved
we
made
love
there
is
no
prose
of
mine
that
can
tell
of
hours
transfigured
the
facts
are
nothing
everything
we
touched
the
meanest
things
became
glorious
how
can
i
render
bare
tenderness
and
delight
and
mutual
possession
i
sit
here
at
my
desk
thinking
of
untellable
things
i
have
come
to
know
so
much
of
love
that
i
know
now
what
love
might
be
we
loved
scarred
and
stained
we
parted
basely
and
inevitably
but
at
least
i
met
love
i
remember
as
we
sat
in
a
canadian
canoe
in
a
reedy
shallow
we
had
discovered
operating
out
of
that
woking
canal
how
she
fell
talking
of
the
things
that
happened
to
her
before
she
met
me
again
she
told
me
things
and
they
so
joined
and
welded
together
other
things
that
lay
disconnected
in
my
memory
that
it
seemed
to
me
i
had
always
known
what
she
told
me
and
yet
indeed
i
had
not
known
nor
suspected
it
save
perhaps
for
a
luminous
transitory
suspicion
ever
and
again
she
made
me
see
how
life
had
shaped
her
she
told
me
of
her
girlhood
after
i
had
known
her
we
were
poor
and
pretending
and
managing
we
hacked
about
on
visits
and
things
i
ought
to
have
married
the
chances
i
had
weren
t
particularly
good
chances
i
didn
t
like
she
paused
then
carnaby
came
i
remained
quite
still
she
spoke
now
with
downcast
eyes
and
one
finger
just
touching
the
water
one
gets
bored
bored
beyond
redemption
one
does
about
to
these
huge
expensive
houses
i
suppose
the
scale
s
immense
one
makes
one
s
self
useful
to
the
other
women
and
agreeable
to
the
men
one
has
to
dress
one
has
food
and
exercise
and
leisure
it
s
the
leisure
and
the
space
and
the
blank
opportunity
it
seems
a
sin
not
to
fill
carnaby
isn
t
like
the
other
men
he
s
bigger
they
go
about
making
love
everybody
s
making
love
i
did
and
i
don
t
do
things
by
she
stopped
you
knew
she
asked
looking
up
quite
steadily
i
nodded
since
when
those
last
days
it
hasn
t
seemed
to
matter
really
i
was
a
little
she
looked
at
me
quietly
cothope
knew
she
said
by
instinct
i
could
feel
i
suppose
i
began
once
this
would
have
mattered
immensely
now
nothing
matters
she
said
completing
me
i
felt
i
had
to
tell
you
i
wanted
you
to
understand
why
i
didn
t
marry
you
with
both
hands
i
have
loved
you
she
paused
have
loved
you
ever
since
the
day
i
kissed
you
in
the
bracken
only
i
and
suddenly
she
dropped
her
face
upon
her
hands
and
sobbed
passionately
i
forgot
i
forgot
she
cried
and
became
still
i
dabbled
my
paddle
in
the
water
look
here
i
said
forget
again
here
am
i
a
ruined
man
marry
she
shook
her
head
without
looking
up
we
were
still
for
a
long
time
marry
me
i
whispered
she
looked
up
twined
back
a
whisp
of
hair
and
answered
dispassionately
i
wish
i
could
anyhow
we
have
had
this
time
it
has
been
a
fine
time
has
it
been
for
you
also
i
haven
t
nudged
you
all
i
had
to
give
it
s
a
poor
gift
except
for
what
it
means
and
might
have
been
but
we
are
near
the
end
of
it
why
i
asked
marry
me
why
should
we
two
you
think
she
said
i
could
take
courage
and
come
to
you
and
be
your
everyday
wife
while
you
work
and
are
poor
why
not
said
i
she
looked
at
me
gravely
with
extended
finger
do
you
really
think
that
of
me
haven
t
you
seen
me
all
i
hesitated
never
once
have
i
really
meant
marrying
you
she
insisted
never
once
i
fell
in
love
with
you
from
the
first
but
when
you
seemed
a
successful
man
i
told
myself
i
wouldn
t
i
was
for
you
and
you
were
so
stupid
i
came
near
it
then
but
i
knew
i
wasn
t
good
enough
what
could
i
have
been
to
you
a
woman
with
bad
habits
and
bad
associations
a
woman
smirched
and
what
could
i
do
for
you
or
be
to
you
if
i
wasn
t
good
enough
to
be
a
rich
man
s
wife
i
m
certainly
not
good
enough
to
be
a
poor
one
s
forgive
me
for
talking
sense
to
you
now
but
i
wanted
to
tell
you
this
she
stopped
at
my
gesture
i
sat
up
and
the
canoe
rocked
with
my
movement
i
don
t
care
i
said
i
want
to
marry
you
and
make
you
my
wife
no
she
said
don
t
spoil
things
that
is
impossible
impossible
think
i
can
t
do
my
own
hair
do
you
mean
you
will
get
me
a
maid
good
god
i
cried
disconcerted
beyond
measure
won
t
you
learn
to
do
your
own
hair
for
me
do
you
mean
to
say
you
can
love
a
man
she
flung
out
her
hands
at
me
don
t
spoil
it
she
cried
i
have
given
you
all
i
have
i
have
given
you
all
i
can
if
i
could
do
it
if
i
was
good
enough
to
do
it
i
would
but
i
am
a
woman
spoilt
and
ruined
dear
and
you
are
a
ruined
man
when
we
are
making
love
we
re
lovers
but
think
of
the
gulf
between
us
in
habits
and
ways
of
thought
in
will
and
training
when
we
are
not
making
love
think
of
it
and
don
t
think
of
it
don
t
think
of
it
yet
we
have
snatched
some
hours
we
still
may
have
some
hours
she
suddenly
knelt
forward
toward
me
with
a
glowing
darkness
in
her
eyes
who
cares
if
it
upsets
she
cried
if
you
say
another
word
i
will
kiss
you
and
go
to
the
bottom
clutching
you
i
m
not
afraid
of
that
i
m
not
a
bit
afraid
of
that
i
ll
die
with
you
choose
a
death
and
i
ll
die
with
you
readily
do
listen
to
me
i
love
you
i
shall
always
love
you
it
s
because
i
love
you
that
i
won
t
go
down
to
become
a
dirty
familiar
thing
with
you
amidst
the
grime
i
ve
given
all
i
can
i
ve
had
all
i
can
tell
me
and
she
crept
nearer
have
i
been
like
the
dusk
to
you
like
the
warm
dusk
is
there
magic
still
listen
to
the
ripple
of
water
from
your
paddle
look
at
the
warm
evening
light
in
the
sky
who
cares
if
the
canoe
upsets
come
nearer
to
me
oh
my
love
come
near
she
drew
me
to
her
and
our
lips
met
iii
i
asked
her
to
marry
me
once
again
it
was
our
last
morning
together
and
we
had
met
very
early
about
sunrise
knowing
that
we
were
to
part
no
sun
shone
that
day
the
sky
was
overcast
the
morning
chilly
and
lit
by
a
clear
cold
spiritless
light
a
heavy
dampness
in
the
air
verged
close
on
rain
when
i
think
of
that
morning
it
has
always
the
quality
of
greying
ashes
wet
with
rain
beatrice
too
had
changed
the
spring
had
gone
out
of
her
movement
it
came
to
me
for
the
first
time
that
some
day
she
might
grow
old
she
had
become
one
flesh
with
the
rest
of
common
humanity
the
softness
had
gone
from
her
voice
and
manner
the
dusky
magic
of
her
presence
had
gone
i
saw
these
things
with
perfect
clearness
and
they
made
me
sorry
for
them
and
for
her
but
they
altered
my
love
not
a
whit
abated
it
nothing
and
when
we
had
talked
awkwardly
for
half
a
dozen
sentences
i
came
dully
to
my
point
and
now
i
cried
will
you
marry
me
no
she
said
i
shall
keep
to
my
life
i
asked
her
to
marry
me
in
a
year
s
time
she
shook
her
head
this
world
is
a
soft
world
i
said
in
spite
of
my
present
disasters
i
know
now
how
to
do
things
if
i
had
you
to
work
for
in
a
year
i
could
be
a
prosperous
no
she
said
i
will
put
it
brutally
i
shall
go
back
to
but
i
did
not
feel
angry
i
had
no
sort
of
jealousy
no
wounded
pride
no
sense
of
injury
i
had
only
a
sense
of
grey
desolation
of
hopeless
look
here
she
said
i
have
been
awake
all
night
and
every
night
i
have
been
thinking
of
this
every
moment
when
we
have
not
been
together
i
m
not
answering
you
on
an
impulse
i
love
you
i
love
you
i
ll
say
that
over
ten
thousand
times
but
here
we
are
the
rest
of
life
together
i
said
it
wouldn
t
be
together
now
we
are
together
now
we
have
been
together
we
are
full
of
memories
i
do
not
feel
i
can
ever
forget
a
single
nor
and
i
want
to
close
it
and
leave
it
at
that
you
see
dear
what
else
is
there
to
do
she
turned
her
white
face
to
me
all
i
know
of
love
all
i
have
ever
dreamt
or
learnt
of
love
i
have
packed
into
these
days
for
you
you
think
we
might
live
together
and
go
on
loving
no
for
you
i
will
have
no
vain
repetitions
you
have
had
the
best
and
all
of
me
would
you
have
us
after
this
meet
again
in
london
or
paris
or
somewhere
scuffle
to
some
wretched
dressmaker
s
meet
in
a
cabinet
particulier
no
i
said
i
want
you
to
marry
me
i
want
you
to
play
the
game
of
life
with
me
as
an
honest
woman
should
come
and
live
with
me
be
my
wife
and
squaw
bear
me
i
looked
at
her
white
drawn
face
and
it
seemed
to
me
i
might
carry
her
yet
i
spluttered
for
words
my
god
beatrice
i
cried
but
this
is
cowardice
and
folly
are
you
afraid
of
life
you
of
all
people
what
does
it
matter
what
has
been
or
what
we
were
here
we
are
with
the
world
before
us
start
clean
and
new
with
me
we
ll
fight
it
through
i
m
not
such
a
simple
lover
that
i
ll
not
tell
you
plainly
when
you
go
wrong
and
fight
our
difference
out
with
you
it
s
the
one
thing
i
want
the
one
thing
i
need
to
have
you
and
more
of
you
and
more
this
it
s
it
s
just
a
part
of
us
an
incident
she
shook
her
head
and
stopped
me
abruptly
it
s
all
she
said
all
i
protested
i
m
wiser
than
you
wiser
beyond
she
turned
her
eyes
to
me
and
they
shone
with
tears
i
wouldn
t
have
you
say
anything
but
what
you
re
saying
she
said
but
it
s
nonsense
dear
you
know
it
s
nonsense
as
you
say
i
tried
to
keep
up
the
heroic
note
but
she
would
not
listen
to
it
it
s
no
good
she
cried
almost
petulantly
this
little
world
has
made
us
what
we
are
don
t
you
see
don
t
you
see
what
i
am
i
can
make
love
i
can
make
love
and
be
loved
prettily
dear
don
t
blame
me
i
have
given
you
all
i
have
if
i
had
anything
more
i
have
gone
through
it
all
over
and
over
again
thought
it
out
this
morning
my
head
aches
my
eyes
ache
the
light
has
gone
out
of
me
and
i
am
a
sick
and
tired
woman
but
i
m
talking
wisdom
bitter
wisdom
i
couldn
t
be
any
sort
of
helper
to
you
any
sort
of
wife
any
sort
of
mother
i
m
spoilt
i
m
spoilt
by
this
rich
idle
way
of
living
until
every
habit
is
wrong
every
taste
wrong
the
world
is
wrong
people
can
be
ruined
by
wealth
just
as
much
as
by
poverty
do
you
think
i
wouldn
t
face
life
with
you
if
i
could
if
i
wasn
t
absolutely
certain
i
should
be
down
and
dragging
in
the
first
of
the
journey
here
i
am
damned
damned
but
i
won
t
damn
you
you
know
what
i
am
you
know
you
are
too
clear
and
simple
not
to
know
the
truth
you
try
to
romance
and
hector
but
you
know
the
truth
i
am
a
little
cad
sold
and
done
i
m
my
dear
you
think
i
ve
been
misbehaving
but
all
these
days
i
ve
been
on
my
best
behaviour
you
don
t
understand
because
you
re
a
man
a
woman
when
she
s
spoilt
is
spoilt
she
s
dirty
in
grain
she
s
she
walked
on
weeping
you
re
a
fool
to
want
me
she
said
you
re
a
fool
to
want
me
for
my
sake
just
as
much
as
yours
we
ve
done
all
we
can
it
s
just
romancing
she
dashed
the
tears
from
her
eyes
and
turned
upon
me
don
t
you
understand
she
challenged
don
t
you
know
we
faced
one
another
in
silence
for
a
moment
yes
i
said
i
for
a
long
time
we
spoke
never
a
word
but
walked
on
together
slowly
and
sorrowfully
reluctant
to
turn
about
towards
our
parting
when
at
last
we
did
she
broke
silence
again
i
ve
had
you
she
said
heaven
and
hell
i
said
can
t
alter
i
ve
wanted
she
went
on
i
ve
talked
to
you
in
the
nights
and
made
up
speeches
now
when
i
want
to
make
them
i
m
but
to
me
it
s
just
as
if
the
moments
we
have
had
lasted
for
ever
moods
and
states
come
and
go
my
light
is
out
to
this
day
i
can
not
determine
whether
she
said
or
whether
i
imagined
she
said
perhaps
a
diagnosis
flashed
it
on
my
brain
perhaps
i
am
the
victim
of
some
perverse
imaginative
freak
of
memory
some
hinted
possibility
that
scratched
and
seared
there
the
word
stands
in
my
memory
as
if
it
were
written
in
fire
we
came
to
the
door
of
lady
osprey
s
garden
at
last
and
it
was
beginning
to
drizzle
she
held
out
her
hands
and
i
took
them
yours
she
said
in
a
weary
unimpassioned
voice
all
that
i
had
such
as
it
was
will
you
forget
never
i
answered
never
a
touch
or
a
word
of
it
you
will
she
said
we
looked
at
one
another
in
silence
and
her
face
full
of
fatigue
and
misery
what
could
i
do
what
was
there
to
do
i
wish
i
said
and
stopped
iv
that
should
have
been
the
last
i
saw
of
her
but
indeed
i
was
destined
to
see
her
once
again
two
days
after
i
was
at
lady
grove
i
forget
altogether
upon
what
errand
and
as
i
walked
back
to
the
station
believing
her
to
be
gone
away
she
came
upon
me
and
she
was
riding
with
carnaby
just
as
i
had
seen
them
first
the
encounter
jumped
upon
us
unprepared
she
rode
by
her
eyes
dark
in
her
white
face
and
scarcely
noticed
me
she
winced
and
grew
stiff
at
the
sight
of
me
and
bowed
her
head
but
carnaby
because
he
thought
i
was
a
broken
and
discomfited
man
saluted
me
with
an
easy
friendliness
and
shouted
some
genial
commonplace
to
me
they
passed
out
of
sight
and
left
me
by
the
roadside
and
then
indeed
i
tasted
the
ultimate
bitterness
of
life
for
the
first
time
i
felt
utter
futility
and
was
wrung
by
emotion
that
begot
no
action
by
shame
and
pity
beyond
words
i
had
parted
from
her
dully
and
i
had
seen
my
uncle
break
and
die
with
dry
eyes
and
a
steady
mind
but
this
chance
sight
of
my
lost
beatrice
brought
me
to
tears
my
face
was
wrung
and
tears
came
pouring
down
my
cheeks
all
the
magic
she
had
for
me
had
changed
to
wild
sorrow
oh
god
i
cried
this
is
too
much
and
turned
my
face
after
her
and
made
appealing
gestures
to
the
beech
trees
and
cursed
at
fate
i
wanted
to
do
preposterous
things
to
pursue
her
to
save
her
to
turn
life
back
so
that
she
might
begin
again
i
wonder
what
would
have
happened
had
i
overtaken
them
in
pursuit
breathless
with
running
uttering
incoherent
words
weeping
expostulatory
i
came
near
to
doing
that
there
was
nothing
in
earth
or
heaven
to
respect
my
curses
or
weeping
in
the
midst
of
it
a
man
who
had
been
trimming
the
opposite
hedge
appeared
and
stared
at
me
abruptly
ridiculously
i
dissembled
before
him
and
went
on
and
caught
my
train
but
the
pain
i
felt
then
i
have
felt
a
hundred
times
it
is
with
me
as
i
write
it
haunts
this
book
i
see
that
is
what
haunts
this
book
from
end
to
end
chapter
the
third
night
and
the
open
sea
i
i
have
tried
throughout
all
this
story
to
tell
things
as
they
happened
to
me
in
the
beginning
the
sheets
are
still
here
on
the
table
grimy
and
and
i
said
i
wanted
to
tell
myself
and
the
world
in
which
i
found
myself
and
i
have
done
my
best
but
whether
i
have
succeeded
i
can
not
imagine
all
this
writing
is
grey
now
and
dead
and
trite
and
unmeaning
to
me
some
of
it
i
know
by
heart
i
am
the
last
person
to
judge
it
as
i
turn
over
the
big
pile
of
manuscript
before
me
certain
things
become
clearer
to
me
and
particularly
the
immense
inconsequences
of
my
experiences
it
is
i
see
now
that
i
have
it
all
before
me
a
story
of
activity
and
urgency
and
sterility
i
have
called
it
but
i
had
far
better
have
called
it
waste
i
have
told
of
childless
marion
of
my
childless
aunt
of
beatrice
wasted
and
wasteful
and
futile
what
hope
is
there
for
a
people
whose
women
become
fruitless
i
think
of
all
the
energy
i
have
given
to
vain
things
i
think
of
my
industrious
scheming
with
my
uncle
of
crest
hill
s
vast
cessation
of
his
resonant
strenuous
career
ten
thousand
men
have
envied
him
and
wished
to
live
as
he
lived
it
is
all
one
spectacle
of
forces
running
to
waste
of
people
who
use
and
do
not
replace
the
story
of
a
country
hectic
with
a
wasting
aimless
fever
of
trade
and
and
and
now
i
build
destroyers
other
people
may
see
this
country
in
other
terms
this
is
how
i
have
seen
it
in
some
early
chapter
in
this
heap
i
compared
all
our
present
colour
and
abundance
to
october
foliage
before
the
frosts
nip
down
the
leaves
that
i
still
feel
was
a
good
image
perhaps
i
see
wrongly
it
may
be
i
see
decay
all
about
me
because
i
am
in
a
sense
decay
to
others
it
may
be
a
scene
of
achievement
and
construction
radiant
with
hope
i
too
have
a
sort
of
hope
but
it
is
a
remote
hope
a
hope
that
finds
no
promise
in
this
empire
or
in
any
of
the
great
things
of
our
time
how
they
will
look
in
history
i
do
not
know
how
time
and
chance
will
prove
them
i
can
not
guess
that
is
how
they
have
mirrored
themselves
on
one
contemporary
mind
ii
concurrently
with
writing
the
last
chapter
of
this
book
i
have
been
much
engaged
by
the
affairs
of
a
new
destroyer
we
have
completed
it
has
been
an
oddly
complementary
alternation
of
occupations
three
weeks
or
so
ago
this
novel
had
to
be
put
aside
in
order
that
i
might
give
all
my
time
day
and
night
to
the
fitting
and
finishing
of
the
engines
last
thursday
x
for
so
we
call
her
was
done
and
i
took
her
down
the
thames
and
went
out
nearly
to
texel
for
a
trial
of
speed
it
is
curious
how
at
times
one
s
impressions
will
all
fuse
and
run
together
into
a
sort
of
unity
and
become
continuous
with
things
that
have
hitherto
been
utterly
alien
and
remote
that
rush
down
the
river
became
mysteriously
connected
with
this
book
as
i
passed
down
the
thames
i
seemed
in
a
new
and
parallel
manner
to
be
passing
all
england
in
review
i
saw
it
then
as
i
had
wanted
my
readers
to
see
it
the
thought
came
to
me
slowly
as
i
picked
my
way
through
the
pool
it
stood
out
clear
as
i
went
dreaming
into
the
night
out
upon
the
wide
north
sea
it
wasn
t
so
much
thinking
at
the
time
as
a
sort
of
photographic
thought
that
came
and
grew
clear
went
ripping
through
the
dirty
oily
water
as
scissors
rip
through
canvas
and
the
front
of
my
mind
was
all
intent
with
getting
her
through
under
the
bridges
and
in
and
out
among
the
and
barges
and
and
piers
i
lived
with
my
hands
and
eyes
hard
ahead
i
thought
nothing
then
of
any
appearances
but
obstacles
but
for
all
that
the
back
of
my
mind
took
the
photographic
memory
of
it
complete
and
vivid
this
it
came
to
me
is
england
that
is
what
i
wanted
to
give
in
my
book
this
we
started
in
the
late
afternoon
we
throbbed
out
of
our
yard
above
hammersmith
bridge
fussed
about
for
a
moment
and
headed
down
stream
we
came
at
an
easy
rush
down
craven
reach
past
fulham
and
hurlingham
past
the
long
stretches
of
muddy
meadow
and
muddy
suburb
to
battersea
and
chelsea
round
the
cape
of
tidy
frontage
that
is
grosvenor
road
and
under
vauxhall
bridge
and
westminster
opened
before
us
we
cleared
a
string
of
coal
barges
and
there
on
the
left
in
the
october
sunshine
stood
the
parliament
houses
and
the
flag
was
flying
and
parliament
was
sitting
i
saw
it
at
the
time
unseeingly
afterwards
it
came
into
my
mind
as
the
centre
of
the
whole
broad
panoramic
effect
of
that
afternoon
the
stiff
square
lace
of
victorian
gothic
with
its
dutch
clock
of
a
tower
came
upon
me
suddenly
and
stared
and
whirled
past
in
a
slow
half
pirouette
and
became
still
i
know
behind
me
as
if
watching
me
recede
aren
t
you
going
to
respect
me
then
it
seemed
to
say
not
i
there
in
that
great
pile
of
victorian
architecture
the
landlords
and
the
lawyers
the
bishops
the
railway
men
and
the
magnates
of
commerce
go
to
and
fro
in
their
incurable
tradition
of
commercialised
bladesovery
of
meretricious
gentry
and
nobility
sold
for
riches
i
have
been
near
enough
to
know
the
irish
and
the
run
about
among
their
feet
making
a
fuss
effecting
little
they
ve
got
no
better
plans
that
i
can
see
respect
it
indeed
there
s
a
certain
paraphernalia
of
dignity
but
whom
does
it
deceive
the
king
comes
down
in
a
gilt
coach
to
open
the
show
and
wears
long
robes
and
a
crown
and
there
s
a
display
of
stout
and
slender
legs
in
white
stockings
and
stout
and
slender
legs
in
black
stockings
and
artful
old
gentlemen
in
ermine
i
was
reminded
of
one
congested
afternoon
i
had
spent
with
my
aunt
amidst
a
cluster
of
agitated
women
s
hats
in
the
royal
gallery
of
the
house
of
lords
and
how
i
saw
the
king
going
to
open
parliament
and
the
duke
of
devonshire
looking
like
a
gorgeous
pedlar
and
terribly
bored
with
the
cap
of
maintenance
on
a
tray
before
him
hung
by
slings
from
his
shoulder
a
wonderful
spectacle
it
is
quaint
no
doubt
this
england
it
is
even
dignified
in
places
and
full
of
mellow
associations
that
does
not
alter
the
quality
of
the
realities
these
robes
conceal
the
realities
are
greedy
trade
base
profit
seeking
bold
advertisement
and
kingship
and
chivalry
spite
of
this
wearing
of
treasured
robes
are
as
dead
among
it
all
as
that
crusader
my
uncle
championed
against
the
nettles
outside
the
duffield
church
i
have
thought
much
of
that
bright
afternoon
s
panorama
to
run
down
the
thames
so
is
to
run
one
s
hand
over
the
pages
in
the
book
of
england
from
end
to
end
one
begins
in
craven
reach
and
it
is
as
if
one
were
in
the
heart
of
old
england
behind
us
are
kew
and
hampton
court
with
their
memories
of
kings
and
cardinals
and
one
runs
at
first
between
fulham
s
episcopal
garden
parties
and
hurlingham
s
playground
for
the
sporting
instinct
of
our
race
the
whole
effect
is
english
there
is
space
there
are
old
trees
and
all
the
best
qualities
of
the
in
that
upper
reach
putney
too
looks
anglican
on
a
dwindling
scale
and
then
for
a
stretch
the
newer
developments
slop
over
one
misses
bladesover
and
there
come
first
squalid
stretches
of
mean
homes
right
and
left
and
then
the
dingy
industrialism
of
the
south
side
and
on
the
north
bank
the
polite
long
front
of
nice
houses
artistic
literary
administrative
people
s
residences
that
stretches
from
cheyne
walk
nearly
to
westminster
and
hides
a
wilderness
of
slums
what
a
long
slow
crescendo
that
is
mile
after
mile
with
the
houses
crowding
closelier
the
multiplying
succession
of
church
towers
the
architectural
moments
the
successive
bridges
until
you
come
out
into
the
second
movement
of
the
piece
with
lambeth
s
old
palace
under
your
quarter
and
the
houses
of
parliament
on
your
bow
westminster
bridge
is
ahead
of
you
then
and
through
it
you
flash
and
in
a
moment
the
clock
tower
cranes
up
to
peer
at
you
again
and
new
scotland
yard
squares
at
you
a
fat
of
a
policeman
disguised
miraculously
as
a
bastille
for
a
stretch
you
have
the
essential
london
you
have
charing
cross
railway
station
heart
of
the
world
and
the
embankment
on
the
north
side
with
its
new
hotels
overshadowing
its
georgian
and
victorian
architecture
and
mud
and
great
warehouses
and
factories
chimneys
shot
towers
advertisements
on
the
south
the
northward
skyline
grows
more
intricate
and
pleasing
and
more
and
more
does
one
thank
god
for
wren
somerset
house
is
as
picturesque
as
the
civil
war
one
is
reminded
again
of
the
original
england
one
feels
in
the
fretted
sky
the
quality
of
restoration
lace
and
then
comes
astor
s
strong
box
and
the
lawyers
inns
i
had
a
passing
memory
of
myself
there
how
once
i
had
trudged
along
the
embankment
westward
weighing
my
uncle
s
offer
of
three
hundred
pounds
a
year
through
that
central
essential
london
reach
i
drove
and
bored
her
nose
under
the
foam
regardless
of
it
all
like
a
black
hound
going
through
reeds
on
what
trail
even
i
who
made
her
can
not
tell
and
in
this
reach
too
one
first
meets
the
seagulls
and
is
reminded
of
the
sea
blackfriars
one
takes
just
under
these
two
bridges
and
just
between
them
is
the
finest
bridge
moment
in
the
world
and
behold
soaring
up
hanging
in
the
sky
over
a
rude
tumult
of
warehouses
over
a
jostling
competition
of
traders
irrelevantly
beautiful
and
altogether
remote
saint
paul
s
of
course
one
says
saint
paul
s
it
is
the
very
figure
of
whatever
fineness
the
old
anglican
culture
achieved
detached
a
more
dignified
and
chastened
saint
peter
s
colder
greyer
but
still
ornate
it
has
never
been
over
thrown
never
disavowed
only
the
tall
warehouses
and
all
the
roar
of
traffic
have
forgotten
it
every
one
has
forgotten
it
the
steamships
the
barges
go
heedlessly
by
regardless
of
it
intricacies
of
telephone
wires
and
poles
cut
blackly
into
its
thin
mysteries
and
presently
when
in
a
moment
the
traffic
permits
you
and
you
look
round
for
it
it
has
dissolved
like
a
cloud
into
the
grey
blues
of
the
london
sky
and
then
the
traditional
and
ostensible
england
falls
from
you
altogether
the
third
movement
begins
the
last
great
movement
in
the
london
symphony
in
which
the
trim
scheme
of
the
old
order
is
altogether
dwarfed
and
swallowed
up
comes
london
bridge
and
the
great
warehouses
tower
up
about
you
waving
stupendous
cranes
the
gulls
circle
and
scream
in
your
ears
large
ships
lie
among
their
lighters
and
one
is
in
the
port
of
the
world
again
and
again
in
this
book
i
have
written
of
england
as
a
feudal
scheme
overtaken
by
fatty
degeneration
and
stupendous
accidents
of
hypertrophy
for
the
last
time
i
must
strike
that
note
as
the
memory
of
the
dear
neat
little
sunlit
ancient
tower
of
london
lying
away
in
a
gap
among
the
warehouses
comes
back
to
me
that
little
accumulation
of
buildings
so
provincially
pleasant
and
dignified
overshadowed
by
the
vulgarest
most
typical
exploit
of
modern
england
the
sham
gothic
casings
to
the
ironwork
of
the
tower
bridge
that
tower
bridge
is
the
very
balance
and
confirmation
of
westminster
s
dull
pinnacles
and
tower
that
sham
gothic
bridge
in
the
very
gates
of
our
mother
of
change
the
sea
but
after
that
one
is
in
a
world
of
accident
and
nature
for
the
third
part
of
the
panorama
of
london
is
beyond
all
law
order
and
precedence
it
is
the
seaport
and
the
sea
one
goes
down
the
widening
reaches
through
a
monstrous
variety
of
shipping
great
steamers
great
trailing
the
flags
of
all
the
world
a
monstrous
confusion
of
lighters
witches
conferences
of
barges
wallowing
tugs
a
tumultuous
crowding
and
jostling
of
cranes
and
spars
and
wharves
and
stores
and
assertive
inscriptions
huge
vistas
of
dock
open
right
and
left
of
one
and
here
and
there
beyond
and
amidst
it
all
are
church
towers
little
patches
of
indescribably
and
houses
riverside
pubs
and
the
like
vestiges
of
townships
that
were
long
since
torn
to
fragments
and
submerged
in
these
new
growths
and
amidst
it
all
no
plan
appears
no
intention
no
comprehensive
desire
that
is
the
very
key
of
it
all
each
day
one
feels
that
the
pressure
of
commerce
and
traffic
grew
grew
insensibly
monstrous
and
first
this
man
made
a
wharf
and
that
erected
a
crane
and
then
this
company
set
to
work
and
then
that
and
so
they
jostled
together
to
make
this
unassimilable
enormity
of
traffic
through
it
we
dodged
and
drove
eager
for
the
high
seas
i
remember
how
i
laughed
aloud
at
the
glimpse
of
the
name
of
a
london
county
council
steamboat
that
ran
across
me
caxton
it
was
called
and
another
was
pepys
and
another
was
shakespeare
they
seemed
so
wildly
out
of
place
splashing
about
in
that
confusion
one
wanted
to
take
them
out
and
wipe
them
and
put
them
back
in
some
english
gentleman
s
library
everything
was
alive
about
them
flash
ing
splashing
and
passing
ships
moving
tugs
panting
hawsers
taut
barges
going
down
with
men
toiling
at
the
sweeps
the
water
all
with
the
wash
of
shipping
scaling
into
millions
of
little
wavelets
curling
and
frothing
under
the
whip
of
the
unceasing
wind
past
it
all
we
drove
and
at
greenwich
to
the
south
you
know
there
stands
a
fine
stone
frontage
where
all
the
victories
are
recorded
in
a
painted
hall
and
beside
it
is
the
ship
where
once
upon
a
time
those
gentlemen
of
westminster
used
to
have
an
annual
dinner
before
the
port
of
london
got
too
much
for
them
altogether
the
old
facade
of
the
hospital
was
just
warming
to
the
sunset
as
we
went
by
and
after
that
right
and
left
the
river
opened
the
sense
of
the
sea
increased
and
prevailed
reach
after
reach
from
northfleet
to
the
nore
and
out
you
come
at
last
with
the
sun
behind
you
into
the
eastern
sea
you
speed
up
and
tear
the
oily
water
louder
and
faster
siroo
and
the
hills
of
kent
over
which
i
once
fled
from
the
christian
teachings
of
nicodemus
frapp
fall
away
on
the
right
hand
and
essex
on
the
left
they
fall
away
and
vanish
into
blue
haze
and
the
tall
slow
ships
behind
the
tugs
scarce
moving
ships
and
wallowing
sturdy
tugs
are
all
wrought
of
wet
gold
as
one
goes
frothing
by
they
stand
out
bound
on
strange
missions
of
life
and
death
to
the
killing
of
men
in
unfamiliar
lands
and
now
behind
us
is
blue
mystery
and
the
phantom
flash
of
unseen
lights
and
presently
even
these
are
gone
and
i
and
my
destroyer
tear
out
to
the
unknown
across
a
great
grey
space
we
tear
into
the
great
spaces
of
the
future
and
the
turbines
fall
to
talking
in
unfamiliar
tongues
out
to
the
open
we
go
to
windy
freedom
and
trackless
ways
light
after
light
goes
down
england
and
the
kingdom
britain
and
the
empire
the
old
prides
and
the
old
devotions
glide
abeam
astern
sink
down
upon
the
horizon
pass
pass
the
river
passes
london
passes
england
passes
iii
this
is
the
note
i
have
tried
to
emphasise
the
note
that
sounds
clear
in
my
mind
when
i
think
of
anything
beyond
the
purely
personal
aspects
of
my
story
it
is
a
note
of
crumbling
and
confusion
of
change
and
seemingly
aimless
swelling
of
a
bubbling
up
and
medley
of
futile
loves
and
sorrows
but
through
the
confusion
sounds
another
note
through
the
confusion
something
drives
something
that
is
at
once
human
achievement
and
the
most
inhuman
of
all
existing
things
something
comes
out
of
it
how
can
i
express
the
values
of
a
thing
at
once
so
essential
and
so
immaterial
it
is
something
that
calls
upon
such
men
as
i
with
an
irresistible
appeal
i
have
figured
it
in
my
last
section
by
the
symbol
of
my
destroyer
stark
and
swift
irrelevant
to
most
human
interests
sometimes
i
call
this
reality
science
sometimes
i
call
it
truth
but
it
is
something
we
draw
by
pain
and
effort
ont
of
the
heart
of
life
that
we
disentangle
and
make
clear
other
men
serve
it
i
know
in
art
in
literature
in
social
invention
and
see
it
in
a
thousand
different
figures
under
a
hundred
names
i
see
it
always
as
austerity
as
beauty
this
thing
we
make
clear
is
the
heart
of
life
it
is
the
one
enduring
thing
men
and
nations
epochs
and
civilisation
pass
each
making
its
contribution
i
do
not
know
what
it
is
this
something
except
that
it
is
supreme
it
is
a
something
a
quality
an
element
one
may
find
now
in
colours
now
in
norms
now
in
sounds
now
in
thoughts
it
emerges
from
life
with
each
year
one
lives
and
feels
and
generation
by
generation
and
age
by
age
but
the
how
and
why
of
it
are
all
beyond
the
compass
of
my
mind
yet
the
full
sense
of
it
was
with
me
all
that
night
as
i
drove
lonely
above
the
rush
and
murmur
of
my
engines
out
upon
the
weltering
circle
of
the
sea
far
out
to
the
northeast
there
came
the
flicker
of
a
squadron
of
warships
waving
white
swords
of
light
about
the
sky
i
kept
them
and
presently
they
were
mere
summer
lightning
over
the
watery
edge
of
the
globe
i
fell
into
thought
that
was
nearly
formless
into
doubts
and
dreams
that
have
no
words
and
it
seemed
good
to
me
to
drive
ahead
and
on
and
or
through
the
windy
starlight
over
the
long
black
waves
iv
it
was
morning
and
day
before
i
returned
with
the
four
sick
and
starving
journalists
who
had
got
permission
to
come
with
me
up
the
shining
river
and
past
the
old
grey
tower
i
recall
the
back
views
of
those
journalists
very
distinctly
going
with
a
certain
damp
weariness
of
movement
along
a
side
street
away
from
the
river
they
were
good
men
and
bore
me
no
malice
and
they
served
me
up
to
the
public
in
turgid
degenerate
kiplingese
as
a
modest
button
on
the
complacent
stomach
of
the
empire
though
as
a
matter
of
fact
isn
t
intended
for
the
empire
or
indeed
for
the
hands
of
any
european
power
we
offered
it
to
our
own
people
first
but
they
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
me
and
i
have
long
since
ceased
to
trouble
much
about
such
questions
i
have
come
to
see
myself
from
the
outside
my
country
from
the
outside
without
illusions
we
make
and
pass
we
are
all
things
that
make
and
pass
striving
upon
a
hidden
mission
out
to
the
open
sea
