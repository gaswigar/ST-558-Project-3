new

new

a
blissful
spring
morning
beckoned
cloudless
and
blue
and
pure
i
was
driving
my
toyota
down
seventh
avenue
headed
for
the
location
shoot
that
was
supposed
to
wind
up
principal
photography
for
my
first
feature
film
it
was
about
the
pain
and
joy
of
adoption
i
guess
directing
your
first
feature
is
something
like
giving
birth
to
your
first
child
but
that
gets
us
way
way
ahead
of
the
story
my
name
by
the
way
is
morgan
smyth
james
after
two
grandmothers
and
i
and
single
and
strive
to
be
eternally
optimistic
that
morning
however
in
spite
of
everything
else
i
was
missing
steve
terribly
and
feeling
like
i
screwed
up
essential
components
of
my
life
to
try
for
some
perspective
let
me
say
i
always
planned
to
have
a
normal
loving
family
really
find
an
emotionally
present
soul
mate
who
cared
about
things
i
care
about
okay
slim
and
smart
and
spectacular
in
bed
would
be
a
minus
get
married
on
a
lawn
with
lots
of
white
roses
some
sunny
june
afternoon
work
one
or
even
two
perfect
kids
into
our
fulfilling
giving
lives
but
somehow
i
managed
to
have
none
of
that
i
messed
up
at
every
turn
in
reality
i
had
nobody
to
blame
but
myself
eighteen
years
ago
just
out
of
college
i
turned
down
two
really
nice
guys
my
body
was
fertile
and
was
it
ever
but
grad
school
loomed
and
my
greatest
fear
instead
of
as
now
my
fondest
hope
was
getting
trapped
into
motherhood
also
i
had
the
youthful
delusion
that
life
was
forever
there
was
in
truth
one
simpatico
young
director
i
met
at
nyu
film
school
whom
i
would
have
married
in
a
minute
but
after
jason
won
my
heart
he
dumped
me
for
his
undergraduate
sweetheart
who
had
skillfully
gotten
herself
knocked
up
during
his
christmas
break
which
was
when
i
first
developed
my
fallback
strategy
for
coping
with
bad
news
after
moping
around
in
sweats
for
two
days
cutting
class
and
hiding
in
a
revival
house
showing
a
goddard
retrospective
not
understanding
half
the
french
and
too
to
read
the
subtitles
i
decided
to
build
a
defense
system
from
that
day
on
put
all
heartbreak
in
a
special
box
nail
down
the
lid
and
act
as
though
it
was
there
it
worked
then
and
it
still
works
more
or
less
now
people
sometimes
accuse
me
of
living
in
selective
denial
they
right
but
it
makes
me
one
heck
of
a
survivor
and
something
else
i
decided
then
and
there
to
focus
my
life
concentrate
on
learning
to
make
movies
and
let
the
family
part
just
play
out
naturally
i
had
the
idea
that
whereas
men
affections
could
be
controlled
a
career
could
even
then
i
realized
it
was
only
a
partial
truth
but
i
decided
to
go
with
it
anyway
which
brings
us
down
to
three
years
back
and
a
funny
thing
was
happening
almost
without
realizing
it
i
started
lingering
in
stores
to
look
at
little
pink
jumpers
begun
gazing
into
the
baby
carriages
that
suddenly
seemed
to
be
sprouting
everywhere
the
phrase
my
baby
became
the
most
powerful
one
i
could
imagine
made
my
throat
swell
till
i
half
choke
at
which
precise
time
like
a
ex
enter
steve
abrams
the
man
who
gave
me
hope
he
came
along
just
as
i
was
noticing
that
infinite
stream
of
wonderful
guys
had
dwindled
down
to
relationship
dropouts
men
with
distant
eyes
and
former
wives
in
other
states
we
discovered
each
other
at
the
reopened
oloffson
hotel
in
haiti
where
i
was
shooting
a
documentary
about
voodoo
and
he
was
photographing
that
country
ragged
plucky
children
for
national
geographic
no
no
need
for
psychic
pampering
okay
he
was
going
to
win
a
universe
contest
any
time
soon
he
had
a
couple
of
extra
pounds
that
actually
i
kind
of
liked
but
he
was
my
age
had
great
brown
eyes
sandy
hair
thinning
only
just
a
bit
no
greek
god
but
definitely
a
man
he
could
tune
a
jeep
carburetor
with
his
eyes
closed
or
fix
a
cranky
hotel
lock
then
recite
byron
sort
of
and
proceed
to
snare
the
perfect
chilean
red
for
crawfish
yes
but
i
knew
i
loved
him
when
i
realized
it
was
more
than
any
of
that
i
felt
as
if
found
the
other
half
of
myself
just
one
glance
across
the
table
and
we
each
knew
what
the
other
was
thinking
feeling
we
laugh
at
the
same
instant
then
as
though
on
cue
half
cry
together
over
the
miseries
of
that
wretched
island
sometimes
it
was
almost
eerie
and
as
for
lovemaking
let
me
just
say
steve
did
need
a
manual
we
were
made
for
each
other
maybe
it
to
mention
it
but
i
also
felt
safe
around
him
and
i
think
he
felt
the
same
we
liked
that
feeling
us
fending
off
the
world
when
we
got
back
to
new
york
we
had
to
see
each
other
every
day
we
still
had
separate
apartments
thanks
to
the
new
york
squeeze
but
we
were
scouting
in
our
spare
time
for
an
affordable
loft
in
lower
manhattan
that
could
accommodate
steve
darkroom
my
office
and
yes
a
baby
we
evolved
into
pricing
baby
carriages
who
could
have
predicted
it
the
joy
of
sharing
a
need
it
was
a
total
high
before
long
we
decided
to
stop
waiting
for
the
perfect
space
we
start
on
the
baby
anyway
our
first
joint
project
which
we
believed
would
only
be
the
first
of
many
but
nothing
happened
over
a
year
and
still
nothing
that
was
when
life
began
to
feel
like
a
cruel
when
you
are
ready
you
can
produce
a
baby
in
a
momentary
whereas
once
you
finally
an
adult
accomplished
woman
ready
to
be
the
mother
you
wish
you
had
your
body
has
closed
down
your
equipment
like
an
unused
rust
belt
factory
fertility
has
calculatingly
abandoned
you
for
the
sun
belt
of
youth
well
hannah
klein
my
declared
our
tests
all
indicate
you
both
fertile
so
just
keep
trying
under
optimum
conditions
optimum
conditions
there
followed
almost
a
year
of
optimum
conditions
do
it
upside
down
wait
and
have
a
cold
shower
while
i
take
my
temperature
no
not
that
way
not
tonight
my
mucus
is
thicker
quick
eventually
we
both
began
feeling
like
laboratory
rats
our
love
life
drifted
into
something
only
a
sergeant
with
nazi
leanings
could
be
turned
on
by
i
think
that
what
finally
caused
steve
to
go
over
the
edge
three
months
ago
a
friday
morning
i
shall
never
forget
he
stepped
out
of
my
shower
swathed
himself
in
a
white
towel
and
announced
he
was
going
to
central
america
to
do
a
book
he
needed
time
to
think
the
move
he
explained
was
about
us
he
really
wanted
to
spend
a
year
down
there
with
his
nikon
capturing
the
region
tentative
processes
of
democratic
transition
besides
he
was
beginning
to
think
we
both
gone
a
little
mental
about
the
baby
out
came
that
special
box
of
heartbreak
again
i
consoled
myself
we
were
just
having
a
stretch
but
the
wisdom
in
that
box
told
me
i
somehow
blown
it
the
baby
we
had
created
had
become
a
specter
hovering
in
the
ether
between
us
ever
a
reminder
of
failure
as
a
parting
gesture
the
long
shot
he
left
a
deposit
with
klein
for
her
enough
for
two
final
intrauterine
inseminations
later
on
today
i
was
going
to
see
her
and
find
out
if
our
last
and
final
attempt
had
stuck
but
nothing
about
my
cycle
was
giving
me
any
hope
in
the
meantime
though
i
had
a
movie
to
finish
we
were
shooting
an
interview
at
a
condominium
building
in
greenwich
village
belonging
to
a
woman
named
carly
grove
who
recently
adopted
her
story
was
intriguing
but
now
with
my
own
hopes
of
ever
having
a
baby
down
to
two
outs
in
the
bottom
of
the
ninth
well
now
i
had
more
than
one
reason
for
wanting
to
meet
her
when
i
arrived
i
lucked
into
a
parking
space
right
in
front
our
security
guy
lou
crenshaw
was
off
today
getting
some
city
paperwork
sorted
out
but
my
crew
was
already
upstairs
as
director
i
get
to
arrive
at
a
decent
hour
though
later
on
i
also
get
to
do
lonely
postproduction
work
till
midnight
leaving
our
three
vans
with
a
new
york
city
film
board
permit
prominently
displayed
inside
each
windshield
the
building
formerly
a
hertz
parking
garage
was
near
the
end
of
barrow
street
facing
the
hudson
river
and
was
filled
with
artists
and
entrepreneurs
the
truth
was
i
wanted
to
get
the
interview
on
film
as
soon
as
possible
i
was
more
than
a
little
worried
carly
might
decide
to
get
cold
feet
and
back
out
she
started
to
hedge
when
i
had
one
last
confirming
chat
with
her
last
night
something
about
a
agreement
she
now
remembered
signing
this
had
to
be
a
shoot
which
was
why
i
sent
down
the
full
gang
this
morning
not
just
the
key
personnel
as
i
initially
planned
leading
my
motley
crew
was
the
director
of
photography
first
cameraman
roger
drexel
a
grizzled
veteran
with
a
ponytail
who
been
with
my
producer
david
roth
and
his
applecore
productions
from
back
when
he
did
beach
movies
and
splatter
films
he
worked
with
the
production
manager
erica
cole
our
lipstick
lesbian
who
coordinated
crew
schedules
the
second
camera
was
handled
by
greer
seiber
recently
of
nyu
film
school
who
was
so
happy
to
have
a
job
any
job
she
acted
as
though
david
previous
string
of
epics
were
remakes
of
with
the
scott
ventri
another
applecore
was
key
grip
the
guy
who
got
the
gear
on
and
off
the
vans
set
it
up
and
signed
off
on
safety
regs
today
he
also
was
responsible
for
blacking
out
windows
and
setting
up
lights
the
chief
electrician
gaffer
was
ralph
cafiero
who
come
down
the
previous
day
and
temporarily
the
circuit
breaker
in
the
apartment
to
make
sure
there
was
enough
amperage
he
and
his
lighting
crew
another
and
cheap
nyu
grad
named
paul
nulty
had
arrived
this
morning
ahead
of
everybody
else
to
the
set
a
northeast
corner
of
the
apartment
i
always
a
little
hyper
about
sound
so
i
asked
tony
wills
who
handled
recording
to
also
come
down
the
previous
day
and
record
the
tone
of
the
living
room
the
sound
when
there
is
no
sound
in
order
to
have
it
available
for
editing
today
he
run
the
boom
mike
and
be
assisted
by
sherry
moran
his
latest
girlfriend
who
was
for
carly
makeup
and
hair
i
had
arlene
morris
an
old
friend
from
all
the
way
back
to
my
early
days
as
an
ad
on
the
soaps
i
rang
carly
bell
and
she
buzzed
me
right
up
she
doubtless
had
a
closet
full
of
donna
karan
suits
but
she
came
to
the
door
in
jeans
and
a
striped
sweater
a
successful
publicity
agent
she
was
petite
with
dark
hair
and
eyes
and
an
obvious
take
on
life
come
on
in
my
nanny
here
to
help
keep
kevin
out
of
the
way
she
was
sounding
like
she
gotten
her
old
spunk
back
or
so
it
seemed
at
first
i
completely
cleared
the
living
room
i
looked
around
the
place
now
a
vision
of
setup
pandemonium
sure
this
is
all
right
well
she
was
biting
at
her
lip
maybe
we
ought
to
talk
first
okay
but
come
on
in
i
probably
do
it
maybe
i
just
need
a
good
reason
to
as
her
voice
trailed
off
i
found
myself
mining
my
brain
for
a
sales
point
finally
out
of
the
blue
i
settled
on
one
because
totally
crazy
she
laughed
out
loud
not
a
bad
start
i
live
in
total
madness
the
definition
of
my
life
i
laughed
too
and
looked
around
no
kidding
her
loft
apartment
was
a
wild
mixture
of
stairs
and
galleries
and
levels
unconventional
in
every
way
also
it
had
a
lot
of
decor
outrageous
posters
and
african
fertility
masks
signs
of
a
wonderful
irreverent
personality
then
too
stuffed
animals
and
toys
were
strewn
all
over
i
ca
really
afford
the
rent
she
declared
seeing
me
survey
the
place
but
i
need
the
space
for
kevin
i
just
joined
anonymous
twelve
steps
to
shredding
your
charge
plates
her
nanny
a
jehovah
witness
from
jamaica
named
marcy
who
reminded
me
of
a
cuddly
voodoo
doll
complete
with
cornrows
was
bringing
carly
little
boy
kevin
down
from
his
bath
in
the
upstairs
bathroom
he
was
definitely
adopted
and
peachy
nothing
like
carly
dark
severe
strands
and
mediterranean
skin
when
marcy
put
him
down
he
tried
to
walk
and
i
felt
my
envy
ratchet
upward
a
notch
just
started
taking
tentative
steps
at
eleven
months
old
and
there
was
still
a
frankenstein
quality
as
he
strode
arms
out
for
balance
i
walked
over
picked
him
up
and
gave
him
a
kiss
he
looked
like
a
scandinavian
travel
poster
a
cherubic
vision
and
i
felt
a
great
void
growing
where
my
heart
had
been
then
marcy
reached
out
and
pried
him
from
me
i
hated
to
let
him
go
so
much
i
almost
pulled
him
back
you
so
lucky
i
said
to
carly
feeling
a
surge
of
yearning
great
you
know
she
said
i
been
thinking
about
that
thing
children
of
light
made
me
sign
that
their
name
by
the
way
like
a
vow
of
silence
about
them
they
seemed
pretty
serious
about
it
dear
god
i
thought
do
let
her
chicken
out
do
do
so
we
wo
mention
them
just
never
use
their
name
she
stood
a
minute
mute
and
then
her
eyes
grew
determined
no
got
a
better
idea
i
like
you
and
i
think
more
single
women
ought
to
know
about
adoption
so
you
know
what
i
think
i
use
their
name
all
over
the
damned
place
i
paid
what
they
asked
and
for
that
i
ought
to
be
able
to
do
what
i
want
what
are
they
going
to
do
come
and
steal
kevin
back
then
she
sighed
and
stared
at
me
maybe
though
you
could
run
through
again
how
exactly
we
fit
into
this
movie
i
liked
to
tell
the
story
to
people
just
to
get
their
reaction
there
are
always
moments
of
doubt
in
the
process
when
you
wonder
if
the
audience
for
your
picture
is
going
to
consist
entirely
of
your
immediate
family
your
backers
and
your
creditors
well
as
i
tried
to
explain
before
it
a
fictional
construct
intended
to
feel
like
a
documentary
about
a
career
slave
named
gail
crea
who
based
on
a
hundred
women
i
know
she
got
a
great
career
manages
for
a
major
museum
and
work
is
going
great
but
then
one
day
she
finds
herself
suddenly
daydreaming
about
babies
envying
mothers
she
yearns
for
someone
to
take
care
of
has
a
recurrent
dream
she
stealing
a
baby
out
of
a
carriage
on
the
street
it
demeaning
god
carly
said
i
know
exactly
what
you
talking
about
i
been
there
have
i
ever
the
truth
was
i
also
knew
it
all
too
well
it
was
poignant
and
demeaning
at
the
same
time
anyway
gail
focused
on
career
all
through
her
twenties
and
by
her
late
thirties
she
become
a
serious
professional
but
her
personal
life
is
still
on
hold
she
people
at
work
or
some
other
way
and
she
has
a
couple
of
relationships
that
finally
crater
because
the
guys
make
that
space
along
the
way
there
ghastly
and
dismal
dinners
with
what
seem
like
a
hundred
thousand
misfits
she
becomes
the
dating
queen
of
new
york
but
eventually
she
realizes
all
the
men
she
meeting
are
either
assuaging
their
midlife
crises
with
some
pneumatic
bombshell
named
bambi
or
they
divorced
and
whining
and
carrying
a
ton
of
emotional
baggage
the
fact
is
she
become
the
sensible
successful
professional
been
looking
for
all
this
time
this
all
sort
of
seeps
in
as
back
story
i
perched
on
a
stool
at
the
breakfast
bar
and
looked
down
at
my
jeans
and
noticed
that
a
rip
was
starting
in
the
crotch
shit
back
to
cottage
cheese
those
horrible
eight
pounds
i
could
never
get
rid
of
i
crossed
my
legs
finally
after
she
gets
a
couple
more
promotions
she
wakes
up
one
morning
and
realizes
she
never
going
to
have
a
family
all
the
stable
rational
men
have
disappeared
like
there
a
black
hole
or
something
nothing
left
but
the
walking
wounded
she
concludes
it
actually
easier
to
get
a
baby
than
a
decent
guy
which
is
what
she
starts
trying
to
do
high
concept
this
picture
is
about
how
adopting
a
baby
can
enrich
the
life
of
a
childless
human
being
and
not
coincidentally
bring
joy
to
an
orphaned
infant
i
remembered
when
i
first
pitched
it
to
david
roth
of
applecore
his
response
had
been
definitely
probably
never
get
past
the
angelika
a
wide
release
is
gon
na
be
three
screens
where
they
serve
iced
cappuccino
i
was
dead
set
to
prove
him
wrong
so
i
wound
up
i
shot
the
entire
film
but
now
thinking
it
over
i
decided
there
one
last
thing
i
need
to
do
as
i
go
through
the
story
at
every
step
of
the
adoption
process
i
want
to
cut
to
an
interview
just
talking
heads
tight
shot
of
somebody
who
actually
went
through
it
nonfiction
the
happy
ending
and
where
you
come
in
what
i
was
telling
her
was
i
was
increasingly
concerned
the
picture
might
be
slightly
hollow
without
this
punch
of
real
life
well
carly
declared
with
a
grin
my
ending
could
be
happier
okay
want
to
get
started
i
looked
around
at
arlene
makeup
who
always
seemed
to
have
more
on
her
face
than
in
her
bag
i
kidded
her
about
that
a
lot
but
she
was
actually
the
one
who
had
found
carly
bumping
into
her
at
a
gym
in
the
village
hey
let
go
for
it
arlene
grinned
i
turned
back
to
carly
so
how
about
we
prep
a
little
while
getting
the
look
in
the
back
of
my
mind
i
knew
what
i
wanted
for
the
interview
something
like
the
feeling
i
remembered
from
thin
blue
where
people
engaged
in
monologues
that
told
us
more
about
them
than
they
themselves
knew
that
let
us
really
know
their
secrets
and
their
fears
the
interviewer
was
never
seen
or
heard
arlene
ensconced
carly
at
the
dining
room
table
a
weathered
country
french
where
she
already
unfolded
and
plugged
in
a
mirror
with
lights
having
kevin
has
been
wonderful
carly
began
he
changed
my
life
sure
being
a
single
makes
for
a
lot
of
days
but
no
matter
how
much
i
complain
it
worth
every
burp
i
thought
momentarily
about
having
her
hold
him
during
the
interview
but
instantly
decided
it
would
be
too
distracting
kevin
and
his
wonderful
eyes
would
commandeer
the
camera
a
kid
this
cute
in
a
scene
was
nothing
less
than
grand
larceny
he
came
toddling
in
now
dragging
a
stuffed
brown
bear
then
he
banged
its
head
and
tried
to
say
its
name
benny
his
funny
awkward
walk
reminded
me
a
little
of
lou
crenshaw
after
a
couple
of
drinks
god
he
was
fantastic
come
here
sweetie
i
picked
him
up
inhaling
his
fresh
baby
scent
and
wanted
to
hold
him
forever
while
he
slammed
the
bear
against
my
face
this
child
i
thought
is
too
good
to
be
true
he
was
wearing
a
small
bracelet
around
his
left
ankle
a
tiny
little
chain
with
a
small
silver
medallion
attached
it
looked
like
the
face
of
a
cat
funny
carly
did
have
a
cat
was
a
cat
person
so
why
the
little
bracelet
and
the
back
had
a
bunch
of
lines
and
dots
like
a
morse
code
ask
her
about
that
i
thought
but
later
now
carly
was
caught
up
in
the
sound
of
her
own
voice
and
on
a
roll
while
arlene
continued
with
the
makeup
moving
to
her
eyes
she
bubbled
on
like
i
told
you
on
the
phone
i
tried
and
tried
to
adopt
through
a
whole
bunch
of
lawyers
but
it
was
a
nightmare
one
guy
even
helped
me
put
ads
in
newspapers
all
around
the
country
but
nothing
worked
i
kept
getting
scammed
by
women
who
wanted
thousands
of
dollars
up
front
then
backed
out
at
the
last
minute
she
was
getting
up
looking
intense
let
me
have
a
minute
i
want
to
make
coffee
for
everybody
i
followed
her
into
the
kitchen
which
was
the
country
type
with
a
faux
granite
counter
and
lots
of
pans
hanging
from
the
ceiling
she
was
right
about
the
pain
of
adoption
which
was
why
her
story
was
such
a
burst
of
sunshine
as
part
of
the
research
for
my
picture
i
actually
gone
to
meet
an
adoption
attorney
out
in
brooklyn
a
guy
named
frank
brasco
i
been
pretending
to
be
a
client
to
find
out
firsthand
how
tough
it
really
was
what
i
heard
was
chilling
i
do
want
to
get
your
hopes
up
he
declared
for
cheery
openers
finding
a
healthy
caucasian
american
baby
is
virtually
out
of
the
question
so
naturally
we
focus
on
all
the
same
it
can
take
years
and
there
incredible
paperwork
passports
for
the
kid
an
extended
visa
for
you
while
you
go
there
and
then
wait
around
to
process
everything
in
triplicate
bribes
corruption
you
imagine
he
sighed
and
adjusted
his
toupee
as
though
the
very
thought
made
him
weary
and
that
just
the
foreign
end
here
you
have
the
ins
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
they
give
a
bad
name
he
examined
me
closely
not
jewish
i
take
it
if
that
what
you
looking
for
you
may
have
to
wait
for
the
messiah
now
almost
a
year
and
a
lot
of
experience
later
i
knew
full
well
how
right
he
was
which
was
what
made
carly
story
so
fantastic
so
how
did
you
manage
to
get
kevin
you
said
it
only
took
a
few
months
well
to
go
back
to
the
beginning
i
did
start
out
wanting
to
adopt
but
when
the
guy
i
was
planning
to
marry
got
cold
feet
after
four
and
a
half
years
the
louse
and
there
was
nobody
else
on
the
horizon
i
decided
to
just
have
a
baby
on
my
own
you
know
find
some
smart
hunk
seduce
him
and
get
things
going
the
way
or
if
that
did
work
then
i
figured
i
just
go
to
a
sperm
bank
who
needs
an
actual
man
right
she
took
out
a
white
and
green
bag
of
coffee
beans
labeled
on
the
side
i
was
still
holding
kevin
who
threw
benny
onto
the
floor
then
began
to
sniffle
and
point
but
carly
seemed
not
to
notice
as
she
shook
the
coffee
beans
into
the
grinder
well
getting
a
baby
the
fun
way
turned
out
to
be
moot
because
it
seems
i
have
some
kind
of
uterine
condition
which
meant
i
could
get
pregnant
or
even
do
an
in
vitro
bottom
line
if
i
wanted
a
baby
i
had
to
adopt
she
pressed
the
button
on
the
coffee
grinder
sending
a
blast
of
whirring
through
the
kitchen
in
seconds
it
was
over
and
she
was
tapping
the
batch
into
her
braun
so
that
when
i
started
on
the
attorney
thing
got
worked
over
good
trying
to
adopt
as
a
single
mom
and
finally
heard
about
children
of
light
the
adoption
organization
what
do
you
know
about
them
tell
you
the
main
thing
she
said
they
the
place
that
can
make
it
happen
she
reached
over
and
poked
kevin
tummy
right
big
guy
sure
looked
that
way
what
a
cutie
by
now
the
spacious
living
room
had
been
turned
into
a
mini
film
set
with
two
panaflex
cameras
set
up
windows
blanked
out
lights
and
filters
in
place
and
a
video
camera
and
monitor
having
tested
the
boom
mike
and
the
tape
recorder
tony
and
sherry
were
ready
carly
announced
to
everybody
that
coffee
was
available
and
i
handed
kevin
over
to
marcy
then
together
we
marched
into
the
living
room
okay
i
told
her
we
going
to
be
filming
but
ignore
that
fact
just
look
into
the
back
of
the
camera
and
talk
to
it
as
though
it
were
me
hey
she
grinned
you
dealing
with
a
pro
this
is
my
thing
i
looked
around
at
the
cameras
and
the
grips
okay
guys
roll
sound
there
was
a
retort
as
the
clap
stick
used
for
synching
whacked
out
the
start
of
the
shoot
scene
one
take
one
carly
grove
interview
she
proceeded
to
hit
the
ground
running
recounting
in
great
detail
her
story
of
many
disappointments
she
finally
got
to
the
point
where
she
was
trying
to
adopt
the
baby
of
a
woman
in
a
memphis
jail
and
then
even
that
fell
through
which
was
when
my
main
lawyer
chuck
just
gave
up
and
recommended
i
hock
the
family
silver
take
a
valium
and
try
this
place
called
children
of
light
where
you
go
when
all
else
fails
so
i
gave
them
a
call
and
what
happened
it
sounded
too
good
to
be
true
did
they
seem
in
any
way
unusual
she
looked
at
me
as
though
puzzled
by
the
question
then
she
shrugged
it
off
well
first
they
tried
to
get
me
to
check
into
their
clinic
it
this
place
up
the
hudson
to
let
them
see
if
my
could
be
cured
somehow
using
his
special
techniques
his
goddard
alex
goddard
he
a
kinda
spacey
guy
but
he
the
presiding
guru
there
she
remembered
the
camera
and
turned
back
to
it
i
told
his
staff
i
did
have
that
kind
of
time
and
anyway
nothing
could
be
done
they
were
pretty
insistent
so
i
eventually
ended
up
talking
to
the
man
himself
he
sort
of
mesmerizes
you
but
i
finally
said
forget
it
it
adoption
or
nothing
so
he
just
sent
me
back
to
the
peons
checkbook
time
i
stared
at
her
hungry
for
details
but
she
did
notice
just
pressed
on
the
money
they
wanted
i
have
to
tell
you
was
staggering
sixty
thousand
and
believe
me
they
do
give
revolving
credit
i
thought
about
the
figure
it
was
the
highest
i
heard
for
getting
a
baby
but
it
was
totally
terrific
babies
do
drop
from
trees
carly
was
still
going
strong
it
took
me
almost
half
a
year
to
scrounge
it
together
a
lot
of
credit
lines
got
maxed
but
when
i
finally
did
plunk
down
the
loot
sure
enough
i
had
kevin
in
less
than
three
months
i
do
even
know
where
he
came
from
they
took
care
of
all
that
but
i
do
know
it
was
probably
out
of
the
country
because
of
the
blank
ins
forms
i
signed
but
then
who
cares
with
a
deal
this
good
you
do
press
for
details
right
carly
grove
had
a
mutual
love
affair
with
the
camera
the
footage
was
going
to
be
fabulous
the
only
problem
was
it
sounded
like
an
infomercial
for
the
adoption
miracle
wrought
by
this
doctor
named
goddard
when
the
interview
began
to
wind
down
losing
its
punch
i
suggested
we
call
it
a
day
with
the
time
pushing
two
i
wanted
to
get
the
film
to
the
lab
get
it
developed
and
take
a
look
at
the
rushes
i
also
had
a
doctor
appointment
not
to
mention
a
meeting
with
david
to
bring
him
up
to
speed
on
what
i
was
doing
but
surely
he
was
going
to
be
pleased
the
interview
with
carly
honest
intensity
would
give
the
picture
spine
and
guts
just
as
i
hoped
you
could
always
tell
by
the
reaction
of
the
crew
even
roger
drexel
who
usually
hid
his
thoughts
somewhere
in
his
scraggly
beard
was
letting
his
eyes
sparkle
behind
his
panaflex
scott
was
also
grinning
as
he
struck
the
lights
and
cafiero
ripped
up
the
power
lines
now
taped
to
the
floor
everybody
was
in
wrap
mode
flushed
with
a
great
shoot
i
followed
carly
into
the
kitchen
where
marcy
was
feeding
kevin
some
gerber
applesauce
the
time
had
come
i
thought
to
spring
the
next
big
question
out
of
earshot
of
the
crew
i
hate
to
put
you
on
the
spot
but
do
you
know
any
other
women
like
you
single
who
adopted
through
children
of
light
i
decided
to
experiment
with
the
truth
god
knows
depending
on
what
happens
in
my
own
situation
i
i
thinking
i
might
even
want
to
check
them
out
for
myself
what
do
you
mean
she
gave
me
a
quick
concerned
look
maybe
i
like
to
talk
to
them
about
adopting
too
i
realized
i
was
babbling
my
usual
prelude
to
obsessing
carly
worried
gaze
eased
up
a
bit
but
she
started
twisting
at
her
hair
well
i
might
have
another
name
when
my
lawyer
first
told
me
about
them
he
gave
me
the
name
of
another
woman
who
adopted
from
them
and
i
talked
to
her
a
little
about
how
they
worked
she
just
gotten
her
baby
so
i
guess
she
was
about
six
months
ahead
of
me
in
the
process
her
name
was
i
think
it
was
pauline
or
paula
or
something
probably
not
the
kind
of
person
who
take
their
disclosure
crap
all
that
seriously
she
was
adopting
a
girl
and
she
lives
somewhere
on
the
upper
west
side
any
idea
how
i
could
find
her
you
know
she
wrote
kids
books
and
i
think
she
gave
me
her
card
in
case
i
ever
needed
somebody
to
do
some
ya
copy
let
me
go
look
in
my
rolodex
i
filed
her
card
under
for
young
adult
right
it
just
take
a
second
the
woman
whose
name
was
paula
marks
lived
on
west
street
the
business
card
a
tasteful
brown
with
a
weave
in
the
paper
described
her
as
an
author
the
address
included
a
suite
number
which
meant
she
worked
out
of
her
apartment
mind
if
i
take
down
her
phone
number
and
address
i
really
like
to
look
her
up
to
see
if
her
experience
was
anything
remotely
like
yours
carly
gazed
at
her
fingernails
a
second
okay
but
do
me
a
favor
do
tell
her
how
you
got
her
number
she
bit
her
lip
stalling
it
one
thing
for
me
to
talk
to
you
myself
it
something
else
entirely
to
go
sticking
my
nose
into
other
people
business
look
i
respect
her
privacy
just
as
much
as
i
respect
yours
i
paused
listening
to
what
i
just
said
the
promise
sounded
pretty
lame
i
just
filmed
her
or
had
she
noticed
look
let
me
call
paula
see
if
she
agree
to
be
interviewed
on
camera
i
keep
your
name
entirely
out
if
it
i
promise
she
reached
down
and
plucked
kevin
out
of
his
high
chair
kissed
him
on
his
cheek
then
hugged
him
sorry
guess
i
being
a
little
paranoid
i
should
invite
you
here
then
give
you
a
hard
time
about
what
you
going
to
do
or
not
do
i
ca
have
it
both
ways
in
the
ensuing
tumult
and
confusion
of
the
wrap
i
did
manage
to
get
one
more
item
from
carly
grove
the
address
and
phone
number
of
children
of
light
but
i
completely
forgot
the
one
thing
i
been
meaning
to
ask
about
that
little
amulet
with
the
strange
cat
face
and
the
lines
and
dots
on
the
back
why
was
kevin
wearing
it
and
by
the
time
i
got
to
the
street
surrounded
by
the
clamor
of
crew
and
equipment
it
seemed
too
inconsequential
to
go
back
and
bother
with
chapter
two
moving
on
my
next
was
to
meet
with
my
young
boss
the
david
roth
who
was
ceo
and
first
operating
kvetcher
of
applecore
productions
a
guy
whose
heart
was
deeply
engaged
often
unsuccessfully
with
bottom
lines
the
issue
was
i
done
today
shoot
the
interview
with
carly
without
troubling
to
secure
his
okay
without
in
fact
telling
him
zip
the
reason
being
i
was
afraid
he
would
the
idea
now
my
next
move
was
to
try
to
convince
him
what
i
just
done
was
brilliant
actually
i
liked
david
a
lot
and
hoped
the
occasional
tangles
we
had
over
the
film
would
stand
in
the
way
of
a
friendship
the
truth
is
you
do
meet
that
many
interesting
stable
men
in
my
line
of
work
our
artistic
goals
were
always
in
sync
but
all
the
same
he
done
an
enormous
favor
for
somebody
close
to
me
and
for
that
i
vowed
to
walk
through
fire
for
him
when
i
marched
into
his
cluttered
dimly
lit
office
my
mind
still
churning
over
carly
strange
adoption
story
what
i
saw
sent
my
straight
into
the
red
there
sitting
across
from
him
was
nicholas
russo
a
smoothie
in
a
charcoal
brioni
the
gentleman
david
sometimes
referred
to
as
nicky
the
purse
another
land
mine
in
my
life
he
operated
off
and
on
as
applecore
banker
when
cash
flow
got
dicey
and
real
banks
got
nervous
it
was
an
arrangement
of
last
resort
since
nicky
loans
had
to
be
serviced
at
two
percent
a
week
do
the
numbers
he
doubled
his
money
in
a
year
i
knew
too
that
putting
money
out
to
independent
filmmakers
was
part
of
nicky
attempt
at
a
legitimate
front
the
real
cash
went
onto
the
streets
of
hell
kitchen
just
outside
our
door
where
he
got
five
percent
a
week
and
nicky
overdue
notices
were
not
sent
through
the
mail
he
also
had
a
piece
of
a
video
distributorship
roma
exotics
that
reputedly
specialized
in
guess
what
it
was
all
stuff
i
tried
not
to
think
about
i
had
a
strong
hunch
what
was
under
discussion
the
david
had
borrowed
to
finish
my
picture
we
gotten
the
loan
three
months
ago
when
cash
was
tight
and
we
both
figured
we
could
pay
it
back
later
in
the
year
after
we
got
a
backup
cable
deal
though
i
was
ultimately
hoping
for
a
theatrical
distribution
my
first
shit
what
did
nicky
want
were
we
behind
on
the
weekly
juice
signed
on
with
david
partly
to
help
his
bottom
line
was
i
instead
going
to
cause
his
ruin
at
the
moment
he
had
his
back
to
nicky
seemed
to
be
meditating
out
the
window
he
loved
its
vista
being
the
grimy
facades
that
lined
the
far
west
of
street
his
office
with
its
wide
windows
and
forest
of
freshly
misted
trees
told
you
he
was
a
plant
nut
outside
it
was
early
april
the
cruelest
month
but
inside
with
all
the
trees
spring
was
in
full
cry
the
place
also
felt
like
a
storage
room
with
piles
of
scripts
stacked
around
every
pot
the
office
normally
smelled
like
a
greenhouse
but
now
the
aroma
was
one
of
high
anxiety
david
revolved
back
and
looked
across
the
potted
greenery
then
broke
into
a
relieved
smile
when
he
saw
me
i
could
tell
from
his
faraway
stare
that
he
was
teetering
on
the
verge
of
panic
hey
come
on
in
he
said
nicky
just
put
a
proposition
on
the
table
david
had
a
keen
intelligence
causing
me
to
sometimes
wonder
if
he
was
in
a
line
of
work
beneath
him
for
that
matter
maybe
i
was
too
he
was
trim
with
serious
gray
eyes
and
strong
cheekbones
this
morning
he
was
wearing
his
trademark
black
sweater
jeans
and
white
sneakers
a
picture
of
the
serious
new
york
hustler
he
already
made
and
lost
and
made
several
fortunes
in
his
youthful
career
my
only
sexual
solace
since
steve
left
was
an
occasional
glance
at
his
trim
rear
end
i
also
saluted
his
fiscal
courage
his
congenital
shortfall
i
regret
to
say
was
in
the
matter
of
judgment
exhibit
a
nicholas
russo
funny
money
nicky
you
remember
morgan
james
the
director
on
this
project
yeah
we
met
four
months
back
nicky
rose
and
offered
his
manicured
hand
a
picture
of
old
world
charm
his
dark
hair
was
parted
down
the
middle
and
his
brioni
which
probably
fell
off
a
truck
somewhere
in
the
garment
center
had
buttons
on
the
cuffs
that
actually
buttoned
how
ya
doing
hi
i
disengaged
myself
as
quickly
as
possible
the
slimeball
again
why
was
he
here
the
way
i
understood
it
we
signed
a
legitimate
ironclad
note
nicky
was
exactly
the
chase
manhattan
bank
but
i
assumed
he
was
a
man
of
honor
would
live
by
any
deal
david
had
with
him
do
we
have
some
kind
of
problem
nah
nicky
said
i
thinking
of
it
more
in
the
way
of
an
opportunity
dave
here
showed
me
some
of
your
picture
this
morning
and
it
ai
too
bad
got
me
to
thinking
you
gon
na
need
a
video
distributor
so
maybe
i
could
help
you
out
oh
shit
and
i
looked
at
him
realizing
what
he
had
in
mind
how
that
applecore
already
has
a
video
distributor
we
use
yeah
well
like
i
was
telling
dave
i
got
a
nose
this
picture
gon
na
do
some
serious
business
he
tried
a
smile
whenever
i
see
one
of
these
indy
things
that
do
add
up
for
me
like
this
one
i
always
know
it
a
winner
what
i
telling
you
is
i
think
you
got
something
here
he
says
you
figuring
on
a
cable
deal
and
maybe
a
theatrical
release
but
after
that
you
got
ta
worry
about
video
i
just
thinking
a
way
i
could
pitch
in
pitch
in
the
last
thing
i
needed
was
some
wiseguy
getting
his
sticky
hands
on
my
picture
forget
about
it
well
i
do
really
see
how
i
shooting
this
one
by
the
book
got
a
standard
screen
actors
guild
contract
and
everything
is
strictly
by
the
rules
if
we
current
on
the
loan
then
i
looked
at
david
who
appeared
to
be
running
on
empty
maybe
i
thought
i
understand
what
was
at
stake
what
had
nicky
said
to
him
this
was
a
man
who
could
make
people
disappear
with
a
phone
call
to
guys
nicknamed
after
body
parts
look
let
me
talk
to
david
about
this
i
do
know
what
you
two
just
gon
na
about
it
russo
penetrating
eyes
dimmed
now
that
a
little
disappointing
i
got
ta
tell
you
since
i
sent
for
my
business
manager
eddie
down
there
in
the
car
hoping
we
could
reach
a
meeting
of
minds
right
here
sign
a
few
things
roll
that
note
i
holding
into
a
distribution
deal
and
give
everybody
one
less
worry
he
turned
in
his
chair
boring
in
on
me
like
for
instance
i
checked
out
your
locations
and
i
noticed
there
ai
no
teamsters
nowhere
all
you
got
a
bunch
of
fuckin
mick
scabs
driving
them
vans
now
that
can
lead
to
circumstances
inadequate
safety
procedures
of
course
that
would
have
to
be
a
concern
if
we
was
partners
together
then
you
have
good
security
the
best
i
looked
at
david
who
seemed
on
the
verge
of
a
heart
attack
why
was
he
letting
this
even
be
discussed
get
in
bed
with
nicky
russo
and
the
next
thing
you
know
he
got
somebody
hanging
you
out
the
window
by
your
ankles
besides
ten
to
one
the
guy
was
bluffing
seeing
if
he
could
scare
us
i
refocused
russo
it
may
ease
your
mind
to
know
that
our
security
is
managed
by
a
former
agent
for
the
fbi
he
was
with
them
here
in
new
york
till
about
a
year
ago
when
he
came
to
us
full
time
his
name
is
agent
lou
crenshaw
you
welcome
to
check
him
out
familiar
with
union
issues
and
he
carries
a
he
also
has
plenty
of
friends
down
at
federal
plaza
so
if
you
have
any
lingering
concern
about
our
security
procedures
why
do
you
run
it
by
him
the
mention
of
lou
seemed
to
brighten
david
listless
eyes
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
almost
smiled
he
had
good
reason
the
favor
he
done
for
lou
and
indirectly
for
me
was
enough
to
inspire
eternal
loyalty
lou
would
face
off
against
half
of
hell
kitchen
for
david
roth
that
ai
the
point
exactly
russo
said
shifting
uncomfortably
thing
is
roma
could
do
good
distribution
for
you
we
work
with
a
lot
of
people
then
why
not
submit
a
formal
proposal
in
writing
i
in
charge
and
that
how
i
do
business
if
your
numbers
work
then
we
can
talk
just
trying
to
be
helpful
he
glared
at
me
then
seemed
to
dismiss
my
presence
i
disappeared
from
his
radar
as
though
lifted
away
by
an
alien
spacecraft
and
he
turned
back
to
david
you
know
dave
me
and
you
kinda
drifted
apart
lately
old
friends
do
that
we
ought
to
keep
more
in
touch
i
think
we
get
along
okay
in
other
words
get
this
pushy
broad
out
of
my
face
it
just
business
nicky
david
said
trying
to
conjure
an
empty
smile
business
and
pleasure
do
always
mix
yes
david
tell
the
creep
to
leave
us
alone
tell
him
doing
business
with
me
ai
a
pleasure
nicky
russo
asked
hurt
filling
his
voice
he
brought
out
a
large
havana
and
was
rolling
it
in
between
his
thumb
and
forefinger
i
figured
we
was
best
friends
we
not
friends
nicky
we
just
got
different
goals
in
life
you
know
how
it
is
i
worked
my
way
around
behind
his
desk
and
glanced
out
the
window
the
lingering
day
was
beginning
to
cloud
over
a
perfect
match
for
my
state
of
mind
after
this
i
had
a
late
appointment
with
hannah
klein
i
feared
she
was
going
to
end
my
baby
hopes
yeah
well
nicky
russo
said
finally
rising
i
got
ta
be
downtown
in
a
little
while
so
i
guess
we
can
talk
about
this
later
okay
sure
david
made
a
shrugging
sign
like
women
what
can
you
do
then
he
got
up
too
look
nicky
let
me
chew
on
this
maybe
get
back
to
you
yeah
you
think
about
it
all
right
he
rose
without
a
further
word
and
worked
his
way
out
the
wide
double
doors
stumbling
through
the
ficus
forest
as
he
struck
a
match
to
his
cigar
david
do
sign
anything
with
him
do
i
handle
the
teamster
stuff
if
it
comes
up
i
know
how
to
talk
to
them
okay
okay
calm
down
he
was
just
seeing
if
he
could
push
me
i
know
him
you
called
his
scam
with
that
talk
about
lou
by
tomorrow
forget
about
the
whole
thing
he
looked
at
me
his
eyes
not
quite
yet
back
in
focus
thanks
you
can
say
things
to
him
i
get
cement
shoes
for
nicky
not
really
ready
for
people
like
you
he
has
this
macho
front
but
he
does
know
how
to
handle
a
professional
woman
with
balls
you
welcome
i
guess
balls
i
adored
those
vulnerable
male
bits
but
i
preferred
not
to
think
of
myself
in
those
terms
truth
was
nicky
russo
played
a
large
part
in
my
personal
anxieties
but
i
mean
it
n
o
i
hear
you
he
said
sighing
then
he
snapped
back
to
the
moment
so
where
do
things
stand
otherwise
i
come
for
an
green
light
of
the
day
shoot
but
already
i
was
thinking
about
hannah
klein
david
i
going
to
find
out
in
about
an
hour
whether
steve
and
i
are
ever
going
to
have
a
baby
but
truthfully
i
do
think
i
pregnant
i
think
it
over
it
hurt
to
say
it
he
knew
about
steve
and
me
i
written
some
language
on
maternity
leave
into
my
contract
and
i
think
he
was
mildly
rooting
for
us
or
maybe
not
could
be
it
all
for
the
best
he
declared
he
sat
back
down
picked
up
a
pencil
off
his
desk
to
distract
himself
and
was
whirling
it
pensively
one
of
his
few
habits
that
made
me
crazy
maybe
you
were
destined
to
make
movies
not
kids
i
listened
to
his
tone
of
voice
knowing
he
often
hid
his
real
feelings
with
safe
sentiments
he
rose
to
eloquence
only
when
nothing
much
was
at
stake
he
even
sent
me
flowers
and
a
note
twice
as
a
makeup
after
we
had
a
disagreement
over
costs
and
scheduling
and
one
of
those
times
i
should
have
sent
him
flowers
sometimes
i
wondered
why
we
worked
so
well
together
the
truth
was
we
operated
on
very
different
wavelengths
some
history
to
illustrate
over
the
past
eight
years
before
i
teamed
up
with
david
i
done
three
highly
praised
documentaries
but
getting
to
that
point
meant
busting
my
behind
for
years
and
years
at
the
lower
end
of
the
professional
food
chain
after
nyu
i
toiled
as
a
script
supervisor
on
pbs
documentaries
about
as
close
to
grunt
work
as
it
comes
eventually
i
got
a
fling
as
a
production
assistant
assembling
crews
but
then
the
money
dried
up
thank
you
jesse
helms
whereupon
i
decided
to
try
capitalism
working
for
three
years
as
an
ad
on
the
soaps
first
guiding
light
then
as
the
world
turns
then
search
for
tomorrow
i
can
still
hear
the
horrible
music
then
a
connection
got
me
a
slot
at
a
e
as
a
line
producer
eight
months
later
the
series
got
canceled
which
was
when
i
decided
the
time
had
come
to
take
my
career
into
my
own
hands
i
hocked
every
last
credit
card
went
to
japan
and
made
a
documentary
the
result
i
was
an
overnight
success
men
started
addressing
me
by
my
name
my
first
film
was
about
the
impact
of
zen
on
japanese
business
as
part
of
my
research
i
shaved
my
head
and
lived
three
months
at
a
kyoto
temple
eating
bean
curd
three
meals
a
day
after
which
i
had
enough
credibility
to
land
long
interviews
with
tokyo
ceos
i
then
sold
the
edited
footage
to
a
e
when
it
became
a
critical
hit
they
financed
a
second
film
about
the
many
gods
of
india
and
how
they
impact
everything
about
the
place
there
i
also
got
caught
up
in
the
mystical
sensuality
of
ragas
indian
classical
music
and
took
up
the
violin
one
of
my
major
professional
mistakes
next
i
moved
on
to
southern
yucatan
to
film
a
day
in
the
life
of
a
maya
village
for
the
discovery
channel
they
wanted
me
to
add
some
footage
from
guatemala
but
i
scouted
the
country
and
decided
it
was
too
scary
instead
i
spent
several
months
in
haiti
filming
voodoo
rituals
again
for
a
e
and
met
steve
then
one
day
i
checked
my
bank
account
and
realized
that
financially
speaking
i
was
a
flop
i
was
doing
the
kind
of
work
that
does
more
for
your
reputation
than
your
retirement
plan
i
decided
to
go
more
mainstream
and
see
what
happened
but
to
do
that
i
needed
a
commercial
partner
a
backer
ironically
enough
when
i
first
teamed
up
with
david
he
had
problems
too
but
from
the
opposite
direction
he
was
busy
disproving
the
adage
that
nobody
ever
lost
money
underestimating
the
taste
of
the
american
public
he
knew
something
was
wrong
but
what
apparently
when
he
started
out
somebody
told
him
cable
audiences
possessed
an
insatiable
appetite
for
hey
he
figured
that
stuff
he
could
grind
out
in
his
sleep
his
first
and
last
epic
in
the
skin
genre
was
whose
title
says
it
all
he
explained
the
economics
to
me
once
still
baffled
why
the
picture
had
worked
he
assumed
all
you
had
to
do
was
find
a
bunch
of
who
looked
like
they
sixteen
go
nonunion
someplace
down
south
with
a
beach
and
take
care
the
wardrobe
trailer
has
nothing
but
string
bikinis
cost
only
a
to
make
he
declared
with
pride
but
every
penny
is
on
the
screen
he
insisted
i
watch
it
perplexed
that
it
was
universally
regarded
as
a
turkey
it
was
a
painful
experience
so
much
so
i
actually
began
to
wonder
if
his
heart
was
really
in
it
the
great
schlockmeisters
secretly
think
they
fellini
they
operating
at
the
top
of
their
form
not
consciously
pandering
chastened
financially
he
decided
to
move
into
his
efforts
most
notably
had
car
chases
explosions
buckets
of
fake
blood
somebody
died
creatively
in
every
scene
they
did
business
in
asia
and
southern
europe
but
he
was
dumbfounded
when
nobody
at
hbo
or
showtime
would
return
his
calls
it
gnawed
at
his
that
was
the
moment
we
found
each
other
he
just
concluded
he
needed
somebody
with
a
quality
reputation
to
give
applecore
an
image
makeover
and
i
realized
i
needed
somebody
who
knew
more
than
i
did
about
the
mechanics
of
making
and
distributing
independent
films
we
were
an
odd
couple
i
finally
shook
hands
on
the
partnership
after
he
caved
in
and
agreed
i
could
do
anything
i
wanted
so
long
as
it
looked
mainstream
enough
to
get
picked
up
by
or
somebody
else
legit
well
we
both
agreed
on
no
more
bikinis
and
no
more
films
about
places
that
required
cholera
shots
it
was
something
of
a
compromise
on
both
our
parts
thus
far
though
we
were
getting
along
maybe
luck
was
part
of
it
but
love
still
on
schedule
and
on
budget
and
i
already
had
a
deal
nearly
in
the
bag
with
lifetime
the
women
channel
that
would
just
about
cover
the
costs
everything
after
that
would
be
gravy
again
hope
hope
maybe
not
the
theatrical
release
i
been
praying
for
but
good
enough
so
he
had
to
smile
and
not
give
me
a
hard
time
about
the
money
i
just
spent
had
to
right
i
took
a
deep
breath
david
i
did
a
little
extra
shooting
this
morning
that
kind
of
outside
the
plan
but
it
really
important
want
to
hear
about
it
what
i
thought
you
were
finished
with
principal
photography
he
looked
disoriented
the
deer
in
the
headlights
hints
of
extra
crew
time
always
had
that
effect
on
him
you
saying
this
was
in
the
budget
just
listen
first
okay
like
a
politician
i
avoided
giving
him
a
direct
answer
i
told
him
about
the
interview
with
carly
and
the
reason
for
it
nice
of
you
to
share
the
news
with
me
his
eyes
narrowed
i
think
we
got
some
communication
issues
here
look
do
worry
i
figure
out
how
to
save
some
money
somewhere
else
morgy
before
we
continue
this
unnerving
conversation
we
got
to
have
a
serious
review
of
the
matter
of
cash
flow
he
frowned
then
went
back
to
whirling
the
pencil
his
hair
backlighted
from
the
wide
window
his
eyes
focused
on
its
stubby
eraser
as
though
he
just
discovered
a
new
strain
of
bacteria
so
let
me
break
some
news
regarding
the
current
budget
he
put
down
the
pencil
adjusted
its
location
on
his
desk
and
looked
up
i
did
want
to
have
to
upset
you
since
the
picture
seems
to
be
going
so
well
but
we
drawn
down
almost
all
our
cash
i
actually
think
that
why
nicky
was
here
today
sniffing
around
wanting
to
see
a
rough
cut
he
got
a
keen
nose
for
indy
trouble
what
are
you
saying
it
was
unsettling
to
see
david
turning
so
serious
are
we
i
saying
we
can
cover
the
payroll
here
all
our
fixed
nut
even
nicky
vig
for
maybe
six
more
weeks
if
you
and
i
do
pay
ourselves
of
course
if
we
can
get
an
advance
on
some
kind
of
cable
deal
that
would
tide
us
over
more
comfortably
till
this
thing
is
in
the
can
but
right
now
we
sailing
pretty
close
on
the
wind
i
bet
applecore
on
your
picture
morgan
we
ca
screw
this
up
i
swallowed
hard
i
knew
we
were
working
on
the
edge
but
i
did
know
the
edge
was
down
to
six
weeks
david
i
all
but
ready
for
postproduction
i
just
thinking
i
may
need
one
more
interview
just
a
shoot
i
going
to
make
this
picture
work
you
see
he
sighed
all
right
if
you
think
it
essential
get
the
footage
maybe
i
can
even
shake
another
fifty
out
of
nicky
if
i
string
him
along
about
the
distribution
deal
do
look
so
alarmed
i
wo
go
through
with
it
anyway
i
can
tell
he
impressed
with
the
picture
so
far
happy
now
no
i
was
happy
what
was
i
going
to
do
if
hannah
klein
had
bad
news
adoption
i
finally
was
facing
the
fact
i
possibly
been
making
a
movie
about
myself
all
this
time
like
yeats
penning
his
own
tombstone
cast
a
cold
eye
on
life
on
death
so
why
not
give
him
the
whole
story
david
if
it
turns
out
steve
and
i
ca
have
a
baby
i
begun
thinking
about
trying
to
adopt
there
it
was
more
pain
maybe
about
to
become
the
heroine
of
my
own
picture
he
stared
at
me
incredulously
morgy
you
of
all
people
should
know
by
now
that
adopting
would
take
up
all
your
energy
like
a
giant
sponge
come
on
i
seen
your
dailies
i
got
it
about
how
hard
it
is
you
telling
me
now
you
get
it
he
was
right
righter
than
he
realized
but
then
i
thought
again
about
carly
grove
who
found
kevin
in
no
time
at
all
with
zero
hassles
the
only
troubling
part
was
that
it
was
all
so
mysterious
after
i
left
david
office
i
remembered
i
had
actually
had
lunch
so
i
grabbed
two
hot
dogs
with
sauerkraut
okay
it
was
junk
but
i
secretly
loved
kosher
franks
and
a
diet
pepsi
to
go
from
one
of
the
vendors
then
hailed
a
cab
clutching
the
grungy
brown
bag
i
was
heading
for
hannah
klein
office
on
the
upper
west
side
and
now
i
had
another
clock
ticking
in
addition
to
the
biological
one
the
big
money
clock
in
the
sky
was
suddenly
on
final
countdown
chapter
three
it
took
only
a
few
minutes
for
hannah
klein
assistant
lori
to
run
the
pregnancy
test
that
confirmed
my
suspicions
and
settled
my
future
steve
and
my
final
attempt
another
intrauterine
insemination
iui
for
an
expensive
turkey
baster
with
the
last
of
his
deposit
had
failed
the
end
the
bitter
end
morgan
hannah
declared
staring
over
her
desk
her
raspy
new
york
voice
boring
through
me
like
a
drill
given
how
this
has
all
turned
out
maybe
you
ought
to
just
start
considering
adoption
if
having
a
child
still
means
that
much
to
you
hannah
klein
was
pushing
seventy
a
chain
smoker
who
should
have
been
dead
a
decade
ago
and
she
unfailingly
spoke
the
truth
her
gaze
carried
only
synthetic
solace
but
i
was
probably
her
fifteenth
patient
of
the
day
and
maybe
she
was
running
low
on
empathy
oddly
though
sitting
there
in
her
office
miserable
i
felt
strangely
liberated
i
adored
the
woman
a
child
of
the
holocaust
with
layers
of
steel
like
a
samurai
sword
but
i
also
loved
the
thought
of
never
again
having
to
go
through
the
humiliation
of
cowering
in
her
office
chair
like
a
student
on
probation
waiting
to
receive
my
failing
grade
it
was
now
time
to
come
to
grips
with
what
i
known
in
my
heart
for
a
long
time
god
had
made
me
a
theoretically
functional
reproductive
machine
that
just
would
kick
over
translation
no
cysts
fibroids
polyps
no
ovulatory
abnormalities
my
uterus
and
fallopian
tubes
were
just
fine
steve
sperm
counts
were
okay
but
no
baby
was
swimming
into
life
inside
me
sometimes
however
reality
asks
too
much
it
not
easy
getting
your
mind
around
the
idea
that
some
part
of
your
life
is
over
finally
over
the
baby
part
to
admit
that
it
time
to
move
on
to
plan
b
whatever
that
is
such
realizations
can
take
a
while
especially
if
you
been
living
with
hope
no
matter
how
irrational
i
frankly
do
know
what
else
we
can
do
she
went
on
projecting
through
my
abyss
of
gloom
she
was
shuffling
papers
on
her
desk
white
hair
in
a
bun
grit
in
her
voice
upper
west
side
a
fixture
she
never
wore
perfume
but
to
me
she
always
smelled
faintly
of
roses
mixed
with
smoke
earthy
aside
from
trying
in
vitro
we
already
discussed
that
but
it
was
definitely
the
bottom
level
of
hell
besides
i
was
running
out
of
money
and
spirit
and
now
with
steve
gone
the
whole
idea
seemed
moot
anyway
so
she
concluded
barring
that
we
done
everything
possible
run
every
test
there
is
both
on
you
and
on
your
steve
i
inserted
into
her
pause
she
seemed
to
deliberately
block
his
name
at
crucial
moments
maybe
she
thought
i
could
have
done
better
maybe
a
nice
solid
dentist
who
owned
a
suit
instead
of
some
freelance
photo
jock
who
showed
up
for
his
sperm
counts
wearing
khaki
safari
shirts
well
let
her
deal
with
it
and
i
ca
find
anything
sometimes
the
body
just
cooperate
we
may
never
know
why
you
got
to
face
that
but
still
adoption
is
always
an
option
adoption
all
along
i
told
myself
i
did
have
the
courage
or
the
heart
making
movies
is
a
job
not
leaving
time
to
go
filling
out
forms
and
jumping
through
hoops
for
years
and
years
and
to
cap
it
off
i
was
just
two
years
short
of
the
big
and
financially
struggling
hardly
an
adoption
agency
profile
of
ideal
but
now
now
i
just
discovered
carly
grove
and
the
miracle
of
children
of
light
so
maybe
there
really
could
be
a
way
to
adopt
a
beautiful
child
with
no
hassles
maybe
it
would
simplify
everything
to
the
point
i
could
actually
pull
it
off
could
this
be
my
plan
b
then
what
if
steve
came
back
could
we
be
a
family
finally
i
was
used
to
being
that
lucky
and
i
still
wanted
hannah
thoughts
a
reality
test
which
was
why
i
pressed
her
on
the
point
truthfully
do
you
think
adopting
is
really
a
workable
idea
for
somebody
like
me
would
i
morgan
i
know
you
making
a
film
about
the
realities
of
the
adoption
process
we
both
realize
it
not
easy
she
must
have
seen
something
needful
in
my
eyes
because
she
continued
on
adding
detail
letting
the
facts
convey
the
bad
news
as
you
well
aware
finding
a
young
healthy
american
baby
nowadays
is
all
but
impossible
at
the
very
least
it
can
take
years
she
was
fiddling
with
some
papers
on
her
desk
avoiding
my
eyes
then
she
stubbed
out
her
cigarette
in
a
gesture
that
seemed
intended
to
gain
time
and
even
if
you
willing
to
take
a
baby
that
there
still
can
be
plenty
of
heartbreak
that
just
how
it
is
i
always
thought
so
too
i
said
it
actually
the
underlying
motif
of
my
picture
but
today
i
had
an
incredible
experience
i
filmed
an
interview
of
a
single
woman
early
forties
who
just
adopted
a
baby
boy
it
took
less
than
three
months
and
he
blond
and
and
perfect
i
saw
him
i
held
him
and
i
can
assure
you
he
as
american
as
peach
cobbler
the
way
she
tells
it
the
whole
adoption
process
was
a
snap
zero
hassles
and
red
tape
that
most
exceptional
she
peered
at
me
dubiously
actually
more
like
impossible
frankly
i
do
believe
it
this
child
must
have
been
kidnapped
or
something
how
old
exactly
was
he
when
she
got
him
i
do
know
just
a
few
weeks
i
think
her
eyes
bored
in
this
woman
whoever
she
is
was
very
very
lucky
if
what
she
says
is
true
the
organization
that
got
the
baby
for
her
is
called
children
of
light
i
went
on
that
all
i
know
really
i
think
it
up
the
hudson
somewhere
past
the
cloisters
have
you
ever
heard
of
them
hannah
klein
i
knew
was
pushing
three
score
and
ten
had
traveled
the
world
seen
virtually
everything
worth
seeing
in
younger
years
she
was
reputed
to
have
had
torrid
liaisons
with
every
notable
european
writer
on
the
west
side
her
list
of
conquests
read
like
an
old
new
yorker
masthead
if
only
i
looked
half
that
great
at
her
age
but
whatever
else
she
was
unflappable
good
news
or
bad
she
took
it
and
gave
it
with
grace
until
this
moment
her
eyes
registered
undisguised
dismay
you
ca
mean
it
not
that
place
all
that
new
age
are
you
really
sure
you
want
to
get
involved
in
something
like
that
i
found
myself
deeply
confused
were
we
talking
about
the
same
thing
then
i
remembered
carly
had
said
something
about
an
infertility
clinic
frankly
nobody
knows
the
first
thing
about
that
man
hannah
raged
on
all
you
get
is
hearsay
he
supposedly
one
of
those
types
and
a
few
people
claim
he
had
some
success
but
it
all
anecdotal
my
own
opinion
is
it
what
real
physicians
call
the
effect
if
a
patient
believes
hard
enough
something
will
happen
some
of
the
time
it
actually
might
for
sake
i
not
even
sure
he
do
yourself
a
favor
and
stay
away
oftentimes
people
like
that
do
more
harm
than
good
then
her
look
turned
inquisitive
did
you
say
he
providing
children
for
adoption
now
that
peculiar
when
did
he
start
that
was
i
hearing
some
kind
of
professional
jealousy
slipping
out
hannah
klein
was
definitely
old
school
to
the
core
he
who
i
was
trying
to
remember
the
name
of
the
doctor
carly
had
mentioned
you
mean
he
says
his
name
is
what
goddard
yes
alex
goddard
he
my
pager
chirped
interrupting
her
and
she
paused
clearly
annoyed
i
looked
down
to
see
a
number
i
knew
well
it
had
to
be
lou
crenshaw
our
aforementioned
security
guard
he
been
off
today
but
there
was
only
one
reason
he
would
page
me
some
kind
of
news
from
lenox
hill
maybe
it
was
good
news
about
sarah
my
hopes
soared
or
maybe
it
was
bad
please
dear
god
i
sorry
klein
i
got
to
go
right
now
it
could
be
a
medical
emergency
she
nodded
then
slid
open
the
top
drawer
of
her
desk
and
handed
me
a
list
of
adoption
agencies
all
right
here
take
this
and
look
it
over
i
dealt
with
some
of
them
letters
of
reference
for
patients
like
you
she
must
have
realized
the
insensitivity
of
that
last
quip
because
she
took
my
hand
and
squeezed
it
the
closest
we
ever
come
to
intimacy
let
me
know
if
i
can
help
you
morgan
really
grasping
the
lifeless
paper
i
ached
for
steve
all
over
again
times
like
this
you
need
some
support
i
finally
glanced
down
at
the
list
as
i
headed
out
sure
enough
children
of
light
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
why
not
i
wondered
they
found
kevin
a
lovely
blond
baby
boy
for
carly
a
single
woman
in
no
time
at
all
they
sounded
like
and
if
there
was
ever
a
moment
for
miracles
this
was
it
should
they
at
least
have
been
given
a
footnote
i
wanted
to
stalk
right
back
and
demand
to
know
the
real
reason
she
was
so
upset
but
i
truly
did
want
to
waste
a
moment
lou
had
paged
me
from
a
pay
phone
he
did
actually
have
a
cell
phone
of
his
own
and
i
recognized
the
number
as
belonging
to
the
phone
next
to
the
lenox
hill
hospital
nurses
station
when
i
tried
it
however
it
was
busy
so
i
decided
to
just
get
in
my
car
and
drive
there
as
fast
as
i
could
and
as
i
battled
the
traffic
down
broadway
i
realized
that
by
diverting
my
mind
from
my
own
trivial
misery
to
the
genuine
tragedy
of
sarah
i
was
actually
getting
my
perspective
back
that
was
one
of
the
many
things
sarah
had
done
for
me
over
the
years
all
right
sarah
and
lou
who
figure
so
largely
in
this
deserve
a
introduction
so
obviously
i
should
start
by
admitting
known
them
all
my
life
lou
was
my
mother
half
brother
three
years
younger
than
she
was
who
came
along
after
my
grandfather
widowed
my
grandmother
in
a
freak
tractor
rollover
and
she
remarried
a
lifelong
bachelor
neighbor
i
have
old
snapshots
of
them
and
i
can
tell
you
they
all
were
cheerless
american
gothics
i
arranged
for
david
to
hire
lou
eight
months
earlier
not
too
long
after
i
came
to
applecore
at
that
time
he
just
taken
early
retirement
from
the
fbi
because
of
an
event
that
shook
us
all
up
pretty
seriously
for
some
time
now
lou
been
a
rumpled
willy
loman
figure
like
a
traveling
salesman
on
the
skids
shirts
frayed
at
the
collars
face
tinted
from
a
truckload
of
early
times
over
the
past
fifteen
years
watched
his
waist
size
travel
from
about
inches
to
and
i
guess
it
been
at
least
a
decade
since
a
barber
asked
him
if
he
needed
any
off
the
top
natalie
rose
his
spirited
wiry
wife
of
years
succumbed
to
ovarian
cancer
seven
years
ago
last
september
and
i
know
for
a
fact
she
was
the
one
who
bought
his
shirts
provided
him
with
general
maintenance
my
first
memories
of
him
were
when
he
was
a
county
sheriff
in
a
little
burg
called
coleman
smack
in
the
middle
of
texas
some
long
dusty
miles
from
the
ranch
where
i
grew
up
when
i
was
about
fourteen
i
remember
he
gave
up
on
that
and
moved
to
dallas
there
to
enter
training
for
the
fbi
he
eventually
ended
up
in
new
orleans
and
then
after
natalie
rose
passed
away
and
he
more
or
less
fell
apart
he
got
transferred
to
new
york
considered
the
elephant
graveyard
of
an
fbi
career
probably
the
reason
i
saw
him
as
much
as
i
did
as
a
kid
was
because
of
my
cousin
sarah
his
and
rose
only
child
she
was
six
years
younger
than
me
a
lot
when
you
kids
but
we
were
very
special
to
each
other
had
a
kind
of
bonding
that
i
never
really
known
with
anybody
since
we
spent
a
lot
of
time
staying
at
each
other
house
me
the
and
truthfully
i
loved
her
helplessly
like
a
little
sister
i
always
wanted
to
think
she
needed
me
which
can
be
the
most
affirming
feeling
in
the
world
i
do
know
i
needed
her
she
was
now
lying
in
a
coma
and
the
way
she
got
there
was
the
tragedy
of
my
life
and
lou
to
begin
with
though
let
me
say
sarah
was
a
pretty
blonde
from
the
start
with
sunshiny
hair
that
defined
her
as
perpetually
optimistic
and
who
would
be
given
the
heads
she
always
turned
i
was
am
blond
too
though
with
eyes
more
gray
than
her
turquoise
blues
but
for
me
blond
always
been
on
balance
an
affliction
sexist
film
producers
assume
dammit
that
you
a
failed
showgirl
or
worse
i
actually
dyed
it
brunette
from
time
to
time
in
hopes
of
being
taken
more
seriously
sarah
and
i
had
always
had
our
own
special
chemistry
like
a
composite
of
opposites
to
make
a
complete
whole
human
being
whereas
i
was
the
rational
slave
of
the
concrete
she
was
a
dweller
in
a
world
of
for
years
and
years
she
seemed
to
live
in
a
dream
universe
of
her
own
making
one
of
imagination
and
fanciful
states
once
when
she
was
five
lou
hid
in
his
woodworking
shop
for
a
month
and
made
an
elaborate
cutaway
dollhouse
to
give
her
at
christmas
but
when
i
offered
to
help
her
find
little
dolls
that
would
fit
into
it
she
declared
she
only
wanted
angels
to
live
there
so
we
spent
the
rest
of
the
winter
i
dropped
everything
hunting
down
christmas
tree
ornaments
that
looked
like
heavenly
creatures
she
swathe
them
in
tinsel
and
sit
them
in
balls
of
cotton
she
said
were
little
clouds
i
always
felt
that
just
being
around
her
opened
my
life
to
new
dimensions
but
her
dream
existence
constantly
drove
lou
and
rose
to
distraction
i
think
it
was
one
of
the
reasons
he
never
got
as
close
to
her
as
he
wanted
and
his
feelings
about
that
were
deep
frustration
and
hurt
he
loved
her
so
much
but
he
could
never
really
find
a
common
wavelength
finally
she
came
down
to
earth
enough
to
start
college
and
eventually
she
graduated
from
smu
in
biology
then
enrolled
at
columbia
for
premed
by
then
she
was
interested
in
the
workings
of
the
brain
in
altered
states
i
did
know
if
it
was
just
more
pursuit
of
fantasy
but
at
least
she
was
going
about
it
professionally
anyway
when
lou
got
transferred
to
new
york
he
was
actually
delighted
since
it
gave
him
a
chance
to
be
closer
to
her
we
all
managed
to
get
together
for
family
reunions
pretty
often
though
lou
and
sarah
were
talking
past
each
other
half
the
time
then
tragedy
struck
she
was
just
finishing
her
master
and
had
been
accepted
by
cornell
medical
lou
was
bursting
with
pride
when
he
suggested
they
use
her
christmas
break
to
drive
back
down
to
texas
together
there
to
visit
rose
grave
i
think
he
really
wanted
to
show
off
his
budding
to
the
family
sarah
was
driving
when
they
crossed
the
state
line
into
louisiana
and
were
by
a
huge
mack
which
was
in
the
process
of
jackknifing
across
a
frozen
patch
of
interstate
they
were
thrown
into
the
path
of
an
oncoming
car
and
when
the
blood
and
snow
were
cleared
a
girl
in
the
other
vehicle
was
dead
the
result
was
sarah
decided
she
taken
a
human
life
her
own
minor
facial
cuts
which
lou
immediately
had
repaired
with
plastic
surgery
somehow
evolved
into
a
major
disfigurement
of
her
soul
all
her
mental
eccentricities
which
had
been
locked
up
somewhere
when
she
started
college
came
back
like
a
rush
of
demons
loosed
from
some
pandora
box
deep
in
her
psyche
she
dropped
out
of
school
and
before
long
she
was
in
the
throes
of
a
mental
meltdown
she
disappeared
and
in
the
following
two
years
lou
got
exactly
one
card
from
her
postmarked
in
san
francisco
with
no
return
address
he
carried
it
with
him
at
all
times
and
we
both
studied
it
often
puzzling
over
the
new
age
astrological
symbol
on
the
front
the
brief
note
announced
she
acquired
divine
energy
and
was
living
on
a
new
plane
of
consciousness
then
eight
months
ago
the
state
department
notified
lou
she
was
missing
in
guatemala
she
overstayed
her
visa
and
nobody
knew
where
she
was
so
how
did
her
new
plane
of
consciousness
land
her
in
central
america
was
that
part
of
the
fantasy
world
she
now
returned
to
lou
still
worked
downtown
at
federal
plaza
but
he
immediately
took
a
leave
of
absence
and
though
he
spoke
not
a
syllable
of
spanish
plunged
down
there
to
look
for
her
he
was
there
a
month
following
false
leads
till
he
finally
ran
into
a
reverend
ben
jackson
late
of
a
protestant
ministry
in
mississippi
who
was
one
of
the
ardent
new
evangelicals
swarming
over
central
america
the
man
mentioned
that
some
chicle
harvesters
in
the
northwest
peten
department
of
guatemala
had
found
a
young
woman
in
an
old
dugout
canoe
on
the
guatemala
side
of
the
wide
usumacinta
river
near
a
tributary
called
the
rio
tigre
lodged
in
amongst
overhanging
trees
she
been
struck
on
the
head
and
presumably
set
adrift
somewhere
upriver
left
for
dead
she
was
now
in
a
coma
resting
at
jackson
jesus
es
el
hombre
clinic
also
located
deep
in
the
northwest
peten
rain
forest
he
had
no
idea
who
she
was
lou
rented
a
car
and
drove
there
almost
a
day
on
unpaved
roads
it
was
sarah
thus
she
was
no
longer
missing
she
was
now
the
apparent
victim
of
an
attempted
murder
however
rather
than
being
helpful
the
local
appeared
annoyed
she
been
found
thereby
reopening
the
matter
a
blond
out
hiking
somewhere
she
had
no
business
being
in
the
first
place
and
tripped
and
hit
her
head
on
something
where
the
crime
lou
brought
her
back
to
new
york
using
a
medevac
plane
supplied
by
the
state
department
which
wanting
no
more
scandals
of
american
nationals
being
murdered
in
guatemala
cooperated
with
great
dispatch
after
that
he
needed
a
job
that
would
afford
him
time
flexibility
so
he
could
be
at
her
bedside
as
much
as
possible
david
was
looking
for
a
security
head
and
i
realized
it
would
be
a
perfect
match
since
we
did
really
need
a
person
lou
could
spend
a
lot
of
hours
at
lenox
hill
watching
over
sarah
she
was
just
lying
there
now
no
sign
of
consciousness
her
body
being
kept
alive
with
iv
i
go
by
to
visit
her
as
much
as
i
could
and
almost
as
bad
as
seeing
the
comatose
sarah
was
seeing
the
grief
in
lou
eyes
he
would
sit
there
at
the
hospital
every
day
sometimes
several
hours
a
day
fingering
an
old
engraved
locket
that
carried
her
graduation
picture
just
rubbing
it
through
his
fingers
like
a
rosary
we
always
made
allowances
when
he
wanted
to
take
time
off
during
one
of
our
shooting
schedules
figuring
maybe
he
was
helping
her
as
i
turned
east
to
go
crosstown
i
thought
again
about
condition
she
and
i
looked
a
lot
alike
dense
blond
hair
for
one
thing
but
to
see
her
now
you
scarcely
know
it
since
hers
had
been
clipped
down
to
nothing
by
the
hospital
her
cheekbones
however
were
still
strong
a
quality
now
exaggerated
by
her
emaciated
state
and
her
eyes
which
i
had
not
seen
in
years
were
a
deep
languid
turquoise
blue
but
seeing
her
lying
there
inert
being
kept
alive
with
tubes
and
liquids
wearing
pressure
pants
to
help
circulate
blood
through
her
legs
you
scarcely
realize
she
been
a
strikingly
beautiful
woman
before
the
accident
what
worse
from
what
i
knew
the
horrific
brain
traumas
that
bring
on
a
coma
do
automatically
go
away
when
you
regain
consciousness
if
the
coma
is
the
result
of
a
head
injury
and
if
it
lasts
more
than
a
few
days
the
chances
of
regaining
all
your
mental
functions
are
up
for
grabs
lou
once
said
there
a
scale
of
eight
stages
to
full
recovery
people
who
have
short
comas
can
sometimes
come
out
of
them
and
go
through
those
stages
quickly
from
initial
eye
movement
to
full
mental
faculties
others
who
been
under
for
months
or
longer
can
require
years
to
come
back
sometimes
they
can
only
blink
their
eyes
to
answer
questions
sometimes
they
babble
on
incessantly
they
can
talk
sense
or
they
can
talk
nonsense
incoherent
fantasies
even
strings
of
numbers
the
brain
is
a
complex
unpredictable
thing
i
always
thought
about
this
as
i
took
the
elevator
up
to
lenox
third
floor
the
room
where
they
kept
sarah
was
painted
a
pale
sterile
blue
and
made
even
more
depressing
by
stark
fluorescent
lights
everything
was
chrome
and
enamel
including
the
instruments
whose
crt
screens
reported
her
bodily
functions
none
of
the
instruments
however
had
ever
shown
the
brain
activity
associated
with
consciousness
lou
was
there
when
i
walked
in
he
had
a
kind
of
wildness
in
his
eyes
maybe
what
you
get
when
you
mix
hope
with
despair
we
hugged
each
other
and
he
said
she
had
a
moment
morgy
she
knew
me
i
sure
she
did
then
he
told
me
in
detail
what
had
happened
a
nurse
passing
room
had
happened
to
notice
an
unexpected
flickering
on
one
of
her
monitors
she
immediately
informed
the
nurses
station
where
instructions
included
lou
home
number
he
grabbed
a
cab
and
raced
there
when
he
got
to
her
room
he
pushed
his
way
past
the
caribbean
nurses
and
bent
over
her
the
first
time
he
had
hoped
a
conversation
with
her
would
be
anything
but
a
monologue
honey
can
you
hear
me
there
was
no
sign
save
the
faint
flicker
of
an
eyelid
it
was
enough
his
own
pulse
rocketed
where
the
damned
doctor
while
the
physician
was
being
summoned
he
had
a
chance
to
study
her
yes
there
definitely
was
some
movement
behind
her
eyelids
and
her
regular
breathing
had
become
less
measured
as
though
she
were
fighting
to
overcome
her
autonomic
nervous
system
and
challenge
life
on
her
own
finally
an
overworked
pakistani
intern
arrived
he
proceeded
to
fiddle
with
the
monitors
doing
something
lou
did
not
understand
then
without
warning
and
certainly
attributable
to
nothing
the
physician
did
sarah
opened
her
eyes
lou
who
had
not
seen
those
eyes
for
several
years
caught
himself
feasting
on
their
rich
aquatic
blue
he
looked
into
them
but
they
did
not
look
back
they
were
focused
on
infinity
adrift
in
a
lost
sea
of
their
own
making
they
stared
at
him
a
moment
then
vanished
again
behind
her
eyelids
he
told
me
all
this
and
then
his
voice
trailed
off
his
despair
returning
lou
it
a
start
whatever
happens
is
bound
to
be
slow
but
this
could
be
the
beginning
we
both
knew
what
i
was
saying
was
perilously
close
to
wishful
thinking
but
nobody
in
the
room
was
under
oath
for
the
moment
though
she
was
back
in
her
coma
as
though
nothing
had
changed
i
waited
around
until
eight
when
i
finally
convinced
myself
that
being
there
was
not
doing
anybody
any
good
lou
i
later
learned
stayed
on
till
well
past
eleven
when
they
finally
had
to
send
security
to
evict
him
okay
i
been
holding
out
on
the
most
important
detail
the
truth
is
i
hardly
knew
what
to
make
of
it
at
one
point
when
i
was
bending
over
sarah
seemingly
unconscious
face
her
eyes
had
clicked
open
for
just
a
fleeting
moment
startling
me
the
way
those
horror
movies
do
when
the
suddenly
come
alive
lou
was
in
his
chair
and
did
see
it
did
notice
me
jump
the
last
thing
i
wanted
to
do
was
tell
him
about
it
and
i
was
still
shivering
as
i
shoved
my
key
into
the
toyota
ignition
and
headed
for
home
she
looked
directly
into
my
eyes
a
flicker
of
recognition
and
then
came
the
fear
she
sort
of
moved
her
mouth
trying
to
speak
but
all
that
came
was
a
silent
scream
after
which
her
eyes
went
blank
as
death
and
closed
again
she
knew
me
i
was
sure
of
it
but
she
had
looked
through
me
and
seen
a
reminder
of
some
horror
now
locked
deep
in
her
soul
chapter
four
lou
took
the
next
few
days
off
to
spend
by
sarah
side
but
nothing
more
happened
i
repeatedly
called
him
at
the
hospital
to
check
on
her
though
it
was
becoming
clear
her
brush
with
consciousness
had
only
been
an
interlude
finally
i
decided
to
show
carly
rushes
to
david
he
loved
them
and
try
to
concentrate
on
postproduction
for
the
rest
of
the
week
and
the
weekend
anything
to
make
me
not
have
to
dwell
on
sarah
ghostlike
soundless
cry
of
anguish
postproduction
when
you
shooting
a
picture
you
have
to
make
all
kinds
of
compromises
but
in
post
with
luck
and
skill
you
can
transform
that
raw
footage
into
art
you
mix
and
cut
the
takes
till
the
performances
are
taut
you
loop
in
rerecorded
dialogue
where
necessary
to
get
just
the
right
reading
of
a
line
the
foley
guys
give
you
clear
sound
effects
where
the
production
sound
is
muddy
and
you
balance
the
hues
of
reds
and
blues
darks
and
lights
till
you
get
just
the
right
color
tone
all
of
the
polishing
that
came
with
post
still
lay
ahead
the
first
step
was
to
go
through
the
rough
cut
and
spot
the
film
marking
places
where
the
sound
effects
or
dialogue
would
need
to
be
replaced
with
rerecorded
studio
sound
which
meant
several
days
maybe
weeks
of
looping
to
edit
out
background
noise
and
make
the
dialogue
sound
rich
and
crisp
for
some
of
it
the
actors
would
have
to
come
back
in
and
themselves
which
they
always
hate
it
was
daunting
to
have
to
work
back
and
forth
between
production
sound
tracks
and
loop
tracks
blending
alternate
takes
you
had
to
figure
on
only
doing
about
ten
minutes
of
film
a
day
and
then
after
all
that
you
had
to
get
the
opticals
right
the
and
dissolves
and
finally
the
credit
sequences
normally
once
i
started
post
i
would
have
exactly
ten
weeks
to
accomplish
all
that
before
the
executive
producer
david
got
his
hands
on
my
picture
that
was
the
prerogative
that
was
part
of
the
standard
director
contract
now
though
i
figured
that
was
out
the
window
with
the
money
going
fast
i
had
to
produce
a
rough
cut
and
get
the
picture
sold
to
cable
in
six
weeks
period
but
first
things
first
i
deeply
needed
at
least
one
more
interview
carly
was
too
much
of
a
happy
which
was
why
i
needed
to
shoot
paula
marks
it
was
now
on
for
thursday
today
the
appointment
had
taken
all
weekend
including
a
sunday
brunch
to
set
up
but
by
that
time
i
was
sure
this
second
mother
would
be
perfect
she
was
a
tall
willowy
woman
who
had
let
her
hair
start
going
to
gray
honesty
it
was
right
there
in
her
pale
brown
eyes
she
wrote
children
books
had
never
married
she
now
believed
she
never
would
and
had
decided
to
adopt
a
child
because
she
had
a
lot
of
extra
love
she
felt
was
going
to
waste
different
from
carly
grove
maybe
but
not
in
the
matter
of
strength
and
fearless
independence
we
arrived
around
ten
to
discover
her
apartment
was
in
one
of
those
sprawling
prewar
west
side
monoliths
thick
plaster
walls
and
a
rabbit
warren
of
halls
and
foyers
legacy
of
an
age
before
lofts
and
open
spaces
terribly
cramped
for
shooting
but
paula
agreed
to
let
the
crew
move
her
old
overstuffed
couch
out
of
the
living
room
along
with
the
piles
of
books
that
lined
the
walls
another
issue
was
makeup
at
first
paula
insisted
she
did
want
any
never
wore
it
it
was
deceitful
and
she
did
want
to
appear
on
camera
looking
like
barbie
small
chance
of
that
i
thought
a
little
war
paint
now
and
then
might
help
your
chances
of
landing
a
father
for
this
child
eventually
arlene
persuaded
her
that
cameras
lie
and
the
only
way
to
look
like
yourself
is
to
enhance
those
qualities
that
make
you
you
it
was
a
thin
argument
but
arlene
came
from
a
long
line
of
apparel
proprietors
who
could
unload
sunlamps
in
the
sahara
paula
adopted
daughter
rachel
who
was
a
year
and
a
half
old
was
running
around
the
apartment
blond
tresses
flowing
dragging
a
doll
she
had
named
angie
except
the
name
came
out
she
was
immediately
adopted
by
the
crew
and
erica
the
production
manager
was
soon
teaching
her
how
to
play
then
rachel
wanted
to
demonstrate
her
new
skills
at
eating
spaghetti
in
five
minutes
she
was
covered
head
to
toe
in
ragu
tomato
sauce
when
the
panaflex
was
finally
rolling
the
story
paula
spun
out
was
almost
identical
to
the
one
told
by
carly
grove
she
spent
hours
with
all
the
legal
services
recommended
by
nysac
new
york
singles
adopting
children
listening
to
them
describe
a
scenario
of
delays
and
paperwork
and
heartache
it
could
be
done
but
it
could
take
years
look
declared
i
cash
in
my
ira
do
anything
just
give
me
some
hope
okay
they
replied
tighten
your
belt
scare
up
sixty
big
ones
and
go
to
see
children
of
light
we
hear
stories
soon
after
she
called
them
the
skies
had
opened
a
new
age
physician
and
teacher
there
a
man
with
striking
eyes
named
alex
goddard
had
made
it
happen
rachel
was
hers
in
just
four
months
no
paperwork
sure
she
declared
children
of
light
was
expensive
but
alex
goddard
was
a
deeply
spiritual
man
who
really
took
the
time
to
get
to
know
you
even
practically
begged
you
to
come
to
his
and
go
through
his
course
of
fertility
treatment
but
when
she
insisted
she
just
wanted
to
adopt
he
obligingly
found
rachel
for
her
how
could
she
be
anything
but
grateful
she
was
so
happy
she
wanted
everybody
in
the
world
to
know
about
him
as
she
bubbled
on
i
found
my
attention
wandering
to
rachel
who
just
escaped
from
the
crew
keeping
her
in
the
kitchen
and
was
running
through
the
living
room
singing
a
song
from
sesame
street
something
about
the
way
she
moved
was
very
evocative
where
i
seen
her
before
then
it
dawned
on
me
her
walk
made
me
think
of
kevin
actually
everything
about
her
reminded
me
of
kevin
were
all
kids
starting
to
look
the
same
god
i
wanted
them
both
yeah
i
thought
daydreaming
of
holding
her
she
kevin
all
over
again
clear
as
day
she
a
dead
ringer
to
be
his
older
sister
it
feels
very
strange
or
maybe
i
was
just
seeing
things
to
some
extent
all
babies
looked
alike
right
that
is
until
you
have
one
of
your
own
i
had
to
swallow
hard
to
try
to
collect
my
thoughts
carly
and
paula
scarcely
even
knew
each
other
if
rachel
really
was
kevin
sister
they
never
know
anything
about
it
incredible
it
was
just
too
big
a
coincidence
but
still
and
what
about
the
film
footage
show
of
the
kids
and
anybody
not
legally
blind
was
going
to
see
the
similarity
why
would
somebody
give
up
two
children
for
adoption
i
found
myself
wondering
giving
up
one
was
tragic
enough
cut
i
waved
at
everybody
take
ten
we
need
to
recharge
here
take
a
break
and
stretch
paula
was
caught
off
guard
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
and
she
let
her
voice
trail
off
puzzled
hey
i
sorry
rachel
came
barging
in
paula
finally
said
guess
she
broke
everybody
concentration
huh
yeah
well
sometimes
we
all
need
to
lean
back
and
take
a
fresh
run
at
things
i
called
to
rachel
who
came
trotting
over
spaghetti
sauce
still
on
her
face
and
picked
her
up
i
felt
at
a
loss
about
what
to
do
tell
paula
her
daughter
had
a
younger
brother
in
the
village
and
she
might
fall
apart
i
was
actually
curious
about
something
do
you
know
anything
about
rachel
birth
mother
i
do
want
to
know
it
would
disrupt
my
life
and
my
peace
of
mind
her
eyes
acquired
a
kind
of
sadness
mingled
with
anxiety
reconciled
to
the
fact
she
probably
got
into
some
kind
of
trouble
may
not
have
exactly
been
nobel
prize
material
but
i
a
big
believer
in
nurture
over
nature
that
why
i
write
books
for
kids
so
i
think
rachel
going
to
end
up
being
a
lot
more
like
me
than
like
her
real
mother
brave
words
but
i
bet
you
anything
the
story
of
rachel
mother
is
a
lot
more
complicated
than
you
imagine
i
glanced
at
my
watch
the
hour
pushing
time
to
call
it
a
wrap
besides
if
we
shot
any
more
today
the
crew
would
end
up
on
overtime
and
david
was
getting
increasingly
nervous
about
my
extra
costs
i
also
needed
a
little
downtime
to
reflect
look
i
think
i
got
enough
footage
to
work
with
for
now
let
me
just
get
the
release
signed
take
this
film
downtown
and
get
it
processed
maybe
we
can
come
back
for
another
shoot
when
i
figure
out
exactly
where
this
is
going
anytime
just
give
me
some
notice
and
i
try
to
have
the
place
cleaned
up
more
next
time
do
worry
i
like
it
to
look
real
just
sign
the
release
and
take
it
from
there
i
was
about
to
set
rachel
back
on
the
floor
when
something
caught
in
my
sweater
looking
down
i
realized
it
was
a
tiny
charm
bracelet
with
two
little
medallions
on
it
one
was
a
little
red
plastic
likeness
of
pocahontas
the
disney
character
and
the
other
was
a
silver
face
of
a
cat
long
and
stylized
and
on
the
back
those
curious
lines
and
dots
again
only
these
were
arranged
differently
from
those
on
the
one
carly
boy
kevin
had
paula
what
this
this
cat
where
you
get
it
oh
that
she
smiled
she
was
wearing
it
when
i
got
her
on
a
little
silk
cord
around
her
waist
under
her
diaper
they
told
me
it
was
a
gift
from
her
real
mother
a
keepsake
sort
of
breaks
your
heart
but
the
way
they
said
it
you
want
to
keep
it
forever
at
that
moment
erica
was
just
plugging
the
phone
back
in
and
the
second
she
did
the
old
black
panasonic
cordless
began
to
ring
hang
on
a
sec
paula
said
let
me
get
that
my
agent
is
supposed
she
picked
up
the
phone
and
was
plopping
back
onto
the
couch
hi
then
her
look
turned
blank
no
of
course
not
she
fell
into
an
uncomfortable
pause
looking
around
at
everybody
then
she
continued
nobody
contacted
me
she
halted
again
her
face
white
and
stared
directly
at
me
i
abruptly
sensed
that
i
was
the
topic
of
the
conversation
sure
i
sure
yes
i
remember
signing
do
worry
i
have
no
reason
to
okay
sure
i
let
you
know
she
clicked
off
the
phone
and
looked
up
with
startled
eyes
it
was
somebody
who
said
they
worked
for
children
of
light
she
wanted
to
know
if
you
contacted
me
her
face
collapsed
you
she
asked
me
specifically
about
by
name
how
did
i
have
no
idea
my
hands
were
growing
cold
had
carly
told
them
about
me
why
would
she
do
that
anyway
you
handled
it
okay
which
made
me
wonder
if
children
of
light
was
such
a
perfect
organization
why
was
paula
so
frightened
she
immediately
felt
compelled
to
lie
to
swear
she
had
broken
their
rules
right
her
composure
was
slowly
coming
back
look
now
that
i
think
about
it
why
should
they
care
it
does
make
any
sense
they
got
their
money
she
turned
to
me
let
me
have
that
release
she
seized
the
paper
and
endorsed
it
with
a
flourish
my
pulse
was
still
in
overdrive
but
i
hugged
her
then
signaled
the
crew
that
shooting
was
over
for
the
day
okay
everybody
time
to
wrap
the
gang
immediately
began
striking
the
lights
and
rolling
up
electrical
cords
they
would
take
the
equipment
back
downtown
and
deliver
the
film
to
the
lab
while
i
would
head
home
it
had
been
a
long
day
and
lots
of
thinking
was
needed
besides
it
was
starting
to
rain
a
dismal
spatter
against
paula
grimy
windows
as
the
gray
spring
afternoon
had
begun
darkening
toward
sullen
evening
listen
i
enjoyed
this
paula
had
taken
rachel
in
her
arms
and
was
stroking
her
blond
hair
i
really
love
talking
about
her
changed
my
life
i
gave
her
another
hug
you
great
and
you
going
to
be
wonderful
in
the
film
if
i
used
her
the
whole
thing
was
getting
unnerving
you
have
no
idea
how
much
you
helped
then
i
said
to
rachel
who
responded
with
a
perfect
bye
bye
through
her
haze
of
spaghetti
sauce
okay
get
the
superintendent
crank
up
the
freight
elevator
get
out
of
here
scott
ventri
key
grip
took
charge
of
handling
the
gear
dictating
which
equipment
got
loaded
on
first
i
watched
long
enough
to
make
sure
everything
was
going
okay
and
then
i
joined
arlene
old
friend
and
queen
of
outrageous
makeup
on
the
other
elevator
you
notice
it
she
whispered
the
door
had
just
closed
notice
what
i
knew
full
well
what
she
was
talking
about
but
it
just
felt
too
bizarre
those
kids
could
almost
be
twins
that
little
boy
last
week
and
this
girl
they
look
just
alike
it
spooky
guess
their
parents
could
figure
out
what
was
causing
those
pregnancies
so
they
just
kept
having
more
babies
i
decided
to
try
to
insert
some
humor
deflect
the
conversation
maybe
we
should
tell
paula
and
carly
very
dumb
arlene
bit
at
a
long
red
false
fingernail
a
perennial
habit
for
as
long
as
i
known
her
we
should
mind
our
own
business
that
what
we
should
do
works
for
me
but
it
also
proves
we
were
smart
not
to
shoot
any
footage
of
the
kids
the
whole
world
would
realize
something
funny
then
i
had
an
idea
want
to
come
downtown
to
my
place
after
we
unload
have
some
deep
thoughts
over
what
all
this
means
first
the
kids
then
the
call
what
was
this
guy
alex
goddard
whoever
he
was
up
to
definitely
time
to
talk
to
somebody
gee
i
love
to
arlene
was
saying
but
i
ca
i
got
ta
go
out
to
kew
gardens
for
my
mom
and
dad
anniversary
tonight
their
can
you
believe
of
course
i
was
a
very
late
baby
she
blinked
her
dark
languid
eyes
as
though
rehearsing
the
line
for
a
downtown
club
a
miracle
of
modern
fertility
science
right
shit
arlene
i
need
you
right
she
giggled
then
seemed
to
study
the
flashing
lights
on
the
elevator
control
panel
god
those
kids
they
too
good
to
be
true
i
love
to
have
one
like
that
she
impatiently
pounded
the
number
one
a
couple
of
times
perhaps
hoping
to
speed
our
creaky
descent
i
can
get
bonked
every
night
of
the
week
but
i
ca
get
a
serious
boyfriend
new
york
clubs
are
exactly
brimming
with
the
type
and
as
for
the
pickings
at
work
given
the
kind
of
pictures
david
makes
forget
it
last
thing
i
need
is
some
pothead
who
thinks
with
his
wang
i
afraid
i
not
helping
you
much
with
this
one
i
cast
mostly
with
unknowns
the
actress
mary
gregg
was
a
veteran
of
joseph
papp
original
public
theater
the
experimental
enterprise
downtown
the
few
male
parts
all
went
to
guys
who
were
either
gay
or
married
oy
what
can
you
do
right
if
it
happens
it
happens
arlene
watched
the
door
begin
to
stutter
open
as
we
bumped
onto
the
lobby
level
then
she
zeroed
in
on
me
you
really
want
a
kid
too
do
you
i
mean
that
why
you
did
this
script
right
which
by
the
way
is
great
i
mean
the
script
i
think
most
women
do
down
deep
she
smiled
well
if
i
ever
have
one
it
going
to
be
the
way
it
a
heck
of
a
lot
cheaper
than
adopting
she
was
heading
out
into
the
front
foyer
not
to
mention
more
fun
getting
there
on
that
i
definitely
had
to
agree
the
lobby
prewar
look
was
gray
and
dismal
and
as
we
emerged
onto
the
street
the
rain
had
turned
into
a
steady
downpour
lou
was
off
again
today
down
at
the
hospital
with
sarah
so
i
engaged
a
doorman
from
a
new
across
the
street
to
keep
an
eye
on
our
vans
a
crisp
twenty
had
extracted
his
solemn
promise
to
do
just
that
at
the
moment
however
he
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
proving
i
suppose
david
theory
that
we
needed
our
own
security
guy
at
all
location
shoots
lou
i
thought
i
hope
you
finally
getting
through
to
her
no
limo
but
at
least
we
get
first
call
on
the
vans
arlene
observed
her
voice
not
hiding
the
sarcasm
just
once
like
to
work
for
somebody
who
had
serious
vip
transportation
david
would
walk
before
he
get
a
limo
we
were
headed
down
the
street
me
digging
out
my
keys
when
i
noticed
the
man
standing
in
the
rain
he
was
just
behind
our
lead
van
a
gray
ford
waiting
for
us
my
first
thought
was
he
must
be
connected
to
nicky
russo
wiseguy
banker
here
to
bust
my
chops
over
the
teamster
issue
screw
him
just
my
luck
he
send
somebody
the
very
day
lou
was
not
on
hand
but
then
i
realized
i
guessed
wrong
the
man
was
more
hispanic
than
italian
he
also
was
short
solidly
built
late
fifties
maybe
with
intense
eyes
and
gray
hair
that
circled
his
balding
pate
like
the
dirty
snow
around
a
volcano
rim
as
he
moved
toward
us
i
thought
i
detected
something
military
in
his
bearing
not
so
much
the
crispness
of
a
soldier
but
rather
the
authoritative
swagger
of
an
officer
well
maybe
a
retired
officer
the
paper
on
your
windshield
says
you
are
filming
a
movie
came
a
voice
with
a
definite
spanish
accent
no
greetings
no
hiya
how
you
doin
just
the
blunt
statement
then
having
established
what
was
already
clear
to
all
at
hand
he
continued
it
says
the
title
is
why
are
you
making
this
movie
here
that
was
it
i
glanced
at
arlene
who
turned
white
as
a
sheet
you
get
a
lot
of
onlookers
around
a
location
shoot
but
not
too
many
who
challenge
your
right
to
exist
which
was
exactly
what
was
coming
through
in
his
menacing
tone
i
handed
arlene
the
keys
here
go
ahead
and
open
up
i
handle
this
then
i
turned
back
to
him
what
you
saw
in
the
windshield
of
the
vans
is
a
new
york
city
film
board
permit
that
all
the
information
we
are
required
to
provide
if
you
read
it
you
know
everything
i
obliged
to
tell
you
i
returned
his
stare
however
if
people
ask
nicely
happy
to
answer
their
questions
are
you
making
this
movie
about
a
person
in
this
building
your
other
films
have
been
documentaries
god
help
me
i
thought
is
this
what
my
fans
are
like
then
it
hit
me
i
do
know
how
i
missed
the
connection
but
now
it
just
leapt
out
first
the
phone
call
then
this
hood
somebody
was
tracking
me
i
scouting
locations
i
lied
feeling
a
chill
go
through
me
second
unit
for
an
action
film
shooting
some
prep
footage
for
the
producers
does
the
name
arnold
schwarzenegger
mean
anything
to
you
then
why
is
the
film
about
babies
that
meant
to
be
a
joke
remember
the
movie
it
a
joke
title
do
you
understand
at
that
moment
paul
nulty
came
barging
out
the
door
with
a
huge
klieg
light
followed
by
several
other
members
of
the
crew
carrying
sound
gear
our
cordial
was
about
to
be
disrupted
my
new
hispanic
friend
saw
them
and
abruptly
drew
up
that
was
when
i
noticed
the
shoulder
holster
under
his
jacket
containing
some
sort
of
pistol
jesus
i
thought
this
must
be
what
some
kind
of
hired
killer
looks
like
that
gun
not
a
prop
i
think
you
are
lying
he
closed
his
jacket
and
ignoring
my
crew
bored
in
relentlessly
on
me
his
eyes
dead
and
merciless
that
is
a
big
mistake
it
was
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
ever
stood
next
to
a
man
who
had
a
gun
and
was
deeply
ticked
at
me
he
wanted
me
to
see
his
piece
just
to
make
sure
i
took
him
seriously
he
was
threatening
me
per
se
rather
he
was
letting
me
know
how
strongly
he
cared
about
what
i
was
doing
well
damn
him
but
i
still
was
scared
i
might
have
managed
to
bluff
nicky
russo
but
he
was
a
guy
who
operated
by
an
set
of
sicilian
rules
this
thug
did
strike
me
as
the
type
hand
shaking
i
pulled
out
my
cell
phone
flicked
it
open
and
punched
in
listen
if
you
threatening
me
with
a
gun
i
calling
the
cops
whatever
problem
you
have
with
the
new
york
film
industry
you
can
explain
it
to
them
new
york
police
emergency
number
was
still
ringing
as
he
abruptly
turned
and
strode
away
i
clicked
the
phone
shut
and
moved
to
get
out
of
the
way
as
a
trolley
loaded
with
more
gear
was
rolled
past
me
down
the
sidewalk
unfortunately
i
also
took
my
eyes
off
him
for
a
second
and
when
i
looked
up
again
he
seemed
to
have
disappeared
into
the
rain
though
i
did
notice
somebody
who
could
have
been
him
get
into
a
long
black
car
well
down
the
block
and
speed
off
toward
broadway
what
did
that
creep
want
arlene
asked
coming
back
with
the
keys
i
was
only
slowly
returning
to
reality
and
it
took
me
a
few
moments
to
form
a
coherent
answer
through
all
the
adrenaline
surging
into
my
brain
i
i
do
know
but
i
think
i
better
warn
everybody
to
keep
an
eye
out
for
strangers
he
he
wound
a
little
tight
to
put
it
mildly
i
was
still
shaking
which
she
fortunately
failed
to
notice
at
that
point
there
seemed
no
great
reason
to
spook
her
with
mention
of
the
gun
boy
he
was
just
some
homeless
junkie
she
said
he
looked
like
a
heavy
in
one
of
david
old
action
pictures
all
he
needed
was
a
right
jesus
arlene
i
think
he
might
have
had
one
so
let
get
moving
as
i
watched
the
vans
being
loaded
slowly
calming
down
i
kept
thinking
about
him
he
was
undoubtedly
connected
to
the
phone
call
but
why
would
anybody
be
so
worried
about
what
i
was
doing
i
think
of
any
serious
reason
half
an
hour
later
we
were
all
headed
downtown
along
the
streets
the
all
beef
vendors
cowered
under
their
striped
umbrellas
while
departing
office
workers
briefcases
perched
above
their
heads
as
makeshift
protection
scurried
along
the
edges
of
buildings
searching
for
cabs
while
arlene
continued
to
chat
nonstop
i
tried
to
do
a
little
mental
processing
and
my
mind
kept
drifting
back
to
the
sight
of
little
rachel
and
kevin
what
perfect
kids
the
way
she
was
running
hey
wait
a
minute
how
could
they
be
siblings
brother
and
sister
rachel
was
almost
exactly
half
a
year
older
than
kevin
biology
work
that
way
no
way
could
they
be
related
but
still
they
looked
so
alike
i
realized
arlene
had
put
it
together
about
the
ages
the
theory
made
absolutely
no
sense
those
kids
were
born
six
months
apart
if
that
was
strange
enough
why
did
they
both
have
those
tiny
cat
medallions
with
the
lines
and
dots
on
the
back
which
were
actually
kind
of
creepy
more
like
sacred
amulets
than
little
toys
talk
to
lou
he
might
have
some
insights
no
better
yet
go
to
the
source
children
of
light
call
alex
goddard
adoption
agency
or
clinic
or
whatever
it
is
and
make
an
appointment
chapter
five
i
was
feeling
a
bit
off
center
that
evening
but
i
explained
it
away
as
mental
overload
the
rain
and
the
implied
threats
that
diagnosis
got
revised
the
next
morning
when
i
awoke
with
a
headache
chills
alternating
with
a
mild
fever
and
my
chest
feeling
like
it
was
caught
in
a
compactor
it
was
a
common
cold
but
there
was
nothing
common
about
my
misery
which
was
truly
exceptional
i
made
a
cup
of
echinacea
tea
and
then
washed
down
mg
of
vitamin
c
with
some
aging
orange
juice
from
my
fridge
after
which
i
took
a
couple
of
tylenol
put
on
yesterday
jeans
and
headed
uptown
to
work
i
also
treated
myself
to
a
cab
when
i
settled
into
the
cluttered
corner
room
that
was
my
office
i
told
myself
this
was
not
a
day
to
make
any
big
decisions
just
stick
to
matters
that
required
nothing
more
than
autopilot
the
first
thing
i
did
was
call
lou
to
check
on
sarah
no
change
and
then
i
told
him
about
my
hispanic
visitor
he
made
concerned
sounds
and
promised
to
accompany
me
on
any
further
location
shoots
next
i
pulled
out
my
date
book
and
punched
in
a
phone
number
scribbled
in
the
back
i
gotten
it
when
i
was
winding
up
my
interview
with
carly
grove
children
of
light
said
an
unctuous
voice
this
is
ramala
i
hesitated
a
moment
before
giving
my
name
they
already
knew
who
i
was
ramala
or
somebody
had
called
paula
marks
and
asked
about
me
me
what
would
she
do
when
she
heard
it
was
yours
truly
in
the
flesh
i
tried
to
take
a
deep
breath
working
around
the
feeling
my
lungs
were
on
fire
and
identified
myself
ramala
received
the
information
as
though
she
never
heard
of
me
maybe
she
had
then
i
asked
for
an
appointment
with
alex
goddard
as
soon
as
it
was
convenient
he
leaves
his
saturdays
open
she
said
more
of
the
smiley
voice
so
i
could
make
a
special
appointment
for
you
tomorrow
would
ten
be
all
right
her
accent
was
the
kind
of
delhi
you
associate
with
expensive
silk
saris
and
ruby
bracelets
yet
at
the
same
time
her
voice
had
an
overlay
of
that
melodious
unctuousness
you
hear
on
relaxation
tapes
i
half
expected
her
to
next
say
inhale
deeply
and
feel
the
love
flowing
through
the
universe
in
any
case
she
could
have
sounded
more
open
and
forthcoming
i
had
to
remind
myself
immediately
that
it
was
true
given
the
inquisitive
phone
call
to
paula
marks
children
of
light
was
an
organization
that
deeply
cherished
its
privacy
presumably
they
had
a
reason
and
that
reason
did
necessarily
have
to
be
sinister
but
still
i
had
every
reason
to
think
they
were
upset
about
me
and
it
made
me
paranoid
and
now
alex
goddard
immediately
had
time
for
a
special
appointment
ten
will
be
fine
i
said
just
barely
croaking
the
words
out
of
my
chest
she
gave
me
directions
for
reaching
the
riverdale
clinic
called
quetzal
manor
and
hung
up
i
felt
so
miserable
i
could
barely
remember
afterward
what
she
said
but
fortunately
i
taken
notes
quetzal
manor
an
odd
choice
for
a
name
i
thought
some
kind
of
bird
sacred
to
the
maya
indians
of
central
america
but
then
paula
had
mentioned
at
one
point
that
he
was
very
interested
in
indigenous
third
world
herbs
and
remedies
so
maybe
it
fit
but
still
one
big
puzzle
kept
coming
back
to
haunt
how
do
you
produce
perfectly
healthy
siblings
six
months
apart
i
actually
called
carly
and
paula
back
to
verify
the
ages
the
more
i
thought
about
kevin
and
rachel
the
more
i
realized
they
were
so
unmistakably
related
puzzling
over
that
i
began
to
wonder
if
maybe
i
was
on
the
verge
of
uncovering
a
blockbuster
documentary
could
we
be
talking
something
approaching
science
fiction
here
making
documentaries
you
always
on
the
lookout
for
the
unexpected
the
fresh
so
how
about
an
organization
that
could
obtain
beautiful
caucasian
babies
seemingly
at
will
including
born
a
few
months
apart
i
was
already
framing
a
pitch
to
david
in
my
mind
anyway
the
rest
of
the
day
while
i
was
busy
battling
my
cold
with
antihistamines
and
lots
of
hot
soup
i
mounted
a
major
phone
inquiry
just
to
make
sure
all
the
rules
on
adoption
had
somehow
changed
when
i
was
looking
they
had
first
off
to
get
a
child
in
three
or
four
months
you
almost
certainly
have
to
go
with
foreign
adoption
china
was
everybody
flavor
of
the
month
because
they
favored
older
parents
and
also
because
the
policy
there
had
ended
up
producing
a
abandonment
of
girls
who
were
all
those
precious
boys
going
to
marry
i
often
found
myself
wondering
however
the
shifting
politics
there
made
the
process
very
unreliable
a
few
months
do
even
think
about
it
pressing
on
i
satisfied
myself
that
the
organizations
that
found
babies
in
the
emerging
parts
of
the
world
all
still
worked
the
same
cradle
of
hope
specialized
in
orphaned
russian
kids
children
and
families
provided
adoptions
for
equadorian
children
international
adoption
assistance
handled
brazilian
orphans
but
they
all
were
still
fussy
and
they
could
take
ages
how
about
a
healthy
baby
in
just
a
few
months
i
ask
some
kind
of
new
fast
track
the
question
was
always
taken
as
a
joke
i
would
be
driving
up
to
quetzal
manor
in
my
old
toyota
and
i
dearly
wished
steve
could
somehow
materialize
and
be
with
me
in
his
absence
however
i
convinced
lou
to
come
along
i
figured
the
change
of
scene
would
do
him
good
and
i
also
wanted
the
security
of
having
him
with
me
after
the
threatening
phone
call
to
paula
and
the
hispanic
thug
who
accosted
me
outside
her
apartment
building
besides
it
just
be
a
couple
of
hours
the
next
morning
as
we
trekked
up
riverside
drive
then
the
henry
hudson
parkway
the
sky
was
a
flawless
blue
and
the
wide
hudson
seemed
like
an
ardent
highway
leading
into
the
heart
of
america
still
in
elevated
spirits
over
sarah
momentary
brush
with
consciousness
lou
had
noticeably
less
of
a
hangover
than
was
usual
most
mornings
maybe
he
was
looking
forward
to
a
little
mental
r
r
for
my
own
part
i
felt
my
curiosity
growing
i
gone
to
a
lot
of
appointments
over
the
years
but
rarely
did
i
suspect
the
person
i
was
going
to
see
already
knew
more
about
me
than
i
knew
about
them
after
we
crossed
the
henry
hudson
bridge
we
left
the
highway
and
headed
down
a
service
road
that
led
toward
the
river
then
there
was
an
imposing
gate
open
and
a
driveway
finally
the
place
loomed
in
front
of
us
the
physical
appearance
of
quetzal
manor
was
a
study
in
european
grandeur
translated
with
a
few
extra
frills
from
the
new
world
carly
had
told
me
it
had
once
been
a
carmelite
convent
dating
from
sometime
in
the
middle
of
the
last
century
and
it
was
a
monument
to
church
authority
with
endless
arches
of
cut
stone
turrets
gargoyles
as
we
were
motoring
to
the
end
of
the
long
cobblestone
drive
i
felt
as
if
i
was
approaching
some
gothic
movie
set
given
its
hovering
sense
of
regal
authority
the
place
could
easily
have
been
a
castle
but
it
seemed
more
like
a
brooding
homage
to
medieval
torture
let
me
just
say
it
was
truly
magisterial
yet
also
more
than
a
little
creepy
as
we
parked
under
a
huge
oak
tree
in
front
i
surveyed
the
facade
trying
to
marshal
my
strength
enough
of
my
cold
still
lingered
that
i
did
feel
as
if
my
mind
was
working
on
all
cylinders
and
for
a
moment
i
merely
sat
looking
trying
to
breathe
want
me
to
go
in
with
you
lou
asked
finally
he
was
examining
the
building
suspiciously
like
a
detective
surveying
a
crime
scene
i
wanted
him
with
me
and
then
again
i
did
i
longed
for
the
company
a
protector
but
i
did
want
the
complications
more
things
to
explain
inside
finally
i
made
a
snap
decision
why
do
you
take
a
stroll
around
the
grounds
i
suggested
commune
with
nature
the
fresh
air
will
do
you
good
this
ca
take
long
mainly
i
just
want
to
get
some
literature
and
try
to
gain
a
feeling
for
the
place
that
was
entirely
or
even
partly
true
what
i
really
wanted
to
find
out
was
threefold
how
did
they
manage
to
get
beautiful
healthy
caucasian
babies
for
two
single
women
in
just
a
few
months
how
could
those
babies
be
only
six
months
apart
in
age
and
still
obviously
be
siblings
and
this
was
where
my
feelings
got
complicated
could
they
get
a
baby
for
me
the
same
way
never
mind
how
they
did
it
it
was
the
third
thing
that
actually
bothered
me
the
most
since
i
was
far
from
sure
i
wanted
to
be
a
part
of
whatever
was
going
on
lou
just
shrugged
and
leaned
back
in
his
seat
take
as
long
as
you
like
i
just
wait
here
in
the
car
i
not
the
nature
type
that
was
certainly
the
case
i
walked
across
the
cobblestones
to
an
arched
entryway
that
had
no
door
i
wondered
at
this
most
convents
are
like
a
fortress
and
then
i
realized
the
front
door
had
been
removed
leaving
only
its
ancient
hinges
still
bolted
into
the
stones
perhaps
it
was
intended
to
be
a
symbol
of
openness
inviting
you
in
there
was
no
sign
of
anybody
the
ramala
was
not
on
hand
to
greet
me
so
i
just
headed
on
down
a
wide
hallway
past
a
table
of
brochures
the
place
had
been
decorated
with
expensive
good
taste
tapestries
all
over
the
stone
walls
perfect
persian
rugs
classic
church
statuary
all
of
it
calling
forth
powerful
feelings
from
deep
in
the
psyche
then
i
entered
a
vast
interior
courtyard
where
a
central
fountain
splashed
cheerily
in
the
midday
light
the
courtyard
was
circled
with
a
picturesque
gallery
of
cells
all
with
massive
wooden
doors
most
likely
rooms
once
inhabited
by
chaste
sisters
the
place
did
seem
to
be
a
now
just
as
paula
had
said
not
nuns
this
time
around
but
rather
new
age
acolytes
whose
tastes
ran
more
to
secular
music
than
to
religious
chants
as
witness
the
cacophony
of
sounds
that
wafted
out
from
several
of
the
cells
only
it
was
any
kind
of
conventional
music
it
seemed
a
mixture
of
japanese
flute
north
indian
ragas
african
drumming
i
liked
the
ragas
even
recognized
my
favorite
bhairavi
then
i
spotted
something
that
riveted
my
attention
at
the
back
of
the
courtyard
just
past
a
final
wooden
door
stood
a
huge
south
indian
bronze
statue
about
five
feet
high
of
the
dancing
shiva
it
appeared
to
be
presiding
over
the
arch
way
that
led
out
into
a
dense
natural
garden
behind
the
building
i
walked
across
the
cobblestones
to
examine
and
admire
it
it
seemed
an
odd
item
to
find
here
in
the
courtyard
of
a
convent
i
was
so
enthralled
i
failed
to
hear
the
door
behind
me
open
do
you
find
my
shiva
interesting
ms
james
said
a
soothing
voice
just
barely
audible
above
the
chirps
of
birds
i
think
i
caught
a
breath
in
my
chest
but
then
i
turned
to
see
a
tall
man
dressed
in
casual
chinos
and
a
dark
sweater
he
was
trim
looked
to
be
in
his
early
sixties
with
a
mane
of
hair
and
lean
features
more
craggy
than
handsome
but
his
eyes
were
everything
telling
you
he
owned
the
space
around
him
owned
in
fact
the
air
he
breathed
it
had
to
be
alex
goddard
yes
i
answered
almost
before
i
thought
it
just
seems
to
be
a
little
out
of
place
here
i
wondered
if
he
was
going
to
introduce
himself
then
i
realized
that
when
you
used
to
being
the
master
of
a
private
domain
you
probably
never
think
to
bother
with
such
trivial
formalities
everybody
knows
who
you
are
well
he
said
his
voice
disarmingly
benign
i
suppose
i
must
beg
to
differ
may
i
suggest
you
consider
this
shiva
for
a
moment
and
try
to
imagine
he
a
real
god
he
is
a
real
god
i
said
immediately
feeling
patronized
nothing
makes
me
angry
faster
in
india
he
yes
he
said
i
know
you
did
a
film
about
india
which
i
found
quite
extraordinary
by
the
way
but
why
would
the
shiva
fit
right
in
here
you
see
he
a
very
modern
universal
figure
he
incorporates
everything
that
exists
in
the
contemporary
world
space
time
matter
and
energy
as
well
as
all
of
human
psychology
and
wisdom
i
aware
of
that
i
said
sensing
my
pique
increase
we
were
not
getting
off
to
a
great
start
yes
well
he
seemed
not
to
hear
me
instead
he
started
putting
on
the
leather
jacket
he
had
slung
over
his
shoulder
notice
that
shiva
has
four
arms
and
he
dancing
with
one
foot
raised
he
also
standing
inside
that
great
circle
of
flame
a
sort
of
halo
encompassing
his
whole
body
that
circle
stands
for
the
great
material
universe
all
of
it
dark
and
light
good
and
evil
he
knows
and
controls
everything
hey
i
realized
this
guy
got
some
kind
of
identity
thing
going
with
this
ancient
indian
god
he
continued
as
he
zipped
up
the
jacket
shiva
has
four
arms
because
let
me
tell
you
i
said
interrupting
him
he
looked
startled
clearly
not
accustomed
to
a
woman
meeting
him
on
his
own
ground
he
has
four
hands
because
he
has
a
lot
to
do
that
little
drum
in
his
upper
right
summons
things
into
existence
and
there
in
his
upper
left
he
holds
a
fire
that
destroys
goddard
was
examining
me
curiously
but
i
just
stared
back
and
continued
his
lower
right
hand
is
held
up
in
a
kind
of
benediction
as
if
to
say
your
peace
within
and
the
lower
left
points
down
at
his
feet
where
one
foot
is
planted
on
the
back
of
that
repulsive
little
dwarf
there
the
human
ego
crush
the
ego
and
be
free
the
other
foot
is
lifted
to
signify
spiritual
freedom
you
seem
to
know
the
shiva
well
he
broke
into
a
grudging
smile
as
though
we
just
met
chalk
up
round
one
as
a
draw
i
glad
you
came
james
i
a
great
admirer
of
your
work
and
i
especially
wanted
to
provide
your
orientation
personally
it
a
genuine
pleasure
to
meet
you
at
last
at
last
i
took
his
proffered
hand
and
stared
all
the
questions
been
brooding
over
for
the
past
week
sort
of
disappeared
into
a
memory
file
somewhere
instead
all
i
could
do
was
focus
in
on
him
meeting
carly
and
paula
miracle
worker
in
the
flesh
made
me
recall
something
aldous
huxley
once
observed
he
declared
that
the
kind
of
man
and
they
are
almost
always
men
who
can
control
others
with
his
mind
needs
to
have
certain
qualities
the
rest
of
us
can
only
envy
of
course
he
has
to
be
intelligent
and
have
a
range
of
knowledge
that
can
be
used
to
impress
people
but
most
of
all
he
has
to
have
a
will
of
iron
an
unswerving
tenacity
of
purpose
and
an
uncompromising
about
who
he
is
what
he
wants
this
means
a
slightly
remote
manner
a
glittering
eye
and
a
sympathetic
gaze
that
bores
in
deeply
on
you
one
minute
then
seems
off
in
another
realm
focused
on
infinity
the
next
perhaps
most
importantly
of
all
his
voice
must
be
that
of
a
pied
piper
a
soft
yet
penetrating
instrument
that
acts
directly
on
the
unconscious
of
his
listeners
even
though
he
was
doing
a
casual
number
with
me
my
first
impression
of
alex
goddard
was
that
he
perfectly
embodied
all
those
qualities
i
also
sensed
a
false
note
what
was
it
maybe
he
was
being
just
a
little
too
casual
if
you
here
about
doing
a
film
he
began
please
be
aware
we
do
not
encourage
publicity
if
you
come
because
of
your
infertility
as
ramala
said
you
mentioned
in
your
call
then
i
welcome
you
with
open
arms
well
he
knew
how
to
cut
to
the
chase
and
after
his
phone
call
to
try
to
intimidate
paula
marks
i
was
well
aware
he
did
encourage
publicity
but
now
i
also
realized
he
would
be
overly
interested
in
my
new
idea
of
someday
doing
a
documentary
on
this
place
but
then
a
lot
of
people
say
no
at
first
and
then
come
around
i
was
actually
interested
in
neither
i
said
feeling
my
sinuses
about
to
close
down
permanently
i
was
actually
hoping
to
find
out
about
your
adoption
service
how
it
works
ah
he
said
his
eyes
shifting
from
intense
scrutiny
to
somewhere
lost
in
the
ozone
that
not
something
i
handle
personally
in
any
case
you
first
must
come
and
participate
in
our
program
then
if
we
fail
to
achieve
your
objectives
we
can
take
the
adoption
matter
under
consideration
i
think
i
like
to
hear
about
it
anyway
i
took
a
deep
breath
again
groping
for
air
for
instance
where
and
how
you
get
the
children
you
place
i
see
he
said
calmly
as
though
my
question
were
about
the
weather
then
he
secured
his
coat
tighter
i
thinking
how
would
you
like
to
take
a
short
walk
down
to
the
river
we
could
get
to
know
each
other
better
i
just
nodded
not
looking
forward
to
the
harsh
wind
that
would
assault
my
inflamed
sinuses
but
maybe
i
was
getting
somewhere
as
we
started
out
through
the
stone
archway
and
into
the
rear
garden
which
seemed
to
extend
for
acres
he
continued
you
seem
to
have
a
lot
of
questions
about
what
i
doing
here
so
let
me
try
and
put
my
efforts
into
perspective
as
i
like
to
point
out
to
women
when
they
first
come
here
we
in
the
west
are
making
do
with
only
half
the
world
medical
knowledge
we
ignore
all
of
the
east
also
the
wisdom
of
the
indigenous
peoples
here
in
the
western
hemisphere
the
native
americans
who
are
we
to
say
they
do
have
a
lot
to
teach
he
smiled
as
though
embarrassed
to
be
passing
along
such
a
commonplace
for
example
western
medical
practice
virtually
until
this
century
consisted
mainly
of
using
leeches
to
drain
away
in
the
blood
at
the
same
time
the
indigenous
peoples
of
this
continent
knew
more
about
the
curative
powers
of
plants
even
drugs
than
europe
ever
dreamed
of
yet
they
were
deemed
savages
i
was
sure
where
he
was
leading
but
the
supreme
with
which
he
spoke
had
the
effect
of
sweeping
me
along
the
engaging
eyes
the
voice
the
designer
jacket
it
all
worked
he
was
good
very
good
so
you
see
he
went
on
what
i
tried
to
achieve
here
at
quetzal
manor
is
to
integrate
the
knowledge
of
east
and
west
ancient
and
modern
so
what
exactly
do
you
well
first
let
me
explain
that
i
studied
in
the
far
east
for
over
a
decade
until
i
understood
how
to
control
the
energy
flows
in
the
body
your
chi
then
i
moved
to
central
america
where
i
learned
all
that
is
currently
known
about
native
american
practices
and
medicines
i
still
have
a
special
place
there
where
i
carry
out
pharmacological
research
on
the
rare
plants
of
that
area
studying
their
effects
on
human
fertility
on
the
origins
of
life
i
have
no
time
to
waste
on
disease
and
degeneration
we
were
well
into
his
rear
garden
now
which
had
lots
of
herbs
and
was
also
part
orchard
there
were
apple
trees
and
other
fruit
trees
i
could
readily
identify
all
just
starting
to
show
their
first
buds
when
we
came
to
the
end
there
was
a
cobblestone
path
leading
west
in
what
seemed
only
a
few
moments
we
reached
a
line
of
bluffs
overlooking
the
hudson
the
early
spring
wind
was
cutting
into
my
face
causing
my
nostrils
to
feel
on
fire
as
we
stood
gazing
down
at
the
rippling
waters
of
the
hudson
below
where
a
lone
sailboat
was
caught
in
the
breeze
the
moment
took
on
a
timelessness
feeling
as
though
it
could
have
been
any
place
any
century
incidentally
he
went
on
turning
slightly
to
me
are
you
familiar
with
the
name
asklepios
i
had
to
shake
my
head
no
it
sounded
vaguely
familiar
but
he
was
the
ancient
greek
god
of
medicine
the
physicians
who
revered
him
held
that
sickness
could
be
cured
using
drugs
and
potions
that
came
from
outside
the
body
since
they
believed
that
where
disease
originated
now
of
course
industries
thrive
by
enhancing
our
arsenal
of
antibiotics
i
listened
to
this
wondering
where
he
was
headed
then
he
told
me
there
was
however
another
school
of
healing
at
that
time
those
who
honored
the
daughter
of
asklepios
she
was
hygeia
their
goddess
of
health
the
hygeians
believed
that
wellness
originated
from
properly
governing
your
own
body
for
them
the
greatest
service
of
the
physician
was
to
learn
how
we
can
work
with
our
bodies
their
ideal
was
healing
from
within
rather
than
intervention
from
without
again
he
was
studying
me
as
though
trying
to
determine
whether
i
was
going
along
with
what
he
was
saying
unfortunately
he
continued
the
hygeian
school
more
or
less
died
out
in
the
west
however
it
lives
on
in
other
places
for
example
primitive
peoples
have
no
manufactured
synthetic
drugs
so
they
use
natural
herbs
to
enhance
their
own
immune
system
and
stay
healthy
he
turned
to
study
the
river
dropping
into
silence
maybe
i
missing
something
i
declared
finally
his
hypnotic
voice
had
drawn
me
in
in
spite
of
myself
how
does
this
relate
to
infertility
he
turned
back
and
caught
me
with
his
shining
eyes
they
seemed
to
be
giving
off
heat
of
their
own
just
as
the
body
is
intended
to
heal
itself
so
is
a
woman
womb
meant
to
create
life
if
she
childless
the
reason
more
often
than
not
is
that
her
body
is
out
of
harmony
with
itself
what
i
do
here
is
seek
out
each
woman
unique
energy
flows
and
attempt
to
restore
them
using
eastern
practices
and
hygeian
herbal
therapies
does
it
always
succeed
i
abruptly
wondered
if
his
techniques
might
work
for
me
face
it
western
medicine
had
completely
struck
out
the
problem
was
the
guy
was
just
a
little
too
smooth
not
always
some
women
bodies
are
naturally
unresponsive
just
as
all
organisms
are
subject
to
random
irregularities
in
those
cases
i
try
to
provide
her
a
child
by
other
means
you
mean
adoption
i
suggested
by
whatever
means
seems
appropriate
he
replied
cryptically
well
there
something
i
like
to
understand
last
week
i
met
a
woman
who
had
adopted
a
baby
boy
through
children
of
light
she
got
him
in
three
months
such
a
thing
is
according
to
what
i
can
find
out
totally
unheard
of
so
how
did
you
manage
that
he
stared
down
at
the
river
i
thought
i
explained
that
adoptions
are
not
what
we
primarily
do
here
they
provided
only
as
a
last
resort
in
the
few
cases
where
my
regimen
of
hygeian
therapies
fails
but
in
those
cases
where
do
you
find
as
i
said
before
we
talk
about
adoption
first
we
need
to
satisfy
ourselves
that
no
other
options
are
possible
then
his
eyes
clicked
into
me
if
you
could
come
back
next
saturday
to
begin
your
tests
and
receive
an
orientation
i
could
give
you
an
opinion
about
your
chances
of
bearing
a
child
it
will
require
a
thorough
examination
but
i
can
usually
tell
with
a
good
degree
of
certainty
whether
my
program
can
help
someone
or
not
it
really
important
though
that
you
stay
at
least
he
was
staring
at
me
mind
if
i
do
something
that
might
relieve
some
of
the
symptoms
of
that
cold
he
reached
out
and
touched
my
temples
with
his
long
lean
fingers
then
he
placed
his
thumbs
just
above
my
eyebrows
and
pressed
very
hard
after
a
long
moment
he
slowly
moved
the
pressure
down
to
the
bridge
of
my
nose
then
across
under
my
eyes
finally
he
put
the
heel
of
his
hands
just
above
my
ears
and
pressed
again
after
a
couple
of
seconds
he
stepped
away
and
continued
talking
as
though
nothing
had
happened
after
i
give
you
a
full
examination
we
can
discuss
our
next
step
with
that
he
turned
ready
to
head
back
now
if
you
excuse
me
got
a
lot
of
research
data
to
organize
i
guess
he
assumed
his
juggernaut
of
arcane
medical
theory
had
rolled
over
me
sufficiently
that
he
could
move
on
to
other
matters
i
sensed
he
really
wanted
me
to
come
back
but
he
was
careful
to
wind
down
our
mutual
interview
with
a
air
all
the
same
i
felt
intrigued
as
we
moved
back
through
the
gardens
and
then
into
the
courtyard
a
baby
maybe
he
could
make
it
happen
for
steve
and
me
in
spite
of
myself
i
felt
a
moment
of
hope
thank
you
for
coming
he
said
by
way
of
farewell
just
brushing
my
hand
then
turned
and
disappeared
through
one
of
the
ancient
wooden
doors
along
the
veranda
leaving
me
alone
well
i
thought
the
calm
voice
and
casual
outfit
are
probably
just
part
of
his
bedside
manner
but
you
ca
be
near
alex
goddard
and
not
feel
a
definite
sense
of
carefully
controlled
power
but
is
his
power
being
used
for
good
this
was
the
man
whose
staff
was
trying
to
deny
me
interviews
with
mothers
who
adopted
through
children
of
light
and
what
about
the
hispanic
hood
with
the
gun
did
alex
goddard
send
him
if
not
his
appearance
at
paula
building
was
one
hell
of
a
coincidence
so
why
should
i
trust
that
was
when
i
noticed
it
my
lingering
cold
had
miraculously
vanished
inflamed
sinuses
and
all
i
was
breathing
normally
and
even
my
chest
felt
cleared
my
god
i
thought
what
did
he
do
hypnotize
me
it
was
as
though
a
week
healing
had
passed
through
my
body
i
had
an
epiphany
a
moment
that
galvanizes
your
resolve
i
had
to
do
a
documentary
about
this
man
to
find
out
what
he
was
really
up
to
mentioned
he
had
a
place
in
central
america
was
that
the
source
of
his
special
techniques
some
kind
of
ancient
medical
practices
he
discovered
he
claimed
he
did
want
any
publicity
but
that
always
just
an
opening
move
when
somebody
says
that
what
they
really
mean
is
they
do
want
any
bad
publicity
they
just
want
to
have
final
say
about
what
you
produce
there
ways
to
handle
the
problem
i
liberated
a
brochure
from
the
hall
table
on
my
way
out
thinking
i
would
study
it
soon
very
closely
i
had
a
nose
for
a
good
story
and
this
one
felt
right
when
i
got
back
to
the
car
lou
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
he
given
me
the
impression
he
intended
merely
to
sit
there
and
doze
while
i
went
inside
but
now
he
was
gone
then
he
appeared
emerging
from
the
forest
of
trees
actually
there
was
another
building
opposite
the
stone
drive
that
i
had
noticed
at
first
hmmm
i
thought
i
wonder
what
that
all
about
for
some
reason
alex
goddard
had
offered
me
a
tour
he
taken
me
for
a
stroll
in
the
opposite
direction
that
was
fast
lou
said
settling
into
the
car
you
get
what
you
came
for
the
answer
to
that
was
both
yes
and
no
in
a
sense
i
gotten
considerably
more
than
i
bargained
for
he
wants
me
to
come
back
i
said
and
i
think
i
might
do
it
a
lot
more
going
on
with
alex
goddard
than
you
know
from
just
looking
at
this
place
the
trick
is
to
stay
in
control
when
you
around
him
i
tossed
the
brochure
into
lou
lap
as
i
started
the
engine
he
took
it
and
immediately
began
looking
through
it
lou
i
knew
was
a
man
always
interested
in
facts
and
figures
as
we
headed
toward
the
parkway
he
was
pouring
through
the
brochure
with
intense
interest
even
as
i
tried
to
give
him
a
brief
reprise
of
alex
goddard
medical
philosophy
it
says
here
his
patients
come
from
all
over
the
united
states
and
europe
he
noted
finally
interrupting
me
i
found
nothing
odd
in
that
and
went
back
to
rambling
on
about
quetzal
manor
give
the
place
its
due
it
was
placid
and
tranquil
and
smacked
of
the
benign
spirituality
goddard
claimed
to
put
so
much
stock
in
still
i
found
it
unsettling
however
lou
as
usual
chose
to
see
matters
his
own
way
he
been
studying
the
fine
print
at
the
back
of
the
brochure
mumbling
to
himself
and
then
he
emitted
a
grunt
of
discovery
ah
here
what
i
was
looking
for
he
declared
you
know
as
a
registered
new
york
state
adoption
agency
this
outfit
has
got
to
divulge
the
number
of
babies
they
placed
during
their
last
yearly
reporting
period
according
to
him
he
only
resorts
to
adoption
if
he
ca
cure
your
infertility
with
his
special
regimen
i
reminded
him
your
energy
flows
no
shit
lou
observed
then
went
on
well
then
i
guess
his
energy
flows
whatever
bullshit
must
fail
a
lot
because
last
year
the
number
was
just
under
two
hundred
so
at
sixty
thou
a
pop
like
it
says
here
we
talking
about
twelve
million
smackeroos
gross
in
a
year
not
a
bad
way
to
fail
huh
i
caught
myself
emitting
a
soft
whistle
as
he
read
out
the
number
there
was
definitely
a
lot
more
going
on
with
alex
goddard
than
met
the
eye
so
what
he
do
with
all
that
dough
lou
mused
better
question
still
where
in
the
hell
did
he
find
two
hundred
fresh
orphaned
babies
all
listed
here
as
caucasian
and
get
this
the
ages
reported
at
final
processing
are
all
just
a
couple
of
months
give
or
take
good
questions
i
thought
maybe
that
the
reason
he
does
want
publicity
it
sounds
a
little
too
commercial
for
a
guru
my
other
thought
was
with
so
many
babies
somehow
available
why
was
alex
goddard
so
reluctant
to
even
discuss
adoption
with
me
the
answer
i
was
sure
lay
in
the
fact
he
already
knew
more
about
me
than
i
knew
about
him
he
knew
i
was
making
a
film
about
adoption
how
did
he
come
by
that
knowledge
i
kept
wondering
and
he
was
concerned
he
might
be
mentioned
in
it
i
kept
asking
myself
why
on
our
drive
back
down
the
henry
hudson
parkway
i
decided
i
was
definitely
looking
at
a
documentary
in
the
making
i
just
had
to
decide
whether
to
do
it
with
or
without
his
cooperation
chapter
six
after
i
dropped
off
lou
at
his
space
in
soho
where
he
was
house
sitting
for
an
estate
now
in
the
courts
i
decided
to
head
on
home
the
more
i
thought
about
alex
goddard
the
more
i
felt
frustrated
and
even
a
little
angry
that
i
completely
failed
to
find
out
any
of
the
things
i
wanted
to
learn
about
him
i
replayed
our
interview
in
my
mind
got
nowhere
and
then
decided
to
push
away
thoughts
of
quetzal
manor
for
a
while
and
dwell
on
something
else
sarah
my
film
anything
it
was
saturday
and
unfortunately
i
had
no
plans
for
the
evening
translation
no
steve
back
to
where
i
started
how
many
million
stories
in
the
naked
city
and
i
was
just
so
many
million
plus
one
it
not
a
jungle
out
there
it
a
desert
the
truth
was
after
steve
took
off
i
had
really
been
trying
all
that
hard
to
pick
myself
up
off
the
canvas
and
look
around
besides
i
did
want
some
other
guy
i
wanted
him
added
to
that
i
somehow
felt
that
when
you
on
the
short
countdown
for
forty
you
should
have
to
be
going
out
on
blind
dates
wondering
whether
that
mba
sitting
across
from
you
in
some
trendy
italian
restaurant
thinks
you
a
blimp
even
though
you
skipped
lunch
telling
yourself
presentable
does
seem
like
a
serial
killer
has
a
job
only
mentioned
his
mother
once
and
could
qualify
as
an
acceptable
mate
there
no
spark
but
he
probably
quite
nice
you
wanly
remember
that
old
barney
ad
jingle
select
do
settle
but
at
this
stage
of
life
you
ready
to
admit
you
flunked
out
in
love
and
should
just
go
with
like
which
was
one
of
the
reasons
i
missed
steve
so
deeply
he
was
a
lover
but
he
was
also
a
best
friend
and
i
was
running
low
on
those
every
woman
needs
a
best
pal
after
my
former
best
betsy
married
joel
aimes
latest
contribution
to
dreamworks
and
moved
to
the
coast
with
him
i
was
noticing
a
lot
of
empty
evenings
in
the
old
days
we
could
talk
for
hours
it
was
funny
since
we
were
actually
very
different
betsy
who
had
forgotten
more
about
clothes
and
makeup
than
most
women
would
ever
know
hung
around
the
showrooms
and
always
came
away
with
samples
of
next
season
couture
usually
for
a
song
i
envied
her
that
since
i
usually
just
pretended
not
to
care
and
pulled
on
another
pair
of
jeans
every
morning
but
she
shared
my
love
of
asian
music
anyway
now
she
was
gone
and
i
could
tell
we
were
working
hard
enough
at
staying
in
touch
she
and
joel
had
just
moved
to
a
new
apartment
and
i
did
even
have
her
latest
phone
number
which
brought
me
back
to
steve
i
often
wondered
why
we
were
so
alike
and
i
finally
decided
it
was
because
we
both
started
from
the
same
place
spiritually
in
his
case
that
place
was
a
crummy
childhood
in
new
haven
which
he
did
want
to
talk
about
much
because
i
gathered
it
was
as
lonely
and
deprived
as
my
own
or
at
least
as
depressing
his
father
had
owned
a
small
candy
store
and
had
wanted
all
his
four
children
to
become
professionals
the
oldest
had
become
a
lawyer
the
next
a
teacher
when
steve
turn
came
he
was
told
he
should
become
a
doctor
or
at
the
very
least
a
dentist
did
happen
he
managed
four
years
of
premed
at
yale
but
then
he
rebelled
cashed
in
his
scholarship
and
went
to
paris
to
study
photography
the
result
was
he
done
what
he
wanted
been
reasonably
successful
at
it
and
his
father
had
never
forgiven
him
i
think
he
was
still
striving
for
the
old
man
approval
even
after
all
the
years
but
i
doubted
he
ever
get
it
steve
was
a
guy
still
coming
to
grips
with
things
that
could
be
changed
but
in
the
meantime
he
lived
in
worlds
that
were
as
different
from
his
own
past
as
he
could
find
he
deliberately
avoided
comforts
and
was
never
happier
than
when
he
was
in
some
miserable
speck
on
the
map
where
you
could
drink
the
water
whatever
else
it
was
it
new
haven
thinking
about
him
at
that
moment
i
had
an
almost
irresistible
desire
to
reach
for
my
cell
phone
and
call
him
god
i
missed
him
did
he
miss
me
the
same
way
i
wanted
so
much
to
hear
him
say
it
i
had
a
contact
number
for
him
in
belize
city
an
old
hotel
called
the
bellevue
where
they
still
served
high
tea
but
i
always
seemed
to
call
when
he
was
out
somewhere
in
the
rain
forest
shooting
do
it
do
be
a
wuss
but
then
i
got
cold
feet
did
i
want
him
to
think
i
was
chasing
after
him
i
did
want
to
sound
needy
though
that
was
exactly
what
i
felt
like
at
the
moment
finally
i
decided
to
just
invent
a
phone
conversation
recreating
one
from
times
past
one
where
we
both
felt
secure
enough
to
be
flip
it
was
something
i
did
more
than
i
like
to
admit
usually
there
be
eight
rings
at
his
park
slope
loft
and
then
a
harried
voice
yes
steve
talk
to
me
yo
this
is
not
a
recording
i
am
just
in
a
transcendent
plane
and
if
that
you
murray
i
have
the
contact
sheets
there
by
six
patience
is
a
virtue
honey
it
me
get
out
of
the
darkroom
get
a
life
oh
hi
baby
finally
tuning
in
i
working
in
a
quest
for
unrelenting
pictorial
truth
but
mainly
i
thinking
of
you
you
printing
right
darling
it
lunch
hour
do
you
feel
guilty
working
all
the
time
the
truth
was
it
was
one
of
the
reasons
i
respected
him
so
much
he
even
did
his
own
contacts
his
fervor
matched
my
drive
it
what
made
us
perfect
mates
i
got
tons
of
guilt
but
i
trying
to
get
past
it
become
a
full
human
person
go
back
to
the
dawn
of
man
paint
my
face
and
dance
in
a
thunderstorm
he
pause
as
though
starting
to
get
oriented
hey
look
at
the
time
christ
i
got
a
print
shoot
on
street
at
three
he
was
chasing
a
bit
of
fashion
work
to
supplement
his
magazine
assignments
love
i
said
in
my
reverie
can
you
come
over
tonight
i
promise
to
make
it
worth
your
while
it
involves
a
bubble
bath
champagne
roses
everywhere
sensuous
ragas
on
the
cd
and
maybe
some
crispy
oysters
or
something
sent
in
later
on
just
to
keep
us
going
then
i
listen
to
the
tone
of
his
voice
knowing
he
say
yes
but
putting
more
stock
in
how
he
said
it
still
he
always
gave
his
lines
a
good
read
then
why
do
we
aim
for
about
nine
i
go
on
blissful
that
ought
to
give
me
a
chance
to
get
organized
and
do
bring
anything
except
your
luscious
self
the
fantasy
was
coming
together
in
my
mind
thinking
back
i
realized
how
much
i
missed
him
all
over
again
that
was
when
the
phone
on
the
armrest
beside
me
rang
for
real
for
a
moment
i
was
so
startled
i
almost
hit
the
brakes
then
i
clicked
it
on
my
mind
still
buzzing
about
steve
and
also
in
spite
of
my
resolve
about
the
curious
runaround
i
just
gotten
from
alex
goddard
listen
there
was
a
message
on
my
machine
when
i
came
in
i
got
to
go
up
to
the
hospital
right
now
lou
voice
was
brimming
with
hope
and
exuberance
they
said
sarah
was
stirring
opened
her
eyes
and
started
talking
they
said
she
not
making
much
sense
but
oh
god
that
wonderful
i
felt
my
heart
expanding
with
life
for
some
reason
i
had
a
flash
of
memory
of
her
climbing
up
into
the
rickety
little
tree
house
well
more
like
a
platform
i
helped
her
build
in
my
thirteenth
summer
no
boys
invited
to
assist
a
year
later
that
part
had
seemed
terminally
dumb
i
meet
you
there
i
was
almost
home
but
i
screeched
the
car
around
and
headed
east
racing
over
though
i
tried
not
to
wish
for
too
much
i
kept
remembering
all
the
stages
to
a
complete
recovery
and
telling
myself
that
whatever
had
happened
it
was
only
the
first
step
on
a
very
long
very
scary
journey
i
had
realized
how
scary
till
i
walked
into
the
room
lou
who
had
gotten
there
just
minutes
before
i
did
was
sitting
by
her
side
holding
her
hand
his
gaze
transfixed
on
her
she
was
propped
up
slightly
in
her
bed
two
pillows
fluffed
behind
her
head
staring
dreamily
at
the
ceiling
three
attentive
nurses
were
standing
around
the
sides
of
her
bed
their
eyes
wide
as
though
sarah
were
a
ghost
i
very
quickly
realized
why
she
was
spinning
out
a
fantasy
that
could
only
come
from
a
deranged
mind
had
she
regained
consciousness
only
to
talk
madness
lou
does
she
recognize
you
i
asked
he
just
shook
his
head
sadly
never
taking
his
eyes
off
her
face
she
was
weaving
in
and
out
of
reality
pausing
stuttering
uncertain
of
her
incoherent
brain
once
when
she
fallen
off
a
swing
and
got
knocked
out
for
a
brief
moment
she
came
to
talking
nonsense
now
she
seemed
exactly
the
same
way
lights
so
bright
she
mumbled
starting
up
again
to
recount
what
seemed
to
be
a
faraway
fantasy
like
now
why
why
are
there
lights
here
her
lips
were
moving
but
her
eyes
were
still
fixed
in
a
stare
then
with
that
last
odd
question
her
gaze
began
to
dart
about
the
room
looking
for
someone
who
present
she
settled
on
me
for
a
moment
and
i
felt
a
chill
from
her
plaintive
vulnerability
when
i
tried
to
look
back
as
benignly
and
lovingly
as
possible
i
could
help
noticing
how
drawn
her
cheeks
were
doubtless
from
the
constant
iv
feeding
and
again
my
heart
went
out
i
scared
she
went
on
but
i
here
honey
lou
declared
bending
over
her
his
eyes
pained
do
you
know
who
i
am
the
jade
face
a
mask
she
babbled
on
still
ignoring
him
all
the
colors
it
so
so
beautiful
her
hallucination
did
relate
to
anything
i
could
understand
she
clearly
was
off
in
another
world
like
when
she
was
a
kid
weaving
the
lights
of
the
room
now
into
some
kind
of
dream
i
touched
shoulder
and
asked
permission
to
turn
off
the
overhead
fluorescents
but
he
just
shrugged
me
off
his
attention
focused
entirely
on
her
his
eyes
had
grown
puzzled
as
though
he
wanted
to
believe
she
was
returning
to
rationality
but
his
common
sense
was
telling
him
it
true
i
was
having
a
different
reaction
what
she
was
saying
was
random
babblings
all
right
but
i
was
beginning
to
think
she
was
reliving
something
she
had
actually
seen
however
she
was
through
i
want
to
pray
but
the
white
tunnel
is
coming
she
shuddered
then
almost
tried
to
smile
take
me
she
was
gone
her
eyelids
fluttering
uncontrollably
honey
talk
to
me
lou
pleaded
he
was
crying
something
i
never
seen
him
do
something
i
was
not
even
aware
he
was
capable
of
what
he
really
was
trying
to
say
was
come
back
it
was
happening
she
stared
blankly
at
the
ceiling
for
a
moment
then
slowly
closed
her
eyes
a
shutter
descending
over
her
soul
she
be
okay
i
whispered
to
him
almost
believing
it
her
brain
had
undergone
a
physical
trauma
enough
to
cause
a
coma
but
some
kind
of
mental
trauma
must
have
preceded
it
was
she
now
trying
to
exorcise
that
as
part
of
her
path
to
recovery
the
nurses
in
the
room
stirred
perhaps
not
sure
what
to
do
the
overhead
lights
were
still
dazzlingly
bright
and
i
moved
to
shut
them
off
leaving
only
a
behind
the
bed
perhaps
the
lights
had
brought
her
awake
but
i
was
convinced
what
she
just
gone
through
had
tired
her
to
the
point
that
she
would
not
revive
again
that
day
then
one
of
the
caribbean
nurses
came
over
and
placed
her
hand
on
shoulder
she
had
an
experienced
face
full
of
something
about
her
inspired
trust
i
would
let
this
upset
you
too
much
she
said
a
lovely
lilt
in
her
voice
what
just
happened
may
or
may
not
mean
anything
when
patients
first
come
out
of
a
coma
they
can
sometimes
talk
just
fine
and
yet
not
make
any
sense
they
ramble
on
about
things
they
dreamed
of
like
they
were
real
then
she
smiled
but
it
a
good
first
step
she
could
wake
up
perfectly
fine
tomorrow
just
do
pay
any
attention
to
what
she
says
for
a
while
she
dreaming
now
lou
grunted
as
though
he
believed
her
i
nodded
in
sympathy
though
no
one
seemed
to
notice
i
also
thought
that
although
what
sarah
had
said
was
bizarre
it
sounded
like
something
more
than
a
dream
or
had
she
gone
back
to
her
where
imaginary
worlds
were
real
for
her
then
in
the
dim
glare
of
her
bed
light
lou
took
a
wrinkled
blue
booklet
out
of
his
inner
pocket
and
stared
at
it
i
had
to
stare
at
it
a
moment
before
i
realized
it
was
a
passport
what
the
american
consulate
in
merida
mexico
sent
it
up
to
federal
plaza
yesterday
because
my
name
and
office
address
are
penciled
on
the
inside
cover
as
an
emergency
contact
the
police
down
there
said
somebody
some
gringo
tourist
way
down
on
the
usumacinta
river
near
where
the
rio
tigre
comes
in
from
guatemala
snagged
this
floating
in
a
plastic
bag
he
turned
it
in
to
the
mexican
authorities
there
and
it
ended
up
with
our
people
he
opened
the
passport
and
stared
at
it
the
photo
and
id
page
is
ripped
out
but
it
definitely
sarah
he
handed
it
over
guy
i
know
downtown
dropped
it
off
last
night
i
not
sure
if
it
has
anything
to
tell
us
but
now
i
was
hoping
it
might
help
jog
her
memory
i
took
it
the
cover
so
waterlogged
its
color
was
almost
gone
however
it
must
have
been
kept
dry
in
the
plastic
bag
for
at
least
some
of
its
trip
from
wherever
since
much
of
the
damage
seemed
recent
lou
shook
his
head
staring
wistfully
at
me
i
still
do
know
how
she
got
down
there
she
was
in
california
remember
that
postcard
if
come
back
east
she
have
got
in
touch
would
she
his
eyes
pleaded
for
my
agreement
i
did
know
what
to
say
so
i
just
shrugged
i
wanted
to
be
sympathetic
but
i
refused
to
lie
outright
he
took
my
ambivalence
as
assent
as
he
pulled
out
the
locket
containing
her
picture
his
talisman
he
fingered
it
for
a
moment
staring
into
space
and
then
he
looked
down
and
opened
it
as
if
seeing
her
high
school
picture
from
a
time
when
she
was
well
would
somehow
ease
his
mind
this
whole
thing
does
sound
like
her
he
went
on
know
what
i
think
she
was
being
held
down
there
against
her
will
my
heart
went
out
to
him
and
i
reached
over
and
took
the
locket
for
a
moment
feeling
the
strong
src
engraved
on
its
face
lou
she
going
to
come
out
of
it
and
when
she
does
she
probably
explain
everything
she
going
to
be
okay
any
day
now
i
got
a
hunch
a
gut
feeling
i
had
a
gut
feeling
all
right
but
not
that
she
was
going
to
be
fine
my
real
fear
was
she
was
going
to
wake
up
a
child
again
then
i
handed
the
locket
back
he
seemed
to
turn
anxious
without
it
he
took
the
silver
heart
and
just
stared
down
at
it
in
the
silence
that
settled
over
us
i
decided
to
take
a
closer
look
at
the
passport
i
supposed
lou
had
already
gone
through
it
but
maybe
he
missed
something
as
i
flipped
through
the
waterlogged
pages
i
came
across
a
smudgy
imprint
caked
with
a
thin
layer
of
dried
river
clay
that
was
almost
too
dim
to
be
noticed
lou
did
you
see
this
i
held
it
under
the
light
and
beckoned
him
over
can
you
read
it
probably
not
without
my
specs
he
took
it
and
squinted
helplessly
my
eyes
are
getting
any
better
i
took
it
back
and
rubbed
at
the
page
cleaning
it
it
was
hard
to
make
out
but
it
looked
like
delegacion
de
migracion
aeropuerto
internacional
guatemala
i
think
this
is
a
guatemalan
tourist
entry
visa
i
raised
the
passport
up
to
backlight
the
page
and
see
that
faint
bit
there
in
the
center
that
probably
her
entry
date
written
in
by
hand
he
took
it
and
squinted
again
i
ca
read
the
damned
thing
but
you
right
there
some
numbers
or
something
scribbled
in
i
took
it
and
rubbed
the
page
till
i
could
read
it
clearly
it
march
eleventh
and
it
was
last
year
hot
damn
let
me
see
that
he
seized
it
back
and
squinted
for
a
long
moment
lifting
the
page
even
closer
to
the
light
you
right
he
held
it
for
a
second
more
then
turned
to
me
this
is
finally
the
thing
i
needed
now
i
damned
well
going
to
find
out
what
she
was
doing
down
there
how
do
you
think
you
can
do
that
i
just
looked
at
him
my
mind
not
quite
taking
in
what
he
just
said
the
airlines
he
almost
grinned
if
they
can
keep
track
of
everybody
damned
miles
for
years
and
years
they
undoubtedly
got
flight
manifests
stored
away
somewhere
too
so
my
first
step
is
to
find
out
where
she
flew
from
but
we
do
know
which
does
matter
he
squinted
again
at
the
passport
now
we
know
for
sure
she
showed
up
at
the
airport
in
guatemala
city
on
that
date
there
i
know
somebody
downtown
smooth
black
guy
named
john
williams
the
fbi
best
computer
nerd
who
could
bend
a
rule
for
me
and
do
a
little
b
e
in
cyberspace
he
owes
me
a
couple
so
if
she
was
on
a
manifest
for
a
scheduled
flight
into
guatemala
city
that
day
he
find
it
then
we
know
where
she
left
from
who
else
was
on
the
plane
he
tapped
the
passport
confidently
with
his
forefinger
maybe
she
was
traveling
with
some
scumbag
i
ought
to
look
up
and
get
to
know
better
well
good
luck
in
a
way
i
was
wondering
if
we
were
both
now
grasping
for
a
miracle
me
for
a
baby
through
some
new
age
process
of
centering
lou
trying
to
reclaim
sarah
from
her
mental
abyss
with
his
gruff
love
but
then
again
miracles
have
been
known
to
happen
chapter
seven
quetzal
manor
could
have
the
makings
of
a
great
documentary
i
was
explaining
to
david
roth
i
just
need
some
more
first
to
get
a
better
feeling
for
what
alex
goddard
is
up
to
so
going
back
up
there
will
be
two
birds
with
one
stone
i
learn
more
about
him
and
he
might
even
be
able
to
tell
me
why
i
have
been
able
to
get
pregnant
he
was
frowning
his
usual
skeptical
self
how
long
it
just
for
the
weekend
or
maybe
a
little
i
not
sure
exactly
i
guess
it
depends
on
what
kinds
of
tests
he
going
to
run
but
the
thing
is
i
have
to
do
it
now
while
he
and
i
are
still
clicking
an
is
hot
kind
of
moment
the
only
possible
problem
might
be
if
i
have
to
push
back
my
schedule
for
looping
dialogue
for
love
then
somebody
out
of
town
you
check
with
the
sound
studio
to
warn
them
about
possible
rescheduling
he
wanted
to
appear
to
be
fuming
but
since
he
invited
me
down
to
his
tribeca
loft
at
least
once
every
three
months
now
that
i
finally
shown
up
he
also
had
a
small
gleam
in
his
eye
what
did
that
mean
yes
but
i
already
spotted
most
of
the
work
print
and
i
made
tentative
dates
for
people
to
come
in
in
a
week
and
a
half
everything
still
on
schedule
he
leaned
back
on
his
white
couch
as
though
trying
to
regroup
it
was
saturday
morning
and
i
already
made
the
appointment
to
see
alex
goddard
i
was
going
i
probably
should
have
run
it
by
david
first
but
damnit
it
was
my
life
truthfully
though
i
been
dreading
telling
him
all
week
so
to
try
and
make
him
as
congenial
as
possible
i
arranged
to
see
him
at
home
and
relaxed
it
seemed
to
be
working
more
or
less
okay
okay
sometimes
i
guess
it
best
to
just
go
with
your
gut
he
said
beginning
to
calm
down
he
offered
to
whip
up
some
brunch
when
i
first
arrived
and
now
i
was
feeling
sorry
i
turned
him
down
i
really
did
like
him
but
alas
only
as
a
friend
before
i
cave
in
totally
though
do
me
a
favor
and
tell
me
some
more
about
this
documentary
what
exactly
makes
you
think
it
everything
whereupon
i
laid
on
him
the
full
story
of
carly
and
paula
the
children
and
my
encounter
with
alex
goddard
the
only
thing
i
left
out
was
the
story
of
the
hispanic
hood
since
i
did
think
he
could
handle
it
this
quetzal
manor
sounds
like
a
funny
operation
he
declared
solemnly
when
i
finished
i
say
the
less
you
have
to
do
with
a
place
like
that
the
better
who
knows
what
going
on
but
david
that
what
makes
it
so
interesting
the
fact
that
it
a
operation
i
really
can
see
a
documentary
here
after
baby
love
is
in
the
can
but
i
never
have
a
chance
if
i
do
get
to
know
this
guy
while
i
got
a
good
excuse
that
how
my
business
works
so
you
going
to
go
back
up
there
and
is
this
like
going
undercover
or
something
well
what
was
i
going
to
say
i
was
actually
half
beginning
to
believe
that
alex
goddard
might
be
able
to
figure
out
why
steve
and
i
could
conceive
it
was
certainly
worth
a
few
days
of
my
life
documentary
or
no
documentary
look
i
really
want
to
find
out
going
on
for
a
lot
of
reasons
he
sighed
and
sipped
at
his
coffee
morgy
this
has
got
to
be
quick
nicky
russo
called
again
the
thing
i
learned
about
loan
sharks
they
keep
your
books
better
than
you
do
he
knows
exactly
how
much
money
we
got
left
and
how
long
we
can
last
he
licking
his
chops
getting
ready
to
eat
us
whole
what
did
you
tell
him
the
very
thought
of
nicky
gave
me
a
chill
if
we
missed
so
much
as
a
week
on
the
juice
he
have
the
legal
right
to
just
seize
my
negative
when
you
desperate
you
sign
those
kinds
of
loans
i
told
him
something
i
have
even
told
you
yet
he
smiled
a
wicked
grin
i
know
you
been
schmoozing
lifetime
about
a
cable
deal
but
before
we
put
the
ink
to
that
i
want
to
finish
some
new
talks
started
with
orion
their
distribution
people
i
think
i
stopped
breathing
for
a
second
or
two
was
there
a
chance
for
a
theatrical
release
for
not
just
a
cable
deal
when
you
actually
met
with
them
how
late
yesterday
he
was
still
grinning
i
ran
into
jerry
reiner
at
morton
and
pitched
the
picture
actually
i
heard
he
was
in
town
so
i
wore
a
tie
and
ambushed
him
at
lunch
he
wants
to
see
a
rough
cut
as
soon
as
we
got
something
ready
david
you
an
angel
i
was
ecstatic
it
was
more
than
i
dared
hope
for
so
stay
focused
for
chrissake
and
finish
your
picture
we
this
close
to
saving
our
collective
asses
so
do
blow
it
i
gone
over
all
the
schedules
pretty
carefully
and
i
guess
we
can
spare
a
day
or
two
but
if
you
drag
this
out
i
going
to
read
you
your
contract
the
fine
print
about
due
diligence
and
then
finish
up
the
final
cut
myself
i
mean
it
do
make
me
do
that
do
you
even
think
about
that
never
this
is
my
picture
just
business
if
it
a
choice
between
doing
what
i
got
ta
do
or
having
nicky
russo
chew
me
a
new
asshole
and
become
the
silent
partner
in
applecore
guess
what
it
gon
na
be
david
you
know
i
would
never
let
that
happen
i
walked
over
and
gave
him
the
sweetest
hug
i
knew
how
still
filled
with
joy
and
thanks
so
much
for
trying
to
get
us
a
theatrical
you
do
know
how
much
that
means
to
me
hey
do
try
the
charm
bit
on
me
i
serious
i
cut
you
a
weekend
slack
but
then
it
back
to
the
salt
mines
either
this
picture
in
the
can
inside
of
six
weeks
or
we
both
going
to
be
looking
for
new
employment
so
go
the
hell
up
there
do
whatever
it
is
you
going
to
do
and
then
get
this
damned
picture
finished
be
plenty
of
time
after
that
to
worry
about
our
next
project
with
luck
we
might
even
have
the
money
for
it
with
that
ultimatum
still
ringing
in
my
ears
i
took
my
leave
of
david
roth
and
headed
north
up
the
henry
hudson
parkway
my
life
was
getting
too
for
words
as
i
drove
i
tried
not
to
dwell
on
the
practical
aspects
of
what
was
coming
it
was
hard
to
imagine
what
tests
alex
goddard
could
perform
that
had
already
been
done
by
hannah
klein
just
thinking
back
over
that
dismal
sequence
made
me
feel
all
over
again
when
i
first
mentioned
i
was
thinking
about
trying
to
get
pregnant
she
looked
me
over
perhaps
mentally
calculating
my
age
and
my
prospects
and
then
made
a
light
suggestion
why
do
i
give
you
a
prescription
for
clomid
clomiphene
citrate
enhances
ovulation
and
it
might
be
a
good
idea
in
your
case
still
young
morgan
but
you
no
longer
in
the
first
blush
of
youth
i
took
it
for
six
months
but
nothing
happened
that
was
the
beginning
of
my
pregnancy
depression
by
that
time
she
decided
i
definitely
had
a
problem
so
she
began
what
she
called
an
infertility
workup
the
main
thing
was
to
check
my
fallopian
tubes
for
blockages
and
look
for
ovulatory
abnormalities
but
everything
turned
out
to
be
fine
depression
city
well
she
said
maybe
your
body
just
you
released
an
ovum
we
need
to
do
an
ultrasound
scan
to
make
doubly
sure
an
ovarian
follicle
has
ruptured
when
it
scheduled
to
and
dropped
an
egg
it
turned
out
however
that
all
those
hormonal
signals
were
working
just
fine
in
the
meantime
steve
and
i
were
doing
it
like
bunnies
and
still
no
pregnancy
okay
she
then
declared
the
problem
may
be
with
your
fallopian
tubes
after
all
time
to
test
for
abnormalities
this
is
not
going
to
be
fun
first
we
have
to
dilate
your
cervix
after
which
we
inject
a
dye
and
follow
it
with
as
it
moves
through
the
uterus
and
is
ejected
out
of
your
fallopian
tubes
we
know
right
away
if
there
any
kind
of
blockage
if
there
is
something
we
can
go
in
and
fix
it
sort
of
check
out
my
pipes
i
said
trying
to
come
to
grips
with
the
procedure
i
was
increasingly
sinking
into
despondency
she
did
it
all
and
for
a
while
she
suspected
there
might
be
some
kind
of
anatomical
problem
which
brought
us
to
the
next
escalation
of
invasiveness
we
got
to
go
in
and
take
a
look
at
everything
she
said
it
a
procedure
called
laparoscopy
i
have
to
make
a
small
incision
near
your
navel
and
insert
a
tiny
optical
device
in
your
case
i
want
to
combine
it
with
what
called
a
hysteroscopy
which
will
allow
me
to
see
directly
inside
your
uterus
for
polyps
and
fibroids
but
again
everything
looked
fine
i
began
to
wonder
what
had
happened
to
everybody
mother
warning
you
could
get
pregnant
just
letting
some
pimply
guy
put
his
hand
in
your
pants
prior
to
all
this
i
should
add
steve
had
provided
samples
of
sperm
to
be
tested
for
number
and
vigor
both
were
just
fine
then
toward
the
end
of
all
the
indignities
he
actually
paid
to
have
some
kind
of
test
performed
involving
a
hamster
egg
to
see
if
his
sperm
was
lively
enough
to
penetrate
it
no
wonder
he
finally
went
over
the
edge
now
i
was
reduced
to
alex
goddard
i
brought
a
complete
set
of
my
medical
test
records
as
ramala
had
requested
on
the
phone
i
also
brought
a
deep
curiosity
about
what
exactly
he
could
do
that
already
been
done
i
further
wondered
how
i
was
going
to
talk
steve
into
coming
back
long
enough
to
share
in
the
project
as
i
motored
up
the
driveway
to
quetzal
manor
i
told
myself
he
loved
me
still
wanted
a
baby
as
much
as
i
did
well
let
me
be
safe
and
say
almost
as
much
the
problem
was
he
was
so
demoralized
about
the
whole
thing
and
then
what
what
if
nothing
happened
i
started
to
park
my
car
where
i
had
the
last
time
then
noticed
the
place
actually
had
a
parking
lot
it
was
located
off
to
the
left
side
of
the
driveway
near
the
second
modern
building
and
was
more
or
less
hidden
in
amongst
the
trees
the
lot
was
filled
with
a
lot
of
but
inexpensive
cars
basic
transportation
and
it
seemed
a
better
bet
for
parking
the
front
lobby
which
had
been
empty
the
first
time
i
was
there
was
now
a
minimalist
reception
area
a
long
metal
desk
rolled
in
from
somewhere
i
had
the
odd
feeling
it
was
there
just
for
me
the
woman
behind
the
desk
introduced
herself
as
ramala
the
same
person
talked
to
twice
on
the
phone
she
looked
to
be
about
my
age
with
long
dark
hair
and
quick
asian
eyes
punctuated
by
a
professional
smile
she
knew
my
name
used
it
the
minute
she
saw
me
and
then
abruptly
handed
me
a
application
to
complete
it
not
just
a
formality
she
explained
businesslike
and
earnest
goddard
feels
it
essential
that
he
come
to
know
you
as
a
person
he
read
this
carefully
believe
me
she
ushered
me
to
a
chair
that
had
a
retractable
table
for
writing
then
gave
me
a
ballpoint
pen
the
document
turned
out
to
be
the
most
prying
nosy
thing
i
ever
filled
out
the
pages
demanded
what
amounted
to
a
mini
life
history
one
of
the
things
that
struck
me
as
most
strange
was
the
part
asking
for
a
employment
and
residential
history
if
you
moved
around
as
much
as
i
have
worked
freelance
a
lot
you
understand
how
difficult
it
can
be
to
reconstruct
all
those
dates
and
places
but
i
did
my
best
there
were
of
course
plenty
of
health
questions
too
one
page
even
asked
whether
there
was
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
about
my
own
birth
was
the
delivery
difficult
a
cesarean
a
breach
baby
it
was
as
noted
a
life
history
why
does
he
need
all
this
information
i
asked
finally
feeling
the
onset
of
carpal
tunnel
syndrome
in
my
right
wrist
i
brought
all
my
medical
records
ramala
gave
me
a
kindly
smile
full
of
sympathy
he
must
know
you
as
a
person
then
everything
is
possible
when
i
came
here
i
had
given
up
on
ever
having
a
child
but
i
surrendered
myself
to
him
and
now
my
husband
and
i
have
twin
boys
three
years
old
why
i
stayed
to
help
him
his
program
can
work
miracles
but
you
must
give
him
your
trust
well
i
thought
i
might
as
well
go
with
the
flow
and
see
where
it
leads
when
i
finished
the
form
she
took
it
back
along
with
the
pen
then
ushered
me
into
the
wide
central
courtyard
where
i
met
alex
goddard
the
first
time
he
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
but
in
the
bright
sunshine
there
was
a
line
of
about
twenty
women
from
late
twenties
to
early
forties
all
dressed
in
white
outfits
of
the
kind
you
see
in
judo
classes
doing
coordinated
tai
exercises
they
were
intent
their
eyes
fixed
on
the
fringes
of
infinity
these
must
be
some
of
his
acolytes
i
thought
the
ones
i
heard
in
their
nuns
cells
the
first
time
i
was
here
what
on
earth
does
all
this
orientalism
have
to
do
with
fertility
i
then
found
myself
wondering
i
studied
the
far
east
enough
to
do
penetrating
documentaries
about
it
and
i
still
ca
get
pregnant
i
took
one
look
at
them
none
of
them
looked
at
me
and
my
heart
went
out
they
were
so
sincere
so
sure
of
what
they
were
doing
for
somebody
who
always
questioning
everything
like
me
it
was
touching
and
maybe
a
little
daunting
too
without
a
word
ramala
led
me
past
them
and
on
to
an
entryway
at
the
far
end
of
the
courtyard
past
the
giant
dancing
shiva
the
door
was
huge
and
ornate
decorated
with
filigree
much
like
one
i
seen
in
a
mogul
palace
in
northern
india
definitely
she
pushed
open
the
door
without
ceremony
and
there
he
was
dressed
in
white
and
looking
for
all
the
world
like
the
miracle
worker
he
claimed
to
be
he
seemed
to
be
meditating
in
his
chair
but
the
moment
i
entered
his
deep
eyes
snapped
open
did
you
bring
your
records
he
asked
not
getting
up
while
i
was
producing
them
from
my
briefcase
ramala
discreetly
disappeared
please
have
a
seat
he
gestured
me
toward
a
wide
chair
the
room
was
a
sterile
baby
blue
nothing
to
see
no
diplomas
no
photos
nothing
except
for
another
smaller
bronze
statue
of
the
dancing
shiva
poised
on
a
table
i
also
noticed
that
his
own
flowing
hair
seemed
to
match
that
of
the
bronze
figure
yes
i
thought
i
was
right
that
who
he
thinks
he
is
and
he
has
complete
power
over
the
people
around
him
how
many
chances
do
you
get
to
do
a
documentary
about
somebody
like
this
i
should
have
brought
a
betacam
for
some
video
he
studied
my
test
records
as
a
jeweler
might
examine
a
diamond
his
serious
eyes
boring
in
as
he
flipped
through
the
pages
the
rest
of
his
face
however
betrayed
no
particular
interest
i
finally
felt
compelled
to
break
the
awkward
silence
as
you
can
see
i
had
every
test
known
to
science
and
none
of
them
found
anything
wrong
he
just
nodded
saying
nothing
and
kept
on
reading
after
a
long
awkward
silence
i
decided
to
try
and
open
things
up
a
bit
tell
me
do
you
have
any
children
of
your
own
the
question
seemed
to
be
one
he
did
get
asked
too
often
because
he
stopped
cold
all
those
who
come
here
are
my
children
he
replied
putting
aside
my
records
dismissively
finished
with
them
well
i
pointed
to
them
what
do
you
think
i
have
examined
you
yet
he
said
looking
up
and
smiling
indeed
beaming
with
confidence
nothing
in
those
records
tells
me
anything
about
what
may
be
your
problem
i
look
for
different
things
than
do
most
physicians
he
fiddled
with
something
beneath
his
desk
and
the
room
was
abruptly
filled
with
the
sound
of
a
hypnotic
drone
perhaps
its
frequency
matched
one
in
my
brain
because
i
instantly
felt
relaxed
and
full
of
hope
much
better
than
muzak
then
he
rose
and
came
over
is
he
going
to
do
my
exam
right
here
i
wondered
where
all
the
paraphernalia
the
humiliating
stirrups
standing
in
front
of
me
he
gently
placed
his
hands
on
my
heart
then
bent
over
and
seemed
to
be
listening
to
my
chest
his
touch
was
warm
then
cold
then
warm
but
the
overall
effect
was
to
send
a
sense
of
through
my
entire
body
you
not
breathing
normally
he
said
after
a
moment
of
unnerving
silence
i
feel
no
harmony
how
did
he
know
that
but
he
was
right
i
felt
the
way
i
had
the
first
time
i
tried
to
sit
in
zen
meditation
in
kyoto
as
then
my
body
was
relaxing
but
my
wayward
brain
was
still
coursing
i
try
i
said
attempting
to
go
along
what
i
really
was
feeling
was
the
overwhelming
sense
of
his
presence
drawing
me
to
him
next
he
moved
around
behind
me
and
cradled
my
head
in
his
hands
placing
his
long
fingertips
on
my
forehead
sort
of
the
same
way
done
when
i
was
standing
with
him
on
the
windy
heath
nursing
a
killer
cold
all
the
while
the
drone
seemed
to
be
increasing
to
a
piercing
overwhelming
volume
as
though
a
powerful
electrical
force
were
growing
in
the
room
sending
me
into
an
alpha
state
of
relaxation
what
are
you
doing
is
this
how
you
do
an
exam
for
the
medical
tests
you
had
showed
there
nothing
wrong
with
your
uterus
or
your
fallopian
tubes
nothing
that
should
inhibit
conception
there
no
need
to
pursue
that
any
further
but
the
mind
and
the
body
are
a
single
entity
that
must
be
harmonized
must
work
as
one
although
each
individual
has
different
energy
flows
i
think
my
regimen
here
could
be
very
helpful
to
you
already
i
can
tell
your
problem
is
a
trauma
that
has
negated
the
natural
condition
wherein
your
mind
and
body
work
in
unison
what
i
asked
he
did
answer
the
question
instead
he
began
massaging
my
temples
breathe
deeply
and
do
it
slowly
very
slowly
as
i
did
i
felt
a
kind
of
dizziness
gradually
coming
over
me
the
hypnotic
drone
seeming
to
take
over
my
consciousness
instead
of
growing
slower
my
breathing
was
actually
becoming
more
rapid
as
though
i
started
to
hyperventilate
but
i
no
longer
had
any
control
over
it
my
autonomic
nervous
system
had
been
handed
over
to
him
as
dizziness
and
a
sense
of
disorientation
settled
over
me
the
room
around
me
began
to
swirl
and
i
felt
my
conscious
mind
my
will
slipping
out
of
my
grasp
it
was
the
very
thing
i
vowed
not
to
let
happen
the
same
thing
had
occurred
once
before
after
i
broke
my
collarbone
in
the
pacific
surf
that
slammed
a
mexican
beach
south
of
puerto
villarta
when
a
kindly
mexican
doctor
was
later
binding
on
a
harness
to
immobilize
my
shoulder
the
pain
was
such
that
i
momentarily
passed
out
while
sitting
on
a
stool
in
his
office
i
did
fall
over
or
collapse
it
just
seemed
as
though
my
mind
fleeing
the
incredible
pain
drifted
away
in
a
haze
of
sensation
now
the
pastel
blue
walls
of
the
room
slowly
faded
to
white
and
then
i
was
somewhere
else
a
universe
away
surrounded
by
blank
nothingness
i
tried
to
focus
on
the
bronze
shiva
directly
across
but
the
ring
of
fire
around
him
had
become
actual
flames
the
only
reality
left
was
the
powerful
touch
of
alex
goddard
hands
and
a
drone
that
could
have
been
the
music
of
the
spheres
chapter
eight
sometime
thereafter
in
a
reverie
i
felt
myself
in
a
magical
forest
whose
lush
vines
reminded
me
of
kerala
in
india
it
was
a
verdant
hazy
paradise
another
eden
a
child
was
with
me
a
child
of
my
own
and
i
felt
jubilation
i
watched
the
child
as
she
grew
and
became
a
resplendent
orchid
but
with
childbearing
came
pain
and
i
seemed
to
be
feeling
that
pain
as
i
took
up
the
flower
and
held
it
joy
flowing
through
me
then
alex
goddard
drifted
into
my
dream
still
all
in
white
and
he
was
gentle
and
caring
as
he
again
moved
his
hands
over
me
leaving
numbness
in
their
wake
i
thought
i
heard
his
voice
talking
of
the
miracle
that
he
would
make
for
me
a
miracle
baby
a
beautiful
flower
of
a
child
i
asked
him
how
such
a
thing
would
happen
a
miracle
he
whispered
back
it
will
be
a
miracle
just
for
you
when
he
said
it
the
orchid
turned
into
the
silver
face
of
a
cat
a
vaguely
familiar
image
smiling
benignly
then
transmuted
back
into
a
blossom
then
he
drifted
out
of
my
dream
much
as
he
had
come
a
wisp
of
white
leaving
me
holding
the
gorgeous
flower
against
my
breasts
which
had
begun
to
swell
and
spill
out
milk
the
color
of
gold
a
wet
coolness
washed
across
my
face
and
as
i
faintly
heard
the
sounds
of
bach
clavier
glenn
gould
piano
notes
crisp
and
clear
i
opened
my
eyes
to
see
ramala
massaging
my
brow
with
a
damp
cloth
she
smiled
kindly
and
lovingly
as
she
saw
my
eyes
open
then
widen
with
astonishment
what
hey
how
you
doing
do
be
alarmed
he
taking
great
care
of
you
what
where
am
i
i
lifted
my
head
off
the
pillow
and
tried
to
look
around
i
half
expected
steve
to
be
there
but
of
course
he
was
you
here
at
quetzal
manor
she
reached
and
did
something
and
the
music
slowly
faded
away
do
worry
you
be
fine
i
think
the
doctor
was
trying
to
release
your
chi
and
when
he
did
it
was
too
strong
for
you
what
day
is
it
i
felt
completely
disoriented
my
bearings
gone
sunday
it
sunday
morning
she
reached
and
touched
my
brow
as
though
giving
me
a
blessing
like
it
okay
really
at
that
moment
alex
goddard
strolled
in
dressed
again
in
white
just
as
in
the
dream
i
thought
so
how
the
patient
he
walked
over
eyes
benign
and
caring
and
lifted
my
wrist
absently
taking
my
pulse
while
he
inserted
a
digital
thermometer
in
my
ear
for
a
flashback
moment
he
merged
into
then
emerged
from
my
dream
you
looking
fine
i
have
to
say
though
you
had
quite
a
time
yesterday
all
i
remember
is
passing
out
in
your
office
i
mumbled
glancing
around
at
the
gray
plastic
thermometer
and
that
strange
dream
you
telling
me
i
would
have
a
miracle
baby
you
had
an
unusual
reaction
he
went
on
you
remember
i
spoke
to
you
about
harmony
you
see
what
can
happen
when
i
redirect
the
flows
of
energy
chi
from
your
body
to
your
mind
he
smiled
and
settled
my
wrist
back
onto
the
bed
do
worry
i
have
a
lot
of
hope
for
you
you
going
to
do
fine
he
looked
satisfied
as
he
consulted
the
thermometer
then
jotted
down
my
temperature
on
a
chart
he
already
started
a
medical
record
i
thought
why
i
i
wondering
if
this
really
is
working
out
i
said
it
was
dawning
on
me
that
i
was
getting
into
alex
goddard
world
a
lot
deeper
and
a
lot
faster
than
i
expected
i
come
planning
to
be
an
observer
and
now
i
was
the
one
being
observed
that
was
exactly
not
how
intended
it
maybe
i
thought
if
i
back
off
and
make
a
new
run
i
can
keep
us
on
equal
footing
perhaps
i
ought
to
just
go
back
to
the
city
for
a
few
days
and
i
assumed
you
came
to
begin
the
program
he
looked
at
me
a
quick
sadness
flooding
his
eyes
you
struck
me
as
a
person
who
would
follow
through
i
need
to
think
this
over
i
really
feel
terrible
i
thought
trying
to
rise
up
what
did
he
do
to
me
maybe
i
just
not
right
for
your
the
idea
of
a
documentary
had
momentarily
retreated
far
into
the
depths
of
my
mind
on
the
contrary
he
smiled
we
shown
that
you
very
responsive
maybe
that
it
maybe
i
too
responsive
i
rose
and
slipped
my
feet
off
the
bed
the
motion
brought
a
piercing
pain
in
my
abdomen
ouch
what
i
felt
my
pelvis
only
to
find
it
was
very
sensitive
pulling
aside
my
bed
shift
i
gazed
in
disbelief
at
my
lower
abdomen
there
were
red
spots
just
above
my
pale
blue
panties
alex
goddard
modestly
averted
his
eyes
i
did
want
to
say
anything
he
explained
to
the
wall
above
my
head
but
you
were
in
pretty
delicate
shape
there
for
a
while
mild
convulsions
and
i
think
your
digestive
system
had
gone
into
shock
the
stomach
is
a
center
of
energy
because
it
constantly
active
so
i
gave
you
some
shots
of
muscle
relaxant
nothing
serious
it
an
unusual
treatment
but
found
it
works
it
modulates
the
energy
flows
i
also
took
a
blood
sample
for
some
tests
but
the
results
were
all
normal
he
then
asked
me
about
my
menstrual
cycle
exact
days
saying
he
wanted
to
make
sure
it
was
just
routine
cramps
the
seizure
you
had
passed
almost
as
soon
as
it
came
but
you
might
actually
have
been
hallucinating
a
bit
you
had
a
slight
fever
all
night
well
something
like
that
had
happened
to
me
years
ago
in
rural
japan
when
i
stupidly
ate
some
unwashed
greens
and
my
stomach
went
into
shock
at
one
point
a
local
doctor
chinese
was
trying
acupuncture
which
also
left
me
sore
nothing
to
be
worried
about
he
continued
but
if
you
the
least
bit
concerned
maybe
we
ought
to
do
a
quick
sonogram
take
a
sound
picture
ease
your
mind
that
everything
okay
that
does
really
seem
necessary
i
said
for
a
clinic
specializing
in
energy
flows
and
programs
there
was
a
lot
of
modern
equipment
odd
wo
do
a
bit
of
harm
he
nodded
at
ramala
who
also
seemed
to
think
it
was
a
good
idea
come
on
help
me
walk
her
down
to
the
lab
he
turned
back
it
totally
noninvasive
you
see
for
yourself
that
you
fine
before
i
could
protest
i
found
myself
walking
with
some
dizziness
down
the
hallway
this
part
of
quetzal
manor
which
i
had
not
seen
before
was
a
sterile
clinic
i
realized
i
was
in
a
different
building
from
the
old
convent
probably
the
new
one
noticed
across
the
parking
lot
the
one
he
had
bothered
to
mention
that
first
day
but
all
i
could
focus
on
were
the
blue
walls
and
the
new
white
tiles
of
the
floor
the
sonogram
was
as
he
described
it
quick
and
noninvasive
he
rubbed
the
ultrasound
wand
over
my
abdomen
watching
the
picture
on
a
crt
screen
which
showed
my
insides
a
jumble
of
organs
that
he
seemed
to
find
extremely
informative
look
he
pointed
those
lines
there
are
your
fallopian
tubes
and
that
your
uterus
he
pushed
a
button
to
record
a
digital
image
seems
like
whatever
was
upsetting
your
stomach
is
gone
obviously
nothing
wrong
here
good
i
said
because
i
really
need
to
take
a
few
days
and
think
this
over
you
should
stay
he
said
reaching
to
touch
my
hand
i
think
the
worst
is
well
behind
us
from
here
on
we
can
work
together
in
fact
what
i
actually
wish
you
would
do
is
come
with
me
to
my
clinic
in
central
america
it
truly
a
place
of
miracles
i
assumed
he
was
referring
to
the
special
place
he
mentioned
during
our
first
interview
if
quetzal
manor
was
on
the
exotic
side
i
thought
what
must
that
place
be
like
a
documentary
that
took
in
the
totality
of
who
and
what
he
was
could
be
in
fact
he
went
on
i
just
learned
i
have
to
be
going
there
later
today
a
quick
trip
to
catch
up
on
some
things
so
this
would
be
an
ideal
time
for
you
to
come
we
could
go
together
well
i
thought
i
love
to
see
what
else
he
up
to
but
this
whole
scene
is
getting
out
of
control
when
i
first
met
alex
goddard
we
had
a
power
balance
but
now
he
definitely
calling
the
shots
i
do
think
i
ready
for
that
kind
of
commitment
yet
as
you
wish
he
smiled
with
understanding
but
let
me
just
say
this
it
not
going
to
be
easy
but
nothing
i
seen
so
far
suggests
there
any
physical
reason
why
you
ca
have
a
child
we
just
need
to
get
you
in
touch
with
the
energy
centers
in
your
body
rightness
flows
from
that
you
really
think
so
in
spite
of
myself
i
felt
my
hopes
rising
even
though
i
had
definite
mixed
feelings
about
his
kind
of
holistic
medicine
i
virtually
certain
but
whether
you
want
to
continue
with
the
program
or
not
is
a
decision
you
have
to
make
for
yourself
well
maybe
when
i
feeling
better
we
can
talk
some
more
about
it
i
definitely
needed
to
reconsider
my
game
plan
for
now
i
think
better
just
get
my
things
and
as
you
wish
he
sighed
your
clothes
are
in
your
room
there
a
closet
in
the
corner
by
the
window
i
shot
a
glance
at
him
does
my
blue
cross
cover
this
on
the
house
a
dismissive
wave
of
his
hand
and
another
kindly
smile
i
was
still
feeling
shaky
as
i
moved
back
down
the
vacant
hallway
but
i
refused
to
let
either
of
them
help
me
instead
i
left
him
to
oversee
ramala
as
she
shut
down
the
equipment
oddly
the
place
still
seemed
vacant
except
for
me
though
there
was
a
large
white
door
that
appeared
to
lead
to
another
wing
what
was
in
there
i
wondered
the
questions
kept
piling
up
it
soon
turned
out
i
was
wrong
about
the
clinic
being
empty
when
i
reached
the
door
to
the
room
where
i
been
i
thought
i
heard
a
shuffling
sound
inside
i
pushed
it
open
gingerly
and
saw
the
room
was
dark
it
had
been
when
i
left
the
shuffling
noise
i
realized
it
was
somebody
closing
the
venetian
blinds
immediately
stopped
i
began
feeling
along
the
wall
for
the
light
switch
please
leave
it
off
said
a
spacey
female
voice
it
nice
when
dark
as
my
eyes
became
accustomed
to
the
eerie
i
finally
made
out
a
figure
it
was
a
short
woman
childlike
but
probably
what
are
you
doing
in
here
i
just
wanted
to
like
be
with
you
she
done
her
dark
hair
in
multiple
braids
with
a
red
glass
bead
at
the
end
of
each
special
we
all
know
it
that
why
he
brought
you
over
here
to
this
building
to
be
near
them
what
do
you
mean
i
asked
heading
for
the
closet
and
my
black
jeans
then
i
wondered
near
who
now
she
was
reaching
into
a
fanny
pack
she
had
around
her
waist
and
taking
out
a
baggie
filled
with
plastic
vials
these
are
herbs
started
growing
here
i
picked
them
for
you
if
you
slow
down
i
said
lifting
my
jeans
off
the
hanger
and
starting
to
struggle
into
them
finally
i
took
the
baggie
moved
to
the
window
and
tilted
up
the
blind
inside
it
were
clear
plastic
medicine
bottles
containing
various
gray
and
green
powders
and
flakes
my
god
what
she
trying
to
give
me
and
why
listen
she
went
on
insistent
take
those
put
two
teaspoons
of
each
in
water
you
boiled
and
drink
it
every
day
for
a
week
make
you
strong
then
you
be
hey
i
going
to
be
just
fine
really
i
set
them
aside
and
studied
her
still
a
ghostlike
figure
in
the
semi
dark
there
was
a
wildness
in
her
eyes
that
was
very
disturbing
at
that
moment
alex
goddard
appeared
in
the
doorway
he
clicked
on
the
light
looking
puzzled
could
find
the
switch
then
he
glanced
around
tara
did
you
get
lost
i
thought
you
were
doing
your
meditation
it
sunday
afterwards
though
you
can
weed
the
north
herb
boxes
if
you
want
she
nodded
silently
then
grabbed
the
baggie
and
glided
out
her
brown
eyes
filled
with
both
reverence
and
what
seemed
like
fear
who
was
that
i
asked
staring
after
her
feeling
unsettled
by
the
whole
experience
she
seemed
pretty
intense
tara
been
pretty
intense
for
some
time
perhaps
for
much
of
her
life
he
declared
with
a
note
of
sadness
as
he
closed
the
door
behind
her
i
not
been
able
to
do
anything
for
her
but
i
let
her
stay
on
here
since
she
has
nowhere
else
to
go
she
loves
the
gardens
so
i
let
her
work
out
there
it
seems
to
improve
her
a
kind
of
benign
therapy
her
own
natural
path
toward
centering
well
i
thought
she
certainly
could
use
some
centering
look
goddard
let
me
get
my
things
and
then
i
got
to
be
going
i
ca
start
on
anything
right
now
not
the
way
i
feeling
and
visiting
your
other
clinic
is
completely
out
of
the
question
at
least
for
the
moment
i
have
great
hopes
for
you
he
said
again
placing
a
gentle
hand
on
my
shoulder
i
sorry
we
ca
begin
to
work
together
immediately
but
do
promise
me
you
reconsider
and
come
back
soon
maybe
when
i
feeling
better
keep
the
option
open
i
told
myself
for
a
lot
of
reasons
in
that
case
ramala
can
show
you
out
i
arranged
for
her
to
give
you
some
herbal
extracts
from
the
rain
forest
that
could
well
start
you
on
the
road
to
motherhood
whether
you
decide
to
come
back
or
not
i
know
they
help
you
and
he
was
gone
a
wisp
of
white
moving
out
the
doorway
it
was
only
then
that
i
realized
i
again
been
too
preoccupied
to
ask
him
about
kevin
and
rachel
the
beautiful
siblings
born
six
months
apart
instead
all
i
had
left
was
a
memory
of
those
penetrating
eyes
and
the
power
the
absolute
power
chapter
nine
after
giving
me
a
small
bag
with
two
bottles
ramala
led
me
out
and
i
discovered
i
really
in
a
different
building
the
one
situated
across
the
parking
lot
and
all
but
hidden
in
the
trees
it
was
new
and
probably
larger
than
it
appeared
from
the
front
again
i
wondered
what
went
on
in
there
since
it
seemed
so
empty
check
it
out
and
soon
i
told
myself
as
i
slipped
my
key
into
the
ignition
you
got
to
find
out
a
lot
more
about
this
place
on
the
drive
back
to
the
city
my
main
thought
was
that
i
lost
a
day
of
my
life
it
just
sort
of
slipped
away
but
that
was
all
i
also
began
to
meditate
on
the
fact
that
alex
goddard
could
have
an
immense
influence
over
my
body
or
was
it
my
mind
with
a
simple
touch
give
him
his
due
he
could
definitely
make
things
happen
first
my
cold
and
now
this
perhaps
he
could
give
me
a
child
if
i
got
centered
whatever
that
meant
but
why
should
i
trust
him
and
there
was
another
problem
for
a
baby
i
need
steve
the
man
i
loved
the
guy
who
promised
to
be
with
me
through
thick
and
thin
did
he
really
mean
it
he
have
to
fly
in
which
meant
a
serious
piece
of
change
for
the
airfare
finally
could
he
face
another
chance
of
failure
my
spirits
sank
at
the
prospect
of
having
to
ask
him
were
we
both
just
going
to
be
humiliated
one
more
time
he
made
his
home
base
in
belize
that
little
rhode
island
of
a
country
abutting
big
bad
guatemala
he
liked
the
fact
they
used
english
more
or
less
as
the
official
language
and
they
had
gotten
around
to
murdering
two
hundred
thousand
maya
the
way
guatemala
had
in
a
romantic
moment
i
programmed
his
belize
hotel
number
into
the
memory
of
my
cell
phone
the
telephones
down
there
are
amazingly
good
maybe
the
brit
legacy
though
i
never
actually
tried
it
i
called
him
from
home
about
half
a
dozen
times
but
he
was
rarely
there
well
i
thought
the
time
has
come
maybe
it
was
the
sensual
feelings
released
by
all
the
chi
flowing
around
but
for
some
reason
i
found
myself
feeling
very
lonely
he
had
called
recently
though
it
took
ten
rings
but
eventually
the
hotel
answered
a
moment
later
they
were
trying
his
room
i
guess
i
was
half
afraid
a
woman
might
pick
up
but
it
was
him
and
there
were
no
hushed
tones
or
cryptic
monosyllables
i
heaved
a
minor
sigh
of
reassurance
baby
i
ca
believe
it
you
he
declared
i
actually
been
trying
to
reach
you
for
a
day
now
you
finally
get
around
to
missing
me
it
was
so
good
to
hear
his
voice
full
of
life
and
energy
all
the
time
never
did
you
just
got
to
understand
it
crazy
down
here
all
last
week
i
was
in
honduras
haggling
over
permits
do
ask
he
paused
so
when
are
you
coming
down
they
got
a
national
park
here
that
a
pure
chunk
of
rain
forest
jaguars
everywhere
he
laughed
but
forget
that
if
you
come
down
never
get
out
of
the
hotel
just
room
service
all
day
no
immediate
plans
i
said
immediately
wondering
how
i
could
swing
it
but
you
never
know
i
was
entirely
sure
how
to
approach
steve
anymore
there
was
something
about
the
abrupt
way
he
took
off
that
left
things
up
in
the
air
a
tiny
sliver
of
uneasiness
was
slipping
into
my
trust
the
camel
nose
under
the
tent
first
the
good
news
i
declared
david
talking
to
orion
about
a
theatrical
release
for
steve
knew
how
deeply
i
longed
for
a
theatrical
it
would
be
my
first
and
he
enthused
appropriately
but
he
also
knew
i
would
call
him
early
sunday
morning
just
to
tell
him
that
there
was
only
one
other
thing
that
would
inspire
such
an
unsocialized
act
uh
should
i
be
asking
how
the
other
baby
project
is
going
he
said
for
a
moment
i
was
sure
what
to
say
since
i
did
really
even
know
myself
still
a
work
in
progress
i
said
finally
then
honey
i
just
been
to
see
a
doctor
who
well
he
a
little
unconventional
and
but
everything
else
has
failed
whereupon
i
gave
him
a
quick
summary
of
what
i
just
been
through
at
quetzal
manor
so
are
you
going
to
go
back
eventually
he
sounded
uneasy
for
the
full
he
had
a
way
of
zeroing
in
on
essentials
the
truth
was
my
baby
hopes
and
my
sense
of
were
at
war
with
each
other
morgy
are
you
there
i
here
and
i
guess
the
answer
is
i
still
trying
to
decide
like
i
said
he
into
eastern
medicine
and
native
american
i
not
sure
what
but
if
i
need
you
are
you
still
in
the
project
what
do
you
mean
darlin
do
play
dumb
you
know
exactly
what
i
mean
could
you
come
back
if
i
needed
you
really
needed
you
there
was
a
long
pause
wherein
the
milliseconds
dragged
by
like
hours
trees
were
gliding
past
throwing
shadows
on
my
windshield
and
i
still
felt
vaguely
dizzy
i
also
had
a
residual
ache
in
my
abdomen
where
alex
goddard
had
given
me
those
damned
shots
why
was
i
even
considering
going
back
finally
you
not
making
this
easy
you
know
down
here
without
our
project
on
the
front
burner
every
day
i
been
reassessing
well
a
lot
of
things
if
we
had
a
baby
it
would
turn
our
lives
upside
down
i
mean
it
not
like
we
just
bought
a
sheepdog
and
chipped
in
on
the
grooming
this
is
a
human
life
we
talking
about
are
we
really
prepared
to
do
justice
to
a
child
there
it
was
i
did
know
whether
i
wanted
to
burst
into
tears
or
strangle
the
man
well
why
do
you
just
think
about
it
i
told
him
this
sound
like
a
conversation
we
should
be
having
on
a
cell
phone
blast
him
if
that
the
way
you
feel
now
then
i
might
just
have
a
baby
on
my
own
how
i
was
sure
i
been
so
certain
we
were
a
couple
not
given
it
any
real
thought
or
then
again
i
might
just
go
ahead
and
adopt
with
or
without
you
look
i
not
saying
i
wo
do
it
i
just
saying
it
not
a
trivial
thing
he
paused
so
where
does
that
leave
us
translation
second
thoughts
i
do
know
where
that
leaves
us
steve
in
the
shit
i
guess
but
i
still
like
to
know
if
i
can
count
on
you
or
am
i
going
to
have
to
go
to
a
sperm
bank
or
something
jesus
let
me
think
about
this
okay
do
i
have
to
answer
you
now
no
but
i
not
going
to
wait
forever
either
all
right
then
he
paused
morgy
i
miss
you
i
really
do
i
just
need
some
time
to
think
about
our
next
step
are
you
sure
you
okay
you
sound
a
little
out
of
it
thanks
for
asking
i
just
got
a
lot
on
my
mind
turmoil
dismay
and
hope
all
tossed
together
that
was
what
i
had
on
my
mind
i
really
did
need
mixed
signals
from
steve
at
the
moment
a
few
more
awkward
pleasantries
and
i
clicked
off
the
phone
wiped
the
streaks
from
my
cheeks
and
abruptly
sensed
alex
goddard
face
floating
through
my
psyche
why
was
that
then
i
looked
down
at
the
bottles
on
the
seat
beside
me
the
herbal
extracts
ramala
had
given
me
on
the
way
out
what
i
wondered
should
i
do
about
them
for
that
matter
what
were
they
anyway
and
what
did
they
have
to
do
with
centering
if
i
started
on
his
homeopathic
treatments
what
would
i
be
getting
into
then
i
lectured
myself
never
take
something
when
you
do
know
what
it
is
hannah
klein
that
who
i
should
ask
i
was
so
focused
i
pushed
the
number
i
had
stored
for
her
in
my
phone
memory
before
i
remembered
it
was
sunday
instead
of
getting
her
office
i
got
an
answering
service
do
you
want
to
leave
the
doctor
a
message
a
voice
enquired
without
thinking
i
heard
myself
declaring
no
this
is
an
emergency
what
am
i
saying
i
asked
myself
but
before
i
could
take
it
back
hannah
was
on
the
line
i
know
how
intruded
on
i
feel
when
an
actor
calls
me
at
home
on
sunday
to
bitch
better
make
this
good
i
told
myself
i
was
at
an
infertility
clinic
yesterday
and
passed
out
i
began
and
now
i
have
some
herbs
to
take
but
i
well
i
not
sure
about
them
what
she
asked
there
was
no
reprimand
for
calling
her
on
sunday
morning
when
i
told
her
about
alex
goddard
she
said
little
but
she
did
not
sound
impressed
looming
there
between
us
like
the
dead
elephant
on
the
living
room
floor
was
the
fact
that
she
specifically
warned
me
not
to
go
near
him
and
after
what
had
just
happened
there
was
a
good
case
she
might
be
right
can
i
buy
you
brunch
i
finally
asked
hoping
to
lure
her
back
onto
my
case
i
really
like
to
show
you
these
herbs
he
gave
me
and
get
your
opinion
i
was
just
headed
out
to
zabar
to
get
something
she
said
somewhat
icily
well
i
suppose
she
thought
she
had
good
reason
i
get
some
bagels
and
meet
you
at
my
office
sunday
traffic
on
upper
broadway
was
light
and
i
lucked
out
and
found
a
parking
space
roughly
two
blocks
from
her
building
it
was
one
of
the
professional
types
with
a
single
small
elevator
and
no
doorman
when
i
got
there
the
lobby
was
empty
her
suite
was
on
the
third
floor
and
i
rang
the
bell
before
i
realized
the
door
was
open
she
was
back
in
her
office
behind
the
reception
area
taking
off
her
coat
when
i
marched
in
while
she
was
unwrapping
her
sesame
bagels
smoked
sturgeon
and
cream
cheese
with
chives
she
got
an
earful
my
feeling
was
i
better
talk
fast
and
i
did
i
told
her
everything
i
could
think
of
about
what
had
happened
to
me
at
quetzal
manor
i
did
expect
her
to
make
sense
of
it
from
my
secondhand
account
but
i
wanted
to
set
the
background
for
my
next
move
when
i
was
leaving
his
assistant
gave
me
these
two
bottles
of
she
said
they
special
herbal
extracts
he
makes
from
plants
in
the
rain
forest
do
you
think
i
ought
to
take
them
i
suspected
i
already
knew
the
answer
given
her
previously
voiced
views
on
alex
goddard
i
doubted
she
would
endorse
any
potions
he
might
dispense
but
plant
medicine
has
a
long
history
at
least
she
might
know
if
they
presented
any
real
danger
she
was
schmearing
cream
cheese
on
the
bagels
but
she
put
down
the
plastic
knife
took
the
two
bottles
and
examined
them
skeptically
these
are
not
extracts
she
declared
giving
her
first
analysis
before
even
opening
them
they
both
manufactured
drugs
the
have
names
on
them
it
a
latin
american
pharmaceutical
company
then
she
opened
the
first
bottle
took
out
one
of
the
caps
crushed
it
between
her
fingers
and
sniffed
just
what
i
thought
then
she
touched
a
pinch
of
the
white
powder
to
her
tongue
right
she
made
a
face
and
wiped
her
tongue
with
a
tissue
except
it
much
stronger
than
the
usual
version
i
can
tell
you
right
now
that
this
drug
in
this
potency
is
illegal
in
the
what
was
it
i
wondered
cocaine
and
how
could
she
tell
its
potency
with
just
a
taste
then
i
reminded
myself
why
i
come
to
her
in
the
first
place
she
been
around
the
track
many
many
times
it
gonadotropin
she
said
glaring
at
me
like
you
damned
fool
i
virtually
certain
the
trade
name
here
in
the
is
pergonal
though
that
not
what
this
is
this
is
a
much
stronger
concoction
and
i
can
see
some
impurities
she
settled
the
bottle
onto
her
desk
with
what
seemed
almost
a
shudder
this
is
the
pharmaceutical
equivalent
of
moonshine
what
is
it
what
it
supposed
it
do
jesus
i
thought
what
he
giving
me
it
a
hormone
extracted
from
the
urine
of
menopausal
women
it
triggers
a
greater
than
normal
egg
production
and
release
sometimes
prescribed
together
with
lupron
which
causes
your
body
to
release
a
similar
hormone
look
if
you
want
to
try
pergonal
the
real
version
i
write
you
a
prescription
though
i
honestly
do
think
it
going
to
do
you
the
slightest
bit
of
good
i
could
believe
what
i
was
hearing
i
almost
been
considering
giving
alex
goddard
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
at
least
till
i
found
out
more
about
him
and
now
he
hands
me
this
now
we
both
were
looking
at
the
other
bottle
what
do
you
think
that
is
i
asked
pointing
she
broke
the
plastic
seal
opened
it
and
looked
in
it
too
was
a
white
powder
sealed
in
and
she
gave
one
a
sniff
then
the
taste
test
i
have
no
idea
she
set
the
bottle
back
on
her
desk
and
i
stared
at
it
terrified
of
what
it
might
be
finally
i
got
up
my
courage
and
reached
for
it
a
white
sticker
had
been
wrapped
around
it
with
directions
for
taking
whatever
it
was
written
on
it
then
i
happened
to
notice
that
one
corner
showed
the
edge
of
another
label
one
beneath
the
first
one
i
lifted
a
letter
opener
off
her
desk
and
managed
to
get
it
under
the
outer
label
with
a
little
scraping
and
tugging
i
got
it
off
does
this
mean
anything
to
you
i
asked
her
handing
it
back
in
spanish
but
the
contents
seem
to
be
hmg
massone
i
do
believe
it
she
said
taking
the
bottle
as
though
lifting
a
cobra
i
even
got
the
distinct
feeling
she
did
want
to
leave
any
fingerprints
on
it
that
an
even
more
powerful
drug
to
stimulate
ovarian
follicles
and
induce
superovulation
it
highly
illegal
in
this
country
anybody
who
gives
these
drugs
in
combination
to
a
patient
is
flirting
with
an
ethics
charge
or
worse
i
think
i
gasped
what
was
he
trying
to
put
into
my
body
she
settled
the
bottle
back
on
the
desk
her
eyes
growing
narrow
since
you
say
his
or
assistant
or
whatever
she
was
gave
you
this
i
suppose
there
always
the
chance
she
made
an
innocent
mistake
but
still
what
he
doing
with
this
stuff
at
all
they
manufacture
it
down
in
mexico
and
also
i
heard
somewhere
in
central
america
but
it
not
approved
in
the
anybody
who
dispenses
this
to
a
patient
is
putting
their
license
at
risk
she
paused
to
give
me
one
of
those
looks
assuming
alex
goddard
even
has
a
medical
license
these
medicine
types
sometimes
claim
they
answer
to
a
higher
power
they
by
god
i
do
for
a
minute
think
it
was
an
mistake
i
was
beginning
to
feel
terribly
betrayed
and
violated
i
also
was
getting
mad
as
hell
my
fingertips
tingling
but
why
would
he
give
me
these
drugs
at
all
did
he
somehow
i
think
you
better
ask
him
she
said
passing
me
a
bagel
piled
high
with
cream
cheese
and
sturgeon
she
bit
into
her
own
bagel
and
for
a
while
we
both
just
chewed
in
silence
i
however
had
just
lost
all
my
appetite
alex
goddard
who
might
well
be
my
last
chance
for
a
baby
had
just
dispensed
massive
doses
of
illegal
drugs
to
me
which
my
longtime
was
warning
me
were
both
unnecessary
and
unethical
what
do
you
think
i
should
do
i
asked
finally
breaking
the
silence
but
barely
able
to
get
my
voice
out
she
did
say
anything
she
finished
her
bagel
and
now
she
begun
wrapping
up
the
container
of
cream
cheese
folding
the
wax
paper
back
over
the
remaining
sturgeon
i
thought
her
silent
treatment
was
her
way
of
telling
me
my
brunch
consultation
was
over
she
clearly
was
exasperated
with
me
let
me
tell
you
a
story
she
said
finally
as
she
carefully
began
putting
the
leftover
sturgeon
back
into
the
zabar
bag
when
i
was
eight
years
old
all
the
jews
in
our
polish
ghetto
were
starving
because
the
nazis
refused
to
give
us
food
stamps
so
my
father
bribed
a
nazi
officer
to
let
him
go
out
into
the
countryside
to
try
to
buy
some
eggs
and
flour
anything
just
so
we
could
eat
the
farmer
came
that
saturday
morning
in
a
wagon
to
pick
up
my
father
at
the
last
minute
i
asked
to
go
with
him
and
he
let
me
that
night
the
nazis
liquidated
our
entire
ghetto
almost
five
thousand
people
no
one
else
in
my
family
survived
not
my
mother
not
my
two
sisters
not
anyone
her
voice
had
become
totally
dispassionate
as
though
repression
of
the
horror
was
the
only
way
a
sane
person
could
deal
with
it
she
could
just
as
easily
have
been
describing
a
country
outing
as
she
continued
i
did
notice
however
that
her
east
european
accent
had
suddenly
become
very
prominent
as
though
she
was
returning
there
in
her
thoughts
when
we
learned
what
had
happened
my
father
asked
the
farmer
we
were
visiting
to
go
to
a
certain
rural
doctor
we
knew
and
beg
him
to
give
us
some
poison
so
we
could
commit
suicide
before
the
nazis
got
us
too
the
doctor
however
told
him
he
had
only
enough
poison
for
his
own
family
he
did
however
give
him
a
prescription
for
us
but
when
my
father
begged
that
farmer
to
go
to
a
pharmacy
and
get
the
poison
he
and
his
entire
family
refused
instead
they
hid
us
in
their
barn
for
over
a
year
even
though
they
knew
it
meant
a
firing
squad
if
the
nazis
found
us
she
glared
at
me
do
you
understand
what
i
saying
they
told
us
that
if
we
wanted
to
do
something
foolish
because
we
were
desperate
we
would
have
to
do
it
without
their
help
it
was
the
first
time
i
ever
knew
her
real
story
i
was
stunned
what
exactly
are
you
driving
at
i
think
i
already
knew
the
long
trusting
relationship
we
shared
was
now
teetering
on
the
brink
by
going
to
see
alex
goddard
even
if
it
was
partly
a
research
trip
to
check
him
out
i
had
disappointed
her
terribly
she
lost
respect
for
me
she
thought
i
was
desperate
and
about
to
embark
on
something
foolish
i
saying
do
whatever
you
want
she
got
up
and
lifted
her
coat
off
the
corner
rack
but
get
those
drugs
out
of
here
i
do
want
them
anywhere
near
this
office
i
tried
everything
legal
there
was
to
get
you
pregnant
if
that
was
good
enough
for
you
and
now
you
want
to
go
to
some
quack
that
your
affair
let
me
just
warn
you
that
combining
gonadotropin
and
hmg
massone
at
these
dosages
is
like
putting
your
ovaries
on
steroids
you
get
massive
egg
production
for
a
couple
of
cycles
but
the
damage
could
be
severe
i
strongly
advise
you
against
it
but
if
you
insist
and
then
start
having
complications
i
would
appreciate
not
being
involved
translation
if
you
start
fooling
around
with
alex
goddard
do
ever
come
back
it
felt
like
a
dagger
in
my
chest
what
was
i
going
to
do
one
thought
okay
so
these
drugs
are
the
way
but
you
could
help
me
get
pregnant
all
i
did
was
spend
twenty
thousand
dollars
on
futile
procedures
not
to
mention
the
heartbreak
you
know
i
said
finally
maybe
a
little
sharply
i
think
we
ought
to
be
working
together
not
at
you
welcome
to
think
what
you
like
she
bristled
but
i
have
to
tell
you
i
do
appreciate
your
tone
i
guess
i
really
ticked
her
off
and
it
hurt
to
do
it
then
finally
her
own
rejection
of
me
was
sinking
in
so
that
it
you
telling
me
if
i
try
anything
except
exactly
what
you
want
me
to
then
just
do
ever
come
back
i
said
all
i
intend
to
she
was
resolutely
ushering
me
toward
the
door
her
eyes
abruptly
blank
well
i
told
myself
going
from
anger
to
despair
then
back
to
anger
whatever
else
i
might
think
about
alex
goddard
at
least
he
kick
people
out
because
of
their
problems
even
a
sad
soul
like
tara
still
what
about
these
illegal
drugs
there
i
was
caught
in
the
middle
between
an
honorable
woman
who
had
failed
and
alex
goddard
who
just
lived
up
to
my
worst
suspicions
heading
down
in
the
elevator
alone
i
could
still
hear
hannah
klein
rejection
and
warning
ringing
in
my
ears
maybe
she
had
just
confirmed
that
still
small
voice
of
rationality
lecturing
me
from
the
back
of
my
mind
i
marched
out
onto
the
empty
sunday
streets
of
upper
broadway
and
when
i
got
to
the
corner
i
stood
for
a
long
moment
looking
up
at
the
pitiless
blue
of
the
sky
the
sun
was
there
but
in
my
soul
i
felt
all
the
light
was
gone
finally
i
opened
the
first
bottle
and
then
one
by
one
i
began
taking
out
the
and
dropping
them
into
the
rainwater
grate
there
at
my
feet
watching
them
bounce
like
the
metal
sphere
in
an
old
pinball
machine
before
disappearing
into
the
darkness
below
when
both
bottles
were
empty
i
tossed
them
into
the
wire
trash
basket
i
been
standing
next
to
the
next
time
i
saw
alex
goddard
he
was
going
to
have
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
explaining
to
do
beginning
with
why
he
given
me
a
glimmer
of
hope
only
to
then
cruelly
snatch
it
back
i
found
myself
hating
him
with
all
my
being
chapter
ten
i
headed
on
back
downtown
planning
to
take
a
bath
change
clothes
and
then
recalibrate
my
game
plan
maybe
i
thought
i
ought
to
just
go
up
to
the
editing
room
at
applecore
try
some
rote
work
to
help
tranquilize
my
thoughts
but
first
things
first
about
halfway
there
at
street
i
pulled
over
and
by
a
korean
deli
and
surveyed
the
flowers
they
had
out
front
an
array
of
multicolored
blooms
that
virtually
blocked
entry
to
the
doorway
of
the
tiny
grocery
azaleas
chrysanthemums
but
i
wanted
the
pink
roses
at
ten
dollars
a
bunch
they
seemed
the
right
touch
i
dug
out
a
twenty
and
picked
two
still
standing
on
the
street
i
pulled
them
to
me
and
inhaled
deeply
as
far
back
as
i
could
remember
i
always
loved
the
scent
of
roses
i
never
really
thought
myself
pretty
the
hair
notwithstanding
but
just
having
roses
around
somehow
made
me
feel
that
way
i
wanted
to
be
engulfed
in
them
especially
any
time
confusion
threatened
to
get
the
upper
hand
five
minutes
later
and
i
was
at
street
i
arrived
my
refuge
my
cocoon
time
to
collapse
into
a
hot
bath
wonder
why
alex
goddard
had
given
me
illegal
drugs
and
contemplate
roses
i
was
looking
for
a
parking
space
when
my
cell
phone
rang
no
bother
i
told
myself
enough
intrusion
for
one
day
then
i
remembered
i
sprung
for
the
feature
and
i
glanced
down
at
the
little
liquid
crystal
slot
it
was
a
number
i
happened
to
know
lou
place
downtown
one
eye
still
on
the
street
i
reached
over
and
picked
it
up
finally
got
you
he
boomed
where
the
heck
are
you
i
just
got
home
from
yeah
i
know
where
you
been
dave
told
me
he
paused
as
though
he
was
holding
off
on
some
important
announcement
hang
on
a
sec
somebody
here
might
like
to
speak
to
you
i
thought
about
lou
makeshift
digs
lots
of
heirloom
family
furniture
he
lugged
along
with
him
sarah
and
i
used
to
play
on
the
couch
and
it
still
had
a
dim
mauve
stain
where
i
once
dumped
a
glass
of
grape
on
her
head
when
she
was
six
whatever
else
definitely
not
a
soho
look
then
i
heard
a
whispery
voice
hi
morgy
it
was
a
tentative
utterance
i
heard
only
once
before
when
she
was
waking
up
after
falling
off
a
playground
swing
she
been
knocked
out
cold
for
a
moment
and
i
been
frantic
wetting
a
handkerchief
in
the
nearby
fountain
and
desperately
rubbing
it
over
her
face
when
she
came
to
she
gazed
up
into
my
eyes
and
greeted
me
as
though
we
just
met
my
god
before
i
could
recover
and
say
anything
lou
came
back
on
practicing
eating
soup
and
we
trying
to
do
a
little
talking
why
do
you
come
on
down
she
asked
about
you
earlier
this
morning
said
morgy
lou
this
is
incredible
you
got
ta
believe
in
miracles
right
just
come
on
down
is
she
god
you
got
it
my
hopes
went
into
orbit
as
i
clicked
off
the
phone
and
revved
my
engine
i
could
have
swamped
him
with
a
lot
of
questions
then
and
there
but
i
immediately
decided
i
wanted
to
see
her
first
with
my
own
eyes
i
still
could
quite
believe
it
was
true
on
the
other
hand
a
weekend
partial
recovery
was
not
totally
beyond
the
realm
of
medical
possibility
with
a
coma
so
little
is
understood
that
possible
lou
was
right
this
was
definitely
a
weekend
of
the
unexpected
i
been
close
to
the
deaths
of
people
near
to
me
both
my
parents
for
starters
but
i
never
been
close
to
the
restoration
of
life
hard
to
explain
the
rush
of
joy
when
you
think
somebody
is
gone
for
good
and
then
they
pop
up
again
like
they
never
been
lost
and
with
sarah
that
feeling
was
especially
jarring
it
was
almost
as
though
some
part
of
me
had
come
back
alive
the
fact
is
since
sarah
and
i
were
both
only
children
we
identified
a
lot
with
each
other
true
we
traveled
our
separate
paths
each
looking
perhaps
for
something
to
fill
the
lonely
void
in
our
lives
that
a
sibling
might
have
taken
as
a
child
of
the
dusty
empty
plains
of
west
texas
i
did
see
other
kids
very
much
during
the
summer
and
i
made
up
reasons
why
she
and
i
should
visit
each
other
as
often
as
possible
once
when
i
was
plowing
turning
over
oat
stubble
yes
my
dad
warily
let
me
do
that
if
i
asked
i
unearthed
a
rabbit
nest
full
of
little
baby
cottontails
sarah
was
coming
to
visit
the
next
day
and
i
rescued
the
infants
so
we
could
play
nursery
we
fed
them
milk
with
little
eyedroppers
and
before
long
sarah
decided
she
was
actually
a
reincarnated
mother
rabbit
that
was
when
she
became
a
vegetarian
and
she
remained
so
by
her
account
till
she
finished
college
it
was
just
another
of
those
magic
moments
of
childhood
i
ended
up
sharing
with
her
i
also
sometimes
wondered
as
you
might
have
guessed
what
it
been
like
to
be
born
a
boy
i
was
definitely
a
tomboy
had
a
real
collie
my
own
version
of
lassie
liked
to
climb
trees
and
dig
holes
in
the
hardscrabble
west
texas
earth
maybe
that
was
why
i
felt
so
at
home
free
associating
now
when
i
filmed
my
documentary
of
the
maya
village
in
mexico
yucatan
it
was
hot
and
dry
and
lay
under
a
pitiless
sun
a
blazing
white
bone
in
the
sky
that
seared
the
spare
landscape
none
of
my
crew
could
understand
how
anybody
could
bear
to
live
in
such
a
place
but
to
me
it
seemed
perfectly
natural
almost
like
home
thoughts
of
which
now
made
me
sad
i
only
wish
my
parents
had
lived
long
enough
to
see
that
documentary
maybe
then
they
have
understood
how
terribly
lonely
i
been
as
a
child
a
loneliness
i
shared
so
deeply
with
sarah
would
we
ever
be
together
again
on
my
hurried
trip
downtown
i
kept
wondering
what
i
was
about
to
encounter
was
it
going
to
be
the
sarah
of
her
girlhood
perhaps
the
same
sarah
who
spun
out
some
stuttering
vision
of
a
jade
mask
or
would
all
that
be
past
and
would
she
again
be
the
ambitious
sparkling
student
she
become
when
she
was
in
college
getting
to
soho
took
only
about
ten
minutes
scant
time
to
think
place
was
in
what
had
once
been
a
garment
factory
sweatshop
rented
it
from
another
agent
at
the
bureau
who
had
inherited
it
from
a
cousin
a
downtown
artist
lately
dead
of
aids
lou
paid
virtually
no
rent
was
there
mainly
to
keep
out
squatters
and
care
less
that
he
was
living
in
one
of
new
york
trendier
sections
all
he
knew
was
that
there
was
plenty
of
room
and
free
parking
on
the
street
for
his
old
buick
i
been
down
many
times
before
inside
the
space
was
still
inhabited
spiritually
by
the
dead
artist
with
acrylic
paint
spattered
on
walls
and
graffiti
i
did
fully
understand
in
the
bathroom
the
place
seemed
to
be
a
area
with
layers
of
the
past
littered
on
the
floor
like
an
archaeological
excavation
and
the
old
furniture
fitting
right
in
what
always
struck
me
though
was
the
number
of
photos
of
sarah
they
were
everywhere
in
the
open
space
on
tables
the
desk
several
on
the
walls
mostly
they
were
old
several
blown
up
and
cropped
from
snapshots
grainy
the
space
felt
like
a
shrine
to
her
memory
when
lou
let
me
in
i
was
greeted
by
a
spectral
face
a
wheelchair
and
a
valiant
attempt
at
smiling
normalcy
maybe
lou
thought
it
was
real
was
progress
but
i
was
immediately
on
guard
it
was
sarah
eyes
that
caught
me
they
pierced
into
my
soul
and
we
seemed
to
click
just
like
always
only
this
time
it
was
as
though
all
our
life
together
passed
between
us
i
had
the
sense
she
was
trying
to
tell
me
something
with
her
eyes
that
went
beyond
words
that
she
was
trying
to
reach
out
to
me
perhaps
to
recapture
that
shared
understanding
we
had
years
ago
lou
introduced
me
to
a
reilly
a
kindly
practical
nurse
who
was
part
of
the
outpatient
package
the
hospital
provided
she
wore
a
white
uniform
and
was
around
sixty
with
gray
hair
and
an
air
of
total
authority
she
just
finished
feeding
sarah
a
bowl
of
soup
and
was
brushing
out
her
cropped
blond
hair
what
there
was
of
it
reilly
glanced
at
me
but
never
broke
the
rhythm
of
her
strokes
she
tired
now
but
she
already
stronger
than
she
was
then
lou
spoke
up
they
called
me
early
yesterday
morning
but
by
the
time
i
got
around
to
trying
to
reach
you
you
vanished
so
i
rang
dave
and
he
told
me
where
you
were
up
there
with
that
crackpot
he
was
grinning
no
make
that
beaming
like
the
famous
cat
by
last
night
she
was
walking
with
some
help
so
they
said
she
might
as
well
be
here
like
i
said
it
a
miracle
you
brought
her
home
just
this
morning
i
could
believe
the
hospital
would
discharge
her
so
soon
but
this
was
the
hmo
age
of
medical
only
been
here
a
couple
of
hours
he
pointed
to
a
shiny
set
of
parallel
steel
railings
in
the
corner
that
for
physical
therapy
right
now
she
can
only
walk
with
somebody
on
either
side
holding
her
but
in
a
few
days
i
figure
his
voice
trailed
off
as
though
he
did
want
to
tempt
fortune
then
he
turned
toward
sarah
in
a
few
days
right
honey
she
nodded
then
finally
spoke
directly
to
me
morgy
i
want
some
clothes
please
i
hate
these
horrible
hospital
things
i
never
want
to
see
them
again
i
noticed
that
she
started
crying
a
line
of
tears
down
each
emaciated
cheek
was
it
something
to
do
with
seeing
me
i
wondered
then
she
began
trying
to
struggle
out
of
the
blue
bed
shift
she
was
wearing
though
she
did
have
the
strength
i
get
you
something
great
sar
do
worry
i
reached
to
stay
her
hand
it
was
i
thought
extraordinarily
cold
even
though
the
loft
itself
was
warm
as
toast
what
kind
of
clothes
should
i
buy
for
her
i
found
myself
wondering
blouses
with
buttons
pullovers
what
could
she
manage
maybe
i
bring
some
items
from
home
first
and
let
her
try
them
out
we
used
to
be
about
the
same
size
though
now
she
was
all
skin
and
bones
i
moved
a
chair
next
to
her
took
her
other
hand
and
leaned
as
close
as
i
dared
i
desperately
wanted
to
put
my
arms
around
her
but
i
was
sure
how
she
would
respond
to
my
touch
her
eyes
however
were
clear
and
had
never
looked
a
deeper
blue
sar
what
the
matter
why
you
crying
you
should
be
happy
your
dad
right
here
and
he
loves
you
and
we
going
to
take
wonderful
care
of
you
who
him
she
asked
looking
straight
at
lou
her
blue
eyes
like
an
unblinking
camera
lens
the
plaintive
question
took
my
breath
away
had
they
been
talking
for
two
days
do
pay
any
attention
when
she
says
things
like
that
reilly
declared
her
voice
just
above
a
whisper
she
still
not
quite
herself
she
drifts
in
and
out
she
seemed
to
be
drifting
in
and
out
at
the
moment
though
it
was
mostly
out
then
she
looked
directly
at
me
only
now
her
eyes
were
losing
their
focus
were
starting
to
seem
glazed
who
you
she
reached
out
and
touched
my
unwashed
hair
running
her
hands
through
the
tangled
strands
next
she
stared
off
terrified
her
eyes
full
of
fear
the
smoke
she
whispered
the
knife
i
next
abruptly
she
was
off
again
in
the
reverie
that
had
enfolded
her
that
first
time
in
the
hospital
or
at
least
that
was
what
i
guessed
what
are
you
talking
about
i
felt
like
shaking
her
except
i
was
too
myself
she
turned
back
and
for
a
moment
she
just
stared
first
at
me
next
at
lou
and
finally
at
reilly
then
she
reached
for
a
glass
of
orange
juice
on
the
table
beside
her
she
looked
at
it
as
though
it
were
some
potion
then
slowly
drank
it
off
not
pausing
once
outside
a
faint
police
siren
could
be
heard
and
i
was
afraid
it
was
distracting
her
anyway
something
told
me
her
momentary
séance
was
played
out
her
face
had
grown
calm
and
rested
though
i
could
barely
repress
a
tremble
whatever
you
think
i
said
finally
slipping
an
arm
around
her
shoulder
we
both
right
here
and
we
love
you
and
we
want
to
help
you
get
better
she
did
say
anything
more
just
closed
her
eyes
and
drifted
away
but
it
was
back
into
a
coma
since
her
breathing
was
growing
heavier
i
wanted
to
grab
her
and
yell
at
her
and
demand
that
she
come
back
to
us
but
i
was
fearful
of
what
effect
it
might
have
what
the
hell
was
she
talking
about
lou
asked
finally
his
voice
quavering
i
do
know
i
said
as
puzzled
as
he
was
that
was
when
reilly
spoke
up
she
was
the
only
one
not
upset
when
they
come
out
of
a
coma
sometimes
they
not
right
for
a
while
she
patted
sarah
hand
then
gave
it
a
solicitous
squeeze
i
once
had
a
man
wake
up
and
start
talking
about
magic
trips
through
the
air
about
how
he
was
a
dual
citizen
of
the
earth
and
the
sea
he
was
talking
like
a
lunatic
one
day
he
would
know
his
family
and
the
next
he
would
look
at
them
and
start
screaming
they
come
to
kill
him
you
just
never
know
how
these
things
will
go
at
first
but
she
be
herself
before
long
she
lifted
sarah
limp
hand
up
to
her
cheek
then
kissed
it
you
going
to
be
all
right
dear
i
seen
enough
like
you
to
know
then
what
do
you
make
of
what
she
just
said
lou
asked
her
having
given
up
on
me
earlier
this
morning
she
was
fine
knew
who
i
was
everything
then
the
minute
morgan
comes
in
she
starts
making
up
that
loony
jabber
the
sanguine
reilly
just
shrugged
as
if
it
did
really
matter
for
my
own
part
i
did
necessarily
like
him
implying
my
arrival
had
caused
her
to
relapse
into
her
dream
world
of
terror
it
seemed
to
me
that
whenever
i
showed
up
she
started
trying
to
tell
me
what
was
really
eating
away
at
her
soul
well
i
told
myself
finally
maybe
she
regressed
back
to
when
we
were
kids
when
we
only
had
each
other
to
share
our
secrets
with
what
if
we
rebonded
in
some
new
spe
cial
way
it
would
be
natural
actually
she
trying
to
reach
out
to
me
like
long
ago
now
she
appeared
to
be
dozing
off
exhausted
her
head
tipping
downward
toward
her
blue
hospital
shift
reilly
took
that
as
a
hint
and
slowly
began
wheeling
her
toward
the
bedroom
leaving
me
alone
with
lou
i
glanced
over
at
him
thinking
more
and
more
that
i
had
to
do
something
track
down
what
had
happened
to
her
i
wanted
to
do
it
for
me
but
even
more
for
him
i
never
seen
him
so
despondent
maybe
it
was
the
thing
scholars
call
the
curse
of
rising
expectations
back
when
she
was
hardly
more
than
a
vegetable
he
was
overjoyed
by
a
flickering
eyelid
now
that
she
was
talking
he
wanted
all
of
her
back
instead
though
it
seemed
as
if
she
had
returned
to
us
for
a
moment
only
to
be
snatched
away
again
i
could
tell
it
was
killing
him
look
i
sorry
that
when
i
showed
up
she
started
going
off
the
deep
end
i
wanted
desperately
to
help
but
at
that
moment
i
felt
powerless
maybe
i
should
just
stay
away
for
a
while
nah
she
loves
having
you
here
do
worry
but
anyway
dave
said
something
about
you
taking
a
couple
of
days
off
maybe
i
can
use
that
time
to
be
here
with
her
and
settle
her
down
then
he
grimly
took
out
her
locket
and
rubbed
its
worn
silver
in
his
fingers
his
eyes
brimming
with
his
heartache
this
is
all
just
so
damned
confusing
was
he
telling
me
indirectly
that
i
should
go
away
and
leave
them
alone
first
hannah
klein
rejects
me
and
now
lou
maybe
i
thought
he
taking
out
his
despair
on
me
blaming
me
for
her
relapse
truthfully
i
guess
i
was
blaming
myself
a
bit
too
listen
i
going
to
go
home
now
and
leave
you
two
alone
i
said
but
why
do
you
see
if
you
can
get
her
to
talk
some
more
without
me
around
maybe
she
make
more
sense
if
she
wants
to
say
something
i
listen
he
gave
me
a
strong
absent
embrace
his
eyes
still
despondent
but
no
way
am
i
gon
na
start
pushing
her
i
edged
into
the
bedroom
unsure
if
i
really
should
to
say
to
sarah
and
to
give
her
one
last
hug
her
eyes
were
open
again
and
she
just
stared
at
me
for
a
second
then
whispered
a
word
i
could
quite
make
out
it
might
have
sounded
like
babylon
but
that
made
no
sense
at
all
finally
she
covered
her
eyes
with
her
hands
and
turned
away
gone
from
me
leaving
me
more
alone
than
i
ever
felt
chapter
eleven
heading
home
finally
i
told
myself
to
try
to
calm
down
i
was
determined
to
help
sarah
get
over
her
trauma
though
truthfully
i
was
too
tired
to
really
think
straight
at
that
moment
so
instead
i
decided
to
let
everything
rest
for
a
few
hours
and
try
for
some
distance
in
fact
i
began
imagining
myself
in
a
hot
bath
gazing
at
my
roses
home
sweet
home
mine
was
a
standard
in
a
building
that
had
been
turned
into
a
five
years
earlier
the
owner
offering
the
individual
apartments
to
the
tenants
i
stayed
a
renter
however
passing
up
the
low
insider
price
because
i
did
really
have
the
money
and
when
i
did
have
it
someday
i
would
want
something
bigger
i
wished
i
had
more
space
a
real
dining
room
and
a
bigger
bathroom
would
do
for
starters
along
with
some
place
for
more
bookcases
and
if
a
baby
should
someday
miraculously
come
along
i
often
thought
you
could
tell
a
lot
about
somebody
from
where
and
how
they
lived
it
revealing
as
a
rorschach
test
what
i
often
wondered
did
my
apartment
say
about
me
a
decorator
might
conclude
i
done
up
the
place
with
love
then
lazily
let
it
go
they
decide
i
cared
about
nice
things
but
once
those
nice
things
were
there
i
neglected
them
it
would
be
true
i
covered
the
walls
of
the
living
room
with
pale
blue
cloth
then
hung
a
lot
of
framed
pictures
and
old
movie
posters
okay
i
like
movies
for
me
even
the
posters
are
art
my
couch
was
an
more
like
actually
and
covered
with
pillows
for
the
feminine
touch
i
hoped
you
have
to
look
twice
to
realize
it
was
actually
a
storage
cabinet
in
disguise
with
drawers
along
the
bottom
of
the
front
the
floor
was
polished
hardwood
rugs
from
india
here
and
there
in
sore
need
of
a
vacuuming
and
even
a
couple
of
deceased
insects
that
been
there
for
over
a
week
that
sort
of
said
it
i
thought
glumly
i
a
workaholic
slob
the
bedroom
revealed
even
more
about
me
the
bed
was
a
brass
partly
covered
by
an
heirloom
quilt
it
been
made
in
a
week
who
has
the
time
the
room
itself
was
long
and
divided
into
areas
for
work
and
sleep
opposite
the
bed
itself
was
an
antique
english
desk
on
which
sat
my
old
macintosh
and
next
to
that
was
my
file
cabinet
the
indispensable
part
of
the
home
office
the
irs
loves
to
hate
on
top
of
it
was
a
stack
of
scripts
notes
scribbled
all
over
them
in
six
different
colors
you
never
realize
movies
are
so
complicated
till
you
see
a
breakdown
sheet
camera
angles
and
and
next
to
the
bed
was
a
violin
case
and
three
books
about
indian
ragas
what
was
that
about
somebody
might
wonder
some
kind
of
indian
music
nut
i
was
albeit
a
very
minimally
talented
nut
the
kitchen
was
the
new
york
efficiency
kind
painted
a
glossy
tan
the
color
of
aerosol
olive
oil
the
cabinets
contained
mostly
packages
of
pasta
instant
soup
and
coffee
filters
not
even
any
real
food
i
live
on
deli
takeout
these
days
an
inventory
of
my
fridge
at
this
moment
would
clock
two
cartons
of
fresh
squeezed
orange
juice
a
half
quart
of
spoiling
milk
a
bag
of
coffee
beans
plastic
containers
of
wilting
veggies
from
the
corner
salad
bar
and
three
bottles
of
new
york
seltzer
that
was
it
god
help
me
i
thought
my
turning
even
more
morose
this
is
my
life
i
had
become
that
retrograde
woman
of
the
nineties
works
ninety
hours
a
week
makes
ninety
thou
a
year
weighs
ninety
pounds
and
thinks
pardon
my
french
cooking
and
fucking
are
provinces
in
northern
china
well
the
part
of
that
obscene
quip
did
fit
and
it
was
the
nineties
anymore
anyway
in
any
case
was
my
apartment
a
place
to
raise
a
child
no
earthly
way
like
carly
i
have
to
spring
for
some
decent
space
preferably
with
a
washing
machine
a
parking
slot
was
open
right
in
front
of
my
building
a
minor
miracle
on
this
day
of
uncertain
events
as
i
was
pulling
in
i
glanced
over
to
see
a
man
walking
past
not
catching
the
face
but
sensing
something
familiar
in
the
walk
he
was
in
the
process
of
unbuttoning
a
federal
express
uniform
peeling
away
the
top
to
reveal
a
dark
suit
he
certainly
seemed
to
be
in
a
big
hurry
carrying
an
unmarked
shopping
bag
maybe
i
thought
his
shift
was
over
and
he
was
meeting
his
wife
or
a
friend
i
wondered
if
he
left
a
package
for
me
and
told
myself
to
check
with
the
super
not
the
usual
delivery
guy
did
they
come
on
sunday
now
and
also
where
was
the
truck
they
always
parked
right
here
by
the
building
i
was
still
so
upset
over
sarah
i
could
immediately
process
those
illogical
observations
so
i
just
grabbed
my
pink
roses
dripping
from
the
bottom
of
their
paper
wrapping
and
opened
the
car
door
it
was
definitely
good
to
be
home
i
loved
my
chelsea
neighborhood
where
you
got
to
know
the
locals
running
into
them
in
the
delis
the
little
restaurants
the
dry
cleaners
just
like
a
small
town
if
you
worked
at
home
the
way
i
sometimes
did
you
even
got
to
know
the
mailman
and
the
delivery
guys
for
ups
and
fedex
hey
that
guy
i
finally
placed
the
walk
a
kind
of
a
strut
he
was
the
slimeball
who
been
outside
paula
marks
building
last
week
carrying
a
gun
and
threatening
me
what
he
doing
here
my
pulse
went
off
the
charts
was
he
one
of
nicky
russo
wiseguy
crew
after
all
had
he
come
back
with
his
pistol
to
pay
me
a
return
engagement
my
god
chill
out
i
told
myself
take
a
deep
breath
he
leaving
just
try
and
find
out
who
he
is
roses
in
one
hand
held
up
awkwardly
around
my
face
i
slowly
ambled
down
the
street
after
him
i
did
have
to
go
far
within
about
a
hundred
feet
he
unlocked
a
long
black
lincoln
towncar
stepped
out
of
the
fedex
camouflage
tossed
it
onto
the
seat
along
with
the
bag
he
was
carrying
pulled
the
cap
off
his
bald
head
got
in
and
sped
away
the
license
plate
looked
different
from
the
usual
but
i
got
what
i
needed
dl
and
a
string
of
numbers
i
thought
was
he
leaving
a
package
bomb
for
me
i
turned
back
and
let
myself
into
the
outer
lobby
glancing
around
as
i
did
there
were
no
parcels
anywhere
just
blank
brown
tile
my
apartment
was
the
name
on
the
bell
was
james
as
i
stepped
through
the
inner
lobby
still
no
package
a
rumpled
face
appeared
in
the
doorway
just
to
my
left
the
sign
on
it
flaking
said
super
oh
hi
the
voice
was
patrick
mooney
our
superintendent
who
did
not
normally
emerge
to
greet
those
arriving
but
there
had
been
complaints
from
the
building
managing
agent
that
he
could
never
be
found
for
emergencies
so
he
probably
wanted
to
appear
available
even
on
sundays
his
voice
was
slurred
from
some
midday
medicinal
irish
whisky
thought
you
were
home
fedex
guy
was
here
earlier
looking
for
you
oh
boy
did
he
leave
a
package
he
had
something
with
him
if
that
what
you
mean
like
a
bag
of
some
kind
and
you
let
him
go
up
i
could
believe
what
i
was
hearing
i
felt
a
rush
of
dismay
said
he
had
to
needed
a
signature
patrick
mooney
then
shrugged
and
reached
for
the
dooijamb
to
steady
himself
his
whisky
breath
wafting
across
the
hall
great
security
i
stepped
into
the
elevator
as
the
door
was
clanking
shut
and
watched
as
he
rubbed
his
eyes
and
eased
his
own
door
closed
now
i
was
really
puzzled
if
the
fedex
guy
came
earlier
why
was
he
just
now
leaving
a
lot
of
scary
theories
went
through
my
mind
as
i
pushed
the
button
for
the
third
floor
i
took
a
deep
breath
as
the
elevator
opened
but
again
i
saw
no
packages
so
far
so
good
getting
off
i
set
down
my
roses
on
the
hall
carpet
and
fumbled
for
my
key
when
i
inserted
it
the
lock
felt
a
little
rough
causing
me
to
think
for
an
instant
i
used
the
wrong
key
but
then
it
responded
what
had
caused
that
i
wondered
had
the
guy
been
fiddling
with
my
door
wiring
a
bomb
using
one
hand
i
pushed
it
open
again
holding
my
breath
and
standing
aside
but
it
opened
okay
i
exhaled
then
reached
back
to
drag
in
the
flowers
but
if
he
did
leave
a
package
what
was
he
doing
here
casing
out
where
i
lived
planting
a
bug
in
the
elevator
and
why
was
he
here
so
long
the
place
was
dark
when
i
stepped
in
the
drapes
drawn
i
relocked
the
door
then
surveyed
the
gloom
no
explosions
so
i
guessed
he
plan
to
kill
me
yet
here
i
was
home
safe
and
sound
i
just
stood
a
minute
still
uneasy
then
i
remembered
the
flowers
my
dripping
bouquet
and
headed
for
the
kitchen
deal
with
them
and
then
maybe
get
a
bottle
of
white
wine
out
of
the
fridge
and
sip
some
in
the
bath
after
my
unnerving
sequence
with
sarah
thoughts
of
going
to
the
office
had
zero
appeal
time
to
lighten
up
way
up
preoccupied
not
looking
around
i
stuffed
the
roses
into
a
vase
by
the
sink
and
then
i
thought
again
about
the
white
wine
and
opened
the
refrigerator
i
still
not
bothered
to
turn
on
any
lights
but
the
kitchen
and
its
ancient
fridge
were
dimly
illuminated
by
the
tiny
window
just
across
i
was
sure
where
i
put
the
bottle
since
had
to
rearrange
things
to
make
room
for
the
dup
of
carly
interview
i
was
also
planning
to
take
home
a
safety
dup
of
paula
interview
sometime
later
in
the
week
why
was
i
doing
that
taking
home
copies
it
was
a
sign
of
deep
compulsion
you
could
really
make
a
second
negative
from
a
first
positive
by
that
time
it
would
be
but
i
brought
it
anyway
now
and
then
i
just
have
a
raw
instinct
that
keeping
a
safety
backup
around
is
a
good
idea
but
the
canister
had
ended
up
devouring
the
entire
lower
shelf
of
the
fridge
i
opened
the
white
door
and
peered
in
the
light
was
out
and
for
a
moment
i
stared
numbly
at
the
dark
shelves
the
only
thing
that
struck
me
as
odd
was
that
i
could
see
the
pure
white
of
the
empty
bottom
shelf
for
a
second
i
could
only
stand
and
stare
but
then
i
backed
away
trying
to
figure
out
what
was
wrong
and
stumbled
over
something
i
regained
my
balance
and
flipped
on
the
overhead
light
what
the
floor
around
me
was
littered
with
bottles
my
old
toaster
my
tiny
microwave
it
was
a
total
shambles
i
recoiled
stumbling
again
this
time
over
cans
strewn
across
the
linoleum
my
kitchen
it
was
slowly
sinking
in
had
been
completely
trashed
i
felt
a
visceral
wave
of
nausea
it
the
scariest
thing
in
the
world
having
your
space
invaded
like
a
form
of
psychic
rape
i
sagged
against
the
refrigerator
as
i
gazed
around
the
cabinets
had
been
emptied
out
a
hasty
and
haphazard
search
quick
and
extremely
dirty
as
glass
containers
of
condiments
including
an
old
bottle
of
dill
pickles
were
shattered
and
their
contents
smeared
into
the
floor
i
do
believe
this
i
marched
back
into
the
living
room
and
reached
for
the
lights
this
room
too
had
been
turned
upside
down
the
tv
stereo
vcr
all
had
been
swept
onto
the
rug
but
they
were
still
there
that
guy
that
animal
who
did
this
was
a
thief
he
been
looking
for
something
my
breath
now
coming
in
pulses
i
edged
into
the
bedroom
and
switched
on
the
light
the
bed
was
the
way
i
left
it
the
covers
thrown
back
and
the
pillows
in
a
pile
the
clock
radio
was
there
and
so
was
the
old
mac
still
on
the
table
in
the
far
corner
my
workstation
again
nothing
seemed
to
be
missing
i
headed
back
to
the
kitchen
where
the
refrigerator
door
was
still
open
i
gazed
at
the
interior
a
moment
still
puzzled
trying
to
figure
out
what
was
right
shit
shit
shit
that
what
was
wrong
the
field
of
white
bottom
shelf
was
empty
totally
empty
the
film
canister
of
paula
interview
was
gone
for
a
moment
i
just
leaned
against
the
kitchen
counter
barely
pushing
aside
an
impulse
to
throw
up
in
the
sink
think
i
told
myself
get
a
grip
and
think
it
was
the
film
he
wanted
and
he
wanted
it
badly
enough
to
pick
the
lock
then
rip
my
home
apart
looking
for
it
i
pulled
at
a
tangle
of
hair
feeling
my
mind
in
chaos
and
tried
to
reason
out
the
situation
why
why
would
he
steal
a
positive
that
could
be
used
for
anything
finally
the
real
truth
of
what
had
happened
hit
me
like
a
fist
in
the
chest
my
home
sweet
home
had
been
violated
seething
i
went
into
the
living
room
and
reached
for
the
phone
the
only
thing
not
on
the
floor
my
first
instinct
was
to
call
david
but
then
i
decided
he
just
go
into
a
tizzy
of
hysteria
and
be
no
support
at
all
so
instead
i
called
lou
praying
i
would
wake
sarah
in
an
unsteady
voice
i
tried
to
tell
him
what
had
happened
he
seemed
puzzled
to
hear
from
me
again
so
soon
but
then
he
quickly
turned
fbi
concerned
for
my
safety
guy
sounds
like
a
professional
he
declared
probably
got
in
with
an
electric
picker
like
the
edge
any
asshole
can
buy
one
for
a
hundred
and
thirty
bucks
it
rake
cylinders
at
a
hundred
times
a
second
pro
like
that
you
can
be
sure
there
be
no
prints
but
why
would
my
voice
was
still
a
croak
i
mean
my
god
all
for
a
lousy
reel
of
film
fucker
wants
you
to
know
he
in
town
so
how
he
did
it
as
important
as
what
he
did
it
a
scare
tactic
he
paused
morgan
i
do
like
this
one
bit
there
could
be
more
before
this
is
over
think
i
should
call
the
cops
damned
right
you
should
he
said
slowly
and
sadly
but
to
tell
you
the
truth
they
ai
gon
na
do
all
that
much
somebody
messed
up
your
apartment
and
lifted
a
copy
of
a
woman
talking
they
say
it
sounds
more
like
malicious
mischief
than
a
crime
then
they
write
it
up
and
that
be
the
last
you
hear
from
them
well
i
said
my
anger
welling
up
maybe
i
do
feel
quite
so
tell
me
you
know
anybody
who
can
run
a
plate
for
you
on
a
sunday
you
got
the
prick
license
number
he
exclaimed
why
the
hell
did
you
say
so
honestly
it
sort
of
slipped
my
mind
i
having
a
little
trouble
thinking
straight
right
now
fortunately
my
memory
is
pretty
good
even
when
stressed
so
i
spewed
it
out
do
go
anywhere
he
declared
i
get
back
to
you
in
five
minutes
i
hung
up
the
phone
and
lay
down
flat
out
on
the
carpet
trying
a
breathing
exercise
to
calm
down
the
problem
was
it
was
working
having
had
some
experience
with
being
robbed
i
once
got
completely
cleaned
out
when
i
had
a
apartment
down
in
the
village
i
know
you
go
through
certain
stages
of
anger
denial
depression
acceptance
you
also
go
through
a
predictable
series
of
recriminations
i
should
have
had
window
bars
and
gates
i
should
have
had
a
different
lock
i
should
have
had
two
different
locks
in
the
instance
just
recalled
i
virtually
certain
an
apartment
painter
duplicated
a
set
of
my
keys
on
his
lunch
break
and
then
passed
them
on
to
a
artist
no
way
to
prove
that
mind
you
but
it
had
to
be
what
happened
i
also
suspect
he
checked
my
appointments
calendar
to
see
when
i
was
going
to
be
out
of
town
but
in
this
case
the
lock
was
definitely
picked
nobody
had
a
set
of
my
keys
except
the
super
and
steve
so
the
guy
with
the
spanish
accent
knew
how
to
slip
through
doors
and
he
had
no
financial
interest
in
my
old
vcr
he
only
had
an
interest
in
my
film
what
had
he
said
there
on
the
sidewalk
outside
paula
marks
apartment
something
about
how
making
this
picture
was
a
big
mistake
i
jumped
as
the
phone
erupted
by
my
ear
the
name
colonel
jose
alvino
ramos
grijalva
mean
anything
to
you
lou
asked
how
could
it
i
not
sure
i
can
even
pronounce
it
well
colonel
ramos
declares
himself
to
be
a
military
attaché
at
the
guatemalan
consulate
here
you
got
a
big
shot
in
the
guatemalan
army
rummaging
through
your
apartment
this
is
even
worse
than
i
thought
those
guys
are
killers
jesus
i
was
still
coming
to
grips
with
the
horrifying
fact
he
been
in
my
apartment
in
my
only
refuge
think
i
could
bring
charges
against
him
well
let
consider
this
a
minute
probably
no
prints
no
credible
witness
you
have
a
damned
hard
time
proving
anything
he
sighed
truth
is
i
doubt
you
could
even
get
a
restraining
order
given
what
little
you
got
to
work
with
the
bastard
i
sat
a
moment
feeling
the
logical
left
side
of
my
brain
just
shut
down
my
mind
went
back
to
its
most
primitive
level
running
on
adrenaline
look
i
need
to
check
out
something
i
call
you
in
the
morning
well
be
careful
he
said
warily
and
for
god
sake
do
go
running
off
anyplace
alone
i
telling
you
you
not
safe
always
be
around
people
i
keep
it
in
mind
with
that
i
gently
hung
up
the
phone
and
exhaled
think
some
colonel
from
guatemala
just
broke
into
my
apartment
looking
for
what
i
might
know
about
children
of
light
where
i
been
going
to
see
about
having
a
baby
so
why
is
he
so
interested
in
what
i
doing
i
remembered
alex
goddard
wanted
me
to
go
to
a
clinic
he
had
somewhere
in
central
america
ten
to
one
that
clinic
was
in
guatemala
that
was
what
this
whole
thing
was
about
and
now
he
just
gone
back
there
at
least
that
was
what
he
said
guatemala
was
a
long
way
off
but
his
other
operation
was
right
up
the
river
i
had
seen
all
of
it
this
morning
but
that
was
about
to
change
a
lot
of
things
were
about
to
change
it
was
time
to
start
getting
the
playing
field
level
again
chapter
twelve
i
arranged
with
patrick
mooney
to
have
his
sister
in
queens
a
woman
named
rosalyn
come
in
and
finish
the
job
of
reconstructing
my
wrecked
home
she
arrived
an
hour
and
a
half
later
and
was
hard
at
work
when
i
left
i
also
agonized
over
the
issue
but
finally
decided
to
forgo
the
bother
lou
was
right
it
would
be
a
ordeal
of
futility
besides
i
had
better
things
to
do
with
my
time
i
was
going
to
return
the
favor
of
an
expedition
alex
goddard
had
said
he
be
absent
from
quetzal
manor
who
knows
for
how
long
and
this
time
around
i
was
going
to
do
the
place
right
the
next
step
in
my
undercover
research
the
first
and
main
thing
i
wanted
to
do
was
explore
the
new
clinic
that
sat
nestled
in
the
woods
across
from
the
old
building
everything
about
it
was
the
exact
opposite
of
a
manor
not
a
shred
of
new
age
spirituality
just
a
lot
of
digital
equipment
and
ultrasound
and
what
else
chief
among
my
questions
what
was
behind
that
big
white
door
maybe
i
was
being
impulsive
but
i
was
completely
wired
and
the
truth
was
i
was
going
to
sleep
till
i
knew
a
lot
more
than
i
did
and
if
i
went
late
tonight
sunday
i
probably
would
have
to
deal
with
ramala
i
called
roger
drexel
my
unshaven
cameraman
and
asked
him
to
come
up
and
meet
me
at
applecore
it
was
sunday
and
he
was
watching
the
third
quarter
of
a
knicks
game
and
into
his
second
but
he
agreed
after
all
i
was
his
current
boss
all
i
really
wanted
was
his
betacam
and
some
metal
tape
which
would
be
broadcast
quality
i
wanted
to
do
it
yesterday
but
now
the
time
had
definitely
come
we
met
at
the
office
and
he
unlocked
the
room
with
the
camera
gear
and
loaded
in
a
fresh
tape
with
any
luck
he
made
it
home
for
the
end
of
the
game
i
then
had
a
sinful
cheeseburger
and
fries
at
a
greek
diner
two
blocks
down
the
avenue
it
was
my
idea
of
a
indulgence
my
watch
read
six
and
daylight
was
waning
when
i
revved
my
old
toyota
and
started
my
northbound
trek
back
to
quetzal
manor
when
i
was
passing
the
george
washington
bridge
the
first
drifting
flakes
of
a
freak
snowstorm
began
pelting
my
windshield
good
i
thought
turning
on
my
wipers
the
less
visibility
the
better
at
least
i
believed
that
till
the
road
started
getting
slippery
and
i
had
to
throttle
back
it
was
only
then
i
realized
i
been
pushing
eighty
on
the
speedometer
passing
a
lot
of
cars
lou
warning
not
to
go
anywhere
alone
was
still
filed
in
the
back
of
my
mind
but
i
kept
trying
not
to
think
about
it
sometimes
there
are
things
you
just
got
to
do
the
highway
grew
more
treacherous
the
farther
north
i
went
but
the
traffic
was
thinning
out
and
by
the
time
i
reached
the
turnoff
to
quetzal
manor
total
darkness
had
set
in
in
addition
to
which
the
paving
was
covered
with
at
least
an
inch
of
pristine
snow
as
i
eased
up
the
roadway
my
headlights
made
the
trees
around
me
glisten
with
their
light
dusting
of
white
like
frosting
on
the
tips
of
a
buzz
cut
i
switched
off
my
lights
as
i
made
the
last
turn
in
the
road
but
not
before
catching
a
glimpse
of
quetzal
manor
and
i
must
confess
to
feeling
a
shudder
of
both
anger
and
apprehension
run
through
me
as
i
watched
its
magisterial
turrets
disappear
into
the
snowy
dark
i
parked
my
car
at
the
back
of
the
lot
and
retrieved
the
flashlight
brought
a
yellow
plastic
model
i
had
realized
be
snow
when
i
left
home
so
i
was
just
wearing
some
old
sneakers
but
they
do
i
then
sat
there
in
the
dark
for
a
long
minute
listening
to
the
silence
and
thinking
the
first
thing
was
to
find
out
if
anybody
was
guarding
the
place
the
next
was
to
get
some
video
of
the
new
building
i
grabbed
the
bag
carrying
the
betacam
tested
my
flashlight
against
the
floorboard
and
then
headed
up
the
snowy
driveway
i
marched
straight
through
the
open
arch
that
was
the
front
door
and
i
was
again
in
the
drafty
hallway
where
i
met
ramala
saturday
morning
it
was
empty
and
dark
now
no
lights
anywhere
not
even
out
in
the
courtyard
beyond
the
stony
quiet
no
music
no
chants
felt
unnatural
but
it
also
suggested
that
alex
goddard
adoring
acolytes
were
safely
tucked
away
early
to
bed
you
know
the
rest
so
maybe
i
really
had
come
at
the
right
time
a
chilly
wind
was
blowing
in
from
the
far
end
of
the
hallway
and
i
felt
like
i
just
entered
a
dank
tomb
but
i
tightened
my
coat
and
pressed
on
when
i
got
to
the
end
and
looked
out
the
snowy
courtyard
was
like
a
picture
postcard
and
completely
empty
all
right
i
thought
move
on
to
what
you
came
for
but
when
i
turned
and
headed
back
down
the
hallway
toward
the
entry
arch
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
furtive
form
dark
and
shadowy
lurking
just
outside
shit
i
froze
in
my
tracks
but
then
the
figure
stepped
inside
wearing
something
that
made
me
think
of
little
red
riding
hood
like
a
tiny
ghost
in
a
cowl
it
was
tara
alex
goddard
spacey
waif
who
was
moving
so
oddly
i
thought
for
a
moment
she
might
be
sleepwalking
she
was
of
course
she
just
been
out
strolling
around
the
driveway
in
the
snow
i
soon
realized
she
lived
her
life
in
something
resembling
a
trance
as
though
she
were
a
permanent
denizen
of
the
spirit
world
for
her
it
was
a
natural
condition
it
so
beautiful
like
this
she
mumbled
dreamily
as
though
been
in
the
middle
of
a
lifelong
conversation
i
just
love
it
her
voice
was
barely
above
a
whisper
but
in
the
silence
it
seemed
to
ricochet
off
the
stone
walls
i
want
to
take
them
out
show
them
paintbrush
will
you
help
me
take
who
out
i
asked
immediately
deciding
to
go
with
the
moment
finally
she
looked
directly
at
me
and
realized
whom
she
been
talking
to
you
were
here
before
i
tried
to
give
you
herbs
to
help
you
but
then
he
came
and
her
voice
trailed
off
as
she
walked
back
through
the
portico
and
out
again
into
the
drifting
snow
then
she
held
up
her
hands
as
though
attempting
to
capture
the
flakes
as
keepsakes
i
so
want
to
show
them
they
never
seen
it
before
she
glanced
back
at
me
come
on
let
do
it
as
i
followed
her
out
into
the
drifting
white
and
across
the
parking
lot
the
accumulation
of
snow
was
growing
denser
enough
now
to
start
covering
the
cars
but
still
something
told
me
the
flurry
was
going
to
be
i
took
a
long
misty
breath
of
the
moist
air
and
clicked
open
the
case
holding
the
betacam
readying
myself
to
take
it
out
the
minute
we
got
inside
well
i
thought
maybe
i
gotten
lucky
she
was
headed
for
the
new
clinic
which
was
exactly
where
i
wanted
to
go
it
was
nestled
in
the
trees
up
a
winding
pathway
and
as
i
slogged
along
i
could
feel
the
snow
melting
through
my
sneakers
when
we
got
to
the
front
door
large
and
made
of
glass
she
just
pushed
it
open
we
never
lock
anything
she
declared
glancing
back
it
one
of
our
rules
the
hallway
was
dark
silent
and
empty
except
for
the
two
of
us
still
i
felt
a
tinge
of
caution
as
we
entered
at
some
level
this
was
trespassing
come
on
she
said
casually
flipping
a
switch
on
the
wall
and
causing
the
overhead
fluorescents
to
blink
on
he
away
now
and
everybody
in
bed
but
i
bet
they
still
awake
in
here
it
a
perfect
time
i
did
feel
anything
was
perfect
but
i
did
know
i
wanted
to
learn
what
was
behind
the
door
i
seen
when
i
was
leaving
it
was
at
the
end
of
the
hallway
wide
and
steel
and
painted
hospital
white
and
sure
enough
that
was
exactly
where
tara
was
heading
she
just
kept
talking
nonstop
in
her
dreamy
voice
got
to
try
and
make
them
understand
it
okay
that
it
be
just
for
a
minute
she
shoved
open
the
door
without
knocking
and
my
ears
were
greeted
by
the
faint
strains
of
beethoven
moonlight
sonata
one
of
my
favorites
for
an
instant
i
was
caught
up
in
the
music
a
poignant
moment
drawing
me
in
the
room
itself
was
spacious
with
a
row
of
white
bassinets
along
one
side
and
subdued
lighting
provided
by
small
fluorescent
bulbs
along
the
walls
it
was
i
immediately
realized
a
nursery
alongside
the
bassinets
were
tables
with
formula
and
boxes
of
pampers
and
two
short
women
of
indefinable
nationality
they
looked
vaguely
asian
were
in
attendance
and
at
the
moment
one
was
facing
away
and
bouncing
a
baby
on
her
shoulder
her
infant
looked
like
a
boy
or
was
that
just
my
imagination
and
i
felt
my
heart
go
out
the
light
was
dim
but
i
could
tell
he
was
a
gorgeous
kid
plump
and
peachy
so
sublime
in
his
tender
vulnerability
as
he
gazed
around
with
eyes
full
of
trust
he
was
staring
directly
back
at
me
and
before
i
could
stop
myself
i
gave
him
a
little
wave
and
wrinkled
my
nose
he
stared
at
me
a
second
then
responded
with
a
tiny
smile
hey
i
thought
i
got
the
touch
come
on
tara
said
ignoring
the
women
let
me
show
you
they
all
so
beautiful
by
then
my
eyes
were
adjusting
to
the
subdued
light
and
as
we
walked
down
the
middle
of
the
long
room
i
confirmed
my
assumption
that
the
bassinets
next
to
the
tables
all
contained
infants
i
no
expert
on
babies
but
i
guess
they
were
all
around
six
weeks
old
maybe
a
couple
of
months
at
most
this
is
the
nest
i
thought
ground
zero
kevin
and
rachel
were
both
probably
in
this
room
at
one
time
too
are
they
wonderful
tara
was
saying
still
in
her
squeaky
voice
i
was
opening
the
betacam
bag
when
the
first
woman
the
one
holding
and
lightly
bouncing
her
little
boy
absently
put
her
hand
under
his
quilt
then
spoke
to
the
other
in
deeply
accented
english
he
wet
again
it
was
the
first
words
either
of
them
had
uttered
then
she
turned
to
me
in
exasperation
assuming
i
suppose
that
i
was
one
of
alex
goddard
flock
and
i
just
changed
him
again
the
accent
but
i
still
could
identify
it
she
made
a
face
then
carried
him
over
to
a
plywood
changing
table
in
the
center
of
the
room
i
felt
a
great
as
i
moved
over
beside
her
but
she
was
behaving
like
a
typical
hourly
glumly
going
about
her
job
and
i
just
stood
there
a
moment
vainly
wanting
to
hold
him
then
turned
back
to
tara
where
do
all
these
children
come
from
ramala
says
they
orphans
or
abandoned
or
something
from
overseas
or
wherever
she
sighed
they
so
perfect
she
was
completely
it
felt
like
talking
to
a
marshmallow
on
downers
but
how
exactly
do
people
bring
them
here
she
seemed
uninterested
in
the
question
just
plunging
on
as
she
wandered
on
down
the
line
of
bassinets
i
finally
come
to
my
senses
enough
to
take
out
the
betacam
though
the
light
was
actually
enough
to
really
work
with
certainly
not
broadcast
quality
she
stopped
and
picked
up
one
of
the
infants
out
of
its
bassinet
then
turned
back
to
me
her
eyes
turning
soft
as
she
hugged
it
the
way
she
might
a
small
puppy
is
this
one
cute
i
so
love
to
have
him
was
she
on
some
kind
of
drug
that
suppressed
curiosity
i
found
myself
wondering
as
i
panned
the
camera
around
the
room
there
must
have
been
at
least
twenty
bassinets
all
just
alike
wicker
with
a
white
lace
hood
a
couple
of
the
babies
were
sniffling
and
the
one
tara
had
picked
up
now
began
crying
outright
much
to
her
annoyance
the
room
itself
smelled
like
baby
powder
and
then
what
happens
i
asked
finally
zooming
in
on
one
of
the
women
what
happens
when
now
tara
was
twirling
in
a
circle
humming
futilely
to
the
shrieking
child
you
mean
after
they
come
here
right
god
getting
answers
from
her
was
making
me
crazy
the
girls
here
take
them
to
their
new
mothers
her
eyes
had
turned
even
more
dreamy
as
she
lightly
bounced
the
bawling
bundle
she
was
holding
one
last
time
after
which
she
returned
it
to
its
bassinet
then
she
gazed
around
the
room
it
so
sad
to
see
them
leave
did
paula
and
carly
get
their
babies
that
way
i
found
myself
wondering
probably
but
it
was
one
more
thing
i
neglected
to
ask
come
on
tara
continued
let
take
some
of
them
out
he
makes
the
nurses
try
and
speak
english
around
the
children
but
they
do
really
know
much
maybe
you
could
figure
out
a
way
to
like
explain
tara
i
do
think
taking
any
of
these
babies
out
into
the
snow
is
a
very
hot
idea
not
tonight
maybe
in
the
morning
stall
her
i
thought
she
completely
out
of
it
then
i
looked
at
the
woman
changing
the
baby
sure
enough
i
was
right
it
was
a
boy
but
i
want
to
tara
turned
crestfallen
to
show
them
how
beautiful
well
i
do
speak
whatever
language
they
speaking
i
said
cutting
cut
her
off
i
not
even
sure
i
could
make
it
sound
reasonable
in
english
so
you
have
to
do
it
without
my
help
then
i
turned
to
the
woman
who
been
changing
the
baby
do
you
know
where
this
child
came
from
why
not
take
a
shot
she
just
stared
at
me
alarmed
then
turned
away
nothing
she
clearly
was
going
to
tell
me
anything
even
if
she
could
she
and
the
others
were
just
cheap
hired
help
probably
illegal
immigrants
without
a
green
card
and
scared
to
death
for
their
jobs
they
were
going
to
be
doing
an
to
anybody
i
thought
about
the
situation
for
a
moment
and
decided
i
seen
what
i
came
to
see
this
was
pay
dirt
alex
goddard
was
running
a
adoption
mill
just
as
lou
had
suspected
he
was
collecting
beautiful
white
babies
from
overseas
or
wherever
and
selling
them
here
at
sixty
thousand
a
pop
which
went
a
long
way
toward
explaining
why
he
did
want
children
of
light
to
be
featured
in
my
film
and
the
guatemalan
colonel
who
just
trashed
my
home
was
almost
certainly
in
on
the
operation
alex
goddard
might
be
a
new
age
miracle
worker
rediscovering
ancient
native
american
herbal
cures
but
he
also
was
running
a
very
efficient
money
machine
still
the
big
question
kept
coming
back
where
did
he
get
all
the
babies
to
extract
any
more
information
about
that
from
quetzal
manor
i
have
to
break
into
an
office
somewhere
and
i
was
quite
up
to
that
yet
i
did
have
the
nerve
of
colonel
jose
alvino
ramos
tell
you
what
tara
i
think
i
out
of
here
i
was
returning
the
betacam
to
its
bag
nothing
i
shot
was
remotely
broadcast
quality
but
i
did
have
proof
of
what
was
going
on
my
undercover
investigation
was
making
some
headway
okay
she
sighed
her
expression
increasingly
glazed
i
took
one
last
look
around
the
room
at
the
row
of
bassinets
then
gave
her
a
parting
pat
and
headed
for
the
exit
look
i
said
turning
back
as
i
reached
the
door
do
say
anything
to
anybody
about
me
being
here
tonight
okay
can
we
just
let
it
be
our
secret
sure
whatever
she
shrugged
absently
like
why
not
and
tara
do
yourself
a
favor
get
out
of
this
place
but
there
nowhere
else
i
can
go
she
said
sadness
in
her
eyes
as
i
slowly
closed
the
door
the
last
thing
i
heard
was
the
sound
of
the
beethoven
sonata
dying
away
what
a
day
and
night
as
i
walked
down
the
hallway
carrying
the
camera
bag
i
tried
to
process
my
new
information
i
just
seen
some
of
the
most
incredibly
lovable
babies
ever
that
part
of
it
was
a
beautiful
experience
one
that
pulled
at
my
heartstrings
more
strongly
than
i
ever
imagined
something
like
that
could
the
part
that
troubled
me
was
the
babies
were
so
alike
so
fair
and
they
all
could
have
been
perfect
siblings
for
kevin
and
rachel
no
i
told
myself
surely
that
was
my
imagination
though
they
did
look
amazingly
related
as
i
moved
across
the
parking
lot
i
thought
i
saw
a
movement
in
the
shadows
just
inside
the
entry
archway
a
quick
change
in
the
pattern
of
dark
was
it
ramala
or
one
of
the
girls
i
wondered
or
was
it
just
my
paranoia
keep
walking
i
told
myself
lose
yourself
in
the
snow
the
only
way
they
can
stop
you
from
exposing
this
racket
now
is
to
kill
you
when
i
got
back
to
my
car
i
gazed
up
at
the
imposing
turrets
of
quetzal
manor
one
last
time
wishing
there
was
enough
light
to
film
them
and
collected
my
thoughts
was
the
story
about
the
babies
being
orphans
or
abandoned
children
or
whatever
really
true
i
believe
it
not
for
a
minute
but
as
carly
grove
said
alex
goddard
could
make
it
happen
the
problem
for
me
was
he
would
tell
me
where
he
got
the
children
and
nobody
i
talked
to
so
far
seemed
to
want
to
know
not
really
i
wanted
to
know
chapter
thirteen
in
moments
i
was
heading
down
the
snowy
drive
south
toward
my
home
which
had
been
hopefully
put
back
together
i
pushed
the
pace
mesmerized
by
the
snow
and
tried
to
decide
what
to
do
next
the
thug
ramos
had
stolen
some
interview
footage
from
me
but
now
i
had
a
tape
of
something
a
lot
more
interesting
when
i
pulled
into
my
street
the
time
was
just
past
eleven
and
i
was
thinking
about
calling
lou
or
steve
or
both
but
then
i
saw
something
odd
a
woman
was
walking
down
the
steps
from
the
lobby
of
my
building
a
woman
i
recognized
from
somewhere
her
hair
was
tangled
and
she
was
wearing
black
jeans
and
a
black
sweater
it
took
a
second
before
i
finally
processed
the
fact
it
was
carly
grove
and
she
seemed
frantic
i
assumed
she
come
in
a
cab
but
she
had
my
home
phone
number
so
why
would
she
come
over
if
i
answer
new
yorkers
do
just
drop
in
a
social
maybe
the
reason
had
something
to
do
with
how
she
looked
i
felt
like
i
was
seeing
a
specter
thank
god
you
here
she
blurted
out
striding
up
she
was
actually
shaking
and
i
could
tell
she
been
crying
nothing
like
the
gutsy
woman
i
seen
a
few
days
earlier
i
kept
getting
your
machine
but
i
thought
maybe
you
were
hiding
i
looked
at
her
and
forgot
all
about
my
own
issues
it
was
hard
to
remember
ever
seeing
a
human
being
in
such
distress
except
for
sarah
why
would
i
be
hiding
i
was
taking
out
the
betacam
bag
and
closing
my
car
door
hoping
to
seem
normal
and
professional
they
called
me
about
six
tonight
children
of
light
she
could
barely
get
the
words
out
they
seen
my
interview
with
you
how
did
they
get
it
i
looked
down
at
the
snowy
make
that
slushy
street
and
felt
a
chill
go
through
me
followed
immediately
by
anger
ramos
that
bastard
they
somebody
took
a
copy
this
morning
stated
like
that
it
sounded
pretty
lame
i
so
sorry
he
threatened
kevin
he
actually
said
if
i
signed
a
release
to
let
you
use
the
film
my
child
would
with
an
accident
and
then
he
said
something
about
you
that
your
own
who
who
called
you
did
he
tell
you
his
he
would
give
a
name
just
some
man
he
had
a
foreign
accent
she
threw
her
arms
around
me
and
i
hugged
her
back
as
best
i
could
where
kevin
now
i
was
so
concerned
about
carly
that
i
repressed
the
information
that
he
also
mentioned
me
marcy
was
there
so
i
told
her
to
take
him
with
her
to
her
place
in
the
bronx
where
she
lives
carly
was
still
trembling
as
she
loosened
her
grip
on
me
i
called
a
car
service
to
drive
them
up
well
come
on
in
let
talk
truthfully
i
was
sure
how
much
i
wanted
to
tell
her
about
what
i
just
seen
at
quetzal
manor
it
would
probably
just
distress
her
more
where
had
kevin
come
from
did
i
really
want
to
him
in
her
eyes
as
i
led
her
through
the
lobby
hoping
to
appear
composed
patrick
mooney
greeted
us
announcing
that
his
sister
rosalyn
had
been
gone
for
an
hour
and
that
she
appreciated
my
memorable
tip
the
place
looked
like
nothing
had
happened
and
carly
immediately
collapsed
onto
my
couch
i
had
told
her
my
apartment
had
been
tossed
along
with
the
robbery
and
thanks
to
rosalyn
i
need
to
in
fact
it
actually
looked
cleaner
than
it
had
in
months
maybe
i
thought
i
should
reprioritize
my
life
and
hire
her
more
often
then
i
got
a
glass
of
water
for
carly
and
sat
down
next
to
her
i
really
sorry
i
began
deeply
meaning
it
if
i
known
all
this
was
going
to
happen
i
never
it
not
your
fault
she
took
a
long
drink
i
had
bothered
with
ice
and
i
immediately
felt
i
been
inhospitable
kind
of
a
vagrant
minor
concern
considering
then
she
went
on
i
guess
i
knew
down
deep
i
should
have
given
you
that
interview
but
i
wanted
the
world
to
know
about
kevin
now
though
should
i
call
the
police
or
something
the
short
answer
to
that
was
yes
but
my
mind
was
already
skipping
on
to
a
different
topic
carly
do
you
know
where
kevin
came
from
really
came
from
did
you
ever
actually
try
to
find
out
she
sighed
and
took
another
sip
i
told
you
i
do
care
when
they
brought
him
all
pink
and
helpless
i
just
who
brought
him
i
interrupted
well
i
been
up
there
the
day
before
signing
all
the
papers
i
was
supposed
to
go
up
that
day
but
then
somebody
called
and
said
one
of
the
girls
who
was
staying
in
the
clinic
or
whatever
it
is
was
bringing
him
to
me
so
do
come
you
saying
one
of
the
girls
yeah
she
looked
wistful
for
a
moment
as
though
remembering
then
she
just
showed
up
looked
like
some
blond
college
dropout
i
guess
a
little
more
fanfare
would
been
nice
but
marcy
was
there
to
help
me
and
that
was
it
that
the
last
contact
i
ever
had
with
children
of
light
she
shuddered
involuntarily
till
now
well
i
thought
the
last
thing
i
going
to
do
is
tell
her
about
what
i
just
saw
she
the
ideal
customer
for
alex
goddard
she
truly
does
want
to
know
details
carly
there
not
much
i
can
do
about
what
already
happened
but
i
can
try
to
keep
you
from
getting
into
any
more
trouble
why
do
you
call
them
in
the
morning
and
tell
them
you
yelled
at
me
and
rescinded
your
permission
for
applecore
to
use
the
film
and
say
promised
i
wo
you
threatened
to
sue
me
or
something
that
should
get
you
off
the
hook
you
really
think
so
her
look
brightened
slightly
yes
it
me
they
worried
about
not
you
i
represent
some
threat
to
them
because
of
the
film
i
making
just
bail
out
and
you
be
okay
thanks
i
did
get
the
feeling
that
all
they
really
want
she
took
another
drink
of
water
but
if
they
wanted
to
scare
me
they
doing
a
hell
of
a
good
job
well
then
why
not
take
kevin
and
go
away
for
a
couple
of
weeks
on
a
vacation
someplace
and
while
you
doing
that
i
going
to
have
a
with
alex
goddard
i
got
a
little
leverage
now
she
looked
at
me
what
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
could
tell
her
about
my
videotape
of
his
baby
cache
without
explaining
a
lot
more
about
children
of
light
than
i
thought
she
wanted
to
hear
do
you
think
the
less
you
know
the
better
i
said
taking
her
hand
i
caused
you
enough
trouble
already
no
i
caused
myself
trouble
she
was
getting
up
can
i
use
your
bathroom
sure
i
pointed
the
way
while
she
was
gone
i
went
to
the
kitchen
and
surveyed
it
checking
the
cabinets
again
the
place
was
cleaner
than
it
had
been
in
ages
the
look
of
it
momentarily
bucked
me
up
when
carly
came
back
she
hugged
me
and
then
announced
she
wanted
to
go
check
on
kevin
i
do
what
you
said
about
calling
them
she
concluded
reaching
for
her
bag
i
think
you
right
that
ought
to
get
them
off
my
case
at
least
for
the
moment
as
for
the
long
run
carly
i
said
taking
her
hand
again
we
get
through
this
just
trust
me
we
hugged
one
more
time
and
then
she
was
gone
i
took
the
moment
to
the
door
and
then
collapsed
on
the
couch
what
should
be
my
next
move
i
closed
my
eyes
and
tried
to
review
all
the
insidious
things
that
had
happened
in
the
last
hours
the
illegal
drugs
the
and
theft
of
my
film
the
suspicious
nursery
of
children
of
light
the
threats
to
carly
then
it
finally
came
back
that
she
mentioned
ramos
saying
something
about
me
by
now
i
was
getting
used
to
being
threatened
by
the
man
so
one
more
time
was
hardly
news
but
i
wished
i
asked
her
the
specifics
that
was
when
i
roused
myself
and
reached
for
the
phone
the
time
was
pushing
eleven
but
i
still
wanted
to
check
in
on
sarah
see
how
she
was
doing
had
she
come
back
to
reality
after
i
left
i
was
listening
to
the
phone
ring
my
mind
drifting
to
thoughts
of
how
to
gently
ask
lou
about
her
when
i
realized
nobody
was
picking
up
what
going
on
i
wondered
immediately
coming
alert
reilly
had
probably
gone
home
for
the
day
but
no
way
would
lou
be
in
bed
before
midnight
he
always
had
trouble
settling
into
sleep
maybe
i
then
hoped
i
just
dialed
the
wrong
number
but
when
i
tried
again
still
no
answer
i
clicked
off
the
phone
and
felt
a
wave
of
concern
if
colonel
jose
alvino
ramos
could
find
out
i
was
making
a
movie
and
then
find
out
where
i
lived
he
sure
as
hell
could
locate
my
extended
family
was
that
what
he
meant
when
he
mentioned
me
to
carly
i
grabbed
the
set
of
lou
keys
i
had
stored
in
my
bedroom
desk
drawer
and
flew
out
the
door
the
streets
were
plastered
with
a
grimy
veneer
of
city
snow
melting
fast
but
i
pushed
the
limits
of
safety
and
ran
a
couple
of
lights
since
the
traffic
was
spotty
there
was
a
parking
space
just
across
the
street
from
lou
building
and
as
i
pulled
in
i
looked
over
at
his
windows
through
the
curtains
i
could
tell
a
dim
light
was
on
probably
coming
from
sarah
bedroom
the
front
room
however
was
dark
my
pulse
was
pounding
as
i
raced
up
the
steps
to
the
street
door
i
thought
about
pushing
his
bell
but
i
did
have
the
patience
instead
i
just
fumbled
with
the
key
set
till
i
found
the
biggest
one
and
shoved
it
into
the
lock
the
building
had
no
lobby
just
a
row
of
stairs
leading
up
to
the
next
floor
with
lou
own
door
set
off
to
the
left
i
shoved
his
medeco
key
into
the
deadlock
and
pushed
it
open
the
room
was
who
said
a
startled
voice
and
i
knew
it
was
lou
somewhere
in
the
direction
of
the
couch
i
clicked
on
the
light
switch
and
saw
him
lying
on
the
floor
leaning
against
the
couch
blood
everywhere
his
eyes
in
shock
my
god
what
happened
i
afraid
to
move
the
phone
was
ringing
and
i
figured
it
was
you
but
i
did
dare
get
up
knowing
you
you
come
over
if
i
answer
he
was
holding
his
side
as
he
looked
at
me
morgy
gone
at
first
what
he
said
did
sink
in
as
i
bent
over
him
the
right
side
of
his
shirt
just
above
his
belt
was
soaked
in
blood
taking
care
i
unbuttoned
it
and
saw
an
open
cut
that
looked
as
though
he
been
stabbed
with
a
knife
it
also
appeared
to
be
reasonably
superficial
as
though
a
thin
blade
had
pierced
through
a
couple
of
layers
of
tread
on
his
ample
spare
tire
but
it
was
bleeding
still
enough
to
make
it
look
worse
than
it
probably
was
however
if
it
happened
to
me
doubtless
be
in
shock
too
i
got
up
went
to
the
bathroom
and
pulled
two
towels
off
the
rack
then
doused
water
over
one
and
came
back
do
move
i
going
to
pull
your
shirt
away
and
try
to
clean
you
up
see
how
bad
it
is
he
just
groaned
and
stared
at
the
ceiling
as
i
was
swabbing
his
side
what
he
said
finally
registered
did
you
say
i
dropped
the
towels
and
ran
into
the
bedroom
it
was
empty
the
bed
rumpled
and
beige
sheets
on
the
floor
no
i
turned
and
feeling
a
hit
of
nausea
hurried
back
to
his
side
what
happened
did
fat
hispanic
guy
spic
bastard
he
had
a
couple
of
young
punks
with
him
reilly
had
just
left
and
i
went
to
the
door
thinking
it
was
probably
you
ringing
my
bell
he
flashed
a
knife
and
they
shoved
their
way
in
then
one
of
his
thugs
went
into
the
bedroom
and
carried
her
out
when
i
tried
to
stop
them
the
sob
knifed
me
i
guess
i
swooned
cause
the
next
thing
i
remember
is
waking
up
here
on
the
floor
it
sounded
garbled
and
probably
did
occur
as
quickly
as
he
thought
but
i
knew
immediately
what
had
happened
ramos
of
course
that
who
it
was
had
come
to
take
sarah
it
was
his
one
sure
way
to
stop
me
from
mentioning
children
of
light
in
my
film
she
was
a
hostage
my
first
instinct
was
to
kill
him
what
else
can
you
remember
i
was
already
dialing
time
to
get
an
ambulance
and
after
that
the
cops
after
about
ten
rings
i
got
somebody
and
following
an
explanation
that
was
longer
than
it
needed
to
be
a
woman
with
a
southern
accent
told
me
the
medics
would
be
there
in
fifteen
minutes
i
took
another
look
at
lou
and
ordered
them
to
hurry
then
hung
up
i
was
going
to
call
the
police
next
but
first
i
needed
to
hear
exactly
what
had
happened
before
he
got
quarantined
in
some
emergency
room
his
eyes
were
glazing
over
again
as
shock
and
blood
loss
started
to
catch
up
with
him
clearly
he
would
pull
through
but
right
now
sitting
there
in
a
pool
of
blood
he
could
have
been
at
death
door
look
at
that
he
was
pointing
his
rationality
beginning
to
fail
for
a
second
i
did
realize
what
he
meant
but
then
i
saw
a
fax
lying
beside
the
phone
i
picked
it
up
the
time
on
it
was
and
it
was
from
somebody
named
john
williams
then
i
remembered
that
the
fbi
computer
whiz
he
talked
about
the
other
day
at
the
hospital
after
we
deconstructed
sarah
waterlogged
passport
there
was
no
message
just
a
sheet
with
a
date
two
years
old
and
a
list
of
names
accompanied
by
numbers
and
a
capital
letter
then
i
noticed
the
letterhead
of
aviateca
the
guatemalan
national
airline
and
it
dawned
on
me
i
was
looking
at
a
flight
manifest
i
scanned
down
the
page
and
then
i
saw
it
sarah
crenshaw
williams
found
her
i
thought
and
she
was
traveling
first
class
what
caught
my
eye
next
was
the
name
of
the
person
sitting
in
the
seat
right
next
to
hers
godford
probably
a
computer
misprint
or
maybe
it
was
the
name
he
used
when
he
traveled
so
if
it
was
him
which
it
surely
was
the
bastard
did
even
try
to
hide
it
i
just
stood
there
thinking
maybe
you
get
one
coincidence
in
life
and
if
so
this
must
be
mine
sarah
and
i
had
both
found
alex
goddard
or
he
found
us
other
women
came
and
went
through
quetzal
manor
but
we
were
different
she
escaped
from
him
half
dead
but
now
he
sent
ramos
to
bring
her
back
it
was
the
one
way
he
could
be
sure
to
keep
me
under
his
control
but
again
why
was
it
just
to
stop
my
film
or
was
there
more
to
the
story
morgy
lou
groaned
that
son
of
a
bitch
took
her
tonight
i
just
know
it
that
was
my
conclusion
precisely
though
i
had
been
planning
to
say
it
to
him
at
least
not
yet
how
can
you
be
so
sure
something
they
said
i
did
quite
catch
it
but
it
sounded
like
wants
you
back
then
some
word
it
sounded
like
or
something
i
stared
at
him
a
second
trying
to
remember
where
i
heard
that
before
then
it
clicked
in
that
was
the
last
thing
sarah
had
said
she
whispered
that
word
when
i
was
putting
her
to
bed
what
could
she
have
been
talking
about
he
wheezed
and
i
went
back
to
him
and
pressed
the
towel
against
his
side
the
bleeding
was
about
stemmed
but
he
was
definitely
due
for
a
hospital
stay
a
siren
was
sounding
down
the
street
probably
the
ambulance
thank
god
i
thought
now
it
time
to
call
the
police
then
i
noticed
he
was
crying
what
was
that
about
morgy
they
did
actually
kidnap
her
you
see
she
what
i
guess
i
was
trying
to
take
it
in
what
do
you
mean
know
what
she
said
sarah
he
choked
for
a
second
then
continued
she
said
i
want
to
go
back
chapter
fourteen
before
i
could
ask
him
what
the
hell
he
was
talking
about
the
medics
were
ringing
the
doorbell
they
strode
in
with
a
gurney
also
rolling
a
portable
plasma
iv
young
guys
who
looked
like
they
be
more
at
home
at
a
garden
hockey
game
followed
immediately
by
two
uniformed
policemen
actually
policewomen
one
short
and
heavy
with
reddish
hair
the
other
a
wiry
young
hispanic
i
found
out
that
ambulances
called
out
for
stabbing
or
gunshot
wounds
automatically
get
a
cop
escort
in
less
than
three
minutes
lou
was
in
the
ambulance
and
on
his
way
to
vincent
emergency
room
i
rode
in
the
backseat
of
the
squad
car
as
we
followed
them
and
tried
to
explain
what
little
i
knew
of
what
had
happened
it
turned
out
to
be
an
education
in
the
mindless
sticking
points
of
the
law
long
story
short
the
fact
that
i
had
reported
the
burglary
of
my
apartment
that
very
same
day
immediately
cast
doubt
on
my
seriousness
as
a
citizen
i
had
no
proof
the
unreported
burglary
of
my
apartment
if
indeed
such
had
actually
occurred
was
by
some
guatemalan
military
attache
named
jose
alvino
ramos
since
lou
had
never
seen
colonel
ramos
before
tonight
he
could
possibly
identify
him
as
that
burglar
either
accusing
diplomats
of
a
crime
without
ironclad
proof
was
frowned
on
downtown
and
when
i
stupidly
repeated
what
lou
had
said
about
sarah
last
words
well
he
was
going
to
tell
them
sooner
or
later
it
would
just
come
bubbling
out
at
some
point
the
whole
case
that
she
was
kidnapped
went
into
revision
mode
by
the
time
we
got
to
the
hospital
i
was
getting
questions
that
seemed
to
imply
that
maybe
it
was
all
a
domestic
affair
like
most
of
their
calls
some
chick
who
run
away
once
and
got
brought
back
and
then
still
unstable
and
crazy
decided
to
knife
her
own
dad
and
disappear
again
now
he
was
understandably
covering
for
her
happened
more
than
you
think
i
kept
stressing
that
lou
was
former
fbi
and
not
the
sort
to
invent
such
a
whopper
but
this
was
listened
to
in
skeptical
silence
if
it
was
a
kidnapping
they
then
wondered
aloud
what
was
the
motive
and
where
were
the
demands
of
the
perpetrators
i
was
ready
to
start
yelling
at
them
by
the
time
we
parked
in
the
seventh
avenue
driveway
of
the
emergency
room
at
vincent
they
next
made
me
cool
my
heels
in
the
waiting
room
while
they
went
back
to
interrogate
lou
they
were
with
him
for
almost
an
hour
then
came
back
to
where
i
was
and
asked
me
to
read
and
sign
the
report
they
written
a
troubled
girl
who
had
emerged
from
a
coma
and
apparently
was
suffering
bouts
of
had
disappeared
and
her
father
had
been
stabbed
but
not
seriously
he
was
the
only
witness
to
the
incident
and
claimed
she
been
kidnapped
however
the
girl
had
run
away
once
previously
and
there
was
no
physical
evidence
she
been
taken
against
her
will
in
fact
her
father
admitted
she
had
declared
just
the
opposite
the
whole
incident
would
be
investigated
further
after
he
came
downtown
and
made
a
complete
statement
i
not
going
to
sign
this
i
handed
it
back
fuming
is
there
anything
here
that
not
factually
correct
the
hispanic
cop
was
looking
me
straight
in
the
eye
her
expression
cold
as
alaska
the
question
made
me
seethe
sarah
was
probably
already
on
her
way
out
of
the
country
and
here
i
was
trying
to
reason
with
two
women
who
practically
thought
she
was
the
criminal
but
i
knew
a
lost
cause
when
i
saw
one
forget
about
it
i
want
to
see
lou
an
intern
was
coming
out
and
i
snagged
him
announced
i
was
next
of
kin
to
a
patient
and
demanded
to
be
taken
through
the
official
door
and
into
the
back
at
that
moment
the
stout
cop
radio
crackled
they
were
being
summoned
to
a
christopher
street
gay
bar
where
somebody
had
just
been
knifed
in
a
back
room
she
looked
at
me
as
though
to
say
this
sounds
like
a
real
crime
and
then
they
hurried
out
for
their
squad
car
christ
the
intern
a
young
black
guy
led
me
past
a
row
of
gurneys
and
into
a
private
room
at
the
rear
of
the
huge
space
lou
was
bandaged
all
around
his
chest
and
hooked
up
to
an
iv
and
a
monitor
he
looked
better
but
i
was
sure
he
be
ready
for
what
i
was
about
to
tell
him
hey
how
you
feeling
i
asked
as
i
walked
in
trying
to
seem
upbeat
fucking
cops
he
was
boiling
his
face
actually
red
where
do
they
get
them
these
days
mcdonald
rejects
easy
do
get
your
blood
pressure
up
i
reached
over
and
touched
his
brow
it
felt
like
he
had
a
mild
temperature
let
all
just
calm
down
and
try
to
think
rationally
yeah
i
thinking
rationally
you
saw
that
fax
i
got
from
williams
you
think
that
was
alex
goddard
seated
next
to
her
right
who
else
when
she
was
in
her
moonbeam
phase
she
must
have
heard
about
him
and
gone
up
there
and
ended
up
in
his
clutches
but
why
did
she
let
him
take
her
down
to
he
told
me
he
has
a
clinic
in
central
america
he
called
it
place
of
miracles
and
then
colonel
ramos
shows
up
part
of
the
guatemalan
diplomatic
corps
put
two
and
two
together
that
got
to
be
where
they
taking
her
who
knows
but
i
going
to
get
the
boys
downtown
to
put
out
a
apb
nationwide
gerry
do
it
for
me
if
i
ask
fuck
new
york
finest
they
ai
gon
na
do
crap
anyway
i
listened
wondering
how
to
impress
my
bright
idea
upon
him
the
chances
were
ramos
was
taking
sarah
back
to
guatemala
probably
right
this
minute
for
some
kind
of
unfinished
business
or
just
to
hold
her
there
as
an
insurance
policy
that
children
of
light
would
never
be
mentioned
in
my
picture
i
seriously
doubt
a
alert
is
going
to
do
any
good
lou
because
i
seriously
doubt
she
going
to
be
walking
the
streets
of
this
country
that
bastard
ramos
is
taking
her
where
he
knows
he
can
hide
her
you
mean
jesus
he
stared
at
me
as
though
the
idea
had
never
crossed
his
mind
i
think
he
just
repressed
it
what
are
we
going
to
the
only
thing
we
can
do
i
going
down
there
i
going
to
go
straight
down
there
and
locate
alex
goddard
that
an
exceptionally
lousy
thought
process
his
voice
seemed
to
be
coming
from
a
great
distance
why
give
me
one
good
reason
why
you
think
the
police
down
there
are
going
to
bring
charges
against
a
colonel
i
really
could
have
used
some
encouragement
it
the
only
way
morgan
you
always
been
he
sighed
and
then
winced
ever
since
you
were
a
kid
i
worried
about
you
then
and
i
worried
about
you
now
i
do
want
you
to
go
down
there
and
get
into
trouble
because
believe
me
that
a
seriously
wrong
place
to
get
crossways
with
the
pricks
who
make
the
rules
you
do
know
your
way
around
that
third
world
craphole
would
be
that
hard
to
end
up
a
statistic
we
can
alert
the
embassy
have
them
start
looking
for
her
listen
there
a
lot
more
going
on
between
alex
goddard
and
me
than
you
know
this
was
definitely
not
the
time
to
tell
him
about
the
babies
or
about
carly
and
the
threats
trust
me
i
going
down
there
in
the
morning
if
i
can
who
knows
sarah
and
ramos
might
even
be
on
the
same
plane
as
i
was
finishing
that
pronouncement
two
nurses
came
in
rolling
a
gurney
and
announced
that
his
room
was
ready
then
they
gave
him
a
sedative
was
i
being
irrational
the
thing
was
though
what
would
you
do
i
was
absolutely
sure
ramos
had
taken
her
so
it
was
obvious
that
was
where
he
would
go
next
he
was
a
diplomat
apparently
so
he
could
easily
fudge
the
passport
formalities
as
the
nurses
were
helping
lou
onto
the
gurney
i
stood
there
holding
his
hand
and
thinking
about
what
lay
ahead
steve
was
in
belize
and
maybe
not
even
reachable
but
i
decided
to
start
by
giving
him
a
call
the
minute
i
got
home
then
a
wasp
with
dark
hair
slightly
balding
strode
in
the
room
the
photo
id
on
his
chest
read
m
summers
so
how
the
patient
he
enquired
cheerily
ignoring
me
as
he
immediately
began
checking
the
chart
at
the
foot
of
lou
bed
felt
better
lou
said
not
being
taken
in
by
his
pro
forma
cheer
well
we
going
to
make
sure
you
get
a
good
night
rest
summers
finished
with
the
chart
and
started
taking
his
pulse
left
of
it
how
long
am
i
going
to
be
in
here
doc
lou
asked
flinching
as
the
nurses
removed
the
iv
stuck
in
his
arm
a
couple
of
days
for
observation
to
make
sure
there
no
complications
he
smiled
again
you
a
lucky
man
crenshaw
just
a
superficial
cut
but
we
do
want
you
out
playing
handball
for
a
few
days
he
turned
and
gave
me
a
conspiratorial
wink
then
glanced
back
okay
up
we
go
can
i
come
with
him
i
asked
not
optimistic
but
hoping
the
doctor
looked
genuinely
contrite
i
really
sorry
but
he
going
to
be
fine
and
visiting
hours
are
long
past
you
can
call
in
the
morning
and
you
can
come
up
anytime
after
two
tomorrow
let
let
him
get
some
rest
now
i
walked
around
and
took
lou
hand
hot
and
fevered
feeling
so
agitated
do
think
about
anything
tonight
okay
worrying
wo
help
just
get
some
sleep
i
going
to
find
her
i
promise
you
do
he
mumbled
some
words
but
i
think
the
sedative
the
nurses
had
given
him
was
seriously
starting
to
kick
look
you
can
call
down
to
federal
plaza
tomorrow
see
what
they
can
do
in
the
meantime
let
me
follow
my
nose
he
tried
to
answer
but
he
was
too
far
gone
i
then
watched
wistfully
as
he
disappeared
down
the
sterile
alley
of
beds
after
i
stopped
by
the
desk
and
helped
them
fill
out
the
insurance
forms
i
caught
a
cab
downtown
to
retrieve
my
toyota
the
time
was
now
in
the
morning
but
i
still
had
plenty
to
do
when
i
got
home
the
first
thing
i
did
after
i
walked
in
the
door
was
grab
a
phone
book
and
call
american
airlines
they
had
a
flight
in
the
morning
at
i
gave
them
my
credit
card
specifics
and
made
a
reservation
i
no
longer
thought
that
alex
goddard
children
of
light
and
its
guatemalan
accomplices
were
merely
doing
something
shady
my
hunch
now
was
that
it
was
completely
illegal
they
were
getting
hundreds
of
white
babies
in
some
way
that
could
bear
the
light
of
day
and
they
were
prepared
to
do
whatever
it
took
to
prevent
me
from
highlighting
them
in
my
film
and
with
the
army
involved
and
now
sarah
taken
their
game
was
beginning
to
feel
more
and
more
like
kidnapping
they
certainly
knew
how
sarah
had
become
a
pawn
and
all
because
of
me
i
almost
wondered
if
i
been
unconsciously
led
to
him
by
her
though
that
was
impossible
whatever
had
happened
the
remorse
i
now
felt
was
overpowering
it
was
in
fact
an
intensified
version
of
the
guilt
that
had
dogged
me
for
the
past
fifteen
years
the
horrible
feeling
i
somehow
let
her
down
not
done
enough
for
her
i
could
have
flown
back
for
her
high
school
graduation
but
i
was
cramming
for
grad
school
finals
and
did
take
the
time
things
like
that
which
looking
back
seemed
terribly
selfish
and
now
i
brought
this
on
her
god
okay
i
thought
glancing
at
the
clock
time
to
start
making
it
up
to
her
screw
up
your
courage
and
wake
steve
the
problem
was
lou
had
been
right
about
one
thing
it
been
years
since
i
been
to
guatemala
and
i
was
sure
i
knew
beans
about
how
things
operated
down
there
these
days
i
was
high
on
motivation
and
only
in
the
area
of
modus
operandi
i
needed
steve
help
in
plying
the
tricky
waters
of
that
part
of
the
planet
he
was
busy
but
this
was
definitely
us
against
the
world
time
so
maybe
he
could
drive
over
to
guatemala
city
and
help
i
picked
up
the
phone
again
and
punched
in
the
number
of
his
hotel
in
belize
city
which
seemed
to
be
embedded
permanently
in
my
brain
that
wonderful
accent
at
the
desk
mon
and
then
they
were
ringing
his
room
i
had
no
reason
on
earth
to
assume
he
would
be
there
but
the
click
the
voice
it
was
him
sorry
to
call
so
late
love
you
said
you
missed
me
so
i
decided
to
find
out
if
it
true
your
coming
attraction
is
about
to
arrive
i
guess
i
was
trying
to
keep
it
flip
after
our
talk
that
morning
i
was
entirely
sure
where
we
stood
anymore
who
morgy
is
that
you
god
it
two
are
you
okay
then
he
started
coming
around
processing
what
i
said
you
coming
honey
that
great
as
i
noted
before
he
always
knew
how
to
give
a
good
reading
sound
sincere
no
matter
what
the
occasion
actually
i
just
made
a
plane
reservation
and
i
going
to
be
in
guatemala
city
tomorrow
just
after
noon
i
hesitated
then
thought
why
beat
around
the
bush
care
to
meet
me
there
that
terrific
he
declared
coming
fully
awake
but
why
do
you
just
come
to
belize
city
ca
you
get
flight
it
actually
not
nearly
as
wild
here
as
the
travel
books
well
i
look
i
rather
not
talk
about
this
on
the
phone
but
do
you
think
you
could
get
free
and
drive
over
i
really
could
use
your
help
i
got
a
situation
well
he
paused
i
could
be
there
by
late
tomorrow
assuming
my
rented
jeep
still
operates
after
last
week
and
the
roads
totally
disintegrated
where
you
going
to
be
staying
i
do
know
got
any
suggestions
i
want
to
keep
out
of
the
limelight
then
try
the
camino
real
it
like
a
holiday
inn
with
plastic
palm
trees
definitely
low
maintenance
and
low
profile
hang
on
i
get
you
the
number
which
he
did
though
i
could
hear
him
stumbling
around
the
room
in
the
dark
then
he
continued
but
listen
here
the
bad
news
i
got
to
be
back
here
day
after
tomorrow
i
just
got
a
special
permit
to
do
some
night
shooting
in
the
jaguar
preserve
down
by
victoria
peak
you
remember
the
rain
forest
i
told
you
about
but
it
only
good
for
one
night
and
i
hear
rumors
there
an
hurricane
forming
in
the
caribbean
which
means
i
got
to
stick
to
schedule
after
that
though
i
free
again
we
work
it
out
i
was
thrilled
he
would
just
drop
everything
and
come
maybe
we
were
over
the
rough
spot
about
the
baby
he
did
bring
that
up
and
i
did
either
instead
we
killed
a
few
minutes
and
then
i
let
him
go
back
to
sleep
i
wanted
to
say
i
love
you
but
i
did
want
to
push
my
luck
after
that
i
called
the
hotel
he
recommended
the
exchange
was
more
spanish
than
english
but
they
had
a
room
apparently
lots
of
rooms
next
i
rang
paula
marks
even
though
it
was
terribly
late
she
must
have
had
the
phones
off
but
i
left
a
message
telling
her
to
be
careful
with
a
postscript
that
i
explain
everything
later
just
stick
close
to
home
finally
i
called
david
voice
mail
up
at
applecore
i
told
him
i
had
a
personal
crisis
and
was
going
to
guatemala
city
i
try
to
be
back
by
the
end
of
the
week
hell
or
high
water
but
no
guarantees
and
if
he
touched
so
much
as
a
frame
of
my
work
print
while
i
was
gone
personally
strangle
him
i
do
remember
much
of
what
happened
next
i
basically
went
on
autopilot
it
as
though
i
dropped
into
a
trance
totally
focused
i
packed
my
passport
a
good
business
suit
the
tailored
blue
one
and
also
a
set
of
separates
easy
to
roll
and
cram
in
finally
a
couple
of
pairs
of
good
clean
jeans
a
few
toiletries
and
then
thinking
ahead
i
also
threw
in
my
yellow
plastic
flashlight
i
almost
always
over
pack
but
not
this
time
oh
and
one
other
thing
for
airplane
reading
i
grabbed
a
lonely
planet
guide
to
central
america
that
steve
had
left
behind
i
guess
he
figured
he
was
at
the
stage
of
life
to
start
writing
them
not
reading
them
that
turned
out
to
be
very
helpful
particularly
the
map
of
guatemala
city
and
the
northern
peten
rain
forest
i
then
collapsed
and
images
of
sarah
emaciated
face
haunting
my
consciousness
caught
a
couple
of
hours
sleep
the
next
thing
i
knew
it
was
and
i
was
settling
into
window
seat
on
american
airlines
flight
next
to
a
executive
busy
ripping
articles
out
of
the
business
section
of
headed
for
guatemala
city
chapter
fifteen
for
once
in
my
life
i
took
my
time
getting
off
an
airplane
but
the
instant
i
felt
that
first
burst
of
humid
tropical
air
against
my
face
like
a
gush
from
a
sauna
i
found
myself
wondering
what
sarah
had
felt
the
moment
her
feet
first
touched
the
ground
of
guatemala
in
fact
decided
to
try
to
think
like
her
to
better
understand
why
she
might
want
to
come
back
truthfully
i
did
have
a
clue
but
first
things
first
not
knowing
whether
i
was
being
stalked
by
ramos
or
his
proxies
i
decided
the
idea
was
to
see
and
not
be
seen
which
actually
was
easier
than
i
expected
at
least
during
the
initial
stages
turned
out
the
of
homo
sapiens
blossoms
under
those
circumstances
ignore
thy
neighbor
goes
the
credo
i
just
buried
myself
in
the
crush
when
i
got
to
inmigracion
i
labored
through
the
formalities
as
all
countries
love
to
call
the
suspicious
looks
you
get
from
their
airport
bureaucrats
along
with
all
the
other
gringo
passengers
on
aa
flight
paranoid
i
might
be
arrested
on
the
spot
for
some
spurious
reason
the
purpose
of
my
visit
i
declared
was
tourism
just
a
nod
at
my
passport
and
a
stamp
which
looked
exactly
like
the
one
in
sarah
i
stared
at
it
and
felt
a
renewed
sense
of
purpose
in
fact
the
photo
in
my
passport
looked
more
than
a
little
like
her
maybe
i
thought
i
getting
carried
away
with
the
identity
issue
but
there
it
was
as
i
emerged
through
the
wide
glass
doors
of
the
arrival
area
which
fronted
out
onto
the
steps
leading
down
to
the
parking
lots
and
the
humidity
i
spotted
a
black
land
rover
with
tinted
windows
right
in
front
that
was
steve
once
told
me
a
vehicle
much
favored
by
the
notorious
guatemalan
military
secret
police
who
had
retired
the
cup
for
murderous
abuses
over
the
past
two
decades
then
two
men
with
latin
mustaches
and
nondescript
brown
shirts
began
getting
out
through
the
door
on
the
far
side
they
next
walked
around
to
the
terminal
side
of
the
car
and
glanced
up
the
steps
in
my
direction
as
though
looking
for
somebody
it
was
a
quick
survey
after
which
they
turned
back
and
nodded
to
the
vehicle
before
it
sped
away
what
that
about
am
i
imagining
things
already
by
the
time
i
reached
the
bottom
of
the
steps
i
was
being
besieged
by
clamoring
cabbies
so
it
was
difficult
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
two
men
who
were
now
walking
off
to
the
side
of
the
main
commotion
toward
a
shady
grove
of
palms
at
the
end
of
the
arrival
drive
lighting
cigarettes
get
out
of
here
whether
you
fantasizing
or
not
the
thing
to
do
is
grab
an
unsuspecting
cab
and
get
going
i
strolled
toward
the
other
end
of
the
long
row
of
concrete
steps
till
i
reached
an
area
where
cabs
were
parked
more
drivers
lurking
in
wait
they
all
looked
the
same
way
most
cabbies
in
third
world
lands
look
shabby
clothes
with
cars
an
expression
in
their
eyes
somewhere
between
aggression
and
desperation
just
pick
one
whose
car
looks
like
it
might
actually
make
it
to
downtown
i
spotted
a
dark
blue
chevy
that
seemed
clean
and
well
maintained
its
driver
young
and
full
of
male
hormones
as
he
beckoned
me
to
his
vehicle
all
the
while
undressing
me
with
his
eyes
yep
he
was
definitely
my
guy
i
ambled
by
his
car
acting
as
though
i
was
ignoring
the
innuendos
of
his
pitch
then
i
bolted
for
the
back
door
opened
it
myself
since
he
was
too
startled
to
help
threw
in
my
piled
in
behind
them
and
yelled
let
go
rapido
as
we
sped
away
i
realized
his
greatest
surprise
was
that
i
raised
the
subject
of
price
at
that
point
it
was
the
last
thing
on
my
mind
i
looked
back
to
see
the
two
guys
from
the
black
land
rover
together
with
two
others
heading
for
a
car
that
had
been
right
in
front
had
i
been
right
after
all
we
made
a
turn
onto
the
highway
and
i
immediately
ordered
the
driver
to
take
a
service
road
that
led
off
toward
a
cluster
of
gas
stations
and
parking
lots
with
fences
i
figured
i
had
about
half
a
minute
of
lead
time
whatever
was
going
on
we
dodged
massive
potholes
and
the
loose
gravel
flew
but
then
we
reached
a
ramshackle
gas
station
and
i
ordered
him
to
pull
in
then
i
watched
the
line
of
traffic
speeding
by
on
the
main
highway
for
several
minutes
nobody
pulled
off
good
my
driver
finally
got
around
to
asking
where
i
wanted
to
go
and
as
calmly
as
i
could
i
told
him
the
palacio
nacional
with
that
he
gunned
his
engine
and
spun
out
jesus
despacio
por
okay
he
said
showing
off
his
english
as
he
donned
his
sunglasses
i
go
more
slow
no
problem
the
initial
destination
was
part
of
my
new
plan
hatched
while
i
was
on
the
plane
when
i
was
reading
my
guidebook
and
filling
out
my
entry
card
i
had
a
bright
idea
i
knew
exactly
how
i
wanted
to
begin
heading
into
town
the
time
now
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
i
leaned
back
in
the
seat
and
tried
to
absorb
the
view
to
get
a
feeling
for
where
i
was
we
first
traveled
through
the
suburban
fringes
the
heavily
guarded
luxurious
mansions
of
the
landholding
and
military
elite
the
one
percent
of
guatemala
who
own
percent
of
the
country
iron
fences
and
wide
expanses
of
lawn
protected
by
security
guarded
whimsical
architectural
conceits
topped
by
silver
satellite
dishes
a
wall
shielded
their
delicate
eyes
from
the
city
largest
makeshift
hovels
of
bamboo
and
rusted
tin
with
no
signs
of
water
or
drains
or
toilets
guatemala
city
as
steve
had
put
it
once
a
million
doomed
citizens
the
rich
and
the
poor
trapped
together
side
by
side
in
the
most
modern
capital
in
central
america
why
on
earth
had
sarah
decided
to
come
here
even
if
she
did
travel
with
the
mesmerizing
alex
goddard
it
was
hard
to
imagine
a
place
less
spiritual
could
she
feel
that
this
was
all
wrong
one
of
us
had
to
be
missing
something
major
fifteen
minutes
later
i
was
passing
through
the
fetid
atmosphere
of
downtown
which
seemed
to
be
another
world
guatemala
city
twin
soul
it
was
an
urban
hodgepodge
of
burger
king
mcdonald
discount
electronics
emporia
an
profusion
of
plastic
signs
filthy
parking
lots
rattletrap
buses
and
taxis
stalled
traffic
exhaust
fumes
thickened
the
air
and
everywhere
you
looked
teenage
guards
in
uniforms
loitered
in
front
of
stores
and
banks
with
shotguns
boys
so
green
and
you
think
twice
about
letting
one
of
them
park
your
car
but
there
they
were
weapons
at
the
ready
nervously
monitoring
passersby
who
were
they
defending
all
the
wealth
from
the
ragged
street
children
with
swollen
bellies
and
skin
disease
vending
single
cigarettes
from
open
packs
or
the
hordes
of
widows
and
orphans
beneficiaries
of
the
army
mayan
pacification
program
who
now
begged
for
centavos
or
plaintively
hawked
fruit
from
the
safety
of
the
shadows
my
destination
was
a
government
office
in
the
palacio
nacional
right
in
the
center
of
town
where
i
hoped
i
could
find
sarah
old
landing
card
the
record
of
when
tourists
arrived
and
departed
when
i
filled
mine
out
on
the
plane
i
realized
you
were
supposed
to
put
down
where
you
be
staying
in
guatemala
i
figured
the
best
way
to
locate
her
this
time
was
to
find
out
where
she
went
last
time
as
my
cab
pulled
up
in
front
a
black
land
rover
was
parked
in
a
prohibido
estacionarse
zone
by
the
front
steps
to
my
eyes
it
looked
like
the
same
one
i
seen
at
the
airport
shit
but
nobody
was
around
so
i
decided
maybe
i
was
just
being
paranoid
again
the
palacio
turned
out
to
be
a
mixture
of
moorish
and
faux
greek
architecture
with
a
facade
of
light
green
imitation
stone
that
gave
off
the
impression
of
a
large
rococo
wedding
cake
i
took
a
long
look
paid
off
the
driver
who
had
turned
out
to
be
very
nice
and
headed
in
it
was
after
all
a
public
building
open
to
tourist
gringos
nobody
in
the
lobby
appeared
to
take
any
particular
notice
of
me
so
after
going
through
their
very
serious
security
uniforms
and
guns
everywhere
i
checked
the
directory
it
turned
out
the
president
cabinet
ministers
and
high
military
officers
all
kept
offices
there
but
it
did
take
long
to
find
the
bureau
i
was
looking
for
going
down
the
hallway
on
the
third
floor
i
passed
by
the
sala
de
recepcion
a
vast
room
of
enormous
chandeliers
windows
and
a
massive
coat
of
arms
quite
a
place
but
not
my
destination
at
the
far
end
of
the
hallway
i
found
the
door
i
wanted
went
in
and
tried
out
the
spanish
question
i
been
practicing
in
the
cab
not
necessary
english
worked
fine
the
records
for
that
time
were
only
kept
on
paper
a
ladino
woman
declared
shrugging
her
nails
colored
a
brash
mauve
her
hair
a
burst
of
red
but
you
are
welcome
to
look
she
been
on
the
phone
chatting
in
spanish
but
she
quickly
hung
up
and
got
out
her
glasses
thanks
the
welcome
mat
was
obviously
a
little
thin
the
woman
was
trying
to
be
friendly
but
very
quickly
her
nervousness
began
to
come
through
we
always
glad
to
accommodate
americans
searching
for
friends
or
relatives
she
went
on
attempting
a
smile
some
of
your
american
press
has
been
printing
distortions
that
the
guatemalan
army
conspired
with
the
cia
to
cover
up
murders
it
a
total
lie
right
maybe
you
ought
to
see
some
of
the
photos
steve
has
of
the
maya
villages
up
in
the
mountains
the
search
took
an
hour
and
a
half
of
leafing
through
dusty
boxes
which
chafed
my
hands
raw
but
then
voila
there
it
was
the
crucial
piece
of
information
lou
had
missed
a
hastily
landing
card
for
an
american
with
the
name
sarah
crenshaw
i
stared
at
it
a
moment
feeling
a
glow
of
success
was
it
an
omen
it
was
definitely
her
she
even
dotted
an
i
with
a
smiley
face
one
of
her
personal
trademarks
then
i
looked
down
the
form
what
i
wanted
was
the
address
she
put
down
as
a
destination
in
guatemala
the
answer
ninos
del
mundo
peten
department
my
hopes
sank
great
that
was
like
saying
your
address
is
children
of
the
world
lost
somewhere
in
the
state
of
montana
the
home
address
was
equally
vague
just
new
york
so
much
for
the
high
level
of
curiosity
at
inmigracion
however
the
carbon
copy
of
the
landing
card
which
you
supposed
to
surrender
when
you
leave
was
not
stapled
to
it
the
way
it
was
on
all
the
others
in
the
box
naturally
since
she
left
in
a
medevac
plane
half
dead
what
does
this
mean
i
got
up
and
walked
over
to
the
woman
desk
carrying
the
card
mainly
i
just
wanted
to
get
a
rise
out
of
her
the
carbon
copy
is
missing
does
that
mean
she
could
still
be
here
red
alert
she
glanced
at
the
arrival
date
a
moment
and
her
eyes
froze
then
doubtless
with
visions
of
another
cia
scandal
looming
in
her
consciousness
she
brusquely
announced
that
the
office
was
getting
ready
to
close
for
the
day
you
have
to
pursue
any
further
inquiries
through
the
american
embassy
james
which
handles
all
matters
concerning
nationals
well
thanks
for
all
your
help
i
was
finally
getting
the
runaround
i
expected
all
along
i
guess
i
needed
her
to
care
and
it
was
obvious
she
did
okay
i
planned
to
go
to
the
embassy
anyway
maybe
they
could
tell
me
about
this
place
she
put
on
her
landing
card
could
it
be
the
local
name
for
alex
goddard
clinic
as
i
picked
up
my
things
i
thought
again
about
the
prospect
of
showing
my
face
on
the
streets
of
guatemala
city
would
there
be
more
loitering
men
in
grungy
brown
shirts
waiting
to
watch
my
every
move
more
black
land
rovers
as
i
marched
back
out
through
the
ornate
lobby
i
decided
not
to
let
my
imagination
get
too
active
it
was
now
late
afternoon
but
i
was
making
progress
i
also
was
thinking
about
steve
wondering
if
he
gotten
into
town
yet
probably
not
for
another
couple
of
hours
but
just
thinking
about
seeing
him
again
and
having
him
for
support
was
boosting
my
energy
a
short
cab
ride
later
i
arrived
at
the
embassy
of
the
united
states
of
america
a
concrete
fortress
on
reforma
avenue
guarded
by
yank
marines
with
heavy
automatic
weapons
when
i
explained
myself
to
the
pr
people
manning
the
reception
desk
including
my
brush
with
guatemalan
bureaucracy
they
told
me
to
check
with
the
internal
security
section
in
fact
if
you
looking
for
an
american
national
this
is
where
you
should
have
come
in
the
first
place
said
a
very
young
woman
with
a
business
suit
and
dark
hair
a
phone
call
from
here
works
wonders
at
the
palacio
nacional
i
had
no
proof
sarah
was
in
guatemala
yet
and
if
she
was
it
would
doubtless
be
under
a
different
name
what
more
telling
them
my
suspicion
that
she
been
kidnapped
by
a
high
official
and
brought
here
would
definitely
brand
me
as
a
conspiracy
theorist
so
for
now
all
i
could
really
hope
to
get
from
them
was
an
address
for
alex
clinic
someplace
to
start
where
and
what
was
ninos
del
mundo
apparently
the
woman
had
fully
understood
that
moments
later
a
thirtyish
male
attache
showed
up
looking
very
harried
he
also
could
have
been
president
of
the
local
young
republicans
with
a
cute
haircut
and
preppie
tie
knotted
perfectly
hi
i
mel
olberg
how
can
i
i
told
him
i
wanted
to
see
someone
who
was
responsible
for
the
records
of
missing
american
tourists
i
also
sensed
he
was
edgy
and
trying
to
get
it
over
with
fast
all
the
while
he
kept
checking
his
watch
only
half
listening
gee
i
really
wish
you
come
earlier
he
said
monday
afternoons
are
a
little
nuts
around
here
weekly
reports
due
and
all
and
it
getting
late
when
he
glanced
at
his
watch
again
making
sure
i
noticed
i
found
myself
wanting
to
yell
at
the
guy
i
mean
it
been
two
years
since
this
woman
you
looking
for
filled
out
a
landing
card
we
might
have
something
in
the
files
but
would
it
be
possible
for
you
to
come
back
tomorrow
no
it
will
not
be
possible
i
lied
i
got
a
plane
back
to
new
york
tomorrow
i
felt
my
frustration
rising
i
wanted
to
just
grab
him
and
shake
him
my
first
thought
was
to
tell
him
i
make
documentary
films
and
maybe
he
like
to
end
up
in
one
about
how
my
country
guatemala
city
embassy
did
care
about
its
citizens
but
then
i
decided
to
go
in
a
different
probably
more
productive
direction
just
for
five
minutes
i
declared
reaching
for
feigned
helplessness
well
let
me
call
upstairs
he
muttered
realizing
i
suppose
that
the
best
way
to
get
rid
of
me
was
to
kick
me
up
the
chain
of
command
and
see
if
morton
can
take
a
moment
to
meet
with
you
it
worked
the
next
thing
i
knew
i
was
in
the
office
of
a
diplomat
named
barry
morton
gray
temples
tailored
suit
rugged
face
of
a
heartthrob
who
plays
tennis
and
keeps
a
mistress
chief
information
officer
actually
i
do
remember
her
vaguely
morton
declared
flashing
me
his
professional
smile
the
crenshaw
girl
was
an
unfortunate
case
to
begin
with
anybody
who
overstays
their
visa
that
long
gets
us
in
a
lot
of
hot
water
with
the
locals
they
always
tend
to
blame
us
james
my
name
morgan
james
ms
james
another
of
those
smiles
frankly
i
do
know
what
to
tell
you
though
he
shrugged
exuding
helplessness
it
hard
to
keep
track
of
every
american
tourist
who
comes
and
goes
through
this
country
some
of
the
hippie
types
end
up
in
a
mountain
village
somewhere
gone
native
in
this
instance
as
i
recall
we
got
her
out
on
a
medevac
her
landing
card
gave
her
destination
as
someplace
called
del
mundo
up
to
the
peten
that
ring
a
bell
any
idea
how
i
could
find
it
niiios
del
mundo
he
glanced
up
quickly
that
a
new
one
on
me
he
been
fiddling
with
a
stack
of
papers
on
his
desk
giving
me
only
half
his
attention
but
he
abruptly
stopped
you
try
the
phone
book
like
i
said
it
in
the
peten
i
was
getting
the
definite
sense
he
wanted
to
get
rid
of
me
as
soon
as
possible
the
whole
scene
was
feeling
tense
and
off
my
understanding
is
that
mostly
rain
forest
do
they
even
have
phones
up
there
not
many
he
said
his
tone
starting
to
definitely
acquire
an
i
have
better
things
to
do
edge
that
was
when
he
focused
in
on
me
his
look
turning
protective
let
me
speak
candidly
james
strictly
off
the
record
down
here
people
have
been
known
to
just
for
asking
too
many
questions
curiosity
killed
the
cat
and
all
that
between
us
this
place
is
still
a
police
state
in
many
regards
you
want
my
advice
let
sleeping
dogs
lie
just
forget
about
this
crenshaw
girl
she
out
of
the
country
now
so
let
me
put
it
like
this
people
who
go
poking
around
here
are
just
asking
for
trouble
i
felt
a
ring
of
sincerity
in
his
voice
maybe
a
little
too
much
sincerity
why
was
he
so
worried
for
me
that
may
be
true
but
i
still
going
to
see
what
i
can
find
out
my
heart
is
pure
why
should
anybody
care
do
what
you
think
best
he
said
with
a
sigh
but
i
told
you
everything
we
know
which
i
afraid
is
actually
very
little
by
the
way
try
one
more
thing
on
him
i
thought
see
what
he
say
since
you
so
concerned
about
sarah
you
be
relieved
to
know
she
regained
consciousness
and
started
to
talk
there
seemed
no
point
in
telling
him
any
more
the
rest
was
all
still
speculation
that
stopped
him
cold
what
what
has
she
said
his
eyes
appeared
startled
in
the
glaring
light
of
the
office
fluorescents
at
long
last
i
had
his
undivided
attention
you
busy
i
smiled
at
him
i
do
want
to
bore
you
with
details
but
it
just
going
to
be
a
matter
of
time
before
she
remembers
exactly
what
happened
down
here
she
has
talked
about
it
yet
he
was
fiddling
with
an
ornate
letter
opener
an
onyx
jaguar
head
on
the
handle
she
getting
there
i
stared
back
at
him
trying
to
read
his
mood
we
may
soon
find
out
who
was
behind
whatever
happened
to
her
then
i
tried
a
long
shot
maybe
officialdom
here
had
something
to
do
with
it
let
me
tell
you
something
he
sighed
again
seeming
to
regain
his
composure
the
sovereign
state
of
guatemala
definitely
plays
by
its
own
rules
whenever
foreigners
down
here
meet
with
foul
play
officials
have
developed
a
consensus
over
the
years
that
sometimes
it
better
not
be
too
industrious
nobody
ever
sure
of
what
or
who
they
might
turn
up
the
meeting
was
definitely
ending
and
once
again
i
had
more
questions
than
answers
something
about
barry
morton
felt
wrong
but
i
quite
get
a
grip
on
what
it
was
one
thing
i
was
certain
of
he
knew
more
than
he
was
telling
me
why
was
that
as
i
was
exiting
through
his
outer
office
headed
for
the
swarming
streets
below
i
waved
to
his
secretary
a
stout
fiftyish
ladino
matron
with
defiantly
hair
a
hard
look
mitigated
somewhat
by
the
zircon
trim
on
her
thick
glasses
and
a
small
silver
pendant
nestled
on
her
ample
sweater
it
was
the
pendant
that
caught
my
eye
being
the
silver
face
of
a
cat
most
likely
the
local
jaguar
looked
just
like
the
ones
i
seen
i
was
staring
so
hard
i
almost
stumbled
over
a
chair
yes
it
was
definitely
like
those
i
remembered
from
kevin
and
rachel
the
only
difference
was
when
she
bent
over
to
reach
for
her
stapler
the
medallion
twisted
around
and
the
back
i
could
see
flashed
blank
silver
no
engraving
of
lines
and
dots
so
where
did
she
get
it
i
started
to
ask
her
but
decided
i
just
get
more
bs
runaround
then
i
had
another
thought
maybe
she
handled
a
lot
of
things
that
never
made
it
to
barry
morton
desk
the
do
waste
the
boss
valuable
time
kind
of
secretary
maybe
she
s
the
one
i
really
should
have
been
talking
to
the
kind
of
woman
who
takes
care
of
everything
while
the
senior
supervisor
is
at
long
lunches
she
looked
at
me
and
our
eyes
met
and
held
for
a
second
had
she
been
listening
in
on
my
chat
with
morton
did
she
know
something
i
ought
to
know
by
then
however
thoughts
of
steve
were
weighing
in
i
had
seen
him
in
three
and
a
half
months
and
i
was
realizing
that
was
about
my
limit
i
wanted
to
recapture
the
lost
time
our
being
together
was
going
to
make
everything
turn
out
right
clinging
to
that
thought
i
grabbed
a
cab
and
headed
for
my
hotel
and
a
hot
bath
chapter
sixteen
come
here
he
said
whoosh
there
he
was
he
strode
through
the
door
tan
safari
shirt
smelling
like
a
man
who
just
driven
hundreds
of
miles
through
central
america
in
an
open
jeep
i
wanted
to
undress
him
with
my
teeth
and
lick
off
the
sweat
brown
eyes
skin
tan
as
leather
he
threw
his
arms
around
me
and
i
felt
the
weight
of
the
world
slip
away
he
was
here
i
was
wearing
a
robe
fresh
from
the
tub
but
it
was
gone
in
a
second
steve
i
got
ta
say
knew
a
thing
or
two
about
the
bedroom
as
we
wound
ourselves
together
for
the
next
two
hours
i
had
a
refresher
course
in
how
much
id
missed
him
soul
and
body
his
taste
his
skin
his
touch
finally
we
were
both
so
exhausted
we
just
lay
there
bathed
in
sweat
spooned
together
on
the
sagging
bed
i
felt
so
good
in
years
it
was
like
another
world
god
i
missed
you
i
said
again
holding
him
closer
the
was
beginning
to
lose
ground
against
the
late
sun
but
i
did
care
after
my
solo
nightmare
of
the
last
two
days
i
was
remembering
what
it
was
like
to
be
a
couple
again
the
camino
real
by
the
way
turned
out
to
be
an
hideaway
with
budget
shag
carpeting
and
flaking
blue
walls
in
a
way
though
the
downtrodden
decor
actually
made
it
more
romantic
like
sneaked
off
to
a
garish
motel
for
a
twilight
rendezvous
i
finally
dragged
myself
up
and
got
us
a
bottle
of
water
then
leaning
against
the
rickety
headboard
i
recounted
an
abbreviated
version
of
what
had
happened
yesterday
after
we
first
talked
the
theft
of
my
film
and
then
lou
being
assaulted
and
sarah
taken
apparently
willingly
to
be
brought
i
strongly
suspected
back
here
what
i
held
out
on
were
the
details
about
a
certain
colonel
jose
alvino
ramos
my
belief
that
he
was
behind
the
crimes
and
in
league
with
alex
goddard
and
stalking
me
i
was
afraid
our
room
was
bugged
morgy
we
get
through
this
he
said
reaching
over
to
stroke
my
hair
if
somebody
brought
her
back
down
here
we
find
her
and
i
apologize
for
being
such
a
shit
on
the
phone
about
the
baby
i
just
had
a
local
lab
lose
three
rolls
of
kodachrome
and
i
was
seriously
frosted
at
the
world
we
can
keep
trying
if
you
want
to
just
hold
me
i
put
down
my
glass
and
i
reached
around
and
ran
my
finger
across
his
chest
it
was
so
lovely
to
be
this
close
to
somebody
you
wanted
so
much
i
loved
his
earnest
brown
eyes
and
his
soft
skin
i
loved
him
just
having
him
with
me
made
such
a
difference
the
unexpected
part
was
i
asked
him
to
come
and
help
me
but
now
that
he
was
here
i
was
starting
to
feel
uneasy
about
luring
him
into
my
personal
nightmare
was
that
really
fair
also
i
was
getting
hints
he
had
problems
of
his
own
the
photo
book
i
gathered
was
not
coming
together
the
way
he
hoped
he
mumbled
something
about
finding
himself
torn
between
a
heartstrings
essay
about
the
children
his
specialty
you
probably
seen
his
work
whether
you
know
it
or
not
a
devastating
portrayal
of
the
latest
crop
of
sleazy
politicos
or
a
nature
valentine
to
the
vanishing
rain
forest
but
whenever
he
agonized
about
his
work
i
knew
enough
to
keep
my
mouth
shut
and
just
listen
he
did
want
bright
ideas
he
just
wanted
me
to
clam
up
and
be
there
for
him
anyway
i
knew
he
think
his
way
through
the
problem
he
had
a
deceptive
air
of
vulnerability
that
always
disappeared
in
a
crunch
he
was
the
master
of
ad
hoc
solutions
at
that
moment
he
reached
for
his
watch
studied
it
and
abruptly
bolted
straight
up
hey
i
almost
forgot
my
surprise
i
hope
still
up
for
it
did
you
know
this
is
our
anniversary
it
was
on
this
very
day
i
first
watched
you
dive
into
that
grungy
swimming
pool
at
the
oloffson
in
my
god
you
right
i
humiliated
i
hugged
him
contritely
feeling
like
a
twit
i
guess
i
was
too
focused
on
sarah
i
screw
up
a
lot
on
birthdays
too
always
with
an
excuse
i
do
even
have
a
present
for
you
i
been
so
that
okay
he
grinned
then
stood
up
and
headed
for
the
shower
not
the
first
time
but
i
got
one
for
both
of
us
we
make
it
a
gift
to
each
other
it
help
start
you
thinking
like
a
insider
what
you
sneak
what
did
you
get
a
trip
back
into
the
void
of
prehistoric
time
he
yelled
over
his
shoulder
i
am
the
possessor
of
a
secret
about
this
town
i
called
from
belize
city
this
morning
and
made
dinner
reservations
for
us
downtown
you
see
god
i
loved
this
man
but
the
last
thing
on
my
mind
at
that
moment
was
food
honey
i
do
know
if
i
really
hey
do
wimp
out
on
me
if
we
going
to
do
this
place
at
least
we
can
do
it
in
style
besides
you
ca
live
on
smog
alone
you
got
ta
eat
he
had
a
point
starving
myself
was
going
to
help
find
sarah
any
sooner
and
there
were
details
i
wanted
to
tell
him
that
i
did
want
to
broadcast
in
the
room
what
if
colonel
ramos
had
long
ears
to
match
his
long
arm
come
on
he
pressed
just
put
on
the
slinkiest
thing
you
got
and
get
ready
to
go
native
it
help
you
put
this
part
of
the
world
into
perspective
alas
i
had
nothing
particularly
slinky
though
fortunately
packed
a
silk
blouse
i
could
loosen
and
tie
with
a
scarf
around
the
waist
do
laugh
it
worked
i
even
brushed
on
some
serious
eye
shadow
which
normally
i
do
bother
with
much
i
tried
not
to
let
him
know
how
concerned
i
was
as
we
walked
down
the
driveway
of
the
hotel
and
hailed
a
cab
while
i
furtively
searched
the
shadows
seeing
the
streets
after
dark
made
me
sad
all
over
again
for
sarah
i
still
wanted
to
see
and
feel
guatemala
the
way
she
had
but
when
i
got
close
to
the
realities
of
the
place
it
made
me
uneasy
it
turned
out
the
marvel
he
discovered
was
called
siriaco
a
wonderful
old
place
with
a
patio
and
garden
in
back
both
roofed
by
glittering
tropical
stars
which
were
down
a
stone
pathway
from
the
main
dining
room
and
bar
it
appeared
to
be
where
a
lot
of
vips
the
ruling
oligarchy
dined
it
was
romantic
and
perfect
when
we
arrived
his
special
anniversary
surprise
was
already
being
laid
out
on
a
low
stone
table
attended
by
mayan
women
all
in
traditional
dress
the
colorful
of
their
villages
red
and
blue
skirts
immense
jade
earrings
they
reconstructed
a
kingly
feast
from
old
documents
he
explained
beaming
at
my
amazement
cuisine
of
the
ancient
rain
forest
we
going
to
have
a
banquet
of
authentic
chow
from
eons
ago
and
the
meal
was
definitely
fit
for
royalty
soon
we
were
working
our
way
through
a
medley
of
piquant
flavors
that
swept
through
my
senses
as
though
i
were
in
another
world
there
was
deer
steamed
fish
baked
wild
turkey
one
calabash
bowl
set
forth
kidney
beans
another
had
half
a
dozen
varieties
of
green
legumes
all
in
a
rich
turtle
broth
a
third
offered
sweet
potatoes
others
had
various
forest
tubers
steamed
with
chiles
we
even
had
a
delicious
honey
wine
like
heavenly
nectar
served
in
red
clay
bowls
that
made
me
want
to
have
sex
right
on
the
table
there
with
steve
the
unexpected
juxtaposition
of
spices
and
flavors
made
every
bite
every
aroma
a
new
sensual
experience
let
me
say
right
here
he
a
cooking
fanatic
whereas
i
been
known
to
burn
water
i
think
it
the
new
division
of
labor
in
america
finally
the
mayan
waitresses
brought
out
cups
of
a
chocolate
dessert
drink
from
ancient
times
cocoa
beans
roasted
ground
and
boiled
with
sugarcane
the
whole
event
was
pure
heaven
except
for
the
occasional
unwanted
intrusions
various
ladino
divorcees
about
half
a
dozen
in
all
hanging
out
at
the
bar
with
heavy
perfume
and
too
much
jewelry
kept
coming
over
purportedly
to
marvel
over
our
private
feast
or
was
it
steve
big
brown
eyes
he
returned
their
attentions
with
his
polite
and
perfect
spanish
but
i
despised
them
in
any
case
they
were
shameless
not
remembering
quite
enough
espanol
however
the
best
i
could
do
was
just
to
put
my
hand
on
his
and
give
them
the
evil
eye
it
seemed
to
work
though
what
i
really
wanted
to
do
was
hold
up
a
cross
the
way
you
do
to
ward
off
vampires
hey
check
out
orion
he
said
finally
leaning
back
an
easy
delicious
finger
aimed
at
that
sprawling
constellation
i
looked
up
at
the
canopy
of
stars
and
sure
enough
the
hunter
and
his
sword
dominated
the
starry
sky
above
like
a
stalwart
centurion
guarding
us
i
always
know
i
in
the
tropics
when
it
right
overhead
honey
this
has
been
wonderful
i
declared
thank
you
so
much
i
moved
around
and
kissed
him
it
exactly
the
attitude
adjustment
i
needed
well
he
smiled
back
now
i
guess
we
got
some
organizing
to
do
so
tell
me
everything
you
left
out
back
there
at
the
hotel
i
know
you
were
holding
off
i
was
feeling
increasingly
hyper
probably
from
the
chocolate
but
i
proceeded
to
recount
all
my
findings
about
alex
goddard
and
quetzal
manor
then
i
moved
on
to
colonel
ramos
and
how
he
threatened
carly
and
me
about
my
film
finally
i
told
him
my
deep
belief
that
colonel
ramos
and
a
couple
of
his
goons
were
obviously
the
ones
who
roughed
up
lou
and
taken
sarah
bad
scene
he
said
when
i
finally
paused
for
breath
he
was
toying
with
his
cup
and
running
his
fingers
through
his
sandy
hair
in
that
deep
thought
mode
of
his
way
i
see
it
this
just
sounds
like
a
classic
case
of
selling
kids
to
me
that
right
up
there
with
murder
and
grand
larceny
well
i
also
firmly
believe
it
all
tied
in
with
alex
clinic
here
or
whatever
it
is
the
place
sarah
called
ninos
del
mundo
on
her
landing
card
i
bet
you
anything
that
where
ramos
has
taken
her
you
know
he
said
his
brow
a
perfect
furrow
eyes
narrowed
about
the
babies
you
saw
there
been
press
stories
over
the
last
few
years
about
americans
being
attacked
in
guatemala
on
suspicion
of
trying
to
kidnap
maya
children
out
in
the
villages
to
put
up
for
adoption
but
i
never
seen
any
proof
of
it
i
always
thought
it
just
might
have
been
dumb
gringos
who
do
know
the
culture
they
go
poking
around
out
in
the
countryside
and
stupidly
say
the
wrong
thing
maybe
using
schoolbook
spanish
nobody
out
there
really
understands
but
now
this
makes
me
wonder
if
love
those
babies
i
saw
up
at
quetzal
manor
are
not
kidnapped
indian
children
trust
me
they
caucasian
as
vanilla
snow
cones
try
again
i
get
your
point
he
said
quickly
but
let
me
relate
the
facts
of
life
down
here
when
you
got
some
guatemalan
colonel
behind
something
you
better
think
twice
about
how
many
rocks
you
turn
over
funny
but
that
exactly
what
some
guy
at
the
embassy
named
barry
morton
said
to
me
and
you
better
listen
this
is
the
country
that
turned
the
word
into
a
new
kind
of
verb
people
get
i
actually
knew
some
of
them
back
in
the
late
eighties
one
dark
night
an
army
truck
rolls
into
a
village
and
when
the
torture
and
other
things
are
over
with
a
few
maya
are
never
heard
from
again
he
looked
at
me
you
saw
my
pictures
of
that
village
in
the
huehuetenango
department
tzalala
where
the
army
mutilated
and
murdered
half
the
i
know
all
about
that
it
was
chilling
to
recall
his
gruesome
photos
but
i
going
to
track
down
alex
goddard
clinic
no
matter
what
that
where
they
taken
sarah
i
sure
of
it
i
just
may
need
some
help
finding
it
he
grimaced
damn
i
got
to
head
back
to
belize
by
noon
tomorrow
then
his
look
brightened
but
hey
i
finish
my
shoot
wednesday
so
i
can
drive
back
here
on
thursday
then
on
friday
maybe
we
could
come
on
love
i
ca
just
sit
around
till
the
end
of
the
week
what
am
i
going
to
do
till
then
the
very
thought
made
me
itchy
i
need
to
find
out
if
ninos
del
mundo
the
place
sarah
put
on
her
original
landing
card
is
for
real
her
card
said
it
somewhere
in
the
peten
the
rain
forest
if
i
could
find
somebody
who
okay
look
he
was
thinking
aloud
how
about
this
there
a
guy
here
in
town
who
owes
me
a
favor
a
big
one
he
screwed
me
out
of
twenty
grand
in
the
we
were
going
to
start
a
travel
magazine
i
think
i
told
you
about
that
but
then
he
took
my
money
and
split
the
country
he
ended
up
down
here
and
went
to
work
for
the
cia
till
they
sacked
him
after
that
he
leased
a
helicopter
and
started
some
kind
of
bullshit
tourist
hustle
he
sure
as
hell
knows
what
going
on
alan
dupre
the
prick
maybe
i
could
give
him
a
call
and
we
could
get
together
for
a
late
drink
he
got
an
easy
number
these
days
how
he
going
to
help
trust
me
he
our
guy
i
leaned
back
and
closed
my
eyes
my
imagination
drifting
in
that
brief
moment
my
mind
floated
back
to
yesterday
afternoon
at
loft
and
sarah
her
hallucinations
still
haunted
me
what
had
happened
to
her
in
the
rain
forest
and
why
would
she
say
she
wanted
to
go
back
then
i
snapped
back
all
right
try
and
ring
him
if
you
think
he
can
help
right
now
i
need
all
i
can
get
he
got
up
and
worked
his
way
to
the
phone
past
the
crowded
bar
while
i
tried
to
contemplate
the
night
sky
i
looked
up
again
hoping
to
see
orion
but
now
a
dark
cloud
had
moved
in
leaving
nothing
but
deepening
blackness
he
said
there
was
a
storm
brewing
part
of
an
hurricane
developing
in
the
caribbean
so
i
guessed
this
was
the
first
harbinger
tonight
out
but
tomorrow
okay
he
was
striding
back
crack
of
dawn
which
for
him
is
roughly
about
noon
we
have
a
quick
and
then
i
got
to
run
really
but
if
this
guy
know
what
going
on
down
here
nobody
does
he
probably
laid
half
those
hot
tomatillos
there
at
the
bar
the
man
has
his
sources
if
you
get
my
meaning
then
let
go
back
to
the
glorious
camino
real
i
took
his
hand
we
split
the
check
at
the
moment
even
that
seems
romantic
i
still
thinking
about
do
do
think
i
touched
his
lips
soft
and
moist
then
kissed
him
an
impulsive
but
deeply
felt
act
we
all
had
enough
thinking
for
one
day
chapter
seventeen
alan
dupre
did
ring
till
almost
the
next
morning
and
i
had
the
feeling
even
that
was
a
stretch
he
then
offered
to
meet
us
in
the
parque
concordia
right
downtown
as
i
watched
him
ambling
toward
our
bench
my
first
impression
was
why
we
bother
the
man
appeared
to
be
in
his
early
forties
and
with
discount
aviator
shades
looking
like
a
tourist
just
down
to
central
america
for
a
weekend
of
unchaperoned
bacchanals
the
flowered
sport
shirt
worn
outside
the
belt
gave
him
the
aura
of
a
tout
insufficiently
attired
without
a
can
of
coors
in
hand
how
can
this
be
progress
i
down
here
hoping
to
find
sarah
and
i
end
up
in
a
park
meeting
some
expat
operator
steve
had
explained
that
the
main
benefit
of
alan
dupre
cia
gig
was
that
he
did
learn
how
to
fly
a
helicopter
with
that
skill
he
ended
up
starting
a
tourist
agency
in
guatemala
city
using
an
old
bell
he
leased
mayan
pyramids
from
the
air
mainly
though
he
was
a
bon
vivant
who
knew
people
steve
the
brave
on
came
dupre
mirthless
smile
as
he
approached
a
jaunty
spring
entering
his
step
alan
any
friend
of
yours
has
got
to
be
brave
steve
just
stared
at
him
dupre
had
the
kind
of
empty
grin
that
looked
like
it
been
rehearsed
in
his
high
school
bathroom
mirror
it
was
thin
kind
of
forked
and
dangerous
and
this
morning
its
plaster
quality
undermined
any
attempts
at
honesty
maybe
dealing
with
complaining
tourists
every
day
of
your
life
did
that
to
you
you
called
i
came
he
was
now
shifting
from
foot
to
foot
guess
it
finally
had
to
happen
what
the
phrase
you
can
run
but
you
hide
surprise
us
both
and
pretend
you
happy
to
see
me
steve
looked
like
he
was
not
entirely
prepared
for
this
moment
he
used
the
awkward
pause
that
followed
to
introduce
me
dupre
shook
hands
like
he
was
fearful
of
germs
then
turned
back
jesus
man
i
still
working
on
the
money
honest
to
god
but
do
i
get
a
last
cigarette
before
the
firing
squad
hey
alan
ease
up
steve
was
deadpan
good
to
see
you
again
i
mean
it
love
that
waikiki
shirt
by
the
way
never
knew
you
had
such
progressive
taste
this
is
actually
my
incognito
attire
for
secret
missions
it
my
objective
today
to
look
like
some
jerk
he
glanced
around
nervously
so
how
i
doing
i
say
your
years
of
training
in
undercover
work
have
paid
off
i
listened
remembering
steve
had
explained
that
alan
dupre
career
as
a
cia
was
hampered
by
his
propensity
to
drink
too
much
tequila
and
then
brag
about
his
occupation
hoping
to
impress
whatever
woman
he
had
in
his
sights
at
the
moment
so
bring
me
up
to
date
steve
was
trying
to
hide
his
total
contempt
why
you
get
out
of
the
spook
business
langley
could
find
a
mission
for
you
after
the
evil
empire
dissolved
dupre
face
turned
pensive
man
you
do
get
it
do
you
still
got
plenty
on
its
mind
nothing
has
changed
most
people
realize
the
is
run
by
the
folks
they
vote
for
there
a
permanent
government
that
does
appear
on
larry
king
and
i
was
part
of
it
the
central
intelligence
agency
of
the
of
will
go
on
doing
exactly
what
it
always
done
guiding
events
in
third
world
toilets
like
this
through
whatever
means
are
necessary
to
protect
america
strategic
concerns
keeping
the
world
safe
for
microsoft
and
ronald
mcdonald
he
paused
and
glanced
at
me
as
though
slightly
embarrassed
then
he
continued
what
i
saying
is
all
those
beltway
turkeys
with
the
briar
pipes
and
gigabyte
computers
sitting
around
wringing
their
hands
worried
the
company
needs
a
new
mission
never
really
grasped
its
old
mission
you
right
steve
said
going
along
with
the
shtick
the
applause
lines
dupre
had
doubtless
used
in
a
thousand
bars
i
getting
slow
what
langley
needs
nowadays
is
a
new
cover
story
could
have
phrased
it
better
dupre
smiled
again
too
easily
they
actually
steve
said
cutting
him
off
impatiently
all
the
while
gazing
up
at
the
gathering
dark
clouds
as
though
they
were
a
hovering
adversary
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
we
called
you
to
discuss
a
favor
a
small
helping
hand
he
seemed
to
be
searching
for
a
sales
point
for
old
times
sake
for
old
times
sake
dupre
appeared
to
be
having
trouble
with
the
concept
yeah
all
we
want
is
to
hear
a
little
talk
of
the
town
he
gazed
out
over
the
square
police
still
strolling
by
you
know
local
information
of
the
kind
that
does
make
the
papers
right
i
said
for
starters
how
could
a
gringa
sort
of
melt
into
the
peten
rain
forest
disappear
for
months
and
months
and
then
end
up
in
a
coma
i
decided
to
feel
him
out
before
going
for
the
bigger
questions
people
disappear
down
here
all
the
time
and
nobody
in
their
right
mind
goes
around
inquiring
why
dupre
seemed
genuinely
astonished
that
anyone
would
find
such
a
thing
unusual
he
also
was
fingering
a
cigarette
pack
in
his
breast
pocket
clearly
nervous
about
the
quick
turn
our
conversation
had
taken
whatever
your
problem
in
guatemala
just
forget
about
it
drink
some
take
a
few
snapshots
of
the
picturesque
natives
and
then
move
on
to
a
civilized
place
this
is
a
land
of
mystery
lady
and
the
people
who
matter
like
it
that
way
there
are
those
here
who
take
their
privacy
very
seriously
just
like
alex
goddard
children
of
light
i
thought
or
ninos
del
mundo
or
whatever
it
called
it
was
chilling
to
hear
alan
dupre
backing
away
so
quickly
from
my
question
the
guy
seemed
truly
scared
under
all
the
bluster
i
also
observed
that
his
eyes
were
curiously
small
out
of
proportion
to
his
face
i
had
noticed
it
at
first
well
i
went
on
determined
to
push
him
an
old
landing
card
for
the
person
i
looking
for
said
her
destination
was
a
place
called
ninos
del
mundo
up
in
the
peten
i
assume
that
somewhere
in
the
northern
rain
forest
right
so
i
guess
what
i
want
to
know
is
does
that
name
stir
up
any
connections
he
looked
around
then
extracted
a
gauloise
from
a
blue
pack
and
lit
it
with
a
wooden
match
flicking
the
tip
with
his
fingernail
he
inhaled
taking
his
time
well
maybe
i
heard
a
little
something
about
a
place
some
people
call
by
that
name
he
drew
again
on
the
cigarette
and
the
story
might
include
a
female
american
or
two
about
one
a
year
actually
who
sort
of
melted
into
the
forest
never
to
be
seen
more
i
not
exactly
sure
where
it
is
though
or
even
if
what
you
hear
is
true
but
who
cares
come
on
guys
this
is
guatemala
for
chrissake
shit
happens
get
a
life
the
embassy
or
the
cia
or
anybody
ever
carry
out
an
inquiry
i
felt
my
energy
rising
a
woman
every
year
or
so
i
went
by
reforma
avenue
yesterday
and
nobody
there
seems
to
have
ever
heard
of
any
of
this
no
kidding
he
snorted
whatever
happened
that
place
our
caring
embassy
ai
gon
na
do
zip
do
faint
at
the
news
and
there
no
way
the
company
going
to
pull
their
yankee
number
roll
in
with
the
beige
sunglasses
and
yell
you
peons
we
here
to
take
names
and
kick
butt
what
happened
to
our
national
recently
acquired
a
habit
of
taking
local
situations
at
face
value
makes
for
a
lot
better
tables
at
the
tony
supper
clubs
in
town
this
guy
liked
to
talk
i
realized
but
he
had
no
interest
in
going
beyond
glib
i
glanced
at
steve
and
i
could
tell
he
was
having
the
same
thoughts
tell
you
what
steve
said
finally
how
about
this
tell
us
whatever
you
know
about
how
to
find
this
place
and
maybe
we
can
adjust
the
terms
on
the
money
you
screwed
me
out
of
i
might
settle
for
something
less
on
the
dollar
and
let
bygones
be
bygones
hey
man
you
get
your
money
i
good
for
it
dupre
sighed
and
drew
on
his
gauloise
it
just
that
things
are
a
little
tight
right
now
you
know
he
paused
matter
of
fact
i
was
hoping
you
might
be
able
to
spare
a
couple
of
bills
for
a
week
or
so
but
i
guess
his
voice
trailed
off
alan
dupre
knew
something
i
needed
to
know
or
might
know
it
steve
had
definitely
found
the
right
guy
in
that
regard
but
he
clearly
was
cautious
to
the
point
of
paralysis
as
he
kept
furtively
glancing
around
what
was
he
so
fearful
of
and
what
could
i
do
to
convince
him
to
help
me
i
stood
gazing
at
the
dark
sky
for
a
long
moment
and
then
i
had
an
idea
a
long
shot
the
take
you
go
for
when
the
sun
is
dying
and
the
unions
are
looking
at
overtime
you
do
tourist
flights
right
i
started
still
working
on
the
idea
so
how
about
pretending
i
an
eco
nut
a
lover
of
the
rain
forest
you
can
tell
whoever
you
so
afraid
of
that
you
taking
me
up
into
the
wilds
to
show
me
jaguars
or
something
a
regular
tour
just
cruising
around
taking
in
the
sights
totally
innocent
and
then
if
we
accidentally
scouted
a
little
maybe
we
could
find
the
place
jesus
you
serious
about
this
are
you
dupre
nervously
crushed
out
his
cigarette
staring
at
me
never
been
more
he
extracted
another
gauloise
okay
a
counteroffer
miss
james
morgan
james
right
miss
james
i
beginning
to
think
you
got
no
realistic
sense
of
proportion
about
this
part
of
the
world
you
fools
rush
in
right
my
point
precisely
but
if
steve
here
means
what
he
says
well
maybe
there
a
little
room
to
negotiate
maybe
i
could
take
you
on
a
quick
sightseeing
trip
and
just
for
laughs
i
could
kind
of
inadvertently
stray
over
the
area
i
think
you
might
find
productive
assuming
we
can
locate
it
but
here
my
terms
i
do
it
and
steverino
and
me
are
square
consider
it
a
cruise
fine
with
me
steve
did
even
blink
and
i
loved
him
all
over
again
right
on
the
spot
though
the
truth
was
i
knew
he
never
planned
on
seeing
a
penny
of
the
money
again
anyway
and
you
think
this
place
is
ninos
del
mundo
i
was
trying
not
to
get
my
hopes
up
too
much
but
still
dupre
lit
his
new
cigarette
you
did
hear
this
from
me
okay
you
heard
it
from
the
embassy
or
some
other
damned
place
but
that
one
name
for
it
another
is
disneyland
actually
i
think
the
local
name
is
the
old
maya
word
for
jaguar
but
everybody
acts
like
it
a
state
secret
so
all
you
get
are
rumors
well
assuming
we
find
it
then
how
could
i
get
in
i
mean
actually
in
i
was
squinting
at
him
feeling
my
body
tense
what
was
it
lou
had
said
about
a
word
he
heard
when
they
were
taking
sarah
it
sounded
like
babylon
i
also
thought
that
was
what
she
whispered
to
me
could
it
be
the
word
was
actually
baalum
the
gloomy
morning
skies
abruptly
flooded
with
the
brilliant
white
light
of
hope
i
glanced
back
at
steve
and
our
eyes
locked
for
a
long
moment
morgy
for
chrissake
what
are
you
saying
steve
took
my
hand
you
realize
this
is
guatemala
do
even
think
about
it
we
just
talking
now
okay
i
squeezed
his
hand
then
looked
back
at
dupre
i
was
just
wondering
once
we
found
it
could
i
get
a
sneak
assuming
i
wanted
to
well
i
tell
you
one
thing
miss
morgan
james
dupre
was
fingering
his
new
cigarette
oblivious
to
my
reaction
give
no
serious
thought
to
just
driving
up
the
army
be
all
over
your
butt
in
the
time
it
takes
to
cock
an
he
glanced
up
at
the
sky
again
though
now
a
dense
bank
of
dark
clouds
had
swallowed
what
remained
of
the
sun
a
gloom
was
enveloping
the
park
which
was
starting
to
empty
out
the
hawkers
and
loiterers
headed
home
to
wait
out
the
weather
but
if
we
do
find
it
then
as
long
as
we
there
i
might
be
able
to
drop
you
off
for
a
quick
glance
somehow
say
if
we
did
it
around
twilight
time
that
is
if
that
what
you
want
but
it
ten
minutes
tops
and
that
my
final
offer
frankly
i
think
you
be
in
the
extreme
to
do
it
but
in
any
case
it
got
to
be
a
enterprise
all
the
way
we
screw
this
up
and
we
could
easily
swell
the
ranks
of
the
but
you
think
you
could
actually
locate
it
what
i
hear
the
place
is
on
a
tributary
of
the
usumacinta
river
a
latrine
they
call
the
rio
tigre
way
up
in
the
northwest
army
types
you
meet
them
in
bars
from
time
to
time
like
to
bs
about
it
i
got
a
rough
idea
where
it
might
be
though
you
do
know
whether
to
believe
a
bunch
of
kid
recruits
after
beers
then
my
mind
clicked
the
rio
tigre
did
that
have
something
to
do
with
where
lou
said
sarah
was
found
that
was
definitely
where
i
wanted
to
go
morgy
have
you
lost
your
senses
steve
had
placed
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
if
the
army
involved
in
something
down
here
you
want
to
know
about
it
do
lose
sight
of
the
fact
those
goons
knocked
off
two
hundred
thousand
villagers
since
the
days
of
the
gipper
for
fear
they
might
be
commies
with
the
cia
practically
flying
in
the
ammo
this
whole
damned
country
just
one
big
mass
grave
yet
another
unclaimed
corpse
or
two
wo
make
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
difference
steve
i
bet
you
anything
that
where
she
is
saying
it
i
had
a
vision
of
all
the
things
that
had
happened
to
me
and
to
sarah
because
of
alex
goddard
i
could
wait
to
confront
the
bastard
he
brought
her
back
steve
just
glared
at
me
for
a
long
moment
despairing
christ
you
make
me
nuts
okay
look
how
about
this
at
least
let
me
come
with
you
that
way
we
face
the
unknown
together
though
i
had
a
moment
i
did
say
anything
just
stood
there
glorying
in
the
feeling
of
being
together
it
was
so
wonderful
to
have
him
with
me
and
so
difficult
to
think
about
pressing
on
without
him
there
was
a
long
awkward
pause
and
then
he
glanced
at
his
watch
blast
i
got
to
hit
the
road
if
i
going
to
get
back
in
time
to
set
up
for
tonight
shoot
i
just
pray
i
can
beat
the
rain
then
he
pulled
me
around
and
circled
me
fully
in
his
arms
please
morgy
i
really
do
like
the
sound
of
this
i
move
heaven
and
earth
to
get
back
here
by
friday
night
and
if
you
still
want
to
check
out
this
then
we
figure
out
a
way
to
do
it
together
just
you
stay
safe
i
hugged
him
back
nothing
i
do
is
going
to
mean
much
if
i
do
have
you
do
worry
i
be
okay
alan
dupre
had
abruptly
taken
an
even
deeper
interest
in
the
darkening
sky
i
got
the
feeling
he
was
uncomfortable
being
around
two
people
capable
of
caring
it
only
for
a
couple
of
days
steve
went
on
we
both
be
okay
if
we
just
stick
together
right
i
said
and
kissed
him
harder
than
i
ever
had
five
minutes
later
my
heart
and
my
head
still
at
war
with
each
other
i
was
alone
in
the
virtually
empty
park
with
my
best
friend
watching
steve
jeep
blend
into
the
smoggy
haze
of
the
avenue
made
me
feel
like
half
of
me
had
just
disappeared
into
another
dimension
so
that
that
i
declared
finally
turning
back
and
taking
a
deep
breath
i
had
to
find
sarah
before
something
else
truly
horrible
happened
to
her
and
the
one
thing
i
was
determined
to
do
was
keep
steve
as
safely
distant
from
my
search
as
i
could
even
though
it
meant
i
was
going
to
be
terribly
lonely
for
the
next
few
days
when
can
we
leave
hey
get
real
dupre
choked
whirling
around
we
ca
go
today
case
you
had
noticed
there
a
storm
coming
if
you
really
want
to
go
and
i
mean
really
want
to
then
maybe
in
a
day
or
so
preferably
when
steve
i
do
want
to
drag
him
into
this
i
said
evenly
truthfully
i
was
sounding
braver
than
i
felt
but
then
i
remembered
once
going
down
into
the
subterranean
harem
quarters
of
the
red
fort
in
agra
seemingly
miles
underground
and
pitch
black
with
nothing
but
a
flashlight
surrounded
by
screaming
bats
and
in
guano
for
no
better
reason
than
i
was
determined
to
see
how
the
women
there
once
lived
so
how
much
scarier
could
this
be
well
i
say
no
way
dupre
told
me
not
today
correction
make
that
no
fucking
way
he
had
removed
his
aviator
shades
and
was
cleaning
them
with
a
dirty
hanky
besides
i
do
think
you
have
any
business
going
up
there
in
the
first
place
if
you
not
scared
shitless
you
ought
to
be
alan
i
think
you
the
one
who
afraid
to
go
he
almost
reached
for
another
cigarette
but
then
stopped
himself
i
will
definitely
plead
guilty
to
a
disquiet
about
the
people
who
rule
this
placid
paradise
but
if
it
square
things
with
steve
then
i
take
you
up
to
have
a
quick
look
for
my
sins
but
it
got
to
be
after
the
weather
clears
i
finally
realized
he
was
already
thinking
about
his
next
loan
steve
beware
tomorrow
then
i
was
going
to
blink
because
the
peten
was
where
sarah
had
ended
up
the
first
time
and
i
was
sure
that
was
where
ramos
had
taken
her
now
dupre
stared
at
the
sky
a
moment
longer
then
caved
maybe
we
can
shoot
for
tomorrow
late
if
i
can
convince
myself
this
storm
has
done
its
worst
he
looked
back
at
me
but
i
got
ta
tell
you
one
thing
morgan
james
we
blunder
in
up
there
and
end
up
getting
ourselves
we
wo
even
get
our
pictures
in
the
papers
better
tell
your
immediate
loved
ones
where
you
going
and
it
would
be
the
worst
time
in
the
world
to
think
about
making
a
will
the
way
he
said
it
i
was
sure
for
once
he
meant
every
word
chapter
eighteen
when
i
got
back
to
the
camino
real
the
time
was
early
afternoon
and
the
bed
was
freshly
made
with
all
signs
and
scents
of
my
and
torrid
reunion
long
gone
i
tried
to
push
aside
thoughts
of
how
much
i
was
already
missing
him
and
focus
on
what
i
was
getting
myself
into
i
must
admit
i
was
having
serious
qualms
about
going
up
to
the
peten
the
part
of
guatemala
where
sarah
had
been
left
for
dead
with
my
tour
director
the
flaky
alan
dupre
i
never
been
in
a
helicopter
before
much
less
one
flying
over
a
stormy
rain
forest
on
the
other
hand
if
that
was
where
they
taken
sarah
the
sooner
i
got
there
the
better
sitting
there
in
the
room
i
found
myself
feeling
right
at
home
everything
about
it
was
so
familiar
to
an
expert
on
budget
travel
like
me
carpet
the
color
of
decaying
vegetation
the
usual
two
double
beds
one
totally
unused
except
as
a
suitcase
shelf
the
tv
suspended
over
the
dresser
and
bolted
to
the
wall
funny
but
it
was
the
first
time
i
noticed
half
the
things
in
the
room
okay
i
told
myself
the
thing
to
do
first
is
call
vincent
and
check
on
lou
also
i
wanted
to
tell
him
what
was
happening
i
just
hoped
he
would
launch
into
a
lecture
about
the
recklessness
of
what
i
was
planning
i
needed
support
not
male
advice
i
got
the
desk
to
give
me
the
local
at
t
contact
number
then
rang
right
through
to
vincent
the
next
thing
i
knew
they
were
calling
his
room
hi
how
the
patient
morgan
what
the
hell
are
you
up
to
i
been
trying
to
reach
you
i
finally
called
david
and
he
said
you
left
a
message
something
about
central
america
why
the
hell
i
was
trying
to
explain
that
to
you
sunday
night
but
you
were
pretty
far
gone
well
i
ai
that
far
gone
now
so
i
telling
you
to
by
the
way
i
interrupted
hoping
to
change
the
subject
how
you
feeling
i
guess
i
live
they
let
me
get
up
and
go
to
the
bathroom
now
they
saying
i
can
probably
go
home
tomorrow
that
encouraging
thank
god
he
was
going
to
be
okay
i
also
had
a
talk
with
gerry
downtown
he
believes
sarah
was
kidnapped
even
if
new
york
finest
do
so
that
means
the
fbi
has
jurisdiction
we
gon
na
get
some
action
they
trying
to
get
a
photo
of
that
colonel
so
maybe
i
can
id
the
bastard
but
the
consulate
giving
us
a
lot
of
shit
about
it
well
i
tracking
something
down
here
between
the
two
of
us
i
think
we
find
her
so
what
the
hell
are
you
doing
i
told
him
about
finding
the
name
of
a
destination
on
sarah
old
landing
card
and
about
meeting
a
guy
who
was
going
to
take
me
there
as
soon
as
the
weather
cleared
and
you
think
she
could
be
there
now
he
did
sound
hopeful
there
reasons
to
check
it
out
i
did
want
to
elaborate
maybe
we
get
lucky
i
was
attempting
to
say
as
little
as
possible
fearing
the
phone
was
tapped
in
that
spirit
i
decided
to
get
off
the
line
as
quickly
as
possible
lou
you
get
lots
of
rest
and
i
try
and
call
you
tomorrow
with
a
final
warning
to
watch
out
for
myself
he
took
down
my
hotel
number
and
hung
up
truthfully
he
was
sounding
pretty
tired
and
weak
not
nearly
his
old
self
well
he
had
a
right
to
be
but
at
least
there
were
no
complications
my
next
call
was
going
to
be
to
david
roth
to
check
in
on
things
at
applecore
but
first
i
wanted
to
order
up
huevos
get
some
breakfast
protein
i
was
becoming
energized
by
the
prospect
of
progress
and
being
that
way
always
makes
me
ravenous
it
probably
a
primal
female
response
that
has
a
latin
name
i
checked
out
the
number
for
room
service
and
was
literally
reaching
for
the
black
phone
when
it
rang
of
its
own
accord
startled
i
picked
up
the
receiver
wondering
who
had
my
number
hello
it
was
a
man
voice
that
sounded
vaguely
familiar
thought
i
check
in
and
see
how
things
are
going
with
your
search
hi
i
answered
back
after
a
pause
trying
to
place
his
intonation
oh
sorry
barry
morton
remember
me
fortress
america
you
came
by
the
office
yesterday
how
why
was
he
calling
me
how
did
you
get
this
you
must
have
accidentally
put
the
wrong
hotel
on
your
landing
card
as
your
address
in
guatemala
city
he
hesitated
a
second
then
said
but
i
had
my
secretary
call
around
and
well
it
happens
all
the
time
i
see
it
did
have
the
ring
of
logic
and
i
had
put
down
a
different
hotel
a
safety
measure
do
you
always
take
this
much
interest
in
your
fellow
citizens
only
when
they
come
to
see
me
personally
he
chuckled
so
how
it
going
well
thanks
for
calling
i
said
everything
moving
along
good
good
there
was
another
pause
then
incidentally
you
having
any
luck
finding
that
ninos
del
mundo
place
you
were
looking
for
i
hesitated
wondering
why
he
would
ask
and
also
unsure
what
to
say
not
yet
i
volunteered
my
god
it
finally
dawned
on
me
the
guy
was
tracking
me
he
wanted
to
know
what
i
knew
you
come
up
with
anything
at
your
end
i
been
busy
a
string
of
meetings
but
i
still
think
you
might
want
to
check
out
the
phone
book
it
was
the
second
time
he
made
the
suggestion
he
was
practically
ordering
me
to
do
it
why
you
never
know
i
afraid
that
about
the
best
i
can
do
maybe
i
will
i
said
i
been
a
little
busy
too
the
phone
call
was
feeling
stranger
and
stranger
he
was
sending
me
to
see
something
probably
in
hopes
it
would
make
me
go
away
it
was
actually
more
unnerving
than
if
he
done
nothing
at
all
well
in
any
case
i
hope
you
have
a
good
visit
he
declared
diplomatically
another
pause
planning
to
be
here
long
i
not
sure
yet
why
did
he
want
to
know
that
i
see
whatever
happens
i
hope
you
find
what
you
looking
for
best
of
luck
he
hung
up
leaving
me
with
the
feeling
he
already
knew
the
answer
to
every
question
he
asked
the
guys
at
the
airport
and
now
the
embassy
i
was
the
tourist
in
the
country
okay
maybe
i
should
just
play
along
and
see
what
happens
in
any
case
i
just
lost
my
appetite
for
fried
eggs
with
hot
sauce
but
i
had
a
definite
interest
in
the
phone
book
and
there
they
were
ninos
del
mundo
complete
with
an
address
way
out
the
boulevar
aguilar
batres
well
why
not
see
where
it
leads
you
sarah
card
said
the
place
was
in
the
peten
but
who
knows
i
got
up
off
the
bed
and
went
into
the
bathroom
for
a
shampoo
and
shower
despite
the
fact
that
barry
morton
wanted
me
to
see
this
ninos
del
mundo
place
whatever
it
was
i
did
want
to
show
up
looking
and
smelling
like
some
bedraggled
tourist
i
wear
my
tailored
blue
suit
which
along
with
the
dark
blue
heels
ought
to
make
me
look
adequately
businesslike
the
shower
was
wonderful
purging
away
the
soot
of
the
park
and
i
was
wrapping
my
hair
in
a
large
beige
towel
when
the
phone
jangled
again
i
tucked
in
the
edge
to
secure
it
and
walked
over
maybe
it
was
lou
ringing
back
no
such
luck
the
caller
was
none
other
than
my
partner
alan
dupre
i
was
not
thrilled
to
hear
his
voice
was
he
about
to
get
cold
feet
and
back
out
morgan
listen
he
said
not
wasting
time
on
niceties
there
been
a
small
change
of
plans
i
alan
do
do
this
to
me
you
shit
you
agreed
no
why
i
calling
is
we
got
to
go
ahead
and
go
up
today
storm
or
no
god
help
us
you
happy
now
what
after
that
neurotic
he
just
given
me
in
the
park
i
should
have
been
overjoyed
but
something
about
the
whole
thing
immediately
felt
synthetic
i
paused
a
long
moment
trying
to
think
the
situation
through
what
was
going
on
the
answer
to
that
was
clear
as
day
i
was
being
set
up
somebody
wanted
me
out
of
town
and
they
just
found
a
way
or
was
i
being
paranoid
again
had
the
weather
cleared
i
reached
over
and
pushed
aside
a
curtain
nope
it
looked
as
threatening
as
ever
no
question
this
was
definitely
a
setup
on
the
other
hand
why
not
use
whoever
had
put
him
up
to
this
this
told
me
for
sure
i
was
on
the
trail
of
sarah
and
the
sooner
i
got
going
the
better
aside
from
calling
new
york
and
then
checking
out
the
local
ninos
del
mundo
that
barry
morton
wanted
me
to
see
so
badly
i
had
no
other
pressing
plans
alan
i
thought
you
declared
no
way
were
you
going
to
go
today
i
said
testing
him
why
the
sudden
revision
in
scheduling
yeah
well
something
heavy
come
up
for
tomorrow
i
afraid
got
ta
be
now
or
forget
it
for
at
least
a
week
unrefined
bullshit
but
somebody
knew
how
badly
i
wanted
to
go
look
there
something
i
need
to
check
out
first
i
just
learned
about
a
place
here
in
town
i
want
to
at
least
see
it
also
called
ninos
del
mundo
no
shit
he
paused
okay
we
talk
about
it
get
the
address
and
maybe
we
can
cruise
by
if
there
time
thing
is
we
do
have
all
that
much
leeway
here
one
last
question
i
thought
i
give
him
a
final
shot
at
the
truth
just
tell
me
honestly
why
it
has
to
be
today
the
real
story
like
i
said
everything
changed
he
was
budging
so
if
doing
this
i
got
to
pick
you
up
now
and
get
us
on
our
merry
way
he
was
too
cheerful
by
half
which
definitely
told
me
he
was
lying
all
right
but
i
really
need
to
make
at
least
one
phone
call
first
i
wanted
steve
to
know
where
i
was
and
if
i
walk
out
of
here
with
a
bag
i
got
to
let
the
desk
know
i
not
skipping
on
the
bill
forget
the
phone
call
no
time
do
it
after
we
get
back
just
be
out
front
in
exactly
nineteen
minutes
this
is
not
a
dry
run
the
train
is
leaving
i
outta
here
now
there
was
a
click
and
he
was
gone
i
sat
there
a
moment
staring
at
the
floor
what
was
i
getting
into
well
there
one
way
to
find
out
play
their
game
and
beat
them
there
no
better
way
to
get
inside
what
going
on
the
first
thing
i
did
was
call
steve
hotel
in
belize
city
of
course
he
was
there
but
i
left
a
long
message
to
the
effect
that
i
was
taking
a
sightseeing
trip
up
to
the
peten
with
alan
dupre
today
because
of
unforeseen
new
circumstances
the
reasons
were
complicated
but
i
watch
out
for
myself
and
therefore
he
should
worry
that
out
of
the
way
i
looked
around
the
room
it
was
a
disaster
but
i
quickly
began
cramming
things
into
the
small
folding
backpack
i
always
took
on
trips
then
i
rang
the
kitchen
and
told
them
to
make
up
a
quadruple
egg
sandwich
huevos
por
to
go
along
with
a
large
bottle
of
distilled
water
by
the
time
i
got
to
the
reception
desk
and
explained
i
was
actually
checking
out
for
good
alan
dupre
was
already
waiting
outside
in
his
battered
green
jeep
cleaning
his
scratchy
shades
and
leaning
on
the
horn
let
him
wait
i
wrote
out
a
long
note
to
steve
on
the
chance
he
might
come
looking
for
me
then
with
deliberate
slowness
i
wandered
out
to
where
alan
jeep
was
parked
and
tossed
my
backpack
behind
the
seat
first
things
first
i
climbed
in
and
handed
him
the
address
of
ninos
del
mundo
i
copied
onto
some
hotel
stationery
this
is
where
got
to
go
he
stared
at
it
a
moment
puzzling
and
then
seemed
to
figure
out
where
it
was
upscale
part
of
this
beautiful
oasis
he
shifted
into
gear
but
more
or
less
on
the
way
he
glanced
up
nervously
at
the
sky
we
just
do
have
all
day
off
we
headed
toward
the
suburbs
through
a
ganglia
of
downtown
streets
laced
with
pizza
joints
and
vendors
till
we
eventually
ended
up
on
a
avenue
that
looked
as
genteel
as
oyster
bay
when
we
got
to
the
address
i
told
him
to
park
across
the
way
and
just
sat
a
moment
staring
the
building
itself
was
a
windowless
compound
surrounded
by
trees
and
a
high
wall
of
white
stucco
with
a
guardhouse
and
wide
iron
gate
not
unusual
for
guatemala
protecting
a
long
walkway
the
whole
thing
looked
like
a
fortress
except
the
view
through
the
gate
was
a
pastoral
vista
of
neat
flower
beds
and
a
pristine
lawn
the
guardhouse
itself
had
a
dozing
teenager
undoubtedly
with
an
uzi
resting
across
his
lap
okay
alan
i
said
time
to
get
with
the
program
how
your
spanish
depends
on
who
i
trying
to
bs
he
shrugged
and
began
cleaning
his
sunglasses
again
well
why
do
you
see
if
you
can
talk
us
past
that
guard
he
stared
at
the
entrance
a
moment
be
a
waste
of
our
precious
time
tell
you
right
now
kids
like
that
only
answer
to
one
boss
the
the
big
guy
whoever
he
is
that
how
they
retain
their
employment
a
joint
locked
down
this
tight
do
give
sunday
tours
well
i
think
he
asleep
so
i
going
to
be
creative
and
see
if
there
a
back
entrance
of
some
kind
maybe
a
service
area
that
give
me
some
idea
of
what
going
on
here
do
what
you
want
but
make
it
fast
he
said
leaning
back
in
the
seat
and
try
not
to
get
shot
i
carefully
got
out
and
walked
down
the
empty
street
a
way
then
followed
the
stucco
the
building
covered
an
entire
city
block
until
i
came
across
an
alley
entrance
with
another
large
iron
gate
padlocked
shut
i
peered
up
the
driveway
shrouded
in
overhanging
trees
but
there
was
nothing
in
the
parking
lot
except
a
couple
of
army
jeeps
and
a
black
land
rover
well
barry
morton
really
wanted
me
to
see
this
but
why
is
there
a
connection
to
the
place
in
the
peten
and
what
are
the
army
vehicles
all
about
i
sighed
and
made
my
way
back
to
the
street
when
i
reached
the
jeep
alan
was
gone
but
then
i
realized
he
was
over
talking
to
the
young
guard
offering
him
a
cigarette
a
few
moments
later
he
waved
and
casually
ambled
back
okay
he
settled
in
and
hit
the
ignition
here
the
official
deal
this
place
is
some
kind
of
hospice
for
unwed
mothers
they
also
take
in
orphans
or
so
he
thinks
according
to
him
no
american
women
have
ever
had
anything
to
do
with
the
place
which
is
probably
why
i
never
heard
of
it
he
glanced
at
me
as
we
sped
off
you
happy
now
debriefing
young
army
dudes
is
a
specialty
of
mine
so
i
think
probably
the
straight
scoop
did
you
ask
if
it
connected
with
something
in
the
peten
i
was
still
hoping
in
any
case
whatever
it
was
i
was
collecting
more
pieces
of
the
puzzle
hey
give
me
a
break
he
shifted
up
gaining
speed
i
know
when
to
push
and
this
was
the
precise
moment
the
kid
was
itchy
enough
as
it
was
like
who
the
fuck
are
you
gringo
and
what
are
you
doing
here
i
got
all
i
could
get
without
a
cold
he
glanced
over
you
ask
me
a
little
gratitude
would
be
entirely
out
of
place
okay
gracias
happy
now
ecstatic
the
jeep
was
open
and
i
checked
out
the
sky
which
was
growing
darker
and
more
threatening
by
the
minute
the
promised
foul
weather
still
seemed
to
be
just
that
promised
but
it
was
definitely
on
the
way
alan
dupre
must
really
be
scared
finally
i
leaned
back
in
the
torn
plastic
seat
and
closed
my
eyes
was
this
ninos
del
mundo
the
latin
branch
of
children
of
light
the
place
where
alex
goddard
babies
came
from
considering
the
interest
colonel
ramos
had
in
my
movie
the
army
jeeps
could
be
a
also
there
seemed
to
be
an
even
chance
that
barry
morton
was
involved
somehow
but
it
was
all
still
guesswork
and
anyway
this
was
the
place
sarah
had
put
on
her
landing
card
del
mundo
was
somewhere
up
north
hidden
in
the
rain
forest
ready
or
not
sar
hang
on
chapter
nineteen
what
did
he
say
i
asked
not
quite
catching
the
burst
of
spanish
from
the
cockpit
the
explosion
of
expletives
had
included
the
word
something
about
malfunction
god
help
us
alan
dupre
helicopter
reminded
me
of
the
disintegrating
taxis
on
guatemala
city
potholed
streets
the
vibration
in
the
passenger
compartment
was
so
violent
it
made
my
teeth
chatter
my
stomach
felt
like
it
was
in
a
cocktail
shaker
and
the
deafening
roar
could
have
been
the
voice
of
hell
i
was
staring
out
the
smudgy
plastic
window
where
less
than
three
hundred
meters
below
i
could
just
make
out
the
top
of
the
peten
rain
forest
of
northwest
guatemala
sweeping
by
beneath
us
so
this
was
what
it
looked
like
dense
and
impenetrable
it
was
a
yawning
deciduous
carpet
enveloping
the
earth
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
if
something
ten
stories
high
could
be
called
carpet
i
been
in
the
forests
of
india
kerala
and
seen
some
of
the
denser
growth
in
southern
mexico
but
this
was
like
another
planet
the
main
problem
was
a
violent
downpour
the
leading
edge
of
the
hurricane
was
now
sweeping
across
the
yucatan
stirring
up
the
treetops
of
the
jungles
below
the
rain
which
had
begun
in
earnest
about
ten
minutes
after
we
got
airborne
had
been
steadily
increasing
to
the
point
it
was
now
almost
blinding
this
was
the
risk
i
chosen
to
take
but
let
me
admit
right
here
the
weather
had
me
seriously
scared
my
fingernails
digging
into
the
armrests
and
my
pulse
erratic
and
now
was
there
something
else
only
been
in
the
air
for
minutes
and
already
we
had
some
kind
of
mechanical
issue
looming
what
was
left
to
go
wrong
some
of
the
lights
went
out
or
something
dupre
tried
a
shrug
not
sure
no
big
deal
though
this
old
bird
always
gets
the
job
done
his
pilot
lieutenant
villatoro
formerly
of
the
guatemalan
army
had
just
shouted
the
new
development
back
to
the
cabin
probably
nothing
do
worry
about
it
do
worry
about
it
his
tourist
helicopter
was
a
guatemalan
candidate
for
the
air
space
museum
an
old
bell
patched
together
with
chicle
and
corn
masa
surely
the
storm
was
pushing
it
far
beyond
its
stress
limits
right
but
what
exactly
sounds
like
the
nav
station
he
clicked
open
his
seat
belt
something
who
knows
if
you
be
happier
i
go
up
and
look
i
felt
my
palms
go
cold
does
seem
too
much
to
ask
considering
the
world
down
below
us
was
a
hostile
mélange
of
towering
trees
all
straining
for
the
sky
while
the
ground
itself
was
a
dark
tangle
of
ferns
lianas
strangler
vines
creepers
among
which
lurked
olympic
scorpions
and
some
of
the
earth
most
poisonous
snakes
if
we
had
to
set
down
here
i
did
even
want
to
think
about
it
to
lower
a
helicopter
into
the
waves
of
flickering
green
below
us
would
be
to
confront
the
hereafter
it
just
the
lights
like
he
said
dupre
yelled
back
from
the
cockpit
door
letting
a
tone
of
i
told
you
to
chill
out
seep
through
he
was
peering
past
the
opening
at
the
long
line
of
instruments
he
followed
his
announcement
with
a
sigh
as
he
moved
back
into
the
main
cabin
relax
i
was
relaxed
and
from
the
way
his
eyes
were
shifting
and
his
gauloise
cigarettes
were
being
he
was
on
the
verge
of
a
nervous
breakdown
in
his
case
it
was
just
the
weather
he
was
fidgeting
like
a
trapped
animal
giving
me
the
distinct
sense
he
was
doing
someone
invisible
bidding
and
was
terrified
he
might
fail
well
why
do
you
try
and
fix
it
was
he
trying
to
act
calm
just
to
impress
me
ca
you
bang
on
the
panel
or
something
okay
okay
let
me
see
what
i
can
do
jesus
he
edged
back
into
the
cockpit
next
to
villatoro
the
wind
was
shaking
us
so
badly
that
even
bent
over
he
was
having
trouble
keeping
his
balance
then
he
halfheartedly
slammed
the
dark
instrument
readouts
with
the
heel
of
his
open
hand
when
the
effort
produced
no
immediate
electronic
miracle
he
settled
into
the
copilot
seat
he
yelled
at
villatoro
his
voice
barely
audible
over
the
roar
of
the
engine
and
the
plastering
of
rain
on
the
fuselage
then
he
looked
out
the
windscreen
at
the
torrent
slamming
against
it
and
rubbed
at
his
chin
se
mi
the
guatemalan
shouted
back
i
sensed
he
was
hoping
to
sound
efficient
and
unperturbed
dupre
claimed
his
pilot
had
personally
checked
out
the
bell
and
prepped
it
now
though
like
i
said
the
lights
on
the
nav
station
maybe
the
electrical
how
about
the
backup
battery
dupre
was
just
barely
keeping
his
cool
villatoro
scratched
his
chin
i
tell
you
the
truth
the
backup
is
i
tested
it
before
we
left
but
i
could
find
any
replacements
in
provisiones
i
figure
no
problem
but
now
amigo
i
felt
another
wave
of
dismay
right
into
my
churning
stomach
well
keep
your
heading
north
dupre
voice
was
coming
from
a
place
of
extreme
pain
and
if
you
sight
the
rio
tigre
then
or
whatever
should
be
more
or
less
due
west
according
to
what
assuming
just
keep
your
eyes
open
he
paused
problem
is
with
all
this
rain
the
river
going
to
be
tough
to
make
out
i
redoubled
my
efforts
to
peer
out
the
window
searching
my
breath
coming
in
bursts
still
nothing
dear
god
what
now
finally
dupre
headed
back
bracing
himself
against
the
firewall
as
he
crouched
and
passed
through
the
door
into
the
main
cabin
when
he
settled
into
the
seat
across
from
me
he
was
glaring
at
me
as
though
everything
was
my
fault
you
know
he
was
yelling
again
beginning
to
think
maybe
we
ought
to
try
to
find
a
clearing
and
just
sit
out
this
crap
till
morning
he
leaned
over
and
peered
down
through
the
bell
spattered
side
windows
at
the
dense
tangle
of
growth
below
after
a
moment
he
got
up
and
once
more
moved
the
toward
the
cockpit
still
with
the
same
troubled
look
this
time
however
he
was
beaming
as
he
shouted
back
there
may
be
a
god
after
all
i
think
we
just
intersected
the
rio
tigre
we
can
bear
due
west
now
along
the
river
we
could
be
getting
close
if
it
where
i
think
it
is
i
turned
and
stared
down
again
barely
making
out
the
thread
of
the
stream
through
the
rain
yes
maybe
there
hope
still
below
us
the
windblown
treetops
were
a
solid
mass
of
pastel
sparkles
a
dancing
sea
of
hungry
green
but
then
i
thought
i
saw
something
hey
it
might
even
be
a
clearing
i
quickly
unbuckled
and
made
my
way
up
to
the
cockpit
hanging
on
to
anything
i
could
grasp
alan
look
i
yelled
and
pointed
off
to
the
side
out
through
the
windscreen
i
think
we
just
passed
over
something
back
there
see
where
he
squinted
you
can
still
just
make
it
out
i
twisted
and
kept
pointing
i
was
biting
my
lip
trying
to
hold
together
there
it
looks
like
some
kind
of
clearing
maybe
i
do
know
but
what
if
we
just
set
down
there
and
let
this
storm
blow
over
he
ordered
villatoro
to
bank
and
go
back
for
a
look
a
few
moments
later
it
was
obvious
there
was
an
opening
in
the
trees
yeah
let
check
it
out
he
then
said
something
to
villatoro
and
we
started
easing
toward
it
definitely
a
wide
opening
the
billowing
ocean
of
trees
below
us
seemed
to
be
parting
like
the
red
sea
as
we
settled
in
there
had
to
be
solid
ground
down
there
somewhere
had
to
be
what
i
was
pointing
there
over
to
the
side
it
a
kind
of
hill
or
something
it
where
dupre
squinted
again
his
voice
starting
to
crack
then
he
focused
in
yeah
maybe
there
something
there
hard
to
tell
what
it
is
though
but
i
guess
we
about
to
find
out
he
gestured
to
the
lieutenant
barking
an
order
in
quick
spanish
while
the
bell
kept
moving
lower
through
the
opening
dupre
flicked
on
the
landing
lights
and
appeared
to
be
muttering
a
prayer
of
thanks
i
was
staring
out
growing
ever
more
puzzled
a
hill
was
there
all
right
the
problem
was
it
was
definitely
topped
by
a
stone
building
i
could
just
make
it
out
in
the
glare
of
the
lights
what
do
you
think
that
is
what
do
i
think
dupre
studied
the
scene
for
a
moment
longer
and
then
his
face
melted
into
the
first
smile
i
seen
since
we
left
i
think
we
are
lucky
beyond
belief
god
help
us
we
may
have
found
it
that
could
be
the
damned
pyramid
or
whatever
supposed
to
be
up
here
he
leaned
back
yeah
congratulations
look
at
that
damned
thing
either
this
is
the
place
or
we
about
to
become
the
archaeologists
of
the
year
cover
of
the
nobel
frigging
prize
at
that
moment
i
almost
wanted
to
hug
alan
dupre
but
not
quite
instead
i
moved
farther
into
the
cockpit
trying
to
get
a
look
out
the
windscreen
by
then
we
had
lowered
well
through
the
opening
in
the
trees
the
helicopter
controls
fighting
against
the
blowing
rain
and
it
felt
as
though
we
begun
descending
into
the
ocean
depths
in
a
diving
bell
surrounded
by
thrashing
branches
now
though
i
was
staring
at
the
ghostly
rise
of
the
pyramid
emerging
out
of
the
rain
it
looks
brand
new
yeah
the
whole
place
is
disneyland
remember
except
this
deal
ai
about
mickey
mouse
believe
me
there
plenty
of
army
hanging
out
around
here
lieutenant
villatoro
took
us
ever
lower
gently
guiding
the
descent
and
now
we
were
only
a
few
feet
above
the
ground
there
certainly
was
no
mistaking
what
was
around
us
even
with
the
blowing
rain
the
pyramid
loomed
over
one
side
of
a
large
plaza
a
big
paved
area
that
was
mostly
obscured
from
the
skies
since
the
swaying
trees
arched
over
and
covered
it
from
aerial
view
okay
we
about
to
touch
down
dupre
was
clawing
at
his
pocket
yearning
for
a
cigarette
so
if
you
still
want
to
get
out
move
over
by
the
door
i
disengage
the
main
rotor
once
we
on
the
ground
as
we
settled
in
the
rotor
began
to
cause
surface
effect
throwing
a
spray
off
the
paving
stones
which
now
glistened
under
the
cold
beam
of
the
landing
lights
and
looming
above
us
off
to
the
right
was
a
stepped
pyramid
in
the
classic
mayan
style
we
all
lapsed
into
silence
as
the
bell
skids
thumped
onto
the
stones
the
pilot
villatoro
kept
glancing
over
at
the
pyramid
as
though
he
did
want
to
admit
even
seeing
it
did
he
know
something
alan
and
i
did
this
was
the
moment
i
been
bracing
for
i
was
increasingly
convinced
somebody
wanted
me
to
see
this
place
whatever
it
was
but
now
what
should
i
do
well
the
first
thing
was
to
dip
my
toe
in
the
water
do
a
quick
reconnoiter
on
the
ground
if
this
really
was
dupre
maya
disneyland
could
it
also
be
part
of
alex
goddard
clinic
of
miracles
the
location
sarah
called
ninos
del
mundo
if
i
knew
that
for
sure
then
i
could
start
figuring
how
to
find
out
if
she
was
here
as
i
suspected
and
get
her
out
of
his
clutches
maybe
the
embassy
might
even
be
prodded
into
helping
an
american
citizen
for
a
change
i
getting
out
to
look
around
a
little
but
not
till
you
turn
off
the
engine
i
want
to
be
able
to
use
my
ears
all
right
but
do
take
all
day
this
kind
of
weather
i
want
to
keep
it
warm
he
turned
to
villatoro
and
shouted
the
order
in
the
sheets
of
pounding
rain
i
figured
that
no
one
could
have
heard
us
come
in
that
at
least
was
positive
when
the
rpm
of
the
engine
had
died
away
i
clicked
open
the
wide
door
slid
it
back
and
looked
around
in
the
glare
of
the
landing
lights
i
realized
at
once
that
the
stones
were
old
weathered
and
worn
but
the
grout
that
sealed
them
was
white
and
brand
new
the
plaza
was
free
of
moss
clean
as
the
day
it
was
done
which
did
not
appear
to
be
all
that
long
ago
above
me
the
pyramid
continuous
recessed
tiers
of
glistening
stones
towered
into
the
dim
skyline
of
trees
i
stepped
out
onto
the
pavement
holding
my
breath
the
plaza
was
almost
in
size
reminding
me
of
an
italian
piazza
around
me
the
rain
was
lessening
slightly
and
as
my
eyes
adjusted
my
god
there
was
just
a
pyramid
here
through
the
sparkle
of
raindrops
at
the
edge
of
the
helicopter
lights
i
could
see
what
looked
like
a
wide
cobblestone
walkway
leading
into
the
dense
growth
just
off
the
edge
of
the
square
probably
toward
the
south
away
from
the
river
connecting
the
plaza
with
distant
groups
of
small
houses
set
in
clusters
could
alex
goddard
miracle
clinic
be
in
some
collection
of
primitive
huts
it
made
no
sense
but
i
decided
to
try
to
get
a
closer
look
i
walked
about
thirty
feet
away
from
the
helicopter
across
the
slippery
paving
when
i
saw
a
flash
of
lightning
in
the
southeast
followed
by
a
boom
of
thunder
that
echoed
over
the
square
at
least
i
thought
it
was
thunder
or
maybe
the
army
was
holding
heavy
artillery
practice
somewhere
nearby
abruptly
the
rain
turned
into
a
renewed
torrent
and
the
next
thing
i
heard
was
the
helicopter
engine
start
up
again
then
i
sensed
the
main
rotor
engage
a
sudden
whoom
whoom
whoom
quickly
spiraling
upward
in
frequency
hey
i
told
him
not
to
when
i
looked
back
at
the
bell
open
door
dupre
was
standing
there
frantically
searching
the
dark
as
he
heaved
out
my
tan
backback
and
what
looked
like
a
sleeping
bag
both
splashing
down
onto
the
paving
what
for
a
moment
i
thought
the
thunder
or
whatever
it
was
must
have
completely
freaked
him
then
what
was
actually
happening
hit
me
with
a
horrifying
impact
alan
wait
i
started
dashing
back
but
now
the
main
rotor
was
creating
a
powerful
downdraft
throwing
the
rain
into
me
like
a
monsoon
by
the
time
i
managed
to
fight
my
way
through
the
spray
the
rotor
was
on
full
power
and
alan
dupre
and
his
bell
were
already
lifting
off
i
reached
up
and
just
managed
to
brush
one
greasy
skid
as
he
churned
away
straight
upward
into
the
rainy
night
you
shit
i
yelled
up
but
my
final
farewell
was
lost
in
the
whine
of
the
engine
my
god
i
thought
watching
him
disappear
i
just
been
abandoned
hundreds
of
miles
deep
in
a
central
american
rain
forest
then
it
all
sank
in
whoever
had
gotten
to
him
was
playing
a
rough
game
they
did
want
me
just
to
see
they
wanted
me
delivered
here
probably
to
secure
me
in
the
same
place
sarah
was
colonel
ramos
or
whoever
had
frightened
dupre
into
bringing
me
had
wanted
us
both
so
what
now
were
we
both
going
to
be
disappeared
staring
around
at
the
pyramid
and
the
empty
square
i
could
feel
my
heart
pounding
then
i
tripped
over
the
rolled
sleeping
bag
and
sank
to
my
knees
there
in
the
middle
of
the
plaza
soaked
to
the
skin
and
so
angry
i
was
actually
trembling
up
above
me
alan
dupre
king
of
had
switched
off
his
landing
lights
and
a
few
moments
later
the
hum
of
the
bell
was
swallowed
by
the
night
sounds
of
the
forest
the
din
of
crickets
the
piercing
call
of
night
birds
the
basso
groan
of
frogs
celebrating
the
storm
and
something
else
an
eerie
sense
of
the
unnatural
i
ca
explain
it
even
the
night
songs
of
the
birds
felt
ominous
the
primeval
forest
reasserting
its
will
it
was
haunting
like
nature
mockery
of
my
desolation
i
pounded
the
sleeping
bag
and
felt
shit
how
did
i
let
this
happen
get
a
grip
i
finally
stood
up
and
looked
around
maybe
when
god
wants
to
do
you
up
right
she
gives
you
what
you
want
you
used
alan
dupre
just
like
you
intended
he
got
you
here
but
there
more
to
the
plan
of
whoever
holding
his
puppet
strings
so
the
thing
now
is
do
let
yourself
be
manipulated
any
more
get
off
your
soggy
butt
and
start
taking
control
of
the
situation
that
was
when
i
sighted
a
white
form
at
the
south
forested
edge
of
the
plaza
what
i
ducked
down
sure
it
was
somebody
lurking
there
waiting
to
try
to
beat
me
to
death
as
they
had
sarah
did
ramos
intend
to
just
murder
me
immediately
but
there
was
no
getting
away
if
i
could
see
them
they
surely
could
see
me
and
where
would
i
escape
to
anyway
i
dug
my
yellow
plastic
flashlight
out
of
my
backpack
and
my
hand
shaking
flicked
it
on
the
beam
however
was
just
swallowed
up
in
the
rain
all
right
i
strapped
on
the
pack
and
taking
a
deep
breath
threw
the
rolled
sleeping
bag
over
my
shoulder
and
headed
across
the
slippery
paving
toward
the
white
which
now
glistened
in
the
periodic
sheets
of
distant
lightning
meet
them
straight
on
try
and
bluff
when
i
got
closer
though
i
realized
what
i
was
seeing
was
actually
just
the
skin
of
a
jaguar
bleached
white
the
head
still
on
fearsome
teeth
bared
which
had
been
hung
beside
the
paved
pathway
thank
god
but
then
playing
my
light
over
it
i
thought
bad
sign
my
first
encounter
at
is
with
a
spooky
dead
cat
it
felt
like
a
chilling
omen
of
i
was
sure
what
i
studied
it
a
moment
longer
with
my
flashlight
shivering
then
turned
and
headed
quickly
across
the
plaza
toward
the
pyramid
now
barely
visible
in
the
rain
if
there
were
jaguars
or
god
knows
what
else
around
i
figured
i
be
safer
up
at
the
top
when
i
reached
the
base
and
shined
my
light
up
the
steps
i
saw
they
were
steeper
than
i
thought
but
they
also
looked
to
be
part
of
some
meticulous
restoration
and
probably
safe
to
climb
and
there
at
the
top
was
a
stone
hut
complete
with
what
appeared
to
be
a
roof
good
if
there
had
been
anything
taller
than
it
around
i
think
i
might
have
just
climbed
a
tree
on
the
way
up
i
began
trying
to
digest
what
the
place
really
was
the
pyramid
was
fake
or
was
it
a
hundred
years
ago
the
eccentric
brit
archaeologist
sir
arthur
evans
whimsically
reconstructed
the
palace
of
minos
on
crete
with
his
own
money
and
it
still
a
tourist
highlight
so
why
could
somebody
do
the
same
with
a
reclaimed
mayan
pyramid
in
central
america
still
this
was
different
had
the
feel
of
being
somebody
crazed
obsession
as
i
topped
the
steps
i
realized
the
building
that
crowned
the
pyramid
was
also
a
restoration
like
everything
else
including
a
decorated
wooden
lintel
above
the
door
that
looked
to
be
newly
lacquered
bizarre
i
moved
through
the
door
and
unloaded
my
gear
then
extracted
my
water
bottle
now
for
a
pull
finally
i
unrolled
alan
sleeping
bag
on
the
dry
stone
floor
removed
and
spread
out
my
wet
clothes
peed
off
the
edge
then
took
a
new
pair
of
underpants
jeans
and
shirt
out
of
my
backpack
donned
them
and
uneasily
crawled
in
i
was
shivering
whether
from
the
soaking
rain
or
from
fright
i
know
and
my
teeth
were
trying
to
chatter
was
i
hidden
away
enough
to
be
safe
i
did
know
all
i
did
know
was
i
was
in
something
deeper
than
i
ever
been
in
my
life
and
i
had
no
idea
how
i
was
going
to
get
out
and
i
was
both
scared
to
death
and
angry
as
hell
sarah
was
here
though
i
was
certain
like
a
sixth
sense
i
could
feel
her
presence
out
there
somewhere
in
the
rain
for
a
moment
i
was
tempted
to
just
plunge
into
the
storm
looking
for
her
but
a
split
second
reflection
told
me
that
was
the
stupidest
thing
i
could
do
instead
i
should
try
and
get
some
rest
till
the
storm
cleared
and
keep
periodic
watch
on
the
plaza
in
case
somebody
showed
up
then
the
minute
there
was
light
i
hit
the
ground
and
go
find
her
i
suppose
nothing
ever
happens
the
way
you
plan
my
mind
was
racing
and
my
nerves
were
in
the
red
but
i
was
so
exhausted
from
the
trip
in
the
bell
i
could
really
stay
alert
very
long
in
spite
of
myself
i
eventually
drifted
off
into
a
dreamless
doze
a
victim
of
the
narcotic
song
of
wind
in
the
giant
cebia
trees
and
the
insistent
drumming
of
forest
rain
on
the
roof
chapter
twenty
i
awoke
as
a
sliver
of
sun
flashed
through
the
stone
doorway
of
the
room
and
forest
birds
erupted
around
me
in
celebration
as
i
pulled
myself
up
and
moved
over
to
the
opening
a
quick
tropical
glare
burned
into
my
face
my
god
the
dawn
was
electric
it
was
the
purest
blue
ever
seen
a
swath
of
artist
cobalt
an
azure
radiance
from
the
sky
glistened
off
the
rain
forest
leaves
around
me
had
i
dreamed
the
stormy
haunted
world
of
the
night
before
when
i
looked
down
everywhere
below
me
was
a
bank
of
dense
pastel
mist
was
the
plaza
really
there
or
had
i
imagined
it
i
felt
like
the
top
of
the
pyramid
was
floating
on
a
cloud
babylon
that
was
what
sarah
had
called
this
place
ancient
and
mysterious
i
took
a
breath
of
the
morning
air
and
wondered
what
would
draw
her
back
here
was
ultimate
escape
from
her
other
life
even
so
why
would
she
want
to
return
after
somebody
had
tried
to
murder
her
what
was
waiting
down
there
in
the
fog
turning
back
i
noticed
that
the
room
inside
walls
were
embossed
with
rows
and
rows
of
classic
mayan
glyphs
like
little
cartoon
faces
all
molded
in
newly
set
plaster
to
my
groggy
sight
they
seemed
playful
harmless
little
caricatures
though
next
to
them
were
raised
of
warriors
in
battle
dress
it
was
both
sublimely
austere
and
eerie
even
creepy
i
knelt
down
and
rolled
my
sleeping
bag
trying
to
clear
my
head
then
i
stuffed
my
clothes
into
my
backpack
and
thought
about
the
river
the
rio
tigre
down
somewhere
at
the
back
of
the
pyramid
and
i
felt
my
pulse
rate
edging
up
the
first
thing
i
wanted
to
do
was
see
it
in
the
light
of
day
it
had
been
sarah
way
out
the
only
thing
i
knew
for
sure
she
touched
get
going
and
do
it
i
headed
through
the
rear
door
and
down
the
back
steps
when
i
reached
the
ground
the
dense
forest
closed
in
around
me
but
i
was
certain
the
river
lay
dead
ahead
through
the
tangle
of
trees
as
i
moved
down
a
path
that
grew
ever
steeper
the
canopy
up
above
thickened
arching
over
me
till
it
blotted
out
the
pure
blue
of
the
sky
and
the
air
was
filled
with
nature
sounds
birdcalls
trills
songs
and
clacks
all
mingled
with
the
hum
and
buzz
of
insects
then
suddenly
from
somewhere
up
in
the
canopy
a
pack
of
screeching
spider
monkeys
began
flinging
rotten
mangos
down
in
my
direction
i
also
thought
i
heard
the
asthmatic
territorial
roar
of
a
giant
howler
monkey
the
lord
of
the
upper
jungle
and
what
about
snakes
i
kept
an
eye
on
the
vines
and
tendrils
alongside
the
path
expecting
any
moment
to
stumble
across
a
deadly
a
little
operator
whose
poison
heads
straight
for
your
nervous
system
on
the
other
hand
the
birds
the
forest
birds
were
everywhere
scarlet
macaws
and
toucans
and
darting
flocks
of
amazon
parrots
brilliant
and
iridescent
their
sweeping
tails
a
psychedelic
rainbow
of
green
yellow
red
then
the
next
thing
i
knew
the
path
i
was
on
abruptly
opened
onto
a
mossy
expanse
of
green
surely
the
rio
tigre
and
my
god
those
bumps
scattered
everywhere
they
the
eyes
and
snouts
of
yes
crocodiles
lurking
there
in
wait
hoping
i
dumb
enough
to
wade
in
forget
what
alan
dupre
said
this
is
definitely
not
disneyland
then
i
glanced
upstream
and
caught
sight
of
a
string
of
mahogany
dugout
canoes
tied
along
the
shore
they
were
huge
about
fifteen
feet
long
and
three
feet
wide
and
clearly
designed
to
be
they
wait
a
minute
lou
said
sarah
was
found
in
a
dugout
canoe
that
had
drifted
all
the
way
down
the
rio
tigre
to
where
it
joins
the
usumacinta
one
more
clue
she
might
have
been
here
maybe
i
was
closing
in
i
glared
back
at
the
crocodiles
unblinking
reptile
eyes
and
tried
to
get
my
mind
around
the
fact
sarah
could
have
stood
right
where
i
was
standing
or
been
set
adrift
from
here
in
a
coma
to
float
downstream
seeing
that
vision
i
felt
unbidden
tears
trailing
down
my
cheeks
and
the
questions
i
had
kept
piling
up
was
this
the
location
of
alex
goddard
miracle
clinic
why
was
a
secret
what
was
the
connection
between
this
place
and
sarah
ravaged
mind
and
body
i
wanted
to
know
all
of
it
and
by
god
i
would
this
was
the
farthest
i
ever
been
from
civilization
though
i
was
trying
not
to
let
that
fact
sink
in
too
deeply
the
water
was
green
and
full
of
small
aquatic
creations
but
i
managed
to
find
a
reasonably
unmossy
spot
and
still
keeping
an
eye
on
the
leering
crocodiles
splashed
my
face
it
felt
good
even
if
it
was
filthy
okay
i
seen
enough
of
the
river
i
raised
up
and
stretched
time
to
go
my
hopes
at
war
with
my
nerves
i
turned
my
back
on
the
scummy
fetid
rio
tigre
and
headed
back
up
the
jungle
trail
toward
the
plaza
when
i
got
there
i
was
struck
all
over
again
by
the
vision
of
the
pyramid
something
like
it
might
have
been
here
originally
but
in
any
case
it
had
been
completely
redone
with
newly
cut
yellowish
stones
and
white
lime
plaster
an
exotic
castle
nestled
in
the
green
lap
of
the
rain
forest
rising
above
the
square
like
a
haunting
presence
it
must
have
been
well
over
a
hundred
feet
high
a
stone
wedding
cake
with
a
dozen
steep
tiers
between
the
ground
and
the
platform
at
the
top
which
also
was
square
and
roughly
fifteen
feet
on
the
side
standing
there
gazing
at
it
i
think
i
never
felt
more
disoriented
sarah
sarah
how
could
we
both
end
up
here
at
the
last
outpost
of
the
known
world
but
seeing
is
believing
i
took
a
deep
breath
then
turned
down
the
pathway
toward
the
huts
through
the
mist
it
was
gradually
becoming
clear
that
actually
was
a
village
and
a
sizable
one
the
walkway
led
past
a
string
of
clearings
each
with
clusters
of
huts
built
in
the
ancient
classical
style
with
walls
of
mud
over
rows
of
vertical
saplings
their
roofs
and
porches
peaked
with
thatch
weathering
to
browns
and
grays
the
structures
outlined
starkly
against
the
towering
green
arbor
of
the
forest
above
were
grouped
around
paved
patios
it
all
was
neat
and
meticulous
like
a
jungle
brigadoon
although
the
effects
of
the
storm
were
everywhere
blown
thatch
and
bamboo
i
still
felt
as
if
i
fallen
into
a
time
warp
where
clocks
had
gone
backward
what
then
i
began
to
catch
the
outlines
of
people
as
though
they
had
materialized
out
of
the
pale
fog
all
pure
maya
short
and
brown
shiny
black
hair
they
appeared
to
be
just
going
about
their
daily
lives
i
was
approaching
a
workshop
area
where
under
a
wide
thatch
shade
men
with
adzes
were
carving
bowls
plows
various
implements
from
mahogany
and
other
rain
forest
woods
next
to
them
potters
were
fashioning
brown
clay
jugs
they
all
were
wearing
white
loincloths
and
a
large
square
cotton
cloth
knotted
around
their
shoulders
their
hair
tied
back
in
dense
ponytails
it
must
have
been
how
the
maya
looked
a
thousand
years
ago
their
earnestness
reminded
me
of
the
villagers
i
once
filmed
in
the
yucatan
for
the
discovery
channel
with
one
big
difference
there
i
was
the
gringo
here
i
felt
like
a
powerless
time
traveler
the
sense
of
being
lost
in
another
age
was
as
compelling
as
the
colonial
at
williamsburg
but
this
was
real
and
it
was
decidedly
spooky
finally
one
of
the
men
looked
up
and
noticed
me
our
eyes
locked
for
an
instant
it
seemed
like
forever
and
then
he
reached
over
and
in
a
way
that
seemed
breathless
shook
the
man
next
to
him
gesturing
toward
me
together
they
gazed
back
as
though
viewing
a
phantom
their
brown
faces
intent
and
then
they
turned
and
called
out
to
the
others
alerting
them
what
are
they
going
to
do
with
me
i
wondered
with
a
sudden
chill
a
stranger
here
in
their
hideaway
midst
would
they
just
turn
on
me
find
some
women
get
off
the
street
i
turned
and
headed
as
fast
as
i
could
down
the
cobblestone
central
path
till
i
saw
a
cluster
of
females
on
a
whitewashed
stone
porch
long
hair
falling
over
their
shoulders
as
they
bent
to
their
tasks
beneath
the
thatch
overhangs
some
were
stirring
rugged
clay
pots
of
corn
soaking
in
lime
others
were
grinding
the
softened
maize
to
tortilla
thinness
on
wide
granite
platters
behind
them
was
another
group
that
appeared
to
be
part
of
a
sewing
commune
young
wives
busy
at
their
looms
layering
thread
after
thread
of
dyed
cotton
none
of
them
was
wearing
a
the
traditional
multicolored
blouse
i
remembered
from
the
waitresses
in
the
restaurant
instead
they
all
had
on
a
kind
of
white
shift
i
never
seen
before
talk
to
them
let
them
know
you
no
threat
to
anybody
as
i
moved
down
the
hard
clay
pathway
toward
them
two
looked
up
and
took
notice
their
first
reaction
seemed
to
be
alarm
as
they
tensed
and
stared
but
then
i
tried
a
smile
and
it
seemed
to
work
their
looks
turned
to
puzzlement
then
embarrassed
grins
as
though
they
wanted
to
be
friendly
but
were
sure
how
to
acknowledge
my
presence
when
i
reached
the
porch
several
reached
out
to
touch
me
one
older
woman
short
and
wizened
and
extremely
brown
even
tried
to
stroke
my
hair
what
was
going
on
i
was
taken
aback
but
i
also
was
determined
to
get
through
to
them
why
not
just
ask
them
if
sarah
here
is
there
any
chance
they
understand
spanish
i
smiled
and
nodded
quiero
descubrir
esta
una
gringa
de
los
estados
unidos
aqui
they
all
returned
uncomprehending
looks
then
glanced
quickly
at
each
other
in
confusion
or
at
least
that
was
how
i
read
their
faces
sarah
i
said
pronouncing
the
name
slowly
sarah
crenshaw
sara
one
voiced
then
others
they
backed
away
and
immediately
began
a
heated
dispute
which
eventually
involved
all
the
women
well
one
thing
was
for
sure
they
damned
well
knew
who
i
was
asking
about
but
why
were
they
so
upset
next
several
of
them
grew
testy
pointing
at
me
as
they
continued
to
argue
finally
the
two
i
first
approached
turned
and
began
urging
me
to
leave
gesturing
at
me
with
their
hands
as
though
sweeping
me
out
of
the
compound
yes
there
was
no
mistaking
i
was
being
dismissed
and
i
detected
an
odd
nervousness
as
they
glanced
around
seemingly
worried
somebody
might
catch
me
there
with
them
i
got
the
feeling
finally
decided
they
did
want
me
anywhere
near
them
since
they
kept
pointing
down
the
thoroughfare
in
the
direction
of
the
pyramid
i
blown
it
i
thought
they
must
have
figured
out
i
here
to
get
her
and
decided
they
no
longer
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
me
what
did
that
mean
and
now
what
do
i
do
as
i
retreated
back
out
to
the
main
walkway
i
felt
a
growing
sense
of
defeat
then
looking
down
it
i
realized
literally
been
going
in
a
circle
it
was
actually
a
large
oval
that
curved
back
to
the
main
square
and
the
pyramid
where
i
started
from
god
what
a
nightmare
i
obviously
had
to
rethink
my
game
plan
find
a
way
to
communicate
and
on
top
of
that
i
was
dying
of
thirst
i
fished
out
the
plastic
container
from
my
backpack
then
walked
across
the
square
and
settled
myself
on
the
first
step
leading
up
the
steep
front
as
i
drew
on
the
bottle
my
mind
still
swirling
i
happened
to
notice
an
upright
stone
slab
off
to
the
side
like
a
tall
thin
tombstone
with
a
of
a
maya
warrior
on
it
next
to
some
kind
of
serpent
god
probably
kukulkan
one
of
the
few
maya
deities
i
knew
and
then
down
the
side
were
rows
of
lines
and
dots
i
studied
them
a
minute
before
realizing
it
was
the
classical
mayan
number
system
telling
precisely
when
things
happened
to
the
ruler
shown
there
born
on
such
and
such
a
date
assumed
the
kingship
won
great
battles
all
carefully
dated
as
career
i
knew
that
dots
represented
single
years
horizontal
lines
the
number
five
the
maya
loved
numbers
and
numerology
so
that
was
when
i
glanced
up
to
see
a
group
of
women
approaching
slowly
across
the
square
with
a
bunch
of
the
men
watching
from
the
forest
arbors
beyond
and
they
were
huddled
around
something
they
were
carrying
whatever
it
was
they
seemed
to
be
delivering
it
to
me
then
i
realized
they
were
the
same
ones
who
just
kicked
me
out
of
their
compound
what
next
are
they
coming
to
drive
me
from
the
plaza
too
should
i
try
and
forcibly
search
all
the
huts
but
then
they
set
down
their
load
it
turned
out
to
be
a
crude
palanquin
and
stepped
aside
as
they
beckoned
me
forward
for
a
moment
i
just
stared
disbelieving
i
felt
like
i
was
seeing
someone
i
did
want
to
recognize
perhaps
because
that
someone
looked
so
much
like
me
morgy
they
told
me
a
new
one
was
here
and
i
hoped
it
was
you
sarah
was
swinging
her
skinny
legs
off
the
side
her
voice
bright
her
face
was
drawn
but
her
hair
was
neat
and
her
eyes
were
radiant
the
most
wonderful
place
you
ever
seen
she
was
wearing
a
white
shift
that
reminded
me
of
the
blue
hospital
smock
she
had
on
the
last
time
i
saw
her
except
here
it
seemed
more
like
something
that
had
a
special
significance
like
the
robes
of
an
acolyte
her
shoes
were
soft
brown
slippers
that
looked
and
around
her
waist
was
a
braided
leather
band
as
i
stared
at
her
i
wondered
if
she
was
really
as
transformed
as
she
looked
she
was
undeniably
stronger
than
two
days
ago
in
spite
of
what
that
bastard
alex
goddard
and
his
guatemalan
army
cronies
had
done
to
her
to
get
her
here
but
still
she
had
to
be
half
dead
thank
god
lou
could
see
her
now
sar
oh
sar
i
rushed
over
and
threw
my
arms
around
her
she
been
freshly
bathed
and
perfumed
a
fragrance
like
chocolate
but
she
felt
like
a
bag
of
bones
are
you
okay
i
was
afraid
was
all
just
a
dream
she
hugged
me
back
then
started
rising
to
her
feet
god
could
she
walk
but
now
i
remember
everything
sar
i
come
to
take
you
home
i
grasped
her
hand
warm
and
soft
to
help
her
stand
though
it
was
necessary
you
not
safe
no
it
wonderful
now
then
she
turned
and
said
something
to
one
of
the
women
it
took
me
a
moment
to
realize
she
was
speaking
their
language
i
guessed
it
was
kekchi
maya
i
was
stunned
how
did
she
learn
it
finally
she
looked
back
at
me
and
switched
to
english
again
i
did
understand
before
i
was
sick
so
much
sar
come
on
i
slipped
my
arm
around
her
we
going
to
get
you
out
of
here
i
never
felt
so
helpless
alan
dupre
had
said
there
was
a
road
but
it
was
controlled
by
the
army
right
now
i
did
even
know
where
it
was
maybe
i
could
find
a
phone
or
radio
call
the
embassy
there
must
be
something
alex
goddard
has
to
be
here
somewhere
but
he
not
going
to
stop
me
i
strangle
him
if
he
tries
i
hugged
her
again
the
feel
of
her
frame
making
my
soul
ache
but
most
hurtful
of
all
i
was
sure
she
would
want
to
leave
sar
can
you
understand
me
i
tried
to
catch
her
deep
blue
eyes
taking
you
home
your
father
very
worried
about
you
mention
of
lou
seemed
to
finally
get
through
to
her
she
turned
and
examined
me
with
a
quizzical
look
and
then
her
eyes
hardened
morgy
he
was
never
there
for
me
her
voice
was
filled
with
certainty
and
pain
but
when
i
went
to
see
goddard
he
let
me
come
here
for
the
ceremony
it
so
spiritual
after
sar
come
on
what
did
she
mean
by
ceremony
whatever
it
was
i
had
to
get
her
out
of
this
place
immediately
we
are
you
here
for
the
ceremony
her
face
flooded
with
renewed
joy
it
two
days
from
now
maybe
he
let
you
she
should
be
resting
it
was
a
harsh
voice
directly
behind
us
i
recoiled
then
whirled
around
three
men
were
standing
there
two
of
them
young
privates
in
uniforms
of
the
guatemalan
army
and
carrying
assault
rifles
the
ones
with
the
long
ominous
curved
clip
steve
called
de
the
horn
of
the
goat
the
third
was
in
a
black
sweatshirt
and
black
jeans
his
long
hair
tied
back
in
a
ponytail
they
should
have
known
better
than
to
bring
her
out
here
alex
goddard
said
not
in
her
condition
the
bastard
it
was
all
coming
together
in
my
mind
he
tried
to
kill
her
once
before
and
now
he
was
going
to
finish
the
job
but
he
have
to
kill
me
first
i
here
to
take
her
home
i
marched
up
to
him
you
not
about
to
get
away
with
kidnapping
i
going
to
get
the
embassy
to
she
here
for
important
medical
reasons
he
met
my
eyes
i
hope
you
allow
me
the
opportunity
to
help
her
what
do
you
mean
i
explain
if
you
give
me
a
chance
he
revolved
and
delivered
some
brusque
orders
in
kekchi
maya
to
the
women
who
nodded
apologetically
and
began
helping
sarah
back
onto
the
palanquin
after
he
admonished
her
in
the
same
language
he
then
said
something
in
quick
spanish
to
the
two
young
army
privates
who
gave
him
a
firm
salute
turned
and
walked
over
to
pick
the
palanquin
up
to
carry
it
for
the
women
the
sense
of
authority
he
exuded
reminded
me
of
that
first
morning
we
met
at
quetzal
manor
his
eyes
flashed
from
benign
to
demanding
to
benign
in
an
instant
no
damn
it
i
strode
over
shoved
the
soldiers
aside
and
took
her
hand
sar
honey
do
you
understand
what
going
on
something
terrible
happened
to
you
when
you
were
here
before
i
so
worried
but
he
says
i
need
to
stay
morgy
she
drew
back
it
best
helping
me
as
i
watched
the
two
privates
carry
her
away
down
the
cobblestone
pathway
swung
over
their
shoulders
i
felt
my
helplessness
become
complete
the
army
here
was
under
his
control
just
like
everything
else
how
was
i
going
to
tell
lou
about
this
that
sarah
had
been
brainwashed
whatever
alex
goddard
had
done
to
her
had
turned
her
into
some
kind
of
moonie
ready
to
denounce
her
own
father
so
now
did
i
have
two
battles
to
wage
one
with
alex
goddard
and
one
with
her
then
he
walked
over
to
me
i
not
going
to
ask
how
you
got
here
though
i
assume
it
easy
he
smiled
like
a
kindly
priest
and
put
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
but
however
you
did
it
i
glad
you
decided
to
come
important
for
you
to
be
here
she
needs
you
now
chapter
cut
the
crap
i
pulled
away
still
in
shock
from
seeing
sarah
so
addled
i
wanted
more
than
anything
else
in
the
world
just
to
slug
him
why
did
you
bring
her
here
think
about
your
answer
kidnapping
is
a
serious
crime
in
the
states
i
been
very
concerned
about
her
he
looked
up
at
the
groves
of
cebia
trees
around
the
square
a
quiet
glance
as
though
to
inhale
the
misty
morning
air
my
legal
threat
had
gone
right
past
him
probably
because
here
he
was
the
only
law
but
now
she
receiving
the
treatment
she
needs
i
expect
she
be
fine
before
long
treatment
i
was
caught
off
guard
okay
let
start
getting
things
straight
when
she
was
here
before
somebody
tried
to
beat
her
to
death
how
what
happened
then
was
beyond
my
control
he
motioned
me
to
join
him
as
he
settled
onto
the
first
step
of
the
pyramid
sadness
in
his
eyes
we
were
alone
in
the
square
now
and
i
felt
like
i
become
his
personal
prisoner
trapped
sarah
was
is
very
dear
to
me
i
care
for
her
deeply
you
cared
so
much
for
her
she
ended
up
in
a
coma
over
on
the
mexican
border
i
did
sit
instead
i
just
bored
in
hoping
to
stare
him
down
but
his
eyes
had
grown
distant
that
little
trick
he
had
of
alternating
between
intimacy
and
remoteness
again
it
reminded
me
of
that
first
morning
we
met
looking
out
over
the
bluffs
of
the
hudson
if
you
let
me
i
like
to
try
and
tell
you
something
of
the
circumstances
surrounding
that
tragedy
he
was
gazing
off
in
the
direction
the
women
had
gone
you
see
when
sarah
first
appeared
at
quetzal
manor
in
new
york
she
was
a
very
troubled
young
woman
she
declared
she
was
a
person
of
pure
spirit
and
she
wanted
to
have
a
baby
without
so
much
as
touching
a
man
some
procedure
that
would
produce
a
divine
child
created
of
cosmic
energy
cosmic
energy
i
had
a
flashback
hearing
the
words
to
the
time
when
she
just
turned
six
and
we
been
sent
by
my
mother
to
the
hayloft
to
track
down
nests
secreted
there
by
rogue
chicken
hens
when
we
came
across
a
cache
of
eggs
she
asked
if
baby
chicks
came
out
of
them
i
assured
her
they
did
and
then
she
asked
if
human
babies
came
from
eggs
too
my
biology
was
pretty
thin
but
i
told
her
i
supposed
they
did
sort
of
but
then
the
eggs
were
probably
hatched
or
something
before
babies
were
born
she
thought
about
that
a
moment
scrunching
up
her
face
then
declared
no
and
bitterly
began
smashing
the
eggs
babies
and
all
living
things
came
from
another
world
she
declared
a
special
place
we
could
not
see
they
came
directly
from
god
that
was
why
she
would
seek
out
someone
like
alex
goddard
for
her
he
must
have
seemed
a
messenger
of
the
unseen
who
better
to
create
a
child
for
her
the
ironic
part
was
i
found
him
for
almost
the
same
reason
seeking
a
miracle
when
all
else
had
failed
were
sarah
and
i
even
more
alike
than
i
realized
so
i
began
trying
to
work
with
her
he
was
turning
back
to
me
but
then
i
discovered
she
been
born
with
an
abnormality
of
the
uterus
it
has
a
medical
name
but
suffice
to
say
it
very
rare
and
afflicts
only
about
one
woman
in
twenty
thousand
even
after
my
diagnosis
though
she
refused
to
give
up
she
was
a
person
of
enormous
tenacity
god
i
thought
why
did
she
come
home
to
us
to
lou
and
me
we
loved
her
i
felt
my
guilt
go
out
to
her
all
over
again
she
next
declared
she
wanted
to
come
here
to
to
the
place
of
miracles
i
told
her
that
yes
miracles
can
sometimes
transpire
here
but
only
at
a
great
price
we
would
need
to
have
an
agreement
and
she
would
have
to
keep
it
no
matter
what
what
do
you
mean
an
agree
truthfully
though
he
went
on
ignoring
me
i
immediately
regretted
the
offer
since
i
realized
she
was
far
too
unstable
for
this
environment
finally
i
forbade
her
to
come
but
just
before
my
next
scheduled
trip
she
found
out
and
booked
herself
on
the
same
flight
there
was
literally
nothing
i
could
do
to
stop
her
she
put
ninos
del
mundo
on
her
landing
card
i
was
growing
sick
to
my
stomach
at
the
rehearsed
way
he
was
recounting
her
story
that
this
place
right
my
clinic
here
is
known
by
that
name
the
village
itself
is
called
baalum
he
was
easily
meeting
my
eye
holding
his
own
in
our
battle
of
wills
sarah
was
i
have
to
say
a
very
impressionable
young
person
once
here
she
forgot
all
about
her
purpose
for
coming
she
should
have
stayed
up
the
hill
there
he
was
pointing
off
to
the
south
where
i
could
care
for
her
but
instead
she
moved
down
here
into
the
compounds
then
she
discovered
a
hallucinogenic
substance
they
have
here
began
using
it
heavily
and
i
think
it
tipped
her
into
a
form
of
dementia
so
she
was
doing
drugs
something
i
always
secretly
feared
well
maybe
she
was
still
having
flashbacks
of
some
kind
maybe
that
explained
why
she
was
off
in
another
world
when
she
came
out
of
her
coma
what
kind
of
substance
he
sighed
then
shrugged
and
answered
here
in
the
rain
forest
an
ugly
toad
the
you
see
them
around
near
sunset
that
has
glands
down
its
back
that
excrete
a
milky
white
poison
i
knew
about
them
they
were
migrating
north
now
even
into
florida
they
were
huge
and
looked
like
jabba
the
hutt
in
star
wars
i
hate
toads
of
all
varieties
but
the
thought
of
those
monsters
made
me
shudder
my
god
is
their
toxin
lethal
was
sarah
trying
to
destroy
herself
was
that
why
her
mind
was
so
blitzed
i
heard
yes
it
can
kill
you
but
it
can
also
if
processed
correctly
with
fermented
honey
give
you
truly
supernatural
visions
the
classical
maya
used
it
for
ceremonial
purposes
i
managed
to
reconstruct
how
they
prepared
it
and
something
i
now
deeply
regret
i
showed
the
shamans
here
how
to
replicate
the
procedure
at
the
time
it
was
just
a
minor
part
of
my
research
into
traditional
pharmacology
but
she
heard
about
it
and
persuaded
them
to
give
her
a
vial
then
more
and
more
that
did
sound
like
sarah
always
out
on
the
edge
testing
new
realities
but
then
i
thought
a
moment
about
what
he
actually
said
some
of
the
people
here
in
his
place
of
miracles
were
doing
heavy
drugs
and
she
got
caught
up
in
it
but
why
did
you
stop
her
you
unfeeling
bastard
i
tried
believe
me
but
i
afraid
she
was
far
past
listening
to
me
by
then
she
was
learning
the
kekchi
maya
dialect
becoming
totally
immersed
in
their
world
she
began
having
episodes
of
complete
and
then
one
day
she
told
the
women
in
her
compound
she
was
going
over
to
palenque
the
maya
ruins
in
mexico
it
where
the
classical
maya
held
their
last
kingship
ceremony
before
anyone
realized
she
was
serious
she
stole
one
of
their
their
mahogany
dugout
canoes
and
headed
down
the
rio
tigre
his
eyes
had
turned
completely
dark
the
way
he
used
to
blank
them
out
she
just
went
missing
everyone
here
was
devastated
we
all
loved
her
i
stood
there
weighing
his
story
it
did
ring
true
i
supposed
she
was
capable
of
something
that
crazy
but
would
she
have
actually
done
it
i
did
think
so
then
i
remembered
something
else
he
said
you
said
you
proposed
an
what
was
that
about
he
stared
at
me
it
nothing
that
need
concern
us
suffice
to
say
i
kept
my
part
anyway
it
over
and
past
now
why
would
he
tell
me
did
she
make
some
bargain
with
the
devil
but
regarding
sarah
he
went
on
i
only
just
learned
she
been
found
and
brought
to
new
york
in
a
coma
wanting
to
do
what
i
could
i
immediately
called
the
hospital
and
out
of
professional
courtesy
they
told
me
she
shown
early
stages
of
coming
out
of
it
but
she
appeared
to
be
hallucinating
it
was
exactly
what
i
feared
his
voice
trailed
off
i
hope
i
did
the
right
thing
but
when
i
learned
been
released
i
arranged
for
her
to
be
brought
back
here
where
perhaps
i
can
do
something
for
her
what
in
rare
cases
the
hallucinogen
she
took
permanently
alters
critical
synapses
in
the
brain
i
fearful
she
may
have
abused
it
to
the
extent
something
like
that
could
have
occurred
no
one
in
the
would
have
the
slightest
idea
what
to
do
but
i
think
i
may
know
of
an
herbal
antidote
they
turned
to
in
ancient
times
that
can
repair
at
least
part
of
the
damage
i
also
knew
that
getting
her
back
here
through
normal
channels
would
be
impossible
so
you
had
colonel
ramos
and
a
bunch
of
his
guatemalan
thugs
just
break
in
and
take
her
i
did
know
which
part
of
the
story
horrified
and
angered
me
the
most
i
have
the
misfortune
to
know
him
reasonably
well
and
i
explained
it
was
very
important
to
me
and
he
agreed
to
assist
i
honestly
did
know
where
else
to
turn
i
understand
there
may
have
been
some
violence
for
which
i
apologize
but
these
people
have
their
own
way
of
doing
things
he
rose
and
came
over
and
put
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
i
hope
you
understand
the
son
of
a
bitch
was
coming
on
oily
and
contrite
when
he
just
subcontracted
an
outright
kidnapping
i
wanted
to
kill
him
finally
i
walked
away
trying
to
get
a
grip
on
my
anger
you
know
that
bastard
also
broke
into
my
apartment
and
stole
a
reel
of
a
picture
i
shooting
i
turned
back
i
also
got
a
strong
feeling
he
the
one
who
just
threatened
one
of
the
women
i
filmed
well
if
that
happened
then
let
me
say
welcome
to
the
paranoid
harassment
of
the
guatemalan
high
command
he
sighed
against
the
morning
sound
of
birds
chirping
all
around
us
unfortunately
i
gather
they
assumed
you
documenting
the
operations
of
children
of
light
in
some
way
doing
a
movie
his
eyes
drifted
off
into
space
as
though
seeking
a
refuge
you
see
my
project
up
here
in
the
peten
is
to
carry
out
pharmaceutical
research
with
as
few
distractions
as
possible
but
in
guatemala
city
i
have
what
is
in
effect
a
hospice
for
girls
in
trouble
which
is
also
called
niiios
del
mundo
by
the
way
connected
with
my
adoption
service
children
of
light
however
any
time
niiios
del
mundo
takes
in
an
orphaned
or
abandoned
infant
and
tries
to
provide
it
with
a
loving
home
through
adoption
in
the
states
the
government
here
always
threatens
to
hold
up
the
paperwork
if
i
do
give
a
bribe
what
they
call
an
fee
so
if
you
were
to
probe
too
deeply
let
me
just
say
it
not
something
care
to
see
lead
off
minutes
it
sounded
like
more
bs
but
i
could
prove
that
yet
well
why
do
you
just
clear
that
up
and
then
i
take
sarah
and
but
i
only
now
initiated
her
treatment
surely
you
want
to
give
it
a
chance
i
looked
out
at
the
rain
forest
this
was
the
place
she
come
to
once
and
though
i
never
admit
it
to
alex
goddard
it
was
the
place
announced
she
wanted
to
return
to
but
something
devastating
had
happened
to
her
mind
here
what
should
i
do
the
fact
was
i
did
trust
alex
goddard
any
farther
than
i
could
throw
him
i
had
to
get
sarah
and
get
us
both
out
of
here
as
soon
as
possible
though
that
meant
i
have
to
neutralize
him
and
the
army
and
then
use
my
limited
american
dollars
to
try
to
buy
our
way
back
to
guatemala
city
but
come
he
turned
his
gaze
toward
the
south
let
me
show
you
the
thing
i
proudest
of
here
it
just
up
there
he
was
pointing
toward
a
dense
section
of
the
rain
forest
in
the
opposite
direction
from
the
river
and
up
a
steep
incline
i
could
see
anything
but
trees
but
then
i
still
had
the
feeling
stepped
through
the
looking
glass
and
found
sarah
trapped
there
the
next
thing
i
knew
we
were
on
an
uphill
forest
trail
headed
due
south
i
think
it
time
you
told
me
what
going
on
back
there
in
the
village
i
said
what
was
it
about
this
place
that
had
seized
such
a
claim
on
sarah
mind
is
difficult
to
explain
to
someone
encountering
it
for
the
first
time
he
paused
much
of
it
is
so
i
think
i
can
handle
it
you
have
every
right
to
know
but
i
do
really
know
where
to
start
how
about
the
beginning
why
was
he
being
so
ambiguous
very
well
he
was
taking
out
a
pair
of
gray
sunglasses
as
though
to
gain
time
it
actually
goes
back
about
ten
years
ago
when
i
was
prospecting
for
rainforest
plants
up
here
in
the
peten
and
accidentally
stumbled
across
this
isolated
village
which
clearly
had
been
here
since
classical
times
i
immediately
noticed
a
huge
mound
of
dirt
everybody
said
was
haunted
by
old
ones
and
i
knew
right
away
it
had
to
be
a
buried
pyramid
they
more
common
down
here
than
you
think
so
i
struck
a
bargain
with
the
village
elders
and
acquired
the
site
but
after
i
unearthed
it
and
began
the
restoration
i
became
inspired
with
a
vision
one
day
i
found
myself
offering
to
restore
anything
else
they
could
find
which
eventually
included
by
the
way
a
magnificent
old
steam
bath
in
exchange
for
which
they
would
help
me
by
undertaking
a
grand
experiment
a
return
to
their
traditional
way
of
life
so
you
deliberately
closed
them
off
to
the
modern
world
it
told
me
alex
goddard
could
control
a
mayan
village
just
as
he
controlled
everything
else
he
touched
it
also
confirmed
he
had
a
weakness
for
the
grandiose
gesture
would
a
time
come
when
i
could
exploit
that
i
told
them
that
together
we
would
try
to
recreate
the
time
of
their
glory
and
perhaps
in
so
doing
we
could
also
rediscover
its
spirit
and
wisdom
on
the
practical
side
they
would
help
me
by
bringing
me
the
rare
plants
i
needed
to
try
and
rediscover
the
lost
native
american
pharmacologies
and
in
return
i
would
build
them
a
clinic
where
families
can
come
for
modern
pediatric
and
services
so
a
project
we
share
together
i
call
it
a
miracle
that
still
did
begin
to
explain
why
it
felt
so
eerie
something
else
was
going
on
just
under
the
surface
what
was
he
really
doing
here
then
the
path
uphill
abruptly
opened
onto
a
clearing
in
which
sat
a
large
building
its
color
a
dazzling
white
most
likely
plaster
over
cinder
block
with
a
thatch
roof
and
a
wide
ornate
mahogany
door
at
the
front
the
building
was
nestled
in
a
grove
of
trees
whose
vines
and
tendrils
had
embraced
it
so
thoroughly
there
was
no
telling
how
far
it
extended
back
into
the
forest
there
also
was
a
parking
lot
paved
and
fed
by
a
gravel
road
leading
south
seeing
it
i
felt
an
immediate
wave
of
relief
even
better
the
lot
itself
contained
pickup
trucks
while
sunburned
maya
men
were
lounging
in
the
shade
of
a
nearby
tree
and
smoking
cigarettes
they
were
not
from
baalum
they
wore
clothes
and
they
were
speaking
spanish
unlike
the
men
in
loincloths
down
in
the
village
yes
that
how
i
can
get
us
out
of
here
a
few
dollars
parked
there
also
was
a
tan
humvee
the
ultimate
vehicle
which
i
assumed
belonged
to
alex
goddard
maybe
i
should
just
try
to
steal
it
as
we
passed
through
the
door
and
into
the
vestibule
of
the
building
i
glimpsed
a
cluster
of
maya
women
and
children
crowded
into
a
brilliantly
lit
reception
area
goddard
smiled
and
waved
at
them
and
several
nodded
back
timorously
and
with
enormous
reverence
they
were
being
attended
by
a
attractive
maya
woman
in
a
blue
uniform
the
name
lettered
on
her
blouse
was
marcelina
who
was
holding
a
tray
of
vials
and
hypodermic
needles
she
was
pure
all
of
five
feet
tall
with
broad
cheekbones
and
penetrating
eyes
unlike
the
other
women
in
the
room
however
there
was
no
air
of
resignation
about
her
she
was
full
of
authority
a
palpable
inner
fire
one
of
my
most
successful
programs
here
he
nodded
a
greeting
to
her
is
to
provide
free
vaccinations
and
general
health
resources
for
the
villages
in
this
part
of
the
peten
department
i
thought
usaid
already
had
projects
in
guatemala
the
sight
deeply
depressed
me
they
all
looked
so
poignant
the
women
with
their
shabby
and
lined
faces
the
children
even
more
disheartening
sad
waifs
with
runny
noses
and
watery
eyes
which
confirmed
again
that
they
come
in
the
pickups
parked
outside
driven
here
by
the
men
i
had
six
hundred
cash
in
dollars
i
could
just
buy
one
of
those
junkers
for
that
alex
goddard
glanced
around
as
though
reluctant
to
respond
in
the
presence
of
all
the
maya
you
saw
those
guards
down
there
just
now
they
nothing
but
boys
with
guns
kidnapped
by
the
government
on
market
day
and
pressed
into
the
army
they
all
around
here
the
powers
that
be
in
guatemala
city
are
very
threatened
by
what
i
achieving
so
they
got
these
army
kids
hanging
around
keeping
an
eye
on
me
they
also
hate
the
fact
i
can
provide
health
services
better
than
they
can
but
to
answer
your
question
most
of
the
aid
money
gets
soaked
up
by
the
bureaucracy
in
guatemala
city
so
the
people
up
here
have
learned
to
rely
on
me
the
army
however
despises
me
and
everything
i
doing
what
a
load
of
bs
you
just
admitted
you
had
an
inside
track
with
colonel
alvino
ramos
anybody
can
see
children
of
light
or
ninos
del
mundo
or
whatever
the
hell
other
aliases
you
use
is
thick
as
thieves
with
the
guatemalan
armed
forces
do
insult
my
intelligence
it
just
makes
me
furious
i
turned
to
marcelina
she
begun
passing
out
candies
to
the
mesmerized
children
showing
them
how
to
remove
the
cellophane
before
putting
them
into
their
mouths
though
she
was
pure
maya
she
looked
educated
i
instinctively
liked
her
maybe
she
could
tell
me
what
was
really
going
on
here
do
you
speak
english
yes
she
was
gazing
at
me
with
a
blend
of
curiosity
and
concern
if
i
got
a
procedure
scheduled
shortly
goddard
interjected
urging
me
on
down
the
tiled
hallway
but
i
need
to
take
a
moment
and
recharge
come
with
me
and
we
can
talk
some
more
near
the
end
of
the
hall
we
entered
a
spacious
kitchen
he
walked
over
and
opened
the
refrigerator
care
for
a
little
something
to
eat
he
looked
back
speckled
white
hair
swinging
across
his
shoulders
as
his
ponytail
came
loose
i
had
marcelina
whip
up
some
gazpacho
last
night
and
i
see
there
some
left
it
my
own
secret
recipe
special
herbs
from
around
here
it
good
and
good
for
you
i
not
hungry
it
was
true
i
was
growing
ravenous
but
i
was
repressing
the
feeling
because
of
everything
else
that
was
going
on
his
village
was
holding
back
its
secrets
and
now
his
clinic
of
miracles
also
felt
suspiciously
wrong
i
seen
plenty
of
rural
operations
in
developing
countries
and
this
setup
was
far
too
big
and
fancy
the
whole
thing
did
begin
to
compute
as
you
like
he
gave
an
absent
shrug
i
looked
around
and
noticed
that
just
off
the
kitchen
was
another
space
which
was
i
realized
his
private
dining
room
there
was
a
rustic
table
in
the
center
that
looked
like
it
had
been
carved
from
the
trunk
of
a
large
cebia
tree
i
walked
in
and
moments
later
he
followed
carrying
a
tray
with
two
calabash
bowls
of
gazpacho
and
some
crusty
bread
in
case
you
change
your
mind
and
decide
to
join
me
he
placed
a
bowl
opposite
where
he
was
planning
to
sit
like
i
said
there
unusual
herbs
around
here
with
flavors
you
never
dreamed
of
he
began
eating
while
behind
him
i
glimpsed
marcelina
moving
down
the
hall
carrying
more
trays
of
vaccine
and
headed
out
toward
the
vestibule
again
i
had
to
find
a
way
to
talk
to
her
as
i
settled
into
the
rickety
chair
that
faced
my
plate
i
glanced
down
and
saw
a
red
lumpy
mixture
with
a
spray
of
indefinable
green
specks
across
the
top
like
a
scattering
of
jungle
stars
no
way
when
i
looked
up
again
he
was
swabbing
his
lips
with
a
white
napkin
his
penetrating
eyes
boring
in
now
he
said
it
time
we
started
concentrating
on
you
got
you
going
with
your
program
chapter
my
program
i
stared
back
at
him
feeling
a
jolt
with
my
thoughts
completely
focused
on
sarah
the
last
thing
on
my
mind
was
my
own
baby
now
that
you
here
he
smiled
there
no
reason
we
proceed
this
is
after
all
a
place
of
miracles
right
you
let
sarah
destroy
her
mind
and
now
you
want
me
to
do
even
think
about
it
i
have
to
tell
you
i
not
overly
impressed
thus
far
with
your
i
said
first
i
passed
out
in
your
clinic
and
then
my
doctor
in
new
york
told
me
those
drugs
ramala
gave
me
are
highly
illegal
and
for
good
reason
what
is
is
more
often
than
not
the
judgment
of
medical
reactionaries
he
dismissed
the
issue
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
my
work
has
moved
far
beyond
anything
the
fda
has
ever
dreamed
of
then
his
look
turned
grave
i
hope
you
give
me
a
chance
to
try
to
help
you
i
been
giving
your
case
a
lot
of
thought
since
our
first
examination
about
what
we
should
do
but
first
let
me
ask
you
do
you
have
a
partner
who
could
come
here
soon
okay
maybe
the
thing
to
do
was
appear
to
play
along
for
a
while
move
under
his
radar
and
then
get
sarah
and
split
it
a
possibility
he
smiled
again
excellent
if
this
person
can
come
here
to
the
clinic
for
a
deposit
then
we
could
put
you
on
a
schedule
one
thing
at
a
time
first
i
like
to
know
exactly
what
it
is
you
have
in
mind
would
his
program
include
stringing
me
out
on
the
toad
drug
the
way
he
done
with
sarah
of
course
he
leaned
forward
in
his
chair
i
believe
that
given
your
history
an
procedure
would
have
the
highest
chance
of
success
you
undoubtedly
know
how
it
works
we
remove
a
number
of
eggs
by
aspiration
and
grade
them
for
maturity
and
viability
after
which
we
fertilize
them
to
begin
embryos
growing
then
we
pick
the
most
promising
for
implantation
in
vitro
is
invasive
and
dangerous
and
there
a
lot
that
can
go
wrong
i
genuinely
hated
the
idea
to
some
extent
he
examined
his
watch
for
a
moment
then
looked
up
but
let
me
just
say
this
since
any
reproductive
therapy
particularly
in
vitro
is
strongly
dependent
on
the
factor
of
timing
i
developed
experimental
compounds
down
here
that
can
regulate
egg
maturities
very
precisely
it
minimizes
a
lot
of
uncertainties
which
is
why
we
so
lucky
you
he
paused
look
the
first
thing
we
need
to
do
is
put
you
on
a
strict
regimen
of
diet
and
spiritual
discipline
using
my
system
for
regulating
your
chi
your
energy
flows
then
if
you
respond
we
can
start
thinking
about
the
procedure
and
should
you
eventually
decide
you
want
to
go
ahead
and
you
can
have
your
partner
come
here
we
could
possibly
have
everything
done
in
just
a
few
days
well
you
can
forget
about
me
taking
any
compounds
how
long
could
i
stall
him
morgan
there
more
to
this
his
look
grew
pained
it
awkward
to
bring
it
up
but
your
presence
here
creates
no
small
difficulty
for
me
i
told
you
certain
people
in
the
military
high
command
have
concerns
about
the
film
you
making
and
then
the
next
thing
they
know
you
show
up
here
it
just
going
to
heighten
their
paranoia
but
if
i
can
convince
them
you
here
for
fertility
treatment
in
any
case
it
important
that
nothing
you
or
i
do
is
at
odds
with
that
presumption
i
hope
it
true
but
even
if
you
chose
to
forgo
it
i
still
need
to
put
you
on
my
normal
regimen
you
understand
that
baloney
somebody
had
me
brought
to
whoever
did
it
knows
full
well
why
i
here
the
problem
is
i
still
do
know
what
they
really
want
well
you
can
say
i
come
to
take
sarah
home
i
told
him
that
seems
reason
enough
the
other
story
is
simpler
to
explain
he
took
a
last
bite
of
gazpacho
then
rested
his
pewter
spoon
on
the
table
take
my
word
for
it
and
what
if
i
do
choose
to
go
along
with
this
charade
we
would
both
be
in
jeopardy
they
entirely
capable
of
things
i
rather
not
have
to
elaborate
on
i
sat
there
feeling
a
chill
envelop
the
room
how
was
i
going
to
get
out
of
this
place
by
the
way
a
while
ago
sarah
mentioned
something
about
a
what
that
it
a
special
time
here
his
gaze
shifted
to
the
ceiling
in
fact
it
supposed
to
take
place
in
three
days
but
the
army
has
informed
me
it
has
to
be
two
days
from
now
that
the
day
they
rotate
the
troops
here
so
there
be
double
strength
but
why
do
they
need
things
can
get
a
bit
frenzied
he
smiled
though
he
seemed
to
be
embarrassed
however
the
people
will
love
the
fact
you
here
to
share
it
with
them
did
he
say
frenzied
my
mind
immediately
flashed
on
the
aztec
rituals
of
ripping
out
beating
hearts
but
the
maya
did
go
to
that
extreme
at
least
so
far
as
i
knew
once
again
though
i
had
the
feeling
i
was
only
hearing
what
he
wanted
me
to
know
not
the
whole
truth
it
felt
like
a
chess
game
where
i
did
know
the
location
of
all
the
pieces
or
how
they
could
move
tell
you
what
he
was
getting
up
turning
toward
the
hall
why
you
let
me
show
you
around
the
clinic
in
fact
i
scheduled
to
perform
an
in
vitro
this
morning
for
a
childless
couple
here
free
to
see
it
perhaps
that
could
help
you
make
your
own
decision
well
do
you
have
a
phone
i
need
to
make
some
calls
would
he
let
me
call
out
that
would
be
a
first
test
of
what
his
intentions
were
it
was
all
getting
so
insidious
i
had
sarah
to
worry
about
and
the
army
and
now
some
kind
of
ceremony
that
he
managed
to
stay
cannily
vague
about
i
only
knew
i
wanted
the
whole
world
to
know
where
i
was
of
course
he
said
you
welcome
to
use
my
office
he
was
pointing
down
the
hall
it
right
this
way
yes
maybe
i
not
completely
his
prisoner
yet
i
still
have
privileges
but
i
damned
well
better
use
them
while
i
can
i
walked
out
and
felt
a
breeze
and
then
i
studied
the
far
end
of
the
hallway
at
the
opposite
end
from
the
entrance
and
noticed
huge
slatted
windows
as
we
walked
in
their
direction
i
realized
there
was
a
stairway
on
one
side
at
the
end
of
the
hall
leading
up
to
the
second
story
of
the
building
what
up
there
hygenic
nursery
rooms
he
glanced
at
the
stairs
unlike
practice
new
mothers
here
are
sent
home
after
a
day
or
two
women
and
their
newborns
are
encouraged
to
stay
here
at
the
clinic
for
at
least
a
week
it
actually
very
much
a
part
of
their
tradition
a
period
of
bonding
you
welcome
to
visit
with
them
later
if
you
like
i
intended
to
in
fact
i
found
myself
looking
around
and
trying
to
memorize
everything
about
the
place
a
building
a
marble
stair
a
nursery
upstairs
downstairs
rooms
along
either
side
of
the
hallway
what
was
in
them
and
an
office
i
was
about
to
see
could
the
clinic
be
locked
down
what
were
the
escape
routes
how
closely
was
the
army
watching
the
time
would
come
i
was
sure
when
i
need
every
scrap
of
intelligence
i
could
collect
when
we
reached
the
end
of
the
hall
the
fresh
cool
wind
still
blowing
against
my
face
he
stopped
in
front
of
a
large
ornate
wooden
door
with
a
brass
knob
in
the
very
center
there
was
no
sign
of
a
lock
just
a
sense
of
great
gravity
about
its
purpose
the
phone
in
here
he
pushed
the
door
and
it
slowly
swung
inward
on
hinges
that
must
have
required
ball
bearings
it
was
indeed
an
office
dimly
lighted
by
the
moving
of
two
computers
each
on
a
separate
desk
he
flicked
on
the
overhead
lights
and
i
noticed
that
one
computer
was
hooked
to
a
fax
machine
the
other
to
a
separate
printer
an
impressive
assembly
of
technology
for
out
here
in
the
rain
forest
then
i
focused
on
the
central
desk
on
which
sat
an
open
box
containing
a
labeled
magellan
world
phone
a
small
satellite
dish
was
bolted
down
next
to
it
it
uplinks
to
the
inmarsat
series
geostationary
satellites
he
indicated
the
dish
but
it
works
like
a
regular
phone
the
international
codes
all
apply
then
he
turned
to
leave
i
should
be
ready
for
the
procedure
in
a
few
minutes
i
picked
up
the
handset
and
flicked
it
on
three
green
diodes
flashed
then
two
yellow
ones
after
which
a
white
light
came
on
and
i
heard
a
continuous
hum
a
dial
tone
hooray
but
was
his
satellite
phone
tapped
why
would
he
let
me
just
call
out
was
this
a
feint
in
our
game
of
just
to
lull
me
into
believing
everything
here
was
safe
and
benign
remembering
sarah
drug
experience
i
already
knew
that
could
be
true
for
now
though
i
had
to
get
an
sos
out
while
i
had
the
chance
i
long
since
memorized
the
number
of
steve
hotel
in
belize
city
and
if
i
could
reach
him
he
could
go
the
embassy
in
guatemala
city
and
i
was
sure
what
i
still
hoped
to
get
out
of
here
on
my
own
but
if
that
failed
maybe
some
of
those
sturdy
marines
when
i
dialed
the
belize
number
however
the
phone
just
rang
and
rang
come
on
somebody
please
pick
up
then
they
did
thank
goodness
but
when
i
asked
for
steve
so
sorry
mon
came
the
proud
caribbean
voice
but
abrams
check
out
monday
early
in
the
morning
right
i
know
that
but
he
came
back
last
night
did
he
no
mon
he
say
he
be
coming
back
to
hold
his
room
but
he
did
come
back
i
felt
my
palms
go
icy
who
was
going
to
know
where
sarah
and
i
were
what
do
you
mean
he
not
coming
back
here
mon
the
man
paused
and
mumbled
something
to
another
clerk
then
came
back
on
nobody
seen
him
since
you
want
leave
a
message
that
okay
but
i
do
know
when
no
i
did
know
what
to
say
the
implication
was
only
gradually
sinking
in
no
message
thanks
anyway
i
try
back
later
any
time
mon
no
problem
i
hung
up
trying
to
stay
calm
steve
where
are
you
okay
i
told
myself
you
do
actually
know
something
wrong
it
could
be
anything
still
it
was
very
worrying
steve
my
one
and
only
i
was
staring
at
the
phone
wondering
what
my
next
move
should
be
whatever
else
i
got
to
try
to
reach
lou
tell
him
i
found
sarah
but
then
what
he
certainly
was
going
to
be
any
help
in
getting
us
out
if
he
blundered
his
way
down
here
there
was
a
real
chance
misread
the
delicacy
of
the
situation
and
end
up
getting
us
all
disappeared
by
the
army
but
still
i
had
to
tell
him
about
her
i
picked
up
the
handset
again
keyed
in
the
country
code
and
tried
the
number
for
his
place
in
soho
he
said
he
was
going
to
be
released
from
vincent
today
so
maybe
he
was
home
by
now
the
familiar
ring
jangled
half
a
dozen
times
and
then
crenshaw
residence
it
was
the
irish
tones
of
reilly
day
nurse
hallelujah
i
guessed
she
was
there
now
taking
care
of
lou
uh
this
is
morgan
james
crenshaw
niece
remember
i
came
by
is
he
home
yet
i
need
to
talk
to
him
he
resting
dear
i
was
just
about
to
go
out
and
get
some
things
milk
and
soup
and
the
like
so
dare
i
ask
how
is
he
he
weak
but
i
think
he
going
to
be
fine
if
people
will
just
let
him
be
look
i
hate
to
bother
him
but
it
really
an
emergency
i
calling
from
guatemala
oh
i
truly
do
know
if
he
awake
dear
he
was
napping
a
while
ago
could
you
could
you
go
and
see
please
and
take
the
phone
just
a
minute
she
sounded
reluctant
but
i
could
hear
her
movements
as
she
shuffled
across
the
loft
i
listened
wondering
how
long
alex
goddard
was
going
to
be
away
and
then
a
moment
later
yeah
there
was
a
rustle
as
lou
got
a
grip
on
his
cordless
morgan
is
that
you
where
the
hell
are
you
now
it
took
me
a
second
to
even
find
my
voice
i
was
so
thrilled
to
hear
him
he
sounded
just
like
always
hey
how
it
going
champ
i
said
come
on
lou
get
well
fight
i
started
having
these
migraines
but
they
gave
me
some
medicine
listen
i
cut
him
off
and
immediately
felt
guilty
i
been
so
impatient
i
up
in
northern
guatemala
and
i
found
sarah
oh
my
god
that
was
followed
by
a
long
silence
probably
an
emotional
meltdown
is
she
all
right
what
was
i
going
to
say
that
she
been
brainwashed
or
worse
by
alex
goddard
that
we
were
both
in
his
clutches
cut
off
from
the
world
and
in
deep
deep
trouble
she
able
to
stand
i
said
i
do
remember
what
white
lies
i
eventually
managed
to
tell
him
i
think
it
was
something
like
she
being
treated
for
a
syndrome
by
a
medical
specialist
i
found
out
that
when
she
was
in
guatemala
before
she
was
given
some
very
bad
drugs
and
someone
here
who
knows
about
them
is
trying
to
reverse
some
of
the
damage
alex
goddard
right
there
was
no
lou
for
very
long
that
bastard
lou
i
going
to
get
her
out
of
here
and
back
home
as
soon
as
possible
everything
going
to
be
all
right
do
worry
it
really
too
complicated
to
try
and
explain
over
the
phone
yeah
well
i
coming
soon
as
i
up
i
gon
na
take
that
son
of
a
bitch
by
the
do
do
you
go
anywhere
i
handling
it
okay
i
heard
him
grunt
whether
from
pain
or
frustration
i
could
be
sure
lou
listen
i
going
to
try
and
phone
you
every
day
if
i
miss
a
day
then
you
should
call
the
embassy
down
here
tell
them
you
fbi
that
might
get
their
attention
the
place
where
i
am
where
sarah

it
a
kind
of
village
in
the
northern
peten
department
i
do
know
if
the
has
any
clout
up
here
but
where
they
should
come
looking
i
got
him
to
write
it
down
and
then
eased
him
off
the
line
as
gently
as
i
could
and
hung
up
i
would
have
loved
for
him
to
be
here
but
i
wanted
to
try
to
get
sarah
out
by
stealth
if
i
could
and
stealth
was
scarcely
lou
style
my
calls
were
one
for
two
and
there
still
was
anybody
to
help
me
the
time
had
come
to
try
david
i
was
having
the
glimmerings
of
a
new
strategy
it
was
lunchtime
in
new
york
but
on
wednesdays
he
usually
just
had
a
sandwich
at
his
desk
maybe
i
could
catch
him
hello
declared
the
british
female
voice
he
put
on
his
machine
hoping
it
would
sound
like
he
had
a
classy
secretary
you
reached
the
office
of
david
roth
president
of
applecore
productions
sorry

the
phone

got
to
talk
to
you
while
the
announcement
kept
running
noises
erupted
outside
in
the
hall
voices
and
a
clicking
sound
as
though
something
was
being
rolled
along
the
tile
floor
shit
was
alex
goddard
about
to
walk
in
my
mouth
went
dry

yelled
as
i
heard
the
receiver
being
lifted

in
from
the
deli
listen

fifth
floor

financial
success
here

hope

handle
the
vulgarity
of
that
david
you
not
going
to
believe
where
i
am
i
began
working
out
my
game
plan
as
i
went
along
trying
to
sound
cool
and
control
my
racing
pulse
i
in
northern
guatemala
at
a
place
that
would
make
a
terrific
feature
it
like
a
maya
theme
park
deep
in
the
rain
forest
but
it
real
i
want
you
to
contact
the
embassy
and
get
them
to
grease
the
way
for
my
crew
to
come
here
this
is
too
good
to
pass
up
i
thought
about
the
costs
and
then
added
at
least
one
camera
and
sound
one
sure
way
to
get
sarah
out
was
to
blow
the
place
open
to
the
world
what
where
are
you
again
i
gave
him
a
glowing
trailer
of
the
qualities
of
baalum
a
beautiful
exciting
recreation
of
times
gone
by
that
disney
the
cable
channels

nicky
russo

by
again
yesterday
he
fully
prepared
to
call
our
note
and
impound
your
original
negative
it
here
under
lock
and
key
but
we
got
to
get
this

thing
for
me
please
i
ca

you
how
important
it

i
have
explained
everything

situation

it
very
threatening
i
need
you
to
at
least
call
the
embassy
down
here
and
see
if
they
send
somebody
the
army
all
over
the
place
and
a
loud
noise
intervened
followed
by
complete
absolute
silence
the
diodes
on
the
panel
all
began
flashing
yellow
shit
had
alex
goddard
been
listening
in
and
decided
to
cut
me
off
before
i
could
get
word
to
the
embassy
i
slammed
the
box
and
went
for
the
usual
maneuver
i
cut
the
connection
and
tried
again
but
nothing
again
and
still
nothing
my
hands
were
trembling
i
just
lost
contact
with
the
outside
world
i
was
completely
isolated
in
the
middle
of
nowhere
how
convenient
alex
goddard
let
me
tell
a
couple
of
people
i
was
physically
okay
and
then
he
blocked
the
line
i
exhaled
settled
into
the
padded
chair
next
to
the
computers
and
tried
to
think
david
david
why
would
you
listen
he
was
so
excited
he
completely
ignored
my
distress
signal
nobody
was
going
to
come
and
help
me
get
out
of
here
i
gazed
around
the
room
wondering
what
to
do
next
was
there
another
phone
a
radio
a
box
of
flares
for
godsake
that
was
when
i
spotted
the
outlines
of
another
door
why
had
i
noticed
it
sooner
this
one
steel
there
on
the
left
alex
goddard
might
walk
in
any
second
now
but
i
had
to
try
to
learn
everything
i
could
as
fast
as
i
could
what
was
going
on
besides
what
was
going
on
alert
for
any
new
sounds
from
outside
i
quickly
went
over
and
tried
the
knob
it
was
locked
tight
figured
now
i
really
wanted
to
know
what
was
in
there
when
i
glanced
around
the
office
i
noticed
a
ring
of
keys
on
the
desk
could
he
have
forgotten
them
more
important
would
i
blow
everything
if
he
caught
me
snooping
in
spite
of
his
attempt
at
a
cool
veneer
he
might
go
ballistic
i
made
a
snap
decision
take
the
chance
and
give
them
a
try
my
hands
were
so
moist
i
had
trouble
holding
the
slippery
keys
but
finally
i
managed
to
shove
in
the
first
one
it
went
in
but
nothing
would
turn
come
on
i
managed
to
wiggle
the
next
one
in
my
hand
trembling
now
but
again
the
knob
would
budge
footsteps
outside
marched
up
to
the
door
and
i
stopped
breathing
but
then
they
moved
on
hurry
i
was
rapidly
losing
hope
when
the
fifth
one
slipped
in
and
the
knob
turned
yes
taking
a
deep
breath
and
working
on
a
story
in
case
alex
goddard
walked
in
i
clicked
the
lock
and
eased
the
door
inward
just
enough
to
look
inside
hello
what
this
the
space
was
a
fully
equipped
medical
research
lab
the
lights
were
off
but
like
the
office
it
was
illuminated
by
the
glow
of
several
crt
screens
stationed
above
a
long
lab
bench
there
also
was
a
large
machine
probably
a
gas
chromatograph
with
its
own
screen
flanked
by
rows
of
test
tubes
finally
there
was
a
large
electronic
microscope
complete
with
video
screen
one
thing
stood
out
though
there
in
the
middle
of
the
workbench
was
a
bronze
dancing
shiva
presiding
over
whatever
was
going
on
it
was
beautiful
so
what
was
the
lord
of
the
dance
giving
his
blessing
to
time
to
try
and
find
out
now
clanking
noises
were
filtering
in
from
out
in
the
hall
along
with
the
pounding
of
heavy
boots
and
my
pulse
jumped
again
was
the
army
coming
to
drag
me
away
just
go
in
do
it
the
crt
screens
were
attached
to
black
metal
containers
their
doors
closed
that
all
were
connected
to
a
power
supply
doubtless
to
maintain
some
temperature
it
looked
like
goddard
was
incubating
something
in
a
carefully
controlled
environment
the
whole
arrangement
was
very
carefully
organized
and
laid
out
finally
i
noticed
a
row
of
large
steel
jugs
six
in
all
near
the
back
and
covered
with
a
sheet
of
black
plastic
thin
like
a
wrap
what
could
they
be
some
kind
of
special
gas
for
use
in
the
lab
voices
in
spanish
drifted
in
from
the
hallway
a
woman
and
a
man
were
arguing
about
something
okay
get
out
of
here
come
back
and
check
this
out
when
around
i
stepped
back
into
the
office
clicked
off
the
thumb
latch
on
the
door
so
it
would
lock
and
closed
it
i
realized
i
was
pouring
sweat
what
next
well
see
if
the
phone
working
again
and
try
calling
the
camino
real
and
see
if
steve
come
back
there
for
some
reason
maybe
a
change
in
plans
it
would
be
a
long
shot
but
still
my
hand
was
shaking
as
i
opened
up
the
phone
case
thank
god
the
diodes
were
all
quiet
maybe
the
steel
door
i
closed
only
moments
before
swung
open
and
alex
goddard
walked
through
did
he
realize
i
left
it
unlocked
how
did
he
get
in
there
was
there
another
door
he
changed
clothes
and
was
wearing
a
pale
blue
surgical
gown
i
shut
the
phone
case
as
though
just
finishing
with
it
could
he
tell
turned
myself
into
a
nervous
wreck
i
tried
to
smile
and
look
normal
but
my
shirt
was
soaking
ah
i
see
you
finished
he
said
not
seeming
to
notice
good
as
i
said
i
got
an
procedure
scheduled
now
for
one
of
the
couples
here
in
the
village
you
welcome
to
observe
it
might
help
you
decide
what
you
want
to
do
in
your
own
case
he
was
moving
across
the
room
you
can
watch
on
the
closed
circuit
he
reached
up
and
snapped
on
a
monitor
bolted
to
the
wall
in
the
corner
oh
just
one
small
word
of
forewarning
he
was
turning
back
down
here
i
made
certain
cosmetic
changes
in
the
procedure
to
keep
patients
anxiety
levels
as
low
as
possible
it
would
be
appropriate
in
your
case
but
well
you
see
before
i
had
time
to
wonder
what
he
meant
he
disappeared
back
through
the
steel
door
with
a
reassuring
smile
chapter
the
monitor
picture
was
in
color
but
the
predominant
hue
was
brown
where
was
this
the
or
had
to
be
somewhere
in
the
clinic
but
still
the
space
looked
flawlessly
sterile
obviously
an
operating
theater
but
it
was
certainly
like
none
other
on
earth
the
walls
were
not
white
or
pale
blue
they
had
the
shade
of
stone
and
were
decorated
with
maya
picture
writing
and
it
was
as
though
a
sacred
chapel
had
been
converted
into
a
surgery
i
guessed
this
was
what
he
meant
by
cosmetic
changes
a
door
was
visible
on
the
right
side
of
the
screen
and
moments
later
alex
goddard
strode
through
coming
in
from
the
hallway
so
it
must
be
right
next
door
god
the
place
looked
ancient
and
haunted
i
watched
as
he
walked
over
to
a
basin
and
scrubbed
his
hands
then
donned
a
white
surgical
mask
next
he
flipped
various
switches
on
the
walls
finally
he
put
on
a
second
mask
that
glistened
like
some
green
crystalline
material
what
was
that
for
then
it
hit
me
a
jade
mask
that
was
something
sarah
had
mentioned
in
her
ramblings
so
she
must
have
seen
this
too
which
meant
not
everything
she
described
was
just
some
hallucination
the
mask
part
was
very
real
now
marcelina
was
rolling
a
steel
operating
table
bearing
a
maya
woman
through
the
doorway
the
patient
looked
like
all
the
others
down
in
baalum
except
that
she
had
a
strange
expression
on
her
face
she
appeared
to
be
tense
and
very
afraid
as
her
eyes
kept
darting
around
the
room
then
to
the
jade
mask
alex
goddard
was
wearing
most
likely
covered
with
shiny
green
granules
when
she
was
in
position
he
walked
to
the
corner
and
flipped
another
switch
whereupon
there
started
the
deep
droning
of
a
chant
probably
from
speakers
in
the
walls
that
sounded
like
kekchi
maya
he
bent
over
her
and
said
something
in
the
same
language
after
which
marcelina
placed
a
rubber
mask
over
her
nose
and
mouth
her
eyes
still
frightened
the
patient
uttered
a
few
words
perhaps
a
final
prayer
then
inhaled
deeply
as
her
eyelids
fluttered
he
turned
and
opened
what
appeared
to
be
some
kind
of
stone
tableau
covered
by
its
own
it
was
i
finally
realized
merely
painted
fiberglass
that
was
what
the
whole
room
was
and
inside
were
crt
monitors
designed
to
display
various
vital
life
functions
as
marcelina
helped
him
he
began
attaching
sensors
to
the
patient
body
when
the
woman
eyes
had
fully
closed
he
removed
his
green
mask
and
tossed
it
into
a
box
it
all
fake
the
room
everything
just
like
but
now
got
sarah
mind
caught
in
his
thrall
i
got
to
make
her
understand
nothing
here
is
real
marcelina
was
carefully
watching
the
screens
her
apprehension
obvious
as
she
fiddled
uncertainly
with
the
knobs
oxygen
steady
her
voice
was
small
and
uneasy
ekg
stable
he
immediately
stripped
away
the
sheet
that
had
been
covering
the
patient
beneath
it
was
an
gown
colored
in
brilliant
stripes
of
red
and
blue
he
pulled
it
back
with
absent
precision
then
turned
to
marcelina
shave
her
and
scrub
her
with
the
woman
now
under
sedation
marcelina
put
on
her
own
surgical
garb
she
pulled
a
blue
plastic
cap
over
her
hair
then
secured
a
white
or
mask
over
her
face
while
she
was
finishing
the
preparations
he
turned
and
walked
to
the
far
side
of
the
room
where
he
abruptly
seemed
to
disappear
through
the
wall
what
there
must
be
a
panel
there
a
camouflaged
door
he
was
gone
for
a
moment
then
reappeared
carrying
a
long
metal
tube
that
looked
to
be
emitting
white
vapor
he
next
opened
yet
another
ersatz
stone
cabinet
to
reveal
a
microscope
with
a
crt
screen
above
it
he
took
out
three
glass
ampules
from
the
tube
frozen
embryos
undoubtedly
and
placed
them
in
a
container
when
he
switched
on
the
microscope
its
crt
screen
showed
him
whatever
he
needed
to
know
interesting
in
surgery
he
was
coldly
efficient
no
human
touch
here
he
was
the
scientist
alex
goddard
next
marcelina
activated
an
ultrasound
scanner
and
began
running
the
wand
over
the
woman
stomach
the
screen
above
the
table
showed
her
uterus
and
her
fallopian
tubes
with
flickering
clarity
he
been
readying
the
embryos
and
now
he
walked
over
and
carefully
inserted
a
needle
into
the
woman
abdomen
ouch
his
eyes
on
the
ultrasound
scan
which
indicated
the
precise
location
of
the
tip
i
watched
as
the
screen
showed
the
needle
on
its
way
to
its
destination
a
thin
hard
line
amidst
the
pulsing
gray
mass
of
her
uterus
seconds
later
all
three
embryos
had
been
implanted
with
such
flawless
precision
it
was
scary
did
i
want
to
undergo
this
deeply
invasive
procedure
at
the
hands
of
alex
goddard
the
very
thought
left
a
dull
ache
in
my
stomach
while
marcelina
bandaged
her
and
began
preparing
her
for
return
to
wherever
she
been
he
turned
off
the
systems
then
closed
their
stone
cabinets
i
thought
back
to
some
of
the
hallucinations
sarah
had
poured
out
she
mentioned
the
green
mask
and
she
also
relived
some
sinister
event
that
seemed
to
her
like
disappearing
down
a
long
white
tunnel
was
that
her
own
anesthesia
did
he
perform
an
in
vitro
on
her
too
i
jumped
as
i
heard
the
bump
thump
bump
sound
of
the
operating
table
being
rolled
out
of
the
or
and
back
down
the
hall
for
some
reason
i
thought
of
the
sound
of
fate
knocking
on
the
door
like
death
coming
to
take
don
giovanni
did
alex
goddard
have
plans
to
take
me
only
with
drugs
and
medical
sleight
of
hand
it
was
going
to
happen
i
switched
off
the
monitor
and
turned
to
stare
at
the
computers
why
were
they
here
in
this
place
of
miracles
what
did
they
hold
maybe
that
was
where
i
should
be
that
was
the
moment
when
the
heavy
office
door
swung
open
and
marcelina
appeared
your
room
is
ready
now
her
english
was
heavily
accented
but
sure
he
sent
me
to
show
you
and
i
can
wash
any
of
your
things
if
you
like
my
room
whoa
since
when
had
i
checked
in
marcelina
we
need
to
talk
what
happened
to
sarah
the
last
time
she
was
here
was
she
operated
on
like
that
woman
just
now
i
also
planned
to
ask
her
about
all
the
bizarre
trappings
surrounding
the
procedure
why
was
the
woman
so
sucked
in
by
his
phony
mardi
gras
mysticism
had
sarah
fallen
for
it
too
sara
was
one
of
the
special
ones
you
are
surely
blessed
too
you
resemble
her
a
lot
she
looked
at
me
affection
in
her
dark
eyes
then
turned
and
headed
out
the
door
but
come
let
me
take
you
up
of
course
i
resembled
her
she
was
my
cousin
but
so
what
i
like
the
odd
way
she
said
it
and
what
about
my
question
watching
her
walk
away
clearly
nervous
i
realized
this
was
the
moment
i
been
dreading
when
i
had
to
make
a
decision
about
how
far
to
play
along
with
alex
goddard
steve
could
be
reached
yet
but
i
still
might
be
able
to
handle
the
situation
on
my
own
the
first
thing
to
do
was
to
get
down
to
sarah
and
talk
some
sense
into
her
then
i
had
to
arrange
for
a
way
to
get
us
both
out
so
probably
the
best
way
to
accomplish
that
was
to
go
along
with
my
own
medical
charade
for
a
few
more
hours
to
give
me
time
to
scout
the
scene
and
come
up
with
a
plan
a
room
would
be
a
base
to
operate
from
still
i
was
feeling
plenty
of
trepidation
as
we
ascended
the
marble
steps
to
the
second
floor
which
had
a
long
carpeted
hallway
with
doors
along
each
side
then
when
we
started
down
the
hall
i
caught
the
sound
of
a
baby
crying
what
this
floor
for
i
remembered
alex
goddard
had
claimed
it
was
to
provide
a
postpartum
bonding
period
but
i
wanted
to
confirm
that
with
my
own
eyes
this
is
the
recovery
ward
and
nursery
here
let
me
show
you
she
paused
and
pushed
open
the
door
nearest
us
i
looked
in
to
see
a
mayan
woman
resting
on
a
high
hospital
bed
and
wearing
a
white
shift
with
an
ornate
wicker
cradle
wide
and
deep
next
to
her
marcelina
smiled
and
said
something
to
her
that
sounded
like
an
apology
for
the
intrusion
the
room
was
lit
only
by
candles
but
i
did
make
out
how
oddly
the
woman
stared
at
me
as
though
she
was
seeing
a
spirit
why
was
that
because
i
was
a
in
the
middle
of
the
forest
but
it
seemed
something
more
the
birth
of
a
child
is
a
sacred
thing
for
us
marcelina
was
discreetly
closing
the
door
again
when
a
woman
carries
a
child
she
will
take
walks
to
the
to
the
river
to
the
orchards
just
so
her
little
one
can
be
in
its
world
then
after
her
baby
is
born
our
tradition
holds
that
she
should
be
alone
with
it
for
a
week
and
a
day
so
their
life
breath
can
become
one
i
could
sense
her
heart
was
deeply
entwined
with
the
people
here
at
baalum
marcelina
how
long
have
well
what
do
you
think
said
a
voice
i
looked
around
to
see
alex
goddard
coming
up
the
stairs
behind
us
and
my
anger
welled
up
again
everything
about
him
was
just
too
manipulating
he
changed
back
to
his
black
sweatshirt
and
jeans
and
was
carrying
a
tray
the
costume
event
was
over
in
an
instant
marcelina
slipped
quietly
around
him
and
headed
back
down
the
stairs
almost
like
a
rabbit
startled
by
a
fox
he
smiled
and
moved
past
me
all
those
trappings
just
now
the
fake
green
mask
i
decided
to
challenge
him
start
forcing
him
to
show
his
hand
what
merely
a
little
harmless
theater
he
looked
back
the
forest
maya
like
to
think
they
being
ministered
to
by
a
shaman
then
he
indicated
i
should
follow
him
by
the
way
in
case
you
do
get
hungry
i
brought
you
something
you
can
have
in
your
room
if
you
like
then
you
can
make
yourself
at
home
and
rest
a
bit
hold
on
i
was
being
given
the
illusion
of
freedom
but
in
reality
i
was
nothing
more
than
his
prisoner
that
room
next
to
your
office
the
steel
door
what
in
that
the
heart
of
pride
in
his
voice
the
real
reason
i
here
you
mean
drug
research
he
nodded
did
you
know
the
central
american
rain
forest
easily
contains
a
hundred
thousand
plant
species
over
half
of
all
pharmaceutical
drugs
are
derived
from
plants
yet
less
than
one
percent
of
those
here
have
been
tested
for
pharmacological
potential
still
the
old
shamans
and
midwives
all
know
of
herbs
they
claim
can
cure
everything
from
menstrual
cramps
to
cancer
he
smiled
they
also
know
which
ones
have
powerful
contraceptive
properties
which
is
particularly
helpful
in
my
primary
study
fertility
and
fetal
viability
i
take
the
specimens
they
bring
and
perform
a
rough
screening
in
the
lab
to
determine
if
they
actually
pharmacologically
active
if
they
do
test
positive
i
then
examine
their
effect
on
the
blastocyst
the
early
form
of
embryonic
cell
formed
just
after
fertilization
to
see
whether
they
affect
cell
division
and
viability
and
the
miscarriage
rate
here
is
very
low
so
some
of
these
plants
his
voice
trailed
off
as
he
pushed
open
the
door
of
a
suite
at
the
end
of
the
hall
it
had
a
stone
floor
a
simple
bed
and
through
the
slatted
windows
the
light
of
midday
filtered
through
along
with
the
birdcalls
of
the
rain
forest
any
other
time
and
place
have
felt
like
i
was
staying
at
a
rustic
nature
retreat
but
this
was
some
other
time
and
place
and
what
about
steve
where
was
he
maybe
he
was
somewhere
worse
thinking
about
him
i
was
startled
to
hear
myself
say
incidentally
i
found
out
the
man
i
been
trying
to
have
a
baby
with
did
show
up
at
his
hotel
in
belize
last
night
he
was
driving
there
from
guatemala
city
i
very
worried
i
keep
hearing
about
how
people
get
in
this
country
he
could
his
name
be
steve
abrams
goddard
turned
back
still
holding
the
tray
it
was
a
moment
that
stopped
my
heart
for
a
second
i
was
even
able
to
speak
how
did
you
know
i
finally
managed
to
say
i
never
mentioned
that
the
name
they
gave
me
i
received
a
call
this
morning
from
guatemala
city
from
colonel
ramos
office
in
fact
as
you
might
suppose
he
well
aware
you
here
and
he
said
you
were
seen
dining
night
before
last
at
a
downtown
restaurant
with
a
man
by
that
name
they
think
he
in
the
country
because
of
you
and
they
trying
to
locate
him
i
felt
the
life
go
entirely
out
of
me
my
god
what
was
going
on
steve
was
now
the
subject
of
a
manhunt
in
a
police
state
did
he
even
know
i
told
them
you
were
here
for
purely
medical
reasons
he
sighed
with
frustration
and
that
they
were
being
irrationally
paranoid
but
so
they
do
actually
know
where
he
is
right
i
was
still
trying
to
breathe
as
of
this
morning
if
they
did
they
would
have
called
up
here
he
walked
over
and
set
the
tray
down
on
a
rustic
table
next
to
the
bed
i
would
worry
too
much
about
it
he
committed
no
crime
they
just
want
to
make
sure
you
realize
your
presence
has
not
gone
unnoticed
dear
god
what
had
i
dragged
steve
into
if
they
found
him
what
would
they
do
i
could
only
pray
he
was
deft
enough
to
elude
them
if
anybody
could
then
i
looked
at
the
tray
an
empty
syringe
was
there
also
there
was
a
large
bowl
containing
some
kind
of
soup
i
was
finally
growing
ravenous
but
still
what
this
for
i
indicated
the
syringe
i
just
need
to
take
a
little
blood
for
some
tests
do
worry
it
wo
hurt
a
bit
hold
on
how
far
do
i
have
to
play
along
to
stay
in
his
chess
game
then
i
glanced
down
again
at
the
tray
and
what
in
that
bowl
right
now
diet
is
crucial
so
i
had
marcelina
prepare
you
a
healthy
broth
of
soy
extract
and
buckwheat
and
rainforest
herbs
that
what
kind
of
rainforest
herbs
exactly
i
was
starving
but
no
way
in
hell
medicinal
ones
part
of
your
program
of
wholeness
he
turned
with
that
faraway
look
of
his
and
opened
the
window
slats
beyond
them
i
could
see
foliage
now
alive
with
flocks
of
multicolored
birds
the
forest
was
in
full
cry
you
know
so
many
drugs
are
waiting
to
be
discovered
up
here
he
was
gazing
out
beyond
this
window
is
a
giant
pharmacy
but
if
it
goes
like
the
rest
of
the
peten
it
soon
be
bulldozed
to
make
way
for
more
cattle
ranches
he
came
back
and
picked
up
the
syringe
that
was
when
i
noticed
it
did
seem
to
be
entirely
empty
it
appeared
to
contain
traces
of
a
yellow
substance
though
maybe
i
was
imagining
look
about
the
blood
test
i
do
think
consider
it
a
free
medical
screening
he
firmly
gripped
my
arm
as
he
plunged
the
needle
into
a
vein
seconds
later
he
was
capping
off
the
syringe
red
with
my
blood
i
running
a
batch
of
tests
this
afternoon
so
one
more
sample
wo
make
any
difference
while
he
swabbed
my
arm
with
alcohol
i
looked
down
again
at
the
bowl
of
broth
he
brought
forget
about
it
i
find
something
in
the
kitchen
later
i
want
to
go
down
and
see
sarah
get
started
immediately
push
and
maybe
i
could
catch
him
off
guard
i
very
worried
about
her
of
course
he
nodded
whenever
you
wish
i
was
thinking
as
soon
as
possible
then
i
send
marcelina
to
take
you
the
minute
she
finished
downstairs
but
i
assumed
you
might
want
to
at
least
unpack
first
with
that
he
disappeared
as
quietly
as
he
come
i
walked
over
and
stared
out
at
the
birds
flitting
past
the
slatted
window
feeling
my
hopes
go
up
the
colors
and
the
freedom
i
wanted
to
be
one
of
them
to
take
sarah
and
just
fly
away
then
feeling
vaguely
drowsy
i
settled
myself
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
the
next
thing
i
knew
though
the
chaotic
music
of
the
birds
had
begun
to
sound
amplified
as
though
they
were
swirling
down
a
long
echoing
hallway
in
spite
of
myself
i
felt
my
consciousness
begin
to
drift
shit
that
needle
he
just
slammed
into
my
arm
it
was
to
take
blood
you
idiot
you
suspected
that
but
he
was
too
fast
shit
shit
shit
do
let
him
do
it
stay
awake
but
now
the
tunnel
was
growing
i
pulled
myself
up
and
staggered
in
slow
motion
to
the
door
and
tried
it
but
it
seemed
to
be
locked
i
could
really
tell
though
because
the
tunnel
was
swallowing
me
no
i
banged
my
head
against
the
door
hoping
the
pain
would
bring
me
back
but
the
room
just
swirled
even
more
the
tunnel
now
it
was
all
around
me
shadowy
and
dim
i
thought
i
glimpsed
sarah
at
the
end
of
it
wearing
a
white
shift
beckoning
me
but
when
i
reached
out
for
her
to
take
us
away
all
i
could
touch
was
empty
mist
chapter
i
on
a
bed
in
a
dreamscape
room
enveloped
in
pastel
fog
watching
a
melania
butterfly
the
size
of
a
man
pump
his
massive
orange
and
black
wings
above
me
his
voice
is
mellifluous
hypnotic
and
i
feel
the
soft
wind
of
his
wings
against
my
face
cooling
scented
enveloping
it
is
the
softness
of
eternal
peace
your
body
is
a
realm
of
fertility
he
is
saying
his
tones
echoing
in
the
shadowy
haze
around
me
sonorous
and
caring
you
are
special
then
iridescent
blues
and
purples
shimmering
off
his
wings
his
face
evolves
into
the
orange
and
black
mask
of
a
jaguar
you
are
one
of
the
special
ones
together
we
will
create
life
did
he
say
special
marcelina
said
i
was
like
sarah
now
his
eyes
are
boring
in
and
i
thinking
of
the
chinese
am
i
human
dreaming
i
a
butterfly
or
am
i
a
butterfly
dreaming
i
human
as
he
moves
over
me
the
rest
of
his
butterfly
form
disappears
and
become
a
lithe
jaguar
whose
lips
are
touching
mine
the
sheet
over
me
melts
into
my
skin
as
the
soft
spotted
fur
of
his
underbelly
presses
onto
me
and
his
face
has
turned
even
more
feline
and
sensuous
with
dark
eyes
that
look
directly
through
me
i
can
feel
his
whiskers
against
me
as
he
sniffs
down
my
body
then
explores
my
groin
with
his
probing
tongue
before
i
realize
what
happening
his
thighs
press
against
mine
and
he
knowingly
insinuates
himself
into
me
it
all
happens
so
naturally
and
effortlessly
i
scarcely
i
see
only
an
intense
twitch
of
his
animal
ears
erect
and
directed
toward
me
as
he
enfolds
me
completely
his
hot
male
breath
urgent
as
he
grinds
his
thighs
against
mine
he
emits
growls
low
in
his
throat
then
nips
lightly
and
lovingly
at
my
cheek
his
pale
fangs
benign
and
delicious
i
cling
to
him
bathed
in
sweat
falling
into
him
wanting
him
but
now
he
changing
my
god
no
he
his
face
is
becoming
a
jade
mask
with
eyes
that
burn
a
fiery
red
a
spirit
of
evil
he
plunging
something
deep
into
me
metal
cold
and
cutting
far
inside
reaching
while
my
mind
fights
through
the
waves
of
pain
that
course
down
my
lower
body
i
struggle
back
but
my
arms
just
pass
through
empty
air
stop
the
eyes
the
hard
metal
time
turns
fluid
minutes
are
hours
lost
and
i
do
know
finally
could
be
years
later
he
growls
one
last
time
and
the
room
begins
fading
to
darkness
then
a
blessed
numbness
washes
over
me
gone
and
i
dream
i
am
dead
sometime
probably
hours
later
i
sensed
my
consciousness
gradually
returning
around
me
the
room
was
still
dark
and
remembering
the
dream
i
came
fully
awake
with
a
start
my
heart
pounding
what
had
it
done
to
me
i
was
shivering
with
a
piercing
pointed
ache
in
my
groin
i
needed
air
i
rose
up
unsteadily
and
reached
out
and
realized
i
was
in
a
hospital
bed
with
metal
bars
along
one
side
what
how
did
i
come
to
be
in
this
then
i
began
remembering
i
was
at
in
alex
goddard
ninos
del
mundo
clinic
and
i
been
trying
to
get
sarah
and
take
her
home
instead
i
passed
out
and
then
an
attack
some
unspeakably
evil
get
out
of
here
now
i
settled
my
feet
onto
the
floor
with
a
surge
of
determination
and
that
was
when
i
sensed
i
was
in
a
different
place
from
where
i
where
i
gazed
around
in
the
dark
then
reached
out
and
felt
something
on
a
table
beside
the
bed
it
was
a
clay
bowl
full
of
wax
what
a
candle
and
next
to
it
i
touched
a
plain
book
of
matches
my
hand
was
trembling
from
the
pain
in
my
groin
but
i
managed
to
light
the
candle
a
flickering
glow
my
wristwatch
was
lying
nearby
on
the
table
someone
must
have
taken
it
off
and
placed
it
there
i
picked
it
up
and
held
it
by
the
candle
and
for
a
moment
i
was
confused
by
the
seconds
ticking
off
then
i
realized
the
time
was
how
could
that
be
it
read
had
i
been
out
for
hours
i
gasped
then
raised
the
candle
and
gazed
around
the
walls
were
brown
stone
or
maybe
they
just
looked
like
stone
yes
now
i
recognized
it
i
was
in
the
operating
room
i
seen
on
alex
goddard
monitor
what
was
i
doing
in
here
my
arm
brushed
against
the
table
and
i
felt
an
odd
sensation
glancing
down
i
realized
there
was
a
on
the
inside
of
my
left
wrist
what
was
that
about
earlier
he
taken
blood
from
my
right
arm
but
then
he
just
swabbed
it
so
why
this
bandage
and
what
in
hell
was
i
doing
in
an
operating
room
i
had
agreed
to
any
procedures
did
he
come
back
for
a
second
or
that
was
what
he
done
he
injected
me
with
an
iv
drug
the
bizarre
vision
i
had
was
his
cover
for
some
perverse
invasion
of
my
body
my
god
i
been
unconscious
since
yesterday
afternoon
during
all
that
time
what
could
he
have
done
to
me
i
was
furious
looking
around
the
operating
room
i
wanted
to
rip
the
place
apart
when
i
tried
to
stand
i
realized
my
groin
was
tender
and
sore
as
hell
all
across
my
only
somewhere
deep
deep
inside
in
my
reproductive
it
was
like
after
he
given
me
those
shots
up
at
quetzal
manor
i
checked
and
saw
no
red
this
time
but
the
pain
was
much
worse
that
sick
dream
was
no
dream
i
been
raped
by
the
bastard
i
pushed
aside
the
pain
edged
across
to
the
door
and
tested
it
unlocked
good
go
find
the
sob
right
now
tear
his
head
off
i
pulled
back
the
door
took
a
deep
breath
and
checked
out
the
hallway
whoa
how
did
they
get
here
in
the
dim
light
i
made
out
two
uniformed
army
privates
down
at
the
end
near
the
slatted
windows
dozing
in
folding
metal
chairs
their
propped
against
the
plaster
wall
why
were
they
here
just
a
cool
breezy
place
to
hang
out
or
were
they
in
place
to
guard
me
the
breeze
was
causing
the
candle
flame
to
cast
flickering
shadows
across
the
hall
so
i
quickly
the
door
now
what
i
was
trembling
as
i
returned
the
candle
bowl
to
the
table
and
sat
down
on
the
bed
soldiers
with
guns
were
outside
my
room
at
five
in
the
morning
in
the
farthest
end
of
guatemala
what
was
i
going
to
do
i
gazed
around
at
the
stone
walls
and
tried
to
think
my
mind
still
felt
clouded
from
whatever
drug
he
given
me
but
it
was
beginning
to
wait
i
saw
alex
goddard
come
into
this
very
room
with
embryos
from
the
lab
which
is
connected
by
the
steel
door
to
his
office
where
there
was
a
phone
time
to
call
the
embassy
get
some
help
to
get
the
hell
out
of
here
i
sat
there
thinking
all
right
i
need
to
wait
an
hour
or
so
now
i
get
some
flunkie
stuck
with
the
graveyard
shift
but
there
was
something
i
was
damned
well
going
to
do
immediately
with
the
lab
right
next
door
i
could
try
to
find
out
why
goddard
had
just
performed
medical
rape
on
me
there
had
to
be
some
connection
according
to
him
the
lab
was
for
plant
research
but
if
that
was
all
he
was
doing
why
was
the
army
here
right
outside
my
door
i
felt
a
pump
of
adrenaline
that
made
me
forget
all
about
my
pain
before
i
got
the
hell
out
of
i
was
going
to
know
what
he
was
really
up
to
here
god
i
feel
miserable
i
really
hurt
all
the
more
reason
i
took
the
candle
stood
up
and
moved
to
the
opposite
wall
to
begin
looking
for
an
opening
in
the
fiberglass
stone
it
appeared
to
have
been
made
from
impressions
from
the
room
atop
the
pyramid
rows
and
rows
of
those
little
glyphs
mixed
in
with
but
there
had
to
be
a
door
somewhere
i
seen
him
walk
right
through
it
as
i
ran
my
hand
along
the
surface
i
was
struck
by
how
their
hardness
felt
like
stone
but
it
could
be
what
was
i
looking
for
there
certainly
were
no
doorknobs
i
came
across
a
hard
crack
next
to
the
of
a
warrior
but
as
i
slid
my
hand
down
it
ended
and
again
there
was
more
rough
stone
solid
damn
i
stood
back
and
studied
the
wall
with
my
candle
he
come
in
from
the
left
which
would
be
about
i
moved
over
and
started
again
this
time
my
fingernail
caught
in
a
crevice
that
ran
directly
down
to
the
floor
then
i
discovered
another
about
two
and
a
half
feet
farther
along
it
had
to
be
the
door
i
felt
along
the
side
wondering
how
to
open
it
till
i
noticed
that
one
of
the
little
stone
glyphs
gave
way
when
i
pressed
it
when
i
put
my
hand
against
it
harder
and
rotated
it
the
panel
clicked
backward
then
swung
inward
yes
and
there
it
was
the
lab
crt
screens
above
the
incubators
gas
chromatograph
in
the
corner
this
according
to
him
was
where
he
tested
the
rainforest
plants
the
shamans
and
midwives
brought
in
but
what
about
what
he
just
done
to
i
was
still
worried
about
the
army
guys
outside
but
i
walked
in
trying
to
be
as
quiet
as
i
could
the
first
thing
i
did
was
head
for
the
row
of
black
boxes
above
the
bench
those
i
assumed
were
being
used
to
maintain
a
for
incubating
plant
specimens
and
sure
enough
the
dimly
lit
windows
revealed
rows
and
rows
of
petri
dishes
they
were
clear
with
circular
indentations
in
the
center
but
wait
a
minute
those
were
just
any
old
lab
dishes
and
no
plant
extracts
were
in
them
either
just
clear
liquid
that
was
odd
very
fishy
i
stood
there
puzzling
and
then
i
remembered
seeing
pictures
of
lab
dishes
like
these
being
used
for
artificially
fertilized
embryos
at
the
beginning
freshly
extracted
human
ova
are
placed
in
an
incubator
for
several
hours
afloat
in
a
medium
that
replicates
the
inside
of
a
female
fallopian
tube
to
mature
them
in
preparation
for
fertilization
goddard
had
said
something
about
tests
on
the
blastocyst
the
first
cellular
material
created
after
fertilization
so
was
he
using
actual
fetuses
my
god
i
felt
like
i
was
starting
to
know
or
guess
a
lot
more
than
he
wanted
me
to
my
thoughts
were
churning
as
i
looked
up
and
studied
the
video
screens
above
the
boxes
it
took
a
moment
but
then
i
figured
out
the
petri
dishes
and
their
chemicals
had
been
placed
in
the
incubators
between
and
last
evening
what
i
started
counting
they
were
in
racks
stacked
in
sets
of
four
by
four
let
see
five
in
this
incubator
five
in
the
next
five
in
the
there
were
over
two
hundred
dishes
in
all
impossible
i
looked
down
at
them
again
feeling
a
chill
nothing
seemed
to
be
in
them
yet
at
least
as
far
as
i
could
tell
but
then
human
eggs
are
microscopic
so
if
ova
were
when
he
supposedly
was
doing
that
vitro
the
mayan
woman
was
he
actually
extracting
eggs
get
serious
that
was
not
where
they
came
from
by
then
i
was
well
along
the
scale
past
denial
and
closing
in
on
anger
but
still
so
many
how
could
they
all
i
turned
and
examined
the
row
of
jugs
at
the
back
of
the
lab
lined
up
six
in
all
now
i
had
to
know
what
was
in
them
i
was
still
shaky
but
i
steadied
myself
walked
over
pulled
back
the
plastic
and
touched
one
it
was
deathly
cold
sweating
in
the
moist
air
when
i
flipped
open
its
top
i
saw
a
faint
wisp
of
vapor
emerge
into
the
twilight
of
the
room
then
it
dawned
on
me
of
course
they
were
containers
he
need
them
to
preserve
fertilized
eggs
embryos
i
lifted
off
the
inside
cover
and
placed
it
carefully
onto
the
bench
where
it
immediately
turned
white
steaming
with
mist
then
i
noticed
a
tiny
metal
rod
hooked
over
the
side
of
the
opening
when
i
pulled
it
up
it
turned
out
to
be
attached
to
a
porous
metal
cylinder
containing
rows
of
glass
tubes
what
feeling
like
i
was
deep
in
a
medical
fourth
dimension
i
took
out
one
of
the
freezing
tubes
it
was
notched
and
marked
with
a
code
labeled
along
the
side
bl
la
bl
lb
lc
and
so
it
went
all
the
way
to
but
nothing
was
there
i
began
checking
the
other
tubes
they
all
were
empty
too
so
why
was
he
freezing
empty
containers
go
with
the
simple
answer
he
getting
them
ready
for
new
embryos
i
slid
the
rod
back
into
the
then
walked
over
and
hoisted
myself
onto
the
lab
bench
next
to
the
dancing
shiva
creator
and
destroyer
and
when
i
did
i
again
felt
a
stab
of
pain
in
my
groin
the
bastard
i
was
shaking
in
the
early
stages
of
shock
more
than
anything
i
just
wanted
to
find
him
and
kill
him
i
thought
i
heard
a
scraping
noise
somewhere
outside
in
the
hall
and
i
froze
was
he
about
to
come
in
and
check
on
his
experiments
then
i
realized
it
was
just
the
building
his
house
of
horrors
creaking
from
the
wind
i
took
one
final
look
at
the
incubators
and
all
the
pain
came
back
the
whole
thing
was
too
much
for
my
body
to
take
in
i
sat
there
trying
to
muster
my
strength
do
stop
now
keep
going
i
got
back
onto
my
feet
the
phone
use
the
telephone
find
steve
alert
the
embassy
then
get
sarah
do
it
now
while
you
still
can
i
was
holding
my
breath
as
i
walked
over
and
pushed
open
the
door
to
the
office
and
looked
in
it
was
empty
and
dark
good
i
headed
straight
for
the
black
case
of
the
magellan
world
phone
when
i
picked
up
the
handset
and
switched
it
on
the
diodes
went
through
their
of
greens
and
yellows
and
then
stabilized
giving
me
a
dial
tone
thank
you
merciful
god
i
decided
to
start
off
by
calling
the
hotel
in
belize
again
on
the
long
shot
that
steve
had
managed
to
get
the
hell
out
of
guatemala
baby
please
be
there
my
watch
said
the
time
was
in
the
morning
but
he
once
told
me
they
manned
the
desk
around
the
clock
no
problem
getting
through
though
the
connection
had
a
lot
of
static
but
then
came
the
news
i
been
dreading
no
steve
abrams
he
still
not
come
back
mon
where
was
he
i
wanted
to
scream
but
i
was
determined
to
keep
a
grip
all
right
try
the
camino
real
and
hope
you
can
get
somebody
awake
who
speaks
english
maybe
he
went
back
please
god
i
had
the
number
memorized
so
i
plugged
it
in
and
i
recognized
the
voice
of
the
guy
who
picked
up
the
owner
son
who
was
trying
his
best
to
learn
english
hi
this
is
morgan
james
remember
me
i
just
calling
to
see
if
there
a
steve
abrams
staying
there
now
hey
senora
james
very
early
yes
there
was
a
pause
as
he
checked
come
on
steve
be
there
please
please
be
somewhere
then
the
voice
came
back
no
nobody
by
that
name
stays
here
okay
shit
it
was
like
a
pit
had
opened
somewhere
deep
in
my
stomach
i
replaced
the
handset
feeling
grateful
that
at
least
the
phone
still
worked
my
last
link
to
sanity
my
next
call
was
going
to
be
to
the
embassy
but
i
could
risk
using
up
my
opening
shot
with
the
graveyard
shift
maybe
by
somebody
with
authority
to
do
something
would
be
there
just
a
few
more
minutes
now
what
i
felt
the
aching
soreness
in
my
groin
again
along
with
a
wave
of
nausea
i
had
to
do
something
anything
just
to
keep
going
to
beat
back
an
anxiety
attack
that
was
when
i
turned
and
stared
at
the
computers
the
little
ducks
drifting
across
the
screens
all
right
you
know
what
he
doing
now
it
time
to
try
and
find
out
why
the
real
why
there
must
be
records
of
what
he
up
to
stored
there
what
else
would
he
have
them
for
clang
clang
clang
a
noise
erupted
from
somewhere
outside
the
window
in
spite
of
myself
i
jumped
then
i
realized
it
was
just
the
odd
call
of
some
forest
bird
god
i
was
cut
out
for
this
now
my
head
was
hurting
stabs
of
pain
but
i
rubbed
at
my
temples
and
sat
down
at
the
first
terminal
i
a
mac
fan
hate
windows
so
i
had
to
start
out
by
experimenting
in
the
movies
people
always
know
how
to
do
this
but
i
had
to
go
with
trial
and
error
error
compounding
error
after
endless
false
starts
that
elicited
utility
screens
i
could
get
rid
of
i
finally
brought
up
an
index
of
files
which
included
a
long
list
of
names
alkaloids
cardiac
glycosides
phenolics
saponins
terpenoids
biology
which
i
hated
was
coming
back
categories
looks
like
he
actually
is
doing
research
on
the
flora
here
but
still
what
does
he
need
my
ova
for
i
scrolled
on
scientific
terms
that
meant
nothing
then
toward
the
end
of
the
alphabetical
list
i
came
to
the
word
quetzal
what
was
that
i
clicked
on
it
and
lo
and
behold
up
came
a
short
list
of
names
six
in
all
organized
by
dates
about
a
year
apart
and
each
a
woman
my
god
first
i
assumed
they
were
patients
from
quetzal
manor
come
here
for
fertility
treatment
though
each
was
indicated
terminated
at
the
end
whatever
that
meant
but
as
i
scanned
down
i
did
want
to
see
what
i
was
seeing
the
name
next
to
the
last
was
crenshaw
she
been
terminated
too
the
bottom
was
james
but
i
had
been
terminated
not
yet
i
slumped
back
in
the
chair
trying
to
breathe
how
much
more
of
this
horror
could
i
handle
finally
i
leaned
forward
again
and
with
a
trembling
hand
clicked
on
crenshaw
a
lot
of
data
popped
up
including
three
important
dates
the
first
was
exactly
three
weeks
after
the
one
in
her
passport
the
guatemalan
entry
visa
the
second
was
ten
months
ago
the
third
eight
months
ago
after
each
was
a
number
followed
by
and
finally
the
count
of
her
extracted
ova
kill
him
just
kill
him
a
lot
of
medical
terminology
i
could
interpret
followed
each
number
but
the
note
at
the
end
required
no
degree
blastocyst
material
from
embryos
after
third
extraction
shows
decrease
in
cellular
viability
no
longer
usable
my
god
had
he
made
her
permanently
sterile
while
that
obscenity
was
sinking
in
i
went
back
and
clicked
on
my
own
name
the
date
was
today
the
number
was
he
just
taken
of
my
ova
i
stared
at
the
screen
and
felt
faint
no
medical
analysis
had
yet
been
entered
but
it
did
matter
i
stared
at
the
screen
feeling
numb
for
a
full
minute
before
clicking
back
to
sarah
page
yes
i
was
right
the
last
date
was
just
six
weeks
before
she
was
found
in
a
coma
down
the
river
from
here
no
more
mystery
he
been
using
her
eggs
to
create
embryos
and
finally
stopped
working
not
special
anymore
so
her
program
had
been
terminated
in
the
river
my
stomach
was
churning
bile
in
my
throat
and
i
thought
i
was
going
to
throw
up
i
took
a
deep
breath
slowly
and
stopped
myself
before
i
got
sarah
and
we
got
the
hell
out
of
i
was
going
to
smash
everything
in
this
lab
it
all
had
just
come
together
those
shots
of
muscle
relaxant
he
gave
me
up
at
quetzal
manor
they
had
to
be
a
cocktail
of
his
proprietary
ovulation
drugs
then
with
my
ovaries
ripening
he
lured
me
here
using
sarah
he
knew
i
come
after
her
next
he
arranged
with
alan
dupre
to
fly
me
here
finally
a
sedative
and
he
harvested
of
my
ova
which
he
now
had
out
there
in
those
incubators
but
what
about
proof
to
show
the
world
morning
sounds
were
building
up
outside
so
i
was
less
worried
whether
the
two
soldiers
in
the
hallway
were
still
asleep
or
not
truthfully
i
was
so
wired
i
no
longer
cared
i
clicked
on
a
printer
and
began
zipping
off
the
files
of
each
woman
he
violated
all
six
disgust
flowed
through
me
like
a
torrent
heart
of
darkness
the
horror
the
horror
alex
goddard
had
used
sarah
in
the
most
unspeakable
way
possible
then
tried
to
have
her
murdered
probably
he
just
turned
her
over
to
colonel
ramos
the
same
thing
must
have
happened
to
those
other
women
all
disappeared
somewhere
in
guatemala
but
who
would
know
one
thing
i
knew
i
was
next
the
printer
was
old
and
loud
but
thankfully
it
was
fast
four
minutes
later
i
had
what
i
need
to
nail
the
criminal
when
i
got
out
of
here
somebody
would
have
to
believe
me
while
i
was
stacking
the
printouts
i
resolved
to
call
the
embassy
right
then
the
hour
be
damned
i
was
sweating
like
a
gazelle
when
the
lion
is
closing
in
alex
goddard
had
just
performed
primal
surgical
rape
on
me
and
now
the
army
was
right
outside
i
had
to
get
the
embassy
and
that
was
when
i
realized
i
did
have
the
number
but
it
had
to
be
in
a
phone
book
somewhere
a
quick
look
around
the
office
did
turn
up
one
i
considered
ringing
the
camino
real
again
to
ask
them
to
look
up
the
number
but
then
i
had
an
inspired
thought
steve
had
said
alan
dupre
number
was
easy
to
remember
because
it
promoted
his
business
what
was
it
i
remember
then
it
came
back
the
number
they
used
in
guatemala
city
call
the
sleazebag
and
ask
him
who
can
get
me
out
of
here
supposed
to
know
everybody
dawn
was
bringing
more
and
more
songs
through
the
thin
slats
of
the
windows
i
walked
over
and
pushed
them
open
running
my
fingers
out
into
the
air
it
felt
cool
the
touch
of
freedom
and
i
thought
for
a
moment
about
bursting
through
to
escape
just
get
sarah
now
instead
i
walked
back
to
the
phone
clenching
my
fists
and
dialed
alan
dupre
number
praying
and
hoping
it
was
where
he
lived
steve
had
called
him
late
in
the
evening
so
it
probably
was
i
thought
i
never
wanted
to
speak
to
him
again
but
now
god
let
him
be
there
the
phone
however
just
rang
and
rang
and
rang
come
on
damn
it
rang
and
rang
some
more
then
finally
who
the
fuck
is
this
we
do
open
till
nine
the
first
sound
of
his
voice
brought
a
wave
of
relief
but
then
his
cocky
attitude
made
me
livid
all
over
again
it
morgan
james
you
shit
why
did
you
leave
me
stranded
up
here
you
have
no
idea
what
oh
you
he
paused
for
a
cigarette
cough
you
made
me
walk
all
the
way
downstairs
just
to
bust
my
chops
what
the
talk
to
me
you
prick
i
still
intended
to
strangle
him
i
need
your
help
you
owe
me
you
have
no
idea
what
hey
lady
you
did
possibly
believe
taking
off
in
that
fucking
hurricane
was
my
let
just
say
i
was
acting
under
duress
i
all
but
did
get
back
well
you
can
start
making
up
for
that
right
now
by
springing
me
the
hell
out
of
here
so
somebody
had
put
him
up
to
it
just
like
thought
all
along
but
who
i
want
you
to
look
up
the
number
for
the
american
embassy
and
tell
me
the
name
of
somebody
there
who
jesus
you
truly
do
get
the
picture
do
you
he
paused
for
another
reefer
hack
i
that
you
missy
it
was
a
high
official
at
that
very
establishment
i
fly
you
up
there
why
the
hell
else
would
i
do
it
for
chrissake
you
know
i
not
a
citizen
of
this
fun
house
said
party
noted
that
if
i
did
he
could
make
a
few
phone
calls
about
my
residency
status
my
pilot
license
let
just
say
it
was
an
offer
i
did
see
fit
to
take
issue
with
oh
my
god
i
felt
like
a
knife
had
just
plunged
into
my
back
was
his
name
barry
morton
please
tell
me
taking
the
fifth
on
that
one
he
said
coughing
again
but
you
got
primal
instincts
i
heard
a
noise
outside
and
sank
lower
in
the
chair
what
was
i
going
to
do
now
listen
do
you
have
any
idea
where
steve
is
they
looking
no
shit
madame
sherlock
i
had
a
long
deeply
uninspiring
interrogation
by
a
couple
of
upscale
assholes
who
showed
up
here
in
an
army
jeep
they
wanted
to
know
where
the
fuck
he
was
when
i
supped
with
him
last
let
me
inform
you
love
you
got
my
old
heartstrings
buddy
in
some
decided
i
feel
guilty
enough
about
that
as
is
so
stop
in
spite
of
all
alex
goddard
had
done
i
felt
horrible
about
steve
like
a
witch
but
do
you
know
where
he
is
now
have
the
foggiest
fucking
idea
never
heard
of
the
jerk
shit
hang
on
the
line
went
silent
and
i
could
feel
my
pulse
pounding
outside
the
office
door
i
heard
footsteps
approaching
down
the
hall
please
god
please
but
then
they
passed
by
terminating
where
the
two
soldiers
had
been
dozing
next
i
heard
the
tones
of
a
solid
in
profane
spanish
heres
un
pedaso
de
mierda
then
came
a
familiar
voice
from
the
receiver
i
could
believe
it
morgy
why
in
hell
did
you
let
alan
take
you
up
there
by
yourself
his
tone
had
a
sadness
and
a
deserved
pique
that
cut
me
to
the
core
i
think
i
stopped
breathing
oh
baby
thank
god
you
i
was
expecting
the
door
to
burst
open
any
moment
men
with
do
you
know
the
army
looking
for
you
completely
nuts
i
got
halfway
to
belize
and
called
the
motel
to
see
how
you
were
doing
and
they
told
me
you
taken
off
with
this
asshole
so
i
turned
around
and
drove
back
here
it
was
after
midnight
and
the
army
thugs
had
just
left
morgy
i
coming
to
get
you
soon
as
the
gas
stations
open
i
know
a
back
road
to
mexico
we
got
to
get
out
of
this
fucking
country
immediately
do
try
to
drive
up
it
too
dangerous
can
you
get
alan
to
fly
you
sarah
here
and
she
been
turned
into
a
space
cadet
i
know
how
i
going
to
pry
her
away
i
stopped
to
try
to
assemble
my
thoughts
he
got
soldiers
watching
me
i
got
to
smuggle
her
out
somehow
i
could
bring
myself
to
tell
him
what
was
really
going
on
let
me
talk
to
dupre
a
second
the
fucker
i
ca
believe
he
did
this
to
you
but
maybe
we
can
come
up
with
something
otherwise
i
may
just
kill
him
with
my
bare
hands
i
heard
a
cough
which
told
me
alan
had
been
listening
in
on
an
extension
it
teed
me
off
but
then
he
did
have
to
be
in
on
this
shit
the
idea
of
relying
on
alan
dupre
for
anything
well
do
it
fast
i
broke
into
alex
goddard
office
to
use
this
phone
and
just
hurry
you
got
it
now
the
sound
of
firm
boot
steps
stormed
past
the
door
headed
out
this
time
after
which
the
two
young
soldiers
began
berating
each
other
in
spanish
falta
tener
cojones
de
tu
chingada
madre
more
and
more
light
was
creeping
through
the
slatted
windows
a
glance
at
my
watch
showed
the
time
to
be
six
sharp
but
the
embassy
was
no
longer
an
option
listen
steve
said
coming
back
on
there
some
rain
due
for
tonight
but
he
says
he
thinks
we
can
try
he
claims
there
a
clearing
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
down
a
gravel
road
that
goes
south
with
the
rain
as
cover
maybe
we
can
put
down
just
after
dark
think
you
can
find
a
way
to
get
sarah
and
meet
us
i
not
even
sure
she
can
walk
at
least
not
far
but
we
be
there
i
was
flashing
on
her
back
in
the
square
proclaiming
her
happiness
would
i
have
to
drag
her
out
carry
her
on
my
back
well
i
would
there
some
kind
of
on
for
tomorrow
morning
the
going
to
be
here
in
double
strength
because
of
it
but
maybe
it
make
for
some
confusion
that
help
still
she
damn
this
is
going
to
be
dicey
honey
let
me
tell
you
as
much
as
i
can
about
the
layout
of
this
place
just
in
case
which
i
did
the
main
problem
was
i
did
know
exactly
where
sarah
was
is
there
anybody
there
who
could
help
you
he
asked
when
i
finished
i
not
hopeful
i
paused
listen
can
you
get
your
hands
on
a
gun
or
guns
what
are
you
do
even
think
about
it
that
the
best
way
to
guarantee
we
all
get
killed
i
not
taking
on
the
guatemalan
armed
forces
and
you
not
either
we
got
to
keep
this
very
the
dark
and
the
rain
that
what
we
use
they
do
shoot
back
at
that
moment
i
wanted
nothing
more
than
to
shoot
alex
goddard
have
done
it
if
i
had
the
chance
happily
but
i
knew
steve
was
right
okay
look
what
time
we
try
to
set
down
about
say
there
was
a
crackle
as
the
yellow
diodes
on
the
phone
erupted
in
a
whistle
cutting
the
connection
no
my
god
had
somebody
been
listening
in
so
when
exactly
was
he
coming
around
dark
that
would
probably
be
about
eight
or
maybe
nine
i
was
closing
the
phone
case
when
i
heard
a
sound
from
outside
as
though
someone
had
passed
the
door
then
come
back
to
listen
all
right
get
going
i
gathered
the
printouts
then
headed
back
through
the
laboratory
where
i
took
a
long
last
look
at
the
petri
dishes
being
incubated
should
i
just
dump
them
now
but
then
he
know
for
sure
that
i
knew
the
time
would
come
and
soon
as
i
eased
myself
back
into
the
or
and
closed
the
door
the
dawn
outside
was
steeped
in
forest
sounds
clacks
and
whistles
and
chirps
that
was
good
because
i
needed
some
stray
noise
to
mask
what
i
was
going
to
do
next
take
control
chapter
i
began
by
feeling
along
the
walls
to
find
where
the
crevices
were
the
doors
that
enclosed
the
medical
instruments
somewhere
i
was
sure
there
was
a
cabinet
that
held
a
complete
set
of
surgical
equipment
when
i
found
the
first
crevice
i
gave
the
wall
on
either
side
a
push
and
sure
enough
the
panel
was
good
the
side
on
the
right
of
the
crevice
popped
open
to
reveal
the
microscope
goddard
had
used
but
nothing
else
was
there
i
moved
on
down
the
wall
testing
for
cabinets
trying
to
remember
what
marcelina
had
done
when
alex
goddard
told
her
to
prep
the
mayan
woman
one
after
another
the
panels
snapped
open
till
yes
this
was
the
one
i
wanted
hallelujah
the
third
drawer
held
the
scalpels
i
took
out
the
largest
i
could
find
heavy
and
steel
then
wedged
it
into
the
metal
sliding
mechanism
and
snapped
off
the
tip
perfect
i
felt
like
i
was
holding
the
key
to
my
escape
as
i
carefully
reclosed
all
the
panels
since
there
were
no
windows
in
the
or
room
i
slipped
back
through
the
lab
it
had
now
become
a
haunted
place
of
monstrous
obscenity
to
me
and
checked
out
the
office
it
was
still
deserted
but
now
the
hazy
light
of
early
day
was
mingling
with
the
sounds
of
nature
seeping
through
the
slatted
window
as
i
walked
over
to
it
the
cool
moist
morning
air
once
again
felt
like
freedom
how
long
did
i
have
before
the
clinic
started
stirring
i
originally
planned
to
try
to
unscrew
some
of
the
slats
but
that
turned
out
to
be
unnecessary
the
strips
of
wood
were
held
in
with
crude
rusty
clamps
and
one
by
one
i
began
prying
them
out
with
the
blunted
scalpel
i
figured
five
slats
should
give
me
enough
space
to
squeeze
through
and
i
already
removed
three
when
i
heard
a
frustrated
voice
in
spanish
just
down
the
hail
que
mear
que
mis
dientes
flotan
it
was
followed
by
the
sound
of
boots
headed
toward
the
office
i
ducked
down
behind
a
desk
holding
my
breath
but
then
the
footsteps
marched
past
headed
for
the
front
door
of
the
clinic
that
was
when
i
finally
processed
what
he
said
i
got
to
piss
so
bad
my
teeth
are
floating
so
where
was
he
headed
moments
later
i
knew
i
heard
the
noise
of
someone
kicking
their
way
through
the
underbrush
till
they
were
right
next
to
the
window
followed
by
the
sound
of
a
zipper
my
god
i
thought
he
right
here
will
he
spot
the
missing
slats
i
bit
my
lip
as
i
listened
to
a
member
of
the
guatemalan
armed
forces
vigorously
urinate
upon
the
north
wall
of
alex
goddard
clinic
well
i
told
myself
that
probably
what
they
think
of
him
i
like
to
do
the
same
then
came
a
confirming
after
which
the
sound
of
slashing
boots
faded
back
into
the
distance
if
he
noticed
the
window
i
just
burgled
it
had
alerted
his
curiosity
moments
later
i
heard
his
heavy
footsteps
returning
up
the
hall
jesus
two
minutes
more
and
i
have
been
out
there
i
was
trembling
but
i
managed
to
finish
prying
out
the
last
two
slats
i
then
pushed
all
five
out
onto
the
ground
hoping
the
clatter
would
be
lost
in
forest
music
and
climbed
through
after
them
trying
to
be
as
quiet
as
i
could
i
ended
up
going
out
headfirst
and
collapsing
onto
the
ground
in
an
unceremonious
crumple
thirty
seconds
later
though
the
slats
were
wedged
roughly
back
into
place
and
i
discarded
the
broken
scalpel
in
the
jungle
underbrush
yes
now
the
cool
air
of
freedom
was
all
around
me
my
first
small
step
how
long
before
alex
goddard
discovers
i
missing
will
i
have
time
to
find
sarah
bring
her
to
her
senses
and
hide
her
from
him
a
lot
would
depend
on
what
kind
of
physical
and
mental
shape
she
was
in
as
i
passed
around
the
parking
lot
gray
clouds
were
thickening
overhead
and
i
noticed
that
half
a
dozen
new
jeeps
were
parked
there
the
army
was
arriving
in
force
getting
ready
for
god
knows
what
i
took
one
look
at
them
and
felt
my
breath
start
coming
in
bursts
steve
we
going
to
need
our
own
kind
of
miracle
how
are
we
going
to
get
out
of
here
i
skirted
the
edges
of
the
lot
and
reached
the
trail
leading
down
into
the
village
and
i
was
trying
to
quell
my
pulse
what
was
down
there
with
the
dense
rain
forest
arching
over
me
i
felt
as
though
i
was
entering
a
domain
of
maya
dreamtime
where
the
past
lived
again
only
with
a
sinister
twist
the
air
in
the
dark
groves
was
thick
with
the
buzzing
of
insects
harbingers
of
the
coming
rainstorm
but
before
long
i
caught
a
glimmer
of
daylight
ahead
soon
i
emerged
into
a
wide
arbor
that
after
another
hundred
feet
opened
onto
the
central
plaza
and
the
pyramid
now
it
was
daylight
but
it
also
was
the
sight
took
my
breath
away
what
was
going
on
a
milling
horde
of
men
was
gathered
in
the
square
and
resinous
torches
were
flaming
on
each
of
the
pyramid
tiers
of
steps
a
lot
of
drinking
from
clay
jugs
was
getting
under
way
and
the
men
were
in
the
process
of
painting
their
faces
stripes
of
black
and
white
with
dark
circles
around
their
eyes
some
also
were
applying
rows
of
seeds
to
their
cheeks
with
white
glue
the
bizarreness
of
the
scene
rippled
through
me
like
the
shards
of
a
dysfunctional
dream
jesus
alex
goddard
had
said
the
ceremony
got
frenzied
and
now
i
was
beginning
to
realize
what
were
they
getting
ready
to
do
had
i
been
wrong
in
thinking
the
classical
maya
never
got
around
to
ripping
out
hearts
did
that
explain
the
young
army
privates
loitering
there
at
the
far
side
rifles
slung
over
their
shoulders
i
melted
back
into
the
trees
and
studied
the
geometry
of
the
plaza
reconsidering
my
situation
i
needed
to
find
some
way
to
get
around
it
and
onto
the
cobblestone
pathway
at
the
far
side
which
led
into
the
village
finally
i
decided
i
could
skirt
the
periphery
if
i
was
careful
not
to
advertise
my
presence
dawn
had
come
and
gone
and
the
quick
light
of
tropical
day
was
arriving
but
everybody
appeared
to
be
with
their
nightmarish
preparations
thank
god
it
worked
i
weaved
in
and
among
the
trees
and
in
five
minutes
i
reached
the
central
pathway
now
deserted
still
barely
letting
myself
breathe
i
turned
back
and
gazed
up
at
the
pyramid
i
had
no
idea
what
was
next
but
i
decided
it
would
be
my
signpost
to
help
me
keep
my
bearings
as
i
moved
through
the
confusing
huts
of
except
for
the
men
in
the
square
the
village
now
seemed
deserted
though
a
pack
of
brown
dogs
curious
and
annoying
had
spotted
me
and
now
circled
around
to
sniff
do
bark
damn
it
that
was
when
i
saw
marcelina
in
her
white
shift
striding
through
the
crowd
of
drinking
men
like
an
alpha
lioness
parting
a
posturing
pride
my
god
my
heart
stopped
for
a
moment
does
alex
goddard
already
know
i
fled
and
has
he
sent
her
to
lure
me
back
no
way
i
clenched
my
fists
and
kicked
at
the
surly
mutts
still
circling
and
nuzzling
as
she
came
closer
i
saw
she
was
smiling
and
carrying
a
brown
wicker
basket
what
i
brought
you
something
she
announced
as
she
walked
up
her
dark
eyes
oddly
kind
you
must
be
starving
by
now
how
did
you
know
i
was
down
here
looking
at
her
earnest
mayan
face
i
suddenly
wondered
if
she
could
have
any
idea
what
alex
goddard
had
done
to
sarah
and
to
me
you
were
gone
from
your
room
she
declared
settling
the
basket
onto
the
walkway
and
beginning
to
open
it
where
else
would
you
be
when
i
looked
i
saw
it
had
a
sealed
container
of
yogurt
a
banana
and
two
eggs
presumably
traditional
safe
food
for
gringos
in
third
world
places
i
been
planning
to
bring
you
down
today
she
went
on
they
all
want
to
meet
you
was
she
coming
to
look
after
me
the
more
i
examined
her
the
more
i
began
to
suspect
something
else
was
going
on
would
she
help
me
get
sarah
out
and
away
from
alex
goddard
i
want
to
find
sarah
i
said
why
not
start
out
with
the
truth
does
he
goddard
know
i
here
he
not
here
now
she
said
her
eyes
shifting
down
he
left
for
guatemala
city
early
this
morning
i
think
to
meet
with
the
army
on
business
yes
his
big
humvee
had
been
in
the
clinic
parking
lot
when
i
went
by
why
had
i
noticed
that
for
the
first
time
i
felt
the
odds
were
tipping
now
was
going
to
be
the
perfect
time
to
get
sarah
yes
yes
yes
if
you
want
to
see
her
i
can
take
you
marcelina
offered
replacing
the
lid
on
the
basket
yes
perfect
i
wanted
to
hug
her
then
let
go
right
now
and
while
i
was
at
it
i
was
determined
to
get
through
to
this
woman
somehow
to
enlist
her
help
as
we
headed
down
the
central
walkway
of
the
village
we
passed
the
rows
of
compounds
where
i
seen
the
women
that
first
morning
none
was
in
evidence
now
and
the
gardens
were
empty
as
though
the
entire
settlement
had
been
evacuated
it
felt
very
strange
and
what
about
those
bizarre
proceedings
now
under
way
in
the
square
was
that
going
to
interfere
with
getting
sarah
out
marcelina
i
pointed
back
toward
the
milling
plaza
what
that
all
about
the
drinking
and
the
it
begun
she
answered
both
simple
and
vague
they
getting
ready
i
did
like
the
way
she
said
it
her
tone
seemed
to
imply
i
was
involved
somehow
ready
for
the
ceremony
they
like
to
drink
a
liquor
we
call
it
very
strong
and
rancid
she
smiled
and
touched
me
take
my
advice
and
avoid
it
i
plan
to
why
did
she
think
i
even
be
offered
it
as
we
hurried
along
two
women
abruptly
appeared
on
a
porch
bowed
and
greeted
us
marcelina
waved
back
then
went
over
and
spoke
earnestly
with
them
for
a
moment
finally
she
turned
and
motioned
for
me
they
invited
you
in
something
about
the
easy
way
it
all
just
happened
felt
as
though
they
been
expecting
me
had
marcelina
trip
down
to
the
village
been
part
of
a
setup
wittingly
or
unwittingly
i
told
them
we
could
only
stay
for
a
minute
she
went
on
i
sensed
she
was
reluctant
but
felt
we
had
no
choice
the
last
thing
i
wanted
to
do
was
this
marcelina
ca
you
tell
them
we
come
back
later
it
it
important
she
was
beckoning
for
me
please
well
i
thought
this
could
give
me
the
time
i
need
the
personal
moment
to
get
through
to
her
even
after
i
locate
sarah
spiriting
her
out
is
going
to
be
simple
i
got
to
make
marcelina
understand
what
really
going
on
then
get
her
to
help
us
as
we
headed
through
the
yard
the
women
smiled
then
politely
led
us
under
the
thatch
overhang
and
into
the
hut
they
both
were
short
and
with
white
shifts
and
broad
faces
and
they
exuded
a
confident
intensity
in
their
bearing
a
powerful
sense
of
i
tried
a
phrase
in
spanish
but
they
just
stared
at
me
as
though
they
never
heard
the
language
then
i
remembered
my
first
attempt
to
ask
about
sarah
the
women
had
understood
me
then
either
or
had
they
the
room
they
ushered
us
into
had
no
windows
but
there
was
cool
shadowy
morning
light
filtering
through
the
upright
wooden
slats
of
the
walls
laying
dim
stripes
across
the
earthen
floor
a
cooking
fire
smoldered
in
a
central
hearth
and
from
the
roof
beams
dangled
dried
gourds
bundles
of
tobacco
netted
bags
of
onions
and
squash
and
several
blocks
of
salt
the
room
smelled
of
ancient
smoke
sweet
and
pungent
they
immediately
produced
a
calabash
bowl
with
a
gray
liquid
inside
pronouncing
the
word
they
urged
it
on
me
smiling
expectantly
it
our
special
drink
marcelina
explained
she
seemed
to
be
wary
watching
me
closely
as
they
handed
it
over
it
how
we
welcome
an
honored
guest
i
was
sure
how
politic
i
ought
to
be
third
world
food
marcelina
i
said
taking
the
bowl
and
trying
to
smile
i
not
really
you
must
have
a
little
she
whispered
back
it
would
be
very
rude
well
i
thought
just
a
taste
i
tried
it
and
realized
it
was
a
dense
gruel
of
cornmeal
and
like
a
lukewarm
gluey
porridge
though
with
a
bitter
but
i
choked
it
down
and
tried
to
look
pleased
marcelina
urged
me
to
have
more
i
took
another
small
sip
and
then
they
produced
corn
dumplings
wrapped
in
large
leaves
together
with
a
pile
of
fiery
chiles
and
a
bowl
of
squash
corn
and
beans
all
mixed
together
after
one
bite
though
marcelina
reached
out
and
her
eyes
downcast
whisked
the
bowls
away
passing
them
back
to
the
women
she
said
something
to
them
then
turned
to
me
eating
too
much
would
be
as
rude
as
not
eating
at
all
that
was
a
cultural
norm
i
did
remember
and
i
suspected
she
just
changed
her
mind
about
the
wisdom
of
my
eating
local
food
i
smiled
at
the
women
and
used
some
of
my
spanish
to
offer
them
thanks
i
nodded
toward
the
bowls
es
muy
they
beamed
as
though
they
understood
me
who
could
say
but
been
intensely
interested
in
watching
me
eat
even
more
than
marcelina
work
on
her
now
marcelina
i
turned
to
her
only
vaguely
noticing
she
had
had
a
bite
do
you
understand
why
goddard
moved
me
down
to
the
operating
room
yesterday
there
in
the
clinic
what
did
he
tell
you
he
said
it
was
for
special
tests
her
voice
was
gentle
through
the
gloom
you
were
very
sleepy
you
must
have
been
very
very
tired
but
he
told
me
something
in
your
blood
work
was
unusual
so
he
had
me
bring
you
down
for
a
pelvic
exam
i
gave
you
a
sedative
she
was
pointing
at
the
still
on
my
arm
the
way
we
always
do
but
then
he
said
you
were
fine
do
you
realize
he
did
things
to
my
body
i
did
agree
to
i
studied
her
trusting
mayan
face
and
tried
to
get
a
sense
of
how
much
she
knew
about
what
was
going
on
that
was
when
i
first
became
sure
of
an
increasing
disquiet
in
her
eyes
as
she
kept
glancing
away
why
was
she
so
uncomfortable
talking
about
alex
goddard
and
i
think
he
did
some
of
those
same
things
to
sarah
goddard
tried
to
help
her
in
many
ways
when
she
was
here
before
marcelina
tone
had
become
odd
and
distant
now
he
wants
to
help
you
too
yes
there
was
definitely
something
uneasy
in
her
eyes
before
he
came
here
she
went
on
trying
to
look
at
me
just
a
poor
simple
village
many
children
died
of
diseases
so
i
left
and
went
to
guatemala
city
to
study
to
become
a
nurse
then
after
he
came
here
i
moved
back
to
help
him
with
his
clinic
the
children
she
was
trying
to
make
a
case
for
him
and
i
noticed
she
avoided
the
actual
question
now
become
a
special
place
she
said
finally
a
place
of
miracles
and
if
a
woman
from
outside
comes
she
can
be
part
of
that
when
sara
was
here
before
i
started
teaching
her
to
speak
our
language
and
the
others
did
too
she
truly
wanted
to
be
part
of
his
miracles
sometimes
we
do
understand
how
they
happen
but
he
has
great
medical
powers
one
thing
for
sure
i
thought
he
got
plenty
of
power
over
the
people
here
including
you
the
whole
place
has
been
brainwashed
i
looked
her
over
and
realized
she
just
gone
on
mental
autopilot
she
wants
to
be
loyal
to
him
and
she
ca
let
herself
believe
something
rotten
in
the
special
paradise
of
listen
i
said
getting
up
i
need
to
go
see
sarah
right
now
her
father
been
in
the
hospital
and
he
not
well
i
spoke
with
him
yesterday
and
he
very
worried
about
her
i
know
goddard
is
treating
her
but
it
better
if
i
just
take
her
home
immediately
more
and
more
i
was
beginning
to
suspect
this
detour
for
the
two
women
had
been
a
diversion
an
attempt
to
stall
marcelina
had
set
it
up
maybe
she
wanted
to
tell
me
something
and
she
did
have
the
nerve
to
do
it
families
are
very
important
she
said
sounding
sincere
we
go
now
she
spoke
to
the
women
briefly
an
animated
benediction
that
seemed
to
leave
her
even
more
disturbed
as
we
headed
out
and
on
down
the
path
i
again
wondered
what
was
really
happening
when
we
reached
the
end
of
the
long
street
the
arched
arbors
still
above
us
she
stopped
in
front
of
an
odd
stone
building
unlike
any
of
the
others
and
pointed
this
is
where
she
likes
to
be
she
said
quietly
except
for
the
pyramid
it
the
most
sacred
place
in
baalum
the
doorway
was
a
stone
arch
about
five
feet
high
and
pointed
at
the
top
like
a
tiny
gothic
cathedral
what
is
this
i
felt
as
though
i
was
about
to
enter
something
from
the
temple
of
doom
it
was
once
the
royal
bath
she
explained
in
ancient
times
heated
rocks
were
brought
in
with
spring
water
from
a
sacred
we
walked
through
the
portal
and
entered
a
room
whose
roof
was
a
stone
latticework
that
let
the
gray
daylight
just
filter
through
the
space
was
vast
with
carved
and
colored
glyphs
all
around
the
walls
while
the
air
was
filled
with
clouds
of
incense
from
pots
along
the
floor
it
felt
like
a
smoky
pagan
church
at
the
far
end
was
a
large
stone
platform
and
in
the
dappled
hazy
light
i
could
see
it
was
embossed
along
its
sides
with
carved
and
painted
classical
scenes
and
glyphs
glistening
little
red
and
green
and
blue
pictures
of
faces
and
figures
my
eyes
finally
started
adjusting
to
the
shadows
and
i
realized
the
platform
had
been
fitted
with
a
covering
across
the
top
a
jaguar
skin
over
bundled
straw
and
a
tiny
form
was
lying
on
it
wearing
a
white
shift
dear
god
morgy
i
been
so
hoping
you
come
sarah
said
rising
up
and
holding
out
her
hands
then
she
slid
her
feet
around
onto
the
rough
stone
floor
and
managed
to
steady
herself
her
shift
was
wrinkled
now
but
she
still
was
wearing
the
brown
slippers
and
the
braided
leather
she
appeared
sleepy
though
her
eyes
were
sparkling
and
she
seemed
to
have
more
strength
than
she
had
when
i
first
saw
her
out
in
the
square
i
looked
at
her
and
weighed
the
chances
she
could
walk
possibly
but
i
carry
her
if
i
had
to
sar
honey
we
going
home
now
i
said
finally
finding
my
voice
she
did
respond
at
first
just
turned
to
caress
the
decorated
sides
of
the
platform
i
been
wanting
to
show
you
this
morgy
it
tells
my
story
her
voice
sounded
as
if
it
were
coming
from
a
long
way
off
as
though
through
a
dense
haze
please
we
do
have
time
for
stories
was
she
hearing
me
at
all
let
just
see
she
went
on
ignoring
me
as
she
pointed
down
that
the
cosmic
monster
that
one
there
with
maize
sprouting
out
of
his
forehead
and
that
man
next
to
him
with
a
flint
knife
is
my
father
letting
blood
from
his
penis
he
the
king
and
that
one
there
is
me
lady
jaguar
he
gave
my
name
to
this
place
she
paused
to
reverently
touch
the
carved
stone
look
i
just
stuck
a
stingray
spine
through
my
tongue
and
put
my
blood
in
the
censer
there
sar
please
here
see
it
she
was
pointing
to
a
section
at
the
very
end
the
vision
serpent
up
above
me
he
the
god
kukulkan
or
something
i
made
him
come
to
me
by
giving
him
my
blood
i
sar
what
in
heaven
name
is
going
on
with
you
i
grabbed
her
and
in
spite
of
myself
shook
her
jesus
the
whole
scene
left
me
in
shock
she
was
sinking
back
deeper
into
her
fantasy
world
was
she
taking
the
drug
again
i
wondered
and
fantasizing
she
was
some
dead
mayan
princess
please
god
no
that
was
when
i
saw
marcelina
walk
over
to
a
shelf
along
the
wall
and
lift
down
another
incense
burner
along
with
a
small
white
brick
what
oh
yes
sarah
exclaimed
moving
quickly
over
to
her
let
do
it
for
morgy
marcelina
nodded
warily
and
handed
her
the
white
brick
then
turned
to
me
she
likes
to
do
incense
it
always
calms
her
this
is
what
the
shamans
use
i
watched
while
sarah
shakily
began
crumbling
pieces
of
the
sticky
substance
into
the
pot
my
god
i
thought
she
truly
truly
lost
it
next
she
inserted
dry
tinder
and
began
trying
to
knock
sparks
into
it
with
a
piece
of
hard
black
jade
and
a
flint
but
she
was
too
weak
and
finally
marcelina
had
to
take
the
flint
and
do
it
for
her
then
as
the
gray
smoke
started
billowing
out
marcelina
began
a
long
chant
shrill
and
strangely
melodic
i
felt
a
chill
creep
down
my
back
when
she
finished
she
turned
her
dark
eyes
on
me
sadly
waiting
what
were
you
saying
i
asked
finally
sensing
she
wanted
me
to
i
was
singing
from
the
popol
vuh
then
she
translated
earth
giver
of
life
help
us
in
our
struggle
against
the
god
of
the
house
of
darkness
wait
a
minute
what
she
saying
who
the
god
of
the
house
of
darkness
could
she
be
talking
about
alex
goddard
i
did
want
to
do
it
she
blurted
out
reaching
out
to
me
her
eyes
even
sadder
but
he
said
you
the
new
special
one
we
had
to
what
the
hell
was
she
talking
about
had
to
what
did
it
have
something
to
do
with
my
visit
to
the
women
in
the
hut
please
stay
here
with
us
she
pleaded
as
she
took
my
hand
do
go
stay
do
even
think
about
it
i
had
sarah
halfway
to
freedom
while
the
army
was
still
getting
its
act
together
we
could
lose
ourselves
someplace
in
the
forest
where
nobody
would
find
us
and
when
steve
got
here
tonight
sar
come
on
it
time
i
pulled
away
from
marcelina
and
slipped
my
arm
around
her
nothing
here
is
what
you
think
it
is
are
we
leaving
she
asked
her
eyes
blank
yes
honey
we
leaving
this
very
minute
the
dense
forest
was
all
about
us
and
i
just
carry
her
into
it
if
i
had
to
in
the
coming
storm
nobody
was
going
to
find
that
when
i
noticed
i
was
beginning
to
have
gastric
rumblings
damn
never
ever
eat
native
food
no
matter
what
the
social
pressure
that
damned
visit
when
i
turned
to
ask
marcelina
if
she
would
help
me
get
sarah
outside
i
noticed
she
been
joined
by
the
two
women
both
still
in
their
white
shifts
who
just
fed
me
the
sickly
sweet
and
more
women
were
behind
them
all
staring
at
me
expectant
as
though
wondering
what
i
would
do
maybe
it
was
my
imagination
or
the
dizziness
that
was
abruptly
growing
around
me
but
it
also
seemed
they
painted
their
faces
with
streaks
of
white
designs
like
the
men
in
the
square
were
putting
on
she
going
to
be
all
right
marcelina
was
saying
but
we
have
to
get
you
back
now
you
need
your
strength
i
needed
it
then
my
stomach
had
really
begun
to
gyrate
and
my
vision
had
started
growing
colored
i
noticed
i
was
sweating
even
though
the
day
was
cooling
down
actually
i
felt
as
though
i
was
about
to
pass
out
what
had
those
women
fed
me
it
was
finally
dawning
on
me
that
marcelina
fearfulness
back
in
the
hut
had
nothing
to
do
with
betraying
alex
goddard
it
was
because
she
knew
she
was
betraying
me
well
damn
her
i
not
going
to
let
alex
goddard
win
no
matter
what
marcelina
please
help
me
i
got
to
get
sarah
out
of
here
now
i
do
know
what
poison
drug
he
giving
her
but
he
driving
her
insane
we
take
care
of
her
she
said
but
i
could
barely
make
out
the
words
they
echoed
bouncing
around
in
my
head
i
really
getting
dizzy
i
glanced
over
again
at
the
women
standing
by
the
door
please
tell
me
what
they
the
elixir
she
said
for
tomorrow
at
sunup
that
when
you
see
his
real
power
i
begun
experiencing
white
spots
before
my
eyes
and
for
some
reason
i
had
a
vision
of
the
army
jeeps
parked
up
the
hill
i
did
know
how
the
two
were
connected
but
in
my
jumbled
thoughts
they
seemed
to
be
just
get
sarah
and
get
out
into
the
air
walk
do
think
and
you
can
do
it
i
pulled
her
next
to
me
and
struggled
toward
the
door
the
women
studying
us
unmoving
morgy
i
missed
you
so
much
sarah
was
saying
slipping
her
arms
around
my
neck
to
help
herself
walk
i
i
ready
to
go
home
i
missed
you
too
i
think
my
heart
was
bursting
as
i
urged
her
on
through
the
stone
portico
at
last
had
something
clicked
that
freed
her
from
alex
goddard
maybe
her
mind
was
finally
becoming
her
own
when
we
got
outside
the
skies
were
growing
ever
more
foreboding
storm
clouds
looming
steve
had
been
right
about
the
coming
rain
but
now
it
seemed
the
perfect
cover
for
us
to
just
get
out
i
took
a
deep
breath
of
the
misty
air
and
forced
myself
to
start
helping
sarah
up
the
cobblestone
path
sar
you
can
walk
i
know
you
can
be
strong
for
both
of
us
i
i
felt
myself
sinking
slowly
to
the
cold
stones
of
the
walkway
the
hard
abrasion
against
my
knees
sarah
tumbling
forward
as
i
pulled
her
down
on
top
of
me
marcelina
arms
around
me
trying
to
hold
me
up
it
was
the
last
real
sensation
i
would
remember
chapter
sarah
was
hovering
around
me
a
sylphlike
presence
as
i
watched
myself
drift
up
the
steps
of
the
pyramid
there
in
the
square
my
senses
waxing
and
waning
like
the
waves
on
a
distant
ocean
shore
there
seemed
to
be
rain
or
fog
or
smoke
but
it
had
a
luminous
purple
cast
one
moment
a
orange
the
next
in
fact
all
the
colors
were
swirling
and
changing
shimmering
from
hue
to
hue
a
pack
of
howler
monkeys
was
cavorting
up
and
down
the
steps
on
my
left
like
circus
harlequins
in
electric
suits
doing
pratfalls
and
huffing
as
they
flew
through
the
air
and
tumbled
one
over
another
sarah
was
floating
silently
beside
me
but
where
was
steve
had
he
come
were
we
escaping
no
i
sensed
his
face
drifting
across
my
sight
like
a
cartoon
cloud
before
dissolving
into
nothingness
he
was
here
i
was
having
the
eeriest
dream
i
ever
had
when
i
reached
the
platform
at
the
pinnacle
i
felt
alex
goddard
clasp
my
arm
and
turn
me
around
to
face
the
plaza
below
they
are
waiting
he
said
pointing
toward
the
hazy
square
i
looked
down
and
at
first
i
could
see
anything
except
rain
and
smoke
but
then
slowly
a
crowd
materialized
the
scattering
of
men
seen
earlier
had
become
an
undulating
sea
of
upturned
faces
painted
with
stripes
and
swirling
circles
of
blue
and
white
and
red
a
garden
of
brilliant
blossoms
they
all
were
looking
up
at
us
at
sarah
and
me
next
he
held
out
a
mirror
whose
reflecting
surface
was
a
polished
silver
metal
behold
yourself
morgan
as
befits
a
royal
one
a
special
one
your
nose
has
been
built
up
with
clay
and
pierced
with
lustrous
blue
feathers
and
a
giant
topaz
your
front
teeth
have
been
filed
to
a
point
and
inlaid
with
jewels
your
royal
skull
has
been
shaped
back
and
flattened
i
gazed
into
the
mirror
and
gasped
i
was
monstrous
a
halloween
harpy
then
he
moved
over
to
a
censer
stationed
there
on
the
edge
of
the
platform
and
began
adding
balls
of
sticky
white
resin
together
with
bark
and
grasses
which
he
ignited
by
the
quick
friction
of
a
fire
stick
spun
by
a
bow
finally
he
turned
to
me
and
held
out
his
hands
now
we
will
make
a
miracle
the
miracle
of
heavy
smoke
from
the
censer
was
pouring
out
into
the
rainy
sky
as
we
started
a
stiff
de
the
strains
of
a
clay
flute
drifting
around
us
was
it
the
ceremony
was
i
dreaming
it
as
the
incense
billowed
our
maya
dreamtime
dance
became
ever
more
intense
and
then
a
faint
form
began
to
writhe
up
out
of
the
haze
between
us
an
undulating
serpent
the
deep
color
of
jade
as
alex
goddard
wrapped
his
arms
around
it
it
began
to
form
into
two
dark
heads
then
pirouette
above
us
finally
as
the
specter
opened
its
mouths
and
gazed
down
on
the
platform
sarah
stepped
toward
it
and
held
out
her
arms
sar
no
i
screamed
to
her
to
get
back
but
as
i
did
the
thing
reached
down
and
swallowed
her
in
flames
it
was
the
come
to
receive
her
sarah
can
you
get
up
now
said
a
voice
cutting
through
the
haze
that
enveloped
my
consciousness
at
first
i
thought
it
was
more
of
the
dream
but
then
someone
was
touching
me
and
i
opened
my
eyes
to
see
marcelina
standing
beside
the
bed
i
was
in
dressed
in
white
and
holding
a
candle
for
a
moment
i
thought
i
was
still
atop
the
rainy
pyramid
but
then
i
felt
the
moistness
of
the
sheets
and
realized
the
storm
id
been
dreaming
of
was
being
blown
in
through
the
slats
of
the
windows
i
was
shivering
marcelina
where
sarah
the
nightmare
had
seemed
so
real
and
now
i
was
hallucinating
having
flashes
of
colors
i
did
want
to
see
i
just
had
the
most
horrible
dream
i
was
on
the
pyramid
and
there
was
smoke
rain
and
some
kind
of
ghastly
it
the
elixir
from
the
toad
it
makes
you
dream
dreams
of
the
old
ones
she
took
my
hand
she
resting
now
he
gave
her
something
to
calm
her
more
drugs
i
thought
angrily
then
i
caught
the
he
alex
goddard
must
be
back
everything
had
gone
wrong
i
got
to
get
her
and
not
now
marcelina
went
on
helping
me
up
come
i
want
to
show
you
the
true
miracle
of
now
is
the
time
you
should
know
the
upstairs
hallway
was
dimly
illuminated
by
rows
of
lights
along
the
floor
as
she
led
me
forward
there
also
was
total
silence
except
for
the
occasional
whimper
of
a
baby
in
one
of
the
rooms
where
was
she
taking
me
when
she
stopped
in
front
of
the
third
door
from
the
end
of
the
hall
i
tried
to
get
my
mental
bearings
i
was
still
hallucinating
in
control
of
only
half
my
mind
to
the
point
where
i
was
sure
i
could
find
my
hand
in
front
of
my
face
but
then
she
tapped
on
the
door
and
when
she
heard
a
voice
inside
something
in
the
kekchi
dialect
she
gently
pushed
it
open
when
we
moved
inside
the
room
was
dark
and
there
was
no
sound
except
a
gasp
from
the
bed
when
the
woman
realized
i
was
a
gringo
the
dim
slant
of
illumination
from
the
doorway
revealed
a
small
night
lamp
just
above
the
head
of
her
bed
and
marcelina
reached
for
it
as
the
light
came
on
a
pale
glow
filling
the
room
i
noticed
the
woman
was
staring
at
me
her
eyes
wide
and
frightened
she
afraid
you
come
for
her
child
marcelina
whispered
pointing
toward
the
bassinet
she
knows
we
have
to
give
him
back
the
woman
was
pure
maya
a
powerful
visage
straight
off
that
upright
stele
in
the
square
i
walked
over
and
took
her
hand
hoping
to
calm
her
fears
then
i
lifted
her
hand
to
my
cheek
and
realized
my
face
was
moist
with
tears
i
held
it
there
for
a
long
moment
till
the
alarm
in
her
eyes
diminished
her
newborn
infant
was
sleeping
quietly
in
a
crib
right
next
to
her
on
the
opposite
side
from
the
table
when
i
looked
closely
at
him
i
finally
understood
everything
i
laid
her
hand
back
onto
the
bed
and
walked
around
while
the
woman
watched
i
pulled
away
the
stripped
red
and
green
coverlet
and
lifted
out
her
groggy
little
boy
tender
and
vulnerable
he
made
a
baby
protest
as
i
cradled
him
then
began
sleepily
probing
my
left
breast
making
me
feel
sad
i
had
no
milk
it
okay
i
whispered
first
to
him
and
then
to
his
mother
the
woman
said
pointing
at
him
i
could
feel
her
deep
maternal
love
his
name
i
asked
in
english
before
i
thought
when
marcelina
translated
the
woman
smiled
and
nodded
then
the
tzotz
started
to
sniffle
so
i
kissed
him
gently
turned
and
took
the
woman
hand
again
there
was
nothing
else
i
could
do
tzotz
was
sarah
incarnate
this
was
no
hallucination
he
had
her
special
blue
eyes
and
her
steep
cheeks
her
high
brow
i
was
holding
her
child
they
are
sent
from
kukulkan
marcelina
was
saying
the
white
god
of
the
plumed
serpent
then
there
the
ceremony
on
the
pyramid
and
they
go
back
the
woman
was
staring
at
me
seemingly
awestruck
then
she
pointed
at
tzotz
and
at
me
saying
something
to
marcelina
finally
the
woman
bowed
her
head
to
me
with
great
reverence
she
says
he
looks
so
much
like
you
marcelina
explained
you
are
surely
the
special
one
the
new
bride
i
was
still
speechless
but
then
i
noticed
the
baby
had
a
little
silver
jaguar
amulet
tied
around
his
wrist
with
a
silken
string
and
on
the
back
as
on
kevin
and
rachel
were
rows
of
lines
and
dots
it
finally
dawned
on
me
they
were
digits
written
in
the
archaic
maya
script
what
could
they
be
maybe
his
birthday
no
i
realized
that
was
far
too
simplistic
this
was
the
original
bar
code
it
was
his
serial
number
for
a
long
moment
it
felt
as
if
time
had
stopped
sarah
and
now
me
we
been
lured
here
to
provide
the
life
force
for
mayan
surrogate
mothers
this
whole
elaborate
recreation
was
about
rainforest
drugs
and
research
into
fertility
it
was
just
a
cover
to
use
the
bodies
of
these
intensely
believing
native
americans
alex
goddard
had
perpetrated
the
greatest
systematic
exploitation
of
another
race
since
slavery
the
difference
was
he
found
a
way
to
get
them
to
give
themselves
willingly
was
definitely
a
place
of
miracles
there
could
scarcely
be
another
isolated
spot
on
earth
where
he
could
find
this
many
sincere
trusting
people
with
powerful
beliefs
he
could
prostitute
and
all
of
it
hidden
deep
in
an
ancient
rainforest
but
i
had
to
be
sure
i
turned
around
leaving
marcelina
to
watch
in
confusion
and
marched
out
into
the
hall
and
into
the
next
room
the
maya
mother
there
cried
out
in
shock
as
i
unceremoniously
strode
over
to
her
crib
and
checked
her
baby
was
the
same
sarah
stamped
all
over
him
my
god
when
i
went
back
marcelina
was
still
trying
to
calm
mother
with
her
bedside
manner
as
i
stood
looking
at
them
the
extent
of
what
was
going
on
finally
settled
in
all
those
new
babies
at
quetzal
manor
even
kevin
and
rachel
they
all
looked
alike
because
they
all
were
from
the
same
woman
the
one
who
was
here
before
sarah
and
now
hers
were
ready
i
was
going
to
be
next
the
new
bride
those
fresh
petri
dishes
down
in
the
lab
my
god
why
did
i
destroy
them
when
i
had
the
chance
so
whose
sperm
would
he
use
of
course
it
would
be
from
the
man
alan
dupre
was
going
to
deliver
to
him
marcelina
do
you
realize
what
happening
i
wanted
to
pound
some
sense
into
her
they
did
have
to
let
him
do
this
to
them
i
know
that
with
miracles
must
come
sadness
she
said
reaching
to
touch
tzotz
tiny
brow
we
all
understand
that
it
not
a
miracle
it
science
do
you
realize
using
you
we
know
he
does
many
things
that
are
magic
he
makes
powerful
medicines
from
the
plants
we
bring
him
and
when
women
want
to
bear
a
child
no
marcelina
i
felt
my
heart
go
out
to
her
and
to
all
the
others
it
black
magic
it
all
a
lie
the
first
thing
to
do
was
go
down
to
the
laboratory
and
dump
every
last
one
of
my
petri
dishes
into
the
sink
ova
and
all
destroy
the
nest
then
call
steve
and
warn
him
i
glanced
at
my
watch
no
the
time
was
he
was
coming
at
nine
last
night
i
was
standing
there
in
horror
unnatural
colors
flitting
across
my
vision
when
i
heard
it
almost
morning
i
jumped
as
alex
goddard
walked
into
the
room
dressed
in
white
hair
falling
around
his
shoulders
he
took
tzotz
from
his
crib
checked
the
number
on
his
amulet
and
then
absently
put
him
back
next
he
examined
me
his
eyes
brimming
with
concern
how
you
feeling
he
placed
his
hand
on
my
brow
when
i
looked
around
for
marcelina
i
realized
she
vanished
where
steve
i
felt
the
bottom
dropping
out
of
my
world
my
whole
body
trembling
if
you
harmed
so
much
as
a
hair
on
his
head
i
he
here
he
said
quietly
i
want
to
see
him
dear
god
what
had
i
done
i
wanted
to
die
he
been
given
something
to
help
him
rest
are
you
sure
you
want
to
disturb
him
i
told
you
i
want
to
see
him
i
could
barely
get
out
the
words
now
if
you
insist
he
just
downstairs
we
slowly
walked
down
the
marble
steps
my
mind
flooding
with
more
and
more
hallucinations
when
we
reached
the
first
floor
he
opened
the
door
of
a
room
adjacent
to
his
office
i
realized
the
window
slats
were
open
sending
a
rush
of
moist
air
across
my
face
then
he
motioned
me
forward
and
clicked
on
the
bedside
light
steve
was
there
on
the
bed
comatose
i
walked
over
and
lifted
his
upper
torso
then
cradled
his
head
in
my
arms
baby
i
love
you
please
forgive
me
please
his
eyes
were
firmly
shut
and
he
did
stir
in
the
slightest
he
was
in
a
deathlike
stupor
and
there
were
large
bruises
on
his
face
and
a
bandage
across
his
nose
then
his
bed
shift
fell
open
and
i
noticed
another
bandage
on
his
groin
you
already
done
it
i
whirled
back
ready
to
kill
the
bastard
as
i
said
he
was
injected
with
a
mild
sedative
he
had
walked
over
and
started
taking
steve
pulse
given
the
condition
he
was
in
i
decided
to
go
with
the
simplest
procedure
possible
after
he
was
brought
in
i
made
a
small
incision
in
the
deferens
extracted
a
substantial
quantity
of
motile
sperm
he
was
turning
down
the
lights
do
worry
i
performed
the
procedure
before
the
last
was
a
swedish
tourist
who
was
in
a
car
accident
up
by
lake
atitlan
and
then
lay
in
a
coma
in
guatemala
city
for
weeks
on
end
i
listened
to
him
my
mind
racing
i
thought
kevin
and
rachel
looked
nordic
big
and
blond
that
swede
must
have
been
their
father
those
ova
of
mine
you
took
the
way
you
stole
sarah
and
all
the
other
women
you
brought
here
you
do
use
them
for
research
i
have
ample
leftover
embryonic
material
here
for
that
he
started
helping
me
onto
the
bed
next
to
steve
now
his
face
was
undulating
through
my
vision
as
though
i
were
seeing
it
in
a
wavy
mirror
please
understand
it
very
expensive
to
run
a
laboratory
up
here
but
the
good
i
doing
you
a
criminal
i
remembered
the
frightened
eyes
of
the
women
upstairs
and
felt
myself
seething
with
anger
no
i
am
in
my
special
way
giving
them
back
a
small
part
of
what
they
had
taken
away
by
people
exactly
like
us
i
providing
them
proof
living
proof
their
truths
are
still
powerful
he
strolled
over
to
the
window
and
looked
out
the
women
come
to
me
for
my
blessing
whenever
they
hope
to
bear
a
child
they
know
that
if
they
wish
i
can
cause
their
first
child
to
be
a
descendant
of
their
white
deity
kukulkan
for
them
it
is
a
sacred
event
they
believe
that
it
was
sickening
i
felt
a
knot
growing
in
my
stomach
even
as
my
hallucinations
flashed
ever
bolder
bright
rainbows
that
flitted
about
the
room
then
wound
themselves
around
me
a
great
philosopher
once
said
all
religions
are
true
who
are
we
to
judge
he
paused
let
me
try
and
explain
something
those
patterns
you
see
the
women
weaving
on
the
fabrics
down
in
baalum
those
patterns
are
actually
just
like
the
designs
on
that
pyramid
but
though
that
pyramid
had
been
buried
and
lost
to
them
for
so
many
years
they
still
made
the
designs
all
those
years
because
those
symbols
are
a
road
map
of
their
unseen
world
not
the
forest
here
where
we
are
now
but
their
real
world
where
the
gods
dwell
who
rule
the
lightning
bolts
the
germination
of
corn
he
was
at
the
door
preparing
to
leave
but
he
paused
they
also
understand
the
special
infants
who
come
are
miracles
that
must
be
returned
they
receive
but
they
also
must
give
now
they
wish
you
to
be
part
of
that
with
that
he
closed
the
door
with
a
swing
of
his
long
hair
a
slam
followed
by
a
hard
click
chapter
as
i
watched
him
depart
hallucinations
swirling
through
my
brain
like
furious
fireworks
i
had
a
bizarre
thought
in
an
ancient
rainforest
all
things
are
still
possible
the
old
fairy
tales
we
grew
up
with
mostly
took
place
in
a
deep
wood
where
evil
could
lurk
unfettered
today
though
the
earth
forests
no
longer
symbolize
the
unknowable
dark
within
us
nowadays
the
ogres
of
our
nightmares
descend
from
outer
space
or
even
from
our
inner
selves
places
we
ca
physically
know
or
subdue
here
though
at
this
very
moment
steve
and
sarah
and
i
were
marooned
in
a
forest
where
horror
still
lived
i
got
off
the
bed
and
steadied
myself
breathing
deeply
forcing
my
brain
to
clear
steve
was
wearing
a
shift
but
his
clothes
were
hanging
from
a
hook
on
the
door
for
a
long
moment
i
just
stared
at
the
bruises
on
his
face
god
baby
what
did
he
do
to
you
no
answer
come
on
love
please
wake
up
he
did
move
but
his
breathing
was
normal
not
labored
i
immediately
decided
i
slap
him
around
if
i
had
to
anything
to
get
him
going
and
able
to
walk
honey
wake
up
please
i
pulled
his
feet
out
of
the
bed
and
slid
them
around
and
onto
the
linoleum
floor
i
did
know
what
kind
of
sedative
he
been
injected
with
but
if
i
had
to
shake
him
out
of
it
fine
this
was
no
time
for
half
measures
come
i
pulled
him
to
his
feet
and
dragged
him
across
the
floor
to
the
slatted
window
at
the
rear
of
the
room
where
the
predawn
sounds
of
the
forest
beyond
filled
the
air
mingled
with
the
rain
what
i
needed
was
a
gallon
of
black
coffee
but
the
wet
breeze
would
have
to
do
it
took
ten
minutes
of
working
on
him
with
me
barely
able
to
hold
a
grasp
on
my
own
reality
but
then
his
eyelids
began
to
flutter
i
kept
talking
to
him
pleading
and
badgering
and
when
he
finally
started
coming
around
i
began
to
walk
him
back
and
forth
in
front
of
the
window
steve
i
thought
i
so
sorry
so
terribly
sorry
i
dragged
you
into
this
can
i
please
lie
down
his
timorous
voice
startled
me
but
it
gave
me
a
burst
of
hope
come
baby
just
walk
a
little
more
try
to
get
the
blood
flowing
and
flush
the
damned
chemicals
out
of
your
brain
morgy
are
you
okay
his
eyes
had
finally
started
to
focus
and
the
first
thing
he
asked
about
was
i
impulsively
hugged
him
i
going
to
be
i
pulled
back
and
examined
him
you
know
where
you
are
he
grinned
with
only
half
his
face
and
i
could
tell
even
that
hurt
then
he
stared
around
the
room
tell
you
one
thing
he
said
this
ai
kansas
anymore
last
thing
i
remember
is
alan
and
i
were
setting
down
then
out
of
nowhere
your
colonel
ramos
and
about
twenty
kid
soldiers
with
were
all
over
us
he
groaned
they
took
me
and
then
he
told
dupre
to
get
back
in
the
chopper
and
disappear
i
think
that
son
of
a
bitch
tipped
ramos
off
we
were
coming
then
ramos
worked
me
over
and
gave
me
an
injection
about
five
minutes
later
i
passed
out
it
the
last
thing
i
remember
ramos
was
he
going
to
kill
us
both
now
that
alex
goddard
had
gotten
everything
he
wanted
i
thought
about
it
and
decided
this
was
not
the
moment
to
share
that
possibility
with
steve
instead
i
turned
him
around
and
lifted
up
his
head
are
you
really
awake
i
loved
this
poor
man
more
than
anything
i
just
wanted
to
hold
him
i
not
but
i
damned
well
better
be
he
tried
unsteadily
to
straighten
up
morgy
before
he
put
me
away
that
ramos
bastard
was
talking
about
me
and
you
in
the
past
tense
like
we
already
been
he
did
know
i
speak
spanish
what
the
hell
going
on
i
was
sure
how
to
tell
him
but
i
was
getting
that
super
energy
god
gives
you
when
you
realize
life
is
no
longer
a
game
we
had
to
get
focused
baby
where
your
passport
i
asked
he
looked
around
then
pointed
to
his
battered
camera
bag
in
the
corner
it
in
there
or
was
central
america
never
leave
home
without
it
he
grimaced
then
lightly
pushed
me
away
and
stood
by
himself
jesus
do
you
know
what
they
doing
you
were
right
all
along
selling
kids
in
the
states
that
ramos
prick
is
running
the
operation
not
to
mention
alex
goddard
slice
of
the
action
and
somebody
at
the
american
embassy
here
is
handling
all
the
paperwork
so
they
can
grease
everything
through
the
ins
but
i
still
do
understand
how
it
is
we
honey
i
know
exactly
what
happening
i
long
since
figured
out
that
alex
goddard
and
colonel
ramos
were
working
hand
in
glove
but
i
still
could
bring
myself
to
tell
him
how
he
and
i
were
going
to
be
used
it
was
just
too
sick
listen
not
long
from
now
i
think
supposed
to
be
taken
down
there
to
the
village
for
some
kind
of
rite
as
part
of
this
whole
disgusting
operation
and
then
after
that
going
to
use
you
do
want
to
hear
we
you
know
ramos
and
a
bunch
of
thugs
are
here
to
take
away
a
batch
of
little
kids
he
rambled
on
not
seeming
to
hear
anything
i
was
saying
he
was
off
in
his
own
world
trying
to
sort
out
things
in
his
head
but
what
i
ca
figure
is
how
can
they
just
take
children
from
here
and
nobody
tries
to
stop
them
are
these
so
terrified
listen
please
now
my
hallucinations
were
returning
in
spite
of
all
i
could
do
trails
of
light
that
glimmered
off
all
the
objects
in
the
room
and
i
did
know
how
much
longer
i
be
coherent
i
have
to
talk
fast
we
got
to
get
sarah
before
daylight
she
down
in
the
village
i
tried
to
get
her
out
of
there
yesterday
but
is
she
okay
he
stared
at
me
and
his
eyes
cleared
for
a
moment
i
mean
is
she
able
to
no
she
not
okay
she
hallucinating
worse
than
ever
i
sure
giving
her
more
drugs
really
heavy
stuff
so
how
hopefully
we
going
right
this
minute
there
a
river
but
if
that
does
work
out
there
something
i
can
do
to
buy
us
a
month
time
alex
goddard
got
a
laboratory
here
just
down
the
hall
in
back
of
his
office
it
the
evil
center
of
this
place
so
if
i
can
get
in
there
and
dump
all
his
petri
dishes
his
culture
mediums
baby
it
all
so
disgusting
but
i
going
to
take
care
of
it
i
was
starting
to
have
real
trouble
just
stringing
words
together
into
sentences
my
hallucinations
were
still
growing
the
loud
whispers
of
light
but
i
did
manage
to
tell
him
how
i
thought
we
could
get
sarah
and
elude
the
army
if
we
did
it
before
sunup
though
my
plan
probably
came
out
pretty
jumbled
yet
i
felt
that
if
we
did
it
together
we
could
take
care
of
each
other
then
with
my
remaining
strength
i
launched
into
action
let
me
check
the
hall
i
just
want
to
shut
down
his
lab
call
it
call
it
insurance
five
minutes
and
then
we
be
out
of
here
it
also
would
be
a
kind
of
justice
to
even
the
score
for
what
done
to
sarah
and
to
me
i
leaned
steve
back
against
the
wall
then
walked
slowly
across
the
tile
floor
to
the
door
and
tested
it
surprise
surprise
it
was
locked
i
again
tried
the
knob
an
old
one
then
again
but
it
budge
just
wiggled
slightly
he
locked
us
in
now
what
then
i
remembered
the
time
steve
and
i
were
in
a
similar
situation
when
we
got
locked
in
my
room
at
the
oloffson
in
just
taken
his
swiss
army
knife
and
unscrewed
the
knob
then
clicked
it
open
he
made
it
look
like
a
piece
of
cake
but
he
had
a
way
of
doing
that
he
was
barely
conscious
so
this
time
i
have
to
do
it
myself
i
glanced
around
at
his
bag
is
your
swiss
still
in
there
i
think
his
mind
seemed
to
be
wandering
then
he
gave
a
weak
i
went
over
and
zipped
it
open
be
there
i
prayed
we
really
could
use
a
break
i
rummaged
through
telephoto
lenses
and
film
canisters
and
underwear
then
i
found
it
zipped
inside
a
baggie
and
stuck
in
a
side
pouch
i
snapped
it
open
and
went
to
work
him
watching
me
his
head
nodding
as
he
struggled
to
stay
conscious
the
main
difference
between
this
time
and
haiti
was
here
i
did
know
what
was
on
the
other
side
and
i
was
having
hallucinations
of
multicolored
snakes
you
doing
great
he
said
finally
seeming
to
come
a
bit
more
alive
and
i
was
out
with
the
screws
off
with
the
knob
in
with
the
small
blade
and
click
maybe
we
just
think
men
mechanical
skills
are
genetically
maybe
it
all
a
secret
plot
to
elicit
awe
i
closed
the
knife
and
shoved
it
back
into
his
bag
then
turned
to
him
honey
i
just
going
to
be
a
second
while
i
gone
practice
walking
be
careful
please
he
gave
a
cautionary
wave
they
do
want
us
leaving
here
alive
just
get
ready
i
quietly
pulled
back
the
door
and
peered
out
into
the
dark
hallway
it
was
empty
abandoned
no
snakes
with
only
a
light
breeze
flowing
through
when
i
stepped
out
the
fresh
air
hit
my
face
and
i
had
a
moment
of
intensity
that
made
me
realize
what
i
really
wanted
to
do
first
and
foremost
was
see
tzotz
one
last
time
a
last
farewell
to
one
of
sarah
children
stupid
yes
a
private
folly
of
the
heart
but
i
had
to
do
it
i
was
halfway
down
the
hall
experiencing
flashes
of
color
before
my
eyes
when
i
heard
a
voice
they
all
praying
for
you
it
almost
time
i
turned
back
startled
barely
able
to
see
finally
i
made
out
marcelina
in
her
white
shift
we
were
standing
a
few
feet
from
the
stairs
where
i
wanted
to
go
and
i
was
tripping
my
reality
almost
gone
i
think
she
knew
that
because
she
reached
out
to
help
me
stand
marcelina
where
sarah
i
grasped
her
hand
which
helped
me
to
keep
my
balance
is
she
still
down
there
in
that
place
she
been
so
looking
forward
to
the
ceremony
she
wants
them
to
bring
her
you
do
know
where
she
is
i
realized
nothing
was
going
to
go
the
way
i
hoped
it
would
they
all
love
her
they
taking
good
care
of
her
well
i
love
her
too
and
i
have
to
get
her
now
i
was
whispering
to
her
trying
to
save
my
strength
marcelina
promise
me
you
stop
all
this
it
so
horrible
so
sad
it
our
life
she
whispered
back
then
turned
her
face
away
i
did
know
what
else
to
say
and
i
was
terrified
alex
goddard
might
materialize
so
without
another
word
i
pulled
away
and
started
up
the
steps
when
i
reached
the
top
of
the
stairs
the
hallway
was
lighted
by
the
string
of
bulbs
along
the
floor
and
i
made
my
way
as
fast
as
i
could
to
my
room
at
the
end
i
pulled
my
passport
out
of
my
bag
along
with
a
charge
card
slipped
them
both
into
my
pants
pocket
and
headed
back
down
the
hall
when
i
got
to
the
door
of
the
room
where
tzotz
and
his
mother
were
i
gave
it
a
gentle
push
and
peered
in
but
the
glow
from
the
lamp
above
the
bed
showed
it
and
the
crib
were
both
empty
no
they
must
have
already
taken
the
children
next
they
be
coming
for
me
i
realized
i
been
a
fool
not
to
head
straight
for
the
lab
i
should
have
just
gone
the
room
went
completely
dark
together
with
the
hallway
a
that
felt
like
a
liquid
washing
over
me
the
main
power
somewhere
had
abruptly
died
or
been
deliberately
shut
off
then
i
heard
a
thunder
of
footsteps
pounding
up
the
steps
hard
boots
on
the
marble
i
made
a
dash
hoping
to
slip
past
them
in
the
dark
hall
i
reached
the
top
of
the
stairs
when
i
felt
a
hand
brush
against
my
face
then
a
grip
circle
around
my
biceps
somebody
had
been
too
quick
i
brought
my
elbow
around
hoping
to
catch
him
in
the
face
bring
him
down
but
instead
it
slammed
against
something
metal
which
clattered
onto
the
floor
came
a
muffled
voice
i
drew
back
and
swung
and
this
time
my
arm
scraped
hard
against
the
flesh
of
a
face
and
the
bastard
staggered
backward
his
grip
loosening
i
twisted
away
and
dropped
to
the
floor
to
begin
searching
for
what
had
fallen
surely
it
was
a
pistol
the
marble
was
cold
against
my
bare
arms
as
i
swept
my
hands
across
the
floor
then
i
ran
my
fingers
down
the
edge
of
the
stair
and
there
it
was
on
the
first
step
my
left
hand
closed
around
the
cold
barrel
of
an
automatic
i
shifted
it
to
my
right
grasping
the
plastic
grip
not
entirely
sure
what
i
should
do
with
it
but
at
least
i
had
a
gun
i
never
actually
held
a
real
one
before
but
it
was
heavy
and
i
assumed
it
was
ready
to
fire
i
was
halfway
down
the
first
set
of
stairs
on
my
way
to
the
landing
when
i
felt
an
arm
slip
around
my
neck
i
ducked
and
twisted
away
stumbling
down
the
last
three
or
four
steps
and
landed
on
my
feet
staggering
back
against
the
wall
to
regain
my
balance
all
i
knew
was
the
next
steps
loomed
somewhere
to
my
right
just
a
few
more
feet
but
he
was
there
again
moving
between
me
and
the
final
stairs
get
around
him
i
told
myself
but
at
that
moment
he
grabbed
me
at
the
waist
dancing
in
the
dark
but
the
swirl
had
no
music
and
no
swing
just
a
quick
dizzying
pirouette
i
aimed
the
pistol
as
close
as
i
could
to
his
face
and
pulled
the
hard
metal
trigger
blinding
light
a
face
lost
in
the
burst
of
flame
stars
filling
my
head
the
fiery
explosion
tongued
out
past
his
ear
like
a
brilliant
sword
of
reds
and
yellows
sending
a
round
off
into
space
the
noise
left
a
ringing
in
my
ears
and
multicolored
hues
stuttering
across
my
eyes
it
hit
me
who
i
just
seen
it
was
ramos
with
a
gun
shit
the
flash
of
my
pistol
had
given
me
the
advantage
for
a
second
since
i
knew
it
was
coming
and
with
that
edge
i
swung
an
elbow
across
his
chin
then
kneed
him
in
the
groin
it
should
have
been
enough
to
bring
him
down
but
instead
he
merely
sank
to
one
knee
and
redoubled
his
grip
hey
i
thought
maybe
i
know
something
he
does
how
to
take
a
fall
i
seen
enough
movie
stunts
to
know
what
you
supposed
to
do
be
risky
but
i
knew
i
was
going
to
win
a
wrestling
match
i
opened
up
with
the
automatic
firing
everywhere
again
and
again
and
again
getting
off
five
rounds
in
a
crescendo
of
light
and
sound
like
a
huge
firecracker
in
my
hand
enough
to
illuminate
the
stairwell
like
a
strobe
and
catch
him
off
guard
in
that
fleeting
moment
i
slipped
a
foot
behind
his
ankle
and
shoved
i
think
i
yelled
as
i
felt
myself
being
pulled
forward
then
i
realized
he
was
wearing
a
heavy
bracelet
that
had
tangled
in
my
hair
i
been
planning
to
roll
down
the
remaining
stairs
protecting
my
head
and
let
him
bounce
but
the
pull
of
his
bracelet
ruined
it
i
felt
myself
being
swept
into
empty
space
my
gun
flying
away
then
something
glanced
off
my
face
the
wooden
banister
of
the
stair
which
had
mysteriously
come
up
to
meet
me
i
turned
and
felt
his
body
beneath
mine
arms
flailing
a
soft
landing
till
we
rolled
and
i
was
beneath
him
again
i
struck
out
a
right
fist
and
he
fell
away
his
bracelet
disentangling
as
he
tumbled
farther
down
the
stairs
then
i
rose
and
tried
to
take
a
step
but
it
was
there
in
the
pitch
dark
the
angle
was
wrong
off
by
just
inches
and
as
i
toppled
forward
into
empty
space
i
reached
out
taking
a
handful
of
dark
air
finally
i
felt
something
clenching
my
wrist
and
the
next
thing
i
knew
i
was
being
swung
around
i
twisted
sideways
one
last
time
but
then
my
head
hit
the
wall
the
hard
marble
caught
me
just
above
the
ear
and
i
saw
the
darkness
of
the
space
grow
brilliantly
light
then
transmute
to
vibrant
colors
or
maybe
the
hall
lights
had
come
back
on
i
only
know
i
felt
a
set
of
arms
encircle
me
come
alex
goddard
was
saying
as
he
lifted
me
up
they
ready
chapter
when
we
reached
the
parking
lot
several
more
army
thugs
were
waiting
now
khaki
shirts
and
dense
mustaches
the
regulation
sunglasses
even
though
it
was
still
dark
with
automatics
in
holsters
at
their
belt
i
took
one
look
at
them
and
i
think
i
blacked
out
steve
and
i
were
about
to
disappear
and
possibly
sarah
too
probably
in
another
hour
or
two
my
tattered
mind
finally
just
slipped
away
soon
afterward
i
sensed
myself
being
transported
in
a
large
vehicle
and
after
that
i
was
being
carried
up
up
as
though
i
were
floating
into
the
coming
dawn
when
i
regained
consciousness
i
realized
i
was
standing
in
a
rainstorm
near
a
small
stone
building
a
dozen
army
men
were
huddled
inside
shielding
their
cigarettes
from
the
blowing
rain
while
they
guarded
a
row
of
bassinets
around
me
censers
were
spewing
smoke
into
the
soggy
air
i
became
aware
of
the
cooling
sensation
of
the
fresh
rain
across
my
face
and
wondered
if
it
might
clear
some
of
the
toad
venom
surely
that
was
what
it
was
from
my
brain
maybe
it
was
working
instead
of
seeing
vivid
colors
everywhere
i
was
abruptly
experiencing
a
hyper
acute
clarity
of
every
sensation
the
stones
beneath
my
bare
feet
were
becoming
so
articulated
i
felt
as
though
i
could
number
every
granule
every
crystal
every
atom
the
paintings
and
carvings
on
the
lintel
above
the
door
to
the
stone
room
i
recognized
it
as
where
i
spent
the
first
night
sparkled
leapt
out
at
me
stand
there
on
the
edge
of
the
platform
alex
goddard
commanded
urging
me
forward
it
was
only
then
i
realized
we
come
up
the
back
steps
of
the
pyramid
where
the
men
had
parked
their
black
land
rovers
unnoticed
and
ready
looking
down
at
the
crowd
of
people
gathered
in
the
square
i
realized
they
could
really
see
much
of
what
was
going
on
atop
the
pyramid
to
them
it
was
just
a
cloud
of
smoke
and
foggy
rain
although
the
sun
was
starting
to
brighten
the
east
the
only
real
light
still
came
from
the
torches
stationed
around
the
plaza
then
like
a
ghost
materializing
out
of
the
mist
marcelina
moved
up
the
steep
front
steps
leading
a
line
of
maya
mothers
from
the
clinic
i
counted
twelve
each
carrying
her
newborn
the
special
baby
she
would
give
back
to
kukulkan
perhaps
the
way
abraham
of
the
old
testament
offered
up
his
son
isaac
in
sacrifice
to
jehovah
it
was
a
sight
i
shall
never
forget
the
sadness
but
also
the
unmistakable
reverence
in
their
eyes
i
wanted
to
yell
at
them
to
run
to
take
sarah
votive
babies
and
disappear
into
the
forest
but
i
did
have
the
words
next
the
women
arrayed
themselves
in
a
line
across
the
front
of
the
pyramid
facing
not
the
crowd
below
but
toward
alex
goddard
and
me
then
holding
out
a
obsidian
knife
he
walked
down
the
line
allowing
each
woman
to
touch
her
forehead
against
its
flint
blade
i
assumed
each
one
believed
it
was
the
instrument
that
would
take
her
child
life
ceremonially
sending
it
back
to
the
maya
otherworld
whence
it
came
had
he
drugged
them
too
i
fleetingly
wondered
hypnotized
them
or
given
them
some
potion
to
prevent
them
from
comprehending
what
was
really
going
on
i
kept
remembering
a
hundred
other
insane
episodes
of
immortal
yearning
leading
to
a
mass
transport
to
some
other
plane
this
i
thought
must
be
what
it
was
like
in
the
jungles
of
jonestown
that
morning
and
alex
goddard
was
their
jim
jones
the
spiritual
leader
of
the
moral
travesty
he
imposed
upon
the
lost
village
of
baalum
i
was
going
to
stop
it
somehow
by
god
i
was
i
stared
at
the
women
and
felt
so
sad
at
the
sight
of
the
blankets
they
held
their
babies
in
primary
greens
and
reds
and
blues
lovingly
woven
into
shimmering
patterns
that
mirrored
the
symbols
across
the
sides
of
the
stone
room
their
faces
especially
their
eyes
were
transcendent
in
a
kind
of
chiaroscuro
of
darkest
blacks
and
purest
whites
as
though
all
their
humanity
had
been
caught
by
their
blankets
and
shawls
surely
created
for
this
ultimate
moment
and
the
mother
of
tzotz
was
there
carrying
him
the
baby
i
so
wanted
to
hold
one
last
time
next
alex
goddard
emerged
from
the
stone
room
bearing
a
basket
filled
with
sheets
of
white
he
approached
tzotz
mother
then
took
a
wide
section
of
the
paper
and
secured
it
around
her
face
with
a
silk
cord
covering
her
vision
down
the
line
one
after
another
he
carefully
blindfolded
the
women
while
they
stood
passively
some
crying
from
joy
or
sorrow
i
could
not
tell
finally
at
the
last
he
also
covered
marcelina
face
so
she
not
supposed
to
know
what
really
happening
supposed
to
know
except
him
and
me
and
of
course
ramos
and
the
secret
police
and
whoever
else
is
in
on
this
crime
but
secretly
she
does
know
the
god
of
the
house
of
darkness
when
he
finished
he
put
down
the
basket
then
turned
to
me
stand
at
the
front
edge
of
the
platform
and
lift
your
hands
in
benediction
they
all
want
to
see
you
the
new
bride
i
took
a
couple
of
steps
then
looked
back
to
see
him
adding
more
to
the
main
censer
sending
a
fresh
cloud
of
smoke
billowing
out
into
the
rain
as
the
incense
poured
around
us
the
army
thugs
who
been
loitering
at
the
back
of
the
stone
room
began
coming
forward
each
carrying
one
of
the
bassinets
they
set
them
down
on
the
stones
ready
to
start
taking
the
children
my
outraged
mind
flashed
on
ghirlandajo
massacre
of
the
innocents
here
though
children
were
being
stabbed
to
death
they
were
being
kidnapped
and
stolen
revulsion
pierced
through
me
as
though
i
been
hit
by
a
jagged
shaft
of
lightning
but
instead
of
being
knocked
down
i
was
energized
or
maybe
the
final
effects
of
the
toad
venom
were
giving
me
a
spurt
of
adrenaline
letting
his
criminal
charade
continue
one
second
longer
became
unbearable
what
would
happen
to
me
i
did
know
but
i
could
let
it
go
on
no
i
yelled
startling
myself
by
the
sound
of
my
own
voice
in
god
name
stop
the
rain
was
growing
more
intense
and
i
was
soaked
and
but
before
i
could
think
i
found
myself
stalking
over
to
mother
shouting
at
her
the
next
thing
i
knew
i
was
ripping
the
paper
from
her
frightened
eyes
i
hugged
her
as
best
i
could
then
yelled
back
at
marcelina
tell
them
all
to
take
off
their
blindfolds
this
is
obscene
then
i
went
on
autopilot
shutting
out
everything
around
me
the
rain
the
perilous
sides
of
the
pyramid
the
thugs
even
alex
goddard
the
way
i
remember
it
now
it
all
took
place
in
slow
motion
like
some
underwater
dream
sequence
but
surely
it
was
just
the
opposite
anyway
i
do
know
i
snapped
i
started
shouting
again
and
with
the
hoods
momentarily
frozen
i
started
flinging
the
bassinets
down
the
steep
side
of
the
pyramid
where
they
just
bounced
away
into
the
rain
as
i
watched
them
disappearing
one
after
another
i
felt
marvelously
emboldened
i
would
throw
one
and
watch
it
go
flying
and
then
i
would
throw
another
yes
damn
it
yes
i
wanted
to
show
anybody
with
two
eyes
that
it
was
all
a
sham
once
they
realized
what
was
really
happening
surely
they
would
rise
up
and
drive
alex
goddard
from
their
home
for
a
moment
it
seemed
to
be
working
a
stunned
silence
was
slowly
spreading
over
the
square
while
everybody
around
me
was
paralyzed
like
waxworks
maybe
it
the
same
way
you
temporarily
caught
off
guard
when
a
stranger
on
the
street
goes
berserk
by
the
time
i
flung
away
the
last
bassinet
the
women
had
all
removed
their
blindfolds
and
were
staring
at
me
dumbfounded
finally
tzotz
mother
whispered
something
to
marcelina
and
she
turned
to
me
she
wants
to
know
why
you
angry
you
the
bride
they
only
want
to
please
you
angry
i
was
terrified
but
also
fighting
mad
marcelina
this
is
all
a
ghastly
lie
i
finished
throwing
and
i
was
moving
to
the
next
stage
get
control
could
he
risk
killing
me
in
front
of
all
these
people
tell
them
to
take
their
babies
and
hide
in
the
forest
that
was
when
i
heard
a
cry
that
pierced
through
the
rain
and
across
the
square
beyond
and
i
turned
back
to
see
alex
goddard
shoving
toward
me
he
coming
to
murder
me
since
i
exposed
him
but
i
let
it
happen
without
a
fight
i
clenched
my
fists
waiting
feeling
my
adrenaline
surge
instead
though
he
just
brushed
past
me
headed
toward
the
edge
of
the
platform
at
first
i
did
know
why
but
he
was
intent
on
something
off
in
the
mist
his
open
hands
thrust
up
at
the
rainy
skies
that
was
when
i
heard
the
guatemalan
army
hoods
yelling
curses
ala
chingada
they
also
were
staring
off
to
the
south
in
the
same
direction
had
they
noticed
i
just
dismantled
their
sick
pageant
i
wanted
a
reaction
that
would
drive
home
the
truth
to
marcelina
to
the
mothers
to
everyone
damn
it
look
at
me
i
yelled
first
at
him
and
then
at
the
thugs
but
their
focus
still
was
on
something
beyond
the
square
finally
i
turned
following
their
gaze
and
for
a
second
i
too
forgot
all
about
everything
else
an
intense
red
glow
was
illuminating
the
morning
sky
from
the
direction
of
the
clinic
a
vibrant
electric
rose
weaving
its
hues
in
the
mist
then
i
saw
spewing
spikes
of
flame
orange
and
yellow
dancing
over
the
top
of
the
clinic
there
was
a
finality
about
it
that
momentarily
took
my
breath
away
then
it
hit
me
steve
in
there
it
was
a
horror
that
in
my
initial
shock
i
could
actually
process
the
thought
just
hovering
in
the
recesses
of
my
brain
defying
me
to
accept
it
then
alex
goddard
turned
back
shouting
at
the
army
men
in
rapid
spanish
i
recognized
the
word
for
fire
that
galvanized
them
to
action
they
snapped
out
of
their
mental
paralysis
and
headed
down
the
pyramid
toward
two
land
rovers
parked
at
the
back
next
he
turned
around
and
fixed
his
gaze
on
me
at
last
he
knew
knew
he
was
capable
of
unspeakable
evil
and
i
knew
he
knew
i
would
do
everything
in
my
power
to
stop
him
all
my
records
his
voice
sounded
as
though
it
was
coming
from
another
world
and
it
held
a
sadness
that
touched
even
me
you
have
no
idea
what
been
lost
he
was
distraught
but
also
obsessed
with
his
wild
mane
of
hair
he
did
finally
look
like
shiva
the
destroyer
he
stalked
over
and
seized
the
obsidian
knife
then
turned
toward
me
i
looked
for
something
to
defend
myself
with
the
bassinets
which
i
might
have
used
as
a
shield
were
gone
i
only
had
my
bare
hands
i
had
to
get
away
from
him
get
down
the
pyramid
and
find
sarah
and
steve
but
as
i
started
toward
the
front
steps
the
women
were
all
clustered
there
blocking
my
way
then
for
no
reason
i
could
understand
the
mother
of
tzotz
stepped
out
of
the
group
and
handed
me
her
baby
saying
something
in
kekchi
maya
and
reaching
to
touch
my
cheek
i
was
so
startled
i
took
the
bundle
that
was
sarah
child
but
then
i
thought
no
alex
goddard
will
just
kill
him
too
she
said
he
must
not
harm
you
marcelina
whispered
moving
beside
me
you
are
the
special
one
she
wants
you
to
give
her
child
back
to
kukulkan
she
still
believes
i
realized
they
all
do
holding
tzotz
my
eyes
fixed
on
alex
goddard
i
entirely
failed
to
notice
a
new
presence
on
the
pyramid
a
ghostlike
waif
in
a
white
shift
who
now
stood
silently
in
the
doorway
of
the
stone
room
sarah
marcelina
had
said
she
wanted
to
come
for
the
ceremony
she
was
being
helped
to
stand
by
the
two
maya
women
who
fed
me
the
somehow
she
gotten
them
to
bring
her
morgy
are
you
there
sarah
asked
gazing
up
at
the
rainy
skies
the
downpour
soaking
her
blond
hair
her
eyes
unblinking
at
that
moment
i
felt
we
joined
become
one
person
me
the
dogged
rational
half
just
gone
over
the
line
her
the
spiritual
part
that
needed
to
float
to
fly
free
i
wanted
to
be
with
sar
get
back
i
yelled
and
started
to
go
to
her
but
there
time
now
alex
goddard
was
moving
toward
me
holding
the
knife
as
though
tracking
a
prey
oblivious
to
sarah
to
everything
concentrated
all
his
hatred
on
me
and
me
alone
and
i
hated
him
back
as
much
death
hovered
between
us
waiting
to
see
whom
to
take
but
then
the
woman
who
had
borne
tzotz
said
something
in
kekchi
maya
pointing
back
at
me
and
her
child
and
lunged
at
him
they
collided
together
in
the
rain
and
next
she
slid
down
first
seizing
his
leg
then
losing
her
grip
and
slipping
onto
the
stones
her
long
black
hair
askew
in
the
hovering
smoke
she
trying
to
save
me
i
realized
why
then
i
saw
sarah
pull
away
from
the
women
supporting
her
and
slowly
move
across
the
platform
morgy
she
was
walking
in
the
direction
of
alex
goddard
but
then
she
stumbled
over
the
fallen
woman
leg
and
her
hand
went
down
as
she
sprawled
across
her
she
must
have
touched
something
because
she
recoiled
backward
and
only
then
did
i
notice
the
flare
of
a
torch
glinting
off
the
obsidian
knife
now
protruding
from
the
woman
chest
sarah
rose
up
her
eyes
full
of
anger
and
awkwardly
flung
her
arms
searching
i
could
feel
the
passion
that
had
been
pent
up
all
those
months
she
lay
in
the
coma
feeding
her
madness
she
managed
to
catch
hold
of
alex
goddard
arm
and
they
began
an
awkward
minuet
neither
realizing
how
close
they
were
to
the
stone
platform
edge
i
stood
mesmerized
a
moment
then
dashed
toward
them
but
only
in
time
to
watch
them
vanish
into
the
rain
and
haze
it
was
as
though
there
had
been
some
sleight
of
hand
one
second
they
were
there
and
the
next
they
were
at
first
i
thought
my
eyes
were
playing
tricks
on
me
but
then
i
realized
it
was
real
they
were
gone
i
reached
the
side
in
time
to
see
them
land
on
the
first
tier
of
stones
below
she
fallen
near
the
edge
but
she
was
solid
and
safe
alex
goddard
however
hit
with
one
foot
on
and
one
foot
off
and
the
result
was
he
slid
away
then
vanished
into
the
dark
rain
it
her
final
act
of
she
joined
me
in
my
rage
but
we
both
been
spared
that
the
miracle
of
sar
do
move
i
finally
found
my
voice
i
was
still
holding
tzotz
who
begun
to
shriek
his
blue
eyes
flooded
with
fear
now
several
village
men
from
the
square
were
running
shouting
up
the
slippery
steps
their
faces
looked
like
they
been
painted
at
one
time
but
now
the
rain
had
washed
most
of
it
away
while
i
yelled
down
to
sarah
again
begging
her
not
to
move
marcelina
was
asking
them
something
and
their
answers
were
tumbling
out
finally
i
turned
to
look
at
her
the
screaming
tzotz
still
in
my
arms
no
one
knows
where
he
is
she
was
saying
as
she
looked
down
over
the
side
he
gone
into
the
forest
good
i
pulled
tzotz
to
me
and
kissed
him
trying
to
tell
him
to
calm
down
it
was
working
marcelina
here
please
hold
him
i
got
to
get
down
to
sarah
she
took
him
then
i
walked
over
to
where
his
mother
lay
bleeding
on
the
stones
the
woman
was
moving
the
obsidian
knife
still
protruding
from
her
chest
she
saved
me
but
now
death
had
taken
her
there
was
nothing
anyone
could
do
i
was
trembling
but
i
turned
and
began
easing
myself
over
the
side
of
the
stone
platform
and
onto
the
first
tier
of
the
pyramid
sar
do
move
i
inched
my
way
across
to
her
just
stay
still
the
rain
was
pouring
again
but
the
electric
bloom
of
sparks
and
flames
from
the
direction
of
the
clinic
was
unabated
it
would
be
completely
gutted
was
steve
awake
enough
to
get
out
seemed
alert
when
i
left
him
morgy
is
that
you
she
was
holding
out
her
fingers
i
ca
see
you
where
are
i
here
sar
right
here
i
reached
down
and
took
her
hand
which
was
deathly
cold
come
on
let
me
help
you
get
up
carefully
leaning
against
the
wet
stones
of
the
side
of
the
pyramid
i
gradually
pulled
her
to
her
feet
and
away
from
the
treacherous
edge
then
it
hit
me
what
she
said
sar
what
do
you
mean
you
ca
see
me
i
okay
it
just
she
was
gripping
my
hand
now
and
then
she
brushed
against
the
stone
side
of
the
pyramid
and
put
out
her
other
hand
to
cling
to
it
morgy
i
took
it
again
to
go
to
their
sacred
place
but
sometimes
you
can
only
see
visions
and
then
after
a
while
everything
goes
blank
that
bastard
alex
goddard
had
given
her
the
drug
again
now
she
was
lost
in
a
world
of
colored
lights
a
place
i
just
traveled
through
myself
she
probably
had
no
idea
she
just
pushed
him
off
the
pyramid
and
into
the
dark
your
hand
feels
so
soft
she
was
saying
you
like
warm
honey
sar
try
to
walk
we
going
to
turn
a
corner
and
then
we
be
at
the
back
of
the
pyramid
next
we
come
to
some
steps
and
then
going
down
as
i
inched
our
way
along
scarcely
able
to
keep
our
footing
because
of
the
rain
i
wondered
again
about
steve
please
god
let
him
be
all
right
when
we
finally
got
to
the
steps
marcelina
was
there
standing
expectantly
holding
tzotz
he
was
still
crying
intermittent
sobs
he
belongs
to
you
now
she
said
holding
him
out
for
me
it
what
she
wished
what
i
took
him
before
i
realized
what
i
was
doing
as
i
cradled
him
gazing
down
at
his
tender
little
face
i
realized
he
truly
was
sarah
all
over
again
and
i
was
so
glad
she
could
see
him
never
i
thought
she
must
never
ever
know
i
finally
forced
myself
to
place
him
back
into
marcelina
arms
you
got
no
idea
how
much
i
want
him
but
i
ca
let
one
of
these
women
give
him
her
milk
have
a
twin
for
her
own
child
for
that
wrenching
moment
i
held
the
very
baby
my
heart
longed
for
but
he
was
the
last
one
on
earth
i
could
have
just
go
take
sarah
and
find
steve
and
go
as
far
from
as
you
can
before
you
lose
your
compass
and
do
something
terribly
selfish
marcelina
i
said
reaching
to
hug
her
tell
them
these
children
are
all
from
his
look
up
vitro
in
your
dictionary
that
all
it
is
she
hugged
me
back
though
i
was
sure
whether
she
understood
then
i
asked
her
to
take
sarah
hand
for
a
moment
while
i
went
back
up
the
steps
to
the
platform
i
felt
a
primal
anger
as
i
took
one
last
look
at
the
women
alex
goddard
had
wronged
now
clustered
around
the
body
of
tzotz
mother
then
i
bade
them
a
silent
farewell
turned
and
walked
holding
my
tears
back
through
the
stone
room
the
rear
of
the
pyramid
was
deserted
the
steps
slippery
and
dangerous
but
it
was
our
way
out
i
began
leading
sarah
down
step
by
treacherous
step
everything
had
happened
so
fast
i
barely
had
time
to
think
about
steve
those
flames
my
god
it
was
finally
sinking
in
truly
hitting
me
had
he
gotten
out
in
time
then
the
slimy
rio
tigre
now
swelling
from
the
rain
came
into
view
i
stared
at
it
a
second
before
i
noticed
the
three
young
army
recruits
leaning
against
the
trunk
of
a
giant
cebia
tree
next
to
the
trail
their
rifles
covered
in
plastic
against
the
rain
when
they
saw
us
they
stiffened
shifted
their
weapons
and
glanced
up
at
the
top
of
the
pyramid
as
though
seeking
orders
neither
group
had
any
idea
why
the
other
was
there
sarah
and
i
were
an
unforeseen
contingency
they
been
briefed
on
what
are
they
going
to
do
they
have
no
idea
what
just
happened
morgy
sarah
said
gazing
blankly
at
the
sky
the
colors
are
so
beautiful
can
we
shhh
we
talk
in
a
minute
i
smiled
and
nodded
and
began
walking
past
the
young
privates
holding
my
breath
then
a
spectral
form
emerged
out
of
the
rain
just
behind
them
it
took
me
a
moment
to
recognize
who
it
was
i
was
hoping
it
might
be
steve
but
instead
it
was
a
man
dressed
in
white
now
covered
with
mud
and
holding
a
knife
not
obsidian
this
time
but
long
and
steel
his
eyes
were
glazed
and
i
was
sure
if
he
even
knew
exactly
where
he
was
why
had
he
come
down
to
the
river
had
he
known
i
come
here
too
for
a
moment
we
just
stood
staring
at
each
other
while
the
army
privates
began
edging
up
the
hill
as
though
not
wanting
to
witness
what
surely
was
coming
next
why
do
you
put
an
end
to
all
the
evil
i
yelled
at
him
finally
trying
to
project
through
the
rain
just
stop
it
right
now
was
my
life
work
he
said
then
he
looked
down
at
the
knife
a
moment
as
though
unsure
what
it
was
finally
he
turned
and
flung
it
in
the
direction
of
the
river
it
could
have
been
beautiful
i
said
back
thank
god
the
knife
was
gone
but
what
would
he
do
next
but
now
no
he
said
staring
directly
at
me
his
eyes
seeming
to
plead
it
is
it
will
be
again
to
make
a
place
like
to
coin
the
riches
of
god
i
want
you
to
stay
to
be
part
of
it
together
we
but
whatever
else
he
said
was
lost
in
the
cloudburst
that
abruptly
swept
over
the
embankment
in
an
instant
it
was
a
torrent
the
last
outpouring
of
the
storm
powerful
and
unrelenting
nature
had
unleashed
its
worst
as
though
kukulkan
was
rendering
his
final
judgment
morgy
i
falling
sarah
screamed
the
ground
she
and
i
had
been
standing
on
began
turning
to
liquid
as
though
it
were
a
custard
melting
in
the
tropical
heat
as
we
began
slipping
down
the
embankment
toward
him
i
gripped
her
arm
with
my
left
hand
and
reached
up
to
seize
a
branch
of
the
cebia
with
my
right
then
under
the
weight
of
the
water
all
the
soil
beneath
us
gave
way
tons
of
wet
riverbank
that
abruptly
buckled
outward
alex
goddard
made
no
sound
as
the
mass
of
earth
lifted
him
backward
toward
the
river
his
sullied
garb
of
white
blended
into
the
gray
sludge
of
mud
and
rain
then
faded
to
darkness
as
the
embankment
dissolved
into
the
swirling
rio
tigre
sar
hold
on
please
hold
on
i
felt
my
grasp
of
the
tree
slipping
but
now
the
mud
slide
had
begun
to
stabilize
i
managed
to
cling
to
the
limb
for
a
few
seconds
more
the
bark
cutting
into
my
fingers
and
then
my
hold
slipped
away
sending
us
both
spiraling
downward
till
we
were
temporarily
snagged
by
the
newly
exposed
undergrowth
i
still
had
her
hand
though
just
barely
but
the
torrent
of
rain
and
mud
was
subsiding
and
finally
we
collapsed
together
into
the
gnarled
network
of
roots
after
a
moment
rest
i
managed
to
crawl
out
and
pull
her
up
come
on
sar
try
and
walk
together
we
stumbled
and
slid
down
the
last
incline
before
the
edge
then
turned
upstream
along
the
bank
after
about
fifty
yards
sure
enough
the
native
the
mahogany
canoes
told
steve
about
were
still
there
just
as
i
seen
them
that
first
morning
bobbing
and
straining
at
their
moorings
in
the
rain
i
could
tell
how
usable
they
were
but
i
figured
going
downriver
was
the
only
way
we
ever
be
able
to
get
out
we
have
to
flee
the
way
sarah
had
that
first
time
for
a
moment
i
thought
they
all
were
empty
dear
god
no
but
then
i
realized
there
was
a
drenched
figure
in
the
last
one
in
the
row
when
i
recognized
who
it
was
i
think
i
completely
lost
it
all
the
horror
of
the
last
two
days
swallowed
me
up
i
grabbed
sarah
and
hugged
her
for
dear
life
feeling
the
tears
coursing
down
my
cheeks
i
literally
could
help
myself
they
were
tied
up
here
just
like
you
said
steve
wiped
the
rain
from
his
eyes
then
reached
to
take
my
hand
his
bandaged
nose
was
bleeding
again
and
he
looked
like
he
just
been
half
killed
i
told
those
little
army
i
was
a
big
amigo
of
doctor
they
saluted
and
showed
me
where
these
were
tied
up
thank
god
you
okay
what
happened
did
ramos
the
son
of
a
bitch
he
came
in
and
i
guess
it
was
time
to
finish
me
off
but
i
was
as
drugged
out
as
he
thought
he
was
staring
at
sarah
clearly
relieved
but
asking
no
questions
i
brought
along
his
he
indicated
the
silver
automatic
in
his
belt
in
case
we
run
into
problems
i
wanted
to
kiss
him
but
i
was
still
too
shaken
up
instead
i
focused
on
helping
sarah
in
without
capsizing
everything
after
i
settled
her
i
pulled
myself
over
the
side
and
reached
for
a
paddle
if
we
go
with
the
current
i
said
we
get
to
the
usumacinta
hopefully
the
flooding
will
help
push
us
downstream
honestly
i
did
think
the
fire
would
get
away
from
me
like
it
did
he
shoved
off
amidst
the
swirling
debris
jesus
i
heard
them
taking
you
away
and
i
assumed
you
did
get
to
mess
up
his
lab
so
i
figured
there
was
one
way
i
just
threw
around
some
ether
and
pitched
a
match
the
place
was
empty
so
i
looked
around
at
the
roiling
waters
snakes
and
crocodiles
lurking
and
felt
a
lifetime
of
determination
was
alex
goddard
still
alive
i
no
longer
cared
sunrise
was
breaking
through
the
last
of
the
rain
laying
dancing
shadows
on
the
water
as
we
rowed
for
midstream
someday
i
knew
what
was
real
about
what
i
dreamed
here
might
well
merge
together
the
way
they
had
for
sarah
but
for
now
true
daylight
never
looked
better
chapter
we
got
picked
up
by
a
ragged
crew
of
mexican
fishermen
just
before
dark
aside
from
being
sunburned
to
medium
rare
we
were
physically
okay
the
fresh
air
and
sunshine
did
a
lot
to
bring
sarah
back
though
she
did
have
lapses
of
and
once
tried
to
dive
over
the
side
of
their
fishing
cutter
they
dropped
us
off
at
the
tourist
site
of
yaxchitan
a
mayan
ruin
on
the
western
bank
of
the
mighty
usumacinta
where
we
joined
an
american
on
its
way
back
to
san
cristobal
de
las
casas
there
we
caught
a
prop
flight
to
cancun
and
then
american
airlines
to
new
york
we
had
no
luggage
but
i
flew
us
and
i
still
have
the
mastercard
slip
to
prove
it
as
things
turned
out
though
returning
sarah
to
normalcy
or
me
for
that
matter
was
another
struggle
entirely
for
me
time
after
that
rainy
morning
in
the
peten
became
an
essence
that
flowed
around
me
as
though
i
were
aswim
in
the
ether
of
interstellar
space
pondering
the
conjunction
of
good
and
evil
i
suffered
flashbacks
reveries
of
forests
and
children
that
must
have
been
like
those
sarah
struggled
to
bury
for
weeks
after
that
i
had
a
lot
of
trouble
remembering
meetings
returning
phone
calls
giving
david
an
honest
day
editing
for
her
own
part
sarah
just
seemed
to
drift
at
first
to
the
point
i
sometimes
wondered
if
she
realized
she
was
back
at
lou
loft
then
abruptly
one
day
she
snapped
into
her
old
self
and
started
sending
for
materials
from
columbia
i
really
needed
to
talk
with
her
about
our
mutual
nightmare
but
she
seemed
to
have
erased
all
memories
of
except
for
occasional
mumbles
in
kekchi
maya
perhaps
that
was
best
i
consoled
myself
maybe
it
was
wise
for
us
all
just
to
let
the
ghosts
of
that
faraway
place
lie
sleeping
as
for
lou
i
told
him
as
little
as
i
could
about
what
happened
to
her
there
he
had
returned
to
work
had
mainly
stayed
at
his
soho
place
to
be
near
her
as
though
he
was
fearful
she
might
be
snatched
away
from
him
once
more
frankly
i
think
all
his
enforced
closeness
was
starting
to
grate
on
her
nerves
though
i
dared
not
hint
such
a
thing
to
him
in
the
meantime
steve
returned
to
belize
to
wrap
up
his
photo
essay
and
david
submitted
a
very
rough
cut
of
love
the
selection
committee
at
sundance
our
distribution
deal
with
orion
was
alas
in
temporary
turnaround
pending
yet
another
management
shuffle
we
did
however
squeeze
an
advance
from
lifetime
that
lowered
the
heat
with
nicky
russo
nevertheless
the
story
of
how
alex
goddard
touched
all
our
lives
still
was
over
it
was
two
months
after
we
got
back
to
the
city
that
my
dark
dance
with
the
man
who
thought
he
was
shiva
creator
and
destroyer
had
its
final
pirouette
as
though
his
ghost
had
returned
from
his
redoubt
for
one
last
sorcerer
turn
truthfully
it
all
transpired
so
fast
i
could
scarcely
take
it
in
but
here
the
rough
outline
of
what
happened
i
was
working
late
that
thursday
evening
in
the
editing
room
at
applecore
around
seven
and
i
was
feeling
particularly
out
of
sorts
including
a
headache
and
stomach
pains
from
the
leftover
pizza
i
microwaved
to
keep
me
going
i
was
some
new
interviews
filmed
to
replace
those
of
carly
and
paula
children
of
light
had
gone
defunct
by
the
way
the
phone
at
quetzal
manor
disconnected
but
i
did
need
any
more
excitement
in
my
life
of
the
colonel
ramos
variety
the
replacement
interviews
were
nearly
as
bubbly
and
full
of
exuberance
but
they
were
actually
much
truer
to
the
realities
of
adoption
anyway
i
listened
to
my
stomach
and
decided
it
was
high
time
to
toss
in
the
towel
i
got
my
things
locked
up
and
then
i
ran
into
david
on
the
elevator
coming
down
from
the
floor
above
how
it
going
he
asked
ostentatiously
checking
his
watch
an
approving
gleam
in
his
eyes
i
was
glad
he
wanted
to
let
me
know
noticed
i
was
logging
long
hours
then
he
looked
at
me
again
hey
you
feeling
okay
i
been
better
i
said
thinking
how
nice
it
was
that
he
cared
could
be
a
couple
of
aspirin
and
a
good
night
sleep
are
called
for
so
now
you
a
doctor
he
said
following
me
into
the
lobby
providing
david
give
me
a
break
i
just
happen
to
feel
a
little
off
today
okay
it
does
mean
i
at
death
door
yeah
well
the
way
you
look
you
coulda
fooled
me
he
headed
down
the
street
toward
the
avenue
then
he
called
back
over
his
shoulder
i
do
want
to
see
you
in
tomorrow
unless
you
look
like
you
might
live
through
the
day
i
pay
for
your
health
insurance
use
it
for
sake
after
i
found
a
cab
i
began
to
think
he
might
be
right
this
was
no
typical
down
day
so
i
decided
i
stop
at
the
duane
reade
on
my
corner
and
talk
to
the
pharmacist
the
man
was
on
a
portly
old
guy
who
knew
more
about
drugs
than
most
doctors
the
tag
on
his
jacket
said
bernd
and
that
all
anybody
ever
knew
of
his
name
i
sometimes
called
him
bernd
by
way
of
banter
but
nothing
i
could
do
would
ever
make
him
smile
the
place
was
nearly
empty
and
the
pharmacy
at
the
rear
with
its
spectral
fluorescent
lighting
looked
like
an
from
a
wes
craven
movie
bernd
who
was
in
back
puttering
came
out
and
looked
me
over
i
know
it
sounds
naive
but
i
trusted
him
more
than
i
trust
half
the
young
overworked
interns
you
get
at
an
emergency
room
these
days
i
poured
out
my
symptoms
including
the
story
about
how
i
been
given
fertility
drugs
and
toad
venom
was
it
all
coming
back
to
haunt
me
the
dark
hand
of
alex
goddard
he
began
by
asking
me
some
very
perceptive
questions
about
things
that
had
been
puzzling
me
but
i
sort
of
managed
to
dismiss
finally
he
walked
around
the
counter
and
lifted
a
small
box
off
a
rack
try
this
he
said
handing
it
over
and
then
come
back
tomorrow
maybe
it
not
such
a
big
deal
you
kidding
i
thought
looking
at
the
box
i
got
home
collapsed
onto
the
couch
and
opened
it
believe
it
or
not
i
actually
had
to
read
the
instructions
i
did
what
they
said
checked
the
time
and
then
decided
to
run
a
hot
bath
i
filled
the
tub
dumped
in
some
put
the
cordless
on
the
toilet
seat
and
splashed
in
it
felt
so
good
i
wanted
to
dissolve
then
i
reached
for
the
phone
the
clock
above
the
sink
read
and
i
figured
rightly
that
steve
would
be
back
at
his
hotel
in
belize
city
sure
enough
i
got
him
on
the
first
try
honey
you
sitting
down
i
said
i
lying
down
you
would
believe
my
day
you
not
going
to
believe
what
i
just
heard
from
the
pharmacist
at
the
corner
remember
i
told
you
i
been
feeling
strange
and
some
things
were
a
little
behind
schedule
well
guess
what
we
about
to
find
out
something
we
ca
be
together
but
we
can
share
it
over
a
satellite
you
mean
i
doing
the
test
right
now
you
know
you
take
the
stick
out
of
the
glass
holder
and
if
it
turned
pink
he
was
speechless
for
a
long
moment
finally
he
just
said
wow
i
checked
the
clock
again
then
reached
for
the
test
tube
this
i
realized
is
the
most
incredible
moment
in
any
woman
life
is
your
world
going
to
go
on
being
the
same
or
is
it
never
ever
going
to
be
the
same
again
when
i
pulled
out
the
stick
it
was
a
bright
beautiful
pink
steve
i
love
you
it
max
he
did
realize
it
but
his
voice
had
just
gone
up
an
octave
what
that
my
dad
middle
name
i
want
to
name
him
max
it
an
old
family
tradition
and
what
if
it
a
girl
do
say
maxine
or
i
divorce
you
before
you
even
make
an
honest
woman
of
me
nope
if
it
a
girl
then
you
get
to
pick
i
could
believe
i
was
finally
having
this
conversation
it
was
something
i
dreamed
of
for
years
it
then
got
too
maudlin
to
repeat
he
was
coming
home
in
eleven
days
and
we
planned
the
celebration
dinner
at
le
cirque
and
then
an
evening
at
cafe
carlyle
for
a
couple
of
new
york
sophisticates
that
was
about
as
as
this
town
gets
i
was
crying
tears
of
triumph
by
the
time
we
hung
up
by
then
it
was
late
enough
i
figured
arlene
would
be
home
from
her
exercise
class
so
i
decided
to
call
her
and
break
the
happy
news
once
more
who
i
really
wanted
to
call
was
betsy
on
the
coast
but
i
knew
she
still
be
driving
home
from
her
temp
job
arlene
would
have
to
do
telling
her
would
be
the
equivalent
of
sending
an
urgent
to
the
entire
office
but
i
wanted
everybody
to
know
two
birds
with
one
stone
i
looked
down
at
my
body
all
the
curves
and
soft
skin
and
tried
to
think
about
the
miracle
of
a
baby
finally
growing
inside
it
life
recreating
itself
god
arlene
was
going
to
break
my
mood
but
for
some
reason
i
had
to
call
her
if
only
to
bring
me
back
to
reality
i
reached
over
and
clicked
open
the
cordless
again
i
was
punching
in
her
number
when
something
made
me
pause
it
was
a
nagging
thought
that
i
managed
to
repress
for
a
while
finally
though
it
would
stay
down
any
more
there
was
something
i
had
to
check
out
i
slowly
put
down
the
handset
climbed
out
of
the
tub
dried
off
then
plodded
into
the
bedroom
to
dig
out
my
private
calendar
which
had
long
since
become
a
record
of
everything
relevant
to
my
and
steve
baby
project
it
was
buried
at
the
bottom
of
the
desk
second
drawer
in
amongst
old
bank
statements
it
was
also
figuratively
covered
by
two
months
of
dust
since
that
was
how
long
it
been
since
i
bothered
with
it
i
guess
my
attitude
had
been
what
the
point
i
placed
it
on
the
desk
trying
not
to
get
it
wet
then
i
wrapped
the
towel
more
firmly
around
me
switched
on
the
desk
lamp
and
sat
down
i
think
i
was
also
holding
my
breath
i
counted
all
the
days
twice
but
there
was
no
mistaking
the
night
steve
and
i
had
spent
so
gloriously
together
in
the
camino
real
a
fertile
time
not
even
close
i
suppose
that
by
then
i
become
so
despairing
of
ever
getting
pregnant
i
had
even
given
it
any
thought
it
was
enough
just
to
see
him
and
hold
him
i
just
sat
there
for
a
long
time
staring
at
the
white
page
unable
to
move
random
thoughts
coming
too
fast
to
contain
inside
my
tangled
brain
finally
though
i
managed
to
get
up
and
numbly
put
the
calendar
away
order
i
needed
order
i
then
worked
my
way
into
the
kitchen
to
fix
myself
something
i
had
a
glass
of
water
then
pulled
down
a
bottle
of
red
label
and
poured
myself
half
a
tumbler
okay
somewhere
down
deep
i
knew
it
was
the
worst
possible
thing
i
could
do
but
i
was
thinking
just
going
on
autopilot
and
dismay
i
drank
off
a
shot
of
the
scotch
then
realized
how
thoughtless
that
was
and
dumped
the
rest
into
the
sink
next
i
moved
into
the
living
room
and
put
on
a
raga
malkauns
concert
volume
the
one
where
the
first
note
goes
straight
to
your
heart
finally
i
collapsed
onto
the
couch
the
room
now
gloriously
alive
with
all
the
spirituality
and
sensuality
of
the
raga
notes
piling
on
exquisite
notes
for
a
while
i
just
lay
there
numbly
enveloped
in
its
lush
eroticism
eventually
i
started
to
think
alex
goddard
had
planned
to
take
from
me
but
had
he
also
given
had
his
proprietary
ovulation
drugs
causing
all
those
hundreds
of
eggs
to
mature
simultaneously
inadvertently
let
me
get
pregnant
then
i
had
a
dismaying
could
he
have
done
an
while
i
was
under
sedation
when
he
harvested
my
ova
the
ultimate
link
to
was
my
baby
sarah
too
one
of
those
last
frozen
embryos
in
his
then
i
leaned
back
and
closed
my
eyes
no
surely
not
this
baby
was
steve
and
mine
ours
had
to
be
his
unintended
beautiful
ironic
gift
surely
go
for
a
second
take
embrace
life
be
molly
bloom
and
shout
it
yes
