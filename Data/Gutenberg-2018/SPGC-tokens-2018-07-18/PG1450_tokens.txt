miss

miss
polly
harrington
entered
her
kitchen
a
little
hurriedly
this
june
morning
miss
polly
did
not
usually
make
hurried
movements
she
specially
prided
herself
on
her
repose
of
manner
but
she
was
hurrying
actually
hurrying
nancy
washing
dishes
at
the
sink
looked
up
in
surprise
nancy
had
been
working
in
miss
polly
kitchen
only
two
months
but
already
she
knew
that
her
mistress
did
not
usually
hurry
nancy
yes
nancy
answered
cheerfully
but
she
still
continued
wiping
the
pitcher
in
her
hand
nancy
miss
polly
voice
was
very
stern
now
when
i
talking
to
you
i
wish
you
to
stop
your
work
and
listen
to
what
i
have
to
nancy
flushed
miserably
she
set
the
pitcher
down
at
once
with
the
cloth
still
about
it
thereby
nearly
tipping
it
over
which
did
not
add
to
her
composure
yes
i
will
she
stammered
righting
the
pitcher
and
turning
hastily
i
was
only
keepin
on
with
my
work
you
specially
told
me
this
mornin
ter
hurry
with
my
dishes
ye
her
mistress
frowned
that
will
do
nancy
i
did
not
ask
for
explanations
i
asked
for
your
yes
nancy
stifled
a
sigh
she
was
wondering
if
ever
in
any
way
she
could
please
this
woman
nancy
had
never
worked
out
before
but
a
sick
mother
suddenly
widowed
and
left
with
three
younger
children
besides
nancy
herself
had
forced
the
girl
into
doing
something
toward
their
support
and
she
had
been
so
pleased
when
she
found
a
place
in
the
kitchen
of
the
great
house
on
the
hill
nancy
had
come
from
the
corners
six
miles
away
and
she
knew
miss
polly
harrington
only
as
the
mistress
of
the
old
harrington
homestead
and
one
of
the
wealthiest
residents
of
the
town
that
was
two
months
before
she
knew
miss
polly
now
as
a
stern
woman
who
frowned
if
a
knife
clattered
to
the
floor
or
if
a
door
banged
but
who
never
thought
to
smile
even
when
knives
and
doors
were
still
when
you
finished
your
morning
work
nancy
miss
polly
was
saying
now
you
may
clear
the
little
room
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
in
the
attic
and
make
up
the
cot
bed
sweep
the
room
and
clean
it
of
course
after
you
clear
out
the
trunks
and
yes
and
where
shall
i
put
the
things
please
that
i
take
out
in
the
front
miss
polly
hesitated
then
went
on
i
suppose
i
may
as
well
tell
you
now
nancy
my
niece
miss
pollyanna
whittier
is
coming
to
live
with
me
she
is
eleven
years
old
and
will
sleep
in
that
a
little
girl
coming
here
miss
harrington
oh
wo
that
be
nice
cried
nancy
thinking
of
the
sunshine
her
own
little
sisters
made
in
the
home
at
the
nice
well
that
is
exactly
the
word
i
should
use
rejoined
miss
polly
stiffly
however
i
intend
to
make
the
best
of
it
of
course
i
am
a
good
woman
i
hope
and
i
know
my
nancy
colored
hotly
of
course
it
was
only
that
i
thought
a
little
girl
here
might
might
brighten
things
up
for
you
she
faltered
thank
you
rejoined
the
lady
dryly
i
ca
say
however
that
i
see
any
immediate
need
for
but
of
course
you
you
want
her
your
sister
child
ventured
nancy
vaguely
feeling
that
somehow
she
must
prepare
a
welcome
for
this
lonely
little
stranger
miss
polly
lifted
her
chin
haughtily
well
really
nancy
just
because
i
happened
to
have
a
sister
who
was
silly
enough
to
marry
and
bring
unnecessary
children
into
a
world
that
was
already
quite
full
enough
i
ca
see
how
i
should
particularly
want
to
have
the
care
of
them
myself
however
as
i
said
before
i
hope
i
know
my
duty
see
that
you
clean
the
corners
nancy
she
finished
sharply
as
she
left
the
room
yes
sighed
nancy
picking
up
the
pitcher
now
so
cold
it
must
be
rinsed
again
in
her
own
room
miss
polly
took
out
once
more
the
letter
which
she
had
received
two
days
before
from
the
western
town
and
which
had
been
so
unpleasant
a
surprise
to
her
the
letter
was
addressed
to
miss
polly
harrington
beldingsville
vermont
and
it
read
as
follows
dear
madam
i
regret
to
inform
you
that
the
rev
john
whittier
died
two
weeks
ago
leaving
one
child
a
girl
eleven
years
old
he
left
practically
nothing
else
save
a
few
books
for
as
you
doubtless
know
he
was
the
pastor
of
this
small
mission
church
and
had
a
very
meagre
salary
i
believe
he
was
your
deceased
sister
husband
but
he
gave
me
to
understand
the
families
were
not
on
the
best
of
terms
he
thought
however
that
for
your
sister
sake
you
might
wish
to
take
the
child
and
bring
her
up
among
her
own
people
in
the
east
hence
i
am
writing
to
you
the
little
girl
will
be
all
ready
to
start
by
the
time
you
get
this
letter
and
if
you
can
take
her
we
would
appreciate
it
very
much
if
you
would
write
that
she
might
come
at
once
as
there
is
a
man
and
his
wife
here
who
are
going
east
very
soon
and
they
would
take
her
with
them
to
boston
and
put
her
on
the
beldingsville
train
of
course
you
would
be
notified
what
day
and
train
to
expect
pollyanna
on
hoping
to
hear
favorably
from
you
soon
i
remain
respectfully
yours
jeremiah
with
a
frown
miss
polly
folded
the
letter
and
tucked
it
into
its
envelope
she
had
answered
it
the
day
before
and
she
had
said
she
would
take
the
child
of
course
she
hoped
she
knew
her
duty
well
enough
for
that
disagreeable
as
the
task
would
be
as
she
sat
now
with
the
letter
in
her
hands
her
thoughts
went
back
to
her
sister
jennie
who
had
been
this
child
mother
and
to
the
time
when
jennie
as
a
girl
of
twenty
had
insisted
upon
marrying
the
young
minister
in
spite
of
her
family
remonstrances
there
had
been
a
man
of
wealth
who
had
wanted
her
and
the
family
had
much
preferred
him
to
the
minister
but
jennie
had
not
the
man
of
wealth
had
more
years
as
well
as
more
money
to
his
credit
while
the
minister
had
only
a
young
head
full
of
youth
ideals
and
enthusiasm
and
a
heart
full
of
love
jennie
had
preferred
these
quite
naturally
perhaps
so
she
had
married
the
minister
and
had
gone
south
with
him
as
a
home
missionary
wife
the
break
had
come
then
miss
polly
remembered
it
well
though
she
had
been
but
a
girl
of
fifteen
the
youngest
at
the
time
the
family
had
had
little
more
to
do
with
the
missionary
wife
to
be
sure
jennie
herself
had
written
for
a
time
and
had
named
her
last
baby
pollyanna
for
her
two
sisters
polly
and
anna
the
other
babies
had
all
died
this
had
been
the
last
time
that
jennie
had
written
and
in
a
few
years
there
had
come
the
news
of
her
death
told
in
a
short
but
little
note
from
the
minister
himself
dated
at
a
little
town
in
the
west
meanwhile
time
had
not
stood
still
for
the
occupants
of
the
great
house
on
the
hill
miss
polly
looking
out
at
the
valley
below
thought
of
the
changes
those
years
had
brought
to
her
she
was
forty
now
and
quite
alone
in
the
world
father
mother
sisters
all
were
dead
for
years
now
she
had
been
sole
mistress
of
the
house
and
of
the
thousands
left
her
by
her
father
there
were
people
who
had
openly
pitied
her
lonely
life
and
who
had
urged
her
to
have
some
friend
or
companion
to
live
with
her
but
she
had
not
welcomed
either
their
sympathy
or
their
advice
she
was
not
lonely
she
said
she
liked
being
by
herself
she
preferred
quiet
but
now
miss
polly
rose
with
frowning
face
and
lips
she
was
glad
of
course
that
she
was
a
good
woman
and
that
she
not
only
knew
her
duty
but
had
sufficient
strength
of
character
to
perform
it
but
pollyanna
what
a
ridiculous
name
chapter
ii
old
tom
and
nancy
in
the
little
attic
room
nancy
swept
and
scrubbed
vigorously
paying
particular
attention
to
the
corners
there
were
times
indeed
when
the
vigor
she
put
into
her
work
was
more
of
a
relief
to
her
feelings
than
it
was
an
ardor
to
efface
dirt
nancy
in
spite
of
her
frightened
submission
to
her
mistress
was
no
saint
i
just
wish
i
could
dig
out
the
corners
of
her
soul
she
muttered
jerkily
punctuating
her
words
with
murderous
jabs
of
her
pointed
there
plenty
of
needs
cleanin
all
right
all
right
the
idea
of
stickin
that
blessed
child
off
up
here
in
this
hot
little
room
with
no
fire
in
the
winter
too
and
all
this
big
house
ter
pick
and
choose
from
unnecessary
children
indeed
humph
snapped
nancy
wringing
her
rag
so
hard
her
fingers
ached
from
the
strain
i
guess
it
ai
children
what
is
most
unnecessary
just
now
just
now
for
some
time
she
worked
in
silence
then
her
task
finished
she
looked
about
the
bare
little
room
in
plain
disgust
well
it
done
my
part
anyhow
she
sighed
there
ai
no
dirt
here
and
there
mighty
little
else
poor
little
soul
a
pretty
place
this
is
ter
put
a
homesick
lonesome
child
into
she
finished
going
out
and
closing
the
door
with
a
bang
oh
she
ejaculated
biting
her
lip
then
doggedly
well
i
do
care
i
hope
she
did
hear
the
bang
i
do
i
do
in
the
garden
that
afternoon
nancy
found
a
few
minutes
in
which
to
interview
old
tom
who
had
pulled
the
weeds
and
shovelled
the
paths
about
the
place
for
uncounted
years
mr
tom
began
nancy
throwing
a
quick
glance
over
her
shoulder
to
make
sure
she
was
unobserved
did
you
know
a
little
girl
was
here
ter
live
with
miss
polly
a
what
demanded
the
old
man
straightening
his
bent
back
with
difficulty
a
little
girl
to
live
with
miss
go
on
with
yer
jokin
scoffed
unbelieving
tom
why
do
ye
tell
me
the
sun
is
ter
set
in
the
east
but
it
true
she
told
me
so
herself
maintained
nancy
it
her
niece
and
she
eleven
years
the
man
jaw
fell
sho
i
wonder
now
he
muttered
then
a
tender
light
came
into
his
faded
eyes
it
ai
but
it
must
be
miss
jennie
little
gal
there
was
none
of
the
rest
of
married
why
nancy
it
must
be
miss
jennie
little
gal
glory
be
ter
praise
ter
think
of
my
old
eyes
this
who
was
miss
jennie
she
was
an
angel
straight
out
of
heaven
breathed
the
man
fervently
but
the
old
master
and
missus
knew
her
as
their
oldest
daughter
she
was
twenty
when
she
married
and
went
away
from
here
long
years
ago
her
babies
all
died
i
heard
except
the
last
one
and
that
must
be
the
one
what
she
eleven
years
yes
she
might
be
nodded
the
old
man
and
she
goin
ter
sleep
in
the
attic
more
shame
ter
her
scolded
nancy
with
another
glance
over
her
shoulder
toward
the
house
behind
her
old
tom
frowned
the
next
moment
a
curious
smile
curved
his
lips
i
what
miss
polly
will
do
with
a
child
in
the
house
he
said
humph
well
i
what
a
child
will
do
with
miss
polly
in
the
house
snapped
nancy
the
old
man
laughed
i
afraid
you
ai
fond
of
miss
polly
he
grinned
as
if
ever
anybody
could
be
fond
of
her
scorned
nancy
old
tom
smiled
oddly
he
stooped
and
began
to
work
again
i
guess
maybe
you
did
know
about
miss
polly
love
affair
he
said
slowly
love
affair
her
no
and
i
guess
nobody
else
did
oh
yes
they
did
nodded
the
old
man
and
the
feller
right
in
this
town
who
is
he
i
ai
that
it
ai
fit
that
i
the
old
man
drew
himself
erect
in
his
dim
blue
eyes
as
he
faced
the
house
there
was
the
loyal
servant
honest
pride
in
the
family
he
has
served
and
loved
for
long
years
but
it
do
seem
possible
her
and
a
lover
still
maintained
nancy
old
tom
shook
his
head
you
did
know
miss
polly
as
i
did
he
argued
she
used
ter
be
real
handsome
and
she
would
be
now
if
she
let
herself
handsome
miss
polly
yes
if
she
just
let
that
tight
hair
of
hern
all
out
loose
and
as
it
used
ter
be
and
wear
the
sort
of
bunnits
with
posies
in
and
the
kind
o
dresses
all
lace
and
white
things
see
she
be
handsome
miss
polly
ai
old
ai
she
though
well
then
she
got
an
awfully
good
imitation
of
it
she
has
she
has
sniffed
nancy
yes
i
know
it
begun
then
at
the
time
of
the
trouble
with
her
lover
nodded
old
tom
and
it
seems
as
if
she
been
feedin
on
wormwood
thistles
ever
since
she
that
bitter
an
prickly
ter
deal
i
should
say
she
was
declared
nancy
indignantly
there
no
pleasin
her
nohow
no
matter
how
you
try
i
would
stay
if
for
the
wages
and
the
folks
at
home
what

but
some
day
some
day
i
shall
jest
over
and
when
i
do
of
course

be
nancy
for
me
it
will
it
old
tom
shook
his
head
i
know
i
felt
it
it
but
best
child
best
take
my
word
for
it
and
again
he
bent
his
old
head
to
the
work
before
him
nancy
called
a
sharp
voice
stammered
nancy
and
hurried
toward
the
house
chapter

the
coming
of

due
time
came
the
telegram
announcing
that
pollyanna
would
arrive
in
beldingsville
the
next
day
the
of
june
at
four
miss
polly
read
the
telegram
frowned
then
climbed
the
stairs
to
the
attic
room
she
still
frowned
as
she
looked
about
her
the
room
contained
a
small
bed
neatly
made
two
chairs
a
washstand
a
bureau
without
any
mirror
and
a
small
table
there
were
no
drapery
curtains
at
the
dormer
windows
no
pictures
on
the
wall
all
day
the
sun
had
been
pouring
down
upon
the
roof
and
the
little
room
was
like
an
oven
for
heat
as
there
were
no
screens
the
windows
had
not
been
raised
a
big
fly
was
buzzing
angrily
at
one
of
them
now
up
and
down
up
and
down
trying
to
get
out
miss
polly
killed
the
fly
swept
it
through
the
window
raising
the
sash
an
inch
for
the
purpose
straightened
a
chair
frowned
again
and
left
the
room
nancy
she
said
a
few
minutes
later
at
the
kitchen
door
i
found
a
fly
in
miss
pollyanna
room

window

have
been
raised

some
time

take
the
open
buggy
and
drive
you
over
the
telegram
says
hair
gingham
dress
and
straw
hat
that
is
all
i
know
but
i
think
it
is
sufficient
for
your
yes
but
you
miss
polly
evidently
read
the
pause
aright
for
she
frowned
and
said
crisply
no
i
shall
not
go
it
is
not
necessary
that
i
should
i
think
that
is
and
she
turned
away
miss
polly
arrangements
for
the
comfort
of
her
niece
pollyanna
were
complete
in
the
kitchen
nancy
sent
her
flatiron
with
a
vicious
dig
across
the
she
was
ironing
hair
gingham
dress
and
straw
hat
all
she
knows
indeed
well
i
be
ashamed
ter
own
it
up
that
i
would
i
would
and
her
my
onliest
niece
what
was
from
across
the
continent
promptly
at
twenty
minutes
to
four
the
next
afternoon
timothy
and
nancy
drove
off
in
the
open
buggy
to
meet
the
expected
guest
timothy
was
old
tom
son
it
was
sometimes
said
in
the
town
that
if
old
tom
was
miss
polly
man
timothy
was
her
left
timothy
was
a
youth
and
a
one
as
well
short
as
had
been
nancy
stay
at
the
house
the
two
were
already
good
friends
however
nancy
was
too
full
of
her
mission
to
be
her
usual
talkative
self
and
almost
in
silence
she
took
the
drive
to
the
station
and
alighted
to
wait
for
the
train
over
and
over
in
her
mind
she
was
saying
it
light
hair
dress
straw
over
and
over
again
she
was
wondering
just
what
sort
of
child
this
pollyanna
was
anyway
i
hope
for
her
sake
she
quiet
and
sensible
and
do
drop
knives
nor
bang
doors
she
sighed
to
timothy
who
had
sauntered
up
to
her
well
if
she
ai
nobody
knows
what
become
of
the
rest
of
us
grinned
timothy
imagine
miss
polly
and
a
noisy
kid
gorry
there
goes
the
whistle
now
oh
timothy
i
i
think
it
was
mean
ter
send
me
chattered
the
suddenly
frightened
nancy
as
she
turned
and
hurried
to
a
point
where
she
could
best
watch
the
passengers
alight
at
the
little
station
it
was
not
long
before
nancy
saw
her
the
slender
little
girl
in
the
gingham
with
two
fat
braids
of
flaxen
hair
hanging
down
her
back
beneath
the
straw
hat
an
eager
freckled
little
face
turned
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
plainly
searching
for
some
one
nancy
knew
the
child
at
once
but
not
for
some
time
could
she
control
her
shaking
knees
sufficiently
to
go
to
her
the
little
girl
was
standing
quite
by
herself
when
nancy
finally
did
approach
her
are
you
miss
pollyanna
she
faltered
the
next
moment
she
found
herself
half
smothered
in
the
clasp
of
two
arms
oh
i
so
glad
glad
glad
to
see
you
cried
an
eager
voice
in
her
ear
of
course
i
pollyanna
and
i
so
glad
you
came
to
meet
me
i
hoped
you
you
you
did
stammered
nancy
vaguely
wondering
how
pollyanna
could
possibly
have
known
her
and
wanted
her
you
you
did
she
repeated
trying
to
straighten
her
hat
oh
yes
and
i
been
wondering
all
the
way
here
what
you
looked
like
cried
the
little
girl
dancing
on
her
toes
and
sweeping
the
embarrassed
nancy
from
head
to
foot
with
her
eyes
and
now
i
know
and
i
glad
you
look
just
like
you
do
nancy
was
relieved
just
then
to
have
timothy
come
up
pollyanna
words
had
been
most
confusing
this
is
timothy
maybe
you
have
a
trunk
she
stammered
yes
i
have
nodded
pollyanna
importantly
i
got
a
one
the
ladies
aid
bought
it
for
me
and
was
it
lovely
of
them
when
they
wanted
the
carpet
so
of
course
i
do
know
how
much
red
carpet
a
trunk
could
buy
but
it
ought
to
buy
some
anyhow
much
as
half
an
aisle
do
you
think
i
got
a
little
thing
here
in
my
bag
that
gray
said
was
a
check
and
that
i
must
give
it
to
you
before
i
could
get
my
trunk
gray
is
gray
husband
they
cousins
of
deacon
carr
wife
i
came
east
with
them
and
they
lovely
and
there
here
she
finished
producing
the
check
after
much
fumbling
in
the
bag
she
carried
nancy
drew
a
long
breath
instinctively
she
felt
that
some
one
had
to
draw
one
after
that
speech
then
she
stole
a
glance
at
timothy
timothy
eyes
were
studiously
turned
away
the
three
were
off
at
last
with
pollyanna
trunk
in
behind
and
pollyanna
herself
snugly
ensconced
between
nancy
and
timothy
during
the
whole
process
of
getting
started
the
little
girl
had
kept
up
an
uninterrupted
stream
of
comments
and
questions
until
the
somewhat
dazed
nancy
found
herself
quite
out
of
breath
trying
to
keep
up
with
her
there
is
this
lovely
is
it
far
i
hope
is
i
love
to
ride
sighed
pollyanna
as
the
wheels
began
to
turn
of
course
if
far
i
mind
though
i
be
glad
to
get
there
all
the
sooner
you
know
what
a
pretty
street
i
knew
was
going
to
be
pretty
father
told
me
she
stopped
with
a
little
choking
breath
nancy
looking
at
her
apprehensively
saw
that
her
small
chin
was
quivering
and
that
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
in
a
moment
however
she
hurried
on
with
a
brave
lifting
of
her
head
father
told
me
all
about
it
he
remembered
and
and
i
ought
to
have
explained
before
gray
told
me
to
at
once
about
this
red
gingham
dress
you
know
and
why
i
not
in
black
she
said
you
think
was
queer
but
there
were
any
black
things
in
the
last
missionary
barrel
only
a
lady
velvet
basque
which
deacon
carr
wife
said
suitable
for
me
at
all
besides
it
had
white
spots
worn
you
know
on
both
elbows
and
some
other
places
part
of
the
ladies
aid
wanted
to
buy
me
a
black
dress
and
hat
but
the
other
part
thought
the
money
ought
to
go
toward
the
red
carpet
they
trying
to
get
for
the
church
you
know
white
said
maybe
it
was
just
as
well
anyway
for
she
like
children
in
black
that
is
i
mean
she
liked
the
children
of
course
but
not
the
black
pollyanna
paused
for
breath
and
nancy
managed
to
stammer
well
i
sure
it
it
be
all
i
glad
you
feel
that
way
i
do
too
nodded
pollyanna
again
with
that
choking
little
breath
of
course
have
been
a
good
deal
harder
to
be
glad
in
black
glad
gasped
nancy
surprised
into
an
interruption
yes
that
father
gone
to
heaven
to
be
with
mother
and
the
rest
of
us
you
know
he
said
i
must
be
glad
but
it
been
pretty
hard
to
to
do
it
even
in
red
gingham
because
i
i
wanted
him
so
and
i
help
feeling
i
ought
to
have
him
specially
as
mother
and
the
rest
have
god
and
all
the
angels
while
i
did
have
anybody
but
the
ladies
aid
but
now
i
sure
it
be
easier
because
i
got
you
aunt
polly
so
glad
i
got
you
nancy
aching
sympathy
for
the
poor
little
forlornness
beside
her
turned
suddenly
into
shocked
terror
oh
but
but
you
made
an
awful
mistake
she
faltered
only
nancy
i
ai
your
aunt
polly
at
all
you
you
are
stammered
the
little
girl
in
plain
dismay
no
i
only
nancy
i
never
thought
of
your
takin
me
for
her
we
we
ai
a
bit
alike
we
ai
we
ai
timothy
chuckled
softly
but
nancy
was
too
disturbed
to
answer
the
merry
flash
from
his
eyes
but
who
are
you
questioned
pollyanna
you
do
look
a
bit
like
a
ladies
aider
timothy
laughed
outright
this
time
i
nancy
the
hired
girl
i
do
all
the
work
except
the
washin
hard
ironin
mis
durgin
does
but
there
is
an
aunt
polly
demanded
the
child
anxiously
you
bet
your
life
there
is
cut
in
timothy
pollyanna
relaxed
visibly
oh
that
all
right
there
was
a
moment
silence
then
she
went
on
brightly
and
do
you
know
i
glad
after
all
that
she
come
to
meet
me
because
now
i
got
her
still
coming
and
i
got
you
nancy
flushed
timothy
turned
to
her
with
a
quizzical
smile
i
call
that
a
pretty
slick
compliment
he
said
why
do
you
thank
the
little
lady
i
i
was
thinkin
about
miss
polly
faltered
nancy
pollyanna
sighed
contentedly
i
was
too
i
so
interested
in
her
you
know
she
all
the
aunt
got
and
i
did
know
i
had
her
for
ever
so
long
then
father
told
me
he
said
she
lived
in
a
lovely
great
big
house
on
top
of
a
she
does
you
can
see
it
now
said
nancy
it
that
big
white
one
with
the
green
blinds
oh
how
pretty
and
what
a
lot
of
trees
and
grass
all
around

i

a
lot
of
green
grass

nancy
shook
her
head

lips
twitched
she
threw
a
merry
look
into
timothy
eyes
no
miss

aunt

i
guess
leastways
i
never
saw
it
on
her
pollyanna

maybe
aunt
polly

got
the
carpets
yes
she
got
the

every
room
well
in
almost
every
room
answered
nancy
frowning
suddenly
at
the
thought
of
that
bare
little
attic
room
where
there
was
no
carpet
oh
i
so
glad
exulted
pollyanna
i
love
carpets
we
did
have
any
only
two
little
rugs
that
came
in
a
missionary
barrel
and
one
of
those
had
ink
spots
on
it
white
had
pictures
too
perfectly
beautiful
ones
of
roses
and
little
girls
kneeling
and
a
kitty
and
some
lambs
and
a
lion
not
together
you
know
the
lambs
and
the
lion
oh
of
course
the
bible
says
they
will
sometime
but
they
have
yet
that
is
i
mean
white
have
do
you
just
love
pictures
i
i
do
know
answered
nancy
in
a
voice
i
do
we
did
have
any
pictures
they
do
come
in
the
barrels
much
you
know
there
did
two
come
once
though
but
one
was
so
good
father
sold
it
to
get
money
to
buy
me
some
shoes
with
and
the
other
was
so
bad
it
fell
to
pieces
just
as
soon
as
we
hung
it
up
glass
it
broke
you
know
and
i
cried
but
i
glad
now
we
did
have
any
of
those
nice
things
i
shall
like
aunt
polly
all
the
better
not
being
used
to
you
see
just
as
it
is
when
the
pretty
come
in
the
barrels
after
a
lot
of
brown
ones
my
but
is
this
a
perfectly
beautiful
house
she
broke
off
fervently
as
they
turned
into
the
wide
driveway
it
was
when
timothy
was
unloading
the
trunk
that
nancy
found
an
opportunity
to
mutter
low
in
his
ear
do
you
never
say
nothin
ter
me
again
about
leavin
timothy
durgin
you
could
hire
me
ter
leave
leave
i
should
say
not
grinned
the
youth
you
could
drag
me
away
it
be
more
fun
here
now
with
that
kid
than
shows
every
day
fun
fun
repeated
nancy
indignantly
i
guess
it
be
more
than
fun
for
that
blessed
child
when
them
two
tries
ter
live
tergether
and
i
guess
she
be
some
rock
ter
fly
to
for
refuge
well
i
ter
be
that
rock
timothy
i
am
i
am
she
vowed
as
she
turned
and
led
pollyanna
up
the
broad
steps
chapter
iv
the
little
attic
room
miss
polly
harrington
did
not
rise
to
meet
her
niece
she
looked
up
from
her
book
it
is
true
as
nancy
and
the
little
girl
appeared
in
the
doorway
and
she
held
out
a
hand
with
duty
written
large
on
every
coldly
extended
finger
how
do
you
do
pollyanna
i
she
had
no
chance
to
say
more
pollyanna
had
fairly
flown
across
the
room
and
flung
herself
into
her
aunt
scandalized
unyielding
lap
oh
aunt
polly
aunt
polly
i
do
know
how
to
be
glad
enough
that
you
let
me
come
to
live
with
you
she
was
sobbing
you
do
know
how
perfectly
lovely
it
is
to
have
you
and
nancy
and
all
this
after
had
just
the
ladies
aid
very
likely
though
i
not
had
the
pleasure
of
the
ladies
acquaintance
rejoined
miss
polly
stiffly
trying
to
unclasp
the
small
clinging
fingers
and
turning
frowning
eyes
on
nancy
in
the
doorway
nancy
that
will
do
you
may
go
pollyanna
be
good
enough
please
to
stand
erect
in
a
proper
manner
i
do
know
yet
what
you
look
pollyanna
drew
back
at
once
laughing
a
little
hysterically
no
i
suppose
you
do
but
you
see
i
not
very
much
to
look
at
anyway
on
account
of
the
freckles
oh
and
i
ought
to
explain
about
the
red
gingham
and
the
black
velvet
basque
with
white
spots
on
the
elbows
i
told
nancy
how
father
said
yes
well
never
mind
now
what
your
father
said
interrupted
miss
polly
crisply
you
had
a
trunk
i
presume
oh
yes
indeed
aunt
polly
i
got
a
beautiful
trunk
that
the
ladies
aid
gave
me
i
have
got
so
very
much
in
it
of
my
own
i
mean
the
barrels
have
had
many
clothes
for
little
girls
in
them
lately
but
there
were
all
father
books
and
white
said
she
thought
i
ought
to
have
those
you
see
father
pollyanna
interrupted
her
aunt
again
sharply
there
is
one
thing
that
might
just
as
well
be
understood
right
away
at
once
and
that
is
i
do
not
care
to
have
you
keep
talking
of
your
father
to
the
little
girl
drew
in
her
breath
tremulously
why
aunt
polly
you
you
mean
she
hesitated
and
her
aunt
filled
the
pause
we
will
go
to
your
room
your
trunk
is
already
there
i
presume
i
told
timothy
to
take
it
up
if
you
had
one
you
may
follow
me
without
speaking
pollyanna
turned
and
followed
her
aunt
from
the
room
her
eyes
were
brimming
with
tears
but
her
chin
was
bravely
high
after
all
i
i
reckon
i
glad
she
does
want
me
to
talk
about
father
pollyanna
was
thinking
it
be
easier
maybe
if
i
talk
about
him
probably
anyhow
that
is
why
she
told
me
not
to
talk
about
and
pollyanna
convinced
anew
of
her
aunt
kindness
blinked
off
the
tears
and
looked
eagerly
about
her
she
was
on
the
stairway
now
just
ahead
her
aunt
black
silk
skirt
rustled
luxuriously
behind
her
an
open
door
allowed
a
glimpse
of
rugs
and
chairs
beneath
her
feet
a
marvellous
carpet
was
like
green
moss
to
the
tread
on
every
side
the
gilt
of
picture
frames
or
the
glint
of
sunlight
through
the
filmy
mesh
of
lace
curtains
flashed
in
her
eyes
oh
aunt
polly
aunt
polly
breathed
the
little
girl
rapturously
what
a
perfectly
lovely
lovely
house
how
awfully
glad
you
must
be
you
so
rich
pollyanna
ejaculated
her
aunt
turning
sharply
about
as
she
reached
the
head
of
the
stairs
i
surprised
at
you
making
a
speech
like
that
to
me
why
aunt
polly
are
you
queried
pollyanna
in
frank
wonder
certainly
not
pollyanna
i
hope
i
could
not
so
far
forget
myself
as
to
be
sinfully
proud
of
any
gift
the
lord
has
seen
fit
to
bestow
upon
me
declared
the
lady
certainly
not
of
riches
miss
polly
turned
and
walked
down
the
hall
toward
the
attic
stairway
door
she
was
glad
now
that
she
had
put
the
child
in
the
attic
room
her
idea
at
first
had
been
to
get
her
niece
as
far
away
as
possible
from
herself
and
at
the
same
time
place
her
where
her
childish
heedlessness
would
not
destroy
valuable
furnishings
now
with
this
evident
strain
of
vanity
showing
thus
early
it
was
all
the
more
fortunate
that
the
room
planned
for
her
was
plain
and
sensible
thought
miss
polly
eagerly
pollyanna
small
feet
pattered
behind
her
aunt
still
more
eagerly
her
big
blue
eyes
tried
to
look
in
all
directions
at
once
that
no
thing
of
beauty
or
interest
in
this
wonderful
house
might
be
passed
unseen
most
eagerly
of
all
her
mind
turned
to
the
wondrously
exciting
problem
about
to
be
solved
behind
which
of
all
these
fascinating
doors
was
waiting
now
her
room
the
dear
beautiful
room
full
of
curtains
rugs
and
pictures
that
was
to
be
her
very
own
then
abruptly
her
aunt
opened
a
door
and
ascended
another
stairway
there
was
little
to
be
seen
here
a
bare
wall
rose
on
either
side
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
wide
reaches
of
shadowy
space
led
to
far
corners
where
the
roof
came
almost
down
to
the
floor
and
where
were
stacked
innumerable
trunks
and
boxes
it
was
hot
and
stifling
too
unconsciously
pollyanna
lifted
her
head
higher
it
seemed
so
hard
to
breathe
then
she
saw
that
her
aunt
had
thrown
open
a
door
at
the
right
there
pollyanna
here
is
your
room
and
your
trunk
is
here
i
see
have
you
your
key
pollyanna
nodded
dumbly
her
eyes
were
a
little
wide
and
frightened
her
aunt
frowned
when
i
ask
a
question
pollyanna
i
prefer
that
you
should
answer
aloud
not
merely
with
your
yes
aunt
thank
you
that
is
better
i
believe
you
have
everything
that
you
need
here
she
added
glancing
at
the
towel
rack
and
water
pitcher
i
will
send
nancy
up
to
help
you
unpack
supper
is
at
six
she
finished
as
she
left
the
room
and
swept
for
a
moment
after
she
had
gone
pollyanna
stood
quite
still
looking
after
her
then
she
turned
her
wide
eyes
to
the
bare
wall
the
bare
floor
the
bare
windows
she
turned
them
last
to
the
little
trunk
that
had
stood
not
so
long
before
in
her
own
little
room
in
the
western
home
the
next
moment
she
stumbled
blindly
toward
it
and
fell
on
her
knees
at
its
side
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
nancy
found
her
there
when
she
came
up
a
few
minutes
later
there
there
you
poor
lamb
she
crooned
dropping
to
the
floor
and
drawing
the
little
girl
into
her
arms
i
was
just
i
find
you
like
this
like
pollyanna
shook
her
head
but
i
bad
and
wicked
nancy
awful
wicked
she
sobbed
i
just
make
myself
understand
that
god
and
the
angels
needed
my
father
more
than
i
no
more
they
did
neither
declared
nancy
stoutly
nancy
the
burning
horror
in
pollyanna
eyes
dried
the
tears
nancy
gave
a
shamefaced
smile
and
rubbed
her
own
eyes
vigorously
there
there
child
i
did
mean
it
of
course
she
cried
briskly
come
let
have
your
key
and
we
get
inside
this
trunk
and
take
out
your
dresses
in
no
time
no
somewhat
tearfully
pollyanna
produced
the
key
there
are
very
many
there
anyway
she
faltered
then
they
all
the
sooner
unpacked
declared
nancy
pollyanna
gave
a
sudden
radiant
smile
that
so
i
can
be
glad
of
that
ca
i
she
cried
nancy
stared
why
of
course
she
answered
a
little
uncertainly
nancy
capable
hands
made
short
work
of
unpacking
the
books
the
patched
undergarments
and
the
few
pitifully
unattractive
dresses
pollyanna
smiling
bravely
now
flew
about
hanging
the
dresses
in
the
closet
stacking
the
books
on
the
table
and
putting
away
the
undergarments
in
the
bureau
drawers
i
sure
it
it
going
to
be
a
very
nice
room
do
you
think
so
she
stammered
after
a
while
there
was
no
answer
nancy
was
very
busy
apparently
with
her
head
in
the
trunk
pollyanna
standing
at
the
bureau
gazed
a
little
wistfully
at
the
bare
wall
above
and
i
can
be
glad
there
is
any
here
too
where
there
is
any
glass
i
ca
see
my
nancy
made
a
sudden
queer
little
sound
with
her
mouth
but
when
pollyanna
turned
her
head
was
in
the
trunk
again
at
one
of
the
windows
a
few
minutes
later
pollyanna
gave
a
glad
cry
and
clapped
her
hands
joyously
oh
nancy
i
had
seen
this
before
she
breathed
look
off
there
with
those
trees
and
the
houses
and
that
lovely
church
spire
and
the
river
shining
just
like
silver
why
nancy
there
does
anybody
need
any
pictures
with
that
to
look
at
oh
i
so
glad
now
she
let
me
have
this
room
to
pollyanna
surprise
and
dismay
nancy
burst
into
tears
pollyanna
hurriedly
crossed
to
her
side
why
nancy
nancy
what
is
it
she
cried
then
fearfully
this
was
your
room
was
it
my
room
stormed
nancy
hotly
choking
back
the
tears
if
you
a
little
angel
straight
from
heaven
and
if
some
folks
do
eat
dirt
before
oh
land
there
her
bell
after
which
amazing
speech
nancy
sprang
to
her
feet
dashed
out
of
the
room
and
went
clattering
down
the
stairs
left
alone
pollyanna
went
back
to
her
picture
as
she
mentally
designated
the
beautiful
view
from
the
window
after
a
time
she
touched
the
sash
tentatively
it
seemed
as
if
no
longer
could
she
endure
the
stifling
heat
to
her
joy
the
sash
moved
under
her
fingers
the
next
moment
the
window
was
wide
open
and
pollyanna
was
leaning
far
out
drinking
in
the
fresh
sweet
air
she
ran
then
to
the
other
window
that
too
soon
flew
up
under
her
eager
hands
a
big
fly
swept
past
her
nose
and
buzzed
noisily
about
the
room
then
another
came
and
another
but
pollyanna
paid
no
heed
pollyanna
had
made
a
wonderful
discovery
against
this
window
a
huge
tree
flung
great
branches
to
pollyanna
they
looked
like
arms
outstretched
inviting
her
suddenly
she
laughed
aloud
i
believe
i
can
do
it
she
chuckled
the
next
moment
she
had
climbed
nimbly
to
the
window
ledge
from
there
it
was
an
easy
matter
to
step
to
the
nearest
then
clinging
like
a
monkey
she
swung
herself
from
limb
to
limb
until
the
lowest
branch
was
reached
the
drop
to
the
ground
was
even
for
pollyanna
who
was
used
to
climbing
trees
a
little
fearsome
she
took
it
however
with
bated
breath
swinging
from
her
strong
little
arms
and
landing
on
all
fours
in
the
soft
grass
then
she
picked
herself
up
and
looked
eagerly
about
her
she
was
at
the
back
of
the
house
before
her
lay
a
garden
in
which
a
bent
old
man
was
working
beyond
the
garden
a
little
path
through
an
open
field
led
up
a
steep
hill
at
the
top
of
which
a
lone
pine
tree
stood
on
guard
beside
the
huge
rock
to
pollyanna
at
the
moment
there
seemed
to
be
just
one
place
in
the
world
worth
being
in
the
top
of
that
big
rock
with
a
run
and
a
skilful
turn
pollyanna
skipped
by
the
bent
old
man
threaded
her
way
between
the
orderly
rows
of
green
growing
things
and
a
little
out
of
breath
reached
the
path
that
ran
through
the
open
field
then
determinedly
she
began
to
climb
already
however
she
was
thinking
what
a
long
long
way
off
that
rock
must
be
when
back
at
the
window
it
had
looked
so
near
fifteen
minutes
later
the
great
clock
in
the
hallway
of
the
harrington
homestead
struck
six
at
precisely
the
last
stroke
nancy
sounded
the
bell
for
supper
one
two
three
minutes
passed
miss
polly
frowned
and
tapped
the
floor
with
her
slipper
a
little
jerkily
she
rose
to
her
feet
went
into
the
hall
and
looked
plainly
impatient
for
a
minute
she
listened
intently
then
she
turned
and
swept
into
the
dining
room
nancy
she
said
with
decision
as
soon
as
the
little
appeared
my
niece
is
late
no
you
need
not
call
her
she
added
severely
as
nancy
made
a
move
toward
the
hall
door
i
told
her
what
time
supper
was
and
now
she
will
have
to
suffer
the
consequences
she
may
as
well
begin
at
once
to
learn
to
be
punctual
when
she
comes
down
she
may
have
bread
and
milk
in
the
yes
it
was
well
perhaps
that
miss
polly
did
not
happen
to
be
looking
at
nancy
face
just
then
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
after
supper
nancy
crept
up
the
back
stairs
and
thence
to
the
attic
room
bread
and
milk
indeed
and
when
the
poor
lamb
hai
only
just
cried
herself
to
sleep
she
was
muttering
fiercely
as
she
softly
pushed
open
the
door
the
next
moment
she
gave
a
frightened
cry
where
are
you
where
you
gone
where
have
you
gone
she
panted
looking
in
the
closet
under
the
bed
and
even
in
the
trunk
and
down
the
water
pitcher
then
she
flew
and
out
to
old
tom
in
the
garden
mr
tom
tom
that
blessed
child
gone
she
wailed
vanished
right
up
into
heaven
where
she
come
from
poor
lamb
and
me
told
ter
give
her
bread
and
milk
in
the
kitchen
her
what
eatin
angel
food
this
minute
i
warrant
i
warrant
the
old
man
straightened
up
gone
heaven
he
repeated
stupidly
unconsciously
sweeping
the
brilliant
sunset
sky
with
his
gaze
he
stopped
stared
a
moment
intently
then
turned
with
a
slow
grin
well
nancy
it
do
look
like
as
if
she
tried
ter
get
as
nigh
heaven
as
she
could
and
that
a
fact
he
agreed
pointing
with
a
crooked
finger
to
where
sharply
outlined
against
the
reddening
sky
a
slender
figure
was
poised
on
top
of
a
huge
rock
well
she
ai
goin
ter
heaven
that
way
not
if
i
has
my
say
declared
nancy
doggedly
if
the
mistress
asks
tell
her
i
furgettin
the
dishes
but
i
gone
on
a
stroll
she
flung
back
over
her
shoulder
as
she
sped
toward
the
path
that
led
through
the
open
field
chapter
the
game
for
the
land
sake
miss
pollyanna
what
a
scare
you
did
give
me
panted
nancy
hurrying
up
to
the
big
rock
down
which
pollyanna
had
just
regretfully
slid
scare

so

but
you

nancy

too
till

cried
nancy
tucking
the
little
girl
hand
under
her
arm
and
hurrying
her
down
the
hill
i
did
see

go
and
nobody
did
i
guess

flew
right
up
through
the
roof

pollyanna
skipped
gleefully
i

only
i
flew

down
the
nancy

short

cheerfully

nancy

pollyanna
plainly
disturbed
no
er
yes
well
never

i
i
ai
so
very
particular
about

stammered
nancy
determined
to
keep
one
scolding
from
pollyanna
if
nothing
more
but
say
we
better
hurry
i
got
ter
get
them
dishes

promised
pollyanna
promptly
oh
miss
pollyanna
demurred
nancy
for
a
moment
there
was
silence
the
sky
was
darkening
fast
pollyanna
took
a
firmer
hold
of
her
friend
arm
i
reckon
i
glad
after
all
that
you
did
get
scared
a
little
then
you
came
after
me
she
shivered
poor
little
lamb
and
you
must
be
hungry
too
i
i
afraid

ter

and

nancy
dryly
stifling
a
chuckle
i
sorry
about

bread
and
milk
i
am
i
oh

not
i
glad
why
why
i
like

and
i
like
to

i
do
see
any
trouble
about
being
glad
about
you
do
seem
ter
see
any
trouble
bein
glad
about
everythin
retorted
nancy
choking
a
little
over
her
remembrance
of
brave
attempts
to
like
the
bare
little
attic
room
pollyanna
laughed
softly
well
that
the
game
you
know
the
game
yes
the
being
glad
whatever
in
the
world
are
you
talkin
about
why
it
a
game
father
told
it
to
me
and
it
lovely
rejoined
pollyanna
we
played
it
always
ever
since
i
was
a
little
little
girl
i
told
the
ladies
aid
and
they
played
it
some
of
what
is
it
i
ai
much
on
games
pollyanna
laughed
again
but
she
sighed
too
and
in
the
gathering
twilight
her
face
looked
thin
and
wistful
why
we
began
it
on
some
crutches
that
came
in
a
missionary
crutches
yes
you
see
i
wanted
a
doll
and
father
had
written
them
so
but
when
the
barrel
came
the
lady
wrote
that
there
had
any
dolls
come
in
but
the
little
crutches
had
so
she
sent
along
as
they
might
come
in
handy
for
some
child
sometime
and
that
when
we
began
well
i
must
say
i
ca
see
any
game
about
that
about
that
declared
nancy
almost
irritably
oh
yes
the
game
was
to
just
find
something
about
everything
to
be
glad
about
no
matter
what
was
rejoined
pollyanna
earnestly
and
we
began
right
then
on
the
well
goodness
me
i
ca
see
anythin
ter
be
glad
about
gettin
a
pair
of
crutches
when
you
wanted
a
doll
pollyanna
clapped
her
hands
there
is
there
is
she
crowed
but
could
see
it
either
nancy
at
first
she
added
with
quick
honesty
father
had
to
tell
it
to
well
then
suppose
you
tell
me
almost
snapped
nancy
goosey
why
just
be
glad
because
you
do
need
exulted
pollyanna
triumphantly
you
see
it
just
as
easy
when
you
know
how
well
of
all
the
queer
doin
breathed
nancy
regarding
pollyanna
with
almost
fearful
eyes
oh
but
it
is
queer
it
lovely
maintained
pollyanna
enthusiastically
and
we
played
it
ever
since
and
the
harder
is
the
more
fun
is
to
get
out
only
only
sometimes
it
almost
too
hard
like
when
your
father
goes
to
heaven
and
there
is
anybody
but
a
ladies
aid
yes
or
when
you
put
in
a
snippy
little
room
at
the
top
of
the
house
with
nothin
in
it
growled
nancy
pollyanna
sighed
that
was
a
hard
one
at
first
she
admitted
specially
when
i
was
so
kind
of
lonesome
i
just
did
feel
like
playing
the
game
anyway
and
i
had
been
wanting
pretty
things
so
then
i
happened
to
think
how
i
hated
to
see
my
freckles
in
the
and
i
saw
that
lovely
picture
out
the
window
too
so
then
i
knew
i
found
the
things
to
be
glad
about
you
see
when
you
hunting
for
the
glad
things
you
sort
of
forget
the
other
kind
like
the
doll
you
wanted
you
humph
choked
nancy
trying
to
swallow
the
lump
in
her
throat
most
generally
it
does
take
so
long
sighed
pollyanna
and
lots
of
times
now
i
just
think
of
them
without
thinking
you
know
i
got
so
used
to
playing
it
it
a
lovely
game
and
i
used
to
like
it
so
much
she
faltered
i
suppose
though
it
it
be
a
little
harder
now
as
long
as
i
have
anybody
to
play
it
with
maybe
aunt
polly
will
play
it
though
she
added
as
an
my
stars
and
stockings
her
breathed
nancy
behind
her
teeth
then
aloud
she
said
doggedly
see
here
miss
pollyanna
i
ai
sayin
that
i
play
it
very
well
and
i
ai
sayin
that
i
know
how
anyway
but
i
play
it
with
ye

she
finished
as
they
entered
the
kitchen
together
pollyanna
ate
her
bread
and
milk
with
good
appetite
then
at
suggestion
she
went
into
the
sitting
room
where
her
aunt
sat
reading
miss
polly
looked
up
coldly
have
you
had
your
supper
pollyanna
yes
aunt
i
very
sorry
pollyanna
to
have
been
obliged
so
soon
to
send
you
into
the
kitchen
to
eat
bread
and
but
i
was
real
glad
you
did
it
aunt
polly
i
like
bread
and
milk
and
nancy
too
you
must
feel
bad
about
that
one
aunt
polly
sat
suddenly
a
little
more
erect
in
her
chair
pollyanna
it
quite
time
you
were
in
bed
you
have
had
a
hard
day
and
we
must
plan
your
hours
and
go
over
your
clothing
to
see
what
it
is
necessary
to
get
for
you
nancy
will
give
you
a
candle
be
careful
how
you
handle
it
breakfast
will
be
at
seven
see
that
you
are
down
to
that
quite
as
a
matter
of
course
pollyanna
came
straight
to
her
aunt
side
and
gave
her
an
affectionate
hug
i
had
such
a
beautiful
time
so
far
she
sighed
happily
i
know
i
going
to
just
love
living
with
you
but
then
i
knew
i
should
before
i
came
she
called
cheerfully
as
she
ran
from
the
room
well
upon
my
soul
ejaculated
miss
polly
half
aloud
what
a
most
extraordinary
child
then
she
frowned
she
i
punished
her
and
i
feel
bad
one
bit
and
she
going
to
to
live
with
me
well
upon
my
soul
ejaculated
miss
polly
again
as
she
took
up
her
book
fifteen
minutes
later
in
the
attic
room
a
lonely
little
girl
sobbed
into
the
sheet
i
know
i
not
playing
the
game
one
bit
now
not
one
bit
but
i
do
believe
even
you
could
find
anything
to
be
glad
about
sleeping
all
alone
off
up
here
in
the
dark
like
this
if
only
i
was
near
nancy
or
aunt
polly
or
even
a
ladies
aider
it
would
be
easier
in
the
kitchen
nancy
hurrying
with
her
belated
work
jabbed
her
into
the
milk
pitcher
and
muttered
jerkily
if
playin
a
game
about
bein
glad
you
got
crutches
when
you
want
dolls
is
got
ter
be
my
way

chapter
vi
a
question
of
duty
it
was
nearly
seven
when
pollyanna
awoke
that
first
day
after
her
arrival
her
windows
faced
the
south
and
the
west
so
she
could
not
see
the
sun
yet
but
she
could
see
the
hazy
blue
of
the
morning
sky
and
she
knew
that
the
day
promised
to
be
a
fair
one
the
little
room
was
cooler
now
and
the
air
blew
in
fresh
and
sweet
outside
the
birds
were
twittering
joyously
and
pollyanna
flew
to
the
window
to
talk
to
them
she
saw
then
that
down
in
the
garden
her
aunt
was
already
out
among
the
rosebushes
with
rapid
fingers
therefore
she
made
herself
ready
to
join
her
down
the
attic
stairs
sped
pollyanna
leaving
both
doors
wide
open
through
the
hall
down
the
next
flight
then
bang
through
the
front
and
around
to
the
garden
she
ran
aunt
polly
with
the
bent
old
man
was
leaning
over
a
when
pollyanna
gurgling
with
delight
flung
herself
upon
her
oh
aunt
polly
aunt
polly
i
reckon
i
am
glad
this
morning
just
to
be
alive
pollyanna
remonstrated
the
lady
sternly
pulling
herself
as
erect
as
she
could
with
a
dragging
weight
of
ninety
pounds
hanging
about
her
neck
is
this
the
usual
way
you
say
good
morning
the
little
girl
dropped
to
her
toes
and
danced
lightly
up
and
down
no
only
when
i
love
folks
so
i
just
ca
help
it
i
saw
you
from
my
window
aunt
polly
and
i
got
to
thinking
how
you
were
a
aider
and
you
were
my
really
truly
aunt
and
you
looked
so
good
i
just
had
to
come
down
and
hug
you
the
bent
old
man
turned
his
back
suddenly
miss
polly
attempted
a
frown
with
not
her
usual
success
pollyanna
you
i
thomas
that
will
do
for
this
morning
i
think
you
understand
about
those
she
said
stiffly
then
she
turned
and
walked
rapidly
away
do
you
always
work
in
the
garden
man
asked
pollyanna
interestedly
the
man
turned
his
lips
were
twitching
but
his
eyes
looked
blurred
as
if
with
tears
yes
miss
i
old
tom
the
gardener
he
answered
timidly
but
as
if
impelled
by
an
irresistible
force
he
reached
out
a
shaking
hand
and
let
it
rest
for
a
moment
on
her
bright
hair
you
are
so
like
your
mother
little
miss
i
used
ter
know
her
when
she
was
even
littler
than
you
be
you
see
i
used
ter
work
in
the
garden
pollyanna
caught
her
breath
audibly
you
did
and
you
knew
my
mother
really
when
she
was
just
a
little
earth
angel
and
not
a
heaven
one
oh
please
tell
me
about
her
and
down
plumped
pollyanna
in
the
middle
of
the
dirt
path
by
the
old
side
a
bell
sounded
from
the
house
the
next
moment
nancy
was
seen
flying
out
the
back
door
miss
pollyanna
that
bell
means
breakfast
mornin
she
panted
pulling
the
little
girl
to
her
feet
and
hurrying
her
back
to
the
house
and
other
times
it
means
other
meals
but
it
always
means
that
you
ter
run
like
time
when
ye
hear
it
no
matter
where
ye
be
if
ye
do
well
it
take
somethin
we
be
ter
find
anythin
ter
be
glad
about
in
that
she
finished
shooing
pollyanna
into
the
house
as
she
would
shoo
an
unruly
chicken
into
a
coop
breakfast
for
the
first
five
minutes
was
a
silent
meal
then
miss
polly
her
disapproving
eyes
following
the
airy
wings
of
two
flies
darting
here
and
there
over
the
table
said
sternly
nancy
where
did
those
flies
come
from
i
do
know
there
was
one
in
the
nancy
had
been
too
excited
to
notice
pollyanna
windows
the
afternoon
before
i
reckon
maybe
they
my
flies
aunt
polly
observed
pollyanna
amiably
there
were
lots
of
them
this
morning
having
a
beautiful
time
nancy
left
the
room
precipitately
though
to
do
so
she
had
to
carry
out
the
hot
muffins
she
had
just
brought
in
yours
gasped
miss
polly
what
do
you
mean
where
did
they
come
from
why
aunt
polly
they
came
from
out
of
doors
of
course
through
the
windows
i
saw
some
of
them
come
you
saw
them
you
mean
you
raised
those
windows
without
any
screens
why
yes
there
were
any
screens
there
aunt
nancy
at
this
moment
came
in
again
with
the
muffins
her
face
was
grave
but
very
red
nancy
directed
her
mistress
sharply
you
may
set
the
muffins
down
and
go
at
once
to
miss
pollyanna
room
and
shut
the
windows
shut
the
doors
also
later
when
your
morning
work
is
done
go
through
every
room
with
the
spatter
see
that
you
make
a
thorough
to
her
niece
she
said
pollyanna
i
have
ordered
screens
for
those
windows
i
knew
of
course
that
it
was
my
duty
to
do
that
but
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
quite
forgotten
your
my
duty
pollyanna
eyes
were
wide
with
wonder
certainly
i
know
it
is
warm
but
i
consider
it
your
duty
to
keep
your
windows
closed
till
those
screens
come
flies
pollyanna
are
not
only
unclean
and
annoying
but
very
dangerous
to
health
after
breakfast
i
will
give
you
a
little
pamphlet
on
this
matter
to
to
read
oh
thank
you
aunt
polly
i
love
to
read
miss
polly
drew
in
her
breath
audibly
then
she
shut
her
lips
together
hard
pollyanna
seeing
her
stern
face
frowned
a
little
thoughtfully
of
course
i
sorry
about
the
duty
i
forgot
aunt
polly
she
apologized
timidly
i
wo
raise
the
windows
her
aunt
made
no
reply
she
did
not
speak
indeed
until
the
meal
was
over
then
she
rose
went
to
the
bookcase
in
the
sitting
room
took
out
a
small
paper
booklet
and
crossed
the
room
to
her
niece
side
this
is
the
article
i
spoke
of
pollyanna
i
desire
you
to
go
to
your
room
at
once
and
read
it
i
will
be
up
in
half
an
hour
to
look
over
your
pollyanna
her
eyes
on
the
illustration
of
a
fly
head
many
times
magnified
cried
joyously
oh
thank
you
aunt
polly
the
next
moment
she
skipped
merrily
from
the
room
banging
the
door
behind
her
miss
polly
frowned
hesitated
then
crossed
the
room
majestically
and
opened
the
door
but
pollyanna
was
already
out
of
sight
clattering
up
the
attic
stairs
half
an
hour
later
when
miss
polly
her
face
expressing
stern
duty
in
every
line
climbed
those
stairs
and
entered
pollyanna
room
she
was
greeted
with
a
burst
of
eager
enthusiasm
oh
aunt
polly
i
never
saw
anything
so
perfectly
lovely
and
interesting
in
my
life
i
so
glad
you
gave
me
that
book
to
read
why
i
did
suppose
flies
could
carry
such
a
lot
of
things
on
their
feet
and
that
will
do
observed
aunt
polly
with
dignity
pollyanna
you
may
bring
out
your
clothes
now
and
i
will
look
them
over
what
are
not
suitable
for
you
i
shall
give
to
the
sullivans
of
with
visible
reluctance
pollyanna
laid
down
the
pamphlet
and
turned
toward
the
closet
i
afraid
you
think
they
worse
than
the
ladies
aid
did
and
they
said
they
were
shameful
she
sighed
but
there
were
mostly
things
for
boys
and
older
folks
in
the
last
two
or
three
barrels
and
did
you
ever
have
a
missionary
barrel
aunt
polly
at
her
aunt
look
of
shocked
anger
pollyanna
corrected
herself
at
once
why
no
of
course
you
did
aunt
polly
she
hurried
on
with
a
hot
blush
i
forgot
rich
folks
never
have
to
have
them
but
you
see
sometimes
i
kind
of
forget
that
you
are
rich
up
here
in
this
room
you
miss
polly
lips
parted
indignantly
but
no
words
came
pollyanna
plainly
unaware
that
she
had
said
anything
in
the
least
unpleasant
was
hurrying
on
well
as
i
was
going
to
say
you
ca
tell
a
thing
about
missionary
barrels
except
that
you
wo
find
in
what
you
think
you
going
to
even
when
you
think
you
wo
it
was
the
barrels
every
time
too
that
were
hardest
to
play
the
game
on
for
father
and
just
in
time
pollyanna
remembered
that
she
was
not
to
talk
of
her
father
to
her
aunt
she
dived
into
her
closet
then
hurriedly
and
brought
out
all
the
poor
little
dresses
in
both
her
arms
they
are
nice
at
all
she
choked
and
they
been
black
if
it
had
been
for
the
red
carpet
for
the
church
but
they
all
with
the
tips
of
her
fingers
miss
polly
turned
over
the
conglomerate
garments
so
obviously
made
for
anybody
but
pollyanna
next
she
bestowed
frowning
attention
on
the
patched
undergarments
in
the
bureau
drawers
i
got
the
best
ones
on
confessed
pollyanna
anxiously
the
ladies
aid
bought
me
one
set
straight
through
all
whole
jones
she
the
president
told
i
should
have
that
if
they
had
to
clatter
down
bare
aisles
themselves
the
rest
of
their
days
but
they
wo
white
does
like
the
noise
he
got
nerves
his
wife
says
but
he
got
money
too
and
they
expect
he
give
a
lot
toward
the
carpet
on
account
of
the
nerves
you
know
i
should
think
he
be
glad
that
if
he
did
have
the
nerves
he
got
money
too
should
you
miss
polly
did
not
seem
to
hear
her
scrutiny
of
the
undergarments
finished
she
turned
to
pollyanna
somewhat
abruptly
you
have
been
to
school
of
course
pollyanna
oh
yes
aunt
polly
besides
fath
i
mean
i
was
taught
at
home
some
miss
polly
frowned
very
good
in
the
fall
you
will
enter
school
here
of
course
hall
the
principal
will
doubtless
settle
in
which
grade
you
belong
meanwhile
i
suppose
i
ought
to
hear
you
read
aloud
half
an
hour
each
i
love
to
read
but
if
you
do
want
to
hear
me
i
be
just
glad
to
read
to
myself
truly
aunt
polly
and
i
would
have
to
half
try
to
be
glad
either
for
i
like
best
to
read
to
myself
on
account
of
the
big
words
you
i
do
doubt
it
rejoined
miss
polly
grimly
have
you
studied
music
not
much
i
do
like
my
music
i
like
other
people
though
i
learned
to
play
on
the
piano
a
little
miss
gray
she
plays
for
church
she
taught
me
but
i
just
as
soon
let
that
go
as
not
aunt
polly
i
rather
very
likely
observed
aunt
polly
with
slightly
uplifted
eyebrows
nevertheless
i
think
it
is
my
duty
to
see
that
you
are
properly
instructed
in
at
least
the
rudiments
of
music
you
sew
of
yes
pollyanna
sighed
the
ladies
aid
taught
me
that
but
i
had
an
awful
time
jones
did
believe
in
holding
your
needle
like
the
rest
of
did
on
buttonholing
and
white
thought
backstitching
ought
to
be
taught
you
before
hemming
or
else
the
other
way
and
harriman
did
believe
in
putting
you
on
patchwork
ever
at
well
there
will
be
no
difficulty
of
that
kind
any
longer
pollyanna
i
shall
teach
you
sewing
myself
of
course
you
do
not
know
how
to
cook
i
pollyanna
laughed
suddenly
they
were
just
beginning
to
teach
me
that
this
summer
but
i
got
far
they
were
more
divided
up
on
that
than
they
were
on
the
sewing
they
were
going
to
begin
on
bread
but
there
was
two
of
that
made
it
alike
so
after
arguing
it
all
one
they
decided
to
take
turns
at
me
one
forenoon
a
week
in
their
own
kitchens
you
know
i
only
learned
chocolate
fudge
and
fig
cake
though
when
when
i
had
to
her
voice
broke
chocolate
fudge
and
fig
cake
indeed
scorned
miss
polly
i
think
we
can
remedy
that
very
she
paused
in
thought
for
a
minute
then
went
on
slowly
at
nine
every
morning
you
will
read
aloud
one
to
me
before
that
you
will
use
the
time
to
put
this
room
in
order
wednesday
and
saturday
forenoons
after
nine
you
will
spend
with
nancy
in
the
kitchen
learning
to
cook
other
mornings
you
will
sew
with
me
that
will
leave
the
afternoons
for
your
music
i
shall
of
course
procure
a
teacher
at
once
for
you
she
finished
decisively
as
she
arose
from
her
chair
pollyanna
cried
out
in
dismay
oh
but
aunt
polly
aunt
polly
you
have
left
me
any
time
at
all
just
to
to
to
live
child
what
do
you
mean
as
if
you
were
living
all
the
time
oh
of
course
i
be
breathing
all
the
time
i
was
doing
those
things
aunt
polly
but
i
would
be
living
you
breathe
all
the
time
asleep
but
you
are
living
i
mean
living
doing
the
things
you
want
to
do
playing
outdoors
reading
to
myself
of
course
climbing
hills
talking
to
tom
in
the
garden
and
nancy
and
finding
out
all
about
the
houses
and
the
people
and
everything
everywhere
all
through
the
perfectly
lovely
streets
i
came
through
yesterday
that
what
i
call
living
aunt
polly
just
breathing
is
living
miss
polly
lifted
her
head
irritably
pollyanna
you
are
the
most
extraordinary
child
you
will
be
allowed
a
proper
amount
of
playtime
of
course
but
surely
it
seems
to
me
if
i
am
willing
to
do
my
duty
in
seeing
that
you
have
proper
care
and
instruction
you
ought
to
be
willing
to
do
yours
by
seeing
that
that
care
and
instruction
are
not
ungratefully
pollyanna
looked
shocked
oh
aunt
polly
as
if
i
ever
could
be
ungrateful
to
you
why
i
love
you
and
you
are
even
a
ladies
aider
you
an
aunt
very
well
then
see
that
you
do
act
ungrateful
vouchsafed
miss
polly
as
she
turned
toward
the
door
she
had
gone
halfway
down
the
stairs
when
a
small
unsteady
voice
called
after
her
please
aunt
polly
you
did
tell
me
which
of
my
things
you
wanted
to
to
give
aunt
polly
emitted
a
tired
sigh
a
sigh
that
ascended
straight
to
pollyanna
ears
oh
i
forgot
to
tell
you
pollyanna
timothy
will
drive
us
into
town
at
one
this
afternoon
not
one
of
your
garments
is
fit
for
my
niece
to
wear
certainly
i
should
be
very
far
from
doing
my
duty
by
you
if
i
should
let
you
appear
out
in
any
one
of
pollyanna
sighed
now
she
believed
she
was
going
to
hate
that
word
duty
aunt
polly
please
she
called
wistfully
is
there
any
way
you
can
be
glad
about
all
that
duty
business
what
miss
polly
looked
up
in
dazed
surprise
then
suddenly
with
very
red
cheeks
she
turned
and
swept
angrily
down
the
stairs
do
be
impertinent
pollyanna
in
the
hot
little
attic
room
pollyanna
dropped
herself
on
to
one
of
the
chairs
to
her
existence
loomed
ahead
one
endless
round
of
duty
i
do
see
really
what
there
was
impertinent
about
that
she
sighed
i
was
only
asking
her
if
she
could
tell
me
something
to
be
glad
about
in
all
that
duty
for
several
minutes
pollyanna
sat
in
silence
her
rueful
eyes
fixed
on
the
forlorn
heap
of
garments
on
the
bed
then
slowly
she
rose
and
began
to
put
away
the
dresses
there
just
is
anything
to
be
glad
about
that
i
can
see
she
said
aloud
unless
it
to
be
glad
when
the
duty
done
whereupon
she
laughed
suddenly

pollyanna
and
punishments
at
one
timothy
drove
miss
polly
and
her
niece
to
the
four
or
five
principal
dry
goods
stores
which
were
about
half
a
mile
from
the
homestead
fitting
pollyanna
with
a
new
wardrobe
proved
to
be
more
or
less
of
an
exciting
experience
for
all
concerned
miss
polly
came
out
of
it
with
the
feeling
of
limp
relaxation
that
one
might
have
at
finding
oneself
at
last
on
solid
earth
after
a
perilous
walk
across
the
very
thin
crust
of
a
volcano
the
various
clerks
who
had
waited
upon
the
pair
came
out
of
it
with
very
red
faces
and
enough
amusing
stories
of
pollyanna
to
keep
their
friends
in
gales
of
laughter
the
rest
of
the
week
pollyanna
herself
came
out
of
it
with
radiant
smiles
and
a
heart
content
for
as
she
expressed
it
to
one
of
the
clerks
when
you
have
had
anybody
but
missionary
barrels
and
ladies
aiders
to
dress
you
it
is
perfectly
lovely
to
just
walk
right
in
and
buy
clothes
that
are
and
that
do
have
to
be
tucked
up
or
let
down
because
they
do
fit
the
shopping
expedition
consumed
the
entire
afternoon
then
came
supper
and
a
delightful
talk
with
old
tom
in
the
garden
and
another
with
nancy
on
the
back
porch
after
the
dishes
were
done
and
while
aunt
polly
paid
a
visit
to
a
neighbor
old
tom
told
pollyanna
wonderful
things
of
her
mother
that
made
her
very
happy
indeed
and
nancy
told
her
all
about
the
little
farm
six
miles
away
at
the
corners
where
lived
her
own
dear
mother
and
her
equally
dear
brother
and
sisters
she
promised
too
that
sometime
if
miss
polly
were
willing
pollyanna
should
be
taken
to
see
them
and
they
got
lovely
names
too
you
like
their
names
sighed
nancy
they
and
and
i
i
just
hate
oh
nancy
what
a
dreadful
thing
to
say
why
because
it
is
pretty
like
the
others
you
see
i
was
the
first
baby
and
mother
had
begun
ter
read
so
many
stories
with
the
pretty
names
in
but
i
love
just
because
it
you
declared
pollyanna
humph
well
i
guess
you
could
love
mabelle
just
as
well
retorted
nancy
and
it
would
be
a
heap
happier
for
me
i
think
that
name
just
grand
pollyanna
laughed
well
anyhow
she
chuckled
you
can
be
glad
it
is
hephzibah
yes
white
name
is
that
her
husband
calls
her
and
she
does
like
it
she
says
when
he
calls
out
hep
she
feels
just
as
if
the
next
minute
he
was
going
to
yell
and
she
like
to
be
hurrahed
nancy
gloomy
face
relaxed
into
a
broad
smile
well
if
you
do
beat
the
dutch
say
do
you
know
i
never
hear
now
that
i
do
think
o
that
hep
and
giggle
my
i
guess
i
am
glad
she
stopped
short
and
turned
amazed
eyes
on
the
little
girl
say
miss
pollyanna
do
you
mean
was
you
playin
that
game
then
about
my
bein
glad
i
named
hephzibah
pollyanna
frowned
then
she
laughed
why
nancy
that
so
i
was
playing
the
game
but
that
one
of
the
times
i
just
did
it
without
thinking
i
reckon
you
see
you
do
lots
of
times
you
get
so
used
to
it
looking
for
something
to
be
glad
about
you
know
and
most
generally
there
is
something
about
everything
that
you
can
be
glad
about
if
you
keep
hunting
long
enough
to
find
well
granted
nancy
with
open
doubt
at
eight
pollyanna
went
up
to
bed
the
screens
had
not
yet
come
and
the
close
little
room
was
like
an
oven
with
longing
eyes
pollyanna
looked
at
the
two
windows
but
she
did
not
raise
them
she
undressed
folded
her
clothes
neatly
said
her
prayers
blew
out
her
candle
and
climbed
into
bed
just
how
long
she
lay
in
sleepless
misery
tossing
from
side
to
side
of
the
hot
little
cot
she
did
not
know
but
it
seemed
to
her
that
it
must
have
been
hours
before
she
finally
slipped
out
of
bed
felt
her
way
across
the
room
and
opened
her
door
out
in
the
main
attic
all
was
velvet
blackness
save
where
the
moon
flung
a
path
of
silver
across
the
floor
from
the
east
dormer
window
with
a
resolute
ignoring
of
that
fearsome
darkness
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
pollyanna
drew
a
quick
breath
and
pattered
straight
into
that
silvery
path
and
on
to
the
window
she
had
hoped
vaguely
that
this
window
might
have
a
screen
but
it
did
not
outside
however
there
was
a
wide
world
of
beauty
and
there
was
too
she
knew
fresh
sweet
air
that
would
feel
so
good
to
hot
cheeks
and
hands
as
she
stepped
nearer
and
peered
longingly
out
she
saw
something
else
she
saw
only
a
little
way
below
the
window
the
wide
flat
tin
roof
of
miss
polly
sun
parlor
built
over
the
the
sight
filled
her
with
longing
if
only
now
she
were
out
there
fearfully
she
looked
behind
her
back
there
somewhere
were
her
hot
little
room
and
her
still
hotter
bed
but
between
her
and
them
lay
a
horrid
desert
of
blackness
across
which
one
must
feel
one
way
with
outstretched
shrinking
arms
while
before
her
out
on
the
roof
were
the
moonlight
and
the
cool
sweet
night
air
if
only
her
bed
were
out
there
and
folks
did
sleep
out
of
doors
joel
hartley
at
home
who
was
so
sick
with
the
consumption
had
to
sleep
out
of
doors
suddenly
pollyanna
remembered
that
she
had
seen
near
this
attic
window
a
row
of
long
white
bags
hanging
from
nails
nancy
had
said
that
they
contained
the
winter
clothing
put
away
for
the
summer
a
little
fearfully
now
pollyanna
felt
her
way
to
these
bags
selected
a
nice
fat
soft
one
it
contained
miss
polly
sealskin
coat
for
a
bed
and
a
thinner
one
to
be
doubled
up
for
a
pillow
and
still
another
which
was
so
thin
it
seemed
almost
empty
for
a
covering
thus
equipped
pollyanna
in
high
glee
pattered
to
the
moonlit
window
again
raised
the
sash
stuffed
her
burden
through
to
the
roof
below
then
let
herself
down
after
it
closing
the
window
carefully
behind
her
pollyanna
had
not
forgotten
those
flies
with
the
marvellous
feet
that
carried
things
how
deliciously
cool
it
was
pollyanna
quite
danced
up
and
down
with
delight
drawing
in
long
full
breaths
of
the
refreshing
air
the
tin
roof
under
her
feet
crackled
with
little
resounding
snaps
that
pollyanna
rather
liked
she
walked
indeed
two
or
three
times
back
and
forth
from
end
to
end
it
gave
her
such
a
pleasant
sensation
of
airy
space
after
her
hot
little
room
and
the
roof
was
so
broad
and
flat
that
she
had
no
fear
of
falling
off
finally
with
a
sigh
of
content
she
curled
herself
up
on
the
mattress
arranged
one
bag
for
a
pillow
and
the
other
for
a
covering
and
settled
herself
to
sleep
i
so
glad
now
that
the
screens
did
come
she
murmured
blinking
up
at
the
stars
else
i
could
have
had
this
in
miss
polly
room
next
the
sun
parlor
miss
polly
herself
was
hurrying
into
dressing
gown
and
slippers
her
face
white
and
frightened
a
minute
before
she
had
been
telephoning
in
a
shaking
voice
to
timothy
come
up
quick
you
and
your
father
bring
lanterns
somebody
is
on
the
roof
of
the
sun
parlor
he
must
have
climbed
up
the
or
somewhere
and
of
course
he
can
get
right
into
the
house
through
the
east
window
in
the
attic
i
have
locked
the
attic
door
down
here
but
hurry
quick
some
time
later
pollyanna
just
dropping
off
to
sleep
was
startled
by
a
lantern
flash
and
a
trio
of
amazed
ejaculations
she
opened
her
eyes
to
find
timothy
at
the
top
of
a
ladder
near
her
old
tom
just
getting
through
the
window
and
her
aunt
peering
out
at
her
from
behind
him
pollyanna
what
does
this
mean
cried
aunt
polly
then
pollyanna
blinked
sleepy
eyes
and
sat
up
why
tom
aunt
polly
she
stammered
do
look
so
scared
it
is
that
i
got
the
consumption
you
know
like
joel
hartley
only
that
i
was
so
hot
in
there
but
i
shut
the
window
aunt
polly
so
the
flies
could
carry
those
timothy
disappeared
suddenly
down
the
ladder
old
tom
with
almost
equal
precipitation
handed
his
lantern
to
miss
polly
and
followed
his
son
miss
polly
bit
her
lip
hard
until
the
men
were
gone
then
she
said
sternly
pollyanna
hand
those
things
to
me
at
once
and
come
in
here
of
all
the
extraordinary
children
she
ejaculated
a
little
later
as
with
pollyanna
by
her
side
and
the
lantern
in
her
hand
she
turned
back
into
the
attic
to
pollyanna
the
air
was
all
the
more
stifling
after
that
cool
breath
of
the
out
of
doors
but
she
did
not
complain
she
only
drew
a
long
quivering
sigh
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
miss
polly
jerked
out
crisply
for
the
rest
of
the
night
pollyanna
you
are
to
sleep
in
my
bed
with
me
the
screens
will
be
here
but
until
then
i
consider
it
my
duty
to
keep
you
where
i
know
where
you
pollyanna
drew
in
her
breath
with
you
in
your
bed
she
cried
rapturously
oh
aunt
polly
aunt
polly
how
perfectly
lovely
of
you
and
when
i
so
wanted
to
sleep
with
some
one
sometime
some
one
that
belonged
to
me
you
know
not
a
ladies
aider
i
had
them
my
i
reckon
i
am
glad
now
those
screens
did
come
would
you
be
there
was
no
reply
miss
polly
was
stalking
on
ahead
miss
polly
to
tell
the
truth
was
feeling
curiously
helpless
for
the
third
time
since
pollyanna
arrival
miss
polly
was
punishing
pollyanna
and
for
the
third
time
she
was
being
confronted
with
the
amazing
fact
that
her
punishment
was
being
taken
as
a
special
reward
of
merit
no
wonder
miss
polly
was
feeling
curiously
helpless
chapter
viii
pollyanna
pays
a
visit
it
was
not
long
before
life
at
the
harrington
homestead
settled
into
something
like
order
though
not
exactly
the
order
that
miss
polly
had
at
first
prescribed
pollyanna
sewed
practised
read
aloud
and
studied
cooking
in
the
kitchen
it
is
true
but
she
did
not
give
to
any
of
these
things
quite
so
much
time
as
had
first
been
planned
she
had
more
time
also
to
just
live
as
she
expressed
it
for
almost
all
of
every
afternoon
from
two
until
six
was
hers
to
do
with
as
she
liked
provided
she
did
not
like
to
do
certain
things
already
prohibited
by
aunt
polly
it
is
a
question
perhaps
whether
all
this
leisure
time
was
given
to
the
child
as
a
relief
to
pollyanna
from
work
or
as
a
relief
to
aunt
polly
from
pollyanna
certainly
as
those
first
july
days
passed
miss
polly
found
occasion
many
times
to
ejaculate
what
an
extraordinary
child
and
certainly
the
reading
and
sewing
lessons
found
her
at
their
conclusion
each
day
somewhat
dazed
and
wholly
exhausted
nancy
in
the
kitchen
fared
better
she
was
not
dazed
nor
exhausted
wednesdays
and
saturdays
came
to
be
indeed
days
to
her
there
were
no
children
in
the
immediate
neighborhood
of
the
harrington
homestead
for
pollyanna
to
play
with
the
house
itself
was
on
the
outskirts
of
the
village
and
though
there
were
other
houses
not
far
away
they
did
not
chance
to
contain
any
boys
or
girls
near
age
this
however
did
not
seem
to
disturb
pollyanna
in
the
least
oh
no
i
do
mind
it
at
all
she
explained
to
nancy
i
happy
just
to
walk
around
and
see
the
streets
and
the
houses
and
watch
the
people
i
just
love
people
do
you
nancy
well
i
ca
say
i
do
all
of
retorted
nancy
tersely
almost
every
pleasant
afternoon
found
pollyanna
begging
for
an
errand
to
run
so
that
she
might
be
off
for
a
walk
in
one
direction
or
another
and
it
was
on
these
walks
that
frequently
she
met
the
man
to
herself
pollyanna
always
called
him
the
man
no
matter
if
she
met
a
dozen
other
men
the
same
day
the
man
often
wore
a
long
black
coat
and
a
high
silk
hat
two
things
that
the
just
men
never
wore
his
face
was
clean
shaven
and
rather
pale
and
his
hair
showing
below
his
hat
was
somewhat
gray
he
walked
erect
and
rather
rapidly
and
he
was
always
alone
which
made
pollyanna
vaguely
sorry
for
him
perhaps
it
was
because
of
this
that
she
one
day
spoke
to
him
how
do
you
do
sir
is
this
a
nice
day
she
called
cheerily
as
she
approached
him
the
man
threw
a
hurried
glance
about
him
then
stopped
uncertainly
did
you
speak
to
me
he
asked
in
a
sharp
voice
yes
sir
beamed
pollyanna
i
say
it
a
nice
day
is
it
eh
oh
humph
he
grunted
and
strode
on
again
pollyanna
laughed
he
was
such
a
funny
man
she
thought
the
next
day
she
saw
him
again
is
quite
so
nice
as
yesterday
but
it
pretty
nice
she
called
out
cheerfully
eh
oh
humph
grunted
the
man
as
before
and
once
again
pollyanna
laughed
happily
when
for
the
third
time
pollyanna
accosted
him
in
much
the
same
manner
the
man
stopped
abruptly
see
here
child
who
are
you
and
why
are
you
speaking
to
me
every
day
i
pollyanna
whittier
and
i
thought
you
looked
lonesome
i
so
glad
you
stopped
now
we
introduced
only
i
do
know
your
name
well
of
all
the
the
man
did
not
finish
his
sentence
but
strode
on
faster
than
ever
pollyanna
looked
after
him
with
a
disappointed
droop
to
her
usually
smiling
lips
maybe
he
did
understand
but
that
was
only
half
an
introduction
i
do
know
his
name
yet
she
murmured
as
she
proceeded
on
her
way
pollyanna
was
carrying
jelly
to
mrs
snow
miss
polly
harrington
always
sent
something
to
mrs
snow
once
a
week
she
said
she
thought
that
it
was
her
duty
inasmuch
as
mrs
snow
was
poor
sick
and
a
member
of
her
church
it
was
the
duty
of
all
the
church
members
to
look
out
for
her
of
course
miss
polly
did
her
duty
by
mrs
snow
usually
on
thursday
afternoons
not
personally
but
through
nancy
pollyanna
had
begged
the
privilege
and
nancy
had
promptly
given
it
to
her
in
accordance
with
miss
polly
orders
and
it
glad
that
i
am
ter
get
rid
of
it
nancy
had
declared
in
private
afterwards
to
pollyanna
though
it
a
shame
ter
be
tuckin
the
job
off
on
ter
you
poor
lamb
so
it
is
it
is
but
i
love
to
do
it
well
you
wo
after
you
done
it
once
predicted
nancy
sourly
why
not
because
nobody
does
if
folks
sorry
for
her
there
would
a
soul
go
near
her
from
mornin
till
night
she
that
cantankerous
all
is
i
pity
her
daughter
what
has
ter
take
care
of
but
why
nancy
nancy
shrugged
her
shoulders
well
in
plain
words
it
just
that
nothin
what
ever
has
happened
has
happened
right
in
mis
snow
eyes
even
the
days
of
the
week
run
ter
her
mind
if
it
monday
she
bound
ter
say
she
wished
was
sunday
and
if
you
take
her
jelly
you
pretty
sure
ter
hear
she
wanted
chicken
but
if
you
did
bring
her
chicken
she
be
jest
hankerin
for
lamb
broth
why
what
a
funny
woman
laughed
pollyanna
i
think
i
shall
like
to
go
to
see
her
she
must
be
so
surprising
and
and
different
i
love
different
humph
well
mis
snow
all
right
i
hope
for
the
sake
of
the
rest
of
us
nancy
had
finished
grimly
pollyanna
was
thinking
of
these
remarks
as
she
turned
in
at
the
gate
of
the
shabby
little
cottage
her
eyes
were
quite
sparkling
indeed
at
the
prospect
of
meeting
this
different
mrs
snow
a
young
girl
answered
her
knock
at
the
door
how
do
you
do
began
pollyanna
politely
i
from
miss
polly
harrington
and
i
like
to
see
mrs
snow
well
if
you
would
you
the
first
one
that
ever
to
see
her
muttered
the
girl
under
her
breath
but
pollyanna
did
not
hear
this
the
girl
had
turned
and
was
leading
the
way
through
the
hall
to
a
door
at
the
end
of
it
in
the
after
the
girl
had
ushered
her
in
and
closed
the
door
pollyanna
blinked
a
little
before
she
could
accustom
her
eyes
to
the
gloom
then
she
saw
dimly
outlined
a
woman
up
in
the
bed
across
the
room
pollyanna
advanced
at
once
how
do
you
do
mrs
snow
aunt
polly
says
she
hopes
you
are
comfortable
and
she
sent
you
some
dear
me
jelly
murmured
a
fretful
voice
of
course
i
very
much
obliged
but
i
was
hoping
be
lamb
broth
pollyanna
frowned
a
little
why
i
thought
it
was
chicken
you
wanted
when
folks
brought
you
jelly
she
said
what
the
sick
woman
turned
sharply
why
nothing
much
apologized
pollyanna
hurriedly
and
of
course
it
does
really
make
any
difference
it
only
that
nancy
said
it
was
chicken
you
wanted
when
we
brought
jelly
and
lamb
broth
when
we
brought
chicken
but
maybe
was
the
other
way
and
nancy
the
sick
woman
pulled
herself
up
till
she
sat
erect
in
the
bed
a
most
unusual
thing
for
her
to
do
though
pollyanna
did
not
know
this
well
miss
impertinence
who
are
you
she
demanded
pollyanna
laughed
gleefully
oh
that
is
my
name
mrs
snow
and
i
so
glad
is
too
that
would
be
worse
than
would
it
i
pollyanna
whittier
miss
polly
harrington
niece
and
i
come
to
live
with
her
why
i
here
with
the
jelly
this
all
through
the
first
part
of
this
sentence
the
sick
woman
had
sat
interestedly
erect
but
at
the
reference
to
the
jelly
she
fell
back
on
her
pillow
listlessly
very
well
thank
you
your
aunt
is
very
kind
of
course
but
my
appetite
is
very
good
this
morning
and
i
was
wanting
lamb
she
stopped
suddenly
then
went
on
with
an
abrupt
change
of
subject
i
never
slept
a
wink
last
night
not
a
wink
o
dear
i
wish
did
sighed
pollyanna
placing
the
jelly
on
the
little
stand
and
seating
herself
comfortably
in
the
nearest
chair
you
lose
such
a
lot
of
time
just
sleeping
do
you
think
so
lose
time
sleeping
exclaimed
the
sick
woman
yes
when
you
might
be
just
living
you
know
it
seems
such
a
pity
we
ca
live
nights
once
again
the
woman
pulled
herself
erect
in
her
bed
well
if
you
ai
the
amazing
young
one
she
cried
here
do
you
go
to
that
window
and
pull
up
the
curtain
she
directed
i
should
like
to
know
what
you
look
like
pollyanna
rose
to
her
feet
but
she
laughed
a
little
ruefully
o
dear
then
you
see
my
freckles
wo
you
she
sighed
as
she
went
to
the
window
and
just
when
i
was
being
so
glad
it
was
dark
and
you
could
see
there
now
you
can
oh
she
broke
off
excitedly
as
she
turned
back
to
the
bed
i
so
glad
you
wanted
to
see
me
because
now
i
can
see
you
they
did
tell
me
you
were
so
pretty
me
pretty
scoffed
the
woman
bitterly
why
yes
did
you
know
it
cried
pollyanna
well
no
i
did
retorted
mrs
snow
dryly
mrs
snow
had
lived
forty
years
and
for
fifteen
of
those
years
she
had
been
too
busy
wishing
things
were
different
to
find
much
time
to
enjoy
things
as
they
were
oh
but
your
eyes
are
so
big
and
dark
and
your
hair
all
dark
too
and
curly
cooed
pollyanna
i
love
black
curls
that
one
of
the
things
i
going
to
have
when
i
get
to
heaven
and
you
got
two
little
red
spots
in
your
cheeks
why
mrs
snow
you
are
pretty
i
should
think
you
know
it
when
you
looked
at
yourself
in
the
the
glass
snapped
the
sick
woman
falling
back
on
her
pillow
yes
well
i
hai
done
much
prinkin
before
the
mirror
these
days
and
you
would
if
you
was
flat
on
your
back
as
i
am
why
no
of
course
not
agreed
pollyanna
sympathetically
but
wait
just
let
me
show
you
she
exclaimed
skipping
over
to
the
bureau
and
picking
up
a
small
on
the
way
back
to
the
bed
she
stopped
eyeing
the
sick
woman
with
a
critical
gaze
i
reckon
maybe
if
you
do
mind
i
like
to
fix
your
hair
just
a
little
before
i
let
you
see
it
she
proposed
may
i
fix
your
hair
please
why
i
suppose
so
if
you
want
to
permitted
mrs
snow
grudgingly
but
stay
you
oh
thank
you
i
love
to
fix
people
hair
exulted
pollyanna
carefully
laying
down
the
and
reaching
for
a
comb
i
do
much
of
course
i
in
such
a
hurry
for
you
to
see
how
pretty
you
are
but
some
day
i
going
to
take
it
all
down
and
have
a
perfectly
lovely
time
with
it
she
cried
touching
with
soft
fingers
the
waving
hair
above
the
sick
woman
forehead
for
five
minutes
pollyanna
worked
swiftly
deftly
combing
a
refractory
curl
into
fluffiness
perking
up
a
drooping
ruffle
at
the
neck
or
shaking
a
pillow
into
plumpness
so
that
the
head
might
have
a
better
pose
meanwhile
the
sick
woman
frowning
prodigiously
and
openly
scoffing
at
the
whole
procedure
was
in
spite
of
herself
beginning
to
tingle
with
a
feeling
perilously
near
to
excitement
there
panted
pollyanna
hastily
plucking
a
pink
from
a
vase
near
by
and
tucking
it
into
the
dark
hair
where
it
would
give
the
best
effect
now
i
reckon
we
ready
to
be
looked
at
and
she
held
out
the
mirror
in
triumph
humph
grunted
the
sick
woman
eyeing
her
reflection
severely
i
like
red
pinks
better
than
pink
ones
but
then
it
fade
anyhow
before
night
so
what
the
difference
but
i
should
think
you
be
glad
they
did
fade
laughed
pollyanna
then
you
can
have
the
fun
of
getting
some
more
i
just
love
your
hair
fluffed
out
like
that
she
finished
with
a
satisfied
gaze
you
maybe
still
last
with
me
tossing
back
and
forth
on
the
pillow
as
i
of
course
not
and
i
glad
too
nodded
pollyanna
cheerfully
because
then
i
can
fix
it
again
anyhow
i
should
think
you
be
glad
it
black
black
shows
up
so
much
nicer
on
a
pillow
than
yellow
hair
like
mine
maybe
but
i
never
did
set
much
store
by
black
hair
shows
gray
too
soon
retorted
mrs
snow
she
spoke
fretfully
but
she
still
held
the
mirror
before
her
face
oh
i
love
black
hair
i
should
be
so
glad
if
i
only
had
it
sighed
pollyanna
mrs
snow
dropped
the
mirror
and
turned
irritably
well
you
would
not
if
you
were
me
you
would
be
glad
for
black
hair
nor
anything
else
if
you
had
to
lie
here
all
day
as
i
do
pollyanna
bent
her
brows
in
a
thoughtful
frown
why
be
kind
of
hard
to
do
it
then
would
it
she
mused
aloud
do
what
be
glad
about
be
glad
about
things
when
you
sick
in
bed
all
your
days
well
i
should
say
it
would
retorted
mrs
snow
if
you
do
think
so
just
tell
me
something
to
be
glad
about
that
all
to
mrs
snow
unbounded
amazement
pollyanna
sprang
to
her
feet
and
clapped
her
hands
oh
goody
that
be
a
hard
one
wo
it
i
got
to
go
now
but
i
think
and
think
all
the
way
home
and
maybe
the
next
time
i
come
i
can
tell
it
to
you
i
had
a
lovely
time
she
called
again
as
she
tripped
through
the
doorway
well
i
never
now
what
does
she
mean
by
that
ejaculated
mrs
snow
staring
after
her
visitor
by
and
by
she
turned
her
head
and
picked
up
the
mirror
eyeing
her
reflection
critically
that
little
thing
has
got
a
knack
with
hair
and
no
mistake
she
muttered
under
her
breath
i
declare
i
did
know
it
could
look
so
pretty
but
then
what
the
use
she
sighed
dropping
the
little
glass
into
the
bedclothes
and
rolling
her
head
on
the
pillow
fretfully
a
little
later
when
milly
mrs
snow
daughter
came
in
the
mirror
still
lay
among
the
bedclothes
thought
it
had
been
carefully
hidden
from
sight
why
mother
the
curtain
is
up
cried
milly
dividing
her
amazed
stare
between
the
window
and
the
pink
in
her
mother
hair
well
what
if
it
is
snapped
the
sick
woman
i
need
stay
in
the
dark
all
my
life
if
i
am
sick
need
i
why
of
course
not
rejoined
milly
in
hasty
conciliation
as
she
reached
for
the
medicine
bottle
it
only
well
you
know
very
well
that
i
tried
to
get
you
to
have
a
lighter
room
for
ages
and
you
there
was
no
reply
to
this
mrs
snow
was
picking
at
the
lace
on
her
nightgown
at
last
she
spoke
fretfully
i
should
think
somebody
might
give
me
a
new
nightdress
instead
of
lamb
broth
for
a
change
why
mother
no
wonder
milly
quite
gasped
aloud
with
bewilderment
in
the
drawer
behind
her
at
that
moment
lay
two
new
nightdresses
that
milly
for
months
had
been
vainly
urging
her
mother
to
wear
chapter
ix
which
tells
of
the
man
it
rained
the
next
time
pollyanna
saw
the
man
she
greeted
him
however
with
a
bright
smile
it
is
so
nice
is
it
she
called
blithesomely
i
glad
it
does
rain
always
anyhow
the
man
did
not
even
grunt
this
time
nor
turn
his
head
pollyanna
decided
that
of
course
he
did
not
hear
her
the
next
time
therefore
which
happened
to
be
the
following
day
she
spoke
up
louder
she
thought
it
particularly
necessary
to
do
this
anyway
for
the
man
was
striding
along
his
hands
behind
his
back
and
his
eyes
on
the
ground
which
seemed
to
pollyanna
preposterous
in
the
face
of
the
glorious
sunshine
and
the
morning
air
pollyanna
as
a
special
treat
was
on
a
morning
errand
how
do
you
do
she
chirped
i
so
glad
it
is
yesterday
you
the
man
stopped
abruptly
there
was
an
angry
scowl
on
his
face
see
here
little
girl
we
might
just
as
well
settle
this
thing
right
now
once
for
all
he
began
testily
i
got
something
besides
the
weather
to
think
of
i
do
know
whether
the
sun
shines
or
pollyanna
beamed
joyously
no
sir
i
thought
you
did
that
why
i
told
yes
well
eh
what
he
broke
off
sharply
in
sudden
understanding
of
her
words
i
say
that
why
i
told
you
so
you
would
notice
it
you
know
that
the
sun
shines
and
all
that
i
knew
you
be
glad
it
did
if
you
only
stopped
to
think
of
it
and
you
did
look
a
bit
as
if
you
were
thinking
of
it
well
of
all
the
ejaculated
the
man
with
an
oddly
impotent
gesture
he
started
forward
again
but
after
the
second
step
he
turned
back
still
frowning
see
here
why
do
you
find
some
one
your
own
age
to
talk
to
i
like
to
sir
but
there
are
any
here
nancy
says
still
i
do
mind
so
very
much
i
like
old
folks
just
as
well
maybe
better
sometimes
being
used
to
the
ladies
aid
humph
the
ladies
aid
indeed
is
that
what
you
took
me
for
the
man
lips
were
threatening
to
smile
but
the
scowl
above
them
was
still
trying
to
hold
them
grimly
stern
pollyanna
laughed
gleefully
oh
no
sir
you
do
look
a
mite
like
a
ladies
aider
not
but
that
you
just
as
good
of
course
maybe
better
she
added
in
hurried
politeness
you
see
i
sure
you
much
nicer
than
you
look
the
man
made
a
queer
noise
in
his
throat
well
of
all
the
he
ejaculated
again
as
he
turned
and
strode
on
as
before
the
next
time
pollyanna
met
the
man
his
eyes
were
gazing
straight
into
hers
with
a
quizzical
directness
that
made
his
face
look
really
pleasant
pollyanna
thought
good
afternoon
he
greeted
her
a
little
stiffly
perhaps
i
better
say
right
away
that
i
know
the
sun
is
shining
but
you
do
have
to
tell
me
nodded
pollyanna
brightly
i
knew
you
knew
it
just
as
soon
as
i
saw
oh
you
did
did
you
yes
sir
i
saw
it
in
your
eyes
you
know
and
in
your
humph
grunted
the
man
as
he
passed
on
the
man
always
spoke
to
pollyanna
after
this
and
frequently
he
spoke
first
though
usually
he
said
little
but
good
even
that
however
was
a
great
surprise
to
nancy
who
chanced
to
be
with
pollyanna
one
day
when
the
greeting
was
given
sakes
alive
miss
pollyanna
she
gasped
did
that
man
speak
to
you
why
yes
he
always
does
now
smiled
pollyanna
always
does
goodness
do
you
know
who
he
is
demanded
nancy
pollyanna
frowned
and
shook
her
head
i
reckon
he
forgot
to
tell
me
one
day
you
see
i
did
my
part
of
the
introducing
but
he
nancy
eyes
widened
but
he
never
speaks
ter
anybody
child
he
hai
for
years
i
guess
except
when
he
just
has
to
for
business
and
all
that
he
john
pendleton
he
lives
all
by
himself
in
the
big
house
on
pendleton
hill
he
wo
even
have
any
one
ter
cook
for
him
comes
down
ter
the
hotel
for
his
meals
three
times
a
day
i
know
sally
miner
who
waits
on
him
and
she
says
he
hardly
opens
his
head
enough
ter
tell
what
he
wants
ter
eat
she
has
ter
guess
it
half
the
time
only
it
be
somethin
cheap
she
knows
that
without
no
pollyanna
nodded
sympathetically
i
know
you
have
to
look
for
cheap
things
when
you
poor
father
and
i
took
meals
out
a
lot
we
had
beans
and
fish
balls
most
generally
we
used
to
say
how
glad
we
were
we
liked
beans
that
is
we
said
it
specially
when
we
were
looking
at
the
roast
turkey
place
you
know
that
was
sixty
cents
does
pendleton
like
beans
like
what
if
he
does
or
do
why
miss
pollyanna
he
poor
he
got
loads
of
money
john
pendleton
has
from
his
father
there
ai
nobody
in
town
as
rich
as
he
is
he
could
eat
dollar
bills
if
he
wanted
to
and
not
know
pollyanna
giggled
as
if
anybody
could
eat
dollar
bills
and
not
know
it
nancy
when
they
come
to
try
to
chew
ho
i
mean
he
rich
enough
ter
do
it
shrugged
nancy
he
spendin
his
money
that
all
he
of
oh
for
the
heathen
surmised
pollyanna
how
perfectly
splendid
that
denying
yourself
and
taking
up
your
cross
i
know
father
told
nancy
lips
parted
abruptly
as
if
there
were
angry
words
all
ready
to
come
but
her
eyes
resting
on
pollyanna
jubilantly
trustful
face
saw
something
that
prevented
the
words
being
spoken
humph
she
vouchsafed
then
showing
her
interest
she
went
on
but
say
it
is
queer
his
speakin
to
you
honestly
miss
pollyanna
he
do
speak
ter
no
one
and
he
lives
all
alone
in
a
great
big
lovely
house
all
full
of
jest
grand
things
they
say
some
says
crazy
and
some
jest
cross
and
some
says
he
got
a
skeleton
in
his
oh
nancy
shuddered
pollyanna
how
can
he
keep
such
a
dreadful
thing
i
should
think
he
throw
it
away
nancy
chuckled
that
pollyanna
had
taken
the
skeleton
literally
instead
of
figuratively
she
knew
very
well
but
perversely
she
refrained
from
correcting
the
mistake
and
everybody
says
he
mysterious
she
went
on
some
years
he
jest
travels
week
in
and
week
out
and
it
always
in
heathen
countries
egypt
and
asia
and
the
desert
of
sarah
you
oh
a
missionary
nodded
pollyanna
nancy
laughed
oddly
well
i
did
say
that
miss
pollyanna
when
he
comes
back
he
writes
books
queer
odd
books
they
say
about
some
gimcrack
he
found
in
them
heathen
countries
but
he
do
never
seem
ter
want
ter
spend
no
money
here
leastways
not
for
jest
of
course
not
if
he
saving
it
for
the
heathen
declared
pollyanna
but
he
is
a
funny
man
and
he
different
too
just
like
mrs
snow
only
he
a
different
well
i
guess
he
is
rather
chuckled
nancy
i
ever
now
anyhow
that
he
speaks
to
me
sighed
pollyanna
contentedly
chapter
x
a
surprise
for
mrs
snow
the
next
time
pollyanna
went
to
see
mrs
snow
she
found
that
lady
as
at
first
in
a
darkened
room
it
the
little
girl
from
miss
polly
mother
announced
milly
in
a
tired
manner
then
pollyanna
found
herself
alone
with
the
invalid
oh
it
you
is
it
asked
a
fretful
voice
from
the
bed
i
remember
you
anybody
remember
you
i
guess
if
they
saw
you
once
i
wish
you
had
come
yesterday
i
wanted
you
did
you
well
i
glad
is
any
farther
away
from
yesterday
than
is
then
laughed
pollyanna
advancing
cheerily
into
the
room
and
setting
her
basket
carefully
down
on
a
chair
my
but
are
you
dark
here
though
i
ca
see
you
a
bit
she
cried
unhesitatingly
crossing
to
the
window
and
pulling
up
the
shade
i
want
to
see
if
you
fixed
your
hair
like
i
did
oh
you
have
but
never
mind
glad
you
have
after
all
maybe
you
let
me
do
it
later
but
now
i
want
you
to
see
what
i
brought
the
woman
stirred
restlessly
just
as
if
how
it
looks
would
make
any
difference
in
how
it
tastes
she
scoffed
but
she
turned
her
eyes
toward
the
basket
well
what
is
it
guess
what
do
you
want
pollyanna
had
skipped
back
to
the
basket
her
face
was
alight
the
sick
woman
frowned
why
i
do
want
anything
as
i
know
of
she
sighed
after
all
they
all
taste
alike
pollyanna
chuckled
this
wo
guess
if
you
did
want
something
what
would
it
be
the
woman
hesitated
she
did
not
realize
it
herself
but
she
had
so
long
been
accustomed
to
wanting
what
she
did
not
have
that
to
state
what
she
did
want
seemed
impossible
until
she
knew
what
she
had
obviously
however
she
must
say
something
this
extraordinary
child
was
waiting
well
of
course
there
lamb
broth
i
got
it
crowed
pollyanna
but
that
what
i
did
want
sighed
the
sick
woman
sure
now
of
what
her
stomach
craved
it
was
chicken
i
oh
i
got
that
too
chuckled
pollyanna
the
woman
turned
in
amazement
both
of
them
she
demanded
yes
and
jelly
triumphed
pollyanna
i
was
just
bound
you
should
have
what
you
wanted
for
once
so
nancy
and
i
fixed
it
oh
of
course
there
only
a
little
of
each
but
there
some
of
all
of
i
so
glad
you
did
want
chicken
she
went
on
contentedly
as
she
lifted
the
three
little
bowls
from
her
basket
you
see
i
got
to
thinking
on
the
way
here
what
if
you
should
say
tripe
or
onions
or
something
like
that
that
i
did
have
would
it
have
been
a
shame
when
i
tried
so
hard
she
laughed
merrily
there
was
no
reply
the
sick
woman
seemed
to
be
trying
mentally
to
find
something
she
had
lost
there
i
to
leave
them
all
announced
pollyanna
as
she
arranged
the
three
bowls
in
a
row
on
the
table
like
enough
it
be
lamb
broth
you
want
how
do
you
do
she
finished
in
polite
inquiry
very
poorly
thank
you
murmured
mrs
snow
falling
back
into
her
usual
listless
attitude
i
lost
my
nap
this
morning
nellie
higgins
next
door
has
begun
music
lessons
and
her
practising
drives
me
nearly
wild
she
was
at
it
all
the
morning
every
minute
i
sure
i
know
what
i
shall
do
polly
nodded
sympathetically
i
know
it
is
awful
white
had
it
once
one
of
my
ladies
aiders
you
know
she
had
rheumatic
fever
too
at
the
same
time
so
she
could
thrash
she
said
have
been
easier
if
she
could
have
can
you
can
i
what
thrash
move
you
know
so
as
to
change
your
position
when
the
music
gets
too
hard
to
mrs
snow
stared
a
little
why
of
course
i
can
move
anywhere
in
bed
she
rejoined
a
little
irritably
well
you
can
be
glad
of
that
then
anyhow
ca
you
nodded
pollyanna
mrs
white
could
you
ca
thrash
when
you
have
rheumatic
fever
though
you
want
to
something
awful
white
says
she
told
me
afterwards
she
reckoned
she
have
gone
raving
crazy
if
it
had
been
for
white
sister
ears
being
deaf
sister
ears
what
do
you
mean
pollyanna
laughed
well
i
reckon
i
did
tell
it
all
and
i
forgot
you
did
know
white
you
see
miss
white
was
deaf
awfully
deaf
and
she
came
to
visit
and
to
help
take
care
of
white
and
the
house
well
they
had
such
an
awful
time
making
her
understand
anything
that
after
that
every
time
the
piano
commenced
to
play
across
the
street
white
felt
so
glad
she
could
hear
it
that
she
did
mind
so
much
that
she
did
hear
it
she
could
help
thinking
how
awful
be
if
she
was
deaf
and
could
hear
anything
like
her
husband
sister
you
see
she
was
playing
the
game
too
i
told
her
about
the
game
pollyanna
clapped
her
hands
there
i
forgot
but
i
thought
it
up
mrs
snow
what
you
can
be
glad
glad
about
what
do
you
mean
why
i
told
you
i
would
do
you
remember
you
asked
me
to
tell
you
something
to
be
glad
about
glad
you
know
even
though
you
did
have
to
lie
here
abed
all
oh
scoffed
the
woman
that
yes
i
remember
that
but
i
suppose
you
were
in
earnest
any
more
than
i
oh
yes
i
was
nodded
pollyanna
triumphantly
and
i
found
it
too
but
was
hard
it
all
the
more
fun
though
always
when
is
hard
and
i
will
own
up
honest
to
true
that
i
could
think
of
anything
for
a
while
then
i
got
did
you
really
well
what
is
it
mrs
snow
voice
was
sarcastically
polite
pollyanna
drew
a
long
breath
i
thought
how
glad
you
could
be
that
other
folks
were
like
you
all
sick
in
bed
like
this
you
know
she
announced
impressively
mrs
snow
stared
her
eyes
were
angry
well
really
she
ejaculated
then
in
not
quite
an
agreeable
tone
of
voice
and
now
i
tell
you
the
game
proposed
pollyanna
blithely
confident
it
be
just
lovely
for
you
to
play
it
be
so
hard
and
there
so
much
more
fun
when
it
is
hard
you
see
it
like
and
she
began
to
tell
of
the
missionary
barrel
the
crutches
and
the
doll
that
did
not
come
the
story
was
just
finished
when
milly
appeared
at
the
door
your
aunt
is
wanting
you
miss
pollyanna
she
said
with
dreary
listlessness
she
telephoned
down
to
the
harlows
across
the
way
she
says
you
to
hurry
that
you
got
some
practising
to
make
up
before
pollyanna
rose
reluctantly
all
right
she
sighed
i
suddenly
she
laughed
i
suppose
i
ought
to
be
glad
i
got
legs
to
hurry
with
had
i
mrs
snow
there
was
no
answer
mrs
snow
eyes
were
closed
but
milly
whose
eyes
were
wide
open
with
surprise
saw
that
there
were
tears
on
the
wasted
cheeks
flung
pollyanna
over
her
shoulder
as
she
reached
the
door
i
awfully
sorry
about
the
hair
i
wanted
to
do
it
but
maybe
i
can
next
time
one
by
one
the
july
days
passed
to
pollyanna
they
were
happy
days
indeed
she
often
told
her
aunt
joyously
how
very
happy
they
were
whereupon
her
aunt
would
usually
reply
wearily
very
well
pollyanna
i
am
gratified
of
course
that
they
are
happy
but
i
trust
that
they
are
profitable
as
well
otherwise
i
should
have
failed
signally
in
my
generally
pollyanna
would
answer
this
with
a
hug
and
a
kiss
a
proceeding
that
was
still
always
most
disconcerting
to
miss
polly
but
one
day
she
spoke
it
was
during
the
sewing
hour
do
you
mean
that
it
would
be
enough
then
aunt
polly
that
they
should
be
just
happy
days
she
asked
wistfully
that
is
what
i
mean
they
must
be
as
well
what
is
being
why
it
it
just
being
profitable
having
profit
something
to
show
for
it
pollyanna
what
an
extraordinary
child
you
are
then
just
being
glad
is
questioned
pollyanna
a
little
anxiously
certainly
o
dear
then
you
would
like
it
of
course
i
afraid
now
you
wo
ever
play
the
game
aunt
game
what
game
why
that
father
pollyanna
clapped
her
hand
to
her
lips
she
stammered
miss
polly
frowned
that
will
do
for
this
morning
pollyanna
she
said
tersely
and
the
sewing
lesson
was
over
it
was
that
afternoon
that
pollyanna
coming
down
from
her
attic
room
met
her
aunt
on
the
stairway
why
aunt
polly
how
perfectly
lovely
she
cried
you
were
coming
up
to
see
me
come
right
in
i
love
company
she
finished
scampering
up
the
stairs
and
throwing
her
door
wide
open
now
miss
polly
had
not
been
intending
to
call
on
her
niece
she
had
been
planning
to
look
for
a
certain
white
wool
shawl
in
the
cedar
chest
near
the
east
window
but
to
her
unbounded
surprise
now
she
found
herself
not
in
the
main
attic
before
the
cedar
chest
but
in
pollyanna
little
room
sitting
in
one
of
the
chairs
so
many
many
times
since
pollyanna
came
miss
polly
had
found
herself
like
this
doing
some
utterly
unexpected
surprising
thing
quite
unlike
the
thing
she
had
set
out
to
do
i
love
company
said
pollyanna
again
flitting
about
as
if
she
were
dispensing
the
hospitality
of
a
palace
specially
since
i
had
this
room
all
mine
you
know
oh
of
course
i
had
a
room
always
but
was
a
hired
room
and
hired
rooms
are
half
as
nice
as
owned
ones
are
they
and
of
course
i
do
own
this
one
do
i
why
pollyanna
murmured
miss
polly
vaguely
wondering
why
she
did
not
get
up
at
once
and
go
to
look
for
that
shawl
and
of
course
now
i
just
love
this
room
even
if
it
has
got
the
carpets
and
curtains
and
pictures
that
i
been
want
with
a
painful
blush
pollyanna
stopped
short
she
was
plunging
into
an
entirely
different
sentence
when
her
aunt
interrupted
her
sharply
what
that
pollyanna
aunt
polly
truly
i
did
mean
to
say
probably
not
returned
miss
polly
coldly
but
you
did
say
it
so
suppose
we
have
the
rest
of
but
it
was
anything
only
that
i
been
kind
of
planning
on
pretty
carpets
and
lace
curtains
and
things
you
know
but
of
course
planning
on
them
interrupted
miss
polly
sharply
pollyanna
blushed
still
more
painfully
i
ought
not
to
have
of
course
aunt
polly
she
apologized
it
was
only
because
i
always
wanted
them
and
had
had
them
i
suppose
oh
we
had
two
rugs
in
the
barrels
but
they
were
little
you
know
and
one
had
ink
spots
and
the
other
holes
and
there
never
were
only
those
two
pictures
the
one
fath
i
mean
the
good
one
we
sold
and
the
bad
one
that
broke
of
course
if
it
had
been
for
all
that
i
should
have
wanted
them
so
pretty
things
i
mean
and
i
should
have
got
to
planning
all
through
the
hall
that
first
day
how
pretty
mine
would
be
here
and
and
but
truly
aunt
polly
it
was
but
just
a
minute
i
mean
a
few
minutes
before
i
was
being
glad
that
the
bureau
did
have
a
because
it
did
show
my
freckles
and
there
be
a
nicer
picture
than
the
one
out
my
window
there
and
you
been
so
good
to
me
that
miss
polly
rose
suddenly
to
her
feet
her
face
was
very
red
that
will
do
pollyanna
she
said
stiffly
you
have
said
quite
enough
i
the
next
minute
she
had
swept
down
the
stairs
and
not
until
she
reached
the
first
floor
did
it
suddenly
occur
to
her
that
she
had
gone
up
into
the
attic
to
find
a
white
wool
shawl
in
the
cedar
chest
near
the
east
window
less
than
hours
later
miss
polly
said
to
nancy
crisply
nancy
you
may
move
miss
pollyanna
things
this
morning
to
the
room
directly
beneath
i
have
decided
to
have
my
niece
sleep
there
for
the
yes
said
nancy
aloud
o
glory
said
nancy
to
herself
to
pollyanna
a
minute
later
she
cried
joyously
and
wo
ye

listenin
ter
this
miss
pollyanna
you
ter
sleep
in
the
room
straight

white

why

truly
i
guess

really
and
truly
prophesied
nancy
exultingly
nodding
her
head
to
pollyanna
over
the
armful
of
dresses
she
had
taken
from
the
closet
i
told
ter
take
down
yer
things
and
goin
ter
take
too
she
gets
a
chance
ter
change
her
pollyanna
did
not
stop
to
hear
the
end
of
this
sentence
at
the
imminent
risk
of
being
dashed
headlong
she
was
flying
two
steps
at
a
time
bang
went
two
doors
and
a
chair
before
pollyanna
at
last
reached
her
goal
aunt
polly
oh
aunt
polly
aunt
polly
did
you
mean
it
really
why
that
got
everything
the
carpet
and
curtains
and
three
pictures
besides
the
one
outdoors
too

windows
look
the
same
way
oh
aunt
polly
very
well
pollyanna
i
am
gratified
that
you
like
the
change
of
course
but
if
you
think
so
much
of
all
those
things
i
trust
you
will
take
proper
care
of
them
that
all
pollyanna
please
pick
up
that
chair
and
you
have
banged
two
doors
in
the
last
miss
polly
spoke
sternly
all
the
more
sternly
because
for
some
inexplicable
reason
she
felt
inclined
to
cry
and
miss
polly
was
not
used
to
feeling
inclined
to
cry
pollyanna
picked
up
the
chair
yes
i
know
i
banged
those
doors
she
admitted
cheerfully
you
see
i
just
found
out
about
the
room
and
i
reckon
you
have
banged
doors
if
pollyanna
stopped
short
and
eyed
her
aunt
with
new
interest
aunt
polly
did
you
ever
bang
doors
i
hope
not
pollyanna
miss
polly
voice
was
properly
shocked
why
aunt
polly
what
a
shame
pollyanna
face
expressed
only
concerned
sympathy
a
shame
repeated
aunt
polly
too
dazed
to
say
more
why
yes
you
see
if
you
felt
like
banging
doors
you
have
banged
of
course
and
if
you
did
that
must
have
meant
that
you
ever
glad
over
anything
or
you
would
have
banged
you
could
have
helped
it
and
i
so
sorry
you
were
ever
glad
over
anything
pollyanna
gasped
the
lady
but
pollyanna
was
gone
and
only
the
distant
bang
of
the
door
answered
for
her
pollyanna
had
gone
to
help
nancy
bring
down
her
miss
polly
in
the
sitting
room
felt
vaguely
disturbed
but
then
of
course
she
had
been
glad
over
some
things
chapter
xi
introducing
jimmy
august
came
august
brought
several
surprises
and
some
changes
none
of
which
however
were
really
a
surprise
to
nancy
nancy
since
pollyanna
arrival
had
come
to
look
for
surprises
and
changes
first
there
was
the
kitten
pollyanna
found
the
kitten
mewing
pitifully
some
distance
down
the
road
when
systematic
questioning
of
the
neighbors
failed
to
find
any
one
who
claimed
it
pollyanna
brought
it
home
at
once
as
a
matter
of
course
and
i
was
glad
i
did
find
any
one
who
owned
it
too
she
told
her
aunt
in
happy
confidence
i
wanted
to
bring
it
home
all
the
time
i
love
kitties
i
knew
you
be
glad
to
let
it
live
miss
polly
looked
at
the
forlorn
little
gray
bunch
of
neglected
misery
in
pollyanna
arms
and
shivered
miss
polly
did
not
care
for
cats
not
even
pretty
healthy
clean
ones
ugh
pollyanna
what
a
dirty
little
beast
and
it
sick
i
sure
and
all
mangy
and
i
know
it
poor
little
thing
crooned
pollyanna
tenderly
looking
into
the
little
creature
frightened
eyes
and
it
all
trembly
too
it
so
scared
you
see
it
does
know
yet
that
we
going
to
keep
it
of
no
nor
anybody
else
retorted
miss
polly
with
meaning
emphasis
oh
yes
they
do
nodded
pollyanna
entirely
misunderstanding
her
aunt
words
i
told
everybody
we
should
keep
it
if
i
did
find
where
it
belonged
i
knew
you
be
glad
to
have
it
poor
little
lonesome
thing
miss
polly
opened
her
lips
and
tried
to
speak
but
in
vain
the
curious
helpless
feeling
that
had
been
hers
so
often
since
pollyanna
arrival
had
her
now
fast
in
its
grip
of
course
i
knew
hurried
on
pollyanna
gratefully
that
you
let
a
dear
little
lonesome
kitty
go
hunting
for
a
home
when
you
just
taken
me
in
and
i
said
so
to
ford
when
she
asked
if
you
let
me
keep
it
why
i
had
the
ladies
aid
you
know
and
kitty
did
have
anybody
i
knew
you
feel
that
way
she
nodded
happily
as
she
ran
from
the
room
but
pollyanna
pollyanna
remonstrated
miss
polly
i
do
but
pollyanna
was
already
halfway
to
the
kitchen
calling
nancy
nancy
just
see
this
dear
little
kitty
that
aunt
polly
is
going
to
bring
up
along
with
me
and
aunt
polly
in
the
sitting
room
who
abhorred
cats
fell
back
in
her
chair
with
a
gasp
of
dismay
powerless
to
remonstrate
the
next
day
it
was
a
dog
even
dirtier
and
more
forlorn
perhaps
than
was
the
kitten
and
again
miss
polly
to
her
dumfounded
amazement
found
herself
figuring
as
a
kind
protector
and
an
angel
of
mercy
a
role
that
pollyanna
so
unhesitatingly
thrust
upon
her
as
a
matter
of
course
that
the
woman
who
abhorred
dogs
even
more
than
she
did
cats
if
possible
found
herself
as
before
powerless
to
remonstrate
when
in
less
than
a
week
however
pollyanna
brought
home
a
small
ragged
boy
and
confidently
claimed
the
same
protection
for
him
miss
polly
did
have
something
to
say
it
happened
after
this
wise
on
a
pleasant
thursday
morning
pollyanna
had
been
taking
jelly
again
to
mrs
snow
mrs
snow
and
pollyanna
were
the
best
of
friends
now
their
friendship
had
started
from
the
third
visit
pollyanna
had
made
the
one
after
she
had
told
mrs
snow
of
the
game
mrs
snow
herself
was
playing
the
game
now
with
pollyanna
to
be
sure
she
was
not
playing
it
very
well
she
had
been
sorry
for
everything
for
so
long
that
it
was
not
easy
to
be
glad
for
anything
now
but
under
cheery
instructions
and
merry
laughter
at
her
mistakes
she
was
learning
fast
even
to
pollyanna
huge
delight
she
had
said
that
she
was
glad
pollyanna
brought
jelly
because
that
was
just
what
she
had
been
wanting
she
did
not
know
that
milly
at
the
front
door
had
told
pollyanna
that
the
minister
wife
had
already
that
day
sent
over
a
great
bowlful
of
that
same
kind
of
jelly
pollyanna
was
thinking
of
this
now
when
suddenly
she
saw
the
boy
the
boy
was
sitting
in
a
disconsolate
little
heap
by
the
roadside
whittling
at
a
small
stick
hullo
smiled
pollyanna
engagingly
the
boy
glanced
up
but
he
looked
away
again
at
once
hullo
yourself
he
mumbled
pollyanna
laughed
now
you
do
look
as
if
you
be
glad
even
for
jelly
she
chuckled
stopping
before
him
the
boy
stirred
restlessly
gave
her
a
surprised
look
and
began
to
whittle
again
at
his
stick
with
the
dull
knife
in
his
hand
pollyanna
hesitated
then
dropped
herself
comfortably
down
on
the
grass
near
him
in
spite
of
pollyanna
brave
assertion
that
she
was
used
to
ladies
aiders
and
did
mind
she
had
sighed
at
times
for
some
companion
of
her
own
age
hence
her
determination
to
make
the
most
of
this
one
my
name
pollyanna
whittier
she
began
pleasantly
what
yours
again
the
boy
stirred
restlessly
he
even
almost
got
to
his
feet
but
he
settled
back
jimmy
bean
he
grunted
with
ungracious
indifference
good
now
we
introduced
i
glad
you
did
your
part
some
folks
do
you
know
i
live
at
miss
polly
harrington
house
where
do
you
live
nowhere
why
you
ca
do
that
everybody
lives
somewhere
asserted
pollyanna
well
i
do
just
now
i
huntin
up
a
new
oh
where
is
it
the
boy
regarded
her
with
scornful
eyes
silly
as
if
i
be
for
it
if
i
knew
pollyanna
tossed
her
head
a
little
this
was
not
a
nice
boy
and
she
did
not
like
to
be
called
still
he
was
somebody
besides
old
folks
where
did
you
live
before
she
queried
well
if
you
ai
the
for
askin
questions
sighed
the
boy
impatiently
i
have
to
be
retorted
pollyanna
calmly
else
i
could
find
out
a
thing
about
you
if
you
talk
more
i
would
talk
so
the
boy
gave
a
short
laugh
it
was
a
sheepish
laugh
and
not
quite
a
willing
one
but
his
face
looked
a
little
pleasanter
when
he
spoke
this
time
all
right
then
here
goes
i
jimmy
bean
and
i
ten
years
old
on
eleven
i
come
last
year
ter
live
at
the
orphans
home
but
got
so
many
kids
there
ai
much
room
for
me
an
i
never
wanted
anyhow
i
do
believe
so
i
quit
i
goin
ter
live
somewheres
else
but
i
hai
found
the
place
yet
i
like
a
home
jest
a
common
one
ye
know
with
a
mother
in
it
instead
of
a
matron
if
ye
has
a
home
ye
has
folks
an
i
hai
had
folks
since
dad
died
so
i
now
i
tried
four
houses
but
they
did
want
me
though
i
said
i
expected
ter
work
there
is
that
all
you
want
ter
know
the
boy
voice
had
broken
a
little
over
the
last
two
sentences
why
what
a
shame
sympathized
pollyanna
and
did
there
anybody
want
you
o
dear
i
know
just
how
you
feel
because
after
after
my
father
died
too
there
was
anybody
but
the
ladies
aid
for
me
until
aunt
polly
said
she
take
pollyanna
stopped
abruptly
the
dawning
of
a
wonderful
idea
began
to
show
in
her
face
oh
i
know
just
the
place
for
you
she
cried
aunt
polly
take
you
i
know
she
will
did
she
take
me
and
did
she
take
fluffy
and
buffy
when
they
did
have
any
one
to
love
them
or
any
place
to
go
and
they
only
cats
and
dogs
oh
come
i
know
aunt
polly
take
you
you
do
know
how
good
and
kind
she
is
jimmy
bean
thin
little
face
brightened
honest
injun
would
she
now
i
work
ye
know
an
i
real
strong
he
bared
a
small
bony
arm
of
course
she
would
why
my
aunt
polly
is
the
nicest
lady
in
the
world
now
that
my
mama
has
gone
to
be
a
heaven
angel
and
rooms
heaps
of
she
continued
springing
to
her
feet
and
tugging
at
his
arm
it
an
awful
big
house
maybe
though
she
added
a
little
anxiously
as
they
hurried
on
maybe
you
have
to
sleep
in
the
attic
room
i
did
at
first
but
there
screens
there
now
so
be
so
hot
and
the
flies
ca
get
in
either
to
bring
in
the
on
their
feet
did
you
know
about
that
it
perfectly
lovely
maybe
let
you
read
the
book
if
you
good
i
mean
if
you
bad
and
got
freckles
too
with
a
critical
glance
so
you
be
glad
there
is
any
and
the
outdoor
picture
is
nicer
than
any
could
be
so
you
wo
mind
sleeping
in
that
room
at
all
sure
panted
pollyanna
finding
suddenly
that
she
needed
the
rest
of
her
breath
for
purposes
other
than
talking
gorry
exclaimed
jimmy
bean
tersely
and
uncomprehendingly
but
admiringly
then
he
added
i
should
think
anybody
who
could
talk
like
that
runnin
would
need
ter
ask
no
questions
ter
fill
up
time
with
pollyanna
laughed
well
anyhow
you
can
be
glad
of
that
she
retorted
for
when
talking
you
do
have
to
when
the
house
was
reached
pollyanna
unhesitatingly
piloted
her
companion
straight
into
the
presence
of
her
amazed
aunt
oh
aunt
polly
she
triumphed
just
look
i
got
something
ever
so
much
nicer
even
than
fluffy
and
buffy
for
you
to
bring
up
it
a
real
live
boy
he
wo
mind
a
bit
sleeping
in
the
attic
at
first
you
know
and
he
says
he
work
but
i
shall
need
him
the
most
of
the
time
to
play
with
i
miss
polly
grew
white
then
very
red
she
did
not
quite
understand
but
she
thought
she
understood
enough
pollyanna
what
does
this
mean
who
is
this
dirty
little
boy
where
did
you
find
him
she
demanded
sharply
the
dirty
little
boy
fell
back
a
step
and
looked
toward
the
door
pollyanna
laughed
merrily
there
if
i
did
forget
to
tell
you
his
name
i
as
bad
as
the
man
and
he
is
dirty
too
is
he
i
mean
the
boy
is
just
like
fluffy
and
buffy
were
when
you
took
them
in
but
i
reckon
he
improve
all
right
by
washing
just
as
they
did
and
oh
i
forgot
again
she
broke
off
with
a
laugh
this
is
jimmy
bean
aunt
well
what
is
he
doing
here
why
aunt
polly
i
just
told
you
pollyanna
eyes
were
wide
with
surprise
he
for
you
i
brought
him
home
so
he
could
live
here
you
know
he
wants
a
home
and
folks
i
told
him
how
good
you
were
to
me
and
to
fluffy
and
buffy
and
that
i
knew
you
would
be
to
him
because
of
course
he
even
nicer
than
cats
and
miss
polly
dropped
back
in
her
chair
and
raised
a
shaking
hand
to
her
throat
the
old
helplessness
was
threatening
once
more
to
overcome
her
with
a
visible
struggle
however
miss
polly
pulled
herself
suddenly
erect
that
will
do
pollyanna
this
is
a
little
the
most
absurd
thing
done
yet
as
if
tramp
cats
and
mangy
dogs
were
bad
enough
but
you
must
needs
bring
home
ragged
little
beggars
from
the
street
who
there
was
a
sudden
stir
from
the
boy
his
eyes
flashed
and
his
chin
came
up
with
two
strides
of
his
sturdy
little
legs
he
confronted
miss
polly
fearlessly
i
ai
a
beggar
marm
an
i
do
want
nothin
o
you
i
was
ter
work
of
course
fur
my
board
an
keep
i
would
have
come
ter
your
old
house
anyhow
if
this
girl
had
made
me
me
how
you
was
so
good
an
kind
that
you
be
jest
dyin
ter
take
me
in
so
there
and
he
wheeled
about
and
stalked
from
the
room
with
a
dignity
that
would
have
been
absurd
had
it
not
been
so
pitiful
oh
aunt
polly
choked
pollyanna
why
i
thought
you
be
glad
to
have
him
here
i
sure
i
should
think
you
be
glad
miss
polly
raised
her
hand
with
a
peremptory
gesture
of
silence
miss
polly
nerves
had
snapped
at
last
the
good
and
kind
of
the
words
were
still
ringing
in
her
ears
and
the
old
helplessness
was
almost
upon
her
she
knew
yet
she
rallied
her
forces
with
the
last
atom
of
her
will
power
pollyanna
she
cried
sharply
will
you
stop
using
that
everlasting
word
it
from
morning
till
night
until
i
think
i
shall
grow
wild
from
sheer
amazement
pollyanna
jaw
dropped
why
aunt
polly
she
breathed
i
should
think
you
be
glad
to
have
me
gl
oh
she
broke
off
clapping
her
hand
to
her
lips
and
hurrying
blindly
from
the
room
before
the
boy
had
reached
the
end
of
the
driveway
pollyanna
overtook
him
boy
boy
jimmy
bean
i
want
you
to
know
how
how
sorry
i
am
she
panted
catching
him
with
a
detaining
hand
sorry
nothin
i
ai
blamin
you
retorted
the
boy
sullenly
but
i
ai
no
beggar
he
added
with
sudden
spirit
of
course
you
are
but
you
must
blame
auntie
appealed
pollyanna
probably
i
did
do
the
introducing
right
anyhow
and
i
reckon
i
did
tell
her
much
who
you
were
she
is
good
and
kind
really
she
always
been
but
i
probably
did
explain
it
right
i
do
wish
i
could
find
some
place
for
you
though
the
boy
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
half
turned
away
never
mind
i
guess
i
can
find
one
myself
i
ai
no
beggar
you
pollyanna
was
frowning
thoughtfully
of
a
sudden
she
turned
her
face
illumined
say
i
tell
you
what
i
will
do
the
ladies
aid
meets
this
afternoon
i
heard
aunt
polly
say
so
i
lay
your
case
before
them
that
what
father
always
did
when
he
wanted
anything
educating
the
heathen
and
new
carpets
you
the
boy
turned
fiercely
well
i
ai
a
heathen
or
a
new
carpet
besides
what
is
a
aid
pollyanna
stared
in
shocked
disapproval
why
jimmy
bean
wherever
have
you
been
brought
up
not
to
know
what
a
ladies
aid
is
oh
all
right
if
you
ai
tellin
grunted
the
boy
turning
and
beginning
to
walk
away
indifferently
pollyanna
sprang
to
his
side
at
once
it
it
why
it
just
a
lot
of
ladies
that
meet
and
sew
and
give
suppers
and
raise
money
and
and
talk
that
what
a
ladies
aid
is
they
awfully
kind
that
is
most
of
mine
was
back
home
i
seen
this
one
here
but
they
always
good
i
reckon
i
going
to
tell
them
about
you
this
again
the
boy
turned
fiercely
not
much
you
will
maybe
you
think
i
goin
ter
stand
an
hear
a
whole
lot
o
women
call
me
a
beggar
instead

i

this
time

on
pollyanna
quick
to
see
the
signs
of
relenting
in
the
boy
face
and
there
be
some
of
i
know
that
would
be
glad
to
give
you
a

work

slowly

pollyanna
with

eyes
but

just
a
common
home
and
folks
that

she
called
brightly
as
she
turned
back
toward
the
house
in
the
window
at
that
moment
miss
polly
who
had
been
watching
the
two
children
followed
with
sombre
eyes
the
boy
until
a
bend
of
the
road
hid
him
from
sight
then
she
sighed
turned
and
walked
listlesly
and
miss
polly
did
not
usually
move
listlessly
in
her
ears
still
was
the
boy
scornful
you
was
so
good
and
in
her
heart
was
a
curious
sense
of
desolation
as
of
something
lost
chapter
xii
before
the
ladies
aid
dinner
which
came
at
noon
in
the
harrington
homestead
was
a
silent
meal
on
the
day
of
the
ladies
aid
meeting
pollyanna
it
is
true
tried
to
talk
but
she
did
not
make
a
success
of
it
chiefly
because
four
times
she
was
obliged
to
break
off
a
glad
in
the
middle
of
it
much
to
her
blushing
discomfort
the
fifth
time
it
happened
miss
polly
moved
her
head
wearily
there
there
child
say
it
if
you
want
to
she
sighed
i
sure
rather
you
did
than
not
if
it
going
to
make
all
this
pollyanna
puckered
little
face
cleared
oh
thank
you
i
afraid
it
would
be
pretty
hard
not
to
say
it
you
see
i
played
it
so
you
what
demanded
aunt
polly
played
it
the
game
you
know
that
father
pollyanna
stopped
with
a
painful
blush
at
finding
herself
so
soon
again
on
forbidden
ground
aunt
polly
frowned
and
said
nothing
the
rest
of
the
meal
was
a
silent
one
pollyanna
was
not
sorry
to
hear
aunt
polly
tell
the
minister
wife
over
the
telephone
a
little
later
that
she
would
not
be
at
the
aid
meeting
that
afternoon
owing
to
a
headache
when
aunt
polly
went
to
her
room
and
closed
the
door
pollyanna
tried
to
be
sorry
for
the
headache
but
she
could
not
help
feeling
glad
that
her
aunt
was
not
to
be
present
that
afternoon
when
she
laid
the
case
of
jimmy
bean
before
the
ladies
aid
she
could
not
forget
that
aunt
polly
had
called
jimmy
bean
a
little
beggar
and
she
did
not
want
aunt
polly
to
call
him
that
before
the
ladies
aid
pollyanna
knew
that
the
ladies
aid
met
at
two
in
the
chapel
next
the
church
not
quite
half
a
mile
from
home
she
planned
her
going
therefore
so
that
she
should
get
there
a
little
before
three
i
want
them
all
to
be
there
she
said
to
herself
else
the
very
one
that
was
there
might
be
the
one
who
would
be
wanting
to
give
jimmy
bean
a
home
and
of
course
two
always
means
three
really
to
ladies
quietly
but
with
confident
courage
pollyanna
ascended
the
chapel
steps
pushed
open
the
door
and
entered
the
vestibule
a
soft
babel
of
feminine
chatter
and
laughter
came
from
the
main
room
hesitating
only
a
brief
moment
pollyanna
pushed
open
one
of
the
inner
doors
the
chatter
dropped
to
a
surprised
hush
pollyanna
advanced
a
little
timidly
now
that
the
time
had
come
she
felt
unwontedly
shy
after
all
these
faces
about
her
were
not
her
own
dear
ladies
aid
how
do
you
do
ladies
aiders
she
faltered
politely
i
pollyanna
whittier
i
i
reckon
some
of
you
know
me
maybe
anyway
i
do
you
only
i
do
know
you
all
together
this
the
silence
could
almost
be
felt
now
some
of
the
ladies
did
know
this
rather
extraordinary
niece
of
their
and
nearly
all
had
heard
of
her
but
not
one
of
them
could
think
of
anything
to
say
just
then
i
i
come
to
to
lay
the
case
before
you
stammered
pollyanna
after
a
moment
unconsciously
falling
into
her
father
familiar
phraseology
there
was
a
slight
rustle
did
did
your
aunt
send
you
my
dear
asked
ford
the
wife
pollyanna
colored
a
little
oh
no
i
came
all
by
myself
you
see
i
used
to
ladies
aiders
it
was
ladies
aiders
that
brought
me
up
with
somebody
tittered
hysterically
and
the
minister
wife
frowned
yes
dear
what
is
it
well
it
it
jimmy
bean
sighed
pollyanna
he
has
any
home
except
the
orphan
one
and
they
full
and
do
want
him
anyhow
he
thinks
so
he
wants
another
he
wants
one
of
the
common
kind
that
has
a
mother
instead
of
a
matron
in
it
folks
you
know
that
care
ten
years
old
going
on
eleven
i
thought
some
of
you
might
like
him
to
live
with
you
you
well
did
you
ever
murmured
a
voice
breaking
the
dazed
pause
that
followed
pollyanna
words
with
anxious
eyes
pollyanna
swept
the
circle
of
faces
about
her
oh
i
forgot
to
say
he
will
work
she
supplemented
eagerly
still
there
was
silence
then
coldly
one
or
two
women
began
to
question
her
after
a
time
they
all
had
the
story
and
began
to
talk
among
themselves
animatedly
not
quite
pleasantly
pollyanna
listened
with
growing
anxiety
some
of
what
was
said
she
could
not
understand
she
did
gather
after
a
time
however
that
there
was
no
woman
there
who
had
a
home
to
give
him
though
every
woman
seemed
to
think
that
some
of
the
others
might
take
him
as
there
were
several
who
had
no
little
boys
of
their
own
already
in
their
homes
but
there
was
no
one
who
agreed
herself
to
take
him
then
she
heard
the
wife
suggest
timidly
that
they
as
a
society
might
perhaps
assume
his
support
and
education
instead
of
sending
quite
so
much
money
this
year
to
the
little
boys
in
india
a
great
many
ladies
talked
then
and
several
of
them
talked
all
at
once
and
even
more
loudly
and
more
unpleasantly
than
before
it
seemed
that
their
society
was
famous
for
its
offering
to
hindu
missions
and
several
said
they
should
die
of
mortification
if
it
should
be
less
this
year
some
of
what
was
said
at
this
time
pollyanna
again
thought
she
could
not
have
understood
too
for
it
sounded
almost
as
if
they
did
not
care
at
all
what
the
money
did
so
long
as
the
sum
opposite
the
name
of
their
society
in
a
certain
report
headed
the
list
and
of
course
that
could
not
be
what
they
meant
at
all
but
it
was
all
very
confusing
and
not
quite
pleasant
so
that
pollyanna
was
glad
indeed
when
at
last
she
found
herself
outside
in
the
hushed
sweet
air
only
she
was
very
sorry
too
for
she
knew
it
was
not
going
to
be
easy
or
anything
but
sad
to
tell
jimmy
bean
that
the
ladies
aid
had
decided
that
they
would
rather
send
all
their
money
to
bring
up
the
little
india
boys
than
to
save
out
enough
to
bring
up
one
little
boy
in
their
own
town
for
which
they
would
not
get
a
bit
of
credit
in
the
report
according
to
the
tall
lady
who
wore
spectacles
not
but
that
it
good
of
course
to
send
money
to
the
heathen
and
i
should
want
not
to
send
some
there
sighed
pollyanna
to
herself
as
she
trudged
sorrowfully
along
but
they
acted
as
if
little
boys
here
were
any
account
only
little
boys
off
i
should
think
though
they
rather
see
jimmy
bean
grow
than
just
a
report
chapter
xiii
in
pendleton
woods
pollyanna
had
not
turned
her
steps
toward
home
when
she
left
the
chapel
she
had
turned
them
instead
toward
pendleton
hill
it
had
been
a
hard
day
for
all
it
had
been
a
vacation
one
as
she
termed
the
infrequent
days
when
there
was
no
sewing
or
cooking
lesson
and
pollyanna
was
sure
that
nothing
would
do
her
quite
so
much
good
as
a
walk
through
the
green
quiet
of
pendleton
woods
up
pendleton
hill
therefore
she
climbed
steadily
in
spite
of
the
warm
sun
on
her
back
i
do
have
to
get
home
till
five
anyway
she
was
telling
herself
and
it
be
so
much
nicer
to
go
around
by
the
way
of
the
woods
even
if
i
do
have
to
climb
to
get
it
was
very
beautiful
in
the
pendleton
woods
as
pollyanna
knew
by
experience
but
it
seemed
even
more
delightful
than
ever
notwithstanding
her
disappointment
over
what
she
must
tell
jimmy
bean
i
wish
they
were
up
here
all
those
ladies
who
talked
so
loud
sighed
pollyanna
to
herself
raising
her
eyes
to
the
patches
of
vivid
blue
between
the
sunlit
green
of
the
anyhow
if
they
were
up
here
i
just
reckon
they
change
and
take
jimmy
bean
for
their
little
boy
all
right
she
finished
secure
in
her
conviction
but
unable
to
give
a
reason
for
it
even
to
herself
suddenly
pollyanna
lifted
her
head
and
listened
a
dog
had
barked
some
distance
ahead
a
moment
later
he
came
dashing
toward
her
still
barking
hullo
doggie
hullo
pollyanna
snapped
her
fingers
at
the
dog
and
looked
expectantly
down
the
path
she
had
seen
the
dog
once
before
she
was
sure
he
had
been
then
with
the
man
john
pendleton
she
was
looking
now
hoping
to
see
him
for
some
minutes
she
watched
eagerly
but
he
did
not
appear
then
she
turned
her
attention
toward
the
dog
the
dog
as
even
pollyanna
could
see
was
acting
strangely
he
was
still
barking
giving
little
short
sharp
yelps
as
if
of
alarm
he
was
running
back
and
forth
too
in
the
path
ahead
soon
they
reached
a
side
path
and
down
this
the
little
dog
fairly
flew
only
to
come
back
at
once
whining
and
barking
ho
that
is
the
way
home
laughed
pollyanna
still
keeping
to
the
main
path
the
little
dog
seemed
frantic
now
back
and
forth
back
and
forth
between
pollyanna
and
the
side
path
he
vibrated
barking
and
whining
pitifully
every
quiver
of
his
little
brown
body
and
every
glance
from
his
beseeching
brown
eyes
were
eloquent
with
appeal
so
eloquent
that
at
last
pollyanna
understood
turned
and
followed
him
straight
ahead
now
the
little
dog
dashed
madly
and
it
was
not
long
before
pollyanna
came
upon
the
reason
for
it
all
a
man
lying
motionless
at
the
foot
of
a
steep
overhanging
mass
of
rock
a
few
yards
from
the
side
path
a
twig
cracked
sharply
under
pollyanna
foot
and
the
man
turned
his
head
with
a
cry
of
dismay
pollyanna
ran
to
his
side
mr
pendleton
oh
are
you
hurt
hurt
oh
no
i
just
taking
a
siesta
in
the
sunshine
snapped
the
man
irritably
see
here
how
much
do
you
know
what
can
you
do
have
you
got
any
sense
pollyanna
caught
her
breath
with
a
little
gasp
but
as
was
her
habit
she
answered
the
questions
literally
one
by
one
why
pendleton
i
i
do
know
so
very
much
and
i
ca
do
a
great
many
things
but
most
of
the
ladies
aiders
except
rawson
said
i
had
real
good
sense
i
heard
say
so
one
day
they
did
know
i
heard
the
man
smiled
grimly
there
there
child
i
beg
your
pardon
i
sure
it
only
this
confounded
leg
of
mine
now
he
paused
and
with
some
difficulty
reached
his
hand
into
his
trousers
pocket
and
brought
out
a
bunch
of
keys
singling
out
one
between
his
thumb
and
forefinger
straight
through
the
path
there
about
five
minutes
walk
is
my
house
this
key
will
admit
you
to
the
side
door
under
the
do
you
know
what
a
is
oh
yes
sir
auntie
has
one
with
a
sun
parlor
over
it
that
the
roof
i
slept
on
only
i
did
sleep
you
know
they
found
eh
oh
well
when
you
get
into
the
house
go
straight
through
the
vestibule
and
hall
to
the
door
at
the
end
on
the
big
desk
in
the
middle
of
the
room
you
find
a
telephone
do
you
know
how
to
use
a
telephone
oh
yes
sir
why
once
when
aunt
polly
never
mind
aunt
polly
now
cut
in
the
man
scowlingly
as
he
tried
to
move
himself
a
little
hunt
up
thomas
chilton
number
on
the
card
you
find
somewhere
around
there
it
ought
to
be
on
the
hook
down
at
the
side
but
it
probably
wo
be
you
know
a
telephone
card
i
suppose
when
you
see
one
oh
yes
sir
i
just
love
aunt
polly
there
such
a
lot
of
queer
names
and
tell
chilton
that
john
pendleton
is
at
the
foot
of
little
eagle
ledge
in
pendleton
woods
with
a
broken
leg
and
to
come
at
once
with
a
stretcher
and
two
men
he
know
what
to
do
besides
that
tell
him
to
come
by
the
path
from
the
a
broken
leg
oh
pendleton
how
perfectly
awful
shuddered
pollyanna
but
i
so
glad
i
came
ca
do
yes
you
can
but
evidently
you
wo
will
you
go
and
do
what
i
ask
and
stop
talking
moaned
the
man
faintly
and
with
a
little
sobbing
cry
pollyanna
went
pollyanna
did
not
stop
now
to
look
up
at
the
patches
of
blue
between
the
sunlit
tops
of
the
trees
she
kept
her
eyes
on
the
ground
to
make
sure
that
no
twig
nor
stone
tripped
her
hurrying
feet
it
was
not
long
before
she
came
in
sight
of
the
house
she
had
seen
it
before
though
never
so
near
as
this
she
was
almost
frightened
now
at
the
massiveness
of
the
great
pile
of
gray
stone
with
its
pillared
verandas
and
its
imposing
entrance
pausing
only
a
moment
however
she
sped
across
the
big
neglected
lawn
and
around
the
house
to
the
side
door
under
the
her
fingers
stiff
from
their
tight
clutch
upon
the
keys
were
anything
but
skilful
in
their
efforts
to
turn
the
bolt
in
the
lock
but
at
last
the
heavy
carved
door
swung
slowly
back
on
its
hinges
pollyanna
caught
her
breath
in
spite
of
her
feeling
of
haste
she
paused
a
moment
and
looked
fearfully
through
the
vestibule
to
the
wide
sombre
hall
beyond
her
thoughts
in
a
whirl
this
was
john
house
the
house
of
mystery
the
house
into
which
no
one
but
its
master
entered
the
house
which
sheltered
somewhere
a
skeleton
yet
she
pollyanna
was
expected
to
enter
alone
these
fearsome
rooms
and
telephone
the
doctor
that
the
master
of
the
house
lay
now
with
a
little
cry
pollyanna
looking
neither
to
the
right
nor
the
left
fairly
ran
through
the
hall
to
the
door
at
the
end
and
opened
it
the
room
was
large
and
sombre
with
dark
woods
and
hangings
like
the
hall
but
through
the
west
window
the
sun
threw
a
long
shaft
of
gold
across
the
floor
gleamed
dully
on
the
tarnished
brass
andirons
in
the
fireplace
and
touched
the
nickel
of
the
telephone
on
the
great
desk
in
the
middle
of
the
room
it
was
toward
this
desk
that
pollyanna
hurriedly
tiptoed
the
telephone
card
was
not
on
its
hook
it
was
on
the
floor
but
pollyanna
found
it
and
ran
her
shaking
forefinger
down
through
the
to
in
due
time
she
had
chilton
himself
at
the
other
end
of
the
wires
and
was
tremblingly
delivering
her
message
and
answering
the
doctor
terse
pertinent
questions
this
done
she
hung
up
the
receiver
and
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
only
a
brief
glance
did
pollyanna
give
about
her
then
with
a
confused
vision
in
her
eyes
of
crimson
draperies
walls
a
littered
floor
an
untidy
desk
innumerable
closed
doors
any
one
of
which
might
conceal
a
skeleton
and
everywhere
dust
dust
dust
she
fled
back
through
the
hall
to
the
great
carved
door
still
half
open
as
she
had
left
it
in
what
seemed
even
to
the
injured
man
an
incredibly
short
time
pollyanna
was
back
in
the
woods
at
the
man
side
well
what
is
the
trouble
could
you
get
in
he
demanded
pollyanna
opened
wide
her
eyes
why
of
course
i
could
i
here
she
answered
as
if
i
be
here
if
i
had
got
in
and
the
doctor
will
be
right
up
just
as
soon
as
possible
with
the
men
and
things
he
said
he
knew
just
where
you
were
so
i
did
stay
to
show
him
i
wanted
to
be
with
did
you
smiled
the
man
grimly
well
i
ca
say
i
admire
your
taste
i
should
think
you
might
find
pleasanter
do
you
mean
because
you
so
cross
thanks
for
your
frankness
pollyanna
laughed
softly
but
you
only
cross
outside
you
ar
cross
inside
a
bit
indeed
how
do
you
know
that
asked
the
man
trying
to
change
the
position
of
his
head
without
moving
the
rest
of
his
body
oh
lots
of
ways
there
like
that
the
way
you
act
with
the
dog
she
added
pointing
to
the
long
slender
hand
that
rested
on
the
dog
sleek
head
near
him
it
funny
how
dogs
and
cats
know
the
insides
of
folks
better
than
other
folks
do
is
it
say
i
going
to
hold
your
head
she
finished
abruptly
the
man
winced
several
times
and
groaned
once
softly
while
the
change
was
being
made
but
in
the
end
he
found
pollyanna
lap
a
very
welcome
substitute
for
the
rocky
hollow
in
which
his
head
had
lain
before
well
that
is
better
he
murmured
faintly
he
did
not
speak
again
for
some
time
pollyanna
watching
his
face
wondered
if
he
were
asleep
she
did
not
think
he
was
he
looked
as
if
his
lips
were
tight
shut
to
keep
back
moans
of
pain
pollyanna
herself
almost
cried
aloud
as
she
looked
at
his
great
strong
body
lying
there
so
helpless
one
hand
with
fingers
tightly
clenched
lay
outflung
motionless
the
other
limply
open
lay
on
the
dog
head
the
dog
his
wistful
eager
eyes
on
his
master
face
was
motionless
too
minute
by
minute
the
time
passed
the
sun
dropped
lower
in
the
west
and
the
shadows
grew
deeper
under
the
trees
pollyanna
sat
so
still
she
hardly
seemed
to
breathe
a
bird
alighted
fearlessly
within
reach
of
her
hand
and
a
squirrel
whisked
his
bushy
tail
on
a
almost
under
her
nose
yet
with
his
bright
little
eyes
all
the
while
on
the
motionless
dog
at
last
the
dog
pricked
up
his
cars
and
whined
softly
then
he
gave
a
short
sharp
bark
the
next
moment
pollyanna
heard
voices
and
very
soon
their
owners
appeared
three
men
carrying
a
stretcher
and
various
other
articles
the
tallest
of
the
party
a
man
whom
pollyanna
knew
by
sight
as
dr
chilton
advanced
cheerily
well
my
little
lady
playing
nurse
oh
no
sir
smiled
pollyanna
i
only
held
his
head
i
given
him
a
mite
of
medicine
but
i
glad
i
was
so
am
i
nodded
the
doctor
as
he
turned
his
absorbed
attention
to
the
injured
man
chapter
xiv
just
a
matter
of
jelly
pollyanna
was
a
little
late
for
supper
on
the
night
of
the
accident
to
john
pendleton
but
as
it
happened
she
escaped
without
reproof
nancy
met
her
at
the
door
well
if
i
ai
glad
ter
be
settin
my
two
eyes
on
you
she
sighed
in
obvious
relief
it
six
i
know
it
admitted
pollyanna
anxiously
but
i
not
to
blame
truly
i
not
and
i
do
think
even
aunt
polly
will
say
i
am
she
wo
have
the
chance
retorted
nancy
with
huge
satisfaction
she
gone
gasped
pollyanna
you
do
mean
that
i
driven
her
away
through
pollyanna
mind
at
the
moment
trooped
remorseful
memories
of
the
morning
with
its
unwanted
boy
cat
and
dog
and
its
unwelcome
glad
and
forbidden
father
that
would
spring
to
her
forgetful
little
tongue
oh
i
did
drive
her
away
not
much
you
did
scoffed
nancy
her
cousin
died
suddenly
down
to
boston
and
she
had
ter
go
she
had
one
o
them
yeller
telegram
letters
after
you
went
away
this
afternoon
and
she
wo
be
back
for
three
days
now
i
guess
we
glad
all
right
we
be
keepin
house
tergether
jest
you
and
me
all
that
time
we
will
we
will
pollyanna
looked
shocked
glad
oh
nancy
when
it
a
funeral
oh
but
the
funeral
i
was
glad
for
miss
pollyanna
it
was
nancy
stopped
abruptly
a
shrewd
twinkle
came
into
her
eyes
why
miss
pollyanna
as
if
it
yerself
that
was
teachin
me
ter
play
the
game
she
reproached
her
gravely
pollyanna
puckered
her
forehead
into
a
troubled
frown
i
ca
help
it
nancy
she
argued
with
a
shake
of
her
head
it
must
be
that
there
are
some
things
that
is
right
to
play
the
game
on
and
i
sure
funerals
is
one
of
them
there
nothing
in
a
funeral
to
be
glad
nancy
chuckled
we
can
be
glad
she
observed
demurely
but
pollyanna
did
not
hear
she
had
begun
to
tell
of
the
accident
and
in
a
moment
nancy
was
listening
at
the
appointed
place
the
next
afternoon
pollyanna
met
jimmy
bean
according
to
agreement
as
was
to
be
expected
of
course
jimmy
showed
keen
disappointment
that
the
ladies
aid
preferred
a
little
india
boy
to
himself
well
maybe
is
natural
he
sighed
of
course
things
you
do
know
about
are
always
things
you
do
same
as
the
pertater
on
side
of
the
plate
is
always
the
biggest
but
i
wish
i
looked
that
way
ter
somebody
off
would
it
be
jest
great
now
if
only
somebody
over
in
india
wanted
me
pollyanna
clapped
her
hands
why
of
course
that
the
very
thing
jimmy
i
write
to
my
aiders
about
you
they
are
over
in
india
they
only
out
west
but
that
awful
far
away
just
the
same
i
reckon
you
think
so
if
come
all
the
way
here
as
i
did
jimmy
face
brightened
do
you
think
they
would
truly
take
me
he
asked
of
course
they
would
do
they
take
little
boys
in
india
to
bring
up
well
they
can
just
play
you
are
the
little
india
boy
this
time
i
reckon
you
far
enough
away
to
make
a
report
all
right
you
wait
i
write
i
write
white
no
i
write
jones
white
has
got
the
most
money
but
jones
gives
the
most
which
is
kind
of
funny
is
it
when
you
think
of
it
but
i
reckon
some
of
the
aiders
will
take
all
right
but
do
furgit
ter
say
i
work
fur
my
board
an
keep
put
in
jimmy
i
ai
no
beggar
an
is
even
with
ladies
aiders
i
he
hesitated
then
added
an
i
i
better
stay
where
i
be
fur
a
spell
yet
till
you
of
course
nodded
pollyanna
emphatically
then
i
know
just
where
to
find
you
and
they
take
you
i
sure
you
far
enough
away
for
that
did
aunt
polly
take
say
she
broke
off
suddenly
do
you
suppose
i
was
aunt
polly
little
girl
from
india
well
if
you
ai
the
queerest
kid
grinned
jimmy
as
he
turned
away
it
was
about
a
week
after
the
accident
in
pendleton
woods
that
pollyanna
said
to
her
aunt
one
morning
aunt
polly
please
would
you
mind
very
much
if
i
took
mrs
jelly
this
week
to
some
one
else
i
sure
mrs
snow
would
this
dear
me
pollyanna
what
are
you
up
to
now
sighed
her
aunt
you
are
the
most
extraordinary
child
pollyanna
frowned
a
little
anxiously
aunt
polly
please
what
is
extraordinary
if
you
extraordinary
you
ca
be
ordinary
can
you
you
certainly
can
oh
that
all
right
then
i
glad
i
extraordinary
sighed
pollyanna
her
face
clearing
you
see
white
used
to
say
rawson
was
a
very
ordinary
woman
and
she
disliked
rawson
something
awful
they
were
always
fight
i
mean
father
had
that
is
i
mean
we
had
more
trouble
keeping
peace
between
them
than
we
did
between
any
of
the
rest
of
the
aiders
corrected
pollyanna
a
little
breathless
from
her
efforts
to
steer
between
the
scylla
of
her
father
past
commands
in
regard
to
speaking
of
church
quarrels
and
the
charybdis
of
her
present
commands
in
regard
to
speaking
of
her
father
yes
yes
well
never
mind
interposed
aunt
polly
a
trifle
impatiently
you
do
run
on
so
pollyanna
and
no
matter
what
talking
about
you
always
bring
up
at
those
ladies
aiders
yes
smiled
pollyanna
cheerfully
i
reckon
i
do
maybe
but
you
see
they
used
to
bring
me
up
and
that
will
do
pollyanna
interrupted
a
cold
voice
now
what
is
it
about
this
jelly
nothing
aunt
polly
truly
that
you
would
mind
i
sure
you
let
me
take
jelly
to
her
so
i
thought
you
would
to
him
this
once
you
see
broken
legs
are
like
like
lifelong
invalids
so
his
wo
last
forever
as
mrs
snow
does
and
she
can
have
all
the
rest
of
the
things
after
just
once
or
leg
what
are
you
talking
about
pollyanna
pollyanna
stared
then
her
face
relaxed
oh
i
forgot
i
reckon
you
did
know
you
see
it
happened
while
you
were
gone
it
was
the
very
day
you
went
that
i
found
him
in
the
woods
you
know
and
i
had
to
unlock
his
house
and
telephone
for
the
men
and
the
doctor
and
hold
his
head
and
everything
and
of
course
then
i
came
away
and
have
seen
him
since
but
when
nancy
made
the
jelly
for
mrs
snow
this
week
i
thought
how
nice
it
would
be
if
i
could
take
it
to
him
instead
of
her
just
this
once
aunt
polly
may
i
yes
yes
i
suppose
so
acquiesced
miss
polly
a
little
wearily
who
did
you
say
he
was
the
man
i
mean
john
miss
polly
almost
sprang
from
her
chair
john
pendleton
yes
nancy
told
me
his
name
maybe
you
know
miss
polly
did
not
answer
this
instead
she
asked
do
you
know
him
pollyanna
nodded
oh
yes
he
always
speaks
and
smiles
now
he
only
cross
outside
you
know
i
go
and
get
the
jelly
nancy
had
it
fixed
when
i
came
in
finished
pollyanna
already
halfway
across
the
room
pollyanna
wait
miss
polly
voice
was
suddenly
very
stern
changed
my
mind
i
would
prefer
that
mrs
snow
had
that
jelly
as
usual
that
is
all
you
may
go
pollyanna
face
fell
oh
but
aunt
polly
hers
will
last
she
can
always
be
sick
and
have
things
you
know
but
his
is
just
a
broken
leg
and
legs
do
last
i
mean
broken
ones
he
had
it
a
whole
week
yes
i
remember
i
heard
john
pendleton
had
met
with
an
accident
said
miss
polly
a
little
stiffly
but
i
do
not
care
to
be
sending
jelly
to
john
pendleton
i
know
he
is
cross
outside
admitted
pollyanna
sadly
so
i
suppose
you
do
like
him
but
i
would
say
was
you
sent
it
i
say
was
me
i
like
him
i
be
glad
to
send
him
miss
polly
began
to
shake
her
head
again
then
suddenly
she
stopped
and
asked
in
a
curiously
quiet
voice
does
he
know
who
you
are
pollyanna
the
little
girl
sighed
i
reckon
not
i
told
him
my
name
once
but
he
never
calls
me
it
does
he
know
where
you
live
oh
no
i
never
told
him
then
he
does
know
you
my
niece
i
do
think
for
a
moment
there
was
silence
miss
polly
was
looking
at
pollyanna
with
eyes
that
did
not
seem
to
see
her
at
all
the
little
girl
shifting
impatiently
from
one
small
foot
to
the
other
sighed
audibly
then
miss
polly
roused
herself
with
a
start
very
well
pollyanna
she
said
at
last
still
in
that
queer
voice
so
unlike
her
own
you
may
you
may
take
the
jelly
to
pendleton
as
your
own
gift
but
understand
i
do
not
send
it
be
very
sure
that
he
does
not
think
i
do
yes
no
thank
you
aunt
polly
exulted
pollyanna
as
she
flew
through
the
door
chapter
xv
chilton
the
great
gray
pile
of
masonry
looked
very
different
to
pollyanna
when
she
made
her
second
visit
to
the
house
of
john
pendleton
windows
were
open
an
elderly
woman
was
hanging
out
clothes
in
the
back
yard
and
the
doctor
gig
stood
under
the
as
before
pollyanna
went
to
the
side
door
this
time
she
rang
the
bell
her
fingers
were
not
stiff
from
a
tight
clutch
on
a
bunch
of
keys
a
small
dog
bounded
up
the
steps
to
greet
her
but
there
was
a
slight
delay
before
the
woman
who
had
been
hanging
out
the
clothes
opened
the
door
if
you
please
i
brought
some
jelly
for
pendleton
smiled
pollyanna
thank
you
said
the
woman
reaching
for
the
bowl
in
the
little
hand
who
shall
i
say
sent
it
and
it
jelly
the
doctor
coming
into
the
hall
at
that
moment
heard
the
woman
words
and
saw
the
disappointed
look
on
pollyanna
face
he
stepped
quickly
forward
ah
some
jelly
he
asked
genially
that
will
be
fine
maybe
you
like
to
see
our
patient
eh
oh
yes
sir
beamed
pollyanna
and
the
woman
in
obedience
to
a
nod
from
the
doctor
led
the
way
down
the
hall
at
once
though
plainly
with
vast
surprise
on
her
face
behind
the
doctor
a
young
man
a
trained
nurse
from
the
nearest
city
gave
a
disturbed
exclamation
but
doctor
did
pendleton
give
orders
not
to
admit
any
one
oh
yes
nodded
the
doctor
imperturbably
but
i
giving
orders
now
i
take
the
then
he
added
whimsically
you
do
know
of
course
but
that
little
girl
is
better
than
a
bottle
of
tonic
any
day
if
anything
or
anybody
can
take
the
grouch
out
of
pendleton
this
afternoon
she
can
that
why
i
sent
her
who
is
she
for
one
brief
moment
the
doctor
hesitated
she
the
niece
of
one
of
our
best
known
residents
her
name
is
pollyanna
whittier
i
i
do
happen
to
enjoy
a
very
extensive
personal
acquaintance
with
the
little
lady
as
yet
but
lots
of
my
patients
do
i
thankful
to
say
the
nurse
smiled
indeed
and
what
are
the
special
ingredients
of
this
tonic
of
hers
the
doctor
shook
his
head
i
do
know
as
near
as
i
can
find
out
it
is
an
overwhelming
unquenchable
gladness
for
everything
that
has
happened
or
is
going
to
happen
at
any
rate
her
quaint
speeches
are
constantly
being
repeated
to
me
and
as
near
as
i
can
make
out
being
glad
is
the
tenor
of
most
of
them
all
is
he
added
with
another
whimsical
smile
as
he
stepped
out
on
to
the
porch
i
wish
i
could
prescribe
her
and
buy
her
as
i
would
a
box
of
pills
though
if
there
gets
to
be
many
of
her
in
the
world
you
and
i
might
as
well
go
to
and
for
all
the
money
we
get
out
of
nursing
and
doctoring
he
laughed
picking
up
the
reins
and
stepping
into
the
gig
pollyanna
meanwhile
in
accordance
with
the
doctor
orders
was
being
escorted
to
john
pendleton
rooms
her
way
led
through
the
great
library
at
the
end
of
the
hall
and
rapid
as
was
her
progress
through
it
pollyanna
saw
at
once
that
great
changes
had
taken
place
the
walls
and
the
crimson
curtains
were
the
same
but
there
was
no
litter
on
the
floor
no
untidiness
on
the
desk
and
not
so
much
as
a
grain
of
dust
in
sight
the
telephone
card
hung
in
its
proper
place
and
the
brass
andirons
had
been
polished
one
of
the
mysterious
doors
was
open
and
it
was
toward
this
that
the
maid
led
the
way
a
moment
later
pollyanna
found
herself
in
a
sumptuously
furnished
bedroom
while
the
maid
was
saying
in
a
frightened
voice
if
you
please
sir
here
here
a
little
girl
with
some
jelly
the
doctor
said
i
was
to
to
bring
her
the
next
moment
pollyanna
found
herself
alone
with
a
very
man
lying
flat
on
his
back
in
bed
see
here
did
i
say
began
an
angry
voice
oh
it
you
it
broke
off
not
very
graciously
as
pollyanna
advanced
toward
the
bed
yes
sir
smiled
pollyanna
oh
i
so
glad
they
let
me
in
you
see
at
first
the
lady
took
my
jelly
and
i
was
so
afraid
i
going
to
see
you
at
all
then
the
doctor
came
and
he
said
i
might
was
he
lovely
to
let
me
see
you
in
spite
of
himself
the
man
lips
twitched
into
a
smile
but
all
he
said
was
humph
and
i
brought
you
some
jelly
resumed
pollyanna
i
hope
you
like
it
there
was
a
rising
inflection
in
her
voice
never
ate
the
fleeting
smile
had
gone
and
the
scowl
had
come
back
to
the
man
face
for
a
brief
instant
pollyanna
countenance
showed
disappointment
but
it
cleared
as
she
set
the
bowl
of
jelly
down
did
you
well
if
you
did
then
you
ca
know
you
do
like
it
anyhow
can
you
so
i
reckon
i
glad
you
have
after
all
now
if
you
knew
yes
yes
well
there
one
thing
i
know
all
right
and
that
is
that
i
flat
on
my
back
right
here
this
minute
and
that
i
liable
to
stay
here
till
doomsday
i
pollyanna
looked
shocked
oh
no
it
could
be
till
doomsday
you
know
when
the
angel
gabriel
blows
his
trumpet
unless
it
should
come
quicker
than
we
think
it
will
oh
of
course
i
know
the
bible
says
it
may
come
quicker
than
we
think
but
i
do
think
it
will
that
is
of
course
i
believe
the
bible
but
i
mean
i
do
think
it
will
come
as
much
quicker
as
it
would
if
it
should
come
now
and
john
pendleton
laughed
suddenly
and
aloud
the
nurse
coming
in
at
that
moment
heard
the
laugh
and
beat
a
hurried
but
a
very
silent
retreat
he
had
the
air
of
a
frightened
cook
who
seeing
the
danger
of
a
breath
of
cold
air
striking
a
cake
hastily
shuts
the
oven
door
are
you
getting
a
little
mixed
asked
john
pendleton
of
pollyanna
the
little
girl
laughed
maybe
but
what
i
mean
is
that
legs
do
last
broken
ones
you
know
like
lifelong
invalids
same
as
mrs
snow
has
got
so
yours
last
till
doomsday
at
all
i
should
think
you
could
be
glad
of
oh
i
am
retorted
the
man
grimly
and
you
did
break
but
one
you
can
be
glad
was
pollyanna
was
warming
to
her
task
of
course
so
fortunate
sniffed
the
man
with
uplifted
eyebrows
looking
at
it
from
that
standpoint
i
suppose
i
might
be
glad
i
a
centipede
and
did
break
fifty
pollyanna
chuckled
oh
that
the
best
yet
she
crowed
i
know
what
a
centipede
is
they
got
lots
of
legs
and
you
can
be
glad
oh
of
course
interrupted
the
man
sharply
all
the
old
bitterness
coming
back
to
his
voice
i
can
be
glad
too
for
all
the
rest
i
suppose
the
nurse
and
the
doctor
and
that
confounded
woman
in
the
kitchen
why
yes
sir
only
think
how
bad
be
if
you
did
have
them
well
i
eh
he
demanded
sharply
why
i
say
only
think
how
bad
it
would
be
if
you
did
have
and
you
lying
here
like
this
as
if
that
was
the
very
thing
that
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
whole
matter
retorted
the
man
testily
because
i
am
lying
here
like
this
and
yet
you
expect
me
to
say
i
glad
because
of
a
fool
woman
who
disarranges
the
whole
house
and
calls
it
and
a
man
who
aids
and
abets
her
in
it
and
calls
it
to
say
nothing
of
the
doctor
who
eggs
both
on
and
the
whole
bunch
of
them
meanwhile
expecting
me
to
pay
them
for
it
and
pay
them
well
too
pollyanna
frowned
sympathetically
yes
i
know
that
part
is
too
bad
about
the
money
when
you
been
saving
it
too
all
this
when
eh
saving
it
buying
beans
and
fish
balls
you
know
say
do
you
like
beans
or
do
you
like
turkey
better
only
on
account
of
the
sixty
cents
look
child
what
are
you
talking
about
pollyanna
smiled
radiantly
about
your
money
you
know
denying
yourself
and
saving
it
for
the
heathen
you
see
i
found
out
about
it
why
pendleton
that
one
of
the
ways
i
knew
you
were
cross
inside
nancy
told
the
man
jaw
dropped
nancy
told
you
i
was
saving
money
for
the
well
may
i
inquire
who
nancy
is
our
nancy
she
works
for
aunt
aunt
polly
well
who
is
aunt
polly
she
miss
polly
harrington
i
live
with
the
man
made
a
sudden
movement
miss
polly
harrington
he
breathed
you
live
with
her
yes
i
her
niece
she
taken
me
to
bring
up
on
account
of
my
mother
you
know
faltered
pollyanna
in
a
low
voice
she
was
her
sister
and
after
father
went
to
be
with
her
and
the
rest
of
us
in
heaven
there
was
any
one
left
for
me
down
here
but
the
ladies
aid
so
she
took
the
man
did
not
answer
his
face
as
he
lay
back
on
the
pillow
now
was
very
white
so
white
that
pollyanna
was
frightened
she
rose
uncertainly
to
her
feet
i
reckon
maybe
i
better
go
now
she
proposed
i
i
hope
like
the
the
man
turned
his
head
suddenly
and
opened
his
eyes
there
was
a
curious
longing
in
their
dark
depths
which
even
pollyanna
saw
and
at
which
she
marvelled
and
so
you
are
miss
polly
harrington
niece
he
said
gently
yes
still
the
man
dark
eyes
lingered
on
her
face
until
pollyanna
feeling
vaguely
restless
murmured
i
i
suppose
you
know
john
pendleton
lips
curved
in
an
odd
smile
oh
yes
i
know
he
hesitated
then
went
on
still
with
that
curious
smile
but
you
do
mean
you
ca
mean
that
it
was
miss
polly
harrington
who
sent
that
jelly
to
me
he
said
slowly
pollyanna
looked
distressed
sir
she
did
she
said
i
must
be
very
sure
not
to
let
you
think
she
did
send
it
but
i
i
thought
as
much
vouchsafed
the
man
shortly
turning
away
his
head
and
pollyanna
still
more
distressed
tiptoed
from
the
room
under
the
she
found
the
doctor
waiting
in
his
gig
the
nurse
stood
on
the
steps
well
miss
pollyanna
may
i
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
home
asked
the
doctor
smilingly
i
started
to
drive
on
a
few
minutes
ago
then
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
wait
for
thank
you
sir
i
glad
you
did
i
just
love
to
ride
beamed
pollyanna
as
he
reached
out
his
hand
to
help
her
in
do
you
smiled
the
doctor
nodding
his
head
in
farewell
to
the
young
man
on
the
steps
well
as
near
as
i
can
judge
there
are
a
good
many
things
you
to
do
eh
he
added
as
they
drove
briskly
away
pollyanna
laughed
why
i
do
know
i
reckon
perhaps
there
are
she
admitted
i
like
to
do
everything
that
living
of
course
i
do
like
the
other
things
very
well
sewing
and
reading
out
loud
and
all
that
but
they
are
no
what
are
they
then
aunt
polly
says
they
to
live
sighed
pollyanna
with
a
rueful
smile
the
doctor
smiled
now
a
little
queerly
does
she
well
i
should
think
she
might
say
just
yes
responded
pollyanna
but
i
do
see
it
that
way
at
all
i
think
you
have
to
learn
how
to
live
i
did
the
doctor
drew
a
long
sigh
after
all
i
afraid
some
of
us
do
have
to
little
girl
he
said
then
for
a
time
he
was
silent
pollyanna
stealing
a
glance
at
his
face
felt
vaguely
sorry
for
him
he
looked
so
sad
she
wished
uneasily
that
she
could
do
it
was
this
perhaps
that
caused
her
to
say
in
a
timid
voice
dr
chilton
i
should
think
being
a
doctor
would
be
the
very
gladdest
kind
of
a
business
there
the
doctor
turned
in
surprise
when
i
see
so
much
suffering
always
everywhere
i
go
he
cried
she
nodded
i
know
but
you
helping
it
do
you
see
and
of
course
glad
to
help
it
and
so
that
makes
you
the
gladdest
of
any
of
us
all
the
the
doctor
eyes
filled
with
sudden
hot
tears
the
doctor
life
was
a
singularly
lonely
one
he
had
no
wife
and
no
home
save
his
office
in
a
boarding
house
his
profession
was
very
dear
to
him
looking
now
into
pollyanna
shining
eyes
he
felt
as
if
a
loving
hand
had
been
suddenly
laid
on
his
head
in
blessing
he
knew
too
that
never
again
would
a
long
day
work
or
a
long
night
weariness
be
quite
without
that
exaltation
that
had
come
to
him
through
pollyanna
eyes
god
bless
you
little
girl
he
said
unsteadily
then
with
the
bright
smile
his
patients
knew
and
loved
so
well
he
added
and
i
thinking
after
all
that
it
was
the
doctor
quite
as
much
as
his
patients
that
needed
a
draft
of
that
tonic
all
of
which
puzzled
pollyanna
very
much
until
a
chipmunk
running
across
the
road
drove
the
whole
matter
from
her
mind
the
doctor
left
pollyanna
at
her
own
door
smiled
at
nancy
who
was
sweeping
off
the
front
porch
then
drove
rapidly
away
i
had
a
perfectly
beautiful
ride
with
the
doctor
announced
pollyanna
bounding
up
the
steps
he
lovely
nancy
is
he
yes
and
i
told
him
i
should
think
his
business
would
be
the
very
gladdest
one
there
what
goin
ter
see
sick
folks
an
folks
what
ai
sick
but
thinks
they
is
which
is
worse
nancy
face
showed
open
skepticism
pollyanna
laughed
gleefully
yes
that
what
he
said
too
but
there
is
a
way
to
be
glad
even
then
guess
nancy
frowned
in
meditation
nancy
was
getting
so
she
could
play
this
game
of
being
glad
quite
successfully
she
thought
she
rather
enjoyed
studying
out
pollyanna
posers
too
as
she
called
some
of
the
little
girl
questions
oh
i
know
she
chuckled
it
just
the
opposite
from
what
you
told
mis
opposite
repeated
pollyanna
obviously
puzzled
yes
you
told
her
she
could
be
glad
because
other
folks
was
like
her
all
sick
you
yes
nodded
pollyanna
well
the
doctor
can
be
glad
because
he
is
like
other
folks
the
sick
ones
i
mean
what
he
doctors
finished
nancy
in
triumph
it
was
pollyanna
turn
to
frown
why
she
admitted
of
course
that
is
one
way
but
it
is
the
way
i
said
and
someway
i
do
seem
to
quite
like
the
sound
of
it
it
is
exactly
as
if
he
said
he
was
glad
they
were
sick
but
you
do
play
the
game
so
funny
sometimes
nancy
she
sighed
as
she
went
into
the
house
pollyanna
found
her
aunt
in
the
sitting
room
who
was
that
man
the
one
who
drove
into
the
yard
pollyanna
questioned
the
lady
a
little
sharply
why
aunt
polly
that
was
chilton
do
you
know
him
dr
chilton
what
was
he
doing
here
he
drove
me
home
oh
and
i
gave
the
jelly
to
pendleton
and
miss
polly
lifted
her
head
quickly
pollyanna
he
did
not
think
i
sent
it
oh
no
aunt
polly
i
told
him
you
miss
polly
grew
a
sudden
vivid
pink
you
told
him
i
did
pollyanna
opened
wide
her
eyes
at
the
remonstrative
dismay
in
her
voice
why
aunt
polly
you
said
to
aunt
polly
sighed
i
said
pollyanna
that
i
did
not
send
it
and
for
you
to
be
very
sure
that
he
did
not
think
i
did
which
is
a
very
different
matter
from
telling
him
outright
that
i
did
not
send
and
she
turned
vexedly
away
dear
me
well
i
do
see
where
the
difference
is
sighed
pollyanna
as
she
went
to
hang
her
hat
on
the
one
particular
hook
in
the
house
upon
which
aunt
polly
had
said
that
it
must
be
hung
chapter
xvi
a
red
rose
and
a
lace
shawl
it
was
on
a
rainy
day
about
a
week
after
pollyanna
visit
to
john
pendleton
that
miss
polly
was
driven
by
timothy
to
an
early
afternoon
committee
meeting
of
the
ladies
aid
society
when
she
returned
at
three
her
cheeks
were
a
bright
pretty
pink
and
her
hair
blown
by
the
damp
wind
had
fluffed
into
kinks
and
curls
wherever
the
loosened
pins
had
given
leave
pollyanna
had
never
before
seen
her
aunt
look
like
this
oh
oh
oh
why
aunt
polly
you
got
too
she
cried
rapturously
dancing
round
and
round
her
aunt
as
that
lady
entered
the
sitting
room
got
what
you
impossible
child
pollyanna
was
still
revolving
round
and
round
her
aunt
and
i
never
knew
you
had
can
folks
have
when
you
do
know
they
got
do
you
suppose
i
could
i
get
to
heaven
i
mean
she
cried
pulling
out
with
eager
fingers
the
straight
locks
above
her
ears
but
then
they
would
be
black
if
they
did
come
you
ca
hide
the
black
pollyanna
what
does
all
this
mean
demanded
aunt
polly
hurriedly
removing
her
hat
and
trying
to
smooth
back
her
disordered
hair
no
no
please
aunt
polly
pollyanna
jubilant
voice
turned
to
one
of
distressed
appeal
do
smooth
out
it
those
that
i
talking
about
those
darling
little
black
curls
oh
aunt
polly
they
so
pretty
nonsense
what
do
you
mean
pollyanna
by
going
to
the
ladies
aid
the
other
day
in
that
absurd
fashion
about
that
beggar
boy
but
it
is
nonsense
urged
pollyanna
answering
only
the
first
of
her
aunt
remarks
you
do
know
how
pretty
you
look
with
your
hair
like
that
oh
aunt
polly
please
may
i
do
your
hair
like
i
did
mrs
snow
and
put
in
a
flower
i
so
love
to
see
you
that
way
why
be
ever
so
much
prettier
than
she
was
pollyanna
miss
polly
spoke
very
sharply
all
the
more
sharply
because
pollyanna
words
had
given
her
an
odd
throb
of
joy
when
before
had
anybody
cared
how
she
or
her
hair
looked
when
before
had
anybody
loved
to
see
her
pretty
pollyanna
you
did
not
answer
my
question
why
did
you
go
to
the
ladies
aid
in
that
absurd
fashion
yes
i
know
but
please
i
did
know
it
was
absurd
until
i
went
and
found
out
they
rather
see
their
report
grow
than
jimmy
so
then
i
wrote
to
my
ladies
aiders
jimmy
is
far
away
from
them
you
know
and
i
thought
maybe
he
could
be
their
little
india
boy
same
as
aunt
polly
was
i
your
little
india
girl
and
aunt
polly
you
will
let
me
do
your
hair
wo
you
aunt
polly
put
her
hand
to
her
throat
the
old
helpless
feeling
was
upon
her
she
knew
but
pollyanna
when
the
ladies
told
me
this
afternoon
how
you
came
to
them
i
was
so
ashamed
i
pollyanna
began
to
dance
up
and
down
lightly
on
her
toes
you
did
you
did
say
i
could
do
your
hair
she
crowed
triumphantly
and
so
i
sure
it
means
just
the
other
way
sort
of
like
it
did
the
other
day
about
pendleton
jelly
that
you
did
send
but
did
want
me
to
say
you
did
send
you
know
now
wait
just
where
you
are
i
get
a
but
pollyanna
pollyanna
remonstrated
aunt
polly
following
the
little
girl
from
the
room
and
panting
after
her
oh
did
you
come
up
here
pollyanna
greeted
her
at
the
door
of
miss
polly
own
room
that
be
nicer
yet
i
got
the
comb
now
sit
down
please
right
here
oh
i
so
glad
you
let
me
do
it
but
pollyanna
i
i
miss
polly
did
not
finish
her
sentence
to
her
helpless
amazement
she
found
herself
in
the
low
chair
before
the
dressing
table
with
her
hair
already
tumbling
about
her
ears
under
ten
eager
but
very
gentle
fingers
oh
my
what
pretty
hair
you
got
prattled
pollyanna
and
so
much
more
of
it
than
mrs
snow
has
too
but
of
course
you
need
more
anyhow
because
you
well
and
can
go
to
places
where
folks
can
see
it
my
i
reckon
folks
be
glad
when
they
do
see
it
and
surprised
too
you
hid
it
so
long
why
aunt
polly
i
make
you
so
pretty
everybody
just
love
to
look
at
you
pollyanna
gasped
a
stifled
but
shocked
voice
from
a
veil
of
hair
i
i
sure
i
do
know
why
i
letting
you
do
this
silly
why
aunt
polly
i
should
think
you
be
glad
to
have
folks
like
to
look
at
you
do
you
like
to
look
at
pretty
things
i
ever
so
much
happier
when
i
look
at
pretty
folks
when
i
look
at
the
other
kind
i
so
sorry
for
but
but
and
i
just
love
to
do
folks
hair
purred
pollyanna
contentedly
i
did
quite
a
lot
of
the
ladies
aiders
but
there
was
any
of
them
so
nice
as
yours
white
was
pretty
nice
though
and
she
looked
just
lovely
one
day
when
i
dressed
her
up
in
oh
aunt
polly
i
just
happened
to
think
of
something
but
it
a
secret
and
i
tell
now
your
hair
is
almost
done
and
pretty
quick
i
going
to
leave
you
just
a
minute
and
you
must
promise
promise
promise
not
to
stir
nor
peek
even
till
i
come
back
now
remember
she
finished
as
she
ran
from
the
room
aloud
miss
polly
said
nothing
to
herself
she
said
that
of
course
she
should
at
once
undo
the
absurd
work
of
her
niece
fingers
and
put
her
hair
up
properly
again
as
for
peeking
just
as
if
she
cared
how
at
that
moment
unaccountably
miss
polly
caught
a
glimpse
of
herself
in
the
mirror
of
the
dressing
table
and
what
she
saw
sent
such
a
flush
of
rosy
color
to
her
cheeks
that
she
only
flushed
the
more
at
the
sight
she
saw
a
face
not
young
it
is
true
but
just
now
alight
with
excitement
and
surprise
the
cheeks
were
a
pretty
pink
the
eyes
sparkled
the
hair
dark
and
still
damp
from
the
outdoor
air
lay
in
loose
waves
about
the
forehead
and
curved
back
over
the
ears
in
wonderfully
becoming
lines
with
softening
little
curls
here
and
there
so
amazed
and
so
absorbed
was
miss
polly
with
what
she
saw
in
the
glass
that
she
quite
forgot
her
determination
to
do
over
her
hair
until
she
heard
pollyanna
enter
the
room
again
before
she
could
move
then
she
felt
a
folded
something
slipped
across
her
eyes
and
tied
in
the
back
pollyanna
pollyanna
what
are
you
doing
she
cried
pollyanna
chuckled
that
just
what
i
do
want
you
to
know
aunt
polly
and
i
was
afraid
you
would
peek
so
i
tied
on
the
handkerchief
now
sit
still
it
take
but
just
a
minute
then
i
let
you
but
pollyanna
began
miss
polly
struggling
blindly
to
her
feet
you
must
take
this
off
you
child
child
what
are
you
doing
she
gasped
as
she
felt
a
soft
something
slipped
about
her
shoulders
pollyanna
only
chuckled
the
more
gleefully
with
trembling
fingers
she
was
draping
about
her
aunt
shoulders
the
fleecy
folds
of
a
beautiful
lace
shawl
yellowed
from
long
years
of
packing
away
and
fragrant
with
lavender
pollyanna
had
found
the
shawl
the
week
before
when
nancy
had
been
regulating
the
attic
and
it
had
occurred
to
her
that
there
was
no
reason
why
her
aunt
as
well
as
white
of
her
western
home
should
not
be
dressed
her
task
completed
pollyanna
surveyed
her
work
with
eyes
that
approved
but
that
saw
yet
one
touch
wanting
promptly
therefore
she
pulled
her
aunt
toward
the
sun
parlor
where
she
could
see
a
belated
red
rose
blooming
on
the
trellis
within
reach
of
her
hand
pollyanna
what
are
you
doing
where
are
you
taking
me
to
recoiled
aunt
polly
vainly
trying
to
hold
herself
back
pollyanna
i
shall
not
it
just
to
the
sun
parlor
only
a
minute
i
have
you
ready
now
no
time
panted
pollyanna
reaching
for
the
rose
and
thrusting
it
into
the
soft
hair
above
miss
polly
left
ear
there
she
exulted
untying
the
knot
of
the
handkerchief
and
flinging
the
bit
of
linen
far
from
her
oh
aunt
polly
now
i
reckon
you
be
glad
i
dressed
you
up
for
one
dazed
moment
miss
polly
looked
at
her
bedecked
self
and
at
her
surroundings
then
she
gave
a
low
cry
and
fled
to
her
room
pollyanna
following
the
direction
of
her
aunt
last
dismayed
gaze
saw
through
the
open
windows
of
the
sun
parlor
the
horse
and
gig
turning
into
the
driveway
she
recognized
at
once
the
man
who
held
the
reins
delightedly
she
leaned
forward
dr
chilton
chilton
did
you
want
to
see
me
i
up
yes
smiled
the
doctor
a
little
gravely
will
you
come
down
please
in
the
bedroom
pollyanna
found
a
woman
plucking
at
the
pins
that
held
a
lace
shawl
in
place
pollyanna
how
could
you
moaned
the
woman
to
think
of
your
rigging
me
up
like
this
and
then
letting
me
be
seen
pollyanna
stopped
in
dismay
but
you
looked
lovely
perfectly
lovely
aunt
polly
and
scorned
the
woman
flinging
the
shawl
to
one
side
and
attacking
her
hair
with
shaking
fingers
oh
aunt
polly
please
please
let
the
hair
stay
stay
like
this
as
if
i
would
and
miss
polly
pulled
the
locks
so
tightly
back
that
the
last
curl
lay
stretched
dead
at
the
ends
of
her
fingers
o
dear
and
you
did
look
so
pretty
almost
sobbed
pollyanna
as
she
stumbled
through
the
door
pollyanna
found
the
doctor
waiting
in
his
gig
i
prescribed
you
for
a
patient
and
he
sent
me
to
get
the
prescription
filled
announced
the
doctor
will
you
go
you
mean
an
errand
to
the
drug
store
asked
pollyanna
a
little
uncertainly
i
used
to
go
some
for
the
ladies
the
doctor
shook
his
head
with
a
smile
not
exactly
it
john
pendleton
he
would
like
to
see
you
if
you
be
so
good
as
to
come
it
stopped
raining
so
i
drove
down
after
you
will
you
come
i
call
for
you
and
bring
you
back
before
six
i
love
to
exclaimed
pollyanna
let
me
ask
aunt
in
a
few
moments
she
returned
hat
in
hand
but
with
rather
a
sober
face
did
your
aunt
want
you
to
go
asked
the
doctor
a
little
diffidently
as
they
drove
away
sighed
pollyanna
she
she
wanted
me
to
go
too
much
wanted
you
to
go
too
much
pollyanna
sighed
again
yes
i
reckon
she
meant
she
did
want
me
there
you
see
she
said
yes
run
along
run
along
do
i
wish
you
gone
before
the
doctor
smiled
but
with
his
lips
only
his
eyes
were
very
grave
for
some
time
he
said
nothing
then
a
little
hesitatingly
he
asked
was
it
your
aunt
i
saw
with
you
a
few
minutes
ago
in
the
window
of
the
sun
parlor
pollyanna
drew
a
long
breath
yes
that
what
the
whole
trouble
i
suppose
you
see
i
dressed
her
up
in
a
perfectly
lovely
lace
shawl
i
found
and
i
fixed
her
hair
and
put
on
a
rose
and
she
looked
so
pretty
did
you
think
she
looked
just
lovely
for
a
moment
the
doctor
did
not
answer
when
he
did
speak
his
voice
was
so
low
pollyanna
could
but
just
hear
the
words
yes
pollyanna
i
i
thought
she
did
look
just
did
you
i
so
glad
i
tell
her
nodded
the
little
girl
contentedly
to
her
surprise
the
doctor
gave
a
sudden
exclamation
never
pollyanna
i
i
afraid
i
shall
have
to
ask
you
not
to
tell
her
why
chilton
why
not
i
should
think
you
be
glad
but
she
might
not
be
cut
in
the
doctor
pollyanna
considered
this
for
a
moment
that
so
maybe
she
would
she
sighed
i
remember
now
was
she
saw
you
that
she
ran
and
she
she
spoke
afterwards
about
her
being
seen
in
that
i
thought
as
much
declared
the
doctor
under
his
breath
still
i
do
see
why
maintained
pollyanna
when
she
looked
so
pretty
the
doctor
said
nothing
he
did
not
speak
again
indeed
until
they
were
almost
to
the
great
stone
house
in
which
john
pendleton
lay
with
a
broken
leg
chapter
xvii
just
like
a
book
john
pendleton
greeted
pollyanna
with
a
smile
well
miss
pollyanna
i
thinking
you
must
be
a
very
forgiving
little
person
else
you
would
have
come
to
see
me
again
why
pendleton
i
was
real
glad
to
come
and
i
sure
i
do
see
why
i
should
be
oh
well
you
know
i
was
pretty
cross
with
you
i
afraid
both
the
other
day
when
you
so
kindly
brought
me
the
jelly
and
that
time
when
you
found
me
with
the
broken
leg
at
first
by
the
way
too
i
think
i
ever
thanked
you
for
that
now
i
sure
that
even
you
would
admit
that
you
were
very
forgiving
to
come
and
see
me
after
such
ungrateful
treatment
as
that
pollyanna
stirred
uneasily
but
i
was
glad
to
find
you
that
is
i
do
mean
i
was
glad
your
leg
was
broken
of
course
she
corrected
hurriedly
john
pendleton
smiled
i
understand
your
tongue
does
get
away
with
you
once
in
a
while
does
it
miss
pollyanna
i
do
thank
you
however
and
i
consider
you
a
very
brave
little
girl
to
do
what
you
did
that
day
i
thank
you
for
the
jelly
too
he
added
in
a
lighter
voice
did
you
like
it
asked
pollyanna
with
interest
very
much
i
suppose
there
is
any
more
that
that
aunt
polly
did
send
is
there
he
asked
with
an
odd
smile
his
visitor
looked
distressed
she
hesitated
then
went
on
with
heightened
color
please
pendleton
i
did
mean
to
be
rude
the
other
day
when
i
said
aunt
polly
did
not
send
the
there
was
no
answer
john
pendleton
was
not
smiling
now
he
was
looking
straight
ahead
of
him
with
eyes
that
seemed
to
be
gazing
through
and
beyond
the
object
before
them
after
a
time
he
drew
a
long
sigh
and
turned
to
pollyanna
when
he
spoke
his
voice
carried
the
old
nervous
fretfulness
well
well
this
will
never
do
at
all
i
did
send
for
you
to
see
me
moping
this
time
listen
out
in
the
library
the
big
room
where
the
telephone
is
you
know
you
will
find
a
carved
box
on
the
lower
shelf
of
the
big
case
with
glass
doors
in
the
corner
not
far
from
the
fireplace
that
is
it
be
there
if
that
confounded
woman
has
it
to
somewhere
else
you
may
bring
it
to
me
it
is
heavy
but
not
too
heavy
for
you
to
carry
i
oh
i
awfully
strong
declared
pollyanna
cheerfully
as
she
sprang
to
her
feet
in
a
minute
she
had
returned
with
the
box
it
was
a
wonderful
that
pollyanna
spent
then
the
box
was
full
of
treasures
curios
that
john
pendleton
had
picked
up
in
years
of
travel
and
concerning
each
there
was
some
entertaining
story
whether
it
were
a
set
of
exquisitely
carved
chessmen
from
china
or
a
little
jade
idol
from
india
it
was
after
she
had
heard
the
story
about
the
idol
that
pollyanna
murmured
wistfully
well
i
suppose
it
would
be
better
to
take
a
little
boy
in
india
to
bring
up
one
that
did
know
any
more
than
to
think
that
god
was
in
that
than
it
would
be
to
take
jimmy
bean
a
little
boy
who
knows
god
is
up
in
the
sky
still
i
ca
help
wishing
they
had
wanted
jimmy
bean
too
besides
the
india
john
pendleton
did
not
seem
to
hear
again
his
eyes
were
staring
straight
before
him
looking
at
nothing
but
soon
he
had
roused
himself
and
had
picked
up
another
curio
to
talk
about
the
visit
certainly
was
a
delightful
one
but
before
it
was
over
pollyanna
was
realizing
that
they
were
talking
about
something
besides
the
wonderful
things
in
the
beautiful
carved
box
they
were
talking
of
herself
of
nancy
of
aunt
polly
and
of
her
daily
life
they
were
talking
too
even
of
the
life
and
home
long
ago
in
the
far
western
town
not
until
it
was
nearly
time
for
her
to
go
did
the
man
say
in
a
voice
pollyanna
had
never
before
heard
from
stern
john
pendleton
little
girl
i
want
you
to
come
to
see
me
often
will
you
lonesome
and
i
need
you
there
another
reason
and
i
going
to
tell
you
that
too
i
thought
at
first
after
i
found
out
who
you
were
the
other
day
that
i
did
want
you
to
come
any
more
you
reminded
me
of
of
something
i
have
tried
for
long
years
to
forget
so
i
said
to
myself
that
i
never
wanted
to
see
you
again
and
every
day
when
the
doctor
asked
if
i
would
let
him
bring
you
to
me
i
said
no
but
after
a
time
i
found
i
was
wanting
to
see
you
so
much
that
that
the
fact
that
i
was
seeing
you
was
making
me
remember
all
the
more
vividly
the
thing
i
was
so
wanting
to
forget
so
now
i
want
you
to
come
will
you
little
girl
why
yes
pendleton
breathed
pollyanna
her
eyes
luminous
with
sympathy
for
the
man
lying
back
on
the
pillow
before
her
love
to
come
thank
you
said
john
pendleton
gently
after
supper
that
evening
pollyanna
sitting
on
the
back
porch
told
nancy
all
about
john
pendleton
wonderful
carved
box
and
the
still
more
wonderful
things
it
contained
and
ter
think
sighed
nancy
that
he
showed
ye
all
them
things
and
told
ye
about
like
that
him
that
so
cross
he
never
talks
ter
no
one
no
one
oh
but
he
is
cross
nancy
only
outside
demurred
pollyanna
with
quick
loyalty
i
do
see
why
everybody
thinks
he
so
bad
either
they
would
if
they
knew
him
but
even
aunt
polly
does
like
him
very
well
she
would
send
the
jelly
to
him
you
know
and
she
was
so
afraid
he
think
she
did
send
it
probably
she
did
call
him
no
duty
shrugged
nancy
but
what
beats
me
is
how
he
happened
ter
take
ter
you
so
miss
pollyanna
meanin
no
offence
ter
you
of
course
but
he
ai
the
sort
o
man
what
takes
ter
kids
he
ai
he
pollyanna
smiled
happily
but
he
did
nancy
she
nodded
only
i
reckon
even
he
did
want
to
all
the
time
why
only
he
owned
up
that
one
time
he
just
felt
he
never
wanted
to
see
me
again
because
i
reminded
him
of
something
he
wanted
to
forget
but
afterwards
what
that
interrupted
nancy
excitedly
he
said
you
reminded
him
of
something
he
wanted
to
forget
yes
but
afterwards
what
was
it
nancy
was
eagerly
insistent
he
did
tell
me
he
just
said
it
was
the
mystery
breathed
nancy
in
an
awestruck
voice
that
why
he
took
to
you
in
the
first
place
oh

of
maud
secret
and
lost
heir
and
for
years
all
of
had
mysteries
and
things
just

he
said

there
a
dear
no
wonder
he
took
ter
you
no
wonder
no
wonder
but
he
did
cried
pollyanna
not
till
talked
to
him
first
and
he
did
even
know
who
i
was
till
i
took
the
jelly
and
had
to
make
him
understand
that
aunt
polly
did
send
it
and
nancy
sprang
to
her
feet
and
clasped
her
hands
together
suddenly
oh
miss
pollyanna
i
know
i
know
i
know
i
know
she
exulted
rapturously
the
next
minute
she
was
down
at
pollyanna
side
again

me
now

and
answer
straight
and
true
she
urged
excitedly
it
was
after
he
found
out
you
was
miss
polly
niece
that
he
said
he
did
ever
want
ter
see
ye
again
it
oh
yes
i
told
him
that
the
last
time
i
saw
him
and
he
told
me
this
i
thought
as
much
triumphed
nancy
and
miss
polly
would
send
the
jelly
herself
would
she
and
you
told
him
she
did
send
it
why
yes
i
and
he
began
ter
act
queer
and
cry
out
sudden
after
he
found
out
you
was
her
niece
he
did
that
did
he
why
he
did
act
a
little
queer
over
that
jelly
admitted
pollyanna
with
a
thoughtful
frown
nancy
drew
a
long
sigh
then
i
got
it
sure
now
listen
john
pendleton
was
miss
polly
harrington
lover
she
announced
impressively
but
with
a
furtive
glance
over
her
shoulder
why
nancy
he
could
be
she
does
like
him
objected
pollyanna
nancy
gave
her
a
scornful
glance
of
course
she
do
that
the
quarrel
pollyanna
still
looked
incredulous
and
with
another
long
breath
nancy
happily
settled
herself
to
tell
the
story
it
like
this
just
before
you
come
tom
told
me
miss
polly
had
had
a
lover
once
i
did
believe
it
i
could
her
and
a
lover
but
tom
said
she
had
and
that
he
was
livin
now
right
in
this
town
and
now
i
know
of
course
it
john
pendleton
hai
he
got
a
mystery
in
his
life
do
he
shut
himself
up
in
that
grand
house
alone
and
never
speak
ter
no
one
did
he
act
queer
when
he
found
out
you
was
miss
polly
niece
and
now
hai
he
owned
up
that
you
remind
him
of
somethin
he
wants
ter
forget
just
as
if
anybody
could
see
was
miss
polly
an
her
sayin
she
would
send
him
no
jelly
too
why
miss
pollyanna
it
as
plain
as
the
nose
on
yer
face
it
is
it
is
breathed
pollyanna
in
amazement
but
nancy
i
should
think
if
they
loved
each
other
they
make
up
some
time
both
of
all
alone
so
all
these
years
i
should
think
they
be
glad
to
make
up
nancy
sniffed
disdainfully
i
guess
maybe
you
do
know
much
about
lovers
miss
pollyanna
you
ai
big
enough
yet
anyhow
but
if
there
is
a
set
o
folks
in
the
world
that
would
have
no
use
for
that
game
o
it
be
a
pair
o
quarrellin
lovers
and
that
what
they
be
ai
he
cross
as
sticks
most
and
ai
she
nancy
stopped
abruptly
remembering
just
in
time
to
whom
and
about
whom
she
was
speaking
suddenly
however
she
chuckled
i
ai
sayin
though
miss
pollyanna
but
what
it
would
be
a
pretty
slick
piece
of
business
if
you
could
get
ter
playin
it
so
they
would
be
glad
ter
make
up
but
my
land
would
folks
stare
some
miss
polly
and
him
i
guess
though
there
ai
much
chance
much
chance
pollyanna
said
nothing
but
when
she
went
into
the
house
a
little
later
her
face
was
very
thoughtful
chapter
xviii
prisms
as
the
warm
august
days
passed
pollyanna
went
very
frequently
to
the
great
house
on
pendleton
hill
she
did
not
feel
however
that
her
visits
were
really
a
success
not
but
that
the
man
seemed
to
want
her
there
he
sent
for
her
indeed
frequently
but
that
when
she
was
there
he
seemed
scarcely
any
the
happier
for
her
presence
at
least
so
pollyanna
thought
he
talked
to
her
it
was
true
and
he
showed
her
many
strange
and
beautiful
things
books
pictures
and
curios
but
he
still
fretted
audibly
over
his
own
helplessness
and
he
chafed
visibly
under
the
rules
and
regulatings
of
the
unwelcome
members
of
his
household
he
did
indeed
seem
to
like
to
hear
pollyanna
talk
however
and
pollyanna
talked
pollyanna
liked
to
talk
but
she
was
never
sure
that
she
would
not
look
up
and
find
him
lying
back
on
his
pillow
with
that
white
hurt
look
that
always
pained
her
and
she
was
never
sure
which
if
any
of
her
words
had
brought
it
there
as
for
telling
him
the
glad
game
and
trying
to
get
him
to
play
it
pollyanna
had
never
seen
the
time
yet
when
she
thought
he
would
care
to
hear
about
it
she
had
twice
tried
to
tell
him
but
neither
time
had
she
got
beyond
the
beginning
of
what
her
father
had
said
john
pendleton
had
on
each
occasion
turned
the
conversation
abruptly
to
another
subject
pollyanna
never
doubted
now
that
john
pendleton
was
her
aunt
lover
and
with
all
the
strength
of
her
loving
loyal
heart
she
wished
she
could
in
some
way
bring
happiness
into
their
to
her
mind
miserably
lonely
lives
just
how
she
was
to
do
this
however
she
could
not
see
she
talked
to
pendleton
about
her
aunt
and
he
listened
sometimes
politely
sometimes
irritably
frequently
with
a
quizzical
smile
on
his
usually
stern
lips
she
talked
to
her
aunt
about
pendleton
or
rather
she
tried
to
talk
to
her
about
him
as
a
general
thing
however
miss
polly
would
not
listen
long
she
always
found
something
else
to
talk
about
she
frequently
did
that
however
when
pollyanna
was
talking
of
others
of
chilton
for
instance
pollyanna
laid
this
though
to
the
fact
that
it
had
been
chilton
who
had
seen
her
in
the
sun
parlor
with
the
rose
in
her
hair
and
the
lace
shawl
draped
about
her
shoulders
aunt
polly
indeed
seemed
particularly
bitter
against
chilton
as
pollyanna
found
out
one
day
when
a
hard
cold
shut
her
up
in
the
house
if
you
are
not
better
by
night
i
shall
send
for
the
doctor
aunt
polly
said
shall
you
then
i
going
to
be
worse
gurgled
pollyanna
i
love
to
have
chilton
come
to
see
me
she
wondered
then
at
the
look
that
came
to
her
aunt
face
it
will
not
be
chilton
pollyanna
miss
polly
said
sternly
dr
chilton
is
not
our
family
physician
i
shall
send
for
warren
if
you
are
pollyanna
did
not
grow
worse
however
and
warren
was
not
summoned
and
i
so
glad
too
pollyanna
said
to
her
aunt
that
evening
of
course
i
like
warren
and
all
that
but
i
like
chilton
better
and
i
afraid
he
feel
hurt
if
i
did
have
him
you
see
he
really
to
blame
after
all
that
he
happened
to
see
you
when
i
dressed
you
up
so
pretty
that
day
aunt
polly
she
finished
wistfully
that
will
do
pollyanna
i
really
do
not
wish
to
discuss
chilton
or
his
feelings
reproved
miss
polly
decisively
pollyanna
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
with
mournfully
interested
eyes
then
she
sighed
i
just
love
to
see
you
when
your
cheeks
are
pink
like
that
aunt
polly
but
i
would
so
like
to
fix
your
hair
if
why
aunt
polly
but
her
aunt
was
already
out
of
sight
down
the
hall
it
was
toward
the
end
of
august
that
pollyanna
making
an
early
morning
call
on
john
pendleton
found
the
flaming
band
of
blue
and
gold
and
green
edged
with
red
and
violet
lying
across
his
pillow
she
stopped
short
in
awed
delight
why
pendleton
it
a
baby
rainbow
a
real
rainbow
come
in
to
pay
you
a
visit
she
exclaimed
clapping
her
hands
together
softly
oh
oh
oh
how
pretty
it
is
but
how
did
it
get
in
she
cried
the
man
laughed
a
little
grimly
john
pendleton
was
particularly
out
of
sorts
with
the
world
this
morning
well
i
suppose
it
in
through
the
bevelled
edge
of
that
glass
thermometer
in
the
window
he
said
wearily
the
sun
should
strike
it
at
all
but
it
does
in
the
oh
but
it
so
pretty
pendleton
and
does
just
the
sun
do
that
my
if
it
was
mine
i
have
it
hang
in
the
sun
all
day
long
lots
of
good
you
get
out
of
the
thermometer
then
laughed
the
man
how
do
you
suppose
you
could
tell
how
hot
it
was
or
how
cold
it
was
if
the
thermometer
hung
in
the
sun
all
day
i
should
care
breathed
pollyanna
her
fascinated
eyes
on
the
brilliant
band
of
colors
across
the
pillow
just
as
if
anybody
care
when
they
were
living
all
the
time
in
a
rainbow
the
man
laughed
he
was
watching
pollyanna
rapt
face
a
little
curiously
suddenly
a
new
thought
came
to
him
he
touched
the
bell
at
his
side
nora
he
said
when
the
elderly
maid
appeared
at
the
door
bring
me
one
of
the
big
brass
from
the
mantel
in
the
front
yes
sir
murmured
the
woman
looking
slightly
dazed
in
a
minute
she
had
returned
a
musical
tinkling
entered
the
room
with
her
as
she
advanced
wonderingly
toward
the
bed
it
came
from
the
prism
pendants
encircling
the
candelabrum
in
her
hand
thank
you
you
may
set
it
here
on
the
stand
directed
the
man
now
get
a
string
and
fasten
it
to
the
fixtures
of
that
window
there
take
down
the
and
let
the
string
reach
straight
across
the
window
from
side
to
side
that
will
be
all
thank
you
he
said
when
she
had
carried
out
his
directions
as
she
left
the
room
he
turned
smiling
eyes
toward
the
wondering
pollyanna
bring
me
the
candlestick
now
please
with
both
hands
she
brought
it
and
in
a
moment
he
was
slipping
off
the
pendants
one
by
one
until
they
lay
a
round
dozen
of
them
side
by
side
on
the
bed
now
my
dear
suppose
you
take
them
and
hook
them
to
that
little
string
nora
fixed
across
the
window
if
you
really
want
to
live
in
a
rainbow
i
do
see
but
we
have
to
have
a
rainbow
for
you
to
live
in
pollyanna
had
not
hung
up
three
of
the
pendants
in
the
sunlit
window
before
she
saw
a
little
of
what
was
going
to
happen
she
was
so
excited
then
she
could
scarcely
control
her
shaking
fingers
enough
to
hang
up
the
rest
but
at
last
her
task
was
finished
and
she
stepped
back
with
a
low
cry
of
delight
it
had
become
a
fairyland
that
sumptuous
but
dreary
bedroom
everywhere
were
bits
of
dancing
red
and
green
violet
and
orange
gold
and
blue
the
wall
the
floor
and
the
furniture
even
to
the
bed
itself
were
aflame
with
shimmering
bits
of
color
oh
oh
oh
how
lovely
breathed
pollyanna
then
she
laughed
suddenly
i
just
reckon
the
sun
himself
is
trying
to
play
the
game
now
you
she
cried
forgetting
for
the
moment
that
pendleton
could
not
know
what
she
was
talking
about
oh
how
i
wish
i
had
a
lot
of
those
things
how
i
would
like
to
give
them
to
aunt
polly
and
mrs
snow
and
lots
of
folks
i
reckon
then
they
be
glad
all
right
why
i
think
even
aunt
polly
get
so
glad
she
could
help
banging
doors
if
she
lived
in
a
rainbow
like
that
do
you
pendleton
laughed
well
from
my
remembrance
of
your
aunt
miss
pollyanna
i
must
say
i
think
it
would
take
something
more
than
a
few
prisms
in
the
sunlight
to
to
make
her
bang
many
doors
for
gladness
but
come
now
really
what
do
you
mean
pollyanna
stared
slightly
then
she
drew
a
long
breath
oh
i
forgot
you
do
know
about
the
game
i
remember
suppose
you
tell
me
and
this
time
pollyanna
told
him
she
told
him
the
whole
thing
from
the
very
first
from
the
crutches
that
should
have
been
a
doll
as
she
talked
she
did
not
look
at
his
face
her
rapt
eyes
were
still
on
the
dancing
flecks
of
color
from
the
prism
pendants
swaying
in
the
sunlit
window
and
that
all
she
sighed
when
she
had
finished
and
now
you
know
why
i
said
the
sun
was
trying
to
play
it
that
for
a
moment
there
was
silence
then
a
low
voice
from
the
bed
said
unsteadily
perhaps
but
i
thinking
that
the
very
finest
prism
of
them
all
is
yourself
oh
but
i
do
show
beautiful
red
and
green
and
purple
when
the
sun
shines
through
me
pendleton
do
you
smiled
the
man
and
pollyanna
looking
into
his
face
wondered
why
there
were
tears
in
his
eyes
no
she
said
then
after
a
minute
she
added
mournfully
i
afraid
pendleton
the
sun
does
make
anything
but
freckles
out
of
me
aunt
polly
says
it
does
make
them
the
man
laughed
a
little
and
again
pollyanna
looked
at
him
the
laugh
had
sounded
almost
like
a
sob
chapter
xix
which
is
somewhat
surprising
pollyanna
entered
school
in
september
preliminary
examinations
showed
that
she
was
well
advanced
for
a
girl
of
her
years
and
she
was
soon
a
happy
member
of
a
class
of
girls
and
boys
her
own
age
school
in
some
ways
was
a
surprise
to
pollyanna
and
pollyanna
certainly
in
many
ways
was
very
much
of
a
surprise
to
school
they
were
soon
on
the
best
of
terms
however
and
to
her
aunt
pollyanna
confessed
that
going
to
school
was
living
after
all
though
she
had
had
her
doubts
before
in
spite
of
her
delight
in
her
new
work
pollyanna
did
not
forget
her
old
friends
true
she
could
not
give
them
quite
so
much
time
now
of
course
but
she
gave
them
what
time
she
could
perhaps
john
pendleton
of
them
all
however
was
the
most
dissatisfied
one
saturday
afternoon
he
spoke
to
her
about
it
see
here
pollyanna
how
would
you
like
to
come
and
live
with
me
he
asked
a
little
impatiently
i
do
see
anything
of
you
pollyanna
laughed
pendleton
was
such
a
funny
man
i
thought
you
did
like
to
have
folks
she
said
he
made
a
wry
face
oh
but
that
was
before
you
taught
me
to
play
that
wonderful
game
of
yours
now
i
glad
to
be
waited
on
hand
and
foot
never
mind
be
on
my
own
two
feet
yet
one
of
these
days
then
i
see
who
steps
around
he
finished
picking
up
one
of
the
crutches
at
his
side
and
shaking
it
playfully
at
the
little
girl
they
were
sitting
in
the
great
library
oh
but
you
are
really
glad
at
all
for
things
you
just
say
you
are
pouted
pollyanna
her
eyes
on
the
dog
dozing
before
the
fire
you
know
you
do
play
the
game
right
ever
pendleton
you
know
you
do
the
man
face
grew
suddenly
very
grave
that
why
i
want
you
little
girl
to
help
me
play
it
will
you
come
pollyanna
turned
in
surprise
mr
pendleton
you
do
really
mean
that
but
i
do
i
want
you
will
you
come
pollyanna
looked
distressed
why
pendleton
i
ca
you
know
i
ca
why
i
aunt
polly
a
quick
something
crossed
the
man
face
that
pollyanna
could
not
quite
understand
his
head
came
up
almost
fiercely
you
no
more
hers
than
perhaps
she
would
let
you
come
to
me
he
finished
more
gently
would
you
come
if
she
did
pollyanna
frowned
in
deep
thought
but
aunt
polly
has
been
so
good
to
me
she
began
slowly
and
she
took
me
when
i
did
have
anybody
left
but
the
ladies
aid
and
again
that
spasm
of
something
crossed
the
man
face
but
this
time
when
he
spoke
his
voice
was
low
and
very
sad
pollyanna
long
years
ago
i
loved
somebody
very
much
i
hoped
to
bring
her
some
day
to
this
house
i
pictured
how
happy
we
be
together
in
our
home
all
the
long
years
to
yes
pitied
pollyanna
her
eyes
shining
with
sympathy
but
well
i
did
bring
her
here
never
mind
why
i
just
that
all
and
ever
since
then
this
great
gray
pile
of
stone
has
been
a
house
never
a
home
it
takes
a
woman
hand
and
heart
or
a
presence
to
make
a
home
pollyanna
and
i
have
not
had
either
now
will
you
come
my
dear
pollyanna
sprang
to
her
feet
her
face
was
fairly
illumined
mr
pendleton
you
you
mean
that
you
wish
you
you
had
had
that
woman
hand
and
heart
all
this
time
why
oh
i
so
glad
then
it
all
right
sighed
the
little
girl
now
you
can
take
us
both
and
everything
will
be
take
you
both
repeated
the
man
dazedly
a
faint
doubt
crossed
pollyanna
countenance
well
of
course
aunt
polly
is
won
over
yet
but
i
sure
she
will
be
if
you
tell
it
to
her
just
as
you
did
to
me
and
then
we
both
come
of
a
look
of
actual
terror
leaped
to
the
man
eyes
aunt
polly
come
here
pollyanna
eyes
widened
a
little
would
you
rather
go
there
she
asked
of
course
the
house
is
quite
so
pretty
but
it
nearer
pollyanna
what
are
you
talking
about
asked
the
man
very
gently
now
why
about
where
we
going
to
live
of
course
rejoined
pollyanna
in
obvious
surprise
i
thought
you
meant
here
at
first
you
said
it
was
here
that
you
had
wanted
aunt
polly
hand
and
heart
all
these
years
to
make
a
home
and
an
inarticulate
cry
came
from
the
man
throat
he
raised
his
hand
and
began
to
speak
but
the
next
moment
he
dropped
his
hand
nervelessly
at
his
side
the
doctor
sir
said
the
maid
in
the
doorway
pollyanna
rose
at
once
john
pendleton
turned
to
her
feverishly
pollyanna
for
heaven
sake
say
nothing
of
what
i
asked
you
yet
he
begged
in
a
low
voice
pollyanna
dimpled
into
a
sunny
smile
of
course
not
just
as
if
i
did
know
you
rather
tell
her
yourself
she
called
back
merrily
over
her
shoulder
john
pendleton
fell
limply
back
in
his
chair
why
what
up
demanded
the
doctor
a
minute
later
his
fingers
on
his
patient
galloping
pulse
a
whimsical
smile
trembled
on
john
pendleton
lips
overdose
of
your
tonic
i
guess
he
laughed
as
he
noted
the
eyes
following
pollyanna
little
figure
down
the
driveway
chapter
xx
which
is
more
surprising
sunday
mornings
pollyanna
usually
attended
church
and
sunday
school
sunday
afternoons
she
frequently
went
for
a
walk
with
nancy
she
had
planned
one
for
the
day
after
her
saturday
afternoon
visit
to
john
pendleton
but
on
the
way
home
from
sunday
school
chilton
overtook
her
in
his
gig
and
brought
his
horse
to
a
stop
suppose
you
let
me
drive
you
home
pollyanna
he
suggested
i
want
to
speak
to
you
a
minute
i
was
just
driving
out
to
your
place
to
tell
you
he
went
on
as
pollyanna
settled
herself
at
his
side
mr
pendleton
sent
a
special
request
for
you
to
go
to
see
him
this
afternoon
sure
he
says
it
very
pollyanna
nodded
happily
yes
it
is
i
know
i
the
doctor
eyed
her
with
some
surprise
i
not
sure
i
shall
let
you
after
all
he
declared
his
eyes
twinkling
you
seemed
more
upsetting
than
soothing
yesterday
young
pollyanna
laughed
oh
it
was
me
truly
not
really
you
know
not
so
much
as
it
was
aunt
the
doctor
turned
with
a
quick
start
your
aunt
he
ejaculated
pollyanna
gave
a
happy
little
bounce
in
her
seat
yes
and
it
so
exciting
and
lovely
just
like
a
story
you
know
i
i
going
to
tell
you
she
burst
out
with
sudden
decision
he
said
not
to
mention
it
but
he
would
mind
your
knowing
of
course
he
meant
not
to
mention
it
to
her
yes
aunt
polly
and
of
course
he
would
want
to
tell
her
himself
instead
of
having
me
do
it
lovers
so
lovers
as
the
doctor
said
the
word
the
horse
started
violently
as
if
the
hand
that
held
the
reins
had
given
them
a
sharp
jerk
yes
nodded
pollyanna
happily
that
the
you
see
i
did
know
it
till
nancy
told
me
she
said
aunt
polly
had
a
lover
years
ago
and
they
quarrelled
she
did
know
who
it
was
at
first
but
found
out
now
it
pendleton
you
the
doctor
relaxed
suddenly
the
hand
holding
the
reins
fell
limply
to
his
lap
oh
no
i
did
know
he
said
quietly
pollyanna
hurried
on
they
were
nearing
the
harrington
homestead
yes
and
i
so
glad
now
it
come
out
lovely
pendleton
asked
me
to
come
and
live
with
him
but
of
course
i
would
leave
aunt
polly
like
that
after
she
been
so
good
to
me
then
he
told
me
all
about
the
woman
hand
and
heart
that
he
used
to
want
and
i
found
out
that
he
wanted
it
now
and
i
was
so
glad
for
of
course
if
he
wants
to
make
up
the
quarrel
everything
will
be
all
right
now
and
aunt
polly
and
i
will
both
go
to
live
there
or
else
he
come
to
live
with
us
of
course
aunt
polly
does
know
yet
and
we
have
got
everything
settled
so
i
suppose
that
is
why
he
wanted
to
see
me
this
afternoon
the
doctor
sat
suddenly
erect
there
was
an
odd
smile
on
his
lips
yes
i
can
well
imagine
that
john
pendleton
does
want
to
see
you
pollyanna
he
nodded
as
he
pulled
his
horse
to
a
stop
before
the
door
there
aunt
polly
now
in
the
window
cried
pollyanna
then
a
second
later
why
no
she
is
but
i
thought
i
saw
her
no
she
is
there
now
said
the
doctor
his
lips
had
suddenly
lost
their
smile
pollyanna
found
a
very
nervous
john
pendleton
waiting
for
her
that
afternoon
pollyanna
he
began
at
once
i
been
trying
all
night
to
puzzle
out
what
you
meant
by
all
that
yesterday
about
my
wanting
your
aunt
polly
hand
and
heart
here
all
those
years
what
did
you
mean
why
because
you
were
lovers
you
know
once
and
i
was
so
glad
you
still
felt
that
way
lovers
your
aunt
polly
and
i
at
the
obvious
surprise
in
the
man
voice
pollyanna
opened
wide
her
eyes
why
pendleton
nancy
said
you
were
the
man
gave
a
short
little
laugh
indeed
well
i
afraid
i
shall
have
to
say
that
nancy
did
then
you
were
lovers
pollyanna
voice
was
tragic
with
dismay
never
and
it
is
all
coming
out
like
a
book
there
was
no
answer
the
man
eyes
were
moodily
fixed
out
the
window
o
dear
and
it
was
all
going
so
splendidly
almost
sobbed
pollyanna
i
have
been
so
glad
to
come
with
aunt
and
you
wo
now
the
man
asked
the
question
without
turning
his
head
of
course
not
i
aunt
the
man
turned
now
almost
fiercely
before
you
were
hers
pollyanna
you
were
your
mother
and
it
was
your
mother
hand
and
heart
that
i
wanted
long
years
my
mother
yes
i
had
not
meant
to
tell
you
but
perhaps
it
better
after
all
that
i
do
john
pendleton
face
had
grown
very
white
he
was
speaking
with
evident
difficulty
pollyanna
her
eyes
wide
and
frightened
and
her
lips
parted
was
gazing
at
him
fixedly
i
loved
your
mother
but
she
did
love
me
and
after
a
time
she
went
away
with
your
father
i
did
not
know
until
then
how
much
i
did
care
the
whole
world
suddenly
seemed
to
turn
black
under
my
fingers
and
but
never
mind
for
long
years
i
have
been
a
cross
crabbed
unlovable
unloved
old
man
though
i
not
nearly
sixty
yet
pollyanna
then
one
day
like
one
of
the
prisms
that
you
love
so
well
little
girl
you
danced
into
my
life
and
flecked
my
dreary
old
world
with
dashes
of
the
purple
and
gold
and
scarlet
of
your
own
bright
cheeriness
i
found
out
after
a
time
who
you
were
and
and
i
thought
then
i
never
wanted
to
see
you
again
i
did
want
to
be
reminded
of
your
mother
but
you
know
how
that
came
out
i
just
had
to
have
you
come
and
now
i
want
you
always
pollyanna
wo
you
come
now
but
pendleton
i
there
aunt
polly
pollyanna
eyes
were
blurred
with
tears
the
man
made
an
impatient
gesture
what
about
me
how
do
you
suppose
i
going
to
be
about
anything
without
you
why
pollyanna
it
only
since
you
came
that
i
been
even
half
glad
to
live
but
if
i
had
you
for
my
own
little
girl
i
be
glad
for
anything
and
i
try
to
make
you
glad
too
my
dear
you
should
have
a
wish
ungratified
all
my
money
to
the
last
cent
should
go
to
make
you
pollyanna
looked
shocked
why
pendleton
as
if
i
let
you
spend
it
on
me
all
that
money
you
saved
for
the
heathen
a
dull
red
came
to
the
man
face
he
started
to
speak
but
pollyanna
was
still
talking
besides
anybody
with
such
a
lot
of
money
as
you
have
does
need
me
to
make
you
glad
about
things
you
making
other
folks
so
glad
giving
them
things
that
you
just
ca
help
being
glad
yourself
why
look
at
those
prisms
you
gave
mrs
snow
and
me
and
the
gold
piece
you
gave
nancy
on
her
birthday
and
yes
yes
never
mind
about
all
that
interrupted
the
man
his
face
was
very
very
red
now
and
no
wonder
perhaps
it
was
not
for
giving
things
that
john
pendleton
had
been
best
known
in
the
past
that
all
nonsense
was
much
anyhow
but
what
there
was
was
because
of
you
you
gave
those
things
not
i
yes
you
did
he
repeated
in
answer
to
the
shocked
denial
in
her
face
and
that
only
goes
to
prove
all
the
more
how
i
need
you
little
girl
he
added
his
voice
softening
into
tender
pleading
once
more
if
ever
ever
i
am
to
play
the
game
pollyanna
you
have
to
come
and
play
it
with
the
little
girl
forehead
puckered
into
a
wistful
frown
aunt
polly
has
been
so
good
to
me
she
began
but
the
man
interrupted
her
sharply
the
old
irritability
had
come
back
to
his
face
impatience
which
would
brook
no
opposition
had
been
a
part
of
john
nature
too
long
to
yield
very
easily
now
to
restraint
of
course
she
been
good
to
you
but
she
does
want
you
warrant
half
so
much
as
i
do
he
contested
why
pendleton
she
glad
i
know
to
have
glad
interrupted
the
man
thoroughly
losing
his
patience
now
wager
miss
polly
does
know
how
to
be
glad
for
anything
oh
she
does
her
duty
i
know
she
a
very
dutiful
woman
i
had
experience
with
her
before
i
acknowledge
we
have
been
the
best
of
friends
for
the
last
fifteen
or
twenty
years
but
i
know
her
every
one
knows
her
and
she
is
the
kind
pollyanna
she
does
know
how
to
be
as
for
your
coming
to
me
you
just
ask
her
and
see
if
she
wo
let
you
come
and
oh
little
girl
little
girl
i
want
you
so
he
finished
brokenly
pollyanna
rose
to
her
feet
with
a
long
sigh
all
right
i
ask
her
she
said
wistfully
of
course
i
do
mean
that
i
would
like
to
live
here
with
you
pendleton
but
she
did
not
complete
her
sentence
there
was
a
moment
silence
then
she
added
well
anyhow
i
glad
i
did
tell
her
yesterday
then
i
supposed
she
was
wanted
john
pendleton
smiled
grimly
well
yes
pollyanna
i
guess
it
is
just
as
well
you
did
mention
it
i
did
only
to
the
doctor
and
of
course
he
does
the
doctor
cried
john
pendleton
turning
quickly
not
chilton
yes
when
he
came
to
tell
me
you
wanted
to
see
me
you
well
of
all
the
muttered
the
man
falling
back
in
his
chair
then
he
sat
up
with
sudden
interest
and
what
did
chilton
say
he
asked
pollyanna
frowned
thoughtfully
why
i
do
remember
not
much
i
reckon
oh
he
did
say
he
could
well
imagine
you
did
want
to
see
oh
did
he
indeed
answered
john
pendleton
and
pollyanna
wondered
why
he
gave
that
sudden
queer
little
laugh
chapter
xxi
a
question
answered
the
sky
was
darkening
fast
with
what
appeared
to
be
an
approaching
thunder
shower
when
pollyanna
hurried
down
the
hill
from
john
pendleton
house
home
she
met
nancy
with
an
umbrella
by
that
time
however
the
clouds
had
shifted
their
position
and
the
shower
was
not
so
imminent
guess
it
goin
ter
the
north
announced
nancy
eyeing
the
sky
critically
i
thought
was
all
the
time
but
miss
polly
wanted
me
ter
come
with
this
she
was
worried
about
ye
was
she
murmured
pollyanna
abstractedly
eyeing
the
clouds
in
her
turn
nancy
sniffed
a
little
you
do
seem
ter
notice
what
i
said
she
observed
aggrievedly
i
said
yer
aunt
was
worried
about
ye
oh
sighed
pollyanna
remembering
suddenly
the
question
she
was
so
soon
to
ask
her
aunt
i
sorry
i
did
mean
to
scare
well
i
glad
retorted
nancy
unexpectedly
i
am
i
pollyanna
stared
glad
that
aunt
polly
was
scared
about
me
why
nancy
that
is
the
way
to
play
the
game
to
be
glad
for
things
like
that
she
objected
there
no
game
in
it
retorted
nancy
never
thought
of
it
you
do
seem
ter
sense
what
it
means
ter
have
miss
polly
worried
about
ye
child
why
it
means
worried
and
worried
is
horrid
to
feel
maintained
pollyanna
what
else
can
it
mean
nancy
tossed
her
head
well
i
tell
ye
what
it
means
it
means
she
at
last
gettin
down
somewheres
near
human
like
folks
an
that
she
ai
jest
doin
her
duty
by
ye
all
the
why
nancy
demurred
the
scandalized
pollyanna
aunt
polly
always
does
her
duty
she
she
a
very
dutiful
woman
unconsciously
pollyanna
repeated
john
pendleton
words
of
half
an
hour
before
nancy
chuckled
you
right
she
is
and
she
always
was
i
guess
but
she
more
now
since
you
pollyanna
face
changed
her
brows
drew
into
a
troubled
frown
there
that
what
i
was
going
to
ask
you
nancy
she
sighed
do
you
think
aunt
polly
likes
to
have
me
here
would
she
mind
if
if
i
here
any
more
nancy
threw
a
quick
look
into
the
little
girl
absorbed
face
she
had
expected
to
be
asked
this
question
long
before
and
she
had
dreaded
it
she
had
wondered
how
she
should
answer
it
how
she
could
answer
it
honestly
without
cruelly
hurting
the
questioner
but
now
now
in
the
face
of
the
new
suspicions
that
had
become
convictions
by
the
afternoon
nancy
only
welcomed
the
question
with
open
arms
she
was
sure
that
with
a
clean
conscience
she
could
set
the
little
girl
heart
at
rest
likes
ter
have
ye
here
would
she
miss
ye
if
ye
here
cried
nancy
indignantly
as
if
that
jest
what
i
was
tellin
of
ye
did
she
send
me
posthaste
with
an
umbrella
she
see
a
little
cloud
in
the
sky
did
she
make
me
tote
yer
things
all
so
you
could
have
the
pretty
room
you
wanted
why
miss
pollyanna
when
ye
remember
how
at
first
she
hated
ter
have
with
a
choking
cough
nancy
pulled
herself
up
just
in
time
and
it
ai
jest
things
i
can
put
my
fingers
on

rushed
on
nancy
breathlessly
it
little
ways
she
has
that
shows
how
been
softenin
her
up
an
mellerin
her
down
the
cat
and
the
dog
and
the
way
she
speaks
ter
me
and
oh
lots
o
things
why
miss
pollyanna
there
ai
no
tellin
how
she
miss
ye
if
ye
here
finished
nancy
speaking
with
an
enthusiastic
certainty
that
was
meant
to
hide
the
perilous
admission
she
had
almost
made
before
even
then
she
was
not
quite
prepared
for
the
sudden
joy
that
illumined
pollyanna
face
oh
nancy
i
so
glad
glad
glad
you
do
know
how
glad
i
am
that
aunt
polly
wants
me
as
if
i
leave
her
now
thought
pollyanna
as
she
climbed
the
stairs
to
her
room
a
little
later
i
always
knew
i
wanted
to
live
with
aunt
polly
but
i
reckon
maybe
i
did
know
quite
how
much
i
wanted
aunt
polly
to
want
to
live
with
me
the
task
of
telling
john
pendleton
of
her
decision
would
not
be
an
easy
one
pollyanna
knew
and
she
dreaded
it
she
was
very
fond
of
john
pendleton
and
she
was
very
sorry
for
him
because
he
seemed
to
be
so
sorry
for
himself
she
was
sorry
too
for
the
long
lonely
life
that
had
made
him
so
unhappy
and
she
was
grieved
that
it
had
been
because
of
her
mother
that
he
had
spent
those
dreary
years
she
pictured
the
great
gray
house
as
it
would
be
after
its
master
was
well
again
with
its
silent
rooms
its
littered
floors
its
disordered
desk
and
her
heart
ached
for
his
loneliness
she
wished
that
somewhere
some
one
might
be
found
who
and
it
was
at
this
point
that
she
sprang
to
her
feet
with
a
little
cry
of
joy
at
the
thought
that
had
come
to
her
as
soon
as
she
could
after
that
she
hurried
up
the
hill
to
john
pendleton
house
and
in
due
time
she
found
herself
in
the
great
dim
library
with
john
pendleton
himself
sitting
near
her
his
long
thin
hands
lying
idle
on
the
arms
of
his
chair
and
his
faithful
little
dog
at
his
feet
well
pollyanna
is
it
to
be
the
game
with
me
all
the
rest
of
my
life
asked
the
man
gently
oh
yes
cried
pollyanna
i
thought
of
the
very
gladdest
kind
of
a
thing
for
you
to
do
and
with
you
asked
john
pendleton
his
mouth
growing
a
little
stern
at
the
corners
but
pollyanna
you
are
going
to
say
no
interrupted
a
voice
deep
with
emotion
i
i
got
to
pendleton
truly
i
have
aunt
polly
did
she
refuse
to
let
you
come
i
i
did
ask
her
stammered
the
little
girl
miserably
pollyanna
pollyanna
turned
away
her
eyes
she
could
not
meet
the
hurt
grieved
gaze
of
her
friend
so
you
did
even
ask
her
i
could
sir
truly
faltered
pollyanna
you
see
i
found
out
without
asking
aunt
polly
wants
me
with
her
and
and
i
want
to
stay
too
she
confessed
bravely
you
do
know
how
good
she
been
to
me
and
and
i
think
really
sometimes
she
beginning
to
be
glad
about
things
lots
of
things
and
you
know
she
never
used
to
be
you
said
it
yourself
oh
pendleton
i
could
leave
aunt
polly
now
there
was
a
long
pause
only
the
snapping
of
the
wood
fire
in
the
grate
broke
the
silence
at
last
however
the
man
spoke
no
pollyanna
i
see
you
could
leave
her
now
he
said
i
ask
you
the
last
word
was
so
low
it
was
almost
inaudible
but
pollyanna
heard
oh
but
you
do
know
about
the
rest
of
it
she
reminded
him
eagerly
there
the
very
gladdest
thing
you
can
do
truly
there
is
not
for
me
yes
sir
for
you
you
said
it
you
said
only
a
a
woman
hand
and
heart
or
a
child
presence
could
make
a
home
and
i
can
get
it
for
you
a
child
presence
not
me
you
know
but
another
as
if
i
would
have
any
but
you
resented
an
indignant
voice
but
you
will
when
you
know
you
so
kind
and
good
why
think
of
the
prisms
and
the
gold
pieces
and
all
that
money
you
save
for
the
heathen
and
pollyanna
interrupted
the
man
savagely
once
for
all
let
us
end
that
nonsense
i
tried
to
tell
you
half
a
dozen
times
before
there
is
no
money
for
the
heathen
i
never
sent
a
penny
to
them
in
my
life
there
he
lifted
his
chin
and
braced
himself
to
meet
what
he
expected
the
grieved
disappointment
of
pollyanna
eyes
to
his
amazement
however
there
was
neither
grief
nor
disappointment
in
pollyanna
eyes
there
was
only
surprised
joy
oh
oh
she
cried
clapping
her
hands
i
so
glad
that
is
she
corrected
coloring
distressfully
i
do
mean
that
i
not
sorry
for
the
heathen
only
just
now
i
ca
help
being
glad
that
you
do
want
the
little
india
boys
because
all
the
rest
have
wanted
them
and
so
glad
you
rather
have
jimmy
bean
now
i
know
you
take
him
take
who
jimmy
bean
he
the
presence
you
know
and
he
be
so
glad
to
be
it
i
had
to
tell
him
last
week
that
even
my
ladies
aid
out
west
would
take
him
and
he
was
so
disappointed
but
now
when
he
hears
of
this
he
be
so
glad
will
he
well
i
wo
ejaculated
the
man
decisively
pollyanna
this
is
sheer
nonsense
you
do
mean
you
wo
take
him
i
certainly
do
mean
just
but
he
be
a
lovely
child
presence
faltered
pollyanna
she
was
almost
crying
now
and
you
could
be
lonesome
with
jimmy
i
do
doubt
it
rejoined
the
man
but
i
think
i
prefer
the
it
was
then
that
pollyanna
for
the
first
time
in
weeks
suddenly
remembered
something
nancy
had
once
told
her
she
raised
her
chin
aggrievedly
maybe
you
think
a
nice
live
little
boy
would
be
better
than
that
old
dead
skeleton
you
keep
somewhere
but
i
think
it
would
skeleton
yes
nancy
said
you
had
one
in
your
closet
why
what
suddenly
the
man
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
he
laughed
very
heartily
indeed
so
heartily
that
pollyanna
began
to
cry
from
pure
nervousness
when
he
saw
that
john
pendleton
sat
erect
very
promptly
his
face
grew
grave
at
once
pollyanna
i
suspect
you
are
right
more
right
than
you
know
he
said
gently
in
fact
i
know
that
a
live
little
boy
would
be
far
better
than
my
skeleton
in
the
closet
only
we
are
always
willing
to
make
the
exchange
we
are
apt
to
still
cling
to
our
skeletons
pollyanna
however
suppose
you
tell
me
a
little
more
about
this
nice
little
and
pollyanna
told
him
perhaps
the
laugh
cleared
the
air
or
perhaps
the
pathos
of
jimmy
story
as
told
by
pollyanna
eager
little
lips
touched
a
heart
already
strangely
softened
at
all
events
when
pollyanna
went
home
that
night
she
carried
with
her
an
invitation
for
jimmy
bean
himself
to
call
at
the
great
house
with
pollyanna
the
next
saturday
afternoon
and
i
so
glad
and
i
sure
you
like
him
sighed
pollyanna
as
she
said
i
do
so
want
jimmy
bean
to
have
a
home
and
folks
that
care
you
chapter
xxii
sermons
and
woodboxes
on
the
afternoon
that
pollyanna
told
john
pendleton
of
jimmy
bean
the
rev
paul
ford
climbed
the
hill
and
entered
the
pendleton
woods
hoping
that
the
hushed
beauty
of
god
would
still
the
tumult
that
his
children
of
men
had
wrought
the
rev
paul
ford
was
sick
at
heart
month
by
month
for
a
year
past
conditions
in
the
parish
under
him
had
been
growing
worse
and
worse
until
it
seemed
that
now
turn
which
way
he
would
he
encountered
only
wrangling
backbiting
scandal
and
jealousy
he
had
argued
pleaded
rebuked
and
ignored
by
turns
and
always
and
through
all
he
had
prayed
earnestly
hopefully
but
miserably
he
was
forced
to
own
that
matters
were
no
better
but
rather
worse
two
of
his
deacons
were
at
swords
points
over
a
silly
something
that
only
endless
brooding
had
made
of
any
account
three
of
his
most
energetic
women
workers
had
withdrawn
from
the
ladies
aid
society
because
a
tiny
spark
of
gossip
had
been
fanned
by
wagging
tongues
into
a
devouring
flame
of
scandal
the
choir
had
split
over
the
amount
of
solo
work
given
to
a
fanciedly
preferred
singer
even
the
christian
endeavor
society
was
in
a
ferment
of
unrest
owing
to
open
criticism
of
two
of
its
officers
as
to
the
sunday
school
it
had
been
the
resignation
of
its
superintendent
and
two
of
its
teachers
that
had
been
the
last
straw
and
that
had
sent
the
harassed
minister
to
the
quiet
woods
for
prayer
and
meditation
under
the
green
arch
of
the
trees
the
rev
paul
ford
faced
the
thing
squarely
to
his
mind
the
crisis
had
come
something
must
be
done
and
done
at
once
the
entire
work
of
the
church
was
at
a
standstill
the
sunday
services
the
prayer
meeting
the
missionary
teas
even
the
suppers
and
socials
were
becoming
less
and
less
well
attended
true
a
few
conscientious
workers
were
still
left
but
they
pulled
at
cross
purposes
usually
and
always
they
showed
themselves
to
be
acutely
aware
of
the
critical
eyes
all
about
them
and
of
the
tongues
that
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
talk
about
what
the
eyes
saw
and
because
of
all
this
the
rev
paul
ford
understood
very
well
that
he
god
minister
the
church
the
town
and
even
christianity
itself
was
suffering
and
must
suffer
still
more
unless
clearly
something
must
be
done
and
done
at
once
but
what
slowly
the
minister
took
from
his
pocket
the
notes
he
had
made
for
his
next
sunday
sermon
frowningly
he
looked
at
them
his
mouth
settled
into
stern
lines
as
aloud
very
impressively
he
read
the
verses
on
which
he
had
determined
to
speak
woe
unto
you
scribes
and
pharisees
hypocrites
for
ye
shut
up
the
kingdom
of
heaven
against
men
for
ye
neither
go
in
yourselves
neither
suffer
ye
them
that
are
entering
to
go
in
unto
you
scribes
and
pharisees
hypocrites
for
ye
devour
widows
houses
and
for
a
pretence
make
long
prayer
therefore
ye
shall
receive
the
greater
damnation
unto
you
scribes
and
pharisees
hypocrites
for
ye
pay
tithe
of
mint
and
anise
and
cummin
and
have
omitted
the
weightier
matters
of
the
law
judgment
mercy
and
faith
these
ought
ye
to
have
done
and
not
to
leave
the
other
undone
it
was
a
bitter
denunciation
in
the
green
aisles
of
the
woods
the
minister
deep
voice
rang
out
with
scathing
effect
even
the
birds
and
squirrels
seemed
hushed
into
awed
silence
it
brought
to
the
minister
a
vivid
realization
of
how
those
words
would
sound
the
next
sunday
when
he
should
utter
them
before
his
people
in
the
sacred
hush
of
the
church
his
people
they
were
his
people
could
he
do
it
dare
he
do
it
dare
he
not
do
it
it
was
a
fearful
denunciation
even
without
the
words
that
would
follow
his
own
words
he
had
prayed
and
prayed
he
had
pleaded
earnestly
for
help
for
guidance
he
longed
oh
how
earnestly
he
longed
to
take
now
in
this
crisis
the
right
step
but
was
this
the
right
step
slowly
the
minister
folded
the
papers
and
thrust
them
back
into
his
pocket
then
with
a
sigh
that
was
almost
a
moan
he
flung
himself
down
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
it
was
there
that
pollyanna
on
her
way
home
from
the
pendleton
house
found
him
with
a
little
cry
she
ran
forward
oh
oh
ford
you
you
have
broken
your
leg
or
or
anything
have
you
she
gasped
the
minister
dropped
his
hands
and
looked
up
quickly
he
tried
to
smile
no
dear
no
indeed
i
just
oh
sighed
pollyanna
falling
back
a
little
that
all
right
then
you
see
pendleton
had
broken
his
leg
when
i
found
him
but
he
was
lying
down
though
and
you
are
sitting
yes
i
am
sitting
up
and
i
have
broken
anything
that
doctors
can
the
last
words
were
very
low
but
pollyanna
heard
them
a
swift
change
crossed
her
face
her
eyes
glowed
with
tender
sympathy
i
know
what
you
mean
something
plagues
you
father
used
to
feel
like
that
lots
of
times
i
reckon
ministers
do
most
generally
you
see
there
such
a
lot
depends
on
the
rev
paul
ford
turned
a
little
wonderingly
was
your
father
a
minister
pollyanna
yes
sir
did
you
know
i
supposed
everybody
knew
that
he
married
aunt
polly
sister
and
she
was
my
oh
i
understand
but
you
see
i
have
been
here
many
years
so
i
do
know
all
the
family
yes
sir
i
mean
no
sir
smiled
pollyanna
there
was
a
long
pause
the
minister
still
sitting
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
appeared
to
have
forgotten
pollyanna
presence
he
had
pulled
some
papers
from
his
pocket
and
unfolded
them
but
he
was
not
looking
at
them
he
was
gazing
instead
at
a
leaf
on
the
ground
a
little
distance
away
and
it
was
not
even
a
pretty
leaf
it
was
brown
and
dead
pollyanna
looking
at
him
felt
vaguely
sorry
for
him
it
it
a
nice
day
she
began
hopefully
for
a
moment
there
was
no
answer
then
the
minister
looked
up
with
a
start
what
oh
yes
it
is
a
very
nice
and
is
cold
at
all
either
even
if
is
october
observed
pollyanna
still
more
hopefully
mr
pendleton
had
a
fire
but
he
said
he
did
need
it
it
was
just
to
look
at
i
like
to
look
at
fires
do
you
there
was
no
reply
this
time
though
pollyanna
waited
patiently
before
she
tried
again
by
a
new
route
do
you
like
being
a
minister
the
rev
paul
ford
looked
up
now
very
quickly
do
i
like
why
what
an
odd
question
why
do
you
ask
that
my
dear
nothing
only
the
way
you
looked
it
made
me
think
of
my
father
he
used
to
look
like
that
did
he
the
minister
voice
was
polite
but
his
eyes
had
gone
back
to
the
dried
leaf
on
the
ground
yes
and
i
used
to
ask
him
just
as
i
did
you
if
he
was
glad
he
was
a
the
man
under
the
tree
smiled
a
little
sadly
well
what
did
he
say
oh
he
always
said
he
was
of
course
but
always
he
said
too
that
he
would
stay
a
minister
a
minute
if
was
for
the
rejoicing
the
what
the
rev
paul
ford
eyes
left
the
leaf
and
gazed
wonderingly
into
pollyanna
merry
little
face
well
that
what
father
used
to
call
she
laughed
of
course
the
bible
did
name
that
but
it
all
those
that
begin
glad
in
the
lord
or
greatly
or
for
joy
and
all
that
you
know
such
a
lot
of
once
when
father
felt
specially
bad
he
counted
there
were
eight
hundred
of
eight
hundred
yes
that
told
you
to
rejoice
and
be
glad
you
know
that
why
father
named
the
texts
oh
there
was
an
odd
look
on
the
minister
face
his
eyes
had
fallen
to
the
words
on
the
top
paper
in
his
hands
but
woe
unto
you
scribes
and
pharisees
hypocrites
and
so
your
father
liked
those
texts
he
murmured
oh
yes
nodded
pollyanna
emphatically
he
said
he
felt
better
right
away
that
first
day
he
thought
to
count
he
said
if
god
took
the
trouble
to
tell
us
eight
hundred
times
to
be
glad
and
rejoice
he
must
want
us
to
do
it
some
and
father
felt
ashamed
that
he
had
done
it
more
after
that
they
got
to
be
such
a
comfort
to
him
you
know
when
things
went
wrong
when
the
ladies
aiders
got
to
fight
i
mean
when
they
did
agree
about
something
corrected
pollyanna
hastily
why
it
was
those
texts
too
father
said
that
made
him
think
of
the
game
he
began
with
me
on
the
crutches
but
he
said
was
the
rejoicing
texts
that
started
him
on
and
what
game
might
that
be
asked
the
minister
about
finding
something
in
everything
to
be
glad
about
you
know
as
i
said
he
began
with
me
on
the
and
once
more
pollyanna
told
her
story
this
time
to
a
man
who
listened
with
tender
eyes
and
understanding
ears
a
little
later
pollyanna
and
the
minister
descended
the
hill
hand
in
hand
pollyanna
face
was
radiant
pollyanna
loved
to
talk
and
she
had
been
talking
now
for
some
time
there
seemed
to
be
so
many
many
things
about
the
game
her
father
and
the
old
home
life
that
the
minister
wanted
to
know
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
their
ways
parted
and
pollyanna
down
one
road
and
the
minister
down
another
walked
on
alone
in
the
rev
paul
ford
study
that
evening
the
minister
sat
thinking
near
him
on
the
desk
lay
a
few
loose
sheets
of
paper
his
sermon
notes
under
the
suspended
pencil
in
his
fingers
lay
other
sheets
of
paper
blank
his
sermon
to
be
but
the
minister
was
not
thinking
either
of
what
he
had
written
or
of
what
he
intended
to
write
in
his
imagination
he
was
far
away
in
a
little
western
town
with
a
missionary
minister
who
was
poor
sick
worried
and
almost
alone
in
the
world
but
who
was
poring
over
the
bible
to
find
how
many
times
his
lord
and
master
had
told
him
to
rejoice
and
be
after
a
time
with
a
long
sigh
the
rev
paul
ford
roused
himself
came
back
from
the
far
western
town
and
adjusted
the
sheets
of
paper
under
his
hand
matthew
and
he
wrote
then
with
a
gesture
of
impatience
he
dropped
his
pencil
and
pulled
toward
him
a
magazine
left
on
the
desk
by
his
wife
a
few
minutes
before
listlessly
his
tired
eyes
turned
from
paragraph
to
paragraph
until
these
words
arrested
them
a
father
one
day
said
to
his
son
tom
who
he
knew
had
refused
to
fill
his
mother
woodbox
that
morning
i
sure
you
be
glad
to
go
and
bring
in
some
wood
for
your
mother
and
without
a
word
tom
went
why
just
because
his
father
showed
so
plainly
that
he
expected
him
to
do
the
right
thing
suppose
he
had
said
i
overheard
what
you
said
to
your
mother
this
morning
and
i
ashamed
of
you
go
at
once
and
fill
that
woodbox
i
warrant
that
woodbox
would
be
empty
yet
so
far
as
tom
was
concerned
on
and
on
read
the
minister
a
word
here
a
line
there
a
paragraph
somewhere
else
what
men
and
women
need
is
encouragement
their
natural
resisting
powers
should
be
strengthened
not
weakened
instead
of
always
harping
on
a
man
faults
tell
him
of
his
virtues
try
to
pull
him
out
of
his
rut
of
bad
habits
hold
up
to
him
his
better
self
his
real
self
that
can
dare
and
do
and
win
out
the
influence
of
a
beautiful
helpful
hopeful
character
is
contagious
and
may
revolutionize
a
whole
town
people
radiate
what
is
in
their
minds
and
in
their
hearts
if
a
man
feels
kindly
and
obliging
his
neighbors
will
feel
that
way
too
before
long
but
if
he
scolds
and
scowls
and
criticizes
his
neighbors
will
return
scowl
for
scowl
and
add
interest
when
you
look
for
the
bad
expecting
it
you
will
get
it
when
you
know
you
will
find
the
good
you
will
get
that
tell
your
son
tom
you
know
he
be
glad
to
fill
that
woodbox
then
watch
him
start
alert
and
interested
the
minister
dropped
the
paper
and
lifted
his
chin
in
a
moment
he
was
on
his
feet
tramping
the
narrow
room
back
and
forth
back
and
forth
later
some
time
later
he
drew
a
long
breath
and
dropped
himself
in
the
chair
at
his
desk
god
helping
me
i
do
it
he
cried
softly
i
tell
all
my
toms
i
know
they
be
glad
to
fill
that
woodbox
i
give
them
work
to
do
and
i
make
them
so
full
of
the
very
joy
of
doing
it
that
they
have
time
to
look
at
their
neighbors
woodboxes
and
he
picked
up
his
sermon
notes
tore
straight
through
the
sheets
and
cast
them
from
him
so
that
on
one
side
of
his
chair
lay
but
woe
unto
you
and
on
the
other
scribes
and
pharisees
hypocrites
while
across
the
smooth
white
paper
before
him
his
pencil
fairly
flew
after
first
drawing
one
black
line
through
matthew
and
thus
it
happened
that
the
rev
paul
ford
sermon
the
next
sunday
was
a
veritable
to
the
best
that
was
in
every
man
and
woman
and
child
that
heard
it
and
its
text
was
one
of
pollyanna
shining
eight
hundred
be
glad
in
the
lord
and
rejoice
ye
righteous
and
shout
for
joy
all
ye
that
are
upright
in
chapter
xxiii
an
accident
at
mrs
snow
request
pollyanna
went
one
day
to
chilton
office
to
get
the
name
of
a
medicine
which
mrs
snow
had
forgotten
as
it
chanced
pollyanna
had
never
before
seen
the
inside
of
office
i
never
been
to
your
home
before
this
is
your
home
is
it
she
said
looking
interestedly
about
her
the
doctor
smiled
a
little
sadly
yes
such
as
is
he
answered
as
he
wrote
something
on
the
pad
of
paper
in
his
hand
but
it
a
pretty
poor
apology
for
a
home
pollyanna
they
just
rooms
that
all
not
a
pollyanna
nodded
her
head
wisely
her
eyes
glowed
with
sympathetic
understanding
i
know
it
takes
a
woman
hand
and
heart
or
a
child
presence
to
make
a
home
she
said
eh
the
doctor
wheeled
about
abruptly
mr
pendleton
told
me
nodded
pollyanna
again
about
the
hand
and
heart
or
the
child
presence
you
know
why
do
you
get
a
woman
hand
and
heart
chilton
or
maybe
you
take
jimmy
bean
if
pendleton
does
want
chilton
laughed
a
little
constrainedly
so
pendleton
says
it
takes
a
woman
hand
and
heart
to
make
a
home
does
he
he
asked
evasively
yes
he
says
his
is
just
a
house
too
why
do
you
chilton
why
do
i
what
the
doctor
had
turned
back
to
his
desk
get
a
woman
hand
and
heart
oh
and
i
pollyanna
face
showed
suddenly
a
painful
color
i
suppose
i
ought
to
tell
you
it
was
aunt
polly
that
pendleton
loved
long
ago
and
so
we
we
are
going
there
to
live
you
see
i
told
you
it
was
but
i
made
a
mistake
i
hope
you
did
tell
any
one
she
finished
anxiously
no
i
did
tell
any
one
pollyanna
replied
the
doctor
a
little
queerly
oh
that
all
right
then
sighed
pollyanna
in
relief
you
see
you
the
only
one
i
told
and
i
thought
pendleton
looked
sort
of
funny
when
i
said
i
told
did
he
the
doctor
lips
twitched
yes
and
of
course
he
would
want
many
people
to
know
it
when
true
but
why
do
you
get
a
woman
hand
and
heart
chilton
there
was
a
moment
silence
then
very
gravely
the
doctor
said
they
not
always
to
be
had
for
the
asking
little
pollyanna
frowned
thoughtfully
but
i
should
think
you
could
get
she
argued
the
flattering
emphasis
was
unmistakable
thank
you
laughed
the
doctor
with
uplifted
eyebrows
then
gravely
again
i
afraid
some
of
your
older
sisters
would
not
be
quite
so
confident
at
least
they
they
have
shown
themselves
to
be
so
obliging
he
observed
pollyanna
frowned
again
then
her
eyes
widened
in
surprise
why
chilton
you
do
mean
you
did
try
to
get
somebody
hand
and
heart
once
like
pendleton
and
and
could
did
you
the
doctor
got
to
his
feet
a
little
abruptly
there
there
pollyanna
never
mind
about
that
now
do
let
other
people
troubles
worry
your
little
head
suppose
you
run
back
now
to
mrs
snow
i
written
down
the
name
of
the
medicine
and
the
directions
how
she
is
to
take
it
was
there
anything
else
pollyanna
shook
her
head
no
sir
thank
you
sir
she
murmured
soberly
as
she
turned
toward
the
door
from
the
little
hallway
she
called
back
her
face
suddenly
alight
anyhow
i
glad
was
my
mother
hand
and
heart
that
you
wanted
and
could
get
chilton
it
was
on
the
last
day
of
october
that
the
accident
occurred
pollyanna
hurrying
home
from
school
crossed
the
road
at
an
apparently
safe
distance
in
front
of
a
swiftly
approaching
motor
car
just
what
happened
no
one
could
seem
to
tell
afterward
neither
was
there
any
one
found
who
could
tell
why
it
happened
or
who
was
to
blame
that
it
did
happen
pollyanna
however
at
five
was
borne
limp
and
unconscious
into
the
little
room
that
was
so
dear
to
her
there
by
a
aunt
polly
and
a
weeping
nancy
she
was
undressed
tenderly
and
put
to
bed
while
from
the
village
hastily
summoned

hurrying
as
fast
as

motor
car
could
bring
him
and
ye

aunt

sobbing
to

she
wailed
wringing
her
hands
helplessly
even
after
the
doctor
was
gone
however
there
seemed
to
be
little
that
nancy
could
tell
tom
there
appeared
to
be
no
bones
broken
and
the
cut
was
of
slight
consequence
but
the
doctor
had
looked
very
grave
had
shaken
his
head
slowly
and
had
said
that
time
alone
could
tell
after
he
had
gone
miss
polly
had
shown
a
face
even
whiter
and
more
drawn
looking
than
before
the
patient
had
not
fully
recovered
consciousness
but
at
present
she
seemed
to
be
resting
as
comfortably
as
could
be
expected
a
trained
nurse
had
been
sent
for
and
would
come
that
night
that
was
all
and
nancy
turned
sobbingly
and
went
back
to
her
kitchen
it
was
sometime
during
the
next
forenoon
that
pollyanna
opened
conscious
eyes
and
realized
where
she
was
why
aunt
polly
what
the
matter
is
it
daytime
why
do
i
get
up
she
cried
why
aunt
polly
i
ca
get
up
she
moaned
falling
back
on
the
pillow
after
an
ineffectual
attempt
to
lift
herself
no
dear
i
would
try
just
yet
soothed
her
aunt
quickly
but
very
quietly
but
what
is
the
matter
why
ca
i
get
up
miss
polly
eyes
asked
an
agonized
question
of
the
young
woman
standing
in
the
window
out
of
the
range
of
pollyanna
eyes
the
young
woman
nodded
tell
her
the
lips
said
miss
polly
cleared
her
throat
and
tried
to
swallow
the
lump
that
would
scarcely
let
her
speak
you
were
hurt
dear
by
the
automobile
last
night
but
never
mind
that
now
auntie
wants
you
to
rest
and
go
to
sleep
hurt
oh
yes
i
i
pollyanna
eyes
were
dazed
she
lifted
her
hand
to
her
forehead
why
it
done
up
and
it
hurts
yes
dear
but
never
mind
just
just
but
aunt
polly
i
feel
so
funny
and
so
bad
my
legs
feel
so
so
queer
only
they
do
feel
at
all
with
an
imploring
look
into
the
nurse
face
miss
polly
struggled
to
her
feet
and
turned
away
the
nurse
came
forward
quickly
suppose
you
let
me
talk
to
you
now
she
began
cheerily
i
sure
i
think
it
high
time
we
were
getting
acquainted
and
i
going
to
introduce
myself
i
am
miss
hunt
and
i
come
to
help
your
aunt
take
care
of
you
and
the
very
first
thing
i
going
to
do
is
to
ask
you
to
swallow
these
little
white
pills
for
pollyanna
eyes
grew
a
bit
wild
but
i
do
want
to
be
taken
care
of
that
is
not
for
long
i
want
to
get
up
you
know
i
go
to
school
ca
i
go
to
school
from
the
window
where
aunt
polly
stood
now
there
came
a
cry
smiled
the
nurse
brightly
well
i
may
not
let
you
out
quite
so
soon
as
that
miss
pollyanna
but
just
swallow
these
little
pills
for
me
please
and
we
see
what
they
all
right
agreed
pollyanna
somewhat
doubtfully
but
i
must
go
to
school
day
after
there
are
examinations
then
you
she
spoke
again
a
minute
later
she
spoke
of
school
and
of
the
automobile
and
of
how
her
head
ached
but
very
soon
her
voice
trailed
into
silence
under
the
blessed
influence
of
the
little
white
pills
she
had
swallowed
chapter
xxiv
john
pendleton
pollyanna
did
not
go
to
school
nor
the
day
after
pollyanna
however
did
not
realize
this
except
momentarily
when
a
brief
period
of
full
consciousness
sent
insistent
questions
to
her
lips
pollyanna
did
not
realize
anything
in
fact
very
clearly
until
a
week
had
passed
then
the
fever
subsided
the
pain
lessened
somewhat
and
her
mind
awoke
to
full
consciousness
she
had
then
to
be
told
all
over
again
what
had
occurred
and
so
it
hurt
that
i
am
and
not
sick
she
sighed
at
last
well
i
glad
of
pollyanna
asked
her
aunt
who
was
sitting
by
the
bed
yes
i
so
much
rather
have
broken
legs
like
pendleton
than
like
mrs
snow
you
know
broken
legs
get
well
and
miss
polly
who
had
said
nothing
whatever
about
broken
legs
got
suddenly
to
her
feet
and
walked
to
the
little
dressing
table
across
the
room
she
was
picking
up
one
object
after
another
now
and
putting
each
down
in
an
aimless
fashion
quite
unlike
her
usual
decisiveness
her
face
was
not
at
all
however
it
was
white
and
drawn
on
the
bed
pollyanna
lay
blinking
at
the
dancing
band
of
colors
on
the
ceiling
which
came
from
one
of
the
prisms
in
the
window
i
glad
it
is
smallpox
that
ails
me
too
she
murmured
contentedly
that
would
be
worse
than
freckles
and
i
glad
whooping
cough
i
had
that
and
it
horrid
and
i
glad
appendicitis
nor
measles
they
catching
measles
are
i
mean
and
they
would
let
you
stay
you
seem
to
to
be
glad
for
a
good
many
things
my
dear
faltered
aunt
polly
putting
her
hand
to
her
throat
as
if
her
collar
bound
pollyanna
laughed
softly
i
am
i
been
thinking
of
lots
of
all

full
of

and

hurrying
from
the
room
through
the
door
by
which
the
nurse
had
just
entered
it

that

nearer

a
gesture
of
indifference
old
tom
turned
and
fell
to
work
if

you
got
ter
talk
plain
horse
sense
he
declared
testily

well
it
this
she
explained
i
heard
somethin
that
made
me
think
him
an
miss
polly
was
mr
pendleton
old
tom
straightened
up
yes
oh
i
know
now
he
was
it
was
that
blessed
child
mother
he
was
in
love
with
and
that
why
he
wanted
but
never
mind
that
part
she
added
hastily
remembering
just
in
time
her
promise
to
pollyanna
not
to
tell
that
pendleton
had
wished
her
to
come
and
live
with
him
well
i
been
askin
folks
about

some
since
and
i
found

that

an
that

hatin
him
like
pizen
owin
ter
the
silly
gossip
that

tergether
when

nodded
old
tom
it
was
three
or
four
years
after
miss
jennie

him
the
mitten
and
went
off
with
the
other
chap
miss
polly
knew
about
it
of
course
and
was
sorry
for
him
so
she
tried
ter
be
nice
to
him
maybe
she
overdid
it
a
little
she
hated
that
minister
chap
so
who
had
took
off
her
sister
at
any
rate
somebody

nancy
i

any
spunk
stand
that
then
about

time

trouble
with

after
that
she
shut
up
like
an
oyster
an
have
nothin

with
nobody
fur
a
spell
her
heart
jest
seemed
to
turn
bitter
at
the
yes
i
know
i
heard
about
that
now
rejoined
nancy
an
why
you
could
knocked
me
down
with
a
feather
when
i
see
him
at
the
door
him
what
she
hai
spoke
to
for
years
but
i
let
him
in
an
went
an
told
what

she

old
tom
held
his
breath
suspended
nothin
at
first
she

so
still
i
thought
she
had
heard
and
i
was
jest
goin
ter

over
when
she
speaks

quiet
like

will
be
down
at
once
an
i
come
an
told
him
then
i
come
out
here
an
told
you
finished
nancy
casting
another
backward
glance
toward
the
house
humph
grunted
old
tom
and
fell
to
work
again
in
the
ceremonious
parlor
of
the
harrington
homestead
john
pendleton
did
not
have
to
wait
long
before
a
swift
step
warned
him
of
miss
polly
coming
as
he
attempted
to
rise
she
made
a
gesture
of
remonstrance
she
did
not
offer
her
hand
however
and
her
face
was
coldly
reserved
i
called
to
ask
for
pollyanna
he
began
at
once
a
little
brusquely
thank
you
she
is
about
the
same
said
miss
polly
and
that
is
wo
you
tell
me
how
she
is
his
voice
was
not
quite
steady
this
time
a
quick
spasm
of
pain
crossed
the
woman
face
i
ca
i
wish
i
could
you
mean
you
do
know
but
the
doctor
dr
warren
himself
seems
at
sea
he
is
in
correspondence
now
with
a
new
york
specialist
they
have
arranged
for
a
consultation
at
but
but
what
were
her
injuries
that
you
do
know
a
slight
cut
on
the
head
one
or
two
bruises
and
and
an
injury
to
the
spine
which
has
seemed
to
cause
paralysis
from
the
hips
a
low
cry
came
from
the
man
there
was
a
brief
silence
then
huskily
he
asked
and
pollyanna
how
does
she
take
it
she
does
understand
at
all
how
things
really
are
and
i
ca
tell
but
she
must
know
something
miss
polly
lifted
her
hand
to
the
collar
at
her
throat
in
the
gesture
that
had
become
so
common
to
her
of
late
oh
yes
she
knows
she
ca
move
but
she
thinks
her
legs
are
broken
she
says
she
glad
it
broken
legs
like
yours
rather
than
like
mrs
snow
because
broken
legs
get
well
and
the
other
does
she
talks
like
that
all
the
time
until
it
it
seems
as
if
i
should
die
through
the
blur
of
tears
in
his
own
eyes
the
man
saw
the
drawn
face
opposite
twisted
with
emotion
involuntarily
his
thoughts
went
back
to
what
pollyanna
had
said
when
he
had
made
his
final
plea
for
her
presence
oh
i
could
leave
aunt
polly
now
it
was
this
thought
that
made
him
ask
very
gently
as
soon
as
he
could
control
his
voice
i
wonder
if
you
know
miss
harrington
how
hard
i
tried
to
get
pollyanna
to
come
and
live
with
with
you
pollyanna
the
man
winced
a
little
at
the
tone
of
her
voice
but
his
own
voice
was
still
impersonally
cool
when
he
spoke
again
yes
i
wanted
to
adopt
her
legally
you
understand
making
her
my
heir
of
the
woman
in
the
opposite
chair
relaxed
a
little
it
came
to
her
suddenly
what
a
brilliant
future
it
would
have
meant
for
pollyanna
this
adoption
and
she
wondered
if
pollyanna
were
old
enough
and
mercenary
enough
to
be
tempted
by
this
man
money
and
position
i
am
very
fond
of
pollyanna
the
man
was
continuing
i
am
fond
of
her
both
for
her
own
sake
and
for
her
mother
i
stood
ready
to
give
pollyanna
the
love
that
had
been
years
in
miss
polly
remembered
suddenly
why
she
had
taken
this
child
in
the
first
place
and
with
the
recollection
came
the
remembrance
of
pollyanna
own
words
uttered
that
very
morning
i
love
to
be
called
by
folks
that
belong
to
you
and
it
was
this
little
girl
that
had
been
offered
the
affection
of
years
and
she
was
old
enough
to
be
tempted
by
love
with
a
sinking
heart
miss
polly
realized
that
with
a
sinking
heart
too
she
realized
something
else
the
dreariness
of
her
own
future
now
without
pollyanna
well
she
said
and
the
man
recognizing
the
that
vibrated
through
the
harshness
of
the
tone
smiled
sadly
she
would
not
come
he
answered
why
she
would
not
leave
you
she
said
you
had
been
so
good
to
her
she
wanted
to
stay
with
you
and
she
said
she
thought
you
wanted
her
to
stay
he
finished
as
he
pulled
himself
to
his
feet
he
did
not
look
toward
miss
polly
he
turned
his
face
resolutely
toward
the
door
but
instantly
he
heard
a
swift
step
at
his
side
and
found
a
shaking
hand
thrust
toward
him
when
the
specialist
comes
and
i
know
anything
definite
about
pollyanna
i
will
let
you
hear
from
me
said
a
trembling
voice
and
thank
you
for
coming
pollyanna
will
be
chapter
xxv
a
waiting
game
on
the
day
after
john
pendleton
call
at
the
harrington
homestead
miss
polly
set
herself
to
the
task
of
preparing
pollyanna
for
the
visit
of
the
specialist
pollyanna
my
dear
she
began
gently
we
have
decided
that
we
want
another
doctor
besides
warren
to
see
you
another
one
might
tell
us
something
new
to
do
to
help
you
get
well
faster
you
a
joyous
light
came
to
pollyanna
face
dr
chilton
oh
aunt
polly
i
so
love
to
have
chilton
wanted
him
all
the
time
but
i
was
afraid
you
did
on
account
of
his
seeing
you
in
the
sun
parlor
that
day
you
know
so
i
did
like
to
say
anything
but
i
so
glad
you
do
want
him
aunt
polly
face
had
turned
white
then
red
then
back
to
white
again
but
when
she
answered
she
showed
very
plainly
that
she
was
trying
to
speak
lightly
and
cheerfully
oh
no
dear
it
was
chilton
at
all
that
i
meant
it
is
a
new
doctor
a
very
famous
doctor
from
new
york
who
who
knows
a
great
deal
about
about
hurts
like
pollyanna
face
fell
i
do
believe
he
knows
half
so
much
as
oh
yes
he
does
i
sure
but
it
was
chilton
who
doctored
pendleton
broken
leg
aunt
polly
if
if
you
do
mind
very
much
i
would
like
to
have
chilton
truly
i
would
a
distressed
color
suffused
miss
polly
face
for
a
moment
she
did
not
speak
at
all
then
she
said
gently
though
yet
with
a
touch
of
her
old
stern
decisiveness
but
i
do
mind
pollyanna
i
mind
very
much
i
would
do
anything
almost
anything
for
you
my
dear
but
i
for
reasons
which
i
do
not
care
to
speak
of
now
i
do
wish
chilton
called
in
on
on
this
case
and
believe
me
he
can
not
know
so
much
about
about
your
trouble
as
this
great
doctor
does
who
will
come
from
new
york
pollyanna
still
looked
unconvinced
but
aunt
polly
if
you
loved
chilton
what
pollyanna
aunt
polly
voice
was
very
sharp
now
her
cheeks
were
very
red
too
i
say
if
you
loved
chilton
and
did
love
the
other
one
sighed
pollyanna
seems
to
me
that
would
make
some
difference
in
the
good
he
would
do
and
i
love
the
nurse
entered
the
room
at
that
moment
and
aunt
polly
rose
to
her
feet
abruptly
a
look
of
relief
on
her
face
i
am
very
sorry
pollyanna
she
said
a
little
stiffly
but
afraid
you
have
to
let
me
be
the
judge
this
time
besides
already
arranged
the
new
york
doctor
is
coming
as
it
happened
however
the
new
york
doctor
did
not
come
at
the
last
moment
a
telegram
told
of
an
unavoidable
delay
owing
to
the
sudden
illness
of
the
specialist
himself
this
led
pollyanna
into
a
renewed
pleading
for
the
substitution
of
chilton
which
would
be
so
easy
now
you
but
as
before
aunt
polly
shook
her
head
and
said
no
dear
very
decisively
yet
with
a
still
more
anxious
assurance
that
she
would
do
anything
anything
but
that
to
please
her
dear
pollyanna
as
the
days
of
waiting
passed
one
by
one
it
did
indeed
seem
that
aunt
polly
was
doing
everything
but
that
that
she
could
do
to
please
her
niece
i
would
believed
it
you
could
made
me
believe
it
nancy
said
to
old
tom
one
morning
there
do
seem
ter
be
a
minute
in
the
day
that
miss
polly
ai
jest
hangin
waitin
ter
do
for
that
blessed
lamb
if
more
than
ter
let
in
the
cat
an
her
what
would
let
fluff
nor
buff
for
love
nor
money
a
week
ago
an
now
she
lets
tumble
all
over
the
bed
jest
it
pleases
miss
pollyanna
an
when
she
ai
doin
nothin
else
she
movin
them
little
glass
danglers
ter
winders
in
the
room
so
the
sun
make
the
dance
as
that
blessed
child
calls
it
she
sent
timothy
down
ter
cobb
greenhouse
three
times
for
fresh
flowers
an
that
besides
all
the
posies
fetched
in
ter
her
too
an
the
other
day
if
i
did
find
her
sittin
the
bed
with
the
nurse
actually
doin
her
hair
an
miss
pollyanna
lookin
on
an
bossin
from
the
bed
her
eyes
all
shinin
an
happy
an
i
declare
ter
goodness
if
miss
polly
wore
her
hair
like
that
every
day
now
jest
ter
please
that
blessed
child
old
tom
chuckled
well
it
strikes
me
miss
polly
herself
ai
lookin
none
the
worse
for
wearin
them
curls
her
forehead
he
observed
dryly
she
ai
retorted
nancy
indignantly
she
looks
like
folks
now
she
actually
almost
keerful
now
nancy
interrupted
the
old
man
with
a
slow
grin
you
know
what
you
said
when
i
told
ye
she
was
handsome
nancy
shrugged
her
shoulders
oh
she
ai
handsome
of
course
but
i
will
own
up
she
do
look
like
the
same
woman
what
with
the
ribbons
an
lace
jiggers
miss
pollyanna
makes
her
wear
her
i
told
ye
so
nodded
the
man
i
told
ye
she
nancy
laughed
well
i
own
up
she
hai
got
quite
so
good
an
imitation
of
it
as
she
did
have
miss
pollyanna
come
say
tom
who
was
her
a
lover
i
hai
found
that
out
yet
i
hai
i
hai
hai
ye
asked
the
old
man
with
an
odd
look
on
his
face
well
i
guess
ye
wo
then
from
oh
tom
come
on
now
wheedled
the
girl
ye
see
there
many
folks
here
that
i
can
maybe
not
but
there
one
anyhow
that
ai
answerin
grinned
old
tom
then
abruptly
the
light
died
from
his
eyes
how
is
she
the
little
gal
nancy
shook
her
head
her
face
too
had
sobered
just
the
same
tom
there
ai
no
special
as
i
can
see
or
anybody
i
guess
she
jest
lays
there
an
sleeps
an
talks
some
an
tries
ter
smile
an
be
the
sun
sets
or
the
moon
rises
or
some
other
such
thing
till
it
enough
ter
make
yer
heart
break
with
i
know
it
the
bless
her
sweet
heart
nodded
old
tom
blinking
a
little
she
told
you
then
too
about
that
game
oh
yes
she
told
me
long
the
old
man
hesitated
then
went
on
his
lips
twitching
a
little
i
was
growlin
one
day
i
was
so
bent
up
and
crooked
an
what
do
ye
the
little
thing
said
i
could
guess
i
would
think
she
could
find
anythin
about
that
ter
be
glad
about
she
did
she
said
i
could
be
glad
anyhow
that
i
did
have
ter
stoop
so
far
ter
do
my
weedin
i
was
already

said
tom
well
she

miss
polly
rejoined
nancy
miss
pollyanna
told
me
long
ago
that
she
could
tell
her
her
aunt

like
ter
have
her
talk
about
her
father
an
was
her
father
game
an
have
ter
talk
about
him
if
she
did
tell
it
so
she
never
told
oh
i
see
i
the
old
man
nodded
his
head
slowly
they
was
always
bitter
against
the
minister
chap
all
of
he
took
miss
jennie
away
from
an
miss
polly
young
as
she
was
could
never
forgive
him
she
was
that
fond
of
miss
jennie
in
them
days
i
see
i
see
was
a
bad
mess
he
sighed
as
he
turned
away
yes
was
all
all
sighed
nancy
in
her
turn
as
she
went
back
to
her
kitchen
for
no
one
were
those
days
of
waiting
easy
the
nurse
tried
to
look
cheerful
but
her
eyes
were
troubled
the
doctor
was
openly
nervous
and
impatient
miss
polly
said
little
but
even
the
softening
waves
of
hair
about
her
face
and
the
becoming
laces
at
her
throat
could
not
hide
the
fact
that
she
was
growing
thin
and
pale
as
to
pollyanna
pollyanna
petted
the
dog
smoothed
the
cat
sleek
head
admired
the
flowers
and
ate
the
fruits
and
jellies
that
were
sent
in
to
her
and
returned
innumerable
cheery
answers
to
the
many
messages
of
love
and
inquiry
that
were
brought
to
her
bedside
but
she
too
grew
pale
and
thin
and
the
nervous
activity
of
the
poor
little
hands
and
arms
only
emphasized
the
pitiful
motionlessness
of
the
once
active
little
feet
and
legs
now
lying
so
woefully
quiet
under
the
blankets
as
to
the
game
pollyanna
told
nancy
these
days
how
glad
she
was
going
to
be
when
she
could
go
to
school
again
go
to
see
mrs
snow
go
to
call
on
pendleton
and
go
to
ride
with
chilton
nor
did
she
seem
to
realize
that
all
this
gladness
was
in
the
future
not
the
present
nancy
however
did
realize
it
and
cry
about
it
when
she
was
alone
chapter
xxvi
a
door
ajar
just
a
week
from
the
time
mead
the
specialist
was
first
expected
he
came
he
was
a
tall
man
with
kind
gray
eyes
and
a
cheerful
smile
pollyanna
liked
him
at
once
and
told
him
so
you
look
quite
a
lot
like
my
doctor
you
see
she
added
engagingly
your
doctor
mead
glanced
in
evident
surprise
at
warren
talking
with
the
nurse
a
few
feet
away
warren
was
a
small
man
with
a
pointed
brown
beard
oh
that
is
my
doctor
smiled
pollyanna
divining
his
thought
dr
warren
is
aunt
polly
doctor
my
doctor
is
said
mead
a
little
oddly
his
eyes
resting
on
miss
polly
who
with
a
vivid
blush
had
turned
hastily
away
pollyanna
hesitated
then
continued
with
her
usual
truthfulness
you
see
wanted
chilton
all
the
time
but
aunt
polly
wanted
you
she
said
you
knew
more
than
chilton
anyway
about
about
broken
legs
like
mine
and
of
course
if
you
do
i
can
be
glad
for
that
do
you
a
swift
something
crossed
the
doctor
face
that
pollyanna
could
not
quite
translate
only
time
can
tell
that
little
girl
he
said
gently
then
he
turned
a
grave
face
toward
warren
who
had
just
come
to
the
bedside
every
one
said
afterward
that
it
was
the
cat
that
did
it
certainly
if
fluffy
had
not
poked
an
insistent
paw
and
nose
against
unlatched
door
the
door
would
not
have
swung
noiselessly
open
on
its
hinges
until
it
stood
perhaps
a
foot
ajar
and
if
the
door
had
not
been
open
pollyanna
would
not
have
heard
her
aunt
words
in
the
hall
the
two
doctors
the
nurse
and
miss
polly
stood
talking
in
pollyanna
room
fluffy
had
just
jumped
to
the
bed
with
a
little
purring
meow
of
joy
when
through
the
open
door
sounded
clearly
and
sharply
aunt
polly
agonized
exclamation
not
that
doctor
not
that
you
do
mean
the
child
will
never
walk
again
it
was
all
confusion
then
first
from
the
bedroom
came
terrified
aunt
polly
aunt
polly
then
miss
polly
seeing
the
open
door
and
realizing
that
her
words
had
been
heard
gave
a
low
little
moan
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
fainted
dead
away
the
nurse
with
a
choking
she
heard
stumbled
toward
the
open
door
the
two
doctors
stayed
with
miss
polly
mead
had
to
stay
he
had
caught
miss
polly
as
she
fell
warren
stood
by
helplessly
it
was
not
until
pollyanna
cried
out
again
sharply
and
the
nurse
closed
the
door
that
the
two
men
with
a
despairing
glance
into
each
other
eyes
awoke
to
the
immediate
duty
of
bringing
the
woman
in
mead
arms
back
to
unhappy
consciousness
in
pollyanna
room
the
nurse
had
found
a
purring
gray
cat
on
the
bed
vainly
trying
to
attract
the
attention
of
a
little
girl
miss
hunt
please
i
want
aunt
polly
i
want
her
right
away
quick
please
the
nurse
closed
the
door
and
came
forward
hurriedly
her
face
was
very
pale
she
she
ca
come
just
this
minute
dear
she
will
a
little
later
what
is
it
ca
i
get
it
pollyanna
shook
her
head
but
i
want
to
know
what
she
said
just
now
did
you
hear
her
i
want
aunt
polly
she
said
something
i
want
her
to
tell
me
true
is
true
the
nurse
tried
to
speak
but
no
words
came
something
in
her
face
sent
an
added
terror
to
pollyanna
eyes
miss
hunt
you
did
hear
her
it
is
true
oh
it
is
true
you
mean
i
ca
ever
walk
again
there
there
dear
do
do
choked
the
nurse
perhaps
he
know
perhaps
he
was
mistaken
there
lots
of
things
that
could
happen
you
but
aunt
polly
said
he
did
know
she
said
he
knew
more
than
anybody
else
about
about
broken
legs
like
mine
yes
yes
i
know
dear
but
all
doctors
make
mistakes
sometimes
just
just
do
think
any
more
about
it
now
please
do
pollyanna
flung
out
her
arms
wildly
but
i
ca
help
thinking
about
it
she
sobbed
it
all
there
is
now
to
think
about
why
miss
hunt
how
am
i
going
to
school
or
to
see
pendleton
or
mrs
snow
or
or
anybody
she
caught
her
breath
and
sobbed
wildly
for
a
moment
suddenly
she
stopped
and
looked
up
a
new
terror
in
her
eyes
why
miss
hunt
if
i
ca
walk
how
am
i
ever
going
to
be
glad
for
anything
miss
hunt
did
not
know
the
game
but
she
did
know
that
her
patient
must
be
quieted
and
that
at
once
in
spite
of
her
own
perturbation
and
heartache
her
hands
had
not
been
idle
and
she
stood
now
at
the
bedside
with
the
quieting
powder
ready
there
there
dear
just
take
this
she
soothed
and
by
and
by
be
more
rested
and
we
see
what
can
be
done
then
things
are
half
as
bad
as
they
seem
dear
lots
of
times
you
obediently
pollyanna
took
the
medicine
and
sipped
the
water
from
the
glass
in
miss
hunt
hand
i
know
that
sounds
like
things
father
used
to
say
faltered
pollyanna
blinking
off
the
tears
he
said
there
was
always
something
about
everything
that
might
be
worse
but
i
reckon
he
never
just
heard
he
could
ever
walk
again
i
do
see
how
there
can
be
anything
about
that
that
could
be
worse
do
you
miss
hunt
did
not
reply
she
could
not
trust
herself
to
speak
just
then
chapter
xxvii
two
visits
it
was
nancy
who
was
sent
to
tell
john
pendleton
of
verdict
miss
polly
had
remembered
her
promise
to
let
him
have
direct
information
from
the
house
to
go
herself
or
to
write
a
letter
she
felt
to
be
almost
equally
out
of
the
question
it
occurred
to
her
then
to
send
nancy
there
had
been
a
time
when
nancy
would
have
rejoiced
greatly
at
this
extraordinary
opportunity
to
see
something
of
the
house
of
mystery
and
its
master
but
her
heart
was
too
heavy
to
rejoice
at
anything
she
scarcely
even
looked
about
her
at
all
indeed
during
the
few
minutes
she
waited
for
john
pendleton
to
appear
i
nancy
sir
she
said
respectfully
in
response
to
the
surprised
questioning
of
his
eyes
when
he
came
into
the
room
miss
harrington
sent
me
to
tell
you
about
miss
well
in
spite
of
the
curt
terseness
of
the
word
nancy
quite
understood
the
anxiety
that
lay
behind
that
short
well
it
ai
well
pendleton
she
choked
you
do
mean
he
paused
and
she
bowed
her
head
miserably
yes
sir
he
says
she
ca
walk
again
for
a
moment
there
was
absolute
silence
in
the
room
then
the
man
spoke
in
a
voice
shaken
with
emotion
poor
little
girl
poor
little
girl
nancy
glanced
at
him
but
dropped
her
eyes
at
once
she
had
not
supposed
that
sour
cross
stern
john
pendleton
could
look
like
that
in
a
moment
he
spoke
again
still
in
the
low
unsteady
voice
it
seems
cruel
never
to
dance
in
the
sunshine
again
my
little
prism
girl
there
was
another
silence
then
abruptly
the
man
asked
she
herself
does
know
yet
of
course
does
she
but
she
does
sobbed
nancy
an
that
what
makes
it
all
the
harder
she
found
out
drat
that
cat
i
begs
yer
pardon
apologized
the
girl
hurriedly
it
only
that
the
cat
pushed
open
the
door
an
miss
pollyanna
overheard
talkin
she
found
out
that
poor
little
girl
sighed
the
man
again
yes
sir
you
say
so
sir
if
you
could
see
her
choked
nancy
i
hai
seen
her
but
twice
since
she
knew
about
it
an
it
done
me
up
both
times
ye
see
it
all
so
fresh
an
new
to
her
an
she
keeps
thinkin
all
the
time
of
new
things
she
ca
do
now
it
worries
her
too
she
ca
seem
ter
be
glad
maybe
you
do
know
about
her
game
though
broke
off
nancy
apologetically
the
game
asked
the
man
oh
yes
she
told
me
of
oh
she
did
well
i
guess
she
has
told
it
generally
ter
most
folks
but
ye
see
now
she
she
ca
play
it
herself
an
it
worries
her
she
says
she
ca
think
of
a
thing
not
a
thing
about
this
not
again
ter
be
glad
well
why
should
she
retorted
the
man
almost
savagely
nancy
shifted
her
feet
uneasily
that
the
way
i
felt
too
till
i
happened
ter
think
it
would
be
easier
if
she
could
find
somethin
ye
know
so
i
tried
to
to
remind
to
remind
her
of
what
john
pendleton
voice
was
still
angrily
impatient
of
of
how
she
told
others
ter
play
it
mis
snow
and
the
rest
ye
know
and
what
she
said
for
them
ter
do
but
the
poor
little
lamb
just
cries
an
says
it
do
seem
the
same
somehow
she
says
it
easy
ter
tell
lifelong
invalids
how
ter
be
glad
but
the
same
thing
when
you
the
lifelong
invalid
yerself
an
have
ter
try
ter
do
it
she
says
she
told
herself
over
an
over
again
how
glad
she
is
that
other
folks
ai
like
her
but
that
all
the
time
she
sayin
it
she
really
thinkin
of
anythin
only
how
she
ca
ever
walk
nancy
paused
but
the
man
did
not
speak
he
sat
with
his
hand
over
his
eyes
then
i
tried
ter
remind
her
how
she
used
ter
say
the
game
was
all
the
nicer
ter
play
when
when
it
was
hard
resumed
nancy
in
a
dull
voice
but
she
says
that
too
is
when
it
really
is
hard
an
i
must
be
goin
now
sir
she
broke
off
abruptly
at
the
door
she
hesitated
turned
and
asked
timidly
i
could
be
tellin
miss
pollyanna
that
that
you
seen
jimmy
bean
again
i
sir
could
i
i
do
see
how
you
could
as
i
have
seen
him
observed
the
man
a
little
shortly
why
nothin
sir
only
well
ye
see
that
one
of
the
things
that
she
was
feelin
bad
about
that
she
could
take
him
ter
see
you
now
she
said
she
taken
him
once
but
she
did
think
he
showed
off
very
well
that
day
and
that
she
was
afraid
you
did
think
he
would
make
a
very
nice
child
presence
after
all
maybe
you
know
what
she
means
by
that
but
i
did
yes
i
know
what
she
all
right
sir
it
was
only
that
she
was
wantin
ter
take
him
again
she
said
so
ter
show
ye
he
really
was
a
lovely
child
presence
and
now
she
ca
drat
that
autymobile
i
begs
yer
pardon
sir
and
nancy
fled
precipitately
it
did
not
take
long
for
the
entire
town
of
beldingsville
to
learn
that
the
great
new
york
doctor
had
said
pollyanna
whittier
would
never
walk
again
and
certainly
never
before
had
the
town
been
so
stirred
everybody
knew
by
sight
now
the
piquant
little
freckled
face
that
had
always
a
smile
of
greeting
and
almost
everybody
knew
of
the
game
that
pollyanna
was
playing
to
think
that
now
never
again
would
that
smiling
face
be
seen
on
their
streets
never
again
would
that
cheery
little
voice
proclaim
the
gladness
of
some
everyday
experience
it
seemed
unbelievable
impossible
cruel
in
kitchens
and
sitting
rooms
and
over
fences
women
talked
of
it
and
wept
openly
on
street
corners
and
in
store
the
men
talked
too
and
wept
though
not
so
openly
and
neither
the
talking
nor
the
weeping
grew
less
when
fast
on
the
heels
of
the
news
itself
came
nancy
pitiful
story
that
pollyanna
face
to
face
with
what
had
come
to
her
was
bemoaning
most
of
all
the
fact
that
she
could
not
play
the
game
that
she
could
not
now
be
glad
over
anything
it
was
then
that
the
same
thought
must
have
in
some
way
come
to
pollyanna
friends
at
all
events
almost
at
once
the
mistress
of
the
harrington
homestead
greatly
to
her
surprise
began
to
receive
calls
calls
from
people
she
knew
and
people
she
did
not
know
calls
from
men
women
and
children
many
of
whom
miss
polly
had
not
supposed
that
her
niece
knew
at
all
some
came
in
and
sat
down
for
a
stiff
five
or
ten
minutes
some
stood
awkwardly
on
the
porch
steps
fumbling
with
hats
or
according
to
their
sex
some
brought
a
book
a
bunch
of
flowers
or
a
dainty
to
tempt
the
palate
some
cried
frankly
some
turned
their
backs
and
blew
their
noses
furiously
but
all
inquired
very
anxiously
for
the
little
injured
girl
and
all
sent
to
her
some
message
and
it
was
these
messages
which
after
a
time
stirred
miss
polly
to
action
first
came
john
pendleton
he
came
without
his
crutches
i
do
need
to
tell
you
how
shocked
i
am
he
began
almost
harshly
but
can
nothing
be
done
miss
polly
gave
a
gesture
of
despair
oh
we
of
course
all
the
time
mead
prescribed
certain
treatments
and
medicines
that
might
help
and
warren
is
carrying
them
out
to
the
letter
of
course
but
mead
held
out
almost
no
john
pendleton
rose
abruptly
though
he
had
but
just
come
his
face
was
white
and
his
mouth
was
set
into
stern
lines
miss
polly
looking
at
him
knew
very
well
why
he
felt
that
he
could
not
stay
longer
in
her
presence
at
the
door
he
turned
i
have
a
message
for
pollyanna
he
said

for
a
brief
moment
miss
polly
lost
her
usual

will
adopt
jimmy
bean
she
gasped
the
man
lifted
his
chin
a
little
yes
i
think
pollyanna
will
understand
you
will
tell
her
i
thought
she
would
be
glad
why
of
of
course
faltered
miss
polly
thank
you
bowed
john
pendleton
as
he
turned
to
go
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
miss
polly
stood
silent
and
amazed
still
looking
after
the
man
who
had
just
left
her
even
yet
she
could
scarcely
believe
what
her
ears
had
heard
john
pendleton
adopt
jimmy
bean
john
pendleton
wealthy
independent
morose
reputed
to
be
miserly
and
supremely
selfish
to
adopt
a
little
boy
and
such
a
little
boy
with
a
somewhat
dazed
face
miss
polly
went
to
room
pollyanna
i
have
a
message
for
you
from
john
pendleton
he
has
just
been
here
he
says
to
tell
you
he
has
taken
jimmy
bean
for
his
little
boy
he
said
he
thought
you
be
glad
to
know
pollyanna
wistful
little
face
flamed
into
sudden
joy
glad
glad
well
i
reckon
i
am
glad
oh
aunt
polly
i
so
wanted
to
find
a
place
for
jimmy
and
that
such
a
lovely
place
besides
so
glad
for
pendleton
too
you
see
now
he
have
the
the
what
pollyanna
colored
painfully
she
had
forgotten
that
she
had
never
told
her
aunt
of
pendleton
desire
to
adopt
her
and
certainly
she
would
not
wish
to
tell
her
now
that
she
had
ever
thought
for
a
minute
of
leaving
her
this
dear
aunt
polly
the
child
presence
stammered
pollyanna
hastily
mr
pendleton
told
me
once
you
see
that
only
a
woman
hand
and
heart
or
a
presence
could
make
a
a
home
and
now
he
got
it
the
oh
i
see
said
miss
polly
very
gently
and
she
did
see
more
than
pollyanna
realized
she
saw
something
of
the
pressure
that
was
probably
brought
to
bear
on
pollyanna
herself
at
the
time
john
pendleton
was
asking
her
to
be
the
child
presence
which
was
to
transform
his
great
pile
of
gray
stone
into
a
home
i
see
she
finished
her
eyes
stinging
with
sudden
tears
pollyanna
fearful
that
her
aunt
might
ask
further
embarrassing
questions
hastened
to
lead
the
conversation
away
from
the
pendleton
house
and
its
master
dr
chilton
says
so
too
that
it
takes
a
woman
hand
and
heart
or
a
child
presence
to
make
a
home
you
know
she
remarked
miss
polly
turned
with
a
start
dr
chilton
how
do
you
know
that
he
told
me
so
was
when
he
said
he
lived
in
just
rooms
you
know
not
a
miss
polly
did
not
answer
her
eyes
were
out
the
window
so
i
asked
him
why
he
did
get
a
woman
hand
and
heart
and
have
a
pollyanna
miss
polly
had
turned
sharply
her
cheeks
showed
a
sudden
color
well
i
did
he
looked
so
so
what
did
he
say
miss
polly
asked
the
question
as
if
in
spite
of
some
force
within
her
that
was
urging
her
not
to
ask
it
he
did
say
anything
for
a
minute
then
he
said
very
low
that
you
could
always
get
for
the
there
was
a
brief
silence
miss
polly
eyes
had
turned
again
to
the
window
her
cheeks
were
still
unnaturally
pink
pollyanna
sighed
he
wants
one
anyhow
i
know
and
i
wish
he
could
have
why
pollyanna
how
do
you
know
because
afterwards
on
another
day
he
said
something
else
he
said
that
low
too
but
i
heard
him
he
said
that
he
give
all
the
world
if
he
did
have
one
woman
hand
and
heart
why
aunt
polly
what
the
matter
aunt
polly
had
risen
hurriedly
and
gone
to
the
window
nothing
dear
i
was
changing
the
position
of
this
prism
said
aunt
polly
whose
whole
face
now
was
aflame
chapter
xxviii
the
game
and
its
players
it
was
not
long
after
john
pendleton
second
visit
that
milly
snow
called
one
afternoon
milly
snow
had
never
before
been
to
the
harrington
homestead
she
blushed
and
looked
very
embarrassed
when
miss
polly
entered
the
room
i
i
came
to
inquire
for
the
little
girl
she
stammered
you
are
very
kind
she
is
about
the
same
how
is
your
mother
rejoined
miss
polly
wearily
that
is
what
i
came
to
tell
you
that
is
to
ask
you
to
tell
miss
pollyanna
hurried
on
the
girl
breathlessly
and
incoherently
we
think
it
so
awful
so
perfectly
awful
that
the
little
thing
ever
walk
again
and
after
all
she
done
for
us
too
for
mother
you
know
teaching
her
to
play
the
game
and
all
that
and
when
we
heard
how
now
she
could
play
it
herself
poor
little
dear
i
sure
i
do
see
how
she
can
either
in
her
condition
but
when
we
remembered
all
the
things
she
said
to
us
we
thought
if
she
could
only
know
what
she
had
done
for
us
that
it
would
help
you
know
in
her
own
case
about
the
game
because
she
could
be
glad
that
is
a
little
glad
milly
stopped
helplessly
and
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
miss
polly
to
speak
miss
polly
had
sat
politely
listening
but
with
a
puzzled
questioning
in
her
eyes
only
about
half
of
what
had
been
said
had
she
understood
she
was
thinking
now
that
she
always
had
known
that
milly
snow
was
queer
but
she
had
not
supposed
she
was
crazy
in
no
other
way
however
could
she
account
for
this
incoherent
illogical
unmeaning
rush
of
words
when
the
pause
came
she
filled
it
with
a
quiet
i
do
think
i
quite
understand
milly
just
what
is
it
that
you
want
me
to
tell
my
niece
yes
that
it
i
want
you
to
tell
her
answered
the
girl
feverishly
make
her
see
what
she
done
for
us
of
course
she
seen
some
things
because
she
been
there
and
she
known
mother
is
different
but
i
want
her
to
know
how
different
she
is
and
me
too
i
different
been
trying
to
play
it
the
game
a
miss
polly
frowned
she
would
have
asked
what
milly
meant
by
this
game
but
there
was
no
opportunity
milly
was
rushing
on
again
with
nervous
volubility
you
know
nothing
was
ever
right
before
for
mother
she
was
always
wanting
different
and
really
i
do
know
as
one
could
blame
her
much
under
the
circumstances
but
now
she
lets
me
keep
the
shades
up
and
she
takes
interest
in
things
how
she
looks
and
her
nightdress
and
all
that
and
she
actually
begun
to
knit
little
things
reins
and
baby
blankets
for
fairs
and
hospitals
and
she
so
interested
and
so
glad
to
think
she
can
do
it
and
that
was
all
miss
pollyanna
doings
you
know
she
told
mother
she
could
be
glad
she
got
her
hands
and
arms
anyway
and
that
made
mother
wonder
right
away
why
she
did
do
something
with
her
hands
and
arms
and
so
she
began
to
do
something
to
knit
you
know
and
you
ca
think
what
a
different
room
it
is
now
what
with
the
red
and
blue
and
yellow
worsteds
and
the
prisms
in
the
window
that
she
gave
her
why
it
actually
makes
you
feel
better
just
to
go
in
there
now
and
before
i
used
to
dread
it
awfully
it
was
so
dark
and
gloomy
and
mother
was
so
so
unhappy
you
know
and
so
we
want
you
to
please
tell
miss
pollyanna
that
we
understand
it
all
because
of
her
and
please
say
we
so
glad
we
know
her
that
we
thought
maybe
if
she
knew
it
it
would
make
her
a
little
glad
that
she
knew
us
and
and
that
all
sighed
milly
rising
hurriedly
to
her
feet
you
tell
her
why
of
course
murmured
miss
polly
wondering
just
how
much
of
this
remarkable
discourse
she
could
remember
to
tell
these
visits
of
john
pendleton
and
milly
snow
were
only
the
first
of
many
and
always
there
were
the
messages
the
messages
which
were
in
some
ways
so
curious
that
they
caused
miss
polly
more
and
more
to
puzzle
over
them
one
day
there
was
the
little
widow
benton
miss
polly
knew
her
well
though
they
had
never
called
upon
each
other
by
reputation
she
knew
her
as
the
saddest
little
woman
in
town
one
who
was
always
in
black
however
benton
wore
a
knot
of
pale
blue
at
the
throat
though
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
she
spoke
of
her
grief
and
horror
at
the
accident
then
she
asked
diffidently
if
she
might
see
pollyanna
miss
polly
shook
her
head
i
am
sorry
but
she
sees
no
one
yet
a
little
later
benton
wiped
her
eyes
rose
and
turned
to
go
but
after
she
had
almost
reached
the
hall
door
she
came
back
hurriedly
miss
harrington
perhaps
you
give
her
a
message
she
stammered
certainly
benton
i
shall
be
very
glad
still
the
little
woman
hesitated
then
she
spoke
will
you
tell
her
please
that
that
i
put
on
this
she
said
just
touching
the
blue
bow
at
her
throat
then
at
miss
polly
look
of
surprise
she
added
the
little
girl
has
been
trying
for
so
long
to
make
me
wear
some
color
that
i
thought
she
be
glad
to
know
i
begun
she
said
that
freddy
would
be
so
glad
to
see
it
if
i
would
you
know
freddy
all
i
have
now
the
others
have
all
benton
shook
her
head
and
turned
away
if
you
just
tell
pollyanna
and
the
door
closed
after
her
a
little
later
that
same
day
there
was
the
other
widow
at
least
she
wore
widow
garments
miss
polly
did
not
know
her
at
all
she
wondered
vaguely
how
pollyanna
could
have
known
her
the
lady
gave
her
name
as
mrs
i
a
stranger
to
you
of
course
she
began
at
once
but
i
not
a
stranger
to
your
little
niece
pollyanna
i
been
at
the
hotel
all
summer
and
every
day
i
had
to
take
long
walks
for
my
health
it
was
on
these
walks
that
i
met
your
niece
she
such
a
dear
little
girl
i
wish
i
could
make
you
understand
what
she
been
to
me
i
was
very
sad
when
i
came
up
here
and
her
bright
face
and
cheery
ways
reminded
me
of
my
own
little
girl
that
i
lost
years
ago
i
was
so
shocked
to
hear
of
the
accident
and
then
when
i
learned
that
the
poor
child
would
never
walk
again
and
that
she
was
so
unhappy
because
she
could
be
glad
any
longer
the
dear
child
i
just
had
to
come
to
you
are
very
kind
murmured
miss
polly
but
it
is
you
who
are
to
be
kind
demurred
the
other
i
i
want
you
to
give
her
a
message
from
me
will
you
will
you
just
tell
her
then
that
tarbell
is
glad
now
yes
i
know
it
sounds
odd
and
you
do
understand
but
if
you
pardon
me
i
rather
not
sad
lines
came
to
the
lady
mouth
and
the
smile
left
her
eyes
your
niece
will
know
just
what
i
mean
and
i
felt
that
i
must
tell
her
thank
you
and
pardon
me
please
for
any
seeming
rudeness
in
my
call
she
begged
as
she
took
her
leave
thoroughly
mystified
now
miss
polly
hurried
to
room
pollyanna
do
you
know
a
tarbell
oh
yes
i
love
tarbell
she
sick
and
awfully
sad
and
at
the
hotel
and
takes
long
walks
we
go
together
i
mean
we
used
pollyanna
voice
broke
and
two
big
tears
rolled
down
her
cheeks
miss
polly
cleared
her
throat
hurriedly
we
she
just
been
here
dear
she
left
a
message
for
you
but
she
would
tell
me
what
it
meant
she
said
to
tell
you
that
tarbell
is
glad
pollyanna
clapped
her
hands
softly
did
she
say
that
really
oh
i
so
glad
but
pollyanna
what
did
she
mean
why
it
the
game
and
pollyanna
stopped
short
her
fingers
to
her
lips
what
game
much
aunt
polly
that
is
i
ca
tell
it
unless
i
tell
other
things
that
that
i
not
to
speak
it
was
on
miss
polly
tongue
to
question
her
niece
further
but
the
obvious
distress
on
the
little
girl
face
stayed
the
words
before
they
were
uttered
not
long
after
tarbell
visit
the
climax
came
it
came
in
the
shape
of
a
call
from
a
certain
young
woman
with
unnaturally
pink
cheeks
and
abnormally
yellow
hair
a
young
woman
who
wore
high
heels
and
cheap
jewelry
a
young
woman
whom
miss
polly
knew
very
well
by
reputation
but
whom
she
was
angrily
amazed
to
meet
beneath
the
roof
of
the
harrington
homestead
miss
polly
did
not
offer
her
hand
she
drew
back
indeed
as
she
entered
the
room
the
woman
rose
at
once
her
eyes
were
very
red
as
if
she
had
been
crying
half
defiantly
she
asked
if
she
might
for
a
moment
see
the
little
girl
pollyanna
miss
polly
said
no
she
began
to
say
it
very
sternly
but
something
in
the
woman
pleading
eyes
made
her
add
the
civil
explanation
that
no
one
was
allowed
yet
to
see
pollyanna
the
woman
hesitated
then
a
little
brusquely
she
spoke
her
chin
was
still
at
a
slightly
defiant
tilt
my
name
is
payson
tom
payson
i
presume
you
heard
of
me
most
of
the
good
people
in
the
town
have
and
maybe
some
of
the
things
you
heard
ai
true
but
never
mind
that
it
about
the
little
girl
i
came
i
heard
about
the
accident
and
and
it
broke
me
all
up
last
week
i
heard
how
she
could
ever
walk
again
and
and
i
wished
i
could
give
up
my
two
uselessly
well
legs
for
hers
do
more
good
trotting
around
on
one
hour
than
i
could
in
a
hundred
years
but
never
mind
that
legs
ai
always
given
to
the
one
who
can
make
the
best
use
of
i
she
paused
and
cleared
her
throat
but
when
she
resumed
her
voice
was
still
husky
maybe
you
do
know
it
but
i
seen
a
good
deal
of
that
little
girl
of
yours
we
live
on
the
pendleton
hill
road
and
she
used
to
go
by
often
only
she
did
always
go
by
she
came
in
and
played
with
the
kids
and
talked
to
me
and
my
man
when
he
was
home
she
seemed
to
like
it
and
to
like
us
she
did
know
i
suspect
that
her
kind
of
folks
do
generally
call
on
my
kind
maybe
if
they
did
call
more
miss
harrington
there
would
be
so
many
of
my
kind
she
added
with
sudden
bitterness
be
that
as
it
may
she
came
and
she
did
do
herself
no
harm
and
she
did
do
us
good
a
lot
o
good
how
much
she
wo
know
nor
ca
know
i
hope
if
she
did
she
know
other
things
that
i
do
want
her
to
know
but
it
just
this
it
been
hard
times
with
us
this
year
in
more
ways
than
one
we
been
blue
and
discouraged
my
man
and
me
and
ready
for
anything
we
was
reckoning
on
getting
a
divorce
about
now
and
letting
the
kids
well
we
did
know
what
we
would
do
with
the
kids
then
came
the
accident
and
what
we
heard
about
the
little
never
walking
again
and
we
got
to
thinking
how
she
used
to
come
and
sit
on
our
doorstep
and
train
with
the
kids
and
laugh
and
and
just
be
glad
she
was
always
being
glad
about
something
and
then
one
day
she
told
us
why
and
about
the
game
you
know
and
tried
to
coax
us
to
play
it
well
we
heard
now
that
she
fretting
her
poor
little
life
out
of
her
because
she
ca
play
it
no
more
that
there
nothing
to
be
glad
about
and
that
what
i
came
to
tell
her
that
maybe
she
can
be
a
little
glad
for
us
we
decided
to
stick
to
each
other
and
play
the
game
ourselves
i
knew
she
would
be
glad
because
she
used
to
feel
kind
of
bad
at
things
we
said
sometimes
just
how
the
game
is
going
to
help
us
i
ca
say
that
i
exactly
see
yet
but
maybe
anyhow
we
going
to
try
she
wanted
us
to
will
you
tell
her
yes
i
will
tell
her
promised
miss
polly
a
little
faintly
then
with
sudden
impulse
she
stepped
forward
and
held
out
her
hand
and
thank
you
for
coming
payson
she
said
simply
the
defiant
chin
fell
the
lips
above
it
trembled
visibly
with
an
incoherently
mumbled
something
payson
blindly
clutched
at
the
outstretched
hand
turned
and
fled
the
door
had
scarcely
closed
behind
her
before
miss
polly
was
confronting
nancy
in
the
kitchen
nancy
miss
polly
spoke
sharply
the
series
of
puzzling
disconcerting
visits
of
the
last
few
days
culminating
as
they
had
in
the
extraordinary
experience
of
the
afternoon
had
strained
her
nerves
to
the
snapping
point
not
since
miss
pollyanna
accident
had
nancy
heard
her
mistress
speak
so
sternly
nancy
will
you
tell
me
what
this
absurd
is
that
the
whole
town
seems
to
be
babbling
about
and
what
please
has
my
niece
to
do
with
it
why
does
everybody
from
milly
snow
to
tom
payson
send
word
to
her
that
they
it
as
near
as
i
can
judge
half
the
town
are
putting
on
blue
ribbons
or
stopping
family
quarrels
or
learning
to
like
something
they
never
liked
before
and
all
because
of
pollyanna
i
tried
to
ask
the
child
herself
about
it
but
i
ca
seem
to
make
much
headway
and
of
course
i
do
like
to
worry
her
now
but
from
something
i
heard
her
say
to
you
last
night
i
should
judge
you
were
one
of
them
too
now
will
you
tell
me
what
it
all
means
to
miss
polly
surprise
and
dismay
nancy
burst
into
tears

her
chin
she
faced
her
mistress
and
looked
her
squarely
in
the
eye
i
tell
ye

a
game
miss
pollyanna
father
learned
her
ter
play
she
got
a
pair
of
crutches
once
in
a
missionary
barrel
when
she
was
wantin
a
doll
an
she
cried
of
course
like
any
child
would

then
her
father
told
her
that
there
was
ever
but
what
there
was
somethin
about
it
that
you

be
glad
about
that
she
could
be
glad
about
them
glad
for

helpless
little
legs
on
the
bed
yes

what
i
said
an
miss
pollyanna
said
that
what
she
said
too
but
he

miss
polly
and
after
that
she
said
he
made
a
regular
game
of
it
findin
in
everythin
ter
be
glad
about
an
she
said
ye
could
do
it
too
and
that
ye
did
seem

much
ye

need
the
crutches
an
they
called
it

miss
polly
came
to
a
helpless
pause
an
you
be
surprised
ter
find
how
cute
it
works
too
maintained
nancy
with
almost
the
eagerness
of
pollyanna
herself
i
wish

could
tell

what
a
lot
she
done
for
mother

the

the
game
with

i

somebody
who

it
now
choked
miss
polly
as
she
turned
and
sped
through
the
kitchen
doorway
behind
her
nancy
stood
staring
amazedly
well
i
believe
anythin
anythin
now
she
muttered
to
herself
ye
ca
stump
me
with
anythin
i
would
believe
now
o
miss
polly
a
little
later
in
pollyanna
room
the
nurse
left
miss
polly
and
pollyanna
alone
together
and
you
had
still
another
caller
my
dear
announced
miss
polly
in
a
voice
she
vainly
tried
to
steady
do
you
remember
payson
mrs
payson
why
i
reckon
i
do
she
lives
on
the
way
to
pendleton
and
she
got
the
prettiest
little
girl
baby
three
years
old
and
a
boy
five
she
awfully
nice
and
so
her
husband
only
they
do
seem
to
know
how
nice
each
other
is
sometimes
they
fight
i
mean
they
do
quite
agree
they
poor
too
they
say
and
of
course
they
do
ever
have
barrels
he
is
a
missionary
minister
you
know
like
well
he
a
faint
color
stole
into
pollyanna
cheeks
which
was
duplicated
suddenly
in
those
of
her
aunt
but
she
wears
real
pretty
clothes
sometimes
in
spite
of
their
being
so
poor
resumed
pollyanna
in
some
haste
and
she
got
perfectly
beautiful
rings
with
diamonds
and
rubies
and
emeralds
in
them
but
she
says
she
got
one
ring
too
many
and
that
she
going
to
throw
it
away
and
get
a
divorce
instead
what
is
a
divorce
aunt
polly
i
afraid
it
is
very
nice
because
she
did
look
happy
when
she
talked
about
it
and
she
said
if
she
did
get
it
they
would
live
there
any
more
and
that
payson
would
go
off
and
maybe
the
children
too
but
i
should
think
they
rather
keep
the
ring
even
if
they
did
have
so
many
more
should
you
aunt
polly
what
is
a
divorce
but
they
are
going
off
dear
evaded
aunt
polly
hurriedly
they
going
to
stay
right
there
oh
i
so
glad
then
they
be
there
when
i
go
up
to
see
o
dear
broke
off
the
little
girl
miserably
aunt
polly
why
ca
i
remember
that
my
legs
do
go
any
more
and
that
i
wo
ever
ever
go
up
to
see
pendleton
again
there
there
do
choked
her
aunt
perhaps
you
drive
up
sometime
but
listen
i
have
told
you
yet
all
that
payson
said
she
wanted
me
to
tell
you
that
they
they
were
going
to
stay
together
and
to
play
the
game
just
as
you
wanted
them
pollyanna
smiled
through
eyes
did
they
did
they
really
oh
i
am
glad
of
that
yes
she
said
she
hoped
you
be
that
why
she
told
you
to
make
you
glad
pollyanna
looked
up
quickly
why
aunt
polly
you
you
spoke
just
as
if
you
knew
do
you
know
about
the
game
aunt
polly
yes
miss
polly
sternly
forced
her
voice
to
be
cheerfully
nancy
told
me
i
think
it
a
beautiful
game
i
going
to
play
it
now
with
oh
aunt
polly
you
i
so
glad
you
see
i
really
wanted
you
most
of
anybody
all
the
aunt
polly
caught
her
breath
a
little
sharply
it
was
even
harder
this
time
to
keep
her
voice
steady
but
she
did
it
yes
dear
and
there
are
all
those
others
too
why
pollyanna
i
think
all
the
town
is
playing
that
game
now
with
you
even
to
the
minister
i
have
had
a
chance
to
tell
you
yet
but
this
morning
i
met
ford
when
i
was
down
to
the
village
and
he
told
me
to
say
to
you
that
just
as
soon
as
you
could
see
him
he
was
coming
to
tell
you
that
he
stopped
being
glad
over
those
eight
hundred
rejoicing
texts
that
you
told
him
about
so
you
see
dear
it
just
you
that
have
done
it
the
whole
town
is
playing
the
game
and
the
whole
town
is
wonderfully
happier
and
all
because
of
one
little
girl
who
taught
the
people
a
new
game
and
how
to
play
pollyanna
clapped
her
hands
oh
i
so
glad
she
cried
then
suddenly
a
wonderful
light
illumined
her
face
why
aunt
polly
there
is
something
i
can
be
glad
about
after
all
i
can
be
glad
i
had
my
legs
anyway
else
i
could
have
done
that
chapter
xxix
through
an
open
window
one
by
one
the
short
winter
days
came
and
went
but
they
were
not
short
to
pollyanna
they
were
long
and
sometimes
full
of
pain
very
resolutely
these
days
however
pollyanna
was
turning
a
cheerful
face
toward
whatever
came
was
she
not
specially
bound
to
play
the
game
now
that
aunt
polly
was
playing
it
too
and
aunt
polly
found
so
many
things
to
be
glad
about
it
was
aunt
polly
too
who
discovered
the
story
one
day
about
the
two
poor
little
waifs
in
a
who
found
a
door
to
crawl
under
and
who
wondered
what
poor
folks
did
that
did
have
any
door
and
it
was
aunt
polly
who
brought
home
the
other
story
that
she
had
heard
about
the
poor
old
lady
who
had
only
two
teeth
but
who
was
so
glad
that
those
two
teeth
hit
pollyanna
now
like
mrs
snow
was
knitting
wonderful
things
out
of
bright
colored
worsteds
that
trailed
their
cheery
lengths
across
the
white
spread
and
made
pollyanna
again
like
mrs
snow
so
glad
she
had
her
hands
and
arms
anyway
pollyanna
saw
people
now
occasionally
and
always
there
were
the
loving
messages
from
those
she
could
not
see
and
always
they
brought
her
something
new
to
think
about
and
pollyanna
needed
new
things
to
think
about
once
she
had
seen
john
pendleton
and
twice
she
had
seen
jimmy
bean
john
pendleton
had
told
her
what
a
fine
boy
jimmy
was
getting
to
be
and
how
well
he
was
doing
jimmy
had
told
her
what
a
home
he
had
and
what
folks
pendleton
made
and
both
had
said
that
it
was
all
owing
to
her
which
makes
me
all
the
gladder
you
know
that
i
have
had
my
legs
pollyanna
confided
to
her
aunt
afterwards
the
winter
passed
and
spring
came
the
anxious
watchers
over
pollyanna
condition
could
see
little
change
wrought
by
the
prescribed
treatment
there
seemed
every
reason
to
believe
indeed
that
worst
fears
would
be
realized
that
pollyanna
would
never
walk
again
beldingsville
of
course
kept
itself
informed
concerning
pollyanna
and
of
beldingsville
one
man
in
particular
fumed
and
fretted
himself
into
a
fever
of
anxiety
over
the
daily
bulletins
which
he
managed
in
some
way
to
procure
from
the
bed
of
suffering
as
the
days
passed
however
and
the
news
came
to
be
no
better
but
rather
worse
something
besides
anxiety
began
to
show
in
the
man
face
despair
and
a
very
dogged
determination
each
fighting
for
the
mastery
in
the
end
the
dogged
determination
won
and
it
was
then
that
john
pendleton
somewhat
to
his
surprise
received
one
saturday
morning
a
call
from
thomas
chilton
pendleton
began
the
doctor
abruptly
i
come
to
you
because
you
better
than
any
one
else
in
town
know
something
of
my
relations
with
miss
polly
john
pendleton
was
conscious
that
he
must
have
started
visibly
he
did
know
something
of
the
affair
between
polly
harrington
and
thomas
chilton
but
the
matter
had
not
been
mentioned
between
them
for
fifteen
years
or
more
yes
he
said
trying
to
make
his
voice
sound
concerned
enough
for
sympathy
and
not
eager
enough
for
curiosity
in
a
moment
he
saw
that
he
need
not
have
worried
however
the
doctor
was
quite
too
intent
on
his
errand
to
notice
how
that
errand
was
received
pendleton
i
want
to
see
that
child
i
want
to
make
an
examination
i
must
make
an
well
ca
you
ca
i
pendleton
you
know
very
well
i
have
been
inside
that
door
for
more
than
fifteen
years
you
do
know
but
i
will
tell
you
that
the
mistress
of
that
house
told
me
that
the
next
time
she
asked
me
to
enter
it
i
might
take
it
that
she
was
begging
my
pardon
and
that
all
would
be
as
before
which
meant
that
she
marry
me
perhaps
you
see
her
summoning
me
now
but
i
do
but
could
you
go
without
a
summons
the
doctor
frowned
well
hardly
have
some
pride
you
but
if
you
so
anxious
could
you
swallow
your
pride
and
forget
the
quarrel
forget
the
quarrel
interrupted
the
doctor
savagely
i
not
talking
of
that
kind
of
pride
so
far
as
that
is
concerned
i
go
from
here
there
on
my
knees
or
on
my
head
if
that
would
do
any
good
professional
pride
i
talking
about
it
a
case
of
sickness
and
i
a
doctor
i
ca
butt
in
and
say
take
me
can
i
chilton
what
was
the
quarrel
demanded
pendleton
the
doctor
made
an
impatient
gesture
and
got
to
his
feet
what
was
it
what
any
lovers
quarrel
after
it
over
he
snarled
pacing
the
room
angrily
a
silly
wrangle
over
the
size
of
the
moon
or
the
depth
of
a
river
maybe
it
might
as
well
be
so
far
as
its
having
any
real
significance
compared
to
the
years
of
misery
that
follow
them
never
mind
the
quarrel
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
am
willing
to
say
there
was
no
quarrel
pendleton
i
must
see
that
child
it
may
mean
life
or
death
it
will
mean
i
honestly
believe
nine
chances
out
of
ten
that
pollyanna
whittier
will
walk
again
the
words
were
spoken
clearly
impressively
and
they
were
spoken
just
as
the
one
who
uttered
them
had
almost
reached
the
open
window
near
john
pendleton
chair
thus
it
happened
that
very
distinctly
they
reached
the
ears
of
a
small
boy
kneeling
beneath
the
window
on
the
ground
outside
jimmy
bean
at
his
saturday
morning
task
of
pulling
up
the
first
little
green
weeds
of
the
flowerbeds
sat
up
with
ears
and
eyes
wide
open
walk
pollyanna
john
pendleton
was
saying
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
from
what
i
can
hear
and
learn
a
mile
from
her
bedside
that
her
case
is
very
much
like
one
that
a
college
friend
of
mine
has
just
helped
for
years
he
been
making
this
sort
of
thing
a
special
study
i
kept
in
touch
with
him
and
studied
too
in
a
way
and
from
what
i
hear
but
i
want
to
see
the
girl
john
pendleton
came
erect
in
his
chair
you
must
see
her
man
could
you
say
through
warren
the
other
shook
his
head
i
afraid
not
warren
has
been
very
decent
though
he
told
me
himself
that
he
suggested
consultation
with
me
at
the
first
but
miss
harrington
said
no
so
decisively
that
he
did
dare
venture
it
again
even
though
he
knew
of
my
desire
to
see
the
child
lately
some
of
his
best
patients
have
come
over
to
me
so
of
course
that
ties
my
hands
still
more
effectually
but
pendleton
i
got
to
see
that
child
think
of
what
it
may
mean
to
her
if
i
do
yes
and
think
of
what
it
will
mean
if
you
do
retorted
pendleton
but
how
can
i
without
a
direct
request
from
her
aunt
which
never
get
she
must
be
made
to
ask
you
how
i
do
no
i
guess
you
do
nor
anybody
else
she
too
proud
and
too
angry
to
ask
me
after
what
she
said
years
ago
it
would
mean
if
she
did
ask
me
but
when
i
think
of
that
child
doomed
to
lifelong
misery
and
when
i
think
that
maybe
in
my
hands
lies
a
chance
of
escape
but
for
that
confounded
nonsense
we
call
pride
and
professional
etiquette
i
he
did
not
finish
his
sentence
but
with
his
hands
thrust
deep
into
his
pockets
he
turned
and
began
to
tramp
up
and
down
the
room
again
angrily
but
if
she
could
be
made
to
see
to
understand
urged
john
pendleton
yes
and
who
going
to
do
it
demanded
the
doctor
with
a
savage
turn
i
do
know
i
do
know
groaned
the
other
miserably
outside
the
window
jimmy
bean
stirred
suddenly
up
to
now
he
had
scarcely
breathed
so
intently
had
he
listened
to
every
word
well
by
jinks
i
know
he
whispered
exultingly
i
ter
do
it
and
forthwith
he
rose
to
his
feet
crept
stealthily
around
the
corner
of
the
house
and
ran
with
all
his
might
down
pendleton
hill

uneven
rapid
gasps
jimmy
watching
her
with
anxious
eyes

agitated
miss

little
breathlessly
dr

once
to

chapter
xxxi
a
new
uncle
the
next
time
warren
entered
the
chamber
where
pollyanna
lay
watching
the
dancing
shimmer
of
color
on
the
ceiling
a
tall
man
followed
close
behind
him
dr
chilton
oh
chilton
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
cried
pollyanna
and
at
the
joyous
rapture
of
the
voice
more
than
one
pair
of
eyes
in
the
room
brimmed
hot
with
sudden
tears
but
of
course
if
aunt
polly
does
want
it
is
all
right
my
dear
do
worry
soothed
miss
polly
agitatedly
hurrying
forward
i
have
told
chilton
that
that
i
want
him
to
look
you
over
with
warren
this
oh
then
you
asked
him
to
come
murmured
pollyanna
contentedly
yes
dear
i
asked
him
that
is
but
it
was
too
late
the
adoring
happiness
that
had
leaped
to
chilton
eyes
was
unmistakable
and
miss
polly
had
seen
it
with
very
pink
cheeks
she
turned
and
left
the
room
hurriedly
over
in
the
window
the
nurse
and
warren
were
talking
earnestly
chilton
held
out
both
his
hands
to
pollyanna
little
girl
i
thinking
that
one
of
the
very
gladdest
jobs
you
ever
did
has
been
done
he
said
in
a
voice
shaken
with
emotion
at
twilight
a
wonderfully
tremulous
wonderfully
different
aunt
polly
crept
to
pollyanna
bedside
the
nurse
was
at
supper
they
had
the
room
to
themselves
pollyanna
dear
i
going
to
tell
you

very
first
one
of

your
uncle

done

happy
and
so
glad
darling
pollyanna
began
to
clap
her
hands
but
even
as
she
brought
her
small
palms
together
the
first
time
she
stopped
and
held
them
suspended
aunt

a
sob
perhaps
some
day
dear
but
aunt
polly
did
not
finish
aunt
polly
did
not
dare
to
tell
yet
the
great
hope
that
chilton
had
put
into
her
heart
but
she
did
say
this
and
