i
crosby
article
on
shakespeare
attitude
toward
the
working
classes
suggested
to
me
the
idea
of
also
expressing
my
own
opinion
about
the
works
of
shakespeare
in
direct
opposition
as
it
is
to
that
established
in
all
the
whole
european
world
calling
to
mind
all
the
struggle
of
doubt
and
efforts
to
attune
myself
to
shakespeare
which
i
went
through
owing
to
my
complete
disagreement
with
this
universal
adulation
and
presuming
that
many
have
experienced
and
are
experiencing
the
same
i
think
that
it
may
not
be
unprofitable
to
express
definitely
and
frankly
this
view
of
mine
opposed
to
that
of
the
majority
and
the
more
so
as
the
conclusions
to
which
i
came
when
examining
the
causes
of
my
disagreement
with
the
universally
established
opinion
are
it
seems
to
me
not
without
interest
and
significance
my
disagreement
with
the
established
opinion
about
shakespeare
is
not
the
result
of
an
accidental
frame
of
mind
nor
of
a
attitude
toward
the
matter
but
is
the
outcome
of
many
years
repeated
and
insistent
endeavors
to
harmonize
my
own
views
of
shakespeare
with
those
established
amongst
all
civilized
men
of
the
christian
world
i
remember
the
astonishment
i
felt
when
i
first
read
shakespeare
i
expected
to
receive
a
powerful
esthetic
pleasure
but
having
read
one
after
the
other
works
regarded
as
his
best
king
lear
romeo
and
juliet
hamlet
and
macbeth
not
only
did
i
feel
no
delight
but
i
felt
an
irresistible
repulsion
and
tedium
and
doubted
as
to
whether
i
was
senseless
in
feeling
works
regarded
as
the
summit
of
perfection
by
the
whole
of
the
civilized
world
to
be
trivial
and
positively
bad
or
whether
the
significance
which
this
civilized
world
attributes
to
the
works
of
shakespeare
was
itself
senseless
my
consternation
was
increased
by
the
fact
that
i
always
keenly
felt
the
beauties
of
poetry
in
every
form
then
why
should
artistic
works
recognized
by
the
whole
world
as
those
of
a
genius
the
works
of
shakespeare
not
only
fail
to
please
me
but
be
disagreeable
to
me
for
a
long
time
i
could
not
believe
in
myself
and
during
fifty
years
in
order
to
test
myself
i
several
times
recommenced
reading
shakespeare
in
every
possible
form
in
russian
in
english
in
german
and
in
translation
as
i
was
advised
several
times
i
read
the
dramas
and
the
comedies
and
historical
plays
and
i
invariably
underwent
the
same
feelings
repulsion
weariness
and
bewilderment
at
the
present
time
before
writing
this
preface
being
desirous
once
more
to
test
myself
i
have
as
an
old
man
of
again
read
the
whole
of
shakespeare
including
the
historical
plays
the
henrys
troilus
and
cressida
the
tempest
cymbeline
and
i
have
felt
with
even
greater
force
the
same
feelings
this
time
however
not
of
bewilderment
but
of
firm
indubitable
conviction
that
the
unquestionable
glory
of
a
great
genius
which
shakespeare
enjoys
and
which
compels
writers
of
our
time
to
imitate
him
and
readers
and
spectators
to
discover
in
him
merits
thereby
distorting
their
esthetic
and
ethical
understanding
is
a
great
evil
as
is
every
untruth
altho
i
know
that
the
majority
of
people
so
firmly
believe
in
the
greatness
of
shakespeare
that
in
reading
this
judgment
of
mine
they
will
not
admit
even
the
possibility
of
its
justice
and
will
not
give
it
the
slightest
attention
nevertheless
i
will
endeavor
as
well
as
i
can
to
show
why
i
believe
that
shakespeare
can
not
be
recognized
either
as
a
great
genius
or
even
as
an
average
author
for
illustration
of
my
purpose
i
will
take
one
of
shakespeare
most
extolled
dramas
king
lear
in
the
enthusiastic
praise
of
which
the
majority
of
critics
agree
the
tragedy
of
lear
is
deservedly
celebrated
among
the
dramas
of
shakespeare
says
johnson
there
is
perhaps
no
play
which
keeps
the
attention
so
strongly
fixed
which
so
much
agitates
our
passions
and
interests
our
curiosity
we
wish
that
we
could
pass
this
play
over
and
say
nothing
about
it
says
hazlitt
all
that
we
can
say
must
fall
far
short
of
the
subject
or
even
of
what
we
ourselves
conceive
of
it
to
attempt
to
give
a
description
of
the
play
itself
or
of
its
effects
upon
the
mind
is
mere
impertinence
yet
we
must
say
something
it
is
then
the
best
of
shakespeare
plays
for
it
is
the
one
in
which
he
was
the
most
in
earnest
if
the
originality
of
invention
did
not
so
much
stamp
almost
every
play
of
shakespeare
says
hallam
that
to
name
one
as
the
most
original
seems
a
disparagement
to
others
we
might
say
that
this
great
prerogative
of
genius
was
exercised
above
all
in
it
diverges
more
from
the
model
of
regular
tragedy
than
or
and
even
more
than
but
the
fable
is
better
constructed
than
in
the
last
of
these
and
it
displays
full
as
much
of
the
almost
superhuman
inspiration
of
the
poet
as
the
other
two
lear
may
be
recognized
as
the
perfect
model
of
the
dramatic
art
of
the
whole
world
says
shelley
i
am
not
minded
to
say
much
of
shakespeare
arthur
says
swinburne
there
are
one
or
two
figures
in
the
world
of
his
work
of
which
there
are
no
words
that
would
be
fit
or
good
to
say
another
of
these
is
cordelia
the
place
they
have
in
our
lives
and
thoughts
is
not
one
for
talk
the
niche
set
apart
for
them
to
inhabit
in
our
secret
hearts
is
not
penetrable
by
the
lights
and
noises
of
common
day
there
are
chapels
in
the
cathedrals
of
man
highest
art
as
in
that
of
his
inmost
life
not
made
to
be
set
open
to
the
eyes
and
feet
of
the
world
love
and
death
and
memory
keep
charge
for
us
in
silence
of
some
beloved
names
it
is
the
crowning
glory
of
genius
the
final
miracle
and
transcendent
gift
of
poetry
that
it
can
add
to
the
number
of
these
and
engrave
on
the
very
heart
of
our
remembrance
fresh
names
and
memories
of
its
own
creation
lear
is
the
occasion
for
cordelia
says
victor
hugo
maternity
of
the
daughter
toward
the
father
profound
subject
maternity
venerable
among
all
other
maternities
so
admirably
rendered
by
the
legend
of
that
roman
girl
who
in
the
depths
of
a
prison
nurses
her
old
father
the
young
breast
near
the
white
beard
there
is
not
a
spectacle
more
holy
this
filial
breast
is
cordelia
once
this
figure
dreamed
of
and
found
shakespeare
created
his
drama
shakespeare
carrying
cordelia
in
his
thoughts
created
that
tragedy
like
a
god
who
having
an
aurora
to
put
forward
makes
a
world
expressly
for
it
in
lear
shakespeare
vision
sounded
the
abyss
of
horror
to
its
very
depths
and
his
spirit
showed
neither
fear
nor
giddiness
nor
faintness
at
the
sight
says
brandes
on
the
threshold
of
this
work
a
feeling
of
awe
comes
over
one
as
on
the
threshold
of
the
sistine
chapel
with
its
ceiling
of
frescoes
by
michael
angelo
only
that
the
suffering
here
is
far
more
intense
the
wail
wilder
and
the
harmonies
of
beauty
more
definitely
shattered
by
the
discords
of
despair
such
are
the
judgments
of
the
critics
about
this
drama
and
therefore
i
believe
i
am
not
wrong
in
selecting
it
as
a
type
of
shakespeare
best
as
impartially
as
possible
i
will
endeavor
to
describe
the
contents
of
the
drama
and
then
to
show
why
it
is
not
that
acme
of
perfection
it
is
represented
to
be
by
critics
but
is
something
quite
different
ii
the
drama
of
lear
begins
with
a
scene
giving
the
conversation
between
two
courtiers
kent
and
gloucester
kent
pointing
to
a
young
man
present
asks
gloucester
whether
that
is
not
his
son
gloucester
says
that
he
has
often
blushed
to
acknowledge
the
young
man
as
his
son
but
has
now
ceased
doing
so
kent
says
he
can
not
conceive
him
then
gloucester
in
the
presence
of
this
son
of
his
says
the
fellow
mother
could
and
grew
and
had
a
son
for
her
cradle
ere
she
had
a
husband
for
her
bed
i
have
another
a
legitimate
son
continues
gloucester
but
altho
this
one
came
into
the
world
before
he
was
sent
for
his
mother
was
fair
and
there
was
good
sport
at
his
making
and
therefore
i
acknowledge
this
one
also
such
is
the
introduction
not
to
mention
the
coarseness
of
these
words
of
gloucester
they
are
farther
out
of
place
in
the
mouth
of
a
person
intended
to
represent
a
noble
character
one
can
not
agree
with
the
opinion
of
some
critics
that
these
words
are
given
to
gloucester
in
order
to
show
the
contempt
for
his
illegitimacy
from
which
edmund
suffers
were
this
so
it
would
first
have
been
unnecessary
to
make
the
father
express
the
contempt
felt
by
men
in
general
and
secondly
edmund
in
his
monolog
about
the
injustice
of
those
who
despise
him
for
his
birth
would
have
mentioned
such
words
from
his
father
but
this
is
not
so
and
therefore
these
words
of
gloucester
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
piece
were
merely
intended
as
a
communication
to
the
public
in
a
humorous
form
of
the
fact
that
gloucester
has
a
legitimate
son
and
an
illegitimate
one
after
this
trumpets
are
blown
and
king
lear
enters
with
his
daughters
and
and
utters
a
speech
to
the
effect
that
owing
to
old
age
he
wishes
to
retire
from
the
cares
of
business
and
divide
his
kingdom
between
his
daughters
in
order
to
know
how
much
he
should
give
to
each
daughter
he
announces
that
to
the
one
who
says
she
loves
him
most
he
will
give
most
the
eldest
daughter
goneril
says
that
words
can
not
express
the
extent
of
her
love
that
she
loves
her
father
more
than
eyesight
space
and
liberty
loves
him
so
much
that
it
makes
her
breath
poor
king
lear
immediately
allots
his
daughter
on
the
map
her
portion
of
fields
woods
rivers
and
meadows
and
asks
the
same
question
of
the
second
daughter
the
second
daughter
regan
says
that
her
sister
has
correctly
expressed
her
own
feelings
only
not
strongly
enough
she
regan
loves
her
father
so
much
that
everything
is
abhorrent
to
her
except
his
love
the
king
rewards
this
daughter
also
and
then
asks
his
youngest
the
favorite
in
whom
according
to
his
expression
are
interess
the
vines
of
france
and
the
milk
of
burgundy
that
is
whose
hand
is
being
claimed
by
the
king
of
france
and
the
duke
of
burgundy
he
asks
cordelia
how
she
loves
him
cordelia
who
personifies
all
the
virtues
as
the
eldest
two
all
the
vices
says
quite
out
of
place
as
if
on
purpose
to
irritate
her
father
that
altho
she
loves
and
honors
him
and
is
grateful
to
him
yet
if
she
marries
all
her
love
will
not
belong
to
her
father
but
she
will
also
love
her
husband
hearing
these
words
the
king
loses
his
temper
and
curses
this
favorite
daughter
with
the
most
dreadful
and
strange
maledictions
saying
for
instance
that
he
will
henceforth
love
his
daughter
as
little
as
he
loves
the
man
who
devours
his
own
children
the
barbarous
scythian
or
he
that
makes
his
generation
messes
to
gorge
his
appetite
shall
to
my
bosom
be
as
well
neighbour
pitied
and
relieved
as
thou
my
sometime
daughter
the
courtier
kent
defends
cordelia
and
desiring
to
appease
the
king
rebukes
him
for
his
injustice
and
says
reasonable
things
about
the
evil
of
flattery
lear
unmoved
by
kent
banishes
him
under
pain
of
death
and
calling
to
him
cordelia
two
suitors
the
duke
of
burgundy
and
the
king
of
france
proposes
to
them
in
turn
to
take
cordelia
without
dowry
the
duke
of
burgundy
frankly
says
that
without
dowry
he
will
not
take
cordelia
but
the
king
of
france
takes
her
without
dowry
and
leads
her
away
after
this
the
elder
sisters
there
and
then
entering
into
conversation
prepare
to
injure
their
father
who
had
endowed
them
thus
ends
the
first
scene
not
to
mention
the
pompous
characterless
language
of
king
lear
the
same
in
which
all
shakespeare
kings
speak
the
reader
or
spectator
can
not
conceive
that
a
king
however
old
and
stupid
he
may
be
could
believe
the
words
of
the
vicious
daughters
with
whom
he
had
passed
his
whole
life
and
not
believe
his
favorite
daughter
but
curse
and
banish
her
and
therefore
the
spectator
or
reader
can
not
share
the
feelings
of
the
persons
participating
in
this
unnatural
scene
the
second
scene
opens
with
edmund
gloucester
illegitimate
son
soliloquizing
on
the
injustice
of
men
who
concede
rights
and
respect
to
the
legitimate
son
but
deprive
the
illegitimate
son
of
them
and
he
determines
to
ruin
edgar
and
to
usurp
his
place
for
this
purpose
he
forges
a
letter
to
himself
as
from
edgar
in
which
the
latter
expresses
a
desire
to
murder
his
father
awaiting
his
father
approach
edmund
as
if
against
his
will
shows
him
this
letter
and
the
father
immediately
believes
that
his
son
edgar
whom
he
tenderly
loves
desires
to
kill
him
the
father
goes
away
edgar
enters
and
edmund
persuades
him
that
his
father
for
some
reason
desires
to
kill
him
edgar
immediately
believes
this
and
flees
from
his
parent
the
relations
between
gloucester
and
his
two
sons
and
the
feelings
of
these
characters
are
as
unnatural
as
lear
relation
to
his
daughters
or
even
more
so
and
therefore
it
is
still
more
difficult
for
the
spectator
to
transport
himself
into
the
mental
condition
of
gloucester
and
his
sons
and
sympathize
with
them
than
it
is
to
do
so
into
that
of
lear
and
his
daughters
in
the
fourth
scene
the
banished
kent
so
disguised
that
lear
does
not
recognize
him
presents
himself
to
lear
who
is
already
staying
with
goneril
lear
asks
who
he
is
to
which
kent
answers
one
does
know
why
in
a
tone
quite
inappropriate
to
his
position
a
very
fellow
and
as
poor
as
the
king
if
thou
be
as
poor
for
a
subject
as
he
is
for
a
king
thou
art
poor
enough
how
old
art
thou
asks
the
king
not
so
young
sir
to
love
a
woman
nor
so
old
to
dote
on
her
to
this
the
king
says
if
i
like
thee
no
worse
after
dinner
i
will
not
part
from
thee
yet
these
speeches
follow
neither
from
lear
position
nor
his
relation
to
kent
but
are
put
into
the
mouths
of
lear
and
kent
evidently
because
the
author
regards
them
as
witty
and
amusing
goneril
steward
appears
and
behaves
rudely
to
lear
for
which
kent
knocks
him
down
the
king
still
not
recognizing
kent
gives
him
money
for
this
and
takes
him
into
his
service
after
this
appears
the
fool
and
thereupon
begins
a
prolonged
conversation
between
the
fool
and
the
king
utterly
unsuited
to
the
position
and
serving
no
purpose
thus
for
instance
the
fool
says
give
me
an
egg
and
i
give
thee
two
crowns
the
king
asks
what
crowns
shall
they
be
why
says
the
fool
after
i
have
cut
the
egg
i
the
middle
and
eat
up
the
meat
the
two
crowns
of
the
egg
when
thou
clovest
thy
crown
i
the
middle
and
gavest
away
both
parts
thou
borest
thine
ass
on
thy
back
the
dirt
thou
hadst
little
wit
in
thy
bald
crown
when
thou
gavest
thy
golden
one
away
if
i
speak
like
myself
in
this
let
him
be
whipp
that
first
finds
it
so
in
this
manner
lengthy
conversations
go
on
calling
forth
in
the
spectator
or
reader
that
wearisome
uneasiness
which
one
experiences
when
listening
to
jokes
which
are
not
witty
this
conversation
was
interrupted
by
the
approach
of
goneril
she
demands
of
her
father
that
he
should
diminish
his
retinue
that
he
should
be
satisfied
with
fifty
courtiers
instead
of
a
hundred
at
this
suggestion
lear
gets
into
a
strange
and
unnatural
rage
and
asks
doth
any
here
know
me
this
is
not
lear
does
lear
walk
thus
speak
thus
where
are
his
eyes
either
his
notion
weakens
his
discernings
are
lethargied
ha
is
not
so
who
is
it
that
can
tell
me
who
i
am
and
so
forth
while
this
goes
on
the
fool
does
not
cease
to
interpolate
his
humorless
jokes
goneril
husband
then
enters
and
wishes
to
appease
lear
but
lear
curses
goneril
invoking
for
her
either
sterility
or
the
birth
of
such
an
as
would
return
laughter
and
contempt
for
her
motherly
cares
and
would
thus
show
her
all
the
horror
and
pain
caused
by
a
child
ingratitude
these
words
which
express
a
genuine
feeling
might
have
been
touching
had
they
stood
alone
but
they
are
lost
among
long
and
speeches
which
lear
keeps
incessantly
uttering
quite
inappropriately
he
either
invokes
blasts
and
fogs
upon
the
head
of
his
daughter
or
desires
his
curse
to
pierce
every
sense
about
her
or
else
appealing
to
his
own
eyes
says
that
should
they
weep
he
will
pluck
them
out
and
cast
them
with
the
waters
that
they
lose
to
temper
clay
and
so
on
after
this
lear
sends
kent
whom
he
still
fails
to
recognize
to
his
other
daughter
and
notwithstanding
the
despair
he
has
just
manifested
he
talks
with
the
fool
and
elicits
his
jokes
the
jokes
continue
to
be
mirthless
and
besides
creating
an
unpleasant
feeling
similar
to
shame
the
usual
effect
of
unsuccessful
witticisms
they
are
also
so
drawn
out
as
to
be
positively
dull
thus
the
fool
asks
the
king
whether
he
can
tell
why
one
nose
stands
in
the
middle
of
one
face
lear
says
he
can
why
to
keep
one
eyes
of
either
side
nose
that
what
a
man
can
not
smell
out
he
may
spy
out
canst
tell
how
an
oyster
makes
his
shell
no
nor
i
either
but
i
can
tell
why
a
snail
has
a
house
why
why
to
put
his
head
in
not
to
give
it
away
to
his
daughters
and
leave
his
horns
without
a
case
be
my
horses
ready
thy
asses
are
gone
about
the
reason
why
the
seven
stars
are
no
more
than
seven
is
a
pretty
reason
because
they
are
not
eight
yes
indeed
thou
make
a
good
fool
and
so
on
after
this
lengthy
scene
a
gentleman
enters
and
announces
that
the
horses
are
ready
the
fool
says
she
that
a
maid
now
and
laughs
at
my
departure
shall
not
be
a
maid
long
unless
things
be
cut
shorter
the
second
part
of
the
first
scene
of
the
second
act
begins
by
the
villain
edmund
persuading
his
brother
when
their
father
enters
to
pretend
that
they
are
fighting
with
their
swords
edgar
consents
altho
it
is
utterly
incomprehensible
why
he
should
do
so
the
father
finds
them
fighting
edgar
flies
and
edmund
scratches
his
arm
to
draw
blood
and
persuades
his
father
that
edgar
was
working
charms
for
the
purpose
of
killing
his
father
and
had
desired
edmund
to
help
him
but
that
he
edmund
had
refused
and
that
then
edgar
flew
at
him
and
wounded
his
arm
gloucester
believes
everything
curses
edgar
and
transfers
all
the
rights
of
the
elder
and
legitimate
son
to
the
illegitimate
edmund
the
duke
hearing
of
this
also
rewards
edmund
in
the
second
scene
in
front
of
gloucester
palace
lear
new
servant
kent
still
unrecognized
by
lear
without
any
reason
begins
to
abuse
oswald
goneril
steward
calling
him
a
knave
a
rascal
an
eater
of
broken
meats
a
base
proud
shallow
beggarly
filthy
knave
the
son
and
heir
of
a
mongrel
bitch
and
so
on
then
drawing
his
sword
he
demands
that
oswald
should
fight
with
him
saying
that
he
will
make
a
sop
o
the
moonshine
of
him
words
which
no
commentators
can
explain
when
he
is
stopped
he
continues
to
give
vent
to
the
strangest
abuse
saying
that
a
tailor
made
oswald
as
a
or
a
painter
could
not
have
made
him
so
ill
tho
they
had
been
but
two
hours
o
the
trade
he
further
says
that
if
only
leave
be
given
him
he
will
tread
this
unbolted
villain
into
mortar
and
daub
the
wall
of
a
jakes
with
him
thus
kent
whom
nobody
recognizes
altho
both
the
king
and
the
duke
of
cornwall
as
well
as
gloucester
who
is
present
ought
to
know
him
well
continues
to
brawl
in
the
character
of
lear
new
servant
until
he
is
taken
and
put
in
the
stocks
the
third
scene
takes
place
on
a
heath
edgar
flying
from
the
persecutions
of
his
father
hides
in
a
wood
and
tells
the
public
what
kind
of
lunatics
exist
there
beggars
who
go
about
naked
thrust
wooden
pricks
and
pins
into
their
flesh
scream
with
wild
voices
and
enforce
charity
and
says
that
he
wishes
to
simulate
such
a
lunatic
in
order
to
save
himself
from
persecution
having
communicated
this
to
the
public
he
retires
the
fourth
scene
is
again
before
gloucester
castle
enter
lear
and
the
fool
lear
sees
kent
in
the
stocks
and
still
not
recognizing
him
is
inflamed
with
rage
against
those
who
dared
so
to
insult
his
messenger
and
calls
for
the
duke
and
regan
the
fool
goes
on
with
his
jokes
lear
with
difficulty
restrains
his
ire
enter
the
duke
and
regan
lear
complains
of
goneril
but
regan
justifies
her
sister
lear
curses
goneril
and
when
regan
tells
him
he
had
better
return
to
her
sister
he
is
indignant
and
says
ask
her
forgiveness
and
falls
down
on
his
knees
demonstrating
how
indecent
it
would
be
if
he
were
abjectly
to
beg
food
and
clothing
as
charity
from
his
own
daughter
and
he
curses
goneril
with
the
strangest
curses
and
asks
who
put
his
servant
in
the
stocks
before
regan
can
answer
goneril
arrives
lear
becomes
yet
more
exasperated
and
again
curses
goneril
but
when
he
is
told
that
it
was
the
duke
himself
who
ordered
the
stocks
he
does
not
say
anything
because
at
this
moment
regan
tells
him
that
she
can
not
receive
him
now
and
that
he
had
best
return
to
goneril
and
that
in
a
month
time
she
herself
will
receive
him
with
however
not
a
hundred
but
fifty
servants
lear
again
curses
goneril
and
does
not
want
to
go
to
her
continuing
to
hope
that
regan
will
accept
him
with
the
whole
hundred
servants
but
regan
says
she
will
receive
him
only
with
and
then
lear
makes
up
his
mind
to
go
back
to
goneril
who
admits
fifty
but
when
goneril
says
that
even
are
too
many
lear
pours
forth
a
long
argument
about
the
superfluous
and
the
needful
being
relative
and
says
that
if
man
is
not
allowed
more
than
he
needs
he
is
not
to
be
distinguished
from
a
beast
lear
or
rather
the
actor
who
plays
part
adds
that
there
is
no
need
for
a
lady
finery
which
does
not
keep
her
warm
after
this
he
flies
into
a
mad
fury
and
says
that
to
take
vengeance
on
his
daughters
he
will
do
something
dreadful
but
that
he
will
not
weep
and
so
he
departs
a
storm
begins
such
is
the
second
act
full
of
unnatural
events
and
yet
more
unnatural
speeches
not
flowing
from
the
position
of
the
characters
and
finishing
with
a
scene
between
lear
and
his
daughters
which
might
have
been
powerful
if
it
had
not
been
permeated
with
the
most
absurdly
foolish
unnatural
speeches
which
moreover
have
no
relation
to
the
subject
put
into
the
mouth
of
lear
lear
vacillations
between
pride
anger
and
the
hope
of
his
daughters
giving
in
would
be
exceedingly
touching
if
it
were
not
spoilt
by
the
verbose
absurdities
to
which
he
gives
vent
about
being
ready
to
divorce
himself
from
regan
dead
mother
should
regan
not
be
glad
to
receive
him
or
about
his
calling
down
fen
suck
frogs
which
he
invokes
upon
the
head
of
his
daughter
or
about
the
heavens
being
obliged
to
patronize
old
people
because
they
themselves
are
old
the
third
act
begins
with
thunder
lightning
a
storm
of
some
special
kind
such
as
according
to
the
words
of
the
characters
in
the
piece
had
never
before
taken
place
on
the
heath
a
gentleman
tells
kent
that
lear
banished
by
his
daughters
from
their
homes
is
running
about
the
heath
alone
tearing
his
hair
and
throwing
it
to
the
wind
and
that
none
but
the
fool
is
with
him
in
return
kent
tells
the
gentleman
that
the
dukes
have
quarrelled
and
that
the
french
army
has
landed
at
dover
and
having
communicated
this
intelligence
he
dispatches
the
gentleman
to
dover
to
meet
cordelia
the
second
scene
of
the
third
act
also
takes
place
on
the
heath
but
in
another
part
of
it
lear
walks
about
the
heath
and
says
words
which
are
meant
to
express
his
despair
he
desires
that
the
winds
should
blow
so
hard
that
they
should
crack
their
cheeks
and
that
the
rain
should
flood
everything
that
lightning
should
singe
his
white
head
and
the
thunder
flatten
the
world
and
destroy
all
germens
that
make
ungrateful
man
the
fool
keeps
uttering
still
more
senseless
words
enter
kent
lear
says
that
for
some
reason
during
this
storm
all
criminals
shall
be
found
out
and
convicted
kent
still
unrecognized
by
lear
endeavors
to
persuade
him
to
take
refuge
in
a
hovel
at
this
point
the
fool
pronounces
a
prophecy
in
no
wise
related
to
the
situation
and
they
all
depart
the
third
scene
is
again
transferred
to
gloucester
castle
gloucester
tells
edmund
that
the
french
king
has
already
landed
with
his
troops
and
intends
to
help
lear
learning
this
edmund
decides
to
accuse
his
father
of
treason
in
order
that
he
may
get
his
heritage
the
fourth
scene
is
again
on
the
heath
in
front
of
the
hovel
kent
invites
lear
into
the
hovel
but
lear
answers
that
he
has
no
reason
to
shelter
himself
from
the
tempest
that
he
does
not
feel
it
having
a
tempest
in
his
mind
called
forth
by
the
ingratitude
of
his
daughters
which
extinguishes
all
else
this
true
feeling
expressed
in
simple
words
might
elicit
sympathy
but
amidst
the
incessant
pompous
raving
it
escapes
one
and
loses
its
significance
the
hovel
into
which
lear
is
led
turns
out
to
be
the
same
which
edgar
has
entered
disguised
as
a
madman
naked
edgar
comes
out
of
the
hovel
and
altho
all
have
known
him
no
one
recognizes
him
as
no
one
recognizes
kent
and
edgar
lear
and
the
fool
begin
to
say
senseless
things
which
continue
with
interruptions
for
many
pages
in
the
middle
of
this
scene
enter
gloucester
who
also
does
not
recognize
either
kent
or
his
son
edgar
and
tells
them
how
his
son
edgar
wanted
to
kill
him
this
scene
is
again
cut
short
by
another
in
gloucester
castle
during
which
edmund
betrays
his
father
and
the
duke
promises
to
avenge
himself
on
gloucester
then
the
scene
shifts
back
to
lear
kent
edgar
gloucester
lear
and
the
fool
are
at
a
farm
and
talking
edgar
says
frateretto
calls
me
and
tells
me

an
angler
in
the
lake
of
darkness
the
fool
says
tell
me
whether
a
madman
be
a
gentleman
or
a
yeoman
lear
having
lost
his
mind
says
that
the
madman
is
a
king
the
fool
says
no
the
madman
is
the
yeoman
who
has
allowed
his
son
to
become
a
gentleman
lear
screams
to
have
a
thousand
with
red
burning
spirits
come
hissing
in
upon
while
edgar
shrieks
that
the
foul
fiend
bites
his
back
at
this
the
fool
remarks
that
one
can
not
believe
in
the
tameness
of
a
wolf
a
horse
health
a
boy
love
or
a
oath
then
lear
imagines
he
is
judging
his
daughters
sit

he
addressing
the
naked
edgar

edgar
goes
on
in
his
own
strain
kent
suggests
that
lear
should
lie
down
but
lear
continues
his
imaginary
trial

in
their
evidence
he
cries

corruption

place
false
justice
why

let

this
raving
terminates
by
lear
falling
asleep
and
gloucester
persuading
kent
still
without
recognizing
him
to
carry
lear
to
dover
and
kent
and
the
fool
carry
off
the
king
the
scene
is
transferred
to
gloucester
castle
gloucester
himself
is
about
to
be
accused
of
treason
he
is
brought
forward
and
bound
the
duke
of
cornwall
plucks
out
one
of
his
eyes
and
sets
his
foot
on
it
regan
says
one
side
will
mock
another
the
other
too
the
duke
wishes
to
pluck
the
other
out
also
but
some
servant
for
some
reason
suddenly
takes
gloucester
part
and
wounds
the
duke
regan
kills
the
servant
who
dying
says
to
gloucester
that
he
has
one
eye
left
to
see
some
mischief
on
him
the
duke
says
lest
it
see
more
prevent
it
and
he
tears
out
gloucester
other
eye
and
throws
it
on
the
ground
here
regan
says
that
it
was
edmund
who
betrayed
his
father
and
then
gloucester
immediately
understands
that
he
has
been
deceived
and
that
edgar
did
not
wish
to
kill
him
thus
ends
the
third
act
the
fourth
act
is
again
on
the
heath
edgar
still
attired
as
a
lunatic
soliloquizes
in
stilted
terms
about
the
instability
of
fortune
and
the
advantages
of
a
humble
lot
then
there
comes
to
him
somehow
into
the
very
place
on
the
heath
where
he
is
his
father
the
blinded
gloucester
led
by
an
old
man
in
that
characteristic
shakespearean
language
the
chief
peculiarity
of
which
is
that
the
thoughts
are
bred
either
by
the
consonance
or
the
contrasts
of
words
gloucester
also
speaks
about
the
instability
of
fortune
he
tells
the
old
man
who
leads
him
to
leave
him
but
the
old
man
points
out
to
him
that
he
can
not
his
way
gloucester
says
he
has
no
way
and
therefore
does
not
require
and
he
argues
about
his
having
stumbled
when
he
and
about
defects
often
proving
commodities
ah
dear
son
edgar
he
adds
might
i
but
live
to
thee
in
my
touch
i
say
i
had
again
edgar
naked
and
in
the
character
of
a
lunatic
hearing
this
still
does
not
disclose
himself
to
his
father
he
takes
the
place
of
the
aged
guide
and
talks
with
his
father
who
does
not
recognize
his
voice
but
regards
him
as
a
wandering
madman
gloucester
avails
himself
of
the
opportunity
to
deliver
himself
of
a
witticism
is
the
times
plague
when
madmen
lead
the
blind
and
he
insists
on
dismissing
the
old
man
obviously
not
from
motives
which
might
be
natural
to
gloucester
at
that
moment
but
merely
in
order
when
left
alone
with
edgar
to
enact
the
later
scene
of
the
imaginary
leaping
from
the
cliff
notwithstanding
edgar
has
just
seen
his
blinded
father
and
has
learnt
that
his
father
repents
of
having
banished
him
he
puts
in
utterly
unnecessary
interjections
which
shakespeare
might
know
having
read
them
in
haronet
book
but
which
edgar
had
no
means
of
becoming
acquainted
with
and
above
all
which
it
was
quite
unnatural
for
him
to
repeat
in
his
present
position
he
says
five
friends
have
been
in
poor
tom
at
once
of
lust
as
obidient
hobbididance
prince
of
dumbness
mahu
of
stealing
modo
of
murder
flibbertigibbet
of
mopping
and
mowing
who
since
possesses
chambermaids
and
waiting
women
hearing
these
words
gloucester
makes
a
present
of
his
purse
to
edgar
saying
that
i
am
so
wretched
makes
thee
the
happier
heavens
deal
so
still
let
the
superfluous
and
man
that
slaves
your
ordinance
that
will
not
see
because
he
doth
not
feel
feel
your
power
quickly
so
distribution
should
undo
excess
and
each
man
have
enough
having
pronounced
these
strange
words
the
blind
gloucester
requests
edgar
to
lead
him
to
a
certain
cliff
overhanging
the
sea
and
they
depart
the
second
scene
of
the
fourth
act
takes
place
before
the
duke
of
albany
palace
goneril
is
not
only
cruel
but
also
depraved
she
despises
her
husband
and
discloses
her
love
to
the
villain
edmund
who
has
inherited
the
title
of
his
father
gloucester
edmund
leaves
and
a
conversation
takes
place
between
goneril
and
her
husband
the
duke
of
albany
the
only
figure
with
human
feelings
who
had
already
previously
been
dissatisfied
with
his
wife
treatment
of
her
father
now
resolutely
takes
lear
side
but
expresses
his
emotion
in
such
words
as
to
shake
one
confidence
in
his
feeling
he
says
that
a
bear
would
lick
lear
reverence
that
if
the
heavens
do
not
send
their
visible
spirits
to
tame
these
vile
offenses
humanity
must
prey
on
itself
like
monsters
etc
goneril
does
not
listen
to
him
and
then
he
begins
to
abuse
her
see
thyself
devil
proper
deformity
seems
not
in
the
fiend
so
horrid
as
in
woman
o
vain
fool
says
goneril
thou
changed
and
thing
for
shame
continues
the
duke
not
thy
feature
my
fitness
to
let
these
hands
obey
my
blood
they
are
apt
enough
to
dislocate
and
tear
thy
flesh
and
bones
thou
art
a
fiend
a
woman
shape
doth
shield
thee
after
this
a
messenger
enters
and
announces
that
the
duke
of
cornwall
wounded
by
his
servant
whilst
plucking
out
gloucester
eyes
had
died
goneril
is
glad
but
already
anticipates
with
fear
that
regan
now
a
widow
will
deprive
her
of
edmund
here
the
second
scene
ends
the
third
scene
of
the
fourth
act
represents
the
french
camp
from
a
conversation
between
kent
and
a
gentleman
the
reader
or
spectator
learns
that
the
king
of
france
is
not
in
the
camp
and
that
cordelia
has
received
a
letter
from
kent
and
is
greatly
grieved
by
what
she
has
learned
about
her
father
the
gentleman
says
that
her
face
reminded
one
of
sunshine
and
rain
her
smiles
and
tears
were
like
a
better
day
those
happy
smiles
that
play
on
her
ripe
lip
seem
not
to
know
what
guests
were
in
her
eyes
which
parted
thence
as
pearls
from
diamonds
dropp
and
so
forth
the
gentleman
says
that
cordelia
desires
to
see
her
father
but
kent
says
that
lear
is
ashamed
of
seeing
this
daughter
whom
he
has
treated
so
unkindly
in
the
fourth
scene
cordelia
talking
with
a
physician
tells
him
that
lear
has
been
seen
that
he
is
quite
mad
wearing
on
his
head
a
wreath
of
various
weeds
that
he
is
roaming
about
and
that
she
has
sent
soldiers
in
search
of
him
adding
that
she
desires
all
secret
remedies
to
spring
with
her
tears
and
the
like
she
is
informed
that
the
forces
of
the
dukes
are
approaching
but
she
is
concerned
only
about
her
father
and
departs
the
fifth
scene
of
the
fourth
act
lies
in
gloucester
castle
regan
is
talking
with
oswald
goneril
steward
who
is
carrying
a
letter
from
goneril
to
edmund
and
she
announces
to
him
that
she
also
loves
edmund
and
that
being
a
widow
it
is
better
for
her
to
marry
him
than
for
goneril
to
do
so
and
she
begs
him
to
persuade
her
sister
of
this
further
she
tells
him
that
it
was
very
unreasonable
to
blind
gloucester
and
yet
leave
him
alive
and
therefore
advises
oswald
should
he
meet
gloucester
to
kill
him
promising
him
a
great
reward
if
he
does
this
in
the
sixth
scene
gloucester
again
appears
with
his
still
unrecognized
son
edgar
who
now
in
the
guise
of
a
peasant
pretends
to
lead
his
father
to
the
cliff
gloucester
is
walking
along
on
level
land
but
edgar
persuades
him
that
they
are
with
difficulty
ascending
a
steep
hill
gloucester
believes
this
edgar
tells
his
father
that
the
noise
of
the
sea
is
heard
gloucester
believes
this
also
edgar
stops
on
a
level
place
and
persuades
his
father
that
he
has
ascended
the
cliff
and
that
in
front
of
him
lies
a
dreadful
abyss
and
leaves
him
alone
gloucester
addressing
the
gods
says
that
he
shakes
off
his
affliction
as
he
can
bear
it
no
longer
and
that
he
does
not
condemn
them
the
gods
having
said
this
he
leaps
on
the
level
ground
and
falls
imagining
that
he
has
jumped
off
the
cliff
on
this
occasion
edgar
soliloquizing
gives
vent
to
a
yet
more
entangled
utterance
i
know
not
how
conceit
may
rob
the
treasury
of
life
when
life
itself
yields
to
the
theft
had
he
been
where
he
thought
by
this
had
thought
been
past
he
approaches
gloucester
in
the
character
of
yet
a
different
person
and
expressing
astonishment
at
the
latter
not
being
hurt
by
his
fall
from
such
a
dreadful
height
gloucester
believes
that
he
has
fallen
and
prepares
to
die
but
he
feels
that
he
is
alive
and
begins
to
doubt
that
he
has
fallen
from
such
a
height
then
edgar
persuades
him
that
he
has
indeed
jumped
from
the
dreadful
height
and
tells
him
that
the
individual
who
had
been
with
him
at
the
top
was
the
devil
as
he
had
eyes
like
two
full
moons
and
a
thousand
noses
and
wavy
horns
gloucester
believes
this
and
is
persuaded
that
his
despair
was
the
work
of
the
devil
and
therefore
decides
that
he
will
henceforth
despair
no
more
but
will
quietly
await
death
hereupon
enters
lear
for
some
reason
covered
with
he
has
lost
his
senses
and
says
things
wilder
than
before
he
speaks
about
coining
about
the
moon
gives
some
one
a
yard
then
he
cries
that
he
sees
a
mouse
which
he
wishes
to
entice
by
a
piece
of
cheese
then
he
suddenly
demands
the
password
from
edgar
and
edgar
immediately
answers
him
with
the
words
sweet
marjoram
lear
says
pass
and
the
blind
gloucester
who
has
not
recognized
either
his
son
or
kent
recognizes
the
king
voice
then
the
king
after
his
disconnected
utterances
suddenly
begins
to
speak
ironically
about
flatterers
who
agreed
to
all
he
said
ay
and
no
too
was
no
good
divinity
but
when
he
got
into
a
storm
without
shelter
he
saw
all
this
was
not
true
and
then
goes
on
to
say
that
as
all
creation
addicts
itself
to
adultery
and
gloucester
bastard
son
had
treated
his
father
more
kindly
than
his
daughters
had
treated
him
altho
lear
according
to
the
development
of
the
drama
could
not
know
how
edmund
had
treated
gloucester
therefore
let
dissoluteness
prosper
the
more
so
as
being
a
king
he
needs
soldiers
he
here
addresses
an
imaginary
hypocritically
virtuous
lady
who
acts
the
prude
whereas
the
fitchew
nor
the
soiled
horse
goes
with
a
more
riotous
appetite
all
women
inherit
the
gods
only
to
the
girdle
beneath
is
all
the
fiend
and
saying
this
lear
screams
and
spits
from
horror
this
monolog
is
evidently
meant
to
be
addressed
by
the
actor
to
the
audience
and
probably
produces
an
effect
on
the
stage
but
it
is
utterly
uncalled
for
in
the
mouth
of
lear
equally
with
his
words
it
smells
of
mortality
uttered
while
wiping
his
hand
as
gloucester
expresses
a
desire
to
kiss
it
then
gloucester
blindness
is
referred
to
which
gives
occasion
for
a
play
of
words
on
about
blind
cupid
at
which
lear
says
to
gloucester
no
in
your
head
nor
no
money
in
your
your
are
in
a
case
your
purse
in
a
then
lear
declaims
a
monolog
on
the
unfairness
of
legal
judgment
which
is
quite
out
of
place
in
the
mouth
of
the
insane
lear
after
this
enter
a
gentleman
with
attendants
sent
by
cordelia
to
fetch
her
father
lear
continues
to
act
as
a
madman
and
runs
away
the
gentleman
sent
to
fetch
lear
does
not
run
after
him
but
lengthily
describes
to
edgar
the
position
of
the
french
and
british
armies
oswald
enters
and
seeing
gloucester
and
desiring
to
receive
the
reward
promised
by
regan
attacks
him
but
edgar
with
his
club
kills
oswald
who
in
dying
transmits
to
his
murderer
edgar
goneril
letter
to
edmund
the
delivery
of
which
would
insure
reward
in
this
letter
goneril
promises
to
kill
her
husband
and
marry
edmund
edgar
drags
out
oswald
body
by
the
legs
and
then
returns
and
leads
his
father
away
the
seventh
scene
of
the
fourth
act
takes
place
in
a
tent
in
the
french
camp
lear
is
asleep
on
a
bed
enter
cordelia
and
kent
still
in
disguise
lear
is
awakened
by
the
music
and
seeing
cordelia
does
not
believe
she
is
a
living
being
thinks
she
is
an
apparition
does
not
believe
that
he
himself
is
alive
cordelia
assures
him
that
she
is
his
daughter
and
begs
him
to
bless
her
he
falls
on
his
knees
before
her
begs
her
pardon
acknowledges
that
he
is
as
old
and
foolish
says
he
is
ready
to
take
poison
which
he
thinks
she
has
probably
prepared
for
him
as
he
is
persuaded
she
must
hate
him
for
your
sisters
he
says
have
done
me
wrong
you
have
some
cause
they
have
not
then
he
gradually
comes
to
his
senses
and
ceases
to
rave
his
daughter
suggests
that
he
should
take
a
walk
he
consents
and
says
you
must
bear
with
me
pray
you
now
forget
and
forgive
i
am
old
and
foolish
they
depart
the
gentleman
and
kent
remaining
on
the
scene
hold
a
conversation
which
explains
to
the
spectator
that
edmund
is
at
the
head
of
the
troops
and
that
a
battle
must
soon
begin
between
lear
defenders
and
his
enemies
so
the
fourth
act
closes
in
this
fourth
act
the
scene
between
lear
and
his
daughter
might
have
been
touching
if
it
had
not
been
preceded
in
the
course
of
the
earlier
acts
by
the
tediously
drawn
out
monotonous
ravings
of
lear
and
if
moreover
this
expression
of
his
feelings
constituted
the
last
scene
but
the
scene
is
not
the
last
in
the
fifth
act
the
former
coldly
pompous
artificial
ravings
of
lear
go
on
again
destroying
the
impression
which
the
previous
scene
might
have
produced
the
first
scene
of
the
fifth
act
at
first
represents
edmund
and
regan
the
latter
is
jealous
of
her
sister
and
makes
an
offer
then
come
goneril
her
husband
and
some
soldiers
the
duke
of
albany
altho
pitying
lear
regards
it
as
his
duty
to
fight
with
the
french
who
have
invaded
his
country
and
so
he
prepares
for
battle
then
edgar
enters
still
disguised
and
hands
to
the
duke
of
albany
the
letter
he
had
received
from
goneril
dying
steward
and
tells
him
if
he
gains
the
victory
to
sound
the
trumpet
saying
that
he
can
produce
a
champion
who
will
confirm
the
contents
of
the
letter
in
the
second
scene
edgar
enters
leading
his
father
gloucester
seats
him
by
a
tree
and
goes
away
himself
the
noise
of
battle
is
heard
edgar
runs
back
and
says
that
the
battle
is
lost
and
lear
and
cordelia
are
prisoners
gloucester
again
falls
into
despair
edgar
still
without
disclosing
himself
to
his
father
counsels
endurance
and
gloucester
immediately
agrees
with
him
the
third
scene
opens
with
a
triumphal
progress
of
the
victor
edmund
lear
and
cordelia
are
prisoners
lear
altho
no
longer
insane
continues
to
utter
the
same
senseless
inappropriate
words
as
for
example
that
in
prison
he
will
sing
with
cordelia
she
will
ask
his
blessing
and
he
will
kneel
down
this
process
of
kneeling
down
is
repeated
three
times
and
will
ask
her
forgiveness
and
he
further
says
that
while
they
are
living
in
prison
they
will
wear
out
packs
and
sects
of
great
ones
that
he
and
cordelia
are
sacrifices
upon
which
the
gods
will
throw
incense
and
that
he
that
parts
them
shall
bring
a
brand
from
heaven
and
fire
them
like
foxes
that
he
will
not
weep
and
that
the
plague
shall
sooner
devour
his
eyes
flesh
and
fell
than
they
shall
make
them
weep
edmund
orders
lear
and
his
daughter
to
be
led
away
to
prison
and
having
called
the
officer
to
do
this
says
he
requires
another
duty
and
asks
him
whether
he
do
it
the
captain
says
he
can
not
draw
a
cart
nor
eat
dried
oats
but
if
it
be
men
work
he
can
do
it
enter
the
duke
of
albany
goneril
and
regan
the
duke
of
albany
wishes
to
champion
lear
but
edmund
does
not
allow
it
the
daughters
take
part
in
the
dialog
and
begin
to
abuse
each
other
being
jealous
of
edmund
here
everything
becomes
so
confused
that
it
is
difficult
to
follow
the
action
the
duke
of
albany
wishes
to
arrest
edmund
and
tells
regan
that
edmund
has
long
ago
entered
into
guilty
relations
with
his
wife
and
that
therefore
regan
must
give
up
her
claims
on
edmund
and
if
she
wishes
to
marry
should
marry
him
the
duke
of
albany
having
said
this
the
duke
of
albany
calls
edmund
orders
the
trumpet
to
be
sounded
saying
that
if
no
one
appears
he
will
fight
him
himself
here
regan
whom
goneril
has
evidently
poisoned
falls
deadly
sick
trumpets
are
sounded
and
edgar
enters
with
a
vizor
concealing
his
face
and
without
giving
his
name
challenges
edmund
edgar
abuses
edmund
edmund
throws
all
the
abuses
back
on
edgar
head
they
fight
and
edmund
falls
goneril
is
in
despair
the
duke
of
albany
shows
goneril
her
letter
goneril
departs
the
dying
edmund
discovers
that
his
opponent
was
his
brother
edgar
raises
his
vizor
and
pronounces
a
moral
lesson
to
the
effect
that
having
begotten
his
illegitimate
son
edmund
the
father
has
paid
for
it
with
his
eyesight
after
this
edgar
tells
the
duke
of
albany
his
adventures
and
how
he
has
only
just
now
before
entering
on
the
recent
combat
disclosed
everything
to
his
father
and
the
father
could
not
bear
it
and
died
from
emotion
edmund
is
not
yet
dead
and
wants
to
know
all
that
has
taken
place
then
edgar
relates
that
while
he
was
sitting
over
his
father
body
a
man
came
and
closely
embraced
him
and
shouting
as
loudly
as
if
he
wished
to
burst
heaven
threw
himself
on
the
body
of
edgar
father
and
told
the
most
piteous
tale
about
lear
and
himself
and
that
while
relating
this
the
strings
of
life
began
to
crack
but
at
this
moment
the
trumpet
sounded
twice
and
edgar
left
him
tranced
and
this
was
kent
edgar
has
hardly
finished
this
narrative
when
a
gentleman
rushes
in
with
a
bloody
knife
shouting
help
in
answer
to
the
question
who
is
killed
the
gentleman
says
that
goneril
has
been
killed
having
poisoned
her
sister
she
has
confessed
it
enters
kent
and
at
this
moment
the
corpses
of
goneril
and
regan
are
brought
in
edmund
here
says
that
the
sisters
evidently
loved
him
as
one
has
poisoned
the
other
for
his
sake
and
then
slain
herself
at
the
same
time
he
confesses
that
he
had
given
orders
to
kill
lear
and
to
hang
cordelia
in
prison
and
pretend
that
she
had
taken
her
own
life
but
now
he
wishes
to
prevent
these
deeds
and
having
said
this
he
dies
and
is
carried
away
after
this
enters
lear
with
the
dead
cordelia
in
his
arms
altho
he
is
more
than
eighty
years
old
and
again
begins
lear
awful
ravings
at
which
one
feels
ashamed
as
at
unsuccessful
jokes
lear
demands
that
all
should
howl
and
alternately
believes
that
cordelia
is
dead
and
that
she
is
alive
had
i
your
tongues
and
eyes
he
says
i
use
them
so
that
vault
should
crack
then
he
says
that
he
killed
the
slave
who
hanged
cordelia
next
he
says
that
his
eyes
see
badly
but
at
the
same
time
he
recognizes
kent
whom
all
along
he
had
not
recognized
the
duke
of
albany
says
that
he
will
resign
during
the
life
of
lear
and
that
he
will
reward
edgar
and
kent
and
all
who
have
been
faithful
to
him
at
this
moment
the
news
is
brought
that
edmund
is
dead
and
lear
continuing
his
ravings
begs
that
they
will
undo
one
of
his
buttons
the
same
request
which
he
had
made
when
roaming
about
the
heath
he
expresses
his
thanks
for
this
tells
everyone
to
look
at
something
and
thereupon
dies
in
conclusion
the
duke
of
albany
having
survived
the
others
says
the
weight
of
this
sad
time
we
must
obey
speak
what
we
feel
not
what
we
ought
to
say
the
oldest
hath
borne
most
we
that
are
young
shall
never
see
so
much
nor
live
so
long
all
depart
to
the
music
of
a
dead
march
thus
ends
the
fifth
act
and
the
drama
iii
such
is
this
celebrated
drama
however
absurd
it
may
appear
in
my
rendering
which
i
have
endeavored
to
make
as
impartial
as
possible
i
may
confidently
say
that
in
the
original
it
is
yet
more
absurd
for
any
man
of
our
time
if
he
were
not
under
the
hypnotic
suggestion
that
this
drama
is
the
height
of
perfection
it
would
be
enough
to
read
it
to
its
end
were
he
to
have
sufficient
patience
for
this
to
be
convinced
that
far
from
being
the
height
of
perfection
it
is
a
very
bad
carelessly
composed
production
which
if
it
could
have
been
of
interest
to
a
certain
public
at
a
certain
time
can
not
evoke
among
us
anything
but
aversion
and
weariness
every
reader
of
our
time
who
is
free
from
the
influence
of
suggestion
will
also
receive
exactly
the
same
impression
from
all
the
other
extolled
dramas
of
shakespeare
not
to
mention
the
senseless
dramatized
tales
pericles
twelfth
night
the
tempest
cymbeline
troilus
and
cressida
but
such
individuals
not
inoculated
with
are
no
longer
to
be
found
in
our
christian
society
every
man
of
our
society
and
time
from
the
first
period
of
his
conscious
life
has
been
inoculated
with
the
idea
that
shakespeare
is
a
genius
a
poet
and
a
dramatist
and
that
all
his
writings
are
the
height
of
perfection
yet
however
hopeless
it
may
seem
i
will
endeavor
to
demonstrate
in
the
selected
drama
king
lear
all
those
faults
equally
characteristic
also
of
all
the
other
tragedies
and
comedies
of
shakespeare
on
account
of
which
he
not
only
is
not
representing
a
model
of
dramatic
art
but
does
not
satisfy
the
most
elementary
demands
of
art
recognized
by
all
dramatic
art
according
to
the
laws
established
by
those
very
critics
who
extol
shakespeare
demands
that
the
persons
represented
in
the
play
should
be
in
consequence
of
actions
proper
to
their
characters
and
owing
to
a
natural
course
of
events
placed
in
positions
requiring
them
to
struggle
with
the
surrounding
world
to
which
they
find
themselves
in
opposition
and
in
this
struggle
should
display
their
inherent
qualities
in
king
lear
the
persons
represented
are
indeed
placed
externally
in
opposition
to
the
outward
world
and
they
struggle
with
it
but
their
strife
does
not
flow
from
the
natural
course
of
events
nor
from
their
own
characters
but
is
quite
arbitrarily
established
by
the
author
and
therefore
can
not
produce
on
the
reader
the
illusion
which
represents
the
essential
condition
of
art
lear
has
no
necessity
or
motive
for
his
abdication
also
having
lived
all
his
life
with
his
daughters
has
no
reason
to
believe
the
words
of
the
two
elders
and
not
the
truthful
statement
of
the
youngest
yet
upon
this
is
built
the
whole
tragedy
of
his
position
similarly
unnatural
is
the
subordinate
action
the
relation
of
gloucester
to
his
sons
the
positions
of
gloucester
and
edgar
flow
from
the
circumstance
that
gloucester
just
like
lear
immediately
believes
the
coarsest
untruth
and
does
not
even
endeavor
to
inquire
of
his
injured
son
whether
what
he
is
accused
of
be
true
but
at
once
curses
and
banishes
him
the
fact
that
lear
relations
with
his
daughters
are
the
same
as
those
of
gloucester
to
his
sons
makes
one
feel
yet
more
strongly
that
in
both
cases
the
relations
are
quite
arbitrary
and
do
not
flow
from
the
characters
nor
the
natural
course
of
events
equally
unnatural
and
obviously
invented
is
the
fact
that
all
through
the
tragedy
lear
does
not
recognize
his
old
courtier
kent
and
therefore
the
relations
between
lear
and
kent
fail
to
excite
the
sympathy
of
the
reader
or
spectator
the
same
in
a
yet
greater
degree
holds
true
of
the
position
of
edgar
who
unrecognized
by
any
one
leads
his
blind
father
and
persuades
him
that
he
has
leapt
off
a
cliff
when
in
reality
gloucester
jumps
on
level
ground
these
positions
into
which
the
characters
are
placed
quite
arbitrarily
are
so
unnatural
that
the
reader
or
spectator
is
unable
not
only
to
sympathize
with
their
sufferings
but
even
to
be
interested
in
what
he
reads
or
sees
this
in
the
first
place
secondly
in
this
as
in
the
other
dramas
of
shakespeare
all
the
characters
live
think
speak
and
act
quite
unconformably
with
the
given
time
and
place
the
action
of
king
lear
takes
place
years
and
yet
the
characters
are
placed
in
conditions
possible
only
in
the
middle
ages
participating
in
the
drama
are
kings
dukes
armies
and
illegitimate
children
and
gentlemen
courtiers
doctors
farmers
officers
soldiers
and
knights
with
vizors
etc
it
is
possible
that
such
anachronisms
with
which
shakespeare
dramas
abound
did
not
injure
the
possibility
of
illusion
in
the
sixteenth
century
and
the
beginning
of
the
seventeenth
but
in
our
time
it
is
no
longer
possible
to
follow
with
interest
the
development
of
events
which
one
knows
could
not
take
place
in
the
conditions
which
the
author
describes
in
detail
the
artificiality
of
the
positions
not
flowing
from
the
natural
course
of
events
or
from
the
nature
of
the
characters
and
their
want
of
conformity
with
time
and
space
is
further
increased
by
those
coarse
embellishments
which
are
continually
added
by
shakespeare
and
intended
to
appear
particularly
touching
the
extraordinary
storm
during
which
king
lear
roams
about
the
heath
or
the
grass
which
for
some
reason
he
puts
on
his
head
like
ophelia
in
hamlet
or
edgar
attire
or
the
fool
speeches
or
the
appearance
of
the
helmeted
horseman
edgar
all
these
effects
not
only
fail
to
enhance
the
impression
but
produce
an
opposite
effect
man
sieht
die
absicht
und
man
wird
verstimmt
as
goethe
says
it
often
happens
that
even
during
these
obviously
intentional
efforts
after
effect
as
for
instance
the
dragging
out
by
the
legs
of
half
a
dozen
corpses
with
which
all
shakespeare
tragedies
terminate
instead
of
feeling
fear
and
pity
one
is
tempted
rather
to
laugh
iv
but
it
is
not
enough
that
shakespeare
characters
are
placed
in
tragic
positions
which
are
impossible
do
not
flow
from
the
course
of
events
are
inappropriate
to
time
and
space
these
personages
besides
this
act
in
a
way
which
is
out
of
keeping
with
their
definite
character
and
is
quite
arbitrary
it
is
generally
asserted
that
in
shakespeare
dramas
the
characters
are
specially
well
expressed
that
notwithstanding
their
vividness
they
are
like
those
of
living
people
that
while
exhibiting
the
characteristics
of
a
given
individual
they
at
the
same
time
wear
the
features
of
man
in
general
it
is
usual
to
say
that
the
delineation
of
character
in
shakespeare
is
the
height
of
perfection
this
is
asserted
with
such
confidence
and
repeated
by
all
as
indisputable
truth
but
however
much
i
endeavored
to
find
confirmation
of
this
in
shakespeare
dramas
i
always
found
the
opposite
in
reading
any
of
shakespeare
dramas
whatever
i
was
from
the
very
first
instantly
convinced
that
he
was
lacking
in
the
most
important
if
not
the
only
means
of
portraying
characters
individuality
of
language
the
style
of
speech
of
every
person
being
natural
to
his
character
this
is
absent
from
shakespeare
all
his
characters
speak
not
their
own
but
always
one
and
the
same
shakespearian
pretentious
and
unnatural
language
in
which
not
only
they
could
not
speak
but
in
which
no
living
man
ever
has
spoken
or
does
speak
no
living
men
could
or
can
say
as
lear
says
that
he
would
divorce
his
wife
in
the
grave
should
regan
not
receive
him
or
that
the
heavens
would
crack
with
shouting
or
that
the
winds
would
burst
or
that
the
wind
wishes
to
blow
the
land
into
the
sea
or
that
the
curled
waters
wish
to
flood
the
shore
as
the
gentleman
describes
the
storm
or
that
it
is
easier
to
bear
one
grief
and
the
soul
leaps
over
many
sufferings
when
grief
finds
fellowship
or
that
lear
has
become
childless
while
i
am
fatherless
as
edgar
says
or
use
similar
unnatural
expressions
with
which
the
speeches
of
all
the
characters
in
all
shakespeare
dramas
overflow
again
it
is
not
enough
that
all
the
characters
speak
in
a
way
in
which
no
living
men
ever
did
or
could
speak
they
all
suffer
from
a
common
intemperance
of
language
those
who
are
in
love
who
are
preparing
for
death
who
are
fighting
who
are
dying
all
alike
speak
much
and
unexpectedly
about
subjects
utterly
inappropriate
to
the
occasion
being
evidently
guided
rather
by
consonances
and
play
of
words
than
by
thoughts
they
speak
all
alike
lear
raves
exactly
as
does
edgar
when
feigning
madness
both
kent
and
the
fool
speak
alike
the
words
of
one
of
the
personages
might
be
placed
in
the
mouth
of
another
and
by
the
character
of
the
speech
it
would
be
impossible
to
distinguish
who
speaks
if
there
is
a
difference
in
the
speech
of
shakespeare
various
characters
it
lies
merely
in
the
different
dialogs
which
are
pronounced
for
these
characters
again
by
shakespeare
and
not
by
themselves
thus
shakespeare
always
speaks
for
kings
in
one
and
the
same
inflated
empty
language
also
in
one
and
the
same
shakespearian
artificially
sentimental
language
speak
all
the
women
who
are
intended
to
be
poetic
juliet
desdemona
cordelia
imogen
marina
in
the
same
way
also
it
is
shakespeare
alone
who
speaks
for
his
villains
richard
edmund
iago
macbeth
expressing
for
them
those
vicious
feelings
which
villains
never
express
yet
more
similar
are
the
speeches
of
the
madmen
with
their
horrible
words
and
those
of
fools
with
their
mirthless
puns
so
that
in
shakespeare
there
is
no
language
of
living
individuals
that
language
which
in
the
drama
is
the
chief
means
of
setting
forth
character
if
gesticulation
be
also
a
means
of
expressing
character
as
in
ballets
this
is
only
a
secondary
means
moreover
if
the
characters
speak
at
random
and
in
a
random
way
and
all
in
one
and
the
same
diction
as
is
the
case
in
shakespeare
work
then
even
the
action
of
gesticulation
is
wasted
therefore
whatever
the
blind
panegyrists
of
shakespeare
may
say
in
shakespeare
there
is
no
expression
of
character
those
personages
who
in
his
dramas
stand
out
as
characters
are
characters
borrowed
by
him
from
former
works
which
have
served
as
the
foundation
of
his
dramas
and
they
are
mostly
depicted
not
by
the
dramatic
method
which
consists
in
making
each
person
speak
with
his
own
diction
but
in
the
epic
method
of
one
person
describing
the
features
of
another
the
perfection
with
which
shakespeare
expresses
character
is
asserted
chiefly
on
the
ground
of
the
characters
of
lear
cordelia
othello
desdemona
falstaff
and
hamlet
but
all
these
characters
as
well
as
all
the
others
instead
of
belonging
to
shakespeare
are
taken
by
him
from
dramas
chronicles
and
romances
anterior
to
him
all
these
characters
not
only
are
not
rendered
more
powerful
by
him
but
in
most
cases
they
are
weakened
and
spoilt
this
is
very
striking
in
this
drama
of
king
lear
which
we
are
examining
taken
by
him
from
the
drama
king
leir
by
an
unknown
author
the
characters
of
this
drama
that
of
king
lear
and
especially
of
cordelia
not
only
were
not
created
by
shakespeare
but
have
been
strikingly
weakened
and
deprived
of
force
by
him
as
compared
with
their
appearance
in
the
older
drama
in
the
older
drama
leir
abdicates
because
having
become
a
widower
he
thinks
only
of
saving
his
soul
he
asks
his
daughters
as
to
their
love
for
him
that
by
means
of
a
certain
device
he
has
invented
he
may
retain
his
favorite
daughter
on
his
island
the
elder
daughters
are
betrothed
while
the
youngest
does
not
wish
to
contract
a
loveless
union
with
any
of
the
neighboring
suitors
whom
leir
proposes
to
her
and
he
is
afraid
that
she
may
marry
some
distant
potentate
the
device
which
he
has
invented
as
he
informs
his
courtier
perillus
shakespeare
kent
is
this
that
when
cordelia
tells
him
that
she
loves
him
more
than
any
one
or
as
much
as
her
elder
sisters
do
he
will
tell
her
that
she
must
in
proof
of
her
love
marry
the
prince
he
will
indicate
on
his
island
all
these
motives
for
lear
conduct
are
absent
in
shakespeare
play
then
when
according
to
the
old
drama
leir
asks
his
daughters
about
their
love
for
him
cordelia
does
not
say
as
shakespeare
has
it
that
she
will
not
give
her
father
all
her
love
but
will
love
her
husband
too
should
she
marry
which
is
quite
unnatural
but
simply
says
that
she
can
not
express
her
love
in
words
but
hopes
that
her
actions
will
prove
it
goneril
and
regan
remark
that
cordelia
answer
is
not
an
answer
and
that
the
father
can
not
meekly
accept
such
indifference
so
that
what
is
wanting
in
shakespeare
the
explanation
of
lear
anger
which
caused
him
to
disinherit
his
youngest
daughter
exists
in
the
old
drama
leir
is
annoyed
by
the
failure
of
his
scheme
and
the
poisonous
words
of
his
eldest
daughters
irritate
him
still
more
after
the
division
of
the
kingdom
between
the
elder
daughters
there
follows
in
the
older
drama
a
scene
between
cordelia
and
the
king
of
gaul
setting
forth
instead
of
the
colorless
cordelia
of
shakespeare
a
very
definite
and
attractive
character
of
the
truthful
tender
and
youngest
daughter
while
cordelia
without
grieving
that
she
has
been
deprived
of
a
portion
of
the
heritage
sits
sorrowing
at
having
lost
her
love
and
looking
forward
to
earn
her
bread
by
her
labor
there
comes
the
king
of
gaul
who
in
the
disguise
of
a
pilgrim
desires
to
choose
a
bride
from
among
leir
daughters
he
asks
cordelia
why
she
is
sad
she
tells
him
the
cause
of
her
grief
the
king
of
gaul
still
in
the
guise
of
a
pilgrim
falls
in
love
with
her
and
offers
to
arrange
a
marriage
for
her
with
the
king
of
gaul
but
she
says
she
will
marry
only
a
man
whom
she
loves
then
the
pilgrim
still
disguised
offers
her
his
hand
and
heart
and
cordelia
confesses
she
loves
the
pilgrim
and
consents
to
marry
him
notwithstanding
the
poverty
that
awaits
her
then
the
pilgrim
discloses
to
her
that
he
it
is
who
is
the
king
of
gaul
and
cordelia
marries
him
instead
of
this
scene
lear
according
to
shakespeare
offers
cordelia
two
suitors
to
take
her
without
dowry
and
one
cynically
refuses
while
the
other
one
does
not
know
why
accepts
her
after
this
in
the
old
drama
as
in
shakespeare
leir
undergoes
the
insults
of
goneril
into
whose
house
he
has
removed
but
he
bears
these
insults
in
a
very
different
way
from
that
represented
by
shakespeare
he
feels
that
by
his
conduct
toward
cordelia
he
has
deserved
this
and
humbly
submits
as
in
shakespeare
drama
so
also
in
the
older
drama
the
courtiers
perillus
kent
who
had
interceded
for
cordelia
and
was
therefore
banished
comes
to
leir
and
assures
him
of
his
love
but
under
no
disguise
but
simply
as
a
faithful
old
servant
who
does
not
abandon
his
king
in
a
moment
of
need
leir
tells
him
what
according
to
shakespeare
he
tells
cordelia
in
the
last
scene
that
if
the
daughters
whom
he
has
benefited
hate
him
a
retainer
to
whom
he
has
done
no
good
can
not
love
him
but
perillus
kent
assures
the
king
of
his
love
toward
him
and
leir
pacified
goes
on
to
regan
in
the
older
drama
there
are
no
tempests
nor
tearing
out
of
gray
hairs
but
there
is
the
weakened
and
humbled
old
man
leir
overpowered
with
grief
and
banished
by
his
other
daughter
also
who
even
wishes
to
kill
him
turned
out
by
his
elder
daughters
leir
according
to
the
older
drama
as
a
last
resource
goes
with
perillus
to
cordelia
instead
of
the
unnatural
banishment
of
lear
during
the
tempest
and
his
roaming
about
the
heath
leir
with
perillus
in
the
older
drama
during
their
journey
to
france
very
naturally
reach
the
last
degree
of
destitution
sell
their
clothes
in
order
to
pay
for
their
crossing
over
the
sea
and
in
the
attire
of
fishermen
exhausted
by
cold
and
hunger
approach
cordelia
house
here
again
instead
of
the
unnatural
combined
ravings
of
the
fool
lear
and
edgar
as
represented
by
shakespeare
there
follows
in
the
older
drama
a
natural
scene
of
reunion
between
the
daughter
and
the
father
cordelia
who
notwithstanding
her
happiness
has
all
the
time
been
grieving
about
her
father
and
praying
to
god
to
forgive
her
sisters
who
had
done
him
so
much
wrong
meets
her
father
in
his
extreme
want
and
wishes
immediately
to
disclose
herself
to
him
but
her
husband
advises
her
not
to
do
this
in
order
not
to
agitate
her
weak
father
she
accepts
the
counsel
and
takes
leir
into
her
house
without
disclosing
herself
to
him
and
nurses
him
leir
gradually
revives
and
then
the
daughter
asks
him
who
he
is
and
how
he
lived
formerly
if
from
the
first
says
leir
i
should
relate
the
cause
i
would
make
a
heart
of
adamant
to
weep
and
thou
poor
soul
as
thou
art
dost
weep
already
ere
i
do
begin
cordelia
for
god
love
tell
it
and
when
you
have
done
i
tell
the
reason
why
i
weep
so
soon
and
leir
relates
all
he
has
suffered
from
his
elder
daughters
and
says
that
now
he
wishes
to
find
shelter
with
the
child
who
would
be
in
the
right
even
were
she
to
condemn
him
to
death
if
however
he
says
she
will
receive
me
with
love
it
will
be
god
and
her
work
but
not
my
merit
to
this
cordelia
says
oh
i
know
for
certain
that
thy
daughter
will
lovingly
receive
thee
how
canst
thou
know
this
without
knowing
her
says
leir
i
know
says
cordelia
because
not
far
from
here
i
had
a
father
who
acted
toward
me
as
badly
as
thou
hast
acted
toward
her
yet
if
i
were
only
to
see
his
white
head
i
would
creep
to
meet
him
on
my
knees
no
this
can
not
be
says
leir
for
there
are
no
children
in
the
world
so
cruel
as
mine
do
not
condemn
all
for
the
sins
of
some
says
cordelia
and
falls
on
her
knees
look
here
dear
father
she
says
look
on
me
i
am
thy
loving
daughter
the
father
recognizes
her
and
says
it
is
not
for
thee
but
for
me
to
beg
thy
pardon
on
my
knees
for
all
my
sins
toward
thee
is
there
anything
approaching
this
exquisite
scene
in
drama
however
strange
this
opinion
may
seem
to
worshipers
of
shakespeare
yet
the
whole
of
this
old
drama
is
incomparably
and
in
every
respect
superior
to
shakespeare
adaptation
it
is
so
first
because
it
has
not
got
the
utterly
superfluous
characters
of
the
villain
edmund
and
unlifelike
gloucester
and
edgar
who
only
distract
one
attention
secondly
because
it
has
not
got
the
completely
false
effects
of
lear
running
about
the
heath
his
conversations
with
the
fool
and
all
these
impossible
disguises
failures
to
recognize
and
accumulated
deaths
and
above
all
because
in
this
drama
there
is
the
simple
natural
and
deeply
touching
character
of
leir
and
the
yet
more
touching
and
clearly
defined
character
of
cordelia
both
absent
in
shakespeare
therefore
there
is
in
the
older
drama
instead
of
shakespeare
scene
of
lear
interview
with
cordelia
and
of
cordelia
unnecessary
murder
the
exquisite
scene
of
the
interview
between
leir
and
cordelia
unequaled
by
any
in
all
shakespeare
dramas
the
old
drama
also
terminates
more
naturally
and
more
in
accordance
with
the
moral
demands
of
the
spectator
than
does
shakespeare
namely
by
the
king
of
the
gauls
conquering
the
husbands
of
the
elder
sisters
and
cordelia
instead
of
being
killed
restoring
leir
to
his
former
position
thus
it
is
in
the
drama
we
are
examining
which
shakespeare
has
borrowed
from
the
drama
king
leir
so
it
is
also
with
othello
taken
from
an
italian
romance
the
same
also
with
the
famous
hamlet
the
same
with
antony
brutus
cleopatra
shylock
richard
and
all
characters
all
taken
from
some
antecedent
work
shakespeare
while
profiting
by
characters
already
given
in
preceding
dramas
or
romances
chronicles
or
plutarch
lives
not
only
fails
to
render
them
more
truthful
and
vivid
as
his
eulogists
affirm
but
on
the
contrary
always
weakens
them
and
often
completely
destroys
them
as
with
lear
compelling
his
characters
to
commit
actions
unnatural
to
them
and
above
all
to
utter
speeches
natural
neither
to
them
nor
to
any
one
whatever
thus
in
othello
altho
that
is
perhaps
i
will
not
say
the
best
but
the
least
bad
and
the
least
encumbered
by
pompous
volubility
the
characters
of
othello
iago
cassio
emilia
according
to
shakespeare
are
much
less
natural
and
lifelike
than
in
the
italian
romance
shakespeare
othello
suffers
from
epilepsy
of
which
he
has
an
attack
on
the
stage
moreover
in
shakespeare
version
murder
is
preceded
by
the
strange
vow
of
the
kneeling
othello
othello
according
to
shakespeare
is
a
negro
and
not
a
moor
all
this
is
erratic
inflated
unnatural
and
violates
the
unity
of
the
character
all
this
is
absent
in
the
romance
in
that
romance
the
reasons
for
othello
jealousy
are
represented
more
naturally
than
in
shakespeare
in
the
romance
cassio
knowing
whose
the
handkerchief
is
goes
to
desdemona
to
return
it
but
approaching
the
of
house
sees
othello
and
flies
from
him
othello
perceives
the
escaping
cassio
and
this
more
than
anything
confirms
his
suspicions
shakespeare
has
not
got
this
and
yet
this
casual
incident
explains
othello
jealousy
more
than
anything
else
with
shakespeare
this
jealousy
is
founded
entirely
on
iago
persistent
successful
machinations
and
treacherous
words
which
othello
blindly
believes
othello
monolog
over
the
sleeping
desdemona
about
his
desiring
her
when
killed
to
look
as
she
is
alive
about
his
going
to
love
her
even
dead
and
now
wishing
to
smell
her
balmy
breath
is
utterly
impossible
a
man
who
is
preparing
for
the
murder
of
a
beloved
being
does
not
utter
such
phrases
still
less
after
committing
the
murder
would
he
speak
about
the
necessity
of
an
eclipse
of
sun
and
moon
and
of
the
globe
yawning
nor
can
he
negro
tho
he
may
be
address
devils
inviting
them
to
burn
him
in
hot
sulphur
and
so
forth
lastly
however
effective
may
be
the
suicide
absent
in
the
romance
it
completely
destroys
the
conception
of
his
clearly
defined
character
if
he
indeed
suffered
from
grief
and
remorse
he
would
not
intending
to
kill
himself
pronounce
phrases
about
his
own
services
about
the
pearl
and
about
his
eyes
dropping
tears
fast
as
the
arabian
trees
their
medicinal
and
yet
less
about
the
turk
beating
an
italian
and
how
he
othello
smote
him
so
that
notwithstanding
the
powerful
expression
of
emotion
in
othello
when
under
the
influence
of
hints
jealousy
rises
in
him
and
again
in
his
scenes
with
desdemona
one
conception
of
othello
character
is
constantly
infringed
by
his
false
pathos
and
the
unnatural
speeches
he
pronounces
so
it
is
with
the
chief
character
othello
but
notwithstanding
its
alteration
and
the
disadvantageous
features
which
it
is
made
thereby
to
present
in
comparison
with
the
character
from
which
it
was
taken
in
the
romance
this
character
still
remains
a
character
but
all
the
other
personages
are
completely
spoiled
by
shakespeare
iago
according
to
shakespeare
is
an
unmitigated
villain
deceiver
and
thief
a
robber
who
robs
roderigo
and
always
succeeds
even
in
his
most
impossible
designs
and
therefore
is
a
person
quite
apart
from
real
life
in
shakespeare
the
motive
of
his
villainy
is
first
that
othello
did
not
give
him
the
post
he
desired
secondly
that
he
suspects
othello
of
an
intrigue
with
his
wife
and
thirdly
that
as
he
says
he
feels
a
strange
kind
of
love
for
desdemona
there
are
many
motives
but
they
are
all
vague
whereas
in
the
romance
there
is
but
one
simple
and
clear
motive
iago
passionate
love
for
desdemona
transmitted
into
hatred
toward
her
and
othello
after
she
had
preferred
the
moor
to
him
and
resolutely
repulsed
him
yet
more
unnatural
is
the
utterly
unnecessary
roderigo
whom
iago
deceives
and
robs
promising
him
desdemona
love
and
whom
he
forces
to
fulfil
all
he
commands
to
intoxicate
cassio
provoke
and
then
kill
cassio
emilia
who
says
anything
it
may
occur
to
the
author
to
put
into
her
mouth
has
not
even
the
slightest
semblance
of
a
live
character
but
falstaff
the
wonderful
falstaff
shakespeare
eulogists
will
say
of
him
at
all
events
one
can
not
say
that
he
is
not
a
living
character
or
that
having
been
taken
from
the
comedy
of
an
unknown
author
it
has
been
weakened
falstaff
like
all
shakespeare
characters
was
taken
from
a
drama
or
comedy
by
an
unknown
author
written
on
a
really
living
person
sir
john
oldcastle
who
had
been
the
friend
of
some
duke
this
oldcastle
had
once
been
convicted
of
heresy
but
had
been
saved
by
his
friend
the
duke
but
afterward
he
was
condemned
and
burned
at
the
stake
for
his
religious
beliefs
which
did
not
conform
with
catholicism
it
was
on
this
same
oldcastle
that
an
anonymous
author
in
order
to
please
the
catholic
public
wrote
a
comedy
or
drama
ridiculing
this
martyr
for
his
faith
and
representing
him
as
a
man
the
boon
companion
of
the
duke
and
it
is
from
this
comedy
that
shakespeare
borrowed
not
only
the
character
of
falstaff
but
also
his
own
ironical
attitude
toward
it
in
shakespeare
first
works
when
this
character
appeared
it
was
frankly
called
oldcastle
but
later
in
elizabeth
time
when
protestantism
again
triumphed
it
was
awkward
to
bring
out
with
mockery
a
martyr
in
the
strife
with
catholicism
and
besides
relatives
had
protested
and
shakespeare
accordingly
altered
the
name
of
oldcastle
to
that
of
falstaff
also
a
historical
figure
known
for
having
fled
from
the
field
of
battle
at
agincourt
falstaff
is
indeed
quite
a
natural
and
typical
character
but
then
it
is
perhaps
the
only
natural
and
typical
character
depicted
by
shakespeare
and
this
character
is
natural
and
typical
because
of
all
shakespeare
characters
it
alone
speaks
a
language
proper
to
itself
and
it
speaks
thus
because
it
speaks
in
that
same
shakespearian
language
full
of
mirthless
jokes
and
unamusing
puns
which
being
unnatural
to
all
shakespeare
other
characters
is
quite
in
harmony
with
the
boastful
distorted
and
depraved
character
of
the
drunken
falstaff
for
this
reason
alone
does
this
figure
truly
represent
a
definite
character
unfortunately
the
artistic
effect
of
this
character
is
spoilt
by
the
fact
that
it
is
so
repulsive
by
its
gluttony
drunkenness
debauchery
rascality
deceit
and
cowardice
that
it
is
difficult
to
share
the
feeling
of
gay
humor
with
which
the
author
treats
it
thus
it
is
with
falstaff
but
in
none
of
shakespeare
figures
is
his
i
will
not
say
incapacity
to
give
but
utter
indifference
to
giving
his
personages
a
typical
character
so
strikingly
manifest
as
in
hamlet
and
in
connection
with
none
of
shakespeare
works
do
we
see
so
strikingly
displayed
that
blind
worship
of
shakespeare
that
unreasoning
state
of
hypnotism
owing
to
which
the
mere
thought
even
is
not
admitted
that
any
of
productions
can
be
wanting
in
genius
or
that
any
of
the
principal
personages
in
his
dramas
can
fail
to
be
the
expression
of
a
new
and
deeply
conceived
character
shakespeare
takes
an
old
story
not
bad
in
its
way
relating
avec
quelle
ruse
amlette
qui
depuis
fut
roy
de
dannemarch
vengea
la
mort
de
son
père
horwendille
occis
par
fengon
son
frère
et
autre
occurrence
de
son
histoire
or
a
drama
which
was
written
on
this
theme
fifteen
years
before
him
on
this
subject
he
writes
his
own
drama
introducing
quite
inappropriately
as
indeed
he
always
does
into
the
mouth
of
the
principal
person
all
those
thoughts
of
his
own
which
appeared
to
him
worthy
of
attention
and
putting
into
the
mouth
of
his
hero
these
thoughts
about
life
the
about
death
to
be
or
not
to
be
the
same
which
are
expressed
in
his
sonnet
about
the
theater
about
women
he
is
utterly
unconcerned
as
to
the
circumstances
under
which
these
words
are
said
and
it
naturally
turns
out
that
the
person
expressing
all
these
thoughts
is
a
mere
phonograph
of
shakespeare
without
character
whose
actions
and
words
do
not
agree
in
the
old
legend
hamlet
personality
is
quite
comprehensible
he
is
indignant
at
his
mother
and
his
uncle
deeds
and
wishes
to
revenge
himself
upon
them
but
is
afraid
his
uncle
may
kill
him
as
he
had
killed
his
father
therefore
he
simulates
insanity
desiring
to
bide
his
time
and
observe
all
that
goes
on
in
the
palace
meanwhile
his
uncle
and
mother
being
afraid
of
him
wish
to
test
whether
he
is
feigning
or
is
really
mad
and
send
to
him
a
girl
whom
he
loves
he
persists
then
sees
his
mother
in
private
kills
a
courtier
who
was
eavesdropping
and
convicts
his
mother
of
her
sin
afterward
he
is
sent
to
england
but
intercepts
letters
and
returning
from
england
takes
revenge
of
his
enemies
burning
them
all
all
this
is
comprehensible
and
flows
from
hamlet
character
and
position
but
shakespeare
putting
into
hamlet
mouth
speeches
which
he
himself
wishes
to
express
and
making
him
commit
actions
which
are
necessary
to
the
author
in
order
to
produce
scenic
effects
destroys
all
that
constitutes
the
character
of
hamlet
and
of
the
legend
during
the
whole
of
the
drama
hamlet
is
doing
not
what
he
would
really
wish
to
do
but
what
is
necessary
for
the
author
plan
one
moment
he
is
at
his
father
ghost
another
moment
he
begins
to
chaff
it
calling
it
old
mole
one
moment
he
loves
ophelia
another
moment
he
teases
her
and
so
forth
there
is
no
possibility
of
finding
any
explanation
whatever
of
hamlet
actions
or
words
and
therefore
no
possibility
of
attributing
any
character
to
him
but
as
it
is
recognized
that
shakespeare
the
genius
can
not
write
anything
bad
therefore
learned
people
use
all
the
powers
of
their
minds
to
find
extraordinary
beauties
in
what
is
an
obvious
and
crying
failure
demonstrated
with
especial
vividness
in
hamlet
where
the
principal
figure
has
no
character
whatever
and
lo
profound
critics
declare
that
in
this
drama
in
the
person
of
hamlet
is
expressed
singularly
powerful
perfectly
novel
and
deep
personality
existing
in
this
person
having
no
character
and
that
precisely
in
this
absence
of
character
consists
the
genius
of
creating
a
deeply
conceived
character
having
decided
this
learned
critics
write
volumes
upon
volumes
so
that
the
praise
and
explanation
of
the
greatness
and
importance
of
the
representation
of
the
character
of
a
man
who
has
no
character
form
in
volume
a
library
it
is
true
that
some
of
the
critics
timidly
express
the
idea
that
there
is
something
strange
in
this
figure
that
hamlet
is
an
unsolved
riddle
but
no
one
has
the
courage
to
say
as
in
hans
andersen
story
that
the
king
is
naked
that
it
is
as
clear
as
day
that
shakespeare
did
not
succeed
and
did
not
even
wish
to
give
any
character
to
hamlet
did
not
even
understand
that
this
was
necessary
and
learned
critics
continue
to
investigate
and
extol
this
puzzling
production
which
reminds
one
of
the
famous
stone
with
an
inscription
which
pickwick
found
near
a
cottage
doorstep
and
which
divided
the
scientific
world
into
two
hostile
camps
so
that
neither
do
the
characters
of
lear
nor
othello
nor
falstaff
nor
yet
hamlet
in
any
way
confirm
the
existing
opinion
that
power
consists
in
the
delineation
of
character
if
in
shakespeare
dramas
one
does
meet
figures
having
certain
characteristic
features
for
the
most
part
secondary
figures
such
as
polonius
in
hamlet
and
portia
in
the
merchant
of
venice
these
few
lifelike
characters
among
five
hundred
or
more
other
secondary
figures
with
the
complete
absence
of
character
in
the
principal
figures
do
not
at
all
prove
that
the
merit
of
shakespeare
dramas
consists
in
the
expression
of
character
that
a
great
talent
for
depicting
character
is
attributed
to
shakespeare
arises
from
his
actually
possessing
a
peculiarity
which
for
superficial
observers
and
in
the
play
of
good
actors
may
appear
to
be
the
capacity
of
depicting
character
this
peculiarity
consists
in
the
capacity
of
representative
scenes
expressing
the
play
of
emotion
however
unnatural
the
positions
may
be
in
which
he
places
his
characters
however
improper
to
them
the
language
which
he
makes
them
speak
however
featureless
they
are
the
very
play
of
emotion
its
increase
and
alteration
and
the
combination
of
many
contrary
feelings
as
expressed
correctly
and
powerfully
in
some
of
shakespeare
scenes
and
in
the
play
of
good
actors
evokes
even
if
only
for
a
time
sympathy
with
the
persons
represented
shakespeare
himself
an
actor
and
an
intelligent
man
knew
how
to
express
by
the
means
not
only
of
speech
but
of
exclamation
gesture
and
the
repetition
of
words
states
of
mind
and
developments
or
changes
of
feeling
taking
place
in
the
persons
represented
so
that
in
many
instances
shakespeare
characters
instead
of
speaking
merely
make
an
exclamation
or
weep
or
in
the
middle
of
a
monolog
by
means
of
gestures
demonstrate
the
pain
of
their
position
just
as
lear
asks
some
one
to
unbutton
him
or
in
moments
of
great
agitation
repeat
a
question
several
times
or
several
times
demand
the
repetition
of
a
word
which
has
particularly
struck
them
as
do
othello
macduff
cleopatra
and
others
such
clever
methods
of
expressing
the
development
of
feeling
giving
good
actors
the
possibility
of
demonstrating
their
powers
were
and
are
often
mistaken
by
many
critics
for
the
expression
of
character
but
however
strongly
the
play
of
feeling
may
be
expressed
in
one
scene
a
single
scene
can
not
give
the
character
of
a
figure
when
this
figure
after
a
correct
exclamation
or
gesture
begins
in
a
language
not
its
own
at
the
author
arbitrary
will
to
volubly
utter
words
which
are
neither
necessary
nor
in
harmony
with
its
character
v
well
but
the
profound
utterances
and
sayings
expressed
by
shakespeare
characters
shakespeare
panegyrists
will
retort
see
lear
monolog
on
punishment
kent
speech
about
vengeance
or
about
his
former
life
gloucester
reflections
on
the
instability
of
fortune
and
in
other
dramas
the
famous
monologs
of
hamlet
antony
and
others
thoughts
and
sayings
may
be
appreciated
i
will
answer
in
a
prose
work
in
an
essay
a
collection
of
aphorisms
but
not
in
an
artistic
dramatic
production
the
object
of
which
is
to
elicit
sympathy
with
that
which
is
represented
therefore
the
monologs
and
sayings
of
shakespeare
even
did
they
contain
very
many
deep
and
new
thoughts
which
they
do
not
do
not
constitute
the
merits
of
an
artistic
poetic
production
on
the
contrary
these
speeches
expressed
in
unnatural
conditions
can
only
spoil
artistic
works
an
artistic
poetic
work
particularly
a
drama
must
first
of
all
excite
in
the
reader
or
spectator
the
illusion
that
whatever
the
person
represented
is
living
through
or
experiencing
is
lived
through
or
experienced
by
himself
for
this
purpose
it
is
as
important
for
the
dramatist
to
know
precisely
what
he
should
make
his
characters
both
do
and
say
as
what
he
should
not
make
them
say
and
do
so
as
not
to
destroy
the
illusion
of
the
reader
or
spectator
speeches
however
eloquent
and
profound
they
may
be
when
put
into
the
mouth
of
dramatic
characters
if
they
be
superfluous
or
unnatural
to
the
position
and
character
destroy
the
chief
condition
of
dramatic
art
the
illusion
owing
to
which
the
reader
or
spectator
lives
in
the
feelings
of
the
persons
represented
without
putting
an
end
to
the
illusion
one
may
leave
much
unsaid
the
reader
or
spectator
will
himself
fill
this
up
and
sometimes
owing
to
this
his
illusion
is
even
increased
but
to
say
what
is
superfluous
is
the
same
as
to
overthrow
a
statue
composed
of
separate
pieces
and
thereby
scatter
them
or
to
take
away
the
lamp
from
a
magic
lantern
the
attention
of
the
reader
or
spectator
is
distracted
the
reader
sees
the
author
the
spectator
sees
the
actor
the
illusion
disappears
and
to
restore
it
is
sometimes
impossible
therefore
without
the
feeling
of
measure
there
can
not
be
an
artist
and
especially
a
dramatist
shakespeare
is
devoid
of
this
feeling
his
characters
continually
do
and
say
what
is
not
only
unnatural
to
them
but
utterly
unnecessary
i
do
not
cite
examples
of
this
because
i
believe
that
he
who
does
not
himself
see
this
striking
deficiency
in
all
shakespeare
dramas
will
not
be
persuaded
by
any
examples
and
proofs
it
is
sufficient
to
read
king
lear
alone
with
its
insanity
murders
plucking
out
of
eyes
gloucester
jump
its
poisonings
and
wranglings
not
to
mention
pericles
cymbeline
the
winter
tale
the
tempest
to
be
convinced
of
this
only
a
man
devoid
of
the
sense
of
measure
and
of
taste
could
produce
such
types
as
titus
andronicus
or
troilus
and
cressida
or
so
mercilessly
mutilate
the
old
drama
king
leir
gervinus
endeavors
to
prove
that
shakespeare
possessed
the
feeling
of
beauty
schönheit
sinn
but
all
gervinus
proofs
prove
only
that
he
himself
gervinus
is
completely
destitute
of
it
in
shakespeare
everything
is
exaggerated
the
actions
are
exaggerated
so
are
their
consequences
the
speeches
of
the
characters
are
exaggerated
and
therefore
at
every
step
the
possibility
of
artistic
impression
is
interfered
with
whatever
people
may
say
however
they
may
be
enraptured
by
shakespeare
works
whatever
merits
they
may
attribute
to
them
it
is
perfectly
certain
that
he
was
not
an
artist
and
that
his
works
are
not
artistic
productions
without
the
sense
of
measure
there
never
was
nor
can
be
an
artist
as
without
the
feeling
of
rhythm
there
can
not
be
a
musician
shakespeare
might
have
been
whatever
you
like
but
he
was
not
an
artist
but
one
should
not
forget
the
time
at
which
shakespeare
wrote
say
his
admirers
it
was
a
time
of
cruel
and
coarse
habits
a
time
of
the
then
fashionable
euphemism
artificial
way
of
expressing
oneself
a
time
of
forms
of
life
strange
to
us
and
therefore
to
judge
about
shakespeare
one
should
have
in
view
the
time
when
he
wrote
in
homer
as
in
shakespeare
there
is
much
which
is
strange
to
us
but
this
does
not
prevent
us
from
appreciating
the
beauties
of
homer
say
these
admirers
but
in
comparing
shakespeare
with
homer
as
does
gervinus
that
infinite
distance
which
separates
true
poetry
from
its
semblance
manifests
itself
with
especial
force
however
distant
homer
is
from
us
we
can
without
the
slightest
effort
transport
ourselves
into
the
life
he
describes
and
we
can
thus
transport
ourselves
because
however
alien
to
us
may
be
the
events
homer
describes
he
believes
in
what
he
says
and
speaks
seriously
and
therefore
he
never
exaggerates
and
the
sense
of
measure
never
abandons
him
this
is
the
reason
why
not
to
speak
of
the
wonderfully
distinct
lifelike
and
beautiful
characters
of
achilles
hector
priam
odysseus
and
the
eternally
touching
scenes
of
of
priam
embassy
of
odysseus
return
and
others
the
whole
of
the
iliad
and
still
more
the
odyssey
are
so
humanly
near
to
us
that
we
feel
as
if
we
ourselves
had
lived
and
are
living
among
its
gods
and
heroes
not
so
with
shakespeare
from
his
first
words
exaggeration
is
seen
the
exaggeration
of
events
the
exaggeration
of
emotion
and
the
exaggeration
of
effects
one
sees
at
once
that
he
does
not
believe
in
what
he
says
that
it
is
of
no
necessity
to
him
that
he
invents
the
events
he
describes
and
is
indifferent
to
his
characters
that
he
has
conceived
them
only
for
the
stage
and
therefore
makes
them
do
and
say
only
what
may
strike
his
public
and
therefore
we
do
not
believe
either
in
the
events
or
in
the
actions
or
in
the
sufferings
of
the
characters
nothing
demonstrates
so
clearly
the
complete
absence
of
esthetic
feeling
in
shakespeare
as
comparison
between
him
and
homer
the
works
which
we
call
the
works
of
homer
are
artistic
poetic
original
works
lived
through
by
the
author
or
authors
whereas
the
works
of
shakespeare
borrowed
as
they
are
and
externally
like
mosaics
artificially
fitted
together
piecemeal
from
bits
invented
for
the
occasion
have
nothing
whatever
in
common
with
art
and
poetry
vi
but
perhaps
the
height
of
shakespeare
conception
of
life
is
such
that
tho
he
does
not
satisfy
the
esthetic
demands
he
discloses
to
us
a
view
of
life
so
new
and
important
for
men
that
in
consideration
of
its
importance
all
his
failures
as
an
artist
become
imperceptible
so
indeed
say
shakespeare
admirers
gervinus
says
distinctly
that
besides
shakespeare
significance
in
the
sphere
of
dramatic
poetry
in
which
according
to
his
opinion
shakespeare
equals
homer
in
the
sphere
of
epos
shakespeare
being
the
very
greatest
judge
of
the
human
soul
represents
a
teacher
of
most
indisputable
ethical
authority
and
the
most
select
leader
in
the
world
and
in
life
in
what
then
consists
this
indisputable
authority
of
the
most
select
leader
in
the
world
and
in
life
gervinus
devotes
the
concluding
chapter
of
his
second
volume
about
fifty
pages
to
an
explanation
of
this
the
ethical
authority
of
this
supreme
teacher
of
life
consists
in
the
following
the
starting
point
of
shakespeare
conception
of
life
says
gervinus
is
that
man
is
gifted
with
powers
of
activity
and
therefore
first
of
all
according
to
gervinus
shakespeare
regarded
it
as
good
and
necessary
for
man
that
he
should
act
as
if
it
were
possible
for
a
man
not
to
act

active
people
like
fortinbras
bolingbroke
alcibiades
octavius
says
gervinus
are
placed
in
contrast
by
shakespeare
with
various
characters
who
do
not
exhibit
energetic
activity
and
happiness
and
success
according
to
shakespeare
are
attained
by
individuals
possessing
this
active
character
not
at
all
owing
to
the
superiority
of
their
nature
on
the
contrary
notwithstanding
their
inferior
gifts
the
capacity
of
activity
itself
always
gives
them
the
advantage
over
inactivity
quite
independent
of
any
consideration
whether
the
inactivity
of
some
persons
flows
from
excellent
impulses
and
the
activity
of
others
from
bad
ones
activity
is
good
inactivity
is
evil
activity
transforms
evil
into
good
says
shakespeare
according
to
gervinus
shakespeare
prefers
the
principle
of
alexander
of
macedonia
to
that
of
diogenes
says
gervinus
in
other
words
he
prefers
death
and
murder
due
to
ambition
to
abstinence
and
wisdom
according
to
gervinus
shakespeare
believes
that
humanity
need
not
set
up
ideals
but
that
only
healthy
activity
and
the
golden
mean
are
necessary
in
everything
indeed
shakespeare
is
so
penetrated
by
this
conviction
that
according
to
gervinus
assertion
he
allows
himself
to
deny
even
christian
morality
which
makes
exaggerated
demands
on
human
nature
shakespeare
as
we
read
did
not
approve
of
limits
of
duty
exceeding
the
intentions
of
nature
he
teaches
the
golden
mean
between
heathen
hatred
to
one
enemies
and
christian
love
toward
them
pp
how
far
shakespeare
was
penetrated
with
this
fundamental
principle
of
says
gervinus
can
be
seen
from
the
fact
that
he
has
the
courage
to
express
himself
even
against
the
christian
rules
which
prompt
human
nature
to
the
excessive
exertion
of
its
powers
he
did
not
admit
that
the
limits
of
duties
should
exceed
the
biddings
of
nature
therefore
he
preached
a
reasonable
mean
natural
to
man
between
christian
and
heathen
precepts
of
love
toward
enemies
on
the
one
hand
and
hatred
toward
them
on
the
other
that
one
may
do
too
much
good
exceed
the
reasonable
limits
of
good
is
convincingly
proved
by
shakespeare
words
and
examples
thus
excessive
generosity
ruins
timon
while
antonio
moderate
generosity
confers
honor
normal
ambition
makes
henry
great
whereas
it
ruins
percy
in
whom
it
has
risen
too
high
excessive
virtue
leads
angelo
to
destruction
and
if
in
those
who
surround
him
excessive
severity
becomes
harmful
and
can
not
prevent
crime
on
the
other
hand
the
divine
element
in
man
even
charity
if
it
be
excessive
can
create
crime
shakespeare
taught
says
gervinus
that
one
be
too
he
teaches
that
morality
like
politics
is
a
matter
in
which
owing
to
the
complexity
of
circumstances
and
motives
one
can
not
establish
any
principles
and
in
this
he
agrees
with
bacon
and
aristotle
there
are
no
positive
religious
and
moral
laws
which
may
create
principles
for
correct
moral
conduct
suitable
for
all
cases
gervinus
most
clearly
expresses
the
whole
of
shakespeare
moral
theory
by
saying
that
shakespeare
does
not
write
for
those
classes
for
whom
definite
religious
principles
and
laws
are
suitable
for
nine
hundred
and
of
men
but
for
the
educated
there
are
classes
of
men
whose
morality
is
best
guarded
by
the
positive
precepts
of
religion
and
state
law
to
such
persons
creations
are
inaccessible
they
are
comprehensible
and
accessible
only
to
the
educated
from
whom
one
can
expect
that
they
should
acquire
the
healthy
tact
of
life
and
by
means
of
which
the
innate
guiding
powers
of
conscience
and
reason
uniting
with
the
will
lead
us
to
the
definite
attainment
of
worthy
aims
in
life
but
even
for
such
educated
people
shakespeare
teaching
is
not
always
without
danger
the
condition
on
which
his
teaching
is
quite
harmless
is
that
it
should
be
accepted
in
all
its
completeness
in
all
its
parts
without
any
omission
then
it
is
not
only
without
danger
but
is
the
most
clear
and
faultless
and
therefore
the
most
worthy
of
confidence
of
all
moral
teaching
in
order
thus
to
accept
all
one
should
understand
that
according
to
his
teaching
it
is
stupid
and
harmful
for
the
individual
to
revolt
against
or
endeavor
to
overthrow
the
limits
of
established
religious
and
state
forms
shakespeare
says
gervinus
would
abhor
an
independent
and
free
individual
who
with
a
powerful
spirit
should
struggle
against
all
convention
in
politics
and
morality
and
overstep
that
union
between
religion
and
the
state
which
has
for
thousands
of
years
supported
society
according
to
his
views
the
practical
wisdom
of
men
could
not
have
a
higher
object
than
the
introduction
into
society
of
the
greatest
spontaneity
and
freedom
but
precisely
because
of
this
one
should
safeguard
as
sacred
and
irrefragable
the
natural
laws
of
society
one
should
respect
the
existing
order
of
things
and
continually
verifying
it
inculcate
its
rational
sides
not
overlooking
nature
for
the
sake
of
culture
or
property
the
family
the
state
are
sacred
but
aspiration
toward
the
recognition
of
the
equality
of
men
is
insanity
its
realization
would
bring
humanity
to
the
greatest
calamities
no
one
struggled
more
than
shakespeare
against
the
privileges
of
rank
and
position
but
could
this
freethinking
man
resign
himself
to
the
privileges
of
the
wealthy
and
educated
being
destroyed
in
order
to
give
room
to
the
poor
and
ignorant
how
could
a
man
who
so
eloquently
attracts
people
toward
honors
permit
that
the
very
aspiration
toward
that
which
was
great
be
crushed
together
with
rank
and
distinction
for
services
and
with
the
destruction
of
all
degrees
the
motives
for
all
high
undertakings
be
stifled
even
if
the
attraction
of
honors
and
false
power
treacherously
obtained
were
to
cease
could
the
poet
admit
of
the
most
dreadful
of
all
violence
that
of
the
ignorant
crowd
he
saw
that
thanks
to
this
equality
now
preached
everything
may
pass
into
violence
and
violence
into
arbitrary
acts
and
thence
into
unchecked
passion
which
will
rend
the
world
as
the
wolf
does
its
prey
and
in
the
end
the
world
will
swallow
itself
up
even
if
this
does
not
happen
with
mankind
when
it
attains
equality
if
the
love
of
nations
and
eternal
peace
prove
not
to
be
that
impossible
nothing
as
alonso
expressed
it
in
the
tempest
but
if
on
the
contrary
the
actual
attainment
of
aspirations
toward
equality
is
possible
then
the
poet
would
deem
that
the
old
age
and
extinction
of
the
world
had
approached
and
that
therefore
for
active
individuals
it
is
not
worth
while
to
live
pp
such
is
shakespeare
view
of
life
as
demonstrated
by
his
greatest
exponent
and
admirer
another
of
the
most
modern
admirers
of
shakespeare
george
brandes
further
sets
forth
no
one
of
course
can
conserve
his
life
quite
pure
from
evil
from
deceit
and
from
the
injury
of
others
but
evil
and
deceit
are
not
always
vices
and
even
the
evil
caused
to
others
is
not
necessarily
a
vice
it
is
often
merely
a
necessity
a
legitimate
weapon
a
right
and
indeed
shakespeare
always
held
that
there
are
no
unconditional
prohibitions
nor
unconditional
duties
for
instance
he
did
not
doubt
hamlet
right
to
kill
the
king
nor
even
his
right
to
stab
polonius
to
death
and
yet
he
could
not
restrain
himself
from
an
overwhelming
feeling
of
indignation
and
repulsion
when
looking
around
he
saw
everywhere
how
incessantly
the
most
elementary
moral
laws
were
being
infringed
now
in
his
mind
there
was
formed
as
it
were
a
closely
riveted
ring
of
thoughts
concerning
which
he
had
always
vaguely
felt
such
unconditional
commandments
do
not
exist
the
quality
and
significance
of
an
act
not
to
speak
of
a
character
do
not
depend
upon
their
enactment
or
infringement
the
whole
substance
lies
in
the
contents
with
which
the
separate
individual
at
the
moment
of
his
decision
and
on
his
own
responsibility
fills
up
the
form
of
these
laws
in
other
words
shakespeare
at
last
clearly
saw
that
the
moral
of
the
is
the
only
true
and
possible
one
so
that
according
to
brandes
shakespeare
fundamental
principle
for
which
he
extols
him
is
that
end
justifies
the
action
at
all
costs
the
absence
of
all
ideals
moderation
in
everything
the
conservation
of
the
forms
of
life
once
established
and
the
end
justifying
the
means
if
you
add
to
this
a
chauvinist
english
patriotism
expressed
in
all
the
historical
dramas
a
patriotism
according
to
which
the
english
throne
is
something
sacred
englishmen
always
vanquishing
the
french
killing
thousands
and
losing
only
scores
joan
of
arc
regarded
as
a
witch
and
the
belief
that
hector
and
all
the
trojans
from
whom
the
english
came
are
heroes
while
the
greeks
are
cowards
and
traitors
and
so
forth
such
is
the
view
of
life
of
the
wisest
teacher
of
life
according
to
his
greatest
admirers
and
he
who
will
attentively
read
shakespeare
works
can
not
fail
to
recognize
that
the
description
of
this
shakespearian
view
of
life
by
his
admirers
is
quite
correct
the
merit
of
every
poetic
work
depends
on
three
things
the
subject
of
the
work
the
deeper
the
subject
the
more
important
it
is
to
the
life
of
mankind
the
higher
is
the
work
the
external
beauty
achieved
by
technical
methods
proper
to
the
particular
kind
of
art
thus
in
dramatic
art
the
technical
method
will
be
a
true
individuality
of
language
corresponding
to
the
characters
a
natural
and
at
the
same
time
touching
plot
a
correct
scenic
rendering
of
the
demonstration
and
development
of
emotion
and
the
feeling
of
measure
in
all
that
is
represented
sincerity
that
the
author
should
himself
keenly
feel
what
he
expresses
without
this
condition
there
can
be
no
work
of
art
as
the
essence
of
art
consists
in
the
contemplation
of
the
work
of
art
being
infected
with
the
author
feeling
if
the
author
does
not
actually
feel
what
he
expresses
then
the
recipient
can
not
become
infected
with
the
feeling
of
the
author
does
not
experience
any
feeling
and
the
production
can
no
longer
be
classified
as
a
work
of
art
the
subject
of
shakespeare
pieces
as
is
seen
from
the
demonstrations
of
his
greatest
admirers
is
the
lowest
most
vulgar
view
of
life
which
regards
the
external
elevation
of
the
lords
of
the
world
as
a
genuine
distinction
despises
the
crowd
the
working
classes
repudiates
not
only
all
religious
but
also
all
humanitarian
strivings
directed
to
the
betterment
of
the
existing
order
the
second
condition
also
with
the
exception
of
the
rendering
of
the
scenes
in
which
the
movement
of
feelings
is
expressed
is
quite
absent
in
shakespeare
he
does
not
grasp
the
natural
character
of
the
positions
of
his
personages
nor
the
language
of
the
persons
represented
nor
the
feeling
of
measure
without
which
no
work
can
be
artistic
the
third
and
most
important
condition
sincerity
is
completely
absent
in
all
shakespeare
works
in
all
of
them
one
sees
intentional
artifice
one
sees
that
he
is
not
but
that
he
is
playing
with
words
vii
shakespeare
works
do
not
satisfy
the
demands
of
all
art
and
besides
this
their
tendency
is
of
the
lowest
and
most
immoral
what
then
signifies
the
great
fame
these
works
have
enjoyed
for
more
than
a
hundred
years
many
times
during
my
life
i
have
had
occasion
to
argue
about
shakespeare
with
his
admirers
not
only
with
people
little
sensitive
to
poetry
but
with
those
who
keenly
felt
poetic
beauty
such
as
turgenef
fet
and
others
and
every
time
i
encountered
one
and
the
same
attitude
toward
my
objection
to
the
praises
of
shakespeare
i
was
not
refuted
when
i
pointed
out
shakespeare
defects
they
only
condoled
with
me
for
my
want
of
comprehension
and
urged
upon
me
the
necessity
of
recognizing
the
extraordinary
supernatural
grandeur
of
shakespeare
and
they
did
not
explain
to
me
in
what
the
beauties
of
shakespeare
consisted
but
were
merely
vaguely
and
exaggeratedly
enraptured
with
the
whole
of
shakespeare
extolling
some
favorite
passages
the
unbuttoning
of
button
falstaff
lying
lady
macbeth
ineffaceable
spots
exhortation
to
his
father
ghost
forty
thousand
brothers
etc
open
shakespeare
i
used
to
say
to
these
admirers
wherever
you
like
or
wherever
it
may
chance
you
will
see
that
you
will
never
find
ten
consecutive
lines
which
are
comprehensible
unartificial
natural
to
the
character
that
says
them
and
which
produce
an
artistic
impression
this
experiment
may
be
made
by
any
one
and
either
at
random
or
according
to
their
own
choice
shakespeare
admirers
opened
pages
in
shakespeare
dramas
and
without
paying
any
attention
to
my
criticisms
as
to
why
the
selected
ten
lines
did
not
satisfy
the
most
elementary
demands
of
esthetic
and
common
sense
they
were
enchanted
with
the
very
thing
which
to
me
appeared
absurd
incomprehensible
and
inartistic
so
that
in
general
when
i
endeavored
to
get
from
shakespeare
worshipers
an
explanation
of
his
greatness
i
met
in
them
exactly
the
same
attitude
which
i
have
met
and
which
is
usually
met
in
the
defenders
of
any
dogmas
accepted
not
through
reason
but
through
faith
it
is
this
attitude
of
shakespeare
admirers
toward
their
object
an
attitude
which
may
be
seen
also
in
all
the
mistily
indefinite
essays
and
conversations
about
shakespeare
which
gave
me
the
key
to
the
understanding
of
the
cause
of
shakespeare
fame
there
is
but
one
explanation
of
this
wonderful
fame
it
is
one
of
those
epidemic
suggestions
to
which
men
constantly
have
been
and
are
subject
such
suggestion
always
has
existed
and
does
exist
in
the
most
varied
spheres
of
life
as
glaring
instances
considerable
in
scope
and
in
deceitful
influence
one
may
cite
the
medieval
crusades
which
afflicted
not
only
adults
but
even
children
and
the
individual
suggestions
startling
in
their
senselessness
such
as
faith
in
witches
in
the
utility
of
torture
for
the
discovery
of
the
truth
the
search
for
the
elixir
of
life
the
philosopher
stone
or
the
passion
for
tulips
valued
at
several
thousand
guldens
a
bulb
which
took
hold
of
holland
such
irrational
suggestions
always
have
been
existing
and
still
exist
in
all
spheres
of
human
life
religious
philosophical
political
economical
scientific
artistic
and
in
general
literary
and
people
clearly
see
the
insanity
of
these
suggestions
only
when
they
free
themselves
from
them
but
as
long
as
they
are
under
their
influence
the
suggestions
appear
to
them
so
certain
so
true
that
to
argue
about
them
is
regarded
as
neither
necessary
nor
possible
with
the
development
of
the
printing
press
these
epidemics
became
especially
striking
with
the
development
of
the
press
it
has
now
come
to
pass
that
so
soon
as
any
event
owing
to
casual
circumstances
receives
an
especially
prominent
significance
immediately
the
organs
of
the
press
announce
this
significance
as
soon
as
the
press
has
brought
forward
the
significance
of
the
event
the
public
devotes
more
and
more
attention
to
it
the
attention
of
the
public
prompts
the
press
to
examine
the
event
with
greater
attention
and
in
greater
detail
the
interest
of
the
public
further
increases
and
the
organs
of
the
press
competing
with
one
another
satisfy
the
public
demand
the
public
is
still
more
interested
the
press
attributes
yet
more
significance
to
the
event
so
that
the
importance
of
the
event
continually
growing
like
a
lump
of
snow
receives
an
appreciation
utterly
inappropriate
to
its
real
significance
and
this
appreciation
often
exaggerated
to
insanity
is
retained
so
long
as
the
conception
of
life
of
the
leaders
of
the
press
and
of
the
public
remains
the
same
there
are
innumerable
examples
of
such
an
inappropriate
estimation
which
in
our
time
owing
to
the
mutual
influence
of
press
and
public
on
one
another
is
attached
to
the
most
insignificant
subjects
a
striking
example
of
such
mutual
influence
of
the
public
and
the
press
was
the
excitement
in
the
case
of
dreyfus
which
lately
caught
hold
of
the
whole
world
the
suspicion
arose
that
some
captain
of
the
french
staff
was
guilty
of
treason
whether
because
this
particular
captain
was
a
jew
or
because
of
some
special
internal
party
disagreements
in
french
society
the
press
attached
a
somewhat
prominent
interest
to
this
event
whose
like
is
continually
occurring
without
attracting
any
one
attention
and
without
being
able
to
interest
even
the
french
military
still
less
the
whole
world
the
public
turned
its
attention
to
this
incident
the
organs
of
the
press
mutually
competing
began
to
describe
examine
discuss
the
event
the
public
was
yet
more
interested
the
press
answered
to
the
demand
of
the
public
and
the
lump
of
snow
began
to
grow
and
grow
till
before
our
eyes
it
attained
such
a
bulk
that
there
was
not
a
family
where
controversies
did
not
rage
about
the
caricature
by
caran
representing
at
first
a
peaceful
family
resolved
to
talk
no
more
about
dreyfus
and
then
like
exasperated
furies
members
of
the
same
family
fighting
with
each
other
quite
correctly
expressed
the
attitude
of
the
whole
of
the
reading
world
to
the
question
about
dreyfus
people
of
foreign
nationalities
who
could
not
be
interested
in
the
question
whether
a
french
officer
was
a
traitor
or
not
people
moreover
who
could
know
nothing
of
the
development
of
the
case
all
divided
themselves
for
and
against
dreyfus
and
the
moment
they
met
they
talked
and
argued
about
dreyfus
some
asserting
his
guilt
with
assurance
others
denying
it
with
equal
assurance
only
after
the
lapse
of
some
years
did
people
begin
to
awake
from
the
suggestion
and
to
understand
that
they
could
not
possibly
know
whether
dreyfus
was
guilty
or
not
and
that
each
one
had
thousands
of
subjects
much
more
near
to
him
and
interesting
than
the
case
of
dreyfus
such
infatuations
take
place
in
all
spheres
but
they
are
especially
noticeable
in
the
sphere
of
literature
as
the
press
naturally
occupies
itself
the
more
keenly
with
the
affairs
of
the
press
and
they
are
particularly
powerful
in
our
time
when
the
press
has
received
such
an
unnatural
development
it
continually
happens
that
people
suddenly
begin
to
extol
some
most
insignificant
works
in
exaggerated
language
and
then
if
these
works
do
not
correspond
to
the
prevailing
view
of
life
they
suddenly
become
utterly
indifferent
to
them
and
forget
both
the
works
themselves
and
their
former
attitude
toward
them
so
within
my
recollection
in
the
forties
there
was
in
the
sphere
of
art
the
laudation
and
glorification
of
eugène
sue
and
georges
sand
and
in
the
social
sphere
fourier
in
the
philosophical
sphere
comte
and
hegel
in
the
scientific
sphere
darwin
sue
is
quite
forgotten
georges
sand
is
being
forgotten
and
replaced
by
the
writings
of
zola
and
the
decadents
beaudelaire
verlaine
maeterlinck
and
others
fourier
with
his
phalansteries
is
quite
forgotten
his
place
being
taken
by
marx
hegel
who
justified
the
existing
order
and
comte
who
denied
the
necessity
of
religious
activity
in
mankind
and
darwin
with
his
law
of
struggle
still
hold
on
but
are
beginning
to
be
forgotten
being
replaced
by
the
teaching
of
nietzsche
which
altho
utterly
extravagant
unconsidered
misty
and
vicious
in
its
bearing
yet
corresponds
better
with
existing
tendencies
thus
sometimes
artistic
philosophic
and
in
general
literary
crazes
suddenly
arise
and
are
as
quickly
forgotten
but
it
also
happens
that
such
crazes
having
arisen
in
consequence
of
special
reasons
accidentally
favoring
to
their
establishment
correspond
in
such
a
degree
to
the
views
of
life
spread
in
society
and
especially
in
literary
circles
that
they
are
maintained
for
a
long
time
as
far
back
as
in
the
time
of
rome
it
was
remarked
that
often
books
have
their
own
very
strange
fates
consisting
in
failure
notwithstanding
their
high
merits
and
in
enormous
undeserved
success
notwithstanding
their
triviality
the
saying
arose
pro
captu
lectoris
habent
sua
fata
libelli
that
the
fate
of
books
depends
on
the
understanding
of
those
who
read
them
there
was
harmony
between
shakespeare
writings
and
the
view
of
life
of
those
amongst
whom
his
fame
arose
and
this
fame
has
been
and
still
is
maintained
owing
to
shakespeare
works
continuing
to
correspond
to
the
life
concept
of
those
who
support
this
fame
until
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
shakespeare
not
only
failed
to
gain
any
special
fame
in
england
but
was
valued
less
than
his
contemporary
dramatists
ben
jonson
fletcher
beaumont
and
others
his
fame
originated
in
germany
and
thence
was
transferred
to
england
this
happened
for
the
following
reason
art
especially
dramatic
art
demanding
for
its
realization
great
preparations
outlays
and
labor
was
always
religious
its
object
was
to
stimulate
in
men
a
clearer
conception
of
that
relation
of
man
to
god
which
had
at
that
time
been
attained
by
the
leading
men
of
the
circles
interested
in
art
so
it
was
bound
to
be
from
its
own
nature
and
so
as
a
matter
of
fact
has
it
always
been
among
all
nations
egyptians
hindus
chinese
greeks
commencing
in
some
remote
period
of
human
life
and
it
has
always
happened
that
with
the
coarsening
of
religious
forms
art
has
more
and
more
diverged
from
its
original
object
according
to
which
it
could
be
regarded
as
an
important
function
almost
an
act
of
worship
and
instead
of
serving
religious
objects
it
strove
for
worldly
aims
seeking
to
satisfy
the
demands
of
the
crowd
or
of
the
powerful
the
aims
of
recreation
and
amusement
this
deviation
of
art
from
its
true
and
high
vocation
took
place
everywhere
and
even
in
connection
with
christianity
the
first
manifestations
of
christian
art
were
services
in
churches
in
the
administration
of
the
sacraments
and
the
ordinary
liturgy
when
in
course
of
time
the
forms
of
art
as
used
in
worship
became
insufficient
there
appeared
the
mysteries
describing
those
events
which
were
regarded
as
the
most
important
in
the
christian
religious
view
of
life
when
in
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
centuries
the
center
of
gravity
of
christian
teaching
was
more
and
more
transferred
the
worship
of
christ
as
god
and
the
interpretation
and
following
of
his
teaching
the
form
of
mysteries
describing
external
christian
events
became
insufficient
and
new
forms
were
demanded
as
the
expression
of
the
aspirations
which
gave
rise
to
these
changes
there
appeared
the
moralities
dramatic
representations
in
which
the
characters
were
personifications
of
christian
virtues
and
their
opposite
vices
but
allegories
owing
to
the
very
fact
of
their
being
works
of
art
of
a
lower
order
could
not
replace
the
former
religious
dramas
and
yet
no
new
forms
of
dramatic
art
corresponding
to
the
conception
now
entertained
of
christianity
according
to
which
it
was
regarded
as
a
teaching
of
life
had
yet
been
found
hence
dramatic
art
having
no
foundation
came
in
all
christian
countries
to
swerve
farther
and
farther
from
its
proper
use
and
object
and
instead
of
serving
god
it
took
to
serving
the
crowd
by
crowd
i
mean
not
simply
the
masses
of
common
people
but
the
majority
of
immoral
or
unmoral
men
indifferent
to
the
higher
problems
of
human
life
this
deviation
was
moreover
encouraged
by
the
circumstance
that
at
this
very
time
the
greek
thinkers
poets
and
dramatists
hitherto
unknown
in
the
christian
world
were
discovered
and
brought
back
into
favor
from
all
this
it
followed
that
not
having
yet
had
time
to
work
out
their
own
form
of
dramatic
art
corresponding
to
the
new
conception
entertained
of
christianity
as
being
a
teaching
of
life
and
at
the
same
time
recognizing
the
previous
form
of
mysteries
and
moralities
as
insufficient
the
writers
of
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
centuries
in
their
search
for
a
new
form
began
to
imitate
the
newly
discovered
greek
models
attracted
by
their
elegance
and
novelty
since
those
who
could
principally
avail
themselves
of
dramatic
representations
were
the
powerful
of
this
world
kings
princes
courtiers
the
least
religious
people
not
only
utterly
indifferent
to
the
questions
of
religion
but
in
most
cases
completely
depraved
therefore
in
satisfying
the
demands
of
its
audience
the
drama
of
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
entirely
gave
up
all
religious
aim
it
came
to
pass
that
the
drama
which
formerly
had
such
a
lofty
and
religious
significance
and
which
can
on
this
condition
alone
occupy
an
important
place
in
human
life
became
as
in
the
time
of
rome
a
spectacle
an
amusement
a
recreation
with
this
difference
that
in
rome
the
spectacles
existed
for
the
whole
people
whereas
in
the
christian
world
of
the
fifteenth
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
they
were
principally
meant
for
depraved
kings
and
the
higher
classes
such
was
the
case
with
the
spanish
english
italian
and
french
drama
the
dramas
of
that
time
principally
composed
in
all
these
countries
according
to
ancient
greek
models
or
taken
from
poems
legends
or
biographies
naturally
reflected
the
characteristics
of
their
respective
nationalities
in
italy
comedies
were
chiefly
elaborated
with
humorous
positions
and
persons
in
spain
there
flourished
the
worldly
drama
with
complicated
plots
and
historical
heroes
the
peculiarities
of
the
english
drama
were
the
coarse
incidents
of
murders
executions
and
battles
taking
place
on
the
stage
and
popular
humorous
interludes
neither
the
italian
nor
the
spanish
nor
the
english
drama
had
european
fame
but
they
all
enjoyed
success
in
their
own
countries
general
fame
owing
to
the
elegance
of
its
language
and
the
talent
of
its
writers
was
possessed
only
by
the
french
drama
distinguished
by
its
strict
adherence
to
the
greek
models
and
especially
to
the
law
of
the
three
unities
so
it
continued
till
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
at
which
time
this
happened
in
germany
which
had
not
produced
even
passable
dramatic
writers
there
was
a
weak
and
little
known
writer
hans
sachs
all
educated
people
together
with
frederick
the
great
bowed
down
before
the
french
drama
yet
at
this
very
time
there
appeared
in
germany
a
group
of
educated
and
talented
writers
and
poets
who
feeling
the
falsity
and
coldness
of
the
french
drama
endeavored
to
find
a
new
and
freer
dramatic
form
the
members
of
this
group
like
all
the
upper
classes
of
the
christian
world
at
that
time
were
under
the
charm
and
influence
of
the
greek
classics
and
being
utterly
indifferent
to
religious
questions
they
thought
that
if
the
greek
drama
describing
the
calamities
and
sufferings
and
strife
of
its
heroes
represented
the
highest
dramatic
ideal
then
such
a
description
of
the
sufferings
and
the
struggles
of
heroes
would
be
a
sufficient
subject
in
the
christian
world
too
if
only
the
narrow
demands
of
were
rejected
these
men
not
understanding
that
for
the
greeks
the
strife
and
sufferings
of
their
heroes
had
a
religious
significance
imagined
that
they
needed
only
to
reject
the
inconvenient
law
of
the
three
unities
without
introducing
into
the
drama
any
religious
element
corresponding
to
their
time
in
order
that
the
drama
should
have
sufficient
scope
in
the
representation
of
various
moments
in
the
lives
of
historical
personages
and
in
general
of
strong
human
passions
exactly
this
kind
of
drama
existed
at
that
time
among
the
kindred
english
people
and
becoming
acquainted
with
it
the
germans
decided
that
precisely
such
should
be
the
drama
of
the
new
period
thereupon
because
of
the
clever
development
of
scenes
which
constituted
shakespeare
peculiarity
they
chose
shakespeare
dramas
in
preference
to
all
other
english
dramas
excluding
those
which
were
not
in
the
least
inferior
but
were
even
superior
to
shakespeare
at
the
head
of
the
group
stood
goethe
who
was
then
the
dictator
of
public
opinion
in
esthetic
questions
he
it
was
who
partly
owing
to
a
desire
to
destroy
the
fascination
of
the
false
french
art
partly
owing
to
his
desire
to
give
a
greater
scope
to
his
own
dramatic
writing
but
chiefly
through
the
agreement
of
his
view
of
life
with
shakespeare
declared
shakespeare
a
great
poet
when
this
error
was
announced
by
an
authority
like
goethe
all
those
esthetic
critics
who
did
not
understand
art
threw
themselves
on
it
like
crows
on
carrion
and
began
to
discover
in
shakespeare
beauties
which
did
not
exist
and
to
extol
them
these
men
german
esthetic
critics
for
the
most
part
utterly
devoid
of
esthetic
feeling
without
that
simple
direct
artistic
sensibility
which
for
people
with
a
feeling
for
art
clearly
distinguishes
esthetic
impressions
from
all
others
but
believing
the
authority
which
had
recognized
shakespeare
as
a
great
poet
began
to
praise
the
whole
of
shakespeare
indiscriminately
especially
distinguishing
such
passages
as
struck
them
by
their
effects
or
which
expressed
thoughts
corresponding
to
their
views
of
life
imagining
that
these
effects
and
these
thoughts
constitute
the
essence
of
what
is
called
art
these
men
acted
as
blind
men
would
act
who
endeavored
to
find
diamonds
by
touch
among
a
heap
of
stones
they
were
fingering
as
the
blind
man
would
for
a
long
time
strenuously
handle
the
stones
and
in
the
end
would
come
to
no
other
conclusion
than
that
all
stones
are
precious
and
especially
so
the
smoothest
so
also
these
esthetic
critics
without
artistic
feeling
could
not
but
come
to
similar
results
in
relation
to
shakespeare
to
give
the
greater
force
to
their
praise
of
the
whole
of
shakespeare
they
invented
esthetic
theories
according
to
which
it
appeared
that
no
definite
religious
view
of
life
was
necessary
for
works
of
art
in
general
and
especially
for
the
drama
that
for
the
purpose
of
the
drama
the
representation
of
human
passions
and
characters
was
quite
sufficient
that
not
only
was
an
internal
religious
illumination
of
what
was
represented
unnecessary
but
art
should
be
objective
should
represent
events
quite
independently
of
any
judgment
of
good
and
evil
as
these
theories
were
founded
on
shakespeare
own
views
of
life
it
naturally
turned
out
that
the
works
of
shakespeare
satisfied
these
theories
and
therefore
were
the
height
of
perfection
it
is
these
people
who
are
chiefly
responsible
for
shakespeare
fame
it
was
principally
owing
to
their
writings
that
the
interaction
took
place
between
writers
and
public
which
expressed
itself
and
is
still
expressing
itself
in
an
insane
worship
of
shakespeare
which
has
no
rational
foundation
these
esthetic
critics
have
written
profound
treatises
about
shakespeare
eleven
thousand
volumes
have
been
written
about
him
and
a
whole
science
of
shakespearology
composed
while
the
public
on
the
one
hand
took
more
and
more
interest
and
the
learned
critics
on
the
other
hand
gave
further
and
further
explanations
adding
to
the
confusion
so
that
the
first
cause
of
shakespeare
fame
was
that
the
germans
wished
to
oppose
to
the
cold
french
drama
of
which
they
had
grown
weary
and
which
no
doubt
was
tedious
enough
a
livelier
and
freer
one
the
second
cause
was
that
the
young
german
writers
required
a
model
for
writing
their
own
dramas
the
third
and
principal
cause
was
the
activity
of
the
learned
and
zealous
esthetic
german
critics
without
esthetic
feeling
who
invented
the
theory
of
objective
art
deliberately
rejecting
the
religious
essence
of
the
drama
but
i
shall
be
asked
what
do
you
understand
by
the
word
religious
essence
of
the
drama
may
not
what
you
are
demanding
for
the
drama
religious
instruction
or
didactics
be
called
a
thing
incompatible
with
true
art
i
reply
that
by
the
religious
essence
of
art
i
understand
not
the
direct
inculcation
of
any
religious
truths
in
an
artistic
guise
and
not
an
allegorical
demonstration
of
these
truths
but
the
exhibition
of
a
definite
view
of
life
corresponding
to
the
highest
religious
understanding
of
a
given
time
which
serving
as
the
motive
for
the
composition
of
the
drama
penetrates
to
the
knowledge
of
the
author
through
all
of
his
work
so
it
has
always
been
with
true
art
and
so
it
is
with
every
true
artist
in
general
and
especially
the
dramatist
hence
as
it
was
when
the
drama
was
a
serious
thing
and
as
it
should
be
according
to
the
essence
of
the
matter
that
man
alone
can
write
a
drama
who
has
something
to
say
to
men
and
something
which
is
of
the
greatest
importance
for
them
about
man
relation
to
god
to
the
universe
to
the
all
the
eternal
the
infinite
but
when
thanks
to
the
german
theories
about
objective
art
the
idea
was
established
that
for
the
drama
this
was
quite
unnecessary
then
it
is
obvious
how
a
writer
like
shakespeare
who
had
not
got
developed
in
his
mind
the
religious
convictions
proper
to
his
time
who
in
fact
had
no
convictions
at
all
but
heaped
up
in
his
drama
all
possible
events
horrors
fooleries
discussions
and
effects
could
appear
to
be
a
dramatic
writer
of
the
greatest
genius
but
these
are
all
external
reasons
the
fundamental
inner
cause
of
shakespeare
fame
was
and
is
this
that
his
dramas
were
pro
captu
lectoris
they
corresponded
to
the
irreligious
and
immoral
frame
of
mind
of
the
upper
classes
of
his
time
viii
at
the
beginning
of
the
last
century
when
goethe
was
dictator
of
philosophic
thought
and
esthetic
laws
a
series
of
casual
circumstances
made
him
praise
shakespeare
the
esthetic
critics
caught
up
this
praise
and
took
to
writing
their
lengthy
misty
learned
articles
and
the
great
european
public
began
to
be
enchanted
with
shakespeare
the
critics
answering
to
the
popular
interest
and
endeavoring
to
compete
with
one
another
wrote
new
and
ever
new
essays
about
shakespeare
the
readers
and
spectators
on
their
side
were
increasingly
confirmed
in
their
admiration
and
shakespeare
fame
like
a
lump
of
snow
kept
growing
and
growing
until
in
our
time
it
has
attained
that
insane
worship
which
obviously
has
no
other
foundation
than
suggestion
shakespeare
finds
no
rival
not
even
approximately
either
among
the
old
or
the
new
writers
here
are
some
of
the
tributes
paid
to
him
poetic
truth
is
the
brightest
flower
in
the
crown
of
merits
shakespeare
is
the
greatest
moralist
of
all
times
shakespeare
exhibits
such
and
such
objectivism
that
they
carry
him
beyond
the
limits
of
time
and
nationality
shakespeare
is
the
greatest
genius
that
has
hitherto
existed
for
the
creation
of
tragedy
comedy
history
idyll
idyllistic
comedy
esthetic
idyll
for
the
profoundest
presentation
or
for
any
casually
thrown
off
passing
piece
of
verse
he
is
the
only
man
he
not
only
wields
an
unlimited
power
over
our
mirth
and
our
tears
over
all
the
workings
of
passion
humor
thought
and
observation
but
he
possesses
also
an
infinite
region
full
of
the
phantasy
of
fiction
of
a
horrifying
and
an
amusing
character
he
possesses
penetration
both
in
the
world
of
fiction
and
of
reality
and
above
this
reigns
one
and
the
same
truthfulness
to
character
and
to
nature
and
the
same
spirit
of
humanity
to
shakespeare
the
epithet
of
great
comes
of
itself
and
if
one
adds
that
independently
of
his
greatness
he
has
further
become
the
reformer
of
all
literature
and
moreover
has
in
his
works
not
only
expressed
the
phenomenon
of
life
as
it
was
in
his
day
but
also
by
the
genius
of
thought
which
floated
in
the
air
has
prophetically
forestalled
the
direction
that
the
social
spirit
was
going
to
take
in
the
future
of
which
we
see
a
striking
example
in
hamlet
one
may
without
hesitation
say
that
shakespeare
was
not
only
a
great
poet
but
the
greatest
of
all
poets
who
ever
existed
and
that
in
the
sphere
of
poetic
creation
his
only
worthy
rival
was
that
same
life
which
in
his
works
he
expressed
to
such
perfection
the
obvious
exaggeration
of
this
estimate
proves
more
conclusively
than
anything
that
it
is
the
consequence
not
of
common
sense
but
of
suggestion
the
more
trivial
the
lower
the
emptier
a
phenomenon
is
if
only
it
has
become
the
subject
of
suggestion
the
more
supernatural
and
exaggerated
is
the
significance
attributed
to
it
the
pope
is
not
merely
saintly
but
most
saintly
and
so
forth
so
shakespeare
is
not
merely
a
good
writer
but
the
greatest
genius
the
eternal
teacher
of
man
kind
suggestion
is
always
a
deceit
and
every
deceit
is
an
evil
in
truth
the
suggestion
that
shakespeare
works
are
great
works
of
genius
presenting
the
height
of
both
esthetic
and
ethical
perfection
has
caused
and
is
causing
great
injury
to
men
this
injury
is
twofold
first
the
fall
of
the
drama
and
the
replacement
of
this
important
weapon
of
progress
by
an
empty
and
immoral
amusement
and
secondly
the
direct
depravation
of
men
by
presenting
to
them
false
models
for
imitation
human
life
is
perfected
only
through
the
development
of
the
religious
consciousness
the
only
element
which
permanently
unites
men
the
development
of
the
religious
consciousness
of
men
is
accomplished
through
all
the
sides
of
man
spiritual
activity
one
direction
of
this
activity
is
in
art
one
section
of
art
perhaps
the
most
influential
is
the
drama
therefore
the
drama
in
order
to
deserve
the
importance
attributed
to
it
should
serve
the
development
of
religious
consciousness
such
has
the
drama
always
been
and
such
it
was
in
the
christian
world
but
upon
the
appearance
of
protestantism
in
its
broader
sense
the
appearance
of
a
new
understanding
of
christianity
as
of
a
teaching
of
life
the
dramatic
art
did
not
find
a
form
corresponding
to
the
new
understanding
of
christianity
and
the
men
of
the
renaissance
were
carried
away
by
the
imitation
of
classical
art
this
was
most
natural
but
the
tendency
was
bound
to
pass
and
art
had
to
discover
as
indeed
it
is
now
beginning
to
do
its
new
form
corresponding
to
the
change
in
the
understanding
of
christianity
but
the
discovery
of
this
new
form
was
arrested
by
the
teaching
arising
among
german
writers
at
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
and
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
centuries
as
to
objective
art
art
indifferent
to
good
or
evil
and
therein
the
exaggerated
praise
of
shakespeare
dramas
which
partly
corresponded
to
the
esthetic
teaching
of
the
germans
and
partly
served
as
material
for
it
if
there
had
not
been
exaggerated
praise
of
shakespeare
dramas
presenting
them
as
the
most
perfect
models
the
men
of
the
eighteenth
and
nineteenth
centuries
would
have
had
to
understand
that
the
drama
to
have
a
right
to
exist
and
to
be
a
serious
thing
must
serve
as
it
always
has
served
and
can
not
but
do
otherwise
the
development
of
the
religious
consciousness
and
having
understood
this
they
would
have
searched
for
a
new
form
of
drama
corresponding
to
their
religious
understanding
but
when
it
was
decided
that
the
height
of
perfection
was
drama
and
that
we
ought
to
write
as
he
did
not
only
without
any
religious
but
even
without
any
moral
significance
then
all
writers
of
dramas
in
imitation
of
him
began
to
compose
such
empty
pieces
as
are
those
of
goethe
schiller
hugo
and
in
russia
of
pushkin
or
the
chronicles
of
ostrovski
alexis
tolstoy
and
an
innumerable
number
of
other
more
or
less
celebrated
dramatic
productions
which
fill
all
the
theaters
and
can
be
prepared
wholesale
by
any
one
who
happens
to
have
the
idea
or
desire
to
write
a
play
it
is
only
thanks
to
such
a
low
trivial
understanding
of
the
significance
of
the
drama
that
there
appears
among
us
that
infinite
quantity
of
dramatic
works
describing
men
actions
positions
characters
and
frames
of
mind
not
only
void
of
any
spiritual
substance
but
often
of
any
human
sense
let
not
the
reader
think
that
i
exclude
from
this
estimate
of
contemporary
drama
the
theatrical
pieces
i
have
myself
incidentally
written
i
recognize
them
as
well
as
all
the
rest
as
not
having
that
religious
character
which
must
form
the
foundation
of
the
drama
of
the
future
the
drama
then
the
most
important
branch
of
art
has
in
our
time
become
the
trivial
and
immoral
amusement
of
a
trivial
and
immoral
crowd
the
worst
of
it
is
moreover
that
to
dramatic
art
fallen
as
low
as
it
is
possible
to
fall
is
still
attributed
an
elevated
significance
no
longer
appropriate
to
it
dramatists
actors
theatrical
managers
and
the
press
this
last
publishing
in
the
most
serious
tone
reports
of
theaters
and
operas
and
the
rest
are
all
perfectly
certain
that
they
are
doing
something
very
worthy
and
important
the
drama
in
our
time
is
a
great
man
fallen
who
has
reached
the
last
degree
of
his
degradation
and
at
the
same
time
continues
to
pride
himself
on
his
past
of
which
nothing
now
remains
the
public
of
our
time
is
like
those
who
mercilessly
amuse
themselves
over
this
man
once
so
great
and
now
in
the
lowest
stage
of
his
fall
such
is
one
of
the
mischievous
effects
of
the
epidemic
suggestion
about
the
greatness
of
shakespeare
another
deplorable
result
of
this
worship
is
the
presentation
to
men
of
a
false
model
for
imitation
if
people
wrote
of
shakespeare
that
for
his
time
he
was
a
good
writer
that
he
had
a
fairly
good
turn
for
verse
was
an
intelligent
actor
and
good
stage
manager
even
were
this
appreciation
incorrect
and
somewhat
exaggerated
if
only
it
were
moderately
true
people
of
the
rising
generation
might
remain
free
from
shakespeare
influence
but
when
every
young
man
entering
into
life
in
our
time
has
presented
to
him
as
the
model
of
moral
perfection
not
the
religious
and
moral
teachers
of
mankind
but
first
of
all
shakespeare
concerning
whom
it
has
been
decided
and
is
handed
down
by
learned
men
from
generation
to
generation
as
an
incontestable
truth
that
he
was
the
greatest
poet
the
greatest
teacher
of
life
the
young
man
can
not
remain
free
from
this
pernicious
influence
when
he
is
reading
or
listening
to
shakespeare
the
question
for
him
is
no
longer
whether
shakespeare
be
good
or
bad
but
only
in
what
consists
that
extraordinary
beauty
both
esthetic
and
ethical
of
which
he
has
been
assured
by
learned
men
whom
he
respects
and
which
he
himself
neither
sees
nor
feels
and
constraining
himself
and
distorting
his
esthetic
and
ethical
feeling
he
tries
to
conform
to
the
ruling
opinion
he
no
longer
believes
in
himself
but
in
what
is
said
by
the
learned
people
whom
he
respects
i
have
experienced
all
this
then
reading
critical
examinations
of
the
dramas
and
extracts
from
books
with
explanatory
comments
he
begins
to
imagine
that
he
feels
something
of
the
nature
of
an
artistic
impression
the
longer
this
continues
the
more
does
his
esthetical
and
ethical
feeling
become
distorted
he
ceases
to
distinguish
directly
and
clearly
what
is
artistic
from
an
artificial
imitation
of
art
but
above
all
having
assimilated
the
immoral
view
of
life
which
penetrates
all
shakespeare
writings
he
loses
the
capacity
of
distinguishing
good
from
evil
and
the
error
of
extolling
an
insignificant
inartistic
writer
not
only
not
moral
but
directly
immoral
executes
its
destructive
work
this
is
why
i
think
that
the
sooner
people
free
themselves
from
the
false
glorification
of
shakespeare
the
better
it
will
be
first
having
freed
themselves
from
this
deceit
men
will
come
to
understand
that
the
drama
which
has
no
religious
element
at
its
foundation
is
not
only
not
an
important
and
good
thing
as
it
is
now
supposed
to
be
but
the
most
trivial
and
despicable
of
things
having
understood
this
they
will
have
to
search
for
and
work
out
a
new
form
of
modern
drama
a
drama
which
will
serve
as
the
development
and
confirmation
of
the
highest
stage
of
religious
consciousness
in
men
secondly
having
freed
themselves
from
this
hypnotic
state
men
will
understand
that
the
trivial
and
immoral
works
of
shakespeare
and
his
imitators
aiming
merely
at
the
recreation
and
amusement
of
the
spectators
can
not
possibly
represent
the
teaching
of
life
and
that
while
there
is
no
true
religious
drama
the
teaching
of
life
should
be
sought
for
in
other
sources

but
shakespeare
shakespeare
where
is
there
a
line
in
shakespeare
to
entitle
him
to
a
place
in
this
brotherhood
is
there
anything
in
his
plays
that
is
in
the
least
inconsistent
with
all
that
is
reactionary
a
glance
at
shakespeare
lists
of
is
sufficient
to
show
that
he
was
unable
to
conceive
of
any
situation
rising
to
the
dignity
of
tragedy
in
other
than
royal
and
ducal
circles
it
may
be
said
in
explanation
of
this
partiality
for
high
rank
that
he
was
only
following
the
custom
of
the
dramatists
of
his
time
but
this
is
a
poor
plea
for
a
man
of
great
genius
whose
business
it
is
precisely
to
lead
and
not
to
follow
nor
is
the
explanation
altogether
accurate
in
his
play
the
pinner
of
wakefield
first
printed
in
robert
greene
makes
a
hero
and
a
very
stalwart
one
of
a
mere
who
proudly
refuses
knighthood
at
the
hands
of
the
king
there
were
other
and
earlier
plays
in
vogue
in
shakespeare
day
treating
of
the
triumphs
of
men
of
the
people
one
for
instance
which
commemorated
the
rise
of
sir
thomas
gresham
the
merchant
son
and
another
entitled
the
history
of
richard
whittington
of
his
low
birth
his
great
fortune
but
he
carefully
avoided
such
material
in
seeking
plots
for
his
dramas
cardinal
wolsey
the
butcher
son
is
indeed
the
hero
of
henry
but
his
humble
origin
is
only
mentioned
incidentally
as
something
to
be
ashamed
of
what
greater
opportunity
for
idealizing
the
common
people
ever
presented
itself
to
a
dramatist
than
to
shakespeare
when
he
undertook
to
draw
the
character
of
joan
of
arc
in
the
second
part
of
henry
he
knew
how
to
create
noble
women
that
is
one
of
his
special
glories
but
he
not
only
refuses
to
see
anything
noble
in
the
peasant
girl
who
led
france
to
victory
but
he
deliberately
insults
her
memory
with
the
coarsest
and
most
cruel
calumnies
surely
the
lapse
of
more
than
a
century
and
a
half
might
have
enabled
a
man
of
honor
if
not
of
genius
to
do
justice
to
an
enemy
of
the
weaker
sex
and
if
joan
had
been
a
member
of
the
french
royal
family
we
may
be
sure
that
she
would
have
received
better
treatment
the
question
of
the
aristocratic
tendency
of
the
drama
was
an
active
one
in
shakespeare
time
there
was
a
good
deal
of
democratic
feeling
in
the
burghers
of
and
they
resented
the
courtly
prejudices
of
their
playwrights
and
their
habit
of
holding
up
plain
citizens
to
ridicule
upon
the
stage
whenever
they
deigned
to
present
them
at
all
the
prolog
in
beaumont
and
fletcher
knight
of
the
burning
pestle
gives
sufficient
evidence
of
this
the
authors
adopted
the
device
of
having
a
citizen
leap
upon
the
stage
and
interrupt
the
speaker
of
the
prolog
by
shouting
hold
your
peace
goodman
boy
speaker
of
prolog
what
do
you
mean
sir
citizen
that
you
have
no
good
meaning
this
seven
year
there
hath
been
plays
at
this
house
i
have
observed
it
you
have
still
girds
at
citizens
the
citizen
goes
on
to
inform
the
speaker
of
the
prolog
that
he
is
a
grocer
and
to
demand
that
he
present
something
notably
in
honor
of
the
commons
of
the
city
for
a
hero
he
will
have
a
grocer
and
he
shall
do
admirable
things
but
this
proved
to
be
a
joke
over
too
serious
a
matter
for
at
the
first
representation
of
the
play
in
it
was
cried
down
by
the
citizens
and
apprentices
who
did
not
appreciate
its
satire
upon
them
and
it
was
not
revived
for
many
years
thereafter
it
will
not
answer
therefore
to
say
that
the
idea
of
celebrating
the
middle
and
lower
classes
never
occurred
to
shakespeare
for
it
was
a
subject
of
discussion
among
his
contemporaries
it
is
hardly
possible
to
construct
a
play
with
no
characters
but
monarchs
and
their
suites
and
at
the
same
time
preserve
the
verisimilitudes
of
life
shakespeare
was
obliged
to
make
some
use
of
servants
citizens
and
populace
how
has
he
portrayed
them
in
one
play
alone
has
he
given
up
the
whole
stage
to
them
and
it
is
said
that
the
merry
wives
of
windsor
was
only
written
at
the
request
of
queen
elizabeth
who
wished
to
see
sir
john
falstaff
in
love
it
is
from
beginning
to
end
one
prolonged
gird
at
citizens
and
we
can
hardly
wonder
that
they
felt
a
grievance
against
the
dramatic
profession
in
the
other
plays
of
shakespeare
the
humbler
classes
appear
for
the
main
part
only
occasionally
and
incidentally
his
opinion
of
them
is
indicated
more
or
less
picturesquely
by
the
names
which
he
selects
for
them
there
are
for
example
bottom
the
weaver
flute
the
snout
and
sly
tinkers

carpenter

shakespeare
rarely
gives
names
of
this
character
to
any
but
the
lowly
in
life
altho
perhaps
we
should
cite
as
exceptions
sir
toby
belch
and
sir
andrew

the
vicar
sir
oliver

you
like

and
froth
a
foolish
gentleman
in
measure
for
measure
but
none
of
these
personages
quite
deserves
to
rank
as
an
aristocrat
such
a
system
of
nomenclature
as
we
have
exposed
is
enough
of
itself
to
fasten
the
stigma
of
absurdity
upon
the
characters
subjected
to
it
and
their
occupations
most
of
the
trades
are
held
up
for
ridicule
in

made
ridiculous

such
antics

not
amount

but
it
is
not
necessary
to
rehearse

various
familiar

a
laugh
at
their
own
expense
the
language
employed
by
nobility
and
royalty
in
addressing
those
of
inferior
station
in
shakespeare
plays
may
be
taken
perhaps
rather
as
an
indication
of
the
manners
of
the
times
than
as
an
expression
of
his
own
feeling

even
so
it
must
have
been

it
is
hard
to
believe
that
shakespeare

have
so
frequently
allowed
his
characters
to
express
their
contempt
for
members
of
the
lower
orders
of
society
if
he
had
not
had
some
sympathy
with
their
opinions
shakespeare
usually
employs
the
common
people
whom
he
brings
upon
the
stage
merely
to
raise
a
laugh
as
for
instance
the
carriers
in
the
at
rochester

henry

occasionally
they
are
scamps

have
been

anything

reflection

puritan
conscience

shakespeare
came
near
drawing
a
pastoral
sketch
of
shepherds
and
shepherdesses
on
conventional
lines
if
he
failed
to
do
so
it
was
as
much
from
lack
of
respect
for
the
keeping
of
sheep
as
for
the
unrealities
of
pastoral
poetry
rosalind
does
not
scruple
to
call
the
fair

one

high
respect

housewifery
could
have
written

line
when
in
the
same
play
jaques
sees
the
pair
of
rural
lovers
touchstone
and
audrey
approaching
he
cries
there
is
sure
another
flood
and
these
couples
are
coming
to
the
ark
here
come
a
pair
of
very
strange
beasts
which
in
all

called

the
clown
touchstone

of
kissing
the
cow
dugs
which
his
former
sweetheart
had
milked
and
then
marries
audrey
in
a
tempest
of
buffoonery
howbeit
touchstone
remains
one
of
the
few
rustic
characters
of
shakespeare
who
win
our
affections
and
at
the
same
time
he
is
witty
enough
to
deserve
the
title
which
jaques
bestows
upon
him
of
a
rare
fellow
occasionally
shakespeare
makes
fun
of
persons
who
are
somewhat
above
the
lower
classes
in
rank
i
have
mentioned
those
on
whom
he
bestows
comical
names
he
indulges
in
humor

the
expense

scottish
captains

and
shall
we
forget
the
inimitable
falstaff

while
making
every
allowance
for
these
diversions
into
somewhat
nobler
quarters
the
former
of
which
are
explained
by
national
prejudices
do
they
form
serious
exceptions
to
the
rule
and
can
falstaff
be
taken
for
instance
as
a
representative
of
the
real
aristocracy
as
queen
and
courtiers
watched
his
antics
on
the
stage
we
may
be
sure
that
it
never
entered
their
heads
that
the
girds
were
directed
at
them
or
their
kind
the
appearance
on
shakespeare
stage
of
a
man
of
humble
birth
who
is
virtuous
without
being
ridiculous
is
so
rare
an
event
that
it
is
worth
while
to
enumerate
the
instances
now
and
then
a
servant
or
other
obscure
character
is
made
use
of
as
a
mere
lay
figure
of
which
nothing
good
or
evil
can
be
predicated
but
usually
they
are
made
more
or
less
absurd
only
at
long
intervals
do
we
see
persons
of
this
class
at
once
serious
and
upright
as
might
have
been
expected
it
is
more
often
the
servant
than
any
other
member
of
the
lower
classes
to
whom
shakespeare
attributes
good
qualities
for
the
servant
is
a
sort
of
attachment
to
the
gentleman
and
shines
with
the
reflection
of
his
virtues
the
noblest
quality
which
shakespeare
can
conceive
of
in
a
servant
is
loyalty
and
in
richard
ii
act
sc
he
gives
us
a
good
example
in
the
character
of
a
groom
who
remains
faithful
to
the
king
even
when
the
latter
is
cast
into
prison
in
cymbeline
we
are
treated
to
loyalty
the
king
orders
pisanio
a
trusty
servant
to
be
tortured
without
cause
and
his
reply
is
sir
my
life
is
yours
i
humbly
set
it
at
your
will
act
sc
in
king

good

cruelty

his
courage

sword
cries
regan
a
peasant

thus
act
sc
and
other
servants
also
show
sympathy
for
the
unfortunate
earl
we
all
remember
the
fool
who
almost
alone
was
true
to
lear
but
then
of
course
he
was
a
fool
in
timon
of
athens
we
have
an
unusual
array
of
good
servants
but
it
is
doubtful
if
shakespeare
wrote
the
play
and
these
characters
make
his
authorship
more
doubtful

loyal
servitor
master
go
on
and
i
will
follow
thee
to
the
last
gasp
with
truth
and
loyalty
act
sc
but
shakespeare
takes
care
to
point
out
that
such
fidelity
in
servants
is
most
uncommon
and
a
relic
of
the
good
old
times
o
good

fashion

none
will
sweat

for
promotion
outside

ranks

domestic
servants
we
find
a
few
cases
of
honorable
poverty
in
shakespeare

the
play

wily

gives
way

eulogizes

extravagantly

prying

divine
than

give

the
state
to
which

of

monarchical

idea

abhorrent

his
opinion

says

several
places

have
no

tribunes

act
sc
shakespeare
took
his
material
for
the
drama
of
coriolanus
from
plutarch
lives
and
it
is
significant
that
he
selected
from
that
list
of
worthies
the
most
conspicuous
adversary
of
the
commonalty
that
rome
produced
he
presents
him
to
us
as
a
hero
and
so
far
as
he
can
enlists
our
sympathy
for
him
from
beginning
to
end
when
menenius
says
of
him
his
nature
is
too
noble
for
the
world
act
sc
he
is
evidently
but
registering
the
verdict
of
the
author
treatment
of
coriolanus
is
far
different
he
exhibits
his
fine
qualities
but
he
does
not
hesitate
to
speak
of
his
imperious
temper
and
that
savage
manner
which
was
too
haughty
for
a
republic
indeed
he
adds
there
is
no
other
advantage
to
be
had
from
a
liberal
education
equal
to
that
of
polishing
and
softening
our
nature
by
reason
and
discipline
he
also
tells
us
that
coriolanus
indulged
his
irascible
passions
on
a
supposition
that
they
have
something
great
and
exalted
in
them
and
that
he
wanted
a
due
mixture
of
gravity
and
mildness
which
are
the
chief
political
virtues
and
the
fruits
of
reason
and
education
he
never
dreamed
that
such
obstinacy
is
rather
the
effect
of
the
weakness
and
effeminacy
of
a
distempered
mind
which
breaks
out
in
violent
passions
like
so
many
tumors
nor
apparently
did
shakespeare
ever
dream
of
it
either
altho
he
had
plutarch
sage
observations
before
him
it
is
a
pity
that
the
great
dramatist
did
not
select
from
plutarch
works
some
hero
who
took
the
side
of
the
people
some
agis
or
cleomenes
or
better
yet
one
of
the
gracchi
what
a
tragedy
he
might
have
based
on
the
life
of
tiberius
the
friend
of
the
people
and
the
martyr
in
their
cause
but
the
spirit
which
guided
schiller
in
the
choice
of
william
tell
for
a
hero
was
a
stranger
to
shakespeare
heart
and
its
promptings
would
have
met
with
no
response
there
even
more
striking
is
the
treatment
which
the
author
of
coriolanus
metes
out
to
english
history
all
but
two
of
his
english
historical
dramas
are
devoted
to
the
war
of
the
roses
and
the
incidental
struggle
over
the
french
crown
the
motive
of
this
prolonged
strife
so
attractive
to
shakespeare
had
much
the
same
dignity
which
distinguishes
the
family
intrigues
of
the
sublime
porte
and
shakespeare
presents
the
history
of
his
country
as
a
mere
pageant
of
warring
royalties
and
their
trains
when
the
people
are
permitted
to
appear
as
they
do

ever
a
feather
so
lightly
blown
to
and
fro
as
this
multitude

in
the
stage
directions
of
this
scene
shakespeare
shows
his
own
opinion
of
the
mob
by
writing
enter
cade
and
his
rabblement
one
looks
in
vain
here
as
in
the
roman
plays
for
a
suggestion
that
poor
people
sometimes
suffer
wrongfully
from
hunger
and
want
that
they
occasionally
have
just
grievances
and
that
their
efforts
to
present
them
so
far
from
being
ludicrous
are
the
most
serious
parts
of
history
beside
which
the
struttings
of
kings
and
courtiers
sink
into
insignificance
one
of
the
popular
songs
in
tyler
rebellion
was
the
familiar
couplet
when
adam
delved
and
eve
span
who
was
then
the
gentleman
shakespeare
refers
to
it
in
hamlet
where
the
speak
as
follows
first
clown
come
my
spade
there
is
no
ancient
gentleman
but
gardners
ditchers
and
they
hold
up

how
dost
thou

the
scripture
the
scripture
says
adam
digged
could
he
dig
without
arms
act
sc
that
shakespeare
caricature
of
tyler
rebellion
is
a
fair
indication
of
his
view
of
all
popular
risings
appears
from
the
remarks
addressed
by
westmoreland
to
the
archbishop
of
york
in
the
second
part
of
henry
iv
act
sc
says
he
if
that
rebellion
came
like
itself
in
base
and
abject
routs
led
on
by
bloody
youth
guarded
with
rags
and
countenanced
by
boys
and
beggary
i
say
if
damned
commotion
so
appeared
in
his
true
native
and
most
proper
shape
you
reverend
father
and
these
noble
lords
had
not
been
here
to
dress
the
ugly
form
of
base
and
bloody
insurrection
with
your
fair
honors
the
first
and
last
of
shakespeare
english
historical
plays
king
john
and
henry
lie
beyond
the
limits
of
the
civil
wars
and
each
of
them
treats
of
a
period
momentous
in
the
annals
of
english
liberty
a
fact
which
shakespeare
absolutely
ignores
john
as
king
had
two
great
misfortunes
he
suffered
disgrace
at
the
hands
of
his
barons
and
of
the
pope
the
first
event
the
wringing
of
magna
charta
from
the
king
shakespeare
passes
over
a
sense
of
national
pride
might
have
excused
the
omission
of
the
latter
humiliation
but
no
it
was
a
triumph
of
authority
and
as
such
shakespeare
must
record
it
for
the
edification
of
his
hearers
and
consequently
we
have
the
king
presented
on
the
stage
as
meekly
receiving
the
crown
from
the
papal
legate
act
sc
england
was
freed
from
the
roman
yoke
in
the
reign
of
henry
and
in
the
drama
of
that
name
shakespeare
might
have
balanced
the
indignity
forced
upon
king
john
but
now
he
is
silent
nothing
must
be
said
against
authority
even
against
that
of
the
pope
and
the
play
culminates
in
the
pomp
and
parade
of
the
christening
of
the
infant
elizabeth
such
is
shakespeare
conception
of
history
who
could
guess
from
reading
these
english
historical
plays
that
throughout
the
period
which
they
cover
english
freedom
was
growing
that
justice
and
the
rights
of
man
were
asserting
themselves
while
despotism
was
gradually
curbed
and
limited
this
is
the
one
great
glory
of
english
history
exhibiting
itself
at
runnymede
reflected
in
wyclif
and
john
ball
and
wat
tyler
and
shining
dimly
in
the
birth
of
a
national
church
under
the
eighth
henry
as
shakespeare
wrote
it
was
preparing
for
a
new
and
conspicuous
outburst
when
he
died
oliver
cromwell
was
already
seventeen
years
of
age
and
john
hampden
the
spirit
of
hampden
was
preeminently
the
english
spirit
the
spirit
which
has
given
distinction
to
the
race
and
he
and
shakespeare
were
contemporaries
and
yet
of
this
spirit
not
a
vestige
is
to
be
found
in
the
english
historical
plays
and
no
opportunities
lost
to
obliterate
or
distort
its
manifestations
only
in
brutus
and
his
of
all
shakespearian
characters
do
we
find
the
least
consideration
for
liberty
and
even
then
he
makes
the
common
and
perhaps
in
his
time
the
unavoidable
mistake
of
overlooking
the
genuinely
democratic
leanings
of
julius
cæsar
and
the
character
of
the
successful
plot
against
him
it
has
in
all
ages
been
a
pastime
of
noble
minds
to
try
to
depict
a
perfect
state
of
society
forty
years
before
shakespeare
birth
sir
thomas
more
published
his
utopia
to
the
world
bacon
intended
to
do
the
same
thing
in
the
new
atlantis
but
never
completed
the
work
while
sir
philip
sidney
gives
us
his
dream
in
his
arcadia
montaigne
makes
a
similar
essay
and
we
quote
from
florio
translation
published
in
the
following
passage

i

the
very
words
that
import
lying
falsehood
treason
dissimulation
covetousness
envy
detraction
and
pardon
were
never
heard
among
them
we
may
readily
infer
that
shakespeare
found
little
to
sympathize
with
in
this
somewhat
extravagant
outline
of
a
happy
nation
but
he
goes
out
of
his
way
to
travesty

tempest

sc
that
all

the
best
in
the
best
of
all

would
seem
to
result
from
the
wise
remarks
made
by
the
fishermen
who
enliven
the
scene
in
pericles
prince
of
tyre
they
compare
landlords
to
whales
who
swallow
up
everything
and
suggest
that
the
land
be
purged
of
these
drones
that
rob
the
bee
of
her
honey
and
pericles
so
far
from
being
shocked
at
such
revolutionary
and
vulgar
sentiments
is
impressed
by
their
weight
and
speaks
kindly
of
the
humble
philosophers
who
in
their
turn
are
hospitable
to
the
shipwrecked
prince
all
of
which
matter
adds
doubt
to
the
authenticity
of
this
drama
act
sc
however
keen
the
insight
of
shakespeare
may
have
been
into
the
hearts
of
his
characters
he
had
no
conception
of
the
unity
of
the
human
race
for
him
the
prince
and
the
peasant
were
not
of
the
same
blood
for
princes
are
a
model
which
heaven
makes
like
to
itself
says
king
simonides
in
pericles
and
here
at
least
we
seem
to
see
the
hand
of
shakespeare

sc
the
two
princes
guiderius
and
arviragus

up
secretly

a
cave

royal
origin

a
matter
of
course
witness
edmund

much
ado

high

in
so
far
as
the
lower

had
any
relation
to
the
upper

it
was
one
thought
shakespeare
of
dependence
and
obligation
it
was
not
the
tiller
of
the
soil
who
fed
the
lord
of
the
manor
but
rather
the
lord
who
supported
the
peasant
does
not
the
king
have
to
lie
awake
and
take
thought
for
his
subjects
thus
henry
complains
that
he
can
not
sleep
so
soundly
as
the
wretched

with
a
body
filled
and
vacant

these
lines
occur
at
the
end

passage

which
the

oppresses

confesses
that

for
it

enough
but
savors
of
cant
in
the
mouths
of
men

fought
long
and
hard
to
maintain
themselves
upon
their
thrones
we
have
already
shown
by
references
to
the
contemporary
drama
that
the
plea
of
custom
is
not
sufficient
to
explain
shakespeare
attitude
to
the
lower
classes
but
if
we
widen
our
survey
to
the
entire
field
of
english
letters
in
his
day
we
shall
see
that
he
was
running
counter
to
all
the
best
traditions
of
our
literature
from
the
time
of
piers
plowman
down
the
peasant
had
stood
high
with
the
great
writers
of
poetry
and
prose
alike
chaucer
famous
circle
of
at
the
tabard
inn
in
southwark
was
eminently
democratic
with
the
knight
and
the
friar
were
gathered
together
an
haberdasher
and
a
carpenter
a
webbe
a
deyer
and
tapiser
and
the
tales
of
the
cook
and
the
miller
take
rank
with
those
of
the
squire
and
lawyer
the
english
bible
too
was
in
shakespeare
hands
and
he
must
have
been
familiar
with
shepherd
kings
and
in
the
very
year
in
which
hamlet
first
appeared
a
work
was
published
in
spain
which
was
at
once
translated
into
english
a
work
as
well
known
as
shakespeare
own
writings
if
the
peasantry
was
anywhere
to
be
neglected
and
despised
where
should
it
be
rather
than
in
proud
aristocratic
spain
and
yet
to
place
beside
shakespeare
bottoms
and
slys
cervantes
has
given
us
the
admirable
sancho
panza
and
has
spread
his
loving
humor
in
equal
measure
over
servant
and
master
are
we
to
believe
that
the
yeomen
of
england
who
beat
back
the
armada
were
inferior
to
the
spanish
peasantry
whom
they
overcame
or
is
it
not
rather
true
that
the
spanish
author
had
a
deeper
insight
into
his
country
heart
than
was
allotted
to
the
english
dramatist
cervantes
the
soldier
and
adventurer
rose
above
the
prejudices
of
his
class
while
shakespeare
never
lifted
his
eyes
beyond
the
narrow
horizon
of
the
court
to
which
he
catered
it
was
love
that
opened
cervantes
eye
and
it
is
in
love
that
shakespeare
was
deficient
as
far
as
the
common
people
were
concerned
he
never
held
the
mirror
up
to
nature
but
the
book
of
all
others
which
might
have
suggested
to
shakespeare
that
there
was
more
in
the
claims
of
the
lower
classes
than
was
dreamt
of
in
his
philosophy
was
more
utopia
which
in
its
english
form
was
already
a
classic
more
the
richest
and
most
powerful
man
in
england
after
the
king
not
only
believed
in
the
workingman
but
knew
that
he
suffered
from
unjust
social
conditions
he
could
never
have
represented
the
followers
of
nor
the
hungry
mob
in
coriolanus
with
the
utter
lack
of
sympathy
which
shakespeare
manifests
what
justice
is
there
in
this
asks
the
great
lord
chancellor
whose
character
stood
the
test
of
death
what
justice
is
there
in
this
that
a
nobleman
a
goldsmith
a
banker
or
any
other
man
that
either
does
nothing
at
all
or
at
best
is
employed
in
things
that
are
of
no
use
to
the
public
should
live
in
great
luxury
and
splendor
upon
what
is
so
ill
acquired
and
a
mean
man
a
carter
a
smith
a
plowman
that
works
harder
even
than
the
beasts
themselves
and
is
employed
on
labors
so
necessary
that
no
commonwealth
could
hold
out
a
year
without
them
can
only
earn
so
poor
a
livelihood
and
must
lead
so
miserable
a
life
that
the
condition
of
the
beasts
is
much
better
than
theirs
how
different

this

those
works
in
which
the
author
instead
of
accepting
the
current
morality
and
religion
without
any
question
as
to
their
validity
writes
from
an
original
moral
standpoint
of
his
own
thereby
making
his
book
an
original
contribution
to
morals
religion
and
sociology
as
well
as
to
i
place
shakespeare
with
dickens
scott
dumas
père
in
the
second
order
because
tho
they
are
enormously
entertaining
their
morality
is
and
i
point
out
that
the
one
play
hamlet
in
which
shakespeare
made
an
attempt
to
give
as
a
hero
one
who
was
dissatisfied
with
the
morality
is
the
one
which
has
given
the
highest
impression
of
his
genius
altho
hamlet
revolt
is
unskillfully
and
inconclusively
suggested
and
not
worked
out
with
any
philosophic
competence
may
i
suggest
that
you
should
be
careful
not
to
imply
that
great
shakespearian
heresy
has
no
other
support
than
mine
the
preface
of
nicholas
rowe
to
his
edition
of
shakespeare
and
the
various
prefaces
of
johnson
contain
on
rowe
part
an
apology
for
him
as
a
writer
with
obvious
and
admitted
shortcomings
very
ridiculously
ascribed
by
rowe
to
his
working
by
a
mere
light
of
nature
and
on
johnson
a
good
deal
of
downright
criticism
you
should
also
look
up
the
history
of
the
ireland
forgeries
unless
as
is
very
probable
tolstoy
has
anticipated
you
in
this
among
poets
byron
and
william
morris
saw
clearly
that
shakespeare
was
enormously
overrated
intellectually
a
french
book
which
has
been
translated
into
english
has
appeared
within
the
last
ten
years
giving
opinions
of
the
drama
his
insistence
on
the
superiority
of
corneille
to
shakespeare
on
the
ground
of
corneille
power
of
grasping
a
political
situation
and
of
seeing
men
in
their
relation
to
the
state
is
interesting
of
course
you
know
about
voltaire
criticisms
which
are
the
more
noteworthy
because
voltaire
began
with
an
extravagant
admiration
for
shakespeare
and
got
more
and
more
bitter
against
him
as
he
grew
older
and
less
disposed
to
accept
artistic
merit
as
a
cover
for
philosophic
deficiencies
finally
i
for
one
shall
value
tolstoy
criticism
all
the
more
because
it
is
criticism
of
a
foreigner
who
can
not
possibly
be
enchanted
by
the
mere
which
makes
shakespeare
so
irresistible
in
england
in
tolstoy
estimation
shakespeare
must
fall
or
stand
as
a
thinker
in
which
capacity
i
do
not
think
he
will
stand
a
examination
from
so
tremendously
keen
a
critic
and
religious
realist
unfortunately
the
english
worship
their
great
artists
quite
indiscriminately
and
abjectly
so
that
is
quite
impossible
to
make
them
understand
that
shakespeare
extraordinary
literary
power
his
fun
his
mimicry
and
the
endearing
qualities
that
earned
him
the
title
of
the
gentle
shakespeare
all
of
which
whatever
tolstoy
may
say
are
quite
unquestionable
facts
do
not
stand
or
fall
with
his
absurd
reputation
as
a
thinker
tolstoy
will
certainly
treat
that
side
of
his
reputation
with
the
severity
it
deserves
and
you
will
find
that
the
english
press
will
instantly
announce
that
tolstoy
considers
his
own
works
greater
than
shakespeare
which
in
some
respects
they
most
certainly
are
by
the
way
and
that
he
has
attempted
to
stigmatize
our
greatest
poet
as
a
liar
a
thief
a
forger
a
murderer
an
incendiary
a
drunkard
a
libertine
a
fool
a
madman
a
coward
a
vagabond
and
even
a
man
of
questionable
gentility
you
must
not
be
surprised
or

at

worth

quality
in

what
is
art
translated
from
the
original
manuscript
with
an
introduction
by
aylmer
maude
art
is
a
human
activity
declares
tolstoy
the
object
of
this
activity
is
to
transmit
to
others
feelings
the
artist
has
experienced
by
certain
external
signs
movements
lines
colors
sounds
or
arrangements
of
words
an
artist
infects
other
people
so
that
they
share
his
feelings
thus
art
is
a
means
of
union
among
men
joining
them
together
in
the
same
feeling
without
adequate
expression
there
is
no
art
for
there
is
no
infection
no
transference
to
others
of
the
author
feeling
the
test
of
art
is
infection
if
an
author
has
moved
you
so
that
you
feel
as
he
felt
if
you
are
so
united
to
him
in
feeling
that
it
seems
to
you
that
he
has
expressed
just
what
you
have
long
wished
to
express
the
work
that
has
so
infected
you
is
a
work
of
art
a
powerful
work
full
of
genius
and
originality
the
powerful
personality
of
the
author
the
startling
originality
of
his
views
grip
the
reader
and
carry
him
though
his
deepest
convictions
be
outraged
protesting
through

the
discussion
is
bound
to
shake

world
to
its
very
center
and
to
result
in
a
considerable
readjustment
of
theories
it
is
the
ablest
and
most
