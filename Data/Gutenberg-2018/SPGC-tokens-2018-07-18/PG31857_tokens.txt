a
winter
courtship
the
passenger
and
mail
transportation
between
the
towns
of
north
kilby
and
sanscrit
pond
was
carried
on
by
jefferson
briley
whose
covered
wagon
was
usually
much
too
large
for
the
demands
of
business
both
the
sanscrit
pond
and
north
kilby
people
were
and
briley
often
made
his
journey
in
entire
solitude
except
for
the
limp
leather
which
he
held
firmly
to
the
floor
of
the
carriage
with
his
heavily
shod
left
foot
the
had
almost
a
personality
to
him
born
of
long
association
briley
was
a
meek
and
body
but
he
held
a
warlike
soul
and
encouraged
his
fancies
by
reading
awful
tales
of
bloodshed
and
lawlessness
in
the
far
west
mindful
of
stage
robberies
and
train
thieves
and
of
express
messengers
who
died
at
their
posts
he
was
prepared
for
anything
and
although
he
had
trusted
to
his
own
strength
and
bravery
these
many
years
he
carried
a
heavy
pistol
under
his
cushion
for
better
defense
this
awful
weapon
was
familiar
to
all
his
regular
passengers
and
was
usually
shown
to
strangers
by
the
time
two
of
the
seven
miles
of
briley
route
had
been
passed
the
pistol
was
not
loaded
nobody
at
least
not
briley
himself
doubted
that
the
mere
sight
of
such
a
weapon
would
turn
the
boldest
adventurer
aside
protected
by
such
a
man
and
such
a
piece
of
armament
one
gray
friday
morning
in
the
edge
of
winter
fanny
tobin
was
traveling
from
sanscrit
pond
to
north
kilby
she
was
an
elderly
and
woman
but
with
a
shrewd
twinkle
in
her
eyes
and
she
felt
very
anxious
about
her
numerous
pieces
of
baggage
and
her
own
personal
safety
she
was
enveloped
in
many
shawls
and
smaller
wrappings
but
they
were
not
securely
fastened
and
kept
getting
undone
and
flying
loose
so
that
the
bitter
december
cold
seemed
to
be
picking
a
lock
now
and
then
and
creeping
in
to
steal
away
the
little
warmth
she
had
briley
was
cold
too
and
could
only
cheer
himself
by
remembering
the
valor
of
those
drivers
of
the
days
who
had
to
cross
the
rocky
mountains
on
the
great
california
route
he
spoke
at
length
of
their
perils
to
the
suffering
passenger
who
felt
none
the
warmer
and
at
last
gave
a
groan
of
weariness
how
fur
did
you
say
was
now
i
do
know
i
said
mis
tobin
answered
the
driver
with
a
frosty
laugh
you
see
them
big
pines
and
the
side
of
a
barn
just
this
way
with
them
yellow
circus
bills
that
my
mark
be
we
got
four
more
to
make
oh
my
laws
mourned
tobin
urge
the
beast
ca
ye
i
ai
used
to
bein
out
in
such
bleak
weather
seems
if
i
could
git
my
breath
i
all
pinched
up
and
wigglin
with
shivers
now
ai
no
use
lettin
the
hoss
go
this
fashion
landy

exclaimed
the
affronted
driver
i
do
see
why
folks
expects
me
to
race
with
the
cars
everybody
that
gits
in
wants
me
to
run
the
hoss
to
death
on
the
road
i
make
a
good
everage
o
time
and
that
all
i
do
ef

to
go

but

eighteen
years
want
to

all
you

and
let

out
o
their

years
together
and
the
creatur

so
to
say
young
when
we
begun
it
nor
i
neither
i
did
know
she
hold
out
till
this
time
there
git
up
will
ye
old
mar
as
the
beast
of
burden
stopped
short
in
the
road
there
was
a
story
that
jefferson
gave
this
faithful
creature
a
rest
three
times
a
mile
and
took
four
hours
for
the
journey
by
himself
and
longer
whenever
he
had
a
passenger
but
in
pleasant
weather
the
road
was
delightful
and
full
of
people
who
drove
their
own
conveyances
and
liked
to
stop
and
talk
there
were
not
many
farms
and
the
third
growth
of
white
pines
made
a
pleasant
shade
though
jefferson
liked
to
say
that
when
he
began
to
carry
the
mail
his
way
lay
through
an
open
country
of
stumps
and
sparse
underbrush
where
the
white
pines
nowadays
completely
arched
the
road
they
had
passed
the
barn
with
circus
posters
and
felt
colder
than
ever
when
they
caught
sight
of
the
acrobats
in
their
tights
my
gorry
exclaimed
widow
tobin
them
pore
creatur
looks
as
cheerless
as
little
in
i
hope
they
dresses
warmer
this
time
o
year
now
there
look
at
that
one
jumpin
through
the
little
hoop
will
ye
he
could
git
himself
through
there
with
two
pair
o
pants
on
answered
briley
i
expect
they
must
have
to
keep
limber
as
eels
i
used
to
think
when
i
was
a
boy
that
was
the
only
thing
i
could
ever
be
reconciled
to
do
for
a
livin
i
set
out
to
run
away
follow
a
rovin
showman
once
but
mother
needed
me
to
home
there
war
nobody
but
me
an
the
little
gals
you
ai
the
only
one
that
o
their
desire
said
tobin
sadly
war
so
that
i
could
be
spared
from
home
to
learn
the
dressmaker
trade
would
a
come
handy
later
on
i
declare
answered
the
sympathetic
driver
bein
you
went
an
had
such
a
passel
o
gals
to
clothe
feed
there
them
that
livin
is
all
well
off
now
but
it
must
been
some
inconvenient
for
ye
when
they
was
small
yes
briley
but
then
i
had
my
mercies
too
said
the
widow
somewhat
grudgingly
i
take
it
master
hard
now
though
havin
to
give
up
my
own
home
and
live
round
from
place
to
place
if
they
be
my
own
there
was
and
susan
ellen
fussin
an
yesterday
about
who

to
have
me
next
and
lord
be
thanked
they
both
wanted
me
right
off
but
i
hated
to
hear
talkin
of
it
over
i
rather
live
to
home
and
do
for
myself
i
got
used
to
boardin
said
jefferson
sence
died
but
it
made
me
ache
at
the
fust
o
i
tell
ye
bein
on
the
road
i
be
i
could
do
no
ways
at
keepin
house
i
should
want
to
keep
right
there
and
see
to
things
course
you
would
replied
tobin
with
a
sudden
inspiration
of
opportunity
which
sent
a
welcome
glow
all
over
her
course
you
would
she
leaned
toward
the
front
seat
that
is
to
say
onless
you
had
jest
the
right
one
to
do
it
for
ye
and
jefferson
felt
a
strange
glow
also
and
a
sense
of
unexpected
interest
and
enjoyment
see
here
sister
tobin
he
exclaimed
with
enthusiasm
why
ca
ye
take
the
trouble
to
shift
seats
and
come
front
here
long
o
me
we
could
put
one
top
o
the
other
they
both
thin
and
set
close
and
i
do
know
but
we
sh
be
more
protected
the
weather
well
i
could
be
no
colder
if
i
was
froze
to
death
answered
the
widow
with
an
amiable
simper
do
ye
let
me
delay
you
nor
put
you
out
briley
i
do
know
i
set
forth
if
i
was
so
cold
but
i
had
all
my
bundles
done
up
and
i
ai
one
that
puts
my
hand
to
the
plough
an
looks
back
to
scriptur
you
would
wanted
me
to
ride
all
them
seven
miles
alone
asked
the
gallant
briley
sentimentally
as
he
lifted
her
down
and
helped
her
up
again
to
the
front
seat
she
was
a
few
years
older
than
he
but
they
had
been
schoolmates
and
tobin
youthful
freshness
was
suddenly
revived
to
his
mind
eye
she
had
a
little
farm
there
was
nobody
left
at
home
now
but
herself
and
so
she
had
broken
up
housekeeping
for
the
winter
jefferson
himself
had
savings
of
no
mean
amount
they
tucked
themselves
in
and
felt
better
for
the
change
but
there
was
a
sudden
awkwardness
between
them
they
had
not
had
time
to
prepare
for
an
unexpected
crisis
they
say
elder
bickers
over
to
east
sanscrit
been
and
got
married
again
to
a
gal
that
four
year
younger
than
his
oldest
daughter
proclaimed
tobin
presently
seems
to
me
was
business
i
view
it
so
said
the
there
goin
to
be
a
mild
open
winter
for
that
what
a
joker
you
be
for
a
man
that
had
so
much
responsibility
smiled
tobin
after
they
had
done
laughing
ai
you
never
carryin
mail
matter
and
such
valuable
stuff
that
you
be
set
on
an
robbed
by
night
jefferson
braced
his
feet
against
the
dasher
under
the
worn
buffalo
skin
it
is
kind
o
scary
or
would
be
for
some
folks
but
i
like
to
see
anybody
get
the
better
o
me
i
go
armed
and
i
do
care
who
knows
it
some
o
them
drover
men
that
comes
from
canady
looks
as
if
they
did
care
what
they
did
but
i
look
right
in
the
eye
every
time
men
folks
is
brave
by
natur
said
the
widow
admiringly
you
know
how
tobin
would
let
his
fist
right
out
at
anybody
that
ondertook
to
sass
him
days
if
he
got
disappointed
about
the
way
things
went
he
lay
out
in
and
ef
he
had
been
a
he
been
a
real
fightin
character
i
was
always
to
have
him
roused
for
all
he
was
so
willin
and
meechin
to
home
and
set
round
clever
as
anybody
my
susan
ellen
used
to
boss
him
same
the
kitten
when
she
was
four
year
old
i
got
a
kind
of
a
sideways
cant
to
my
nose
that
tobin
give
me
when
we
was
to
school
i
do
know
you
ever
noticed
it
said
briley
we
was
scufflin
as
lads
will
i
never
bore
him
no
kind
of
a
grudge
i
pitied
ye
when
he
was
taken
away
i
did
now
fanny
i
liked
tobin
and
i
liked
you
i
used
to
say
you
was
the
girl
to
school
lem
me
see
your
nose
is
all
straight
for
what
i
know
said
the
widow
gently
as
with
a
trace
of
coyness
she
gave
a
hasty
glance
i
do
know
but
what
is
warped
a
little
but
nothin
to
speak
of
you
got
real
nice
features
like
your
marm
folks
it
was
becoming
a
sentimental
occasion
and
jefferson
briley
felt
that
he
was
in
for
something
more
than
he
had
bargained
he
hurried
the
faltering
sorrel
horse
and
began
to
talk
of
the
weather
it
certainly
did
look
like
snow
and
he
was
tired
of
bumping
over
the
frozen
road
i
should
wonder
if
i
hired
a
hand
here
another
year
and
went
off
out
west
myself
to
see
the
country
why
how
you
talk
answered
the
widow
yes
pursued
jefferson
is
tamer
here
than
i
like
and
i
was
tellin
yesterday
i
got
to
know
this
road
most
too
well
like
to
go
out
an
ride
in
the
mountains
with
some
o
them
great
clipper
coaches
where
the
driver
do
know
one
minute
but
he
be
shot
dead
the
next
they
carry
an
awful
sight
o
gold
down
from
the
mines
i
expect
i
should
be
scairt
to
death
said
tobin
what
creatur
men
folks
be
to
like
such
things
well
i
do
declare
yes

the
mild
little
man
there

a
livin
out
o
followin
them
coaches
an
an
robbin
clean
to
the
bone
your
money

life
and
he
flourished
his
stub
of
a
whip
over
the
sorrel
mare
landy
me
you
make
me
run
all
of
a
cold
creep
do
tell
heartenin
this
cold
day
i
shall
dream
bad
dreams
all
night
they
put
on
black
crape
over
their
heads
said
the
driver
mysteriously
nobody
knows
who
most
on
be
and
like
as
not
some
o
them
fellows
come
o
good
families
they
got
so
they
stop
the
cars
and
go
right
through
bold
as
brass
i
could
make
your
hair
stand
on
end
mis
tobin
i
could
i
hope
none
on

round
our
way
i
sure
said
fanny
tobin
i
do
want

see
none
on
in
their
crape
bunnits
after
me
i
ai
goin
to
let
nobody
touch
a
hair
o
your
head
and
briley
moved
a
little
nearer
and
tucked
in
the
buffaloes
again
i
feel
considerable
warm
to
what
i
did
observed
the
widow
by
way
of
reward
there
i
used
to
have
my
fears
briley
resumed
with
an
inward
feeling
that
he
never
would
get
to
north
kilby
depot
a
single
man
but
you
see
i
had
nobody
but
myself
to
think
of
i
got
cousins
as
you
know
but
nothin
nearer
and
what
i
laid
up
would
soon
be
parted
out
and
well
i
suppose
some
folks
would
think
o
me
if
anything
was
to
happen
tobin
was
holding
her
cloud
over
her
face
the
wind
was
sharp
on
that
bit
of
open
road
but
she
gave
an
encouraging
sound
between
a
groan
and
a
chirp
would
be
like
nothin
to
me
not
to
see
you
drivin
by
she
said
after
a
minute
i
should

the
days

headin
toward
north
kilby
so
we
found
i

to
be
a
featur
of
the
landscape
said
briley
plaintively
this
kind
o
weather
the
old
mare
and
me
we
wish
we
was
done
with
it
and
could
settle
down
kind
o
comfortable
i

good
while
as
i
drove

i
ca

protested
the
lover
ai
for
lack
o
opportunities
set
afore
me
nuther
and
then
briley
craftily
kept
silence
as
if
he
had
made
a
fair
proposal
and
expected
a
definite
reply
the
lady
of
his
choice
was
as
she
might
have
expressed
it
much
beat
about
as
she
soberly
thought
she
was
getting
along
in
years
and
must
put
up
with
jefferson
all
the
rest
of
the
time
it
was
not
likely
she
would
ever
have
the
chance
of
choosing
again
though
she
was
one
who
liked
variety
jefferson
was
much
to
look
at
but
he
was
pleasant
and
appeared
boyish
and
i
do
know
i
should
do
better
she
said
unconsciously
and
half
aloud
well

but

on
us

an
may
have
kind
looked
forward
to
a
little
ease
but
one
on
would
be
left
lamentin
anyhow
and
she
gave
a
girlish
laugh
an
air
of
victory
animated
the
frame
of
tobin
she
felt
but
years
of
age
in
that
moment
she
made
plans
for
cutting
her
briley
hair
and
making
him
look
and
ambitious
then
she
wished
that
she
knew
for
certain
how
much
money
he
had
in
the
bank
not
that
it
would
make
any
difference
now
he
need
bluster
none
before
me
she
thought
gayly
he
harmless
as
a
fly
who
have
thought
we
done
such
a
piece
of
engineerin
when
we
started
out
inquired
the
dear
one
of
briley
heart
as
he
tenderly
helped
her
to
alight
at
susan
ellen
door
both
on
us
jest
the
least
grain
answered
the
lover
gim
me
a
good
smack
now
you
clever
creatur
and
so
they
parted
briley
had
been
taken
on
the
road
in
spite
of
his
pistol
the
mistress
of
sydenham
plantation
a
high
wind
was
blowing
from
the
water
into
the
beaufort
streets
a
wind
with
as
much
reckless
hilarity
as
march
could
give
to
her
breezes
but
soft
and
almost
in
its
warmth
in
the
gardens
of
the
old
southern
houses
that
stood
along
the
bay
roses
and
were
blooming
with
their
delicious
fragrance
it
was
the
time
of
wistarias
and
wild
white
lilies
of
the
last
yellow
and
the
first
cherokee
roses
it
was
the
saturday
before
easter
sunday
in
the
quaint
churchyard
of
old
helena
church
a
little
way
from
the
bay
young
figures
were
busy
among
the
graves
with
industrious
gardening
at
first
sight
one
might
have
thought
that
this
pretty
service
was
rendered
only
from
loving
sentiments
of
loyalty
to
ancestors
for
under
the
great
the
sturdy
brick
walls
about
the
family
and
the
gravestones
themselves
were
and
yet
here
and
there
the
wounded
look
of
the
earth
appealed
to
the
eye
and
betrayed
a
grave
the
old
sarcophagi
and
heavy
tablets
of
the
historic
beaufort
families
stood
side
by
side
with
plain
wooden
crosses
the
armorial
bearings
and
long
epitaphs
of
the
one
and
the
brief
lettering
of
the
other
suggested
the
changes
that
had
come
with
the
war
to
these
families
yet
somehow
the
wooden
cross
touched
one
heart
with
closer
sympathy
the
padlocked
gates
to
the
small
inclosures
stood
open
while
gentle
girls
passed
in
and
out
with
their
easter
flowers
of
remembrance
on
the
high
churchyard
wall
and
great
perched
many
a
and
the
golden
light
changed
the
twilight
under
the
to
a
misty
warmth
of
color
the
birds
began
to
sing
louder
the
gray
moss
that
hung
from
the
heavy
boughs
swayed
less
and
less
and
gave
the
place
a
look
of
pensive
silence
in
the
church
itself
most
of
the
palms
and
rose
branches
were
already
in
place
for
the
next
day
feast
and
the
old
organ
followed
a
fresh
young
voice
that
was
being
trained
for
the
easter
anthem
the
five
doors
of
the
church
were
standing
open
on
the
steps
of
that
eastern
door
which
opened
midway
up
the
side
aisle
where
the
morning
sun
had
shone
in
upon
the
white
faces
of
a
hospital
in
in
this
eastern
doorway
sat
two
young
women
i
was
just
thinking
one
was
saying
to
the
other
that
for
the
first
time
mistress
sydenham
has
forgotten
to
keep
this
day
you
know
that
when
she
has
forgotten
everything
and
everybody
else
she
has
known
when
easter
came
and
has
brought
flowers
to
her
graves
has
she
been
more
feeble
lately
do
you
think
asked
the
younger
of
the
two
mamma
saw
her
the
other
day
and
thought
that
she
seemed
more
like
herself
but
she
looked
very
old
too
she
told
mamma
to
bring
her
dolls
and
she
would
give
her
some
bits
of
silk
to
make
them
gowns
poor
mamma
and
she
had
just
been
wondering
how
she
could
manage
to
get
us
ready
for
summer
this
year
célestine
and
me
and
the
speaker
smiled
wistfully
it
is
a
mercy
that
the
dear
old
lady
did
forget
all
that
happened
and
the
friends
brushed
some
last
bits
of
leaves
from
their
skirts
and
rose
and
walked
away
together
through
the
churchyard
the
ancient
church
waited
through
another
easter
even
with
its
flowers
and
long
memory
of
prayer
and
praise
the
great
earthquake
had
touched
it
lightly
time
had
colored
it
softly
and
the
earthly
bodies
of
its
children
were
gathered
near
its
walls
in
peaceful
sleep
from
one
of
the
high
houses
which
stood
fronting
the
sea
with
their
airy
balconies
and
colonnades
had
come
a
small
slender
figure
like
some
shy
dark
thing
of
twilight
out
into
the
bright
sunshine
the
street
was
empty
for
the
most
part
before
one
or
two
of
the
cheap
german
shops
a
group
of
men
watched
the
little
old
lady
step
proudly
by
she
was
a
very
stately
gentlewoman
for
one
so
small
and
thin
she
was
feeble
too
and
bending
somewhat
with
the
weight
of
years
but
there
was
true
elegance
and
dignity
in
the
way
she
moved
and
those
who
saw
her
persons
who
shuffled
when
they
walked
and
boasted
loudly
of
the
fallen
pride
of
the
south
were
struck
with
sudden
deference
and
admiration
behind
the
lady
walked
a
negro
a
man
who
was
troubled
in
spirit
who
sometimes
gained
a
step
or
two
and
offered
an
anxious
but
quite
unheeded
remonstrance
he
was
a
poor
tottering
old
fellow
he
wore
a
threadbare
evening
coat
that
might
have
belonged
to
his
late
master
thirty
years
before
the
pair
went
slowly
along
the
bay
street
to
the
end
of
a
row
of
new
shops
and
the
lady
turned
decidedly
toward
the
water
and
approached
the
her
servitor
groaned
aloud
but
waited
in
respectful
helplessness
there
was
a
group
of
negro
children
on
the
steps
employed
in
the
dangerous
business
of
at
the
foot
in
his
boat
sat
a
wondering
negro
lad
who
looked
up
in
apprehension
at
his
passengers
the
lady
seemed
like
a
ghost
old
peter
with
whose
scorn
of
modern
beings
and
their
ways
he
was
partially
familiar
old
peter
was
making
frantic
signs
to
him
to
put
out
from
shore
but
the
lady
calm
desire
for
obedience
prevailed
and
presently
out
of
the
knot
of
idlers
that
gathered
quickly
one
more
chivalrous
than
the
rest
helped
the
strange
adventurers
down
into
the
boat
it
was
the
fashion
to
laugh
and
joke
in
beaufort
when
anything
unusual
was
happening
before
the
eyes
of
the
younger
part
of
the
colored
population
but
as
the
ferryman
pushed
off
from
shore
even
the
kept
silence
and
there
were
speechless
open
mouths
and
much
questioning
of
eyes
that
showed
their
whites
in
vain
somehow
or
other
before
the
boat
was
out
of
hail
long
before
it
had
passed
the
first
bank
of
raccoon
oysters
the
tide
being
at
the
ebb
it
was
known
by
fifty
people
that
for
the
first
time
in
more
than
twenty
years
the
mistress
of
the
old
sydenham
plantation
on
helena
island
had
taken
it
into
her
poor
daft
head
to
go
to
look
after
her
estates
her
crops
and
her
people
everybody
knew
that
her
estates
had
been
confiscated
during
the
war
that
her
people
owned
it
themselves
now
in
three
and
five
and
even
twenty
acre
lots
that
her
crops
of
rice
and
sea
island
cotton
were
theirs
planted
and
hoed
and
harvested
on
their
own
account
all
these
years
she
had
forgotten
sydenham
and
the
avenue
and
the
outlook
across
the
water
to
the
hunting
islands
where
the
deer
ran
wild
she
had
forgotten
the
war
she
had
forgotten
her
children
and
her
husband
except
that
they
had
gone
away
the
graves
to
which
she
carried
easter
flowers
were
her
mother
and
her
father
graves
and
her
life
was
spent
in
a
strange
dream
old
peter
sat
facing
her
in
the
boat
the
ferryman
pulled
lustily
at
his
oars
and
they
moved
quickly
along
in
the
ebbing
tide
the
ferryman
longed
to
get
his
freight
safely
across
he
was
in
a
fret
of
discomfort
whenever
he
looked
at
the
eager
face
before
him
in
the
stern
how
still
and
straight
the
old
mistress
sat
where
was
she
going
he
was
awed
by
her
presence
and
took
refuge
as
he
rowed
in
needless
talk
about
the
coming
of
the
sandflies
and
the
great
to
beaufort
waters
but
peter
had
clasped
his
hands
together
and
bowed
his
old
back
as
if
he
did
not
dare
to
look
anywhere
but
at
the
bottom
of
the
boat
peter
was
still
groaning
softly
the
old
lady
was
looking
back
over
the
water
to
the
row
of
fine
houses
the
once
luxurious
summer
homes
of
rhetts
and
barnwells
of
many
a
famous
household
now
scattered
and
impoverished
the
ferryman
had
heard
of
more
one
than
bereft
lady
or
gentleman
who
lived
in
seclusion
in
the
old
houses
he
knew
that
peter
still
served
a
mysterious
mistress
with
exact
devotion
while
most
of
the
elderly
colored
men
and
women
who
had
formed
the
retinues
of
the
old
families
were
following
their
own
affairs
far
and
wide
oh
lord
ole
mis
what
kin
i
go
to
do
mumbled
peter
with
his
head
in
his
hands
thar
be
nothin
to
see
po
ole
mis
i
kno
what
you
say
trouble
trouble
but
the
mistress
of
sydenham
plantation
had
a
way
of
speaking
but
seldom
and
of
rarely
listening
to
what
any
one
was
pleased
to
say
in
return
out
of
the
mistiness
of
her
clouded
brain
a
thought
had
come
with
unwonted
clearness
she
must
go
to
the
island
her
husband
and
sons
were
detained
at
a
distance
it
was
the
time
of
year
to
look
after
corn
and
cotton
she
must
attend
to
her
house
and
her
slaves
the
remembrance
of
that
news
of
battle
and
of
the
three
deaths
that
had
left
her
widowed
and
childless
had
faded
away
in
the
illness
it
had
brought
she
never
comprehended
her
loss
she
was
like
one
bewitched
into
indifference
she
remembered
something
of
her
youth
and
kept
a
simple
routine
of
daily
life
and
that
was
all
i
she
done
groaned
peter
again
o
lord
hab
mercy
on
ole
mis
the
on
ladies
island
was
steep
and
sandy
and
the
oarsman
watched
peter
help
the
strange
passenger
up
the
ascent
with
a
sense
of
blessed
relief
he
pushed
off
a
little
way
into
the
stream
for
better
at
the
top
of
the
bluff
was
a
rough
shed
built
for
shelter
and
peter
looked
about
him
eagerly
while
his
mistress
stood
expectant
and
imperious
in
the
shade
of
a
pride
of
india
tree
that
grew
among
the
and
pines
of
a
wild
thicket
he
was
wretched
with
a
sense
of
her
discomfort
though
she
gave
no
sign
of
it
he
had
learned
to
know
by
instinct
all
that
was
unspoken
in
the
old
times
she
would
have
found
four
oarsmen
waiting
with
a
cushioned
boat
at
the
ferry
she
would
have
found
a
or
a
carriage
ready
for
her
on
ladies
island
for
the
five
miles
journey
but
the
carriage
had
not
come
the
poor
old
man
recognized
her
displeasure
he
was
her
only
slave
left
if
she
did
but
know
it
fo
gord
sake
git
me
some
kin
of
a
cart
ole
mis
she
done
wake
up
and
mean
to

urged
peter
who

jus
now
like
dey

me
or
she
be
right
mad
shore
the
elderly
guardian
of
the
shed
who
was
also
of
the
old
hobbled
away
quickly
and
backed
out
a
steer
that
was
broken
to
harness
and
a
rickety
cart
their
owner
had
left
them
there
for
some
hours
and
had
crossed
the
ferry
to
beaufort
old
mistress
must
be
obeyed
and
they
looked
toward
her
beseechingly
where
she
was
waiting
deprecating
her
disapproval
of
this
poor
apology
for
a
conveyance
the
lady
long
since
had
ceased
to
concern
herself
with
the
outward
shapes
of
things
she
accepted
this
possibility
of
carrying
out
her
plans
and
they
lifted
her
light
figure
to
the
chair
in
the
cart
end
while
peter
mounted
before
her
with
all
a
coachman
dignity
he
once
had
his
ambitions
of
being
her
coachman
and
they
moved
slowly
away
through
the
deep
sand
my
gord
look
out
fo
us
now
said
peter
over
and
over
ole
mis
she

how

o

yo

how
yo

her
po
head
wid
dem
be
easy
to
ole
mis
but
as
peter
pleaded
in
the
love
and
sorrow
of
his
heart
the
lady
who
sat
behind
him
was
unconscious
of
any
cause
for
grief
some
sweet
vagaries
in
her
own
mind
were
matched
to
the
loveliness
of
the
day
all
her
childhood
spent
among
the
rustic
scenes
of
these
fertile
sea
islands
was
yielding
for
her
now
an
undefined
pleasantness
of
association
the
palmettos
stood
out
with
picturesque
clearness
against
the
great
level
fields
with
their
straight
furrows
running
out
of
sight
figures
of
men
and
women
followed
the
furrow
paths
slowly
here
were
men
and
horses
bending
to
the
ploughshare
and
there
women
and
children
sowed
with
steady
hand
the
rich
seed
of
their
crops
there
were
touches
of
color
in
the
head
kerchiefs
there
were
sounds
of
songs
as
the
people
worked
not
gay
songs
of
the
evening
but
some
repeated
line
of
a
hymn
to
steady
the
patient
feet
and
make
the
work
go
faster
the
unconscious
music
of
the
blacks
who
sing
as
the
beetle
drones
or
the
cricket
chirps
slowly
under
the
dry
grass
it
had
a
look
of
permanence
this
it
was
a
thing
to
paint
to
relate
itself
to
the
permanence
of
art
an
everlasting
duty
of
mankind
terrible
if
a
thing
of
force
and
compulsion
and
for
another
gain
but
the
birthright
of
the
children
of
adam
and
not
unrewarded
nor
unnatural
when
one
drew
by
it
one
own
life
from
the
earth
peter
glanced
through
the
furtively
this
way
and
that
what
would
his
mistress
say
to
the
cabins
that
were
scattered
all
about
the
fields
now
and
that
were
no
longer
put
together
in
the
long
lines
of
the
quarters
he
looked
down
a
deserted
lane
where
he
well
remembered
fifty
cabins
on
each
side
of
the
way
it
was
gay
there
of
a
summer
evening
the
old
times
had
not
been
without
their
pleasures
and
the
poor
old
man
heart
leaped
with
the
vague
delight
of
his
memories
he
had
never
been
on
the
block
he
was
born
and
bred
at
old
sydenham
he
had
been
trusted
in
house
and
field
i
done
like
dem
ole
times
de
best
ventures
peter
presently
to
his
unresponding
companion
dere
was
good
dem
times
i
say
i
like
de
ole
times
good
as
any
young
folks
may
be
a
change
me
he
was
growing
gray
in
the
face
with
apprehension
he
did
not
dare
to
disobey
the
beast
of
burden
was
carrying
them
toward
sydenham
step
by
step
and
he
dreaded
the
moment
of
arrival
he
was
like
a
mesmerized
creature
who
can
only
obey
the
force
of
a
directing
will
but
under
pretense
of
handling
the
steer
harness
he
got
stiffly
to
the
ground
to
look
at
his
mistress
he
could
not
turn
to
face
her
as
he
sat
in
the
cart
he
could
not
drive
any
longer
and
feel
her
there
behind
him
the
silence
was
too
great
it
was
a
relief
to
see
her
placid
face
and
to
see
even
a
more
youthful
look
in
its
worn
lines
she
had
been
a
very
beautiful
woman
in
her
young
days
and
a
solemn
awe
fell
upon
peter
tender
heart
lest
the
veil
might
be
lifting
from
her
hidden
past
and
there
alone
with
him
on
the
old
plantation
she
would
die
of
grief
and
pain
god
only
knew
what
might
happen
the
old
man
mounted
to
his
seat
and
again
they
plodded
on
peter
said
the
mistress
he
was
always
frightened
when
she
spoke
peter
we
must
hurry
i
was
late
in
starting
i
have
a
great
deal
to
do
urge
the
horses
yas
mis
yas
mis
and
peter
laughed
aloud
nervously
and
brandished
his
sassafras
switch
while
the
steer
hastened
a
little
they
had
come
almost
to
the
gates
who
are
these
the
stately
wayfarer
asked
once
as
they
met
some
persons
who
gazed
at
them
in
astonishment
i
dem
de
good
ladies
de
norf
what
come
down
to
show
de
cullud
folks
how
to
do
readin
answered
peter
bravely
it
do
look
kind
o
over
here
he
added
wistfully
half
to
himself
he
could
not
understand
even
now
how
oblivious
she
was
of
the
great
changes
on
helena
there
were
curious
eyes
watching
from
the
fields
and
here
by
the
roadside
an
aged
black
woman
came
to
her
cabin
door
lord
exclaimed
peter
what
kin
i
do
now
an
ole
sibyl
she
done
crazy
too
and

the
steer

against

and
she
pointed
to
the
field
and
chuckled
peter
felt
as
if
his
brain
were
turning
bless
de
lord
i
no
more
slave
said
old
sibyl
looking
up
with
impudent
scrutiny
at
her
old
mistress
impassive
face

i

glad

ole
mars
middleton
i
die
the
old
creature
poured
forth
the
one
story
of
her
great
joy
and
pride
she
had
told
it
a
thousand
times
it
had
happened
not
the
last
planting
but
many
plantings
ago
it
remained
clear
when
everything
else
was
confused
there
was
no
knowing
what
she
might
say
next
she
began
to
take
the
strange
steps
of
a
slow
dance
and
peter
urged
his
steer
forward
while
his
mistress
said
suddenly
sibyl
i
am
glad
you
are
doing
so
well
with
a
strange
irrelevancy
of
graciousness
it
was
in
the
old
days
before
the
war
that
sibyl
had
fallen
insensible
one
day
in
the
did
her
mistress
think
that
it
was
still
that
year
and
peter
mind
could
not
puzzle
out
this
awful
day
of
anxiety
they
turned
at
last
into
the
avenue
they
had
only
another
half
mile
to
go
and
here
in
the
place
where
the
lady
had
closest
association
her
memory
was
suddenly
revived
almost
to
clearness
she
began
to
hurry
peter
impatiently
it
was
a
mischance
that
she
had
not
been
met
at
the
ferry
she
was
going
to
see
to
putting
the
house
in
order
and
the
women
were
all
waiting
it
was
autumn
and
they
were
going
to
move
over
from
beaufort
it
was
spring
next
moment
and
she
had
to
talk
with
her
overseers
the
old
imperiousness
flashed
out
did
not
peter
know
that
his
master
was
kept
at
the
front
and
the
young
gentlemen
were
with
him
and
their
regiment
was
going
into
action
it
was
a
blessing
to
come
over
and
forget
it
all
but
peter
must
drive
drive
they
had
taken
no
care
of
the
avenue
how
the
trees
were
broken
in
the
storm
the
house
needed
they
were
going
to
move
the
next
day
but
one
and
nothing
was
ready
a
party
of
gentlemen
were
coming
from
charleston
in
the
morning
they
passed
the
turn
of
the
avenue
they
came
out
to
the
open
lawn
and
the
steer
stopped
and
began
to
browse
peter
shook
from
head
to
foot
he
climbed
down
by
the
wheel
and
turned
his
face
slowly
ole
mis
he
said
feebly
mis
she
was
looking
off
into
space
the
cart
jerked
as
it
moved
after
the
feeding
steer
the
mistress
of
sydenham
plantation
had
sought
her
home
in
vain
the
crumbled
fallen
chimneys
of
the
house
were
there
among
the
weeds
and
that
was
all
on
christmas
day
and
easter
day
many
an
old
man
and
woman
come
into
helena
church
who
are
not
seen
there
the
rest
of
the
year
there
are
not
a
few
recluses
in
the
parish
who
come
to
listen
to
their
teacher
and
to
the
familiar
prayers
read
with
touching
earnestness
and
simplicity
as
one
seldom
hears
the
prayers
read
anywhere
this
easter
morning
dawned
clear
and
bright
as
easter
morning
should
the
roses
and
lilies
were
put
in
their
places
there
was
no
touch
of
paid
hands
anywhere
and
the
fragrance
blew
softly
about
the
church
as
you
sat
in
your
pew
you
could
look
out
through
the
doors
and
see
the
drooping
branches
and
the
birds
as
they
sat
singing
on
the
gravestones
the
sad
faces
of
the
old
people
the
cheerful
faces
of
the
young
passed
by
up
the
aisle
one
figure
came
to
sit
alone
in
one
of
the
pews
to
bend
its
head
in
prayer
after
the
ancient
habit
peter
led
her
as
usual
to
the
doorway
and
helped
her
stumbling
himself
up
the
steps
and
many
eyes
filled
with
tears
as
his
mistress
went
to
her
place
even
the
tragic
moment
of
yesterday
was
lost
already
in
the
acquiescence
of
her
mind
as
the
calm
sea
shines
back
to
the
morning
sun
when
another
wreck
has
gone
down
the
town
poor
william
trimble
and
miss
rebecca
wright
were
driving
along
hampden
east
road
one
afternoon
in
early
spring
their
progress
was
slow
trimble
sorrel
horse
was
old
and
stiff
and
the
wheels
were
clogged
by
day
mud
the
frost
was
not
yet
out
of
the
ground
although
the
snow
was
nearly
gone
except
in
a
few
places
on
the
north
side
of
the
woods
or
where
it
had
drifted
all
winter
against
a
length
of
fence
there
must
be
a
good
deal
o
snow
to
the
of
us
yet
said
trimble
i
feel
it
in
the
air
is
more
than
the
we
ai
goin
to
have
real
nice
weather
till
the
snow
all
gone
i
heard
say
yesterday
that
there
was
good
sleddin
yet
all
up
through
parsley
responded
miss
wright
i
should
like
to
live
in
them
northern
places
my
cousin
ellen
husband
was
a
parsley
man
he
was
obliged
as
you
may
have
heard
to
go
up
north
to
his
second
wife
funeral
got
back
day
before
yesterday
was
about
miles
an
they
started
on
wheels
but
when
they
gone
nine
or
ten
miles
they
found
was
no
sort
o
use
an
left
their
wagon
an
took
a
sleigh
the
man
that
owned
it
charged
four
six
too
i
should
have
thought
he
would
they
told
him
they
was
goin
to
a
funeral
an
they
had
their
own
buffaloes
an
everything
well
i
expect
it
a
good
deal
harder
scratching
up
that
way
they
have
to
git
money
where
they
can
the
farms
is
very
poor
as
you
go
north
suggested
trimble
kindly
ai
none
too
rich
a
country
where
we
be
but
i
always
been
grateful
i
born
up
to
parsley
the
old
horse
plodded
along
and
the
sun
coming
out
from
the
heavy
spring
clouds
sent
a
sudden
shine
of
light
along
the
muddy
road
sister
wright
drew
her
large
veil
forward
over
the
high
brim
of
her
bonnet
she
was
not
used
to
driving
or
to
being
much
in
the
open
air
but
trimble
was
an
active
business
woman
and
looked
after
her
own
affairs
herself
in
all
weathers
the
late
trimble
had
left
her
a
good
farm
but
not
much
ready
money
and
it
was
often
said
that
she
was
better
off
in
the
end
than
if
he
had
lived
she
regretted
his
loss
deeply
however
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
speak
of
him
even
to
intimate
friends
without
emotion
and
nobody
had
ever
hinted
that
this
emotion
was
insincere
she
was
most
and
generous
and
in
her
limited
way
played
the
part
of
lady
bountiful
in
the
town
of
hampden
why
there
where
the
bray
girls
lives
ai
it
she
exclaimed
as
beyond
a
thicket
of
and
they
came
in
sight
of
a
solitary
farmhouse
the
barn
was
too
far
away
for
thrift
or
comfort
and
they
could
see
long
lines
of
light
between
the
shrunken
boards
as
they
came
nearer
the
fields
looked
both
stony
and
sodden
somehow
even
parsley
itself
could
be
hardly
more
forlorn
yes
said
miss
wright
that
where
they
live
now
poor
things
i
know
the
place
though
i
ai
been
up
here
for
years

the
girls

to
meetin
all

covetin
why

rebecca

answered
trimble
heartily

to
remain
over
night
long
o

so

in
the
habit
o
sendin
a
basket
to
the
bray
girls
when
any
o
our
folks
is
comin
this
way
but
i
ai
been
to
see
since
they
moved
up
here
why
it
must
be
a
good
deal
over
a
year
ago
i
know
was
in
the
late
winter
they
had
to
make
the
move
was
cruel
hard
i
must
say
an
if
i
had
been
down
with
my
pleurisy
fever
i
have
stirred
round
an
done
about
it
there
was
a
good
deal
o
sickness
at
the
time
an
well
was
kind
o
rushed
through
breakin
of
up
an
lots
o
folks
blamed
the
but
whe
was
done
was
done
an
nobody
took
holt
to
undo
it
ann
an
mandy
looked
same
ever
when
they
come
to
meetin
in
the
summer
kind
o
wishful
perhaps
always
sent
me
word
they
was
gittin
on
pretty
comfortable
that
would
be
their
way
said
rebecca
wright
they
never
was
any
hand
to
complain
though
mandy
less
cheerful
than
ann
if
mandy
been
spared
such
poor
eyesight
an
ann
had
got
her
lame
wrist
that
set
right
they
kep
off
the
town
fast
enough
they
both
shed
tears
when
they
talked
to
me
about
havin
to
break
up
when
i
went
to
see
before
i
went
over
to
brother
asa
you
see
we
was
brought
up
neighbors
an
we
went
to
school
together
the
brays
an
me
was
a
special
providence
brought
us
home
this
road
i
been
so
covetin
a
chance
to
git
to
see
my
lameness
hampers
me
i
glad
we
come
this
way
myself
said
trimble
i
like
to
see
just
how
they
fare
miss
rebecca
wright
continued
they
give
their
consent
to
goin
on
the
town
because
they
knew
got
to
be
dependent
an
so
they
felt
would
come
easier
for
all
than
for
a
few
to
help
they
acted
real
dignified
contrary
to
what
most
do
in
such
cases
but
they
was
dreadful
anxious
to
see
who
would
bid
off
day
they
did
so
hope
would
be
somebody
right
in
the
village
i
just
sat
down
an
cried
good
when
i
found
abel
janes
folks
had
got
hold
of
they
always
had
the
name
of
bein
slack
an
an
they
did
it
just
for
what
they
got
out
o
the
town
the
selectmen
this
last
year
ai
what
we
have
had
i
hope
they
been
considerate
about
the
bray
girls
i
should
have
more
considerate
about
fetchin
of
you
over
apologized
trimble
i
got
my
horse
an
you
is
too
far
for
you
to
come
but
time
does
slip
away
with
busy
folks
an
i
forgit
a
good
deal
i
ought
to
remember
there
nobody
more
considerate
than
you
be
protested
miss
rebecca
wright
trimble
made
no
answer
but
took
out
her
whip
and
gently
touched
the
sorrel
horse
who
walked
considerably
faster
but
did
not
think
it
worth
while
to
trot
it
was
a
long
way
to
the
house
farther
down
the
road
and
up
a
lane
i
never
had
any
opinion
of
the
bray
girls
father
leavin
as
he
did
said
trimble
he
was
much
praised
in
his
time
though
there
was
always
some
said
his
early
life
had
been
up
to
the
mark
explained
her
companion
he
was
a
great
favorite
of
our
then
preacher
the
reverend
daniel
longbrother
they
did
a
good
deal
for
the
parish
but
they
did
it
their
own
way
deacon
bray
was
one
that
did
his
part
in
the
repairs
without
urging
you
know
was
in
his
time
the
first
repairs
was
made
when
they
got
out
the
old
an

handsome
square
pews
it
cost
an
awful
sight
o
money
too
they
had
done
payin
up
that
debt
when
they
set
to
alter
it
again
an
git
the
walls
frescoed
my
grandmother
was
one
that
always
spoke
her
mind
right
out
an
she
was
dreadful
opposed
to
breakin
up
the
square
pews
where
she
always
set
they
was
countin
up
what
would
cost
in
parish
meetin
an
she
riz
right
up
an
said
would
cost
nothin
to
let
stay
an
there
a
house
carpenter
left
in
the
parish
that
could
do
such
nice
work
an
time
would
come
when
the
would
give
their
to
have
the
old
look
just
as
it
did
then
but
haul
the
inside
to
pieces
they
would
and
did
there
come
to
be
a
real
fight
over
it
did
there
agreed
trimble
soothingly
well
good
taste
i
remember
the
old
house
well
i
come
here
as
a
child
to
visit
a
cousin
o
mother
an
trimble
folks
was
neighbors
an
we
was
drawed
to
each
other
then
young
we
was
trimble
spoke
of
it
many
the
time
that
first
time
he
ever
see
me
in
a
leghorn
hat
with
a
feather
was
one
that
mother
had
an
pressed
over
when
i
think
of
them
old
sermons
that
used
to
be
preached
in
that
old
of
all
i
glad
it
altered
over
so
not
to
remind
folks
said
miss
rebecca
wright
after
a
suitable
pause
them
old
brimstone
discourses
you
know
mis
trimble
preachers
is
far
more
reasonable
nowadays
why
i
set
an
thought
last
sabbath
as
i
listened
that
if
old
longbrother
an
deacon
bray
could
hear
the
difference
they
crack
the
ground
over
like
pole
beans
an
come
right
up
side
their
headstones
trimble
laughed
heartily
and
shook
the
reins
three
or
four
times
by
way
of
emphasis
there
no
gitting
round
you
she
said
much
pleased
i
should
think
deacon
bray
would
want
to
rise
any
way
if
was
so
he
could
an
knew
how
his
poor
girls
was
farin
a
man
ought
to
provide
for
his
folks
he
got
to
leave
behind
him
specially
if
they
women
to
be
sure
they
had
their
little
home
but
seen
how
with
all
their
industrious
ways
they
had
means
to
keep
it
i
he
thought
he
got
time
enough
to
lay
by
when
he
give
so
generous
in
collections
but
he
did
lay
by
an
there
they
be
he
might
have
took
lessons
from
the
squirrels
even
them
little
wild
creator
makes
them
their
winter
hoards
an
ought
to
know
enough
if
squirrels
does
just
before
you
are
generous
what
was
always
set
for
the
b
in
the
when
i
was
to
school
and
it
often
runs
through
my
mind
for
man
his
days
are
as
grass
that
was
for
a
the
two
go
well
together
added
miss
rebecca
wright
soberly
my
good
gracious
this
a
place
it
makes
me
ache
to
think
them
nice
bray
girls
has
to
brook
it
here
the
sorrel
horse
though
somewhat
puzzled
by
an
unexpected
deviation
from
his
homeward
way
willingly
came
to
a
stand
by
the
gnawed
corner
of
the
fence
which
evidently
served
as
two
or
three
ragged
old
hens
were
picking
about
the
yard
and
at
last
a
face
appeared
at
the
kitchen
window
tied
up
in
a
handkerchief
as
if
it
were
a
case
of
toothache
by
the
time
our
friends
reached
the
side
door
next
this
window
janes
came
disconsolately
to
open
it
for
them
shutting
it
again
as
soon
as
possible
though
the
air
felt
more
chilly
inside
the
house
take
seats
said
janes
briefly
you
have
to
see
me
just
as
i
be
i
have
been
suffering
these
four
days
with
the
ague

everything

inconvenient
to
spare
him
i
should
be
pleased
to
have
you
lay
off
your
things
comfortable
trimble
looked
about
the
cheerless
kitchen
and
could
not
think
of
anything
to
say
so
she
smiled
blandly
and
shook
her
head
in
answer
to
the
invitation
we
just
set
a
few
minutes
with
you
to
pass
the
time
o
day
an
then
we
must
go

close
to
the
stove

back
some
time
in
the
fall

miss
rebecca
with
an
undue
sense
of
guilt
and
conviction

the
east
parish
an
thought
we
stop

road

mis
trimble
but
ai
so
easy
for
me
as
is
for
you
with
all
your
means
to
do
with
the
poor
woman
looked
pinched
and
miserable
herself
though
it
was
evident
that
she
had
no
gift
at
house
or
home
keeping
heart
was
wrung
with
pain
as
she
thought
of
the
unwelcome
inmates
of
such
a
place
but
she
held
her
peace
bravely
while
miss
rebecca
again
gave
some
brief
information
in
regard
to
the
installation
you
go
right
up
them
back
stairs
the
hostess
directed
at
last
glad
some
o
you
church
folks
has
seen
fit
to
come
an
visit
there
ai
been
nobody
here
this
long
spell
an
they
aged
a
sight
since
they
come
they
always
send
down
a
taste
out
of
your
baskets
mis
trimble
an
i
relish
it
i
tell
you
i
shut
the
door
after
you
if
you
do
object
i
feel
every
draught
o
cold
air
i
always
heard
she
was
a
great
hand
to
make
a
poor
mouth
she
from
somewheres
up
parsley
way
whispered
miss
rebecca
as
they
stumbled
in
the
poor
meechin
body
wherever
she
come
from
replied
trimble
as
she
knocked
at
the
door
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
after
this
unusual
sound
then
one
of
the
bray
sisters
opened
the
door
the
eager
guests
stared
into
a
small
low
room
brown
with
age
and
gray
too
as
if
former
dust
and
cobwebs
could
not
be
made
wholly
to
disappear
the
two
elderly
women
who
stood
there
looked
like
captives
their
withered
faces
wore
a
look
of
apprehension
and
the
room
itself
was
more
bare
and
plain
than
was
fitting
to
their
evident
refinement
of
character
and
there
was
an
uncovered
small
table
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
with
some
crackers
on
a
plate
and
for
some
reason
or
other
this
added
a
great
deal
to
the
general
desolation
but
miss
ann
bray
the
elder
sister
who
carried
her
right
arm
in
a
sling
with
piteously
drooping
fingers
gazed
at
the
visitors
with
radiant
joy
she
had
not
seen
them
arrive
the
one
window
gave
only
the
view
at
the
back
of
the
house
across
the
fields
and
their
coming
was
indeed
a
surprise
the
next
minute
she
was
laughing
and
crying
together
oh
sister
she
said
if
here
ai
our
dear
mis
trimble
an
my
heart
o
goodness
is
wright
too
what
dear
good
creatur
you
be
i
felt
all
day
as
if
something
good
was
goin
to
happen
an
was
just
sayin
to
myself
was
most
sundown
now
but
i
would
let
on
to
mandany
i
give
up
hope
quite
yet
you
see
the
scissors
stuck
in
the
floor
this
very
mornin
an
it
always
a
reliable
sign
there
i
got
to
kiss
ye
both
again
i
do
know
where
we
can
all
set
lamented
sister
mandana
there
ai
but
the
one
chair
an
the
bed
t
other
chair
too
rickety
we
been
promised
another
these
ten
days
but
first
they
forgot
it
an
next
mis
janes
ca
spare
it
one
excuse
an
another
i
am
goin
to
git
a
stump
o
wood
an
nail
a
board
on
to
it
when
i
can
git
outdoor
again
said
mandana
in
a
plaintive
voice
there
i
goin
to
complain
o
nothin
now
you
come
she
added
and
the
guests
sat
down
trimble
as
was
proper
in
the
one
chair
we
sat
on
the
bed
many
the
time
with
you
an
talked
over
our
girl
nonsense
ai
we
you
know
where
was
in
the
little
back
bedroom
we
had
when
we
was
girls
an
used
to
peek
out
at
our
beaux
through
the
strings
o
laughed
ann
bray
delightedly
her
thin
face
shining
more
and
more
with
joy
i
brought
some
o
them
seeds
along
when
we
come
away
we
raised
so
many
years
an
we
got
started
all
right
but
the
hens
found
out
i
declare
i
chased
them
poor
hens
foolish
as
was
but
the
i
counted
on
a
sight
to
remind
me
o
home
you
see
our
debts
was
so
large
after
my
long
sickness
an
all
that
we
did
feel
was
right
to
keep
back
anything
we
could
help
from
the
auction
it
was
impossible
for
any
one
to
speak
for
a
moment
or
two
the
sisters
felt
their
own
uprooted
condition
afresh
and
their
guests
for
the
first
time
really
comprehended
the
piteous
contrast
between
that
neat
little
village
house
which
now
seemed
a
palace
of
comfort
and
this
cold
unpainted
upper
room
in
the
remote
janes
farmhouse
it
was
an
unwelcome
thought
to
trimble
that
the
town
of
hampden
could
provide
no
better
for
its
poor
than
this
and
her
round
face
flushed
with
resentment
and
the
shame
of
personal
responsibility
the
girls
shall
be
well
settled
in
the
village
before
another
winter
if
i
pay
their
board
myself
she
made
an
inward
resolution
and
took
another
almost
tearful
look
at
the
broken
stove
the
miserable
bed
and
the
sisters
one
trunk
on
which
mandana
was
sitting
but
the
poor
place
was
filled
with
a
golden
spirit
of
hospitality
rebecca
was
again
discoursing
eloquently
of
the
installation
it
was
so
much
easier
to
speak
of
general
subjects
and
the
sisters
had
evidently
been
longing
to
hear
some
news
since
the
late
summer
they
had
not
been
to
church
and
presently
trimble
asked
the
reason
now
do
you
go
to
pouring
out
our
woes
mandy
begged
little
old
ann
looking
shy
and
almost
girlish
and
as
if
she
insisted
upon
playing
that
life
was
still
all
before
them
and
all
pleasure
you
go
to
spoilin
their
visit
with
our
complaints
they
know
we
do
that
changes
must
come
an
we
been
so
wonted
to
our
home
things
that
this
come
hard
at
first
but
then
they
felt
for
us
i
know
just
as
well
can
be
will
soon
be
summer
again
an
is
real
pleasant
right
out
in
the
fields
here
when
there
ai
too
hot
a
spell
i
got
to
know
a
sight
o
singin
birds
since
we
come
give
me
the
folks
i
always
known
sighed
the
younger
sister
who
looked
older
than
miss
ann
and
less
you
may
have
your
birds
if
you
want
i
do
long
to
go
to
meetin
an
see
folks
go
by
up
the
aisle
now
i
will
speak
of
it
ann
whatever
you
say
we
need
each
of
us
a
pair
o
good
stout
shoes
rubbers
ours
are
all
wore
out
an
we
asked
an
asked
an
they
never
think
to
bring
an
poor
old
mandana
on
the
trunk
covered
her
face
with
her
arms
and
sobbed
aloud
the
elder
sister
stood
over
her
and
patted
her
on
the
thin
shoulder
like
a
child
and
tried
to
comfort
her
it
crossed
trimble
mind
that
it
was
not
the
first
time
one
had
wept
and
the
other
had
comforted
the
sad
scene
must
have
been
repeated
many
times
in
that
long
drear
winter
she
would
see
them
forever
after
in
her
mind
as
fixed
as
a
picture
and
her
own
tears
fell
fast
you
did
see
mis
janes
cunning
little
boy
the
next
one
to
the
baby
did
you
asked
ann
bray
turning
round
quickly
at
last
and
going
cheerfully
on
with
the
conversation
now
hush
mandy
dear
they
think
you
childish
he
a
dear
friendly
little
creatur
an
likes
to
stay
with
us
a
good
deal
though
we
feel
if
it
was
too
cold
for
him
now
we
are
waitin
to
get
us
more
wood
when
i
think
of
the
acres
o
woodland
in
this
town
groaned
rebecca
wright
i
believe
i
goin
to
preach
next
sunday
o
the
minister
an
i
make
the
sparks
fly
i
always
heard
the
saying
everybody
business
is
nobody
business
an
i
come
to
believe
it
now
do
you
you
happened
on
a
kind
of
a
poor
time
with
us
but
we
got
more
belongings
than
you
see
here
an
a
good
large
cluset
where
we
can
store
those
things
there
ai
room
to
have
about
you
an
miss
trimble
have
happened
on
a
kind
of
poor
day
you
know
soon
i
git
me
some
stout
shoes
an
rubbers
as
mandy
says
i
can
fetch
home
plenty
o
little
dry
boughs
o
pine
you
remember
i
was
always
a
great
hand
to
roam
in
the
woods
if
we
could
only
have
a
front
room
so
we
could
look
out
on
the
road
an
see
passin
was
shod
for
meetin
i
don
know
we
should
complain
now
we
just
goin
to
give
you
what
we
got
an
make
out
with
a
good
welcome
we
make
more
tea
we
want
in
the
mornin
an
then
let
the
fire
go
down
since
has
been
so
mild
we
got
a
cluset
disappearing
as
she
spoke
an
i
know
this
to
be
good
tea
it
some
o
yourn
mis
trimble
an
here
our
sprigged
chiny
cups
that
knows
by
sight
if
mis
trimble
do
we
kep
out
four
of
an
put
the
even
half
dozen
with
the
rest
of
the
auction
stuff
i
often
wondered
who
got
but
i
never
asked
for
fear
would
be
somebody
that
would
distress
us
they
was
mother
you
know
the
four
cups
were
poured
and
the
little
table
pushed
to
the
bed
where
rebecca
wright
still
sat
and
mandana
wiping
her
eyes
came
and
joined
her
trimble
sat
in
her
chair
at
the
end
and
ann
trotted
about
the
room
in
pleased
content
for
a
while
and
in
and
out
of
the
closet
as
if
she
still
had
much
to
do
then
she
came
and
stood
opposite
trimble
she
was
very
short
and
small
and
there
was
no
painful
sense
of
her
being
obliged
to
stand
the
four
cups
were
not
quite
full
of
cold
tea
but
there
was
a
clean
old
tablecloth
folded
double
and
a
plate
with
three
pairs
of
crackers
neatly
piled
and
a
small
it
must
be
owned
a
very
small
piece
of
hard
white
cheese
then
for
a
treat
in
a
glass
dish
there
was
a
little
preserved
peach
the
last
miss
rebecca
knew
it
instinctively
of
the
household
stores
brought
from
their
old
home
it
was
very
sugary
this
bit
of
peach
and
as
she
helped
her
guests
and
sister
mandy
miss
ann
bray
said
half
unconsciously
as
she
often
had
said
with
less
reason
in
the
old
days
our
preserves
ai
so
good
as
usual
this
year
this
is
beginning
to
candy
both
the
guests
protested
while
rebecca
added
that
the
taste
of
it
carried
her
back
and
made
her
feel
young
again
the
brays
had
always
managed
to
keep
one
or
two
alive
in
their
corner
of
a
garden
i
been
keeping
this
preserve
for
a
treat
said
her
friend
i
glad
to
have
you
eat
some
last
summer
i
often
wished
you
was
home
an
could
come
an
see
us
o
being
away
off
to
plainfields
the
crackers
did
not
taste
too
dry
miss
ann
took
the
last
of
the
peach
on
her
own
cracker
there
could
not
have
been
quite
a
small
spoonful
after
the
others
were
helped
but
she
asked
them
first
if
they
would
not
have
some
more
then
there
was
a
silence
and
in
the
silence
a
wave
of
tender
feeling
rose
high
in
the
hearts
of
the
four
elderly
women
at
this
moment
the
setting
sun
flooded
the
poor
plain
room
with
light
the
unpainted
wood
was
all
of
a
and
ann
bray
with
her
gray
hair
and
aged
face
stood
at
the
head
of
the
table
in
a
kind
of
aureole
trimble
face
was
all
aquiver
as
she
looked
at
her
she
thought
of
the
text
about
two
or
three
being
gathered
together
and
was
half
afraid
i
believe
we
ought
to
asked
mis
janes
if
she
would
come
up
said
ann
she
real
good
feelin
but
she
had
it
very
hard
gits
discouraged
i
ca
find
that
she
ever
had
anything
real
pleasant
to
look
back
to
as
we
have
there
next
time
we
make
a
good
heartenin
time
for
her
too
the
sorrel
horse
had
taken
a
long
nap
by
the
gnawed
and
the
cool
air
after
sundown
made
him
impatient
to
be
gone
the
two
friends
jolted
homeward
in
the
gathering
darkness
through
the
stiffening
mud
and
neither
trimble
nor
rebecca
wright
said
a
word
until
they
were
out
of
sight
as
well
as
out
of
sound
of
the
janes
house
time
must
elapse
before
they
could
reach
a
more
familiar
part
of
the
road
and
resume
conversation
on
its
natural
level
i
consider
myself
to
blame
insisted
trimble
at
last
i
have
no
words
of
accusation
for
nobody
else
an
i
ai
one
to
take
comfort
in
calling
names
to
the
board

the
water
comin
back
through
you
i
do
care
what
she
says
dear
creatur
exclaimed
trimble
i
full
o
regrets
i
took
time
for
that
installation
an
set
there
seepin
in
a
lot
o
talk
this
whole
day
long
except
for
its
kind
of
bringin
us
to
the
bray
girls
i
wish
to
my
heart
was
mornin
an
i
for
the
the
quest
of
teaby
the
trees
were
bare
on
meadow
and
hill
and
all
about
the
country
one
saw
the
warm
brown
of
lately
fallen
leaves
there
was
still
a
cheerful
bravery
of
green
in
sheltered
places
a
fine
live
green
that
flattered
the
eye
with
its
look
of
permanence
the
first
three
quarters
of
the
year
seemed
to
have
worked
out
their
slow
processes
to
make
this
perfect
day
in
such
weather
i
found
even
the
east
wilby
railroad
station
attractive
and
waiting
three
hours
for
a
slow
train
became
a
pleasure
the
delight
of
idleness
and
even
booklessness
can
not
be
properly
described
the
interior
of
the
station
was
bleak
and
gravelly
but
it
would
have
been
possible
to
find
fault
with
any
interior
on
such
an
day
and
after
the
had
locked
his
door
and
tried
the
handle
twice
with
a
comprehensive
look
at
me
he
went
slowly
away
up
the
road
to
spend
some
leisure
time
with
his
family
he
had
ceased
to
take
any
interest
in
the
traveling
public
and
answered
my
questions
as
briefly
as
possible
after
he
had
gone
some
distance
he
turned
to
look
back
but
finding
that
i
still
sat
on
the
baggage
truck
in
the
sunshine
just
where
he
left
me
he
smothered
his
natural
apprehensions
and
went
on
one
might
spend
a
good
half
hour
in
watching
crows
as
they
go
southward
resolutely
through
the
clear
sky
and
then
waver
and
come
straggling
back
as
if
they
had
forgotten
something
one
might
think
over
all
one
immediate
affairs
and
learn
to
know
the
outward
aspect
of
such
a
place
as
east
wilby
as
if
born
and
brought
up
there
but
after
a
while
i
lost
interest
in
both
past
and
future
there
was
too
much
landscape
before
me
at
the
moment
and
a
lack
of
figures
the
weather
was
not
to
be
enjoyed
merely
as
an
end
yet
there
was
no
temptation
to
explore
the
road
on
the
left
or
the
level
fields
on
the
right
i
sat
still
on
my
baggage
truck
and
waited
for
something
to
happen
sometimes
one
is
so
happy
that
there
is
nothing
left
to
wish
for
but
to
be
happier
and
just
as
the
remembrance
of
this
truth
illuminated
my
mind
i
saw
two
persons
approaching
from
opposite
directions
the
first
to
arrive
was
a
elderly
countrywoman
well
wrapped
in
a
worn
winter
cloak
with
a
thick
plaid
shawl
over
it
and
a
white
worsted
cloud
tied
over
her
bonnet
she
carried
a
bandbox
the
outlines
were
perfect
under
its
checked
gingham
cover
and
had
a
large
bundle
beside
securely
rolled
in
a
newspaper
from
her
dress
i
felt
sure
that
she
had
made
a
mistake
in
dates
and
expected
winter
to
set
in
at
once
her
face
was
crimson
with
undue
warmth
and
what
appeared
in
the
end
to
have
been
unnecessary
haste
she
did
not
take
any
notice
of
the
elderly
man
who
reached
the
platform
a
minute
later
until
they
were
near
enough
to
take
each
other
by
the
hand
and
exchange
most
cordial
greetings
well
this
is
a
treat
said
the
man
who
was
a
small
and
person
he
carried
a
great
umbrella
and
a
thin
valise
and
wore
an
ancient
little
silk
hat
and
a
nearly
new
greenish
linen
duster
as
if
it
were
yet
summer
i
was
full
o
thinkin
o
you
day
before
yisterday
strange
it
he
announced
impressively
in
a
plaintive
voice
i
was
sayin
to
myself
if
there
was
one
livin
bein
i
coveted
to
encounter
over
east
wilby
way
was
you
sister
pinkham
warm
ai
it
responded
sister
pinkham
how
your
health
teaby
i
guess
i
better
set
right
down
here
on
the
aidge
of
the
platform
we
git
more
air
than
if
we
went
inside
the
depot
it
necessary
to
git
my
breath
before
i
rise
the
hill
you
ca
seem
to
account
for
them
foresights
continued
teaby
putting
down
his
tall
thin
valise
and
letting
the
empty
top
of
it
fold
over
then
he
stood
his
umbrella
against
the
end
of
my
baggage
truck
without
a
glance
at
me
i
was
glad
that
they
were
not
finding
me
in
their
way
well
if
this
ai
very
i
never
saw
nothin
that
was
repeated
the
little
man
nobody
can
set
forth
to
explain
why
the
thought
of
you
should
have
been
so
borne
in
upon
me
day
before
yisterday
your
livin
countenance
an
all
an
here
we
be
today
settin
side
o
one
another
i
come
to
rely
on
them
foresights
they
been
of
use
in
my
business
too
trade
good
as
common
this
fall
inquired
sister
pinkham
languidly
you
do
carry
such
a
thing
as
a
good
fan
your
stuff
i
expect
it
does
appear
to
me
as
if
i
had
been
more
het
up
any
day
this
year
i
should
ha
had
the
observation
to
offer
it
before
said
teaby
with
pride
yes
sister
pinkham
i
got
an
excellent
fan
right
here
an
you
shall
have
it
he
reached
for
his
bag
i
heard
a
clink
as
if
there
were
bottles
within
presently
his
companion
began
to
fan
herself
with
that
steady
sway
and
lop
of
the
which
one
sees
only
in
country
churches
in
midsummer
weather
teaby
edged
away
a
little
as
if
he
feared
such
a
steady
we
might
ha
picked
out
a
shadier
spot
on
your
account
he
suggested
ca
you
unpin
your
shawl
not
while
i
so
het
answered
sister
pinkham
coldly
is
there
anything
new
recommended
for
rheumatic
complaints
they
gittin
up
new
compounds
right
straight
along
and
sends
sights
o
printed
bills
urgin
of
me
to
buy
i
do
beseech
none
o
my
customers
to
take
them
strange
nostrums
that
i
ai
able
to
recommend
some
is
new
cotches
made
o
the
good
old
i
expect
said
sister
and
there
was
a
comfortable
silence
of
some
minutes
i
kind
of
surprised
to
meet
with
you
when
all
said
done
it
kind
of
started
me
when
i
see
was
you
after
dwellin
on
you
so
day
before
yisterday
insisted
teaby
and
this
time
sister
pinkham
took
heed
of
the
interesting
coincidence
thinkin
o
me
was
you
and
she
stopped
the
fan
a
moment
and
turned
to
look
at
him
with
interest
i
was
so
well
i
never
see
nobody
that
kep
her
looks
as
you
do
and
a
sufferer
too
as
one
may
express
it
sister
pinkham
sighed
heavily
and
began
to
ply
the
fan
again
you
was
sayin
just
now
that
you
found
them
foresight
notions
work
into
your
business
yes
i
saved
a
life
this
last
spring
i
was
puttin
up
my
vials
to
start
out
over
briggsville
way
an
was
impressed
upon
me
that
i
better
carry
a
portion
o
opodildack
i
was
loaded
up
heavy
had
all
i
could
lug
of
spring
goods
salts
an
seny
and
them
spring
bitters
o
mine
that
folks
counts
on
regular
i
could
git
the
opodildack
out
o
my
mind
noway
and
i
did
want
it
for
nothin
nor
nobody
but
i
had
to
remove
a
needed
vial
o
some
kind
of
essence
to
give
it
place
when
i
was
goin
down
the
lane
abel
dean
house
his
women
folks
come
flyin
out
in
here
says
they
down
the
sullar
stairs
they
was
like
crazy
creatur
i
give
the
vial
right
there
in
the
lane
an
they
run
in
an
i
followed
last
time
i
was
there
the
child
was
out
looked
rugged
and
hearty
they
never
forgot
it
never
will
said
teaby
impressively
with
a
pensive
look
toward
the
horizon
want
me
to
stop
over
night
with
any
time
or
come
an
take
the
hoss
or
anything
mis
dean
she
buys
four
times
the
essences
an
stuff
she
wants
kind
o
gratified
you
see
an
want
to
lose
the
child
i
expect
though
she
got
a
number
o
others
if
it
had
for
its
bein
so
impressed
on
my
mind
i
should
have
omitted
that
opodildack
i
deem
it
a
winter
remedy
chiefly
perhaps
the
young
one
would
ha
come
to
without
none
they
do
survive
right
through
everything
an
then
again
they
seem
to
be
taken
away
right
in
their
tracks
sister
pinkham
grew
more
talkative
as
she
cooled
heard
any
news
as
you
come
along
some
vaguely
responded
teaby
folks
ginerally
relates
that
occurred
since
they
see
me
before
i
ai
no
great
hand
for
news
an
never
was
pity
uncle
teaby
there
anybody
do
like
to
have
deaths
occur
an
them
things
and
be
unawares
of
an
the
last
to
know
when
folks
calls
in
sister
pinkham
laughed
at
first
but
said
her
say
with
spirit
certain
certain
we
ought
all
of
us
to
show
an
interest
i
did
hear
it
reported
that
elder
fry
calculates
to
give
up
preachin
an
go
into
the
creamery
business
another
spring
you
know
he
had
means
left
him
and
his
throat
kind
o
give
out
trouble
with
the
pipes
i
called
it
brown
caters
an
explained
nigh
as
i
could
without
of
his
pride
that
he
bawled
more
any
pipes
could
stand
i
git
so
wore
out
settin
under
him
that
i
feel
to
go
an
lay
right
out
in
the
woods
arterwards
where
it
still
wo
never
do
for
him
to
deal
so
with
callin
of
his
cows
they
be
so
aggravated
would
be
more
any
butter
business
could
bear
you
had
ought
to
speak
so
light
now
he
a
very
feelin
man
towards
any
one
in
trouble
sister
pinkham
rebuked
the
speaker
i
set
by
elder
fry
you
sort
o
divert
yourself
dallying
round
the
country
with
your
essences
and
remedies
an
you
ai
never
sagged
down
with
no
settled
grievance
as
most
do
think
o
what
the
elder
through
o
three
good
wives
i
one
o
them
that
ai
found
life
come
none
too
easy
an
elder
fry
stayed
my
mind
i
you
right
if
you
think
you
be
acknowledged
the
little
man
humbly
i
ca
say
as
i
esteem
myself
so
fortunate
as
most
i
a
lonesome
creatur
an
always
was
you
know
i
be
i
did
expect
somebody
engage
my
affections
before
this
there
plenty
be
glad
to
have
ye
i
expect
they
would
but
i
do
seem
to
be
drawed
to
none
on
replied
teaby
with
a
mournful
shake
of
his
head
i
spoke
pretty
decided
to
quite
a
number
in
my
time
take
all
together
but
it
always
appeared
best
not
to
follow
it
up
an
so
when
i
come
their
way
again
i
laugh
it
off
or
somethin
in
case
was
referred
to
i
see
one
now
an
then
that
i
kind
o
fancy
but
ai
the
real
thing
you
must
expect
to
pick
out
a
handsome
gal
at
your
age
insisted
sister
pinkham
in
a
way
time
past
for
all
that
you
got
the
name
of
a
rover
i
heard
some
say
that
you
was
rich
but
that
ai
every
thin
you
must
take
who
you
can
git
and
look
you
up
a
good
home
i
would
if
you
was
to
be
taken
down
with
any
settled
complaint
you
be
distressed
to
be
without
a
place
o
your
own

means
to

good
long

my
oldest
sister
daughter
i
kind
of
call
it
home
with
her
by
spells
and
when
the
travelin
bad
good
king
agrippy
if
that
the
best
you
can
do
i
feel
for
you
exclaimed
the
energetic
adviser
she
a
harmless
creatur
and
seems
to
keep
ploddin
but
slack
ai
no
description
an
runs
on
about
nothin
till
it
strikes
right
in
an
numbs
ye
she
pressed
for
house
room
too
hart
ought
to
put
on
an
addition
long
ago
but
too
stingy
to
live
folks
was
tellin
me
that
somebody
observed
to
him
how
he
got
a
real
good
stiddy
man
to
work
with
him
this
summer
called
a
very
pious
man
too
great
hand
in
meetin
hart
says
they
an
says
he
have
you
he
out
my
time
said
it
hasty
too
as
if
he
meant
it
well
i
can
put
up
with
hart
he
near
but
he
uses
me
well
an
i
try
to
do
the
same
by
him
i
do
bange
on
i
pay
my
way
an
i
feel
as
if
everything
was
i
did
plan
to
go
way
over
north
dexter
way
where
i
never
an
see
if
there
somebody
but
the
weather
ai
settled
as
i
could
wish
i
always
expectin
to
find
her
i
be
so
at
which
i
observed
sister
frame
shake
i
felt
a
slight
reproach
of
conscience
at
listening
so
intently
to
these
entirely
private
affairs
and
at
this
point
reluctantly
left
my
place
and
walked
along
the
platform
to
remind
sister
pinkham
and
confiding
teaby
of
my
neighborhood
they
gave
no
sign
that
there
was
any
objection
to
the
presence
of
a
stranger
and
so
i
came
back
gladly
to
the
baggage
truck
and
we
all
kept
silence
for
a
little
while
a
fine
flavor
of
extracts
was
wafted
from
the
valise
to
where
i
sat
i
pictured
to
myself
the
solitary
and
hopeful
wanderings
of
teaby
there
was
an
air
about
him
of
some
distinction
he
might
have
been
a
decayed
member
of
the
medical
profession
i
observed
that
his
hands
were
unhardened
by
any
sort
of
rural
work
and
he
sat
there
a
meek
and
appealing
figure
with
his
antique
hat
and
linen
duster
beside
the
round
shoulders
of
friendly
sister
pinkham
the
expression
of
their
backs
was
most
interesting
you
might
express
it
that
i
got
quite
a
number
o
good
homes
got
me
sorted
out
a
few
regular
places
where
i
mostly
stop
teaby
explained
presently
i
like
to
visit
with
the
old
folks
an
speak
the
past
together
an
the
boys
an
gals
they
always
have
some
kind
o
fun
goin
on
when
i
git
along
they
always
have
to
git
me
out
to
the
barn
an
tell
me
if
they
and
i
fetch
an
carry
for
in
that
case
an
help
out
all
i
can
i
made
peace
when
they
got
into
some
o
their
misunderstanding
an
them
times
they
set
a
good
deal
by
uncle
teaby
but
they
ai
all
got
along
as
well
as
they
expected
and
that
one
thing
that
made
me
desirous
not
to
git
fooled
myself
but
i
do
know
as
folks
would
be
reconciled
to
my
settlin
down
in
one
place
i
gathered
a
good
many
extry
receipts
for
things
an
folks
all
calls
me
somethin
of
a
doctor
you
know
my
was
one
on
my
mother
side
well
you
had
my
counsel
for
what
is
wuth
said
the
woman
not
unkindly
trouble
is
you
want
better
bread
than
made
o
wheat
i
ashamed
to
ask
ye
again
if
would
be
any
use
to
lay
the
matter
before
hannah
jane
pinkham
this
was
spoken
lower
but
i
could
hear
the
gentle
suggestion
i
obleeged
to
said
the
lady
of
teaby
choice
but
i
ai
the
right
one
do
you
go
to
settin
your
mind
on
me
wuth
while
i
older
than
you
be
an
apt
to
break
down
with
my
rheumatic
complaints
you
do
want
nobody
on
your
hands
i
git
a
younger
woman
i
would
so
i
for
the
right
one
a
sight
o
years
hannah
jane
i
had
a
kind
o
notion
i
should
know
her
right
off
when
i
fust
see
her
but
i
afeared
it
ai
goin
to
be
that
way
i
seen
a
sight
o
nice
smart
women
but
when
the
thought
o
you
was
so
impressed
on
my
mind
day
before
yisterday
i
sorry
to
disobleege
you
but
if
i
have
anybody
i
kind
o
half
promised
to
elder
fry
announced
sister
pinkham
bravely
i
consider
it
more
on
the
off
side
than
i
did
at
first
if
he
continued
preachin
i
favor
it
more
but
i
dread
havin
to
to
a
butter
business
an
to
sense
them
new
machines
ai
as
if
it
i
just
begun
to
have
things
easy
but
there
i
feel
as
if
i
had
a
lot
o
work
left
in
me
an
i
do
know
is
right
to
let
it
go
to
waste
i
expect
the
elder
would
preach
some
by
spells
an
we
could
ride
about
an
see
folks
an
he
always
be
called
to
funerals
an
have
some
variety
one
way
an
another
i
urge
him
not
to
quit
preachin
i
rather
he
ondertook
anythin
else
said
teaby
rising
and
trying
to
find
the
buttons
of
his
linen
duster
i
could
see
a
bitter
shade
of
jealousy
cloud
his
amiable
face
but
sister
pinkham
looked
up
at
him
and
laughed
set
down
set
down
she
said
we
ai
in
no
great
hurry
and
uncle
teaby
relented
and
lingered
i
all
out
o
for
the
eyes
she
told
him
if
you
got
a
vial
o
lemon
left
that
you
part
with
reasonable
i
do
know
but
i
take
that
i
rather
have
caught
you
when
you
was
outward
bound
your
bag
looks
kind
o
slim
everythin
just
before
i
started
the
ginger
that
i
buy
but
it
called
the
best
there
is
the
two
sat
down
and
drove
a
succession
of
sharp
bargains
but
finally
parted
the
best
of
friends
teaby
kindly
recognized
my
presence
from
a
business
point
of
view
and
offered
me
a
choice
of
his
wares
at
reasonable
prices
i
asked
about
a
delightful
which
made
its
appearance
and
wished
very
much
to
become
the
owner
for
it
was
curiously
whittled
out
and
fitted
together
by
teaby
own
hands
he
exhibited
the
toy
to
sister
pinkham
and
me
to
our
great
pleasure
but
scorned
to
sell
such
a
trifle
it
being
worth
nothing
and
beside
he
had
made
it
for
a
little
girl
who
lived
two
miles
farther
along
the
road
he
was
following
i
could
see
that
she
was
a
favorite
of
the
old
man
and
said
no
more
about
the
matter
but
provided
myself
as
recommended
with
an
ample
package
of
in
case
of
accident
before
i
got
to
where
i
was
going
and
a
small
bottle
of
described
as
reviving
to
the
faculties
then
we
watched
teaby
plod
away
a
quaint
figure
with
his
large
valise
nearly
touching
the
ground
as
it
hung
slack
from
his
right
hand
the
duster
looked
bleak
and
unseasonable
as
a
cloud
went
over
the
sun
it
appeared
to
symbolize
the
youthful
and
hopes
of
the
wearer
decking
the
autumn
days
of
life
poor
creatur
said
sister
pinkham
there
he
doos
need
somebody
to
look
after
him
she
turned
to
me
frankly
and
i
asked
how
far
he
was
going
oh
he
put
up
at
that
little
gal
house
an
git
his
dinner
and
give
her
the
an
trade
a
little
an
then
he
work
along
the
road
callin
from
place
to
place
he
got
a
good
deal
system
an
was
a
smart
boy
so
that
folks
expected
he
was
goin
to
make
a
doctor
but
he
kind
o
petered
out
he
harpin
an
some
folks
prays
him
by
if
they
can
but
there
most
likes
him
an
there
nobody
would
be
more
missed
he
do
make
no
trouble
for
he
take
right
holt
an
help
and
there
nobody
more
gentle
with
the
sick
always
has
some
o
his
nonsense
over
to
me
this
was
added
with
sudden
consciousness
that
i
must
have
heard
the
recent
conversation
but
we
only
smiled
at
each
other
and
good
sister
pinkham
did
not
seem
displeased
we
both
turned
to
look
again
at
the
small
figure
of
teaby
as
he
went
away
with
his
queer
tripping
gait
along
the
level
road
pretty
day
if
quite
so
warm
said
sister
pinkham
as
she
rose
and
reached
for
her
bandbox
and
bundle
to
resume
her
own
journey
there
if
here
ai
uncle
teaby
umbrilla
he
forgits
everything
that
belongs
to
him
but
that
old
valise
folks
know
him
if
he
left
that
you
may
as
well
just
hand
it
to
asa
briggs
the
when
he
gits
back
like
not
the
old
gentleman
think
to
call
for
it
as
he
comes
back
along
here
his
fan
too
but
he
wo
be
likely
to
want
that
this
winter
she
looked
at
the
large
umbrella
there
was
a
great
deal
of
good
material
in
it
but
it
was
considerably
out
of
repair
i
do
know
but
i
stop
an
mend
it
up
for
him
poor
old
creatur
she
said
slowly
with
an
apologetic
look
at
me
then
she
sat
down
again
pulled
a
large
needlebook
from
her
deep
and
accessible
pocket
and
sewed
busily
for
some
time
with
strong
stitches
i
sat
by
and
watched
her
and
was
glad
to
be
of
use
in
chasing
her
large
spool
of
linen
thread
which
repeatedly
rolled
away
along
the
platform
sister
pinkham
affectionate
thoughts
were
evidently
following
her
old
friend
i
a
great
mind
to
walk
back
with
the
umbrilla
he
may
need
it
ai
a
great
ways
she
said
to
me
and
then
looked
up
quickly
blushing
like
a
girl
i
wished
she
would
for
my
part
but
it
did
not
seem
best
for
a
stranger
to
give
advice
in
such
serious
business
i
tell
you
what
i
will
do
she
told
me
innocently
a
moment
afterwards
i
take
the
umbrilla
along
with
me
and
leave
word
with
asa
briggs
i
got
it
i
go
right
by
his
house
so
you
need
charge
your
mind
nothin
about
it
by
the
time
she
had
taken
off
her
spectacles
and
put
them
carefully
away
and
was
ready
to
make
another
start
she
had
learned
where
i
came
from
and
where
i
was
going
and
what
my
name
was
all
this
being
but
poor
return
for
what
i
had
gleaned
of
the
history
of
herself
and
teaby
i
watched
sister
pinkham
until
she
disappeared
umbrella
in
hand
over
the
crest
of
a
hill
far
along
the
road
to
the
eastward
the
luck
of
the
bogans
i
the
old
beggar
women
of
bantry
streets
had
seldom
showered
their
blessings
upon
a
departing
group
of
emigrants
with
such
hearty
good
will
as
they
did
upon
mike
bogan
and
his
little
household
one
may
morning
peggy
muldoon
she
of
the
game
leg
and
eye
and
limber
tongue
steadied
herself
well
back
against
the
battered
wall
at
the
street
corner
and
gave
her
whole
energy
to
a
torrent
of
speech
unusual
to
even
her
noble
powers
she
would
not
let
mike
bogan
go
to
america
unsaluted
and
unblessed
she
meant
to
do
full
honor
to
this
second
cousin

whinn
the
fragment
of
a
once
active
sailor
who
propelled
himself
by
a
low
truckle
cart
and
two
short
sticks
these
interesting
members
of
society
heard
the
shrill
note
of
their
leader
eloquence
and
suddenly
appeared
like
beetles
out
of
unsuspected
crevices
near
by
the
side
car
upon
which
mike
bogan
and
his
wife
and
child
were
riding
from
their
little
farm
outside
the
town
to
the
place
of
departure
was
stopped
at
the
side
of
the
narrow
street
a
lank
lad
with
eyes
red
from
weeping
sat
swinging
his
long
legs
from
the
car
side
another
car
followed
heavily
laden
with
mike
sister
family
and
a
mourning
yet
envious
group
of
acquaintances
footed
it
in
the
rear
it
was
an
excited
picturesque
little
procession
the
town
was
quickly
aware
of
its
presence
and
windows
went
up
from
house
to
house
and
heads
came
out
of
the
second
and
third
stories
and
even
in
the
top
attics
all
along
the
street
the
air
was
thick
with
blessings
the
quiet
of
bantry
was
permanently
broken
lard
bliss
us
and
save
us
cried
peggy
her
shrill
voice
piercing
the
chatter
and
triumphantly
lifting
itself
in
audible
relief

the
jaunting
car

been
surrounded
by
this
time
and
mike
and

shaking
hands
and
trying
to
respond
impartially
to
the
friendly
farewells
and
blessings
of
their
friends
there
never
had
been
such
a
in
bantry
peggy
muldoon

that
her
eloquence
was
in
danger
of
being
ignored
and
made
a
final
shrill
appeal
who
bury
me
now
she
screamed
with
a
long
wail
which
silenced
the
whole
group
who
lay
me
in
the
grave
micky
gone
from

that
always
gave
me
the
kind
word
and

said
a
sympathetic
voice

bring
you
luck

power
to
you
and
mike
bogan
the
tears
streaming
down
his
honest
cheeks
plunged
deep
into
his
pocket
and
threw
the
old
beggar
a
broad
piece
it
was
a
monstrous
fortune
to
peggy
her
one
eye
glared
with
joy
the
jaunting
car
moved
away
while
she
fell
flat
on
the
ground
in
apparent
excess
of
emotion
the
farewells
were
louder
for
a
minute
then
they
were
stopped
the
excitable
neighborhood
returned
to
its
business
or
idleness
and
the
street
was
still
peggy
rose
rubbing
an
elbow
and
said
with
the
air
of
a
queen
to
her
retinue
coom
away
now
poor
crathurs
so
drink
long
life
to
him
and
marget
dunn
and
biddy
and
tom
whinn
with
his
truckle
cart
disappeared
into
an
alley
what
all
this
whillalu
asked
a
clerical
gentleman
who
came
riding
by
is
the
bogans
going
to
ameriky
yer
reverence
responded
jim
kalehan
the
shoemaker
from
his
low
window
the
folks
gived
them
their
wake
whilst
they
were
here
to
enjoy
it
and
them
was
the
keeners
that
was
goin
hippety
with
lame
legs
and
fine
joy
down
the
convanient
alley
for
beer
god
bless
the
poor
souls
mike
bogan
and
biddy
his
wife
looked
behind
them
again
and
again
mike
blessed
himself
fervently
as
he
caught
a
last
glimpse
of
the
old
church
on
the
hill
where
he
was
christened
and
married
where
his
father
and
his
grandfather
had
been
christened
and
married
and
buried
he
remembered
the
day
when
he
had
first
seen
his
wife
who
was
there
from
glengariff
to
stay
with
her
old
aunt
and
coming
to
early
mass
had
looked
to
him
like
a
strange
sweet
flower
abloom
on
the
gray
stone
pavement
where
she
knelt
the
old
church
had
long
stood
on
the
steep
height
at
the
head
of
bantry
street
and
watched
and
waited
for
her
children
he
would
never
again
come
in
from
his
little
farm
in
the
early
morning
he
never
again
would
be
one
of
the
bantry
men
the
golden
stories
of
life
in
america
turned
to
paltry
tinsel
and
a
love
and
pride
of
the
old
country
never
forgotten
by
her
sons
and
daughters
burned
with
fierce
flame
on
the
inmost
altar
of
his
heart
it
had
all
been
very
easy
to
dream
fine
dreams
of
wealth
and
landownership
but
in
that
moment
the
least
of
the
pink
daisies
that
were
just
opening
on
the
roadside
was
dearer
to
the
emigrant
than
all
the
world
beside
lave
me
down
for
a
bit
of
sod
he
commanded
the
wondering
young
driver
who
would
have
liked
above
all
things
to
sail
for
the
new
world
the
square
of
turf
from
the
hedge
foot
sparkling
with
dew
and
green
with
shamrock
and
gay
with
tiny
flowers
was
carefully
wrapped
in
mike
best
sunday
handkerchief
as
they
went
their
way
biddy
had
covered
her
head
with
her
shawl
it
was
she
who
had
made
the
plan
of
going
to
america
it
was
she
who
was
eager
to
join
some
successful
members
of
her
family
who
had
always
complained
at
home
of
their
unjust
rent
and
the
difficulties
of
the
crops
everybody
said
that
the
times
were
going
to
be
harder
than
ever
that
summer
and
she
was
quick
to
catch
at
the
inflammable
speeches
of
some
lawless
townsfolk
who
were
never
satisfied
with
anything
as
for
mike
the
times
always
seemed
alike
he
did
not
grudge
hard
work
and
he
never
found
fault
with
the
good
irish
weather
his
nature
was
not
resentful
he
only
laughed
when
biddy
assured
him
that
the
gorse
would
soon
grow
in
the
thatch
of
his
head
as
it
did
on
their
cabin
chimney
it
was
only
when
she
said
that
in
america
they
could
make
a
gentleman
of
baby
dan
that
the
father
blue
eyes
glistened
and
a
look
of
determination
came
into
his
face
god
grant
we
come
back
to
it
some
day
said
mike
softly
i
did
know
faix
indeed
how
sorry
i
be
for
lavin
the
owld
place
awh
biddy
girl
is
many
the
weary
day
we
think
of
the
home
left
and
biddy
removed
the
shawl
one
instant
from
her
face
only
to
cover
it
again
and
burst
into
a
new
shower
of
tears
the
next
day
but
one
they
were
sailing
away
out
of
queenstown
harbor
to
the
high
seas
old
ireland
was
blurring
its
green
and
purple
coasts
moment
by
moment
kinsale
lay
low
and
they
had
lost
sight
of
the
white
cabins
on
the
hillsides
and
the
pastures
golden
with
furze
hours
before
the
old
women
on
the
wharves
had
turned
away
from
them
shaking
their
great
cap
borders
hours
before
their
own
feet
had
trodden
the
soil
of
ireland
for
the
last
time
mike
bogan
and
biddy
had
left
home
they
were
well
on
their
way
to
america
luckily
nobody
had
been
with
them
at
last
to
say
they
had
taken
a
more
or
less
active
part
in
the
piteous
general
at
queenstown
but
those
were
not
the
faces
of
their
own
mothers
or
brothers
to
which
they
looked
back
as
the
ship
slid
away
through
the
green
water
well
sure
we
gone
now
said
mike
setting
his
face
westward
and
tramping
the
steerage
deck
i
like
the
say
too
i
belave
me
own
grandfather
was
a
sailor
an
is
a
fine
life
for
a
man
little
dan
goin
to
ameriky
and
niver
mistrustin
we
be
the
gossoon
back
again
rich
and
fine
to
the
owld
place
by
and
by
thrue
for
us
biddy
but
biddy
like
many
another
woman
had
set
great
changes
in
motion
and
then
longed
to
escape
from
their
consequences
she
was
much
discomposed
by
the
ship
unsteadiness
she
accused
patient
mike
of
having
dragged
her
away
from
home
and
friends
she
grew
very
white
in
the
face
and
was
helped
to
her
hard
steerage
berth
where
she
had
plenty
of
time
for
reflection
upon
the
vicissitudes
of
seafaring
as
for
mike
he
grew
more
and
more
enthusiastic
day
by
day
over
their
prospects
as
he
sat
in
the
shelter
of
the
bulkhead
and
tended
little
dan
and
talked
with
his
companions
as
they
sailed
westward
who
of
us
have
made
enough
kindly
allowance
for
the
homesick
ambitious
irish
men
and
women
who
have
landed
every
year
with
such
high
hopes
on
our
shores
there
are
some
of
a
worse
sort
of
whom
their
native
country
might
think
itself
well
rid
but
what
thrifty
new
england
housekeeper
who
takes
into
her
home
one
of
the
little
captive
maids
from
southern
ireland
has
half
understood
the
change
of
surroundings
that
was
a
life
in
the
open
air
under
falling
showers
and
warm
sunshine
a
life
of
wit
and
humor
of
lavishness
and
lack
of
provision
for
more
than
the
passing
day
of
constant
companionship
with
one
neighbors
and
a
cheerful
serenity
and
lack
of
nervous
anticipation
born
of
the
vicinity
of
the
gulf
stream
the
climate
makes
the
characteristics
of
cork
and
kerry
the
fierce
energy
of
the
celtic
race
in
america
is
forced
and
stimulated
by
our
own
keen
air
the
beauty
of
ireland
is
little
hinted
at
by
an
average
orderly
new
england
town
many
a
young
girl
and
many
a
blundering
sturdy
fellow
is
heartsick
with
the
homesickness
and
restraint
of
his
first
year
in
this
golden
country
of
hard
work
to
so
many
of
them
a
house
has
been
but
a
shelter
for
the
night
a
if
you
remember
that
you
do
not
wonder
at
fumbling
fingers
or
impatience
with
our
houses
full
of
trinkets
our
needless
tangle
of
furnishing
bewilders
those
who
still
think
the
flowers
that
grow
of
themselves
in
the
irish
thatch
more
beautiful
than
anything
under
the
cover
of
our
prosaic
shingled
roofs
faix
a
fellow
on
deck
was
telling
me
a
nate
story
the
day
said
mike
to
biddy
bogan
by
way
of

biddy
opened
her

and
laughed
feebly

so
bronzed
and
ruddy
and
above
all
so
happy
that
she
took
heart
we

and
young
thanks

honest

mike

and

tidy
bar

been
in
the
same
business
this
four
year
gone
since
he
come
out
and
twenty
pince
in
his
pocket
when
he
landed
and
this
year
he
took
a
month
off
and
went
over
to
see
the
ould
folks
and
build
a
dacint
house
intirely
and
hire
a
man
to
farm
wid
now

fool
head
on

then
and
let
out
to
him
what
manes
you
had
whispered
biddy
fiercely
and
lifting
herself
to
look
at
him
i
did
then
was
no
harm
answered
the
unsuspecting
mike
was
a
rascal
won
the
truth
from
you
and
biddy
roused
her
waning
forces
and
that
very
afternoon
appeared
on
deck
the
man
knew
that
he
had
lost
the
day
when
he
caught
her
first
scornful
glance
god
pity
the
old
folks
of
him
an
their
house
muttered
the
wife
to
mike
as
she
looked
at
the
scheming
fellow
whom
she
suspected
of
treachery
he
said
thim
was
old
clothes
he
was
wearin
on
the
sea
apologized
mike
for
his
friend
looking
down
somewhat
consciously
at
his
own
comfortable
corduroys
he
and
biddy
had
been
well
to
do
on
their
little
farm
and
on
good
terms
with
their
landlord
the
old
squire
poor
old
gentleman
it
had
been
a
sorrow
to
him
to
let
the
young
people
go
he
was
a
generous
kindly
old
man
but
he
suffered
from
the
evil
repute
of
some
shortsighted
neighbors
if
i
gave
up
all
i
had
in
the
world
and
went
to
the
almshouse
myself
they
would
still
damn
me
for
a
landlord
he
said
desperately
one
day
but
i
never
thought
mike
bogan
would
throw
up
his
good
chances
i
suppose
some
worthless
fellow
called
him
and
off
he
must
go
there
was
some
unhappiness
at
first
for
the
young
people
in
america
they
went
about
the
streets
of
their
chosen
town
for
a
day
or
two
with
disappointment
their
old
neighbors
were
not
housed
in
palaces
after
all
as
the
letters
home
had
suggested
and
after
a
few
evenings
of
visiting
and
giving
of
messages
and
a
few
days
of
aimless
straying
about
mike
and
biddy
hired
two
rooms
at
a
large
rent
up
three
flights
of
stairs
and
went
to
housekeeping
litte
dan
rolled
down
one
flight
the
first
day
no
more
tumbling
on
the
green
turf
among
the
daisies
for
him
poor
baby
boy
his
father
got
work
at
the
forge
of
a
carriage
shop
having
served
a
few
months
with
a
smith
at
home
and
so
taking
rank
almost
as
a
skilled
laborer
he
was
a
great
favorite
speedily
his
pay
was
good
at
least
it
would
have
been
good
if
he
had
lived
on
the
old
place
among
the
fields
but
he
and
biddy
did
not
know
how
to
make
the
most
of
it
here
and
dan
had
a
baby
sister
presently
to
keep
him
company
and
then
another
and
another
and
there
they
lived
in
the
heat
in
the
cold
in
daisy
time
and
snow
time
and
dan
was
put
to
school
and
came
home
with
a
knowledge
of
sums
in
arithmetic
which
set
his
father
eyes
dancing
with
delight
but
with
a
knowledge
besides
of
foul
language
and
a
brutal
way
of
treating
his
little
sisters
when
nobody
was
looking
on
mike
bogan
was
young
and
strong
when
he
came
to
america
and
his
good
red
blood
lasted
well
but
it
was
against
his
nature
to
work
in
a
hot
shop
and
in
a
very
few
years
he
began
to
look
pale
about
the
mouth
and
shaky
in
the
shoulders
and
then
the
enthusiastic
promises
of
the
man
on
the
ship
borne
out
we
must
allow
by
mike
own
observation
inclined
him
and
his
hard
earned
capital
to
the
purchase
of
a
tidy
looking
drinking
shop
on
a
side
street
of
the
town
the
owner
had
died
and
his
widow
wished
to
go
west
to
live
with
her
son
she
knew
the
bogans
and
was
a
respectable
soul
in
her
way
she
and
her
husband
had
kept
a
quiet
place
everybody
acknowledged
and
everybody
was
thankful
that
since
drinking
shops
must
be
kept
so
decent
a
man
as
mike
bogan
was
taking
up
the
business
ii
the
luck
of
the
bogans
proved
to
be
holding
true
in
this
generation
their
proverbial
good
fortune
seemed
to
come
rather
from
an
absence
of
bad
fortune
than
any
special
distinction
granted
the
generation
or
two
before
mike
time
the
good
fellow
sometimes
reminded
himself
gratefully
of
peggy
muldoon
blessing
and
once
sent
her
a
pound
to
keep
christmas
upon
if
he
had
only
known
it
that
unworthy
woman
bestowed
curses
enough
upon
him
because
he
did
not
repeat
it
the
next
year
to
cancel
any
favors
that
might
have
been
anticipated
good
news
flew
back
to
bantry
of
his
prosperity
and
his
comfortable
home
above
the
store
was
a
place
of
reception
and
generous
assistance
to
all
the
westward
straying
children
of
bantry
there
was
a
bit
of
garden
that
belonged
to
the
estate
the
fences
were
trig
and
neat
and
neither
mike
nor
biddy
were
persons
to
let
things
look
shabby
while
they
had
plenty
of
money
to
keep
them
clean
and
whole
it
was
mike
who
walked
behind
the
priest
on
sundays
when
the
collection
was
taken
it
was
mike
whom
good
father
miles
trusted
more
than
any
other
member
of
his
flock
whom
he
confided
in
and
consulted
whom
perhaps
his
reverence
loved
best
of
all
the
parish
because
they
were
both
bantry
men
born
and
bred
and
nobody
but
father
miles
and
biddy
and
mike
bogan
knew
the
full
extent
of
the
father
and
mother
pride
and
hope
in
the
cleverness
and
beauty
of
their
only
son
nothing
was
too
great
and
no
success
seemed
impossible
when
they
tried
to
picture
the
glorious
career
of
little
dan
mike
was
a
kind
father
to
his
little
daughters
but
all
his
hope
was
for
dan
it
was
for
dan
that
he
was
pleased
when
people
called
him
bogan
in
respectful
tones
and
when
he
was
given
a
minor
place
of
trust
at
town
elections
he
thought
with
humble
gladness
that
dan
would
have
less
cause
to
be
ashamed
of
him
by
and
by
when
he
took
his
own
place
as
gentleman
and
scholar
for
there
was
something
different
about
dan
from
the
rest
of
them
plain
irish
folk
that
they
were
dan
was
his
father
idea
of
a
young
lord
he
would
have
liked
to
show
the
boy
to
the
old
squire
and
see
his
look
of
surprise
money
came
in
at
the
shop
door
in
a
steady
stream
there
was
plenty
of
it
put
away
in
the
bank
and
dan
must
wear
clothes
and
look
like
the
best
fellows
at
the
school
he
was
handsomer
than
any
of
them
he
was
the
best
and
quickest
scholar
of
his
class
the
president
of
the
great
carriage
company
had
said
that
he
was
a
very
promising
boy
more
than
once
and
had
put
his
hand
on
mike
shoulder
as
he
spoke
mike
and
biddy
dressed
in
their
best
went
to
the
school
examinations
year
after
year
and
heard
their
son
do
better
than
the
rest
and
saw
him
noticed
and
admired
for
dan
sake
no
noisy
men
were
allowed
to
stay
about
the
shop
dan
himself
was
forbidden
to
linger
there
and
so
far
the
boy
had
clear
honest
eyes
and
an
affectionate
way
with
his
father
that
almost
broke
that
honest
heart
with
joy
they
talked
together
when
they
went
to
walk
on
sundays
and
there
was
a
plan
increasingly
interesting
to
both
of
going
to
old
bantry
some
summer
just
for
a
treat
oh
happy
days
they
must
end
as
summer
days
do
in
winter
weather
there
was
an
outside
stair
to
the
two
upper
stories
where
the
bogans
lived
above
their
place
of
business
and
late
one
evening
when
the
shop
shutters
were
being
clasped
together
below
biddy
bogan
heard
a
familiar
heavy
step
and
hastened
to
hold
her
brightest
lamp
in
the
doorway
god
save
you
said
his
reverence
father
miles
who
was
coming
up
slowly
and
biddy
dropped
a
decent
courtesy
and
devout
blessing
in
return
his
reverence
looked
pale
and
tired
and
seated
himself
wearily
in
a
chair
by
the
window
while
biddy
coasted
round
by
a
bedroom
door
to
whist
at
two
wakeful
daughters
who
were
teasing
each
other
and
chattering
in
bed
is
long
since
we
saw
you
here
sir
she
said
respectfully
is
warm
weather
indade
for
you
to
be
about
the
town
and
folks
sick
an
dyin
and
needing
your
help
sir
mike
be
up
now
your
reverence
i
hear
him
below
biddy
had
grown
into
a
stout
mother
of
a
family
and
bustling
there
was
little
likeness
left
to
the
rose
of
glengariff
with
whom
mike
had
fallen
in
love
at
early
mass
in
bantry
church
but
the
change
had
been
so
gradual
that
mike
himself
had
never
become
conscious
of
any
damaging
difference
she
took
a
fresh
loaf
of
bread
and
cut
some
generous
slices
and
put
a
piece
of
cheese
and
a
knife
on
the
table
within
reach
of
father
miles
hand
i
suppose
is
waste
of
time
to
give
you
more
so
it
is
she
said
to
him
bread
cheese
and
no
better
will
you
ate
i
suppose
sir
and
she
folded
her
arms
across
her
breast
and
stood
looking
at
him
how
is
the
luck
of
the
bogans
asked
the
kind
old
man
the
head
of
the
school
i
make
no
doubt
and
at
this
moment
mike
came
up
the
stairs
and
greeted
his
priest
with
reverent
affection
you
looking
faint
sir
he
urged
biddy
get
a
glass
now
quite
by
ourselves
sir
and
i
something
for
sickness
that
very
soft
and
fine
entirely
well
well
this
once
then
answered
father
miles
doubtfully
had
a
hard
day
he
held
the
glass
in
his
hand
for
a
moment
and
then
pushed
it
away
from
him
on
the
table
indeed
it
not
wrong
in
itself
said
the
good
priest
looking
up
presently
as
if
he
had
made
something
clear
to
his
mind
the
wrong
is
in
ourselves
to
make
beasts
of
ourselves
with
taking
too
much
of
it
i
do
shame
me
with
this
glass
of
the
best
that
you
poured
for
me
my
own
sin
is
in
the
it
wilds
my
head
when
i
got
most
use
for
it
and
i
sure
of
an
aching
pate
god
forgive
me
for
indulgence
but
i
must
have
it
for
my
breakfast
now
and
then
give
me
a
bit
of
bread
and
cheese
yes
that
what
i
want
bridget
and
he
pushed
the
glass
still
farther
away
i
been
at
a
sorry
place
this
night
he
went
on
a
moment
later
the
smell
of
the
stuff
ca
but
remind
me
is
a
comfort
to
come
here
and
find
your
house
so
clean
and
decent
and
both
of
you
looking
me
in
the
face
god
save
all
poor
sinners
and
mike
and
his
wife
murmured
assent
i
wish
to
god
you
were
out
of
this
business
and
every
honest
man
with
you
said
the
priest
suddenly
dropping
his
fatherly
bantry
good
fellowship
and
making
his
host
conscious
of
the
solemnity
of
the
church
altar
is
a
decent
shop
you
keep
mike
my
lad
i
know
i
know
no
harm
of
it
but
there
are
weak
souls
that
ca
master
themselves
and
the
drink
drags
them
down
there
little
use
in
doing
away
with
the
shops
though
we
got
to
make
young
men
strong
enough
to
let
drink
alone
the
drink
will
always
be
in
the
world
here
your
bright
young
son
what
are
they
teaching
him
at
his
school
do
ye
know
has
his
characther
grown
do
ye
think
mike
bogan
and
is
he
going
to
be
a
man
for
good
and
to
help
decent
things
get
a
start
and
bad
things
to
keep
their
place
i
do
care
how
he
does
his
sums
so
i
do
if
he
has
no
characther
and
they
may
fight
about
beer
and
fight
about
temperance
and
carry
their
father
matthew
flags
flying
high
so
they
may
and
it
all
no
good
lessen
we
can
raise
the
young
folks
up
above
the
place
where
drink
and
shame
can
touch
them
god
grant
us
help
he
whispered
dropping
his
head
on
his
breast
getting
to
be
an
old
man
myself
and
i
never
known
the
temptation
that
like
a
hounding
devil
to
many
men
i
can
let
drink
alone
god
pity
those
who
ca
keep
the
young
lads
out
from
it
mike
you
a
good
fellow
you
careful
but
poor
human
souls
are
weak
god
knows
is
thrue
for
you
indade
sir
responded
biddy
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
at
father
miles
tone
and
earnestness
but
she
could
not
have
made
clear
to
herself
what
he
had
said
will
i
put
a
dhrap
more
of
wather
in
it
your
riverence
she
suggested
but
the
priest
shook
his
head
gently
and
taking
a
handful
of
parish
papers
out
of
his
pocket
proceeded
to
hold
conference
with
the
master
of
the
house
biddy
waited
a
while
and
at
last
ventured
to
clear
away
the
good
priest
frugal
supper
she
left
the
glass
but
he
went
away
without
touching
it
and
in
the
very
afterglow
of
his
parting
blessing
she
announced
that
she
had
the
makings
of
a
pain
within
and
took
the
cordial
with
apparent
approval
mike
did
not
make
any
comment
he
was
tired
and
it
was
late
and
long
past
their
bedtime
biddy
was
wide
awake
and
talkative
from
her
tonic
and
soon
pursued
the
subject
of
conversation
what
set
the
father
out
wid
talking
i
do
know
she
inquired
a
little
was
thrue
for
him
that
we
kape
a
dacint
shop
anyhow
an
how
will
it
be
in
the
way
of
poor
danny
when
it
finding
the
manes
to
put
him
where
he
is
that
he
mint
at
all
answered
mike
from
his
pillow
did
ye
hear
what
he
said
after
endeavoring
fruitlessly
to
repeat
it
in
his
own
words
he
right
sure
about
a
getting
thim
books
and
having
no
characther
he
thinks
well
of
danny
and
he
knows
no
harm
of
him
wisha
what
we
do
wid
that
biddy
i
do
know
says
he
to
me
today
could
ye
wait
an
bring
me
into
the
wurruld
on
american
soil
says
he
maybe
i
been
prisident
says
he
and
was
the
thruth
for
him
i
rather
for
him
to
be
a
priest
meself
replied
the
mother
that
what
father
miles
said
himself
the
other
day
announced
mike
wide
awake
now
wish
he
the
makings
of
a
good
priest
said
he
soon
be
need
of
good
men
and
hard
picking
for
too
said
he
and
he
let
a
great
sigh
is
money
they
want
and
place
they
want
most
o
them
in
the
siminary
is
the
old
fashioned
min
like
mesilf
that
think
however
will
they
get
souls
through
this
life
and
through
heaven
gate
at
last
wid
clane
names
and
dacint
names
left
after
them
thim
was
his
own
words
indade
idication
was
his
cry
always
said
bridget
blessing
herself
in
the
dark
was
only
last
confission
he
took
no
note
of
me
own
sins
while
he
redded
himself
in
the
face
with
why
do
i
kape
mary
ellen
to
the
school
and
myself
not
an
hour
in
the
day
to
rest
my
poor
bones
have
to
kape
her
in
to
mind
the
shmall
childer
says
i
an
was
thrue
for
me
so
it
was
she
gave
a
jerk
under
the
blankets
which
represented
the
courtesy
of
the
occasion
she
had
a
great
respect
and
some
awe
for
father
miles
but
she
considered
herself
to
have
held
her
ground
in
that
discussion
we
do
our
best
by
them
all
sure
answered
mike
is
tribbling
me
money
i
am
ivery
day
he
added
gayly
the
himsilf
is
no
surer
of
a
good
than
you
an
me
what
if
we
made
a
priest
of
dan
intirely
with
a
great
outburst
of
proper
pride
a
son
of
your
own
at
the
alther
saying
mass
for
you
biddy
flaherty
from
glengariff
he
no
mind
for
it
more
the
grief
answered
the
mother
unexpectedly
shaking
her
head
gloomily
on
the
pillow
but
marruk
me
wuds
now
he
ride
in
his
carriage
when
i
under
the
sods
give
me
grace
and
you
too
mike
bogan
look
at
the
airs
of
him
and
the
toss
of
his
head
says
he
to
me
goin
to
be
a
big
man
says
he
i
grow
up
d
ye
think
anybody
take
me
fer
an
irishman
bad
cess
to
the
fer
that
then
said
mike
it
him
you
are
is
me
own
pride
of
heart
to
come
from
old
bantry
he
lied
to
me
yesterday
gone
saying
would
i
take
him
to
see
the
old
place
wisha
he
got
too
much
tongue
and
he
spindin
me
money
for
me
but
biddy
pretended
to
be
falling
asleep
this
was
not
the
first
time
that
the
honest
pair
had
felt
anxiety
creeping
into
their
pride
about
dan
he
frightened
them
sometimes
he
was
cleverer
than
they
and
the
mother
had
already
stormed
at
the
boy
for
his
misdemeanors
in
her
garrulous
fashion
but
covered
them
from
his
father
notwithstanding
she
felt
an
assurance
of
the
merely
temporary
damage
of
wild
oats
she
believed
it
was
just
as
well
for
a
boy
to
have
his
freedom
and
his
fling
she
even
treated
his
known
lies
as
if
they
were
truth
an
comfortable
soul
was
biddy
who
with
much
shrewdness
and
only
a
trace
of
shrewishness
got
through
this
evil
world
as
best
she
might
the
months
flew
by
mike
bogan
was
a
man
and
he
and
his
wife
looked
somewhat
elderly
as
they
went
to
their
pew
in
the
broad
aisle
on
sunday
morning
danny
usually
came
too
and
the
girls
but
dan
looked
contemptuous
as
he
sat
next
his
father
and
said
his
prayers
perfunctorily
sometimes
he
was
not
there
at
all
and
mike
had
a
heavy
heart
under
his
stiff
best
coat
he
was
richer
than
any
other
member
of
father
miles
parish
and
he
was
known
and
respected
everywhere
as
a
good
citizen
even
the
most
ardent
believers
in
the
temperance
cause
were
known
to
say
that
little
mischief
would
be
done
if
all
the
rumsellers
were
such
men
as
bogan
he
was
generous
and
in
his
limited
way
public
spirited
he
did
his
duty
to
his
neighbor
as
he
saw
it
every
one
used
liquor
more
or
less
somebody
must
sell
it
but
a
low
groggery
was
as
much
a
thing
of
shame
to
him
as
to
any
man
he
never
sold
to
boys
or
to
men
who
had
had
too
much
already
his
shop
was
clean
and
wholesome
and
in
the
evening
when
a
dozen
or
more
of
his
respectable
acquaintances
gathered
after
work
for
a
social
hour
or
two
and
a
glass
of
whiskey
to
rest
and
cheer
them
after
exposure
there
was
not
a
little
good
talk
about
affairs
from
their
point
of
view
and
plenty
of
honest
fun
in
their
own
houses
very
likely
the
rooms
were
close
and
hot
and
the
chairs
hard
and
unrestful
the
wife
had
taken
her
bit
of
recreation
by
daylight
and
visited
her
friends
this
was
their
comfortable
mike
bogan
shop
and
mike
himself
the
leader
of
the
assembly
there
was
a
in
the
man
his
companions
were
contented
though
he
only
looked
on
tolerantly
at
their
fun
for
the
most
part
without
taking
any
active
share
himself
one
cool
october
evening
the
company
was
well
gathered
in
there
was
even
a
glow
of
wood
fire
in
the
stove
and
two
of
the
old
men
were
sitting
close
beside
it
corny
sullivan
had
been
a
soldier
in
the
british
army
for
many
years
he
had
been
wounded
at
last
at
sebastopol
and
yet
here
he
was
full
of
military
lore
and
glory
and
propped
by
a
wooden
leg
corny
was
usually
addressed
an
by
his
familiars
he
was
an
irascible
old
follow
to
deal
with
but
as
clean
as
a
whistle
from
long
habit
and
even
stately
to
look
at
in
his
he
had
a
nephew
with
whom
he
made
his
home
who
would
give
him
an
arm
presently
and
get
him
home
to
bed
his
mate
was
an
old
sailor
much
bent
in
the
back
by
rheumatism
jerry
bogan
who
though
no
relation
was
tenderly
treated
by
mike
being
old
and
poor
his
score
was
never
kept
but
he
seldom
wanted
for
his
evening
grog
jerry
bogan
was
a
cheerful
soul
the
wit
of
the
celts
and
their
pathetic
wilfulness
were
delightful
in
him
the
priest
liked
him
the
doctor
half
loved
him
this
irishman
who
had
a
graceful
compliment
or
a
thrust
of
wit
for
whoever
came
in
his
way
what
a
treasury
of
old
irish
lore
and
legend
was
this
old
sailor
what
broadness
and
good
cheer
and
charity
had
been
fostered
in
his
sailor
heart
the
delight
of
little
children
with
his
clever
tales
and
mysterious
performances
with
bits
of
soft
pine
and
a
sharp
jackknife
a
very
baron
munchausen
of
adventure
and
here
he
sat
round
backed
and
head
pushed
forward
like
an
old
turtle
by
the
fire
the
other
men
sat
or
stood
about
the
room
mike
was
serving
his
friends
there
was
a
clink
of
glass
and
a
stirring
and
shaking
a
pungent
odor
of
tobacco
and
much
laughter
soombody

mike
that
grown
old
and
gray
since
winther
time
and
they
turned
their
eyes
to
the
bar
to
refresh
their
memories
with
the
sight
of
the
disappointed
face
behind
it
there
was
a
rattling
at
the
just
then
and
loud
voices
outside
and
as
the
old
men
looked
young
dan
bogan
came
stumbling
into
the
shop
behind
him
were
two
low
fellows
the
worst
in
the
town
they
had
all
been
drinking
more
than
was
good
for
them
and
for
the
first
time
mike
bogan
saw
his
only
son
boyish
face
reddened
and
stupid
with
whiskey
it
had
been
an
unbroken
law
that
dan
should
keep
out
of
the
shop
with
his
comrades
now
he
strode
forward
with
an
absurd
travesty
of
manliness
and
demanded
liquor
for
himself
and
his
friends
at
his
father
hands
mike
staggered
his
eyes
glared
with
anger
his
fatherly
pride
made
him
long
to
uphold
the
poor
boy
before
so
many
witnesses
he
reached
for
a
glass
then
he
pushed
it
away
and
with
quick
step
reached
side
caught
him
by
the
collar
and
held
him
one
or
two
of
the
spectators
chuckled
with
weak
excitement
but
the
rest
pitied
mike
bogan
as
he
would
have
pitied
them
the
angry
father
pointed
his
son
companions
to
the
door
and
after
a
moment
hesitation
they
went
skulking
out
and
father
and
son
disappeared
up
the
stairway
dan
was
a
coward
he
was
glad
to
be
thrust
into
his
own
bedroom
upstairs
his
head
was
dizzy
and
he
muttered
only
a
feeble
oath
several
of
mike
bogan
customers
had
kindly
disappeared
when
he
returned
trying
to
look
the
same
as
ever
but
one
after
another
the
great
tears
rolled
down
his
cheeks
he
never
had
faced
despair
till
now
he
turned
his
back
to
the
men
and
fumbled
aimlessly
among
the
bottles
on
the
shelf
some
one
came
in
unconscious
of
the
pitiful
scene
and
impatiently
repeated
his
order
to
the
shopkeeper
god
help
me
boys
i
ca
sell
more
this
night
he
said
brokenly
go
home
now
and
lave
me
to
myself
they
were
glad
to
go
though
it
cut
the
evening
short
jerry
bogan
bundled
his
way
last
with
his
two
canes
sind
the
to
say
he
advised
in
a
gruff
whisper
sind
him
out
wid
a
good
captain
now
mike
will
make
a
man
of
him
yet
a
man
of
him
yet
alas
alas
for
the
hopes
that
had
been
growing
so
many
years
alas
for
the
pride
of
a
simple
heart
alas
for
the
day
mike
bogan
came
away
from
sunshiny
old
bantry
with
his
baby
son
in
his
arms
for
the
sake
of
making
that
son
a
gentleman
iii
winter
had
fairly
set
in
but
the
snow
had
not
come
and
the
street
was
bleak
and
cold
the
wind
was
stinging
men
faces
and
piercing
the
wooden
houses
a
hard
night
for
sailors
coming
on
the
coast
a
bitter
night
for
poor
people
everywhere
from
one
house
and
another
the
lights
went
out
in
the
street
where
the
bogans
lived
at
last
there
was
no
other
lamp
than
theirs
in
a
window
that
lighted
the
outer
stairs
sometimes
a
woman
shadow
passed
across
the
curtain
and
waited
there
drawing
it
away
from
the
panes
a
moment
as
if
to
listen
the
better
for
a
footstep
that
did
not
come
poor
biddy
had
waited
many
a
night
before
this
her
husband
was
far
from
well
the
doctor
said
that
his
heart
was
not
working
right
and
that
he
must
be
very
careful
but
the
truth
was
that
mike
heart
was
almost
broken
by
grief
dan
was
going
the
downhill
road
he
had
been
drinking
harder
and
harder
and
spending
a
great
deal
of
money
he
had
smashed
more
than
one
carriage
and
lamed
more
than
one
horse
from
the
livery
stables
and
he
had
kept
the
lowest
company
in
vilest
dens
now
he
threatened
to
go
to
new
york
and
it
had
come
at
last
to
being
the
only
possible
joy
that
he
should
come
home
at
any
time
of
night
rather
than
disappear
no
one
knew
where
he
had
laughed
in
father
face
when
the
good
old
man
after
pleading
with
him
had
tried
to
threaten
him
biddy
was
in
an
agony
of
suspense
as
the
night
wore
on
she
dozed
a
little
only
to
wake
with
a
start
and
listen
for
some
welcome
sound
out
in
the
cold
night
was
her
boy
freezing
to
death
somewhere
other
mothers
only
scolded
if
their
sons
were
wild
but
this
was
killing
her
and
mike
they
had
set
their
hopes
so
high
mike
was
groaning
dreadfully
in
his
sleep
the
fire
was
burning
low
and
she
did
not
dare
to
stir
it
she
took
her
worn
rosary
again
and
tried
to
tell
its
beads
mother
of
pity
pray
for
us
she
said
wearily
dropping
the
beads
in
her
lap
there
was
a
sound
in
the
street
at
last
but
it
was
not
of
one
stumbling
feet
but
of
many
she
was
stiff
with
cold
she
had
slept
long
and
it
was
almost
day
she
rushed
with
strange
apprehension
to
the
doorway
and
stood
with
the
flaring
lamp
in
her
hand
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
the
voices
were
suddenly
hushed
go
for
father
miles
said
somebody
in
a
hoarse
voice
and
she
heard
the
words
they
were
carrying
a
burden
they
brought
it
tip
to
the
mother
who
waited
in
their
arms
lay
her
son
stone
dead
he
had
been
stabbed
in
a
fight
he
had
struck
a
man
down
who
had
sprung
back
at
him
like
a
tiger
dan
little
dan
was
dead
the
luck
of
the
bogans
the
end
was
here
and
a
wail
that
pierced
the
night
and
chilled
the
hearts
that
heard
it
was
the
first
message
of
sorrow
to
the
poor
father
in
his
uneasy
sleep
the
group
of
men
stood
by
some
of
them
had
been
drinking
but
they
were
all
awed
and
shocked
you
would
have
believed
every
one
of
them
to
be
on
the
side
of
law
and
order
mike
bogan
knew
that
the
worst
had
happened
biddy
had
rushed
to
him
and
fallen
across
the
bed
for
one
minute
her
aggravating
shrieks
had
stopped
he
began
to
dress
himself
but
he
was
shaking
too
much
he
stepped
out
to
the
kitchen
and
faced
the
frightened
crowd
is
my
son
dead
then
asked
mike
bogan
of
bantry
with
a
piteous
quiver
of
the
lip
and
nobody
spoke
there
was
something
glistening
and
awful
about
his
pleasant
irish
face
he
tottered
where
he
stood
he
caught
at
a
chair
to
steady
himself
the
luck
o
the
bogans
is
it
and
he
smiled
strangely
then
a
fierce
hardness
came
across
his
face
and
changed
it
utterly
come
down
come
down
he
shouted
and
snatching
the
key
of
the
shop
went
down
the
stairs
himself
with
great
leaps
what
was
in
mike
was
he
crazy
with
grief
they
stood
out
of
his
way
and
saw
him
fling
out
bottle
after
bottle
and
shatter
them
against
the
wall
they
saw
him
roll
one
cask
after
another
to
the
doorway
and
out
into
the
street
in
the
gray
light
of
morning
and
break
through
the
staves
with
a
heavy
axe
nobody
dared
to
restrain
his
fury
there
was
a
devil
in
him
they
were
afraid
of
the
man
in
his
blinded
rage
the
odor
of
whiskey
and
gin
filled
the
cold
air
some
of
them
would
have
stolen
the
wasted
liquor
if
they
could
but
no
man
there
dared
to
move
or
speak
and
it
was
not
until
the
tall
figure
of
father
miles
came
along
the
street
and
the
patient
eyes
that
seemed
always
to
keep
vigil
and
the
calm
voice
with
its
flavor
of
bantry
brogue
came
to
mike
bogan
help
that
he
let
himself
be
taken
out
of
the
wrecked
shop
and
away
from
the
spilt
liquors
to
the
shelter
of
his
home
a
week
later
he
was
only
a
shadow
of
his
sturdy
self
he
was
lying
on
his
bed
dreaming
of
bantry
bay
and
the
road
to
glengariff
the
hedge
roses
were
in
bloom
and
he
was
trudging
along
the
road
to
see
biddy
he
was
working
on
the
old
farm
at
home
and
could
not
put
the
seed
potatoes
in
their
trench
for
little
dan
kept
falling
in
and
getting
in
his
way
dan
not
going
to
be
plagued
with
the
bad
craps
he
muttered
to
father
miles
who
sat
beside
the
bed
dan
will
be
a
fine
squire
in
ameriky
but
the
priest
only
stroked
his
hand
as
it
twitched
and
lifted
on
the
coverlet
what
was
biddy
doing
crying
and
putting
the
candles
about
him
then
mike
poor
brain
grew
steady
oh
my
god
if
we
were
back
in
bantry
i
saw
the
gorse
bloomin
in
the
d
ye
know
oh
wisha
wisha
the
poor
ould
home
an
the
green
praties
that
day
we
come
from
it
with
our
luck
smilin
us
in
the
face
whist
darlin
kape
aisy
darlin
mourned
biddy
with
a
great
sob
father
miles
sat
straight
and
stem
in
his
chair
by
the
pillow
he
had
said
the
prayers
for
the
dying
and
the
holy
oil
was
already
shining
on
mike
bogan
forehead
the
keeners
were
swaying
themselves
to
and
fro
there
where
they
waited
in
the
next
room
fair
day
widow
mercy
bascom
came
back
alone
into
the
empty
kitchen
and
seated
herself
in
her
favorite
chair
by
the
window
with
a
dreary
look
on
her
face
i
i
be
an
old
woman
an
past
goin
to
cattle
shows
junketings
but
folks
need
take
it
so
for
granted
i
sure
i
want
to
be
on
my
feet
all
day
trapesin
fair
grounds
an
everybody
dust
not
but
what
i
as
able
as
most
though
i
be
year
old
she
folded
her
hands
in
her
lap
and
looked
out
across
the
deserted
yard
there
was
not
even
a
hen
in
sight
she
was
left
alone
for
the
day
tobias
folks
as
she
called
the
son
family
with
whom
she
made
her
home
tobias
folks
had
just
started
for
a
day
pleasuring
at
the
county
fair
ten
miles
distant
she
had
not
thought
of
going
with
them
nor
expected
any
invitation
she
had
even
helped
them
off
with
her
famous
energy
but
there
was
an
unexpected
reluctance
at
being
left
behind
a
sad
little
feeling
that
would
rise
suddenly
in
her
throat
as
she
stood
in
the
door
and
saw
them
drive
away
in
the
shiny
wagon
johnny
the
youngest
and
favorite
of
her
grandchildren
had
shouted
back
in
his
piping
voice
i
wish
you
was
goin
grandma
the
only
one
on
that
thought
of
me
said
mercy
bascom
to
herself
and
then
not
being
a
meditative
person
by
nature
she
went
to
work
industriously
and
proceeded
to
the
repairing
of
tobias
coat
it
was
sharp
weather
now
in
the
early
morning
and
he
would
soon
need
the
warmth
of
it
tobias
placid
wife
never
anticipated
and
always
lived
in
a
state
of
trying
to
catch
up
with
her
work
it
never
had
been
the
elder
woman
way
and
mercy
reviewed
her
own
active
career
with
no
mean
pride
she
had
been
left
a
widow
at
with
four
children
and
a
stony
new
hampshire
farm
but
had
bravely
won
her
way
paid
her
debts
and
provided
the
three
girls
and
their
brother
tobias
with
the
best
available
schooling
for
a
woman
of
such
good
judgment
and
high
purpose
in
life
bascom
had
made
a
very
unwise
choice
in
marrying
tobias
bascom
the
elder
he
was
not
even
the
owner
of
a
good
name
and
led
her
a
terrible
life
with
his
drunken
shiftlessness
and
hindrance
of
all
her
own
better
aims
even
while
the
children
were
babies
however
and
life
was
at
its
busiest
and
most
demanding
stages
the
determined
soul
would
not
be
baffled
by
such
damaging
partnership
she
showed
the
plainer
of
what
stuff
she
was
made
and
simply
worked
the
harder
and
went
her
ways
more
fiercely
if
it
were
sometimes
whispered
that
she
was
unamiable
her
wiser
neighbors
understood
the
power
of
will
that
was
needed
to
cope
with
circumstances
that
would
have
crushed
a
weaker
woman
as
for
her
children
they
were
very
fond
of
her
in
the
undemonstrative
new
england
fashion
only
the
two
eldest
could
remember
their
father
at
all
and
after
he
was
removed
from
this
world
tobias
bascom
left
but
slight
proofs
of
having
ever
existed
at
all
except
in
the
stern
lines
and
premature
aging
of
his
wife
face
the
years
that
followed
were
years
of
hard
work
on
the
little
farm
but
diligence
and
perseverance
had
their
reward
when
the
three
daughters
came
to
womanhood
they
were
already
skilled
farmhouse
keepers
and
were
dispatched
for
their
own
homes
well
equipped
with
and
homespun
linen
and
woolen
mercy
bascom
was
glad
to
have
them
well
settled
if
the
truth
were
known
she
did
not
like
to
have
her
own
will
and
law
questioned
or
opposed
and
when
she
sat
down
to
supper
alone
with
her
son
tobias
after
the
last
wedding
she
had
a
glorious
feeling
of
peace
and
satisfaction
there
a
sight
o
work
left
yet
in
the
old
she
said
to
tobias
in
an
unwontedly
affectionate
tone
i
guess
we
shall
keep
house
together
as
comfortable
as
most
folks
but
tobias
grew
very
red
in
the
face
and
bent
over
his
plate
i
don
know
i
want
the
girls
to
get
ahead
of
me
he
said
sheepishly
i
ai
meanin
to
put
you
out
with
another
wedding
right
away
but
i
been
round
an
i
guess
i
found
somebody
to
suit
mercy
bascom
turned
cold
with
misery
and
disappointment
why
she
said
anxiously
folks
always
said
that
you
was
cut
out
for
an
old
bachelor
till
i
come
to
believe
it
an
i
been
lottin
on
course
nobody
goin
to
wrench
me
an
you
apart
said
tobias
gallantly
i
made
up
my
mind
long
ago
you
an
me
was
mother
an
i
had
it
in
my
mind
to
fetch
you
somebody
that
would
ease
you
o
quite
so
much
work
now
gone
off
i
do
want
nobody
said
the
grieved
woman
and
she
could
eat
no
more
supper
that
festive
supper
for
which
she
had
cooked
her
very
best
tobias
was
sorry
for
her
but
he
had
his
rights
and
now
simply
felt
because
he
had
freed
his
mind
of
this
unwelcome
declaration
tobias
was
slow
and
stolid
to
behold
but
he
was
a
man
of
sound
ideas
and
great
talent
for
farming
he
had
found
it
difficult
to
choose
between
his
favorites
among
the
marriageable
girls
a
bright
young
creature
who
was
really
too
good
for
him
but
penniless
and
a
weaker
damsel
who
was
heiress
to
the
best
farm
in
town
the
farm
won
the
day
at
last
and
bascom
felt
a
thrill
of
pride
at
her
worldly
success
then
she
asked
to
know
her
son
plans
and
was
wholly
disappointed
tobias
meant
to
sell
the
old
place
he
had
no
idea
of
leaving
her
alone
as
she
wistfully
complained
he
meant
to
have
her
make
a
new
home
at
the
bassett
place
with
him
and
his
bride
that
she
would
never
do
the
old
place
which
had
given
them
a
living
never
should
be
left
or
sold
to
strangers
tobias
was
not
prepared
for
her
fierce
outburst
of
reproach
at
the
mere
suggestion
she
would
live
alone
and
pay
her
way
as
she
always
had
done
and
so
it
was
for
a
few
years
of
difficulties
tobias
was
never
ready
to
plough
or
plant
when
she
needed
him
his
own
great
farm
was
more
than
he
could
serve
properly
it
grew
more
and
more
difficult
to
hire
workmen
and
they
were
seldom
worth
their
wages
at
last
tobias
wife
who
was
a
kindly
soul
persuaded
her
reluctant
to
come
and
spend
a
winter
the
old
woman
was
tired
and
for
once
disheartened
she
found
herself
deeply
in
love
with
her
grandchildren
and
so
next
spring
she
let
the
little
hill
farm
on
the
halves
to
an
impecunious
but
young
couple
to
everybody
surprise
the
two
women
lived
together
harmoniously
tobias
wife
did
everything
to
please
her
except
to
be
other
than
a
bassett
and
mercy
for
the
most
part
ignored
this
misfortune
and
rarely
was
provoked
into
calling
it
a
fault
now
that
the
necessity
for
hard
work
and
anxiety
was
past
she
appeared
to
have
come
to
an
indian
summer
of
her
natural
amiability
and
tolerance
she
was
sometimes
indirectly
reproachful
of
her
ways
and
set
an
indignant
example
now
and
then
by
a
famous
onslaught
of
unnecessary
work
and
always
dressed
and
behaved
herself
in
plainest
farm
fashion
while
tobias
was
given
to
undue
worldliness
and
style
but
they
worked
well
together
in
the
main
for
to
use
mercy
own
words
she
had
seen
enough
of
life
not
to
want
to
go
into
other
folks
houses
and
make
trouble
as
people
grow
older
their
interests
are
apt
to
become
fewer
and
one
of
the
thoughts
that
came
oftenest
to
mercy
bascom
in
her
old
age
was
a
quarrel
with
one
of
her
husband
sisters
who
had
been
her
neighbor
many
years
before
and
then
moved
to
greater
prosperity
at
the
other
side
of
the
county
it
is
not
worth
while
to
tell
the
long
story
of
accusations
and
misunderstandings
but
while
the
two
women
did
not
meet
for
almost
half
a
lifetime
the
grievance
was
as
fresh
as
if
it
were
yesterday
wrongs
of
defrauded
sums
of
money
and
contested
rights
in
unproductive
acres
of
land
wrongs
of
slighting
remarks
and
contempt
of
equal
claims
the
remembrance
of
all
these
was
treasured
as
a
miser
fingers
his
gold
mercy
bascom
freed
herself
from
the
wearisome
detail
of
life
whenever
she
could
find
a
patient
listener
to
whom
to
tell
the
long
story
she
found
it
as
interesting
as
a
story
of
the
arabian
nights
or
an
exciting
play
at
the
theatre
she
would
have
you
believe
that
she
was
faultless
in
the
matter
and
would
not
acknowledge
that
her
ruth
bascom
now
parlet
was
also
a
woman
with
dependent
little
children
at
the
time
of
the
great
fray
of
late
years
her
son
had
suspected
that
his
mother
regretted
the
alienation
but
he
knew
better
than
to
suggest
a
let
them
work
let
them
work
he
told
his
wife
when
she
proposed
one
night
to
bring
the
warring
unexpectedly
together
it
may
have
been
that
old
mercy
began
to
feel
a
little
lonely
and
would
be
glad
to
have
somebody
of
her
own
age
with
whom
to
talk
over
old
times
she
never
had
known
the
people
much
in
this
bassett
region
and
there
were
few
but
young
folks
left
at
any
rate
as
the
hastened
toward
the
fair
that
bright
october
morning
mercy
sat
by
the
table
sewing
at
a
sufficient
patch
in
the
old
coat
there
was
little
else
to
do
all
day
but
to
get
herself
a
luncheon
at
noon
and
have
supper
ready
when
the
family
came
home
cold
and
tired
at
night
the
two
cats
came
purring
about
her
chair
one
persuaded
her
to
open
the
cellar
door
and
the
other
leaped
to
the
top
of
the
kitchen
table
unrebuked
and
blinked
herself
to
sleep
there
in
the
sun
this
was
a
favored
kitten
brought
from
the
old
home
and
seemed
like
a
link
between
the
old
days
and
these
her
mistress
noticed
with
surprise
that
pussy
was
beginning
to
look
old
and
she
could
not
resist
a
little
sigh
land
the
next
world
may
seem
dreadful
new
too
and
i
got
to
get
used
to
that
she
thought
with
a
grim
smile
of
foreboding
how
do
folks
live
that
wants
always
to
be
on
the
go
there
was
ruth
parlet
that
must
be
always
a
visitin
and
goin
well
i
wo
say
that
there
was
a
time
when
i
wished
for
the
chance
justice
always
won
the
day
in
such
minor
questions
as
this
ruth
parlet
name
started
the
usual
thoughts
but
somehow
or
other
mercy
could
not
find
it
in
her
heart
to
be
as
harsh
as
usual
she
remembered
one
thing
after
another
about
their
girlhood
together
they
had
been
great
friends
then
and
the
animosity
may
have
had
its
root
in
the
fact
that
ruth
helped
forward
her
brother
marriage
but
there
were
years
before
that
of
friendly
foregathering
and
girlish
alliances
and
rivalries
spinning
and
herb
gathering
and
quilting
it
seemed
as
mercy
thought
about
it
that
ruth
was
good
company
after
all
but
what
did
make
her
act
so
and
turn
right
round
later
on
the
morning
grew
warm
and
at
last
bascom
had
to
open
the
window
to
let
out
the
buzzing
flies
and
an
imprisoned
wild
bee
the
patch
was
finished
and
the
elbow
would
serve
tobias
as
good
as
new
she
laid
the
coat
over
a
chair
and
put
her
bent
brass
thimble
into
the
box
that
served
as
she
used
to
have
a
queer
splint
basket
at
the
old
place
but
it
had
been
broken
under
something
heavier
when
her
household
goods
were
moved
some
of
the
family
had
long
been
tired
of
hearing
that
basket
regretted
and
another
had
never
been
found
worthy
to
take
its
place
the
thimble
the
smooth
mill
bobbin
on
which
was
wound
black
linen
thread
the
dingy
lump
of
beeswax
and
a
smart
leather
which
johnny
had
given
her
the
christmas
before
all
looked
ready
for
use
but
bascom
pushed
them
farther
back
on
the
table
and
quickly
rose
to
her
feet
ai
nine
yet
she
said
exultantly
i
just
take
a
couple
o
crackers
in
my
pocket
and
step
over
to
the
old
place
i
take
my
time
and
be
back
soon
enough
to
make
that
pan
o
my
hot
gingerbread
they
be
counting
on
for
supper
half
an
hour
later
one
might
have
seen
a
bent
figure
lock
the
side
door
of
the
large
farmhouse
carefully
trying
the
latch
again
and
again
to
see
if
it
were
fast
putting
the
key
into
a
safe
by
the
door
and
then
stepping
away
up
the
road
with
eager
determination
i
ai
felt
so
like
a
jaunt
this
five
year
said
mercy
to
herself
an
if
tobias
was
here
an
ann
they
take
all
the
fun
out
fussin
and
talkin
an
bein
afeard
i
tire
myself
or
wantin
me
to
ride
over
i
do
like
to
be
my
own
master
once
in
a
while
the
autumn
day
was
glorious
with
a
fine
flavor
of
fruit
and
ripeness
in
the
air
the
sun
was
warm
there
was
a
cool
breeze
from
the
great
hills
and
far
off
across
the
wide
valley
the
old
woman
could
see
her
little
gray
house
on
its
pleasant
eastern
slope
she
could
even
trace
the
outline
of
the
two
small
fields
and
large
pasture
i
done
well
with
it
if
i
was
nothin
but
a
woman
with
four
dependin
on
me
no
means
said
mercy
proudly
as
she
came
in
full
sight
of
the
old
place
it
was
a
long
drive
from
one
farm
to
the
other
by
roundabout
highways
but
there
was
a
footpath
known
to
the
wayfarer
which
took
a
good
piece
off
the
distance
now
ai
this
a
sight
better
than
them
hustlin
fairs
mercy
asked
gleefully
as
she
felt
herself
free
and
alone
in
the
wide
she
had
long
been
promising
little
johnny
to
take
him
over
to
house
as
she
loved
to
call
it
still
she
could
not
help
thinking
longingly
how
much
he
would
enjoy
this
escapade
why
i
running
away
just
like
a
what
i
be
she
exclaimed
and
then
laughed
aloud
for
very
pleasure
the
farmhouse
was
deserted
that
day
as
its
former
owner
suspected
she
boldly
gathered
some
of
her
valued
with
an
assuring
sense
of
proprietorship
as
she
crossed
the
last
narrow
field
the
browns
man
and
wife
and
little
boy
and
baby
had
hied
them
early
to
the
fair
with
nearly
the
whole
population
of
the
countryside
the
house
and
yard
and
never
had
worn
such
an
aspect
of
appealing
pleasantness
as
when
mercy
bascom
came
near
she
felt
as
if
she
were
going
to
cry
for
a
minute
and
then
hurried
to
get
inside
the
gate
she
saw
the
outgoing
track
of
horses
feet
with
delight
but
went
discreetly
to
the
door
and
knocked
to
make
herself
perfectly
sure
that
there
was
no
one
left
at
home
out
of
breath
and
tired
as
she
was
she
turned
to
look
off
at
the
view
yes
there
was
tobias
place
prosperous
and
she
could
just
get
a
glimpse
of
the
upper
roofs
and
gables
it
was
always
a
sorrow
and
complaint
that
a
low
hill
kept
her
from
looking
up
at
this
farm
from
any
of
the
windows
but
now
that
she
was
at
the
farm
itself
she
found
herself
regarding
tobias
home
with
a
good
deal
of
affection
she
looked
sharply
with
an
apprehension
of
fire
but
there
was
no
whiff
of
alarming
smoke
against
the
dear
sky
now
i
must
git
me
a
drink
o
that
water
first
of
anything
and
she
hastened
to
the
creaking
and
lowered
the
bucket
there
was
the
same
rusty
handleless
tin
dipper
that
she
had
left
years
before
standing
on
the
shelf
inside
the
she
was
proud
to
find
that
the
bucket
was
no
heavier
than
ever
and
was
heartily
thankful
for
the
clear
water
there
never
was
such
a
well
as
that
and
it
seemed
as
if
she
had
not
been
away
a
day
what
an
old
gal
i
be
said
mercy
with
plaintive
merriment
well
they
ai
made
no
great
changes
since
i
was
here
last
spring
and
then
she
went
over
and
held
her
face
close
against
one
of
the
kitchen
windows
and
took
a
hungry
look
at
the
familiar
room
the
bedroom
door
was
open
and
a
new
sense
of
attachment
to
the
place
filled
her
heart
it
seems
as
if
i
was
locked
out
o
my
own
home
she
whispered
as
she
looked
in
there
were
the
same
old
spruce
and
pine
boards
that
she
had
scrubbed
so
many
times
and
trodden
thin
as
she
hurried
to
and
fro
about
her
work
it
was
very
strange
to
see
an
unfamiliar
chair
or
two
but
the
furnishings
of
a
farm
kitchen
were
much
the
same
and
there
was
no
great
change
even
the
cradle
was
like
that
cradle
in
which
her
own
children
had
been
rocked
she
gazed
and
gazed
poor
old
mother
bascom
and
forgot
the
present
as
her
early
life
came
back
in
vivid
memories
at
last
she
turned
away
from
the
window
with
a
sigh
the
flowers
that
she
had
planted
herself
long
ago
had
bloomed
all
summer
in
the
garden
there
were
still
some
ragged
sailors
and
the
snowberries
and
phlox
and
her
favorite
white
mallows
of
which
she
picked
herself
a
posy
i
glad
the
old
place
is
so
well
took
care
of
she
thought
gratefully
an
they
the
old
barn
i
do
declare
and
battened
the
cracks
to
keep
the
dumb
creatures
warm
was
a
barn
anyways
but
was
the
best
i
could
do
when
the
needed
something
every
handturn
o
the
day
it
put
me
to
some
expense
every
year
tinkering
of
it
up
where
the
poor
lumber
warped
and
split
there
i
enjoyed
to
cope
with
things
and
gettin
the
better
of
my
disadvantages
the
ground
too
rich
for
me
over
there
to
tobias
i
do
want
things
too
easy
for
my
part
i
feel
most
as
young
as
ever
i
did
and
i
ai
agoin
to
play
helpless
not
for
nobody
i
declare
for
i
mean
to
come
up
here
by
an
by
a
spell
an
stop
with
the
young
folks
an
give
a
good
lift
with
their
work
i
ai
needed
all
the
time
to
tobias
s
now
and
they
can
hire
help
while
these
ca
i
been
favoring
myself
till
i
as
soft
as
an
old
hoss
that
right
out
of
pasture
an
ca
pull
two
wheels
without
wheezin
there
was
a
sense
of
companionship
in
the
very
weather
the
bees
were
abroad
as
if
it
were
summer
and
a
flock
of
little
birds
came
fluttering
down
close
to
bascom
as
she
sat
on
the
doorstep
she
remembered
the
biscuits
in
her
pocket
and
ate
them
with
a
hunger
she
had
seldom
known
of
late
but
she
threw
the
crumbs
generously
to
her
feathered
neighbors
the
soft
air
the
brilliant
or
fading
colors
of
the
wide
landscape
the
comfortable
feeling
of
relationship
to
her
surroundings
all
served
to
put
good
old
mercy
into
a
most
peaceful
state
there
was
only
one
thought
that
would
not
let
her
be
quite
happy
she
could
not
get
her
ruth
parlet
out
of
her
mind
and
strangely
enough
the
old
grudge
did
not
present
itself
with
the
usual
power
of
aggravation
it
was
of
their
early
friendship
and
ruth
good
fellowship
that
memories
would
come
i
declare
for
i
would
own
up
to
the
folks
but
i
should
like
to
have
a
good
visit
with
ruth
if
so
be
that
we
could
set
aside
the
past
she
said
resolutely
at
last
i
never
thought
i
should
come
to
it
but
if
she
offered
to
make
peace
i
would
do
nothin
to
hinder
it
not
to
say
but
what
i
should
have
to
free
my
mind
on
one
or
two
points
before
we
could
start
fair
i
waited
forty
year
to
make
one
remark
to
ruthy
parlet
but
there
we
gettin
to
be
old
folks
mercy
rebuked
herself
gravely
i
do
want
to
go
off
with
hard
feelins
to
nobody
whether
this
was
the
culmination
of
a
long
slow
process
of
reconciliation
or
whether
bascom
placid
satisfaction
helped
to
hasten
it
by
many
stages
nobody
could
say
as
she
sat
there
she
thought
of
many
things
her
life
spread
itself
out
like
a
picture
perhaps
never
before
had
she
been
able
to
detach
herself
from
her
immediate
occupation
in
this
way
she
never
had
been
aware
of
her
own
character
and
exploits
to
such
a
degree
and
the
minutes
sped
by
as
she
thought
with
deep
interest
along
the
course
of
her
own
history
there
was
nothing
she
was
ashamed
of
to
an
uncomfortable
degree
but
the
long
animosity
between
herself
and
the
children
aunt
how
harsh
she
had
been
sometimes
she
had
even
tried
to
prejudice
everybody
who
listened
to
these
tales
of
an
offender
i
more
half
right
now
i
come
to
look
myself
full
in
the
face
said
mercy
bascom
and
i
never
owned
it
till
this
day
the
sun
was
already
past
noon
and
the
good
woman
dutifully
rose
and
with
instant
consciousness
of
resource
glanced
in
at
the
kitchen
window
to
tell
the
time
by
a
familiar
mark
on
the
floor
i
start
just
yet
she
muttered
oh
my
how
i
do
wish
i
could
git
in
and
poke
round
into
every
corner
would
make
this
day
just
perfect
there
now
she
continued
they
leave
the
key
just
where
our
folks
used
to
and
in
another
minute
the
key
lay
in
mercy
worn
old
hand
she
gave
a
shrewd
look
along
the
road
opened
the
door
which
creaked
what
may
have
been
a
hearty
welcome
and
stood
inside
the
dear
old
kitchen
she
had
not
been
in
the
house
alone
since
she
left
it
but
now
she
was
nobody
guest
it
was
like
some
finding
its
own
old
shell
again
and
settling
comfortably
into
the
convolutions
even
we
must
not
follow
mother
bascom
about
from
the
dark
cellar
to
the
hot
little
attic
she
was
not
curious
about
the
browns
worldly
goods
indeed
she
was
nearly
unconscious
of
anything
but
the
comfort
of
going
up
and
down
the
short
flight
of
stairs
and
looking
out
of
her
own
windows
with
nobody
to
watch
there
the
place
where
tobias
scratched
the
cupboard
door
with
a
nail
did
i
thrash
him
for
it
good
she
said
once
with
a
proud
remembrance
of
the
time
when
she
was
a
lawgiver
and
proprietor
and
he
dependent
at
length
a
creeping
fear
stole
over
her
lest
the
family
might
return
she
stopped
one
moment
to
look
back
into
the
little
bedroom
how
good
i
did
use
to
sleep
here
she
said
i
worked
as
stout
as
i
could
the
day
through
and
there
no
wakin
up
by
two
in
the
morning
and
smellin
for
fire
and
harkin
for
thieves
like
i
have
to
nowadays
mercy
stepped
away
down
the
long
sloping
field
like
a
young
woman
it
was
a
long
walk
back
to
tobias
even
if
one
followed
the
pleasant
footpaths
across
country
she
was
but
entirely
when
she
came
safely
in
at
the
gate
of
the
bassett
place
i
done
extra
for
me
she
said
as
she
put
away
her
old
shawl
and
bonnet
but
i
goin
to
git
the
best
supper
tobias
folks
have
eat
for
a
year
and
so
she
did
i
over
to
the
old
place
she
announced
bravely
to
her
son
who
had
finished
his
work
and
his
supper
and
was
now
tipped
back
in
his
wooden
against
the
wall
you

mother
responded
tobias
with
instant
excitement
next
fall
then
i
wo
take
no
for
an
answer
but
what

to
the
fair
and
see
what
goin
you
ai
footed
it
way
over
there
mother
bascom
nodded
i
have
she
answered
solemnly
a
minute
later
as
if
the
nod
were
not
enough
son
she
added
lowering
her
voice
i
ai
one
to
give
in
my
rights
but
i
was
thinkin
it
all
over
about
aunt
ruth
parlet
now
if
that
ai
curi
exclaimed
tobias
bringing
his
chair
down
hastily
upon
all
four
legs
i
did
know
just
how
you
take
it
mother
but
i
see
aunt
ruth
to
the
fair
and
she
made
everything
o
me
and
wanted
to
know
how
you
was
and
she
got
me
off
from
the
rest
an
says
she
declare
i
should
like
to
see
your
marm
again
i
wonder
if
she
wo
agree
to
let
bygones
be
bygones
my
sakes
said
mercy
who
was
startled
by
this
news
is
the
hand
o
providence
how
did
she
look
son
a
sight
older
you
look
but
kind
of
natural
too
one
o
her
wives
that
she
made
her
home
with
has
led
her
a
dance
folks
say
poor
old
creatur
we
have
her
over
here
if
your
folks
do
find
fault
i
had
her
in
my
mind
tobias
folks
in
the
shape
of
his
wife
and
little
johnny
appeared
from
the
outer
kitchen
i
have
had
such
a
supper
i
do
know
when
repeated
the
younger
woman
for
at
least
the
fifth
time
you
must
have
been
keepin
busy
all
day
mother
bascom
but
mother
bascom
and
tobias
looked
at
each
other
and
laughed
i
ai
had
such
a
good
time
i
do
know
when
but
my
feet
are
all
of
a
fidget
now
and
i
got
to
git
to
bed
i
runnin
away
since
you
gone
ann
said
the
pleased
old
soul
and
then
went
away
still
laughing
to
her
own
room
she
was
strangely
excited
and
satisfied
as
if
she
had
at
last
paid
a
debt
she
could
trudge
across
pastures
as
well
as
anybody
and
the
old
grudge
was
done
with
mercy
hardly
noticed
how
her
fingers
trembled
as
she
unhooked
the
old
gray
gown
the
odor
of
sweet
fern
shook
out
fresh
and
strong
as
she
smoothed
and
laid
it
carefully
over
a
chair
there
was
a
little
rent
in
the
skirt
but
she
could
mend
it
by
daylight
the
great
harvest
moon
was
shining
high
in
the
sky
and
she
needed
no
other
light
in
the
bedroom
i
a
smart
woman
to
work
in
my
day
and
i
airnt
a
little
pleasurin
said
mother
bascom
sleepily
to
herself
poor
ruthy
so
she
looks
old
does
she
i
goin
to
tell
her
right
out
was
i
that
spoke
first
to
tobias
going
to
shrewsbury
the
train
stopped
at
a
way
station
with
apparent
unwillingness
and
there
was
barely
time
for
one
elderly
passenger
to
be
hurried
on
board
before
a
sudden
jerk
threw
her
almost
off
her
unsteady
old
feet
and
we
moved
on
at
my
first
glance
i
saw
only
a
perturbed
old
countrywoman
laden
with
a
large
basket
and
a
heavy
bundle
tied
up
in
an
then
i
discovered
that
she
was
a
friend
of
mine
peet
who
lived
on
a
small
farm
several
miles
from
the
village
she
used
to
be
renowned
for
good
butter
and
fresh
eggs
and
the
earliest
cowslip
greens
in
fact
she
always
made
the
most
of
her
farm
slender
resources
but
it
was
some
time
since
i
had
seen
her
drive
by
from
market
in
her
ancient
wagon
the
brakeman
followed
her
into
the
crowded
car
also
carrying
a
number
of
packages
i
leaned
forward
and
asked
peet
to
sit
by
me
it
was
a
great
pleasure
to
see
her
again
the
brakeman
seemed
relieved
and
smiled
as
he
tried
to
put
part
of
his
burden
into
the
rack
overhead
but
even
the
flowered
was
much
too
large
and
he
explained
that
he
would
take
care
of
everything
at
the
end
of
the
car
peet
was
not
large
herself
but
with
the
big
basket
and
the
and
some
possessions
of
my
own
we
had
very
little
spare
room
so
this
is
what
you
call
ridin
in
the
cars
well
i
do
declare
said
my
friend
as
soon
as
she
had
recovered
herself
a
little
she
looked
pale
and
as
if
she
had
been
in
tears
but
there
was
the
familiar
gleam
of
good
humor
in
her
tired
old
eyes
where
in
the
world
are
you
going
mrs
peet
i
asked
ca
be
you
ai
heared
about
me
dear
said
she
well
the
world
bigger
than
i
used
to
think
was
i
broke
up
was
the
only
thing
do
and
i
to
shrewsbury
to
shrewsbury
have
you
sold
the
farm
i
exclaimed
with
sorrow
and
surprise
peet
was
too
old
and
too
characteristic
to
be
suddenly
transplanted
from
her
native
soil
mine
the
place
her
pleasant
face
hardened
slightly
he
was
coaxed
an
into
signin
off
before
he
was
taken
away
son
of
his
sister
that
married
old
josh
peet
come
it
over
him
about
his
bein
past
work
and
how
he
do
for
him
like
an
own
son
an
we
owed
him
a
little
somethin
i
paid
off
everythin
but
that
an
was
fool
enough
to
leave
it
till
the
last
on
account
o
bein
a
relation
and
not
needin
his
pay
much
as
some
others
did
it
hurt
me
to
have
the
place
fall
into
other
hands
some
wanted
me
to
go
right
to
law
but
would
be
no
use
smarter
i
be
about
them
matters
you
see
he
got
my
name
on
the
paper
too
he
said
was
somethin
bein
responsible
for
the
taxes
we
was
scant
o
money
an
i
was
wore
out
with
watchin
an
being
broke
o
my
rest
after
my
tryin
hard
for
risin
year
to
provide
for
bein
past
work
here
i
be
dear
here
i
be
i
used
to
drive
things
smart
you
remember
but
we
was
fools
enough
in
to
put
about
everythin
we
had
safe
in
the
bank
into
that
spool
factory
that
come
to
nothin
but
i
tell
ye
i
could
ha
kept
myself
long
i
lived
if
i
could
ha
held
the
place
i
parted
with
most
o
the
woodland
if
coveted
it
he
was
welcome
to
that
what
might
keep
me
in
i
always
desired
to
travel
an
see
somethin
o
the
world
but
i
got
the
chance
now
when
i
do
value
it
no
great
shrewsbury
is
a
busy
pleasant
place
i
ventured
to
say
by
way
of
comfort
though
my
heart
was
filled
with
rage
at
the
trickery
of
isaiah
peet
who
had
always
looked
like
a
fox
and
behaved
like
one
shrewsbury
held
up
for
me
to
smile
at
said
the
poor
old
soul
but
i
tell
ye
dear
it
hard
to
go
an
live
miles
from
where
you
always
had
your
home
and
friends
it
may
divert
me
but
it
wo
be
home
you
might
as
well
set
out
one
o
my
old
on
the
beach
so
could
see
the
waves
come
in
there
would
be
no
please
to
it
where
are
you
going
to
live
in
shrewsbury
i
asked
presently
i
do
expect
to
stop
long
dear
creatur
i
year
old
and
peet
turned
to
look
at
me
with
pathetic
amusement
in
her
honest
wrinkled
face
i
said
right
out
to
before
a
roomful
o
the
neighbors
that
i
expected
it
of
him
to
git
me
home
bury
me
when
my
time
come
and
do
it
respectable
but
i
wanted
to
airn
my
livin
if
was
so
i
could
till
then
he
made
sly
talk
you
see
about
my
electin
to
leave
the
farm
and
go
some
o
my
own
folks
but
and
she
whispered
this
carefully
he
did
give
me
no
chance
to
stay
there
without
hurtin
my
pride
and
dependin
on
him
i
ai
said
that
to
many
folks
but
all
must
have
suspected
a
good
sight
on
had
money
of
though
and
they
do
like
to
do
nothin
but
take
his
part
an
be
pretty
soft
spoken
fear
it
git
to
his
ears
well
well
dear
we
let
it
be
bygones
and
not
think
of
it
no
more
but
i
saw
the
great
tears
roll
slowly
down
her
cheeks
and
she
pulled
her
bonnet
forward
impatiently
and
looked
the
other
way
there
looks
to
be
plenty
o
good
farmin
land
in
this
part
o
the
country
she
said
a
minute
later
where
be
we
now
see
them
handsome
farm
buildings
he
must
be
a
man
but
i
had
to
tell
my
companion
that
we
were
still
within
the
borders
of
the
old
town
where
we
had
both
been
born
peet
gave
a
pleased
little
laugh
like
a
girl
i
expectin
shrewsbury
to
pop
up
any
minute
feared
to
be
kerried
right
by
i
never
aboard
of
the
cars
before
but
i
so
often
thought
about
em
i
do
know
but
it
seems
natural
ai
it
jest
like
flyin
through
the
air
i
ca
catch
holt
to
see
nothin
land
and
here
my
old
cat
goin
too
and
never
mistrustin
i
ai
told
you
that
i
fetched
her
is
she
in
that
basket
i
inquired
with
interest
yis
dear
truth
was
i
calculated
to
have
her
put
out
o
the
misery
o
movin
an
spoke
to
one
o
the
barnes
boys
an
he
promised
me
all
fair
but
he
there
in
season
an
i
kind
o
made
excuse
to
myself
to
fetch
her
along
she
an
old
creatur
like
me
an
i
can
make
shift
to
keep
her
some
way
or
there
probably
mice
where
we
goin
an
she
a
proper
mouser
that
can
about
keep
herself
if
there
any
sort
o
chance
will
be
somethin
o
home
to
see
her
goin
an
comin
but
i
expect
we
both
on
us
goin
to
miss
our
old
haunts
i
love
to
know
what
kind
o
mousin
there
goin
to
be
for
me
you
must
worry
i
answered
with
all
the
bravery
and
assurance
that
i
could
muster
your
niece
will
be
thankful
to
have
you
with
her
is
she
one
of
winn
daughters
oh
no
they
ai
able
it
sister
wayland
darter
isabella
that
married
the
overseer
of
the
i
ai
seen
her
since
just
after
she
was
married
but
i
turned
to
her
first
because
i
knew
she
was
best
able
to
have
me
and
then
i
can
see
just
how
the
other
girls
is
situated
and
make
me
some
kind
of
a
plot
i
wrote
to
isabella
though
she
ambitious
and
said
was
so
i
got
to
ask
to
come
an
make
her
a
visit
an
she
wrote
back
she
would
be
glad
to
have
me
but
she
did
write
right
off
and
her
letter
was
scented
up
dreadful
strong
with
some
sort
o
essence
and
i
do
feel
heartened
about
no
great
of
a
welcome
but
there
i
got
eyes
an
i
can
see
is
when
i
git
is
sister
winn
gals
married
an
they
always
boarded
an
worked
in
the
shop
on
trimmin
isabella
s
well
off
she
had
some
means
from
her
sister
i
thought
it
all
over
by
night
an
day
an
i
recalled
that
our
folks
kept
sister
wayland
folks
all
one
winter
when
he
failed
up
and
got
into
trouble
i
reckonin
on
sendin
over
gittin
the
winn
gals
to
come
and
see
me
and
advise
perhaps
some
on
may
know
of
somebody
that
take
me
for
what
help
i
can
give
about
house
or
some
clever
folks
that
have
been
lookin
for
a
smart
cat
any
ways
no
i
do
know
i
could
let
her
go
to
strangers
there
was
two
or
three
o
the
folks
round
home
that
acted
real
towards
me
an
urged
me
to
come
an
winter
with
continued
the
exile
an
this
mornin
i
wished
i
agreed
to
was
so
hard
to
break
away
but
now
it
done
i
feel
more
ever
best
i
could
bear
to
live
right
in
sight
o
the
old
place
and
come
spring
i
should
of
nothing
ondertakes
to
do
with
the
land
oh
dear
sakes
now
it
comes
hard
with
me
not
to
have
had
no
when
i
was
young
an
workin
hard
and
into
everything
i
felt
kind
of
free
an
superior
to
them
that
was
so
blessed
an
their
houses
cluttered
up
from
mornin
till
night
but
i
tell
ye
it
comes
home
to
me
now
i
be
most
willin
to
own
to
even
mean
he
is
but
i
tell
ye
i
took
it
out
of
him
he
was
a
grown
man
if
there
any
virtue
in
of
him
folks
do
look
like
wild
creator
for
nothin
got
fox
blood
in
him
is
his
misfortune
his
own
mother
always
favored
the
looks
of
an
old
fox
true
the
world
she
was
a
poor
tool
a
poor
tool
i
d
know
we
ought
to
blame
him
same
we
do
i
always
been
a
master
proud
woman
if
i
was
riz
among
the
pastures
peet
added
half
to
herself
there
was
no
use
in
saying
much
to
her
she
was
conscious
of
little
beside
her
own
thoughts
and
the
smouldering
excitement
caused
by
this
great
crisis
in
her
simple
existence
yet
the
atmosphere
of
her
loneliness
uncertainty
and
sorrow
was
so
touching
that
after
scolding
again
at
her
nephew
treachery
and
finding
the
tears
come
fast
to
my
eyes
as
she
talked
i
looked
intently
out
of
the
car
window
and
tried
to
think
what
could
be
done
for
the
poor
soul
she
was
one
of
the
people
and
i
hated
to
have
her
go
away
but
even
if
she
could
keep
her
home
she
would
soon
be
too
feeble
to
live
there
alone
and
some
definite
plan
must
be
made
for
her
comfort
farms
in
that
neighborhood
were
not
valuable
perhaps
through
the
agency
of
the
law
and
quite
in
secret
isaiah
peet
could
be
forced
to
give
up
his
unrighteous
claim
perhaps
too
the
winn
girls
who
were
really
no
longer
young
might
have
saved
something
and
would
come
home
again
but
it
was
easy
to
make
such
pictures
in
one
mind
and
i
must
do
what
i
could
through
other
people
for
i
was
just
leaving
home
for
a
long
time
i
wondered
sadly
about
peet
future
and
the
ambitious
isabella
and
the
favorite
sister
winn
daughters
to
whom
with
all
their
kindliness
of
heart
the
care
of
so
old
and
perhaps
so
dependent
an
aunt
might
seem
impossible
the
truth
about
life
in
shrewsbury
would
soon
be
known
more
than
half
the
short
journey
was
already
past
to
my
great
pleasure
my
now
began
to
forget
her
own
troubles
in
looking
about
her
she
was
an
alert
quickly
interested
old
soul
and
this
was
a
bit
of
neutral
ground
between
the
farm
and
shrewsbury
where
she
was
unattached
and
irresponsible
she
had
lived
through
the
last
tragic
moments
of
her
old
life
and
felt
a
certain
relief
and
shrewsbury
might
be
as
far
away
as
the
other
side
of
the
rocky
mountains
for
all
the
consciousness
she
had
of
its
real
existence
she
was
simply
a
traveler
for
the
time
being
and
began
to
comment
with
delicious
phrases
and
shrewd
understanding
of
human
nature
on
two
or
three
persons
near
us
who
attracted
her
attention
where
do
you
they
be
all
goin
she
asked
contemptuously
there
ai
none
on
but
what
looks
kind
o
respectable
warrant
they
left
work
to
home
they
ought
to
be
doin
i
knowed
if
ever
i
stopped
to
think
that
cars
was
hived
full
o
folks
run
to
an
fro
for
nothin
but
these
ca
be
quite
up
to
the
average
be
they
some
on
real
guess
they
shoved
out
o
the
last
place
an
goin
to
try
the
next
one
i
suppose
you
want
to
say
jest
see
that
flauntin
old
creatur
that
looks
like
a
stopped
clock
there
everybody
ca
be
one
goodness
even
preachers
i
was
glad
to
have
peet
amused
and
we
were
as
cheerful
as
we
could
be
for
a
few
minutes
she
said
earnestly
that
she
hoped
to
be
forgiven
for
such
talk
but
there
were
some
kinds
of
folks
in
the
cars
that
she
never
had
seen
before
but
when
the
conductor
came
to
take
her
ticket
she
relapsed
into
her
first
state
of
mind
and
was
at
a
loss
you
have
to
look
after
me
dear
when
we
get
to
shrewsbury
she
said
after
we
had
spent
some
distracted
moments
in
hunting
for
the
ticket
and
the
cat
had
almost
escaped
from
the
basket
and
the
had
become
untied
and
all
its
miscellaneous
contents
scattered
about
our
laps
and
the
floor
it
was
a
touching
collection
of
the
last
odds
and
ends
of
peet
housekeeping
some
battered
books
and
singed
holders
for
flatirons
and
the
faded
little
shoulder
shawl
that
i
had
seen
her
wear
many
a
day
about
her
bent
shoulders
there
were
her
old
tin
spilling
all
its
matches
and
a
for
brushing
up
ashes
and
her
almanac
it
was
most
pathetic
to
see
these
poor
trifles
out
of
their
places
at
last
the
ticket
was
found
in
her
woolen
glove
where
her
stiff
hand
had
grown
used
to
the
feeling
of
it
i
should
wonder
now
if
i
come
to
like
living
over
to
shrewsbury
she
insisted
turning
to
me
with
a
hopeful
eager
look
to
see
if
i
differed
you
see
wo
be
so
tough
for
me
as
if
i
always
felt
it
lurking
within
me
to
go
off
some
day
or
an
see
how
other
folks
did
things
i
do
know
but
what
the
winn
gals
have
laid
up
somethin
sufficient
for
us
to
take
a
house
with
the
little
mite
i
got
by
me
i
might
keep
house
for
us
all
o
round
in
other
folks
houses
that
i
ai
never
been
demeaned
to
but
i
dare
say
i
should
find
it
pleasant
in
some
ways
town
folks
has
got
the
upper
hand
o
country
folks
but
with
all
their
work
an
pride
they
ca
make
a
dandelion
i
do
know
the
times
when
i
set
out
to
wash
monday
mornin
an
tied
out
the
line
betwixt
the
old
tree
and
the
corner
o
the
barn
an
thought
i
be
with
the
same
kind
o
week
work
right
over
again
i
wonder
kind
o
if
i
could
git
out
of
it
noways
an
now
here
i
be
out
of
it
and
an
uprooteder
creatur
never
stood
on
the
airth
just
as
i
got
to
feel
i
had
somethin
ahead
come
that
business
there
you
know
he
never
was
a
forehanded
man
his
health
was
slim
and
he
got
discouraged
pretty
nigh
before
ever
he
begun
i
hope
he
do
know
i
turned
out
o
the
old
place
well
off
he
do
the
right
thing
by
ye
says
he
but
my
i
turned
hot
all
over
when
i
found
out
what
i
put
my
name
to
me
that
had
always
counted
a
smart
woman
i
did
undertake
to
read
it
over
but
i
could
sense
it
i
told
all
the
folks
so
when
they
laid
it
off
on
to
me
some
but
is
awful
tedious
readin
and
my
head
felt
that
day
as
if
the
works
was
gone
i
ai
goin
to
sag
on
to
nobody
she
assured
me
eagerly
as
the
train
rushed
along
i
got
more
work
in
me
now
than
folks
expects
at
my
age
i
may
be
use
to
isabella
she
got
a
family
an
i
take
right
holt
in
the
kitchen
or
with
the
little
gals
she
had
four
on
last
i
heared
isabella
was
never
one
that
liked
little
gals
i
do
know
now
but
what
they
must
be
about
grown
time
doos
slip
away
so
i
expect
i
shall
look
outlandish
to
but
there
everybody
knows
me
to
home
an
nobody
knows
me
to
shrewsbury
wo
make
a
mite
o
difference
if
i
take
holt
willin
i
hoped
as
i
looked
at
peet
that
she
would
never
be
persuaded
to
cast
off
the
gathered
brown
silk
bonnet
and
the
plain
shawl
that
she
had
worn
so
many
years
but
isabella
might
think
it
best
to
insist
upon
more
modern
fashions
peet
suggested
as
if
it
were
a
matter
of
little
consequence
that
she
had
kept
it
in
mind
to
buy
some
mourning
but
there
were
other
things
to
be
thought
of
first
and
so
she
had
let
it
go
until
winter
any
way
or
until
she
should
be
fairly
settled
in
shrewsbury
are
your
nieces
expecting
you
by
this
train
i
was
moved
to
ask
though
with
all
the
good
soul
ready
talk
and
appealing
manner
i
could
hardly
believe
that
she
was
going
to
shrewsbury
for
more
than
a
visit
it
seemed
as
if
she
must
return
to
the
worn
old
farmhouse
over
by
the
she
answered
that
one
of
the
barnes
boys
had
written
a
letter
for
her
the
day
before
and
there
was
evidently
little
uneasiness
about
her
first
reception
we
drew
near
the
junction
where
i
must
leave
her
within
a
mile
of
the
town
the
cat
was
clawing
indignantly
at
the
basket
and
her
mistress
grew
as
impatient
of
the
car
she
began
to
look
very
old
and
pale
my
poor
and
said
that
she
felt
dizzy
going
so
fast
presently
the
friendly
young
brakeman
came
along
bringing
the
and
other
possessions
and
insisted
upon
taking
the
alarmed
cat
beside
in
spite
of
an
aggressive
paw
that
had
worked
its
way
through
the
wicker
prison
peet
watched
her
goods
disappear
with
suspicious
eyes
and
clutched
her
as
if
it
might
be
all
that
she
could
save
then
she
anxiously
got
to
her
feet
much
too
soon
and
when
i
said
to
her
at
the
car
door
she
was
ready
to
cry
i
pointed
to
the
car
which
she
was
to
take
next
on
the
branch
line
of
railway
and
i
assured
her
that
it
was
only
a
few
minutes
ride
to
shrewsbury
and
that
i
felt
certain
she
would
find
somebody
waiting
the
sight
of
that
worn
thin
figure
adventuring
alone
across
the
platform
gave
my
heart
a
sharp
pang
as
the
train
carried
me
away
some
of
the
passengers
who
sat
near
asked
me
about
my
old
friend
with
great
sympathy
after
she
had
gone
there
was
a
look
of
tragedy
about
her
and
indeed
it
had
been
impossible
not
to
get
a
good
deal
of
her
history
as
she
talked
straight
on
in
the
same
tone
when
we
stopped
at
a
station
as
if
the
train
were
going
at
full
speed
and
some
of
her
remarks
caused
pity
and
amusements
by
turns
at
the
last
minute
she
said
with
deep
why
i
have
asked
a
word
about
your
folks
but
you
ought
to
excuse
such
an
old
stray
hen
as
i
be
in
the
spring
i
was
driving
by
on
what
the
old
people
of
my
native
town
call
the
road
and
the
sight
of
peet
former
home
brought
our
former
journey
freshly
to
my
mind
i
had
last
heard
from
her
just
after
she
got
to
shrewsbury
when
she
had
sent
me
a
message
have
you
ever
heard
how
she
got
on
i
eagerly
asked
my
companion
did
i
tell
you
that
i
met
her
in
shrewsbury
high
street
one
day
i
was
answered
she
seemed
perfectly
delighted
with
everything
her
nieces
have
laid
up
a
good
bit
of
money
and
are
soon
to
leave
the
mill
and
most
thankful
to
have
old
peet
with
them
somebody
told
me
that
they
wished
to
buy
the
farm
here
and
come
back
to
live
but
she
would
hear
of
it
and
thought
they
would
miss
too
many
privileges
she
has
been
going
to
concerts
and
lectures
this
winter
and
insists
that
isaiah
did
her
a
good
turn
we
both
laughed
my
own
heart
was
filled
with
joy
for
the
uncertain
lonely
face
of
this
homeless
old
woman
had
often
haunted
me
the
little
house
did
certainly
look
dreary
and
a
whole
lifetime
of
patient
toil
had
left
few
traces
the
tree
was
in
full
bloom
however
and
gave
a
welcome
gayety
to
the
deserted
a
little
way
beyond
we
met
isaiah
peet
the
prosperous
who
had
cheated
the
old
woman
of
her
own
i
fancied
that
he
looked
somewhat
ashamed
as
he
recognized
us
to
my
surprise
he
stopped
his
horse
in
most
social
fashion
old
aunt
peet
passed
away
he
informed
me
briskly
she
had
a
shock
and
went
right
off
sudden
yisterday
forenoon
i
about
now
tendin
to
the
funeral
she
extry
smart
they
say
all
winter
out
to
meetin
last
sabbath
never
enjoyed
herself
so
complete
as
she
has
this
past
month
she
a
very
woman
her
folks
was
glad
to
have
her
there
and
give
her
every
attention
the
place
here
never
was
good
for
nothin
the
old
uncle
you
know
he
wore
hisself
out
tryin
to
make
a
livin
off
from
it
there
was
an
ostentatious
sympathy
and
excitement
from
bad
news
which
were
quite
lost
upon
us
and
we
did
not
linger
to
hear
much
more
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
i
had
known
peet
better
than
any
one
else
had
known
her
i
had
counted
upon
seeing
her
again
and
hearing
her
own
account
of
shrewsbury
life
its
pleasures
and
its
limitations
i
wondered
what
had
become
of
the
cat
and
the
contents
of
the
faded
the
taking
of
captain
ball
i
there
was
a
natural
disinclination
to
the
cares
of
housekeeping
in
the
mind
of
captain
ball
and
he
would
have
left
the
sea
much
earlier
in
life
if
he
had
not
liked
much
better
to
live
on
board
ship
a
man
was
his
own
master
there
and
meddlesome
neighbors
and
parsons
and
tearful
could
be
made
to
keep
their
distance
but
as
years
went
on
and
the
extremes
of
weather
produced
much
affliction
in
the
shape
of
rheumatism
this
and
the
decline
of
the
merchant
service
and
the
degeneracy
of
common
seamen
forced
captain
ball
to
come
ashore
for
good
he
regretted
that
he
could
no
longer
follow
the
sea
and
in
spite
of
many
alleviations
grumbled
at
his
hard
fate
he
might
have
been
condemned
to
an
inland
town
but
in
reality
his
house
was
within
sight
of
and
he
found
plenty
of
companionship
in
the
decayed
seaport
where
he
had
been
born
and
bred
there
were
several
retired
shipmasters
who
closely
approached
his
own
rank
and
dignity
they
all
gave
other
excuses
than
that
of
old
age
and
infirmity
for
being
out
of
business
took
a
sober
satisfaction
in
their
eleven
bitters
and
discussed
the
shipping
list
of
the
morning
paper
with
far
more
interest
than
the
political
or
general
news
of
the
other
columns
while
captain
asaph
ball
was
away
on
his
long
voyages
he
had
left
his
house
in
charge
of
an
elder
sister
who
was
joint
owner
she
was
a
grim
old
person
very
stern
in
matters
of
sectarian
opinion
and
the
captain
recognized
in
his
heart
of
hearts
that
she
alone
was
his
superior
officer
he
endeavored
to
placate
her
with
generous
offerings
of
tea
and
scarfs
and
east
indian
sweetmeats
not
to
speak
of
unnecessary
and
sometimes
very
beautiful
china
for
the
parties
that
she
never
gave
and
handsome
dress
patterns
with
which
she
scorned
to
decorate
her
sinful
shape
of
clay
she
pinched
herself
to
the
verge
of
want
in
order
to
send
large
sums
of
money
to
the
missionaries
but
she
saved
the
captain
money
for
him
against
the
time
when
his
willful
lavishness
and
improvidence
might
find
him
a
poor
man
she
was
always
looking
forward
to
the
days
when
he
would
be
aged
and
forlorn
that
burly
seafaring
brother
of
hers
she
loved
to
remind
him
of
his
latter
end
and
in
writing
her
long
letters
that
were
to
reach
him
in
foreign
ports
she
told
little
of
the
neighborhood
news
and
results
of
voyages
but
bewailed
in
page
after
page
his
sad
condition
of
impenitence
and
the
shortness
of
time
the
captain
would
rather
have
faced
a
mutinous
crew
any
day
than
his
sister
solemn
statements
of
this
sort
but
he
loyally
read
them
through
with
heavy
sighs
and
worked
himself
into
his
best
broadcloth
suit
at
least
once
while
he
lay
in
port
to
go
to
church
on
sunday
out
of
good
new
england
habit
and
respect
to
her
opinions
it
was
not
his
sister
principles
but
her
phrases
that
the
captain
failed
to
comprehend
sometimes
when
he
returned
to
his
ship
he
took
pains
to
write
a
letter
to
dear
sister
ann
and
to
casually
mention
the
fact
of
his
attendance
upon
public
worship
and
even
to
recall
the
text
and
purport
of
the
sermon
he
was
apt
to
fall
asleep
in
his
humble
place
at
the
very
back
of
the
church
and
his
report
of
the
services
would
have
puzzled
a
far
less
keen
theologian
than
miss
ann
ball
in
fact
these
poor
makeshifts
of
religious
interest
did
not
deceive
her
and
the
captain
had
an
uneasy
consciousness
that
to
use
his
own
expression
the
thicker
he
laid
on
the
words
the
quicker
she
saw
through
them
and
somehow
or
other
that
manly
straightforwardness
and
honesty
of
his
that
generosity
that
true
unselfishness
which
made
him
stick
by
his
ship
when
the
crew
had
run
away
from
a
poor
black
cook
who
was
taken
down
with
the
which
made
him
nurse
the
frightened
beggar
as
tenderly
as
a
woman
and
bring
him
back
to
life
and
send
him
packing
afterward
with
plenty
of
money
in
his
pocket
all
these
fine
traits
that
made
captain
ball
respected
in
every
port
where
his
loud
voice
and
clumsy
figure
and
bronzed
face
were
known
seemed
to
count
for
nothing
with
the
stern
sister
at
least
her
younger
brother
thought
so
but
when
a
few
years
after
he
came
ashore
for
good
she
died
and
left
him
alone
in
the
neat
old
white
house
which
his
instinctive
good
taste
and
his
father
before
him
had
made
a
museum
of
east
indian
treasures
he
found
all
his
letters
stored
away
with
loving
care
after
they
had
been
read
and
reread
into
tatters
and
among
her
papers
such
touching
expressions
of
love
and
pride
and
longing
for
his
soul
good
that
poor
captain
asaph
broke
down
altogether
and
cried
like
a
she
had
saved
every
line
of
newspaper
which
even
mentioned
his
ships
names
she
had
loved
him
deeply
in
the
repressed
new
england
fashion
that
under
a
gray
and
forbidding
crust
of
manner
like
a
chilled
lava
bed
hides
glowing
fires
of
loyalty
and
devotion
sister
ann
was
a
princess
among
housekeepers
and
for
some
time
after
her
death
the
captain
was
a
piteous
mourner
indeed
no
growing
could
be
more
shy
and
miserable
in
the
presence
of
women
than
he
though
nobody
had
a
readier
friendliness
or
more
sailor
ways
among
men
the
few
intimate
family
friends
who
came
to
his
assistance
at
the
time
of
his
sister
illness
and
death
added
untold
misery
to
the
gloomy
situation
yet
he
received
the
minister
with
outspoken
gratitude
in
spite
of
that
worthy
man
trepidation
everybody
said
that
poor
captain
ball
looked
as
if
his
heart
was
broken
i
tell
ye
i
feel
as
if
i
was
tied
in
a
bag
of
fleas
said
the
distressed
mariner
and
his
pastor
turned
away
to
cough
hoping
to
hide
the
smile
that
would
come
widders
an
old
maids
they
busier
than
the
divil
in
a
gale
o
wind
grumbled
the
captain
poor
ann
she
was
worth
every
one
of
lashed
together
and
here
you
find
me
with
a
every
way
i
try
to
steer
the
minister
was
a
man
at
any
rate
his
very
presence
was
a
protection
some
wretched
days
went
by
while
captain
ball
tried
to
keep
his
lonely
house
with
the
assistance
of
one
silas
jenkins
who
had
made
several
voyages
with
him
as
cook
but
they
soon
proved
that
the
best
of
sailors
may
make
the
worst
of
housekeepers
life
looked
darker
and
darker
and
when
one
morning
silas
inadvertently
overheated
and
warped
the
new
cooking
stove
which
had
been
the
pride
of
miss
heart
the
breakfastless
captain
dismissed
him
in
a
fit
of
blind
rage
the
captain
was
first
cross
and
then
abject
when
he
went
hungry
and
in
this
latter
stage
was
ready
to
abase
himself
enough
to
recall
widow
sparks
his
sister
lieutenant
who
lived
close
by
in
ropewalk
lane
forgetting
that
he
had
driven
her
into
calling
him
an
old
hog
two
days
after
the
funeral
he
groaned
aloud
as
he
thought
of
her
but
reached
for
his
hat
and
cane
when
there
came
a
gentle
feminine
rap
at
the
door
let
knock
grumbled
the
captain
angrily
but
after
a
reflection
he
scowled
and
went
and
lifted
the
latch
there
stood
upon
the
doorstep
a
woman
with
a
pleasant
though
determined
face
the
captain
scowled
again
but
involuntarily
opened
his
a
little
wider
asaph
ball
i
presume
the
same
answered
the
captain
i
been
told
sir
that
you
need
a
housekeeper
owing
to
recent
affliction
there
was
a
squally
moment
of
resistance
in
the
old
sailor
breast
but
circumstances
seemed
to
be
wrecking
him
on
a
lee
shore
down
came
his
flag
on
the
run
i
ca
say
but
what
i
do
and
with
lofty
courtesy
such
as
an
admiral
should
use
to
his
foe
of
equal
rank
the
master
of
the
house
signified
that
his
guest
might
enter
when
they
were
seated
opposite
each
other
in
the
desolate
he
felt
himself
the
weaker
human
being
of
the
two
five
years
earlier
and
he
would
have
put
to
sea
before
the
week
end
if
only
to
gain
the
poor
freedom
of
a
coastwise
lime
schooner
well
speak
up
ca
ye
he
said
trying
to
laugh
tell
me
the
tax
and
how
much
you
can
take
hold
and
do
without
coming
to
me
for
orders
every
hand
turn
o
the
day
i
had
silas
jinkins
here
one
o
my
old
ship
cooks
he
served
well
at
sea
and
i
thought
he
had
some
head
but
we
been
beat
i
tell
ye
and
you
find
some
work
to
put
things
he
gitting
in
years
that
the
trouble
i
ought
to
have
called
on
him
said
captain
ball
anxious
to
maintain
even
so
poorly
the
dignity
of
his
sex
i
like
your
looks
you
seem
a
good
steady
hand
with
no
nonsense
about
ye
he
cast
a
shy
glance
at
his
companion
and
would
not
have
believed
that
any
woman
could
have
come
to
the
house
a
stranger
and
have
given
him
such
an
immediate
feeling
of
confidence
and
relief
i
tell
ye
what
about
the
worst
of
the
matter
and
the
captain
pulled
a
letter
out
of
his
deep
coat
pocket
his
feelings
had
been
pent
up
too
long
at
the
sight
of
the
pretty
handwriting
and
aggravatingly
sentences
asaph
ball
was
forced
to
inconsiderate
speech
the
housekeeper
pushed
back
her
as
he
began
and
tucked
her
feet
under
beside
settling
her
bonnet
a
little
as
if
she
were
and
anchored
to
ride
out
the
gale
i
in
most
need
of
an
able
person
he
roared
on
account
of
this
letter
settin
me
adrift
about
knowing
what
to
do
is
from
a
gal
that
wants
to
come
and
make
her
home
here
land
sakes
alive
puts
herself
right
forrard
i
do
want
her
i
wo
have
she
may
be
a
i
do
say
she
ai
but
what
should
i
do
with
one
o
them
jiggetin
gals
about
in
the
name
o
reason
why
should
i
be
set
out
o
my
course
i
left
at
the
mercy
o
you
and
the
captain
got
stiffly
to
his
feet
if
you
had
experience
an
think
you
can
do
for
me
why
stop
an
try
an
i
be
much
obleeged
to
ye
you
find
me
a
good
provider
and
we
let
one
another
alone
and
get
along
some
way
or
the
captain
voice
fairly
broke
he
had
been
speaking
as
if
to
a
brother
man
he
was
tired
out
and
perplexed
his
sister
ann
had
saved
him
so
many
petty
trials
and
now
she
was
gone
the
poor
man
had
watched
her
suffer
and
seen
her
die
and
he
was
as
and
as
lonely
as
a
child
however
he
might
bluster
even
such
infrequent
matters
as
family
letters
had
been
left
to
his
busy
sister
it
happened
that
they
had
inherited
a
feud
with
an
elder
family
in
the
west
though
the
captain
was
well
aware
of
the
existence
of
this
who
had
been
craftily
named
for
miss
ann
ball
and
so
gained
a
precarious
hold
on
her
affections
but
to
harbor
one
of
the
race
was
to
consent
to
the
whole
captain
ball
was
not
a
man
to
bring
down
upon
himself
an
army
of
interferers
and
plunderers
and
he
now
threw
down
the
poor
girl
letter
with
an
outrageous
expression
of
his
feelings
then
he
felt
a
silly
weakness
and
hastened
to
wipe
his
eyes
with
his
i
been
beat
i
tell
ye
he
said
brokenly
there
was
a
look
of
apparent
sympathy
mingled
with
victory
on
the
housekeeper
face
perhaps
she
had
known
some
other
old
sailor
of
the
same
make
for
she
rose
and
turned
her
face
aside
to
look
out
of
the
window
until
the
captain
long
upper
lip
had
time
to
draw
itself
straight
and
stern
again
plainly
she
was
a
woman
of
experience
and
discretion
i
take
my
shawl
and
bunnit
right
off
sir
she
said
in
a
considerate
little
voice
i
see
to
do
there
be
time
enough
after
i
get
you
your
dinner
to
see
to
havin
my
trunk
here
but
it
need
stay
a
day
longer
than
you
give
the
word
that
clever
said
the
captain
i
step
right
down
street
and
get
us
a
good
fish
an
you
can
fry
it
or
make
us
a
chowder
just
which
you
see
fit
it
now
wants
a
little
of
eleven
and
an
air
of
pleased
anticipation
lighted
his
face
i
must
be
on
my
way
if
it
all
the
same
to
you
i
guess
we
do
want
no
company
till
we
get
to
rights
a
little
you
kind
of
tired
out
sir
said
the
housekeeper
feelingly
you
can
have
the
young
girl
come
an
make
you
a
visit
and
either
let
her
go
or
keep
her
as
seems
fit
i
may
not
turn
out
to
suit
what
may
i
call
you
inquired
captain
ball
mis
french
not
one
o
them
fleet
street
frenches
suspiciously
oh
come
from
massachusetts
way
with
relief
i
was
stopping
with
some
friends
that
had
a
letter
from
some
o
the
minister
folks
here
and
they
told
how
bad
off
you
was
said
french
modestly
i
was
out
of
employment
an
i
said
to
myself
that
i
should
feel
real
happy
to
go
and
do
for
that
captain
ball
he
knows
what
he
wants
and
i
know
what
i
want
and
no
flummery
you
know
somethin
o
life
i
do
declare
and
the
captain
fairly
beamed
i
never
was
called
a
hard
man
at
sea
but
i
like
to
give
my
orders
and
have
folks
foller
if
it
was
that
wrote
they
may
have
set
me
forth
more
ordinary
i
had
every
widder
and
single
woman
in
town
here
while
ann
lay
dead
and
my
natural
were
all
worked
up
i
see
dressed
up
and
smirkin
and
their
nets
to
ketch
me
when
i
was
in
an
extremity
i
would
give
a
kentle
o
fish
for
the
whole
on
i
ai
a
marryin
man
there
once
for
all
for
ye
and
the
old
sailor
stepped
toward
the
door
with
some
temper
ef
you
write
to
the
young
woman
sir
just
to
put
off
comin
for
a
couple
or
three
weeks
suggested
french
afternoon
said
the
captain
as
if
it
were
the
ay
ay
sir
of
an
able
seaman
who
sprang
to
his
duty
of
reefing
the
captain
ball
walked
down
to
the
fish
shop
with
stately
steps
and
measured
taps
of
his
heavy
cane
he
stopped
on
the
way
a
little
belated
and
assured
two
or
three
retired
that
he
had
manned
the
old
brig
complete
at
last
he
even
gave
a
handsome
wink
of
his
left
eye
over
the
edge
of
a
glass
and
pronounced
his
morning
grog
to
be
a
no
prime
french
picked
up
her
gown
at
each
side
with
thumb
and
finger
and
swept
the
captain
a
low
courtesy
behind
his
back
as
he
went
away
then
she
turned
up
the
aforesaid
gown
and
sought
for
one
of
the
lamented
miss
ann
ball
calico
aprons
and
if
ever
a
new
england
woman
did
a
morning
work
in
an
hour
it
was
this
same
french
ai
every
one
knows
how
to
make
what
i
call
a
chowder
said
the
captain
pleased
and
replete
as
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
after
dinner
mis
french
you
shall
have
everything
to
do
with
an
i
ai
no
kitchen
colonel
myself
to
bother
ye
there
was
a
new
subject
for
gossip
in
that
seaport
town
more
than
one
woman
had
felt
herself
to
be
a
fitting
helpmate
for
the
captain
and
was
confident
that
if
time
had
been
allowed
she
could
have
made
sure
of
even
such
wary
game
as
he
when
a
stranger
stepped
in
and
occupied
the
ground
at
once
it
gave
nobody
a
fair
chance
and
french
was
recognized
as
a
presuming
adventuress
by
all
disappointed
aspirants
for
the
captain
hand
the
captain
was
afraid
at
times
that
french
carried
almost
too
many
guns
but
she
made
him
so
comfortable
that
she
kept
the
upper
hand
and
at
last
he
was
conscious
of
little
objection
to
whatever
this
able
housekeeper
proposed
her
only
intimate
friends
were
the
minister
and
his
wife
and
the
captain
himself
was
so
won
over
to
familiarity
by
the
kindness
of
his
pastor
in
the
time
of
affliction
that
when
after
some
weeks
french
invited
the
good
people
to
tea
captain
ball
sat
manfully
at
the
foot
of
his
table
and
listened
with
no
small
pleasure
to
the
delighted
exclamations
of
the
parson
wife
over
his
store
of
china
and
glass
there
was
a
little
feeling
of
guilt
when
he
remembered
how
many
times
in
his
sister
day
he
had
evaded
such
pleasant
social
occasions
by
complaint
of
inward
malady
or
by
staying
boldly
among
the
wharves
until
long
past
and
forcing
good
miss
ann
to
as
many
anxious
excuses
as
if
her
brother
cranky
ways
were
not
as
well
known
to
the
guests
as
to
herself
ii
captain
topliff
and
miss
miranda
hull
were
sitting
together
one
late
summer
afternoon
in
topliff
south
chamber
they
were
at
work
upon
a
black
dress
which
was
to
be
made
over
and
each
sat
by
a
front
window
with
the
blinds
carefully
set
ajar
this
is
a
real
handy
room
to
sew
in
said
miranda
who
had
come
early
after
dinner
for
a
good
long
afternoon
you
git
the
light
as
long
as
there
is
any
and
i
do
like
a
straw
carpet
i
do
feel
if
i
made
so
much
work
scatterin
pieces
do
you
have
no
concern
about
pieces
answered
topliff
amiably
i
was
precious
glad
to
get
you
right
on
the
sudden
so
you
see
i
counted
on
my
other
dress
lasting
me
till
winter
and
sort
of
put
this
by
to
do
at
a
leisure
time
i
knew
fit
to
wear
as
was
anyway
i
done
dealin
with
stover
he
told
me
lookin
me
right
in
the
eye
that
it
was
as
good
a
wearin
piece
o
goods
as
he
had
in
the
store
was
a
real
cheat
you
can
put
your
finger
right
through
it
you
got
some
wear
but
of
it
ventured
miranda
meekly
bending
over
her
work
i
made
it
up
quite
a
spell
ago
i
know
six
or
seven
years
ai
it
mis
topliff
yes
to
be
sure
replied
topliff
with
suppressed
indignation
but
this
we
to
work
on
i
had
before
the
centennial
i
know
i
would
take
it
to
philadelphy
because
was
too
good
an
the
first
two
or
three
years
of
a
dress
do
count
you
know
how
is
you
just
wear
to
meetin
a
pleasant
sunday
or
to
a
funeral
an
keep
in
a
safe
cluset
meanwhiles
goods
do
wear
as
used
to
agreed
miranda
but
is
all
the
better
for
my
trade
land
there
some
dresses
in
this
town
i
sick
o
bein
called
on
to
make
good
new
now
i
call
you
reasonable
about
such
things
but
there
some
i
could
name
miss
hull
at
this
point
put
several
pins
into
her
mouth
as
if
to
guard
a
secret
topliff
looked
up
with
interest
i
always
thought
ann
ball
was
the
meanest
woman
about
such
expense
she
always
looked
respectable
too
and
i
she
said
the
heathen
was
gittin
the
good
o
what
she
saved
she
must
have
given
away
hundreds
o
dollars
in
that
direction
she
left
plenty
too
and
i
asaph
mis
french
will
get
the
good
of
it
now
said
miranda
through
the
pins
seems
to
me
gittin
caught
in
spite
of
himself
old
vain
creatur
he
seemed
to
think
all
the
in
town
was
in
love
with
him
some
was
answered
topliff
i
think
any
woman
that
needed
a
home
would
naturally
think
was
a
good
chance
she
thought
that
miranda
had
indulged
high
hopes
but
wished
to
ignore
them
now
some
that
had
a
home
seemed
inclined
to
bestow
their
affections
i
observed
retorted
the
dressmaker
who
had
lost
her
little
property
by
unfortunate
investment
but
would
not
be
called
homeless
by
topliff
everybody
knew
that
the
widow
had
set
herself
down
valiantly
to
besiege
the
enemy
but
after
this
passage
at
arms
between
the
friends
they
went
on
amiably
with
their
conversation
seems
to
me
the
minister
and
mis
calvinn
are
dreadful
intimate
at
the
i
wonder
if
the
goin
to
give
as
much
to
the
heathen
as
his
sister
did
said
topliff
presently
i
understood
he
told
the
minister
that
none
o
the
heathen
was
wuth
it
that
ever
he
see
replied
miranda
in
a
pinless
voice
at
last
calvinn
only
laughed
he
knows
the
ways
but
i
thought
asaph
ball
would
have
let
his
hired
help
set
out
and
ask
company
to
tea
just
four
weeks
from
the
day
his
only
sister
was
laid
away
feelin
that
mis
french
wanted
to
get
the
minister
folks
to
back
her
up
do
you
understand
was
topliff
comment
i
should
think
the
calvinns
would
want
to
be
so
free
and
easy
with
a
woman
from
nobody
knows
where
she
runs
in
and
out
o
the
parsonage
any
time
o
day
as
ann
ball
never
took
it
upon
her
to
do
ann
liked
mis
calvinn
but
she
always
had
to
go
through
with
just
so
much
and
be
formal
with
everybody
i
tell
you
something
that
exasperated
confided
the
disappointed
miranda
that
night
they
was
there
to
tea
mis
calvinn
was
praising
up
a
handsome
flowered
china
bowl
that
was
on
the
table
with
some
new
kind
of
a
fancy
jelly
in
it
and
the
told
her
to
take
it
along
when
she
went
home
if
she
wanted
to
speakin
right
out
thoughtless
as
men
do
and
that
mis
french
chirped
up
glad
you
ought
to
have
somethin
to
remember
the
sister
by
says
she
ca
you
hear
just
how
up
an
comin
it
was
i
can

said
topliff
i
see
that
bowl
myself
on
miss
calvinn
when

a
call

wondered

it
is
an
elegant
bowl

must
have
set
the
world
by
it
poor
thing
wonder
if

to
give
remembrances
to
those
that
knew
his
sister
ever
since
they
can
remember
mirandy
hull
that
mis
french
is
a
fox
was
widow
sparks
gave
me
the
particulars
continued
topliff
she
declared
at
first
that
never
would
she
step
foot
inside
his
doors
again
but
i
always
thought
the
put
up
with
a
good
deal
her
husband
havin
been
killed
in
one
o
his
ships
by
a
fall
when
he
was
full
o
liquor
and
her
bein
there
so
much
to
help
ann
and
their
havin
provided
for
her
all
these
years
one
way
an
another
give
her
the
right
to
undertake
the
housekeepin
and
direction
everything
soon
as
ann
died
she
dressed
up
as
if
was
for
meetin
and
the
front
door
and
saw
the
folks
that
came
you
thought
she
was
of
everything
and
to
hear
her
talk
up
to
the
i
thought
i
should
die
o
laughing
when
he
blowed
out
at
her
you
know
how
he
gives
them
great
whoos
when
he
put
about
below
ye
till
your
watch
called
says
he
same
was
aboard
ship
but
there
everybody
knew
he
was
all
broke
down
and
everything
tried
him
but
to
see
her
flounce
out
o
that
back
door
was
the
evenin
after
the
funeral
miranda
said
presently
i
was
there
too
you
may
seeing
what
i
could
do
the
thought
i
was
the
proper
one
to
look
after
her
things
and
guard
against
moths
he
said
there
no
haste
but
i
knew
better
told
him
i
brought
some
camphire
right
with
me
well
did
you
git
anything
further
out
o
mis
sparks
that
french
woman
made
all
up
with
her
and
mis
sparks
swallowed
her
resentment
she
a
ignorant
kind
o
woman
an
she
needed
the
money
bad
answered
topliff
if
you
never
repeat
i
tell
you
somethin
that
make
your
eyes
stick
out
miranda
miranda
promised
and
filled
her
mouth
with
pins
preparatory
to
proper
silence
you
know
the
balls
had
a
that
went
off
out
west
somewhere
in
new
york
state
years
ago
i
do
remember
him
but
he
brought
up
a
family
and
some
of
came
here
an
made
visits
ann
used
to
get
letters
from
sometimes
she
told
me
and
i
dare
say
used
to
do
for
well
mis
sparks
says
that
there
was
a
smart
young
miss
ball
niece
or
o
the
wrote
on
and
wanted
to
come
an
live
with
him
for
the
sake
o
the
home
his
own
blood
and
kin
you
see
and
very
needy
and
mis
sparks
heard
talk
about
her
and
that
wicked
low
offscourin
has
got
round
asaph
ball
till
he
consented
to
put
the
pore
girl
off
you
see
she
wants
to
contrive
time
to
make
him
marry
her
and
then
she
do
as
she
pleases
about
his
folks
now
ai
it
a
shame
when
i
see
her
parade
up
the
broad
aisle
i
want
to
stick
out
my
tongue
at
her
i
do
so
right
in
meetin
if
the
goin
to
have
a
shock
within
a
year
i
could
wish
it
might
be
soon
to
disappoint
such
a
woman
who
is
she
anyway
she
makes
me
think
o
some
bird
pouncin
down
on
us
right
out
o
the
air
topliff
sniffed
and
jerked
about
in
her
chair
having
worked
herself
into
a
fine
fit
of
temper
there
ai
no
up
nor
down
to
this
material
is
there
inquired
miranda
meekly
she
was
thinking
that
if
she
were
as
well
off
as
topliff
and
toward
seventy
years
of
age
she
would
never
show
a
matrimonial
disappointment
in
this
open
way
it
was
ridiculous
for
a
woman
who
had
any
respect
for
herself
and
for
the
opinion
of
society
miranda
had
much
more
dignity
and
tried
to
cool
off
warmth
by
discussion
of
the
black
gown
ai
pleasant
to
have
such
a
character
among
us
do
you
think
it
is
mirandy
asked
topliff
after
a
few
minutes
of
silence
she
a
person
but
with
something
sly
about
her
i
do
mean
to
call
on
her
again
until
she
accounts
for
herself
nearer
than
any
of
ann
friends
i
thought
there
would
be
a
good
many
ways
i
could
oblige
the
if
he
grant
the
opportunity
but
ai
so
to
be
now
topliff
was
such
an
man
that
i
take
time
to
remember
others
is
made
different
miranda
smiled
her
companion
had
suffered
many
things
from
a
most
trying
husband
it
was
difficult
to
see
why
she
was
willing
to
risk
her
peace
of
mind
again
asaph
looks
now
as
meek
as
moses
she
suggested
as
she
pared
a
newly
basted
seam
with
her
creaking
scissors
mis
french
whoever
she
may
be
has
got
him
right
under
her
thumb
i
for
one
believe
she
never
get
him
for
all
her
pains
he
as
sharp
as
she
is
any
day
when
it
comes
to
that
but
he
made
comfortable
and
she
starches
his
shirt
bosoms
so
you
can
hear
creak
across
the
i
was
in
there
the
other
night
she
wanted
to
see
me
about
some
work
and
was
neat
as
wax
and
an
awful
good
scent
somethin
they
had
for
supper
that
kind
always
smart
enough
granted
the
widow
topliff
i
want
to
know
if
she
cooks
him
a
hot
supper
every
night
well
she
catch
him
if
anybody
can
why
do
you
get
a
look
into
some
o
the
clusets
if
you
go
there
to
work
ann
was
so
formal
i
never
spoke
up
as
i
wanted
to
about
seeing
her
things
they
must
have
an
awful
sight
of
china
and
as
for
the
linen
and
so
on
that
the
and
his
father
before
him
fetched
home
from
sea
you
could
find
no
end
to
it
ann
never
made
with
much
i
hope
the
mice
ai
hivin
into
it
and
makin
their
nests
ann
was
very
particular
but
i
dare
say
it
wore
her
out
tryin
to
take
care
o
such
a
houseful
i
going
there
wednesday
said
miranda
i
spy
round
all
i
can
but
i
do
like
to
carry
news
from
one
house
to
another
i
never
was
one
to
make
trouble
would
make
my
business
more
difficult
is
i
trust
you
responded
topliff
emphatically
but
there
mirandy
you
know
you
can
trust
me
too
and
anything
you
say
goes
no
further
yes
returned
miranda
somewhat
absently
to
cut
this
the
way
you
want
it
is
going
to
give
the
folds
a
skimpy
look
i
thought
it
would
from
the
first
was
topliff
obliging
answer
iii
the
captain
could
not
believe
that
two
months
had
passed
since
his
sister
death
but
french
assured
him
one
evening
that
it
was
so
he
had
troubled
himself
very
little
about
public
opinion
though
hints
of
his
housekeeper
suspicious
character
and
abominable
intentions
had
reached
his
ears
through
more
than
one
disinterested
indeed
the
minister
and
his
wife
were
the
only
persons
among
the
old
family
friends
who
kept
up
any
sort
of
intercourse
with
french
the
ladies
of
the
parish
themselves
had
not
dared
to
asperse
her
character
to
the
gruff
captain
but
were
contented
with
ignoring
her
existence
and
setting
their
husbands
to
the
fray
why
do
you
tell
him
what
folks
think
was
a
frequent
question
but
after
a
first
venture
even
the
most
intimate
and
valiant
friends
were
sure
to
mind
their
own
business
as
the
indignant
captain
bade
them
two
of
them
had
been
partially
won
over
to
french
side
by
a
taste
of
her
good
cooking
in
fact
these
were
captain
dunn
and
captain
allister
who
at
the
eleven
rendezvous
reported
their
wives
as
absent
at
the
county
conference
and
were
promptly
bidden
to
a
chowder
dinner
by
the
independent
captain
ball
who
gloried
in
the
fact
that
neither
of
his
companions
would
dare
to
ask
a
friend
home
unexpectedly
our
hero
promised
his
guests
that
what
they
did
not
find
in
eatables
they
should
make
up
in
drinkables
and
actually
produced
a
glistening
decanter
of
madeira
that
had
made
several
voyages
in
his
father
ships
while
he
himself
was
a
boy
there
were
several
casks
and
long
rows
of
cobwebby
bottles
in
the
cellar
which
had
been
provided
against
possible
use
in
case
of
illness
but
the
captain
rarely
touched
them
though
he
went
regularly
every
morning
for
a
social
glass
of
what
he
frankly
persisted
in
calling
his
grog
the
dinner
party
proved
to
be
a
noble
occasion
and
french
won
the
esteem
of
the
three
elderly
seamen
by
her
discreet
behavior
as
well
as
by
the
flavor
of
the
chowder
they
walked
out
into
the
old
garden
when
the
feast
was
over
and
continued
their
somewhat
excited
discussion
of
the
decline
of
shipping
on
the
seats
of
the
ancient
latticed
there
french
surprised
them
by
bringing
out
a
tray
of
coffee
served
in
the
handsome
old
cups
which
the
captain
father
had
brought
home
from
france
she
was
certainly
a
woman
and
stepped
modestly
and
soberly
along
the
walk
between
the
mallows
and
marigolds
her
feminine
rivals
insisted
that
she
looked
both
bold
and
sly
but
she
minded
her
work
like
a
as
the
captain
whispered
admiringly
to
his
friends
ai
never
ascertained
where
she
came
from
last
have
ye
inquired
captain
alister
emboldened
by
the
best
madeira
and
the
of
the
occasion
i
acquainted
with
all
i
need
to
know
answered
captain
ball
shortly
but
his
face
darkened
and
when
his
guests
finished
their
coffee
they
thought
it
was
high
time
to
go
away
everybody
was
sorry
that
a
jarring
note
had
been
struck
on
so
delightful
an
occasion
but
it
could
not
be
undone
on
the
whole
the
dinner
was
an
uncommon
pleasure
and
the
host
walked
back
into
the
house
to
compliment
his
housekeeper
though
the
sting
of
his
untimely
question
expressed
itself
by
a
remark
that
they
had
made
most
too
much
of
an
matter
by
having
the
coffee
in
those
best
cups
french
laughed
will
give
something
to
talk
about
was
excellent
good
coffee
this
last
you
got
anyway
and
captain
asaph
walked
away
restored
to
a
pleased
and
cheerful
frame
of
mind
when
he
waked
up
after
a
solid
nap
french
in
her
decent
afternoon
gown
as
calm
as
if
there
had
been
no
company
to
dinner
was
just
coming
down
the
front
stairs
she
seated
herself
by
the
window
and
pretended
to
look
into
the
street
the
captain
shook
his
newspaper
at
an
invading
fly
it
was
early
september
and
flies
were
cruelly
persistent
somehow
his
nap
had
not
entirely
refreshed
him
and
he
watched
his
housekeeper
with
something
like
disapproval
i
want
to
talk
with
you
about
something
sir
said
french
she
going
to
raise
her
pay
the
captain
grumbled
to
himself
well
speak
out
ca
ye
he
said
you
know
i
been
sayin
all
along
that
you
ought
to
get
your
niece
she
my
blew
the
captain
an
i
do
know
as
i
want
her
the
awful
certainty
came
upon
him
that
those
hints
were
about
french
determination
to
marry
him
and
his
stormy
nature
rose
in
wild
revolt
ca
you
keep
your
place
and
he
gave
a
great
as
if
he
were
letting
off
superabundant
steam
she
might
prove
to
carry
too
many
guns
for
him
and
he
grew
very
red
in
the
face
it
was
a
much
worse
moment
than
when
a
vessel
comes
driving
at
you
amidships
out
of
the
fog
why
yes
sir
i
should
be
glad
to
keep
my
place
said
french
taking
the
less
grave
meaning
of
his
remark
by
instinct
if
not
by
preference
only
it
seems
your
duty
to
let
your
come
some
time
or
other
and
i
can
go
off
perhaps
it
is
an
untimely
season
to
speak
about
it
but
you
see
i
have
had
it
in
mind
and
now
i
got
through
with
the
preserves
and
there
a
space
between
now
and
i
guess
you
better
let
the
young
woman
come
folks
have
got
wind
about
your
refusing
her
earlier
and
think
hard
of
me
my
position
is
altogether
pleasant
and
she
changed
color
a
little
and
looked
him
full
in
the
face
the
captain
eyes
fell
he
did
owe
her
something
he
never
had
been
so
comfortable
in
his
life
on
shore
as
she
had
made
him
she
had
heard
some
cursed
speeches
and
he
very
well
knew
that
a
more
woman
never
lived
but
now
her
moment
of
seemed
to
have
come
and
to
use
his
own
words
she
had
him
fast
stop
there
was
a
way
of
escape
then
i
send
for
the
gal
perhaps
you
right
slept
myself
into
the
doldrums
whoo
he
said
loudly
anything
to
gain
a
little
time
anything
you
say
he
protested
i
got
to
step
on
some
business
and
the
captain
fled
with
ponderous
footsteps
out
through
the
to
the
little
side
entry
where
he
hung
his
hat
then
a
moment
later
he
went
away
clicking
his
cane
along
the
narrow
sidewalk
he
had
escaped
that
time
and
wrote
the
brief
note
to
his
ann
ball
how
familiar
the
name
looked
with
a
sense
of
victory
he
dreaded
the
next
interview
with
his
housekeeper
but
she
was
and
and
seemed
to
be
giving
him
plenty
of
time
then
the
captain
regretted
his
letter
and
felt
as
if
he
were
going
to
be
broken
up
once
more
in
his
home
comfort
he
spoke
only
when
it
was
absolutely
necessary
and
simply
nodded
his
head
when
french
said
that
she
was
ready
to
start
as
soon
as
she
showed
the
young
woman
about
the
house
but
what
favorite
dishes
were
served
the
captain
in
those
intervening
days
and
there
was
one
cool
evening
beside
when
the
housekeeper
had
the
social
assistance
of
a
fire
in
the
franklin
stove
the
captain
thought
that
his
only
safety
lay
in
sleep
and
promptly
took
that
means
of
saving
himself
from
a
dangerous
conversation
he
even
went
to
a
panorama
on
friday
night
a
diversion
that
would
usually
be
quite
beneath
his
dignity
it
was
difficult
to
avoid
asking
french
to
accompany
him
she
helped
him
on
with
his
coat
so
pleasantly
but
she
git
her
claws
on
me
comin
home
perhaps
mused
the
mariner
and
stoutly
went
his
way
to
the
panorama
alone
it
was
a
very
dull
show
indeed
and
he
bravely
confessed
it
and
then
was
angry
at
a
twinkle
in
french
eyes
yet
he
should
miss
the
good
creature
and
for
the
life
of
him
he
could
not
think
lightly
of
her
she
well
knows
how
able
she
is
to
do
for
me
is
ashore
sighed
the
captain
as
he
went
upstairs
to
bed
is
ashore
he
repeated
in
solemn
confidence
to
one
of
his
intimate
friends
as
they
stood
next
day
on
one
of
the
deserted
wharves
looking
out
across
the
empty
harbor
roads
there
was
nothing
coming
in
how
they
had
watched
the
ships
enter
between
the
outer
capes
and
drop
their
great
sails
in
home
waters
how
they
had
ruled
those
ships
and
been
the
ablest
of
their
day
with
nobody
to
question
their
decisions
there
is
no
such
absolute
monarchy
as
a
he
is
a
petty
king
indeed
as
he
sails
the
high
seas
from
port
to
port
there
was
a
fine
easterly
breeze
and
a
bright
sun
that
day
but
captain
ball
came
toiling
up
the
street
toward
his
house
as
if
he
were
vexed
by
a
headwind
he
carried
a
between
his
thumb
and
finger
and
grumbled
aloud
as
he
stumped
along
french
he
called
loudly
as
he
opened
the
door
and
that
worthy
woman
appeared
with
a
floured
apron
and
a
mind
divided
between
her
employer
special
business
and
her
own
affairs
of
she
coming
this
same
day
roared
the
captain
might
have
given
some
notice
i
sure
with
you
saturday
afternoon
and
signed
her
name
that
all
she
written
whoo
whoo
is
a
dreadful
close
day
and
the
poor
old
fellow
fumbled
for
his
big
silk
handkerchief
i
do
know
what
train
she
take
i
ai
going
to
hang
round
up
at
the
depot
my
rheumatism
troubles
me
i
would
if
i
was
you
answered
french
shortly
and
turned
from
him
with
a
pettish
movement
to
open
the
oven
door
the
captain
passed
into
the
and
sat
down
heavily
in
his
large
chair
on
the
wall
facing
him
was
a
picture
of
his
old
ship
the
ocean
rover
leaving
the
harbor
of
bristol
it
was
not
valuable
as
a
marine
painting
but
the
sea
was
blue
in
that
picture
and
the
white
canvas
all
spread
to
the
very
it
was
an
emblem
of
that
freedom
which
captain
asaph
ball
had
once
enjoyed
dinner
that
day
was
a
melancholy
meal
and
after
it
was
cleared
away
the
master
of
the
house
forlornly
watched
french
gather
an
armful
of
her
own
belongings
and
mount
the
stairs
as
if
she
were
going
to
pack
her
box
that
very
afternoon
it
did
not
seem
possible
that
she
meant
to
leave
before
monday
but
the
captain
could
not
bring
himself
to
ask
any
questions
he
was
at
the
mercy
of
womankind
a
jiggeting
girl
i
do
know
how
to
act
with
her
she
rule
me
he
muttered
to
himself
she
and
mis
french
may
think
they
got
things
right
to
their
hands
but
i
stand
my
ground
i
stand
my
ground
and
the
captain
gently
slid
into
the
calmer
waters
of
his
afternoon
nap
when
he
waked
the
house
was
still
and
with
sudden
consciousness
of
approaching
danger
and
a
fear
lest
french
might
have
some
last
words
to
say
if
she
found
him
awake
he
stole
out
of
his
house
as
softly
as
possible
and
went
hiding
his
secret
woes
and
joining
in
the
long
seafaring
reminiscences
with
which
he
and
his
friends
usually
diverted
themselves
as
he
came
up
the
street
again
toward
he
saw
that
the
blinds
were
thrown
open
in
the
parlor
windows
and
his
heart
began
to
beat
loudly
he
could
hear
women
voices
and
he
went
in
by
a
side
gate
and
sought
the
quiet
garden
it
had
suffered
from
a
touch
of
frost
so
had
the
captain
french
heard
the
gate
creak
and
presently
she
came
to
the
garden
door
at
the
end
of
the
front
entry
come
in
wo
ye
she
called
persuasively
and
with
a
mighty
sea
oath
the
captain
rose
and
obeyed
the
house
was
still
he
strode
along
the
entry
lite
a
brave
man
there
was
nothing
of
the
coward
about
asaph
ball
when
he
made
up
his
mind
to
a
thing
there
was
nobody
in
the
best
parlor
and
he
turned
toward
the
but
there
sat
smiling
french
where
is
the
gal
blew
the
captain
here
i
be
sir
said
french
with
a
flushed
and
beaming
face
i
thought
was
full
time
to
put
you
out
of
your
misery
what
all
this
mean
whoo
here
i
be
take
me
or
leave
me
uncle
answered
the
housekeeper
she
began
to
be
anxious
the
captain
looked
so
bewildered
and
irate
folks
seemed
to
think
that
you
was
peculiar
and
i
was
impressed
that
it
would
be
better
to
just
come
first
without
a
word
bein
said
and
find
out
how
you
an
me
got
on
then
if
we
did
make
out
nobody
be
bound
i
sure
i
did
want
to
be
who
was
that
i
heard
talking
with
ye
as
i
come
by
blew
the
captain
very
loud
that
was
mis
topliff
an
an
old
cat
she
is
calmly
replied
french
she
has
been
near
me
before
this
three
months
but
plenty
of
stories
she
set
goin
about
us
and
plenty
of
spyin
done
i
thought
i
tell
you
who
i
was
within
a
week
after
i
come
but
i
found
out
how
things
was
goin
and
i
had
to
spite
well
before
i
got
through
i
expected
that
something
would
turn
up
an
the
whole
story
get
out
but
we
been
middlin
comfortable
have
we
sir
an
i
thought
was
time
to
give
you
a
little
surprise
calvinn
and
the
minister
knows
the
whole
story
she
concluded
i
would
have
kep
it
from
them
mis
calvinn
said
all
along
would
be
a
good
lesson
who
wrote
that
card
from
the
demanded
the
captain
apparently
but
half
persuaded
i
did
said
french
good
hector
you
but
captain
ball
ventured
to
cross
the
room
and
establish
himself
in
his
chair
then
being
a
man
of
humor
he
saw
that
he
had
a
round
turn
on
those
who
had
spitefufly
sought
to
question
him
you
need
let
on
that
you
have
known
me
all
along
suggested
french
i
should
be
pleased
if
you
would
call
me
by
my
christian
name
sir
i
was
married
to
french
only
a
short
time
he
was
taken
away
very
sudden
the
letter
that
came
after
aunt
death
was
directed
to
my
maiden
name
but
aunt
knew
all
about
me
i
got
some
means
an
i
ai
distressed
but
what
i
can
earn
my
living
they
do
call
me
such
an
old
turk
i
hope
exclaimed
the
excited
captain
deprecating
the
underrated
estimate
of
himself
which
was
suddenly
presented
i
ai
a
hard
man
at
sea
now
i
tell
ye
and
he
turned
away
much
moved
at
the
injustice
of
society
i
got
no
head
for
geneology
ann
usually
set
in
to
give
me
the
family
particulars
when
i
was
logy
with
sleep
a
sunday
night
i
thought
you
was
a
french
from
massachusetts
way
i
had
to
say
somethin
responded
the
housekeeper
promptly
well
well
and
a
suppressed
laugh
shook
the
captain
like
an
earthquake
he
was
suddenly
set
free
from
his
enemies
while
an
hour
before
he
had
been
hemmed
in
on
every
side
they
had
a
cheerful
supper
and
ann
french
cut
a
pie
and
said
as
she
passed
him
more
than
a
quarter
part
of
it
that
she
thought
she
should
give
up
when
she
was
baking
that
morning
and
saw
the
look
on
his
face
as
he
handed
her
the
you
fit
to
be
captain
of
a
privateer
acknowledged
captain
asaph
ball
handsomely
the
complications
of
shore
life
were
very
astonishing
to
this
seafaring
man
of
the
old
school
early
on
monday
morning
he
had
a
delightful
sense
of
triumph
captain
allister
who
was
the
chief
gossip
of
the
waterside
club
took
it
upon
himself
a
cheap
thing
to
do
as
everybody
said
afterwards
to
ask
many
questions
about
those
unvalued
relatives
of
the
balls
who
had
settled
long
ago
in
new
york
state
were
there
any
children
left
of
the
captain
family
i
got
a
niece
living
a
she
is
answered
captain
ball
with
a
broad
smile
makes
me
feel
old
you
see
my
was
a
grown
man
when
i
was
born
i
never
saw
him
scarcely
there
was
some
misunderstanding
an
he
always
lived
with
his
own
mother
folks
and
father
he
married
again
and
had
me
and
ann
thirty
year
after
why
my
been
a
hundred
i
do
know
but
more
captain
ball
spoke
in
a
cheerful
tone
the
audience
meditated
and
captain
allister
mentioned
meekly
that
time
did
slip
away
ever
see
any
of
he
inquired
in
some
way
public
interest
was
aroused
in
the
niece
ever
see
any
of
repeated
the
captain
in
a
loud
tone
you
fool
allister
who
keepin
my
house
this
minute
why
ann
french
ann
ball
that
was
and
a
smart
likely
woman
she
is
i
ai
a
marryin
man
there
been
plenty
o
fools
to
try
me
i
been
picked
over
well
by
you
and
others
and
i
thought
if
pleased
you
you
could
take
your
own
time
the
honest
captain
for
once
lent
himself
to
deception
one
would
have
thought
that
he
had
planned
the
siege
himself
he
took
his
stick
from
where
it
leaned
against
a
decaying
piece
of
and
went
clicking
away
the
explanation
of
his
housekeeping
arrangements
was
not
long
in
flying
about
the
town
and
captain
topliff
made
an
early
call
to
say
that
she
had
always
suspected
it
from
the
first
from
the
family
likeness
from
this
time
captain
ball
submitted
to
the
rule
of
french
and
under
her
sensible
and
fearless
sway
became
as
everybody
said
more
like
other
people
than
ever
before
as
he
grew
older
it
was
more
and
more
convenient
to
have
a
superior
officer
to
save
him
from
petty
responsibilities
but
now
and
then
after
the
first
relief
at
finding
that
french
was
not
seeking
his
hand
in
marriage
and
that
the
jiggeting
girl
was
a
mere
fabrication
captain
ball
was
both
surprised
and
a
little
ashamed
to
discover
that
something
in
his
heart
had
suffered
disappointment
in
the
matter
of
the
those
who
knew
him
well
would
have
as
soon
expected
to
see
a
flower
grow
out
of
a
as
that
captain
asaph
ball
should
hide
such
a
sentiment
in
his
honest
breast
he
had
fancied
her
a
pretty
girl
in
a
pink
dress
who
would
make
some
life
in
the
quiet
house
and
sit
and
sing
at
her
sewing
by
the
front
window
in
all
her
foolish
furbelows
as
he
came
up
the
street
by
the
morning
boat
on
the
coast
of
maine
where
many
green
islands
and
salt
inlets
fringe
the
shore
line
where
balsam
firs
and
bayberry
bushes
send
their
fragrance
far
seaward
and
sing
all
day
and
the
tide
runs
plashing
in
and
out
among
the
weedy
ledges
where
cowbells
tinkle
on
the
hills
and
herons
stand
in
the
shady
coves
on
the
lonely
coast
of
maine
stood
a
small
gray
house
facing
the
morning
light
all
the
houses
of
that
region
face
the
sea
apprehensively
like
the
women
who
live
in
them
this
home
of
four
people
was
as
bleached
and
gray
with
wind
and
rain
as
one
of
the
pasture
rocks
close
by
there
were
some
cinnamon
rose
bushes
under
the
window
at
one
side
of
the
door
and
a
stunted
lilac
at
the
other
side
it
was
so
early
in
the
cool
morning
that
nobody
was
astir
but
some
shy
birds
that
had
come
in
the
stillness
of
dawn
to
pick
and
flutter
in
the
short
grass
they
flew
away
together
as
some
one
softly
opened
the
unlocked
door
and
stepped
out
this
was
a
bent
old
man
who
shaded
his
eyes
with
his
hand
and
looked
at
the
west
and
the
east
and
overhead
and
then
took
a
few
lame
and
feeble
steps
farther
out
to
see
a
wooden
vane
on
the
barn
then
he
sat
down
on
the
doorstep
clasped
his
hands
together
between
his
knees
and
looked
steadily
out
to
sea
scanning
the
horizon
where
some
schooners
had
held
on
their
course
all
night
with
a
light
westerly
breeze
he
seemed
to
be
satisfied
at
sight
of
the
weather
as
if
he
had
been
anxious
as
he
lay
unassured
in
his
north
bedroom
vexed
with
the
sleeplessness
of
age
and
excited
by
thoughts
of
the
coming
day
the
old
seaman
dozed
as
he
sat
on
the
doorstep
while
dawn
came
up
and
the
world
grew
bright
and
the
little
birds
returned
fearfully
at
first
to
finish
their
breakfast
and
at
last
made
bold
to
hop
close
to
his
feet
after
a
time
some
one
else
came
and
stood
in
the
open
door
behind
him
why
father
seems
to
me
you
got
an
early
start
ai
but
four
i
thought
i
was
foolish
to
get
up
so
soon
but
so
i
could
sleep
no
darter
the
old
man
smiled
as
he
turned
to
look
at
her
wide
awake
on
the
instant
ai
so
soon
as
i
git
out
some
o
these
mornin
the
birds
wake
me
up
singin
and
it
plenty
light
you
know
i
wanted
to
make
sure
would
have
a
fair
day
to
go
i
expect
he
have
to
go
if
the
weather
good
said
the
woman
yes
yes
but
is
useful
to
have
fair
weather
an
a
good
sign
some
says
it
is
this
is
a
great
event
for
the
boy
ai
it
i
ca
face
the
thought
o
losin
on
him
father
the
woman
came
forward
a
step
or
two
and
sat
down
on
the
doorstep
she
was
a
anxious
creature
whose
face
had
lost
all
look
of
youth
she
was
apt
in
the
general
course
of
things
to
hurry
the
old
man
and
to
spare
little
time
for
talking
and
he
was
pleased
by
this
acknowledged
unity
of
their
interests
he
moved
aside
a
little
to
give
her
more
room
and
glanced
at
her
with
a
smile
as
if
to
beg
her
to
speak
freely
they
were
both
undemonstrative
taciturn
new
englanders
their
hearts
were
warm
with
feeling
that
summer
morning
yet
it
was
easier
to
understand
one
another
through
silence
than
through
speech
no
i
could
git
much
sleep
repeated
the
daughter
at
last
some
things
i
thought
of
that
ai
come
to
mind
before
for
years
things
i
do
relish
the
feelin
of
all
over
again
was
just
such
a
mornin
as
this
pore
little
father
went
off
on
that
last
o
his
answered
the
old
sailor
with
instant
comprehension
yes
you
had
it
master
hard
pore
gal
ai
you
i
advised
him
against
goin
off
on
that
old
vessel
with
a
crew
that
capable
such
a
mornin
as
this
when
i
come
out
at
i
always
seem
to
see
her
over
there
beyond
the
where
she
was
to
anchor
well
i
thank
heaven
was
averse
to
goin
to
sea
declared
the
mother
there
dangers
ashore
lucy
ann
said
the
grandfather
solemnly
but
there
was
no
answer
and
they
sat
there
in
silence
until
the
old
man
grew
drowsy
again
yisterday
was
the
first
time
it
fell
onto
my
heart
that
was
goin
off
the
mother
began
again
after
a
time
had
passed
folks
was
right
about
our
needing
of
him

workin
every
way

could
to
further
him
and

and
now

we
got
to
part
with
him
i
do
see
how
to
put

insisted
the
old
man
my
mother
wept
the
night
through
before
i
was
goin
to
sail
on
my
first
she
was
kind
of
satisfied
though
when
i
come

a
full
man
with
my
savin
in
my
pocket

said
the
woman
ai
everybody

chimbleys
o

houses
without

glass
he
tried
eagerly
to
console
her
all
ready

willin
to
do
their
part
for

so
as
you

let

and
kind
o

when

lucy
ann
an
will
relish
with
his
baked
potatoes
he
think
o
his
breakfast
more
times
you
expect
i
know
a
lad
feelin
when
home
put
behind
him
the
sun
was
up
clear
and
bright
over
the
broad
sea
inlet
to
the
eastward
but
the
shining
water
struck
the
eye
by
its
look
of
vacancy
it
was
broad
daylight
and
still
so
early
that
no
sails
came
stealing
out
from
the
farmhouse
landings
or
even
from
the
gray
groups
of
battered
that
overhung
here
and
there
a
sheltered
cove
some
crows
and
gulls
were
busy
in
the
air
it
was
the
time
of
day
when
the
world
belongs
more
to
birds
than
to
men
poor
the
mother
went
on
compassionately
i
expect
it
has
been
a
long
night
to
him
he
seemed
to
take
it
in
as
he
was
goin
to
bed
how
was
his
last
night
to
home
i
heard
him
thrashin
about
kind
o
restless
sometimes
come
lucy
ann
the
boy
ought
to
be
stirrin
exclaimed
the
old
sailor
without
the
least
show
of
sympathy
he
got
to
be
ready
when
john
sykes
comes
an
he
ai
so
quick
as
some
lads
the
mother
rose
with
a
sigh
and
went
into
the
house
after
her
own
sleepless
night
she
dreaded
to
face
the
regretful
sleepless
eyes
of
her
son
but
as
she
opened
the
door
of
his
little
bedroom
there
lay
elisha
sound
asleep
and
comfortable
to
behold
she
stood
watching
him
with
gloomy
tenderness
until
he
stirred
uneasily
his
consciousness
roused
by
the
intentness
of
her
thought
and
the
mysterious
current
that
flowed
from
her
wistful
eager
eyes
but
when
the
lad
waked
it
was
to
a
joyful
sense
of
manliness
and
responsibility
for
him
the
change
of
surroundings
was
coming
through
natural
processes
of
growth
not
through
the
uprooting
which
gave
his
mother
such
an
aching
heart
a
little
later
elisha
came
out
to
the
arrayed
in
his
best
clothes
set
off
with
a
bright
blue
satin
cravat
which
had
been
the
pride
and
delight
of
pleasant
sundays
and
rare
holidays
he
already
felt
unrelated
to
the
familiar
scene
of
things
and
was
impatient
to
be
gone
for
one
thing
it
was
strange
to
sit
down
to
breakfast
in
sunday
splendor
while
his
mother
and
grandfather
and
little
sister
lydia
were
in
their
humble
attire
they
ate
in
silence
and
haste
as
they
always
did
but
with
a
new
constraint
and
awkwardness
that
forbade
their
looking
at
one
another
at
last
the
head
of
the
household
broke
the
silence
with
simple
straightforwardness
you
got
an
excellent
good
day
i
like
to
have
a
fair
start
myself
ai
goin
to
be
too
hot
the
wind
working
into
the
north
a
little
yes

responded
elisha
the
great
about
gittin
on
in
life
is
bein
able
to
cope
with
your
headwinds
continued
the
old
man
earnestly
pushing
away
his
plate
any
fool
can
run
before
a
fair
breeze
but
i
tell
ye
a
good
seaman
is
one
that

the
best
out
o
his
disadvantages

the
store
and
you

plenty
o
blows
to
your
pride
but

ahead
and

amongst
honest
folks
if

lines
for

my
boy
an
you
can
bear
your
home
in
mind
and
work
your
way
same
plenty
of
others
has
done
it
was
a
solemn
moment
the
speaker
voice
faltered
and
little
lydia
dried
her
tearful
blue
eyes
with
her
gingham
apron
elisha
hung
his
head
and
patted
the
old
spotted
cat
which
came
to
rub
herself
against
his
the
mother
rose
hastily
and
hurried
into
the
pantry
close
by
she
was
always
an
appealing
figure
with
her
thin
shoulders
and
faded
calico
gowns
it
was
difficult
to
believe
that
she
had
once
been
the
prettiest
girl
in
that
neighborhood
but
her
son
loved
her
in
his
sober
undemonstrative
way
and
was
full
of
plans
for
coming
home
rich
and
generous
enough
to
make
her
proud
and
happy
he
was
half
pleased
and
half
annoyed
because
his
was
of
such
deep
concern
to
the
household
come
lyddy
do
you
take
on
he
said
with
rough
kindliness
let
go
out
and
i
show
you
how
to
feed
the
pig
and
to
the
chickens
you
have
to
be
chief
clerk
when
i
gone
they
went
out
to
the
yard
hand
in
hand
elisha
stopped
to
stroke
the
old
cat
again
as
she
ran
by
his
side
and
mewed
i
wish
i
was
off
and
done
with
it
this
morning
does
seem
awful
long
said
the
boy
ai
you
afraid
you
be
homesick
an
want
to
come
back
asked
the
little
sister
timidly
but
elisha
scorned
so
poor
a
thought
you
have
to
see
if
grandpa
has
to
these
things
the
pig
an
the
chickens
he
advised
her
gravely
he
forgets
sometimes
when
i
away
but
he
would
be
cast
down
if
you
told
him
so
and
you
just
keep
an
eye
open
lyddy
mother
got
enough
to
do
inside
the
house
but
grandsir
keep
her
in
kindlin
he
likes
to
set
and
chop
in
the
shed
rainy
days
an
he
do
a
sight
more
if
you
set
with
him
an
let
him
get
goin
on
his
old
seafarin
times
lydia
nodded
discreetly
an
lyddy
do
you
loiter
comin
home
from
school
an
do
play
out
late
an
get
fussy
when
it
comes
cold
weather
and
you
tell
susy
draper
the
boy
voice
sounded
unconcerned
but
lydia
glanced
at
him
quickly
you
tell
susy
draper
that
i
was
awful
sorry
she
was
over
to
her
aunt
so
i
could
say
lydia
heart
was
the
heart
of
a
woman
and
she
comprehended
lydia
nodded
again
more
sagely
than
before
see
here
said
the
boy
suddenly
i
goin
to
let
my
old
woodchuck
out
lydia
face
was
blank
with
surprise
i
thought
you
promised
to
sell
him
to
big
jim
hooper
i
did
but
i
do
care
for
big
jim
hooper
you
just
tell
him
i
let
my
go
the
brother
and
sister
went
to
their
favorite
playground
between
the
ledges
not
far
from
the
small
old
barn
here
was
a
clumsy
box
with
wire
gratings
behind
which
an
untamed
little
wild
beast
sat
up
and
chittered
at
his
harmless
foes
he
a
whopping
old
fellow
said
elisha
admiringly
big
jim
hooper
have
him
and
as
he
opened
the
trap
lydia
had
hardly
time
to
perch
herself
high
on
the
ledge
before
the
woodchuck
tumbled
and
scuttled
along
the
short
green
turf
and
was
lost
among
the
clumps
of
juniper
and
bayberry
just
beyond
i
feel
just
like
him
said
the
boy
i
want
to
get
up
to
boston
just
as
bad
as
that
see
here
now
and
he
flung
a
gallant
of
himself
in
the
same
direction
and
then
stood
on
his
head
and
waved
his
legs
furiously
in
the
air
i
feel
just
like
that
lydia
who
had
been
tearful
all
the
morning
looked
at
him
in
vague
dismay
only
a
short
time
ago
she
had
never
been
made
to
feel
that
her
brother
was
so
much
older
than
herself
they
had
been
constant
playmates
but
now
he
was
like
a
grown
man
and
cared
no
longer
for
their
old
pleasures
there
was
all
possible
difference
between
them
that
there
can
be
between
fifteen
years
and
twelve
and
lydia
was
nothing
but
a
child
come
come
where
be
ye
shouted
the
old
grandfather
and
they
both
started
guiltily
elisha
rubbed
some
dry
grass
out
of
his
hair
and
the
little
sister
came
down
from
her
ledge
at
that
moment
the
real
pang
of
parting
shot
through
her
heart
her
brother
belonged
irrevocably
to
a
wider
world
stover
has
sent
for
ye
to
come
over
she
wants
to
say
to
ye
shouted
the
grandfather
leaning
on
his
two
canes
at
the
end
of
the
bam
come
step
lively
an
remember
you
ai
got
none
too
much
time
an
the
boat
ai
goin
to
wait
a
minute
for
nobody
stover
repeated
the
boy
with
a
frown
he
and
his
sister
knew
only
too
well
the
pasture
path
between
the
two
houses
stover
was
a
bedridden
woman
who
had
seen
much
trouble
a
town
charge
in
her
old
age
her
neighbors
gave
to
her
generously
out
of
their
own
slender
stores
yet
with
all
this
poverty
and
dependence
she
held
firm
sway
over
the
customs
and
opinions
of
her
acquaintance
from
the
uneasy
bed
where
she
lay
year
in
and
year
out
watching
the
far
sea
line
beyond
a
pasture
slope
the
young
people
walked
fast
sometimes
running
a
little
way
the
boy
going
ahead
and
burst
into
their
room
out
of
breath
she
was
calm
and
critical
and
their
excitement
had
a
sudden
chill
so
the
great
day
come
at
last
she
asked
at
which
was
conscious
of
unnecessary
aggravation
i
do
know
it
much
of
a
day
to
anybody
but
me
he
added
discovering
a
twinkle
in
her
black
eyes
that
was
more
sympathetic
than
usual
i
expected
to
stop
an
see
you
last
night
but
i
had
to
go
round
and
see
all
our
folks
and
when
i
got
back
was
late
and
the
tide
was
down
an
i
knew
that
grandsir
could
git
the
boat
up
all
alone
to
our
lower
landin
well
i
did
forgit
you
but
i
thought
you
might
forgit
me
an
i
goin
to
give
ye
somethin
is
for
your
folks
sake
i
want
ye
to
tell
so
i
do
want
ye
never
to
part
with
it
even
if
it
fails
to
work
and
you
git
proud
an
want
a
new
one
it
been
a
sight
o
company
to
me
she
reached
up
with
a
flush
on
her
wrinkled
cheeks
and
tears
in
her
eyes
and
took
a
worn
old
silver
watch
from
its
nail
and
handed
it
with
a
last
look
at
its
white
face
and
large
gold
hands
to
the
startled
boy
oh
i
ca
take
it
from
ye
stover
i
just
as
much
obliged
to
you
he
faltered
there
go
now
dear
go
right
along
said
the
old
woman
turning
quickly
away
be
a
good
boy
for
your
folks
sake
if
so
be
that
here
when
you
come
home
you
can
let
me
see
how
well
you
kep
it
the
boy
and
girl
went
softly
out
leaving
the
door
wide
open
as
stover
liked
to
have
it
in
summer
weather
her
windows
being
small
and
few
there
were
neighbors
near
enough
to
come
and
shut
it
if
a
heavy
shower
blew
up
sometimes
the
song
sparrows
and
whippoorwills
came
hopping
in
about
the
little
bare
room
i
felt
kind
to
carry
off
her
watch
protested
elisha
with
a
radiant
face
that
belied
his
honest
words
put
it
on
said
proud
little
lydia
trotting
alongside
and
he
hooked
the
bright
steel
chain
into
his
buttonhole
and
looked
down
to
see
how
it
shone
across
his
waistcoat
none
of
his
friends
had
so
fine
a
watch
even
his
grandfather
was
so
poor
a
timekeeper
that
it
was
rarely
worn
except
as
a
decoration
on
sundays
or
at
a
funeral
they
hurried
home
stover
lying
in
her
bed
could
see
the
two
slight
figures
nearly
all
the
way
on
the
pasture
path
flitting
along
in
their
joyful
haste
it
was
disappointing
that
the
mother
and
grandfather
had
so
little
to
say
about
the
watch
in
fact
elisha
grandfather
only
said
pore
creatur
once
or
twice
and
turned
away
rubbing
his
eyes
with
the
back
of
his
hand
if
stover
had
chosen
to
give
so
rich
a
gift
to
know
the
joy
of
such
generosity
nobody
had
a
right
to
protest
yet
nobody
knew
how
much
the
poor
wakeful
soul
would
miss
the
only
one
of
her
meagre
possessions
that
seemed
alive
and
companionable
in
lonely
hours
somebody
had
said
once
that
there
were
chairs
that
went
about
on
wheels
made
on
purpose
for
crippled
persons
like
stover
and
elisha
heart
was
instantly
filled
with
delight
at
the
remembrance
perhaps
before
long
if
he
could
save
some
money
and
get
ahead
he
would
buy
one
of
those
chairs
and
send
it
down
from
boston
and
a
new
sense
of
power
filled
his
honest
heart
he
had
dreamed
a
great
many
dreams
already
of
what
he
meant
to
do
with
all
his
money
when
he
came
home
rich
and
a
person
of
consequence
in
summer
vacations
the
large
leather
valise
was
soon
packed
and
its
owner
carried
it
out
to
the
roadside
and
put
his
last
winter
overcoat
and
a
great
new
umbrella
beside
it
so
as
to
be
ready
when
john
sykes
came
with
the
wagon
he
was
more
and
more
anxious
to
be
gone
and
felt
no
sense
of
his
old
identification
with
the
home
interests
his
mother
said
sadly
that
he
would
be
gone
full
soon
enough
when
he
joined
his
grandfather
in
accusing
sykes
of
keeping
them
waiting
forever
and
making
him
miss
the
boat
there
were
three
rough
roundabout
miles
to
be
traveled
to
the
steamer
landing
and
the
sykes
horses
were
known
to
be
slow
but
at
last
the
team
came
nodding
in
sight
over
a
steep
hill
in
the
road
then
the
moment
of
parting
had
come
the
moment
toward
which
all
the
long
late
winter
and
early
summer
had
looked
the
boy
was
leaving
his
plain
little
home
for
the
great
adventure
of
his
life
fortunes
until
then
he
had
been
the
charge
and
anxiety
of
his
elders
and
under
their
rule
and
advice
now
he
was
free
to
choose
his
was
the
power
of
direction
his
the
responsibility
for
in
the
world
one
must
be
ranked
by
his
own
character
and
ability
and
doomed
by
his
own
failures
the
boy
lifted
his
burden
lightly
and
turned
with
an
eager
smile
to
say
farewell
but
the
old
people
and
little
lydia
were
speechless
with
grief
they
could
not
bear
to
part
with
the
pride
and
hope
and
boyish
strength
that
were
all
their
slender
joy
the
old
man
the
anxious
woman
who
had
been
beaten
and
buffeted
by
the
waves
of
poverty
and
sorrow
the
little
sister
with
her
dreaming
heart
stood
at
the
bars
and
hungrily
watched
him
go
away
they
feared
success
for
him
almost
as
much
as
failure
the
world
was
before
him
now
with
its
treasures
and
pleasures
but
with
those
inevitable
disappointments
and
losses
which
old
people
know
and
fear
those
sorrows
of
incapacity
and
lack
of
judgment
which
young
hearts
go
out
to
meet
without
foreboding
it
was
a
world
of
love
and
favor
to
which
little
lydia
brother
had
gone
but
who
would
know
her
fairy
prince
in
that
disguise
of
a
country
boy
bashfulness
and
humble
raiment
from
the
cheap
counter
of
a
country
store
the
household
stood
rapt
and
silent
until
the
farm
wagon
had
made
its
last
rise
on
the
hilly
road
and
disappeared
well
he
left
us
now
said
the
sorrowful
hopeful
old
grandfather
i
expect
i
got
to
turn
to
an
be
a
boy
again
myself
i
feel
to
hope
do
as
well
as
we
covet
for
him
i
seem
to
take
it
in
all
my
father
felt
when
he
let
me
go
off
to
sea
he
stood
where
standin
now
an
i
was
just
as
triflin
as
pore
and
felt
full
as
big
as
a
man
but
lord
how
i
give
up
when
it
come
night
an
i
took
it
in
i
was
gone
from
home
there
do
ye
father
said
the
pale
mother
gently
she
was
after
all
the
stronger
of
the
two
good
an
you
feel
real
proud
a
year
from
now
when
he
gits
back
i
so
glad
he
got
his
watch
to
carry
he
did
feel
so
grand
i
expect
them
poor
hens
is
sufferin
nobody
thought
on
this
livin
mornin
better
step
an
feed
right
away
sir
she
could
hardly
speak
for
sorrow
and
excitement
but
the
old
man
was
diverted
at
once
and
hobbled
away
with
cheerful
importance
on
his
two
canes
then
she
looked
round
at
the
poor
stony
little
farm
almost
angrily
he
no
natural
turn
for
the
sea
had
but
i
might
have
kept
him
with
me
if
the
land
was
good
for
anything
elisha
felt
as
if
lie
were
in
a
dream
now
that
his
great
adventure
was
begun
he
answered
john
sykes
questions
mechanically
and
his
head
was
a
little
dull
and
dazed
then
he
began
to
fear
that
the
slow
plodding
of
the
farm
horses
would
make
him
too
late
for
the
steamboat
and
with
sudden
satisfaction
pulled
out
the
great
watch
to
see
if
there
were
still
time
enough
to
get
to
the
landing
he
was
filled
with
remorse
because
it
was
impossible
to
remember
whether
he
had
thanked
stover
for
her
gift
it
seemed
like
a
thing
of
life
and
consciousness
as
he
pushed
it
back
into
his
tight
pocket
john
sykes
looked
at
him
curiously
why
that
old
stover
timepiece
ai
it
lend
it
to
ye
did
she
gave
it
to
me
answered
elisha
proudly
you
be
careful
of
that
watch
said
the
driver
soberly
and
elisha
nodded
well
to
ye
be
a
stiddy
lad
advised
john
sykes
a
few
minutes
afterward
do
start
in
too
smart
an
scare
up
to
boston
pride
an
ambition
was
the
downfall
o
old
cole
dog
there
sonny
the
ai
nowheres
in
sight
for
all
your
fidgetin
they
both
smiled
broadly
at
the
humorous
warning
and
as
the
old
wagon
rattled
away
elisha
stood
a
moment
looking
after
it
then
he
went
down
to
the
wharf
by
winding
ways
among
piles
of
decayed
timber
and
disused
a
small
group
of
travelers
and
spectators
had
already
assembled
and
they
stared
at
him
in
a
way
that
made
him
feel
separated
from
his
kind
though
some
of
them
had
come
to
see
him
depart
one
unenlightened
acquaintance
inquired
if
elisha
were
expecting
friends
by
that
morning
boat
and
when
he
explained
that
he
was
going
away
himself
asked
kindly
whether
it
was
to
be
as
far
as
bath
elisha
mentioned
the
word
boston
with
scorn
and
compassion
but
he
did
not
feel
like
discussing
his
brilliant
prospects
now
as
he
had
been
more
than
ready
to
do
the
week
before
just
then
a
deaf
old
woman
asked
for
the
time
of
day
she
sat
next
him
on
the
battered
bench
be
you
going
up
to
bath
dear
she
demanded
suddenly
and
he
said
yes
guess
i
stick
to
you
then
fur
you
go
is
kind
o
blind
in
them
big
places
elisha
faintly
nodded
a
meek
but
grudging
assent
then
after
a
few
moments
he
boldly
rose
tall
umbrella
in
hand
and
joined
the
talkative
company
of
old
and
young
men
at
the
other
side
of
the
wharf
they
proceeded
to
make
very
light
of
a
person
going
to
boston
to
enter
upon
his
business
career
but
after
all
their
thoughts
were
those
of
mingled
respect
and
envy
most
of
them
had
seen
boston
but
no
one
save
elisha
was
going
there
that
day
to
stay
for
a
whole
year
it
made
him
feel
like
a
city
man
the
steamer
whistled
loud
and
hoarse
before
she
came
in
sight
but
presently
the
gay
flags
showed
close
by
above
the
pointed
spruces
then
she
came
jarring
against
the
wharf
and
the
instant
bustle
and
hurry
the
strange
faces
of
the
passengers
and
the
loud
rattle
of
freight
going
on
board
were
as
confusing
and
exciting
as
if
a
small
piece
of
boston
itself
had
been
dropped
into
that
quiet
cove
the
people
on
the
wharf
shouted
cheerful
to
which
the
young
traveler
responded
then
he
seated
himself
well
astern
to
enjoy
the
views
and
felt
as
if
he
had
made
a
thousand
journeys
he
bought
a
newspaper
and
began
to
read
it
with
much
pride
and
a
beating
heart
the
little
old
woman
came
and
sat
beside
him
and
talked
straight
on
whether
he
listened
or
not
until
he
was
afraid
of
what
the
other
passengers
might
think
but
nobody
looked
that
way
and
he
could
not
find
anything
in
the
paper
that
he
cared
to
read
alone
but
unfettered
and
aflame
with
courage
to
himself
he
was
not
the
boy
who
went
away
but
the
proud
man
who
one
day
would
be
coming
home
goin
to
boston
be
ye
asked
the
old
lady
for
the
third
time
and
it
was
still
a
pleasure
to
say
yes
when
the
boat
swung
round
and
there
far
away
on
its
gray
and
green
pasture
slope
with
the
dark
evergreens
standing
back
were
the
low
gray
house
and
the
little
square
barn
and
the
lines
of
fence
that
shut
in
his
home
he
strained
his
eyes
to
see
if
any
one
were
watching
from
the
door
he
had
almost
forgotten
that
they
could
see
him
still
he
sprang
to
the
boat
side
yes
his
mother
remembered
there
was
something
white
waving
from
the
doorway
the
whole
landscape
faded
from
his
eyes
except
that
faraway
gray
house
his
heart
leaped
back
with
love
and
longing
he
gazed
and
gazed
until
a
height
of
green
forest
came
between
and
shut
the
picture
out
then
the
country
boy
went
on
alone
to
make
his
way
in
the
wide
world
in
dark
new
england
days
i
the
last
of
the
neighbors
was
going
home
officious
peter
downs
had
lingered
late
and
sought
for
additional
housework
with
which
to
prolong
her
stay
she
had
talked
incessantly
and
buzzed
like
a
busy
bee
as
she
helped
to
put
away
the
best
crockery
after
the
funeral
supper
while
the
sisters
betsey
and
hannah
knowles
grew
every
moment
more
forbidding
and
unwilling
to
speak
they
lighted
a
solitary
small
oil
lamp
at
last
as
if
for
sunday
evening
idleness
and
put
it
on
the
side
table
in
the
kitchen
we
ai
intending
to
make
a
late
evening
of
it
announced
betsey
the
elder
standing
before
downs
in
an
expectant
final
way
making
an
irresistible
opportunity
for
saying
i
sure
we
more
than
obleeged
to
ye
ai
we
hannah
but
i
do
if
we
ought
to
keep
ye
longer
we
ai
going
to
do
no
more
but
set
down
a
spell
and
kind
of
collect
ourselves
and
then
make
for
bed
susan
downs
offered
one
more
plea
i
stop
all
night
with
ye
welcome
is
gettin
late
an
dark
she
added
plaintively
but
the
sisters
shook
their
heads
quickly
while
hannah
said
that
they
might
as
well
get
used
to
staying
alone
since
they
would
have
to
do
it
first
or
last
in
spite
of
herself
downs
was
obliged
to
put
on
her
funeral
best
bonnet
and
shawl
and
start
on
her
homeward
way
old
maids
she
grumbled
as
the
door
shut
behind
her
all
too
soon
and
denied
her
the
light
of
the
lamp
along
the
footpath
suddenly
there
was
a
bright
ray
from
the
window
as
if
some
one
had
pushed
back
the
curtain
and
stood
with
the
lamp
close
to
the
sash
that
hannah
said
the
retreating
guest
she
told
me
about
things
i
know
if
it
had
been
for
betsey
catch
me
workin
myself
to
pieces
again
for
but
however
grudgingly
this
was
said
downs
conscience
told
her
that
the
industry
of
the
past
two
days
had
been
somewhat
selfish
on
her
part
she
had
hoped
that
in
the
excitement
of
this
unexpected
funeral
season
she
might
for
once
be
taken
into
the
sisters
confidence
more
than
this
she
knew
that
they
were
certain
of
her
motive
and
had
deliberately
refused
the
expected
satisfaction
ai
as
if
i
was
one
o
them
curious
anyway
she
said
to
herself
pityingly
they
might
neighbored
with
somebody
for
once
i
do
believe
everybody
would
have
a
question
ready
for
her
the
next
day
for
it
was
known
that
she
had
been
slaving
herself
devotedly
since
the
news
had
come
of
old
captain
knowles
sudden
death
in
his
bed
from
a
stroke
the
last
of
three
which
had
in
the
course
of
a
year
or
two
changed
him
from
a
strong
old
man
to
a
feeble
cripple
downs
stepped
bravely
along
the
dark
country
road
she
could
see
a
light
in
her
own
kitchen
window
half
a
mile
away
and
did
not
stop
to
notice
either
the
penetrating
dampness
or
the
shadowy
woods
at
her
right
it
was
a
cloudy
night
but
there
was
a
dim
light
over
the
open
fields
she
had
a
disposition
of
mind
towards
the
exciting
circumstances
of
death
and
burial
and
was
in
request
at
such
times
among
her
neighbors
in
this
she
was
like
a
city
person
who
prefers
tragedy
to
comedy
but
not
having
the
semblance
within
her
reach
she
made
the
most
of
looking
on
at
real
griefs
and
departures
some
one
was
walking
towards
her
in
the
road
suddenly
she
heard
footsteps
the
figure
stopped
then
it
came
forward
again
oh
is
you
ai
it
with
a
tone
of
disappointment
i
you
stop
all
night
had
got
to
be
so
late
an
i
was
just
going
over
to
the
knowles
gals
well
to
kind
o
ask
how
they
be
an
peter
downs
was
evidently
counting
on
his
visit
they
never
passed
me
the
compliment
replied
the
wife
i
declare
i
did
covet
the
walk
home
i
most
beat
out
bein
on
foot
so
much
i
was
put
out
with
for
letten
of
me
see
quite
so
plain
that
my
room
was
better
than
my
company
but
i
do
know
i
blame
they
want
to
look
an
see
what
they
got
an
kind
of
git
by
theirselves
i
expect
was
natural
downs
knew
that
her
husband
would
resent
her
first
statements
being
a
sensitive
and
grumbling
man
she
had
formed
a
pacific
habit
of
suiting
her
remarks
to
his
point
of
view
to
save
an
outburst
he
contented
himself
with
calling
the
knowles
girls
hoggish
and
put
a
direct
question
as
to
whether
they
had
let
fall
any
words
about
their
situation
but
martha
downs
was
obliged
to
answer
in
the
negative
was
enoch
holt
there
after
the
folks
come
back
from
the
grave
he
they
never
give
no
encouragement
neither
he
appeared
well
i
must
say
continued
peter
downs
he
took
his
place
next
but
one
behind
us
in
the
procession
of
melinda
dutch
an
walked
to
an
from
with
her
give
her
his
arm
and
then
i
never
see
him
after
we
got
back
but
i
thought
he
might
be
somewhere
in
the
house
an
i
was
out
about
the
barn
an
so
on
they
was
civil
to
him
i
was
by
when
he
come
just
steppin
out
of
the
bedroom
after
we
finished
layin
the
old
into
his
coffin
hannah
looked
real
pleased
when
she
see
enoch
as
if
she
had
really
expected
him
but
betsey
stuck
out
her
hand
if
was
an
eend
board
an
drawed
her
face
solemner
ever
there
they
had
natural
feelin
he
was
their
own
father
when
all
was
said
the
was
an
i
do
know
but
he
was
clever
to
in
his
way
when
he
disappointed
hannah
about
her
marryin
jake
she
to
respect
the
old
foresight
too
sakes
alive
marthy
how
you
do
knock
folks
down
with
one
hand
set
up
with
t
other
chuckled
downs
they
next
discussed
the
captain
appearance
as
he
lay
in
state
in
the
front
room
a
subject
which
with
its
endless
ramifications
would
keep
the
whole
neighborhood
interested
for
weeks
to
come
an
hour
later
the
twinkling
light
in
the
downs
house
suddenly
disappeared
as
martha
downs
took
a
last
look
out
of
doors
through
her
bedroom
window
she
could
see
no
other
light
the
neighbors
had
all
gone
to
bed
it
was
a
little
past
nine
and
the
night
was
damp
and
still
ii
the
captain
knowles
place
was
eastward
from
the
downs
and
a
short
turn
in
the
road
and
the
piece
of
growth
hid
one
house
from
the
other
at
this
unwontedly
late
hour
the
elderly
sisters
were
still
sitting
in
their
warm
kitchen
there
were
bright
coals
under
the
singing
which
hung
from
the
crane
by
three
or
four
long
pothooks
betsey
knowles
objected
when
her
sister
offered
to
put
on
more
wood
father
never
liked
to
leave
no
great
of
a
fire
even
though
he
slept
right
here
in
the
bedroom
he
said
this
floor
was
one
that
would
light
an
catch
easy
you
another
winter
we
can
move
down
and
take
the
bedroom
ourselves
will
be
warmer
for
us
suggested
hannah
but
betsey
shook
her
head
doubtfully
the
thought
of
their
old
father
grave
unwatched
and
undefended
in
the
outermost
dark
field
filled
their
hearts
with
a
strange
tenderness
they
had
been
his
dutiful
patient
slaves
and
it
seemed
like
disloyalty
to
have
abandoned
the
poor
shape
to
be
sitting
there
disregarding
the
thousand
requirements
and
services
of
the
past
more
than
all
they
were
facing
a
free
future
they
were
their
own
mistresses
at
last
though
past
sixty
years
of
age
hannah
was
still
a
child
at
heart
she
chased
away
a
dread
suspicion
when
betsey
forbade
the
wood
lest
this
elder
sister
who
favored
their
father
s
looks
might
take
his
place
as
stern
ruler
of
the
household
betsey
said
the
younger
sister
suddenly
we
have
us
a
cook
stove
wo
we
next
winter
i
expect
we
going
to
have
something
to
do
with
betsey
did
not
answer
it
was
impossible
to
say
whether
she
truly
felt
grief
or
only
assumed
it
she
had
been
sober
and
silent
for
the
most
part
since
she
routed
neighbor
downs
though
she
answered
her
prattling
questions
with
patience
and
sympathy
now
she
rose
from
her
chair
and
went
to
one
of
the
windows
and
pushing
back
the
sash
curtain
pulled
the
wooden
shutter
across
and
hasped
it
i
ai
going
to
bed
just
yet
she
explained
i
been
to
make
sure
nobody
was
coming
in
i
do
know
there
be
any
better
time
to
look
in
the
chest
and
see
what
we
got
to
depend
on
we
never
get
no
chance
to
do
it
by
day
hannah
looked
frightened
for
a
moment
then
nodded
and
turned
to
the
opposite
window
and
pulled
that
shutter
with
much
difficulty
it
had
always
caught
and
hitched
and
been
provoking
a
warped
piece
of
red
oak
when
white
pine
would
have
saved
strength
and
patience
to
three
generations
of
the
knowles
race
then
the
sisters
crossed
the
kitchen
and
opened
the
bedroom
door
hannah
shivered
a
little
as
the
colder
air
struck
her
and
her
heart
beat
loudly
perhaps
it
was
the
same
with
betsey
the
bedroom
was
clean
and
orderly
for
the
funeral
guests
instead
of
the
blue
homespun
there
was
a
beautifully
quilted
white
coverlet
which
had
been
part
of
their
mother
wedding
furnishing
and
this
made
the
bedstead
with
its
four
low
unfamiliar
and
awesome
the
lamplight
shone
through
the
kitchen
door
behind
them
not
very
bright
at
best
but
betsey
reached
under
the
bed
and
with
all
the
strength
she
could
muster
pulled
out
the
end
of
a
great
sea
chest
the
sisters
tugged
together
and
pushed
and
made
the
most
of
their
strength
before
they
finally
brought
it
through
the
narrow
door
into
the
kitchen
the
solemnity
of
the
deed
made
them
both
whisper
as
they
talked
and
hannah
did
not
dare
to
say
what
was
in
her
timid
heart
that
she
would
rather
brave
discovery
by
daylight
than
such
a
feeling
of
being
disapprovingly
watched
now
in
the
dead
of
night
there
came
a
slight
sound
outside
the
house
which
made
her
look
anxiously
at
betsey
but
betsey
remained
tranquil
it
nothing
but
a
stick
falling
down
the
woodpile
she
answered
in
a
contemptuous
whisper
and
the
younger
woman
was
reassured
betsey
reached
deep
into
her
pocket
and
found
a
great
key
which
was
worn
smooth
and
bright
like
silver
and
never
had
been
trusted
willingly
into
even
her
own
careful
hands
hannah
held
the
lamp
and
the
two
thin
figures
bent
eagerly
over
the
lid
as
it
opened
their
shadows
were
waving
about
the
low
walls
and
looked
like
strange
shapes
bowing
and
dancing
behind
them
the
chest
was
stoutly
timbered
as
if
it
were
built
in
some
and
there
were
heavy
hinges
and
a
large
escutcheon
for
the
keyhole
that
the
ship
blacksmith
might
have
hammered
out
on
the
top
somebody
had
scratched
deeply
the
crossed
lines
for
a
game
of
fox
and
geese
which
had
a
trivial
irreverent
look
and
might
have
been
the
unforgiven
fault
of
some
idle
ship
boy
the
sisters
had
hardly
dared
look
at
the
chest
or
to
signify
their
knowledge
of
its
existence
at
unwary
times
they
had
swept
carefully
about
it
year
after
year
and
wondered
if
it
were
indeed
full
of
gold
as
the
neighbors
used
to
hint
but
no
matter
how
much
found
a
way
in
little
had
found
the
way
out
they
had
been
hampered
all
their
lives
for
money
and
in
consequence
had
developed
a
wonderful
facility
for
spinning
and
weaving
mending
and
making
their
small
farm
was
an
early
example
of
intensive
farming
they
were
allowed
to
use
its
products
in
a
niggardly
way
but
the
money
that
was
paid
for
wool
for
hay
for
wood
and
for
summer
crops
had
all
gone
into
the
chest
the
old
captain
was
a
hard
master
he
rarely
commended
and
often
blamed
hannah
trembled
before
him
but
betsey
faced
him
sturdily
being
amazingly
like
him
with
a
feminine
difference
as
like
as
a
ruled
person
can
be
to
a
ruler
for
the
discipline
of
life
had
taught
the
man
to
aggress
the
woman
only
to
defend
in
the
chest
was
a
fabled
sum
of
besides
these
slender
earnings
of
many
years
all
the
sisters
hard
work
and
were
there
in
money
and
a
mysterious
largess
besides
all
their
lives
they
had
been
looking
forward
to
this
hour
of
ownership
there
was
a
solemn
hush
in
the
house
the
two
sisters
were
safe
from
their
neighbors
and
there
was
no
fear
of
interruption
at
such
an
hour
in
that
community
tired
with
a
day
work
that
had
been
early
begun
if
any
one
came
knocking
at
the
door
both
door
and
windows
were
securely
fastened
the
eager
sisters
bent
above
the
chest
they
held
their
breath
and
talked
in
softest
whispers
with
stealthy
tread
a
man
came
out
of
the
woods
near
by
he
stopped
to
listen
came
nearer
stopped
again
and
then
crept
close
to
the
old
house
he
stepped
upon
the
banking
next
the
window
with
the
warped
shutter
there
was
a
knothole
in
it
high
above
the
heads
towards
the
top
as
they
leaned
over
the
chest
an
eager
eye
watched
them
if
they
had
turned
that
way
suspiciously
the
eye
might
have
caught
the
flicker
of
the
lamp
and
betrayed
itself
no
they
were
too
busy
the
eye
at
the
shutter
watched
and
watched
there
was
a
certain
feeling
of
relief
in
the
sisters
minds
because
the
contents
of
the
chest
were
so
commonplace
at
first
sight
there
were
some
old
belongings
dating
back
to
their
father
early
days
of
seafaring
they
unfolded
a
waistcoat
pattern
or
two
of
figured
stuff
which
they
had
seen
him
fold
and
put
away
again
and
again
once
he
had
given
betsey
a
gay
china
silk
handkerchief
and
here
were
two
more
like
it
they
had
not
known
what
a
store
of
treasures
might
be
waiting
for
them
but
the
reality
so
far
was
disappointing
there
was
much
spare
room
to
begin
with
and
the
wares
within
looked
pinched
and
few
there
were
bundles
of
papers
old
receipts
some
letters
in
two
not
very
thick
bundles
some
old
account
books
with
worn
edges
and
a
blackened
silver
can
which
looked
very
small
in
comparison
with
their
anticipation
being
an
heirloom
and
jealously
hoarded
and
secreted
by
the
old
man
the
women
began
to
feel
as
if
his
lean
angry
figure
were
bending
with
them
over
the
sea
chest
they
opened
a
package
wrapped
in
many
layers
of
old
soft
paper
a
worked
piece
of
indian
muslin
and
an
embroidered
red
scarf
which
they
had
never
seen
before
he
must
have
brought
them
home
to
mother
said
betsey
with
a
great
outburst
of
feeling
he
never
was
the
same
man
again
he
never
would
let
nobody
else
have
them
when
he
found
she
was
dead
poor
old
father
hannah
looked
wistfully
at
the
treasures
she
rebuked
herself
for
selfishness
but
she
thought
of
her
pinched
girlhood
and
the
delight
these
things
would
have
been
ah
yes
it
was
too
late
now
for
many
things
besides
the
sprigged
muslin
if
i
was
young
as
i
was
once
there
lots
o
things
i
like
to
do
now
i
free
said
hannah
with
a
gentle
sigh
but
her
sister
checked
her
anxiously
it
was
fitting
that
they
should
preserve
a
semblance
of
mourning
even
to
themselves
the
lamp
stood
in
a
kitchen
chair
at
the
chest
end
and
shone
full
across
their
faces
betsey
looked
intent
and
sober
as
she
turned
over
the
old
man
treasures
under
the
india
mull
was
an
antique
pair
of
buff
trousers
a
waistcoat
of
strange
foreign
stuff
and
a
blue
coat
with
brass
buttons
brought
home
from
over
seas
as
the
women
knew
for
their
father
wedding
clothes
they
had
seen
him
carry
them
out
at
long
intervals
to
hang
them
in
the
spring
sunshine
he
had
been
very
feeble
the
last
time
and
hannah
remembered
that
she
had
longed
to
take
them
from
his
shaking
hands
i
declare
for
i
wish
we
had
laid
him
out
in
o
the
robe
she
whispered
but
betsey
made
no
answer
she
was
kneeling
still
but
held
herself
upright
and
looked
away
it
was
evident
that
she
was
lost
in
her
own
thoughts
i
ca
find
nothing
else
by
eyesight
she
muttered
this
chest
never
be
so
heavy
with
them
old
clothes
stop
hold
that
light
down
hannah
there
a
place
underneath
here
them
papers
in
the
till
takes
a
shallow
part
oh
my
gracious
see
here
will
ye
hold
the
light
hold
the
light
there
was
a
hidden
drawer
in
the
chest
side
a
long
deep
place
and
it
was
full
of
gold
pieces
hannah
had
seated
herself
in
the
chair
to
be
out
of
her
sister
way
she
held
the
lamp
with
one
hand
and
gathered
her
apron
on
her
lap
with
the
other
while
betsey
exultant
and
took
out
handful
after
handful
of
heavy
coins
letting
them
jingle
and
chink
letting
them
shine
in
the
lamp
rays
letting
them
roll
across
the
floor
guineas
dollars
doubloons
old
french
and
spanish
and
english
gold
now
look
the
eye
at
the
window
at
last
they
have
found
it
all
the
bag
of
silver
the
great
roll
of
bank
bills
and
the
heavy
weight
of
gold
the
that
had
been
like
robinson
crusoe
in
the
cave
they
were
rich
women
that
night
their
faces
grew
young
again
as
they
sat
side
by
side
and
exulted
while
the
old
kitchen
grew
cold
there
was
nothing
they
might
not
do
within
the
range
of
their
timid
ambitions
they
were
women
of
fortune
now
and
their
own
mistresses
they
were
beginning
at
last
to
live
the
watcher
outside
was
cramped
and
chilled
he
let
himself
down
softly
from
the
high
step
of
the
winter
banking
and
crept
toward
the
barn
where
he
might
bury
himself
in
the
hay
and
think
his
fingers
were
quick
to
find
the
peg
that
opened
the
little
barn
door
the
beasts
within
were
startled
and
stumbled
to
their
feet
then
went
back
to
their
slumbers
the
night
wore
on
the
light
spring
rain
began
to
fall
and
the
sound
of
it
on
the
house
roof
close
down
upon
the
sisters
bed
lulled
them
quickly
to
sleep
twelve
one
two
passed
by
they
had
put
back
the
money
and
the
clothes
and
the
minor
goods
and
treasures
and
pulled
the
chest
back
into
the
bedroom
so
that
it
was
out
of
sight
from
the
kitchen
the
bedroom
door
was
always
shut
by
day
the
younger
sister
wished
to
carry
the
money
to
their
own
room
but
betsey
disdained
such
precaution
the
money
had
always
been
safe
in
the
old
chest
and
there
it
should
stay
the
next
week
they
would
go
to
riverport
and
put
it
into
the
bank
it
was
no
use
to
lose
the
interest
any
longer
because
their
father
had
lost
some
invested
money
in
his
early
youth
it
did
not
follow
that
every
bank
was
faithless
betsey
was
amazing
but
they
still
whispered
to
each
other
as
they
got
ready
for
bed
with
strange
forgetfulness
betsey
had
laid
the
chest
key
on
the
white
coverlet
in
the
bedroom
and
left
it
there
iii
in
august
of
that
year
the
whole
countryside
turned
out
to
go
to
court
the
sisters
had
been
rich
for
one
night
in
the
morning
they
waked
to
find
themselves
poor
with
a
bitter
pang
of
poverty
of
which
they
had
never
dreamed
they
had
said
little
but
they
grew
suddenly
pinched
and
old
they
could
not
tell
how
much
money
they
had
lost
except
that
hannah
lap
was
full
of
gold
a
weight
she
could
not
lift
nor
carry
after
a
few
days
of
stolid
misery
they
had
gone
to
the
chief
lawyer
of
their
neighborhood
to
accuse
enoch
holt
of
the
robbery
they
dressed
in
their
best
and
walked
solemnly
side
by
side
across
the
fields
and
along
the
road
the
shortest
way
to
the
man
of
law
enoch
daughter
saw
them
go
as
she
stood
in
her
doorway
and
felt
a
cold
shiver
run
through
her
frame
as
if
in
foreboding
her
father
was
not
at
home
he
had
left
for
boston
late
on
the
afternoon
of
captain
knowles
funeral
he
had
had
notice
the
day
before
of
the
coming
in
of
a
ship
in
which
he
owned
a
there
was
talk
of
selling
the
ship
and
the
owners
agent
had
summoned
him
he
had
taken
pains
to
go
to
the
funeral
because
he
and
the
old
captain
had
been
on
bad
terms
ever
since
they
had
bought
a
piece
of
woodland
together
and
the
captain
declared
himself
wronged
at
the
settling
of
accounts
he
was
growing
feeble
even
then
and
had
left
the
business
to
the
younger
man
enoch
holt
was
not
a
trusted
man
yet
he
had
never
before
been
openly
accused
of
dishonesty
he
was
not
a
professor
of
religion
but
foremost
on
the
secular
side
of
church
matters
most
of
the
men
in
that
region
were
hard
men
it
was
difficult
to
get
money
and
there
was
little
real
comfort
in
a
community
where
the
sterner
stingier
forbidding
side
of
new
england
life
was
well
exemplified
the
proper
steps
had
been
taken
by
the
officers
of
the
law
and
in
answer
to
the
writ
enoch
holt
appeared
much
shocked
and
very
indignant
and
was
released
on
bail
which
covered
the
sum
his
shipping
interest
had
brought
him
the
weeks
had
dragged
by
june
and
july
were
long
in
passing
and
here
was
court
day
at
last
and
all
the
townsfolk
hastening
by
and
to
the
the
knowles
girls
themselves
had
risen
at
break
of
day
and
walked
the
distance
steadfastly
like
two
of
the
three
fates
who
would
make
the
third
to
cut
the
thread
for
their
enemy
disaster
public
opinion
was
divided
there
were
many
voices
ready
to
speak
on
the
accused
man
side
a
acquaintance
left
his
business
in
boston
to
swear
that
holt
was
in
his
office
before
noon
on
the
day
following
the
robbery
and
that
he
had
spent
most
of
the
night
in
boston
as
proved
by
several
minor
details
of
their
interview
as
for
holt
young
married
daughter
she
was
a
favorite
with
the
townsfolk
and
her
husband
was
away
at
sea
overdue
these
last
few
weeks
she
sat
on
one
of
the
hard
court
benches
with
a
young
child
in
her
arms
born
since
its
father
sailed
they
had
been
more
or
less
unlucky
the
holt
family
though
enoch
himself
was
a
man
of
brag
and
bluster
all
the
hot
august
morning
until
the
noon
recess
and
all
the
hot
august
afternoon
and
wretched
with
the
heavy
air
the
crowd
of
neighbors
listened
to
the
trial
there
was
not
much
evidence
brought
everybody
knew
that
enoch
holt
left
the
funeral
procession
hurriedly
and
went
away
on
horseback
towards
boston
his
daughter
knew
no
more
than
this
the
boston
man
gave
his
testimony
impatiently
and
one
or
two
persons
insisted
that
they
saw
the
accused
on
his
way
at
nightfall
several
miles
from
home
as
the
testimony
came
out
it
all
tended
to
prove
his
innocence
though
public
opinion
was
to
the
contrary
the
knowles
sisters
looked
more
stern
and
gray
hour
by
hour
their
vengeance
was
not
to
be
satisfied
their
accusation
had
been
listened
to
and
found
wanting
but
their
instinctive
knowledge
of
the
matter
counted
for
nothing
they
must
have
been
watched
through
the
of
the
shutter
nobody
had
noticed
it
until
some
years
before
enoch
holt
himself
had
spoken
of
the
light
shining
through
on
a
winter
night
as
he
came
towards
the
house
the
chief
proof
was
that
nobody
else
could
have
done
the
deed
but
why
linger
over
and
the
jury
returned
directly
with
a
verdict
of
not
proven
and
the
tired
audience
left
the
but
not
until
hannah
knowles
with
angry
eyes
had
risen
to
her
feet
the
sterner
elder
sister
tried
to
pull
her
back
every
one
said
that
they
should
have
looked
to
betsey
to
say
the
awful
words
that
followed
not
to
her
gentler
companion
it
was
hannah
broken
and
disappointed
who
cried
in
a
strange
high
voice
as
enoch
holt
was
passing
by
without
a
look
you
stole
it
you
thief
you
know
it
in
your
heart
the
startled
man
faltered
then
he
faced
the
women
the
people
who
stood
near
seemed
made
of
eyes
as
they
stared
to
see
what
he
would
say
i
swear
by
my
right
hand
i
never
touched
it
curse
your
right
hand
then
cried
hannah
knowles
growing
tall
and
thin
like
a
white
flame
drawing
upward
curse
your
right
hand
yours
and
all
your
folks
that
follow
you
may
i
live
to
see
the
day
the
people
drew
back
while
for
a
moment
accused
and
accuser
stood
face
to
face
then
holt
flushed
face
turned
white
and
he
shrank
from
the
fire
in
those
wild
eyes
and
walked
away
clumsily
down
the
courtroom
nobody
followed
him
nobody
shook
hands
with
him
or
told
the
acquitted
man
that
they
were
glad
of
his
release
half
an
hour
later
betsey
and
hannah
knowles
took
their
homeward
way
to
begin
their
hard
round
of
work
again
the
horizon
that
had
widened
with
such
glory
for
one
night
had
closed
round
them
again
like
an
iron
wall
betsey
was
alarmed
and
excited
by
her
sister
uncharacteristic
behavior
and
she
looked
at
her
anxiously
from
time
to
time
hannah
had
become
the
of
the
two
her
disappointment
was
the
keener
for
she
had
kept
more
of
the
unsatisfied
desires
of
her
girlhood
until
that
dreary
morning
when
they
found
the
rifled
and
the
treasure
gone
betsey
said
inconsequently
that
it
was
a
pity
she
did
not
have
that
black
silk
gown
that
would
stand
alone
they
had
planned
for
it
over
the
open
chest
and
hannah
was
to
be
a
handsome
green
they
might
have
worn
them
to
court
but
even
the
pathetic
facetiousness
of
her
elder
sister
did
not
bring
a
smile
to
hannah
knowles
face
and
the
next
day
one
was
at
the
loom
and
the
other
at
the
wheel
again
the
neighbors
talked
about
the
curse
with
horror
in
their
minds
a
fabric
of
sad
fate
was
spun
from
the
bitter
words
the
knowles
sisters
never
had
worn
silk
gowns
and
they
never
would
sometimes
hannah
or
betsey
would
stealthily
look
over
the
chest
in
one
or
the
other
absence
one
day
when
betsey
was
very
old
and
her
mind
had
grown
feeble
she
tied
her
own
india
silk
handkerchief
about
her
neck
but
they
never
used
the
other
two
they
aired
the
wedding
suit
once
every
spring
as
long
as
they
lived
they
were
both
too
old
and
forlorn
to
make
up
the
india
mull
nobody
knows
how
many
times
they
took
everything
out
of
the
heavy
old
clamped
box
and
peered
into
every
nook
and
corner
to
see
if
there
was
not
a
single
gold
piece
left
they
never
answered
any
one
who
made
bold
to
speak
of
their
misfortune
iv
enoch
holt
had
been
a
seafaring
man
in
his
early
days
and
there
was
news
that
the
owners
of
a
salem
ship
in
which
he
held
a
small
interest
wished
him
to
go
out
as
supercargo
he
was
brisk
and
well
in
health
and
his
an
honest
but
an
unlucky
fellow
had
done
less
well
than
usual
so
that
nobody
was
surprised
when
enoch
made
ready
for
his
voyage
it
was
nearly
a
year
after
the
theft
and
nothing
had
come
so
near
to
restoring
him
to
public
favor
as
his
apparent
lack
of
ready
money
he
openly
said
that
he
put
great
hope
in
his
adventure
to
the
spice
islands
and
when
he
said
farewell
one
sunday
to
some
members
of
the
dispersing
congregation
more
than
one
person
wished
him
heartily
a
pleasant
voyage
and
safe
return
he
had
an
insinuating
tone
of
voice
and
an
imploring
look
that
day
and
this
fact
with
his
probable
long
absence
and
the
dangers
of
the
deep
won
him
much
sympathy
it
is
a
shameful
thing
to
accuse
a
man
wrongfully
and
enoch
holt
had
behaved
well
since
the
trial
and
what
is
more
had
shown
no
accession
to
his
means
of
living
so
away
he
went
with
a
fair
amount
of
good
wishes
though
one
or
two
persons
assured
remonstrating
listeners
that
they
thought
it
likely
enoch
would
make
a
good
voyage
better
than
common
and
show
himself
forwarded
when
he
came
to
port
soon
after
his
departure
peter
downs
and
an
intimate
acquaintance
discussed
the
subject
of
the
knowles
robbery
over
a
friendly
cup
of
tea
they
were
in
the
downs
kitchen
and
quite
by
themselves
peter
downs
himself
had
been
drawn
as
a
juror
and
had
been
for
two
days
at
the
county
town
downs
was
giving
herself
to
social
interests
in
his
absence
and
forder
an
asthmatic
but
very
companionable
person
had
arrived
by
two
that
afternoon
with
her
knitting
work
sure
of
being
welcome
the
two
old
friends
had
first
talked
over
varied
subjects
of
immediate
concern
but
when
supper
was
nearly
finished
they
fell
back
upon
the
lost
knowles
gold
as
has
been
already
said
they
got
a
dreadful
blow
poor
gals
wheezed
forder
with
compassion
was
harder
for
them
than
for
most
folks
they
had
a
long
stent
with
the
ol
gentleman
very
arbitrary
very
arbitrary
yes
answered
downs
pushing
back
her
then
lifting
it
again
to
see
if
it
was
quite
empty
yes
it
took
holt
o
hannah
the
most
i
should
said
betsey
was
a
good
deal
the
most
set
in
her
ways

been
most
tore
up
but
so
lucky
that
holt

pretty
quick
i

plaintive
sigh
and
began
to
knit
again
downs

creepy
now
downs
confessed
uneasily
they
do
look
pleadin
an
childish
same
they

seems
to
me
as
if
she
had
the
worst
o
we
ai
seen
the
end
o
yit
said
forder
impressively
i
feel
it
within
me
marthy
downs
an
it
a
terrible
thing
to
have
happened
right
us
in
christian
times
if
we
live
long
enough
we
goin
to
have
plenty
to
talk
over
in
our
old
age
that
come
that
cuss
some
seed
shy
o
sproutin
till
a
spring
when
the
jest
right
to
breed
it
there
lobeely
now
agreed
downs
pleased
to
descend
to
prosaic
and
familiar
levels
they
ai
a
good
crop
one
year
in
six
and
then
you
find
it
in
a
place
where
you
never
observed
none
to
grow
afore
like
not
ai
it
so
reelly
and
she
rose
to
clear
the
table
pleased
with
the
certainty
of
a
guest
that
night
their
conversation
was
not
reassuring
to
the
heart
of
a
timid
woman
alone
in
an
isolated
farmhouse
on
a
dark
spring
evening
especially
so
near
the
anniversary
of
old
captain
knowles
death
later
in
these
rural
lives
by
many
years
two
aged
women
were
crossing
a
wide
field
together
following
a
footpath
such
as
one
often
finds
between
widely
separated
homes
of
the
new
england
country
along
these
lightly
traced
thoroughfares
the
children
go
to
play
and
lovers
to
plead
and
older
people
to
companion
one
another
in
work
and
pleasure
in
sickness
and
sorrow
generation
after
generation
comes
and
goes
again
by
these
country
the
footpath
led
from
forder
to
another
farmhouse
half
a
mile
beyond
where
there
had
been
a
wedding
downs
was
there
and
in
the
june
weather
she
had
been
easily
persuaded
to
go
home
to
tea
with
forder
with
the
promise
of
being
driven
home
later
in
the
evening
downs
husband
had
been
dead
three
years
and
her
friend
large
family
was
scattered
from
the
old
nest
they
were
lonely
at
times
in
their
later
years
these
old
friends
and
found
it
very
pleasant
now
to
have
a
walk
together
thin
little
forder
with
all
her
wheezing
was
the
stronger
and
more
active
of
the
two
downs
had
grown
heavier
and
weaker
with
advancing
years
they
paced
along
the
footpath
slowly
downs
rolling
in
her
gait
like
a
sailor
and
availing
herself
of
every
pretext
to
stop
and
look
at
herbs
in
the
pasture
ground
they
crossed
and
at
the
growing
grass
in
the
mowing
fields
they
discussed
the
wedding
minutely
and
then
where
the
way
grew
wider
they
walked
side
by
side
instead
of
following
each
other
and
their
voices
sank
to
the
low
tone
that
betokens
confidence
you
do
say
that
you
really
put
faith
in
all
them
old
stories
it
ai
accident
altogether
noways
you
can
fix
it
in
your
mind
maintained
downs
need
tell
me
that
cussin
do
do
neither
good
nor
harm
i
should
want
to
marry
the
holts
if
i
was
young
i
when
this
young
man
was
born
that
married

accident
his
mother

her
there

o
lurch
when

next
time

stood
up
in
the
house
o
god

left
hand

hand
to
turn
his
leaf
with

forder
very
with
climbing
the
long
slope
of
the
pasture
hill

i
as
soon
be
them
as
the
knowles
gals

after
she
spoke
them
words
in
the
they
come
back
an
harnted
her
an
you
know
miss
downs
better
i
do
being
as
one
may
say
how
they
lived
their
lives
out
like
wild
beasts
into
a
lair
they
used
to
go
out
some
by
night
to
git
the
air
pursued
downs
with
interest
i
used
to
open
the
door
an
step
right
in
an
i
used
to
take
their
yarn
an
stuff
o
mine
an
sell
an
do
for
the
poor
stray
creatur
long
they
let
me
they
be
grateful
for
a
mess
o
early
pease
or
potatoes
as
ever
you
see
an
peter
he
allays
favored
with
pork
fresh
an
salt
when
we
slaughtered
the
old
kept
long
as
he
lived
an
then
they
was
too
old
to
different
i
allays
liked
hannah
the
best
till
that
change
struck
her
betsey
she
held
out
to
the
last
jest
about
the
same
i
do
know
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
but
what
she
felt
it
the
most
o
the
two
they
never
let
me
much
as
git
a
look
at
complained
forder
folks
got
awful
stories
one
time
i
heard
it
said
an
it
allays
creeped
me
cold
all
over
that
there
was
come
an
lived
with
a
kind
o
black
shadder
a
cobweb
kind
o
a
that
followed
about
the
house
an
made
a
third
to
them
but
they
got
hardened
to
it
theirselves
only
they
was
afraid
would
follow
if
they
went
anywheres
from
home
you
do
believe
no
such
piece
o
nonsense
but
there
i
asked
ye
times
enough
before
they
got
shadders
enough
poor
creatur
said
downs
with
reserve
was
no
kind
o
need
to
make
up
no
spooks
as
i
know
on
well
here
these
young
folks
i
wish
well
sure
she
likes
him
with
his
one
hand
better
than
most
gals
likes
them
as
has
a
good
sound
pair
they
looked
prime
happy
i
hope
no
curse
wo
foller
the
friends
stopped
again
poor
bodies
on
the
crest
of
the
low
hill
and
turned
to
look
at
the
wide
landscape
bewildered
by
the
marvelous
beauty
and
the
sudden
flood
of
golden
sunset
light
that
poured
out
of
the
western
sky
they
could
not
remember
that
they
had
ever
observed
the
wide
view
before
it
was
like
a
revelation
or
an
outlook
towards
the
celestial
country
the
sight
of
their
own
green
farms
and
the
countryside
that
bounded
them
it
was
a
pleasant
country
indeed
their
own
new
england
their
petty
thoughts
and
vain
imaginings
seemed
futile
and
unrelated
to
so
fair
a
scene
of
things
but
the
figure
of
a
man
who
was
crossing
the
meadow
below
looked
like
a
malicious
black
insect
it
was
an
old
man
it
was
enoch
holt
time
had
worn
and
bent
him
enough
to
have
satisfied
his
bitterest
foe
the
women
could
see
his
empty
flutter
as
he
walked
slowly
and
unexpectantly
in
that
glorious
evening
light
the
white
rose
road
being
a
new
englander
it
is
natural
that
i
should
first
speak
about
the
weather
only
the
middle
of
june
the
green
fields
and
blue
sky
and
bright
sun
with
a
touch
of
northern
mountain
wind
blowing
straight
toward
the
sea
could
make
such
a
day
and
that
is
all
one
can
say
about
it
we
were
driving
seaward
through
a
part
of
the
country
which
has
been
least
changed
in
the
last
thirty
years
among
farms
which
have
been
won
from
swampy
lowland
and
rocky
hillsides
where
the
forests
wall
in
the
fields
and
send
their
outposts
year
by
year
farther
into
the
pastures
there
is
a
year
or
two
in
the
history
of
these
pastures
before
they
have
arrived
at
the
dignity
of
being
called
woodland
and
yet
are
too
much
shaded
and
overgrown
by
young
trees
to
give
proper
pasturage
when
they
made
delightful
harbors
for
the
small
wild
creatures
which
yet
remain
and
for
wild
flowers
and
berries
here
you
send
an
astonished
rabbit
scurrying
to
his
burrow
and
there
you
startle
yourself
with
a
partridge
who
seems
to
get
the
best
of
the
encounter
sometimes
you
see
a
hen
partridge
and
her
brood
of
chickens
crossing
your
path
with
an
air
of
comfortable
security
as
you
drive
along
the
narrow
grassy
road
you
see
many
charming
sights
and
delightful
nooks
on
either
hand
where
the
young
trees
spring
out
of
a
turf
that
carpets
the
ground
like
velvet
toward
the
east
and
the
quaint
fishing
village
of
ogunquit
i
find
the
most
delightful
woodland
roads
there
is
little
left
of
the
large
timber
which
once
filled
the
region
but
much
young
growth
and
there
are
hundreds
of
acres
of
cleared
land
and
where
the
forests
are
springing
fast
and
covering
the
country
once
more
as
if
they
had
no
idea
of
losing
in
their
war
with
civilization
and
the
intruding
white
settler
the
pine
woods
and
the
indians
seem
to
be
next
of
kin
and
the
former
owners
of
this
corner
of
new
england
are
the
only
proper
figures
to
paint
into
such
landscapes
the
twilight
under
tall
pines
seems
to
be
untenanted
and
to
lack
something
at
first
sight
as
if
one
opened
the
door
of
an
empty
house
a
farmer
passing
through
with
his
axe
is
but
an
intruder
and
children
straying
home
from
school
give
one
a
feeling
of
solicitude
at
their
unprotectedness
the
pine
woods
are
the
red
man
house
and
it
may
be
hazardous
even
yet
for
the
gray
farmhouses
to
stand
so
near
the
eaves
of
the
forest
i
have
noticed
a
distrust
of
the
deep
woods
among
elderly
people
which
was
something
more
than
a
fear
of
losing
their
way
it
was
a
feeling
of
defenselessness
against
some
unrecognized
but
malicious
influence
driving
through
the
long
woodland
way
shaded
and
chilly
when
you
are
out
of
the
sun
across
the
great
works
river
and
its
pretty
intervale
across
the
short
bridges
of
brown
brooks
delayed
now
and
then
by
the
sight
of
ripe
strawberries
in
sunny
spots
by
the
roadside
one
comes
to
a
higher
open
country
where
farm
joins
farm
and
the
cleared
fields
lie
all
along
the
highway
while
the
woods
are
pushed
back
a
good
distance
on
either
hand
the
wooded
hills
bleak
here
and
there
with
granite
ledges
rise
beyond
the
houses
are
beside
the
road
with
green
and
large
barns
almost
empty
now
and
with
wide
doors
standing
open
as
if
they
were
already
expecting
the
hay
crop
to
be
brought
in
the
tall
green
grass
is
waving
in
the
fields
as
the
wind
goes
over
and
there
is
a
fragrance
of
whiteweed
and
ripe
strawberries
and
clover
blowing
through
the
sunshiny
barns
with
their
lean
sides
and
their
festoons
of
brown
dusty
cobwebs
dull
comfortable
creatures
they
appear
to
imaginative
eyes
waiting
hungrily
for
their
yearly
meal
the
are
teasing
their
sleepy
shapes
like
the
birds
which
flit
about
great
beasts
gay
movable
irreverent
almost
derisive
those
barn
swallows
fly
to
and
fro
in
the
still
clear
air
the
noise
of
our
wheels
brings
fewer
faces
to
the
windows
than
usual
and
we
lose
the
pleasure
of
seeing
some
of
our
friends
who
are
apt
to
be
looking
out
and
to
whom
we
like
to
say
some
funeral
must
be
taking
place
or
perhaps
the
women
may
have
gone
out
into
the
fields
it
is
and
and
already
we
have
seen
some
of
the
younger
women
at
work
among
the
corn
and
potatoes
one
sight
will
be
charming
to
remember
on
a
green
hillside
sloping
to
the
west
near
one
of
the
houses
a
thin
little
girl
was
working
away
lustily
with
a
big
hoe
on
a
patch
of
land
perhaps
fifty
feet
by
twenty
there
were
all
sorts
of
things
growing
there
as
if
a
fancy
had
made
the
choice
straight
rows
of
turnips
and
carrots
and
beets
a
little
of
everything
one
might
say
but
the
only
touch
of
color
was
from
a
long
border
of
useful
sage
in
full
bloom
of
dull
blue
on
the
upper
side
i
am
sure
this
was
called
katy
or
by
the
elder
members
of
the
family
one
can
imagine
how
the
young
creature
had
planned
it
in
the
spring
and
persuaded
the
men
to
plough
and
harrow
it
and
since
then
had
stoutly
done
all
the
work
herself
and
meant
to
send
the
harvest
of
the
piece
to
market
and
pocket
her
honest
gains
as
they
came
in
for
some
great
end
she
was
as
thin
as
a
grasshopper
this
busy
little
gardener
and
hardly
turned
to
give
us
a
glance
as
we
drove
slowly
up
the
hill
close
by
the
sun
will
brown
and
dry
her
like
a
spear
of
grass
on
that
hot
slope
but
a
spark
of
fine
spirit
is
in
the
small
body
and
i
wish
her
a
famous
crop
i
hate
to
say
that
the
piece
looked
backward
all
except
the
sage
and
that
it
was
a
heavy
bit
of
land
for
the
clumsy
hoe
to
pick
at
the
only
puzzle
is
what
she
proposes
to
do
with
so
long
a
row
of
sage
yet
there
may
be
a
large
family
with
a
downfall
of
measles
yet
ahead
and
she
does
not
mean
to
be
caught
without
along
this
road
every
one
of
the
old
farmhouses
has
at
least
one
tall
bush
of
white
roses
by
the
door
a
most
lovely
sight
with
buds
and
blossoms
and
unvexed
green
leaves
i
wish
that
i
knew
the
history
of
them
and
whence
the
first
bush
was
brought
perhaps
from
england
itself
like
a
red
rose
that
i
know
in
kittery
and
the
new
shoots
from
the
root
were
given
to
one
neighbor
after
another
all
through
the
district
the
bushes
are
slender
but
they
grow
tall
without
climbing
against
the
wall
and
sway
to
and
fro
in
the
wind
with
a
grace
of
youth
and
an
inexpressible
charm
of
beauty
how
many
lovers
must
have
picked
them
on
sunday
evenings
in
all
the
bygone
years
and
carried
them
along
the
roads
or
by
the
pasture
footpaths
hiding
them
clumsily
under
their
sunday
coats
if
they
caught
sight
of
any
one
coming
here
too
where
the
sea
wind
nips
many
a
young
life
before
its
prime
how
often
the
white
roses
have
been
put
into
paler
hands
and
withered
there
in
spite
of
the
serene
and
placid
look
of
the
old
houses
one
who
has
always
known
them
can
not
help
thinking
of
the
sorrows
of
these
farms
and
their
almost
undiverted
toil
near
the
little
plot
we
turned
from
the
main
road
and
drove
through
lately
cleared
woodland
up
to
an
old
farmhouse
high
on
a
ledgy
hill
whence
there
is
a
fine
view
of
the
country
seaward
and
there
were
few
of
the
once
large
household
left
there
only
the
old
farmer
who
was
crippled
by
war
wounds
active
cheerful
man
that
he
was
once
and
two
young
orphan
children
there
has
been
much
hard
work
spent
on
the
place
every
generation
has
toiled
from
youth
to
age
without
being
able
to
make
much
beyond
a
living
the
dollars
that
can
be
saved
are
but
few
and
sickness
and
death
have
often
brought
their
bitter
cost
the
mistress
of
the
farm
was
helpless
for
many
years
through
all
the
summers
and
winters
she
sat
in
her
pillowed
in
the
plain
room
she
could
watch
the
lane
and
beyond
it
a
little
way
across
the
fields
were
the
woods
besides
these
only
the
clouds
in
the
sky
she
could
not
lift
her
food
to
her
mouth
she
could
not
be
her
husband
working
partner
she
never
went
into
another
house
to
see
her
works
and
ways
but
sat
there
aching
and
tired
vexed
by
flies
and
by
heat
and
isolated
in
long
storms
yet
the
whole
countryside
neighbored
her
with
true
affection
her
spirit
grew
stronger
as
her
body
grew
weaker
and
the
doctors
who
grieved
because
they
could
do
so
little
with
their
skill
were
never
confronted
by
that
malady
of
the
spirit
a
desire
for
ease
and
laziness
which
makes
the
soundest
of
bodies
useless
and
complaining
the
thought
of
her
blooms
in
one
mind
like
the
whitest
of
flowers
it
makes
one
braver
and
more
thankful
to
remember
the
simple
faith
and
patience
with
which
she
bore
her
pain
and
trouble
how
often
she
must
have
said
i
wish
i
could
do
something
for
you
in
return
when
she
was
doing
a
thousand
times
more
than
if
like
her
neighbors
she
followed
the
simple
round
of
daily
life
she
was
doing
constant
kindness
by
her
example
but
nobody
can
tell
the
woe
of
her
long
days
and
nights
the
solitude
of
her
spirit
as
she
was
being
lifted
by
such
hard
ways
to
the
knowledge
of
higher
truth
and
experience
think
of
her
pain
when
one
after
another
her
children
fell
ill
and
died
and
she
could
not
tend
them
and
now
in
the
same
worn
chair
where
she
lived
and
slept
sat
her
husband
helpless
too
thinking
of
her
and
missing
her
more
than
if
she
had
been
sometimes
away
from
home
like
other
women
even
a
stranger
would
miss
her
in
the
house
there
sat
the
old
farmer
looking
down
the
lane
in
his
turn
bearing
his
afflictions
with
a
patient
sterness
that
may
have
been
born
of
watching
his
wife
serenity
there
was
a
rose
lying
within
his
reach
some
days
nobody
came
up
the
lane
and
the
wild
birds
that
ventured
near
the
house
and
the
clouds
that
blew
over
were
his
only
entertainment
he
had
a
fine
face
of
the
older
new
england
type
and
a
type
that
is
fast
passing
away
he
might
have
been
a
cumberland
dalesman
such
were
his
dignity
and
and
english
soberness
of
manner
his
large
frame
was
built
for
hard
work
for
lifting
great
weights
and
pushing
his
plough
through
land
we
felt
at
home
together
and
each
knew
many
things
that
the
other
did
of
earlier
days
and
of
losses
that
had
come
with
time
i
remembered
coming
to
the
old
house
often
in
my
childhood
it
was
in
this
very
farm
lane
that
i
first
saw
anemones
and
learned
what
to
call
them
after
we
drove
away
this
crippled
man
must
have
thought
a
long
time
about
my
elders
and
betters
as
if
he
were
reading
their
story
out
of
a
book
i
suppose
he
has
hauled
many
a
stick
of
timber
pine
down
for
and
gone
through
the
village
so
early
in
the
winter
morning
that
i
waking
in
my
warm
bed
only
heard
the
sleds
creak
through
the
frozen
snow
as
the
slow
oxen
plodded
by
near
the
house
a
trout
brook
comes
plashing
over
the
ledges
at
one
place
there
is
a
most
exquisite
waterfall
to
which
neither
brush
nor
writer
pen
can
do
justice
the
sunlight
falls
through
flickering
leaves
into
the
deep
glen
and
makes
the
foam
whiter
and
the
brook
more
you
can
hear
the
merry
noise
of
it
all
night
all
day
in
the
house
a
little
way
above
the
farmstead
it
comes
through
marshy
ground
which
i
fear
has
been
the
cause
of
much
illness
and
sorrow
to
the
poor
troubled
family
i
had
a
thrill
of
pain
as
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
brook
was
mocking
at
all
that
trouble
with
all
its
wild
carelessness
and
loud
laughter
as
it
hurried
away
down
the
glen
when
we
had
said
and
were
turning
the
horses
away
there
suddenly
appeared
in
a
footpath
that
led
down
from
one
of
the
green
hills
the
young
grandchild
just
coming
home
from
school
she
was
as
quick
as
a
bird
and
as
shy
in
her
little
pink
gown
and
balanced
herself
on
one
foot
like
a
flower
the
brother
was
the
elder
of
the
two
orphans
he
was
the
old
man
delight
and
dependence
by
day
while
his
hired
man
was
afield
the
sober
country
boy
had
learned
to
wait
and
tend
and
the
young
people
were
indeed
a
joy
in
that
lonely
household
there
was
no
sign
that
they
ever
played
like
other
children
no
in
the
yard
no
doll
no
bits
of
broken
crockery
in
order
on
a
rock
they
had
learned
a
fashion
of
life
from
their
elders
and
already
could
lift
and
carry
their
share
of
the
burdens
of
life
it
was
a
country
of
wild
flowers
the
last
of
the
columbines
were
clinging
to
the
hillsides
down
in
the
small
fenced
meadows
belonging
to
the
farm
were
meadow
rue
just
coming
in
flower
and
red
and
white
clover
the
golden
buttercups
were
thicker
than
the
grass
while
many
mulleins
were
standing
straight
and
slender
among
the
pine
stumps
with
their
first
blossoms
atop
rudbeckias
had
found
their
way
in
and
appeared
more
than
ever
like
bold
foreigners
their
names
should
be
translated
into
country
speech
and
the
children
ought
to
call
them
by
way
of
relating
them
to
and
the
pasture
grass
was
green
and
thick
after
the
plentiful
rains
and
the
busy
cattle
took
little
notice
of
us
as
they
browsed
steadily
and
tinkled
their
pleasant
bells
looking
off
the
smooth
round
back
of
great
hill
caught
the
sunlight
with
its
fields
of
young
grain
and
all
the
long
wooded
slopes
and
valleys
were
fresh
and
fair
in
the
june
weather
away
toward
the
blue
new
hampshire
hills
on
the
northern
horizon
seaward
stood
agamenticus
dark
with
its
pitch
pines
and
the
far
sea
itself
blue
and
calm
ruled
the
uneven
country
with
its
unchangeable
line
out
on
the
white
rose
road
again
we
saw
more
of
the
than
ever
and
now
and
then
a
carefully
tended
flower
garden
always
delightful
to
see
and
think
about
these
are
not
made
by
merely
looking
through
a
florist
catalogue
and
ordering
this
or
that
new
seedling
and
a
proper
selection
of
bulbs
or
shrubs
everything
in
a
country
garden
has
its
history
and
personal
association
the
old
bushes
the
perennials
are
apt
to
have
most
tender
relationship
with
the
hands
that
planted
them
long
ago
there
is
a
constant
exchange
of
such
treasures
between
the
neighbors
and
in
the
spring
slips
and
cuttings
may
be
seen
rooting
on
the
window
ledges
while
the
house
plants
give
endless
work
all
winter
long
since
they
need
careful
protection
against
frost
in
long
nights
of
the
severe
weather
a
woman
brings
back
from
every
one
of
her
infrequent
journeys
some
treasure
of
or
a
huge
miscellaneous
nosegay
time
to
work
in
the
little
plot
of
is
hardly
won
by
the
busy
mistress
of
the
farmhouse
the
most
appealing
collection
of
flowering
plants
and
vines
that
i
ever
saw
was
in
virginia
once
above
the
exquisite
valley
spanned
by
the
natural
bridge
a
valley
far
too
little
known
or
praised
i
had
noticed
an
old
log
house
as
i
learned
to
know
the
outlook
from
the
picturesque
hotel
and
was
sure
that
it
must
give
a
charming
view
from
its
perch
on
the
summit
of
a
hill
one
day
i
went
there
one
april
day
when
the
whole
landscape
was
full
of
color
from
the
budding
trees
and
before
i
could
look
at
the
view
i
caught
sight
of
some
rare
vines
already
in
leaf
about
the
dilapidated
walls
of
the
cabin
then
across
the
low
paling
i
saw
the
brilliant
colors
of
tulips
and
daffodils
there
were
many
in
fact
the
whole
top
of
the
hill
was
a
flower
garden
once
well
cared
for
and
carefully
ordered
it
was
all
the
work
of
an
old
woman
of
descent
who
had
been
busy
with
the
cares
of
life
and
a
very
hard
worker
yet
i
was
told
that
to
gratify
her
love
for
flowers
she
would
often
go
afoot
many
miles
over
those
rough
virginia
roads
with
a
root
or
cutting
from
her
own
garden
to
barter
for
a
new
rose
or
a
brighter
blossom
of
some
sort
with
which
she
would
return
in
triumph
i
fancied
that
sometimes
she
had
to
go
by
night
on
these
charming
quests
i
could
see
her
small
figure
setting
forth
down
the
steep
path
when
she
had
a
good
conscience
toward
her
housekeeping
and
the
children
were
in
order
to
be
left
i
am
sure
that
her
friends
thought
of
her
when
they
were
away
from
home
and
could
bring
her
an
offering
of
something
rare
alas
she
had
grown
too
old
and
feeble
to
care
for
her
dear
blossoms
any
longer
and
had
been
forced
to
go
to
live
with
a
married
son
i
dare
say
that
she
was
thinking
of
her
garden
that
very
day
and
wondering
if
this
plant
or
that
were
not
in
bloom
and
perhaps
had
a
heartache
at
the
thought
that
her
tenants
the
careless
colored
children
might
tread
the
young
shoots
of
peony
and
rose
and
make
havoc
in
the
it
was
an
uncommon
collection
made
by
years
of
patient
toil
and
i
thought
of
that
deserted
southern
garden
as
i
followed
my
own
new
england
road
the
were
in
gay
bloom
all
along
the
way
almost
every
house
had
some
flowers
before
it
sometimes
carefully
fenced
about
by
stakes
and
barrel
staves
from
the
miscreant
hens
and
chickens
which
lurked
everywhere
and
liked
a
good
scratch
and
fluffing
in
soft
earth
this
year
as
well
as
any
other
the
world
seemed
full
of
young
life
there
were
calves
tethered
in
pleasant
shady
spots
and
puppies
and
kittens
adventuring
from
the
the
trees
were
full
of
birds
bobolinks
and
and
and
golden
robins
and
sometimes
a
thrush
for
the
afternoon
was
wearing
late
we
passed
the
spring
which
famous
spot
in
the
early
settlement
of
the
country
but
many
of
its
old
traditions
are
now
forgotten
one
of
the
omnipresent
regicides
of
charles
the
first
is
believed
to
have
hidden
himself
for
a
long
time
under
a
great
rock
close
by
the
story
runs
that
he
made
his
miserable
home
in
this
den
for
several
years
but
i
believe
that
there
is
no
record
that
more
than
three
of
the
regicides
escaped
to
this
country
and
their
wanderings
are
otherwise
accounted
for
there
is
a
firm
belief
that
one
of
them
came
to
york
and
was
the
ancestor
of
many
persons
now
living
there
but
i
do
not
know
whether
he
can
have
been
the
hero
of
the
baker
spring
hermitage
beside
we
stopped
to
drink
some
of
the
delicious
water
which
never
fails
to
flow
cold
and
clear
under
the
shade
of
a
great
oak
and
were
amused
with
the
sight
of
a
flock
of
gay
little
country
children
who
passed
by
in
deep
conversation
what
could
such
atoms
of
humanity
be
talking
about
old
times
said
john
the
master
of
horse
with
instant
decision
we
met
now
and
then
a
man
or
woman
who
stopped
to
give
us
hospitable
greeting
but
there
was
no
staying
for
visits
lest
the
daylight
might
fail
us
it
was
delightful
to
find
this
neighborhood
so
thriving
and
populous
for
a
few
days
before
i
had
driven
over
three
miles
of
road
and
passed
only
one
house
that
was
tenanted
and
six
cellars
or
crumbling
chimneys
where
good
farmhouses
had
been
the
lilacs
blooming
in
solitude
and
the
fields
cleared
with
so
much
difficulty
a
century
or
two
ago
all
going
back
to
the
original
woodland
from
which
they
were
won
what
would
the
old
farmers
say
to
see
the
fate
of
their
worthy
bequest
to
the
younger
generation
they
would
wag
their
heads
sorrowfully
with
sad
foreboding
after
we
had
passed
more
woodland
and
a
quarry
where
for
a
wonder
the
derrick
was
not
creaking
and
not
a
single
hammer
was
clinking
at
the
stone
wedges
we
did
not
see
any
one
hoeing
in
the
fields
as
we
had
seen
so
many
on
the
white
rose
road
the
other
side
of
the
hills
presently
we
met
two
or
three
people
walking
sedately
clad
in
their
best
clothes
there
was
a
subdued
air
of
public
excitement
and
concern
and
one
of
us
remembered
that
there
had
been
a
death
in
the
neighborhood
this
was
the
day
of
the
funeral
the
man
had
been
known
to
us
in
former
years
we
had
an
instinct
to
hide
our
unsympathetic
pleasuring
but
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
except
to
follow
our
homeward
road
straight
by
the
house
the
occasion
was
nearly
ended
by
this
time
the
borrowed
chairs
were
being
set
out
in
the
yard
in
little
groups
even
the
funeral
supper
had
been
eaten
and
the
brothers
and
sisters
and
near
relatives
of
the
departed
man
were
just
going
home
the
new
grave
showed
plainly
out
in
the
green
field
near
by
he
had
belonged
to
one
of
the
ancient
families
of
the
region
long
settled
on
this
old
farm
by
the
narrow
river
they
had
given
their
name
to
a
bridge
and
the
bridge
had
christened
the
which
stood
close
by
we
were
much
struck
by
the
solemn
figure
of
the
mother
a
very
old
woman
as
she
walked
toward
her
old
home
with
some
of
her
remaining
children
i
had
not
thought
to
see
her
again
knowing
her
great
age
and
infirmity
she
was
like
a
presence
out
of
the
last
century
tall
and
still
erect
and
of
striking
features
and
a
firm
look
not
modern
but
as
if
her
mind
were
still
set
upon
an
earlier
and
simpler
scheme
of
life
an
air
of
dominion
cloaked
her
finely
she
had
long
been
queen
of
her
surroundings
and
to
her
great
family
royalty
is
a
quality
one
of
nature
gifts
and
there
one
might
behold
it
as
truly
as
if
victoria
regina
imperatrix
had
passed
by
the
natural
instincts
common
to
humanity
were
there
undisguised
unconcealed
simply
accepted
we
had
seen
a
royal
progress
she
was
the
central
figure
of
that
rural
society
as
you
looked
at
the
little
group
you
could
see
her
only
now
that
she
came
abroad
so
rarely
her
presence
was
not
without
deep
significance
and
so
she
took
her
homeward
way
with
a
primitive
kind
of
majesty
it
was
evident
that
the
neighborhood
was
in
great
excitement
and
quite
thrown
out
of
its
usual
placidity
an
acquaintance
came
from
a
small
house
farther
down
the
road
and
we
stopped
for
a
word
with
him
we
spoke
of
the
funeral
and
were
told
something
of
the
man
who
had
died
yes
and
there
a
man
layin
very
sick
here
said
our
friend
in
an
excited
whisper
he
wo
last
but
a
day
or
two
there
another
man
buried
yesterday
that
was
struck
by
lightnin
comin
acrost
a
field
when
that
great
shower
begun
the
lightnin
stove
through
his
hat
and
run
down
all
over
him
and
ploughed
a
spot
in
the
ground
there
was
a
knot
of
people
about
the
door
the
minister
of
that
scattered
parish
stood
among
them
and
they
all
looked
at
us
eagerly
as
if
we
too
might
be
carrying
news
of
a
fresh
disaster
through
the
countryside
somehow
the
melancholy
tales
did
not
touch
our
sympathies
as
they
ought
and
we
could
not
see
the
pathetic
side
of
them
as
at
another
time
the
day
was
so
full
of
cheer
and
the
sky
and
earth
so
glorious
the
very
fields
looked
busy
with
their
early
summer
growth
the
horses
began
to
think
of
the
clack
of
the
cover
and
we
were
hurried
along
between
the
silvery
willows
and
the
rustling
alders
taking
time
to
gather
a
handful
of
conserve
roses
by
the
roadside
and
where
the
highway
made
a
long
bend
eastward
among
the
farms
two
of
us
left
the
carriage
and
followed
a
footpath
along
the
green
river
bank
and
through
the
pastures
coming
out
to
the
road
again
only
a
minute
later
than
the
horses
i
believe
that
it
is
an
old
indian
trail
followed
from
the
salmon
falls
farther
down
the
river
where
the
indians
came
to
dry
the
plentiful
fish
for
their
winter
supplies
i
have
traced
the
greater
part
of
this
footpath
which
goes
straight
as
an
arrow
across
the
country
the
first
trail
being
from
the
falls
where
mason
settlers
came
in
and
built
their
great
works
of
a
with
a
gang
of
saws
and
presently
a
grist
mill
beside
to
emery
bridge
i
should
like
to
follow
the
old
footpath
still
farther
i
found
part
of
it
by
accident
a
long
time
ago
once
as
you
came
close
to
the
river
you
were
sure
to
find
fishermen
scattered
along
sometimes
i
myself
have
been
discovered
but
it
is
not
much
use
to
go
fishing
any
more
if
some
person
would
kindly
be
the
frank
buckland
of
new
england
and
try
to
have
the
laws
enforced
that
protect
the
inland
fisheries
he
would
do
his
country
great
service
years
ago
there
were
so
many
salmon
that
as
an
enthusiastic
old
friend
once
assured
me
you
could
walk
across
on
them
below
the
falls
but
now
they
are
unknown
simply
because
certain
substances
which
would
enrich
the
farms
are
thrown
from
factories
and
tanneries
into
our
clear
new
england
streams
good
river
fish
are
growing
very
scarce
the
smelts
and
bass
and
shad
have
all
left
this
upper
branch
of
the
piscataqua
as
the
salmon
left
it
long
ago
and
the
supply
of
one
necessary
sort
of
good
cheap
food
is
lost
to
a
growing
community
for
the
lack
of
a
little
thought
and
care
in
the
factory
companies
and
and
the
building
in
some
cases
of
over
the
dams
i
think
that
the
need
of
preaching
against
this
bad
economy
is
very
great
the
sight
of
a
proud
lad
with
a
string
of
undersized
trout
will
scatter
half
the
idlers
in
town
into
the
pastures
next
day
but
everybody
patiently
accepts
the
depopulation
of
a
fine
clear
river
where
the
tide
comes
fresh
from
the
sea
to
be
tainted
by
the
spoiled
stream
which
started
from
its
mountain
sources
as
pure
as
heart
could
wish
man
has
done
his
best
to
ruin
the
world
he
lives
in
one
is
tempted
to
say
at
impulsive
first
thought
but
after
all
as
i
mounted
the
last
hill
before
reaching
the
village
the
houses
took
on
a
new
look
of
comfort
and
pleasantness
the
fields
that
i
knew
so
well
were
a
fresher
green
than
before
the
sun
was
down
and
the
provocations
of
the
day
seemed
very
slight
compared
to
the
satisfaction
i
believed
that
with
a
little
more
time
we
should
grow
wiser
about
our
fish
and
other
things
beside
it
will
be
good
to
remember
the
white
rose
road
and
its
quietness
in
many
a
busy
town
day
to
come
as
i
think
of
these
slight
sketches
i
wonder
if
they
will
have
to
others
a
tinge
of
sadness
but
i
have
seldom
spent
an
afternoon
so
full
of
pleasure
and
fresh
and
delighted
consciousness
of
the
possibilities
of
rural
life
