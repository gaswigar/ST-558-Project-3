you

this
very
sec
quick
hurry
stir
your
old
bones
ca
you
the
two
girls
who
had
been
standing
in
the
ruined
that
spanned
the
gateway
tore
down
the
broken
corkscrew
staircase
at
a
speed
calculated
to
imperil
their
necks
seriously
and
reached
the
bottom
at
the
identical
moment
that
a
motor
rounded
the
corner
and
drew
up
in
front
of
the
entrance
sixteen
jolly
faces
were
grinning
under
sixteen
school
hats
and
at
least
a
dozen
excited
voices
were
pouring
forth
a
perfect
babel
of
exclamations
how
ripping
oh
i
say
this
is
what
a
chubby
place
i
no
idea
it
would
be
like
this
oh
hold
me
up
this
child
knocked
me
over
entirely
the
opening
day
of
a
fresh
term
is
always
more
or
less
of
an
event
but
this
particular
reunion
was
a
thrillingly
important
occasion
for
during
the
easter
holidays
the
school
had
removed
and
the
girls
were
now
having
their
first
peep
at
their
new
quarters
the
vision
that
greeted
them
through
the
old
gateway
was
certainly
calculated
to
justify
their
ecstatic
remarks
a
grassy
courtyard
interspersed
with
flower
beds
and
flagged
footpaths
led
to
a
large
gray
old
tudor
house
whose
mullioned
windows
twisted
chimney
stacks
irregular
roof
ivied
stone
balls
and
carved
porch
offered
the
very
utmost
of
the
romantic
and
picturesque
the
change
from
the
humdrum
ordinary
surroundings
of
their
former
school
was
supreme
miss
beasley
had
promised
them
a
pleasant
surprise
and
she
had
undoubtedly
kept
her
word
the
sixteen
new
arrivals
grasped
their
handbags
and
small
possessions
and
set
off
up
the
flagged
pathway
with
delight
written
large
on
their
countenances
raymonde
armitage
and
aveline
kerby
in
virtue
of
half
an
hour
longer
acquaintance
with
the
premises
trotted
alongside
and
did
the
honours
yes
it
topping
regular
old
country
mansion
sort
of
a
place
might
have
come
straight
out
of
a

you
should
see
the

bee
i
can
tell
you
she
pleased
with
life
buzzing
about
no
end
even
the
wasp
got
a
smile
on

you
need
look
so
incredulous

raymonde
the
wasp
quite
jinky
actually
said
dear
to
me
when
i
arrived
of
course
mother
was
there
but
even
then
it
gave
me
spasms
gibbie
of
all
people
in
this
wide
world
to
call
me
dear
i
nearly
collapsed
what
next
i
thought
will
never
cease
gibbie
certainly
not
given

trotting
out

names
even
before
parents
chirruped
morvyth

perhaps
she
striking
out
a
new

and
we
shall
all
be
and
now
do
you
alarm
yourself
she
could
twist
her
tongue
round
them
i
think
she
was
pining
away
to
an
early
death
if
she
did
hear
plenty
of
plain
straight
wholesome
before
half
an
hour
older
my
child
or
else
i
entirely
mistaken

you
mended

morvyth
are
you

would
die
of

if
i
did
you
be
positively
bored
to
tears
no
we
all
have
our
talents
and
i
consider
my
mission
in
life
is
to
keep
things
humming
and
cheer
you
all
up
i
may
do
it
at

personal
sacrifice

you

ca
row
us
all
at
once
and
when
i
draw
fire
on
myself
i

you

i
a
kind
of
scapegoat
for

sins

gibbie
lets
forth
the
vials
of
her
wrath
the
storm
over
she
feels
better
and
nobody
else
is
much
the
worse
not
even
you
you
heroic
victim
bless
you

i
as
used
to
scolding
as

to

neither
the
bumble
bee
nor
the

worry
me
i
let
them
both
buzz
it
seems
to
please
them
indeed
i
think
they
expect
it
when
one
got
a
reputation
one
bound
to
live
up
to
it
raymonde
armitage
would
certainly
not
have
won
a
medal
for
exemplary
behaviour
had
any
such
prize
been
offered
at
the
school
there
was
no
harm
in
her
but
her
irrepressible
spirits
were
continually
at
effervescing
point
and
in
fizzing
over
were
liable
to
burst
into
outbreaks
of
a
nature
highly
scandalizing
to
the
authorities
as
regarded
miss
beasley
the
principal
though
she
upheld
discipline
firmly
it
was
an
open
secret
that
she
had
a
sneaking
weakness
for
raymonde
the
bumble
bee
rows
ray
but
she
likes
her
was
the
general
verdict
with
miss
gibbs
however
it
was
a
different
matter
the
humour
of
a
situation
never
appealed
to
her
she
frankly
considered
her
troublesome
pupil
as
a
thorn
in
the
flesh
and
perhaps
gave
her
credit
for
more
than
she
really
deserved
in
the
way
of
blame
it
was
whispered
in
the
school
that
several
enterprising
spirits
had
managed
to
shift
on
to
raymonde
shoulders
the
consequences
of
their
own
crimes
with
results
more
satisfactory
to
themselves
than
to
their
lively
classmate
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
she
had
passed
her
fifteenth
birthday
raymonde
was
the
most
irresponsible
creature
in
the
world
she
looked
it
her
face
was
as
round
and
smooth
as
an
infant
with
an
absurd
little
dab
of
a
nose
a
mouth
with
baby
dimples
at
the
corners
and
small
white
teeth
that
seemed
more
like
first
than
second
ones
and
dark
eyes
which
when
they
did
not
happen
to
be
twinkling
were
capable
of
putting
on
a
bewitching
innocence
of
expression
calculated
to
deceive
almost
any
teacher
however
experienced
save
the
miss
gibbs
at
the
beginning
of
this
term
there
were
girls
in
the
little
community
assembled
at
marlowe
grange
the
old
house
provided
ample
accommodation
and
had
been
easily
adapted
to
meet
the
wants
of
a
school
built
originally
in
elizabethan
days
it
had
been
added
to
at
various
times
and
its
medley
of
architecture
while
hopelessly
confusing
styles
had
resulted
in
a
very
picturesque
and
charming
whole
perhaps
the
most
ancient
part
was
the
fortified
gateway
ruinous
and
covered
with
ivy
but
still
preserving
its
winding
stair
leading
to
an
upper
story
that
spanned
the
entrance
with
its
tiny
loophole
windows
and
its
great
solid
oak
gate
with
the
little
door
cut
through
it
had
the
aspect
of
a
medi√¶val
fortress
and
was
a
fitting
introduction
to
what
was
to
follow
high
walls
on
both
sides
enclosed
the
courtyard
and
farther
on
to
the
right
of
the
house
was
another
quaint
garden
where
shaved
yew
trees
and
clipped
hollies
presented
distorted
imitations
of
peacocks
umbrellas
pagodas
or
other
ambitious
examples
of
topiary
art
here
in
the
late
april
weather
spring
bulbs
were
blooming
wallflowers
made
a
sheet
of
gold
and
the
pear
trees
were
opening
pure
white
blossoms
little
clumps
of
pansies
pink
daisies
and
were
struggling
up
rather
mixed
amongst
the
box
edging
and
a
bank
of
white
alyssum
on
the
rockery
near
the
hives
provided
a
feast
of
nectar
for
the
bees
whose
drowsy
hum
seemed
to
hold
all
the
promise
of
the
coming
summer
behind
this
garden
and
sheltered
by
the
outbuildings
from
the
north
and
east
winds
lay
the
orchard
neglected
and
unpruned
but
very
beautiful
with
its
apple
trees
its
straggling
plums
and
budding
walnuts
and
cherries
just
bursting
into
an
ethereal
fairy
network
of
delicate
palest
pink
bloom
primroses
grew
here
amongst
the
grass
and
clumps
of
dog
violets
and
little
tufts
of
bluebells
were
pushing
their
way
up
to
take
the
place
of
the
fading
daffodils
while
a
blackthorn
bush
was
a
mass
of
pure
white
stars
at
the
far
end
instead
of
a
hedge
lay
the
moat
a
shallow
stagnant
pool
bordered
with
drooping
willows
tall
reeds
and
rushes
that
reared
their
stems
from
the
dark
oozy
water
originally
this
moat
had
encircled
the
mansion
as
a
means
of
defence
but
now
like
the
ruined
gateway
its
mission
was
long
past
and
it
survived
a
sleepy
witness
to
the
warfare
of
our
forefathers
and
a
picturesque
adjunct
to
the
general
beauty
of
the
place
that
could
scarcely
be
surpassed
from
the
farther
side
of
the
moat
peaceful
meadows
led
to
the
river
where
between
high
wooded
banks
a
stately
silver
stream
glided
slowly
and
tranquilly
on
in
its
path
towards
the
ocean
rippling
over
weirs
and
bearing
on
its
calm
bosom
an
occasional
pleasure
boat
punt
or
fussy
little
motor
yacht
the
interior
of
the
old
grange
was
quaint
as
its
exterior
the
large
rooms
lent
themselves
admirably
to
school
uses
the
big
hall
with
its
walls
windows
and
huge
fireplace
made
an
excellent
or
when
the
forms
were
moved
to
one
end
provided
plenty
of
space
for
drilling
or
dancing
it
seemed
strange
certainly
to
turn
an
elizabethan
bedroom
into
a
and
standard
desks
looked
decidedly
at
variance
with
the
carved
or
the
stags
antlers
that
still
ornamented
the
walls
but
the
modern
element
only
seemed
to
enhance
the
old
and
the
girls
agreed
that
nothing
could
be
more
suitable
than
to
learn
history
in
such
a
setting
it
give
us
a
loophole
for
lots
of
our
lessons
remarked
raymonde
hopefully
as
she
personally
conducted
a
party
of
new
arrivals
over
the
establishment
for
instance
if
i
get
muddled
over
circulating
decimals
i
explain
that
my
brains
fall
naturally
into
a
medi√¶val
groove
in
these
surroundings
and
decimals
were
invented
then
so
that
of
course
it
impossible
for
me
to
grasp
them
and
the
same
with
geography
the
map
of
africa
then
had
about
three
names
on
it
so
quite
superfluous
to
try
to
remember
any
more
i
going
to
cultivate
the
mental
atmosphere
of
the
place
and
focus
my
mind
accordingly
concentrate
on
the
elizabethan
period
of
history
and
the
rest
just
ignore
do
know
how
you
convince
gibbie
chuckled
muriel
fuller
you
leave
gibbie
to
me
my
mind
seething
with
ideas
absolutely
chock
full
i
see
possibilities
that
i
never
even
dreamt
of
at
the
old
school
i
believe
this
term
going
to
be
the
time
of
my
life
bless
the
dear
old
bumble
bee
she
buzzed
to
some
purpose
in
bringing
us
here
perhaps
what
struck
the
girls
most
of
all
was
the
large
dormitory
in
the
days
of
the
french
revolution
marlowe
grange
had
been
the
refuge
of
an
order
of
nuns
who
had
escaped
from
limoges
and
founded
a
temporary
convent
in
the
old
house
it
was
owing
to
the
excellence
of
their
arrangements
and
the
structural
improvements
which
they
had
left
behind
them
that
the
grange
had
been
so
eminently
suitable
for
a
school
seven
little
bedrooms
placed
side
by
side
served
exactly
to
accommodate
the
members
of
the
sixth
form
while
the
great
chamber
running
from
end
to
end
of
the
house
with
its
nineteen
beds
provided
quarters
for
the
rank
and
file
just
for
a
moment
the
girls
had
stared
rather
aghast
at
their
vast
dormitory
contrasting
it
with
the
numerous
small
rooms
of
their
former
school
but
the
possibilities
of
fun
presented
by
this
congregation
of
beds
outweighed
the
disadvantages
and
they
had
decided
that
the
arrangement
was
topping
it
had
however
one
serious
drawback
at
the
far
end
was
a
small
extra
chamber
intended
originally
for
the
use
of
the
mother
superior
of
the
convent
and
here
to
the
girls
infinite
dismay
miss
gibbs
had
taken
up
her
abode
there
was
no
mistake
about
it
her
box
blocked
the
doorway
her
bag
labelled
gibbs
passenger
to
great
marlowe
via
littleton
junction
reposed
upon
a
chair
her
hat
and
coat
lay
on
the
bed
and
a
neat
of
classes
was
already
pinned
upon
the
wall
we
did
bargain
to
have
the
wasp
at
such
close
quarters
whispered
ardiune
ruefully
she
sleep
with
both
ears
open
and
if
we
stir
a
finger
or
breathe
a
word
she
hear
cheero
there
are
ways
of
making
people
deaf
remarked
raymonde
sanguinely
how
ah
my
child
that
a
surprise
for
the
future
suppose
with
a
cryptic
shake
of
the
head
i
going
to
give
away
my
professional
secrets
i
told
you
already
it
my
mission
to
enliven
this
school
and
if
you
do
have
a
jinky
term
i
consider
myself
a
failure
have
i
started
well
i
arrived
half
an
hour
before
everyone
else
and
booked
up
all
the
beds
on
the
far
side
for
our
set
here
you
are
a
label
pinned
to
each
pillow
the
six
kindred
spirits
who
revolved
as
satellites
in
raymonde
orbit
turned
to
her
with
a
gush
of
admiration
it
was
a
brilliant
thought
to
have
labelled
the
beds
and
so
secured
the
most
eligible
portion
of
the
dormitory
for
themselves
you
the
limit
ray
gurgled
aveline
aveline
was
generally
regarded
as
raymonde
she
was
not
so
clever
so
daring
or
so
altogether
reckless
but
she
came
in
a
very
good
in
most
of
the
escapades
she
could
always
be
relied
upon
for
support
could
keep
a
secret
and
had
a
peculiarly
convenient
knack
of
baffling
awkward
questions
by
putting
on
an
attitude
of
utter
stolidity
when
her
eyes
were
under
their
heavy
lids
and
her
mouth
wore
what
the
girls
called
its
john
bull
expression
not
even
miss
beasley
herself
could
drag
information
out
of
aveline
the
sphinx
as
she
was
sometimes
nicknamed
prided
herself
on
her
accomplishment
and
took
particular
care
to
maintain
her
character
raymonde
had
apportioned
the
bed
on
her
right
to
aveline
and
that
on
her
left
to
fauvette
robinson
who
occupied
about
an
equal
place
in
her
affections
fauvette
was
a
little
clinging

her
school
career
fauvette
was
one
of
those
girls
who
all
their
lives
lean
upon
somebody
and
at
present
she
had
twined
herself
an
ornamental
piece
of
honeysuckle
round
the
stout
oak
prop
of
raymonde
stronger
personality
she
was
a
dear
amiable
little
soul
highly
romantic
and
sentimental
with
a
pretty
soprano
voice
and
just
a
sufficient
talent
for
acting
to
make
her
absolutely
invaluable
in
scenes
from
dickens
or
jane
austen
where
a
heroine
of
the
innocent
pleading
pathetic
babyish
early
victorian
type
was
required
a
more
spicy
character
was
morvyth
holmes
otherwise
the
kipper
her
pale
face
and
shining
hazel
eyes
showed
cleverness
when
she
cared
to
work
she
could
astonish
her
form
and
her
teacher
but
her
energy
came
in
such
odd
bursts
and
with
such
long
lapses
between
that
it
did
not
in
the
aggregate
amount
to
much
it
was
rumoured
in
the
school
that
miss
beasley
had
her
eye
on
morvyth
as
a
possible
candidate
for
public
examinations
and
in
fear
lest
such
an
honour
might
be
thrust
upon
her
morvyth
was
careful
to
avoid
the
display
of
too
deep
erudition
it
would
do
she
assured
her
chums
catch
me
swatting
for
the
senior
oxford
like
poor
old
meta
and
daphne
i
tell
you
those
girls
will
hardly
enjoy
a
decent
game
of
tennis
this
term
the
bumble
got
their
wretched
noses
on
the
grindstone
and
they
have
a
blighting
time
till
the
affair
over
no
i
a
wary
bird
and
not
going
to
be
decoyed
into
an
intellectual
trap
and
dished
up
for

not
even
the
essay
prize
shall
tempt
me
you
may
win
it
yourself
ray
if
you
like
poor
old
kipper
murmured
raymonde
it
a
little
rough
on
you
that
you
dare
exhibit
your
talents
ca
you
show
a
certificate
prohibiting
you
from
entering
for
public
exams
and
limiting
your
the
kind
of
thing
one
brings
back
to
school
after
scarlet
fever
you
know
morvyth
shook
her
head
dolefully
it
no
go
the
bumble
would
be
capable
of
sending
for
the
doctor
and
thrashing
the
matter
out
with
him
my
only
safety
lies
in
modesty
no
school
laurels

me
they
cost

dear
valentine
gorton
and
ardiune
known
familiarly
as
salt
and
pepper
were
inseparable
friends
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
they
quarrelled
on
an
average
at
least
three
times
a
day
their
tiffs
were
very
easily
made
up
however
and
they
always
supported
each
other
in
upsets
with
anyone
else
merging
what
might
be
termed
tribal
disputes
in
national
warfare
being
well
supplied
from
home
with
chocolates
and
liberal
in
their
dispensation
they
were
favourites
in
their
form
and
indeed
throughout
the
school
wore
the
hallmark
of
popularity
raymonde
particular
set
of
chums
was
completed
by
katherine
harding
a
damsel
whose
demure
looks
belied
her
character
katherine
innocent
grey
eyes
and
complexion
were
the
vineyards
that
hide
the
volcano
she
could
always
be
relied
upon
to
support
any
enterprising
project
or
interesting
hoax
that
was
presented
for
her
approval
these
seven
comrades
close
chums
in
the
past
banded
themselves
together
anew
to
enjoy
life
to
the
best
of
their
ability
and
to
obtain
the
maximum
of
fun
and
diversion
out
of
the
forthcoming
term
it
is
with
their
immediate
adventures
that
this
book
is
largely
concerned
chapter
ii
the
mystic
seven
know
said
morvyth
flopping
down
disgustedly
on
to
a
form
and
addressing
an
interested
audience
of
three
know
my
children
that
i
consider
these
two
new
girls
the
very
limit
absolute
blighters
agreed
raymonde
hastily
i
was
thinking
so
myself
only
this
morning
i
ca
decide
which
is
the
worst
not
a
pin
to
choose
between
them
commented
aveline
with
a
yawn
i
gave
cynthia
greene
credit
for
shyness
during
the
first
hours
continued
morvyth
i
thought
in
my
own
mind
poor
thing
is
suffering
no
doubt
from
and
general
confusion
and
we
must
be
gentle
with
her
but
i
kept
a
wary
eye
upon
her
and
come
to
a
conclusion
it
not
shyness
it
swank
ardiune
nodded
her
head
approvingly
swank
and
nothing
else
she
confirmed
i
know
something
about
it
too
for
i
heard
her
expounding
to
her
own
form
this
morning
it
almost
made
me
ill
i
had
to
take
a
run
round
the
garden
before
i
felt
fit
again
it
seems
she
come
from
some
much
smaller
school
where
she
been
the
head
girl
and
show
pupil
and
the
rest
of
it
she
said
the
younger
ones
had
all
looked
up
to
her
and
the
principal
had
treated
her
as
a
friend
and
that
she
always
worked
hard
to
keep
up
the
tone
of
the
place
o
sophonisba
ejaculated
raymonde
well
it
strikes
me
we
got
the
tone
of
this
school
to
look
after
we
ca
allow
fourth
form
kids
to
bring
those
notions
and
run
them
here
she
wo
find
herself
queen
of
this
establishment
hardly
chuckled
aveline
are
her
own
form
attending
to
the
matter
enquired
morvyth
naturally
they
giving
her
as
bad
a
time
as
they
know
how
but
they
do
make
much
headway
she
tells
them
she
fully
expects
to
be
ragged
and
she
simply
wo
believe
a
word
they
say
they
taken
her
in
once
yet
that
because
they
not
skilful
said
raymonde
thoughtfully
they
do
do
the
thing
artistically
there
a
finesse
required
for
this
kind
of
work
that
their
stupid
young
heads
do
possess
i
not
sure
if
it
would
be
philanthropic
to
help
them
set
your
own
house
in
order
first
grunted
ardiune
you
have
your
hands
full
with
maudie
heywood
i
not
going
to
neglect
maudie
do
alarm
yourself
she
the
best
specimen
of
the
genus
prig
that
i
ever
come
across
in
the
course
of
my
life
she
ought
to
have
a
form
all
to
herself
instead
of
being
plumped
into
the
fifth
i
see
dangerous
possibilities
in
maudie
do
you
realize
what
she
did
this
morning
learnt
the
whole
of
that
wretched
poem
instead
of
only
the
twenty
lines
that
were
set
us
i
heard
gibbie
complimenting
her
and
thought
she
get
swelled
head
swelled
head
indeed
it
the
principle
that
involved
do
you
see
that
if
this
girl
goes
and
learns
whole
poems
gibbie
think
we
can
do
the
same
and
she
give
us
more
next
time
it
raising
the
standard
of
work
in
the
form
great
minerva
so
it
is
we
have
to
put
a
stopper
on
that
urged
aveline
indignantly
there
are
a
good
many
things
that
have
given
me
spasms
since
i
came
back
proclaimed
raymonde
they
things
that
ought
to
be
set
right
what
i
vote
is
that
our
set
form
ourselves
into
a
sort
of
watch
committee
to
attend
to
any
little
matters
of
this
sort
it
would
be
a
kindness
to
the
school
ardiune
chuckled
softly
by
all
means
let
us
be
the
red
cross
knights
and
go
out
to
right
the
wrong
we
attack
duessa
straight
away
and
teach
her
to
mend
her
morals
you
let
val
be
in
it
rather
and
fauvette
and
katherine
seven
a
mystic
number
you
know
there
were
the
seven
champions
of
christendom
and
there
are
the
seven
ages
of
man
and
the
seven
days
of
creation
and
seven
years
of
apprenticeship
and
and
seven
deadly
sins
suggested
aveline
cheerfully
and
the
seven
vials
and
well
anyhow
it
always
seven
so
we
make
ourselves
into
a
society
we
have
a
star
with
seven
rays
for
our
secret
sign
it
has
a
nice
occult
kind
of
smack
about
it
when
we
chalk
that
mark
upon
anybody
desk
it
means
we
got
to
reform
her
whether
she
likes
it
or
whether
she
does
she
probably
wo
twinkled
ardiune
then
the
sooner
she
submits
the
better
she
find
it
no
use
fighting
against
fate
otherwise
the
mystic
seven
we
start
business
with
cynthia
greene
decided
aveline
fauvette
valentine
and
katherine
were
duly
informed
of
the
existence
of
the
new
society
and
their
initiation
thereinto
they
offered
no
objections
and
indeed
would
have
been
prepared
at
raymonde
request
to
join
a
black
brotherhood
or
a
pirates
league
with
a
skull
and
for
its
emblem
a
special
committee
meeting
was
held
to
discuss
the
matter
of
cynthia
greene
it
needs
finesse
said
morvyth
she
been
to
school
before
and
she
up
to
most
dodges
naturally
she
comprehends
that
her
own
form
are
trying
to
rag
her
that
where
we
come
in
agreed
raymonde
we
going
to
pose
as
philanthropists
one
or
two
of
us
have
got
to
take
cynthia
up
make
her
realize
of
course
how
very
kind
it
is
of
fifth
form
girls
to
befriend
a
lonely
junior
and
having
taken
her
up
what
then
queried
fauvette
bless
your
innocence
child
why
we
let
her
down
with
a
run
are
we
all
in
it
no
it
would
be
too
marked
best
leave
the
affair
to
aveline
and
me
you
others
must
stand
aloof
and
look
disinterested
but
sympathetic
i
speak
to
her
at
during
the
interval
therefore
raymonde
singled
out
her
victim
cynthia
was
standing
slightly
apart
from
her
form
consuming
thick
bread
and
butter
with
an
air
of
pensive
melancholy
and
twisting
a
pet
bracelet
that
adorned
her
wrist
raymonde
strolled
up
casually
getting
on
all
right
she
began
by
way
of
opening
the
attack
i
say
you
know
i
thought
i
just
speak
to
you
i
expect
you
having
a
grizzly
time
with
those
wretched
juniors
they
a
set
of
blighters
are
they
i
do
find
them
a
little
trying
admitted
cynthia
cautiously
especially
as
i
was
head
girl
at
my
old
school
rather
a
from
senior
to
junior
is
it
why
did
miss
beasley
put
you
in
the
fifth
my
mother
asked
her
to
but
she
said
as
i
was
only
thirteen
it
was
quite
impossible
it
all
right
i
expect
to
be
ragged
a
little
at
first
i
live
it
down
in
time
cynthia
expression
of
patient
resignation
was
almost
too
much
for
raymonde
but
she
controlled
her
countenance
and
continued
they
respect
you
all
the
more
afterwards
no
doubt
i
hope
so
we
did
rag
new
girls
at
the
poplars
i
always
made
a
point
of
showing
them
they
were
welcome
it
seemed
only
fair
to
miss
gordon
she
was
more
like
a
personal
friend
than
a
teacher
and
she
looked
to
me
you
see
to
keep
up
the
tone
of
the
school
she
must
be
lost
without
you
i
think
they
miss
me
admitted
cynthia
with
a
little
fluttering
sigh
of
regret
the
girls
all
subscribed
before
i
left
and
gave
me
this
bracelet
as
a
keepsake
it
got
an
inscription
inside
would
you
like
to
look
at
it
cynthia
had
unclasped
her
treasure
and
handed
it
with
an
assumed
nonchalance
for
raymonde
inspection
on
the
gold
band
was
engraved
to
cynthia
greene
a
token
of
esteem
from
her
schoolfellows
highly
gratifying
gurgled
raymonde
it
was
sweet
of
them
was
it
well
i
tried
to
do
my
best
for
them
and
i
do
my
best
for
this
school
too
when
i
get
the
chance
i
in
no
hurry
i
content
to
wait
and
let
the
girls
come
round
quite
the
best
plan
in
the
meantime
if
there
are
any
little
tips
i
can
give
you
come
to
me
thanks
awfully
i
will
i
have
done
the
same
by
you
if
you
been
a
new
girl
at
the
poplars
raymonde
retired
bubbling
over
with
suppressed
mirth
that
girl
the
limit
she
reported
to
her
confederates
for
calm
i
never
seen
anybody
to
equal
her
the
idea
of
imagining
as
a
new
girl
at
her
wretched
pettifogging
old
school
oh
it
too
precious
she
patronize
the
queen
herself
the
poplars
must
be
executing
a
for
joy
to
have
got
rid
of
her
probably
they
have
subscribed
for
more
than
a
bracelet
to
pass
her
on
elsewhere
so
she
waiting
patiently
till
she
wins
the
school
hinnied
aveline
poor
angel
did
you
notice
her
wings
sprouting
or
a
halo
glowing
round
her
head
i
think
we
can
put
her
up
to
a
few
tips
chuckled
ardiune
it
would
only
be
kind
gushed
raymonde
the
sort
of
thing
she
must
have
done
herself
hundreds
of
times
to
many
a
poor
neglected
new
girl
at
the
poplars
the
bread
she
cast
upon
the
waters
shall
be
returned
to
her
with
butter
on
it
added
aveline
she
can
swallow
any
amount
of
butter
observed
raymonde
she
evidently
likes
it
laid
on
thick
suggestions
invited
please
for
kind
and
disinterested
advice
to
be
administered
to
her
professor
marshall
comes
volunteered
aveline
the
very
thing
ave
you
old
sport
you
given
me
an
idea
now
just
prepare
your
minds
for
a
pretty
and
touching
little
scene
at
the
beginning
of
the
medi√¶val
arts
lecture
no
i
sha
tell
you
what
it
is
beforehand
it
be
something
for
you
to
look
forward
to
the
staff
at
marlowe
grange
consisted
of
miss
beasley
miss
gibbs
and
mademoiselle
but
there
were
several
visiting
masters
and
mistresses
who
had
attended
at
the
former
house
and
were
now
to
continue
their
instructions
at
the
school
in
its
present
quarters
among
these
professor
marshall
was
rather
a
favourite
as
befitted
a
teacher
in
an
establishment
of
young
ladies
he
was
and
elderly
and
as
the
girls
added
married
and
guaranteed
not
to
flirt
but
all
the
same
he
was
jolly
had
a
hearty
affable
manner
and
a
habit
of
making
bad
jokes
and
weak
puns
to
break
up
the
monotony
of
his
lectures
it
was
decidedly
the
fashion
to
admire
him
to
snigger
indulgently
at
his
mild
little
pleasantries
and
to
call
him
an
old
dear
some
of
the
girls
even
worked
quite
hard
at
their
preparation
for
him
he
had
written
his
autograph
in
at
least
nineteen
birthday
books
and
it
was
rumoured
that
when
the
auspicious
of
march
had
come
round
no
less
than
fourteen
anonymous
congratulatory
picture
had
been
directed
to
him
from
the
school
and
posted
by
stealth
having
already
improved
their
minds
upon
a
course
of
english
classics
and
astronomy
the
school
this
term
was
booked
for
culture
and
devoted
to
the
study
of
the
fine
arts
of
the
middle
ages
a
few
selected
members
of
the
sixth
had
been
told
off
to
search
through
back
numbers
of
and
for
examples
of
the
paintings
of
cimabue
and
giotto
and
the
large
engraving
of
botticelli
spring
which
used
to
hang
in
miss
beasley
study
now
occupied
a
prominent
position
on
the
wall
to
afford
a
mental
feast
during
raymonde
anxious
not
to
overdo
things
left
cynthia
to
herself
for
the
rest
of
the
day
but
the
following
morning
after
breakfast
she
seized
an
opportunity
for
a
few
words
with
her
you
wo
mind
my
giving
you
a
hint
or
two
on
school
etiquette
she
observed
casually
you
see
there
are
traditions
in
every
school
that
one
likes
to
keep
up
and
of
course
you
ca
find
them
out
unless
you
told
i
be
very
glad
gushed
cynthia
gratefully
we
a
regular
code
at
the
poplars
and
i
used
to
initiate
everybody
they
always
came
straight
to
me
and
i
coached
them
up
i
ca
tell
you
how
many
new
girls
i
helped
in
my
time
well
you
new
yourself
now
said
raymonde
detaching
mind
from
these
reminiscences
of
past
service
and
bringing
it
up
to
date
professor
marshall
coming
and
you
have
to
be
introduced
to
him
oh
dear
i
so
shy
i
wonder
what
he
think
of
me
fluttered
cynthia
think
you
the
sickliest
idiot
he
ever
met
was
on
the
tip
of
raymonde
tongue
but
she
restrained
herself
and
drawing
her
victim
aside
whispered
honeyed
words
calculated
to
soothe
and
cheer
adding
some
special
items
of
good
advice
thank
you
sighed
cynthia
i
wo
forget
of
course
we
never
did
such
a
thing
at
the
poplars
but
if
it
expected
i
wo
break
the
traditions
of
the
school
you
can
always
depend
upon
me
in
that
respect
precisely
at
the
whole
of
the
school
was
assembled
in
the
big
hall
awaiting
the
presence
of
their
lecturer
professor
marshall
who
had
been
regaling
himself
with
lunch
in
miss
beasley
study
now
made
his
appearance
escorted
by
the
head
mistress
and
apparently
refreshed
by
cocoa
and
conversation
the
girls
always
agreed
that
his
manners
were
beautiful
he
treated
everybody
with
a
courtly
deference
something
between
the
professional
consideration
of
a
fashionable
doctor
and
the
dignity
of
an
archdeacon
after
miss
uncompromising
attitude
the
contrast
was
marked
he
entered
the
room
smiling
bowed
a
courteous
good
morning
to
his
pupils
who
rose
to
receive
him
and
placed
a
chair
for
miss
beasley
with
gentlemanly
attention
the
principal
radiant
after
showing
off
her
new
quarters
refused
it
with
equal
politeness
no
thank
you
professor
i
not
going
to
stay
i
have
other
work
to
do
you
will
find
your
class
the
same
as
before
with
the
addition
of
two
new
girls
maude
heywood
come
here
maudie
and
cynthia
greene
i
hope
they
both
prove
good
workers
maudie
heywood
blushing
like
a
lobster
stepped
forward
and
thrust
three
limp
fingers
for
a
fraction
of
a
second
into
the
large
clasp
then
thankfully
merged
her
identity
among
her
schoolfellows
cynthia
who
was
behind
her
smiled
bewitchingly
upwards
into
the
florid
benevolent
face
of
her
new
instructor
then
falling
gracefully
upon
one
knee
seized
his
hand
and
touched
it
with
her
lips
the
sensation
in
the
room
was
immense
the
professor
looking
decidedly
astonished
and
embarrassed
hastily
withdrew
his
hand
from
the
affectionate
salutation
miss
beasley
eyes
were
round
with
horror
cynthia
she
exclaimed
and
the
tone
of
her
voice
alone
was
sufficient
reproof
the
luckless
cynthia
instantly
conscious
that
her
act
had
been
misconstrued
retired
with
less
grace
than
she
had
come
forward
and
spent
most
of
the
lecture
in
surreptitiously
mopping
her
eyes
as
she
walked
dejectedly
down
the
corridor
afterwards
she
was
accosted
by
hermione
graveson
a
member
of
the
sixth
look
here
said
hermione
briefly
what
prompted
you
to
make
such
an
utter
exhibition
of
yourself
just
now
i
never
saw
anything
more
sickening
in
my
life
cynthia
tears
burst
forth
afresh
it
was
my
fault
she
sobbed
i
did
want
to
do
it
but
i
was
told
it
was
school
etiquette
and
i
must
who
told
you
such
rubbish
that
girl
with
the
dark
eyes
and
a
patriotic
hair
ribbon
raymonde
armitage
i
believe
that
her
name
hermie
shook
her
head
solemnly
new
girls
are
notoriously
callow
she
remarked
but
i
should
have
thought
anybody
with
the
slightest
grain
of
sense
could
have
seen
at
a
glance
what
raymonde
is
why
she
simply
been
playing
ragtime
on
you
did
you
actually
and
seriously
believe
that
the
girls
at
this
school
were
expected
to
go
through
such
idiotic
performances
believe
a
word
raymonde
tells
you
again
whom
shall
i
believe
everybody
tries
to
stuff
me
wailed
the
injured
cynthia
i
never
treated
anybody
like
this
at
the
poplars
trust
your
common
sense
that
is
if
you
happen
to
have
any
and
for
goodness
sake
do
snivel
any
more
wipe
your
eyes
and
take
it
sporting
and
wait
a
moment
if
you
want
a
bit
of
really
good
sound
advice
do
mention
the
poplars
again
or
the
fact
that
you
were
head
girl
there
and
the
idol
of
the
school
and
the
rest
of
it
you
only
a
junior
here
and
the
sooner
you
find
your
level
the
better
we
not
exactly
aching
to
have
our
tone
improved
by
you
and
look
here
take
that
absurd
keepsake
bracelet
off
and
lock
it
up
in
your
box
and
do
let
anybody
see
it
again
till
the
end
of
the
term
there
go
and
digest
what
i
told
you
having
settled
with
cynthia
greene
it
now
remained
for
the
mystic
seven
to
turn
their
attention
to
the
matter
of
maudie
heywood
the
situation
was
growing
acute
maudie
had
been
ten
days
at
the
grange
and
in
that
brief
space
of
time
she
was
already
beginning
to
establish
a
precedent
she
was
a
tall
slim
girl
with
earnest
eyes
a
decided
chin
and
an
intellectual
forehead
work
with
a
capital
w
was
her
fetish
she
sat
during
classes
with
her
gaze
focused
on
her
teacher
and
a
look
of
intelligent
interest
that
surpassed
everyone
else
in
the
form
miss
gibbs
turned
instinctively
to
maudie
at
the
most
important
points
of
the
lesson
there
was
a
feeling
abroad
that
she
sucked
in
knowledge
like
a
sponge
nobody
would
have
objected
to
her
consuming
as
much
as
she
liked
of
the
mental
provender
supplied
had
she
stopped
at
that
maudie
unfortunately
was
and
finding
the
amount
of
preparation
set
her
to
be
well
below
the
limit
of
her
capacity
invariably
did
a
little
more
than
was
required
her
maps
were
coloured
her
botany
papers
illustrated
with
neat
drawings
her
history
exercises
had
genealogical
tables
appended
and
her
literature
essays
were
full
of
quotations
this
was
all
very
exemplary
and
won
golden
opinions
from
miss
gibbs
but
it
caused
heartburnings
in
the
form
it
was
felt
that
maudie
was
unduly
raising
the
standard
miss
gibbs
had
suggested
that
other
botany
papers
might
contain
diagrams
and
had
placed
upon
the
a
book
of
poetical
extracts
suitable
for
use
in
if
we
do
take
care
we
be
having
our
prep
doubled
said
aveline
uneasily
it
was
decided
to
reason
with
maudie
before
taking
any
more
active
measures
the
united
seven
tackled
her
upon
the
subject
i
promised
mother
i
work
urged
maudie
in
reply
to
their
remonstrances
but
you
no
need
to
work
overtime
objected
ardiune
we
mind
how
hard
you
swat
during
but
it
is
right
for
you
to
be
putting
in
extra
while
the
rest
of
us
are
in
the
garden
it
stealing
an
advantage
it
a
work
of
supererogation
added
katherine
maudie
wrinkled
up
her
intellectual
forehead
anxiously
works
of
supererogation
are
supposed
to
count
she
interposed
in
her
precise
measured
voice
yes
if
they
done
with
intention
for
somebody
else
flared
raymonde
but
yours
are
they
entirely
for
your
own
pride
and
vanity
do
you
come
and
translate
my
latin
for
me
in
those
extra
not
a
bit
of
it
oh
that
would
be
fair
maudie
tone
was
of
shocked
virtue
it
more
unfair
to
heap
burdens
on
the
rest
of
your
form
i
bound
to
do
my
best
the
fact
is
burst
out
aveline
you
suffering
from
an
conscience
you
got
an
abnormal
appetite
for
work
and
it
ought
to
be
checked
it
is
good
for
you
promise
us
you
wo
write
or
learn
a
word
out
of
prep
time
maudie
shook
her
head
sadly
her
grey
eyes
gleamed
with
the
enthusiasm
of
the
martyr
spirit
i
ca
promise
anything
she
sighed
something
within
me
urges
me
to
work
then
something
without
you
will
have
to
put
a
stop
to
it
snapped
raymonde
we
given
you
full
and
fair
warning
so
now
you
may
look
out
for
squalls
when
preparation
was
over
the
girls
were
allowed
to
amuse
themselves
as
they
liked
until
supper
most
of
them
adjourned
to
the
garden
for
the
evenings
were
getting
longer
and
lighter
every
day
and
the
tennis
courts
were
in
quite
fair
condition
it
was
maudie
habit
to
take
a
pensive
stroll
among
the
flower
beds
in
the
courtyard
and
then
repair
to
the
again
to
touch
up
her
exercises
on
this
particular
evening
raymonde
with
a
contingent
of
the
mystic
seven
lingered
behind
we
just
about
ten
minutes
she
announced
old
maudie
as
punctual
as
a
clock
she
walk
five
times
round
the
sundial
and
twice
to
the
gate
that
girl
destined
for
the
cloister
said
aveline
pityingly
she
evidently
thirsting
to
live
her
life
by
rule
mark
my
words
she
eventually
take
the
veil
no
she
pass
triumphantly
through
college
and
come
out
equal
to
a
or
senior
wrangler
or
something
swanky
of
that
kind
and
get
made
head
mistress
of
a
high
school
prognosticated
ardiune
in
the
meantime
she
wo
swat
any
more
grinned
raymonde
wait
for
me
here
girls
i
got
to
fetch
something
raymonde
performed
her
errand
with
lightning
speed
she
returned
with
a
lump
of
soft
substance
in
one
hand
and
a
and
in
the
other
her
chums
looked
mystified
cobblers
wax
she
explained
airily
brought
some
with
me
in
case
of
emergency
it
useful
stuff
and
i
just
looted
linda
curling
apparatus
from
her
bedroom
do
you
twig
what
blind
bats
you
are
i
going
to
stick
up
maudie
desk
raymonde
lighted
the
and
heated
the
tongs
then
spreading
a
thick
coating
of
the
wax
along
the
inside
edge
of
the
desk
she
applied
the
hot
iron
to
melt
it
and
put
down
the
lid
it
will
have
hardened
by
the
time
maudie
has
finished
her
constitutional
among
the
flower
beds
she
giggled
i
guarantee
when
she
comes
back
she
wo
be
able
to
open
her
desk
it
only
right
for
her
to
feel
the
pressure
of
public
opinion
decreed
ardiune
we
working
in
a
good
cause
but
we
modest
about
it
and
do
want
to
push
ourselves
forward
urged
raymonde
i
vote
we
go
for
a
stroll
down
to
the
very
bottom
of
the
orchard
near
the
moat
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
miss
beasley
and
miss
gibbs
were
sitting
together
in
the
principal
study
enjoying
a
period
of
repose
and
a
chat
their
conversation
turned
upon
the
varied
dispositions
of
their
pupils
maudie
heywood
strikes
me
as
a
very
earnest
character
observed
miss
beasley
toying
with
the
violets
in
her
belt
her
work
is
really
excellent
almost
too
good
agreed
miss
gibbs
who
was
perhaps
beginning
to
find
out
that
maudie
exercises
took
twice
as
long
to
correct
as
anybody
else
and
thus
sensibly
curtailed
her
teacher
leisure
the
child
is
so
conscientious
in
my
opinion
she
needs
to
concentrate
more
on
physical
exercise
i
should
like
to
see
her
in
the
tennis
courts
instead
of
copying
out
reams
of
poetry
yes
said
miss
beasley
looking
thoughtful
her
activities
perhaps
need
a
little
adjustment
we
must
allow
her
to
neglect
her
health
she
looks
sometimes
for
a
girl
of
fifteen
she
is
always
such
a
calm
child
remarked
miss
gibbs
appreciatively
at
that
moment
there
was
a
hurried
the
door
opened
and
maudie
burst
in
unannounced
her
calm
had
yielded
to
an
agitated
condition
of
excitement
and
indignation
her
earnest
eyes
were
flashing
angry
sparks
and
her
cheeks
were
crimson
oh
miss
beasley
she
began
those
girls
have
actually
gone
and
stuck
up
my
desk
so
that
i
ca
get
out
my
books
they
say
i
work
overtime
and
it
not
fair
for
if
i
like
to
work
why
should
i
i
just
detest
the
whole
lot
of
them
i
hate
this
place
i
think
you
forgetting
yourself
maudie
returned
the
principal
it
is
hardly
good
manners
to
enter
my
study
so
abruptly
and
to
speak
in
this
way
to
me
if
you
wish
to
please
me
i
should
much
prefer
you
to
spend
your
leisure
time
at
games
instead
of
lessons
evening
i
hope
to
see
you
playing
tennis
if
you
ask
the
cook
for
a
you
probably
be
able
to
wedge
open
your
desk
easily
but
in
future
you
be
wiser
to
confine
your
work
to
the
preparation
hours
the
bow
must
be
unstrung
sometimes
or
your
health
will
suffer
if
you
join
with
the
other
girls
at
their
games
you
soon
get
to
know
them
and
feel
more
at
home
here
try
to
be
sociable
and
make
yourself
liked
part
of
the
training
of
school
life
is
to
learn
to
accommodate
yourself
to
a
community
the
crestfallen
maudie
retired
murmuring
apologies
miss
beasley
picked
up
her
copy
of
and
laughed
as
a
rule
we
may
trust
the
girls
themselves
to
do
any
necessary
pruning
they
the
strictest
socialists
that
could
be
imagined
they
instinctively
have
all
the
principles
of
a
trade
union
about
them
on
the
whole
it
good
for
maudie
to
be
restrained
a
little
innocent
practical
joke
will
do
her
no
harm
for
once
she
must
be
able
to
take
her
share
of
teasing
humour
is
her
one
deficiency
i
think
i
can
guess
who
at
the
bottom
of
the
business
sniffed
miss
gibbs
raymonde
armitage
is
the
naughtiest
girl
in
the
school
pardon
me
corrected
miss
beasley
the
most
mischievous
perhaps
and
the
most
troublesome
full
of
bubbling
spirits
and
misplaced
energy
but
straightforward
and
truthful
there
is
something
very
lovable
about
raymonde
chapter
iii
the
limberlost
everybody
agreed
that
marlowe
grange
was
an
ideal
spot
for
a
school
the
picturesque
old
orchard
and
grounds
provided
an
almost
unlimited
field
of
amusement
those
girls
who
were
interested
in
horticulture
might
have
their
own
little
plots
at
the
end
of
the
potato
patch
and
a
delightful
series
of
experiments
had
been
started
down
by
the
moat
where
a
real
genuine
was
in
process
of
construction
here
duly
shod
in
rubber
waders
a
few
enthusiasts
toiled
almost
daily
planting
iris
and
and
flowering
rush
and
sinking
roots
in
old
wicker
baskets
weighted
with
stones
there
was
even
a
scheme
on
hand
to
subscribe
to
buy
a
punt
but
miss
beasley
had
frowned
upon
the
idea
as
containing
too
great
an
element
of
danger
and
of
consequent
anxiety
for
teachers
i
do
want
a
set
of
ophelias
drowning
themselves
among
the
willows
and
the
long
purples
she
remarked
firmly
if
we
bought
a
punt
we
should
need
a
drag
and
a
as
well
you
shall
go
for
a
row
on
the
river
sometimes
during
the
summer
and
that
must
content
you
there
are
plenty
of
occupations
on
dry
land
to
amuse
yourselves
with
the
grange
certainly
contained
ample
space
for
interests
of
every
description
the
old
farm
buildings
made
sheds
for
carpentry
and
or
any
other
work
that
was
too
messy
for
the
schoolrooms
under
the
direction
of
miss
gibbs
some
of
the
elder
girls
were
turning
the
contents
of
a
wood
pile
into
a
set
of
rustic
garden
seats
and
other
industrious
spirits
had
begun
to
plait
osierwithes
into
baskets
that
were
destined
for
blackberry
picking
in
the
autumn
the
house
itself
was
roomy
enough
to
allow
hobbies
to
overflow
miss
beasley
who
dabbled
rather
successfully
in
photography
had
a
conveniently
equipped
which
she
lent
by
special
favour
to
seniors
only
on
the
understanding
that
they
left
it
as
they
found
it
miss
gibbs
had
taken
possession
of
an
empty
attic
and
had
made
it
into
a
scientific
sanctum
so
far
none
of
the
girls
had
been
allowed
to
peep
inside
and
the
wildest
rumours
were
afloat
as
to
what
the
room
contained
batteries
and
other
apparatus
had
been
seen
to
be
carried
upstairs
and
those
scouts
who
had
ventured
along
the
forbidden
upper
landing
reported
that
through
the
closed
door
they
could
hear
weird
noises
as
of
turning
wheels
or
bubbling
crucibles
it
was
surmised
in
the
school
that
miss
gibbs
having
found
a
congenial
medi√¶val
atmosphere
for
her
researches
was
working
on
the
lines
of
the
ancient
alchemists
and
attempting
to
discover
the
elixir
of
life
or
the
philosopher
stone
one
fact
was
certain
miss
gibbs
had
set
up
a
telescope
in
her
solitary
attic
she
had
bought
it
during
the
holidays
from
the
widow
of
a
coastguardsman
and
with
its
aid
she
studied
the
landscape
by
day
and
the
stars
by
night
the
girls
considered
she
kept
a
wary
eye
on
watch
for
escaped
germans
or
zeppelins
and
regarded
the
instrument
in
the
light
of
a
safeguard
for
the
establishment
besides
which
anything
a
blessing
that
takes
gibbie
upstairs
and
keeps
her
from
buzzing
round
us
all
the
time
averred
raymonde
she
welcome
to
keep
anything
she
likes
in
her
room
from
a
stuffed
crocodile
to
a
snake
in
a
bottle
yawned
fauvette
all
i
ask
is
that
she
does
take
me
up
and
improve
my
mind
i
getting
fed
up
with
hobbies
i
ca
show
an
intelligent
interest
in
all
my
poor
little
brains
wo
hold
them
what
with
repouss√©
work
and
stencilling
and
chip
carving
i
hardly
ever
get
half
an
hour
to
enjoy
a
book
my
idea
of
a
jinky
time
is
to
sit
by
the
moat
and
read
and
eat
chocolates
by
the
by
has
that
copy
of
come
yet
hermie
promised
to
get
it
for
the
library
the
girls
at
the
grange
had
fashions
in
books
and
at
present
they
were
all
raving
over
the
works
of
gene
stratton
porter
even
raymonde
not
generally
much
of
a
reader
had
succumbed
to
the
charms
of
and
girl
of
the
the
accounts
of
the
american
swamp
forest
fascinated
her
it
was
a
veritable
call
of
the
wild
i
give
anything
just
anything
to
get
into
such
a
place
she
confided
to
fauvette
i
chance
even
the
snakes
and
mosquitoes
just
think
of
the
trees
and
the
flowers
and
the
birds
and
the
butterflies
why
do
we
have
things
like
that
in
england
i
expect
we
do
only
one
never
gets
to
see
them
there
a
wood
over
there
on
the
hill
that
looks
absolutely
if
one
could
go
into
it
hermie
said
the
other
day
that
the
bumble
bee
had
buzzed
out
something
about
taking
us
all
for
a
picnic
there
some
day
it
would
be
rather
precious
raymonde
shook
her
head
reflectively
picnics
are
all
very
well
in
their
way
but
when
you
turn
about
thirty
people
together
into
a
wood
i
fancy
the
birds
and
butterflies
will
give
us
a
wide
berth
freckles
found
his
specimens
when
he
was
alone
you
ca
go
naturalizing
in
a
crowd
look
here
suppose
you
and
i
go
and
explore
i
be
the
bird
woman
and
you
can
be
the
swamp
angel
oh
what
a
blossomy
idea
but
what
about
gibbie
can
we
dodge
her
we
wait
till
she
shut
herself
up
in
her
attic
and
then
scoot
between
tea
and
prep
the
best
time
especially
now
prep
been
put
later
you
really
have
the
most
chubby
inspirations
ray
burbled
fauvette
you
an
absolute
mascot
the
idea
of
posing
as
the
swamp
angel
appealed
to
fauvette
she
was
conscious
that
she
looked
the
part
she
fingered
her
fluffy
flaxen
curls
caressingly
and
resolved
to
wear
a
blue
cotton
dress
for
the
next
day
or
two
in
case
there
was
a
chance
of
the
expedition
in
imagination
she
was
already
photographing
rare
birds
and
shooting
villains
with
revolvers
and
looking
her
best
through
it
all
i
wish
i
knew
how
to
mix
iced
drinks
she
sighed
regretfully
one
ca
get
even
the
ice
over
here
not
to
speak
of
the
bits
of
cherry
and
lemon
and
grape
and
pineapple
that
the
angel
used
for
freckles
girls
in
america
have
a
far
better
time
than
we
have
cheero
we
get
a
little
fun
you
see
if
we
can
only
circumvent
the
wasp
it
was
not
a
remarkably
easy
matter
to
leave
the
premises
unobserved
monitresses
had
a
tiresome
habit
of
hanging
about
in
places
where
they
were
not
wanted
mademoiselle
made
herself
far
too
conspicuous
and
miss
gibbs
seemed
everywhere
the
chums
decided
that
a
too
great
attention
to
duty
can
degenerate
into
a
fault
it
what
miss
beasley
said
in
the
scripture
lesson
declared
raymonde
economy
turns
into
parsimony
liberality
into
extravagance
into
pride
gibbie
the
mark
and
letting
responsibility
run
to
fussiness
it
is
hardly
possible
to
tackle
a
mistress
and
convince
her
of
her
faults
so
miss
gibbs
pharisaical
tendencies
went
unchecked
evidently
the
only
possible
method
was
to
dodge
her
whether
her
suspicions
were
aroused
it
is
impossible
to
say
but
for
several
days
she
neglected
her
attic
sanctum
and
pervaded
the
garden
during
recreation
hours
raymonde
and
fauvette
lay
low
and
toiled
with
an
amazing
spurt
of
industry
at
you
each
nearly
finished
a
basket
said
miss
gibbs
approvingly
yes
if
we
go
on
working
hard
this
afternoon
i
think
we
shall
finish
them
replied
raymonde
craftily
it
nice
to
have
a
thing
done
i
glad
you
taken
to
such
a
sensible
employment
commented
miss
gibbs
we
like
to
have
our
fingers
occupied
and
then
our
minds
have
time
to
wander
said
raymonde
quoting
so
shamelessly
from
miss
beasley
that
fauvette
kicked
her
surreptitiously
in
alarm
miss
gibbs
regarded
her
for
a
moment
with
suspicion
but
her
eyes
were
bent
demurely
over
her
basket
and
her
expression
was
innocence
personified
it
as
well
you
have
something
to
do
under
cover
for
i
think
going
to
rain
observed
the
mistress
as
she
turned
to
leave
the
barn
the
girls
watched
her
cross
the
courtyard
and
enter
the
house
then
fauvette
scooting
in
by
the
back
way
had
the
further
satisfaction
of
seeing
the
tail
of
her
skirt
whisking
up
the
attic
stairs
she
ran
back
to
report
to
raymonde
gibbie
safe
in
her
sanctum
she
thinks
we
happily
employed
here
for
the
next
hour
let
bolt
for
the
limberlost
there
nobody
in
the
courtyard
echoed
raymonde
it
the
opportunity
of
a
lifetime
they
did
not
wait
to
fetch
hats
but
strolling
down
the
flagged
path
as
if
for
exercise
reached
the
great
gate
then
glancing
cautiously
round
to
see
that
the
coast
was
absolutely
clear
they
unlatched
the
little
postern
door
slipped
through
and
shut
it
after
them
a
moment
later
they
were
running
at
top
speed
down
the
road
that
led
to
the
wood
it
was
not
a
very
great
distance
away
and
they
had
often
passed
near
it
in
their
walks
to
scramble
over
the
palings
and
enter
its
cool
mysterious
shade
had
been
their
dream
they
were
resolved
now
to
make
it
a
reality
they
had
been
prepared
for
something
delightful
but
not
for
the
little
terrestrial
paradise
that
spread
itself
at
the
farther
side
of
the
fence
the
wood
had
been
thinned
comparatively
recently
so
that
it
admitted
an
unusual
amount
of
light
and
air
the
trees
just
bursting
into
the
tender
green
of
early
may
spread
delicate
lacy
boughs
overhead
like
tender
fingers
held
out
to
guard
the
treasures
underneath
the
ground
below
still
moist
and
boggy
from
the
spring
rains
was
clothed
with
a
carpet
of
dog
violets
growing
in
such
profusion
that
they
seemed
to
stretch
in
a
vista
of
palest
mauve
into
the
distance
at
close
intervals
among
these
grew
glorious
clumps
of
golden
cowslips
and
purple
meadow
orchis
taller
and
finer
by
far
than
those
in
the
meadows
and
deliciously
fragrant
in
the
swampy
hollows
were
yellow
marsh
marigolds
and
blue
on
the
drier
soil
of
the
rising
bank
the
wild
hyacinths
were
just
shaking
open
their
bells
and
heartsease
here
and
there
lifted
coy
heads
to
the
sunlight
raymonde
and
fauvette
wandered
about
in
ecstasy
picking
great
bunches
of
the
flowers
and
running
from
clump
to
clump
with
thrills
of
delight
surely
even
freckles
limberlost
could
not
be
more
beautiful
than
this
a
persistent
cuckoo
was
calling
in
the
meadow
close
by
a
thrush
with
his
brown
throat
all
trilled
in
a
birch
tree
overhead
and
a
blackbird
warbled
his
heart
out
among
the
hazel
bushes
by
the
fence
the
girls
went
peeping
here
and
there
and
everywhere
in
quest
of
birds
nests
and
their
diligent
search
was
amply
rewarded
in
the
hollow
of
a
decaying
stump
a
robin
was
feeding
five
little
gaping
mouths
the
blackbird
mate
guarded
four
speckled
eggs
and
three
separate
thrushes
had
treasures
in
cradles
amidst
the
undergrowth
as
they
penetrated
farther
into
the
wood
they
struck
upon
a
pond
closely
surrounded
by
sallows
and
alders
raymonde
peered
through
the
shimmering
leaves
and
called
fauvette
with
a
cry
of
joy
for
covering
almost
the
entire
surface
of
the
water
was
a
mass
of
the
gorgeous
fringed
blossoms
of
the
bog
bean
the
girls
had
never
found
it
before
and
it
was
indeed
rare
for
it
to
be
growing
in
a
midland
county
they
thought
it
was
the
most
beautiful
flower
they
had
ever
seen
how
to
pick
any
was
the
difficulty
for
even
the
nearest
piece
lay
fully
a
yard
from
the
edge
of
the
pond
and
the
finest
blooms
were
in
the
middle
of
the
water
i
going
to
get
some
somehow
if
i
have
to
take
off
my
shoes
and
stockings
declared
raymonde
an
easier
way
than
wading
however
presented
itself
close
by
the
side
of
the
pond
was
a
young
tree
which
had
been
blown
over
by
the
spring
gales
the
forester
had
chopped
it
from
its
roots
but
had
not
yet
removed
it
by
dint
of
much
energy
the
girls
lifted
this
and
pushed
it
over
the
water
till
part
of
it
rested
securely
on
an
alder
which
grew
on
a
little
island
in
the
midst
it
made
a
rather
shaky
but
perfectly
possible
bridge
if
not
for
fauvette
at
least
for
raymonde
the
latter
advanced
upon
it
cautiously
but
courageously
she
took
three
steps
almost
slipped
but
regained
her
balance
by
a
miracle
grasped
an
overhanging
bough
of
the
alder
and
set
a
firm
foot
on
the
island
from
here
by
reaching
a
long
arm
she
could
gather
some
fine
specimens
of
the
bog
bean
she
pulled
it
up
in
handfuls
with
trailing
oozy
stalks
as
she
turned
to
grip
the
alder
branch
before
venturing
back
over
her
primitive
bridge
her
eye
suddenly
caught
sight
of
a
large
nest
built
at
the
extreme
brink
of
the
water
it
held
four
eggs
and
an
agitated
moorhen
seeking
cover
among
the
reeds
gave
the
clue
to
their
parentage
the
school
was
making
a
collection
of
birds
eggs
for
its
museum
there
were
plenty
of
robins
and
thrushes
and
blackbirds
and
all
the
common
varieties
but
so
far
not
a
solitary
specimen
of
a
moorhen
egg
raymonde
felt
that
even
at
the
risk
of
betraying
their
secret
expedition
she
must
secure
some
of
these
she
decided
to
go
halves
to
take
two
and
leave
two
in
the
nest
to
console
the
moorhen
when
she
came
back
she
wrapped
them
in
some
grass
and
packed
them
in
her
handkerchief
which
she
slung
round
her
neck
for
safety
then
taking
her
bunch
of
bog
bean
she
managed
to
scramble
back
to
the
bank
the
girls
were
naturalists
enough
to
remove
their
from
the
island
lest
it
should
tempt
marauding
boys
to
go
across
and
discover
the
moorhen
nest
they
hoped
the
bird
would
return
and
sit
again
when
they
were
out
of
the
way
each
carefully
carrying
one
of
the
precious
eggs
they
went
on
farther
to
explore
the
wood
they
had
only
walked
a
short
distance
when
fauvette
stopped
suddenly
what
that
queer
squeaking
noise
she
asked
do
you
hear
it
too
confirmed
raymonde
the
girls
glanced
round
and
then
looked
at
each
other
blankly
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
persistent
chirruping
and
peeping
came
from
the
eggs
in
their
hands
oh
good
night
the
wretched
things
are
hatching
out
gasped
raymonde
they
had
indeed
robbed
the
poor
moorhen
at
the
very
moment
when
her
chicks
were
in
the
process
of
hatching
already
there
was
a
chip
in
the
side
of
each
egg
and
a
tiny
bill
began
to
protrude
the
owner
of
which
was
raising
a
shrill
clamour
of
welcome
to
the
world
the
girls
laid
them
hastily
down
on
the
grass
those
wo
be
any
use
for
the
museum
exploded
fauvette
i
wonder
if
we
ought
to
put
them
back
murmured
raymonde
decidedly
though
somewhat
unwilling
to
venture
again
over
the
slippery
she
might
perhaps
have
braved
the
crossing
and
restored
the
eggs
to
the
nest
but
at
that
moment
the
rain
which
had
been
threatening
all
the
afternoon
came
down
in
a
torrent
she
felt
it
had
sealed
the
fate
of
the
chicks
we
just
have
to
leave
them
here
it
like
murder
but
i
help
it
if
we
do
get
back
quick
we
shall
be
drenched
as
the
girls
turned
to
retrace
their
steps
they
became
aware
that
they
were
not
alone
in
the
wood
some
distance
among
the
bushes
a
dark
coat
and
hat
were
plainly
advancing
in
their
direction
undoubtedly
somebody
had
been
watching
them
and
was
following
them
wild
visions
of
black
jack
and
his
limberlost
gang
swam
before
their
eyes
and
with
one
accord
they
ran
ran
anywhere
bent
only
on
escaping
a
voice
shouted
and
it
added
to
their
terror
and
sent
them
hurrying
on
the
faster
they
imagined
oaths
and
behind
them
such
exciting
scenes
were
all
very
well
in
the
pages
of
but
they
would
be
decidedly
out
of
place
in
an
english
wood
when
it
came
to
the
point
neither
of
them
possessed
the
courage
and
presence
of
mind
of
the
swamp
angel
suppose
they
found
themselves
bound
and
gagged
and
tied
to
trees
while
some
dastardly
ruffians
hewed
down
the
best
timber
in
the
wood
the
shouts
behind
grew
nearer
their
pursuer
was
evidently
gaining
upon
them
through
the
pouring
rain
they
struggled
on
splashing
anyhow
through
swampy
places
regardless
of
soaked
shoes
and
stockings
pushing
through
wet
bushes
and
underneath
dripping
branches
possessed
by
the
one
idea
of
flight
down
through
the
hollow
where
they
had
gathered
the
and
up
the
bluebell
bank
they
struggled
with
never
a
thought
for
the
flowers
and
they
were
just
about
to
scramble
over
some
felled
trees
when
raymonde
who
was
a
yard
in
advance
caught
her
foot
in
a
tangle
of
brier
and
fell
on
her
hands
and
knees
among
the
springing
bracken
fauvette
unable
to
stop
herself
collided
heavily
and
collapsed
by
her
side
too
much
out
of
breath
to
stir
the
girls
lay
for
a
few
moments
panting
hallo
wait
shouted
their
pursuer
the
rather
rasping
authoritative
voice
was
so
well
known
and
familiar
that
the
girls
scrambled
up
and
turned
round
to
find
no
desperate
villain
armed
with
revolver
and
but
miss
gibbs
in
a
neat
mackintosh
and
rainproof
hat
to
match
she
advanced
breathless
and
agitated
and
very
decidedly
out
of
temper
you
naughty
girls
what
do
you
mean
by
running
away
like
this
i
watched
you
through
my
telescope
as
you
went
to
the
wood
and
of
course
followed
you
why
did
you
come
at
once
when
i
called
we
did
know
it
was
you
murmured
raymonde
forbearing
to
explain
that
they
had
taken
their
mistress
for
a
ruffian
fauvette
said
nothing
she
was
looking
horribly
conscious
and
caught
miss
gibbs
glared
at
the
guilty
pair
and
telling
them
curtly
to
come
along
led
the
way
back
such
a
serious
breach
of
school
discipline
was
naturally
visited
with
heavy
consequences
for
the
next
three
days
raymonde
and
fauvette
spent
their
recreation
hours
indoors
copying
certain
classic
lines
of
they
were
debarred
from
the
purchase
of
chocolates
or
any
other
form
of
sweetstuff
for
the
period
of
a
month
and
made
to
understand
that
they
were
under
the
ban
not
only
of
miss
gibbs
but
also
of
miss
beasley
displeasure
i
never
thought
of
that
wretched
telescope
mourned
fauvette
just
imagine
gibbie
spying
on
us
all
the
time
she
must
have
watched
us
scramble
over
the
palings
into
the
wood
it
worse
than
second
sight
and
then
for
her
to
come
gallivanting
out
after
us
in
that
swanky
mackintosh
it
gave
me
spasms
we
a
jinky
time
though
first
it
was
worth
being
caught
afterwards
maintained
raymonde
candidly
and
you
know
in
secret
the
bumble
bee
was
rejoiced
to
see
that
bog
bean
she
wo
admit
it
of
course
but
i
know
it
the
discovery
of
the
term
it
recorded
in
the
nature
and
the
best
piece
was
pressed
for
the
museum
my
own
private
opinion
is
that
both
the
bumble
and
the
wasp
will
go
buzzing
off
to
that
limberlost
exploring
on
their
own
some
day
and
i
do
blame
them
it
a
paradise
most
place
i
ever
been
in
in
my
life
agreed
fauvette
sighing
heavily
i
say
i
call
it
rather
appropriate
of
the
bumble
to
have
made
us
copy
out
chapter
iv
raymonde
explores
there
was
no
doubt
that
marlowe
grange
was
one
of
the
quaintest
old
houses
in
the
county
the
girls
all
felt
that
its
medi√¶val
atmosphere
was
unrivalled
even
such
prosaic
subjects
as
geometry
or
analysis
took
on
an
element
of
romance
when
studied
in
an
chamber
with
coats
of
arms
emblazoned
on
the
upper
panes
of
the
windows
it
was
the
fashion
in
the
school
to
rejoice
in
the
antique
surroundings
the
girls
took
numerous
photos
and
printed
picture
to
send
home
to
their
families
and
friends
and
everyone
with
the
least
aptitude
for
drawing
started
a
sketchbook
like
most
ancient
buildings
the
old
hall
while
preserving
its
principal
rooms
in
good
repair
was
growing
shaky
in
the
upper
stories
the
labyrinth
of
attics
that
lay
under
the
roof
had
been
neglected
till
the
latticed
windows
were
almost
off
their
hinges
and
the
plaster
had
fallen
in
great
patches
from
the
ceilings
fearing
lest
the
floors
were
really
unsafe
miss
beasley
had
made
the
top
story
a
forbidden
territory
and
to
ensure
her
orders
being
obeyed
had
placed
a
wire
door
to
shut
it
off
from
the
rest
of
the
house
this
door
was
kept
locked
miss
beasley
and
miss
gibbs
each
having
a
key
every
day
girls
pressed
inquisitive
noses
against
the
wire
netting
to
peep
at
the
tantalizing
prospect
beyond
they
could
just
see
round
the
corner
of
a
winding
oak
staircase
on
to
a
dim
mysterious
landing
beyond
once
or
twice
miss
gibbs
had
gone
to
her
attic
laboratory
and
had
left
the
door
open
behind
her
and
a
few
bold
spirits
had
ventured
upstairs
but
as
the
door
of
her
room
had
also
been
wide
open
they
had
not
dared
to
pass
it
and
risk
discovery
and
had
been
obliged
to
beat
a
hasty
retreat
it
was
highly
aggravating
for
the
vista
of
dark
passages
looked
most
alluring
could
we
ask
the
bumble
to
take
us
round
the
attics
some
saturday
for
a
special
treat
suggested
ardiune
be
much
fun
going
in
a
specially
conducted
party
like
a
crowd
of
tourists
sniffed
raymonde
we
all
have
to
stand
at
attention
while
the
bumble
gave
a
short
lecture
on
the
architecture
or
the
historical
significance
of
some
thingumbobs
it
would
just
turn
it
all
into
a
lesson
what
i
want
is
to
go
and
poke
about
on
my
own
and
i
mean
to
some
day
gibbie
snap
your
head
off
if
she
caught
you
i
do
intend
to
be
caught
it
was
all
very
well
to
lay
plans
but
another
matter
to
carry
them
out
miss
gibbs
usually
locked
the
wire
door
behind
her
only
leaving
it
open
when
she
went
upstairs
to
fetch
something
and
meant
to
return
almost
immediately
the
mere
fact
of
its
difficulty
increased
raymonde
zest
for
the
adventure
her
wild
spirits
welcomed
the
element
of
possible
danger
and
the
imminence
of
discovery
added
an
extra
spice
for
days
she
haunted
the
vicinity
of
the
winding
staircase
hiding
in
bedrooms
and
watching
in
case
miss
gibbs
went
to
her
laboratory
twice
she
watched
the
mistress
pass
through
the
wire
door
and
lock
it
safely
behind
her
quite
unaware
of
the
outraged
pupil
fuming
in
no
dormitory
opposite
raymonde
reiterated
her
old
opinion
that
miss
gibbs
was
far
too
exact
and
conscientious
on
one
eventful
afternoon
however
fortune
favoured
her
no
less
a
person
than
miss
beasley
ascended
the
interesting
staircase
actually
leaving
the
defences
unsecured
raymonde
seized
the
opportunity
and
like
a
little
ghost
or
shadow
stole
softly
after
her
the
head
mistress
had
entered
the
laboratory
and
had
closed
that
door
after
her
raymonde
tiptoed
up
to
it
and
could
hear
voices
inside
the
whirling
of
a
wheel
and
a
kind
of
bubbling
sound
was
miss
beasley
assisting
miss
gibbs
with
the
alchemy
she
did
not
wait
even
to
take
a
survey
through
the
keyhole
but
hurrying
on
turned
the
corner
of
the
passage
she
found
herself
in
another
long
narrow
landing
with
rooms
on
both
sides
she
peeped
into
most
of
these
they
were
empty
and
in
a
deplorable
state
of
disrepair
plaster
had
fallen
from
the
ceilings
showing
the
rafters
in
some
places
even
streaks
of
daylight
shone
through
chinks
in
the
tiled
roof
the
old
floors
had
rotted
into
holes
and
raymonde
had
to
walk
warily
to
avoid
putting
her
foot
through
in
tender
places
many
of
the
rooms
had
cupboards
dark
mysterious
cobwebby
recesses
into
which
she
peered
with
a
rather
jumpy
sensation
that
a
bogy
might
suddenly
pop
out
the
whole
atmosphere
of
the
place
was
ghostly
even
in
the
daytime
i
should
like
to
come
up
here
at
night
shivered
raymonde
as
far
as
she
could
tell
the
passage
seemed
to
be
leading
her
round
the
house
it
turned
several
corners
and
ended
in
a
long
gallery
this
looked
more
cheerful
for
the
sun
shone
in
through
the
large
end
window
and
brightened
the
cracked
old
walls
she
danced
along
the
floor
with
quite
a
return
of
high
spirits
i
wish
the
bumble
would
let
us
come
up
here
on
wet
days
it
would
be
a
glorious
place
for
games
nicer
by
far
than
the
barn
i
call
it
mean
of
her
to
lock
up
all
this
part
of
the
house
we
have
absolutely
topping
fun
i
say
what
that
little
door
over
there
the
door
in
question
was
very
small
and
quite
low
down
on
a
level
with
the
floor
raymonde
went
on
her
hands
and
knees
to
investigate
it
was
secured
with
a
bolt
which
she
easily
opened
to
her
surprise
she
found
herself
looking
out
upon
the
roof
whether
it
had
been
constructed
in
past
days
to
provide
a
means
of
escape
from
danger
or
merely
to
allow
workmen
to
replace
loose
tiles
it
was
impossible
to
say
it
was
certainly
within
the
bounds
of
probability
to
imagine
a
jacobite
with
a
price
set
on
his
life
creeping
through
the
little
opening
to
find
a
more
secure
among
the
twisted
chimneys
while
king
george
soldiers
searched
the
mansion
below
raymonde
put
her
head
out
the
roof
sloped
steeply
up
in
front
to
a
girl
of
her
temperament
the
temptation
to
explore
farther
was
irresistible
she
squeezed
through
the
small
door
and
wriggled
out
on
her
hands
and
knees
on
to
the
tiles
she
was
in
the
angle
of
a
small
gable
she
could
see
roof
all
round
her
and
sky
above
still
on
hands
and
knees
she
began
to
creep
upwards
the
old
tiles
had
mellowed
to
dull
red
and
orange
and
were
partly
covered
with
moss
she
could
not
help
admiring
the
artistic
beauty
of
their
colour
she
reached
the
ridge
and
peered
over
apparently
she
was
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
the
roof
for
a
tall
twisted
stack
of
chimneys
reared
itself
close
by
and
gables
spread
on
all
sides
she
went
cautiously
down
the
next
incline
and
up
to
the
summit
of
a
further
ridge
which
was
higher
here
by
standing
up
and
holding
on
to
a
chimney
ledge
she
had
an
excellent
view
she
could
not
see
the
courtyard
but
she
could
command
the
bottom
of
the
orchard
the
moat
the
fields
that
led
to
the
river
and
the
cliffs
and
woods
beyond
it
was
quite
a
prospect
she
seemed
to
be
looking
on
to
the
top
of
everything
the
cattle
in
the
meadows
appeared
mere
specks
and
a
cart
and
horses
passing
over
the
bridge
were
like
a
child
toy
it
was
fascinating
to
watch
them
vanishing
down
the
road
raymonde
was
in
no
hurry
to
return
she
stood
for
quite
a
long
time
enjoying
an
exhilarating
sense
of
being
on
the
summit
of
a
mountain
at
last
the
recollection
that
it
must
be
nearly
preparation
time
recalled
her
to
the
necessity
of
departure
with
a
sigh
of
regret
she
dropped
back
on
to
the
ridge
and
crawled
over
the
gables
again
she
was
sure
that
she
had
left
the
little
door
open
behind
her
but
when
she
approached
it
she
saw
that
it
was
shut
perhaps
the
wind
had
blown
it
to
she
put
out
her
hand
to
fling
it
open
but
it
did
not
yield
she
pushed
harder
pressing
with
all
her
force
it
remained
immovable
then
the
awful
truth
burst
upon
her
somebody
had
latched
the
door
on
the
inside
and
she
was
locked
out
upon
the
roof
had
miss
beasley
or
miss
gibbs
been
taking
a
survey
of
the
attics
no
matter
who
it
was
the
horrible
result
remained
the
same
what
was
she
to
do
she
beat
wildly
at
the
door
hoping
to
break
it
in
but
oak
and
bolts
were
made
of
stuff
too
strong
for
a
girl
hands
she
shouted
and
called
knowing
all
the
time
that
it
was
of
little
avail
whoever
bolted
the
door
must
have
gone
away
miss
gibbs
laboratory
was
at
the
other
side
of
the
house
and
she
might
scream
herself
hoarse
without
anyone
hearing
her
for
a
minute
or
two
she
sat
huddled
up
in
despair
would
she
have
to
spend
the
night
on
the
roof
it
was
a
ghastly
prospect
hot
tears
came
welling
up
but
she
dashed
them
away
angrily
her
innate
pluck
rose
to
the
surface
she
had
been
in
difficult
even
dangerous
positions
before
and
had
escaped
surely
there
must
be
some
way
out
of
this
i
climb
farther
on
over
the
roof
she
decided
if
i
can
get
nearer
the
edge
perhaps
someone
may
see
me
the
chance
of
rescue
meant
admitting
her
adventure
and
incurring
great
wrath
at
but
that
was
a
lesser
evil
than
passing
a
night
on
the
roof
she
crawled
to
her
old
and
descended
to
the
right
where
a
gable
sloped
steeply
at
the
bottom
she
passed
along
a
wide
gutter
and
rounding
a
corner
found
that
she
could
easily
drop
on
to
a
lower
portion
of
the
roof
she
was
in
a
state
of
tense
excitement
where
was
she
getting
to
would
anybody
see
her
from
the
courtyard
and
if
so
how
would
they
propose
to
rescue
her
it
would
be
difficult
to
shout
down
and
explain
that
she
had
come
through
the
little
door
in
the
upper
gallery
she
was
on
a
much
lower
level
now
than
when
she
had
first
started
she
crawled
on
with
hands
and
knees
rather
sore
and
scraped
with
the
tiles
another
corner
and
another
short
drop
she
was
nearing
the
edge
of
the
parapet
she
must
creep
down
this
next
piece
of
roof
there
was
another
wide
gutter
at
the
bottom
she
walked
along
this
rounded
a
jutting
and
then
paused
with
a
cry
facing
her
was
a
small
door
identical
with
the
one
by
which
she
had
emerged
could
it
possibly
be
open
she
stumbled
up
to
it
and
pressed
it
with
trembling
fingers
it
yielded
easily
the
next
moment
she
was
creeping
through
raymonde
now
found
herself
inside
a
cupboard
full
of
old
lumber
the
dust
was
thick
and
surely
had
not
been
disturbed
for
years
some
broken
chairs
with
seats
were
piled
together
and
some
ancient
boxes
lay
full
of
rubbish
straw
old
books
hanks
of
rope
and
other
miscellaneous
things
occupied
the
corner
there
was
a
door
opposite
without
either
latch
or
knob
raymonde
with
some
difficulty
managed
to
pull
it
open
and
stepped
out
into
a
passage
when
she
pushed
the
door
to
behind
her
she
noticed
that
it
fitted
so
exactly
into
the
oak
panelling
as
to
be
quite
undiscernible
could
it
be
a
secret
cupboard
she
wondered
if
miss
beasley
knew
of
its
existence
there
was
a
window
close
by
she
looked
out
and
took
her
bearings
apparently
she
was
just
over
the
big
dormitory
the
tiles
across
which
she
had
crawled
to
enter
the
cupboard
must
have
been
those
of
miss
gibbs
bedroom
the
landing
where
she
found
herself
at
present
led
to
the
servants
quarters
the
staircase
was
to
her
right
raymonde
hurried
down
without
meeting
anybody
washed
the
dust
and
dirt
off
her
hands
and
walked
in
to
preparation
in
the
very
nick
of
time
chapter
v
tactics
it
was
an
unfortunate
truth
that
miss
gibbs
was
not
very
popular
at
the
grange
she
was
clever
conscientious
and
and
preserved
a
high
ideal
of
girlhood
much
too
high
for
practical
use
so
her
pupils
maintained
this
is
a
school
for
saints
grumbled
valentine
one
day
if
we
followed
all
gibbie
pet
precepts
we
should
have
halos
round
our
heads
and
be
sprouting
wings
added
raymonde
a
very
uncomfortable
process
too
i
expect
it
would
hurt
like
cutting
teeth
and
it
would
spoil
the
fit
of
one
blouses
i
do
want
to
be
an
angel
i
quite
content
with
this
world
at
present
i
so
tired
of
developing
my
capabilities
sighed
fauvette
one
never
gets
half
an
hour
now
just
to
have
fun
miss
gibbs
who
aspired
to
a
partnership
in
the
school
was
deeply
concerned
this
term
with
the
general
culture
and
mental
outlook
of
her
charges
she
had
attended
an
educational
congress
during
the
easter
holidays
and
came
back
primed
with
the
very
latest
theories
she
was
determined
to
work
on
the
most
modern
methods
and
to
turn
her
pupils
out
into
the
world
a
little
band
of
ardent
thinkers
logical
anxious
for
the
development
of
their
sex
yearning
for
careers
in
fact
the
vanguard
of
a
new
womanhood
unfortunately
her
material
was
not
altogether
promising
a
few
earnest
spirits
such
as
maudie
heywood
responded
to
her
appeals
but
the
generality
were
slow
to
move
they
listened
to
her
impassioned
addresses
on
women
suffrage
without
a
spark
of
animation
and
sat
stolidly
while
she
descanted
upon
the
bad
conditions
of
labour
among
munition
girls
and
the
need
for
lady
welfare
workers
the
fact
was
that
her
pupils
did
not
care
an
atom
about
the
position
of
their
sex
a
was
far
more
to
them
than
the
vote
and
their
own
grievances
loomed
larger
than
those
of
factory
hands
they
considered
that
they
had
a
very
decided
grievance
at
present
miss
gibbs
acting
on
the
advice
of
a
book
entitled
out
of
school
was
determined
that
every
moment
of
the
day
should
be
filled
with
some
occupation
that
led
to
culture
she
carefully
explained
that
the
word
recreation
meant
a
creating
again
not
a
mere
period
of
frivolity
or
and
advocated
that
all
intervals
of
leisure
should
be
devoted
to
intellectual
interests
she
frowned
on
girls
who
sauntered
round
the
garden
or
sat
giggling
in
the
and
suggested
suitable
employments
for
their
idle
hands
and
brains
never
waste
a
precious
minute
was
her
motto
and
the
girls
groaned
under
it
healthy
hobbies
were
all
very
well
but
to
be
urged
to
ride
them
in
season
and
out
of
season
was
distinctly
trying
one
effort
on
miss
part
met
with
particular
disapproval
she
had
decided
to
take
the
girls
on
saturday
afternoons
to
visit
various
old
castles
roman
camps
and
other
objects
of
historical
and
arch√¶ological
interest
in
the
neighbourhood
on
former
similar
occasions
she
had
been
in
the
habit
of
delivering
a
short
lecture
when
on
the
spot
but
noticing
that
many
of
the
girls
were
so
distracted
with
gazing
at
the
surroundings
that
they
were
not
really
listening
she
determined
that
they
should
absorb
the
knowledge
before
visiting
the
place
she
wrote
careful
notes
therefore
upon
the
subject
of
their
next
ramble
and
giving
them
out
in
class
ordered
each
girl
to
copy
them
and
to
commit
them
to
memory
the
result
of
her
injunction
was
an
outburst
of
almost
mutinous
indignation
in
form
when
does
she
expect
us
to
do
it
i
should
like
to
know
raged
morvyth
there
not
a
moment
to
spare
in
so
i
suppose
it
will
have
to
come
out
of
our
recreation
look
here
i
call
this
the
very
limit
saturday
afternoon
no
holiday
when
we
got
to
go
prowling
round
a
wretched
roman
camp
mourned
valentine
what
do
i
care
about
ancient
earthworks
if
they
were
modern
trenches
now
with
soldiers
in
them
it
would
be
something
like
there
be
nothing
to
see
except
some
mounds
i
suppose
we
shall
have
to
stand
round
and
listen
while
she
holds
forth
and
look
and
i
do
know
whether
she
going
to
hold
forth
herself
said
aveline
i
hear
she
invited
several
people
from
an
arch√¶ological
society
to
meet
us
there
and
probably
one
of
them
will
do
the
spouting
some
wheezy
old
gentleman
with
a
bald
head
or
an
elderly
lady
in
a
waterproof
and
spectacles
one
knows
the
sort
oh
good
biz
exclaimed
raymonde
if
visitors
are
coming
have
to
talk
to
them
and
she
wo
have
so
much
time
to
look
after
us
she
welcome
to
the
bald
old
boys
let
her
have
half
a
dozen
if
she
wants
you
forget
you
got
to
listen
to
them
oh
i
listen
at
least
i
look
serious
and
politely
absorbed
that
all
that
expected
in
the
meantime
we
these
wretched
notes
to
copy
groused
katherine
have
we
i
do
think
so
i
got
an
idea
maudie
heywood
sure
to
make
a
most
beautiful
copperplate
copy
we
borrow
hers
and
just
skim
them
over
to
get
a
kind
of
general
acquaintance
with
the
subject
sufficient
to
show
interest
gibbie
wo
be
able
to
question
us
with
those
other
people
there
but
suppose
she
asks
beforehand
to
see
our
notes
i
thought
of
that
we
each
copy
out
the
first
page
and
stick
some
old
exercise
sheets
behind
it
she
never
find
out
the
mystic
seven
looked
at
their
leader
in
admiration
they
considered
that
on
such
occasions
her
resourcefulness
amounted
to
genius
they
followed
her
advice
and
copied
the
front
page
only
of
the
notes
placing
underneath
some
portions
of
latin
translation
or
historical
essay
aveline
underlined
her
title
with
red
ink
morvyth
ruled
a
neat
margin
and
fauvette
tied
her
sheets
together
with
a
piece
of
the
blue
baby
ribbon
which
she
used
for
threading
through
her
underclothes
on
the
outside
at
any
rate
their
copies
looked
most
presentable
it
was
only
the
fifth
form
who
were
accorded
the
privilege
of
the
ramble
they
were
miss
gibbs
special
charge
this
term
miss
beasley
devoting
herself
to
the
sixth
and
mademoiselle
looking
after
the
juniors
the
fifth
hardly
appreciated
receiving
the
lion
share
of
miss
gibbs
attention
they
complained
that
she
tried
all
her
educational
experiments
upon
them
they
were
ready
however
the
whole
ten
of
them
on
saturday
afternoon
clad
in
the
neat
school
uniform
brown
serge
skirt
khaki
blouse
scarlet
tie
and
hat
miss
gibbs
viewed
them
with
approval
each
had
slung
over
her
shoulders
a
vasculum
for
botanical
or
other
specimens
and
each
carried
in
her
hand
a
copy
of
the
notes
they
looked
healthy
well
trained
and
alert
with
intelligence
altogether
an
excellent
advertisement
for
the
school
and
its
modern
methods
the
camp
was
about
a
walk
from
the
grange
so
the
form
had
at
least
the
satisfaction
of
obtaining
exercise
as
valentine
had
prophesied
it
consisted
of
some
mounds
in
the
middle
of
a
field
where
to
fauvette
infinite
discomposure
some
cows
were
grazing
the
members
of
the
arch√¶ological
society
had
already
arrived
and
came
forward
to
greet
miss
gibbs
there
was
a
large
stout
gentleman
with
a
grey
moustache
and
bushy
overhanging
eyebrows
also
a
little
thin
gentleman
with
a
pointed
beard
and
an
argumentative
voice
a
tall
lady
with
a
high
colour
who
carried
a
and
a
younger
man
who
was
trying
to
spread
out
an
ordnance
map
these
seemed
to
be
the
principal
members
of
the
party
though
there
were
a
few
stragglers
professor
edwards
my
girls
said
miss
gibbs
introducing
the
form
to
the
leader
for
the
afternoon
the
stout
gentleman
smiled
blandly
and
murmured
some
suitable
remark
about
the
value
of
acquiring
antiquarian
tastes
while
still
young
i
had
perhaps
better
read
my
short
paper
before
we
inspect
the
remains
he
added
goody
he
surely
is
going
to
disinter
any
dead
romans
to
show
us
is
he
whispered
katherine
bunkum
replied
ardiune
nothing
as
thrilling
as
that
do
you
fear
miss
gibbs
smiled
encouragingly
to
the
form
and
beckoned
them
to
draw
nearer
they
arranged
themselves
in
a
respectful
semicircle
with
attentive
eyes
fixed
on
the
lecturer
and
copies
of
notes
rather
conspicuously
flaunted
he
discoursed
exhaustively
on
the
subject
of
roman
camps
in
general
and
the
girls
listened
with
receptive
faces
but
minds
wandering
upon
more
modern
themes
morvyth
was
speculating
whether
it
would
be
possible
to
purchase
chocolates
on
the
way
home
fauvette
was
planning
her
next
party
frock
and
aveline
was
wondering
whether
there
would
be
jam
or
honey
for
tea
that
day
before
i
ask
you
to
take
a
personal
survey
of
the
earthworks
concluded
the
professor
i
should
like
to
have
miss
gibbs
opinion
as
to
the
exact
position
of
the
entrance
and
the
approximate
date
of
construction
she
has
i
know
made
a
study
of
this
branch
of
arch√¶ology
my
ideas
are
embodied
in
my
notes
purred
miss
gibbs
perhaps
you
would
not
mind
reading
the
paragraph
i
lent
them
a
short
time
ago
to
mrs
gladwin
professor
edwards
turned
expectantly
but
the
tall
lady
who
a
moment
before
had
been
at
his
elbow
had
strayed
away
papers
in
hand
and
was
not
available
for
reference
my
girls
all
have
copies
of
the
notes
pass
yours
ardiune
smiled
the
mistress
the
luckless
ardiune
blushed
scarlet
but
dared
not
disobey
the
passage
occurs
about
the
middle
prompted
miss
gibbs
as
the
professor
fumbled
with
the
pages
may
i
find
it
for
you
why
surely
there
must
be
some
mistake
this
is
french
valentine
your
copy
child
with
an
even
more
crimson
countenance
valentine
tendered
her
manuscript
which
consisted
of
last
week
essay
on
comets
miss
gibbs
with
a
growing
tightness
round
her
lips
inspected
extracts
from
chaucer
and
katherine
translation
of
virgil
before
aveline
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
hand
up
maudie
heywood
copy
it
is
unwise
for
a
mistress
to
show
temper
before
visitors
and
miss
gibbs
with
admirable
mastered
her
feelings
and
read
the
paragraph
calmly
during
the
discussion
which
followed
the
girls
availed
themselves
of
an
invitation
from
the
gentleman
to
inspect
the
earthworks
and
thankfully
fled
to
the
farthest
limits
of
the
field
they
knew
of
course
that
it
was
only
putting
off
the
evil
hour
and
further
events
justified
their
forebodings
miss
gibbs
preserved
an
ominous
silence
on
the
way
home
and
after
tea
summoned
the
form
to
their
where
she
went
into
exhaustive
details
of
the
whole
business
i
disgusted
with
you
utterly
disgusted
she
declared
it
seems
of
little
use
to
spend
time
in
attempting
to
give
you
intellectual
interests
those
girls
who
did
not
copy
the
notes
will
stay
in
now
and
write
them
i
shall
look
at
them
all
at
eight
it
means
a
good
solid
hour
work

raymonde

chapter
vi
a
midnight
scare
miss
gibbs
plans
for
the
enlargement
of
her
pupils
minds
ran
over
a
wide
range
of
subjects
from
arch√¶ology
to
ambulance
as
they
expressed
it
she
was
always
springing
some
fresh
surprise
upon
them
like
bees
they
were
expected
to
sip
mental
honey
from
many
intellectual
flowers
they
had
dabbled
in
chemistry
till
ardiune
spilt
acid
down
miss
gibbs
dress
after
which
the
experiments
suddenly
stopped
they
had
collected
fruits
and
had
studied
animalcul√¶
through
the
microscope
and
modelled
fungi
in
plasticine
stencilling
illuminating
painting
and
marqueterie
each
had
a
brief
turn
and
were
superseded
by
and
miss
beasley
suggested
tentatively
that
it
might
be
better
to
concentrate
on
a
single
subject
but
miss
gibbs
who
loved
arguments
about
education
was
well
prepared
to
defend
her
line
of
action
there
is
always
a
danger
in
specialization
she
replied
you
tell
how
a
girl
tastes
will
run
till
you
give
her
an
opportunity
of
proving
them
my
theory
is
let
them
try
each
separate
craft
and
then
choose
their
own
hobbies
one
will
take
naturally
to
another
may
find
clay
or
gesso
her
means
of
artistic
expression
some
minds
delight
in
pure
greek
outline
while
others
revel
in
the
intricacies
of
celtic
ornament
again
a
girl
with
no
√¶sthetic
sense
may
be
enraptured
with
the
wonders
of
the
microscope
and
those
who
find
a
difficulty
in
mastering
the
technical
terms
of
botany
may
yet
excel
in
the
extent
of
their
collections
of
specimens
who
would
have
imagined
that
veronica
terry
would
develop
an
interest
in
geology
i
had
always
considered
her
a
remarkably
dull
child
but
her
fossils
formed
the
nucleus
of
the
school
museum
i
have
hopes
at
present
that
one
or
two
of
my
girls
are
developing
tastes
that
will
last
them
for
life
it
was
one
of
miss
gibbs
pet
theories
that
not
only
should
her
pupils
have
the
opportunity
of
sampling
arts
handicrafts
and
scientific
pursuits
but
that
they
should
in
every
respect
cultivate
a
wide
mental
horizon
she
was
fond
of
suggesting
emergencies
to
them
and
asking
how
they
would
act
in
special
circumstances
imagine
yourself
left
a
widow
she
had
once
propounded
with
three
small
children
to
support
and
a
capital
of
only
three
hundred
pounds
how
would
you
employ
this
sum
to
the
best
advantage
so
as
to
provide
some
future
means
of
subsistence
for
yourself
and
family
the
opinions
of
the
form
had
been
interesting
and
had
varied
from
poultry
farming
to
the
establishment
of
a
or
the
setting
up
of
the
most
original
suggestion
however
was
contributed
by
fauvette
and
while
it
outraged
miss
gibbs
sense
of
propriety
caused
infinite
hilarity
in
the
form
if
i
were
left
a
widow
she
wrote
i
should
get
the
children
into
orphanages
or
persuade
rich
friends
to
adopt
them
then
i
would
spend
the
three
hundred
pounds
in
buying
new
clothes
and
staying
at
the
best
hotels
and
try
to
get
married
again
to
somebody
who
could
provide
for
me
better
among
the
flights
of
fancy
in
which
the
fifth
form
were
forced
to
indulge
were
a
railway
collision
a
fire
a
bicycle
accident
an
escape
of
gas
the
swallowing
of
poison
the
bursting
of
the
kitchen
boiler
a
case
of
choking
and
an
infectious
epidemic
on
the
whole
they
rather
enjoyed
the
fun
of
airing
their
views
and
when
asked
to
propose
fresh
topics
had
suggested
such
startling
catastrophes
as
a
german
invasion
a
revolution
a
volcanic
eruption
a
famine
and
a
zeppelin
raid
rejecting
the
first
four
miss
gibbs
had
chosen
the
last
for
discussion
and
for
fully
ten
minutes
the
form
in
imagination
dwelt
in
an
atmosphere
of
explosives
they
clutched
their
few
valuables
that
were
within
reach
donned
and
bedroom
slippers
each
seized
a
blanket
and
all
descended
to
the
cellars
with
the
utmost
dispatch
of
which
they
were
capable
while
bombs
came
crashing
through
the
roof
and
the
walls
of
the
house
tottered
to
ruin
i
shall
never
dare
to
go
to
sleep
again
shivered
fauvette
appalled
at
the
mental
picture
presented
to
her
are
the
zepps
likely
to
come
miss
gibbs
enquired
ardiune
not
so
likely
at
this
time
of
year
as
in
winter
still
of
course
one
never
can
tell
replied
the
mistress
anxious
to
justify
the
usefulness
of
her
emergency
lessons
it
is
wise
to
know
what
to
do
we
ought
all
to
adopt
the
boy
scouts
motto
prepared
and
suppose
we
ever
do
hear
dreadful
noises
in
the
middle
of
the
night
said
raymonde
gazing
with
solemn
awestruck
eyes
at
the
teacher
then
you
must
make
for
the
cellar
without
delay
replied
miss
gibbs
emphatically
if
she
could
have
seen
raymonde
expression
as
that
young
lady
turned
her
head
for
a
moment
towards
aveline
she
would
have
been
surprised
the
serious
apprehension
had
changed
to
dancing
mischief
even
so
a
mistress
as
miss
gibbs
however
can
not
be
aware
of
every
in
her
form
human
nature
has
its
limits
raymonde
left
the
chuckling
to
herself
and
at
the
earliest
convenient
moment
summoned
a
committee
of
the
mystic
seven
i
got
the
idea
of
my
life
she
declared
it
is
often
i
have
a
really
topping
notion
but
this
is
one
of
those
inspirations
that
come
sometimes
one
does
know
how
you
need
be
quite
so
peacocky
about
it
chirruped
katherine
other
people
have
ideas
occasionally
as
well
as
you
ah
but
wait
till
you
heard
mine
and
then
you
allow
i
some
reason
to
look
here
do
you
think
it
extremely
nice
to
be
philanthropic
do
know
replied
the
others
doubtfully
they
distrusted
raymonde
philanthropy
and
were
unwilling
to
commit
themselves
it
so
nice
to
do
things
for
others
continued
their
schoolmate
gushingly
when
somebody
has
been
looking
forward
to
an
event
just
think
of
the
bliss
of
being
able
to
bring
it
to
pass
one
would
feel
a
sort
of
mixture
of
santa
claus
and
cinderella
fairy
godmother
go
on
murmured
the
mystics
well
you
see
what
i
mean
is
this
gibbie
been
taking
ever
such
a
lot
of
trouble
to
teach
us
how
to
act
in
emergencies
she
must
have
spent
hours
thinking
out
those
problems
i
sometimes
feel
girls
that
we
do
not
sufficiently
appreciate
our
teachers
the
grimaces
of
the
six
were
eloquent
get
to
the
point
suggested
ardiune
i
getting
well
you
know
we
all
very
grateful
to
gibbie
and
interested
in
the
problems
and
happy
in
our
work
and
all
the
rest
of
it
i
think
we
ought
to
do
something
to
make
a
little
return
to
her
for
her
kindness
now
it
must
be
very
disappointing
to
coach
us
up
for
these
emergencies
and
never
have
an
opportunity
of
putting
what
been
taught
into
practice
if
we
could
show
her
that
her
lessons
have
sunk
in
and
that
we
could
face
a
sudden
catastrophe
with
calm
courage
and
prompt
presence
of
mind
then
she
feel
her
labour
had
not
been
in
vain
she
really
deserves
it
we
ca
burst
the
kitchen
boiler
or
set
the
cook
on
fire
to
oblige
her
objected
valentine
certainly
not
but
there
are
other
emergencies
with
proper
preparation
we
might
engineer
a
very
neat
little
zepp
raid
quite
sufficient
to
put
every
theory
into
practice
smiles
illuminated
the
faces
of
the
committee
they
began
to
see
daylight
raymonde
her
hair
ribbon
and
continued
on
that
afternoon
when
i
went
exploring
i
discovered
a
way
on
to
the
roof
exactly
over
gibbie
bedroom
now
what
you
got
to
do
for
the
next
few
days
is
to
collect
old
tins
there
ought
to
be
plenty
of
them
about
you
can
leave
the
rest
to
me
the
result
of
raymonde
suggestion
was
an
extraordinary
activity
on
the
part
of
her
friends
in
the
acquisition
of
any
species
of
discarded
can
they
begged
empty
cocoa
tins
from
the
cook
and
even
climbed
over
the
wall
on
to
the
rubbish
heap
to
rescue
specimens
rusty
or
otherwise
that
lay
there
unnoticed
and
unappropriated
each
can
was
furnished
with
four
or
five
large
pebbles
inside
and
was
secured
at
the
end
with
brown
paper
if
the
original
lid
was
lost
they
were
packed
in
baskets
and
hidden
away
in
a
corner
of
the
barn
until
they
were
wanted
raymonde
regarded
her
preparations
with
much
satisfaction
it
ought
to
be
enough
to
wake
the
dead
she
said
rattling
one
of
the
tins
in
demonstration
as
has
been
before
explained
the
members
of
the
fourth
and
fifth
forms
nineteen
girls
in
all
slept
in
the
huge
chamber
which
occupied
an
entire
wing
of
the
house
and
had
been
the
dormitory
of
the
french
nuns
a
hundred
years
ago
the
small
room
at
the
end
formerly
the
cell
of
the
mother
superior
was
now
the
bower
of
miss
gibbs
it
had
two
doors
one
leading
into
the
passage
and
another
into
the
dormitory
so
that
she
could
keep
an
eye
upon
the
nineteen
inmates
it
was
a
very
unnecessary
arrangement
to
have
her
so
near
the
girls
considered
for
she
would
come
popping
in
immediately
if
they
made
a
noise
they
envied
the
sixth
who
slept
in
little
bedrooms
along
the
corridor
and
wished
miss
gibbs
had
possessed
a
lesser
sense
of
duty
and
a
greater
appreciation
of
luxury
so
that
she
might
have
chosen
a
more
comfortable
and
spacious
bedroom
elsewhere
when
sufficient
ammunition
had
been
prepared
raymonde
carried
the
baskets
upstairs
by
stealth
and
hid
them
in
the
lumber
cupboard
which
she
had
discovered
on
the
day
she
had
explored
the
roof
they
were
not
likely
to
be
disturbed
here
for
probably
no
one
save
herself
knew
of
the
existence
of
the
tiny
room
she
crept
through
the
small
door
on
to
the
tiles
and
verified
her
position
by
cautious
tapping
to
which
morvyth
stationed
in
the
passage
below
with
a
hockey
stick
replied
having
thus
taken
her
exact
bearings
she
felt
that
the
whole
plot
was
in
good
training
we
must
choose
a
moonlight
night
or
i
should
be
able
to
see
my
way
over
the
roof
she
informed
the
committee
of
course
zepps
generally
come
when
there
a
moon
but
there
be
no
time
for
anybody
to
think
of
that
you
know
your
part
of
the
business
ra
ther
the
household
at
the
grange
retired
early
to
rest
miss
gibbs
who
was
an
ardent
advocate
of
daylight
saving
and
always
rose
at
six
was
generally
in
bed
by
eleven
on
the
theory
that
it
is
impossible
to
burn
a
candle
at
both
ends
as
a
rule
every
occupant
of
the
long
dormitory
was
wrapt
in
slumber
before
that
hour
and
the
mistress
taking
a
last
peep
at
the
rows
of
small
beds
would
hear
nothing
but
peaceful
breathing
on
one
particular
evening
however
when
she
made
her
usual
survey
of
the
room
seven
of
the
apparent
sleepers
were
foxing
they
lay
with
closed
eyes
and
composed
faces
but
inwardly
they
were
particularly
lively
each
one
had
solemnly
passed
her
word
to
keep
awake
and
considered
herself
on
sentry
duty
to
pass
the
time
they
had
brought
acid
drops
to
bed
with
them
and
sucked
them
slowly
so
as
to
make
them
last
as
long
as
possible
they
dared
not
talk
for
fear
of
disturbing
the
others
though
the
temptation
was
great
occasionally
a
stealthy
hand
would
reach
over
to
the
next
bed
to
make
sure
of
its
occupant
vigilance
and
the
squeeze
would
be
passed
on
down
the
row
of
seven
when
the
old
grandfather
clock
on
the
stairs
chimed
midnight
raymonde
and
morvyth
rose
quietly
and
donned
and
bedroom
slippers
then
with
a
final
signal
to
their
fellow
mystics
crept
cautiously
out
of
the
room
the
passage
was
very
dark
but
morvyth
had
brought
her
electric
torch
and
flashed
a
ray
of
light
in
front
of
them
it
felt
decidedly
spooky
and
they
were
thankful
to
be
together
they
went
up
the
stairs
towards
the
servants
quarters
and
along
an
upper
landing
by
the
aid
of
the
torch
it
was
not
difficult
to
find
the
secret
door
among
the
panelling
the
little
looked
horribly
dark
it
needed
an
effort
of
will
to
enter
among
its
dim
shadows
a
rat
was
gnawing
in
the
corner
and
scurried
away
with
noise
enough
for
a
lion
raymonde
peeped
through
the
small
door
on
to
the
roof
outside
the
moon
was
shining
brilliantly
she
could
see
each
separate
tile
as
clearly
as
by
daylight
the
sight
restored
her
courage
i
creep
through
and
then
you
hand
me
the
baskets
she
whispered
i
know
just
the
place
to
drop
the
tins
they
go
plump
and
roll
down
the
whole
length
of
the
gable
old
sport
returned
morvyth
miss
gibbs
lay
in
her
bedroom
sleeping
the
sleep
of
the
just
the
moonlight
flooding
through
her
hygienically
window
revealed
the
rows
of
photographs
on
her
the
volumes
on
her
and
the
little
emergency
medicine
cupboard
on
the
wall
was
she
dreaming
of
the
lesson
she
meant
to
give
or
of
the
officer
whose
portrait
in
the
silver
frame
occupied
the
post
of
honour
in
her
picture
gallery
who
could
tell
unsympathetic
do
not
know
all
the
secrets
of
a
life
perhaps
miss
gibbs
like
the
familiar
chestnut
burr
hid
a
silver
lining
under
her
prickly
exterior
she
slept
so
peacefully
it
was
a
shame
to
disturb
her
schoolgirls
are
ruthless
beings
at
best
bang
rattle
bang
bump
she
woke
with
a
start
projectiles
were
falling
upon
the
roof
with
terrific
force
at
the
same
moment
shrieks
issued
from
the
dormitory
and
a
wild
shout
of
zepps
miss
presence
of
mind
did
not
desert
her
it
took
her
exactly
three
seconds
to
put
on
her
and
bedroom
slippers
two
more
to
sweep
her
watch
purse
and
a
little
packet
of
treasures
placed
nightly
in
readiness
into
the
ample
pocket
of
her
wrapper
and
the
next
instant
she
was
flashing
her
torchlight
in
the
dormitory
the
girls
most
of
them
very
scared
were
turning
out
of
bed
aveline
fauvette
valentine
ardiune
and
katherine
were
already
garbed
and
encouraging
the
others
before
a
minute
and
a
half
had
elapsed
the
whole
party
was
on
its
way
to
the
cellar
having
rung
the
great
bell
on
the
stairs
to
warn
the
rest
of
the
household
raymonde
and
morvyth
having
expended
the
ammunition
hurried
downstairs
and
slipped
in
among
their
form
mates
unobserved
the
school
spent
an
agitated
hour
in
the
cellar
sitting
on
blankets
clutched
from
their
beds
as
all
appeared
quiet
and
no
more
mysterious
thumps
resounded
on
the
roof
miss
beasley
who
had
reconnoitred
declared
it
safe
to
return
to
roost
and
ordered
her
pupils
upstairs
again
possibly
she
had
her
suspicions
for
very
early
next
morning
she
went
out
to
investigate
the
extent
of
the
damage
and
discovered
a
selection
of
the
projectiles
lying
on
the
lawn
the
result
was
a
solemn
harangue
to
the
whole
school
i
do
know
who
has
played
this
contemptible
practical
joke
she
proclaimed
witheringly
it
may
seem
humorous
to
small
minds
but
to
me
it
is
pitiable
there
were
no
doubt
instigators
amongst
you
and
for
the
sake
of
those
ringleaders
i
shall
punish
you
all
you
will
spend
wednesday
afternoon
in
your
copying
out
instead
of
taking
our
projected
trip
on
the
river
it
is
hard
to
punish
the
innocent
with
the
guilty
but
those
responsible
for
this
occurrence
are
probably
known
to
their
companions
who
will
i
hope
visit
their
displeasure
upon
them
and
cause
them
to
regret
that
they
have
deprived
the
school
of
a
holiday
miss
beasley
method
of
punishment
though
voted
abominably
unfair
by
the
majority
was
certainly
efficacious
such
grave
suspicion
fell
on
the
mystic
seven
that
the
indignant
monitresses
took
the
matter
in
hand
and
insisted
on
investigating
the
entire
business
popular
opinion
raged
hotly
against
the
culprits
for
the
promised
expedition
to
the
river
had
been
regarded
as
the
treat
of
the
term
i
believe
it
all
your
fault
raymonde
armitage
scolded
linda
mottram
if
there
any
mischief
about
one
may
be
sure
you
at
the
bottom
of
it
we
do
want
your
monkey
tricks
here
they
on
the
level
of
a
kindergarten
for
little
boys
if
anything
more
of
this
sort
happens
you
may
expect
to
find
yourself
jolly
well
boycotted
i
sha
speak
to
you
in
any
case
for
a
week
and
i
hope
none
of
the
other
monitresses
will
you
deserve
sending
to
coventry
by
everybody
how
hard
it
is
to
be
mourned
raymonde
to
her
chums
afterwards
i
sure
i
gave
everybody
a
treat
and
especially
gibbie
i
a
martyr
to
the
cause
of
emergencies
for
goodness
sake
do
any
of
you
drink
poison
by
mistake
or
they
lay
the
blame
on
me
and
send
me
to
the
gallows
chapter
vii
the
crystal
gazers
it
was
about
this
time
that
a
wave
of
the
occult
passed
over
the
school
it
began
with
daphne
johnson
who
happened
to
read
a
magazine
article
on
the
borderland
of
the
spirit
world
and
it
spread
like
an
epidemic
of
influenza
the
supernatural
was
the
topic
of
the
hour
ghost
stories
were
at
a
premium
and
any
girl
who
could
relate
some
creepy
spiritual
experience
which
had
happened
to
the
second
cousin
of
a
friend
of
a
friend
of
hers
was
sure
of
a
thrilled
audience
this
taste
for
the
psychic
was
particularly
strong
among
the
girls
of
the
sixth
form
who
leaned
towards
its
intellectual
and
scientific
aspects
they
despised
vulgar
apparitions
but
discussed
such
abstruse
problems
as
phantasms
of
the
living
thought
transference
will
power
hypnotism
and
clairvoyance
meta
wright
dabbled
a
little
in
palmistry
and
examined
the
hands
of
her
schoolmates
prophesying
startling
events
in
their
future
careers
lois
barlow
sent
to
a
ladies
newspaper
to
have
her
horoscope
cast
and
was
terribly
dejected
at
the
gloomy
prospects
offered
her
by
the
planets
till
she
fortunately
discovered
that
she
had
put
the
date
of
her
birth
wrong
by
three
hours
which
would
of
course
completely
alter
the
aspect
of
the
heavenly
bodies
and
cause
the
best
of
astrologers
to
err
veronica
terry
talked
darkly
of
experiences
in
the
psychic
world
of
astral
bodies
etheric
doubles
elemental
entities
and
nature
spirits
she
went
to
sleep
at
night
with
her
thumbs
and
big
toes
crossed
in
the
hope
of
bringing
back
the
adventures
of
her
dreams
into
her
waking
consciousness
she
was
a
little
hazy
on
the
subject
but
yearned
for
further
instruction
it
called
she
confided
to
her
particular
chum
barbara
rowlands
you
concentrate
your
mind
before
you
go
to
sleep
and
then
you
able
to
function
in
the
astral
body
my
cousin
winnie
told
me
of
a
girl
at
college
who
did
it
and
she
was
seen
standing
in
the
room
of
a
friend
at
the
other
side
of
the
hostel
while
all
the
time
she
was
asleep
in
bed
i
hope
you
wo
do
that
shuddered
barbara
nervously
it
would
give
me
a
fit
if
i
woke
up
and
found
you
staring
at
me
and
knew
it
was
really
you
promise
you
wo
it
may
be
rather
difficult
to
regulate
one
movements
once
one
is
out
of
the
body
returned
veronica
guardedly
barbara
did
not
crave
for
spiritual
excursions
and
secretly
preferred
the
old
days
when
her
chum
talked
tennis
instead
of
psychology
but
the
occult
was
paramount
and
she
was
obliged
to
follow
the
fashion
the
atmosphere
of
the
grange
was
certainly
conducive
to
superstition
the
dim
passages
and
panelled
walls
looked
haunted
every
accessory
of
the
old
mansion
seemed
a
suitable
background
for
a
ghost
the
juniors
were
frankly
frightened
they
did
not
dare
to
go
upstairs
alone
they
imagined
skeleton
fingers
clutching
their
legs
through
the
banisters
or
bodiless
heads
rolling
like
billiard
balls
along
the
landings
having
listened
awestruck
to
veronica
accounts
of
a
s√©ance
they
were
apprehensive
lest
the
tables
should
turn
sportive
and
caper
about
the
rooms
rapping
out
spirit
messages
or
boisterous
elementals
should
bump
the
beds
up
and
down
and
fling
the
china
about
that
only
happens
if
there
a
powerful
medium
in
the
house
veronica
had
assured
them
and
the
girls
devoutly
hoped
that
none
of
their
number
possessed
the
required
mystic
properties
look
here
said
raymonde
one
day
to
ardiune
i
getting
rather
fed
up
with
this
spook
business
so
i
agreed
ardiune
i
thought
it
was
fun
at
first
but
it
got
beyond
the
limit
now
the
sillies
can
talk
of
nothing
else
i
sick
of
sitting
on
veronica
bed
and
hearing
about
mediums
and
messages
i
like
a
potato
race
for
a
change
i
vote
we
get
up
some
progressive
games
it
would
be
more
jinky
i
fancy
a
good
many
are
tired
of
ghosts
only
they
do
like
to
say
so
ardiune
i
got
an
idea
while
the
school
still
mad
on
these
things
why
should
we
have
some
fun
out
of
it
play
a
rag
on
them
you
know
dress
up
in
a
sheet
and
rub
wet
matches
on
one
hands
suggested
ardiune
illustration
the
passage
was
very
dark
but
morvyth
had
brought
her
electric
torch
no
no
nothing
so
stale
as
that
why
it
would
hardly
take
in
the
juniors
for
more
than
a
minute
i
angling
for
bigger
fish
i
want
to
hook
the
sixth
h
not
so
easy
my
good
girl
it
needs
craft
of
course
and
one
must
have
a
suitable
bait
the
common
or
garden
ghost
trick
would
be
useless
i
want
something
subtle
if
i
could
have
developed
mediumistic
powers
now
and
gone
into
a
trance
could
you
queried
ardiune
eagerly
raymonde
shook
a
regretful
head
veronica
knows
too
much
about
s√©ances
she
says
the
great
test
of
the
trance
is
to
stick
pins
into
the
medium
if
she
does
utter
a
groan
then
her
conscious
entity
is
suspended
and
a
spirit
is
about
to
materialize
i
could
stand
being
a
living
i
know
squeal
but
we
might
pad
you
with
cushions
s√©ances
are
always
held
in
the
dark
so
they
would
find
out
trust
veronica
to
find
my
vulnerable
spot
she
detests
me
and
just
enjoy
prodding
me
up
with
pins
no
we
must
have
something
less
painful
than
that
please
might
be
possible
the
sixth
did
it
and
the
table
was
beginning
to
go
round
quite
nicely
when
they
discovered
that
linda
was
pushing
the
leg
i
think
pretty
nearly
everything
occult
has
been
tried
here
lately
except
just
one
we
not
had
any
crystal
gazing
how
do
that
do
you
remember
that
chapter
in
the
sahara
how
she
goes
to
the
coptic
magician
and
he
pours
some
ink
into
a
little
hand
and
sees
all
her
future
in
it
ink
would
stain
horribly
commented
ardiune
yes
i
do
mean
to
use
ink
what
i
want
is
a
crystal
something
on
gibbie
that
would
do
jolly
well
i
believe
i
borrow
it
i
know
just
how
to
manage
because
mabel
and
sylvia
went
to
consult
a
psychist
in
bond
street
and
they
told
me
all
about
it
and
everything
she
said
and
did
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
described
mabel
fianc√©
quite
wrong
and
pretended
she
saw
him
sitting
in
a
while
all
the
time
he
was
on
a
battleship
but
they
thought
it
great
fun
because
they
had
really
intended
to
believe
her
would
the
girls
believe
you
certainly
not
as
raymonde
armitage
i
do
mean
them
to
know
me
we
going
to
disguise
ourselves
so
that
our
very
mothers
own
us
whew
ardiune
looked
decidedly
sceptical
wait
till
i
done
telling
you
before
you
pull
faces
you
old
bluebottle
ca
you
trust
me
by
now
to
get
up
a
decent
rag
yes
offended
all
right
i
accept
apologies
now
if
you
really
listening
i
explain
you
know
the
gipsies
are
camping
down
by
the
river
everybody
in
the
school
has
noticed
their
caravans
and
realizes
they
there
now
what
more
natural
than
for
a
couple
of
these
gipsies
to
stroll
round
by
the
barn
some
evening
during
recreation
time
and
offer
to
predict
the
future
katherine
and
ave
could
be
in
the
secret
have
their
fortunes
told
first
and
then
bring
others
we
install
ourselves
in
the
old
it
so
dark
no
one
would
see
us
very
plainly
ray
you
enough
imagination
for
a
novelist
murmured
ardiune
admiringly
having
settled
their
plan
of
campaign
the
next
step
was
to
carry
out
details
the
question
of
costume
loomed
largest
we
must
look
real
gipsies
not
stage
ones
decreed
raymonde
the
thing
got
to
be
done
properly
if
it
done
at
all
they
ransacked
the
property
box
used
for
school
theatricals
and
having
selected
some
likely
garments
set
to
work
on
an
ideal
of
realism
two
skirts
were
carefully
torn
on
nails
artistically
stained
with
rust
and
mud
and
rubbed
on
the
barn
floor
to
give
them
an
extra
tone
some
cotton
bodices
were
similarly
treated
shoes
were
a
knotty
problem
for
gipsies
do
not
generally
affect
trim
footgear
yet
nobody
at
the
grange
possessed
or
dilapidated
boots
in
the
end
raymonde
carefully
unpicked
the
stitches
in
her
oldest
pairs
to
give
them
the
requisite
burst
appearance
and
with
the
aid
of
a
file
rubbed
the
respectability
from
them
a
dip
in
the
mud
of
the
moat
completed
the
transformation
some
cheap
beads
and
coloured
handkerchiefs
and
a
faint
wash
of
vandyke
brown
over
face
and
hands
gave
the
finishing
touches
in
the
interval
between
preparation
and
supper
when
several
members
of
the
sixth
form
were
pursuing
carpentry
and
other
industrial
occupations
in
the
barn
aveline
kerby
entered
to
borrow
a
she
conversed
casually
on
the
topics
of
photography
pressed
flowers
and
kindred
hobbies
then
just
as
she
was
leaving
turned
back
and
remarked
apparently
as
an
afterthought
oh
by
the
by
do
you
know
there
are
two
gipsies
in
the
they
from
the
caravan
by
the
river
they
came
in
through
the
back
gate
begging
and
morvyth
happened
to
meet
them
they
offered
to
tell
her
fortune
so
she
took
them
into
the
so
that
gibbie
should
see
them
she
says
they
marvellous
they
described
her
mother
exactly
and
her
brother
at
the
front
is
it
wonderful
now
they
can
do
it
are
they
there
still
asked
veronica
swallowing
the
bait
i
believe
so
at
least
they
were
five
minutes
ago
elsie
moseley
and
cynthia
greene
had
gone
to
see
them
i
go
myself
but
i
spent
all
my
allowance
and
of
course
one
has
to
cross
their
palms
with
the
orthodox
piece
of
silver
i
suppose
it
hard
luck
to
be
thanks
for
the
aveline
beat
a
judicious
retreat
and
left
her
words
to
work
as
she
had
expected
the
news
of
the
arrival
of
the
occultists
was
received
with
interest
it
an
extraordinary
thing
that
gipsies
are
so
often
gifted
with
psychic
powers
commented
meta
they
children
of
nature
returned
veronica
i
suppose
our
blunts
our
astral
perceptions
one
finds
marvellous
things
among
the
hill
tribes
in
india
things
that
ca
be
explained
by
any
known
rules
of
science
i
suppose
these
ancient
races
have
inherited
secrets
that
we
grasp
yes
they
follow
forgotten
laws
of
nature
some
day
no
doubt
science
will
rediscover
them
veronica
spoke
seriously
during
the
holidays
she
had
studied
the
subject
by
the
aid
of
books
borrowed
from
the
free
library
i
should
like
just
to
go
and
have
a
look
at
these
gipsies
she
added
will
you
come
with
me
she
voiced
the
feelings
of
the
others
they
rose
with
one
accord
and
went
in
the
direction
of
the
they
met
cynthia
greene
and
elsie
moseley
coming
out
at
the
sight
of
monitresses
they
dived
round
the
corner
of
the
building
and
escaped
into
the
orchard
it
certainly
our
duty
to
investigate
propounded
meta
it
is
pleasant
when
duty
and
inclination
coincide
the
girls
walked
forward
briskly
the
interior
of
the
was
dark
as
an
eastern
temple
the
gipsies
had
established
themselves
in
the
dimmest
corner
and
were
squatting
on
bundles
of
straw
under
a
manger
obviously
they
were
extremely
dirty
and
dilapidated
their
hands
and
faces
appeared
to
be
unacquainted
with
soap
and
water
their
clothes
were
tattered
their
shoes
seemingly
in
the
last
stage
of
decrepitude
tell
your
fortunes
my
pretty
ladies
pattered
one
of
the
romanys
her
voice
was
hoarse
but
conciliatory
possibly
she
had
a
cold
tents
are
notoriously
draughty
we
do
care
about
vulgar
fortunes
we
are
really
interested
commenced
veronica
what
we
like
to
know
is
how
you
get
your
powers
where
does
your
knowledge
of
the
future
come
from
i
always
wanted
to
ask
this
the
gipsy
woman
shook
her
head
pityingly
ah
lady
we
do
know
ourselves
it
comes
to
us
suddenly
like
a
flash
of
light
we
see
your
future
then
it
fades
it
a
sixth
sense
that
given
to
the
poor
gipsies
they
born
with
it
and
they
explain
it
any
more
than
you
can
explain
the
breath
of
your
body
i
often
heard
of
this
sixth
sense
whispered
daphne
to
lois
sometimes
we
feel
what
going
to
be
and
sometimes
we
see
it
continued
the
gipsy
fumbling
with
something
in
her
lap
we
tell
beforehand
which
way
the
knowledge
will
come
what
that
you
got
there
asked
veronica
sharply
is
it
a
crystal
you
right
lady
it
is
a
crystal
and
a
wonderful
one
too
my
grandmother
got
it
from
but
no
i
best
not
be
telling
that
i
would
part
with
it
lady
if
the
queen
offered
me
her
crown
in
exchange
take
it
in
your
hand
look
how
it
sparkles
it
does
often
shine
like
that
only
when
someone
with
the
sixth
sense
holds
it
i
sometimes
suspected
that
i
possess
psychic
powers
murmured
veronica
complacently
would
you
like
to
learn
the
future
lady
queried
the
gipsy
then
hold
it
so
in
your
hands
for
a
minute
now
it
has
felt
you
and
known
you
and
it
will
tell
oh
yes
it
will
tell
she
took
the
crystal
again
and
turned
to
the
companion
who
squatted
beside
her
on
the
floor
zara
look
what
is
coming
to
the
lady
she
commanded
softly
zara
who
had
apparently
been
in
a
deep
reverie
roused
herself
with
a
start
placed
the
crystal
in
her
lap
with
the
first
finger
and
the
thumb
of
each
hand
lightly
touching
it
and
stared
fixedly
into
the
magic
glass
for
a
moment
or
two
the
future
seemed
obscured
then
evidently
it
cleared
she
began
to
speak
in
a
deep
monotonous
voice
as
if
talking
in
her
sleep
i
see
the
sea
waves
waves
everywhere
there
is
a
ship
oh
it
has
changed
i
see
sand
and
a
white
house
and
palm
trees
a
soldier
in
khaki
is
coming
out
of
the
house
he
stops
to
speak
to
a
servant
a
black
man
in
a
turban
he
is
angry
he
frowns
he
goes
again
into
the
white
house
oh
it
is
fading
it
is
gone
my
brother
leslie
in
egypt
gasped
veronica
much
impressed
she
would
have
requested
a
continuance
of
the
vision
but
at
that
moment
the
clanged
loudly
it
was
plainly
time
to
go
and
tidy
up
for
supper
if
you
could
come
again
about
five
she
suggested
pressing
a
coin
into
the
gipsy
ready
hand
yes
lady
if
we
still
in
the
neighbourhood
we
never
know
when
we
be
moving
on
you
see
but
we
try
to
oblige
you
if
we
can
raymonde
and
ardiune
toilets
that
evening
would
have
done
credit
to
variety
artistes
with
clean
faces
and
hands
and
their
dresses
at
least
half
fastened
they
slipped
into
their
places
at
the
just
in
time
a
little
flurried
perhaps
but
preserving
an
outward
calm
so
far
their
scheme
had
succeeded
admirably
the
sixth
appeared
to
have
no
suspicions
they
repeated
their
performance
on
the
following
day
installing
themselves
in
the
and
receiving
relays
of
enquirers
who
came
to
consult
them
as
to
their
future
knowing
somewhat
of
the
private
history
of
each
member
of
the
school
they
got
on
excellently
and
their
reputation
spread
till
more
than
half
the
girls
had
paid
surreptitious
visits
to
their
retreat
all
might
have
gone
well
and
their
secret
might
have
remained
undiscovered
had
it
not
been
for
veronica
friendship
with
mademoiselle
veronica
was
so
impressed
with
the
value
of
the
crystal
information
that
she
could
not
help
confiding
the
news
and
bringing
the
impressionable
belgian
to
consult
the
seer
for
herself
ardiune
visions
of
smoking
ruins
and
rescued
refugees
left
mademoiselle
almost
speechless
she
in
her
turn
felt
impelled
to
seek
a
confidante
and
imparted
the
wonderful
revelations
to
miss
gibbs
that
worthy
lady
immediately
set
off
for
the
as
she
entered
there
was
a
scuttling
of
juniors
who
sought
safety
behind
the
partition
raymonde
stared
for
a
moment
aghast
then
whispered
to
ardiune
bluff
it
out
miss
gibbs
proceeded
in
an
absolutely
manner
she
requested
a
consultation
and
listened
while
the
gipsy
decidedly
nervous
gave
a
rambling
description
of
a
dark
gentleman
and
an
indian
temple
thank
you
she
said
at
last
i
think
it
only
fair
to
warn
you
that
you
can
be
prosecuted
and
fined
pounds
for
telling
fortunes
i
should
like
to
know
where
you
got
that
crystal
remarkably
like
the
ball
of
glass
that
was
broken
off
my
venetian
vase
i
missed
it
yesterday
from
my
mantelpiece
by
the
by
stooping
down
suddenly
and
pulling
aside
the
handkerchief
from
zara
swarthy
neck
you
are
wearing
a
locket
and
chain
that
i
know
to
be
the
property
of
one
of
my
pupils
it
is
my
duty
immediately
to
put
you
in
the
hands
of
the
police
the
game
was
up
the
disconcerted
gipsies
rose
from
their
alcove
and
came
back
from
the
psychic
to
the
material
world
it
was
a
hard
exacting
unsympathetic
world
as
mirrored
in
miss
gibbs
keen
grey
eyes
she
told
them
briefly
to
go
and
wash
their
faces
and
change
their
attire
then
to
report
themselves
in
the
where
she
would
be
at
work
correcting
exercises
you
can
bring
with
you
the
money
that
you
have
collected
over
this
business
she
added
half
an
hour
later
two
clean
tidy
but
dejected
pupils
entered
the
and
placed
the
sum
of
thirteen
and
ninepence
upon
her
desk
miss
gibbs
counted
it
over
scrupulously
any
girls
who
were
foolish
enough
to
give
you
this
deserve
to
lose
it
she
remarked
and
i
shall
send
it
as
a
contribution
to
the
red
cross
fund
you
will
each
learn
two
pages
of
curtis
by
heart
and
repeat
them
to
me
after
morning
school
i
may
mention
that
i
consider
it
a
great
liberty
for
any
girl
to
enter
my
bedroom
and
remove
ornaments
from
my
mantelpiece
that
evening
after
preparation
and
supper
the
entire
school
instead
of
being
allowed
to
pursue
fancy
work
was
summoned
to
the
lecture
hall
and
harangued
by
miss
beasley
upon
the
follies
and
dangers
of
superstition
she
touched
upon
ancient
beliefs
in
witchcraft
and
modern
credulity
in
clairvoyance
and
spiritualism
and
placed
an
equal
ban
upon
both
in
these
enlightened
times
with
all
the
advantages
of
education
to
dispel
ignorance
she
concluded
it
is
incredible
to
me
that
anybody
can
still
be
found
ready
to
believe
in
such
nonsense
i
beg
you
all
and
especially
those
elder
girls
who
should
be
leaders
of
the
rest
to
turn
your
thoughts
and
conversation
to
some
healthier
topic
and
to
let
these
morbid
fancies
sink
into
the
obscurity
they
deserve
it
was
a
nasty
hit
for
the
monitresses
whispered
ardiune
to
raymonde
afterwards
did
you
see
veronica
turning
as
red
as
beetroot
we
have
to
wake
early
morning
and
swat
at
those
wretched
dates
it
was
grizzly
bad
luck
gibbie
found
us
out
but
on
the
whole
the
game
was
worth
the
candle
proclaimed
raymonde
unrepentantly
chapter
viii
the
beano
after
the
events
related
in
the
last
chapter
the
monitresses
suddenly
awakened
to
a
sense
of
their
responsibility
as
leaders
of
the
school
particularly
veronica
she
had
a
sensitive
disposition
and
miss
beasley
reproof
rankled
she
determined
to
set
an
example
to
the
younger
ones
and
to
be
zealous
in
keeping
order
and
enforcing
rules
she
held
a
surprise
inspection
of
the
juniors
desks
and
drawers
and
pounced
upon
illicit
packets
of
chocolate
she
examined
their
books
and
confiscated
any
which
she
considered
unsuitable
she
put
a
ban
upon
slang
and
wrote
out
a
new
set
of
dormitory
regulations
her
efforts
were
hardly
so
much
appreciated
as
they
deserved
the
girls
grumbled
at
this
unanticipated
tightening
of
the
reins
we
always
bought
sweets
and
kept
them
in
our
desks
declared
joan
butler
i
believe
veronica
used
to
do
it
herself
life
would
be
worth
living
without
chocolates
mourned
nora
fawcitt
and
we
always
used
to
scramble
for
the
bathroom
in
the
mornings
ever
since
i
been
here
groused
dorothy
newstead
it
no
fun
to
wait
in
a
queue
the
fifth
fared
no
better
than
the
fourth
and
being
older
their
indignation
was
even
hotter
veronica
took
away
and
said
it
was
fumed
aveline
she
told
me
i
might
read
scott
and
dickens
instead
and
just
got
to
the
interesting
part
it
too
idiotic
i
ca
see
why
veronica
need
act
censor
to
all
our
reading
agreed
katherine
bitterly
why
should
we
be
allowed
jane
austen
and
not
charlotte
bront√´
little
girls
must
read
love
stories
mocked
raymonde
but
they
all
love
stories
scott
and
dickens
and
jane
and
everyone
how
about
shakespeare
there
heaps
of
in
and
and
we
took
that
with
professor
marshall
i
do
think
gibbie
ever
quite
approved
of
it
she
thought
it
indiscreet
of
the
professor
i
sure
and
likely
to
put
ideas
into
our
heads
does
she
expect
we
go
eloping
over
the
garden
wall
perhaps
why
she
keeps
such
a
vigilant
with
the
telescope
it
quite
bad
enough
to
have
gibbie
always
on
our
trail
said
ardiune
gloomily
but
when
it
comes
to
veronica
turning
as
well
i
call
it
an
outrage
i
think
girls
have
responsibilities
as
well
as
monitresses
grunted
raymonde
it
not
good
for
veronica
to
take
life
so
earnestly
she
grow
old
before
her
time
the
always
rubbing
it
into
us
to
make
the
most
of
our
girlhood
and
not
be
little
premature
women
so
i
vote
we
live
up
to
her
theory
veronica
last
term
here
she
ought
to
be
bubbling
and
girlish
and
carry
away
happy
memories
of
her
when
she
goes
out
into
the
wide
world
to
be
a
woman
i
consider
it
our
duty
to
look
after
this
the
bumble
says
the
value
of
school
life
consists
in
its
and
take
we
taking
a
good
deal
from
veronica
at
present
so
we
must
give
her
something
back
let
teach
her
to
be
kittenish
and
playful
the
chums
exploded
the
idea
of
the
veronica
developing
a
bubbling
or
kittenish
manner
was
too
much
for
them
we
did
pretty
well
when
we
took
maudie
heywood
in
hand
urged
raymonde
she
wonderfully
improved
never
exceeds
the
speed
limit
in
her
lessons
and
if
she
writes
extra
essays
she
keeps
them
to
herself
and
does
flaunt
them
before
the
form
and
there
was
cynthia
greene
too
we
do
hear
a
word
about
the
poplars
now
or
her
wretched
bracelet
it
may
be
difficult
perhaps
but
we
do
our
best
with
veronica
we
must
regard
ourselves
as
sort
of
missionaries
having
decided
that
it
was
their
vocation
to
cultivate
a
spirit
of
artless
happiness
in
the
school
the
mystic
seven
set
to
work
on
veronica
she
did
not
respond
to
their
efforts
on
the
contrary
she
seemed
to
resent
them
when
they
attempted
to
introduce
lighter
veins
of
conversation
she
reproached
them
with
being
frivolous
she
frowned
on
riddles
limericks
and
puns
one
day
she
so
far
forgot
herself
as
to
murmur
cheeky
kids
raymonde
with
a
shocked
and
grieved
expression
looked
at
the
illuminated
card
deprecating
the
use
of
slang
which
had
lately
been
hung
in
the
lecture
hall
and
veronica
flounced
out
of
the
room
that
night
when
the
monitress
went
to
bed
her
sponge
and
cake
of
soap
were
missing
and
it
was
only
after
a
long
search
that
she
found
them
at
the
bottom
of
her
emptied
on
the
next
evening
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
strike
a
light
owing
to
the
fact
that
both
her
candle
and
matches
had
been
carefully
soaked
beforehand
in
water
veronica
felt
it
was
high
time
to
lay
the
matter
before
her
they
decided
that
such
flagrant
cases
of
insubordination
must
be
promptly
dealt
with
in
order
to
catch
the
offenders
they
laid
a
trap
linda
and
daphne
concealing
themselves
in
veronica
bedroom
while
veronica
herself
walked
ostentatiously
in
the
courtyard
as
they
had
expected
it
was
not
long
before
two
stealthy
figures
came
tiptoeing
in
and
were
taken
in
the
very
act
of
constructing
an
bed
the
vials
of
wrath
which
descended
upon
the
practical
jokers
were
enough
to
damp
the
spirits
of
even
such
madcaps
as
raymonde
and
aveline
after
all
monitresses
are
monitresses
and
to
affront
them
is
rather
like
twisting
a
tail
miss
gibbs
herself
could
not
have
been
more
scathing
in
her
sarcasms
than
linda
for
once
the
mystics
retired
crushed
and
with
a
due
respect
for
their
seniors
it
was
not
in
the
nature
of
things
however
for
raymonde
spirits
to
remain
long
below
zero
after
a
decent
period
of
immersion
they
once
more
rose
to
the
surface
the
occasion
of
their
revival
was
sufficient
to
awaken
enthusiasm
in
the
most
and
of
a
report
was
rumoured
through
the
grange
nobody
seemed
to
know
quite
where
it
started
or
what
was
the
fount
of
information
but
everybody
said
it
was
perfectly
true
and
girl
whispered
to
girl
the
astounding
secret
the
bumble
and
the
wasp
are
going
out
to
dinner
on
thursday
and
are
to
stay
the
night
only
we
not
supposed
to
get
a
hint
of
it
so
do
breathe
a
word
or
let
on
you
heard
circumstantial
evidence
seemed
to
confirm
the
statement
emily
the
had
been
seen
in
the
employed
on
some
renovations
to
miss
beasley
best
evening
dress
miss
had
been
brought
down
from
the
to
have
its
lock
and
handles
polished
and
dorothy
newstead
concealed
behind
a
laurel
bush
during
a
game
of
had
overheard
the
principal
give
instructions
to
the
gardener
to
order
a
conveyance
for
thursday
evening
at
six
certainly
nothing
could
be
more
conclusive
excitement
was
rife
never
in
all
the
annals
of
the
school
had
miss
beasley
and
miss
gibbs
together
taken
a
night
off
it
seems
a
shame
to
waste
such
a
golden
opportunity
said
raymonde
enthusiastically
gibbie
was
talking
to
us
only
about
seizing
our
opportunities
ye
rosebuds
while
ye
may
old
time
is
still
and
this
same
flower
that
smiles
will
be
dying
she
quoted
it
most
impressively
she
did
go
on
to
the
verse
about
getting
married
while
you
the
chance
though
chuckled
ardiune
no
my
child
such
a
subject
as
matrimony
is
not
supposed
to
be
a
fitting
topic
for
a
ladies
school
gibbie
always
gracefully
shelves
it
but
you
and
i
want
to
get
back
to
my
point
i
was
talking
of
opportunities
and
never
in
the
whole
of
our
shall
we
get
such
another
as
next
thursday
how
are
we
going
to
make
use
of
it
i
vote
for
a
beano
in
our
dormitory
what
a
demanded
fauvette
plaintive
voice
always
saying
things
i
do
understand
you
young
child
returned
raymonde
indulgently
and
you
be
expected
to
know
everything
a
beano
is
a
now
look
alarmed
we
not
going
to
eat
beans
we
have
something
far
more
appetizing
sardines
and
tinned
peaches
and
biscuits
and
anything
else
we
can
get
if
the
bumble
and
the
wasp
gad
off
to
enjoy
themselves
why
should
we
make
a
night
of
it
too
how
about
those
kids
they
join
in
it
shall
be
an
affair
for
the
whole
dormitory
share
the
treat
for
once
you
wo
get
the
monitresses
to
join
interposed
katherine
dubiously
sha
ask
them
i
settled
all
that
in
my
mind
you
know
the
big
oak
door
across
the
passage
that
leads
to
their
rooms
well
i
going
to
fasten
it
after
they
gone
to
bed
and
lock
them
up
in
their
own
quarters
that
would
be
all
right
old
sport
if
there
were
a
key
but
there
is
morvyth
holmes
think
i
an
infant
i
know
perfectly
well
there
is
a
key
i
going
to
fix
a
screw
in
the
door
and
another
in
the
doorpost
beforehand
and
then
twist
some
strong
wire
across
act
like
a
lock
the
mystics
stared
at
their
leader
in
admiration
her
resourcefulness
knew
no
bounds
with
the
monitresses
safely
boxed
up
in
their
bedrooms
any
jinks
would
be
possible
in
the
dormitory
of
course
there
remained
mademoiselle
but
she
slept
at
the
other
side
of
the
house
and
from
past
experience
they
judged
that
she
was
more
likely
to
devote
the
evening
to
her
own
pleasure
than
to
an
attention
to
duty
the
juniors
when
sounded
on
the
subject
responded
to
a
girl
even
cynthia
greene
assented
gleefully
every
occupant
of
the
dormitory
vowed
with
a
solemn
oath
to
preserve
the
secret
at
all
costs
a
fund
was
opened
to
defray
expenses
how
to
get
the
provisions
was
the
main
difficulty
there
was
not
a
single
servant
in
the
establishment
whom
they
felt
was
absolutely
to
be
trusted
i
believe
even
that
new
little
lizzie
would
go
and
sneak
to
the
bumble
sighed
raymonde
we
shall
have
to
go
for
the
things
ourselves
there
nothing
else
for
it
who
volunteer
oh
not
all
of
you
we
ca
trot
off
in
a
body
look
here
i
go
with
morvyth
the
village
which
lay
half
a
mile
away
from
the
grange
was
out
of
bounds
it
would
be
an
extremely
risky
proceeding
for
two
girls
in
the
ordinary
brown
serge
uniform
and
conspicuous
hats
of
the
school
to
enter
a
shop
and
make
purchases
some
tiresome
busybody
would
be
sure
to
see
them
and
report
the
matter
to
miss
beasley
it
a
case
of
disguising
ourselves
decided
raymonde
the
maids
keep
their
waterproofs
and
hats
in
the
passage
near
the
kitchen
turn
up
our
hair
borrow
what
garments
we
want
and
dash
off
between
prep
and
supper
anyone
noticing
us
on
the
road
will
think
we
new
servants
from
some
house
in
the
neighbourhood
the
audacity
of
the
project
almost
staggered
morvyth
but
as
a
member
of
the
mystic
seven
she
was
pledged
to
follow
her
leader
and
would
not
for
worlds
have
displayed
symptoms
of
the
white
feather
though
her
more
cautious
soul
began
to
calculate
consequences
if
caught
there
were
so
many
pitfalls
in
the
path
servants
monitresses
and
mistresses
must
be
outwitted
both
in
going
and
returning
to
make
their
excursion
a
success
the
juniors
however
played
up
nobly
at
a
concerted
hour
they
managed
by
cleverly
concocted
excuses
to
engage
the
attention
of
all
the
monitresses
and
hold
them
busy
for
five
minutes
explaining
details
of
lessons
or
fancy
work
meantime
aveline
and
valentine
purloined
waterproofs
of
a
suitable
length
together
with
appropriate
hats
from
the
passage
near
the
kitchen
raymonde
and
morvyth
after
a
rapid
toilet
and
a
hasty
review
of
themselves
in
a
were
pleased
with
their
appearance
especially
the
way
they
wore
their
hats
tilt
yours
a
little
more
on
one
side
commanded
raymonde
and
open
your
mouth
with
a
sort
of
expression
as
if
you
got
adenoids
remember
you
want
to
look
as
common
as
possible
drop
your
h
when
you
speak
wherever
you
can
say
you
in
a
to
get
back
i
shall
sniff
all
the
time
as
if
i
a
bad
cold
i
shall
laugh
if
you
do
no
you
wo
because
we
going
to
different
shops
i
do
adcock
and
you
shall
have
seymour
it
be
far
better
than
going
together
under
cover
of
a
guard
of
the
conspirators
managed
to
slip
past
the
barns
and
off
the
premises
secure
in
the
knowledge
that
miss
gibbs
was
correcting
exercises
in
the
study
so
could
not
possibly
be
watching
them
through
her
too
useful
telescope
before
arriving
at
the
village
they
separated
raymonde
going
a
little
in
advance
and
morvyth
following
as
if
they
had
no
acquaintance
with
each
other
it
was
perhaps
as
well
for
their
mutual
composure
that
they
visited
separate
shops
for
morvyth
provincial
accent
and
raymonde
cold
might
have
been
to
a
fellow
conspirator
though
they
passed
muster
well
enough
with
strangers
at
the
end
of
ten
minutes
the
two
girls
were
hurrying
back
each
armed
with
a
large
parcel
these
were
handed
at
once
to
scouts
when
they
reached
the
grange
and
their
costumes
were
removed
in
the
barn
and
replaced
without
delay
on
their
hooks
in
the
kitchen
passage
by
valentine
and
ardiune
so
far
so
good
the
commissariat
department
had
managed
to
run
the
blockade
of
school
regulations
and
secure
provisions
for
the
entertainment
no
tommies
looting
supplies
from
the
enemy
trenches
could
have
felt
prouder
when
the
eventful
thursday
arrived
great
anxiety
was
felt
as
to
whether
the
principal
and
her
assistant
were
really
and
actually
going
out
or
not
they
did
not
announce
their
intention
and
gave
no
hint
of
the
matter
little
nancie
page
however
sent
to
miss
gibbs
room
with
a
message
reported
having
seen
that
lady
engaged
in
packing
her
which
was
taken
as
proof
conclusive
of
the
contemplated
expedition
we
be
subdued
saints
all
suggested
raymonde
talk
intelligently
to
the
monitresses
about
intellectual
subjects
the
deeper
the
better
make
them
think
we
going
to
bed
with
our
minds
fixed
on
egyptology
and
the
wonders
of
the
microscope
and
the
bagdad
railway
and
the
future
of
european
politics
be
sure
you
go
upstairs
very
quietly
anyone
who
laughs
will
give
the
show
away
the
behaviour
of
the
school
that
evening
was
a
subject
of
satisfaction
to
veronica
and
her
fellow
monitresses
i
was
afraid
remarked
the
head
girl
that
they
might
take
advantage
when
they
saw
miss
beasley
and
miss
gibbs
places
empty
at
supper
but
they
seemed
to
feel
on
their
honour
to
be
steadier
than
usual
i
really
think
their
tone
is
improving
raymonde
armitage
was
particularly
quiet
yes
returned
daphne
dubiously
so
she
was
but
if
raymonde
has
a
quiet
fit
like
that
on
i
generally
look
out
for
squalls
afterwards
when
mademoiselle
went
the
round
of
the
dormitory
that
night
at
she
found
absolute
peace
and
tranquillity
reigning
apparently
the
occupants
of
the
nineteen
beds
were
already
wrapt
in
repose
one
or
two
were
even
snoring
slightly
mademoiselle
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
and
went
off
thankfully
to
her
own
bedroom
to
write
letters
she
did
not
consider
it
necessary
to
interrupt
herself
at
this
occupation
miss
gibbs
had
indeed
urged
the
expediency
of
a
surprise
visit
at
about
but
mademoiselle
had
no
vocation
for
enforcing
discipline
and
was
not
with
conscientious
scruples
moreover
she
considered
that
if
her
principal
took
an
evening
off
she
might
be
licensed
to
do
the
same
the
conspirators
had
decided
not
to
begin
the
celebrations
too
early
with
heroic
they
remained
quietly
in
bed
until
by
that
hour
monitresses
and
servants
alike
would
probably
be
asleep
mademoiselle
at
the
far
end
of
the
house
on
the
other
side
of
the
big
staircase
would
hear
nothing
when
the
charmed
moment
arrived
everybody
sprang
up
and
lighted
candles
raymonde
hurried
into
pink
and
bedroom
slippers
and
crept
up
the
passage
to
the
door
which
led
to
the
monitresses
rooms
she
had
inserted
her
screws
earlier
in
the
evening
so
with
the
aid
of
a
pair
of
pliers
purloined
from
the
bench
it
did
not
take
her
long
to
fix
her
wire
and
secure
the
door
she
came
back
chuckling
if
they
should
hear
any
slight
sounds
of
revelry
and
try
to
come
upon
the
scenes
they
just
find
themselves
jolly
well
locked
in
she
remarked
with
gusto
perhaps
they
think
mademoiselle
done
it
suggested
ardiune
preparations
for
the
feast
were
proceeding
briskly
two
beds
pulled
into
the
middle
of
the
room
formed
the
table
and
on
these
the
comestibles
were
spread
forth
the
village
shops
had
not
offered
a
very
wide
range
of
dainties
but
there
were
sardines
and
canned
peaches
and
biscuits
and
three
huntley
palmer
cakes
rather
dry
because
they
had
been
kept
in
a
tin
box
probably
since
last
christmas
the
drinkable
was
lemon
kali
served
in
bedroom
tumblers
and
stirred
up
with
or
handles
everybody
was
busy
morvyth
and
valentine
were
opening
the
tins
with
implements
ardiune
was
performing
an
abstruse
arithmetical
calculation
as
to
how
to
cut
up
three
cakes
into
nineteen
exactly
even
portions
while
katherine
waited
with
the
penknife
ready
even
the
hitherto
irreproachable
maudie
heywood
and
cynthia
greene
were
occupied
with
scissors
making
plates
out
of
sheets
of
exercise
paper
beds
drawn
up
alongside
the
impromptu
table
served
for
seats
and
the
girls
crowded
together
as
closely
as
they
could
raymonde
and
morvyth
by
virtue
of
their
expedition
to
the
shops
were
voted
mistresses
of
the
ceremonies
and
dispensed
the
provisions
sardines
on
biscuits
were
the
first
course
followed
by
canned
peaches
the
juiciness
of
which
was
a
decided
difficulty
as
there
was
not
a
solitary
spoon
with
which
to
fish
them
up
from
the
tin
never
mind
i
spear
them
with
a
and
stick
them
on
biscuits
and
you
must
drink
the
syrup
in
the
glasses
i
dare
say
it
mix
all
right
with
lemon
kali
purred
raymonde
thoroughly
in
her
element
as
hostess
the
fun
waxed
furious
and
it
only
increased
when
the
sardine
tin
upset
in
the
middle
of
one
of
the
temporary
tables
but
it
my
bed
wailed

up
someone
got
to
make
a
sacrifice
for
the
good
of
the
assembly
and
you
see
the
lot
fallen
on
you
said
raymonde
consolingly
you
ought
to
be
proud
to
have
your
bed
chosen
i
just
as
soon
it
had
been
yours
grumbled
cynthia
i
sha
like
sleeping
in
a
puddle
of
oil
if
you
grouse
any
more
i
empty
the
can
of
peaches
on
your
pillow
so
shut
up
commanded
the
mistress
of
the
ceremonies
a
beano
a
beano
and
we
going
to
enjoy
ourselves
if
we
make
too
much
noise
though
suggested
maudie
heywood
ardiune
snapped
her
up
promptly
we
make
what
noise
we
like
what
does
it
matter
the
monitresses
are
locked
out
and
mademoiselle
will
never
hear
we
got
the
place
to
ourselves
thank
goodness
just
for
once
mother
room
down
there
is
vacant
empty
is
the
cradle
baby
gone
mocked
morvyth
she
having
the
time
of
her
life
at
the
well
we
have
ours
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
the
dormitory
presented
a
convivial
scene
an
orchestra
of
five
seated
on
a
hastily
cleared
were
performing
music
with
combs
while
the
rest
of
the
company
waltzed
between
the
beds
with
intervals
of
the
maudie
heywood
and
cynthia
greene
had
accepted
the
inevitable
and
joined
the
multitude
apparently
they
were
enjoying
themselves
maudie
cheeks
were
scarlet
and
cynthia
long
fair
hair
floated
out
picturesquely
as
she
twirled
round
in
elsie
moseley
arms
we
certainly
making
the
most
of
our
bubbling
girlhood
murmured
raymonde
with
satisfaction
the
bumble
could
call
us
little
premature
women
the
dark
curtains
swayed
in
the
night
breeze
and
the
candles
flared
and
guttered
the
musicians
tootled
at
their
covered
combs
with
tingling
lips
faster
and
faster
whirled
the
dancers
the
fun
was
at
its
zenith
when
quite
suddenly
the
unexpected
happened
the
door
of
miss
gibbs
room
opened
and
that
grim
lady
herself
stood
on
the
threshold
if
a
spectre
had
made
its
appearance
in
their
midst
the
girls
could
not
have
been
more
disconcerted
a
horrible
hush
spread
over
the
room
and
for
a
moment
everybody
stared
in
frozen
horror
the
musicians
slipped
down
from
the
and
scuttled
towards
their
own
beds
h
so
this
is
how
you
are
to
be
trusted
remarked
miss
gibbs
tartly
advancing
towards
the
scene
of
the
beano
and
hastily
casting
an
eye
over
the
empty
tins
and
crumby
remains
of
the
repast
move
this
rubbish
away
and
push
those
beds
back
to
their
places
now
get
into
bed
every
one
of
you
not
a
single
sound
more
is
to
be
heard
we
settle
up
this
matter
having
seen
each
occupant
of
the
dormitory
ensconced
between
her
sheets
cynthia
did
not
dare
to
complain
that
hers
were
sardiny
miss
gibbs
went
back
to
her
own
room
leaving
the
door
wide
open
with
an
enraged
dragon
in
such
close
vicinity
the
girls
did
not
venture
to
stir
and
silence
reigned
for
the
rest
of
the
night
at
the
first
coming
of
the
dawn
however
raymonde
rose
with
infinite
precaution
and
stole
barefoot
along
the
passage
to
remove
her
wire
and
screws
from
the
oak
door
she
accomplished
that
task
without
discovery
and
after
hiding
the
behind
a
wardrobe
crept
back
to
bed
nineteen
subdued
penitents
clothed
in
mental
sackcloth
and
ashes
went
down
to
breakfast
next
morning
their
fears
were
not
without
foundation
for
when
miss
beasley
returned
at
ten
they
were
summoned
to
the
most
unpleasant
interview
they
ever
remembered
from
which
the
more
of
them
emerged
sobbing
they
spent
saturday
afternoon
in
the
schoolroom
writing
punishment
tasks
while
the
monitresses
went
boating
on
the
river
it
was
trying
to
see
daphne
and
hermie
coming
downstairs
in
their
nice
white
dresses
and
blue
ties
and
to
know
that
they
themselves
were
debarred
the
excursion
they
hung
about
the
hall
sulkily
it
your
own
faults
moralized
veronica
after
that
disgraceful
business
on
thursday
you
could
expect
anything
else
we
heard
you
plainly
enough
and
we
were
utterly
disgusted
i
like
to
know
who
locked
that
passage
door
i
have
my
suspicions
with
an
eye
on
raymonde
the
babyish
innocence
of
raymonde
face
at
that
moment
might
have
served
an
artist
as
a
model
for
a
child
angel
have
you
it
a
pity
to
harbour
suspicion
she
returned
sweetly
we
ought
to
learn
to
trust
our
schoolfellows
i
loathe

she
added
in
a
whisper
to
ardiune
as
the
monitress
tripped
cheerily
to
the
door
chapter
ix
a
week
on
the
land
the
vacations
at
the
grange
were
arranged
in
rather
an
unusual
fashion
a
full
week
holiday
being
given
at
whitsuntide
instead
of
the
ordinary
little
break
at
this
year
miss
gibbs
who
was
nothing
if
not
patriotic
evolved
a
plan
for
the
benefit
of
her
country
she
saw
an
advertisement
in
the
local
newspaper
stating
that
volunteers
would
soon
be
urgently
needed
to
gather
the
strawberry
crop
upon
a
farm
about
fifteen
miles
away
and
begging
ladies
of
education
to
lend
their
services
such
a
splendid
opportunity
of
war
work
appealed
to
her
she
wrote
at
once
for
particulars
and
after
some
correspondence
and
a
visit
to
the
scene
of
action
announced
her
scheme
to
the
school
she
proposed
that
any
girls
who
cared
to
devote
their
holidays
to
a
useful
end
should
join
a
camp
of
who
were
to
be
employed
on
the
farm
it
is
being
arranged
by
a
government
bureau
she
explained
and
many
people
will
be
coming
who
like
ourselves
want
to
help
to
bear
their
country
burdens
university
students
journalists
social
workers
hospital
nurses
matrons
of
institutions
and
mistresses
and
scholars
from
other
schools
we
shall
sleep
in
tents
and
lead
an
absolutely
outdoor
life
it
will
be
a
healthy
way
of
passing
a
week
as
well
as
a
benefit
to
the
nation
any
girl
who
would
like
to
do
her
share
may
give
me
her
name
this
afternoon
and
miss
beasley
will
write
to
her
parents
for
permission
for
her
to
join
the
camp
outside
in
the
quadrangle
the
school
talked
over
the
proposition
at
its
leisure
will
they
let
us
eat
the
strawberries
asked
fauvette
anxiously
certainly
you
little
glutton
snapped
veronica
you
be
allowed
to
stuff
till
you
loathe
the
very
thought
of
swallowing
a
strawberry
but
you
have
to
pick
hard
and
do
your
share
or
they
turn
you
off
the
monitresses
were
fired
with
the
idea
and
all
except
linda
had
decided
to
do
their
bit
their
enthusiasm
spread
downward
like
a
wave
before
the
day
was
over
eighteen
girls
had
given
in
their
names
as
volunteers
raymonde
morvyth
katherine
and
aveline
being
among
the
number
i
would
like
to
have
joined
you
really
protested
fauvette
only
i
know
i
be
so
dreadfully
all
the
rest
of
the
term
if
i
do
go
home
and
do
apologize
child
interrupted
raymonde
nobody
in
their
senses
expects
you
to
go
you
be
a
huge
embarrassment
to
the
rest
of
us
darlings
all
and
fluffy
hair
are
meant
for
hard
work
why
you
pick
about
six
strawberries
in
an
hour
and
eat
of
them
go
home
and
be
petted
by
all
means
we
do
want
you
weeping
yourself
to
sleep
at
night
it
disturbs
the
dormitory
the
country
survive
without
your
services
raymonde
mind
was
for
once
really
filled
with
a
wish
to
help
she
meant
to
do
her
full
share
of
work
also
she
was
determined
to
enjoy
herself
the
prospect
of
was
alluring
there
was
a
gipsy
smack
about
it
that
satisfied
her
unconventional
instincts
it
seemed
almost
next
door
to
campaigning
if
i
only
been
a
boy
i
have
run
away
to
the
front
long
ago
she
announced
girls
have
their
own
chances
in
life
as
well
as
boys
now
said
hermie
wait
till
you
finished
with
school
then
you
must
try
to
find
your
niche
in
the
world
there
plenty
of
pioneer
work
for
women
to
do
yet
they
have
half
exploited
the
colonies
once
we
show
we
some
good
on
the
land
why
should
the
government
start
us
in
farms
out
in
new
zealand
or
australia
it
ought
to
be
done
systematically
everything
been
so
haphazard
before
imagine
a
farm
all
run
by
girls
educated
at
our
best
secondary
and
public
schools
it
would
be
ideal
i
yearning
to
try
it
hermie
aspirations
towards
field
labour
and
a
colonial
future
had
been
greatly
spurred
on
lately
by
the
advent
of
some
lady
labourers
on
a
farm
near
the
grange
for
the
last
fortnight
the
milk
had
been
delivered
not
by
the
usual
uncouth
boy
but
by
a
charming
member
of
the
feminine
sex
attired
in
short
smock
knickers
and
gaiters
and
a
picturesque
rush
hat
hermie
had
entered
into
conversation
with
her
and
learned
that
she
was
a
clergyman
daughter
that
she
milked
six
cows
morning
and
evening
and
went
round
with
the
cart
delivering
the
milk
and
that
she
was
further
concerned
with
the
care
of
poultry
pigs
and
calves
the
glamour
of
her
experiences
made
hermie
wish
that
the
grange
were
full
of
pigs
instead
of
pupils
i
rather
attend
to
a
dozen
nice
little
black
berkshires
than
act
monitress
to
those
juniors
she
sighed
there
would
really
be
more
satisfaction
in
it
and
as
for
raymonde
armitage
and
her
set
give
me
young
calves
any
day
miss
gibbs
was
extremely
busy
making
preparations
for
the
expedition
the
farmer
undertook
to
provide
tents
for
the
party
and
bags
of
hay
to
sleep
upon
but
each
member
must
bring
her
own
pillow
blankets
mug
knife
fork
spoon
and
plate
as
well
as
her
personal
belongings
these
latter
were
whittled
down
to
the
smallest
capacity
for
there
would
be
little
room
to
stow
them
away
in
the
tents
stout
boots
waterproofs
and
hockey
caps
were
taken
in
case
the
weather
might
change
the
girls
wearing
their
usual
panama
school
hats
on
fine
days
in
order
to
prevent
difficulty
with
the
ordinary
they
were
to
be
paid
for
their
work
according
to
the
amount
accomplished
and
were
each
to
contribute
ten
shillings
towards
the
canteen
the
tents
being
provided
free
but
suppose
we
do
each
earn
ten
shillings
asked
daphne
the
cautious
whoever
does
will
have
to
make
up
the
balance
from
her
own
pocket
said
miss
gibbs
if
the
ordinary
pickers
can
pay
their
way
i
suppose
we
can
do
the
same
but
it
will
mean
sticking
at
it
hard
and
no
shirking
we
must
show
what
we
made
of
on
the
friday
before
whitsun
week
an
excited
little
party
of
eighteen
stood
with
bags
and
bundles
ready
to
start
miss
gibbs
bustling
round
them
like
a
fussy
hen
with
a
large
brood
of
chicks
giving
ever
so
many
last
directions
and
injunctions
which
seemed
rather
superfluous
as
she
was
going
with
them
and
would
have
them
under
her
charge
the
whole
time
they
went
by
rail
to
ledcombe
the
nearest
station
to
shipley
where
the
strawberry
gardens
were
situated
the
scene
on
the
platform
when
they
arrived
was
certainly
new
and
out
of
the
common
a
train
had
just
come
in
from
london
bringing
pickers
from
the
slums
it
was
labelled
strawberry
gatherers
only
and
its
cargo
was
lively
not
to
say
noisy
there
were
elderly
men
younger
ones
unfit
for
military
service
women
with
bawling
babies
girls
shouting
popular
songs
and
a
swarm
of
turbulent
children
whole
families
had
apparently
set
forth
to
spend
a
few
weeks
helping
at
the
fruit
harvest
combining
a
holiday
in
the
country
with
profit
to
their
pockets
we
not
going
among
that
crew
i
hope
said
daphne
staring
rather
aghast
at
the
unkempt
crowd
certainly
not
we
shall
have
our
own
quarters
returned
miss
gibbs
marshalling
her
flock
to
the
gate
of
exit
drawn
up
outside
the
station
were
six
large
hay
wagons
and
on
one
of
these
hung
a
placard
marlowe
grange
miss
gibbs
made
for
it
immediately
turning
out
some
struggling
slum
children
who
had
already
climbed
in
and
taken
temporary
possession
and
stowed
the
baggage
inside
there
plenty
of
room
for
us
all
she
announced
but
you
each
have
to
sit
on
your
own
bundle
i
glad
i
stipulated
that
they
should
reserve
us
a
wagon
for
ourselves
judging
by
the
rabble
who
were
swarming
on
to
the
other
hay
carts
the
girls
also
considered
it
a
cause
for
rejoicing
their
own
vehicle
started
first
and
began
to
jolt
slowly
down
the
country
road
its
occupants
sitting
as
steadily
as
they
could
on
their
knobbly
luggage
and
indulging
in
decidedly
feminine
squeals
when
as
often
happened
an
extra
hard
jog
threw
them
together
after
four
miles
of
this
rather
exciting
journey
they
reached
the
farm
their
driver
stopped
at
a
gate
and
pointing
across
a
field
to
some
tents
indicated
that
this
was
their
destination
he
could
take
them
no
nearer
and
they
must
convey
their
own
bags
and
bundles
over
the
pasture
hauling
their
own
luggage
with
them
was
no
light
task
and
they
were
heartily
tired
of
their
burdens
before
they
reached
the
tents
three
of
these
labelled
marlowe
grange
they
appropriated
then
miss
gibbs
after
a
brief
confabulation
with
the
canteen
matron
beckoned
to
her
flock
i
hear
we
must
go
at
once
and
secure
first
pick
of
the
hay
sacks
she
said
come
along
all
of
you
over
three
more
fields
and
two
stiles
they
came
to
the
farm
buildings
where
spread
out
on
hurdles
were
a
number
of
large
sacks
mercifully
clean
an
individual
in
charge
wearing
a
faded
blue
suit
and
a
two
days
growth
of
stubbly
beard
told
them
briefly
to
help
themselves
and
then
take
their
sacks
to
the
barn
and
fill
them
with
hay
preparing
their
own
mattresses
was
a
new
experience
but
an
amusing
one
it
was
fun
stuffing
the
hay
into
the
rough
canvas
bags
and
more
fun
still
carrying
the
bulky
bedding
back
over
fields
and
stiles
to
the
tents
here
amid
a
chaos
of
unpacking
they
at
last
disposed
their
belongings
to
their
satisfaction
their
special
little
colony
consisted
of
nine
tents
and
a
marquee
for
meals
it
was
in
charge
of
a
matron
who
directed
the
canteen
and
was
responsible
for
the
comfort
and
order
of
the
camp
in
each
tent
hung
a
list
of
rules
respecting
hours
of
rising
and
going
to
bed
meals
and
general
conduct
as
there
was
no
servant
except
the
cook
the
task
of
washing
up
must
be
shared
by
all
in
rotation
the
matron
having
authority
to
apportion
the
work
no
lights
or
talking
were
to
be
allowed
after
by
the
time
the
girls
had
settled
all
their
possessions
it
was
seven
and
the
rest
of
the
camp
returned
from
the
strawberry
fields
supper
was
served
in
the
marquee
everybody
sitting
on
benches
round
wooden
tables
without
cloths
the
company
proved
pleasant
and
congenial
there
were
fifty
in
all
including
some
students
from
ludminster
university
and
eight
girls
and
two
teachers
from
a
secondary
school
at
tadbury
the
slum
party
it
seemed
were
lodged
in
the
big
barns
behind
the
farm
while
some
caravans
of
gipsy
pickers
had
possession
of
a
corner
of
a
field
some
distance
away
supper
finished
most
of
the
workers
sat
about
and
rested
a
few
possessed
of
superfluous
energy
took
a
walk
to
the
village
a
mile
off
but
the
generality
were
very
tired
a
gramophone
in
the
marquee
blared
away
at
popular
songs
and
the
more
lively
spirits
joined
in
the
choruses
one
or
two
even
attempted
to
dance
on
the
grass
miss
gibbs
had
already
struck
up
a
friendship
with
a
lady
journalist
and
some
of
the
girls
began
to
make
overtures
to
the
tadbury
scholars
who
looked
rather
a
jolly
little
set
everybody
retired
early
as
they
would
have
to
be
up
at
and
in
the
fields
by
seven
the
marlowe
grange
contingent
were
much
exercised
as
to
the
best
way
to
place
their
mattresses
they
did
not
know
whether
to
sleep
with
their
heads
or
their
feet
to
the
and
finally
decided
in
favour
of
the
former
going
to
bed
was
a
funny
business
in
so
very
small
a
space
with
no
chairs
or
places
to
put
clothes
down
and
only
one
tin
basin
amongst
six
to
wash
in
it
was
funnier
still
when
they
attempted
to
lie
down
on
their
mattresses
a
bag
stuffed
with
hay
is
so
round
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
keep
upon
it
without
rolling
off
and
there
was
much
pommelling
and
flattening
before
the
beds
were
at
all
tenable
at
last
everyone
was
settled
the
lights
were
out
and
the
campers
rolled
in
their
blankets
tried
to
compose
themselves
to
sleep
raymonde
whose
billet
was
opposite
the
door
of
the
tent
could
see
out
and
watch
the
stars
shining
she
lay
awake
a
long
time
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
a
bright
planet
that
moved
across
the
little
horizon
of
sky
visible
to
her
till
it
passed
out
of
sight
and
at
length
she
too
slept
chapter
x
the
campers
life
began
at
the
camp
soon
after
when
the
more
energetic
spirits
tumbled
off
their
hay
sacks
flung
on
and
scrambled
for
turns
at
the
bath
tent
fetching
water
for
the
day
was
the
first
business
of
the
morning
and
those
on
bucket
duty
trotted
off
to
the
stream
two
fields
away
joking
and
making
fun
as
they
went
but
returning
more
soberly
with
the
heavy
pails
the
breakfast
tasted
delicious
after
their
early
outing
and
most
of
the
workers
seemed
in
good
spirits
by
seven
the
whole
party
were
down
in
the
gardens
the
marlowe
grange
girls
had
never
seen
strawberries
by
the
acre
before
and
they
were
amazed
almost
daunted
at
the
sight
of
the
vast
quantity
of
fruit
that
must
be
gathered
they
were
told
off
to
a
certain
portion
of
the
field
given
baskets
and
shown
where
to
bring
them
when
full
each
novice
for
the
first
day
was
expected
to
work
near
an
experienced
hand
who
could
show
her
what
was
required
as
the
picking
though
quick
must
be
careful
so
as
not
to
bruise
the
strawberries
raymonde
and
morvyth
found
themselves
under
the
wing
of
a
social
settlement
secretary
a
dame
who
had
picked
the
previous
summer
and
understood
the
swiftest
methods
close
by
they
could
hear
miss
gibbs
being
instructed
by
the
lady
journalist
with
whom
she
had
apparently
cemented
a
friendship
it
was
a
point
of
honour
to
fill
the
baskets
with
the
utmost
possible
speed
and
everybody
worked
steadily
there
was
no
rule
against
eating
the
fruit
but
the
pay
was
according
to
the
number
of
baskets
handed
in
so
that
shirkers
would
find
themselves
unable
to
earn
their
keep
it
was
a
rather
employment
but
otherwise
pleasant
for
the
day
was
fine
the
larks
were
singing
and
wild
roses
and
honeysuckle
bloomed
in
the
hedgerows
the
slum
pickers
at
the
other
side
of
the
field
toiled
away
with
practised
fingers
many
of
them
came
every
year
and
would
return
in
september
for
the
hop
harvest
the
small
children
played
under
the
hedge
and
took
charge
of
the
babies
who
cried
and
slept
alternately
poor
little
souls
without
receiving
much
attention
from
the
hardworking
mothers
the
slum
contingent
was
a
subject
of
much
amusement
and
curiosity
to
the
marlowe
grange
platoon
though
they
occupied
different
portions
of
the
field
they
would
meet
when
they
went
to
deliver
baskets
the
rollicking
good
nature
and
repartees
of
some
of
these
people
especially
of
the
gipsies
were
often
very
funny
they
would
chaff
the
agent
who
registered
their
scores
with
a
considerable
power
of
humour
and
the
grange
girls
waiting
in
line
for
their
turns
would
chuckle
as
they
overheard
the
conversations
at
eleven
everybody
ate
lunch
which
they
had
brought
with
them
then
worked
till
one
when
they
returned
to
the
camp
for
dinner
picking
went
on
again
from
two
till
six
with
an
interval
at
four
for
tea
which
was
brought
down
to
the
gardens
in
large
cans
and
poured
into
the
workers
own
mugs
it
was
almost
the
most
acceptable
meal
of
the
day
taken
sitting
under
the
hedge
with
the
scent
of
roses
in
the
air
and
the
summer
sunshine
falling
across
the
fields
by
the
end
of
the
first
evening
the
grange
girls
decided
that
though
they
wished
they
had
backs
the
experience
on
the
whole
was
great
fun
they
liked
the
camp
life
and
even
their
beds
i
vote
we
do
sleep
with
our
heads
to
the
though
said
raymonde
you
flung
out
your
arms
morvyth
and
gave
me
such
a
whack
across
the
face
i
wonder
i
have
a
black
eye
turn
the
other
way
with
our
feet
to
the
pole
right
you
are
i
so
sleepy
i
do
mind
which
end
up
i
am
if
i
can
only
shut
my
eyes
conceded
katherine
yawning
lustily
i
sha
need
rocking
either
agreed
morvyth
perched
on
her
raymonde
was
very
soon
in
the
land
of
nod
she
was
dreaming
a
confused
jumble
about
miss
gibbs
and
gipsies
and
strawberries
when
she
suddenly
awoke
with
a
strong
impression
that
someone
was
pulling
her
hair
she
sat
up
feeling
rather
scared
the
tent
was
perfectly
quiet
the
other
girls
lay
asleep
each
on
her
own
sack
with
her
feet
to
the
central
pole
i
must
have
dreamt
it
thought
raymonde
settling
down
again
she
had
scarcely
closed
her
eyes
however
before
she
heard
a
curious
noise
in
the
vicinity
of
her
ear
and
something
unmistakably
gave
her
plait
a
violent
wrench
she
started
up
with
a
yell
in
time
to
see
an
enormous
head
withdraw
itself
from
the
tent
door
a
clatter
of
hoofs
followed
what
the
matter
cried
the
girls
waking
at
the
disturbance
and
what
is
it
exclaimed
miss
gibbs
aroused
also
and
hurrying
in
from
the
tent
but
raymonde
was
laughing
i
had
the
fright
of
my
life
she
announced
i
thought
a
bogy
or
a
kelpie
was
devouring
me
but
it
was
only
dandy
the
old
pony
he
stuck
his
head
round
the
tent
door
and
mistook
my
hair
for
a
mouthful
of
grass
the
wretch
i
seen
him
feeding
near
the
tents
before
said
valentine
there
some
particular
sort
of
grass
here
that
he
specially
likes
it
rather
the
limit
though
to
have
him
coming
inside
he
ought
to
be
allowed
in
this
field
at
night
declared
miss
gibbs
i
shall
speak
to
cox
and
ask
to
have
him
put
in
another
pasture
we
ca
close
our
tent
doors
or
we
should
be
suffocated
i
hope
we
sha
have
any
other
nocturnal
visitors
it
a
good
thing
we
have
no
valuables
with
us
i
do
trust
those
gipsies
miss
gibbs
fears
turned
out
to
be
only
too
well
founded
for
on
the
morning
but
one
following
there
was
a
hue
and
cry
in
the
camp
the
larder
had
been
raided
during
the
night
and
all
the
provisions
stolen
the
canteen
matron
and
the
cook
were
in
despair
as
nothing
was
left
for
breakfast
and
the
workers
would
have
gone
hungry
had
not
a
deputation
of
them
visited
the
farm
and
begged
sufficient
bread
and
jam
to
provide
a
meal
a
lovely
ham
gone
and
four
pounds
of
butter
and
a
joint
of
cold
beef
and
all
the
bread
mourned
the
distracted
matron
i
shall
have
to
go
in
to
ledcombe
again
this
morning
for
fresh
supplies
and
i
believe
cox
wants
the
pony
himself
we
ought
to
be
able
to
track
the
thieves
said
miss
gibbs
firmly
there
should
be
an
inspection
at
and
anyone
seen
eating
ham
should
be
under
suspicion
they
be
far
too
clever
to
eat
it
publicly
objected
miss
hoyle
the
lady
journalist
gipsies
are
an
uncommonly
tricky
set
they
probably
had
a
midnight
feast
and
finished
the
last
crumb
of
our
provisions
before
daybreak
we
shall
get
no
satisfaction
from
cox
he
say
he
not
responsible
then
we
must
take
precautions
that
it
does
happen
again
decreed
miss
gibbs
is
it
possible
to
procure
a
meat
safe
i
never
heard
of
a
camp
being
without
one
perhaps
you
have
had
much
experience
remarked
the
canteen
matron
icily
she
thought
miss
gibbs
bossy
and
interfering
and
considered
that
she
knew
her
own
business
best
without
suggestions
from
outsiders
the
grange
girls
chuckled
inwardly
to
hear
their
teacher
thus
snubbed
they
hoped
a
retort
and
even
a
wrangle
might
follow
but
miss
gibbs
had
too
much
common
sense
and
restraining
herself
stalked
away
with
as
unconcerned
an
aspect
as
possible
look
here
old
sport
whispered
raymonde
to
morvyth
somebody
ought
to
take
this
matter
up
i
consider
it
a
job
for
us
let
watch
and
see
if
we
ca
catch
the
prowling
sneaks
are
you
game
rather
it
a
blossomy
idea
only
do
let
gibbie
get
wind
of
it
do
i
ever
go
and
tell
gibbie
my
jinky
little
plans
it
not
this
child
usual
way
of
proceeding
raymonde
and
morvyth
had
intended
to
run
this
little
expedition
on
their
own
but
in
the
end
they
were
obliged
to
let
the
rest
of
the
tent
into
the
secret
as
it
was
impossible
to
go
to
bed
fully
dressed
without
exciting
comment
their
comrades
refused
to
be
left
out
so
it
was
decided
that
all
six
under
raymonde
leadership
should
mount
guard
over
the
larder
they
drew
their
blankets
up
to
their
noses
and
pretended
to
be
very
sleepy
when
miss
gibbs
came
to
take
a
last
look
at
them
before
retiring
apparently
she
noticed
nothing
unusual
for
she
only
glanced
quickly
round
and
went
softly
away
the
sentries
allowed
nearly
an
hour
to
pass
before
they
dared
to
venture
forth
until
that
time
the
camp
was
not
really
quiet
the
university
students
were
a
lively
set
apt
to
keep
up
their
fun
late
and
the
secondary
school
girls
often
talked
persistently
to
the
annoyance
of
their
neighbours
at
last
however
all
lights
were
out
and
a
profound
silence
reigned
not
even
an
owl
hooted
and
as
dandy
had
been
banished
from
the
field
even
his
crunching
of
the
grass
was
absent
raymonde
crept
from
her
blankets
and
listened
her
companions
to
judge
from
their
breathing
were
sound
asleep
she
felt
much
tempted
to
awaken
only
morvyth
but
she
knew
that
if
she
omitted
to
call
the
others
their
reproaches
next
morning
would
be
too
unbearable
so
she
roused
the
five
taking
torchlights
ready
but
not
switched
on
they
stole
from
the
tent
towards
the
scene
of
action
the
larder
was
only
a
portion
of
the
marquee
curtained
off
so
it
was
really
an
easy
prey
for
marauders
the
girls
could
not
quite
decide
where
would
be
their
best
post
for
sentry
duty
whether
to
dispose
themselves
in
positions
outside
or
to
keep
guard
within
the
tent
as
it
was
rather
a
cold
night
they
plumped
for
the
latter
cautiously
as
indians
on
the
war
trail
they
crept
across
the
marquee
towards
the
farther
corner
where
the
stores
were
kept
raymonde
as
leader
went
first
with
her
in
close
attendance
behind
her
very
very
gently
she
drew
back
the
curtains
and
entered
the
larder
it
was
in
here
and
she
began
to
grope
her
way
along
the
wall
then
she
stopped
for
in
front
of
her
she
fancied
she
heard
breathing
she
listened
all
was
silent
she
started
again
intending
to
go
to
the
far
side
of
the
table
she
put
out
her
hand
to
guide
herself
and
came
in
contact
with
something
warm
and
soft
like
human
flesh
in
spite
of
herself
she
could
not
suppress
an
exclamation
it
was
too
horrible
actually
to
touch
a
burglar
she
had
not
bargained
to
find
one
already
in
possession
of
the
larder
instantly
the
girls
behind
her
flashed
on
their
torchlights
and
the
little
sentry
party
found
themselves
confronted
with
miss
gibbs
yes
it
was
miss
gibbs
crouching
down
near
the
table
with
miss
hoyle
the
lady
journalist
close
to
her
both
looking
very
determined
and
ready
to
tackle
any
number
of
gipsy
thieves
the
astonishment
was
mutual
what
are
you
doing
here
girls
asked
miss
gibbs
sharply
the
schoolmistress
in
her
rising
to
the
surface
only
trying
to
guard
the
larder
faltered
raymonde
that
just
what
we
doing
explained
miss
hoyle
at
that
moment
the
matron
put
in
an
appearance
she
also
had
been
on
the
qui
vive
in
defence
of
her
stores
and
hearing
voices
was
sure
she
had
trapped
the
thieves
she
had
already
passed
on
the
alarm
and
in
a
few
moments
acting
on
a
preconcerted
signal
cox
and
several
of
the
farm
hands
burst
upon
the
scene
ready
to
knock
down
and
secure
intruders
explanations
naturally
followed
it
seemed
that
nearly
everyone
in
the
camp
had
private
and
separately
arranged
watch
parties
each
unconscious
of
the
others
vigilance
and
that
all
had
mistaken
their
neighbours
for
burglars
no
one
quite
knew
at
first
whether
to
be
annoyed
or
amused
but
in
the
end
humour
won
and
a
general
laugh
ensued
as
nobody
felt
disposed
to
spend
the
whole
night
on
sentry
duty
the
matter
was
settled
by
miss
corley
and
miss
hoyle
proposing
to
bring
their
beds
and
sleep
in
the
marquee
for
the
future
i
wake
easily
so
i
should
hear
the
very
faintest
footstep
sure
said
miss
hoyle
i
going
to
keep
a
revolver
under
my
pillow
too
and
i
hope
you
spread
that
information
all
over
the
gardens
and
add
that
i
accustomed
to
use
it
and
would
as
soon
shoot
a
man
as
look
at
him
whether
through
fear
of
miss
hoyle
bloodthirsty
intentions
or
with
a
shrewd
suspicion
that
cox
was
on
the
watch
the
marauders
did
not
repeat
their
midnight
visit
and
left
the
camp
in
peace
miss
hoyle
seemed
almost
disappointed
being
a
journalist
she
had
perhaps
hoped
to
make
copy
of
the
adventure
and
write
a
sparkling
column
for
her
newspaper
the
grange
girls
decided
that
it
was
not
the
revolver
but
the
dread
of
miss
gibbs
which
had
scared
away
the
gipsies
they
seen
her
in
the
fields
you
know
and
i
should
think
one
look
would
be
enough
said
morvyth
she
has
a
here
my
good
man
and
let
me
argue
the
matter
out
with
you
expression
on
her
face
this
last
day
or
two
that
should
daunt
the
most
foolhardy
if
she
caught
a
burglar
she
certainly
sit
him
down
and
rub
social
reform
and
political
economy
into
him
before
she
let
him
go
chapter
xi
canteen
assistants
the
many
acres
of
strawberry
gardens
were
situated
some
little
distance
from
the
camp
so
that
the
walk
backwards
and
forwards
occupied
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
each
way
once
work
was
begun
nobody
returned
to
the
tents
except
on
some
very
urgent
errand
as
the
loss
of
time
involved
would
be
great
a
really
valid
excuse
occurred
one
morning
however
aveline
missed
her
watch
and
remembered
that
she
had
laid
it
on
the
breakfast
table
in
the
marquee
it
seemed
very
unsafe
to
leave
it
there
so
she
reported
the
matter
to
miss
gibbs
who
told
her
to
go
at
once
and
fetch
it
and
sent
raymonde
with
her
not
liking
her
to
have
the
walk
alone
the
two
girls
were
rather
glad
of
the
excuse
they
were
not
shirkers
but
the
picking
made
their
backs
tired
and
the
run
through
the
fields
was
a
welcome
change
they
found
the
watch
still
lying
on
the
table
in
the
marquee
and
aveline
clasped
it
round
her
wrist
they
were
leaving
the
tent
when
miss
jones
the
canteen
matron
bustled
in
looking
so
worried
that
they
ventured
to
ask
what
the
matter
she
stopped
as
if
it
were
a
relief
to
explode
matter
indeed
you
have
no
potatoes
or
vegetables
for
your
dinner
that
all
and
nothing
at
all
for
your
supper
harper
has
turned
up
and
i
ca
leave
the
place
with
nobody
about
i
meant
to
go
to
ledcombe
this
morning
for
fresh
supplies
and
day
too
the
shops
will
shut
at
one
oh
dear
i
think
what
to
be
done
these
village
helps
are
more
trouble
than
they
worth
harper
the
cook
had
failed
the
camp
before
taking
an
occasional
day
off
without
any
previous
notice
to
attend
to
her
domestic
affairs
at
home
miss
jones
knew
from
former
experience
that
she
would
either
stroll
in
casually
about
midday
or
more
probably
would
not
come
at
all
until
in
the
meantime
fifty
people
required
meals
and
the
situation
was
urgent
could
we
go
to
ledcombe
for
you
suggested
raymonde
the
matron
face
cleared
she
jumped
at
the
proposition
geordie
somewhere
about
the
buildings
he
harness
the
pony
for
you
if
you
can
manage
to
drive
i
give
you
a
list
of
needed
the
meat
come
and
i
can
put
that
on
to
stew
and
get
the
puddings
ready
and
if
you
be
back
by
eleven
there
be
time
to
wash
the
potatoes
it
only
eight
now
i
write
down
all
i
want
done
it
was
impossible
to
go
back
to
the
gardens
and
ask
permission
from
miss
gibbs
the
girls
considered
that
the
matron
authority
was
sufficient
to
justify
the
expedition
which
was
certainly
for
the
benefit
of
the
camp
neither
of
them
had
ever
handled
the
reins
in
her
life
before
so
the
drive
would
be
a
decided
adventure
armed
with
a
long
list
of
necessaries
two
huge
market
baskets
and
miss
jones
containing
a
supply
of
money
they
started
off
to
the
farm
to
find
geordie
a
boy
who
did
odd
jobs
about
the
after
a
considerable
hunt
through
the
barns
they
discovered
him
at
last
inside
the
pigsty
and
bribed
him
with
twopence
to
go
and
catch
the
pony
dandy
was
enjoying
himself
in
the
field
and
did
not
come
readily
indeed
the
girls
were
almost
despairing
before
he
was
finally
led
in
by
his
forelock
the
little
conveyance
was
a
small
very
gig
and
though
in
its
youth
it
may
have
possessed
a
smart
appearance
it
was
now
decidedly
more
useful
than
ornamental
the
varnish
was
worn
and
scratched
the
cushions
had
been
with
cheap
american
cloth
the
waterproof
apron
was
threadbare
and
one
of
the
was
split
the
harness
also
was
of
the
most
ancient
description
and
the
rough
pony
badly
needed
clipping
so
that
the
whole
was
deplorably
shabby
and
it
hardly
the
kind
of
thing
one
would
drive
in
round
the
park
laughed
aveline
scarcely
it
the
queerest
little
on
two
wheels
i
ever
seen
but
what
does
it
matter
nobody
knows
us
in
ledcombe
the
main
point
is
will
it
get
us
over
the
ground
i
wish
we
bicycles
instead
but
we
could
bring
back
a
whole
cargo
of
stores
on
them
i
think
it
with
much
laughter
and
many
little
jokes
the
girls
tucked
themselves
into
their
funny
conveyance
evidently
greatly
to
the
interest
of
dandy
who
turned
his
head
anxiously
as
they
mounted
the
step
he
do
be
a
wise
explained
geordie
you
see
sometimes
rivers
takes
his
as
weighs
seventeen
stone
and
with
a
calf
or
maybe
a
young
pig
as
well
it
do
make
a
big
load
dandy
be
one
to
overwork
hisself
i
reckon
you
have
to
use
the
whip
to
he
neither
of
the
girls
had
even
the
most
elementary
experience
of
driving
but
raymonde
as
the
elder
and
the
one
who
in
general
possessed
the
greater
amount
of
nerve
boldly
seized
the
reins
and
armed
herself
with
the
whip
geordie
released
dandy
head
and
gave
him
a
sounding
smack
as
a
delicate
hint
to
depart
a
proceeding
which
brought
clouds
of
dust
from
his
shaggy
coat
and
caused
him
to
scramble
suddenly
forward
and
plunge
down
the
lane
at
quite
an
adventurous
and
stylish
pace
if
he
wo
go
just
cuss
at
him
yelled
geordie
as
a
last
piece
of
advice
though
dandy
might
make
a
gallant
beginning
he
had
no
intention
of
breaking
the
record
for
speed
and
at
the
end
of
a
few
hundred
yards
dropped
into
an
ambling
a
form
of
locomotion
which
seemed
to
jolt
the
badly
hung
little
gig
to
its
uttermost
it
rather
a
painful
form
of
exercise
gasped
aveline
setting
her
feet
firmly
in
an
attempt
to
avoid
the
jarring
i
believe
something
must
be
wrong
with
the
springs
ca
you
make
him
go
faster
only
if
i
beat
him
and
then
suppose
he
runs
away
well
if
he
does
we
each
cling
on
to
one
rein
and
pull
i
suppose
driving
is
pretty
much
like
steering
a
bicycle
is
the
rule
of
the
road
the
same
of
course
do
be
silly
well
i
never
can
make
out
why
it
different
for
why
should
they
go
to
the
right
and
vehicles
to
the
left
you
may
be
certain
all
motors
will
take
the
middle
of
the
road
at
any
rate
we
shall
have
to
be
prepared
to
make
a
dash
for
the
hedge
when
we
hear
a
round
the
corner
i
no
mind
to
be
run
over
and
squashed
out
flat
like
the
naughty
children
who
teased
diogenes
in
an
old
i
used
to
have
i
always
thought
it
was
a
lovely
idea
of
his
to
start
the
tub
rolling
and
simply
flatten
them
out
like
pancakes
i
expect
it
a
true
incident
if
we
only
knew
one
of
those
things
that
are
not
historical
but
so
probable
that
you
sure
they
must
have
happened
he
reason
it
out
by
philosophy
first
and
feel
it
was
a
triumph
of
mind
over
matter
perhaps
his
chuckles
when
he
saw
the
result
were
the
origin
of
the
term
cynical
laugh
the
children
in
the
picture
looked
so
exactly
like
pieces
of
rolled
pastry
when
the
tub
had
done
its
work
i
do
think
the
motors
would
have
any
more
compunction
than
diogenes
so
the
moral
is
give
them
as
wide
a
berth
as
possible
if
we
were
driving
a
big
i
enjoy
blocking
the
way
they
had
turned
out
of
the
lane
and
were
now
on
the
high
road
to
ledcombe
but
progressing
at
an
extremely
slow
pace
raymonde
ventured
to
apply
the
whip
but
on
the
pony
thick
coat
it
appeared
to
produce
as
slight
an
impression
as
the
tickling
of
a
fly
and
when
she
endeavoured
to
give
a
more
efficacious
flick
she
got
the
lash
ignominiously
entangled
in
the
harness
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
pull
up
and
for
aveline
to
climb
laboriously
from
the
trap
and
release
the
piece
of
string
rendered
more
careful
by
this
catastrophe
raymonde
wielded
her
whip
with
caution
and
gave
what
encouragement
she
could
by
jerking
the
reins
vigorously
and
occasionally
ejaculating
an
energetic
go
on
dandy
the
pony
however
was
a
cunning
little
creature
and
knowing
perfectly
well
that
he
was
in
amateur
hands
took
full
advantage
of
the
situation
under
the
excuse
of
a
very
slight
hill
he
reduced
his
pace
to
a
crawl
and
began
to
crop
succulent
mouthfuls
of
grass
from
the
as
a
means
of
combining
pleasure
with
business
it
was
only
by
judicious
proddings
with
the
of
the
whip
that
he
could
be
induced
to
hasten
his
steps
in
spite
of
the
difficulties
with
dandy
the
drive
was
enjoyable
the
country
was
very
pretty
for
they
were
nearing
the
hills
and
the
landscape
was
more
diversified
than
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
the
camp
they
passed
through
a
beech
wood
where
the
sun
was
glinting
through
leaves
as
transparent
and
delicate
as
fairies
wings
i
feel
like
primeval
man
said
aveline
the
wander
fever
is
on
me
and
i
want
to
see
fresh
things
we
shall
be
in
ledcombe
soon
i
do
mean
towns
it
something
much
subtler
different
fields
unexplored
woods
a
new
piece
of
river
or
even
a
patch
of
grass
with
flowers
i
have
found
before
i
know
agreed
raymonde
it
the
feeling
one
had
when
one
was
small
and
read
about
how
the
youngest
prince
set
out
into
the
great
wide
world
to
seek
his
fortune
i
always
envied
him
or
the
they
had
a
splendid
time
roaming
through
the
forest
and
tilting
a
spear
against
anyone
who
was
ready
for
single
combat
one
might
lead
a
very
merry
life
yet
like
robin
hood
and
his
band
in
the
greenwood
though
we
should
be
the
king
red
deer
it
was
pretty
much
like
camp
life
i
dare
say
only
a
little
rougher
than
ours
more
like
the
gipsy
diggings
talking
of
gipsies
i
believe
you
conjured
them
up
that
looks
like
a
caravan
over
there
i
expect
it
is
some
more
of
the
tribe
coming
to
pick
strawberries
the
gipsies
collected
in
a
group
in
the
roadway
were
loudly
bewailing
a
catastrophe
for
their
horse
had
just
fallen
down
dead
until
they
could
obtain
another
they
must
needs
stay
by
the
roadside
and
could
not
get
on
to
the
gardens
they
a
handsome
set
said
aveline
taking
out
her
camera
which
she
had
brought
with
her
just
look
at
the
children
it
the
mother
that
attracts
me
most
said
raymonde
the
woman
indeed
was
a
beautiful
specimen
of
romany
blood
tall
and
dark
with
great
flashing
eyes
and
coarse
black
hair
she
resembled
a
man
more
than
the
gentler
sex
she
wore
a
very
short
red
skirt
and
had
a
little
barrel
hung
over
her
shoulder
by
a
strap
i
wish
i
brought
my
camera
murmured
raymonde
i
simply
room
to
stuff
it
in
it
was
a
choice
between
it
and
my
and
i
thought
gibbie
treat
me
to
if
i
left
out
my
pyjamas
aveline
descended
from
the
trap
to
take
her
photo
hoping
to
get
a
snapshot
of
the
gipsies
just
as
they
were
grouped
in
dramatic
attitudes
round
the
dead
horse
at
the
sight
of
two
strangers
however
the
tribal
instincts
asserted
themselves
and
the
woman
was
pushed
hurriedly
forward
by
the
rest
tell
your
fortune
my
pretty
lady
she
began
to
aveline
in
a
voice
cross
the
poor
gipsy
hand
with
a
shilling
and
she
read
the
stars
for
you
no
thanks
said
aveline
rather
scared
by
the
woman
jaunty
impudent
manner
i
only
wanted
to
take
a
photo
cross
the
gipsy
hand
first
lady
before
you
take
her
photo
you
want
to
know
the
future
lady
i
can
read
something
in
your
face
that
will
surprise
you
just
a
shilling
lady
only
a
shilling
the
rest
of
the
tribe
were
approaching
the
trap
and
begging
from
raymonde
looking
so
rough
and
importunate
that
the
girls
began
to
be
thoroughly
alarmed
and
afraid
for
the
safety
of
the
money
they
had
brought
with
them
aveline
regretted
her
folly
in
having
dismounted
from
the
gig
and
backed
towards
it
again
pestered
by
the
gipsy
she
did
not
want
a
photo
now
only
to
get
away
as
swiftly
as
possible
but
that
the
crew
did
not
seem
disposed
to
allow
a
dusky
hand
was
laid
on
the
pony
reins
and
a
voluble
tongue
poured
forth
a
jumble
of
planets
and
predictions
the
situation
had
grown
extremely
unpleasant
for
the
girls
when
fortunately
a
cart
was
seen
coming
in
the
distance
the
gipsies
melted
away
instantly
aveline
jumped
into
the
trap
and
raymonde
whipped
up
dandy
who
evidently
resenting
on
his
own
account
the
tribe
interference
set
off
at
a
swinging
pace
and
soon
left
the
caravan
behind
in
another
ten
minutes
they
had
reached
the
outskirts
of
ledcombe
and
arrived
at
civilization
the
little
country
town
was
one
of
those
sleepy
places
where
you
could
almost
shoot
a
cannon
down
the
high
street
without
injuring
anybody
there
were
shops
with
goods
in
the
windows
a
market
hall
closed
except
on
tuesdays
a
church
with
a
picturesque
tower
a
bank
and
a
large
number
of
it
seemed
to
the
girls
as
if
almost
every
other
building
displayed
a
green
dragon
or
a
red
lion
or
a
black
boar
or
some
other
sign
to
indicate
that
the
excessive
thirst
of
the
inhabitants
could
be
satisfied
within
raymonde
felt
rather
nervous
at
driving
in
the
town
but
fortunately
being
a
thursday
morning
there
was
little
traffic
in
the
streets
had
it
been
market
day
she
might
have
got
into
difficulties
she
sat
outside
in
the
gig
while
aveline
went
into
the
shops
and
purchased
the
various
commodities
on
miss
jones
list
these
were
so
many
that
by
the
time
everything
had
been
bought
the
gig
was
crammed
to
overflowing
leaving
only
just
room
for
the
two
girls
raymonde
sat
with
her
feet
on
a
sack
of
potatoes
aveline
clutched
the
big
baskets
full
of
loaves
and
vegetables
while
parcels
were
piled
up
on
the
floor
and
on
the
seat
their
business
had
taken
them
longer
than
they
expected
and
the
church
clock
warned
them
that
they
must
hurry
if
the
potatoes
were
to
be
cooked
in
time
for
dinner
as
soon
as
they
were
clear
of
the
town
raymonde
attempted
to
communicate
the
urgency
of
the
case
to
dandy
her
efforts
were
in
vain
however
that
faithless
quadruped
utterly
refused
to
proceed
faster
than
an
ambling
and
took
no
notice
of
whipping
prodding
or
poking
beyond
flicking
his
ears
as
if
he
thought
the
flies
were
troublesome
we
shall
never
get
back
to
the
camp
at
this
rate
lamented
raymonde
what
are
we
to
do
geordie
suggested
words
grinned
aveline
i
expect
what
dandy
accustomed
to
from
most
of
his
drivers
do
suppose
he
be
particular
as
to
the
exact
words
said
raymonde
probably
it
the
tone
of
voice
that
does
it
let
wait
till
he
gets
to
the
top
of
this
hill
then
i
prod
him
again
and
we
both
growl
out
on
and
see
if
it
has
any
effect
if
it
has
i
shall
lead
him
and
run
by
his
head
it
would
be
quicker
than
this
pace
we
try
shouting
first
here
we
are
at
the
top
of
the
hill
now
both
together
in
the
gruffest
voice
you
can
muster
are
you
ready
one
two
three
go
on
dandy
whether
it
was
really
the
result
of
the
deep
bass
tones
or
unexpected
prod
or
merely
the
fact
that
they
had
arrived
at
the
summit
of
the
slope
the
girls
could
not
determine
but
the
effect
on
the
pony
was
instantaneous
he
gathered
all
four
legs
together
and
gave
a
sudden
jump
apparently
of
apprehension
then
set
off
down
the
hill
as
fast
as
he
could
tear
hold
him
in
yelled
aveline
alarmed
at
such
an
access
of
speed
i
trying
to
replied
raymonde
pulling
at
the
reins
as
hard
as
her
arms
would
allow
dandy
however
seemed
determined
for
once
to
show
his
paces
and
took
no
more
notice
of
raymonde
checking
than
he
had
previously
done
of
her
urgings
the
little
trap
was
flying
like
the
wind
when
without
the
least
warning
a
most
unanticipated
thing
happened
the
worn
crazy
old
straps
of
the
harness
broke
and
the
pony
giving
a
wrench
that
also
snapped
the
reins
ran
straight
out
of
the
shafts
the
gig
promptly
fell
forward
precipitating
both
girls
amid
a
shower
of
parcels
into
the
road
where
they
sat
for
a
moment
or
two
almost
dazed
with
the
shock
watching
the
retreating
heels
of
dandy
as
he
fled
in
terror
of
the
dangling
straps
that
were
hitting
him
on
the
flanks
are
you
hurt
asked
raymonde
at
last
getting
up
and
tenderly
feeling
her
scraped
shins
no
only
rather
bruised
and
astonished
replied
aveline
then
the
humour
of
the
situation
seemed
to
strike
both
for
they
burst
into
peals
of
laughter
what
are
we
to
do
with
the
trap
said
aveline
we
ca
drag
it
back
ourselves
and
what
about
the
pony
he
playing
truant
and
rivers
said
he
was
so
quiet
and
that
a
baby
in
arms
could
drive
him
declared
raymonde
much
aggrieved
well
they
should
patch
their
harness
with
bits
of
string
said
aveline
it
very
unsafe
i
noticed
it
before
we
started
out
but
i
supposed
it
would
be
all
right
hallo
here
dandy
back
caught
him
it
was
the
gipsy
woman
who
made
her
appearance
leading
the
pony
she
looked
rather
scared
and
much
relieved
when
she
saw
raymonde
and
aveline
standing
safe
and
sound
in
the
middle
of
the
road
i
thought
for
sure
someone
was
killed
she
remarked
when
she
reached
the
scene
of
the
accident
though
the
girls
had
been
frightened
of
her
before
they
were
glad
to
see
her
now
for
they
had
no
notion
what
to
do
next
she
at
once
assumed
command
of
the
situation
sent
one
of
the
children
who
had
followed
her
back
to
the
caravan
to
fetch
her
husband
and
with
his
assistance
set
to
work
and
patched
up
the
harness
we
tinkers
by
trade
lady
so
we
know
how
to
put
in
a
rivet
or
two
enough
to
take
you
safely
home
at
any
rate
but
they
do
ought
to
send
that
harness
out
again
it
as
rotten
as
can
be
rivers
did
you
say
why
it
his
farm
as
we
going
to
to
pick
strawberries
as
soon
as
we
can
get
there
with
our
horse
lying
dead
a
fellow
feeling
makes
us
wondrous
kind
and
before
the
harness
was
mended
the
girls
had
struck
up
quite
a
friendship
with
the
gipsies
which
was
further
cemented
by
the
transference
of
half
a
crown
from
raymonde
purse
to
the
brown
hand
of
the
woman
and
the
bestowal
of
the
greater
part
of
aveline
chocolates
into
the
mouths
of
the
children
dandy
was
placed
between
the
shafts
once
more
and
the
parcels
were
restored
to
the
gig
the
girls
being
doubtful
as
to
the
security
of
the
harness
did
not
venture
to
mount
inside
but
led
the
pony
by
the
head
lest
he
should
be
inspired
to
race
down
another
hill
it
was
a
slow
progress
back
and
the
workers
were
just
returning
from
the
fields
as
they
reached
the
camp
naturally
there
were
no
potatoes
for
dinner
that
day
though
raymonde
and
aveline
congratulated
themselves
that
the
bread
was
just
in
time
they
were
the
heroines
of
the
hour
when
they
related
their
adventures
and
even
miss
gibbs
did
not
scold
them
though
they
afterwards
heard
her
remarking
to
miss
hoyle
that
miss
jones
was
a
poor
manager
and
ought
to
make
better
arrangements
about
catering
gibbie
got
to
let
fly
at
somebody
chuckled
raymonde
if
it
be
us
it
someone
else
but
she
better
not
try
criticizing
miss
jones
methods
to
her
face
or
there
be
fighting
in
the
camp
would
i
like
to
see
a
match
between
them
sighed
aveline
stake
my
all
on
gibbie
any
day
i
do
know
said
raymonde
reflectively
gibbie
has
fire
and
spirit
and
powers
of
sarcasm
and
traditions
of
scotch
ancestry
but
there
a
suggestion
of
icy
stubbornness
about
miss
jones
that
looks
capable
of
standing
out
against
anybody
with
bulldog
grit
i
believe
i
back
miss
jones
if
it
came
to
the
point
chapter
xii
amateur
detectives
the
girls
felt
that
their
short
week
of
strawberry
picking
was
crammed
more
full
of
experiences
than
a
whole
term
of
ordinary
school
life
there
were
so
many
interesting
people
at
the
camp
who
had
been
working
at
various
absorbing
occupations
and
were
ready
to
talk
about
their
adventures
miss
hoyle
could
give
accounts
of
celebrities
whom
she
had
been
sent
to
interview
by
her
newspaper
miss
gordon
the
social
settlement
secretary
had
stories
of
factory
girls
and
their
funny
ways
and
sayings
to
relate
nurse
gibbons
had
much
to
tell
about
her
training
in
a
london
hospital
miss
parker
was
an
authority
on
munition
work
and
miss
lowe
an
artist
drew
spirited
sketches
of
everybody
and
everything
to
the
amusement
of
all
there
was
a
great
feeling
of
comradeship
and
bonhomie
in
the
camp
everyone
was
ready
to
be
friendly
and
to
meet
everybody
else
on
equal
terms
there
was
only
one
member
who
did
not
seem
responsive
and
ready
to
mix
with
the
others
this
was
vernon
a
shy
reserved
little
woman
who
never
blossomed
out
into
any
confidences
she
would
sit
and
listen
attentively
to
all
the
tales
told
by
miss
hoyle
and
miss
parker
and
would
even
question
the
latter
about
her
munition
work
but
she
gave
no
information
at
all
respecting
herself
or
her
occupation
it
was
rumoured
that
she
was
a
widow
but
the
report
was
not
confirmed
the
marlowe
grange
girls
did
not
much
like
her
and
took
very
little
notice
of
her
it
was
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
ignore
her
for
she
seemed
to
shrink
from
even
the
most
ordinary
civilities
and
would
vouchsafe
nothing
but
a
curt
reply
when
spoken
to
on
the
morning
after
the
expedition
to
ledcombe
there
was
considerable
excitement
in
raymonde
tent
katherine
woke
up
with
her
face
covered
with
a
rash
morvyth
who
slept
next
to
her
noticed
it
immediately
and
told
her
that
she
had
better
stay
in
bed
until
miss
gibbs
saw
her
naturally
miss
gibbs
was
in
a
state
of
great
apprehension
and
feared
that
katherine
must
be
sickening
for
measles
scarlatina
or
some
other
infectious
complaint
manifestly
the
first
thing
to
be
done
was
to
send
for
a
doctor
the
nearest
medical
man
lived
at
ledcombe
and
in
order
to
save
time
raymonde
and
aveline
offered
to
walk
in
to
shipley
village
and
telephone
to
him
from
the
post
office
there
nice
little
business
if
kitty
starts
an
epidemic
in
the
camp
said
aveline
as
they
went
along
i
suppose
we
could
go
back
to
school
no
and
we
should
be
allowed
to
pick
strawberries
either
if
we
were
infectious
they
turn
us
out
of
the
camp
and
treat
us
like
lepers
oh
i
say
it
would
be
no
fun
at
all
they
had
reached
shipley
by
this
time
a
little
quaint
place
consisting
of
one
village
street
of
picturesque
cottages
most
of
them
covered
with
roses
or
vines
and
with
flowery
gardens
in
front
the
tiny
church
stood
on
a
mound
surrounded
by
trees
and
looked
far
smaller
than
the
handsome
vicarage
whose
great
gates
opened
opposite
the
school
the
post
office
appeared
also
to
be
a
general
store
where
articles
of
every
description
were
on
sale
from
the
ceiling
were
suspended
tin
pails
coils
of
rows
of
boots
or
shoes
pans
kettles
brooms
and
lanterns
while
the
walls
were
lined
with
shelves
containing
groceries
and
draperies
stationery
hosiery
quack
medicines
garden
seeds
and
in
fact
an
absolutely
miscellaneous
assortment
of
goods
and
chattels
some
old
some
new
some
fresh
some
faded
some
appetizing
and
some
decidedly
stale
raymonde
asked
to
use
the
telephone
and
retired
to
the
little
portion
of
the
shop
reserved
for
that
instrument
where
she
successfully
rang
up
wilton
and
received
his
promise
to
call
during
the
morning
at
the
camp
this
most
pressing
business
done
they
proceeded
to
execute
a
few
commissions
for
miss
jones
miss
lowe
and
several
other
members
of
the
party
miss
hoyle
had
begged
them
to
buy
a
few
yards
of
anything
with
which
she
might
trim
a
large
shady
rush
hat
she
had
brought
with
her
so
the
girls
asked
the
postmistress
to
show
them
some
white
ribbon
that
elderly
spinster
having
first
with
considerable
ingenuity
satisfied
her
curiosity
as
to
the
object
for
which
they
required
it
commenced
a
vigorous
hunt
among
the
miscellaneous
collection
of
boxes
in
her
establishment
i
know
i
have
some
she
soliloquized
for
it
was
only
six
weeks
ago
i
sold
a
yard
and
a
half
to
cox
to
finish
a
she
was
making
where
can
i
have
put
it
no
this
is
and
and
this
neuralgic
powders
and
babies
comforters
it
might
have
got
into
the
small
wares
but
i
had
that
out
only
yesterday
why
here
it
is
after
all
among
the
tapes
and
buttons
the
girls
soon
found
that
shopping
at
shipley
possessed
an
immense
advantage
over
kindred
expeditions
in
town
when
there
was
only
a
single
article
no
selection
could
be
made
it
was
impossible
to
be
bewildered
with
too
many
fineries
and
this
or
nothing
offered
a
unique
simplicity
in
the
way
of
choice
miss
pearson
the
postmistress
decided
for
them
that
the
ribbon
was
the
right
width
and
quality
and
even
offered
a
few
hints
on
the
subject
of
trimming
i
believe
she
longing
to
do
it
herself
whispered
aveline
are
those
specimens
of
her
millinery
in
the
window
i
as
soon
wear
a
cauliflower
on
my
head
as
that
erection
with
the
squirms
of
velvet
and
the
lace
border
you
sure
three
yards
will
be
sufficient
pattered
the
little
storekeeper
well
of
course
you
can
come
for
more
if
you
want
not
likely
to
be
selling
it
out
and
if
anybody
should
happen
to
come
and
ask
for
the
rest
of
it
i
get
them
to
wait
till
you
finished
trimming
your
hat
dear
me
if
i
have
mislaid
my
scissors
now
i
was
cutting
flowers
with
them
in
the
garden
before
breakfast
and
i
must
have
put
them
down
in
the
middle
of
the
sweet
peas
or
on
the
onion
bed
it
would
take
me
five
minutes
to
find
them
rather
not
wait
then
perhaps
you
excuse
my
using
this
without
further
apology
miss
pearson
seized
the
with
which
she
usually
operated
on
the
cheese
and
bacon
and
giving
it
a
hasty
wipe
upon
her
apron
proceeded
to
saw
through
the
ribbon
wrapping
up
the
three
yards
in
a
scrap
of
newspaper
i
sorry
i
out
of
paper
bags
she
announced
airily
but
the
traveller
only
calls
once
in
six
months
let
me
know
how
you
get
on
with
the
hat
and
if
you
want
any
help
that
i
can
give
you
just
bring
it
across
to
me
and
i
do
my
best
by
the
by
i
suppose
you
young
ladies
go
to
a
fine
do
you
learn
foreign
languages
there
why
yes
french
and
german
and
latin
most
of
us
replied
raymonde
rather
astonished
then
perhaps
you
be
so
good
as
to
help
me
for
there
a
letter
arrived
this
morning
i
can
make
nothing
of
it
certainly
not
in
english
but
whether
it
in
french
or
german
or
russian
or
what
i
ca
say
for
i
no
authority
on
languages
let
me
look
at
it
and
i
will
do
my
best
miss
pearson
bustled
to
her
postmistress
desk
and
with
an
air
of
great
importance
produced
the
letter
raymonde
took
it
carelessly
enough
but
when
she
had
grasped
a
few
sentences
her
expression
changed
she
read
it
through
to
the
end
then
laid
it
down
on
the
counter
without
offering
to
translate
this
is
not
addressed
to
you
i
think
she
remarked
you
quite
right
it
for
martha
verney
but
she
no
scholar
so
i
opened
it
for
her
like
i
do
for
many
folks
in
shipley
i
was
quite
taken
aback
when
i
could
make
it
out
and
martha
said
pearson
if
you
ca
read
it
i
sure
nobody
else
can
but
i
told
her
to
leave
it
in
case
anyone
came
into
the
shop
who
could
where
the
envelope
asked
raymonde
briefly
it
here
the
writing
is
small
and
queer
is
it
i
had
to
put
on
both
my
pairs
of
glasses
one
over
the
other
before
i
could
see
properly
you
made
a
very
great
mistake
said
raymonde
the
letter
is
addressed
to
vernon
poste
restante
shipley
well
i
never
i
thought
it
was
martha
verney
there
are
no
vernons
in
shipley
there
a
vernon
at
the
camp
no
doubt
it
intended
for
her
well
i
am
sorry
replied
miss
pearson
to
think
of
me
being
postmistress
all
these
years
and
making
such
a
mistake
i
put
it
in
an
official
envelope
and
readdress
it
she
get
it
is
it
important
i
suppose
you
were
able
to
understand
it
with
a
suggestive
glance
at
the
letter
as
if
she
hoped
raymonde
would
reveal
its
contents
raymonde
however
did
not
answer
her
question
i
think
you
had
better
seal
it
up
at
once
she
parried
and
drop
it
into
the
box
and
then
you
feel
you
finished
with
it
oh
it
will
be
all
right
i
hope
i
know
my
duties
if
people
addressed
their
envelopes
properly
in
a
plain
hand
there
be
no
mistakes
snapped
miss
pearson
highly
offended
putting
back
the
bone
of
contention
among
her
papers
and
locking
the
desk
she
knew
she
had
been
caught
tripping
and
wished
to
preserve
her
official
dignity
as
far
as
possible
i
opened
martha
verney
letters
for
the
last
fifteen
years
and
had
no
complaints
she
added
ave
said
raymonde
as
the
two
girls
left
the
shop
and
turned
up
the
lane
towards
the
camp
that
was
a
most
important
letter
i
tell
that
old
so
but
it
was
written
in
german
fr√§ulein
as
my
governess
for
four
years
before
i
came
to
school
so
i
can
read
german
pretty
easily
as
you
know
well
i
could
quite
understand
everything
but
the
general
drift
seems
to
be
that
vernon
has
a
husband
or
a
brother
or
a
cousin
named
carl
who
is
interned
not
so
far
away
from
here
and
is
trying
to
escape
this
evening
the
time
fixed
and
he
coming
into
the
neighbourhood
of
our
camp
and
she
to
meet
him
and
give
him
clothes
and
money
good
gracious
what
are
we
to
do
go
back
and
to
the
police
or
tell
mr
rivers
neither
said
raymonde
decidedly
after
that
idiotic
business
on
wednesday
night
trying
to
guard
the
larder
with
everybody
tumbling
over
everyone
else
it
worse
than
useless
to
tell
it
would
be
all
over
the
camp
in
five
minutes
and
vernon
would
hear
about
it
and
go
and
warn
somehow
as
for
the
police
they
spend
a
week
in
preliminaries
they
have
to
send
a
constable
to
look
at
the
letter
and
ask
questions
of
us
and
miss
pearson
and
rivers
and
no
end
of
nonsense
and
by
that
time
carl
would
be
safely
out
of
the
country
and
on
to
a
neutral
vessel
no
my
idea
is
to
a
thief
to
catch
a
thief
i
going
to
ask
the
gipsies
to
help
us
if
anybody
can
deal
with
the
business
they
can
topping
exclaimed
aveline
i
back
the
gipsies
against
the
best
detectives
in
england
i
go
to
the
field
and
talk
to
that
woman
who
caught
dandy
for
us
yesterday
rivers
sent
a
horse
last
night
and
brought
their
caravan
to
the
farm
so
they
all
be
at
work
picking
this
morning
do
tell
a
single
soul
in
the
camp
you
and
i
will
watch
vernon
and
follow
her
if
she
goes
out
and
the
gipsies
shall
keep
guard
in
the
wood
where
she
evidently
arranged
to
meet
him
get
a
reward
if
they
catch
him
that
spur
them
on
as
well
as
the
sport
of
the
thing
laughed
aveline
the
girls
were
fearfully
excited
at
the
idea
of
such
an
adventure
they
had
never
liked
vernon
and
now
saw
good
ground
for
their
suspicions
they
wondered
how
much
information
she
had
gleaned
at
the
camp
for
miss
hoyle
and
miss
parker
were
not
very
discreet
in
their
communications
they
walked
at
once
to
the
gardens
found
their
romany
friend
among
the
strawberries
and
with
much
secrecy
told
her
the
whole
affair
as
they
had
expected
she
rose
magnificently
to
the
occasion
you
leave
it
to
us
gipsies
she
assured
them
bless
you
we
used
to
this
kind
of
job
there
a
lot
of
us
altogether
working
here
and
i
pass
the
word
on
there
be
scouts
this
evening
behind
nearly
every
hedge
and
if
any
german
comes
this
way
we
get
him
i
promise
you
you
keep
your
eye
on
that
vernon
we
may
want
a
signal
look
here
lady
come
to
the
back
of
that
shed
and
i
teach
you
the
gipsies
whistle
anybody
with
romany
blood
in
them
bound
to
answer
it
the
gipsy
whistle
was
a
peculiar
call
not
very
easy
to
imitate
raymonde
had
to
try
again
and
again
before
she
could
accomplish
it
to
her
instructress
satisfaction
at
last
however
she
had
it
perfectly
do
use
it
till
you
must
cautioned
her
confederate
but
if
we
hear
it
it
will
bring
the
lot
of
us
out
now
i
must
go
back
to
my
picking
or
the
agent
will
be
turning
me
off
and
i
must
rush
back
to
the
camp
declared
raymonde
remembering
that
miss
gibbs
who
had
stayed
with
the
invalid
would
expect
a
report
of
the
visit
to
the
telephone
the
excitement
of
the
german
letter
had
temporarily
banished
katherine
illness
from
her
thoughts
and
she
reproached
herself
for
her
unkindness
in
forgetting
her
friend
the
doctor
called
during
the
course
of
the
morning
and
after
examining
the
patient
pronounced
her
complaint
to
be
neither
measles
nor
anything
of
an
infectious
character
but
merely
a
rash
due
to
the
eating
of
too
many
strawberries
they
cause
violent
dyspepsia
in
some
people
he
remarked
i
will
make
up
a
bottle
of
medicine
if
you
can
send
anybody
over
on
a
bicycle
for
it
this
afternoon
you
must
eat
any
more
strawberries
young
lady
they
be
simply
poison
to
you
at
present
oh
yes
you
may
go
and
pick
them
the
occupation
will
do
you
no
harm
much
relieved
that
they
had
not
started
a
centre
of
infection
in
the
camp
katherine
and
miss
gibbs
returned
to
work
after
lunch
the
latter
issuing
special
instructions
to
her
girls
against
the
excessive
consumption
of
the
fruit
they
were
gathering
katherine
was
inclined
to
pose
as
an
interesting
invalid
and
to
claim
sympathy
but
the
general
feeling
of
her
schoolfellows
was
against
that
attitude
and
the
verdict
was
greedy
pig
serves
her
right
which
was
not
at
all
to
her
satisfaction
you
most
unkind
she
wailed
you
every
one
of
you
eaten
quite
as
many
strawberries
as
i
have
only
i
a
delicate
digestion
and
ca
stand
them
like
you
can
you
a
set
of
ostriches
i
believe
you
munch
turnips
if
you
were
sent
to
hoe
them
i
do
mind
what
you
say
so
there
as
six
drew
on
and
most
of
the
workers
were
handing
in
their
last
baskets
for
the
day
raymonde
and
aveline
kept
watchful
eyes
on
vernon
they
fully
expected
that
she
might
disappear
on
the
way
back
to
the
camp
so
without
making
their
purpose
apparent
they
shadowed
her
pretending
that
they
were
looking
for
flowers
in
the
hedge
they
hung
about
in
the
vicinity
of
her
tent
until
and
changed
their
seats
at
table
so
that
they
might
sit
nearer
to
her
in
the
marquee
when
the
meal
was
over
and
the
washing
up
and
water
carrying
finished
nearly
everybody
collected
for
an
amateur
concert
miss
hoyle
had
a
banjo
which
she
played
atrociously
out
of
tune
but
on
which
she
nevertheless
strummed
accompaniments
while
the
rest
roared
out
little
grey
home
in
the
west
the
long
long
trail
and
other
popular
songs
it
was
certainly
not
classical
music
but
it
was
amusing
and
as
everybody
joined
in
the
choruses
the
company
consisted
entirely
of
performers
with
no
audience
except
the
cows
in
the
adjacent
pasture
even
vernon
was
singing
though
with
an
inscrutable
look
in
her
grey
eyes
hardly
suggestive
of
enjoyment
she
doing
it
as
a
blind
whispered
raymonde
to
aveline
do
let
her
out
of
your
sight
for
a
single
moment
when
the
fun
was
at
its
height
and
everybody
seemed
fully
occupied
with
ragtimes
two
pairs
of
watchful
eyes
noticed
vernon
slip
quietly
away
in
the
direction
of
her
tent
she
went
inside
for
a
moment
then
coming
out
again
with
a
parcel
in
her
hand
walked
rapidly
towards
a
stile
that
led
into
the
fields
raymonde
and
aveline
allowed
her
to
reach
the
other
side
of
it
then
flew
like
the
wind
to
a
gap
in
the
hedge
through
which
they
could
see
into
the
next
meadow
she
was
walking
along
the
path
among
the
hay
in
the
direction
of
the
wood
and
was
no
doubt
congratulating
herself
upon
getting
rid
of
her
so
easily
there
was
nothing
at
all
unusual
in
the
fact
of
her
taking
a
stroll
many
of
the
workers
did
so
in
the
evenings
though
they
generally
went
two
or
three
together
had
it
not
been
for
the
letter
she
had
read
at
the
post
office
raymonde
suspicions
would
probably
never
have
been
aroused
the
two
girls
crossed
the
stile
and
began
to
follow
vernon
as
if
they
too
were
merely
enjoying
an
ordinary
walk
leaving
a
considerable
distance
between
her
and
themselves
she
turned
round
once
but
as
they
were
in
the
shadow
of
the
hedge
she
did
not
see
them
it
was
a
more
difficult
business
to
track
her
through
the
wood
the
light
was
waning
fast
here
and
in
her
brown
costume
she
was
sometimes
almost
indistinguishable
among
the
and
bushes
that
she
was
going
to
some
specially
arranged
they
were
certain
using
infinite
caution
they
followed
her
towards
the
middle
of
the
wood
she
paused
looked
round
and
seeing
nobody
for
the
girls
were
hidden
behind
a
tangle
of
bramble
she
stood
still
and
called
softly
there
was
no
answer
she
called
again
waited
a
few
moments
and
then
began
to
walk
farther
on
into
the
wood
she
was
at
a
point
where
two
paths
divided
and
she
chose
the
one
to
the
right
ave
whispered
raymonde
we
must
spread
ourselves
out
evidently
looking
for
and
he
may
be
on
the
other
path
we
must
miss
him
you
follow
her
and
i
take
the
way
to
the
left
aveline
nodded
and
obeyed
she
did
not
much
relish
going
alone
but
she
had
a
profound
respect
for
her
chum
judgment
the
path
which
raymonde
had
chosen
was
the
narrower
and
more
overgrown
she
stole
along
listening
and
watching
after
a
few
hundred
yards
she
came
to
an
ancient
the
trunk
of
which
worn
with
age
was
no
more
than
a
hollow
shell
it
would
be
perfectly
possible
for
anyone
to
hide
here
an
idea
occurred
to
her
venturesome
indeed
but
certainly
feasible
raymonde
was
not
a
girl
to
stop
and
consider
risks
if
an
escaped
german
were
in
the
wood
it
was
her
duty
to
her
king
and
country
to
try
to
effect
his
arrest
all
her
patriotism
rose
within
her
and
though
her
heart
thumped
rather
loudly
she
told
herself
that
she
was
not
afraid
going
into
the
middle
of
the
path
she
called
as
vernon
had
done
then
dived
into
the
shelter
of
the
hollow
tree
if
he
anywhere
near
here
that
bring
him
she
thought
for
a
moment
all
was
silence
then
came
a
crashing
among
the
bushes
and
an
answering
call
someone
was
coming
in
the
direction
of
the
peeping
from
her
raymonde
could
just
distinguish
a
figure
advancing
through
the
gathering
darkness
of
the
wood
then
awful
fear
fell
upon
her
suppose
he
were
to
look
inside
the
hollow
tree
and
find
her
he
was
a
german
and
a
desperate
man
she
was
a
girl
and
alone
why
oh
why
had
she
sent
aveline
away
he
would
be
quite
capable
of
murdering
her
in
that
moment
of
agony
she
bitterly
repented
her
folly
to
be
sure
there
were
the
gipsies
but
she
was
not
certain
whether
they
were
really
within
call
and
would
come
quickly
in
answer
to
her
signal
the
footsteps
drew
nearer
they
were
almost
at
the
tree
she
shrank
to
the
farthest
corner
trusting
that
in
the
darkness
her
brown
serge
school
costume
might
escape
notice
just
at
that
moment
another
cautious
shout
sounded
through
the
wood
the
footsteps
stopped
so
near
to
her
tree
that
raymonde
could
see
the
flap
of
a
coat
through
the
opening
then
they
turned
and
went
in
the
direction
of
the
voice
raymonde
drew
a
long
breath
of
intense
relief
and
peeped
out
the
man
was
tacking
down
a
little
incline
towards
the
brook
guided
by
a
further
call
i
seen
he
here
and
i
know
he
going
down
there
to
meet
her
thought
raymonde
it
time
for
me
to
act
she
slipped
from
the
tree
ran
nearer
to
the
edge
of
the
wood
and
gave
the
peculiar
whistle
which
the
romany
woman
had
taught
her
its
effect
was
immediate
within
ten
seconds
one
of
the
gipsy
boys
ran
up
to
her
and
she
told
him
briefly
what
had
occurred
i
pass
the
signal
on
he
replied
there
a
ring
of
us
all
round
the
wood
we
wo
let
him
go
you
bet
he
gave
a
low
cry
like
the
hooting
of
an
owl
which
was
at
once
answered
from
the
right
and
the
left
that
means
the
ring
he
explained
we
all
sorts
of
calls
that
we
understand
and
talk
to
each
other
by
when
we
in
the
woods
they
all
be
moving
on
now
the
gipsy
boy
went
forward
and
raymonde
with
her
heart
again
thumping
wildly
followed
at
a
little
distance
this
was
indeed
an
adventure
she
wondered
where
aveline
was
and
if
she
were
equally
frightened
she
wished
she
had
not
left
her
friend
alone
the
gipsies
well
versed
in
walked
as
silently
as
hunters
stalking
a
buck
she
would
not
have
known
they
were
within
a
mile
of
her
had
she
not
been
told
her
boy
guide
had
vanished
temporarily
among
the
bushes
she
stood
still
for
a
few
minutes
uncertain
what
to
do
then
there
was
a
shout
and
a
sound
of
running
footsteps
crashing
through
the
bushes
excited
voices
called
and
presently
between
the
trees
came
five
or
six
of
the
gipsies
hauling
a
man
whose
arms
they
had
already
bound
with
a
rope
the
romany
woman
herself
as
strong
as
any
man
was
helping
with
apparent
gusto
when
she
saw
raymonde
she
ran
to
her
we
got
him
right
enough
lady
she
exclaimed
triumphantly
they
going
to
take
him
to
the
farm
and
borrow
a
trap
to
take
him
to
the
jail
at
ledcombe
we
nabbed
him
by
the
brook
as
neat
as
anything
the
other
young
lady
over
there
aveline
aveline
called
raymonde
rushing
in
pursuit
of
her
friend
the
two
girls
clung
to
each
other
eagerly
they
were
both
thoroughly
frightened
let
go
back
to
the
camp
gasped
aveline
i
dare
stay
here
any
longer
oh
i
was
terrified
when
you
left
me
what
become
of
mrs
vernon
asked
raymonde
aveline
did
not
know
in
the
hullabaloo
of
the
pursuit
the
woman
had
been
allowed
to
escape
she
had
the
wisdom
not
to
return
to
the
camp
and
was
indeed
never
seen
again
in
the
neighbourhood
great
was
the
excitement
at
the
farm
when
the
gipsies
brought
in
the
german
rivers
himself
undertook
to
drive
them
and
their
prisoner
to
the
jail
raymonde
and
aveline
had
a
thrilling
story
to
tell
in
the
marquee
that
night
where
everybody
collected
to
hear
the
wonderful
experience
those
who
had
already
gone
to
their
tents
donning
and
coming
to
join
the
interested
audience
miss
gibbs
seemed
divided
between
a
sense
of
her
duty
as
a
schoolmistress
to
scold
her
pupils
for
undertaking
such
an
extremely
wild
proceeding
and
a
glow
of
pride
that
her
girls
had
actually
succeeded
in
effecting
the
capture
of
an
escaped
enemy
on
the
whole
pride
and
patriotism
prevailed
and
the
pair
were
let
off
with
only
a
caution
against
madcap
adventures
raymonde
found
herself
the
idol
of
the
gipsies
at
the
strawberry
gardens
next
day
we
to
have
a
big
reward
lady
for
copping
that
german
said
the
romany
woman
it
buy
us
a
new
horse
for
our
caravan
will
you
please
accept
this
basket
from
us
we
wish
we
anything
better
to
offer
you
i
teach
you
three
words
of
romany
let
me
whisper
you
forget
them
and
if
you
ever
in
trouble
and
want
help
from
the
gipsies
you
only
to
say
those
words
to
them
and
they
give
their
last
drop
of
blood
for
you
but
do
tell
anybody
else
lady
the
words
are
only
for
you
what
was
she
saying
to
you
asked
morvyth
curiously
i
ca
tell
you
replied
raymonde
it
a
secret
illustration
raymonde
drew
a
long
breath
of
intense
relief
and
peeped
out
chapter
xiii
camp
hospitality
the
brief
visit
at
the
camp
was
vanishing
with
almost
incredible
rapidity
the
week
would
finish
on
saturday
but
miss
gibbs
had
decided
to
stay
till
monday
morning
so
as
to
put
in
the
full
period
of
work
on
saturday
afternoon
sunday
was
of
course
a
holiday
and
the
pickers
enjoyed
a
rest
those
who
liked
went
to
the
little
church
in
shipley
village
the
clergyman
of
which
also
held
an
outdoor
service
in
the
stackyard
at
the
farm
for
all
whom
he
could
persuade
to
come
in
the
afternoon
the
members
of
the
camp
gave
themselves
up
to
hospitality
they
had
small
and
select
private
and
invited
each
other
the
hostesses
generally
being
at
home
in
some
cosy
spot
beneath
a
tree
or
under
the
shelter
of
a
hedge
where
the
alfresco
repast
was
spread
forth
each
guest
bringing
her
own
mug
and
plate
raymonde
morvyth
katherine
and
aveline
were
the
recipients
of
a
very
special
invitation
and
miss
gibbs
assenting
they
accepted
it
with
glee
miss
lowe
the
artist
with
whom
they
had
struck
up
a
friendship
had
removed
on
friday
from
the
camp
to
lodgings
at
an
old
farm
near
the
village
and
she
had
asked
her
four
acquaintances
to
come
for
early
dinner
and
tea
so
that
they
might
spend
the
afternoon
with
her
miss
lowe
was
an
interesting
personality
she
sketched
beautifully
and
had
shown
the
girls
a
few
charming
specimens
of
her
work
she
had
been
painting
in
the
neighbourhood
for
some
weeks
before
the
strawberry
picking
began
and
had
many
quaint
accounts
to
give
of
her
experiences
her
quarters
in
the
village
had
been
decidedly
uncomfortable
and
it
seemed
very
uncertain
whether
the
rooms
she
had
engaged
at
the
farm
would
turn
out
to
be
any
improvement
you
have
to
take
if
you
come
to
dinner
with
me
she
announced
to
her
guests
i
do
believe
my
landlady
has
even
the
most
elementary
notions
of
cooking
the
meal
will
probably
be
a
surprise
we
sha
mind
that
the
girls
assured
her
miss
lowe
had
chosen
her
lodgings
more
for
the
sake
of
the
picturesque
than
for
creature
comforts
the
was
an
extremely
ancient
building
and
its
very
dilapidation
rendered
it
a
more
suitable
subject
for
her
brush
it
consisted
of
a
front
portion
and
a
much
older
part
at
the
back
the
two
being
really
separate
blocks
connected
by
a
large
central
hall
this
hall
which
measured
about
twenty
feet
square
and
thirty
feet
in
height
must
at
one
time
have
belonged
to
a
family
of
some
pretensions
the
walls
to
a
height
of
fifteen
feet
were
covered
with
splendid
oak
panelling
grey
with
neglect
and
above
that
were
ornamented
with
plaster
designs
in
lions
unicorns
wild
boars
stags
and
other
heraldic
devices
a
form
of
decoration
which
was
also
continued
over
the
ceiling
the
back
part
of
the
house
was
evidently
the
older
the
same
beautiful
was
to
be
seen
both
in
the
bedrooms
and
kitchen
together
with
fine
black
oak
beams
there
was
a
winding
stair
to
the
upper
story
with
narrow
windows
that
suggested
a
castle
and
that
dull
dim
soft
light
about
everything
which
only
seems
reflected
from
ancient
walls
the
front
portion
consisted
of
two
great
one
of
which
was
empty
while
the
other
had
been
arranged
for
the
accommodation
of
visitors
neither
walls
nor
had
been
touched
with
paint
for
half
a
century
and
they
were
sadly
in
need
of
attention
the
house
was
the
property
of
an
old
miser
who
refused
to
spend
a
penny
on
repairs
and
every
year
things
went
on
from
bad
to
worse
the
woodwork
of
the
wide
old
staircase
was
rotting
away
most
of
the
doors
were
off
their
hinges
and
the
rain
came
through
several
spots
in
the
roof
like
many
another
fine
mansion
it
had
descended
from
hall
to
and
showed
now
but
faded
relics
of
its
former
grandeur
the
farmer
and
his
family
lived
entirely
in
the
back
premises
and
the
whole
of
the
front
was
given
up
to
their
lodgers
i
should
like
to
sleep
here
alone
said
morvyth
as
miss
lowe
acted
cicerone
and
showed
them
through
the
house
these
long
gloomy
eerie
corridors
give
me
the
shivers
i
felt
the
same
admitted
their
friend
so
i
persuaded
miss
barton
to
join
me
she
as
mad
on
the
antique
as
i
am
and
together
we
enjoy
ourselves
immensely
though
we
should
each
feel
spooky
alone
our
first
business
last
night
was
to
turn
five
bats
out
of
our
bedroom
there
an
open
in
the
ceiling
of
the
landing
and
a
whole
colony
of
them
seem
to
be
established
up
there
they
flit
up
and
down
the
stairs
at
dusk
one
has
to
sacrifice
comfort
to
the
picturesque
i
think
i
begin
to
have
just
a
glimmer
of
an
understanding
why
some
people
prefer
new
houses
to
old
both
miss
lowe
and
miss
barton
certainly
found
their
romantic
proclivities
came
into
collision
with
their
preconceived
ideas
of
the
fitness
of
things
marsden
their
landlady
was
a
kind
soul
who
did
her
best
but
she
had
all
her
farm
work
and
a
large
family
of
children
to
cope
with
so
it
was
small
wonder
that
cobwebs
hung
in
the
passages
and
the
dust
lay
thick
and
untouched
it
is
sometimes
wiser
not
to
see
behind
the
scenes
in
country
rooms
miss
barton
had
set
up
her
easel
in
the
great
hall
and
absolutely
revelled
in
painting
the
grey
oak
and
nevertheless
she
had
a
tale
of
woe
to
unfold
they
use
the
place
as
a
dairy
she
explained
and
they
keep
the
milk
in
large
uncovered
earthenware
pots
first
i
found
the
cat
was
lapping
away
at
it
and
i
jumped
up
and
scared
it
off
and
then
the
dog
strayed
in
and
began
to
help
itself
and
i
had
to
rush
again
and
chase
it
away
then
the
unwashed
baby
still
in
its
dirty
little
brought
a
mug
and
kept
dipping
it
into
the
pot
to
get
drinks
we
going
to
take
a
jug
into
the
field
at
this
afternoon
and
ensure
our
particular
portion
straight
from
the
cow
i
glad
to
hear
it
said
morvyth
looking
considerably
relieved
perhaps
it
as
well
we
do
see
most
foodstuffs
in
the
making
moralized
aveline
decidedly
is
there
a
story
of
a
barrel
of
treacle
and
a
little
nigger
baby
being
found
at
the
bottom
and
an
attendant
who
fell
by
mistake
into
the
sausage
machine
added
miss
lowe
laughing
i
suppose
one
ought
to
be
judiciously
blind
if
one
is
to
preserve
one
peace
of
mind
one
may
shut
one
eyes
but
one
ca
do
away
with
one
nose
persisted
miss
barton
there
was
the
most
horrible
and
peculiar
and
objectionable
odour
in
the
hall
yesterday
morning
all
the
time
i
was
painting
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
a
rat
must
have
died
recently
behind
the
panelling
then
marsden
came
in
with
some
and
she
raised
a
lid
from
a
big
pot
close
to
where
i
was
sitting
what
do
you
think
was
inside
twelve
pounds
of
beef
that
she
had
put
down
to
pickle
i
hinted
that
it
was
rather
high
but
she
did
seem
to
perceive
it
in
the
least
she
ca
have
the
slightest
vestige
of
a
nose
perhaps
like
some
tribes
of
africans
she
prefers
her
meat
gamey
do
look
so
alarmed
you
poor
girls
it
not
going
to
appear
on
our
table
for
dinner
i
ordered
a
fowl
which
was
alive
only
a
couple
of
hours
ago
for
i
saw
the
children
assisting
to
chase
it
wildly
round
the
yard
and
catch
it
put
in
miss
barton
we
warned
you
when
we
invited
you
not
to
expect
too
much
marsden
training
in
the
domestic
arts
had
evidently
been
defective
and
her
cooking
was
decidedly
eccentric
the
fowl
turned
up
at
table
plucked
certainly
but
looking
very
pale
and
an√¶mic
with
its
long
untrussed
legs
sticking
helplessly
out
before
it
it
was
such
an
absurd
object
that
as
soon
as
the
landlady
had
departed
from
the
room
the
company
exploded
how
am
i
to
carve
the
wretched
thing
shrieked
miss
lowe
i
hardly
know
where
its
wings
are
i
never
before
seen
a
chicken
served
absolutely
i
expect
it
to
rise
up
and
walk
hinnied
miss
barton
it
seems
hardly
decent
to
have
left
its
claws
on
look
at
the
sauce
simply
bread
and
milk
oh
for
the
fleshpots
of
egypt
a
pudding
which
followed
proved
equally
astonishing
miss
lowe
had
suggested
that
an
egg
would
be
an
improvement
in
its
composition
and
behold
when
it
made
its
appearance
there
was
an
egg
neatly
poached
in
the
middle
the
giggling
guests
rather
enjoyed
the
episode
than
otherwise
they
had
come
to
be
entertained
and
they
certainly
found
plenty
to
amuse
them
especially
in
the
humorous
attitude
with
which
their
hostesses
viewed
all
the
little
inconveniences
perhaps
we
shall
do
better
at
said
miss
barton
hopefully
marsden
surely
ca
go
very
wrong
there
we
going
to
walk
to
the
woods
this
afternoon
i
bespoken
jenny
the
fourth
child
as
a
guide
she
the
most
quaintly
fascinating
person
i
hope
she
wo
be
long
we
waiting
for
her
now
the
girls
were
all
impatience
to
start
for
the
woods
so
as
their
little
guide
was
already
late
miss
barton
went
to
the
kitchen
in
search
of
her
and
found
her
concluding
a
somewhat
lengthy
toilet
with
the
assistance
of
her
family
the
choicest
possessions
of
several
members
in
assorted
sizes
seemed
to
have
been
commandeered
and
she
was
finally
turned
out
in
a
red
serge
dress
a
black
jacket
much
too
large
a
feather
boa
and
a
pair
of
woollen
gloves
which
considering
that
it
was
quite
a
hot
day
was
rank
cruelty
though
true
daughter
of
eve
as
she
was
she
seemed
so
pleased
with
her
appearance
that
nothing
would
induce
her
to
pull
off
her
suffocating
grandeur
she
was
not
at
all
shy
and
very
for
her
seven
years
the
girls
found
her
conversation
most
entertaining
as
they
walked
along
she
is
absolutely
refreshing
giggled
raymonde
the
way
she
shakes
out
her
skirts
and
manoeuvres
the
sleeves
of
the
big
jacket
is
perfectly
lovely
she
ought
to
be
a
mannikin
when
she
grows
up
and
try
on
coats
and
mantles
in
shops
would
she
just
enjoy
it
to
jenny
an
expedition
with
six
ladies
was
apparently
the
opportunity
of
a
lifetime
and
she
was
determined
to
make
the
most
of
it
she
volunteered
to
recite
and
wound
out
a
long
poem
in
such
a
rapid
breathless
monotone
that
it
was
hardly
possible
to
distinguish
a
word
the
party
politely
expressed
gratitude
whereupon
she
announced
say
it
for
you
again
and
plunged
at
once
into
an
encore
for
pity
sake
stop
her
i
getting
hysterical
gurgled
morvyth
she
like
a
gramophone
record
that
rather
blurred
and
has
been
set
too
fast
thank
goodness
here
the
wood
she
ca
recite
while
she
climbing
that
stile
everybody
decided
that
the
wood
was
worth
the
walk
they
spent
a
delicious
afternoon
lying
under
the
tall
straight
pines
with
the
needles
for
a
bed
watching
the
delicate
and
illusive
effects
of
light
filtering
among
the
shimmering
leaves
of
birches
i
feel
as
if
i
ought
to
be
picking
something
laughed
katherine
throwing
pine
cones
at
raymonde
if
i
live
to
be
a
hundred
never
forget
this
business
one
got
to
do
it
automatically
you
know
the
story
do
you
of
the
old
man
who
described
himself
in
the
census
as
a
picker
said
miss
barton
when
he
was
asked
to
explain
he
said
in
june
i
picks
strawberries
and
then
i
picks
beans
and
then
i
picks
hops
then
when
them
over
i
picks
pockets
and
then
i
gets
copped
and
sent
to
quod
and
picks
oakum
i
should
wonder
if
some
of
your
gipsy
friends
raymonde
could
boast
of
a
similar
record
i
do
care
they
declared
raymonde
sticking
up
for
the
tribe
who
wants
tea
said
miss
lowe
we
asked
miss
nelson
and
miss
porter
from
the
camp
and
if
we
do
hurry
back
at
once
we
shall
find
them
waiting
for
us
when
we
return
and
slanging
us
for
being
rude
come
along
miss
lowe
had
casually
informed
marsden
that
she
expected
a
few
friends
to
tea
but
had
not
mentioned
anything
about
special
preparation
thinking
that
they
would
carry
the
cups
and
saucers
into
the
garden
and
have
it
under
the
trees
little
did
they
know
the
surprise
their
enterprising
landlady
had
in
store
for
them
when
they
arrived
at
the
farm
they
found
her
dressed
in
her
best
attire
waiting
at
the
door
to
receive
them
and
she
proudly
ushered
them
into
the
where
she
had
spread
forth
a
meal
such
as
might
be
set
before
a
particularly
hungry
assemblage
of
sunday
school
scholars
a
large
ham
not
yet
quite
cold
adorned
one
end
of
the
table
and
a
big
the
other
while
down
the
centre
were
seven
round
each
measuring
about
seven
inches
in
diameter
the
cruets
had
been
put
in
the
middle
of
the
table
instead
of
miss
barton
bowl
of
flowers
and
there
were
several
substantial
platefuls
of
it
was
an
extremely
warm
afternoon
and
even
to
appetites
the
sight
of
such
plenty
at
was
appalling
miss
lowe
convulsed
apologies
sent
the
visitors
into
explosions
look
at
the
tarts
choked
miss
barton
they
all
made
with
jam
there
one
apiece
for
us
counting
the
and
the
is
half
an
inch
thick
who
take
a
slice
of
lukewarm
ham
oh
it
positively
painful
to
laugh
so
hard
i
never
saw
such
a
in
my
life
we
certainly
ca
consume
all
these
echoed
miss
lowe
the
children
must
eat
up
some
of
them
for
supper
it
will
take
days
to
get
through
such
a
larderful
for
once
they
be
satiated
with
well
i
suppose
it
an
ill
wind
that
blows
nobody
good
still
if
the
baby
comes
to
an
untimely
end
through
acute
dyspepsia
i
sha
be
in
the
least
surprised
marsden
seemed
determined
to
entertain
her
guests
and
had
yet
another
surprise
in
store
for
them
she
beckoned
them
into
a
little
private
parlour
of
her
own
and
showed
them
the
paintings
of
her
eldest
boy
a
youth
of
eighteen
who
she
proudly
assured
them
had
never
had
a
drawing
lesson
in
his
life
it
was
not
difficult
to
believe
her
for
the
specimens
were
so
funny
that
the
spectators
could
hardly
keep
their
faces
straight
horses
with
about
as
much
shape
as
those
in
a
child
noah
ark
figures
resembling
dutch
dolls
in
rigidity
flowers
daubed
on
with
the
crudest
colours
and
the
final
effort
a
view
of
the
village
consisting
chiefly
of
tiled
roofs
and
in
lurid
red
and
black
no
doubt
it
has
afforded
him
the
supremest
delight
whispered
miss
lowe
to
miss
barton
and
it
evidently
a
subject
of
the
utmost
satisfaction
to
his
mother
so
i
wo
make
carping
criticisms
but
take
it
as
a
moral
for
the
necessity
of
due
humility
over
one
own
productions
perhaps
mine
would
be
as
diverting
to
an
academician
as
his
are
to
me
in
the
same
room
marsden
showed
her
visitors
a
mysterious
black
with
age
and
hideous
beyond
compare
which
she
informed
them
was
an
original
portrait
of
nell
gwynn
she
supposed
it
to
be
immensely
valuable
and
was
keeping
it
safe
until
prices
rose
a
little
higher
still
after
the
war
when
she
had
hopes
of
launching
it
on
the
auction
rooms
in
london
and
realizing
a
sum
that
would
make
her
family
fortune
an
ambition
she
never
realize
in
this
wide
world
said
miss
barton
afterwards
for
the
thing
is
absolutely
not
genuine
it
not
the
right
period
for
nell
gwynn
and
it
so
atrociously
badly
painted
that
it
obviously
the
work
of
some
village
artist
she
in
for
a
big
disappointment
some
day
poor
woman
i
had
the
heart
to
squash
her
when
she
seemed
so
proud
of
it
especially
as
she
was
still
a
little
huffy
that
we
had
consumed
her
tarts
though
physically
they
were
rather
weary
the
girls
were
sorry
when
their
week
strawberry
picking
came
to
an
end
it
was
found
that
when
their
canteen
bills
had
been
paid
and
railway
fares
subtracted
they
had
each
earned
on
an
average
a
little
over
five
shillings
some
who
were
quicker
pickers
exceeding
that
amount
and
others
falling
below
they
decided
to
pool
the
general
proceeds
and
present
the
sum
cleared
to
the
hospital
for
disabled
soldiers
as
their
bit
towards
their
country
they
went
back
to
school
feeling
highly
patriotic
and
burning
to
boast
of
their
experiences
to
those
slackers
who
had
chosen
the
parental
roof
for
their
holidays
i
have
loved
it
protested
fauvette
but
i
really
did
have
a
very
nice
time
at
home
my
cousin
was
back
on
leave
he
in
the
flying
corps
and
he
six
feet
three
in
his
stockings
and
well
i
got
his
photo
upstairs
if
you
like
to
look
at
it
oh
we
all
accustomed
to
gipsies
and
poachers
now
and
do
think
anything
of
airmen
returned
morvyth
nonchalantly
she
was
apt
to
sit
on
fauvette
you
should
see
my
snapshots
of
the
strawberry
pickers
and
mine
broke
in
cynthia
greene
by
the
by
i
wrote
my
name
and
school
address
on
a
card
and
packed
it
inside
one
of
my
strawberry
baskets
i
put
on
it
the
finder
kindly
write
to
a
girl
who
feels
lonely
cynthia
you
did
exploded
the
others
i
did
crystal
why
should
i
lonely
soldiers
beg
for
letters
and
it
as
lonely
at
school
as
in
barracks
any
day
at
least
i
find
it
so
suppose
somebody
takes
you
at
your
word
and
sends
an
answer
i
heartily
and
sincerely
hope
somebody
will
it
would
be
absolutely
topping
chapter
xiv
concerns
cynthia
look
here
said
hermie
to
raymonde
two
days
later
when
the
latter
was
helping
the
monitress
to
put
away
the
tools
the
matter
with
cynthia
greene
she
behaving
in
the
most
idiotic
fashion
goes
mincing
about
the
school
and
sighing
and
even
mopping
her
eyes
when
she
thinks
anybody
looking
at
her
what
she
posing
about
now
she
says
she
feels
lonely
and
and
at
least
that
what
she
wrote
inside
her
strawberry
basket
volunteered
raymonde
what
in
the
name
of
the
muses
do
you
mean
raymonde
explained
the
monitress
listened
aghast
well
i
call
that
the
limit
she
exploded
the
little
monkey
why
gibbie
would
slay
her
if
she
knew
such
an
atrociously
cheeky
unladylike
thing
to
do
and
putting
her
address
here
at
the
grange
bringing
discredit
on
the
school
i
do
suppose
whoever
finds
it
will
take
any
notice
she
hoping
for
an
answer
said
raymonde
i
believe
she
just
yearning
to
be
mixed
up
in
a
love
affair
at
thirteen
scoffed
hermie
the
silly
young
blighter
i
like
to
shake
her
if
you
do
she
be
rather
pleased
than
otherwise
returned
raymonde
she
pose
as
a
martyr
then
and
say
the
world
is
unsympathetic
i
beginning
to
know
cynthia
greene
i
believe
you
right
said
the
monitress
thoughtfully
sentiment
was
not
encouraged
at
the
grange
miss
beasley
very
rightly
thought
that
girls
should
keep
their
childhood
as
long
as
possible
and
that
premature
love
affairs
wiped
the
bloom
off
genuine
later
experiences
the
school
in
general
assumed
the
attitude
of
scoffing
at
romance
except
in
the
pages
of
the
library
books
it
was
not
considered
good
form
to
allude
to
it
tennis
or
hockey
was
a
more
popular
topic
so
cynthia
trying
to
run
the
sentimental
business
mused
hermie
it
spread
if
we
do
take
care
it
as
infectious
as
measles
i
not
going
to
have
all
those
juniors
wandering
about
the
garden
reading
poetry
instead
of
practising
their
cricket
it
not
good
enough
yet
it
difficult
for
a
monitress
to
interfere
as
you
say
cynthia
would
take
a
melancholy
pride
in
being
persecuted
look
here
raymonde
you
a
young
blighter
yourself
sometimes
but
you
do
go
in
for
this
kind
of
rubbish
ca
you
think
of
some
plan
to
nip
the
thing
in
the
bud
before
it
goes
further
you
generally
inventive
enough
if
i
might
have
a
free
hand
for
a
day
or
two
i
might
manage
something
admitted
raymonde
with
caution
i
tell
the
other
monitresses
to
let
you
alone
i
do
mind
how
you
contrive
it
as
long
as
you
knock
the
nonsense
out
of
the
juniors
cynthia
greene
of
all
people
too
the
former
ornament
of
the
poplars
who
used
to
keep
up
the
tone
so
she
says
and
set
an
example
to
the
rest
what
is
she
coming
to
i
should
think
they
want
that
bracelet
back
if
they
knew
the
mystic
seven
had
a
special
committee
meeting
before
tea
and
pledged
one
another
to
utmost
secrecy
the
result
of
their
confabulations
seemed
satisfactory
to
themselves
for
they
parted
chuckling
the
next
morning
when
cynthia
greene
went
to
her
desk
to
take
out
a
lesson
book
she
found
inside
a
letter
addressed
to
herself
she
opened
it
in
a
whirl
of
excitement
it
was
written
in
a
slanting
backward
kind
of
hand
with
a
very
thick
pen
its
contents
ran
thus
dear
miss
cynthia
being
the
fortunate
recipient
of
the
card
placed
in
a
strawberry
basket
and
bearing
your
name
i
am
venturing
to
answer
it
i
too
am
lonely
and
long
for
friendship
i
admire
blue
eyes
and
fair
hair
i
myself
am
dark
i
should
like
immensely
to
meet
you
could
you
possibly
be
at
the
side
gate
of
your
garden
shortly
after
seven
this
evening
i
shall
arrive
by
motor
and
walk
past
on
the
chance
of
seeing
you
yours
respectfully
but
devotedly
algernon
augustus
fitzmaurice
the
conduct
of
cynthia
during
the
course
of
the
day
was
extraordinary
she
exhibited
a
mixture
of
and
fluttering
anticipation
that
was
highly
puzzling
to
her
companions
she
refused
to
explain
but
dropped
sufficient
hints
to
arouse
interest
it
was
presently
whispered
among
the
juniors
that
cynthia
had
received
a
from
somebody
highly
distinguished
and
aristocratic
did
it
come
by
post
asked
joan
butler
no
of
course
not
gibbie
would
never
have
given
it
to
her
if
it
had
cynthia
found
it
inside
her
desk
she
does
know
who
put
it
there
it
most
mysterious
for
the
day
cynthia
was
a
heroine
of
romance
among
her
form
she
played
the
part
admirably
wearing
an
abstracted
expression
in
her
blue
eyes
and
starting
when
spoken
to
as
if
aroused
from
daydreams
she
mentioned
casually
that
she
believed
the
family
of
fitzmaurice
to
be
an
extremely
ancient
one
and
that
its
members
were
mentioned
in
the
as
there
was
no
copy
of
that
volume
in
the
school
library
nobody
could
contradict
her
and
her
audience
murmured
interested
acquiescence
when
asked
whether
they
preferred
the
name
of
algernon
or
augustus
their
opinions
were
divided
at
first
the
juniors
were
sympathetic
but
by
the
end
of
the
afternoon
the
goddess
of
envy
began
to
rear
her
head
in
their
midst
manner
had
progressed
during
the
day
to
a
point
of
patronage
that
was
distinctly
aggravating
she
openly
pitied
girls
who
did
not
receive
private
letters
and
spoke
of
early
engagements
as
highly
desirable
she
missed
two
catches
when
fielding
at
cricket
being
employed
in
staring
sentimentally
at
the
sky
instead
of
watching
for
the
ball
buck
up
you
silly
idiot
ca
you
you
a
disgrace
to
the
school
snarled
nora
fawcitt
furiously
cynthia
sighed
gently
with
the
air
of
and
twisted
the
ends
of
her
hair
into
ringlets
after
tea
in
defiance
of
all
school
traditions
she
changed
her
dress
and
put
on
her
best
slippers
she
appeared
in
the
schoolroom
with
a
bunch
of
pansies
pinned
into
her
belt
preparation
was
from
six
to
seven
and
was
supposed
to
be
a
period
of
strenuous
mental
application
that
evening
however
cynthia
made
little
progress
with
her
latin
exercise
or
the
wars
of
the
roses
her
form
mates
looking
up
in
the
intervals
of
conning
their
textbooks
noted
her
sitting
with
idle
pen
gazing
raptly
into
space
or
glancing
anxiously
at
the
clock
though
she
had
not
confided
the
details
of
her
secret
her
companions
felt
that
something
was
going
to
happen
romance
was
in
the
atmosphere
several
of
the
juniors
found
themselves
wishing
that
clandestine
letters
had
appeared
in
their
desks
also
when
the
signal
for
dismissal
was
given
and
the
girls
trooped
from
the
schoolroom
cynthia
mysteriously
melted
away
somewhere
ardiune
walking
round
the
quad
five
minutes
later
accosted
joan
butler
janet
macpherson
nancie
page
and
isobel
parker
who
were
sitting
on
the
steps
of
the
sundial
reading
ella
wheeler
wilcox
of
if
you
like
a
little
sport
she
observed
come
along
with
me
you
may
bring
elsie
and
nora
if
you
can
find
them
i
promise
you
a
jinky
time
the
juniors
rose
readily
none
of
them
were
really
very
fond
of
reading
but
cynthia
had
lent
them
the
book
earlier
in
the
day
with
a
few
pages
turned
down
for
reference
they
flung
it
on
to
the
stone
step
with
scant
regard
for
its
white
cover
ardiune
led
her
recruits
hastily
to
the
back
drive
and
bade
them
hide
behind
the
thick
laurel
and
clipped
holly
bushes
that
backed
the
border
somebody
you
know
is
coming
to
keep
an
appointment
and
will
get
a
surprise
she
volunteered
they
had
hardly
taken
cover
when
cynthia
greene
appeared
strolling
along
the
drive
she
advanced
to
the
gate
leaned
her
elbow
on
it
and
posing
picturesquely
glanced
with
carelessness
up
and
down
the
back
lane
and
coughed
at
this
very
evident
signal
a
figure
emerged
from
the
shelter
of
the
opposite
bushes
and
strode
to
the
gate
the
juniors
gasped
they
had
all
taken
part
in
last
christmas
performance
and
they
easily
recognized
the
hat
long
coat
and
military
moustache
of
the
school
theatrical
wardrobe
the
only
masculine
garments
permitted
at
the
grange
cynthia
being
a
was
not
acquainted
with
them
her
agitated
eyes
merely
took
in
a
manly
vision
who
was
accosting
her
politely
though
without
removing
his
hat
have
i
the
pleasure
of
addressing
miss
cynthia
greene
asked
a
voice
cynthia
utterly
overcome
giggled
a
faint
assent
i
am
algernon
augustus
delighted
to
make
your
acquaintance
the
very
girl
i
always
longed
to
meet
i
ca
describe
my
loneliness
and
how
i
yearning
for
sympathy
fairest
loveliest
one
will
you
smile
upon
me
what
cynthia
might
have
answered
it
is
impossible
to
guess
but
at
that
critical
moment
the
hat
which
was
several
sizes
too
large
tilted
to
one
side
and
allowed
raymonde
hair
to
escape
down
her
back
cynthia
agitated
shriek
brought
a
crowd
of
witnesses
from
out
the
laurel
bushes
they
did
not
spare
their
victim
and
a
perfect
storm
of
chaff
descended
upon
her
did
it
go
to
meet
its
ownest
own
did
you
call
him
algernon
or
augustus
did
he
tell
you
his
family
pedigree
where
his
please
is
the
engagement
announced
yet
i
think
you
a
set
of
beasts
whimpered
cynthia
leaning
her
head
against
the
gate
and
sobbing
if
you
had
been
such
a
silly
idiot
you
would
have
been
taken
in
by
such
a
transparent
business
returned
raymonde
pulling
off
her
moustache
look
here
we
do
care
about
this
sickly
sort
of
stuff
so
the
sooner
you
drop
it
the
better
gracious
girl
turn
off
the
waterworks
be
thankful
gibbie
did
scent
out
your
romance
all
if
the
bumble
knew
you
put
that
card
inside
that
strawberry
basket
she
pack
up
your
boxes
and
send
you
home
by
the
next
train
crystal
clear
she
would
for
at
least
a
week
after
this
cynthia
greene
suffered
a
chastened
life
and
shed
enough
tears
to
make
her
a
conspicuous
item
in
her
laundry
bag
she
began
to
wish
that
the
names
of
augustus
and
algernon
could
be
expunged
from
the
english
language
her
form
mates
hinted
that
she
might
receive
a
present
of
on
her
next
birthday
if
she
missed
a
ball
at
tennis
or
slacked
a
little
at
cricket
somebody
was
sure
to
enquire
thinking
of
him
she
found
a
picture
of
two
attached
to
the
on
her
and
drawings
of
hearts
and
darts
were
scrawled
by
unknown
hands
inside
her
textbooks
moreover
she
lived
in
constant
dread
lest
somebody
should
have
really
found
the
card
inside
the
strawberry
basket
and
should
send
an
answer
by
post
which
would
fall
into
the
hands
of
miss
beasley
the
prospect
of
expulsion
from
the
school
haunted
her
fortunately
for
her
nobody
troubled
to
notice
her
request
for
correspondence
the
basket
of
strawberries
having
probably
found
its
way
to
some
snuffy
individual
at
a
greengrocer
stall
who
took
no
interest
in
the
loneliness
of
damsels
as
for
her
volume
of
of
hermie
confiscated
it
until
the
end
of
the
term
and
recommended
a
of
instead
chapter
xv
on
the
river
miss
gibbs
was
fast
arriving
at
the
disappointing
conclusion
that
patriotism
costs
dearly
in
other
words
that
if
you
take
away
eighteen
girls
to
do
strawberry
picking
you
can
not
expect
them
immediately
on
their
return
to
settle
down
again
into
ordinary
routine
and
everyday
habits
an
atmosphere
of
camp
life
seemed
to
pervade
the
place
a
rollicking
spirit
that
was
not
at
all
in
accordance
with
miss
beasley
ideas
of
propriety
the
principal
who
had
never
altogether
approved
of
the
week
on
the
land
considered
that
the
school
was
demoralized
and
made
a
firm
effort
to
restore
discipline
the
monitresses
several
of
whom
had
been
guilty
of
whistling
in
the
passages
were
summoned
separately
for
private
interviews
in
the
study
whence
they
issued
somewhat
subdued
and
abashed
and
the
rank
and
file
by
means
of
punishment
lessons
and
fines
were
made
to
feel
a
wholesome
respect
for
the
iron
hand
of
the
law
miss
beasley
and
miss
gibbs
agreed
that
the
fifth
form
gave
the
largest
amount
of
trouble
it
was
here
that
most
of
the
mischief
fermented
and
fizzed
out
on
unexpected
occasions
at
present
the
mystic
seven
who
beforetime
had
offered
a
united
front
to
the
world
were
suffering
from
a
series
of
internal
quarrels
the
four
who
had
been
to
camp
assumed
an
air
of
superiority
over
the
three
who
had
not
which
led
to
unpleasantness
naturally
it
was
annoying
to
ardiune
valentine
and
fauvette
to
hear
constant
allusions
to
people
they
had
not
met
and
to
thrilling
experiences
in
which
they
had
not
participated
they
sulked
or
flew
out
as
the
occasion
might
be
i
believe
you
just
making
up
half
the
things
to
stuff
us
sneered
ardiune
indeed
we
not
flared
morvyth
every
word
we
told
you
is
gospel
truth
as
you
have
found
out
if
you
come
and
done
your
bit
for
your
country
mean
to
call
me
a
slacker
certainly
not
but
it
no
use
ostriching
about
things
you
either
went
and
picked
strawberries
or
you
did
you
know
i
was
allowed
to
go
you
mean
wretch
i
know
nothing
at
all
about
it
well
i
told
you
a
dozen
times
i
really
ca
listen
child
to
all
the
things
you
tell
me
then
i
sha
take
the
trouble
to
speak
to
you
again
with
ardiune
and
morvyth
on
terms
of
distant
iciness
valentine
and
katherine
constantly
sparring
over
trifles
fauvette
preserving
an
attitude
of
martyred
dignity
and
aveline
out
of
sheer
perversity
striking
up
a
friendship
with
maudie
heywood
matters
were
not
very
brisk
in
the
fifth
i
getting
just
about
fed
up
with
you
all
said
raymonde
irritably
i
never
saw
such
a
set
how
can
we
have
any
fun
when
everybody
grousing
with
everyone
else
for
goodness
sake
buck
up
i
a
blossomy
idea
in
my
head
yes
i
have
honest
signs
of
interest
manifested
themselves
on
the
faces
of
her
companions
raymonde
ideas
were
always
worth
listening
to
aveline
stopped
yawning
morvyth
desisted
from
kicking
her
geography
book
round
the
floor
and
fauvette
snapped
the
clasp
of
her
bracelet
and
sat
bolt
upright
we
hanging
upon
your
words
if
you
condescend
to
explain
o
queen
she
vouchsafed
raymonde
bowed
with
heels
together
and
hands
back
like
the
star
of
a
pierrot
troupe
do
mensh
glad
to
do
my
bit
she
replied
well
my
this
it
the
bumble
birthday
on
friday
as
if
every
girl
in
the
school
did
know
that
chafed
ardiune
impatiently
have
we
all
given
our
shillings
towards
her
present
ages
ago
really
ray
what
more
chestnuts
are
you
going
to
bring
forth
do
be
in
such
a
hurry
my
good
child
i
have
finished
yet
i
should
have
thought
you
could
have
trusted
your
grannie
by
this
time
my
remark
though
no
doubt
stale
was
only
one
of
those
preliminary
announcements
with
which
a
chairman
always
has
to
begin
like
to
see
so
many
bright
young
faces
collected
here
or
to
be
allowed
the
pleasure
of
saying
a
few
words
to
you
but
do
look
so
scared
i
not
going
to
prose
on
like
a
real
chairman
at
a
i
going
to
get
to
the
point
quick
being
the
birthday
if
you
grin
ardiune
i
pinch
you
being
as
i
have
observed
the
bumble
birthday
it
seems
only
right
and
fit
and
proper
that
the
other
bees
in
the
hive
should
buzz
in
sympathy
and
take
a
holiday
and
go
and
sip
nectar
let
us
copy
methods
copy
nature
by
all
means
sneered
ardiune
only
do
suggest
that
live
in
hives
or
you
be
a
little
out
of
it
oh
you
so
literal
it
only
for
the
sake
of
the
metaphor
i
talk
about
busy
bee
and
shining
hour
for
pity
sake
do
get
flowery
snapped
morvyth
doth
the
little
busy
bee
delight
to
bark
and
bite
she
gathers
honey
all
the
day
and
eats
it
up
at
night
misquoted
aveline
with
a
giggle
stop
frivolling
and
let
me
get
to
my
point
commanded
raymonde
for
the
third
time
let
me
remind
you
that
it
is
the
birthday
on
friday
and
that
it
only
decent
and
seemly
and
becoming
that
the
school
should
do
something
to
celebrate
so
joyous
an
occasion
stop
a
minute
interrupted
katherine
are
we
rejoicing
that
she
came
into
this
world
to
gladden
us
or
are
we
counting
one
more
year
off
towards
the
time
when
we
have
done
with
her
i
not
quite
clear
which
illustration
girl
turn
off
the
waterworks
whichever
you
like
so
long
as
you
look
congratulatory
and
and
and
all
the
rest
of
it
what
you
want
is
to
spread
the
butter
on
thick
then
when
an
atmosphere
of
smiles
ask
for
a
holiday
and
suggest
the
river
yes
my
children
i
said
the
river
you
did
misunderstand
me
i
speak
quite
clearly
whew
she
never
let
us
might
as
well
ask
for
the
moon
why
our
river
expedition
was
knocked
off
after
that
little
business
of
the
zepp
scare
all
the
more
reason
why
we
should
have
it
now
ray
you
the
limit
hope
i
am
if
it
means
getting
what
we
want
i
propose
a
deputation
to
the
bumble
to
state
that
the
gratitude
and
devotion
of
the
hive
can
only
work
itself
off
on
water
yes
ardiune
i
did
say
hive
my
sense
of
poetry
being
more
highly
developed
than
my
love
of
exact
science
you
need
lift
your
eyebrows
it
not
a
pretty
habit
who
going
to
make
the
deputation
asked
fauvette
you
for
one
you
our
strongest
point
you
look
naturally
affectionate
and
clinging
and
docile
and
and
easily
led
and
all
the
rest
of
it
you
burble
forth
something
pretty
about
wanting
to
have
an
expedition
with
our
principal
in
our
midst
and
mention
what
a
wet
day
it
was
last
year
and
how
disappointed
we
all
were
look
here
i
not
going
to
do
all
the
talking
so
do
think
oh
we
support
you
but
i
just
giving
you
a
few
leading
lines
to
work
upon
we
take
maudie
heywood
with
us
she
got
marks
out
of
a
hundred
last
week
which
ought
to
go
for
something
then
magsie
and
muriel
had
better
come
too
it
wo
do
to
let
the
bumble
think
the
whole
idea
has
originated
with
us
right
you
are
the
more
pattern
pupils
we
can
scrape
together
the
better
at
five
the
deputation
presented
itself
at
the
door
of
the
study
and
was
received
graciously
by
the
principal
though
she
declined
to
commit
herself
to
an
immediate
answer
promising
to
think
the
matter
over
and
to
let
them
know
later
on
which
means
she
dare
say
till
she
asked
leave
from
gibbie
declared
raymonde
when
the
delegates
were
out
of
of
the
sanctum
fauvette
child
you
did
splendidly
i
give
five
thousand
pounds
to
have
your
big
pathetic
innocent
blue
eyes
they
always
bowl
everybody
over
i
envy
you
at
your
first
dance
you
have
your
programme
full
in
five
minutes
like
the
heroine
of
a
novel
raymonde
supposition
was
not
altogether
mistaken
for
that
evening
after
the
school
had
gone
to
bed
miss
beasley
miss
gibbs
and
mademoiselle
sat
up
talking
over
the
proposed
expedition
miss
gibbs
vetoed
the
idea
entirely
the
girls
have
not
been
behaving
well
enough
to
justify
any
such
indulgence
she
maintained
impressively
their
conduct
on
the
stairs
yesterday
was
disgraceful
better
make
them
stick
to
their
lessons
mademoiselle
whose
mental
scales
always
tipped
naturally
towards
the
side
of
pleasure
thought
it
was
a
beautiful
idea
of
the
dear
girls
to
want
to
give
their
headmistress
a
f√™te
on
her
anniversary
so
sweet
to
go
upon
the
water
and
while
the
weather
was
so
pleasant
it
would
be
an
event
to
be
remembered
for
ever
in
their
young
lives
when
sterner
lessons
might
be
forgotten
at
which
remark
miss
gibbs
sniffed
but
restrained
herself
miss
beasley
vibrated
for
some
minutes
between
the
practical
and
the
ideal
aspects
thus
presented
to
her
but
finally
decided
in
favour
of
the
latter
it
seems
ungracious
to
refuse
when
they
wish
it
to
be
my
birthday
treat
she
said
rather
apologetically
the
poor
children
would
be
so
disappointed
we
might
make
a
clear
a
necessary
condition
yes
miss
gibbs
grudgingly
conceded
they
miss
their
latin
preparation
that
evening
she
added
and
their
french
sighed
mademoiselle
but
what
will
you
with
a
little
shrug
it
is
not
every
day
that
our
principal
makes
a
birthday
as
for
me
i
am
glad
i
bought
my
new
sunshade
the
announcement
of
the
forthcoming
water
excursion
was
received
with
great
rejoicings
ever
since
the
beginning
of
the
term
the
school
had
thirsted
to
go
upon
the
river
they
had
been
taken
for
an
occasional
walk
along
its
banks
and
had
greatly
envied
the
young
men
and
maidens
who
might
be
seen
punting
up
its
willowy
reaches
that
what
i
going
to
do
directly
i
grown
up
fauvette
had
confided
to
her
chums
i
buy
a
white
boating
costume
exactly
like
that
girl
with
the
auburn
hair
and
lean
against
blue
cushions
while
he
rows
he
have
to
have
brown
eyes
but
i
not
quite
decided
yet
whether
he
shall
have
a
moustache
or
not
on
the
whole
i
think
i
have
him
clean
shaven
and
tall
prompted
raymonde
to
whom
fauvette
prospective
romances
were
a
source
of
perennial
interest
yes
tall
of
course
with
several
military
crosses
he
the
one
going
to
like
the
best
though
there
be
others
they
all
want
me
to
go
and
row
with
them
but
i
sha
i
do
mean
to
flirt
n
no
conceded
raymonde
a
little
dubiously
do
you
think
though
it
might
be
rather
good
for
him
not
to
let
him
see
you
were
too
keen
of
course
i
do
want
you
to
break
his
heart
but
fauvette
shook
her
yellow
curls
it
not
right
to
trifle
with
people
hearts
she
decided
with
all
the
authority
of
an
experienced
reader
of
magazine
stories
if
you
pretend
you
do
care
for
them
they
drive
their
aeroplanes
recklessly
and
smash
up
or
expose
themselves
to
the
enemy
fire
or
get
submarined
before
you
had
time
to
tell
them
you
did
really
mean
to
be
cold
i
not
going
in
for
misunderstandings
raymonde
glanced
at
her
admiringly
with
those
blue
eyes
and
fluffy
curls
it
all
seemed
so
possible
she
felt
that
she
should
look
forward
to
her
chum
inevitable
engagement
almost
as
much
as
fauvette
herself
it
would
be
as
good
as
a
shakespeare
play
or
one
of
the
best
pieces
on
the
kinema
but
these
rosy
prospects
were
still
in
the
dim
and
distant
future
the
present
was
entirely
prosaic
and
unromantic
whatever
punting
excursions
fauvette
might
enjoy
in
years
to
come
this
particular
water
party
would
be
quite
unsentimental
conducted
under
the
watchful
eyes
of
miss
beasley
and
miss
gibbs
with
boatmen
well
over
military
age
to
do
the
rowing
for
the
first
time
for
four
years
the
principal
birthday
morning
was
gloriously
fine
the
pupils
placed
the
usual
bouquet
of
flowers
opposite
her
seat
at
the
breakfast
table
together
with
a
handsomely
bound
volume
of
ruskin
of
she
thanked
them
with
her
customary
surprise
and
gratitude
and
assured
them
as
she
did
annually
what
a
pleasure
it
was
to
her
to
receive
so
kind
a
token
of
their
esteem
this
preliminary
business
being
over
breakfast
and
classes
proceeded
as
usual
a
more
than
ordinary
atmosphere
of
decorum
pervading
the
establishment
for
miss
gibbs
had
announced
that
the
excursion
depended
upon
the
and
the
girls
knew
that
she
would
keep
her
word
the
veriest
slackers
paid
attention
to
lessons
that
morning
and
even
raymonde
for
once
did
not
receive
an
order
mark
lunch
was
served
early
and
directly
the
meal
was
finished
all
the
girls
flew
upstairs
to
change
their
attire
during
hot
weather
the
school
was
not
kept
strictly
to
the
brown
serge
uniform
and
the
girls
blossomed
out
into
linen
costumes
or
white
drill
skirts
and
muslin
blouses
for
the
credit
of
the
grange
they
made
careful
toilettes
that
afternoon
fauvette
in
particular
looked
ravishingly
pretty
in
a
sailor
suit
with
a
white
collar
and
silk
tie
she
made
quite
a
sensation
as
she
came
down
the
stairs
the
mistresses
had
also
turned
out
suitably
dressed
for
the
occasion
miss
beasley
was
dignified
and
matronly
in
blue
voile
with
a
motor
veil
miss
gibbs
who
intended
to
row
was
in
practical
blouse
and
short
skirt
while
mademoiselle
was
a
dream
of
white
muslin
chiffon
ruffles
and
pink
parasol
it
was
about
half
an
hour
walk
to
the
river
down
shady
lanes
and
across
lately
cleared
hayfields
there
was
a
little
close
to
the
weir
with
a
a
refreshment
room
and
rows
of
benches
and
tables
under
the
trees
where
visitors
could
sit
and
drink
tea
or
lemonade
miss
beasley
had
engaged
boats
beforehand
and
these
were
drawn
up
ready
with
their
boatmen
a
rheumatic
and
elderly
set
waiting
about
smoking
surreptitious
pipes
among
the
willows
there
was
a
great
deal
of
arranging
before
everybody
was
settled
and
many
injunctions
to
sit
still
and
not
to
change
places
or
to
grab
at
or
lean
too
far
over
the
side
or
play
any
other
foolish
or
dangerous
prank
likely
to
upset
the
equilibrium
of
the
boat
and
endanger
the
lives
of
its
occupants
at
last
however
the
whole
party
was
stowed
safely
away
and
the
little
procession
set
off
up
the
river
all
agreed
that
it
was
quite
delightful
the
banks
were
covered
with
trees
and
tall
reeds
and
masses
of
purple
willow
herb
and
agrimony
and
yellow
ragwort
which
were
reflected
in
the
dark
waters
of
quiet
pools
in
the
centre
the
sunshine
made
little
gleaming
glinting
ripples
like
leaping
bars
of
gold
and
here
and
there
patches
of
spread
their
white
chalices
open
to
the
sky
there
was
a
delicious
breeze
most
grateful
after
the
hot
walk
across
the
hayfields
and
the
smooth
gliding
motion
was
ideal
the
girls
trailed
their
hands
in
the
river
and
dabbed
their
faces
and
said
it
was
topping
and
began
to
sing
boat
songs
which
they
had
learnt
at
school
and
which
sounded
very
pretty
and
appropriate
to
an
accompaniment
of
oars
and
lapping
water
the
great
event
of
the
afternoon
was
to
be
a
picnic
tea
hampers
of
provisions
had
been
brought
and
miss
beasley
proposed
that
they
should
land
at
one
of
the
numerous
little
islands
light
a
fire
and
boil
their
big
kettles
the
selection
of
the
particular
island
was
of
course
in
her
discretion
and
she
had
a
conference
with
her
old
boatman
on
the
subject
island
i
knows
of
the
very
one
to
suit
you
i
taken
parties
there
before
and
there
a
good
spot
to
land
and
a
place
to
tie
the
boats
to
which
there
is
on
every
one
of
them
islands
it
just
an
hour
row
up
from
the
weir
and
less
time
to
go
back
because
of
the
current
after
gliding
onward
for
what
seemed
to
the
girls
all
too
short
a
space
of
time
but
no
doubt
appeared
considerably
longer
to
their
rheumatic
rowers
the
island
in
question
was
at
last
reached
it
looked
most
attractive
with
the
willows
and
bulrushes
and
tangly
interior
a
made
quite
a
good
and
everyone
managed
to
scramble
out
successfully
without
planting
a
foot
in
the
water
the
first
business
was
to
explore
and
to
hunt
up
sufficient
wood
for
a
camp
fire
luckily
the
weather
had
been
dry
so
that
all
available
sticks
would
be
suitable
for
fuel
the
girls
dispersed
in
various
directions
on
the
understanding
that
they
were
to
reassemble
when
miss
beasley
blew
her
whistle
as
a
signal
i
call
this
a
great
stunt
observed
morvyth
as
the
mystic
seven
moved
off
in
company
even
gibbie
in
spirits
bless
her
murmured
aveline
fatuously
so
she
is
but
all
the
same
i
rather
wander
off
alone
than
be
tied
to
her
so
come
along
quick
remember
you
to
earn
your
living
by
picking
up
sticks
so
do
slack
cheero
old
sport
do
get
raggy
pioneers
were
penetrating
the
virgin
forest
on
all
sides
from
right
and
left
came
squeals
giggles
or
chuckles
as
the
girls
investigated
the
capacities
of
the
island
some
kept
to
the
banks
and
cut
dry
reeds
to
make
the
bonfire
burn
quickly
while
others
were
in
quest
of
more
solid
fuel
if
we
only
had
a
hatchet
or
a
saw
sighed
raymonde
we
might
have
cut
off
some
quite
nice
logs
there
really
is
much
to
pick
up
on
the
ground
wish
we
could
take
that
rotten
tree
along
with
us
murmured
morvyth
pointing
to
a
decayed
old
stump
that
stood
upright
with
two
withered
boughs
like
scraggy
arms
outstretched
on
either
side
of
it
too
big
a
job
my
child
but
we
might
break
off
one
of
those
branches
opined
raymonde
no
i
know
we
ca
reach
it
from
below
that
your
humble
servant
going
to
climb
here
ave
you
bluebottle
give
me
a
leg
up
oh
suppose
it
topples
over
with
you
do
ray
bunkum
it
wo
i
not
scared
thanks
illustration
fauvette
in
particular
looked
ravishingly
pretty
as
a
matter
of
fact
raymonde
knew
perfectly
well
that
she
was
going
to
perform
rather
a
risky
feat
she
did
it
because
she
was
in
a
frame
of
mind
also
because
she
had
quarrelled
with
morvyth
earlier
in
the
afternoon
and
wished
to
astonish
her
morvyth
was
standing
now
elevating
her
eyebrows
and
looking
as
if
she
did
not
believe
that
raymonde
would
really
carry
out
her
boast
which
was
all
the
more
reason
for
the
latter
to
put
speech
into
action
aveline
obediently
rendered
the
required
assistance
and
with
a
swing
and
a
clutch
raymonde
managed
to
scramble
up
the
trunk
to
the
place
where
the
boughs
forked
one
of
these
was
in
a
particularly
crumbling
and
decrepit
condition
and
she
thought
that
with
a
strong
effort
she
might
succeed
in
breaking
it
off
it
was
not
an
easy
matter
to
balance
herself
on
the
fork
and
stretch
out
to
pull
at
the
branch
you
be
over
in
a
called
morvyth
responded
raymonde
airily
she
leaned
a
little
farther
along
seized
the
branch
with
both
hands
and
gave
a
mighty
tug
the
result
was
more
than
she
anticipated
the
poor
old
tree
had
reached
a
stage
of
such
interior
decay
that
it
was
really
only
kept
together
by
the
bark
the
violence
of
the
wrench
upset
it
to
its
foundations
it
tottered
swayed
and
suddenly
descended
the
girls
picked
up
raymonde
out
of
a
cloud
of
dust
and
a
mass
of
touchwood
by
all
strict
rules
of
retribution
she
ought
to
have
been
hurt
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
was
only
a
little
bruised
considerably
choked
with
pulverized
wood
and
very
much
astonished
when
she
recovered
her
presence
of
mind
she
set
to
work
to
break
off
pieces
from
the
boughs
which
were
just
exactly
what
was
wanted
for
the
bonfire
fuel
do
tell
gibbie
she
besought
the
others
mum
the
word
her
chums
assured
her
bless
its
little
heart
we
would
get
it
into
a
scrape
do
think
it
of
us
miss
beasley
signal
sounded
at
this
critical
moment
so
the
mystic
seven
filed
off
like
vestal
virgins
to
feed
the
fire
which
miss
gibbs
with
her
accustomed
energy
had
already
lighted
their
contribution
of
wood
was
so
substantial
that
it
drew
comment
from
the
rest
of
the
party
but
they
received
the
congratulations
with
due
modesty
and
did
not
divulge
the
source
of
their
supply
most
of
the
girls
were
too
much
interested
in
proclaiming
their
own
adventures
to
care
to
listen
to
anybody
else
and
the
mistresses
were
busy
watching
the
kettles
it
seemed
like
camp
life
over
again
to
be
sitting
in
a
circle
drinking
tea
out
of
enamelled
mugs
and
eating
thick
pieces
of
bread
and
butter
miss
beasley
had
provided
a
large
plum
birthday
cake
with
a
sixpence
baked
in
it
the
acquisition
of
which
was
naturally
a
matter
of
keen
interest
to
each
several
girl
until
the
lucky
slice
fell
to
the
lot
of
cynthia
greene
who
fondled
the
coveted
coin
tenderly
i
have
a
hole
bored
through
it
and
wear
it
on
my
chain
always
in
memory
of
you
dear
miss
beasley
she
declared
in
emphatic
tones
little
sycophant
sneered
morvyth
enviously
she
ought
to
give
it
to
the
soldiers
snapped
raymonde
but
miss
gibbs
was
rattling
a
row
of
mugs
together
as
a
delicate
hint
that
the
feast
was
finished
and
the
principal
was
consulting
her
watch
and
calling
to
the
boatmen
to
make
ready
the
monitresses
swept
all
remaining
comestibles
into
the
baskets
stamped
out
the
fire
emptied
the
kettles
and
proclaimed
the
left
in
due
order
one
by
one
the
boats
started
on
their
way
down
the
river
drifting
easily
now
with
the
current
and
leaving
long
trails
of
ripples
behind
them
the
sun
was
sinking
low
in
the
west
and
there
was
a
lovely
golden
light
on
the
water
the
shadows
on
the
willowy
shore
were
deep
and
mysterious
a
kingfisher
flashed
along
the
bank
like
a
living
jewel
the
spirits
of
the
school
already
risen
to
fermenting
point
effervesced
into
stunt
songs
composed
on
the
emergency
of
the
moment
and
passed
on
from
boat
to
boat
for
we
had
such
a
jolly
good
as
we
only
get
once
in
a
i
can
tell
you
it
was
prime
oh
we
had
a
topping
time
and
we
wish
a
little
longer
we
could
with
a
and
a
we
will
make
the
river
hum
so
come
come
come
do
be
glum
glum
glum
but
pass
the
stunt
along

marooned
amongst

the

at

the

towards

when
you
never
see
the
object
of
your

and
though
ample
statistics
were
provided
about
the
cr√®che
babies
and
literature
was
sent
describing
the
chinese
orphans
and
little
hindoo
widows
these
pieces
of
paper
information
did
not
quite
supply
the
place
of
a
real
live
prot√©g√©
it
was
felt
to
be
a
decided
asset
to
the
school
when
old
wilkinson
loomed
upon
their
horizon
the
girls
discovered
him
accidentally
engaged
in
the
meritorious
occupation
of
carrying
his
own
water
from
the
well
he
had
opened
a
gate
for
them
and
had
touched
his
forelock
with
the
grace
and
fervour
of
a
medi√¶val
retainer
his
pink
cheeks
watery
blue
eyes
hair
and
generally
picturesque
personality
made
the
more
enthusiastic
members
of
the
art
class
anxious
to
paint
his
portrait
it
was
ascertained
that
he
subsisted
upon
an
pension
of
five
shillings
a
week
and
resided
in
a
cottage
just
between
the
grange
and
the
village
to
visit
old
wilkinson
and
present
him
with
potatoes
from
their
own
little
became
an
immediate
institution
among
the
girls
there
was
no
doubt
about
his
gratitude
all
was
fish
that
came
to
his
net
and
he
accepted
anything
and
everything
from
tea
and
tobacco
to
books
which
he
could
not
read
with
the
same
toothless
smile
and
showers
of
blessings
if
as
miss
gibbs
suggested
his
cottage
would
have
been
improved
by
a
little
more
soap
and
water
and
a
good
stiff
broom
that
did
not
really
matter
as
he
was
generally
sitting
outside
on
a
bench
beside
a
beehive
with
a
manx
cat
upon
his
knee
and
a
tame
jackdaw
hanging
in
a
wicker
cage
by
the
window
exactly
like
a
coloured
frontispiece
in
a
christmas
number
of
a
magazine
it
was
a
tremendous
blow
to
the
school
when
the
news
was
circulated
that
old
wilkinson
had
received
notice
to
quit
his
cottage
the
girls
were
filled
with
indignation
against
his
landlord
the
fact
that
that
farmer
had
received
no
rent
for
the
last
six
months
and
badly
required
the
cottage
as
a
billet
for
lady
workers
on
the
land
went
for
nothing
in
the
estimation
of
the
grange
inmates
wilkinson
so
they
considered
was
a
persecuted
old
man
about
to
be
evicted
from
his
home
and
a
very
proper
object
for
sympathy
and
consideration
something
got
to
be
done
for
him
that
flat
declared
raymonde
you
do
suppose
we
can
allow
him
to
be
taken
to
the
workhouse
unthinkable
he
break
his
poor
old
heart
and
we
miss
him
so
too
wo
the
landlord
change
his
mind
and
let
him
stay
miss
gibbs
went
to
see
him
about
it
vouchsafed
aveline
agitatedly
and
she
came
back
and
shook
her
head
and
said
she
could
but
feel
that
the
man
was
only
doing
his
duty
and
women
were
wanted
on
the
land
and
must
have
a
place
to
live
in
and
someone
had
to
be
sacrificed
he
a
victim
of
the
war
sighed
morvyth
one
of
those
outside
victims
who
do
get
victoria
crosses
and
military
funerals
he
has
come
to
a
funeral
yet
bristled
raymonde
the
old
boy
looks
good
for
another
ten
years
or
so
do
you
go
ordering
tombstones
and
wreaths
i
was
going
to
how
you
snap
me
up
all
the
same
i
heard
miss
beasley
tell
miss
gibbs
that
if
he
has
to
go
to
the
workhouse
it
will
be
enough
to
kill
him
then
we
absolutely
got
to
keep
him
alive
wo
anybody
in
the
village
take
him
in
no
they
all
full
up
and
say
they
ca
do
with
him
and
he
has
any
relations
of
his
own
except
a
drunken
granddaughter
in
a
town
slum
raymonde
sighed
dramatically
i
going
to
think
and
think
and
think
and
think
until
i
find
some
way
of
helping
him
she
announced
it
be
hard
work
because
i
hate
thinking
but
i
do
it
you
see
raymonde
was
abstracted
that
evening
both
at
preparation
and
at
supper
in
the
dormitory
she
put
aside
all
conversation
with
a
firm
do
talk
to
me
i
thinking
she
borrowed
fauvette
bottle
of
and
went
to
bed
with
a
bandage
tied
round
her
head
to
assist
her
cogitations
of
course
i
sha
go
to
sleep
she
assured
the
others
i
must
just
lie
awake
until
the
idea
comes
to
me
old
wilkinson
on
my
mind
glad
he
not
on
mine
gurgled
aveline
settling
herself
comfortably
on
her
pillow
could
you
leave
him
until
certainly
not
i
shall
wake
you
up
and
tell
you
when
my
idea
arrives
help
murmured
her
schoolmate
that
night
when
the
whole
household
at
the
grange
was
soundly
wrapped
in
slumber
aveline
was
suddenly
brought
back
from
a
jumbled
dream
of
punts
cows
and
latin
exercises
by
feeling
somebody
shaking
her
persistently
and
urgently
what
the
matter
she
asked
sitting
up
in
bed
is
it
zepps
sh
sh
do
wake
the
whole
dormitory
you
goose
came
voice
in
a
whisper
remember
gibbie
door
wide
open
ca
you
i
just
got
my
idea
aveline
promptly
lay
down
again
and
closed
her
eyes
wo
it
keep
till
she
murmured
certainly
not
you
got
to
hear
it
now
move
further
on
i
coming
into
bed
with
you
that
better
but
i
so
sleepy
rather
crossly
do
be
horrid
you
might
wake
up
for
once
and
listen
i
am
listening
well
i
tell
you
then
i
said
to
myself
when
i
began
to
think
wanted
is
a
home
for
old
wilkinson
and
just
now
it
suddenly
flashed
into
my
head
make
him
one
for
ourselves
where
that
the
point
the
bumble
says
she
ca
have
him
at
the
grange
hermie
suggested
that
and
every
place
one
knows
of
seems
to
belong
to
somebody
who
wants
it
all
except
the
island
what
island
the
one
on
the
river
no
no
not
so
far
as
that
the
island
on
our
moat
i
mean
build
a
little
house
for
him
and
he
can
have
it
all
for
his
very
own
would
it
would
it
be
rather
difficult
to
build
gasped
aveline
dazed
at
the
magnitude
of
her
chum
idea
oh
not
impossible
there
are
heaps
and
heaps
of
railway
sleepers
down
in
the
wood
heap
and
we
could
pile
them
up
into
a
hut
it
only
what
people
do
out
in
canada
gibbie
always
telling
us
tales
of
women
who
emigrate
to
the
backwoods
and
build
colonies
of
ave
you
not
going
to
sleep
again
are
you
n
no
came
a
rather
languid
voice
but
how
we
ever
get
to
the
island
we
make
a
raft
we
do
it
you
and
i
do
tell
any
of
the
others
yet
morvyth
been
so
nasty
lately
i
fed
up
with
her
and
ardiune
would
only
laugh
when
we
got
the
thing
really
started
we
take
them
over
and
let
them
help
but
not
till
then
will
you
promise
to
keep
it
an
absolute
secret
i
promise
anything
you
like
wearily
if
you
only
go
back
to
your
own
bed
all
right
i
off
now
but
just
remember
you
not
to
mention
it
to
a
single
soul
raymonde
next
day
was
tremendously
full
of
her
new
scheme
it
savoured
of
romance
old
wilkinson
would
be
a
combination
of
a
medi√¶val
hermit
and
robinson
crusoe
and
in
imagination
she
already
saw
him
installed
in
a
picturesque
with
his
manx
cat
and
his
tame
jackdaw
for
company
naturally
the
first
step
was
to
take
possession
of
the
island
it
lay
in
the
middle
of
the
moat
a
reedy
little
domain
covered
with
willows
and
bushes
it
had
never
yet
been
explored
by
the
school
for
the
simple
reason
that
there
had
been
no
means
of
gaining
access
to
it
the
water
was
too
deep
for
wading
and
miss
beasley
had
utterly
vetoed
the
suggestion
of
procuring
a
punt
raymonde
had
cast
longing
eyes
at
it
many
times
before
but
not
until
now
had
she
made
any
real
effort
to
reach
it
she
thought
out
her
plans
carefully
during
the
day
considerably
to
the
detriment
of
her
lessons
and
when
afternoon
recreation
time
came
round
she
linked
aveline
arm
firmly
in
hers
and
led
her
to
the
lumber
yard
here
piled
up
behind
the
barn
was
a
large
stack
of
wood
stored
for
fuel
old
railway
sleepers
bits
of
broken
fencing
trees
and
brushwood
what
we
want
to
make
first
she
announced
is
a
raft
i
wonder
it
never
struck
me
to
make
it
before
now
rafts
sound
quite
simple
and
easy
when
you
read
about
them
in
books
of
adventure
shipwrecked
mariners
on
coral
islands
in
the
pacific
always
lash
a
few
logs
together
with
incredible
speed
and
perform
wonderful
journeys
through
boiling
surf
to
rescue
kegs
of
provisions
and
other
useful
commodities
which
they
observe
floating
about
on
the
waves
the
waters
of
the
moat
being
tranquil
and
overgrown
with
duckweed
would
surely
prove
more
hospitable
than
the
surging
ocean
and
ought
to
support
a
raft
of
however
amateur
a
description
nevertheless
when
they
began
to
look
round
it
was
more
difficult
than
they
had
expected
to
find
just
the
right
material
the
railway
sleepers
were
too
large
and
heavy
and
the
fence
poles
were
of
unequal
lengths
moreover
there
was
nothing
with
which
to
lash
them
together
for
when
raymonde
visited
the
orchard
intending
to
purloin
a
she
found
the
housemaid
there
hanging
up
a
row
of
pantry
towels
and
was
obliged
to
beat
a
hurried
retreat
after
much
hunting
about
the
girls
at
last
discovered
in
a
corner
exactly
what
they
wanted
it
was
the
door
of
a
demolished
shed
made
of
stout
planking
strongly
nailed
and
braced
and
in
fairly
sound
condition
nothing
could
have
been
better
for
their
purpose
after
first
doing
a
little
scouting
to
make
sure
that
the
rest
of
the
school
were
safely
at
the
other
side
of
the
garden
they
dragged
it
down
to
the
edge
of
the
moat
returning
to
fetch
two
small
saplings
to
act
as
for
goodness
sake
let
be
quick
and
get
off
before
anybody
comes
round
and
catches
us
panted
raymonde
are
you
absolutely
certain
it
safe
quavered
aveline
dubiously
raymonde
looked
at
her
scornfully
aveline
kerby
if
you
do
feel
yourself
up
to
this
business
please
back
out
of
it
at
once
and
i
go
and
fetch
morvyth
instead
she
may
be
a
blighter
in
some
things
but
she
does
funk
no
more
do
i
declared
aveline
suddenly
assuming
an
air
of
dignified
abandon
reminiscent
of
the
heroes
of
stories
i
ready
to
brave
anything
especially
for
the
sake
of
old
wilkinson
do
tip
the
thing
so
hard
at
your
end
you
made
me
trap
my
fingers
they
launched
their
craft
from
the
treading
ruthlessly
on
linda
irises
and
hermie
cherished
it
seemed
to
float
all
right
so
they
crawled
on
and
squatted
on
the
on
either
side
of
it
to
preserve
its
balance
a
good
push
with
their
poles
sent
them
well
out
on
to
the
moat
it
was
really
a
delightful
sensation
sailing
amongst
the
duckweed
and
leaves
although
their
shoes
and
skirts
got
wet
from
the
water
which
oozed
up
between
the
planks
the
raft
behaved
splendidly
and
propelled
by
the
poles
made
quite
a
steady
passage
they
had
soon
crossed
the
piece
of
water
and
scrambled
out
upon
the
island
it
was
a
rather
overgrown
brambly
little
domain
and
to
penetrate
its
fastnesses
proved
a
scratchy
performance
resulting
in
a
long
rent
down
the
front
of
skirt
and
several
tears
in
aveline
muslin
blouse
to
say
nothing
of
wounds
on
wrists
and
ankles
there
was
quite
a
clearing
in
the
middle
with
soft
mossy
grass
and
clumps
of
hemp
agrimony
and
actually
a
small
with
nine
apples
upon
it
they
were
green
and
very
sour
but
the
girls
each
sampled
one
with
a
kind
of
feeling
that
by
so
doing
they
were
taking
formal
possession
of
the
territory
though
with
paradise
for
an
analogy
it
should
have
been
just
the
reverse
we
have
the
exactly
here
said
raymonde
munching
abstractedly
it
face
the
sunset
and
he
can
sit
and
watch
the
glowing
west
and
hear
the
evening
bells
and
and
smoke
his
pipe
suggested
aveline
unromantically
he
generally
seems
most
grateful
of
all
when
one
gives
him
tobacco
we
shall
be
able
to
see
him
sitting
there
continued
raymonde
in
her
most
meditative
mood
there
be
a
planted
beside
the
door
and
nasturtiums
and
other
thingumbobs
for
the
bees
it
make
a
beautiful
end
to
his
declining
years
yes
agreed
aveline
suppressing
a
yawn
she
was
not
so
enthusiastic
over
the
scheme
as
her
chum
and
her
apple
had
been
much
too
sour
to
be
really
enjoyed
raymonde
sat
twining
pieces
of
grass
round
her
finger
her
eyes
were
dreamy
and
she
hummed
those
evening
bells
which
the
singing
class
had
learnt
only
the
week
before
at
that
identical
moment
the
clang
of
a
very
different
bell
disturbed
the
echoes
the
girls
sprang
to
their
feet
they
gasped
in
consternation
they
had
absolutely
no
idea
it
was
so
late
time
had
simply
flown
they
must
get
back
immediately
and
even
then
might
expect
to
lose
order
marks
regardless
of
scratches
they
scurried
through
the
brambles
to
the
place
where
they
had
left
their
raft
to
their
horror
it
was
gone
they
had
forgotten
to
anchor
it
and
it
had
floated
out
into
the
middle
of
the
moat
this
was
indeed
a
predicament
they
looked
at
each
other
aghast
we
marooned
that
what
it
is
stammered
aveline
raymonde
you
the
silliest
idiot
i
ever
met
in
the
course
of
my
life
well
i
like
that
ca
help
it
it
the
truth
whatever
did
you
bring
me
out
here
for
on
such
a
chase
why
you
wanted
to
come
i
did
you
landed
me
in
a
horrible
scrape
i
been
late
for
prep
twice
already
this
week
and
gibbie
gave
me
enough
last
time
so
what
she
say
this
time
goodness
knows
how
are
we
ever
going
to
get
back
raymonde
shook
her
head
and
whistled
she
might
have
attempted
to
defend
herself
but
aveline
by
this
time
had
begun
to
sob
hysterically
and
she
knew
that
arguments
were
useless
the
prospects
of
immediate
rescue
certainly
appeared
doubtful
everyone
would
be
indoors
for
preparation
no
doubt
they
would
be
missed
and
probably
a
monitress
might
be
sent
in
quest
of
them
but
the
house
would
be
searched
first
and
then
the
barns
and
garden
and
it
was
quite
problematical
whether
it
would
enter
into
anybody
head
to
walk
to
the
edge
of
the
moat
and
look
across
towards
the
island
i
suppose
you
ca
swim
asked
aveline
choking
back
her
sobs
and
dabbing
her
eyes
with
her
handkerchief
no
only
a
little
bit
when
somebody
holds
me
up
whoever
would
have
thought
of
that
wretched
raft
floating
off
in
that
fashion
it
too
sickening
do
you
think
we
better
give
a
good
shout
the
girls
put
their
united
lung
power
into
the
loudest
halloo
of
which
they
were
capable
but
it
only
scared
a
blackbird
in
the
orchard
and
provoked
no
human
response
they
sat
down
in
a
place
where
they
could
be
best
seen
from
the
mainland
and
waited
there
were
too
many
brambles
for
comfort
and
the
midges
were
biting
badly
raymonde
began
to
wonder
whether
after
all
the
island
were
as
ideal
a
situation
for
a
residence
as
she
had
supposed
some
lines
from
a
parody
on
one
of
rogers
poems
flashed
into
her
mind
so
damp
my
cot
beside
the
rill
the
beehive
fails
to
soothe
my
ear
and
around
my
porch
earwigs
and
snails
are
ever
crawling
it
might
be
just
the
best
place
in
the
world
for
rheumatism
she
decided
and
probably
there
be
just
heaps
of
snails
and
slugs
shall
we
shout
again
suggested
aveline
forlornly
the
chums
called
whistled
halloed
and
cooeed
until
they
were
hoarse
but
not
a
soul
took
the
slightest
notice
time
which
had
sped
so
rapidly
during
their
first
twenty
minutes
on
the
island
now
crawled
on
laggard
wings
after
what
appeared
to
them
an
absolutely
interminable
period
but
which
was
in
reality
about
an
hour
and
a
half
the
familiar
figure
of
hermie
graveson
suddenly
appeared
on
the
mainland
close
to
the
raymonde
and
aveline
started
up
and
emitted
yells
that
would
have
done
credit
to
a
pair
of
zulu
warriors
on
the
hermie
waved
frantically
shouted
something
they
could
not
hear
and
ran
back
towards
the
house
in
a
few
minutes
she
returned
with
miss
gibbs
that
worthy
lady
picked
up
her
skirts
and
advanced
gingerly
to
the
extreme
limit
of
the
stones
that
bordered
the
she
put
her
hands
to
her
mouth
to
form
a
and
bawled
a
communication
of
which
the
marooned
ones
could
only
catch
such
fragments
as
how
get
doing
on
the
presumption
that
it
was
an
enquiry
into
their
means
of
locomotion
they
pointed
sadly
to
the
floating
raft
miss
beasley
now
came
hurrying
up
surveyed
the
situation
and
also
attempted
to
converse
but
with
no
better
success
after
an
agitated
colloquy
with
miss
gibbs
she
retired
think
they
have
to
leave
us
here
for
the
night
fluttered
aveline
anxiously
do
know
it
looks
like
it
unless
anyone
can
swim
returned
raymonde
with
what
stoicism
she
could
muster
perhaps
they
hire
a
cart
to
the
river
and
fetch
up
a
punt
it
take
hours
to
do
that
the
prospect
of
supper
and
bed
seemed
to
be
retreating
further
and
further
into
the
dim
and
faraway
distance
aveline
remembered
that
it
was
the
evening
for
stewed
pears
and
custard
and
tears
dripped
down
her
cheeks
on
to
her
torn
blouse
oh
brace
up
ca
you
snapped
raymonde
it
gives
me
spasms
to
hear
you
sniff
aveline
was
bursting
into
an
indignant
retort
when
her
companion
nudged
her
and
pointed
to
the
mainland
mackenzie
the
old
gardener
was
coming
across
the
orchard
carrying
on
his
shoulder
a
very
large
the
cook
followed
him
bearing
a
they
the
best
brains
in
the
house
he
going
to
rescue
us
exclaimed
raymonde
ecstatically
the
prisoners
on
the
island
watched
with
deep
interest
while
mackenzie
launched
his
shallop
clambered
in
and
seizing
the
from
cook
pushed
off
cautiously
his
craft
was
very
low
in
the
water
and
looked
particularly
wobbly
and
they
were
terribly
afraid
it
would
upset
in
spite
of
their
anxiety
they
could
not
help
seeing
the
humorous
side
of
the
episode
and
they
choked
with
laughter
as
the
tub
gyrated
and
bobbed
about
and
the
old
man
clutched
frantically
at
his
pole
he
made
first
of
all
for
the
floating
raft
secured
it
with
a
piece
of
rope
and
dragged
it
to
the
island
the
girls
straightened
their
faces
and
welcomed
him
with
polite
expressions
of
gratitude
he
received
their
thanks
ungraciously
perhaps
he
had
seen
them
laughing
pushed
the
raft
to
a
spot
where
they
could
board
it
and
remarked
tartly
ye
deserve
to
stop
where
ye
are
the
night
in
my
opeenion
get
on
with
ye
now
and
paddle
yerselves
back
giving
a
body
all
this
trouble
and
me
with
my
leg
bad
too
it
was
possibly
a
satisfaction
to
mackenzie
that
miss
beasley
shared
his
views
as
to
the
culpability
of
the
delinquents
and
the
necessity
of
giving
them
their
deserts
they
were
summoned
to
the
study
after
prayers
what
did
she
say
whispered
ardiune
morvyth
and
katherine
as
they
escorted
the
crestfallen
pair
upstairs
to
the
dormitory
all
recreation
stopped
for
three
days
and
learn
the
whole
of
elegy
choked
the
sinners
gray
elegy
you
never
do
it
oh
you
poor
chickens
the
bumble
can
be
a
perfect
beast
sometimes
i
say
what
was
it
like
on
the
island
responded
raymonde
as
she
mopped
her
eyes
the
very
next
day
came
the
news
that
the
farmer
had
decided
to
run
up
a
number
of
hutments
in
one
of
his
own
fields
to
accommodate
his
lady
workers
and
that
the
squire
had
promised
to
pay
the
rent
of
old
wilkinson
cottage
so
long
as
he
was
left
there
undisturbed
everybody
felt
it
was
a
happy
solution
of
the
difficulty
after
all
the
island
might
have
been
rather
an
awkward
place
for
him
admitted
raymonde
i
do
know
how
he
have
got
backwards
and
forwards
without
a
drawbridge
unless
he
used
a
giggled
aveline
i
sha
forget
mackenzie
in
a
hurry
it
was
the
funniest
thing
i
ever
seen
in
my
life
talk
of
people
looking
sour
he
might
have
been
eating
sloes
cook
taken
it
personally
i
afraid
i
asked
her
for
some
whitening
this
morning
to
clean
my
regimental
button
and
she
scowled
and
would
let
me
have
any
nasty
stingy
old
thing
it
a
weary
world
sighed
raymonde
especially
when
you
got
to
learn
the
whole
of
gray

the
fossil
hunters
if
miss
beasley
had
been
asked
what
was
her
most
difficult
problem
in
the
management
of
her
school
she
would
probably
have
replied
the
arrangement
of
the
practising
with
the
exception
of
four
all
the
girls
learned
music
and
therefore
for
a
period
of
minutes
daily
each
of
these
pupils
must
do
execution
on
the
piano
there
were
five
instruments
at
the
grange
and
except
during
the
hours
of
morning
lessons
and
meals
they
hardly
ever
seemed
to
be
silent
at
seven
they
began
with
scales
arpeggios
and
studies
and
passed
during
the
day
through
a
selection
of
pieces
classical
and
modern
in
such
various
degrees
of
playing
strumming
and
thumping
as
might
be
calculated
to
wear
out
their
hammers
and
snap
their
strings
in
double
quick
time
about
half
of
the
girls
learned
from
mademoiselle
and
the
remainder
had
lessons
from
browne
a
visiting
master
who
came
twice
a
week
to
the
school
he
was
a
short
little
man
with
sandy
hair
and
a
bald
patch
in
the
middle
of
it
and
a
vandyke
beard
that
was
turning
rather
grey
he
was
himself
an
excellent
musician
and
sometimes
the
performances
of
his
pupils
offended
his
sensitive
ear
to
the
point
of
exasperation
and
he
would
storm
at
them
in
a
gurgling
voice
blinking
his
hazel
eyes
very
rapidly
and
wrinkling
up
his
forehead
till
it
looked
like
squeezed
it
was
on
record
that
he
had
once
hit
lois
barlow
a
hard
crack
over
the
knuckles
with
his
whereupon
she
wept
not
so
much
from
pain
as
from
injured
feelings
and
he
had
apologized
in
quite
a
gentlemanly
fashion
and
picked
up
the
music
that
in
his
burst
of
temper
he
had
flung
upon
the
floor
in
spite
of
his
acknowledged
irritability
all
the
girls
who
learned
from
him
gave
themselves
airs
of
slight
superiority
over
those
who
only
learned
from
mademoiselle
though
strict
he
was
an
inspiring
teacher
and
when
as
occasionally
happened
he
would
push
his
pupil
from
the
stool
and
seat
himself
in
her
place
to
show
the
proper
rendering
of
some
passage
the
music
that
followed
was
like
a
lovely
liquid
dream
of
sound
professor
marshall
also
attended
the
school
twice
a
week
to
lecture
on
literature
and
natural
science
he
was
a
much
greater
general
favourite
than
browne
everybody
appreciated
his
affable
manner
and
bland
smile
and
the
little
jokes
with
which
he
punctuated
his
remarks
the
girls
always
felt
that
it
made
a
change
to
have
anybody
coming
in
from
the
outside
world
the
one
disadvantage
of
a
is
that
mistresses
and
pupils
shut
up
together
and
seeing
one
another
week
in
week
out
are
rather
apt
to
get
on
each
others
nerves
at
a
day
school
the
girls
take
their
worries
home
at
four
and
the
mental
atmosphere
has
time
to
clear
before
nine
next
morning
but
when
there
is
no
until
the
end
of
the
term
little
trifles
are
sometimes
unduly
magnified
and
a
narrow
element
the
bane
of
all
communities
begins
to
creep
in
to
do
miss
beasley
justice
she
made
a
great
effort
to
combat
this
very
evil
and
to
run
her
school
on
broad
lines
she
recognized
the
necessity
of
letting
the
girls
mix
sometimes
with
outsiders
in
a
country
place
it
was
impossible
to
take
them
to
concerts
or
entertainments
but
they
occasionally
joined
the
rambles
of
the
county
antiquarian
society
or
the
local
natural
history
club
it
occurred
to
miss
beasley
that
it
would
be
an
excellent
plan
to
throw
open
some
of
professor
marshall
lectures
to
residents
in
the
neighbourhood
asking
those
people
who
attended
to
stay
to
tea
afterwards
thus
giving
her
girls
an
opportunity
of
acting
as
hostesses
and
entertaining
them
with
conversation
a
short
course
of
four
lectures
on
geology
was
announced
and
quite
a
number
of
local
ladies
responded
to
the
invitation
the
girls
received
the
news
with
mixed
feelings
rather
a
jink
ventured
ardiune
it
be
queer
to
see
rows
of
strangers
sitting
in
the
lecture
room
did
you
say
we
to
give
them
tea
when
the
professor
done
talking
yes
and
talk
to
them
ourselves
too
worse
luck
i
sure
i
know
what
to
say
fluttered
aveline
oh
the
monitresses
will
do
that
part
of
the
business
decided
raymonde
easily
we
stand
in
the
background
and
just
look
ladylike
and
and
all
the
rest
of
it
will
you
my
child
not
if
the
bumble
knows
it
she
nuts
on
this
dodge
i
do
care
i
sha
put
a
penny
in
the
slang
box
hermie
is
here
to
listen
and
make
me
gibbie
told
me
that
we
all
to
act
hostesses
in
turn
we
to
be
divided
into
four
sets
and
each
take
a
time
help
how
are
you
going
to
divide
by
four
it
works
out
at
six
and
a
half
who
to
be
the
half
girl
oh
they
make
it
seven
on
one
afternoon
and
six
the
next
i
expect
that
not
fair
it
throwing
too
much
work
on
those
six
and
not
enough
on
the
seven
it
opposed
to
all
the
instincts
of
and
justice
which
gibbie
has
laboured
so
hard
to
instil
into
me
do
see
how
the
bumble
can
manage
otherwise
unless
she
chops
a
girl
in
half
no
i
predict
you
be
chosen
among
a
select
six
and
have
to
pour
out
tea
and
hand
cakes
with
extra
power
laid
on
and
your
conversation
carefully
modulated
to
your
hearers
oh
jemima
please
to
remember
that
this
is
a
finishing
school
mocked
ardiune
do
on
any
account
shock
the
neighbourhood
by
an
unseemly
exhibition
of
vulgar
slang
it
slip
out
i
know
when
i
not
thinking
groaned
raymonde
on
the
first
afternoon
of
the
geological
course
an
audience
of
about
twenty
visitors
augmented
the
usual
gathering
in
the
lecture
hall
they
were
accommodated
with
the
best
seats
and
the
school
occupied
the
third
and
fourth
rows
directly
in
front
of
raymonde
sat
an
elderly
lady
in
a
large
black
hat
trimmed
with
cherries
which
bobbed
temptingly
over
the
brim
she
appeared
to
take
an
interest
in
her
surroundings
glanced
about
the
room
and
turned
a
reproving
eye
on
raymonde
who
ventured
to
whisper
to
aveline
with
miss
gibbs
hovering
in
the
background
with
a
expression
the
girls
hardly
dared
even
to
blink
but
aveline
managed
to
write
what
a
tartar
in
front
on
a
slip
of
paper
and
hand
it
to
her
chum
the
professor
bland
as
ever
was
coming
into
the
room
and
hanging
a
geological
map
over
the
blackboard
he
smiled
broadly
showing
his
large
white
teeth
to
the
uttermost
and
after
a
few
preliminary
remarks
of
welcome
to
the
visitors
plunged
into
a
description
of
the
earth
crust
all
went
well
for
a
while
then
an
untoward
incident
happened
the
lady
with
the
cherries
in
her
hat
who
had
possibly
taken
cold
or
was
affected
by
the
pollen
in
the
flowers
upon
the
table
sneezed
violently
not
only
once
but
twice
and
even
a
third
time
three
for
a
wedding
is
it
gibbie
whispered
raymonde
the
incorrigible
aveline
mental
equilibrium
was
always
easily
upset
the
idea
of
miss
gibbs
in
connection
with
matrimony
was
too
much
for
her
and
she
exploded
into
a
series
of
painfully
suppressed
giggles
the
more
she
tried
to
stop
the
more
hysterical
she
grew
especially
as
her
lack
of
appeared
to
produce
great
agitation
among
the
cherries
on
the
black
hat
in
front
it
was
only
by
holding
her
breath
till
she
almost
choked
that
she
managed
to
avoid
disgracing
herself
absolutely
as
morvyth
had
predicted
raymonde
was
among
the
hostesses
for
the
afternoon
she
rose
admirably
to
the
occasion
handed
round
cakes
and
bread
and
butter
and
talked
sweetly
to
the
guests
on
a
variety
of
topics
aveline
also
one
of
the
chosen
though
less
agile
in
conversation
tried
to
look
hospitable
and
welcoming
and
cultured
and
and
gracious
and
everything
else
which
might
be
expected
from
a
young
lady
at
a
miss
gibbs
who
was
keeping
the
deportment
of
the
hostesses
well
under
inspection
beamed
approval
but
spurred
them
on
to
fresh
efforts
see
that
nobody
is
neglected
she
whispered
hand
the
cakes
to
that
lady
who
is
standing
by
the
piano
and
you
raymonde
take
her
the
cream
the
chums
had
instinctively
avoided
the
owner
of
the
black
hat
with
the
cherries
but
thus
urged
they
were
bound
to
fulfil
their
social
obligations
they
offered
a
selection
of
and
fancy
biscuits
and
the
best
silver
and
murmured
some
polite
nothings
on
the
hackneyed
subject
of
the
weather
the
lady
helped
herself
and
regarded
them
with
an
offended
eye
i
believe
you
the
two
girls
who
sat
behind
me
during
the
lecture
she
remarked
tartly
i
should
like
to
say
that
i
considered
your
behaviour
disgraceful
it
would
serve
you
right
if
i
were
to
tell
your
governess
overwhelmed
with
confusion
raymonde
and
aveline
beat
a
hasty
retreat
oh
dear
does
she
think
i
was
laughing
at
her
whispered
aveline
what
must
i
do
ought
i
to
go
and
explain
and
apologize
i
simply
dare
she
a
nasty
old
thing
returned
raymonde
in
an
indignant
undertone
i
hope
she
wo
sneak
to
gibbie
you
ca
explain
i
should
go
near
her
gibbie
working
round
towards
the
piano
no
horner
stopped
her
fortunately
for
the
girls
at
this
moment
professor
marshall
cleared
his
throat
violently
and
obtaining
by
this
signal
a
temporary
respite
in
the
babel
of
small
talk
announced
that
on
the
following
saturday
afternoon
he
proposed
to
lead
a
party
to
littlewood
quarry
to
examine
the
geological
formation
there
and
search
for
fossils
he
hoped
that
all
the
present
company
would
be
able
to
attend
as
the
expedition
would
be
of
great
educational
value
the
general
conversation
in
the
room
immediately
turned
upon
geology
the
black
hat
with
cherries
bore
down
upon
the
professor
and
its
owner
plunged
into
a
lengthy
discussion
on
the
flora
of
the
carboniferous
period
so
apparently
absorbing
that
it
left
her
no
opportunity
to
lodge
complaints
as
to
the
behaviour
of
the
pupils
the
chums
whose
social
duties
were
now
finished
slipped
thankfully
away
to
prep
i
disgusted
with
the
professor
groaned
morvyth
it
too
bad
of
him
to
take
up
another
of
our
precious
saturday
afternoons
with
his
geology
excursion
the
tennis
match
will
be
all
off
now
and
i
know
we
could
have
beaten
the
sixth
i
do
want
to
hunt
for
fossils
tired
of
continually
having
my
mind
improved
we
really
do
get
a
fair
chance
for
games
at
this
school
ardiune
grumbled
in
sympathy
i
wish
gibbie
were
sporting
instead
of
intellectual
it
was
really
a
grievance
to
the
girls
to
be
obliged
to
abandon
tennis
on
this
occasion
the
match
between
sixth
and
fifth
had
been
a
fixture
and
each
side
had
hopes
of
its
own
champions
daphne
and
barbara
were
good
players
but
valentine
and
muriel
had
been
practising
early
and
late
and
in
the
estimation
of
their
own
form
were
well
in
the
running
for
victory
even
the
juniors
had
looked
forward
to
witnessing
the
combat
valentine
in
her
disappointment
went
so
far
as
to
suggest
to
miss
gibbs
that
the
match
might
claim
precedence
over
the
excursion
the
astonished
mistress
gazed
at
her
for
a
moment
with
blank
face
then
burst
out
give
up
the
fossil
hunt
in
favour
of
tennis
what
nonsense
you
ought
all
to
be
deeply
grateful
to
professor
marshall
for
coming
to
take
us
you
girls
do
appreciate
your
privileges
there
one
compensation
urged
fauvette
we
shall
walk
through
the
village
and
if
we
break
line
a
little
it
will
give
a
chance
for
somebody
to
dash
into
the
shop
and
buy
one
had
better
do
it
for
us
all
and
get
a
pound
we
pay
up
our
shares
honest
on
the
afternoon
of
saturday
rather
apathetic
geologists
started
forth
from
the
grange
each
carried
a
basket
and
a
few
who
had
scrambled
first
had
secured
hammers
miss
gibbs
armed
with
an
illustrated
catalogue
of
the
fossils
in
the
bradbury
museum
by
means
of
which
she
hoped
to
identify
specimens
brought
up
the
rear
in
company
with
veronica
and
the
school
crocodiled
in
orthodox
fashion
as
far
as
the
village
here
they
were
met
by
the
vicar
wife
and
daughter
and
several
other
ladies
who
were
to
join
the
excursion
the
double
line
swayed
and
broke
miss
gibbs
attention
became
engaged
by
visitors
and
during
the
few
minutes
halt
raymonde
well
covered
by
her
comrades
seized
the
golden
opportunity
darted
into
the
shop
and
emerged
with
a
large
packet
hidden
in
her
basket
before
mistress
or
monitresses
had
had
time
to
miss
her
paradise
drops
she
announced
with
gleeful
caution
got
them
because
they
were
on
the
counter
and
the
quickest
thing
i
could
buy
no
i
dare
dole
them
out
now
you
must
wait
till
we
get
to
the
quarry
gibbie
notice
you
sucking
them
you
idiots
it
was
rather
a
long
way
to
littlewood
much
too
far
in
the
opinion
though
they
would
have
thought
nothing
of
the
walk
had
they
been
keener
on
its
object
should
have
minded
so
much
if
we
come
on
a
thursday
and
missed
french
translation
why
had
it
to
be
saturday
groused
ardiune
because
saturday
the
only
day
the
men
are
working
in
the
quarry
for
goodness
sake
stop
grumbling
returned
hermie
in
her
most
monitressy
manner
if
you
ca
enjoy
things
yourself
let
other
people
have
a
chance
at
any
rate
duly
snubbed
ardiune
subsided
and
tramped
on
in
silence
her
discontent
slightly
alleviated
by
the
prospect
of
paradise
drops
for
raymonde
was
rattling
the
basket
suggestively
to
cheer
her
up
extra
visitors
joined
the
party
here
and
there
upon
the
way
and
outside
littlewood
village
the
professor
himself
was
waiting
for
them
beaming
as
usual
and
carrying
a
most
hammer
and
a
little
bass
for
specimens
he
greeted
them
with
one
of
his
customary
jokes
and
they
smiled
obediently
more
out
of
habit
than
inclination
the
quarry
proved
more
exciting
than
they
had
anticipated
it
was
a
large
place
and
to
get
down
into
it
they
were
obliged
to
descend
several
steep
ladders
leading
from
one
platform
to
another
arrived
at
the
bottom
level
professor
marshall
collected
his
students
in
a
group
round
him
and
delivered
a
lecturette
upon
the
points
to
be
noticed
in
the
strata
surrounding
them
raymonde
listened
sadly
it
seemed
to
her
an
unprofitable
way
of
spending
a
saturday
afternoon
she
brightened
however
when
the
audience
dispersed
to
commence
practical
work
come
along
she
whispered
to
her
chums
let
scoot
over
there
and
begin
to
chop
rocks
quick
where
are
the
paradise
drops
enquired
the
others
eagerly
do
worry
i
have
them
safe
only
wait
till
gibbie
back
is
turned
though
they
were
decidedly
tired
of
lectures
the
girls
nevertheless
were
quite
mildly
interested
in
searching
for
fossils
there
was
an
element
of
competition
about
it
which
appealed
to
them
and
when
hermie
found
a
fine
specimen
of
the
fifth
felt
that
they
must
not
be
outdone
we
have
got
anything
really
decent
yet
sighed
aveline
watching
with
envious
eyes
as
hermie
exhibited
her
treasure
to
the
admiring
visitors
the
sixth
are
cackling
ever
so
hard
let
go
over
there
suggested
raymonde
no
one
explored
that
bit
of
the
quarry
we
might
find
all
sorts
of
things
the
mystic
seven
who
generally
clung
together
in
their
undertakings
scaled
a
ladder
therefore
climbed
a
mound
of
refuse
and
found
themselves
on
new
ground
they
dispersed
and
each
searched
to
the
best
of
her
ability
among
the
pieces
of
crumbly
rock
that
were
lying
about
aveline
absorbed
in
splitting
strata
with
her
hammer
was
suddenly
disturbed
by
a
piercing
yell
and
a
shout
of
help
she
ran
at
once
in
the
direction
of
the
screams
and
round
the
corner
discovered
raymonde
sunk
nearly
to
her
waist
in
a
kind
of
clay
bog
help
me
she
implored
i
ca
get
out
the
more
i
try
the
deeper
i
seem
to
sink
in
do
struggle
then
wait
a
minute
said
aveline
advancing
on
to
some
stones
and
stretching
out
a
hand
can
you
manage
now
raymonde
made
a
desperate
but
futile
effort
no
i
stuck
tight
ca
move
my
legs
do
pull
me
or
i
be
in
too
now
i
going
to
tug
one
of
your
legs
out
that
it
now
the
other
here
you
are
good
gracious
what
a
mess
you
in
arrived
on
firm
ground
raymonde
certainly
looked
a
deplorable
object
her
feet
were
two
shapeless
lumps
of
wet
clay
she
regarded
them
with
rueful
consternation
ardiune
came
running
up
and
being
of
a
practical
turn
of
mind
set
to
work
to
scrape
her
friend
clean
with
a
thin
piece
of
stone
she
succeeded
in
removing
the
bulk
of
the
matter
adhering
to
her
but
there
still
remained
a
most
unsightly
coating
of
mud
what
were
you
doing
to
get
yourself
in
such
a
fix
she
asked
i
do
know
it
looked
quite
solid
and
then
when
i
stepped
on
it
i
just
sank
in
squash
i
might
have
been
swallowed
up
in
it
and
killed
if
ave
had
tugged
me
out
you
look
a
nice
object
to
walk
home
with
giggled
aveline
gibbie
say
what
miss
gibbs
remarked
when
she
saw
the
state
of
her
garments
was
really
raymonde
i
might
have
known
you
would
be
sure
to
do
some
stupid
thing
no
other
girl
in
the
school
has
fallen
into
the
mud
why
did
you
keep
with
the
rest
and
look
where
you
were
going
more
trouble
than
everybody
else
put
together
if
you
ca
behave
yourself
when
you
come
on
an
excursion
you
must
be
left
behind
to
do
some
preparation
the
mystics
consoled
their
leader
as
best
they
could
offering
her
their
last
remaining
paradise
drops
and
walking
in
a
clump
round
her
through
the
village
to
shield
her
from
observation
ardiune
who
was
poetically
inclined
thought
the
occasion
worthy
of
being
celebrated
in
verse
and
at
bedtime
handed
raymonde
the
following
effusion
illustrated
with
spirited
sketches
in
black
representing
her
with
feet
of
gigantic
proportions
raymonde
a
nice
and
cheerful
child
who
seldom
wept
and
often
smiled
was
taken
by
her
teachers
kind
a
jaunt
to
elevate
her
mind
by
lengthy
ladders
undismayed
behold
her
seek
the
quarry
shade
with
firm
resolve
to
hit
and
hew
and
find
a
fossil
fern
or
two
she
rapped
the
rocks
with
anxious
pick
and
scooped
the
ammonites
out
quick
but
as
she
rang
her
brief
there
chanced
to
her
a
sad
mishap
urged
on
by
hope
of
fossil
round
she
stepped
on
some
perfidious
ground
so
now
behold
our
luckless
ray
plunged
in
the
midst
of
horrid
clay
the
mud
had
nearly
reached
her
waist
she
called
aloud
in
frantic
haste
i
sink
i
sink
in
quagmire
sable
to
free
myself
i
am
unable
her
friend
who
hurried
to
her
shout
had
much
ado
to
drag
her
out
see
thick
with
mud
and
faint
with
fright
she
bravely
bears
her
woeful
plight
her
tender
teacher
anxious
fears
she
soothes
and
dries
her
friends
fond
tears
declaring
with
a
courage
calm
the
outing
had
been
worth
th
alarm
humph
good
for
you
ardiune
commented
raymonde
not
much
tenderness
about
gibbie
though
and
i
did
see
anybody
fond
tears
you
all
laughed
at
me
my
feet
were
a
yard
long
anyway
poetic
and
artistic
license
allows
a
few
slight
exaggerations
even
shakespeare
took
liberties
with
his
subjects
returned
the
authoress
blandly
if
not
exactly
a
yard
long
your
feet
not
small
by
nature
looked
absolutely
enormous
it
the
truth
chapter
xviii
mademoiselle
fran√ßais
mademoiselle
she
opened
the
window
and
out
she
fell
and
what
happened
next
i
never
heard
tell
fran√ßais
mademoiselle
chanted
raymonde
dancing
into
the
dormitory
and
plumping
down
on
fauvette
bed
amid
a
pile
of
chiffons
muslins
and
other
flimsy
articles
of
wearing
apparel
why
what
the
matter
child
whence
this
you
look
weepy
packing
to
go
home
mother
ill
or
are
you
expelled
neither
gulped
fauvette
with
a
watery
smile
it
only
her
mademoiselle
she
turned
all
my
drawers
out
on
to
the
floor
and
says
i
got
to
tidy
them
she
lectured
me
hard
in
french
i
could
understand
half
of
what
she
said
but
i
knew
she
was
scolding
and
i
to
sort
all
these
things
out
and
put
them
neatly
away
and
mend
up
everything
that
needs
mending
before
this
evening
or
else
she
tell
the
bumble
to
come
and
look
at
them
and
i
shall
get
lacking
in
order
down
in
my
report
again
it
too
bad
it
positively
brutal
of
mademoiselle
said
raymonde
reflectively
if
it
had
been
gibbie
now
it
would
have
been
no
surprise
to
me
do
cry
you
little
silly
you
look
like
a
weeping
cherub
on
a
monument
shovel
your
clothes
back
again
into
your
drawers
and
put
a
tidy
top
layer
that
what
i
always
do
so
do
i
wailed
fauvette
but
it
wo
work
this
time
mademoiselle
was
really
cross
and
i
could
see
she
means
to
come
and
hold
what
she
calls
inspection
she
said
something
about
making
me
an
example
why
if
she
wants
an
example
need
she
choose
me
it
certainly
breaking
a
butterfly
agreed
raymonde
i
afraid
there
something
seriously
wrong
with
mademoiselle
she
completely
altered
this
last
week
she
never
used
to
worry
about
things
and
she
suddenly
turned
as
fussy
as
gibbie
raymonde
was
not
the
only
one
who
had
noticed
the
change
in
the
french
mistress
it
was
apparent
to
everybody
her
entire
character
seemed
suddenly
to
have
altered
whereas
beforetime
she
had
been
easygoing
slack
and
ready
to
shut
eyes
and
ears
to
failings
she
was
now
keenly
vigilant
and
highly
exacting
in
classes
and
at
music
lessons
she
demanded
the
utmost
attention
and
no
longer
passed
over
mistakes
or
allowed
a
bad
accent
she
prohibited
the
use
of
the
english
tongue
altogether
during
meals
and
insisted
upon
her
pupils
conversing
in
french
requiring
each
one
to
come
to
table
primed
with
a
suitable
remark
in
that
language
the
number
of
fines
which
she
inflicted
was
so
heavy
that
the
missionary
box
filled
with
a
rapidity
more
gratifying
to
the
local
secretary
of
the
society
than
to
the
contributors
the
girls
were
considerably
puzzled
at
this
change
of
face
on
the
part
of
mademoiselle
but
morvyth
and
katherine
gave
it
as
their
opinion
that
miss
beasley
lay
at
the
back
of
it
the
bumble
probably
had
a
talk
with
her
and
told
her
she
must
buck
up
or
go
suggested
the
former
i
sure
she
always
thought
mademoiselle
a
slacker
which
she
certainly
was
possibly
she
given
her
till
the
end
of
the
term
to
show
what
she
capable
of
and
if
she
does
come
up
to
the
mark
we
shall
start
next
term
with
a
new
french
governess
i
should
care
said
raymonde
easily
i
never
liked
her
much
we
used
to
call
her
butterfly
but
she
mosquito
now
developing
a
very
unpleasant
sting
whatever
might
be
the
truth
of
morvyth
surmises
as
to
the
reason
of
mademoiselle
new
attitude
the
fact
loomed
large
having
determined
to
demonstrate
her
powers
of
discipline
she
overdid
it
she
was
one
of
those
persons
who
can
not
keep
order
and
enforce
rules
without
losing
their
tempers
and
she
stormed
at
the
girls
continually
she
developed
a
mania
for
what
she
called
surveillance
she
was
continually
paying
surprise
visits
to
dormitory
or
schoolroom
and
pouncing
upon
offenders
who
were
talking
or
otherwise
neglecting
their
duties
it
was
even
suspected
that
she
listened
behind
doors
fauvette
whose
babyish
characteristics
led
her
into
many
pitfalls
seemed
suddenly
to
become
the
scapegoat
of
mademoiselle
freshly
acquired
vigilance
fauvette
lacked
spirit
and
went
down
like
a
ninepin
before
the
least
word
of
reproof
her
feelings
were
easily
hurt
and
her
tears
always
close
to
the
surface
she
sat
now
and
sobbed
pathetically
upon
her
pillow
without
making
the
least
effort
to
tidy
up
her
belongings
raymonde
shook
her
head
over
her
you
the
sort
of
girl
who
ought
to
go
through
life
with
a
nurse
or
a
maid
to
look
after
you
you
not
fit
to
take
care
of
yourself
she
decided
look
here
how
much
wants
doing
to
your
clothes
before
the
mosquito
comes
buzzing
round
to
inspect
shoals
sighed
fauvette
wearily
i
afraid
i
left
my
mending
there
are
stockings
and
gloves
and
all
kinds
of
things
can
you
get
it
done
in
time
impossible
and
the
tears
dripped
again
on
to
a
dainty
muslin
collar
then
there
nothing
for
it
but
to
get
up
a
mending
bee
and
help
you
we
seven
are
sworn
to
stick
together
there
be
squalls
if
you
caught
in
the
dormitory
during
recreation
i
was
told
to
stay
here
cautioned
fauvette
we
got
to
risk
something
returned
raymonde
cheerily
scurrying
off
in
search
of
the
remaining
five
of
the
mystics
you
all
got
to
fetch
and
come
this
instant
she
commanded
it
an
urgency
call
like
last
term
when
we
made
t
bandages
for
roumania
and
for
the
horses
only
it
even
more
important
and
urgent
armed
with
their
sewing
materials
the
girls
slipped
one
by
one
upstairs
and
settling
themselves
upon
the
beds
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
fauvette
set
to
work
it
was
a
formidable
task
their
comrade
had
brought
a
large
assortment
of
garments
to
school
with
her
and
had
happily
left
them
unmended
trusting
to
take
them
home
to
be
repaired
at
present
they
were
mixed
in
a
hopeless
jumble
on
the
floor
and
on
her
bed
just
where
mademoiselle
had
tipped
out
the
drawers
stockings
underclothes
gloves
handkerchiefs
photos
old
letters
ribbons
ties
beads
lockets
books
and
an
assortment
of
odd
treasures
were
lying
together
in
utter
confusion
fauvette
brightened
at
the
sight
of
her
friends
mopped
her
eyes
and
pushed
back
her
fluffy
hair
from
her
hot
forehead
brace
up
raymonde
encouraged
her
we
not
going
to
help
unless
you
do
your
own
share
sort
those
things
out
and
be
putting
them
in
your
drawers
while
we
do
your
mending
morvyth
take
these
stockings
katherine
you
artistic
so
i
give
you
baby
ribbon
to
thread
through
these
bodices
ardiune
you
may
mend
gloves
ave
collect
those
hair
ribbons
and
put
them
neatly
inside
that
box
and
stack
those
photos
together
why
they
not
in
an
album
i
imagine
because
i
generally
sleep
with
one
or
two
of
them
under
my
pillow
confessed
fauvette
why
should
i
if
i
like
there
no
harm
in
it
oh
please
be
careful
with
those
beads
you
break
the
strings
i
ca
think
why
you
need
so
many
empty
chocolate
boxes
commented
aveline
sweeping
up
treasures
with
a
ruthless
hand
your
drawers
will
be
so
full
they
wo
shut
throw
half
of
them
away
no
no
i
always
keep
them
to
remind
me
of
the
people
who
gave
them
to
me
you
must
throw
any
of
them
away
they
of
memories
rather
have
them
of
chocs
myself
remarked
morvyth
dryly
fauvette
you
interesting
and
pretty
when
you
do
cry
for
goodness
sake
look
at
your
red
eyes
in
the
glass
but
as
sentimental
as
an
early
victorian
heroine
you
ought
to
wear
a
bonnet
and
a
crinoline
and
carry
a
little
fringed
parasol
and
talk
about
your
if
you
do
get
safely
engaged
to
an
officer
before
you
out
of
your
teens
you
turn
into
one
of
those
faded
females
who
bore
one
with
sickly
reminiscences
of
their
past
and
spend
the
remainder
of
your
life
pampering
a
pet
poodle
here
mended
two
pairs
of
stockings
for
you
and
i
done
three
pairs
said
raymonde
folding
up
the
articles
in
question
and
putting
them
in
her
friend
second
long
drawer
getting
on
kathy
have
you
finished
the
bodices
we
soon
have
you
straightened
up
baby
and
if
mademoiselle
oh
raymonde
sudden
ejaculation
was
caused
by
a
vision
of
no
less
a
person
than
miss
gibbs
who
was
standing
in
the
doorway
of
the
dormitory
regarding
the
sewing
party
in
some
astonishment
what
are
you
girls
doing
here
she
demanded
making
a
for
them
among
the
beds
nobody
answered
and
for
a
moment
or
two
blank
dismay
spread
itself
over
the
countenances
of
the
mystics
then
raymonde
lucky
star
came
to
the
rescue
and
popped
an
inspiration
into
her
head
you
were
telling
us
in
social
history
class
yesterday
miss
gibbs
about
the
necessity
of
women
in
their
work
if
they
are
ever
to
command
a
higher
scale
of
pay
she
explained
glibly
so
we
thought
we
better
begin
to
put
our
principles
into
practice
fauvette
had
fallen
into
arrears
and
was
in
danger
of
er
trouble
so
we
all
came
just
to
boost
her
up
to
standard
and
let
her
get
a
fair
start
again
it
on
the
basis
of
a
women
union
or
or
freemasons
we
thought
we
were
bound
to
help
one
another
miss
gibbs
was
not
a
remarkably
humorous
person
but
on
this
occasion
the
corners
of
her
mouth
were
distinctly
observed
to
twitch
she
mastered
the
weakness
instantly
however
and
remarked
i
glad
to
hear
that
you
are
interested
in
this
is
certainly
a
practical
demonstration
of
the
theory
and
fauvette
ought
to
be
grateful
to
you
be
quick
and
finish
straightening
the
things
and
if
anybody
asks
questions
you
may
say
that
you
have
my
permission
to
remain
here
until
the
girls
sat
at
attention
till
the
door
closed
upon
their
mistress
then
their
mingled
amazement
and
gratitude
burst
forth
good
old
gibbie
she
an
absolute
sport
never
known
her
in
such
a
jinky
mood
before
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
observed
raymonde
sagely
i
believe
gibbie
absolutely
loathes
mademoiselle
and
that
for
once
in
a
way
she
not
above
taking
a
legitimate
chance
of
paying
her
out
when
the
french
mistress
came
round
that
evening
on
her
tour
of
inspection
she
found
fauvette
drawers
in
order
right
to
the
very
bottoms
beads
ties
and
collars
carefully
arranged
in
boxes
and
nicely
mended
stockings
placed
in
a
row
it
only
show
vat
you
can
do
ven
you
try
she
commented
in
a
woman
to
be
untidy
is
ah
i
have
not
your
english
idiom
the
limit
wickedly
suggested
raymonde
who
was
standing
close
by
but
mademoiselle
who
had
been
warned
against
the
acquisition
of
slang
glared
at
her
till
she
beat
a
hasty
retreat
it
was
growing
near
to
the
end
of
the
term
and
examinations
loomed
imminently
on
the
horizon
they
were
to
be
conducted
this
year
by
miss
beasley
brother
a
clergyman
and
a
former
lecturer
at
oxford
he
had
made
a
special
study
of
modern
languages
so
that
his
standard
of
requirement
in
regard
to
french
grammar
was
likely
to
be
a
high
one
up
till
now
the
fifth
form
had
plodded
through
d√©jardin
exercises
in
an
easy
fashion
without
worrying
greatly
about
the
multitude
of
their
mistakes
over
which
their
mistress
had
indeed
shaken
her
head
but
had
made
no
special
crusade
to
amend
now
in
view
of
the
visit
of
the
reverend
beasley
mademoiselle
had
instituted
an
spurt
of
diligence
and
kept
her
pupils
with
reluctant
noses
pressed
hard
to
the
grindstone
irregular
verbs
and
exceptions
of
gender
seemed
much
worse
when
taken
in
such
large
doses
the
girls
began
to
wish
either
that
the
tower
of
babel
had
never
been
attempted
or
that
the
world
had
reached
a
sufficient
stage
of
civilization
to
adopt
a
universal
language
over
one
point
in
particular
they
considered
that
they
had
a
just
and
pressing
grievance
the
french
classes
of
form
v
came
on
the
from
to
being
the
last
subjects
of
morning
school
dinner
was
at
one
and
in
the
intervening
the
girls
put
away
their
books
washed
their
hands
and
tidied
their
hair
and
refreshed
their
flagging
spirits
by
a
run
round
the
garden
mademoiselle
had
been
wont
to
close
her
book
at
the
exact
minute
of
the
but
now
she
utterly
ignored
the
clock
and
would
go
on
with
the
lesson
till
a
quarter
or
even
ten
minutes
to
one
the
wrath
of
the
form
knew
no
bounds
they
valued
their
short
exercise
before
dinner
extremely
to
have
it
thus
cut
off
was
an
infringement
of
their
rights
mademoiselle
who
was
perfectly
aware
that
she
was
exceeding
the
limit
of
the
sheltered
herself
behind
excuses
ven
i
take
your
verbs
i
forget
it
is
so
late
she
would
remark
ze
lesson
slip
avay
and
ve
not
yet
done
all
ve
should
the
girls
held
an
indignation
meeting
to
discuss
the
subject
even
maudie
heywood
appetite
for
knowledge
was
glutted
by
this
extra
diet
of
french
syntax
and
muriel
fuller
and
magsie
mawson
amiable
nonentities
who
rarely
ruffled
the
surface
of
the
school
waters
for
once
verified
the
proverb
that
the
worm
will
turn
it
not
fair
raged
ardiune
knows
she
ought
to
stop
at
urged
magsie
in
injured
tones
it
taking
a
mean
advantage
echoed
muriel
and
we
ca
really
work
properly
when
she
goes
on
so
long
wailed
maudie
i
vote
we
strike
suggested
morvyth
fiercely
let
tell
her
we
wo
go
in
for
the
exam
at
all
if
she
goes
on
lengthening
out
the
lessons
several
of
the
form
brightened
up
at
the
suggestion
but
aveline
a
shade
more
practical
shook
her
head
discouragingly
if
we
do
there
be
a
fine
old
row
the
mosquito
appeal
to
the
bumble
who
have
her
back
up
directly
i
think
we
better
not
try
that
on
we
do
want
to
take
home
disgraceful
in
our
reports
ave
right
agreed
raymonde
we
know
the
bumble
this
is
a
matter
for
tact
not
brute
force
we
must
manage
mademoiselle
she
pretends
she
forgets
the
time
very
well
then
we
must
take
steps
to
bring
it
palpably
to
her
notice
will
you
leave
the
matter
in
my
hands
got
an
idea
raymonde
inspirations
were
so
well
known
in
the
form
that
the
rest
willingly
consented
to
appoint
her
as
a
of
one
to
undertake
the
full
management
of
the
affair
before
the
next
french
class
she
made
a
tour
of
the
monitresses
bedrooms
they
had
instituted
an
society
among
themselves
this
term
and
almost
everyone
was
provided
with
an
raymonde
boldly
borrowed
five
of
these
without
asking
leave
of
their
owners
and
set
them
all
carefully
for
winding
them
up
to
their
fullest
extent
she
then
placed
them
inside
the
book
cupboard
in
the
and
covered
them
with
some
sheets
of
exercise
paper
the
lesson
proceeded
even
more
painfully
than
usual
ardiune
got
hopelessly
mixed
between
indefinite
pronouns
and
indefinite
pronominal
adjectives
and
fauvette
floundered
over
the
negations
while
muriel
found
the
proper
placing
of
the
and
in
the
conjugation
of
an
impossible
problem
as
drew
near
there
was
much
glancing
at
mademoiselle
kept
her
eyes
persistently
turned
away
from
the
clock
with
the
evident
intention
of
once
more
ignoring
the
time
this
morning
however
fate
in
the
person
of
raymonde
had
been
against
her
exactly
at
the
five
alarums
started
punctually
inside
the
cupboard
raising
such
a
din
that
it
was
impossible
to
hear
a
word
mademoiselle
flew
to
investigate
took
them
out
shook
them
and
laid
them
on
their
backs
but
they
were
wound
up
to
their
fullest
extent
and
nothing
short
of
a
hammer
would
have
stopped
them
the
noise
was
terrific
the
baffled
french
governess
clapping
her
hands
over
her
ears
raised
her
eyebrows
in
a
signal
of
dismissal
and
the
girls
availed
themselves
of
the
permission
with
record
speed
the
alarums
burred
cheerily
on
for
about
twenty
minutes
after
which
by
instructions
they
were
replaced
in
the
monitresses
bedrooms
by
hermie
the
fifth
were
prepared
for
trouble
but
to
their
surprise
no
notice
was
taken
of
the
incident
at
possibly
mademoiselle
was
aware
that
her
late
efforts
at
discipline
were
regarded
by
miss
beasley
with
as
little
favour
as
her
former
slackness
and
considered
it
useless
to
appeal
to
her
principal
she
took
the
hint
however
and
in
future
terminated
the
lesson
punctually
at
the
so
on
this
occasion
the
girls
considered
that
they
had
most
decidedly
scored
chapter
xix
a
mysterious
happening
it
was
now
nearly
the
end
of
july
the
weather
which
for
many
weeks
had
been
fine
and
warm
suddenly
changed
to
a
spell
of
cold
and
wet
rain
dripped
dismally
from
the
eaves
the
tennis
courts
were
sodden
and
the
orchard
was
a
marsh
the
girls
had
grown
accustomed
to
spending
almost
all
their
spare
time
out
of
doors
and
chafed
at
their
enforced
confinement
to
the
house
they
hung
about
in
disconsolate
little
groups
and
grumbled
miss
beasley
who
was
generally
well
aware
of
the
mental
atmosphere
of
the
grange
registered
the
barometer
at
stormy
and
decided
that
prompt
measures
were
necessary
to
work
off
the
steam
of
the
school
she
suggested
a
good
game
of
and
gave
permission
for
it
to
be
played
on
those
upper
landings
which
were
generally
forbidden
ground
delighted
girls
started
at
once
upstairs
and
passed
through
the
wire
door
specially
unlocked
for
their
benefit
to
the
dim
and
mysterious
regions
that
lay
under
the
roof
it
was
the
best
place
in
the
world
for
the
purpose
long
labyrinths
of
passages
leading
round
into
one
another
endless
attics
and
innumerable
cupboards
the
smallness
of
the
latticed
windows
combined
with
the
wetness
of
the
afternoon
produced
a
twilight
that
was
most
desirable
and
highly
suited
to
the
game
hermie
and
veronica
picked
sides
and
the
former
band
stole
off
to
conceal
themselves
while
the
others
covered
their
eyes
in
orthodox
fashion
and
counted
a
hundred
cuckoo
we
coming
shouted
hermie
at
last
and
the
fun
began
up
and
down
and
in
and
out
diving
through
doorways
racing
along
passages
chasing
one
another
round
corners
groping
in
cupboards
panting
squealing
laughing
or
shuddering
the
girls
pervaded
the
upper
story
there
was
a
ghostly
gloom
about
the
old
place
which
made
it
all
the
more
thrilling
and
gave
the
players
a
feeling
that
at
any
moment
some
bogy
might
spring
upon
them
from
a
dark
recess
or
a
skinny
hand
be
stretched
downwards
through
a
flushed
excited
and
really
a
little
nervous
both
sides
at
last
sought
the
safety
of
the
den
two
or
three
of
them
began
to
compare
notes
they
were
joined
by
others
in
a
very
short
time
the
whole
school
knew
that
at
least
a
third
of
their
number
had
seen
a
something
they
were
quite
unanimous
in
their
report
it
was
a
girl
of
about
their
own
age
in
a
dress
with
a
wide
white
collar
hermie
and
ardiune
had
noticed
her
most
distinctly
she
had
smiled
and
beckoned
to
them
and
run
along
the
passage
but
when
they
turned
the
corner
she
had
disappeared
and
linda
and
elsie
whom
they
had
met
coming
in
the
opposite
direction
declared
that
they
had
seen
nobody
lois
and
katherine
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
as
they
chased
maudie
in
one
of
the
attics
and
joan
declared
positively
that
she
had
seen
her
flitting
down
the
stairs
it
queer
in
the
extreme
murmured
valentine
are
you
quite
sure
it
was
really
only
one
of
us
urged
meta
absolutely
declared
hermie
emphatically
we
all
have
on
our
brown
serges
and
i
tell
you
this
girl
was
in
dark
green
not
a
gym
costume
to
wear
over
a
blouse
like
ours
but
a
dress
with
long
sleeves
and
a
big
white
collar
i
do
believe
she
a
real
girl
at
all
faltered
magsie
tremulously
she
a
spook
magsie
voiced
the
opinion
of
the
majority
it
was
what
most
of
the
school
had
been
feeling
for
the
last
five
minutes
the
interest
in
the
supernatural
which
had
been
a
craze
earlier
in
the
term
until
sternly
repressed
by
miss
beasley
suddenly
revived
daphne
remembered
the
magazine
article
she
had
read
entitled
the
borderland
of
the
spirit
world
and
cold
thrills
passed
down
her
spine
veronica
ventured
the
suggestion
that
the
apparition
might
be
an
astral
body
or
an
elemental
entity
it
a
case
for
the
society
for
psychical
research
to
investigate
she
nodded
gravely
i
always
said
the
grange
was
bound
to
be
haunted
what
was
this
girl
like
asked
raymonde
reflectively
ancient
or
modern
modern
decidedly
she
had
on
a
green
dress
with
a
white
so
you
told
us
already
impatiently
we
know
about
her
clothes
what
was
she
like
hermie
stood
for
a
moment
with
eyes
shut
as
if
calling
up
a
mental
picture
about
ardiune
height
but
slimmer
rosy
face
and
dark
hair
done
in
a
plait
really
not
so
unlike
you
ray
only
i
should
say
decidedly
prettier
thank
you
sniffed
raymonde
that
just
about
sizes
her
up
agreed
those
who
had
seen
the
vision
she
did
look
spooky
at
all
continued
hermie
she
was
quite
substantial
you
could
see
through
her
and
she
did
melt
into
the
air
and
yet
she
disappeared
yes
she
certainly
disappeared
and
in
a
passage
where
there
were
no
doors
do
you
remember
the
story
i
told
you
of
the
lady
whose
astral
double
left
her
body
during
sleep
and
haunted
a
friend
house
began
veronica
darkly
do
tell
any
ghost
stories
up
here
do
implored
fauvette
i
have
hysterics
in
another
minute
i
frightened
whimpered
joan
i
vote
we
go
downstairs
suggested
morvyth
i
do
want
to
play
any
more
at
present
nobody
else
seemed
anxious
to
pursue
the
game
the
attics
were
too
charged
with
the
occult
to
be
entirely
pleasant
everybody
made
a
unanimous
stampede
for
the
lower
story
passing
down
the
winding
staircase
with
a
sense
of
relief
once
on
familiar
ground
again
things
looked
more
cheery
back
already
commented
miss
gibbs
who
had
met
them
on
the
landing
yes
we
all
er
a
little
tired
evaded
hermie
with
one
of
her
conscious
blushes
better
go
to
the
and
get
out
your
sewing
then
replied
the
mistress
eyeing
her
keenly
the
girls
proceeded
soberly
downstairs
still
keeping
close
together
like
a
flock
of
sheep
raymonde
however
lagged
behind
for
a
moment
or
two
she
stood
pondering
then
she
ran
swiftly
up
the
winding
staircase
again
into
the
attic
the
talk
of
the
school
that
evening
turned
solely
upon
the
ghost
girl
meta
who
had
not
seen
the
vision
declared
it
was
nothing
but
imagination
and
feared
that
some
people
were
apt
to
get
hysterical
at
which
hermie
retorted
that
no
one
could
be
further
from
hysteria
than
herself
and
that
six
independent
witnesses
could
scarcely
imagine
the
same
thing
at
the
same
moment
without
some
basis
for
their
common
report
veronica
considered
that
they
had
entered
unwittingly
into
a
psychic
circle
and
encountered
either
a
that
had
materialized
or
a
phantasm
of
the
living
some
people
have
capacities
for
astral
vision
that
others
possess
she
said
in
a
lowered
voice
it
quite
probable
that
hermie
may
be
clairvoyante
hermie
sighed
interestedly
it
was
pleasanter
to
be
dubbed
clairvoyante
than
hysterical
she
had
always
felt
that
meta
did
not
appreciate
her
we
none
of
us
been
trained
to
realize
our
spiritual
possibilities
she
replied
her
eyes
wide
and
thoughtful
while
a
few
girls
disbelieved
entirely
in
the
spectre
and
others
accepted
the
explanation
according
to
veronica
occult
theories
most
of
the
school
considered
the
attic
to
be
haunted
by
a
plain
ghost
such
as
anybody
might
expect
to
find
in
an
ancient
mansion
like
the
grange
they
waived
the
subject
of
modern
costume
deciding
that
in
the
dim
light
such
details
could
hardly
have
been
adequately
distinguished
and
that
the
apparition
must
have
been
a
cavalier
or
jacobite
maiden
whose
story
was
buried
in
the
oblivion
of
years
perhaps
her
lover
was
killed
commented
fauvette
with
a
quiver
of
sympathy
or
her
father
was
impeached
by
parliament
added
maudie
she
may
have
had
a
cruel
stepmother
who
her
sighed
muriel
softly
raymonde
alone
offered
no
suggestions
and
when
asked
for
her
opinion
as
to
the
explanation
of
the
mystery
shook
her
head
sagely
and
said
nothing
the
immediate
result
of
the
experience
was
that
veronica
went
to
miss
beasley
and
borrowed
antiquarian
survey
of
the
county
of
bedworthshire
including
a
description
of
its
castles
and
moated
houses
together
with
a
history
of
its
ancient
a
ponderous
volume
dated
which
had
before
been
offered
for
the
inspection
but
which
nobody
had
hitherto
summoned
courage
to
attack
she
studied
it
now
with
deep
attention
and
gave
a
digest
of
its
information
for
the
benefit
of
weaker
minds
less
able
than
her
own
to
grapple
with
the
stilted
language
the
school
preferred
lighter
literature
for
their
own
reading
but
were
content
to
listen
to
legends
of
the
past
when
told
by
veronica
who
had
rather
a
gift
for
narrative
and
could
carry
her
audience
with
her
as
the
next
afternoon
was
still
hopelessly
wet
the
girls
gathered
in
one
of
the
schoolrooms
with
their
sewing
and
were
regaled
with
a
story
while
they
worked
i
found
out
all
about
the
grange
began
veronica
it
belonged
to
a
family
named
ferrers
and
they
took
the
side
of
the
king
in
the
civil
war
while
sir
hugh
was
away
fighting
in
the
north
the
house
was
besieged
by
cromwell
troops
the
lady
of
the
manor
dame
joan
ferrers
had
to
look
after
the
defence
she
had
not
many
men
nor
a
great
deal
of
ammunition
and
not
nearly
as
much
food
as
was
necessary
she
at
once
put
all
the
household
upon
short
rations
and
drew
up
the
drawbridge
barred
the
great
gates
and
prepared
to
hold
out
as
long
as
she
possibly
could
she
knew
that
the
cavalier
forces
might
be
marching
in
the
direction
of
marlowe
at
any
time
to
relieve
her
and
that
if
she
could
keep
the
enemy
at
bay
even
for
a
few
weeks
the
grange
might
be
saved
the
utmost
vigilance
was
used
sentries
were
posted
in
the
tower
over
the
great
gate
and
the
lady
herself
constantly
patrolled
the
walls
with
so
small
a
garrison
it
was
a
difficult
task
for
the
men
had
not
adequate
time
to
rest
or
sleep
and
were
soon
nearly
worn
out
the
scanty
supply
of
food
was
almost
at
an
end
unless
help
should
arrive
within
a
few
days
they
would
be
obliged
to
capitulate
all
the
flour
was
gone
and
the
bacon
and
salted
beef
and
the
cocks
and
hens
and
pigeons
and
even
the
horses
had
been
killed
and
eaten
though
these
had
been
kept
till
the
very
last
the
worst
of
the
trouble
was
that
there
was
treachery
within
the
walls
dame
joan
was
well
aware
of
it
though
she
could
not
be
absolutely
sure
which
of
her
men
were
disaffected
for
they
all
still
pretended
loyalty
to
their
master
and
to
the
king
nobody
she
felt
was
really
to
be
trusted
though
the
walls
were
still
manned
and
the
cannon
blazed
away
with
what
ammunition
was
left
if
the
grange
were
to
be
saved
at
all
it
was
imperative
that
a
message
asking
for
help
should
be
conveyed
to
the
royalist
forces
but
how
could
it
be
taken
the
roundheads
were
encamped
all
round
the
walls
and
would
promptly
shoot
anyone
who
attempted
to
penetrate
their
lines
none
of
the
garrison
would
be
enough
to
venture
sir
hugh
eldest
son
was
away
fighting
with
his
father
but
there
was
a
daughter
at
home
a
girl
of
about
thirteen
named
joyce
she
came
now
to
her
mother
and
begged
to
be
allowed
to
take
the
message
it
was
a
long
time
before
dame
joan
would
give
her
consent
for
she
knew
the
terrible
danger
to
which
joyce
would
be
exposed
but
she
had
the
lives
of
her
younger
children
to
think
of
as
well
and
in
the
end
she
gave
her
reluctant
permission
just
when
it
was
growing
dusk
she
took
her
little
daughter
to
a
secret
doorway
in
the
panelling
from
which
a
subterranean
passage
led
underneath
the
moat
into
the
adjoining
wood
this
secret
passage
was
known
only
to
sir
hugh
and
his
wife
and
their
eldest
son
and
it
was
now
shown
to
joyce
for
the
first
time
it
was
a
horrible
experience
to
go
down
it
alone
but
she
was
a
brave
lassie
and
ready
to
risk
her
life
for
the
sake
of
her
mother
and
her
younger
brothers
and
sisters
she
took
a
lantern
to
guide
her
and
set
off
with
as
cheerful
a
face
as
she
could
show
the
air
was
stale
and
musty
and
in
some
places
she
felt
as
if
she
could
scarcely
breathe
her
footsteps
light
though
they
were
rang
hollow
after
what
seemed
to
her
a
very
long
way
she
found
herself
in
a
small
cave
and
could
catch
a
gleam
of
twilight
sky
through
the
entrance
she
at
once
extinguished
the
lantern
and
advanced
with
extreme
caution
she
was
in
the
wood
at
the
farther
side
of
the
moat
a
place
where
she
had
often
played
with
her
brothers
and
had
gathered
primroses
and
violets
in
the
springtime
she
could
recognize
the
group
of
tall
elms
and
knew
that
if
she
kept
to
the
right
she
might
creep
through
a
hole
in
the
hedge
and
make
her
way
across
some
fields
into
the
high
road
as
quietly
as
some
little
dormouse
or
night
animal
she
stole
along
not
far
off
she
could
see
the
great
camp
fire
round
which
the
troopers
were
preparing
their
supper
she
hoped
they
would
all
be
too
busy
with
their
cooking
to
notice
her
as
she
passed
behind
some
bushes
she
suddenly
caught
the
gleam
of
a
steel
helmet
within
a
few
yards
of
her
she
crouched
down
under
the
shelter
of
a
clump
of
gorse
but
in
doing
so
she
made
a
faint
rustle
who
goes
there
came
the
challenge
joyce
heart
was
beating
so
loudly
that
she
thought
it
must
surely
be
heard
the
sentry
listened
a
moment
then
levelling
his
pistol
sent
a
shot
through
the
gorse
bush
it
passed
within
a
few
inches
of
her
head
but
she
had
the
presence
of
mind
not
to
cry
out
or
move
evidently
thinking
he
was
mistaken
the
sentry
paced
farther
on
and
joyce
seizing
her
golden
opportunity
slipped
through
the
hole
in
the
hedge
still
using
the
cover
of
bushes
she
made
her
way
across
three
fields
and
reached
the
road
it
was
quite
dark
now
but
she
knew
her
direction
and
turned
up
a
where
she
would
be
unlikely
to
meet
troopers
all
night
she
walked
guiding
herself
partly
by
the
stars
for
she
knew
that
charles
wain
always
pointed
to
the
north
at
dawn
a
very
tired
and
little
maiden
presented
herself
at
the
gateway
of
hepplethorpe
manor
demanding
instant
audience
of
sir
roger
rivington
that
worthy
knight
and
loyal
supporter
of
the
crown
on
hearing
her
story
immediately
sent
horsemen
with
a
letter
to
general
bright
of
the
king
forces
who
lay
encamped
only
five
miles
off
and
he
marching
without
delay
for
marlowe
grange
surprised
the
parliamentarians
and
completely
routed
them
the
garrison
opened
the
great
gates
to
their
deliverers
with
shouts
of
joy
and
we
may
be
sure
welcomed
the
supplies
of
food
that
poured
into
the
house
later
on
as
for
joyce
she
must
have
been
the
heroine
of
the
family
is
that
all
asked
the
girls
as
veronica
paused
and
began
to
count
the
stitches
in
the
sock
she
was
knitting
all
that
in
the
book
and
i
embroidered
it
a
little
it
was
told
in
such
a
very
dull
fashion
so
i
put
it
in
my
own
words
it
quite
true
though
what
became
of
joyce
afterwards
she
married
sir
reginald
loveday
and
became
the
lady
of
clopgate
towers
the
tomb
is
in
byford
church
if
she
been
shot
by
the
trooper
i
should
have
thought
she
was
the
ghost
girl
commented
ardiune
i
do
quite
see
how
we
could
fix
that
up
though
it
does
seem
to
fit
you
quite
sure
she
escaped
perfectly
certain
how
else
could
the
grange
have
been
saved
veronica
argument
settled
the
question
but
the
girls
felt
that
the
dramatic
interest
of
the
situation
would
have
been
better
suited
if
the
story
had
ended
with
the
melancholy
death
of
the
heroine
and
her
subsequent
haunting
of
the
manor
i
always
heard
that
cromwell
soldiers
destroyed
the
walls
and
made
those
big
holes
in
the
gateway
with
their
said
morvyth
still
only
half
convinced
so
they
did
but
that
was
two
years
afterwards
and
the
children
were
all
sent
safely
away
before
the
second
siege
it
has
solved
the
mystery
of
the
ghost
girl
persisted
ardiune
ray
what
do
you
think
about
it
raymonde
lost
in
a
brown
study
started
almost
guiltily
and
recommenced
her
sewing
with
feverish
haste
think
why
it
a
pretty
story
of
course
what
more
can
i
think
why
ask
me
oh
i
do
know
except
that
you
generally
have
ideas
about
everything
who
can
the
ghost
girl
be
but
raymonde
having
lost
her
scissors
was
biting
her
thread
and
only
shook
her
head
in
reply
chapter
xx
the
coon
concert
at
the
end
of
the
summer
term
it
had
always
been
the
custom
of
the
school
for
each
form
to
get
up
a
separate
little
entertainment
at
which
the
other
forms
should
act
audience
this
year
it
was
unanimously
decided
not
only
to
keep
up
the
old
tradition
but
to
extend
the
original
plan
by
charging
for
admission
and
sending
the
proceeds
to
the
blinded
soldiers
fund
this
idea
appealed
greatly
to
the
girls
they
given
their
eyes
for
us
and
we
ought
to
do
something
for
them
declared
linda
emphatically
it
must
be
awful
to
be
blind
sighed
muriel
yes
and
some
of
them
are
such
lads
too
think
of
losing
your
sight
and
having
your
whole
career
ruined
when
you
only
nineteen
or
twenty
and
the
ghastly
prospect
of
living
years
and
years
and
years
till
you
quite
old
and
never
being
able
to
see
the
sun
again
and
the
flowers
and
your
friends
faces
or
anything
that
makes
life
beautiful
i
do
think
half
of
us
realize
what
our
soldiers
have
suffered
for
us
and
they
so
patient
and
cheerful
added
veronica
in
my
opinion
they
prove
their
heroism
as
much
by
the
way
they
bear
their
ruined
lives
afterwards
as
by
their
deeds
in
the
trenches
it
has
shown
what
stuff
british
folk
are
made
of
and
you
get
such
surprises
often
a
boy
whom
you
known
and
always
thought
weak
and
selfish
and
silly
will
turn
out
to
have
any
amount
of
grit
in
him
there
one
in
particular
a
friend
of
ours
he
cared
for
nothing
before
except
amusing
himself
the
kind
of
boy
who
always
getting
into
debt
and
doing
foolish
things
well
he
utterly
changed
he
not
like
the
same
fellow
i
think
the
war
will
have
made
a
great
difference
to
many
of
our
men
and
to
our
women
too
i
hope
said
miss
beasley
who
unnoticed
by
veronica
had
joined
the
group
it
would
be
a
poor
thing
for
the
country
if
only
the
men
came
purified
out
of
this
time
of
trouble
nation
rises
no
higher
than
its
women
and
now
is
woman
great
opportunity
i
think
she
is
taking
it
she
is
showing
by
her
work
in
hospitals
in
canteens
on
the
land
in
offices
or
in
public
service
how
she
can
put
her
shoulder
to
the
wheel
and
help
in
her
hour
of
need
i
believe
this
war
will
have
broken
down
many
foolish
old
traditions
and
customs
and
that
people
will
be
ready
afterwards
to
live
more
simple
natural
lives
than
they
did
before
the
of
are
the
women
of
and
it
is
on
you
that
the
nation
will
rely
in
years
to
come
do
ever
forget
that
try
to
prove
it
practically
miss
beasley
seldom
preached
to
the
girls
but
when
she
spoke
her
few
quiet
words
generally
had
their
effect
hermie
and
linda
in
especial
turned
them
over
in
their
minds
as
the
result
of
their
mistress
last
remark
they
made
a
suggestion
to
their
some
of
us
are
leaving
this
term
and
at
any
rate
in
a
few
years
we
shall
all
have
left
and
be
scattered
about
in
various
places
would
it
be
nice
to
make
a
kind
of
league
and
undertake
that
every
girl
who
has
belonged
to
this
school
will
do
her
very
best
to
help
the
world
it
should
be
a
grange
pledge
and
we
bind
ourselves
to
keep
it
if
a
whole
school
makes
up
its
mind
to
a
thing
it
ought
to
have
some
effect
and
it
would
be
splendid
to
feel
that
our
school
had
been
an
inspiration
and
helped
to
build
up
a
new
and
better
nation
after
the
war
there
are
only
of
us
here
at
present
but
suppose
when
we
leave
we
each
influence
ten
people
that
makes
two
hundred
and
sixty
and
if
they
each
influence
ten
people
more
it
makes
two
thousand
six
hundred
so
the
thing
grows
like
circles
in
a
pond
i
do
mean
that
we
to
be
a
set
of
prigs
and
go
about
criticizing
everybody
and
telling
them
they
are
slackers
that
not
the
right
way
at
all
but
if
we
stick
up
constantly
for
all
that
we
know
is
best
people
will
probably
begin
to
sympathize
and
want
to
do
the
same
hermie
and
linda
idea
appealed
to
the
sixth
they
instituted
the
league
at
once
and
persuaded
the
entire
school
to
join
they
put
their
heads
together
and
drew
up
a
short
code
which
they
considered
should
explain
the
attitude
of
their
society
it
ran
as
follows
marlowe
grange
league
rules
to
do
some
definite
sensible
work
and
not
to
spend
all
my
time
in
golf
dances
and
other
amusements
to
read
wholesome
books
study
nature
and
be
content
with
simple
pleasures
not
to
judge
my
friends
by
the
standards
of
clothes
and
money
but
by
their
real
worth
to
strive
to
be
and
to
look
at
things
from
other
people
points
of
view
as
well
as
my
own
to
do
all
i
can
to
help
others
to
understand
that
character
is
the
most
useful
possession
i
can
have
to
speak
the
truth
be
charitable
to
my
neighbours
faults
and
avoid
gossip
to
cultivate
and
cherish
the
faculty
of
appreciating
all
the
beautiful
in
life
and
to
enjoy
innocent
pleasures
to
realize
that
as
a
soldier
is
one
of
an
army
so
i
am
a
unit
of
a
great
nation
and
must
play
my
part
bravely
and
nobly
for
the
sake
of
my
country
to
remember
that
i
can
do
good
and
useful
work
in
my
own
home
as
well
as
out
in
the
world
to
keep
my
heart
open
and
take
life
cheerfully
kindly
and
smilingly
trying
to
make
my
own
little
circle
better
and
happier
and
to
forget
myself
in
pleasing
others
not
to
moan
and
groan
over
what
is
inevitable
but
to
make
the
best
of
things
as
they
are
to
be
faithful
to
my
friends
loyal
to
my
king
and
my
country
and
true
to
god
god
save
the
king
in
order
to
make
the
league
a
binding
and
lasting
affair
the
monitresses
decided
to
give
each
member
a
copy
of
the
code
and
ask
her
to
sign
her
name
to
it
for
this
purpose
they
made
dainty
little
books
of
exercise
paper
with
covers
of
cardboard
begged
from
the
drawing
cupboard
decorated
with
japanese
stencils
of
iris
chrysanthemums
birds
and
reeds
or
other
artistic
designs
the
backs
being
tied
with
bows
of
baby
ribbon
after
the
list
of
rules
were
appended
a
few
suitable
quotations
and
blank
pages
were
left
so
that
each
individual
could
fill
them
up
with
extracts
that
she
liked
either
cut
out
of
magazines
or
written
in
her
own
hand
most
of
the
girls
admired
robert
louis
stevenson
so
the
selections
began
with
his
wise
and
tender
epitome
of
life
to
be
honest
to
be
kind
to
earn
a
little
and
to
spend
a
little
less
to
make
upon
the
whole
a
family
happier
for
his
presence
to
renounce
when
that
shall
be
necessary
and
not
be
embittered
to
keep
a
few
friends
but
these
without
capitulation
above
all
on
the
same
grim
condition
to
keep
friends
with
himself
here
is
a
task
for
all
that
a
man
has
of
fortitude
and
delicacy
as
linda
and
hermie
could
not
agree
whether
this
ideal
of
life
or
the
one
by
william
henry
channing
was
the
more
beautifully
expressed
it
was
agreed
to
put
the
latter
as
well
to
live
content
with
small
means
to
seek
elegance
rather
than
luxury
and
refinement
rather
than
fashion
to
be
worthy
not
respectable
and
wealthy
not
rich
to
study
hard
think
quietly
talk
gently
act
frankly
to
listen
to
stars
and
birds
to
babes
and
sages
with
open
heart
to
bear
all
cheerfully
do
all
bravely
await
occasions
hurry
never
in
a
word
to
let
the
spiritual
unbidden
and
unconscious
grow
up
through
the
common
this
is
to
be
my
symphony
as
the
league
was
to
be
nothing
if
not
practical
everyone
felt
that
the
best
way
of
upholding
its
principles
at
the
present
moment
was
to
raise
a
good
collection
for
the
fund
for
the
blinded
soldiers
the
sixth
determined
to
give
a
theatrical
performance
the
juniors
a
display
of
gymnastics
and
dancing
and
the
fifth
concentrated
their
minds
upon
a
concert
it
not
to
be
just
an
ordinary
concert
said
ardiune
addressing
a
select
committee
of
management
it
must
be
something
extra
special
and
outside
such
as
we
never
had
before
in
the
school
so
rub
up
your
ideas
please
and
make
suggestions
i
waiting
rather
a
big
order
to
get
anything
entirely
new
grunted
morvyth
i
should
say
everything
on
the
face
of
the
earth
been
tried
already
but
not
here
how
you
catch
me
up
there
is
time
to
get
up
an
operetta
i
suppose
ventured
fauvette
hardly
in
three
days
a
patriotic
performance
had
one
only
last
term
so
it
would
come
stale
then
what
can
we
have
i
know
exclaimed
raymonde
bouncing
up
from
her
chair
and
taking
a
seat
upon
the
table
instead
i
vote
we
be
coons
what
coons
asked
katherine
ungrammatically
oh
you
stupid
you
know
you
sing
plantation
songs
and
wear
a
costume
and
wave
tambourines
and
that
sort
of
thing
do
we
black
our
faces
we
can
if
we
like
but
it
is
necessary
we
not
to
be
nigger
minstrels
exactly
coons
are
different
of
course
the
songs
are
all
about
sambos
and
dinahs
but
white
people
can
sing
them
with
quite
as
great
effect
i
believe
the
bumble
got
some
castanets
and
things
put
away
that
we
could
borrow
so
she
has
bags
me
the
cymbals
pity
nobody
can
play
the
banjo
never
mind
we
shall
do
very
well
with
the
piano
the
committee
having
decided
that
their
concert
was
to
be
a
coon
performance
the
girls
set
to
work
accordingly
to
make
preparations
all
the
songbooks
in
the
school
were
ransacked
to
find
plantation
melodies
and
after
much
discussion
not
to
say
quarrelling
a
programme
was
at
length
arranged
sufficiently
spicy
to
entertain
the
girl
portion
of
the
audience
but
select
enough
not
to
offend
the
easily
shocked
susceptibilities
of
miss
gibbs
whose
ideas
of
songs
suitable
for
young
ladies
ran
in
direct
opposition
to
most
of
her
theories
on
absolutely
early
victorian
lines
gibbie
notion
of
a
concert
is
sweet
home
and
ripe
and
perhaps
herrin
if
you
want
something
lively
pouted
ardiune
yes
and
even
those
have
to
be
edited
agreed
morvyth
do
you
remember
when
we
were
learning
ripe
she
insisted
on
our
changing
my
julia
lips
do
smile
into
the
sunbeams
sweetly
smile
and
she
would
let
us
sing
blue
bells
of
scotland
and
we
knew
it
was
just
because
it
began
where
tell
me
where
is
your
highland
laddie
gone
do
you
know
it
highly
improper
for
a
even
to
mention
a
laddie
murmured
katherine
ironically
how
about
the
blinded
soldiers
then
that
another
matter
i
suppose
look
here
let
take
our
programme
to
the
bumble
and
get
her
to
pass
it
beforehand
and
then
there
can
be
no
criticisms
afterwards
right
you
are
i
got
another
idea
propounded
raymonde
suppose
instead
of
having
our
concert
in
the
lecture
hall
we
ask
the
bumble
to
let
us
have
it
in
the
barn
instead
it
would
be
just
twice
as
coony
it
would
be
a
regular
stunt
agreed
the
committee
a
deputation
waited
upon
miss
beasley
and
found
her
quite
gracious
and
amenable
to
reason
both
in
respect
of
the
choice
of
plantation
ditties
and
the
use
of
the
barn
as
a
place
of
entertainment
she
even
vouchsafed
the
further
and
most
valuable
suggestion
that
they
might
supply
refreshments
and
charge
for
them
to
help
to
swell
the
funds
you
can
send
an
order
to
the
stores
at
gladford
for
cakes
and
biscuits
cook
shall
make
you
some
lemonade
and
you
may
have
the
oil
stove
in
the
barn
and
supply
cocoa
at
twopence
a
cup
may
we
sell
sweets
miss
beasley
asked
raymonde
tentatively
well
yes
i
do
see
why
you
should
you
may
put
down
chocolates
with
your
order
for
cakes
and
biscuits
if
you
like
the
delegates
made
a
cheerful
exit
from
the
study
and
hurried
to
communicate
their
good
tidings
to
the
rest
of
the
form
o
jubilate
we
make
a
night
of
it
commented
katherine
the
bumble
turned
into
an
absolute
great
were
the
preparations
for
the
event
costumes
had
to
be
contrived
a
difficult
matter
with
only
the
school
theatrical
box
to
draw
upon
and
ten
coons
to
be
turned
out
in
uniform
garb
the
usual
stock
properties
such
as
the
brigand
velvet
jacket
the
cocked
hat
or
the
hunting
were
utterly
useless
and
the
girls
had
to
set
their
wits
to
work
they
decided
to
wear
their
best
white
petticoats
with
white
blouses
and
to
make
hats
out
of
stiff
brown
paper
trimmed
with
rosettes
of
scarlet
crinkled
paper
obtainable
at
the
village
shop
using
bands
of
the
same
scarlet
for
belts
and
ties
of
course
we
rather
have
had
real
and
ribbons
but
if
you
ca
get
them
you
ca
and
there
an
end
of
it
and
you
must
just
make
up
your
mind
to
do
without
said
raymonde
philosophically
if
i
sing
too
hard
i
know
i
burst
my
waistband
objected
morvyth
who
always
looked
on
the
gloomy
side
of
events
then
do
sing
too
hard
and
do
take
any
refreshments
if
such
an
easily
expanding
figure
snapped
raymonde
we
could
stitch
the
crinkled
paper
over
an
ordinary
belt
and
then
it
would
break
through
suggested
valentine
scarlet
not
my
colour
mourned
fauvette
never
mind
baby
you
look
nice
in
anything
returned
aveline
soothingly
and
your
white
petticoat
a
perfect
dream
i
always
said
it
was
a
shame
to
wear
it
under
a
dress
the
entertainment
was
to
take
place
in
the
evening
after
preparation
and
on
the
afternoon
of
the
day
in
question
the
fifth
form
took
sole
and
absolute
possession
of
the
barn
turning
everybody
else
out
even
those
indignant
enthusiasts
who
were
at
work
at
the
bench
mind
our
tools
have
got
to
be
touched
or
we
have
something
to
say
called
out
daphne
as
she
made
an
unwilling
exit
i
shall
put
them
all
in
the
box
returned
morvyth
slamming
the
door
the
bench
had
to
serve
as
refreshment
table
so
it
was
cleared
with
scant
ceremony
in
spite
of
daphne
protest
a
clean
cloth
borrowed
from
the
cook
was
spread
upon
it
and
plates
of
cakes
and
biscuits
and
packets
of
chocolates
were
laid
out
as
attractively
as
possible
with
vases
of
flowers
between
raymonde
who
was
nothing
if
not
inventive
suddenly
evolved
a
new
and
enterprising
scheme
we
must
have
a
platform
she
decided
come
along
to
the
wood
pile
and
we
get
some
and
put
railway
sleepers
over
them
it
wo
take
us
long
it
turned
out
a
more
strenuous
business
than
she
had
anticipated
however
for
it
was
difficult
in
the
first
place
to
find
of
the
same
height
and
more
difficult
still
to
get
the
railway
sleepers
to
fit
neatly
together
on
the
top
of
them
i
hope
it
hold
up
said
aveline
dubiously
when
the
erection
was
at
last
complete
oh
it
just
have
to
hold
returned
raymonde
in
her
airiest
manner
i
think
it
nicer
than
a
stiff
platform
and
more
suitable
for
a
barn
it
looks
really
and
suggests
the
wild
west
and
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
immediately
after
preparation
the
coons
retired
to
make
final
arrangements
in
the
barn
the
big
stable
lanterns
were
lighted
and
hung
up
for
purposes
of
illumination
and
a
cauldron
of
water
was
set
upon
the
oil
it
was
a
horrible
scramble
for
time
was
short
and
they
still
had
to
change
their
dresses
everyone
seemed
in
everybody
else
way
and
each
gave
directions
to
the
others
though
nobody
was
in
authority
and
all
got
decidedly
cross
and
snapped
at
one
another
it
not
an
atom
of
use
sticking
up
that
lantern
unless
you
fill
it
first
urged
valentine
i
tell
you
it
almost
empty
and
wo
burn
twenty
minutes
you
do
want
to
perform
in
the
dark
i
suppose
it
ought
to
have
been
filled
before
grumbled
ardiune
here
give
me
the
paraffin
can
take
care
what
you
doing
you
slopping
into
the
cauldron
i
not
but
i
saw
you
we
shall
have
to
empty
out
the
cauldron
and
wash
it
and
refill
it
nonsense
interfered
raymonde
there
is
time
val
is
that
lantern
finished
then
hang
it
up
and
come
along
and
dress
we
shall
have
everybody
arriving
before
we
half
ready
almost
every
amateur
concert
begins
late
and
this
was
no
exception
to
the
rule
by
the
time
the
coons
had
scrambled
into
their
costumes
and
fauvette
had
got
her
best
white
petticoat
fastened
adequately
on
to
her
blouse
with
and
katherine
had
adjusted
her
tie
to
her
satisfaction
and
muriel
had
induced
her
paper
hat
to
tilt
at
the
right
angle
on
her
head
the
audience
was
clamouring
for
admission
at
the
door
of
the
barn
and
making
moral
remarks
on
the
subject
of
punctuality
we
awfully
sorry
panted
raymonde
in
excuse
undoing
the
padlock
which
the
coons
had
left
fastened
and
allowing
the
school
to
tramp
into
the
place
of
entertainment
your
shillings
please
yes
taking
the
money
first
thing
instead
of
handing
round
the
plate
in
the
interval
where
the
bumble
just
coming
now
with
gibbie
and
the
barn
with
its
dark
rafters
stable
lanterns
and
improvised
benches
certainly
looked
a
most
appropriate
setting
for
a
plantation
programme
and
miss
beasley
glanced
round
with
amused
interest
on
her
arrival
she
and
the
other
mistresses
were
escorted
to
special
posts
of
honour
and
the
performance
began
without
further
delay
everybody
admired
the
costumes
the
effect
was
quite
charming
especially
when
worn
by
all
ten
alike
and
the
paper
hats
with
their
big
rosettes
gave
a
coquettish
appearance
that
added
to
the
piquancy
of
the
songs
there
could
of
course
be
no
piano
accompaniment
but
the
girls
made
up
for
it
by
a
liberal
clashing
of
cymbals
rattling
of
castanets
and
jingling
of
tambourines
they
were
as
cute
and
coony
as
they
knew
how
to
be
putting
a
great
deal
of
action
into
the
songs
and
adding
a
few
comic
asides
at
raymonde
suggestion
they
had
decided
during
the
performance
of
the
darkies
frolic
to
dance
a
lively
kind
of
combined
and
measure
to
illustrate
the
words
they
had
practised
it
carefully
beforehand
and
considered
it
the
de
of
the
evening
but
alas
they
had
not
calculated
on
the
difference
between
the
firm
floor
of
the
barn
and
the
extremely
shaky
erection
on
which
they
were
perched
they
were
only
through
and
were
capering
in
most
approved
darky
fashion
when
the
middle
which
supported
the
planks
suddenly
gave
way
and
the
platform
collapsed
some
of
the
girls
sprang
off
in
time
but
several
went
down
among
the
ruins
and
were
rescued
by
the
agitated
mistresses
fortunately
without
real
injuries
though
there
were
scratches
and
bruises
and
at
least
half
a
yard
of
lace
was
torn
from
fauvette
best
petticoat
as
the
darkies
frolic
was
the
last
item
but
one
in
the
first
half
of
the
programme
and
the
performers
were
naturally
ruffled
by
their
unexpected
accident
miss
beasley
suggested
that
they
had
better
have
the
interval
at
once
and
soothe
their
feelings
with
cakes
and
cocoa
before
resuming
the
entertainment
the
little
spread
on
the
bench
looked
attractive
the
stores
had
sent
a
tempting
selection
of
cakes
and
the
audience
was
quite
ready
for
refreshment
ardiune
presiding
at
the
cauldron
mixed
cups
of
cocoa
as
speedily
as
possible
and
handed
them
out
in
exchange
for
twopences
at
the
first
sip
however
an
expression
of
acute
disgust
spread
itself
over
the
countenance
of
each
consumer
whew
choked
hermie
what
the
matter
with
the
stuff
it
simply
atrocious
it
tastes
of
paraffin
proclaimed
veronica
pulling
a
wry
face
there
i
told
you
so
whispered
valentine
to
ardiune
you
have
just
gone
and
done
it
this
time
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
matter
the
contents
of
the
cauldron
were
quite
undrinkable
and
the
girls
had
to
fall
back
on
the
small
quantity
of
lemonade
which
the
cook
had
provided
it
was
a
most
mortifying
experience
especially
happening
just
after
the
failure
of
the
platform
the
sixth
were
looking
amused
and
superior
the
juniors
were
grumbling
and
miss
beasley
was
saying
never
mind
so
long
as
we
help
the
blinded
soldiers
which
was
kind
but
not
altogether
comforting
the
audience
made
up
for
the
lack
of
cocoa
by
their
consumption
of
confectionery
and
went
on
buying
till
not
a
solitary
cake
or
packet
of
chocolate
was
left
upon
the
bench
the
second
half
of
the
programme
had
to
be
performed
upon
the
floor
but
went
off
nevertheless
in
quite
good
style
and
with
much
flourish
of
instruments
fauvette
with
her
torn
lace
hurriedly
pinned
up
piped
a
pretty
little
solo
about
piccaninnies
and
ole
mammies
aveline
and
katherine
gave
a
spirited
duet
and
the
troupe
in
general
roared
choruses
with
great
vigour
everybody
decided
that
the
evening
barring
the
cocoa
had
been
a
great
success
the
proceeds
in
particular
were
highly
satisfactory
one
pound
ten
shillings
announced
raymonde
just
count
it
over
somebody
please
to
make
sure
i
right
i
do
call
that
half
bad
for
a
form
concert
if
the
others
do
as
well
we
shall
have
quite
a
nice
sum
shall
i
give
it
to
the
bumble
now
she
gone
upstairs
besides
i
believe
it
gibbie
who
going
to
send
off
the
money
you
better
keep
it
till
the
others
have
had
their
entertainments
and
it
can
all
be
handed
in
together
i
take
it
and
lock
it
up
in
my
drawer
i
say
it
was
awful
fun
being
coons

the
examinations
were
drawing
most
horribly
and
imminently
near

the
fifth
form
feeling
themselves
for
the
most
part
ill
prepared
for
the
ordeal
were
shivering
in
anticipation
armed
with
textbooks
they
made
desperate
efforts

pull
up

stock
their
brains

of

over

while
the

tried
to

holes
where
they

says

at
the
end
of
the
term
and
we
must
use
waverleys
for
the
exam
there
a
whole
boxful
of

here
i
not
going
to
be

i
shall
send
for

with
a
broad
nib
i
saw
one
advertised
in
a
magazine
the
bumble
wo
let
you
i
sha
ask
her
then
how
you
get
it
oh
trust
me
i
manage
it
somehow
i
not
generally
easily
circumvented
when
i
set
my
mind
upon
anything
i
a
plan
already
have
you
what
is
it
ah
that
would
be
telling
laughed
raymonde
perhaps
my
pen
will
come
floating
in
through
the
window
you
mad
creature
i
do
believe
you
really
get
it
wait
and
see
the
fifth
form
possessed
a
little
upstairs
room
at
the
grange
which
they
called
their
sanctum
it
held
a
piano
and
was
mainly
used
for
practising
but
the
girls
sometimes
studied
there
out
of
preparation
hours
its
principal
article
of
furniture
was
a
large
bureau
which
miss
beasley
had
bought
among
other
things
when
she
took
over
the
house
she
had
given
every
girl
in
the
form
one
of
its
drawers
together
with
a
key
so
that
each
could
have
a
place
in
which
to
keep
any
special
treasures
locked
up
as
raymonde
sat
in
the
sanctum
that
afternoon
alone
trying
to
apply
her
mind
to
memorizing
certain
axioms
of
euclid
veronica
came
bustling
in
you
here
ray
miss
beasley
wants
some
change
to
pay
the
laundry
you
got
the
money
you
collected
at
your
coon
concert
last
night
can
you
let
her
have
thirty
shillings
in
silver
and
she
give
you
notes
instead
certainly
replied
raymonde
rising
at
once
and
unlocking
her
drawer
in
the
bureau
here
you
are
four
make
ten
shillings
eight
shillings

eighteen
and
sixpences

thirty
shillings
altogether
i
just
as
soon

said
veronica
i
bring
them
up
to
you
later
on
or
send
somebody
with
them
i
hope
our
entertainment
will
do
as
well
as
yours
by
the
by
a
queer
thing
happened
just
this
minute
i
saw
the
ghost
girl
again
where
asked
raymonde
excitedly
peeping
round
the
corner
of
the
winding
staircase
but
she
vanished
instantly
i
went
up
a
few
steps
but
could
see
her
the
wire
door
was
open
and
i
very
nearly
ran
up
to
the
attic
to
investigate
but
i
knew
miss
beasley
was
waiting
for
the
change
i
must
rush
and
give
it
to
her
now
or
there
be
squalls
raymonde
did
not
either
lock
up
her
drawer
or
resume
her
euclid
she
stood
for
a
moment
or
two
pondering
then
a
mischievous
light
broke
over
her
face
and
she
clapped
her
hands
splendiferous
i
do
it
she
said
aloud
and
whisking
out
of
the
room
she
ran
up
the
winding
staircase
and
through
the
open
wire
door
into
the
forbidden
but
fascinating
territory
of
the
attics
the
girls
at
the
grange
were
obliged
to
keep
strictly
to
their
practising
and
raymonde
was
due
at
the
piano
in
the
sanctum
from
until
at
which
was
fully
ten
minutes
late
the
strains
of
her
beethoven
sonata
began
to
resound
down
the
passage
mademoiselle
passing
from
her
bedroom
stood
for
a
moment
to
listen
she
was
impressed
by
the
fact
that
raymonde
was
playing
much
better
than
usual
and
performing
in
quite
a
stylish
fashion
the
passage
which
usually
baffled
her
she
almost
opened
the
door
to
congratulate
her
pupil
but
being
in
a
hurry
changed
her
mind
and
ran
downstairs
instead
a
little
later
veronica
also
in
much
haste
entered
the
room
with
hermie
miss
beasley
has
sent
the
notes
ray
she
explained
you
stop
i
just
pop
them
inside
your
drawer
and
you
can
put
them
away
properly
when
you
finished
practising
the
figure
at
the
piano
did
not
turn
her
head
or
attempt
to
reply
but
went
on
diligently
with
the
scherzo
movement
of
the
sonata
bringing
out
her
chords
crisply
and
executing
some
quite
brilliant
runs
raymonde
improving
enormously
in
her
music
commented
hermie
as
the
two
monitresses
went
back
along
the
passage
yes
agreed
veronica
and
how
remarkably
pretty
she
looked
her
hair
was
quite
curly
and
she
had
such
a
lovely
colour
did
you
notice
that
room
so
dark
i
ca
say
i
did
particularly
ray
not
bad
looking
though
i
do
call
her
exactly
a
beauty
she
looked
a
beauty
this
evening
fauvette
will
have
to
mind
her
laurels
she
always
been
the
belle
of
the
form
until
now
when
maudie
heywood
in
accordance
with
the
practising
came
at
to
claim
the
piano
she
found
the
sanctum
unoccupied
raymonde
drawer
in
the
bureau
was
shut
and
locked
this
fact
maudie
noticed
almost
automatically
at
the
moment
it
seemed
a
matter
of
no
consequence
though
in
the
light
of
after
events
it
was
to
assume
a
greater
importance
than
she
could
have
imagined
raymonde
turned
up
late
for
preparation
looking
hot
and
conscious
and
with
her
brown
serge
dress
only
half
fastened
she
gave
no
excuse
for
her
lack
of
punctuality
and
took
her
loss
of
order
mark
with
stoicism
what
were
you
doing
whispered
aveline
when
the
evening
work
was
over
and
the
books
were
being
put
away
raymonde
head
was
inside
her
desk
she
drew
it
out
and
seemed
on
the
point
of
uttering
a
confidence
then
suddenly
changing
her
mind
she
stooped
again
to
arrange
her
papers
little
girls
should
ask
questions
she
grunted
oh
very
well
flared
aveline
who
was
very
easily
offended
sure
you
need
tell
me
anything
if
you
do
want
to
thanks
i
sha
force
your
silly
secrets
from
you
you
certainly
wo
snapped
raymonde
as
aveline
flounced
away
there
was
no
time
for
further
bickering
the
juniors
were
giving
their
gymnastic
and
dancing
display
in
the
lecture
hall
and
miss
beasley
had
announced
that
she
wished
the
entertainment
to
begin
promptly
that
a
shot
at
us
sniggered
ardiune
i
know
the
coons
started
late
but
we
really
could
help
it
it
took
me
ages
to
help
fauvette
into
her
costume
not
to
speak
of
getting
into
my
own
as
well
the
fourth
are
only
performing
in
their
gym
dresses
so
it
easy
enough
for
them
to
be
punctual
i
stump
up
my
shilling
cheerfully
for
the
sake
of
the
blind
tommies
but
i
do
expect
much
of
a
show
for
my
money
worth
no
more
do
i
agreed
katherine
i
fed
up
with
swedish
drill
i
confess
my
interest
centres
in
the
refreshments
after
all
the
fifth
were
agreeably
surprised
at
the
achievements
of
the
performers
the
juniors
had
been
practising
in
private
under
the
instruction
of
miss
ward
the
visiting
athletics
mistress
and
had
quite
a
novel
little
programme
to
present
to
their
schoolfellows
they
exhibited
some
remarkably
neat
skipping
drill
and
also
some
charming
russian
and
polish
peasant
dances
and
a
variety
of
military
exercises
that
would
almost
have
justified
their
existence
as
a
volunteer
corps
it
was
a
patriotic
evening
with
much
waving
of
flags
and
allusions
to
king
and
country
even
the
refreshments
were
in
keeping
for
the
table
was
decorated
with
red
white
and
blue
streamers
and
there
were
on
sale
little
packets
of
chocolates
wrapped
up
in
representations
of
the
union
jack
the
cocoa
on
this
occasion
was
immaculate
and
everything
was
served
with
the
utmost
daintiness
quite
a
decent
business
for
the
kids
commented
ardiune
but
not
half
the
fun
of
our
coon
performance
it
was
ripping
in
the
barn
agreed
morvyth
there
remained
one
more
entertainment
in
aid
of
the
blinded
fund
that
of
the
sixth
form
which
was
expected
by
everybody
to
be
the
best
miss
beasley
had
thrown
it
open
to
outsiders
and
some
of
the
ladies
who
attended
the
geology
lectures
had
promised
to
come
and
bring
friends
in
view
of
this
augmented
audience
the
performers
made
efforts
they
held
frequent
rehearsals
with
closed
doors
and
took
elaborate
pains
to
prevent
impertinent
juniors
from
obtaining
the
least
information
as
to
their
plans
the
wildest
notions
circulated
round
the
school
it
was
rumoured
that
a
musical
comedy
was
to
be
presented
the
male
parts
being
taken
by
professional
actors
specially
engaged
from
london
for
the
occasion
then
that
failing
the
professionals
miss
beasley
and
miss
gibbs
had
consented
to
play
the
two
heroes
and
might
be
expected
to
appear
in
tights
with
flowered
waistcoats
and
cocked
hats
in
the
imagination
of
the
gossipmongers
professor
marshall
as
a
greek
tragedian
and
browne
garbed
as
a
highwayman
were
to
be
added
to
the
list
of
artists
it
was
even
whispered
that
the
reverend
beasley
who
was
booked
to
arrive
on
monday
had
consented
to
come
earlier
for
the
purpose
of
joining
in
the
festivities
and
would
appear
in
the
character
of
a
humorist
and
give
some
wonderful
exhibitions
of
lightning
changes
of
costume
and
ventriloquism
the
uncertainty
as
to
what
might
be
expected
certainly
enhanced
the
pleasure
of
anticipation
not
a
girl
would
have
missed
this
performance
for
worlds
the
sixth
kept
their
secret
well
not
a
word
leaked
out
as
to
the
true
nature
of
the
programme
meta
indeed
went
about
with
rather
mincing
steps
while
veronica
seemed
to
affect
a
truculent
attitude
but
whether
this
was
the
result
of
learning
parts
or
was
put
on
with
deliberate
intention
to
deceive
the
members
of
the
fifth
could
not
determine
the
entertainment
was
to
be
held
on
saturday
when
as
there
was
no
preparation
the
whole
evening
could
be
devoted
to
amusement
it
was
announced
to

at

if
barbara

at
the

of

not
insisted
upon
their
forming
an

she

mademoiselle
played
an

and
the
curtains
were
drawn
aside
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
play
being
amusing
from
first
to
last
the
audience
was
convulsed
the
actresses
threw
themselves
admirably
into

made

speeches
everybody
voted

evening
a
huge
success
the
visitors
heartily
congratulated
miss

upon
the
cleverness
of
her

pupils

hoped
they
would
sometimes
give
another
open
performance
the

clapped

barbara
after

chapter
xxii
an
accusation
on
the
following
monday
afternoon
the
reverend
beasley
arrived
in
readiness
to
begin
on
tuesday
morning
his
task
of
examining
the
school
there
was
great
fluttering
in
the
and
much
anxiety
on
the
part
of
the
girls
to
catch
the
first
glimpse
of
him
they
had
decided
that
as
the
brother
of
their
principal
he
would
be
tall
fair
and
with
classical
features
gentle
blue
eyes
and
a
soft
persuasive
manner
the
ideal
clergyman
in
fact
of
the
storybook
who
lives
in
a
picturesque
country
rectory
and
cultivates
roses
to
their
disappointment
he
was
nothing
of
the
sort
but
turned
out
to
be
a
short
little
man
with
a
grey
beard
and
moustache
and
keen
dark
eyes
under
bushy
eyebrows
and
a
prominent
nose
that
was
the
very
reverse
of
romantic
he
cleared
his
throat
frequently
in
a
nervous
fashion
and
when
he
spoke
he
snapped
out
his
remarks
abruptly
in
a
very
deep
voice
that
seemed
to
rise
almost
out
of
his
boots
he
is
half
as
nice
as
professor
marshall
decided
the
fifth
unanimously
looks
as
if
he
had
a
temper
ventured
fauvette
oh
it
cruelty
to
give
us
viva
voces
i
never
dare
to
answer
a
question
wailed
aveline
i
afraid
he
be
strict
admitted
katherine
perhaps
he
nervous
too
and
scared
of
us
suggested
morvyth
do
you
believe
it
laughed
raymonde
scornfully
i
flatter
myself
i
pretty
good
at
reading
faces
and
i
can
see
at
a
glance
he
a
martinet
that
frown
gives
him
away
and
the
kind
of
glare
he
has
in
his
eyes
i
a
believer
in
first
impressions
and
i
knew
in
a
second
i
was
going
to
like
him
aveline
sighed
dramatically
it
rough
on
a
poor
young
girl
in
her
early
teens
to
be
put
through
an
ordeal
by
a
stern
and
elderly
individual
who
have
absolutely
no
consideration
for
her
feelings
feelings
you
have
your
head
snapped
off
prophesied
raymonde
why
could
the
bumble
have
examined
us
herself
or
at
any
rate
let
the
professor
do
it
ask
me
a
harder
child
well
i
think
it
very
unnecessary
to
have
this
beasley
bumble
bee
indeed
he
a
regular
hornet
whatever
the
private
opinion
of
the
fifth
might
be
on
the
subject
of
their
examiner
they
were
obliged
to
hide
their
injured
feelings
under
a
cloak
of
absolute
propriety
the
reverend
visitor
was
a
solid
fact
and
all
the
grumbling
in
the
world
could
not
remove
the
incubus
of
his
presence
at
nine
on
tuesday
morning
he
would
begin
his
inquisition
and
the
girls
judged
that
there
would
be
scant
mercy
for
any
sinner
who
failed
to
reach
the
required
standard
a
terrible
atmosphere
of
gloomy
convention
pervaded
the
school
miss
beasley
was
anxious
for
her
pupils
to
appear
at
their
very
best
before
her
scholarly
brother
whose
ideal
of
maidenly
propriety
was
almost
medi√¶val
and
she
kept
a
keen
eye
on
their
behaviour
nobody
dared
to
speak
at
except
a
whispered
request
for
such
necessary
articles
as
salt
and
butter
laughter
was
out
of
the
question
and
even
a
smile
was
felt
to
be
inappropriate
the
girls
sat
subdued
and
demure
outwardly
the
pink
of
propriety
but
inwardly
smouldering
and
listened
obediently
while
the
visitor
mindful
of
his
educational
position
in
the
establishment
held
forth
upon
subjects
calculated
to
improve
their
minds
i
do
believe
gibbie
likes
him
either
opined
katherine
after
monday
night
supper
of
course
not
he
beats
her
on
her
own
ground
as
for
the
bumble
she
quite
distraught
she
keeps
glancing
at
us
as
if
she
expected
somebody
all
the
time
to
spill
her
tea
or
break
a
plate
or
pull
a
face
or
do
something
dreadful
we
not
usually
an
set
he
getting
on
my
nerves
complained
aveline
the
place
is
more
like
a
reformatory
than
a
school
growled
morvyth
when
the
arrived
on
tuesday
morning
it
contained
among
other
letters
and
parcels
a
small
narrow
packet
directed
to
miss
armitage
miss
gibbs
whose
business
it
was
to
overlook
her
correspondence
was
in
a
particular
hurry
as
it
happened
and
inclined
for
once
to
scamp
her
duties
what
this
raymonde
she
asked
perfunctorily
a
fountain
pen
did
you
say
for
the
exams
i
suppose
your
mother
has
sent
it
there
are
two
letters
for
aveline
and
one
for
morvyth
you
may
take
them
to
them
and
tell
daphne
i
want
to
speak
to
her
raymonde
did
not
stop
for
further
interrogation
she
beat
as
speedy
a
retreat
as
possible
delivered
the
message
and
the
letters
and
finished
unpacking
her
parcel
her
form
mates
more
inquisitive
than
miss
gibbs
gathered
round
her
and
began
to
catechize
what
have
you
got
there
did
it
come
by
the
post
why
it
a
fountain
pen
is
it
who
sent
it
to
you
did
you
buy
it
then
it
looks
a
jolly
nice
one
is
it
full
or
empty
do
talk
all
at
once
children
commanded
raymonde
loftily
answer
your
questions
in
proper
order
so
just
behave
yourselves
it
is
a
fountain
pen
as
anybody
with
half
an
eye
could
see
it
came
by
the
post
nobody
sent
it
to
me
i
bought
it
it
is
a
jolly
nice
one
i
have
reason
to
believe
it
is
empty
i
going
to
fill
it
out
of
fauvette
bottle
cheek
returned
fauvette
allowing
her
friend
to
help
herself
to
the
swan
ink
however
what
puzzles
me
is
how
you
managed
to
buy
it
your
little
head
baby
is
easily
puzzled
smiled
raymonde
serenely
it
meant
to
wear
fluffy
curls
and
not
to
engage
itself
in
abstruse
problems
i
do
advise
you
to
worry
yourself
over
this
unless
you
can
turn
it
to
some
account
if
the
hornet
should
ask
you
for
an
original
example
you
might
begin
a
represent
a
fountain
pen
and
b
my
schoolmate
c
standing
for
an
unknown
quantity
fauvette
at
this
point
placed
her
hand
over
her
chum
mouth
stop
it
she
begged
beseechingly
if
i
get
any
of
those
wretched
a
b
and
c
questions
i
collapse
and
disgrace
the
form
i
many
weak
points
but
mathematics
are
absolutely
my
weakest
of
all
if
you
frighten
me
any
more
i
sha
have
the
courage
to
walk
into
the
exam
room
do
i
look
presentable
are
my
hands
clean
and
is
my
hair
decent
you
look
so
much
more
than
presentable
that
anybody
but
a
hardened
brute
of
an
examiner
would
be
bowled
over
by
you
utterly
and
entirely
i
sure
he
has
any
feelings
so
it
no
use
trying
to
work
upon
them
said
fauvette
plaintively
joking
apart
ray
where
did
you
get
that
fountain
pen
asked
morvyth
raymonde
eyes
twinkled
little
flower
could
i
tell
you
that
i
tell
you
my
heart
secret
with
it
she
misquoted
but
do
tell
me
i
think
you
might
the
more
you
tease
the
less
you
find
out
the
school
bell
put
an
end
to
the
conversation
and
the
girls
with
straightened
faces
marched
to
their
places
in
the
big
lecture
hall
the
reverend
beasley
had
taken
full
command
of
the
examinations
and
had
introduced
several
innovations
on
former
occasions
each
form
had
sat
and
written
in
its
own
room
but
now
desks
had
been
placed
for
the
whole
school
together
and
were
so
arranged
that
the
forms
sat
alternately
a
junior
being
sandwiched
between
each
senior
the
girls
were
hugely
insulted
he
suspects
we
copy
each
other
papers
thought
raymonde
and
flashed
her
indignation
along
to
aveline
she
did
not
speak
but
her
expressive
glance
drew
forth
a
reproof
from
the
examiner
he
cleared
his
throat
any
girl
communicating
either
by
speech
or
otherwise
will
be
dismissed
from
the
room
he
announced
freezingly
after
that
the
girls
scarcely
dared
to
look
up
from
their
papers
they
studied
their
questions
and
wrote
away
some
fast
and
furiously
and
others
with
the
desponding
leisure
of
those
having
very
little
to
put
down
beasley
sat
upon
the
platform
toying
with
his
and
keeping
his
eye
upon
the
movements
of
the
candidates
fauvette
finishing
long
before
the
others
ventured
to
raise
her
eyes
as
high
as
his
boots
and
let
them
rest
there
marvelling
at
the
size
and
thickness
of
the
footgear
and
congratulating
herself
that
she
could
wear
number
three
the
morning
wore
itself
slowly
away
when
the
school
compared
notes
at
the
girls
agreed
that
they
had
never
in
their
lives
before
been
given
such
an
atrocious
and
detestable
set
of
examination
papers
the
sixth
had
fared
as
badly
as
the
fifth
or
the
juniors
and
even
monitresses
were
loud
in
their
complaints
certain
viva
voces
taken
in
the
afternoon
confirmed
their
ill
opinion
of
their
examiner
he
glares
at
one
till
one
frightened
out
of
one
wits
and
he
hurries
so
one
has
time
to
answer
and
he
takes
things
in
quite
a
different
way
from
what
gibbie
does
he
no
need
to
be
sarcastic
sarcastic
did
you
say
i
call
him
downright
rude
he
evidently
does
think
much
of
our
intellects
well
we
do
think
much
of
him
anyway
i
believe
he
uses
pomatum
on
his
hair
confided
fauvette
in
a
shocked
whisper
my
dear
i
believe
it
bear
grease
corrected
morvyth
scornfully
this
is
the
most
painful
week
i
ever
had
to
go
through
in
all
my
life
bleated
aveline
even
if
i
live
through
it
and
doubtful
i
shall
be
a
nervous
wreck
they
have
to
send
me
for
a
rest
cure
during
the
holidays
i
not
accustomed
to
be
as
if
i
were
a
criminal
in
the
dock
it
a
witness
child
you
mean
amended
raymonde
criminals
generally
give
evidence
against
themselves
but
we
understand
you
all
the
same
for
two
pins
i
sham
utter
ignorance
and
give
him
some
very
surprising
answers
yes
i
would
if
gibbie
or
the
bumble
stick
in
the
room
the
whole
time
that
the
worst
of
it
they
know
in
a
second
that
i
was
only
having
him
on
as
the
week
progressed
the
school
considered
itself
more
and
more
the
fact
was
that
the
reverend
beasley
was
accustomed
to
university
students
and
could
not
focus
his
mind
to
the
intellectual
range
of
girls
of
thirteen
to
seventeen
moreover
he
was
by
nature
a
reformer
he
liked
to
give
others
the
benefit
of
his
advice
and
he
had
much
to
say
in
private
to
his
sister
upon
the
subject
of
her
pupils
lessons
and
general
management
perhaps
poor
miss
beasley
had
not
expected
quite
so
much
criticism
she
was
accustomed
nevertheless
to
defer
to
her
brother
opinions
and
she
listened
with
due
humility
though
with
much
inward
perturbation
while
he
laid
down
the
law
upon
the
education
of
women
miss
gibbs
who
was
a
born
fighter
was
inclined
to
argue
a
disastrous
policy
which
so
nearly
ended
in
what
are
generally
termed
words
that
her
principal
was
obliged
to
ask
her
privately
to
allow
the
visitor
to
state
his
views
uninterrupted
the
school
was
so
taken
up
with
the
stern
business
on
hand
that
such
delights
as
coon
concerts
and
theatricals
were
quite
in
the
background
on
thursday
afternoon
however
veronica
sought
out
raymonde
i
want
your
money
for
the
blinded
soldiers
fund
she
said
given
in
ours
and
so
have
the
juniors
miss
beasley
says
when
she
has
it
all
she
write
a
cheque
for
the
amount
and
send
it
to
the
secretary
but
miss
beasley
has
our
money
already
objected
raymonde
you
remember
she
said
she
wanted
some
change
and
you
came
and
asked
me
for
it
so
i
did
and
brought
you
back
notes
instead
raymonde
shook
her
head
you
certainly
did
what
nonsense
ray
you
know
i
brought
them
protested
veronica
indignantly
you
were
practising
and
i
said
stop
i
put
them
inside
your
drawer
hermie
was
with
me
at
the
time
a
conscious
look
spread
over
raymonde
face
she
blushed
hotly
was
it
last
friday
she
asked
quickly
of
course
it
was
friday
the
notes
must
be
in
your
drawer
have
you
the
key
then
come
along
and
we
go
and
find
them
raymonde
unwillingly
followed
veronica
upstairs
her
manner
was
embarrassed
in
the
extreme
she
unlocked
her
drawer
in
the
bureau
and
turned
out
the
possessions
she
had
there
but
no
notes
were
among
them
what
become
of
them
demanded
veronica
sharply
i
i
really
do
know
faltered
raymonde
then
you
must
find
out
as
treasurer
for
your
form
you
are
responsible
you
sure
you
put
them
in
my
drawer
and
not
in
anybody
else
certain
it
was
the
bottom
one
on
the
side
and
it
was
open
just
as
you
left
it
when
you
gave
me
the
silver
i
could
be
mistaken
raymonde
flung
herself
down
on
a
chair
and
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
i
want
to
think
she
murmured
veronica
gazed
at
her
with
growing
suspicion
i
sorry
but
it
my
duty
to
report
this
to
miss
beasley
she
remarked
freezingly
oh
no
please
pleaded
raymonde
starting
up
in
great
agitation
ca
you
give
me
just
a
few
days
and
then
well
perhaps
it
will
be
all
right
leave
it
over
till
saturday
it
will
be
all
wrong
said
the
monitress
sternly
i
understand
you
raymonde
for
either
you
have
the
money
or
you
have
if
you
have
you
must
hand
it
over
and
if
you
have
got
to
find
out
where
it
gone
that
flat
so
come
along
with
me
at
once
to
the
study
the
principal
on
being
told
the
facts
of
the
case
was
astonished
and
distressed
there
may
possibly
be
some
misunderstanding
she
urged
before
anybody
is
accused
we
will
make
sure
that
the
notes
were
not
placed
in
a
wrong
drawer
tell
every
member
of
the
fifth
to
come
at
once
to
the
and
bring
her
keys
you
will
go
upstairs
with
me
raymonde
veronica
message
spread
consternation
through
the
form
the
girls
trooped
to
the
sanctum
with
scared
faces
they
found
miss
beasley
there
looking
very
grave
and
raymonde
her
eyes
downcast
and
her
mouth
set
in
its
most
obstinate
mould
standing
by
the
bureau
i
wish
you
each
to
unlock
your
drawer
in
my
presence
said
the
principal
the
money
collected
at
your
concert
is
missing
and
perhaps
it
may
have
been
misplaced
in
dead
silence
the
girls
complied
every
one
in
turn
showing
her
possessions
there
were
certainly
no
notes
among
them
miss
beasley
turned
to
veronica
what
time
was
it
when
you
took
up
the
money
about
five
minutes
to
six
miss
beasley
it
was
just
before
i
went
into
preparation
hermie
was
with
me
did
you
leave
the
drawer
open
or
shut
i
shut
it
but
did
not
lock
it
raymonde
keys
were
dangling
in
it
i
thought
she
would
lock
it
for
herself
when
she
had
finished
practising
who
came
into
the
room
next
maudie
heywood
then
maudie
did
you
notice
the
keys
hanging
in
the
drawer
when
you
arrived
at
no
miss
beasley
they
were
certainly
not
there
thank
you
girls
you
may
go
now
veronica
tell
hermie
to
go
to
my
study
and
wait
for
me
raymonde
you
will
stay
here
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
alone
the
principal
waited
until
the
door
had
closed
on
her
other
pupils
then
turned
to
the
little
figure
near
the
bureau
raymonde
this
is
a
sad
business
she
said
solemnly
you
had
better
confess
at
once
that
you
have
taken
this
money
chapter
xxiii
a
mystery
unravelled
raymonde
started
and
faced
the
principal
with
flaming
eyes
i
did
i
did
she
protested
then
where
is
it
that
i
do
know
perhaps
you
will
explain
continued
miss
beasley
watching
her
searchingly
how
it
is
that
you
were
seen
at
marlowe
post
office
on
friday
afternoon
and
that
you
bought
a
postal
order
for
twelve
and
sixpence
oh
raymonde
you
may
well
blush
west
was
calling
only
an
hour
ago
and
told
me
that
she
had
seen
you
in
the
shop
she
asked
if
i
knew
about
it
or
if
you
had
been
there
without
leave
why
did
you
get
a
postal
order
raymonde
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
to
send
for
a
fountain
pen
she
stammered
you
admit
that
you
visited
the
post
office
now
i
know
that
you
had
finished
all
your
you
drew
the
last
of
your
allowance
from
me
on
the
day
of
your
concert
i
had
a
of
my
own
put
away
in
my
handkerchief
case
my
uncle
gave
it
to
me
last
holidays
if
that
is
so
then
where
is
the
money
for
which
you
were
treasurer
i
do
know
raymonde
i
ca
believe
such
a
story
you
not
telling
me
the
truth
indeed
indeed
i
am
burst
out
raymonde
oh
what
shall
i
do
i
ca
explain
and
i
ca
say
any
more
if
you
only
wait
a
few
days
indeed
i
shall
not
wait
returned
the
headmistress
coldly
the
matter
must
be
investigated
at
once
miss
beasley
greatly
upset
by
such
a
happening
in
her
school
consulted
her
brother
as
to
her
best
course
to
pursue
on
learning
the
circumstances
he
took
a
very
grave
view
of
the
case
there
little
doubt
of
the
girl
guilt
he
declared
she
evidently
yielded
to
a
sudden
temptation
she
wanted
a
fountain
pen
in
time
for
the
examinations
and
she
borrowed
the
notes
which
had
been
left
in
her
charge
in
order
to
send
for
it
probably
she
wrote
home
for
more
money
and
expected
to
be
able
to
replace
it
and
that
is
the
explanation
of
her
asking
for
a
few
days
grace
it
seems
to
me
as
clear
as
daylight
and
i
should
deal
with
her
as
she
deserves
may
i
ask
one
question
said
miss
gibbs
who
also
had
been
called
to
the
conclave
how
is
it
that
west
affirms
that
she
saw
raymonde
in
the
post
office
at
six
on
friday
while
veronica
and
hermie
declare
that
at
five
minutes
to
six
she
was
sitting
at
the
piano
in
the
it
is
not
possible
to
reach
the
village
in
five
minutes
miss
beasley
started
this
aspect
of
the
matter
had
not
occurred
to
her
it
very
perplexing
she
murmured
raymonde
has
been
troublesome
continued
miss
gibbs
but
i
have
always
found
her
scrupulously
straight
and
truthful
such
a
lapse
as
this
seems
to
me
utterly
foreign
to
her
character
you
never
know
what
a
girl
will
do
till
she
tried
commented
the
rev
beasley
better
expel
her
at
once
as
a
warning
to
the
others
give
her
a
chance
pleaded
miss
gibbs
the
evidence
is
really
so
unsatisfactory
wait
a
day
or
two
and
see
if
we
can
sift
it
i
wish
i
knew
what
is
best
vacillated
the
principal
it
is
so
near
the
end
of
the
term
that
it
seems
a
pity
to
send
raymonde
home
till
next
week
when
she
would
be
going
in
any
case
i
will
call
at
the
post
office
and
make
enquiries
as
to
the
exact
time
she
came
there
last
friday
i
think
i
wo
decide
anything
before
saturday
miss
beasley
stuck
to
this
determination
in
spite
of
her
protests
against
and
lack
of
discipline
she
excused
herself
on
the
ground
that
she
did
not
wish
to
disturb
the
examinations
which
were
to
continue
until
friday
evening
meanwhile
raymonde
was
in
the
position
of
a
remanded
prisoner
at
the
bar
she
was
not
allowed
to
mingle
with
the
rest
of
the
school
she
was
conducted
under
mademoiselle
escort
to
her
place
in
the
examination
hall
but
spent
the
remainder
of
her
time
in
the
which
served
as
a
temporary
jail
her
meals
were
sent
up
to
her
and
no
girl
was
allowed
under
penalty
of
expulsion
to
attempt
to
communicate
with
her
she
was
not
permitted
to
go
to
the
dormitory
at
night
but
slept
on
a
in
miss
naturally
the
episode
was
the
talk
of
the
school
its
interest
eclipsed
even
the
horror
of
the
examinations
it
seemed
a
mystery
which
no
one
could
disentangle
the
girls
remembered
only
too
well
that
raymonde
had
been
very
secretive
about
how
she
had
obtained
the
fountain
pen
but
on
the
other
hand
witnesses
declared
that
they
had
seen
her
both
at
the
post
office
and
in
the
when
she
certainly
could
not
have
been
in
two
places
at
once
the
fifth
decided
that
the
reverend
beasley
must
be
at
the
bottom
of
it
there
had
never
been
any
disturbances
before
he
came
to
the
school
and
since
his
arrival
everything
had
been
unpleasant
therefore
he
must
be
distinctly
responsible
for
misfortunes
which
was
hardly
a
reasonable
conclusion
however
loyal
it
might
be
to
their
friend
the
mystics
talked
the
matter
over
in
private
and
suggested
many
bold
but
quite
impracticable
schemes
such
as
subscribing
the
missing
money
amongst
them
or
throwing
up
a
to
the
sanctum
window
for
raymonde
to
escape
by
neither
of
which
plans
would
have
cleared
her
character
raymonde
herself
preserved
an
extraordinary
attitude
of
obstinacy
she
utterly
refused
to
give
any
more
explanations
she
did
not
cry
but
there
was
a
grey
misery
in
her
face
that
was
worse
than
tears
she
walked
in
and
out
of
the
examination
hall
with
her
head
proudly
erect
her
comrades
with
surreptitious
sympathy
glanced
up
as
she
passed
but
under
the
lynx
eye
of
their
examiner
were
unable
to
convey
to
her
the
notes
which
several
of
them
at
least
had
prepared
ready
to
pass
under
the
desk
on
friday
afternoon
raymonde
was
sitting
alone
in
the
when
the
door
was
unlocked
and
veronica
entered
with
a
tray
i
come
to
bring
your
tea
explained
the
monitress
i
really
know
whether
i
supposed
to
be
allowed
to
talk
to
you
but
miss
beasley
did
tell
me
not
to
so
i
shall
look
here
ray
why
do
you
end
this
wretched
business
i
only
wish
i
could
groaned
raymonde
but
you
can
there
something
behind
it
all
i
sure
take
my
advice
and
explain
it
to
miss
beasley
she
be
quite
decent
about
it
raymonde
shook
her
head
sadly
and
silently
yes
she
would
if
you
only
confess
i
ca
understand
you
ray
you
were
always
a
madcap
but
you
never
did
anything
underhand
or
sneaky
before
even
when
you
were
naughtiest
you
were
quite
square
and
thank
you
smiled
raymonde
faintly
i
ca
think
why
you
should
have
changed
and
conceal
everything
ray
i
appeal
to
your
best
side
you
signed
our
marlowe
grange
league
and
seemed
quite
enthusiastic
about
it
at
the
time
wo
you
try
to
live
up
to
it
now
raymonde
rose
to
her
feet
in
her
eyes
were
two
smouldering
fires
you
ca
understand
her
voice
was
trembling
with
passion
exactly
because
i
signed
that
paper
and
promised
to
be
faithful
to
my
friends
and
to
speak
the
truth
that
i
in
all
this
trouble
no
i
tell
you
i
wo
explain
if
you
think
so
badly
of
me
that
you
believe
my
word
it
no
use
my
speaking
to
you
oh
i
hate
everybody
and
i
hate
everything
i
wish
i
could
go
home
better
stay
and
clear
things
up
said
veronica
if
i
could
do
anything
for
you
i
would
would
you
asked
raymonde
with
a
flash
of
hope
could
you
possibly
get
a
letter
posted
for
me
veronica
shook
her
head
i
dare
she
said
briefly
miss
beasley
trusted
me
to
bring
up
your
tea
and
i
must
forget
i
a
monitress
i
shall
have
to
tell
her
that
i
been
speaking
to
you
i
ought
to
go
now
raymonde
drank
her
tea
but
left
the
bread
and
butter
untouched
she
was
not
hungry
and
her
head
ached
the
whole
of
her
gay
careless
world
seemed
to
have
crumbled
to
ashes
she
wondered
what
her
chums
were
thinking
of
her
did
they
like
veronica
mistrust
her
conduct
she
knew
that
her
behaviour
was
extraordinary
a
sense
of
utter
desolation
swept
over
her
and
pushing
aside
the
tea
things
she
leaned
her
arms
on
the
table
with
her
hot
face
pressed
against
them
from
this
despairing
attitude
she
was
aroused
by
miss
gibbs
who
five
minutes
later
came
to
fetch
the
tray
do
give
way
raymonde
said
the
mistress
laying
quite
a
kindly
hand
on
the
girl
shoulder
there
to
be
proper
enquiry
into
this
matter
and
i
for
one
trust
you
be
able
to
clear
yourself
keep
your
and
be
prepared
to
answer
any
questions
that
are
put
to
you
then
remember
there
nothing
like
courage
and
speaking
the
truth
illustration
the
door
opened
with
a
forcible
jerk
and
a
stranger
entered
raymonde
raised
herself
slowly
hesitated
for
a
moment
then
fumbled
in
her
pocket
miss
gibbs
she
faltered
i
love
to
tell
you
everything
but
i
ca
i
wonder
if
you
trust
me
enough
to
send
off
this
letter
without
opening
it
or
asking
me
what
i
written
in
it
the
mistress
took
the
envelope
and
examined
it
it
was
addressed
to
miss
chalmers
haversedge
manor
near
byfield
she
looked
into
raymonde
eyes
as
if
she
would
read
her
very
soul
her
pupil
bore
the
scrutiny
without
flinching
it
is
a
most
unwarrantable
thing
to
ask
but
i
will
do
it
replied
miss
gibbs
i
hope
my
confidence
in
you
will
be
justified
at
on
the
following
morning
a
trap
arrived
at
the
grange
to
convey
the
reverend
beasley
and
his
gladstone
bag
to
the
railway
station
a
row
of
heads
peeping
from
behind
the
curtains
in
the
upper
windows
watched
him
depart
and
exhibited
manifestations
of
intense
satisfaction
there
he
actually
gone
only
hope
he
wo
miss
his
train
and
come
back
no
no
he
in
heaps
of
time
thank
goodness
glad
he
is
staying
the
he
got
to
preach
somewhere
in
aid
of
something
on
sunday
may
he
never
come
here
again
that
all
perhaps
in
secret
miss
beasley
was
equally
relieved
she
had
passed
a
strenuous
week
and
had
possibly
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
she
was
on
the
whole
capable
of
arranging
her
own
school
to
the
satisfaction
of
herself
and
the
parents
of
her
pupils
she
considered
that
she
understood
girls
better
than
a
bachelor
university
don
however
great
his
literary
attainments
could
do
the
experiment
had
not
been
altogether
a
success
and
need
not
be
repeated
she
sighed
as
she
waved
a
last
and
turned
into
the
house
an
urgent
matter
which
she
had
put
off
until
her
brother
departure
must
now
claim
her
attention
she
ordered
the
entire
fifth
form
together
with
hermie
and
veronica
to
repair
to
the
where
raymonde
was
still
kept
prisoner
the
girls
marched
in
as
quietly
as
if
they
were
going
to
church
their
principal
sat
by
the
table
with
two
little
parallel
lines
of
worry
on
her
usually
smooth
forehead
and
a
grieved
look
in
her
grey
eyes
it
is
very
distressing
to
me
to
be
obliged
to
make
this
enquiry
she
began
but
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
we
find
out
what
has
become
of
those
missing
notes
i
put
you
all
on
your
honour
to
tell
me
what
you
know
can
any
girl
throw
any
light
on
the
matter
she
looked
anxiously
and
wistfully
round
the
little
circle
but
nobody
replied
raymonde
sat
with
downcast
eyes
and
the
old
obstinate
expression
on
her
face
the
eyes
of
all
the
other
girls
were
focused
upon
her
i
am
most
loath
to
accuse
anyone
of
such
a
dreadful
thing
as
taking
money
continued
miss
beasley
but
unless
you
can
offer
me
some
explanation
raymonde
i
shall
be
obliged
to
send
you
home
the
facts
look
very
black
against
you
you
were
treasurer
and
can
not
produce
the
funds
you
were
seen
buying
a
postal
order
and
you
received
a
handsome
fountain
pen
by
post
if
you
please
miss
beasley
interposed
veronica
how
could
raymonde
be
buying
a
postal
order
when
hermie
and
i
saw
her
practising
here
it
is
most
puzzling
i
allow
but
both
sims
the
postmistress
and
west
who
happened
to
be
buying
groceries
in
the
shop
agree
emphatically
that
it
was
raymonde
who
came
to
the
counter
they
say
that
she
was
not
in
school
uniform
but
wore
a
green
dress
and
a
small
cap
raymonde
has
no
green
dress
but
she
has
admitted
to
me
that
she
bought
the
postal
order
the
girls
looked
at
their
chum
in
consternation
raymonde
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
at
this
critical
juncture
there
was
the
sound
of
a
scrimmage
outside
in
the
passage
and
a
loud
excited
voice
was
heard
proclaiming
i
will
go
in
i
tell
you
i
come
to
see
miss
raymonde
armitage
and
it
important
miss
beasley
there
all
the
better
i
want
to
speak
to
her
too
will
you
kindly
move
out
and
let
me
pass
oh
very
well
then
there
the
door
opened
with
a
forcible
jerk
and
a
stranger
entered
unceremoniously
she
was
a
damsel
of
perhaps
fifteen
slim
and
very
pretty
with
twinkling
brown
eyes
and
curly
hair
and
coral
cheeks
she
wore
an
artistic
dress
of
liberty
serge
with
a
picturesque
muslin
collar
and
had
a
chain
of
venetian
beads
round
her
white
throat
the
school
gazed
at
her
spellbound
almost
aghast
the
murmured
veronica
faintly
sinking
into
a
chair
violet
exclaimed
raymonde
in
tones
of
ecstasy
yes
here
i
am
right
enough
announced
the
stranger
cycled
over
directly
i
read
your
letter
stars
and
stripes
you
got
yourself
into
a
jolly
old
mess
hope
they
have
tortured
you
yet
i
suppose
they
still
use
the
rack
and
the
thumbscrew
in
this
benighted
country
cheero
we
pull
you
through
somehow
then
catching
the
principal
amazed
and
outraged
expression
she
continued
sorry
are
you
miss
beasley
i
ought
to
have
introduced
myself
i
do
apologize
my
name
violet
chalmers
and
i
an
american
she
proclaimed
the
fact
proudly
though
her
soft
r
in
american
and
slightly
nasal
intonation
would
have
established
her
nationality
anyway
may
i
ask
your
errand
said
the
head
mistress
rather
stiffly
certainly
i
come
to
help
raymonde
out
of
a
scrape
i
never
dreamed
she
be
landed
in
such
a
queer
business
as
this
i
say
ray
will
you
explain
or
shall
i
do
the
talking
you
please
entreated
raymonde
well
as
i
just
said
i
an
american
we
crossed
the
just
before
the
war
started
and
we
been
stuck
in
this
old
country
ever
since
before
you
all
came
to
the
grange
we
rented
the
place
for
a
year
and
a
time
we
had
of
it
too
with
rats
and
bats
and
burst
pipes
and
no
central
heating
or
electric
light
mother
went
almost
crazy
well
last
easter
when
i
was
staying
at
the
seaside
i
met
raymonde
and
we
chummed
no
end
she
told
me
that
her
school
was
moving
in
here
and
i
bet
her
a
big
box
of
broad
street
turn
up
some
time
in
the
house
and
astonish
the
girls
i
only
bargained
that
she
was
to
let
any
of
them
know
beforehand
of
my
existence
well
i
guess
i
kept
my
word
i
joined
in
a
game
of
one
dark
afternoon
and
i
reckon
i
passed
off
as
a
ghost
did
i
chuckle
just
you
wonder
how
i
got
in
without
anybody
seeing
me
why
i
discovered
the
secret
passage
that
leads
from
a
sliding
panel
in
the
attic
right
under
the
moat
into
a
cave
inside
the
wood
joyce
ferrers
passage
exclaimed
the
girls
the
very
same
i
rode
over
on
my
bicycle
we
staying
only
eight
miles
away
left
it
inside
the
cave
lighted
my
lamp
and
strolled
up
to
the
attic
as
easily
as
you
please
there
was
the
whole
school
tearing
around
like
mad
so
i
scuttled
round
too
and
scared
you
just
some
it
was
so
prime
i
guessed
i
try
it
on
again
that
was
yesterday
week
i
luck
enough
to
catch
raymonde
and
she
was
a
sport
that
day
too
we
changed
clothes
and
i
came
downstairs
here
and
did
her
practising
for
her
while
she
explored
the
secret
passage
and
did
a
little
shopping
on
her
own
account
in
the
village
then
it
was
you
and
not
raymonde
whom
we
saw
sitting
at
the
piano
exclaimed
veronica
violet
nodded
exactly
so
i
guessed
i
was
going
to
be
found
out
and
dare
turn
my
head
when
you
spoke
did
you
see
the
notes
put
into
the
drawer
enquired
miss
beasley
no
but
i
saw
them
afterwards
lying
just
on
the
top
of
some
other
papers
i
locked
the
drawer
before
i
left
the
room
and
put
the
bunch
of
keys
inside
the
pocket
of
raymonde
dress
which
i
had
on
i
meant
to
tell
her
about
it
but
i
forgot
she
was
in
such
a
hurry
when
she
came
back
and
said
she
be
late
for
so
we
each
scrambled
into
our
own
clothes
and
she
tore
off
downstairs
and
i
went
home
this
unfortunately
does
not
bring
us
any
nearer
to
the
solution
of
the
puzzle
what
has
become
of
the
notes
said
miss
beasley
raymonde
could
have
spent
them
in
the
village
when
she
had
gone
out
before
they
were
put
there
ventured
veronica
and
i
certainly
did
abscond
with
them
declared
violet
though
i
really
believe
ray
thinks
so
confess
you
do
old
sport
raymonde
blushed
crimson
i
thought
you
taken
them
for
a
joke
she
said
in
a
low
voice
is
that
why
you
refused
to
explain
interposed
the
principal
quickly
you
were
afraid
of
getting
your
friend
into
trouble
yes
miss
beasley
but
what
become
of
the
wretched
notes
asked
violet
they
must
be
somewhere
have
you
looked
properly
through
this
old
bureau
i
know
these
queer
shallow
drawers
by
experience
and
things
sometimes
slip
over
the
backs
of
them
have
you
had
the
drawer
right
out
it
stuck
has
it
oh
it
probably
only
wants
a
good
pull
lend
me
your
key
here
goes
violet
exerted
all
her
strength
in
a
mighty
tug
and
the
drawer
tumbled
out
with
a
jerk
she
put
in
her
hand
and
felt
about
in
the
space
behind
there
was
a
large
hole
in
the
back
of
the
bureau
and
her
fingers
went
through
it
into
a
cavity
in
the
wall
there
something
queer
here
she
exclaimed
drawing
out
a
round
ball
of
shreds
of
paper
mrs
mouse
nursery
if
i
do
mistake
sorry
to
intrude
but
we
take
a
peep
at
the
children
very
gingerly
she
pulled
aside
the
torn
pieces
of
paper
and
disclosed
to
view
four
little
atoms
not
much
bigger
than
bluebottles
baby
mice
squealed
the
girls
shame
to
disturb
them
but
i
got
to
examine
their
cradle
ah
what
make
of
this
now
if
it
is
a
piece
of
a
note
i
i
swallow
the
babies
you
are
most
undoubtedly
right
declared
miss
beasley
picking
up
the
shreds
of
paper
and
trying
to
piece
them
together
the
mouse
must
have
taken
them
out
of
the
drawer
to
help
to
build
her
nest
rather
an
expensive
nursery
chuckled
violet
well
i
guess
proved
who
the
thief
anyway
i
am
extremely
obliged
to
you
said
miss
beasley
but
for
you
the
matter
might
always
have
remained
a
mystery
and
please
forgive
me
for
interfering
it
was
cheek
i
know
to
turn
up
in
the
attic
but
i
could
resist
the
secret
passage
i
think
this
old
place
must
be
ripping
as
a
school
i
want
to
come
next
term
we
intended
to
go
home
to
new
york
in
september
but
dad
heard
this
morning
he
have
to
stay
here
another
couple
of
years
on
business
so
he
said
he
guessed
i
best
settle
down
and
learn
to
be
a
britisher
would
you
have
me
here
that
depends
on
whether
your
father
wishes
to
send
you
to
me
or
not
oh
dad
let
me
do
anything
i
like
so
it
as
good
as
settled
i
arrive
with
my
boxes
in
september
look
here
it
cheek
again
but
will
you
please
not
scold
raymonde
for
all
this
affair
it
was
mostly
my
fault
raymonde
had
no
business
to
change
places
with
you
and
go
to
the
village
without
leave
said
miss
beasley
eyeing
her
pupil
reprovingly
but
i
think
she
has
been
punished
enough
she
may
take
you
downstairs
now
and
ask
cook
to
give
you
some
cake
and
a
glass
of
milk
before
you
cycle
home
again
thanks
ever
so
i
came
without
my
breakfast
i
real
hungry
now
i
talk
dad
over
and
get
him
to
write
to
you
about
my
coming
to
school
here
i
dead
nuts
on
it
well
murmured
veronica
to
hermie
as
violet
with
a
final
squeeze
of
the
principal
hand
made
her
smiling
exit
well
all
i
can
say
is
that
if
this
american
girl
comes
next
september
there
be
lively
doings
raymonde
bad
enough
but
to
have
two
madcaps
in
the
school
i
thankful
i
leaving
i
pity
the
monitresses
agreed
hermie
